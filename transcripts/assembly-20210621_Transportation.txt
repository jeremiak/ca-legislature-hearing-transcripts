THE SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY UP OVER THE HILL INTO THE BAY AREA AND CONNECT WITH BART- THIS IS THAT NOW UNDER WAY AND NOW THIS BILL DOES A COUPLE CLARIFICATIONS FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION THIS BILL CLARIFIES THAT THE STATUE ENABLES THE AUTHORITY TO OPERATE THE TRAIN. THIS STATUE AS SAYS THE BILL TO LEAD TO LANGUAGE THAT PREVIOUSLY SAID THAT THE CONSTRUCTION POINT THE CONNECTION POINT HAD TO OCCUR IN THE TRI VALLEY AREA AFTER STUDIES WE NOW THINK IT SHOULD BE CONNECTED IN THE SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY AREA. AND LASTLY THE BILL ESTABLISHES THE AUTHORITY AS A REAL TRANSIT DISTRICT FOR PURPOSES OF EXEMPTING THE PROJECT FROM THE LOCAL BUILDING AND ZONING ORDINANCE THIS IS A PROJECT OF TREMENDOUS IMPORTANCE.

CREATED THE RAIL AUTHORITY FOR THE PURPOSE OF PLANNING AND DELIVERING AT TRANSPORTATION. NORTHERN SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY TRAVELING TO THE BAY AREA. ON WHAT'S OFTEN REFERRED TO AS A DIFFICULT MEGA COMMUTE. SINCE IT'S AN INSTANCE CREATION BY THE STATE AT THE END OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THE RAIL AUTHORITY HAS BEEN REALLY BUSY THE FIFTEEN MEMBER AGENCY HAS COMPLETED THE STATE MANDATED FEASIBILITY REPORT WHICH IDENTIFIED THE VALLEY LINK RAIL PROJECT AS THE PREFERRED PROJECT. AND IT'S ALSO COMPLETED THE ENVIRONMENTAL WORK FOR THE PROJECT IN 15% DESIGN AND MOST RECENTLY THE RAIL AUTHORITY DESIGNATED THE SAN JOAQUIN REGIONAL RAIL COMMISSION AS THE PRESUMED OPERATOR ABOUT A LINK. SO THE PROJECT MOVING ALONG EFFICIENTLY AND QUICKLY MAINLY DUE TO THE ENTIRE PROJECT BEING AND IN CURRENTLY EXISTING TRANSPORTATION RIGHTS OF WAY. VALLEY LINKS PROJECTED TO CARRY THIRTY THREE THOUSAND RIDE TODAY- TODAY IT NEARLY EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED FOR THE PROJECT WHICH IS ABOUT A THIRD OF THE FUNDING NEEDED FOR COMPLETION OF THE PROJECT.

AT THE BOARD LEVEL OUR AGENCY PROVIDES A POLICY MAKER TO SERVE ON THE VALLEY LIKE BOARD. AND AT THE EXECUTIVE LEVEL OUR AGENCIES EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR SERVES ON THE BALLOT LINK EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE. WHICH HASDONE A GREAT JOB FOR A PROVIDING CLOSE GUIDANCE. ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PROJECT. OUR STAFF BEEN WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH VALLEY LINK STAFF BARRED STAFF AND THE STAFF OF THE SAN JOAQUIN REGIONAL RAIL COMMISSION. WHICH OPERATES THE A STRAIN. TO PLAN FOR COMPLEMENTARY AND INTEGRATED SERVICE TO ASSESS. THE NEARLY ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DAIRY WORKERS TRAVELLING DAILY FROM THE NORTHERN SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY TO THE BAY AREA. IT IS OF NOTE AND AN EXAMPLE OF THE CLOSE WORKING RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE TRANSIT AGENCIES. THAT THE SAN JOAQUIN REGIONAL RAIL COMMISSION WAS NAMED TO BE PRESENT OPERATOR FOR VALLEY LINK AND BOTH BOARDS UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED INITIAL AND WILL USE FOR THIS PURPOSE. WE RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF CLARIFYING THAT THE VALLEY LINK BOARD HAS THE AUTHORITY TO OPERATE DEVELOPING TRAIN SYSTEM WHICH GIVES THEM THE ABILITY TO DESIGNATE AN OPERATOR.

THIS BILL IS ALSO AN ATTEMPT TO SECURE BUREAUCRATIC IMMORTALITY. BECAUSE THEY BE SEVEN FIFTY EIGHT DID NOT GIVE THE AUTHORITY THE POWER TO OPERATE THE LEGISLATURE CLEARLY INTENDED FOR THIS AGENCY TO SUNSET AFTER IT DELIVERED ITS PROJECT SIMILAR TO THE FORT HILL CONSTRUCTION AUTHORITY IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. THE VERY LAST THING THE BAY AREA NEEDS IS YET ANOTHER TRANSIT OPERATING AGENCY. AS RAIL ADVOCATES OUR ORGANIZATION HAS WORKED FOR DECADES ON FASTER RAIL TRANSPORTATION IN THE ALTAMONTE QUARTER IN OUR EXPERT OPINION THIS PROJECT IS A MULTI BILLION DOLLAR WASTE OF MONEY. IT IS INTENDED TO BRING PEOPLE BY TRAIN TO ANOTHER TRAIN INSTEAD OF TAKING THEM DIECTLY WHERE THEY ACTUALLY WANT TO GO WHICH IS SILICON VALLEY THAT'S WHERE THE JOBS ARE. THOSE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS COULD DO SO MUCH MORE TO MOVE PEOPLE BETWEEN THE VALLEY AND THE BAY AREA IF THEY WERE SPENT ON A SENSIBLE PROJECT TO SPEED UP A- THE TRAIN RIDERS ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA RESPECTFULLY URGES A NO VOTE.

TWO TWENTY SEVEN WELCOME THANK YOU MA'AM SURE MEMBERS AND SO I'M A PLEASURE TO BE BACK ON THE GREEN CARPET WITH YOU THIS AFTERNOON. I'M GONNA BE PRESENTING SP TWO TWO SEVEN. FIRST OFF I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE CHAIR AND TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR HARD WORK AND CRAFTING THE BILL THAT WORKS FOR ALL PARTIES. I AM PLEASED TO SHARE THAT I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS SUGGESTED BY THE COMMITTEE OUTLINED ON PAGES FIVE AND SIX IN THE ANALYSIS. WITH THESE AMENDMENTS I'M GLAD TO ANNOUNCE ALL OPPOSITION HAS BEEN REMOVED. BUT THE COMMITTEE MEHMET SENATE BILL TWO TWO SEVEN WILL REQUIRE COMPETITION OFF HIGHWAY VEHICLES TO BE REGISTERED IN ORDER TO RIDE ON PUBLIC LANDS. WITH OR WITHOUT THE BILL COMPETITION OAG WRITING IS RESTRICTED TO CLOSED COURSES.UNDER THE FEDERAL CLEAN AIR ACT. CURRENTLY COMPETITION OFF HIGHWAY VEHICLES ARE REGISTERED TO CARBS RED STICKER PROGRAM. TWO YEARS AGO CARP DECIDED TO IN THIS REGISTER PROGRAM IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AND NO OTHER AGENCY PUT TOGETHER A PLAN TO REPLACE THE PROGRAM. WITHOUT A NEW PROGRAM COMPETITION ALWAYS BE WRITERS WILL NOT BE ABLE TO GET A DMV TITLE AND REGISTRATION. THAT IS REQUIRED FOR A DEALER TO FINANCE A NEW PURCHASE OR FOR AN OWNER TO SECURE INSURANCE. ADDITIONALLY LAW ENFORCEMENT IS NOT ABLE TO TRACK TRACE AND SITE ILLEGAL AND ROGUE- H. V. WRITING IF THE VEHICLE HAS NOT BEEN REGISTERED THROUGH THE DMV. MY OFFICE HAS BEEN ALMOST TWO YEARS WORKINGWITH STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING ONLY TO BE COMPETITION OR ORGANIZATIONS- HV MANUFACTURES AND SEVERAL STATE AGENCIES. SB TWO TWO SEVEN HAD STRONG BIPARTISAN SUPPORT IN THE SENATE. AND HAS SEVERAL BIPARTISAN CO AUTHORS IN BOTH HOUSES. AND I'VE GOT- MADAM CHAIRMAN A COUPLE WITNESSES I BELIEVE IN THE GALLERY TO SPEAK IN FAVOR OF THE BILL. YES AND I HAVE TO GO AND VOTE IN ARTS BUT BEFORE I GO BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHEN I'M COMING BACK EXACTLY I WANT TO THANK YOU. FOR TAKING THE MOMENTUM FOR BEING SO WILLING TO WORK WITH US- ON THIS BILL I WOULD VERY MUCH APPRECIATE IT WITHOUT ANY CHALLENGE OVER THE MICROPHONE. TO MR FONG THANK YOU. WILL PROCEED WITH A YOUR FIRST WITNESS- MR MCHALE. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE TERRY MCHALE WITH ERIN READ NECESSITATES REPRESENTING A CONSORTIUM OF OFF HIGHWAY VEHICLE RECREATIONISTS. IN THE PAST I CAN'T THINK OF LEGISLATION THAT'S MORE CONTROVERSY OVER AN OFF HIGHWAY VEHICLE RECREATION THIS SITUATION LIKELY IS DIFFERENT. THIS LEGISLATION AS A RESULT OF COMPROMISE. AND COLLABORATION BETWEEN THE- HBK. IN AND OTHER STATES. IT CERTAINLY THE DEATH. IT ALSO RECOGNIZES THE COMP MOTORCYCLE RACING WE BRINGS ME OF TO THIS OF. IS A STAPLE EARLY. CONTINUES BEFORE ALSO CONTINUES THE FISCAL STRUCTURE OF PLACING REGISTRATION AND COMPETITION STICKERS ON COMP ON COMPETITION VEHICLES IN CONTINUING THE REGULATION THE ENFORCEMENT OF OFF HIGHWAY VEHICLE WRECKED RECREATION AND TAKING CARE OF ENVIRONMENTAL NEEDS. WE WANT TO THANK SENATOR JONES AND HIS STAFF FOR ALL THE WORK WE HAVE DONE ON THIS AND THE OTHER STAKEHOLDERS FOR THEIR WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH US AND WE ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. ON SB TWO TWO SEVEN THANK YOU. I THINK YOU HAVE TO GET. THE US WILL GO TO JEAN TURNER. HELLO MY NAME IS JEAN TURNER I'M A FREELANCE JOURNALIST IN THE MOTORCYCLE INDUSTRY I SPENT NEARLY EIGHTEEN YEARS WRITING AND WRITING OFF ROAD DIRT BIKES ARE NOT ONLY MY LIVELIHOOD BUT A WAY OF LIFE FOR MYSELF MY FRIENDS AND MY FAMILY. I'M HERE TO SPEAK TODAY TO YOU AS A JUDGE NOT AS A JOURNALIST BUT AS A CALIFORNIA RESIDENT AND OFF ROAD ENTHUSIASTS. THE CARD PLAN TO SUNSET THE RED STICKER PROGRAM HAS LEFT A LOT OF OUR COMMUNITY FEELING LEFT IN LIMBO WITHOUT THE ABILITY TO REGISTER ENTITLE ARE OFFERED MOTORCYCLES THERE IS CONFUSION AS TO THE FUTURE OF OUR SUPPORT. OF NOT ONLY RECREATIONAL USE OF COMPETITION VEHICLES BUT AMATEUR COMPETITION MOTORCYCLE EVENTS AND WHETHER OR NOT THE GOVERNMENT IS CLOSING IN ON OUR WAY OF LIFE. I TOOK IT UPON MYSELF TO CREATE AN INFORMATIONAL VIDEO ON THE CURRENT RED STICKER SUNSET TO HELP CLARIFY WHAT'S HAPPENING AND WHAT IT ALL MEANS GOING FORWARD NOW THAT THE TWENTY TWENTY TWO DIRT BIKES ARE ARRIVING. THE VIDEO HAS RECEIVED OVER A THOUSAND VIEWS IN FOUR DAYS AND HAS PROMPTED DOZENS OF COMMENTS QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS FROM OUR COMMUNITY. I'VE BEEN CONTACTED BY FAMILIES WHO ARE WONDERING IF THEY SHOULD HOLD OFF ON PURCHASING NEW DIRT BIKES I'VE SPOKEN TO DEALERS WHO ARE CONCERNED THAT PEOPLE ARE BEING DISSUADED FROM BUYING NEW BIKES. WITHOUT ANY TYPE OF TITLE REGISTRATION AVAILABLE IT FEELS AS THOUGH THE SIGNIFICANT PURCHASES ARE NOT PROTECTED AND COULD RUN INTO COMPLICATIONS WITH THINGS LIKE FINANCE TRANSPORTATION AND INSURANCE. I WOULD LIKE TO ADD THAT I UNDERSTAND THE RED STICKER PROGRAM WAS NEVER DESIGNED TO BE A PERMANENT SOLUTION AND THAT THE ONLY TO BE COMPETITION COMMUNITY. MUST DO OUR PART TO CONTRIBUTE TO REDUCE EMISSIONS. I GREW UP IN LOS ANGELES AND AS A CHILD OF THE EIGHTIES BELIEVE ME I UNDERSTAND THE PROGRESS THERE THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD. AND THAT IT MUST CONTINUE. BUT I FEEL THIS CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED WITHOUT RELEGATING THE CURRENT OFFERED COMPETITION COMMUNITY TO A SHADOW POPULATION. THAT WILL NOT ONLY BE UNABLE TO ENJOY LEGAL LAND USE BUT WILL NO LONGER BE ACTIVELY CONTRIBUTING TO LAND MANAGEMENT. SUSTAINING ARE RIDING AREAS UNDER THE NEW CAR REGULATION. MY HOPE IS THAT THE PASSAGE OF SB TWO TWO SEVEN WILL NOT ONLY HELP MY INDUSTRY AND COMMUNITY TO MOVE FORWARD. WITH THE ABILITY TO FINANCE AND SECURE THEIR PURCHASES. BUT WILL HELP FACILITATE A GREATER NET EFFECT OF WORKING TOGETHER TO REACH NEW EMISSIONS TARGETS WITH MINIMAL DAMAGE TO OUR INDUSTRY. I RESPECTFULLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO SUPPORT THIS MEASURE. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I BELIEVE THE MEHMET'S REMOVE OPPOSITION BUT WE HAVE TO LISTED- TWO INDIVIDUALS LISTED AND IN OPPOSITION- AS WELL BARRETT. ON THE PHONE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'M WILL BARRETT I'M THE DIRECTOR OF CLEAN AIR ADVOCACY FOR THE AMERICAN LUNG% ASSOCIATION- THE LUNG ASSOCIATION WAS OPPOSED TO THE LEGISLATION AND PRINT THAT WOULD OVERRIDE THE HEALTH BENEFITS OF CLEAN AIR REGULATIONS RELATED TO EMISSIONS NON COMPLIANT OFF HIGHWAY.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR VICE CHAIR GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS SB THREE SEVENTY TWO ESTABLISHES THE MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE I THINK A- SENATOR JONES I THINK YOU LEFT YOUR PHONE HERE. YES. I WILL SAVE IT FOR YOU LET ME START OVER THREE SEVENTY TWO ESTABLISHES THE MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE FLEET PURCHASING ASSISTANCE PROGRAM WHICH WILL BE ESTABLISHED IN THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD AND ADMINISTERED BY THE CALIFORNIA POLLUTION CONTROL FINANCING AUTHORITY THIS PROGRAM WILL IN CONSULTATION WITH STAKEHOLDERS DESIGN NEW FINANCING TOOLS TO HELP OWNERS OF MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES PURCHASED CLEANER ZERO EMISSION ALTERNATIVES AS MANY OF YOU ARE AWARE OF MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS AND BUSES ARE A MAJOR SOURCE OF AIR POLLUTION IN CALIFORNIA CONTRIBUTING TO POOR AIR QUALITY IN NEGATIVE RESPIRATORY HEALTH OUTCOMES. THESE EMISSIONS HURT THE HEALTH OF CALIFORNIANS ESPECIALLY THOSE IN UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES AND DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED POPULATIONS REPLACING THESE VEHICLES WITH ZERO EMISSION ALTERNATIVES IS NEEDED TO REDUCE THE HARMFUL AIR POLLUTION IT NEGATIVELY IMPACTS PUBLIC HEALTH AND WORSENS CLIMATE CHANGE CALIFORNIA'S CURRENT SOLUTION FOR FINANCING THE TRANSITION TO ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES HAVE A VOUCHER AND GRANT PROGRAMS IN ORDER TO MEET THE DIVERSE FINANCIAL NEEDS OF CURRENT AND FUTURE FLEET OWNERS IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THE STATE PUTS MORE TOOLS IN THE TOOLBOX. TRANSITIONING PLEASE SHOULD BE STRAIGHTFORWARD AND EQUITABLE WELL FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO LIVE IN THE AREAS WITH HIGH CONCENTRATIONS OF DIESEL POLLUTION EVER THE BUSINESS OWNERS WHO MANAGE THESE VEHICLES THE INTENT OF THIS BILLS TO GET THE STATE TO THINK CREATIVELY ABOUT HOW WE CAN BEST LEVERAGE STATE FUNDS BRING IMPACT PRIVATE CAPITAL IN INSTANCES WHERE THAT MAKES SENSE TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO MAXIMIZE THE ABILITY FOR FLEETS OF ALL SIZES TO TRANSITION TO ZERO EMISSION OPTIONS. SB THREE SEVENTY TWO WILL CREATE A ONE STOP SHOP WEBSITE TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT ALL PERTINENT POTENTIAL FINANCING GRANT OPTIONS AND OTHER TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THAT IS AVAILABLE TO HELP OF TEAM FINANCING FOR THOSE VEHICLES WE KNOW THE TRANSITIONING TO ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES IS A KEY COMPONENT. TO ENSURING BETTER HEALTH AND ECONOMIC BENEFITS FOR. AS WELL AS HAVING A ROBUST AND CREATIVE FINANCING TOOLS THAT WILL HELP TO ACCELERATE. OUR ABILITY TO GET CLEANER AND GREENER TRUCKS ON THE ROAD. WITH ME HERE ODD TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OR MICHAEL COLEMAN WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE FUND THE BILL MCGOVERN WITH THE COALITION FOR CLEAN AIR THEY'RE BOTH CALLING IN MEMBERS WITH APPROPRIATE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. WE'VE MOTION SECOND AT THE AT THE CENTER LEYVA WE WILL NOW MOVE TO- TO MICHAEL COLVIN WAS THAT WITH THE FIRST ANIMAL IN A BILL SECOND. YES HI GOOD AFTERNOON- MEMBERS OF THE TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE MY NAME IS MICHAEL COLEMAN WITH CONTAMINANTS AND FUND WE ARE THE PROUD SPONSORS THE SENATE BILL THREE SEVEN TO CLEANER AND GREENER TRUCKS. IN MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY VEHICLE MARKET WHICH INCLUDES EVERYTHING FROM HEAVY TRUCKS DELIVERY VANS THE CITY BUSES AND GARBAGE TRUCKS. IS TRANSITIONING. TO INTERMISSION PETER. THIS TRANSITION WILL HAVE BEEN OUT AND ON ARTS WAS BY PA. ESPECIALLY WHEN CONSIDERING LOCAL AIR POLLUTION THE THIRTY HELP IMPROVEMENTS. CALIFORNIA CANNOT TRANSFORM THIS MARKET IF YOU CAN PUBLIC FUNDS IT IS TIME TO BRING IN PRIVATE CAPITAL TO GENERATE LEVERAGE IN ORDER TO MAKE THIS TRANSITION AS EXPEDIENT AND EQUITABLE A POSSIBLE. SENATE BILL THREE SEVEN. IT SHE'S THREE KEEPER. BURKE IT'S A PLACE CALLED LIKE MONEY ACCORDING NEEDED MOST BY 75% OF THE TO ARE VULNERABLE. I TO THANK OUR INVITE JUSTICE PARTNERS REQUIRED WITH- THAT'S ON THE TECHNICIAN. SECOND IT ENABLES PRIVATE INVESTMENT AND FINANCING OPTIONS FOR ALL FLEET SIZES BY DIRECTING THE CALIFORNIA POLLUTION CONTROL FINANCING AUTHORITY TO UTILIZE THEIR EXISTING RELATIONSHIPS WITH PRIVATE FINANCING INSTITUTION AND WHAT THE TALK TRUCKING INDUSTRY. EDS HE'S THAT FINANCING AUTHORITY AT A CRITICAL IMPLEMENTING PARTNER. IN THIRD IT TARGETS THE FULL SET OF RELEVANT BARRIERS RELEVANT TO THE FLEET TRANSITION HAVING THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD AT THE ADMINISTRATING AGENCY ENABLED HIS COORDINATION INCLUDING THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ONE STOP SHOP WEBSITE. DONE RIGHT SB THREE SEVEN TO PULL DELIVER CRITICAL SOCIETAL AND ECONOMIC BENEFITS INCLUDING COULD INCREASE PUBLIC HEALTH REDUCE CLIMATE POLLUTION LOWER LIFECYCLE COSTS FOR THE OPERATOR OF THE VEHICLE. I'D LIKE TO THANK SENATOR LEYVA AND HER SOCCER THERE CLEAR FEET LISTEN ENTIRELY CLEAR SAID. AND I ENCOURAGED HER AYE VOTE THANK YOU. I THINK WE SHOULD CALL THE WILL NOW MOVE TO BILL MCGOVERN PLEASE PROCEED. IT GOOD AFTERNOON COMMITTEE MEMBER BILL MCGOVERN WITH THE COALITION FOR CLEAN AIR IN SUPPORT OF SB THREE SEVENTY TWO. THE MOVEMENT OF GOODS BY TRUCK IS- ESSENTIAL CORE KANEMI BUT ALSO A MAJOR CONTRIBUTOR TO AIR POLLUTION IN CALIFORNIA AND SO WE NEED TO CLEAN UP. THE TRUCKING SECTOR AND BURLY RAPIDLY- AND WE CAN DO THAT WE CAN MOVE GOODS WITHOUT INFLICTING TOXIC DIESEL EXHAUST AND OUR COMMUNITIES. SO THIS BILL WILL PROVIDE-IMPORTANT FINANCING TOOLS THAT WILL COMPLEMENT SOME OF THE REGULATORY MEASURES THAT HAVE BEEN ADOPTED OR ON THEIR WAY TO ADOPTION AT THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD. AND WE THINK SOME OF THE STRONG FEATURES OF THE BILL INCLUDE ITS FOCUS ON UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES- PORT TRUCKS. IN ON SMALL WEEKS. FOR ALL THESE REASONS WE URGE YOU TO APPROVE THE BILL. TODAY TO THIS COMMITTEE THANK YOU. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH I DON'T BELIEVE WE HAVE ANY WITNESSES LISTED IN OPPOSITION- SO WILL NOW GO TO THE PUBLIC- SEE IS THERE ANYONE IN THE CHAMBERS I LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF.

VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR WORK ON ON THIS TOPIC- WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR WHICH IS RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND. WE HAVE A ROLL CALL PLEASE. THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO NATURAL RESOURCES FRIEDMAN. HI FRIEDMAN HI FONG. FONG I BERMAN. BERMAN I CUNNINGHAM. CUNNINGHAM I DALY DALY AYE DAVIES. GIPSON GIPSON I KALRA. KALRA I LEE. LEE AYE MEDINA MEDINA I NAZARIAN NAZARIAN I WENT. WHEN I O'DONNELL O'DONNELL I WARD. WARD I WICKS WICKS HI FOURTEEN ZERO THANK YOU THE BILLS OUT WILL BE THE ROLE OPEN THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU MEMBERS THANK YOU I THINK I SEE SENATOR MEN. WELCOME SIR YOU'RE HERE WITH SB FIVE HUNDRED YOU CAN BEGIN WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU CHAIR FRIEDMAN THANK YOU MEMBERS I WANT TO THANK THE STAFF FOR THEIR DILIGENT WORK ON THIS MEASURE LAST FRIDAY WE CAME IN AGREEMENT WITH OPPOSITION. AND ARE PREPARED TO ACCEPT AMENDMENTS THAT CLARIFIES THE ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE REQUIREMENTS ON THIS BILL ONLY APPLY TO TAUNUS VEHICLES WITH THE MODEL YEAR TWENTY THIRTY ONE OR LATER AND ONLY THOSE THAT ARE UNDER EIGHT THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED ONE POUNDS RATHER THAN TEN THOUSAND ONE POUNDS AS ORIGINALLY STATED IN OUR BILL. HIS NAME IS ALSO MAKE CLARIFYING CHANGES THE DEFINITION OF A ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE TO MATCH THE EXISTING DEFINITION IN LAW AS WELL AS TO REFLECT THE DEFINITION OF ECONOMIST VEHICLE AS SPECIFIED IN THE IN THE REGULATIONS. SO I PRESENT TO YOU SB FIVE HUNDRED WHICH REQUIRES ALL NEW LIGHT DUTY AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES TO BE ZERO EMISSION BY TWENTY THIRTY. THIS IS A COMMON SENSE MEASURE THAT WILL ALLOW OUR STATE TO HELP REACHES AND VICIOUS YET NECESSARY CLEANER GOALS ESPECIALLY AS WE KNOW THE VEHICLE EXHAUST IS NOT ONLY TOXIC IN IN RELEASING TOXIC POLLUTANTS BUT IS ONE OF THE MAIN DRIVERS. OF CARBON EMISSIONS I WILL HELP US TO REACH GOVERNOR JERRY BROWN'S EXECUTIVE ORDER OF ATTAINING FIVE MILLION JOBS ON THE ROAD BY TWENTY THIRTY. AND GOVERNOR GAVIN NEWSOM'S. ANNOUNCEMENT TO TRY TO COMPLETELY PHASE OUT GASOLINE POWERED CARS BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE. THE TENNESSEE ECKELS ARE OUR FUTURE AND THERE ON THE HORIZON SOONER THAN WE THINK- AND DUE TO TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES- THEY CAN CLEARLY BE PART OF A CLEAN EQUITABLE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM. PROVIDED THAT THEY ARE ZERO EMISSIONS AND HELP TO SUPPORT A MULTI MODAL TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM. WE NEED SMART POLICIES TO HELP STEER AV DEPLOYMENT. ALONG WITH OTHER PARTS OF OUR TRANSIT SYSTEM TOWARDS A SHARED YOUR MISSION FUTURE. WHICH IS WHY WE HAVE INTRODUCED THIS BILL- AV TECHNOLOGY IS NOT SOMETHING THAT IS SCIENCE FICTION AT THIS POINT BUT A REALITY OF THE VERY NEAR FUTURE- AS YOU PROBABLY ALL KNOW WE HAVE OUR FIRST ADDS ON THE ROAD ALREADY. AND MANY MORE WILL BE ON THE WAY. THEY CAN EITHER BE CONTRIBUTORS TO MORE CARBON EMISSIONS OR THEY CAN HELP TO STEER OUR FLEET. OF TRANSPORTATION IN THE STATE TOWARDS YOUR EMISSIONS. BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE HARDWARE IS ALREADY HERE- I PURCHASED MY OWN FIRST HYDROGEN FUEL CELL CAR JUST A WEEK AGO. AND WE THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT'S WAY OUT THERE THE HARDWARE IS OUTPACING THE SOFTWARE AT THIS POINT. IS MUCH EASIER TO GET A ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE TODAY THAN TO GET AN AUTOMATED VEHICLE. AND I THINK IT MAKES COMMON SENSE IT'S GOOD PRECEDENT TO SET BEFORE WE DEPLOY A LOT OF ATVS ON THE ROAD. TO REQUIRE THAT THE B. ZERO MISSION. THIS MEASURE SUPPORTED BY A BROAD COALITION ENVIRONMENTAL PUBLIC HEALTH AND LABOR GROUPS- THOMAS VEHICLES MAY BE ABLE TO DRIVE THEMSELVES BUT WE NEED TO STEER THEM IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION SO- I URGE YOU TO CONSIDER THIS VOTE AND VOTE I'D- AND WITH ME ON THE LINE TODAY TO TESTIFY HAVE ELIZABETH URBAN. SENIOR TRANSPORTATION ANALYST FOR THE UNION OF CONCERNED SCIENTISTS AND NADIA ANDERSON SENIOR GOVERNMENT MANAGER FOR A CRUISE. A LEADING. ECONOMIST VEHICLE COMPANY. THANK YOU WITH THE MOST A SECOND ONE NUMBER TO THE SUPPORT WITNESSES ON THE TELEPHONE OPERATOR IF YOU COULD OPEN THE LINE FOR ELIZABETH IRVINE. THANK YOUR LINE IS OPEN. GOOD AFTERNOON CAN YOU HEAR ME YES. GREAT THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO THE COMMITTEE THIS TIME IN SUPPORT OF SB FIVE HUNDRED WHICH WOULD REQUIRE AUTOMATED VEHICLES TO BE DEPLOYED AS EUROVISION VEHICLE- AS I MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY EASIER TO SEE THE NATION'S LEADING SCIENCE BASED NONPROFIT PUTTING RIGOROUS INDEPENDENT SCIENCE TO WORK TO SOLVE OUR PLANET'S MOST PRESSING PROBLEMS. EXPERT CONSENSUS THAT ELECTRIFYING A VISA IS ONE OF THE ESSENTIAL COMPONENTS TO ENSURING THAT THEY'RE A PART OF THE SUSTAINABLE- PART OF OUR TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM. FOR EXAMPLE RECENT RESEARCH BY UC DAVIS FOUND THAT PERSONALLY OWNED AB IS ARE LIKELY TO SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED WITH A LARGE PORTION OF THOSE MILD COMING WINDOW PASSENGERS IN THE VEHICLE. THEY ALSO FOUND THAT EITHER LIKELY TO SHIFT PEOPLE AWAY FROM LOWER EMISSION THOUGH IT'S LIKE PUBLIC TRANSIT. UCS RESEARCH FOUND THAT THE POTENTIAL FOR EIGHTIES TO INCREASE EMISSIONS AND AIR POLLUTION EVEN IN A SCENARIO WHERE POLICIES ENCOURAGE PULLING IN TRANSIT. OUR RESEARCH ALSO FOUND THAT NEGATIVE IMPACTS SUCH AS CONGESTION AIR POLLUTION WERE LIKELY TO HAPPEN DISPROPORTIONATELY IN COMMUNITIES ALREADY EXPERIENCING ENVIRONMENTAL INJUSTICES. WE CAN ALSO FROM THE RAPID DEPLOYMENT OF RIDE HAILING WHICH UCS AND CARD HAVE FOUND TO INCREASE EMISSIONS COMPARED TO PERSONAL CARDS. ACCORDING TO UCS ANALYSIS THE AVERAGE RIDE HAILING TRIP IS TRAINS THEY REPLACE. THESE REPORTS AND OTHERS HIGHLIGHT THE NEED TO DEPLOY AB IS AS THAT IN ORDER TO MITIGATE EMISSIONS IMPACT. AS PART OF A BROADER STRATEGY TO REDUCE EMISSIONS FROM TRANSPORTATION. THE OVERALL DIRECTION OF CALIFORNIA POLICIES CLEAR WE ARE MOVING TOWARD A ZERO EMISSION TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS AND EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES LIKE. AUTOMATED VEHICLES SHOULD BE LEADING THE WAY. THIS BILL IS CONSISTENT WITH OTHER GOVERNMENT ACTIONS. SUCH AS THE EXECUTIVE ORDERS THE TENDERNESS MENTIONED- REQUIRING TRANSITION TO JOBS AND CARS AND PASSENGER TRUCKS- CALPERS DRAFT FRAMEWORK WHICH WAS DEPLOYMENT OF ZERO EMISSION AV IS AS PART OF ITS FIRST GUIDING PRINCIPLE. THAT CLEAN MILE STANDARD APPROVED A MONTH AGO TODAY BY CARD THAT REQUIRES RIDE. HAILING VEHICLES TO TRANSITION TO THAT. I AND I SHOULD MENTION THE TYPICALLY MOUNTED A ALREADY THE SECOND BUT NOT ALL EIGHTIES WHICH POINTS THE NEED FOR. THE BILL AS WELL. I AND JUST TO CLOSE ONE OF MENTION THAT COME ALREADY DEPLOYED ELECTRIC IF. ACCORDING TO THE STATE'S DISENGAGEMENT REPORTS ABOUT 50% OF THE TESTING MILES IN TWENTY TWENTY WERE EECTRIC. THE TECHNOLOGY IS FEASIBLE NECESSARY AND CONSISTENT WITH EIGHT GOALS. GIVEN THESE FACTORS. DEPLOYING A BEES POWERED BY FOSSIL FUELS IN CALIFORNIA WOULD BE LIKE TO PLAYING A SMARTPHONE WITH A ROTARY DIAL FINISH UP PLEASE. YES THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY AND RESPECTFULLY ASK YOU TO VOTE IN FAVOR OF SB FIVE HUNDRED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- NADIA ANDERSON IS NEXT. OPERATOR. FIND IT OPEN. FRIEDMAN AND EFFECTIVE COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY MY NAME IS NOT A ANDERSON I'M A NUMBER CREATED GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS TEAM AND HE TAKES A CRACK AT THE FOR SB FIVE HUNDRED CREW THE ALL ELECTRIC SELF DRIVING COMPANY WITH A MISSION TO BUILD THE WORLD'S MOST ADVANCED VEHICLE THAT THEY CAN CONNECT TO PLACES THANK AND EXPERIENCE TODAY CARE ABOUT. WE HAVE FOUND IT ON THE THAT YOU ADEQUATE TODAY FUNDS FALSE IN CARBON POLLUTION IS ONE THE MAIN REASONS WHY TODAY CHECK THE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR OVER 4% OF HOW CAN EMISSIONS AND HOW THESE KIND OF CRISES DIRECT AND IMPACT ON OUR COMMUNITY WE BELIEVE THAT THE CAR ENGINE. CONVINCINGLY MITIGATE THESE MEGA KAT. I CREE WE BELIEVE IN CHALLENGING THE- QUO. OUR VEHICLE BEEN ALL OF THAT YOU THE DAYS. IN CALIFORNIA HAPPENED 100% BY RENEWABLE AND- GENERATED RIGHT HERE AND I HOME STATE COMPLAINING. S. FIVE OFFER OUR SUPPORT OF SB FIVE HUNDRED. OVER PAKISTAN TO WITHDRAW COALITION INCLUDING SEVERAL IN A INTEREST. ENVIRONMENTALISTS LABOR AND PUBLIC HEALTH GROUP. ARE YOU TO SUPPORT THE THAT. YOU FOR BUT WAY TO CALIFORNIA TEACHER ECONOMICALLY ANYBODY. AND THEN AGAIN THE CLEAR. AND MISSION. IN AND PUSH NEEDED TO SUPPORT CARD. THAT ARE STATE APART. AN EXISTING UP IN A POSITION OF THE SHINING. OF THE ENERGY TRYING. AND TRANSIT SUPPLY IN THE COMING. AT THE STATE WE NEED TO TAKE EVERY STEP OF RIGHT NOW. TO REDUCE OUR MISSION. STARTING WHEN THE MAIN. THE TRANSPORTATION. SB FIVE HUNDRED CAL HAVE OFFERED. TAKE ANOTHER STEP TOWARD ME I AM BASICALLY NICKEL AND THAT THE THING OF HOW WE BUILD BE ABLE TO. FOR TO.

THANK YOU BUT VENTURE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS ARIELLE WALL MY SERVICE GENERAL COUNSEL TO THE SELF DRIVING COALITION FOR SAFER STREETS THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY AND SB FIVE HUNDRED. BUT WE BACKGROUND SELF DRIVING COALITION IS COMPRISED OF FIFTEEN OF THE WORLD'S LEADING AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES ACROSS. THE TECHNOLOGY RIDE SCHERING TRUCKING AND AUTOMOTIVE SECTORS PERMITTED TO OUR MISSION IS TO BRING THE BENEFITS OF FULLY SELF DRIVING VEHICLES TO CONSUMERS AND SUPPORT THE SAFE AND SWIFT DEPLOYMENT THE TECHNOLOGY. WITH RESPECT SB FIVE HUNDRED WE HAVE BEEN CONCERNED THAT THE BILL COULD DELAY THE ROLLOUT OF AB. IN THE STATE AND THEN I CALIFORNIA BENEFITS OFFERED BY AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE TECHNOLOGY WHICH COULD INCLUDE PREVENTING THOUSANDS OF ROADWAY FATALITIES HOWEVER. AS SENATOR MAY NOTED WE UNDERSTAND THERE HAS BEEN AGREEMENT ON AMENDMENTS THAT IF ADOPTED WOULD ACT TO MITIGATE THESE CONCERNS AS A RESULT THE SELF DRIVING COALITION IS PREPARED TO REMOVE OUR OPPOSITION TO THE BILL SHOULD THESE AMENDMENTS BE ADOPTED IN THE FORM THAT WE HAVE SEEN. WE GREATLY APPRECIATE THE WILLINGNESS OF SENATOR MAN IN THE COMMITTEE TO WORK WITH AB DEVELOPERS ON A COMPROMISE WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING TO ENSURE EIGHTIES CONTRIBUTE THE CALIFORNIA'S ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS. IN A MANNER THAT CONTINUES TO ALLOW FOR THE SAFE AND SWIFT DEPLOYMENT OF ALL A. B. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU DO WE HAVE. CAMERON TO MEET HER. ON THE LINE.

THE AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS ME AS THE RECORD FROM THE CALTRAIN TO EUROPE COMMERCE WE ARE NOT OPPOSED UNLESS AMENDED POSITION BILLION ACCORDING TO ANYTHING OPPOSITIONAL MALL. DESCRIBED THANK YOU I'M AT SEVEN PLEASE GO OUT. GOOD AFTERNOON THIS IS PETER LAREAU WHEN YOURS FROM THE SILICON VALLEY LEADERSHIP GROUP AND WE HAVE A MOST UNLESS OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION ON THE BILL FOR THE REASONS OUTLINED IN OUR LETTER AND THOSE AMENDMENTS WERE OUTLINED EARLIER TODAY BY THE AUTHOR. THANK YOU. THANK YOU I HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENTS THANK YOU AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU WITHOUT WILL GO TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. VICE CHAIR FONG. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH CHAIR- A FEW QUESTIONS TO THE SENATOR- I APPRECIATE. YOUR WORK- WITH THE AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE INDUSTRY. ESPECIALLY IN CRAFTING THESE AMENDMENTS I DO WANT TO ASK DO YOU TO QUESTIONS THAT. ARE OUR BROAD BUT THERE THE BASIC QUESTIONS I GUESS THAT SAID OF THE FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE AT HAND WHICH IS YOU AND I WOULD BOTH AGREE- THAT THE THAT THE AV SPACE IS STILL RAPIDLY EVOLVING AND DYNAMIC AND I AM A FAN OF THE CERTAINLY THE PSYCHOLOGY. AND WANTED TO GROW AND MATURE. SO CAN I JUST ASK. WHY PLACE A MANDATE. ON SUCH A NEW INDUSTRY RIGHT NOW WHEN IT HASN'T FULLY. BEEN INTEGRATED INTO SOCIETY. AND SECONDLY HI ARE ARE THERE ANY CONCERNS THAT. TAKE THAT AS A STATE CALIFORNIA MAYBE PLACING OURSELVES. AT A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE- AS MEMBERS OTHER STATES OUR NEIGHBORING STATES- ARE TRYING TO ATTRACT. A THOMAS VEHICLE INNOVATORS TO THEIR TO THEIR STATES AND WITH THEIR LOCATIONS. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION VICE CHAIR I APPRECIATE THEM- ON THE FIRST QUESTION I GUESS THIS GETS YOUR THEORY OF WHAT ANY REGULATIONS MEANT TO DO I THINK FROM MY PERSPECTIVE IS THE AUTHOR. THIS REGULATIONS MEANT TO HELP STEER THE DEPLOYMENT OF AV'S IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION SO THAT THEY THIS IS AN AREA WHERE WE DON'T WANT REMAIN AGNOSTIC ON THE TYPES OF TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE USED TO POWER THESE CARS. WE REALLY DO WANT AN EASIER MISSION SO WE WANT THAT PROCESS TO START NOW THIS BILL GIVES THEM PLENTY OF FOREWARNING AS THEIR TESTING AND I SHOULD NOTE THAT THERE IS NO PROHIBITION ON TESTING AB TECHNOLOGY ON GAS POWERED CARS. IT'S JUST THAT WHEN THEY DEPLOY- THEY ARE REQUIRED TO BE ZERO EMISSIONS BY TWENTY THIRTY OR LATER AND I THINK THAT IS A WORTHWHILE GOAL BECAUSE AS WAS MENTIONED THERE IS SIGNIFICANT CONCERN THAT ABC. WILL ACTUALLY ADD SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS OF PASSENGER VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED BUT ON TOP OF THAT WE ARE TRYING TO GET TO ZERO EMISSIONS THESE ARE NOT CARS THAT ARE MEANT TO BE CHEAP DATE THAT YOU AVOID A LOT OF THE EQUITY CONCERNS- THAT HAVE. GUIDED SOME OF OUR DECISIONS WITH YOUR- IT MANDATES IN OTHER AREAS- THESE ARE GOING TO BE HIGH PRICE WHETHER THEY'RE FOR- YOU KNOW WITH- THOSE WERE TRYING TO BE FIRST EARLY ADOPTERS OR- THE RIDE SHARING MEANT TO BE CHEAP AND SO I DON'T SEE ANY GOOD REASONS WHY THEY SHOULD NOT BE ALL YOUR MISSIONS BY TWENTY THIRTY THAT'S THE TREND ALREADY WE'RE JUST GIVING IT A LITTLE PUSH. IN THE BACK HERE TO TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE NO OUT LIARS- FOR ALL THE REASONS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO REDUCE CARBON EMISSIONS RIGHT NOW WE'RE SEEING. RIGHT NOW HOW URGENT IT IS I THINK TO GET TO ZERO EMISSIONS AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE I THINK THIS IS A PROMISING TECHNOLOGY. AND AS FAR AS YOUR SECOND QUESTION YOU KNOW I ACTUALLY DUG DEEP ON THIS BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO BE SOMEBODY THAT WAS STANDING IN THE WAY OF THE TECHNOLOGY OR INNOVATION- BUT I COULD NOT HEAR A SINGLE ACTUAL. CREDIBLE EXAMPLE OF HOW THIS WAS DISRUPTING ANY KIND OF- PLANS BECAUSE MOST THESE COMPANIES ARE EITHER ON HYBRIDS OR ZERO EMISSIONS ALREADY. AND. IT'S NOT A HUGE STRETCH TO. MOVE TWO ZERO. THE TECHNOLOGY ALREADY THERE. AND CERTAINLY I WOULD HOPE THAT THE TECHNOLOGY FOR ZERO EMISSIONS VEHICLES. IN THE NEXT EIGHT YEARS WILL CONTINUE TO PROCEED- ADAM AT THE PACE HAS BEEN PROCEEDING AT OR MORE RAPIDLY. IN WHICH CASE I DON'T THINK THIS WILL BE AT ALL A STRETCH FOR THOMAS VEHICLES TO DEPLOY THEIR SOFTWARE ESSENTIALLY. ONTO THEIR MISSIONS PLATFORM. SO I DON'T KNOW IF THAT IS RESPONSIVE YOUR QUESTION VICE CHAIR. NO ABSOLUTELY I THINK I THINK THAT I THINK THAT- I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THAT SENTIMENT I THINK- I THINK. YOU AND I MAY HAVE A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE IN TERMS OF JUST. ALLOWING EMERGING TECHNOLOGY TO- TO PROCEED OR TO BE TWO TO. FOUR TO KIND OF. THRIVE AND PROSPER IN A YOU AND I DON'T KNOW I THINK WE KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IN THE NEXT. TWO TO FIVE YEARS WE'RE GONNA SEE A LOT OF ADVANCEMENTS IN THIS SPACE. THAT WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PROJECT ARE NOW. AND FROM MY PERSPECTIVE IT'S ALWAYS ONE OF THOSE- THOSE THOSE DICEY YEAH DECISIONS TO BE ABLE TO PLACE A MANDATE. OR PLACE ANY. AS RIGIDITY INTO SOMETHING THAT WE DON'T KNOW. WHAT IT'S GOING TO WHAT'S GOING TO BE ALLOWED BUT- IT'S ONLY APPRECIATE YOUR WORK I CAN'T SUPPORT THE BILL THIS TIME BUT- AND SO THEY WANT TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH YOU ON THIS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ANY OTHER MEMBERS. WELL I WILL JUST ADD TO THAT I WANT TO FIRST THANK THE SENATOR FOR WORKING ON THIS BILL FOR TAKING ON THIS VERY HEAVY VERY LARGE TOPIC AND TO MOVING INTO PUSHING THIS INDUSTRY AND IS A VERY IMPORTANT DIRECTION- TO MAKE SURE THAT- IT REALLY IS THE TYPE OF- OF VEHICLES ON THE ROAD THAT WE ALL WANT AND I WILL JUST TAKE A LITTLE ISSUE WITH WHAT MY VERY- THE STEAM TO VICE CHAIR SAID. THE EMERGING TECHNOLOGY HERE IS THE SOFTWARE AND SENSORS IT IS NOT THE ENGINE- THE ENGINE SHOULD BE AS ADVANCED AS EVERYTHING ELSE THAT'S GOING ON THESE VEHICLES AND THAT IS AB TECHNOLOGY AND THAT IS ALREADY HERE AND ALREADY BEING DEPLOYED SO THAT REALLY ISN'T A STRETCH- BUT UNLIKE A TYPICAL CAR WHICH YOU KNOW IF IT'S BOUGHT FOR PERSONAL USE IT MAKES IT IN THE GARAGE A LOT OF TIME THESE VEHICLES ARE NOT GOING TO BE THAT THEY'RE GONNA BE PURCHASED TO BE WERE COURSE VEHICLES ARE EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE. AND THEY'RE GOING TO BE RIDE SHARE VEHICLES THAT ARE GONNA BE ON THE STREET ALL THE TIME BUT THEY'RE GOING TO BE TRUCKS THAT ARE GOING TO BE ON THE STREET ALL THE TIME AND WHEN THOSE BUYERS MAKE THE INVESTMENT IN THESE VEHICLES THEY'RE GOING TO SQUEEZE EVERY YEAR AND EVERY MILE OUT OF THE VEHICLES THEY CAN'T THEY WILL FAR EXCEED. THE MILEAGE AND THE USE OF A TYPICAL PASSENGER VEHICLE AND THAT'S WHY IT'S EVEN MORE IMPORTANT THAT THE BEVS BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO BE ON OUR STREETS TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY THEY DON'T REST PLUGIN HUMAN DRIVER THEY COULD EASILY BE DRIVING TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY SO THEY MUST BE EV'S BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE A MUCH LARGER ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT THAN ANY OTHER TYPE OF VEHICLE. SO I THINK THIS IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT I WILL SAY THE ONE MOMENT THAT YOU'RE TAKING THAT I WAS SORRY TO SEE YOU TAKE WAS THE LOWERING OF THE- THE WEIGHT LIMIT- TO CAPTURE LESS OF THOSE LARGE HEAVY VEHICLES BUT I THINK THAT'S CERTAINLY A COMPROMISE THAT WE CAN ALL LIVE WITH AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE COULD REVISIT THIS INDUSTRY IS NOT SHOWING THAT THEY'RE MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND MAKING THOSE LARGER VEHICLES B. BV'S WE CAN ALWAYS COME BACK. TO THAT. NEXT YEAR THE AFTER THE AFTER THAT SO BE CERTAINLY WATCHING THAT TO SEE WHAT THE INDUSTRY DOES. BUT I'M HAPPY TO SEE EV'S. I'M SORRY BEING DEPLOYED AND I'M VERY GRATEFUL FOR YOU TO TAKING THIS ON AND I ALSO WANT TO THANK. THE OPPOSITION THAT'S NOW MOVED TO A NEUTRAL POSITION. WE APPRECIATE THEM STRETCHING FOR THIS AS WELL. I DO WE HAVE A MOTION- BUT WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR MAKING THE CASE MORE ELOQUENTLY THAN I DID WE DIDN'T WANT TO TAKE THE AMENDMENT BUT- COMPROMISE REQUIRES HARD SACRIFICES SOMETIMES. THE ONE THING I WOULD JUST- NOTE THIS IS NOT. A THIS IS TECHNOLOGY AGNOSTIC SO IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE EV'S IT ALSO CAN BE OTHER FORMS OF ZERO EMISSIONS VEHICLES. BOTH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE SORRY AND YOU'RE RIGHT I WAS USING THAT TERM INCORRECTLY WE'VE TRIED HERE I SHOULD NOT BE DOING. BUT CERTAINLY THE PRESENTS WE ALL MAKE THAT STEP- I DO WE HAVE A MOTION. AND WE HAD A SECOND OKAY THANK YOU WITH THAT LET'S TAKE RECALL. THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO COMMUNICATIONS AND CONVEYANCE FRIEDMAN. HI FRIEDMAN I PHONE. ANOTHER PHONE NO. BERMAN BERMAN I CUNNINGHAM. CUNNINGHAM NO DALY. DALY AYE DAVIES DAVIES NO GIPSON.

WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND. GRADER THANK YOU VERY MUCH ABOUT INSURANCE I DO COMMITTEE FOR WORKING WITH US IN THIS BILL. SB THREE THIRTY NINE- WILL EXTEND- THE ROAD CHARGED TECHNICAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FROM TWENTY TWENTY THREE TO TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN- THIS COMMITTEE HAS- WITH- CALIFORNIA TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION- HAS BEEN- PILOTING AND EVENTUAL TRANSITION FROM DOUBTS TAX- TO A ROAD CHARGE- IT IS. A TERRIFIC FOR CALIFORNIA IS MAKING ADVANCES ON REDUCING- THE- OR INCREASING THE EFFICIENCY OF OUR VEHICLE FLEET AND EVENTUALLY. WE ARE MOVING TO ALL ZERO- EMISSION VEHICLES IN CALIFORNIA. BUT OF COURSE WE STILL HAVE TO MAINTAIN. OUR TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE. WHICH IS CURRENTLY- PAID FOR BY GAS TAX AND SO WE HAVE TO PLAN FOR A TRANSITION WHERE WE- HOPEFULLY ARE NOT USING GAS- IN THE FUTURE- AND THIS OP PILOT PROGRAM WILL HELP US TO FORMULATE- THAT PROGRAM- THIS OUR LATEST VERSION WILL AUTHORIZE. THE PRODUCTS EXPANDS. IT'S A PURELY VOLUNTARY PROGRAM NO ONE IS REQUIRED TO PARTICIPATE IN A- TWITTER EXPAND THAT SO THE PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY PAYING. I GOT ALL VOLUNTARY SO THAT THEY CAN PILOT THAT ASPECT OF THE PROGRAM AS WELL- WE WORKED WITH A- BROAD ARRAY OF STAKEHOLDERS. THIS BILL JOINT. A LABOR BUYER MENTAL BUSINESS. CONTRA SUPPORT- AND- HAS NO RIGHT UP. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE DO HAVE ONE WITNESS REGISTERED IN SUPPORT. PAUL GONZALEZ SKI- OPERATOR IF YOU CAN PLEASE FIND. THE GENTLEMAN ON THE PHONE. YOUR LINE IS OPEN. HI GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR FRIEDMAN AND ASSEMBLY MEMBERS WITH THAT POSSIBILITY SKI DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR LEGISLATION AND FINANCE AT THE CALIFORNIA TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE CONTACT EIGHT THREE THIRTY NINE TODAY. THIS LEGISLATION ADDRESSES THE CRITICAL ISSUE WHICH IS THE FIFTEEN ABILITY OF FUNDING TO SUPPORT CALIFORNIA'S TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE. THE GAS TAX WHICH HAS LONG SERVED AS THE FOUNDATION FOR EVERYTHING THE REVENUE NEEDED TO PAY FOR OUR STATE MULTIMODAL TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM IS EXPECTED TO BE A LOT AND MUCH REVENUE AGAIN CALLED BECOME MORE FUEL EFFICIENT AND DRIVER SHIFT TO ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE. AT THE HURT CALIFORNIA'S WORKING TO PREPARE FOR THIS REVENUE IMPACT SINCE TWENTY FOURTEEN WHEN THE LEGISLATURE CREATED THE BURKE CHARGE TECHNICAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE. TO EXPLORE A NEW FINANCING SYSTEM WHERE DRIVERS WOULD PAY BY THE MILE RATHER THAN BY THE GALLON. SB THREE THIRTY NINE WOULD ALLOW THE DATE COULD BUILD UPON PREVIOUS EFFORTS BY AUTHORIZING A NEW PILOT PROGRAMS TAX REVENUE COLLECTION. THIS WOULD ENSURE THE STATE HAVE THE RIGHT PROPERTY IN PLACE FOR MINISTERING BURKE CHARGE PAYMENT WHEN THE TIME COMES FOR ACTUAL IMPLEMENTATION. THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE TRANSITION FROM A GAS TAX SERVER CHARGE WILL BE A MAJOR CHANGE FOR CALIFORNIA DRIVERS AND THE STATE NEEDS TO BE PREPARED TO MAKE SURE THE TRANSITION GOES.
