THE SURCHARGE AND WHAT THING

01:16:46.702 --> 01:16:48.904
HOW WE ARE CONSISTENT AND WHAT

01:16:48.971 --> 01:16:52.007
SURCHARGES COVER- SO CAN THE

LIKE. TWO BILLS AND ONE WHICH

01:17:04.252 --> 01:17:05.420
IS WHAT WE NEED YOU KNOW I

01:17:05.487 --> 01:17:06.822
THINK YOU ACKERMAN SAID IN YOUR

01:17:06.888 --> 01:17:09.024

COMMUNITIES NEED- BUT I REALLY

01:17:19.067 --> 01:17:20.569
STRONGLY FEEL TAT A SURCHARGE

01:17:20.635 --> 01:17:21.870
SHOULD BE USED FOR THE

THE FEDERAL LEGISLATION WITH

PROVISION IN THERE BECAUSE I

01:17:35.384 --> 01:17:36.952
THINK IT ACTUALLY RELATES TO

01:17:37.019 --> 01:17:37.552
SOMETHING THAT WAS SAID BY THE

01:17:37.619 --> 01:17:39.721

01:17:41.556 --> 01:17:42.724
ALLOWS IT DOESN'T MANDATE US TO

01:17:42.791 --> 01:17:45.027
CHARGE A FEE OBVIOUSLY- FOR THE

01:17:45.093 --> 01:17:45.861

01:18:30.505 --> 01:18:32.074
WE HAVE TO SET THAT UP WITH IT

01:18:32.140 --> 01:18:33.742
INTO A WELL AS I MENTIONED THE

01:18:33.809 --> 01:18:35.110
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL COVER

01:18:35.177 --> 01:18:36.478
85% OF THAT IS A FEDERAL

01:18:36.545 --> 01:18:38.613
MATCHING 85% SO THAT IS DOES

01:18:38.680 --> 01:18:39.815
TAKE THAT COSTS DOWN BUT IT

01:18:39.881 --> 01:18:41.516
DOES JUST PROVIDE THE SERVICES

01:18:41.583 --> 01:18:42.484
ARE ACTUALLY PROVIDED IN

01:18:42.551 --> 01:18:43.919
CONJUNCTION WITH NINETY EIGHT

01:18:43.985 --> 01:18:45.720

CABLE. EDUCATION AND- AND

01:18:59.034 --> 01:19:00.569
COMPLETE EACH DAY. WERE IN

01:19:00.635 --> 01:19:02.370
ACTIVE NEGOTIATIONS TO DRAW

01:19:02.437 --> 01:19:05.640
THOSE REALLY FINE LINE. ABOUT

01:19:05.707 --> 01:19:07.309
WHAT SHOULD BE COVERED AND WHAT

01:19:07.375 --> 01:19:09.244
NEEDS TO BE SHARED AND- YOU

01:19:09.311 --> 01:19:10.278
KNOW I THINK THOSE BRIGHT LINE

01:19:10.345 --> 01:19:12.180
CAN BE DRAWN VERY CLEARLY SO.

01:19:12.247 --> 01:19:13.815
THAT SHOULD BE COMING SHORTLY.

01:19:13.882 --> 01:19:15.750
I WILL ALSO JUST NOW BECAUSE

01:19:15.817 --> 01:19:17.786
THE COMPARISON HAS COME UP TO

01:19:17.853 --> 01:19:19.855
NINE ONE ONE. THERE IS NO

01:19:19.921 --> 01:19:21.823
REALLY CLEAR FEDERAL GUIDANCE

01:19:21.890 --> 01:19:24.025
IN HOW NINE ONE ONE SHE

01:19:24.092 --> 01:19:26.094
REVENUE. AND CALIFORNIA NATIVE

01:19:26.161 --> 01:19:28.697
BERRY AT THE FIFTH EXPOSITION.

01:19:28.763 --> 01:19:30.165
TO LIMIT THE NINE ONE ONE G.

01:19:30.232 --> 01:19:31.666
REVENUE TO BEING USED FOR

01:19:31.733 --> 01:19:33.668
TECHNOLOGY. BUT THAT'S NOT THE

01:19:33.735 --> 01:19:35.003
CASE AROUND THE COUNTRY AND

01:19:35.070 --> 01:19:36.538
CALIFORNIA IN MANY WAYS HAS.

01:19:36.605 --> 01:19:38.340
BEEN REALLY PROACTIVE IN MAKING

01:19:38.406 --> 01:19:41.009
SURE THAT YOU REVENUE. GOES TO

01:19:41.076 --> 01:19:42.310
THERAPY NINE ONE ONE. BUT EVEN

01:19:42.377 --> 01:19:43.478
HERE WE'VE MADE EXCEPTIONS

01:19:43.545 --> 01:19:45.580
REVIEWS NINE ONE ONE THREE

01:19:45.647 --> 01:19:46.848
REVENUE FOR WILDFIRE MITIGATION

01:19:46.915 --> 01:19:48.450
WHICH MEANS ENTIRELY%

01:19:48.517 --> 01:19:50.952
APPROPRIATE. AND HERE BECAUSE

01:19:51.019 --> 01:19:52.087
THERE WAS SUCH A SPECIFIC

01:19:52.154 --> 01:19:55.490
VISION FOR HOW. THE NINE EIGHT

01:19:55.557 --> 01:19:57.225
EIGHT SYSTEM WOULD BE SET UP.

01:19:57.292 --> 01:19:58.760
CONGRESS DIDN'T LEAVE IT OPEN

01:19:58.827 --> 01:19:59.895
AND IT LIKE THEY DID WITH NINE

01:19:59.961 --> 01:20:01.062
ONE ONE. THEY WERE VERY

01:20:01.129 --> 01:20:02.998
SPECIFIC ABOUT IT COVERING THE

01:20:03.064 --> 01:20:04.866
SCORE THING. THE ROUTING CALL

01:20:04.933 --> 01:20:06.968
PERSONAL MOBILECRISIS AND

01:20:07.035 --> 01:20:08.737
CRISIS. CRISIS STABILIZATION

01:20:08.803 --> 01:20:11.039
SERVICES. AND SO. WHILE THERE

01:20:11.106 --> 01:20:13.074
ARE CERTAINLY SIMILARITIES TO

01:20:13.141 --> 01:20:13.708
NINE ONE ONE THEY- ARE

01:20:13.775 --> 01:20:14.943
INCREDIBLY DISTINCT AND I

01:20:15.010 --> 01:20:16.978
THINK. WHAT WE REALLY HAVE TO

01:20:17.045 --> 01:20:18.213
FOCUS ON ATHLETES ASSEMBLY

01:20:18.280 --> 01:20:19.648
MEMBER THAT IS THAT. BOTTOM

01:20:19.714 --> 01:20:22.250
LINE THIS IS ABOUT MAKING SURE.

01:20:22.317 --> 01:20:24.085
THAT WHEN YOU PICK UP THE PHONE

01:20:24.152 --> 01:20:25.554
YOU HAVE ACCESS TO MENTAL

01:20:25.620 --> 01:20:27.289
HEALTH. SERVICES SHE WOULD

01:20:27.355 --> 01:20:28.657
NEVER CALL NINE ONE ONE WITH A

01:20:28.723 --> 01:20:30.192
HEART ATTACK AND BE TOLD THAT

01:20:30.258 --> 01:20:31.560
THERE'S NO ONE THERE TO HELP

01:20:31.626 --> 01:20:32.761
OUR CALL WITH THE FIRE IN YOUR

01:20:32.827 --> 01:20:34.196
HOUSE AND TOLD NO ONE IS THERE

01:20:34.262 --> 01:20:35.864
TO HELP. YOU THINK WE NEED TO

01:20:35.931 --> 01:20:38.099
REMEMBER. THAT IF HE IS REALLY

01:20:38.166 --> 01:20:40.335
SERVING A CRITICAL PIECE. OF

01:20:40.402 --> 01:20:50.078
THE PUZZLE IN MAKING. SURE THAT

01:20:50.145 --> 01:20:50.712
THE SIMPSONS TOGETHER. SO WITH

01:20:50.779 --> 01:20:51.813
I DO. THAT THAT IS THE PER. OF

01:20:51.880 --> 01:20:52.847
THE SPA OF THE- I WOULD SAY IS

01:20:52.914 --> 01:20:54.449
LET. THE A- THAT NINE ONE WAS

01:20:54.516 --> 01:20:56.117
NEARLY. AND I THINK IT'S ABOUT

01:20:56.184 --> 01:20:58.053
WHO BEARS THE COST FOR

01:20:58.119 --> 01:21:00.355
PROVISION OF SERVICES. AND WE

01:21:00.422 --> 01:21:02.624
