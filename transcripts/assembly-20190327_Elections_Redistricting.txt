MULLIN I WEBER [inaudible] WEBER I THAT BILLS OUT ON A FOUR TO ONE VOTE WILL BE THE ROLE OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND RESOLUTIONS THANK YOU MOVING NEXT TO ITEM NUMBER TEN ON THE AGENDA AB TEN THIRTY SIX BY SOMEONE OVER AGUIAR-CURRY. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS FIRST I WANT TO START BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS WITH THESE AMENDMENTS A. B. TEN THIRTY SIX WILL INCREASE VOTER REGISTRATION VOTING IN TWO WAYS. FIRST IT WOULD REQUIRE THE SECRETARY OF STATE TO UPDATE REGULATIONS DIRECTING COUNTY OFFICIALS TO DEVELOP. VOTER OUTREACH PROGRAMS I THINK THOSE LOCAL OFFICIALS LIKE JESSE SALINAS HERE FROM YELLOW COUNTY WHO WORKS INCREDIBLY HARD TO GET EVERYONE TO PURCHASE WHICH HAS BEEN OUR DEMOCRACY. UNFORTUNATELY MANY COUNTIES HAVE VERY LOW REGISTRATION RATES IN SOME COUNTIES CLOSE 240% OF ELIGIBLE VOTERS ARE NOT REGISTERED. THIS BILL PROVIDES TEN MILLION DOLLARS TO ENSURE THE SUCCESS OF LOCAL OUTREACH PROGRAMS WHICH A RESORT RESULT IN GREATER VOTER REGISTRATION AND PARTICIPATION. SECOND AB TEN THIRTY SIX CREATES A HIGH SCHOOL VOTER EDUCATION PILOT PROGRAM IN YELLOW COUNTY. THIS PILOT WILL STUDY MOCK ELECTIONS OF HIGH SCHOOLS CONDUCTED WITH OFFICIALS ELECTIONS EQUIPMENT LIKE VOTING MACHINES IN BALLOTS. THIS TYPE OF MARK ALEXIAN IS AFFECTED FOR TEACHING YOUNGER GENERATIONS HOW TO CAST A BALLOT SO THEY ARE EXCITED INCOMPETENT WHEN THEY GO TO THE FIRST POLL. CREATING THIS PILOT WILL LEGITIMIZE THE EFFORTS IN YOLO COUNTY AND SURE THE RESULTS OF THIS PROGRAM CAN INFORM IMPROVE MOCK ELECTION STATEWIDE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IS JESSE SALINAS REAL COUNTY. GOOD MORNING CHAIR BERMAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS JESSE SALINAS I'M DEAL A COUNTY ASSESSOR CLERK RECORDER AND REGISTER VOTERS. ON TODAY AND BEFORE YOU AS THE REGISTER VOTERS IN YOLO COUNTY AND THE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO THIS MOCK ELECTION HAPPENED IN. TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND THAT WE SHARED THE OPPORTUNITY WITH THE VERY SUPERINTENDENTS AND A SMALL SCHOOL DID THAT OUT IN THIS PART OF WHAT WE EXPERIENCE THERE WAS THAT OUR OVERALL. THERE WERE A 59% OF THE STUDENTS PARTICIPATED WHICH ACCORDING TO THE ADMINISTRATORS AT WHICH IS A REALLY HIGH NUMBER FOR PARTICIPATION IN THE LOCAL ELECTIONS. THEY HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE A BALLOT THAT WAS AN OFFICIAL LOOKING BALLOT NOW I WILL SAY THAT WE DID TWEAK IT A LITTLE BIT WE ALLOWED THEM TO PUT A TAG LINE IN THERE BECAUSE WE NEEDED TO MAKE IT A LITTLE SPECIAL FOR THESE YOUNG FOLKS SO THEY HAD. FUN WITH IT. UP AND THE BEAUTY OF IT IS WHEN YOU START TO SEE THE DATA WE BROKE IT DOWN BY CLASS THE FRESHMAN CLASS PARTICIPATED AT THE SOPHOMORE CLASS PARTICIPATED AT 59% AND WHEN YOU SAW THE JUNIORS THEY PARTICIPATED THAT THAT'S A GREAT. GREAT DATA TO BE ABLE TO START SHOWING THAT YOUNG PEOPLE NOT ONLY IF THEY GET THAT EXPERIENCE GET EXCITED ABOUT IT. THEY CAN WALK INTO AN ELECTION IN THE FUTURE AND THEY CAN ACTUALLY. HELP PROMOTED WITHIN THEIR FAMILIES TOO BECAUSE A LOT OF THESE FOLKS THOUGHT OF THESE YOUNG PEOPLE MYSELF INCLUDED. TRANSLATED FOR MY PARENTS AND MY MOM PARTICULAR AND TO BE ABLE TO BE HAVE THEM BECOME AMBASSADORS NOT ONLY FOR THEIR THEIR FELLOW STUDENTS THAT DIDN'T PARTICIPATE AND HOW EASY AND FUN IT WAS. BUT TO ACTUALLY GET THAT EXPERIENCE AND SHARE IT WITH THEIR FAMILY I CAN BE A REAL I THINK. MAJOR TRANSFORMATIONAL POINT FOR US HERE IN AND YOLO COUNTY BEYOND ONCE WE GET THIS PILOT MOVING. AWESOME THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. COMPANY DID COME ON UP TO THE MIKE AROUND THERE YOU GO AND I THINK WE'LL MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE IT SET UP. PERFECT PLEASE GO AHEAD.

UPDATING THE REGULATIONS AND REQUIRING VOTER EDUCATION AND OUTREACH PLANTS TO BE UPDATED PERIODICALLY WILL HELP INSURE ALL COUNTY VOTER EDUCATION AND NOT REACH PLANS. ARE REFLECTIVE OF OUR CURRENT VOTER REGISTRATION POLICIES AND THAT RESOURCES ARE ADJUSTED ACCORDINGLY WITH THE AMENDMENTS OUTLINED IN THE ANALYSIS AND THE EACH WEEK TO THE FINDINGS INTEGRATIONS I'M RECOMMENDING SUPPORT. OF THE BILL MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED AND RE REFER TO APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE BERMAN. BERMAN AYE AYE GALLAGHER. GALLAGHER NO MARK STONE. WHAT STONE I LOW [inaudible] MAYES. MAYES NOT VOTING. MULLIN. MULLIN AYE WEBER. WEBER I THAT BILL AS IT'S OUT ON THE FORTY ONE VOTE WILL KEEP THE ROLE ABSENT -- FOR WILL KEEP THE ROLE OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS -- THANK YOU FOR WORKING WITH ME THANK YOU PLEASURE -- AND WITH THAT I SEE SOME A MEMBER GONZALEZ IN THE CROWD. IF YOU LIKE TO PRESENT AT A NUMBER TO AB. THREE SIXTY THREE THE MORNING GOOD MORNING IN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS SAID LIKE. TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS AND THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR HARD WORK ON THIS BILL. ASSEMBLY BILL THREE SIXTY THREE WOULD PROVIDE ALL VOTERS WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE EARLY INCONVENIENTLY AT LOCATION IN THEIR OWN COMMUNITY BEFORE AN ELECTION. ELECTION DAY THE UNITED STATES WAS ORIGINALLY ESTABLISHED ON A TUESDAY IN ORDER TO RELATIVELY -- TO BE RELATIVELY CONVENIENT FOR FARMERS TO TRAVEL DAY AFTER THE SABBATH TO APPOINT PLACE IN RETURN IN TIME TO MARKET TO OPEN ON WEDNESDAY. TODAY'S WORK WEEK HOWEVER IS FAST PACED AND LESS PREDICTABLE WHICH IN TURN CREATES AN OBSTACLE FOR CALIFORNIANS TO EXERCISE THEIR RIGHT TO VOTE DURING A THIRTEEN HOUR PERIOD IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WEEK. A PEW RESEARCH CENTER STUDY OF THE TWENTY SIXTEEN ELECTION FOUND THAT WHEN THE TOP REASON CITED BY NON VOTERS WAS THAT THEY WERE TOO BUSY OR HAD A CONFLICTING SCHEDULE. PEOPLE ARE OFTEN UNABLE TO CAST A BALLOT ON TUESDAY BECAUSE THEY CAN'T GET TIME OFF WORK OR DON'T HAVE CHILDCARE. FOR CALIFORNIA COUNTIES OPTING TO CONDUCT ELECTIONS UNDER THE VOTERS CHOICE ACT VOTERS ARE ALREADY GIVEN THE OPTION TO VOTE EARLY AT A VOTE CENTER IN THEIR COMMUNITY. HOWEVER ONLY FIVE COUNTIES I THINK THAT'S GROWING OUT OF FOURTEEN ELIGIBLE COUNTIES CONDUCTED ELECTIONS WITHIN THIS MODEL IN. TWENTY EIGHTEEN SEVERAL CALIFORNIA COUNTIES NOT CONDUCTING VOTERS CHOICE ACT ELECTIONS ALSO ALREADY OFFER SOME LEVEL WE CAN VOTING EARLY VOTING BUT THESE OPTIONS FOR EARLY VOTINGMY ONLY BE BASIC REGISTRAR OF VOTERS OFFICE. WHICH CAN BE DEFAULT CALL TO ACCESS OR MAY HAVE CONSTRAINING HOURS OF OPERATION FOR EXAMPLE IN MY COMMUNITY THERE IS WEEKEND VOTING AT THE REGISTER VOTERS BUT IF YOU I DON'T HAVE A CAR IT WOULD TAKE YOU OVER AN HOUR TO GET FROM. MY COMMUNITY TO THE RED STAR. VOTING IS THE CENTRAL COMPONENT DEMOCRACY AND IT'S CLOSE TO FULL PARTICIPATION AS POSSIBLE THE CANDIDATES ELECTED IN DECISIONS BEING MADE ARE NEVER GOING TO TRULY REFLECT THE NEEDS ONCE AND BACKGROUNDS OF REGULAR CALIFORNIANS. THERE'S STILL A LONG WAY TO GO. AB THREE SIXTY THREE WHAT EXPAND ACCESS TO THE BALLOT BOX FOR CALIFORNIANS BY PROVIDING VOTERS AN OPTION TO VOTE IN PERSON AT A LOCATION WITHIN THEIR COMMUNITY DURING THE SATURDAY SUNDAY OR MONDAY LEADING UP TO THE ELECTION. AB THREE SIXTY THREE WOULD REQUIRE COUNTIES TO RIDE LOCATIONS FOR EARLY VOTING AT A RATE OF ONE SATELLITE VOTING LOCATION PER TEN THOUSAND REGISTERED VOTERS. OPEN FOR A MINIMUM OF EIGHT HOURS A DAY. FOR SPECIAL ELECTIONS -- BASED ON THE AMENDMENTS RATIO WOULD BE ONE LOCATION PER THIRTY THOUSAND LETTERS THIS WOULD NOT APPLY TO THE COUNTLESS -- THE COUNTY'S OPTING TO CONDUCT ELECTIONS PURSUANT TO THE VOTERS CHOICE FACT BECAUSE THAT OF COURSE THERE ARE YOU PROVIDING -- WHICH I HAVE A WITNESS TODAY TO TEST BY SUPPORT FROM COMING COST. THANK YOU CHAIR MEMBERS NICKEL SIDE ON WITH COMMON CAUSE. WERE A STRONGLY IN SUPPORT OF AB THREE SIX THREE TO PROVIDE EARLY VOTING OPPORTUNITIES INCLUDING ON WEEKENDS IN ALL CALIFORNIA COUNTIES. ALTHOUGH CALIFORNIA'S MADE GREAT STRIDES IN MAKING VOTING IS HERE WE KNOW THAT THE TIMING OF OUR ELECTIONS REMAINS BEAR TO FULL PARTICIPATION IN OUR ELECTIONS. IN FACT ACCORDING TO TWENTY FOURTEEN PP I SEE POLL WHEN THE TOP REASONS CALIFORNIA REGISTERED VOTERS GIVE FOR NOT VOTING HIS COAT TIME OR SCHEDULE CONSTRAINTS. PUTTING CALIFORNIA'S WILL KNOW CURSE ON A WEEK DAY WE SHOULDN'T LET THE TIMING OF OUR ELECTIONS BE A BARRIER TO VOTING FOR PEOPLE WORK LONG HOURS WERE A CHILD CARE LIMITATIONS WERE OTHER CHALLENGES KEEPING THEM FROM THE POLLS. EARLY VOTING AND PARTICULARLY WEEKEND BOATING PROVIDES GREATER FLEXIBILITY INSULAR VOTING SYSTEM CAN MATCH THE NEEDS OF OUR VOTERS. AND WE KNOW THAT EARLY VOTING WORKS THE TWENTY FIFTEEN STUDY IN THE ELECTION LAW JOURNAL FOUND THE PROVIDING EARLY VOTING CITES. A RATIO IS VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT IS PROVIDED IN THIS BILL. LEAD TO SEVERAL PERCENTAGE POINT INCREASES IN TURNOUT. EARLY VOTING ALSO MAKES FOR BETTER VOTING EXPERIENCE. IN SACRAMENTO WHICH IS VCA COUNTY 15% OF IN PERSON VOTERS VOTED EARLY MOST IN THE THREE DAYS LEADING UP TO THE ELECTION. WITH COMPLAINTS WE HEARD ACROSS THE STATE ABOUT LONG LINES POINT PLACES I SUSPECT THAT THE DEMAND FOR EARLY VOTING WILL BE EVEN HIGHER IN THE FUTURE. FOR ALL THESE REASONS WERE PROUD STRONG SUPPORT. EIGHTY THREE SIX THREE THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES AND SUPPORT. TOMORROW'S THE ROOM VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA IN STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. MY ANGER ACLU OF CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING TERRY MEMBERS MELISSA ROMERO ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LEAGUE OF CONSERVATION VOTERS AND STRONG SUPPORT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE BRING BACK. TO SING ONE COME ON UP. NOT DIG ORDERED OR TWEENER MAYBE YEAH YES WE ARE DATING SELENA CALIFORNIA CITIES -- NOT OPPOSE THE BILL I CERTAINLY GET THE INTENT ONE I WANT TO TRY TO TRY TO WORK WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE AND WORKING WITH HER -- STAFF RIGHT NOW THE THE BUT WE'RE LOOKING FOR SPECIFICALLY IS THAT -- WE UNDERSTAND THAT IS A PART OF VOTERS CHOICE ACT ALSO WANT TO HAVE SOME CONSIDERATION WITH REGARDS -- TO CITIES WHO ARE CONSOLIDATING THEIR ELECTIONS WITH THE COUNTY -- UNDRESSED BEFORE FIFTEEN THE WAY SO BILL COUPLE YEARS AGO -- WE'RE SEEING MORE MORE ELECTION CONSOLIDATIONS AND SO THE COUNTIES ARE THE ONES WHO WOULD MAKE A WHO ARE ADMINISTERING THE ELECTIONS HOWEVER -- I UNDERSTAND SHOOT CITY CLERKS ARE STILL ELECTED ARE STILL CONSIDER LOCAL ELECTIONS OFFICIALS AND SO WE'RE JUST TRYING TO FIND SOME CLARITY AS TO THE APPLICABILITY OF WOULD THIS BE AN ADDITIONAL DUTY -- WITH OUR ON CITY CLERKS TO ESTABLISH SATELLITE LOCATIONS ALTHOUGH THE COUNTY I IS THE WANTED MEASURE THE ELECTION AND SO -- THE AUTHORS OFFICES BEEN GREAT TO WORK WITH SO FAR BUT LOOKING FOR TO CONTINUE WORKING CALPERS OFFICE ME BOARD THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SEE NO ADDITIONAL COMMENTS BRING BETTER COLLEAGUES FOR QUESTIONS COMMENTS MOTIONS MULLIN. A MOTION A SECOND JUST APPLY THE ASSEMBLY WOMAN FOR BRINGING THE BILL AND PLEASE ADD ME AS A CO AUTHOR WHEN. THE NEXT OPPORTUNITY THANK YOU. ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS COMMENTS THIS ROSTER YEAH I MEAN I'M A LITTLE BIT TORN ON IT BECAUSE I KIND OF SEE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO AND AND I YOU KNOW. BODY MORE ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES. TO VOTE. BUT YOU KNOW IT ONLY APPLIES THE TRADITIONAL PRECINCT POLLING -- PLACES AND AND PRINT FOR INSTANCE I LOOK IT. THE SPECIAL ELECTION IT JUST HAPPENED YESTERDAY I DON'T THINK ANY OF OUR COUNTIES OF NORTH ARE ARE ALL BILL BY MAIL -- COUNTIES IN YEAH WE HAD A VERY MUCH HIGHER TURN OUT THEN THE OTHER SPECIAL ELECTION -- DOWN IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WHERE THEY DO RIGHT SO I DON'T SEE THAT THIS IS A REALLY AN IMPEDIMENT TO PEOPLE TURNING OUT TO VOTE -- YOU KNOW PEOPLE. AND NOW WE HAVE SAME DAY VOTER REGISTERED RED REGISTRATION WE HAVE -- YOU KNOW AUTOMATIC VOTER REGISTRATION VOTER REGISTRATION RIGHT BECAUSE YOUR BILL -- SO THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT. WAYS THAT PEOPLE HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE PEOPLE CAN SIGN ANYBODY CAN SIGN UP TO BE ABSENTEE VOTE BY MAIL -- SO THIS DOES PUT A LOT OF COST ON THOSE TRADITIONAL ON THIS COUNTIES THAT ARE DOING THE TRADITIONAL POLLING PLACES TO NOW. HAVE THAT OPEN FOR THE WHOLE WEEKEND AND HAVE WORKERS THERE IT'S AND THEY'RE ALREADY. MANY OF THESE COUNTIES ARE PRETTY RURAL AND DON'T HAVE A LOT OF RESOURCES TO TO BEGIN WITH SO THAT'S MY ONE OF MY KIND OF LARGER CONCERNS ON AND OF COURSE -- THEY COULD REDUCE COSTS BY SIMPLY SWITCHING TO OF THE CA COUNTY I MEAN NOT THAT ONE OF THINGS WE WANT TO DO IS LINE UP -- NOW THEY ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITY THAT FOLKS WHO LIVE IN A VOTER CHOICE ACT COUNTY HAVE. RIGHT SO -- I UNDERSTAND IN SEVEN THINGS YOU BROUGHT UP I'M NOT SURE THEY'RE THEY'RE THE SAME TYPE OF OPPORTUNITY AS THIS SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT -- SAME DATE CONDITIONAL REGISTRATION I YOU HAVE TO ACTUALLY GO TO THE REGISTRAR OF VOTERS OFFICE SO AGAIN ON ELECTION DAY -- I MEAN THAT THAT IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY FOR EXAMPLE YOU WOULD HAVE IT FOR MY COMMUNITY TAKEN ABOUT SORT OF TAKING OVER AN HOUR TO GET THERE YOU WERE STOOD IN LINE WITH. FIVE HUNDRED OTHER PEOPLE -- I'M NOT SURE WHO CAN TAKE THAT KIND OF TIME OFF ON A TUESDAY. TO VOTE THERE WERE PLENTY PEOPLE WHO COULD BUT THEY'RE PROBABLY NOT WORKING FOLKS AND AND AND THAT WORKING CLASS COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE AND SO THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS WERE REALLY TRYING TO GET AT IS HOW DO WE TAKE AWAY ANY BARRIERS TO VOTING. I UNDERSTAND YES PEOPLE CAN -- ASK FOR AND GET A AN ABSENTEE BALLOT -- AND WE'VE DONE A LOT TO HELP. SOLVE THAT WE YOU KNOW IT'S GONNA BE POSTAGE PAID THEIR THERE'S ALL WHAT WERE ADVANCING A LOT OF WAYS BUT THERE ARE STILL SOME PEOPLE WHO ARE RESISTANT TO DOING THAT THEY WANT TO VOTE IN PERSON AND THEY THEY WANT THAT OPPORTUNITY OR THEY DON'T KNOW. YET HOW TO TO REQUEST AN ABSENTEE BALLOT SO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS ADD NUMBER ONE EQUITY THROUGHOUT THE STATE SO WHEN WE HAVE A GENERAL ELECTION THE PEOPLE IN SAN DIEGO WHO DON'T YET HAVE THE CA EVEN THOUGH WE'RE TRYING -- HAVE THOSE OPPORTUNITIES THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES AS PEOPLE HAVE MISTER MULLINS DISTRICT -- WHO DIDN'T WAY FAR OUT THERE ON THIS RIGHT -- AND THAT WE HAVE SOME EQUITY STATEWIDE AND I I THINK EVEN THE RURAL COUNTIES THAT THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF FOLKS WHO WOULD APPRECIATE THAT TYPE OF EXTRA TIME. AND AND ABILITY TO VOTE IN PERSON -- ON THE WEEKEND BEFORE THE ELECTION. IS IT IS THE GOAL HERE TO TO TRY TO GET EVERYBODY TO TO GO TO ALL MAIL BALLOT I ACTUALLY BUT I SUPPORT IT I THINK WE SHOULD I THINK -- I'VE BEEN BEEN VOTING -- BERMAN ABSENTEE -- WE TALKED ABOUT THIS THE OTHER DAY -- SINCE I WAS IN MY EARLY TWENTIES I THINK IT'S FANTASTIC -- BUT TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT TAKE YOU GET THE TIME THE BILL TO GO TO THE BALLOT STUDY READ -- KNOW WHAT YOU'RE AYE YOU'RE GOING TO VOTE I'M IS THAT THE GOAL WITH THIS UP WITH WITH THIS BILL. NOW I THINK THE GOAL IS THAT THE FACT I MEAN IT. IN A WAY WHERE WERE OUT. I THINK YOU'RE ASKING A DIFFERENT QUESTION IS MY GOAL. TO TO INSURE THE MORE CALORIES GO TO VOTER CHOICE ACT MODEL. YES THAT'S DIFFERENT THAN ASKING A RECORD OF VOTE BY MAIL BECAUSE VOTER CHOICE ACT MODEL THE THING THAT'S SO WONDERFUL ABOUT IT IS IT HAS THESE VOTE CENTERS IN THE ABILITY FOR AN INDIVIDUAL -- WHO YOU KNOW FROM THAT HAS LANGUAGE ACCESS PROBLEMS MAYBE THAT HAS HAS NEVER VOTED BEFORE AN IS CONFUSED -- MAYBE SOMEBODY WHO IS DISABLED I CAN GO TO TO A VOTE CENTER AND IT CAN HELP THEM CAST THEIR BALLOTS IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE BY MAIL ONLY SO I'M NOT. I'M NOT IN OF SUPPORT OF OF MALE ONLY PROVIDING THAT IS THE ONLY OPPORTUNITY THIS IS AN ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITY TO I THINK IT'S A BETTER MODEL FOR FOR COUNTIES TO GO TOWARDS OF COURSE IT'S CHEAPER -- IT PROVIDES THE THE FACT THAT A BALLOT GETS IN EVERY SINGLE VOTERS HANDED BEFORE THE ELECTION I THINK THAT THAT'S AT A POSITIVE YOU KNOW ATTRIBUTE TO IT THAT WE ACTUALLY ARE. ARE TAKING AWAY PRETTY MUCH ANY BARRIER TO VOTING AND I THINK THAT THE VOTER CHOICE ACT MODEL HELPS DO THAT -- BUT IN THOSE COUNTIES WERE RESISTANT TO CHANGING TOWARD VAN I UNDERSTAND THAT TOO WE SHOULDN'T PUT INDIVIDUALS ADS -- BECAUSE THE INDIVIDUAL COURSE VOTER DOESN'T HAVE AT AT A REAL STRONG -- VOICE IN THAT OPTION RIGHT IT'S COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS -- THE I GUESS THEY CAN TALK TO THE COUNTY BOARD SUPERVISOR BUT THEY'RE NOT REALLY HAVING THEY THEY COULD STILL BE DENIED THE OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE EARLY AS A RESULT OF THAT THE FACT THAT THERE COUNTY DIDN'T GO THAT OPTION. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO TAKE AWAY THAT DISPARITY. HIS ROSTER. REAL QUICKLY IS IT AND I GUESS THAT'S ONE OF MY THAT'S MY CONCERN IS LIKE A LOT OF US DO OUT HAVE THE TRADITIONAL MODEL. AND ACTION YOU KNOW I MEAN THIS IS OBVIOUSLY MY EXPERIENCE YOUR EXPERIENCES SAN DIEGO'S DIFFERENT BUT WE HAVE REALLY HIGH TURN OUT RIGHT I MEAN ARE PEOPLE TURN OUT TO VOTE WE HAVE SOME OF THE HIGHEST VOTE RATES. IN THE STATE. AND IT WORKS FOR US AND THEM. WE LIKE HAVING THAT POLLING PLACE LOCATION RIGHT SO IT'S KIND OF LIKE. THIS SEEMS TO PUT MORE COST ON THOSE PEOPLE FOR FOR CHOOSING. T. TO ADOPT THAT MORE TRADITIONAL MODEL WE STILL HAVE THE ABILITY FOR PEOPLE YOU ABSENTEE TO DO VOTE BY MAIL -- BUT WE HAVE THE TRADITIONAL POLLING PLACES IF WE HAD TO PROVIDE. NO THESE THROUGHOUT THAT WEEKEND IT'S IN A IT'S A PRETTY LARGE ADDITIONAL COST TO THESE COUNTIES WHO. WHO ARGUABLY ARE DOING A LOT BETTER AT TURNING OUT VOTERS THAN OTHER PLACES THAT? MAYBE HAVE A DOT EVEN EVEN PLACES THAT HAVE ADOPTED VOTER CHOICE ACT -- WITH ALL DUE RESPECT [inaudible] THE I'M I'M. GOING TO WATCHTHE WAY SAY THIS TO TRY TO BE AS RESPECTFUL AS POSSIBLE. I'M VOTER TURNOUT IS TIED OFTEN TO SOCIO ECONOMIC CLASS. RACE OPPORTUNITY AND SO ALTHOUGH YOUR DISTRICT OUR WATER POOR PEOPLE TO OF I ITEMS AGAIN GRAPHICS I I I DO UNDERSTAND YOU DO HAVE A LOT OF POOR PEOPLE WOULD BE GREAT TO SEE A AN OVERLAY OF VOTER TURN OUT AND AND VOTER TURNOUT AMONG YOUR POOR. AND WORKING CLASS FOLKS AND PEOPLE OF COLOR I I'M GONNA GUESS THAT THERE'S A DISPARITY THERE BECAUSE TRADITIONALLY THERE'S A DISPARITY EVERYWHERE WITHOUT SO I UNDERSTAND -- THAT THERE ARE SOME FOLKS DOING VERY WELL UNDER THE MODEL THAT YOU HAVE BUT I WOULD GUESS IT THAT I COULD GO TO YOUR DISTRICT AND FIND A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE DOING VERY WELL UNDER THAT MODEL. AND AS FAR AS COST IS CONCERNED IT IS IT VOTING COST RIGHT RUNNING A DEMOCRACY COST MONEY BUT I'D ALSO ARGUE THAT OUR OUR OUR PRIMARY FUNCTION IS THE GOVERNMENT IS TO MAKE DEMOCRACY WORK THAT IS THE THE OVER ARCHING -- IMPORTANT FEATURE THAT WE HAVE IS A DEMOCRACY IN THAT WE HAVE TO INVEST IN ORDER TO MAKE THAT WORK WE HAVE TO ENGAGE OUR CITIZENS MARIE AND ALLOW THEM OPPORTUNITIES TO ENGAGE. WE WILL ALL BE BETTER FOR IT I THINK THAT -- YOU WOULD SEE A A DIFFERENT -- NOW MODEL IN IN YOUR IN YOUR DISTRICT IF YOU PROVIDED THESE TYPES OF OPPORTUNITIES AND THAT THAT MAY NOT. BE WHAT SOME PEOPLE WHAT I I THINK IT'S ULTIMATELY VERY A VERY POSITIVE THING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF THAT RESPECTFUL ENOUGH. ALL RIGHT I'LL BRING YOU SOME NUMBERS THAT'S AS THE VALUE DEMOCRACY IS WE RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE WITH EACH OTHER. ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS [inaudible] SEEING NONE. WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. I THINK -- AT THE END OF THE DAY THIS IS ABOUT EQUITY AND WHEN I THINK ABOUT COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE AND SOME OTHERS WHERE THE COUNTY AS MAY BE THINKING ABOUT GOING THIS DIRECTION I IN PROVIDING THIS OPPORTUNITY BUT HAVEN'T YET -- THAT WE WE SHOULD PUSH THEM ALONG TIE IT TO TO ENSURE THAT EVERYBODY HAS THE RIGHT IN THEIR COMMUNITY TO VOTE ON A SATURDAY OR SUNDAY -- WHEN OFTEN AT OUR MONDAY BEFORE THE ELECTION WHEN OFTEN THAT HAVE -- THE ABILITY TO DEAL WITH THINGS LIKE CHILD CARE AS THE HOPEFULLY ON WHEN THOSE DAYS THEY'RE NOT WORKING -- FOR THE FULL THIRTEEN HOURS AND AND ADD THE ABILITY TO GET SOME MORE THAT'S CONVENIENT AND CLOSE BY -- I I THINK IT'S A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT THAT WE SHOULD HAVE THIS CALIFORNIANS IN WHEN WE REALIZE AS WE PUT THESE OPTIONAL -- THESE OPTIONAL OPPORTUNITIES INTO LAW LIKE WE HAVE AN RVCA AYE AYE THAT'S A GREAT THING BUT IT ALSO MEANS THAT WE HAVE A DISPARITY OF OPPORTUNITY DEPENDING ON THE COUNTY YOU LIVE AND THAT'S WERE TRYING TO RAISE SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK MY ABOUT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I APPRECIATE THE OTHER WORKING AMENDMENTS TO THIS PROVIDER BILL WILL MANY COUNTIES NOT CONDUCTING RESTORE SEXUAL ACTIONS ARE ALREADY OFFERING SOME LEVEL OF EARLY VOTING.
