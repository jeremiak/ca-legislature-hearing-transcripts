HIS BODY. AND WE COMMUNITY

00:38:34.546 --> 00:38:38.283 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE COMPLETELY.

00:38:35.947 --> 00:38:40.852 region:rollup2
AND WRITING. AND I JUST WANTED

00:38:38.283 --> 00:38:41.986 region:rollup2
TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I TO HAVE NO

00:38:40.852 --> 00:38:43.988 region:rollup2
CLUE WHETHER NOT THESE PEOPLE

00:38:41.986 --> 00:38:45.323 region:rollup2

00:38:43.988 --> 00:38:46.224 region:rollup2
THAT THE OPTION IS THERE AND

00:38:45.323 --> 00:38:49.527 region:rollup2
THAT THERE'S SOMEONE ON THE

00:38:46.224 --> 00:38:52.063 region:rollup2
OTHER END WITH SKILLS.

00:38:49.527 --> 00:38:53.798 region:rollup2
HAS AYE I CAN'T EVEN DESCRIBE

00:38:52.063 --> 00:38:55.433 region:rollup2
THE IMPORTANCE OF THAT

00:38:53.798 --> 00:38:57.836 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE FOR THE FOR THE

00:38:55.433 --> 00:39:00.672 region:rollup2
HUMANS ON AND THEIR FAMILIES

00:38:57.836 --> 00:39:02.574 region:rollup2
THAT WE CARE FOR IN OUR OFFICE.

00:39:00.672 --> 00:39:04.442 region:rollup2
THREE OF THOSE OF THE THREE OF

00:39:02.574 --> 00:39:07.111 region:rollup2
THOSE TO WERE DENIED.

00:39:04.442 --> 00:39:08.613 region:rollup2
BY THEIR CURRENT PHYSICIANS FOR

00:39:07.111 --> 00:39:09.948 region:rollup2
THE MOST RECENT PISSED BECAUSE

00:39:08.613 --> 00:39:10.982 region:rollup2
PEOPLE ARE UNCOMFORTABLE AND

00:39:09.948 --> 00:39:12.317 region:rollup2
HESITANT NOT BECAUSE THEY'RE

00:39:10.982 --> 00:39:13.651 region:rollup2
OPPOSED

00:39:12.317 --> 00:39:15.887 region:rollup2
SO IT'S THAT ALONG WITH THE

00:39:13.651 --> 00:39:17.689 region:rollup2
ACCESS ISSUE HESITANCY IS THE

00:39:15.887 --> 00:39:19.591 region:rollup2
SECOND BIGGEST ISSUE THAT I SEE

00:39:17.689 --> 00:39:21.025 region:rollup2
AN IMPLEMENTATION.

00:39:19.591 --> 00:39:22.927 region:rollup2
ARE AND FOR THAT REASON I'M

00:39:21.025 --> 00:39:24.462 region:rollup2
CONTINUING MY OUT REACH TO DO

00:39:22.927 --> 00:39:26.331 region:rollup2
TRAININGS AT THE CALIFORNIA

00:39:24.462 --> 00:39:28.800 region:rollup2
ACADEMY OF FAMILY PHYSICIANS.

00:39:26.331 --> 00:39:29.367 region:rollup2
CLINICAL FOREMAN MONTEREY THIS

00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:32.070 region:rollup2
YEAR FOR THE FIRST TIME AND

00:39:29.367 --> 00:39:33.304 region:rollup2
MONEY. ASSEMBLY LIKE THAT.

00:39:32.070 --> 00:39:35.440 region:rollup2
I WOULD LIKE TO SESSIONS ARE

00:39:33.304 --> 00:39:37.876 region:rollup2
OPEN TO IT UP VERY OPEN.

00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:40.278 region:rollup2
VERY OPEN BUT IT'S NEW AND FOR

00:39:37.876 --> 00:39:42.380 region:rollup2
THAT REASON BEING ABLE TO.

00:39:40.278 --> 00:39:43.648 region:rollup2
FIND OUT WHO ELSE IS PRESCRIBING

00:39:42.380 --> 00:39:46.050 region:rollup2
WHAT DO THEY PRESCRIBE WHAT DO

00:39:43.648 --> 00:39:47.952 region:rollup2
YOU DO IF SOMETHING. IS LESS IT

00:39:46.050 --> 00:39:49.487 region:rollup2
ISN'T EXPECTED ETCETERA SO THOSE

00:39:47.952 --> 00:39:51.890 region:rollup2
ARE THE TWO BIG THINGS THAT I

00:39:49.487 --> 00:39:54.325 region:rollup2
SEE IS AS AS OUR ISSUES RIGHT

00:39:51.890 --> 00:39:56.561 region:rollup2
NOW. ACCESS FINDING SOMEONE WHO

00:39:54.325 --> 00:39:58.963 region:rollup2
WILL PRESCRIBE CAN PRESCRIBE

00:39:56.561 --> 00:40:00.498 region:rollup2
THAT HAS THE ABILITY TO FIND

00:39:58.963 --> 00:40:01.532 region:rollup2
RESOURCES TO HELP THEM DO SO

00:40:00.498 --> 00:40:03.635 region:rollup2
BRILLIANTLY AND.

00:40:01.532 --> 00:40:06.004 region:rollup2
COMPASSIONATELY AND THEN.

00:40:03.635 --> 00:40:08.072 region:rollup2
THE SECOND IS ACTUALLY THAT

00:40:06.004 --> 00:40:10.708 region:rollup2
VENUE WHO WHO ARE THOSE PEOPLE

00:40:08.072 --> 00:40:12.477 region:rollup2
HOW HOW DID WE DO THAT ACCESS

00:40:10.708 --> 00:40:15.914 region:rollup2
AND INFORMATION.

00:40:12.477 --> 00:40:18.116 region:rollup2
QUESTION.

THE ACCESS ISSUE.

00:40:37.669 --> 00:40:41.906 region:rollup2
.

00:40:39.637 --> 00:40:43.441 region:rollup2
MY GUESS IS.

00:40:41.906 --> 00:40:45.143 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WHO KNOW OF YOUR WORK

00:40:43.441 --> 00:40:46.678 region:rollup2

PATIENTS YOUR DIRECTION.

00:40:46.678 --> 00:40:50.048 region:rollup2
BUT.

00:40:48.513 --> 00:40:52.784 region:rollup2
WHAT IF THAT'S A PATIENT IN SAN

00:40:50.048 --> 00:40:54.852 region:rollup2
DIEGO COUNTY IMPERIAL COUNTY? DO

00:40:52.784 --> 00:40:56.087 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE ANY RESOURCES ARE AT

00:40:54.852 --> 00:40:57.822 region:rollup2
YOUR FINGERTIPS TO KNOW WHAT

00:40:56.087 --> 00:40:59.290 region:rollup2
OTHER PHYSICIANS AND OTHER PARTS

00:40:57.822 --> 00:41:02.660 region:rollup2
OF THE STATE.

00:40:59.290 --> 00:41:04.329 region:rollup2
MAY BE. A PROVIDING SUPPORT YOU

00:41:02.660 --> 00:41:05.530 region:rollup2
ASKED A GREAT QUESTION AND THE

00:41:04.329 --> 00:41:07.565 region:rollup2
SHORT ANSWER IS THAT THERE'S

00:41:05.530 --> 00:41:09.801 region:rollup2
NOTHING FORMAL NOW IT'S ALL BY

00:41:07.565 --> 00:41:11.602 region:rollup2
INFORMAL NETWORKS. WHICH MEANS

00:41:09.801 --> 00:41:13.638 region:rollup2
THAT PEOPLE WHO HAVE GOOD SKILLS

00:41:11.602 --> 00:41:15.974 region:rollup2
FOR ACCESSING NETWORKS ENGLISH

00:41:13.638 --> 00:41:17.575 region:rollup2
LANGUAGE FOR INSTANCE ARM HAVE

00:41:15.974 --> 00:41:18.776 region:rollup2
GOOD ACCESS AND THOSE THAT DON'T

00:41:17.575 --> 00:41:20.812 region:rollup2
MIGHT NOT.

00:41:18.776 --> 00:41:23.214 region:rollup2
IT THERE IS ONE OF THE OTHER

00:41:20.812 --> 00:41:24.682 region:rollup2
THINGS IS THAT BECAUSE OF THAT

00:41:23.214 --> 00:41:26.951 region:rollup2
STATE FUNDING VERSUS THE FEDERAL

00:41:24.682 --> 00:41:29.220 region:rollup2
FUNDING ISSUE PEOPLE THAT ARE IN

00:41:26.951 --> 00:41:30.788 region:rollup2
FEDERALLY FUNDED CENTERS ARE.

00:41:29.220 --> 00:41:32.423 region:rollup2
HAVING TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT

00:41:30.788 --> 00:41:33.992 region:rollup2
HOW TO PROCEED AND IT'S NOT IN

00:41:32.423 --> 00:41:35.326 region:rollup2
NOT DIFFERENT OTHER THINGS WHERE

00:41:33.992 --> 00:41:37.995 region:rollup2
THERE'S FEDERAL BANDS.

00:41:35.326 --> 00:41:40.298 region:rollup2
BUT IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE IT

00:41:37.995 --> 00:41:42.600 region:rollup2
IT'S CHALLENGING AND I KNOW OF

00:41:40.298 --> 00:41:44.102 region:rollup2
I'VE GOT TO SPEAK TO NOW FOR

00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:46.404 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT COUNTIES ARE HEALTH

00:41:44.102 --> 00:41:48.139 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS ABOUT WHAT THEY MIGHT DO

00:41:46.404 --> 00:41:50.508 region:rollup2
HOPE THEY CAN NAVIGATE THAT BUT

00:41:48.139 --> 00:41:51.776 region:rollup2
IT IS AN ISSUE. WHICH IS IF YOU

00:41:50.508 --> 00:41:52.310 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE MEANS IF YOU DON'T

00:41:51.776 --> 00:41:55.413 region:rollup2
HAVE LANGUAGE HOW CAN YOU

00:41:52.310 --> 00:41:56.681 region:rollup2
ACCESS.

00:41:55.413 --> 00:41:57.815 region:rollup2
IN THE END EQUITABLE WAY PEOPLE

00:41:56.681 --> 00:41:58.383 region:rollup2
ARE ALWAYS WORRIED THE OTHER WAY

00:41:57.815 --> 00:41:59.784 region:rollup2
ABOUT.

00:41:58.383 --> 00:42:01.586 region:rollup2
VULNERABLE POPULATIONS I

00:41:59.784 --> 00:42:03.087 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY THINK.

00:42:01.586 --> 00:42:04.856 region:rollup2
THE WAY THAT WE'VE RULED OUT

00:42:03.087 --> 00:42:05.890 region:rollup2
WITH WITH THUMB WITHOUT THE

00:42:04.856 --> 00:42:07.959 region:rollup2

00:42:05.890 --> 00:42:09.427 region:rollup2

00:42:07.959 --> 00:42:11.396 region:rollup2
GIVE THEM AROUND FUNDING.

00:42:09.427 --> 00:42:13.431 region:rollup2

00:42:11.396 --> 00:42:16.200 region:rollup2
THAT PRIVILEGED IN OUR STATE

00:42:13.431 --> 00:42:18.236 region:rollup2
BETTER NOW THAN THEN AT A MORE

00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:19.871 region:rollup2
EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION WON'T

00:42:18.236 --> 00:42:21.506 region:rollup2
THANK YOU FOR THAT I THINK.

00:42:19.871 --> 00:42:24.242 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT IS IN ITS EARLY

00:42:21.506 --> 00:42:25.143 region:rollup2
STAGES OF IMPLEMENTATION.

00:42:24.242 --> 00:42:26.844 region:rollup2
THE THINGS WE LEARN NOW CAN HELP

00:42:25.143 --> 00:42:28.312 region:rollup2
US.

MOVE FORWARD IN MAYBE NOT

00:42:28.312 --> 00:42:32.050 region:rollup2

00:52:17.267 --> 00:52:20.137 region:rollup2
HER WHOLE FAMILY THAT SHE WAS

00:52:18.702 --> 00:52:22.239 region:rollup2
ABLE TO MAKE THIS DECISION ON

00:52:20.137 --> 00:52:23.974 region:rollup2
HER OWN ULTIMATELY. SHE PASSED

00:52:22.239 --> 00:52:25.576 region:rollup2
AWAY A COUPLE OF DAYS BEFORE SHE

00:52:23.974 --> 00:52:26.877 region:rollup2
HAD SET HER DATE.

00:52:25.576 --> 00:52:28.412 region:rollup2
TO OUT TO DO IT.

00:52:26.877 --> 00:52:31.181 region:rollup2
.

00:52:28.412 --> 00:52:32.883 region:rollup2
AND I THINK AMAZINGLY AND MAYBE

00:52:31.181 --> 00:52:34.385 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I AS A LAWMAKER WHO

00:52:32.883 --> 00:52:35.986 region:rollup2
VOTED ON IT I HAD MUCH%

00:52:34.385 --> 00:52:37.588 region:rollup2
GREATER ANXIETY AS THE DATE

00:52:35.986 --> 00:52:40.090 region:rollup2
APPROACHED.

00:52:37.588 --> 00:52:42.192 region:rollup2
THEN HER DAUGHTER DEAD OR MY

00:52:40.090 --> 00:52:44.428 region:rollup2
MOTHER AND MY DAD AND I AND DOT

00:52:42.192 --> 00:52:46.263 region:rollup2
WHO WERE REALLY AT PEACE WITH

00:52:44.428 --> 00:52:47.264 region:rollup2
THAT THERE OF MOTHER AND AUNT

00:52:46.263 --> 00:52:49.967 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE DECISION.

00:52:47.264 --> 00:52:51.502 region:rollup2
THAT THEY WERE MAKING FOR ABOUT

00:52:49.967 --> 00:52:53.771 region:rollup2
FOR COMFORT FOR DIGNITY.

00:52:51.502 --> 00:52:55.873 region:rollup2
AND ON AND SO FROM THAT

00:52:53.771 --> 00:52:57.808 region:rollup2
VIEWPOINT IT IT REALLY WORKED A

00:52:55.873 --> 00:52:59.777 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF WAYS.

00:52:57.808 --> 00:53:01.812 region:rollup2
TO. TO TO HELP.

00:52:59.777 --> 00:53:03.080 region:rollup2
.

00:53:01.812 --> 00:53:05.082 region:rollup2
EVEN THOUGH IT SHE SHE WAS

00:53:03.080 --> 00:53:07.151 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY ABLE TO TO TO USE IT.

00:53:05.082 --> 00:53:07.885 region:rollup2
ON.

00:53:07.151 --> 00:53:10.154 region:rollup2
THE DATA SHOW US.

00:53:07.885 --> 00:53:11.255 region:rollup2
.

00:53:10.154 --> 00:53:12.289 region:rollup2
SUN SOME NUMBERS THAT I DON'T

00:53:11.255 --> 00:53:13.991 region:rollup2
KNOW IF I WOULD SAY THAT THEIR

00:53:12.289 --> 00:53:15.859 region:rollup2
SURPRISING NUMBERS I DON'T KNOW

00:53:13.991 --> 00:53:17.995 region:rollup2
IF I HAD.

00:53:15.859 --> 00:53:19.997 region:rollup2
EXPECTATIONS ABOUT.

00:53:17.995 --> 00:53:21.765 region:rollup2
HOW MANY PEOPLE WOULD BE USING

00:53:19.997 --> 00:53:22.1000 region:rollup2
IT ON AN ANNUAL BASIS

00:53:21.765 --> 00:53:25.235 region:rollup2
OR HOW MANY DOCTORS WOULD BE

00:53:22.1000 --> 00:53:26.737 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATING? OR WHAT THE SOCIO

00:53:25.235 --> 00:53:28.872 region:rollup2
ECONOMIC MAKEUP OF SOMEONE WOULD

00:53:26.737 --> 00:53:30.908 region:rollup2
BE.

00:53:28.872 --> 00:53:32.810 region:rollup2
I. KNOW I THINK OUR HOPE WAS IS

00:53:30.908 --> 00:53:34.611 region:rollup2
THAT IT WOULD PROVIDE.

00:53:32.810 --> 00:53:35.679 region:rollup2
AN OPTION FOR EVERYBODY CAN

00:53:34.611 --> 00:53:37.448 region:rollup2
NEEDS IT.

00:53:35.679 --> 00:53:40.350 region:rollup2
AND.

00:53:37.448 --> 00:53:41.852 region:rollup2
I AND I THINK THAT THERE ARE.

00:53:40.350 --> 00:53:44.154 region:rollup2
I I AGAIN I DON'T RECALL THEM

00:53:41.852 --> 00:53:45.622 region:rollup2
SHORTCOMINGS BUT SOME GAPS IN

00:53:44.154 --> 00:53:47.357 region:rollup2
HOW CALIFORNIANS ARE USING IT.

00:53:45.622 --> 00:53:48.058 region:rollup2
.

00:53:47.357 --> 00:53:49.760 region:rollup2
BUT THE SOCIOECONOMIC WAY

00:53:48.058 --> 00:53:50.561 region:rollup2
DEMOGRAPHICALLY.

00:53:49.760 --> 00:53:52.362 region:rollup2
AND.

00:53:50.561 --> 00:53:54.098 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE NUMBERS AT AGAIN

00:53:52.362 --> 00:53:55.933 region:rollup2
THAT DIDN'T JUMP AT ME BUT ONE

00:53:54.098 --> 00:53:56.834 region:rollup2
THAT I NOTICE WAS THE.

00:53:55.933 --> 00:53:58.535 region:rollup2
ALONG WITH THE NUMBER OF

00:53:56.834 --> 00:53:59.703 region:rollup2
PATIENTS.

00:53:58.535 --> 00:54:01.438 region:rollup2
THE NUMBER OF PHYSICIANS WHO

00:53:59.703 --> 00:54:03.173 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATED.

00:54:01.438 --> 00:54:06.944 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT IN THE RUN UP

00:54:03.173 --> 00:54:08.245 region:rollup2
TO. THE VOTE ON THE BILL.

00:54:06.944 --> 00:54:10.714 region:rollup2
NO THERE ARE A LOT OF OF MYTHS

00:54:08.245 --> 00:54:12.950 region:rollup2
AND CLAIMS ABOUT YOU KNOW.

00:54:10.714 --> 00:54:14.885 region:rollup2
HOW THIS WOULD BE USED THAT I

00:54:12.950 --> 00:54:15.619 region:rollup2
DON'T THINK WERE REALIZED ON IN

00:54:14.885 --> 00:54:16.787 region:rollup2
A POSITIVE WAY?

00:54:15.619 --> 00:54:19.223 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:54:16.787 --> 00:54:20.424 region:rollup2
THERE WASN'T.

00:54:19.223 --> 00:54:22.760 region:rollup2
IT DOES NOT APPEAR TO ME IN

00:54:20.424 --> 00:54:24.828 region:rollup2
NUMBERS THAT.

00:54:22.760 --> 00:54:25.629 region:rollup2
THERE IS THERE SOMETHING THAT'S

00:54:24.828 --> 00:54:28.332 region:rollup2
NOT WORKING.

00:54:25.629 --> 00:54:30.167 region:rollup2
IN A IN A NEFARIOUS WAY IS WHAT

00:54:28.332 --> 00:54:31.602 region:rollup2
I MEAN AND AND THAT DON.

00:54:30.167 --> 00:54:33.570 region:rollup2
ANY OF THE CONCERNS ABOUT.

00:54:31.602 --> 00:54:34.638 region:rollup2
CERTAIN DOCTORS BEING THE

00:54:33.570 --> 00:54:36.006 region:rollup2
DOCTORS THAT PEOPLE WOULD GO TO

00:54:34.638 --> 00:54:37.641 region:rollup2
FOR THIS.

00:54:36.006 --> 00:54:39.977 region:rollup2
ON IT SEEMED THE NUMBER OF

00:54:37.641 --> 00:54:41.845 region:rollup2
DOCTORS AT PARTICIPATING AS JUST

00:54:39.977 --> 00:54:43.013 region:rollup2
ONLY A BIT LESS THAN THE NUMBER

00:54:41.845 --> 00:54:44.515 region:rollup2
OF PEOPLE AVAILING THEMSELVES OF

00:54:43.013 --> 00:54:45.849 region:rollup2
THE OPTION.

00:54:44.515 --> 00:54:47.851 region:rollup2
SO TO ME IT MEANS THAT.

00:54:45.849 --> 00:54:49.319 region:rollup2
THERE ARE THAT.

00:54:47.851 --> 00:54:50.454 region:rollup2
THEY'RE NOT BEING FUNNELED TO

00:54:49.319 --> 00:54:51.622 region:rollup2
ONE OR TWO DOCTORS MANY

00:54:50.454 --> 00:54:53.557 region:rollup2
PHYSICIANS ARE ABLE TO HELP

00:54:51.622 --> 00:54:54.958 region:rollup2
THEIR PATIENTS.

00:54:53.557 --> 00:54:57.761 region:rollup2
THAT DAY THAT THERE WHILE THERE

00:54:54.958 --> 00:54:59.496 region:rollup2
MAY BE SOME BARRIERS TO HELPING

00:54:57.761 --> 00:55:01.131 region:rollup2
ALL PATIENTS THAT IT'S NOT

00:54:59.496 --> 00:55:02.432 region:rollup2
LIMITED TO JUST A CERTAIN NUMBER

00:55:01.131 --> 00:55:04.635 region:rollup2
OF DOCTORS WHO ARE ABLE TO

00:55:02.432 --> 00:55:06.303 region:rollup2
NAVIGATE AT WAR ARE PUSHING.

00:55:04.635 --> 00:55:08.272 region:rollup2
THEIR PATIENCE TOWARD THIS

00:55:06.303 --> 00:55:09.506 region:rollup2
OPTION IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE ANY

00:55:08.272 --> 00:55:11.241 region:rollup2
OF THESE POSITIONS ARE. YOU KNOW

00:55:09.506 --> 00:55:12.709 region:rollup2
ADVISING MORE THAN JUST A

00:55:11.241 --> 00:55:14.545 region:rollup2
HANDFUL IF THAT GIVEN.

00:55:12.709 --> 00:55:16.380 region:rollup2
THE SMALL NUMBER ABOVE THE TOTAL

00:55:14.545 --> 00:55:17.414 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF PATIENTS

00:55:16.380 --> 00:55:19.149 region:rollup2
AT OR BELOW THE TOTAL NUMBER

00:55:17.414 --> 00:55:19.750 region:rollup2
PATIENTS OF PHYSICIANS.

00:55:19.149 --> 00:55:22.219 region:rollup2
AND.

00:55:19.750 --> 00:55:23.854 region:rollup2
AND SO JUST LOOKING AT THE DATA.

00:55:22.219 --> 00:55:25.522 region:rollup2

00:55:23.854 --> 00:55:26.089 region:rollup2
THAT I'VE HAD I'D LOVE TO HEAR

00:55:26.089 --> 00:55:28.292 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:55:26.657 --> 00:55:30.761 region:rollup2
.

00:55:28.292 --> 00:55:32.696 region:rollup2
BUT SIDE BUT IT IT LOOKS LOOKS

00:55:30.761 --> 00:55:33.330 region:rollup2
GOOD SO FAR TO ME ON ON WHAT

00:55:32.696 --> 00:55:34.965 region:rollup2
SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS THAT WERE

00:55:33.330 --> 00:55:37.568 region:rollup2
RAISED.

00:55:34.965 --> 00:55:39.203 region:rollup2
I AM GLAD TO HEAR THAT YOU'RE

00:55:37.568 --> 00:55:40.838 region:rollup2

IN MY OWN INSTITUTION INITIALLY

00:55:50.514 --> 00:55:53.784 region:rollup2
THERE WERE ONLY TWO OF US THAT

CAME OVER AT. UP FORWARD AT A

00:55:53.784 --> 00:55:58.689 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN HUNDRED PHYSICIANS.

00:55:56.253 --> 00:55:59.990 region:rollup2
AND WHEN WE DID THAT THAT

00:55:58.689 --> 00:56:01.925 region:rollup2
TRAINING FOR AT.

00:55:59.990 --> 00:56:03.527 region:rollup2
THOSE OF US THAT WERE WILLING

00:56:01.925 --> 00:56:05.529 region:rollup2
SAID THAT WE WOULD BE WILLING TO

HELP OTHERS THROUGH AND BY THIS

00:56:05.529 --> 00:56:08.632 region:rollup2
I MEAN. I'M.

CONTACTING THE OREGON AND

00:56:08.632 --> 00:56:11.535 region:rollup2
WASHINGTON PHYSICIANS PUTTING

TECH TALKING ACROSS THE STATE

00:56:11.535 --> 00:56:14.905 region:rollup2
WITH MY COLLEAGUES AND THEN

00:56:13.036 --> 00:56:16.974 region:rollup2
PROVIDING MENTORING FOR THOSE

00:56:14.905 --> 00:56:18.642 region:rollup2
MORE CLOSE AND WE HAVE OVER A

AT MY INSTITUTION. AND MANY MORE

00:56:20.844 --> 00:56:23.513 region:rollup2
THAT THAN THE HALF THAT HAVE THE

00:56:21.979 --> 00:56:25.782 region:rollup2
HOW THE CONVERSATION.

00:56:23.513 --> 00:56:28.118 region:rollup2
AGAIN THE DATA DOESN'T COLLECT

00:56:25.782 --> 00:56:29.786 region:rollup2
THE THE CONVERSATION AND THAT IS

00:56:28.118 --> 00:56:31.054 region:rollup2
HAPPENING ACROSS THE STATE

00:56:29.786 --> 00:56:32.089 region:rollup2
THERE'S NO WAY TO GRAB IT IT'S

00:56:31.054 --> 00:56:33.156 region:rollup2
IN THE PRIVACY OF OUR OFFICES

00:56:32.089 --> 00:56:34.958 region:rollup2
WHERE IT BELONGS.

00:56:33.156 --> 00:56:36.460 region:rollup2

FIRST COUPLE OF PRE LA ME THE

00:56:40.030 --> 00:56:43.734 region:rollup2
FORMS AT CENTER BUT ACTUALLY

00:56:41.765 --> 00:56:44.868 region:rollup2
PRESCRIPTION AND MANY LIKE IN

00:56:43.734 --> 00:56:45.903 region:rollup2
YOUR CASE OF YOUR GREAT AT SOUTH

00:56:44.868 --> 00:56:47.905 region:rollup2

OWN CHOICE WITH.

00:56:49.339 --> 00:56:53.577 region:rollup2
WITHIN THE LAW UP MOST MANY

00:56:51.441 --> 00:56:55.245 region:rollup2
PEOPLE ACTUALLY PASSED AWAY

00:56:53.577 --> 00:56:56.680 region:rollup2
BEFORE WORD IN A DIFFERENT KIND

00:56:55.245 --> 00:56:58.048 region:rollup2
OF WAY AND WE HAVE NONE OF. IT

00:56:56.680 --> 00:57:00.250 region:rollup2
IS NO WAY TO CAPTURE THAT DATA

00:56:58.048 --> 00:57:02.286 region:rollup2
BUT ANECDOTALLY I WOULD SAY THAT

00:57:00.250 --> 00:57:03.921 region:rollup2
IT'S WHEN SOMEBODY THAT YOU KNOW

00:57:02.286 --> 00:57:06.657 region:rollup2
AND CARE ABOUT COMES TO YOU AND

00:57:03.921 --> 00:57:08.025 region:rollup2
ASKS YOU ABOUT IT. THAT SUDDENLY

00:57:06.657 --> 00:57:09.927 region:rollup2
YOUR WILLINGNESS AND ABILITY TO

00:57:08.025 --> 00:57:11.428 region:rollup2
GRASP IT GET INFORMATION AND

00:57:09.927 --> 00:57:13.230 region:rollup2
PROVIDE EXCELLENT CARE COMES

00:57:11.428 --> 00:57:14.631 region:rollup2
FORWARD AND THAT'S NOT DIFFERENT

00:57:13.230 --> 00:57:17.901 region:rollup2
THAN OTHER THINGS THAT WE DO IN

00:57:14.631 --> 00:57:19.436 region:rollup2
MEDICINE. WE ARE ALWAYS THE BEST

00:57:17.901 --> 00:57:21.038 region:rollup2
EXPERTS ON OUR LAST CASE.

00:57:19.436 --> 00:57:23.340 region:rollup2
WHICH IS AS IT SHOULD BE WE

00:57:21.038 --> 00:57:24.041 region:rollup2
SHOULD ALL BE GEEKY AND CURIOUS

00:57:23.340 --> 00:57:30.147 region:rollup2
OUR WHOLE CAREERS.

00:57:24.041 --> 00:57:31.782 region:rollup2
BUT THAT'S MY THOUGHT ABOUT IT.

00:57:30.147 --> 00:57:33.283 region:rollup2
I THINK YOU AND I WELCOME ALSO

00:57:31.782 --> 00:57:35.385 region:rollup2

THIS ISSUE.

00:57:41.658 --> 00:57:44.661 region:rollup2
I'VE BEEN IN PRACTICES A

00:57:42.959 --> 00:57:47.197 region:rollup2
POSITION FOR ABOUT TWENTY SEVEN

00:57:44.661 --> 00:57:48.932 region:rollup2
YEARS NOW CAN. MUCH OF MY

THE COURSE OF MY CAREER.

00:57:57.741 --> 00:58:01.411 region:rollup2
WHEN AID IN DYING WAS

00:57:59.409 --> 00:58:04.081 region:rollup2
INTRODUCED AS AN ALLOWABLE

00:58:01.411 --> 00:58:05.382 region:rollup2
PRACTICE IN CALIFORNIA.

00:58:04.081 --> 00:58:07.651 region:rollup2
I DID THIS IS A NATURAL

00:58:05.382 --> 00:58:08.218 region:rollup2
EXTENSION OF THE CARE THAT WE

00:58:07.651 --> 00:58:09.586 region:rollup2
ARE A PROVIDE AT THE END OF

00:58:08.218 --> 00:58:11.855 region:rollup2
LIFE.

00:58:09.586 --> 00:58:14.424 region:rollup2
DEATH HAS ALWAYS BEEN A

00:58:11.855 --> 00:58:15.759 region:rollup2
PROFOUND. AT TIMES MESSY HEART

00:58:14.424 --> 00:58:17.694 region:rollup2
WRENCHING PART OF THE HUMAN

00:58:15.759 --> 00:58:18.862 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE.

00:58:17.694 --> 00:58:21.331 region:rollup2
AID IN DYING DOES NOT ELIMINATE

00:58:18.862 --> 00:58:22.966 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:58:21.331 --> 00:58:25.168 region:rollup2
THE PATIENTS I'VE CARED FOR OVER

00:58:22.966 --> 00:58:27.004 region:rollup2
THE PAST ONE AND A HALF YEARS

00:58:25.168 --> 00:58:28.472 region:rollup2
SINCE THIS HAS BEEN ALLOWED.

00:58:27.004 --> 00:58:30.707 region:rollup2
WHO HAVE COME TO ME SEEKING AID

00:58:28.472 --> 00:58:32.909 region:rollup2
IN DYING? HAVE TAUGHT ME A LOT

00:58:30.707 --> 00:58:34.444 region:rollup2
ABOUT FACING ONE'S OWN DEATH.

00:58:32.909 --> 00:58:36.413 region:rollup2
THEY'RE PEOPLE WHO OF A FIRM

00:58:34.444 --> 00:58:39.282 region:rollup2
GRASP ON THE REALITY THAT THEIR

00:58:36.413 --> 00:58:40.484 region:rollup2
LIVES ARE. A COMING TO AN END.

00:58:39.282 --> 00:58:42.552 region:rollup2
THEY TELL ME THAT THEY ARE

00:58:40.484 --> 00:58:44.755 region:rollup2
GRATEFUL FOR THEIR LIFE.

00:58:42.552 --> 00:58:46.556 region:rollup2
AND THEY DON'T FEAR DEATH.

00:58:44.755 --> 00:58:49.593 region:rollup2
BUT WHAT THEY DO FEAR IS.

00:58:46.556 --> 00:58:52.062 region:rollup2
EXTENDED UNNECESSARY SUFFERING.

00:58:49.593 --> 00:58:53.597 region:rollup2
BEFORE THEY DIE.

00:58:52.062 --> 00:58:54.431 region:rollup2
OF COURSE WE ALWAYS DO OUR BEST

00:58:53.597 --> 00:58:56.199 region:rollup2
TO ALLEVIATE THEIR SUCH

00:58:54.431 --> 00:58:57.868 region:rollup2
SUFFERING AND IN THE MAJORITY OF

00:58:56.199 --> 00:58:59.536 region:rollup2
CASES WERE ABLE TO DO THAT

00:58:57.868 --> 00:59:02.072 region:rollup2
SUCCESSFULLY WITH GOOD SUPPORT

00:58:59.536 --> 00:59:03.473 region:rollup2
OF HOSPICE PALLIATIVE CARE.

00:59:02.072 --> 00:59:05.075 region:rollup2
BUT DESPITE OUR BEST EFFORTS.

00:59:03.473 --> 00:59:07.644 region:rollup2
THERE ARE ALWAYS SOME CASES

00:59:05.075 --> 00:59:09.646 region:rollup2
THAT WE CANNOT ACCOMPLISH THAT.

00:59:07.644 --> 00:59:11.648 region:rollup2
THIS IS WHY I'VE ALWAYS BELIEVED

00:59:09.646 --> 00:59:13.216 region:rollup2
THAT AID IN DYING.

00:59:11.648 --> 00:59:15.786 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE A LAST RESORT BUT IT

00:59:13.216 --> 00:59:17.788 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE AVAILABLE.

00:59:15.786 --> 00:59:19.923 region:rollup2
THE POSITIVE ASPECT FOR ME.

00:59:17.788 --> 00:59:22.893 region:rollup2
I HAS BEEN.

00:59:19.923 --> 00:59:24.361 region:rollup2
MY EXPERIENCE THUS FAR.

00:59:22.893 --> 00:59:26.530 region:rollup2
WITH THE PATIENTS WHO I OF

00:59:24.361 --> 00:59:28.565 region:rollup2
PRESCRIBED IN DYING FOR.

00:59:26.530 --> 00:59:30.600 region:rollup2
.

00:59:28.565 --> 00:59:32.636 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE YOU KNOW FORMALLY

00:59:30.600 --> 00:59:33.537 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE VERY PEACEFUL DOUBTS

00:59:32.636 --> 00:59:35.405 region:rollup2
AT HOME WITH THEIR FAMILY UP

00:59:33.537 --> 00:59:37.808 region:rollup2
THEIR SIDE.

00:59:35.405 --> 00:59:40.477 region:rollup2
AND THEY'VE BEEN.

00:59:37.808 --> 00:59:43.713 region:rollup2
VERY GRATEFUL FOR THIS.

00:59:40.477 --> 00:59:46.116 region:rollup2
ABILITY TO TO DO SO.

00:59:43.713 --> 00:59:46.883 region:rollup2
THIS TO ME IS A STARK CONTRAST

00:59:46.116 --> 00:59:49.486 region:rollup2
FROM THE DEATHS THAT I SEE IN

00:59:46.883 --> 00:59:51.488 region:rollup2
OUR ICE USE ON A DAILY BASIS.

00:59:49.486 --> 00:59:54.024 region:rollup2
WHERE DEL FOOD BECOMES MEDICAL

00:59:51.488 --> 00:59:56.059 region:rollup2
EYES DE PERSONALIZED INVASIVE

00:59:54.024 --> 00:59:57.427 region:rollup2
AND SOMETIMES VIOLENT?

00:59:56.059 --> 00:59:59.596 region:rollup2
FOR SOME REASON NOBODY SEEMS TO

00:59:57.427 --> 01:00:01.231 region:rollup2
QUESTION ABOUT PRACTICE.

00:59:59.596 --> 01:00:02.833 region:rollup2
I'M MUCH MORE AT PEACE WITH THE

01:00:01.231 --> 01:00:06.470 region:rollup2
FORMER SCENARIO THAN I AM WITH

01:00:02.833 --> 01:00:07.537 region:rollup2
THE LATTER.

01:00:06.470 --> 01:00:09.706 region:rollup2
THE CHALLENGES.

01:00:07.537 --> 01:00:10.340 region:rollup2
THE MOST SURPRISING ASPECT FOR

01:00:09.706 --> 01:00:12.375 region:rollup2
ME.

01:00:10.340 --> 01:00:14.778 region:rollup2
IN THESE CASES THAT I DID NOT

01:00:12.375 --> 01:00:16.847 region:rollup2
ANTICIPATE. WAS THE SENSE OF

01:00:14.778 --> 01:00:18.448 region:rollup2
URGENCY THAT PATIENTS HAVE ONCE

01:00:16.847 --> 01:00:20.517 region:rollup2
THEY MAKE THIS DECISION.

01:00:18.448 --> 01:00:22.786 region:rollup2
FOR THEM EVEN AT TWO TO THREE

01:00:20.517 --> 01:00:24.387 region:rollup2
DELAY IN THE PROCESS SOMETIMES

01:00:22.786 --> 01:00:26.456 region:rollup2
SEEMS TO BE EXCRUCIATING. ON

01:00:24.387 --> 01:00:29.593 region:rollup2
THIS WAS NOT SOMETHING THAT I

01:00:26.456 --> 01:00:31.294 region:rollup2
PERSONALLY ANTICIPATED SEEN.

01:00:29.593 --> 01:00:32.996 region:rollup2
GIVEN THE MULTIPLE STEPS THAT

01:00:31.294 --> 01:00:34.297 region:rollup2
ARE REQUIRED IN THE PROCESS.

01:00:32.996 --> 01:00:36.099 region:rollup2
THERE ARE GONNA BE INEVITABLE

01:00:34.297 --> 01:00:38.401 region:rollup2
DELAYS THIS IS.

01:00:36.099 --> 01:00:40.637 region:rollup2
IN ALMOST NO CASE IS FIFTEEN

01:00:38.401 --> 01:00:42.139 region:rollup2
DAY PROCESS.

01:00:40.637 --> 01:00:44.007 region:rollup2
I DID IN IN EUROPE THEM JUST

01:00:42.139 --> 01:00:45.108 region:rollup2
MEAN YOUR MEDICAL OPINION IS IS

01:00:44.007 --> 01:00:48.378 region:rollup2
THE REQUIREMENTS WE LAID OUT TO

01:00:45.108 --> 01:00:50.280 region:rollup2
OWNERS.

01:00:48.378 --> 01:00:52.349 region:rollup2
I THINK THE CHALLENGE IS

01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:54.784 region:rollup2
BALANCING SAFETY VERSES.

01:00:52.349 --> 01:00:55.685 region:rollup2
HURDLES.

01:00:54.784 --> 01:00:57.621 region:rollup2
AND WHICH WHICH IS WHAT THAT

01:00:55.685 --> 01:00:59.055 region:rollup2
WHICH IS WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO

01:00:57.621 --> 01:00:59.256 region:rollup2
RIGHT IN THE EMPLOYMENT TATIAN.

01:00:59.055 --> 01:01:01.224 region:rollup2
RIGHT.

01:00:59.256 --> 01:01:02.692 region:rollup2
.

01:01:01.224 --> 01:01:05.395 region:rollup2
AND I I THINK IT'S KIND OF.

01:01:02.692 --> 01:01:06.496 region:rollup2
ON ON THE EDGE BETWEEN THOSE

01:01:05.395 --> 01:01:08.665 region:rollup2
TWO ON THAT BALANCE.

01:01:06.496 --> 01:01:11.902 region:rollup2
.

01:01:08.665 --> 01:01:13.570 region:rollup2
IN YOU KNOW IN MOST CASES IF IF

01:01:11.902 --> 01:01:15.005 region:rollup2
THE PATIENT AS WELL ENOUGH TO TO

01:01:13.570 --> 01:01:16.740 region:rollup2
MAKE THE VISITS I DON'T THINK

01:01:15.005 --> 01:01:18.308 region:rollup2
IT'S BURDENSOME I THINK IF THEY

01:01:16.740 --> 01:01:19.643 region:rollup2
DON'T START THE PROCESS UNTIL

01:01:18.308 --> 01:01:21.678 region:rollup2
THEY'RE VERY FRAIL AND IT'S VERY

01:01:19.643 --> 01:01:23.613 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT TO THEM. FOR THEM TO

01:01:21.678 --> 01:01:25.782 region:rollup2
MAKE THE MANDATED THREE OF FOUR

01:01:23.613 --> 01:01:27.751 region:rollup2
VISITS IT BECOMES. VERY

01:01:25.782 --> 01:01:29.419 region:rollup2
BURDENSOME.

01:01:27.751 --> 01:01:31.521 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S THE CHALLENGE IS HOW

01:01:29.419 --> 01:01:33.189 region:rollup2
HOW TO BALANCE THOSE.

01:01:31.521 --> 01:01:35.492 region:rollup2
THE OTHER CHALLENGE THAT WE'VE

01:01:33.189 --> 01:01:35.725 region:rollup2
ENCOUNTERED.

01:01:35.492 --> 01:01:37.027 region:rollup2
IS THAT.

01:01:35.725 --> 01:01:39.396 region:rollup2
.

01:01:37.027 --> 01:01:40.931 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE DELAYS THAT OCCUR

01:01:39.396 --> 01:01:42.132 region:rollup2
ONE IS IF THAT PATIENT

01:01:40.931 --> 01:01:43.667 region:rollup2
APPROACHES THE PHYSICIAN OR

01:01:42.132 --> 01:01:45.135 region:rollup2
PHYSICIANS WHO HAVE BEEN CARING

01:01:43.667 --> 01:01:46.269 region:rollup2
FOR THEM AND THOSE FIRST

01:01:45.135 --> 01:01:47.604 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR PHYSICIANS ARE OPTING

01:01:46.269 --> 01:01:49.105 region:rollup2
OUT.

01:01:47.604 --> 01:01:50.207 region:rollup2
THEN THERE'S A DELAY OF

01:01:49.105 --> 01:01:52.442 region:rollup2
REDIRECTING THEM TO ANOTHER

01:01:50.207 --> 01:01:54.110 region:rollup2
PHYSICIAN WHO'S WILLING TO

01:01:52.442 --> 01:01:56.179 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATE IN AID IN DYING.

01:01:54.110 --> 01:01:57.881 region:rollup2
WORRIED.

01:01:56.179 --> 01:01:59.082 region:rollup2
MOST CASES HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO

01:01:57.881 --> 01:02:01.017 region:rollup2
THAT SUCCESSFULLY BUT THAT TAKES

01:01:59.082 --> 01:02:02.752 region:rollup2
A LONG TIME.

01:02:01.017 --> 01:02:05.088 region:rollup2
IF THE PATIENT HAS ALREADY

01:02:02.752 --> 01:02:06.756 region:rollup2
ENROLLED IN HOSPICE SERVICE AND

01:02:05.088 --> 01:02:08.925 region:rollup2
THEN REQUESTS AID IN DYING AND

01:02:06.756 --> 01:02:10.627 region:rollup2
THEY NO LONGER HAVE ACCESS BACK

01:02:08.925 --> 01:02:12.529 region:rollup2
TO THEIR TREATING PREVIOUS

01:02:10.627 --> 01:02:15.298 region:rollup2
TREATING PHYSICIANS. AND THEY

01:02:12.529 --> 01:02:17.267 region:rollup2
HOSPICES NOT PARTICIPATING.

01:02:15.298 --> 01:02:19.336 region:rollup2
THAT BECOMES VERY DIFFICULT TO

01:02:17.267 --> 01:02:21.004 region:rollup2
NAVIGATE BECAUSE NOW THEY HAVE

01:02:19.336 --> 01:02:22.339 region:rollup2
TO OFTENTIMES PAY OUT OF POCKET

01:02:21.004 --> 01:02:24.007 region:rollup2
TO GO BACK TO THE PREVIOUS

01:02:22.339 --> 01:02:25.642 region:rollup2
POSITIONS PAY FOR THE THREE OR

01:02:24.007 --> 01:02:28.378 region:rollup2
FOUR VISITS.

01:02:25.642 --> 01:02:31.147 region:rollup2
MAKE THOSE APPOINTMENTS.

01:02:28.378 --> 01:02:33.116 region:rollup2
AND THAT BECOMES OFTENTIMES A

01:02:31.147 --> 01:02:39.556 region:rollup2
BUT A BIG HURDLE.

01:02:33.116 --> 01:02:41.558 region:rollup2
.

01:02:39.556 --> 01:02:43.526 region:rollup2
AND AS I SAID THE TO THE

01:02:41.558 --> 01:02:45.428 region:rollup2
PATIENTS ONCE ONCE THEY'RE VERY

01:02:43.526 --> 01:02:47.597 region:rollup2
FRAIL AND IT DIFFICULT TO TO

01:02:45.428 --> 01:02:50.066 region:rollup2
TRANSPORT IT BECOMES VERY HARD.

01:02:47.597 --> 01:02:51.801 region:rollup2
.

01:02:50.066 --> 01:02:53.370 region:rollup2
FOR ME THE MOST DIFFICULT CASES

01:02:51.801 --> 01:02:54.771 region:rollup2
I'VE ENCOUNTERED HAVE ACTUALLY

01:02:53.370 --> 01:02:57.040 region:rollup2
BEEN THE PATIENTS WHO WANT AID

01:02:54.771 --> 01:02:59.075 region:rollup2
IN DYING AND FOR VARIOUS REASONS

01:02:57.040 --> 01:03:00.477 region:rollup2
DON'T QUALIFY. MOST OFTEN

01:02:59.075 --> 01:03:02.612 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY'RE GIVEN AN

01:03:00.477 --> 01:03:05.081 region:rollup2
EXTENDED PROGNOSIS.

01:03:02.612 --> 01:03:06.583 region:rollup2
FOR THEM THE FACT THAT AID IN

01:03:05.081 --> 01:03:09.452 region:rollup2
DYING IS AVAILABLE BUT THEY

01:03:06.583 --> 01:03:10.720 region:rollup2
DON'T QUALIFY. SEEMS TO ACTUALLY

01:03:09.452 --> 01:03:13.390 region:rollup2
WORSEN THEIR SUFFERING.

01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:15.325 region:rollup2
.

01:03:13.390 --> 01:03:17.927 region:rollup2
AS ONE PATIENT COMMENTED TO ME

01:03:15.325 --> 01:03:20.397 region:rollup2
IN THIS ODD KIND OF SITUATION

01:03:17.927 --> 01:03:22.298 region:rollup2
THEY SAID. IT SAYS OF MIND MY

01:03:20.397 --> 01:03:23.733 region:rollup2
SUFFERING DOESN'T MATTER.

01:03:22.298 --> 01:03:25.568 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S BEEN.

01:03:23.733 --> 01:03:27.237 region:rollup2
PAINFUL TO WITNESS.

01:03:25.568 --> 01:03:28.738 region:rollup2
THAT ONE GROUP OF PATIENTS OF

01:03:27.237 --> 01:03:29.739 region:rollup2
FALLS INTO THIS CATEGORY MORE

01:03:28.738 --> 01:03:31.441 region:rollup2
OFTEN THAN NOT IS THE A LS

01:03:29.739 --> 01:03:33.176 region:rollup2
PATIENTS.

01:03:31.441 --> 01:03:34.577 region:rollup2
WHEN THEY'RE AT A POINT WHERE

01:03:33.176 --> 01:03:36.913 region:rollup2
THEY CAN STILL.

01:03:34.577 --> 01:03:38.314 region:rollup2
PHYSICALLY SELF ADMINISTER

01:03:36.913 --> 01:03:40.016 region:rollup2
OFTENTIMES THEY DON'T YET HAVE A

01:03:38.314 --> 01:03:42.952 region:rollup2
LESS THAN SIX MONTHS PROGNOSIS

01:03:40.016 --> 01:03:43.453 region:rollup2
SO THEY'RE TRAPPED AND AND THOSE

01:03:42.952 --> 01:03:44.621 region:rollup2
THIS REALLY CREATE SOME

01:03:43.453 --> 01:03:46.856 region:rollup2
SUFFERING.

01:03:44.621 --> 01:03:49.459 region:rollup2
.

01:03:46.856 --> 01:03:50.060 region:rollup2
AND SO SADLY I THINK BECAUSE THE

01:03:49.459 --> 01:03:52.562 region:rollup2
OF THE. INORDINATE DIFFICULTY

01:03:50.060 --> 01:03:54.631 region:rollup2
IN.

01:03:52.562 --> 01:03:56.966 region:rollup2
OUR ABILITY TO ACCURATELY

01:03:54.631 --> 01:03:58.802 region:rollup2
PROGNOSTICATOR AS A NAY AS IN

01:03:56.966 --> 01:04:00.503 region:rollup2
ANY OTHER FORM OF TRYING TO

01:03:58.802 --> 01:04:02.472 region:rollup2
PREDICT THE FUTURE.

01:04:00.503 --> 01:04:03.973 region:rollup2
DIDN'T SOME OF THOSE PATIENTS

01:04:02.472 --> 01:04:05.075 region:rollup2
WHO WANTED AID IN DYING WERE

01:04:03.973 --> 01:04:07.043 region:rollup2
TOLD THEY HAVE A GREATER THAN

01:04:05.075 --> 01:04:08.645 region:rollup2
SIX MONTHS PROGNOSIS OF THEY

01:04:07.043 --> 01:04:10.313 region:rollup2
DIDN'T. A QUALIFIED.

01:04:08.645 --> 01:04:12.982 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY ENDED UP DYING WITHIN A

01:04:10.313 --> 01:04:15.919 region:rollup2
FEW MONTHS. OTHER PATIENTS WHO

01:04:12.982 --> 01:04:17.520 region:rollup2
WE'VE DEEMED QUALIFYING GOT THE

01:04:15.919 --> 01:04:19.055 region:rollup2
PRESCRIPTION SOME OF THEM LIVED

01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:20.323 region:rollup2
FAR BEYOND THE SIX MONTHS WE HAD

01:04:19.055 --> 01:04:22.158 region:rollup2
ONE PATIENT THAT GOT THE

01:04:20.323 --> 01:04:24.694 region:rollup2
PRESCRIPTION OVER A YEAR LATER

01:04:22.158 --> 01:04:26.463 region:rollup2
TOOK IT. SO I THINK GET WE HAVE

01:04:24.694 --> 01:04:27.964 region:rollup2
WE HAVE A CHALLENGE SORTING OUT

01:04:26.463 --> 01:04:30.667 region:rollup2
THE RIGHT PEOPLE WITHOUT WITHOUT

01:04:27.964 --> 01:04:31.201 region:rollup2
LIMITATION.

01:04:30.667 --> 01:04:32.268 region:rollup2
AND WE DON'T ALWAYS GET IT

01:04:31.201 --> 01:04:33.169 region:rollup2
RIGHT.

01:04:32.268 --> 01:04:34.904 region:rollup2
THEN IS THAT ALSO WOULD IT BE

01:04:33.169 --> 01:04:36.439 region:rollup2
BETTER TO DO SIX MONTHS TO A

01:04:34.904 --> 01:04:38.808 region:rollup2
YEAR MORE LEPTIN SYSTEM WITH

01:04:36.439 --> 01:04:40.810 region:rollup2
HOSPICE. THAT'S SO THAT'S MY

01:04:38.808 --> 01:04:41.978 region:rollup2
OPINION BECAUSE WE WE CAN'T

01:04:40.810 --> 01:04:44.547 region:rollup2
PROGNOSTICATOR.

01:04:41.978 --> 01:04:45.982 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY YOU INCUR.

01:04:44.547 --> 01:04:48.451 region:rollup2
I TAKE A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT

01:04:45.982 --> 01:04:50.220 region:rollup2
TACK IT IN TWO WAYS ONE IS.

01:04:48.451 --> 01:04:51.421 region:rollup2
IF SOMEBODY'S IN ITS THE SAME

01:04:50.220 --> 01:04:53.089 region:rollup2
AS I WOULD DO FOR HOSPICE IF

01:04:51.421 --> 01:04:54.824 region:rollup2
SOMEBODY NEEDS TO RECERTIFY FOR

01:04:53.089 --> 01:04:55.592 region:rollup2
HOSPICE BECAUSE BECAUSE THEY

01:04:54.824 --> 01:04:56.693 region:rollup2
LIVED.

01:04:55.592 --> 01:04:57.627 region:rollup2
THIS IS A GOOD THING IF THEY

01:04:56.693 --> 01:04:59.763 region:rollup2
WANTED TO LET THIS IS A GOOD

01:04:57.627 --> 01:05:01.498 region:rollup2
THING SO I'VE JUST SEE THEM BACK

01:04:59.763 --> 01:05:02.932 region:rollup2
I'VE HAD IT HAPPEN TWICE AND.

01:05:01.498 --> 01:05:05.101 region:rollup2
IN EACH TIME.

01:05:02.932 --> 01:05:06.202 region:rollup2
THERE WAS JUST ACTUALLY PEOPLE

01:05:05.101 --> 01:05:08.138 region:rollup2
WERE HAPPY WITH WHAT WAS

01:05:06.202 --> 01:05:09.873 region:rollup2
HAPPENING THE SECOND IS THAT IN

01:05:08.138 --> 01:05:11.708 region:rollup2
OUR INSTITUTION WE DON'T. WRITE

01:05:09.873 --> 01:05:13.009 region:rollup2
THE PRESCRIPTION UNTIL RIGHT

01:05:11.708 --> 01:05:14.410 region:rollup2
BEFORE THE PERSON IS GONNA TAKE

01:05:13.009 --> 01:05:17.947 region:rollup2
ITS A THERE'S NOT MEDICATION

01:05:14.410 --> 01:05:20.016 region:rollup2
AROUND AND FOR THAT REASON ON

01:05:17.947 --> 01:05:21.117 region:rollup2
WEEK WE I KEEP CLOSE CONTACT SO

01:05:20.016 --> 01:05:22.519 region:rollup2
THAT WE CAN.

01:05:21.117 --> 01:05:23.887 region:rollup2
AND ANY OF THIS IS PARTLY

01:05:22.519 --> 01:05:26.289 region:rollup2
BECAUSE EASILY FOR MEDICATIONS

01:05:23.887 --> 01:05:27.357 region:rollup2
AS WELL AND SO WE KEEP CONTACTED

01:05:26.289 --> 01:05:28.892 region:rollup2
THE POINT WHERE THEY'VE DECIDED

01:05:27.357 --> 01:05:30.627 region:rollup2
THIS IS WHAT'S HAPPENING IS

01:05:28.892 --> 01:05:33.129 region:rollup2
MONEY PRESCRIBES IT'S A LITTLE

01:05:30.627 --> 01:05:35.198 region:rollup2
LESS OP PROBLEMATIC. ON IT IN IN

01:05:33.129 --> 01:05:36.666 region:rollup2
THESE CASES BECAUSE OF HOW WE OF

01:05:35.198 --> 01:05:39.068 region:rollup2
ORGANIZED AND HOW I ACTUALLY NOW

01:05:36.666 --> 01:05:41.037 region:rollup2
TRAIN PEOPLE ARE IN THE FRONT

01:05:39.068 --> 01:05:43.106 region:rollup2
LINES. THE OTHER THE OTHER

01:05:41.037 --> 01:05:45.842 region:rollup2
DELAYS THAT I WOULD MENTION HERE

01:05:43.106 --> 01:05:49.078 region:rollup2
ISPHARMACY DELAYS.

01:05:45.842 --> 01:05:51.314 region:rollup2
GETTING THE PHARMACISTS WHO ARE

01:05:49.078 --> 01:05:53.550 region:rollup2
FINDING OUT WHO THEY ARE AND

01:05:51.314 --> 01:05:55.685 region:rollup2
TRAINED AT CENTER LIKE WE REALLY

01:05:53.550 --> 01:05:58.455 region:rollup2
ONLY USE THREE PHARMACIES IN THE

01:05:55.685 --> 01:05:59.856 region:rollup2
WHOLE BAY AREA RIGHT NOW. TIME

01:05:58.455 --> 01:06:01.624 region:rollup2
AND WE'VE HAD SOME DELAYS IN

01:05:59.856 --> 01:06:05.428 region:rollup2
GETTING MEDICATION SO THAT'S

01:06:01.624 --> 01:06:09.032 region:rollup2
ANOTHER. ANOTHER A DELAY.

01:06:05.428 --> 01:06:11.367 region:rollup2
I AGREE WITH THE ONE ABOUT IF

01:06:09.032 --> 01:06:15.805 region:rollup2
THE ORIGINAL PHYSICIAN ATTENDING

01:06:11.367 --> 01:06:18.541 region:rollup2
PHYSICIAN FOR THE DISEASE OR FOR

01:06:15.805 --> 01:06:22.145 region:rollup2
THEIR AT AT AND OF LIFE BECAUSE

01:06:18.541 --> 01:06:23.279 region:rollup2
THAT YOU CAN ATTEND EITHER.

01:06:22.145 --> 01:06:24.481 region:rollup2
IS NOT PARTICIPANT.

01:06:23.279 --> 01:06:25.815 region:rollup2
WHAT IS THE MECHANISM HOW DO WE

01:06:24.481 --> 01:06:26.449 region:rollup2
MOVE SOMEONE INTO INTO AT

01:06:25.815 --> 01:06:27.250 region:rollup2
ANOTHER PATHWAY TO HAVE ACCESS

01:06:26.449 --> 01:06:28.084 region:rollup2
TO

01:06:27.250 --> 01:06:30.119 region:rollup2
CARE? ALL HAS HAPPENED NUMEROUS

01:06:28.084 --> 01:06:31.321 region:rollup2
TIMES ACTION.

01:06:30.119 --> 01:06:32.455 region:rollup2
GOOD THEIR SECRETS AND THEN AT

01:06:31.321 --> 01:06:33.089 region:rollup2
THE END I'D I'D ALSO LIKE TO

01:06:32.455 --> 01:06:33.990 region:rollup2
KNOW WHERE TO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT

01:06:33.089 --> 01:06:35.625 region:rollup2
PRESCRIBING IS IS.

01:06:33.990 --> 01:06:37.894 region:rollup2
IS MEDICATION AVAILABLE AND IS

01:06:35.625 --> 01:06:38.495 region:rollup2
IT STILL BOSSY SECOND ALL OR OR

01:06:37.894 --> 01:06:39.362 region:rollup2
HER ARE PEOPLE DOING DIFFERENT

01:06:38.495 --> 01:06:41.130 region:rollup2
THINGS NOW THAT. I CAN COMMENT

01:06:39.362 --> 01:06:42.298 region:rollup2
ON THAT SO OUR OUR EXPERIENCE

01:06:41.130 --> 01:06:43.600 region:rollup2
HAS BEEN THAT.

01:06:42.298 --> 01:06:44.701 region:rollup2
SECOND ALL IS AVAILABLE

01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:45.568 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE IT'S EXTREMELY COSTLY

01:06:44.701 --> 01:06:46.736 region:rollup2
AND MOST PATIENTS OTHER THAN THE

01:06:45.568 --> 01:06:47.437 region:rollup2
MEDI CAL PATIENTS.

01:06:46.736 --> 01:06:48.738 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE THAT.

01:06:47.437 --> 01:06:49.372 region:rollup2
COVERAGE IN THEIR INSURANCE

01:06:48.738 --> 01:06:50.273 region:rollup2
FORMULARIES AND I COMMITTEE ARE

01:06:49.372 --> 01:06:51.641 region:rollup2
FROM THREE TO FIVE THOUSAND

01:06:50.273 --> 01:06:54.677 region:rollup2
DOLLARS.

01:06:51.641 --> 01:06:56.012 region:rollup2
SO WE HAVE MOSTLY USED SECOND

01:06:54.677 --> 01:06:58.581 region:rollup2
ALL FOR PATIENTS WITH MEDICAL

01:06:56.012 --> 01:07:00.216 region:rollup2
COVERAGE FOR THOSE WITHOUT MEDI%

01:06:58.581 --> 01:07:02.185 region:rollup2
CAL HAVE PRIVATE INSURANCE. WE

01:07:00.216 --> 01:07:05.421 region:rollup2
HAVE RELIED HEAVILY ON ONE FARM

01:07:02.185 --> 01:07:07.223 region:rollup2
ONE COMPOUNDING PHARMACY IN SAN

01:07:05.421 --> 01:07:08.124 region:rollup2
DIEGO WHOSE GEARED UP TO.

01:07:07.223 --> 01:07:10.560 region:rollup2
MAKE UP.

01:07:08.124 --> 01:07:12.662 region:rollup2
A COMPOUNDED COCKTAIL OF.

01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:14.797 region:rollup2
FOUR DIFFERENT MEDICATIONS

01:07:12.662 --> 01:07:16.266 region:rollup2
AND THEY'VE

01:07:14.797 --> 01:07:17.367 region:rollup2
REALLY WORKED OUT THE PROCESS

01:07:16.266 --> 01:07:19.602 region:rollup2
WHERE THEY'RE ABLE TO DO THIS ON

01:07:17.367 --> 01:07:20.803 region:rollup2
A ROUTINE BASIS BUT ALMOST NO

01:07:19.602 --> 01:07:22.672 region:rollup2
OTHER PHARMACY WE FOUND IS ABLE

01:07:20.803 --> 01:07:24.541 region:rollup2
TO DO THAT.

01:07:22.672 --> 01:07:26.576 region:rollup2
BUT THAT STILL UP. OFTENTIMES A

01:07:24.541 --> 01:07:27.143 region:rollup2
THREE THREE DAY PROCESS FOR THEM

01:07:26.576 --> 01:07:28.811 region:rollup2
TO GET THE PAPERWORK AND DO

01:07:27.143 --> 01:07:30.113 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:07:28.811 --> 01:07:31.681 region:rollup2
I AGREE WE ALSO USE THE FOR

01:07:30.113 --> 01:07:33.182 region:rollup2
COMPOUNDING AND ONE OF THE

01:07:31.681 --> 01:07:34.617 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT IS IS INTERESTIG IS

01:07:33.182 --> 01:07:36.352 region:rollup2
TO TRY AND PULL TOGETHER WHAT IS

01:07:34.617 --> 01:07:38.187 region:rollup2
THE BEST MEDICINE WHAT WE KNOW

01:07:36.352 --> 01:07:39.923 region:rollup2
WHAT IS BEST PRACTICE. AND.

01:07:38.187 --> 01:07:41.824 region:rollup2
SO WHAT WE'VE GOTTEN KINDS

01:07:39.923 --> 01:07:43.660 region:rollup2
QUITE A BIT FROM THE WASHINGTON

01:07:41.824 --> 01:07:45.495 region:rollup2
AND OREGON EXPERIENCE.

01:07:43.660 --> 01:07:46.429 region:rollup2
TYPICALLY THE A BR WASHINGTON

01:07:45.495 --> 01:07:48.164 region:rollup2
PHYSICIANS HAVE BEEN VERY

01:07:46.429 --> 01:07:50.133 region:rollup2
GENEROUS ACROSS THE STATE WITH

01:07:48.164 --> 01:07:52.135 region:rollup2
OTHER GROUPS AS WELL SO WE ALSO

01:07:50.133 --> 01:07:54.137 region:rollup2
USE THE COCKTAIL FOR MEDICATIONS

01:07:52.135 --> 01:07:55.772 region:rollup2
WHICH INCLUDE BENZODIAZEPINE

01:07:54.137 --> 01:07:59.008 region:rollup2
OPIATES AND THEN. TO OTHER

01:07:55.772 --> 01:08:01.110 region:rollup2
MEDICATIONS ARE AS WELL.

01:07:59.008 --> 01:08:02.045 region:rollup2
YEAH AND THAT DOUBTS CLOSER TO

01:08:01.110 --> 01:08:03.580 region:rollup2
ABOUT A FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR COST

01:08:02.045 --> 01:08:04.847 region:rollup2
TIA.

01:08:03.580 --> 01:08:06.749 region:rollup2
SO THAT THAT CUTS THE COST

01:08:04.847 --> 01:08:09.552 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANTLY INTENSE SEEM TO BE

01:08:06.749 --> 01:08:12.322 region:rollup2
VERY. EFFECTIVE.

01:08:09.552 --> 01:08:14.424 region:rollup2
I'M.

01:08:12.322 --> 01:08:16.292 region:rollup2
OKAY THAT MISTER IRVING. YEAH

01:08:14.424 --> 01:08:18.595 region:rollup2
YOU RUN KEEP TELL US ABOUT THAT

01:08:16.292 --> 01:08:20.596 region:rollup2
A BIT ABOUT WHAT GOT PATIENT

01:08:18.595 --> 01:08:22.131 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCES LIKE WHEN THEY TAKE

01:08:20.596 --> 01:08:22.999 region:rollup2
THAT MEDICATION FROM.

01:08:22.131 --> 01:08:24.534 region:rollup2
.

01:08:22.999 --> 01:08:26.369 region:rollup2
THE ONES THAT I'VE

01:08:24.534 --> 01:08:29.739 region:rollup2
GOTTEN THE KIND OF DIRECT

01:08:26.369 --> 01:08:32.141 region:rollup2
DESCRIPTION OF HOW IT'S IT'S SO.

01:08:29.739 --> 01:08:33.509 region:rollup2
HAPPENED IS THAT WHAT THEY THEY

01:08:32.141 --> 01:08:36.312 region:rollup2
DRINK A SLURRY OF THE

01:08:33.509 --> 01:08:37.413 region:rollup2
MEDICATIONS AND WITHIN.

01:08:36.312 --> 01:08:39.415 region:rollup2
BUT LESS THAN FIVE MINUTES THEY

01:08:37.413 --> 01:08:42.018 region:rollup2
LOSE CONSCIOUSNESS.

01:08:39.415 --> 01:08:43.086 region:rollup2
AND THEN THEY ARE REMAIN

01:08:42.018 --> 01:08:44.921 region:rollup2
UNCONSCIOUS UNTIL THEY STOP

01:08:43.086 --> 01:08:47.423 region:rollup2
BREATHING WHICH.

01:08:44.921 --> 01:08:49.325 region:rollup2
CAN BE VERY QUICK IT CAN BE A

01:08:47.423 --> 01:08:51.294 region:rollup2
HALF HOUR WE JUST HAD A PATIENT

01:08:49.325 --> 01:08:53.129 region:rollup2
RECENTLY TAKEN AND TOOK A CLOSER

01:08:51.294 --> 01:08:55.031 region:rollup2
TO TWENTY FOUR HOURS BEFORE THEY

01:08:53.129 --> 01:08:57.166 region:rollup2
STOP BREATHING AND DIED. SO THAT

01:08:55.031 --> 01:08:58.801 region:rollup2
THAT TIME FRAME IS HIGHLY

01:08:57.166 --> 01:09:00.903 region:rollup2
UNPREDICTABLE AND VARIABLE.

01:08:58.801 --> 01:09:02.972 region:rollup2
SO WE REALLY TRY TO PREPARE THE

01:09:00.903 --> 01:09:04.540 region:rollup2
FAMILIES FOR THAT.

01:09:02.972 --> 01:09:06.509 region:rollup2
POSSIBILITY THAT THERE'S A

01:09:04.540 --> 01:09:07.310 region:rollup2
VARIABLE TIME FRAME IN IN THAT

01:09:06.509 --> 01:09:08.911 region:rollup2
EXTENDED DEATH.

01:09:07.310 --> 01:09:10.546 region:rollup2
.

01:09:08.911 --> 01:09:11.814 region:rollup2
THE PATIENT STILL FELL ASLEEP

01:09:10.546 --> 01:09:13.016 region:rollup2
ABOUT FIVE MINUTES AND THEN TO

01:09:11.814 --> 01:09:15.151 region:rollup2
VERY GRACIOUSLY FOR THOSE TWENTY

01:09:13.016 --> 01:09:16.886 region:rollup2
FOUR HOURS YEAH AND THAT AND

01:09:15.151 --> 01:09:18.554 region:rollup2
WHAT WHAT IS HAPPENING.

01:09:16.886 --> 01:09:21.057 region:rollup2
TO THE BODY DURING THAT PERIOD.

01:09:18.554 --> 01:09:22.492 region:rollup2
.

01:09:21.057 --> 01:09:23.893 region:rollup2
THEY'RE THEY'RE BREATHING JUST

01:09:22.492 --> 01:09:26.195 region:rollup2
GRADUALLY SLOWS.

01:09:23.893 --> 01:09:27.897 region:rollup2
IN HIS CASE BECAUSE IT WAS SO

01:09:26.195 --> 01:09:30.466 region:rollup2
MANY HOURS.

01:09:27.897 --> 01:09:33.069 region:rollup2
HE WAS EXHIBITING A LITTLE BIT

01:09:30.466 --> 01:09:34.103 region:rollup2
OF GRIMACING WHICH MAY BE DUMB.

01:09:33.069 --> 01:09:36.072 region:rollup2
PERCEIVED AS POSSIBLY A LITTLE

01:09:34.103 --> 01:09:37.874 region:rollup2
BIT OF.

01:09:36.072 --> 01:09:40.376 region:rollup2
AGITATION OR DISTRESS AND SO THE

01:09:37.874 --> 01:09:42.745 region:rollup2
FAMILY HAD BEEN PREPARED TO TO

01:09:40.376 --> 01:09:43.346 region:rollup2
GIVE THEM SOME SUB SUBLINGUAL.

01:09:42.745 --> 01:09:44.914 region:rollup2
APPEAR IN A BENZODIAZEPINE TO

01:09:43.346 --> 01:09:46.516 region:rollup2
TO.

01:09:44.914 --> 01:09:48.117 region:rollup2
.

01:09:46.516 --> 01:09:50.686 region:rollup2
BUT I REALLY VOWED THAT

01:09:48.117 --> 01:09:53.056 region:rollup2
GRIMACING UNTIL HE HE PASSED.

01:09:50.686 --> 01:09:54.857 region:rollup2
THE THE PHYSICIAN THAT CARED

01:09:53.056 --> 01:09:57.593 region:rollup2
FOR HIM AND PRESCRIBED ALL THIS.

01:09:54.857 --> 01:09:58.661 region:rollup2
THOUGHT THAT PERHAPS FOR HIM

01:09:57.593 --> 01:10:00.730 region:rollup2
AND TOOK LONGER BECAUSE HE'D

01:09:58.661 --> 01:10:01.698 region:rollup2
BEEN ON FAIRLY HIGH DOSE OPIATES

01:10:00.730 --> 01:10:04.133 region:rollup2
UP UNTIL THE TIME THAT HE AND

01:10:01.698 --> 01:10:06.769 region:rollup2
JUSTIN THE MEDICATION AND SO. IT

01:10:04.133 --> 01:10:08.237 region:rollup2
JUST YOU KNOW TOOK LONGER

01:10:06.769 --> 01:10:10.239 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE IDEA THAT I'M.

01:10:08.237 --> 01:10:12.575 region:rollup2
TOLERANCE TO THAT THE OP A

01:10:10.239 --> 01:10:14.510 region:rollup2
PORTION OF THE I'M COCKTAIL.

01:10:12.575 --> 01:10:16.212 region:rollup2
IT'S PROLLY MAKE SENSE.

01:10:14.510 --> 01:10:17.914 region:rollup2
BUT I AGREE I'VE BEEN PRESENT

01:10:16.212 --> 01:10:19.048 region:rollup2
SEVERAL TIMES AND ON THE OTHER

01:10:17.914 --> 01:10:20.483 region:rollup2
THING TO NOTE IS THAT THERE'S

01:10:19.048 --> 01:10:22.552 region:rollup2
MEDICATIONS THAT ARE TAKEN IN

01:10:20.483 --> 01:10:24.187 region:rollup2
ADVANCE OF THE SLURRY THAT TO

01:10:22.552 --> 01:10:26.722 region:rollup2
FOR THE PERSON ABLE TO. PULL THE

01:10:24.187 --> 01:10:28.791 region:rollup2
MEDICATIONS AND NOT HAVE THEM.

01:10:26.722 --> 01:10:30.059 region:rollup2
VOMIT THEM OR OR AND ALSO TO

01:10:28.791 --> 01:10:31.394 region:rollup2
HELP THEM MOVE THROUGH THAT GOT

01:10:30.059 --> 01:10:32.995 region:rollup2
SO THEY CAN BE ABSORBED SO

01:10:31.394 --> 01:10:34.330 region:rollup2
THERE'S ACTUALLY TWO ROUNDS OF

01:10:32.995 --> 01:10:37.033 region:rollup2
MEDICATIONS.

01:10:34.330 --> 01:10:39.569 region:rollup2
AGAIN SIMILARLY WE PREPARE THE

01:10:37.033 --> 01:10:41.137 region:rollup2
FAMILY TO DO PALLIATIVE CARE IF

01:10:39.569 --> 01:10:42.905 region:rollup2
IT TAKES LONGER THE QUIRK

01:10:41.137 --> 01:10:43.506 region:rollup2
WASHINGTON AND OREGON PHYSICIANS

01:10:42.905 --> 01:10:44.640 region:rollup2
THINK UP TO TWENTY FOUR HOURS

01:10:43.506 --> 01:10:47.009 region:rollup2
IS.

01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:49.178 region:rollup2
A IS WITHIN RANGE AND AND AND

01:10:47.009 --> 01:10:51.514 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY MOST CASES ARE IN IN

01:10:49.178 --> 01:10:53.516 region:rollup2
HOURS RATHER THAN MANY HOURS.

01:10:51.514 --> 01:10:53.716 region:rollup2
SO I WOULD AGREE WITH THAT WITH

01:10:53.516 --> 01:10:56.652 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:10:53.716 --> 01:10:58.187 region:rollup2
AND MOST OF US STAY IN CONTACT

01:10:56.652 --> 01:11:00.523 region:rollup2
WITH THE FAMILY DURING THE TIME

01:10:58.187 --> 01:11:03.860 region:rollup2
PRETTY CLOSELY BAH BYE BY PHONE

01:11:00.523 --> 01:11:05.561 region:rollup2
OR IN PERSON.

01:11:03.860 --> 01:11:07.296 region:rollup2
YET MISTER STONEMAN AND DOCTOR

01:11:05.561 --> 01:11:08.831 region:rollup2
QUIRK.

01:11:07.296 --> 01:11:10.333 region:rollup2
BACK UP TO THAT THE ACCESS

01:11:08.831 --> 01:11:11.334 region:rollup2
ISSUES ONE OF THE INTERESTING

01:11:10.333 --> 01:11:12.502 region:rollup2
THINGS AS WE ARE GOING TO THE

01:11:11.334 --> 01:11:13.903 region:rollup2
END OF LIFE OBSCENE ACT IN

01:11:12.502 --> 01:11:15.838 region:rollup2
TRYING TO SORT OUT.

01:11:13.903 --> 01:11:17.240 region:rollup2
SO LIABILITY QUESTIONS THAT THAT

01:11:15.838 --> 01:11:18.241 region:rollup2
WE ANSWERED IN THERE THE WHOLE

01:11:17.240 --> 01:11:20.009 region:rollup2
NOTION OF.

01:11:18.241 --> 01:11:21.778 region:rollup2
PROGNOSIS

01:11:20.009 --> 01:11:24.714 region:rollup2
CAME OUT BECAUSE IT'S AN INEXACT

01:11:21.778 --> 01:11:26.349 region:rollup2
SCIENCE WE BUILT IN WHAT WE DID

01:11:24.714 --> 01:11:27.950 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THE POLITICS OF IT SO

01:11:26.349 --> 01:11:30.686 region:rollup2
YOUR EXPERIENCE.

01:11:27.950 --> 01:11:32.021 region:rollup2
AND YOUR TESTIMONY AND HOW IT'S

01:11:30.686 --> 01:11:34.090 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY OPERATING I THINK WILL

01:11:32.021 --> 01:11:36.058 region:rollup2
BE VERY HELPFUL FOR US AS WE TRY

01:11:34.090 --> 01:11:37.627 region:rollup2
AND FIGURE OUT. NEXT STEPS OF

01:11:36.058 --> 01:11:39.862 region:rollup2
THEIR ARCTIC STEPS TO BE ABLE TO

01:11:37.627 --> 01:11:41.464 region:rollup2
ADDRESS THIS MY QUESTION THOUGH

01:11:39.862 --> 01:11:41.931 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY OF EITHER VIEW HAD

01:11:41.464 --> 01:11:43.166 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE OR KNOW OF

01:11:41.931 --> 01:11:44.767 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE.

01:11:43.166 --> 01:11:45.835 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT CAME

01:11:44.767 --> 01:11:47.370 region:rollup2
UP WITH THE CONCERNS THAT CAME

01:11:45.835 --> 01:11:50.139 region:rollup2
UP WAS FROM THE DISABILITY

01:11:47.370 --> 01:11:52.041 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY. WHO ARE BARRED FROM

01:11:50.139 --> 01:11:53.409 region:rollup2
BEING ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF

01:11:52.041 --> 01:11:55.411 region:rollup2
THIS BECAUSE THEY CANNOT

01:11:53.409 --> 01:11:56.245 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY TAKE THE MEDICATION

01:11:55.411 --> 01:11:58.147 region:rollup2
THEMSELVES AND YOU BROUGHT UP

01:11:56.245 --> 01:12:00.550 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE?

01:11:58.147 --> 01:12:02.485 region:rollup2
THE REASONS THAT PEOPLE ARE ARE

01:12:00.550 --> 01:12:04.353 region:rollup2
DYING OR EVEN SOMEONE WHO HAS

01:12:02.485 --> 01:12:05.988 region:rollup2
OTHER UNRELATED DISABILITIES WHO

01:12:04.353 --> 01:12:07.590 region:rollup2
IS DYING GOING THROUGH MEETS ALL

01:12:05.988 --> 01:12:09.725 region:rollup2
THE CRITERIA.

01:12:07.590 --> 01:12:11.194 region:rollup2
BUT FOR THE ABILITY TO TAKE THE

01:12:09.725 --> 01:12:12.829 region:rollup2
MEDICATION THEMSELVES HAVE YOU

01:12:11.194 --> 01:12:14.530 region:rollup2
HAD.

01:12:12.829 --> 01:12:16.566 region:rollup2
DISABLED FOLKS ASK ABOUT THIS

01:12:14.530 --> 01:12:18.100 region:rollup2
AND AND.

01:12:16.566 --> 01:12:19.268 region:rollup2
BEEN DENIED THE ABILITY BECAUSE

01:12:18.100 --> 01:12:20.970 region:rollup2
OF THE RESTRICTIONS WERE PUT IN

01:12:19.268 --> 01:12:23.239 region:rollup2
THE IN THE LAW.

01:12:20.970 --> 01:12:25.508 region:rollup2
YES I I RECALL ONE PATIENT

01:12:23.239 --> 01:12:26.909 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR THAT WAS.

01:12:25.508 --> 01:12:28.878 region:rollup2
I WENT THROUGH. HORRIBLE

01:12:26.909 --> 01:12:30.947 region:rollup2
DISTRESS OVER THIS HE HAD A

01:12:28.878 --> 01:12:32.481 region:rollup2
NARROW DEGENERATIVE DISORDER.

01:12:30.947 --> 01:12:35.351 region:rollup2
SIMILAR TO A ALAS AND YOU KNOW

01:12:32.481 --> 01:12:36.953 region:rollup2
UNTREATABLE AND HE AT THE POINT

01:12:35.351 --> 01:12:38.588 region:rollup2
THAT HE CAME TO ME HE ONLY HAD

01:12:36.953 --> 01:12:40.089 region:rollup2
USE OF ONE HAND. HE WAS

01:12:38.588 --> 01:12:42.358 region:rollup2
OTHERWISE PRETTY MUCH COMPLETELY

01:12:40.089 --> 01:12:45.027 region:rollup2
PARALYZED HE CAN STILL SWALLOW.

01:12:42.358 --> 01:12:45.795 region:rollup2
AND HE WAS IN PAIN ALL THE TIME

01:12:45.027 --> 01:12:48.030 region:rollup2
HE WAS BED BOUND.

01:12:45.795 --> 01:12:49.131 region:rollup2
.

01:12:48.030 --> 01:12:50.533 region:rollup2
BUT AT THAT POINT IN TIME HIS

01:12:49.131 --> 01:12:52.268 region:rollup2
NEUROLOGIST WAS ADAMANT THAT HE

01:12:50.533 --> 01:12:53.603 region:rollup2
WAS.

01:12:52.268 --> 01:12:56.672 region:rollup2
IT CERTAINLY DID.

01:12:53.603 --> 01:12:58.040 region:rollup2
DISABLED BUT STABLE.

01:12:56.672 --> 01:12:59.709 region:rollup2
AND HE DID NOT BELIEVE THAT

01:12:58.040 --> 01:13:00.776 region:rollup2
THIS PATIENT WOULD DIE IN THE

01:12:59.709 --> 01:13:02.345 region:rollup2
NEXT SIX MONTHS BUT

01:13:00.776 --> 01:13:03.880 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATELY HE MIGHT LOSE THE

01:13:02.345 --> 01:13:05.181 region:rollup2
USE OF HIS HAND IN THE NEXT SIX

01:13:03.880 --> 01:13:06.215 region:rollup2
MONTHS SO. THIS CREATED A

01:13:05.181 --> 01:13:07.950 region:rollup2
HORRIBLE DISTRESS FOR THIS

01:13:06.215 --> 01:13:09.252 region:rollup2
PATIENT.

01:13:07.950 --> 01:13:10.419 region:rollup2
WHO A LIKE I SAID GOT GOT

01:13:09.252 --> 01:13:13.055 region:rollup2
TRAPPED IN THAT?

01:13:10.419 --> 01:13:15.191 region:rollup2
GROUP.

01:13:13.055 --> 01:13:16.425 region:rollup2
I'VE I'VE HAD TO ONE THAT WANT

01:13:15.191 --> 01:13:19.695 region:rollup2
ONE WAY AND ONE WENT TOGETHER

01:13:16.425 --> 01:13:20.830 region:rollup2
I'M I HAD SOMEBODY WHO ON IT WE

01:13:19.695 --> 01:13:23.432 region:rollup2
EXPAND THIS TO THE ETHICS

01:13:20.830 --> 01:13:24.800 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE A PERSON WHO IF. DOT

01:13:23.432 --> 01:13:26.269 region:rollup2
WHO WAS NO LONGER ABLE TO

01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:28.604 region:rollup2
SWALLOW BUT COULD TAKE THE

01:13:26.269 --> 01:13:29.372 region:rollup2
MEDICATIONS THROUGH THE G. TO.

01:13:28.604 --> 01:13:33.509 region:rollup2
AND.

01:13:29.372 --> 01:13:36.245 region:rollup2
IF SHE DIDN'T EAT IF SHE DIDN'T

01:13:33.509 --> 01:13:36.812 region:rollup2
EAT OR DRINK SHE WOULD DIE AND

01:13:36.245 --> 01:13:38.180 region:rollup2
SET THEM THEN THEN YOU'RE

01:13:36.812 --> 01:13:39.749 region:rollup2
ALLOWED TO DO THAT BY LAW YOU

01:13:38.180 --> 01:13:40.216 region:rollup2
CAN STOP EATING AND DRINKING

01:13:39.749 --> 01:13:41.484 region:rollup2
IT'S A WAY OF REFUSING

01:13:40.216 --> 01:13:43.352 region:rollup2
TREATMENT.

01:13:41.484 --> 01:13:45.254 region:rollup2
AND THE QUESTION WAS IT COULD

01:13:43.352 --> 01:13:46.989 region:rollup2
YOU ALSO DO WITH THIS.

01:13:45.254 --> 01:13:49.258 region:rollup2
IF YOU'D REFUSE TO WERE NOT

01:13:46.989 --> 01:13:49.892 region:rollup2
ABLE TO HAVE THAT TREATMENT THAT

01:13:49.258 --> 01:13:50.793 region:rollup2
WOULD ALLOW YOU TO EAT AND DRINK

01:13:49.892 --> 01:13:52.528 region:rollup2
TO YOU HOW

01:13:50.793 --> 01:13:54.263 region:rollup2
TO BE E. EVEN DRINK THROUGH THE

01:13:52.528 --> 01:13:56.666 region:rollup2
TUBE. AND THE ETHICS COMMITTEE

01:13:54.263 --> 01:13:59.235 region:rollup2
SAID OUGHT KNOWS THAT YOU DO YOU

01:13:56.666 --> 01:14:00.736 region:rollup2
DO YOU CAN ACTUALLY DO THAT IN

01:13:59.235 --> 01:14:02.605 region:rollup2
THIS PARTICULAR PERSON'S CASE I

01:14:00.736 --> 01:14:04.607 region:rollup2
WAS ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT

01:14:02.605 --> 01:14:05.975 region:rollup2
DEPRESSION AND. AS IT TURNSOUT

01:14:04.607 --> 01:14:07.610 region:rollup2
WHEN WE WERE ABLE TO TREAT

01:14:05.975 --> 01:14:08.911 region:rollup2
DEPRESSION WE WERE ABLE TO.

01:14:07.610 --> 01:14:10.680 region:rollup2
ISSUES THAT SHE MADE A

01:14:08.911 --> 01:14:11.714 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT DECISION FOR HERSELF

01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:13.149 region:rollup2
AND IT'S JUST A REMINDER HOW

01:14:11.714 --> 01:14:14.717 region:rollup2
CRUCIAL IT IS FOR SOMEONE TO BE

01:14:13.149 --> 01:14:16.686 region:rollup2
REALLY HEARD IN THEIR IN THEIR

01:14:14.717 --> 01:14:19.055 region:rollup2
PAIN AND THEIR SUFFERING. THEIR

01:14:16.686 --> 01:14:20.323 region:rollup2
DEFINITION OF SUFFERING NOT MY

01:14:19.055 --> 01:14:22.525 region:rollup2
DEFINITION OF SUFFERING.

01:14:20.323 --> 01:14:25.661 region:rollup2
I'M SO THAT'S A CASE WHERE THE

01:14:22.525 --> 01:14:28.331 region:rollup2
PERSON ON A WAS DISABLED AND ARE

01:14:25.661 --> 01:14:29.932 region:rollup2
IN THEIR OWN IN THEIR OWN WAY.

01:14:28.331 --> 01:14:31.267 region:rollup2
I HAD TO HAVE SUCH A CASE WHERE

01:14:29.932 --> 01:14:33.169 region:rollup2
SOMEONE THERE WAS CONCERN ABOUT

01:14:31.267 --> 01:14:34.403 region:rollup2
COERCION.

01:14:33.169 --> 01:14:36.272 region:rollup2
AND I WANT TO APPRECIATE THE

01:14:34.403 --> 01:14:38.774 region:rollup2
IMPORTANCE OF.

01:14:36.272 --> 01:14:40.376 region:rollup2
ATTEMPTING THE LIVES OF DISABLED

01:14:38.774 --> 01:14:41.043 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WHO MAY BECAUSE THEY'RE

01:14:40.376 --> 01:14:42.712 region:rollup2
NOT BE IT MAY BE BECAUSE THEY'RE

01:14:41.043 --> 01:14:44.380 region:rollup2
NOT HONORED APPRECIATED OR

01:14:42.712 --> 01:14:46.349 region:rollup2
WHATEVER SOCIETAL REASONS THAT

01:14:44.380 --> 01:14:48.250 region:rollup2
ARE HAPPENING. THAT THEY MAY

01:14:46.349 --> 01:14:49.452 region:rollup2
FEEL THAT THEY HAVE NO TREATMENT

01:14:48.250 --> 01:14:51.253 region:rollup2
OPTIONS OR ACTUALLY AREN'T OFFER

01:14:49.452 --> 01:14:54.123 region:rollup2
TREATMENT OPTIONS AND THAT THE

01:14:51.253 --> 01:14:56.425 region:rollup2
LAW IS INTENDED TO PROTECT.

01:14:54.123 --> 01:14:58.361 region:rollup2
FOR THAT AS WELL WITH TWO PEOPLE

01:14:56.425 --> 01:15:00.496 region:rollup2
MAKING THE DETERMINATION OF SIX

01:14:58.361 --> 01:15:02.098 region:rollup2
MONTHS OR LESS AND AT A JUDGMENT

01:15:00.496 --> 01:15:02.765 region:rollup2
THE A QUICK JUDGEMENT TO SEE

01:15:02.098 --> 01:15:04.266 region:rollup2
WHETHER NOT WE SHOULD BE DOING

01:15:02.765 --> 01:15:05.835 region:rollup2
SOMETHING ELSE TO INTERVENE AND

01:15:04.266 --> 01:15:16.579 region:rollup2
SOCIAL WORKER BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE

01:15:05.835 --> 01:15:18.781 region:rollup2
OR PSYCHIATRY. DOT HAD SOMEBODY

01:15:16.579 --> 01:15:20.282 region:rollup2
AND AND IT WAS ACTUALLY.

01:15:18.781 --> 01:15:21.884 region:rollup2
LISTENING CAREFULLY TO THE

01:15:20.282 --> 01:15:23.219 region:rollup2
DISABILITY COMMUNITY HAS SOME

01:15:21.884 --> 01:15:24.553 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE REASONS I FEEL LIKE.

01:15:23.219 --> 01:15:26.689 region:rollup2
THE AMOUNT OF BARRIERS THAT WE

01:15:24.553 --> 01:15:28.624 region:rollup2
HAVE NOW WHILE ONEROUS FOR SOME

01:15:26.689 --> 01:15:30.626 region:rollup2
ARE NECESSARY FOR SOME AS WELL

01:15:28.624 --> 01:15:32.628 region:rollup2
AND I'M ON BOARD WITH THEM AND

01:15:30.626 --> 01:15:34.397 region:rollup2
AND I. WOULD COMMENT I DO LIKE

01:15:32.628 --> 01:15:35.998 region:rollup2
THE FACT THAT THE LAW MANDATES

01:15:34.397 --> 01:15:37.233 region:rollup2
AT LEAST ONE CONVERSATION WITH

01:15:35.998 --> 01:15:37.900 region:rollup2
THE PATIENT ALONE WHICH I THINK

01:15:37.233 --> 01:15:39.602 region:rollup2
IS

01:15:37.900 --> 01:15:41.404 region:rollup2
VERY IMPORTANT AND KIND OF IN A

01:15:39.602 --> 01:15:43.139 region:rollup2
BUSY CLINIC.

01:15:41.404 --> 01:15:44.407 region:rollup2
IT MIGHT BE EASY TO FORGET TO DO

01:15:43.139 --> 01:15:46.342 region:rollup2
THAT SO I LIKE THAT IT'S BUILT

01:15:44.407 --> 01:15:47.643 region:rollup2
THEM LIKE OKAY I'VE GOT TO DO

01:15:46.342 --> 01:15:49.578 region:rollup2
THIS I'VE GOT A HOUSE THE FAMILY

01:15:47.643 --> 01:15:51.414 region:rollup2
LEAVE BEEN. AND IN EVERY CASE

01:15:49.578 --> 01:15:52.782 region:rollup2
I'VE HAD WHERE I'VE DONE THAT I

01:15:51.414 --> 01:15:53.916 region:rollup2
I FELT MUCH BETTER THIS YA GOTTA

01:15:52.782 --> 01:15:55.618 region:rollup2
MELONES THIS REALLY WHAT YOU

01:15:53.916 --> 01:15:56.986 region:rollup2
WANT AND. YOU KNOW I FELT VERY

01:15:55.618 --> 01:15:58.487 region:rollup2
ASSURED THAT THIS WAS REALLY

01:15:56.986 --> 01:15:59.522 region:rollup2
BEING DRIVEN BY THEM AND NOT

01:15:58.487 --> 01:16:00.756 region:rollup2
THEIR FAMILY BECAUSE SOME OF

01:15:59.522 --> 01:16:02.758 region:rollup2
THESE PATIENTS BECAUSE THEY'VE

01:16:00.756 --> 01:16:05.694 region:rollup2
BEEN SO ILL. AND DEBILITATED FOR

01:16:02.758 --> 01:16:07.029 region:rollup2
SO LONG FAMILY MEMBERS STEP IN

01:16:05.694 --> 01:16:08.364 region:rollup2
AND THEY BECOME THE.

01:16:07.029 --> 01:16:09.098 region:rollup2
COMMUNICATOR FOR THEM AND THEY

01:16:08.364 --> 01:16:11.100 region:rollup2
COME AND THEY WANT TO DO ALL

01:16:09.098 --> 01:16:12.635 region:rollup2
TALKING AND YOU KNOW PRETTY SOON

01:16:11.100 --> 01:16:14.570 region:rollup2
THE PATIENT'S KINDA LOST WHERE

01:16:12.635 --> 01:16:15.771 region:rollup2
THEY'VE THEY'VE HANDED THIS.

01:16:14.570 --> 01:16:17.239 region:rollup2
ROLL OVER TO THEIR FAMILY

01:16:15.771 --> 01:16:18.474 region:rollup2
MEMBERS AT SOMETHING LIKE THIS

01:16:17.239 --> 01:16:19.909 region:rollup2
ONE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE

01:16:18.474 --> 01:16:21.477 region:rollup2
NOT DRIVING AT THAT IT IS FROM

01:16:19.909 --> 01:16:23.913 region:rollup2
THE PATIENT.

01:16:21.477 --> 01:16:24.447 region:rollup2
IT AND WE WERE VERY COGNIZANT OF

01:16:23.913 --> 01:16:30.519 region:rollup2
THAT BUT THERE ARE CERTAIN

01:16:24.447 --> 01:16:32.354 region:rollup2
PEOPLE

01:16:30.519 --> 01:16:34.123 region:rollup2
WITH DISABILITIES WHO WOULD

01:16:32.354 --> 01:16:35.091 region:rollup2
OTHERWISE QUALIFY BUT WON'T AND

01:16:34.123 --> 01:16:38.027 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE EXPRESSED SOME

01:16:35.091 --> 01:16:40.196 region:rollup2
FRUSTRATION. WITH THE NOTION OF

01:16:38.027 --> 01:16:41.397 region:rollup2
COURSE AND THEN AND PEOPLE

01:16:40.196 --> 01:16:44.633 region:rollup2
DISABILITIES IN THEIR ADVOCATES

01:16:41.397 --> 01:16:46.402 region:rollup2
REALLY DO UNDERSTAND THIS THAT

01:16:44.633 --> 01:16:47.837 region:rollup2
THERE ARE SOME OF THE SUCH%

01:16:46.402 --> 01:16:49.472 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATELY WHO ARE GETTING

01:16:47.837 --> 01:16:50.039 region:rollup2
THE MESSAGE FROM THEIR FAMILY

01:16:49.472 --> 01:16:50.606 region:rollup2
YOU WOULD WE WOULD BE BETTER

01:16:50.039 --> 01:16:51.540 region:rollup2
OFF.

01:16:50.606 --> 01:16:52.975 region:rollup2
IF YOU MADE THIS DECISION WHICH

01:16:51.540 --> 01:16:53.976 region:rollup2
IS EXACTLY WHAT WE DON'T WANT

01:16:52.975 --> 01:16:55.845 region:rollup2
THROUGH THIS PROCESS AND

01:16:53.976 --> 01:16:57.913 region:rollup2
BUILDING IN. CHECKS AND BALANCES

01:16:55.845 --> 01:16:59.348 region:rollup2
BUT AS WE LEARNED ABOUT IT IN

01:16:57.913 --> 01:17:03.185 region:rollup2
FOR POLICY MAKERS STANDPOINT.

01:16:59.348 --> 01:17:06.288 region:rollup2
ZIP TO BE UNDERSTANDING OF. THE.

01:17:03.185 --> 01:17:07.957 region:rollup2
THOSE NUANCES AND INSURING THAT

01:17:06.288 --> 01:17:09.925 region:rollup2
THE PROGRAM WILL BE SUCCESSFUL

01:17:07.957 --> 01:17:11.627 region:rollup2
THAT WERE.

01:17:09.925 --> 01:17:13.596 region:rollup2
ABSOLUTELY OF WINNIE ANY

01:17:11.627 --> 01:17:15.064 region:rollup2
COERCION OR ANY OTHER DECISION

01:17:13.596 --> 01:17:17.166 region:rollup2
ALONG THAT LINE. BUT STILL

01:17:15.064 --> 01:17:17.800 region:rollup2
ENSURING THAT PEOPLE WHO.

01:17:17.166 --> 01:17:20.035 region:rollup2
NEED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE WHO WANTS

01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:21.437 region:rollup2
TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS AS AN

01:17:20.035 --> 01:17:24.006 region:rollup2
OPTION AND EVEN IF IT'S JUST THE

01:17:21.437 --> 01:17:25.374 region:rollup2
PEACE OF MIND OPTION. THEN THEY

01:17:24.006 --> 01:17:27.109 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE ABLE TO TO CONSIDER

01:17:25.374 --> 01:17:28.844 region:rollup2
THAT SO WE.

01:17:27.109 --> 01:17:30.713 region:rollup2
WE HAVE A LOT A LOT OF WORK TO

01:17:28.844 --> 01:17:31.814 region:rollup2
DO BUT YOUR EXPERIENCE YOUR

01:17:30.713 --> 01:17:33.582 region:rollup2
TEACHING THE THINGS THAT YOU'RE

01:17:31.814 --> 01:17:35.317 region:rollup2
BRINGING TO US NOW OVER TIME.

01:17:33.582 --> 01:17:37.653 region:rollup2
WILL HELP US SORT THROUGH ALL OF

01:17:35.317 --> 01:17:39.522 region:rollup2
THE CITY RECOMMENDATIONS

01:17:37.653 --> 01:17:40.089 region:rollup2
VERY POOR AND FOREST'S.

01:17:39.522 --> 01:17:41.390 region:rollup2
AND AND ONE ONE THING WE'VE

01:17:40.089 --> 01:17:42.758 region:rollup2
BEEN.

01:17:41.390 --> 01:17:44.193 region:rollup2
RECENTLY DELIBERATING ON BECAUSE

01:17:42.758 --> 01:17:46.729 region:rollup2
OF A PATIENT THEY GOT STALLED

01:17:44.193 --> 01:17:48.063 region:rollup2
BECAUSE SHE CAN GET OUT THE

01:17:46.729 --> 01:17:50.232 region:rollup2
HOUSE TO GET THE UNTIL NEXT

01:17:48.063 --> 01:17:51.567 region:rollup2
APPOINTMENT WAS AND THE LAWS

01:17:50.232 --> 01:17:53.235 region:rollup2
SILENT ON THIS WHETHER. ANY OF

01:17:51.567 --> 01:17:55.304 region:rollup2
THESE VISITS CAN BE DONE VIA

01:17:53.235 --> 01:17:58.007 region:rollup2
TELEMEDICINE.

01:17:55.304 --> 01:17:59.542 region:rollup2
BUT SINCE OF SILENT THAT WE

01:17:58.007 --> 01:18:01.177 region:rollup2
WOULD PRESUME IT'S ALLOWABLE AND

01:17:59.542 --> 01:18:02.444 region:rollup2
WE'RE STARTING TO TALK ABOUT

01:18:01.177 --> 01:18:03.279 region:rollup2
THAT OPTION THAT IF IT.

01:18:02.444 --> 01:18:04.813 region:rollup2
WE PREFER TO HAVE THE PATIENT

01:18:03.279 --> 01:18:07.082 region:rollup2
WITH US

01:18:04.813 --> 01:18:07.917 region:rollup2
BUT IN A CASE WHERE THERE REALLY

01:18:07.082 --> 01:18:09.351 region:rollup2
BED BOUND THIS IS REALLY

01:18:07.917 --> 01:18:11.220 region:rollup2
BURDENSOME COULD WE SET UP YOU

01:18:09.351 --> 01:18:12.922 region:rollup2
KNOW AT LEAST ONE OR TWO OF THE

01:18:11.220 --> 01:18:14.757 region:rollup2
VISITS TO BE VIA TELEMEDICINE

01:18:12.922 --> 01:18:16.692 region:rollup2
AND. AND THAT WOULD TAKE CARE OF

01:18:14.757 --> 01:18:18.527 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE HURDLES THAT

01:18:16.692 --> 01:18:21.730 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES ARISES.

01:18:18.527 --> 01:18:23.566 region:rollup2
TOOK A QUICK.

01:18:21.730 --> 01:18:24.767 region:rollup2
ARE JUST BRIEFLY SECOND ALL I

01:18:23.566 --> 01:18:26.468 region:rollup2
WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT WOULD BE

01:18:24.767 --> 01:18:28.537 region:rollup2
A GENERIC THAT COULD BE

01:18:26.468 --> 01:18:29.672 region:rollup2
MANUFACTURED FAIRLY

01:18:28.537 --> 01:18:31.173 region:rollup2
INEXPENSIVELY Y. ISSUE THREE TO

01:18:29.672 --> 01:18:32.808 region:rollup2
FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS.

01:18:31.173 --> 01:18:34.643 region:rollup2
YOU WOULD HAVE TO ASK THE

01:18:32.808 --> 01:18:37.379 region:rollup2
PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY THAT

01:18:34.643 --> 01:18:39.148 region:rollup2
THERE'S NO REASON. COST WINNER

01:18:37.379 --> 01:18:40.749 region:rollup2
RIGHT AFTER WE PASSED THE ACT

01:18:39.148 --> 01:18:44.920 region:rollup2
MISTER YEAH.

01:18:40.749 --> 01:18:46.288 region:rollup2
YEAH LA ITS PRICE GOUGING

01:18:44.920 --> 01:18:48.090 region:rollup2
SURPRISING NELSON THANK YOU.

01:18:46.288 --> 01:18:49.491 region:rollup2
SO I GUESS AS A RESULT OF MY

01:18:48.090 --> 01:18:51.126 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCES THE CHANGES I WOULD

01:18:49.491 --> 01:18:53.662 region:rollup2
CONSIDER THAT I WOULD LIKE TO

01:18:51.126 --> 01:18:55.197 region:rollup2
SEE. US AGAIN I WAS THAT ONE TO

01:18:53.662 --> 01:18:56.699 region:rollup2
TOUCH ON THE OPTION OF

01:18:55.197 --> 01:18:57.900 region:rollup2
INTRODUCING TELEMEDICINE END OF

01:18:56.699 --> 01:19:00.369 region:rollup2
THIS PROCESS.

01:18:57.900 --> 01:19:02.605 region:rollup2
.

01:19:00.369 --> 01:19:04.073 region:rollup2
I THINK OUR ORGANIZATIONS IN

01:19:02.605 --> 01:19:06.442 region:rollup2
GENERAL PRACTICES IN GENERAL

01:19:04.073 --> 01:19:07.576 region:rollup2
ALSO NEED TO SUPPORT CLINICIANS

01:19:06.442 --> 01:19:10.079 region:rollup2
WHO ARE WILLING TO ENABLE THEM

01:19:07.576 --> 01:19:12.681 region:rollup2
TO BE DOING HOME VISITS.

01:19:10.079 --> 01:19:14.249 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW YOU KNOW MOST ARE

01:19:12.681 --> 01:19:15.651 region:rollup2
PRACTICES JUST DON'T ALLOW YOU

01:19:14.249 --> 01:19:17.186 region:rollup2
THE TIME OF THE LUXURY TO GO TO

01:19:15.651 --> 01:19:19.188 region:rollup2
SOMEONE'S HOME BUT MANY OF US

01:19:17.186 --> 01:19:20.055 region:rollup2
WOULD BE WILLING TO DO THAT.

01:19:19.188 --> 01:19:22.658 region:rollup2
IF NEEDED.

01:19:20.055 --> 01:19:23.926 region:rollup2
.

01:19:22.658 --> 01:19:26.161 region:rollup2
ALL THE CHALLENGES AROUND

01:19:23.926 --> 01:19:28.364 region:rollup2
HOSPICE NON PARTICIPATION TO ME

01:19:26.161 --> 01:19:30.366 region:rollup2
AS CREATIVELY A LOT OF HURDLES

01:19:28.364 --> 01:19:32.468 region:rollup2
FOR THESE PATIENTS SO. I WOULD

01:19:30.366 --> 01:19:33.569 region:rollup2
REALLY ENCOURAGE INCREASED JOB

01:19:32.468 --> 01:19:35.371 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATION BY HOSPICE

01:19:33.569 --> 01:19:37.806 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONS.

01:19:35.371 --> 01:19:39.275 region:rollup2
IF I COULD CHANGE THE LAW. I

01:19:37.806 --> 01:19:41.477 region:rollup2
WOULD CONSIDER REDUCING THE

01:19:39.275 --> 01:19:43.279 region:rollup2
MANDATED FIFTEEN DAY TIMEFRAME

01:19:41.477 --> 01:19:45.514 region:rollup2
BETWEEN ATTENDING VISITS DOWN TO

01:19:43.279 --> 01:19:47.449 region:rollup2
MAYBE SEVEN TO TEN DAYS WHICH.

01:19:45.514 --> 01:19:49.184 region:rollup2
AS I DESCRIBED EARLIER THESE

01:19:47.449 --> 01:19:51.186 region:rollup2
EVERY FEW TWO TO THREE DAYS

01:19:49.184 --> 01:19:53.222 region:rollup2
ADDED DELAYS FOR THESE PATIENTS

01:19:51.186 --> 01:19:54.356 region:rollup2
CAN SOMETIMES BE EXCRUCIATING.

01:19:53.222 --> 01:19:55.824 region:rollup2
AND I DON'T THINK THERE WOULD BE

01:19:54.356 --> 01:19:59.395 region:rollup2
A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A TEN

01:19:55.824 --> 01:20:00.429 region:rollup2
VERSES A FIFTEEN DAY TIME FRAME.

01:19:59.395 --> 01:20:01.997 region:rollup2
AND THEN CONSIDERING THE

01:20:00.429 --> 01:20:04.566 region:rollup2
POSSIBILITY OF EXTENDING THE

01:20:01.997 --> 01:20:05.334 region:rollup2
PROGNOSIS FROM LESS THAN SIX

01:20:04.566 --> 01:20:07.302 region:rollup2
MONTHS TO ANNOUNCE LESS THAN

01:20:05.334 --> 01:20:08.137 region:rollup2
TWELVE MONTHS.

01:20:07.302 --> 01:20:08.671 region:rollup2
TO TO ALLOW SOME THESE OTHER

01:20:08.137 --> 01:20:12.574 region:rollup2
VERY SUFFERING PATIENTS.

01:20:08.671 --> 01:20:15.844 region:rollup2
ACCESS.

01:20:12.574 --> 01:20:17.079 region:rollup2
SO. IN CLOSING.

01:20:15.844 --> 01:20:19.214 region:rollup2
I RECOGNIZE THE NEED TO HAVE

01:20:17.079 --> 01:20:22.618 region:rollup2
PARAMETERS LIMITATIONS TO THE

01:20:19.214 --> 01:20:23.619 region:rollup2
PRACTICES OBEYED AND DYING. A

01:20:22.618 --> 01:20:25.421 region:rollup2
WILL NEVER WILL LIKELY NEVER

01:20:23.619 --> 01:20:27.056 region:rollup2
ACHIEVE A PERFECT BALANCE

01:20:25.421 --> 01:20:29.258 region:rollup2
BETWEEN THESE TWO.

01:20:27.056 --> 01:20:30.859 region:rollup2
DESPITE SUCH CHALLENGES I

01:20:29.258 --> 01:20:32.795 region:rollup2
FIRMLY BELIEVE ALLOWING AID IN

01:20:30.859 --> 01:20:34.930 region:rollup2
DYING IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT

01:20:32.795 --> 01:20:36.999 region:rollup2
DIRECTION TO SUPPORT PATIENT

01:20:34.930 --> 01:20:38.767 region:rollup2
SELF DETERMINATION AND AUTONOMY

01:20:36.999 --> 01:20:41.603 region:rollup2
IN THEIR OWN CARE SO. THANK YOU

01:20:38.767 --> 01:20:42.838 region:rollup2
AGAIN FOR ALLOWING US TO COME.

01:20:41.603 --> 01:20:44.807 region:rollup2
THANK YOU BOTH FOR YOUR

01:20:42.838 --> 01:20:47.009 region:rollup2
TESTIMONY CLEARLY WE COULD TALK

01:20:44.807 --> 01:20:48.777 region:rollup2
TO YOU ALL DAY. AND IT'S ABOUT

01:20:47.009 --> 01:20:50.879 region:rollup2
MY NO FOR ALL OF US FASCINATING

01:20:48.777 --> 01:20:52.381 region:rollup2
OR HOME FASTENINGS WERE BUT.

01:20:50.879 --> 01:20:54.383 region:rollup2
THERE WAS SO I MEAN THERE WERE.

01:20:52.381 --> 01:20:56.919 region:rollup2
SO MUCH NEGOTIATING AND AND

01:20:54.383 --> 01:20:59.421 region:rollup2
DIALOGUE AROUND. EVERY PIECE OF

01:20:56.919 --> 01:21:01.190 region:rollup2
POLICY WE SET UP SODA TO BE ABLE

01:20:59.421 --> 01:21:01.523 region:rollup2
TO HEAR. HOW IT WE HOW IT WORKS

01:21:01.190 --> 01:21:04.793 region:rollup2
IN REAL LIFE?

01:21:01.523 --> 01:21:07.062 region:rollup2
?

01:21:04.793 --> 01:21:07.896 region:rollup2
IS I MEAN IT IT IT IS BRINGS A

01:21:07.062 --> 01:21:08.731 region:rollup2
FULL CIRCLE FOR POLICY MAKERS

01:21:07.896 --> 01:21:10.899 region:rollup2
AND SEE THEN HOW WE CAN IMPROVE

01:21:08.731 --> 01:21:12.234 region:rollup2
IT. GOING FORWARD I COMPLETE MY

01:21:10.899 --> 01:21:13.469 region:rollup2
DISSERTATION IN TWO THOUSAND TWO

01:21:12.234 --> 01:21:14.870 region:rollup2
ONE AND OF LIFE AND AT THAT TIME

01:21:13.469 --> 01:21:16.572 region:rollup2
WHEN THE BIG TAKEAWAYS WAS WE

01:21:14.870 --> 01:21:17.973 region:rollup2
REALLY NEEDED TO HAVE A LOT MORE

01:21:16.572 --> 01:21:20.209 region:rollup2
CONVERSATIONS WITH PHYSICIANS

01:21:17.973 --> 01:21:22.678 region:rollup2
AND ANY TRAININGS. A AROUND AND

01:21:20.209 --> 01:21:23.579 region:rollup2
OF LIFE AND HOW WE HOW WE TALK

01:21:22.678 --> 01:21:26.048 region:rollup2
ABOUT THAT.

01:21:23.579 --> 01:21:28.217 region:rollup2
SO IT'S GOOD TO SEE IS MOVING

01:21:26.048 --> 01:21:30.285 region:rollup2
ALONG AND I THINK I I HERE YOU

01:21:28.217 --> 01:21:31.787 region:rollup2
GO ST CAN STILL MOVE MORE BUT I

01:21:30.285 --> 01:21:35.457 region:rollup2
THINK HOPEFULLY WITH THE PASSAGE

01:21:31.787 --> 01:21:36.759 region:rollup2
OF THIS. IT ALSO JUST PROVIDES A

01:21:35.457 --> 01:21:40.496 region:rollup2
ONE MORE IMPETUS FOR US TO HAVE

01:21:36.759 --> 01:21:41.864 region:rollup2
FULL DIALOGUES AROUND WHAT ARE

01:21:40.496 --> 01:21:42.598 region:rollup2
OPTIONS AND OF LIFE.

01:21:41.864 --> 01:21:44.533 region:rollup2
THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH FOR

01:21:42.598 --> 01:21:46.468 region:rollup2
YOUR THINK THINK YOU I JUST WANT

OUR POLICY.

01:26:02.824 --> 01:26:07.195 region:rollup2
OUR OUR WORK FLOW ALSO INVOLVES

01:27:36.651 --> 01:27:39.254 region:rollup2
SUCCESSORS AND THEN A FEW

01:27:38.954 --> 01:27:41.323 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES.

01:27:39.254 --> 01:27:43.191 region:rollup2
.

01:27:41.323 --> 01:27:44.559 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF SUCCESSES IT IN OUR

01:27:43.191 --> 01:27:46.428 region:rollup2
EARLY DISCUSSIONS IN THE HOUSE

01:27:44.559 --> 01:27:48.230 region:rollup2
SYSTEM IT WAS.

01:27:46.428 --> 01:27:49.798 region:rollup2
FELT TO BE A VERY IMPORTANT

01:27:48.230 --> 01:27:51.566 region:rollup2
POSITION AID IN DYING AS AN

01:27:49.798 --> 01:27:52.200 region:rollup2
OPTION OF LAST RESORT.

01:27:51.566 --> 01:27:54.336 region:rollup2
AND THAT.

01:27:52.200 --> 01:27:55.470 region:rollup2
DOT LANGUAGE ACTUALLY COMES

01:27:54.336 --> 01:27:57.239 region:rollup2
FROM THE AFFECTS LITERATURE IN

01:27:55.470 --> 01:27:58.673 region:rollup2
THE PALETTE OF CARE LITERATURE

01:27:57.239 --> 01:27:59.941 region:rollup2
THAT LOOKS AT AS DOCTOR SEAT

01:27:58.673 --> 01:28:01.109 region:rollup2
ACROSS SHOOTER CHRIS MENTIONED

01:27:59.941 --> 01:28:02.811 region:rollup2
EARLIER THAT.

01:28:01.109 --> 01:28:04.346 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY SAYS THAT IN MOST

01:28:02.811 --> 01:28:05.547 region:rollup2
CASES HIGH QUALITY PALETTE OF

01:28:04.346 --> 01:28:07.883 region:rollup2
CARE IS EFFECTIVE.

01:28:05.547 --> 01:28:09.251 region:rollup2
AT ALLEVIATING THE SUFFERING

01:28:07.883 --> 01:28:09.885 region:rollup2
WHICH MIGHT OTHERWISE PRINT

01:28:09.251 --> 01:28:12.587 region:rollup2
SOMEONE TO PURSUE AN EIGHT AND

01:28:09.885 --> 01:28:12.788 region:rollup2
NINE DRUG. BUT NOT IN ALL CASES

01:28:12.587 --> 01:28:14.589 region:rollup2
AND.

01:28:12.788 --> 01:28:16.191 region:rollup2
SO THE IDEA FOR US

01:28:14.589 --> 01:28:17.659 region:rollup2
INSTITUTIONALLY IS THAT IF WE'RE

01:28:16.191 --> 01:28:18.426 region:rollup2
GOING TO PARTICIPATE IN THE US

01:28:17.659 --> 01:28:20.595 region:rollup2
AND WE NEED TO DO SO IN THE

01:28:18.426 --> 01:28:22.697 region:rollup2
CONTEXT WHERE PATIENTS HAVE GOOD

01:28:20.595 --> 01:28:24.432 region:rollup2
ACCESS TO ARMS. RETAIN ON THE

01:28:22.697 --> 01:28:24.1000 region:rollup2
FLIGHT CARE. AND THE EVIDENCE

01:28:24.432 --> 01:28:26.368 region:rollup2
THAT WE'VE BEEN SUCCESSFUL

01:28:24.1000 --> 01:28:27.636 region:rollup2
WITHOUT ISN'T ALL OF OUR

01:28:26.368 --> 01:28:29.604 region:rollup2
QUALIFIED PATIENTS HAVE BEEN

01:28:27.636 --> 01:28:31.907 region:rollup2
ENROLLED IN EITHER HOSPICE OR

01:28:29.604 --> 01:28:32.474 region:rollup2
I'M A SIMILAR PROGRAM THAT'S

01:28:31.907 --> 01:28:33.508 region:rollup2
CALLED HOME BASE PALETTE OF

01:28:32.474 --> 01:28:34.276 region:rollup2
CARE.

01:28:33.508 --> 01:28:35.877 region:rollup2
SO I WOULD CONSIDER THAT A

01:28:34.276 --> 01:28:37.412 region:rollup2
SUCCESS.

01:28:35.877 --> 01:28:38.914 region:rollup2
AND WE'VE ALSO BEEN QUITE

01:28:37.412 --> 01:28:40.715 region:rollup2
SUCCESSFUL IN MY VIEW WITH

01:28:38.914 --> 01:28:41.950 region:rollup2
EDUCATIONAL OUTREACH WHICH ARM

01:28:40.715 --> 01:28:43.485 region:rollup2
AS MENTIONED EARLIER IS A REAL

01:28:41.950 --> 01:28:45.787 region:rollup2
CHALLENGE. WE'VE.

01:28:43.485 --> 01:28:47.255 region:rollup2
DIDN'T THIS IS LARGELY FALLEN

01:28:45.787 --> 01:28:48.190 region:rollup2
UNDER MY RESPONSIBILITY BUT

01:28:47.255 --> 01:28:51.026 region:rollup2
WE'VE CREATEDTO.

01:28:48.190 --> 01:28:53.061 region:rollup2
CME SESSIONS AND ON OUTREACH TO

01:28:51.026 --> 01:28:54.963 region:rollup2
NEARLY ALL PHYSICIANS IN OUR IN

01:28:53.061 --> 01:28:57.632 region:rollup2
OUR HOUSE SYSTEM.

01:28:54.963 --> 01:28:59.668 region:rollup2
AND WE'VE ALSO DONE ARE SIMILAR

01:28:57.632 --> 01:29:01.236 region:rollup2
EDUCATIONAL OUTREACH TO SEVERAL

01:28:59.668 --> 01:29:03.205 region:rollup2
OF THE FELLOWSHIP IN RESIDENCY

01:29:01.236 --> 01:29:04.739 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS.

01:29:03.205 --> 01:29:04.940 region:rollup2
WITH ALSO AND CREATED A THREE

01:29:04.739 --> 01:29:06.508 region:rollup2
HOUR.

01:29:04.940 --> 01:29:08.210 region:rollup2
.

01:29:06.508 --> 01:29:10.712 region:rollup2
STANDARDIZED PATIENT BASED

01:29:08.210 --> 01:29:12.614 region:rollup2
DIDACTIC FOR MEDICAL STUDENTS

01:29:10.712 --> 01:29:13.715 region:rollup2
ARE ALL MEDICAL STUDENTS TECH

01:29:12.614 --> 01:29:15.250 region:rollup2
THAT LAST YEAR AND WERE DOING

01:29:13.715 --> 01:29:15.984 region:rollup2
THE NEXT ONE THIS YEAR IN A FEW

01:29:15.250 --> 01:29:17.752 region:rollup2
WEEKS.

01:29:15.984 --> 01:29:19.254 region:rollup2
AND WE'VE ALSO DONE SOME OUT

01:29:17.752 --> 01:29:21.122 region:rollup2
RICH WITH OTHER NON PHYSICIAN

01:29:19.254 --> 01:29:22.524 region:rollup2
GROUPS AND OUR HOUSE SYSTEM TO

01:29:21.122 --> 01:29:23.758 region:rollup2
HELP IMPROVE THEIR EDUCATION

01:29:22.524 --> 01:29:26.328 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE LAW. AND US ABOUT OUR

01:29:23.758 --> 01:29:27.762 region:rollup2
POLICY.

01:29:26.328 --> 01:29:30.131 region:rollup2
THE LAST THING I WOULD SAY.

01:29:27.762 --> 01:29:30.932 region:rollup2
WHICH I'M I'M PARTICULARLY

01:29:30.131 --> 01:29:33.001 region:rollup2
PROUD OF IS THAT I THINK WE'VE

01:29:30.932 --> 01:29:35.270 region:rollup2
BEEN EFFECTIVE IN LEVERAGING

01:29:33.001 --> 01:29:36.872 region:rollup2
INTEREST AND THIS LAW.

01:29:35.270 --> 01:29:39.407 region:rollup2
TO.

01:29:36.872 --> 01:29:41.042 region:rollup2
CREATE EXPANDED ACCESS TO

01:29:39.407 --> 01:29:41.543 region:rollup2
PALLIATIVE CARE.

01:29:41.042 --> 01:29:43.011 region:rollup2
AND THERE'S THERE'S AN

01:29:41.543 --> 01:29:45.013 region:rollup2
INTERESTING PARALLEL

01:29:43.011 --> 01:29:47.482 region:rollup2
INSTITUTIONALLY ARMS TO WHAT

01:29:45.013 --> 01:29:48.917 region:rollup2
HAPPENS ARE IN THE CLINIC.

01:29:47.482 --> 01:29:50.285 region:rollup2
WHAT WHAT WE TELL PROVIDERS IS

01:29:48.917 --> 01:29:52.554 region:rollup2
THAT WHEN A PATIENT ASKS YOU

01:29:50.285 --> 01:29:54.289 region:rollup2
ABOUT THIS LAW?

01:29:52.554 --> 01:29:56.224 region:rollup2
OFTEN THAT QUESTION IS

01:29:54.289 --> 01:29:57.626 region:rollup2
UNDIFFERENTIATED THAT REALLY

01:29:56.224 --> 01:29:59.060 region:rollup2
ASKING YOU FOR HELP

01:29:57.626 --> 01:30:00.595 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING WHAT'S GONNA

01:29:59.060 --> 01:30:03.031 region:rollup2
HAPPEN TO THEM AND WHAT. HOW

01:30:00.595 --> 01:30:05.300 region:rollup2
THEIR DISEASE WILL PROGRESS WHAT

01:30:03.031 --> 01:30:07.269 region:rollup2
SYMPTOMS MAY EMERGE HOW THEY GET

01:30:05.300 --> 01:30:08.536 region:rollup2
THE SUPPORT THAT THEY NEED?

01:30:07.269 --> 01:30:10.438 region:rollup2
AND SHOW THAT THAT'S A THAT'S

01:30:08.536 --> 01:30:12.240 region:rollup2
NOT AN UNFAMILIAR QUESTION FOR A

01:30:10.438 --> 01:30:15.410 region:rollup2
PALETTE OF CARE PROVIDER. AND

01:30:12.240 --> 01:30:16.811 region:rollup2
THE IDEAS THAT FROM DOWN THE

01:30:15.410 --> 01:30:19.347 region:rollup2
INTEREST AND THE END OF LIFE

01:30:16.811 --> 01:30:20.749 region:rollup2
OPTION ACT YOU ARE ABLE TO HAVE

01:30:19.347 --> 01:30:22.951 region:rollup2
A VERY BROAD AND TERADYNE

01:30:20.749 --> 01:30:23.485 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION WITH THE PATIENT. IN

01:30:22.951 --> 01:30:24.886 region:rollup2
THE SAME THING'S HAPPENING

01:30:23.485 --> 01:30:25.220 region:rollup2
INSTITUTIONALLY

01:30:24.886 --> 01:30:27.522 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THE.

01:30:25.220 --> 01:30:28.323 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE AND AND AND THE

01:30:27.522 --> 01:30:30.091 region:rollup2
PUBLIC ARE TELLING US THAT THEY

01:30:28.323 --> 01:30:32.694 region:rollup2
WANT ACCESS TO THIS OPTION WE'VE

01:30:30.091 --> 01:30:33.295 region:rollup2
USE THAT TO LEVERAGE HAN.

01:30:32.694 --> 01:30:34.763 region:rollup2
A GREATER ACCESS TO PALLET OF

01:30:33.295 --> 01:30:35.697 region:rollup2
CARE.

01:30:34.763 --> 01:30:37.465 region:rollup2
THE EVIDENCE FOR THAT IS THAT

01:30:35.697 --> 01:30:39.100 region:rollup2
ARMOR HOUSE SYSTEM MADE A VERY

01:30:37.465 --> 01:30:41.002 region:rollup2
LARGE INVESTMENT AND.

01:30:39.100 --> 01:30:42.804 region:rollup2
EXPANDING PALETTE OF CARE INTO

01:30:41.002 --> 01:30:45.240 region:rollup2
OUR PRIVATE CARE NETWORKS AND TO

01:30:42.804 --> 01:30:46.474 region:rollup2
THE CANCER CENTER ARM AND ALSO

01:30:45.240 --> 01:30:48.543 region:rollup2
ARE SOME STAFFING IMPROVEMENTS A

01:30:46.474 --> 01:30:49.110 region:rollup2
PALETTE OF CARE IN THE HOSPITAL

01:30:48.543 --> 01:30:50.712 region:rollup2
AND I DON'T THINK THOSE ARE

01:30:49.110 --> 01:30:53.315 region:rollup2
COINCIDENTAL.

01:30:50.712 --> 01:30:54.949 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF CHALLENGES ARMED.

01:30:53.315 --> 01:30:55.517 region:rollup2
THEY ARE OUT HOW POINT OUT TO

01:30:54.949 --> 01:30:58.086 region:rollup2
VERY BRIEFLY BECAUSE I THINK

01:30:55.517 --> 01:30:58.720 region:rollup2
THERE WERE ALL OF US WOULD

01:30:58.086 --> 01:30:59.988 region:rollup2
PROBABLY AGREE THESE ARE ISSUES

01:30:58.720 --> 01:31:01.523 region:rollup2
ON.

01:30:59.988 --> 01:31:01.990 region:rollup2
PHYSICIAN PARTICIPATION IS LOW

01:31:01.523 --> 01:31:04.993 region:rollup2
AND.

01:31:01.990 --> 01:31:06.428 region:rollup2
THAT PRESENTS A CHALLENGE HAS

01:31:04.993 --> 01:31:07.696 region:rollup2
DOCTOR SEAT A QUEST NIGHTFORCE

01:31:06.428 --> 01:31:09.431 region:rollup2
MENTIONED WHEN A PATIENT MAKES A

01:31:07.696 --> 01:31:10.765 region:rollup2
REQUEST TO A DOCTOR WHO KNOWS

01:31:09.431 --> 01:31:13.034 region:rollup2
THEM BUT HAS CHOSEN NOT TO

01:31:10.765 --> 01:31:14.936 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATE. WE'VE HAD TO.

01:31:13.034 --> 01:31:16.738 region:rollup2
COME UP WITH THAT AN EFFICIENT

01:31:14.936 --> 01:31:19.240 region:rollup2
PROCESS TO GET THOSE PATIENTS

01:31:16.738 --> 01:31:20.508 region:rollup2
QUICKLY REFERRED TO

01:31:19.240 --> 01:31:22.577 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATING PROVIDERS.

01:31:20.508 --> 01:31:24.045 region:rollup2
AND ON IN THE SAME VEIN WE'VE

01:31:22.577 --> 01:31:25.714 region:rollup2
HAD TO PAY ATTENTION TO HOW TO

01:31:24.045 --> 01:31:27.315 region:rollup2
SUPPORT THOSE PROVIDERS

01:31:25.714 --> 01:31:29.718 region:rollup2
SO THAT THEIR PRACTICE ISN'T

01:31:27.315 --> 01:31:32.087 region:rollup2
EXCLUSIVELY ENRICHED IN.

01:31:29.718 --> 01:31:34.155 region:rollup2
IN END OF LIFE OPTION ACT.

01:31:32.087 --> 01:31:35.590 region:rollup2
QUERIES.

01:31:34.155 --> 01:31:36.057 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S BEEN ON CHALLENGE HOW

01:31:35.590 --> 01:31:37.692 region:rollup2
TO DO THAT THE OTHER.

01:31:36.057 --> 01:31:39.194 region:rollup2
.

01:31:37.692 --> 01:31:41.830 region:rollup2
THE OTHER HAS CHALLENGE HAS BEEN

01:31:39.194 --> 01:31:42.897 region:rollup2
THAT WE'VE FOUND THAT THIS.

01:31:41.830 --> 01:31:43.765 region:rollup2
PROCESS REQUIRES A LOT OF

01:31:42.897 --> 01:31:46.401 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT.

01:31:43.765 --> 01:31:48.737 region:rollup2
.

01:31:46.401 --> 01:31:50.372 region:rollup2
IT AND IN SOME RARE CASES AT THE

01:31:48.737 --> 01:31:52.674 region:rollup2
PATIENT.

01:31:50.372 --> 01:31:54.876 region:rollup2
THEMSELF.

01:31:52.674 --> 01:31:56.111 region:rollup2
HAS THE RESOURCES TO SORT OF

01:31:54.876 --> 01:31:58.179 region:rollup2
SUPPLY THAT MANAGEMENT THEY'RE

01:31:56.111 --> 01:31:59.647 region:rollup2
FEELING WELL ENOUGH AND THAT GOT

01:31:58.179 --> 01:32:01.116 region:rollup2
HIGH HEALTH LITERACY THEY'RE

01:31:59.647 --> 01:32:03.151 region:rollup2
VERY EFFECTIVE ADVOCATES AND

01:32:01.116 --> 01:32:04.853 region:rollup2
THEY CAN PUSH ON TO GET THROUGH

01:32:03.151 --> 01:32:06.921 region:rollup2
THE STEPS IN THE PROCESS. IN

01:32:04.853 --> 01:32:07.589 region:rollup2
OTHER CASES OF POSITION MIGHT BE

01:32:06.921 --> 01:32:09.057 region:rollup2
MOTIVATED.

01:32:07.589 --> 01:32:11.326 region:rollup2
TO PROVIDE SOME OF THAT

01:32:09.057 --> 01:32:13.161 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT BUT IN MOST CASES IT

01:32:11.326 --> 01:32:14.996 region:rollup2
REQUIRES A LOT OF WORK ARE BY

01:32:13.161 --> 01:32:15.497 region:rollup2
THE PATIENT NAVIGATOR. ARM TO

01:32:14.996 --> 01:32:18.566 region:rollup2
HELP.

01:32:15.497 --> 01:32:19.134 region:rollup2
SHEPHERD THE PROCESS ALONG AND

01:32:18.566 --> 01:32:22.637 region:rollup2
I THINK.

01:32:19.134 --> 01:32:23.038 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT IT REQUIRES THAT

01:32:22.637 --> 01:32:25.440 region:rollup2
MUCH MANAGEMENT.

01:32:23.038 --> 01:32:26.841 region:rollup2
REPRESENTS A POSSIBILITY THAT

01:32:25.440 --> 01:32:29.911 region:rollup2
THERE WILL BE SOME ISSUES AND

01:32:26.841 --> 01:32:32.647 region:rollup2
FAIRNESS AND ACCESS WHICH WE

01:32:29.911 --> 01:32:35.150 region:rollup2
WERE ALLUDED TO EARLIER SNOW.

01:32:32.647 --> 01:32:38.153 region:rollup2
AND THINK FOR MY TIME AND BE

01:32:35.150 --> 01:32:39.254 region:rollup2
HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS.

01:32:38.153 --> 01:32:40.321 region:rollup2
I THINK WE'LL WE'LL HEAR FROM

01:32:39.254 --> 01:32:41.623 region:rollup2
EVERY PERSON IN AND THEN GO BACK

01:32:40.321 --> 01:32:42.157 region:rollup2
I THINK YOU VERY MUCH.

01:32:41.623 --> 01:32:44.392 region:rollup2
THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND

WE'RE DOING AT UCLA RELATED TO

01:32:52.801 --> 01:32:55.537 region:rollup2
HOW DIFFERENT HEALTH SYSTEMS

01:32:54.002 --> 01:32:58.173 region:rollup2
ACROSS THE STATE HAVE RESPONDED

01:32:55.537 --> 01:32:59.307 region:rollup2
TO THE END OF LIFE OPTION ACT.

01:32:58.173 --> 01:33:00.308 region:rollup2

01:33:02.410 --> 01:33:04.813 region:rollup2
FOUNDATION.

01:33:03.678 --> 01:33:07.715 region:rollup2
AND THE STOP SKI FOUNDATION FOR

01:33:04.813 --> 01:33:08.917 region:rollup2
THEIR SUPPORT IN THIS RESEARCH.

01:33:07.715 --> 01:33:10.618 region:rollup2
SO WHILE THE END OF LIFE OPTION

01:33:08.917 --> 01:33:11.686 region:rollup2
ACT MADE PHYSICIAN AID IN DYING

01:33:10.618 --> 01:33:13.555 region:rollup2
LEGALLY AVAILABLE TO

01:33:11.686 --> 01:33:14.856 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIANS THE LAW ALSO ALLOWS

01:33:13.555 --> 01:33:16.124 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS AND HEALTH CARE

01:33:14.856 --> 01:33:17.325 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS TO CHOOSE NOT TO

01:33:16.124 --> 01:33:18.993 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATE.

01:33:17.325 --> 01:33:20.562 region:rollup2
SO SOME HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS HAVE

01:33:18.993 --> 01:33:22.597 region:rollup2
DECIDED NOT TO PROVIDE PHYSICIAN

01:33:20.562 --> 01:33:24.165 region:rollup2
AID IN DYING AT ALL OR IN SOME

01:33:22.597 --> 01:33:26.568 region:rollup2
CASES EVEN NOT ENGAGE IN

01:33:24.165 --> 01:33:28.269 region:rollup2
DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE OPTION.

01:33:26.568 --> 01:33:29.437 region:rollup2
OTHERS HAVE DECIDED TO PROVIDE

01:33:28.269 --> 01:33:31.406 region:rollup2
THE OPTION UNDER SPECIFIC

01:33:29.437 --> 01:33:32.607 region:rollup2
CIRCUMSTANCES AND DEFINE THOSE

01:33:31.406 --> 01:33:34.742 region:rollup2
CIRCUMSTANCES AND PROCESS SEASON

01:33:32.607 --> 01:33:35.977 region:rollup2
A VARIETY OF WAYS. AND STILL

01:33:34.742 --> 01:33:38.379 region:rollup2
OTHERS HAVE DECIDED TO LEAVE THE

01:33:35.977 --> 01:33:40.348 region:rollup2
DECISIONS ENTIRELY UP TO

01:33:38.379 --> 01:33:41.449 region:rollup2
PHYSICIANS ABOUT IF THEY WILL

01:33:40.348 --> 01:33:42.584 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATE AND WHAT

01:33:41.449 --> 01:33:44.586 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTATION LOOKS LIKE FOR

01:33:42.584 --> 01:33:45.954 region:rollup2
THEM.

01:33:44.586 --> 01:33:47.422 region:rollup2
WE CURRENTLY DO NOT HAVE

01:33:45.954 --> 01:33:48.490 region:rollup2
ADEQUATE ESTIMATES OF THE

01:33:47.422 --> 01:33:50.058 region:rollup2
PROPORTION OF HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS

01:33:48.490 --> 01:33:52.060 region:rollup2
THAT HAVE ADOPTED EACH OF THESE

01:33:50.058 --> 01:33:53.828 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT STRATEGIES. AND AS A

01:33:52.060 --> 01:33:55.330 region:rollup2
PRACTICAL MATTER THE DECISIONS

01:33:53.828 --> 01:33:57.098 region:rollup2
AT THE ORGANIZATIONS MAKE

01:33:55.330 --> 01:33:58.399 region:rollup2
INFLUENCE THE KINDS OF DECISIONS

01:33:57.098 --> 01:33:59.467 region:rollup2
THAT PATIENTS CAN MAKE AND

01:33:58.399 --> 01:34:01.503 region:rollup2
ULTIMATELY INFLUENCE THESE

01:33:59.467 --> 01:34:03.638 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS OF ACCESS.

01:34:01.503 --> 01:34:05.507 region:rollup2
SO UCLA WE ARE CURRENTLY

01:34:03.638 --> 01:34:07.075 region:rollup2
CONDUCTING AN ASUS A SYSTEM

01:34:05.507 --> 01:34:08.743 region:rollup2
SURVEYS SO WE'VE DESIGNED A

01:34:07.075 --> 01:34:10.812 region:rollup2
SURVEY OF HEALTH SYSTEMS ACROSS

01:34:08.743 --> 01:34:12.480 region:rollup2
THE STATE. WE WANT TO UNDERSTAND

01:34:10.812 --> 01:34:14.649 region:rollup2
HOW MANY OF THE SYSTEMS HOW OF

01:34:12.480 --> 01:34:17.352 region:rollup2
POLICIES IN PLACE AND WHAT THOSE

01:34:14.649 --> 01:34:18.887 region:rollup2
POLICIES INCLUDE AND WHAT THOSE

01:34:17.352 --> 01:34:20.054 region:rollup2
POLICIES DON'T INCLUDE.

01:34:18.887 --> 01:34:22.223 region:rollup2
WE'RE CURRENTLY IN THE MIDDLE OF

01:34:20.054 --> 01:34:23.458 region:rollup2
THE DATA COLLECTION STAGE AND SO

01:34:22.223 --> 01:34:25.693 region:rollup2
FORMAL RESULTS FROM THIS

01:34:23.458 --> 01:34:27.328 region:rollup2
ANALYSIS WILL BE. A AVAILABLE

01:34:25.693 --> 01:34:28.796 region:rollup2
ONCE THE DATA COLLECTION AND

01:34:27.328 --> 01:34:30.832 region:rollup2
ANALYSIS IS COMPLETE.

01:34:28.796 --> 01:34:32.934 region:rollup2
BUT WE DO HAVE A FEW INITIAL.

01:34:30.832 --> 01:34:34.269 region:rollup2
IMPRESSIONS THAT WE THINK MAY

01:34:32.934 --> 01:34:35.236 region:rollup2
INFORM SOME OF THESE QUESTIONS

01:34:34.269 --> 01:34:37.205 region:rollup2
ABOUT IMPLEMENTATION OF THE END

01:34:35.236 --> 01:34:38.773 region:rollup2
OF LIFE OPTION THAT.

01:34:37.205 --> 01:34:40.508 region:rollup2
SO MANY OF THESE THINGS YOU'VE

01:34:38.773 --> 01:34:41.309 region:rollup2
HEARD FROM OTHERS SPEAKERS TODAY

01:34:40.508 --> 01:34:42.477 region:rollup2
AND I'M SURE YOU'LL HEAR

01:34:41.309 --> 01:34:43.745 region:rollup2
THROUGHOUT THE DAY.

01:34:42.477 --> 01:34:45.113 region:rollup2
SO I'D LIKE TO REAFFIRM THE

01:34:43.745 --> 01:34:47.081 region:rollup2
IMPORTANCE OF OF SOME OF THESE

01:34:45.113 --> 01:34:49.284 region:rollup2
POINTS. SO FIRST VERY LITTLE

01:34:47.081 --> 01:34:51.219 region:rollup2
PUBLIC INFORMATION EXISTS ABOUT

01:34:49.284 --> 01:34:53.087 region:rollup2
HOW DIFFERENT HOLE SYSTEMS HAVE

01:34:51.219 --> 01:34:54.989 region:rollup2
CREATED POLICIES AND WHAT THOSE

01:34:53.087 --> 01:34:56.157 region:rollup2
POLICIES INCLUDE. SO BECAUSE OF

01:34:54.989 --> 01:34:57.692 region:rollup2
THIS IT'S LIKELY DIFFICULT FOR

01:34:56.157 --> 01:34:59.861 region:rollup2
PATIENTS TO KNOW IF THERE

01:34:57.692 --> 01:35:01.396 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS WOULD BE ABLE TO WRITE

01:34:59.861 --> 01:35:02.297 region:rollup2
PRESCRIPTIONS REGARDLESS OF THE

01:35:01.396 --> 01:35:04.032 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL PROVIDERS OWN

01:35:02.297 --> 01:35:05.733 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE.

01:35:04.032 --> 01:35:07.535 region:rollup2
AND EVEN BEYOND ACCESS TO THE

01:35:05.733 --> 01:35:09.537 region:rollup2
OPTION IN TERMS OF IF A POLICY

01:35:07.535 --> 01:35:10.638 region:rollup2
EXISTS OR NOT. WE'VE HEARD FROM

01:35:09.537 --> 01:35:12.307 region:rollup2
SEVERAL PROVIDERS WHO HAVE TAKEN

01:35:10.638 --> 01:35:12.807 region:rollup2
OUR SURVEY ALREADY THAT PATIENTS

01:35:12.307 --> 01:35:15.009 region:rollup2
LACK KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE

01:35:12.807 --> 01:35:16.010 region:rollup2
PROCESS.

01:35:15.009 --> 01:35:18.079 region:rollup2
AND THAT THEY WISH FOR MORE

01:35:16.010 --> 01:35:19.347 region:rollup2
INFORMATION ABOUT IF THE OPTIONS

01:35:18.079 --> 01:35:20.949 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE TO THEM AS WELL AS THE

01:35:19.347 --> 01:35:22.317 region:rollup2
STEPS THAT THEY HAVE TO TAKE.

01:35:20.949 --> 01:35:23.518 region:rollup2
BOTH THE STEPS THAT ARE

01:35:22.317 --> 01:35:24.886 region:rollup2
DETERMINED BY THE LAWS WELLS THE

01:35:23.518 --> 01:35:27.155 region:rollup2
STEPS THAT ARE DETERMINED BY THE

01:35:24.886 --> 01:35:28.389 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONS THEMSELVES.

01:35:27.155 --> 01:35:29.691 region:rollup2
WELL SOME HEALTH SYSTEMS HAVE

01:35:28.389 --> 01:35:30.825 region:rollup2
EXPRESSED CONCERNS ABOUT MAKING

01:35:29.691 --> 01:35:32.927 region:rollup2
THEIR POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

01:35:30.825 --> 01:35:34.395 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC.

01:35:32.927 --> 01:35:36.097 region:rollup2
MANY PROVIDERS HAVE SAID THAT

01:35:34.395 --> 01:35:37.298 region:rollup2
THIS TYPE OF STEP WOULD MAKE IT

01:35:36.097 --> 01:35:39.634 region:rollup2
EASIER FOR PATIENTS TO FIND

01:35:37.298 --> 01:35:40.935 region:rollup2
INFORMATION.

01:35:39.634 --> 01:35:42.770 region:rollup2
MANY HAVE ALSO EXPRESSED LOW

01:35:40.935 --> 01:35:44.239 region:rollup2
THAT THE A CONSOLIDATION OF

01:35:42.770 --> 01:35:45.540 region:rollup2
INFORMATION ABOUT THESE POLICIES

01:35:44.239 --> 01:35:47.342 region:rollup2
ABOUT DIFFERENT APPROACHES NEED

01:35:45.540 --> 01:35:48.910 region:rollup2
TO BE COMING FROM NEUTRAL

01:35:47.342 --> 01:35:51.946 region:rollup2
SOURCES AND INCLUDE THE ENTIRE

01:35:48.910 --> 01:35:52.780 region:rollup2
RANGE OF END OF LIFE APPROACHES.

01:35:51.946 --> 01:35:55.283 region:rollup2
NOT JUST THE END OF LIFE OPTION

01:35:52.780 --> 01:35:58.353 region:rollup2
ACT.

01:35:55.283 --> 01:35:59.654 region:rollup2
pHEARD QUITE A BIT. IS THAT

01:35:58.353 --> 01:36:00.922 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS FROM A DIVERSITY OF

01:35:59.654 --> 01:36:02.523 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONAL SETTINGS HAVE

01:36:00.922 --> 01:36:04.292 region:rollup2
REPORTED THAT WHEN THERE'S A

01:36:02.523 --> 01:36:05.660 region:rollup2
PROVIDER WHO IS NOT WILLING OR

01:36:04.292 --> 01:36:07.362 region:rollup2
ABLE TO WRITE A PRESCRIPTION FOR

01:36:05.660 --> 01:36:09.130 region:rollup2
THE INDICTMENT OCCASIONS. IT'S

01:36:07.362 --> 01:36:11.266 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT TO KNOW WHAT TO DO

01:36:09.130 --> 01:36:12.266 region:rollup2
NEXT FOR THE PATIENTS WHO ARE

01:36:11.266 --> 01:36:14.002 region:rollup2
SURE THAT THIS IS THE RIGHT

01:36:12.266 --> 01:36:15.737 region:rollup2
OPTION FOR THEM.

01:36:14.002 --> 01:36:16.838 region:rollup2
SOME OF PROVIDERS HAVE REQUESTED

01:36:15.737 --> 01:36:18.573 region:rollup2
A DIRECTOR TO DIRECTORY A

01:36:16.838 --> 01:36:19.741 region:rollup2
REPOSITORY OF NAMES A PROVIDERS

01:36:18.573 --> 01:36:21.909 region:rollup2
WHO ARE WILLING TO SERVE AS

01:36:19.741 --> 01:36:23.478 region:rollup2
ATTENDING PHYSICIANS. AND SOME

01:36:21.909 --> 01:36:25.613 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONS HAVE EVEN TRIED TO

01:36:23.478 --> 01:36:27.515 region:rollup2
CREATE SUCH A REPOSITORY.

01:36:25.613 --> 01:36:28.016 region:rollup2
HOWEVER MANY OF THEM HAVE ALSO

01:36:27.515 --> 01:36:29.550 region:rollup2
REPORTED THAT THEY HAVE

01:36:28.016 --> 01:36:31.285 region:rollup2
RESISTANCE FROM PROVIDERS WHO

01:36:29.550 --> 01:36:32.887 region:rollup2
DON'T WANT TO BE KNOWN AS THE

01:36:31.285 --> 01:36:35.189 region:rollup2
AID IN DYING DOCTOR.

01:36:32.887 --> 01:36:36.491 region:rollup2
SO THIS IS A CONTINUING CONCERN.

01:36:35.189 --> 01:36:37.492 region:rollup2
AN ADDITIONAL COMPLICATION FOR

01:36:36.491 --> 01:36:39.527 region:rollup2
KNOWING WHAT TO DO WITH A

01:36:37.492 --> 01:36:40.862 region:rollup2
PATIENT WHO MAKES A REQUEST TO A

01:36:39.527 --> 01:36:43.865 region:rollup2
NON PARTICIPATING PHYSICIAN OUR

01:36:40.862 --> 01:36:45.466 region:rollup2
SYSTEM. IS THAT MANY SYSTEMS WHO

01:36:43.865 --> 01:36:47.068 region:rollup2
ARE PARTICIPATING OR PROVIDERS

01:36:45.466 --> 01:36:48.302 region:rollup2
WHO ARE PARTICIPATING ARE

01:36:47.068 --> 01:36:50.438 region:rollup2
UNWILLING TO TAKE ON PATIENTS

01:36:48.302 --> 01:36:53.374 region:rollup2
SOLELY FOR THE PURPOSE OF USING

01:36:50.438 --> 01:36:54.275 region:rollup2
THE END OF LIFE OPTION ACT.

01:36:53.374 --> 01:36:55.510 region:rollup2
WELL PATIENTS CERTAINLY CAN

01:36:54.275 --> 01:36:57.278 region:rollup2
STILL RECEIVE HIGH QUALITY

01:36:55.510 --> 01:36:59.280 region:rollup2
PALLIATIVE CARE IN END OF LIFE

01:36:57.278 --> 01:37:01.082 region:rollup2
CARE EVEN IN A NON PARTICIPATING

01:36:59.280 --> 01:37:03.017 region:rollup2
SYSTEM WE NEED MORE INFORMATION

01:37:01.082 --> 01:37:05.853 region:rollup2
ABOUT HOW TO EFFECTIVELY AND.

01:37:03.017 --> 01:37:07.021 region:rollup2
SUPPORT PEOPLE IN A TIMELY WAY

01:37:05.853 --> 01:37:09.624 region:rollup2
WHEN THEY'RE SURE THAT THIS IS

01:37:07.021 --> 01:37:10.725 region:rollup2
THE RIGHT OPTION FOR THEM.

01:37:09.624 --> 01:37:12.293 region:rollup2
THE FINAL THING THAT ALL SAY

01:37:10.725 --> 01:37:13.394 region:rollup2
THAT WE'VE LEARNED FROM OUR

01:37:12.293 --> 01:37:14.962 region:rollup2
IMPRESSIONS FROM THE SURVEY IS

01:37:13.394 --> 01:37:16.531 region:rollup2
THAT WHILE MANY ORGANIZATIONS

01:37:14.962 --> 01:37:19.033 region:rollup2
HAVE CONSIDERED HOW TO CREATE

01:37:16.531 --> 01:37:20.435 region:rollup2
INTERNAL PROCESSES FOR HANDLING

01:37:19.033 --> 01:37:21.736 region:rollup2
REQUESTS FOR THE MEDICATIONS.

01:37:20.435 --> 01:37:23.304 region:rollup2
SEVERAL REPORT THAT THEIR

01:37:21.736 --> 01:37:25.273 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES WITH COORDINATING

01:37:23.304 --> 01:37:26.808 region:rollup2
WITH OTHER SETTINGS AND SO THE

01:37:25.273 --> 01:37:28.810 region:rollup2
TWO SETTINGS WE CARE ABOUT MOST

01:37:26.808 --> 01:37:30.111 region:rollup2
OFTEN ARE PHARMACY AND HOSPICE

01:37:28.810 --> 01:37:32.046 region:rollup2
WHICH WE'VE ALREADY TALKED A BIT

01:37:30.111 --> 01:37:33.214 region:rollup2
ABOUT TODAY. OF FINING

01:37:32.046 --> 01:37:34.382 region:rollup2
PHARMACIES THAT WILL FILL THE

01:37:33.214 --> 01:37:35.616 region:rollup2
PRESCRIPTIONS HAS BEEN

01:37:34.382 --> 01:37:37.585 region:rollup2
CHALLENGING FOR MANY OF THE

01:37:35.616 --> 01:37:39.053 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONS ESPECIALLY A

01:37:37.585 --> 01:37:40.254 region:rollup2
COMPOUNDING PHARMACY IS NOT

01:37:39.053 --> 01:37:41.355 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE.

01:37:40.254 --> 01:37:42.890 region:rollup2
AND ADDITIONALLY MOST

01:37:41.355 --> 01:37:44.425 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONS PERFORMER OR EVEN

01:37:42.890 --> 01:37:45.693 region:rollup2
REQUIRE THAT THEIR PATIENTS ARE

01:37:44.425 --> 01:37:47.729 region:rollup2
ENROLLED IN HOSPICE OR

01:37:45.693 --> 01:37:49.330 region:rollup2
PALLIATIVE CARE BUT THEY REPORT

01:37:47.729 --> 01:37:51.332 region:rollup2
THAT THEIR LOCAL HOSPICES ARE

01:37:49.330 --> 01:37:53.034 region:rollup2
UNWILLING OR AND EQUIPPED TO

01:37:51.332 --> 01:37:54.569 region:rollup2
HANDLE THE REQUEST.

01:37:53.034 --> 01:37:56.704 region:rollup2
IN ADDITION THERE CHALLENGES IN

01:37:54.569 --> 01:37:58.706 region:rollup2
TERMS OF PAYMENT MODELS AND

01:37:56.704 --> 01:38:00.208 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING HOW TO DIVIDE UP

01:37:58.706 --> 01:38:00.908 region:rollup2
THE THE LABOR OF CARING FOR

01:38:00.208 --> 01:38:02.310 region:rollup2
PEOPLE.

01:38:00.908 --> 01:38:03.177 region:rollup2
WHEN BOTH HOSPICE AND THE

01:38:02.310 --> 01:38:05.146 region:rollup2
PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS ARE STILL

01:38:03.177 --> 01:38:06.647 region:rollup2
INVOLVED.

01:38:05.146 --> 01:38:07.515 region:rollup2
PATIENTS ARE MOST SUPPORTED IF

01:38:06.647 --> 01:38:09.484 region:rollup2
THESE COORDINATION EFFORTS ARE

01:38:07.515 --> 01:38:12.086 region:rollup2
IMPROVED.

01:38:09.484 --> 01:38:13.454 region:rollup2
SO IN SOME REGARDLESS OF THE

01:38:12.086 --> 01:38:15.056 region:rollup2
HEALTH SYSTEM WERE INDIVIDUAL

01:38:13.454 --> 01:38:16.524 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS OWN POSITION TOWARD

01:38:15.056 --> 01:38:18.392 region:rollup2
THE LA.

01:38:16.524 --> 01:38:19.794 region:rollup2
FROM THIS RESEARCH I BELIEVE

01:38:18.392 --> 01:38:21.396 region:rollup2
THE INFORMATION SHARING AND

01:38:19.794 --> 01:38:23.598 region:rollup2
SUPPORT FOR COORDINATION WOULD

01:38:21.396 --> 01:38:25.400 region:rollup2
REALLY IMPROVE. THAT EXPERIENCE

01:38:23.598 --> 01:38:26.901 region:rollup2

01:44:05.639 --> 01:44:10.744 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATED IN THE PROCESS.

01:44:08.743 --> 01:44:12.079 region:rollup2
SO CONCLUSION IMPLEMENTATION OF

01:44:10.744 --> 01:44:13.981 region:rollup2
THE ACT THAT'S INCREASE THE

01:44:12.079 --> 01:44:15.516 region:rollup2
PROMINENCE OF CONVERSATIONS

01:44:13.981 --> 01:44:16.951 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE END ABOUT END OF LIFE

01:44:15.516 --> 01:44:17.718 region:rollup2
ISSUES AT OUR IN OUR HEALTH

01:44:16.951 --> 01:44:19.820 region:rollup2
SYSTEM.

01:44:17.718 --> 01:44:21.889 region:rollup2
BUT SOME OF THE EFFECTS

01:44:19.820 --> 01:44:22.456 region:rollup2
ACROSS THE STATE. OF WOULD BE

01:44:21.889 --> 01:44:24.825 region:rollup2
BETTER KNOWN IF WE HAD MORE

01:44:22.456 --> 01:44:26.761 region:rollup2
DATA.

01:44:24.825 --> 01:44:28.529 region:rollup2
I'D ADDITIONAL DATA BOTH BEING

01:44:26.761 --> 01:44:28.996 region:rollup2
COLLECTED IN BETTER TRANSPARENCY

01:44:28.529 --> 01:44:31.065 region:rollup2

COLLECTED.

01:44:31.065 --> 01:44:34.135 region:rollup2
BICU SILLY MECHANISM OF

01:44:32.666 --> 01:44:35.536 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTING THIS I THINK

01:44:34.135 --> 01:44:37.972 region:rollup2
DEMONSTRATES THAT THERE'S MUCH

01:44:35.536 --> 01:44:40.508 region:rollup2
UNMET NEED FOR EXPERT HANDS ON

01:44:37.972 --> 01:44:42.176 region:rollup2

01:44:46.747 --> 01:44:51.452 region:rollup2
SORT. HIS CREW IS CONSIDERABLE.

01:44:49.750 --> 01:44:53.587 region:rollup2
BUT PERHAPS MOST IMPORTANTLY

01:44:51.452 --> 01:44:55.990 region:rollup2
THIS LEVEL OF SUPPORT SHOULD NOT

01:44:53.587 --> 01:44:59.960 region:rollup2
BE EXCLUSIVELY AVAIL AVAILABLE

01:44:55.990 --> 01:45:02.797 region:rollup2

OUR COMMITTEE SAID AS OUR

01:46:04.692 --> 01:46:07.628 region:rollup2
NORTHSTAR AND IDEA THAT NO

PATIENT WHATEVER AVAIL

01:46:07.628 --> 01:46:10.998 region:rollup2

THIS WAS THE THING WE REMINDED

01:46:17.238 --> 01:46:21.008 region:rollup2
OURSELVES UP AND ASKED ALL ALONG

01:46:18.906 --> 01:46:23.711 region:rollup2
IF WHAT WE WERE SETTING FORTH

01:46:21.008 --> 01:46:25.145 region:rollup2
WOULD SERVE BACK GOAL. AND I

01:46:23.711 --> 01:46:26.447 region:rollup2
THINK WHAT WE'RE MOST PROUD OF

01:46:25.145 --> 01:46:28.182 region:rollup2
TODAY IS THAT TIME WE'VE BEEN

01:46:26.447 --> 01:46:28.582 region:rollup2

PROGRAMS OR BOTH.

01:46:42.730 --> 01:46:44.265 region:rollup2
AND WE FIND THAT TO BE VERY

01:46:43.297 --> 01:46:46.634 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT.

01:46:44.265 --> 01:46:48.202 region:rollup2

THE STEPS THAT ARE OUTLINED IN

01:48:28.469 --> 01:48:32.106 region:rollup2
THE LAW BUT ACTUALLY ALL THAT IS

EFFECT THAT IT WOULD JUST

01:51:32.886 --> 01:51:34.688 region:rollup2
INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF

WHAT WHAT KINDS OF MORE DATA AND

01:51:43.797 --> 01:51:46.466 region:rollup2

01:51:45.365 --> 01:51:49.336 region:rollup2
TRANSPARENCY THAT CAN YOU TALK A

01:51:46.466 --> 01:51:52.239 region:rollup2
LITTLE ABOUT THAT.

01:51:49.336 --> 01:51:53.907 region:rollup2
SURE SO IN TERMS OF MORE DATA.

01:51:52.239 --> 01:51:56.143 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WOULD BE

01:51:53.907 --> 01:51:58.245 region:rollup2
HELPFUL FOR US IS MORE DATA

01:51:56.143 --> 01:51:59.880 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE RANGE OF.

01:51:58.245 --> 01:52:01.215 region:rollup2
APPROACHES THAT THAT

01:51:59.880 --> 01:52:02.282 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS ARE TAKING WHICH IS PART

01:52:01.215 --> 01:52:03.550 region:rollup2
OF WHAT WE'RE DOING IN THIS MORE

THERE WAS TALKING SPECIFICALLY

01:52:10.257 --> 01:52:13.627 region:rollup2
ABOUT MORE PATIENT.

01:52:12.492 --> 01:52:15.929 region:rollup2
RIGHT SO THEY'RE I THINK THERE'S

01:52:13.627 --> 01:52:16.897 region:rollup2
TWO AREAS WHERE MORE DATA COULD

01:52:15.929 --> 01:52:17.965 region:rollup2

THOSE DATA PUBLISHED.

01:52:27.407 --> 01:52:32.112 region:rollup2

HEARING ABOUT REQUESTS.

01:52:32.112 --> 01:52:36.450 region:rollup2

THERE OUGHT TO BE A WAY FOR US

01:52:39.453 --> 01:52:43.390 region:rollup2
TO COLLECT DATA SIMILAR TO WHAT

01:52:41.488 --> 01:52:44.891 region:rollup2

01:56:36.022 --> 01:56:39.893 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA'S THAT YEAR LATELY

01:56:38.859 --> 01:56:40.760 region:rollup2
WITH MY DAILY WAY CAN ACTUALLY I

01:56:39.893 --> 01:56:41.895 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE THE NUMBERS FOR YOU

01:56:40.760 --> 01:56:43.096 region:rollup2
BUT WHAT I WILL SAY IS THAT WHEN

01:56:41.895 --> 01:56:45.599 region:rollup2
PHYSICIANS MAKE A REFERRAL TO

01:56:43.096 --> 01:56:46.600 region:rollup2
THE PROGRAM. WE ASK THEM IN WHAT

01:56:45.599 --> 01:56:48.068 region:rollup2
WAY ARE THEY WILLING TO

01:56:46.600 --> 01:56:50.203 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATE ARE THEY WILLING TO

01:56:48.068 --> 01:56:52.906 region:rollup2
BE AN ATTENDING PHYSICIAN AT A

01:56:50.203 --> 01:56:53.540 region:rollup2
CONSULTING PHYSICIAN EITHER DO

01:56:52.906 --> 01:56:55.942 region:rollup2
THEY WOULD THEY BE WILLING TO

01:56:53.540 --> 01:56:57.477 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATE WITH MENTORSHIP. AND

01:56:55.942 --> 01:56:58.778 region:rollup2
WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THAT THE

01:56:57.477 --> 01:57:00.914 region:rollup2
VAST MAJORITY OF PHYSICIANS ARE

01:56:58.778 --> 01:57:02.749 region:rollup2
WILLING TO PARTICIPATE IN SOME

01:57:00.914 --> 01:57:05.585 region:rollup2
FASHION.

01:57:02.749 --> 01:57:06.152 region:rollup2
IN IN THOSE VARIOUS AREAS I

01:57:05.585 --> 01:57:07.420 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE THE NUMBERS THINK

01:57:06.152 --> 01:57:10.757 region:rollup2
YOU.

01:57:07.420 --> 01:57:11.591 region:rollup2
IN ONE OF THE CHALLENGES I THINK

01:57:10.757 --> 01:57:12.092 region:rollup2
WE HAVE IS THAT.

01:57:11.591 --> 01:57:13.560 region:rollup2
YOU'RE ALL REPRESENTING

01:57:12.092 --> 01:57:15.061 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATING INSTITUTIONS.

01:57:13.560 --> 01:57:15.629 region:rollup2
AND AS WE ALL UNDERSTAND THE LAW

01:57:15.061 --> 01:57:16.796 region:rollup2
ALLOWS AN INSTITUTION TO OPT

01:57:15.629 --> 01:57:18.198 region:rollup2
OUT.

01:57:16.796 --> 01:57:19.132 region:rollup2
IT DOESN'T REQUIRE ANY POSITION

01:57:18.198 --> 01:57:20.734 region:rollup2
TO PARTICIPATE WHO DOESN'T WANT

01:57:19.132 --> 01:57:22.869 region:rollup2
TO.

01:57:20.734 --> 01:57:25.171 region:rollup2
SOME INSTITUTIONS BECAUSE OF

01:57:22.869 --> 01:57:28.508 region:rollup2
CORE BELIEFS.

01:57:25.171 --> 01:57:30.310 region:rollup2
NAME NOT BE INCLINED TO HELP A

01:57:28.508 --> 01:57:32.579 region:rollup2
PATIENT.

01:57:30.310 --> 01:57:33.179 region:rollup2
FIND A.

01:57:32.579 --> 01:57:35.649 region:rollup2
A PHYSICIAN WHO WOULD BE ABLE

01:57:33.179 --> 01:57:37.484 region:rollup2
TO.

01:57:35.649 --> 01:57:39.552 region:rollup2
FACILITATE THAT NARROW THE SCOPE

01:57:37.484 --> 01:57:40.654 region:rollup2
OF OUR HEARING TODAY BUT IT IS.

01:57:39.552 --> 01:57:41.988 region:rollup2
A BROADER QUESTION OF ACCESS.

01:57:40.654 --> 01:57:42.822 region:rollup2
IN

01:57:41.988 --> 01:57:45.058 region:rollup2
I THINK I'M.

01:57:42.822 --> 01:57:47.260 region:rollup2
.

01:57:45.058 --> 01:57:49.462 region:rollup2
IN IN THE SHARING OF INFORMATION

01:57:47.260 --> 01:57:51.264 region:rollup2
AMONG INSTITUTIONS ó I THINK

01:57:49.462 --> 01:57:53.199 region:rollup2
DOCTOR WHEN YOU RAISE THE ISSUE.

01:57:51.264 --> 01:57:54.801 region:rollup2
OF SOME RETICENCE OF

01:57:53.199 --> 01:57:56.636 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATING POSITIONS TO BE

01:57:54.801 --> 01:57:58.738 region:rollup2
LISTED IN SOME KIND OF A

01:57:56.636 --> 01:58:01.207 region:rollup2
REPOSITORY. I THINK THIS IS

01:57:58.738 --> 01:58:02.008 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT THOSE OF US

01:58:01.207 --> 01:58:02.943 region:rollup2
THEY'RE TRYING TO MOVE FORWARD

01:58:02.008 --> 01:58:04.644 region:rollup2
WITH IMPLEMENTATION.

01:58:02.943 --> 01:58:05.979 region:rollup2
.

01:58:04.644 --> 01:58:07.981 region:rollup2
WE HAVE TRIED TO FIGURE OUT HOW

01:58:05.979 --> 01:58:11.017 region:rollup2
COULD YOU CREATE.

01:58:07.981 --> 01:58:13.053 region:rollup2
A RIPS OPOSITORES IF OF NAMES

01:58:11.017 --> 01:58:15.155 region:rollup2
THAT MAYBE HAS SOME PROTECTIONS

01:58:13.053 --> 01:58:17.190 region:rollup2
FOR CONFIDENTIALITY OR SOME

01:58:15.155 --> 01:58:19.626 region:rollup2
GATEWAYS ON HAVE YOU GIVEN ANY

01:58:17.190 --> 01:58:22.062 region:rollup2
FURTHER THOUGHT ANY OF YOU TO.

01:58:19.626 --> 01:58:24.030 region:rollup2
NO INFORMATION ABOUT.

01:58:22.062 --> 01:58:26.933 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATING PHYSICIANS MIGHT

01:58:24.030 --> 01:58:29.102 region:rollup2
BEACH MIGHT BE SHARED OR MADE

01:58:26.933 --> 01:58:32.572 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE TO PATIENTS OR OTHER

01:58:29.102 --> 01:58:35.241 region:rollup2
POSITIONS. WITHOUT COMPROMISING

01:58:32.572 --> 01:58:35.475 region:rollup2
A DESIRE FOR CONFIDENTIALITY.

01:58:35.241 --> 01:58:37.677 region:rollup2
I MIGHT.

01:58:35.475 --> 01:58:39.112 region:rollup2
.

01:58:37.677 --> 01:58:41.181 region:rollup2
I MIGHT POINT OUT THAT DATES

01:58:39.112 --> 01:58:41.681 region:rollup2
PROBABLY DIFFERENT WITHIN

01:58:41.181 --> 01:58:44.117 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS THEN. OUTSIDE OF

01:58:41.681 --> 01:58:46.686 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS.

01:58:44.117 --> 01:58:49.723 region:rollup2
I WITHIN SYSTEMS WE'RE SEEING

01:58:46.686 --> 01:58:49.990 region:rollup2
AND VERY INTERESTING.

01:58:49.723 --> 01:58:51.458 region:rollup2
APPROACH.

01:58:49.990 --> 01:58:53.693 region:rollup2
.

01:58:51.458 --> 01:58:55.929 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT

01:58:53.693 --> 01:58:57.163 region:rollup2
OVERTIME WHERE I'M NOT MANY

01:58:55.929 --> 01:58:58.264 region:rollup2
PEOPLE MIGHT THINK THAT THE

01:58:57.163 --> 01:58:59.532 region:rollup2
OPPOSITION DECISION TO

01:58:58.264 --> 01:59:01.668 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATE ARE UP NOW

01:58:59.532 --> 01:59:04.371 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATE. IS SOMETHING THAT

01:59:01.668 --> 01:59:06.006 region:rollup2
IS A STRONGLY HELD BELIEF FOR

01:59:04.371 --> 01:59:07.307 region:rollup2
SOME IT IS.

01:59:06.006 --> 01:59:08.508 region:rollup2
BUT FOR THE VAST MAJORITY WHAT

01:59:07.307 --> 01:59:10.710 region:rollup2
WE'RE SAYING IS THAT IT'S

01:59:08.508 --> 01:59:12.612 region:rollup2
DEPENDENTLARGELY ON THE

01:59:10.710 --> 01:59:14.347 region:rollup2
PHYSICIAN PATIENT RELATIONSIP.

01:59:12.612 --> 01:59:15.448 region:rollup2
AND THAT POSITIONS ARE WILLING

01:59:14.347 --> 01:59:16.549 region:rollup2
TO PRESCRIBE UNDER SOME

01:59:15.448 --> 01:59:18.218 region:rollup2
CIRCUMSTANCES BUT NOT UNDER

01:59:16.549 --> 01:59:20.987 region:rollup2
OTHERS.

01:59:18.218 --> 01:59:22.889 region:rollup2
AND IN FACT WITHIN A SYSTEM

01:59:20.987 --> 01:59:24.991 region:rollup2
WHERE THERE IS COMFORT IN THEIR

01:59:22.889 --> 01:59:26.826 region:rollup2
SUPPORT WE'RE SEEING MORE AND

01:59:24.991 --> 01:59:28.695 region:rollup2
MORE PHYSICIANS BEING WILLING TO

01:59:26.826 --> 01:59:30.697 region:rollup2
PRESCRIBE PERHAPS NOT AT THE

01:59:28.695 --> 01:59:32.465 region:rollup2
VERY BEGINNING. AND NOW EIGHTEEN

01:59:30.697 --> 01:59:33.967 region:rollup2
MONTHS AND THEY ARE.

01:59:32.465 --> 01:59:35.068 region:rollup2
BOB AND WE'RE ALSO SEEING THAT

01:59:33.967 --> 01:59:35.769 region:rollup2
THEY'RE COORDINATING AMONG

01:59:35.068 --> 01:59:37.971 region:rollup2
THEMSELVES WITHIN THEIR

01:59:35.769 --> 01:59:39.372 region:rollup2
SPECIALTY.

01:59:37.971 --> 01:59:41.474 region:rollup2
SO FOR INSTANCE MANY OF OUR OWN

01:59:39.372 --> 01:59:43.376 region:rollup2
ONCOLOGISTS ARE PRESCRIBING NOW

01:59:41.474 --> 01:59:44.144 region:rollup2
THEY WEREN'T ORIGINALLY.

01:59:43.376 --> 01:59:46.046 region:rollup2
AND THEY.

01:59:44.144 --> 01:59:48.214 region:rollup2
HAVE ARRANGED TO BE ABLE TO

01:59:46.046 --> 01:59:50.150 region:rollup2
CONSULT FOR EACH OTHER TO MAKE

01:59:48.214 --> 01:59:51.918 region:rollup2
SURE THAT PATIENTS ARE ARE ABLE

INSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURES THAT

02:00:00.527 --> 02:00:05.098 region:rollup2
PROVIDE SUPPORT IN MULTI

02:00:02.295 --> 02:00:08.234 region:rollup2
DISCIPLINARY COOPERATION IN.

CLEARLY A PHYSICIAN WHO'S MAYBE.

02:00:08.234 --> 02:00:11.337 region:rollup2
IN A SMALLER PRACTICE IN THE

02:00:10.003 --> 02:00:13.273 region:rollup2
MORE REMOTE AREA AND DOESN'T

02:00:11.337 --> 02:00:14.941 region:rollup2

TO THIS PANEL THAT MAYBE MADAM

02:01:11.831 --> 02:01:15.168 region:rollup2
CHAIR I THINK IT IS ONE OF OUR

02:01:13.833 --> 02:01:17.370 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES OF HOW.

02:01:15.168 --> 02:01:20.073 region:rollup2
OR WE HAVE DISPARITIES HAVE

02:01:17.370 --> 02:01:21.674 region:rollup2
ACCESS ON MANY LEVELS.

I DON'T HAVE THE ANSWER THAT

02:01:27.013 --> 02:01:29.949 region:rollup2
QUESTION BUT I WOULD JUST MAKE

02:01:28.515 --> 02:01:31.050 region:rollup2
AN OBSERVATION THAT THAT'S NOT A

02:01:29.949 --> 02:01:32.819 region:rollup2
PROBLEM THAT'S UNIQUE TO THE END

02:01:31.050 --> 02:01:34.387 region:rollup2
OF LIFE OPTION ACT.

02:01:32.819 --> 02:01:35.622 region:rollup2
THAT'S A IF YOU'VE DESCRIBED A

02:01:34.387 --> 02:01:37.190 region:rollup2
PROBLEM WITH.

02:01:35.622 --> 02:01:38.525 region:rollup2
THE WAY HOW CSUS ARE HEALTH

02:01:37.190 --> 02:01:39.425 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS ARE ORGANIZED.

02:01:38.525 --> 02:01:41.161 region:rollup2
AND.

02:01:39.425 --> 02:01:43.363 region:rollup2

CARE.

02:01:45.165 --> 02:01:48.668 region:rollup2
YEAH.

02:01:47.167 --> 02:01:50.503 region:rollup2
I WOULD HAVE TUCKED CHAIRMAN

02:01:48.668 --> 02:01:52.071 region:rollup2
THAT TIME I HAVE GONE TO A

02:01:50.503 --> 02:01:53.873 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF.

02:01:52.071 --> 02:01:55.675 region:rollup2
OF PLACES TO.

02:01:53.873 --> 02:01:56.576 region:rollup2
SPEAK ABOUT HOW ONE WOULD

THESE ARE LARGELY.

02:02:00.980 --> 02:02:06.786 region:rollup2
ABOUT COUNTY FUNDED FACILITIES.

02:02:04.050 --> 02:02:07.921 region:rollup2
AND WHAT WHAT WE FIND IS THAT IF

02:02:06.786 --> 02:02:10.423 region:rollup2
THERE ISN'T ADEQUATE PALLIATIVE

02:02:07.921 --> 02:02:11.391 region:rollup2
CARE.

OPTION ACT

02:02:12.825 --> 02:02:18.131 region:rollup2
IS NONEXISTENT.

02:02:15.295 --> 02:02:18.598 region:rollup2
THAT IN FACT ONE NEEDS TO HAVE

02:02:18.131 --> 02:02:21.301 region:rollup2
AN ADEQUATE PALLIATIVE

02:02:18.598 --> 02:02:23.203 region:rollup2
STRUCTURE.

02:02:21.301 --> 02:02:25.538 region:rollup2
TO EVEN CONSIDER AS AN

I'M GONNA TALK A LITTLE BIT

02:04:51.451 --> 02:04:53.252 region:rollup2
ABOUTHOW WE STARTED

02:04:52.919 --> 02:04:54.887 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTING.

02:04:53.252 --> 02:04:56.723 region:rollup2
.

02:04:54.887 --> 02:04:58.191 region:rollup2
FOR OUR OWN STAFF

02:04:56.723 --> 02:04:59.592 region:rollup2
SO LOOKING AT WHAT DID WE DO

02:04:58.191 --> 02:05:01.561 region:rollup2
AROUND PROTOCOLS WHICH WE DID

02:04:59.592 --> 02:05:03.129 region:rollup2
DEVELOP. A WHAT DID WE DO AROUND

02:05:01.561 --> 02:05:04.163 region:rollup2
EDUCATION AND SUPPORT OF THE

02:05:03.129 --> 02:05:05.465 region:rollup2
STAFF AND THEN SOME OF THE

02:05:04.163 --> 02:05:07.200 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES THAT WE ARE FINDING

02:05:05.465 --> 02:05:10.203 region:rollup2
OURSELVES FACED WITH ON A DAY TO

02:05:07.200 --> 02:05:11.671 region:rollup2
DAY BASIS AND ALSO INCREASING.

02:05:10.203 --> 02:05:13.639 region:rollup2
SO ONE OF THE THINGS I THINK IS

02:05:11.671 --> 02:05:14.240 region:rollup2
REALLY ON IMPERATIVE TALK ALL OF

02:05:13.639 --> 02:05:14.807 region:rollup2
THE WORK THAT WE'RE ALL DOING

02:05:14.240 --> 02:05:17.276 region:rollup2
IS.

02:05:14.807 --> 02:05:19.045 region:rollup2
AND FOR US IS WE USE THAT IDEA

02:05:17.276 --> 02:05:20.213 region:rollup2
OF PATIENT EXPERIENCE IT'S EVEN

02:05:19.045 --> 02:05:22.181 region:rollup2
IN MY OWN TITLE AS THE

02:05:20.213 --> 02:05:24.250 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT THAT OVERSEES. ALL

02:05:22.181 --> 02:05:25.852 region:rollup2
THE PSYCHOSOCIAL DISCIPLINES UP

02:05:24.250 --> 02:05:27.754 region:rollup2
QUALITY AND EDUCATION AT OUR

02:05:25.852 --> 02:05:29.155 region:rollup2
SITE AFFECTS.

02:05:27.754 --> 02:05:29.422 region:rollup2
AND SO ONE OF THE THINGS WE DID

02:05:29.155 --> 02:05:30.890 region:rollup2
ONCE THE.

02:05:29.422 --> 02:05:33.159 region:rollup2
.

02:05:30.890 --> 02:05:34.560 region:rollup2
ACT WAS PASSED BEFORE THE

02:05:33.159 --> 02:05:36.729 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTATION WE ACTUALLY.

02:05:34.560 --> 02:05:37.830 region:rollup2
UPDATED PROTOCOLS WE DO HAVE IT

02:05:36.729 --> 02:05:38.998 region:rollup2
SITES IN OREGON SO WE UPDATED

02:05:37.830 --> 02:05:40.933 region:rollup2
PROTOCOLS.

02:05:38.998 --> 02:05:42.268 region:rollup2
SURROUNDING THAT ACT

02:05:40.933 --> 02:05:43.770 region:rollup2
AND AND CALLED PHYSICIAN AID IN

02:05:42.268 --> 02:05:45.304 region:rollup2
DYING.

02:05:43.770 --> 02:05:46.739 region:rollup2
AND REALLY THERE ARE A FEW

02:05:45.304 --> 02:05:48.141 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT WE THINK ARE KIND OF

02:05:46.739 --> 02:05:50.510 region:rollup2
UNIQUE TO THE WAY THAT WE DID

02:05:48.141 --> 02:05:52.044 region:rollup2
THIS PROTOCOL SO ONE OF THEM IS.

02:05:50.510 --> 02:05:53.146 region:rollup2
AT EVERY PATIENT REQUEST I'M

02:05:52.044 --> 02:05:54.347 region:rollup2
SIMILAR TO WHAT DOCTOR FUHRMAN

02:05:53.146 --> 02:05:55.348 region:rollup2
WAS TALKING ABOUT HAVING A

02:05:54.347 --> 02:05:56.983 region:rollup2
PATIENT ADVOCATE I'M THAT

02:05:55.348 --> 02:05:58.618 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL FOR THE CALIFORNIA

02:05:56.983 --> 02:05:59.118 region:rollup2
SITES ARE NATIONAL DIRECTORS OF

02:05:58.618 --> 02:06:00.920 region:rollup2
SUPPORTIVE CARE PATIENT

02:05:59.118 --> 02:06:03.022 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE. AND OUR REGIONAL

02:06:00.920 --> 02:06:04.490 region:rollup2
TEAMS ARE WELL VERSED IN THE LAW

02:06:03.022 --> 02:06:06.993 region:rollup2
AND PROVIDING THAT EDUCATION ON

02:06:04.490 --> 02:06:08.995 region:rollup2
A REGULAR BASIS.

02:06:06.993 --> 02:06:10.430 region:rollup2
I'M OUR PHYSICIANS DO HAVE THE

02:06:08.995 --> 02:06:12.965 region:rollup2
OPTION TO PARTICIPATE AS THE

02:06:10.430 --> 02:06:14.700 region:rollup2

INTO OUR PROTOCOL THAT THEY MAY

02:06:18.504 --> 02:06:21.774 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATE.

02:06:20.306 --> 02:06:23.810 region:rollup2
I STAFF MAY BE PRESENT AT THE

02:06:21.774 --> 02:06:26.212 region:rollup2
TIME OF INGESTION WHICH I THINK

02:06:23.810 --> 02:06:27.447 region:rollup2
FOR SOME SITES IS RATHER UNIQUE

02:06:26.212 --> 02:06:29.615 region:rollup2
AS LONG AS WE HAVE TO STAFF

02:06:27.447 --> 02:06:31.751 region:rollup2
MEMBERS PRESENT AND. PART OF THE

02:06:29.615 --> 02:06:33.019 region:rollup2
THEORY BEHIND THAT WAS.

02:06:31.751 --> 02:06:35.221 region:rollup2
COURSE THE LEGAL ASPECTS

02:06:33.019 --> 02:06:37.657 region:rollup2
SURROUNDING IT BUT ALSO THE IDEA

02:06:35.221 --> 02:06:40.026 region:rollup2
AROUND THAN BEING ABLE TO DIVIDE

02:06:37.657 --> 02:06:42.328 region:rollup2
AND CONQUER SO PATIENTS FAMILY

02:06:40.026 --> 02:06:44.330 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY EACH OTHER OR OTHER.

02:06:42.328 --> 02:06:47.767 region:rollup2
HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS THAT WE

02:06:44.330 --> 02:06:48.701 region:rollup2
ARE COLLABORATING WITH.

02:06:47.767 --> 02:06:50.102 region:rollup2
THEN WE LOOKED AT REALLY THE

02:06:48.701 --> 02:06:52.405 region:rollup2
ROLLOUT IN EDUCATION AND WE

02:06:50.102 --> 02:06:52.905 region:rollup2
STARTED THAT AGAIN IN ADVANCE OF

02:06:52.405 --> 02:06:55.141 region:rollup2
THE.

02:06:52.905 --> 02:06:57.210 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ACT AND

02:06:55.141 --> 02:06:59.011 region:rollup2
THE INITIAL I ROLLED OUT TO THAT

02:06:57.210 --> 02:07:00.680 region:rollup2
WE DID WAS A LIVE WEAPON ARE

02:06:59.011 --> 02:07:02.615 region:rollup2
WHICH WE RECORDED I'VE HAD A.

02:07:00.680 --> 02:07:04.917 region:rollup2
EXTENSIVE Q. AND A SESSION.

02:07:02.615 --> 02:07:06.486 region:rollup2
WHICH IN IN A FACTOR THEN CAME

02:07:04.917 --> 02:07:08.554 region:rollup2
BACK TO SOME UPDATES ON OUR

02:07:06.486 --> 02:07:10.490 region:rollup2
PROTOCOL TO REALLY EXPLAIN TO

02:07:08.554 --> 02:07:12.325 region:rollup2
THE STAFF SOME OF THE. ASPECTS

02:07:10.490 --> 02:07:13.626 region:rollup2
THAT THEY HIDE IN ORDER TO MOVE

02:07:12.325 --> 02:07:15.061 region:rollup2
FORWARD.

02:07:13.626 --> 02:07:16.596 region:rollup2
WE REALLY WANTED TO ENCOURAGE

02:07:15.061 --> 02:07:17.330 region:rollup2
AND EMPOWER OUR STAFF MEMBERS TO

02:07:16.596 --> 02:07:19.265 region:rollup2
REFLECT ON THEIR OWN BELIEF

SYSTEMS.

02:07:19.265 --> 02:07:21.701 region:rollup2

AS THEY RELATE TO THE LAW

02:07:21.701 --> 02:07:25.438 region:rollup2
INVITING THEM TO SHARE THEIR

02:07:23.269 --> 02:07:26.506 region:rollup2
WILLINGNESS TO PARTICIPATE OR

02:07:25.438 --> 02:07:28.174 region:rollup2
THEIR CONVICTION NOT TO WITH

02:07:26.506 --> 02:07:30.209 region:rollup2
THEIR THEIR IMMEDIATE LEADERSHIP

02:07:28.174 --> 02:07:31.911 region:rollup2
TEAMS. AS A RESULT OF THAT WE'VE

IN TERMS OF REALLY SUPPORTING

BOTH THE PATIENT CHOICE AND THE

02:07:47.593 --> 02:07:52.331 region:rollup2
STUFF CHOICE AND DECISION.

02:07:49.762 --> 02:07:54.400 region:rollup2
AS WE HAVE LEARNED MORE AND WE

THEY ARE THAT WITNESS AND BE OF

02:08:16.455 --> 02:08:20.092 region:rollup2
THE SILENT OBSERVER OF THIS. AND

02:08:18.491 --> 02:08:22.395 region:rollup2
WE DID SOME JEOPARDY GAMES WHICH

02:08:20.092 --> 02:08:24.163 region:rollup2

02:08:25.398 --> 02:08:29.001 region:rollup2
RANDOM AND AND ENGAGE IN THIS

02:08:27.333 --> 02:08:31.003 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION DURING IDG.

02:08:29.001 --> 02:08:33.706 region:rollup2
AND A LOT OF EXPERIENTIAL ROLE

02:08:31.003 --> 02:08:34.874 region:rollup2
PLAYS AGAIN TO REALLY HELP THEM.

02:08:33.706 --> 02:08:36.709 region:rollup2
I.

02:08:34.874 --> 02:08:37.877 region:rollup2
BUT OR EMPLOYED THESE.

02:08:36.709 --> 02:08:39.445 region:rollup2
TO REALLY HELP THEM ENGAGE IN

02:08:37.877 --> 02:08:40.546 region:rollup2
FACILITATING A DISCUSSION THAT

02:08:39.445 --> 02:08:42.648 region:rollup2
HONORS WHO THEY ARE AS THE

02:08:40.546 --> 02:08:43.583 region:rollup2
CLINICIAN AS WELL.

02:08:42.648 --> 02:08:44.917 region:rollup2
WE FEEL THAT THEY'RE REALLY MUCH

02:08:43.583 --> 02:08:45.952 region:rollup2
BETTER EQUIPPED THAN THEY WERE

02:08:44.917 --> 02:08:46.886 region:rollup2
WHEN WE FIRST STARTED THIS

02:08:45.952 --> 02:08:48.421 region:rollup2
PROCESS WERE NOTICING MORE AND

02:08:46.886 --> 02:08:50.556 region:rollup2
MORE OF OUR STAFF.

02:08:48.421 --> 02:08:53.226 region:rollup2
WANTING TO PARTICIPATE AND BE

02:08:50.556 --> 02:08:55.127 region:rollup2
PRESENT AND SOME WHO HAD.

02:08:53.226 --> 02:08:56.429 region:rollup2
ORIGINALLY SAID THAT THEY DID

02:08:55.127 --> 02:08:57.830 region:rollup2
NOT WANT TO PARTICIPATE AT ALL

02:08:56.429 --> 02:08:59.765 region:rollup2
AND BE AT THE BEDSIDE WITH OUR

02:08:57.830 --> 02:09:01.167 region:rollup2
PATIENTS AND FAMILIES. HAVE NOW

02:08:59.765 --> 02:09:02.702 region:rollup2
BEGUN TO MAKE THE CHOICE TO BE

02:09:01.167 --> 02:09:05.204 region:rollup2
PRESENT FOR CERTAIN PATIENTS AND

02:09:02.702 --> 02:09:06.672 region:rollup2
FAMILIES. AND WE DO HAVE ABOUT

02:09:05.204 --> 02:09:08.808 region:rollup2
FIFTY PERCENT OF OUR STAFF THAT

02:09:06.672 --> 02:09:09.442 region:rollup2
IS AT THE BEDSIDE.

02:09:08.808 --> 02:09:10.876 region:rollup2
WE'VE NOTICED AND THREE OF OUR

02:09:09.442 --> 02:09:11.611 region:rollup2
SITES

02:09:10.876 --> 02:09:14.413 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:09:11.611 --> 02:09:16.549 region:rollup2
WE HAVE WHAT WE CALL A CHAMPION

02:09:14.413 --> 02:09:17.883 region:rollup2
OF THIS PROGRAM LOCALLY. AND SO

02:09:16.549 --> 02:09:19.585 region:rollup2
AT THREE OF THE SITES CURRENTLY

02:09:17.883 --> 02:09:21.687 region:rollup2
THEY'RE TAKING INITIATIVES TO

02:09:19.585 --> 02:09:22.255 region:rollup2
PROVIDE EDUCATION TO THE LARGER

02:09:21.687 --> 02:09:23.589 region:rollup2
HEALTH SYSTEMS THAT WE WORK

02:09:22.255 --> 02:09:25.157 region:rollup2
WITH.

02:09:23.589 --> 02:09:26.959 region:rollup2
ON THE HOSPITALS THAT ARE

02:09:25.157 --> 02:09:28.894 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATING THE AD ASSISTED

02:09:26.959 --> 02:09:30.596 region:rollup2
LIVING FACILITIES THE SKILLED

02:09:28.894 --> 02:09:32.431 region:rollup2
NURSING FACILITIES TO REALLY

02:09:30.596 --> 02:09:36.402 region:rollup2
HELP FRAME THE IDEA OF PATIENT

02:09:32.431 --> 02:09:37.837 region:rollup2
CHOICE.

02:09:36.402 --> 02:09:40.039 region:rollup2
THEN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THESE ARE

02:09:37.837 --> 02:09:41.874 region:rollup2
VERY EARLY NUMBERS BUT I'M ARE

02:09:40.039 --> 02:09:44.043 region:rollup2
SIX CALIFORNIA PROGRAMS HAD

02:09:41.874 --> 02:09:46.012 region:rollup2
AROUND TWO DOZEN REQUESTS.

02:09:44.043 --> 02:09:46.979 region:rollup2
AND WE'VE HAD EIGHT COMPLETED

02:09:46.012 --> 02:09:49.315 region:rollup2
AND TWO ARE SCHEDULED FOR THIS

02:09:46.979 --> 02:09:51.317 region:rollup2
WEEK.

02:09:49.315 --> 02:09:52.351 region:rollup2
AND LIKE OTHERS ARE CHALLENGES

02:09:51.317 --> 02:09:53.052 region:rollup2
ARE VERY SIMILAR THERE ARE ABOUT

02:09:52.351 --> 02:09:54.887 region:rollup2
FIVE.

02:09:53.052 --> 02:09:56.489 region:rollup2
AND.

02:09:54.887 --> 02:09:58.124 region:rollup2
THE ONE BIG ONE I THINK FOR ALL

02:09:56.489 --> 02:10:00.526 region:rollup2
HOSPICE PROVIDERS IS THE THE

02:09:58.124 --> 02:10:02.094 region:rollup2
LATE REFERRAL THAT WE RECEIVE.

02:10:00.526 --> 02:10:03.896 region:rollup2
AND SO THAT'S THAT'S BEEN ONE

02:10:02.094 --> 02:10:05.731 region:rollup2
BECAUSE NOT HAVING THAT TIME

02:10:03.896 --> 02:10:07.533 region:rollup2
FRAME RELIEVED MAKES THIS VERY

02:10:05.731 --> 02:10:09.135 region:rollup2
BURDENSOME AND UNLIKELY FOR SOME

02:10:07.533 --> 02:10:11.604 region:rollup2
OF OUR PATIENTS PARTICIPATE.

02:10:09.135 --> 02:10:13.105 region:rollup2
AND SOME HAVE BEEN DROPPED FROM

02:10:11.604 --> 02:10:15.474 region:rollup2
THEIR PREVIOUS PROVIDERS.

02:10:13.105 --> 02:10:16.742 region:rollup2
EVEN AFTER THEY WERE ELIGIBLE

02:10:15.474 --> 02:10:20.413 region:rollup2
FOR THE BENEFIT AND SO THEY COME

02:10:16.742 --> 02:10:21.314 region:rollup2
TO US AGAIN RATHER LATE.

02:10:20.413 --> 02:10:23.049 region:rollup2
WE DO CONTINUE NOTICE.

02:10:21.314 --> 02:10:24.183 region:rollup2
.

02:10:23.049 --> 02:10:26.419 region:rollup2
SLOWLY DECREASING FRED I'M

02:10:24.183 --> 02:10:28.054 region:rollup2
CONCERNED FROM THE STOCK.

02:10:26.419 --> 02:10:29.322 region:rollup2
AS WHERE WE REALLY STARTED RIGHT

02:10:28.054 --> 02:10:30.823 region:rollup2
TO STOP THINKING OH MY GOSH I'M

02:10:29.322 --> 02:10:32.358 region:rollup2
GOING TO MISS A STEP.

02:10:30.823 --> 02:10:33.993 region:rollup2
AND WHAT DOES THAT MEAN TO WORKS

02:10:32.358 --> 02:10:35.561 region:rollup2
MY OWN LICENSE BUT WE'RE

02:10:33.993 --> 02:10:37.430 region:rollup2
NOTICING NOT DECREASING WITH THE

02:10:35.561 --> 02:10:38.731 region:rollup2
MORE EDUCATION WE PROVIDE AND

02:10:37.430 --> 02:10:40.066 region:rollup2
THE MORE TEACHING UP INSIDE THAT

02:10:38.731 --> 02:10:42.568 region:rollup2
WE PROVIDE AND SUPPORT AT THAT

02:10:40.066 --> 02:10:44.070 region:rollup2
SITE WE PROVIDE.

02:10:42.568 --> 02:10:45.471 region:rollup2
HI I'M ONE OF THE RECENT

02:10:44.070 --> 02:10:46.772 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCES THAT WERE HAVING

02:10:45.471 --> 02:10:48.808 region:rollup2
MORE AND MORE INCREASED.

02:10:46.772 --> 02:10:50.242 region:rollup2
AND HOW IT IS BEING REPORTED BY

02:10:48.808 --> 02:10:51.644 region:rollup2
THE STAFF IS I'M THE VETERANS

02:10:50.242 --> 02:10:53.546 region:rollup2
POPULATION.

02:10:51.644 --> 02:10:54.680 region:rollup2
AND SO IN PROVIDING THAT

02:10:53.546 --> 02:10:55.181 region:rollup2
INFORMED CONSENT TO THAT

02:10:54.680 --> 02:10:57.883 region:rollup2
POPULATION AROUND THEIR

02:10:55.181 --> 02:11:00.619 region:rollup2
BENEFITS.

02:10:57.883 --> 02:11:02.188 region:rollup2
ON IF THEY HAVE THE SENSE OF

02:11:00.619 --> 02:11:04.223 region:rollup2
QUOTE UNQUOTE AT OBJECTION

02:11:02.188 --> 02:11:05.858 region:rollup2
AROUND THE WHAT IFS.

02:11:04.223 --> 02:11:07.259 region:rollup2
AND SO SOME OF THEM ARE OPTING

02:11:05.858 --> 02:11:07.760 region:rollup2
NOT TO IN THAT BUS BY ITS

02:11:07.259 --> 02:11:09.929 region:rollup2
INCREASING SOME OF THEIR

02:11:07.760 --> 02:11:11.397 region:rollup2
SUFFERING.

02:11:09.929 --> 02:11:13.232 region:rollup2
AND THEN AT THE VERY FOREFRONT.

02:11:11.397 --> 02:11:14.867 region:rollup2
WHICH MANY HAVE MENTIONED

02:11:13.232 --> 02:11:16.335 region:rollup2
ALREADY IS THE IDEA OF THE POWER

02:11:14.867 --> 02:11:18.604 region:rollup2
THE ABILITY FOR FACILITIES

02:11:16.335 --> 02:11:20.239 region:rollup2
TOPPED OUT. AND SO HOW DO WE GET

02:11:18.604 --> 02:11:21.407 region:rollup2
CREATIVE IN SUPPORTING OUR

02:11:20.239 --> 02:11:22.975 region:rollup2
PATIENTS WHO ARE IN THE

02:11:21.407 --> 02:11:24.243 region:rollup2
FACILITIES LIKE HOSPITALS OR THE

02:11:22.975 --> 02:11:25.878 region:rollup2
ASSISTED LIVING FACILITIES ARE

02:11:24.243 --> 02:11:27.213 region:rollup2
SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES WHERE

02:11:25.878 --> 02:11:29.482 region:rollup2
THEY CURRENTLY RESIDE IN CALL

02:11:27.213 --> 02:11:32.218 region:rollup2
HOME. AND HOW DO WE HELP THEM IF

02:11:29.482 --> 02:11:34.387 region:rollup2
TRULY THEY ARE ELIGIBLE FOR THE

02:11:32.218 --> 02:11:35.020 region:rollup2
ACT IN THIS IS REALLY THEIR LAST

02:11:34.387 --> 02:11:36.522 region:rollup2
OPTION AND THE OPTION THAT THEY

02:11:35.020 --> 02:11:37.857 region:rollup2
WANT TO CHOOSE.

02:11:36.522 --> 02:11:39.058 region:rollup2
DESPITE THE CHALLENGES WE'RE

02:11:37.857 --> 02:11:40.459 region:rollup2
GONNA KEEP GOING AND WILL WILL

02:11:39.058 --> 02:11:41.794 region:rollup2
MOVE FORWARD AND.

02:11:40.459 --> 02:11:43.095 region:rollup2
AT THAT REALLY KEEP OUR

02:11:41.794 --> 02:11:43.963 region:rollup2
PATIENTS THEIR FAMILIES AT THE

02:11:43.095 --> 02:11:45.464 region:rollup2
FOREFRONT OF THE CARE THAT WE

02:11:43.963 --> 02:11:47.233 region:rollup2
PROVIDE I REALLY THINK THE

02:11:45.464 --> 02:11:48.601 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLY FOR. PERMITTING US TO

02:11:47.233 --> 02:11:50.870 region:rollup2
CONTINUE THIS DISCUSSION AND

02:11:48.601 --> 02:11:54.073 region:rollup2
LEARN MORE FROM ONE ANOTHER.

02:11:50.870 --> 02:11:56.008 region:rollup2
VERY MUCH.

02:11:54.073 --> 02:11:58.010 region:rollup2
MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE

02:11:56.008 --> 02:12:00.646 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE THANK YOU AYE AYE ECHO

02:11:58.010 --> 02:12:02.214 region:rollup2
YOUR APPRECIATION THAT THIS

02:12:00.646 --> 02:12:03.749 region:rollup2
PROCESS OF COMING BACK TO THE

02:12:02.214 --> 02:12:05.217 region:rollup2
TABLE EACH YEAR IS BUILT INTO

02:12:03.749 --> 02:12:06.352 region:rollup2
WHAT'S HAPPENING AT THE ROOT OF

02:12:05.217 --> 02:12:07.486 region:rollup2
IT HERE WHERE THE LAWS BEEN

02:12:06.352 --> 02:12:09.488 region:rollup2
CREATED.

02:12:07.486 --> 02:12:11.023 region:rollup2
I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT THE MORE

02:12:09.488 --> 02:12:12.291 region:rollup2
WE CAN HAVE CONVERSATIONS AND

02:12:11.023 --> 02:12:13.192 region:rollup2
HAVE DIFFERENT PEOPLE COME TO

02:12:12.291 --> 02:12:15.461 region:rollup2
THE TABLE.

02:12:13.192 --> 02:12:17.163 region:rollup2
THE MORE WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE

02:12:15.461 --> 02:12:19.265 region:rollup2
TO FIT IN CAN CONTINUE TO

02:12:17.163 --> 02:12:20.199 region:rollup2
IMPROVE THIS OPTION FOR OUR

02:12:19.265 --> 02:12:22.034 region:rollup2
PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES.

02:12:20.199 --> 02:12:24.837 region:rollup2
SO.

02:12:22.034 --> 02:12:26.071 region:rollup2
MY NAME IS MK NELSON AND I AM

02:12:24.837 --> 02:12:27.940 region:rollup2
DIRECTOR OF SPIRITUAL CARE

02:12:26.071 --> 02:12:29.675 region:rollup2
ADMISSION HOSPICE AND HOME CARE

02:12:27.940 --> 02:12:31.210 region:rollup2
WHERE IN SAN MATEO COUNTY. WE

02:12:29.675 --> 02:12:32.912 region:rollup2
ARE AT A LOCAL HOSPICE THAT

02:12:31.210 --> 02:12:34.780 region:rollup2
STARTED ABOUT THIRTY NINE YEARS

02:12:32.912 --> 02:12:37.149 region:rollup2
AGO JUST FROM TWO OF THE OUR

02:12:34.780 --> 02:12:37.683 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY MEMBERS WHO. WANTED TO

02:12:37.149 --> 02:12:38.717 region:rollup2
HAVE HOSPICE IN THEIR OWN

02:12:37.683 --> 02:12:40.953 region:rollup2
COUNTY.

02:12:38.717 --> 02:12:41.387 region:rollup2
WE'VE GROWN A LOT ESPECIALLY IN

02:12:40.953 --> 02:12:42.721 region:rollup2
THE LAST TEN YEARS.

02:12:41.387 --> 02:12:44.490 region:rollup2
.

02:12:42.721 --> 02:12:46.225 region:rollup2
I WOULD SAY THAT WE'VE BECOME

02:12:44.490 --> 02:12:48.027 region:rollup2
MUCH LARGER THAN WE HAD BEEN

02:12:46.225 --> 02:12:48.994 region:rollup2
ORIGINALLY WE HAVE AROUND TWO

02:12:48.027 --> 02:12:50.095 region:rollup2
HUNDRED AND THIRTY TO TWO

02:12:48.994 --> 02:12:52.164 region:rollup2
HUNDRED FORTY PATIENTS THAT WE

02:12:50.095 --> 02:12:53.766 region:rollup2
SERVE.

02:12:52.164 --> 02:12:55.768 region:rollup2
SINCE THE LAW HAS PASSED.

02:12:53.766 --> 02:12:57.470 region:rollup2
.

02:12:55.768 --> 02:12:59.371 region:rollup2
WE HAVE ACTUALLY SERVED OF ABOUT

02:12:57.470 --> 02:13:00.539 region:rollup2
THIRTY SIX PATIENTS

02:12:59.371 --> 02:13:02.875 region:rollup2
WHICH IS A MUCH HIGHER NUMBER

02:13:00.539 --> 02:13:03.409 region:rollup2
THAN WE ANTICIPATED.

02:13:02.875 --> 02:13:04.510 region:rollup2
EVEN WITH EXPECTING LOWER

02:13:03.409 --> 02:13:07.313 region:rollup2
NUMBERS.

02:13:04.510 --> 02:13:08.814 region:rollup2
WE BEFORE JUNE NINTH TWENTY

02:13:07.313 --> 02:13:09.982 region:rollup2
SIXTEEN CAME WE REALLY WANTED TO

02:13:08.814 --> 02:13:11.484 region:rollup2
BE PREPARED.

02:13:09.982 --> 02:13:13.352 region:rollup2
WE KNEW THAT WE HAD A COUPLE OF

02:13:11.484 --> 02:13:14.220 region:rollup2
DOCTORS WHO WOULD PROBABLY BE

02:13:13.352 --> 02:13:15.454 region:rollup2
WILLING TO BE ATTENDING

02:13:14.220 --> 02:13:18.591 region:rollup2
PHYSICIANS.

02:13:15.454 --> 02:13:20.926 region:rollup2
AND WE ALSO JUST RECOGNIZE THAT

02:13:18.591 --> 02:13:22.695 region:rollup2
THIS WAS A NEW HORIZON FOR END

02:13:20.926 --> 02:13:24.029 region:rollup2
OF LIFE CARE I MYSELF I'VE DONE

02:13:22.695 --> 02:13:24.930 region:rollup2
HOSPICE WORK FOR ABOUT TWELVE

02:13:24.029 --> 02:13:27.099 region:rollup2
YEARS.

02:13:24.930 --> 02:13:28.701 region:rollup2
AND IT HAS BEEN TRUE THAT EVEN

02:13:27.099 --> 02:13:30.836 region:rollup2
FOLKS WHO ARE VETERANS IN THE

02:13:28.701 --> 02:13:31.937 region:rollup2
HOSPICE WORLD THIS HAS BEEN.

02:13:30.836 --> 02:13:33.939 region:rollup2
KIND OF A HUMBLING A NEW

02:13:31.937 --> 02:13:35.708 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE IT REALLY DOES TAKE

02:13:33.939 --> 02:13:37.209 region:rollup2
IT TO THE TO THE NEXT LEVEL.

02:13:35.708 --> 02:13:38.544 region:rollup2
BUT WE WHATEVER LEVEL THAT MAY

02:13:37.209 --> 02:13:41.614 region:rollup2
BE.

02:13:38.544 --> 02:13:42.715 region:rollup2
SO WE WANTED TO BE PREPARED.

02:13:41.614 --> 02:13:44.383 region:rollup2
TO THAT END WE.

02:13:42.715 --> 02:13:45.818 region:rollup2
HAD A SERIES OF BROWN BAG

02:13:44.383 --> 02:13:47.520 region:rollup2
LUNCHES WITH OUR STAFF.

02:13:45.818 --> 02:13:49.221 region:rollup2
INCLUDING ART MINISTRY TO STAFF

02:13:47.520 --> 02:13:52.024 region:rollup2
IN OUR CLINICAL STAFF MAKING

02:13:49.221 --> 02:13:53.759 region:rollup2
SURE THAT FOLKS HAD A CHANCE TO.

02:13:52.024 --> 02:13:54.627 region:rollup2
EXPRESS THEIR CONCERNS ASK THEIR

02:13:53.759 --> 02:13:56.328 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS HAVE OPEN INTO

02:13:54.627 --> 02:13:57.763 region:rollup2
DIALOGUE

02:13:56.328 --> 02:14:00.099 region:rollup2
AND THESE CONVERSATIONS WERE

02:13:57.763 --> 02:14:01.600 region:rollup2
FACILITATED BY SOCIAL WORKERS

02:14:00.099 --> 02:14:02.968 region:rollup2
AND SPIRITUAL COUNSELLORS I'M

02:14:01.600 --> 02:14:04.837 region:rollup2
AND THEN FROM THAT A SMALLER

02:14:02.968 --> 02:14:06.071 region:rollup2
INTERDISCIPLINARY GROUP CRAFTED

02:14:04.837 --> 02:14:07.573 region:rollup2
OUR POLICY.

02:14:06.071 --> 02:14:09.608 region:rollup2
WERE CALLING IT A GROUND UP

02:14:07.573 --> 02:14:12.278 region:rollup2
POLICY REALLY BECAUSE WE WANTED

02:14:09.608 --> 02:14:13.779 region:rollup2
IT TO. COME FROM ALL OF STAFF WE

02:14:12.278 --> 02:14:16.916 region:rollup2
WANTED FOLKS TO FEEL LIKE THEY

02:14:13.779 --> 02:14:17.449 region:rollup2
HAD A VOICE IN WHAT THE PROTOCOL

02:14:16.916 --> 02:14:19.018 region:rollup2
ON POLICY WOULD BE IN THE

02:14:17.449 --> 02:14:19.485 region:rollup2
AGENCY.

02:14:19.018 --> 02:14:21.487 region:rollup2
SO.

02:14:19.485 --> 02:14:23.188 region:rollup2
ONCE THE POLICY WAS CREATED WE

02:14:21.487 --> 02:14:25.457 region:rollup2
ARE ALSO EXTREMELY INTENTIONAL

02:14:23.188 --> 02:14:26.492 region:rollup2
ABOUT HOW WE RULED IT OUT.

02:14:25.457 --> 02:14:28.994 region:rollup2
WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:14:26.492 --> 02:14:29.895 region:rollup2
EVERYONE KNEW WHAT OUR CHOICES

02:14:28.994 --> 02:14:31.764 region:rollup2
HAD BEEN KNEWWHAT THEIR

02:14:29.895 --> 02:14:33.332 region:rollup2
INFORMATION WAS AND TO CREATE

02:14:31.764 --> 02:14:35.067 region:rollup2
JUST ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY AGAIN

02:14:33.332 --> 02:14:37.269 region:rollup2
TO COME BACK TO THE TABLE. AND

02:14:35.067 --> 02:14:39.305 region:rollup2
HAVE DIALOGUE HAVE QUESTIONS

02:14:37.269 --> 02:14:41.440 region:rollup2
A IT SEEMS LIKE THERE IS NO IN%

02:14:39.305 --> 02:14:42.875 region:rollup2
TWO QUESTIONS EXPLORATION IN

02:14:41.440 --> 02:14:45.044 region:rollup2
REFLECTION ON THIS TOPIC.

02:14:42.875 --> 02:14:46.312 region:rollup2
AND SO I PERSONALLY WENT AROUND

02:14:45.044 --> 02:14:47.947 region:rollup2
TO EACH DISCIPLINE AT THEIR OWN

02:14:46.312 --> 02:14:50.049 region:rollup2
STAFF MEETINGS AND CREATED THAT

02:14:47.947 --> 02:14:50.583 region:rollup2
SPACE FOR THEM TAKING UP AN HOUR

02:14:50.049 --> 02:14:51.717 region:rollup2
OR AS MUCH TIME REALLY IS

02:14:50.583 --> 02:14:54.019 region:rollup2
NEEDED.

02:14:51.717 --> 02:14:54.853 region:rollup2
BUT USUALLY THE CONVERSATIONS

02:14:54.019 --> 02:14:56.388 region:rollup2
WERE PRETTY EXTENSIVE.

02:14:54.853 --> 02:14:58.223 region:rollup2
.

02:14:56.388 --> 02:14:59.892 region:rollup2
AS WE.

02:14:58.223 --> 02:15:00.826 region:rollup2
CAN TEXT OR TO TO HAVE SOME ON

02:14:59.892 --> 02:15:02.595 region:rollup2
THE GROUND EXPERIENCES.

02:15:00.826 --> 02:15:04.997 region:rollup2
.

02:15:02.595 --> 02:15:07.733 region:rollup2
WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:15:04.997 --> 02:15:10.035 region:rollup2
STAFF FELT SUPPORTED THAT THEY

02:15:07.733 --> 02:15:12.037 region:rollup2
FELT THAT THEY. WERE ABLE TO

02:15:10.035 --> 02:15:13.606 region:rollup2
COME INTO MY OFFICE INTO

02:15:12.037 --> 02:15:15.341 region:rollup2
ANYONE'S OFFICE AND HAVE

02:15:13.606 --> 02:15:16.775 region:rollup2
DIALOGUE AROUND IT. WE ALSO

02:15:15.341 --> 02:15:18.978 region:rollup2
WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY

02:15:16.775 --> 02:15:20.613 region:rollup2
KNEW A COUPLE OF THINGS ONE.

02:15:18.978 --> 02:15:21.747 region:rollup2
THEY COULD OPT OUT AND THAT

02:15:20.613 --> 02:15:23.082 region:rollup2
THEIR CHOICE IN THEIR OPINION

02:15:21.747 --> 02:15:25.117 region:rollup2
WOULD BE RESPECTED.

02:15:23.082 --> 02:15:26.852 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S ANYWHERE FROM A

02:15:25.117 --> 02:15:28.520 region:rollup2
DOCTOR TO ANYONE ELSE IN THE

02:15:26.852 --> 02:15:29.088 region:rollup2
AGENCY WHO MIGHT BE ENCOUNTERING

02:15:28.520 --> 02:15:31.223 region:rollup2
FOLKS.

02:15:29.088 --> 02:15:34.660 region:rollup2
AVAILING THEMSELVES.

02:15:31.223 --> 02:15:36.695 region:rollup2
WE ALSO WANTED FOLKS TO HAVE

02:15:34.660 --> 02:15:38.764 region:rollup2
THOUGHT ABOUT THIS ENOUGH.

02:15:36.695 --> 02:15:40.632 region:rollup2
AND HAD ENOUGH CONVERSATION THAT

02:15:38.764 --> 02:15:42.635 region:rollup2
SHOULD THEY ENCOUNTER A QUESTION

02:15:40.632 --> 02:15:44.069 region:rollup2
ABOUT IT FROM. A PATIENT A

02:15:42.635 --> 02:15:45.871 region:rollup2
FAMILY MEMBER EVEN JUST SOMEONE

02:15:44.069 --> 02:15:46.672 region:rollup2
IN THE COMMUNITY IF THEY DIDN'T

02:15:45.871 --> 02:15:48.540 region:rollup2
WISH TO DISCUSS AT THAT THEY

02:15:46.672 --> 02:15:49.975 region:rollup2
COULD. GRACIOUSLY DECLINE THE

02:15:48.540 --> 02:15:51.343 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION AND STEER THEM IN

02:15:49.975 --> 02:15:52.678 region:rollup2
THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND WE

02:15:51.343 --> 02:15:53.946 region:rollup2
DIDN'T WANT TO PERPETUATE ANY

02:15:52.678 --> 02:15:55.414 region:rollup2
KIND OF SHAMAR JUDGMENT FROM

02:15:53.946 --> 02:15:57.449 region:rollup2
THAT KIND OF QUESTION COMING UP

02:15:55.414 --> 02:15:59.118 region:rollup2
SO. THAT WE WANT FOLKS TO NOT BE

02:15:57.449 --> 02:16:00.986 region:rollup2
CAUGHT OFF GUARD WE DIDN'T WANT

02:15:59.118 --> 02:16:01.954 region:rollup2
IT TO BE A TABOO SUBJECT THAT

02:16:00.986 --> 02:16:03.522 region:rollup2
OUR STAFF MEMBERS WERE

02:16:01.954 --> 02:16:05.524 region:rollup2
WHISPERING ABOUT IN THE CORNERS

02:16:03.522 --> 02:16:07.926 region:rollup2
RIGHT. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT.

02:16:05.524 --> 02:16:11.497 region:rollup2
IS A BIG DEAL FOR OUR STATE AND

02:16:07.926 --> 02:16:14.800 region:rollup2
AND AND FOR OUR AGENCIES SO.

02:16:11.497 --> 02:16:16.335 region:rollup2
ABOUT SIX SEVEN MONTHS IN WE

02:16:14.800 --> 02:16:17.970 region:rollup2
DECIDED TO REVISE THE POLICY WE

02:16:16.335 --> 02:16:19.772 region:rollup2
JUST WANTED TO KIND OF REVISIT

02:16:17.970 --> 02:16:21.507 region:rollup2
ON THE GROUND EXPERIENCES. AND

02:16:19.772 --> 02:16:22.875 region:rollup2
TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT WHAT WAS

02:16:21.507 --> 02:16:24.643 region:rollup2
WORKING INTERNALLY WHAT WASN'T

02:16:22.875 --> 02:16:26.979 region:rollup2
I'M ORIGINALLY WE HAD REQUIRED

02:16:24.643 --> 02:16:29.048 region:rollup2
INTERDISCIPLINARY TEAMS TO HAVE.

02:16:26.979 --> 02:16:30.883 region:rollup2
BOTH A PRE BRIEF AND A DEBRIEF

02:16:29.048 --> 02:16:34.319 region:rollup2
IF ANYONE EXPRESSED INTEREST.

02:16:30.883 --> 02:16:36.088 region:rollup2
IN USING THE MEDICATION THEN

02:16:34.319 --> 02:16:37.222 region:rollup2
THE WHOLE TEAM WOULD MEET A JUST

02:16:36.088 --> 02:16:39.692 region:rollup2
TO MAKE SURE EVERYONE IS ON THE

02:16:37.222 --> 02:16:39.958 region:rollup2
SAME PAGE EXPLORE OPPORTUNITIES.

02:16:39.692 --> 02:16:41.560 region:rollup2
AND THEN.

02:16:39.958 --> 02:16:43.095 region:rollup2
.

02:16:41.560 --> 02:16:44.730 region:rollup2
AND THEN AFTER THE DEATH AS WELL

02:16:43.095 --> 02:16:45.764 region:rollup2
JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAD A

02:16:44.730 --> 02:16:47.566 region:rollup2
CHANCE TO SHARE THE STORY.

02:16:45.764 --> 02:16:49.601 region:rollup2
.

02:16:47.566 --> 02:16:50.903 region:rollup2
WE FOUND THAT AFTER AWHILE IT

02:16:49.601 --> 02:16:53.005 region:rollup2
WAS A LITTLE BIT LIKE HERDING

02:16:50.903 --> 02:16:54.673 region:rollup2
CATS IT WAS REALLY. DIFFICULT.

02:16:53.005 --> 02:16:56.341 region:rollup2
TO MANAGE THAT WITHIN OUR

02:16:54.673 --> 02:16:57.409 region:rollup2
AGENCY IN SO.

02:16:56.341 --> 02:16:58.811 region:rollup2
AND THAT WAS ONE OF THE

02:16:57.409 --> 02:16:59.978 region:rollup2
REVISIONS THAT WE MADE IN THE

02:16:58.811 --> 02:17:01.680 region:rollup2
POLICY THAT WE STILL STRONGLY

02:16:59.978 --> 02:17:03.549 region:rollup2
ENCOURAGED.

02:17:01.680 --> 02:17:05.350 region:rollup2
FOLKS TO DO THAT BUT THAT IT WAS

02:17:03.549 --> 02:17:06.819 region:rollup2
NO LONGER MANDATORY I'M AND BY

02:17:05.350 --> 02:17:08.153 region:rollup2
THAT TIME WE OBSERVE SOMETHING

02:17:06.819 --> 02:17:09.721 region:rollup2
SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU MENTIONED

02:17:08.153 --> 02:17:11.557 region:rollup2
THAT FOLKS WERE BECOMING MUCH

02:17:09.721 --> 02:17:13.258 region:rollup2
MORE COMFORTABLE. IN TALKING

02:17:11.557 --> 02:17:14.226 region:rollup2
ABOUT IT IN ENCOUNTERING IT

02:17:13.258 --> 02:17:16.995 region:rollup2
SEVERAL PEOPLE THAT HAD ON THE

02:17:14.226 --> 02:17:17.996 region:rollup2
GROUND EXPERIENCES SO WE'VE JUST

02:17:16.995 --> 02:17:19.765 region:rollup2
BEGAN TO.

02:17:17.996 --> 02:17:21.100 region:rollup2
CREATE OPEN FORUMS AGAIN WHERE

02:17:19.765 --> 02:17:23.235 region:rollup2
FOLKS CAN COME BACK TO THE TABLE

02:17:21.100 --> 02:17:25.037 region:rollup2
SHARE THEIR STORIES AND.

02:17:23.235 --> 02:17:26.438 region:rollup2
CLINICIANS REALLY SEEM TO

02:17:25.037 --> 02:17:27.739 region:rollup2
BENEFIT FROM HEARING WHAT OTHER

02:17:26.438 --> 02:17:29.508 region:rollup2
FOLKS HAD ACTUALLY GONE THROUGH

02:17:27.739 --> 02:17:31.777 region:rollup2
WHICH IS ON THE GROUND ACTUAL.

02:17:29.508 --> 02:17:34.113 region:rollup2
STORIES.

02:17:31.777 --> 02:17:35.280 region:rollup2
ALSO SIX OR SEVEN MONTHS AND WE

02:17:34.113 --> 02:17:35.814 region:rollup2
STARTED GETTING A LOT OF PHONE

02:17:35.280 --> 02:17:37.049 region:rollup2
CALLS FROM OUR HEALTHCARE

02:17:35.814 --> 02:17:39.218 region:rollup2
PARTNERS.

02:17:37.049 --> 02:17:40.753 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT FACILITIES WHERE THAT

02:17:39.218 --> 02:17:42.788 region:rollup2
WE WORK WITH OTHER HEALTH CARE

02:17:40.753 --> 02:17:44.957 region:rollup2
AGENCIES WHO HAD SOMEHOW HEARD

02:17:42.788 --> 02:17:46.592 region:rollup2
THAT WE WERE BEING VERY OPEN I'D

02:17:44.957 --> 02:17:48.427 region:rollup2
IN ENGAGING WITH THIS WITH OUR

02:17:46.592 --> 02:17:49.962 region:rollup2
STAFFING COULD WE COME IN. AND

02:17:48.427 --> 02:17:51.797 region:rollup2
HELP THEM FIGURE OUT HOW TO TALK

02:17:49.962 --> 02:17:53.432 region:rollup2
TO THEIR STAFF FIGURE OUT HOW TO

02:17:51.797 --> 02:17:54.800 region:rollup2
CRAFT A POLICY AND SO. I'VE

02:17:53.432 --> 02:17:56.535 region:rollup2
SPENT A FAIR AMOUNT OF TIME

02:17:54.800 --> 02:17:58.604 region:rollup2
DOING THAT WORKING WITH HEALTH

02:17:56.535 --> 02:18:01.740 region:rollup2
CARE PARTNERS IN SAN MATEO

02:17:58.604 --> 02:18:03.242 region:rollup2
COUNTY JUST TO.

02:18:01.740 --> 02:18:04.776 region:rollup2
KIND OF DEMYSTIFY IT IN A WAY ME

02:18:03.242 --> 02:18:06.845 region:rollup2
MY EXPERIENCE OF HAD MANY

02:18:04.776 --> 02:18:08.347 region:rollup2
CONVERSATIONS SO FAR SOME WITH

02:18:06.845 --> 02:18:10.749 region:rollup2
LEADERSHIP AND PRESIDENTS AND

02:18:08.347 --> 02:18:12.551 region:rollup2
DIRECTORS OF AGENCIES AND.

02:18:10.749 --> 02:18:13.785 region:rollup2
DOWN TO HOME HEALTH AIDES IN

02:18:12.551 --> 02:18:14.753 region:rollup2
FOLKS WHO ARE WORKING VERY

02:18:13.785 --> 02:18:15.988 region:rollup2
INTIMATELY ON THE GROUND WITH

02:18:14.753 --> 02:18:18.490 region:rollup2
PATIENTS.

02:18:15.988 --> 02:18:20.159 region:rollup2
AND MY EXPERIENCE EVERY TIME HAS

02:18:18.490 --> 02:18:21.727 region:rollup2
BEEN THAT MOST OF THE PEOPLE GOT

02:18:20.159 --> 02:18:23.562 region:rollup2
UP FROM THE TABLE FEELING BETTER

02:18:21.727 --> 02:18:24.563 region:rollup2
THAN WHEN THEY HAD SAT DOWN. AND

02:18:23.562 --> 02:18:25.931 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT BECAUSE I OFFERED ANY

02:18:24.563 --> 02:18:27.566 region:rollup2
KIND OF.

02:18:25.931 --> 02:18:29.234 region:rollup2
IN LIGHTNING WISDOM IT WAS

02:18:27.566 --> 02:18:30.135 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY HAD A CHANCE TO

02:18:29.234 --> 02:18:31.970 region:rollup2
TALK ABOUT IT ASK THEIR

02:18:30.135 --> 02:18:33.071 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS.

02:18:31.970 --> 02:18:35.107 region:rollup2
EVEN IF THERE WAS.

02:18:33.071 --> 02:18:36.475 region:rollup2
.

02:18:35.107 --> 02:18:37.976 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW MIXED FEELINGS WITHIN

02:18:36.475 --> 02:18:39.511 region:rollup2
THEMSELVES I MEAN THAT'S PRETTY

02:18:37.976 --> 02:18:40.879 region:rollup2
COMMON RIGHT YOU CAN. YOU CAN

02:18:39.511 --> 02:18:42.014 region:rollup2
HAVE IT MULTIPLE FEELINGS ABOUT

02:18:40.879 --> 02:18:43.182 region:rollup2
ONE PARTICULAR THING

02:18:42.014 --> 02:18:43.882 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY WHEN IT'S IS A

02:18:43.182 --> 02:18:47.686 region:rollup2
COMPLEX IS THIS.

02:18:43.882 --> 02:18:49.588 region:rollup2
SO.

02:18:47.686 --> 02:18:52.324 region:rollup2
WHAT I WANT? TO SHARE GOING

02:18:49.588 --> 02:18:53.392 region:rollup2
FORWARD.

02:18:52.324 --> 02:18:55.761 region:rollup2
WHAT WE'VE OBSERVED A COUPLE OF

02:18:53.392 --> 02:18:57.296 region:rollup2
THINGS?

02:18:55.761 --> 02:18:58.831 region:rollup2
INTERNALLY WITH OUR STAFF.

02:18:57.296 --> 02:19:00.599 region:rollup2
.

02:18:58.831 --> 02:19:01.800 region:rollup2
BECAUSE

02:19:00.599 --> 02:19:03.669 region:rollup2
TO SOME DEGREE THE EXPERIENCE

02:19:01.800 --> 02:19:04.770 region:rollup2
HAS BEEN.

02:19:03.669 --> 02:19:06.838 region:rollup2
BECOME MORE COMMON.

02:19:04.770 --> 02:19:07.873 region:rollup2
.

02:19:06.838 --> 02:19:09.308 region:rollup2
NOT EVERYONE IS AVAILING

02:19:07.873 --> 02:19:11.443 region:rollup2
THEMSELVES OF THE KIND OF

02:19:09.308 --> 02:19:12.744 region:rollup2
SUPPORT THAT WE THOUGHT THEY

02:19:11.443 --> 02:19:15.414 region:rollup2
MIGHT NEED AND.

02:19:12.744 --> 02:19:18.050 region:rollup2
SO GOING FORWARD JUST JUST

02:19:15.414 --> 02:19:19.852 region:rollup2
RECENTLY REALIZED NO MAYBE.

02:19:18.050 --> 02:19:21.553 region:rollup2
CLINICIANS DON'T FEEL THAT THEY

02:19:19.852 --> 02:19:22.888 region:rollup2
NEED SUPPORT.

02:19:21.553 --> 02:19:25.224 region:rollup2
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THEY DON'T

02:19:22.888 --> 02:19:25.724 region:rollup2
HAVE STORIES TO SHARE AND SO

02:19:25.224 --> 02:19:27.326 region:rollup2
THAT'S HOW WE'RE KIND OF

02:19:25.724 --> 02:19:28.493 region:rollup2
SHIFTING.

02:19:27.326 --> 02:19:30.329 region:rollup2
OUR INTERACTION WITH OUR OWN

02:19:28.493 --> 02:19:31.563 region:rollup2
STAFF GOING FORWARD IS CREATING

PROFOUND ABOUT THE EXPERIENCE

INTERESTINGLY HERE.

02:21:08.026 --> 02:21:12.331 region:rollup2
HAVING EXPERIENCED A RECENT

02:21:10.829 --> 02:21:13.832 region:rollup2
LOSS MYSELF BEING ON THE

02:21:12.331 --> 02:21:15.300 region:rollup2
RECEIVING SIDE OF HOSPICE

A FEW MONTHS AGO. AFTER AN EIGHT

02:21:17.502 --> 02:21:20.505 region:rollup2
YEAR.

02:21:18.203 --> 02:21:23.241 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE OF STAGE FOUR CANCER

02:21:20.505 --> 02:21:24.409 region:rollup2
AND SO UP ALL OF THIS BECAME WAS

02:21:23.241 --> 02:21:26.812 region:rollup2
AYE I'VE DONE HOSPICE MY WHOLE

02:21:24.409 --> 02:21:28.780 region:rollup2
CAREER IN NURSING BUT AGAIN IT.

02:21:26.812 --> 02:21:30.849 region:rollup2
BECAME UP LESS ABOUT ABSTRACT

02:21:28.780 --> 02:21:32.217 region:rollup2
CONVERSATIONS THAN REALLY THE

02:21:30.849 --> 02:21:33.652 region:rollup2
REALITY OF THESE AND THE

02:21:32.217 --> 02:21:34.953 region:rollup2
IMPORTANCE OF ALL OF THE

02:21:33.652 --> 02:21:36.455 region:rollup2
CONVERSATIONS WE'VE DISCUSSED

02:21:34.953 --> 02:21:39.558 region:rollup2
TODAY.

02:21:36.455 --> 02:21:41.326 region:rollup2
I AND SO SOME OF MY OBSERVATIONS

02:21:39.558 --> 02:21:43.028 region:rollup2
FROM OUR EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN.

02:21:41.326 --> 02:21:44.796 region:rollup2
THAT REALLY THE QUALITY AND HOW

02:21:43.028 --> 02:21:45.764 region:rollup2
THAT'S DEFINED OF LOOK THE

02:21:44.796 --> 02:21:46.932 region:rollup2
QUALITY OF LIVING AND THE

02:21:45.764 --> 02:21:48.700 region:rollup2
QUALITY OF DYING IS A

02:21:46.932 --> 02:21:51.003 region:rollup2
FUNDAMENTALLY IN DEMAND INTIMATE

02:21:48.700 --> 02:21:52.537 region:rollup2
IN INDIVIDUALIZED DEFINITION AND

02:21:51.003 --> 02:21:54.539 region:rollup2
NO TWO ARE ALIKE.

02:21:52.537 --> 02:21:56.274 region:rollup2
AND WHY SOME PEOPLE MAY CHOOSE

02:21:54.539 --> 02:21:58.210 region:rollup2
TO SQUEEZE EVERY POSSIBLE DAY

02:21:56.274 --> 02:22:00.479 region:rollup2
FROM HERE.

02:21:58.210 --> 02:22:01.913 region:rollup2
FRAIL OF WORN OUT BODIES WHILE

02:22:00.479 --> 02:22:03.815 region:rollup2
OTHERS CHOOSE TO BE.

02:22:01.913 --> 02:22:05.317 region:rollup2
HAVE SELF DETERMINATION AND

02:22:03.815 --> 02:22:06.818 region:rollup2
CONTROL ABOUT THE TIMING OF THIS

02:22:05.317 --> 02:22:08.020 region:rollup2
PROCESS.

02:22:06.818 --> 02:22:09.788 region:rollup2
IS AT THIS POINT STILL

02:22:08.020 --> 02:22:11.456 region:rollup2
UNPREDICTABLE I THINK WE'VE SEEN

02:22:09.788 --> 02:22:13.125 region:rollup2
THE DATA WE SEE SOME OF THE

02:22:11.456 --> 02:22:14.426 region:rollup2
PROFILES BUT STILL I THINK

02:22:13.125 --> 02:22:17.129 region:rollup2
REALLY. IT WOULD BE HARD TO

02:22:14.426 --> 02:22:17.295 region:rollup2
PREDICT WHO'S LIKELY TO SELECT

02:22:17.129 --> 02:22:19.097 region:rollup2
THE.

02:22:17.295 --> 02:22:21.366 region:rollup2
THIS OPTION.

02:22:19.097 --> 02:22:24.136 region:rollup2
SO I IN BRIEF IN NINETEEN TWENTY

02:22:21.366 --> 02:22:25.804 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN WE HAD ABOUT FORTY

02:22:24.136 --> 02:22:28.306 region:rollup2
EIGHT ENQUIRIES ABOUT THE END OF

02:22:25.804 --> 02:22:30.308 region:rollup2
LIFE OPTION ACT. AND ABOUT EIGHT

02:22:28.306 --> 02:22:32.144 region:rollup2
PATIENTS HAVE ACTED UPON THIS

02:22:30.308 --> 02:22:33.879 region:rollup2
OPTION IN IN THE CALENDAR YEAR

02:22:32.144 --> 02:22:35.781 region:rollup2
TWENTY SEVENTEEN. OUR

02:22:33.879 --> 02:22:38.050 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATION STARTED WAY BEFORE

02:22:35.781 --> 02:22:39.985 region:rollup2
THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE LAW

02:22:38.050 --> 02:22:41.720 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE HAD NO.

02:22:39.985 --> 02:22:43.021 region:rollup2
IDEA WHAT TO EXPECT WHERE WHERE

02:22:41.720 --> 02:22:45.157 region:rollup2
PEOPLE GOING TO BE CALLING RIGHT

02:22:43.021 --> 02:22:45.757 region:rollup2
AWAY. HOW WAS THAT GOING TO PLAY

02:22:45.157 --> 02:22:46.625 region:rollup2
OUT THERE REALLY WASN'T A LOT

02:22:45.757 --> 02:22:49.461 region:rollup2
OF?

02:22:46.625 --> 02:22:51.396 region:rollup2
AWAY TO ANTICIPATE THAT SO I

02:22:49.461 --> 02:22:52.998 region:rollup2
THINK YOU KNOW SIMILAR TO LEE AS

02:22:51.396 --> 02:22:54.966 region:rollup2
MY COLLEAGUES WE BEGAN PLANNING

02:22:52.998 --> 02:22:57.202 region:rollup2
EARLY AND DEVELOPED. OF.

02:22:54.966 --> 02:23:00.038 region:rollup2
A TASK FORCE THAT WAS.

02:22:57.202 --> 02:23:02.074 region:rollup2
STAFF AND LEADERS OF ACROSS THE

02:23:00.038 --> 02:23:03.241 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATION. AND I HAVE I

02:23:02.074 --> 02:23:06.011 region:rollup2
HAPPEN TO COULD SHARE THAT WITH

02:23:03.241 --> 02:23:07.746 region:rollup2
OUR C. E. O. OUR BOARD WAS VERY

02:23:06.011 --> 02:23:10.148 region:rollup2
VERY INTERESTED IN THE SUBJECT

02:23:07.746 --> 02:23:11.917 region:rollup2
WE HAVE BROUGHT CONSULTANCY. UP

02:23:10.148 --> 02:23:13.285 region:rollup2
RETREATS ON THIS THEY WERE VERY

02:23:11.917 --> 02:23:15.654 region:rollup2
INTERESTED IN REALLY IMMERSING

02:23:13.285 --> 02:23:16.822 region:rollup2
THEMSELVES TO MAKE INFORMED

02:23:15.654 --> 02:23:19.224 region:rollup2
DECISIONS OR GUIDANCE.

02:23:16.822 --> 02:23:20.959 region:rollup2
WE CREATED A POSITION STATEMENT

02:23:19.224 --> 02:23:23.061 region:rollup2
POLICIES AND PROCEDURES.

02:23:20.959 --> 02:23:24.896 region:rollup2
DEVELOPED A PROCESS FOR

02:23:23.061 --> 02:23:26.898 region:rollup2
CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTION AND.

02:23:24.896 --> 02:23:28.633 region:rollup2
EVEN THAT PROCESS WENT THROUGH

02:23:26.898 --> 02:23:30.335 region:rollup2
SOME YOU KNOW WERE WE SUPPOSED

02:23:28.633 --> 02:23:32.437 region:rollup2
DID WE NEED A LIST OF WHO COULD

02:23:30.335 --> 02:23:34.139 region:rollup2
DO IT AT ANY GIVEN TIME PEOPLE

02:23:32.437 --> 02:23:35.507 region:rollup2
DIDN'T WANT TO BE ON A LIST. SO

02:23:34.139 --> 02:23:37.142 region:rollup2
IT'S WORKED OUT TO BE JUST AN

02:23:35.507 --> 02:23:38.844 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL CONVERSATION WITH THE

02:23:37.142 --> 02:23:41.213 region:rollup2
PERSON'S MANAGER AND IT'S WORKED

02:23:38.844 --> 02:23:43.682 region:rollup2
OUT FINE AND WE'VE NOT BEEN AT A

02:23:41.213 --> 02:23:45.484 region:rollup2
YACHT DEFICIT OF STAFF WILLING

02:23:43.682 --> 02:23:46.251 region:rollup2
TO. PARTICIPATE.

02:23:45.484 --> 02:23:49.354 region:rollup2
I SHOULD START BY SAYING THAT

02:23:46.251 --> 02:23:52.057 region:rollup2
OUR ORGANIZATION HAS A ADOPTED

02:23:49.354 --> 02:23:53.725 region:rollup2
THE STAND OF OF EDUCATION AND

02:23:52.057 --> 02:23:56.728 region:rollup2
SUPPORT BUT OUR PHYSICIANS DO

02:23:53.725 --> 02:23:59.564 region:rollup2
NOT PRESCRIBE THE MEDICATION. SO

02:23:56.728 --> 02:24:01.333 region:rollup2
WE'VE TAKEN A STEP TO. UP

02:23:59.564 --> 02:24:03.135 region:rollup2
PROVIDE RESOURCES AND EDUCATE

02:24:01.333 --> 02:24:04.469 region:rollup2
UPON REQUEST OR INCREASE ABOUT

02:24:03.135 --> 02:24:06.905 region:rollup2
THE ACT. AND.

02:24:04.469 --> 02:24:09.007 region:rollup2
A LOT OF THE STAFF NOW THAT

02:24:06.905 --> 02:24:10.275 region:rollup2
IT'S BECOME MORE COMMON IN OUR

02:24:09.007 --> 02:24:12.844 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY KNOW SOME OF THE

02:24:10.275 --> 02:24:13.879 region:rollup2
POSITIONS THAT ARE KNOWN TO UP

02:24:12.844 --> 02:24:15.313 region:rollup2
PERHAPS BE AVAILABLE TO THEM AS

02:24:13.879 --> 02:24:15.680 region:rollup2
CONSULTANTS.

02:24:15.313 --> 02:24:17.582 region:rollup2
AND.

02:24:15.680 --> 02:24:19.751 region:rollup2
AS THOUGH WE ALSO KIND OF WORK

02:24:17.582 --> 02:24:22.020 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE PROCESS OF STAFF AND

02:24:19.751 --> 02:24:24.122 region:rollup2
AND BEING PRESENT OR NOT. UP WE

02:24:22.020 --> 02:24:25.557 region:rollup2
HAD A COPY TALKS WAS THAT ARE

02:24:24.122 --> 02:24:27.158 region:rollup2
KIND OF OUR STRATEGY AT ALL OF

02:24:25.557 --> 02:24:28.994 region:rollup2
OUR DIFFERENT LOCATIONS FROM.

02:24:27.158 --> 02:24:31.196 region:rollup2
RIVERSIDE COUNTY THREE SAN DIEGO

02:24:28.994 --> 02:24:32.597 region:rollup2
THAT STAFF COULD COME AND OTHER

02:24:31.196 --> 02:24:35.333 region:rollup2
CREATE A SAFE SPACE TO DISCUSS

02:24:32.597 --> 02:24:38.036 region:rollup2
IT WITH THAT ASK ANY QUESTION.

02:24:35.333 --> 02:24:39.004 region:rollup2
WITH OUR POLICY YELLED.

02:24:38.036 --> 02:24:40.272 region:rollup2
AND IT CREATED AN ENVIRONMENT

02:24:39.004 --> 02:24:41.973 region:rollup2
FOR PEOPLE TO ASK THINGS THAT

02:24:40.272 --> 02:24:44.342 region:rollup2
THEY WERE PERHAPS

02:24:41.973 --> 02:24:45.377 region:rollup2
UNCOMFORTABLE ASKING AND JUST.

02:24:44.342 --> 02:24:47.646 region:rollup2
TO KIND OF TAKE IT OUT ON THAT

02:24:45.377 --> 02:24:50.215 region:rollup2
THIS CLOAK OF OF LIKE SOME SAID

02:24:47.646 --> 02:24:52.184 region:rollup2
SECRECY. OUT WE DID REQUIRED

02:24:50.215 --> 02:24:54.419 region:rollup2
EDUCATION FOR ALL OF OUR STAFF

02:24:52.184 --> 02:24:56.354 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE REALLY FELT. THAT THE

02:24:54.419 --> 02:24:57.489 region:rollup2
KNOWLEDGE WAS IMPORTANT SO THAT

02:24:56.354 --> 02:24:59.257 region:rollup2
WE DID HAVE SOME PEOPLE MAKING

02:24:57.489 --> 02:25:02.093 region:rollup2
ASSUMPTIONS OR OPERATING OFF

02:24:59.257 --> 02:25:04.262 region:rollup2
MISINFORMATION OR SIMPLY THEIR.

02:25:02.093 --> 02:25:06.531 region:rollup2
THEIR PERSONAL INTERPRETATION

02:25:04.262 --> 02:25:08.567 region:rollup2
OF WHAT THE LAW MEANT US SO THIS

02:25:06.531 --> 02:25:09.000 region:rollup2
TASK FORCE THAT CREATED ALL OF

02:25:08.567 --> 02:25:11.236 region:rollup2
THIS.

02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:12.871 region:rollup2
THAT SORT OF THE TOOL KIT SO TO

02:25:11.236 --> 02:25:14.806 region:rollup2
SPEAK AND THEN WE HAD QUESTION

02:25:12.871 --> 02:25:16.007 region:rollup2
AND ANSWER SESSIONS WE DID

02:25:14.806 --> 02:25:17.576 region:rollup2
DEVELOP A FREQUENTLY ASKED

02:25:16.007 --> 02:25:19.444 region:rollup2
QUESTION HAND OUT AND THAT'S

02:25:17.576 --> 02:25:21.346 region:rollup2
ALSO AVAILABLE FOR FAMILIES. AND

02:25:19.444 --> 02:25:22.881 region:rollup2
THEN DID TRAINING FOR ALL OF OUR

02:25:21.346 --> 02:25:24.549 region:rollup2
VOLUNTEERS AS WELL.

02:25:22.881 --> 02:25:27.085 region:rollup2
IN OUR ORGANIZATION THE SOCIAL

02:25:24.549 --> 02:25:28.887 region:rollup2
WORKERS HAVE BECOME THE PRIMARY.

02:25:27.085 --> 02:25:30.322 region:rollup2
THE PERSON IDENTIFIED WITHIN

02:25:28.887 --> 02:25:32.424 region:rollup2
THE TEAM TO.

02:25:30.322 --> 02:25:34.125 region:rollup2
GO OUT TO HAVE THE CONVERSATION

02:25:32.424 --> 02:25:36.027 region:rollup2
ONCE SOMEONE IS MADE AN INCREASE

02:25:34.125 --> 02:25:36.995 region:rollup2
BOTH THE.

02:25:36.027 --> 02:25:38.096 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE OPTION.

02:25:36.995 --> 02:25:39.564 region:rollup2
AND THEY PROVIDE THE EDUCATION

02:25:38.096 --> 02:25:40.966 region:rollup2
RESOURCES.

02:25:39.564 --> 02:25:42.767 region:rollup2
OF COURSE WE LOOKED AT ALL BUT

02:25:40.966 --> 02:25:44.536 region:rollup2
THE OTHER STATES IMPLEMENTED

02:25:42.767 --> 02:25:46.671 region:rollup2
LOOKED AT OTHERS DOCUMENTS IN A

02:25:44.536 --> 02:25:49.407 region:rollup2
SORT OF USE THOSE AS A JUMPING

02:25:46.671 --> 02:25:51.309 region:rollup2
OUTTA A JUMP START FOR HOURS.

02:25:49.407 --> 02:25:53.511 region:rollup2
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO

02:25:51.309 --> 02:25:55.347 region:rollup2
SIMPLY WISH WE HAD SOME RATHER

02:25:53.511 --> 02:25:57.549 region:rollup2
UNUSUAL AND UNEXPECTED THINGS

02:25:55.347 --> 02:25:58.883 region:rollup2
KIND OF AT THE VERY BEGINNING.

02:25:57.549 --> 02:25:59.985 region:rollup2
OF THE PROCESS THAT WE'RE REALLY

02:25:58.883 --> 02:26:02.087 region:rollup2
OUT OF OUR.

02:25:59.985 --> 02:26:03.722 region:rollup2
AT CONTROL. BUT ARE STILL

02:26:02.087 --> 02:26:05.023 region:rollup2
RATHER ODD IN PART OF OUR OUR

02:26:03.722 --> 02:26:06.891 region:rollup2
NARRATIVE.

02:26:05.023 --> 02:26:09.227 region:rollup2
I'VE RIGHT AROUND THE TIME WHEN

02:26:06.891 --> 02:26:11.496 region:rollup2
THE LAW BECAME ENACTED WE HAD.

02:26:09.227 --> 02:26:14.265 region:rollup2
THE PATIENT WHO ASKED ABOUT THE

02:26:11.496 --> 02:26:16.234 region:rollup2
LAW ASKED ABOUT THIS OPTION DOES

02:26:14.265 --> 02:26:17.769 region:rollup2
IT WAS. YOU KNOW FIVE AT NIGHT

02:26:16.234 --> 02:26:19.904 region:rollup2
SO SEWER CRANK CALLS SPOKE TO

02:26:17.769 --> 02:26:20.705 region:rollup2
THE GENTLEMAN KIND OF BRIEFLY

02:26:19.904 --> 02:26:22.774 region:rollup2
WENT OVER AT THE SET OUT.

02:26:20.705 --> 02:26:24.009 region:rollup2
GONNA SCHEDULED TO COME OUT

02:26:22.774 --> 02:26:26.711 region:rollup2
TOMORROW.

02:26:24.009 --> 02:26:27.712 region:rollup2
BRAND NEW PATIENT WELL THIS DOWN

02:26:26.711 --> 02:26:29.247 region:rollup2
AND TOOK HIS OWN LIFE.

02:26:27.712 --> 02:26:30.582 region:rollup2
AND WAS THAT FOUND WHEN THE

02:26:29.247 --> 02:26:32.550 region:rollup2
STAFF.

02:26:30.582 --> 02:26:34.586 region:rollup2
WENT OUT THE NEXT MORNING AND OF

02:26:32.550 --> 02:26:36.087 region:rollup2
COURSE. IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO

02:26:34.586 --> 02:26:37.689 region:rollup2
EXTRAPOLATE WHAT THAT WAS ABOUT

02:26:36.087 --> 02:26:39.124 region:rollup2
HE HADN'T BEEN ON SERVICE TO

02:26:37.689 --> 02:26:41.292 region:rollup2
REALLY ASSESS BUT.

02:26:39.124 --> 02:26:43.161 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATELY CREATED A

02:26:41.292 --> 02:26:45.664 region:rollup2
TRIGGERED OF COURSE THE. THE.

02:26:43.161 --> 02:26:48.333 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THAT COUNTY CAME IN

02:26:45.664 --> 02:26:48.933 region:rollup2
DIDN'T VESTED GAUGE CHEN. AND

02:26:48.333 --> 02:26:49.934 region:rollup2
WHAT IT REVEALED TO US THOUGH

02:26:48.933 --> 02:26:51.636 region:rollup2
WHICH IS.

02:26:49.934 --> 02:26:52.537 region:rollup2
LATER WHEN MY RECOMMENDATIONS IS

02:26:51.636 --> 02:26:55.206 region:rollup2
THAT THE.

02:26:52.537 --> 02:26:56.474 region:rollup2
IN ANY OF THE COMMUNITIES I

02:26:55.206 --> 02:26:58.476 region:rollup2
THINK IN CALIFORNIA THAT THAT

02:26:56.474 --> 02:26:59.678 region:rollup2
WITH A LOCAL AND. STATE HEALTH

02:26:58.476 --> 02:27:01.346 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OR YOUNG PUBLIC HELP

02:26:59.678 --> 02:27:02.514 region:rollup2
THEY REALLY NEED TO UNDERSTAND

02:27:01.346 --> 02:27:05.250 region:rollup2
THIS BECAUSE IF THEY'RE COMING

02:27:02.514 --> 02:27:07.786 region:rollup2
INTO SURVEY HOSPICES. THEY HAD

02:27:05.250 --> 02:27:09.988 region:rollup2
ABSOLUTELY NO KNOWLEDGE OR

02:27:07.786 --> 02:27:11.523 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING OF IT SO EVEN

02:27:09.988 --> 02:27:13.124 region:rollup2
THOUGH THIS WASN'T.

02:27:11.523 --> 02:27:14.926 region:rollup2
SOMEONE CHOOSING AND GOING

02:27:13.124 --> 02:27:17.028 region:rollup2
THROUGH WITH THAT IT GOT TANGLED

02:27:14.926 --> 02:27:18.296 region:rollup2
UP IN IT IN A SENSE.

02:27:17.028 --> 02:27:20.165 region:rollup2
SO I THINK THAT'S AND I'M AN

02:27:18.296 --> 02:27:21.299 region:rollup2
ACTION STEP THAT WOULD AGAIN AS

02:27:20.165 --> 02:27:23.535 region:rollup2
THEY'RE COMING IN FOR OTHER

02:27:21.299 --> 02:27:25.937 region:rollup2
ISSUES WITH HOSPICES CREATE LESS

02:27:23.535 --> 02:27:27.238 region:rollup2
OF IT I MEAN ADVERSARIAL PUT PUT

02:27:25.937 --> 02:27:28.573 region:rollup2
THEM IN THE CONTEXT OF BEING

02:27:27.238 --> 02:27:30.141 region:rollup2
INFORMED.

02:27:28.573 --> 02:27:31.476 region:rollup2
SO.

02:27:30.141 --> 02:27:34.279 region:rollup2
BUT THIS.

02:27:31.476 --> 02:27:36.147 region:rollup2
THIS ACTUALLY REQUIRED THAT WE

02:27:34.279 --> 02:27:38.483 region:rollup2
PUT INTO PROCESS

02:27:36.147 --> 02:27:38.983 region:rollup2
A SITUATION OF DOING OF SUICIDE

02:27:38.483 --> 02:27:40.885 region:rollup2
RISK ASSESSMENTS ON OUR

02:27:38.983 --> 02:27:42.220 region:rollup2
PATIENTS.

02:27:40.885 --> 02:27:43.822 region:rollup2
SO THAT OF NOT THAT THEY

02:27:42.220 --> 02:27:46.691 region:rollup2
WOULDN'T IN A ROUTINE MATTER BUT

02:27:43.822 --> 02:27:47.992 region:rollup2
IN A VERY FOCUSED WAY SO NOW WE

02:27:46.691 --> 02:27:49.494 region:rollup2
HAVE A PROCESS THAT THERE'S A

02:27:47.992 --> 02:27:52.497 region:rollup2
BRIEF SUICIDE RISK ASSESSMENT

02:27:49.494 --> 02:27:54.833 region:rollup2
FOR ALL. NEW ADMISSIONS AND THEN

02:27:52.497 --> 02:27:58.169 region:rollup2
IF THEY DO REQUEST INFORMATION

02:27:54.833 --> 02:27:59.804 region:rollup2
REQUIRE ABOUT THE. ACT WE DO A

02:27:58.169 --> 02:28:02.006 region:rollup2
MORE IN DEPTH.

02:27:59.804 --> 02:28:04.275 region:rollup2
ASSESSMENT I MUST SAY THAT IT

02:28:02.006 --> 02:28:06.111 region:rollup2
IS NOT DONE IN A IN A MEAN STUFF

02:28:04.275 --> 02:28:08.446 region:rollup2
THAT IT'S PUNITIVE OR A

02:28:06.111 --> 02:28:11.082 region:rollup2
DETERRENT TO IT. BUT SIMPLY AS

02:28:08.446 --> 02:28:12.717 region:rollup2
RISK AVERSION BECAUSE OF THIS WE

02:28:11.082 --> 02:28:14.953 region:rollup2
HAD A FEW.

02:28:12.717 --> 02:28:16.855 region:rollup2
SUICIDES ALL IN A CLOSE PERIOD

02:28:14.953 --> 02:28:18.590 region:rollup2
OF TIME THAT I THINK WERE NOT

02:28:16.855 --> 02:28:20.625 region:rollup2
RELATED TO.

02:28:18.590 --> 02:28:22.961 region:rollup2
PURSUING THE LEGAL PROCESS IN

02:28:20.625 --> 02:28:24.863 region:rollup2
THE MEDICATION BUT PUT IT IN THE

02:28:22.961 --> 02:28:25.697 region:rollup2
CONTEXT OF A MORE RIGOROUS

02:28:24.863 --> 02:28:27.632 region:rollup2
SCRUTINY.

02:28:25.697 --> 02:28:29.400 region:rollup2
SO.

02:28:27.632 --> 02:28:31.503 region:rollup2
BUT THE GOOD PART IS THAT IT

02:28:29.400 --> 02:28:32.070 region:rollup2
YIELDED SOME INCREDIBLE

02:28:31.503 --> 02:28:33.738 region:rollup2
CONVERSATIONS WITH FAMILIES

02:28:32.070 --> 02:28:35.340 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:28:33.738 --> 02:28:36.174 region:rollup2
THEY HAD SOME HAD BEEN SECRETLY

02:28:35.340 --> 02:28:38.376 region:rollup2
THINKING ABOUT.

02:28:36.174 --> 02:28:40.211 region:rollup2
AID IN DYING NEVER TALKED ABOUT

02:28:38.376 --> 02:28:42.380 region:rollup2
IT IT SORT OF OPENED UP THE

02:28:40.211 --> 02:28:44.416 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE DISCUSSIONS

02:28:42.380 --> 02:28:45.683 region:rollup2
ABOUT WILL. RENO TELL ME MORE

02:28:44.416 --> 02:28:46.985 region:rollup2
WHAT ARE YOU CONCERNED ABOUT ONE

02:28:45.683 --> 02:28:48.787 region:rollup2
OF THE THINGS YOU'RE CONCERNED

02:28:46.985 --> 02:28:50.388 region:rollup2
THAT MIGHT HAPPEN DOWN THE ROAD.

02:28:48.787 --> 02:28:53.224 region:rollup2
SO WE FOUND THAT THERE A LOT

02:28:50.388 --> 02:28:54.292 region:rollup2
MORE PEOPLE. INQUIRING ABOUT IT

02:28:53.224 --> 02:28:55.660 region:rollup2
THAN ACTUALLY CARING THROUGH

02:28:54.292 --> 02:28:57.462 region:rollup2
WITH IT.

02:28:55.660 --> 02:28:59.564 region:rollup2
BUT I DO THINK THAT IT'S THE

02:28:57.462 --> 02:29:02.367 region:rollup2
WHOLE PROCESS HAS YIELDED MORE

02:28:59.564 --> 02:29:04.903 region:rollup2
IN DEPTH CONVERSATIONS ABOUT.

02:29:02.367 --> 02:29:05.937 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT THOSE OF FEARS AND

02:29:04.903 --> 02:29:08.039 region:rollup2
CONCERNS SOME OF THE CHARM

02:29:05.937 --> 02:29:09.674 region:rollup2
REALISTIC SUMMER NOT WHAT OTHER

02:29:08.039 --> 02:29:11.476 region:rollup2
WAYS CAN WE ASSIST PEOPLE THAT

02:29:09.674 --> 02:29:13.211 region:rollup2
HAVE CONTROL IN THEIR LIVES.

02:29:11.476 --> 02:29:15.447 region:rollup2
THIS IS LARGELY I THINK ABOUT

02:29:13.211 --> 02:29:16.448 region:rollup2
CONTROL AND SO WHAT ARE WAYS

02:29:15.447 --> 02:29:18.316 region:rollup2
THAT WE CAN HELP ENHANCE.

02:29:16.448 --> 02:29:20.718 region:rollup2
CONTROL IN THE LIVES OF THE

02:29:18.316 --> 02:29:23.655 region:rollup2
PEOPLE THAT WERE SERVING.

02:29:20.718 --> 02:29:24.722 region:rollup2
SO THIS WE DID A LOT OF

02:29:23.655 --> 02:29:26.724 region:rollup2
TRAINING WITH OURS ARE SUCH

02:29:24.722 --> 02:29:28.760 region:rollup2
WORKERS ON THIS PROCESS. AND AT

02:29:26.724 --> 02:29:30.295 region:rollup2
FIRST I FELT LIKE IT WAS.

02:29:28.760 --> 02:29:30.728 region:rollup2
I THINK THEY WERE CONCERNED IT

02:29:30.295 --> 02:29:33.398 region:rollup2
WOULD BE.

02:29:30.728 --> 02:29:36.234 region:rollup2
OBSTRUCTIVE BUT IT IS NOT.

02:29:33.398 --> 02:29:37.802 region:rollup2
DEMONSTRATED THAT IN OUR PROCESS

02:29:36.234 --> 02:29:38.837 region:rollup2
SO I THINK WHAT IT HAS HEALED IT

02:29:37.802 --> 02:29:41.105 region:rollup2
IS THE RICHNESS OF THE

02:29:38.837 --> 02:29:42.941 region:rollup2
CONVERSATIONS REGARDLESS OF THE

02:29:41.105 --> 02:29:44.776 region:rollup2
FAMILY'S CHOICE TO THE PATIENT'S

02:29:42.941 --> 02:29:46.377 region:rollup2
CHOICE TO CONTINUE OR NOT. ALONG

02:29:44.776 --> 02:29:47.846 region:rollup2
THIS LEGAL PAD.

02:29:46.377 --> 02:29:49.180 region:rollup2
IT'S UP ONE OF THE THINGS I

02:29:47.846 --> 02:29:49.547 region:rollup2
ALWAYS REFERRED TO AS A KIND OF

02:29:49.180 --> 02:29:51.449 region:rollup2
ALLOWED WHAT.

02:29:49.547 --> 02:29:52.717 region:rollup2
DOCTOR I REPLY ACT REFERRED TO

02:29:51.449 --> 02:29:54.953 region:rollup2
AS THE FOUR THINGS THAT MATTER

02:29:52.717 --> 02:29:55.887 region:rollup2
MOST THAT IN WHATEVER TIME THEY

02:29:54.953 --> 02:29:57.488 region:rollup2
HAVE LEFT.

02:29:55.887 --> 02:29:59.357 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE THOSE I THINK OTHERS

02:29:57.488 --> 02:30:01.159 region:rollup2
HAVE DISGUSTED ABOUT YOU KNOW

02:29:59.357 --> 02:30:02.660 region:rollup2
FINDING MEANING IN THEIR LIFE

02:30:01.159 --> 02:30:05.063 region:rollup2
HAVING OPPORTUNITIES FOR.

02:30:02.660 --> 02:30:07.765 region:rollup2
BEING ABLE TO OFFER FORGIVENESS

02:30:05.063 --> 02:30:10.134 region:rollup2
ACCEPT FORGIVENESS GRATITUDE AT

02:30:07.765 --> 02:30:11.836 region:rollup2
CETERA. DOT AND THE OTHER.

02:30:10.134 --> 02:30:13.571 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE THAT WE SAW THAT

02:30:11.836 --> 02:30:15.640 region:rollup2
AGAIN JUST I THINK FOR

02:30:13.571 --> 02:30:17.742 region:rollup2
TRANSPARENCY IS THAT.

02:30:15.640 --> 02:30:19.143 region:rollup2
WE THEIR THE LAW DOES GIVE THE

02:30:17.742 --> 02:30:21.312 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL THE OPTION TO HAVE

02:30:19.143 --> 02:30:22.881 region:rollup2
COMPLETE PRIVACY SO NO ONE ELSE

02:30:21.312 --> 02:30:25.984 region:rollup2
NEEDS TO KNOW AND OF COURSE THE

02:30:22.881 --> 02:30:27.719 region:rollup2
HOSPICE TEAM. RESPECT THAT IN RD

02:30:25.984 --> 02:30:29.521 region:rollup2
BRIEFS WITH THE STAFF WHICH WE

02:30:27.719 --> 02:30:31.122 region:rollup2
TRY TO DEBRIEF INDIVIDUALLY WITH

02:30:29.521 --> 02:30:33.591 region:rollup2
EACH THAT CASE BUT AGAIN DOES

02:30:31.122 --> 02:30:35.159 region:rollup2
SORT OF GO. OFTEN IS MORE

02:30:33.591 --> 02:30:37.228 region:rollup2
INFORMAL AS TIME GOES ON. BUT

02:30:35.159 --> 02:30:39.931 region:rollup2
THAT IT SEEMS THAT IT DID

02:30:37.228 --> 02:30:41.499 region:rollup2
BECAUSE MORE DISTRESSED WHEN THE

02:30:39.931 --> 02:30:44.235 region:rollup2
FAMILY MEMBERS ADULT FAMILY

02:30:41.499 --> 02:30:46.304 region:rollup2
MEMBERS WERE NOT. ALLOWED TO BE

02:30:44.235 --> 02:30:48.206 region:rollup2
INFORMED AND YOU KNOW FLUENT AT

02:30:46.304 --> 02:30:49.841 region:rollup2
THE LAST MINUTE OR WAS KIND OF A

02:30:48.206 --> 02:30:51.676 region:rollup2
FIRE DRILL KIND THAT THE LAST.

02:30:49.841 --> 02:30:53.478 region:rollup2
AND SO WE WILL COURSE HONOR

02:30:51.676 --> 02:30:54.779 region:rollup2
THEIR WISHES AND THEIR

02:30:53.478 --> 02:30:55.980 region:rollup2
PREFERENCES BUT THE SUCH WORKERS

02:30:54.779 --> 02:30:57.482 region:rollup2
HAVE COMMENTED THAT IT DID MAKE

02:30:55.980 --> 02:30:59.417 region:rollup2
IT A LITTLE BIT MORE COMPLICATED

02:30:57.482 --> 02:31:01.419 region:rollup2
WHEN. FAMILY MEMBERS WHO WEREN'T

02:30:59.417 --> 02:31:03.454 region:rollup2
PART OF THAT DISCUSSION WHETHER

02:31:01.419 --> 02:31:06.157 region:rollup2
THEY ALL AGREED OR NOT IT JUST

02:31:03.454 --> 02:31:10.261 region:rollup2
HAVE NOT HAD AN OPPORTUNITY FOR

02:31:06.157 --> 02:31:11.229 region:rollup2
THEIR MAYBE GOODBYES ARE THERE

02:31:10.261 --> 02:31:12.063 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO.

02:31:11.229 --> 02:31:14.465 region:rollup2
JUST COLLECTIVELY HAVE THAT A

02:31:12.063 --> 02:31:17.035 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT CONVERSATION SO THEY

02:31:14.465 --> 02:31:18.303 region:rollup2
AYE. THE SUMMARY THAT I GOT FROM

02:31:17.035 --> 02:31:20.305 region:rollup2
THE SOCIAL WORKERS IN THERE ON

02:31:18.303 --> 02:31:22.173 region:rollup2
MY INTERVIEWS WITH THEM IS THAT

02:31:20.305 --> 02:31:23.207 region:rollup2
THE WHEN IT IS PLANNED WHEN

02:31:22.173 --> 02:31:24.909 region:rollup2
THERE IS SOME THOUGHTFUL

02:31:23.207 --> 02:31:26.978 region:rollup2
DIALOGUE AMONG THE. FAMILY

02:31:24.909 --> 02:31:29.080 region:rollup2
MEMBERS THAT THE FAMILY MEMBERS

02:31:26.978 --> 02:31:31.516 region:rollup2
TO AND. FOR THE MOST PART EVEN

02:31:29.080 --> 02:31:32.784 region:rollup2
IF THEY DON'T AGREE MAY SUPPORT

02:31:31.516 --> 02:31:33.785 region:rollup2
THE PATIENT'S WISHES BECAUSE

02:31:32.784 --> 02:31:34.285 region:rollup2
THEY AT LEAST UNDERSTAND THE

02:31:33.785 --> 02:31:35.420 region:rollup2
CONTEXT

02:31:34.285 --> 02:31:37.789 region:rollup2
BETTER.

02:31:35.420 --> 02:31:39.257 region:rollup2
.

02:31:37.789 --> 02:31:42.293 region:rollup2
SO AGAIN WE'RE WE AREN'T.

02:31:39.257 --> 02:31:44.028 region:rollup2
PRESCRIBING BUT WE DID HAVE OUR

02:31:42.293 --> 02:31:45.463 region:rollup2
ONE OF OUR VERY FIRST OF THAT

02:31:44.028 --> 02:31:46.864 region:rollup2
WENT THROUGH THE PROCESS OF THE

02:31:45.463 --> 02:31:48.299 region:rollup2
PROCESS WITH THE PRESCRIPTION

02:31:46.864 --> 02:31:50.468 region:rollup2
AND THAT THE MEDICATION.

02:31:48.299 --> 02:31:51.736 region:rollup2
ENDED UP TO BE SOMEONE WHO

02:31:50.468 --> 02:31:53.371 region:rollup2
WASN'T A DOCTOR WAS A

02:31:51.736 --> 02:31:56.374 region:rollup2
CHIROPRACTOR.

02:31:53.371 --> 02:31:57.742 region:rollup2
AND THE PATIENT WOKE UP ABOUT A

02:31:56.374 --> 02:32:00.144 region:rollup2
LIKE A COUPLE HOURS LATER AND

02:31:57.742 --> 02:32:01.913 region:rollup2
CREATED A LOT OF DISTRESS AND.

02:32:00.144 --> 02:32:03.614 region:rollup2
WHAT HAVE YOU AND SO AS A RESULT

02:32:01.913 --> 02:32:05.116 region:rollup2
WE CHANGED OUR PRACTICE

02:32:03.614 --> 02:32:07.318 region:rollup2
A SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU'RE DOING

02:32:05.116 --> 02:32:08.853 region:rollup2
IS THAT NOW IF THE FAMILY WANTS

02:32:07.318 --> 02:32:10.521 region:rollup2
US TO BE THERE WE WILL SO THAT

02:32:08.853 --> 02:32:11.589 region:rollup2
WE CAN IMPLEMENT SYMPTOM

02:32:10.521 --> 02:32:13.458 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT?

02:32:11.589 --> 02:32:15.259 region:rollup2
IN A WAY PALETTE OF SYMPTOM

02:32:13.458 --> 02:32:15.793 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT AND BE PRESENT SO WE

02:32:15.259 --> 02:32:17.195 region:rollup2
TO.

02:32:15.793 --> 02:32:18.763 region:rollup2
REQUIRE THAT SOMEONE ELSE BE

02:32:17.195 --> 02:32:20.798 region:rollup2
THERE WITH THE PATIENTS SO

02:32:18.763 --> 02:32:22.300 region:rollup2
THEY'RE NOT THERE ALONE BUT THAT

02:32:20.798 --> 02:32:23.501 region:rollup2
OUR THE BOARD AND OUR

02:32:22.300 --> 02:32:24.602 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION FELT STRONGLY

02:32:23.501 --> 02:32:25.703 region:rollup2
THAT IT. OTHER THAN THAT IT

02:32:24.602 --> 02:32:28.039 region:rollup2
WOULD CREATE A SENSE OF

02:32:25.703 --> 02:32:30.208 region:rollup2
ABANDONMENT FOR WHAT THE PATIENT

02:32:28.039 --> 02:32:30.975 region:rollup2
AT THAT TIME SO WE WOULD EVEN

02:32:30.208 --> 02:32:33.544 region:rollup2
INSTITUTE.

02:32:30.975 --> 02:32:35.013 region:rollup2
CRISIS CARE WHICH IS A BENEFIT

02:32:33.544 --> 02:32:36.481 region:rollup2
OF THE MEDICARE BENEFIT IF THEY

02:32:35.013 --> 02:32:37.081 region:rollup2
HAVE.

02:32:36.481 --> 02:32:38.583 region:rollup2
ACUTE SYMPTOMS THAT NEEDED TO

02:32:37.081 --> 02:32:41.452 region:rollup2
BE.

02:32:38.583 --> 02:32:42.987 region:rollup2
OP MANAGED SO. I THINK.

02:32:41.452 --> 02:32:44.722 region:rollup2
IN SUMMARY I THINK THE

02:32:42.987 --> 02:32:47.392 region:rollup2
REFLECTION IS THAT I THINK IT IS

02:32:44.722 --> 02:32:48.693 region:rollup2
TO THE DEGREE THAT ONE WOULD BE.

02:32:47.392 --> 02:32:51.095 region:rollup2
ENCOURAGED TO INCLUDE FAMILY

02:32:48.693 --> 02:32:53.831 region:rollup2
MEMBERS THAT'S OPTIMAL OUTCOME

02:32:51.095 --> 02:32:55.833 region:rollup2
FOR PERHAPS FOR EVERYONE. AND I

02:32:53.831 --> 02:32:57.702 region:rollup2
THINK THAT WHAT I'D LIKE TO SEE

02:32:55.833 --> 02:32:59.170 region:rollup2
IS IT WAS MAYBE MENTIONED BUT I

02:32:57.702 --> 02:33:01.172 region:rollup2
THINK ALL AND I'M SPEAKING AS A

02:32:59.170 --> 02:33:02.507 region:rollup2
HOSPICE PROVIDER. I THINK THAT

02:33:01.172 --> 02:33:04.742 region:rollup2
ALL THE HOSPICE PROGRAM SHOULD

02:33:02.507 --> 02:33:07.945 region:rollup2
BE REQUIRED TO USE THE SAME

02:33:04.742 --> 02:33:10.782 region:rollup2
TRACKING TOOL. OF FROM START TO

02:33:07.945 --> 02:33:12.316 region:rollup2
FINISH OF UP YOU KNOW.

02:33:10.782 --> 02:33:13.885 region:rollup2
HOW MANY INCREASE ARE THERE?

02:33:12.316 --> 02:33:15.586 region:rollup2
WHAT'S THE DISPOSITION DO THEY

02:33:13.885 --> 02:33:17.422 region:rollup2
GET A MEDICATION DO THEY NOT DO

02:33:15.586 --> 02:33:19.290 region:rollup2
THEY USE IT DO THEY NOT SO THAT

02:33:17.422 --> 02:33:20.792 region:rollup2
WE HAVE WE'RE ALL TRACKING THE

02:33:19.290 --> 02:33:22.727 region:rollup2
SAME INFORMATION AND I THINK

02:33:20.792 --> 02:33:24.662 region:rollup2
THAT WILL JUST CONTINUE TO

02:33:22.727 --> 02:33:26.064 region:rollup2
INFORM THE PROCESS.

02:33:24.662 --> 02:33:28.332 region:rollup2
AND POSSIBLY EVEN THE

02:33:26.064 --> 02:33:30.368 region:rollup2
BEREAVEMENT OUTCOMES ALTHOUGH

02:33:28.332 --> 02:33:31.202 region:rollup2
THAT IS MORE LONG TERM BUT IT

02:33:30.368 --> 02:33:33.805 region:rollup2
COURSE JUST THE IMMEDIATE.

02:33:31.202 --> 02:33:35.306 region:rollup2
IMPLICATIONS PERHAPS JUST TO

02:33:33.805 --> 02:33:36.641 region:rollup2
KIND OF GET A SENSE OF THAT. AND

02:33:35.306 --> 02:33:38.176 region:rollup2
AGAIN AS I SAID TRAINING ON THE

02:33:36.641 --> 02:33:38.676 region:rollup2
LOCAL LEVEL FOR THOSE WHO MAY BE

02:33:38.176 --> 02:33:40.411 region:rollup2
SURVEYING INVESTIGATING

02:33:38.676 --> 02:33:42.146 region:rollup2
HOSPICES.

02:33:40.411 --> 02:33:44.182 region:rollup2
AND PERHAPS GREATER TRANSPARENCY

02:33:42.146 --> 02:33:45.683 region:rollup2
WITH A HOSPICE PROVIDER ON WHAT

02:33:44.182 --> 02:33:47.552 region:rollup2
THE MEDICATION IS THAT WILL BE

02:33:45.683 --> 02:33:48.953 region:rollup2
GIVEN SO THAT SHOULD PROBLEMS

02:33:47.552 --> 02:33:50.555 region:rollup2
ARISE. WE CAN BE IS.

02:33:48.953 --> 02:33:51.889 region:rollup2
EFFICIENT AS POSSIBLE AND

02:33:50.555 --> 02:33:54.492 region:rollup2
HELPING.

02:33:51.889 --> 02:33:55.693 region:rollup2
IN EVALUATING THE EFFICACY OF

02:33:54.492 --> 02:33:58.196 region:rollup2
WHATEVER THE MEDICATION

02:33:55.693 --> 02:33:59.564 region:rollup2
COMBINATION IS SO WHILE PATIENTS

02:33:58.196 --> 02:34:01.499 region:rollup2
ARE ALLOWED TO PURSUE ALL THE

02:33:59.564 --> 02:34:03.067 region:rollup2
LEGAL OPTIONS. AS OTHERS HAVE

02:34:01.499 --> 02:34:05.269 region:rollup2
STEP SAID IT'S STILL THIS

02:34:03.067 --> 02:34:07.972 region:rollup2
CRITICAL NEED FOR OUR SYSTEMS TO

02:34:05.269 --> 02:34:09.640 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO BE AGGRESSIVE IN THE

02:34:07.972 --> 02:34:11.209 region:rollup2
TRAINING REQUIREMENTS FOR ALL

02:34:09.640 --> 02:34:14.011 region:rollup2
THE HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS AS

02:34:11.209 --> 02:34:16.147 region:rollup2
WELL AS. THE GENERAL PUBLIC I DO

02:34:14.011 --> 02:34:17.849 region:rollup2
THINK THERE'S A REAL. LACK OF

02:34:16.147 --> 02:34:19.083 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING OF.

02:34:17.849 --> 02:34:21.452 region:rollup2
WHAT EITHER WHAT IT MEANS OR

02:34:19.083 --> 02:34:23.187 region:rollup2
THAT IT DOESN'T?

02:34:21.452 --> 02:34:25.623 region:rollup2
IT THAT THERE'S A PROCESS IN WHO

02:34:23.187 --> 02:34:27.592 region:rollup2
QUALIFIES SO WE DO A LOT OF

02:34:25.623 --> 02:34:29.494 region:rollup2
EDUCATION ON THAT. YOU FOUND

02:34:27.592 --> 02:34:31.262 region:rollup2
THAT SO I THINK SAFE. DIGNIFIED

02:34:29.494 --> 02:34:32.463 region:rollup2
END OF LIFE CARE FOR ALL AND THE

02:34:31.262 --> 02:34:34.499 region:rollup2
MAJORITY OF PATIENTS MAY NOT

02:34:32.463 --> 02:34:35.633 region:rollup2
PURSUE THIS BUT THAT WE NEED TO

02:34:34.499 --> 02:34:37.835 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO BE DIPPING

02:34:35.633 --> 02:34:39.937 region:rollup2
AGGRESSIVE IN THAT CARE AND

02:34:37.835 --> 02:34:41.139 region:rollup2
SERVICES THAT WE DO PROVIDE. FOR

02:34:39.937 --> 02:34:42.573 region:rollup2
OUR FAMILIES.

02:34:41.139 --> 02:34:44.509 region:rollup2
AND CONTINUE TO PROVIDE

02:34:42.573 --> 02:34:46.310 region:rollup2
EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES AS

02:34:44.509 --> 02:34:49.013 region:rollup2
OTHERS ARE DOING THAT WE. OUGHT

02:34:46.310 --> 02:34:50.114 region:rollup2
THAT WE'RE ALSO DOING SO I THINK

02:34:49.013 --> 02:34:51.749 region:rollup2
THOSE ARE THE TOP

02:34:50.114 --> 02:34:53.851 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT.

02:34:51.749 --> 02:34:56.521 region:rollup2
THAT I CAN SEE SO THAT WE'RE

02:34:53.851 --> 02:34:58.790 region:rollup2
CONTINUING TO SERVE OUR PATIENTS

02:34:56.521 --> 02:35:00.525 region:rollup2
IN BODY MIND AND SPIRIT ACROSS

02:34:58.790 --> 02:35:02.260 region:rollup2
THE CONTINUUM FOR PALLIATIVE

02:35:00.525 --> 02:35:04.295 region:rollup2
CARE THROUGH END OF LIFE CARE.

02:35:02.260 --> 02:35:05.930 region:rollup2
SO THAT ALL OUR PATIENTS

02:35:04.295 --> 02:35:07.965 region:rollup2
REGARDLESS OF THEIR CHOICES.

02:35:05.930 --> 02:35:09.967 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE LAST SUFFERING LESS

02:35:07.965 --> 02:35:11.736 region:rollup2
FEAR AND CAN FEEL CONFIDENT IN

02:35:09.967 --> 02:35:12.336 region:rollup2
THE CARE GIVERS THAT ARE

02:35:11.736 --> 02:35:13.538 region:rollup2
SURROUNDING THEM IN THIS TIME

02:35:12.336 --> 02:35:14.806 region:rollup2

OTHER MEMBERS LEFT AS A LACK OF

SOCIAL WORKER AND.

02:35:29.654 --> 02:35:33.758 region:rollup2
WHEN I STARTED THIS STEPPED UP

02:35:32.456 --> 02:35:35.726 region:rollup2
PEOPLE I HEARD THE MOST NEGATIVE

02:35:33.758 --> 02:35:37.094 region:rollup2
FEEDBACK FROM MY FORMER HOSPICE

02:35:35.726 --> 02:35:38.963 region:rollup2
COLLEAGUES AND BECAUSE THERE HAS

02:35:37.094 --> 02:35:40.498 region:rollup2
LONG BEEN KIND OF THE. PEOPLE I

02:35:38.963 --> 02:35:41.899 region:rollup2
THINK OFTEN THINK HOSPICES WOULD

02:35:40.498 --> 02:35:43.201 region:rollup2
BE THE MOST ACCEPTING OF

02:35:41.899 --> 02:35:44.335 region:rollup2
SOMETHING LIKE THIS BUT

02:35:43.201 --> 02:35:46.137 region:rollup2
OFTENTIMES BECAUSE THEY HAVE

02:35:44.335 --> 02:35:47.872 region:rollup2
BEEN DOING THE VERY HANDS ON

02:35:46.137 --> 02:35:49.307 region:rollup2
WORK FOR SO LONG. IT IS A A

02:35:47.872 --> 02:35:51.475 region:rollup2
TOTAL SHIFT TO THINK ABOUT

02:35:49.307 --> 02:35:53.110 region:rollup2
SOMETHING A DIFFERENT WAY SO I

02:35:51.475 --> 02:35:54.745 region:rollup2
KNOW THE STRUGGLE INTERNALLY. IN

02:35:53.110 --> 02:35:56.547 region:rollup2
THE ORGANIZATION INJURING TO

THIS OPTION ANNA HUMANE CARING

02:36:09.327 --> 02:36:12.597 region:rollup2
PASSION THINKING AND I THINK

02:36:10.862 --> 02:36:14.865 region:rollup2
IT'S BEEN CONSISTENT ACROSS

02:36:12.597 --> 02:36:15.833 region:rollup2
PRESENTATIONS ABOUT.

02:36:14.865 --> 02:36:17.802 region:rollup2
THAT MORE DATA WOULD BE VERY

02:36:15.833 --> 02:36:18.870 region:rollup2
HELPFUL BOMB AND MANY ROOM AND

02:36:17.802 --> 02:36:20.271 region:rollup2
WE HAVE SOME WORK TO DO WITH

02:36:18.870 --> 02:36:21.806 region:rollup2
PUBLIC HEALTH AND DIE AND I

02:36:20.271 --> 02:36:23.107 region:rollup2
THINK SOME OF THE A BOMB THE

02:36:21.806 --> 02:36:24.675 region:rollup2
FORMS THAT ARE SUBMITTED AND HOW

02:36:23.107 --> 02:36:25.309 region:rollup2

THEY'RE ALL COMPLETE AND HONEY

02:36:25.309 --> 02:36:28.412 region:rollup2
AND SHIRTS ALL REPORTED. AND

02:36:27.278 --> 02:36:29.914 region:rollup2
THEN THE ACROSS SYSTEM STUFF AS

02:36:28.412 --> 02:36:31.549 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IS EVEN MORE

02:36:29.914 --> 02:36:32.984 region:rollup2
COMPLICATED TO.

02:36:31.549 --> 02:36:33.451 region:rollup2
TO MANDATE IT BEING BETTER

02:36:32.984 --> 02:36:35.686 region:rollup2
PEOPLE ARE DOING IT.

02:36:33.451 --> 02:36:36.287 region:rollup2
I AM.

02:36:35.686 --> 02:36:37.588 region:rollup2
JUST KIND OF THE COLLABORATIVE

02:36:36.287 --> 02:36:39.523 region:rollup2
LIFE BUT.

02:36:37.588 --> 02:36:42.360 region:rollup2

I MAY I JUST WANTED TO ADD ONE

02:36:43.628 --> 02:36:48.232 region:rollup2
OTHER AREA WE'VE READ RECENTLY

02:36:46.163 --> 02:36:49.600 region:rollup2
NOTICED THAT. COULD USE SOME

02:36:48.232 --> 02:36:51.035 region:rollup2
MORE EDUCATION AND DIALOGUE

02:36:49.600 --> 02:36:52.536 region:rollup2
NEEDS ARE ARE MORE DISTANT

02:36:51.035 --> 02:36:55.172 region:rollup2
HEALTH CARE PARTNERS.

02:36:52.536 --> 02:36:56.974 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE WE HAD A A BEREAVED

02:36:55.172 --> 02:36:58.509 region:rollup2
FAMILY MEMBER WHO HAD TO PRETTY

02:36:56.974 --> 02:36:59.910 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT EXPERIENCES ONE BEING

02:36:58.509 --> 02:37:01.212 region:rollup2

AND A LOT THIS IS ON THE THEME

02:47:14.291 --> 02:47:15.392 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:47:14.858 --> 02:47:17.928 region:rollup2

MEMBER EGGMAN HAS TALKED ABOUT

02:47:17.928 --> 02:47:22.366 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE ISSUE OF DATA SO WE WE

02:47:20.497 --> 02:47:24.268 region:rollup2
NEED A LOT MORE DATA ABOUT ALL

02:47:22.366 --> 02:47:25.969 region:rollup2
OF THE THE INDIVIDUALS WHO MAKE

02:47:24.268 --> 02:47:27.471 region:rollup2
USE OF THE ACT IN TERMS OF THE

02:47:25.969 --> 02:47:29.106 region:rollup2
IMPACT AND I'LL SAY MORE ABOUT

02:47:27.471 --> 02:47:30.507 region:rollup2
THAT IN A MOMENT. BUT WE ALSO

02:47:29.106 --> 02:47:32.509 region:rollup2
NEED THE SORT OF IN DEPTH

02:47:30.507 --> 02:47:34.111 region:rollup2
NARRATIVE DATA THAT WE GET FROM

02:47:32.509 --> 02:47:35.345 region:rollup2
FROM PATIENTS AND FAMILIES WHO

02:47:34.111 --> 02:47:36.680 region:rollup2
STEP FORWARD AT HEARINGS LIKE

02:47:35.345 --> 02:47:38.048 region:rollup2
THIS.

02:47:36.680 --> 02:47:40.450 region:rollup2
BUT ALSO WE WANTED TO MAKE A

02:47:38.048 --> 02:47:42.619 region:rollup2
LITTLE BROADER BY SYSTEMATICALLY

02:47:40.450 --> 02:47:43.987 region:rollup2
OF REACHING OUT. AND MAKING

02:47:42.619 --> 02:47:46.423 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE PARTICIPATION IN THE

02:47:43.987 --> 02:47:48.592 region:rollup2
STUDY OUR GOAL IN THIS PROJECT

02:47:46.423 --> 02:47:48.892 region:rollup2
IS TO COLLECT TWENTY DETAILED

02:47:48.592 --> 02:47:50.360 region:rollup2
NARRATIVES.

02:47:48.892 --> 02:47:51.895 region:rollup2
.

02:47:50.360 --> 02:47:53.630 region:rollup2
SORRY INCLUDING.

02:47:51.895 --> 02:47:55.399 region:rollup2
.

02:47:53.630 --> 02:47:57.401 region:rollup2
A PATIENT HIM OR HERSELF

02:47:55.399 --> 02:47:59.136 region:rollup2
A FAMILY MEMBER AS WELL AS OF

02:47:57.401 --> 02:48:01.505 region:rollup2
THAT AS WELL AS A CLINICIAN

02:47:59.136 --> 02:48:03.774 region:rollup2
INVOLVED WITH THE SITUATION SO

02:48:01.505 --> 02:48:05.943 region:rollup2
THAT PROJECT IS IN. PROCESS BUT

02:48:03.774 --> 02:48:07.110 region:rollup2
IT WILL BE A RESOURCE I THINK

02:48:05.943 --> 02:48:09.212 region:rollup2
FOR YOUR COMMITTEE AS WE MOVE

02:48:07.110 --> 02:48:10.781 region:rollup2
FORWARD ONCE WE START A DOING

02:48:09.212 --> 02:48:12.516 region:rollup2
THAT DATA ANALYSIS.

02:48:10.781 --> 02:48:14.484 region:rollup2
I WANT TO GIVE YOU ONE EXAMPLE

02:48:12.516 --> 02:48:15.886 region:rollup2
OF THE KIND OF INFORMATION THAT

02:48:14.484 --> 02:48:17.187 region:rollup2
CAN COME FROM THIS KIND OF

02:48:15.886 --> 02:48:18.622 region:rollup2
QUALITATIVE STUDY.

02:48:17.187 --> 02:48:20.257 region:rollup2
WHICH MIGHT NOT COME UP IN

02:48:18.622 --> 02:48:21.525 region:rollup2
ANOTHER WAY.

02:48:20.257 --> 02:48:23.493 region:rollup2
AND SO WE'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT

02:48:21.525 --> 02:48:25.896 region:rollup2
THE ISSUE OF TIMING AND HOW HARD

02:48:23.493 --> 02:48:26.663 region:rollup2
IT IS TO GET THE PROCESS STARTED

02:48:25.896 --> 02:48:29.066 region:rollup2
IT CETERA.

02:48:26.663 --> 02:48:31.335 region:rollup2
AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE

02:48:29.066 --> 02:48:31.935 region:rollup2
DISCOVERED WAS JUST AT A SMALL

02:48:31.335 --> 02:48:33.003 region:rollup2
THING BUT I THINK AN IMPORTANT

02:48:31.935 --> 02:48:35.238 region:rollup2
THING.

02:48:33.003 --> 02:48:37.341 region:rollup2
THERE CAN BE A COMPLETE MISMATCH

02:48:35.238 --> 02:48:39.443 region:rollup2
BETWEEN WHETHER A PATIENT THINKS

02:48:37.341 --> 02:48:40.877 region:rollup2
THAT THEY'VE MADE A REQUEST.

02:48:39.443 --> 02:48:43.080 region:rollup2
ABOUT PHYSICIAN AID IN DYING AS

02:48:40.877 --> 02:48:44.748 region:rollup2
OPPOSED TO WHAT. THE HEALTH CARE

02:48:43.080 --> 02:48:46.450 region:rollup2
SYSTEM HAS HEARD WHAT AN

02:48:44.748 --> 02:48:48.251 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL CLINICIAN HAS HEARD

02:48:46.450 --> 02:48:50.187 region:rollup2
OR WHAT A HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IS

02:48:48.251 --> 02:48:51.655 region:rollup2
PREPARED TO HEAR. BECAUSE ON THE

02:48:50.187 --> 02:48:53.457 region:rollup2
HEALTH CARE SYSTEM PART THIS IS

02:48:51.655 --> 02:48:55.258 region:rollup2
A VERY FORMAL THING IN S. B.

02:48:53.457 --> 02:48:57.160 region:rollup2
MEMORIALIZED UNDOCUMENTED. BUT

02:48:55.258 --> 02:48:58.729 region:rollup2
THE PATIENT SOMETIMES GET OUT OF

02:48:57.160 --> 02:49:00.797 region:rollup2
WHACK IN TERMS OF THE TIMING

02:48:58.729 --> 02:49:03.233 region:rollup2
BECAUSE. THEY WILL SAY WELL BUT

02:49:00.797 --> 02:49:05.268 region:rollup2
I I RAISE THAT TWO MONTHS AGO

02:49:03.233 --> 02:49:06.703 region:rollup2
WITH MY ONCOLOGIST I YOU KNOW I

02:49:05.268 --> 02:49:08.071 region:rollup2
SAID THAT I WANTED TO DO THIS.

02:49:06.703 --> 02:49:09.906 region:rollup2
WHY ARE YOU NOT HEARING ME ARE

02:49:08.071 --> 02:49:11.174 region:rollup2
LISTENING TO ME SO THAT JUST ONE

02:49:09.906 --> 02:49:13.076 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE I WANT TO?

02:49:11.174 --> 02:49:14.778 region:rollup2
?

02:49:13.076 --> 02:49:16.313 region:rollup2
BUT.

02:49:14.778 --> 02:49:17.981 region:rollup2
I THINK I'M NOT IN THE INTEREST

02:49:16.313 --> 02:49:19.883 region:rollup2
OF TIME I THINK I WAS GOING TO

02:49:17.981 --> 02:49:22.085 region:rollup2

DOING THIS WHICH ARE VERY.

02:49:23.587 --> 02:49:27.190 region:rollup2
INTERESTING PERHAPS I COULD JUST

02:49:25.155 --> 02:49:27.991 region:rollup2
SUMMARIZE BY SAYING YOU KNOW WE

02:49:27.190 --> 02:49:30.093 region:rollup2
WORRY.

02:49:27.991 --> 02:49:32.129 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE FUNCTIONS OF MY TEAM

02:49:30.093 --> 02:49:33.430 region:rollup2
IN PARTICULAR MY GROUP HAS BEEN

02:49:32.129 --> 02:49:35.666 region:rollup2
TO GET PEOPLE WHO'VE BEEN

02:49:33.430 --> 02:49:38.335 region:rollup2
HISTORICALLY OPPOSED TO THESE

02:49:35.666 --> 02:49:39.336 region:rollup2
PRACTICES TO WORK TOGETHER WITH

02:49:38.335 --> 02:49:40.737 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS HAVE BEEN PROP

02:49:39.336 --> 02:49:42.873 region:rollup2
PROPONENTS.

02:49:40.737 --> 02:49:44.741 region:rollup2
AT THIS PARTICULAR MOMENT WHEN

02:49:42.873 --> 02:49:46.276 region:rollup2
IT'S NOW THE LAW AND IT'S SO

02:49:44.741 --> 02:49:48.078 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT TO GET THIS RIGHT IN

02:49:46.276 --> 02:49:50.480 region:rollup2
TERMS OF AND OF LIFE CARE.

02:49:48.078 --> 02:49:52.582 region:rollup2
ALTOGETHER IN CALIFORNIA.

02:49:52.582 --> 02:49:56.820 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:49:54.751 --> 02:49:58.155 region:rollup2
WE. ARE I WOULD ARGUE AND I

02:49:56.820 --> 02:50:00.357 region:rollup2
THINK MOST PEOPLE WOULD ARGUE

02:49:58.155 --> 02:50:02.259 region:rollup2
YOU WE DON'T WANT THIS TO BE

02:50:00.357 --> 02:50:03.560 region:rollup2
PRACTICE FOR THE WRONG REASONS

02:50:02.259 --> 02:50:06.196 region:rollup2
MEANING LACK OF ACCESS TO PAY

02:50:03.560 --> 02:50:08.231 region:rollup2
THAT YOU CARE. UP OF OF HOPELESS

02:50:06.196 --> 02:50:09.599 region:rollup2
LIKE AND POVERTY IT CETERA. I'M

02:50:08.231 --> 02:50:11.201 region:rollup2
SO THE REASONS ARE VERY VERY

02:50:09.599 --> 02:50:12.469 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT AND WHAT WE'RE HEARING

02:50:11.201 --> 02:50:13.870 region:rollup2
IS AND I JUST WANT TO SUMMARIZE

02:50:12.469 --> 02:50:15.505 region:rollup2
ONE ONE.

02:50:13.870 --> 02:50:17.441 region:rollup2
PATIENT ACTUALLY SAID TO US.

02:50:15.505 --> 02:50:19.009 region:rollup2
ALL I WANT IS TO BE FREE OF THIS

02:50:17.441 --> 02:50:21.044 region:rollup2
BODY.

02:50:19.009 --> 02:50:22.579 region:rollup2
THEY WERE JUST LITERALLY AT THE

02:50:21.044 --> 02:50:24.981 region:rollup2
END AND THAT WAS ALL THEY COULD.

02:50:22.579 --> 02:50:25.582 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THAT THAT WAS THAT

02:50:24.981 --> 02:50:28.618 region:rollup2
WAS WHERE THEY WERE.

02:50:25.582 --> 02:50:29.786 region:rollup2
.

02:50:28.618 --> 02:50:30.387 region:rollup2
SO I ALSO WANT TO.

02:50:29.786 --> 02:50:37.260 region:rollup2
I SHOULD ALSO POINT OUT IT IS

02:50:30.387 --> 02:50:38.528 region:rollup2
HERE.

02:50:37.260 --> 02:50:39.162 region:rollup2
REALLY INVOLVED

02:50:38.528 --> 02:50:41.198 region:rollup2
PATIENTS AND FAMILIES WHO HAVE

02:50:39.162 --> 02:50:44.568 region:rollup2
CHOSEN TO MAKE USE OF SOME OF

02:50:41.198 --> 02:50:46.069 region:rollup2
THE SPECIALTY PRACTICES ON THAT.

02:50:44.568 --> 02:50:47.871 region:rollup2
ARE AT THAT HAVE DEVELOPED IN

02:50:46.069 --> 02:50:50.941 region:rollup2
THE STATE TO IMPLEMENT THE THE

02:50:47.871 --> 02:50:53.143 region:rollup2
LAW. AND SO WE ALSO HAVE SOME OF

02:50:50.941 --> 02:50:54.878 region:rollup2
THAT INFORMATION AND WE CAN. WE.

02:50:53.143 --> 02:50:56.213 region:rollup2
WILL WE'RE FOLLOWING THE STORIES

02:50:54.878 --> 02:50:58.348 region:rollup2
OF WHAT ARE THE BARRIERS IN

02:50:56.213 --> 02:50:59.583 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS

02:50:58.348 --> 02:51:02.652 region:rollup2
WHETHER THE ENABLERS.

02:50:59.583 --> 02:51:04.354 region:rollup2
WHY DO PEOPLE CHOOSE TO GO OUT

02:51:02.652 --> 02:51:05.856 region:rollup2
OF THEIR OWN HEALTH CARE SYSTEM

02:51:04.354 --> 02:51:07.390 region:rollup2
AND TO GO ELSEWHERE? AND ALL

02:51:05.856 --> 02:51:07.824 region:rollup2
THOSE THINGS I THINK ARE GOING

02:51:07.390 --> 02:51:09.493 region:rollup2
TO BE VERY HELPFUL.

02:51:07.824 --> 02:51:11.428 region:rollup2
.

02:51:09.493 --> 02:51:12.462 region:rollup2
AND FINALLY I'LL SAY THAT

02:51:11.428 --> 02:51:14.965 region:rollup2
ACROSS THE STATE.

02:51:12.462 --> 02:51:16.299 region:rollup2
.

02:51:14.965 --> 02:51:17.767 region:rollup2
WE DID CONVENE A MEETING WE

02:51:16.299 --> 02:51:19.669 region:rollup2

02:51:17.767 --> 02:51:21.705 region:rollup2
FOR PLANNING WHICH ASSEMBLY MEN

02:51:19.669 --> 02:51:23.573 region:rollup2
ACT EGGMAN DID ATTEND. AND THEN

02:51:21.705 --> 02:51:24.841 region:rollup2
IN SEPTEMBER WE GOT A HUNDRED

02:51:23.573 --> 02:51:26.810 region:rollup2
AND TEN INDIVIDUALS FROM AROUND

02:51:24.841 --> 02:51:29.646 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA TOGETHER. OUGHT TO

02:51:26.810 --> 02:51:33.350 region:rollup2
THINK ABOUT POLICY AND OUR GROUP

02:51:29.646 --> 02:51:33.350 region:rollup2
AT UCSF WILL BE ALL THAT IS

02:51:33.416 --> 02:51:36.920 region:rollup2

AND BEST PRACTICES THAT WE HAVE.

02:51:39.356 --> 02:51:42.692 region:rollup2
COLLECTED FROM AROUND THE STATE

02:51:41.057 --> 02:51:44.327 region:rollup2
THAT WILL ALL BE MADE AVAILABLE

02:51:42.692 --> 02:51:46.730 region:rollup2
ON A WEBSITE AT THE CALIFORNIA

02:51:44.327 --> 02:51:47.998 region:rollup2
COALITION AND ALSO AT UCSF SO

02:51:46.730 --> 02:51:49.299 region:rollup2
HOPEFULLY THAT WILL BE AND.

02:51:47.998 --> 02:51:50.901 region:rollup2
AN OPPORTUNITY AS YOU MOVE

02:51:49.299 --> 02:51:53.537 region:rollup2
FORWARD.

02:51:50.901 --> 02:51:54.938 region:rollup2
I THINK IN ON THE DATA ISSUE I

02:51:53.537 --> 02:51:56.473 region:rollup2
WANT TO EMPHASIZE ONE ISSUE THAT

02:51:54.938 --> 02:51:58.141 region:rollup2
I THINK IS VERY SPECIFIC AND

02:51:56.473 --> 02:52:01.011 region:rollup2
VERY IMPORTANT. AND THAT IS THAT

02:51:58.141 --> 02:52:03.346 region:rollup2
WE DON'T HAVE GOOD DATA ABOUT

02:52:01.011 --> 02:52:04.781 region:rollup2
THE RANGE OF DIVERSITY. UP OF

02:52:03.346 --> 02:52:07.117 region:rollup2
THE INDIVIDUALS WHO MAKE USE OF

02:52:04.781 --> 02:52:09.219 region:rollup2
THE ACT AND THAT'S PARTLY I

02:52:07.117 --> 02:52:10.754 region:rollup2
THINK BECAUSE OF A AND THAT OF A

02:52:09.219 --> 02:52:13.490 region:rollup2
PROBLEM IN THE WAY THAT THAT

02:52:10.754 --> 02:52:15.025 region:rollup2
DATA IS BEING IT IS IS BEING

02:52:13.490 --> 02:52:16.159 region:rollup2
OBTAINED AT THIS PUNK MOMENT.

02:52:15.025 --> 02:52:16.593 region:rollup2
AND IT'S BEING OBTAINED BY

02:52:16.159 --> 02:52:17.160 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT THE DEATH

02:52:16.593 --> 02:52:18.962 region:rollup2
CERTIFICATE.

02:52:17.160 --> 02:52:20.730 region:rollup2
AND

02:52:18.962 --> 02:52:22.232 region:rollup2
I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT THAT

02:52:20.730 --> 02:52:24.868 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT A DEATH CERTIFICATE

02:52:22.232 --> 02:52:26.069 region:rollup2
IS NOT A GOOD WAY TO ASCERTAIN

02:52:24.868 --> 02:52:26.636 region:rollup2
SOMEONE SELF IDENTITY YOUR

02:52:26.069 --> 02:52:28.271 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING OF THEIR OWN.

02:52:26.636 --> 02:52:31.074 region:rollup2
.

02:52:28.271 --> 02:52:33.176 region:rollup2
ETHNICITY EXPERIENCE IT CETERA.

02:52:31.074 --> 02:52:35.512 region:rollup2
THIS SO I THINK THAT'S

02:52:33.176 --> 02:52:37.581 region:rollup2
A VERY SPECIFIC MODIFICATION

02:52:35.512 --> 02:52:39.015 region:rollup2
THAT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AND

02:52:37.581 --> 02:52:40.217 region:rollup2

02:55:18.241 --> 02:55:22.379 region:rollup2
I THINK EVERYONE AGREES THAT

02:55:20.210 --> 02:55:24.814 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW WE ARE IN THE RAMP UP

02:55:22.379 --> 02:55:28.151 region:rollup2
PERIOD OF IMPLEMENTATION.

02:55:24.814 --> 02:55:29.619 region:rollup2
AND THAT EACH YEAR. ACCESS TO

02:55:28.151 --> 02:55:31.688 region:rollup2
THE LAW WILL GET BETTER AND

02:55:29.619 --> 02:55:33.690 region:rollup2
BETTER AS HEALTH CARE CONSUMERS

02:55:31.688 --> 02:55:36.025 region:rollup2
BECOME EMPOWERED. AROUND THE

02:55:33.690 --> 02:55:39.129 region:rollup2
LONG AND AROUND HEALTH CARE AS

02:55:36.025 --> 02:55:41.097 region:rollup2
HEALTH SYSTEMS SEEK TO IMPROVE.

02:55:39.129 --> 02:55:43.299 region:rollup2
THEIR SYSTEMS BOMB AND AS

02:55:41.097 --> 02:55:44.868 region:rollup2
DOCTORS BECOME EDUCATED AND MORE

02:55:43.299 --> 02:55:46.803 region:rollup2
COMFORTABLE WITH THE LAW.

02:55:44.868 --> 02:55:48.405 region:rollup2
IN FACT THE NUMBER ONE THING

02:55:46.803 --> 02:55:50.140 region:rollup2
THAT WE'VE HEARD FROM PATIENT

02:55:48.405 --> 02:55:51.608 region:rollup2
AND DOCTOR EXPERIENCE.

02:55:50.140 --> 02:55:53.009 region:rollup2
IS THAT THERE ARE SOME DOCTORS

02:55:51.608 --> 02:55:54.544 region:rollup2
WHO FEEL STRONGLY ABOUT THIS.

02:55:53.009 --> 02:55:57.680 region:rollup2
THEY KNOW RIGHT AWAY HOW THEY

02:55:54.544 --> 02:55:59.015 region:rollup2
FEEL BUT THE MOST DOCTORS.

02:55:57.680 --> 02:56:00.183 region:rollup2
DON'T KNOW HOW THEY FEEL THEY

02:55:59.015 --> 02:56:02.986 region:rollup2
HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT IT UNTIL

02:56:00.183 --> 02:56:04.687 region:rollup2
THEIR FIRST PATIENT ASKS.

02:56:02.986 --> 02:56:06.222 region:rollup2
AND THEN IT BECOMES A REAL TO

02:56:04.687 --> 02:56:08.224 region:rollup2
THEM AND THEY HAVE THAT

02:56:06.222 --> 02:56:09.959 region:rollup2
CONNECTION WITH THAT THE SACRED

02:56:08.224 --> 02:56:11.995 region:rollup2
PATIENT DOCTOR RELATIONSHIP.

02:56:09.959 --> 02:56:13.663 region:rollup2
BECOMES REAL TO THEM AND THEN

02:56:11.995 --> 02:56:15.231 region:rollup2
THEY DECIDE YES I'M GONNA HELP

02:56:13.663 --> 02:56:16.599 region:rollup2
MY PATIENT BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT

02:56:15.231 --> 02:56:19.202 region:rollup2
MY PATIENT WANTS THIS IS PATIENT

02:56:16.599 --> 02:56:22.505 region:rollup2
DIRECTED CARE.

02:56:19.202 --> 02:56:24.674 region:rollup2
SO EVERY YEAR IS GOING TO GET

02:56:22.505 --> 02:56:28.211 region:rollup2
BETTER AND BETTER PHAM SAID LIKE

02:56:24.674 --> 02:56:29.312 region:rollup2
TO SHARE FOUR MAIN TAKEAWAYS.

02:56:28.211 --> 02:56:31.281 region:rollup2
FIRST THE LAWS WORKING AS

02:56:29.312 --> 02:56:33.416 region:rollup2
INTENDED.

02:56:31.281 --> 02:56:34.617 region:rollup2
OFF FROM OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH

02:56:33.416 --> 02:56:35.885 region:rollup2
PATIENTS AND DOCTORS AND

02:56:34.617 --> 02:56:38.354 region:rollup2
HOSPICES WE BELIEVE

02:56:35.885 --> 02:56:39.656 region:rollup2
APPROXIMATELY FIVE HUNDRED.

02:56:38.354 --> 02:56:41.991 region:rollup2
TERMINALLY ILL PEOPLE HAVE

02:56:39.656 --> 02:56:42.559 region:rollup2
RECEIVED PRESCRIPTIONS.

02:56:41.991 --> 02:56:44.527 region:rollup2
IN CALIFORNIA AND THE FIRST

02:56:42.559 --> 02:56:47.130 region:rollup2
YEAR.

02:56:44.527 --> 02:56:48.898 region:rollup2
UP THE NUMBER ONE FRUSTRATION

02:56:47.130 --> 02:56:50.700 region:rollup2
THAT WE HEAR FROM PATIENTS OF

02:56:48.898 --> 02:56:53.036 region:rollup2
FAMILY MEMBERS IS THE PROCESS IS

02:56:50.700 --> 02:56:54.170 region:rollup2
TOO BURDENSOME.

02:56:53.036 --> 02:56:55.338 region:rollup2
THE PAPER THERE'S TOO MUCH

02:56:54.170 --> 02:56:57.574 region:rollup2
PAPERWORK.

02:56:55.338 --> 02:56:59.642 region:rollup2
THERE'S JUST THE WAITING PERIOD

02:56:57.574 --> 02:57:01.778 region:rollup2
IS TOO LONG IT JUST TAKES TOO

02:56:59.642 --> 02:57:02.045 region:rollup2
LONG IT'S TOO MANY HOOPS TO JUMP

02:57:01.778 --> 02:57:04.747 region:rollup2
THROUGH.

02:57:02.045 --> 02:57:06.349 region:rollup2
THESE PATIENTS.

02:57:04.747 --> 02:57:07.817 region:rollup2
THEY'RE DYING THEY DON'T HAVE A

02:57:06.349 --> 02:57:09.686 region:rollup2
LOT OF TIME THEY DON'T WANT TO

02:57:07.817 --> 02:57:11.421 region:rollup2
SPEND SPEND THEIR PRECIOUS.

02:57:09.686 --> 02:57:12.422 region:rollup2
TIME TRYING TO.

02:57:11.421 --> 02:57:13.790 region:rollup2
JUMP THROUGH ALL THESE HOOPS

02:57:12.422 --> 02:57:16.459 region:rollup2
THEY WANT TO SPEND IT WITH OUR

02:57:13.790 --> 02:57:18.361 region:rollup2
FAMILIES AND SO I I JUST URGE

02:57:16.459 --> 02:57:19.462 region:rollup2
YOU TO KEEP THAT IN MIND.

02:57:18.361 --> 02:57:21.364 region:rollup2
AS WE GO FORWARD AND WE IMPROVE

02:57:19.462 --> 02:57:23.166 region:rollup2
OUR PROCESSES.

02:57:21.364 --> 02:57:24.901 region:rollup2
SECONDS

02:57:23.166 --> 02:57:27.170 region:rollup2
PATIENTS ARE REPORTING FEELING

02:57:24.901 --> 02:57:28.938 region:rollup2
VERY EMPOWERED AROUND THE LAW.

02:57:27.170 --> 02:57:30.206 region:rollup2
THEY'RE HAVING IN DEPTH

02:57:28.938 --> 02:57:31.875 region:rollup2
CONVERSATIONS WE'VE HEARD THIS

02:57:30.206 --> 02:57:33.676 region:rollup2
OVER AND OVER AGAIN IS IT IS THE

02:57:31.875 --> 02:57:35.678 region:rollup2
THEME. THEY ARE HAVE IT'S THE

02:57:33.676 --> 02:57:37.113 region:rollup2
EXCUSE FOR THEM TO FINALLY TALK

02:57:35.678 --> 02:57:38.281 region:rollup2
TO THEIR DOCTORS ABOUT WHAT THEY

02:57:37.113 --> 02:57:39.816 region:rollup2
REALLY WANT AND DOCTORS

02:57:38.281 --> 02:57:41.150 region:rollup2
REPORTING THE SAME THING.

02:57:39.816 --> 02:57:42.085 region:rollup2
IT'S REALLY TRANSFORMING THE

02:57:41.150 --> 02:57:44.387 region:rollup2
END OF LIFE EXPERIENCE.

02:57:42.085 --> 02:57:46.489 region:rollup2
FOR PATIENTS.

02:57:44.387 --> 02:57:48.324 region:rollup2
A THIRD BY OUR COUNT.

02:57:46.489 --> 02:57:50.527 region:rollup2
EIGHTY FOUR.

02:57:48.324 --> 02:57:51.961 region:rollup2
EIGHTY FOUR PERCENT OF SECULAR

02:57:50.527 --> 02:57:53.830 region:rollup2
HEALTH SYSTEMS IN CALIFORNIA NOW

02:57:51.961 --> 02:57:55.064 region:rollup2
HAVE POLICY SUPPORT OF A PATIENT

02:57:53.830 --> 02:57:56.799 region:rollup2
AND OF LIFE CARE THAT'S

02:57:55.064 --> 02:57:59.002 region:rollup2
PHENOMENAL. IT TOOK OREGON

02:57:56.799 --> 02:57:59.569 region:rollup2
TWENTY YEARS TO GET TO WHERE

02:57:59.002 --> 02:58:01.471 region:rollup2
CRAP CALIFORNIA MADE IN ONE

02:57:59.569 --> 02:58:04.574 region:rollup2
YEAR.

02:58:01.471 --> 02:58:05.808 region:rollup2
SO THAT TRANSLATES TO OVER FIVE

02:58:04.574 --> 02:58:06.776 region:rollup2
HUNDRED HEALTH CARE FACILITIES

02:58:05.808 --> 02:58:08.244 region:rollup2
AND OVER A HUNDRED HOSPICE

02:58:06.776 --> 02:58:10.980 region:rollup2
LOCATIONS.

02:58:08.244 --> 02:58:12.749 region:rollup2
ON THE GROUND ACROSS THE STATE.

02:58:10.980 --> 02:58:14.250 region:rollup2
I'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT THAT

02:58:12.749 --> 02:58:15.818 region:rollup2
SEVERAL HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS OF

02:58:14.250 --> 02:58:16.853 region:rollup2
NOT ONLY ADOPTED SUPPORT OF

02:58:15.818 --> 02:58:18.288 region:rollup2
POLICIES BUT THEY HAVE

02:58:16.853 --> 02:58:19.956 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTED THE INTERNAL

02:58:18.288 --> 02:58:21.891 region:rollup2
REFERRAL IMPATIENT NAVIGATOR

02:58:19.956 --> 02:58:24.761 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS THAT YOU HEARD KAISER

02:58:21.891 --> 02:58:26.596 region:rollup2
AND UC DAVIS TALK ABOUT TODAY.

02:58:24.761 --> 02:58:28.531 region:rollup2
THAT IS THE GOLD STANDARD.

02:58:26.596 --> 02:58:30.600 region:rollup2
WE WERE REALLY URGE ALL HELL

02:58:28.531 --> 02:58:32.902 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS TO GO TOWARDS THAT

02:58:30.600 --> 02:58:35.305 region:rollup2
SYSTEM IT IT GUY IT.

02:58:32.902 --> 02:58:37.407 region:rollup2
IT JUST INCREASES THE PATIENT

02:58:35.305 --> 02:58:39.509 region:rollup2
SATISFACTION X. M. EXPERIENCE

02:58:37.407 --> 02:58:41.077 region:rollup2
AND WE HAVE FOUND THAT IT ALSO

02:58:39.509 --> 02:58:42.679 region:rollup2
HELPS GREATLY WITH HEALTHCARE

02:58:41.077 --> 02:58:44.147 region:rollup2
DISPARITY.

02:58:42.679 --> 02:58:46.149 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE MORE SUPPORTIVE A

02:58:44.147 --> 02:58:48.117 region:rollup2
SYSTEM IS OF THE MORE THAT

02:58:46.149 --> 02:58:49.886 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WHO. ARE HISTORICALLY

02:58:48.117 --> 02:58:52.021 region:rollup2
HAVE NOT GOTTEN GOOD HEALTH CARE

02:58:49.886 --> 02:58:53.890 region:rollup2
WILL GET ACCESS TO THIS LAW.

02:58:52.021 --> 02:58:56.292 region:rollup2
I FOURTH.

02:58:53.890 --> 02:58:58.595 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATELY SOME HOSPITALS AND

02:58:56.292 --> 02:58:59.562 region:rollup2
HOSPICES ARE STILL PROHIBITING

02:58:58.595 --> 02:59:01.764 region:rollup2
THEIR DOCTORS FROM PRESCRIBING

02:58:59.562 --> 02:59:04.400 region:rollup2
UNDER THE LAW.

02:59:01.764 --> 02:59:06.936 region:rollup2
AND I'VE GOT GOOD NEWS THOUGH.

02:59:04.400 --> 02:59:09.005 region:rollup2

SYSTEMS THAT HAVE THESE SUPPORT

02:59:12.442 --> 02:59:17.380 region:rollup2
OF POLICIES.

02:59:14.143 --> 02:59:18.648 region:rollup2
WE HAVE CREATED AN ONLINE FIND

03:01:21.371 --> 03:01:26.275 region:rollup2
AND SO I I THOUGHT I'D DROP IN

03:01:23.973 --> 03:01:27.944 region:rollup2
JUST LIKE A FEW LITTLE TIDBITS

03:01:26.275 --> 03:01:30.012 region:rollup2
AT SOMEONE AND GROWING UP BUT

03:01:27.944 --> 03:01:31.981 region:rollup2
SHE WAS. YOU KNOW SHE SHE FIRST

03:01:30.012 --> 03:01:34.584 region:rollup2
THOUGHT USE UNDENIABLY CHAIRMAN.

03:01:31.981 --> 03:01:37.019 region:rollup2
SHE DID NOT.

03:01:34.584 --> 03:01:39.021 region:rollup2
CARE TO DRIVE ON THE FREEWAY.

03:01:37.019 --> 03:01:40.990 region:rollup2
SHE WAS A TEACHER PRESCHOOL

03:01:39.021 --> 03:01:43.926 region:rollup2
KINDERGARTEN TEACHER AND STARTED

03:01:40.990 --> 03:01:47.130 region:rollup2
DOWN BUSINESS. AND NEVER TALKED.

03:01:43.926 --> 03:01:48.731 region:rollup2
TO HER STUDENTS AND SO THEY HAD

03:01:47.130 --> 03:01:49.232 region:rollup2
TO ORDER AND LOOKED UP TO HER

03:01:48.731 --> 03:01:52.201 region:rollup2
FOR THAT.

03:01:49.232 --> 03:01:55.071 region:rollup2
SHE CHEATED AT SPADES.

03:01:52.201 --> 03:01:55.872 region:rollup2
SHE WAS NOT A DRINKER BUT YOU

03:01:55.071 --> 03:01:56.839 region:rollup2
CAN POLISH OFF A BOTTLE OF GOOD

03:01:55.872 --> 03:01:58.875 region:rollup2
SHOPS.

03:01:56.839 --> 03:02:01.144 region:rollup2
.

03:01:58.875 --> 03:02:02.412 region:rollup2
AND SHE SHE COULD BE LATE TO

03:02:01.144 --> 03:02:03.913 region:rollup2
THINGS BUT SHE WAS ALWAYS AHEAD

03:02:02.412 --> 03:02:06.149 region:rollup2
OF HER TIME.

03:02:03.913 --> 03:02:08.684 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT WAS THE CASE

03:02:06.149 --> 03:02:10.920 region:rollup2
HERE SHE WAS I HAD EVER TIME AND

03:02:08.684 --> 03:02:12.522 region:rollup2
THIS AND SOCIETY SIMPLY HADN'T

03:02:10.920 --> 03:02:15.358 region:rollup2
CAUGHT UP TO WHERE SHE WAS.

03:02:12.522 --> 03:02:17.126 region:rollup2
WHEN SHE GOT.

03:02:15.358 --> 03:02:18.961 region:rollup2
HER DIAGNOSIS IN NINETEEN NINETY

03:02:17.126 --> 03:02:21.597 region:rollup2
FOUR IS A REALLY SCARY I SHE'S

03:02:18.961 --> 03:02:23.299 region:rollup2
DIAGNOSED WITH MULTIPLE MYELOMA

03:02:21.597 --> 03:02:26.002 region:rollup2
WE HAD NEVER HEARD OF IT BEFORE.

03:02:23.299 --> 03:02:27.503 region:rollup2
I DID WHAT ANY TEAM LOVING

03:02:26.002 --> 03:02:28.738 region:rollup2
TEENAGE SON WOULD DO WHICH IS I

03:02:27.503 --> 03:02:30.506 region:rollup2
LOOKED AT WHICH CELEBRITIES HAD

03:02:28.738 --> 03:02:32.475 region:rollup2
THIS DISEASE BECAUSE THAT TELLS

03:02:30.506 --> 03:02:34.644 region:rollup2
YOU. YOU KNOW IF IT WHETHER IT'S

03:02:32.475 --> 03:02:35.645 region:rollup2
LIKE WRITTEN TRULY PENETRATED.

03:02:34.644 --> 03:02:38.214 region:rollup2
SOCIETY.

03:02:35.645 --> 03:02:41.150 region:rollup2
THE ONLY ONE I COULD FIND WAS

03:02:38.214 --> 03:02:41.484 region:rollup2
ROY SCHEIDER SO THAT TO ME WAS A

03:02:41.150 --> 03:02:42.084 region:rollup2
RARE DISEASE.

03:02:41.484 --> 03:02:44.153 region:rollup2
.

03:02:42.084 --> 03:02:46.289 region:rollup2
AND SHE OVER THE NEXT TWENTY TWO

03:02:44.153 --> 03:02:48.624 region:rollup2
YEARS THAT THE PROGNOSIS WAS NOT

03:02:46.289 --> 03:02:50.860 region:rollup2
GREAT THEY TOLD HER SHE HAD.

03:02:48.624 --> 03:02:51.227 region:rollup2
IF SHE WAS LUCKY FEW YEARS FIVE

03:02:50.860 --> 03:02:52.361 region:rollup2
YEARS.

03:02:51.227 --> 03:02:54.997 region:rollup2
AND THEY.

03:02:52.361 --> 03:02:57.433 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDED THAT SHE STARRED

03:02:54.997 --> 03:02:58.201 region:rollup2
AGGRESSIVE CHEMOTHERAPY THAT WAS

03:02:57.433 --> 03:03:00.203 region:rollup2
NOT HAPPENING THAT WITHOUT MY

03:02:58.201 --> 03:03:02.805 region:rollup2
MOM. SO OVER THE NEXT TWENTY TWO

03:03:00.203 --> 03:03:06.409 region:rollup2
YEARS SHE BATTLED IT HER WAY.

03:03:02.805 --> 03:03:08.344 region:rollup2
THROUGH A STRICT REGIMEN OF.

03:03:06.409 --> 03:03:10.379 region:rollup2
HOLISTIC REMEDIES AND NATURAL

03:03:08.344 --> 03:03:12.014 region:rollup2
DIETS THAT HER HER FAMILY WASN'T

03:03:10.379 --> 03:03:13.683 region:rollup2
ALWAYS ON BOARD WITH BUT I MEAN

03:03:12.014 --> 03:03:14.283 region:rollup2
SHE DID IT HER WAY.

03:03:13.683 --> 03:03:16.185 region:rollup2
AND.

03:03:14.283 --> 03:03:18.788 region:rollup2
FOR HER IT WAS MORE IMPORTANT

03:03:16.185 --> 03:03:19.922 region:rollup2
TO LIVE AS HERSELF

03:03:18.788 --> 03:03:21.324 region:rollup2
THEN MERELY SURVIVE AT SOMEONE

03:03:19.922 --> 03:03:24.093 region:rollup2
ELSE

03:03:21.324 --> 03:03:26.462 region:rollup2
AND THAT THAT EXTENDED TO.

03:03:24.093 --> 03:03:27.930 region:rollup2
HOW SHE SAW AND WANTED TO

03:03:26.462 --> 03:03:31.300 region:rollup2
CONFRONT HER OWN DEATH AS WELL?

03:03:27.930 --> 03:03:33.870 region:rollup2
AND SO YEARS BEFORE ON.

03:03:31.300 --> 03:03:36.072 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIANS AND OF LIFE ACT TOM

03:03:33.870 --> 03:03:37.907 region:rollup2
CAME INTO PLAY SHE WAS TALKING

03:03:36.072 --> 03:03:40.443 region:rollup2
ABOUT HER DESIRE TO WHEN THE

03:03:37.907 --> 03:03:43.446 region:rollup2
TIME CAME.

03:03:40.443 --> 03:03:45.147 region:rollup2
TAKE AGENCY OVER THE LAST THING

03:03:43.446 --> 03:03:46.449 region:rollup2
SHE WOULD EVER DO IN THIS WORLD.

03:03:45.147 --> 03:03:47.750 region:rollup2
AND SO SHE LOOKED AT THE OTHER

03:03:46.449 --> 03:03:49.619 region:rollup2
STATES WHERE.

03:03:47.750 --> 03:03:51.921 region:rollup2
THAT HAD ADOPTED DEATH WITH

03:03:49.619 --> 03:03:53.256 region:rollup2
DIGNITY ACTS DIFFERENT COUNTRIES

03:03:51.921 --> 03:03:56.325 region:rollup2
SHE THOUGHT ABOUT.

03:03:53.256 --> 03:03:58.060 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW MOVING TO IT TO SOME

03:03:56.325 --> 03:03:59.562 region:rollup2
OF THE STATES OR COUNTRIES BUT

03:03:58.060 --> 03:04:00.997 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA WAS OUR HOME AND YOU

03:03:59.562 --> 03:04:02.798 region:rollup2
DON'T WANT TO LOOK LEVER HOME.

03:04:00.997 --> 03:04:04.834 region:rollup2
SO WHEN THIS LAW WAS PASSED IT

03:04:02.798 --> 03:04:06.969 region:rollup2
WAS A GREAT RELIEF TO HER

03:04:04.834 --> 03:04:10.606 region:rollup2
AND WHEN SHE.

03:04:06.969 --> 03:04:12.241 region:rollup2
ON MY DAD MYSELF AND SHE MET

03:04:10.606 --> 03:04:13.409 region:rollup2
WITH THE ONCOLOGIST AND GOT THE

03:04:12.241 --> 03:04:15.044 region:rollup2
NEWS THAT SHE HAD MONTHS LEFT TO

03:04:13.409 --> 03:04:16.679 region:rollup2
LIVE.

03:04:15.044 --> 03:04:18.447 region:rollup2
BUT THE FIRST QUESTION SHE ASKED

03:04:16.679 --> 03:04:19.181 region:rollup2
WAS ABOUT OKAY HOW DO I DO THE

03:04:18.447 --> 03:04:20.850 region:rollup2
SAME TIME THING.

03:04:19.181 --> 03:04:22.752 region:rollup2
.

03:04:20.850 --> 03:04:24.020 region:rollup2
AND LIKE AND.

03:04:22.752 --> 03:04:25.555 region:rollup2
I THINK A LOT OF THE STUMBLES

03:04:24.020 --> 03:04:27.156 region:rollup2
THAT HAPPENED OUR PART OF THE

03:04:25.555 --> 03:04:27.390 region:rollup2
RAMP UP THAT WERE DESCRIBED.

03:04:27.156 --> 03:04:29.358 region:rollup2
OTHERS.

03:04:27.390 --> 03:04:30.993 region:rollup2
.

03:04:29.358 --> 03:04:33.029 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THERE WAS TROUBLE JUST

03:04:30.993 --> 03:04:34.196 region:rollup2
GETTING BASIC PAPERWORK YOU KNOW

03:04:33.029 --> 03:04:36.032 region:rollup2
LIKE WE WERE TOLD IT HAD BEEN

03:04:34.196 --> 03:04:38.701 region:rollup2
MAILED TO OUR HOUSE. EVEN THOUGH

03:04:36.032 --> 03:04:40.770 region:rollup2
THERE IS A WHEN YOU COULD ACCESS

03:04:38.701 --> 03:04:43.205 region:rollup2
ONLINE OF THEM YOU KNOW IT IT

03:04:40.770 --> 03:04:44.140 region:rollup2
FELT LIKE DIFFERENT ASSISTANCE

03:04:43.205 --> 03:04:45.942 region:rollup2
THEN MAIL IT TO SOMEONE HAD TO

03:04:44.140 --> 03:04:46.375 region:rollup2
DRIVE IT OUT TO US THINGS LIKE

03:04:45.942 --> 03:04:48.511 region:rollup2
THAT AND THAT WERE.

03:04:46.375 --> 03:04:50.680 region:rollup2
.

03:04:48.511 --> 03:04:52.548 region:rollup2
BUT AVOIDABLE BUT.

03:04:50.680 --> 03:04:55.484 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT.

03:04:52.548 --> 03:04:55.818 region:rollup2
MORTAL SINS IN THE LAW OUR

03:04:55.484 --> 03:04:58.187 region:rollup2
MORTAL FLAWS.

03:04:55.818 --> 03:04:59.889 region:rollup2
.

03:04:58.187 --> 03:05:01.724 region:rollup2
SO BUT THERE WERE OTHER ISSUES

03:04:59.889 --> 03:05:03.092 region:rollup2
LIKE THE HOSPICE CARE PROVIDER

03:05:01.724 --> 03:05:04.427 region:rollup2
AND THE HEALTH CARE PROVIDER

03:05:03.092 --> 03:05:06.095 region:rollup2
INITIALLY CAN DECIDE WHOSE

03:05:04.427 --> 03:05:06.929 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITY IT WAS TO TAKE IT

03:05:06.095 --> 03:05:08.731 region:rollup2
TO THE NEXT PHASE.

03:05:06.929 --> 03:05:11.667 region:rollup2
.

03:05:08.731 --> 03:05:13.603 region:rollup2
THEN FINDING EVEN HER ONCOLOGIST

03:05:11.667 --> 03:05:15.438 region:rollup2
WAS ON BOARD TO DO THE ONE OF

03:05:13.603 --> 03:05:17.039 region:rollup2
THAT NECESSARY CONSULTATIONS BUT

03:05:15.438 --> 03:05:19.675 region:rollup2
FINDING THAT OTHER DOCTOR.

03:05:17.039 --> 03:05:22.111 region:rollup2
PROVED DIFFICULT AND TIMELY AND

03:05:19.675 --> 03:05:24.380 region:rollup2
IT WAS TIME THAT MY MOM RAPIDLY

03:05:22.111 --> 03:05:27.617 region:rollup2
DO NOT HAVE AND.

03:05:24.380 --> 03:05:28.985 region:rollup2
ONCE A DOCTOR WAS FOUND THEN IT

03:05:27.617 --> 03:05:30.620 region:rollup2
WAS A DISCUSSION ABOUT COULD WE

03:05:28.985 --> 03:05:31.787 region:rollup2
HAVE THIS PERSON DO A HOME VISIT

03:05:30.620 --> 03:05:33.189 region:rollup2
BECAUSE MY MOM WAS TOO WEAK TO

03:05:31.787 --> 03:05:35.091 region:rollup2
LEAVE.

03:05:33.189 --> 03:05:37.059 region:rollup2
HER HOME AND THEN THAT ENSUED

03:05:35.091 --> 03:05:38.928 region:rollup2
MULTIPLE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT

03:05:37.059 --> 03:05:40.529 region:rollup2
WHAT CONSTITUTED BATTERY.

03:05:38.928 --> 03:05:42.565 region:rollup2
AND SO THAT WAS DIFFICULT.

03:05:40.529 --> 03:05:44.066 region:rollup2
.

03:05:42.565 --> 03:05:45.901 region:rollup2
AND SO FINALLY WHEN THE DOCTOR

03:05:44.066 --> 03:05:48.738 region:rollup2
CAME IN HE WAS GREAT I MEAN HE'S

03:05:45.901 --> 03:05:50.239 region:rollup2
COMPASSIONATE KIND PATIENT AND

03:05:48.738 --> 03:05:51.841 region:rollup2
IN ANOTHER THIS IS A REFLECTION

03:05:50.239 --> 03:05:53.709 region:rollup2
OF THE PHYSICIANS THE HOSPICE

03:05:51.841 --> 03:05:54.944 region:rollup2
CARE WORKERS. ALL OF THEM WERE

03:05:53.709 --> 03:05:56.278 region:rollup2
PHENOMENAL IF IT'S JUST ABOUT

03:05:54.944 --> 03:05:58.047 region:rollup2
THE.

03:05:56.278 --> 03:05:58.347 region:rollup2
OBSTACLES THAT WERE BUILT INTO

03:05:58.047 --> 03:06:00.316 region:rollup2
THE SYSTEM.

03:05:58.347 --> 03:06:01.283 region:rollup2
.

03:06:00.316 --> 03:06:02.818 region:rollup2
BY THE TIME HE SHOWED UP HER

03:06:01.283 --> 03:06:04.720 region:rollup2
HOUSE SHE CAN NO LONGER

03:06:02.818 --> 03:06:07.089 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATE IN A MEANINGFUL WAY

03:06:04.720 --> 03:06:09.625 region:rollup2
IN THIS INTERVIEW SHE COULD SAY.

03:06:07.089 --> 03:06:10.693 region:rollup2
I AM DYING I HAVE THIS CANCER I

03:06:09.625 --> 03:06:11.994 region:rollup2
WANT THIS EIGHTEEN DOWN AYE

03:06:10.693 --> 03:06:13.362 region:rollup2
MEDICATION BECAUSE I DON'T WANT

03:06:11.994 --> 03:06:15.131 region:rollup2
TO BE IN PAIN BUT THERE WAS A

03:06:13.362 --> 03:06:17.099 region:rollup2
WHOLE LIST OF OTHER QUESTIONS

03:06:15.131 --> 03:06:18.134 region:rollup2
THAT SHE CAN ANSWER. PART NOT TO

03:06:17.099 --> 03:06:19.602 region:rollup2
HIS STANDARD BUT TO THE LOS

03:06:18.134 --> 03:06:22.738 region:rollup2
STANDARD.

03:06:19.602 --> 03:06:24.240 region:rollup2
AND SO SHE WASN'T ABLE TO TAKE

03:06:22.738 --> 03:06:25.441 region:rollup2
ADVANTAGE OF THIS AND.

03:06:24.240 --> 03:06:27.476 region:rollup2
.

03:06:25.441 --> 03:06:29.011 region:rollup2
THAT WAS.

03:06:27.476 --> 03:06:30.312 region:rollup2
REALLY DIFFICULT BECAUSE I THINK

03:06:29.011 --> 03:06:32.748 region:rollup2
MORE THAN ANYTHING SHE LIKE

03:06:30.312 --> 03:06:33.549 region:rollup2
OTHERS AT THIS PANEL AND TODAY

03:06:32.748 --> 03:06:34.617 region:rollup2
HAVE SAID SHE JUST WANTED THE

03:06:33.549 --> 03:06:35.584 region:rollup2
OPTION.

03:06:34.617 --> 03:06:38.020 region:rollup2
SHE WON THE CHOICE.

03:06:35.584 --> 03:06:39.388 region:rollup2
.

03:06:38.020 --> 03:06:40.189 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THE LAST THING I'LL

03:06:39.388 --> 03:06:42.625 region:rollup2
SAY ABOUT MY MOM IS.

03:06:40.189 --> 03:06:44.860 region:rollup2
.

03:06:42.625 --> 03:06:46.929 region:rollup2
SHE YOU KNOW WHO I BEFORE I WAS

03:06:44.860 --> 03:06:48.798 region:rollup2
AROUND.

03:06:46.929 --> 03:06:51.767 region:rollup2
IN ADDITION SHE GREW UP IN

03:06:48.798 --> 03:06:53.202 region:rollup2
GERMANY POST WAR POVERTY SHE WAS

03:06:51.767 --> 03:06:55.204 region:rollup2
AND IMMIGRANTS USES

03:06:53.202 --> 03:06:56.605 region:rollup2
SINGLE WORKING MOM WHEN THAT WAS

03:06:55.204 --> 03:06:59.642 region:rollup2
TABOO.

03:06:56.605 --> 03:07:02.878 region:rollup2
SHE WAS A PRO CHOICE ADVOCATE

03:06:59.642 --> 03:07:04.880 region:rollup2
BEFORE ROE V. WADE. SHE WAS

03:07:02.878 --> 03:07:06.582 region:rollup2
ALWAYS KIND OF PUSHING THESE

03:07:04.880 --> 03:07:08.884 region:rollup2
BOUNDARIES AND NOT SO MUCH AS.

03:07:06.582 --> 03:07:10.319 region:rollup2
JUST.

03:07:08.884 --> 03:07:12.621 region:rollup2
THROUGH ACTION CENTER LIFE AND

03:07:10.319 --> 03:07:14.323 region:rollup2
HER LIVED EXPERIENCE.

03:07:12.621 --> 03:07:16.559 region:rollup2
AND WHEN THE WORLD LETTER DOWN

03:07:14.323 --> 03:07:18.394 region:rollup2
IT WAS BECAUSE IT WASN'T AS

03:07:16.559 --> 03:07:21.864 region:rollup2
COMPASSIONATE OR FORWARD

03:07:18.394 --> 03:07:24.700 region:rollup2
THINKING OR BRAVE AS SHE WAS.

03:07:21.864 --> 03:07:26.235 region:rollup2
AND THIS CALIFORNIA WAS OUR HOME

03:07:24.700 --> 03:07:27.970 region:rollup2
AND. IF.

03:07:26.235 --> 03:07:29.405 region:rollup2
WE CAN TAKE.

03:07:27.970 --> 03:07:30.573 region:rollup2

03:13:35.404 --> 03:13:38.240 region:rollup2
JUICE.

03:13:36.572 --> 03:13:39.641 region:rollup2
I JUST QUALIFIED PATIENTS

WHILE THE LAW AS AS I UNDERSTOOD

03:14:36.398 --> 03:14:40.335 region:rollup2
IT AT THE TIME.

03:14:38.133 --> 03:14:41.970 region:rollup2
IT ALLOWS CARE GIVERS TO

03:14:40.335 --> 03:14:44.506 region:rollup2
PROVIDE SOME ASSISTANCE.

03:14:41.970 --> 03:14:47.142 region:rollup2

THERE'S ONE DISEASE THAT.

03:15:03.725 --> 03:15:08.263 region:rollup2

PHARMACIST.

03:19:36.364 --> 03:19:40.936 region:rollup2

FIRST AN ANTI NAUSEA DRUG.

03:19:45.674 --> 03:19:51.346 region:rollup2
THEN ONE TO SLOW THE HEART. AND

03:19:48.109 --> 03:19:53.481 region:rollup2
KEEP IT FROM GOING TOO FAST.

03:19:51.346 --> 03:19:56.284 region:rollup2
AND THEN NINETY SECOND ALL'S

03:19:53.481 --> 03:19:57.152 region:rollup2

NINETY SECOND ALL'S ALSO IS A

03:20:02.557 --> 03:20:09.865 region:rollup2
TOXIC SLUDGE.

03:20:05.560 --> 03:20:13.635 region:rollup2

SUGAR IN IT.

03:20:21.710 --> 03:20:26.181 region:rollup2

ALAN IF MY FATHER HAD.

03:22:23.965 --> 03:22:27.502 region:rollup2
DR JON MINOR COULD SEE ME SEATED

HE WOULD FEEL EXTREME HAPPINESS

03:22:31.239 --> 03:22:35.276 region:rollup2
AND GRATITUDE.

03:22:33.375 --> 03:22:36.077 region:rollup2
HE WAS ONE WEEK SHY OF HIS

03:22:35.276 --> 03:22:38.013 region:rollup2
EIGHTY FIRST BIRTHDAY ON THE

03:22:36.077 --> 03:22:39.648 region:rollup2
EVENING HE OPTED TO PUT A

03:22:38.013 --> 03:22:41.683 region:rollup2
PERMANENT END TO HIS SUFFERING.

03:22:39.648 --> 03:22:43.885 region:rollup2
IT WAS SEPTEMBER FIFTEENTH TWO

03:22:41.683 --> 03:22:45.620 region:rollup2
THOUSAND SIXTEEN. HE'D FOUGHT

03:22:43.885 --> 03:22:47.389 region:rollup2
FOR TWO YEARS THROUGH WHAT I

03:22:45.620 --> 03:22:50.158 region:rollup2
CONSIDERED TO BE UNIMAGINABLE

03:22:47.389 --> 03:22:51.793 region:rollup2
SUFFERING. HE HAD PULMONARY

03:22:50.158 --> 03:22:55.096 region:rollup2
FIBROSIS.

03:22:51.793 --> 03:22:57.399 region:rollup2
OTHER DOCTORS JUST DEEMED IT A.

03:22:55.096 --> 03:22:59.467 region:rollup2
RARE TERMINAL LUNG DISEASE.

03:22:57.399 --> 03:23:00.802 region:rollup2
MANY OF THE DOCTORS DIDN'T HAVE

03:22:59.467 --> 03:23:02.671 region:rollup2
A VERY GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF HIS

03:23:00.802 --> 03:23:04.372 region:rollup2
ILLNESS.

03:23:02.671 --> 03:23:06.241 region:rollup2
HIS CONDITION WENT FROM VIOLIN

03:23:04.372 --> 03:23:08.977 region:rollup2
EXTENDED COUGHING FITS TOO

03:23:06.241 --> 03:23:11.346 region:rollup2
EXTREME OXYGEN DEPRIVATION TO

03:23:08.977 --> 03:23:12.981 region:rollup2
EXCESSIVE MUCOUS AND HIS LUNGS.

03:23:11.346 --> 03:23:14.115 region:rollup2
WHERE WE NOTICE THAT MORE COULD

03:23:12.981 --> 03:23:15.450 region:rollup2
REALLY HAVE BEEN DONE TO

03:23:14.115 --> 03:23:17.052 region:rollup2
MAXIMIZE HIS MOBILITY AND WELL

03:23:15.450 --> 03:23:18.787 region:rollup2
BEING?

03:23:17.052 --> 03:23:19.754 region:rollup2
WE HAD TO AGGRESSIVELY ADVOCATE

03:23:18.787 --> 03:23:21.723 region:rollup2
FOR HIM THROUGH MOST OF HIS

03:23:19.754 --> 03:23:23.525 region:rollup2
ILLNESS.

03:23:21.723 --> 03:23:25.393 region:rollup2
HE SPENT HIS REMAINING MONTHS

03:23:23.525 --> 03:23:27.629 region:rollup2
WEEKS AND DAYS AND RELENTLESS

03:23:25.393 --> 03:23:30.098 region:rollup2
ATTEMPTS TO COMPOSE HIS STORY

03:23:27.629 --> 03:23:32.033 region:rollup2
AND A PERSONAL STATEMENT TITLED

03:23:30.098 --> 03:23:33.535 region:rollup2
THE RIGHT TO ASSISTED DYING. HIS

03:23:32.033 --> 03:23:35.804 region:rollup2
FOCUS LAY IN BROADENING THE

03:23:33.535 --> 03:23:37.706 region:rollup2
DIALOGUE ON ASSISTED DYING. SO

03:23:35.804 --> 03:23:39.007 region:rollup2
MY FAMILY HAD MANY CONVERSATIONS

03:23:37.706 --> 03:23:41.276 region:rollup2
ABOUT IT.

03:23:39.007 --> 03:23:43.445 region:rollup2
MORPHINE AND FENTANYL OF MAY

03:23:41.276 --> 03:23:45.613 region:rollup2
THINGS POT FOGGY. BUT STILL WITH

03:23:43.445 --> 03:23:47.182 region:rollup2
GREAT LUCIDITY HE WAS ABLE TO

03:23:45.613 --> 03:23:49.050 region:rollup2
SAY THAN WHAT HE WOULD OF PRO

03:23:47.182 --> 03:23:50.919 region:rollup2
FAMILY WANTED TO HAVE BEEN ABLE

03:23:49.050 --> 03:23:54.022 region:rollup2
TO SAY TO ALL OF YOU. IN PERSON

03:23:50.919 --> 03:23:55.323 region:rollup2
TODAY SO THESE ARE HIS WORDS.

03:23:54.022 --> 03:23:57.525 region:rollup2
I WANT TO EXPRESS MY DEEPEST

03:23:55.323 --> 03:23:58.293 region:rollup2
GRATITUDE TO THOSE OF YOU WHO

03:23:57.525 --> 03:23:59.728 region:rollup2
FOUGHT TO BRING THIS ISSUE

03:23:58.293 --> 03:24:02.130 region:rollup2
FORWARD.

03:23:59.728 --> 03:24:03.231 region:rollup2
I AM MOST GRATEFUL AND EXTREMELY

03:24:02.130 --> 03:24:05.667 region:rollup2
RELIEVED TO EXPERIENCE YOUR

03:24:03.231 --> 03:24:08.036 region:rollup2
COMPASSION JUSTICE ENCOURAGE IN

03:24:05.667 --> 03:24:09.637 region:rollup2
THE ONGOING STRUGGLE TO MAKE

03:24:08.036 --> 03:24:11.973 region:rollup2
THIS AVAILABLE TO ALL.

03:24:09.637 --> 03:24:13.575 region:rollup2
MY DAD THOUGHT MANY DOCTORS OVER

03:24:11.973 --> 03:24:15.210 region:rollup2
THOSE TWO YEARS AND WE WERE

03:24:13.575 --> 03:24:16.778 region:rollup2
UNABLE TO FIND ANYONE WHO WOULD

03:24:15.210 --> 03:24:18.713 region:rollup2
CONSIDER SUPPORTING HIS WISHES

03:24:16.778 --> 03:24:20.448 region:rollup2
FOR MEDICAL AID IN DYING.

03:24:18.713 --> 03:24:21.950 region:rollup2
MOST OF THEM WERE RELUCTANT TO

03:24:20.448 --> 03:24:23.752 region:rollup2
EVEN DISCUSS IT AS AN OPTION

03:24:21.950 --> 03:24:25.653 region:rollup2
AFTER THE LAW HAD PASSED.

03:24:23.752 --> 03:24:27.655 region:rollup2
AT THAT TIME WHAT I DESIRED MORE

03:24:25.653 --> 03:24:29.724 region:rollup2
THAN ANYTHING WAS A DATABASE

03:24:27.655 --> 03:24:30.325 region:rollup2
WITH DOCTORS WHO WOULD SUPPORT

03:24:29.724 --> 03:24:31.426 region:rollup2
MY FATHER'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE IS

03:24:30.325 --> 03:24:33.161 region:rollup2
DEATH.

03:24:31.426 --> 03:24:35.430 region:rollup2
SHOULD HE MEET THE CRITERIA SET

03:24:33.161 --> 03:24:38.066 region:rollup2
FORTH IN THE LOT. IN BETWEEN

03:24:35.430 --> 03:24:39.868 region:rollup2
RESEARCHING A FAMILY MOVED ORGAN

03:24:38.066 --> 03:24:41.536 region:rollup2
AND COLD CALLING HOSPITALS

03:24:39.868 --> 03:24:43.538 region:rollup2
LOOKING FOR A DOCTOR. WE

03:24:41.536 --> 03:24:44.672 region:rollup2
STRUGGLE TO OBTAIN PRESCRIPTIONS

03:24:43.538 --> 03:24:46.641 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD MEET MY FATHER'S

03:24:44.672 --> 03:24:48.176 region:rollup2
NEEDS WHILE HIS CODEINE COUGH

03:24:46.641 --> 03:24:49.711 region:rollup2
SYRUP WAS INITIALLY PRESCRIBED

03:24:48.176 --> 03:24:50.912 region:rollup2
FOR EVERY SIX HOURS.

03:24:49.711 --> 03:24:52.480 region:rollup2
THE ADMINISTRATION OF HIS

03:24:50.912 --> 03:24:54.182 region:rollup2
DOSAGES SOON REQUIRED GREATER

03:24:52.480 --> 03:24:55.583 region:rollup2
FREQUENCY AND WE WERE OFTEN LEFT

03:24:54.182 --> 03:24:57.418 region:rollup2
SCRAMBLING TO OBTAIN THE

03:24:55.583 --> 03:24:59.187 region:rollup2
NECESSARY PRESCRIPTIONS.

03:24:57.418 --> 03:25:00.455 region:rollup2
WE REPEATEDLY DEALT WITH NEARLY

03:24:59.187 --> 03:25:02.023 region:rollup2
RUNNING OUT OF ALL DIFFERENT

03:25:00.455 --> 03:25:03.224 region:rollup2
TYPES OF MEDICINE.

03:25:02.023 --> 03:25:04.592 region:rollup2
DURING THOSE TIMES WE WERE

03:25:03.224 --> 03:25:05.927 region:rollup2
ALWAYS SCARED THAT HIS SUFFERING

03:25:04.592 --> 03:25:06.895 region:rollup2
WOULD SPIKE AND WE WOULD NOT

03:25:05.927 --> 03:25:09.230 region:rollup2
HAVE THE RIGHT MEDICATION TO

03:25:06.895 --> 03:25:10.498 region:rollup2
PROPERLY TREAT HIM.

03:25:09.230 --> 03:25:11.1000 region:rollup2
ONCE OR TWICE WE THOUGHT WE WERE

03:25:10.498 --> 03:25:14.102 region:rollup2
REALLY CLOSE TO FINDING THE

03:25:11.1000 --> 03:25:15.103 region:rollup2
RIGHT HOSPICE PROVIDER. AND THEN

03:25:14.102 --> 03:25:17.005 region:rollup2
THEY WOULDN'T HAVE ANY

03:25:15.103 --> 03:25:18.506 region:rollup2
PRESCRIBING DOCTOR IS. DURING

03:25:17.005 --> 03:25:20.341 region:rollup2
ONE OF MY COLD CALLS I REACHED

03:25:18.506 --> 03:25:22.010 region:rollup2
THE END OF LIFE COORDINATOR AT

03:25:20.341 --> 03:25:23.478 region:rollup2
KAISER IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.

03:25:22.010 --> 03:25:24.712 region:rollup2
I HAD FINALLY FOUND A HEALTH

03:25:23.478 --> 03:25:26.414 region:rollup2
CARE PROFESSIONAL THAT

03:25:24.712 --> 03:25:28.416 region:rollup2
PERSONALLY NEW DOCTORS WILLING

03:25:26.414 --> 03:25:30.552 region:rollup2
TO PRESCRIBE THE MEDICATION.

03:25:28.416 --> 03:25:31.753 region:rollup2
CONNECTING WITH THIS WOMAN WAS

03:25:30.552 --> 03:25:33.888 region:rollup2
IN LARGE PART DUE TO THE

03:25:31.753 --> 03:25:35.657 region:rollup2
COMPASSION AND CHOICES WEBSITE.

03:25:33.888 --> 03:25:36.925 region:rollup2
WHICH REPEATEDLY PROVED A

03:25:35.657 --> 03:25:38.960 region:rollup2
CRITICAL RESOURCE THAT IN WHAT

03:25:36.925 --> 03:25:41.162 region:rollup2
FELT LIKE A VERY UNINFORMED

03:25:38.960 --> 03:25:43.264 region:rollup2
UNPREPARED DISCONNECTED MEDICAL

03:25:41.162 --> 03:25:45.133 region:rollup2
WORLD. IT WAS A MAJOR

03:25:43.264 --> 03:25:46.701 region:rollup2
BREAKTHROUGH IN OUR JOURNEY.

03:25:45.133 --> 03:25:48.369 region:rollup2
TWENTY TWO MONTHS INTO MY DAD'S

03:25:46.701 --> 03:25:50.104 region:rollup2
TREATMENT WE YANKED HIM FROM ALL

03:25:48.369 --> 03:25:52.173 region:rollup2
OF HIS DOCTORS AND NURSES AND

03:25:50.104 --> 03:25:53.641 region:rollup2
ENROLLED HIM IN KAISER.

03:25:52.173 --> 03:25:55.343 region:rollup2
IT WAS A BIG DECISION THAT WE

03:25:53.641 --> 03:25:57.212 region:rollup2
DID NOT TAKE LIGHTLY. WITHIN

03:25:55.343 --> 03:25:58.646 region:rollup2
WEEKS HE HAD HIS MEDICAL RECORDS

03:25:57.212 --> 03:26:00.014 region:rollup2
TRANSFERRED WAS ENROLLED IN

03:25:58.646 --> 03:26:02.250 region:rollup2
HOSPICE AND ASSESSED FOR END OF

03:26:00.014 --> 03:26:04.485 region:rollup2
LIFE MEDICATION. IT BROUGHT HIM

03:26:02.250 --> 03:26:06.054 region:rollup2
TREMENDOUS PIECE ONCE HE BEGAN

03:26:04.485 --> 03:26:07.755 region:rollup2
THIS PROCESS WITH KAISER.

03:26:06.054 --> 03:26:09.524 region:rollup2
I CALLED ON HOSPICE FOR GUIDANCE

03:26:07.755 --> 03:26:11.392 region:rollup2
AND SUPPORT SEVERAL TIMES IN HIS

03:26:09.524 --> 03:26:13.127 region:rollup2
FINAL FEW WEEKS A DIFFERENT

03:26:11.392 --> 03:26:14.662 region:rollup2
PERSON WOULD COME EACH TIME. AND

03:26:13.127 --> 03:26:16.331 region:rollup2
EACH ONE WHEN THEY WENT DOWN THE

03:26:14.662 --> 03:26:17.932 region:rollup2
ROAD OF A PLAN FOR TREATMENT FOR

03:26:16.331 --> 03:26:19.567 region:rollup2
THAT DAY OR THAT WEEK WE FELT

03:26:17.932 --> 03:26:21.536 region:rollup2
COMPELLED TO TELL THEM. SAVE

03:26:19.567 --> 03:26:22.971 region:rollup2
YOUR BREATH HERE THAT HE'S GOING

03:26:21.536 --> 03:26:24.906 region:rollup2
TO END HIS LIFE VERY SOON.

03:26:22.971 --> 03:26:26.874 region:rollup2
IT WAS A DIFFICULT CONVERSATION

03:26:24.906 --> 03:26:28.543 region:rollup2
TO HAVE TO KEEP REPEATING.

03:26:26.874 --> 03:26:29.777 region:rollup2
ALL OF THE HOSPICE STAFF HAD

03:26:28.543 --> 03:26:31.546 region:rollup2
OPINIONS ABOUT MY DAD'S FINAL

03:26:29.777 --> 03:26:33.348 region:rollup2
CHOICE.

03:26:31.546 --> 03:26:34.849 region:rollup2
ONE OF THEM WAS VERY FORCEFUL IN

03:26:33.348 --> 03:26:36.618 region:rollup2
THAT HIS DECISION WAS WRONG AND

03:26:34.849 --> 03:26:37.919 region:rollup2
BASICALLY A MORAL.

03:26:36.618 --> 03:26:40.021 region:rollup2
SHE DIDN'T EVEN BELIEVE IN

03:26:37.919 --> 03:26:42.056 region:rollup2
TAKING MEDICATION WHICH IS WHAT

03:26:40.021 --> 03:26:43.858 region:rollup2
HAD KEPT MY DAD ALIVE TO THAT

03:26:42.056 --> 03:26:45.593 region:rollup2
POINT HOSPICE.

03:26:43.858 --> 03:26:46.895 region:rollup2
SHOULD SUPPORT THE DECISIONS OF

03:26:45.593 --> 03:26:48.463 region:rollup2
THE PATIENT NOT JUDGE AND

03:26:46.895 --> 03:26:49.898 region:rollup2
CRITICIZE THE SHOULD BE A CORE

03:26:48.463 --> 03:26:51.599 region:rollup2
VALUE DOWN TO EVERY LAST CARE

THEY WERE INFORMED SORT OF.

03:36:10.858 --> 03:36:14.061 region:rollup2

WONDERFUL WE FOUND OUT

03:36:14.795 --> 03:36:18.732 region:rollup2
AFTERWARDS.

03:36:16.564 --> 03:36:21.802 region:rollup2
THAT HE HAD NO EXPERIENCE WITH

03:36:18.732 --> 03:36:22.636 region:rollup2
A REAL LIFE PERSON WHO IS DYING.

03:36:21.802 --> 03:36:24.038 region:rollup2
AND THERE WERE SOME PROBLEMS

03:36:22.636 --> 03:36:25.973 region:rollup2
WITH THAT.

03:36:24.038 --> 03:36:27.775 region:rollup2
MAIN THING I WANT TO THANK YOU

03:36:25.973 --> 03:36:29.710 region:rollup2
FOR THE LAW WE BEEN FOLLOWING

03:36:27.775 --> 03:36:31.011 region:rollup2
THIS FOR LONG TIME.

03:36:29.710 --> 03:36:32.880 region:rollup2
FROM THE DAYS OF DOCTOR

03:36:31.011 --> 03:36:34.982 region:rollup2
KEVORKIAN WHO WAS WAY AHEAD OF

03:36:32.880 --> 03:36:36.517 region:rollup2
HIS TIME AND SO IN OUR FAMILY WE

03:36:34.982 --> 03:36:37.818 region:rollup2
HAVE DISCUSSED THIS AND WE COME

03:36:36.517 --> 03:36:39.920 region:rollup2
FROM A MEDICAL FAMILY.

03:36:37.818 --> 03:36:41.021 region:rollup2
.

03:36:39.920 --> 03:36:42.890 region:rollup2
HAVING THAT THE MEDICINE WAS A

03:36:41.021 --> 03:36:45.125 region:rollup2
COMFORT.

03:36:42.890 --> 03:36:46.827 region:rollup2
A IT DOES GIVE PEOPLE A CHOICE

03:36:45.125 --> 03:36:48.162 region:rollup2
IT GIVES THEM THE SENSE OF

03:36:46.827 --> 03:36:49.830 region:rollup2
SATISFACTION IN FACT THEY

03:36:48.162 --> 03:36:51.699 region:rollup2
FOUNDED WITH RESEARCH ANALYST

03:36:49.830 --> 03:36:53.267 region:rollup2
LESIA. THAT PEOPLE HAVE

03:36:51.699 --> 03:36:53.868 region:rollup2
ANESTHESIA AT HOME POST

03:36:53.267 --> 03:36:54.902 region:rollup2
OPERATIVE OR WHATEVER THEY USE

03:36:53.868 --> 03:36:56.203 region:rollup2
LESS

03:36:54.902 --> 03:36:58.973 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY HAVE CONTROL OF IT

03:36:56.203 --> 03:37:00.808 region:rollup2
THEMSELVES THAT WAS HUGE FOR US.

03:36:58.973 --> 03:37:02.710 region:rollup2
ALSO I MUST SAY THAT.

03:37:00.808 --> 03:37:04.979 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE HAD THE TIME TO BUILD

03:37:02.710 --> 03:37:06.247 region:rollup2
UP TO THE TO THE END.

03:37:04.979 --> 03:37:07.715 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE DID IT TOGETHER

03:37:06.247 --> 03:37:11.118 region:rollup2
BECAUSE MY SISTER WAS AT HOME

03:37:07.715 --> 03:37:12.620 region:rollup2
WITH FAMILY.

03:37:11.118 --> 03:37:15.990 region:rollup2
BUT THEY CAN'T TELL RIGHT NOW

03:37:12.620 --> 03:37:17.691 region:rollup2
THE POST GRIEVING IS EASIER THAN

03:37:15.990 --> 03:37:19.059 region:rollup2
ANY GRIEVING I'VE BEEN THROUGH

03:37:17.691 --> 03:37:20.995 region:rollup2
WITH OTHER MEMBERS OF MY FAMILY

03:37:19.059 --> 03:37:23.531 region:rollup2
WHO HAVE DIED SUDDENLY.

03:37:20.995 --> 03:37:26.066 region:rollup2
SO IT'S A BLESSING FOR THE

03:37:23.531 --> 03:37:27.902 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WHO ARE DYING AND I THINK

03:37:26.066 --> 03:37:29.436 region:rollup2
IF IT WERE ANY INDICATION FOR

03:37:27.902 --> 03:37:31.572 region:rollup2
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE LEFT BEHIND

03:37:29.436 --> 03:37:33.874 region:rollup2
REMEMBERING.

03:37:31.572 --> 03:37:34.942 region:rollup2
NO ONE MORE THING LAST THING.

03:37:33.874 --> 03:37:37.912 region:rollup2
BOTH MY SONS ARE PHYSICIANS THEY

03:37:34.942 --> 03:37:38.812 region:rollup2
WERE WITH US.

03:37:37.912 --> 03:37:40.481 region:rollup2
WE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THE

03:37:38.812 --> 03:37:41.482 region:rollup2
MEDICATION.

03:37:40.481 --> 03:37:44.084 region:rollup2
THERE WAS THE.

03:37:41.482 --> 03:37:45.085 region:rollup2
COCKTAIL BEFOREHAND SO THAT SHE

03:37:44.084 --> 03:37:46.921 region:rollup2
WOULDN'T BE NAUSEOUS THAN

03:37:45.085 --> 03:37:47.721 region:rollup2
SOMEONE.

03:37:46.921 --> 03:37:49.623 region:rollup2
AND THEN WE SHE HAD THIS SEEK IN

03:37:47.721 --> 03:37:51.559 region:rollup2
OUR.

03:37:49.623 --> 03:37:52.793 region:rollup2
WHAT I'M HEARING HERE IS THAT

03:37:51.559 --> 03:37:54.261 region:rollup2
THERE ISN'T ANY THERE ARE

03:37:52.793 --> 03:37:56.530 region:rollup2
ALTERNATIVES LESS EXPENSIVE

03:37:54.261 --> 03:37:57.731 region:rollup2
ALTERNATIVES THERE'S A HOME?

03:37:56.530 --> 03:37:59.867 region:rollup2
PHARMACIES THAT CAN.

03:37:57.731 --> 03:38:01.902 region:rollup2
CAN COMBINE.

03:37:59.867 --> 03:38:03.370 region:rollup2
MEDICATIONS WE DIDN'T KNOW THAT

03:38:01.902 --> 03:38:04.738 region:rollup2
WE NEVER HEARD IT THAT WOULD BE

03:38:03.370 --> 03:38:06.774 region:rollup2
NICE TO KNOW THAT THEIR

03:38:04.738 --> 03:38:08.576 region:rollup2
ALTERNATIVES I WAS READING MY

03:38:06.774 --> 03:38:09.944 region:rollup2
SON'S READ WE NEVER HEARD THAT I

03:38:08.576 --> 03:38:11.812 region:rollup2
READ THAT.

03:38:09.944 --> 03:38:13.781 region:rollup2
BUT AS SHE WAS DYING ISSUES A

03:38:11.812 --> 03:38:16.150 region:rollup2
HUNDRED POUNDS MAY BE AND WE

03:38:13.781 --> 03:38:18.252 region:rollup2
WERE TOLD THAT MAYBE IN AN HOUR

03:38:16.150 --> 03:38:19.920 region:rollup2
OR SO SHE WOULD DIE.

03:38:18.252 --> 03:38:21.689 region:rollup2
TOOK A SIX AND A HALF HOURS JUST

03:38:19.920 --> 03:38:23.691 region:rollup2
THE LONGEST TIME THAT WE WERE

03:38:21.689 --> 03:38:24.558 region:rollup2
TOLD TO USUALLY FIVE HOURS WITH

03:38:23.691 --> 03:38:27.027 region:rollup2
THE OUT SIDE.

03:38:24.558 --> 03:38:28.529 region:rollup2
THAT WAS.

03:38:27.027 --> 03:38:29.997 region:rollup2
EXCRUCIATING FOR THOSE OF US WHO

03:38:28.529 --> 03:38:31.599 region:rollup2
WERE WATCHING HER DIET NOT FOR

03:38:29.997 --> 03:38:33.067 region:rollup2
HER SHE WAS PEACEFUL SHE WAS IN

03:38:31.599 --> 03:38:35.169 region:rollup2
A COMA RIGHT AWAY. IT WAS

03:38:33.067 --> 03:38:37.338 region:rollup2
WONDERFUL FOR HER.

03:38:35.169 --> 03:38:39.940 region:rollup2
I WOULD JUST SUGGEST THAT

03:38:37.338 --> 03:38:41.375 region:rollup2
THERE'S MORE INFORMATION ON THE

03:38:39.940 --> 03:38:42.576 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT TYPES OF MEDICATION.

03:38:41.375 --> 03:38:43.944 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY HOPEFULLY TO BRING THE

03:38:42.576 --> 03:38:46.947 region:rollup2
PRICE DOWN AS WELL.

03:38:43.944 --> 03:38:49.783 region:rollup2
AND.

03:38:46.947 --> 03:38:51.418 region:rollup2
OUR HOSPICE AT KAISER DIDN'T

03:38:49.783 --> 03:38:52.920 region:rollup2
SAID THEY COULDN'T BE PRESENT

03:38:51.418 --> 03:38:54.922 region:rollup2
ONE WHEN SHE TOOK THE MEDICINE

03:38:52.920 --> 03:38:56.423 region:rollup2
AND DIED THAT HASN'T BEEN MY

03:38:54.922 --> 03:38:57.992 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE WITH PREVIOUS HOSPICE

03:38:56.423 --> 03:38:58.158 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE.

03:38:57.992 --> 03:39:00.027 region:rollup2
AND.

03:38:58.158 --> 03:39:01.528 region:rollup2
.

03:39:00.027 --> 03:39:02.429 region:rollup2
I DON'T KNOW I UNDERSTAND THAT

03:39:01.528 --> 03:39:04.164 region:rollup2
BUT THAT WOULD OF BEEN HELPFUL

03:39:02.429 --> 03:39:05.833 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY WOULD HAVE HAD.

03:39:04.164 --> 03:39:07.968 region:rollup2
MAYBE MORE MORPHINE MORE

03:39:05.833 --> 03:39:09.536 region:rollup2
MEDICATIONS TO GIVE HER.

03:39:07.968 --> 03:39:10.771 region:rollup2
AS SHE WAS IN HER COMA TO BOB

03:39:09.536 --> 03:39:12.606 region:rollup2
AND.

03:39:10.771 --> 03:39:15.009 region:rollup2
SPEED IS THAT SHE WOULD HAVE

03:39:12.606 --> 03:39:16.243 region:rollup2
HATED TO MOUNTAIN LINGER SHE

03:39:15.009 --> 03:39:17.878 region:rollup2
REALLY PHOTO BE FASTER.

03:39:16.243 --> 03:39:19.279 region:rollup2
SO ANYWAY THANK YOU FOR THE

03:39:17.878 --> 03:39:21.949 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO WORK PONCE TO

03:39:19.279 --> 03:39:22.549 region:rollup2
