TWELVE WHAT ONE SECOND SENTIMENTAL TAKE YOUR MICROPHONE IS ON WHAT DO I DO TO I WAS ON A HIGH THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE. ON BEHALF OF THE API LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS ALONG WITH DR PAN I'M PRESENTING SR TWELVE. A RESOLUTION CONDEMNING THE HATE THAT THE ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER COMMUNITY HAS FACED IN LIGHT OF THIS PANDEMIC. AND ASKING FOR SUPPORT FROM THIS BODY THE STATE SENATE. OF COURSE API HE IS NOT NEW TO AMERICA OR EVEN CALIFORNIA. BUT AS BOLD AS THE HISTORY OF ASIAN IMMIGRATION ITSELF. LONG AGO ASIAN AMERICANS WERE SUBJECTED TO THE YELLOW PERIL RHETORIC OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY. WHICH WAS ACCOMPANIED BY A WIDE ARRAY OF HATEFUL AND VIOLENT ACTS. API'S ALSO SUBJECTED TO GROSSLY DISCRIMINATORY LAWS. AT THE LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL LEVELS. IN FACT WELL IN THE TWO CENTS OVER A CENTURY THE IN FIFTEENTH THAT PLAN. OR ADOPT. I SPENT WE PUT EACH RIGHTS OF ALL WHO WERE BOTH HERE IN THIS COUNTRY REGARDLESS OF RACE. ASIAN WERE FOR EMIGRATING TO THIS COUNTRY. AND THOSE ALREADY HERE ONE ON TO COME CITIZENS VOTE. SERVE INJURIES OR MANY STATES EVEN PURCHASE PROPERTY. JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO WE MARKED THE SEVENTY NINTH ANNIVERSARY OF PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT'S EXECUTIVE ORDER NINETY SIXTY SIX. WHICH AUTHORIZED INTERNMENT OF JAPANESE AMERICANS. THIS WAS ONE OF THE MOST SHAMEFUL ACTIONS OF THE ROOSEVELT ADMINISTRATION AND A STAIN ON OUR COUNTRY'S HISTORY. AND IT WAS NOT UNTIL NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE THE RESTRICTIONS ON ASIAN IMMIGRATION WERE LIFTED. MY PARENTS LIKE MANY ASIAN IMMIGRANTS WERE PART OF THAT FIRST POST NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE WE'VE IN GRAYSON. BUT THAT WAS THEN AND THIS IS NOW RIGHT. WE LIVE IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE TODAY ASIAN AMERICANS AND PACIFIC ISLANDERS ARE LEADERS AND BUSINESS LABOR FINANCE ENTERTAINMENT TECHNOLOGY ACADEMIA AND POLITICS. WE CELEBRATED THE ELECTION OF COMELEC HARRIS AS THE FIRST ASIAN AMERICAN TO THE WHITE HOUSE. WE SAW THE FIRST ASIAN MOVIE BEEN ARE ARE NOT MINORITY. I'M SORRY I'M BLANKING ON THE NAME OF AT THE MOMENT BE WIN BEST PICTURE LAST YEAR ANOTHER AMERICAN MOVIE ABOUT ASIAN AMERICANS AND IMMIGRATION. GET NOMINATED FOR BEST PICTURE THIS YEAR. BUT DESPITE ALL THESE ACCOMPLISHMENTS FOR ASIAN AMERICANS NOW IS A TIME OF INCREDIBLE UNCERTAINTY AND FEAR. AND THAT IS WHY THIS RESOLUTION IS SO IMPORTANT. IN RECENT YEARS WE'VE SEEN THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES DISCRIMINATE AGAINST MOST OF AMERICANS. WITH THE TRAVEL BAN THE CAPTAIN WAS A PART. THREATEN TO REVOKE THE BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP THAT GUARANTEES SO MANY API'S ARE BASIC RIGHTS IN THIS COUNTRY. AND SCAPEGOAT ASIAN AMERICANS IN THE NAME OF THE CLASS BECAUSE OF THE COLD NINETEEN PANDEMIC. UNSURPRISING API'S ARE NOW IN THE MIDST OF AN ALARMING SURGE OF ANTI API HATE CRIMES. ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. USING VIOLENT ACTION OTHER OUTRAGEOUS INCIDENTS OF RACISM DIRECTED AGAINST API'S. INCLUDING MANY HERE IN CALIFORNIA. IN JANUARY EIGHTY FOUR YEAR OLD V. CHAU RUSSIA NOT POPPY A GENTLE AND NEARLY BLIND ELDERLY KIND MAN. WHICH PUSHED HIS DEATH WHILE WALKING IN SAN FRANCISCO. THE NEXT DATE JANUARY THIRTY FIRST THREE ELDERLY APRS WORST SALTED IN OAKLAND CHINATOWN DISTRICT. INCLUDING ONE ELDERLY MAN WHO SUFFERED SEVERE INJURIES. IN MY HOME DISTRICT IN ORANGE COUNTY MADE SEEN VIRAL VIDEOS OF API WOMEN BEING SCREAMED AT CALLED THE TRYING TO BURST AND TOLD TO GO BACK TO ASIA. ARE YOU MAY HAVE READ ABOUT THE C. FAMILY A CHINESE AMERICAN FAMILY THAT'S BEEN SUBJECTED TO FIVE MONTHS. OF LATE NIGHT HARASSMENT AT THEIR NEW HOME IN LADERA RANCH. ACCORDING TO THE PEW RESEARCH CENTER ABOUT 31% OF ASIAN AMERICANS HAVE SUFFERED SOME KIND OF DISCRIMINATION OR HATE SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE CALL THE NINETEEN PANDEMIC. AND ACCORDING TO A NEW REPORT RELEASED TODAY BY STOCK API HATE. NEARLY THIRTY EIGHT HUNDRED HATE INCIDENTS HAVE BEEN REPORTED AGAINST ASIAN AMERICANS SINCE THE START OF A PANDEMIC. API'S ARE BEING ACCOSTED HARASSED COUGHED ON SPIT ON ASSAULTED AND MURDERED. WE'RE FRUSTRATED WE'RE SCARED OR ANGRY AND MANY EIGHT PIECE OF PRICE FRANKLY DO NOT FEEL WELCOME IN THIS COUNTRY WE CALL HOME. AND WE'RE TIRED OF BEING ALONE IN THIS FIGHT. WE'RE TIRED OF BEING INVISIBLE. WE WANT TO BE SEEN AND HEARD AND WE NEED YOUR VOICES THE VOICES OF THE STATE LEGISLATURE HERE IN CALIFORNIA TO STAND WITH US LOUDLY AND FIRMLY. AND TELL US YOU ARE WELCOME INTERFERE AND WE HAVE YOUR BACK. BECAUSE OF ASIAN AMERICANS DON'T FEEL WELCOME AND SAFE HERE IN CALIFRNIA. THE CONNELL STATE WITH THE HIGHEST NUMBER AND HIGHEST PERCENTAGE OF API'S. THEN WHERE CAN WE FEEL SAFE AND AFFIRMED. NOW LET'S BE CLEAR API'S ARE NOT THE ONLY COMMUNITY THAT EXPERIENCE RACISM AND HATE GROUPS IN RECENT YEARS. THE ALARMING RISE OF WHITE NATIONALISM HAS COINCIDED WITH THE CONCOMITANT INCREASE IN HATE DRIVEN ATTACKS ON A NUMBER OF MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES. WE SING MUSLIMS JEWS LGBTQ COMMUNITY AFRICAN AMERICANS LATINOS AND MANY OTHERS TARGETED IN RECENT YEARS. I'M SO DEEPLY GRATEFUL TO THE LEGISLATIVE JEWISH CAUCUS LATINO LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS THE LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS AND THE LEGISLATIVE WOMEN'S CAUCUS FOR FORMALLY EXPRESSING THEIR SUPPORT FOR THE API COMMUNITY. THIS SOLIDARITY IS SO IMPORTANT BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT WE OUTNUMBER THEM. THOSE OF US WHO BELIEVE IN LOVE. BELIEVE IN UNITY BELIEVE AND PRAY SILVERCITY OUTNUMBERTHOSE OF THAT'S WHO BELIEVE IN HATE AND DIVISION AND RACISM. AND THAT IS WHY I HAVE TO SAY I AM DISAPPOINTED IN THIS BODY AND WHAT I SEE IS THE UNACCEPTABLE DELAYS IN GETTING THIS RESOLUTION PASSED. THIS RESOLUTION WITH AN INDUCED EXACTLY ONE MONTH AGO TODAY. AN IDENTICAL RESOLUTION HR TWENTY THREE WAS PASSED OUT OF THE ASSEMBLY WITHIN A COUPLE DAYS. S. UNANIMOUSLY OUT OF COMMITTEE ENJOYED BROAD BIPARTISAN SUPPORT INCLUDING BEING CO AUTHORED BY THE ASSEMBLY'S MINORITY LEADER. I AM NEW TO THIS BODY BUT I DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHY A RESOLUTION TO CONDEMN ANTI ASIAN HATE AT THIS TIME WHEN YOUR CONSTITUENTS ARE HURTING HAS BEEN SO DELAYED. WE ARE BEING TARGETED FOR ASKING FOR SOLIDARITY WERE ASKING FOR SUPPORT AND WE HAVE NOT RECEIVED A FROM THIS BODY WE ASK YOU TO BE AS ANGRY ABOUT THE HATE CRIMES THAT WE'RE EXPERIENCING. AS WE ARE.

GREAT WELL THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBER DANTE STAMP THEM ATTENTION A FIVE ASSEMBLY HAPPY CALIFORNIA NEW CAR DEALERS ASSOCIATION. HERE IN OPPOSITION AND ALL ALL OF THE VERY BRIEF WITH MY REMARKS BECAUSE- WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE AND UNDERSTAND THAT THE POLICY GOAL OF MAKING DRIVERS AWARE OF THE PRESENCE OF INTERIOR FACING CAMERAS. AND CERTAINLY HAVE NO OBJECTION TO THE UNDERLYING TEND TO OF WHAT SENATOR WHITE HOUSE HE- IS TRYING TO DO- WHAT OUR CONCERNS ARE CONCERNED IT IS THAT PERTAIN TO THE CONSUMER BY CONSUMER NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENT BUT THE ONUS IS ON THE DEALERS. WITH WITH DOUBLE PENALTIES ATTACHED AND SO THIS IS AGAIN A SORT OF A CONSUMER BY CONSUMER- BURDENS THE NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENT WHERE WE'RE HOPING TO- CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THAT SENATOR TO PERHAPS IDENTIFY SOME ALTERNATIVE WAYS IN WHICH THE CONSUMER- CAN BE NOTIFIED AND BE INFORMED. ABOUT THESE DEVICES IN THE CAR AGAIN WITHOUT TAKING THE CONSUMER BY CONSUMER APPROACH- RESPONSIBLE BY THE DEALERS FOR EXAMPLE YOU KNOW THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS MENTIONED AB TWO THIRTEEN FROM BACK IN TWO THOUSAND THREE WHICH PROVIDES THAT A MANUFACTURER OF THE NEW MOTOR VEHICLES SOLD OR LEASED IN THE STATE THAT ISEQUIPPED WITH ONE OR MORE RECORDING DEVICES. COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS THE BAND STATE RECORDERS SHALL DISCLOSE THAT FACT IN THE OWNER'S MANUAL FOR THE VEHICLE AND WHILE I'M CERTAINLY NOT- OPPOSING SORT OF ANY SORT OF ALTERNATIVE TYPE OF A NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENT HEARING COMMITTEE TODAY- WE WOULD LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THE PIPES THE POTENTIAL ALTERNATIVES- TO ENSURE THAT THE SENATOR- AND THE SPONSORS CAN ACHIEVE THE UNDERLYING INTENT WITHOUT- PUTTING THIS RESPONSIBILITY- ON THE DEALERSHIPS SO WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE. AGAIN THE SENATORS GOALS AND OBJECTIVES AND LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING. THE DISCUSSION MOVING FORWARD. THANK YOU MISS SAMPSON- ANYONE ELSE- MAN RAIDER OTHER OTHERS ON THE LAW ENOUGH. IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO HAVE OPPOSITION. YOU MAY PRESS ONE ZERO NOW FOR OPPOSITION. AND NO ONE IN OUR QUEUE FOR UP WITH THIS ALL RIGHT THANK YOU MADAM MODERATOR AND I NOTED THAT THERE WAS IF I HAVEN'T ALREADY NOTED NO ONE IN ROOM ONE TWELVE NORTH THE GALLERY- WISHING TO TESTIFY- IF THERE'S NO ONE ELSE ON THE LINE META MODERATOR WILL NOW TURN TO THE- TO THE MEMBERS. FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS- ALL RIGHT- CENTER BOARD JUST GIVE A QUESTION. GO AHEAD IF I MAY FIVE IF I COULD POSE SOME QUESTION TO- THE AUTHOR THROUGH THE CHAIR THROUGH THE CHAIR. I REMEMBER WHEN YOU AND I HAVE TRAVELED TOGETHER AND WE WERE DEALING WITH- PRIVACY MATTERS- THE AMERICAN SYSTEM THAT WAS EMERGING AND THEN FOR THE CALIFORNIA SYSTEM IS EMERGING. IN THE EUROPEAN SYSTEM THAT WAS EMERGING IN ALL THE ISSUES THAT WE'VE DEALT WITH IN THE PAST COUPLE YEARS IN THIS COMMITTEE. IT'S A TOUGH ISSUE. IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE. AND SO I THINK BRINGING THIS ISSUE UP I THINK IT'S HELPFUL. FOR US TO- TAKE A STAB AT THE NEW DIMENSIONS OF TECHNOLOGY. AND THE CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE ABOUT. HOW DATA. IS USED HOW ARE PRIVATE INFORMATION. IS COMMODITIZED AND- PUT INTO THE MARKET- FOR OTHER PEOPLE TO BENEFIT FROM I THINK THAT IS BUT THIS IS A CONCERN OF MINE- SO THIS BILL. CREATES A PROVISION FOR HAS A PROVISION THAT CREATES AN OBLIGATION TO DISCLOSE TO THE DRIVER THAT HE OR SHE IS BEING RECORDED- AND THEN YOU CAN JUST DOCTOR HAD THAT THAT IS CORRECT. WHAT THREE CHURCHES DISCLOSED THAT THE CAMERA EXIST IN THE IN THE- THE CAR- IT SO IT'S NOT EVERY TIME YOU GET IN THE CAR IT SAYS YOUR CAMERAS NOW BEEN ACTIVATED ALREADY RIGHT USUALLY WHEN ONE LINE SHUTS ONLY ONCE RIGHT OKAY SO HERE'S MY CONCERN- I LIKE THE IDEA THAT AS A CONSUMER. I AM. THAT SAYS SOMETHING. TESTING TESTING PER. BUT. THE MALES STEP AWAY FROM IT. UNFORTUNATELY CENTER BOARDS I THINK YOU HAVE TO BE ON THE MICROPHONE YEAH BUT ITS RECORDING ME VERY LOUDLY YEAH IS THAT BETTER OKAY THAT'S BETTER NOW. ARE- MY CONCERN IS THAT. THE RECORDING OF INFORMATION I LIKE THE IDEA THAT YOU WERE DISALLOWING ITS USAGE AND PURCHASE BY THIRD PARTIES I THINK THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT AS WE LOOK INTO. THE AGE OF A. I. AND CONSUMER BEHAVIOR AS WELL AS INDIVIDUALIZED BEHAVIOR THESE ARE VERY IMPORTANT THINGS THAT WE NEED TO PROTECT. YOUR UTMOST REASONABLY GIVEN THE MARKET DEMANDS AND THE WAY THAT WE'RE MOVING FORWARD. WHAT I AM CONCERNED ABOUT HERE IS. THAT THIS WOULD BE- DISCOVERABLE INFORMATION. OUR MEANING THAT IF THERE WERE ANY FENDER BENDER. OR ANY ISSUE ON WHETHER OR NOT THERE WAS- A DISTRACTION OR INATTENTIVENESS BY DRIVERS THAT THE DEFAULT POSITION OF EITHER A PLAINTIFF WORN INSURANCE COMPANY WOULD BE IMMEDIATELY TO SEE THE RECORDED INFORMATION. I DON'T THINK THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL. IS DESIGNED TO DO BUT IT COULD CREATE A BY PRODUCT THAT THIS TECHNOLOGY ARE WOULD ALLOW SO I GUESS MY QUESTION TO YOU IS. IN CONJUNCTION WITH- NOT ALLOWING THIS INFORMATION TO BE DISCLOSED TO THIRD PARTIES. WOULD YOU BE INTERESTED IN EXPLORING FOR THE PROCESS MAYBE NOT JUST THIS MOMENT BUT THROUGH THE PROCESS OF FINDING A WAY TO INCORPORATE A PROVISION THAT THIS INFORMATION IS NOT DISCOVERABLE IN A CIVIL CON CONTEXT. SO THAT WAS MY QUESTION TO ME AUTHOR RESEARCHER BY MISTER WHAT KOWSKI I MEAN I'M GOING TO HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THAT BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT WE WERE. THE HERE WE'RE FOCUSING ABOUT THE MONETIZATION STATE ADVERTISING AND USING THAT TO MAKE MONEY OFF OF THEM I A- L. IN A CIVIL ACTION WHERE THERE'S BEEN AN ACTIVITY I DON'T KNOW- I HAVE TO THINK THROUGH WHETHER THE DRIVER. KNOWING THAT THERE'S A CAMERA IN THEIR CAR WHEN THEY BOUGHT THE CAR THERE THEY AGREED THAT THAT THAT THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT THEY CAN KEEP OUT FROM THIS DISCOVERY THE INTERESTING. INTERESTING THOUGHT I'D IT'S NOT INCLUDED IN THE CAR IN THE BILL RIGHT NOW. BUT- FOLLOWED THINK ABOUT IT IF YOU THAT THAT'S ALL I MASSIVE YOU COULD BECAUSE I THINK THERE COULD BE SOME SERIOUS UNINTENDED. CONSEQUENCES BY THESE RECORDINGS THAT YOUR BILL COULD PREEMPT- AND- IN ADDRESS IT ADVANCE SO ALL I HAVE TO DO I'LL BE SUPPORTED TODAY I'M REALLY HOPEFUL THAT YOU'LL TAKE THIS UNDER ADVISEMENT AS IS. A BILL MOVES FORWARD THANK YOU. THANK YOU. SIR COVER YOUR- IS YOUR MICROPHONE UP. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I JUST WANTED TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR THIS BILL I HAD ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA THAT THIS TALK TECHNOLOGY WAS AVAILABLE AND THAT IT HAD THE POTENTIAL TO END UP IN A VEHICLE THAT I MIGHT PURCHASE IN THE IN THE FUTURE. I THINK WE ABSOLUTELY HAVE THE RIGHT TO KNOW WHEN WE'RE BEING RCORDED AND THERE'S SOME THERE'S SOME SITUATIONS WALKING INTO A BANK WALKING INTO A STATE BUILDING WHERE YOU KNOW THERE'S CAMERAS YOU KNOW THAT- YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE BEING WATCHED BUT TO BUY A CAR GET IN IT AND DRIVE IN AND FIND OUT LATER THAT. THERE HAS THERE HAVE BEEN RECORDINGS MADE OF YOU INSIDE YOUR CAR IT'S JUST KIND OF FREAKY AND SO I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR THIS BILL AND I BELIEVE THERE'S PROBABLY GOING TO BE SOME LEGAL RAMIFICATIONS THAT WE'RE GONNA NEED TO KNOW A LITTLE BIT MORE AND SO I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS THAT ARE MADE. BY THE GOOD SENATOR FROM FRESNO THAT WOULD PROBABLY NEED TO LOOK A LITTLE BIT MORE INTO WHAT CAN THE RECORDINGS IF THEY'RE IN THE VEHICLE WHAT CAN THEY BE USED FOR. BUT JUST KNOWING IS REALLY IMPORTANT INFORMATION THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU SO CARILLO ASSERT JONES IS YOUR MICROPHONE UP THERE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR YET I JUST WANTED TO KIND OF- WELL FIRST OF ALL. AGREE THAT THIS IS A PROBLEM NEEDS TO BE SOLVED I HAVE A VERY GOOD FRIEND THAT- BUT A NEW TESLA AND OWNED IT FOR THREE MONTHS BEFORE HE REALIZES THE CAMERA IN THE REAR VIEW MIRROR. AND NEVER COULD FIND OUT WHAT THE PURPOSE OF THE ACT AND STILL TODAY DOESN'T KNOW WHAT THE PURPOSE OF THAT CAMERAS BECAUSE IT DOESN'T SERVE ANY FUNCTION IN HIS CAR THAT HE KNOWS OF- SO I DO THINK WE NEED TO. LOOK AT THIS THE PROBLEM I HAVE WITH THE BILL AS IT'S WRITTEN IS PUTTING THE RESPONSIBILITY ON THE DEALERSHIPS WE HAVE PUT SO MANY DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS ON THE DEALERSHIPS- IN CALIFORNIA- AND IF THIS WAS A ONE A PROFIT BASE FOR THE DEALERSHIP I COULD SEE THE NEXUS OF PUTTING IT ON THEM BUT I DON'T THINK THAT THE DEALERS HAVE ACCESS. TO THE DATA THAT'S BEING SHOULD COULD BE SHARED. OR BE SOLD. SO I THINK THAT PUT IT ON THE- ON DEALERSHIP. I JUST GO THERE MAYBE YOU WANT TO SPEAK TO THE- CONCERNS OF THE NEW YORK TO THAT CONCERN I TAKE I'M KIND OF ST REDDING WHAT THE- NEW CAR DEALERS ASSOCIATION SAID- SO THAT'S KIND OF WHERE I'M AT I'M I'M- I LIKE THE IDEA. I'M OPPOSED TO THE BILL AS IT'S WRITTEN BECAUSE OF THE- PUTTING IT ON TO THE DEALERSHIPS BUT THERE'S ANOTHER SOLUTION. I'M CERTAINLY OPEN TO THAT CONVERSATION.
