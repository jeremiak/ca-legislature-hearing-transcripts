WITH OTHER TRIBES --

00:30:03.869 --> 00:30:08.140 region:rollup2
WE BELIEVE THAT THOSE FUNDS ARE

00:30:04.870 --> 00:30:09.808 region:rollup2
NOT GOOD TO PROVIDE THE BENEFITS

00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:12.010 region:rollup2
THEY DO TO THE SEVENTY TWO RCF

00:30:09.808 --> 00:30:13.178 region:rollup2
ELIGIBLE TRIBES --

00:30:12.010 --> 00:30:15.447 region:rollup2
IN ADDITION EVEN THOUGH THAT THE

00:30:13.178 --> 00:30:17.115 region:rollup2

00:30:15.447 --> 00:30:19.651 region:rollup2

00:30:17.115 --> 00:30:20.986 region:rollup2
PAYMENT TO THE INDIAN GAMING

00:30:19.651 --> 00:30:22.521 region:rollup2

COVER THE STATE'S REGULATORY

00:30:22.521 --> 00:30:26.258 region:rollup2
COSTS IN PROBLEM GAMBLING --

00:30:24.990 --> 00:30:27.959 region:rollup2
BUDGET LANGUAGE THIS YEAR

00:30:26.258 --> 00:30:30.028 region:rollup2
AUTHORIZES THE STATE TO REDUCE

00:30:27.959 --> 00:30:31.096 region:rollup2
OR ELIMINATE ANY OBLIGATION THE

00:30:30.028 --> 00:30:32.464 region:rollup2
TRIBE WOULD HAVE TO PAY.

00:30:31.096 --> 00:30:33.565 region:rollup2
TIME TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE

00:30:32.464 --> 00:30:34.166 region:rollup2
ARE FUNDS AVAILABLE TO TO COVER

00:30:33.565 --> 00:30:36.968 region:rollup2
THOSE COSTS SO WE BELIEVE THAT

00:30:34.166 --> 00:30:38.236 region:rollup2
--

00:30:36.968 --> 00:30:40.172 region:rollup2

00:30:43.175 --> 00:30:46.178 region:rollup2
MEETING THEIR OBJECTIVES AND IT

00:30:44.876 --> 00:30:47.846 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY REDUCES THE TRIBES

00:30:46.178 --> 00:30:48.880 region:rollup2
OBLIGATIONS SIGNIFICANTLY TO

00:30:47.846 --> 00:30:50.549 region:rollup2

THINK THAT --

00:59:28.398 --> 00:59:34.171 region:rollup2
THE BOTH FUNDS HERE AND A GOOD

00:59:32.569 --> 00:59:35.338 region:rollup2
POSITION I THINK THE COMMISSION

00:59:34.171 --> 00:59:36.940 region:rollup2
REPORTED OUT --

00:59:35.338 --> 00:59:38.375 region:rollup2

STATUS OF THE ARTS TF AND IT

00:59:38.375 --> 00:59:41.144 region:rollup2
LOOKED LIKE A BELIEVE AT THAT

00:59:39.509 --> 00:59:43.013 region:rollup2
TIME THAT THERE WOULD BE FORTY

00:59:41.144 --> 00:59:44.514 region:rollup2

00:59:43.013 --> 00:59:45.582 region:rollup2
IN EXCESS OF THE ROUGHLY EIGHTY

00:59:44.514 --> 00:59:48.051 region:rollup2
MILLION THAT WAS REQUIRED TO

00:59:48.051 --> 00:59:51.788 region:rollup2
TWO RCF ELIGIBLE TRIBES THAT.

00:59:49.719 --> 00:59:53.256 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL MONEY WOULD UP FORM

00:59:51.788 --> 00:59:54.724 region:rollup2
THE BASIS OF WHAT --

00:59:53.256 --> 00:59:56.426 region:rollup2
WOULD BE IN THAT TRIBAL NATION

00:59:54.724 --> 00:59:57.494 region:rollup2

00:59:56.426 --> 00:59:58.762 region:rollup2

01:00:00.464 --> 01:00:03.733 region:rollup2

01:00:02.199 --> 01:00:06.369 region:rollup2
THAT FUND IS IN A GOOD PLACE THE

01:00:03.733 --> 01:00:09.239 region:rollup2

EXCEEDS ITS OBLIGATIONS BY.

01:00:09.239 --> 01:00:12.109 region:rollup2

01:00:10.941 --> 01:00:14.111 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF WHERE THE FUND IS

01:00:12.109 --> 01:00:15.145 region:rollup2

WAS ROUGHLY THIRTY TWO MILLION

01:00:30.093 --> 01:00:34.698 region:rollup2
