TO PRESENT SENATE RESOLUTION FORTY FOR I RESOLUTION COMMEMORATING JUNE AS LGBT Q. PRIDE MONTH. THIS MONTH'S PRIDE CELEBRATION TAKES PLACE DURING THE FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF THE STONEWALL REBELLION. AS YOU MAY KNOW THE STONE WALL AND IS A FAMOUS ESTABLISHMENT NEW YORK CITY -- THAT WAS KNOWN FOR OPENING ITS DOORS -- TO THE MOST MARGINALIZED MEMBERS OF THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY DURING THE NINETEEN SIXTIES. WHEN VERY FEW ESTABLISHMENTS -- WOULD EVEN SERVE -- THIS COMMUNITY. THIS IS ALSO A TIME WHEN POLICE RAIDS ON DAY BARDS ON GAY BARS WE'RE NOT ONLY ROUTINE. BUT ROTH IT ENCOURAGED BY SOCIETY WHERE PEOPLE WOULD LITERALLY BE ROUNDED UP. AS THEY WERE SIMPLY ENJOYING THEMSELVES PUT INTO POLICE VEHICLES AND TAKEN AWAY IN AN EFFORT TO DESTROY THEIR LIVES THIS IS NOT THAT LONG AGO THAT THIS WAS HAPPENING. TO OUR COMMUNITY. ON JUNE TWENTY EIGHTH. NINETEEN SIXTY NINE IN THE VERY EARLY HOURS OF THE MORNING -- THE POLICE RAIDED THE STONE WALL IN -- BUT UNLIKE AT OTHER TIMES IN THE PAST OUR COMMUNITY SAID YOU KNOW WHAT. NO. NO MORE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO KEEP DOING THIS TO US. AND THE REBELS. AND THERE WAS A RIOT. A SINGLE BREAKFAST STARTED OUT RYAN SINGLE BRICK THAT WAS THROWN. THAT TRIGGERED AN UPRISING THAT STARTED A SOCIETAL REVOLUTION IN THIS COUNTRY. AND AROUND THE WORLD. THE STONEWALL REBELLION HELPED TO CATAPULT THE CONVERSATION AROUND LGBT Q. RIGHTS. WERE AT THE TIME FROM. LOCAL DEMONSTRATIONS TO A NATIONAL MOVEMENT AN INTERNATIONAL MOVEMENT. SUBSEQUENTLY THE FOLLOWING YEAR. THE FIRST PRIDE MARCHES SPRUNG UP IN LA NEW YORK. AND OF COURSE MY OWN CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO. HOWEVER WHAT FEWER PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT. I IS THAT THREE YEARS BEFORE. STONE WALL AND I'M NOT JUST SAYING THIS BECAUSE I'M A SAN FRANCISCAN THIS IS ACCURATE HISTORY. THREE YEARS BEFORE STONE WALL IN THE TENDERLOIN NEIGHBORHOOD OF SAN FRANCISCO. THERE WAS ANOTHER. POLICE RAID THAT LED TO AN UPRISING THIS WAS A COMPTON'S CAFETERIA AND THE TENDERLOIN -- A PLACE WHERE -- TRANSGENDER RESIDENTS PRIMARILY OF THE TENDERLOIN WILL GATHER MANY -- TRANS PEOPLE AND PARTICULARLY. TRANS WOMEN OF COLOR WHO WOULD GATHER. AND LIKE. THE PATRONS AT STONE WALL THEY WERE CONTINUALLY HARASSED AND ABUSE -- BY THE POLICE AND IN. NINETEEN SIXTY SIX THE POLICE RAIDED AND LIGHT THERE -- SIBLINGS IN NEW YORK CITY THEY SAID YOU KNOW WHAT NO MORE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DO THIS ANYMORE. AND THEY REBELLED -- AND THAT -- UPRISING WAS A PRECURSOR TO STONE WALL. I RECOUNT THIS HISTORY OF OUR COMMUNITY BECAUSE EVEN TODAY -- OUR COMMUNITY CONTINUES TO STRUGGLE AND THERE ARE STILL SO MANY AREAS IN THE WORLD AND EVEN IN THIS COUNTRY. WERE LGBTQ PEOPLE CANNOT LIVE THEIR AUTHENTIC LIVES. WHERE THEY ARE HARASSED ATTACKED ABUSED [inaudible] EVEN MURDERED. I KNOW HERE LATER TODAY JUST THIS MONTH THE MONTH OF JUNE.

AND THERE ARE YOU KNOW IT'S A LEARNING PROCESS FOR EVERYONE AND WE WELCOME EVERYONE -- INTO THE TENS OF SUPPORT FOR ALL INDIVIDUALS IN THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY. AND WE HAVE MORE AND MORE DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS WHO ARE EMBRACING.

THANK YOU CENTER DRAWS -- CENTER SKINNER. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT COLLEAGUES I STAND IN STRONG. ENTHUSIASTIC SUPPORT OF THIS RESOLUTION AND AS OUR COLLEAGUES WERE SPEAKING IN AS OUR SENATOR FROM SAN FRANCISCO PRESENTED THE RESOLUTION. I WAS REFLECTING ON HOW MUCH MORE. ACCEPTANCE. AND TOLERANCE AND OPENNESS OUR CULTURE AND OUR SOCIETY HAS MADE IN MY LIFETIME TOWARDS OUR LGBTQ COMMUNITY. NOT ENOUGH YET WE DON'T HAVE THE FULL EQUALITY AND CIVIL AND HUMAN RIGHTS. THAT. THE LGBT COMMUNITY DESERVES AS MUCH AS ALL OF US DESERVE WE DON'T YET HAVE THAT. BUT THE THE GROWTH IN THE CHANGE HAS BEEN VERY REMARKABLE AND JUST RELATE A FEW OF MY OBSERVATIONS. WHEN I WAS IN FIFTH GRADE? I READ A BOOK CALLED CHAMPIONS IN SPORT IN SPIRIT AND IT HAD A CHAPTER ABOUT A WOMAN NAMED ELEANOR TENANTS. TEACH TENANTS ELEANOR TEN AND IF YOU LOOK HER UP WAS ONE OF THE MOST CELEBRATED IN FAMOUS CHAMPIONSHIP TENNIS PLAYERS IN THE U. S.. AND WAS THE COACH. FOR THE OLYMPIC TENNIS PLAYERS. LITTLE MORE ALICE MARBLE LITTLE MO CONNOLLY EVEN BOBBY RIGGS SHE WAS ALSO THE COACH FOR HOLLYWOOD. AND SHE WAS ONE OF THE FIRST US WOMEN PROFESSIONAL TENNIS PLAYERS. I READ THE CHAPTER ABOUT HER AND IT TALKED ABOUT HER GROWING UP IN SAN FRANCISCO. SHE HAPPENED TO HAVE THE SAME LAST NAME AS MY FATHER'S BLOOD NAME. AND THE DESCRIPTION OF HER BROTHERS AND SISTERS WERE ALL PEOPLE I REMEMBER MY FATHER REFERENCING IS IT RELATIVES OF HIS. AND SO I WENT TO MY MOTHER I'M IN FIFTH GRADE. AND I SAID MOM. THIS WOMAN MUST BE YOUR RELATIVE SHE'S GOT HER NAME IS MY DAD'S NAME AND SHE GREW UP IN SAN FRANCISCO AND IT REFERENCES ALL OF THESE OTHER PEOPLE THAT DAD TALKS ABOUT. SOME TALK ABOUT HER MY MOTHER SAID. I SOME WHAT WHY WHAT SHE'S A LIFE [inaudible] AND ARE. THEN SHE SAID ASK YOUR FATHER. SO I WAITED I ASKED MY FATHER WHEN HE CAME HOME HE GOES. JESUS TAUGHT AS A TWO DOLLAR BILL. AND I SAID DAD IN COURSE INQUISITIVE CHILDREN I WOULDN'T LET UP I KEPT ASKING AND KEPT ASKING. AND THEN FINALLY JUST SAID SHE'S QUEER. OF COURSE IT FIFTH GRADE I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANT WELL. MY FATHER AND HIS FAMILY. WOULD NOT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH HER. BECAUSE SHE WAS. OUT AS ONE CAN BE IN THOSE DAYS. AND I NEVER MET HER. I THEN STUMBLED UPON HER OBITUARY. IN THE SEVENTIES AND IT INDICATED THAT SHE DIED WITH NO LIVING RELATIVES. I'M ALIVE. MY FATHER WAS ALIVE. SO FROM THAT POINT ON I WAS CLEAR. THAT THIS IS WRONG. AND THAT I WAS DENIED EVER GETTING TO MEET. MY GREAT AUNT. WHO HAD SUCH A HUGE INFLUENCE IN OUR CULTURALLY IN THE SPORTS WORLD? SO THEN AS I GREW AND MY OWN DAUGHTER [inaudible] IS GAY. CAME OUT VERY EARLY. AS A FRESHMAN IN HIGH SCHOOL. AND WE LIVED IN IT WHAT I THOUGHT WAS A VERY TOLERANT COMMUNITY -- MANY OF OUR FRIENDS WERE GAYS AND LESBIANS WHO ALSO HAD CHILDREN WHICH THAT MY DAUGHTER GREW UP WITH. AND YET MY DAUGHTER SUFFERED A SERIOUS DEPRESSION IN HIGH SCHOOL. AND FRIENDS OF HERS WHO ARE ALSO GAY WHO WHEN THEY WERE LITTLE AND GREW UP WITH HER SEEM PERFECTLY HEALTHY WELL ADJUSTED KIDS. THEN BECAME CUTTERS. AND TOOK OTHER VERY SUS SELF DESTRUCTIVE ACTIVITY AND I WOULD. AND THEY WOULDN'T TALK TO THEIR PARENTS. AND THEY WOULD BE OVER AND AT OUR HOUSE AND I WOULD TALK TO WHAT'S GOING ON IN. AND THEY WOULD BASICALLY START TO CAN TALK ABOUT. YOU KNOW WE CAN'T I CAN'T WALK AROUND AND HOLD MY HAND OF THE PERSON THAT THEY HAD TO CRUSH ON IN ALL WE SEE ALL DAY IN THE HALLWAYS AT THE DANCES ALL THE OTHER KIDS. THERE THEY CAN EXPRESS THEIR AFFECTION FOR EVERYBODY THEY HAVE A CRUSH ON AND WE CAN'T AND WERE AFRAID TO SAY WHO WE AR. AND I WAS SO BLOWN AWAY THAT EVEN IN A COMMUNITY LIKE BERKELEY THESE KIDS BELTS. INTIMIDATED AND SCARED. SO THEN IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT WHEN I GOT ELECTED TO THE ASSEMBLY. THE SAME DAY I'M CELEBRATING MY ELECTION CALIFORNIANS DENY GAY MARRIAGE AND I REALIZE THAT THEY JUST DENIED MY DAUGHTER'S ABILITY. TO MARY THE PERSON THAT SHE LEFT AND I BECAME A CRUSADER. AND WHEN ON THE FLOOR OF THE ASSEMBLY WHEN WE ELECTED THE FIRST OUT. GAY SPEAKER THERE WERE SOME COLLEAGUES WHO LEFT THE ROOM. NOW MANY OF THOSE THINGS HAVE CHANGED WE HAVE MANY LESS OF OUR ADOLESCENTS WHO ARE CUTTING THEMSELVES BECAUSE THEY ARE GAY STILL SON [inaudible] WE HAVE. MANY MANY MORE PEOPLE OUT AND WE HAVE GAY MARRIAGE NOT ONLY IN CALIFORNIA BUT ACROSS THE COUNTRY. SO WE HAVE COME A GREAT LONG WAY. BUT WE HAVE FURTHER TO GO AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE CELEBRATIONS LIKE TODAY AND WE HAVE RESOLUTIONS LIKE TODAY AND I STRONGLY STAND IN SUPPORT. AND I HOPE THAT EVERY SINGLE. OPPRESSION THAT STILL EXISTS IN EVERY SINGLE PERSON THAT IS LGBT Q. THAT FEELS IN ANY WAY INTIMIDATED SCARED TO BE OUT OR PRESSED. THAT BY THE TIME MY LIFE IS OVER THAT IS FULLY ENDED THANK YOU.

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR -- THANK YOU TO THE SENATOR FROM LOS ANGELES AS WELL FOR ALL YOU WORK ON THE BUDGET COMMITTEE -- I STAND. TO OF SUPPORT THIS BILL HOWEVER I MUST RAISE ISSUES OF GREAT CONCERN. THERE ARE MANY GREAT THINGS THAT ARE COVERED HERE. BUT THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT ARE NOT. IN PARTICULAR THE COVERAGE OF UNDOCUMENTED SENIORS. THIS BODY SUPPORTED. THE BILL THAT WOULD INCLUDE. SENIORS AS FAR AS THE MEDI CAL EXPANSION. SOME PEOPLE TRULY AGREE THAT HEALTHCARE IS A HUMAN RIGHT. BUT WE HAVE MISSED AN OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE FAIRNESS AND INCLUSION BY NOT. HAVING ALL ADULTS LOW INCOME ESPECIALLY SENIORS INCLUDED. THERE IT THIS IS A VERY SMALL GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS THIRTY EIGHT THOUSAND UNDOCUMENTED SENIORS. THEY'VE LIVED HERE MANY FOR DECADES SUPPORTING CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY AND YET THEY CONTINUE TO BE LOCKED OUT OF HEALTH CARE AT A TIME WHEN THEY NEED IT THE MOST. AS SENIORS. IT IS A SHAME THAT WE COULDN'T COVER THIS SMALL POPULATION. THERE ARE ONLY THIRTY EIGHT THOUSAND OUT OF THREE MILLION UNINSURED. OUR COMMUNITIES WILL CONTINUE TO FIGHT FOR UNTIL WE WIN. COVERAGE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS WHO WORK AND LIVE IN OUR STATE. OUR SENIORS IN OUR COMMUNITIES CANNOT AFFORD. ANY MORE DELAYS FOR HEALTH CARE COVERAGE. EVERY DAY WE WAIT MEANS MORE EXPENSE OF EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS. AND SHORTER LIVES FOR THE PEOPLE WHO DESERVE DIGNITY IN THEIR OLD AGE. I SEE THE TASK FORCE AS MERELY PUTTING OFF WHAT WE KNOW IS A REALITY TODAY. THAT THEY SHOULD BE INCLUDED JUST LIKE OTHERS ARE INCLUDED. A SENIOR AS AND AS LOW INCOME IN THE STATE. WE KNOW WHY ALL CALIFORNIANS SHOULD BE COVERED WE KNOW HOW TO DO IT. AND I HOPE AND THAT THIS COMMISSION.
