TODAY'S OPENING REMARKS IF I CAN IN SPANISH AND THEN TO BE INTENTIONAL IN DOING IT- BECAUSE I THINK IT'S- IMPORTANT FOR US TO RECOGNIZE THAT WE ALL DON'T COME FROM THE SAME PLACE. LATELINE THURMAN THE CALIFORNIA THE PHOENIX AT THE LOS LAS PERSONAS CON THIS COPY SEE THAT IS THAT THIS OUT- YOU'LL TEN IN LOS MEANS MOST THAT INTRINSICALLY GODLESS QUE OTRAS PERSONAS. AL MISMO TIEMPO NO TOLD US LAS PERSONAS CON THIS GOT BC THAT IS BEING IN THE ARMY'S MULU LOUD AUTONOMA MEANS MOST OPPORTUNITY. THAT IS OLD RECORDS TRUCKS- MOBILE THEM MOST GEARED UP ALONG. FOR US TO GO TO A EAGLE DIE. ON THE Y. IT A SCHOOL RUN HE THEY LINGUAE. L. MODEL THEY PROMOTE TAUGHT US ASSEMBLY BLEND COMMUNE SUCK. BETTER WAS TO FREEZE HIM. THE FROM AN ACTIVE K. HAS TO FIND THAT ALL PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES HAVE THE SAME LEGAL RIGHTS AS OTHER PEOPLE. AND YET AT THE SAME TIME NOT ALL PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES COME FROM THE SAME PLACE AND HAVE THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES AND RESOURCES. HOW CAN WE CONTINUE TO ADVOCATE FOR EQUALITY WHEN THERE ARE CULTURAL AND LANGUAGE BARRIERS. THE PROMOTE TOTEM MODEL IS A GOOD START BUT IS THAT ENOUGH. THAT THEME OF IS THAT ENOUGH IS IMPORTANT FOR US TO ADDRESS AS WE ARE ALSO LOOKING AT DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES AND THE COPA NINETEEN PANDEMIC. I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE FRAMING COMMENTS TODAY INSIST THAT WE HAVE A PUBLIC FACING THE DASHBOARD ON VACCINE ACCESS SPECIFICALLY FOR DISABILITY COMMUNITY. I'D ALSO LIKE TO TODAY MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE FLEXIBILITY AS CODIFIED IN EXTENDED BEYOND THE MONTH TO MONTH THAT CURRENTLY IS HAPPENING. AND I'D LIKE US TO ADDRESS DIRECTLY THE SUSPENSION LANGUAGE. THAT TREATS POLICIES THAT ARE FUNDAMENTALLY. FUNDAMENTALLY ON GOING AND NATURE AS IF THEY ARE TEMPORARY. I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT PART FOR US TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CORRECT DURING THIS HEARING WANTED TO START TODAY BY FRAMING THOSE COMMENTS SO THAT WE COULD HEAR THAT. THE WITH THAT WE WILL BEGIN OUR FIRST PANEL. FOR THE PANELISTS WHO WILL BE PRESENTING YOUR ORDER OF THE TO ME YOU WILL PRESENT IN THE ORDER THAT YOUR NAME APPEAR IN THE AGENDA.

FOR THIS FIRST PANELIST WE HAVE EIGHT PRESENTERS AND WE WILL START WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES DIRECTOR NANCY PARCHMENT. WE WILL HOLD ALL MEMBERS QUESTIONS UNTIL AFTER ALL OF THE PANELISTS HAVE CONCLUDED. AND WITH THAT CAN WE PLEASE BEGAN WITH ISSUE ONE. THANK YOU DR ARAMBULA AND- THANK YOU COMMITTEE MEMBERS I ALSO WANT TO- EXPRESSED GRATITUDE TO- STAFF FOR A COMPREHENSIVE AGENDA THAT IS- FRAMING OUR CONVERSATIONS TODAY. I'M AS NOTED I HAD- A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS I'VE BEEN ASKED TO RESPOND TO- SO WITH- STARTING ON ON THE FIRST COUPLE OF QUESTIONS I DO WANT TO. ESTABLISH A LITTLE BIT ABOUT FRAMEWORK AND STAGE FOR WHERE WE ARE IN ON THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE TESTED POSITIVE IN PASSED AWAY. TO KOBE WHILE MR SEVEN CASH WHO IS OUR CHIEF DATA ANALYTICS AND STRATEGY- DEPUTY THAT IS GOING TO FOCUS ON ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AND IN THE NEXT SET OF QUESTIONS- AS OF FEBRUARY NINTH WE HAD- 1-300-040-0403 INDIVIDUALS SERVED BY REGIONAL CENTERS WHO TESTED POSITIVE FOR CARPET. AND SADLY WE HAD FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY ONE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE TESTED POSITIVE HAVE PASSED AWAY. 69% OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS WERE POSITIVE WERE REPORTED ON OR AFTER. DECEMBER FIRST 59% OF THOSE WHO HAVE PASSED WERE REPORTED ON OR AFTER DECEMBER FIRST SO YOU CAN SEE THE RECENT SURGE REALLY HAD A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT. YOU ARE INDIVIDUALS THAT WE SERVE- THROUGH THE REGIONAL CENTERS THE SAFETY OF OUR CONSUMERS AND FAMILY MEMBERS PROVIDERS OR STAFF REGIONAL CENTERS AND YOUR DDS DOWN IN THE PRIMARY FOCUS. AND I WILL SAY THAT IN YOUR REPORT OBJECTIVE ARE CONSUMER OR THOSE WHO SUPPORT THEM- IS DEEPLY SADDENED AND IT HURTS- AND WE ALWAYS SEND OUR DEEPEST CONSOLE IS TO. TO THOSE WHO HAVE LOST THEIR LOVED ONES BUT IT'S BEEN VERY IMPORTANT INFORMATIVE FOR US TO BE ABLE TO HAVE DAILY TRACKING OF THOSE WHO- WHO ARE POSITIVE WHO WERE IN THE HOSPITAL AND THOSE WHO HAVE PASSED SO WE CAN MAKE THE BEST DECISIONS AND HAVE IT. IN OUR ACTION AND REACTION- ON TO THIS VERY SERIOUS PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS. GOING BACK TO MARCH IN BEGINNING WITH A STAY AT HOME ORDERS- MY FOCUS FOR A RESPONSE I'M TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY HAS BEEN VERY FOCUSED ON SAFETY FOR CONSUMERS PROVIDERS AND STAFF. AND THIS HAS BEEN ACHIEVED THROUGH FOCUSING ON FLEXIBILITY COMMUNICATION TO AND FROM OUR COMMUNITY SUPPORT TO OUR PROVIDERS THEIR STAFF AND THEN ALSO ON DATA SAID NOTED. UNDER NUMBER OF DIRECTION- DIRECTIVES THAT WERE ISSUED TO BE RESPONSIVE AND TO BE ABLE TO PLAY A ROLE IN MAKING SURE THAT WE ACHIEVE THESE KIND OF CORE TENETS AND OUR RESPONSE. THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT TYPES OF DIRECTIVES THAT WERE ISSUED UNDER TWO DIFFERENT- ORTIZ. THE FIRST BEING UNDER THE EXECUTIVE ORDER. WHICH PROVIDES ME AS A DIRECTOR ON THE ABILITY TO ISSUE THESE DIRECTIVES IN THIRTY DAY INCREMENTS. AND THE SECOND IS UNDER AND HEALTH AND SAFETY AUTHORITY WHICH IS IN A PROVISION IN THE LAW THAT GIVES THE DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES. THE ABILITY TO ISSUE DIRECTIVES TO PROTECT THE CONSUMERS- RIGHT. HEALTH SAFETY OR WELFARE. THAT HELP INCREASE- RUBBISH DOES NOT HAVE A THIRTY- TIME TO. I WAS MARCH TWO DDO IS ISSUE APPROX FORTY DIFFERENT. GUIDANCE IN FOR. LETTER PRIMARILY WE HAVE- ON THE OF A- IN WHICH WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE ACHIEVING US I HAD NO TO IT. ADDITIONALLY EQUITY AND SERVICES AND INTERVENTIONS YOU ARE COMMUNITIES YOUR GREATER STRESS ONLY BY HEALTH BUT ALSO BASED ON ETHNICITY OR BASED ON GEOGRAPHIC OR ECONOMIC- STATUS IN IN NEEDING TO ACCESS RESOURCES TO KEEP THEM SAFE. I'VE BEEN ASKING- TALK ABOUT STATE DIRECTIVES THAT HAVE BEEN- ESTABLISHED IN BORN THROUGH THE AUTHORITY PROVIDED THE EXECUTIVE ORDER BUT I'M ALSO STATE AND ALSO THOSE- DIRECTIVES AS I NOTED UNDER THE HEALTH AND SAFETY MAY ALSO BE PART OF THE DISCUSSION. THAT WE MAY HAVE- WE TAKE A LOOK AT THOSE- ORDERS THAT WE HAVE ALSO HEARD FROM OUR STAKEHOLDERS PRIORITIES BECAUSE WE'VE HAD SEVERAL DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS WE'VE HAD STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT ASK. WHAT'S WORKING WHAT'S NOT WORKING WHAT ARE THE THINGS THAT YOU WOULD MAKE PER RECOMMENDATION IF WE NEEDED TO PAY RENT AND DO THINGS-DIFFERENTLY. STAKEHOLDERS AND SHARED WITH US THERE'S BEEN A NUMBER OF THE PRIORITIES AND THE DIRECTIVES THAT THEY HAVE FOUND TO BE VERY HELPFUL. PARTICIPATE DIRECTED SERVICES WHILE IT HASN'T BEEN UTILIZED AS MUCH AS WE WOULD LIKE AND WE HAD TO DO ADDITIONAL TRAINING AND OUTREACH IN THIS AREA. BUT THERE HAS BEEN A REQUEST TO BE ABLE TO EXTEND THOSE THREE SERVICE CALLS THAT WE ADDED UNDER DISCOUNT ON THAT. SERVICE CODES ARE FOR INDEPENDENT LIVING- SERVICES SUPPORTED EMPLOYMENT AND PERSONAL ASSISTANCE WE ALSO HEARD THAT REMOTE SERVICES POST FOR THE REGIONAL CENTERS DOING OUTREACH AS SERVICE COORDINATION BEING ABLE TO DO AND TAKE. AN ELIGIBILITY I'M REMOTELY AND ALSO FOR SERVICE PROVIDERS PARTICULARLY AND EARLY INTERVENTION- BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE SERVICES REMOTELY HAS ALSO BEEN AN AREA IN WHICH- OUR COMMUNITY HAS EXPRESSED STRONG. DESIRE TO BE ABLE TO EXTEND THAT ON A LONGER TERM BASIS. ADDITIONALLY THERE IS NONE I'M INTEREST IN AND UNDERSTANDING WHAT THE IMPACT BECAUSE ALL TALKING A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE DECLINE IN OUR EARLY START- CASELOAD- BUT IN ADDITION WE ARE ALSO VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THAT WARM HANDOFF FROM EARLY START GOING TO EDUCATION. AT THE AGE OF THREE SO ONE OF THE DIRECTORS ALSO HAD- IDENTIFIED REGIONAL CENTERS TO EXPAND SERVICES AND TELL AN INDIVIDUAL THAT CHILD HAS BEEN ABLE TO HAVE- SERVICES IDENTIFIED THROUGH EDUCATION BEFORE THEY- WOULD GET ON EITHER HAVE. THE INDIVIDUAL- NO LONGER L. ELIGIBLE REGIONAL CENTER SIR. OR IF THEY ARE L. L. FOR GOING. STAKEHOLDERS HAVE ALSO IT AND ABOUT THE THIRTY RENEWAL PROCESS AND THE TIME LIMIT- EARLY ON YOU KNOW WE CERTAINLY HAS AN APARTMENT HAD SOME STRUGGLES AND BEING ABLE TO BE TIMELY AND BE ABLE TO PUSH THOSE OUT- AND THERE IS SOME UNCERTAINTY FROM OUR COMMUNITY WE CERTAINLY HAVE. TAKEN THAT VERY SERIOUSLY WE'VE ADJUSTED OUR PROCESS AND ARE ABLE TO- HAVE APPROVALS FOR THOSE DIRECTIVES TO BE OUT TIMELY SO THERE'S- NOT A QUESTION WHAT WE'RE GOING TO BE DOING FROM MONTH TO MONTH- ADDITIONALLY IT IS REALLY OUR INTENT TO CONTINUE THE EXTENSION OF ANY NEEDED DIRECTIVE TO ENSURE THE STATE AND- SAY SERVICES- AND SUPPORTS TO INDIVIDUALS TO KEEP THEM- SAFE AND RECEIVING THOSE SERVICES DURING THIS TIME. TODAY WE'VE ONLY ENDED FOR THOSE DIRECTIVES- AND I DO WANT TO MAKE NOTES THAT TIME BASED ON THE FEEDBACK THAT WE HAVE HEARD FROM OUR STAKEHOLDERS- THAT WE ACTUALLY ARE MOVING FORWARD WITH REGULATIONS- WE ARE WORKING ON A DRAFT RIGHT NOW FOR PARTICIPANT DIRECTED TO EXTEND IT TO THOSE THREE DIFFERENT SERVICES. AND AGAIN THAT'S INDEPENDENT LIVING SKILLS- IT IS SUPPORTED EMPLOYMENT AND PERSONAL ASSISTANCE WE ANTICIPATE BEING ABLE TO HAVE A DRAFT OF THOSE REGULATIONS POSTED- BY EARLY OR MID SPRING- IT DEFINITELY A REMOTE SERVER- WE- CURRENTLY. EXPLORING UNDER OUR AUTHORITY WITH THE FEDERAL WAIVER ON BECAUSE WE DO BELIEVE THAT WE MAY HAVE SOME- OPPORTUNITIES WITHIN OUR EXISTING WAIVER TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE REMOTE SERVICES FOR WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES ON THIS. SO WE CAN BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT IS- CURRENTLY IN OUR THIRTY WORK WE NEED TO START EXPLORING WHAT ARE THE OPPORTUNITIES EITHER THROUGH WAIVER- AND EXTENDING- THE- VARIOUS WAYS OF BEING ABLE TO REACH FAMILIES AND CONSUMERS. NOT ONLY IN AN EMERGENCY BUT EVEN TO ACCOMMODATE SOME UNIQUE SCHEDULE SOMETIMES FAMILY SPACE AND JUST A DAILY LIFE. SO AGAIN OUR DIRECTIVES- CENTERED AROUND- SAFETY REMOTE OPTIONS WE ALSO HAD VERY SPECIFIC% FLEXIBILITIES TO SUPPORT SERVICE PROVIDERS TO MAKE SURE. THAT WE WERE BEING RESPONSIVE TO SOME OF THOSE UNIQUE AND CHALLENGES- SUPPORTER LIVING PROVIDERS HAD EXPRESSED- CERTAINLY EARLY ON DEFINITELY MADE WAY OF SAYING IT'S BEEN VERY DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO SUPPORT THEIR STAFF AND TO BE ABLE TO BE RESPONSIBLE. SO ONE OF OUR MORE RECENT- DIRECTIVES WAS TO ALLOW FOR AND ESTABLISH A TWENTY FOR HOUR RATE FOR OUR SUPPORTED LIVING PROVIDER SO THEY COULD HAVE SOME FLEXIBILITY. ADDITIONALLY FOR FAMILIES AND CONSUMERS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU KNOW WHEN WE HEARD FROM OUR FAMILIES THAT WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO HAVE MORE THAN ONE PERSON IN. THAT THEY REALLY NEEDED TO HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY ON THE RATE TO SUPPORT OVER TIME- THIS IS PARTICULARLY A VOICE THAT CAME FROM OUR DIVERSE COMMUNITY THAT SAID. YOU KNOW WE REALLY DO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE SUPPORTING OUR LOVED ONES ARE FAMILY MEMBERS YOU WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE SUPPORTED- THEIR CONCERNS AND THAT WAS ONE OF THE ADDITIONAL RESPECT YOUR ACTIVES THAT WE'RE ABLE TO PROVIDE. FLEXIBILITY TO REGIONAL CENTERS WE ARE- RECOGNIZING THAT THEY HAVE BEEN WORKING. VERY HARD SAME AS THAT FAMILIES AND SAME WITH THE- SERVICE PROVIDERS- SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAD THE OF. DUE TO THE FACT TO DO GALLERY. I WAS ASKED TO ALSO ADDRESS AND HER AID. AND UPDATE ON THIS MOST RECENT AND APPROACH ON VACCINE STRATEGIES. AND VERY SPECIFICALLY TO THE REGIONAL CENTER CONSUMER POPULATION AND THEN- ALSO TO IDENTIFY ANY CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE VACCINE ACCESS OR- OUR POPULATION AND I'M GONNA GO AHEAD AND PROVIDE SOME OF THAT INFORMATION TO YOU- AND NOW. I'M CALIFORNIA'S VACCINE PLAN WAS ISSUED IN DECEMBER TWENTY TWENTY- AS A PHASE ONE AA- FOR VACCINE PRIORITY- THERE TO KIND OF MAIN AREAS RESIDENTS OF LONG TERM CARE AND THAT HEALTH CARE WORKERS- WE AS A DEPARTMENT- WE HAD HEARD FROM OUR COMMUNITY YOU KNOW REALLY WANTING SOME CLARITY AS TO. WHO IS DEFINED AS A- RESIDENT AND LONG TERM CARE AND THEN WHO ARE THE INDIVIDUALS WHO WOULD QUALIFY AS HEALTHCARE WORKERS AND SO WE ISSUED WE WORK WITH CDPH- AND REALLY LOOKED OUT HOW CAN WE FURTHER DEFINED NOT- SO IT WOULD BE- AVAILABLE TO. THOSE WHO ARE SUPPORTING INDIVIDUALS NOT ONLY THOSE WHO HAVE HIT SOME PARTS- BUT ALSO FAMILY MEMBERS WHO ARE UNPAID YOU KNOW BUT THEY PROVIDE GIVEN PROVIDING SUPPORTS YOU- THEIR LOVED ONE WHETHER IT'S A SON DAUGHTER BROTHER SISTER. I'M AT HOME BECAUSE THEY'VE NOT BEEN ABLE TO HAVE THE OTHER SUPPORT- WE WERE ABLE TO ISSUE- CLARITY ON THIS. I'M IN JAN- AND SO THAT'S FAIRLY. THAT WE WERE ABLE TO GET THE ADDITIONAL CLARIFICATION AS TO- THOSE SETTING TYPES AS WELL AS MAKING SURE THAT- WHAT VENDORS AND WENT UNPAID SUPPORT- WOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR HEALTH CARE. THERE WAS SOME CONFUSION AT LOCAL LEVELS I'M PARTICULARLY AND A COUPLE OF COUNTIES- WE'RE NOT ACCEPTING LETTERS FROM FAMILY MEMBERS THIS WAS VERY CONCERNING TO US- AND CERTAINLY WANTED TO SEE WHAT WAS THE REMEDY TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THAT. WE ARE ABLE TO WORK WITH CDPH THEY THEN ISSUED A CLARIFYING FAQ- THAT WAS ABLE TO- ADDRESS THAT ISSUE AND WE DID RECEIVE- ALMOST THAT SAME DAY-FAMILIES- PROVIDING US FEEDBACK SAYING THAT THAT. ADDED SOME CLARITY AND WE WERE ABLE TO- SEE SOME SUCCESS WITH THAT FURTHER CLARIFICATION. PHASE ONE B. END OF SIXTY FIVE AND OLDER- THIS DOES TOUCH SOME OF THE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE- INTELLECTUAL DEVELOP THE DISABILITIES- WE RIGHT NOW HAVE A TEN THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR REGIONAL CENTER CONSUMERS WHO ARE SIXTY FIVE AND OLDER- NOW PART OF. THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO LIVE IN LONG TERM CARE WERE ELIGIBLE FOR THE VACCINE- IN THE FIRST- FACED IN THE FIRST PRIORITY GROUP- 44% OF THEM HOWEVER LIVE IN THEIR OWN HOME- OR WITH FAMILY MEMBERS AND SO THOSE ARE THE INDIVIDUALS THAT WE HAVE- PROVIDED A DIRECTED TO REGIONAL CENTERS THAT THEY MUST. GO OUT AND MAKE- FOCUS CONVERSATIONS AND- OUTREACH TO THOSE INDIVIDUALS TO HAVE INSURANCE THAT THEY KNOW HOW TO. REGISTER HOW TO ESTABLISH A CONNECTION TO THE VACCINE AND MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S A WAY FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO GET THE VACCINE AND THEY ARE- AND UNDERSTAND WHAT OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE TO THEM. I'M ADDITIONALLY- FOR THE PRIORITIES AS WE HAVE HEARD- AS OF FRIDAY- THAT WE HAVE THE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE HIGH RISK- CERTAINLY OUR POPULATION WITH DEVELOP DISABILITIES HAD FITS INTO THESE CATEGORIES AND I'LL JUST REVIEW THAT FOR THOSE WHO. MAY NOT HAVE THAT INFORMATION THAT HOWEVER IS EFFECTIVE ON MARCH FIFTEENTH. SO INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE SIXTEEN TO SIXTY FOUR WHO ARE DEEMED TO BE- BY THEIR HEALTH CARE PROVIDER TO BE AT A VERY HIGH RISK- FOR MORBIDITY OR MORTALITY- AND FROM KOBE NINETEEN AS A DIRECT RESULT OF ONE. ONE OR MORE A VERY SPECIFIC SEVERE HEALTH CONDITIONS INCLUDED IN THOSE HEALTH CONDITIONS ARE INDIVIDUALS WITH DOWN SYNDROME. IT IS ALSO- THERE'S- THEY JUST SAW- CLARITY IS THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO. AS A RESULT OF A DEVELOPMENTAL OR OTHER SEVERE HIGH RISK DISABILITY- THAT THE INDIVIDUALS LIKELY TO DEVELOP SEVERE LIFE THREATENING ILLNESS OR DEATH FROM CALL THE NINETEEN INSPECTION OR REQUIRING FOR THE NINETEEN WILL LIMIT THE- INDIVIDUAL'S ABILITY TO RECEIVE ONGOING CARE AND SERVICES VITAL TO THEIR WELL BEING AND SURVIVAL- OR PROVIDING ADEQUATE AND TIMELY- KOBE CARE WILL PARTICULARLY. BE CHALLENGING AS A RESULT OF THE INDIVIDUAL'S DISABILITY- I'M THE DIRECTIVE THAT- DDS SENT OUT ON FRIDAY INSTRUCTING THE REGIONAL CENTERS TO DO THE OUTREACH FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE SIXTY FIVE AND OLDER- IN ADDITION WE ARE CURRENTLY WORKING ON AND ANOTHER DIRECTOR- THAT IS GOING TO OUTLINED CLARITY. ON HOW REGIONAL CENTERS WILL BE ASKED- AND AGAIN BOTH OF THESE DIRECTORS ARE ASKED TO HAVE OUR COMMUNICATION TOGETHER AS PARTNERS- WE ALL HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE GETTING INFORMATION. THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO CONNECT WITH THEIR HEALTH PROVIDERS TO BE ABLE TO HAVE ACCESS- TO THE VACCINES WHEN THEY'RE AVAILABLE- THIS IS NOT A SURPRISE- FOR ME TO SHARE THAT ONE OF THE BIGGEST CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE IS THE AVAILABILITY AND- OF THE NUMBER OF. VACCINES THERE IS A LIMITED SUPPLY- AND THERE'S ALSO DIFFERENT IS A DIFFERENT- SUPPLY IS BETWEEN COUNTY SOME COUNTIES- ARE FURTHER ALONG IN THE PRIORITY LIST THAN OTHER COUNTIES- AND SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE ALSO HAVING THE REGIONAL CENTERS AND OUR COMMUNITY PARTNERS TRACKING. THE AVAILABILITY SO WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT INDIVIDUALS ARE OUT QUICKLY I'M TO GET THOSE- AND BAXEEN. SO IT DOES ALL- KIND OF CONCERN- THAT WE DO HAVE THAT REMAIN WHILE WE NOW KNOW WHO AND WE KNOW. WHEN WE NEED TO KNOW WE NEED TO REALLY DEFINE KIND OF THAT ACCESS IN THAT HOUSE- SO THIS REALLY WELL THE PLANS OF THE THINGS THE STEPS THAT WE'RE DOING TO GO FORWARD REALLY DO ADDRESS THE ISSUES THAT WE HAVE CONCERNS. LIKE I SAID THE AVAILABILITY OF A VACCINES IS A CONCERN WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE IDENTIFYING THOSE CONSUMERS RIGHT AWAY THAT HAVE THE GREATEST REST BASED ON THEIR HEALTH CONDITIONS SO THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE HIGHLY COMPLEX MEDICAL NEEDS- ANY INDIVIDUAL THAT IS. AND A RISK AREA AS FAR AS EVEN BEING ABLE TO GET ACCESS TO- A SITE OR WHO IS UNABLE TO GO TO A SITE- WE ALSO KNOW THAT THERE'S SOME VERY REMOTE AREAS IN CALIFORNIA THAT HAD VERY LIMITED INTERNET ACCESS. I'M SO WE WANT THE REGIONAL CENTERS TO WORK WITH- CARE PROVIDERS AND OTHERS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE DOING OUTREACH EVERY SINGLE PERSON. THAT WE DON'T LEAVE ANYBODY BEHIND- IN THE DIRECTIVE WE'VE ASKED THE REGIONAL CENTERS TO MAKE THESE CONTACTS WE KNOW THAT THEIR COORDINATORS VERY TIRED. EVEN ALSO WORKING VERY HARD ALONG WITH THE PROVIDERS AND FAMILY MEMBERS WHAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO PUSH THE GAS PEDAL- SO WE'VE ASKED THE REGIONAL CENTERS TO THINK THROUGH THEIR STAFFING TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY USE ALL THEIR STAFF THAT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE TO DO THIS I REACH. AND THEN ALSO PARTNER WITH THEIR SERVICE PROVIDERS TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT REACH SO WE CAN HAVE TIMELY AND EFFECTIVE OUTREACH TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES THAT I JUST IDENTIFIED- ON THE ADDITIONAL AREA THAT I'M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT BUSINESS INFORMATION. WE ARE STILL HEARING FROM SOME ABOUT THE FEAR. OF HAVING THE VACCINE I JUST HEARD YESTERDAY SOMEBODY WAS AFRAID TO- TAKE THE VACCINE BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO CHANGE THEIR DNA. AND SO WE NEED TO GET THE INFORMATION OUT WE ALSO NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE USING THOSE THAT ARE TRUSTED TO BE ABLE TO SHARE THE INFORMATION. WE ARE VERY. FORTUNATE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE OUR TO HE BASED ORGANISED. THAT PARTNERED WITH US THESE REALLY IMPORTANT OUR- TO COMMUTE SAID CALL. AND TO OUR UNDER CAN. AND SO WE DO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE RESOURCES TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE INFORMATION THAT IS ACCURATE SO PEOPLE CAN MAKE THE- BEST DECISION AN INFORMED DECISION WITH THE RIGHT INFORMATION. I AM SO THESE ARE THE AREAS IN WHICH WE'VE BEEN- FOCUSED ON AND THEN I CONTINUE TO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THAT'S WHERE WE'RE GOING TO PRIORITIZE IT- I DO WANT TO JUST MAKE NOTE THAT WHILE WE HAD REGIONAL CENTER CONSUMERS THAT ARE OFTEN COMMUNITY WE ALSO HAVE REGIONAL CENTER CONSUMERS THAT ARE IN OUR STATE OPERATED SERVICES. SO WE DO OPERATE- PRIMARILY TO STATE OPERATED FACILITIES- WHICH IS VERY BUTTE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER AND THEN ALSO CANYON SPRINGS BUT WE ALSO HAVE VERY CUTE. CRISIS HOMES- BUT I DO WANT TO JUST MAKE NOTE THAT AS OF FEBRUARY TWELFTH WE HAVE 65% OF OUR RESIDENTS HAVE RECEIVED THE VACCINE. AND WE HAVE 42% OF OUR STAFF WHO RECEIVED IT. NOW WE'VE ONLY HAD TWO. BIG BASICALLY TWO SERIES OF THE VACCINE- CLINICS. AND WE ARE FINDING THAT GOING TO THE THIRD CLINIC IS WHEN WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO BRING IN MORE WHO WERE- AMBER CONTINUE TO DO OUR REACH TO OUR STAFF. AND YOU ARE- RESIDENTS THAT TO HAVE THEM PARTICIPATE- I'M SURE BATES USED TO DO SO. I ALSO ASKED TO ADDRESS THE QUESTION ABOUT WHAT HAS DDS ASK REGIONAL CENTERS TO PROVIDE IMPENDING PUBLIC RELATED PLANS BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE A DIRECTIVE THAT ASKED REGIONAL CENTERS INSTRUCTED THEM TO PROVIDE A PLAN. FOR VACCINE AND PROTESTING AND SO WE PROVIDED THIRTY DAYS FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO GET TO US. ON THE NEWS ON FRIDAY IS ACTUALLY CHANGING THAT- KIND OF DIRECTED LIKELY NOT MUCH WE STILL EXPECT THAT OUT OF REACH BUT I DO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE DOING IT UNDER THE LANDS THAT WE HAD INDIVIDUALS THAT. ARE GOING TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR THE VACCINE ON MARCH FIFTEENTH. SO WE'RE GONNA WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE REGIONAL CENTERS ARE FOCUSING ON A PLAN THAT DOES COMMUNICATION IDENTIFIES THOSE CLINICS THAT THAT ARE AVAILABLE IDENTIFY WAYS TO BE ABLE TO GET ACCESS. WHETHER IT'S COORDINATING WITH RENTAL TRANSPORTATION PROVIDERS TO GET INDIVIDUALS TO A CLINIC. OR WORKING WHEN WE IDENTIFY MOBILE- OPPORTUNITIES FOR THINGS TO GO TO INDIVIDUAL HOMES BUT WE NEED TO KNOW NOW WHO THOSE INDIVIDUALS ARE. THAT ARE GOING TO NEED THAT ACCOMMODATION- I. HAVE ALSO BEEN ASKED TO. BRIEFLY OUTLINE IN THE STATE- RESPONSE REGARDING THE EDS POPULATION IN ANY MAJOR CHANGES THAT ARE GOING GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PARTICULARLY WANTED TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS ON THE THIRTY SIX POINT SEVEN MILLION INVESTMENT THAT OUTLINED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET- FOR BUDGET YEAR I'M SO FOR BUDGET YEAR TWO HUNDRED SIXTY. FIVE POINT ONE MILLION TOTAL PLAN OF WHICH IS A HUNDRED EIGHTY THREE POINT TWO MILLION AS GENERAL FUND IS- IN THE BUDGET YEAR IS RELATED TO CALL THAT RESPONSE- WE VERY SPECIFICALLY HAVE- AN ESTIMATE OF TWO HUNDRED TWENTY EIGHT POINT THREE MILLION TOTAL FUNDS AND OF WHICH IS A HUNDRED FORTY SIX POINT FOUR MILLION. REGIONAL CENTER PURCHASE A SERVICE SO THIS IS THE START OF PURCHASE A SERVICE THAT GOES TO CONSUMERS AND FAMILIES- TO SUPPORT THEIR NEEDS DURING THIS TIME- I'M OF THAT FIFTY SIX POINT ONE MILLION IS RELATED TO REST BUT MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE RESPITE RESOURCES INTO FAMILY HOMES KNOWING THAT THEY'RE STILL FAMILIES THAT HAVE CHILDREN AT HOME THEY'RE FACING NOT ONLY JUST- BE ISSUE SAID ARE NEEDED TO SUPPORT A CHILD WHO HASN'T ABOUT THE DISABILITY BUT THERE MAY BE AN HOME LEARNING THERE MAY BE OTHER FACTORS THAT ARE. ARE REALLY ADDING STRESS TO YOU ON THAT SITUATION- WE HAVE COMMUNITY HERE FACILITIES AND SUPPORT SERVICES- THAT IS ELEVEN POINT TWO MILLION WE DID SEE A DECREASE AND TRANSPORTATION SERVICES SO ON THE QUESTION RELATED TO WHAT ARE THE AREAS IN WHICH WE ARE SEEING KIND OF THOSE IMPACTS- WE DID SEE A DECREASE IN CLAIMING BY SOME OF OUR SERVICE PROVIDERS AND THERE'S A SPECIFIC QUESTION ASKING US. YOU KNOW WHAT IS THE IMPACT YOU- THOSE PROVIDERS ENOUGH AND WHEN WE GET TO THAT PORTION OF THE AGENDA WHICH I THINK IS A LITTLE BIT LATER- ALL MAKE SURE THAT WE ADDRESS THAT- ADDITIONALLY THAT THERE IS A QUESTION ABOUT WHAT FACTORS ARE INFLUENCING CASELOAD PROJECTIONS I'M THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT POINT- WE START EARLY ON A VERY QUICK. DECLINE IN OUR EARLY START AND- FOR. SERVICES BUT PRIMARILY- EARLY START. DECLINE AND- THIS MEANS THAT KIDS WHO ARE AT RISK. MAY NOT BE GETTING THE SERVICES THAT THEY NEED SO WE HAVE IDENTIFIED WAYS TO BE ABLE TO DO IMMEDIATE OUR REACH WE CONNECTED WITH ALL OF OUR EARLY START CONTACTS AND HAD. VERY FOCUSED CONVERSATIONS AND- WORKING WITH THE REGIONAL CENTERS- WE ALSO DEVELOP GROCERS WE REALLY DID- SIGNIFICANT OUTREACH WE ARE SEEING AN INCREASE IN THOSE INTAKES BUT WE- WE ARE STILL- SOMEWHAT BEHIND SO VERY SPECIFICALLY AND HOW THAT AND- INFLUENCES THE ESTIMATE THAT WE HAVE FOR BUDGET YEAR WITH CASELOAD AND REGIONAL CENTER OPERATIONS- IS. IS RELATED TO WHAT I WANT TO SHARE RIGHT NOW. SO IN CURRENT YEAR SO- THIS YEAR CASELOAD WAS UPDATED TO BE ABOUT THREE HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN THOUSAND EIGHT NINETEEN WHICH IS AND I NOT DECREASE OF WHAT WE HAD ESTIMATED. EIGHT THOUSAND FIVE THIRTY FOUR OF WHICH FIVE THOUSAND SEVEN THIRTY FIVE IS RELATED. ISSUE OUR ESTIMATE AN EARLY START. SO WE TAKE A AT OUR BYYEAR. WE ARE WE ARE ESTIMATING HIGH IN THE SENSE OF WHAT OUR TRADITIONAL ART TREND OF YEAR OVER YEAR GROWTH WITH CASELOAD. WE ARE HIGHER THAN WHAT WE'VE BEEN TRAINING TRAINING OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS- SO WE DO HAVE PROJECTED A CASELOAD OF THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY SIX. THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY ONE WHICH IS INCREASE OF JUST SLIGHTLY ABOVE TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS. ON AND WELL. WE WOULD THINK THAT FUNDING WOULD I'M ACTUALLY NOT BE WHICH WOULD BE INTERESTED IN WOULD BE ADJUSTED DOWN IN RESPONSE TO AN ADJUSTMENT TO CASELOAD- BUT WE DIDN'T DO THAT BECAUSE WHEN WE TAKE A LOOK AT REALLY- A PRIORITY TO RECOVERY IN THIS AREA. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT AS WE'RE LOOKING AT RECOVERY DURING THE PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS THAT THE REGIONAL CENTERS HAVE THE RESOURCES. TO DO THOSE AND TAKES SO IF WE WERE TO PARALLEL THE REDUCTION BASED ON THE CASE LOAD. YES WOULD THAT CHANGE REALLY THE REGIONAL CENTERS OPERATIONS- AND WANTED TO CONTINUE TO PRIORITIZE AND NOT DELAY IN TAKING AND BRINGING KIDS. IN WAS IMPORTANT AND A PRIORITY TO US- SO THAT WAS THE END OF THE QUESTIONS THAT I HAVE LISTED- AND I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU DIRECTOR PARCHMAN. NEXT WE HAVE PETE CERVENKA. HELLO GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THANKS THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT TO YOU TODAY. I'D LIKE ALSO TO THANK YOUR COMMITTEE STAFFER INCLUDING SEVERAL CHARTS AND IT JAMMED- THAT IT WILL BE USEFUL REFERENCES ARE FOR TODAY'S DISCUSSION. OF COURSE ANY CONVERSATION ABOUT DATA INVOLVES A FEW CABBIE OUT SO I. LIKE TO START WITH JUST A FEW OF THOSE. ARE I HAVE BEEN ASKING THE AGENDA TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT TRANS. WELL TRAINS ARE COUNCIL CASES AND DEATHS AND THEY CREATE TRAMLINES OVER TIME- BUT I WANT TO CALL OUT TO THE AN IMPORTANT FACTOR NOT CAPTURED BY THE TREND WOULD BE- DISCUSSION OF A RATE OF. CASES EMBRACE OF DEATH IN THE POPULATION AND- AS YOU NOTED IN YOUR INTRODUCTORY REMARKS ON OUR OUR POPULATION HAS SEEN A HIGHER RATE THAN THE GENERAL POPULATION OF BOTH. CASES AND DEATHS ON THEIR END AS WELL EXPLAINED IN A MINUTE WELL WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT OUR OUR DATA IS UNDER REPORTED AFTER REASONS- THAT THAT WILL COVER. OF COURSE. ALL ALL OF THAT- IT WAS ADDRESSED TO BUY THEIR BAR MINISTRY ABOUT THAT WAS PRIOR. OF OUR POPULAR FOR VACCINATION I GET GIVEN THE FACTORS THAT I JUST DESCRIBED. WELL THERE ARE THREE HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND OR SO CONSUMERS ARE IN OUR POPULATION JUST OVER ABOUT THREE HUNDRED OF THEM RECEIVE DIRECT CARE FOR THE STATE- WELL THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IN ADDITION TO THOSE THAT WE DIRECTLY CALIFORNIA'S HAVE DIRECT ACCESS TO DATA FOR. ABOUT 85% OF OUR POPULATION LIVES IN FAMILY HOMES ANOTHER 15% OR SO LIVE IN LICENSE RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES. ALL THIS IS IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN MIND BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY FOR THOSE WE CARE DIRECTLY FOR WE DIRECTLY HAVE ACCESS TO DATA ABOUT THEM. BUT IT'S ONLY THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE. WELL AS YOU DAHLE RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES HAVE BEEN REQUIRED TO REPORT BOTH CASES HOSPITALIZATIONS AND DEATHS AND WERE THEREFORE CONFIDENT OF THAT DATA. BUT AGAIN ONLY ABOUT 15% OF OUR TOTAL POPULATION IS IN SUCH A FACILITY- FOR FAMILIES. WELL THE LAW ONLY REQUIRES THE REPORTING OF THE GAS. AND THERE'S OFTEN AN UNDERSTANDABLE I DELAY IN REPORTING OF THAT BASS AS FAMILIES GO THROUGH THE GRIEVING PROCESS. SO FOR INFORMATION ABOUT OUR CLIENTS. OR CONSUMERS IN OUR COMMUNITY- WE OFTEN- RELY ONLY ON WHAT WE ARE. ABOUT REGIONAL CENTERS NOW OR THE SERVICE PROVIDERS NOW OR WHAT A FAMILY VOLUNTARILY REPORTS TO US- THAT'S NOT AN EXCUSE AND I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT WE MANDATE A CHANGE OR NOT BUT I DO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT IT'S AN IMPORTANT LIMITATION ON THE DEVICE. THE DATA AVAILABLE TO US. AS A RESULT OF COURSE- WE THINK THAT. WE HAVE SOME UNDER REPORTING IN OUR DATA FROM THE FAMILY HOMES AND IT'S A LARGE A CHUNK OF OUR CASELOAD. ALTHOUGH THAT UNDER REPORTING IS GENERALLY WHAT WE WOULD THINK OF THIS CONSISTENT OVER. TIME THEY CAN'T BE MEASURE- BUT IT IS THERE FOR ADEQUATE STORAGE TRY IN OUR- IT DOES OR THERE ARE. IT APPEAR THAT THE RATE OF OUR ARE HOSPITAL. MAYBE LOWER THE THEY OUT ARE AND I WAS IN AND FACTOR AS WELL IN THE PRIORITIZATION DISCUSSION FOR VACCINATION. ON ADDITIONALLY AND I'LL TALK MORE A LITTLE BIT LATER ON IN SUBSEQUENT QUESTIONS WELL IT'S IMPORTANT TO FLYING TO THAT- IN ADDITION TO OUR FAMILY IS NOT BEING REQUIRED TO REPORT CASES AND HOSPITALIZATION THERE'S NO MANDATE ACROSS OUR POPULATION TO REPORT VACCINATIONS EITHER AND SO THAT WHEN YOU COMPOUND THAT THERE'S AN INTERPLAY WHICH ALSO CONSUMER CONSENT TO VACCINATION ITSELF INTO THE DATA SHARING ASSOCIATED WITH IT WELL AND THE VARIOUS ACCESS POINTS THAT PEOPLE DO HAVE TO VACCINATION. WELL AND THE TIME WIDE POTENTIALLY IN THAT INFORMATION ALL OF THOSE THINGS HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE COMPANY OUR ABILITY TO HAVE COMPREHENSIVE DATA ABOUT WHO'S BEEN VACCINATED WELL WHERE THEY'VE BEEN VACCINATED SIDE OF. FACTS AND SO FORTH. I'M HOWEVER. WE DO THINK THAT IN THE DATA THAT WE HAVE THE TRACKING OF TRENDS REALLY ALLOWS US. TO HAVE SOME INSIGHTS INTO WHAT'S HAPPENING ON THE GROUND. AUTHOR FOR EXAMPLE THE VAST MAJORITY IN IN THE PAST COUPLE OF WEEKS OF NEW CALVET CASES ARE NOW BEING IDENTIFIED IN IN COMMUNITY I'M SORRY IN THE COMMUNITY AND FAMILY SETTINGS. RATHER THAN IN LICENSE RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES WHERE VACCINES WERE FIRST MADE AVAILABLE THIS GIVES US SOME ASSURANCE THAT VACCINATION IN FACT HAS BEEN REALLY SUCCESSFUL IN THOSE LICENSE RESIDENTIAL ASSEMBLY SO THAT'S GOOD NEWS. IT'S ALL STOP THEIR WITH CABBIE OUTS AND ACTUALLY GET TO THE TREND ANALYSIS WELL AS DIRECTOR OF ARGUMENT NOTED OR TRANSFERRED CASES HOSPITALIZATIONS AND DEATH ALMOST EXACTLY MIRROR THE OVERALL STATEWIDE TRENDS THERE TOO CHARTS IN PARTICULAR IN YOUR AGENDA WHICH PROVIDE USEFUL ILLUSTRATIONS OF THOSE CHAT- TRANS. THIRTEEN ARE PAVE SEVEN. OF YOUR AGENDA THERE THERE'S A CHART WELL THAT GOES ARE FAIRLY FAR BACK IN TIME TOWARD THE BEGINNING OF THE CALL PERIOD- WHEN WE OVERLAY THE STATEWIDE CASE TREND ON THIS CHART THERE ESSENTIALLY MIRRORS OF EACH OTHER THERE WAS A TWO MONTH BOBBLE. BEGINNING IN LATE JUNE IN THE SUMMER. AND WE SUCCESSFULLY TOGETHER BUILT BAD DOCTOR AND THEN YOU SEE THE STEEP RISE BEGINNING WITH THE THANKSGIVING HOLIDAY THAT'S NOW BEGINNING TO COME BACK TO HOME. REGARDING GAS THERE'S A GRAPH AT THE TOP OF PAGE EIGHT OF YOUR AGENDA THE DISPLAYS CHECK TRANSFER BOTH HOSPITALIZATIONS AND DEATHS AND IT'S LARGELY FOLLOW THE SAME. TREND LINES BUT- WE'RE YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY WITH LOWER OF SIX. LOWER NOW. WE WERE ASKED TO COMMENT ABOUT DEVIATIONS- AND AS I'VE SAID YOU KNOW BECAUSE WE'RE GENERALLY MIRRORING THE TREND THAT THERE ISN'T- LIVE CHECK TO MONSTER IT TO CALL OUT IN TERMS OF THE DEVIATION AGAIN I WILL FLAG THAT THERE THE RATE OF BOTH CASES AND ASK FOR OUR POPULATION IS ABOUT THREE TIMES THE OVERALL RATE OF THE GENERAL POPULATION I'M NOT OF COURSE ISN'T REVEALED IN THE TRYING TO BUT IT'S WORTH. KEEPING IN MIND. ON YOU KNOW OTHERWISE YOU KNOW THINGS THAT WE SEE OUTCOMES HAVE BEEN WORSE IN LICENSE RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES THEY'VE BEEN WORSE FOR OLDER PEOPLE THAN FOR OTHERS AND OBVIOUSLY WORSE FOR PEOPLE WITH MORE COMPLICATED UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITIONS- I DO WANT TO FLAG ON. AND SHOULD THE CHART ON PAGE EIGHT TRILLION CONTAINS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON- IT'S RIGHT BELOW THE GRAPH THAT I WAS JUST TALKING ABOUT ONE YOU WILL SEE- THAT THE- COVERED CASES OF GENERALLY ON A DEMOGRAPHIC BASIS. WHILE ON AN ETHNIC BASIS I'VE BEEN PROPORTIONAL. OUR OVERALL POPULATION THE EXCEPTION FOR THAT IS FOR WHITE CONSUMERS WERE FOR CODED CASES THEY'VE BEEN ABOUT 40% OF TOTAL CASES BUT ONLY 30% OF OUR POPULATION. WELL THIS IS- ALSO BECAUSE THEY WERE DESPERATE WHITE OR CONSUMERS ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY REPRESENTED IN RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITIES WITH THE INCIDENCE OF COLOR THAT HAS BEEN ARE HIGHER. AND FOR THE SAME REASON DEATHS OF WHITE CONSUMERS ARE 51% OF TOTAL GAS FOR THAT SAME REASON. ON. CHARTS ON PAGE NINE INTENT OF YOUR AGENDA- FURTHER ILLUSTRATES THAT- THE INCIDENCE OF THESE THINGS AND RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES HAVE HAVE BEEN HIGHER AS WELL- AGAIN AS I MENTIONED AND DIRECTOR CHRISTMAS WELL AS WE SAW VACCINATION PROGRESS IN LICENSE RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES WE SEE THAT MOST OF THE NEW CASES THAT REPRESENT US NOW IN THE DATA ARE IN FACT IN FAMILY SETTINGS- IN FACT. IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY ON JUST THE OTHER DAY THE DAILY REPORT THAT WE HAD ABOUT A HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO NEW CASES ONLY FOUR OF THEM WERE UNLICENSED RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES. ALSO THAT THAT'S A GOOD DATA POINT. MOM. DIRECTOR MARGIN ALSO TALKED ABOUT- DURING THE RECENT UPDATE TO THE STATE'S VACCINATION PRIORITIZATION AND- EXPANSION OF ELIGIBILITY BEGINNING MARCH FIFTEENTH ONE THIS IS A RECOGNITION BOTH OF THE OUR LIMITED SUPPLY OF THE VACCINE BUT ALSO- THE HIGHER RISK ASSOCIATED WITH CODE INFRACTION FOR OUR POPULATION ALSO REVEALED THAT IS A POSITIVE CHANGE BETWEEN NOW AND MARCH WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO AND WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR THE PARTNERSHIPS WITH OUR STAKEHOLDER COMMUNITIES. AND ADVOCATES WELL THERE WERE REALLY CONDUCTING WITH THEM A ROBUST ROBUST PLANNING PROCESS TO ESTABLISH A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF FOR WHERE WHEN AND HOW REMAINING POPULATION CAN. ACCESS THE BOXING. DIRECTOR BARGED ALSO TO ABOUT THE EXTENT OUT AFTER THAT SO. HAVE BEEN ASKED DO AND WE GIVE THEM A HEADS UP WE WILL ASK THEM TO DO FOR OTHER CONSUMERS AS WELL IN THE INTERVENING TIME PERIOD. ON SO WE THINK I CAUGHT A COMBINATION OF THE PLANNING TIME IN THOSE OUTREACH EFFORTS IN THE ASSISTANCE IS BEING OFFERED. WELL WILL GO A LONG WAY TO ACHIEVING OUR SHARED GOAL OF SAVING LIVES AND PROTECTING HOUSE. WE'VE BEEN ASKED TO TALK ABOUT HOW THE STATE WILL MONITOR VACCINE DISTRIBUTION TO A PERSON SERVED ON PROVIDER POPULATIONS. AND WHETHER THIS DATA WILL BE AVAILABLE AND WHAT FORMATS. EXCUSE ME THE SHORT ANSWER IS YES WE ARE MONITORING THIS DATA AS YOU SAW ON THE TABLES THAT WE ALREADY COVERED IN THE AGENDA WE TRACK TOBIN IMPACTS BY AGE BY ETHNICITY BY GENDER BY RESIDENTS TYPE IN AT THE REGIONAL CENTER LEVEL OF DETAIL THE SAME INFORMATION SUBJECT THOUGH TO THE RECORDING CABBIE OUTS THAT I PREVIOUSLY DESCRIBED IS ALSO AVAILABLE FOR VACCINATIONS. THROUGH OUR CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM- AND SO WHILE WE DON'T YET HAVE ROBUST INFORMATION- WE WILL BE COLLECTING IN THE IN THE SAME FORMAT AND MAKING IT AVAILABLE- LET ME SEE HERE WHAT ELSE CAN I COULD COVER- I DON'T WANT TO BE REDUNDANT OF PRIOR REMARKS SO APOLOGIES AS I SKIED JUMP AHEAD JUST A LITTLE BIT. ON YEAH HEY AND THEN WE'VE BEEN ASKED AS WELL TO TALK ABOUT THE INTERSECTION BETWEEN THE DDS POPULATION ON THE IHS US CASELOAD. WELL THE LAST TIME WE DID ACROSS PROGRAM ANALYSIS UP BETWEEN THESE TWO PARTICULAR PROGRAMS WAS FOR THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN CALENDAR YEAR. ON GIVEN MY LONG ASSOCIATION WITH THE IRISH OF SAAS. PROGRAM BEFORE JOINING- THE DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES- I AND WE CLARIFIED WITH IT WITHOUT DEPARTMENT AS WELL- WITH DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES. WHAT WE CAN TELL YOU THAT ROUGHLY NINETY THOUSAND OF OUR THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND CONSUMERS IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN. WERE ASSOCIATED WITH THE I. ENGINE SIZE PROGRAMS WELL THAT'S APPROXIMATELY TWENTY PERCENT. AND IT'S BEEN GROWING JUST SLIGHTLY- AFTER THAT TIME EACH YEAR AND IT'S LARGELY REFLECTIVE OF THE FACT THAT ONE OF THE GROWING COMPONENTS WITHIN THE IHS ASK IS SLOWED. IS IT IS A NUMBER OF YOUNGER CHILDREN WITH AUTISM INCREASINGLY UTILIZING IHS US SERVICES. ALSO WE THINK- THAT TREND IS PROBABLY CONTINUING ON BUT WE HAVEN'T DONE ANY EXACT MATCH THE ON THE- TWENTY EIGHTEEN CAP YOUR CALENDAR CALENDAR YEAR. DATA AFTER THAT. WELL WE'VE ASKED TO AS WELL- IT WHETHER WE KNOW HOW ARE POPULAR IN. WITH OTHER PRIORITIZE GROUP SUCH AS THOSE FIVE AND OLDER. AND WHAT REMAINING NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS HAVE YET TO BE VACCINATED. WELL BECAUSE OF THE DATA LIMITATIONS THAT I JUST DESCRIBED IT IT'S HARD TO KNOW EXACTLY HOW MANY OF THOSE CONSUMER OF OUR CONSUMERS ARE REMAIN YET TO BE VACCINATED. WELL BUT THAT IS PART OF THE REASON THAT WE DIRECTED REGIONAL CENTERS TO MAKE CONTACT WITH ELIGIBLE CONSUMERS. ON THERE ARE JUST OVER TEN THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED REGIONAL CENTER CONSUMERS WHO ARE AGE SIXTY FIVE AND OVER. THAT'S ABOUT 3% OF OUR TOTAL DDS POPULATION AND THOSE CONSUMERS ARE ELIGIBLE FOR VACCINATION NOW- I'M JUST JUST OVER- IF YOU. ARE JUST JUST OVER FIFTY SIX HUNDRED OF THEM- RESIDE IN A LICENSE RESIDENTIAL FACILITY ON THOSE- INTERMEDIATE CARE FACILITIES COMMUNITY CARE FACILITIES OR OTHER SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES SO BY NOW THAT THOSE OLDER CONSUMERS SHOULD ABOUT ACCESS TO THE VACCINE. IF THEY CONSENTED TO BE VACCINATED. ARM AND BASED ON WHAT WE SEE AGAIN AND UR TREND LINE WE THINK VACCINATION EFFORTS IN THOSE FACILITY. TYPES OF. AND THEN RELEASING IN BRINGING- DAY OF CO THAT THOSE FACILITIES I WOULD THAT A PER. ANOTHER THIRTY THOUSAND REGIONAL CONCERN CONSUMERS YOUNGER THAN SIXTY FIVE ARE ALSO A RESIDING IN THESE LICENSE RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES AND SHOULD ALSO HAVE BEEN VACCINATED SO THAT'S REALLY A CLOSER AGAIN BACK TO THE 15% OF OUR CONSUMERS. ARE THERE ARE. OWNED AND ON AS WE DISCUSSED- THE REMAINDER OF OUR CONSUMERS I SHOULD HAVE OR WITH THE REGIONAL CENTER ASSISTANCE. TENSION OF BONDS SOON WILL HAVE ACCESS TO VACCINATION. SO YOU KNOW WE THINK WE'VE MADE GOOD PROGRESS AND THERE'S ADDITIONAL SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS ABOUT. TO COMMENT ON A AND WE'RE DOING A LOT OF PLANNING IN THE RUN UP TO THE BEGINNING OF THEIR ELIGIBILITY ON MARCH FIFTEENTH. ALSO THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY I THINK I'VE ADDRESSED THE QUESTIONS ARE REQUESTED BY THE COMMITTEE AND THAT SHE WOULD CONCLUDE MY REMARKS. THANK YOU SIR NEXT WE HAVE STEVEN PAVLOV WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. BYE GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS- STEVEN POSSIBLE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THE FINANCE WAS ASKED TO RESPOND TO YOUR TO QUESTION- THE FIRST BEING WHICH GENERAL FUND INVESTMENTS FOR DDS IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. AS FINANCING DENTAL FIRES SPECIFICALLY COGNEX NINETEEN OR EQUITY RELATED. SO THE DIRECTORS ALREADY PROVIDED A DETAILED ACCOUNTING OF THE CLOVER NINETEEN RELATED INVESTMENTS I'LL JUST REITERATE THAT. TWO HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS TOTAL FUND OR A HUNDRED EIGHTY THREE POINT TWO MILLION GENERAL FUND WAS INVESTOR FOR CONTINUED RESPONSE TO COVER NINETEEN. THAT BRINGS DOWN IN THE FOLLOWING MANNER TWO HUNDRED TWENTY EIGHT POINT THREE MILLION TOTAL FUND OR A HUNDRED FORTY SIX POINT FOUR MILLION GENERAL FUND FOR REGIONAL CENTER PURCHASE OF SERVICE UTILIZATION. AND THEN THIRTY SIX POINT SEVEN MILLION GENERAL FUND FOR STATE OPERATED FACILITIES SEARCH CAPACITY. ON THE EQUITY SIDE AS NOTED IN THE AGENDA AND THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES FIVE POINT THREE MILLION TOTAL FINE OR A THREE POINT TWO MILLION GENERAL FUND FOR COMMUNITY NAVIGATORS HOW CAN WE JUST LIKE TO NOTE THIS IS IN ADDITION TO THE EXISTING LIVING MILLION GENERAL FUND. THAT'S PROVIDED ON ON GOING BASIS FOR DISPARITIES FUNDING PROVIDED TO REGIONAL CENTRES- THE COMMUNITY NAVIGATOR PROPOSAL WOULD ALLOW DDS CONTRACTOR FAMILY RESOURCE CENTERS TO IMPLEMENT A NAVIGATOR MODEL STATEWIDE. THE PURPOSE OF WHICH WOULD BE TO INCREASE SERVICE AUTHORIZATION AND EQUALIZATION AND DIVERSE COMMUNITIES. WITH THE AIM OF FURTHERING HEALTH EQUITY OF THAT THE GOVERNMENTAL SERVICES SYSTEM. THAT WOULD LIMIT COMES. THANK YOU SIR NEXT WE HAVE SONYA PADDOCK WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. GOOD AFTERNOON DOCTOR AMBULANCE MEMBERS SEND YOU PICK FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE I WAS ASKED TO COMMENT ON FOUR DIFFERENT QUESTIONS THE FIRST IS TO SHARE INSIGHTS AND PERSPECTIVES ON TRADE OFFS OF PRIORITIZING VACCINE FOR THE GDS OUR POPULATION. I WON'T SPEND LONG ON THIS SINCE- THE ADMINISTRATION HAS NOW EXPANDED TO- THE VACCINATION TO THE DDS OUR POPULATION- FOR MANY OF THE PEOPLE IN THE D. S. OUR POPULATION BEGINNING MARCH FIFTEENTH. I THINK THE QUESTIONS NOW THE QUESTION NOW WOULD REALLY BE HOW- HOW HOW THIS WILL BE HOW THIS NEW POLICY WLL BE IMPLEMENTED. STRICTER ARJUNAN- ALREADY PROVIDED A NUMBER OF- CONSIDERATIONS AND CONCERNS THERE- I WOULD JUST ADD A COUPLE- WHICH INCLUDE. BUT HOW WILL INFORMED CONSENT BE MANAGED AMONG THIS POPULATION AND WILL THE PEOPLE ADMINISTERING THE VACCINE BE SKILLED AT WORKING WITH INDIVIDUALS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. I'M MOVING TO THE SECOND QUESTION HOW DOES CALIFORNIA COMPARE TO OTHER STATES REGARDING THE VACCINE PRIORITIZATION FOR THE DDS SERVE POPULATION. I'M GOING TO PUT- FRAME THIS IN TERMS OF KEY ISSUES THAT STATES HAVE HAD TO CONSIDER SO THE FIRST QUESTION WOULD BE- WIN WIN HAS A STATE DECIDED TO EXPAND THEIR PRIORITY LIST TO INCLUDE HIGH RISK MEDICAL CONDITIONS. THE CDC RECOMMENDS INCLUDING THIS LIST IN PHASE ONE AND SEE A VACCINE- PRIORITIZATION BUT CALIFORNIA AND JUST OVER TWENTY- STATES HAVE MOVED TO THIS GROUP UP TO AN EARLIER PHASE- BUT THE NEXT KEY QUESTION IS SORT OF WHAT IS INCLUDED IN THAT LIST OF HIGH RISK MEDICAL CONDITIONS SO THE CDC'S LIST- OF HIGH RISK CONDITIONS INCLUDES DOWN SYNDROME AS STRICTER BRIDGMAN HAD MENTIONED- BUT IT DOES NOT SPECIFICALLY INCLUDE OTHER DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THIS IS REALLY A LIVING LIST OF CONDITIONS AND IT'S DEVELOPED BASED ON AVAILABLE RESEARCH SO IF A CONDITION IS NOT IN THAT LIST IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THERE IS A HIGH RISK OF SERIOUS ILLNESS FROM FROM CODED BUT- SIMPLY THAT THERE'S NOT A LOT OF RESEARCH ON. THAT PARTICULAR CONDITION IN THE COPA CONTEXT SO ONCE THE STATE HAS EXPANDED ITS PRIORITIZATION TO- INCLUDE PEOPLE WITH HIGH RISK MEDICAL CONDITIONS THE QUESTION BECOMES. DO PEOPLE UNDERSTAND- WHO IS ELIGIBLE IS THE LIST- VERY GOOD OR IS THE LIST I'M SPECIFIC SO CALIFORNIA REALLY USED ON THE CDC'S LATEST- ALMOST ALL OF THE CONDITIONS IN THE CDC'S LIST BUT ALSO EXPANDED- THE LIST TO INCLUDE DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. AND IMPORTANTLY IT ALSO ALLOWS SOME DISCRETION BY HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS- TO MAKE A DETERMINATION ABOUT WHETHER I'M AN INDIVIDUAL HAS A CONDITION THAT CAN LEAD TO SERIOUS ILLNESS FROM KOBE. I WE NOTE THAT ABOUT FIVE OTHER STATES FIVE OR SIX OTHER STATES HAVE- EXPANDED THEIR LIST OF CONDITIONS TO SPECIFICALLY INCLUDE DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. INCLUDING DELAWARE NEW YORK- ABOUT SEVEN STATES ALSO ALLOW SOME DISCRETION BY HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS INCLUDING TEXAS MONTANA NEW HAMPSHIRE. THE THIRD CONSIDERATION WOULD BE HOW ARE STATES IMPLEMENTING THE POLICY AND THAT'S REALLY- SORT OF THE PHASE THAT CALIFORNIA'S ACT. SO ONE OF THE KEY QUESTIONS IS MUST MUST INDIVIDUALS PROVIDE EVIDENCE OF THEIR CONDITION OR IS THE STATE GOING TO RELY ON SELF ATTESTATION- MOST STATES HAVE NOT INCLUDING CALIFORNIA HAVE NOT REALLY SAID HOW THIS IS GOING TO WORK. ON IT AND WE KNOW RIGHT NOW THAT SEVERAL STATES ARE RELYING ON SELF ATTESTATION. WESLEY ARE I WOULD JUST MENTION- STATES HAVE THE ABILITY TO MAKE SPECIAL EFFORTS TO ACCOMMODATE THE POPULATION I JUST PROVIDE ONE EXAMPLE- THE STATE OF OREGON- NOT ONLY INCLUDED DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES IN ITS PHASE ONE AS SO REALLY IN ITS FIRST- FIRST PHASE A VACCINE- ADMINISTRATION BUT IT ALSO. HAS DONE SOME INTERESTING THINGS LIKE CREATING A MOBILE DRIVE THROUGH AT THE PORTLAND- AIRPORT THAT ACCOMMODATES- PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. THE QUESTION WE WERE ASKED TO RESPOND TO IT CONCERNS OR OBSERVATIONS ON OTHER FISCAL POLICY DYNAMICS IN CO BID FOR WHICH WE WANT TO SUBCOMMITTEE TO BE AWARE. I'M I'M JUST GOING TO NAME A FEW EXAMPLES HERE- IN THE FIRST IS THAT THE PANDEMIC HAS REALLY HIGHLIGHTED THE NEED FOR BETTER DATA SYSTEMS IN THE- IN THE DDS SYSTEM. THIS IS REALLY BEEN A LONG STANDING L. A. RECOMMENDATION- BUT THE PANDEMIC HAS BROUGHT SOME OF THESE ISSUES- TO THE FOR INCLUDING THE FACT THAT THE SYSTEM IS HAVING TO RELY ON SORT OF A MAKE SHIFT- PROVIDER REPORTING SORT OF SYSTEM THàNH TO ENSURE THAT BILLING WILL HAPPEN- IT'S ALSO. SOMEWHAT HARD TO RUN- SORT OF REAL TIME ANALYTICS ON THE CAPACITY OF THE PROVIDER NETWORK OR ON ON WHAT- INDIVIDUALS. THE INDIVIDUAL SERVED ARE IN NEED OF- BUT ALSO MENTION IT BUT THEY- BARGE MEN HAVE ALREADY DISCUSSED- ENROLLMENT BUT THAT HAS BOTH FISCAL AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS. I'LL TALK ABOUT THE FISCAL IMPLICATIONS IN A MOMENT BUT POLICY WISE- THE DIRECTOR NOTED SOME OF THE EFFORTS THEY'VE MADE TO MITIGATE. THE EFFECTS OF DECLINING- ENROLLMENT IN THE SYSTEM. AND BUT WE WOULD JUST NOTE THAT THIS IS THE SIXTH SENSE HAS BEEN SOMEWHAT LIMITED AND- THIS CAN. THIS RAISES SOME CONCERNS IN THE SENSE THAT- DON'T WAIT OR TO SERVICES FOR DOING THAT REALLY INTERVENTION SERVICES FOR INFANTS AND TODDLERS IN PARTICULAR. CAN HAVE ADVERSE EFFECTS- ON LATER LIFE OUTCOMES AND AS WELL ON US OVERALL. COST TO THE STATE- FINALLY- JUST KNOW THAT ANOTHER QUESTION SORT OF BROUGHT INTO RELIEF BY THE PANDEMIC IS WHETHER OR NOT- INDIVIDUALS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES ARE STILL RECEIVING THE ROUTINE MEDICAL DENTAL AND MENTAL HEALTH CARE- THAT THEY OFTEN REALLY NEED. AND HOW WILL DEFERRED CARE- WE NEED TO MAYBE M. PROVIDE PROBLEMS- IN THE IN THE RECOVERY PHASE OF THE PANDEMIC. FINALLY THE LAST QUESTION WE'RE ASKED TO COMMENT ON HIS OBSERVATIONS ON CASELOAD AND BUDGETED EXPENDITURES SO THESE ARE THE FISCAL POLICY ADVOCATES AND CERTAIN FISCAL IMPLICATIONS THAT I MENTIONED BEFORE SO WE WOULD JUST NOTE THAT- V. AS DIRECTOR BARTMAN NOTED THERE HAVE BEEN SOME. ISSUES WITH AN ENROLLMENT- SINCE THE START OF THE PANDEMIC- PARTICULARLY IN EARLY START ENROLLMENT ACTUALLY DECLINED MONTH OVER MONTH- THE D. THE DDS- ASSUMPTIONS FOR THE BUDGET YEAR ARE VERY OPTIMISTIC THEY ASSUME FOR EXAMPLE OVER 20% GROWTH. IN THE EARLY START PROGRAM AND WE WOULD JUST NOTE THAT THAT DOUBLE- THE ANNUAL GROWTH OF ANY YEAR OVER THE PAST TWO DECADES ACTUALLY- SO IF THIS GROWTH DOESN'T COME TO PASS COSTS COULD BE OVERSTATED IN THE DDS BUDGET BY AS MUCH AS TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OR MORE GENERAL FUND. OUR OFFICE DOESN'T RECOMMEND DOWNWARD REVISION TO THE DDS BUDGET AT THIS TIME- WE WILL KNOW MORE ABOUT ACTUAL- CASELOAD OF ENROLLMENT AT THE MAY REVISION AND WILL ALSO KNOW MORE FROM THE ADMINISTRATION ABOUT. POSSIBLE REVISED ASSUMPTIONS AT THAT TIME AND WE CAN ADVISE THE LEGISLATURE THAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU MISS BENNET NEXT WE HAVE LISA KLEIN BOB EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE REGIONAL CENTER OF THE EAST BACK. THANK YOU DR ARAMBULA AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS- MY NAME'S LISA KLEIN ABOUT. AND I REPRESENT THE REGIONAL CENTER OF THE EAST BAY WHERE ALAMEDA AND CONTRA COSTA COUNTY- THE QUESTIONS I WAS ASKED OR WHAT ARE THE LESSONS LEARNED SO FAR. INCLUDED FOR YOUR REGIONAL CENTER CLIENTS AND FAMILIES. I WANT TO SAY THAT IN MANY WAYS THIS EXPERIENCE OF THE PANDEMIC HAS BROUGHT US BACK TO OUR ROOTS AS REALLY COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS WE'VE HAD TO. LEARN THAT. THE IMPACTS OF REALLY DEFERRED FOR PEOPLE DEPENDING ON WHERE THEY LIVE THEIR FAMILY SOCIOECONOMIC IN LANGUAGE STATUS. THEIR DISABILITY AND THEIR OWN MEDICAL NEEDS ARE RESPONSES HAVE HAD TO BE TAILORED TO ADDRESS THOSE NEEDS. THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE WE EXPERIENCE TESTING POSITIVE FOR COVERT NINETEEN. AS WELL AS THOSE WHO HAVE DIED HAVE BEEN PEOPLE LIVING IN CONGREGATE SETTINGS AND THOSE CASES WE BELIEVE HAVE ORIGINATED WITH STAFF WHO WORK MULTIPLE JOBS. IN MULTIPLE FACILITIES DUE TO ECONOMIC NECESSITY THIS HAS AGAIN RAISED THE ISSUE OF THE IMPACT OF THE LACK OF LIVABLE WAGES ESPECIALLY IN HIGH COST REGIONS SUCH AS OURS. I'M ECONOMIC CHALLENGES HAVE ALSO MEANT TO BROADCLOTH OF INCOME FOR INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES. AND WE'VE LEARNED THAT WE HAVE TO GO BACK TO OUR ROOTS OF HELPING PEOPLE TO ACCESS ALL OF THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE IN THE COMMUNITY INCLUDING FREE LUNCH PROGRAMS FOOD BANKS AND OTHER. ASSISTANCE DURING THE PANDEMIC OR HELPING HAND FUND WHICH TAKES VOLUNTARY DONATIONS FROM FELT OTHER PEOPLE OTHER ORGANIZATIONS AND FAMILIES WAS CRITICAL TO MEET THE NEEDS. FOR FOOD AND SHELTER WHEN FAMILIES HAD NO OTHER SOURCES OF FUNDS I THINK WE ALSO HAVE BEEN BROUGHT. REALLY BACK TO THE- NEED FOR COLLABORATION ACROSS OUR COUNTIES. FAMILY RESOURCE. CENTERS PROVIDERS AND OTHER IMMUNITY BASED. ARE FOR TO REACH PEOPLE OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH LOCAL COUNTIES WELL NOT PERFECT HAVE WEST LEAD TO TESTING WHEN THERE ARE. OUTBREAKS LINKING US TO ADDITIONAL PP AND ADDITIONAL WE'VE ADDITION WE'VE WORKED VERY CLOSELY WITH OUR LOCAL STATE COUNCIL AND- SHARED IN THE DISTRIBUTION. OF PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT. WE'VE ALSO LEARNED THAT THERE ARE SOME SERVICES THAT MAY BE DONE EVEN BETTER REMOTELY AND LET- LARGE LARGER AMOUNTS OF SATISFACTION AMONG FAMILIES AND INDIVIDUAL SERVICE ONE OF OUR- FAMILY CONFERENCES CONGRESO FAMILIAR ARC WHICH HAS TAKEN PLACE IN PERSON FOR MANY YEARS. MIGRATED ONLINE VERSIONS AND THAT HAS BEEN REALLY SUCCESSFUL AND FAMILIES ARE REPORTING A GREAT DEAL OF SATISFACTION WITH THAT. ON THE NEXT QUESTION IS WHAT ARE THE MAJOR CHALLENGES AND DIFFICULTIES AT THIS MOMENT I THINK VACCINATIONS. AND WE HAVE BEEN WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH BOTH OF OUR COUNTIES TO MAKE SURE THAT THE INDIVIDUALS WE SERVE THEIR FAMILIES ARE GOING TO BE GETTING VACCINES AS SOON AS IT'S POSSIBLE FOR THEM AND WE'RE REALLY REALLY GLAD. THAT THE PRIORITIZATION FOR COMMUNITY CAME LAST WEEK HOWEVER WE AS EVERYONE HAS ACKNOWLEDGED THAT PRIORITIZATION DOESN'T MEAN AVAILABILITY AND MANAGING THAT GAP INTO A VACCINE IS READILY AVAILABLE IS GOING TO BE A CHALLENGE- WE HAVE TO HELP PEOPLE ACCESS VACCINATION SITES WE WILL BE WORKING VERY HARD TO RUN LIST OF OUR MOST. NEEDY CONSUMERS IN TERMS OF THEIR CONDITIONS FOR GETTING VACCINATED BY MARCH FIFTEENTH WE ARE WORKING WITH OUR LOCAL PROVIDERS- ARE COUNTIES- LAST TWO WEEKS AGO WE HAD A CLINIC IN COLLABORATION. WITH CONTRA COSTA COUNTY FOR SIXTY FIVE AND ABOVE- CONSUME. AND THAT IN ONE OF OUR US. PROVIDERS WHO WAS VACCINE PROVIDER ADMINISTERING THE VACCINATION- BUT WE HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE AND- DIRECTOR BERTRAND DID MENTION THERE IS A LOT OF VACCINE HESITANCY AND I THINK WE HAVE TO DO BOTH- KNOWLEDGE THAT AND WORK ON WHAT THE ORIGINS OF THAT OUR AND RECOGNIZE. THAT THERE ARE REAL EXPERIENCES THAT HAVE LED TO THAT HISTORICALLY AMONG CERTAIN- GROUPS OF INDIVIDUALS. ON REGIONAL CENTERS WANT TO SUPPORT THE EMERGENCE FROM THE PANDEMICS ONE OF OUR MAJOR DIFFICULTIES MOVING FORWARD IS WE DON'T HAVE ADEQUATE CASE MANAGERS- TO- REALLY SUPPORT OUR CONSUMERS AND MEET OUR CASELOAD RATIOS. THIS HAS BEEN. AN ONGOING ISSUE AND WE REPORT ON THIS EVERY YEAR THE NEXT YEAR IS GOING TO BRING- PEOPLE WANTING CHANGES AND A- DEMAND FOR SERVICES AS PEOPLE BEGAN TO SEE THE FUTURE AND NOT FEEL AS UNCERTAIN AS THEY HAVE THIS YEAR. AND THEY WILL WANT REAL SUPPORT FROM CASE MANAGEMENT IN MAKING THESE CHANGES THE OTHER- IMPACT AND DIFFICULTY RIGHT NOW IS THAT WE'VE BEEN REALLY IMPACTED BY ALTERNATIVE SERVICE DELIVERY AND THE WAVE THERE ARE ANTIQUATED I'M FISCAL SYSTEM. DOESN'T ALLOW FOR SEAMLESS TRANSITIONS FROM ONE WAY OF BILLING TO ANOTHER AND IS REALLY COMPLEX AND HARD FOR BOTH- SERVICE PROVIDERS AND OUR STAFF. AND SO AS WE MOVE FORWARD ON THE NEXT QUESTION WAS HOW CAN THE STATE WORK TO SUPPORT REGIONAL CENTERS. AND THE DDS POPULATION IN THE COMING MONTHS I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE KEEPING ON THE RADAR THE TRANSITION TO BLUE SHIELD. AT CONTRACT FOR THAT AND MAKING SURE THAT THAT DOESN'T IT OUR POP. OF FIVE. BECAUSE BEEN DEVELOPING RELATIONSHIPS WITH COUNTIES WHO AT THIS POINT I'M NOT SURE OF WHAT THEY ARE VACCINE ALLOCATION IS GOING TO BE WITH THE NEW SYSTEM AND I JUST WANT TO KEEP OUR EYES FOCUSED ON THAT- AS WE MOVE FORWARD TO MARCH. FIFTEENTH THE OTHER THING IS CONTINUATION OF THE FLEXIBILITY- DURING THE PANDEMIC WILL BE IMPORTANT ON BOTH IN OUR ABILITY TO. PRETTY QUICKLY RESPOND TO EMERGENCIES WITH HEALTH AND SAFETY- REQUEST FROM PROVIDERS AND WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE NEXT YEAR IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE WILL THERE BE CONTINUING OUTBREAKS WE ALSO WANT FLEXIBILITIES IN TERMS OF REMOTE ACCESS OPTIONS. WHEN THIS IS PREFERRED BY INDIVIDUALS AND AGAIN THE SUPPORT FOR MORE CASE MANAGEMENT COMBAT POSITIONS AT A COMPETITIVE RATE SO WE CAN PROVIDESERVICES AS THEY SHOULD BE PROVIDED. AND JUST IN IN CLOSING ON THIS- MY PENSION AND CONCERNS AS WE EMERGE FROM THE PANDEMIC. IS I WANT TO BE SURE WE TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO KEEP THE THING SOMEPLACE. THAT WORKED AND TO REALLY BE ABLE TO ASK PEOPLE WHAT THEY WANT MOVING FORWARD WE CAN'T ASSUME AND I DON'T THINK ANYONE WANTS TO ASSUME THAT EVERYTHING IS GOING TO REFER BACK TO FEBRUARY TWENTY TWENTY. IF THAT'S REMOTE ACCESS IN FACT ACCESS TO TELE THERAPY ONGOING- WE MAY HAVE WE MAY CONTINUE THAT AND I'M HOPEFUL THAT WE'LL BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH ALL OF THE COLLABORATIONS WITH COUNTIES AND COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS. SO THAT THE PEOPLE SERVED OR SEEN AS PART. OF EVERY COMMUNITY THANK YOU. THANK YOU IN NOW WE HAVE CARLOS. EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE SAN DIEGO REGIONAL CENTER. THANK YOU DOCTOR ONLINE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THE RECORD I AM CARLOS FLORES EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF. THE SAN DIEGO REGIONAL CENTER WE SERVE SAN DIEGO AND IMPERIAL COUNTY I'M HERE MY RESPONSES TO THE COMMITTEE'S QUESTIONS. LESSONS LEARNED SO FAR IN CODE FOR OUR REGIONAL SERVICE LINES AND CLIENTS AND FAMILIES ARE THE NEED FOR CONTINUOUS CONTACT WITH CLIENTS AND FAMILIES AND THE ENTIRE DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES NETWORK. I WILL LEARN HOW TO TRANSITION STAFF TO WORK REMOTELY STAFF LEARNED MUCH ABOUT USING TECHNOLOGY TO SPEAK CONNECTED WITH CLIENTS AND FAMILIES. WILL LEARN HOW TO MOBILIZE FOR THE DISTRIBUTION OF PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT PPE SINCE MID MARCH WE HAVE COLLABORATED WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENT SERVICES THE STATE COUNCIL ON DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES AND OUR SERVICE PROVIDER COMMUNITY. TO DISTRIBUTE MORE THAN FIVE POINT TWO MILLION ARTICLES OF PPP TO CLIENTS FAMILY MEMBERS AND. SERVICE PROVIDERS STAFF. WE'LL HOW TO MOBILE IT COVERTLY TEN NOW. WE ARE. WITH SERVICE PROVIDERS TO CREATE FOURTEEN TESTING SITES OR CLIENTS FAMILY MEMBERS SERVICE PROVIDERS AND STAFF AND REGIONAL CENTER STAFF. MOBILE TESTING IS ALSO AVAILABLE IN TRAVEL TO SITE IS NOT POSSIBLE. NO COST NO CHARGE FOR TESTING OF THE TESTING TASK FORCE OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY MADE THIS EFFORT POSSIBLE FOR WHICH WE ARE VERY GRATEFUL. LEARN MORE ABOUT THE NEED FOR EXPANDING TECHNOLOGY IN REMOTE RURAL AREAS AND FOR CLIENTS AND FAMILIES THAT ARE JUST A FINANCIALLY DISADVANTAGED. THE MAJOR CHALLENGES AND DIFFICULTIES AT THIS MOMENT R. AS HAS BEEN SAID. OBTAINING VACCINATIONS OF THE DIFFICULTIES ARE BECAUSE OF INSUFFICIENT NOTICES GAINES IMPERIAL AND SAN DIEGO COUNTIES. SAN DIEGO COUNTY IMPAIR IMPERIAL COUNTIES. CAL FIRE CBS IN WALL GREEN AND WALKING PHARMACIES HAVE BEEN OUTSTANDING IN THEIR PREPARATION AND THE COMMUNICATION. OF WHICH OFFICIALS- QUANTITIES OF VACCINES OTHER CHALLENGES SHOULD. AND HOPEFULLY WILL QUICKLY DISSIPATE. I CHALLENGE CREAMS SYSTEMS FOR REAL SIR PRIOR FOR TO AND ALTERNATIVE SERVICES- WAS A RECENT CHALLENGE AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF WORK. GOOD NINETEEN BURNED OUT AND RELAX IN OUR GUARDS CHALLENGE AFTER THE THANKSGIVING CHRISTMAS AND NEW YEAR'S DAY HOLIDAYS HAS BEEN SET THE RATE OF COMMON INFECTIONS EXPLODED ON OUR CLIENTS AND OUR SERVICE PROVIDERS STAFF. THE STATE CAN WORK TO SUPPORT REGIONAL CENTERS AND IF YOU JUST POPLATION IN THE COMING MONTHS BY. CONTINUING THE TREMENDOUS SUPPORT AND THAT WE HAVE RECEIVED ACROSS THE STATE ARE BEGINNING- FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC FROM OUR PARTNERS IN SACRAMENTO. BY CONTINUING TO WORK WITH OUR SYSTEM EXAMINING THE NEED TO PAY LIVING WAGES TO THE DIRECT CARE STAFF OF SERVICE PROVIDERS ACROSS CALIFORNIA. I CONTINUING TO WORK WITH OUR SYSTEM X. IN EXAMINING THE NEED TO REDUCE THE CASELOAD RATIOS IN REGIONAL CENTRES ACROSS CALIFORNIA. MY AND CONCERNS ONCE WE EMERGE FROM THE PANDEMIC ARE. THE CALIFORNIA'S IT HAS A CLEAR PLAN AS WE PREPARE TO RETURN TO PROVIDING SERVICES IN PERSON. I'M VISUAL SYSTEM THAT TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION THE LESSONS LEARNED AND EXAMINES WAYS TO MAKE OUR SYSTEM MORE FLEXIBLE AND LESS COMPLICATED FOR THE PEOPLE WE SERVE AND THEIR FAMILIES. I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE POSSIBLE REGRESSION AND PEOPLE SKILLS AND BEHAVIORS BECAUSE OF THE LENGTH. OF THE PANDEMIC. I ENVISIONED WE RESUME DISCUSSING THE RATE STUDY COMPLETED BY BROWN'S ASSOCIATES AND WE REFORM AND UNTANGLE OUR RATE SYSTEM AND ADEQUATELY REIMBURSED SERVICE PROVIDERS. I ENVISION A SYSTEM THAT EFFECTIVELY UTILIZES TECHNOLOGY. ESPECIALLY ESPECIALLY IN A RURAL HARD TO REACH AREAS AND FOR CLIENTS AND FAMILIES WHO LACK THE WHO LACK THE TECHNOLOGY BECAUSE OF FINANCIAL HARDSHIP. AND FINALLY I ENVISION A SYSTEM. IS SYSTEM WIDE CAMPAIGN TO RESTORE THE REFERRALS AND NUMBER OF INFANTS AND TODDLERS SERVES NEARLY START PROGRAM. MMHM IN CLOSING. I THANK THE MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE IN ALL CALIFORNIA LEGISLATORS IN CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE STAFF FOR THE TREMENDOUS SUPPORT THAT YOU PROVIDE FOR PERSONS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES IN CALIFORNIA. THIS CONCLUDES MY REMARKS. THANK YOU SIR NEXT WE HAVE ELIZABETH GOMEZ DIRECTOR OF THE INTEGRATED COMMUNITY COLLABORATIVE. HI GOOD AFTERNOON. I THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY HERE TODAY MY NAME IS ELIZABETH GOMEZ AND I HAVE TWO SONS ONE OF WHICH HAS DOWN SYNDROME BOTH OF MY CHILDREN HAVE RECEIVED SERVICES FROM THE REGIONAL CENTER. I AM THE DIRECTOR OF THE INTEGRATED COMMUNITY COLLABORATIVE. AN ORGANIZATION THAT PROVIDES OUTREACH AND ASSISTANCE TO UNDERSERVED LATINO FAMILIES SERVED BY REGIONAL CENTERS. THROUGH THE DEVIOUS DISPARITY GRANT PROGRAM WE HELP FAMILIES NAGRIK NAVIGATE THE SYSTEM WE WORK HAND IN HAND TO BREAK DOWN BARRIERS ON A PEER TO PEER BASIS. TO OUR COMMUNITY AND FIGURE OUT THE ORDERS. WE HAVE THE COMMUNITY TRUST BECAUSE WE ARE THE COMMUNITY. WE ARE ALSO VERY THANKFUL FOR SO MANY PEOPLE WHO HAVE HELPED US LIKE OUR DIRECTOR NANCY BARGE MEN AND OTHER DEVIOUS STAFF ALSO WANT TO THANK OTHER COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS WHO ALSO HELPED US AND CONTRIBUTE- WITH HER WORK. THIS YEAR OUR FAMILY'S HARDSHIPS ARE AT A WHOLE DIFFERENT LEVEL. CORBETT HAS MAGNIFIED THE DISPARITIES MANY OF OUR FAMILIES CAN FIND MONEY TO PAY FOR FOOD AND RENT AND CAN ACCESS EDUCATION BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF TECHNOLOGY AND SUPPORTS. IN TO MANY OF US HAVE GOTTEN COBIT THE DATA SHOWS HOW VULNERABLE WE ARE. THIS YEAR OUR FAMILY'S HARDSHIPS ARE A WHOLE DIFFERENT LEVEL. THEY ARE MAGNIFIED BY ALL THE ISSUES THAT WE ARE ALL WORKING WITH AND I WANT TO SHARE A FEW SUGGESTIONS FROM THE WORK THAT WE HAVE BEEN DOING WITH A LATINO FAMILIES DURING THE PANDEMIC. THE DIRECTIVES WORK. ONLY IF IMPLEMENTED PROPERLY THE DIRECTORS THAT DDS ISSUED SHOULD BE HELPFUL FOR OUR FAMILIES. BUT THERE IS SOMETIMES A WALL WE HIT AT THE REGIONAL CENTERS SOME REGIONAL CENTERS HAVE TOLD US. THAT THE DIRECTOR SORRY ARE NOT REQUIREMENTS THAT THEY ARE SOMETIMES JUST SUGGESTIONS. THEY DON'T APPLY TO EVERYONE WE ARE SEEING A DISCONNECT BETWEEN HOW THIS MEASURES WERE MEANT TO HELP FAMILIES BUT IN MANY CASES THEY DO NOT. IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO HAVE A CLEAR DIRECTIVE THAT IS NOT LEFT UP TO THE TWENTY ONE DIFFERENT INTERPRETATIONS. THE COMMUNITY VOICE MUST BE HEARD. THE MOST OUR COMMUNITY SHOULD BE CONSULTED AT ALL LEVELS FROM THE VERY BEGINNING A COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATION. PARTNERS CAN PLAY A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IF YOU TAKE OUR CONCERNS SERIOUSLY AND IF YOU DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. CALDERON HUMILITY WORKS THIS IS THEM ALL OFTEN LACKS A SENSE OF COMPASSION FOR FAMILIES THEY MUST GO THROUGH UNREALISTIC TO OBTAIN THE MUCH NEEDED SERVICES. THEY FEEL HUMILIATED FOR HAVING TO BEG FOR EXTRA HOURS OF SUPPORT. WHEN THEY ARE DENIED OUR FAMILIES WHO PRIMARILY SPEAK SPANISH ARE TOLD THAT THEY SHOULD GO FOR A FAIR HEARING. BUT THERE IS NOTHING FAIR ABOUT THE HEARINGS WHEN OUR FAMILIES DON'T UNDERSTAND THE PROCESS OR THE LAW IN THE REGIONAL CENTERS BRING LAWYERS AND EXPERIENCED STAFF. THERE ARE BRIGHT SPOTS BUT EVERYONE COULD DO A BETTER JOB OF VALIDATING EMBRACING AND SUPPORTING OUR COMMUNITY. COBIT REQUIRES A SENSE OF URGENCY. AND IT SADDENS ME WHEN A FAMILY MEMBER TURN SO THE REGIONAL CENTERS WHEN THEY GET COLD IT AND THERE IS NO SENSE OF URGENCY THERE IS NO PROTOCOL. REGIONAL CENTER SOMETIMES WAIT WEEKS BEFORE PROVIDING AN ANSWER TO A REQUEST FOR HELP. WE HEAR THAT SOME FAMILIES. ONE EVEN REPORT THAT SOMEONE HAS TESTED POSITIVE BECAUSE THEY THEY CAN'T RISK LOSING SERVICES FOR THEIR CHILDREN. FAMILIES ARE TRULY SCARE. JUST A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO WE WERE ASSISTING A FAMILY WHO WAS DENIED ADDITIONAL RESPITE HOURS THE MOM WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF A HIGH RISK PREGNANCY AND HAD TWO OTHER CHILDREN WITH AUTISM. SHE HAD TO GO TO A FAIR HEARING OVER THE PHONE TO MAKE THAT. EVEN WORSE BARRIER IT WAS SO STRESSFUL IN THE MEANING FOR HER THAT A FEW HOURS LATER SHE WENT INTO LABOR AND SHE DELIVERED HER BABY PREMATURELY THE BABY STILL IN THE NICK YOU. NO ONE WANTS TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY PARENTS ARE RUNNING IN A MAYES THAT NEVER ENDS THEY ASKED FOR HELP FROM THE REGIONAL CENTERS AND THEY POINT THEM TOWARDS THE SCHOOL SYSTEM. THE SCHOOL SENT PARENTS BACK TO THE REGIONAL CENTERS AND NO ONE GETS ANY HELP. VACCINES HAVE BEEN ANOTHER ISSUE OF DISPARITY. MANY LATINOS WERE AFRAID OF THE VACCINEAT THE BEGINNING. EVEN WHEN THEY WERE ELIGIBLE TO GET IT. WE HAVE BEEN EDUCATING OURSELVES AND NOW THAT THEY SOME OF THEM WANT TO TAKE THE VACCINE. BUT SOME HAVE TO ASK FOR A LETTER FROM THE REGIONAL CENTERS AND EVEN THAT SOMETIMES HAS BEEN A FIGHT. MANY LATINO PARENTS HAVE BEEN TURNED DOWN. OUR FAMILIES. ARE THE FRONTLINE WORKERS NOW. THEY ARE THE TEACHERS THE AIDS THE PURPOSE. EVERYTHING ELSE FOR THEIR KIDS WITH MINIMAL HELP. THEY ARE THE TRUE HEROES AND THEY SHOULD NOT HAVE TO BEG FOR EVERYTHING. I'M HERE TO ASK FOR HELP. AND INCOMPLETE I'LL SAY THAT THE ICC CAN FIGURE OUT THE ORDER. I HAVE A GREAT RELATIONSHIP WITH SOME OF THE REGIONAL CENTERS AND WE'RE HERE TO SERVE. POOR THEIR WORK IN HOURS WE BELIEVE THAT WE CAN COLLABORATE TOGETHER AND THAT WE CAN MAKE A CHANGE FOR OUR COMMUNITY. ALSO WOULD LIKE TO THANK DEPARTMENT FOR ALL THE WORK AND THEIR- AND ALL THE SUPPORT THAT THEY PROVIDE TO COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THE ICC. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS COMMONS FOR YOUR COMMENTS AND YOUR ADVOCACY. NEXT WE HAVE A ON CARUTHERS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE STATE COUNCIL ON DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS AMERICAN BROTHERS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE STATE COUNCIL ON DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. STATE BODY WITH INDEPENDENT AUTHORITY TO INFORM AND ADVOCATEFOR PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES AND THEIR FAMILIES AND ALSO A MEMBER OF THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH COMMUNITY VACCINE ADVISORY COMMITTEE I'M WITH THE TWO QUESTIONS ABOUT ASPEN RESPOND TO ABOUT TO START WITH THE SECOND FIRST- AND THAT'S THE I. D. PERSPECTIVE REALLY HAS BEEN PRESENT THROUGHOUT VARIOUS FORMS. FIVE OF THE SEVENTY MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE BACKS IF IS YOUR COMMITTEE ARE DISABILITY ADVOCATES AND- I WE'VE ISSUED JOINT LETTERS TOGETHER ARE THOSE LETTERS WHICH CIRCULATED THROUGH FOR COMMITTEE SIGN ON THAT'S RESULTED IN A TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY ORGANIZATIONS. JOINING INTO THESE EFFORTS ON THOSE ORGANIZATIONS ARE REACHED OUT TO THEIR MEMBERS SO THAT THEY CAN BE HEARD AND WE THINK THAT'S RESULTED IN THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE CONTACTING THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE- INDIVIDUALS SHARE THEIR STORIES- IN THAT WITH THE PRESS. SO IN SOME THERE THERE WERE MANY FORMS THERE ARE MANY AVENUES NOR MANY VOICES WITH ONE MESSAGE PRIORITIZE PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. AND OTHER DISABILITIES NOW. AND LAST WEEK BECAUSE PERFECT RESPONDED WITH. THANK YOU DIRECTOR. FOR OUT. MY WHAT PURPOSE IS GRAY. ISN'T REALLY THIS. IS A WIN. WELL WE WANT TO BE EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY THERE ARE REASONS TO HAVE AN EFFECTIVE MARCH FIFTEENTH. ABOUT THAT TIME LINE DOES NOT TAKE AWAY FROM THIS BEING THE MOST FORWARD THINKING INCLUSIVE CRITERIA I'VE SEEN- THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY I THINK YOU SAW IN YOUR PRODUCT ROCKY HARLING WHETHER STATES ARE DOING IT. AND WHAT CALIFORNIA DID WAS KIND OF TOOK THE BEST FROM OTHER STATES WERE DOING AND IT TOGETHER INTO ONE PROPOSAL. EVEN WITNESSED PRAISE THERE ARE CRITICAL ELEMENTS WE STILL NEED TO WORK FOR I TO COME TO MIND WHO AND HOW- THE CRITERIA IS A LIST OF CONDITIONS AND EXPERIENCES AND I THINK THIS ALLOWS THE STATE AN OPPORTUNITY. THE MEDICAL SYSTEM DOES NOT HAVE THE CAPACITY FOR INDIVIDUAL DETERMINATION OF EACH REGIONAL CENTER CONSUMER OF EACH PERSON TO DEVELOP IN THE SOMEBODY EACH PERSON WHO FITS THIS CRITERIA. SO THERE'S A SOLUTION FOR THAT. THE STATE CAN EMPLOY THE DEATH. BY STATE. ALL REGIONAL CENTER CONSUMERS MEET THE DEFINITION. OF CRITERIA COPE WITH LIFE THREATENING YES WE KNOW THAT TO BE TRUE SECOND CRITERIA CORPORATE LIMITS. ORIGINAL CENTERS CONSUMERS ABILITY GET REGULAR KERR ABSOLUTELY THREE CRITERIA PROVIDING KOBE CARE WILL BE CHALLENGING BECAUSE A PERSON'S DISABILITY. ABSOLUTELY SO THE STATE CAN ISSUE THIS REGIONAL CONSUMERS REGIONAL CENTER CONSUMERS CAN ALSO ISSUE THIS FOR. OUR DETERMINATION FOR ALL AGES AS RECIPIENTS- THROUGH DSS AND ALL SEA BASS PARTICIPANTS THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING AND- EACH PERSON IN THESE PROGRAMS HERE'S WHAT'S KEY YOU HAVE RECEIVED AN INDIVIDUAL REVIEW. ALL RIGHTY TO DETERMINE THE BETTER DISABILITY IS SEVERE ENOUGH TO QUALIFY FOR THE STATE SERVICES. SO ANOTHER ISSUE A SEVERITY IS NOT NEEDED. ALSO IT'S HARD TO MANAGING WHAT REGIONAL CENTER CONSUMER WOULD NOT MEET THESE CONDITIONS AND- MAKE ME REGIONAL CENTER CONSUMERS AND FAMILIES HAVE BEEN LIVING IN ISOLATION FOR A YEAR FOR A- YEAR. HOW COOL WOULD WITH THREATEN THEIR LIVES AND IMPACT OR SERVICES. THANK YOU LET'S BECOME MASTERS DETAILING AND REALLY GREAT STORIES. THAT WHAT PEOPLE ARE LIVING WITH. SO THE STATE STILL NEEDS TO WORK OUT WHO ENSURING PERFECT DAHLE READ CENTER. SITES RESEARCH AND ABOUT TO SPEND. IT'S EFFECTIVE TO. APPROACH THAT LEVERAGES THE REVIEW OF SEVERITY IT'S ALREADY BEEN COMPLETED. BY MY ESTIMATE IS THAT THIS WOULD BE ABOUT UNDER SIXTY FIVE YEARS OLD SO MANAGEABLE NUMBER. MOVING FROM WHO TO HOW ADVOCATES OF ALSO GAUGING HOW TO GET THE VACCINE TO CONSUMERS. AND EARLY DRAFT FROM THE DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH SAID PEOPLE DISABILITY SHOULD NOT GET VACCINATED MAX MASS SITES. THANKFULLY THIS IS DROPPED AWAY PEOPLE WITH ID SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO OBTAIN THE VACCINE AT WHATEVER LOCATION MEETS THEIR NEEDS. THAT COULD BE A MASS LOCATION COULD BE WITH HER HEALTH CARE PROVIDER COULD BE AT A PHARMACY WHATEVER IS AVAILABLE TO ANYONE ELSE. SHOULD REMAIN AVAILABLE TO PEOPLE WITH IDT. ADDITIONALLY OUR COMMUNITY HAS A RICH NETWORK TO PROVIDE COMMUNITY ACCESS POINTS. AS I SAY WE'RE SCRAPPY- GIVE IT SOMETHING AND WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT WORK SO FOR EXAMPLE THE STATE COUNCIL WE HAVE SEVENTY STAFF THROUGHOUT THE STATE WERE ABLE TO DISTRIBUTE. A HUNDRED AND FIVE. POINT FIVE MILLION PIECES OF PP OVER THE LAST YEAR- THANK YOU TO THE- TO LISA AND OTHERS TO COMMENT ABOUT THAT PARTNERSHIP AND WE JUST DID IT IS TAPPING INTO. BY THE SOUTH AFRICAN NETWORKS THE FAMILY ADVOCATE NETWORKS THE PROVIDERS THE REGIONAL CENTERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE- IT'S REALLY A MIX OF FORMAL AND INFORMAL NETWORKS. IT'S ENGAGED AND IT'S READY TO ACTIVATE A VACCINES SO I THINK THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE STATE IS TO HAVE THE THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATOR. USE OUR NETWORKS TO INCREASE COMMUNITY YOU CAN REACH ACCESS POINTS I WILL PROVIDE LOCATION STAFF PAPERWORK THEY PROVIDE MET BACK SEEMS A MEDICAL STAFF. THERE'S A LOT OF ADVANTAGES TO THIS APPROACH INCLUDING PROVIDING VACCINES AND MILLER SETTINGS- THIS INCREASES TRUST IT REDUCES VACCINE HESITANCY MAY ACTUALLY USE SOME OF THE CHALLENGES OF PEOPLE JUST DON'T LIKE SHOTS. IT ALSO PROVIDES THE SERVICES TYPICALLY PROVIDED IN A VARIETY OF LANGUAGES WITH CULTURAL AWARENESS SO. THAT MAYBE BRIDGE THERE TO- ALSO ON HOW WE NEED TO HAVE BEEN SALUTE- IDEAS COULD BE DONE BY LEVERAGE PEDRO. CENTER TRANSFER. PROVIDERS TO GET PEOPLE TO COMMUNITY VACCINE EVENTS- ALSO CREDIBLY WE COULD GET THE SERVICES TO VACCINATORS. USE THE SERVICES TO GET BACK CENTERS TO PEOPLE WE'RE TRULY HOMEBOUND. ALSO PART OF HOUSE WE HAVE TO ADDRESS EQUITY. I THINK COMMUNITY IN RIDGEWOOD PART OF THIS FOR THE REASONS ALREADY MENTIONED BUT ANOTHER WAY IS TO CREATE A PRIORITY ACCESS CODE FOR MASS SITES AND SET ASIDE APPOINTMENTS- FOR BY PARK AND OTHERS WHO ARE UNDERSERVED. LASTLY THE VACCINE SHOULD REMAIN VOLUNTARY SO PEOPLE CAN MAKE DECISIONS THAT ARE PASSED FROM CONDITIONS AND THEIR OWN HOUSE. WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING BETWEEN NOW AND MARCH FIFTEENTH TO MAKE THIS A SUCCESSFUL CAN BE THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR. WITH THAT WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE DíAS TO SEE IF ANY MEMBERS HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRAZIER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH CHAIR OF ONE OF THE QUESTIONS I'D LIKE TO ADDRESSES TO TWO OF THE REGIONAL CENTER DIRECTORS LISA AND- AND CARLOS. IS THAT. WHERE HAVE THE HEALTH PLAN'S BEEN DANI'S SOCIAIS WHERE THEY HAVE THIS DATA. A BASE OF WHO IS- OF THE ID POPULATION WE'RE ARE THEY IN CONJUNCTION OF HELPING OF BRING THE POPULATION TOGETHER TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE BEING PROTECTED HAVE YOU HAD ANY OPPORTUNITIES. FROM ANY OF THE HMO AND PPO SHOWS THAT THAT ARE OUT THERE TO. CREATE A WILLINGNESS TO BE ABLE TO HELP THIS POPULATION. I CAN START ON THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRAZIER- WE HAVE NOT WORKED WITH HEALTH PLANS ON THIS BECAUSE UP UNTIL THIS POINT THE VACCINE DISTRIBUTION HAS FOCUSED ON BOTH THE FEDERAL PARTNERSHIP FOR PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN. LICENSE RESIDENTIAL CARE AND IT HAS BEEN THROUGH THE COUNTY SO VERY FEW INDIVIDUAL PROVIDERS UP UNTIL THIS POINT WOULD BE THROUGH THE HEALTH PLANS HAVE HAD ACCESS TO VACCINES I DON'T KNOW IF THAT WILL CHANGE IN THE FUTURE BUT THAT'S BEEN. OUR EXPERIENCE UP UNTIL THIS POINT AND ACTUALLY SOME OF EVEN THE TRACKING ON THE VACCINE HASN'T APPEARED TO BE CENTRALIZED TO THE HEALTH PLANS AS OF YET SO THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEMBER FRAZIER THIS IS CARLOS FLORES DIRECTOR RESIGNING REGIONAL CENTER WE- WE HAVEN'T HAD. ANY PLANNING. WITH OUR MANAGER OUR MEDICARE ON MANAGED CARE PLANS- REGARDING VACCINATIONS BUT WITH THE EXCEPTION OF KAISER KAISER IS PROVIDING VACCINATIONS WHAT'S MORE IMPORTANT THOUGH IS JUST SENSE OF THE PANDEMIC BEGAN. IS WE'VE HAD- CLOSE RELATIONSHIPS WITH ALL OF THE MANAGED CARE PLANS TO ENSURE THAT DURING THE PANDEMIC PEOPLE GET THEIR OTHER MEDICAL ATTENTION THAT THEY NEED TO ROUTINE CARE AND EMERGENCIES AND- OTHER THINGS THAT ARE NECESSARY. SO THEY'VE BEEN REALLY GOOD ABOUT PARTICIPATING IN THOSE DISCUSSIONS MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE WANT ABOUT MOST BUILDINGS- RECEIVE THE CARE THAT THEY NEED THAT IS NOT COVERED RELATED. AND WHAT. IS COVERED RELATED THEY'VE BEEN EQUALLY. WITH REGARDS TO HOUSE A EXCEL CENTER. THAT'S YOUR SIR YEAH THANK YOU SO THIS WOULDN'T QUESTION I LIKE TO DRAW ON DIRECTOR BARGAIN. SO WHEN YOU MENTION THE ADDITIONAL RESPITE CARE OF FLEXIBILITY AND WHATNOT WHAT OTHER PROVISIONS ARE BEING MADE FOR SOMEONE KIND OF A PARA PROFESSIONAL. WHO WITH THE CHILD OR ADULT HAS BEHAVIORAL ISSUES DUE TO THE CONSTRAINTS OF CO GOOD FOR WEEKS THEY NEED ONE ON ONE ON A LARGER BASIS. FAMILIES ABLE TO BE ABLE TO CARE FOR THE INDIVIDUAL BECAUSE OF THE ADDITIONAL STRESSES- THEY'VE BEEN BROUGHT THEIR WHOLE LIFE IS CHANGED HELLO AND YOU KNOW THE UNIQUENESS OF CONSISTENCY AND A LOT OF THE- THE OF THE POPULATION IS NECESSARY. HOW ARE WE ADDRESSING THROUGH ON THIS CALL THAT FUNDING THE ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THOSE ADDITIONAL NAMES THROUGH BEHAVIORAL OR DUAL DIAGNOSIS. COMPONENTS THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRAZIER YOU'RE BRINGING UP A- AN ISSUE OF CONCERN THAT WE HAVE THAT I HAVE- HEARD FROM FAMILIES AND- IT WAS PROBABLY ONE OF THE FIRST AREAS IN WHICH WE IDENTIFIED. A CONCERN AS TO HOW OUR FAMILIES NOW THAT ARE HAVING AT HOME LEARNING THEIR HAVING TO SUPPORT- THEIR CHILD TO HAVE REALLY EXTENSIVE NEEDS AND NEEDING SUPPORT BUT THEN. WE WERE HEARING THAT THERE ARE- SERVICE PROVIDERS- UNDERSTANDABLY- THAT WE'RE NOT ABLE TO GO AND PROVIDE IN PERSON SUPPORT AND INTERVENTION- BOTH FOR THE SAFETY OF THE FAMILY AND FOR THE SAFETY OF THE- IT COULD BE THE ABA PROVIDER COULD BE THE SUPPORT PERSON THAT'S GIVING RELIEF THAT CAN BE YOU KNOW A NUMBER OF SUPPORT GOING INTO THE HALL. OUR FAMILIES HAVE FACED A HORRIFIC YEAR THERE'S JUST NO THERE'S NOTHING THAT THAT I CAN SAY THAT IS MANY OF THE RELEASED THE FLEXIBILITIES THAT WE ALL PUT IN THERE IS THAT WE HAVE FAMILIES THAT HAVE REALLY STRUGGLED AND BEING ABLE TO KIND OF NAVIGATE HOW TO FACE A PARTICULAR CHALLENGE SITUATIONS THAT SAD. LIKE YOU HAD NOTED RESPITE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT REST THAT WAS ACCEPTABLE AND AVAILABLE- MANY OF THE REGIONAL CENTERS- HAD IMMEDIATELY STARTED INCREASING ROUTES THAT ARE LOOKING AT PERSONAL ASSISTANCE- SO FAMILY MEMBERS- COULD USE MAYBE PARTICIPANT DIRECTED TO SUPPORT WITHIN THEIR OWN FAMILY UNIT- ADDITIONALLY WHEN WE TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OF THE MORE RECENT DIRECTIVES RELATED TO VACCINES AND DEFINITIONS. REALLY THE REASON WHY I WANTED TO BE ABLE TO GET CLARITY AS YOU THOSE DEFINITIONS FOR WHO IS A HEALTHCARE WORKER WAS BECAUSE THE THESE ARE THE FAMILY MEMBERS THAT ARE SUPPORTING INDIVIDUALS IN THE HALL. YOU KNOW A CHILD WITH HIGHLY COMPLEX NEEDS AND SO WANTED TO PROVIDE WHAT EVER REALLY KNOWING IT'S STILL A CHALLENGE THAT WE CAN PROVIDE IN THE HOME- MAKING SURE THAT WE TOOK THE BARRIER AWAY. NOT. HAVING ACCESS ON BASED ON I'M IN. LOOKING AT ALTER. HAVING PROVIDER IMMEDIATELY AND BE ABLE TO DOING REMOTE SUPPORT. ENCOURAGE EVERYBODY TO BE FLEXIBLE INSTEAD OF A ONE HOUR YOU KNOW IN PERSON SUPPORT YOU KNOW MAKE IT YEAH THAT- FAMILY OR THE CHILD ARE NOT ABLE TO ATTEND FOR ONE FULL HOUR BREAK IT UP IN FIFTEEN MINUTE INCREMENTS. YOU KNOW JUST GET CREATIVE WE HAVE- REALLY USED OUR SERVICE PROVIDERS IN NON RESIDENTIAL ALSO TO START GETTING CREATIVE IN HOW DO YOU TAKE A LOOK AT YOUR GETTING- KIND OF CONNECTING PEOPLE TO BE WITH THEIR FRIENDS AND SO THEY'RE NOT AS ISOLATED- SO AGAIN EVERYBODY HAS HAD TO THINK OUTSIDE OF THE BOX. I'M ON HOW TO SUPPORT- WE HAVE SEEN- WHERE THERE'S BEEN A NEED FOR INDIVIDUALS TO- HAVE SOME RESPITE UNFORTUNATELY ONE OF THE AREAS THAT WE HAVE HAD THE GREATEST. IMPACT OF LOSS OF PROVIDERS. MORE FAILURE TO WE HAVE TO STILL SEE IF THEY'RE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE. SERVICES IS OUT OF HOME RESPITE- SO IMMEDIATELY WE REALLY DO NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AT HOW DO WE START GAINING. YOU KNOW ADAM HOME RESPITE OR THOSE RESOURCES SO FAMILIES CAN ACCESS THEM AND NOT HAVE FURTHER DELAY IN GETTING THAT REALLY- SO RIGHT NOW WE JUST HAVE TO CONTINUE TO STAY VERY DILIGENT- I THINK IT WAS- VERY WELL NOTED ABOUT YOU KNOW WHAT LONGER TERM. IMPACTS ARE GOING TO. BE FACED BY THESE FAMILIES WE HAVE TO STAY IN CONTACT WITH THEM AND SEE WHAT SUPPORT WE CAN CONTINUE TO PROVIDE- SO WE CAN- MEDICAID-ANY ADDITIONAL OUR FUTURE RESTS. ON SHOULD IT BE FACED. ONE MORE QUESTION THROUGH THE CHAIR. OF MARTIN WHEN WE- TALKED EARLIER IT WHEN THE ONSET OF CODED. THERE WAS A LOT OF CONFUSION AND I REALLY DO APPRECIATE YOUR FLEXIBILITY. COMPONENT TO THIS BECAUSE ONE SIZE DOESN'T FIT ALL AND YOU WERE ABLE TO BE ADAPTIVE. AND ACTUALLY. ENCOURAGED THE PROVIDERS TO BE FLEXIBLE AND THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX WHICH WAS UNIQUE. IN OUR WORLD- BUT WHAT I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO ASK IS IT THEN THE CONFUSION IN THE BEGINNING AND NOT WHAT HOW MANY PROVIDERS ACTUALLY WE DID WE LOSE TO ATTRITION. AND THEN ALSO WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE SCOPE OF THAT. THE WORK FORCE DON'T ON BEING DELETED ALSO WHERE ARE WE AS FAR AS BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE A QUALITY MEASURABLE OUTCOME FOR THE I. D. D. POPULATION. DUE TO THE LOSS OF PROVIDERS WHO WORKED INITIALLY ABLE TO. BEAR THE BRUNT OF THE OF THE UNCERTAINTY COM. YOU KNOW WHERE WHERE ARE WE ON THE- YEAH LET LET ME SEE IF I CAN ADDRESS THE QUESTIONS THAT I HEARD AND THEN A FURTHER CLARITY IS NEEDED PLEASE LET ME NOW- TO THE QUESTION AND I KNOW THAT ON THE NEXT PANEL I HAVE A QUESTION THAT'S BEEN ASKED OF ME- IS KIND OF WHAT IS THAT PROVIDER. NETWORK WHAT WHO HAVE WE LOST- I'LL START WITH WE HAVE LIMITED VISIBILITY INTO- IF THERE'S PROVIDERS WERE NO LONGER PROVIDING SERVICES AND WE'RE CONTINUING TO TAKE A LOOK AT IT BUT WHAT WE DO HAVE. IS WE'RE TAKING- VERY CLOSE LOOK AT THOSE PROVIDERS THAT ARE BILLING BUT WHAT WE CALL CLAIMING SO WE LOOK AT OUR CLAIMS. AND TO SEE HOW MANY PROVIDERS WHO WORK- SUBMITTING BILLS OR CLAIMS. FOR PRIOR TO KOBE AND HOW MANY- POST CODE. AND SO- JUST YOUR- WITH YOU WHAT WERE WERE SEEN AND IN THOSE NUMBERS- WE HAVE. IT NET. SO A NET DECREASE OF TWO HUNDRED NINETY EIGHT VENDORS THAT ARE NOT CLAIMING- THAT AS COMPARED TO BEFORE- MARCH TWENTY TWENTY. SO OF THAT WE HAD. ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY FOUR VENDORS THAT- WERE NOT. HAVE NOT CLAIMED CURRENTLY- SO THAT WOULD. INDICATE IS THAT LOSING THOSE PROVIDERS AND- IT RAISING THAT QUESTION- HOWEVER WHEN WE LOOK AT THOSE THAT ARE NOT CLAIMING LIKE I SAID. ONE OF OUR BIGGEST CONCERNS IS OUT OF HOME RESPITE THE OTHER ONE IS ON THIS ONE IS ACTUALLY TRANSPORTATION- WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH OUR TRANSPORTATION PROVIDERS ON HOW DO WE ESTABLISH. KIND OF THOSE ALTERNATIVE SERVICES IT'S BEEN- ONE OF THE ONES THAT HAVE BEEN THE TRICKIEST AND ESTABLISHING ALTERNATIVE SERVICES RATE. AN EXAMPLE MENTAL STAFFING SO IN IN- AT SITES WHETHER IT'S DAY PROGRAM OTHER SITES THE SUPPLEMENTAL STAFFING THESE ARE THE THREE MAIN CATEGORIES AND WHAT'S WE ARE SEEN. THOSE ONE THOUSAND SO ROUNDING UP FIFTEEN HUNDRED- PROVIDERS NOT CLAIMING WHAT THEY GET. ON THE FLIP SIDE- ACT KOBE WE HAVE AN- ESSENTIALLY TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED PROVIDERS- AND THAT'S NOT SO MUCH PROVIDERS BUT- VECTORIZATION. SO IT MAY BE USED BY EXISTING VENDORS ON SO WE HAVE THOSE THAT ARE ADDITIONAL CLAIMS NOW WE'RE SEEING SIMILAR THEN. WE'RE SUPPORT INTO RESIDENTIAL SETTINGS THAT'S BEEN AN INCREASE SO WE'RE SEEN EXISTING PROVIDERS LIKE ADDING ON SERVICE CODES- BUT TO GET TO THE QUESTION AS FAR AS LIKE THAT THE OVERALL KIND OF NETWORK- WE DON'T HAVE THAT LEVEL OF DETAIL- WE TOOK EARLY ACTION- CERTAINLY THE RETENTION PAYMENT WAS SUPPORTIVE AND HELPFUL TO PROVIDERS- BUT WE ALSO KNEW THAT THAT WAS GOING TO BE TIME LIMITED WE- RENEW THAT- NOT ONLY WAS IT NOT SOMETHING THAT WAS SUSTAINABLE WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE. GETTING VISIBILITY AND TO HELP PROVIDERS WERE PROVIDING SERVICES TO CONSUMERS. I'M SO WE REALLY NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT IS OUR ALTERNATIVE APPROACH BECAUSE WE WERE ALSO NOT GOING TO BE GETTING FEDERAL DOLLARS. SO WE QUICKLY LOOKED AT AND WORK WITH PROVIDERS AND WE GOT INPUT FROM AN ID NUMBER OF OUR STAKEHOLDERS TO SAY OKAY WE GET AS AS MRS GOMEZ HAD NOTED. WE HAD FAMILIES THAT NEEDED FOOD SO WE NEED TO THINK REALLY DIFFERENTLY AND SAY OKAY NOW IS ABOUT THE TIME OF BEING ALTERNATIVE. NO MEETING PEOPLE WHERE THEY ARE SO EVERYTHING FROM THAT TO SOME EXTREMELY CREATIVE YOUNG MUSICAL TALENTS THAT STARTED DOING SOME PRETTY CREATIVE THINGS AND I. I THINK THAT THAT THERE'S SOME GOOD THINGS HAVE COME OUT OF- SOME OF THE BEST STRUGGLES THAT WE FACE IN THESE CHALLENGES THAT HOPEFULLY IS MEETING SOME OF THE NEEDS AND WE'RE GOING TO HELP US KIND OF GET BACK TO- MAYBE DIFFERENTLY BUT- FOCUS YOU KNOW. ON A NEW NORMAL. SO IF YOU MISSED ANY OF YOUR QUESTIONS PLEASE LET ME KNOW NO YOU DID UNITS INCLUDE HELLO VERY WELL I JUST HAVE TO GATHER THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH FOR ADAPTING IN BEING FLEXIBLE LOT OF. YOUR ROCKER SEES DON'T DO THAT AND I THINK THAT THROUGH THAT PROCESS A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT COULD HAVE BEEN HARMED. WORF'S HELPED SUBSTANTIALLY AND I REALLY WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRAZIER ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. SEE NON- BRING IT HERE TO THE CHAIR- I WILL HAVE A HANDFUL OF QUESTIONS AND I WOULD LIKE TO START DIRECTOR PARCHMENT BY A KNOWLEDGE SHARING AND APPRECIATING THE ANNOUNCEMENT THAT CAME OUT LAST FRIDAY. I WOULD LIKE TO AGREE WITH- MISTER CARRUTHERS THAT IT WAS INNOVATIVE AND FORWARD THINKING AND NOW IT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE SURE IT'S IMPLEMENTED WELL. I WANTED TO GIVE YOU AN OPPORTUNITY IF I COULD TO- EXPLAIN THE RATIONALE FOR THE MARCH FIFTEENTH DATE TO EMPLOYMENT THE ANNOUNCEMENT. ABOUT THE PRIORITIZATION FOR IDT AND CAN THE STATE BE MOVED UP OR THE APPROACH XCELERATED AND IF NOT WHY NOT. YEAH THANK YOU DR RAM ELEVEN- SO AS FAR AS VISIBILITY INTO THE ULTIMATE DECISION UP ON MARCH FIFTEENTH. I AS DIRECTOR CROWTHER'S HAD NOTED THAT THERE'S REALLY REASONS WHEN YOU TAKE A LOOK AT A THE READINESS OF- THE AMOUNT OF VACCINES THAT ARE AVAILABLE- NEEDING TO GET THROUGH- THE PRIORITY THAT'S ALREADY BEEN ESTABLISHED IN TIER ONE A. AND ONE B. IS REALLY IMPORTANT- AND- YOU DON'T EMPHASIZING THOSE NEXT STEPS ARE ARE REALLY CRITICAL. SO THAT GIVES US THE TIME AND SPACE TO DO THAT THERE MAY HAVE BEEN OTHER AREAS THAT HAVE INFLUENCED THE DECISION FOR THE MARCH FIFTEENTH DATE- CERTAINLY THE GUIDELINES WORK GROUP HAD. A LOT OF FACTORS THAT THEY WERE LOOKING NOT NOT ONLY WITHIN THE DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY- FIELD BUT ALSO JUST THE BROADER CONTEXT AT THOSE AT RISK INDIVIDUALS- SO YOU KNOW WE CAN CERTAINLY GET SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BACK TO YOU- REGARDING THAT- AS FAR AS- BEING- YOU KNOW GETTING THAT SOONER- IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THAT IS. IS NOT AN OPTION THE DECISIONS HAVE BEEN MADE HOWEVER I CAN CERTAINLY TAKE BACK- THE QUESTION- FOR FURTHER ELABORATION SHOULD THAT BE NEEDED. RIGHT NOW WE REALLY NEED TO FOCUS ON THE HOUSE. HOW ARE WE GOING TO BE ABLE TO BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY THOSE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE POTENTIALLY STRUGGLING TO BE ABLE TO GET TO A VACCINATION SITE. I ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE INDIVIDUALS WITHIN THE REGIONAL CENTER SYSTEM THAT ARE SIXTY FIVE AND OLDER YEAH WE REALLY AREN'T MAKING SURE THAT THEY ARE GETTING ACCESS TO VACCINATIONS. THAT WERE NOT LEAVING THEM BEHIND IT GIVES US THAT TIME TO ALSO DO THAT. AND THEN LIKE I SAID IDENTIFY THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE GOING TO NEED FURTHER ASSISTANCE WE'RE ALSO GOING TO HAVE THE TIME TO WORK WITH THE THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATOR- ON ON MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE SOME SYSTEMIC AND STRUCTURE TO- THE ROLL OUT IN THIS NEXT PHASE. IT DOES GIVE US- TIME TO WORK IN COLLABORATION I WILL SAY ONE OF THE WORK GROUPS THE- WORKGROUP THAT DIRECTOR CROWTHER'S HAD. PARTICIPATED IN IN THE ADVISORY GROUP AND THE OTHER FOR ADVOCATES- REALLY HAD IMPORTANT. IMPORTANT THEY CAN SEE THAT- HELP INFORM THE GUIDELINES WORK GROUP BUT ALSO STEM FROM THAT HAS COME A- IMPLEMENTATION WORK GROUP- WHICH- ALL THOSE SAME PARTNERS ARE INVOLVED IN AND THAT'S WHERE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO REALLY GET TOO GRANULAR DETAIL TO YOU. HOW DO WE GO QUESTION THAT CAME UP AS THE LETTER HOW ARE WE GOING TO YOU KNOW HAVE AN EVIDENCE OF VERIFICATION- AND SO THOSE ARE THE DECISIONS THAT WE NEED TO- MAKE QUICKLY AND SWIFTLY SO WE CAN I'M NOT HAVE OUR FAMILY. STRUGGLE TO GETTING THAT ACCESS. MISTER SERVING DURING. COMMENTS STATE THAT BELIEVES THAT DATA IS CURRENTLY UNDER REPORTED. HE SAID THAT THE PANDEMIC HIGHLIGHTED THE NEED FOR US TO HAVE BETA BETTER DATA SYSTEMS. AND I'D LIKE TO. FOLLOW UP IF I COULD ASK THE ADMINISTRATION. TO ADOPT A DATA DASHBOARD ON VACCINE ACCESS FOR THE I. D. D. COMMUNITY. SO THAT WE CAN SHOW HOW MUCH PROGRESS IS BEING MADE TO VACCINATE THOSE WHO ARE SERVED BY THE LANTERN ACT. AND WANTED TO GET YOUR RESPONSE. YEAH WE'VE BEEN VERY COMMITTED TO TRANSPARENCY IN OUR DATA- AND WHEN WE EARLY ON WE MADE A STRONG COMMITMENT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE POSTING ON OUR WEBSITE. FOR ALL TO SEE THAT KOBE AND- DATA AS FAR AS THE NUMBER OF POSITIVES AND STANLEY AGAIN THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO PASSED. BASED ON WHAT RESIDENTS HI BASED ON ETHNICITY BASED ON AGE I'M AND I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE EQUALLY IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE ALSO DEMONSTRATING THAT- THE INFORMATION FOR THOSE WHO ARE RECEIVING THE VACCINE IS GOING TO BE HELPFUL FOR US ALSO TO BE INFORMED WHERE DO WE NEED TO FOCUS. EFFORT IF WE'RE SEEN AND ANY PARTICULAR POPULATION OR- AT RISK GROUP- THAT IS. CERTAINLY THOSE THAT ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED THAT WE MAKE SURE THAT WE GET WE'RE RESPONSIE TO IT- WE DO HAVE OUR SYSTEM WHAT THEN. WHAT'S CALLED STAND AS THE REGIONAL CENTERS AND A REGIONAL CENTERS HAVE ALREADY STARTED POPULATING THAT INFORMATION- SO WE'RE WE'RE ALREADY GETTING ON ON DATA FROM THE REGIONAL CENTERS THAT TELLS US. WHO IS ON RECEIVING A VACCINE BUT WE ALSO WENT FURTHER WITH THAT- WE ALSO WERE ASKING WHO'S HAVING A NEGATIVE REACTION IF THERE'S ANYBODY WHO'S HAVING NEGATIVE REACTION. BUT WE'RE ALSO WANTING TO TRACK THOSE ON THAT ARE NOT GETTING IT IF IT'S BY CHOICE OR FAILURE TO ACCESS IT. SO THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO HELP INFORM US AND WE'D BE HAPPY TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE- KIND OF THAT TRANSPARENCY ON ON OUR WEBSITE- SO FOLKS CAN. ALSO TRACK IT AS WELL. THANK YOU DIRECTOR BRIDGEMAN- WANTED TO NEXT MOVE TO THE FLEXIBILITIES- CURRENTLY THERE ON A MONTH TO MONTH EXTENSION. AND WANTED TO SEE IF WE CAN GIVE SOME CLARITY LONG TERM BY EXTENDING THEM THROUGH THE END OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY- AND IF YOU THOUGHT THAT WOULD BE A REASONABLE. SOLUTION FOR US. THANK AGAIN FOR THAT THE QUESTION AND- THAT. IF I HAD NOTED WE HAD ABOUT FORTY DIFFERENCE GUIDANCE AND DIRECTIVES- WE REVIEW THOSE ON. A MONTHLY BASIS- I I'M REALLY OPEN TO HAVING A CONVERSATION- WITH THIS COMMITTEE TO IDENTIFY. YOU KNOW THOSE- ONES THAT WE'VE ALREADY. TAKEN THOSE STEPS FORWARD TO EXTEND- THAT ARE WITHIN THOSE THIRTY DAYS. FOR EXAMPLE TAKING A LOOK AT THE PARTICIPANT DIRECTED THAT WE'RE PUTTING OUT ON- THROUGH REGULATIONS- BUT ALSO EVALUATE. EVALUATING THE REMOTE ACCESS BUT IF THERE'S FURTHER- CONVERSATIONS MAY BE MORE THANHAPPY TO PARTICIPATE AND PROVIDE. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE OR INFORMATION AND DATA THAT COULD HELP INFORM-THAT DISCUSSION. THANK YOU DIRECTOR AND YOU KNOW. I MUST SAY I WAS MOVED BY MISS GOMEZ AND HEARD TESTIMONY REGARDING DISPARITIES AND- SINCE I STARTED BY FRAMING MY COMMENTS IN SPANISH TODAY I. ACTUALLY I'M REALLY TRYING TO DIG INTO THIS ISSUE A BIT MORE DIRECTOR IF I CAN. THE DISPARITIES IN THE SYSTEM AS ARE ILLUSTRATED- FROM THE ADMINISTRATION ON PAGE TWENTY FIVE OF THIS. AGENDA WHICH LOOKS AT THE- DIFFERENCES IN RESOURCE- THE POS FOR DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES OF COLOR IS. PRETTY SHOCKING ACTUALLY THERE ARE QUITE WIDE AND DISTURBING FOR MANY OF US WHO SAID ON THE STYLUS. WHAT IS IT THAT WE CAN DO IN THE NAR TERM TO HELP TO DISRUPT THESE DISPARITIES IN A MEANINGFUL WAY. THANK YOU AND- LIKE YOU I AM ALWAYS MOVES FINEST GOMEZ AND- HAVE ALWAYS VALUED HER CANDOR BUT HER PARTNERSHIP. YOU KNOW SHE IS- BEEN A RESOURCE TO ME- I'VE I'VE BEEN ABLE TO MEET WITH WITH HER AND MANY OF HER- MOMS AND WELL AS BEING ABLE TO EXTEND TO FATHERS- AND SIBLINGS- WE HAVE FOCUSED OUR WORK- OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS ON A DRESSING SERVICE ACCESS AND- EQUITY OR IN EQUITY AND IN ACCESSING SERVICES. AND WHILE WE'VE MADE SOME STRIDES- WE HAVE MORE WORK TO DO AND I'M TO THE POINT THAT YOU JUST SHARED IS TO ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT WE COULD DO TO DISRUPT AND- I'M PAYING ATTENTION TO IT- CERTAINLY ARE PROPOSAL FOR THE COMMUNITY A NAVIGATOR IS ONE OF THE ONES THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE USING. SOME OF THE INFORMATION THAT WAS SHARED- WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF PROPOSALS AND PROJECTS THROUGH THE- FUNDS THAT- WE HAVE ON AN ANNUAL BASIS OF ELEVEN MILLION SO OUR PROPOSAL IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IS TO ASK FOR OUTSIDE OF THOSE FUNDS- TO BE ABLE TO ESTABLISH THROUGHOUT THE STATE A COMMUNITY NAVIGATOR REALLY GET- THAT RESOURCE FROM A TRUSTED- PARTY THAT CAN. HELP FAMILIES NAVIGATE THE SYSTEM WHETHER IT'S WITHIN THE REGIONAL CENTERS ARE ALSO ACCESSING OTHER SERVICES- WE ALSO NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE TAKING A LOOK AT THOSE SERVICES THAT- ARE ARE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE IMPACTED DISPROPORTIONATELY OF NOT BEING ABLE TO ACCESS. SUCH AS PARTICIPANT DIRECTED ONE OF THE THINGS THAT- THERE'S BEEN THAT MANY LESSONS LEARNED DURING THE PANDEMIC- ONE OF THE VERY VALUABLE LESSONS THAT- I EIGHT I PERSONALLY LEARNED- IT WAS ALSO THROUGH SOME OF THE WORK THAT I'M THIS IS GOMEZ AND OTHER- COMMITTEE MEMBERS THAT HAVE SHARED ABOUT THE DIFFICULTY OF ACCESSING SERVICES VERTICALLY PARTICIPANT DIRECTED. WHAT WE DID WAS WE WENT AHEAD AND WE DID A STATEWIDE TRAINING FOR PARTICIPANT DIRECTED SERVICES CHIU SERVICE COORDINATORS AT THE REGIONAL CENTER SO EVERY REGIONAL CENTER PARTICIPATED. WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE MESSAGING AS TO WHAT ARE PURCHASE A DIRECT SERVICES. AND THEN ALSO. FOR THE FIRST TIME I CERTAINLY IN IN THE TEN YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN AT THE DEPARTMENT. IS THAT WE HAD A STATEWIDE TRAINING FOR FAMILY MEMBERS. AND ALSO ON- PARTICIPANT DIRECTED SO TO IT SO WHAT MRS GOMEZ WAS SAYING IS THAT THE INCONSISTENCIES BETWEEN REGIONAL CENTERS. YOU KNOW I NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHY IS SOME OF THAT PART OF THAT IS POLICY BUT PART OF IT IS REALLY COMES ALSO FROM WHAT INFORMATION ARE WE- SHARING OUT TO THE COMMUNITY THAT IS CONSISTENT BETWEEN. TO THE REGIONAL CENTERS AS WELL AS TO FAMILY MEMBERS- SO THAT IS IN ANOTHER AREA IS TO CAN YOU CONTINUE TO DO STATEWIDE TRAINING THAT IS ACCESSIBLE TO- REGIONAL CENTERS TO FAMILY MEMBERS AND TO- SO ADVOCATES- WE ALSO FOR THE FIRST TIME DID A TRAINING ON THIS. I'M ALL IN SPANISH- BECAUSE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE IT WAS A REQUEST FROM OUR COMMUNITY AND IT'S ONE OF THOSE IT'S LIKE HE SHOULD BE EASY THINGS THAT WE CAN DO. ACCESS. TO INFORMATION IS REALLY IMPORTANT. THE DIRECTOR BARGE MAN I THINK YOU WANT ON MUTE. ALSO YOU CAN HELLO THROWING UP THINGS I JUST WE LOST ABOUT FIFTEEN SECONDS OF IT I'M SORRY SO I JUST IN A STATEMENT I THINK IF IT ENDS MAYBE. REALLY IT'S GOING TO BE IMPORTANT FOR US TO CONTINUE THOSE STATEWIDE EFFORTS TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE CONSISTENT ON MESSAGING TO OUR COMMUNITY- SO FAMILIES AND SELF ADVOCATES HERE WHAT IS AVAILABLE CONSISTENTLY- ACROSS THE STATE SO ALSO THAT I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HEARD THAT WE WERE ABLE TO DO A SPANISH SPEAKING TRAINING. THAT WAS IN SPANISH AS OPPOSED TO- HAVING EIGHT INTERPRETATION- AND- FROM ENGLISH TO SPANISH- SO THESE ARE AREAS THAT WE NEED TO WORK ON THIS IS A PRIORITY OF MINE HAS BEEN AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE- TO EXPLORE YOUR SHORT AND LONG TERM- STRATEGIES TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE INTERRUPTION. YES NO EXCUSE AND I'M NOT SUGGESTING FOR A SECOND BUT THE DATA IS NOT ACCURATE BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO CONTINUE TO REPORT BASED ON- SPECIFIC SERVICES- BECAUSE THE AGGREGATE DATA- WE DO HAVE- VARIABLES THAT IMPACT THAT DATA- YOU KNOW AND AGAIN IT'S NOT MINIMIZING THE PROBLEM. THAT WE HAVE BECAUSE WE HAVE AN ISSUE AND WE HAVE TO ADDRESS IT BUT BASED ON THAT DATA AND THAT DOES INCLUDE OUR RESIDENTIAL SETTINGS- WHICH HAS- A- LARGE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE WHITE AS COMPARED TO OUR OTHER COMMUNITIES- BUT WE DO NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AT HOW DO WE SUPPORT. ALL COMMUNITIES- IN THE SAME WAY TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS SERVICES IN THE WAITED EIGHT YEARS IF IT'S AT HOME OR OUT OF ALL. THANK YOU DIRECTOR- I WAS HOPING THAT YOU COULD COMMENT ON THE ROLE THAT REGIONAL CENTER LIAISONSPLAY IN HELPING TO REDUCE DISPARITIES. AND HOW CAN WE FORMALIZE THIS NEEDED ROLE SO THAT- WE CAN. ENSURE THAT WE HAVE THE SYSTEM MIGHT BENEFITS. THANK YOU I AM ONE OF THE AREAS THAT I AM PARTICULARLY. PROUD OF- YES AND I KNOW IT CAME WITH SOME QUESTIONS FROM- SOME FOLKS IS TO THE INCREASE OF THE STAFF THAT WE PUT FORWARD- I APOLOGIZE I DON'T REMEMBER EXACTLY WHAT BUDGET YEAR BUT WE IMPLEMENTED A REORGANIZATION WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT. NOW WE ADDED JUST OVER FIFTY POSITIONS MAJORITY OF THEM REALLY WERE IN THE LATEST ON WORK IS YOU KNOW IT- SO PRIOR TO THE REORGANIZATION WE HAD FOUR LANES ON THAT WERE ACROSS THE STATE- TODAY NOW WHAT WE HAVE ARE WE HAVE SEVEN TEAMS THAT WORK WITH ALL TWENTY ONE REGIONAL CENTERS THE TEAMS HAVE ALEJO'S ON AND THEN THEY HAVE TO SUPPORT. STAFF TO BE ABLE TO HELP PROVIDE THE INFORMATION OR RESPONSE TIMELY TO FAMILIES AND TO REGIONAL CENTRES- RIGHT NOW WHAT HAS BEEN VERY HELPFUL IS JUST A RESPONSE TO COMPLAINTS. BUT ALSO JUST LISTENING AND TALKING TO THE REGIONAL CENTERS ABOUT WHAT ARE THEIR STRATEGIES TO ADDRESS ON SOME OF THESE IMPORTANT ISSUES- AS WELL AS MAKING SURE THAT- OUR STAFF HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ATTEND. EVERY SINGLE REGIONAL CENTER- BOARD MEETING COMMUNITY MEETING WHETHER IT'S ON DISPARITIES COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT- STARTING TO ATTEND- SOME OF THE LOCAL ADVISORY COMMITTEES ON SELF DETERMINATION SO THE PRESENCE THAT OUR STAFF TO BEING ABLE TO HAVE. HAS BEEN VERY VALUABLE TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THOSE CONNECTIONS WE'VE ALSO RECENTLY HAD A GROUP OF LATINO MOMS THEY HAD SOME VERY SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS ABOUT ACCESSING SERVICES WITH A COUPLE OF REGIONAL CENTERS. SO OUR LAND SONS AND THE STAFF THAT WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO BUILD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MEET WITH THEM ALSO MEET WITH THEIR REGIONAL ENTER SO WE'RE ABLE TO TIME WE ADDRESS THESE ISSUES. WHERE WE DID NOT HAVE THOSE RESOURCES I WILL ALSO SAY THAT THERE'S NO WAY WE COULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PROVIDE THE SUPPORTS IN THE POSSIBILITIES AND THEIR REACTION AND ACTION ITEMS THAT WE HAD IN THIS PANDEMIC. YOU KNOW HOW WE CAN AND NOT BEEN ABLE TO HAVE THOSE RESOURCES. TO DO THAT OUR REACH. SO I AS FAR AS HOW TO. IT I HAVE TO. KIND OF. ENGAGE IN MORE CALM. WITH YOU TO UNDERSTAND KIND OF WERE THE THOUGHT IS- WE'RE STILL AND MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE IDENTIFYING THAT THE BENEFITS OF IT AND ALSO THE AREAS IN WHICH WE CAN IMPROVEMENTS AND UTILIZING THOSE RESOURCES. I WOULD BE HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP OFFLINE WITH THOSE- DID WANT TO ASK ABOUT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE DISPARITIES FUNDING- ARE THERE ANY LESSONS LEARNED THAT WE HAVE. AGAIN HOW DO WE HELP TO APPLY THOSE STATE WIDE. AND CAN THE PENDING EVALUATION BE SPECIFICALLY USED TO HIGHLIGHT THOSE BEST PRACTICES THAT CAN BE EXTENDED ACROSS THE SYSTEM. YES THANK YOU- SO THE THERE'S BEEN SOME BEST PRACTICES THAT HAVE REALLY BEEN IDENTIFIED ONE IS THAT COMMUNITY NAVIGATOR AND- FROM A TORAH MODELS IN USING THOSE TRUSTED ORGANIZATIONS WHEN WE FIRST AT THE ELEVEN MILLION AND HAD THE RESOURCES IT WENT ONLY TO REGIONAL CENTRES- AND I WILL GIVE A SHOUT OUT AGAIN TO MRS GOMEZ BECAUSE THROUGH THE CONVERSATIONS THAT WE HAD WITH THEM. WE HAD REAL HONEST CONVERSATIONS ABOUT HEY YOU KNOW HERE'S ALL THE FUNDING THAT'S AVAILABLE TO ADDRESS SERVICE ACCESS AND EQUITY. BUT YOU'RE HAVING THE RESULTS CENTERS DO THAT YOU KNOW WHAT ABOUT COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS WHAT ABOUT- FAMILIES OR- GROUPS THAT WANT TO DO SOME GRASSROOTS WORK. SO WE HAD SOME GROWING PAINS EARLY ON. AND BUT QUICKLY THE SECOND YEAR WE WENT STRAIGHT INTO COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. YOU KNOW HELP TREAT REALLY LOOKING AT HOW WE CAN USE THOSE TRUSTED NETWORKS TO BE ABLE TO DO THOSE OUT THAT OUTREACH- WE HAVE A JUST A AREAS THAT I THINK WE NEED TO FOCUS ON- WE DO NEED TO FOCUS. ON IT JUST NAY ON BUILDING THE LEADERSHIP WITHIN OUR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR IN THE DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES SYSTEM. YOU KNOW REACHING OUT TO THE AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY AND REACHING OUT TO THE LATINO COMMUNITY YOU KNOW AND HELPING THEM KIND OF BUILD THEIR- POSITION OF LEADERSHIP. AND SO THEY HAVE- IN REALLY A VOICE AT THE TABLE. REMOTE MEETINGS HAS BEEN AN ABSOLUTE- YEAH. YOU KNOW AS MUCH AS I IT'S BEEN DIFFICULT RIGHT NOW WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO CONNECT WITH MORE FAMILIES IN KINDA HERE AND ALSO HERE THE BENEFITS THE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THROUGH THE ELEVEN MILLION. ALSO DID REMARKABLE OUT OF REACH- MAKING SURE FAMILIES ARE GETTING PP AND THEY WERE ABLE TO GET FOOD THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO GET INFORMATION. AND SO THAT'LL HAVE BEEN MILLION HAD BUILT A NETWORK OF COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. YEAH HIS WAS SO CRITICAL YOU'RE RESPONDING AND DOING OUTREACH TO THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED- MICROBIT- SO WE ARE WE ARE CONTINUING TO EVALUATE AND YES ON THAT QUESTION REGARDING THE VALUATION WE CAN DEFINITELY. YOU KNOW TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT ARE THE LESSONS- LEARN WHAT ARE THE STRENGTHS OF THE PROGRAM ONE OF THE AREAS THAT WOULD BE RECOMMENDED- WE DO WANT AN INDEPENDENT- EVALUATION AND THAT WOULD BE ABLE TO DO TO HELP US- GET TO- THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR. A TASK FORCE I'M MORE GROUP ONE SERVICE. ACCESS AND EQUITY TO GIVE US I'M SORRY COMMENDATIONS RISK OF WORK ON. HELP US SEE- WE SHOULD FOCUS. I ARE HIGHLIGHTED ONE OF MISS GOMEZ'S COMMENTS WHERE SHE'S THAT- WORK BUT ONLY IF IMPLEMENTED. I WANTED TO FOLLOW UP THEN WITH WHAT SHE HAD SAID THAT SOME REGIONAL CENTER STATE THAT THE DIRECTIVES ARE SUGGESTIONS. ARE THEY SUGGESTIONS ARE ARE THE DIRECTIVES. YEAH THEIR DIRECTIVES AND ANYTIME THERE'S- QUESTIONS OR INCONSISTENCIES AND REALLY WHAT LED TO OUR PARTICIPANT DIRECTED TRAINING WAS WHAT WE WERE HEARING ABOUT INCONSISTENCIES ARE IMPLEMENTATION- AND SO THAT'S WHY WE WENT AHEAD AND SAID HEY WE JUST NEED TO TAKE SOME ACTION RIGHT NOW AND DO IT OVERALL I'M STATEWIDE TRAINING- SO WE- WANT TO MAKE SURE WE HEAR THOSE CONCERNS YOU KNOW AND- WHILE EACH REGIONAL CENTERS HAVE THEIR OWN POLICIES- THAT ARE DERIVED BASED ON REGULATIONS AND STATUTES- THERE IS TIMES WHEN THERE'S DIFFERENT INTERPRETATIONS- SYSTEMS NOT ALWAYS PERFECT IN BEING ABLE TO NAVIGATE THAT. BUT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HEAR THOSE CONCERNS AND IF WE CAN PROVIDE SOME- SUPPORT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE- WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT AND THAT'S THAT'S HELPFUL TO BE ABLE TO HAVE INPUT SUCH AS THAT AND SHARING. THOSE CONCERNS. ON PAGE FOURTEEN THERE IS THE- DIRECTIVE LOOKING AT FOCUSED CONVERSATIONS BY THE REGIONAL CENTERS AND- WANTED TO. ASK WHAT IS OUR ACCOUNTABILITY TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE THE MOST IMPORTANT CONVERSATIONS. WHAT'S THAT ACCOUNTABILITY LOOK LIKE. SO YOU'RE RIGHT I BELIEVE YOU'RE REFERRING TO THE PLANS THAT WERE ASKING A REGIONAL CENTERS TO HAVE FUN IS THAT CORRECT THAT'S CORRECT. YES SO WE WERE EACH OF THAT THE LIAISONS WILL WORK WITH THEIR pTO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE GETTING THOSE PLANS- AND MAKING SURE THAT THEIR MEANINGFUL PLANS- WE WORK WITH ARCA- AND- PART OF THE BENEFIT OF HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH THE REGIONAL CENTERS ON A FREQUENT BASIS WE- WE SIMPLY ME- ONCE A WEEK IF NOT ONCE A WEEK- WITH MY EXECUTIVE TEAM AND THE REGIONAL CENTER DIRECTORS. TO TALK ABOUT THESE IMPORTANT ISSUES ON THE REGIONAL CENTER DIRECTORS HAVE ALL SAID YES YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE THESE ARE IMPORTANT YOU KNOW IT'S SOMETIMES IT'S CERTAINLY A BURDEN SOMETIMES TO BE ABLE TO SAY LET'S PUT THIS IN WRITING- BUT THEY UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF IT THEY UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF- BEING ABLE TO HAVE A TRANSPARENT TO THE COMMUNITY SO WE'LL WORK WITH- OUR LIAISONS AND THE REGIONAL CENTERS ON TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THOSE PLANS AND TRACK THOSE. ON BUT LIKE I SAID WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO UPDATE WHAT OUR EXPECTATION. IS BASED ON THE ANNOUNCEMENT ON FRIDAY- WITH THAT I- CLOSE THE SECTION BUT BEFORE WE MOVE FORWARD I WOULD LIKE TO REITERATE. THE REQUEST THAT ARE DISCUSSED ON THE AGENDA AND ASK FOR THE FOLLOWING FROM THE ADMINISTRATION. ONE HAD LIKE FOR THAT PUBLIC FACING DATA DASHBOARD ON BAXEEN ACCESS IN THE DDS SERVED POPULATION. TO I'D LIKE A PROPOSED SET OF DIRECTIVES THAT ARE APPROPRIATE TO EXTEND AND CODIFY. FOR THE ADMINISTRATION BY APRIL FIFTH OF THIS YEAR. AND THREE IT'S A SUMMARY OF THOSE REGIONAL CENTER PLANS BY A DATE THAT'S DECIDED MUTUALLY BETWEEN THE ADMINISTRATION AND OUR SUBCOMMITTEE STAFF.

YOUR I FOUND MY PLACE APOLOGIZE FOR THE DELAY- I HAD- FOR THE FIRST QUESTION THAT WAS LISTED FOR ME TO PROVIDE- RESPONSES CHU TO THIS COMMITTEE. I'VE HAD TO DO WITH THE PROVIDER NETWORK INSTALLED GO AHEAD AND JUST SUMMARIZE THAT AGAIN AND- I ADDRESS MOST OF THAT- WITH THAT QUESTION THAT ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRAZIER HAD PUT FORWARD- BUT JUST TO REITERATE AND WE HAD- BASED ON OUR CLAIMS DATA AND AGAIN. THAT'S THE MECHANISM FOR BILLING AND- IT DOESN'T SHOW THE NUMBER OF PROVIDERS BUT IT DOES SHOW KIND OF THOSE- NUMBER OF. KIND OF VENDORS THAT ARE OR BILLING WITHIN THE DIFFERENT- SERVICES- WE HAD ABOUT TWENTY TWO THOUSAND PROVIDERS FOR THE PERIOD BETWEEN JULY TWENTY NINETEEN TWO FEBRUARY TWENTY TWENTY SO THAT WAS BEFORE THE PANDEMIC. AND THEN- JUST SHY OF. TWENTY TWO THOUSAND SO. AGAIN OF BOB OUT HUNDRED PROVIDE LAST FOR THE PERIOD OF JULY. TWO DECEMBER TWENTY TWENTY I'M I WISH THAT WE HAD- FURTHER DETAIL REGARDING THE EMPLOYEES WE DON'T HAVE THAT- THAT IS- LIMITATIONS TO THE INFORMATION THAT IS AVAILABLE TO US I'M AND I SAID AS I HAD NOTED THAT WE HAD- ONE THOUSAND FOREIGN FIFTY FOUR VENDORS LAST- THAT HAD BILLED AFTER THE PANDEMIC- AND JUST TO REITERATE THAT THAT WAS- PRIMARILY OUR OUT OF HOME RESPITE PROVIDERS TRANSPORTATION- PROVIDERS AND SUPPLEMENTAL STAFFING BUT WE DID SEE- KINDA. INCREASE THIS INCREASE OF PROVIDERS AND- CLEANING AND THAT THE CURRENT YEAR PRIMARILY BECAUSE WE STARTED SEEING ADDITIONAL SUPPLEMENTAL STAFFING- I'M I WAS ALSO ASKED TO TALK TO SPECIFIC DYNAMICS WITHIN THE SETTING TYPES THAT- I WANT WOULD WANT TO POINT OUT AND I DID THAT EARLIER YOU KNOW CERTAINLY CONCERNED ABOUT- OUR OUT OF HOME RESPITE PROVIDERS- BUT WE'RE ALSO WANTING TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION WITH TRANSPORTATION PROVIDERS INTO. HOW TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE FITTING WITHIN THE ALTERNATIVE SERVICES- I WILL ALSO NOTE THAT- OUR SUPPORTED LIVING PROVIDERS AND WHILE THIS MAY NOT BE SPECIFIC QUESTION- BUT THEY HAD TAKEN ON A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES AND YOU KNOW ALL OF OUR PROVIDERS- HAD JUST DONE A REMARKABLE JOB IN PROVIDING SUPPORTS TO INDIVIDUALS AND SOME VERY VERY CHALLENGING SITUATIONS. AND GETTING VERY CREATIVE I'M PARTICULARLY PROUD OF THE FACT THAT WE HAVE A TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TEAM- OR- PROVIDERS THAT WE HAD DESIGNED TO HELP- PROVIDERS IN ALTERNATIVE SERVICES TO THINK ABOUT HOW TO GET CREATED AND PROVIDE CONTENT THIS VISION THAT YOU CAN THINK OUTSIDE OF THE BOX- SO APPRECIATE EASTER SEALS AND CDSA AND- I KNOW THE ARC IS A PART OF THAT TEAM AND THE WORK. THAT THEY'VE BEEN DOING IN DOING THAT THE LEFT ON HEALTH PEOPLE OUTSIDE THE BOX I THINK IT'S ALL VERY. SO FOR THOSE PROVIDERS THAT ARE STRUGGLE AT THIS THAT THIS WOULD BE A RESOURCE I'M SO HAPPY THAT- YES SIR ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS I THINK THOSE ARE THE TWO ITEMS THAT I HAD. FOR MY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU DIRECTOR BIRDMAN NEXT WE HAVE JIM KNIGHT DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES. HI GOOD AFTERNOON DOCTOR ARAMBULA- COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND STAFF I AM JIM LIKE THE DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES. SO I'M-GONNA START WITH EVEN AN UPDATE ON WHERE WE ARE IN THE STATUS OF MEDIAN DOWNHOLE THE FEDERAL HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES REQUIREMENTS. THE THEY'RE KNOWN BY A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT NAMES AND SO OFTEN REFERRED TO AS A STRANGE REQUIREMENTS BECAUSE THEY- THEY DO- SETS A NEW- RULES OR REGULATIONS AROUND HOW SERVICES ARE COORDINATED. AND IN PARTICULAR WHAT PEOPLE'S EXPERIENCES WHAT CHOICES THEY HAVE AND THEN OR DO THOSE SERVICES AND SUPPORT COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION. SO I'M GONNA TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE KEY POINTS THAT WERE OUTLINED IN OUR TRANSITION PLAN WHICH WE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE AND THAT IS A REQUIREMENT OF THE SETTING REQUIREMENTS AS WELL THAT WE HAVE INITIAL APPROVAL OF THIS. TRANSITION PLAN THROUGH THE FEDERAL CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES ALTHOUGH WE STILL HAVE SOME MORE TO GO TO GET FINAL APPROVAL ON THAT. ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS THAT WE NEED TO DO IS REALLY DO AN ASSESSMENT OF WHERE WE ARE AND WHERE THOSE SETTINGS ARE PROVIDERS ARE. IN MEETING THE REQUIREMENTS AND SO- OVER THE SUMMER WE- COMPLETED THE FIRST STEP OF THAT WHICH IS A PROVIDER SELF ASSESSMENT. TO WEAR OF THAT IS AS THE NAME WOULD SUGGEST WHERE- PROVIDERS GO THROUGH AN INJURY WITH WITH THE DIFFERENT REQUIREMENTS IN THAT SET THE STAGE REQUIREMENTS AND IDENTIFY. WHETHER THEY NEED THOSE THOSE REQUIREMENTS AND IF NOT. START TO IDENTIFY SOME SOME THINGS THAT CAN BE DONE TO IT TO ADDRESS AND CHANGE THAT. NOW THIS SELF ASSESSMENT PROCESS IS REALLY- MEARS AND- ALTHOUGH A LITTLE MORE IN DEPTH. THAN WHAT WE'VE DONE OVER THE PREVIOUS FEW YEARS WITH. HELP FROM FUNDING IN THE BUDGET. DENTIST OF THAT THERE BE SOME SUPPORT ACTORS. AND THEN. MONEY NEEDED FOR PROVIDERS TO MAKE SOME CHANGES TO MEET THESE REQUIREMENTS- THE INITIAL RESULTS OF THE SELF ASSESSMENT SHOWED THAT 67% OF THE PROVIDERS REPORTED THAT THEY WERE MEETING ALL THE REQUIREMENTS. AND OBVIOUSLY THAT MEANS THAT 33% OF THE STATE STILL NEEDED TO MAKE SOME CHANGES THE RESULTS OF THESE AND A SUMMARY OF THE RESULTS ARE POSTED ON THE DEPARTMENT'S WEBSITE. AND AS REQUIRED BY STATE STATUTE WILL CONTINUE TO UPDATE THAT PERIODICALLY WITH THE NEXT UPDATE IS DUE- I BELIEVE NEXT MONTH. IN MARCH. SO THE NEXT STEP WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE THOSE INITIAL- PROVIDER OF SELF ASSESSMENTS. THAT WAS FOR ALL APPLICABLE PROVIDERS THEN NEXT IN WHAT WE'VE STARTED DOING IS AS OUTLINED IN THE TRANSITION PLAN IS AN ON SITE ASSESSMENT. SO THAT'S WHERE A SAMPLE OF PROVIDERS NATURALLY TO VALIDATE. THE RESULT OF THOSE- PROVIDER SELF ASSESSMENTS SO WE'VE ENGAGED A CONTRACTOR TO HELP ASSIST TO HELP THE JUSTICE THAN THAT- ALWAYS FEEL WE CALLED ON SITE ASSESSMENTS- IN OUR TRANSITION PLAN WE'VE HAD TO CHANGE THAT- WE STARTED IN PILOTED- WITH. ABOUT A HUNDRED TWENTY PROVIDERS JOINED- VIRTUAL OR REMOTE ASSESSMENT. TO WALK THROUGH THE AND IDENTIFY WHERE PROVIDERS ARE IT AND THEN COMPARING THAT TO WHAT THEIR SELF ASSESSMENTS SAID AS WELL WE JUST COMPLETED THAT INITIAL PILOT PHASE HERE JUST pWEEKS. AND SO WE'RE WE'RE NOW TRYING TO ASSESS WHAT THE RESULTS OF THOSE ARE IN AND WHAT CHANGES WERE MADE TO MAKE. TO GO FORWARD AND- FOR THE REST OF THE PROVIDERS THAT NEED TO DO THAT SO ULTIMATELY WE'RE LOOKING AT. THINKING THAT WE'RE GONNA NEED ABOUT TWELVE HUNDRED- OF THESE. ON SITE SLASH VIRTUAL ASSESSED. AS OUTLINE IN OUR TWO. PLAN SO IN ADDITION TO THAT AS DOES ASSESSMENT ACTIVITIES- ANOTHER BIG COMPONENT WAS TRANSITION PLAN AS ONGOING INFORMATION SHARING RATHER BE THROUGH TRAINING- AND THE LIKE FOR- PEOPLE WHO RECEIVE SERVICES THEIR FAMILIES PROVIDERS AND REGIONAL CENTERS AS WELL AS A WE'VE BEEN CONTINUING TO DO THAT AND WILL CONTINUE THEIR- UPCOMING ABOUT THE STRANGE REQUIREMENTS- WITHIN REAL. EXTRA EMPHASIS ON PERSON CENTERED PLANNING AND PRACTICES SINCE THIS REALLY THAT FORMS THE BASIS OF THE OF THE STANDINGS REQUIREMENTS. UNDER THE HOME IF YOU MAY SERVICES. SO IN SUMMARY EVEN THOUGH THERE HAVE BEEN A COUPLE OF DELAYS AND WE'VE HAD TO MAKE SOME CHANGES WITH- DUE TO THE PANDEMIC. WE STILL ON TRACK TO MEET THE FEDERALLY REQUIRED- MARCH TWENTY TWENTY THREE DEADLINE FOR GETTING A FINAL APPROVAL OF THE TRANSITION PLAN THAT TALKED ABOUT EARLIER. AND JUST TO AT A HIGH LEVEL THE REQUIREMENTS TO GET FINAL APPROVAL OF THAT TRANSITION PLAN. OR FOR A STATE SOME OF THINGS THAT NEED TO BE INCLUDED IN THAT AS IS AN ESTIMATE. OF THE NUMBER OF SETTINGS PROVIDERS. THAT ARE MEETING THE REQUIREMENTS. LIKEWISE IN THE- NUMBER OF STANDING DURING ESTIMATES. THAT ARE CURRENTLY MEETING THOSE REQUIREMENTS AND THEN WHAT STEPS WE'RE GOING TO TAKE TO. TO MEET THOSE REQUIREMENTS BOTH IN THE BALLOT AND THEN ALSO WHAT OUR SYSTEM IS FOR ONGOING OVERSIGHT. SO NEXT ON A TOUCH ON OF WHERE WE ARE WITH IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SELF DETERMINATION PROGRAM. AND JUST FOR- TO START WITH CURRENTLY IN WELL ACTUALLY AS OF THE NINTH OF FEBRUARY WE HAVE FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE TRANSITIONED AND YOUR- STUFF TO TERMINATION. COMPARISON ONLY TAKE ABOUT A YEAR AGO SO AT THE BEGINNING OF TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY. THERE WERE JUST OVER A HUNDRED PEOPLE WHO HAD MADE THAT TRANSITION AND MOST OF THOSE WERE- INDIVIDUALS WHO HAD BEEN PURCHASED BENSON THE FORMER SELF DETERMINATION PILOT PROJECT. SO IT'S BEEN. A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE- SENSE THAT THEY'RE STILL OBVIOUSLY WORK WORK SHOULD TWO ZERO AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT HERE AND THE SECOND. SO AND I KNOW ONE OF THE QUESTIONS WAS WHAT'S BEEN THE IMPACT OF KOBE AND WHILE IT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFICULT TO SAY EXACTLY- SPECIFICALLY WHAT'S- FOR SELF DETERMINATION WHAT THAT. IMPACT IS BANNED. YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO ADD SOME. REPORTS THAT IN FACT BECAUSE OF THE FLEXIBILITY IS THAT SELF DETERMINATION OFFERS IT'S ACTUALLY ISN'T THAT TRANSITION FOR SOME INDIVIDUALS SIXTEEN THAT IS A WAY TO HELP ADDRESS SOME OF THE CHANGING NEEDS. THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT ON BY THE PANDEMIC. CONVERSELY WE WE'VE HEARD ACTUALLY SOMETIMES JUST THE OPPOSITE BECAUSE OF EVERYTHING THAT'S GOING ON WITH THE PANDEMIC. IN PEOPLE'S LIVES THAT IS ACTUALLY KINDA IT'S SLOWED THINGS DOWN A BIT. SO IT IT'S DIDN'T STAND A LITTLE BIT OF BOTH WELL LIKE I SAID THERE HAS BEEN A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE WHEN YOU LOOK AT. YEAR OVER YEAR- WHAT WE'RE SEEING NOW IN THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE HAVE TRANSITION. SO MONEY SAID WELL THAT PACE HAS INCREASED WE DO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE'S IMPROVEMENTS ARE STILL NEEDED IN MAY. AND LUCKILY WE HAVE- THE HELP OF A LOT OF. INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS AND ONE OF LIKE SAY IS THAT. IN USE ME IN AUGUST. WE DID GET- SOME OF THE VERY DETAILED LIST OF RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE STATE WIDE SELF DETERMINATION BEISER COMMITTEE. IN A NUMBER OF THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS. FOR IMPROVEMENT HAVE BEEN AND TO LET. AND THEN WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE PARTNERSHIP WITH THIS GROUP AND OTHERS AS WE DEVELOP AN IMPLEMENTATION PLAN THAT'S- REFERENCED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THAT'S GONNA HAVE SPECIFIC STEPS AND STRATEGIES TO ACHIEVE THE GOALS OF THE PROGRAM. AND IN ADDITION TO ASSIST WITH THAT. WE LOOK FOR SOME EXPERTISE AND SOME OTHER ASSISTANCE BOTH WITHIN THE STATE AND NATIONALLY TO HELP SUPPORT THAT. SO SOME OF THE NATIONAL EXPERTS SO WE HAD WE DONE THIS THROUGH AGREEMENT WITH THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES- BEEN ABLE TO ENLIST THE HELP OF AN ORGANIZATION WE'RE- KNOWN AS THE PLIGHTS OF DIRECTION THAT HAS EXPERTISE AND- HELPING WITH SELF DETERMINATION PROGRAMS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY AS WELL AS- MY OWN. EXPERTS FROM THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES DIRECTORS- SO WE'RE VERY FORTUNATE TO HAVE OF THEIR PARTNERSHIP AS WELL AS- CATHERINE BLAKE MOORE WHOSE BAND- INTIMATELY INVOLVED WITH IN CALIFORNIA- IN SELF DETERMINATION FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND SO WITH THE SUPPORT OF ALL THOSE AND OTHERS. YOU REALLY DO LOOK FORWARD TO JEFF PRESENTING A PLAN THAT THAT SUPPORTS A BROADER AND EFFECTIVE IMPLEMENTATION OF. OF SELF DETERMINATION MOVING FORWARD- SO THE NEXT COUPLE QUESTIONS ARE ABOUT- THAT CHALLENGES AND THE PRIORITIES AND IN RELATION TO THE PROVIDER NETWORK AND I KINDA WANT TO. ADDRESS THOSE TOGETHER BECAUSE I DO THINK THERE. THERE IS WIND- YOU KNOW FIRST AND FOREMOST WE TALK ABOUT CHALLENGES AND PRIORITIES FOR THAT WE REALLY DO. WANT TO EMPHASIZE SAFETY AND IN THE DELIVERY AND RECEIPT OF SERVICES AND NOT JUST FROM THE PROVIDER PERSPECTIVE. BUT ALSO FOR PEOPLE WHO RECEIVE SERVICES AND THEIR FAMILIES AND THOSE THEY LIVE WITH. SO WE HEARD EARLIER ABOUT. THE NUMBER OF THINGS THAT ARE AND STRATEGIES ARE GOING ON WITH. FROM PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT TO ACCESS TO TESTING AND VACCINES IT CERTAINLY. MR NINETY ONE ON MUTE FOR A SECOND. SORRY ABOUT THAT. SO WE DO HAVE THAT TO LOOK TO SOME OF THE THING IS SAFETY THAT- WITH THE ACCESS TO A PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT- TESTING IMPACT SEEMS TO REALLY ENHANCE THE SAFETY SO THAT FOLKS THAT ARE RECEIVING SERVICES- CAN DO SO SAFELY AND DOLLARS ARE PROVIDED THEM AS WELL. AND AGAIN WE TALK ABOUT THE CHALLENGES AND PRIORITIES THAT OF THE PROVIDER NETWORK WE HAVE TO START WITH WHAT ARE THE NEEDS OF PERFECT. LOVE SHE RECEIVED SERVICE AT AND I HAVE TO INFORM US AS WE MOVE FORWARD TRYING TO BUILDING AND MAINTAINING THAT- PROVIDER NETWORK AS WELL. JONES ALSO AS NOTED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WE ARE CURRENTLY WORKING WITH STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING OUR CONSUMER ADVISORY COMMITTEE AND DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES TASK FORCE. AND TO LOOK AT WHAT IS THE SERVICE OPTIONS DURING THE PANDEMIC AND BEYOND AND GET SOME RECOMMENDATIONS ON POTENTIAL SHORT AND LONG TERM CHANGES. YEAH WE MENTIONED EARLIER IN IN THE AGENDA NUMBER OF PEOPLE TALK ABOUT WE NEED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF WHAT WE LEARNED DURING THE PANDEMIC. AND HELPED SHAPE WHAT THINGS ARE GOING TO LOOK LIKE LONG TERM CERTAINLY THINGS THAT THAT DIRECTOR BARGE IN AND OTHERS HAVE MENTIONED- SOME OF THOSE THINGS ARE INCREASING THAT ACCESS TO PARTICIPANT DIRECTED SERVICES. REMOTE DELIVERY OF SERVICE AND ACCESS TO SERVICES AND SOME OTHERS ARE THOSE THAT WE REALLY NEED TO LOOK AT. TO CONTINUE AND CODIFY AS WE MOVE FORWARD. WE REALLY DO NEED TO HAVE A- FOR A PRIORITY A CONTINUED FOCUS ON INDIVIDUAL CHOICE. AND FLEXIBILITY NOT ONLY IN THE WAY THAT SERVICES ARE RECEIVED BUT THE WAY THAT THEY'RE DELIVER. SO WITH THESE AS AS FOCUSED WITH PRIORITIES ARE WORK- IT REALLY HAS TO THEN ICLUDE. WHAT IS THE PAYMENT STRUCTURE AND SERVICE DELIVERY STRUCTURE THAT'S GONNA ENABLE PROVIDERS. TO SUPPORT THOSE OPTIONS AND FLEXIBILITY THAT CONSUMERS AND THEIR FAMILIES WALKED. SO THAT'LL BE A REALLY THE YOU KNOW AS WE MOVE FORWARD REALLY A FOCUS IS TO. ONCE WE IDENTIFY WHAT THE PRIORITIES ARE TO HELP AND IDENTIFY WHAT IT IS THAT WE NEED TO PUT IN PLACE TO- AND PAYMENT STRUCTURES ARE STILL GOING TO BE A BIG PART OF IT. TOO TO SUPPORT THE ONGOING DELIVERY OF SERVICES. AND THEN FINALLY I WANT TO- AND WITH- SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT MINIMUM WAGE SO THAT AS HAS HAPPENED OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS THE MINIMUM WAGE TO INCREASE AGAIN- THIS JANUARY AND SO LIKE WE DONE PREVIOUSLY WE DID PUT OUT. ACTIONS ON ON HOW THAT IS- GOING TO BE IMPLEMENTED IT'S SIMILAR TO WHAT IT'S BEEN DONE AND PREVIOUS YEARS. WHICH FOR THE MOST PART THAT PROVIDERS ARE IN SYMMETRIC QUESTIONS OF THE DEPARTMENT OR REGIONAL CENTER- SO IT WILL TAKE. BECAUSE OF THE TIMING OF WHEN THE MINIMUM WAGE GOES AND- INTO A FACT AND THEN. THE TIME THAT ULTIMATELY ANY RATE CHANGES GET IMPLEMENTED. AND THEN CLAIMS ARE SUBMITTED IT DOES TAKE SEVERAL MONTHS FOR US TO. TO ULTIMATELY GET WHAT IS THE ACTUAL IMPACT OF WHAT DOES THE MINIMUM WAGE INCREASE SAYS. YES I KNOW THE AGENDA DID ASK TO LOOK AT SOME PRIOR YEAR EXPERIENCES. WHAT WE'VE NOTICED INSIDE YOU JUST FOR- EXAMPLE. FOR THE INCREASE THAT TOOK EFFECT IN JANUARY OF TWENTY NINETEEN. THE ESTIMATED ANNUAL IMPACT FOR THE SUBSEQUENT FISCAL YEAR WAS ESTIMATED IN THE BUDGET TO BE. ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FORTY EIGHT MILLION. WHEREAS WHEN WE LOOK BACK ON THE ACTUAL EXPENDITURES WE SEE THAT THAT WAS ABOUT EIGHTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS AN ACTUAL EXPENDITURES. SIMILARLY FOR THE MINIMUM WAGE INCREASE THAT TOOK EFFECT IN JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY. THE ESTIMATED ANNUAL IMPACT WAS A HUNDRED NINETY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. AND THE ACTUAL- EXPENDITURES THAT WE'VE SEEN SO FAR- WHERE IT IS A LITTLE OVER A HUNDRED SEVEN NAY. SO WITH THIS CURRENT MINIMUM WAGE AND INCREASE- WE WILL AND SEVERAL MONTHS IN A LIKELY BE AFTER THEM THAT THE THIS BUDGET IS ENACTED A LITTLE BETTER IDEA OF WHAT WE'RE SEEING- THE IMPACT IS THIS TIME AND- AS WE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE THERE ARE SOME. THINGS THAT MAKE THAT CHALLENGING FOR US TO ATTEMPT TO- ESTIMATE THE IMPACT IN ONE OF THOSE IS AS- DIRECTOR BARGMANN MENTIONED EARLIER TO AS A WEEK. WE DON'T HAVE INFORMATION ON THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES. THAT PROVIDERS HAVE AND THEIR- IN THEIR SALARIES AS WELL. DO IT AT ALL AND MY COMMENTS. THANK YOU MR NIGHT NEXT WE HAVE- STEVEN PAVLOV DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. I THINK YOU CHAIR STEVEN PAUL MCCORMACK FINANCE FINANCE WITH US- THREE QUESTIONS THE FIRST WHICH I'VE BEEN WAS- WHAT IS THE RATIONALE FOR THIS INSPECTION POLICY RECOMMENDED YES SO WELL KNOWN PROVIDER RATES. SO GIVEN THE FORECASTED STRUCTURAL IMBALANCE IN THE MULTI YEAR THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES TO SUSPEND THE HOME LOAN RATES ON DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TWO. THE SPECIAL TO BE LEFT THAT IF THEY MINISTRATION SERMONS THROUGH THE TWENTY TWENTY TO BUDGET ACT PROCESSES THAT THEY'RE SUFFICIENT GENERAL FUND REVENUE SUPPORT AUSTIN PROGRAMS AND SUBSEQUENT TO FISCAL YEARS. SO THESE CHANGES REFLECT A SIMILAR APPROACH ADOPTED BY THE ADMINISTRATION ON LEGISLATION PRIOR BUDGETS YOU KNOW HOW WE HANDLE THAT ARE YOUR SHORTFALL IN THE NEED FOR SERVICE PROVISION IS CERTAINLY DIFFICULT QUESTION AND WE- WELCOME ONGOING DISCUSSIONS WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON. THE ISSUE ABOUT THE BUDGET PROCESS. THE NEXT ONE. WAS WHAT WOULD BE THE END OF THE SUSPENSION PURSUANT TO THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IF IT TOOK PLACE DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TWO. SO THE FUNDING FOR THE PURCHASE OF SERVICES- WOULD BE REDUCED HOWEVER THE FUNNY WOULD NOT RETURN TO INCREASE OF WOMEN ALREADY- INCREASED LEVELS. BECAUSE OF SUBSEQUENT FUNDING HAS BEEN PROVIDED FOR A CASELOAD AND UTILIZATION AS WELL AS SB THREE MINIMUM WAGE ADJUSTMENTS THAT WE JUST DISCUSSED. AND LASTLY- HOW WOULD PROVIDERS LIKELY RESPONSE TO THIS APPREHENSION AROUND LOSS OF. THE RATE INCREASE IN IN GERMANY. OF TIME. I WOULD SAY THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS SENSITIVE TO THE STABILITY OF THE PROVIDER NETWORK I WOULD MEAN INVESTMENTS. AND SUPPLEMENT PROVIDER RATES IN THE UNIFORM HOLIDAY SCHEDULE IN THE PAST THREE YEARS AND POSTED USE AGAIN FOR AN ADDITIONAL YEAR. FORMER THE SITUATION OUR INITIATION SAY CAN IMMEDIATE ACTION THIS YEAR TO MEDINA PROVIDER NETWORK BY REIMBURSING PROVIDERS FOR ALTERNATIVE SERVICES DURING THE PANDEMIC. ALONG WITH PROVIDING OTHER CLOVER NINETEENTH LOOKS AS THOUGH HE'S- SO WILL CONTINUE EXAMINING NEEDS OF. AND WELCOME DISCUSS ON THIS IS. THANK YOU NEXT WE HAVE SUNNY PADDOCK WITH THE LEAD ANALYST'S OFFICE. THANK YOU DOCTOR AMBULANCE THIS IS SONYA PADDOCK AGAIN FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE I WE WERE ASKED TO PROVIDE OUR OFFICES OBSERVATIONS AND QUESTIONS ABOUT THE SUSPENSION POLICY THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE JUST- I WENT THROUGH. WE WOULD NOTE THAT THE- THAT THE GOVERNOR'S NEW PROPOSAL TO- TO THE EXTENT TO I'M SORRY TO IMPLEMENT A NEW SUSPENSION CALCULATION COULD POTENTIALLY LEAD TO SUSPENSIONS AS OF DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TWO WHICH AS NOTED IS ONE YEAR LATER THAN. IS CURRENTLY- IN STATUTE- WE NOTE HOWEVER THAT THESE THE SUSPENSION IS REALLY AFFECT CORE ONGOING PROGRAMS ACROSS HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES- POLICY AREAS INCLUDING MEDIC CAL IN HOME SUPPORTIVE SERVICES AND IN DDS. THIS REALLY CREATES UNCERTAINTY FOR PROVIDERS MAKES IT HARD FOR THEM TO BUDGET AND PLAN IT MAKES IT HARD FOR THEM TO HIRE AND RETAIN STAFF- THE L. A- WOULD RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE REJECT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL- TO INCLUDE NEW SUSPENSION LANGUAGE IN THE BUDGET ACROSS. HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES PROGRAMS. THE SECOND QUESTION WE ARE ASKED TO ADDRESS IS WHAT ARE WE HEARING ABOUT THE SUSTAINABILITY OF THE PROVIDER NETWORK AND ARE THERE ANY ADDITIONAL ACTION STEPS FOR THE STATE TO TAKE TO ENSURE THAT THE NETWORK IS ABLE TO SERVE THE DDS POPULATION POST PANDEMIC. I'D LIKE TO FIRST START BY THANKING- THE VARIOUS SERVICE PROVIDERS AND SERVICE PROVIDER ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE GIVEN OUR OFFICE A LOT OF TIME TO- GO OVER THESE ISSUES WITH US AND WE'VE BEEN TALKING WITH A NUMBER OF THEM ON AND ON A REGULAR BASIS THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC AND I'M REALLY GRATEFUL. TO THEM FOR THEIR TIME- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE HEARD CONSISTENTLY IS THAT THERE IS A COINCIDENCE STRAIN ON THE RESIDENTIAL- SERVICE AND SUPPORT PROVIDERS. WHILE THERE IS- AT THE SAME TIME A SORT OF SLACK ON THE NON RESIDENTIAL SERVICE PROVIDERS WHO ARE LIMITED IN PROVIDING SERVICES BECAUSE OF THE PHYSICAL DISTANCING REQUIREMENTS- AND SO THIS IS A CREATED A UNIQUE SITUATION WHERE THERE MAY BE SOME BURN OUT AMONG- STAFF PROVIDING RESIDENTIAL AND- IN HOME SUPPORTS- WHILE ON THE NONRESIDENTIAL SIDE- THEIR NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO YOU KNOW WOULD LIKE TO HAVE ADDITIONAL HOURS AND WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THEIR SUPPORTS. ANOTHER KEY THING THAT WE DO THAT OUR OFFICE HAS BEEN HEARING IS THAT THE VARIETY OF UNCERTAINTY EARLY IN THE SYSTEM IS MAKING THINGS CHALLENGING ON FOR THE PROVIDER NETWORK SO FOR EXAMPLE- THE POTENTIAL SUSPENSION OF THE SUPPLEMENTAL READING CREASES AS WE JUST DISCUSSED HAS BEEN A NOTED TO OUR OFFICE- IN ADDITION AS ALREADY DISCUSSED IN THE HEARING TODAY. THE SORT OF INCONSISTENT IMPLEMENTATION OF DTS DIRECTIVES ACROSS REGIONAL. CENTERS HAS ALSO AFFECTED- NOT JUST FAMILY ANDINDIVIDUALS SERVED ALSO ANOTHER PROVIDER NETWORK- IN ADDITION AS ALSO DISCUSSED THE DURATION OF THE FLEXIBILITIES ALLOWED- THAT HAS ALSO BEEN AN ISSUE THE THIRTY DAY RENEWALS HAS CREATED SOME UNCERTAINTY. AND THEN THE LACK OF INFORMATION ABOUT ULTIMATE RATE REFORM OR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RATE STUDY HAS BEEN AN ISSUE RAISED TO OUR OFFICE. WE'VE ALSO HEARD THAT OVER THE COURSE OF THE PANDEMIC SOME PROVIDERS HAVE Y. STAFF DUE TO THINGS LIKE- IN IN ADDITION TO SORT OF THE REGULAR REASONS THAT A PROVIDER MIGHT LOSE STAFF- DURING THE PANDEMIC SOME PROVIDERS OF LOS STAFF DUE TO FAMILIAL OBLIGATIONS SUCH AS DEALING WITH THEIR- CHILDREN NOT BEING IN SCHOOL- OR DUE TO MEDICAL CONDITIONS INCLUDING COVERT NINETEEN. SO I JUST OFFER A FEW THOUGHTS ON ON POTENTIAL ACTION STEPS AND SEVERAL OF THESE HAVE ALREADY BEEN DISCUSSED TODAY SO I'M NOT GONNA SPEND A LOT OF TIME THERE BUT- YOU KNOW EXTENDING SOME OF THE DIRECTIVES FOR MORE THAN THIRTY DAYS AT A TIME- COULD BE HELPFUL TO REDUCE UNCERTAINTY. AND AS I ALREADY MENTIONED REJECTING THE SUPPOSE OF I'M SORRY REJECTING THE PROPOSED SUSPENSION LANGUAGE- COULD HELP- WITHTHE SUSTAINABILITY OF THE PER PROVIDER NETWORK- YOU EVER. THE ADMINISTRATION TO COMMENT ON ITS LONG TERM STRATEGY- IN TERMS OF RATE REFORM AND OR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RATE STUDY- AND IT WOULD ALSO BE HELPFUL THAT. THE DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN- REQUIRING PROVIDERS TO SUBMIT THE INFORMATION- PARTICULARLY IN THE AREA OF ALTERNATIVE SERVICES AND NON RESIDENTIAL SERVICES. TO SUBMIT INFORMATION ABOUT HOW THEY'RE DELIVERING SERVICES AND- I WOULD THINK IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA TO INCLUDE MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE NUMBER OF STAFF- THAT THEY HAVE RETAINED OR LOST SO THAT THE- THE LEGISLATURE. HAS MORE INFORMATION ABOUT WHETHER LOTS OF STAFF IS GOING TO BE A SERIOUS PROBLEM POST PANDEMIC. THE LAST QUESTION WE'VE BEEN ASKED TO ADDRESS OUR POTENTIAL IDEAS FOR THE FOR HOW THE DDS BUSINESS MODEL COULD CHANGE AS A RESULT OF LESSONS LEARNED IN THE PANDEMIC- THAT COULD IMPROVE QUALITY OF SERVICES ACCESS TO SERVICES OR ADDRESS DISPARITIES IN THE SYSTEM. SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT- MISTER NIGHT- MENTIONED IS AND SEVERAL OTHER PEOPLE MENTION TODAY IS THAT THE PANDEMIC HAS RESULTED IN. INCREASED ARM FLEXIBILITY IN SERVICE PROVISION AS WELL AS A MORE PERSON CENTERED APPROACH TO DETERMINE. WHAT EACH INDIVIDUAL NEEDS AND CAN HANDLE. I'M AND WE THINK THAT NOT ONLY COULD SOME OF THOSE LESSONS BE APPLIED OUTSIDE OF THE SCOPE OF CONTEXT BUT IT COULD ALSO HELP THE STATE AND MOVING TOWARD EACH CBS COMPLIANCE- AT THE SAME TIME THE MORE FLEXIBLE AND INDIVIDUALIZED APPROACH TO SERVICE DELIVERY DURING THE PANDEMIC HAS RAISED SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW TO DEFINE AND BILL FOR PARTICULAR SERVICES. SO THERE IS SORT OF AN OPPORTUNITY RIGHT NOW TO CONSIDER THINGS LIKE THE SERVICE CODE STRUCTURE- THE CURRENT PROCESS USED TO THE HEALTH AND SAFETY WAIVER PROCESS THAT USED TO ACCOUNT FOR SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES. AND JUST THE NOTION OF THESE HIGHLY INDIVIDUALIZED- SERVICE PLANS- FOR PEOPLE AND THEN THE LAST THING I WOULD JUST MENTION WHICH IT SOUNDS LIKE THE- THE DEPARTMENT IS ALREADY. WELL ON ITS WAY TO YOU TRYING TO PUT THIS INTO A REGULATIONS OR OR MAKE IT A MORE LONG TERM OPTION IS JUST TO- CONSIDER THE ADDITIONAL CATEGORIES OF PARTICIPANT DIRECTED SERVICES- WE ALSO THINK THAT- AS THE STATE'S ROLLING OUT THE SELF DETERMINATION PROGRAM THIS IS AN INTERESTING AREA OF POLICY BECAUSE IT MIGHT PROVIDE SOME. GREATER AMOUNT OF CONTROL TO THE FAMILIES AND- CONSUMERS WHO DON'T NECESSARILY WANT TO GO THE ROUTE OF SELF DETERMINATION BUT WOULD LIKE A GREATER SAY IN SOME OF THEIR SERVICES. SO FINALLY IN JUST GOING TO COMMENT ON THE DISPARITIES ISSUES AND- MAYBE WHAT'S BEEN LEARNED DURING THE PANDEMIC THAT COULD HELP LATER ON. SO AS WE ALL KNOW THAT- STATEWIDE THE PANDEMIC HAS REALLY EXACERBATED SOME OF THE PRE EXISTING RACIAL AND ETHNIC DISPARITIES IN THE STATE. AND WE KNOW THAT INDIVIDUALS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES ALSO FACE THEIR OWN SET OF DISPARITIES. AND THESE ISSUES CAN REALLY BE COMPOUNDED FOR A PERSON OF COLOR WHO HAS A DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY. SO JUST FOR A MOMENT LOOKING OUTSIDE OF DDS THE ADMINISTRATION HAS MADE SOME EFFORTS TO REDUCE THE SERIOUS ADVERSE EFFECTS OF THE PANDEMIC ON PARTICULAR. POPULATIONS WE YOU KNOW THERE ARE STILL A VERY DISPROPORTIONATE NUMBERS OF CASES AND DEATHS ACROSS THE STATE BUT THERE HAVE BEEN SOME TARGETED EFFORTS TO ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE ISSUES. SO FOR EXAMPLE THE ADMINISTRATION HAS TRIED TO INCREASE ITS EFFORTS TO REACH PEOPLE SERVE QUORUM COURT WHERE THEY ARE SO IN OTHER WORDS- THIS MIGHT INCLUDE YOU KNOW THE A BETTER TRANSLATION OF MATERIALS TARGETED AWARENESS CAMPAIGNS HIRING CONTACT TRACERS WAS. CULTURAL COMPETENCY OFFERING HOTEL ROOMS FOR QUARANTINING FOR PEOPLE WHO MAYBE DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO SELF ISOLATE. SO- THERE LIKE LESS THAT CA BE TAKE FROM THESE EFFORTS AND APPLIED OUTSIDE OF BOTH THE PANDEMIC EXPERIENCE AS WELL AS WITH IN THE DDS. SYSTEM WE HAVE ACTUALLY RECOMMENDED TO THE LEGISLATURE THAT IT FUND A COMPREHENSIVE AFTER ACTION REVIEW OF THE STATE'S RESPONSE TO COPE IN NINETEEN THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. IN IN ADDITION THE ADMINISTRATION HAS PROPOSED TO THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY TO CONDUCT AN EQUITY FOCUSED RETROSPECTIVE STUDY. THESE STUDIES REALLY SHOULD BOTH INCLUDE THE DISABILITY COMMUNITY- SPECIFICALLY AND- WOULD HOPEFULLY PROVIDE SOME IMPORTANT LESSONS ABOUT REACHING CALIFORNIA'S DIVERSE COMMUNITIES TO MITIGATE DISPARITIES. AND FINALLY- IN TERMS OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL TO IMPLEMENT A COMMUNITY NAVIGATOR- SPENT I'M SORRY COMMUNITY NAVIGATOR PROGRAMS STATEWIDE- WE WOULD RECOMMEND THAT THE ADMINISTRATION CONSIDER. A FORMAL EVALUATION OF THIS EFFORT AND THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT WOULD BE TO REALLY BUILD IN THAT THE COMPONENTS THAT WOULD BE NECESSARY FROM THE OUTSET TO CONDUCT A FORMAL EVALUATION. SO THAT CONCLUDES MY COMMENTS THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU NEXT WE HAVE ERIC SEGMENT EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR. FOR THE GOLDEN GATE REGIONAL CENTER. THANK THANK YOU DR ARAMBULA- I AM EGGMAN- THE GOLDEN GATE REGIONAL CENTER SERVES SAN MATTEO SAN FRANCISCO AND MARIN COUNTIES THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THE COMMITTEE AND TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS AND YOUR GENDER. OKAY REGIONAL CENTER HAS RESPONDED IN MANY WAYS TO THE PANDEMIC IN TERMS OF PROTECTING THE HEALTH AND WELFARE OF THE PEOPLE WE SERVE. BECAUSE THE COMMITTEE HAS ALREADY HEARD FROM MY COLLEAGUES CARLOS AND LISA ON THE LAST PANEL I WILL ONLY HIGHLIGHTS FIVE WAYS WE HAVE DONE THIS. ALMOST A YEAR AGO G. G. R. C. BEGAN MEETING WITH SEVENTY TWO HUNDRED PROVIDERS SERVICE PROVIDERS EVERY WEEK AND WE'VE BEEN DOING THAT CONSISTENTLY AND WE DID IT YESTERDAY- TO FIGHT THE PANDEMIC WE ESTABLISH AND DEVELOP RELATIONSHIPS WITH LOCAL DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH IN OUR AREA. TO HELP WITH VIRUS OUTBREAKS AND RESPOND TO THOSE AND TO- MAKE TESTING MORE AVAILABLE AND NOW WE ARE WORKING WITH THEM AROUND VACCINES. WE DISTRIBUTED PPVS INITIALLY TO VIRUS OUTBREAK SITES IN THEM TO OUR ENTIRE COMMUNITY STARTING WITH A MAILING IF I'M NOT A BOX OF FIFTY MASKS TO SEVEN THOUSAND FAMILIES- AND TO DATE WE- ARE DISTRIBUTED TWO POINT FIVE MILLION PIECES OF BP. YOU START BY ASKING MESSAGING SYSTEM CALLED EVERBRIDGE IN OUR WEBSITE TO SEND INITIAL AND ONGOING MESSAGES TO EVERYONE IN OUR COMMUNITY FAMILIES INDIVIDUAL SERVICE PROVIDERS. AND OUR OWN STAFF. AND MOST SIGNIFICANTLY WE HAVE USED THE DDS HEALTH AND SAFETY DIRECTIVE TO STABILIZE HOME SUPPORT AND REDUCE THE SPREAD OF THE VIRUS BETWEEN HOMES. IN TERMS OF DIRECTIVES DDS AND IN MANY WAYS DDS HAS TAKEN EXTRAORDINARY EXTRAORDINARY STEPS TO- SUPPORT OUR WORK. WITH THE HEALTH AND SAFETY AUTHORITY. GRANTED REGIONAL CENTERS WE HAVE FUNDED STAFFING CHANGE CHANGE CHANGES THAT HAVE REDUCE THE SPREAD AS I'VE SAID AND SAVE LIVES I BELIEVE AND MOST IMPORTANTLY WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO RECOGNIZE THE HEROIC EFFORTS OF DIRECT CARE STAFF TO REMAIN AN ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL FACE TO FACE CONTACT. WITH THE INDIVIDUALS WE SERVE RISKING THEIR OWN HEALTH AND SAFETY BECAUSE OF THEIR COMMITMENT TO THE INDIVIDUALS THEY SUPPORT AND OFTEN THEY LOVE. MANY OTHER DDS DIRECTIVES HAVE BEEN VERY HELPFUL BUT I WOULD BE REMISS IN MY DUTIES IF I DIDN'T MENTION ONE MORE ASPECT OF PANDEMIC DIRECTIVES. IT IS ONE THING TO DECREE THE DIRECTIVE AT A POLICY LEVEL AS BEFORE TODAY IT IS QUITE ANOTHER TO IMPLEMENT A CONTINUOUS STREAM OF NEW DEMANDS FOR SERVICES AND SUPPORTS ARE BEING DELIVERED. EDS SHOULD BE PRAISED AND HAS BEEN PRAISED HERE IN THIS. HEARING FOR WORKING WITH REGIONAL CENTERS FAMILIES AND PROVIDERS TO GAIN FEEDBACK AND INPUT ON THE CREATION OF MANY DIRECTIVES. THAT HAS HELPED FOR SURE. BUT THE HISTORIC UNDERFUNDING OF REGIONAL CENTER OPERATIONS AND STAFF MAKES IMPLEMENTATION VERY CHALLENGING. IN TERMS OF OTHER CHALLENGES I THINK THE GREATEST CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES COMING OUT OF THE PANDEMIC. WILL BE SHUTTING THE HABIT OF ONLY REACTING TO CRISES. AS A STATE WE NEED TO CLARIFY WHERE WE ARE HEADED AS A SYSTEM. WE NEED SYSTEMIC GOALS TO ALIGN OUR EFFORTS AND MANAGE OUR RESOURCES. NOW THAT WE HAVE FOR ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES CLOSED LARGE INSTITUTIONS. WHAT WILL BE OUR NEW NORTH STAR. SPECIFICALLY IN TERMS OF THE PANDEMIC RELATED CHALLENGES. WE NEED AND ESPECIALLY IN CONSIDERING UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. WE NEED TO STOP LOOKING AT INTERNET ACCESS AS HARDWARE HARDWARE AND UTILITY COSTS AND START LOOKING AT THESE INVESTMENTS AS A NEW METHOD OF TRANSPORTATION. IT IS ANOTHER MEANS OF GETTING SUPPORT. TO BE INDIVIDUALS WE SERVE. SECONDLY WE NEED TO LEARN FROM THOSE WE SERVE IN OUR PROVIDERS WE HAVE IN FRONT OF US I BELIEVE A ONCE IN A. GENERATION OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN FROM REMOTE AND OF ALTERNATIVE SERVICES. AND SONY WAS JUST MENTIONING WE NEED I BELIEVE THE PILOT FROM PROGRAMS THAT WILL BRING PERSON CENTRED SUPPORT INDIVIDUALS WHERE AND WHEN AND HOW. WE NEED THEM FINALLY THE VERY FOUNDATION OF THE ENTITLEMENT RESTS ON DDS REGIONAL CENTERS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS AND HOW WE WORK TOGETHER IN ORDER TO LISTEN TO OUR COMMUNITIES AND RESPOND TO THE INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES WE SERVE. WE AS A STATE CANNOT ACCOMPLISH THIS WITHOUT ADEQUATE RESOURCES TWO YEARS AGO THE STATE MADE CLEAR INVESTMENTS IN TWO PARTS OF THE SUPPORT OF THE SUPPORT SYSTEM YES AS DIRECTOR BARTON WAS MENTIONING WAS FUNDED TO HAVE A AT ITS HEADQUARTERS IN MOST BUT NOT ALL SERVICE PROVIDERS RECEIVED AN EIGHT POINT TWO. PERCENT INCREASE IN THEIR FUNDING. REGIONAL CENTERS HOWEVER HAVE BEEN LEFT TO CONTEND WITH AN EVER INCREASING WORKLOAD BASED ON TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE AND DDS DIRECTIVES WITH INADEQUATE FUNDING SUPPORTING CAPACITY. WE MUST HAVE CASELOADS AND WORKLOADS A REGIONAL CENTER TO MEET ALL THE NEEDS OF ALL THOSE WE SERVE INCLUDING INDIVIDUALS AND UNDERSERVED ETHNIC AND LANGUAGE COMMUNITIES. INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND INDIVIDUALS TRANSITIONING INTO THE SELF DETERMINATION PROGRAM. ALMOST EVERYONE IN OUR COMMUNITY HONESTLY IS EXHAUSTED FROM THE STRESS AND THE CHALLENGES OF THIS PANDEMIC. FAMILIES INDIVIDUALS DIRECT CARE WORKERS DDS STAFF AND REGIONAL CENTER STAFF. BUT WE ARE DOING THE BEST WE CAN TO SUPPORT OUR COMMUNITIES WE ASK THIS COMMITTEE TO SUPPORT ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRAZIER'S REGIONAL CENTER PROVIDER BUDGET. REQUESTS FOR THE FUTURE OF THOSE WE SERVE. I REALLY BELIEVE NOW IS THE TIME FOR YOU TO ACT THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU SIR NEXT WE WILL MOVE ON TO HARRY BROUGH WELL PRESIDENT AND CEO OF PATH POINT. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE COMPARABLE AND YOUNG ONE SERVICE PROVIDER IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. I WAS REQUIREMENTS WHAT IS OUR EXPERIENCES PROVIDERS DURING. WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS THE WATER ARGUES FOR THE FUTURE THE DTS BUSINESS MODEL MY SHORT ANSWERS ARE THANK YOU FOR STAYING IN THE SYSTEM MAINTAIN STABILITY THROUGH THE TRANSITION AND BUILD BETTER. EXPAND ON EACH ONE. IN TERMS OF OUR EXPERIENCE DURING THE PROVIDER WHAT WORKS IS HUGE THANK YOU YES MINISTRATION LEGISLATURE DDS COLLABORATED WITH INDIVIDUAL SERVICE FAMILIES PROVIDERS REGIONAL CENTERS AND OTHERS YOU DON'T HEARD AND THAT WE ARE WORKING IN PARTNERSHIP TO ADDRESS THE- ISSUES. THIS IS. THE FLEXIBILITIES. WORKSTREAM AND HELPFUL. LET'S TURN SERVICES AND REVERSE. NEEDS HELP PEOPLE AND ALLOW FOR INTERNET. HOW ARE ALL SERVICE. THOUSAND OF INDIVIDUALS ARE CONTINUING TO RECEIVE SERVICES OFTEN DEALER TO THEIR SPECIFIC NEEDS WE MANY WONDERFUL STORIES OF HEROES RECEIVING ERRORS PROVIDING SERVICES AND WE RETAIN THE PROVIDER WORKFORCE. WHAT STILL NEEDS ADDRESSING THE REMAINING WORKFORCE CHALLENGES ESPECIALLY WITH RESIDENTIAL PROVIDERS ONE ONE SERVICES SUCH AS SUPPORTED. STAFF AUSTIN IT'S DIFFERENT TO HIRE TURNING SERVICES GYM WORK FOR EVERYONE NEED TO CONTINUE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO SUPPORT EVERYONE INDIVIDUAL NEEDS AND DESIRES AND THERE ARE OTHER THINGS DON'T WORK OUT INCLUDING DEVELOPING AN ACCOUNTABILITY STRUCTURE STREAMLINING BILLING. RATES FOR SOME SERVICE PROVIDER COMMUNITY LOOKS FORWARD TO WORKING ON THE EAST IN COLLABORATION WITH GPS AND ALL STATE. WHAT TO HAPPEN IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS MAINTAIN STABILITY THROUGH THE TRANSITION. REMOVE THE SUSPENSION DATE CURRENTLY FOR SUPPLEMENTAL RATING. AS MENTIONED EARLIER THE SUSPENSION IS CREATING SCIENCE CERTAIN TIME THAT THE SYSTEM NEEDS AS MUCH STABILITY. IT ALSO MAKES IT EXTREMELY DIFFICULT. SUPPORT THE DIRECTOR MARC FORSTER MORE EQUITABLE MEANS THE JUSTIN RATES WHEN STATE MINIMUM WAGE RATES MAINTAIN THE FLEXIBILITY IS BY CONTINUING ALTERNATE SERVICES AND MARKET RATES WE DON'T WANT TO INCENTIVIZE QUINCY PRACTICES BY CUTTING BACK. TOO SOON ON THE FLEXIBILITIES. ABOUT AN OUTCOME BASED. STRUCTURE THAT INTO NEEDS TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SUPPORTS FOR RESIDENTIAL AND ONE ONES. IN TERMS OF THE FUTURE BACK BETTER WE HAVE A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD A STRONGER SYSTEM CENTERED ON PERSONAL CHOICE. PANDEMIC DDS SYSTEM THEY SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES IT HAS A ONE POINT ONE BILLION DOLLAR FUNDING DEFICIT AS A GENOCIDE BINARY STUDY INSTRUCTURE PRIMARILY ON NORMALIZATION BASED FEE FOR SERVICE FINAL AND IT'S RIGID STRUCTURE LIMITS CHOICE AND CREATIVITY. CMS'S PORTION FOR VALUE BASED PAYMENT STRUCTURE AND IS JUNE NINTH MENTIONED WE NEED TO BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH EACH CBS SETTINGS WILL JUST OVER TWO YEARS. OUR CHALLENGE IS TO TAKE WHAT WE LEARNED. YEAH ALIGNED WITH THE DIRECTION FROM C. N. AT CMS. I DON'T REMEMBER WHERE AN ACT- SYSTEM REALIZING WE ARE GOING BACK TO FEBRUARY TWENTY TWENTY YOUR SOME STEPS. MENTAL TURNER SERVICES BONNET TO REDRESS DISPARITIES INSERTED INDIVIDUALS TO RECEIVE. SERVICES WHEN AND HOW THEY WANT. DON'T REALLY CARE. BASED ON INTO THE OUT CHOI. OUR COUNTRY ARE EUROS COUNTY SATISFY WAS TO REAL. LIKE THIS. IS ON HOW A TRUE CENTERED PLAN. IN THE UC TECHNO. NOT JUST FOR REMOTE SERVICE FOR PROVIDING OF. BOB HOW WE WORK INTERACT CONTINUE MONTHLY RATES POTENTIALLY EXPANDED OR SERVICES WOULD REQUIRE OUR STATE COME TRUE VALUE BASED. SURE THE MARKET RATES ARE EQUITY CONSISTENT ADEQUATE COST STATE ONE FOR READS STUDY- O. THIS IS A WIN WIN WIN KERN. INDIVIDUALS SUPPORTED FAMILIES DDS REGIONAL CENTERS AND PROVIDERS HAVE A COMMON GOAL BETTER OUTCOMES FOR INDIVIDUALS TO LEAD THE WINDS EIGHT UNIONS AFTER ALL THIS IS WHY WERE ALL INVOLVED IN THIS WORK. SO SUMMARIZING THANK YOU FOR STAYING IN THE SYSTEM MAINTAIN STABILITY THROUGH THE TRANSITION FROM THE PANDEMICS OF THE POST CODE ENVIRONMENT AND BUILD BACK BETTER THANKS FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF PEOPLE WITH INDIVIDUALS WITH INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. THANK YOU SIR NEXT WE HAVE JORDAN LINDSAY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR. OF THE ARK OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU DR RAM RELIANT COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND STAFF. I AM JORDAN LINDSAY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE ARC IN UNITED'S PEOPLE POLICY CALIFORNIA COLLABORATION. VERY QUICKLY BEFORE I ADDRESS THE QUESTIONS IN THE AGENDA I WANTED VERY QUICKLY COMMAND EXPRESSED TREMENDOUS GRATITUDE FOR THE VARIOUS COMPONENTS OF OUR AND DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES SYSTEM WELL COLLABORATED AND COMMUNICATED THROUGHOUT THIS PANDEMIC. TO KEEP PEOPLE SAFE AND HEALTHY I HAVE NEVER BEFORE SEEN THIS LEVEL OF PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN FAMILIES REGIONAL CENTERS PROVIDERS THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE LEGISLATURE ALL IN AN EFFORT TO SAVE LIVES AND IT HAS. UNDOUBTEDLY DONE EXACTLY THAT. I ALSO WANT TO QUICKLY EXPRESSED GRATITUDE TO YOU MISTER CHAIR AND THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE AND YOUR COLLEAGUES IN THE LEGISLATURE WHO. DURING THE LAST BUDGET CYCLE DEMONSTRATED GREAT LEADERSHIP BY PROTECTING OUR STATE'S MOST VULNERABLE FROM CUTS IN SERVICES AND SUPPORTS. EXACTLY THE TIME THEY NEEDED SUPPORT THE MOST SO THANK YOU AGAIN. TO ADDRESS MY QUESTIONS TODAY I'LL DIVIDE MY REMARKS INTO THREE CATEGORIES PANDEMIC RESPONSE EQUITY AND SUSTAINABILITY. FIRST PROPOSALS SPECIFIC TO PANDEMIC RESPONSE WHICH INCLUDE THE MINIMUM WAGE PROPOSAL BY ASSEMBLYMAN HOLDEN. AND THE REGIONAL CENTER SERVICE COORDINATOR PROPOSAL BY ASSEMBLYMAN FRAZIER. AS HAS BEEN DISCUSSED WIVES HAVE BEEN TURNED UPSIDE DOWN AND THE IMPACTS TO PEOPLE WITH INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES AND THEIR FAMILIES. HAS BEEN EXPONENTIAL AT EVERY SINGLE PART OF A PERSON SUPPORT SYSTEMS BEEN IMPACTED. MY BOARD OF DIRECTORS WHICH IS MADE UP ENTIRELY OF PEOPLE WITH ID AND FAMILY MEMBERS AND WHO ARE. FAIRLY WELL NO HAVE OFTEN BEEN AT A LOSS OF HOW TO GET BEST SUPPORT. OR SUPPORT THEIR LOVED ONES. IN THE IMPACTS ESPECIALLY THE IMPACTS TO THE MENTAL HEALTH OF CONSUMERS AND ALSO TO FAMILY. WELL BEING HAS BEEN DRASTIC. THE IMPACTS WOULD BE MUCH WORSE HOWEVER IF IT WEREN'T FOR THE HERO WITH THEM THAT HAS BEEN DISPLAYED UP AND DOWN THE STATE. BY OUR DIRECT SUPPORT PROFESSIONALS THEY HAVE SACRIFICED THEIR OWN HEALTH THEIR OWN WELL BEING THE WELL BEING OF THEIR FAMILIES TO ENSURE. AS MUCH CONTINUITY IN SAFETY AS POSSIBLE FOR THE INDIVIDUALS THEY SIR. THIS IS A WORK FORCE THAT IS PREDOMINANTLY WOMEN AND WOMEN OF COLOR. AND THEY HAVE BEEN AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE ESSENTIAL IN OUR RESPONSE TO THIS PANDEMIC. AND THEY HAVE MADE THE SACRIFICES WHILE EARNING NEAR OR AT MINIMUM WAGE DUE TO LOW RATES. AND AS WE KNOW MINIMUM WAGE CALIFORNIA IS ABOUT TO GO UP AGAIN BUT IN OUR SYSTEM THIS INCREASES APPLIED IN IN AN EQUITABLE. AND ACTUALLY PERVERSE METHOD BECAUSE SOME ORGANIZATIONS WILL RECEIVE AN INCREASE IN PAYMENTS TO OFFSET THE INCREASE THE MINIMUM WAGE IN SOMEWHAT. THAT MEANS SOME OF THESE ESSENTIAL HEROES WILL RECEIVE WAGE INCREASES AND SOME WALKED. AND THIS WAS HIGHLIGHTED BY MR KNIGHT'S COMMENTS WHICH HIGHLIGHTED THE IMMENSE UNDER UTILIZATION OF THE BUDGETED FUNDS FOR MINIMUM WAGE INCREASES. THERE IS A PROPOSAL FROM ASSEMBLYMAN HOLDEN TO FINALLY MAKE THIS METHOD EQUITABLE. INTO INCENTIVIZE ORGANIZATIONS TO PAY HIGHER WAGE INSTEAD OF WHAT WE CURRENTLY DO TO INCENTIVIZE ORGANIZATIONS TO KEEP STAFF AT MINIMUM WAGE. THIS WOULD BE DONE BY STANDARD THE STANDARD PERCENTAGE INCREASE TO LOW WAGE EARNERS REGARDLESS IF YOU MAKE MINIMUM WAGE OR MORE THAN MINIMUM WAGE. IT MAKES SENSE AND IT PROVIDES EQUITY NOW IS THE TIME FOR THE STATE TO REPLACE THE OUTDATED AND INEQUITABLE COMPENSATION METHODOLOGY WITH THE UNIFORMITY JUST MEANT. THAT WOULD ALLOW PROVIDERS TO PAY COMPETITIVE WAGES REFLECTIVE OF THE SKILLS AND DEDICATION DEDICATION. DEMANDED FOR QUALITY DIRECT SUPPORT. ALSO AS RELATES TO OUR PANDEMIC RESPONSE WE MUST STRENGTHEN INDIVIDUAL AND FAMILY ACCESS TO CRITICAL SERVICES AND SUPPORTS. AS I MENTIONED FAMILIES AND INDIVIDUALS ARE SEARCHING FOR METHODS OF SUPPORTS AND ADDS NEW OPTIONS BECOME AVAILABLE SUCH AS ALTERNATIVE SERVICES FAMILIES RELY MORE AND MORE ON THEIR SERVICE COORDINATORS AT THE REGIONAL CENTERS. OUR SERVICE COORDINATORS HOWEVER HAVE BEEN BURDENED WITH UNMANAGEABLE CASELOAD RATIOS NEARLY NINETY OR HUNDRED CLIENTS. BUT THE COMMITTEE YOUR COMMITTEE HAS A PROPOSAL FROM A SETTLEMENT FRAZIER TO REDUCE THESE CASELOAD RATIOS. SO THAT ALL FAMILIES AND INDIVIDUALS CAN HAVE TIMELY ACCESS TO SERVICE COORDINATION EXACTLY THIS TIME WHEN THEY NEED IT MOST. THE LEGISLATURE ANY MINISTRATION SHOULD ENSURE ACCESS TO SERVICE COORDINATION OF REGIONAL CENTERS ESPECIALLY AS SERVICES AND SUPPORTS ARE RAPIDLY CHANGING AS MR ZIGMAN- MENTIONED. AND THEY NEED TO DO SO BY ENHANCING FUNDING FIRST SERVICE COORDINATORS AT REGIONALS REGIONAL CENTERS CAN COMPLY. WITH CURRENT FEDERAL GUIDANCE ON TOP KESSLER RATIOS. NEXT I WANT TO DISCUSS OPPORTUNITIES TO MAKE OUR SYSTEM MORE EQUITABLE TO DOOR TO DIVERSE COMMUNITIES WE APPLAUD THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO INCLUDE FIVE POINT THREE MILLION TO IMPLEMENT A NEW COMMUNITY NAVIGATOR MARC MODEL IN PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR FORTY SEVEN FAMILY RESOURCE CENTERS. IN OUR CURRENT CRISIS THIS WILL HELP SPECIFICALLY IN TWO WAYS ONE PROVIDES CRITICAL INFORMATION BY A TRUSTED SOURCE TO INCREASE UTILIZATION OF SERVICES BY DIVERSE COMMUNITIES IN CHIU IT'LL ALSO HELP MITIGATE. THE SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN EARLY START UTILIZATION THAT DIRECTOR PARCHMENT SHE'S EARLY START THE ONLY RESOURCE CENTERS ALREADY HAVE A CONTRACT TO PROVIDE INFORMATION REFERRALS BUT THEY'VE BEEN CHRONICALLY UNDERFUNDED. AND WHILE THE COVER ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES. THEY HAVE DONE SO WITH MINIMAL STAFF SOMETHING LIKE ONE OR TWO STAFF SOMETIMES TO ADEQUATELY MEET THE NEED ON IT AND THE NEED IS. ESPECIALLY NOW THERE IS THE NEED. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL UNDOUBTEDLY HELP EACH FAMILY RESOURCE CENTER TO INCREASE OUR OUTREACH AND THIS COMBINED WITH THE EQUITY GRANTS THAT IS AVAILABLE TO ANY AND ALL ORGANIZATIONS OUR SYSTEM THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR'S DEMONSTRATING A CLEAR COMMITMENT. EQUITY FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS WITH. INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. IN IF YOU CAN ACROSS AN EXTRA MONEY EVEN IF YOU MILLION THIS WOULD ARGUABLY BE THE BEST BANG FOR YOUR BUCK TO INCREASE. OUR BEYOND THE FIVE POINT THREE MILLION DOLLAR PROPOSAL. AND THEN FINALLY I QUICKLY WANT TO DISCUSS THAT SUSTAINABILITY IN THE PANDEMIC IN BEYOND YOUR FORTY HER GREAT COMMENTS FROM IS RULE AND OTHERS- FIRST WE ARE GRATEFUL THAT THE ADMINISTRATION THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED RETAINER PAYMENTS. AND THE TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE MILLION FOR INCREASED UTILIZATION FOR AN IN PERSON SERVICES. IT STABILIZE SERVICE DELIVERY SO THAT WE COLLECT COLLECTIVELY. COULDN'T MOVE OUR FOCUS AWAY FROM RETAINING OUR WORKFORCE AND INSTEAD. FOCUS ON MOBILIZING A RESPONSE AND WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR THAT. I ALSO WANT TO MENTION THAT THIS. RESPONSE THAT WE'VE ALL QUICKLY BEEN TALKING ABOUT HAS HAPPENED. BY A SYSTEM THAT IS ONE POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS UNDER FIVE. I WANT TO SAY MANAGING THE RESPONSE WE COULD HAVE RIGHT NOW WE HADN'T BEEN HOLDING ON BY A THREAD FOR THE LAST TWO DECADES. IMAGINE THE RESPONSE WHAT COULD BE HAPPENING. ABOVE AND BEYOND WHAT WE'RE DOING. THE LEGISLATURE AND THE COMMUNITY FOUGHT HARD TO REDUCE THIS UNDER FUNDING FROM ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION TO ONE POINT FOUR BILLION. AND WE'RE PREPARED TO MAKE MORE WE WERE PREPARED TO MAKE MORE PROGRESS THIS YEAR TO IMPLEMENT THE RATE STUDY. BUT I IMPLORE THE COMEDIAN ADMINISTRATION CONSIDER THIS PANDEMIC IS ONLY A POLICY IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RATE STUDY. MR SIEGMAN USE THAT THE PHRASE NORTHSTAR AND I WANT TO STEAL THAT AND STAY OFF AS WE DID CLOSE INSTITUTIONS WHAT IS THAT NORTH STAR NOW AND THE RATE STUDY IS A PART OF THAT NORTH STAR AND WE CAN'T FORGET THAT AND PUT IT ON THE SHELF. OTHERWISE THIS WOULD BE YET ANOTHER STUDY THAT CONFIRMS YES CALIFORNIA'S UNDERFUNDING INDIVIDUALS WITH I. D. D. THEIR FAMILIES AND OUR SUPPORT STAFF. WE ARE GOING TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT. EVEN WORSE. IS THE PROPOSAL IN JANUARY BUDGET THAT SAYS YES WE CONFIRM YOU WERE HUGELY UNDERFUNDED BUT NEXT YEAR WE'RE GOING TO TAKE MONEY AWAY FROM YOU. BY KNOCKING THE SUSPENSION OF ANY PROGRESS YOU MADE IN THE LAST COUPLE YEARS. ALL THE COMMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE BY THE L. A. O. YOU MISTER CHAIR AT THE BEGINNING THE HEARING COMMENTS FROM OTHER LEGISLATURES ARE LEGISLATORS OVER THE LAST FEW WEEKS PUSHING BACK. ON THIS STATUTE IN EMPHASIZING THAT AT THE LANE AND CUT IN SERVICES IS IN GOOD GOOD ENOUGH. IT ONLY SERVES TO CREATE MORE UNCERTAINTY IN MORNINGSIDE. IN A TIME WHEN CALIFORNIANS WITH DISABILITIES THEIR FAMILIES. AND THEIR SUPPORT STAFF NEEDS STABILITY. THAT CONCLUDES MY COMMENTS THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR NEXT WE HAVE JACKIE DILLARD FOSTER EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF STEP AND BOARD MEMBER OF CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY LIVING NETWORK. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN I APPRECIATE THE TIME TODAY MY NAME IS JACKIE FOSTER IN THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF STRATEGIES TO EMPOWER PEOPLE WE PROVIDES SUPPORTED LIVING INDEPENDENT LIVING EMPLOYMENT DAY SERVICES I ALSO SIT ON THE BOARD OF THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY LIVING NETWORK. THAT REPRESENTS SUPPORTED LIVING INDEPENDENT LIVING EMPLOYMENT PERSONAL ASSISTANCE AND RESPITE CARE THESE ARE ALL IN PERSON SERVICES SO I'M GOING TO REALLY FOCUS MY- MY COMMENTS ON THE DIRECT SUPPORT PROFESSIONALS AND- THREE FOCUS AREAS THE TRIUMPHS AND THE CHALLENGES FIRST WITH THE PANDEMIC BEGAN. CALIFORNIA SUPPORT PROGRAMS ARE ALREADY UNDERSTAFFED IN PERSON SUPPORT WORK IS COMPLICATED WORK THAT REQUIRES DEDICATED TRAINED PERSONNEL THEIR WORK IS UNDERVALUED AND HAS ALWAYS BEEN UNDERPAID BY THE STATE MAKING IT DIFFICULT ALREADY TO ATTRACT RECRUIT AND RETAIN. ADEQUATE STAFFING THE PACKED THE PANDEMIC ONLY MAGNIFIED THIS PROBLEM WHEN THE SHELTER IN PLACE ORDER OCCURRED TRADITIONAL DAY PROGRAM AND DAY SERVICES WERE FORCED TO CLOSE AND MANY MOVE TO SOME FORMER REMOTE OR VIRTUAL SERVICES. THAT MEANT THOSE RESURGENT RECEIVING SERVICES ARE SPENDING ALMOST ALL OF THEIR TIME IN ISOLATION AND THE NEED FOR IN PERSON DIRECT SUPPORT PROFESSIONALS INCREASE AS THEY NOW NEEDED TO COVER THOSE DAY PROGRAM HOURS AS WELL BUT THE AVAILABLE WORKFORCE WAS DECREASING. MOST OF OUR STAFF ARE WOMEN THEIR SINGLE MOTHERS ETHNICALLY DIVERSE AND LIKE WITH WORKING WOMEN ACROSS THE COUNTRY THEY SUDDENLY HAD THE ADDITIONAL RESPONSIBILITY OF HOME SCHOOLING THEIR CHILDREN AND CARING FOR THEIR OWN PARENTS AND LOVED ONES. THERE WERE MEN WHO ALSO HAD TO MAKE THE SACRIFICES MANY OUR OF OUR STAFF HAVE HAD TO LEAVE THE WORK FORCE TO TAKE ON THESE ADDITIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES OF HOME SCHOOLING AND CHILDCARE AND THIS HAS EXASPERATED THE ALREADY EXISTING STAFFIG CRISIS. ANOTHER LAYER OF UNCERTAINTY FOR STAFFING WAS DIRECTLY RELATED TO CODE NINETEEN WHEN THE STAFF WAS EXPOSED OR TESTED POSITIVE THEY WOULD ENTER FOURTEEN DAY QUARANTINE WHEN YOU ARE ALREADY UNDERSTAFFED THIS WAS NOT ONLY A DENTED ADDED STRESSOR TO THE PROVIDER BUT THE PERSON SUPPORTED BECAUSE. WERE THEY EXPOSED AT ALL SO THEY HAD INSTEAD. IN STAFF. ADDITIONALLY THE WAS THE UNSUNG MAN. FOR PROVIDERS OF THE EIGHTY HOUR COLD SICK TIME PAY ENACTED BY CALIFORNIA. A SERVICE FOR GROWTH REVIVES THE BIGGEST QUESTIONS WE HAD WORKED WATER ESSENTIAL WORKFORCE CONTINUE TO SHOW UP. DURING TO WORK DURING THIS DEADLY PANDEMIC WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THEY DIDN'T SHOW UP. ONE OF THOSE RECEIVING SERVICES WERE LEFT HOME ALONE HOW WOULD WE PROVIDE THE NECESSARY NECESSARY TRAINING FOR THEM TO BECOME INFECTION CONTROL EXPERT. COULD WE SECURE THE P. P. COULD BE SECURE SANITATION SUPPLIES. BUT JUST LIKE EMERGENCY ROOM DOCTORS NURSES FIREFIGHTERS AND POLICE OFFICERS OUR STAFF DID SHOW UP BECAUSE THEY KNEW THEY COULD BE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH FOR THEIR CLIENTS NOT ONLY DID THEY SHOW UP. THEY BECAME THE BACKBONE OF THE RESPONSE TO THIS PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS MANY HAVEWORK EXCESSIVE OVERTIME HOURS DUE TO THE STAFFING SHORTAGE. THE DIRECT SUPPORT PROFESSIONALS HAVE BEEN THE HIDDEN WORKFORCE THEY DID NOT GET THE RECOGNITION OF THE HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS OR EVEN GROCERY STORE CLERKS BUT WHAT THEY DID AND WHAT THEY CONTINUE TO DO HAS BEEN INVALUABLE. I THINK IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT AS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS PANDEMIC THAT WE TALK ABOUT THE DIRECT SUPPORT PROFESSIONALS. I WANTED TO INTRODUCE YOU TO LUSTENAU LAWSON L. AND IS A DIRECT SUPPORT PROFESSIONAL SINCE. TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN SHE WORKS WITH DAHLE. THIS JANUARY DOM WAS DIAGNOSED WITH COPD NINETEEN WHEN HE WAS TAKEN BY EMTS TO THE HOSPITAL THE HOSPITAL DID NOT WANT TO ADMIT DOM. BECAUSE OF HIS COMPLEX BEHAVIORS EVEN THOUGH AS BLOOD OFF LEVEL WAS AT 86% HE WAS SENT HOME LUSTENAU MADE THE CHOICE AT THAT TIME. THAT SHE WAS GOING TO BE THE PRIMARY CARETAKER FOR DAHLE. SHE STAYED WITH HIM FOR EIGHTEEN DAYS SHE LEFT HER FIANCE HER ELDERLY IN LAWS WHO MOVED IN DURING THE PANDEMIC SHE LEFT THE CHILDREN AT HOME TO STAY WITH DON BECAUSE SHE KNEW IF SHE DID NOT STAY THERE. THAT DAHLE MAY NOT SURVIVE COBIT NINETEEN. THIS IS A PICTURE OF DOM I REALLY WANT TO SHOW THIS THIS DUMB AND LAZY BOY CHAIR THAT THE VIBRATING CHAIR. IS VIBRATING CHAIR WHO KNEW THAT A MASSAGE CHAIR WOULD-BE A REALLY CRITICAL COMPONENT TO COVER NINETEEN. BECAUSE HE COULD SET UP AND IT KEPT HIS LUNGS CLEAR SHE MADE SURE HE HAD THAT SHARE SHE MADE SURE HE WAS IN THE CHAIR. SHE ONLY SLEPT WHEN HE SLEPT. SHE WAS AWAKE ALL THAT TIME I REMEMBER SHE TEXTED ME AND SHE SAID YOU KNOW WHAT DON'T FEELING BETTER BECAUSE HE HIT ME TODAY SO WE KNOW THAT DON WAS FEELING BETTER THIS IS LOS ANALES COMMITMENT. BUT IT WASN'T JUST LAWSUIT NOW MAKING THIS COMMITMENT THESE WERE DIRECT SUPPORT PROFESSIONALS ACROSS CALIFORNIA. THESE DIRECT SUPPORT PROFESSIONALS BECAME ENTERTAINERS TEACHERS NURSES COUNSELORS COMMUNICATION FACILITATORS AND TECH SUPPORT IN THE CLIENT'S HOME. THEY HAVE KEPT PEOPLE OUT OF THE HOSPITAL BY KEEPING THEM SAFE AT HOME SUPPORTING THEM EFFECTIVELY WHEN THEY DID BECOME ILL SOMETIMES A GREAT SACRIFICE TO THEMSELVES. BUT ALL THEIR EFFORTS WE KNOW THAT PEOPLE WITH INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES THEIR LIVES WERE SAVED BECAUSE OF THE WORK OF THESE DIRECT SUPPORT PROFESSIONALS. WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE DDS- MADE AVAILABLE IN JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE WE WISH IT HAPPENED SOONER. BUT THE ISOLATION RIGHT BECAUSE LAW TO KNOW WAS ABLE TO GET A COMPETITIVE WAGE WHILE SHE WAS THERE WITH DON NOW OUR. ONLY HOPE IS THAT COMPETITIVE WAGE WOULD BECOME A MORE PER. WAY FOR SOMEONE LIKE LOS NOW. HAD A WEEK MAINTAIN QUALITY SERVICES AS A QUEST WILL BE IN. WELL WE PROFESSIONALS THE WORK FORCE THIS WORK FORCE WE CALL THEM DIRECT SUPPORT PROFESSIONALS BUT WE DON'T PAY THEM PROFESSIONAL WAGES. WE NEED TO PAY THESE DIRECT SUPPORT PROFESSIONALS A COMPETITIVE WAGE EVEN THOUGH OUR STAFF PROVIDE THE LICENSING CARE THE STATE'S WAGE RATE IS EMBARRASSINGLY LOW. OFTEN NEAR MINIMUM WAGE OR MINIMUM WAGE FOR MANY INSTANCES. SUPPORTING IN EDUCATING THE WORKFORCE AROUND VACCINES AND ITS SAFETY IS GOING TO BE ANOTHER CRITICAL COMPORTAMIENTO- COMPONENT AS WE MOVE FORWARD. NUMBER THREE WE MUST IMPLEMENT LONG TERM SOLUTIONS THAT EMPHASIZE EQUITY AND ACCESS AND ACHIEVE QUALITY OUTCOMES. ACCOUNTABILITY WE HAVE TO ALIGN OUR RESOURCES WITH MEASURABLE QUALITY OUTCOMES C. C. L. N. IS PROUD OF THE- INTRODUCTION OF AB EIGHT ONE THREE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER MALL AND IT'S A PILOT PROJECT TO MEASURE QUALITY OUTCOMES WE THINK HAT'S A CRITICAL COMPONENT. I AGREE WITH EVERYONE ELSE YOU CANNOT LEAVE THIS EIGHT POINT TWO SUNSETTING MANY PROVIDERS HAVE GIVEN THOSE BONUSES OR THEY'VE USE THAT TO RECRUIT STAFF COULD YOU IMAGINE. WE END UP HAVING TO CUT WAGES AFTER EVERYTHING'S THESE THESE DIRECT SUPPORT PROFESSIONALS HAVE DONE WE ALSO NEED A LOCAL MINIMUM WAGE FUNDED THIS HAS BEEN AN ONGOING. CONVERSATION WE APPRECIATE IS STILL HAPPENING. BUT I ALSO REALLY WANTED IN WITH THIS REALLY IMPORTANT POINT FOR ME AS A PROVIDER WHO. WHO DOES SUPPORTED LIVING SERVICES WE CANNOT MAKE ISOLATION A HABIT. OUR COMMUNITY HAS FOUGHT TO GET ISOLATION FOR THIRTY YEARS THE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS ARE CLOSED AS WE MOVE TOWARDS THIS NEW NORMAL WE MUST STAY COMMITTED TO SUPPORTING A PERSON'S CHOSEN WAY OF LIFE. AND HAVING FULL INCLUSION IN THE IN THE COMMUNITY SO I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THOSE ARE MY COMMENTS I TALK REALLY FAST BECAUSE. I WAS TOLD TO SELL. THANK YOU- WE HAVE JUDY PRESS. OF DISSENT VOICES UNITED. THANK YOU DOCTOR ON A LOT THANK YOU MANY MEMBERS I'M JUDY MARC I'M A PROUD MOM OF JOSHUA WHO'S TWENTY FOUR AND HAS AUTISM I'M ALSO THE PRESIDENT OF DISABILITY VOICES UNITED STATEWIDE ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION DIRECTED BY PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND THEIR FAMILIES. IT'S BEEN A LONG DAY BUT HOPEFULLY YOU'VE SAVED THE BEST FOR LAST I AM HONORED TO TESTIFIED TODAY BECAUSE IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU LISTEN FIRST AND HOPEFULLY NOT LAST TO THE PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND THEIR FAMILIES. AS THE PENALTY WAS GIVEN THE GAME AND ONE WHO CAN NEVER RETIRE FROM ADVOCATING FOR MY SON AND OTHERS I HOPE TO PROVIDE YOU WITH THE REALITIES WE FACE IN ACCESSING SERVICES. DURING THE PAST PANDEMIC. VOICES UNITED HAS LISTEN TO SELF ADVOCATES AND FAMILIES THROUGH TWENTY TWO WEBINARS IN A STATEWIDE SURVEY. HERE'S WHAT WE LEARNED AND SOME RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVING OUR SERVICES TO. NUMBER NE DIRECTIVES FROM DDS ARE NOT GETTING DIRECTLY TO FAMILIES. WE WERE GRATIFIED THE DDS ISSUED AN ARRAY OF DIRECTIVES GETTING INDIVIDUALS BY A VITALLY NEEDED FLEXIBILITY. FEW HOWEVER HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THEM BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T INFORMED OR WERE DENIED THE SERVICE. FOR EXAMPLE DDS DATA SHOW THAT VERY FEW FAMILIES HAVE ACTUALLY USED FOR DISSIDENT DIRECTED SERVICES IN THE PAST YEAR. NUMBER TWO COMMUNITIES OF COLOR CONTINUE TO FACE SIGNIFICANT DISPARITIES. ARE RECENT ANALYSIS OF POS DATA SHOWS THAT RACIAL AND ETHNIC DISPARITIES PERSIST DESPITE FIFTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO COMBAT THIS PROBLEM. LET'S YOU KNOW CONTINUE TO FACE THE GREATEST DISPARITIES GETTING ONLY 42% OF WHAT WHITES RECEIVED MAKE IT STATEWIDE LAST FISCAL YEAR. NOT A SINGLE REGIONAL CENTER IS MAKING SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS. AND MOST ARE MOVING BACKWARDS. AND WE FEARED DISPARITIES HAVE BEEN DISASTER BY THE CANTON. THERE NEEDS TO BE CLEAR EXPECTATIONS AND CONSEQUENCES FOR REGIONAL CENTERS WHO ARE NOT MAKING PROGRESS ON ELIMINATING DISPARITIES. NUMBER THREE THE SELF DETERMINATION PROGRAM IS BEING BLOCKED BY LAYERS OF UNNECESSARY BUREAUCRACY. THE SELF DETERMINATION PROGRAM WAS TAILOR MADE FOR A PACK THOSE IN THE PROGRAM HAD THE FLEXIBILITY TO DO UNIQUE THINGS TO MAKE THEM HAPPY HEALTHY AND SAFE. IMPLEMENTATION BARRIERS HAVE BEEN SO GREAT THAT FEWER THAN HAVE MOVED INTO THE PROGRAM. DDS MISTER PROVIDE MORE OVERSIGHT AND CLEAR DIRECTION I REGIONAL CENTERS NEED TO REDUCE BUREAUCRACY IN ORDER TO ELIMINATE BARRIERS TO PARTICIPATION ESPECIALLY IF THE PROGRAMS TO FULL IMPLEMENTATION IN LESS THAN FIVE MONTHS. THE SELF DETERMINATION PROGRAM WHICH THE LEGISLATURE CREATED EIGHT LONG YEARS AGO MUST BE ALLOWED. TO FULFILL ITS PROMISE. NUMBER FOUR THE NEEDS OF MANY PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES ARE NOT BEING BACKED INTO THE ONTO ALTERNATIVE SERVICES MODEL. WELL DDS QUICKLY DEVELOPED THE SYSTEM IN ORDER TO SUSTAIN THE PROVIDER NETWORK WE HAVE NOT YET SEEN DATA ON CONSUMER SATISFACTION WITH ALTERNATIVE SERVICE. BEFORE THE SYSTEM WAS LAUNCHED HEADWALL PROVIDERS WERE STILL BEING FULLY PAID GIVING YOU AND OTHERS CONDUCTED SURVEYS. AND FOUND THAT ONLY HALF OF THE INDIVIDUALS AND CLOSED PROGRAMS WILL CONTINUE TO RESTART RECEIVE SERVICE. DO YOU HAVE REGIONAL CENTERS WE TO ENSURE THAT SERVICE PROVIDERS ARE ACTUALLY MEETING THE NEEDS OF CLIENTS. FOR MANY A THIRTY MINUTE ZERO CLASS EVERY DAY IS NOT ENOUGH. WE HAVE SEEN THAT THERE IS A SAFE WAY TO PROVIDE IN PERSON INDIVIDUAL I SERVICES AND CONSUMERS SHOULD BE ABLE TO ACCESS THAT NOW. THE IRONY IS THAT AS AWFUL AS THE LAST YEAR IS BANNED WE HAVE PRESENT WE'VE BEEN PRESENTED WITH OPPORTUNITIES TO FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE OUR SYSTEM. TO BE MORE PERSON CENTERED AND OUTCOME DRIVEN. THIS IS THE TIME TO MOVE AWAY FROM PROVIDING SERVICES IN CONGREGATE SETTINGS NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF THE DANGERS OF PENTAX. BUT BECAUSE OF THE IMPENDING AGE CBS RULE. THE SETTINGS MUST BE PERSON CENTERED AND COMMUNITY BASED TO RECEIVE FEDERAL MATCHING FUNDS IN TWO SHORT YEARS. IT JUST MAKES SENSE TO FOCUS ON HELPING PROVIDERS MAKE THE CHANGES NECESSARY TO COMPLY WITH THE RULE BEFORE THE- INSTEAD OF LETTING THEM RETURN TO PRE PANDEMIC OUTDATED SERVICE. ULTIMATELY WE NEED A SYSTEM WHERE PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES COME FIRST IN THE PAST YEAR PROVIDERS GOT PAID IN ORDER TO SUSTAIN THE SERVICES STAFF REGIONAL CENTERS MAINTAIN THEIR OPERATIONS BUT MANY FAMILIES HAD TO BEG FOR MORE HOURS A RESPITE OR DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THEY CAN ASK FOR HELP DURING A CRISIS. I HOPE MY TESTIMONY MAKES CLEAR THAT OUR SYSTEM IS UPSIDE DOWN. WHAT WE SHOULD BE CONCERNED ABOUT SERVICE PROVIDERS IN REGIONAL CENTRES WE MUST FOCUS ON IMPROVING OUR- ELIMINATING RACIAL THIS RACIAL DISPARITIES AND MEETING THE PANDEMIC NEEDS A FAMILIES TO SELF DETERMINE ANY SELF DETERMINATION AND FLEXIBILITY. THE SYSTEM IS OURS. BUT SOMETIMES IT DOESN'T FEEL THAT WAY PARTICULARLY IN THE FAST PAST YEAR. MY ORGANIZATIONS FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND HE ASKED TO MEET THESE CHALLENGES TO MEANINGFULLY IMPROVE OUR SYSTEM THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND LET'S BRING IT BACK TO THE DíAS AND SEE IF MEMBERS HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRAZIER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I'M- LIKE TO GO TO A DRUG DEPARTMENT. WITH A QUESTION HOME. THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF- ANGST IN THE PROVIDER COMMUNITY WHEN THEY LOOK AT- THE POSSIBILITY INAPE THEY FEEL THAT THERE'S A DIRECT OF COMING OR SOME KIND OF- ISSUE COMING WITH THE- AVOIDERS A GOT THE PPP. AND THAT THERE WAS GOING TO BE A PENALTY FOR RECEIVING THAT THAT YOU WOULD BE REDUCING PAYMENTS TO THOSE PROVIDERS- BECAUSE- THEY THEY HAD THIS HELP. YOU KNOW THIS WAS TO HELP% INCENTIVIZE AND KEEP EMPLOYEES PAY LEASES AND- RANTON ALL OF THESE THINGS I'M- THROUGH THIS ALREADY UNDERFUNDED. SYSTEM I'M HOPING THE DDS RECOGNIZES THAT THERE WAS INTENDED TO KEEP PEOPLE SOLVING KEEP PEOPLE EMPLOYED IN AND NOT PENALIZE THESE PROVIDERS FOR. GETTING THIS THIS HELP I'M ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT THE FOUGHT THROUGH THE ADMINISTRATION OR OR- FINANCE THAT THE POSSIBILITY OF BEING TAXED ON THIS THROUGH THE STATE I KNOW THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ISN'T TAXING BUT IF. IF THE STATE IS CONSIDERING TAXING THE P. P. P. THEN WE REALLY DIMINISH THE ABILITY TO HELP PEOPLE WHEN WE START CONTINUALLY TAKING THIS. APPROACH SO THAT WAS MY FIRST QUESTION TO DIRECTOR BARGING. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRAZIER- THE ISSUE- YOU COULD USE OF SAID PAYMENT PROTECTION PROGRAM THE FUNDING- AS IT RELATES TO THE TIME PERIOD IN WHICH- RETAINER PAYMENTS WERE PROVIDED TO SERVICE PROVIDERS- HAS COME TO QUESTION AND AS FAR AS HOW DO YOU I'M PROVIDERS BUT ALSO THE STATE AND THEN THIS IS GOING TO QUESTION THAT HAS BEEN RAISED EVEN ON FEDERALLY- YOU MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S NOT A DUPLICATION OF PAYMENT FOR SAME TYPE. OF EXPENDITURES- SO ABSOLUTELY APPRECIATE THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE FURTHER CLARITY- WE ARE WORKING ON CLARIFYING ARE- FAQS TO THIS ISSUE BECAUSE IT IT DOES APPEAR TO BE- THAT THERE ARE SOME QUESTIONS FROM OUR COMMUNITY THAT WE CAN ASSIST WHAT- BY PROVIDING THAT CLARITY- WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE AREAS IN WHICH- PROVIDERS HAVE ACCESS TO THOSE RESOURCES THAT WERE. MADE AVAILABLE FROM THE STATE AS WELL AS A FEDERALLY FUNDED THOSE RESOURCES ARE AVAILABLE- AND IF THERE'S ANY KIND OF CLARITY ON THE PROTECTIONS THAT NEED TO BE MADE- WELL WE'RE WORKING TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THAT THAT CLARITY TO IT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE. LESS CONFUSION. ARE NO CONFUSION IF WE CAN GET THERE. I APPRECIATE THAT- MY NEXT QUESTION IS TO THE OF FINE. I'M ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU BROUGHT UP WAS THE- THE MINIMUM WAGE A COMPONENT. AND I THINK WE'RE IN THE FIRST PANEL LISA CLIMB UP HAD MENTIONED THE HIGHER COST OF LIVING IN OTHER REGIONS AND THERE ARE THE HIGHER. THE HIGHER MINIMUM WAGE ADJUSTMENTS THAT ARE MADE AND SOME PEOPLE GET PAID MORE AND SOME PEOPLE GET PAID LESS- NO THIS IS A LEGISLATURE YOU WAS THE AND YOU KNOW VERY RESOUNDING SUPPORT FOR INCREASING THE MINIMUM WAGE STATEWIDE. IN THREE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF GOING FORWARD ABOUT TWO AND TO NOT ACKNOWLEDGE THE COST OF LIVING IN CERTAIN AREAS. AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ACTUALLY GOOD KNOWLEDGE IN THAT AND TRYING TO HELP THE WORK FORCE. WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO RECOGNIZE THAT AND MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S TECHNOLOGY UNFUNDED IN THIS PROGRAM IN THIS IN THIS BUDGET CYCLE I MEAN. SERIOUSLY WE HAVE A HARD ENOUGH TIME KEEPING ON A WORK FORCE GOING BECAUSE AS IT WAS MENTIONED BY ONE OF THE ADVOCATES. IS PRIMARILY A HELLO IN THE PROVIDERS WORKFORCE THE WORKFORCE THEMSELVES. A MINIMUM WAGE JOB AND DURING THIS PANDEMIC IN THE CHARISMATIC AND ALL THE THINGS WITH HIM GOING TO PLUMMET IT'S ACTUALLY BEEN MORE BENEFICIAL FOR THE WORK FORCE TO GO GET UNEMPLOYMENT THAT ACTUALLY WORK FOR THE- THE FOLKS. ARE GOING FOR BECAUSE THEY MAKE MORE MONEY. UNEMPLOYMENT AND SO- BUT WOULD HOPE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION THROUGH THE FINANCE AND BUDGET WITH OUR COMMITTEE ACKNOWLEDGED THE MINIMUM WAGE HAS TO BE ACKNOWLEDGED IN THE JURISDICTIONS THAT THAT ACTUALLY IT IS HIGHER. CAN YOU OF KIND OF. ELABORATE ON THE SENSE OF WHY EXIST ACROSS THE BOARD. I THANK YOU SOME NUMBER- STEVEN PUBLIC DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO NO WE WELCOME THESE DISCUSSIONS AT AND SAY THAT YOU KNOW GROWING THE MAGICIAN HAS NOT WANTED- YOU KNOW WAGE INCREASES THAT HAVE BEEN DRIVEN BY A LOCAL- MINIMUM WAGE DECISIONS WELL THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET DOES- PROPOSES AND STATED. HUNDRED NINETY FIVE MILLION TOTAL FIND- BUT THAT IS THE ONLY ADJUSTMENT- THERE'S BEEN PROVIDED FOR SB THREE MINIMUM. WAGE THE GOVERNMENT WHAT IT. OKAY BUT AND I JUST WANNA. THAT MY STAFF KIND OF DID A HISTORIC BUDGET ANALYSIS FOR THE LAST THIRTY YEARS. AND IN NINETEEN NINETY BETWEEN NINETEEN NINETY AND NOW PRESENT TIME TWENTY TWENTY. WE'RE ACTUALLY PAYING THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS LESS PER CONSUMER THAT WE WERE IN NINETEEN NINETY WHEN COMPARED OF DOLLARS. AND SO YOU KNOW WHEN YOU LOOK AT OTHER COMPONENTS OF THE BUDGET WERE. THE CALIFORNIA PRISON SYSTEM MORE SPENDING SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS OR MORE PER PRISONER BUT WE'RE ONLY PAYING WORK AT THIS POINT IN THAT. THIS IS WHAT MY STAFF IS PROVIDED TO ME IN TWENTY TWENTY DOLLARS WE'RE SPENDING ABOUT TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS PER CONSUMER. AND SO WE NEED TO LOOK AT AND AS OTHERS HAVE MENTIONED. UNDERSTANDING OF THE RATE STUDY CAME OUT A KNOWLEDGE UNDER FUNDING OF SERVICES AND MONEY. AND GOING FORWARD WITH THE AND KNOWLEDGE MEANT THAT THE WE HAVE LIVED OFF THE BACKS OF THIS POPULATION ON EVERY RECESSION EVERY CUT BACK EVERYTHING THAT WE'VE DONE. AND I'M YU KNOW A SHAME THAT WE HAVE DONE THAT. BUT WE NEED TO STEP UP AND IGNORES IT. IT COSTS MORE IN TODAY'S DOLLARS TO PROVIDE. THE ADDITIONAL SERVICES ARE REQUIRED THE CENSUS HAS GROWN DRAMATICALLY AS IT SAYS IN THIS BUDGET I THINK IT'S FIFTEEN THOUSAND MORE PEOPLE IN IN THE SYSTEM. BUT YET WE TALK ABOUT. NOT SUSTAINING. PROGRAMS IN ALL OF THESE THINGS AND WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO MAKE SURE SO I'M I'M HOPING THAT WE CAN FIND. A COMMON GROUND THAT THE ASSESS THE TASTE AND I'M GOING TO BE INTRODUCING AN ACA THAT REQUIRES THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN THE SAME KIND OF SIMILARITY IS PROP NINETY EIGHT FOR EDUCATION. IS THAT WE HAVE TO FUND AS A BASIC LEVEL OF FUNDING HOPEFULLY INCLUDING THE RATE STUDY- THAT'S COME TO CONCLUSION THROUGH COMMITTEE AND ALL OF THAT. AND AND FINANCE BUT WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO PROTECT THIS COMMUNITY. AND BY DOING SO WITH THIS AC I'M HOPING THAT WE CAN FIND THAT COMMON GROUND. AND STEP FORWARD AS THE OTHER ADVOCATES OF SAID. YOU KNOW THERE'S SOME VERY SHINING MOMENTS IN THIS IN THIS WORLD PEOPLE HAVE BEEN HELPED BUT THERE ALSO IS THE DISPARITY COMPONENT. HAVEN'T WE NEED TO FIND A COMMON GROUND AND GET THAT MONEY OUT THERE TO THE PEOPLE. AN INCREASE. THE MONEY FOR THE WORK FORCE BECAUSE THE WORKFORCE IS SORELY SORELY UNDERPAID FOR WHAT THEY HAVE TO DO. THAT WAS DIRECTOR OF FINANCE. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE DO YOU WISH TO COMMENT. I SEE MOBILE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- YEAH ONCE AGAIN I AND WE'LL LOOK FORWARD TO ONGOING DISCUSSIONS THROUGHOUT THE BUDGET PROCESS. THANK YOU. CANCEL ONE OF THE THINGS I'D LIKE TO GO BACK TO OUR REGIONAL CENTER- ERICA'S EGGMAN IF YOU WOULD COME UP ABOARD AND SO I COULD ASK MORE QUESTIONS. WHAT WHEN WE HAVE THE- DIRECT SERVICE PROFESSIONALS AND THE ADULT GROUP HOMES. I'M HEARING THAT THERE IS. ACTUALLY THERE. ONE OF THE PROVIDERS THAT HAVE BEEN HARDEST HIT. AND WHO ARE GOING OUT OF BUSINESS HOW ARE WE ADAPTING TO THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL PLACEMENTS. IN YOUR AREA OR YOU KNOW WE DON'T WITH THE DEMISE OF THE THEY WERE THE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS AND NO BACKUPS WHAT ARE WE DOING WHEN SOMEBODY HAS NO ABILITY WHERE THEY CAN'T GET EMPLOYEES TO DO IT ANYMORE WHAT WHAT'S THE BACKUP WHAT'S THE PLAN B. FOR THESE FOR THESE- ADULTERANTS QUOTED PERIOD. BOB MERRICK SICKENING GOLDEN GATE REGIONAL CENTER THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRAZIER FOR THE QUESTION- IT'S COMPLICATED OF COURSE WE HAVEN'T SEEN ANY KIND OF MASS- CLOSURES OF HOMES FOR SURE WE WOULD HAVE AS I SAID PREVIOUSLY TO STAND THEM THROUGH. HEALTH AND SAFETY FUNDING FROM THE DEPARTMENT WHICH IS JUST INCREDIBLE- IT IS A MATTER OF DEVELOPING OTHER MODELS- IN ADDITION TO A LICENSED GROUP HOMES HOMEOWNERS SUPPORTED LIVING AS JACKIE TALKED ABOUT AND- FAMILY OKAY AGENCY AN IOS SERVICES. SPECIALIZED RESIDENTIAL SERVICES ARE NUMBER OF DIFFERENT MODELS THAT ARE CONSTANTLY BEING- DEVELOPED AN EVEN TEN MINUTES THE PANDEMIC WE'VE STILL HAD SOME OUT REACH. OF PEOPLE AMAZINGLY WANTING TO- START SERVICES ON THE OTHER SIDE I HAVE HEARD SOME ANECDOTAL YOU KNOW EVIDENCE THAT- PROVIDERS HAVE TAKEN THIS OPPORTUNITY ESPECIALLY AT THE END OF. MAYBE THEIR CAREER IN GROUP HOMES TO TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO RETIRE- WHICH HAS- HAS CREATED DEFINITE CHALLENGES. ONE OF THINGS WE DON'T HAVE IN THIS SYSTEM WHICH WE WOULD LOVE TO WORK. ON IS SOME KIND OF RESCUE HOUSING WHERE AN OWNER OPERATED GROUP HOME- DECIDES IT'S THE END OF THEIR TWENTY OR THIRTY OR MORE YEAR TEN YEAR OF BEING ABLE TO SUPPORT THEIR INDIVIDUALS. WE DON'T REALLY HAVE A MECHANISM TO RESCUE THAT HOUSING UNLESS THAT- OWNER OPERATOR HAS SOMEONE ELSE USUALLY IN THE FAMILY TO PASS IT ON TO IT SO- THAT OBVIOUSLY IS. PART OF THE SOLUTION AND AFFORDABLE AND ACCESSIBLE HOUSING IS A HUGE PART OF THE SOLUTION I THINK IT'S- AS WE MOVE INTO THE FUTURE SET ASIDE FOR PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES AND- AND- AFFORDABLE AND ACCESSIBLE HOUSING A MULTI FAMILY HOUSING WHICH THE DEPARTMENT HAS- OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES HAS SUPPORTED IN MANY AREAS INCLUDING OURS. WILL BE. A ANOTHER PART OF. RELATING NEW UP. FOR FIVE. AS WELL AS MAYBE SOME Mà. STARTED TO YOUR ARM IS ALL YOU KNOW WHAT IN THE SHORT TERM- WE DON'T HAVE A GOOD WAY IT'S BEEN STATED MANY TIMES THIS AFTERNOON. OF HAVING KIND OF UNIFIED CONSISTENT DATA WITHIN THIS- WITH THIS WITHIN THIS SYSTEM SO- I KNOW OUR CREDENTIALS OF A STUDY OF CLOSURES OF. PROGRAMS EVERY YEAR- BUT IT TAKES TIME FOR THAT TO SHOW ANY KIND OF- STATEWIDE DATABASE VIEW OF HOW MANY. HOMES ARE PROVIDERS ARE REALLY CLOSING SO- I THINK THROUGH ALL THE EFFORTS MY FEELING IN OUR AREA WHICH IS EXTREMELY HIGH COSTS SORT OF GROUND ZERO FOR HIGH COSTS. IN THIS IN THE STATE IN THE COUNTRY- THE PROVIDER COMMUNITY- SOMEONE ALREADY MENTIONED HAS BEEN LIMPING ALONG AND- AND- DOING THE BEST THEY CAN- BUT ARE CERTAINLY VULNERABLE ESPECIALLY SMALLPOX WILL PROVIDERS WHO DON'T. HAVE A CONNECTION TO LARGER ORGANIZATIONS BUT MAYBE MAYBE PROVIDING SOME OF THE MOST- SOME OF THE MOST INNOVATIVE AND- RESPONSIVE. PERSON CENTRED SERVICE SINCE. THANK FOR THAT. MISTER KERRISON WHO MENTIONED YOU KNOW I'LL BE INTRODUCING THE NACA TO CREATE A LEVEL FUNDING FOR THE SPECIAL NEEDS POPULATION THROUGH DíAS BUT ALSO CERTIFICATION PROCESS THROUGH THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES SO WE CAN ACTUALLY HAVE A WORKFORCE THAT ACTUALLY HAS A CERTIFICATE AND WE CAN ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO MAKE MORE MONEY BECAUSE OF THIS TRAINING THIS. LOWER WAGE- IS NOT ACCEPTABLE. CARING FOR THE VULNERABLE POPULATION AND WE EXPECT. WE DON'T DO THAT TO ARGUE OR AGING POPULATION WE DON'T DO IT TO ANYBODY ELSE BUT WE DO IT TO THE SPECIAL NEEDS POPULATION WHICH IS A SHAME IT'S A REALLY A SHAME SO WE'LL BE LOOKING I'M HOPING THAT WE ALL CAN COMBINE. ON THIS COULD BE A COMMITTEE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE SURFACE WORKFORCES AND KNOWLEDGE AND PAID A LIVING WAGE. THANK YOU. I'M GOING TO- BEGIN MY COMMENTS BY ACTUALLY THANKING YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRAZIER FOR BEING A LONGTIME CHAMPION IN THIS SPACE AND- JUST WANT TO. EXTEND A PERSONAL APPRECIATION FOR YOUR ADVOCACY HERE TODAY. I'M GONNA FOCUS MY COMMENTS- IN FOUR AREAS FOR THE ADMINISTRATION FIRST ON THE SUSPENSION POLICY NEXT ON PROVIDER RETENTION. ON THE- THIRD ON THE NEXT STEPS IN THE RIGHT STUDY AND FINALLY ON THE COMMUNITY NAVIGATOR PROPOSAL. I'M GONNA BEGIN ON THE SUSPENSION POLICY AND- THE QUESTION IS FOR YOU DIRECTOR BARGE MAN I'M- REALLY WANTING TO DIG IN A LITTLE BIT I THINK WE HEARD CLEARLY TODAY THAT SUSPENSION CREATES UNCERTAINTY AND ANXIETY. WHEN WE NEED STABILITY. IT'S WITH THAT IN MIND THAT I WANTED TO ASK YOU WHAT WOULD BE THE IMPACT OF THE PROVIDER AND IDT COMMUNITY. IF THE SUSPENSION POLICY WENT INTO EFFECT EITHER ON DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY ONE OR DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND HOW DOES THIS RECONCILE WITH ALL OF THE WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE THROUGH THIS PANDEMIC. TO HELP TO PRESERVE THE DDS PROVIDER NETWORK. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER- REGULAR DOCTOR AMBULANCE- I DON'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION HERE BUT HAPPY TO PROVIDE THAT TO YOU SO WE'LL WE'LL HAVE OUR OUR TEAM- TAKE A LOOK AT THAT DETAIL AND PROVIDE IT TO THE COMMITTEE. FOR D. O. F. THEN IF I CAN FOLLOW UP. WHY ARE THESE SUSPENSIONS ALL CONCENTRATED IN THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AREA- EVEN UNDERSTANDING THE ARCHITECTURAL CURTAILING. OF ONGOING SPENDING Y. CONCENTRATES THIS FOCUS ON THE MOST CRITICAL SERVICES FOR THE MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. BUT STILL WELL OR NO FINANCE I THINK YOU CHAIR FOR THE QUESTION SO YOU KNOW I WOULD JUST SAY THAT SINCE THE TWENTY NINETEEN BUDGET ACTORS MEN SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES PROGRAM INVESTMENTS. THESE ARE COSTS WHICH ARE LIKELY TO INCREASE A SLOWING. GROWTH ENDING THESE PROGRAMS IN THE STATE STRUCTURALLY BALANCED BUDGETS SUPPORT MY ONGOING BASIS AND SO THE SUSPENSION SPRING MARKET IS THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL TO ADDRESS THIS IMBALANCE. AND AGAIN THAT THIS IS A DIFFICULT ISSUE AND WE WELCOME CONTINUE DISCUSSIONS LEGISLATURE THE PROPOSAL. I THINK WHAT YOU'RE HEARING FROM MANY OF US IS THAT STRUCTURAL IMBALANCES A GAPING WOUND AND THIS FEELS LIKE A BANDAID THAT WE'RE PUTTING ON FOR IT THESE WORK COMMITMENTS THAT MANY OF US MADE FOR ON GOING PROGRAMS AND- JUST WANT TO ELEVATE AGAIN THE NECESSITY FOR US TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS THIS YEAR. I'D LIKE TO NOW MOVE ON IF I CAN TO THE PROVIDER RETENTION AND FOR THE DEPARTMENT WHAT IS YOUR BEST ASSESSMENT OF STRATEGIES TO HELP TO RETAIN. AND KEEP THE TALENTS THAT WE HAVE WITHIN THE DDS WORK FORCE AND DOES IT INCLUDE IMPROVED WAGES GROWING THE WORK FORCE TO REDUCE THE DEMANDS ON A SINGLE WORKER. AND MORE FLEXIBILITIES. FOR WORK LIFE BALANCE. THANK YOU DR ARAMBULA YOU KNOW TALKING AND LISTENING- CERTAINLY TO THE PROVIDERS AND- WE ARE OUR DIRECT SERVICE PROFESSIONALS AND THEY ARE REALLY THOSE THAT ARE WORKING DAY TODAY WITH THE INDIVIDUALS THAT WE SERVE- I STARTED MY CAREER AS A DRUG SERVICE PROFESSIONAL- I CERTAINLY DON'T- HAVE THE YEARS OF EXPERIENCE THAT MANY OF THEM HAVE DEDICATED THEIR LIVES- TO PROVIDING THE SUPPORT AS- JACKIE HAD SHARED EARLIER IN HER TESTIMONY ABOUT- DOES THAT THEY SUPPORT. AND HAVE DEDICATED AND IT'S REALLY SACRIFICE SOME OF THEIR TIMES IT'S REALLY MOVING TO SEE THOSE WORK. IT IS IMPORTANT FOR US TO CONTINUE TO EVALUATE OUR SYSTEM AS IT'S BEEN- SAID TO TAKE A LOOK AT IS THERE AN OPPORTUNITY HERE AS- AS WE FACE THIS PANDEMIC- AND FINDING- ARE STRATEGIES THAT HAVE BEEN A BENEFIT- TO BE ABLE TO HELP NAVIGATE I. WELL I DON'T HAVE A PARTICULAR STRATEGIES- WE ARE COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH OUR- TASK FORCE BUT ALSO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE IN CONVERSATIONS ABOUT WHAT ARE THE THINGS THAT WE CAN DO AND LOOKING AT OUR POST AND THEN MAKE- FUTURE- WHAT WHAT IS KIND OF THAT. YOU KNOW WE STARTED THIS CONVERSATION ABOUT SIX MONTHS AGO AND REALIZED IT WAS TOO SOON TO BE ABLE TO AND I THINK WE ARE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF IT- BUT- WE NEED TO REIMAGINE SOME EFFORTS AND REALLY- UC'S OPPORTUNITIES TO SAY HOW DO WE STABILIZE. THE SERVICE DELIVERY SYSTEM POST PANDEMIC AND THAT SHOULD. INCLUDE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE WORK FORCE AND- REALLY DO HOPE THAT OUR OUR STAFF THAT ARE OUT THERE EVERY DAY ARE GETTING SOME WORK LIFE BALANCE BECAUSE I KNOW THERE'S BEEN A VERY DIFFICULT. ABOUT EARLIER WE HEARD OF THE NEED FOR US TO BUILD BACK BETTER AND- I REALLY BELIEVE THAT BRINGS US INTO A CONVERSATION ABOUT NEXT STEPS IN TERMS OF THE RATE STUDY. I WANTED THE FIRST TASK IS THE RATE STUDY OUR NORTH STAR HOW ARE WE- WORKING TOWARDS ACHIEVING THAT TRADE STUDY. AND WHAT WOULD WHAT DIRECTIONS WITH THE BURDEN STUDY NATURALLY POINTS TO US AS A NEXT STEP IN RATES IMPROVEMENTS. IF ONE COULD BE CONSIDERED. YEAH THANK YOU- DOCTOR AMBULANCE SO- WE DON'T HAVE A STRATEGY OR PLAN AT THIS TIME FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RATE STUDY BUT AS WE HAVE. I'M USED TO PRIOR- CONVERSATIONS IN THE LAST COUPLE YEARS- WE REALLY ARE FOCUSED ON USING THE INFORMATION THAT HAS INFORMED US ON SOME REALLY CRITICAL PARTS ABOUT OUR SYSTEM- I DO SEE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO TAKE A LOOK AT. HOW DO WE GET TO A STRATEGY OF DELIVERING SERVICES- IN A WAY THAT IS REALLY FOCUSED ON OUTCOMES AND PERSON- FOCUSED AND- THE INFORMATION THAT HAS ALSO BEEN PROVIDED TO US THROUGH THE RATE STUDY IS INFORMATIVE AND SHOULD HELP US IN IN GUIDING OUR CONVERSATIONS- SO AGAIN WE LOOK FORWARD TO. KIND OF DIVING INTO SOME OF THOSE DETAILS. WE HAVE A COMPLICATED SYSTEM. I'M AND THAT COMPLICATED SYSTEM- GOT MAGNIFIED BY THE PANDEMIC- AND WE DO NEED TO PRIORITIZE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE STRATEGIES GOING FORWARD- AND LOOK FORWARD TO ENGAGING IN THOSE DISCUSSIONS WITH- OUR. COMMUNITY AND WITH THE LEGISLATURE. I FOUND IT- POWERFUL WHEN WE HEARD EARLIER THAT HISTORICAL UNDERFUNDING MADE IMPLEMENTATION DIFFICULT DURING THIS PANDEMIC I THINK THAT'S- AN IMPORTANT PART FOR US TO OWN AS A STATE- IN THIS CONVERSATION AND HOPE WE CAN TAKE TO- NEXT STEPS TOGETHER AND- REALIZING THIS RATE STUDY IN THE NEED FOR IT WITHIN OUR SYSTEM. I WOULD LIKE TO END IF I CAN ON THE COMMUNITY NAVIGATOR PROPOSAL I WAS QUITE PLEASED WITH IT AND- IF I CAN I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THE SUB COMMITTEE RECEIVE A COPY OF THE PROMO TORA EVALUATION WHICH WAS REFERENCED AS JUSTIFICATION FOR THIS PROPOSAL. BUT WANTED TO ASK THE- ADMINISTRATION IF I COULD HOW DID YOU ARRIVE AT THIS NUMBER FOR THE INVESTMENT TEND TO THE ARGUMENT TO BE MADE FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR THIS PURPOSE AND IF NOT WHY NOT. YES MAY BE HAPPY TO PROVIDE THE COMMITTEE- THE STUDY THAT IS REFERENCED AND I'M ON THE ASSUMPTIONS WE CAN PROVIDE THAT- MORE OF THE DETAIL DISPENSED BUT BROADLY. I'LL TELL YOU THAT WHEN WE ARE LOOKING AT- THE PROPOSAL THAT WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE TOUCH ALL TWENTY ONE GEOGRAPHIC AREAS AND SO THE ASSUMPTION IS BASED ON TWENTY ONE- PHYSICIANS IF YOU WILL AND THEN SUPPORT OF AS FAR AS LIKE OVERHEAD AND OTHER KIND OF SUPPORTED ANCILLARY- EXPENSES THAT WOULD BE RELATED TO THAT- AND THEN ALSO LOOKING AT MAKING SURE AS WE HAD NOTED THAT IT WOULD BE. DIRECTED TO YOUR FAMILY RESOURCE CENTERS- WHICH WOULD BE FURTHER DEFINED THROUGH GUIDANCE AS FAR AS- IT JUST SMALL- IT'S ONE OF THE AREAS THAT I WAS REALLY WANTING TO DO WAS TO STANDARDIZE SOMETHING ACROSS THE STATE SO WHAT WOULD ALLOW US TIME TO BE A- ABLE TO EVALUATE- IT WAS NOTED ABOUT WHAT ARE THE AREAS IN WHICH WE'RE GOING TO USE. AS OUR- MEASURES- UP FRONT SO WE'RE ABLE TO REALLY MONITOR THE SUCCESS AND THE OUTCOMES ON THAT COULD HELP INFORM US AS TO OPPORTUNITIES FOR FURTHER EXPANSION OR MODIFICATION- REGARDING BECAUSE I'M I AM HOPEFUL THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE VERY SUCCESSFUL- SO THIS WILL HELP- BY HAVING JUST. THE STANDARD THAT WE PUT FORWARD IT WILL HELP US AND BE INFORMED TO ON THE THINGS THAT WE WOULD NEED TO MODIFY- BEFORE WE WOULD MOVE FORWARD. WITH THAT DISHMOK PROPOSAL.

MY NAME IS PATTY MORAN WITH ALPHA RESOURCE CENTER SERVING SANTA BARBARA COUNTY WERE APPARENT DIRECTED FAMILY RESOURCE CENTER STAFFED BY PARENTS A PURCHASER FIRE LOCAL REGIONAL CENTER. I'M HERE TO URGE YOUR SUPPORT OF THE COMMUNITY NAVIGATOR PROPOSAL LAST YEAR WE SERVED OVER FIVE HUNDRED SIXTY EIGHT INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILY MEMBERS SERVED BY TRI COUNTIES REGIONAL CENTER IN CULVER HEALTH OF THOSE SERVICES WERE PROVIDED TO THOSE. WHO ARE PRIMARILY NON ENGLISH SPEAKERS WHILE PARENT TO PARENT SUPPORT IS THE FOUNDATION OF ALL WE DO MOST OF OUR RELATIONSHIP START WITH A FAMILY MEMBER CALLING FOR HELP WITH ACCESSING SERVICES. WE ENSURE INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES HAVE THE HELP THEY NEED TO NAVIGATE THE VERY SYSTEMS AND SERVICES THAT ARE IN PLACE.

WITH OUR SO THAT THEY CAN THE- TO ENSURE THOSE ANIMALS I. APART AREA WE NEED SERVICES. FOR THANK YOU AND THAT COMES FROM LINE EIGHTY EIGHT LINE EIGHTY YOUR LINE IS OPEN. HI YES THANK YOU MY NAME IS CHRISTINA CANTARELLA- AND- I AM THE- OF REGISTERED NURSE AND A PARENT ADVOCATE FOR DISABILITY COMMUNITY IN THOSE WITH COMPLEX MEDICAL NEEDS- DOCTOR ARIK. ARAMBULA THANK YOU FOR BRINGING UP THE IMPORTANT QUESTION REGARDING THE VACCINE IN THE POSSIBILITY OF MOVING THAT MARCH FIFTEENTH DATE UP- I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS OCCURRING HERE'S WHY. IN EARLY JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY I SPENT EIGHTY THAT THE BAD SIDE OF MY TWENTY TWO YEAR OLD SON JOHNNY AS HE LAY INTUBATED ON A VENTILATOR IN THE ICU FROM AN UNKNOWN ILLNESS. MOST LIKELY WAS COLD IT NOW KNOWING THAT WE KNOW ABOUT THIS WHAT NOW KNOWING WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THIS VIRUS. I KNOW HOW FIRSTHAND HOW QUICKLY AND SEVERELY PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES AND COMPLEX MEDICAL NEEDS CAN BECOME SICK. I FEEL STRONGLY THAT THE VACCINE SHOULD INCLUDE PEOPLE WITH ALL DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES BECAUSE SO OFTEN IT IS VERY DIFFICULT FOR OUR COMMUNITY TO EXPRESS WHEN THEY DO NOT FEEL WELL AND OFTEN TIMES IT IS NOT UNTIL THEY'RE EXTREMELY SICK. THAT THEIR CARE GIVERS REALIZE SOMETHING IS WRONG. I'M GRATEFUL TO BE IN MINUTES. THAT THEY DECIDED TO INCLUDE SOME OF OUR DISABILITY COMMUNITY. AS WE HEARD EARLIER SINCE DECEMBER TWO MONTHS AGO THE DEATH RATE FOR REGIONAL CENTER CONSUMERS HAS RISEN SUBSTANTIALLY. WAITING UNTIL MARCH FIFTEENTH MEANS THAT IF. THE PERSON WITH THE DISABILITY IS ABLE TO GET VACCINATED ON THAT DAY IT WOULD BE A MINIMUM OF NINE TO TEN WEEKS. BEFORE THAT PERSON WOULD BE FULLY VACCINATED AND SAVED FROM SERIOUS HEALTH COMPLICATIONS. BECAUSE OF THE LIMITED AMOUNT OF VACCINE RIGHT NOW I WOULD RECOMMEND THAT THE ADMINISTRATION RECONSIDER THE ELIGIBILITY ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS AND PUT A TEMPORARY HOLD ON VACCINE DISTRIBUTION EXCEPT FOR ESSENTIAL FRONTLINE HEALTH CARE WORKERS. PEOPLE WITH MEDICAL ISSUES WHO ARE AT HIGHEST RISK OF BEING HOSPITALIZED AND DYING FROM COLD IT INCLUDING- SIXTY FIVE YEARS AND OLDER AND THOSE WITH DISABILITIES HAVE MEDICAL ISSUES AND OR HAVE DIFFICULTY EXPRESSING THEIR HEALTHCARE NEEDS. NOT ONLY WOULD THIS PROVIDE HEALTH EQUITY FOR DISABILITY COMMUNITY WHICH IS SO OFTEN FORGOTTEN BUT IT WOULD ALSO BE COST EFFECTIVE TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BY DECREASING THE AMOUNT OF ER VISITS AND HOSPITALIZATIONS BY MEDICARE RECIPIENTS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU MA'AM NEXT CALLER PLEASE. AND THAT'S LINE FIFTY SEVEN LINE FIFTY SEVEN PLEASE GO AHEAD.

A DIRECT SUPPORT PROFESSIONAL AT THAT TIME. AND WE STARTED AROUND EIGHT DOLLARS AND FIFTY CENTS AN HOUR WHICH WAS DOUBLE ABOUT DOUBLE THE CALIFORNIA MINIMUM WAGE. NOW WE'RE STARTING EMPLOYEE TO FIFTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR. WHICH IS A TOTAL BUDGETARY STRETCH FOR US AND HARD TO DO. AND THAT IS A YOU KNOW FIFTEEN DOLLARS IS. BEING CONSIDERED SORT OF A BASIC MINIMUM WAGE THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES. I THINK THAT. WHAT I'VE SEEN OVER MY THIRTY THREE YEARS IN THE FIELD IS. A MOVE AWAY FROM THE IDEA OF A PROFESSIONAL LIFE STAFF AND WE'RE JUST REALLY TRYING TO CLAW BACK TO THAT STATUS. AND THAT ARE. FINANCED THAT HAVE DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES DESERVE THAT.

THE CO CHAIR OF THE A LEGISLATIVE COALITION REPRESENTING STAKEHOLDERS OF ALL TIMES TOP ADVOCATES FAMILIES PARENTS WHILE SERVICE PROVIDERS TO REGIONAL CENTER CITY COUNCIL. IN THE STATE. AND WHAT I WANTED DO FIRST WAS A- JUST COMING DIRECTLY ON. HOW WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO. TOGETHER BY PROMOTING ERA PLUS. AND ADAPTABILITY AND FLEXIBILITY AS ART MY COLLEAGUES GOAL SAID IN HIS COMMENTS WE WANT TO BUILD BACK BETTER. AND SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE CAN DO TO TAKE THOSE STEPS TO DO THAT. IS TO SUPPORT THE ELIMINATION OF THIS NEED 20% DISPENSED ONE. WE ALSO LIKE TO REALLY KIND OF UNDERSCORE THE IMPORTANCE OF CONTINUING TO EXAMINE OUR SYSTEM. AND THE REFORM EFFORTS THERE AND SO THAT WE CAN ADDRESS THESE HUGE ISSUES THAT ALL OF THE PANELISTS EVERYBODY ON THESE CALLS HAS DISCUSSED. HOW DO WE CREATE MEASURABLE OUTCOMES.

VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME APPRECIATE IT. THANK YOU SIR NEXT CALLER PLEASE. AND THAT COMES FROM A LINE SEVENTY FOUR PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD EVENING MY NAME IS LINDA LANDRY- APPARENT AND I'M CALLING FROM LOS ANGELES. AND I JUST WANTED TO THROW MY HAT IN THE RING TO SAY HOW HAPPY I AM TO HEAR ABOUT THE- STATEWIDE COMMUNITY NAVIGATORS PROGRAM I CAME INTO THIS SYSTEM THIRTY SOME YEARS AGO. HELLO MY DAUGHTER WAS DIAGNOSED WITH THEIR REAL RARE CHROMOSOME ANOMALY AND- I HAVE WORKED IN THE SYSTEM FOR TEN YEARS I SPEAK ENGLISH I KNOW SYSTEMS AND IT WAS REALLY HARD TO NAVIGATE. AND FROM THE MOMENT SHE MOMENT SHE WAS IDENTIFIED AND I JOINED A PARENT SUPPORT GROUP I WAS ON THE BAND WAGON FOR FAMILY SUPPORT. WELL WAS ONE OF THE FOUNDING FATHERS OF THE FAMILY RESOURCE CENTER NETWORK OF CALIFORNIA. AND OUR BIGGEST PIECE IT WAS TO. IT FIRST BILL NICE. PROVIDE. SERVICES AND RESOURCES AND SUPPORT IN THEIR CHOSEN LANGUAGE. INITIATE PARENT LEADERSHIP AND TO GET ALL THAT GOING IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY WE HAVE SEVEN REGIONAL CENTERS I HEARD THE COMMENTS ABOUT IT'S INTERPRETED DIFFERENT AND EACH ONE MANY TIMES AND I'M ON THE BORDERLINE SO I HAVE A REGIONAL CENTER ACROSS THE STREET DIFFERENT THAN THE ONE I HAVE HERE MY HOUSE. SO THE NAVIGATOR SYSTEM IS JUST THE PROGRAM IS JUST SOMETHING THAT IS A WONDERFUL INVESTMENT AND IT'S AN INVESTMENT OF FAMILIES HAVE BEEN INVESTMENT. AND HAVING MORE LEADERSHIP WITH FAMILIES AND HAVING THEM- GET THE GAIN THE ABILITY TO BE MAKING INFORMED. DECISIONS ON THEIR CHILD- SERVICES AND HOPEFULLY WITH SELF DETERMINATION. THAT- CONSUMER WILL MAKE THEIR OWN INFORMED DECISIONS LATER ON SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR GOOD WORK GOOD LUCK. THANK YOU MA'AM LAWLER PLEASE. AND I COME FROM LINE ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY EIGHT PLEASE GO AHEAD. HI THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO GIVE INPUT MY NAME IS CONNIE FRIEND SO- OF THE FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE SAN FRANCISCO OFFICE OF SOCIETY A FORMER COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH NURSE WHO. USED TO RUN VACCINE CLINICS AND- AND MY MOM OF THE THIRTY THREE YEAR OLD SON WITH AUTISM I WOULD LOVE TO GIVE YOU SOME COMMENTS- STANDS- I APPRECIATE THE INPUT THAT YOU'RE GIVING ME TIME FOR. SORRY I'M GOING TO TURN OFF THE- PLEASE FORGIVE ME. ANYWAY I WON TO TALK ABOUT WITH DANCING BARGMANN MENTION IN IN TERMS OF THE HELP TO IN TERMS OF GIVING PRIORITY TO ARE DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED. I'D LIKE TO SAY SUGGEST THAT WE KEEP IT SIMPLE WHAT ERIN CARUTHERS SENSE- SAID MADE A LOT OF SENSE TO ME IN OTHER WORDS. ALL THE REGIONAL CENTER CLIENTS SHOULD BE GIVEN PRIORITY THEY ARE ALL HIGH RISK AND SO I THINK IF WE COULD JUST EVEN HAVE A LETTER FROM DDS OF THE REGIONAL CENTRE STATING THAT THERE ARE- DDS CLIENTS. THAT COULD SIMPLIFY THINGS IN TERMS OF GIVING THEM PRIORITY. US SEPARATELY AND LIKE TO SEE SOME SPECIALIZED CLINICS IF NEEDED I'M TALKING ABOUT THE DRIVE THROUGH CLINIC FOR THOSE WHO WERE. PERHAPS BEHAVIORALLY CHALLENGED THAT THAT WOULD- MAKE IT MUCH EASIER FOR PARENTS- I WATCHED THE OTHER DAY AT THE COUNTY FAIRGROUNDS A MOTHER STRUGGLING WITH HER SON HE WAS A TEENAGER HE OBVIOUSLY HAD A LOT TO THEM HE WAS TRYING TO RUN AWAY. I THINK SEEM SHE WAS TRYING TO GET HER VACCINE. AND HER JUST TRIED TO KEEP HIM IN LINE IN THESE LONG LINES IT REALLY WAS VERY- DIFFICULT I WANTED TO GO OUT AND HELP HER. SO IF WE COULD HELP THEM SPECIAL CLINICS MAY BE PUT ON THROUGH THE REGIONAL CENTERS LIKE THEY'RE CURRENTLY DOING THEY'RE- THEY'RE DISTRIBUTING P. P. ET WHY NOT HELP THEM DRIVE GROUP OF VACCINE CLINICS. FOR THOSE WHO NEED IT- THIRDLY I'D LIKE ADDRESS THAT. HAS A IN THE KEY GIVE AND TALKING ABOUT CARE GIVERS IN GROUP HOMES OR SUPPORTED LIVING. RESPITE WORKERS ANY OTHER CONGREGATE SETTINGS. WHAT I'VE OBSERVED AND IN FACT IN MY OWN WITH MY OWN SON SOME OF THEM ARE REFUSING TO GET VACCINATED NOW THIS IS PUTTING THEMSELVES AT RISK AND ALSO PUTTING OUR CLIENTS THEY'RE CARING FOR AT RISK. IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE A REQUIREMENT FOR TUBERCULOSIS BEFORE YOU CAN WORK IN A HOSPITAL OR WHATEVER YOU NEED TO TB CLEARANCE BUT WITH CORONA WITH THE CODE THAT WE DON'T HAVE ANY SORT OF REQUIREMENTS AND ACTUALLY- CODE IS A LOT MORE COMMUNICABLE BENCHMARKING LOS'S. LIKE TO ASK- PEOPLE HERE TO DISCUSS HOW WE CAN. HELP REMOVE THESE BARRIERS I KNOW SOME OF ITS CULTURAL SOME OF ITS PEOPLE ARE JUST AFRAID LACK OF KNOWLEDGE BUT- TO COME UP WITH SOME INCENTIVES IN TERMS OF- HELPING PEOPLE WHO ARE RELUCTANT WHO ARE IN CARE GIVING ROLES TO GET A VACCINE. I MEAN WE MIGHT NEED TO CONSIDER MAKING IT MANDATORY JUST SIMPLY AS WE DO WITH TUBERCULOSIS WE REQUIRE PEOPLE IF THEY WANT A JOB. THEY HAVE TO GET A TB CLEARANCE AND WE MIGHT HAVE TO GO TO WITHOUT CONSIDERING THE VARIANCE. AND THE RISKS HERE I WOULD STRONGLY URGE YOU TO DISCUSS THIS ISSUE AS WELL. IN MY OWN HOUSEHOLD- THIS WAS BEFORE WE HAD THE VACCINE ONE OF THE CARE GIVERS CUTS CORONA AND IT WAS VERY SCARY FOR ME BECAUSE I HAD THE OTHER CARE GIVERS SAYING WELL WE'RE NOT SURE WE WANT TO SHOW UP TO WORK ANYMORE. AND SO THIS IS A REAL ISSUE AND I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND ALLOWING ME TO GIVE INPUT. THANKS THANK YOU MA'AM. THANKS CALLER PLEASE. AND ACTIVISTS LINE ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY PLEASE GO AHEAD.

I'M THANK YOU EVERYONE FOR HAVING TO- HEARING AND FOR TAKING OUR PUBLIC COMMENT. I'M I WANTED TO ADDRESS MY COMMENTS TO- DIRECTOR PARCHMENT MY NAME IS PATRICIA ALBANIA AND I'M HEARING MYSELF OF ANY SIXTEEN YEAR OLD ON THE AUTISM SPECTRUM I AM ALSO A STRONG ADVOCATE FOR- A SPANISH SPEAKING COMMUNITY CHURCH I'M IN MY FIRST CONCERN- WHICH REGARDING THE LETTER THAT CAME OUT DID IT JANUARY THIRTEENTH HALF OF WHERE IT WAS- YOU KNOW OUR- FAMILIES WHERE FAMILY MEMBERS WERE TOLD THAT. IF WE HAVE ANY- CLIENT THAT'S PART OF THE REGIONAL CENTER- WE COULD QUALIFY FOR THE VACCINE AND IT WAS VERY SPECIFIC- IN REGARDS TO THE DIAGNOSIS THAT I AM QUALIFIED. AND SO MY FIRST CONCERN REGARDING THIS LETTER WAS THAT THE LETTER I WILL NEVER I NEVER SIDE IN SPANISH. AND GOING BACK TO THE POINT THAT JUDY MARC SNEYD- YEAR- A LOT OF THE INFORMATION DID NOT GET PASSED ON TO EVERYBODY SO A LOT OF PEOPLE EITHER DID NOT RECEIVE THE LETTER OR THE LETTER WHICH NOT IN SPANISH SO I FEEL THAT A LOT OF THE SPANISH SPEAKING POPULATION. BUT NOT AWARE JUSTICE THAT THIS WAS HAPPENING- MY CONCERN REGARDING THEIR IN FACT IT HAS BEEN MADE CLEAR TO ME AT LEAST WHEN I ASKED THE QUESTION THAT AUTISM DOES NOT FALL UNDER. THE CATEGORIES HERE- OUTLANDISH LETTERS HOWEVER WE HAVE HEARD THAT THERE ARE FAMILY MEMBERS THAT HAVE BEEN AT LEAST EATING THE VACCINE WHEN THERE ARE CHILDREN ONLY HAVING ANY DIAGNOSES AND FELL. I'M JUST I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE TAKE THIS INTO ACCOUNT BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF CONFUSION THAT IT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW AND IT'S VERY TYPICAL TO STUFF THAT HAPPENS- WHEN WE REQUEST FOR SERVICES EITHER FROM THAT SCHOOL DISTRICT ARE FOR REGIONAL CENTERS WHERE SAM FAMILIES GET THE SUPPORT AND OTHER FAMILIES DO NOT IN THIS CASE. SOME FAMILIES WE HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT IF OUR CHILD ONLY HAS AN AUTISM DIAGNOSIS AND WE DON'T QUALIFY BASED ON THE LETTER THAT CAME OUT FROM AND PBS WHERE OTHER FAMILIES HAVE ALREADY RECEIVED THE VACCINE AND IN THE FUTURE ALLEN- SUPPORT JUST HAVING. MY CLARITY- BY STUFF LIKE THAT THAT'S PUT OUT TO FAMILY. MEMBERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU MA'AM MCCULLAR. AND THAT COMES TO MIND SO PLEASE GO AHEAD. SH SH. ONE FIFTY YOUR LINE IS OPEN.

THE QUESTION ARE THE FOLLOWING. WHAT IS THE PRODUCT. WHAT ARE THE LOS AND RESTORE. THAT HAVE BEEN GIVEN TO THE FIRE. WHAT HAD BEEN SMALLER UP. TO IS THAT ARE COMMUNITY IS NOT EVEN WITH ALL OF THE COPY CASE. BECAUSE ON MANY OCCASIONS BILL COURTED IT HAPPENS AT THE BILL EVERYBODY ARE IN MEDIA ANY WITHDRAWAL NOBODY WANTS TO HELP THE FAMILIES. IN MY OPINION THEIR FAMILIES ARE BEING PENALIZED FOR BEING SICK AND THE LAST THING IS THEY- ALWAYS TALK ABOUT THE QUALITY AND QUANTITY BUT THE COMMUNITY WHAT I'LL DO SOME ON ALL THE DISABILITIES WHAT EXCLUDED FROM THE FIRST. PHASE BACK THE NATION AS WELL AS NOW IS BEING IS BEING EXCLUDED FOR THE ELIGIBILITY. FOR OUR WAR ELECT NOT FEEL SPECIAL OUT OF TOWN I'M SORRY BUT THIS TO ME MIGHT WALK OUT TO SOME IT'S ALL DOES NOT.

IN JUNE OR JULY I BELIEVE AND I AT THIS MOMENT- ACTUALLY BOTH OF MY CHILDREN ARE IN SELF DETERMINATION AND WE'VE HAD SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES WITH- GETTING- EVERYTHING IN PLACE AND- TRANSPLANTATION FROM THE TRADITIONAL SYSTEM. INTO FAULT DETERMINATION AND IT. IN MY EXPERIENCE OF. NOT ONLY NAVIGATING SYSTEMS OF CARE WITH MY OWN CHILDREN BUT SUPPORTING COMMUNITY AND FAMILY MEMBERS. I THINK ONE OF THE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES THOSE ARE OUR SERVICE COORDINATORS ARE REGIONAL CENTERS ARE NOT ADEQUATELY PREPARED. AND THAT IS REALLY IMPACTING THE WAY BOB FOR PROGRAMMING- BEING IMPLEMENTOR LOT BEING IMPLEMENTED. OUT PROPERLY- ANOTHER ISSUE THAT I SEE THAT I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO BE ATTRACTIVE I KNOW FOR YEARS I'VE ACTUALLY BEEN PARTICIPATED IN ADVOCACY DAY IN GOING UP WITH MY PARTICULAR REGIONAL CENTER TO ADVOCATE. FOR MORE SERVICE COORDINATORS. IT REALLY IMPACT THE DELIVERY SERVICE AND IT REALLY IMPACTED AGREES COMMUNITIES LIKE AFRICAN AMERICAN AND LATINO COMMUNITIES WHO ARE REALLY AT. A DISADVANTAGE WHEN IT COMES TO GETTING THE ADEQUATE SUPPORT AND SERVICES. NOW HAVING SIGNIFICANT CASELOAD IT HAS BEEN A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE FOR A LOT OF SERVICE COORDINATORS AND NOW THAT WE ARE TRANSITIONING FROM FAMILIES INTO PUBLIC TERMINATION AND THEN OPENING IT UP AND MORE AND MORE WIDE SCALE. I DON'T SEE THEM BEING ABLE TO MANAGE IT WITH THE CARE AND- YOU KNOW HOW THINGS NEED TO BE IMPLEMENTED AND IT'S JUST IT'S I WOULD LOVE TO SEE. THAT BE ADDRESSED WHERE WE HAVE YOU KNOW THE RECORD READERS AND THEIR CASE LOCAL REDUCE BUT ALSO. BETTER TRAINING FOR THEM ABOUT THE DIRECTIVE THAT ARE COMING OUT I HEAR A LOT.

THAT WE EXPERIENCED DURING THE POST COLD IT IS THAT MYSELF MY FAMILY DID CONTRACT- COLD IT- MY HUSBAND IS AN ESSENTIAL WORKERS SO HE THE ONE THAT BROUGHT IT. HOME UNFORTUNATELY THROUGH US WE BELIEVE. AND- IN THE PROCESS OF GETTING MY ELDEST SON TESTED TO SEE IF HE HAD SOLD IT- WE HAD SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES- EVEN THOUGH THE NURSES THEIR WORK TRYING TO BE COOPERATIVE AND FLEXIBLE AND EVEN HAD ME. ADMINISTER THE TESTS HE WAS VERY FRIGHTENED HE SAW THE WHOLE PEOPLE GET UP FOR THE NURSES AND EQUALITY FOR DEMOCRACY WAS MEANT BAYERN MENTAL EVEN TRY DOING IT IN MY CAR IT JUST WOULD NOT BE WORKING. THERE NEEDS TO BE A PLAN. FOR ADULT OR EVEN CHILDREN THAT HAVE SENSORY ISSUES THAT ARE FIGHT THEM BECAUSE IT'S NOT WHATEVER IS HAPPENING NOW NOT WORKING AND MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER MAYBE EVEN GOING TO WANT HOME. OR MAYBE THEIR PROGRAM THAT WHAT HAPPENING NOW IS NOT WORKING SO IF YOU WANT TO EXCLUDE A POPULATION THIS IS THE PERFECT WAY OF DOING IT IS NOT DOING ANYTHING ABOUT IT- I THOUGHT IF I AM HAVING TROUBLE. THEIR GETTING HIM TESTED. WOULD BE IF YOU HAVE HOPE IT. I DON'T KNOW HOW IN THE WORLD I'M GOING TO GET A VACCINATED- STUDIES ARE SHOWING THAT- OUR POPULATION IS VERY VULNERABLE WHEN IT COMES TO GETTING ILL AND GETTING HOSPITALIZED- I THINK GETTING WORSE BECAUSE MY SON IS- YOU'RE NOT ABLE TO USE IT FOR IF YOU DO A MACHINE. TO COMMUNICATE. SO HE'S NOT ABLE TO TELL ME WHAT HURT WHAT AILED HIM- SO IT'S VERY CHALLENGING TO GET HIM INTO EMERGENCY ARGUMENT. DR ON. A GOOD DAY- SO THAT IS ANOTHER CHALLENGE- IN OVER ONE FAMILY GET. WELL THAT. ON THE PORCH THE FOUNDING FOR. MORE THAN PVP BECAUSE BY THAT TIME IT LATE. HE V.

TRANSLATING THIS INFORMATION IN SPANISH THERE'S NO EXCUSE. YOU CAN THROW A ROCK AND HIT SOMEBODY THAT CAN SPEAK SPANISH THE QUALITY TRANSLATE. INTO MAKING IT- SO- AND THAT'S KINDA FOR I HOPE CHANGE SOON- AND ALSO THE RATE HAS A VERY. THESE ARE NOT MINIMUM WAGE JOBS FOR CHRISTMAS THAT WORK WITH OUR POPULATION. THEY CARE ABOUT OUR FOLKS AND THEY WANT TO WORK WITH OUR FOLKS. BUT IF THEY DON'T HAVE A LEADING WAIT.

HAVE A NICE EVENING. THANK YOU MA'AM. NEXT CALLER PLEASE. AND THAT COMES FROM LINE ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY ONE FORTY PLEASE GO AHEAD. THAT LINE WILL BE ME THIS IS AGAIN IF IT'S GONNA- I JUST WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW ONE THING THAT I FEEL THIS IS HOW I GET TO REGIONAL CENTER HAVE YOU EVER GONE TO A RESTAURANT. AND DON'T HAVE THE MANY. BETTER EXACTLY WHAT WE GENERAL FUND OUR FIELD WHAT. BECAUSE THEY TELL YOU THAT EVERYTHING IS INDIVIDUALIZED. THAT IT'S GOING TO BE ACCORDING TO THE SERVICES THAT THEY FEEL IS RIGHT BY THE PROFESSIONAL BY THE SERVICE COORDINATOR I FOUND THAT EVERY TIME I'VE COME ACROSS. QUESTIONS THEY DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER THEY DON'T KNOW. I'VE ASKED HEY YOU KNOW I ONLY GET. A HUNDRED DOLLARS FROM AT THE SIDE BECAUSE I ACTUALLY WORK. AND I'M AFRAID THAT IF I COULD MAKE MORE MONEY I WILL NOT BE ABLE TO HAVE MY TONGUE OVERED BY THE INSURANCE ON THE STATE INSURANCE. CAN YOU FIGURE OUT THE INFORMATION CAN YOU GUIDE ME THROUGH THE PROCESS I CAME TO FIND OUT THAT THERE IS SOMETHING CALLED- A WAIVER. THAT WAS NEVER BROUGHT UP. I WAS ON A JOB THAT I COULDN'T LEAVE BECAUSE I HAVE TO PROVIDE FOR MY FAMILY. AND I WAS NEVER INFORMED TO ME I'VE ASKED THEM I WANT TO TAKE A JOB CAN YOU FIGURE OUT. HOW WILL THIS AFFECT ME AND HE WILL BE ELIGIBLE NOBODY GETS TO ME. LIKE GET BACK TO ME I ASKED HEY I'VE NEVER RECEIVED A FOR- ANY PUBLIC PURCHASES FROM. FROM REGIONAL FINALLY BEING CAUGHT MY FAMILY HELPING A CLIENT BECAUSE EVERYTHING THAT IS DONE FOR MY CHILD. MY FAMILY SO IT HAPPENS TO US. I NEVER RECEIVED ANY PROOF OF PURCHASE THEIR FOR ANNUAL BUDGET OR ANYTHING I SIGNED UP TO BE A INDEPENDENT FACILITATOR OVER A YEAR AGO. I WASN'T REALLY LOOKING INTO THAT NOW THAT I HAVE TO TRY MY ONE AND I ASKED THEM IT HAS BEEN ALMOST FORTY DAYS I SENT AN EMAIL. TO THE PERSON WHO'S IN CHARGE OF THAT. YOU NEVER GOT BACK TO ME. SO RICHARD WHAT I'M HAPPENING WE HAVE THE RESOURCES WE HAVE A MENU. BUT IT'S FINE IF ANTI BECAUSE SOMEBODY'S KEEPING IT HIDDEN. SO WE ARE COMING ACROSS EVERY SINGLE AREA OF POSSIBLE BY REGIONAL CENTER BECAUSE THEY DON T. BIGELOW UNDER THE UMBRELLA THAT. EVERYTHING IS INDIVIDUALIZED YES. EVERY TIME I ASK FOR HELP. SO CAN SOMEBODY MAKE THAT PUBLIC INFORMATION CAN WE HAVE THE OPTION IT ONLY HAD LITTLE KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION ON WHAT IT IS SAID THE REGIONAL CENTER WILL DO FOR FAMILIES BECAUSE I'M TERRIFIED OF EVER GRANTED ANY TYPE OF. WHAT OUR OVER MY TELL WHEN I'M GONE WHY BECAUSE THEY ARE FAILING ME AND I'M NOT LOOKING FOR MY CHILD WHAT IS IT GONNA HAPPEN WHEN I'M NOT HERE AND I DON'T HAVE AND THAT IS THAT IT'S REALLY CHILLY. EIGHT HELPING MY CHILD SUCCEED IN LIFE. THAT IS WHAT REGIONAL CENTER KILLED BY AND- HONESTLY IF YOU'RE GOING TO GIVE THEM ALL OPEN ALL THAT MANY OF THE FUNDING. MAKE THEM ACCOUNTABLE.BECAUSE IT'S NOT FAIR FOR FAMILIES. I'M SORRY COMING ACROSS TOO STRONG. BUT THE FUTURE OF MY CHILD. THIS IS THE HUMAN BEING THAT I LOVE. I LOVE ALL. I NEED NEEDS TO BE KNOWN BECAUSE YOU CAN BE GIVEN ALL THAT MONEY AND HAVE THE OPTION OF ALREADY. ARE IN THE PROCESS BECAUSE YOUR SCHOOL BY. AND SEVEN OTHER FOCAL AND PRESSURED HAVE YOU DONE THIS. DO YOU DO THAT. THEY SEND YOU A FIRE I MEAN. HELPING OTHER PARENTS THAT WERE TOLD. YOU COULD MAKE THE APPOINTMENT FOR THE SIXTEENTH. SO FOR MODERNIST. WHO HAVE A CHILD SPECIAL NEEDS. VERY FEW MEN ANY COLDER THE MARGIN HOURS. AND THEY DON'T SPEAK ENGLISH DURING COMPUTER SAID THERE NOT LONG INTO SOME MEETINGS- OR MAKING PHONE CALLS. WE THE USER FONG YOUR PHONE I COULD BASIC. HOW COULD YOU ASK THEM TO SIGN UP FOR THEM TO FIGURE OUT. HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO SET UP AN APPOINTMENT NO. THERE ARE NO NO WAY WILL SET UP AND AT THE BEGINNING IT WAS VERY COMPLICATED YOU WANT TO AT LEAST. SEVEN STEPS TO GET TO THE END AND THEN YOU TOLD THAT THERE WAS NO APPOINTMENT. IT IS VERY DIFFICULT AND ONE OF THE MOMS THAT I'M HELPING SHE TOLD ME LIKE THEY TOLD ME. THAT THEY WERE NOT MY BABYSITTERS THAT THEY COULDN'T HELP. THEY KNOW THAT SHE'S NOT COMPUTER LITERATE BUT SHE ONLY SPEAKS SPANISH AND THE SHE STRUGGLING WITH HER TO. HER CHILD. YET WHEN SHE ARMED HERSELF AND GREAT IN THE CULTURE VERY ARE ASKING FOR HELP. THEY'RE BEING TOLD I AM NOT YOUR BABYSITTER. SO THAT HAS TO BE ACCOUNTABILITY ST DEMOCRAT THEY SHOULDN'T SPEAK LIKE THAT WE SHOULDN'T BE DEMEANED. AND IT ALSO GO TO INCOME SUPPORTER SERVICES WHEN THEY TELL US THAT THERE. THAT WE SHOULDN'T BE THE PARENTS PROVIDERS ARE THAT THERE WE ASK FOR SERVICES OR CAP IF YOU WANNA LET OUT OF OUR CHILD THAT'S NOT THE CASE THE CASE IF WE WANT TO BE THE BEST ADVOCATE. AND WE KNOW THAT AS PARENTS WE ARE THE ONE PERSON THAT WILL NOT HURT THE- BILL. THREE LAKE THE IDEA THAT WE'RE BOXING FOR MORE CHILD. IF IT ALREADY TO ASK FOR SERVICES TO BENEFIT OUR FAMILY THAT IS NOT IT OKAY SO MANY UNIQUE. THAT THE BEST PERSON THAT CAN DO IT IS A FAMILY MEMBER BUT EMPOWER THE FAMILY MEMBER TO HAVE THE RESOURCES THEY NEED SO THEY CAN LIVE IN LOS ANGELES SO THEY COULD LIVE IN ORANGE COUNTY BECAUSE THE ONLY THING THAT THEY'RE DOING IS PUSHING US INTO RURAL AREAS BECAUSE FIFTEEN DOLLARS PER HOUR ONE NOT BEING ENOUGH. I KNOW KIDS NEED SO MANY THINGS THAT WE BECOME DESPERATE WE DON'T ST OKAY PEOPLE GO TO SLEEP AT THE SAME TIME. THEY ALWAYS HAVE DIFFERENT BEARS THEY HAVE DIFFERENT STRUGGLE AND THE NEED. FOR THAT KIND OF IT'S A. TWELVE EIGHTEEN TWENTY TWENTY TWO HOURS BILL. CASSIDY WE ARE PROVIDING. THE SERVICES THAT ARE NEEDED FOR CHILD. FOR JILL. BECAUSE THIS ALL THE PARENTS WERE WORKING. AS A KEY. BUT WE'RE BEING SINGLED OUT AS GREEDY SO WE NEED TO HELP PEOPLE TO. TELLING THEM NO WHEN WE ACTUALLY SUBJECT IS VERY DIFFICULT IT REALLY BREAKS DOWN. OUR DIGNITY OR HAVING TO ASK AND ASK AND ASK AND THEN BEING TOLD NO. AND THEN HAVING LAWYERS AND ATTORNEYS AND PEOPLE COME TO US LIKE WE'RE CRIMINALS WE'RE NOT WE ARE AT IT WE ARE TRYING TO GET THE RESEARCH THE SUBJECT NEEDS. WHEN WE'RE NOT HERE.
