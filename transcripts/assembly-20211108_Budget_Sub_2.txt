TODAY'S HEARING THIS MORNING- THIS IS THE ASSEMBLY BUDGET COMMITTEE NUMBER- TWO ON EDUCATION FINANCE THIS IS A SPECIAL INFORMATIONAL HEARING. ON HIGHER EDUCATION AND STUDENT HOUSING AN IMPORTANT TOPIC FOR CALIFORNIA'S WE DEAL WITH OUR HOUSING- CRISIS AFFORDABILITY CRISIS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. AND STUDENT- AFFORDABILITY AS FAR AS THE COST OF COLLEGE AND WE KNOW THAT. THE SKY HIGH RENTS ACROSS THE STATE ARE SQUEEZING A LOT OF PEOPLE ESPECIALLY OUR STUDENTS- A VERY CUTE AS ARE IN THE METROPOLITAN AREAS. WITH WE HAVE- UC AND CSU CAMPUSES WERE AVERAGE TWO BEDROOM APARTMENT RENTS ARE MORE THAN TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH AND IT'S NO WONDER WHY- WE LOOK AT THE COST OF COLLEGE AND HIGHER EDUCATION. ABOUT HALF OF IT IS RELATED TO HOUSING THESE NON TUITION COSTS ARE ARE. OUR KEY TO COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY. AND WE KNOW THIS IS A KEY ISSUE NOT ONLY FOR ONE FOR STUDENTS TO DO WELL WITH THE STUDENTS WHO LIVE NEAR CAMPUS RESEARCH SHOWS ARE MORE LIKELY. TO DO BETTER AND GRADUATE WITHIN FOUR YEARS- WHO WOULD TURN OFF MY- PHONE I HEAR MUSIC FROM THE BACKGROUND NOT SURE WHAT'S GOING ON HERE- AND- IN ADDITION. THAT WE KNOW THAT. MANY OF THE CAMPUSES ARE COVETED AT CAMPUSES THROUGHOUT THE DAY CSU AND UC SYSTEM ESPECIALLY THE UC SYSTEM. ARE FACED WITH COMMUNITY SAYING HEY IF YOU WANT TO GROW WHICH IS A TOP PRIORITY OF US THIS YEAR WE FUNDED A RECORD NUMBER OF SLOTS TO EXPAND- YOU SEE. SOME THESE CAMPUSES THAT COMMUNITIES ARE LITERALLY SUING SAYING HEY IF YOU WANT TO GROW NEED TO BUILD MORE HOUSING SO THESE TWO THINGS. ARE VERY VERY RELATED- IS A PRIORITY OF US LAST YEAR INTRODUCED LEGISLATION TO CREATE A FUND A REVOLVING FUND. WHICH YOU KNOW THE ONLY ELSE TALKS ABOUT WE DID YEARS AGO TO FUND HIGHER EDUCATION THAT MORPHED INTO AN APPROPRIATION THE BUDGET. OF ABOUT TWO BILLION DOLLARS OVER THE NEXT. THREE YEARS- DEFINED HIGHER EDUCATION AND HEALTH HELP CAMPUSES EXPAND. OF HIGHER EDUCATION HOUSING. BECAUSE HOUSING- SO THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT BEST PRACTICES- WHAT THE ISSUES ARE AND WHAT WE CAN DO GOING FORWARD TO HELP. IN THIS FRONT SO WE'LL HAVE. A FEW MEMBERS IN PRESENT IN REMOTELY TODAY- YOU WANT TO SAY THANK FORMER. RACE YOU READY TO GO. OKAY THANK YOU MR AND CHAIR- I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR. THE SPACE HEARING- TO US TODAY. I THINK I'M REALLY. BY THE ILLEGALS. RESEARCHER RECOMMENDATIONS. ON THE REPORT THAT THEY PROVIDED ON THE QUANTITY AND AFFORDABILITY SOON HOUSING CALIFORNIA. I'M VERY PROUD OF. IN SAMBAR DINO IS AS I'VE MENTIONED TO YOU BEFORE SUMMER MEDINA VALLEY COLLEGE. IS LOOKING AT THE VERY SUBJECT OF HOUSING FOR OUR- FOR OUR STUDENTS- WE KNOW THAT THAT THE HOMELESS THE FOSTER FORMER FOSTER YOUTH- THE- NONTRADITIONAL STUDENTS ARE THE ONES WHO SUFFER THE MOST THROUGH. NOT HAVING HOUSING SECURITY SO THIS IS A VERY TIMELY SUBJECT TONIGHT THANK YOU AND THE PANELISTS. FOR THIS INFORMATION. THANK YOU AMERICA JOINED BY OUR HIGHER EDUCATION SHARE MR MEDINA I KNOW. GOES AROUND THE STATE VISITING CHANCELLORS AND COLLEGE PRESIDENTS AND- I'M SURE THEY'RE ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT HOUSING RIGHT MR MEDINA THEY CERTAINLY ARE SO THANK YOU- CHAIR MCCARTY FOR PUTTING THIS TOGETHER THIS PANEL. HEARING TOGETHER. AND YES EVERY TIME I GO. WHETHER IT IS- VISITING WITH THE. COMMUNITY COLLEGE PRESIDENT. OR EIGHT YOU SEE. PRESS OR CSU- HOUSE ALWAYS COMES UP- UC RIVERSIDE WHERE I REPRESENT- ALSO FACES THE SAME CHALLENGES. THAT I THINK- ALL OF THEM ARE- INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER LEARNING THEIR FACES AND THAT IS A SHORTAGE OF HOUSING FOR STUDENTS SO IT LOOK FORWARD TO- LEARNING MORE AND- TAKING ON SOME OF THESE CHALLENGES IN THE NEXT LEGISLATIVE SESSION. YES OKAY SO WITH THAT- DISCONTENT- HOUSEKEEPING I WE HAVE A WITNESSES TESTIFYING TODAY IN PERSON AND USING OUR WEB BACKS SYSTEM WE ALSO WILL HAVE PUBLIC COMMENT AVAILABLE AT THE END OF THE HEARING AS WELL AS HERE IN- THROUGH FORTY TWO A TWO- THAT THE CALL IN NUMBERS ON THE AGENDA BUT IF YOU DON'T HAVE IT'S. ACCESS ONE THREE ONE FIFTY FOUR TO A TWO. ONE THREE ONE FIVE FOUR TWO ZERO ZERO TWO SO WE'LL START OUT BY HEARING FROM OUR L. A. L. WHO DID IT HAS MISSED REYES SAID A NICE- RIGHT HALF OF THE ISSUE AND SOME OPPORTUNITIES FOR CALIFORNIA THEN SOME A SYSTEM WIDE PERSPECTIVES AND LASTLY WE'LL HEAR FROM SOME CAMPUSES WHO ARE FOCUSING THIS ON THE GROUND AND SEE TO SOME CAMPUSES I KNOW THAT HIGHER EDUCATION SHERMAN DEAN AND I HAVE TALKED TO IN PERSON ABOUT THESE ISSUES SO I WITH THAT WE WILL ASK OUR L. A. L. TO COME UP IN. START STOP. GOOD MORNING JENNIFER PATEL LET'S JUST AND ALL OFFICE. AND SO WE WORK- OVER THE PAST SEVERAL WEEKS. I HAD TO GATHER INFORMATION ON THE TOPIC OF STUDENT HOUSING WE SUBMITTED WRITTEN INFORMATION REQUEST TO THE THREE SYSTEM OFFICE SAYS. MATT WITH THOSE OFFICES TO DISCUSS THEIR PROGRAMS. THAT WITH THREE UC CAMPUSES IRVINE MERCED AND SANTA CRUZ. MET WITH FOR CSU CAMPUSES- EAST BAY HUMBOLDT LONG BEACH AND MONTEREY BAY AND WE CONNECTED WITH EXPERTS ON STUDENT HOUSING PROGRAMS AND OTHER STATES. I WANTED TO JUST THINK REALLY QUICKLY ALL OF THOSE WHO WORKED FOR AT WITH US THE SYSTEM OFFICES THE CAMPUSES COMMITTEE STAFF THE ADMINISTRATION THEY ALL GIVE US INFORMATION IN THE PROCESS OF COMPILING A HAND OUT. SO THEY END UP SHARES WHAT WE LEARNED- SIR IS THE HIGHLIGHT SO DIVING RIGHT IN ON THE FIRST PAGE WE FOCUS FIRST ON THE ROLE OF THE STATE AND HOW IT'S HANGED OVER TIME. HIS STAR THE ROLE OF THE STATE HAS BEEN SMALL STUDENT HOUSING PROJECTS HAVE BEEN FUNDED WITH STUDENT CHARGES. THEY HAVEN'T BEEN SUBSIDIZED BY THE STATE. THIS IS STILL THE CASE ACROSS MOST OF THE COUNTRY. WE FOUND FOR STATES THAT EXPLICITLY PROHIBIT STATE FUNDING FROM BEING USED FOR STATE FUNDING. WE DIDN'T FIND ANOTHER STATE THAT SUBSIDIZES STUDENT HOUSING. IN THE LATE EIGHTIES IN CALIFORNIA THE STATE DID PROVIDE A SMALL AMOUNT OF ONE TIME FUNDING TO CREATE A REVOLVING LOAN FUNDS THAT WOULD HELP CSU CAMPUSES. ADD HOUSING- AT LOW BORROWING COSTS. SO THEN JUMPING FORWARD A FEW DECADES THE STATE ROLE VERY RECENTLY HAS EXPANDED SO AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW IS PART OF THE TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY BUDGET ACT THE STATE PROVIDED. ONGOING FUNDING FOR RAPID RE HOUSING PROGRAMS AND THEN AS PART OF THE MOST RECENT BUDGET AGREEMENT THE STATE PROVIDED TWO BILLION FOR STUDENT HOUSING PROJECTS. AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW THAT MONEY IS SPREAD ACROSS THREE YEARS FIVE HUNDRED MILLION IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO AND THEN SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION THE NEXT TWO YEARS. OF THE TOTAL ALLOTMENT THE FUNDS ARE SPREAD ACROSS THE THREE SEGMENTS WITH THEN OF THE COLLEGE ALLOTMENT SPECIFICALLY TWENTY FIVE MILLION AS RESERVE FOR PLANNING GRANTS. COLLEGES TO- GET THESE GRANTS CAN USE IT EITHER TO BUILD NEW HOUSING OR TO CONVERT COMMERCIAL SPACE AND TO HOUSING. THE NEW PROGRAM HAS TWO MAIN GOALS- THE CHAIR ALREADY REFERENCED THIS IN HIS OPENING REMARKS ONE GOAL IS CAPACITY JUST INCREASE THE NUMBER OF BEDS WITH THE PRIMARY GOAL OF HELPING TO ACCOMMODATE FUTURE ENROLLMENT GROWTH. AND THEN THE OTHER GOAL IS TO MAKE THAT HOUSING AFFORDABLE PARTICULARLY FOR LOWER INCOME STUDENTS. ALTHOUGH THE STATE CREATED THIS NEW PROGRAM THERE ARE NO SPECIFIC CAPACITY GOALS THAT THE STATE WANTS TO FUND AN EX NUMBER OF BEDS OR ACTS- SHARE OF THE UNDERGRADUATE POPULATION. STATE LAW DOES HAVE A FEW PROVISIONS RELATING TO HOUSING SO IT ALLOWS CAMPUSES TO OFFER HOUSING IT ALLOWS CAMPUSES TO REQUIRE STUDENTS TO LIVE IN THAT HOUSING. AND OF CAMPUSES DON'T HAVE HOUSING THEN THERE TO GIVE HIGHEST PRIORITY FOR BEDS TO HOMELESS YOUTH AND FOSTER YOUTH. NONE OF THE SEGMENTS THE GOVERNING BOARDS OR THE SYSTEM OFFICES HAVE UNIFORM CAPACITY GOALS THAT APPLY TO ALL CAMPUSES THE CAMPUS IS THAT THEIR OWN CAPACITY GOALS. MANY CAMPUSES ONE HOUSE ALL INTERESTED FIRST YEAR STUDENTS SOME ALSO TRIED TO HOUSE INTERESTED SECOND YEAR STUDENTS. IN ADDITION TO GOALS AROUND UNDERGRADUATE CAPACITY CAMPUSES OFTEN HAVE GOALS TO HOUSE THAT SPECIFIC SHARE OF GRADUATE STUDENTS AND STUDENTS WITH FAMILIES. UNSURPRISINGLY A CAMPUS'S STUDENT BODY HAS A BIG IMPACT ON THE SIZE OF ITS HOUSING PROGRAM SO CAMPUS IS THAT HAVE A HIGH SHARE OF STUDENTS COMMUTING AND LIVING LOCALLY THEY TEND TO HAVE EITHER NO HOUSING PROGRAM OR A SMALL PROGRAM. THOSE CAMPUSES WITH A HIGH SHARE OF NON LOCAL STUDENTS THOSE AT CAMPUSES THAT ARE DRAWING STUDENTS FROM ALL OVER THE STATE WHERE STUDENTS ARE MOVING INTO THE AREA TO ATTEND COLLEGE THEY HAVE MUCH LARGER PROGRAMS. PAGE THREE OF THE HANDOUT SHOWS THE AMOUNT OF CAPACITY ADDED SINCE TWENTY FIFTEEN. BOTH SEGMENTS UC AND CSU HAVE ADDED SUBSTANTIAL HOUSING CENTS TWENTY FIFTEEN CSU REPORTS ADDING A MORE THAN FOURTEEN THOUSAND BEDS THROUGH TWENTY EIGHT PROJECTS YOU SEE- HAS REPORTED ADDING ALMOST TWENTY TWO THOUSAND BEDS AT TWENTY THREE CAMPUS PROJECTS. AND SO IN ADDITION TO THOSE BUT THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN CONSTRUCTED OR LAST FIVE SIX YEARS THEY'RE ALSO BOTH SEGMENTS IN THE PROCESS OF CONSTRUCTING MORE SEE ISSUES IN THE PROCESS OF CONSTRUCTING TWENTY THREE HUNDRED MORE THREE SIX PROJECTS AND YOU SEE IS IN THE PROCESS OF CONSTRUCTING. ABOUT NINETEEN THOUSAND ADDITIONAL BEDS THREE TWENTY ONE PROJECTS. FOR PROVIDE SOME MORE DATA ON THIS SO YOU CAN SEE THAT YOU SEE EVERY CAMPUS HAS ADDED SOME BAD SINCE TWENTY FIFTEEN. SANTA CRUZ HAS ADDED THE FEW ESTIMATE NUMBER OF BEDS BUT I WOULD NOT THERE IN THE MIDST OF A PROJECT THAT PROJECT IS ADDRESSING SOME ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES AT THE MOMENT I THINK YOU MIGHT HEAR MORE ABOUT THAT PROJECT LATER TODAY. AT CSU ABOUT HALF THE CAMPUSES HAVE ADDED BEDS ARE LAST FIVE SIX YEARS SAN DIEGO SAN LUIS OBISPO SAN FRANCISCO HAVE ADDED THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF NEW BALANCE. PAGE FIVE THE FIGURE AT THE TOP SHOWS HOW BEDS HAVE INCREASED IN TANDEM WITH ENROLLMENT GROW SO IT TRIES TO COMPARE WHETHER THE INCREASE AND BEDS HAS KEPT PACE WITH AN ROAMING GROWTH. AND HOUSING CAPACITY HAS SLIGHTLY OUTPACED AT AT EACH SEGMENT. I'M SO WHAT YOU SEE IT'S GONE UP LESS THAN ONE PERCENTAGE POINT- THE BUT IT HAS GONE UP SO THE NUMBER OF BEDS HAVE HAS INCREASED ABOUT 15% OVER THIS PERIOD WHILE ENROLLMENT GROWTH INCREASED FOURTEEN PERCENT. THAT'S THE ISSUE THE- INCREASES A BIT MORE NOTABLE ITS NUMBER THE IT SHARE OF BAD HAVE INCREASED EIGHTEEN PERCENT. WELL IT SAN ROMAN INCREASED TWO POINT 3% SO THAT PROBABLY SOUNDS LOW TO YOU BECAUSE CSU'S UNDERGRADUATE RESIDENT ENROLLMENT HAS GONE UP MUCH MORE THAN TWO POINT 3% BUT IT'S BEEN OFFSET BY REDUCTIONS IN GRADUATE ENROLLMENT AND NONRESIDENT ENROLLMENT. TURNING TO THE COLLEGES FOR A MOMENT PRIOR TO TWENTY NINETEEN THERE WERE ELEVEN COMMUNITY COLLEGES THAT HAD HOUSING PROGRAMS ALMOST ALL OF THESE WERE IN RURAL AREAS. AND ALMOST ALL OF THEM ARE LONG STANDING. IN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY ORANGE COAST COLLEGE OPENED A STUDENT HOUSING FACILITY AND IT'S THE LARGEST FACILITY AMONGST THE COLLEGES RIGHT NOW EIGHT HUNDRED BAGS THAT'S FOUR TIMES LARGER THAN ANY OTHER COMMUNITY COLLEGE HOUSING PROGRAM- AS ITS ACCOUNTING FOR ABOUT ONE THIRD OF ALL COMMUNITY COLLEGE BEDS RIGHT NOW. SO I'M. WE ALSO LOOKED AT HOW DOES THE CAMPUS FIGURE OUT WHETHER THERE IS A ON DEMAND STUDENT DEMAND. AND WE FOUND THAT CAMPUS IS THEY USE A SIMILAR PRODUCT PROCESS SO EVERY YEAR THEY'RE LOOKING AT THEIR ON CAMPUS OCCUPANCY RATES. AT WAIT LISTS FOR THEIR ON CAMPUS HOUSING AND NOT VACANCY RATES WITHIN THE COMMUNITY. AND IF THEIR WEIGHT UNSURPRISINGLY IF THEIR WAIT LISTS ARE LONG THERE VACANCY RATES IN THE AREA ARE VERY LOW AND THEIR HEART CAMPUS HOUSING GOALS AREN'T BEING MET. THEN THEY INITIATE A MORE INTENSIVE STUDENT HOUSING STUDY TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHERE IS THE UNMET DEMANDS HOW DO THEY BUILD ACCORDINGLY. SO THE SURVEY STUDENTS TYPICALLY AND UNDERTAKE A MUCH FULLER ANALYSIS OF THE LOCAL HOUSING MARKET. I KNOW THAT THERE ARE A FEW UC CAMPUSES THAT HAVE AMMO USE WITH THEIR COMMUNITIES SUCH THAT IF THEY INCREASE ENROLLMENT GROWTH THEY ARE REQUIRED TO INCREASE THEIR BADS. UC DAVIS AND UC SANTA CRUZ FALL IN THIS CATEGORY YOU MIGHT ALSO HEAR MORE ABOUT THAT LATER TODAY. WE LOOK WAIT LESS- BUT THE FALL TWENTY TWENTY AND FALL TWENTY TWENTY ONE BECAUSE OF CODE MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST DATA FOR YOU IT MIGHT BE SLIGHTLY ANOMALOUS. BUT NONE THE LESS THAT DATE AS REPORTED HERE FOR TALK FALL TWENTY TWENTY ONE. CSU HAD WAIT LISTS AT THIRTEEN CAMPUS AS TOTALING ABOUT EIGHTY SEVEN HUNDRED STUDENTS. AND THAT YOU SEE EIGHT CAMPUSES HAD WAIT LISTS TOTALING SLIGHTLY MORE THAN SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED STUDENTS. THE TO UC CAMPUSES THAT DIDN'T HAVE WAIT LISTS FOR UC SAN FRANCISCO IT ACTUALLY REPORTED A 20% VACANCY RATE RIGHT BEFORE THE PANDEMIC IT BROUGHT A HOUSING STRUCTURE ONLINE. AND IN SAN FRANCISCO STILL DEALING WITH SOME LINGERING EFFECTS OF THE DESTRUCTION OF COALBED. I'M AND THEN SANTA CRUZ REPORTED THAT ALTHOUGH IT MAINTAINS WEIGHTLESS TYPICALLY BY THE TIME THING SHUFFLE OUT IT ENDS UP WITH A SMALL NUMBER OF VACANCIES AND AT ON CAMPUS HOUSING PROGRAM. SO IN ADDITION TO THE BEDS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN BILL AND THAT ARE IN THE MIDST OF CONSTRUCTION AS WE SPEAK BOTH SEGMENTS HAVE PLANS TO BUILD MORE. CSU WHEN YOU LOOK AT THEIR OUT YOUR PLANS THEY HAVE SEVENTEEN HOUSING PROJECTS NOW UNDER DEVELOPMENT AT ELEVEN CAMPUSES WHAT AT ABOUT ELEVEN THOUSAND ADDS. AND THEN YOU SEE HAS ELEVEN. HOUSING PROJECTS UNDER DEVELOPMENT SIX CAMPUSES ADDING MORE THAN SIXTEEN THOUSAND BEDS. SO SHIFTING FOR JUST A MOMENT FROM CAPACITY TO AFFORDABILITY. CAMPUS IS AS YOU KNOW THEY SACKED THEIR STUDENT HOUSING CHARGES EVERY YEAR AND THEY HAVE TWO MAIN GOALS OF TRYING TO COVER THAT PROGRAMS OPERATING COSTS AND ANNUAL DEBT SERVICE COSTS WHILE AT THE SAME TIME HAVING A CHARGE THAT STUDENTS CAN AFFORD- IDEALLY THAT'S BELOW WHAT THE MARKET IS CHARGING IN THEIR AREA. LIVING ARRANGEMENTS WILL AFFECT THAT CHARGE SO CAMPUS IS TYPICALLY HAVE A RIGHTY OF TYPES OF HOUSING OPTIONS FROM SINGLE TO DOUBLE TO TRIPLE ROOMS TO THAT SHARE A COMMUNAL BATHROOM ON ONE FLOOR. TWO APARTMENTS AND QUADS INN SUITES WHERE THEY MIGHT SHARE A KITCHEN AND A BATHROOM WITH JUST A FEW ROOMS AND THE PRICES FOR ALL OF THOSE TWO VERY. AT CSU THE ON CAMPUS HOUSING CHARGE WE JUST LOOK FOR A DOUBLE ROOM JUST TO GIVE YOU SOME SENSE OF THE VARIATION AMONGST CAMPUSES. AND THE CHARGE RANGES FROM MORE THAN ELEVEN THOUSAND AT FULLER TEN AND CHANNEL ISLANDS TO LESS THAN SIX THOUSAND PER ACADEMIC YEAR AT CSU MONTEREY I'M SORRY MARITIME AND FRESNO. THAT DATA IS ALSO PROVIDED IN MORE DETAIL ON THE NEXT PAGE. YOU SEE SENSE THAT IT DOESN'T SYSTEMATICALLY COLLECT DATA ON ITS ON CAMPUS CHARGES AT ALL CAMPUSES RELATIVE TO THE LOCAL MARKETS BUT THAT- IT DOES IT INTENDS TO HAVE ITS ON CAMPUS CHARGES BELOW MARKET RATE. SO AS I MENTIONED ON PAGE EIGHT YOU CAN SEE THE DATA FOR CSU FOR THE SAKE OF TIME I'M JUST GONNA LEAVE THAT FOR YOUR REFERENCE. PAGE NINE FOCUSES ON A KEY- ASPECT WE WERE ASKED TO- AT INVESTING- LEARN MORE ABOUT WHICH IS HOW CAMPUSES FINANCE THEIR FACILITY PROJECTS. FOR SOME PROJECTS UNIVERSITY SELL BONDS AND THEY REPAY THE DEBT ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE BONDS FROM THE ANNUAL STUDENT HOUSING CHARGES TYPICALLY REPAYMENT OCCURS OVER ROUGHLY THIRTY YEARS. CAMPUSES LIKE LIKE MANY OF YOU WITH MAYBE A HOME MORTGAGE THEY DO PUT A LITTLE BIT DOWN TYPICALLY SOMETHING LIKE FIVE OR 20% THEY PAYING CASH UP FRONT THIS TENDS TO HELP THEM GET MORE FAVORABLE BARLEY IN TERMS. SOME PROJECTS USE UP PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP WHICH ARE THESE LOCALLY NEGOTIATED AGREEMENTS BETWEEN A PRIVATE PARTNER TO AND A DEVELOPER AND THEN THE CAMPUS. IN THE SAME WAY THAT A REVENUE BOND IS RETIRED THOUGH A P. THREE THAT WILL ALSO BE RETIRED USING ANNUAL STUDENT HOUSING CHARGES TO COVER THE DEBT SERVICE PAYMENT OVER THE AMORTIZATION PERIOD. IN MANY CASES WITH THE P. THREE THE P. THREE ISN'T THE PARTNER IS NOT ONLY HELPING WITH CONSTRUCTION BUT THEY'RE ALSO MAINTAINING AND OPERATING THE FACILITY FOR A SET PERIOD OF TIME AND THEN AFTER THAT TIME LAPSES SAY THIRTY YEARS FULL CONTROL OF THE FACILITY- GOES TO THE CAMPUS. AND THE THIRD MAIN WAY THAT- SOME PROJECTS AND AS A MUCH LESS COMMON WAY IS THROUGH DONOR SUPPORT. SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE COLLEGES TWO THIRDS OF THEIR PROJECTS HAVE BEEN FINANCED WITH LOCAL BONDS AND THEN ROUGHLY A THIRD THROUGH A P. THREE ARRANGEMENT. WHEN YOU LOOK AT CSU CAMPUSES MOST OF THEIR PROJECTS ARE DONE WITH REVENUE BONDS. AND THEN YOU SEE HAS USED A MIX OF BONDS P. THREE IS AND ON OUR SUPPORT- OVER OVER THE COURSE OF TIME P. THREES HAVE BEEN MORE PREVALENT THAT YOU SEE THAT OTHERS. SO THERE ARE MANY FACTORS THAT WILL AFFECT WHAT KIND OF FINANCING APPROACH A PROJECT TAKES. SO THOSE CAMPUSES THAT HAVE LARGE AND OR LONG STANDING HOUSING PROGRAMS RELATIVELY LOW LEVELS OF THAT EXISTING HOUSING FACILITIES THAT ARE IN GOOD CONDITION. UNSURPRISINGLY THESE OTHER ONES THAT HAVE MORE BUDGET CAPACITY THEY CAN STILL CHARGE ANNUAL HOUSING CHARGES AND THEN THEY CAN BUILD UP THEIR RESERVES AND WHEN THEY GO TO THE MARKET THEY'LL HAVE MORE TO MAKE IS THE DOWN PAYMENT BILL TYPICALLY GET BETTER BORROWING TERMS. NEWER CAMPUSES CAMPUSES WITH SMALLER HOUSING PROGRAMS WITH HIGH LEVELS OF ASSOCIATED THAT WITH AN OLDER HOUSING STOCK THAT NEEDS SUBSTANTIAL RENOVATION. THEY'RE NOT GONNA HAVE THE SAME LEVEL OF RESERVES TYPICALLY SO WHEN THEY GO OUT TO THE MARKET THEIR BAR IN TERMS WILL TYPICALLY BE SOMEWHAT LESS ADVANTAGEOUS. SO AGAIN BOTH SETS OF GROUPS ARE ABLE TO ACCESS THE MARKET JUST TENDS TO BE NOT AS FAVORABLE FOR SOME CAMPUSES RELATIVE TO OTHERS. SO THEN ON PAGE ELEVEN ANOTHER TOPIC WE WERE ASKED TO LOOK INTO IS WHAT ARE THE CONSTRAINTS WHY IS IT THAT SOME CAMPUSES- ARE HAVING DIFFICULTY ADDING CAPACITY AT AN AFFORDABLE RATE. AND ONE THAT OBVIOUSLY CAME UP AGAIN AND AGAIN WAS FINANCING. BUT IT WASN'T FINANCING IN THE SENSE OF HITTING A DEBT LIMIT OR DEBT CAPACITY BOTH OF THE SYSTEMS REPORTED THAT THEY HAVE BILLIONS OF ROOM LEFT UNDER WHAT MIGHT BE A LIKE A THEORETICAL OR EVEN PRACTICAL THAT STEALING LIKE THEY CAN'T GO TO THE MARKET AND ACCESS ADDITIONAL BORROWING. AND THEY REPORTED THAT DEBT LIMITS WEREN'T THE THING THAT WAS PREVENTING ANY PARTICULAR CAMPUS FROM PURSUING A PROJECT. BUT WHAT ALMOST EVERY PROJECT VOICE TO US IS THAT IT'S JUST HARD TO MAKE PROJECTS VIABLE SO WHAT THEY HAVE TO DO IS MAKE SURE THAT THEY BUILD THE FACILITY AT SUCH A WAY THAT THEY CAN COVER THE ANNUAL OPERATING COSTS THE ANNUAL DEBT SERVICE COSTS AND STILL HAVE A RATE CHARGING STUDENTS THAT THEY THINK IS AFFORDABLE THAT STUDENTS WOULD STILL BE WILLING TO PAY. SO THAT'S A CHALLENGE FOR ALL PROJECT ALMOST ALL PROJECTS. WHAT SOME CAMPUS ARE ABLE TO DO PARTICULARLY THOSE THAT HAVE LOTS OF HOUSING FACILITIES IS THEY CAN TAKE THE OLDER FACILITIES THAT MIGHT HAVE RETIRED THEIR DEBT SERVICE BUT THEY'RE STILL HAVING REVENUE FROM STUDENT CHARGES SO THEY HAVE RESERVES. THEY CAN USE THAT TO CROSS SUBSIDIZE THE NEWER HOUSING FACILITIES FOR THE FIRST FEW YEARS TO MAKE THOSE RATS MORE MANAGEABLE FOR STUDENTS. ANOTHER MAJOR CONSTRAINT THAT WE HEARD FROM ALMOST EVERY CAMPUS. DEALT WITH ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES SO CAMPUS SAYS FOR ANY LARGE PROJECT HAVE TO FOLLOW THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT SO THE SEQUEL REVIEW PROCESS SEES. AND CAMPUS IS COMMONLY REPORT THAT THOSE PROCESS FEES AND POTENTIAL LITIGATION ASSOCIATED WITH THEM CAN INCREASE THEIR COST AND LENGTH AND THEIR PROJECT TIME. NOW HAVING SAID THAT AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW CONCERNS MISTY QUAD TRACED BACK DECADES AND THE STATE PERIODICALLY HAS DONE THESE INTENSIVE REFUSE TO TRY TO STREAMLINE THE PROCESS AND TRY TO BALANCE ALL OF THE ISSUES AT STAKE. SO FOR THE SAKE OF THIS- HERE IN THIS PARTICULAR TIME FRAME WE DIDN'T DO A DEEP DIVE ON THE NEW OPPORTUNITIES THE STATE MIGHT HAVE TO DO FURTHER STREAMLINING IT COULD BE AN AVENUE YOU WANT TO INVESTIGATE MOVING FORWARD BUT AGAIN THAT HAS BEEN DONE PERIODICALLY BY THE STATE TO TRY TO IMPROVE AND STREAMLINE THAT PROCESS. WHERE WE HEARD FINANCING AN ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS FROM ALMOST EVERY PROJECT IN CAMPUS WE TALKED TO A FEW OF THEM SAID THEY HAD THE ADDED CHALLENGE OF LAND ACQUISITION. SO WE TENDED TO HEAR THAT'S UNSURPRISINGLY FROM CAMPUSES THAT ARE FEEL FULLY BUILT OUT AND OR THEY FACE GEOGRAPHIC CONSTRAINTS FROM BUILDING OUT THEY THEY- BUMP UP AGAINST AN OCEAN OR A FOREST OR MOUNTAIN OR CITY DEVELOPMENT THAT WOULD OBVIOUSLY MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO BUILD. THIS CAMPUS IS STILL PURSUE HOUSING PROJECTS BUT THEY TEND TO HAVE TO DEMOLISH AND BUILD UP OR RENOVATE AND BUILD UP SO THAT THEY CAN NOT THE CAPACITY. SO BECAUSE WE THOUGHT THERE WOULD BE INTEREST IN THIS NEW PROGRAM THAT THE STATE RECENTLY CREATED ON PAGE TWELVE WE DO PROVIDE SOME VERY PRELIMINARY INFORMATION ABOUT THAT PROGRAM. SO APPLICATIONS WERE DUE UNDER STATE LAW THEY WERE DUE TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE OCTOBER THIRTY FIRST SO JUST ABOUT A WEEK AGO. AND THE ADMINISTRATION- VERY JUST ARE GENEROUSLY IN QUICKLY SHARED SOME OF THAT INFORMATION WITH US. FINANCED RECEIVED A HUNDRED AND THIRTEEN APPLICATIONS TOTALING THREE POINT THREE BILLION. SO AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THE CHART EACH STATEMENT REQUESTED MORE THAN THEIR TOTAL PROGRAM ALLOTMENTS NOT JUST THEIR ALLOTMENT FOR TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUT ACTUALLY THEIR TOTAL ALLOTMENT ACROSS THE THREE YEARS. SO THERE WAS LOTS OF INTEREST IN THIS PROGRAM LOTS OF APPLICATIONS SUBMITTED. FOR THE LAST TWO PAGES OF- I'M SORRY- WHAT WE ALSO TRIED TO DO JUST A FEW WOULD FIND IT INTERESTING US TO TAKE SOME OF THAT PRELIMINARY INFORMATION AND GET A BETTER SENSE OF HOW FAR THE STATE DOLLARS WOULD STRETCH. SO BASED UPON JUST A SAMPLE OF THOSE APPLICATIONS THAT WE WERE ABLE TO PEEK AT- THE COST PER BED COULD RANGE FROM ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND TO MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND. SO WITHIN THAT RANGE- THIS THE PROGRAM THIS NEW CASH PROGRAM THE STATE CREATED COULD FIND BETWEEN SEVEN THOUSAND AND TWELVE THOUSAND ADDITIONAL PADS. SO THAT WOULD INCREASE TOTAL HOUSING CAPACITY ACROSS THE THREE SEGMENTS BY 427% DEPENDING ON WHERE THE EXACT COST PER BAD LANDED. HAVING SAID THAT YOU'RE GONNA SEE VERY DIFFERENT EFFECTS ACROSS THE THREE SEGMENTS BECAUSE OF THE WAY THE PROGRAM ALLOTMENTS WORK WITH 50% RESERVE FOR THE COLLEGES TWENTY FOR IT THE UNIVERSITIES. SO YOU MIGHT SEE HOUSING CAPACITY DOUBLE AT THE COLLEGES. MAYBE INCREASE SOMEWHERE LIKE 325% AT CSU AND THEN ONE OR 2% THAT YOU SEE. THOSE APPLICATIONS AGAIN WILL COME YOUR WAY AND MARCH THE ADMINISTRATION WILL GO THROUGH THOSE APPLICATIONS AND THEN GIVE YOU A FIRST STEP TO REVEAL COME MARCH. THE LAST TWO PAGES NOW THEY HAVE NOT JUST FOCUSED ON THE TAKE AWAY SO WE DID THIS ENDEAVOR AND TALKING WITH THESE VARIOUS GROUPS ON WHAT WE WALKED AWAY- WITH IS THAT. THERE IS A SENSE THAT CAMPUSES HAVE BEEN AND ARE ADDING CAPACITY SO EVEN WITHOUT STATE FUNDS THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO NAVIGATE THESE CHALLENGES- THEY'VE THEY'VE ADDED BEDS THERE NOW IN THE MIDST OF CONSTRUCT IN THEM AND THEY HAVE PLANS FOR MORE. CAMPUSES ARE ALSO SOMEWHAT UNIQUE AS THE LANDLORD BECAUSE THEY CAN'T REQUIRE STUDENTS TO LIVE ON CAMPUS AND AS A RESULT OF THAT THEIR PROJECT RISK IS SOMEWHAT LOWER BECAUSE THEY HAVE SOMEWHAT GREATER PREDICTABILITY. AND WHAT THEIR FUTURE REVENUE STREAMS WILL BE BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT THEY CAN REQUIRE AGAIN STUDENTS TO SHOW UP AND PAY. I WE KNOW THAT AT LEAST AT THIS TIME OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST FEW YEARS INTEREST RATES HAVE BEEN AT HISTORICAL LOWS. INTEREST RATES ARE A BIG FACTOR IN WHETHER A CAMPUS WANTS TO PURSUE A HOUSING PROJECT SO IT'S BEEN VIEWED AS A PARTICULARLY ATTRACTIVE TIME TO BUILD. NO INTEREST RATES MIGHT START GOING UP OVER THE NEXT COMING QUARTERS AND YEARS- IF THEY GO UP A LITTLE BIT I THINK CAMPUSES MIGHT STILL VIEW IT AS FAVORABLE IF THEY GO UP STEEPLY OBVIOUSLY DIDN'T STAND DYNAMICS ARE GOING TO CHANGE. OUT WHAT IT TAKES TO MAKE A PROJECT FISCALLY VIABLE IS GOING TO BE MUCH MORE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED. WE ALSO WALKED AWAY RECOGNIZING THAT CAMPUS CHALLENGES TEND TO BE A LOCALIZED. SO ALL OF THESE FACTORS I MENTIONED THIS MORNING I CAMPUSES FISCAL CONDITION IT'S EXISTING HOUSING STOCK THE STATE OF THAT STOCK. THE CURRENT LOCAL HOUSING MARKET CONSTRUCTION COSTS IN THAT AREA THE SPECIFIC ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES THAT A CAMPUS IS DEALING WITH. THE COMMUNITY CONCERNS THIS DIFFER ACROSS ACROSS CAMPUS AS- SUCH THAT IF THE ANY STATE POLICY RESPONSE LIKELY WOULD WANT TO TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT AND OFFER SOME FLEXIBILITY FOR CAMPUSES TO DEAL WITH THOSE PARTICULAR CHALLENGES THEY'RE FACING. WE ALSO RECORD A WALKED AWAY- WITH THIS RECOGNITION THAT THERE ARE MULTIPLE WAYS THE STATE HAS FOR ADDRESSING AFFORDABILITY AND HOMELESSNESS. ONE MAJOR WAY THE STATE HAS TRIED TO DO THIS IS STARKLY IS AND IN TERMS OF HELPING STUDENTS WITH THEIR LIVING COSTS IS THROUGH FINANCIAL AID PROGRAMS. AND OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS THE LEGISLATURE HAS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED THE AMOUNT OF FINANCIAL AID FOR LIVING COSTS AS PROVIDED MORE AID FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS WHO ARE GOING FULL TIME FOR STUDENTS WITH DEPENDENT CHILDREN FOR FOSTER YOUTH. AS PART OF THE MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP TWO POINT OH IT SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED LIVING AID FOR UC AND CSU STUDENTS. AND THEN IN ADDITION TO THESE TRADITIONAL FINANCIAL AID PROGRAMS THE STATE HAS CREATED THESE RAPID RE HOUSING PROGRAMS. AND WHAT MIGHT BE GOOD NEWS FOR YOU IS CAMPUSES REPORT THAT THOSE RAPID RE HOUSING PROGRAMS ARE WORKING SO THEY'RE SETTING ASIDE SLOTS WHEN A STUDENT INDICATES THAT THEIR HOUSING SITUATION IS VULNERABLE WHERE THEY CAN PUT THEM IN A RESIDENTIAL HALL AND GIVE THEM STABLE HOUSING. FOR SOME COURSE OF TIME BEFORE THEY CAN MOVE THEM AND EITHER TO ANOTHER HOUSING DEVELOPMENT THAT'S STABLE ARE JUST STAYING RIGHT THERE IN. A RESIDENTIAL. SO WE WALKED AWAY NOT REALLY HAVING A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THE NEW HOUSING GRANTS WOULD INTERACT WITH THESE TRADITIONAL FINANCIAL AID PROGRAMS AS WELL AS THE RAPID RE HOUSING PROGRAMS. AND I THINK IT'S STILL OPEN ISSUE WHETHER THOSE HOUSING GRANTS WILL BE MORE OR LESS EFFECTIVE- AT HELPING STUDENTS THAN THESE OTHER PROGRAMS NOW A BIG CAVIAR IS THOSE OTHER PROGRAMS LIKE YOUR FINANCIAL AID IN RAPID REHOUSING PROGRAMS. THEIR ONGOING AND THIS IS A ONE TIME THEN THE HOUSING PROGRAM AS ONE TIME SO THAT'S A BIG CONSIDERATION FOR YOU. THE FOURTH AND FINAL TAKE AWAY IS THAT THE STATE IS FACING SIGNIFICANT FISCAL TRADE OFFS SO IF THE STATE WANTS YOU SEE AND SEE IF YOU FOR EXAMPLE TO ADD STUDENTS. FOR SOME CAMPUSES THAT WILL MEAN NOT ONLY KNEW HOUSING SPACE BUT NEW ACADEMIC SPACE. AND CAMPUSES RELY VERY HEAVILY ON THE STATE FOR THEIR ACADEMIC SPACE. THE STATE OBVIOUSLY STILL WANTS CAMPUSES TO SERVE OTHER EXISTING STUDENTS AND SAFE- WELL MAINTAINED FACILITIES AND ALL THE SEGMENTS ARE REPORTING BACKLOG OF DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. SO BIG FISCAL TRADE OFFS FOR YOU BETWEEN DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. NEW ACADEMIC SPACE AND NO HOUSING SPACE. BY CONCLUDES THE OVERVIEW I'M HAPPY TO AND TRY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. OKAY QUESTIONS FOR THE L. A. L. MISTER O'DONNELL AND BY THE WAY WELCOME MR DONALD AND MR LEE THANK YOU GOOD MORNING. THANK YOU. I THANK YOU CHAIR I JUST A QUICK QUESTION WITH REGARD TO YOU ARE YOU TALK ABOUT OTHER BRANDS YOU KNOW WHEN EVERYONE PART OF THE COST OF THE TO LIVE THERE. ARE THE NUMBER OF UNITS AT A CONSTRUCTION BUT THERE WASN'T TOO MUCH THERE WAS TOO MUCH IN DEPTH ON HOW MUCH IT COST TO CONSTRUCT EACH UNITS. OF NEW HOUSING LEAVE TALK I THINK YOU SAID BETWEEN. ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND TO THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND. IS IT IS IT. IS THAT THAT THAT'S QUITE A RANGE. RIGHT IS ARE THERE ANY FACTORS BUILT INTO THAT RANGE THAT YOU'RE AWARE OF AS FAR AS JUST JUST. JUST JUST TO SEE CSU OR UC DO A BETTER JOB. AT CONSTRUCTING HOUSING IN A MORE EFFICIENT MANNER COST. COST FRIENDLY MANNER ACCEPT OR DO YOU HAVE ANY. CAN YOU ADD ANYTHING TO THAT CONVERSATION. YEAH IF IT'S HELPFUL WE LOOKED AT THE CSU IN THE- FIRST ROUND OF APPLICATIONS SUBMITTED EIGHT APPLICATIONS. AND THEIR COST PER PROJECT PER BAD. RANGE FROM TWO HUNDRED AND TWO THOUSAND TWO I THINK THREE HUNDRED AND FOUR THOUSAND SO IF A NOTABLE RANGE THEIR AVERAGE WAS TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND. WHEN WE LOOK OVER PROJECTS WE HAVE LIMITED DATA ON THE OTHER SIX MONTHS AND SOME OTHER HOUSING PROJECTS OVER TIME- AND- IT IS ALSO HOUSING CUT CONSTRUCTION COSTS ARE GOING UP SO EVEN WHEN WE LOOK AT IT YOU SEE HOUSING PROJECT FROM FOUR YEARS AGO WE KNOW IT'S NOT A GREAT. INDICATOR WHAT THEY PAY IF THEY WANT TO THE MARKET TODAY. BUT THOSE TEND TO BE IN THE HIGH ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED THOUSANDS. SO THIS IS A BIT OF GAS WORK WE REALLY WERE JUST TRYING TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF ROUGHLY HOW MUCH YOUR CAPACITY WOULD ADD. I THINK I APPRECIATE THE SPIRIT OF THE QUESTION AT THE FISCAL ANALYSTS ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. HOW MUCH SHOULD A BAD COST AND WHAT FACTORS SHOULD YOU BE CONSIDERING AND TRYING TO CONTROL THE COST. AND AS YOU WORK WITH FINANCE OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS ARE THESE APPLICATIONS YOU'VE GOT TOO HIGH OF A COST COULD MAYBE RE ENGINEERING THE BUILDING TO GIVE YOU MORE BEDS BUT STILL. A GOOD FACILITY WHERE STUDENTS ARE STATE FAN THEY HAVE GOOD COMMUNAL. SPACE- BUT WE HAVEN'T I. DON'T REALLY. INTO HOW TO FIGURE. WHETHER THE RATE ARE ARE BALLPARK REASONABLE WHEN YOU LOOK AT HISTORY THERE BALLPARK REASONABLE. OKAY IT WOULD JUST ONE MORE QUESTION SO AND SO I THAT AND ALSO WE DON'T HAVE ANY DATA RELATIVE TO. WHETHER OR NOT- HOW MANY BENEFACTORS ARE GIVING. TO BUILD. TO AYE ANYONE OF THE SYSTEMS TO BUILD STUDENT HOUSING AND I YOU KNOW THERE'S A CIRCUS AND IN SANTA BARBARA RIGHT NOW RIGHT. SO I MEAN IS THAT HAPPENING ALL OVER THE UC SYSTEM CSU SYSTEM AS A ONE SEGMENT GETS MORE MONEY. FROM BENEFACTOR ENSURE THAT PLAN HOW MUCH WE SUPPORT EACH SYSTEM AS WELL ANY OPINIONS YEAH- AS WE LOOKED AT HOW THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND CSU PROJECTS WERE FUNDED SINCE TWENTY SIXTEEN. I DON'T THINK WE CAME ACROSS A SINGLE PROJECT A STUDENT HOUSING PROJECT THAT WAS FINANCED IN ANY NOTABLE WAY FROM PHILANTHROPIC SUPPORT I DON'T KNOW IF THEY GOT MUCH IN THE PHILANTHROPIC SUPPORT. YOU HEAR ABOUT IT AT UC CAMPUSES OBVIOUSLY THERE'S BEEN A BIG ONE ON THE NEWS OF LATE REGARDING THE UC SANTA BARBARA PROJECT BUT EVEN NOT YOU SEE IT'S NOT HOW- IN. ANY NOTABLE SHARE OF THEIR FACILITIES ARE FINANCE P. THREES- FOR EXAMPLE OVER THE LAST FIVE SIX YEARS WERE ACCOUNTING FOR ABOUT 40% ANOTHER HUGE CHUNK OR ACCOUNTED THROUGH REVENUE BONDS. SO YOU CAN ASK OUR OBVIOUSLY YOUR SEATS TO GIVE YOU MORE ACCURATE INFORMATION THIS AFTERNOON BUT I HAVE A SENSE IT'S- LIKE LESS THAN 10% OF THEIR HOUSING FACILITIES ARE FUNDED THROUGH PHILANTHROPIC SUPPORT THAT MIGHT EVEN BE. TOO HIGH BUT BUT I APPRECIATE THAT THE GAS AND. YOU SEE IS IN THE ROOM SO THEY CAN CLARIFY. OKAY THANK YOU. THE ONLY REASON I IS THAT COULD. IF THE BENEFACTORS DESIGNING THE BUILDING. THAT COULD IMPACT THE ULTIMATE COST OF THE BUILDING. AND THEN YOU HAVE TO QUESTION WHETHER IT'S WORTH HAVING THAT BENEFACTOR EVEN IN THE END MAYBE YEAH ONE OF THE MORE STRAIGHTFORWARD WAYS IN THIS I THINK IS A FUNDAMENTAL TENSION BEFORE YOU IS YOU CAN START GETTING GREATER ASSUREDLY ON THE COST PER BED BY PRESCRIBING SOME OF THE ARCHITECTURAL DETAILS OF THE BUILDING HOW MANY STUDENTS YOU WANT IN A ROOM. HOW MANY BATHROOMS YOU WANT PER STUDENT ACCESS TO KITCHENS EXIDE ROCK THAT WILL ALL AFFECT HOW MANY WINDOWS YOU WANT PER PROBE AS ROOM ARE COMMON STUDY SPACE AREAS HOW MUCH YOU WANT FOR IN ROOM SOURCES COMMON STUDY SPACE BUT THESE ARE THINGS THE STATE TRADITIONALLY HAS NOT WEIGHED IN ON- AND SO THE BIG TENSION IS DO YOU WANT TO BE PRESCRIPTIVE SO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GETTING SPECIFICALLY WITH THE DOLLARS. OR DO YOU WANT TO JUST GIVE THE CAMPUSES MONEY MAYBE HAVE A REPORT ON THE BACKEND IN TERMS OF HOW MANY BEDS WERE ADDED THE PRICE PER BED WHAT THE RESULTING MONTHLY RENTS WILL BE AND GET US FUNDS ON THAT WHOLE HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE ON THAT BACK AND IT IS THAT. IT'S A DIFFICULT CHOICE FOR YOU TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO HOW TO. ADMINISTER THIS PROGRAM MOVING FORWARD. GREAT THANK AYE MINISTER PROBABLY LONGER DESIGN AT DESIGN. I AM NOT INTERESTED IN DESIGNING COLLEGE DORMS MYSELF SO. I CAN SPEAK FOR MY FELLOW LEGISLATORS THANK YOU. WELL THANK YOU WELL IF YOU HAVE TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS APPARENTLY YOU CAN DESIGN YOUR OWN DORM RIGHT MR DONE. AND YOU KNOW I WAS GONNA ASK THAT WE'RE NOT THERE YET BUT MR POSTER MIGHT I DID HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT AND I DON'T WANNA GET INTO HEARING ABOUT SANTA BARBARA BUT JUST. GUESTS GET READY FOR THAT BUT I GUESS THE BIG PICTURE THERE IS IT'S A ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLAR PROJECT. AND THIS. BENEFACTOR IS GONNA DONATE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED MILLION PUTS A LOT OF MONEY. THAT'S ALL OF HIS BILL THE WHOLE THING IT'S LIKE 1015% OF ITSELF. IS I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS IF IT DOES. YOU KNOW DOES THAT MAKE IT A MAKE OR BREAK I DON'T KNOW I'M I'M NOT THINK THAT'S QUITE ACCURATE SO BUT WE CAN GET. INTO THAT BUT THE DUTY TO KIND OF OVERARCHING QUESTIONS FOR. THE L. A. L. IS WHAT TO DO WITH- THE MONEY. WE HAVE. SET ASIDE. IN THE BUDGET. AND MONEY RECOUP THE MONEY WE'RE GONNA GET NEXT YEAR WOULD HAVE MORE ONE TIME MONEY THIS IS A TOP PRIORITY IN. COLLEGE HOUSING SO- THE WILL COME OF THAT BACK THAT THE SECOND BUT- THE FIRST PICTURE THE FIRST THING IS. AS YOU KNOW IT IT IT'S VERY DIVERSE YOU KNOW SOME SEE ISSUES AND FRESNO AND BAKERSFIELD AND CSU SAMBAR TO DINO AND- MAYBE THEY DON'T HAVE THE- HUGE NEED. FOR STUDENT HOUSING IT'S A COMMUTER CAMPUS OR THERE IS. A LOT OF HOUSING NEXT TO THE CAMPUS AS WELL. AND THEN IT YOU THAT YOU SEE IS. THAT IT'S MORE NEED FOR STUDENT HOUSING- BUT SOME IT SOUNDS VERY DIFFERENT WHERE AS YOU KNOW THAT UC. BERKELEY AND SANTA BARBARA AND SANTA CRZ LA DOES NOT LAND BUT IT DAVIS AND- RIVERSIDE MERCED. THERE'S A LOT OF LAND SO IT'S NOT ALWAYS. APPLES AND ORANGES. BUT I'M KIND OF. PERPLEXED BECAUSE- WHEN I'VE GONE TO TALK TO. CHANCELLORS AND PRESIDENTS AS HAS. CHAIR MEDINA A LOT OF THEM HAVE SAID- THE SAME THING WHICH IS THEY WANT TO BUILD MORE HOUSING. AND IT'S KIND OF A LOW RISK PROPOSITION BECAUSE YOU HAVE STUDENTS. THERE'S MORE COMING THEIR HOUSING AND SECURE IN THE FIRST PLACE YOU CAN FORCE THEM OR COERCE THEM TO COME ON CAMPUS FOR THE FIRST COUPLE YEARS WHICH IS A GOOD THING THEY DO BETTER IF THEY'RE ON CAMPUS. YOU KNOW THAT THEY'RE GONNA COME YEAR AFTER YEAR FOR. UNLESS YOU HAVE A GLOBAL PANDEMIC WITH I WAS A LITTLE BLIP SO IT'S PRETTY SOLID BUSINESS PROPOSITION YOU KNOW THEY'RE GONNA BE THERE EVERY YEAR YEAH YOU ARE GROWING EVERY YEAR. AND SO YOU GET INTO IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE WHY. YOU WOULDN'T IF YOU HAD A POT OF MONEY TO BUILD THE HOUSING IF YOU BUILD IT THEY WILL THEY LITERALLY WILL CON BECAUSE THEY'RE THERE ANYWAY. SO A LOT OF THESE CAMPUSES HAVE SAID THAT THEY'RE RUNNING THEY RUN INTO COMPETING- FINANCIAL CONSTRAINTS WITH THEIR DEBT CAPACITY AND SO I HEARD THAT OVER AND OVER UC'S NC ISSUES THE LAST TWO YEARS. AND THEN YOUR RESEARCH WHAT I 100% BELIEVE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING WHEN YOU TALK TO THE SYSTEM AND WE'LL GET TO THIS WILL BE PASSED UC AND CSU TO COME OUT. THERE SAYING DIFFERENTLY AND THEN WE HAD SOME CHANCES AT THE END WHO ARE SPEAKING SO. CAN YOU HELP US ADDRESS THAT ISSUE FIRST. EIGHT I YEAH I APOLOGIZE IN ADVANCE IF IT'S NOT A PARTICULARLY SATISFYING ANSWER BUT I THINK WHAT WE HEARD IS THAT. CAMPUS IS FEES FISCAL CHALLENGES AND THEY SEEM LIKE REALLY SERIOUS CHALLENGES AND THIS IS THE PERENNIAL WE TALK TO ANY LOCAL OR STATE AGENCY THEY ARE ALWAYS FACING A SERIOUS FINANCIAL CHALLENGE. AND I AND YOU CAN UNDERSTAND OUR REASONS WHY THEY ARE TO MAKE A HOUSING PROJECT PENCIL OUT. THEY HAVE TO BE SKILLED AT WHAT THEY'RE DOING TO GET ALL THE PIECES TO WORK JUST RIGHT THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO DESIGN A FACILITY. TO BE ABLE TO GO OUT THE MARKET AT THAT TIME DELIVER IT ON SCHEDULE ON PRICE AND THEY NEED TO HAVE THE DEBT SERVICE AND THE OPERATING COSTS THAT WILL GO INTO PERPETUITY THERE AFTER. AND PENCIL IT ALL OUT AND THAT IS DIFFICULT. I'M NOT SURPRISED THAT WHETHER IT'S YOU OR ME GOING OUT TO TALKING TO PEOPLE WE ARE HEARING THAT FINANCING AS A CHALLENGE. I THINK THE KEY. CHALLENGE THE KEY FOR POLICY ISSUE IS IT'S A CHALLENGE. ARE YOU PREVENTED FROM DOING WHAT YOU WANT OR IS IT A CHALLENGE THAT YOU FACE AND I THINK WHAT WE HEARD IS THESE ARE SERIOUS CHALLENGES BUT THEY DON'T PREVENT US FROM BUILDING. THEY DON'T PREVENT US FROM BEING ABLE TO. FIGURE OUT THE DESIGN OF THE BUILDING AND BE ABLE TO COVER THE DEBT SERVICE AND THE OPERATING COSTS AND STILL HAVE A MONTHLY CHARGE THAT IS WITHIN THE- REALM OF REASON FOR MOST STUDENTS. SO THEN IT BECOMES LAW HOW CAN THE STATE- HAVE A- IMPORTANT ROLE HERE- AND IT IT IS A LITTLE BIT TRICKIER BECAUSE YOUR- AGAIN WE'RE TRYING TO SIGN IN THE ABSENCE OF STATE MONEY WHAT WOULD OTHERWISE HAPPEN AND CAMPUSES ARE SHOWING YOU THAT THEY'VE BUILT OUR BUILDING HAVE PLANS TO BUILD THE MARKET IS SAYING IT'S A GOOD ENVIRONMENT TO BUILD- BUT THIS ISN'T SAYING YOU WILL NOT YOU WILL HEAR FROM DISTRICTS. I PROBABLY FOR YEARS TO COME THAT VACANCY RATES ARE LOW WAIT LISTS ARE LONG. HOUSING IS HARD ESPECIALLY FOR A LONG FROM FOLKS TO COVER- AND I'M SORRY TO HAVE SUCH A DISSATISFIED ANSWER AT THE MOMENT BECAUSE I'M NOT QUITE. UNFORTUNATELY I NORMALLY YOU AND THE RESURGENT GOVERNOR LIKE ALL THE STATE POLICY SOLUTION IS OBVIOUS THAN HERE AS YOU PROBABLY HEARD WITH ALL YOUR HOUSING CONVERSATIONS THERE'S NOT LIKE A SIMPLE OBVIOUS SOLUTION. MAYBE YOU CAN FIGURE OUT SOME PRIORITY RULES THAT REALLY GIVE THE GRANTS TO THOSE VERY ISOLATED AREAS THAT ARE NOT ABLE THEY THEY THEY PROVE TO YOU THAT THEY CAN'T OVERCOME IS MORE THAN JUST A CHALLENGE IT'S AN INSURMOUNTABLE OBSTACLE. AND YOU SOMEHOW FIGURE OUT WHERE ARE THOSE PLACES AND HOW CAN WE GIVE THEM JUST ENOUGH SO THAT THEY CAN MAYBE GO TO THE MARKET AND ACCESS THAT MAYBE THEY JUST DON'T HAVE THE RESERVE LEVELS BECAUSE THEIR DEBT LOAD RIGHT NOW IS HIGH. AND CREDIT RATING RAIDERS ARE LOOKING NOT THOUGHT SO MAYBE THAT'S THE AREA AND MAYBE YOU CAN STILL DO THAT IN THE MIDST OF THE NEW PROGRAM YOU JUST LOOK AT THE APPLICATIONS VERY CAREFULLY TO TRY TO MAKE THIS JUDGMENT CALL AS TO WHETHER IT'S JUST A CHALLENGE OR AN INSURMOUNTABLE BARRIER. YEAH I THINK THAT'S THE ISSUES THAT LOCAL FIRST. WE HAVE TIME TO FIGURE IT OUT BECAUSE WE JUST. WE HAVE THAT- DURING OVER THREE YEARS IF YOU WANT TO COME BACK FOR MORE. SO I GUESS THE ISSUE IS. YOU KNOW LIKE HERE IN SACRAMENTO. I USED TO BE ON THE CITY COUNCIL FOR TEN YEARS- AS YOUR COUNCIL MEMBER OF COURSE. AND THAT. WE A- WEEK SOMETIMES YOU DO LIKE TE KIND GAP FINANCING YOU LOOK FOR PROJECTS. FOR DOUBLE HOUSING PROJECTS THAT ARE. IN NEED GIVE ME A LITTLE BIT TO PUT HIM OVER THE TOP. SO THAT WE WANT TO DO TO JUST PUT LIKE A LITTLE BIT OF CASH TO PUT THEM OVER THE TOP THE DOWN PAYMENT ASSISTANCE. TO HELP THEM. TO LOWER THEIR AFFORDABILITY ABOUT WHICH WE HEAR FROM YOU SEE SAN DIEGO. WHICH IS WHICH IS CASH. BUT SOME OTHERS ARE SAYING WOULD EVEN NEED THAT WE JUST NEED US TO HAVE THIS POT OF MONEY OVER THERE TO ALLOW US TO DRAW DOWN. KIND OF LIKE COSIGN. AND SO WE'RE KIND OF AT A LOSS. WHICH ONE TO DO SO DO WE DO THEM BOTH DO WE DO THAT AS IS IT EITHER OR- BASED UPON WHAT WE HEARD THE FIRST OPTION SEEMS LIKE IT WOULD BE MORE PROMISING. AND THAT LIKE WITH A REVOLVING LOAN FUND ONE OF THE MAJOR ADVANTAGES AS LOW COST BORROWING AND THE FIELD IS TELLING U RIGHT NOW LOW COST BORROWING IS NOT AN ISSUE. INTEREST RATES ARE LOW WE CAN GO TO MARKET AND ACCESS CASH- BUT- BEING ABLE TO GO IN ACCESS CASH YOU STILL ON AGAIN FOUGHT TO HAVE THIS PROJECT. RESULT IN MONTHLY CHARGES THAT STUDENTS CAN AFFORD. SO IT MIGHT BE SOMETHING LIKE THE GAP FINANCING WHERE IF WE JUST GAVE THEM A LITTLE BIT MORE THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO PENCIL OUT. THE PROJECT- AT THAT WOULD OBVIOUSLY WE'D HAVE TO AS AN OFFICE THINK MORE ABOUT HOW TO HELP YOU DESIGN SOMETHING LIKE THAT. OKAY THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTIONS REALLY ASSEMBLY MEMBER RACE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AT AGE TWELVE YOUR REPORT I I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU THAT I'M REALLY ENCOURAGED. TO SEE OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES. TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THIS NEW HOUSING GRANT PROGRAM. BUT WE KNOW THAT MOST OF THE COMMITTEE COLLEGES- COMPRISE OF PEOPLE OF COLOR MAJORITY ARE- OUR OUR- AT 60% TYPE THINK OF ART LATINO STUDENTS AND ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS ONE OF THOSE IMPORTANT ISSUES- ESPECIALLY FOR NONTRADITIONAL STUDENTS TRYING TO JUGGLE BETWEEN WORKING IN SCHOOL AND WHAT HAVE YOU. ARE THERE ANY IDEAS OR PROPOSALS FOR MULTI CAMPUS STUDENT HOUSING GOOD COMMUTER COLLEGE PARTNER WITH OUR NEW- NEARBY UC OR CSU- TO BUILD AND SUPPORT HOUSING FOR STUDENTS FROM MULTIPLE CAMPUSES. AND SO THE NEW CASH PROGRAM DOES ALLOW FOR THIS YOU MIGHT HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THOSE EARLY CONVERSATIONS THAT DO MAKE THIS AN ALLOWABLE PRACTICE WHERE COLLEGES PROBABLY WORST YES YOU WOULD GET TOGETHER TO FIGURE OUT IF THERE COULD BE SOME- HOW HOUSING NOT PROVIDED MUTUAL BENEFITS TO THE TWO SEGMENTS. YOU CAN SEE ON PAGE TWELVE THAT OF FINANCE GOT FOR INTER SEGMENTAL APPLICATIONS- AND I I'M I'M NOT PRIVY TO EXACTLY WHICH CAMPUSES THOSE ARE I'M HOPING AGAIN. OVER THE COMING MONTHS WE'LL GET MORE INFORMATION ON THE SPECIFIC NATURE OF ALL OF THOSE APPLICATIONS. WHEN WE WERE TALKING TO CSU M. AND THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE THEY BOTH WERE EXPRESSING INTEREST IN THE IDEA I THINK WE WERE STILL AT TWO PRELIMINARY OF A STAGE FOR THEM TO HAVE. SPECIFICITY AND HOW IT WOULD WORK WHO IS WHICH STUDENTS WOULD BENEFIT WHERE THE CAMPUS- FACILITY WOULD BE LOCATED BUT I IMAGINE IN THESE FOUR APPLICATIONS THERE IS THAT LEVEL OF DETAIL PROVIDED- SO THIS IS ALL TO SAY WILL LEARN MORE IN THE FUTURE IT SOUNDS LIKE THE STATEMENTS ARE AMENABLE TO THE IDEA AND THEY'RE TRYING TO WORK IT OUT I THINK THERE'S STILL THIS PRACTICAL ISSUE OF WILL THEY BE ABLE TO WORK OUT ALL THOSE REALLY CRUCIAL DETAILS. WILL THEY END UP BEING ONE OF THE SELECT APPLICATIONS THAT YOU ACTUALLY SEE IN MARCH DO THEY PASSED FINANCES. REVIEW PROCESS. OKAY THE THIS VIDEO YEAH THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- IN CALIFORNIA STUDENTS ARE NOT CONSIDERED A SPECIAL NEEDS POPULATION- FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING OR FOR REGIONAL NEEDS HOUSING ALLOCATION UNLIKE OTHER GROUPS LIKE AGRICULTURAL WORKERS OR SENIORS CAN CAN YOU TELL ME WHY WHY THIS IS THE CASE. I THINK TRADITIONALLY AND THIS CAN BE FOUND ON REMANENCE OF I THINK FEDERAL AND STATE LAW. STUDENTS HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN VIEWED- MORE AS LIKE AN ADVANTAGE GROUP BECAUSE THESE ARE STUDENTS WHO HAVE GRADUATED FROM HIGH SCHOOL JUMP THROUGH THE HOOPS OF ENDING UP ON A POST SECONDARY INSTITUTION AND IF THEY'RE ABLE TO COMPLETE THEIR POST SECONDARY EXPERIENCE. ARE MORE LIKELY BASED UPON DATA THAT SUITS YOU ON AVERAGE GET A JOB HAVE A LIVING WAGE BE RESILIENT AND THE TYPES OF JOBS THEY HAVE AND THEIR ABILITY TO STAY EMPLOYED- SO IF YOU COMPARE A TWENTY YEAR OLD WHETHER THEY'RE AT THE CSU OR THE UC CAMPUS WITH A TWENTY YEAR OLDS WHO. NEVER GOT ON THAT CAMPUS AND IS WORKING ON TRYING TO MAKE ENDS MEET I THINK IT'S STILL AN IMPORTANT CONVERSATION FOR YOU LIKE WHICH IS MORE OR LESS ADVANTAGED BUT I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY WHY THEY HAVEN'T BEEN. CALLED OUT AS A SPECIAL A DISADVANTAGED GROUP IN THEIR ENTIRETY. THANK YOU. OKAY NOT VERY HARD FOR. YEAH WE HAVE ONE PERSON. YEAH. YEAH. OF DIFFERENT VALUES- YEAH DR ED OKAY GO AHEAD ALL RIGHT. AND WE HAVE- PREFECT MAKES THE SEGMENT WILL HAVE. FIVE YOU PROBABLY TIME. RIGHT THERE UNTIL MID NOW WASN'T ON HE SEGMENT HAVE. WE'LL HAVE. FIVE MINUTES AND SELL IT YOU'LL HAVE ENTIRE FIVE MINUTES IN THE CSU AND UC WE'RE GONNA SPLIT UP YOUR TIME- ACCORDINGLY FOR FIVE MINUTES A THREE SEGMENT THANK YOU. THANK YOU TO MCCARTY GOOD MORNING MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M NATHAN BROSTROM ON THE CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER FOR THE UC SYSTEM- THIS MORNING HOWEVER I SPEAK KIND OF PERSONAL EXPERIENCE I SERVED AS THE INTERIM CHANCELLOR AT UC MERCED- NINETEEN TWENTY AND DURING THAT TIME ACTUALLY LIVED IN AN APARTMENT ONE OF THE DORMS SO I CAN TELL YOU FIRSTHAND THE- JOYS AND CHALLENGES OF STUDENT HOUSING. AS CHAIR MENTIONED AFFORDABLE STUDENT HOUSING IS A KEY COMPONENT OF AN AFFORDABLE AND ACCESSIBLE EDUCATION MANY OF OUR CAMPUSES ARE LOCATED IN SOME OF THE MOST EXPENSIVE RENTAL MARKETS IN THE COUNTRY SO WHY WE'VE LAUNCHED. THE STUDENT HOUSING INITIATIVE WE ACTUALLY LAUNCHED IN TWENTY SIXTEEN TO EXPAND ON CAMPUS HOUSING CAPACITY AT THAT TIME WE HAD OVER EIGHTY SEVEN THOUSAND YOU SEE STUDENTS WHO LIVED IN UNIVERSITY PROVIDED HOUSING. AND THE INITIATIVE SOUGHT TO PROVIDE AN ADDITIONAL. FOURTEEN THOUSAND NEW- CAMPUS HOUSING BEDS. I GIVEN THE CAN. OF STUDENT HOUSING PROJECTS AS THE ELLIE- MENTIONED THERE IS NO ONE SIZE FITS ALL DEVELOPMENT MODEL. OUR STRATEGY HAS BEEN TO USE A MULTI FACETED APPROACH TO LEVERAGE THE BENEFITS OF VARIOUS DELIVERY AND FINANCING MODELS. ACROSS THE SYSTEM. THE CHALLENGE AS A BUILDING AFFORDABLE STUDENT HOUSING AND HIGH COST MARKETS. WITH LIMITED UNDEVELOPED CAMPUS LAND LET US TO PURSUE SEVERAL STRATEGIES ALL OF WHICH HAVE PROVED EFFECTIVE. FOR EXAMPLE WE RECENTLY UPDATED OUR GET POLICY. TO RECOGNIZE THE REALITIES OF STUDENT HOUSING PROJECTS. WHICH OFTEN THE SUPPORT OF THE AUXILIARY SYSTEM FOR THE FIRST FEW YEARS. WE STRATEGICALLY USED A VARIETY OF THE VEHICLES TO FINANCING HOUSING SYSTEM WIDE TO SECURE LOW COST FINANCING WHICH IS AS THE ELLIE- SAID ON V. KEY DRIVER NOT BEEN GREATER AFFORDABILITY. WITH ACCELERATED PLAN HOUSING PROJECTS AND EVALUATED OPPORTUNITIES TO BOTH PURCHASE AND LEASE HOUSING. INCLUDING USING UP PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS. AND ENSURE THAT THESE PROJECTS SERVE ALL OUR STUDENTS WE CONTINUALLY EVALUATE. ALL FUNDING DELIVERY MODELS TO MAINTAIN THE AFFORDABILITY. IN THE PAST YEAR WE FINANCED EIGHT STUDENT HOUSING PROJECTS WITH FIVE CAMPUSES USING BOTH OUR OWN LIMITED PROJECT REVENUE BOND CREDIT. AT A COST OF LESS THAN THREE PERCENT. FOR TERMS OF THIRTY YEARS AND GREATER. ARE SIMILARLY WE ALSO FINANCE TO PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS ADDING OVER TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED BEDS TO THE DAVIS AND IRVINE CAMPUSES- AGAIN BOTH ACOSTA CAPITAL LESS THAN THAN 3% THESE EFFORTS HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL AND WE HAVE ADDED OVER TWENTY TWO THOUSAND BED SINCE THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF A STUDENT HOUSING INITIATIVES. AND WE PLAN TO AT LEAST MATCH THAT AMOUNT IN THE COMING SIX YEARS. STILL CAMPUSES STRUGGLE PROVIDE ENOUGH CAMPUS AFFORDABLE HOUSING TO MEET THE STUDENT DEMAND DUE TO ENROLLMENT GROWTH. AS WELL AS THE INCREASINGLY UNAFFORDABLE HOUSING COSTS IN THE SURROUNDING MARKETS. MANY OF OUR CAMPUSES ARE LARGELY BUILT OUT. WITH AVAILABLE SITES ONLY ON THE CAMPUS PERIMETER OR IN THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY. ARE THE REDEVELOPMENT PEOPLE'S PARK IN BERKELEY PROVIDES A GOOD EXAMPLE BOTH THE CHALLENGES WITH USING CAMPUS SOME LAND IN A NEW WAY BUT ALSO OUR COMMITMENT TO THE PROCESS OF UTILIZING THIS LAND. AS THE L. L. MENTIONED SEQUEL EDUCATION IS ANOTHER CHALLENGES THAT MANY CAMPUSES HAVE FACED. AND A SLOWED ARE ABILITY TO DELIVER HOUSING PROJECTS IN THESE DELAYS HAVE RESULTED IN INCREASING COSTS. FOR THE OTHER PROJECTS. SEQUEL INDICATIONS EASILY PURSUED BY ANYONE OPPOSED TO NEW DEVELOPMENT OR ENROLLMENT GROWTH OR WHO WANT TO USE IT AS A NEGOTIATION TACTIC. IF NOT SETTLED THIS TYPE OF LITIGATION CAN TAKE YEARS TO RESOLVE THROUGH THE COURT SYSTEM AN APPEAL PROCESS. AND DELAYS IN THE PROJECT INCREASE CONSTRUCTION COSTS AND SLOW THE AVAILABILITY OF BEDS TO OUR STUDENTS. WITHOUT REFORM A SEQUEL WILL CONTINUE TO SLOW DOWN OR PREVENT THE DEVELOPMENT OF THOUSANDS OF URGENTLY NEEDED. A STUDENT AT. UNDER CURRENT CONDITIONS WITHOUT THE STATE PROGRAM BECAUSE YOU SEE ON AVERAGE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED TO TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PER BED TO COMPLETE A NEW HOUSING PROJECT. THAT EQUATES TO ABOUT A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR EVERY FOUR HUNDRED NEW CAMPUS BEDS. THAT WE ADD TO THE SYSTEM. OUR DURING THE LAST BUDGET CYCLE- THE LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR CREATED THE HIGHER EDUCATION STUDENT HOUSING GRANT PROGRAM. WHICH PROVIDES STATE FUNDING FOR AFFORDABLE STUDENT HOUSING- CONSTRUCTION. WE HAVE APPLIED FOR THESE FUNDS IN ANY FUNDS WE WOULD USE WOULD WREAK READ- WOULD RESULT IN KEEPING PROJECT DEBT TO A MINIMUM AND OFFERING MORE LOW INCOME STUDENTS AFFORDABLE- CAMPUS OPTIONS AND WE ARE EXCITED ABOUT THE PROGRAM. AND GRATEFUL TO THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR FOR THAT THE FOR CITING CREATING IT- GERMAN PARTY MIGHT SAY IN ADDITION TO THIS GRANT PROGRAM- WE WOULD ALSO BE INTERESTED IN IF THE LEGISLATURE TO PROVIDE. A YOU SEE WITH LONG TERM SUSTAINED FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE- ARE THROUGH WITH NO INTEREST REVOLVING LOAN FUND. FOR EXAMPLE OVER THIRTY YEAR PERIOD A TWO BILLION DOLLAR STATE- ZERO INTEREST REVOLVING LOAN FUND WOULD SAVE OUR CAMPUSES. EIGHTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY WHEN COMPARED TO OUR CURRENT- BARRING RATE. AND SUCH A FUND WOULD ALLOW US TO BOTH- REDEPLOY THE PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS ON NEW PROJECTS. AND THE CAMPUS IS WITH SAVE ON THE INTEREST EXPENSE. AND THEN THE SAVINGS WOULD THEN BE PASSED ON TO THE STUDENTS IN LOWER HOUSING COSTS. WHICH ARE NOW THE MOST SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF. OUR STUDENTS TOTAL COSTS OF EDUCATION. SO LOOK FOR TO PARTNER WITH YOU I FINDING. WAYS FOR YOU SEE TO CONTINUE TO ENSURE THAT OUR STUDENTS HAVE ACCESS. TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION THIS MORNING. OKAY THANK YOU. SO CAN YOU CAN YOU ADDRESS THAT THAT THIS QUESTION THAT WE'RE GOING TO HEAR LATER FROM YOUR CHANCELLOR IS THAT- SANTA CRUZ AND SAN DIEGO AND YOU- NATHAN MISTER ROACH I'M- GONNA HAVE A UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE BEING AT THE OFFICE THE PRESIDENT GOING TO A CAMPUS FOR A COUPLE YEARS TO FOCUS ON. IS THIS NOTION THAT- THAT THIS DEBT CAPACITY THING IMPAX CAMPUSES TO PULL THE TRIGGER AND MAKE THESE PROJECTS A REALITY. SO YEAH DALY L. CERTIFIED ISSUE AND SOME YOUR CAMPUS SAY IT IS AN ISSUE BOB WHAT DO YOU SAY IT IS NOT IT IS NOT AN ISSUE WE HAVE WE ARE CURRENTLY IN OUR OUR LIMITED PROJECT REVENUE BONDS WERE RATED DOUBLE A THREE WHICH IS A VERY STRONG RATING HAS BECAUSE WE DO IT ON A PORTFOLIO BASIS SO ALL OF THE HOUSING IN THE WHOLE SYSTEM. COVERS THE DAT- ACROSS THE SYSTEM THAT ENABLES US TO BRING PROJECTS AND KEEP THEM AFFORDABLE FROM A VERY EARLY EARLY STAGE ON IT'S ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WE'RE SEEING IN PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS RIGHT NOW BECAUSE ONE THEY HAVE TO BE DONE ON A PROJECT SPECIFIC FINANCING AND SO THEY DON'T GETTHE CROSS SUBSIDIZATION OF OTHER CAMPUSES AND OTHER- PORTFOLIOS- AND ALSO WE CANNOT THEN OUR ISSUE BONDS THROUGH OUR SEQUEL EDUCATION. WHEREAS WE HAVE BEEN ABLE ISSUE BONDS AND SOME OF OUR CAMPUSES EVEN WHEN THEY ARE UNDER A COURT ORDER THROUGH THE- THROUGH A PORTFOLIO FINANCING- I AS I MENTIONED OUR R. COSTA FINANCING IS REALLY REALLY LOW AND A TRACTOR RIGHT NOW AND IT IS PROBABLY THE BIGGEST FACTOR IN OUR ABILITY TO KEEP THE- HOUSING AFFORDABLE OKAY SIX SO YOU WOULD SAY THAT. THAT THEIR REQUEST ARE HARD TO. DID REVOL FOR. WHICH WE THINK GREAT IDEA. WE INTRODUCED. LAST YEAR ON THIS IT WAS MORE OFTEN TO THE- BUDGET PROPOSAL BUT WE CAN REVISIT THAT. AND THEN TO SOME OF YOUR CAMPUSES ARE SAYING IN ADDITION TO THAT. IT WAS THE ONLY A TALKED ABOUT TWO IS FIND OUT. CASH STATE APPROPRIATION TO HELP. OTHER BY DOWN THE AFFORDABILITY LIKE SAN DIEGO'S GONNA MENTION A LITTLE BIT. OR JUST. DO YOUR- UP FRONT COSTS IN YOUR- TOWN HE ENDURED SUCH FOR YOUR DOWN PAYMENT WOULD HAVE COVERED CHICHI KIND OF CATEGORIZE THAT IS THAT ACCURATE. THAT'S ALRIGHT I THINK THAT THE REVOLVING LOAN FUND HAS ADVANTAGE THAT WE CAN BECAUSE WE CAN NOW LEVERAGE IT AND REDEPLOY IT. IT'LL IT'LL HELP US FINANCE MANY MORE THOUSAND BEDS. I MEAN I DO THINK THERE IS GAP FINANCING THAT'S IMPORTANT IN THE UNCERTAIN SAID SITUATIONS BUT- THE REVOLVING LOAN FUND ENABLE US TO BRING DOWN THE COST OF THAT AND THEN ALSO- REDEPLOYED AS A PRINCIPAL IS PAID BACK- SO. THEY HAVE THE ADVANTAGE THAT WOULD STRETCH OUT OVER DECADES- IN RUNNING OUR PROGRAMS YEAH. AND THEN YOU KNOW WE WE'VE SEEN SOME CITIES. YOU HAVE ALL THE- THE HIGHER EDUCATION IN CALIFORNIA'S MAINLY THE UC. WE HAVE. HUGE ENROLLMENT- DEMAND AND JUST LIMITED SUPPLY AND IN SOME OF THE UC CAMPUSES. LIKE BERKELEY AND- AND LA- SANTA CRUZ AND SANTA BARBARA YEAH WE'RE JUST. NOT IT'S NOT A PLAN TO GO AROUND SO SOME CITIES HAVE SUED AND GROUPS HAVE SUED AND- TWO TWO QUESTIONS ONE THERE IS APPARENTLY AT A LOWER COURT. DECISION IN BERKELEY. WHAT WHICH THAT- THIS WHAT IMPACT ALL. GROWTH IT FOR IN YOU SEE AND CAN CALIFORNIA CAMPUSES THAT YOU MUST HAVE ONE FOR ONE- NEW NEW BAD WHEN YOU BRING ON THE STUDENTS RELATED TO YOUR LONG RANGE PLAN CAN YOU GIVE US AN UPDATE ON THAT. YEAH THE LOWER COURT ACTUALLY RULED THAT ENROLLMENT WAS A VIABLE- A FACTOR IN IN SECRET DETERMINATIONS WHICH THE NEVER BAN- A PREVIOUSLY AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE WILL BE CHALLENGING BUT MOST OF OUR SETTLEMENTS- AS YOU KNOW CHAIR MCCARTY DO INVOLVE FOR EXAMPLE YOU KNOW SANTA CRUZ IN THEIR LONG RANGE DEVELOPMENT PLAN SAID THAT THEY WOULD BUILD A NEW BAD FOR EVERY SINGLE STUDENT. THAT WAS BROUGHT ON UC SANTA BARBARA- HAD SAID THE- THE- THE SAME THING YOU KNOW THEY'RE UNDER POTENTIAL THREAT FROM THE CITY BELIEVED ON- ON ON THEIR ENROLLMENT I THINK YOU'LL FIND GOING FORWARD ESPECIALLY IN THESE VERY- THE LAND CONSTRAINED CAMPUSES AT THAT WILL BE A FACTOR OF MANY. OF OUR A LONG RANGE DEVELOPMENT PLANS. OKAY AND THEN DID YOU WANT TO POTENTIALLY ADDRESS THIS. THIS UC SANTA BARBARA. ISSUE AND WHAT SOME OF THE NEXT STEPS ARE THERE RELATED TO THE- THE DESIGN AND I'LL SAY THAT I WENT DOWN AND TOWARD THIS FACILITY OVER THE SUMMER THE HOUSE CANCER YANG I THOUGHT IT WAS AN AMAZING IDEA. THAT YOU SEE HAS. UC SANTA BARBARA HAS A HUGE HOUSING CRISIS THERE AND I LIVE ESTAS OVERPOPULATED AND KIDS LIVING IN SQUALOR THERE. HE SENT TO HAITI IN ISLA VISTA. AND SO THEY HAVE THIS. THIS PAST WHERE THEY HAVE SOME YEAH. ESSENTIALLY THEIR COURTYARD AND SOME OTHER LOWER INTENSE USES AND SO SANTA BARBARA'S GONNA MOVE THOSE A MILE AWAY IT IS A PROPERTY THEY BOUGHT LIKE AN ABANDONED BAG. WAREHOUSE WHICH I THINK IS A GREAT IDEA AND THEN USE THAT AREA ON CAMPUS. TO DO A DANCE HOUSING PROJECT WHICH IS. GREAT YOU KNOW. INFILL ANYA SMART GROWTH. OPPORTUNITY THERE- AND WHEN I TOWARD I DIDN'T I DIDN'T EVEN RECOGNIZE TOWARD THE MOCK UP AND I DIDN'T EVEN RECOGNIZE THE FACT THAT BECAUSE IT WAS A MOCK UP WE DON'T HAVE ACTUAL WINDOWS THAT THERE WEREN'T. THE WINDOWS AND SO THAT'S BECOME THE ISSUE AND SO FORTH SO. I THINK THE ISSUE IS WE WANT MORE STUDENT HOUSING THERE WE LIKE THIS FORTY FIVE. HUNDRED INTERNET THING THAT ALLOWS US TO. MEET THE NEEDS OF SANTA BARBARA WHICH- YOU KNOW HAS A HUGE HOUSING CRISIS IN THAT CITY. THANK OF MISTER BENNETT WERE HERE SO EARLY MONDAY WOULD ATTEST TO THAT. BUT ALSO WE WOULD ENROLL MORE CALIFORNIANS THAT TOP AS YOU KNOW WE'RE BEEN HAMMERING ON YOU FOR YEARS ABOUT THIS AND SO. WE CAN'T DO THAT WITHOUT HAVING. TO YOU KNOW IN HUGE INFUSION OF HOUSING THERE ON CAMPUS SO- WHAT WHAT ARE WE DOING GOING FORWARD TO MAKE SURE THIS IS THAT THIS WORKS YEAH WELL BOB FIRST OF ALL TO ADDRESS- MISTER DONALD EARLIER QUESTION WE ARE VERY GRATEFUL WHEN WE DO GET PHILANTHROPY FOR. HOUSING IT'S QUITE RARE- ALL RIGHT IN THIS CASE YOU KNOW- MR MUNGER'S PLEDGED OVER TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS TOWARDS IS CONSTRUCTION. WE DO HAVE SOME CASES OF A BREAK THESE GETTING A- DORM THT'S BUILT. ENTIRELY BY AYE DONOR- AND THAT'S VERY APPRECIATED BECAUSE IT HELPS BRING DOWN THE OVERALL COST ACROSS THE SYSTEM. AND YOU SEE SAN FRANCISCO AS MR TANG- MAY KNOW- HAS RECEIVED SEVERAL GIFTS- TOWARDS HOUSING WHICH IS VERY. VERY NECESSARY THEY- ARE ON THE ISSUE OF THIS- HOW PA. IT'S VERY EARLY IN THE PROCESS REVIEW AND APPROVAL THE CAMPUS HAS NOT YET- EVEN COMPLETED THEIR- THEIR ER THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT- THAT WILL NEED TO GO NOT ONLY TO THE REGIONS BUT ALSO TO THE COASTAL COMMISSION FOR REVIEW AND APPROVAL. AND ALSO BECAUSE OF ITS PROXIMITY TO THE SANTA BARBARA AIRPORT TODAY ACTUALLY HAS TO BE REVIEWED- AS YOU BUT I DO KNOW CHAIRMAN PARTY BY THE HEIGHT- IF THEY HAD. THAT ALL THOSE- IT HAPPENS AND IT WOULD COME TO THE REGION'S FOR APPROVAL BOTH FOR SEQUEL- FOR BUDGET FOR DESIGN AND AN EXTERNAL FINANCING THAT'S SOMETHING WE'RE GONNA LOOK AT VERY CLOSELY BECAUSE- AS AS YOU MENTIONED EVEN WITH THE GIFT WOULD STILL BE OVER A BILLION DOLLARS IN FINANCING AND THAT WOULD BE A BIG PART OF OUR- OUR OVERALL LOVE. A PORTFOLIO WE WANT TO LOOK AT IT IN TERMS OF THE IMPACT ON ON CREDIT- YOU KNOW IT IS UNPRECEDENTED IN SIZE AND SCOPE IN DESIGN AND- I'M SURE THERE WILL BE A LOT OF SCRUTINY TO- TO THE PROJECT- BUT THAT BEING SAID AS YOU. AS YOU NOTED- UC SANTA BARBARA REALLY REALLY NEEDS HOUSING THEY'RE SEEING IT MORETHAN EVER THIS FALL. THEY HAVE THEIR A 118% OF THE HOUSING CAPACITY BECAUSE- I LOVE THIS THAT WE'RE YOU KNOW KIDS USED TO JUST CRAM AND THEY'VE THEY'VE- HAD MUCH. LESS DENSITY THERE BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC AND SO KIDS HAVE BEEN LEFT WITHOUT HOUSING. THE UC SANTA BARBARA'S BEEN DOING A LOT OF TROUBLES FOR DOUBLES AND QUADS OR TRIPLES AND THINGS LIKE THAT- AND THEY HAVE NOT ADDED ANY HOUSING SINCE THE FALL OF TWENTY- TWENTY SEVENTEEN SO. WE'RE GOING TO WORK FOR THE CAMPUS AND SUPPORT THEM ANYWAY WE CAN TO TRY TO GET MORE HOUSING IS. AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE- I ALSO THINK THAT THERE'S A POSSIBILITY OF DOING THINGS IN COMBINATION WITH SOME OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES LIKE. SANTA BARBARA CITY COLLEGE TO BUY YOU KNOW TO LOOK AT JOINT HOUSING PROGRAMS. THAT WOULD HOUSE BOTH UCSB AND SANTA BARBARA CITY COLLEGE- STUDENTS. AND QUESTIONS MISTER DON. IT'S JUST A BACK AN EARLIER COME YOU MAY WITH REGARD TO I BELIEVE UC'S CRUZ UC SAY BARBARA AGREED TO CAP THEIR ENROLLMENT- AND LESS THEY BUILT A UNIT OF HOUSING FOR EVERY NEW STUDENT DID YOU STATE THAT YEAH WHAT ARE YOU SEE SANTA CRUZ JUST PASS OUR LONG RANGE DEVELOPMENT PLAN WHERE THEY PLAN TO ADD ABOUT NINE THOUSAND STUDENTS OVER THE NEXT DECADE. BUT WHAT THEY'VE COMMITTED TO DO FOR THE- YOU FOR THE CITY AND THE COUNTY IS THAT THEY WOULD ADD A NEW BD FOR ALL NEW ENROLLMENT SO WOULD IT WOULD LET IT WOULD MITIGATE SOME OF THE IMPACT ON THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY AND THEIR RENTAL MARKET. SO IT'S BEEN OF THE OF THE OBJECTIVE. OF THE LEGISLATURE IN FACT JUST. PRETTY MUCH A COUPLE LEGISLATORS ARE HERE IN THE ROOM TODAY TO INCREASE ENROLLMENT. SO IS THIS SOME. SOME ROUND ABOUT WAY TO ACTUALLY. ENSURE THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO INCREASE ENROLLMENT- NO I THINK WE WANT TO INCREASE ENROLLMENT WE ALSO WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE BEING- YOU KNOW SENSITIVE TO THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY AND- SANTA CRUZ IN PARTICULAR THE CHANCE WILL BE- TESTIFYING BUT- YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S ONE. OUR COMMUNITY WHERE THEY THE- CITY REALLY FEELS THAT THE STRAIN OF THE GROWTH HAS BEEN- IMPACT ON THEIR HOUSING MARKET. WELL I LIVE RIGHT BY LONG BEACH STATE. AND IT'S A BIG CAMPUS AND I KNOW IT WAS THERE WHEN I MOVED IN. RIGHT SO I HAD TO PUT UP WITH THE IMPACTS AND I SEE A GREATER BENEFIT. TO THAT THAN JUST MY OWN HOME SO I THAT CONCERNS ME THAT INDIVIDUAL UNIVERSITIES WOULD BE ALLOWED TO. TO IN EFFECT LIMIT THEIR GROWTH. IS THAT WELL AND I DON'T SENATE REASONABLE CONCERN THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE NOT LIMITING THE GROWTH OF JUST SAYING THAT THEY WILL IT WILL ADD A BAD WHICH WE CAN DO. YOU KNOW WHY AND HOW THEY CAN'T DO THAT WHEN. THEY DON'T HAVE ONE OF THE DON'T HAVE THAT. RESOURCES TO A BEDS ONE HALF. WHAT WE DO ASSIST WE DO HAVE. AS A SYSTEM HOW THE ABILITY TO ADD MORE BEDS TO- YOU KNOW TO MEET THE GROWING DEMANDS. OKAY I'LL TAKE YOUR WORD FOR THAT BUT- I JUST GOTTA GET IN. MY CONCERN. WILL BE THIS BE SOME ATTEMPT BY INDIVIDUAL UNIVERSITIES. TO LIMIT THEIR GROWTH YEAH I KNOW IT WASN'T I MEAN THIS WAS DRIVEN MOSTLY BY THEIR- YOU KNOW NEGOTIATIONS AND RELATIONSHIPS WITH THAT. pCOMMUNITIES. NOT BY ANY DESIRE TO- I MEAN THEY WANTED TO GROW I MEAN BASICALLY GROW BY FIFTY PERCENT. BY PROVIDE HOUSING TO DO THAT. THANK YOU THINK AND I JUST ANOTHER QUESTION WITH REGARD TO THE UCSB PROJECT- SO I MEAN IT IS IT. IS YOU. THE IT INDIVIDUALS OFFER THEM TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. RIGHT NOW THERE'S ALSO OTHER. MONEY FROM THE UNIVERSITY COMING AND I DO BELIEVE THE PROJECTS LIKE ONE. ONE BILLION DOLLARS PLUS. I SAW HOW MUCH SWAYED AS AN INDIVIDUAL DONOR HAVE. OVER THE ULTIMATE DESIGN OF A FACILITY WHICH FOR WHICH THEY WANT TO. GET MONEY FOR THE- THE DONOR- I. TEND TO NOT HAVE MUCH SWAY THAT YOU KNOW THE DESIGN IS ALL DONE BY APPROVED BY THE REGENTS AND IS THE PROPERTY OF THE REGION'S- YOU KNOW IN THIS CASE THAT THE DONOR HAD SOME VERY. SPECIFIC IDEAS ABOUT- ABOUT HOUSING AND HE'S PUT THEM INTO EFFECT AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN SO- YOU KNOW HE HE HAS WEIGHED IN WITH THE CAMPUS ARCHITECTS ON THAT. KNOW WHETHER THAT IS THE ULTIMATE DESIGN YOU KNOW WE'LL HAVE IT WILL HAVE TO SEE THERE ARE. SOME ADVANTAGES OF IT IN TERMS OF AMASSING BUT THEY'RE ALSO SOME. SOME CONCERNS ABOUT IT. YOU KNOW ESPECIALLY IN A- A POSTCODE WORLD. OKAY AND ABSENT THE FINANCING. I MEAN. IT WILL LOOK BACK TO THE FOR. OTHER OTHER EXAMPLES ACROSS THE UC SYSTEM WHERE. A DONOR HAS GIVEN. A GOOD SUM OF MONEY AND THEY GET TO. HAVE A ROLE IN THAT IS THE DESIGN. IS INDIVIDUAL TO NOT HAVE A ROLE IN THE DESIGN THERE ARE. PROJECTS THAT ARE CALLED DONOR DEVELOPED PROJECTS WHERE THE DONOR WILL ACTUALLY- BUT- IT ALL HAS TO GO THROUGH THE BOTH THE CAMPUS DESIGN PROCESS AND THE REGION'S BUT THEN THE DONOR WILL ACTUALLY. THESE ARE MOSTLY FOR ACADEMIC BUILDINGS THE DON'T THEIR DONOR WILL ACTUALLY- CONSTRUCT THE BUILDING AND THEN GIFTED TO THE- TO THE UNIVERSITY SO SEVERAL OF OUR CAMPUSES HAVE EXAMPLES OF I DON'T TO DEVELOP PROJECTS. YOU GOT IT THANK YOU. I GUESS MY CONCERN IS THAT SOMEONE'S GIVING MONEY FOR A BUILDING AND I GET TO PARTAKE IN THE OUTSIDE OF THE BUILDING ARE THEY DRIVING THE COST UP SO MUCH. THAT IT MIGHT NOT EVEN BE WORTH HAVING THAT DONOR INVOLVED IN THE- OF THE CONSTRUCTION OF THAT FACILITY THAT'S WHAT THAT'S ONE OF THINGS THAT WILL BE LOOKING AT CLOSELY YEAH THANK I THINK THE AND THERE AGAIN THAT'S FOR. THE RESIDENTIAL HOUSING SITE AS WELL AS THE OTHER FACILITIES I JUST LAST ONE HAS TO DO WITH THE DESIGNED THIS BUILDING AND UCSB APPARENTLY HAD NO WINDOWS. AND I BELIEVE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND PROBABLY. PROBABLY NONE OF THE LOCAL LEVEL THROUGH BUILDING. CODES I DON'T BELIEVE WE CAN BUILD A BUILDING. A RESIDENTIAL FACILITY WITHOUT WHEN. YEAH ONCE- VETERANS AN EXIT- I HOME CAN'T DO THE- MIKE. RIGHT YOU KNOW HOME WINDOWS HAVE TO BE SO EITHER HAVE TO BE SO MANY. PER SQUARE FOOTAGE OF A BEDROOM. HOW WOULD IT BE THAT. A RESIDENTIAL COMPLEX TO BE DESIGNED WITHOUT ANY WINDOWS. WELL THAT'S ONE OF THINGS THAT WILL BE COMING THROUGH IN THE IN THE DESIGN PROCESS AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAS BEEN- ALREADY. YOU KNOW CRITICIZED IN IN SOME OF THE PRESS. IT DOESN'T- YOU KNOW I TOWARD THE MOCK UP AS AS- J. MCCARTY I DID. ITS THE- THE- THE BEDROOMS HAVE NO WINDOWS IN THESE VIRTUAL WINDOWS ARE. YOU KNOW WINDOWS. THE COMMON AREAS HAVE. HUGE WINDOWS SO IT'S- THE NOTION OF THE DESIGN IS THAT THE COMMON AREAS WHERE STUDENTS WOULD SPEND. MOST OF THEIR TIME IN THOSE ARE ARE YOU KNOW HAVE- AMPLE- LIGHT AND LOTS OF LOTS OF WINDOWS. BUT BECAUSE OF THE MASSING OF THE BUILDINGS A LOT OF THE- BEDROOMS THEMSELVES ARE INTERIOR. AND I GUESS IS THE UC COULD DO THAT BECAUSE- THEIR STATE AGENCY THEY WOULD HAVE TO FOLLOW- LOCAL BUILDING. ARE WE THOUGHT THE FOLLOWED. CODES IN. TITLE TWENTY FOUR AND ALL THOSE THINGS SO. BUT WE KNOW WE THAT'S ONE OF THINGS THAT WILL BE LOOKED AT- DURING THIS PROCESS SO AS SOON I'M ASSUMING. THE CITY OF SANTA BARBARA COUNTY SARAH BARNHAM WHATEVER MAYBE. DOESN'T HAVE AND I'M NOT ASKING YOU TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION DOESN'T HAVE A REQUIREMENT THAT YOU HAVE A WINDOW IN THE BEDROOM NO I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT WOULD BE A VERY UNIQUE YEAH MY EXPERIENCE WITH CONSTRUCTION THAT WOULD BE VERY UNIQUE- WITH THAT AGAIN I GUESS MY OVERALL CONCERN IS THAT. WE NOT GET HELD HOSTAGE BY DONORS WHO WANT TO A GOOD THING BUT THAT WE NOT GET HELD HOSTAGE BY THEM FOR ALL THE OF THE FINAL PRODUCT AND THAT WE NOT BE SO DESPERATE FOR MONEY THAT IT JUST DRIVES UP THE COST- OF THE END PRODUCT. YEAH I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH YOU. OKAY THANK YOU MISTER MEDINA. JUST TO FOLLOW UP. MY COLLEAGUE FROM LONG BEACH. THE CONTRIBUTION- IN THE UC SANTA BARBARA A PROJECT HIS HIS CONTRIBUTION IS- MR MUNGER'S PHILANTHROPIC CONTRIBUTION. IT HOW MUCH OF THAT- USER- REQUIREMENT THAT YOU SEE DO IT THE WAY THAT THAT- THAT HE'S ASKING FOR HIS CONTRIBUTION- THIS RE I DO NOT KNOW THE GIFT AGREEMENT WHETHER THEY'RE AT THAT IS THEY A REQUIREMENT I DO KNOW IT HAS TO GO THROUGH THE REGIONS IN THE REGIONS. YOU KNOW ARE THE ALTERNATE- DID WILL BE ULTIMATELY DECIDING ON BUDGET AND DESIGNED AND FINANCING SO THEY ARE NOT AT ALL SUBJECT TO DO THE GIFT AGREEMENT THAT THE CAMPUS MAY HAVE. GOOD WEATHER I HIS GIFT IS DEPENDENT ON HIS DESIGN YOU'RE NOT SURE THAT I'M NOT I'M NOT SURE. THANK THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU SO MEMBER TANGER BUDGET SHARE WELCOME YOU HAVE SOME COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR JUST QUICK QUESTION MR PRESIDENT- DO ALL THE TEN CAMPUSES HAVE BEEN LAID OUT. SOME SORT OF LONGER TERM HOUSING PLANS I THINK YOU MENTIONED THAT SOME OF THE CAMPUS IS AN HONOR FOR ALL OF THEM HAVE. CAN JUST TRY TO GET A SENSE OF CALM I KNOW THAT JUST ACCORDING TO THE RIGHT UP THERE ARE STILL THOUSANDS OF UNITS UNDER CONSTRUCTION. JUST TRYING TO GET A SENSE OF YOU KNOW OVER THE NEXT FIVE FIVE OR TEN YEARS HOW MANY UNITS ARE BEING PLANNED- FROM THE VARIOUS CAMPUSES YEAH ARE ARE MY OFFICE THAT COORDINATES THAT- MISTER KING AND OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. WE HAVE PLANNED- NEARLY TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND- ADDITIONAL BEDS- NOW A LOT OF THAT IS SUBJECT TO GETTING THE- THE PROJECTS APPROVED IN GETTING THEM FINANCED BUT- YOU KNOW AND MANY CAMPUSES HAVE ADOPTED PRETTY AGGRESSIVE GOALS ARE GUARANTEEING HOUSING FOR TWO YEARS OR THREE YEARS- AND THAT THAT IS YOU KNOW IT'S SAM UCSF WANTS TO DO IT JUST TO. ATTRACT AND KEEP. YOU KNOW STUDENTS AND RESIDENTS. GREAT THANK YOU. MISTER CHANGES ON THAT WE DID HAVE A BILL YEAR THAT WAS OUR BILL THAT WE DID TOGETHER THE REVOLVING FUND THAT WHEN THE BUDGET SO WE AMENDED AT THE END TO THE COULD BILL THE GOVERNOR SIGNED REQUIRING THE UC AND CSU TO GIVE US THESE FIVE TEN YEAR. HOUSING PLANTS SO YEAH. DO YOU HAVE A BALLOT QUESTION TO. OKAY-NOT MR LEE. THANK YOU JUST WANTED TO FOLLOW UP ON MY CALLER FROM LONG BEACH IS COMMENTS AS WELL SO WHILE STRUCTURES REGISTERS RESIDENTIAL STRUCTURES OF THE UC DON'T HAVE TO FOLLOW BUILDING CODE OF THEIR OF THEIR OWN RIGHT BUT NOT THE- COUNTY OR THE CITY'S BUILDING CODES CORRECT THAT'S CORRECT YEAH. SO IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES OR PROPERTIES. OF THESE THE ISLANDS- HOW DO YOU COME TO A CONCLUSION OF HOW DANCER HOW TALL HOW BUILDINGS HOW BIG THE STRUCTURES ARBY'S OBVIOUSLY THEY NEED IS VAST AND ACUTE. AND WE DO HAVE OPENING IS JUST LIKE IN SANTA CRUZ THAT. ARE SENSITIVE TO THESE THINGS BUT HOW DO YOU GO ABOUT PRIORITIZING THE NEED OF THE CALIFORNIA OF OUR SKILL FOR STUDENTS AND FACULTY WITH THAT A LOCAL JURISDICTION LIKE THAT. YEAH AND THAT'S THAT IS A- IT'S A GOOD QUESTION THAT IT'S A TRADE OFF THAT WE FACE IN EVERY PROJECT ABOUT TRYING TO. MAXIMIZE THE DENSITY IN THE AMOUNT OF HOUSING WE CAN PROVIDE BUT DO IT IN THE CONTEXT OF THE- OF THE LOCAL- A COMMUNITY AND OFTENTIMES WHEN YOU'LL HEAR. THE CRITICISM OF THE PROJECT IT'S NOT ABOUT THE PROJECT BUT IT'S ABOUT THIS THIS IS YOUR OR SCALE UP- AND- SO IT IS A YOU KNOW WE- WE GO BACK AND FORTH IN THAT IT NOT ONLY HAS TO. DO WITH STUDENT HOUSING THAT ALSO HAS TO A FACULTY AND STAFF HOUSING YOU KNOW IRVINE IS VERY EXTENSIVE- A PROGRAM FOR- FACTOR THE HOUSING WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE PROVIDING FOR AS MANY- FACULTY AND STAFF AS AS AS POSSIBLE SO. THAT ALL COMES UP IN THE- IN THE- IN THE DESIGN REVIEW IT ALSO DOES- CONTRIBUTE TO THE FINANCING- OF IT BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THAT. WITH THE DENTURE THE PROJECT YOU KNOW THE MORE REVENUE THAT CAN- GET THAT CAN SUPPORT THE- THE COSTS ABSOLUTELY AND THEN WITH THE EXEMPTION TO LOCAL. STATE BUILDING CODES ORDINANCES IS THAT ALSO TRUE IF SAY A UC CAMPUS OR THE SYSTEM ACQUIRES NEW. PROPERTY OUTSIDE ITS ORIGINAL FOOTPRINT- IT AND WE ARE- OWN. ENTIRE AGENTS SO WE HAVE TO FOLLOW US LAW WE ARE. FOR LOW ENTITLEMENTS YES WELL AS- I MEAN I JUST KNOW FROM MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE OFF OF SERVING THE ASSEMBLY AND ALSO WHEN I WAS A DAVIS THERE'S ALWAYS A LOT OF- CONTROVERSY ALLOWED CONTENTION BETWEEN THE DENSITY OF. OF HOUSING AND WILL COMMUNITY BUT I DEFINITELY STRESS FOR THE UC AND ALL. PUBLIC ALL THE SYSTEMS DEFINITELY HAVE THAT. A FRIEND OF MINE TO SERVER CALIFORNIA FACULTY AND STUDENTS OF IS THAT IS THE GREATEST NEED AND I HOPE TO SHARE THE SAME SENTIMENT AS ARE. CALLED ONE BEACH BUT YOU KNOW FOLKS MOVED IN. WITH A GREAT DRAW OF UNIVERSITY BE NEAR THEM I HOPE THAT THEY'LL BE ACCEPTING OF MORE PEOPLE GOING INTO THE DOOR THOSE BENEFITS. TO REALLY HOPE BILL PRIOR TO PRIORITIZE THAT. ESPECIALLY WITH THE LAN BEING SO SCARED SO MANY OF YOU SEE THAT WOULD BE A WASTE OF REAL ESTATE NOT TO GO DANCE OR NOT TO GO TALLER IF. IF ABLE. TO THANK YOU. THANK YOU YEAH. THANK YOU AT. SEVEN THIRTY HERE TO FOLLOW QUESTIONS. YES. JUST A MORMON FIVE QUICKS SO I THINK COMMON. YOUR ONE THE REASONS WE PRAY. HOUSING IN THE BUDGET WAS ONE THE OPINION THAT YOUR SEGMENT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES CSU TICKET FRANKLY BUILT MANY HOUSING UNITS FRANKLY CHEAPER FASTER. BECAUSE OF THE STATE AUTHORITY AS WELL AS STATE CONTROLLED LAND IN THEIR ABILITY TO MOVE THESE PROJECTS THROUGH OBVIOUSLY THE FASTER THESE PROJECTS TO BUILD THE CHEAPER THEY WOULD BE. AND SO I THINK. GIVEN THAT SO MANY OF THE CAMPUSES ARE IN VERY IMPACTED AREAS SO YOU MAY JUST HAVE A CISCO BUT- BERKELEY SANTA CRUZ DAVIS LOS ANGELES I'M IN THE LIST GOES ON AND ON HOW MANY OF THESE ARE. IMPACTED AREAS WERE- HOMELESSNESS IS ON THE RISE AND WE'RE SEEING UNFORTUNATELY A RISE IN HOMELESSNESS NOT JUST OF OUR STUDENTS BUT ALSO OUR FACULTY AND OUR STAFF. WERE WE HEAR TOO MANY STORIES WERE YOU HAVE YOU KNOW LECTURER SLEEPING IN THEIR CARS BECAUSE THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO LIVE ANYWHERE. CLOSE TO CAMPUS SO THEY'RE LIVING IN A COUPLE HOURS AWAY AND THEN- THEY ARE IN THE PROCESS OF JUST- SLEEPING IN THE CARS. SO I THINK I JUST WANT TO REITERATE MY SUPPORT. FOR ALL THE SEGMENTS TO REALLY. AS AGGRESSIVELY AS POSSIBLE BUILD. AS MUCH HOUSING IF THEY COULD DO I APPRECIATE THAT. THE DIALOGUE OF ALL THE LOCAL PLANNING CODES I THINK THAT IS VERY MUCH UP TO LOCAL JURISDICTIONS WE HOPE THAT THE PLANNING DOT. LOOK CAMPUSES CAN WORK WITH PLANNING DEPARTMENT PLANNING DEPARTMENTS IN CITIES I KNOW THAT THAT BERKELEY WERE WHERE YOU WERE AT THE SCENE A LOT OF CONTENTION WITH CITY FUND THAT'S BEEN ONGOING EVER SINCE I WAS A STUDENT THERE. SO I THINK IT IS IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO CAMPUSES HAVE A GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITIES BUT- HAVING SAID THAT THIS IS DEFINITELY A PRIORITY FOR US. WELL WE KNOW THAT. WE CAN'T HAVE A- ROLE LOOKED WITHOUT A HOUSING- WE KNOW THOSE HAND IN WITH THE HEARD. WHAT HAPPENED SENATE TO USE AGO WHEN I IN. HE SAW. THE CHANCELLOR DOUBLE SEND OUT THE- ASK PEOPLE TO YOU KNOW CAN THE PEOPLE PUT UP STUDENT AND PEOPLE TO PEOPLE PUT. UP RIGHT. AND SO- THIS IS WHAT PRIORITY IT'S THE THIS IS A LIFE THINK IT'S NOW JUST MONEY THAT WE YOU AN OF DISCUSS. SOMETHING THAT IS COMPLETELY SEPARATE FOR THE SADNESS TO BUILD. HOUSING AND I APPRECIATE THE TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND UNITS THAT IS BEING BUILT OR BEING PLANNED OF THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. I WOULD HOPE. THAT THERE IS SOME LEVEL OF DISTRIBUTION BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT- CAMPUSES- PARTLY BECAUSE- YOU'RE SOME CAMPUSES SAN DIEGO'S GET UCLA IRVINE- DAVIS HAVE BEEN A LITTLE BIT MORE AGGRESSIVE OTHERS ARE- YOU'RE STILL KIND OF LAGGING IN TERMS OF SANTA CRUZ OR SANTA BARBARA BERKELEY- OBVIOUSLY MERCED THE BRAND NEW CAMPUS IT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT. BUT I WOULD HOPE THAT THERE WOULD BE. EQUAL NUMBER OF DIPLOMATIC DISTRIBUTION BUT ALSO THAT SOME OF THESE CAMPUSES. REALLY- CATCH UP BECAUSE WHERE THERE'S LESS HOUSING ARE SOME OF THE MOST IMPACTED AREAS WHICH IS SANTA CRUZ SANTA BARBARA IN BERKELEY- PROBABLY THE- MOST DIFFICULT PLACES FOR STUDENTS TO FIND OFF CAMPUS HOUSING SO. I THINK IT IS. YOU KNOW VERY IMPORTANT THING WITH WANT TO MAKE SURE WE ARE. A SUPPORT THE CAMPUS IS WHY WE THE SIX AND- THE DIFFERENT CHEN COMPLY TO US. BECAUSE IF WE WANT TO KNOW WHAT OF SUPPORT YOU ALL NEED TO GET THIS. HOUSING BUILT BECAUSE WE THINK IT'S PART OF THE OVERALL HOUSING- HOUSING EQUATION IN THIS ENTIRE STATE. THANK YOU AND I'LL I ALSO APPRECIATE YOUR MENTIONING- TACKLING STAFF HOUSING BECAUSE IT'S BECOME A HUGE ISSUE IN TERMS OF RECRUITING AND RETAINING AND RETAINING. WE'VE GOT A GREAT MORTGAGE I PROGRAM BUT- ANYTHING WE CAN DO TO CAN. BUILD OUR OWN CONTROL COSTS IS REALLY GOING TO HELP US BUILD OUT THE UNIVERSITY. WE WERE ON WHEN I WAS WORKING AT SAN FRANCISCO STATE WE'RE VERY LUCKY. WE HAD A VICE CHANCELLOR WHO BECAME A CHANCE FOR ANOTHER CAMPUS. HAD THE FORESIGHT TO BARI A NUMBER OF APARTMENT UNITS ON A PRIVATE PER MINUTES AND THAT GOT THEM INTO CAMPUS CONTROL WHICH WAS A- HUGE WIN FOR THAT. FOR THAT PARTICULAR CAMPUS- THANKS FOR GRADUATE STUDENT AS WELL AS FOR FACULTY OFFICE. OKAY THANK YOU I JUST WANTED TO MAKE ONE ONE COMMENT TO I THINK MISTER O'DONNELL ASKED THIS QUESTION ABOUT. THIS IS THAT THE DAYS AGREEMENTS FOR ONE FOR ONE HOUSING. AND THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WE SUPPORT ITS RIGHT TO. TO PUSH DOWNTURN AS YOU SAID PASTOR WE TRYING TO PUSH OUT IN ROMAN. MY UNDERSTANDING TALKING TO DAVIS AND OTHERS IS. THEY'RE GETTING SUED BY THE CITY COUNCIL AND BY NAME BE GROUPS. AND THESE ARE PART OF THE SUPPLEMENTS BUT IT AND ALL THESE- IN ALL THESE EXAMPLES THAT I SAW FIRST HAND I'D I DECIDED THIS SUMMER THREE OF THEM. AND FALL CAMPUSES THAT TAB DISAGREEMENT REMAINS. AT SANTA CRUZ SANTA BARBARA DAVIS. THEY THEY WERE ALL IN THE WORKS TO BUILD. HOUSING WHICH WOULD. BASICALLY GO IN TANDEM WITH OUR EFFORTS TO EXPAND ENROLLMENT SO. YEAH WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE THESE THINGS STOP OUR EFFORTS BECAUSE AS AS YOU SAID. WE'RE TRYING TO ENROLL TWENTY THOUSAND. I'M NOT SURE IF YOU SAID THIS BUT IT DID YOU SEE A SAID THIS FOR TRYING ON ROLL TWENTY THOUSAND MORE. CALIFORNIANS BY TWENTY THIRTY AND THAT'S THROUGH FUNDING THEM THROUGH US WHICH THIS YEAR WE GREEN LET SIXTY EIGHT HUNDRED. AND WE'RE REDUCING NON RESIDENT STUDENTS AS WELL. AND YOU'LL SEE MONEY IN THE BUDGET A FEW WEEKS I KNOW SOME PEOPLE HAVE COMPLAINED WORK WE DID FIND THESE NEW STUDENTS BUT AS YOU KNOW ALL THE STUDENTS DON'T COME UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY TWO. THERE'S NO REASON TO PUT MONEY IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET FOR STUDENTS ACTUALLY DON'T SELL OUT. THERE YOURSELF. WE AUTHORIZE THOSE STUDENTS IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET AND THE MONEY WILL BE THERE IN A FEW WEEKS. IN THE GENERAL BUDGET WILL WILL WILL WILL- RATIFIED THAT WILL BE THERE. AT THE END OF JUNE TO FUND IS TO IS WHEN THEY COME INTO FALL TWENTY TWENTY BUT WE WITH MY NOSE MISTER. AND I WERE COULD MISTER DRAKE TO COME TALK ABOUT THAT. DEFINED AT LEAST. TWENTY THOUSAND BY TWENTY THIRTY BECAUSE WE ALREADY FUNDED SIX. SIX THOUSAND YEAH PLUS THIS YEAR SO THAT'S WHAT. YOU KNOW FOURTEEN THOUSAND MORE TO GO. FOR THE NEXT NINE YEARS AND I THOUGHT IN BUSINESS OR NOT YOU KNOW WE WANT TO FIND AT LEAST TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED. PER YEAR SO I THINK THAT NUMBER SHOULD BE BETWEEN TWENTY AND THIRTY THOUSAND. NEW SLOTS FOR CALIFORNIANS AND SO THIS. GOES HAND IN HAND TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR WORKING HOURS FOR THE HOUSING SO THAT HOUSING YES SO WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE WE ARE TOTAL SUPPORT TO MAKE SURE WE DO THEM BOTH. IT'S TO EXPAND ACCESS YEAH YOU JUST REPORT REAL QUICK KANA WHERE THISGOES IS. TODAY LOOKS LIKE IT'S TO UC'S THAT HAVE AGREEMENTS WHY SHOULD NEXT YEAR ALL OF THEM WHY SHOULDN'T CSU IS WHY SHOULDN'T COMMUNITY COLLEGES. AND THAT'S WHERE THIS THIS THAT THIS COULD GO. SO I THINK GIVING INDIVIDUAL UNIVERSITIES THE AUTHORITY. TO SAY HEY ARMAMENTS CAT UNLESS WE BUILD NEW HOUSING UNITS- CAN HAVE SOME UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. AND I GET THAT. PLACES LIKE YOU SEE GRANTED SANTA CRUZ ACCEPT OR THEY MIGHT NOT GROW LIKE GROWTH. BUT THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS COMMUNITIES CALIFORNIA HAVE TO GROW THEY HAVE TO GET THEIR RAIN AND NUMBER SIX ADDRESS. AND YOU SAY WELL WE'RE OUT UNLESS YOU GIVE US MORE MONEY FOR HOUSING IS AN ACCEPTABLE TO ME. BUT AGAIN A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM I WORKED HARD ON INCREASING OUR OWN BUT ALSO INCREASING THE DOLLARS THAT WE ALLOCATED YEAH BIG. BIG MONEY FOR- FOR HOUSING SO I APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU OKAY- MISSED. I COULD JUST COME YESTERDAY HAS COME YEAH I WOULD JUST SAY I THINK IT'S A IT'S AN EXCELLENT POINT AND I THINK- I THINK I WOULD JUST SPEAK FOR- OUR OUR HOUSE I DON'T THINK. THAT THIS IS THE ASSEMBLY WE'VE REALLY BEEN LEADING ON THIS ISSUE AND ROMAN SILVA I DON'T THINK WE CAN ACCEPT THAT AS AN EXCUSE. TO NOT DO THE ENROLLMENT THAT WE THINK THE SYSTEM SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO- AND WE'RE GONNA WORK WITH THEM TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THE HOUSING TO CLICK I THINK I THINK THOSE TWO THINGS DO NEED TO GO HAND IN HAND. BUT I THINK YOUR POINTS. VERY WELL TAKEN BUT I WOULD AGREE WITH YOU THAT THAT'S NOT AN ACCEPTABLE. ANSWER IN TERMS OF A REASON TO CAP. TO CAP FOR. CAN I JUST MISSED CHAIR YET. A AND I DON'T KNOW WE WANT DON'T THE LABOR THE POINT. HOW DO WE THAT. YOU KNOW. THERE ISN'T A UNIT. HAVE ASSED THERE IS A CHANCELLOR. SOMEWHERE ACROSS THE STATE. IS HEY THAT'S A IDEAS NOW THEY'RE GONNA. CUT DEAL. I MEAN SO. I MEAN DO YOU HAVE DOES. THE BOARD HAVE APOLLO. ON THE REGION'S YEAH THE REGION'S HAVE TO PROVE EVERY- LONG RANGE DEVELOPMENT PLAN IT COMES TWO TO THE REGION'S AND YOU KNOW SO FAR. ALL OF THEM THAT HAVE COME RECENTLY HAVE. ENDORSED MORE GROWTH. IT REALLY IS SPECIFIC YOU KNOW SO FOR EXAMPLE- THE MEETING NEXT WEEK WE'RE GOING TO- APPROVE THE LONG RANGE OF GOVERNMENT PLAN FOR UC RIVERSIDE. AND THERE'S NO RESTRICTION THERE I MEAN THE COMMUNITY SUPPORTS THE GROWTH THERE. YOU KNOW I'D SAY THE SAME AT SEVERAL OTHER CAMPUSES IT'S REALLY THAT THE ONES WHERE IT'S- A REALLY HOUSING- IMPACT LIKE UC SANTA CRUZ AND UC SANTA BARBARA WHERE. THEY COME BACK AND SAY- WE WANT. TO PROVIDE HOUSING IF YOU'RE GONNA TAKE MORE STUDENTS. I CANNOT. I AGREE WITH IN. UNIVERSITY SIGN OFF ON THAT POLICY BILLION I THINK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU SENATE MAJORITY LEADER RATES THANK YOU I WANT TO JUST GO BACK FOR A MOMENT ON THE SANTA BARBARA ISSUE I THINK IT'S CLEAR THAT WE'RE LOOKING UP THIS WE'RE LOOKING TO SEE HOW THE UC'S RESPOND TO THIS. AND I THINK THERE WILL BE LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE FIRST FROM THE FROM THE DONOR BECAUSE THAT'S JUST ONE DONOR WILL HAVE MANY OTHERS IN THE FUTURE AND GOING BACK TO MR MEDINA SO TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM RIVERSIDE- HIS QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER THE- CONTRIBUTION- WAS CONDITIONAL- ON ON MAKING SURE THAT THEIR PLANS ARE THE ONES THAT ARE IMPLEMENTED. AT IT I HEAR YOU SAYING THAT THAT WASN'T A CONDITION AND IF IT WAS CERTAINLY THAT'S SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE LOOKED AT IN THE FUTURE BECAUSE BY THE TIME YOU FIGURE OUT. WHETHER OR NOT YOU'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO COMPLY WITH THAT CONDITION THE UC'S ALREADY SPENT ENORMOUS ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY TRYING TO PUT TOGETHER PLANS. TO FIGURE OUT IF THEY MEET THAT CONDITION BUT I THINK. KNOWING THAT WE ARE SETTING A PRECEDENT IN WHATEVER IT IS THAT HAPPENS ON THIS UC CAMPUS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. FOR THE FUTURE- SO JUST WANTED TO. TO MAKE THAT COMMENT THE OTHER IS REGARDING- EACH OF THE CAMPUSES MAKING SURE THAT ALL THE CAMPUSES HAVE THE SAME AMOUNT OF HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES. I THINK THAT MAY NOT WORK ON EVERY CAMPUS BECAUSE THE NEEDS ARE NOT THE SAME. ARE THERE SOME CAMPUSES THAT DO REQUIRE MORE- STUDENT HOUSING. UP CLOSE TO CAMPUS OTHERS THE AVAILABILITY IS- THERE'S GREATER AVAILABILITY AVAILABILITY YEAH. I WOULD ALSO KNOW JUST WHAT THAT YOU'RE MCCARTY WAS SAYING EARLIER IS THAT THERE ARE TREMENDOUS NON FINANCIAL BENEFITS FROM OUR STUDENTS ON CAMPUS- YOU KNOW WE HAD A STUDY DONE IT. UC MERCED IF A STUDENT WAS THERE LIVING ON CAMPUS FRESHMAN YEAR THEIR GRADUATION RATE WENT UP ABOUT TWENTY PERCENT. AND THEY DO YOU KNOW IT REALLY IS HI YOU YOU CLOSE THE CAMPUS SO WE'RE TRYING TO ALL WE CAN TO MAKE SURE THAT. STUDENTS NOT ONLY COME TO THE CAMPUSES BUT ALSO CONTINUE- AND PERSIST AND ON CAMPUS HOUSING IS ONE OF THE BEST. PREDICTORS OF THAT SO IT'S ANOTHER REASON THAT WE SUPPORT MORE HOUSING ON CAMPUS. THAT'S WHY I LIKE THE IDEA OF MORE COMMUNITY COLLEGES ALSO AND I THINK HAVING THESE PARTNERSHIPS WITH OUR UC'S RCS USE. THAT ALLOWS FOR THE FOR THE TRANSFER EXACT COMMUTE CALL OPTIONS TO THOSE CAMPUSES. THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU. WE WILL NOW PROCEED WITH OUR REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE CSU SYSTEM. WE HAVE THEM REMOTELY. CHECK FOR STATE CHAIR MCCARTY. YEAH I SEE THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE OKAY THERE YOU ARE OKAY GO AHEAD. THANK YOU CHAIR AND TO THANK YOU TO THE COMMITTEE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE COMMENT. MY NAME IS A VIRUS AND ONE AND I'M ASSISTANT VICE CHANCELLOR FOR CAPITAL PLANNING DESIGN CONSTRUCTION FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY. WE APPRECIATE THE LEGISLATURES AND ADMINISTRATIONS SUPPORT TO REDUCE THE COST OF STUDENT HOUSING BY DEVELOPING THE MULTI YEAR GRANT PROGRAM. THE CSU SUBMITTED NINE PROJECTS TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ON OCTOBER THIRTY FIRST IN RESPONSE TO THE GRANT CRITERIA AND GUIDELINES TO CONSTRUCT OVER THIRTY THREE HUNDRED BEDS AT A GRANT PROGRAM COST OF. SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY SIX MILLION. MOST OF THESE PROJECTS ARE PLANNED TO START CONSTRUCTION BY THE PREFERRED START DATE OF DECEMBER TWO THOUSAND TWENTY TWO WHICH WAS ONE OF THE KEY CRITERIA FOR CSU PROJECT PRIORITIZATION. THE ONE EXCEPTION IS A PROPOSED PROJECT TO SERVE SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY'S OFF CAMPUS CENTRE CALEXICO IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE IMPERIAL VALLEY COMMUNITY COLLEGE. ADDITIONAL PROJECTS TOTALING OVER EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION WERE SUBMITTED BY CSU CAMPUSES TO THE OFFICE OF THE CHANCELLOR FOR THE GRANT PROGRAM FUNDING HOWEVER THESE WERE NOT SUBMITTED TO DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AS THEY WERE NOT PLANNED TO MEET. THE DECEMBER TWENTY TWENTY TWO PREFERRED START DATE OR DID NOT MEET THE CURRENT GRANT PROGRAM CRITERIA. THE UNMET TO BASED ON WEIGHT LISTEN TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN PRIEST PANDEMIC WAS THIS FOR OVER EIGHT SEVENTEEN THOUSAND BEDS FOR CSU. THE PROJECTS SUBMITTED FOR FUNDING. WILL BE PRESENTED TO OUR BOARD OF TRUSTEES TOMORROW AS PART OF OUR UPDATE ON THE CAPITAL PROGRAM WE'VE INCLUDING ATTACHMENT TO THEIR AGENDA ITEM THAT INCLUDES THE LIST OF PROJECTS SUBMITTED ALONG WITH OTHER ELIGIBLE AND INELIGIBLE PROJECTS WE INCLUDED THE CRITERIA CONSIDERED PRIORITIZATION SUCH AS THE PERCENTAGE OF LOW INCOME STUDENTS SERVED BY THE CAMPUS. THE CURRENT AMOUNT OF STUDENT HOUSING CAPACITY THE ABILITY TO ACHIEVE THE REDUCE RENTAL RATES AND THE START DATE OF CONSTRUCTION MOST OF THE PARTY PROJECTS ARE ON THE CAMPUS MASTER PLAN SO DO NOT ANTICIPATE SIGNIFICANT ENVIRONMENTAL OR COMMUNITY CONCERNS AND ONLY ONE CAMPUS IDENTIFIED CONCERNS WITH PEOPLE REGULATORY ISSUES MAINLY RELATED TO THE TIME NEEDED TO ADDRESS DEMOLITION OF BOTH YOUR PLUS BUILDING. AND TRIBAL CONSULTATION. CSU CAMPUSES WERE ALSO ABLE TO MEET THE LOW INCOME DEFINITION AS MANY ARE ALREADY BELOW MARKET AND STILL HAVE THAT REVENUES FOR RESERVES IN A NUMBER OF CAMPUSES. PROPOSED ADDITIONAL REINVESTMENT IN REDUCE RENTAL RATES USING NET REVENUES BEYOND THE BED CARE PROPOSED IN THE PROJECT. THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE FOR THE PROGRAM IS THE AGGRESSIVE TIMELINE. IT ASSUMES CAMPUSES START SPENDING NOW OR DESIGN NOT KNOWING IF THEY'LL RECEIVE FUNDS. AND WE'VE BEEN FORTUNATELY RECENTLY BEEN WORKING WITH THE STATE FARM MARSHALL TO SECURE DELEGATED AUTHORITY TO REDUCE THE TIME NEEDED FOR PLAN REVIEW. IF YOU CAMPUSES ARE ALSO PROPOSING TO RE USE DRAWINGS FROM A PRIOR STUDENT HOUSING PROJECT IS ANOTHER MEANS TO REDUCE TIME DELIVER AND PROJECT COST. TO MEMBER O'DONNELL'S QUESTIONS FAR AS THE COST PER BED. IT REALLY WE'RE WE'RE STILL LOOKING AT THE DATA FROM THE CAMPUS COST ESTIMATE FOR THE POST. CONFIGURATION OF THE UNIT THIS IS ONE OF THE FACTORS AS SALIENT PENSION TO IS THAT A CONFIGURATION OF A DORM OR IS THAT ITS CONFIGURATION SUITES APARTMENT LIKE WHERE THERE'S KITCHENS OF THE UNITS. THE NUMBER OF UNITS IS ALSO A FACTOR WITH THE- PROPOSALS WITH THE LOW NUMBER ARE DRIVING A HIGHER COST PER BED STAND- THAT- BUT STILL THIS GOT FOUR HUNDRED. ARE SO- THE OTHER AT ITEMS HIGH. BECAUSE SO BUT A CERTAIN THE COST PER SQUARE FOOT GOES UP. WHETHER INCLUDES DINING. IN THE COST OF THE PROJECT HEALTH CENTER FOR SAN FRANCISCO AND PROGRAMMATIC ELEMENTS THAT THE CAMPUS MAY DESIRE TO INCLUDE TO SUPPORT STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH RESIDENTIAL LIFE THE MEDIC PROGRAMS. A FOR EXAMPLE SAID THE- OTHER ITEMS THAT ARE DRIVING COST OUR SITE SO SIDE ISSUES DOES THE CAMPUS HAVE ENOUGH CENTRAL PLANT AND UTILITY CAPACITY OR DO THEY HAVE TO BUILD SOME CAPACITY IN. AND DONALD CUT COMING CODE CHANGES TO TRY TO DRIVE OUR REDUCE OUR CARBON FOOTPRINT AND INCREASED SOLAR PANELS FOR THE PROJECTS TO GET TO NET ZERO. WE HOPE THAT THE LEGISLATURE WILL CONSIDER CHANGES TO THE STATUTE TO PROVIDE THE SEGMENTS GREATER FLEXIBILITY IN THE USE OF THE GRANT FUNDS TO REDUCE THE HOUSING COSTS. THIS FLEXIBILITY WOULD INCLUDE ALLOWING RENOVATION PROJECTS THESE PROJECTS TEND TO BE CLOSER TO A HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND PER BED VERSUS THE TWO TO THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND THAT WAS MENTIONED EARLIER. IN THE BENEFIT OF THE RENOVATION PROJECTS IS THAT THE AVERAGE COST PER BED. RIGHT THAT INCLUDES. AS DIGIT REFERRED TO DIFFERENT ADDRESSING RENEWABLE DATES SO AND UPGRADING THE FACILITY FOR ENERGY CODE FIRE SAFETY AND ACCESSIBILITY. SO THE CSU HAS SUCCESSFULLY RENOVATED FACILITIES TO INCREASE STUDENT HOUSING CAPACITY BY INCREASING DENSITY TO THE EXISTING UNITS SO FOR EXAMPLE ADDING A THIRD BAD. TO ACHIEVE THAT UNIT INCREASES THE DENSITY SAID THE STATUTE WAS REVISED WOULD LIKELY PRIORITIZE SUCH RENOVATIONS TO FURTHER THE STRATEGY AND REDUCE THE CONSTRUCTION COSTS PER BED. OVER THE LAST NUMBER OF YEARS YOU HAVE HEARD THAT THE CSU HAS ADDED ABOUT FOURTEEN THOUSAND BEDS THROUGH A COMBINATION OF NEW CONSTRUCTION RENOVATION AND ACQUISITIONS TO SERVE THE STUDENTS. BEFORE I TURN TO MY COLLEAGUE MISTREATMENT TO TOUCH ON HOW TO STRETCH THE STATE ONE TIME FUNDING I DO WANT TO NOTE THAT ARE JULY TWENTY TWENTY REPORT TO THE BOARD ON AFFORDABLE HOUSING. NOTED AN ESTIMATED DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BACKLOG FOR STUDENT HOUSING OF OVER EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION. THIS EQUATES TO AN AVERAGE OF OVER THIRTEEN THOUSAND PER BED OF BACKLOG AND THIS AMOUNT IS IN ADDITION TO THE BACKLOG OF OVER FOUR BILLION FOR CSU ACADEMIC FACILITIES. THE CAMPUSES ARE ASKED TO BUILD MAINTENANCE RESERVES FOR BOTH STUDENT HOUSING AND ECONOMIC FACILITIES AND I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU GRANT PROGRAMS THAT PROVIDE SEGMENTS FLEXIBILITY TO DO STUDENT HOUSING COSTS AND ADDRESS STUDENT HOUSING FACILITIES NEEDS MORE HOLISTICALLY. IT'S ALL HEARD IT IT'S NOT ONE SIZE FITS ALL TO BENEFIT MORE THAN JUST A FEW CAMPUSES GIVING THE LIMITED FUNDING AND THE INTENT OF THE PROGRAM. AND ALL I'M IF YOU DON'T MIND I'LL TURN THE PRESENTATION OVER TO ROBERT SO HE CAN FINISH CSU PRESENTATION. BEFORE WE GO ON IF THAT'S OKAY. THANK YOU DEAR MCCARTY AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR INVITING ME TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY I'M ROBERT EATON I'M THE ASSISTANT VICE CHANCELLOR FOR FINANCE AND TREASURY AND RISK MANAGEMENT. CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY. WE'RE EXCITED ABOUT THE HIGHER EDUCATION STUDENT HOUSING GRANT PROGRAM AND THE OPPORTUNITIES IT WILL PROVIDE FOR OUR STUDENTS. WITHIN MY AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY. AT THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY. I HAVE OVERSIGHT OF OUR CAPITAL FINANCING PROGRAMS INCLUDING THE ISSUANCE OF BOND AT. YOU FINANCED THE CONSTRUCTION OF STUDENT HOUSING. THE CSU HAS BEEN SUCCESSFULLY FINANCING CONSTRUCTING STUDENT HOUSING FOR DECADES. AND THE PRIMARY FINANCING PROGRAM THROUGH WHICH WE CURRENTLY ISSUE DEBT IS THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITIES SYSTEM WIDE REVENUE BOND PROGRAM. THIS IS MY REVENUE BOND PROGRAM HAS BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL PROVIDING RELIABLE LOW INTEREST COSTS CAPITAL FINANCING FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY PROJECTS INCLUDING STUDENT HOUSING. IN FACT OUT OF THE APPROXIMATELY EIGHT POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS OF CURRENLY OUTSTANDING SINCE MY REVIEW BONTA ABOUT A THIRD TWO POINT EIGHT BILLION. HAS BEEN DEDICATED TO FINANCING HOUSING FOR CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY STUDENTS. THE SIZE AND STRENGTH OF THE SYSTEM I REVENUE BOND PROGRAM MEANS THAT WE DO NOT LACK AN ABILITY TO ISSUE DEBT. OR TO PUT IN OTHER TERMS WE DO NOT LACK DEBT CAPACITY ISSUED THAT INSTRUCTS STUDENT HOUSING. TO BE SURE WE HAVE UNDERWRITING STANDARDS WHEN IT COMES TO FINANCING CAMPUS HOUSING PROJECTS BUT THE SIZE AND STRENGTH THIS IS MY REVENUE BOND PROGRAM IS WE HAVE A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY IN WORKING WITH CAMPUSES TO MEET THEIR FINANCIAL. NEEDS FOR HOUSING PROJECTS. FOR EXAMPLE IF A PARTICULAR PROJECT WILL NOT MEET OUR DEBT SERVICE COVERAGE TESTS IN THE FIRST COUPLE OF YEARS OPERATIONS. BUT WILL DO SO THEREAFTER. WE WILL STILL RECOMMEND THE PROJECT OR BOARD OF TRUSTEES FOR FINANCING APPROVAL BECAUSE OF THE IMPORTANCE OF THE PROJECT FOR THE CAMPUS. AND BECAUSE OF THE FINANCIAL BY. OF THE PROJECT IN THE LONG RUN. WORKING WITH CAMPUSES OVER THE YEARS TO STRUCTURE THE FINANCING OF STUDENT HOUSING ROJECTS. ONE OF THE KEY AREAS WE ALWAYS LOOK AT CLOSELY. AND THINK THROUGH THOROUGHLY IS BALANCING THE FINANCIAL VIABILITY OF A HOUSING PROJECT. THE SUPPORTABILITY FOR STUDENTS. WELL AS GSU HAS BEEN INTENTIONAL ABOUT COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY FOR OUR STUDENTS. THERE'S STILL OPPORTUNITY TO FURTHER ADDRESS THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING NEEDS OF STUDENTS WHICH MAKES THE HIGHER EDUCATION STUDENT HOUSING GRANT PROGRAM. SUCH AN EXCITING OPPORTUNITY. AND YOU CONTINUE TO LOOK FOR WAYS TO POTENTIALLY ENHANCE THE GRANT PROGRAM. I WANT TO TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO OFFER ONE IDEA FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION ENSURE MCCARTY I THINK THIS GUEST YOUR EARLIER QUESTION OF THE ALEJO. GAP FINANCING. S. PRESENTLY ENVISIONED THE HIGHER EDUCATION STUDENT HOUSING GRANT PROGRAM SEEKS TO PROVIDE 1100% OF THE FUNDING FOR A HOUSING PROJECT. AND CERTAINLY THIS APPROACH WILL PROVIDE CONSIDERABLE AFFORDABILITY FOR MANY STUDENTS. HOWEVER IF THERE IS AN ABILITY TO STRUCTURE THE GRANT PROGRAM TO WORK IN COMBINATION WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITIES RECESSED MY REVENUE BOND PROGRAM. WE THINK THE POTENTIAL EXISTS TO A GREATER IMPACT BY COMBINING THE MERITS OF THE GRANT PROGRAM WITH THE STRENGTHS OF OUR SYSTEM MY REVENUE BND PROGRAM. THE IDEA WOULD BE TO UTILIZE CRAP DOLLARS AS A DOWN PAYMENT FOR A PROJECT AND THEN FINANCE THE BALANCE THE PROJECT WHICH SYSTEM I REVENUE BOND DEBT. BY LOWERING THE LEVEL OF THE PROJECT DEBT SERVICE WHICH IS A FIXED EXPENDITURE A CORRESPONDING REDUCTION IN RENTS CAN BE ACHIEVED. THUS PROVIDING AFFORDABILITY FOR STUDENTS. THE AMOUNT OF THE DOWN PAYMENT WOULD BE BURIED DEPENDING UPON THE UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE INDIVIDUAL PROJECT. BUT THE CONCEPT WOULD SPREAD THE GRANT DOLLARS OVER A LARGER NUMBER OF PROJECTS. THEREBY POTENTIALLY PROVIDING AFFORDABILITY BENEFITS TO AN EVEN GREATER NUMBER OF STUDENTS. AGAINI THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE CREATED AND I'M HAPPY TO ADDRESS ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT. OKAY THANK YOU- MY FORK FIRST QUESTION FOR- FORCE FOR CSU IS- IF YOU LOOK AT THE TABLE HERE WHERE'S THE TABLE MAYBE BELIAU WORK. SMARR'S NEWS DOING HOUSING SO IT LOOKS LIKE YOU HAD MADE JUSTIN HOUSING INC INC- BEDS. SAN DIEGO- SAN DIEGO SAN FRANCISCO AND SAN LUIS OBISPO- NOT SO MUCH FOR- THE OTHER CAMPUSES LIKE WE THOUGHT THAT THAT YOU SEE IT ARE THESE IMPACTED CAMPUSES WHERE YOU HAVE YOU YOU HAVE BASICALLY THAT THAT THAT NEEDS FOR TO SUPPLY DEMAND AND PUSHES FROM YOUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO BUILD MORE STERN HOUSING. I WOULD SAY THEY STUDENT THE DEMAND IS THE DRIVER FOR THE STUDENT HOUSING SO IN IN ADDITION TO THE CAMPUSES YOU'VE MENTIONED SHARE WE HAVE RECENTLY COMPLETED A SIGNIFICANT PROJECT AT CAL STATE LA. FULLER TEN IS UNDER WAY. AND SECOND ALSO COMPLETED A PROJECT RECENTLY. OKAY YEAH I SAW THAT. AND THEN MY QUESTION IS SIMILAR TO WHAT WE HEARD FROM. THE L. A. L. O. AND MR BRO STROM AS FAR AS YOUR OVER ARCHING NEEDS- AND WE'RE GONNA HEAR THIS FROM FROM THERE YOUR FULLER TEN CHANCELLOR IN A BIT. THE FAULTS AND PRESIDENT IS IT- RESOURCES TO HELP- MEKTIC MAKE THESE PROJECTS PENCIL OUT OR THIS KIND OF NOTION OF A OF A REVOLVING FUND. OR BOTH IT WAS WHO WHICH SHOULD BE. WHAT ARE THE TOP THINGS THAT WE COULD DO FROM THE STATE PERSPECTIVES. THE FOCUS ON AND YOUR STUDENT HOUSING PRIORITIES AT THE CSU SYSTEM. WELL I WOULD SAY AS I MENTIONED WE DON'T LACK FOR COUNTY DO. ISSUE DEBT TO FINANCE. OUR STUDENT HOUSING PROJECTS- THE BALANCING ACT IF YOU WILL IS THE FINANCIAL VIABILITY OF A PROJECT BASED ON THE REVENUES YOU CAN OCCUR IN THE EXPENSE DOESN'T DEBT SERVICE AND AFFORDABILITY SO I THINK THE VALUE OF THESE PROGRAMS THE GRANT PROGRAM AS WELL AS A RESULT IN. STUDENTS FUND A PROGRAM. IS THAT IT COULD IMPACT THE AFFORDABILITY. IT COULD PROVIDE IF YOU WILL EIGHT A SUBSIDY OR A DOWN PAYMENT OF SOME SORTS THAT CAN LOWER KIND OF FIXED COSTS THE CASE NUMBER OF ALL THE FUN- YOU KNOW THIS- THE UC'S MISTER BREWSTER NOTED YOU KNOW SOMETHING THAT 0% OBVIOUSLY WOULD BE WELCOME WE ARE A BET AND THAT FROM LOW COST CAPITAL. SO THE INTEREST RATE I WOULD NEED TO BE LOWER TO TRACK OF SPORTS BUT WE WOULD CERTAINLY WELCOME THAT AND SIMILARLY ON THE GRANT PROGRAM YEAH IDEAS BE BY DOWN THE AMOUNT OF THE DEBT AS THE L. A. O. SAID IT'S FAVORABLE TERMS IN THE SENSE IT'S REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF THE DEBT SERVICE IT NEEDS TO BE CARRIED CITING BOTH. BOTH PROGRAMS HAVE MERIT. OKAY THANK YOU TO TAKE. AT SORRY JUST ADD ON THAT ALSO. FOR WHERE THE LOCAL MARKET IS ABLE TO HAVE SUCH LOW RENTS COMPARED TO WHAT THE UNIVERSITY HAS. THAT WOULD BE ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY FOR US. ESPECIALLY IF WE HAD EXISTING CAPACITY- WHETHER IT'S- NOT REAL CAPACITY BECAUSE FOR SOCIAL DISTANCING. IF IT IF THE USE OF STUDENT HOUSING IS DOWN BECAUSE OF PRICING BECAUSE THEY CAN FIND THINGS IN THE LOCAL COMMUNITY. THAN SOME OTHER STRUCTURE COULD BE HELPFUL. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER TANK. JUST GOING BACK TO THE ASSISTANT VICE CHANCELLOR EATON'S COMMENTS SO ARE YOU SAYING THAT- IF WE WERE ABLE TO COMBINE THE GRANT PROGRAM WITH THE- BOND PROGRAM THAT WE THE PEOPLE TO GET MORE HOUSING BUILT. I THINK THE POTENTIALLY I THINK IT'D BE MORE FOCUSED ON AFFORDABILITY AND THEN OF COURSE AND THAT COULD POTENTIALLY TRANSLATE INTO MORE HOUSING- IF YOU IF YOU THINK OF. JUST SAY OUT OF THE- LISESI FIFTY MILLION SUPPLIED A GRANT PROGRAM TO A PROJECT TO CONSTRUCT THE FULL PROJECT. DO YOU NEED THAT FULL FIFTY MILLION IN OTHER WORDS A 100% FINANCING IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE AFFORDABILITY TARGET THAT MEET YOUR GOALS. PERHAPS TEN OR TWENTY MILLION. MIGHT MEET THAT AFFORDABILITY TARGET WHICH CASE YOU CAN FREE UP THE OTHER THIRTY TO FORTY MILLION FOR ANOTHER PROJECT RIGHT. SO AND TO THE EXTENT THAT AFFORDABILITY IS ONE OF THESE CONSIDERATIONS WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT A PROJECT DOESN'T PENCIL OUT AND WE'RE BALANCING AT FINANCIAL VIABILITY OF THE PROJECT WITH A FOUR BUILDING FOR STUDENTS. ANY DOLLAR THEY CAN GO TO HELP AFFORDABILITY HELPS THE FINANCIAL VIABILITY OF AFFORDABLE PROJECT AND THEREFORE- POTENTIALLY COULD RESULT IN MORE PROJECTS. SO WHAT YOU'RE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS RATHER THAN HAVE- ALL THE MONEY IS STILL FIFTY MILLION BEFORE COSTS ON ONE PROJECT CA CAL STATE LONG BEACH. SPREAD THAT THROUGHOUT A NUMBER OF PROJECTS WHICH WOULD PRODUCE. THE COST AT ALL THOSE PROJECTS NOT AS MUCH AS THE FIFTY MILLION ONE PROJECT BUT OBVIOUSLY YOU WOULD SPREAD THAT AFFORDABILITY. A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT PROJECTS IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SUGGESTING. YEAH EXACTLY AND THE AMOUNT OF THAT WHICH VARY BY PROJECT AND CIRCUMSTANCE. WE LOOK AT POTENTIAL IS THERE YES GOTTEN. JUST QUESTION FOR SYSTEM CHANCE ONCE YOU ADVANCE ON. THE FLEXIBILITY TO INCLUDE- RENOVATION PROJECTS I DID HAVE A QUESTION WHICH IS. HOW TRADITIONALLY RENOVATION PROJECTS ARE PAID OUT OF. YOUR MAIN INTEREST EARNERS WHICH YOU JUST MENTIONED DESERVE REASON WHY THERE AREN'T. ADEQUATE RESERVES TO DO THE RENOVATION THAT YOU'RE NEEDING AT THIS HOUSING PROJECTS. FOR SOMEOF THE PROJECTS THEY'RE QUITE EXPENSIVE YES STILL EIGHTY TO A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS SO THE RESERVES WERE HIT PRETTY HARD WITH CODED EVEN WITH THE FEDERAL FUNDING- THEY'VE BEEN IT'S BEEN PROVED BUT- FOR ONE PROJECT TO TAKE ON A EIGHTEEN HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR PROJECTS RECLINERS SERVICES DIFFICULT. GONE AND THEN WE DO YEAH. WE DO ENCOURAGE THEM TO USE RESERVES TO HELP BUY DOWN THE DEBT IF THERE IS A ISSUE WITH THAT WHAT THEY CAN AFFORD. IN TERMS OF A THE ADDITIONAL BED PER. PER DOLLAR INVESTED- WOULD BE CHEAPER TO DO RENOVATION PROJECTS RATHER THAN TO DO NEW CONSTRUCTION IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. BASED ON THE PROJECT'S CAMPS IS SUBMITTED THE RENOVATION PROJECTS PER BETTER CHEAPER. CAN YOU GIVE US A SENSE OF HOW MUCH CHEAPER WITH WITH THE WITH THE ROUGH. AT. THIRTY THIRTY TWO RENOVATIONS THROUGH INNOVATIONS THAT HAVE COME IN FROM A HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN THE HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO MILLION COMPARED TO THE RANGE OF THE TWO HUNDRED FIVE MILLION TO THREE HUNDRED PLUS MILLION. FOR NEW CONSTRUCTION. BUT WHAT'S THE PROVIDE COST I GUESS. THAT IS THE PERFECT COSTS SO BUT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION VERSUS TWO ONE FIFTY NINE SO I'M NOT A HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS PER BAD- RENOVATION THAT'S THE- PROPOSED COSTS FOR. THREE THE CAMP SINCE THE RANGE ONE FOURTEEN TO ONE HUNDRED TO PICK YOUR TOP OF THE OVERALL COSTS I'M ASKING WHAT WHAT THE PROJECT COST IS. THAT STONE UP. HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND PER BED OKAY YOU SUMMER RENOVATIONS AT A HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION. SKEWS ME SEASON WITH A HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND PER BED VERSUS TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND PER ABOUT. TWO FIFTY TO THREE HUNDRED PLUS THANK YOU. THANK YOU. PETERIK INCREASE CAPACITY OKAY QUESTIONS MR NEAR OKAY THANK YOU AND NEXT WE'LL GO TO OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE PRESENTATION. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OFTEN BITING ME HERE TODAY MY NAME IS AMY COSTA AND I CURRENTLY SERVE AS THE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE BOARD OF GOVERNORS. WHAT I THINK THE CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE IN THE ADMINISTRATION FOR PROVIDING THIS FUNDING THIS YEAR- FOR AFFORDABLE STUDENT HOUSING THIS IS A HISTORIC INVESTMENT BY THE STATE SPECIFICALLY FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES WHO TRADITIONALLY I WITH A FEW EXCEPTIONS DO NOT PROVIDE STUDENT HOUSING- IN AS WAS NOTED BY THE CHAIR IN HIS OPENING REMARKS THE STATE IS IN A HOUSING CRISIS THE DISTANCE A PLEA IMPACTS OUR STUDENTS. DISPROPORTIONATELY OUR COLLEGES OUR MICROCOSM TO THE STATE AND THEREFORE NOT IMMUNE TO THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS. OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HAS NOTED THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS IN THE STATE. AS A POTENTIAL RISKS TO THE OVERALL HEALTH OF THE STATE'S ECONOMY. ADMINISTRATION HAS NOTED. FINALLY OTHER LONGER TERM STRUCTURAL RESPECT PREDATED THE PANDEMIC REMAINS AND SOME OF THOSE RISKS HAVE BEEN EXACERBATED BY THE PANDEMIC. THESE RISKS INCLUDE CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING SHORTAGE. WHICH CONTINUES TO PUT PRESSURE ON INFLATION AND PRICES LIMITING CALIFORNIANS ABILITY TO AFFORD A HOME. INTERESTINGLY THE JANUARY BUDGET NOTED EVEN DURING RECORD LOW UNEMPLOYMENT. ONE IN FIVE HOUSEHOLDS SPENT AT LEAST 50% OR MORE OF THEIR INCOME ON HOUSINGCOSTS ONE EIGHT HOMEOWNERS SPEND 50% OR MORE OF THEIR INCOME ON HOUSING COSTS. BUT MORE THAN ONE IN FOUR VENTURE SPENT THAT MUCH. AT TWENTY NINETEEN HOPES IN A REPORT INDICATED THAT IN A SURVEY OF OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS 60% OF RESPONDENTS WERE HOUSING INSECURE IN THE PREVIOUS YEAR. 19% OF RESPONDENTS WERE HOMELESS IN THE PREVIOUS YEAR. THESE STATISTICS WERE PRE PANDEMIC SO WE CAN ALL STAND THE HOUSING AND SECURITY INCREASE FOR MANY OF OUR STUDENTS AND THE LAST TWO YEARS. GIVEN THAT HOUSING CRISIS HOUSING HOUSING COSTS CONTINUE TO INCREASE DURING THE PANDEMIC. NONE OF US CAN EXPECT THAT OUR STUDENTS CAN SUCCEED. WHEN THEY DON'T HAVE A SAFE PLACE TO SLEEP OR DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY WILL BE LOOKING. YEARS AGO I VISITED SIERRA COLLEGE NOT FAR FROM YOU AND I BECAME INTERESTED IN THE ISSUE OF STUDENT HOUSING- BECAUSE THE DATA WAS CLEAR AS MR BROWNSTONE RECENTLY STATED THAT OUR STUDENTS OUTCOMES OR BETTER WHEN THEY ARE SECURELY HOUSE. AS PART OF OUR VISION FOR SUCCESS HOUSING CAN HELP US ENSURE THAT OUR STUDENTS ARE ABLE TO MEET THEIR EDUCATIONAL GOALS. CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES HAVE CLOSE TO TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND ACRES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA PLANT. WE HAVE THE LAND AND WE'D LIKE TO HELP ASSIST THE STATE AND ADDRESSING THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS. FURTHER OUR INVESTMENT WILL IMPROVE OUR STUDENTS OUTCOMES. THIS IS NOT A FUNCTION THAT WE HAVE TRADITIONALLY HAD A COMMUNITY COLLEGES SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND THE ADMINISTRATION AND OUR SISTER PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION SEGMENTS TO BUILD OUR INTERNAL CAPACITY AND LOOK FOR AREAS TO PARTNER ON SOME PROJECTS. AGAIN THANK YOU FOR SUPPORTING OUR STUDENTS WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO TURN IT OVER TO MISS NOT RAT FROM THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE TO PROVIDE A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF STUDENT HOUSING. GOOD AFTERNOON CHEN MCCARTY AND MEMBERS OF THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE. COMPANIES WE COLLEGES STUDENT HOUSING REPRESENTS AN OPPORTUNITY TO ADVANCE OUR AFFORDABILITY AGENDA AS YOU EARLIER. BUT ALSO TO MEET OUR STUDENTS NEEDS. FURTHER YEAH IT'S ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY TO DANCE STUDENT SUCCESS ON AVERAGE WE COLLEGE STUDENTS SPEND. FOURTEEN THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED NINETY TWO PER YEAR ON HOUSING. TEN TIMES MORE THAN THEY PAY IN TUITION AND FEES. CURRENTLY ONLY TWELVE CALIFORNIA'S ME COLLEGES OFFER STATE STUDENT HOUSING. EIGHT OF THOSE HOUSING COMPLEXES WERE CONSTRUCTED OVER FORTY YEARS AGO. THE MOST RECENT PROJECTS HAVE UTILIZED SOME FORM OF PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS AS A MEANS TO MAINTAIN AFFORDABILITY PARTICULARLY IN HIGH COST REGIONS. AS A SYSTEM OUR COLLEGES CURRENTLY HAVE THE CAPACITY. TO HOUSE ONLY TWO THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY STUDENTS THAT IS NO WHERE NEAR- WHAT WE NEED CROSS ARE HUNDRED SIXTEEN COLLEGES. ASSETS FOR DECADES NOW SOME HOUSING HAS BEEN A BASIC NEED THAT WE JUST SIMPLY CAN'T FULFILL UNTIL NOW. THIS INVESTMENT CALIFORNIA'S MAHAJAN HOUSING CAN ENABLE FOCUS ON AFFORDABILITY BUT ALSO STUDENT SUCCESS. WE CAN SURE THIS FINANCIAL- ENSURING THAT% THIS IS NOT AN ISOLATED IMPLEMENTATION BUT RATHER A HOLISTIC VIEW. THAT OUR FOCUS IS ON A FRAMEWORK. THAT SUPPORTS FINANCIAL AID STUDENT SERVICES MENTAL HEALTH ACADEMIC SUPPORTS SO THE STUDENTS CAN ACHIEVE THEIR- GOALS. WE HAVE IMPORTANT WORK AT HAND THAT WHERE THE LEGISLATURE WILL BE A KEY PARTNER. AS A SYSTEM OFFICE WITH SEVENTY THREE INDEPENDENTLY GOVERNED DISTRICTS OUR CAPACITY TO SUPPORT THE COMPREHENSIVE IMPLEMENTATION OF STERN HOUSING IS STILL LIMITED. OVER THE NEXT YEAR WITH YOUR HELP WE CAN BUILD A COMPREHENSIVE STUDENT HOUSING STRATEGY THAT INSURERS WERE NOT ONLY IMPRINT IMPLEMENTING THE BRICK AND MORTAR COMPONENT. BUT ALSO CONNECTING THEM TO REAL SERVICES THAT. STUDENTS NEED. THE SAFETY DAN THAT ARE CAN SIX. AND THE ACCOUNT. THAT YOU DESERVE. THE CHANTERS OFFICE pKICKING OFF A STATE TASK FORCE FOCUSED ON HOUSING THE STANDARDS THE REGULATION THE DATA THAT IS NEEDED AND THE WRAPAROUND SUPPORTS THAT CAN ACCOMPANY HOUSING. ALL TO SUPPORT AND EFFECTIVE IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE DOLLARS. OUR GOAL IS TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE TO ANY COLLEGE THAT IS LOOKING TO INVEST AND EXPAND IN THIS IMPORTANT AREA WE WANT TO GET FROM STUDENTS TO FULLY UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY NEED. AND LEARN MORE ABOUT HEIGHT AND HIGHLIGHT EXACTLY PRACTICES THAT EFFECTIVELY DELIVER AFFORDABLE HOUSING A CROSS EYED OUR DIVERSE AT REGIONS. FURTHER ARE TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE SYSTEM BUDGET FOR REST INCLUDES A PROPOSAL FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF STUDENT HOUSING- SO THAT WE CAN DEVELOP A UNIT THAT LOOKS AT THE LONG TERM IMPLEMENTATION OF STUDENT HOUSING WE LOOK FORWARD TO ENGAGING WITH YOU IN THE COMING MONTHS TO HIGHLIGHT WHY THIS IS A KEY COMPONENT. OF AN EFFECTIVE STUDENT HOUSING STRATEGY THANK YOU AND WE'RE HAPPY. TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS OKAY. THANK YOU AT MISTER CAN YOU CAN YOU ADDRESS THAT THE ISSUE THAT I ASKED THAT THE CSU SO. AND I CAN I KNOW IT'S VERY DIVERSE THERE'S A HUNDRED PLUS COLLEGES AND- I FORGET HOW MANY DISTRICTS- DOZENS. WHAT IS THE REQUEST FOR. FOR MORE FOR ONE TIME MONEY TO PROVIDE GAP FINANCING. TO HELP THESE PROJECTS BECOME VIABLE OR IS IT. MONIES TO THE FUND MALL OR THIS REVOLVING FUND NOTION WERE AT THE POOL OF MONEY THAT YOU CAN DRAW DOWN FROM. AND BORROW MONEY FOR THE PROJECTS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE QUESTION THREE COLLEGES IN VERY EARLY STAGES OF ENGAGING IN STUDENT HOUSING. SO INVESTING IN INITIAL CONSTRUCTION CAN ENSURE THAT WE CAN MAINTAIN PROJECTS THAT ARE AFFORDABLE THAT ALTERNATELYHAVE AFFORDABLE TRANSFER STUDENTS THIS ADDRESSES SOME OF THE NEEDS THAT STUDENTS HAVE. IN TERMS OF WHAT YOU'LL RECEIVE IN- FINANCING OR FINANCIAL AID. LONG TERM A LOOKING AT PROJECTS THAT DO NOT GET FUNDED THROUGH THESE FIRST THREE ROUNDS OF STATE INVESTMENTS CAN BE A WAY TO LOOK AT HOW THE STATE CAN SUPPORT FINANCING OF THOSE THROUGH A MECHANISM. WE ALSO HAVE A DECENTRALIZED SYSTEM AND SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER THAT- WHEN WE ARE LOOKING AT FINANCING A STATE STRUCTURE IS GOING TO BE NECESSARY BECAUSE YOU'RE REALLY RELYING ON INDEPENDENT DISTRICTS. AND THEIR INDEPENDENT RATINGS AND SO WE HAVE SOME STRUCTURE BUILDING- AND STANDARDS THAT NEED TO BE DEVELOPED FIRST FOR CALIFORNIA'S COMMUNITY COLLEGES. YEAH MAYBE WE CAN TALK MORE ABOUT THIS BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THAT'S REALLY WHAT WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR AND I KNOW IT'S HARD BECAUSE LIKE YOU SEE HAS NINE. UNDERGRAD CAMPUSES IT'S EASY TO FORGET THAT COULD RATTLE OFF NINE IN FIVE SECONDS AND- YOU HAVE A HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN. WITH DECENTRALIZED. CAMPUSES AND SO. WE CAN'T PROP FIND ALL OF THE PROJECTS REQUESTED I MEAN THE POT FOR THIS YEAR IS. THREE HOW MUCH PARKING BECAUSE OF THREE THREE THREE HUNDRED MILLION IN SOMEBODY'S PROJECTS MAYBE A HUNDRED MILLION A PIECE TO FULLY FUND IT SO. IF YOU WANT TO STRETCH IT OUT WITH MAYBE WE DON'T WANT TO FIND 100% A PROJECT MAYBE WENT TO DO. NOT GAP FINANCING AND ALLOW THEM TO BE MORE VIABLE WITH YOUR EXISTING OPPORTUNITY TO BORROW MONEY FOR IT I KNOW SOME CAMPUS HAVE BONDING CAPACITY SO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IS IF WE WANT TO HELP YOU ACHIEVE YOUR GOAL AND I WOULD TOTALLY IN CONCURRENCE WITH WHAT YOU AND- BOARD OF GOVERNORS. KOSTET MENTION THIS TO YOU KNOW HELP STUDENTS SIXTY EIGHT AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE LEVEL WE HAVE TWO MILLION STUDENTS AND- AFFORDABILITY IS KEY AND YOU SAID IT PERFECTLY THAT YOU KNOW IT'S TEN TIMES MORE FOR HOUSING THAT FOR TUITION AND- YOU KNOW HAS WE'VE- BEEN CALIFORNIA MOST TUITION IS FREE. FOR FEES IT IN IN COMMUNITY COLLEGES UP SO WHAT DO WE WHAT HELP US HELP YOU DO WHAT DO WE NEED TO FOCUS ON. THIS REVOLVING FUND OCEAN OR- ONE TIME MONIES TO HELP PROVIDE GAP FINANCING IF YOU WANT THE STATE TO PAY. FOR IT. HIJACKS I DON'T WE'RE GOING TO BE VERY SUCCESSFUL MAYBE YOU'LL GET ONE OR TWO PROJECTS ACROSS THE ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BECAUSE THEY'RE THEY'RE VERY THEY'RE LIKE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR PROJECTS PLUS OR MINUS THE PROJECT AT. UC SANTA BARBARA. GRANTED IT'S- IT'S FOUR THOUSAND STUDENTS IS ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS SO. EIGHT I'M NOT SURE IF YOU HAVE THE ANSWER TODAY. BUT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR. ONE THING I MIGHT OFFER TO THAT CAME UP IN THE ANALYST- AND THAT THE COMMITTEE HAS DISCUSSED IS THE ABILITY FOR US TO PARTNER WITH THEIR SISTER SEGMENTS ON WE DO HAVE A NUMBER OF. BUDGET ACTION WHICH WILL BE- BRING THOSE FORWARD FOR CONSIDERATION. I WILL CERTAINLY LOOK TO THOSE IN THE FUTURE. ABOUT THE HIGH NUMBER OF APPLICANTS WHO ASKED FOR A PLANET GRAHAM'S- AVERAGING ABOUT FORMED A LITTLE BIT OVER FOUR MILLION DOLLARS OF GRANT SO- WITH THAT REQUEST DO YOU KNOW OUR FIRST YEAR ALLOTMENT FOR THE COMMUNICABLE JUST COULD BE TAKEN UP FOR JUST PLANNING AND ACTUALLY NO CONSTRUCTION IF WE HAVE STRUCTURED IT THAT WAY. CAN YOU GIVE US A SENSE- WHY THIS CAPACITY CAN'T BE ABSORBED BY THE CAMPUSES OR IS THERE SOME WAY TO ASSIST THE CAMPUSES- IN A MORE EFFICIENT WAY IT JUST SEEMS LIKE A LOT OF MONEY GOING TOWARD PLANNING WITH NO. CONSTRUCTION. YEAH I HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED THAT. AS I MENTIONED OUR COLLEGES ARE CURRENTLY IN EARLY STAGES OF ENGAGING IN HOUSING IS A NEW VENTURE SO MANY OF THEM HAVE TAKEN AN pNEEDS HOW THEY CAN UTILIZE THE LAND- AND HOW TO CONSTRUCT IN A MANNER. THAT MAINTAINS AFFORDABILITY SO THAT THEY CAN CANCEL OUT THESE COSTS- THIS WILL GIVE US. AND THE LEGISLATURE IN THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE. GOOD LANDSCAPE OF WHAT IS OUT THERE WHAT IT WILL TAKE FOR A LONG TERM INVESTMENT THIS SOAK YOU CAN STRUCTURE STRUCTURE THIS IS FOCUS ON FIRST FUNDING THOSE THAT ARE SHOVEL READY. BUT THE INFORMATION THAT COMES IN FROM THOSE PLANNING RANTS REALLY CAN HELP BUILD OUT THAT LONG TERM PROGRAMS THAT THEN- A GIVES US LEEWAY TO SEE HOW MUCH MORE THE STATE COULD NOT EAT. IN SETTING GOALS FOR AFFORDABILITY AND LONG TERM CONSTRUCTION INCLUDING BOTH MAINTAINING THE COMMITMENT TO THE ONE BILLION- INCLUDED IN SB ONE SIX NINE OR ALSO- IN TANDEM BUILDING POTENTIALLY. A REVOLVING LOAN IN THE FUTURE. OKAY I DON'T THINK I GOT AN ANSWER TO MY QUESTION LET ME JUST RESTATE IT SO ON. YOU HAVE SEVENTY ONE APPLICANTS ASKING. FOR THREE HUNDRED THIRTEEN. MILLION DOLLARS IS THERE A CHEAPER MORE EFFICIENT WAY TO HELP THE SEVENTY ONE INSTITUTIONS. WITH THEIR PLANNING WHAT DO YOU REALLY EXPECT THE STATE TO KICK IN THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO. HELP THESE CAMPUSES PLAN WITH NOT A SINGLE UNIT BEING BUILT. ONE APPROACH THAT AT GREATER SYSTEM WIDE STRUCTURE THAT CAN HELP COLLEGES BUILD UP PLANS FOR HOUSING AND THEY CAN PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THAT CAN- BUILD THESE LONG TERM PLANS INTEGRATED INTO THE FACILITIES MASTER PLAN PART OF A SYSTEM. AND SO THAT WORK AND THEN- SUPPORT AND REDUCE THE COSTS NEEDED FOR PLANNING GRANTS- AND THEN FOCUS ON CONSTRUCTION FOR THESE SYSTEMS. I THINK THAT'S A GREAT IDEA I MEAN IT'S MY HOPE IS THAT YOUR OFFICE COULD WORK WITH THE SEVENTY ONE CAMPUSES TO REALLY. FIND A WAY TO BE MUCH MORE EFFICIENT REGARDING THE- PLANNING BECAUSE WE WOULD RATHER HAVE THIS MONEY GO TO CONSTRUCTION RATHER THAN. THE IDEA OF CONSTRUCTION WITH THE PLANNING OF CONSTRUCTION WITH NOT A SINGLE UNIT BEING BUILT. ON WE DID SEE TWENTY ONE CAMPUSES APPLY FOR THE FUNDS WHICH IS VERY EXCITING COULD YOU CAN YOU GIVE US A SENSE OF. WITH THIS TWENTY ONE CAMPUSES ARE LOCATED WAS IT FAIRLY WELL DISTRIBUTED WAS IT. MORE URBAN VERSUS RULE OR CAN YOU JUST GIVE US AN IDEA OF WHAT THE- WHO THIS TWENTY CAMPUSES ARE. YEAH WE CURRENTLY HAVE A WIDE DISPERSION COLLEGES THAT WERE READY TO SUBMIT PLANS FOR CONSTRUCTION. SOME OF THESE ARE AND- REGIONS THAT HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY FIRES AND THEY HAVE SEEN THEIR HOUSING STOCK SEVERELY REDUCED LOSSES SEEN OTHER PROJECTS IN URBAN AREAS THAT ARE DEALING WITH DENSITY ISSUES OR AFFORDABILITY ISSUES AND- THAT LEVERAGING STATE DOLLARS CAN KEEP THE COSTS DOWN. BUT WE ALSO HAVE SOME THAT ARE IN SUBURBAN AREAS- THAT ARE UTILIZING SPACE AND MORE INNOVATIVE APPROACHES AS WELL AS A COMBINATION OF SOME THAT. ARE LOOKING AT PARTNERSHIPS SO AS YOU CAN SEE THE DIVERSITY OF THE- PROJECT BECAUSE MY COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE WIDE- AND- REALLY IS REFLECTIVE OF THIS NEW VENTURE AND PRIORITY FORESTS I'M- THANK YOU COULD YOU COULD YOU. SAY THE NAMES OF THE CAMPUSES AND WHERE THEY'RE LOCATED. WE DON'T HAVE A FULL LIST OF ALL OF THEM- IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO BUILD AS THE SYSTEM OFFICE HAS A GREATER CAPACITY FOR DATA- IN THIS AREA RIGHT NOW WHAT WE KNOW OR THOSE THAT HAVE SENT US COPIES OF THEIR PROPOSALS AS WELL. SOME AS I MENTIONED- INCLUDE THOSE THAT HAVE AN EFFECT FIRES COULD COULD YOU SHARE THE NAMES OF WHAT THE PERMISSION YOU DO HAVE. SURE WE HAVE SOME IN THE LA AREA- WE HAVE- CAMPUSES HAVE NAMES AND LOCATIONS. YES SO WHAT WE HAPPEN IS THAT A GROUP WERE WOULD YOU MIND SHARING THAT WITH THE COMMITTEE. DON'T WE THESE PROPOSALS WERE SENT DIRECTLY TO THE COMING OF FINANCE SO I'LL TELL YOU THE ONES THAT I DO NOW. SO WE HAVE A PROJECT BY SANTA ROSA JUNIOR COLLEGE. JUNIOR COLLEGE AGAIN ONE OF THOSE THAT HAS BEEN AFFECTED BY FIRES WE'VE A PROPOSAL BY L. LADY COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT. ANOTHER BY- PASADENA. THE WHOLE LIST OF ALL THE TWENTY ONE THEY'VE BEEN SUBMITTED STONES SINCE THOSE WERE SENT DIRECTLY TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND NOT THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE NO NO UNDERSTOOD BUT THAT JUST GIVES US. A SENSE OF WHAT. IS WHO'S APPLYING AND FOR WHAT REASON SO WE APPRECIATE THAT AND AGAIN- WOULD REALLY URGE THE SYSTEM. TO TRY TO COME UP WITH THE WAY THAT THEY COULD PERHAPS ASSIST. THE CAMPUSES AT LARGE I UNDERSTAND THAT MANY OF MOST CAMPUSES HAVE NEVER REALLY CONSIDERED- HOUSING AND HAVE ENOUGH TO REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT IT BUT- IF THERE'S A WAY THAT THE- THE SYSTEM COULD REALLY HELP. A SISTER OUT TO BRING THAT DOLLAR FIGURE DOWN I THINK IT BE VERY VERY HELPFUL THANK YOU. OKAY YEAH I KNOW WE'RE NOT DELIBERATING. ON THIS TODAY HOW WE'RE GONNA SPEND THE MONEY AND AGAIN. YOU KNOW MISTER. CHANG IS PART OF OUR PROCESS THROUGH THE STATE BUDGET CHAIRMAN MR MEDINA AND I AND THE OTHERS. WE WILL DECIDE WHICH PROJECTS ARE FUNDED THE THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS GO. TO THE GOVERNOR TO MYSTERIES IN THE GIVEN TO US. BUT THIS NOTION OF A PLANNING I THINK YOU BROUGHT UP A GOOD POINT TELL ITS IT'S- MISTER. PHIL TAKES. I KNOW YOURSELF BUT THE GERMAN TANKS- SEVENTY ONE PROJECTS AT THREE HUNDRED MILLION THAT'S LIKE FOUR MILLION DOLLARS PER PLANNING. WHAT ARE THEY PLANNING I GUESS THEIR VISIT YEAH I THINK. IS THE FEASIBILITY OF IT THAT SHOULD COSTS YOU KNOW TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS TO HIRE A CONSULTANT IT SEEMS LIKE A LOT OF MONEY. TO HIRING PEOPLE ARE GONNA COME BACK AND SAY WE NEED STATE MONEY TO BUILD THIS PROJECT. IF IT'S IF IT'S IF IT'S PLANNING BY. CONSTRUCTION DRAWINGS AND WORKING DRAWINGS AND DESIGN AND THAT THAT'S THAT THAT'S WHAT WE DO FOR PROJECTS BUT THIS IS LIKE. FEASIBILITY PLANNING AND I CAN CURRER WE DON'T WANT TO WASTE ALL THIS MONEY. ON HIRING A BUNCH OF CONSULTANTS FOR PROJECTS. AND NOT REALLY GETTING. MUCH OUT OF BANG FOR THE BUCK IN CONTENT ACTUAL PROJECTS. AND THEN SECONDLY FOR THE CONSTRUCTION. YOU KNOW DO YEAH WE WOULD LOVE TO FIND AS MANY OF THESE PRODUCTS AS WE CAN BUT AS WE SEE HERE. THIS TWENTY ONE PROJECTS AND REQUESTED IS- ONE POINT TWO- BILLION I'M I'M NOT SURE IF THAT'S FOR FULL FUNDING FOR EACH PROJECT AND I GUESS. THAT'S ROUGHLY BY MASS RIGHT YOU KNOW ROUGHLY- FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS PER PROJECT WHICH SOUNDS LIKE SMALLER TYPE PROJECTS AS OPPOSED TO HUNDREDS OF UNITS PROJECTS SO. WE'LL HAVE TO FIGURE THAT OUT TO IS DO WE WANT TO FIND SOME ALL THE WAY- LOOK AT THAT GAP FINANCING AND PROVIDE. SMALLER TYPE AWARDS TO FIND A MORE. MORE ACTUAL PROJECTS. SO WE WILL SORT THAT OUT IN THE COMING MONTHS BUT OVERALL I THINK. YOU KNOW THE BIG PICTURE 100% WE CONCUR WITH YOU AND- MISS COSTS THAT THAT WE THINK THAT IT WOULD BE GREAT FOR THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO GET IN THE BUSINESS OF- PROVIDING MORE STUDENT HOUSING. FOR FOR CALIFORNIANS AND YOU KNOW HELP THEM NAVIGATE THAT THE SYSTEM AND GRADUATING TRANSFER GET THEIR CERTIFICATE AND MOVE ON TO SUCCESS IN OUR TIMELY MATTER AND- AND HAVE LESS- LESS DEBT LESS STRESS ON THEMSELVES SO- THIS IS A CERTAINLY A PRIORITY THIS IS I KNOW YOU SAY IS NEW. TO TO THEIR COMMUNICATIVE AND AS YOU SAID EARLIER WE HAVE LOTS OF DISTRICTS TO THEIR OWN OPINION SO IT'S NOT ALWAYS CENTRALIZED THROUGH THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE SO WE UNDERSTAND THAT AS WELL. SO I THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. QUESTIONS NUMBER QUESTIONS FOR. MR TAKE. THIS ONE JUST ONE QUICK SIMILAR TO SAYING THAT- WE WERE VERY EXCITED TO SEE TWENTY ONE APPLICATIONS COME IN. AND HAVE TWENTY ONE CAMPUSES THAT ARE. INTERESTED IN READY TO GO SO I THINK THAT THAT IN ITSELF IS A CAUSE IS GREAT IN. JUST- ECHO MISS- YOU KNOW MISS KOSTAS STATEMENT. REGARDING PARTNERING WITH EITHER C. S. USER USES WE THINK THAT'S A GREAT IDEA. AS WELL AND WOULD BE HAPPY TO. FIGURE OUT HOW WE. CAN ENCOURAGE THEM TO THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU FOR. OUR NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM WE I KNOW WE HAVE A TIME CONSTRAINT AND HE'S PERSONALLY CHEN ANYWAY SO WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM. OUR CHANCELLOR AT UC SAN DIEGO CHANCELLOR KHOSLA. AND THEN WE HEAR FROM CHANCELLOR LEVY. AND THEN FROM OUR PRESIDENT FROM- CSU FULLERTON VERGY. FURNITURE MCCARTY AND GOOD MORNING MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. AND THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR CONTINUED SUPPORT OF THE U. S. OF CALIFORNIA AND THANK YOU FOR WORKING SO DILIGENTLY TO FIND WHAT I THINK IS MUCH NEEDED STERN HOUSING IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET. I'M VERY PLEASED TO SHARE THAT THIS FOG UC SAN DIEGO OPENED A BRAND NEW LIVING LEARNING COMMUNITY. WELL THE NORTH TORREY PINES LIVING AND LEARNING NEIGHBORHOOD. THIS NEIGHBORHOOD IS HOME TO OUR SIXTH CALL OF THE TWO THOUSAND STUDENT BEDS IN ARTS AND HUMANITIES BUILDING A SOCIAL SCIENCES PUBLIC. BUILDING ABSENT THE PROVIDES CLASSES WORKSHOP AND STUDIO SPACE FOR STUDENTS EMPLOYEES AND THE PUBLIC IN A VARIETY OF MEDIUMS SUGGESTS AROUND X. WOODWORKING THE SURFBOARD SHAPING. YOU ALSO HAVE UNDER CONSTRUCTION THE THEATER DISTRICT AND LEARNING LEARNING NEIGHBORHOOD WHICH WILL ADD ANOTHER TWO THOUSAND UNDERGRADUATE BETS WHEN IT OPENS IN FALL TWO THOUSAND TWENTY THREE. HOWEVER WE ARE VERY ANXIOUS TO BUILD EVEN MORE ALL THE UC SAN DIEGO'S GREATLY APPRECIATIVE OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE'S WORK TO CREATE A GRANT PROGRAM FOR SOME HOUSING. WE BELIEVE A PERMANENT REVOLVING LOAN FUND BUT 0% INTEREST RATE WILL ALLOW THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA TO BUILD MORE ON CAMPUS HOUSING. MAKES LOTS MORE AFFORDABLE AND HELP PRESERVE DEBT CAPACITY OR OTHER CORE MISSION CAPITAL-PROJECTS. LET ME GIVE AN EXAMPLE. BUT EVERY HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS UC SAN DIEGO RECEIVES AT 0% INTEREST RATE AS PART OF THIS PROPOSED REVOLVING LOAN FUND. IT WOULD GENERATE AN ANNUAL DEBT SAVINGS OF TWO POINT ONE MILLION WHICH COULD BE DISTRIBUTED LET'S SAY THE PROXY TWO THOUSAND STUDENTS. TWO THOUSAND OF OUR MEDIA STUDENTS. THIS FUNDING WOULD NOT DISCUSS WHAT BETS BUT IT WOULD ALSO ALLOW US TO REINVEST THE SAVINGS INTO AFFRONT TO PROVIDE UPWARDS OF SEVENTY FIVE MILLION. OR THIRTY FIVE YEAR PERIOD IN HOUSING AID TO ELIGIBLE CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS. UC SAN DIEGO ALREADY OFFERS FROM HOUSING AT 20% BELOW MARKET. BUT IN THIS EXAMPLE WOULD BE ABLE TO OFFER AN ADDITIONAL 18% DISCOUNT TO OUR NEEDIEST STUDENTS AT RATES NEARLY 38% BELOW MARKET. OR IN ADDITIONAL COST SAVINGS OF ABOUT TWO THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY THREE DOLLARS PER STUDENT THREE. THIS SCENARIO WOULD ALSO CREATE HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE CONSTRUCTION JOBS OVER A THREE YEAR PERIOD AND THIRTY NINE PERMANENCE WITH SO THE CUSTODIAL OF RESIDENTIAL PROGRAMMING JOBS. ADDITIONALLY IN TE STATE ALLOWED THE UC SYSTEM OUR CAMPUSES TO MANAGE THE FUNDS COULD BE FURTHER LEVERAGED TO BUILD ADDITIONAL BEDS OR DIFFERENT NATIONALS ON HOUSING. BECAUSE AT THE END OF THIRTY FIVE YEARS YOU WOULD AGAIN HAVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS RECOVERED WE COULD HAVE YOU HAVE. A COLOR DAHLE PRINCIPLE THAT WE COULD INVESTIGATE. SO AS YOU KNOW AND RICH CAMP ON CAMPUS WILL EXPERIENCE IS VITAL TO THE SUCCESS OF OUR STUDENTS. STRESSFUL LIVE ON CAMPUS HAVE MORE TIME TO STUDY. EXPLORE INTERESTS AND CONNECT. IN SPACES SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED FOR LEARNING AND DISCOVERY. THEY HAVE MORE OPPORTUNITIES TO INTERACT WITH FACULTY RESEARCHERS AND COLLEAGUES. THEY'RE MORE FOCUSED AND ACTIVELY ENGAGED WITH THEIR EDUCATION. ENJOY STUDY GROUPS SO LOCALIZATIONS. AND MORE EDUCATIONAL EVENTS AND DEVELOP STRONGERPEER NETWORKS THESE NETWORKS KEEP THEM MOTIVATED IN SCHOOL AND PROMOTE LONG TERM CAREER SUCCESS AFTER GRADUATION. TO IMPROVE THE SLICK BEAR TO IMPROVE THIS ONE EXPERIENCE AND SUCCESS. UC SAN DIEGO IS INTERESTED IN BUILDING SOON HOUSING BECAUSE WE KNOW HOW IMPORTANT AND IMPACTFUL LIVING ON CAMPUSES. WE ALSO KNOW THE IMPORTANCE OF MAKING HOUSING AFFORDABLE AND ACCESSIBLE. UC SAN DIEGO IS LOCATED IN THE BEACH COMMUNITY OF LOCAL AREA AND PROXIMAL OFF CAMPUS RENTALS CAN BE COST PROHIBITIVE OR SINCE. HOUSING MORE CENTRAL CAMPUS AS MANY BENEFICIAL EFFECTS AS I'VE ALREADY MENTIONED. AS SUCH A GOOD FOR ON CAMPUS HOUSING IS TO OFFER BEFORE YOUR HOUSING GUARANTEE TO UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS AT A PRICE THAT IS AT LEAST 20% BELOW MARKET RATES. AND TO ACHIEVE THIS HOUSING GUARANTEE WE EXPECT WE HAVE EXPANDED OUR INVENTORY FROM ABOUT TWELVE THOUSAND BEDS IN 201-321-8000 THAT'S TODAY. WITH A NET INCREASE OF SIX THOUSAND BATS AND WE ANTICIPATE CONSTRUCTING AN ADDITIONAL TEN THOUSAND BEDS IN THE NEXT SEVEN TO TEN YEARS. THIS ALSO ALIGNS WITH THE STATE'S REQUEST DO YOU SEE DO YOU AGREES AND WROTE AND THIS I'M AT THIS UNPRECEDENTED GROWTH REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN INFRASTRUCTURE AND FACILITIES AND IN PARTICULARLY IN SOME HOUSING. SO IN ORDER TO FINANCE A PHONE HOUSING EXPANSION UC SAN DIEGO WHERE THEY SHOULD THIRTY FIVE YEAR BONDS AND TYPICALLY TWO THIRDS OF ASSUMES THAT GOES TO OUR STATE SERVICE I'M SORRY HOUSING PROJECTS. ISSUING A LOAN BONDS INSTEAD OF ENTERING INTO PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS AS ALLOWED UC SAN DIEGO TO KEEP COSTS DOWN BURSTYN'S WATER MIND YOU WE OFFER 20% BELOW MARKET RATES BLOSSOMS. AND HOWEVER WE ARE CLOSE TO GETTING A BED CAPACITY LIMIT WHICH MEANS CAPITAL IS QUICKLY BECOMING THE BIGGEST BARRIER. TO BUILDING MORE SOME HOUSING. UC SAN DIEGO ALSO FOR FUN FROM THE NEW STATE PROGRAM. FOR SALUTE HOUSING NEW HOUSING TO PROJECT CULPEPPER CANYON WEST. THIS NEW DEVELOPMENT HOUSE THIRTEEN HUNDRED TRANSFER UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS WITHIN STEPS THE NEW ON CAMPUS CRAWLEY WHICH COMES ALL THE WAY FROM SENATE SEAT ROW TO OUR CAMPUS. HOWEVER WE BELIEVE AND I STRONGLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO CONSIDER THAT A REVOLVING FUND WITH INTEREST RATES AT 0% WOULD EXPONENTIALLY INCREASE THE STATE'S INVESTMENT IN SOME HOUSING. THIS APPROACH DOES NOT HAVE TO BE APPLIED TO ALL THREE HAVE EDUCATION SEGMENTS IF THE OTHER TO DO NOT FAVORITE. BUT UC CAMPUSES WOULD GREATLY BENEFIT AND BE ABLE TO BUILD SIGNIFICANTLY MORE HOUSING THAN ONE TIME FUNDING KEPT AWAY. AGAIN THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY AND I APPRECIATE AND I APPRECIATE JEFF MCCARTY'S. AND THIS OF COMMITTEES EFFORTS TO FIND CREATIVE SOLUTIONS TO THE CHALLENGES OF BUILDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND CREATING AND AFFORDABLE EDUCATION FOR HIGHLY DESERVING CALIFORNIA SINCE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH EPICNESS ABORTIONS. THANK YOU CHANCELLOR BECAUSE LACK I WANTED TO FOCUS ON THE- REVOLVING FUND ISSUE- YEAH OF COURSE MISTER PRESTON BROUGHT THIS UP AND WE BROUGHT THE BROWN'S PROPOSAL LAST YEAR WHAT WOULD IT MATTER IF THE FIND. WAS UC REVOLVING FIND VERSES EIGHT. LET'S SAY CALIFORNIA REVOLVING FUND. THROUGH LIKE THE TRAGEDY CATCHERS ON US WHAT WHAT WHAT WOULD THAT DO WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE OR DISTINCTION THERE AND HOW IT IS IT'S GOT. SO THE DISTINCTION- JIM MCCARTY FOR US WOULD BE THE FIRST OF ALL IT WOULD NOT MATTER FOR THE FIRST ROUND BUT THE DISTINCTION WHAT BEAT THAT OF THE REVOLVING FUND AFTER THE FIRST ROUND IF IT WERE MANAGED BY YOU SEE. THEN YOU SEE WILL HAVE AGAIN HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO INVEST AFTER WE DON'T COVER THE- PRINCIPAL AMOUNT. IF IT WAS N THE STATE AND THE STATE WOULD HAVE THE MONEY TO INVEST AND THEY COULD DECIDE HOW TO BOOK SO FROM MY PERSPECTIVE. EITHER WAY IT INVOLVING FUND IS A RIGHT ANWER. VARONA YEAH I THINK IT'S JUST SOME LOGISTICS IF WE DID HAVE. THE YOU KNOW THE WILL TO DO IT DO WE DO THREE OR WOULD YOU WANT SO WHAT WE'LL HAVE TO KIND OF SORT THAT OUT BUT I STILL THINK IT'S- THE APPROACH THAT- THAT THAT WE NEED AND- WE HAVE OUR- OUR BUDGET CHAIR HERE LISTENING AND- YEAH I THINK WE'RE GOING TO HAVE PLENTY OF. OPPORTUNITIES WITH ONE TIME MONEY AGAIN THE BUDGET TO LOOK AT CALIFORNIA PRIORITIES AND- AND THIS IS ONE- AND THEN. IT'S MISTY BESIDE THE REVOLVING FUND YOU'RE STILL SAYING TO THAT THAT- ARE YOU KNOW ONE TIME APPROPRIATIONS TO BUY DOWN THE COST OF THE PROJECT IS DESIRED TO YOU OR IS YOUR FOCUS 100% RECALLING FRONT. SOON MIGHT BE YOU THE TW ARE SIMILAR. BUYING DOWN THE CLUSTER PROJECT ONE TIME. DOES NOT- HER SERVICE IT IS IT DOES NOT HAVE A LONG VERY LONG TERM IMPACT IF YOU TAKE THAT ONE TYPE BY DOWN AND JUST GIVE IT TO ME AS A AND LET ME USE IT AS A LOT OF FUN WE WILL CREATE AN IMPACT OF HIS TO THE THREE X. MORE THAN WHAT YOU HAVE TO. ANTICIPATED. YEAH WELL AGAIN ALL CAMPUSES ARE DIFFERENT AND WE'RE WE HAVE LOTS OF OPINIONS HERE TODAY- BUT WE HAVE WE HAVE A FEW A FEW OPTIONS DIFFERENT OPINIONS FROM EACH SYSTEM AS WELL. I THOUGHT WE HAVE QUESTIONS FOR MR CLOSELY MR MEDINA. CHANCER CONSULATE THANK YOU AGAIN YES- FOR HOSTING ME- THIS WEEK- AT UC SAN DIEGO AND THE WORK YOU'VE DONE THERE IS CERTAINLY IMPRESSIVE- ESPECIALLY AS IT RELATES TO STUDENT HOUSING BOTH FOR GRADUATE STUDENTS AND UNDERGRADUATES- I DON'T REMEMBER- THAT WHETHER IT'S THE FIFTH OR SIXTH COLLEGE THAT I VISITED AND HAD LUNCH. BUT SIX COLLEGE ST COLLEGE- WHERE YOU WERE WHERE YOU HAVE BOTH STUDENT HOUSING AND CLASSROOMS. I IF I UNDERSTOOD CORRECTLY ON TOP OF EACH OTHER IS THAT CORRECT IN THE IN IN THE SAME. IN THE SAME BUILDING. YES IT'S AN INTEGRATED LIVING AND LEARNING NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE I'M A STRONG BELIEVER THAT SEGREGATING CLASSROOM SPACES FROM LEARNING FROM- HOUSING SPACES AND FACULTY OFFICE IS A MISTAKE. WELL I WOULD SHARE WITH MY COLLEAGUES THAT THAT WAS CERTAINLY EXCITING AND SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT THAT I'D EVER SEEN BEFORE ON A COLLEGE CAMPUS SO. I APPLAUD YOU FOR THAT VISION. HOW WERE YOU ABLE HOW WERE YOU ABLE TO FINANCE THAT WHERE YOU'RE ABLE TO MIX OUR CLASSROOMS BASE WITH STUDENT HOUSING. SO WHAT WE DO IS- WE FINANCE THE WHOLE PROJECT WHAT WE ALLOCATE THE HOUSING COSTS TO HOUSING AND DINING AND THE CLASSROOM SPACES AND THE ACADEMIC BUILDINGS I HAVE PAID FOR WITH INTERNAL FUNDS- WOULD ONE TANKS- SAVINGS THAT WE HAVE ON OUR CAMPUS- AND DONE SOME LEVEL OF BORING BUT ALL INTERNALS. AND ALSO SOME FUNDRAISING. THANK YOU AND ALSO JUST A TO- YOU KNOW SAYING- TO YOUR STAFF HOW FAR THEY'VE COME FROM MY DAYS OF- GOING DOWN THE CAFETERIA LINE WITH MY LUNCH TRAY BREAKFAST TRAY HOW THINGS HAVE CHANGED. THANK YOU. WE SHOULD HEAR POSITIVE COMMENTS. THANK MISTER TANK. JUST ACROSS THE BAY SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE- CAN YOU GIVE US A SENSE OF WHY YOU'VE BEEN ABLE TO BUILD BY YOU YOU FELT THE MOST HOUSING OF ALL THE- DIFFERENT CAMPUSES AND I DON'T KNOW MAYBE PERHAPS YOU INHERITED THE MOST HOUSING. CAN YOU GIVE US A SENSE OF HOW YOU WERE ABLE TO DO THAT AS AN EXAMPLE FOR PERHAPS SOME OF THE OTHER CAMPUSES OR EVEN ANOTHER SOME OF THE SEGMENTS TO. LEARN AS AN EXAMPLE. HELLO THERE'S NOTHING THERE'S NOTHING ROCKET SCIENCE ABOUT THIS WHEN I GOT HERE. IT WAS CLEAR TO ME THAT WE HAVE THE LAND MASS- IN THAT IF WE WERE GOING O BE IMPACTFUL TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE TO GROW AND NOT COULD NOT BE JUST IN A LEAD- EXECUTION. UP AND AT THAT POINT TO A STRATEGIC PLANNING PROCESS BEFORE MULDER DIVISION FOUR FOUR YEAR HOUSING GUARANTEE. FOR UNDERGRADUATES AND PHCS WAS UP 20% BELOW MARKET. AND THE BELOW MARKET WAS BECAUSE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THE FEDS WERE GENEROUS ENOUGH TO GIVE US LAND FOR FREE. AND TYPICALLY HOUSING PROJECTS THE COST OF THE AND IT'S 2230% AND I WANTED TO GIVE IT BACK. TO THE CITIZENS OF CALIFORNIA. GREAT THANK YOU IT'S BEEN DONE- SO THE BIGGEST YOU MENTIONED YOU HAVE A LAND MASS OF. SO ONE OF THE CONSTRAINTS IS DEFINITELY ACCESS TO LANCE OF OTHER. CAMPUSES WERE SAY MORE LAND CONSTRAINED THAT WOULD BE A CHALLENGE BUT IF THEY DIDN'T. HAVE THAT CONSTRUED TO SHOULD BE ABLE TO. FIGURE OUT A WAY TO CONSTRUCT ON MORE HOUSING. YEAH THAT'S ANOTHER POSSIBLE AND FOR US- THIS LIGHT RAIL. CREATES ANOTHER AMPLIFICATION BECAUSE I CAN IMAGINE- BUT ALONG THE LIGHT RAIL. WE COULD START- BUILDING SOON HOUSING. NOT ONLY DEVELOPED COMMUNITIES ALONG THE AROUND THE LIGHT RAIL STATIONS BUT ALSO CREATE ACCESS TO OUR CAMPUS AND PRESERVE THE LAND MASS HERE FOR ACADEMIC PROGRAMMING. THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY IN THAT MOST IMPORTANTLY CUTS CANCER BECAUSE THAT I TELL YOU THIS PRIOR BELIEVE I'LL TELL YOU PUBLICLY I THINK YOU'RE DOING A FABULOUS JOB DOWN THERE THAT YOU SEE SAN DIEGO- IN DOING AN AMAZING JOB TO EXPAND STUDENT HOUSING THERE I KNOW IT'S DIFFERENT THEY'RE NOT A LOT OF. AVAILABLE HOUSING IN LA HOYA THAT'S AFFORDABLE FOR STUDENTS AND SO YOU REALLY NEED TO BUILD IT ON CAMPUS IT IS AND NOW HOUSING AT ALL AND AS MR TANG SAID- NIGHT AND DAY BETWEEN THE LAND YOU HAVE THERE FOR EXAMPLE BURGHCLERE LA YOU KNOW THE OTHER CAMPUSES THAT THAT HAVE THAT ARE THE MOST SELECTIVE AT THE UC SEGMENT BUT- YOUR ENTREPRENEURIAL SPIRIT THERE AND FINDING WAYS TO BUILD STUDENT HOUSING IS NOTED AND- I WOULD LIKE TO REPLICATE WHAT YOU DO AT SOME RATHER- CAMPUSES SO THANK YOU FOR BEING A GREAT EXAMPLE. THANK YOU TO EVERYBODY COULD NOT DO THIS WITHOUT THE STUFF ESTO SUPPORT OF THE STATE THANK YOU ARE LIKELY TO SHIP. OKAY THANK YOU WILL NOW GO TO OUR CHANCELLOR AT UC SANTA CRUZ. AND I I'M NOT SURE IF I PRONOUNCE IT BECAUSE OF THE REEF. IT'S LEAVES. ACTING TEACHER MCCARTY YES GOOD TO SEE HELLO I WAS JUST DOWN THERE A FEW- MONTHS AGO TALKING ABOUT HOUSING SO IT'S GOOD TO HAVE YOU TODAY WITH- OUR COMMITTEE. AND YOU KNOW YOU DO HAVE A LAND- SHORTAGE THERE AS FAR AS YOUR CAMPUS AND CAN SCAN ENVIRONMENTAL CONSTRAINTS SO HAVING YOUR PERSPECTIVE IS VERY HELPFUL SO PLEASE PROCEED. WELL THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME TODAY WE DON'T HAVE. I'M A LAND SHORTAGE AT UC SANTA CRUZ BUT WE DO HAVE MENTAL CONSTRAINTS THAT I'M PLEDGE IT. AND THAT'S TOPIC IS JUST SO IMPORTANT TO ME. AND IT'S ONE I'VE ACUTELY. FAMILIAR WITH SINCE BECOMING CHANCELLOR AT UC SANTA CRUZ AND JULY TWENTY NINETEEN. ECHOED THE SERIOUS CONCERNS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN RAISED ABOUT THE ISSUE TODAY AND ALSO REINFORCED THAT STUDENT SUCCESS. IT'S RESULT FROM PROVIDING CAMPUS HOUSING FOR STUDENTS WE SEE THAT IN MANY WAYS. I KNOW YOU UNDERSTAND THE CRITICAL NEED FOR MORE HOUSING AND THE HIGH COST OF WHAT'S CURRENTLY AVAILABLE ESPECIALLY IN COASTAL AREAS WHERE HOUSING COSTS ARE AN INCREDIBLE BURDEN FOR SO MANY PEOPLE. OUR STUDENTS FACULTY AND STAFF ARE AMONG. IN A RECENT STUDY 70% OF SANTA CRUZ COUNTY RENTERS REPORT BEING SPENT BURDEN WHICH IS DEFINED AS SOMEONE WHO PAYS MORE THAN 30% OF THEIR INCOME ON RENT. BUT IT IS NOT ONLY A MATTER OF COST HERE THERE IS VERY LIMITED HOUSING STOCK AVAILABLE FOR RENT OR FOR SALE IN SANTA CRUZ COUNTY AT ANY PRICE. AND THIS PROBLEM HAS BEEN EXACERBATED BY THE LOSS OF NEARLY A THOUSAND HOMES IN OUR COUNTY IN THE TWENTY TWENTY SEIZE THE WILDFIRE. THE UC SANTA CRUZ CURRENTLY HOUSES MORE THAN 50% OF OUR STUDENTS THAT'S ONE OF THE HIGHEST PERCENTAGES IN THE UC AND CSU SYSTEMS AND- WE'RE MOVING DIRT RIGHT NOW ON A PROJECT THAT WILL ADD NEARLY TWENTY TWO HUNDRED BETS. AT ONE OF OUR TEN RESIDENTIAL COLLEGE. WE HAVE APPLIED FOR A SATE GRANT FUNDS THAT WOULD HELP WITH ADD HUNDREDS MORE. RECENTLY THE BOARD OF REGENTS APPROVED UC SANTA CRUZ'S LONG RANGE DEVELOPMENT PLAN L. R. D. P. ITS OWN LAND USE DOCUMENT THAT OUTLINES HOW AND WHERE ARE CAMPUS MICRO AND ACCOMMODATE STUDENTS OVER THE NEXT TWENTY YEARS. SO AS YOU PREVIOUSLY HEARD IS THE SENATE GROUPS COMMITTED AS PART OF THAT PLAN TO HOUSE A 100% OF OUR ANTICIPATED GROWTH IN RESIDENTIAL STUDENTS. AS WE HAVE THE NECESSARY CAMPUS LAND TO ALLOW THAT DEVELOP IN THERE SO LITTLE HOUSING AVAILABLE IN THE COMMUNITY. THIS DECISION IS NOT MEANT IN ANY WAY TO CAP ENROLLMENT GROW BUT TO FACILITATE ENROLLMENT GROWTH UP TO TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND STUDENTS. TO SUPPORT THE STATE'S ENROLLMENT GOALS. IT'S ALSO MEANT TO REDUCE THE CONSTRAINTS THAT WOULD LIKELY ARISE THROUGH SETTLEMENT OF LAWSUITS AS OCCURRED IN THIS MOMENT OF LITIGATION ASSOCIATED WITH OUR TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE HELLO KITTY. ONE AREA THAT WE ALSO NEED THE STATE'S HELP WITH GETTING FINANCING AND I AGREE WITH EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT GROSS GRAMMOND CHANCELLOR KHOSLA. THE PROVIDING ACCESS TO MORE CAPITAL MY STAB US IN A LOT REVOLVING LOAN FUND WOULD BE HELPFUL HOUSING ON OUR CAMPUS AND THAT THE UC SAYS FINANCED LARGELY THROUGH STUDENT RANSOM. WELL THIS MODEL WAS SUFFICIENT IN THE PAST THE CURRENT NEED OUT CASES OROVILLE BIT MAIL ABILITY TO FINANCE LARGE PROJECTS ON THE TIME FRAME WE NEED THEM. ALLOWING YOU SEE TO UTILIZE STATE CAPITOL CREATIVELY WOULD SERVE ALL OF OUR CAMPUSES AND STUDENTS. EXTERNAL FORCES THAT HINDER DEVELOPMENT ON OUR CAMPUSES ARE ALSO OCCURRING AT THAT IS THAT WE FACE AS WE ATTEMPT TO ADDRESS THE NEED FOR STUDENT HOUSING. UC SANTA CRUZ SPENT NEARLY FIVE YEARS OF PLANNING CONDUCTING ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSES WORKING WITH STAKEHOLDERS AND SEEKING APPROVAL FOR I WOULD APPROXIMATELY THREE THOUSAND BED PROJECT CALLED STUDENT HOUSING WEST. THIS PROJECT WILL ALSO ADVANCE OUR LONG STANDING COMMITMENT TO SUSTAINABILITY INCLUDES SOLAR PHOTOVOLTAICS TO GENERATE ELECTRICITY AND SOLAR THERMAL TO PROVIDE HOT WATER AS WELL AS A WATER RECYCLING FACILITY THAT WILL ALLOW THE CAMPUS TO RE USE WASTE WATER FOR NON POTABLE USES LIKE FLUSHING TOILETS TOILETS AND IRRIGATION. SO THIS STUDENT HOUSING WEST PROJECT WAS APPROVED TWO AND A HALF YEARS AGO BY OUR REGIONS. BUT LAWSUITS HAVE FAULTED IT IN ITS TRACKS THE ORIGINAL PLAN PROJECTED THAT WE WOULD HAVE ALREADY COMPLETED THE FAMILY STUDENT HOUSING PORTION OF THE PROJECT. AND AN ADJACENT CHILD CARE CENTER BUT ONGOING LITIGATION MEANS WE HAVE YET TO PUT A SHOVEL IN THE GROUND. SANTA CRUZ COUNTY JUDGE IN OCTOBER TWENTY TWENTY APPELLE SEES DETAILED ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW OF STUDENT HOUSING WEST. THE PROJECT UNDERWENT A THOROUGH ANALYSIS UNDER SCORING THE CAMPUS IS COMMITMENT TO THE ENVIRONMENT. THE JUDGE DIDN'T FIND ANY ISSUES WITH THAT YEAH I ARE. BUT DID IDENTIFY SOME FOR FREE PROCEDURAL ISSUES WITH THE RICH GENTLE APPROVAL. THIS PROCEDURAL MATTER HAS SINCE BEEN CORRECTED. BUT OPPONENTS CONTINUE TO CHALLENGE THE PROJECT IN COURT. DELAYS THAT SIGNIFICANTLY ADD EXPENSES TO THE PROJECT. UC SANTA CRUZ HAS BEEN A CHAMPION FOR ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP AND JUSTICE CENTS ARE FOUND. AND I BELIEVE THE ENVIRONMENTAL AT THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT SEQUEL IS ESSENTIAL FOR ENSURING THAT PROJECTS AND DEVELOPMENTS ARE ENVIRONMENTALLY SUSTAINABLE AND DON'T POSE A THREAT TO THE ENVIRONMENT. SIX HAS BEEN IN THE FIFTY YEARS SINCE SAID THAT ITS ENACTMENT A FORCE FOR GOOD IN CALIFORNIA AND MAINTAINING ITS INTEGRITY AND EFFECTIVENESS IS IMPORTANT. THE PUBLIC'S ABILITY TO CHALLENGE AN ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW OF FORMED BY A PUBLIC AGENCY IS ESSENTIAL TO WAS EFFECTIVENESS. BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT SEQUEL COULDN'T BE IMPROVED. IN MY EXPERIENCE SEEK BUT CAN BE USED BY OPPONENTS TO SERIOUSLY DELAY OTHERWISE GOOD NEEDED AND IMPORTANTLY ENVIRONMENT LEASE PROJECTS LIKE OUR STUDENT HOUSING WEST PROJECT. THIS ULTIMATELY RAISES PROJECT COSTS AND INHIBITS OUR EFFORTS TO PROVIDE MORE VITALLY NEEDED STUDENT HOUSING. THE IMPACTS OUR ABILITY TO HELP BOTH OUR STUDENTS. AND THE COMMUNITIES WITH WHOM WE PARTNER SANTA CRUZ IT HAS A HOUSING PRICES NOT JUST FOR OUR STUDENTS BUT FOR ALL OF ITS RESIDENTS. SO WE NEED A BETTER MORE TIMELY MORE TRANSPARENT PROCESS THAT WILL ENSURE BOTH ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND IN PORTABLE HOUSING FOR CALIFORNIA STUDENTS. THESE ARE NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE GOALS WE CAN HAVE BOTH IF WE ACT TOGETHER TO CAREFULLY. AND THOUGHTFULLY REFINED THE PROCESS. SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME CONSIDERATION FOR YOUR INTEREST IN THIS PROJECT IN SUPPORT OUT OF EDUCATION CALIFORNIA SO I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU CHANCELLOR IT AND HIDE I KNOW SEEK WAS THAT IT TOUGH ISSUE TO ADDRESS AND OUR FORMER GOVERNOR. GOVERNOR BROWN I THINK CALLED IT GOD'S WORK OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT BECAUSE- IT'S VERY LUCIFER- IT'S THAT THAT BEING SAID SOME OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK ARE IN OUR MORE OF OUR- YEAH IMMEDIATE CONTROL HERE FOR THE SPECIALLY WITH THIS. SUBCOMMITTEE IS THE FINANCIAL PIECE SO YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE- REVOLVING FUND ISSUE. THAT CHANCE R. COSTA TALKED ABOUT. AN INDOOR THE ISSUE OF. NO ONE TYPE STATE MONEY TO BUY DOWN THE PROJECTS WHAT WHICH IS WHICH IS THE ISSUE THAT WOULD BE MORE HELPFUL. TO YOU TO PRODUCE MORE STUDENT HOUSING. FROM IT. SO YOU YES THANK YOU SO I CAN SEE A PLACE FOR BOTH SO ABOUT THE GAP FUNDING OUT WE HAVE ALSO APPLIED FOR THE STATE GRANT PROGRAM AND THAT WOULD BE A HELP FOR US PROVIDING THOSE BEDS AS PART OF OUR CRESPI RENEWAL CHECK OUT OUT OF. THE QUICKTIME L. ESTABLISHMENT THOUGH ABOUT ABOUT REVOLVING FUND THAT'S WRITTEN INTEREST WOULD BE A REAL LONG TERM NGUYEN I THANK FOR STUDENT HOUSING IT WOULD ALLOW US NOT ONLY TO HAVE READY ACCESS TO THAT CAPITAL BUT ALSO TO PASS ALONG THE COSTS TO STUDENTS. LIKE CHANCELLOR KHOSLA DESCRIBED WE PROVIDE HOUSING ON OUR CAMPUS BELOW MARKET RATES AND THE ABILITY TO REDUCE THE TO PASS ALONG THOSE. COSTS TO OUR NEEDIEST STUDENTS. A THANK YOU QUESTION FOR CHANCELLOR MISTER TAKE. THANK YOU FOR OUTLINING THE CHALLENGES YOU'RE FACING GOING THROUGH ON THE SPIRIT THE PARTICULAR STUDENT HOUSING PROJECT ON YOUR CAMPUS SANTA BARBARA BERKELEY FACE SOME OF THE TOUGHEST. AND COMMUNICATION- CONSISTED COMMITTEE ON THIS ROAD HOUSING OR DEVELOPMENT KID CAN YOU HELP US UNDERSTAND OR WHAT WHAT WE WHAT HOW WE COULD HELP YOUR JOB TAKE YOUR CAMPUS IN PARTICULAR ALSO OTHER CAMPUSES ARE IN. VERY IMPACTED AREAS BUT ALSO IN IN AREAS WHERE THE COMMUNITIES GENERALLY ARE POSING ANY KIND OF DEVELOPMENT. WELL SO I ONE OF THE REASONS THAT THAT WE AS PART OF OUR LONG RANGE DEVELOPMENT PLAN OUT HAD PROMISED A HOUSE A 100% OF OUR NEW ENROLLMENT. IT'S TO HELP MITIGATE THAT THE CONCERNS OF OUR CITY AND COUNTY ABOUT THE IMPACTS O STUDENTS. ARE ALREADY TIGHT HOUSING MARKET. AND SO I THINK THAT THAT IS THAT YOU KNOW THAT IS OURS ONE OF OUR STRATEGIES UP I I'M NOT. A LAWYER AND SO I THINK THAT IF WE WANTED TO TALK ABOUT SECRET STRATEGIES IT BETTER TO HAVE THE LEGISLATOR CHAIR AND THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT WORK TOGETHER. TO DEVISE SOME POLICY STRATEGY THAT COULD BALANCE THE GOALS FOR. PROJECTIONS AND STUDENT HOUSING. I THINK THAT IN TERMS OF OUR CAMP. AND IN OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE CITY AND THE COUNTY DOES DOES NOT HAVE HAVE GREATLY IMPROVED I THINK OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS. OF MANY OF OUR CITY AND COUNTY ELECTED OFFICIALS ARE SUPPORTIVE OF BUILDING MORE CAMPUS HOUSING BECAUSE THAT WILL REDUCE OF THE DEMANDS ON THE COMMUNITY. BUT THERE WILL BE THOSE WHO WILL FILE LEGAL CHALLENGES ROUTE REALLY REGARDLESS OF THE PROJECT I THINK REGARDLESS OF THE BENEFITS TO THE COMMUNITY SO. THAT'S PART OF THE CHALLENGE THAT THAT WE FACE IN SANTA CRUZ. IN SUCH AS RESULT A COME COLLEAGUE- MISTER DONALD- BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO ENTER INTO AN AGREEMENT TO BUILD HOUSING FOR. INCREASED ENROLLMENT BECAUSE- BASICALLY YOU'VE BEEN UNABLE TO BUILD HOUSING DOES THAT IN ESSENCE A FORCE YOU TO CAP YOUR ENROLLMENT BECAUSE OF YOUR INABILITY TO BUILD. HOUSING DUE TO LOCAL COMMUNITIES ISSUE. H. NO I DON'T THINK SO I THINK THAT- IT'S DELAYS OUR ABILITY PALESTINIANS SO WHAT WHAT WE HAVE NOW IS IN OUR CREST PROJECT WE'RE ADDING SEVERAL HUNDRED BELTS AS PART OF THE- REVISION. THIS BIG PROJECT OUT STUDENT HOUSING WEST I'M I THINK WE'RE EVENTUALLY GOING TO GET TO BUILD IT AYE I DO WORRY ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT WE'LL BE ABLE TO AFFORD IT. ONCE IT FINALLY CLEARS THE LEGAL HURDLES IT HIGHLIGHTS FOR ME THE NEED FOR OUR USES ACTORS TO ALWAYS HAVE HOUSING PROJECTS IN DEVELOPMENT. IF WE ANTICIPATE THAT THAT TIMELINE IS THE LENGTH OF THE PIE I DELAYS DUE TO LITIGATION. IT MEANS THAT WE SHOULD ALWAYS HAVE US SOME PROJECT IN DEVELOPMENT SO THAT THAT THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DELIVER BAD IN A TIMELY WAY. WANT TO DIMINISH AT IN OUR TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE LONG RANGE DEVELOPMENT PLAN. WE DID RECEIVE A NUMBER OF LEGAL CHALLENGES TO THAT PLANT. INCLUDING FROM OUR COMMUNITY GOVERNMENT AND AS PART OF THE THAT COMPREHENSIVE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT THAT RISK. THAT LITIGATION THE CAMPUS HAD SIMILAR- DEMANDS A DEBT THAT WE MET. FOR A GROWING HOUSING AS WE GREW ENROLLMENT BUT ALSO THE ENROLLMENT OUT TARGET CAP FOR THE LONG RANGE DEVELOPMENT PLAN WAS REDUCED AS PART OF THE APPLICATION. AND SO THAT'S ONE THING THAT WE'RE HOPING TO AVOID OUT THROUGH THIS HOUSING- COMMITMENT. TO HOUSE A 100% OF STUDENTS IS. A GROWING TO TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND STUDENTS WOULD BE MEAN ADDING. NINE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED STUDENTS MORE THAN NINETEEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED. AND TO OUR TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE LONG RANGE DEVELOPMENT PLAN. BECAUSE WE- ARE REALLY COMMITTED TO ACCESS FOR CALIFORNIA STUDENTS ON OUR CAMPUS. THAT WOULD BE A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS THAT WE'RE ABLE TO. ACCOMMODATE. ON OUR CAMPUSES RESIDENTIAL. THE OTHER HALF OF I JUST HAVE BE ON IS I CAN'T I DON'T I CAN REALLY GROW ENROLLMENT WITHOUT HOUSING. WHERE WOULD THOSE STUDENTS LIVE WE CAN'T BRING STUDENTS TO SANTA CRUZ. AND THEN AND THEN NOT HAVE A PLACE FOR THEM TO STAY. THANK YOU CHRISTIAN OKAY THANK YOU MR MEHTA. OKAY NO NO NO MORE QUESTIONS THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY OKAY LAST BUT NOT LEAST WE'LL HEAR FROM A REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE CSU SYSTEM ON THE GROUND PERSPECTIVE WE HAVE PRESIDENT FOR J. THANK YOU. SO MUCH FOR YOUR PATIENCE. WELL SAY THE BEST FOR LAST NIGHT YET AND I RUIN YOUR LAST NAME SO TELL ME HOW YOU PRONOUNCE IT AGAIN. BURJI VERGY VIRGIN HOTELS CLUB GET THANK YOU FOR YOUR RESIDENTS YES. WELL THANK YOU TERRY MCCARTY AND MEMBERS OF-THE COMMITTEE FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF CAL STATE FULLERTON WHICH IS BY THE WAY THE MOST POPULATED UNIVERSITY IN THE LARGEST SYSTEM OF HIGHER EDUCATION IN THE COUNTRY AND THE LARGEST UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAMS. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO WE ARE A UNIQUELY SITUATED THAT WAY ALLEN'S PRESIDENT OF THE INSTITUTION THAT SERVES MORE PELL ELIGIBLE STUDENTS THAN THAN PRETTY MUCH THE ENTIRE IDEALLY COMBINED AND MORE FIRST GENERATION STUDENTS THAN ANY pAM ALWAYS EXCITED AND HONORED TO SPEAK ABOUT CAPACITY ISSUES AFFORDABILITY ISSUES ACCESS. ISSUES AND ISSUES OF STUDENT SUCCESS. ALL THE HIGHER EDUCATION STUDENT HOUSING GRANT PROGRAM THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IT'S A POTENTIAL GAME CHANGER. AND MUCH A MUCH OVERDUE INVESTMENTS SINCE THE STATE HAS NEVER REALLY INVESTED DIRECTLY IN STUDENT HOUSING BEFORE. IN DEVELOPING OUR CAL STATE FORTUNE PHYSICAL MASTER PLAN- WHICH WAS UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED BY THAT- CSU BOARD OF TRUSTEES LAST SUMMER WE RECOGNIZE THE DATA THAT PROVIDES THAT A STUDENT RETENTION AND SUCCESS IS DIRECTLY CORRELATED TO HOW MUCH TIME STUDENTS SPEND ON CAMPUS. AT PARTICULARLY FIRST YEAR STUDENTS YOU'RE A CAL STATE FULLERTON WITH OVER FORTY ONE THOUSAND STUDENTS MORE THAN HALF OF WHOM ARE FIRST GENERATION. AND ONLY ABOUT NINETEEN HUNDRED EIGHTY BEDS- THE. IS NOT JUST IN THE ARCHITECTURAL BLUEPRINTS IT'S ALSO IN THE PROGRAMMING. THE COMMUNITY BUILDING THAT HAS TO UNFOLD IN THE SPACE IN WHICH THE DORMS ARE LOCATED. THAT YOU REQUIRES RESOURCES AND LIKE THE BRICK AND MORTAR THE DATA TELLS US THAT IT IS MONEY EXTREMELY WELL SPENT BECAUSE THE RETURN IS ONCE AGAIN HIGHER PERSISTENCE AND GRADUATION RATES AND LOWER EQUITY GAPS AND THAT IS OUR GOAL- WITH ALL THIS IN MIND- A CENTRAL PART OF CASTING FORTUNES MASTER PLAN. IS TO BUILD WHAT I CALL A TWENTY FOUR HOUR CAMPUS COMMUNITY NO LONGER DO WE WANT TO BE KNOWN AS A COMPUTER COMMUTER CAMPUS BUT A CAMPUS COMMUNITY. IN ORDER TO DO THAT THOUGH WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO INVEST IN MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR STUDENTS AND THE KEY WORD THERE IS AFFORDABLE LET'S BE CLEAR HERE ORANGE COUNTY IS NOT AND AFFORDABLE AREA TO LIVE FOR OUR STUDENTS WITH THE COST TO RENT A TYPICAL TWO BEDROOM APARTMENT BEING MORE THAN THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH NOT INCLUDING UTILITIES. I'M AYE OUR STUDENTS ARE FACING ONE OF THE HIGHEST RENTAL RATE MARKETS OF ANY SERVICE REGION IN THE SYSTEM. AT THE SAME TIME WE'RE NUMBER THREE IN THE NATION FOR GRADUATING STUDENTS FROM POOR HISTORICALLY UNDERREPRESENTED COMMUNITIES AND WE HAVE MORE THAN A THOUSAND STUDENTS ON A WAITING LIST TO GET INTO OUR STUDENT HOUSING SO THE NEED FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR OUR STUDENTS IT'S REAL ON OUR CAMPUS AND IT'S STARK. ABOUT HIS HOUSE PROGRAM ALSO HAVE TO BE ELF SUPPORTING AS HAS BEEN TALKED ABOUT OVER AND OVER AGAIN. HE COST OF BUILDING AND OPERATING THEM HAS TO BE COVERED WITH THE FUNDS THAT ARE GENERATED WE DON'T HAVE A SEPARATE ONGOING FUNDING SOURCE. TO SUBSIDIZE OUR HOUSING SO I CAL STATE FULLERTON WE CURRENTLY HAVE TWO HOUSING PROJECTS IN PROGRESS. ONE OF THOSE HOUSING CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS IS OUR PHASE FOUR PROJECT WHICH IS AMENDMENT MCCARTY YES MA'AM MCCARTY HAS SEEN. AND IS CURRENTLY IN THE CONSTRUCTION STAGE OF YOU DRIVE BY THE FIFTY SEVEN FREEWAY YOU SEE IT RISING. I'M IS MORE THAN HALF CONSTRUCTED IT'LL BE COMPLETED IN- AN ONLINE READY FOR STUDENTS IN JUST ABOUT TEN MONTHS IN AUGUST TWENTY TWO. AND IT'LL ADD SIX HUNDRED BEDS- TO OUR CAMPUS. THAT'S THE GOOD NEWS BUT ONCE THAT PROJECT IS COMPLETED THE CAMPUS WHAT WILL BEGIN TO PHASE FIVE PROJECT. WHICH WILL INCLUDE DEMOLISHING THREE OUTDATED HOUSING BUILDINGS THAT WERE BUILT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY AND WHICH CURRENTLY HOW STUDENTS THAT HAVE- IN IN INTO THE FACILITIES THAT HAVE EXCEEDED THEIR USEFUL LIFE AND- WILL SOON FRANKLY BE UNINHABITABLE DUE TO FIRE LIFE SAFETY CODES ADA ISSUES AND ALL FAILING UTILITY LINES. BY A BY THE WAY AS A SIDE NOTE THIS UNDERSCORES WHAT WAS TALKED ABOUT EARLIER THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING THE FUNDS NOT ONLY TO CONSTRUCT NEW HOUSING BUT A DRESS DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BEFORE IT BECOMES SORT OF BIRD. WHICH IS WHAT WE HAVE NOW THAT IT'S CHEAPER TO KNOCK THE BUILDING DOWN AND START OVER- THE ELIMINATION OF THESE BUILDINGS WELL A RACE ABOUT THREE HUNDRED NINETY FIVE BEDS LEADING US. AFTER THE FIRST PROJECT DONE WITH ONLY TO LEARN FIVE BEDS UNTIL WE COMPLETE PHASE FIVE. AS I SAID BECAUSE HOUSING IS SELF SUPPORTING THAT THAT MEANS THAT THEY HAVE TO PAY FOR THEMSELVES IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT ANYTIME A CAMPUS HAS TO ELIMINATE BANDS SUCH AS THE ACTION THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE. THAT IMPACTS REVENUE FOR HOUSING FOR OUR SELF SUPPORT AND THAT'S RATHER DO THAT. ULTIMATELY GOES DIRECTLY TOWARDS SUPPORTING FUTURE HOUSING PROJECTS. SO WITHOUT ANY HELP TO OFFSET THIS LOSS OF REVENUE WE HAVE LESS RESOURCES TO PUT TOWARD SUPPORTING FUTURE HOUSING PROJECTS. THAT'S WHY THE STUDENT HOUSING GRANT PROGRAM THAT YOU ARE ARE- HAVING THIS HEARING ABOUT HERE IS SO CRITICAL IN MEETING THE HOUSING NEEDS OF OUR STUDENTS WITHOUT THIS PROGRAM. THE IMPACT THAT OUR CURRENT AND FUTURE DEBT SERVICE WILL BE SIGNIFICANT AND IT WILL MAKE IT VERY DIFFICULT TO PURSUE OUR HOUSING GOALS AND STILL PROVIDE AFFORDABLE HOUSING TO OUR STUDENTS. I'M AS YOU HEARD IN THIS ISN'T AN ISSUE OF THAT CAPACITY BUT AN ISSUE OF MAKING THESE PROJECTS PENCIL OUT AT THE ND OF THE TO HOUSING CONSTRUCTION PHASES. WILL HAVE TWENTY EIGHT HUNDRED BEDS ON CAMPUS. VERSUS THE NINETEEN HUNDRED BEDS WE HAVE CURRENTLY. pPLAN IS TO INCREASE STUDENT HOUSING TO APPROXIMATELY FIVE THOUSAND BEDS. AND AT LEAST ONE OF THEM IS FUNDED THROUGH THE STUDENT HOUSING GRANT PROGRAM- OR THROUGH A REVOLVING- CREDIT PROGRAM OR SOMETHING. THAT READ WE WILL ALLOW US TO REDUCE- THE COST OF THESE BEDS THAT WILL SIGNIFICANTLY IN IT INCREASE THE AFFORDABILITY- BY ALLOWING US TO NOT WE OFFER BELOW MARKET HOUSING NOW BUT MAKE IT. EVEN FARTHER BELOW MARKET MAY MAKE IT MORE AVAILABLE TO OUR STUDENTS FROM UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. CAL STATE FULLERTON HAS SUBMITTED BOTH OF THESE PROJECTS FOR FUNDING CONSIDERATION TO THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE AND IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING TO PHASE FIVE PROJECT WILL SOON BE SUBMITTED TO THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE FOR FURTHER CONSIDERATION- GRANT FUNDS FOR THESE PROJECTS WILL HELP US NOT ONLY EXPAND CAPACITY WHICH IS REALLY IMPORTANT. WE NEED TO EXPAND CAPACITY HOUSING BUT ALSO PROVIDE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. TO UNDER REPRESENTED- STUDENTS FROM OUR LOW INCOME. AS THE LEGISLATURE IN THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE WELL- WORK ON SOLVING THESE ISSUES THERE'S ANOTHER CONTEXT TO WHICH- THE CONSIDERATIONS YOU HAVE TO BE VIEWED AND THAT'S THE SIZE AND SCOPE OF EACH RESPECTIVE CAMPUS THIS WAS TOUCHED ON AS WELL FOR EXAMPLE FOR A SMALL CAMPUS WITH THREE OR FOUR THOUSAND STUDENTS ARE SIX HUNDRED BAD ADDITION IS GOING TO BE TRANSFORMATIONAL IT WOULD AMOUNT TO ABOUT 20% INCREASE IN IN- HOUSING BUT ON OUR CAMPUS SIX HUNDRED THAT INCREASES. FOR HOUSING OPERATIONS THEY THAT ACCOUNTS FOR ABOUT 2% OF OUR FORTY ONE THOUSAND STUDENTS NEARLY HALF OF THEM ARE LOW INCOME SO AS WE WORK TO MEET INCREASING DEMANDS TO ADMIT EVEN MORE HIGH ACHIEVING LOW INCOME STUDENTS THAT WILL BE THE FUTURE OF OUR WORKFORCE OUR NEED FOR PROGRAMS SUCH AS THIS THE HIGHER EDUCATION STATE HOUSING GRANT PROGRAM THEY'RE ONLY GONNA GROW. AND SO I A LOT HAS BEEN SAID YOU'VE BEEN SITTING TO A LOT OF HEARING I THANK YOU ARE CHAIRMAN MCCARTY AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR PROVIDING ME OPPORTUNITY GIVE A BROAD OUTLINE OF WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE CAL STATE FULLERTON AND IN THE CSU- I COULD TALK ABOUT THIS AT LENGTH BUT I WANT TO BE SURE TO BE RESPECTFUL OF YOUR TIME AND ALSO. BE ABLE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE. YES THANK YOU I DO HAVE- SOME QUESTIONS FOR YOU AND WE HEAR YOU LOUD AND CLEAR ON ON YOUR REQUESTS FOR RESOURCES IT'S VERY- IN LINE WITH WHAT WE HEARD FROM A PRIOR SPEAKERS AS WELL AS THE- THAT THE SEGMENTS AND SO WORK WE'RE GONNA RECAP THAT DISCUSSION IN TWENTY. TWENTY TWO I WANTED TO ASK- YOU KNOW. THAT MISTER MARTIN I SPOKE A FEW MONTHS AGO TO ARE SICK TO YOUR COUNTERPART HERE AT SAC STATE. AND THEIR THEIRSYSTEM THEIR CAMPUSES LET'S SAY IT'S THIRTY THOUSAND STUDENTS RIGHT OR RIGHT AROUND THERE. THEY SAID THEY HAVE I THINK IN HERE IT SAYS THEY HAVE LIKE. TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED OR SOMETHING- THAT HOUSING BEDS ON CAMPUS THREE THREE THOUSAND. AND THEN THERE'S ABOUT SEVEN THOUSAND THAT WERE BUILT. ADJACENT TO THE CAMPUS BY THESE PRIVATE DEVELOPERS- WHICH ARE GOOD AND BAD THERE WAS A REPORT THAT MR TANG GROUP JUST RECENTLY. PASSED SIX SHARED WITH SOME OF THESE OPERATORS AND CAMPUSES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. ARE LIVING UP TO THEIR YOU KNOW TO THEIR BEST TO SERVE STUDENTS AND YOU KNOW THERE. MANY TIMES THESE FOR PROFIT ALL OTHER IF THEY ARE FOR PROP THE MANY TIMES IN THEIR- OWN BY THESE. MAJOR REITS WHO ARE FOCUSED ON OUR Y. AND TAKING CARE THEIR SHAREHOLDERS. SO THOSE DO SERVE. A ROLE IN IN STUDENT HOUSING IN SOMEBODY'S AREAS. THAT THE CHARTS ARE AFFORDABILITY. SOME OF THEIR SON THEY'RE MORE EXPENSIVE MOST LIKELY MORE EXPENSIVE ON CAMPUS BUT ACTUALLY IN SOME OF THE CAMPUS IT SAYS HERE. THAT ARE A LITTLE BIT LESS EXPENSIVE. SO TO QUESTIONS- ARE YOU SAYING MANY OF. THAT MUCH OF THAT IN AROUND. I KNOW OWES A LOT. RIGHT AROUND HERE IT'S- YEAH THERE A LOT OF THAT AROUND FOR TEN AND IN YOUR PRIOR. AS THE GENERAL COUNSEL FOR CSU. DO YOU SEE IT YES IS THAT A TREND THAT WE SEE AROUND CSU CAMPUS THREAT CALIFORNIA FULLERTON AND ELSEWHERE. I THINK YEAH- INSULIN MCCARTY WE TALKED ABOUT THIS A LITTLE BIT WHEN YOU WERE HERE ON CAMPUS. THERE'S A REASON WHY- THEY WERE DEVELOPERS THAT ARE PRODUCING HOUSING DEPARTMENT HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS OFF- OFF OF THE- CAMPUS. AND THAT IS BECAUSE THEY THEY SEE THE DEMAND. FOR THAT HOUSING AND THEY BELIEVE THAT THEY CAN- MAKE IT A YOU KNOW AS YOU SAID THESE ARE PROFITABLE AND ENTERPRISES THIS IS NOT A NON PROFIT SO THEY BELIEVE THAT IT IS. NOT FINANCIALLY VIABLE FOR THEM TO DO THIS- THERE THERE ARE- OFF CAMPUS AND PRIVATE DORMITORIES AROUND CAL STATE FULLERTON AND ACTUALLY THE CITY OF FULLERTON IS IN THE PROCESS UP. RIGHT NOW WELL CONSIDERING- I NEW PROJECT- RIGHT OFF OFF OF CAMPUS. THERE'S A BIG DISTINCTION BETWEEN THOSE- THE- AT AND THEY SERVE THEIR PURPOSE- THERE IS WE HAVE. A NEED FOR HOUSING IF WE DIDN'T HAVE THOSE OFF CAMPUS PRIVATE HOUSING FOR PROFIT HOUSING- FACILITIES WE WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO. HOUSE STUDENTS. BUT THEY ARE TRADITIONALLY AND I'M I'M MOST OF THE TIME MORE EXPENSIVE. AND IN FACT THERE ARE ONE OF OCT PARATROOPERS AND THERE'S A PROGRAMMING DIFFERENCE REMEMBER I SPOKE. ABOUT THE- THE S. PERSISTED OF STEW ON CAMPUS SIX AS ARE. IN GRAD RATES AND LOWERING EQUITY GAPS. THERE'S A LOT OF PROGRAMMING THAT GOES ON IN RESIDENTIAL LIFE ON CAMPUS AND THAT DOES NOT GO ON. ANY ANYWHERE THE TO THE SAME DEGREE THE SAME QUALITY OFF CAMPUS. AND SO WE ARE WE ARE FOCUSED ON PROVIDING. AFFORDABLE HOUSING ON OUR CAMPUS BUT WITH GREAT- PROGRAMMING THAT GOES WITH IT THAT YIELDS THE DEMANDS THAT WE NEED TO SEE AN ORDER TO- JUSTIFY THAT HOUSE. YEAH AND THEN I KNOW YOU UC'S ARE DIFFERENT AND THEN SEE ISSUES AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE OVERALL CAN'T HOUSING AT THE UC SYSTEM. IT LOOKS LIKE THAT THEY'RE PROVIDING ENOUGH HOUSING FOR ABOUT HALF OF THEIR OVERALL UNDERGRADUATE SAID. AND IN CSU- I THINK WAS LIKE YOU KNOW A QUARTER AND THEN COMMITTEE CALLS ARE LIKE 1% IT YOU KNOW THEY'RE VERY DIFFERENT SINCE SEGMENTS. BUT WHICH WHEN WE SPOKE TO THE PRESIDENT'S THEIR LEADERSHIP AT SAC STATE THEY'RE SAYING ROUGHLY AT THIS CAMPUS HERE IN SACRAMENTO. AND AGAIN IT'S NOT APPLES TO APPLES THEY WERE SAYING THAT THERE IS A FORMULA THAT THAT THE EXPERTS SAID THAT YOU NEEDED TO HAVE HOUSING FOR ROUGHLY. A THIRD OF YOUR STUDENTS EITHER ON CAMPUS. OR ADJACENT TO CAMPUS. AND SO AT SAC STATE THERE'S TWO THOUSAND- THERE'S ROUGHLY TWO THOUSAND ON CAMPUS HOUSING UNITS IN LIKE I SAT AROUND CAMPUS WITHIN A MILE THERE'S ABOUT EIGHT THOUSAND BETS AND THE MAJORITY OF THEM HAVE BEEN BUILT THE LAST TEN YEARS I THINK. ALL OF THEM LAST- TEN YEARS ME 90% LEASED. SO THAT'S SET UP THE PHONE ON THERE AND IT HERE AT IT SAYS FOR YOU AT FULLER TEN. YOU HAVE ROUGHLY TWO THOUSAND ON CAMPUS- THE DADS AND YOUR FORTY THOUSAND CAMPUS SO DO YOU HAVE IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU DON'T HAVE A LOT. OF FOR PROFIT HOUSING. AROUND ARE NOWHERE NEAR THAT NUMBER TO GET TO THE A- THE FORM. THAT A THIRD AT YOU KNOW HOW FOR A YEARS TO. WITH AND LISTEN THEY CAN AREA. I'M NOT I WILL AS ACTUALLY BUT- I WOULD ANSWER YOUR QUESTION WAY I'M I HAD CURIOSITY WITH TO THIS AS WELL BECAUSE CSU'S HAVE IN A REMOTE OF THE C. ISSUES HEADQUARTERS BEEN KNOWN AS COMMUTER CAMPUSES WHERE STUDENTS COME AND GO TO SCHOOL AND LEAVE AND THERE'S BEEN A TRANSFORMATION OF MOST OF OUR CAMPUSES TO BE MUCH MORE COMMUNITY DRIVEN CAMPUSES WHERE STUDENTS- EXPERIENCE THE% UNIVERSITY CO CURRICULAR EARLY AS WELL AS IN THE CLASSROOM BECAUSE WE SEE THAT THE BENEFITS OF THAT. SO I ASKED ON THE TO DO TO DO A STUDY OF WHERE OUR STUDENTS LIVE THAT COMES MORE CAMPUS 50% OF OUR STUDENTS WE HAVE FORTY ONE AND A HALF THOUSAND STUDENTS 50% OF OUR STUDENTS LIVE EITHER IN OUR ZIP CODE WE ARE PRETTY MUCH OUR OWN ZIP CODE OR IN ONE EDUCATION ZIP CODE RIGHT NEXT TO US. SO WE HAVE ONLY TWO THOUSAND BEDS ON CAMPUS THERE'S PROBABLY ANOTHER THREE OR FOUR THOUSAND BEDS- ADJACENT TO THE CAMPUS AND THEN STUDENTS LIVE IN WHICH IS WHY WE NEED STUDENTS HOW SOON HOUSING THEY SHOT THEMSELVES INTO APARTMENTS AND- HOUSES AND ANYTHING THEY CAN GET. WITH TOO MANY PEOPLE IN NOT GOOD CONDITIONS AND ESPECIALLY FOR OUR STUDENTS FROM UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES WHO CAN ONLY AFFORD TO THAT- THIS IS WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE BY CORRECT CREATING MORE HOUSING ON CAMPUS THE DOUBLE EFFECT OF PRODUCING QUALITY HOUSING FOR THEM THAT THEY DESERVE AND NEED AND THE PROGRAMMING AROUND IT SO THAT THEY WILL PERSIST AND TO GRADUATION I THINK THAT ANSWER YOUR QUESTION. YEAH IT SO IT IS THAT A OUGH FORMULA THOUGH THE EXAMPLE FULLER TENDED DO YOU WANT TO HAVE A GOAL THAT YOU HAVE ENOUGH. ON CAMPUS HOUSING OR RELATIVELY CLOSE THE WHAT LET'S SAY WALKABLE HOUSE YOU COULD WALK TO CAMPUS FROM THE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT FOR A THIRD OF YOUR STUDENTS OR IS THAT JUST SOMETHING THAT SACRAMENTO. WAS DOING ON THE ROAD. I THINK IT'S A GOOD ROUGH- THUMBNAIL BUT I BUT IT ALSO IS TO DEPEND ON THE- AND SOME TALKED. I I THINK IT WAS- UC SAN DIEGO OR- THAT AVAILABILITY OF LAND CAL STATE FULLERTON DOESN'T HAVE THE LAN- AND NOT ONLY DO WE NOT HAVE THE LAND- THE- WE ARE RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF A VERY DENSE URBAN AREA. SO IT WOULD BE GREAT TO HAVE A FIFTY PERCENT- IT RATHER THAN A THIRD BUT IT'S PROBABLY NOT DOABLE OUR GOAL IS TO GET TO FIVE THOUSAND BEDS ON CAMPUS. WHICH WILL CREATE A CRITICAL MASS ON CAMPUS ALLOW US TO INCREASE SUBSTANTIALLY THE NUMBER OF FIRST TIME FRESHMEN. OR FIRST TIME COMMITTEE COLLEGE TRANSFER STUDENTS THAT COME TO CAMPUS THAT ARE ON CAMPUS BECAUSE THAT IS WHERE WE THINK WE CAN HAVE THE GREATEST IMPACT. AND THEN WELL WE ARE WE WOULD BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO SEE A MORE PRIVATE DEVELOPMENT OFF CAMPUS- BUT WE WILL. YOU KNOW WHAT WE CAN CONTROL. IS WHAT'S GOING ON ON CAMPUS. THANK YOU I QUESTIONS MISTING MISTER TANK. IF YOU HAD YOUR YOUR- IF YOU HAVE THE FUNDS HOW MUCH CAN CAMPUS HOW MUCH HOUSING CAMPUS WOULD YOU WANT TO BUILD. I'M SORRY I COULDN'T HEAR YOU IF YOU HAVE THE FUNDS HOW MUCH ON CAMPUS HOUSING WOULD YOU WANT TO BUILD THIS IS A GOOD WOULD BE FIVE THOUSAND WOULD BE MORE. WELL OUR MASTER PLAN WHICH WE JUST GOT APPROVED BY THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES CALLS FOR FIVE THOUSAND. I MEAN THAT IS. WHEN WE ONLY HAD TWO THOUSAND BEDS ON CAMPUS THAT IS THE- ASPIRATIONAL GOAL. I THINK WHAT WE WOULD WANT TO DO IS GET TO FIVE THOUSAND CREATE THAT COMMUNITY- THAT SORT TWENTY FOUR HOUR ON CAMPUS- A LIFE THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR AND THEN- A SCALE UP FROM THERE. AS AS WE GROW AS A CAMPUS. ARE YOU. AS BEING THE LARGEST CSU. I THINK THERE'S GOING TO BE A- A CHANGE AS WE COME BACK FROM- VIRTUAL LEARNING- TO A- BOTH A HYBRID KIND OF. RELATIONSHIP WHERE WE HAVE STUDENTS ON CAMPUS AT DIFFERENT TIMES DURING THE DAY. SO I THINK FIVE THOUSANDS WHERE WE'RE HEADED RIGHT NOW. GREAT HE YOU'D MENTIONED YOU'RE HAVING TO TEAR DOWN BUILDINGS THAT WERE BUILT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY. CAN YOU GIVE US A- UNDERSTANDING OF WHY. THEDEFERRED MAINTENANCE WASN'T TAKEN CARE OF OUT OF RESERVES. BECAUSE TRADITIONALLY IF YOU. IF YOU'RE BRINGING IN INCOME YOU'D SET ASIDE PART OF THEIR INCOME. FOR RESERVE SO. YOU COULD DO YOUR MAINTENANCE ANNUAL. SELL I WILL A QUESTION A COUPLE OF WAYS FIRST OF ALL WE DO SET ASIDE SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT FOR MAINTENANCE OF OUR FACILITIES AND- WE HAVE A LOT- THAT'S THOSE ARE THE BUILDING TO BE HAVE TO TEAR DOWN IS ABOUT TWO HUNDRED THREE HUNDRED BEDS- AND WE HAVE. AS I SAID ABOUT TWO THOUSAND AS THE REST OF THEM ARE MUCH NEWER AND- HAVE BEEN KEPT UP QUITE WELL- THE- WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WITH THIS BUILDING THAT WOULD BE THAT THAT'S THAT WERE BUILT IN THE NIGHT. IN EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTIES IT'S LIKE NINETEEN EIGHTIES EIGHTY FIVE OR EIGHTY FOUR I'M IS THE USEFUL LIFE OF THOSE BUILDINGS HAS JUST THEY JUST WORN OUT. THERE SEISMICALLY UNSAFE THE BONES OF THE BUILDINGS THE HVAC AND THE- AND THE PLUMBING AND THEIR MULTI STORY- HAS ROTTED AND DECAYED TO THE POINT WHERE THE USEFUL LIFE OF THE BUILDINGS IS OVER AND NO AMOUNT OF DEFERRED MAINTENANCE- WOULD HAVE. TAKING CARE OF THAT ISSUE THEY THEY'VE JUST. THE USEFUL LIFE OF THE BUILDINGS AS OVER AND THEIR SEISMICALLY UNSAFE SO WE NEED TO TAKE THEM DOWN- BUT- WE DEFINITELY PAY GREAT ATTENTION TO THE ISSUE- EXTENDING THE LIFE OF OUR- ALL OUR BUILDINGS ARMENIA MOST OF THE BUILDINGS ON THE CAMPUS THE ACADEMIC BUILDINGS THEY HAVE. BUILT IN THE NINETEEN FIFTIES NINETEEN SIXTIES NINETEEN SEVENTIES SO DEFERRED MAINTENANCE IS CONSTANTLY AN ISSUE. THAT WE'RE PAYING GOOD ATTENTION TO. RIGHT THE- BUT THE APARTMENT BUILDING OF THIRTY FIVE YEARS THAT IS NOT A USEFUL LIFE SO WAS IT BECAUSE THE ORIGINAL PROJECT WAS JUST POORLY CONSTRUCTED WAS. NOT MAINTAINED OVER ITS THIRTY FIVE YEARS TO MEAN THE BUILDING SHOULD LAST MUCH LONGER THAN THIRTY FIVE YEARS IF IT'S PROPERLY BUILT AND- PROPERLY MAINTAINED. YEAH I THINK IT'S A COMBINATION OF THINGS- YOU KNOW YOU CAN THAT BUILDING CODES WERE VERY DIFFERENT BACK THEN FOR- SEISMIC REQUIREMENTS AND- THE- YOU KNOW I WAS NOT THERE WHEN THAT BUILDING WAS BUILT SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE- SPECS WERE BUT I IMAGINE. THEY WOULD BE COMPLETE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT TODAY BUT AS WE'VE GONE AS WE'VE GONE IN TO. DO THE REPAIRS FOR THAT THE THAT BUILDING AND WE COULD WE'D WE'D LOOK AT DOING THE REPAIRS COMPLETELY REPLACING ALL OF THE PLUMBING AND HVAC AND RETROFITTING IT FOR SEISMIC THE COST OF DOING THAT EXCEEDS THE COST OF TEARING IT DOWN TO BUILDING A NEW BUILDING. THAT'S THE REAL ROUTE THERE WE COULD FIX THE BUILDING. AND WE COULD HAVE THESE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY BEDS IN THE OLD BUILDING THAT IS SAFE AND WE CAN MODERNIZE THE BUILDING BUT IT WOULD COST MORE TO DO THAT THAN TO TEAR DOWN AND BUILD A NEW BUILDING THAT WE'RE GOING TO BILL. NOW UNDERSTAND I JUST I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE- LEARNING THOSE TYPES OF LESSONS I REPRESENT A CITY. WE HAVE PLENTY OF BUILDINGS IN OUR CITY THERE OVER A HUNDRED YEARS OR- SO AGAIN- HERE WE'RE WE'RE GIVING OUT THIS GRANT MONEY. WHAT I WOULD HOPE. I SAID IT SOUNDS LIKE BOTH WHAT HAPPENED WAS POOR CONSTRUCTION AND POOR MINUTES SOUNDS SOUNDS LIKE. BOTH OF THOSE THINGS. HAPPENED- SO. IF YOU DON'T THE BLACK OF PREVIOUS BEEN A- BUT THERE'S NO THAT A- SHOULD NOT LST MORE THAN. THIRTY FIVE YEARS I DON'T CARE- YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT EIGHTEEN EIGHTY BUILDING GO TO TALK ABOUT NINETEEN EIGHTY BUILDING CODE SO. I HAVE TO BUILDING HAS BUILDING PROTECT EVOLVED. THEY'RE PLENTY OF BUILDINGS IN THERE PLENTY OF APARTMENT BUILDINGS BUILT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE THAT. ARE FINE. TOTALLY FINE. I AND MANY MEANINGFUL TO SO SOUNDS LIKE AND IT WAS. YOU KNOW SOME PEOPLE FELL ASLEEP AT THE WHEEL AND DIDN'T TAKE CARE OF THIS. THE LAST THING WE WANT IS MONEY IN THE GRANT PROGRAM TO GO TO. APARTMENT THAT AREN'T BILL WELL AND AREN'T TAKING CARE OF. SURE ABSOLUTELY YEAH I. AND I HAD SORRY TO INTERRUPT PRESENT VIRGIN MEMBER CHIANG IF I COULD I WOULD HAVE TO CONFIRM OF THE FOUR FULLER TEN IF THIS IS THE CASE BUT IN THE EIGHTIES RELATED TO THE EIGHTY FOUR OLYMPICS BOTH CAL STATE LA CAL STATE DOMINGUEZ SENATE MAY BE THE SAME AT FULLERTON. THERE WAS HOUSING BUILT FOR THE OLYMPICS AND IT WAS WOOD FRAME AND NOT THE BEST CONSTRUCTION WENT UP PRETTY QUICKLY AND BOTH CAL STATE LA AND TO MAKE A CELLS WOULD LIKE TO REPLACE THEIR HOUSING THAT CAME IN WITH THE OLYMPICS AND IT MAY BE THAT- THE FULLER TEN HOUSING PRESIDENT VIRTUES MENTIONING IS THE SAME SO WOOD FRAME NOT GREAT CONSTRUCTION SO WE WOULD AGREE ON A PERCENT ON A BETTER CONSTRUCTION COMMONSENSE THAT SOUNDS LIKE THOSE ARE THREE. BUILDINGS BUILT PERHAPS FOR TEMPORARY GAVE THANKS FOR WHAT YOU WERE BILLED WITH. A TEMPORARY HOUSING IN MIND NOT. LONG TERM HOUSING- I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT ANY MONEY. THAT'S BEING USED AT THIS FROM THE STATE FROM THE GRANT PROGRAM. IS NOT GOING TO BE BUILT FOR HOUSING THAT'S ONLY GOING TO LAST FOR. THIRTY FIVE YEARS. AT MIDNIGHT IT IS A CHALLENGE FOR US ESPECIALLY THOSE CAMPUSES THAT. MAY NOT BE ABLE TO- CHARGE THE RENTAL RATES TO FORWARD STAY A STEEL FRAME BUILDINGS SO WE HAVE ENDED UP WITH SOME WOOD FRAME BUILDINGS FOR STEEL. AND CERTAINLY THE LONGER TERM WOULD BE A PRE CAST FACILITY WHICH IS VERY DIFFICULT TO FORT SO I APPRECIATE THE COMMENT AND THAT'S KIND OF REFLECTS THE ECONOMICS BELT CAMPUSES TRY TO BALANCE WITH THE- THE RATES AND THE LOCAL MARKET. AND THE OTHER THE OTHER PIECE THAT I WOULD SAY SOME WOMEN AT CHIANG IS THAT THEY THE GOOD NEWS IS- WE'RE IN THE MIDST OF OUR CONSTRUCTION OF OUR FACE FOR AS I SAID WHICH S A BUILDING THAT IS- STATE OF THE ART AND- WELL HAD AND WHAT WE'RE LOOKING TO DO IS REPLACE THIS OLD- BUILDING THAT. AS I SAID IS UNSAFE WITH EXACTLY THE SAME- TYPE OF BUILDING SO THE QUALITY OF THE CONSTRUCTION AND THEY DEL USEFUL LIFE WILL BE MUCH LONGER. YOU SHOULD I JUST I JUST WANTED TO NOTE THIS POINT JUST BECAUSE- ON. HOW WANT TO BE SURE THAT WERE. YOU KNOW INVESTING IN THE FUTURE WE'RE NOT JUST YOU KNOW PORN DOWN. POUR MONEY DOWN THE DRAIN. EXACTLY RIGHT THAT'S WHY WE THAT WE KNOW WE LOOK AT RENOVATING THIS THIS BUILDING AND IT JUST DIDN'T MAKE SENSE TO DO IT. FOR THAT EXACT REASON. KNOWN UNDERSTOOD BUT I THINK THE- THE QUESTION IS WHY DID IT MAKE SENSE TO BUILD IT THAT WAY IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE. THAT'S THE QUESTION. SURE THANK YOU. WELL AS THEY BUILD HOUSING FOR THE NEXT LA OLYMPICS MAKES FOR THE BILL THAT FOR THE- FOR THE FIFTY HUNDRED YEAR WELL. THANK YOU I THINK OF NO IT'S NOT A TWO YEAR- WE APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR YOUR COMMENTS THAT CERTAINLY HELPS US WITH OUR DELIBERATION ON THIS ISSUE. IN THE COMING YEAR SO THANK THANKS TO ALL THE PARTICIPANTS FROM THE UC CSU INCOMMUNICADO SYSTEMATICALLY NOTED HERE BY THE LARGE PARTICIPATION IN A FROM OUR COMMITTEE MEMBERS- HOUSING AND COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY COLLEGE ACCESS IS THAT. TOP TOP PRIORITY FOR CALIFORNIA FOR ALL OF US YOU KNOW THESE THINGS GO HAND IN HAND. I THINK THAT'S WHY YOU SAW US TO TAKE- A KIND OF A RARE STEP IN IN IN DELVING INTO THE STUDENT HOUSING- FINANCIAL ISSUE FROM FROM THE STATE BUDGET PERSPECTIVE AND SO WE THINK IT'S AN APPROPRIATE PLACE TO BE AND WILL BE BACK AT IT AGAIN. NEXT YEAR AND- FIVE SPECIALLY FINE TUNING THESE THESE THREE YEARS OF ONE TIME FUNDS TO MAKE SURE WE GET OUR BIGGEST BANG FOR THE BUCK AND WE WILL COME BACK TO THE PUZZLE NEXT YOU'RE LOOKING AT THAT REVOLVING FUND ISSUE- SO WITH THAT WE WILL NOW. GO TO PUBLIC COMMENT IF ANYBODY IS IN THE AUDIENCE TO SEE WE HAVE ONE INDIVIDUAL HERE. I'M IN THE AUDIENCE AND THEN ANYBODY WHO WANTS TO PARTICIPATE. VIA THEM. VIA THAT TELEPHONE- PUBLIC COMING OPPORTUNITY CAN DO SO BY CALLING ONE. EIGHT SEVEN SEVEN SIX NINE TWO EIGHT NINE FIVE SEVEN. 977-692-8957 THE ACCESS CODE IS ONE THREE ONE FIVE FOUR TWO ZERO TWO. ACCESS CODE. ONE THREE ONE FIVE FOUR TWO ZERO TWO. THANK YOU PLEASE PROCEED THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE JEREMY SMITH HERE ON BEHALF OF THE STATE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL. WE'RE GLAD YOU'VE CONVENE THIS HEARING STUDENT HOUSING IS CRITICAL FOR THE SUCCESS OF STUDENTS ENROLLED AT HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS HOWEVER. WE BELIEVE THAT THE EDUCATIONAL NON COLLEGE BOUND APPRENTICES IN OUR STATE APPROVED APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS IS ALSO CRITICAL. THEIR EDUCATIONAL CAREERS NOT IN CLASSROOMS HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS BUT ON JOB SITES WITH THEIR HANDS. AND ALL TYPES OF WEATHER AND THEY ARE PAID A LIVING WAGE WHEN THEY'RE LEARNING. THE PROJECT ENVISIONED TODAY SHOULD BE CONSIDERED CALIFORNIA BASED CONSTRUCTION WORKER LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS PROVIDING THESE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS TO CONSTRUCTION WORKER FINANCES WHO ARE BUILDING PROJECTS TO HELP COLLEGE BOUND STUDENTS TO LEARN. AS A POLICY WE SHOULD ALL EMBRACE. TO MAKE THESE PROJECTS WORK FOR THE WORKERS AND APPRENTICES BUILDING THEM. WE ASK THAT YOU ENSURE THESE PRODUCTS ARE COVERED BY THE PREVAILING WAGE. AND A SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKFORCE IS REQUIRED TO BUILD THESE PROJECTS. DOING THIS WILL ENSURE THESE BROTHERS ARE BUILT RIGHT THE FIRST TIME SAVING MONEY. AND IT WILL INSURE THE JOB SITES ARE PROVIDED FOR APPRENTICES CURRENTLY IN THE SYSTEM HELPING THEM JOURNEY THROUGH THEIR FINISH OF QUICKER. OPENING UP A PRESS LOTS FOR FUTURE PURPOSES. THESE REQUIREMENTS FINALLY WILL. PROTECT NOT ONLY THE JOURNEY MANY WOMEN ON THESE PROJECTS. BUT CREATE A LEARNING ENVIRONMENT FOR CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY STUDENTS. THE APPRENTICES.
