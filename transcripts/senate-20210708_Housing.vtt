THE BILL TODAY- BUT I BUT

00:34:59.397 --> 00:35:00.698
HERE'S HERE'S MY CONCERN IS

THAT- THE ANALYSIS WHICH IS

00:35:05.269 --> 00:35:07.805
REALLY WELL DONE. GIVES EXAMPLE

00:35:07.872 --> 00:35:12.009
AFTER EXAMPLE. EVERY EXAMPLE OF

00:35:12.076 --> 00:35:15.112

00:35:15.179 --> 00:35:17.148

ABOUT LOS ANGELES. AND MY

00:35:22.420 --> 00:35:25.790
CONCERN REPRESENTING A- IT

00:35:25.857 --> 00:35:28.960
WOULD BE A VERY RURAL. PART OF

00:35:29.026 --> 00:35:31.462
THE STATE IS THAT- OUR ISSUES

00:35:31.529 --> 00:35:33.431
IS THAT WE DESPERATELY WANT THE

00:35:33.498 --> 00:35:34.699
EXTENSION OF PUBLIC

00:35:34.765 --> 00:35:36.200
TRANSPORTATION INTO OUR

00:35:36.267 --> 00:35:36.868
COMMUNITIES AND I'VE LONG

00:35:36.934 --> 00:35:40.571
THOUGHT THAT OUR OVER RELIANCE

00:35:40.638 --> 00:35:42.473
ON ACHIEVING CLIMATE CHANGE BY

00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:45.176
MOVING FROM- FOSSIL FUEL VIA

00:35:45.243 --> 00:35:46.811
VEHICLES TO ELECTRIC VEHICLES

00:35:46.878 --> 00:35:48.012
MISSES THE POINT WHICH IS THAT

00:35:48.079 --> 00:35:49.080
WHAT WE REALLY WANT IS PEOPLE

00:35:49.146 --> 00:35:50.915
OUT OF THEIR VEHICLES PERIOD.

00:35:50.982 --> 00:35:52.250
AND WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO DO

00:35:52.316 --> 00:35:53.718
THIS BY EXTENDING OUR PUBLIC

00:35:53.784 --> 00:35:55.419
TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS IN THE

00:35:55.486 --> 00:35:57.622
PARTS OF THE STATE WHERE PEOPLE

00:35:57.688 --> 00:35:58.789
REALLY WOULD GET OUT OF THEIR

00:35:58.856 --> 00:36:00.892
VEHICLE AND IF THERE WAS AN

00:36:00.958 --> 00:36:04.428
OPTION AND SO I WANT I THE PART

00:36:04.495 --> 00:36:05.897
OF THE CHALLENGE THAT I HAVE

00:36:05.963 --> 00:36:06.964
DESPITE THE FACT AND I AND I

00:36:07.031 --> 00:36:08.633
WANT TO. RECOGNIZE THAT THE

00:36:08.699 --> 00:36:09.734
AUTHOR HAS TAKEN SOME

00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:11.669
AMENDMENTS THAT ARE THAT ARE

00:36:11.736 --> 00:36:14.472
GOOD FOR RURAL COMMUNITIES THIS

00:36:14.539 --> 00:36:18.676
FRANKLY IS NOT GOING TO APPLY.

00:36:18.743 --> 00:36:20.011
EXCEPT FOR IN VERY LIMITED

00:36:20.077 --> 00:36:21.712
CIRCUMSTANCES AROUND TO TRAIN

00:36:21.779 --> 00:36:23.681
STATIONS IN MY DISTRICT. BUT TO

00:36:23.748 --> 00:36:25.683
THE EXTENT THAT IT SETS UP. IT

00:36:25.750 --> 00:36:27.952
SETS THE TRAIN IN MOTION IF YOU

00:36:28.019 --> 00:36:31.889
WILL- I GET CONCERNED ABOUT

00:36:31.956 --> 00:36:32.390
EXTENDING IT BEYOND THAT

00:36:32.456 --> 00:36:35.192
BECAUSE- IN MY COMMUNITIES THEY

00:36:35.259 --> 00:36:37.161
DESPERATELY WANT HOUSING. AND

00:36:37.228 --> 00:36:39.330
BUT THEY ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE

00:36:39.397 --> 00:36:40.731
THAT THAT THAT IT FITS IN

00:36:40.798 --> 00:36:42.733
WITHIN THE COMMUNITY AND THAT

00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:44.435
THERE IS THERE ARE ENOUGH

00:36:44.502 --> 00:36:46.904
PARKING SPACES- IT TO MEET THE

00:36:46.971 --> 00:36:48.239
NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY THAT THE

00:36:48.306 --> 00:36:50.608
WORDS IN MY IN MY REGION PEOPLE

00:36:50.675 --> 00:36:52.810
ARE NOT CONCERNED. ABOUT

00:36:52.877 --> 00:36:54.579
REDUCING THE NUMBER OF PARKING

00:36:54.645 --> 00:36:56.280
SPACES THEY WANT MORE BECAUSE

00:36:56.347 --> 00:36:57.882
OF SUCH OF THE SOME OF THIS

00:36:57.949 --> 00:37:00.084
OVER CROWDED. HOUSING SITUATION

00:37:00.151 --> 00:37:02.486
SO IN ANY CASE- I WANT TO THANK

00:37:02.553 --> 00:37:03.321
THE AUTHOR I THINK SHE'S DONE A

00:37:03.387 --> 00:37:04.989
GOOD JOB WITH THIS- I WOULD

00:37:05.056 --> 00:37:06.223
HAVE FELT BETTER IF IT'D JUST

00:37:06.290 --> 00:37:08.659
EXCLUDED RURAL AREAS COMPLETELY

00:37:08.726 --> 00:37:12.396

AT SOME POINT- BUT I WILL

00:39:12.850 --> 00:39:14.051
SUPPORT THE BUILDING OUT OF

00:39:14.118 --> 00:39:15.886
COMMITTEE TODAY I DO THINK MORE

SENTENCING AROUND OUR MAJOR

00:39:34.305 --> 00:39:36.507
TRANSIT STOPS SO I'D I DON'T

00:39:36.574 --> 00:39:38.576
THINK THE BILL IS FAR OFF IN

00:39:38.642 --> 00:39:40.578
THAT REGARD BUT I WOULD HOPE-

00:39:40.644 --> 00:39:42.713
THEY'LL BE SOME CONTINUED-

00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:43.848

AND I THINK THAT YOU KNOW THE

00:40:04.935 --> 00:40:05.836
BOTTOM LINE IS THAT WHEN IT

00:40:05.903 --> 00:40:08.205
COMES TO TRANSPORTATION ISSUES

00:40:08.272 --> 00:40:09.807
IN OUR RURAL AREAS WHEN IT

00:40:09.874 --> 00:40:10.641
COMES TO DISADVANTAGED

00:40:10.708 --> 00:40:12.276
COMMUNITIES AND PROBLEMS WITH

00:40:12.343 --> 00:40:13.677
PARKING THE SOLUTION IS BETTER

00:40:13.744 --> 00:40:15.513
TRANSIT IT'S US INVESTING AS A

00:40:15.579 --> 00:40:18.649
STATE IN TRANSIT AND DE

00:40:18.716 --> 00:40:20.518
INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE FOR PEOPLE

00:40:20.584 --> 00:40:22.386
TAKE UP MUCH NEEDED LAND FOR

00:40:22.453 --> 00:40:23.888
PARKS NEEDED LAND FOR

00:40:23.954 --> 00:40:25.990
BUSINESSES CERTAINLY NEEDED

00:40:26.056 --> 00:40:28.425
LAND FOR HOUSING. SO CONTINUING

00:40:28.492 --> 00:40:30.094
MISSILE CONTINUING A SYSTEM

00:40:30.161 --> 00:40:32.830
THAT WE KNOW IS LEAD TO BAD

00:40:32.897 --> 00:40:34.632
MOBILITY TRAFFIC CONGESTION AIR

00:40:34.698 --> 00:40:36.367
POLLUTION AND EVERYTHING ELSE

00:40:36.433 --> 00:40:39.069
IS NOT THE ANSWER THE ANSWER IS

00:40:39.136 --> 00:40:40.938
TO SHIFT TO OUR FOCUS ON A

00:40:41.005 --> 00:40:48.145
TRANSIT AND. THAT'S WHAT WE

00:40:48.212 --> 00:40:48.712
NEED TO DO IT I'M CERTAINLY

00:40:48.779 --> 00:40:49.313
COMMITTED A AS IS PRESS FOR

00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:49.947
CHARACTER WITH YOU ALL OF THE

00:40:50.014 --> 00:40:50.548
ON THAT THAT'S WHY I'M THERE.

00:40:50.614 --> 00:40:51.182
THAT'S THE GOAL ARE YOU SAY IN

00:40:51.248 --> 00:40:52.049
TERMS OF THE OFFICE. I UNDER

00:40:52.116 --> 00:40:53.250
THE CONCERN ABOUT WHAT THIS

00:40:53.317 --> 00:40:55.052
WILL DO TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING

00:40:55.119 --> 00:40:57.454
BUT WE HAVE DATA WE HAVE ACTUAL

00:40:57.521 --> 00:40:59.590
DATA AND ACTUAL LIVING PROOF.

00:40:59.657 --> 00:41:01.225
FIRST OF ALL WHEN SAN DIEGO DID

00:41:01.292 --> 00:41:02.426
EXACTLY THAT THE AFFORDABLE

00:41:02.493 --> 00:41:04.328
HOUSING PRODUCTION WENT UP FOUR

00:41:04.395 --> 00:41:05.796
TIMES. AND THE REASON IS

00:41:05.863 --> 00:41:07.331
BECAUSE WELL THEY MENTION VALUE

00:41:07.398 --> 00:41:08.766
CAPTURE THERE IS NO VALUE

00:41:08.833 --> 00:41:10.534
CAPTURE REDUCING PARKING THAT'S

00:41:10.601 --> 00:41:11.936
WHY MERCURY DEVELOPERS ARE

00:41:12.002 --> 00:41:13.504
STILL BUILDING WITH THE SAME

00:41:13.571 --> 00:41:14.138
AMOUNT OF PARKING EVEN IF THEY

00:41:14.205 --> 00:41:16.140
DON'T HAVE TO. WHAT IT DOES DO

00:41:16.207 --> 00:41:17.675
IS ALLOW PEOPLE WHO ARE WANTING

00:41:17.741 --> 00:41:18.976
TO BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING OR

00:41:19.043 --> 00:41:20.477
FOR MISSING MIDDLE HOUSING TO

00:41:20.544 --> 00:41:21.846
REDUCE THEIR COSTS AND PASS

00:41:21.912 --> 00:41:23.981
THAT ALONG TO PEOPLE. THAT'S

00:41:24.048 --> 00:41:26.050
WHAT IT ACTUALLY ALLOWS MORE

00:41:26.116 --> 00:41:27.685
FLEXIBILITY TO DO OTHER

00:41:27.751 --> 00:41:28.853
CREATIVE THINGS LIKE TANDEM

00:41:28.919 --> 00:41:30.654
PARKING. OFFERING SOME UNITS

00:41:30.721 --> 00:41:33.190
WITH LESS PARKING. AND SO WE

00:41:33.257 --> 00:41:35.759
KNOW THAT JUST FROM DATA THAT

00:41:35.826 --> 00:41:37.962
THAT IT'S NOT GOING TO HAVE THE

00:41:38.028 --> 00:41:39.396
TYPE OF IMPACT THAT THEY'RE

00:41:39.463 --> 00:41:40.764
AFRAID THAT WE'LL HAVE.

00:41:40.831 --> 00:41:42.132
SECONDLY THEY SAID SOMETHING

00:41:42.199 --> 00:41:43.000
VERY INTERESTING THAT THEY

00:41:43.067 --> 00:41:43.834
DON'T LIKE ALL THE PARKING

00:41:43.901 --> 00:41:45.769
BECAUSE OF THE AIR QUALITY

00:41:45.836 --> 00:41:46.370
ISSUES THE POLLUTION PROBLEMS

00:41:46.437 --> 00:41:47.938
THE CONGESTION PROBLEMS. TO

00:41:48.005 --> 00:41:49.874
SORT OF MAINTAIN THAT IN ORDER

00:41:49.940 --> 00:41:51.375
TO BARGAIN IT BACK TO TRY TO

00:41:51.442 --> 00:41:53.244
BARGAIN A BATH. REALLY JUST

00:41:53.310 --> 00:41:54.411
SEEMS LIKE THE WRONG TOPIC YOU

00:41:54.478 --> 00:41:56.480
KNOW SOMETHING'S CAUSING HARM

00:41:56.547 --> 00:41:57.214
DON'T USE THAT AS YOUR

00:41:57.281 --> 00:41:59.383
BARGAININ CHIP- IT'S JUST THE

00:41:59.450 --> 00:42:02.319
WRONG WAY TO DO IT. REMOVE THAT

00:42:02.386 --> 00:42:03.921
INSTANT THAT DISINCENTIVE.

00:42:03.988 --> 00:42:04.989
CREATING POLLUTION EVERY

00:42:05.055 --> 00:42:06.657
REQUIREMENTS IF YOU LIKE BUT

00:42:06.724 --> 00:42:08.125
LET'S CONTINUE TO FIND WAYS TO

00:42:08.192 --> 00:42:10.027
BRING DOWN THE COST OF BUILDING

00:42:10.094 --> 00:42:11.262
HOUSING THAT'S WHAT THIS WILL

00:42:11.328 --> 00:42:15.866

THE LOCAL. AUTHORITIES THAT

01:16:07.863 --> 01:16:10.432
IT'S NOT SAFE AND HABITABLE SO

01:16:10.499 --> 01:16:12.868
IT'S KNOCKED OUT OF THE HOUSING

01:16:12.935 --> 01:16:15.203
IF THEY WOULD QUALIFY FOR ONE

01:16:15.270 --> 01:16:17.439

BILL. THERE DOES NOT APPEAR TO

01:16:45.033 --> 01:16:46.902
BE AN EXCLUSION FOR THAT

01:16:46.969 --> 01:16:49.137
HOWEVER IT IS NOT EXPLICITLY

01:16:49.204 --> 01:16:52.574
INCLUDED SO I THINK THAT MIGHT

01:16:52.641 --> 01:16:57.446
END UP BEING. PART OF A.

01:16:57.512 --> 01:16:59.381
WHETHER THE TREASURER IN THE

01:16:59.448 --> 01:17:02.751
DEVELOPMENT OF THE PROGRAM-

01:17:02.818 --> 01:17:05.187
PURSUES IT. THE TITLE NEW

01:17:05.253 --> 01:17:08.090
HOUSING IS OF COURSE ONLY A

TITLE IN ISN'T NECESSARILY

01:17:10.592 --> 01:17:14.363
SPECIFICALLY IN THE STATUTE SO-

01:17:14.429 --> 01:17:16.064
MY ANSWER IS THAT HI I THINK

01:17:16.131 --> 01:17:17.866
IT'S ONE OF THOSE GRAY AREAS

01:17:17.933 --> 01:17:20.502
WHERE IT DOES NOT. EXPLICITLY

01:17:20.569 --> 01:17:22.070
INCLUDE IT BUT IT DOES NOT

01:17:22.137 --> 01:17:24.406
EXCLUDE ARMED AND I CERTAINLY

01:17:24.473 --> 01:17:26.675
SEE THE POINT OF THE- OF

01:17:26.742 --> 01:17:28.877
SENATOR WHITE HOUSE CAN ASKING

01:17:28.944 --> 01:17:30.912
THE QUESTION BECAUSE- PRIOR TO

01:17:30.979 --> 01:17:33.582
HIS GOOD WORK AND OTHERS IN IN.

01:17:33.648 --> 01:17:35.951
GETTING EIGHTY USE TO BE

01:17:36.018 --> 01:17:37.352
ACCEPTED BY OUR LOCAL

01:17:37.419 --> 01:17:39.354
GOVERNMENTS AND ALLOWED. THERE

01:17:39.421 --> 01:17:41.990
WERE ISSUES THEY JUST HOWEVER

01:17:42.057 --> 01:17:43.558
WERE ILLEGAL SO THEY WERE

01:17:43.625 --> 01:17:46.762
ILLEGAL GRANNY FLATS. AND THERE

01:17:46.828 --> 01:17:48.764
ARE YOU KNOW IT'S IMPORTANT IF

01:17:48.830 --> 01:17:51.533
WE CAN TO SUPPORT TRYING TO GET

01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:53.969
THOSE TO MEET CODE AND BE LEGAL

01:17:54.036 --> 01:17:55.971
SO THEY CAN BE GOOD HOUSING

01:17:56.038 --> 01:17:57.973
UNITS SO I APPRECIATE THE

01:17:58.040 --> 01:18:00.342
INTENT. THOUGH I THINK SOME OF

01:18:00.409 --> 01:18:01.309
THAT WILL HAVE TO BE IN

01:18:01.376 --> 01:18:02.477
INTERACTIONS WITH THE

01:18:02.544 --> 01:18:03.612
TREASURER'S OFFICES THEY

01:18:03.678 --> 01:18:05.714
DEVELOPED THE PROGRAM AND OF

01:18:05.781 --> 01:18:07.616
COURSE THERE IT'S GIVEN

01:18:07.682 --> 01:18:09.451
DEPENDING ON HOW THE FINANCING

01:18:09.518 --> 01:18:11.353
IS DEVELOPED. WHETHER THAT

01:18:11.420 --> 01:18:13.455
FINANCING YOU KNOW IT WOULD BE

01:18:13.522 --> 01:18:14.790

01:18:15.991 --> 01:18:17.459
VARIOUS ISSUE SO ALL OF THOSE

01:18:17.526 --> 01:18:18.894
WOULD HAVE TO BE WORKED OUT BUT

01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:20.962
I CAN CERTAINLY SEE A VALUE TO

01:18:21.029 --> 01:18:23.799
WHAT. SENATOR Y. SKI RACE AND

01:18:23.865 --> 01:18:26.134

OUR MONEY TO THIS IT UP WITH

01:18:40.182 --> 01:18:41.149
THE PAINTED I DON'T THINK IT

BEEN A DETERMINATION. THAT IT'S

01:18:48.557 --> 01:18:51.226
NOT THAT IT'S NO LONGER CO

01:18:51.293 --> 01:18:52.994
HABIT OF NORTH THEN THEY WOULD

01:18:53.061 --> 01:18:54.529
I WOULD HOPE THAT THE TREASURE

01:18:57.065 --> 01:18:58.366

01:19:23.291 --> 01:19:23.825
THIS IS FOR COMMITTEE MEMBERS

01:19:23.892 --> 01:19:28.763

SCANNER YOU MAY CLOSE. I N. I

01:19:29.598 --> 01:19:30.899
WANT TO GIVE A SHOUT OUT TO

01:19:30.966 --> 01:19:33.034
SENATOR CASKEY IS BEING THE-

01:19:33.101 --> 01:19:35.036
FIRST LEGISLATOR TO REALLY PUSH

01:19:35.103 --> 01:19:39.107
THIS- THIS- GREEN LIGHTING OF

01:19:39.174 --> 01:19:40.342
USE AND OF COURSE THERE'S BEEN

01:19:40.408 --> 01:19:41.877
SUBSEQUENT LEGISLATION BUT AS

01:19:41.943 --> 01:19:43.745
WE HEARD FROM THE TESTIMONY IT

01:19:43.812 --> 01:19:45.747
HAS BEEN AMAZING SUCCESS STORY.

01:19:45.814 --> 01:19:47.716
WE HAVE ADDED A GREAT DEAL OF

01:19:47.782 --> 01:19:49.651
HOUSING UNITS AND WHAT I WOULD

01:19:49.718 --> 01:19:53.288
NOTE THE- THAT MIGHT LEAD LEAD

01:19:53.355 --> 01:19:54.689
WITNESS DID NOT INDICATE THAT

01:19:54.756 --> 01:19:56.925
THAT TURNER STUDY POINTED OUT

01:19:56.992 --> 01:19:58.793
SO ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT SOME

01:19:58.860 --> 01:20:00.095
PEOPLE MIGHT RAISE ABOUT EIGHTY

01:20:00.162 --> 01:20:01.663
USES WELL YOU KNOW IF THEIR

01:20:01.730 --> 01:20:04.332
CHEST STUDIOS OR WHATEVER. ARE

01:20:04.399 --> 01:20:06.468
THEY REALLY ASSISTING US TO GET

01:20:06.535 --> 01:20:08.103
FAMILY HOUSING BUT ONE OF THE

01:20:08.170 --> 01:20:09.271
THINGS THAT THE TURNER STUDY

01:20:09.337 --> 01:20:11.740
SHOWED IS THAT LOW INCOME

01:20:11.806 --> 01:20:14.242
HOMEOWNERS. THE EIGHTY USE THAT

01:20:14.309 --> 01:20:16.878
THEY PROVIDE TEND TO BE FAMILY

01:20:16.945 --> 01:20:19.181
UNITS AND THEY TEND TO BE AT A

01:20:19.247 --> 01:20:21.183
AT A RENTED AT AFFORDABLE RATES

01:20:21.249 --> 01:20:23.585
SO THE MORE THAT WE CAN ASSIST

01:20:23.652 --> 01:20:25.687
A LOW INCOME HOMEOWNERS BE ABLE

01:20:25.754 --> 01:20:28.089
TO. ACHIEVE AN EIGHTY YOU THEN

01:20:28.156 --> 01:20:29.991
WE ARE ADDING FAMILY HOUSING

01:20:30.058 --> 01:20:31.326
UNITS AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT

01:20:31.393 --> 01:20:32.961
THIS FINANCING PROGRAM REALLY

01:20:33.028 --> 01:20:36.298

HEATERS NEW VENTURE INTO ROUGH

01:32:49.230 --> 01:32:51.165
ALL OF THAT REQUIRES IT RIGHT

01:32:51.232 --> 01:32:52.033

THAT PARTICULAR QUERY. WELL I

01:33:47.188 --> 01:33:48.222

THERE'S NO OPPOSITION AND

01:33:49.991 --> 01:33:51.092
THAT'S ALWAYS THAT'S ALWAYS

01:33:51.158 --> 01:33:52.526

APARTMENT. UNITS TO BE IMPROVED

01:34:00.334 --> 01:34:03.137
MMHM BECAUSE THEN IT TRIGGERS.

01:34:03.204 --> 01:34:04.638

GOING TO QUOTE IT EXACTLY RIGHT

01:34:18.886 --> 01:34:21.355
BUT- ONE OF MY GOOD COLLEAGUES-

01:34:21.422 --> 01:34:23.391
COMMENTED THAT OUR ELECTRIC

01:34:23.457 --> 01:34:26.861
VEHICLE. GRAHAM IT PROVIDES

01:34:26.927 --> 01:34:28.562
COVERAGE FOR THE RICH AND- DOES

01:34:28.629 --> 01:34:32.099
NOT. PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR

01:34:32.166 --> 01:34:33.300
WORKING WORKING FOLKS IN

01:34:33.367 --> 01:34:34.602
PARTICULAR PEOPLE OF COLOR TO

BE ABLE TO AFFORD- A VEHICLE

01:34:37.304 --> 01:34:39.573
THAT THAT SERVES THEIR NEEDS-

01:34:39.640 --> 01:34:42.476
IN RECOVERING SO I WELL I WILL

01:34:42.543 --> 01:34:44.045
SUPPORT THIS TODAY I HAVE REAL

01:34:44.111 --> 01:34:45.646
SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT WHETHER

01:34:45.713 --> 01:34:46.680
EVER GONNA REACH DOWN FAR

01:34:46.747 --> 01:34:51.318
ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO GET. ON A

01:34:51.385 --> 01:34:53.354
THE PROGRAM TO WORK SO THAT

01:34:53.421 --> 01:34:55.289
WE'RE WE'RE OUR NUMBER ONE

01:34:55.356 --> 01:34:58.025
PRIORITY ARE ARE PEOPLE WHO

01:34:58.092 --> 01:35:01.095
LIVE IN THAT. IN IN AREAS WHERE

01:35:01.162 --> 01:35:02.596
THEY HAVE THE WORST AIR QUALITY

01:35:02.663 --> 01:35:03.798
WHICH SHOULD BE THE SOUTH COAST

01:35:03.864 --> 01:35:08.069
AND THE- THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND

01:35:08.135 --> 01:35:12.073
TO REQUIRE LANDLORDS. TO START

01:35:12.139 --> 01:35:13.941
IMPLEMENTING THESE KINDS OF

01:35:14.008 --> 01:35:16.677
PROGRAMS WHEN THEY DO AN

01:35:16.744 --> 01:35:19.880
UPGRADE. AND HAVE THEM SIT.

01:35:19.947 --> 01:35:22.149
EMPTY DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE TO

01:35:22.216 --> 01:35:24.452
ME SO- I'M I'M REALLY CONCERNED

01:35:24.518 --> 01:35:26.287
ABOUT MOVING TOO FAR AHEAD OF

01:35:26.353 --> 01:35:28.589
WHERE WE'RE WHERE IT'S GOING TO

01:35:28.656 --> 01:35:29.457
MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE IN THE

01:35:29.523 --> 01:35:30.691
URBAN AREAS TO MAKE MAKE ME

01:55:23.750 --> 01:55:25.952
THE DEVELOPERS. AND THAT'S

01:55:26.019 --> 01:55:26.853
REALLY IMPORTANT IT CAN OUR BE

01:55:26.919 --> 01:55:28.655
VERY CHALLENGING FOR DEVELOPERS

01:55:28.721 --> 01:55:30.823
TO SEE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS-

01:55:30.890 --> 01:55:32.091
BECAUSE THEY'RE OFTEN REPEAT

01:55:32.158 --> 01:55:33.426
PLAYERS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT

01:55:33.493 --> 01:55:36.429
AND SO MANY OF THEM FEEL VERY

01:55:36.496 --> 01:55:38.197
CHILLED ACTED IN THERE RIGHT

01:55:38.264 --> 01:55:39.165
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO MAKE

01:55:39.232 --> 01:55:40.300
SURE THAT WE ARE GETTING IT

01:55:40.366 --> 01:55:42.568
RIGHT. UP WITH THIRD PARTIES

01:55:42.635 --> 01:55:44.070
WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS

01:55:44.137 --> 01:55:45.738
BILL SO I REALLY APPRECIATE THE

01:55:45.805 --> 01:55:49.309
OPPORTUNITY MAKING SURE THAT

01:55:49.375 --> 01:55:50.543
WE- DO AND THAT PLAN CORRECTLY-

01:55:50.610 --> 01:55:52.045
I THOUGHT MAYBE ONE THE LACK.

01:55:52.111 --> 01:55:53.713
OF POINT OF MAKE HERE IS THAT

01:55:53.780 --> 01:55:55.315
REQUIRING AN APPLICANT HE USED

01:55:55.381 --> 01:55:56.783
THE OFFICE REALLY RIPS THE

01:55:56.849 --> 01:55:58.484
LAYING A FINAL RESOLUTION AND

01:55:58.551 --> 01:55:59.752
MAKING IT HARDER IN MANY CASES

01:55:59.819 --> 01:56:01.821
THE POSSIBLE. RIPPLES PURSING

01:56:01.888 --> 01:56:03.222

THE HSA- I PERSONALLY THINK

01:56:11.264 --> 01:56:13.733
IT'S A IT'S PROBABLY A MUCH

01:56:13.800 --> 01:56:14.767
STEEPER APPROACH TO ESTABLISH

01:56:14.834 --> 01:56:17.937
THAT. OFFICE AND THEN REQUIRE

01:56:18.004 --> 01:56:20.006

02:08:03.709 --> 02:08:05.444
PURPOSE HERE. IS TO STRENGTHEN

02:08:05.511 --> 02:08:08.047
THAT. I WOULD JUST SAY FOR THE

COMMITTEE. PART OF WHAT.

02:08:10.215 --> 02:08:11.550
ATTRACTED US TO THIS APPROACH

02:08:11.617 --> 02:08:13.919
IS THAT IT IS TWO THINGS ONE-

02:08:13.986 --> 02:08:14.686
THAT WAS BROUGHT TO US BY THE

02:08:14.753 --> 02:08:16.121
CALIFORNIA HOUSING PARTNERSHIP

02:08:16.188 --> 02:08:17.222

02:08:19.691 --> 02:08:21.226
TO STRENGTHEN. THE BUILT UP

02:08:21.293 --> 02:08:22.294
AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THIS IS

02:08:22.361 --> 02:08:24.129
SOMETHING THAT THEY HEARD- IN

02:08:24.196 --> 02:08:25.164
INTERVIEWS AND CONVERSATIONS

02:08:25.230 --> 02:08:26.598
WITH FOLKS IN THE SPACE AS THEY

02:08:26.665 --> 02:08:28.901
WENT AROUND THE STATE. AND TALK

02:08:28.967 --> 02:08:30.569
TO PEOPLE. AND THE OTHER THING

02:08:30.636 --> 02:08:31.270
THAT GIVES ME CONFIDENCE ABOUT

02:08:31.336 --> 02:08:32.771
THIS APPROACH IS THAT. AS WAS

02:08:32.838 --> 02:08:34.073
MENTIONED IT'S BEEN IN PLACE IN

02:08:34.139 --> 02:08:35.007
MASSACHUSETTS FOR SEVERAL

02:08:35.074 --> 02:08:36.842
DECADES NOW. THERE'S RESEARCH

02:08:36.909 --> 02:08:38.644
THAT WAS DONE BY MIT. WHERE

02:08:38.710 --> 02:08:39.611
THEY LOOKED AT THIS AND THEY

02:08:39.678 --> 02:08:41.680
WERE ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE VERY

02:08:41.747 --> 02:08:43.649
CONCLUSIVELY. THE BENEFITS OF

02:08:43.715 --> 02:08:44.450
HAVING AN APPROACH LIKE THIS

02:08:44.516 --> 02:08:45.784
THE BENEFITS OF HAVING AN

02:08:45.851 --> 02:08:46.552
ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS AND HOW

02:08:46.618 --> 02:08:48.220
THAT ACTUALLY. WAS ABLE TO HELP

02:08:48.287 --> 02:08:49.822
MOVE THE BALL FORWARD. AND WHAT

02:08:49.888 --> 02:08:50.889
CAUGHT MY EYE IN A

02:08:50.956 --> 02:08:52.758
PARTICULARLY. WAS THE NUMBER OF

02:08:52.825 --> 02:08:54.860
CASES THAT ULTIMATELY SETTLED-

02:08:54.927 --> 02:08:56.361
DEBT THAT THIS PROCESS SECTION

02:08:56.428 --> 02:08:57.429
COURAGE EIGHTY PLUS PERCENT

02:08:57.496 --> 02:08:58.797
CASES TO GET TO SETTLEMENT VERY

02:08:58.864 --> 02:09:00.365

MEASURE SUCCESS- AND ALSO. WE

02:25:47.071 --> 02:25:49.640
CAN LOOK AT. WHAT HIS WORKING

02:25:49.707 --> 02:25:51.742
BEST IN WHICH COMMUNITIES SO

02:25:51.809 --> 02:25:53.010
THAT WE KNOW WHAT THE BEST

02:25:53.077 --> 02:25:58.149
PRACTICES ARE ON. I REPRESENT

02:25:58.216 --> 02:26:00.618
SIX COUNTIES AND- PART OF THE

02:26:00.685 --> 02:26:02.086
CHALLENGES THAT EVERY COUNTY IS

ON WELL NUMBER ONE IS WE DO WE

02:26:09.861 --> 02:26:12.597
DO OUR- OUR HOMELESS. COUNT AS

02:26:12.663 --> 02:26:14.298
A AS A POINT IN TIME AND I'M

02:26:14.365 --> 02:26:15.967
NOT SURE THAT'S THE BEST WAY TO

02:26:16.033 --> 02:26:17.335
DO IT I'M NOT SURE I HAVE AN

02:26:17.401 --> 02:26:18.736
IDEA OF WHAT IS A BETTER WAY

02:26:18.803 --> 02:26:21.873
BUT- I DO KNOW THAT THE- THE

02:26:21.939 --> 02:26:24.008
POINT ACCOUNT HAS SOME REAL.

02:26:24.075 --> 02:26:26.677
CHALLENGES AND I THINK IF YOU

ASKED ANYBODY ON THE STREET

02:26:28.079 --> 02:26:28.779
TODAY THEY WOULD SAY THAT

02:26:28.846 --> 02:26:30.181
HOMELESSNESS IS GOTTEN WORSE

02:26:30.248 --> 02:26:32.116

DOLLARS. AND THE MONEY THAT WE

02:26:36.654 --> 02:26:39.757
PUT OUT FOR PROJECT ROOM KEY. I

02:26:39.824 --> 02:26:40.758
THINK THAT'S THE NAME OF THE

02:26:40.825 --> 02:26:42.927
PROJECT. THAT BOUGHT HOTELS

02:26:42.994 --> 02:26:45.096

02:26:45.163 --> 02:26:47.298
THEM. I'D LIKE TO KNOW HOW MANY

02:26:47.365 --> 02:26:48.766
PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY HOUSED

02:26:48.833 --> 02:26:51.936
BECAUSE OF THAT AND- SO IT YOU

02:26:52.003 --> 02:26:53.304
MIGHT JUST THINK THAT THAT

02:26:53.371 --> 02:26:54.205
KEEPING THAT KIND OF

02:26:54.272 --> 02:26:55.506

02:26:55.573 --> 02:26:56.874
I KNOW H. CD IS STARTING TO

02:26:56.941 --> 02:27:00.144
COLLECT UP- A LOT OF DATA BUT-

02:27:00.211 --> 02:27:01.279
THE MORE THAT WE CAN SEE IT

02:27:01.345 --> 02:27:03.114
FROM. FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE IN

02:27:03.181 --> 02:27:05.316
TERMS OF HOW WE ROLL OUT MY

02:27:05.383 --> 02:27:06.284
NEED I THINK THE BETTER IT'S

02:27:06.350 --> 02:27:08.486
GOING TO BE SO- I'M HOPING THAT

02:27:08.553 --> 02:27:09.453
THAT THAT'LL BE ONE OF THE

02:27:09.520 --> 02:27:11.189
TASKS AND- I DO SUPPORT THE
