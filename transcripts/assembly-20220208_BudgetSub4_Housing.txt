HOUSING AND IS PART OF THE SOLUTION TO HOMELESSNESS BUT SOURCE SUPPORTIVE SERVICES TO ADDRESS THE HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES THAT MANY OF THESE FOLKS FACE ONE THIRD OF PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS HAVE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES THAT MAKE IT HARDER FOR THEM TO REMAIN HOUSE WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT SUPPORT OF SERVICES. OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS THE STATE HAS INVESTED SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO RESPOND TO HOMELESSNESS INCLUDING TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN THE HOMELESSNESS HOUSING ASSISTANCE AND PREVENTION PROGRAM WHICH WE WILL OFTEN REFERRED TO AS HAPPIER. LAST YEAR THE ASSEMBLY PRIORITIZE MORE ACCOUNTABILITY THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVEL FOR HOW WE COORDINATE OUR INVESTMENT IN THE BUDGET AS A RESULT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE REQUIRED TO DEVELOP A HOMELESSNESS ACTION PLAN BASED ON LOCAL DATA TO DIRECT THEIR HAPPY FUNDING. AND SET PERFORMANCE GOALS TO EXCESS ADDITIONAL FUNDING LAST YEAR'S BUDGET ALSO REQUIRE THE STATE COMPLETE LANDSCAPE ASSESSMENT TO DETERMINE HOW WE ARE SPENDING OUR RESOURCES TO REDUCE HOMELESSNESS TODAY I HOPE TO HEAR MORE ABOUT EFFORTS TO COORDINATE THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVEL. AND TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS AND I WILL SAY OFTEN IN THESE POLICY CONVERSATIONS WE GET IN THE WEEDS IN THE TECHNICALITIES OF THE PROBLEM BUT LET'S ALSO REMEMBER THAT I THINK MANY OF US HERE BELIEVE THAT SOLVING THIS PROBLEM IS A MORAL IMPERATIVE AS WE SEE THE HOMELESS IS GROWING IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND OUR STREETS REGARDLESS OF WHAT PARTY WE COME FROM WE COME HERE.

TIME TO HAVE AN ADVOCATE LIKE CHAU LEADING ON THE EFFORT- FROM DOWN IN SAN DIEGO JOE I WONDER IF YOU COULD EXPAND A LITTLE BIT ON SOME OF THE LEADERSHIP THAT YOU'VE BEEN PROVIDING LOCALLY TO REALLY TRY TO TEASE OUT. SOME OF OUR APPROACH IS TO DEAL WITH BLACK HOMELESSNESS AND YOU KNOW SOME OF THE EXISTING ON CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE IN FUNDING. AND I'M POSSIBLY IN POLICY AS WELL- TO CORRECT SOME OF THE RISKS DISPARITIES AND YOU KNOW TRY TO TRY TO REACH POPULATIONS OF WOMEN LEFT BEHIND THAT THERE'S POLICY THAT THE HEIGHTENED HIGHER LEVEL. THAT THERE IS A PLACE THAT DOESN'T ALLOW CERTAIN PEOPLE. LIKE THAT THE SPARE CARE ACT PEOPLE OR PEOPLE OF COLOR. TWO IF THEY HAVE CRIMINAL RECORDS OR IF THEY HAVE LIKE. TODAY BACKGROUND IT MIGHT BE THE MY HOME. BUT BUILT BARRIERS THAT ARE KEEPING P. FROM HELP AND MOST OF THE TIME THOSE PEOPLE ARE HAVE CRIMINAL BACKGROUNDS ARE PEOPLE OF COLOR AND NOT A LOT IN ALL CASES BUT- BUILDABLE. SOME OF THE- NOW THERE ARE. AT KEEPING PEOPLE FROM HOUSE. AT SCHOOL ITEM THAT I KNOW. THE THING YOU JOE EXACTLY WE TO WORK ON THE THINK ALL THESE POLICY CONSTRAINTS AS WELL TO MAKE SURE THERE ARE NO BARRIERS- AND- AND HELP TO- YOU KNOW REACH A LITTLE BIT DEEPER FOR- YOU KNOW THAT COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN LEFT BEHIND. OVER THE DECADES. THANK YOU'RE WELCOME. MISS FONG. I JUST HAVE A QUICK QUESTION AND BUT AND I'M SURE IT'S MORE LIKE THE ANSWER BUT ARE THERE PROGRAMS THAT YOU'RE SEEING NOW THAT- ARE EFFECTIVE AND ARE THERE OTHER PROGRAMS THAT- USE YOU SEE ARE BEING CHALLENGED WITH WITH VARIOUS REASONS THAT NEED IMPROVEMENT. I'M PERFECT PRESSURE AT TWO MAIN. WELL I DON'T KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF RESOURCES OUT THERE BUT- I JUST RIGHT NOW I JUST DON'T SEE IT BEING EFFECTIVE IN HELPING. A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THERE STILL BE SOME MANY PEOPLE OUT THERE THAT ARE. AND THAT'S HELPED THAT TELLS THE STORY RIGHT THERE. THE OVER A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA AND IF IT WAS EFFECTIVE A LOT OF- THOSE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN HOUSE BY NOW- I GUESS MAYBE WOULD MAKE IT EVEN MORE. OKAY WHAT'S INTERVIEW WHEN WE WERE SANTEE THERE WASN'T SEVEN HUNDRED PEOPLE THAT WE HAD IN HOUSE- DURING THE CALL THE PORTION AND NOW IT SAYS DOUBLE BECAUSE OF COLOR WITHIN PEOPLE LOSING THEIR JOBS IN THEIR HOMES BEING INFECTED SO- IF IT WAS EFFECTIVE A LOT OF THESE PEOPLE WOULD BE. IN HOMES RIGHT NOW. I WOULD SAY THAT- CERTAINLY THE HOMELESSNESS PREVENTION SPACE WE ATTENTION TO THAT I THINK THAT'S KIND OF WHAT YOU'RE HIGHLIGHTING THAT THERE A LOT OF PEOPLE AT RISK OF BEING HOMELESS.

AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CREATING SOME REALLY GREAT POLICY BASED ON WHAT YOU'VE SHARED THANK YOU. THANK YOU BYE BYE. WE ARE GOING TO MOVE ON TO OUR PANEL NUMBER TO OUR PANELISTS TODAY- FOR FUNDING I FUNDING OVERVIEW. INCLUDE SAID LOU THIS MODUS WITH THE- FISCAL AND UP AND THE L. A. O. MS MONETARY THERE. GOOD AFTERNOON AND MY LIST WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE I'M- NOT AYE WE SPEAKING FROM I DON'T SEE MY SHARE OPTION BEING ACTIVE QUITE YET. CAN WE PLEASE ACTIVATE HER SHARE SCREEN. THANK YOU ONE MOMENT. IT'S GONNA. YES WE CAN SEE YOUR SCREEN. THANK YOU STARTED. I'M COMMITTED TO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF THE MAJOR STATE SPENDING ACTIONS IN RECENT YEARS RELATED TO HOMELESSNESS THE HAND I'LL BE SPEAKING FROM IS AVAILABLE ON OUR WEBSITE. SOME OF THE FOREVER BY THE FUNDING OVER BILL PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT OF CONTEXT FOR THE SIGNIFICANCE OF MEDITATION WE'VE SEEN IN THE STATE WHICH I'LL DESCRIBE NEXT. WELL WE KNOW HOMELESSNESS IS A COMPLEX PROBLEM WITH MANY CRISIS THE HIGH COST OF HOUSING IS A SIGNIFICANT FACTOR IN THE STATE OF THIS CRISIS. TWO POINT FIVE MILLION HOUSEHOLDS IN THE STATE ARE COST BURDENED MEANING THEY SPENT MORE THAN 30% OF THEIR INCOME ON HOUSING. THESE LISTING HOUSE. THAT ARE SPENDING A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THEIR INCOME ON HOUSING. JOB LOSS AREN'T EXPECTED EXPENSE COULD RESULT IN HOUSING INSTABILITY AND HOMELESSNESS. IN JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE MOST RECENT YEAR WE HAVE COMPLETE FEDERAL DATA. CALIFORNIA HAVE WHERE PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS THAN ANY OTHER STATE WITH ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY ONE. THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED INDIVIDUALS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. WE RECENTLY LEARNED THROUGH- ADDITIONAL FEDERAL DATA. THAT ABOUT FIFTY ONE THOUSAND PEOPLE EXPERIENCED HOMELESSNESS IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE WITHIN SHELTERS. DUE TO FACTORS RELATED TO THE PANDEMIC WE DON'T HAVE THE NUMBERS. RELATED TO UNSHELTERED HOMELESSNESS. SO IF THE HOME DISCUSS HAS BECOME SORT OF MORE ACUTE IN RECENT THE STATE HAS TAKEN LARGER INFO AND- LAW GOVERNMENT OCCURRED. TO ADDRESS HOMELESS. OVERALL THE STATE HAS INCREASED ITS ROLE IN ADDRESSING HOMELESSNESS BY PROVIDING SIGNIFICANT ALTHOUGH ONE TIME TEMPORARY FUNDING TOWARDS INFRASTRUCTURE AND FLEXIBLE AID TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. SO ON THE NEXT HE GAVE ME COMBINED EIGHTY PEOPLE THAT SUMMARIZES THE MAJOR BECAUSE OF MEDICATIONS. AND WE PROVIDE A BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE PROGRAM'S REFLECTED ON THE TABLE. THANK YOU SEE IT'S REALLY INTO THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN SCHOOL YEAR WHEN THE STATE BEGAN TO TAKE A MORE ACTIVE FISCAL ROLE IN ADDRESSING HOMELESSNESS. VOTERS APPROVED NO PLACE LIKE HOME INITIATIVE WHICH PROVIDES PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING TO PEOPLE WITH MENTAL ILLNESS WHO ARE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS OR AT RISK OF HOMELESSNESS. IN THE THING FISCAL YEAR THE BUDGET PROVIDED FLEXIBLE EMERGENCY AID TO THE LARGEST CITIES AND CONSUMES A CARE IN THE STATE. THROUGH HEAT THE HOMELESS EMERGENCY PROGRAM. THE TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY BUDGET CONTINUE TO RECOGNIZE THE NEED FOR LOCAL FLEXIBLE EIGHT THROUGH THE ESTABLISHMENT. OF THE HOUSE. IN CONTRAST TO HEAT- FROM THE PREVIOUS YEAR HALF WITH LESS FOCUSED ON SHORT TERM SOLUTIONS AND WANTED TO ENCOURAGE MORE REGIONAL COLLABORATION TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS. HOWEVER IN MARCH OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE STATE EXPANDED ITS SUPPORT AND APPROACH TOWARDS HOMELESSNESS FOLLOWING THE EMERGENCE OF THE COVENANTING CONDEMNING. WE SEE PROJECT WILL KEEP AGAIN IN THAT YEAR WHICH SHALL HELP LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ACQUIRE HOTELS AND MOTELS TO PROVIDE FOR IMMEDIATE HOUSING NEEDS OF PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS AS A WAY TO HELP INTERNATIONAL TRUCK AND REDUCE THE SPREAD OF. THE NINETEEN WITHIN THE COMMUNITY. FULL FUNDING HAS CONTINUED FOR HOME KEY OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS THIS WAS INTENDED TO BE A TEMPORARY PROGRAM AND SO TO THAT END TO THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET. PROVIDED A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS TO ROOM KEY TO HELP TRANSITION PARTICIPANTS INTO PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. AT THE SAME TIME TO THE BUILDING OFF OF THE FACT THAT THE PROJECT ROOM KEY THE TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET ESTABLISHED. THE HOME KEY PROGRAM. SIMILARLY TO REPEAT THIS PROGRAM ALLOWED ACQUISITION OF HOTELS AND MOTELS AS WELL AS OTHER PROPERTIES IN THIS CASE IT WAS TO ALLOW THE HEALTHY TO USE FOR PERMANENT HOUSING FOR PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS OR AT RISK OF HOMELESSNESS. AND FUNDING FOR WHOM HE HAS CONTINUED INCLUDE SUBSEQUENT YEARS. CONCURRENT BUT ACTIONS. RELATED TO ADDRESSING. THE PANDEMIC THE C. HAVE CONTINUE TO PROVIDE FLEXIBLE AID TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND- PARTICULARLY THE LARGEST CITIES COUNTIES AND CONTINUES TO CARE. TO HAPPEN. FOR TURNING THE PROGRAM RULES FOR HALF OF THE VAULT AND MOST RECENTLY AS WELL OUTLINED IN THE AGENDA. THE LEGISLATURE HAS ESTABLISHED STATUTE THAT REQUIRES LOCAL ACTION PLANS THAT WILL HELP WITH ACCOUNTABILITY AND WITH THE LEGISLATURE PROVIDING OVERSIGHT. OF THAT PROGRAM OVER TIME. CAN FINALLY THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO PROVIDED FUNDING TO LOCAL ENTITIES TO ADDRESS SUPPORT ENCAMPMENTS WITHIN THEIR JURISDICTIONS AND SO OVERALL YOU SEE THAT THE STATE HAS SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDED ITS FISCAL ROLL OVER THE YEARS. AND IT'S FROM PRIMARILY THROUGH SORT OF A ONE TIME OR TEMPORARY FUNDING THAT SUPPORTS INFRASTRUCTURE AND FLEXIBILITY TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. AND THE SECOND TABLE TO MORE DESCRIPTIONS OF THE PROGRAMS- I JUST DESCRIBED AND THE FINAL TWO PEOPLE IN MY COMMENTS TODAY. JUST REALLY HIGHLIGHTS THE REST OF THE ACTIONS RELATED TO HOMELESSNESS ACROSS THE STATE WE HIGHLIGHT. OTHER PROPOSALS ACROSS THE NUMBER OF DEPARTMENTS THAT HAVE SOME RULED IN ADDRESSING HOMELESSNESS AND IT REALLY GIVES YOU A MORE COMPLETE PICTURE OF TOTAL SPENDING AT LEAST IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. AND A PICTURE OF THE NUMBER OF DEPARTMENTS REALLY INVOLVED IN ADDRESSING THIS COMPLEX ISSUE. INTO THAT COMPLETES MY PREPARED COMMENTS REPORT OVERVIEW OF FISCAL MATTERS I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS WHEN APPROPRIATE. THANK YOU RESTAURANTS STAR UP WITH A QUESTIONS AND ON TO THE PANEL. HOW CAN THE STATE ENSURE THAT THE FUNDING WE ARE CURRENTLY INVESTING IN THESE VARIOUS STATE PROGRAMS ARE COMPLIMENTING EACH OTHER. AND NOT DUPLICATING EFFORTS. I HAVE TO QUESTION IT IS YOU KNOW ONE THAT'S OUR CENTRAL IN OUR MIND IT REALLY DOES TAKE DISCUSSIONS LIKE TODAY WHERE WE SEE SORT OF. CRIME PEOPLE ON THE GROUNDS ARE DELIVERING SERVICES AND RECIPIENTS OF THE SERVICES JUST SOUTH OF WHERE THE SUCCESSES AND pCAN THE STATE CAN CONTINUE TO OF ALL ITS RESPONSE- WE YOU KNOW WE HAVE AN ELECTRIC CHALLENGES WITH. HAVING TO CLEAR PLAN IN THE PAST AND HAVING STRONG OVERSIGHT. WE DO NOTING THAT THE STATE IS NO LONGER IN THE SAME PLACE THAT WAS IN IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN WHEN IT STARTED TO TAKE A MORE ACTIVE ROLE- THERE HAS BEEN PROGRESS IN THE STATE'S INFRASTRUCTURE IN IN AND DEVELOPING A PORTFOLIO OF PROGRAMS IT'S A REALLY AFFECTING. WHERE THE SUCCESSES WHERE THE CHALLENGES AND HOW TO MORE CLEARLY. IN INVEST IN. THE SUCCESSFUL WILL BE IMPORTANT FORWARD. IN LINE WITH THAT. MAKING SURE. THE STATE IS A COUPLE AND HOW IT THE BALLOT. THE FIFTY LOCAL RELIEF. MOVING FORWARD IN ASSESSING WHERE'S THE RIGHT BALANCE OF. LEVERAGE STILL LOCAL X. BUT THE STATE ALSO HAS A IN FOR. AND BEST PRACTICE ARE BEING. AND PACKED UP LOCAL THE LOCAL LEVEL WILL BE IMPORTANT. THANK YOU MISS BROWN IS AMONG THE PASS IT OVER TO OUR VICE CHAIR PARCO CHERISH AND MISTAKES. I'M HAPPY TO BE YOUR VICE CHAIR CARILLO- GET YOU LAID OUT- FOR ELOQUENTLY HERE THE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS THAT EXIST TO SUPPORT OUR HOMELESS POPULATION. AND YOUR ESTIMATION WHAT DO YOU SEE IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE PROGRAMS THAT MOST IMMEDIATELY GETTING PEOPLE OFF THE STREETS AND INTO SOME FORM OF HOUSING. NO THAT'S A DIFFICULT QUESTION TO ANSWER ADMINISTERED OF THE ELITE WITH A LITTLE BIT WE THINK SIGNIFICANT EVOLUTIONS IN THE- DATA REQUIRED FROM HAPPENANYTHING WILL BE HELPFUL MOVING FORWARD IN ADDRESSING THAT TYPE OF QUESTION. BUT TO DATE THERE IS QUITE LIMITED DATA- WE HAD THERE'S AN ANNUAL REPORT THAT CAPTURES- KEEP FUNDING ON THE FIRST YEAR OF HAPPENING YOU HAVE SOARED INITIAL UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THAT FUNDING IS- BEING. ENCUMBERED AND ACTUALLY YOU KNOW STANFORD- EXITS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT SO WHAT ARE THE OUTCOMES OF PEOPLE BEING SERVED BY THAT PROGRAM IT'S STILL. VERY EARLY STAGES- AND THEN YOU DON'T ANSWER GOOD ANSWERS AT THIS TIME FOR THEM. BUT WE DO THINK THAT THE ACTIONS THE LEGISLATURE HAS TAKEN MORE SONORA RECENTLY RELATED TO HAVE WILL HELP ADDRESS THE QUESTIONS OVER THE LONG TERM. AND DO YOU THINK THERE'S A ROLE FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO- EITHER LEGISLATIVELY OR THROUGH OTHER MECHANISMS PUSH FORMER DAD OR SOME SOME SORT OF POLICY SOLUTION ON THE DATA QUESTION TO ENSURE THAT WERE ACTUALLY- ANALYZING THESE PROGRAMS MOST EFFECTIVELY. ABSOLUTELY THAT SORT OF- IN PRIOR PRIOR YEAR AND SORT OF CONTINUE TO THAT THAT'S TRUE THAT'S- TO LET. AND ANY ACTIONS AT ALL TO TAKE THIS YEAR SHOULD HAVE TO DESTROY OVERSIGHT ENSURE THAT THERE ARE. NEW MEASURE- OUT. THAT ARE OF TRACK TO DOUBLE. LOCAL AND ITSELF ACCOUNTABLE TO ENSURE THERE'S PROPER IN THIS. THANK YOU. GOING TO PASS IT ON TO MISS COOPER THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. WHAT'S THE AMOUNT OF FUN FOR TO COMBAT HOMELESS SINCE. TWENTY EIGHTEEN. YES THE TABLE HAVE ON PAGE TWO OF THE HAND. HOW ABOUT NINE POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS TOTAL. AND FIFTY WOULD SQUEEZE IF THE IF THE MAJOR INVESTMENT IN HOMELESSNESS IS I SORT OF MENTIONED IN MY FINAL TO PREPARE COMMENTS. THERE IS A LOT OF FUNDING SPREAD ACROSS A NUMBER OF OTHER DEPARTMENTS THAT HAVE SOME ROLE IN ADDRESSING HOMELESSNESS. IT'S BEEN A FINAL PICTURE OF OUR OF OUR HAND OUT WE HAVE AN ADDITIONAL FOUR POINT SIX. JUST A TWENTY ONE TWO. HUNDRED TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO- ACROSS THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES HEALTH CARE SERVICES THE DEPARTMENT VETERANS AFFAIRS AND SO THAT IS. PART OF THE CHALLENGING DYNAMIC IN REALLY IS SUFFERING THROUGH WHERE THE THICKNESS OF THE WHERE THE CHALLENGES RELATED TO THE STATE'S RESPONSE IT IS A VERY CONFUSED- SET UP ACTIONS ARE BEING TAKEN SO. COORDINATION AND REALLY FAST I'M NOT REALLY SURE WHERE ALL THE DOLLARS WHICH IS A DIFFICULT TASK TO UP TO. REALLY FAST BUT ALSO HOW. THEY'RE BEING USED. OKAY THANK YOU. SWARD GREAT THANK YOU I'M THINKING FOR THE REPORT TODAY ON TO BUILD ON WELL- I AM A THAT WE'RE STILL MODERNIZING I THINK WHAT IS THE HOMELESS DATA INFORMATION SYSTEM- SO HOPEFULLY WE'LL HAVE SOME COMMON METRICS THAT EVERYBODY IS REPORTING INTO IS THAT WE CAN ANALYZE THESE AND MY QUESTION FOR YOU IS THE L. EO IS I'M HOPING THAT YOU KNOW WITH THIS- IT'S GREAT TO SEE A LOOK BACK ON HOW MUCH WE'RE INVESTING OBVIOUSLY ALIGNS WITH OUR CRITICAL PRIORITIES FOR CALIFORNIA THEY WANT TO KNOW THAT WE'RE MAKING THE INVESTMENTS BUT THEY ALSO WANT TO KNOW WHAT THE OUTCOMES ARE. AND SO I'M WONDERING FOR THE L. IT WAS OFFICE GOING FORWARD FOR MANY OF THESE SPENDING ACTIONS THAT ARE HERE YOU KNOW HOW MANY FAMILIES WERE ANSWERED BY THE FAMILY HOMELESS CHALLENGE GRANT- HOW MANY BEDS WERE EXPANDED UNDER THE ACUTE BED CAPACITY EXPANSION SO FOR EACH OF THESE PROGRAMS- MAYBE AND IN SUBSEQUENT REPORTS GOING FORWARD IN FUTURE YEARS AND I WILL ASK THIS IN MY TIME IN THE LEGISLATURE BECAUSE I DO I DO WANT TO SEE ALL THE DOTS CONNECT WHAT IS THE EFFECT AND THAT'S WHERE THE OUTCOMES. OF SO MANY OF THESE PROGRAMS BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO PRIORITIZE AND MAKE THESE INVESTMENTS OVER TIME BUT WE HAVE TO TAKE BACK HOME IN SHORT CONSTITUENTS THAT WE ARE MONITORING AND EVALUATING AND RE DIRECTING A PUBLIC RECORD REVENUES. TOWARDS THE MOST EFFECTIVE PROGRAMS. SO MY QUESTION IS COULD ELLY ELLS OFFICE TENTATIVELY COMMIT. TO POSSIBLY EXPAND SOME OF YOUR ANALYSIS IN FUTURE REPORTS TO REALLY GET INTO THE OUTCOMES. NOT JUST THE DOLLARS SPENT BUT THE OTCOMES. AND I'D ALSO LIKE TO KNOW IF YOU'RE NOT ABLE TO- MEASURE THOSE OUTCOMES BECAUSE- YOU JUST DON'T HAVE THE SUFFICIENT DATA FROM FROM THE DEPARTMENTS. THAT'S RIGHT TO OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE AN OUTCOME THAT IS LIMITED BY SAID WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION COLLECTS THE IN THEIR PROGRAMS AND SO WE'RE HAPPY TO SORT OF WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE. THROUGHOUT THIS BUDGET CYCLE TO HELP INFORM WHAT I'M DATA REQUEST MAY BE ASSOCIATED WITH ANY ACTIONS OF LEGISLATURE ULTIMATELY TAKES TO FILL. THAT MOVING FORWARD- BUT WE ALWAYS SORT OF ENGAGING ON PLANS PROPOSALS WITH AN EYE TOWARD. WHAT IS AVAILABLE AND WHAT IS THE LEGISLATURE SORT OF SEEN AS A RESULT OF ITS- MAJOR. CHANNELS THANK YOU M. AND THERE'S A NOTE THE NEXT PANEL IS A DEPARTMENT WE CAN ACTUALLY- MAKES MORE QUESTIONS. FROM DATA INFORMATION AS WELL. YES WE'RE GETTING THERE AND MISTER LUCKY. I WASN'T SURE IF IT WAS MR LANCASTER FARGO MISTER LACKING. THANK YOU. HOW MUCH OF THE AMOUNT RESHOOT IT- HERE'S HERE'S ONE OF MY BIGGEST. WHAT WE START TALKING ABOUT HOMELESSNESS IS THERE'S SUCH A HEAVILY OF SUCH A HEAVY FOCUS ON HOUSING ONLY WHEN. THINGS HIT A CRISIS POINT WITH WITH THE HOMELESS. OUR INTERVENTION SYSTEM RIGHT NOW IS LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND I'M TELLING YOU BEING FROM THAT PROFESSION. IT'S VERY INEFFECTIVE AND IT IS THE WORST PROBABLY SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WE HAVE. EVOLVED INTO BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT ONE OF OUR BIGGEST CHALLENGES IS TO ADDRESS. THE DRIVING FORCES THAT LEAD TO HOMELESSNESS AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE PERCENTAGES ARE. BUT IT'S GOT TO BE VERY HIGH PERCENTAGE OF THOSE WHO SUFFER FROM MENTAL ILLNESS OR SOME TYPE OF ADDICTION. UNTIL WE FOCUS ON SERVICES AVAILABLE FOR. THESE KINDS OF DIFFICULTIES WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO SEE THIS GROWING POPULATION IN MY OPINION- AND SO. IF YOU COULD JUST HELP ME SEE THAT WERE ACTUALLY FOCUSING ON. SERVICES FOR MENTAL ILLNESS AND ADDICTIONS. AS WE DISCOVER THESE. PEOPLE AND IN THESE CONDITIONS I'LL BE A LOT MORE CONFIDENT AND- THE REMEDIES THAT- OR BEING. SPENT THE THAT THE DOLLARS ARE BEING SPENT SO HEAVILY TOWARDS. SO I GUESS MY ONLY QUESTION IS ARE WE ADDRESSING THE SERVICES ASPECT OF THESE HOMELESSNESS PEOPLE. SOME PROGRAM- WHICH IS TO COME BACK TO IT A NUMBER OF TIMES IS A VERY FLEXIBLE SOURCE OF REVENUE FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THE SERVICES AND CERTAINLY INELIGIBLE USE- TO THIS IS WITHIN THE BROAD HOMELESSNESS SPACE I WOULD SAY THAT THERE'S ALSO SORT OF MORE TARGETED MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AVAILABLE DESERVED AND- OUTSIDE MY DIRECT PORTFOLIO. BUT I AM AWARE OF THE BEHAVIOR HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE- PROPOSAL THAT WAS ALLOCATED AS PART OF A TRIPLE LAST YEAR THAT ALLOCATED BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TOWARDS PROVIDING INFRASTRUCTURE OVER THE LONG TERM AND SERVICES ASSOCIATED WITH THAT TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF PEOPLE WITH SEVERE BEHAVIOR HEALTH CONDITIONS. AND OUR RESOURCES IN OTHER AREAS OF THE BUDGET AND COMES BACK TO THE ISSUES WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING WHICH IS HOW WE SHOULD COORDINATE INTEGRATE ALL OF THE STATE ACTIONS THAT SORT SERVE TO HAVE A ROLE IN ADDRESSING- THIS OF THE MANY REASONS WHY SOMEONE. MAY BE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. A MY LAST COLUMN HAS TO DO IF IT'S OKAY WITH THE CHAIR IS. PREVENT NEEDS TO BE OF OUR- OUR REMEDY- SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES AND I FEEL LIKE. IT'S UNDER EMPHASIZED. THE END OF IT THE SERVICE COMPONENT OF. MENTAL HEALTH. AT AT LARGE I MEAN WE UNTIL WE REALLY FIGURE THIS OUT BECAUSE I THINK WE HAVE. SUCH A LARGE SEGMENT OF OUR POPULATION THAT DEALS WITH THIS CHALLENGE IN THEIR LIFE- WE'RE GONNA BE MISSING THE VOTE AND I REALLY FEEL LIKE THIS FOCUS ON. ON ON THE MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTIONS. IS A REALLY REALLY POWERFUL PIECE OF THE SOLUTION. COMMENT THANK YOU MISTER TWISTER FONG. I THANK YOU CHECK RIO- I WANTED TO BUILD OFF OF A QUESTION THAT- I CALLED FROM SAN DIEGO ASKED ON THE LAST PAGE OF YOUR- YOUR- REPORT- IT INDICATES THAT THERE WAS FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO- BUDGET- FOR UP THE HOMELESS THAT DATA INTEGRATION SYSTEM AS THERE HAVE HAVE YOU DONE ANY ANALYSIS IN TERMS OF. WHAT THE CURRENT STATUS OF IT IS IT BEING EFFECTIVE IS IT IS THERE A COORDINATION IS THE DAY THAT THERE. GOOD OR BAD. SO THE HOMELESS SEVEN INTEGRATION SYSTEM IS AVAILABLE ONLINE TODAY- FOCUS YOUR ACCESS THAT THROUGH THE COUNCIL'S WEBSITE- AT THIS POINT OF THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE IS STILL IT'S STILL QUITE LIMITED IT'S MOSTLY SORT OF AN INVENTORY AS FAR AS WE SORT OF UNDERSTAND OF SERVICES ARE DELIVERED ACROSS THE STATE AND WHERE THE SERVICES WERE DELIVERED WHETHER IT WAS NO LESS S. C. O. C. LOS ANGELES OR NO OKAY ARE YOU COUNTY AND SOME DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION ABOUT THE PEOPLE SERVED. OUR UNDERSTANDING WITH BEGINNING WITH THE RESTORATION MUCH INTEREST AND I WELCOME YOU TO ASK THEM MORE ABOUT AS THEY SPEAK IN THE NEXT IS AT THE CEMEX EXPECT X. PRODUCTION ME THAT SYSTEM OVER TIME THERE IS MORE INFORMATION THAT COULD BE USEFUL IF THE LEGISLATURE MAKE SORT OF POLICY AND FUNDING DECISIONS BUT IT SEEMS LIKE THAT IS- YOU KNOW WELL SORT OF CONTROVERSY OVER TIME SHARE. IT IN AND I GUESS THAT THAT LEADS TO THIS THAT THE SECOND QUESTION I HAVE WHICH IS THE U. EMPHASIZE COORDINATION AND CERTAINLY WOULDN'T WE NEED THE DATA- TO FACILITATE THAT BUT IT FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE EVALUATING THIS LAUNDRY LIST OF- PROGRAMS ME HOW WOULD YOU GRADE THE INTERACTION AND COORDINATION. RIGHT NOW THAT'S CURRENTLY HAPPENING. I THE- COUNCIL IS REALLY ADEPT. POINT THERE IS WE- JUST. THAT NOT ONLY READ THE COUNCIL- COUNCIL HOME BUT I'LL SORT OF REGIS- IT- IT'S- TO ALLOW FOR THEIR TO BE A- CHAIR. WITH HOUSING AND HUMAN EACH AS WELL AS A LITTLE SOME OF THE OTHER PARTICIPANTS. FROM JUST REPRESENT OF THE DEPARTMENTS THAT ACTUALLY SORT OF THE HASN'T DIRECTORS OF DEPARTMENTS. AND HOW THAT'LL WORK IN PRACTICE AND ENCOURAGING GREATER COORDINATION IS YET TO BE SEEN. BUT THEY'RE CERTAINLY NOT A FACTOR- IS A RECOGNITION AND EFFORT TO MAKE. HEADWAY THERE. SO WE I'M- A IT'S KIND OF AN INCOME AT THE MOMENT THAT EVERYTHING IS STILL BEING FLESHED OUT. YEAH YEAH I THINK THIS IS A VERY COMPLEX PROBLEM AND THEY'RE SORT OF BUSINESS- ADDRESS SOME ASPECTS OF THE STATE RESPONSE BUT CERTAINLY GIVEN THE COMPLEXITY- MORE RESOURCES AND TIME I'M AN EFFORT WILL SORT OF BE REALLY NECESSARY TO ADDRESS. THE COMPLEX CHALLENGES BEFORE THE STATE HERE. AND IF I MAY MR FONG I THINK THAT MIGHT BE A GOOD A GOOD POINT OF REFERENCE TO PIVOT TO THE NEXT PANELS- ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING THE DATA QUESTIONS ABSOLUTELY AND I DO SO I ONE LAST QUESTION WHICH IS I AND I'M JUST TRYING TO GET AYE I GUESS FROM MY PERSPECTIVE MILLION- I'M JUST TRYING TO GET KIND OF A THREE THOUSAND FOOT LEVEL TO KIND OF. FRAME MY QUESTIONS TO THE MINISTRATION IS. IS IT FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE DO YOU SEE A STRATEGY THAT'S FORMULATING A WIN WHAT IS DO YOU BELIEVE IN YOUR MIND IS THE ADMINISTRATION'S STRATEGY. FOR FORTY THAT HOMELESSNESS I MEAN I SEE A LAUNDRY LIST OF. A PROPOSALS THAT ARE BEING FUNDED. BY OUT IT DO YOU FEEL THAT THERE IS COORDINATION OR DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THE MISSION IS JUST. THROWING YOU KNOW A BUNCH OF MONEY INTO AGAINST THE WALL AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. HOW TO DEAL WITH A BUNCH OF THINGS. INSTEAD OF. FINDING A MORE. COHESIVE WAY OF- ADDRESSING. HOMELESSNESS IN AN INSIGNIFICANT WAY. AND I AND THAT WE MUST QUESTION. SO IN OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE SORT OF BROAD PORTFOLIO OF PROJECTS I'M SORRY OF A PROGRAM THAT HAVE BEEN FUNDED. I'M TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS IT SEEMS PRETTY CLEAR. US THAT ACTUALLY TWO MAIN PILLARS OF ACTION ONE IS INFRASTRUCTURE. DO YOU SEE THAT THROUGH ROOM KEY AND HOME KEY SO THAT PROVIDING RESOURCES TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. THAT THEY CAN BUILD THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE- PORTFOLIO SO THAT THERE ARE OPTIONS TO BOTH YOUR SHORT TERM AND LONG TERM OPTIONS. FOR PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS AND THE OTHER SHOULD MEET TAYLOR THE STATE'S RESPONSE HAS BEEN THIS FLEXIBLE EIGHT DIRECTLY TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THROUGH THE HOUSE PROGRAMS IT REALLY SEEMS LIKE THERE'S A PIECE TO ALL ACTION AT THIS POINT- THAT MAKE. MAKE THE SORT OF CENTRAL RESPONSE INTO THAT THE I THINK THAT'S A MAJOR POLICY QUESTION FOR THE LEGISLATURE MOVING FORWARD. BECAUSE YOU KNOW TO THESE TWO COLORS SHOULD'VE SEEM LIKE THE RIGHT STEPS MOVING FORWARD- THE LEGISLATURE. CONTINUE TO THINK THAT THE BEST POSITION PER TO DELIVER. SAYS WITH SOME SOME PERHAPS GUIDANCE AND POLICY DIRECTION THE STATE. OR IS THERE TO MORE IN. IN A- CERTAIN FRESH. TO THAT THROUGH THE WAY THE STATE WILL- HOMELESS CERTAINLY FORWARD. OR COME OF THE TWO WEEKS IN THE PAST ABOUT REASONS WHY SOMEONE MAY FIND HIMSELF HOMELESS SO AFFECTING WHAT IS THE RIGHT WRIST. GET BACK VERY WAYS IN WHICH MAYBE ON ADDRESS ARE SHE DOES RECALL. WHAT IT CAUSES QUITE COMPLETE. A THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU ANOTHER HUNTER QUESTION YEAH MY ASK YET THAT'S NOT GOOD I'M NOTHING GENERAL. THEY'RE ON THE HEALTH. IN FOR PRO SO SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY SIX MIN DOLLAR. YEAH WHAT DOES THAT ENTAIL WHAT WHAT ARE THEY GETTING FROM THAT PROGRAM THAT SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS. DURING L. I'M NOT THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ANALYST WITH THE L. A. S. AND HAPPY TO TRY TO CONNECT ARE SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS WITH YOU TO MAKE SURE YOU HAVE. A FULL UNDERSTANDING OF IT. RIGHT- BUT I NAY THAT GENERALLY THAT THE PROGRAM IS. PRETTY EARLY ON IN ITS DEVELOPMENT- IS THAT- I GUESS MY QUESTION IS ARE THEY ARE THEY PROVIDING. FUNDING FOR EXISTING MENTAL HEALTH CLINICS ARE THEY TRYING TO PRODUCE NEW ONES OR BRING MORE PEOPLE AND ARE THEY TRYING TO EDUCATED WORKFORCE THAT WILL DO THAT OR ALL OF THE ABOVE BECAUSE WHAT THIS GOES TO IS WHAT MY COLLEAGUE WAS TALKING ABOUT WAS THE MENTAL HEALTH ASPECT OF HOMELESSNESS- SOME OF THE HOME KEY PROJECTS THAT HAVE BEEN DONE OUT AND ARE. IN IN MY REGION- HAVE HAD MARGINAL SUCCESS BECAUSE WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS THEY'RE PUT PUTTING PEOPLE INTO HOUSING. AND THERE NEVER WHILE THEY'RE THERE AND THEY TARA AND THEN THEY'RE OUT. IN AFTER AROUND HIM UP AND TRY TO GET THEM BACK IN. AND THEN AFTER MOVE EVERYBODY OUT SO THEY CAN RE HAVE THE WHOLE THING AGAIN. AND THEY MOVE PEOPLE THEN BECAUSE WE HAVE GIVEN THE VERY SERIOUS ISSUE. ON BOTH SIDES THAT HAVE TO BE TREATED DIFFERENTLY. WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE LOSING HOMES AND FAMILIES BEING DISPLAYED. THAT'S ONE THING. BUTTHIS THIS MENTAL HEALTH PART OF IT IS HUGE BECAUSE WE HAVE AN I'VE EXPERIENCED THIS. WHERE WE THINK SOMEBODY IS A HOMELESS PERSON. AND ACTUALLY THE GUY REMEMBER HAVING A WE USED TO ALWAYS GONE JEFF SEIZURES. SHE WORE BAGS SHE SLEPT ON THE WORK ON THE BENCH SHE PUSHED A CART AROUND. JET ALL THE- ALL THE APPEARANCE OF BEING HOME WITH. WHICH SHE DID SHE ACTUALLY HAD A HOUSE AND WAS ACTIVE. IN A DECENT NEIGHBORHOOD. IT WILL TORN UP BUT SHE HAD A HOUSE. IN IT WAS THE MENTAL HEALTH HEALTH ASPECT OF THIS. AND THAT'S WHERE I FEEL LIKE WE'RE MORE TO LEAVE AND WE'RE GETTING LEFT BEHIND IS WE REFUSE TO DEAL WITH. THE MENTAL HEALTH ASPECT OF IT. AND THAT'LL HELP A LONG WAY SO THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY FOCUS SOME OF THIS. YOU KNOW TWELVE BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT WE WERE SPENDING. ON ON ON PEOPLE THAT CAN BE HELPED- THE- HAVING SHORT TERM ISSUES AND JOB ISSUES. AND THINGS LIKE THAT. SO THAT'S WHY THAT'S WHY I WAS ASKING ABOUT THIS THE- BEHAVIOR HEALTH ASPECT OF THIS. IT'S SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS. BUT WHAT'S IT GOING TO HOUSE AND ATTACKING THE PROBLEM AND AS YOU SAID BEFORE YOU CAN GET ME THAT INFORMATION FROM THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH FOLKS. SO THAT WOULD I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT BECAUSE THAT HELPS ME UNDERSTAND WHAT MORE WE NEED TO DO TO TRY TO GET A GRIP ON THIS MNTAL HEALTH ASPECT OF THE HOMELESSNESS POPULATION THANK YOU.

MENTAL HEALTH AND SEEN THE BEHAVIORAL DOLLARS AND HOW THEY'RE USED WE'VE HAD A CONVERSATION BEFORE US TO POTENTIALLY HAVING. ADDITIONAL HEARINGS. AND COMBINING THOSE ISSUES AND JUST A GENTLE REMINDER THAT WE DON'T HAVE THE EXPERTS AND STUFF FOR THOSE PARTICULAR QUESTIONS BUT THAT'S CERTAINLY. SOMETHING I THINK THAT WE ARE ALL VERY MUCH INTERESTED IN.

THAT TO DATE HAS FUNDED NEARLY SEVEN THOUSAND HOUSING UNITS FOR PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. OR AT RISK OF BECOMING HOMELESS. WE ALSO. THE NATION'S LARGEST RENTAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM ALONG WITH THE STRONGEST EVICTION PROTECTION MEASURES THUS FAR WE'VE ASSISTED AND PREVENTED A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY TWO THOUSAND LOW INCOME RENTER HOUSEHOLDS. FROM BEING ADDICTED BY MOBILIZING TWO BILLION DOLLARS AND RENTAL ASSISTANCE. ALSO THE PORTABILITY IS THE MAJOR DRIVER TO HOMELESSNESS HENCE WE CONTINUE MOVING WITH SPEED TO DEPLOY OVER TEN BILLION DOLLARS TO PRODUCE MORE UNITS AND TO EXPAND AFFORDABLE HOUSING OPTIONS. COLLECTIVELY THESE HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS INVESTMENTS REFLECT AN UNPRECEDENTED PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE ADMINISTRATION THE LEGISLATURE ARE FEDERAL AND LOCAL PARTNERS TO TACKLE WHAT IS ARGUABLY THE STATE'S MORE FOR THE MOST FORMIDABLE CHALLENGE.

WELL FUNDING INVESTMENTS ARE CRITICAL- IN COORDINATION AMONG STATE ENTITIES- IS ALSO A CRITICAL TO THEIR PLAN TO JUST SHARE A LITTLE MORE- ABOUT WHAT THE STATE IS DOING IN TERMS OF. COORDINATING ACROSS. STATE AGENCIES AND STATE DEPARTMENTS. AS A RESULT OF THE ENHANCEMENTS POSSIBLE BY THE LEGISLATURE THROUGH AT TWELVE TWENTY THE HOMELESS COORDINATING AND FINANCING COUNCIL WAS RE LAUNCHED ON JANUARY FIRST OF THIS YEAR. AS THE CALIFORNIA INTERAGENCY COUNCIL ON HOMELESSNESS OVER CAL I C. H. I SERVICE THE CULTURE OF KELLY C. H. ALONG WITH MY COLLEAGUE DR MARTIN KELLY A SECRETARY OF THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH.

WE MUST ASSURE THE LINKAGE OF HOUSING TO THE KINDS OF SERVICES AND SUPPORT THAT PEOPLE NEED TO THRIVE INCLUDING FELT IN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES AND SUPPORTS. ESCROWED SHARES SECRETARY KELLY AND I ARE WORKING WITH COUNCIL MEMBERS TO INTEGRATE HEALTH HUMAN SERVICES AND HOUSING. INTO ARTS STATES HOMELESSNESS RESPONSE SYSTEM WITH A HOLISTIC PEOPLE CENTERED APPROACH THAT NOT ONLY SERVES THE IMMEDIATE NEEDS THAT ALSO PUBLICLY TEMPLES IMPORTANT CROUTONS IS A PUBLIC. AT OUR FIRST MEETING- OUR FIRST- ACCOUNT I C. H. MEETING ON JANUARY THE TWENTY SEVENTH WE WERE FORTUNATE TO HAVE DR MARGOT KUSHEL SHARE HER INSIGHT AND RESEARCH. AMONG OTHER THINGS SHE CRYSTALLIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF FOCUSING ON BOTH HEALTH AND HOUSING BY REMINDING US THAT THE MOST POWERFUL MEDICINE TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS IS HOUSING OF THE MOST DEVASTATING THINGS THAT CAN HAPPEN TO SOMEONE TO HELP. WE KNOW THAT HEALTH CHALLENGES CONTRIBUTED TO THE REST OF HOMELESSNESS AND HOMELESSNESS DRAMATICALLY WORSENS HEALTH. THEREFORE WE MUST WORK TO INTEGRATE OUR HOUSING AND HEALTH STRATEGIES AND RESOURCES. IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE WE CREATED A STRONG FOUNDATION WITH THE STATE'S FIRST COMPREHENSIVE ACTION PLAN TO PREVENT AND END HOMELESSNESS. ACTION PLAN SETS TANGIBLE AND MEASURABLE GOALS AND BENCHMARKS FOR PROGRESS. THE PLAN WAS DEVELOPED IN PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS IN PEOPLE WITH LIVED EXPERIENCE. ACTION PLAN SUCH AS RACIAL EQUITY AND EVERYTHING THAT WE DO. AS A RESULT THIS PLAN- THAT WAS CREATED IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE I WILL BE USED BY THE CAL I SEE AGE AS A ROAD MAP TO GUIDE OUR COLLECTIVE PROSTATE INTO WORK TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS SYSTEM WIDE HOUSE FOR THE FIRST TIME AN INTEGRATED AND COMPREHENSIVE DATA COLLECTION SYSTEM. CALLED THE HOMELESS DATA INTEGRATION SYSTEM OR H. THE I. S. THIS SYSTEM ALLOWS US TO COLLECT AND ACCESS DATA FROM LOCAL HOMELESSNESS RESPONSE SYSTEMS. ALL FORTY FOUR CONTINUE CONTINUE ONCE ACROSS THE STATE HAVE PROVIDED DATA TO THE STATE.

SPECIFICALLY IT INCLUDES A SET OF PROPOSED ACTIONS THAT INCORPORATE HOUSING SERVICES WITH AN ADDITIONAL TWO BILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT INCLUDING FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO THE COWLIKE C. H. A COUNCIL TO EXPAND BEING HAPPEN RESOLUTION GRANT PROGRAM. IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT THESE INVESTMENTS ALSO BE MET BY INVESTMENTS IN HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS FROM OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS. WE KNOW THAT THE HOMELESSNESS CRISIS PREDATES THE PANDEMIC IN THAT THE FEDERAL INVESTMENTS TO DATE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO FULLY ADDRESSED THE CRISIS THAT FAMILIES AND INDIVIDUALS ACROSS OR STAYED IN THE PROCESS OF COUNTRY CONTINUE TO FACE. WE ALSO NOTE THAT- THIS WILL PERSIST AND CONTINUE TO DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACT BLACK INDIGENOUS PEOPLE OF COLOR COMMUNITIES.

PLANS WITH THE STATE LAW BY LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO DISMANTLE BARRIERS TO HOUSING PRODUCTION BOTH OF THESE THINGS THAT WILL AMELIORATE HOPEFULLY ONE THAT YOU READY CAKES HOMELESSNESS AND PREVENT THAT MORE PEOPLE IN POVERTY ENTER. THE DEVASTATED CYCLE OF HOMELESSNESS WE MUST HOLD LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ACCOUNTABLE SHOULD THEY NOT HONOR THEIR HOUSING COMMITMENTS. ARE HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY UNIT WITHIN EIGHT CD PLAYS A CRITICAL ROLE IN ENSURING THE LOCAL LEADERS WILL FEEL THEIR LEGAL RESPONSIBILITIES TO PLAN ZONE FOUR AND PER MEETING SHARE OF THE STATE'S HOUSING NEEDS.

THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND SUPPORT AND WE LOOK FORWARD. TO THE REST OF THE BASIS WHICH- THANK YOU TO OUR- THIRD PANEL HERE WE WILL IT BACK HERE THE DIS AND I START WITH MR COOPER. THANK MILLION SHARES FOR THE- QUESTIONS THAT- DO WE CHANGES TO THE L. WENT LETTERMAN PATRICIA ACT ARE NEEDED TO HELP REDUCE HOMELESSNESS. AND WHAT CHANGES YOU THINK ARE NEEDED. AS A MEMBER DO YOU MIND REPEATING THAT QUESTION I DIDN'T GET THAT THIS PART SURE DO YOU BELIEVE THAT CHANGES TO THE LAN LETTERMAN PETROUS SHORT ACT- NEEDED. ANNA SO WHAT CHANGES ARE NEEDED. YES OF THE LEGISLATURE X. THINK ABOUT SPENDING CONSERVATORSHIP. THANK YOU SO MUCH ASSEMBLY MEMBER COOPER FOR THAT QUESTION AND I- WOOD WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY TO FOLLOW UP WITH YOU AND I THINK THAT THE HARDEST QUESTION ABOUT EIGHT AND- THAT THE ROLE THAT HE PLAYS IN TERMS OF OUR OVERALL BULLISHNESS RESPONSE SYSTEM IS ONE THAT. REQUIRES YOU KNOW FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION AND SO I WOULD LOVE TO FOLLOW UP WITH THE OFFICE ON THAT OKAY WELL ON HIS BELLY OF THREE MEMBERS. FROM FORMALLY PUBLIC SAFETY IS REALLY A BIG ISSUE AND WE KNOW THAT THE STATE'S HOMELESS POPULATION SUFFERS A PORTION OF IT FROM SOME FORM OF MENTAL ILLNESS. AND BUT I DON'T WE HAVE A LOT OF DEBT OF THE STATE DOESN'T RIGHT NOW WHAT THAT IS. AND IT IS WE KNOW I WAS A FORMER JAIL COMMANDER HER SECOND COUNTY WITH PROPER ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE MEDICATIONS PEOPLE NOT JUST THOSE THAT ARE THERE HOUSING AND- CHRISTIAN FACILITIES CAN DESTABILIZE A MEASURE CONDITIONS. BUT A FORCING THE STATE MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR THIS POPULATION WHO ARE OVERLY A MEDIC CAL. OF WIND IS ONE OF THE STATE AND SPECIFICALLY DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES REQUIRE PRIOR AUTHORIZATION FOR MEDICATIONS USED TO TREAT INDIVIDUALS WITH SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS. MANY OF WHOM. ARE THE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE ON HEALTH. THANK GOODNESS SOMEONE IDEA I THINK THIS IS A VERY. QUESTION AND- AS I MENTIONED WITH THE LAUNCH OF THE- A CALIFORNIA INTERAGENCY COUNCIL CLOSER TO SAID THIS COLD ED WITH. US SECRETARY KELLY AND MYSELF- WE ARE- GOING TO. CONTINUE LOOKING AT WAYS TO- INTEGRATE NOT JUST OUR HOUSING- APPROACH BUT ALSO OF GREATER UNDERSTANDING OF THE HEALTH AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND SUPPORTS THAT ARE NECESSARY. TO ENSURE THAT INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE- EXPERIENCING- HEALTH OR MENTAL HEALTH- CHALLENGES RIGHT THAT THAT THERE IS THE RIGHT LEVEL OF SUPPORT- THE GOVERNOR SKINNER PROPOSED- BUDGET INCLUDES TWO BILLION DOLLARS- OF THE TWO BILLION DOLLARS ONE POINT FIVE BILLION WILL BE ADMINISTERED BY HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES. WITH A SPECIFIC FOCUS ON HOUSING- AND SERVICES SPECIALIZED SERVICES TO ADDRESS AND MENTAL HEALTH- AT CONCERTS IN IN IN ISSUES IN AND SO MAYBE I IT WOULD INVITE- ALSO ACTIVELY LOW TO SPEAK. FURTHER TO HOW WE'RE ALSO LOOKING TO I GATHERED- DELAYED UNTIL SEPT OVERALL THE THROUGH AND. THROUGH THE WORK OF CALYX EACH. THANK YOU SECRETARY SO COUPLE OF THAT I YOU KNOW I THINK SPEAKING MORE BROADLY ABOUT SORT OF WHAT SERVICE NEEDS AREN'T PARTICULAR JURISDICTIONS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE RECOMMEND DAHLE JURISDICTIONS AS THEY GET A STRONG UNDERSTANDING OF WHO EXACTLY THEY'RE SERVING. AND WHAT THOSE NEEDS MIGHT BE AND IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE REFERENCING YOU KNOW THE PROPORTION OF PEOPLE WITH IN A JURISDICTION THAT MIGHT HAVE- BEHAVIORAL HEALTH- NEEDS AND WE DO ENCOURAGE THROUGH A COUPLE THINGS. ON OUR FORTHCOMING LOCAL ACTION PLANNING PROCESS REQUIRES THAT LOCAL JURISDICTIONS PROVIDE US WITH A TANGIBLE PLAN OF THE WAYS THAT THEY WILL SERVE THOSE WITHIN THEIR PARTICULAR JURISDICTIONS AND THE WAYS IN WHICH THEY WILL INTEGRATE THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND HOMELESSNESS SERVICES. AND SO I WOULD SAY YOU KNOW THAT THAT WOULD BE A CANNIBAL WAY THAT WE CAN START TO ADDRESS THIS QUESTION IN A MEANINGFUL WAY BUT AGAIN AS OUR SECRETARY STATED. I'M AYE AYE I WOULD DEFER TO OUR HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES PARTNERS TO PROVIDE A MORE ROBUST ANSWER AS AS- I I'M NOT A I'M NOT AN EXPERT A BEHAVIOR HEALTH SERVICES SO THANK YOU SURE AND IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT THIS IS AN ONGOING PROBLEM TO GET OUR ARMS WRAPPED AROUND AND- THAT'S THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE THE PUBLIC IS HOMELESSNESS THAT IS. I'VE SEEN THE POLLS PEOPLE CONCERNED ABOUT IT AND EXPECT GOVERNMENT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT BUT THE PROBLEM IS THERE'S NO ADULT IN THE ROOM SAYING HEY. THESE FOLKS CAN'T CARE FOR THEMSELVES WE NEED TO CARE FOR THEM YOU HAVE ON PEOPLE IF YOU FEEL YOU THAT WOULD PREFER TO HAVE SOMEONE OUT WALKING AROUND AND CLOSED. IN 32 DEGREES WEATHER THEN DO A CONSERVATORSHIP ON THEM AT SOME POINT WE HAVE TO HAVE AN ADULT THE ROOM AND SAID HEY LOOK WE'RE GONNA TAKE CARE OF THESE PEOPLE AND REALLY DO IT. AND FOR THE HOUSING STUFF ON THE HOMELESSNESS- ON HAL'S IT'S BEEN VERY VERY HEAVY ON HOUSING AND THEY TALK ABOUT REFERENCE SERVICES BUT WRAPAROUND SERVICES ARE LIGHT.

ABSOLUTELY I'M HCV HAVE BEEN- RECENTLY ENDED IN THE LAST YEAR- CREATING A DEDICATED DATA PORTAL ON OUR WEBSITE YOU WILL FIND- INTERESTING- AT THE AT IMPORT RELATED DATA ON A NUMBER OF PROGRAMS- NO PLACE LIKE HOME- CERTAINLY ARE HUNKY PROGRAM I MENTIONE- TODAY THAT AS OF THIS MORNING AND WE HAVE A LIVE DASHBOARD- WE HELP YOU LOOK AT IT IT SHOULD SHOWS AND A NUMBER OF INDICATORS IN TERMS OF HOW THE HOME KEY PROGRAM IS DEVELOPING TWO TYPES OF. THE NEEDS THAT IS CREATING OUT FOR WHOM- AND SO WE- WE HAVE- A NUMBER OFF- INDICATORS IMPACT RELATED INDICATORS FROM THE VETERANS PROGRAM TO NO PLACE LIKE HOME TO OUR FEDERAL PROGRAMS.

MAKE SURE TO FOLLOW UP WITH THE MEMBERS OF BOTH COMMITTEES TO RECEIVE THAT INFORMATION FOR DATA EVALUATION THANK YOU. MISS LOW WHAT IS THE WAS THE STATE PREVIOUSLY COORDINATING IN RESPONSE ACROSS AGENCIES TO HOMELESSNESS PRIOR TO CREATING WHAT WE NOW CALL. A CAL I SEE AGE. OR WHAT IS NOW CAL I C. H. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION- WE IN OUR- IN OUR- EXISTENCE AS THE HOMELESS COORDINATING AND FINANCING COUNCIL DID PLACE SIGNIFICANT GROUND- THE ACTUAL PLAN FOR PREVENTING AND ENDING HOMELESSNESS FOR EXAMPLE WHICH WAS ESTABLISHED LAST YEAR THROUGH A VERY ROBUST I'M STAKEHOLDER INPUT PROCESS BOTH WITH OUR LOCAL PARTNERS ACROSS OUR STATE ENTITIES AND- ADVOCATES AND RESEARCHERS WAS ESTABLISHED PRIOR TO THE LAUNCH OF CAL ICIJ FOR EXAMPLE. I WILL SAY THAT THE WORK THAT WE DO NOW BECAUSE OF THE INTEGRATION- OF OUR HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES PARTNERS WITH- OUR OUR AGENCY DOES ENABLE JUST TO GREATER- FOR LACK OF BETTER TERM REACH AND ABILITY TO COORDINATE AND PARTNER I THINK OUR CULTURE STRUCTURE- WHICH WAS I BELIEVE THIS SORT OF IMPETUS FOR THAT BILL- ENABLES US TO BETTER COORDINATE OUR WORK AND SO I WOULD SAY. WHILE THAT EXISTED WE CONTINUE TO MAKE PROGRESS. AND IMPROVE THE WAYS WE CAN DO SO. AND THANK YOU JUST A FOLLOW UP. WHAT IS THE- OF CAL I CA IN COORDINATING THE STATE RESPONSE TO HOMELESSNESS AND ARE THERE OPPORTUNITIES TO COORDINATE. AND STREAMLINE THOSE PROGRAMS ACROSS AGENCIES. AND I THINK THE VISION OF WHERE WE ARE IT'S THE VISION OF WHERE CAL ICY H. AS HAD IT IS THAT WE- BRING FORTH A CONTINUUM OF SERVICES AND CHARITIES THAT WORK. AND THAT'S VERY BROADLY SPEAKING AS VISION TEND TO BE- BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE I'M CONTINUE TO DO IS TO USE OUR ACTION PLAN FOR PREVENTING ENDING PREVENTING AND ENDING HOMELESSNESS. THROUGH THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO HELP US THINK THROUGH HOW THE FOURTEENTH STATE DEPARTMENTS CAN CONTRIBUTE ACTIONS AND- WORK TOGETHER TO COORDINATE A BETTER RESPONSE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK HAS BEEN MADE VERY CLEAR- THROUGH THE QUESTIONS IN THE COMMENTS MADE IN THIS- PARTICULAR HEARING IS THAT- HOMELESSNESS IS A MULTI FACETED ISSUE. AND THERE IS NO ONE SOLUTION AND THERE IS NO ONE PERSON EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS AND DO WE VERY MUCH BELIEVE THAT. ON THE ROAD TO INCREASE COORDINATION HAS TO DO WITH SHARED GOVERNANCE SHARED WORK AND- THAT'S SORT OF A SHARED VENUE TO BE ABLE TO. TO MAKE DECISIONS AROUND WHERE WHERE WE HEAD NEXT I DO THINK THINGS LIKE THE HOMELESS DATA INTEGRATION SYSTEM WHICH TO PROVIDE THE DATA TO ENABLE US TO ENABLE US TO. OUR ANSWERED INTO THE STATUS OF OUR EFFORTS AND HOPE WAS PROJECT OUR FUTURE EFFORTS WILL BE CRITICAL IN THAT WORK. I ALSO APPLIED AGAIN THE HAP MOBILE ACTION PLANS I'M WE YOU'RE- HAVE BEEN SAYING WE DON'T THINK OF IT AS THE HAPPY LOCAL ACTION PLAN WE THINK OF IT AS A LOCAL ACTION PLAN. THAT JURISDICTIONS WILL BE WORKING ACROSS THEIR PARTICULAR SYSTEMS. TO BE ABLE TO FULLY INTEGRATE. THANK YOU MISTER LUCKY. YEAH JUST REAL QUICKLY I WOULD LIKE TO- BELLA THE REMARK BY MY COLLEAGUE SAN AND PURSUE. ACT IN OUR I THAT THAT IS A- LONG AND COMING AND I AND I LOOK FORWARD TO. THOSE CONSIDERATIONS BUT I HAD JUST ONE. REALLY BURNING QUESTION WHICH OF THE- THE RECENT ROUTE OF FUNDED PROGRAMS SERVE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE INCAPABLE OF ASKING FOR HELP. LET'S TO ANYBODY ON THE PANEL PROGRAMS ARE DESIGNED DIRECTLY TO US SERVE THOSE WHO ARE INCAPABLE OF ASKING FOR HELP. I'M HAPPY TO TAKE THAT QUESTION- SO I THINK YOU'RE REFERRING TO PROGRAMS THAT MAY SERVE THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NEEDS OF PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS AND AGAIN- I WOULD DIRECT. BUT COME WITH BROADER INTERPRETATION OF MY QUESTION I DON'T MEAN TO CUT YOU OFF. BUT I'M VERY SPECIFICALLY TARGETING. A GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT ARE QUITE LARGE- AND I JUST WONDER AT IS THERE A PROGRAM DESIGNED TO REACH THAT POPULATION. THAT'S A VERY DIRECT QUESTION. AND AGAIN I WOULD I WOULD SAY THEY'RE HOPEFUL THAT OUR PARTNERS AT HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES TO DO OVERSEE THE BEHAVIOR HEALTH CONTINUUM WOULD BE BEST EQUIPPED TO PROVIDE AN ANSWER TO THAT. OKAY THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. I GUESS NOT OKAY- I WANT TO THANK THE PANEL AND I KNOW MISTER KING AS QUESTIONS TOO BUT I JUST HAVE TO- I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'LL SAW ON THE SACRAMENTO BEE- EDITORIAL BOARD- AT EDWARD OPINION TODAY- DISCUSSING THE CHALLENGES OF COORDINATING HOMELESSNESS SERVICES- AT LEAST IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY THERE ARE SIXTY ONE DISTINCT ACCESS POINTS FOR HUNDRED FOURTEEN DIFFERENT PROGRAMS IN THE REGION. WHICH MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT TO NAVIGATE FOR OUR AND HOUSED FOLKS IN OUR COMMUNITY AND SACRAMENTO IS TRYING TO WITH THE LEADERSHIP OF JAIL STEINBERG LEAD THE WAY HERE FOR WHAT A SINGLE POINT OF ACCESS SINGLE POINT OF ENTRY FOR FOLKS WHO NEED SERVICES- YOU KNOW WE DISCUSSED HERE  THINK THE CHALLENGES AROUND COORDINATING SERVICES- TUTTO I ANY OF THE PANELISTS YOU KNOW WHAT CAN THE STATE DO TO HELP ENSURE THE SERVICE SERVICES ARE BEING COORDINATED ON THE GROUND THAT ACCESSING THESE. BENEFITS AND RESOURCES ARE MADE EASY BY FOLKS WHO NEED IT- AND THEN WE ARE COORDINATING EFFECTIVELYLOCALLY AND FOR THOSE WHO NEED CARE. CHAIRWOMAN AT ALL- STARTED IN AND- IN THE DEFINITELY WENT ASK JULIAN AND- POSSIBLE THEY HAVE ADDITIONAL REMARKS BIT. IN A I CAN THINK THROUGH VERY IMPORTANT DRAW- THAT WEEK. TO PROVIDE THE LEVEL OF- VISION AND CLARITY IN TERMS OF THAT THE STATE'S- OVER ARCHING GOALS AS WE INVEST- HOMELESSNESS FUNDING BUT THAT WE ALSO PROVIDE THE LEVEL OF- JACKSON BUILDING AT THE- LEVEL TO HAVE CITIES AND COUNTIES AND COMMUNITIES- I UNDERSTAND THE POSITION THAT THEY'RE SERVING IN PRIORITIZE- THE BILL'S DOLLARS TO INSURE. THAT ADULTS DOLLARS OR AND MEETING THE PRIORITIES ESTABLISHED BY THE COMMUNITY ENHANCE- WHY IT'S BEEN VERY IMPORTANT TO PROVIDE THAT HOMELESS HOUSING ASSISTANCE- PROGRAM FUNDS FLEXIBLE EIGHT TO CITIES AND COUNTIES AND CONTINUE ON. OUR END ANALYSTS YOU KNOW- SHOULD BE MENTIONED- THE ONGOING SUPPORT THAT WE'RE PROVIDING TO LOCAL COMMUNITIES AT TO DEVELOP A COMPREHENSIVE LOCAL ACTION PLANS- THAT GET TO A ADDRESSING SOME OF THE GAPS IN SERVICE DELIVERY THAT WE SEE IN SOME COMMUNITIES. SO AT I THANK YOUNG DEFINITELY THINK THAT- AND- SACRAMENTO IN THEIR APPROACH- IN THE WORK THAT THEY'RE DOING. IS IN APPROACH- IN THE SERVICE DELIVERY- EFFORT THAT WE WOULD WANT TO LEARN MORE ABOUT AND ALSO LIFT UP TO SHARE WITH OTHER- COMMUNITIES- BUT- AGAIN I THINK YOU'RE REINFORCING THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING A COUNTY LOCAL- COMMUNITIES TAKE MORE OF THE OWNERSHIP IN THE LEADERSHIP FOR- AND DETERMINING. WHAT THOSE SERVICE DELIVERY SYSTEMS BOOKMARK ARE IN AT THE STATE AB WITH BEING AT THE TOP DOLLARS- THREE POINT NO AND FOR NO WE ARE ACTUALLY AND THOSE EFFORTS ARE MOVING TO NEW ON SIX HI INDICATORS THAT- HELP US BETTER GAUGE AND THE OF IN THE- FOR EXAMPLE THAT ARE EXTRA HOME. AND INTO HOW. AND THE NUMBER OF IN THE- THAT ARE- NOT YOU KNOW RE ENTERING THE HOMELESSNESS SYSTEM FOR EXAMPLE. AND SO IN A JULIET IF YOU'D LIKE TO ADD ANY ADDITIONAL DETAILS. SO I WOULD AGREE WITH ONE THING THAT WILL FLAG AS I'M AWARE THAT THE LOCAL THE FEDERAL LAW PROVIDE IS TO FOLLOW OURS AND I WOULD- NOTHING I KNOW I DON'T WANT ANSWER THE QUESTION I DO THINK THAT THEY MIGHT BE. MORE APPROPRIATELY TO SORT OF TALK THROUGH WHAT INDIVIDUAL AND SYSTEMS NEED I THINK THIS DOES FIND A COUPLE THINGS THAT WE OFTEN LIKE TO SHARE WHICH IS EVERY COMMUNITY IS GOING TO BE VERY DIFFERENT THAN THE WAY THE RESOURCES COME TOGETHER NEED TO SHOOT BUT THE PURPOSE AND NEED ABOUT PARTICULAR COMMUNITY. WE HAVE THE STATE ESPECIALLY COUNY SEAT STAND AT THE READY TO SUPPORT OUR LOCAL PARTNERS WITH REPROGRAMMING FUNDS IF IT IS ABOUT- OTHER RESOURCES FOR EXAMPLE BUT WE DO BELIEVE THAT THAT IS A LOCAL DECISION. TO BE MADE BY THOSE WHO ARE. THE DIRECTLY IN CHARGE OF THE SERVICE. WITHIN AT CHURCH. IF I JUST MAY ADEQUATE BECAUSE YOUR- GERMAN H. A WOMAN AT WHICH YOUR YOUR QUESTION WAS CAN'T CAN'T WHAT CAN THE STATE DO WELL IN THE- DIDN'T. INFRSTR THE WAY IN WHICH JURISDICTIONS PROVIDE. INTO SERVICES FOR THE HOMELESS IS VERY MUCH A LOCAL DECISION BUT- AT A AYE I INTERPRET THAT QUESTION- INTERNALIZE THAT QUESTION AS AN H. C. V. AS SERIOUS THE PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE. TO SUPPORT LOCAL JURISDICTIONS REALLY ABOUT THE FLEXIBILITY WHEN THESE PROGRAMS ARE CREATED ARE WE NEED THE INTENT OF THE LEGISLATURE- WIFE'S FUNKY BANDS SUCH A SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM THAT'S BEEN DEPLOYING. YOU KNOW EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN RECORD TIME AND RECORD COST BECAUSE OF THE FLEXIBILITY IN WHICH THE PROGRAM WAS DESIGNED TODAY IS MONDAY WAS ON AN ARTICLE IN POLITICAL ABOUT VERY SIMILAR PROGRAM. AND THAT THE STATE OF NEW YORK TRIED TO IMPLEMENT IT HASN'T IT HASN'T M. EVEN PROVIDE AT AB M. A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN FUNDING ONLY ONE APPLICATION WAS RECEIVED BY THE STATE OF NEW YORK AS AT CONTRARY TO NEARLY SEVEN THOUSAND UNITS EE I HAVE ALREADY CREATED UNDER CLUNKY HERE IN CALIFORNIA. THE ANSWER IS SIMPLE FLEXIBILITY FLEXIBILITY THAT TE CONCORD PROGRAM ALLOWS FOR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS- FOR THE STATE TO MEET LOCAL JURISDICTIONS WHERE THEY ARE AND THE COMMUNITIES WHERE THEY ARE I THINK THAT'S JUST THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT I THINK ROLE. AS A STATE WE CAN'T MADAM CHAIR JUST WANTED. START WITH A C. Q. THROUGH ALL MY NUMBER HERE AGO YOU ISSUES REGARDING- VACANCY AND SORT OF WAY YOU'RE AT- YOU KNOW WE ARE HEAD COUNT IS NOW IN WHERE YOUR FAITH ARE NOW. YEAH WE A AYE THANK YOU FOR THAT. IS MEMBER WE MEDICAL MILES. AT THE END OF- YEAR WEBER WE WERE VERY. TO HAVE THIS STATE WIDE AVERAGE- JUST APPROXIMATELY TWO THIRD NINETEEN THIRTEEN. PERCENT VACANCY RATE WELL UNDER 10% RIGHT NOW ARE WE CONSIDERING HAS GONE UP BECAUSE- A LOT OF ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO STOPPING LEVELS THAT WE HAVE TO INCREASE WE I THINK THAT WE ARE CLOSE TO SIXTEEN PERCENT. BY WE WILL NOT SEE THE DAIS AT BACK IN THE OLD DAYS WHERE HCV WAS CONFRONTED WITH YOU KNOW- 2530% VACANCY RATE WE WILL MAINTAIN THAT MAY CONSIDER A LINE WHAT WOULD TRACK WE'RE GOING TO TRY BY THE END OF THE YEAR TO BRING IT. BACK TO UNDER 10% THAT'S GREAT NEWS CONGRATULATIONS AND. WHAT WHAT YOUR ROUGH F. T. HOW CAN I KNOW WE'VE GROW YOUR TO QUITE IF. I QUITE A BIT OF THE LAST FEW YEARS. BOB A CHIP DAY IS HERE- SECOND I WE ARE- HUNDRED- MR ALMOST ALMOST CAN YOU VERIFY THAT I THINK AROUND TWELVE HUNDRED. YEAH WE ARE JUST A SHADE UNDER TWELVE HUNDRED RIGHT NOW- TO SOME OF THE EARLIER POINTS- SOME OF THE FEDERAL AUTHORIZATION WE GET PURPOSES OF PETITIONS FOR SOME OF OUR FEDERAL OUR RESOURCE WILL PROVIDE EXTENSIVE DON'T ALWAYS COME THE PROPOSAL ON THE SCENE. CABLES AT THE STATE THE POSITIONS IN THE BUDGET YEAR SO WE VERY RECENTLY GOT APPROVAL PERSONALLY FEDERAL POSITION SO THAT WILL GROW UP BASED ON SOME OF OUR OUR FEDERAL RESOURCES THAT SYSTEM THE ITEM. JUST BECAUSE OF SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT OUR CAPABILITIES THERE SO WE HAVE VERY MUCH FOCUSED ON THE FEDERAL SIDE TO CREATE A NEW FEDERAL BRANCH AS YOU MAY RECALL THE BEGINNING OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE IS TO EXCLUSIVELY DEAL WITH FEDERAL RESOURCES SO- AS OTHER RECOGNITION YOU KNOW WE'RE WELL ON OUR WAY TO GET THAT NUMBER BACK DOWN WE'VE BEEN QUITE PLEASED. THAT THE TALENT FRANKLY THAT WANTS TO COME WORK FOR THE STATE- IN THE INTEREST BECAUSE- I THINK PEOPLE SEE IT AS ME IN A MOMENT OF THE DISGRACING ITSELF IT'LL SO- PORTION UNDER TWELVE HUNDRED IT WILL GO UP A LITTLE BIT. ADDS UP AS NEW FEDERAL. AUTHORIZATION GREAT THANK YOU- I KNOW THIS. MISLED TALKED ABOUT. FLEXIBILITY TO A LOCAL AND THAT'S THAT. I THINK FROM YOU KNOW CA. BANKING WITH. I THINK ONE OF THE CHALLENGE. AS AB. WHILE I GUARD CURRENT WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO HAVE. TO THE CHALLENGES HAS BEEN DEVELOPING. BENCHMARKS AND MEASUREMENTS TO ENSURE THAT THE LOCALS ARE ACTUALLY- THE JUDGE ACHIEVING GOALS- WALL RECEIVING FLEXIBLE FUNDING FOR CAN YOU CAN YOU WALK ME THROUGH SOME OF THE- SOME OF THE KEY BENCHMARKS THAT YOUR AGENCIES OR MISS LOW YOU KNOW YOU'RE LOOKING AT- TO- TRACK SUCCESS ON BEHALF OF THE- ON BEHALF OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. AND THE COCS RIVER CITIES COUNTIES. YOU'RE HAPPY TO DIVE INTO THAT- I WILL SAY A COUPLE THINGS THAT WE ARE WORKING ON SIMULTANEOUSLY BOTH ENABLED BY THE LEGISLATURE FIRST IS THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE EIGHTY NINE SEVEN SEVEN WHICH EXPANDS THE NUMBER OF HOMELESSNESS PROGRAMS STATEWIDE WHICH ARE REQUIRED TO ENTER DATA INTO EACH OF MY **** WHAT THAT WILL LOOK CHEAP ON OUR END. IS THAT WILL MAKE UP WHAT IS ADHD I AS MUCH MORE COMPREHENSIVE- AND WILL BE INCLUSIVE OF I'M TO THE FULL RANGE OF HOMELESSNESS PROGRAMS THAT ARE FUNDED BY THE STATE AS YOU CAN IMAGINE AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF BUT IF THE INCREASE IN DATA AND RECORDS THAT ARE INJURED. MEANS MORE ACCURATE INFORMATION AND AGAIN- WE ARE COLLECTED. ON A QUARTERLY BASIS MENTIONS. GIVEN SIZE AND SCOPE OF PROGRAM. SAID THAT. EACH YEAR YES AND THE BECOME VERY IMPORTANT IN OUR PURSUIT OF UNDERSTANDING OUT COMES. UP FIRST WE WILL BE IMPLEMENTING WHAT ARE KNOWN AS THE SYSTEM PERFORMANCE MEASURES I THINK IN. OUR PRIVATE SECTOR THEY MIGHT CALL THEM- LEADING INDICATORS PERHAPS- AND IN THOSE SIX INDICATORS. INVOLVED EVERYTHING FROM- THE NUMBER OF PERSONS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS WITHIN A JURISDICTION. I'M TO THE NEW LENGTH OF TIME PEOPLE REMAIN HOMELESS FOR EXAMPLE. AND REDUCING THE RETURNS TO HOMELESSNESS THERE ARE SIX FOUR MEASURES THAT I'M HAPPY TO SHARE- WITH THIS COMMITTEE AND THAT WILL BE DIRECTLY TIED. TO OUR HOUSE PROGRAM AND ATTACHED TO THE HOUSE LOCAL. ACTION PLAN PROCESS. DOES NOT. ANSWER YOUR QUESTION- OUR SERVER FOR LITTLE MORE SPECIFICITY THAN THAT. SO THOSE SO THOSE SYSTEM PERFORMANCE MEASURES WILL BE USED TO SET GOALS- WHAT ROLES ESSENTIAL PRETTY COULD YOU WALK US THROUGH THE MEASURES. SURE THING. IT'S A SENSE OF HOW SUCCESSFUL YOU ARE GATHERING ANY DATA TO TRUCKERS MEASURES. SO WE CAN TRACK THOSE MEASURES NOW THROUGH THE HOMELESS DATA INTEGRATION SYSTEM. I'M THOSE SIX MEASURES ARE REDUCING THE NUMBER OF PERSONS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS REDUCING THE NUMBER OF PERSON TO BECOME HOMELESS FOR THE FIRST TIME. INCREASING THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE EXITING HOMELESS INTO PERMANENT HOUSING REDUCING THE LENGTH OF TIME PERSONS REMAIN HOMELESS. REDUCING THE NUMBER OF PERSONS TO RETURN HOMELESSNESS AFTER EXITING. INCREASING SUCCESSFUL PLACEMENTS FROM STREET OUTREACH AND ALL OF THESE GOALS WILL BE DISAGGREGATED TO IDENTIFY UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS. I DO YOU HAVE OUR GRANTS DIRECTOR VICTOR TO RUN TO TALK ABOUT WHAT THAT GOAL SETTING PROCESS WILL BE. AS I THINK YOU'RE ASKING FOR A MUCH MORE DETAILED QUESTIONS AROUND SORT OF WHAT OUR PROCESS WITH OUR PARTNERS WILL BE. WHAT WHAT IS THE BIG. I THINK THOSE BEFORE GOING TO. YOUR GRANDSON. THE GRANTS PERSON THE CYST SIX INDICATORS- SEEM TO BE VERY APPROPRIATE COULD CAN YOU WALK US THROUGH- YOU'RE THE FIRST MONTH YOU GOT A DATA SAID AND TO WHERE WE ARE NOW AND ALSO WHAT TRENDS YOU'RE SEEING WITH THE TO THOSE INDICATES TO THINK THAT'S INDICATING VERY APPROPRIATE. SO I'M GIVEN THE HIRING SORT OF THE HIGH VISIBILITY OF THESE WE ACTUALLY ARE WORKING WITH THAT VENDOR NOW. TO ASSURE BOTH- THAT WE'RE SORT OF DOING OUR DUE DILIGENCE ON THE ON THE CALCULATIONS OF THOSE AND WE WILL BE USING THEM- WE ARE CURRENTLY USING AB. SO THAT WE CAN. UNDERGO THE PLANNING PROCESS IN YOUR CD POTS BECAUSE IT'S SORT OF A BIG IT'S A BIG SIX MONTHS FOR US HERE KELLY C. H. WE ARE DUE TO SUBMIT THOSE PLANS AND THE GOALS BY I BELIEVE THE END OF JUNE AND SO WE'RE CURRENTLY UNDER WAY IN DEVELOPING BOTH THE MEASURES AND WORKING TO SCHEDULE THE APPROPRIATE MEETINGS WITH EACH OF THE SEVENTY SEVEN GRANTEES. TO THAT USE THOSE FIGURES TO SET GOALS. OKAY SO AT THIS POINT YOU'RE HAVING DATA YOU CAN SHARE WITH US. SO WE DON'T HAVE DATA UNTIL WE WILL BE SUBMITTING THE FULL PACKAGE. I'M IN THAT WILL BE A PUBLIC PROCESS BY I BELIEVE IS THE END OF JUNE. SO AFTER THE BUDGET PROCESS IS DONE. SO HOW HOW COULD WE GET DATA HEAD OF THE BUDGET PROCESS WHICH WILL HELP INFORM US OF. WHERE WE SHOULD BE SPENDING OUR MONEY. I THINK THAT MIGHT BE A DEEPER QUESTION THEN I'M PREPARED TO ANSWER NOW IN THE SENSE THAT WE DO HAVE EXISTING. DATA AROUND HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE BEING SERVED FOR EXAMPLE I WILL SAY THAT WE CONTINUE TO COLLECT DATA ON A QUARTERLY BASIS FROM OUR CEO SEES THAT START TO GIVE US. A SENSE FOR HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE BEING SERVED FIVE WE HAVE MADE THE DECISION THAT WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS ON THESE. I'M SYSTEM PERFORMANCE MEASURES BECAUSE THEY ARE THE COMMON MEASURES BUT I THINK FOLKS HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR ASKING FOR ANSWER TO DIVERT BY USING OTHER METRICS. WOULD BE YOU KNOW WOULD BE WHICH WOULD BREAK A ACTUALLY ARE INTENDED FOCUS ABUSING THE SYSTEM PERFORMANCE. MEASURES WELL PERHAPS. YEP FOR. SOMEONE ELSE WAS SENT TO THE PARTICULAR MORE THAN WELCOME TO JUMP IN. ASSEMBLY MEMBER THIS IS A LOTUS- ACOSTA FROM IT IS THAT AGENCY AND THEN IT MIGHT BE HELPFUL FOR ME TO JUST- CAN YOU TAKE A STEP BACK IN IN. IN TERMS OF. AND THAT THE PROCESS AND WEBER ATTY IN TERMS OF GETTING TO MEASURING OF THE OVERALL AND- I PROGRESS IN OUTCOMES TIED TO THE SIX MANAGERS SO THE FIRST TWO ROUNDS OF HAP FUNDS AT THAT WENT OUT TO CITIES COUNTIES AND COMMUNITIES. FRANKLY DID NOT HAVE AND THEY WERE NOT TIED TO THE SIX INDICATORS THESE WERE DOLLARS THAT WERE DISTRIBUTED. ACROSS THE STATE AND TO PROVIDE LOCAL COMMUNITIES THE GREATEST LEVEL FLEXIBILITY- STILL ASKS AND THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET WAS ADOPTED- A TWO YEAR BUDGET WITH- HISTORICALLY HIGH LEVELS OF HOMELESSNESS DOLLARS. AND THAT THE FUNDING REQUIRES THAT COMMUNITIES THAT ARE GOING TO BE SEEN HAPPEN FUNDING- GO THROUGH A LOCAL- PLANNING PROCESS TO ESTABLISH LOCAL ACTION PLANS THAT ARE DUE TO THE STATE BY THE END OF JUNE OF THIS YEAR. AND THOSE LOCAL ACTION PLANS MUST DESCRIBE THE SIX INDICATORS AND THE GOALS THAT THEY'RE ESTABLISHING. AND HOW ALL THIS WILL BE UTILIZED. ONCE THOSE PLANS ARE SUBMITTED TO THE STATE OR TEAM WILL BE ASSESSING- THE PLANS OF ASSESSING AT THE- HOW REASONABLE THESE GOALS ARE. AND THEN ALSO USING THE DATA THAT WE HAVE- GATHERED AND COLLECTED IN AND FRANKLY AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER I WOULD SAY THAT. WE ARE IN MANY WAYS OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS PLAYING SORT OF CATCH UP FOR DEVELOPING INFRASTRUCTURES IN THE SYSTEMS. OUT TO ENSURE NOT ONLY THAT THERE'S GREATER COORDINATION BUT THAT WERE ALSO GATHERING THE DATA- THAT WILL HELP INFORM HOW DOLLARS ARE BEING SPENT WHAT STRATEGIES AND SERVICES AND SOLUTIONS ARE EFFECTIVE OR NOT EFFECTIVE. AND THEN ALSO CONNECTING THOSE INVESTMENTS AND THE SOLUTIONS TO WHAT THE FEDERAL FUNDING- AT THE END OF THE FUNDING COMING FROM HI THROUGH EITHER VOUCHERS ESG- YOU NAME RIGHT. AND SO. I THINK THAT ONE OF THE REAL- WE'RE NOT AT A POINT OF BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE CONCRETE DATA IN TERMS OF THE SIX INDICATORS IS BECAUSE WE ARE CURRENTLY MOVING THE SYSTEM TO ENSURE THAT BILL SIX INDICATORS BECOME THE WAY OF MEASURING- PERFORMANCE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. BUT WE DO HAVE IN THE BILL YOU KNOW WHAT THE- PLACE TO FOLLOW UP AND ENSURE THIS WITH YOUR YOUR OFFICE ONE WE DO HAPPEN NOW IS THE HOMELESS DATA INTEGRATION SYSTEM THAT IS- BASICALLY A COLLECTION OF DATA FROM FORTY FOUR CONTINUE ONCE THE PROCESS STATE. THAT IS CENTRALLY AGREED TO SHARE THIS DATA WITH THE STATE THE STATE IT ABLE SAYS TO UNDERSTAND. WHO THESE CONTINUOUS ARE STARTING ON THE TYPES OF SERVICES THAT ARE BEING PROVIDED AND THE TYPES OF EXITS OUT OF THE SYSTEM OR. OR THE TYPES OF- INTRIGUED THIS. AND NOT AB SHOULD NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE THE STATE THIS IS THE FIRST. THAT THE STATE HAS A COMPREHENSIVE VIEW OF WHAT IS HAPPENING ACROSS THE STATE WHEN IT COMES TO HOMELESSNESS. WHEN IT COMES TO OUR HOMELESSNESS RESPONSE SYSTEM AND THAT THE DISPATCH AND HELP SORT OF PROVIDE CONTEXT AND ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS NO IT IF IT DOESN'T HAPPEN I APPRECIATE THAT NIGHT OF DEFINITELY PLUG YOU IN YOUR AGENCY ON THE- THE H. T. I. S. DATABASE I THINK THAT'S A GREAT FIRST STEP PICKING. CAN YOU GIVE ME A SENSE OF WHAT. DATA YOU'VE BEEN ABLE TO COLLECT IN H. D. I. S. A WHEN IT'S WHEN IT'S TELLING US. JULIE DO YOU WANT TO GO AHEAD AND GO THROUGH SOME OF THE DATA. SURE THING SO WHAT IS- COLLECTED IN THE GCIS. R. ONE I'M COME FROM LOCAL HOMELESS MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM AND THEY'RE KNOWN AS OUR- UNIVERSAL ELEMENTS INTO THOSE INCLUDE DATA THAT ARE TAKEN IN. AT AT THE TIME MR WHEN SERVICES ARE PROVIDED TO PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS THE SORT OF DATA THAT WE HAVE OUR- THE- DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS OF THOSE WHO WERE BEING SERVED- THE- THEY CALL THEM PROJECTS BUT ESSENTIALLY THE TYPES OF SERVICES. THAT PEOPLE- ARE UTILIZING INCLUDING- OUTREACH- TEMPORARY SHELTER AND. PERMANENT HOUSING FOR EXAMPLE. N WITH THAT IS SORT OF A PRIVATE OF HOW WHEN THEY MIGHT HAVE SOUGHT SERVICES WHERE THEY MAKE NOT WHERE THEY THOUGHT THERE RISEN IN TERMS OF JURISDICTIONS. I'M AS WELL AS SORT OF A- A TREND OVER TIME WE ARE COLLECTING DATA FROM TWENTY EIGHTEEN ON AND WE CONTINUE TO REFRESH DATA ON A QUARTERLY BASIS. THAT'S GREAT TO HEAR CAF DATA STARTING IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WHAT WHAT WHAT TRENDS ARE YOU. SAYING SO SOMETIMES LIKE PRIMARILY THE DATA IS. DEMOGRAPHIC AND SURVEYS AND ABOUT THE SERVICE IS BEING SOUGHT GOT IT AND IN THAT THERE'S NOT AS MUCH SO I WOULD SAY- ARE YOU ABLE TO DETERMINE SORT OF HOW. HOW HOW LONG PEOPLE HAVE BEEN HOMELESS- SORT OF CAUSE AND EFFECT WHAT WHAT PUT THEM OUT THERE DO YOU ARE YOU SEEING. THE DEMOGRAPHICALLY WHAT TRENDS ARE YOU SAYING WITHIN THAT WITHIN THAT DATA SET. HELLO AND I'LL DISTINGUISH TWO THINGS SO AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. AND FUTURE RESTRICTION WILL COLLECT DATA ABOVE AND BEYOND WHAT IS TRANSMITTED TO THE STATE- AND SO WITHOUT ANY JURISDICTION SAN FRANCISCO FOR EXAMPLE MAIN COLLECT MOVED FAR MORE ROBUST AND I'M I'M LIKE I'M SURE THEY- I WOULD GUESS THEY ARE- THAT WE DON'T HAVE TRANSMITTED TO US AND THAT'S- PARTIALLY- SO THAT WE CAN HAVE A STANDARDIZED SYSTEM ACROSS THE STATE AS YOU CAN IMAGINE WHAT LOCAL SPECIFY. LIKE SORT OF SPECIFIC DATA TO LOCAL JURISDICTION MY VERY ACROSS THE FORTY FOR CONTINUANCE OF CARE. WHAT WE ARE SEEING- IS SORT OF THAT THE TREND THAT I THINK THIS IS WELL IT'S SORT OF WELL DOCUMENTED AND ROUND WELL RECOGNIZED AROUND. THE RACIAL DISPARITIES AMONG- THOSE. RACIAL SUBGROUPS THAT ARE OVER REPRESENTED COMPARED TO THE POPULATION AT HOLD ON ON A WHOLE- THE SWORDS- THE DEMOCRAT GRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS OF THOSE SEEKING SERVICES. AND AT THE DATA DEMONSTRATED ANYWHERE WITHIN BAY PROGRESS. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK IS WHY WE ARE SO EAGER FOR THE SYSTEM PERFORMANCE MEASURES AS I THINK YOU KNOW AT THE DATA PERSON AND IN FORMALLY I WAS RESEARCHER SORT OF WHAT HOW DO WE DEFINE PROGRESS- IS WHAT WE ARE DEALING WITH NOW WHICH IS AROUND THE SYSTEM PERFORMANCE MEASURES SO WE ARE EAGER. TO GET THOSE OUT WE ARE EAGER TO TEND TO ESTABLISH THEM AND TO COMMUNICATE THEM IN A VERY CLEAR WAY SO PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THEM. GOT A TOP OFFICER CRITTER THIS SO WITHOUT THE- DATA. WITHOUT BROAD AGREEMENT AS TO HOW WE CAN DETERMINE PROGRESS HOW WOULD YOU ADVISE US. TO LOOK AT THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY HOMELESSNESS PROPOSAL BECAUSE IT DOESN'T- YOU KNOW I KNOW HE'S FRUSTRATED I KNOW THE LEGISLATURE'S FRUSTRATED THE PUBLIC'S FRUSTRATED- WE HAVE APPROPRIATE- BILLIONS I FEEL LIKE CARL SAGAN WITH APPROPRIATE BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO THIS ISSUE. AND IT'S NOT CLEAR WHERE WE'VE MADE. PROGRESS SO WHAT ADVICE WOULD YOU GIVE TO US AND HOW TO EVALUATE THE JANUARY PROPOSAL BASED ON- LACK OF BENCHMARKS- BUT A LOT OF. FRUSTRATION. THE. THURMOND SECRETARY SO THERE. JEREMY IT'S WRITTEN OKAY. YOU'RE YOU'RE STILL ON MUTE SECRETARY. OKAY THERE WE GO I APOLOGIZE NOT AT ALL AND- YES THAT SOON ASSEMBLY MEMBER WHEN I WOULD SAY IS THE FOLLOWING SO H. C. A. S. OF LET'S SAY THE REGRESSION SYSTEM IS A VERY IMPORTANT TOOL IN TERMS OF GATHERING INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING ACROSS THE STATE. WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE OVER A HUNDRED AND SIXTY THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS WE ALSO KNOW THAT WE HAVE NEARLY TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN SERVED BY THESE CONTINUE IT'S ACROSS THE BOARD AND- WE ARE AWARE OF THE TYPES OF SERVICES THAT THEY'RE ACCESSING AND SO THAT HELPED US. OF BATTERY AND- THE BILL INFORMED OF THE- OF NOT JUST INVEST IN HOUSE BUT ALSO CAN. TO INVEST IN HUMAN SERVICES AND HEALTH SERVICES THIS IS WHY- THIS IS. A CRITICAL PILLAR OF THE GOVERNOR'S HOMELESSNESS BUDGET TWO BILLION DOLLARS TO FURTHER HOUSING HUMAN SERVICES AND HEALTH. OF THE TWO BILLION DOLLARS THERE'S FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS THAT HAS BEEN ALLOCATED FOR EXPRESS TEAM ENCAMPMENTS RESOLUTION- REALLY ADDRESSING ENCAMPMENTS- THAT ARE- UNSAFE- AND NOT DIGNIFIED- PLACES OF LIVING. OUT THIS YEAR WE LAUNCHED UP FOR THE FIRST TIME THE INCUMBENT RESOLUTION GRANDMOTHER BROWN. LOOK WE'VE WE'VE ALL READ THE BUDGET PROPOSAL WE'RE INTIMATELY FAMILIAR WITH ANYONE FAMILIAR WITH THE LAST COUPLE YEARS I GUESS. HOW WOULD YOU. ASK US TO EVALUATE. THE JANUARY. PROPOSAL WHICH IS BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE- WHICH WILL HAVE TO EVALUATE- WITHOUT UNDERSTAND. WE'RE WE'RE HAVING SUCCESS WHAT'S WORKING. AND WHAT'S NOT FOR SURE PERHAPS WE JUST HOLD THIS. BUDGET ITEM OVER THE NEXT YEAR TO WE HAVE MORE DATA. THAT'S AN OPTION TO. YEAH EIGHT I WOULD SAY- ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND- I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO EVALUATE HOW WE'RE DOING AS A STATE IMPLEMENTING THE FUNDS THAT WERE ALLOCATED IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. HOW ARE WE GETTING DOLLARS OUT TO BUILD MORE HOUSING AND THAT INCLUDES A COMPLETE IN JUST THREE MONTHS WE'VE AWARDED A THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS TO PRODUCE FOUR HUNDRED UNITS. WHEN I WOULD SAY ALSO IS- HOW ARE YOU DOING AS A STATE AND SETTING UP THE SYSTEMS OF ACCOUNTABILITY AND ARE WE MAKING PROGRESS TOWARDS THAT END I'M GOOD AT IT I WOULD SAY THAT AND WE'RE IN THE MIDST F YOU KNOW CONTINUING TO BUILD A SYSTEM. AND YOU KNOW THAT THE- YEAR POINT ASSEMBLY MEMBER THAT I WOULD MAKE IN TERMS OF HOW THE EVALUATE THE PROPOSAL. IS- MANY LOOKING AT WHETHER THAT THE TWO BILLION DOLLARS THAT IS BETTER THAN THE BUDGET RIGHT- IF THESE ARE THE TOP PRIORITIES WE BELIEVE THAT THESE ARE THE PRIORITIES- THAT. COMMUNITIES ARE. ADDRESSING THE GRAPPLING WITH. IN THAT WILL BE BUILT ON THE PRIORITIES THAT WE'VE ESTABLISHED TOGETHER WITH THE LEGISLATURE IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO THROUGH. FOR THE OVERALL- CALIFORNIA COME BACK THE PLAN. OKAY- BUT I GUESS. WHAT WOULD BE HELPFUL IS UNDERSTANDING- WHAT WHAT WE ANTICIPATE AND I THINK THAT'S PART OF A DISCUSSED AND I THINK THAT'S PART OF OUR DISCUSSION BETWEEN BETWEEN NOW AND JUNE IS WHAT WE ANTICIPATE BEING ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH BASED ON THAT. FUNDING. SO I THINK THAT'S THE PART THAT'S NOT. CLEAR. SO ON. I AM NOT I'M GLAD YOU MENTIONED HOME KILLS LAST QUESTION ABOUT HOME KEY- I GUESS BASED ON THE STAFF ANALYSIS IS SAYS I'M SORRY THIS IS FOR ROOM KEY- THAT THERE WERE APPROXIMATELY FOURTEEN THOUSAND. SEVEN HUNDRED ROOMS WHICH WERE SECURED BY ROOM K. THAT SOUND APPROXIMATELY RIGHTS STATEWIDE. CAN YOU REPEAT THAT NUMBER- BUSHER I HAVE BEEN IN THE STAFF ANALYSIS ON PAGE FOUR. IT SAYS THAT APPROXIMATELY FOURTEEN THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED ROOMS WERE SECURED BY ROOM K. THAT SOUNDS RIGHT. NOT JUST A PROBABLY RIGHT IN AND- I'LL JUST LIKE THAT WE WORK WITH BIG RECEIVER CORRECTION OUR PARTNERS AT THE IT SAYS IT WAS CLOSER TO SIXTEEN THOUSAND JUST OVER SIXTEEN THOUSAND. GOT IT OKAY I'M SORRY THANK YOU STOP JUST GIVE ME THE REVISED NUMBER SIXTEEN THOUSAND. FOR SEVEN- IT IS SAID THAT THE 73% ARE OCCUPIED. THAT IS THE PROGRAM IN AUGUST YEAH THANK YOU- HOW WE DOING ON OUR DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES ASSEMBLYMEMBERS YOU NOT MINISTERS THE ROOM GIVE THE PARLIAMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES AND I THINK I HEARD YOU SAY THAT WITH THE WAR A CHOIR BUT I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY THAT THE WOULD BE ROOM KEEP PROGRAM WAS BASED ON- THE- AT LEAST SAYS- AT. IT WAS WAS LEASING REFORMS FOR QUICK ACCESS SUPPORT EXPRESS. GAGA IT AND THEN FIFTY THANK YOU FOR THINK IT FOR THE CRAFT CARE. SO- IT SAID THAT SO 3% OF THOSE ARE OCCUPIED AND I THINK I THINK MISS. MISS LOW MENTIONED. SO AGAIN DSS ADMINISTERS THESE PROGRAMS BUT WHAT I WHAT THEY PROVIDED IN TERMS OF INFORMATION ON THIS A 73% WERE OCCUPIED AT THE HEIGHT OF THE PROGRAM IN AUGUST TWENTY TWENTY. OKAY SO WHERE WHERE WE WITH OCCUPANCY TODAY. I WOULD SAY A COUPLE THINGS I WOULD DEFERRED TO RDS ASK PARTNERS TO PROVIDE SORT OF AN UPDATE ON WHERE ON WHAT OCCUPANCY LEVELS ARE. I AM AWARE THAT THEY YOU KNOW THEY'RE THEY'RE GOING TO BE BASED ON UP THAT PROGRAM SO QUICKLY- AND SORT OF TO YOUR EARLIER POINT ABOUT WHAT WAS ACHIEVED YOU KNOW IT WAS. THAT MANY PEOPLE BIG HOUSE DURING A PANDEMIC AND SO I THINK YOU KNOW THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY CONTINUE TO DO WORK ACT AND I DON'T WANT TO ANSWER ON THE BEHALF BUT I WILL SAY THAT. I THINK I'M A THEY WOULD YOU WOULD DEFINITELY HAVE TO CHECK WITH THEM ON I THINK THEY WOULD BEST ADDRESS THAT QUESTION BUT- ALSO. SECOND MAC I THINK. SORT OF THE FLUID NATURE OF WHO'S IN AND WHO'S OUT ON ANY GIVEN DAY IS YOU KNOW IT IS JUST ONE OF THE COMPLEXITY OF ALMOST ONE OF THE COMPLEXITIES OF THE START OF THE STATE OF THE FLUID NATURE OF HOMELESSNESS. ON ANY GIVEN DAY. NO NO UNDERSTOOD THAT BUT BUT AGAIN IT SEEMS- YOU KNOW WE HAVE WE HAVE UNITS WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO BE IN UNITS AND WE'RE JUST TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT. I'M JUST TRYING UNDERSTAND WHY THERE'S EMPTY UNITS. IT IS SOMETHING THAT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE NOT ABLE TO ANSWER AND ANSWER THE QUESTIONS WILL HAVE TO ADDRESS AT. A DIFFERENT HEARING. THAT WAS OUR FIRST SIR ASSEMBLY MEMBER AYE AYE. WHEN I MAKE SURE YEAH YOU'RE NOT REFERRING TO THE HOME KEEP PROGRAM YOU YOU STARTED TALKING ABOUT POSITION OF UNITS WELL I WAS GOING TO GET THE HOME KEY I JUST STARTED WITH ROOM HERE BUT I'M HAPPY TO DO. OF UP. HI FORGET LIKE WITH- I GUESS WITH HOME KIT AND YOU COULD MAYBE YOU COULD TALK ABOUT DIRECTOR JUST YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR- WHAT YOU'RE VACANCY RATE IS I DID HAVE A QUESTION WHICH I HOPE I HEARD YOU CORRECTLY THAT WITH THE- NO PLACE LIKE HOME. WITH THE ONE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLAR ALLOCATION IT WAS ABOUT THIRTEEN THOUSAND UNITS. RIGHT AND IS THAT WITH WITH THAT ONE POINT THREE BILLION SPENT ONLY ON THE UNITS OR WAS IT ALSO A SPENT ON SERVICES OF ALL. THAT INCLUDES AT ABOUT NOT IS THE MEASUREMENT OF UNITS THAT WILL BE CREATED BY THIS PROGRAM BUT AS YOU KNOW. THE NO PLACE LIKE HOME- HAS A VERY ROBUST- OPTION FOR CAPITALIZE OPERATING RESERVES- UP TO TWENTY YEARS FOR THESE UNITS TO BE- PROPERLY YOU KNOW SERVED A YOU KNOW THESE THESE ARE UNITS THAT SERVE. PERSONS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS THAT HAD EXPERIENCE HOMELESS HOMELESSNESS IT WITH MENTAL ILLNESS SO THE INTENSE NATURE OF THE SERVICES AVAILABLE FOR THESE RESIDENTS- HE'S IS VERY STRONG SO WE IT IT IS THE- IT IS ONE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS THAT. INCLUDES AB BOTH UNITS IN OPERATIONS OF. PERFECT FOR A QUICK FOR THAT BECAUSE I THINK THAT MAKES THAT NUMBER MAKES SENSE IF IT'S CONSTRUCTION AS WELL AS YOU'RE SAYING THE PART THAT MONEY SET ASIDE IN RESERVE. LONG TERM FOR THOSE SERVICES FOR SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. THAT'S CORRECT OKAY GREAT I WELCOME YEAH- CHAPEL SHE WANTS TO BE JUST- ADD ANYTHING TO THAT. MODEL OF PERMITS SUPPORT HOUSING WERE YOU HAVING WHAT WOULD BE CALLED CAPITALIZE OPERATING SUBSIDIES- YOU AWARD THAT TIME OF THE WAR IN STRONG DOWN OVER TIME SO THAT DOES HELP SUBSIDIZE NOT ONLY OPERATIONS OF THE PROPERTY WHICH HELPS KEEP THE RUN FLOW AS WELL AS SOME OF THE SERVICES. NO PLACE LIKE HOME IS QUITE UNIQUE AS WELL BECAUSE THE COUNTIES ARE GREEN AFTER TWENTY YEARS OF PER THE STATUTE TO PROVIDE AUGMENTS SERVICES MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ON TOP OR IN CONJUNCTION WITH THAT. SO IT'S UNIQUE IN THAT WAY- OKAY ABSOLUTELY. NO PRESSURE THANK YOU AND FOR ONE FINAL NUMBER WE GOT. COMING FROM PANEL. I'M JUST GOING BACK TO KEY. I SEE SAYS THAT HOME HE'S PRODUCED ABOUT- ABOUT FIFTY NINE HUNDRED. UNISOURCE ROUGHLY SO- FOCUSED ON THAT THAT'S THE OLD NUMBER I THINK I. KNOW THAT'S A NEW NUMBER- WELL WITH. DIFFERENT IMAGES CLARIFIED THAT DIFFERS INTEGRATION OF FLUNKY HEY HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS- PROFUSE A LITTLE OVER SIX THOUSAND UNITS- AND WE ARE IN THE IMPLEMENTED THE SECOND ITERATION OF CLUNKY ONE POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS WITH JUSTICE STARTED MAKING AWARDS. A COUPLE MONTHS AGO AND THAT HAS ADDED AN ADDITIONAL TWELVE HUNDRED UNITS FOR A TOTAL OF A- YOU KNOW OVER SEVEN THOUSAND UNITS THE- ONES HOME KEY. IS AB. HELPED COMPLETELY DEPLOYED FOR HOME Q. ONE POINT ONE KEEP TO PLAN A WE ESTIMATE. OPGEN CLOSE TO SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN THOUSAND UNITS IN TOTAL AND I THINK THAT'S GREAT I THINK IT'S WONDERFUL THAT BOTH THESE PROGRAMS ROOM KEY AND HOME KEY. FOR TOTAL UP UNDER PANDEMIC WITH FEDERAL SMALL RESOURCES IT'S A IT'S- AMAZING FEAT- MY QUESTION WHICH IS GOING BACK TO THE VACANCY WAS THE PROXIMATE VACANCY FOR THOSE. UNITS SEPARATE FROM THE TWELVE THOUSAND A YEAR ON. BOARDING SO THAT AND I'M NOT. I DON'T STILL THE PRICE OF BURKE AT THE ONLINE AND- VETERANS REQUIREMENT HOPE YOU THAT ALL PROPERTIES AFTER WORD OF OCCUPIED AFTER NINETY DAYS TO WORK FULLY OCCUPIED OF COURSE IS ALWAYS VERY ABILITY AND PROPERTIES- BEGINNING GIVEN DAY SO I WANNA MAKE THAT DISTINCTION BETWEEN ROOM CAN HELP YOU GROUP HE WAS A TEMPORARY PROGRAM WE DID NOT ADMINISTER THAT YEAH THAT WASN'T A POINT IN TIME AS A PUBLIC HEALTH RESPONSE THEY WERE NOT EVER. SO MAKING THREE MIGHT BE LEGITIMATE BUT THEY WERE NOT PERMANENT UNITS THAT WE'RE GOING TO KEEP IN THE PORTFOLIO. I IT'S SO. HAPPENS THEY JUST DID T BE CLEAR WERE PROVOKING AND IN OCT REQUIRE AFTER NINETY DAYS SO ON THAT FIRST ITERATION OF HUNKY. YOU CONSIDER US FULLY OCCUPIED RIGHT IN THE SENSE OF. IT ALWAYS COULD BE CENTER OVER HERE AND THEY'RE JUST LIKE WITHIN THE APARTMENT COMPLEX. THE ONLY DISTINCTION I WOULD ASK YOU SOME OF THE USES WITHIN HOME HE- ILLEGIBLE INTERIM. AND PERMANENT UNITS IS ACTUALLY WHAT THAT BREAKDOWN WAS IF THAT'S HELPFUL AND THERE ALSO ARE NUMBER OF UNITS THAT ARE IN A ROOM AT FIRST AND THEN WILL BE CONVERTING TO PERMIT OVER TIME DEPENDING UPON THE COMMUNITY- THE CONDITIONS IRATE SO THEY MAY HAVE. YOUR TAKE FOR EXAMPLE YOU MAY HAVE A COUPLE OF ACQUISITIONS AND THE RUNNING SOME OF THAT WAS GETTING THROWN. AND THEN AS THEY GET OTHER UNIS ONLINE WILL MOVE THOSE FOLKS IN THE CURRENT HOUSING MANY REHAB THAT AND AROUND. TRYING NOT TO PERMIT THAT SORT OF THING SO YOU SEE A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH AT A LOCAL. LEVEL AND THE ABILITY TO HAVE THAT FLEXIBILITY AT TOP RUNNING EITHER INTERIM. INTERIM TO PERMANENT OR PERMANENT HOUSING SO YOU STOP PRETTY- A LOT OF A LOT OF VARIETY IN TERMS OF LOOKING HE'S PURSUED. AND PRESERVATION AND CONTINUE TO PURSUE. OTHER INTERESTS ACCORDING HOUSING GOT. AN IDEA AND I THINK THAT THAT'S GREAT TO HEAR THEIR FULLY OCCUPIED AND NOT LOOK AT FULL OCCUPANCY LIKE BETWEEN. LIKE. 9295% THERE'S ALWAYS SOME. ON ANY GIVEN DAY. MOVE BY PER. THAT THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR- THANK YOU FOR YOUR- PERCENT. THANK YOU MUCH HAD PANEL NUMBER THREE WE'RE GOING TO MOVE FORWARD WITH PANEL NUMBER FOUR. I KNOW THE SOME FOLKS MAY HAVE HAD TO DROP OFF AND- JUST FOR- TIME LIKE TIME WISE WE ARE ALSO A STILL EXPECTING PUBLIC COMMENT. SO WE'RE GONNA IT LET'S MOVE FORWARD WITH THE PENDULUM BEFORE IT WILL START WITH THAT MINUTES HEIDI MARSTON. WITH THEM B. LOS ANGELES HOMELESSNESS- SERVICES AUTHORITY LHASA. THIS MARCIN YOU THERE. YES I'M HERE CAN YOU HEAR ME YES PLEASE BEGIN. WONDERFUL THANK YOU THANK YOU COMMITTEE MEMBERS CHECK CREATE YOUR WAX- IN THE COMMITTEE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY AS WAS MENTIONED I'M HEIDI MAHER SAID I AM THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE LOS ANGELES HOMELESS SERVICES AUTHORITY OR LHASA. WE ARE THE LEADING ENTITY FOR HOMELESSNESS AND ACROSS L. A. COUNTY ANALLY CITY AS WELL AS THE CONTINUUM OF CARE. I KNOW WE'RE HOLDING THIS HEARING TODAY TWO YEARS INTO A GLOBAL PANDEMIC THAT HAS REALLY TESTED ARE HOMELESS RESPONSE SYSTEM. AND LEFT MANY HOUSEHOLDS MORE VULNERABLE THAN WE'VE EVER SEEN INTERRUPTING THE ECONOMY LEAVING PEOPLE SICK- THE CARE FOR THEIR LOVED ONES WITH A LOT OF INTERVENTIONS BEING NEEDED BUT- THANKFULLY WITH THE SUPPORT AND RESPONSIVENESS FROM THE STATE OUR WHOLE SERVICES SYSTEMS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO RESPOND AND- INNOVATE. AND REALLY TO FIND NEW WAYS TO SERVE OUR MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS WHICH I KNOW HAS BEEN A TOPIC OF CONVERSATION HERE TODAY- BUT BEFORE I TALK ABOUT THAT I DO WANT TO TAKE A QUICK STEP BACK AND SHARE SOME OF THE FACTORS THAT. THREATEN OUR HOMELESSNESS CRISIS FOR YEARS NAMELY THE LACK OF HOUSING AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR VULNERABLE NEIGHBORS. I BE AN ADEQUATE PROTECTIONS FOR VULNERABLE TENANTS. COURSE INSUFFICIENT INCOMES AND THE STRUCTURAL RACISM THAT CONTINUES TO PERMEATE ALL OF OUR SYSTEMS. THOSE FACTORS CERTAINLY PROCESS AND WE REALLY CAN'T TALK ABOUT HOMELESSNESS- WITHOUT TALKING ABOUT THOSE ELEMENTS. I JUST SUPPORT SOME NUMBERS TO IT FOR EVERY. ONE HUNDRED. LOW INCOME RENTER HOUSEHOLDS IN JUST IN CALIFORNIA. THERE ARE ONLY TWENTY FOUR AVAILABLE APARTMENTS OUT FOR THOSE HOUSEHOLDS THAT THEY CAN AFFORD SO THIS IS AGAIN LIKE A REALLY BAD GAME OF MUSICAL CHAIRS- THAT NOBODY SHOULD HAVE TO PLAY IT LEAVES OUR MOST VULNERABLE WITHOUT MANY OPTIONS. AS WELL AS LONG AS THAT IMBALANCE PROCESS WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO CONTINUE TO SEE WHAT WE SEE IN PLACES LIKE LA WHERE PEOPLE BECOME HOMELESS AND FALL INTO HOMELESSNESS FASTER THAN WE CAN HOUSE THEM. IN LOS ANGELES- BASED ON OUR TWENTY TWENTY INFORMATION TWO HUNDRED AND FIVE PEOPLE EXITING HOMELESSNESS EVERY SINGLE DAY. AND TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE PEOPLE FELL INTO HOMELESSNESS EVERY SINGLE DAY SO WE HAVE TO FIX THAT IMBALANCE AND TURN OFF THE. FAUCET OF PEOPLE WHO ARE FALLING AND- BUT DESPITE ALL THE REALITY ARE HOMELESS SERVICES IS DOWN OUR OUTREACH TEAMS OUR COMMUNITY PROVIDERS. HAVE BEEN ENORMOUSLY RESILIENT DURING THE CAN'T THAT MAC. AND WITH SUPPORT FROM THE STATE LOSS SAID THE CITY OF L. A. COUNTY FLA AND OUR COMMUNITY REALLY CAME TOGETHER TO SET A COLLECTIVE TARGET ON HOW DO WE GET AS MANY PEOPLE INSIDE IF POSSIBLE WHEN THE COVERED NINETEEN PANDEMIC CAT. AND IN A MATTER OF WEEKS OUR COLLECTIVE EFFORTS ALL COMING TOGETHER BROUGHT OVER THIRTY HOTELS AND MOTELS ONLINE YOUR PROJECT BRING KEY. AT ITS PEAK THERE WERE THIRTY SEVEN PRIVATE ROOM KEY SITES ACROSS THE LEE COUNTY REPRESENTING MORE THAN THIRTY SIX HUNDRED HOTEL ROOMS. AND THAT'S MORE THAN. ANY OTHER REGION IN THE COUNTRY. OKAY LEARNED A LOT FROM THE ROOM HE M√Ä- MOST IMPORTANTLY IT'S THAT WHEN WE ALL COME TOGETHER FROM ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT GOVERNMENT AND PARTNERS. WE CAN MOVE FASTER THAN WE EVER THOUGHT WE COULD- WE RAN FOR IT ALSO REPORTS THAT WE NEED TO BUILD UP THE WAYS THAT WE'RE THINKING ABOUT SHELTER- VIETNAM CONGREGATE SPACES WHERE PEOPLE HAVE THEIR OWN ROOM THEY HAVE A DOOR THAT LOCKS THE BATHROOM. AT THAT DIGNITY AND PRIVACY HAS DEMONSTRATED AT LONG TERM OUTCOMES THAT ARE MUCH BETTER THAN WHAT WE SEE AND THE REST OF OUR PORTFOLIO. PEOPLE STAY LONGER AND THEY'RE MORE LIKELY TO MOVE INTO PERMANENT HOUSING- BUT ALSO NOT SURPRISINGLY PEOPLE WHO ARE MORE LIKELY TO ACCEPT THE SHELTER- BECAUSE A LOT OF TIMES FOLKS HAVE RESERVATIONS OR CONCERNS. ABOUT GOING TO CONGREGATE SETTINGS. SO DOING THAT OUT SINCE THE BEGINNING A PROJECT ROOM HE OVER TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SERVED AT IN THOSE SITES JUST IN L. A. COUNTY. AND THE REAL SUCCESS TO ME IN FACT ARE OVER THREE THOUSAND OF THOSE PEOPLE HAVE MOVED FROM THE PROJECT BRING KEYSIGHT INTO PERMANENT HOUSING. AND LESS THAN 10% OF THEM ARE RETURNING TO THE STREET THESE NUMBERS REALLY FLOW AWAY WHAT WE SEE ACROSS THE REST OF THE SYSTEM- I'M REALLY CRITICAL COMPONENTS THAT IS THE HAVE. FUNDING FROM THE STATE EXPANDED AND SPECIAL INGREDIENT MAKING THIS WORK- WE HAVE YOU'D HAVE TO SUPPORT OUR HOMELESS PREVENTION PROGRAMS INCLUDING OUR PROBLEM SOLVING PROGRAM WHICH PROVIDES COUNSELING AND FLEXIBLE ASSISTANCE TO PEOPLE IN CRISIS. WHO ARE NOT YET HOMELESS- ARE NOT YET FALL INTO HOMELESSNESS. BUT WE DO RECOGNIZE THAT FOR MANY PEOPLE WE COULD HAVE PREVENTED THEIR HOMELESSNESS WITH SOME SORT OF WELL TIME FLEXIBLE INTERVENTION UP FRONT AND THAT'S WHAT OUR PROBLEM SOLVING IS REALLY DEMONSTRATING FALL INTO HOMELESSNESS WE ALSO USE HAVE TO FUND INTERIM HOUSING INTERVENTIONS THAT BRING PEOPLE INSIDE FROM THE ELEMENTS. I'M CREATING A SAFE SPACE WHERE THEY CAN WORK WITH THE CASE MANAGER TO START PLANNING FOR TRANSITIONING INTO HOUSING. WE ALSO USE HALF FOR A RENTAL SUBSIDIES- AND AGAIN WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO ALL THIS BECAUSE OF THE FLEXIBILITY THAT HAPPENS AFFORDED TO US- AND GIVING US A RANGE OF INTERVENTIONS TO ADDRESS HOMELESS THAT'S BECAUSE YOU ALL HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING TODAY IT'S REALLY NOT ONE SIZE FITS ALL. LOOKING FORWARD WE DO NEED TO DO MORE AND AS THESE COMMITTEES WORK TOWARDS CRAFTING A BUDGET FOR TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE AND BUILDING ON A STARK INVESTMENT IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET THERE ARE COUPLE OF CORE PRINCIPLES THE BEATING COURAGE YOU ALSO KEEP AT THE FRONT OF THE CONVERSATIONS. THE FIRST IS THE NEED FOR ONGOING FUNDING. FOR THE BILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT IN THAT THE STUDY CAP BOTH IN THE CURRENT BUDGET YEAR AND NEXT YEAR IS SO VITAL IN ENSURING WE HAVE THE RESOURCES WE NEED TO MOVE PEOPLE OFF THE STREET- AND HELP. CREATE THAT LONG TERM PLANNING THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN AROUND STOPPING UP CASE MANAGEMENT SHELTER BEDS. THE CONSISTENCY IS REALLY KEY AND WE NEED THE LEGISLATURE TO PROVIDE AT TO PRIORITIZE MAKING THE FUNDING PERMANENT SO WE CAN ENSURE OUR SERVICE PROVIDERS ARE NOT PROFIT. I HAVE THAT ABILITY AND STABILITY SO THEY CAN SCALE UP THEIR ORGANIZATIONS. AT THE STATE ALSO BEGAN EXACTING FLEXIBLE DOLLARS FOR LOCAL PROVIDERS IN THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET YEAR- BUT HAS CHANGED THE PROGRAM SINCE THEN- BUT THAT WAS A PROMISING PROGRAM SO JUST PUTTING IT IN ANOTHER CONTACT. WE WOULD NEVER EXPECT THE FACT IT PICKS ASK FOR MARK EIGHT THROUGH TWELVE SCHOOLS IF THEY HAD TO GO TO SACRAMENTO EACH YEAR TO MAKE SURE THEY HAVE THE NEEDED FUNDING TO CONTINUE THEIR SCHOOLING PROGRAMS. AND EXPECTING IT OF THE HOMELESSNESS RESPONSE SYSTEM DOESN'T MAKE SENSE- IN THE SAME CONTACTS. ANOTHER PIECE THAT I WANT TO EMPHASIZE INCENTIVES POLICIES AND PROGRAMS DESIGNED THAT REALLY ENCOURAGED LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO INVEST IN BALANCE HOMELESS SYSTEMS. HERE AT LOS THE EVERY YEAR WE CAN DOCTOR WE CALL A SYSTEM ANALYSIS AND IT DETERMINES WHERE ARE THE GREATEST NEEDS IN OUR SYSTEM RELATIVE TO THE POPULATION THAT WE HAVE. AND THE ONE THING WE FIND YEAR OVER YEAR IS THAT THE IDEAL RATIO FOR OUR SYSTEM IS THAT WE HAVE FIVE PERMANENT HOUSING INTERVENTIONS FOR EVERYONE IN A ROOM HOUSING BAD. WITHOUT THAT WE FIND PEOPLE MOVING INTO INTERIM OR TEMPORARY OPTIONS STAYING THERE FOR A LONG TIME WITH NO EXIT PATHWAY AND NO OPTIONS TO GO TO. SO ADDED MORE WE GET THE FLOW. AND WE CAN ACTUALLY SERVE MORE PEOPLE IN THOSE INTERNED HOUSING BAD. BACK RATIO IT LOOKS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT IN EACH COMMUNITY BUT WE SHOULD CERTAINLY CONTINUE TO MAKE SURE EVERY COMMUNITY IS USING A DATA CENTRIC APPROACH. TO DETERMINE THAT RIGHT RAISE THE L. AS. THE HOUSING RESOURCES BECOME AVAILABLE. THERE'S ALSO A IN BACK THAT WOULD YIELD RESULTS IT IF THE STATE DOES FUND THEM AXIAL STATEWIDE. INCLUDES RENTAL ASSISTANCE WE'VE SEEN THAT REALLY LARGE INFUSIONS OF RENTAL ASSISTANCE ALLOW US TO MOVE PEOPLE QUICKLY OFF THE STREET AND OUT OF SHELTERS AND INTO EXISTING HEALTH HOUSING. WITHOUT HAVING WAITING HAVING TO WAIT FOR MONTHS FOR HOUSING TO COME ONLINE. WE ALSO KNOW THERE'S FIERCE COMPETITION IN THE HOUSING MARKET FOR WHAT UNITS THERE ARE. SO WE WILL GET RECOMMENDED STATE INVESTMENT HOUSING NAVIGATION TO ENSURE THEIR SUFFICIENT CASE MANAGEMENT AND SERVICES STAFFING AND CAPACITY TO ACTUALLY SUPPORT THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE THOSE RENTAL SUBSIDIES ENHANCE BUT NEED HELP FINDING AN APARTMENT AND GOING THROUGH THAT PROCESS. WE ALSO RECOMMEND THE STATE TO CONTINUE INVESTMENT IN HOUSING UNIT ACQUISITION STRATEGIES SO THIS LOOKS LIKE CONTINUING TO DOUBLE DOWN ON STRATEGIES LIKE PROJECT FROM KEY. BUT ALSO MASTER LEASING THAT ALLOWS LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO USE MULTIPLE HOUSING UNITS IN THE BUILDING WHERE WE CAN RENT OUT ENTIRE BUILDING- OR YOU KNOW TEN FIFTEEN TWENTY UNITS IN THE BUILDING THAT IS LINKED TO A SUBSIDY SO IT'S GUARANTEED STOCK. FOR US TWO YEARS- FOR UNCLES NEIGHBORS. AND FINALLY AND OF CRITICAL IMPORTANCE WE REALLY NEED THE STATE'S ASSISTANCE TO HELP SOLVE THE WORK FORCE PRICES IN OUR SYSTEM. AT THE HOMELESS RESPONSE HAS SCALED UP AROUND THE STATE WE ARE ULTIMATELY CONSTRAINED BY A LACK OF CONSISTENT STAFFING PARTICULARLY IN OUR NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION. TOO MANY OF OUR COMMUNITY BASED PROVIDERS TOLD US THAT IF IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO KEEP THEIR PROGRAMS FULLY STAFFED THEY ARE ALWAYS DEALING WITH AGENCIES AND TURNOVER. BUT THERE AREN'T ENOUGH PEOPLE IN THE HOMELESS SERVICES WORK FORCE AND WHAT PEOPLE ARE IN THE SYSTEM ARE OFTEN UNDERPAID THEY'RE OVERWORKED AND THERE HAVE BEEN CHILLY ASK TO BE EXPOSED TO OTHER PEOPLE'S TRAUMA. AND YOU REALLY GET A LOT OF BACK PASSION FATIGUE AND POTENTIALLY RE TRAUMATIZING STAFF WHO HAVE LIVED EXPERTISE IT'S REALLY REALLY HARD WORK- AND WE NEED A TALENTED WORK FORCE AND THAT'S MOTIVATED TO DO BASS ADAM AND THAT COMES WITH PAYING THEM WELL AND GIVING THEM THE SUPPORT AND AFFECTING RATIOS THEY NEED- PART OF THE FUNDS THAT COULD BE SOLVED BY. IMMEDIATELY PROVIDING HIGHER ADMINISTRATOR FRANK- FOR OUR PROVIDERS THAT THEY HAVE THAT FLEXIBILITY TO PAY MORE COMPETITIVE RATES AND WE CAN KEEP THE STOCK WE HAVE- AND BILL THAT BETTER RECRUITING AND CAPACITY BUILDING- ACROSS OUR SYSTEM. SO AGAIN I DO WANT TO CHAIR RIO HERE WHERE A LOT WITH THE MAN OF THE COMMITTEE WE ARE SO. FOR THE IMPACT AND THE ATTENTION YOU'RE GIVING TO THIS ISSUE AND ARE REALLY EAGER TO WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE THE RIGHT INVESTMENTS MOVE THEY NEED ALL. AROUND HOMELESS OUT HERE IN LOS ANGELES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS MARCH THEN WE'RE GONNA MOVE FORWARD WITH THE- MISS EMMELINE HELGHAN DIRECTOR OF HOMELESS INITIATIVES FOR THE COUNTY OF SACRAMENTO. AND AGAIN I'LL JUST ADD IF WE CAN- TRY TO GET THROUGH THE PANEL- AS WE ALSO STILL HAVE A PUBLIC COMMENT AND ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS. CAN YOU HEAR ME. YES OKAY GREAT SORRY I HAVEN'T SENT THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THE TIME AND ATTENTION THE PANELISTS PROVIDED THIS REALLY IMPORTANT ISSUE AND A LOT OF WHAT HIGH HE SAID WAS IN THE POINTS I'M GONNA BRING UP SO WILL NOT BE DUPLICATIVE I'M AND- I SAID MY NAME IS EMILY HOW CAN I AM THE DIRECTOR OF HOMELESS INITIATIVES FOR SACRAMENTO COUNTY. AS I WANT TO SAY A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT ARE UNIQUE FROM ACCOUNTING PERSPECTIVE AND THEN LIFT UP SOME OF THE PLACES WHERE WE THINK THAT THAT STATE'S VOICE AND STATES INVESTMENT IS REALLY IMPORTANT- AS A COUNTY WE OFTEN WEAR TWO HATS IN ADDRESSING HOMELESSNESS FIRST WE ARE PROVIDING CRITICAL COUNTY WHITE SERVICES TO FOLKS IN NEED BOTH THOSE WHO ARE HOMELESS AND THOSE WHO ARE ON THE PRECIPICE OF HOMELESSNESS. IS THEIR SAFETY NET SERVICES BEHAVIORAL HEALTH HAS BEEN MENTIONED QUITE A BIT TODAY ALCOHOL AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT- SAFETY NET BENEFIT PROGRAMS AND IT'S CRITICAL THAT WE MAKE THOSE CONNECTIONS FOR FOLKS ARE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS WHERE THEY ARE ASKED TO INTEGRATE THOSE TYPES OF SERVICES INTO SHELTERS OUTREACH PROGRAMS AND HOUSING IS ONE OF OUR KEY GOALS AND THAT IN THE COMING YEARS WE'VE DONE A GOOD JOB WITH THE STATE HELP AND SUPPORT. IN A LOT OF HOUSING PROGRAMS AND I KNOW I HEARD A LOT OF CONVERSATION NO PLACE LIKE HOME IN THE HOME KEEP PROGRAMS DOESN'T REALLY GREAT EXAMPLES OFHOW WHEN YOU OVERLAY HE'S CRITICAL SERVICES- WHERE PEOPLE ARE AT AND THE HOUSING THE SUCCESS IS SO MUCH BETTER WE NEED TO THAT SAME EFFORT AT THE CRISIS MOMENT WITH OUTREACH PROGRAMS AND SHELTERS I TALK A LITTLE BIT OUT FROM THE THINGS WE'RE TRYING TO DO TO DO THAT. BUT THE SECOND HALF THE COUNTIES WHERE ESPECIALLY COUNTIES LIKE SACRAMENTO WHEN I KNOW THERE'S OTHERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE- WE'RE WE ALSO PLAY JURISDICTIONAL ROLE IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY THE SECOND LARGEST POPULATION OF UNSHELTERED HOMELESSNESS OUTSIDE OF THE CITY OF SACRAMENTO OUR RESIDENTS OF THE UNINCORPORATED COUNTY OR RESIDENTS OF OUR PARKWAY SYSTEM SO THESE ARE ARE ARE CONSTITUENTS WHOSE JURISDICTIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES LIE ON THE COUNTY SO THIS INCLUDES STREET MANAGEMENT. LAW ENFORCEMENT CRISIS RESPONSE AND OFTENTIMES WE ARE THE. FIRST OUTREACH ENGAGEMENT- AND- AS YOU MIGHT FIND IN A CITY. I SO FOR US ABOUT. THOSE ROLES REALLY AND OUR COUNTY WHETHER THEY'RE IN WITH WITHIN ONE OF OUR CITIES ARE WITHIN THE COUNTY AT LARGE. HAS ACCESS THESE SERVICES IMPORTANT- AS WITH EVERYBODY IN THE STATE WE ARE SEEING A RISE IN UNSHELTERED HOMELESSNESS IN THE VISIBILITY. EXACERBATED BY CALLED IT AND I THINK SOME OF THE THINGS THAT HEIDI LIFT UP ABOUT- THE EXPERIENCE OF PROJECT ROOM KEY ECHO CERTAINLY WITH US- WE SERVED OVER THAT SINCE. SINCE THE START FOR ABOUT NAY JANUARY WE'VE SERVED OVER TWO THOUSAND HOUSEHOLDS THAT ARE PROJECT GREEN KEY PROGRAMME. AND EXIT FOUR HUNDRED OVER FOUR HUNDRED TO PERMANENT HOUSING IN ANOTHER THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY. TWO A TEMPORARY HOUSING- WE STILL HAVE- THREE HUNDRED OR FOUR HUNDRED PEOPLE AND TODAY. AND ARE WORKING ON RAMPING DOWN IT HAS BEEN A CHALLENGE I HEARD SOME QUESTIONS BUT OCCUPANCY. AT THE PANDEMIC HAS WAXED AND WANED AND WE'VE HAD TO HOLD ROOMS ASIDE FOR MEDICAL ISOLATION. IT HAS IT HAS RESULTED IN A FLOW THAT IS DIFFICULT TO MANAGE. BUT CERTAINLY THE LESSONS LEARNED FROM PROJECT BRING KEEP ARE SIMILAR TO WHAT HIGH THE ELEVATED. IS OUR ABILITY TO SERVE FOLKS TO BE PREVIOUSLY- THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT TO BE- I'M INTERESTED IN SERVICES WHEN WHAT WE ARE OFFERING OFFERING THEM AS A PRIVATE ROOM WITH DIGNITY WITH SERVICES. WITH SECURITY- WITH SO MUCH GREATER AND WE ARE. WORKING NOW TO TRANSLATE THOSE LESSONS INTO OUR INTO OUR WORK OVERALL. SO SOME pDOING- WE DO RUN AND ADMINISTER SHELTERS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTY WE HAVE. A HOST OF ABOUT SIX HUNDRED SHELTER BEDS THAT ARE WHAT I WOULD CALL YOUR TRADITIONAL SHELTERS. THAT WE ARE RUNNING ANNUALLY THEY SERVE ALL. SORTS OF POPULATIONS I'M- AND WE ALSO ARE AT THE DRY OF THE OF THESE HOME PRO. THAT HAS THAT EACH UNIQUE. TO ABOUT WE WITH THIS ON A ON A VARIETY OF THOSE BUT SOME OF THE NEW THINGS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO LIFT UP. AND IS HOW WE- HOW WE ENGAGE IN OUTREACH ON THE STREET- AS I THINK MANY OF YOU HAVE SAID BEFORE- FOR A LOT OF FOLKS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS THE NEED FOR DEEP SERVICES IS CRITICAL. AND SO HOW CAN WE CONNECT THOSE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT SERVICES. ON THE GROUND FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE LIVING UNSHELTERED RIGHT NOW. EARLY IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE WE GET A VERY SMALL PILOT OF A MULTI DISCIPLINARY TEAM- THAT CONSISTED OF COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WORKERS. AND COUNTY SOCIAL WORKERS AND CONTRACTED HOUSING NAVIGATORS TARGETING CANCER WE KNEW THAT EITHER THE CAMP HAD BEEN THERE FOR A LONG TIME. HAD GROWN LARGE OR THE POPULATION WAS EXTREMELY VULNERABLE EVERYTHING FROM LANGUAGE BARRIERS TO THE EXTREME MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS. AND WE SAW A SUCCESS WITH THAT APPROACH- BREAK LEADING WITH SERVICES THAT WERE VERY THAT WE HADN'T SEEN AND INSERT THE- USUAL PRACTICE. SO WE ARE ELEVATING THAT SCALING THAT UP AND SOON WILL HAVE THREE OF THESE TEAMS MULTI DISCIPLINARY TEAMS WORKING THROUGHOUT THE COUNTY RESPONDED TO THE CABINETS. ONE OF THE THINGS I WANTED TO LIFT UP THAT WE'RE EXCITED ABOUT IS SUSTAINING THAT TYPE OF TOUCH AND INTEGRATING THAT WITH SOME OF THE WORK AT CALTRAIN WE ARE REALLY EXCITED AND HELP. THE OPPORTUNITIES WITH CAROLINE AND HOW TO LAKE MEDI CAL REIMBURSEMENT AND FRANKLY HEALTH PROVIDERS IN GENERAL INTO THESE OUTREACH EFFORTS SO. LOOKING FORWARD TO THOSE CONTINUE CONVERSATIONS WITH DH CS AS WELL AS OUR PARTNERS IN THE TRADITIONAL HOUSING SIDE OF THE STATE. I'M THE SECOND THING WE AS OTHER COMMUNITIES ARE DOING IS TRYING TO FIND NEW YOU WITH NEW AND UNIQUE WAYS TO SHELTER PEOPLE. AS I SAID HERE KAY WAS A GREAT- A LESSON LARNED FOR US ABOUT HOW TO- APPROACH CHILDREN DIFFERENTLY BUT IT WAS. EXPENSIVE AND PROBABLY NOT SUSTAINABLE AT THAT LEVEL AND SO THEN THE THINGS THAT WE'RE. LOOKING AT IS STANDING UP WHAT WE'RE CALLING STATE STAY COMMUNITY SOME CAN. CALLED SAFE% GROUNDS ARE SO. ENCAMPMENTS USE POWER HOMES OTHER TO OF TIME HOME. TO PROVIDE THAT SENSE OF SAFETY SECURITY- AND DIGNITY TO FOLKS WHO HAVE BEEN LIVING OUTSIDE FOR A LONG TIME. I'M AS WITH EVERYTHING THOSE TYPES OF INVESTMENTS- TAKE BOTH AT ONE TIME CAPITAL BUT IN ONGOING OPERATING. SO AS WE LOOK TO STATE FUNDING MOVING FORWARD AND AS HE SAID ANYTHING- ANYTHING IS HELPFUL THAT WE KNOW IS PREDICTABLE. SO I'M GOING ON CONSISTENT MONEY IS ALWAYS UP TO PORT. AND THE FINAL THING I WANT TO SAY BECAUSE I THINK IT'S THAT IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT AND WITH AS WE KNOW THAT THE ONLY. REAL SOLUTION TO ALL OUR WORK IS HOUSING AND CERTAINLY- SUPPORTING THE HARD WORK H. TWO D. AND OTHERS TO BUILD MORE HOUSING IS CRITICAL. BUT JUST AS IMPORTANT WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO- CREATE MORE ACCESS TO OUR CLIENTS IN THE OPEN MARKET. AND ONE OF THE AT IT WE HAD WITH THE FIRST ROUND OF THE HAP- WE WERE ABLE TO LAUNCH A VERY SMALL WE HOUSING PILOT. BUT IT'S VERY HARD TO SUSTAIN WITH ONE TIME DOLLARS BECAUSE OFTEN THE RENTAL NEEDS OF THESE CLIENTS LAST FOR. FOR MANY YEARS AND CERTAINLY THE CASE MANAGEMENT NEEDS LAST FOR MANY MANY YEARS- OUR BOARD JUST APPROVED A ONE TIME INVESTMENT AGAIN ONE TIME BUT FROM OUR ARPA FUNDS WHERE WE'RE GONNA HAVE THREE YEARS. OF TEN MILLION DOLLARS. TO SCALE THIS BACK UP AND HOPEFULLY PROVE THE EFFICACY BUT AGAIN YOU KNOW ECHOING FRIDAY A LITTLE BIT THAT WOULD BE. AN AMAZING INVESTMENT FOR THE STATE TO MAKE TO HAVE. A FLEXIBLE PROPELLERS THAT COULD SUPPORT LOCAL RENTAL- PROGRAMS THIS IS NOT TRYING TO I'M NOT TRYING TO CREATE A NEW HOUSING AUTHORITY OR OR AT AND DUPLICATE SERVICES BUT WE FIND THAT A LOT OF OUR REALLY GREAT HOUSING PROGRAMS WHETHER THEY BE VOUCHER PROGRAMS. OR THROUGH THE CEO SEE. ARE PRETTY REGULATED THAT THEY CAN ONLY PAY UP TO THIS- AMOUNT OF RENT OR THEY CAN'T PAY THE DEPOSIT OR THEY CAN'T PROVIDE THE TENDENCY SUPPORTING SERVICES. SO WE SEE OUR JOB AS LOCALITY IS TO PATCH THOSE THOSE GAPS BUT WE NEED THE. ON GOING UP I'M GOING FUNDING SINCE IT PROVIDE THAT- I THINK THERE'S A MAJOR. I WANT TO UP I WANTED TO SURE THAT MY COLLEAGUE NICK FROM CITY HAS AN OPPORTUNITY I AGAIN WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND ATTENTION TO THIS EFFORT AND- THIS. IS A CRITICAL NEED. AND I APPRECIATE THE STATE ELEVATING THIS THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS HOW CAN UNFORTUNATELY- NICK HAD TO JUMP OFF. SO JUST ONE VERY BRIEF- QUESTION FOR YOU BOTH AND THEN WE CAN- CLOSE OUT AND GO TO PUBLIC COMMENT. HOW ARE YOU BOTH COORDINATING WITH YOUR LOCAL PARTNERS AND IF YOU CAN KEEP YOUR ANSWERS BRIEF AND WE CAN EXPAND AT A LATER TIME THAT BE GREAT. WELL I GUESS I'M HAPPY THAT TO GO IN FIRST- THE CERTAINLY- WE CAN'T DO THIS. ALONE WE HAVE REGULAR AND- ON GOING COMMUNICATIONS AND WITH OTHER CONTINUE MEDICARE AND OUR CITIES. I KNOW LISA AND NICK WERE SUPPOSED TO BE AT CO PRESENTING WITH ME AND YOU WOULD HAVE I THINK HER LET MORE FROM THEM. AND WE ARE WORKING TOGETHER I KNOW SOME OF YOU REFERENCE THE EDITORIAL THIS MORNING AND UNFORTUNATELY DIDN'T CAPTURE ALL THE WORK WE ARE DOING. I'M TO CREATE A CORD NAY ACCESS SYSTEM THAT REFLECTS BOTH THE NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY. AND THEIR RESOURCES AND WE HAVE A COMMITMENT BOTH A WORKING COMMITMENT ALSO FUNDING COMMITMENT TO SH TO PLAN ACROSS- ACROSS THE JURISDICTIONS. AS WE'RE APPROACHING HAP THREE AS WE'RE APPROACHING OUR ARPA FUNDS. AND WORKING TOGETHER TO IDENTIFY THE GAPS AND ALSO FRANKLY FIGURE OUT THE BEST ROLES WHAT WHAT CAN THE CITY DO BEST LOOKING TO KIND OF ASK NICOTINE WITH CARE TO THAT SO. IT'S AN ONGOING ITERATIVE CONVERSATION- AND WE OBVIOUSLY HAVE OUR JURISDICTIONAL HATS WE WEAR. BUT I THINK ALL OF US ARE COMMITTED TO TAKING THIS. OFTEN AND REALLY DIGGING OUR HEELS AND LINE. FROM LOS NO OKAY WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND APPRECIATE THAT ANSWER MISS TALKING IF THERE ARE NO ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS FROM THE MEMBERS OF THE DYESS- REALLY APPRECIATE YOU AND THANK YOU FOR STICKING AROUND FOR A LAST PANEL AND I'M SURE WE'LL HAVE A LOT OF FOLLOW UP MOVING FORWARD THANK YOU SO MUCH WE'RE GONNA GO TO PUBLIC COMMENT NOW.
