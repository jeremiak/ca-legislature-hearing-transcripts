FUTURE. AND SO WE BOTH EMBARKED

00:04:04.911 --> 00:04:05.278

SOME YEARS AGO A BILL WITH A

00:04:10.817 --> 00:04:13.853
BILL THAT'S RELATED TO THIS

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.288
MEASURE THAT WE HAVE HERE TODAY

00:04:15.355 --> 00:04:18.458
WHICH BY THE WAY I'M TAKING THE

00:04:18.524 --> 00:04:20.093

USED FOR SHAREHOLDERS IN A

00:04:25.565 --> 00:04:26.432
SMALL PART OF THE HELD

00:04:26.499 --> 00:04:28.968
CORPORATIONS WE FOUND. THAT

00:04:29.035 --> 00:04:30.903
OFTEN IN BANKING TRANSACTIONS.

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:32.338
WHEN CENTER BRADFORD IS HERE

00:04:32.405 --> 00:04:33.773
BEFORE WHEN THIS WAS PRESENTED

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.808
WHEN HE WAS SHARE. WHERE WE HAD

00:04:35.875 --> 00:04:37.577
FRAUD IN CASES WHERE SOMEONE

00:04:37.644 --> 00:04:39.579

IT'S IT BECOMES IMPOSSIBLE TO

00:04:46.819 --> 00:04:49.689
DO THAT. AND SO WE DID THAT AND

00:04:49.756 --> 00:04:51.524
THEN SUBSEQUENT TO THAT. WHICH

00:04:51.591 --> 00:04:53.292

THAT WE WERE BOTH PART OF THE

00:05:06.606 --> 00:05:08.441
IMPACT OF THAT WORKING GROUP

00:05:08.508 --> 00:05:10.543

MARKET FOR MAYBE FIVE COMPUTERS

00:05:36.135 --> 00:05:41.274
THOMAS WATSON CHAIRMAN IBM

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.028
THAT THE IPHONE IS GOING TO GET

00:06:02.095 --> 00:06:04.030

TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN. THE

00:06:08.901 --> 00:06:10.002
BOTTOM LINE IS THAT THERE ARE

00:06:10.069 --> 00:06:11.404
THINGS SOMETIMES AT WORK AND

00:06:11.471 --> 00:06:12.538

CALIFORNIA WE'VE GOT TO BE ON

00:06:14.006 --> 00:06:15.808
THE CUTTING EDGE AND SO WHAT

00:06:15.875 --> 00:06:16.843
WE'RE DOING WITH THIS MEASURE

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:18.411
VERY BRIEFLY IS ONE WITH THE

00:06:18.478 --> 00:06:19.712
COMMITTEE MOMENTS EXTENDING.

00:06:19.779 --> 00:06:22.815
THIS MEASURE THAT WE ADOPTED A

00:06:22.882 --> 00:06:25.384
FEW YEARS AGO RELATING TO

00:06:25.451 --> 00:06:25.952
SHAREHOLDING CORPORATIONS BY

00:06:26.018 --> 00:06:27.954
FIVE YEARS. FURTHER DELAY WAS

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:29.288
WE KIND OF TOOK A HIATUS IN

00:06:29.355 --> 00:06:30.623
WORKING ON THE- ON THE WORKING

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:32.425
GROUP. AND SECONDLY TO

00:06:32.492 --> 00:06:34.160
INCORPORATE THE DEFINITION OF

00:06:34.227 --> 00:06:36.129
DECENTRALIZED DATA SYSTEMS.

00:06:36.195 --> 00:06:37.463
WHICH IS THE DEFINITION THAT

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:39.165
CAME OUT OF THE HARD WORK. OF

00:06:39.232 --> 00:06:41.000
THE BLOCKCHAIN WORKING GROUP AS

00:06:41.067 --> 00:06:42.969

00:06:43.035 --> 00:06:44.837
SO I WOULD ASK YOU AYE VOTE AND

00:06:44.904 --> 00:06:46.706

THE RICH POOR DIVIDE THAT

00:06:52.945 --> 00:06:54.013
OCCUPIES MY THINKING

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:57.183
TREMENDOUSLY. IT'S IMPORTANT TO

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:58.151
LOOK AT THESE CUTTING EDGE

00:06:58.217 --> 00:06:59.519
IDEAS TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO

00:06:59.585 --> 00:07:00.720
WITH THE PRIVATE SECTOR HAS

00:07:00.787 --> 00:07:02.121
DONE EXTRAORDINARY THINGS.

00:07:02.188 --> 00:07:04.056
GROCERY PROVIDERS ARE USING

NOT THE INTENT OF THE BILL. BUT

00:38:04.148 --> 00:38:06.317
WE DO NOT SEE WHY IF THAT IS

00:38:06.384 --> 00:38:08.219
THE CASE THAT LANGUAGES NOT

DEALING WITH AND RIGHT NOW THIS

00:44:04.508 --> 00:44:05.909
PRACTICES ALLOWED WE DON'T WE

WANT TO CHANGE THAT PRACTICE

00:44:07.644 --> 00:44:10.848
DOING GOING FORWARD THAT'S ON

00:44:10.914 --> 00:44:12.583
ADVICE OF COUNSEL WE DON'T HAVE

OF WOULD YOU LIKE TO FOLLOW UP

00:44:15.853 --> 00:44:17.621
-- YES ONE OTHER QUESTION --

JUST SAY THAT I'M GONNA SUPPORT

00:44:23.193 --> 00:44:24.762
THE BILL TODAY AND I I THINK

00:44:24.828 --> 00:44:26.764
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT THE

00:44:26.830 --> 00:44:28.832
DEBTORS UNDERSTAND WHO IT IS

00:44:28.899 --> 00:44:30.868
IT'S COLLECTING ON IT'S BECOME

00:44:30.934 --> 00:44:33.670
INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT TO KNOW

00:44:34.271 --> 00:44:36.540
WHETHER IT'S A SCAM OR WHETHER

00:44:36.607 --> 00:44:38.609
IT'S SOMEBODY TRYING TO COLLECT

00:44:38.675 --> 00:44:40.644
A DEBT THAT YOU HAVE NO IDEA

00:44:40.711 --> 00:44:42.646
YOU KNOW OR THEY MAY BE IN YOUR

00:44:42.713 --> 00:44:45.883
NAME THAT'S NOT YOURS OR DAD

00:44:46.450 --> 00:44:47.718
THEY HAVE A SIMILAR NAME TWO

00:44:47.785 --> 00:44:49.019
YEARS AND THEY'RE JUST THEY'RE

00:44:49.086 --> 00:44:50.821
JUST SCOUTING TO SEE IF ANYBODY

00:44:50.888 --> 00:44:52.389
WILL PAY IT I'M AND I'VE HAD

00:44:52.456 --> 00:44:55.025
ALL OF THAT HAPPENED TO ME AND

00:44:55.092 --> 00:44:58.162
SO I I'M I I DO UNDERSTAND HOW

00:44:58.228 --> 00:44:59.830
IMPORTANT THIS IS IT THIS IS

00:44:59.897 --> 00:45:01.965
BACK -- IN REGARDS TO THAT THE

00:45:02.032 --> 00:45:04.234
FEDERAL ACTION IS BEING TAKEN

00:45:04.301 --> 00:45:06.503
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE

00:45:06.570 --> 00:45:09.840
FEDERAL IS A BOTTOM BASELINE

00:45:09.907 --> 00:45:12.943
-- KIND OF OF PROCESS AND THAT

00:45:13.010 --> 00:45:15.012
WE CAN ADD IT DOESN'T PREEMPT

00:45:15.079 --> 00:45:17.414
THE STATE FROM ADDING MORE --

00:45:17.481 --> 00:45:19.483
REGULATORY OVERSIGHT AND SO

00:45:19.550 --> 00:45:22.019
I'M WONDERING IF IF -- IF THE

00:45:22.086 --> 00:45:23.153
SENATOR COULD TALK A LITTLE

00:45:23.220 --> 00:45:24.588
BIT ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING

00:45:24.655 --> 00:45:25.823
AT THE AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL

00:45:25.889 --> 00:45:27.624
UNDERSTANDING THAT IT IS A

00:45:27.691 --> 00:45:29.326
BOTTOM AND HOW THIS WOULD WORK

00:45:29.393 --> 00:45:31.261

INDIA THE REQUESTED THAT WE

00:45:33.831 --> 00:45:34.898
NOT TAKE ANY ACTION AND I

00:45:34.965 --> 00:45:37.000
THINK WE SHOULD BUT I'D LIKE

00:45:37.067 --> 00:45:38.001

FROM SALINAS IS EXACTLY CORRECT

00:45:46.643 --> 00:45:48.679
THIS IS IT AND IT'S NOT CERTAIN

00:45:48.745 --> 00:45:49.913
THAT THE FEDERAL REGULATIONS

00:45:49.980 --> 00:45:51.615
