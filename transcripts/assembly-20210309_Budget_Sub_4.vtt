KEEP PROJECTS. DO YOU WORK- BE

00:41:15.206 --> 00:41:16.674
MADE RIGHT NOW WE ALLOW DO MORE

00:41:16.740 --> 00:41:18.042
OF THE SAME IN TERMS OF

00:41:18.108 --> 00:41:21.111
ACQUISITIONS- WE WERE ABLE TO

00:41:21.178 --> 00:41:23.714
WITH THE- US EUROPE DOLLARS AS

00:41:23.781 --> 00:41:25.583
WELL SOME GENERAL FUND. FUND

00:41:25.649 --> 00:41:27.084
OVER SIX THOUSAND UNITS WITH

00:41:27.151 --> 00:41:29.587
HOKEY. TWO THOUSAND TWENTY NINE

00:41:29.653 --> 00:41:30.287
FIRED RUBBER THE NUMBER

00:41:30.354 --> 00:41:32.256
CORRECTLY. SO WE WOULD BE ABLE

00:41:32.323 --> 00:41:33.490
TO DO MORE OF THE SAME AND THAT

00:41:33.557 --> 00:41:36.126
HAPPENED IN A VERY TIGHT TIME

00:41:36.193 --> 00:41:36.694
FRAME AS YOU GUYS AS YOU ALL

00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:38.395
KNOW. THE FUTURE OF COURSE HAD

00:41:38.462 --> 00:41:39.964
TO BE SPENT. ON A VERY SHORT

00:41:40.030 --> 00:41:42.900
TURNAROUND. AND DEMAND IS STILL

00:41:42.967 --> 00:41:44.902
ON GOING THERE ARE WE GET ASCOT

00:41:44.969 --> 00:41:46.604
QUITE REGULARLY WHEN THERE

00:41:46.670 --> 00:41:47.705
MIGHT BE MORE RESOURCES YOU

00:41:47.771 --> 00:41:49.173
MORE THE SAME THERE ARE MANY.

00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:50.307
PROJECTS AT THE STATE THAT

00:41:50.374 --> 00:41:52.009
COULD NOT MEET THE TIGHT TIME

00:41:52.076 --> 00:41:54.845
FRAMES OF HOKEY- GIVEN WHAT WE

00:41:54.912 --> 00:41:56.814
HAD TO DO WITHIN THE SIX MONTH

00:41:56.881 --> 00:41:57.848
PERIOD IN THE CALENDAR LAST

00:41:57.915 --> 00:42:00.784
YEAR. AND SO- THIS WOULD BE A

00:42:00.851 --> 00:42:03.020
NEW STANDALONE YOU KNOW NEW

00:42:03.087 --> 00:42:04.188
DEVELOPMENT NEW ACQUISITIONS

00:42:04.255 --> 00:42:05.823
THOSE SORTS OF THINGS ALONG THE

00:42:05.890 --> 00:42:06.624
SAME LINES WHAT WE GET THE

00:42:06.690 --> 00:42:09.526
FIRST TIME AROUND. SO TO SPEAK

00:42:09.593 --> 00:42:10.628
TO WHAT I THINK ARE PROBABLY

00:42:10.694 --> 00:42:12.563
SOME OF THE QUESTIONS IS WE

00:42:12.630 --> 00:42:14.999
DID. OUR DUE DILIGENCE IN

00:42:15.065 --> 00:42:17.001
ACTUALLY ASKING PROJECTS TO

00:42:17.067 --> 00:42:18.502
IDENTIFY FIVE YEARS OF

00:42:18.569 --> 00:42:19.770
OPERATION SUPPORT AND IN ALL

00:42:19.837 --> 00:42:21.572
CASES ARE ACTUALLY WILL PROVIDE

00:42:21.639 --> 00:42:23.674
TWO YEARS OF THAT. UP FRONT

00:42:23.741 --> 00:42:24.842
WITH THE RESOURCES THAT WE HAD.

00:42:24.909 --> 00:42:26.343
A WE WILL BE ABLE TO DO THE

00:42:26.410 --> 00:42:28.445
SAME THING THIS TIME. IN FACT

00:42:28.512 --> 00:42:30.347
PERHAPS MORE BECAUSE THE FUNDS

00:42:30.414 --> 00:42:32.182
WILL BE GENERAL FUND SO WON'T

00:42:32.249 --> 00:42:40.858
BE. ARMED AS INFLEXIBLE AS. THE

00:42:40.925 --> 00:42:41.625
FEAR HALF DOLLARS FOR. THIS

00:42:41.692 --> 00:42:42.626
YEAR WE COULD NOT FIND ANY SORT

00:42:42.693 --> 00:42:43.494
OF LONG TERM CAPITAL OPERATE

00:42:43.560 --> 00:42:45.462
SUPPORT. SO WE HAD ON THEM

00:42:45.529 --> 00:42:47.665
MATTER. FOR AND- SUPPORT THAT

00:42:47.731 --> 00:42:49.466
OF THE OLD. LAST TIME. AND

00:42:49.533 --> 00:42:51.435
WE'RE- THAT WE WERE ABLE TO.

00:42:51.502 --> 00:42:53.170
PROVIDE TO YOUR OFFERING

00:42:53.237 --> 00:42:55.406
SUPPORT TO ALL THE PROJECTS. WE

00:42:55.472 --> 00:42:56.173
WILL NOT BE A RESTRICTED THIS

00:42:56.240 --> 00:42:57.875
TIME AROUND AND HOW THAT WOULD

00:42:57.942 --> 00:43:00.945
WORK AS WE WOULD CAPITALIZE

00:43:01.011 --> 00:43:01.545
THAT OPERATING SUPPORT FRONT.

00:43:01.612 --> 00:43:03.113
JUST LIKE WE DID LAST TIME AND

00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:04.481
THAT IS PART TYPICAL FOR

00:43:04.548 --> 00:43:06.383
SUPPORTIVE HOUSING- FINDING

00:43:06.450 --> 00:43:09.320
LONG TERM- RESOURCES. IS A

00:43:09.386 --> 00:43:11.188
CONSTANT CHALLENGE IN FACT-

00:43:11.255 --> 00:43:12.990
IDENTIFYING UP TO FIVE YEARS.

00:43:13.057 --> 00:43:15.426
IS NOT EVEN A STANDARD MANY

00:43:15.492 --> 00:43:17.261
PROGRAMS THAT HAVE EXISTED FOR

00:43:17.328 --> 00:43:19.697
FOUR HOUSING- OVER THE PAST

00:43:19.763 --> 00:43:21.632
YEARS AND DECADES. BUT DID NOT

00:43:21.699 --> 00:43:23.233
HAVE THAT OPERATING SUPPORT SO

00:43:23.300 --> 00:43:24.668
DEVELOPMENTS WERE FORCED TO YOU

00:43:24.735 --> 00:43:26.170
KNOW BY LOCAL SPORTS THE SORT

00:43:26.236 --> 00:43:28.105
OF THINGS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

00:43:28.172 --> 00:43:30.441
AREN'T. TYPICALLY PROVIDING

00:43:30.507 --> 00:43:31.709
LONG TERM SUPPORT LONGER

00:43:31.775 --> 00:43:33.477
COMMITMENTS JUST SAY NO PLACE

00:43:33.544 --> 00:43:35.446
LIKE HOME WITH A LOT OF CITIES

00:43:35.512 --> 00:43:37.548
SOMETHING. UP PRETTY INNOVATIVE

00:43:37.614 --> 00:43:39.717
AND- REQUIRE COUNTY RIGHT UP TO

00:43:39.783 --> 00:43:41.085
TWENTY YEARS. IN THOSE CASES

00:43:41.151 --> 00:43:43.020
WHICH WAS VERY VERY HELPFUL AND

00:43:43.087 --> 00:43:48.559
IS VERY HELPFUL. HELPFUL- BUT

00:43:48.625 --> 00:43:50.060
YEAH WILL BE DEBATING MORE THIS

00:43:50.127 --> 00:43:52.830
ABOARD OF PROJECTS. LIKE WE DID

00:43:52.896 --> 00:43:55.733
THE FIRST. I SENT AN MANY OF

00:43:55.799 --> 00:43:57.067
THE PURCHASE TO PRO REQUIRE WE

00:43:57.134 --> 00:43:58.769
ADDING LIKE THIS KITCHEN OR

00:43:58.836 --> 00:44:00.504
GENERAL WELL WE HAVE BEEN. HOW

00:44:00.571 --> 00:44:02.439
MUCH WILL THAT COST AND HOLD TO

00:44:02.506 --> 00:44:06.643
BE FUNDED. SO WE REQUIRED ALL

00:44:06.710 --> 00:44:07.778
THE PRODUCT AGAIN TO FILE THE

00:44:07.845 --> 00:44:10.047
FUNDING UP FRONT RIGHT SO- WE

00:44:10.114 --> 00:44:11.615
WILL HAVE A REPORT OUT AS

00:44:11.682 --> 00:44:13.150
REQUIRED BY THE STATUTE IN

00:44:13.217 --> 00:44:14.685
APRIL ONE WHICH WILL OUTLINE

00:44:14.752 --> 00:44:17.121
ALL ALL OF THAT IT WAS A MIX-

00:44:17.187 --> 00:44:18.856
OF. THE PROJECT REQUIRE WE HAVE

00:44:18.922 --> 00:44:20.758
MANY PROJECTS ARE OPERATING AS

00:44:20.824 --> 00:44:22.659
INTERIM HOUSING SOME INTERIM

00:44:22.726 --> 00:44:24.261
TURNING INTO PERMANENT HOUSING

00:44:24.328 --> 00:44:25.996
SO IMMEDIATELY IT'S PERMANENT

00:44:26.063 --> 00:44:28.565
HOUSE. THE PROJECTS THAT HAD.

00:44:28.632 --> 00:44:31.168
LOWER REHAB COSTS COSTS MORE

00:44:31.235 --> 00:44:33.337
PER UNIT UP FRONT. THEY'RE

00:44:33.404 --> 00:44:34.805
PRETTY MUCH MORE MOVE IN READY

00:44:34.872 --> 00:44:37.141
RIGHT IF YOU THINK OF A TYPE OF

00:44:37.207 --> 00:44:38.409
HOTEL OR MOTEL THAT MAYBE

00:44:38.475 --> 00:44:40.310
ALREADY HAD. SOMETHING LIKE A

00:44:40.377 --> 00:44:43.380
KITCHENETTE- SO THE AVERAGE

00:44:43.447 --> 00:44:46.016
KIND OF COST OF OUR ACQUISITION

00:44:46.083 --> 00:44:49.319
WAS VERY DEPENDING UPON UPON

00:44:49.386 --> 00:44:53.924
THAT LEVEL. SO- IT HARD TO

00:44:53.991 --> 00:44:55.192
ANSWER THAT QUESTION ACROSS THE

00:44:55.259 --> 00:44:56.393
BOARD BECAUSE ALL THIS PROJECT

00:44:56.460 --> 00:44:59.430
VERY- I WILL SAY THE PER UNIT

00:44:59.496 --> 00:45:01.799
COST WAS WAS VERY VERY LOW AND

00:45:01.865 --> 00:45:03.967
IN SOME CASES THEY WERE

00:45:04.034 --> 00:45:05.836
DEFINITIONAL SMALL REHAB DONE

00:45:05.903 --> 00:45:07.805
IN SOME CASES IT WILL BE RE

00:45:07.871 --> 00:45:09.640
HAVE COMING IN THE COMING YEARS

00:45:09.706 --> 00:45:10.808
AND THEY MAY THEY MAY USE LOCAL

00:45:10.874 --> 00:45:12.943
FORCES THEY MAY SEEK OUT TAX

00:45:13.010 --> 00:45:14.945
CREDITS AND- A REHABILITATION

00:45:15.012 --> 00:45:16.647
SOURCES THAT WAY IT VARIES FROM

00:45:16.713 --> 00:45:17.981
PROJECT TO PROJECT BUT WE WILL

00:45:18.048 --> 00:45:19.383
BE ABLE TO ARTICULATE KIND OF A

00:45:19.450 --> 00:45:21.919
MORE. ROBUST KIND OF BREAKDOWN

00:45:21.985 --> 00:45:23.720
OF HOW MANY PROJECTS CAN FIT

00:45:23.787 --> 00:45:26.156
EACH OF THOSE BUCKETS- IN THE

00:45:26.223 --> 00:45:27.057
REPORT KAMALA JUST LITERATURE

00:45:27.124 --> 00:45:28.892

INFORMATION ON AS TO HOW MANY

00:45:37.534 --> 00:45:40.037
ASSEMBLY SEATS HOW WHAT THE

00:45:40.104 --> 00:45:43.874
DATA WITHIN. THE ASSEMBLY FIFTH

00:45:43.941 --> 00:45:44.908
IT LOOKS LIKE. LIKE LIKE ABLE

YEAH WE CAN PROVIDE THAT DATA

00:45:56.120 --> 00:45:57.955
THE PROJECT REPORTS WERE DUE TO

00:45:58.021 --> 00:45:59.256
US ON A PROJECT LEVEL ON

00:45:59.323 --> 00:46:00.924
FEBRUARY FIRST WE'RE THRILLED

00:46:00.991 --> 00:46:02.893
WITH STILL FINALIZING PULLING

00:46:02.960 --> 00:46:05.395

CAN SHOW A MAP. AS WELL AS A

00:46:09.066 --> 00:46:09.500
BREAKDOWN OF WHERE THOSE

00:46:09.566 --> 00:46:11.335
PROJECTS ARE. THAT WOULD THAT

00:46:11.401 --> 00:46:12.836
WOULD BE- THAT WOULD BE REALLY

00:46:12.903 --> 00:46:14.671

WITHIN THOSE PROJECTS. SO HOW.

00:47:23.106 --> 00:47:24.875

A CRITICAL OF THIS IS A CRISIS

00:47:50.167 --> 00:47:52.202
AND WE NEED TO BE MOVING AS

00:47:52.269 --> 00:47:53.637
FAST AS POSSIBLE TO DO WHAT WE

00:47:53.704 --> 00:47:54.738
CAN TO CREATE MORE HOUSING

00:47:54.805 --> 00:47:57.507
OPTIONS. WE HAVE A LOT OF

00:47:57.574 --> 00:47:59.076
DEMAND COMING THERE WERE MANY

00:47:59.142 --> 00:47:59.943
WHILE WE'RE REALLY PLEASED TO

00:48:00.010 --> 00:48:01.111
BE ABLE TO FIND WITH THE

00:48:01.178 --> 00:48:03.347
ADDITIONAL FUSION. LATER LAST

00:48:03.413 --> 00:48:05.582
YEAR- WELL OKAY OF DOLLARS TO

00:48:05.649 --> 00:48:06.516
DEAL FUNDS ON THE WAITING LIST

00:48:06.583 --> 00:48:08.151
WE HAVE THE FIRST ROUND. THERE

00:48:08.218 --> 00:48:09.586
ARE STILL A NUMBER OF

00:48:09.653 --> 00:48:11.855
INTERESTED PARTIES. INTERESTED

00:48:11.922 --> 00:48:13.490
COMMUNITIES TO DO HIS TYPE OF

00:48:13.557 --> 00:48:15.993
WORK AND WE THINK IF WE CAN'T

00:48:16.059 --> 00:48:18.829
DO IT FASTER WE SHOULD- IT HAS

00:48:18.895 --> 00:48:20.764
BEEN. VERY VERY HELPFUL TO GET

00:48:20.831 --> 00:48:23.867
MORE OF LARA HOMES CALIFORNIANS

00:48:23.934 --> 00:48:28.438
OFF THE STREETS. AND INTO THESE

00:48:28.505 --> 00:48:29.106
THESE HELICOPTERS. SO THERE

00:48:29.172 --> 00:48:31.208
PROP READY FOR PURCHASE AND

00:48:31.275 --> 00:48:32.776
RENOVATION TODAY. JUSTIFY THAT

00:48:32.843 --> 00:48:37.080
AMOUNT. WE BELIEVE THERE WILL

00:48:37.147 --> 00:48:38.482
BE SUFFICIENT DEMAND YES SO

00:48:38.548 --> 00:48:39.850
WHEN WE PUT OUT THE MONEY LAST

00:48:39.916 --> 00:48:41.318
YEAR FOR EXAMPLE WE WERE

00:48:41.385 --> 00:48:42.986
OVERSUBSCRIBED EVEN EACH REGION

00:48:43.053 --> 00:48:44.021
SO NOT JUST STATEWIDE BUT WE

00:48:44.087 --> 00:48:45.455
BROKE THE FUNDING DOWN BY

00:48:45.522 --> 00:48:46.823
REGION AT LEAST TWO OR THREE TO

00:48:46.890 --> 00:48:48.992
ONE. SO THAT WAS WHEN WE HAD

00:48:49.059 --> 00:48:50.360
THE RESOURCE FOR THE LAST YEAR

00:48:50.427 --> 00:48:52.529
WE DON'T OBVIOUSLY ARE TAKING A

00:48:52.596 --> 00:48:53.430
WAITING LIST RIGHT NOW BECAUSE

00:48:53.497 --> 00:48:54.731
THERE ARE NO FUNDS AVAILABLE

00:48:54.798 --> 00:48:56.700
BUT WE GET A LOT OF ENQUIRIES

00:48:56.767 --> 00:48:58.101
ABOUT WHEN WILL FUNDS BECOME

00:48:58.168 --> 00:49:00.070
AVAILABLE SO WHEN WE ARE ABLE

00:49:00.137 --> 00:49:00.904
TO DEPLOY THOSE FUNDS WERE

00:49:00.971 --> 00:49:02.472
PRETTY CONFIDENT GIVEN THE OVER

00:49:02.539 --> 00:49:03.807
SUBSCRIPTION THAT HAPPENS NOT

00:49:03.874 --> 00:49:05.175
ONLY FOR HOME KEEP UP FOR ALL

00:49:05.242 --> 00:49:06.543
OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROGRAMS

00:49:06.610 --> 00:49:09.846
WHICH TYPICALLY AT LEAST TWO OR

00:49:09.913 --> 00:49:10.380
THREE TO ONE. WHAT WE HAVE

00:49:10.447 --> 00:49:11.214
AVAILABLE THAT THE- AND WHAT

00:49:11.281 --> 00:49:13.383
CRITERIA. TO AWARD HUNKY

00:49:13.450 --> 00:49:18.889
FUNDING. THE FIRST TIME AROUND-

00:49:18.955 --> 00:49:22.125
THERE'S SEVERAL CRITERIA WORKS-

00:49:22.192 --> 00:49:23.393
ONE OF THE GREAT YOUR WE HAD HE

00:49:23.460 --> 00:49:24.728
IS THE FIRST TIME AROUND WAS

00:49:24.795 --> 00:49:25.996
ABILITY AND SPEED ON WHICH OU

00:49:26.063 --> 00:49:27.898
COULD ACQUIRE THE PROPERTY AND

00:49:27.964 --> 00:49:29.566
THEN LEASE IT UP WE WOULD NOT

00:49:29.633 --> 00:49:30.901
BE SUBJECT TO THAT RESTRICTION

00:49:30.967 --> 00:49:32.936
OF COURSE BUT THERE ARE SEVERAL

00:49:33.003 --> 00:49:34.404
DIFFERENT CRITERIA WE

00:49:34.471 --> 00:49:38.208
TYPICALLY- EVALUATE WHEN WE ARE

00:49:38.275 --> 00:49:39.776
AWARDING PROGRAMS OF THIS TYPE

00:49:39.843 --> 00:49:41.178
END OF OUR OTHER PROGRAMS RIGHT

00:49:41.244 --> 00:49:42.813
SO. IT IS LEVERAGE OF OTHER

00:49:42.879 --> 00:49:44.214
FUNDING AND COMMITMENT TO OTHER

00:49:44.281 --> 00:49:45.382
FUNDING CERTAINLY THE ABILITY

00:49:45.449 --> 00:49:46.550
PROVIDE SERVICES IN THE

00:49:46.616 --> 00:49:48.285
SERVICES PLANTS ARE CRITICAL

00:49:48.352 --> 00:49:51.855
IT'S- BEING ABLE TO GET TO THE

00:49:51.922 --> 00:49:52.723
LOCAL PER UPPER HOLDEN AND

00:49:52.789 --> 00:49:54.524
READINESS AND OF COURSE THE

00:49:54.591 --> 00:49:56.093
THINGS ARE HAPPY TO ELABORATE

00:49:56.159 --> 00:49:58.261
AND IF I COULD TURN TO MY

00:49:58.328 --> 00:49:59.930
COLLEAGUES IF YOU LIKE- WHO ARE

00:49:59.996 --> 00:50:04.668
THE KEY VENDORS THAT PROGRAM.

00:50:04.735 --> 00:50:05.302
TO REALLY GO THROUGH THE ENTIRE

00:50:05.369 --> 00:50:06.436
LIST IF YOU'D LIKE- WE- HAVE

00:50:06.503 --> 00:50:07.337
BASICALLY THINK THAT OUR

00:50:07.404 --> 00:50:09.840
THRESHOLD AS WELL AS- THE

00:50:09.906 --> 00:50:12.142
SCORING TYPICALLY OUR PROGRAMS

00:50:12.209 --> 00:50:13.543
AND- WE CAN GO THROUGH THAT

00:50:13.610 --> 00:50:15.379
LIST OF THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL

00:50:15.445 --> 00:50:16.313
NO THAT'S OKAY YOU CAN SEND ME

00:50:16.380 --> 00:50:18.048
LIST THOUGH BUT IT ALSO DOES

00:50:18.115 --> 00:50:19.216
THE HUNKY PROGRAM INCLUDE A

00:50:19.282 --> 00:50:20.784
PLAN. TO FOCUS ON THE

00:50:20.851 --> 00:50:22.552
HOMELESSNESS HOMELESS

00:50:22.619 --> 00:50:23.754
INDIVIDUALS WITH MENTAL. HEALTH

00:50:23.820 --> 00:50:28.725
ISSUES. SO THOSE INDIVIDUALS

00:50:28.792 --> 00:50:31.428
ARE CERTAINLY ELIGIBLE- AND THE

00:50:31.495 --> 00:50:32.629
FIRST AROUND OF COURSE YOU CAN

00:50:32.696 --> 00:50:34.030
HEAR DOLLARS THERE HAD TO BE A

00:50:34.097 --> 00:50:36.733
VERY CLOSE NEXUS TO COVER

00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:38.301
NINETEEN THAT WAS THE MOST

00:50:38.368 --> 00:50:41.004
IMPORTANT NEXUS AS WELL AS

00:50:41.071 --> 00:50:42.139
BEING HOMELESS OR AT RISK OF

00:50:42.205 --> 00:50:43.240
HOMELESSNESS AND OF COURSE WE

00:50:43.306 --> 00:50:45.275
KNOW WITHIN THE POPULATION ARE

00:50:45.342 --> 00:50:46.343
SIGNIFICANT TO PERSONS

00:50:46.410 --> 00:50:48.812
EXPERIENCING MENTAL ILLNESS SO-

00:50:48.879 --> 00:50:50.046
TYPICALLY HOW OUR COMMUNITY

00:50:50.113 --> 00:50:52.516
WILL PROCEED CERTAINLY AT ONCE

00:50:52.582 --> 00:50:53.517
THEY ACQUIRE THESE PROPERTIES

00:50:53.583 --> 00:50:54.818
IS WORK THROUGH THE RECORDED

00:50:54.885 --> 00:50:57.287
ENTRY SYSTEM- AT THE LOCAL

00:50:57.354 --> 00:50:59.156
CONTAINS OF CARE TO

00:50:59.222 --> 00:51:01.892
ESSENTIALLY- MOVE FOLKS FROM

00:51:01.958 --> 00:51:07.631
THAT LIST AND I SYSTEM INTO.

00:51:07.697 --> 00:51:08.565
AVAILABLE HOUSING AND WE

00:51:08.632 --> 00:51:09.933
REQUIRE THAT PARTICIPATION THE

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:11.301
PROPOSAL IN WE ARE ALWAYS HERE

00:51:11.368 --> 00:51:12.669
THE SEALS EVERYBODY ELSE THERE

00:51:12.736 --> 00:51:13.937
SUPPOSED DEALING WITH HEALTH.

00:51:14.004 --> 00:51:15.305
BUT DOES THIS ADDRESS HOW THE

00:51:15.372 --> 00:51:17.174
HELL ALMOST WERE MENTALLY WHO

00:51:17.240 --> 00:51:21.111
DO NOT WANT TO BE HEALTH. WELL

00:51:21.178 --> 00:51:22.779
THIS PER PROGRAM IN PARTICULAR

00:51:22.846 --> 00:51:25.515
IS NOT SEEKING TO. FALL FOR

00:51:25.582 --> 00:51:26.616
THAT POLICY PROBLEM WE'RE

00:51:26.683 --> 00:51:27.851
SOLVING FOR THE PULSE FROM OF

00:51:27.918 --> 00:51:29.419
ALL THE MANY MANY PEOPLE THAT

00:51:29.486 --> 00:51:30.554
ARE ON THE STREETS OF PROVIDING

00:51:30.620 --> 00:51:31.788
MORE HOUSING BECAUSE NO WE

00:51:31.855 --> 00:51:34.157
DON'T HAVE ENOUGH OF IT- AT THE

00:51:34.224 --> 00:51:35.992
LOCAL OUTREACH LEVEL. OF COURSE

00:51:36.059 --> 00:51:37.627
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT THAT

00:51:37.694 --> 00:51:38.795
TAKES PLACE BUT THE HOME KEY

00:51:38.862 --> 00:51:40.197
PROGRAM IS ABOUT ASSISTING

00:51:40.263 --> 00:51:41.665
COMMITTEES ACQUIRE. THESE

00:51:41.731 --> 00:51:42.933
PROPERTIES AND HELPING GIVE

00:51:42.999 --> 00:51:44.568
THEM SOME RESOURCES TO OPERATE

00:51:44.634 --> 00:51:46.303
THEM LONG TERM- AND THE

00:51:46.369 --> 00:51:47.237
COMMUNITIES THEMSELVES OF

00:51:47.304 --> 00:51:48.004
COURSE ARE THE ULTIMATE

00:51:48.071 --> 00:51:50.273
PROVIDERS OF THESE OF THESE.

00:51:50.340 --> 00:51:53.009
BANKS AND- RUNNERS OF THESE-

00:51:53.076 --> 00:51:54.377
BUT STILL RIGHT SO ANY

00:51:54.444 --> 00:51:57.547
PROPERTIES. SO CERTAINLY WE ARE

00:51:57.614 --> 00:51:58.615
IDENTIFYING IS AN IMPORTANT

00:51:58.682 --> 00:52:01.218
ASPECT. OF HOW WE ADDRESS

00:52:01.284 --> 00:52:03.487
HOMELESSNESS. I WILL SAY THERE

00:52:03.553 --> 00:52:04.988
ARE YOU KNOW UNFORTUNATELY IT'S

00:52:05.055 --> 00:52:06.690
FAR FAR TOO MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE

00:52:06.756 --> 00:52:09.025
IN NEED OF HOMES- AND WE'RE NOT

00:52:09.092 --> 00:52:11.094
GONNA. WE'RE LIKELY TO SEE

00:52:11.161 --> 00:52:12.562
THEY'RE NOT TO BE TAKE UP OF

00:52:12.629 --> 00:52:13.630
THESE OPPORTUNITIES AND HUNKY

00:52:13.697 --> 00:52:14.564
OR RATHER FORMAL HOUSING

00:52:14.631 --> 00:52:16.099
OPPORTUNITY SIMPLY BECAUSE OF

00:52:16.166 --> 00:52:18.201
THE DESIRE NOT TO THE WANT TO

00:52:18.268 --> 00:52:19.469
GO INTO THIS. WE HAVE A STATE

00:52:19.536 --> 00:52:20.504
PROVIDES THE MONEY IN THE

00:52:20.570 --> 00:52:22.239
PEOPLE SEE ALL TOO WELL YOU IN

00:52:22.305 --> 00:52:24.174
DOWNTOWN SACRAMENTO. A GOOD

00:52:24.241 --> 00:52:25.909
POPULATION THAT IS MENTALLY ILL

00:52:25.976 --> 00:52:27.511
I THINK IS MORE SIGNIFICANT.

00:52:27.577 --> 00:52:28.645
PEOPLE WANT ONE OF KNOWLEDGE

00:52:28.712 --> 00:52:30.680
WITH THAT SO IT IS THE

00:52:30.747 --> 00:52:32.649
GATEKEEPER THE MONEY- BUT I'VE

00:52:32.716 --> 00:52:34.050
NEVER REALLY SEEN A FOCUS MY

00:52:34.117 --> 00:52:36.253
SEVEN YEARS HERE. ON THAT PART

00:52:36.319 --> 00:52:36.786
AND OBVIOUSLY WHEN YOU'RE

00:52:36.853 --> 00:52:38.722
DRIVING DOWNTOWN. ANYWHERE ELSE

00:52:38.788 --> 00:52:40.891
IN CALIFORNIA- YOU SEE FOLKS OR

00:52:40.957 --> 00:52:43.126
SEVERELY MENTALLY ILL. AND WE

00:52:43.193 --> 00:52:52.102
WILL NOT PUT A DENT IN THAT. SO.

00:52:52.168 --> 00:52:53.470
LAST QUESTION. I MEAN A NO

00:52:53.537 --> 00:52:54.504
PLACE LIKE HOME PRO. IS BASED

00:52:54.571 --> 00:52:55.505
TO PAY. WHO ARE MENTALLY ILL.

00:52:55.572 --> 00:52:57.240
AND I. HOME RIGHT INTO THE

00:52:57.307 --> 00:52:58.341
THEIR PROP TO PASS A COUPLE

00:52:58.408 --> 00:52:59.509
YEARS AGO. THERE IS- NEAR TWO

00:52:59.576 --> 00:53:01.111
BILLION DOLLARS. MADE AVAILABLE

00:53:01.177 --> 00:53:02.812
AND WE HAVE. OVERBILLING OF

00:53:02.879 --> 00:53:05.215
THAT ALREADY AND- FOR NEW

00:53:05.282 --> 00:53:06.082
HOUSING UP BECAUSE THAT IS THE

00:58:50.526 --> 00:58:52.028
HOUSES AS MANY FOLKS AS YOU

STATE IS PROVIDING TWO YEARS OF

00:59:11.414 --> 00:59:13.383
CAPITALIZE RESERVES AND THEN

00:59:13.449 --> 00:59:15.018
THE EXPECTATION IS THAT LOCALS

00:59:15.084 --> 00:59:16.819
ARE HANDLING THE REMAINDER OF

00:59:16.886 --> 00:59:19.422
THAT FIVE YEARS- DO YOU HAVE

00:59:19.489 --> 00:59:20.823
COST ESTIMATES OF WHAT IT WOULD

00:59:20.890 --> 00:59:22.625
COST TO CAPITALIZE RESERVES FOR

00:59:22.692 --> 00:59:25.194
THE TYPICAL LIFESPAN OF A

00:59:25.261 --> 00:59:26.296
PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING

00:59:26.362 --> 00:59:28.364

A GREAT QUESTION- SO IT'S A

00:59:42.078 --> 00:59:43.179
DIFFICULT ONE TO ANSWER BECAUSE

00:59:43.246 --> 00:59:44.547
IT DOES DEPEND ON THE PROJECT

00:59:44.614 --> 00:59:47.917

TO MAKE SURE THESE PROJECTS FOR

01:00:00.463 --> 01:00:01.764
SUSTAINABLE ONE REAL. AND I WAS

01:00:01.831 --> 01:00:03.666
HE THAT WAS BASED ON. YOU KNOW

01:00:03.733 --> 01:00:05.501
THE ANALYSIS THAT AND THAT THAT

01:00:05.568 --> 01:00:10.573
THE PREVIOUSLY LEARNED RIGHT-

01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:11.975
SO I'LL HAVE GUNS WERE HOUSING

01:00:12.041 --> 01:00:13.943
DEVELOPMENTS IN. AND PROGRAMS

01:00:14.010 --> 01:00:16.980
IT IS SO- TO YOUR QUESTION

01:00:17.046 --> 01:00:19.716
QUITE OFTEN. A PROJECTS WILL BE

01:00:19.782 --> 01:00:21.584
SEEKING OUT VOUCHERS TO HELP

01:00:21.651 --> 01:00:22.952
SUBSIDIZE AS WELL THOSE MIGHT

01:00:23.019 --> 01:00:24.354
BE AS PEOPLE WHO ARE

01:00:24.420 --> 01:00:25.421
AFFECTIONATE DOCTORS OR THEY

01:00:25.488 --> 01:00:27.490
MAY BE- OTHERS ABOUT YOURS FOR

01:00:27.557 --> 01:00:28.758
VETERANS AND THOSE SORTS OF

01:00:28.825 --> 01:00:29.726
THINGS SO PROJECTS ARE ABLE TO

01:00:29.792 --> 01:00:31.661
ACCESS THOSE EITHER THROUGH

01:00:31.728 --> 01:00:32.662
INDIVIDUAL TENANTS HAVING

01:00:32.729 --> 01:00:34.364
VOUCHERS OR WHAT WE CALL

01:00:34.430 --> 01:00:35.965
PROJECT BASING OF THOSE DOCTORS

01:00:36.032 --> 01:00:37.533
MEANING THE- THE SUBSIDY IS

01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:40.003
TIED TO THE- APARTMENT OR UNIT

01:00:40.069 --> 01:00:41.671
RATHER THAN THE PERSON. THAT

01:00:41.738 --> 01:00:43.106
CAN CHANGE THE DYNAMIC OF WHAT

01:00:43.172 --> 01:00:44.874
MIGHT BE NECESSARY FROM AN

01:00:44.941 --> 01:00:46.242
OPERATING SUBSIDY RIGHT BECAUSE

01:00:46.309 --> 01:00:49.579
THE MORE INCOME COMING INTO THE

01:00:49.645 --> 01:00:51.114
PROJECT THE LESS THAT- ABILITY.

01:00:51.180 --> 01:00:52.548
IS NO PLACE LIKE HOME RIGHT

01:00:52.615 --> 01:00:54.517
WHERE WE WILL CAPITALIZE OF

01:00:54.584 --> 01:00:57.587
FRONTS- EIGHTY AN AMOUNT IS

01:00:57.653 --> 01:00:59.589
TYPICALLY TIED TO THE UNIT. IT

01:00:59.655 --> 01:01:01.324
CAN BE DRAWN DOWN FROM OVER THE

01:01:01.391 --> 01:01:03.059
COURSE OF MANY MANY YEARS. THAT

01:01:03.126 --> 01:01:04.160
AMOUNT OF COURSE LIKE I SAID

01:01:04.227 --> 01:01:05.862
CAN DIFFER BASED ON THE

01:01:05.928 --> 01:01:09.532
ANALYSIS OF WHAT OTHER. INCOMES

01:01:09.599 --> 01:01:11.434
OR RESOURCES ARE COMING. AND TO

01:01:11.501 --> 01:01:12.168
HOLD THE MOST COMMON MIGHT BE

01:01:12.235 --> 01:01:15.038
DOCTORS SO. WHAT WE DID EVEN

01:01:15.104 --> 01:01:16.239
WITHIN THE INITIAL HOME HE IS

01:01:16.305 --> 01:01:18.374
THERE OR DIFFERENT RESOURCES

01:01:18.441 --> 01:01:20.410
AVAILABLE TO EACH PROJECT AND

01:01:20.476 --> 01:01:22.211
SO THE WAY WE STRUCTURED YOU

01:01:22.278 --> 01:01:23.379
KNOW LUCKILY WERE ABLE TO

01:01:23.446 --> 01:01:25.114
PROVIDE. A INITIAL COUPLE THE

01:01:25.181 --> 01:01:27.917
FEELING WE AS YOU MAY RECALL

01:01:27.984 --> 01:01:28.851
ONLY HAD FIFTY MILLION GENERAL

01:01:28.918 --> 01:01:31.587
FUND. UP TO SPREAD ACROSS ALL

01:01:31.654 --> 01:01:34.590
ALL OF THOSE PROJECTS AND SO-

01:01:34.657 --> 01:01:36.159
IT DOES VERY DEPENDING UPON

01:01:36.225 --> 01:01:37.493
WHAT OTHER SOURCES OF INCOME

01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:38.895
THEY'RE GOING TO BE OVER AGAIN

01:01:38.961 --> 01:01:40.463
AND THE OTHER ASPECT THERE IS.

01:01:40.530 --> 01:01:43.433
WHEN YOU HAVE SOME OF THESE

01:01:43.499 --> 01:01:45.501
PROPERTIES. THAT ARE OPERATING

01:01:45.568 --> 01:01:46.536
IN TERM HOUSING COMMUNITIES

01:01:46.602 --> 01:01:47.170
CHOSE TO OPERATE THEM AS

01:01:47.236 --> 01:01:48.337
INTERIM HOUSING FOR A SHORT

01:01:48.404 --> 01:01:49.739
PERIOD OF TIME BECAUSE THEY HAD

01:01:49.806 --> 01:01:52.075
A REAL NEED- FROM A SHELTER

01:01:52.141 --> 01:01:53.509
BASED STANDPOINT WHEN

01:01:53.576 --> 01:01:54.677
ESPECIALLY BECAUSE WE'RE TRYING

01:01:54.744 --> 01:01:56.145
TO COPE WITH NEED TO GET PEOPLE

01:01:56.212 --> 01:01:57.847
IN THE SIX SPACES- THEY'RE

01:01:57.914 --> 01:01:58.848
GOING TO BE OVER TIME

01:01:58.915 --> 01:01:59.916
CONVERTING THERE'S NO PERMANENT

01:01:59.982 --> 01:02:00.850
HOUSING IN WHICH CASE THEY'RE

01:02:00.917 --> 01:02:01.717
GOING TO BE RECEIVING SOME

01:02:01.784 --> 01:02:03.086
PROGRAMMING CAN EVEN OTHERS

01:02:03.152 --> 01:02:05.288
RENTS ARE LOW- THAT DOES CHANGE

01:02:05.354 --> 01:02:07.356
CHANGE THE DYNAMIC. AND SO IT

01:02:07.423 --> 01:02:08.825
IS TRUE COMMITTEES ARE GOING TO

01:02:08.891 --> 01:02:11.060
HAVE TO MAKE SOME CHOICES. ARE

01:02:11.127 --> 01:02:12.695
AROUND THEIR RESOURCES WHAT

01:02:12.762 --> 01:02:14.430
LUCKILY THERE ARE NUMBER OF

01:02:14.497 --> 01:02:17.200
RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO THEM.

01:02:17.266 --> 01:02:19.402
LIKE MANY NATIVE SOURCES WITHIN

01:02:19.469 --> 01:02:21.637
THAT RIGHT THEY USE THEIR-

01:02:21.704 --> 01:02:23.372

THEIR PERMANENT HOUSING LOCAL

01:02:31.614 --> 01:02:33.116
ALLOCATION PLAN FOR THE ONGOING

01:02:33.182 --> 01:02:34.317
SOURCE THAT COMES FROM THE

THAT SOURCE OF HOUSING SO THERE

01:02:37.186 --> 01:02:39.155
ARE. A NUMBER OF SOURCES

01:02:39.222 --> 01:02:41.324
AVAILABLE TO JURISDICTIONS.

01:02:41.390 --> 01:02:43.392
THAT THEY TAPPED INTO. IT IS

01:02:43.459 --> 01:02:44.961
ENTIRELY CORRECT THEY ARE GOING

01:02:45.027 --> 01:02:46.162
TO HAVE TO CONTINUE TO MAKE

01:02:46.229 --> 01:02:48.531
SOME CHOICES HERE- IN AN

01:02:48.598 --> 01:02:50.366
ONGOING WAY ABOUT HOW THEY

OPERATE THOSE ALTHOUGH. I WILL

01:02:52.168 --> 01:02:53.369
SAY FOR SUPPORTIVE HOUSING

01:02:53.436 --> 01:02:54.704
DEVELOPERS FOR COMMUNITIES WHO

01:02:54.770 --> 01:02:56.439
ARE DEALING WITH THIS. THAT IS

01:02:56.506 --> 01:02:58.307
FAIRLY. THAT'S A KNOWN THING

01:02:58.374 --> 01:03:01.077
QUITE TYPICAL WHEN THEIR-

01:03:01.144 --> 01:03:02.612
ASSESSING HOW TO BEST USE THEIR

01:03:02.678 --> 01:03:03.813
HOMELESSNESS FUNDS THEY'RE

01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:08.851
OFTEN GOING TO CONTINUE.

01:03:08.918 --> 01:03:10.153

IS WE WANT TO SET THIS UP FOR

01:03:15.491 --> 01:03:17.360
FIVE AND THEN IT SORT OF. GOOD

01:03:17.426 --> 01:03:19.362
LUCK TO THE LOCALS TO FIGURE

01:03:19.428 --> 01:03:22.231
THIS OUT- I GUESS WHAT I WORE

01:03:22.298 --> 01:03:23.299
WHAT WHAT I WHAT I LIKE TO SAY

01:03:23.366 --> 01:03:24.667
IS THERE MANY OF US IN THE

01:03:24.734 --> 01:03:28.571
LEGISLATURE. WHO VERY MUCH

01:03:28.638 --> 01:03:29.372
APPRECIATE IN THE LAST FEW. WE

01:03:29.438 --> 01:03:30.339
HAVE MADE SO ONE TIME AND

01:03:30.406 --> 01:03:32.542
THAT'S AND HOMELESSNESS BUT WE

01:03:32.608 --> 01:03:34.210
HAVE NOT WE VERY MUCH WOULD

01:03:34.277 --> 01:03:36.179
LIKE TO SEE AN ONGOING

01:03:36.245 --> 01:03:38.314
INVESTMENT AND AN INABILITY FOR

01:03:38.381 --> 01:03:39.649
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO RELY ON

01:03:39.715 --> 01:03:41.284
GOING FUNDING. THERE AS YOU

01:03:41.350 --> 01:03:43.419
KNOW A DISCUSSION AT THIS

01:03:43.486 --> 01:03:44.987
MOMENT ABOUT HOW WE COULD

01:03:45.054 --> 01:03:46.022
CREATE A PERMANENT SOURCE OF

01:03:46.088 --> 01:03:47.657
FUNDING FOR HOMELESSNESS

01:03:47.723 --> 01:03:50.159
BECAUSE OF THE REALITY IS-

01:03:50.226 --> 01:03:51.861
MAYBE WE HAVE ENOUGH MONEY

01:03:51.928 --> 01:03:53.429
BETWEEN LOCALS AND THE STATE TO

01:03:53.496 --> 01:03:54.063
PROP THIS UP FOR THE NEXT FEW

01:03:54.130 --> 01:03:56.499
YEARS BUT LONG TERM WE DON'T

01:03:56.566 --> 01:03:58.634
HAVE A PLAN. I'M WONDERING WHAT

01:03:58.701 --> 01:04:00.069
YOUR THOUGHTS ARE ON THE IDEA

01:04:00.136 --> 01:04:01.904
OF BEING ABLE TO COMMIT LONGER

01:04:01.971 --> 01:04:04.540
TERM ONGOING FUNDING- WHETHER

01:04:04.607 --> 01:04:06.475
WOULD MAKE SENSE FOR US TO HAVE

01:04:06.542 --> 01:04:07.076
A PERMANENT SOURCE OF FUNDING

01:04:07.143 --> 01:04:08.878
FOR HOMELESSNESS. AND- JUST

01:04:08.945 --> 01:04:09.946
ALSO JUST CONTEXTUALIZE THE

01:04:10.012 --> 01:04:11.881
NUMBERS YOU KNOW THE NUMBERS

01:04:11.948 --> 01:04:14.984
WITH PROJECT- RICKY IN HOMELESS

01:04:15.051 --> 01:04:16.886
AND HOCKEY WERE REPRESSIVE FOR

01:04:16.953 --> 01:04:19.222
THE SHORT TERM- BUT- WE'RE

01:04:19.288 --> 01:04:20.523
TALKING ABOUT THOUSANDS IN A

01:04:20.590 --> 01:04:21.624
COUPLE INSTANCES TENS OF

01:04:21.691 --> 01:04:23.626
THOUSANDS BUT WE'VE GOT OVER A

01:04:23.693 --> 01:04:24.860
HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND FOLKS.

01:04:24.927 --> 01:04:27.129
SO WE ARE TAKING CARE OF YOU

01:04:27.196 --> 01:04:29.332
KNOW- IT IS A PERCENTAGE OF THE

01:04:29.398 --> 01:04:31.367
PROBLEM BUT BUT SAY 10% OF THE

01:04:31.434 --> 01:04:33.302
PROBLEM WE HAVE A LOT MORE OF

01:04:33.369 --> 01:04:35.271
THE CHALLENGE TO ADDRESS AND I

01:04:35.338 --> 01:04:35.738
THINK THIS GETS AT THE

01:04:35.805 --> 01:04:37.773
FRUSTRATION MANY OF US HAVE.

01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:39.909
THAT WE ARE NOT. HAVING THE BIG

01:04:39.976 --> 01:04:41.577
PICTURE CONVERSATION THAT WE

01:04:41.644 --> 01:04:43.145
NEED TO BROWN ONGOING FUNDING

01:04:43.212 --> 01:04:44.280
PERMANENT SOURCES OF FUNDING

01:04:44.347 --> 01:04:46.082
AND HOW TO REALLY GRAPPLE WITH

01:04:46.148 --> 01:04:56.926
THE. BIG PICTURE. YOUR THOUGHTS.

01:04:56.993 --> 01:04:58.761
SORRY ABOUT THAT IT IT WELL

WE CAN- I MEAN. VERY PLEASED AT

01:05:06.535 --> 01:05:07.970
WORK AND HOME HE THAT I MEAN

01:05:08.037 --> 01:05:09.639
YES THE SCOPE OF OUR PROBLEM IS

01:05:09.705 --> 01:05:11.107
SIGNIFICANT BUT SIX THOUSAND

01:05:11.173 --> 01:05:12.241
UNITS ONLINE SEARCH FOR PERIOD

01:05:12.308 --> 01:05:13.976
IS. IS QUITE SIGNIFICANT I MEAN

01:05:14.043 --> 01:05:15.611
I DON'T THINK WE I THINK THAT'S

01:05:15.678 --> 01:05:18.381
WHAT I WANT TO DO MORE OF IT-

01:05:18.447 --> 01:05:19.815
YOU KNOW I WILL SAY A COUPLE

01:05:19.882 --> 01:05:21.517
THOUGHTS HERE. HAVING WORKED IN

01:05:21.584 --> 01:05:23.119
THIS FIELD FOR QUITE A WHILE A

01:05:23.185 --> 01:05:24.387
LONG TIME AND MAYBE I'M

01:05:24.453 --> 01:05:25.488
EXPOSING THE DIRTY LITTLE

01:05:25.554 --> 01:05:27.556
SECRET BUT- NEVER. IN THE

01:05:27.623 --> 01:05:28.991
INITIAL FOR SUPPORT HOUSING

01:05:29.058 --> 01:05:30.960
PROGRAMS THE STATE EMPLOYED IT

01:05:31.027 --> 01:05:32.628
WE ACTUALLY BEEN REQUIRE-

01:05:32.695 --> 01:05:35.998
OPERATING. RESERVES OR THE WAY

01:05:36.065 --> 01:05:37.199
THAT WE ASK FOR HUNKY RIGHT

01:05:37.266 --> 01:05:38.267
MAYBE THAT THEIR TERRIBLE

01:05:38.334 --> 01:05:40.069
SECRET BUT IT WAS QUITE COMMON.

01:05:40.136 --> 01:05:41.570
AND IS QUITE COMMON FOR SUPPORT

01:05:41.637 --> 01:05:42.905
HOUSING DEVELOPERS TO BE HAVING

01:05:42.972 --> 01:05:44.807
TO FIGURE OUT THAT. EVERY

01:05:44.874 --> 01:05:45.941
COUPLE YOU KNOW EVERY COUPLE

01:05:46.008 --> 01:05:47.443
YEARS BECAUSE LOCAL COMMITMENTS

01:05:47.510 --> 01:05:48.544
WORKING YOUR COMMENTS YOU'RE

01:05:48.611 --> 01:05:49.845
GETTING WITH CARE. ARE

01:05:49.912 --> 01:05:51.147
HAPPENING ON AN ANNUAL BASIS

01:05:51.213 --> 01:05:53.282
RIGHT COUNTY CITIES. IN THE

01:05:53.349 --> 01:05:54.850
CARE AREN'T WILLING HERE NOT

01:05:54.917 --> 01:05:56.285
SAYING WE'RE GOING TO COMMIT

01:05:56.352 --> 01:05:57.386
TEN TWENTY YEARS. RIGHT THAT'S

01:05:57.453 --> 01:05:58.220
WHY NO PLACE LIKE HOME SO

01:05:58.287 --> 01:06:00.356
SIGNIFICANT. IN THE COUNTIES

01:06:00.423 --> 01:06:02.091

YEARS. OF OPERATING SUPPORT AND

01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:05.928
SERVICES. STILL TRIED TO BUILD

01:06:05.995 --> 01:06:07.697
ON THAT- OBVIOUSLY COULD DO

01:06:07.763 --> 01:06:09.665
MORE. I WOULD LIKE TO DO MORE I

01:06:09.732 --> 01:06:10.533
THINK WITH GENERAL FUND

01:06:10.599 --> 01:06:18.341
RESOURCES CAN DO. MORE BECAUSE

01:06:18.407 --> 01:06:19.141
WE HAVE MORE FLEXIBILITY IN.

01:06:19.208 --> 01:06:20.309
THAT'S WHY THAT'S WHAT ONE BUT

01:06:20.376 --> 01:06:21.410
WONDERFUL CERTAINLY MORE THESE

01:06:21.477 --> 01:06:24.413
PRO. TO BE BY HAVE. HELP AND

01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:25.848
THAT'S WHY WE- GET AS MUCH AS

WE COULD YOU KNOW WHAT. WITH

01:06:26.649 --> 01:06:27.350
THE- RESOURCES THAT WERE

YOU'RE VERY COMMITTED TO FIGURE

01:08:09.285 --> 01:08:10.186

ABOUT MORE REVENUES BUT WE'RE

01:08:14.824 --> 01:08:15.558
REALLY NOT HAVING THAT

01:08:15.624 --> 01:08:16.659
CONVERSATION ABOUT MORE

01:08:16.725 --> 01:08:17.827
REVENUES WERE HERE AND ON THE

01:08:17.893 --> 01:08:18.961
OTHER HAND. THERE'S NOT GONNA

01:08:19.028 --> 01:08:20.129
BE DISCUSSION AROUND A

01:08:20.196 --> 01:08:20.896
PERMANENT SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR

01:08:20.963 --> 01:08:23.566
HOMELESSNESS- WE NEED TO FIGURE

01:08:23.632 --> 01:08:25.935
OUT WHAT ONGOING FUNDING IS

01:08:26.001 --> 01:08:27.102
GOING TO LOOK LIKE IF WE'RE

01:08:27.169 --> 01:08:28.671
GONNA BE ABLE TO CREDIBLY TELL.

01:08:28.737 --> 01:08:29.905
CALIFORNIANS THAT WE HAVE A

01:08:29.972 --> 01:08:31.273
PLAN. TO ACTUALLY AND

01:08:31.340 --> 01:08:33.008
HOMELESSNESS IN OUR LIFETIME OR

01:08:33.075 --> 01:08:35.511
IN A GENERATION SO- I LOOK

01:08:35.578 --> 01:08:36.579
FORWARD TO THAT CONVERSATION I

01:08:36.645 --> 01:08:38.314
JUST HOPE THAT WE WILL REALLY.

01:08:38.380 --> 01:08:39.982
REALLY ENGAGE IN AND WHAT THIS

01:08:40.049 --> 01:08:41.717
ALL MEANS- THESE ARE PROGRAMS

01:08:41.784 --> 01:08:43.285
THAT HAVE BEEN IMPORTANT. IN

01:08:43.352 --> 01:08:44.820
THE SHORT TERM DURING CHRONIC

01:08:44.887 --> 01:08:46.355
VIRUS BUT I THINK. UNLESS WE

01:08:46.422 --> 01:08:48.123
REALLY STAND THEM UP WITH A

01:08:48.190 --> 01:08:50.226
SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT. WE'RE

01:08:50.292 --> 01:08:52.461
NOT GONNA HAVE A SHOT AT ENDING

01:08:52.528 --> 01:08:53.662
HOMELESSNESS WITHIN OUR OUR

01:08:53.729 --> 01:08:55.498
LIFETIMES. OF MILLION AND

01:08:55.564 --> 01:08:59.768
MILLION WITH. ONE FINAL

01:08:59.835 --> 01:09:00.803
QUESTION- S. MINISTRATION THING

01:09:00.870 --> 01:09:01.570
ABOUT A LONG TERM. FOR PROJECT

01:09:01.637 --> 01:09:03.672
HOME KEY. HOW WILL YOU HELP

01:09:03.739 --> 01:09:05.508
EACH CITY REALLY MEASURE. THE

01:09:05.574 --> 01:09:07.710
SUCCESS OF THE PROGRAM I NOTE

01:09:07.776 --> 01:09:09.311
FROM THE L. A- NOW SAYS THAT

01:09:09.378 --> 01:09:11.046
WHEN HE CAME TO. PROJECT ROOM

01:09:11.113 --> 01:09:13.983
KEY. THAT PROJECTS EXPERIENCED

01:09:14.049 --> 01:09:16.118
LOW OCCUPANCY RATES AMONG LEAST

01:09:16.185 --> 01:09:18.287
UNITS AND- IT HAD A LOT OF

01:09:18.354 --> 01:09:20.756
CHALLENGES AND JUST CURIOUS.

01:09:20.823 --> 01:09:22.124
HOW WILL YOU MEASURE THE

01:09:22.191 --> 01:09:24.527
SUCCESS OF THISPROGRAM IN A

01:09:24.593 --> 01:09:25.861
COUPLE OF YEARS WHAT WHAT

01:09:25.928 --> 01:09:28.430
METRICS SHOULD WE BE LOOKING

01:09:28.497 --> 01:09:29.031
FOR THAT YOU'RE GOING TO FOCUS

01:09:29.098 --> 01:09:35.437
ON. SURE SO NO WE- DEFINITELY

01:09:35.504 --> 01:09:36.972
IT JUST TO BE CLEAR VERY

01:09:37.039 --> 01:09:38.173
DIFFERENT PROGRAM I KNOW THEY

01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:39.642
GET TIED TOGETHER QUITE OFTEN

01:09:39.708 --> 01:09:41.243
IN OUR DIALOGUE BUT ON VERY

01:09:41.310 --> 01:09:42.645
DIFFERENT KIND OF MECHANISM FOR

01:09:42.711 --> 01:09:43.846
WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE WE'RE

01:09:43.913 --> 01:09:46.348
PROVIDING. THROUGH HOKEY YOU

01:09:46.415 --> 01:09:47.449
KNOW PERMANENT HOUSING

01:09:47.516 --> 01:09:49.151
SOLUTIONS RIGHT- THAT AS

01:09:49.218 --> 01:09:51.387
OPPOSED TO TEMPORARY. SO JUST

01:09:51.453 --> 01:09:52.855
AS WE WILL IT AS AS WE WOULD

01:09:52.922 --> 01:09:54.657
FOR OTHER TYPES OF HOUSING

01:09:54.723 --> 01:09:56.158
PROGRAMS ESPECIALLY SUPPORTER

01:09:56.225 --> 01:09:57.927
HOUSING PROGRAMS. YOU'RE

01:09:57.993 --> 01:10:00.396
LOOKING AT THE OF COURSE

01:10:00.462 --> 01:10:04.099
OCCUPANCY RATES AND TURNOVER-

01:10:04.166 --> 01:10:06.335
YOU KNOW. I'M NOT CONCERNED.

01:10:06.402 --> 01:10:08.070
FROM THE- REPORTS THEY BECAUSE

01:10:08.137 --> 01:10:09.972
WITH SO MUCH DEMAND ABOUT THERE

01:10:10.039 --> 01:10:12.107
BEING FULL OCCUPANCY OF ALL

01:10:12.174 --> 01:10:14.209
THESE PROJECTS- YOU'RE LOOKING

01:10:14.276 --> 01:10:17.613
AT- BUT THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S

01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:18.581
ONE OF THE METRIC STYLE I WOULD

01:10:18.647 --> 01:10:20.482
I WOULD SUGGEST RIGHT AND I DO

01:10:20.549 --> 01:10:21.216
THINK IT IS IMPORTANT I DID

01:10:21.283 --> 01:10:23.018
MENTION IT A LITTLE BIT I DON'T

01:10:23.085 --> 01:10:24.587
THINK WE DO A GOOD ENOUGH JOB.

01:10:24.653 --> 01:10:26.956
TALKING ABOUT INVESTMENT AND

01:10:27.022 --> 01:10:28.457
WITH THAT SHE WAS OVER A LONG

01:10:28.524 --> 01:10:30.793
TERM. WE OFTEN TALK ABOUT THE

01:10:30.859 --> 01:10:32.294
PER UNIT COST OF SOMETHING

01:10:32.361 --> 01:10:33.395
WHETHER BE NEW CONSTRUCTION OR

01:10:33.462 --> 01:10:34.563
SOMETHING EVEN MUCH MORE

01:10:34.630 --> 01:10:36.765
AFFORDABLE ABOUT ACQUISITION.

01:10:36.832 --> 01:10:39.001
BUT WE DON'T. TAKE IN YOUR MIND

01:10:39.068 --> 01:10:39.668
THE FACT THAT WE'RE SERVING

01:10:39.735 --> 01:10:41.503
HOUSEHOLDS FOR FIFTY FIVE YEARS

01:10:41.570 --> 01:10:43.439
IN MOST CASES WITH THE SUPPORT.

01:10:43.505 --> 01:10:44.940
SO THAT'S LIKE MANY MANY MANY

01:10:45.007 --> 01:10:46.875
HOUSEHOLDS OVER THAT TIME. THAT

01:10:46.942 --> 01:10:48.043
GOES TO YOUR POINT AND THE

01:10:48.110 --> 01:10:49.311
POINT OF OTHERS AROUND MAKING

01:10:49.378 --> 01:10:50.479
SURE THESE ARE FIFTEEN. THE WAY

01:10:50.546 --> 01:10:52.514
WE DO THAT- I WOULD POSIT IS BY

01:10:52.581 --> 01:10:54.617
CAPITALIZING OPERATING SUBSIDY

01:10:54.683 --> 01:10:55.684
RESEARCHERS. AT THE AT THE

01:10:55.751 --> 01:10:58.287
OUTSET- THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE

01:10:58.354 --> 01:10:59.388
BEEN BUILDING INTO ALL OF OUR

01:10:59.455 --> 01:11:00.889
SUPPORT OF HOUSING PROGRAMS IN

01:11:00.956 --> 01:11:03.058
RECENT YEARS. AND HAPPY THAT

01:11:03.125 --> 01:11:05.260
WE'VE- BEEN ABLE TO DO THAT- I

01:11:05.327 --> 01:11:06.362
THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE WAYS

01:11:06.428 --> 01:11:08.464
YOU CAN. PROVIDE THAT

01:11:08.530 --> 01:11:10.799
SUSTAINABILITY AND THAT

01:11:10.866 --> 01:11:13.736
CERTAINTY. OBJECT LEVEL- WE

01:11:13.802 --> 01:11:14.803
WILL CONTINUE TO THAT CERTAINLY

01:11:14.870 --> 01:11:16.205
HELP KEEP ANY ANY SUPPORTER

01:11:16.271 --> 01:11:18.240
HOUSING KIND OF APPROACH I

01:11:18.307 --> 01:11:19.508
WOULD RECOMMEND THAT INCLUDES

01:11:19.575 --> 01:11:21.043
SOMETHING LIKE THAT SO YOU'RE

01:11:21.110 --> 01:11:23.212
NOT ONLY FINANCING THE NEW

01:11:23.278 --> 01:11:24.580
CONSTRUCTION OR TICKETS TO THE

01:11:24.647 --> 01:11:25.781
ACQUISITION WHICH ARE ALSO

01:11:25.848 --> 01:11:27.149
CAPITALIZING AND A ONE TIME

01:11:27.216 --> 01:11:29.184
TIME UP FRONT ITS OPERATING

01:11:29.251 --> 01:11:30.819
RESERVE THAT CAN BE DRAWN FROM

01:11:30.886 --> 01:11:31.687
OVERTIME SO I THINK THAT'S A

01:11:31.754 --> 01:11:33.956
BEST PRACTICE THAT WE WOULD

01:11:34.023 --> 01:11:37.092
LIKE. SO AGAIN I HEAR THAT WHAT

01:11:37.159 --> 01:11:38.594
YOU'RE SAYING IS. THAT YOU

01:11:38.661 --> 01:11:39.828
SHOULD THE THAT YOU SHOULD GET

01:11:39.895 --> 01:11:40.863
CREDIT FOR THE FACT THAT WE

01:11:40.929 --> 01:11:43.132
ARE. MAKING AN INVESTMENT FOR

01:11:43.198 --> 01:11:44.166
FIFTY FIVE YEARS AND YET WE

01:11:44.233 --> 01:11:45.134
ONLY HAVE A PLAN TO PAY FOR THE

01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:49.204
FIRST. FIVE SPRITE SO. THAT

01:11:49.271 --> 01:11:51.507
AGAIN TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT

01:11:51.573 --> 01:11:52.941
THE LONG TERM PLAN IS AND I

01:11:53.008 --> 01:11:54.309
DON'T SEE IT YET AND I THINK

01:11:54.376 --> 01:11:56.278
MANY OF US. ARE EAGER TO ENGAGE

01:11:56.345 --> 01:11:58.580
IN THAT CONVERSATION OF AGAIN

01:11:58.647 --> 01:11:59.748
ONGOING FUNDING PERMANENT

01:11:59.815 --> 01:12:01.183
SOURCE OF FUNDING FUNDING THAT

01:12:01.250 --> 01:12:03.185
IS ADEQUATE TO MEET THE NEED-

01:12:03.252 --> 01:12:04.586
WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT- AT

01:12:04.653 --> 01:12:06.689
THIS MOMENT SCRATCHING 5210% OF

01:12:06.755 --> 01:12:13.796
THAT. OKAY I'LL BE HAPPY TO

01:12:13.862 --> 01:12:16.231
WORK WITH YOU- THE NUMBER IT'S-

01:12:16.298 --> 01:12:18.100
I WOULD SAY YOU KNOW. HOW THE

01:12:18.167 --> 01:12:19.601
PROCESS CAN BE COMPLICATED

01:12:19.668 --> 01:12:20.402
THERE ARE RESOURCES OF COURSE

01:12:20.469 --> 01:12:21.770
AVAILABLE TO DO THAT IF YOU

01:12:21.837 --> 01:12:23.672
LOOK AT. HOW WE LOST SUPPORT OF

01:12:23.739 --> 01:12:24.707
HOUSING PROJECTS HAVE BECOME

01:12:24.773 --> 01:12:26.075
OFFLINE IF THEY'RE BUILT TWENTY

01:12:26.141 --> 01:12:27.076
YEARS AGO YOU KNOW THE ANSWER I

01:12:27.142 --> 01:12:28.711
THINK IT BY ACROSS WHAT'S NOW.

01:12:28.777 --> 01:12:30.746
RIGHT WE HAVE AS COMMUNITIES

01:12:30.813 --> 01:12:32.848
AS- THROUGH THE VARIOUS

01:12:32.915 --> 01:12:34.016
RESOURCES AVAILABLE AT THE

01:12:34.083 --> 01:12:35.884
LOCAL STATE FEDERAL LEVEL-

01:12:35.951 --> 01:12:37.252
MAINTAIN THOSE PROPERTIES THERE

01:12:37.319 --> 01:12:38.854
ARE. RESOURCES OF COURSE

01:12:38.921 --> 01:12:40.689
THROUGH A REHABILITATION TO TAX

01:12:40.756 --> 01:12:42.057
CREDITS THAT OFF AND ON YOU

01:12:42.124 --> 01:12:43.192
KNOW FIFTEEN YEARS INTO THE

01:12:43.258 --> 01:12:44.793
PROJECT OR THINGS LIKE THAT SO.

01:12:44.860 --> 01:12:45.961
I WOULD EXPECT WE WOULD SEE

PROGRAM- THE NEED FOR GIVING-

01:19:38.940 --> 01:19:40.742
FUNDING- BASICALLY SOONEST. AS

01:19:40.809 --> 01:19:43.545
POSSIBLE FOR- INTO

01:19:43.612 --> 01:19:44.146
INFRASTRUCTURE WE SEE IS VERY

01:19:44.212 --> 01:19:45.914
IMPORTANT- AND THAT HAPPENED TO

01:19:45.981 --> 01:19:49.718
YOU- I REFERRED BACK TO EIGHTY

01:19:49.784 --> 01:19:54.089
ANYTHING ELSE ACT. I KNOW I

01:19:54.156 --> 01:19:55.457
WOULD JUST ADD TO THAT THINKING

01:19:55.524 --> 01:19:57.526
I WOULD JUST ADD TO THAT- BASED

01:19:57.592 --> 01:19:59.494
ON THE NUMBERS WE WERE ALMOST

01:19:59.561 --> 01:20:01.263
AND- I HAD A PERCENT

01:20:01.329 --> 01:20:04.299
OVERSUBSCRIBED. IN THE EFFORT

01:20:04.366 --> 01:20:06.635
THAT WE ISSUED IN TWO THOUSAND

01:20:06.701 --> 01:20:09.004
AND LATE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN-

01:20:09.070 --> 01:20:10.138
SO WE ANTICIPATE THOSE

01:20:10.205 --> 01:20:13.608
PROJECTS- BUT I'LL BE MOVING

01:20:13.675 --> 01:20:14.209
FORWARD. UNDER THIS PROGRAM AS

01:20:14.276 --> 01:20:18.446
WELL. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. I

01:20:19.581 --> 01:20:20.849
QUESTION RELATED TO YOUR

01:20:20.916 --> 01:20:22.851

OVER SUBSCRIPTION OF THE

01:20:24.052 --> 01:20:25.720
PROGRAM IF IT HAS WHY WOULD WE

01:20:25.787 --> 01:20:27.355
CHANGE THE FOCUS TO BROWN FILLS

01:20:27.422 --> 01:20:30.225
OF THERE IS STILL A NEED FOR

01:20:30.292 --> 01:20:32.694
THE CORE. I. I. G. PROGRAM. SO

01:20:32.761 --> 01:20:34.496
CURRENTLY THAT HISTORIC THE

01:20:34.563 --> 01:20:36.498
HISTORICAL PROGRAM. HAS

01:20:36.565 --> 01:20:38.900
PROVIDED SOME FUNDING FOR

01:20:38.967 --> 01:20:40.368
ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION BUT

01:20:40.435 --> 01:20:43.605
THE PROGRAM CAPS. THE USE OF

01:20:43.672 --> 01:20:44.873
PROGRAM FUNDS FOR THAT PURPOSE

01:20:44.940 --> 01:20:46.608
THAT ABOUT. 20% OF THE TOTAL

REALLY GET TO. THE REQUIRED

01:20:52.247 --> 01:20:54.149
REMEDIATION FOR SOME OF THESE

01:20:54.216 --> 01:20:56.117

SITE SAID THIS. THIS FUNDING

01:20:58.853 --> 01:20:59.554
FOR THE BROWNFIELDS BUT REALLY

FOCUSED IN ON THOSE SITES THAT

01:21:01.890 --> 01:21:03.792
ARE MORE DIFFICULT TO DEVELOP.

01:21:03.858 --> 01:21:04.993
BUT YET HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY

01:21:05.060 --> 01:21:07.529

TOUCHED ON WHAT WHAT STEPS ARE

01:21:33.588 --> 01:21:34.789
BEING TAKEN TO ENSURE EQUITABLE

01:21:34.856 --> 01:21:36.891
DISTRIBUTION OF THE I. R. G.

01:21:36.958 --> 01:21:39.728

LACKEY- SO IN TERMS OF MAKING

01:21:46.468 --> 01:21:47.669
SURE THERE'S A GROUP. OF CRUEL

01:21:47.736 --> 01:21:49.271
DISTRIBUTION OF IRAQI FUNDS

01:21:49.337 --> 01:21:50.805
THROUGHOUT THE STATE- THIS

01:21:50.872 --> 01:21:52.340
REQUEST ACTUALLY INCLUDES

01:21:52.407 --> 01:21:54.109
TRAILER BILL THAT TRIES TO

01:21:54.175 --> 01:21:56.411
MIRROR THE LANGUAGE TO ALLOW A-

01:21:56.478 --> 01:21:58.780
THE POT- SET ASIDE FOR SMALL

01:21:58.847 --> 01:22:00.282
JURISDICTIONS THAT THEY ALSO

01:22:00.348 --> 01:22:00.882
HAVE A CHANCE OF GETTING OF

01:22:00.949 --> 01:22:02.751
WORKS- AGAIN THAT'S PART OF THE

01:22:02.817 --> 01:22:05.253
IDEA. OF AN APPLICATION FUSION

01:22:05.320 --> 01:22:06.488
WILL KEEP ALSO KEEPING IN MIND

01:22:06.554 --> 01:22:08.056
THAT ARE CURRENTLY I BELIEVE IN

01:22:08.123 --> 01:22:10.292
THE REGULATIONS FOR I. G. THEY

01:22:10.358 --> 01:22:12.093
ALSO TAKE IN CONSIDERATION OF

01:22:12.160 --> 01:22:14.396
THE LOCATION. AND THE NEEDS OF

01:22:14.462 --> 01:22:20.201
THE- THE- OUT. OF PROJECTS IN

01:22:20.268 --> 01:22:21.903
APPLICANTS. I WOULD JUST ADD TO

01:22:21.970 --> 01:22:25.740

01:22:25.807 --> 01:22:27.776
PROVIDES TARGETING FOR VARIOUS

01:22:27.842 --> 01:22:30.045
GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS- SO WHILE

THERE IS KIND OF A SET ASIDE

01:22:31.946 --> 01:22:33.448
FOR THE SMALLER. AND

01:22:33.515 --> 01:22:35.016
JURISDICTIONS THERE'S ALSO A

01:22:35.083 --> 01:22:35.750

THE CENTRAL VALLEY. AS WELL TO

01:22:40.121 --> 01:22:40.689

SMALL JURISDICTIONS. SO WE

01:22:56.071 --> 01:22:59.808
ANTICIPATE- TYING IT TO THE

01:22:59.874 --> 01:23:00.809
NUMBER OF JURISDICTIONS KIND OF

01:23:00.875 --> 01:23:02.344

IT'S NOT A GOOD FEELING WHEN

01:31:32.620 --> 01:31:33.621
THE STATE SENDS ENFORCEMENT

01:31:33.688 --> 01:31:36.757

I HOPE IT IS IT DOESN'T COME

01:31:48.536 --> 01:31:51.239
ACROSS AS MISTRUST- BUT I

01:31:51.305 --> 01:31:54.876

01:32:10.424 --> 01:32:12.493
GIVEN HOW MUCH THE BAR HAS BEEN

01:32:12.560 --> 01:32:13.561
RAISED BY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

01:32:13.628 --> 01:32:15.897
OVER TIME. AND FELT THAT THAT

01:32:15.963 --> 01:32:18.065
THE FRAME THAT WE START FROM-

01:32:18.132 --> 01:32:19.800

PERSPECTIVE ON THIS COMMITTEE I

01:34:51.552 --> 01:34:53.654
WAS VERY GLAD TO SEE THE

01:34:53.721 --> 01:34:54.789
ADMINISTRATION MAKE THIS

01:34:54.855 --> 01:34:57.358
PROPOSAL IN THIS AREA- I THINK

01:34:57.425 --> 01:34:59.994
THERE ARE MANY CITIES THAT ARE.

01:35:00.061 --> 01:35:01.896
ABIDING BY OUR HOUSING LAWS IN

01:35:01.962 --> 01:35:04.231
THIS AREA BUT THEY- IT'S NOT AN

01:35:04.298 --> 01:35:06.200
ACCIDENT THAT CALIFORNIA IS

01:35:06.267 --> 01:35:07.268
THREE AND A HALF MILLION UNITS

01:35:07.334 --> 01:35:08.702
BEHIND WHEN IT COMES TO HOUSING

01:35:08.769 --> 01:35:10.805
PRODUCTION AND THERE ARE MANY

01:35:10.871 --> 01:35:12.473
DOCUMENTED INSTANCES OF

01:35:12.540 --> 01:35:14.842
VIOLATIONS BY DIFFERENT CITIES.

01:35:14.909 --> 01:35:16.310

01:35:19.747 --> 01:35:20.381
BONUS LAW WITH ANTI

01:35:20.448 --> 01:35:23.851
DISCRIMINATION LAW AND- AND I

01:35:23.918 --> 01:35:25.986
FOR ONE OF VERY MUCH SUPPORT-

01:35:26.053 --> 01:35:27.288
THIS SUPPORT AND I THINK WE

01:35:27.354 --> 01:35:28.923
NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE LAWS

01:35:28.989 --> 01:35:30.424
ARE FOLLOWED BY ALL CITIES AND

01:35:30.491 --> 01:35:32.326
IT SHOULD JUST BE SOME CITIES-

01:35:32.393 --> 01:35:33.828
THE ONE QUESTION I HAVE FOR

01:35:33.894 --> 01:35:36.864
FOLLOW UP FOR. THE

01:35:36.931 --> 01:35:38.299
ADMINISTRATION IS- IT'S ONE

01:35:38.365 --> 01:35:40.167
THING TO FOLLOW- HOUSING LAWS

01:35:40.234 --> 01:35:42.536
AROUND PRODUCTION BUT AS WE

01:35:42.603 --> 01:35:43.604
WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT WITH AN

01:35:43.671 --> 01:35:45.372
EARLIER ITEM SO MANY CITIES ARE

01:35:45.439 --> 01:35:46.640
REALLY STRUGGLING WHEN IT COMES

01:35:46.707 --> 01:35:49.343
TO HOMELESSNESS AND ADDRESSING-

01:35:49.410 --> 01:35:50.377
WHETHER WE'RE BUILDING THE

01:35:50.444 --> 01:35:52.079
NAVIGATION CENTERS AND SHELTERS

01:35:52.146 --> 01:35:52.780
INTO PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE

01:35:52.847 --> 01:35:55.015
HOUSING. AND I DID HAVE A

01:35:55.082 --> 01:35:57.451
CHANCE TO TAKE A QUICK LOOK AT

01:35:57.518 --> 01:35:58.886
THIS BUT I DON'T REALLY HAVE A

01:35:58.953 --> 01:36:01.222
SENSE THAT THERE IS MUCH. THAT

01:36:01.288 --> 01:36:02.690
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL RATE CD

01:36:02.756 --> 01:36:04.191
CAN LOOK AT WHEN IT COMES TO

01:36:04.258 --> 01:36:07.027
REQUIRING JURISDICTIONS TO

01:36:07.094 --> 01:36:08.963
SPECIFICALLY ADDRESS THE TYPES

01:36:09.029 --> 01:36:11.232
OF SHELTERS THAT ARE NECESSARY

01:36:11.298 --> 01:36:12.266
FOR OUR HOMELESS POPULATIONS

01:36:12.333 --> 01:36:14.135
COULD YOU. SHED A LITTLE I KNOW

01:36:14.201 --> 01:36:16.203
AND I WOULD I'D LOVE TO RESPOND

01:36:16.270 --> 01:36:19.306
TO THAT. YEAH AND THE QUIET

01:36:19.373 --> 01:36:21.542
PART. AND THAT'S GOOD QUESTION.

01:36:21.609 --> 01:36:25.646
YEAH THAT- THAT THAT BAY AREAS

01:36:25.713 --> 01:36:28.082
OF ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY THAT

01:36:28.149 --> 01:36:28.649
EIGHTY SEVENTY TO PROVIDE A

01:36:28.716 --> 01:36:30.885
TASTY BE INCLUDED ALL HOUSING

01:36:30.951 --> 01:36:33.454
ELEMENT LAW- BUT ALSO HAVING

01:36:33.521 --> 01:36:35.256
HAD ABILITY ACT AND LAND USE

01:36:35.322 --> 01:36:37.892
DISCRIMINATION. I THINK AND I

01:36:37.958 --> 01:36:39.160
MENTIONED IT ONCE BEFORE I

01:36:39.226 --> 01:36:41.262
THINK A LOT OF CASES INVOLVED.

01:36:41.328 --> 01:36:43.364
AS LOOKING AT THAT- THE WHOLE

01:36:43.430 --> 01:36:45.533
SET OF HOUSING LAWS. AND BUT I

01:36:45.599 --> 01:36:47.401
THINK HOMELESSNESS OFTEN FALLS

01:36:47.468 --> 01:36:48.369
INTO ONE OF THOSE THREE

01:36:48.435 --> 01:36:50.471
CATEGORIES- SO UNDER HOUSING

01:36:50.538 --> 01:36:51.572
ELEMENT LAW THERE ARE A LOT OF

01:36:51.639 --> 01:36:53.174
OBLIGATION JURISDICTION HAVE TO

01:36:53.240 --> 01:36:54.708
BE DOING IN TERMS THAT. ARE

01:36:54.775 --> 01:36:56.644
MAKING IT EASIER TO BUILD

01:36:56.710 --> 01:37:00.114
HOUSING PARTICULARLY AND FOR

01:37:00.181 --> 01:37:02.183
HOME WITHIN THAT THAT CAN AND

01:37:02.249 --> 01:37:03.484
HELP ALLEVIATE OUR HOMELESSNESS

01:37:03.551 --> 01:37:06.820
CRISIS- AND IN PROVIDING-

01:37:06.887 --> 01:37:09.924
EMERGENCY SHELTER- BY RIGHT AND

01:37:09.990 --> 01:37:12.493
OTHER OTHER THINGS INTEL. AND

01:37:12.560 --> 01:37:14.328
UNDER HOUSING ELEMENT LAW THAT

01:37:14.395 --> 01:37:16.497
WE HAVE THAT A LOT AT A LOT

01:37:16.564 --> 01:37:18.899
AND- PURVIEW THERE. AND AS WELL

01:37:18.966 --> 01:37:20.768
AS UNDER HOUSING CAN ABILITY

01:37:20.834 --> 01:37:22.603
ACT AND EVERYTHING THAT THE BIG

01:37:22.670 --> 01:37:23.938
PLACE WHERE WE SEE A LOT OF THE

01:37:24.004 --> 01:37:27.041
AMOUNT IS AND THE DESIRE TO- TO

01:37:27.107 --> 01:37:28.442
PAY NOW AND JUST A REMINDER

01:37:28.509 --> 01:37:29.677
THAT WE HAVE AN ACCOUNTABILITY

01:37:29.743 --> 01:37:30.711
ACT AS PROVIDE A LOT OF

01:37:30.778 --> 01:37:33.147
PROTECTION. AND IF HOUSING IS

01:37:33.214 --> 01:37:34.615
GOING TO BE AFFORDABLE AND

01:37:34.682 --> 01:37:37.351
AVAILABLE TO. AND ADD TO LOWER

01:37:37.418 --> 01:37:44.391
INCOME HOUSEHOLDS AND- HELP

01:37:44.458 --> 01:37:45.159
ALLEVIATE SOME OF THAT. WELL I

01:37:45.226 --> 01:37:45.726
I'M I'M REALLY GLAD TO HEAR

01:37:45.793 --> 01:37:46.527
THAT IN AGAIN IS WHY IT'S A PO

01:37:46.594 --> 01:37:47.194
FOR THEIR TO BE. AND FOR OF THE

01:37:47.261 --> 01:37:48.329

01:37:48.395 --> 01:37:49.430
LAWS O JUST BE ON THE BOOKS

01:37:49.496 --> 01:37:52.533
BUT- IF CITIES I MEAN WE KNOW.

01:37:52.600 --> 01:37:54.702
ARE ALL I THINK MANY OF US HAVE

01:37:54.768 --> 01:37:57.171
BEEN LOCAL OFFICIALS AND IT'S

01:37:57.238 --> 01:37:59.173
OFTEN WHEN YOUR CONSTITUENTS

01:37:59.240 --> 01:38:01.342
ARE SAYING NO TO A PROJECT-

01:38:01.408 --> 01:38:02.910
IT'S EASIER LOCAL OFFICIAL TO

01:38:02.977 --> 01:38:05.212
TURN A BLIND EYE. AND I THINK

01:38:05.279 --> 01:38:06.647
IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE STATE TO

01:38:06.714 --> 01:38:07.848
JUST REMIND EVERYONE OF THE

01:38:07.915 --> 01:38:09.049

FOLLOW- THESE HOUSING ELEMENT

01:38:10.851 --> 01:38:11.685
LAWS AND THEN THE OTHER THING

01:38:11.752 --> 01:38:13.153
I'LL SAY IS. TYPICALLY THE WAY

01:38:13.220 --> 01:38:14.588
THAT- SAY THE HOUSING ELEMENT

01:38:14.655 --> 01:38:15.589
THAT THE HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY

01:38:15.656 --> 01:38:17.725
ACT IS ENFORCED AS BY SOMEONE

01:38:17.791 --> 01:38:18.959
WHO WANTS TO BUILD THIS

01:38:19.026 --> 01:38:20.961

02:20:53.011 --> 02:20:55.013
NORMAL. IN IN IN IN MY SEVEN

02:20:55.079 --> 02:20:56.247
YEARS HERE NO ONE'S EVER TALKED

02:20:56.314 --> 02:20:57.415
ABOUT THAT. WE'RE STILL

02:20:57.482 --> 02:20:59.350
THROWING MONEY AT THIS PROBLEM

02:20:59.417 --> 02:21:00.485
AND THAT DOESN'T HELP BECAUSE

02:21:00.552 --> 02:21:01.653
SOME THAT THAT THAT SEVERELY

02:21:01.719 --> 02:21:03.421
MENTALLY ILL THEY CAN'T MAKE

02:21:03.488 --> 02:21:05.456
THAT DECISION. YOU CAN HAVE

02:21:05.523 --> 02:21:07.425
YOUR- NOT YOU THAT REACH

02:21:07.492 --> 02:21:08.993
WORKERS TALK TO MORE YOU WANT.

02:21:09.060 --> 02:21:10.461
BUT EVEN TODAY IF THEY CAN'T

02:21:10.528 --> 02:21:12.197
MAKE DECISION FOR HIMSELF.

02:21:12.263 --> 02:21:13.798
THEMSELVES AT WHAT TIME DOES

02:21:13.865 --> 02:21:15.900
THE STATE STEP IN. AND BE THE

02:21:15.967 --> 02:21:16.968
ADULTS THE ROOM TO MAKE THAT

02:21:17.035 --> 02:21:18.536
DECISION I'VE NEVER HEARD FROM

02:21:18.603 --> 02:21:19.704
ANYONE FROM ANYONE IS

02:21:19.771 --> 02:21:20.872
ORGANIZATIONS HERE TODAY SAYING

02:21:20.939 --> 02:21:22.707
THAT. IT IS HIGH TIME WITH A

02:21:22.774 --> 02:21:24.676
CONVERSATION WITH THAT. BECAUSE

02:21:24.742 --> 02:21:27.178
OTHERWISE IT'S NOT GONNA CHANGE

02:21:27.245 --> 02:21:27.712
WHEN PEOPLE COMPLAIN ABOUT

02:21:27.779 --> 02:21:28.813
HOMELESSNESS. YOU KNOW THERE'S

02:21:28.880 --> 02:21:30.114
A LOT OF HOMELESSNESS HOMELESS

02:21:30.181 --> 02:21:32.984

02:21:33.051 --> 02:21:34.919
FOLKS THAT ARE CHRONICALLY.

02:21:34.986 --> 02:21:37.121

02:21:37.755 --> 02:21:41.192
PROBLEMS. SO HOW DO WE

02:21:41.259 --> 02:21:44.062
RECONCILE THAT ONCE AND FOR ALL.

02:21:44.128 --> 02:21:46.698
WHAT I WOULD SAY THE NUMBER

02:21:46.764 --> 02:21:47.265
THIRTEEN THOUSAND THAT HAVE

02:21:47.332 --> 02:21:48.900

WORKING FOR GATHERING FROM THE

02:22:01.479 --> 02:22:03.481
PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM I WOULD

02:22:03.548 --> 02:22:04.849

FIGHTING UPSTREAM IS LAW IN THE

02:22:31.576 --> 02:22:32.043
SIXTEEN THOUSAND THAT WERE

THERE ARE THERE ARE

02:23:19.090 --> 02:23:20.358
UNFORTUNATELY OUR NUMBER OF

02:23:20.425 --> 02:23:21.726
FOLKS THAT WILL FALL BACK INTO

02:23:21.793 --> 02:23:23.294

PERMANENT. I WOULD BE ABLE TO

02:23:38.543 --> 02:23:39.811
TRACK IT BACK BUT IT IS DATA

02:23:39.877 --> 02:23:40.611
THAT WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO

02:23:40.678 --> 02:23:42.747

WE SEE THAT DATA THAN. THE ONLY

02:24:00.298 --> 02:24:01.366
THING THAT GRAYSON SYSTEM GO

WILL BE AND I THINK THAT'S

02:24:11.142 --> 02:24:11.876
IMPORTANT TO US KNOW HOW MANY

02:24:11.943 --> 02:24:14.212

THEY DON'T WANT TO COME IN. ARE

02:24:22.086 --> 02:24:25.723
NOT ABLE TO MAKE THAT DECISION.

02:24:25.790 --> 02:24:26.324
IT'S A MOOT POINT. BECAUSE WE

02:24:26.391 --> 02:24:27.558

02:24:27.625 --> 02:24:31.929

MANY MANY YEARS. AND RIGHT NOW

02:26:58.242 --> 02:27:00.211
THAT THAT SEEMS TO BE THE

02:27:00.278 --> 02:27:00.945
AVENUE OF PROTECTION THAT MANY

02:27:13.324 --> 02:27:15.993
SENSE OF FRUSTRATION. THAT THE

MOVE FORWARD SO- A COUPLE

02:31:47.364 --> 02:31:49.366
QUESTIONS I HAVE- I ONE THING

02:31:49.433 --> 02:31:50.501
THAT REALLY JUMPED OUT IN THE

02:31:50.568 --> 02:31:52.403
COMMITTEE ANALYSIS WAS THAT HE

02:31:52.470 --> 02:31:53.938
HAS SERVED IF I DID THE MATH

02:31:54.004 --> 02:31:57.208
CORRECTLY- FOURTEEN TIMES THE

02:31:57.274 --> 02:32:02.680
NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE.

02:32:02.746 --> 02:32:03.247
PASSED AND I ASSUME THAT HAS

02:32:03.314 --> 02:32:04.315
SOME AND TO DO WITH THE-

02:32:04.381 --> 02:32:05.549
PROGRAM. OF THE FACT THAT IT'S

02:32:05.616 --> 02:32:08.018
NEWER- COULD YOU TALK ABOUT WHY

02:32:08.085 --> 02:32:09.487
THE DISCREPANCY IS SO

02:32:09.553 --> 02:32:11.088
SIGNIFICANT SO HE PRESERVED

02:32:11.155 --> 02:32:12.990
OVER. SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND FOLKS

02:32:13.057 --> 02:32:14.625

02:32:18.295 --> 02:32:19.930
KNOW CAP WAS SUPPOSED TO FOCUS

02:32:19.997 --> 02:32:21.832
ON REGIONAL COORDINATION. COULD

02:32:21.899 --> 02:32:23.000
YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

02:32:23.067 --> 02:32:25.035
WHAT YOU'RE SEEING IN THAT WORK

02:32:25.102 --> 02:32:26.670
ONE OF THE BEST PRACTICES. TO

02:32:26.737 --> 02:32:28.005
FACILITATE THAT REGIONAL

02:32:28.072 --> 02:32:30.841
COORDINATION WORK WHICH WE KNOW

02:32:30.908 --> 02:32:31.475
IS SO IMPORTANT TO GRAPPLE WITH

02:32:31.542 --> 02:32:34.278
THIS. YEAH ABSOLUTELY I THINK

02:32:34.345 --> 02:32:35.746
THE DIFFERENCE YOU'RE SEEING

02:32:35.813 --> 02:32:37.882
AND HE COULDN'T HAPPEN FIRST

02:32:37.948 --> 02:32:40.351
TERM IN IN ALMOST ENTIRELY YOU

02:32:40.417 --> 02:32:41.986
TO WHEN THEY- WERE RELEASED

02:32:42.052 --> 02:32:44.088

IN HAPPENED ABOUT FIVE MONTHS

02:32:52.429 --> 02:32:54.198

OVERSEEING AND KEEP IT OVER TWO

02:32:56.534 --> 02:32:57.801
YEARS. EIGHT SO THERE'S A

02:32:57.868 --> 02:32:59.703
PRETTY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE

02:32:59.770 --> 02:33:02.006
IN TIME AT THAT I MEAN. AND SO

02:33:02.072 --> 02:33:03.007

02:34:28.325 --> 02:34:29.727
KNOW A COUPLE A FAMILY THING

02:34:29.793 --> 02:34:30.728
THAT THE NUMBER OF COMMUNITIES

02:34:30.794 --> 02:34:32.963
ACTUALLY WERE CITIES ARE OUR

02:34:33.030 --> 02:34:36.533
MOST I'M- TRYING TO ACTUALLY BE

02:34:36.600 --> 02:34:38.302
THE ONES TO PURCHASE-

02:34:38.369 --> 02:34:40.604
ADDITIONAL. ADDED TO NAVIGATION

02:34:40.671 --> 02:34:42.272
CENTERS ARE EMERGENCY SHELTER

02:34:42.339 --> 02:34:44.408
AFFECTS YOUR FEET ARE MORE

02:34:44.475 --> 02:34:46.377
FACTS TENTATIVELY DO THAT THE

02:34:46.443 --> 02:34:48.312
OPERATIONS OF THE FINDINGS ARE

02:34:48.379 --> 02:34:52.116
USING- I THINK HE HE- HE FUNDS

02:34:52.182 --> 02:34:53.017
TO PURCHASE THE PROPERTY BACK

02:34:53.083 --> 02:34:54.485
AND HAVING TO SEE I SEE YOU

02:34:54.551 --> 02:34:55.686
THERE. I'M ACTUALLY KEEPING

02:34:55.753 --> 02:34:57.121
ONGOING THREE THINK THAT

02:34:57.187 --> 02:34:58.789
HANDFUL OF THAT KIND OF WORK.

02:34:58.856 --> 02:35:00.090
AND BUT I THINK WE'RE REALLY

02:35:00.157 --> 02:35:01.792
HEARTENED BY AND WOULD STAY IN

02:35:01.859 --> 02:35:04.328
THE PAST PRACTICE. IN ADDITION

02:35:04.395 --> 02:35:05.162
THE DIFFERENT FUNDING ENTITIES

02:35:05.229 --> 02:35:07.064
THAT WE START I THINK WE'VE

02:35:07.131 --> 02:35:08.265
ALSO SEEN SOME REALLY GREAT

02:35:08.332 --> 02:35:10.267
LOCAL PARTNERSHIPS WITH- SOME

02:35:10.334 --> 02:35:11.702
OF THE USED PROVIDERS THAT THAT

02:35:11.769 --> 02:35:13.070
ARE ARE OUT THERE ARE PUBLIC

02:35:13.137 --> 02:35:15.072
HOUSING AUTHORITIES. AND EVEN

02:35:15.139 --> 02:35:16.473
OUR CALTRANS BUT THERE IS A

02:35:16.540 --> 02:35:17.741
GREAT EXAMPLE IN OAKLAND THAT

02:35:17.808 --> 02:35:19.176
OF A LOCAL LOCAL PARTNERSHIP

02:35:19.243 --> 02:35:20.878
WITH CALTRANS THAT APARTMENT

02:35:20.944 --> 02:35:23.580
NUMBER OF UNSHELTERED FOLKS IN

02:35:23.647 --> 02:35:25.916
INTO THAT- BY A LOCAL SHELTER

02:35:25.983 --> 02:35:27.184
THERE SO. REALLY GOOD

02:35:27.251 --> 02:35:28.419
OPPORTUNITIES I THINK HAPPENING

02:35:28.485 --> 02:35:31.055
THIS FUNDING SELF. OF THE LINE

02:35:31.121 --> 02:35:44.168
COULD BE. THE GREAT. PROJECT

02:35:44.234 --> 02:35:47.004
THAT. I HAD ONE SO OF QUESTIONS

02:35:47.071 --> 02:35:48.338
DATA. AND AS YOU KNOW IT'S WE

02:35:48.405 --> 02:35:48.906
DISCUSS A YEARS AGO I HAD A

02:35:48.972 --> 02:35:49.640
BILL. THAT WOULD CREATE THE

02:35:49.707 --> 02:35:51.308
DATA WHERE AND I TO SEND AN I'M

02:35:51.375 --> 02:35:52.509
AS X. AS I THINK YOU ARE. A HOW

02:35:52.576 --> 02:35:53.310
CLOSE YOUR TO LAUNCH IN THIS

02:35:53.377 --> 02:35:54.411
DAY. WAREHOUSE BECAUSE WE KNOW

02:35:54.478 --> 02:35:54.945
THE MORE FROM WE HAVE THE

02:35:55.012 --> 02:35:56.280
BETTER WE CAN WE CAN ACHIEVE-

02:35:56.346 --> 02:35:56.880
SORT OF TWO FOR QUESTION TO

02:35:56.947 --> 02:35:57.881
WHAT OU'RE DOING WITH THAT

02:35:57.948 --> 02:36:00.718
DATA. ONE IS- YOU KNOW THE IDEA

02:36:00.784 --> 02:36:02.753
FOR THIS IS FOR STATE AGENCIES

02:36:02.820 --> 02:36:04.088
TO TAKE THIS LOCAL DATA AND

02:36:04.154 --> 02:36:06.190
THEN USE IT TO BETTER TARGET.

02:36:06.256 --> 02:36:08.025
SOCIAL SAFETY NET PROGRAMS AT

02:36:08.092 --> 02:36:10.360
THE STATE LEVEL WONDERING IF

02:36:10.427 --> 02:36:11.829
THAT NEXT STEP IS GOING TO

02:36:11.895 --> 02:36:12.830
HAPPEN SORT OF WHAT WHAT

02:36:12.896 --> 02:36:14.131
HAPPENS WHEN YOU HAVE THE STATE

02:36:14.198 --> 02:36:14.631
WHEN IT COMES TO STATE

02:36:14.698 --> 02:36:16.533
PROGRAMS. THE OTHER QUESTION I

02:36:16.600 --> 02:36:18.368
HAVE IS- THERE'S BEEN AN

02:36:18.435 --> 02:36:20.270
ONGOING CONVERSATION ABOUT. THE

02:36:20.337 --> 02:36:22.039
NEED FOR A GAPS AND NEEDS

02:36:22.106 --> 02:36:23.874
ANALYSIS AND BY THAT I MEAN.

02:36:23.941 --> 02:36:25.709
IT'S ONE THING TO KNOW WHAT

02:36:25.776 --> 02:36:27.177
LOCALS ARE DOING CURRENTLY ON

02:36:27.244 --> 02:36:29.346
HOMELESSNESS AND HOPEFULLY ALSO

02:36:29.413 --> 02:36:31.615
KNOW WHAT THE NEED IS. AND WE

02:36:31.682 --> 02:36:32.683
NEED TO DO THE ANALYSIS OF THE

02:36:32.750 --> 02:36:34.017
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT WE'RE

02:36:34.084 --> 02:36:35.786
DOING AND WHAT WE NEED. TO BE

02:36:35.853 --> 02:36:37.788
ABLE TO TALLY UP HOW MUCH MORE

02:36:37.855 --> 02:36:38.922
THE STATE NEEDS TO INVEST IN

02:36:38.989 --> 02:36:41.024
THIS AREA. AND IT'S NOT CLEAR

02:36:41.091 --> 02:36:42.860
TO ME AT ALL THAT THAT THAT THE

02:36:42.926 --> 02:36:43.861
STATEWIDE DATA WAREHOUSE WILL

02:36:43.927 --> 02:36:44.895
BE ABLE TO GET US THAT

02:36:44.962 --> 02:36:46.997
INFORMATION SO WONDERING. ON

02:36:47.064 --> 02:36:48.432
THOSE TWO QUESTIONS SORT OF ONE

02:36:48.499 --> 02:36:50.067
THE IMPACT ON THE INFORMATION

02:36:50.134 --> 02:36:51.902
ON STATE PROGRAMS AND TO. HOW

02:36:51.969 --> 02:36:53.270
CAN WE REALLY GET AT THAT

02:36:53.337 --> 02:36:55.005
NUMBER IF I'M IF I'M LOOKING

02:36:55.072 --> 02:36:56.840
FOR THE NUMBER OF HOW MUCH THE

02:36:56.907 --> 02:36:57.941
STATE NEEDS TO INVEST IN

02:36:58.008 --> 02:36:59.543
HOMELESSNESS. IN THE COMING

02:36:59.610 --> 02:37:01.578
YEARS TO END HOMELESSNESS. IS

02:37:01.645 --> 02:37:04.782
THIS DATA GOING TO GET US THAT

02:37:04.848 --> 02:37:05.749
INFORMATION. YEAH GREAT GREAT

02:37:05.816 --> 02:37:08.218
QUESTION SO I CAN WHAT WILL.

02:37:08.285 --> 02:37:08.986
THAT IS THAT IS ONE AT THE END

02:37:09.052 --> 02:37:10.020
OF THE MONTH IT'S JUST WHAT

02:37:10.087 --> 02:37:11.121
WE'RE GOING. SORT OF THE

02:37:11.188 --> 02:37:12.556
BEGINNING OF WHAT EACH DAY I

02:37:12.623 --> 02:37:15.292
CAN ACTUALLY PROVIDE- WE REALLY

02:37:15.359 --> 02:37:16.927
SEE IT AS- AN OPPORTUNITY. TO

02:37:16.994 --> 02:37:18.595
THINK ABOUT HOW WE INFORM OUR

02:37:18.662 --> 02:37:20.531
POLICY MAKING AND RESOURCES TO

02:37:20.597 --> 02:37:21.999
TERMINATION I'M GOING REALLY

02:37:22.065 --> 02:37:24.301
INTO THE FUTURE. SO THAT ONE

02:37:24.368 --> 02:37:25.169
WILL BE SORT OF SHOWING THE

02:37:25.235 --> 02:37:27.037
FIRST AND WE'RE CALLING A BETA

WILL HAVE A HANDFUL OF

02:37:30.040 --> 02:37:32.309
DASHBOARDS REALLY DIVING INTO

02:37:32.376 --> 02:37:33.243
THE CHARACTERISTICS OF PEOPLE

02:37:33.310 --> 02:37:34.878
EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS.

02:37:34.945 --> 02:37:36.146
THINKING ABOUT THAT CROFTERS

02:37:36.213 --> 02:37:38.148
FICTIONAL OVERLAP- IN BEING

02:37:38.215 --> 02:37:39.483
BETWEEN DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES

02:37:39.550 --> 02:37:41.585
THAT STATE. SEEM AS A SIMPLE

02:37:41.652 --> 02:37:42.953
OUT THERE GOING TO BE A LOT

02:37:43.020 --> 02:37:44.588
THEY ARE JUST THE FIRST ONE BUT

THERE'S A LOT MORE THAN WE NOW

02:37:46.089 --> 02:37:47.691
WE CAN ANALYZE AND LOOKING TO.

02:37:47.758 --> 02:37:50.060
ANSWER QUESTIONS GROUND SO.

02:37:50.127 --> 02:37:51.361
WE'RE EXPECTING SORT OF ON

QUESTIONS. ANSWERED RESEARCH

02:37:57.134 --> 02:37:58.468
STANDPOINT JUST BECAUSE OF HOW

02:37:58.535 --> 02:38:00.270
HARD PASSED THE SYSTEM WILL BE-

02:38:00.337 --> 02:38:01.772

BILLIONS OF DOLLARS WE HAVE

02:39:46.777 --> 02:39:48.111
ALREADY SPENT BUT FROM MY

02:39:48.178 --> 02:39:49.713
PERSPECTIVE. PART OF THE

02:39:49.780 --> 02:39:50.981
FRUSTRATION IS NOT JUST ABOUT

02:39:51.048 --> 02:39:52.883
HOW THOSE DOLLARS ARE SPENT BUT

02:39:52.950 --> 02:39:55.619
IS THE REALITY THAT WE ARE JUST

02:39:55.686 --> 02:39:57.387

IT'S A MATTER SCALE AND- I

02:40:11.802 --> 02:40:13.170
THINK WE HAVE TO DO A

02:40:13.236 --> 02:40:15.405
COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS OF.

02:40:15.472 --> 02:40:16.406
REALLY WHAT'S IT GONNA TAKE IF

02:40:16.473 --> 02:40:18.175

02:48:43.680 --> 02:48:46.983
WAS ABOUT 46% THE INLAND REGION

02:48:48.084 --> 02:48:49.552

PROJECTS THAT WILL BE FUNDED

THAT- FOCUSES ON COST

02:51:15.798 --> 02:51:18.034
EFFICIENCY AND DOESN'T REFLECT

02:51:18.101 --> 02:51:19.502
THE FACT THAT IN HIGH COST

WHERE THEY ARE NEAR JOBS AND

02:51:31.481 --> 02:51:34.651
TRANSIT HUBS- WE THINK THAT-

02:51:34.717 --> 02:51:36.152
THERE ARE PROJECTS ARE BEING

02:51:36.219 --> 02:51:37.754

CONTAINMENT WAS A HUGE THING-

02:52:03.312 --> 02:52:04.714
AND ANOTHER THING WAS.

02:52:04.781 --> 02:52:06.516
SPREADING THE RESOURCES AND

02:52:06.582 --> 02:52:07.283
WHEN YOU MENTION THE TIE

BREAKER. WHAT TYPE RECOGNITION

02:52:10.053 --> 02:52:13.122

02:52:16.159 --> 02:52:18.494
HIGHER VANTAGE. IN ADDITION

02:52:18.561 --> 02:52:19.796
UNIT PRODUCTION IS ALSO IN

02:52:19.862 --> 02:52:23.833
THERE AND I THINK WE ARE. THE

02:52:23.900 --> 02:52:26.135
POLICY OBVIOUSLY DISCUSSION

02:52:26.202 --> 02:52:26.703
WITH THE REGULATIONS WHAT'S

02:52:26.769 --> 02:52:31.941
WHAT'S TAKING PLACE. AND WE ARE

02:52:32.008 --> 02:52:34.510
LOOKING AT IT AND- OBVIOUSLY WE

02:52:34.577 --> 02:52:36.512
DON'T KNOW THE RESULTS UNTIL

02:52:36.579 --> 02:52:37.613
YOU KNOW THE APPLICATIONS ARE

02:52:37.680 --> 02:52:40.917

02:52:40.983 --> 02:52:44.954
ROUND THAT YOU'RE REFERENCING.

02:52:45.021 --> 02:52:45.588
OBVIOUSLY THE APPLICATIONS WERE

02:52:45.655 --> 02:52:46.189
SUBMITTED. AND THEY'RE STILL

02:52:46.255 --> 02:52:48.091
REVIEW. SO WE WON'T KNOW THE

02:52:48.157 --> 02:52:50.593
FINAL RESULT- UNTIL THEY DO

02:52:50.660 --> 02:52:53.329
WARDS REMAIN. WE ARE AWARE OF

02:52:53.396 --> 02:52:55.364
THAT AND WE ARE LOOKING AT IT-

02:52:55.431 --> 02:52:57.333
WE ARE ALSO REVIEWING THE BASIS

02:52:57.400 --> 02:53:00.470
LIMITS- THAT'S ALSO BEING

02:53:00.536 --> 02:53:03.306
INCLUDED IN THE TIE BREAKER-

02:53:03.372 --> 02:53:05.108
BUT WE ARE OBVIOUSLY WE WANT TO

02:53:05.174 --> 02:53:07.810
BE EQUITABLE TO ALL PARTIES

02:53:07.877 --> 02:53:10.413
AND- WE ALSO HAD WORKING

02:53:10.480 --> 02:53:13.149
GROUP'S WHICH INCLUDED. WORLD

02:53:13.216 --> 02:53:15.918

NONPROFITS AND FOR PROFITS. IN

02:53:18.721 --> 02:53:21.557
THE WORD- PART OF THE PROCESS

02:53:21.624 --> 02:53:22.992
AND WE MAKE SURE THAT THEY WERE

02:53:23.059 --> 02:53:24.227
INCLUDED AS PART OF THE PROCESS

02:53:24.293 --> 02:53:26.362
THAT I DURING THIS WHOLE

02:53:26.429 --> 02:53:29.365
REGULATION CHANGE- YEAH THE

02:53:29.432 --> 02:53:30.867
ENTIRE PROCESS WE WANT TO BE

02:53:30.933 --> 02:53:32.969
TRANSPARENT. AND I THINK WE

02:53:33.035 --> 02:53:34.604
WERE BY TAKING THESE TO PUBLIC

02:53:34.670 --> 02:53:37.874
MEETINGS. AND YOU KNOW

02:53:37.940 --> 02:53:39.976
SOMETIMES THE OUTCOMES- WE HAVE

02:53:40.042 --> 02:53:42.345
TO LOOK AT GO BACK AND LOOK AT.

02:53:42.411 --> 02:53:44.580
RE REVIEW THE REGULATIONS AND-

02:53:44.647 --> 02:53:47.383
SEE IF THEY- PUT OUT WHAT WE-

02:53:47.450 --> 02:53:48.017
THE POLICIES THAT WE

02:53:48.084 --> 02:53:50.153
ENVISIONED. WHEN THEY WERE PUT

02:53:50.219 --> 02:53:53.055
IN PLACE. SO YOU KNOW I THINK

02:53:53.122 --> 02:53:54.857
WHAT ELSE AND RESPONSE I AS YOU

02:53:54.924 --> 02:53:56.893
PROBABLY KNOW I AM. THE ONE

02:53:56.959 --> 02:53:57.960
LEGISLATOR IN THE LEAD THE ONE

02:53:58.027 --> 02:53:59.695
LEGISLATOR THE LEGISLATURE OF

02:53:59.762 --> 02:54:03.266
THE PAST SIX YEARS THAT HAS-REALLY CHAMPIONED- THE

02:54:03.332 --> 02:54:04.600
SIGNIFICANT EXPANSION THAT

02:54:04.667 --> 02:54:06.235
WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO INVEST IN

02:54:06.302 --> 02:54:08.371
THE PORTLAND TAX CREDIT- I

02:54:08.437 --> 02:54:10.139
INTRODUCED. A BILL TO DO THAT

02:54:10.206 --> 02:54:11.908
EVERY YEAR FIRST. BOB IGER

02:54:11.974 --> 02:54:15.144
RESEARCH AND- AND SO I

02:54:15.211 --> 02:54:16.612
APPRECIATE AYE I AM VERY

02:54:16.679 --> 02:54:17.680
SUPPORTIVE OF THE LEVEL THAT

02:54:17.747 --> 02:54:19.415
WE'RE AT- BUT I DON'T THINK ANY

02:54:19.482 --> 02:54:21.551
OF US IN THE BAY ANTICIPATED-

02:54:21.617 --> 02:54:22.952
THAT THIS WOULD MEAN VERY

02:54:23.019 --> 02:54:24.587
LITTLE FUNDING COMING TO OUR

02:54:24.654 --> 02:54:26.289
REGION WHICH HAS BEEN GROUND

02:54:26.355 --> 02:54:28.057
ZERO FOR. THE HOUSING CRISIS

02:54:28.124 --> 02:54:30.293
AND SO- I HEAR WHAT YOU'RE

02:54:30.359 --> 02:54:31.227
SAYING ABOUT THE REGULATORY

02:54:31.294 --> 02:54:32.461
PROCESS I HEARD A LOT OF

02:54:32.528 --> 02:54:34.063
CRITICISMS OF THAT REGULATORY

02:54:34.130 --> 02:54:35.064
PROCESS I JUST WANT TO SHARE

02:54:35.131 --> 02:54:40.436
THAT. AND FROM MY PERSPECTIVE.

02:54:40.503 --> 02:54:41.871
I THINK- I'M I'M HEARING YOU'RE

02:54:41.938 --> 02:54:42.972
WILLING TO HAVE AN ENGAGEMENT

02:54:43.039 --> 02:54:44.740
ON THIS- THERE'S A TREMENDOUS

02:54:44.807 --> 02:54:46.209
FRUSTRATION. AMONG THE

02:54:46.275 --> 02:54:47.443
AFFORDABLE HOUSING COMMUNITY

02:54:47.510 --> 02:54:49.478
AND IN THE BAY AREA AROUND THIS

02:54:49.545 --> 02:54:51.914
AND- I HOPE TO NOT HAVE TO

02:54:51.981 --> 02:54:53.249
INTRODUCE BILL TO MOVE THIS

02:54:53.316 --> 02:54:55.117
CONVERSATION. IN A MORE SERIOUS

02:54:55.184 --> 02:54:56.452
HUESO I'D REALLY HOPE IN THE

02:54:56.519 --> 02:54:58.221
NEXT COUPLE OF MONTHS- WE CAN

02:54:58.287 --> 02:54:59.388
GET TO A BETTER SPOT ON THIS

02:54:59.455 --> 02:55:01.290
BECAUSE I THINK AT THIS POINT-

02:55:01.357 --> 02:55:02.491
THE BAY AREA WE FEEL LIKE

02:55:02.558 --> 02:55:04.760
WE'RE- WE'RE PENALIZED- FOR THE

02:55:04.827 --> 02:55:06.729
FACT THAT. WE ARE SUCH A HIGH

02:55:06.796 --> 02:55:08.064
COST REASON AND BECAUSE WE'RE

02:55:08.130 --> 02:55:09.432
HIGH COST REGION WE'RE TRYING

02:55:09.498 --> 02:55:10.066
TO INVEST IN AFFORDABLE

02:55:10.132 --> 02:55:11.500
HOUSING. BUT WE'RE NOT GETTING

02:55:11.567 --> 02:55:13.236
OUR FAIR SHARE OF RESOURCES

02:55:13.302 --> 02:55:14.070
FROM THE STATE ON THAT SO I

02:55:14.136 --> 02:55:16.172
JUST WANT TO STATE THAT-

02:55:16.239 --> 02:55:19.141
SHIFTING TO A SECOND TOPIC- AND

02:55:19.208 --> 02:55:20.810
THIS. GETS TO SOME OF THE

02:55:20.877 --> 02:55:22.511
ISSUES THAT ARE COLLEAGUES OUR

02:55:22.578 --> 02:55:23.479
DISCUSSION FOR AROUND MENTAL

02:55:23.546 --> 02:55:25.047
HEALTH ISSUES. WE KNOW THAT

02:55:25.114 --> 02:55:27.617
HOUSING PROJECTS. THAT REQUIRE

02:55:27.683 --> 02:55:29.285
SUPPORT SERVICES FOR FOLKS WHO

02:55:29.352 --> 02:55:30.853
ARE ADDRESSING MENTAL HEALTH.

02:55:30.920 --> 02:55:32.688
ILLNESSES ARE MORE EXPENSIVE TO

02:55:32.755 --> 02:55:34.790
BUILD AND STAFF. AND MY

02:55:34.857 --> 02:55:36.058
UNDERSTANDING IS THE KINDS OF

02:55:36.125 --> 02:55:37.827
PROJECTS YOU'RE AWARDING DON'T

02:55:37.894 --> 02:55:39.729
REALLY ALIGN WITH THE MORE

02:55:39.795 --> 02:55:42.832
EXPENSIVE- PROJECTS THAT THAT

02:55:42.899 --> 02:55:45.568
REQUIRE- THAT THE TYPES OF. OF

02:55:45.635 --> 02:55:48.204
CARE AND SERVICES FOR- THESE

02:55:48.271 --> 02:55:49.038
CHRONICALLY CHALLENGED

02:55:49.105 --> 02:55:52.108
INDIVIDUALS AGAIN BECAUSE OF

02:55:52.174 --> 02:55:53.042
THE COST FACTOR THAT YOU'RE

02:55:53.109 --> 02:55:54.777
GOING AFTER I. WOULD LIKE YOU

02:55:54.844 --> 02:55:55.444
TO COMMENT ON THAT YOUR

02:55:55.511 --> 02:55:59.181
PERSPECTIVE ON THAT- SOMETHING

02:55:59.248 --> 02:55:59.749
I THINK WE ALSO MAY HAVE TO

02:55:59.815 --> 02:56:02.585
CONSIDER- WELL I WOULD. THE YOU

02:56:02.652 --> 02:56:04.520
KNOW WE DO WHO ARE A PART OF

02:56:04.587 --> 02:56:06.422
THE REGULATION. THAT ONE OF THE

02:56:06.489 --> 02:56:07.957
REGULATIONS THAT WAS ADOPTED

02:56:08.024 --> 02:56:10.192
WAS ESTABLISHING. RULES AND SET

02:56:10.259 --> 02:56:12.128
ASIDES AND- OF THOSE POLLS THAT

02:56:12.194 --> 02:56:14.497
INCLUDED. HOMELESS PROJECTS

02:56:14.563 --> 02:56:16.365
AND- HE ALIVE BE ALIVE

02:56:16.432 --> 02:56:18.901
PROJECTS. I THINK PROJECTS THAT

02:56:18.968 --> 02:56:20.770
FIT. SOME OF THE DESCRIPTION

02:56:20.836 --> 02:56:24.240
YOU HAD STATED. IN I THINK. AND

02:56:24.307 --> 02:56:25.441
I DON'T HAVE THE PROJECTS BUT

02:56:25.508 --> 02:56:26.943
BEFORE ME RIGHT NOW BUT-

02:56:27.009 --> 02:56:28.377
OBVIOUSLY I THINK THE GOAL OF

02:56:28.444 --> 02:56:29.979
THOSE. SET ASIDES WERE TO

02:56:30.046 --> 02:56:32.214
TACKLE THOSE TYPE OF PROJECTS-

02:56:32.281 --> 02:56:35.384
LOWER LOWER INCOME. AND

02:56:35.451 --> 02:56:38.454
HOMELESS POPULATIONS WHICH- AND

02:56:38.521 --> 02:56:40.156
ARE YOU STATING THAT YOU KNOW

02:56:40.222 --> 02:56:45.361
BASED ON. YOUR. ARE YOU STAYING

02:56:45.428 --> 02:56:45.995
SPECIFICALLY THE BAY AREA. WELL

02:56:46.062 --> 02:56:47.163
I CAN. TO THIS IS A BROAD

02:56:47.229 --> 02:56:48.631
STATEWIDE CONVERSATION EVEN

02:56:48.698 --> 02:56:50.132
WITHIN THOSE PROJECTS IF YOU'RE

02:56:50.199 --> 02:56:51.968
TALKING ABOUT DEAL I PROJECTS.

02:56:52.034 --> 02:56:54.503
OR OR OR AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR

02:56:54.570 --> 02:56:56.639
LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS. THERE'S

02:56:56.706 --> 02:56:58.074
A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HOUSING

02:56:58.140 --> 02:56:59.275
THAT ADDRESS FOLKS WITH CHRONIC

02:56:59.342 --> 02:57:01.177
HOMELESS UP CHRONIC MENTAL

02:57:01.243 --> 02:57:02.912
HEALTH ISSUES. THAT HOUSING IS

02:57:02.979 --> 02:57:04.413
MORE EXPENSIVE UNDER YOUR

02:57:04.480 --> 02:57:06.549
CURRENT REGULATORY FORMULAS YOU

02:57:06.615 --> 02:57:08.818
PRIORITIZE THE PER UNIT COST SO

02:57:08.884 --> 02:57:12.855
IT DOESN'T FACTOR IN A KNIFE TO

02:57:12.922 --> 02:57:14.290
ALLOW FOR THOSE PROJECTS TO

02:57:14.357 --> 02:57:16.192
WIN- TOOK TO WIN IN YOUR

02:57:16.258 --> 02:57:18.060
PROCESS SO AGAIN RAISING THE

02:57:18.127 --> 02:57:20.129
IMPACT OF THE COST EFFICIENCY I

02:57:20.196 --> 02:57:21.897
GET. WE ALL WANT TO SEE COST

02:57:21.964 --> 02:57:23.299
EFFICIENCIES BUT THERE ARE

02:57:23.366 --> 02:57:25.101
TIMES WHEN THERE ARE POLICY

02:57:25.167 --> 02:57:27.036
REASONS WHY THE PER UNIT COST

02:57:27.103 --> 02:57:27.937
IF WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS THE

02:57:28.004 --> 02:57:30.006
HOUSING NEEDS OF A- OF A PERSON

02:57:30.072 --> 02:57:31.807
WITH SEVERE MENTAL HEALTH.

02:57:31.874 --> 02:57:33.943
ILLNESSES IT'LL JUST BE MORE

02:57:34.010 --> 02:57:36.178
EXPENSIVE AND SO AGAIN TRYING

02:57:36.245 --> 02:57:37.747
TO UNDERSTAND HOW YOU ARE

02:57:37.813 --> 02:57:41.083
THINKING ABOUT BALANCING THOSE

02:57:41.150 --> 02:57:42.918
POLICY IMPERATIVES. YEAH AN AND

02:57:42.985 --> 02:57:44.820
WE ARE HAVING DISCUSSIONS AND

02:57:44.887 --> 02:57:46.122
WE ARE LOOKING AT IT AND SEEING

02:57:46.188 --> 02:57:51.660
WHAT THE POLICY OUTCOMES ARE-

02:57:51.727 --> 02:57:54.897
YOU KNOW WE WILL YOU KNOW

02:57:54.964 --> 02:57:55.531
OBVIOUSLY WE'RE LOOKING AT IT

02:57:55.598 --> 02:57:58.701
AND- WELL WE WILL ADDRESS IT AS

02:57:58.768 --> 02:58:01.704
SOON AND- WHEN WE DO THIS COULD

02:58:01.771 --> 02:58:02.938
I COULD I GET AN UPDATE AND

02:58:03.005 --> 02:58:04.507
MAYBE IN IN THE NEXT TWO WEEKS

02:58:04.573 --> 02:58:06.308
COULD YOUR OFFICE. GIVE US AN

02:58:06.375 --> 02:58:08.778
UPDATE ON. MY PERSPECTIVE ON

02:58:08.844 --> 02:58:11.480
THE BAY AREA AS WELL AS- ON HOW

02:58:11.547 --> 02:58:12.681
WE'RE ADDRESSING SOME OF THESE

02:58:12.748 --> 02:58:15.217
MORE CHRONICALLY- THE SET THESE

02:58:15.284 --> 02:58:21.657
CHRONIC. BECAUSE UP OKAY- WORD

02:58:21.724 --> 02:58:22.858
AND DISCUSSIONS WILL GET BACK

02:58:22.925 --> 02:58:23.659
TO YOU AND I REALLY WANNA MAKE

02:58:23.726 --> 02:58:26.228
SURE THAT THE CYCLE WE'RE GOING

02:58:26.295 --> 02:58:28.431
TO APPROVE ANOTHER FIVE HUNDRED

02:58:28.497 --> 02:58:28.964
BILLION WE HAVE SOME GOOD

02:58:29.031 --> 02:58:31.901
ANSWERS ON THIS. OKAY AND ONE

02:58:31.967 --> 02:58:34.270
FINAL QUESTION HAS THERE BEEN

02:58:34.336 --> 02:58:35.838
DISCUSSION ABOUT GIVING TO CAC

02:58:35.905 --> 02:58:38.707
THE AUTHORITY TO DEPLOY THE

02:58:38.774 --> 02:58:39.475
FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS

02:58:39.542 --> 02:58:40.709
AND STATE CREDITS WERE TALKING

02:58:40.776 --> 02:58:43.546
ABOUT THIS YEAR IN EITHER THE

02:58:43.612 --> 02:58:45.815
4% OR THE 9% FEDERAL TAX CREDIT

02:58:45.881 --> 02:58:48.717
PROGRAMS IN YEARS WHEN TAX

02:58:48.784 --> 02:58:51.687
EXEMPT BONDS ARE COMPETITIVE- I

02:58:51.754 --> 02:58:53.222
THINK I'VE I'VE HEARD. I'VE

02:58:53.289 --> 02:58:54.657
HEARD DISCUSSION ON THAT AND I

02:58:54.723 --> 02:58:58.194
THINK- THE THOUGHT PROCESS

02:58:58.260 --> 02:59:01.330
BEHIND THAT WAS THAT. D. IN THE

02:59:01.397 --> 02:59:03.032
CREDITS IF THE CREDITS IF

02:59:03.099 --> 02:59:04.667
THERE'S ENOUGH PROJECTS TO

02:59:04.733 --> 02:59:06.268
FULLY UTILIZE THE FEDERAL

02:59:06.335 --> 02:59:08.904
CREDIT ON THE 4% SITE- AND THE

02:59:08.971 --> 02:59:11.307
BONDS- BECAUSE THAT WAS THE

02:59:11.373 --> 02:59:13.309
WHOLE ISSUE RIGHT. OF THE-

02:59:13.375 --> 02:59:16.979
BOBCAT WAS NOT BEING USED-

02:59:17.046 --> 02:59:18.414
ASSUMING THAT I THINK-

02:59:18.481 --> 02:59:21.517
PROVIDING AUTHORITY TO THE

02:59:21.584 --> 02:59:23.752
HOUSING AGENCY COULD BE COULD

02:59:23.819 --> 02:59:28.757
BE A- HOPSIN- HOWEVER YOU KNOW

02:59:28.824 --> 02:59:30.292
THAT RIGHT NOW BECAUSE THERE IS

02:59:30.359 --> 02:59:31.427
A SPECIFIC AMOUNT OF STATE

02:59:31.494 --> 02:59:33.462
CREDITS MADE AVAILABLE 29%

02:59:33.529 --> 02:59:36.966
PROJECTS AND- IT WOULD

02:59:37.032 --> 02:59:39.034
ESTABLISH PROBABLY BIGGER POTS

02:59:39.101 --> 02:59:41.237
I GUESS. FOR THE 9% PROJECTS IF

02:59:41.303 --> 02:59:42.805
THOSE WERE MADE AVAILABLE BUT I

02:59:42.872 --> 02:59:59.088
WOULD HAVE. TO PROBABLY BE DONE

02:59:59.155 --> 02:59:59.688
AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR.

02:59:59.755 --> 03:00:04.260
WHICH. AND FOR COLLEAGUES YOU

03:00:04.326 --> 03:00:05.294
KNOW STATE LAW PROHIBITS THE

03:00:05.361 --> 03:00:08.564
USE OF 4% STATE TAX CREDITS-

03:00:08.631 --> 03:00:11.367
WITH 9% CREDITS- AND I THINK

03:00:11.433 --> 03:00:13.102
THE IDEA THAT GIVING TO CAP THE

03:00:13.169 --> 03:00:15.304
FLEXIBILITY TO ALLOW THE STATE

03:00:15.371 --> 03:00:17.106
TAX RATE IS TO BE PAIRED. WITH

03:00:17.173 --> 03:00:18.607
9% COULD HELP BETTER LEVERAGE

03:00:18.674 --> 03:00:20.809
THESE CREDIT SO- AGAIN WHY

03:00:20.876 --> 03:00:22.211
DON'T LET'S YOU KNOW WHAT I

03:00:22.278 --> 03:00:23.078
WANT WHAT I THINK WHAT I'D

03:00:23.145 --> 03:00:25.114
SUGGEST IS IF MY OFFICE IF WE

03:00:25.181 --> 03:00:26.315
COULD HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH

03:00:26.382 --> 03:00:28.350

03:00:28.417 --> 03:00:29.585
