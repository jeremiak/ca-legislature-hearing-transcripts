FORTY FIVE DAYS TO SIX MONTHS.

00:59:14.851 --> 00:59:17.921 region:rollup2
FAMILIES WITH LOW INCOMES CAN

00:59:16.086 --> 00:59:19.423 region:rollup2

BE UNAWARE OF THE THREAT F

00:59:35.739 --> 00:59:40.444 region:rollup2
VACCINE PREVENTABLE DISEASES.

00:59:39.075 --> 00:59:42.145 region:rollup2
AB NINETEEN NINETY TWO IN THE

RESEARCH SHOWS PENALTIES DO NOT

01:00:07.337 --> 01:00:10.273 region:rollup2
INCREASE IMMUNIZATION RATES THEY

01:00:08.872 --> 01:00:11.842 region:rollup2
SIMPLY DRIVE FAMILIES FURTHER

01:00:10.273 --> 01:00:13.643 region:rollup2
INTO POVERTY.

01:00:11.842 --> 01:00:14.177 region:rollup2
RESEARCH ALSO SHOWS THAT

01:00:13.643 --> 01:00:16.613 region:rollup2
SUPPORTING FAMILIES WITH

01:00:14.177 --> 01:00:19.416 region:rollup2
INFORMATION DOES DOES ACTUALLY

01:00:16.613 --> 01:00:20.550 region:rollup2
INCREASE IMMUNIZATION RATES.

01:00:19.416 --> 01:00:21.918 region:rollup2

OKAY.

01:00:31.027 --> 01:00:33.063 region:rollup2
I COMMAND CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE

COMMITTEE DOES HAVE ARE FULL OF

01:00:33.063 --> 01:00:35.398 region:rollup2
THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND

01:00:33.697 --> 01:00:37.033 region:rollup2
POVERTY ALSO CO SPONSORED THE

01:00:35.398 --> 01:00:38.568 region:rollup2
BILL IN ADDITIONTO THE THINGS

01:00:37.033 --> 01:00:40.003 region:rollup2
OTHER THE BILL HAS ALREADY BEEN

01:00:38.568 --> 01:00:41.404 region:rollup2
MENTIONED TO DO. I WANT TO POINT

01:00:40.003 --> 01:00:43.807 region:rollup2
OUT THAT IT ALSO REQUIRES THE

01:00:41.404 --> 01:00:45.775 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT TO REGULARLY INFORM

01:00:43.807 --> 01:00:47.811 region:rollup2
AT THE PUBLIC IN THE LEGISLATURE

01:00:45.775 --> 01:00:49.713 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE STATUS OF THE

01:00:47.811 --> 01:00:50.947 region:rollup2
VACCINATION COMPLIANCE. THIS IS

01:00:49.713 --> 01:00:52.082 region:rollup2
REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE.

01:00:50.947 --> 01:00:54.584 region:rollup2
AS MY COLLEAGUE TO THE LEFT OF

01:00:52.082 --> 01:00:56.453 region:rollup2
ME CAN ATTEST FOR YEARS WE

01:00:54.584 --> 01:00:57.921 region:rollup2
REQUESTED THIS INFORMATION IT

01:00:56.453 --> 01:01:00.190 region:rollup2
TOOK A LONG TIME TO GET IT.

01:00:57.921 --> 01:01:02.025 region:rollup2
AND WHEN WE GOT IT IT WAS A

01:01:00.190 --> 01:01:03.426 region:rollup2
PROFOUNDLY DISTURBING TO LEARN

01:01:02.025 --> 01:01:04.995 region:rollup2
ABOUT THOUSANDS OF CHILDREN WHO

01:01:03.426 --> 01:01:06.129 region:rollup2
ARE DEEPLY IMPOVERISHED GOING

01:01:04.995 --> 01:01:09.332 region:rollup2
WITHOUT VACCINATION AND A

01:01:06.129 --> 01:01:11.468 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT HAS. NO IDEA WHY WE

01:01:09.332 --> 01:01:12.969 region:rollup2
DON'T KNOW TO THIS DAY WHETHER

01:01:11.468 --> 01:01:14.337 region:rollup2
OR NOT IT'S BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T

01:01:12.969 --> 01:01:15.739 region:rollup2
THEY ABILITY TO VERIFY THEY'VE

01:01:14.337 --> 01:01:17.073 region:rollup2
LOST A VERIFICATION DID

01:01:15.739 --> 01:01:19.009 region:rollup2
HOMELESSNESS OR DOMESTIC THING

01:01:17.073 --> 01:01:20.577 region:rollup2
DOMESTIC ABUSE. WE DON'T KNOW TO

01:01:19.009 --> 01:01:22.178 region:rollup2
THIS DAY IF THEY COULD USE A

01:01:20.577 --> 01:01:24.347 region:rollup2
LITTLE HELP AND THAT WOULD HELP

01:01:22.178 --> 01:01:25.515 region:rollup2
THEM TO TO OF VERIFY. ALREADY IN

01:01:24.347 --> 01:01:27.317 region:rollup2
THE LAW THERE'S AN OPT OUT

01:01:25.515 --> 01:01:30.053 region:rollup2
PROVISION FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE A

01:01:27.317 --> 01:01:30.554 region:rollup2
MEDICAL OR PERSONAL BELIEF SO IT

01:01:30.053 --> 01:01:32.122 region:rollup2
ISN'T BECAUSE OF THAT.

01:01:30.554 --> 01:01:34.357 region:rollup2
IT'S BECAUSE THEY ACTUALLY

01:01:32.122 --> 01:01:35.859 region:rollup2
AREN'T THERE ART VACCINATED AND

01:01:34.357 --> 01:01:37.794 region:rollup2
AND NOT FOR ANY OTHER REASON.

01:01:35.859 --> 01:01:38.528 region:rollup2
SO THIS IS REALLY TROUBLING TO

01:01:37.794 --> 01:01:40.630 region:rollup2
ME THAT WE.

01:01:38.528 --> 01:01:42.232 region:rollup2
HAVE GOTTEN THIS FAR TWENTY

01:01:40.630 --> 01:01:43.366 region:rollup2
YEARS OF THE CAL WORKS PROGRAM

01:01:42.232 --> 01:01:46.102 region:rollup2
AND WHAT IT SUGGESTS IS THAT

01:01:43.366 --> 01:01:47.804 region:rollup2
THIS POLICY WAS NEVER INTENDED

01:01:46.102 --> 01:01:49.673 region:rollup2
TO MAKE SURE THAT KIDS.

01:01:47.804 --> 01:01:51.007 region:rollup2
WERE VACCINATED. THIS WAS THAT

01:01:49.673 --> 01:01:53.310 region:rollup2
THIS THIS PROVISION OF THE LAW

01:01:51.007 --> 01:01:54.744 region:rollup2
WAS PASSED UNDER PETE WILSON AND

01:01:53.310 --> 01:01:55.545 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTED BY ELOISE ANDERSON

01:01:54.744 --> 01:01:57.581 region:rollup2
AND.

01:01:55.545 --> 01:01:58.949 region:rollup2
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IF THEY HAD

01:01:57.581 --> 01:02:00.417 region:rollup2
REALLY INTENDED FOR PEOPLE TO.

01:01:58.949 --> 01:02:02.185 region:rollup2
VERIFY THAT THE CHILDREN WILL

01:02:00.417 --> 01:02:03.486 region:rollup2
BECOME A VACCINATED THERE WOULD

01:02:02.185 --> 01:02:04.187 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN THIS KIND OF INTEREST

01:02:03.486 --> 01:02:05.922 region:rollup2
INTERVENTION FROM THE VERY

01:02:04.187 --> 01:02:07.457 region:rollup2
BEGINNING TO MAKE SURE THAT THE

01:02:05.922 --> 01:02:08.858 region:rollup2
FAMILIES WHEN THEY WEREN'T ABLE

01:02:07.457 --> 01:02:10.894 region:rollup2
TO VERIFY THAT THE NATION. THAT

01:02:08.858 --> 01:02:11.428 region:rollup2
THEY WERE SUPPORTED TO FIND

01:02:10.894 --> 01:02:12.162 region:rollup2
THEIR WAY TO A VACCINATION

01:02:11.428 --> 01:02:14.764 region:rollup2
CLINIC.

01:02:12.162 --> 01:02:16.933 region:rollup2
SO I'M I'M THRILLED BEYOND

01:02:14.764 --> 01:02:18.468 region:rollup2
WORDS THAT A BITASSEMBLYMEMBER

01:02:16.933 --> 01:02:20.837 region:rollup2

HAD THOUGH ALCUIN CHILD.

01:05:00.864 --> 01:05:05.435 region:rollup2
I THOUGHT ABOUT TO HAPPEN.

UNABLE TO GET TO FOR WHATEVER

01:05:19.616 --> 01:05:23.887 region:rollup2
REASON.

01:05:21.718 --> 01:05:26.256 region:rollup2
ISN'T THAT THAT EXPORTS SINGLE

01:05:23.887 --> 01:05:29.359 region:rollup2
CHILD INTO DANGER.

01:05:26.256 --> 01:05:30.660 region:rollup2

CRITICAL TIME.

01:05:33.029 --> 01:05:36.800 region:rollup2
I THINK WE HAVE OUR DOCTOR

PEDIATRICIAN CAN ANSWER THAT

01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:40.904 region:rollup2

YOU MAY THINGS A LITTLE BIT LONG

01:06:09.599 --> 01:06:12.402 region:rollup2
BUT WE WANTED TO GIVE IT

01:06:11.100 --> 01:06:13.870 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS AND HE LOOKED AT THE

01:06:12.402 --> 01:06:16.239 region:rollup2
COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT. AS

SHOTS THAT THEY NEED IS NOT

01:06:21.644 --> 01:06:24.714 region:rollup2
SAYING THAT I THOUGHT ONE WAY

01:06:22.745 --> 01:06:26.616 region:rollup2
FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF THE

01:06:24.714 --> 01:06:28.051 region:rollup2
ADULTS BUT NOT OF ME ABOUT A

01:06:26.616 --> 01:06:29.919 region:rollup2
HOUSE THE EXPOSURE OF THE

01:06:28.051 --> 01:06:34.490 region:rollup2

CHILDREN'S WE GO. EVEN LONGER

01:06:39.128 --> 01:06:42.432 region:rollup2
WITHOUT.

01:06:40.396 --> 01:06:45.635 region:rollup2
AND IMAGINATION.

01:06:42.432 --> 01:06:48.938 region:rollup2
SO DISTANT DISPEL HAVE NO IMPACT

01:06:45.635 --> 01:06:50.006 region:rollup2
TO DATE DILUTED TO THE HEALTH.

01:06:48.938 --> 01:06:51.641 region:rollup2
OWN OR DID RISK

01:06:50.006 --> 01:06:54.244 region:rollup2
OF TO CHILDREN IT WILL ONLY

01:06:51.641 --> 01:06:56.913 region:rollup2
IMPROVE LAURIE IT REDUCED THE

01:06:54.244 --> 01:06:58.948 region:rollup2
RISK OF THE CHILDREN.

01:06:56.913 --> 01:07:00.717 region:rollup2
BECAUSE NOW WE'RE PROVIDING A

01:06:58.948 --> 01:07:02.785 region:rollup2
HOME AND THEN DONE THE TO

01:07:00.717 --> 01:07:04.387 region:rollup2
TRANSPORTATION AND ALL THOSE

01:07:02.785 --> 01:07:05.822 region:rollup2
NECESSARY STEP.

01:07:04.387 --> 01:07:08.892 region:rollup2
TO TO HELP THEM TO GET THE SHOTS

01:07:05.822 --> 01:07:09.559 region:rollup2
THINGY.

01:07:08.892 --> 01:07:12.028 region:rollup2
I WOULD LIKE TO DO IT OR ANY

01:07:09.559 --> 01:07:14.163 region:rollup2
PROVIDING UNNECESSARY RESOURCE

01:07:12.028 --> 01:07:15.899 region:rollup2
SUNRISE I TRUST PROTEST RABA

01:07:14.163 --> 01:07:16.933 region:rollup2
ENDING AS A ONE GAME LEAD THEM

01:07:15.899 --> 01:07:19.202 region:rollup2
BUT TODAY EXTENSION IS SO WHAT

01:07:16.933 --> 01:07:19.802 region:rollup2
ARE I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE WAY

01:07:19.202 --> 01:07:21.537 region:rollup2
THAT THAT'S THE CRITICAL TIME

01:07:19.802 --> 01:07:25.008 region:rollup2
IS.

01:07:21.537 --> 01:07:26.309 region:rollup2
REALLY GOOD FOR CHILDREN ARE

01:07:25.008 --> 01:07:28.044 region:rollup2
NOT.

01:07:26.309 --> 01:07:29.779 region:rollup2
RIGHT THE A AGAIN I JUST WANT TO

01:07:28.044 --> 01:07:31.648 region:rollup2
REPEAT THAT. WOULD ALL THIS BILL

01:07:29.779 --> 01:07:33.950 region:rollup2
DOES CHILDREN COULDN'T COOK MAKO

01:07:31.648 --> 01:07:35.385 region:rollup2
EVEN LONGER. WITH. AND MEDICINE

01:07:33.950 --> 01:07:37.287 region:rollup2
NATION.

01:07:35.385 --> 01:07:38.821 region:rollup2
SO DOES BILL WOULD.

01:07:37.287 --> 01:07:41.524 region:rollup2
WE WILL GO AND EDUCATE THEM

01:07:38.821 --> 01:07:43.326 region:rollup2
ANGER ANYWAYS DR.

01:07:41.524 --> 01:07:45.395 region:rollup2
CHURCH SO JUST FOR CLARIFICATION

01:07:43.326 --> 01:07:47.797 region:rollup2
I WORKED IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM

01:07:45.395 --> 01:07:50.566 region:rollup2
AND NOT AS A PEDIATRIC.

01:07:47.797 --> 01:07:52.468 region:rollup2
IN AND SECOND I WOULD CONCUR

01:07:50.566 --> 01:07:53.937 region:rollup2
THAT THE SOONER WE CAN GET THE

01:07:52.468 --> 01:07:55.204 region:rollup2
VACCINATIONS THE BETTER BUT

01:07:53.937 --> 01:07:57.373 region:rollup2
THOSE ARE INDIVIDUAL CHOICES

01:07:55.204 --> 01:07:58.441 region:rollup2
BETWEEN PATIENTS AND PROVIDERS.

01:07:57.373 --> 01:08:00.910 region:rollup2
IT SEEMS THAT THIS BILL IS

01:07:58.441 --> 01:08:01.711 region:rollup2
ATTEMPTING TO GET PATIENTS TO

01:08:00.910 --> 01:08:03.179 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS IN A MORE TIMELY

01:08:01.711 --> 01:08:04.647 region:rollup2
FASHION. AND TO PROVIDE

01:08:03.179 --> 01:08:09.485 region:rollup2
RESOURCES WITH THAT AND I SEE A

01:08:04.647 --> 01:08:10.353 region:rollup2
REAL BENEFIT TO THAT.

01:08:09.485 --> 01:08:11.654 region:rollup2
BUT ANY OTHER ONE THING THAT I

01:08:10.353 --> 01:08:12.488 region:rollup2
COULD JUST ADD.

01:08:11.654 --> 01:08:14.290 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THAT THE.

01:08:12.488 --> 01:08:16.392 region:rollup2
THE IMMUNIZATION SCHEDULE LET

01:08:14.290 --> 01:08:18.094 region:rollup2
THE DOCTORS TELL US ALL TO

01:08:16.392 --> 01:08:19.629 region:rollup2
IMMUNIZE A CHILDREN WITH THEN

01:08:18.094 --> 01:08:21.097 region:rollup2
ISN'T CHANGING AT ALL RIGHT THAT

01:08:19.629 --> 01:08:23.166 region:rollup2
WILL STILL BE THE SAME. AND WHAT

01:08:21.097 --> 01:08:25.134 region:rollup2
WAS MOLD CHANGES IF THE FAMILY

01:08:23.166 --> 01:08:27.470 region:rollup2
DOESN'T PROVIDE VERIFICATION.

01:08:25.134 --> 01:08:28.905 region:rollup2
THEY'RE NOT CUT OFF BENEFITS

01:08:27.470 --> 01:08:30.473 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE ONLY THING THAT WILL

01:08:28.905 --> 01:08:32.275 region:rollup2
CHANGE THEY'RE NOT SANCTION THE

01:08:30.473 --> 01:08:33.443 region:rollup2
BENEFITS AND WE ALREADY KNOW

01:08:32.275 --> 01:08:34.777 region:rollup2
THAT THAT SANCTION OF BENEFITS.

01:08:33.443 --> 01:08:36.512 region:rollup2
ISN'T RETURNING THE CHILDREN

01:08:34.777 --> 01:08:38.314 region:rollup2
BACK TO GET VACCINATION INSTEAD

01:08:36.512 --> 01:08:40.283 region:rollup2
IT'S CUTTING THE PARENT AND THE

01:08:38.314 --> 01:08:40.750 region:rollup2
SUPPORT SERVICES TO GET THE

01:08:40.283 --> 01:08:42.619 region:rollup2
VACCINATION.

01:08:40.750 --> 01:08:43.987 region:rollup2
OFF FROM THAT FAMILY AND THAT'S

01:08:42.619 --> 01:08:45.555 region:rollup2
WHY IT'S ELONGATING THE PERIOD

01:08:43.987 --> 01:08:46.889 region:rollup2
OF TIME AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE

01:08:45.555 --> 01:08:48.124 region:rollup2
THOUSANDS OF KIDS UNVACCINATED

01:08:46.889 --> 01:08:50.059 region:rollup2
AND WE HAVE NO CONNECTION TO

01:08:48.124 --> 01:08:51.394 region:rollup2
THEIR PARENTS TO HELP GET THEM

01:08:50.059 --> 01:08:53.429 region:rollup2
BACK IN. TO VACCINATE.

01:08:51.394 --> 01:08:55.498 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S THAT'S WHY THE BILL

01:08:53.429 --> 01:08:57.033 region:rollup2
I'M WORKS TO ACTUALLY SHORTENED

01:08:55.498 --> 01:08:58.701 region:rollup2
FOR THIS VERY REASON HAS WORKED

01:08:57.033 --> 01:08:59.836 region:rollup2
WE'RE VERY CONCERNED JUST LIKE

01:08:58.701 --> 01:09:01.204 region:rollup2
YOU.

01:08:59.836 --> 01:09:02.405 region:rollup2
AND CONGRATULATIONS FOR YOUR

01:09:01.204 --> 01:09:04.040 region:rollup2
PICK BONTA.

01:09:02.405 --> 01:09:04.874 region:rollup2
WE'RE VERY CONCERNED THAT THESE

01:09:04.040 --> 01:09:07.010 region:rollup2
CHILDREN ARE GOING WITHOUT

01:09:04.874 --> 01:09:07.910 region:rollup2
VACCINATIONS AND WHAT'S WHAT

01:09:07.010 --> 01:09:09.746 region:rollup2
WE'VE LEARNED IS THAT THE

01:09:07.910 --> 01:09:11.414 region:rollup2
CURRENT INTERVENTION TO CUT THEM

01:09:09.746 --> 01:09:13.282 region:rollup2
OFF FROM BENEFITS. IS ACTUALLY

01:09:11.414 --> 01:09:15.952 region:rollup2
HAVING THE OPPOSITE EFFECT OF

01:09:13.282 --> 01:09:16.886 region:rollup2
BRINGING THEM BACK IN SO INSTEAD

01:09:15.952 --> 01:09:19.355 region:rollup2
OF DOING THAT.

01:09:16.886 --> 01:09:22.291 region:rollup2
OFFERING THEM HELP UP TO GET THE

01:09:19.355 --> 01:09:23.659 region:rollup2
VACCINATED AND AND WITH URGENCY.

01:09:22.291 --> 01:09:24.694 region:rollup2
WHAT THE FACT THAT WE HAVE NO

01:09:23.659 --> 01:09:26.529 region:rollup2
IDEA WHAT THE FORTY FIVE THIS

01:09:24.694 --> 01:09:28.664 region:rollup2
CAME FROM?

01:09:26.529 --> 01:09:30.566 region:rollup2
WAS OUT OF THE BLUE SKY.

01:09:28.664 --> 01:09:32.435 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S ONE THING THE SECOND

01:09:30.566 --> 01:09:33.102 region:rollup2
THING IS THAT THE SIX MONTH OF

01:09:32.435 --> 01:09:35.204 region:rollup2

01:09:33.102 --> 01:09:37.273 region:rollup2

GIVE PEOPLE MAXWELL FLEXIBILITY

01:09:41.044 --> 01:09:45.381 region:rollup2
GIVEN THE FACT THAT IT TAKES

01:09:42.145 --> 01:09:47.617 region:rollup2
MONTHS TO GET AN APPOINTMENT

01:09:45.381 --> 01:09:48.718 region:rollup2
THESE DAYS WITH THE DOCTOR.

01:09:47.617 --> 01:09:49.318 region:rollup2
WITHOUT ACTED IN THE SEVENTIES

01:09:48.718 --> 01:09:50.453 region:rollup2

CENTURY.
