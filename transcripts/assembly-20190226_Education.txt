SB ONE TWENTY SIX ENSURES THAT CHARTER SCHOOLS COMPLY WITH THE SAME TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY LAWS THAT ALL OF OUR OTHER PUBLIC SCHOOLS CURRENTLY FOLLOW. AS YOU KNOW THE GOVERNOR RECENTLY CALLED FOR SWIFT ACTION TO RESOLVE ONGOING CHARTER SCHOOL TRANSPARENCY ISSUES WELL CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE UNIQUE IN MANY WAYS. THEIR PUBLICLY FUNDED AND YET THEY LACK THE SAME TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY REQUIREMENTS THE GOVERNOR OTHER PUBLICLY FUNDED EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS. UNDER THIS BILL CHARTER SCHOOL GOVERNING BOARDS WILL BE REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH THE SAME OPEN MEETING CONFLICT OF INTEREST AND DISCLOSE DISCLOSURE DISCLOSURE. LAWS AS TRADITIONAL PUBLIC SCHOOLS THAT MEMBERS OF CHARTER SCHOOL GOVERNING BOARDS CANNOT USER POSITIONS FOR PERSONAL OR POLITICAL GAME. FOR SEVERAL YEARS THE LEGISLATURE HAS ATTEMPTED TO BRING CLARITY TO THIS ISSUE FORTUNATELY OUR ATTORNEY GENERAL RECENTLY PUBLISHED AN OPINION CLEARLY STATING THAT YES THESE GOOD GOVERNMENT LAWS DO APPLY TO CHARTER SCHOOL GOVERNING BOARDS. WHILE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OPINION PROVIDE SOME MUCH NEEDED CLARITY ON WHETHER OR NOT THESE LAWS APPLY TO CHARTER SCHOOL GOVERNING BOARDS. THE OPINION IS NOT LEGALLY BINDING. ABSENT THE MEASURE BEFORE YOU TODAY WHICH CODIFIES THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OPINION DISPUTES WILL CONTINUE TO HAPPEN ACROSS THE STATE OVER HOW THESE LAWS APPLY TO CHARTER SCHOOLS.

I AM PLEASED TO BE A JOINT AUTHOR OF THIS IMPORTANT BILL. THIS IS A GOOD GOVERNMENT BILL IT APPLIES GOOD GOVERNMENT LOST TO CHARTER SCHOOL OPERATIONS. THIS BILL ENSURES THAT CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS ARE LEARNING CENTERS NOT PROFIT CENTERS. THIS BILL SEEKS TO ENSURE THAT THE USE OF OUR PRECIOUS FEW PUBLIC SCHOOL DOLLARS ARE SUBJECT TO TRANSPARENCY. COMMON ETHICAL PRACTICES AND GOOD GOVERNMENT LAW THAT IS APPLIED TO OTHER GOVERNMENTAL OPERATIONS ACROSS OUR STATE. THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL HAS BEEN SHARED HAS VERY RECENTLY OPINED THAT THESE LAWS DO APPLY TO CHARTER SCHOOLS BUT THIS BILL PROVIDES ADDED CLARITY. THIS BILL PROTECTS PRESSURES EDUCATION DOLLARS WHICH SHOULD BE USED FOR STUDENTS IN SCHOOLS NOT PROFITS. THE LIST OF CHARTER SCHOOLS IN THE HISTORY FISCAL MISMANAGEMENT IS LONG CELERITY MAGNOLIA AND TRY VALLEY LEARNING CORPORATION ARE JUST A FEW. IT HAS BEEN THE WILD WEST IN CALIFORNIA THAT'S FAR WITH REGARD TO THESE DOLLARS. INTO -- NOW THESE SCHOOLS HAVE RECEIVED SIGNIFICANT A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF PUBLIC MONEY BUT NO ACCOUNTABILITY AND IN FACT. HAVE ARGUED THAT A CONFLICT OF INTEREST OR LACK OF ENTRANCED RANTS PERRANCE HE WAS ACTUALLY ALLOWABLE. UNDER THE LAW. LOCALLY ELECTED PUBLIC SCHOOL BOARD MEMBERS HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO TRANSPARENCY AND ETHICAL STANDARDS SO TOO SHOULD CHARTER SCHOOL OPERATIONS. I URGE YOU TO SUPPORT THIS CRITICAL MEASURE TO PROTECT ALL OF OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND OUR PUBLIC DOLLARS. THANK YOU SIR. MISTER VICE CHAIR OF THEM IN SUPPORT. YES WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. MR CHAIR AND MEMBERS SETH BRAMBLE HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION PLEASED TO SUPPORT THE SENATE BILL. ONE TWO SIX CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE PUBLIC SCHOOLS THAT WERE ESTABLISHED WITH THE PROMISE WILL GIVE YOU THE FREEDOM TO INNOVATE AND YOU'LL SHOW US RESULTS LIKE LIGHT HOUSES THEY WERE PLACE WHERE WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT. AND THEN APPLY -- ANYTHING WE'VE LEARNED ACROSS THE PUBLIC EDUCATION I WAS EXCITED TO HEAR FROM THE CHARTER SCHOOL DIVISION DIRECTOR IN OAKLAND UNIFIED ABOUT A SYSTEM HE CALLED. KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER WHERE THE PRINCIPLES THAT CHARTER SCHOOLS AND THE PRINCIPLES THAT TRADITIONAL PUBLIC SCHOOLS WE COME TOGETHER AND SHARE BEST PRACTICES AND THAT'S WHAT WAS INTENDED HERE LESSONS LEARNED. BUT THE PEOPLE CANNOT LEARN FROM THIS INNOVATION IF THE PEOPLE'S BUSINESS AND CAN IS CONDUCTED IN PRIVATE -- WE DID NOT INTEND -- THE CHARTER SCHOOLS TO DO AS THEY WISH WITH PUBLIC FUNDS -- TO THE CONTRARY WE INSIST ON RETAINING CONTROL AND ON STAYING INFORMED THE ESTABLISHMENT OF CHARTER SCHOOLS WITH NOT US THE PUBLIC YIELDING CONTROL TO THE AGENCIES THAT SERVE US -- HAVING PRIVATE AND SECRET MEETINGS ABOUT HOW TAX DOLLARS ARE BEING SPENT IS NOT INNOVATION IT DOES NOT BENEFIT THE SYSTEM AND IN FACT IT'S RESULTED IN A NUMBER OF COURSE STORIES AS A MISTER CHAIR MENTIONED -- WHAT THIS BILL IS SAYING TO CHARTER SCHOOLS IS -- BY ALL MEANS DO WHAT YOU WANT BUT DO IT OUT IN THE OPEN WHERE EVERYONE CAN SEE I CAN CERTAINLY PROVIDE YOU EXAMPLES OF SOME OF THESE -- HORROR STORIES IF THE COMMITTEE DESIRES BUT SURELY WHAT THIS BILL IS SAYING IS YOU KNOW TO CHARTER SCHOOLS IS DREAM BIG AND THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX BUT DON'T ABUSE THE PUBLIC TRUST AND SPEND THAT MONEY ON OUR STUDENTS PUBLIC EDUCATION MUST BE.

THESE RULES -- IN THESE CASES AUTHORIZES OF WORK COOPERATIVELY WITH CHARTER PETITIONERS AYE TO CHIEF COMPLIANCE UNFORTUNATELY IN SOME INSTANCES SOME CHARTER SCHOOLS. AREN'T COMPLYING -- AND THE AUTHORIZED OR DOESN'T HAVE THE CAPACITY AT THIS POINT IN ORDER TO COMPEL THAT COMPLIANCE -- ED [inaudible] SEE -- SB YOU -- ONE TWENTY SIX WOULD CREATE SOME CONSISTENCY AROUND THIS THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND OUT IN. ENSURE THAT PARENTS AND STUDENTS HAVE THE ABILITY TO PARTICIPATE IN DECISION MAKING PROCESS I AT CHARTER SCHOOLS. ARE THE FACT THAT SOME CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE ALREADY AND HEARING TO THE STATUTES NOW -- INDICATES THAT COMPLIANCE WOULD NECESSARILY BE A PROBLEM FOR ME THE CHARTER SCHOOLS OUT THERE. ARE THE BILL WOULD ENSURE THE CHARTERS SCHOOLS FOLLOW THE BASIC REQUIREMENTS AND HELP IMPROVE OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY FOR IT. AUTHORIZES BOTH AT THE COUNTY AND AT SCHOOL DISTRICT LEVEL -- AT A TIME WHEN WE'RE TRYING TO INCREASE PARENT AND COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT -- HAVING THESE. A STATUTES IN PLACE WOULD ENSURE THAT PARENTS AND STUDENTS HAVE ACCESS TO PUBLIC RECORDS HAVE ACCESS TO MEETINGS AND CAN THAT -- ENSURE THAT THAT THE DECISION MAKERS AT THE CHARTER SCHOOL AREN'T OF IMPACTED BY ANY CONFLICTS. OF FOR THESE REASONS THE SBA SUPPORTS SB ONE TWENTY SIX AND YOU THIS -- TO BASSETT THANK YOU.

WE HAVE A SECOND -- MISTER MCCARTY A SECOND BILL -- AND NOW WE'RE GONNA GO I THINK WE WERE GOING TO SOMETHING UNUSUAL SOMETHING I PROBABLY DON'T IN HER TOO MUCH WE'RE GONNA LET THE NEUTRAL POSITION -- SPEAK. AND YOU GUYS AND IF YOU'VE BEEN AROUND THE COMMITTEE YOU KNOW THAT I DON'T USUALLY LET THE NEUTRAL SPEAK PATES ALL DIFFERENT. SO WITH THAT. ALL PROCEED RESHAPE THAT AT APPRECIATE THE FLEXIBILITY MISTER CHAIR I WILL NOT ABUSE IT NOT EVERYBODY IF. I **** SO I'M. OR NOT IN A LESS THAN WHAT I'M NOT GOING TO SAY IN THE BALANCE OF MY TIME REVIEWING SOME OF THE MISS CARE. MIS CHARACTERIZATIONS THAT IN OUR OPINION YOU FOR TODAY ABOUT OUR SECTOR -- BUT PLEASE KNOW THAT WE ARE NEUTRALITY IS NOT A TACIT -- CONSENT TO SOME OF THE RHETORIC THAT YOU'RE HEARING BUT WE DO WANT TO REINFORCES THAT AT CCS A IN THE SECTOR. HAS LONG BEEN ON RECORD PERRANCE SEE -- WITH OPEN MEETINGS AND PUBLIC RECORDS -- AS YOU ALL KNOW THE GOVERNMENT TEN NINETY ISSUE HAS BEEN PRETTY CONTENTIOUS FOR US BUT WE'RE REALLY PROUD THAT WE BELIEVE WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO RESOLVE. A LOT OF OUR ISSUES IN THE AGREEMENT THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS TAKEN LEADERS TAKEN A LEADERSHIP ROLE ON AND SO WE BELIEVE THAT THE PROPOSAL IN FRONT OF YOU IS A BALANCED AND COMPREHENSIVE RESOLUTION. TO WHAT HAS BEEN VEXING AND LONG STANDING DEBATE ON ON THIS ISSUE -- AND WHILE WE WEREN'T ABLE TO BRING OURSELVES TO SUPPORTING THE LEGISLATION. FOR FOR FOR SOME REASONS THAT I WON'T BORE YOU WITH TODAY -- WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS OBVIOUSLY DOESN'T LEND ITSELF TO GETTING EVERYTHING YOU WANT BUT WE DON'T HAVE ANY. MAJOR RESERVATIONS THAT WOULD KEEP US FROM -- YOU KNOW MAKING THE ARGUMENT THAT THE LEGISLATION SHOULD IN ADVANCE TODAY THREE COULD THROUGH COMMITTEE [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU UP. ANY OTHERS IN NEUTRAL. OKAY GREAT -- WITH THAT WILL HAVE THE OPPOSITION COME FORWARD. IF SOMEONE COULD CLEAR THE WAY FOR THE OPPOSITION TO BE MOST APPRECIATE [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR CAPITAL HALLORAN ON BEHALF OF THE CHARTER SCHOOLS DEVELOPMENT CENTER. CAN I AM HERE IN OPPOSITION TODAY AND OF COURSE WE ARE NOT OPPOSED TO TRANSPARENCY. IN GOVERNMENT TRANSPARENT TRANSPARENCY IN CHARTER SCHOOLS -- BUT WE DO BELIEVE THAT THIS IS NOT THE SAME AS WITH APPLY TO TRADITIONAL SCHOOL BOARDS. I SIT ON A TRADITIONAL SCHOOL BOARD AND SO I'M FAMILIAR WITH SOME OF THE RULES AND REGULATIONS. AND I JUST LIKE TO POINT OUT SOME OF THE DISCREPANCIES. WE BELIEVE THIS BILL IS OVERLY PRESCRIPTIVE -- FOR INSTANCE I THINK THAT IT LIMITS PARENTAL INVOLVEMENT WHEN YOU DON'T ALLOW SCHOOLS CHARTER SCHOOLS TO MEET AT DIFFERENT SITES -- THE SCHOOL BOARD THAT I SIT ON WE PRIDE OURSELVES IN BOARD MEETINGS ARE NOT PARTICULARLY ENTERTAINING AND WE REALLY WORK TO GET FOLKS INVOLVED IN AT OUR MEETINGS. SO WE REACH OUT AND GO TO A DIFFERENT SCHOOL SITES THIS PROHIBITS CHARTER SCHOOLS FROM DOING THAT AND THAT SEEMS PARTICULARLY PUNITIVE AND AND SORT OF OPPOSITE OF WHAT THIS BILL IS TRYING TO ACHIEVE. IN ADDITION OTHER THE TRADITIONAL SCHOOL BOARD I SAID WE DO IN FACT BROADCAST OUR MEETINGS BUT THERE ISN'T A TWO WAY -- REQUIREMENT AND SO WHEN WE POSTED ONLINE THERE'S ONLY THE TRANSMISSION OF WHAT FOLKSY FROM OUR BROADCAST. THE IDEA THAT SOME OF OUR CHARTER SCHOOLS HAVE MULTIPLE OUTLETS THE COST OF HAVING TO DO ALL OF IT TO A TRANSMISSION RECORDED AND THEN POSTED. WE THINK IS PARTICULARLY ONEROUS IN PARTICULAR BECAUSE CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE NOT ALLOWED TO GET REIMBURSED FOR STATE MANDATES. SO IT'S AN ADDITIONAL COST IT'S AN ADDITIONAL -- IT'S AN ADDITIONAL COST AND SOMETHING THAT THAT -- TRADITIONAL SCHOOL BOARDS AND DON'T HAVE TO COMPLY WITH SO IT'S REALLY NOT THE SAME AS TRADITIONAL SCHOOL BOARDS -- AND SO THOSE ARE THINGS THAT WE THINK THAT YOU SHOULD CONSIDER WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT THIS BILL AND YET ANOTHER WAY THAT CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE NOT CONSIDERED PUBLIC AGENCIES -- IN IN THE WAY THAT TRADITIONAL SCHOOLS ARE. THANK YOU THANK YOU ANY OTHERS IN OPPOSITION -- TO MISTER CHEN MEMBERS MATTHEW CYBERLINK ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF CLERKS ELECTION OFFICIALS. WE FALL. SORT PROBABLY OUTSIDE OF THE THE GENERAL SCOPE OF SITTING THROUGH NUMEROUS ROUND TABLE DISCUSSIONS AND MANY HOURS OF DISCUSSION ON THIS BILL FOR ARE VERY SMALL PIECE. OF THE WE WERE TRACKING BUT SPECIFICALLY THE MINISTER THE POLITICAL REFORM ACT. WHICH MY CLIENTS ADMINISTER -- OR OVERLY PRESCRIPTIVE -- WE THINK THAT. WE'RE SUPPORTIVE OF CHARTER SCHOOLS BEING SUBJECT TO THE POOR GIRL FOR MAX -- PERIOD BUT THERE ARE MOMENTS WITHIN THE EDUCATION CO THE DICTATE THE MINISTRATION OF MY CLIENTS WOULD HAVE TO A CHANGE SPECIFIC THE CHARTER SCHOOLS OTHER WITH THE BRING THIS TO AN OPPOSE POSITION WE RECOMMEND THAT THOSE. SPECIFICS BE STRUCK IN FROM THE BILL AND CHARTER SCHOOLS BE. SUBJECT TO THE PORTAL FOR MAX PERIOD THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHERS IN OPPOSITION SEE NO OTHERS IN OPPOSITION WILL BRING IT BACK BEHIND THE COMMITTEE WE DO HAVE. A MOTION AND A SECOND -- AND DO WE HAVE ANY COMMENT FROM ANY OF THE MEMBERS [inaudible] WEBER. IF THE VERYHAS COME UNDER QUESTION RAISE YOUR HAND TO SOME SO I KNOW THEY HAVE A RIGHT THERE. SMITH IF I DON'T SEE IT I DON'T KNOW SO. WHY GOT THE SNAP MISTER CHAIR ALL RIGHT? GO FORWARD THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU AS WELL AS SENATOR LEYVA FOR AUTHORING -- THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE I WILL START BY SAYING THAT I WHOLEHEARTEDLY SUPPORT SB ONE TWENTY SIX A VERY MUCH LIKE THIS LEGISLATIVE BODY ALL SCHOOLS AND DISTRICTS SHOULD FIRST AND FOREMOST PROTECT THE STUDENTS AND THE TAXPAYERS THEY SERVE. AS A DUTY I TOOK VERY SERIOUSLY AS A SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER WHO ALWAYS HELD MEETINGS IN PUBLIC ANNOUNCED IN ADVANCE -- WITH THE LOCATION -- SO THAT PARENTS AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS OF ALL GOVERNANCE ALL PARENTS AND STUDENTS SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO THEIR SCHOOL GOVERNANCE IN OPEN TO DISCLOSE MEETINGS ALL PARENTS AND STUDENTS SHOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR VOICES ARE HEARD AND ACCOUNTED. FOR THIS BILL TAKES THE NECESSARY STEPS TO MAKE SURE THERE IS SUNSHINE AND DISCLOSURE IN THE GOVERNANCE PROCESS THE SAME SUNSHINE THAT SHOULD REQUIRED BE REQUIRED OF ALL ENTITIES THAT SERVE THE PUBLIC ESPECIALLY OUR CHILDREN. THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. ANY OTHERS WISHING TO SPEAK. YEAH QUITE -- MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I I FIRST OF ALL WANT TO THANK -- OF THE AUTHORS FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD -- BUT THOSE HAVE BEEN AROUND FOR A LITTLE WHILE KNOW THAT THE ISSUE OF MEETINGS IN TRANSPARENCY AND ALL THE KINDS OF THINGS AT AFFILIATED WITH IT. HAVE HAD A VERY LONG AND STRUGGLING HISTORY OF IN TERMS OF TRYING TO GET SOME AGREEMENT AND UNDERSTANDING. AND I'M APPRECIATIVE OF THE FACT THAT -- THAT THE GOVERNOR -- BASICALLY OF PUSH THIS THROUGH -- IT WITH SOME -- BALANCE I THINK IN TERMS OF SOME OF THE THINGS WE'VE SEEN IN THE PAST WHAT WE SEE TODAY SO. I THINK IT DOES IT IT BUT IT STRIKES A BALANCE THERE ARE STILL SOME ISSUES I THINK THAT NEED TO BE RESOLVED AS POINTED OUT -- I THINK OUR SCHOOLS SCHOOLS SHOULD HAVE THE SAME STANDARDS. AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE ATTEMPTING TO DO -- AND YET OF SOMEONE BRINGS FOR TO US SOME THINGS WHICH I KNOW ARE NOT ALWAYS TRUE BECAUSE I WAS ON THE SCHOOL BOARD AND WE DID MEET IN DIFFERENT SITES BECAUSE EVERY NOW AND THEN WANT TO GO TO A DIFFERENT SCHOOL A DIFFERENT PLACE. DIFFERENT COMMUNITY TO BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER BOOK BOARD MEETING SO THE FACT THAT IF YOU'RE RESTRICTING FOLKS FROM HAVING MEETINGS OF IN ONE PLACE IT BECOMES DIFFICULT. AND WHEN WE DO DO OF A TELEVISED OF THINGS FOR SCHOOL BOARD IS NOT TO WAY. SO THAT COULD BE A DIFFICULT PIECE AND I I HOPE PEOPLE LOOK AT THAT BEFORE IT GOES TO THE FLOOR TO SEE IF THERE'S SOME CUT COMBINATIONS THAT CAN BE MADE. EITHER IN OUR BUDGET -- SITUATION BECAUSE WE OCCASIONALLY DO FUND MANDATES OF BY CHARTERS WE MAKE THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS BUT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT BASICALLY BEING OVERLY BURDENSOME TO CHARTER SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY'RE DIFFERENT AND WE CAN CREATE THESE NEW RULES. WHEN IN REALITY IF THEY SHOULD BE TREATED LIKE THE REGULAR PUBLIC SCHOOLS WITH A KIND OF TRANSPARENCY AND ACCESSIBILITY THAT ALL PARENTS WANT FROM THEIR SCHOOLS -- SO I'M PLEASED THAT THAT WE'VE DONE THAT I HOPE THAT BEFORE THIS GOES TO THE FLOOR THAT THERE IS AN HONEST EFFORT TO LOOK AT THOSE TWO ISSUES. THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED BECAUSE THEY ARE IMPORTANT ISSUES AND THEY DO DISTINGUISH CHARTIST MOTHERS IN TERMS OF HAVING RECOMMENDATIONS THAT ARE OWNERS -- LIKE EVERY SCHOOL I THINK IT LIKE I SAID THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WORK THAT WE'VE DONE HERE -- I WOULD -- PROBABLY TONE DOWN THE RHETORIC A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW HORRIBLE CHARGES ARE OR EITHER HEALTH HOW DIFFICULT IT IS FOR OF ALL THE THINGS THAT TAKE PLACE BECAUSE IF YOU'VE BEEN AROUND SCHOOLS FOR A LITTLE BIT OF TIME YOU KNOW THAT THAT STUFF IS APPLICABLE TO ALMOST. ALL OF THE SCHOOLS AND NOT JUST TO CHARTERS IN TERMS OF MONEY AND WHERE GOALS AND SCHOOLS THAT ARE IN RECEIVERSHIP AND NOT IN RECEIVERSHIP AND WERE HAVING DIFFICULTY IN BANKRUPTCY. I MEAN IT'S JUST GOES ON AND ON AND AND THERE'S A LOT NOT BLAME TO GO AROUND -- WITHOUT ACTUALLY FOCUSING ON ONE SIDE WOULD HATE FOLKS TO THINK THAT THIS IS PARTICULARLY DESIGNED BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT THE SCHOOLS THAT. HAVE GONE AWRY -- IT IT GOING ON IN THE SCHOOLS AND IT SHOULD BE A PART OF THE CONVERSATION I TAKES PLACE ALL THE TIME. I KNOW WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A LOT OF CHARTER STUFF COMING FOR THIS YEAR BY UNDERSTANDING PEOPLE TELL ME. I KNOW THE GOVERNOR'S FORMED A COMMITTEE -- TO BASICALLY DEAL WITH THIS ISSUE I'M OPTIMISTIC AND I KNOW HE HAD A HAND IN THIS BUT I AM OPTIMISTIC AND HOPEFUL. THAT -- MANY OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE'VE BEEN FACING IN THIS UNNECESSARY BATTLE FOR THE LAST. I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY YEARS NOW WILL HOPEFULLY BE RESOLVED TO A BALANCE COMMITTEE -- THAT WE WILL GET SOME GOOD RECOMMENDATIONS AND I WOULD HOPE THAT AS A COMMITTEE OF IT. THE EDUCATION COMMITTEE IN BOTH HOUSES THAT WE WOULD MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO WAIT TO GET THE RECOMMENDATIONS BEFORE WE MOVE FOR WITH A LOT OF LEGISLATION. I THINK IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THIS IS BEEN A VERY DIFFICULT SUBJECT. ALL OVER THE PLACE AND AND IF WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A BLUE RIBBON COMMITTEE THAT'S LOOKING AT CHARTER SCHOOLS. WE SHOULD TRY TO DO OUR BEST TO WAIT TO SEE WHAT THEY COME UP WITH. OTHERWISE WE FIND OURSELVES ONCE AGAIN IS THAT WE SHOULD AND THIS IS ENOUGH DECISION [inaudible] GOVERNOR FOR THIS COMMITTEE THAT WE TAKE OUR TIME TO MAKE SURE THAT THE ISSUES THAT ARE BEING RAISED HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN TAKEN THROUGH WITH SOME THOUGHT -- IN TERMS OF WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO -- THE UNFORTUNATE THING OF BEING IN THE ASSEMBLY. I MEAN LEGISLATURE PERIOD IS THAT OFTENTIMES IS NOT ENOUGH CONVERSATION. IS NOT ENOUGH ACTUAL WORKING COMMITTEES THAT ACTUALLY FOCUS ON THESE ISSUES AND GIVE TIME FOR IT TO HAPPEN OUTSIDE OF THE REALM OF LEGISLATION. AND I THINK THE ISSUE OF CHARTERS IS SO IMPORTANT -- IN CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW AND WITH SUCH A TURNING POINT A CRITICAL POINT OF FIGURING OUT WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IN AND WE'VE BEEN FOR TWENTY SIX YEARS OF WAR CHARTERS. WITHOUT REALLY CLEAR CONVERSATION ACROSS THE BOARD AND WE'VE WORKED INTO THINGS THAT MAYBE WE DIDN'T WANT TO GO INTO AND DIDN'T PRESERVE OF THINGS WITH OVER IMPORTANT AND ON AND ON THAT -- THE BLUE RIBBON COMMITTEE THAT'S BEING FORMED BY THIS NEW SUPERINTENDENT OF IN A PUBLIC INSTRUCTION WITH THE GOVERNOR'S BLESSING OF I HOPE WE'LL HAVE SOME GOOD RECOMMENDATIONS FOR US BY THE BUT AT THE END OF THEIR TURN TIME. THAT WE CAN THEN USE THAT AS A AS A A A PLATFORM FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF LEGISLATION THAT WE THINK WILL BE IMPORTANT FOR CHARTERS AND PUBLIC SCHOOLS AS WE GO FORWARD. AND THAT WE DON'T RUSSIA HERE BUT I THINK THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION IS TIMES COME IT'S BEEN UP MANY MANY TIMES BEFORE. FORTUNATELY WHERE WITH A POINT NOW WHERE THERE'S A AT LEAST SOME UNDERSTANDING OF THE TWO PARTIES THAT WORK TOGETHER AND I AM SUPPORTIVE OF THIS BILL TODAY BUT I HOPE THAT THE ISSUES THEY RAISE WILL BE ALSO CONTINUING THE DISCUSSION. OF WHERE -- WHERE THERE MAY BE SOME INEQUITIES THAT EFFECTIVELY -- WILL SUPPORT THIS ISSUE AS A COME FOR TODAY IN THE CURRENT FORM. THANK YOU SEE NO FURTHER -- COMMITTEE DISCUSSION THE BILL HAS BEEN MOVED AND SECONDED THE MOTION IS TO PASS -- PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. CAN I CALL YOU GOT AND YOU HAVE TO CLOSE THANK YOU DON'T HAVE TO BUT I WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR IN A WHILE YOU KNOW I WOULD JUST LIKE TO PUBLICLY THANK THE GOVERNOR FOR MAKING THIS A PRIORITY. I'VE SAT ON THE EDUCATION COMMITTEE IN THE SENATE FOR FOUR YEARS AND A LOT OF THESE ISSUES HAVE REALLY I THINK DERAILED US FROM A LOT OF THE GOOD WORK THAT WE COULD DO. STUFF LIKE THIS REALLY SETS US ON A GOOD COURSE TO START THE YEAR BOTH IN THE SENATE AND THE ASSEMBLY AND WORK ON OTHER ISSUES. AND I WANT TO THANK BOTH PARTIES BECAUSE SOMEONE WHO NEGOTIATED FOR MANY YEARS IF EVERYONE WALKS AWAY A LITTLE HAPPY AND A LITTLE UNHAPPY IT MEANS THAT WE DID GOOD NEGOTIATIONS I DON'T THINK ANYONE'S WALKING AWAY. FEELING THAT THERE WAS A WINNER AND A LOSER AND ASSEMBLYMAN -- WOMAN WEBER THE TASK FORCE TO MY UNDERSTANDING IS TO DO WITH THE FISCAL ISSUES AND THE SUIT THE FISCAL IMPACT OF CHARTER SCHOOLS HAS BEEN AND IS THAT THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING TO DATE. SO I THINK EVERYONE WHO HAD A HAND IN THIS IT'S JUST A REALLY GOOD WAY TO START OFF THE THE NEW YEAR. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU AND I I WANT TO THANK A ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEDINA. WHO WORKED ON THIS -- YOU SPENDA LOT OF TIME ON THIS ISSUE LAST YEAR WE DIDN'T GET TO WHERE WE WANTED TO GET LAST YEAR -- THERE WAS AN AGREEMENT LAST YEAR BUT I WANT TO ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE HIS HARD WORK ON THIS ISSUE -- AS WELL -- SO WITH THAT THE MOTION IS TO PLAT TO PASS PLEASE CALL THE ROLL WITH. THE MOTION IS TO PASS O'DONNELL AYE O'DONNELL AYE KALRA. KALRA AYE KILEY. KILEY NO MCCARTY [inaudible] I SMITH. SMITH I WEBER [inaudible] WEBER I IT THE THE BILLS OUT FIVE TO ONE THANK YOU.
