SIR WINNER HAS ADVANCED A MOTION IS THERE ANY CONVERSATION UP FROM COMMITTEE MR VICE CHAIR THE FORCE OR SIR HAPPY NEW YEAR SHEERAN LOOKING FOR TO WORK WITH YOU THIS YEAR. THE NEAREST CHAIRMAN GOOD TO BE BACK. I'M GONNA SUPPORT THIS IS I ALWAYS HAVE THE BUT I WANT TO CHALLENGE THE FILM INDUSTRY. TO BE MORE AGGRESSIVE AND PARTICIPATORY IN OPPOSING THINGS THAT THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR DOES THROUGH EXECUTIVE ORDERS THAT HAVE MADE. CALIFORNIA SUCH A TERRIBLE STATE TO DO BUSINESS IN. EVEN THE LARGEST TECH COMPANIES ARE LEAVING CALIFORNIA MULTIPLE OF ACTIONS LEGISLATION COMING THROUGH THIS LEGISLATURE AND EXECUTIVE ORDERS BY THE ADMINISTRATION. AND ONE OF THE BIG PROBLEMS NOW IT'S KIND OF A STEALTH ISSUE. THE LEGISLATURE EVERY YEAR SHE NEEDS MORE OF THE AUTHORITY OF THE PEOPLE. THE IT THROUGH THEM TO THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH GIVING THEM UNILATERAL AUTHORITY. TO MAKE DECISIONS THROUGH ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES SUPPOSEDLY BUT MOST OF ITS COVERT AND SOMEONE THAT I WOULD ARGUE EVEN IS UNDERGROUND REGULATION. MY CHALLENGE THEN TO THE FILM INDUSTRY YOU HAVE A GREAT. POPE PAUL PUT OUT THERE. DIVERGED SPEAKING UP AGAINST THESE ACTIONS OF STATE GOVERNMENT. AND YOU BETTER START DOING IT. YOU DON'T YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE DESERVING OF MORE CREDIT YOU'RE GOING TO BE DESERVING OF LOSING THAT CREDIT AND DESPITE HAVING TO SUFFER LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE SO THAT THAT'S MY ADMONISHMENT TO THE FILM INDUSTRY STAND UP AND OPPOSE SOME OF THESE THINGS DON'T JUST SUPPORT YOUR OWN BENEFIT. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER VICE CHAIR WE'RE GONNA TURN OVER CENTER DRAWS A GOOD MORNING. THANK YOU MR CHAIR- AND I THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD IN HIS WORK LAST YEAR- THIS IS BEEN AN ISSUE THAT I'VE BEEN ACQUAINTED WITH FOR MANY YEARS- WHEN I WAS AT THE ALLEY FEDERATION OF LABOR I REMEMBER. THAT WE HAD TO GET PAST THE PERCEPTION THAT ANY KIND OF A TAX CREDIT WAS ONLY GOING TO BENEFIT THE VERY WEALTHY STUDIO- EXECUTIVES- AND THAT WAS THE PICTURE THAT WAS PAINTED SO THERE WAS NO DESERVING OF ANY TAX CREDIT BECAUSE IT WAS ONLY GOING TO SERVE IT WAS ONLY GOING TO SUPPORT THESE VERY HANDFUL OF VERY WEALTHY PEOPLE WE HAD TO GET THROUGH THAT AND IT TOOK A LOT OF WORK TO SAY WAIT A MINUTE. THIS INDUSTRY IS MADE UP OF FAR MORE WORKING MEN AND WOMEN BOTH IN FRONT OF CAMERA BEHIND CAMERA ALL WHO REALLY- CREATE YOU KNOW WHO WORK IN THE JOBS THAT ARE SO GOOD FOR OUR ECONOMY SO WELL PAID WITH BENEFITS AND ALL OF THAT SO WE GOT THROUGH THAT. GOT THE FIRST TAX CREDITS AND WE'RE MOVING ALONG NOW BUT WHAT- MY CONCERN IS THAT- WE HAVE HAD A COMMITMENT TO DIVERSIFY THE WORKFORCE IN FRONT AND BEHIND THE CAMERA AND IT REALLY HASN'T HAPPENED TO ANY NOTICEABLE DEGREE. THERE'S A FEW THINGS HERE AND THERE. BUT I'M I'M DISAPPOINTED THAT FAR MORE DEEPER COMMITMENT HASN'T RESULTED IN THE CHANGE THAT WE NEED TO HAVE. CALIFORNIA IS KNOWN OF IN EVERY SINGLE WAY FOR OUR DIVERSITY. AND THAT WORD IS USED VERY LOOSELY BY SOME- BUT I'M LOOKING FOR A DEEPER WAY IN WHICH ALL CALIFORNIANS CAN HAVE ACCESS. TO EVERY LEVEL OF THIS INDUSTRY EVERY LEVEL- WE HAD A- AND THE LATINO CAUCUS. A PANEL ON UNSEEN LET THE IN HOUSE AND WE HAD ONE DEDICATED TO THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY IN WHICH AFTER LET THE NOTIN THE VARIOUS PARTS OF THE INDUSTRY. TESTIFIED AS TO HOW THEY WERE LOCKED OUT HOW THEY WERE LEFT OUT HI THEY WEREN'T GIVEN THE TOOLS THE OPPORTUNITIES ARE TO BE ABLE TO- I'LL BE A PART OF THIS INDUSTRY IN AND- OF. THEN WE HEARD TESTIMONY ABOUT- THE PERCENTAGE OF THE VARIOUS COMMUNITIES IN THIS. IN THIS STATE AND AS CONSUMERS. SO CONSUMERS TAXPAYERS ON EVERY LEVEL ARE NOT GETTING THE SAME ACCESS TO THESE JOBS- I UNEQUIVOCALLY SUPPORT GIVING THIS TAX CREDIT BUT- AS WE EXTENDED NOW TO TWENTY TWENTY NINE WHERE DOES THAT LEAVE US HOW SERIOUS WILL THE INDUSTRY TAKE. THE ISSUE OF MUCH DEEPER OF COMMITMENT. TO MAKING THE CHANGE AND HAVING THESEJOBS AND- CAREERS OPENED UP TO EVERYONE IN OUR COMMUNITY UP SO I ALSO SAY TO YOU. THAT I GET CALLS AND LETTERS AND MEETINGS ALL THE TIME. UP FROM- THOSE FEW WHO ARE. HAVE BEEN UNSUCCESSFUL AND IT'S- THERE AND HAVING TO RAISE MONEY PRIVATELY. FOR PROGRAMS TO MENTOR YOUTH. THEY'RE HAVING TO RAISE MONEY PRIVATELY TO RAISE MONEY FOR SCHOLARSHIPS SO THAT THEY COULD GO TO SCHOOL TO BE ABLE TO. ENTER THIS INDUSTRY I THINK THAT'S OUTRAGEOUS AND I REALLY LIKE I COUNT ON THE AND THE AUTHOR. AND THE CO AUTHORS- TO BE MUCH MORE DEMANDING- ON THE OUTCOMES THAT WE SHOULD HAVE I DON'T WANT TO BE HERE IN FOUR YEARS AND SAY WELL WE GOT A REPORT AND WELL WE'LL KEEP TRYING- YOU KNOW ENOUGH IS ENOUGH WITH THAT SO. AGAIN ON THE ONE HAND I AM UNEQUIVOCALLY IN SUPPORT I APPRECIATE OF THE AUTHOR AND- I SPECIALLY LOVE THAT THEY ARE HIGHLY UNIONIZED JOBS AND IN AN INDUSTRY- BUT WE HAVE TO BE MUCH MORE SERVICE ON THIS OTHER FRONT. SO THANK YOU AND. I WOULD LOVE TO BE A COLLECTIVE. THANK YOU SO MUCH CENTER ALSO I'M TURN IT OVER TO SEE TWENTY AND ABOUT SIXTY SECONDS I'M JUST GONNA SAY ONE OF THE ITEMS THAT I APPRECIATED% AND FROM THE FEEDBACK WE HAD ORIGINALLY WHEN THE SPILLS AND PRODUCTIVITY. WHY IS ENSURING THAT THERE IS GOING TO BE GEOGRAPHIC DIVERSITY IN REGARD TO THE PROJECTS THAT WE FELT- AND A LOT OF AREAS IN RURAL CALIFORNIA NEVER SIDE BENEFIT. TO THE TAX CREDIT NAT IS ACTUALLY CHANGING APPRECIATE THAT RECORDING IF WE TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OF THE HIGHEST RATES PER CAPITA PROPERTY- AND- CHALLENGES WITH BUSINESS STARTS IS IN RURAL CALIFORNIA AND WHAT I APPRECIATE FROM THE INDUSTRY. IS THAT IS BEING RACKED NOW- IN REPORTING IS COMING BACK TO US SO AT TEN TWENTY NINE TWENTY THANK YOU BECAUSE THAT WASN'TAN ISSUE THAT WE HAD LAST TIME- AND I APPRECIATE YOU DRESSING THAT THE INDUSTRY DRESSING THAT. WE ARE STARTING TO SEE INVESTMENT IN. ALL CORNERS OF THE STATE AND IT IS LIFTING ALL BOATS- THROUGHOUT- THE GOLDEN STATE IN RURAL AND URBAN COMMUNITIES IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT TURNED OVER TO YOU FOR THE CLOTHES YOU HAVE BIPARTISAN SUPPORT. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN THANK YOU- MY COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES- WE HAVE TO DO A BETTER JOB AND AS THIS BILL PROGRESSES- IT WILL- YOU KNOW IT'S IMPORTANT TO MOVE IT OUT OF THE SENATE GIVEN OUR DEADLINES AND TIMELINES. BUT I EXPECTED CAN YOU HAVE THAT CONVERSATION WHEN IT'S OVER IN THE ASSEMBLY SO I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS- AS BEEN SAID THIS IS A VITAL INDUSTRY FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE IMPACT ON- UNION JOBS IMPACT ON MIDDLE CLASS WORKERS AND THE IMPACT ON THE ECONOMY ARE ALL MARRIED IN MOVING THIS FORWARD AND SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FRIEND ABOUT. TEN POINT YOU KNOW GOOD DC CENTER STERN THANK YOU SO MUCH IT'S IMPORTANT THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS REALLY GOOD DISCUSSION BY COMMITTEE TODAY THANK YOU SO MUCH AND DRUGS AND THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER VICE CHAIR SARA WIENER. WE HAVE A MOTION FOR BY CENTER WINNER. MR NOW CAN YOU PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. MOTION IS. TO RULES. NINE TEN THAT THE MEASURE B. WE WERE. TO THE COMMITTEE APPROPRIATE. PURSUANT TO JOINT RULED POINT FIVE. SENATOR MCGUIRE HI. WHERE ARE YOU SENATOR NIELSEN. REFLECTED I. DEALS AND- A SENATOR DORADO. TWO HOURS AGO- YOU SENATOR HERTZBERG SENATOR WIENER. WINNER HI AT THE FOUR ZERO VOTE LAYS IN GERMAN FOR ZERO VOTE THAT BILL IS OUT WE'RE CLOSE IN THE ROOM THANK YOU SO MUCH I CAN PRETTY MUCH SAY TRAVELS HOME THANK YOU SO MUCH SOONER STERN THERE'S A GENTLEMAN WE GOT A DOUBLE HEADER A DOUBLE HEADER OF SENATOR WIENER HE'S GONNA BE PRESENTING SP TWO SEVENTY ONE- AND THEN HE'S ALSO BE PRESENTING SP THREE SEVENTY NINE- WE'RE GONNA TAKE A QUICK THIRTY SECOND BREAK AS- THE GOOD SENATOR FROM CENSUS GO SET UP. AND WE'LL GET STARTED HERE IN THIRTY SECONDS. ALL RIGHT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. WE ARE WELCOMING THE GOOD SENATOR FROM SAN FRANCISCO. AT TWO BILLS. ONE ON JURIES. AT THE SECOND. HE HAS BEEN WORKING ON. GOSH SINCE THE BEGINNING OF LAST YEAR- AND IT'S BACK HERE AT SB THREE SEVENTY NINE THE FIRST WE'RE GONNA BE HEARING. ON SB TWO SEVENTY ONE. SIR WE- HAVE BEEN NEAR SIR IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU THE FORESHORES. THANK YOU. MR CHAIRMAN. I CALLED SP TWO SEVEN ONE IS- IT'S A- AN EXPANSION. OF A BILL THAT I AUTHORED AND WAS SIGNED INTO LAW A FEW YEARS AGO SP FIVE NINETY TWO. ARE YOU MAY RECALL- THE S. P. FIVE EIGHT TWO. IT HAS TO DO WITH- HOW WE DEFINE OUR JURY POOL- THE PRACTICE IN CALIFORNIA AND BOTH STATE COURTS AND FEDERAL COURTS. HAVE BEEN THE SUMMONS JURY POOLS. USING THE VOTER ROLLS. AND DMV FILES. AND THAT IS- NOT EXPAND AND- IT LEAVES A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT OF SOMEONE DOESN'T HAVE A DRIVER'S LICENSE. IF SOMEONE IS A REGISTERED TO VOTE THEY WON'T GET CALLED FOR JURY DUTY. AND SO IN TERMS OF ECONOMIC DIVERSITY AND RACIAL DIVRSITY- IT REALLY MEANS THAT WE HAVE JURY POOLS THAT ARE NOT. FULLY REFLECTIVE OF THE COMMUNITY- AND SO WHEN WE PASSED SB FIVE NINETY TWO- WE- AUTHORIZED. THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD TO PROVIDE. TAXPAYER FILES- TO OUR COUNTY JURY COMMISSIONERS. SO THAT THE JURY POOL WILL INCLUDE THE ENTIRE TAXPAYER. DATABASE AND THAT'S HOW IT'S JUST A MUCH BROADER- CROSS SECTION OF THE COMMUNITY AND SO THAT WAS PASSED- AND THEN- LAST YEAR- THE FEDERAL COURTS CAME TO US AND SAID. WE WOULD LIKE TO ALSO EXPAND OUR JURY POOLS BYE ARE THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD TELLS US THE LEGISLATION IS REQUIRED. TO AUTHORIZE THE TRANSFER OF THAT DATA TO THE FEDERAL COURTS. AND SO THAT'S ONE OF THE TWO SEVENTY ONE IS IT SIMPLY EXPANDS SP FIVE NINETY TWO ALSO AUTHORIZED FRANCHISE TAX BOARD. TO PROVIDE DATA SUBJECT TO SOME PRETTY STRICT CONFIDENTIALITY- I'M PROTECTIVE MEASURES. I TO THE FEDERAL COURTS- AND SO THAT'S THE GIST OF THIS- BILL LIKE IF THEY WERE ALREADY DOING THIS NOW IN STATE COURT- AND IF HE MAKES ALL THE SENSE IN THE WORLD. FOR THE PURPOSE OF DOING I SHOULD NOTE. THAT IN EXPANDING OUR GROUP PULLS TO THE TAXPAYER DATABASE CALIFORNIA WAS NOT THE FIRST STATE TO DO THAT A NUMBER OF OTHER STATES ALREADY DO IT SO THIS IS. A PRACTICE THAT IS I'VE BEEN GROWING AND WE SHOULD. I CONTINUE TO PUSH FORWARD. FOR RESPECTFULLY ASK- I. UP WITH- TODAY WERE THE VERSION TODAY IF SENIOR JUDGE. ON THE U. S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA I WILL SAY WHEN I WAS A DEPUTY CITY ATTORNEY I APPEARED BEFORE JUDGE ALSUP- MANY MANY TIMES HE IS A TOUGH AND FAIR A JUDGE THE WALKING JUDGE ALSUP. AND THEN WE'LL ALSO HEAR FROM LIZ KNOW WHERE- THE DIRECTOR OF ROOM OPERATIONS FOR THE US DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU SO MUCH SENATOR WIENER LADIES AND GENTLEMAN COMMITTEE AND WE WANT TO REMIND YOU OF ANYONE LIKE A BETTER PARTICIPATE IN TODAY'S HEARING YOU CAN CALL THE TOLL FREE NUMBER WE WELCOME YOUR PARTICIPATION WE'RE GONNA PUT THAT. TOLL FREE NUMBER UP ON THE SCREEN WE DO WELCOME PARTICIPATION REMOTELY HERE TODAY. AT LADIES IN GERMAN AS CENTER WINNER HAD JUST STATED WE HAVE TWO INDIVIDUALS WHO WILL BE LEAD WITNESSES IN SUPPORT WE'RE GRATEFUL THAT JUDGE ALSUP IS WITH US HE'S A SENIOR DISTRICT JUDGE IN THE U. S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA. JUDGE WE WELCOME YOU TO COMMITTEE- AND WE WELCOME YOUR COMMENTS ON S. B. TWO SEVENTY ONE YOU'RE IN COMMITTEE. YOU ARE NOW LIVE JUDGE. OKAY THANK YOU AND- THANK YOU HELLO ME AT. TO BE THESE KIND. I DON'T HAVE A FEDERAL JUDGE SAN FRANCISCO FOR TWENTY TWO YEARS. TEN OF THOSE YEARS I WAS THE CHAIR OF OUR JURY COMMITTEE. WELL I WAS. WE HAVE BECOME VERY FAMILIAR WITH THIS- APART FROM JUST BEING A TRIAL JUDGE. AND RUNNING- JURY TRIALS. THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM IS THAT WE WANT TO HAVE THIS DEVOTION A JURY POOL AS WE CAN POSSIBLY GET METHODS FALLS A LITTLE BIT SHORT AND THE TRADITIONAL METHODS ARE BOLDER. REGISTRATION ROLES AS WELL AS THE N. B. RECORDS. THE PROBLEM IS THE PEOPLE OF COLOR. THE MOVE AROUND MORE FREQUENTLY THAN OTHERS AND THEREFORE THE ADDRESSES THAT THEY LEAVE BEHIND WITH B. AND B. FOR EXAMPLE BECOME OUT OF DATE SHOW THE WORLD OUR JURY SUMMONS GOES TO THAT ADDRESS IT- THEY'RE NO LONGER THERE. AND SO WE NEED THE MOST CURRENT ADDRESSES. THAT WE CAN GET. AND THE TAX. ROLLS FROM THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD WILL BE A TREMENDOUS- EDITION SO THAT WE CAN HAVE MORE UP TO DATE ADDRESSES FOR OUR JURY SUMMONS. THIS IS NOT OUR PROBLEM IS EXACTLY THE SAME PROBLEM THAT YOU HAD PREVIOUS WILL ADDRESS THAT WITH THE SP FIVE NINETY TWO. AND. REALLY ALL WE'RE ASKING IS THAT THE- THAT SAME CODE DO OF F. T. B. THE EX TO THE FEDERAL. FOR THE BETTER COURT CAN. COMBINE THAT DATA BASE WITH THE ONES THAT WERE ALREADY USING- FOR THIS CONCEPT AND WE- VERY MUCH ASKING YOUR FAVORABLE CONSIDERATION- S. B. TWO SEVENTY ONE THANK YOU JUDGE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TAKING THE TIME TO BE WITH THIS KNOW HOW BUSY YOU ARE IN YOR TESTIMONY MEANS A LOT THANK YOU SO MUCH JUDGING HAPPY NEW YEAR TO YOU PLACE IN GENERAL ANOTHER MOVING ON TO LOSE NO WHERE SHE'S THE DIRECTOR OF COURTROOM OPERATIONS FOR THE U. S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA. IS NOT WHERE WE WELCOME YOU TO COMMITTEE RIGHT NOW LIVE YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES AND I'LL GIVE YOU A THIRTY SECOND PROMPT. IS NOT WHERE THE FLOOR IS YOURS. THANK YOU CHAIR AND MEMBERS. AND B. TWO SEVENTY ONE GOING TO BENEFIT THE STATE BY MAKING A FEDERAL JURY MORE CLOSELY REPRESENT THE INCREDIBLE DIVERSITY OF THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES WHICH- I'LL JUST BUILD BRIEFLY ON THE POINT. THE JUDGE OUT THAT THAT THAT. PROFESSOR SAM SUMMERS UP HEALTH UNIVERSITY FOUND IN A TWO THOUSAND SIX RESEARCH STUDY THAT RACIALLY DIVERSE JURY RAISED A BROADER RANGE OF QUESTIONS AND. MADE FEWER FACTUAL ERRORS. AND MEDIC MANY YOUR ALL LEADERSHIP- TO DIVERSIFYING JERRY WHEN HIS COURT ADDED TO D. AND E. LET YOUR ORIGINAL VOTER. REGISTRATION FIRST LEFT. BACK IN THE EARLY NINETIES WE SAW AN IMMEDIATE IMPROVEMENT IN THE REPRESENTATION OF BLACKS LATINOS AND ASIAN AMERICANS AND ARE QUALIFIED JURY POOL. WE RECENTLY HAD EXPERTS FROM THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR JURY STUDIES ANALYZE THEIR JURY POOL AND THEY FOUND THAT INCLUSION OF ANOTHER SOURCE LIST WOULD BRING THE COURT EVEN CLOSER TO ITS GOAL AND REFLECTING THE COMMUNITY. WHICH IN TURN INCREASES PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN VERDICTS RENDERED BY OUR FEDERAL OR CALIFORNIA FEDERAL JURY. YEAH DOWN THE DETAILS OF THE ALLEGED TAX FILERS FROM THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD IT'S GOING TO BE INCREDIBLY HELPFUL- IN ADDING INDIVIDUALS WHO NEITHER ARE REGISTERED TO VOTE NOR HAVE THE AMBULANCE BUT ALSO IF YOU SPENT. IN GETTING UP FRENCH YOUR ADDRESS ALMOST 20% OF THE SUMMONSES THAT OUR COURT AND THAT ARE RETURNED UNDELIVERABLE BY THE POST OFFICE.

AND HE BRINGS BACK AN AMENDED BILL HERE FOR S. B. THREE SEVENTY NINE- FOR ENTERTAINMENT BY THIS COMMITTEE HI SIR WHENEVER INTERNAL READY. AT I THANK YOU VERY MUCH I MISTER CHAIRMAN- SO- SP THREE SEVEN NINE IS SIMILAR TO A BILL THAT. WAS BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE LAST YEAR- SP SIX ONE SEVEN- IT DOES NOT CONTAIN THE FUNDING PEACE ANYMORE BECAUSE THAT WAS PLACED IN THE BUDGET. LAST YEAR GRANT PROGRAM FOR CITIES TO HELP THEM. IMPLEMENT OUR AUTOMATED- AUTOMATED- SOLAR- PERMITTING. I DO WANT TO NOTE THAT THERE IS A SUGGESTED AMENDMENT IN THE ANALYSIS- WERE WE'RE GOING TO. I BELIEVE THE ACCEPTING THAT A MOMENT INDIGENOUS VERY. ARE INVESTING IN THE ENERGY COMMITTEE. ARE THERE WAS ENOUGH TIME TO GET IN IN THIS COMMITTEE- SO COLLEAGUES SP THREE SEVENTY NINE- REQUIRES- JURISDICTION. ABOVE A CERTAIN SIZE- TO IMPLEMENT AUTOMATED ONLINE SOLAR PERMITTING PROCESS HE'S- FOR SIMPLE RESIDENTIAL ROOFTOP. SOLAR AND SOLAR PLUS STORAGE SYSTEMS I JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE. THAT THIS IS ABOUT. SOLAR STORAGE SYSTEMS ON RESIDENTIAL. ROOFTOPS ISN'T ABOUT LARGER. OR MORE COMPLICATED SYSTEMS IT'S NOT ABOUT. A BIG APARTMENT BUILDINGS IT'S NOT ABOUT COMMERCIAL. THIS IS REALLY FOR SMALL SINGLE FAMILY DUPLEX. A ROOFTOP SYMBOL OUR SOLAR SYSTEM THE KIND OF. BEEN GETTING INSTALLED IN CALIFORNIA. ART. FOR DECADES- SO ARE WE SO IS A CRITICAL OF. FUTURE INCOME IN TERMS OF MEETING OUR CLIMATE GOALS- AND WE HAVE ADOPTED ALL SORTS OF POLICIES IN CALIFORNIA TO ENCOURAGE- SOLAR AND ROOFTOP SOLAR- AND WE KNOW THE COST OF SOLAR HAS BEEN GOING DOWN MAKING IT ACCESSIBLE TO MORE MORE PEOPLE- THAT'S THE HARD COSTS. UNFORTUNATELY THE SOFT COSTS AND HAVE NOT BEEN GOING DOWN NEARLY SO MUCH I'M PART OF THE SOFT COSTS IS THAT THE PERMITTING TIME PERIOD. CAN SOMETIMES BE WEEKS OR EVEN MONTHS AND SOMETIMES THE SYSTEM IS INSTALLED IT SO SIMPLE SYSTEM- THAT WILL BE PERMITTED BUT IT CAN'T BE TURNED ON FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME IT'S- IT'S REALLY UNNECESSARY. A BARRIER- SO AUTOMATED- SOLAR PERMITTING IT'S SOMETHING I HAVE BEEN PIONEERED FRANKLY BY THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY- AND SECRETARY GROUND HOME HAS BEEN A REAL CHAMPION FOR THIS- THE U. THE- DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY- CREATED. SOMETHING CALLED SOUL SOLAR OUT PLUS WHICH WAS CREATED AS PART OF A VERY BROAD STAKEHOLDER PROCESS- AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL ON THIS BILL DOESN'T REQUIRE THE USE THAT CITIES ADOPT. SOLAR APP PLUS YOU CAN BE AT ANY KIND OF SIMILAR- BUT WE EXPECTED SOLAR PLUS WILL BE THE ONE THAT CITIES WILL USE BECAUSE IT'S A- WAS. PUT TOGETHER IN A VERY THOUGHTFUL- AND SOLID WAY- AND THIS WILL- ALLOW FOR FASTER A PERMITTING WE KNOW THE LOS ANGELES. AND SAN JOSE AND STOCKED IN OTHER CITIES ARE ALREADY- ALLOWING- AUTOMATED ONLINE SOLAR PERMITTING- AND THIS WILL EXPAND THAT TO THE REST OF THE STATE EXEMPTING OUT THE SMALLER CITIES AND COUNTIES. AND THEN ALSO PROVIDING A TIME FOR WOMAN TO- FOR CITIES THAT ARE IN. BUT ARE ON THE SMALLER. SIDE THIS IS FOR A PLUS IT'S FREE AND IT'S OPEN SOURCE IT'S EASY TO IMPLEMENT- THIS IS REALLY A VERY POSITIVE STEP IN TERMS OF THE SORT OF PUSHING OUR STATE. TO MOVE IN THAT DIRECTION- CITIES WILL STILL BE ABLE TO DO INSPECTIONS- IF THEY WANT TO ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS IT'S NOT. UPPER CLOSED WE DID WORK LAST YEAR WITH THIS COMMITTEE ON AMENDMENTS WHICH ARE CONTINUE TO BE INCLUDED IN THIS BILL WE ALSO WORK LAST YEAR WITH IBEW. AND CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS ON AMENDMENTS TO CAUSE THEM TO REMOVE THEIR OPPOSITION THOSE AMENDMENTS ARE STILL IN THIS BILL IN TOTAL- ANSWER CALLING THIS IS A GOOD BILL WHOSE TIME HAS COME.

DOING YEAH PLEASE FIRE AWAY. OKAY I'M SUPPORTING THE BILL AND- LET YOU KNOW. BUT CAN YOU TAKE A MINUTE AND IF IT TAKES LONGER TAN THAT WE CAN DO IT OFFLINE- JUST TO. EXPLAIN WHAT WOULD BE THE DIFFERENCE FOR THE ACTUAL. HOMEOWNER RESIDENT. THE CHANGE TO THIS. YEAH THE SYSTEM UP YOU KNOW AS CONSUMERS WHAT DO THEY LOOK FORWARD TO. PRICE CHANGES. IT'LL IT'LL JUST BE. FASTER THE RIGHT NOW. IF YOU- YOU'RE WORKING WITH A VENDOR AND THEY COME AND INSTALL. THE SYSTEM- THE- RIGHT NOW THEY CAN TAKE. IF YOU'RE LUCKY IT TAKES A FEW DAYS. TO GET A PERMIT- IT MIGHT TAKE WEEKS OR MONTHS UNFORTUNATELY I MEAN YOU'RE JUST SITTING THERE WITH THE SYSTEM BUT YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED. TO TURN ON IT'S VERY FRUSTRATING FOR THE CONSUMER- AND IN FACT- THE WE WERE TOLD THAT. THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO WALKED AWAY FROM EVEN DOING IT IF THEY THINK IT'S GOING TO TAKE A LONG TIME. THIS WILL ALLOW IT TO BE ESSENTIALLY INSTANTANEOUS UNLESS THERE'S SOME ISSUE. THAT CAUSES THE CITY TO WANT TO DO AN INSPECTION- BUT IT WILL BE EFFECTIVELY INSTANTANEOUS ARE ON THE SAME DAY. SO FOR THE CONSUMER TO MUCH THAT'S FRUSTRATING- PROCESS- THERE ARE OTHER ISSUES LIKE SOMETIMES GETTING THE- PG&amp;E ERROR I CAN ONLY SPEAK TO PG&amp;E. TO ACTUALLY- DO THE INTERCONNECTION CAN ALSO TAKE. TIME BUT THIS IS THIS WILL REMOVE TIME FOR THE PERMITTING AND ELIMINATE THAT. SOURCE OF THE LION FRUSTRATION FOR THE SIMPLE. SOLAR AND STORAGE SYSTEMS. RIGHT AND THAT'S BECAUSE THEY WILL BE. RIGHT REMOTELY OR BY VIDEOTAPE THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT A HOMEOWNER WILL BE. YOU CAN JUST EXPLAIN THAT PART OF THE S. OF A THE CONTRACTOR WOULD BE THE ONE TO DO IT WOULD BE ABLE TO GO TEST ONLINE AND JUST GET THE PERMIT- ONLINE- INSTEAD OF HAVING TO AUTOMATICALLY GO THROUGH THE PROCESS AGAIN CITY STILL HAVE SOME FLEXIBILITY. IF THEY THINK THAT THERE'S A PARTICULAR ISSUE THAT THEY NEED TO DO AN INSPECTION- THEY CAN DO THAT BUT IT WON'T BE AN AUTOMATIC THING THAT HAPPENS- EVERY EVERY TIME. AND ANY OTHER AND THE RATIONALE IS THAT FOR THE VERY SIMPLE SYSTEMS IT'S SORT OF LIKE IF YOU THINK BACK IN THE DAY WHEN DISHWASHERS WERE FIRST INVENTED- THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT OKAY WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE PLUGGING IT INTO THE PLUMBING SYSTEM OR WHAT I CREATE ISSUES. OBVIOUSLY TODAY WE DON'T REQUIRE EVEN REQUIRE A PERMIT FOR DOING THAT SO OVER TIME FOR THE SIMPLE SYSTEMS IT'S SUCH A ROUTINE THING AND IS THERE AREN'T SORT OF UNEXPECTED SURPRISES TYPICALLY PRETTY SIMPLE SYSTEMS NOT PROBABLY LIMITED ONLY TO RESIDENTIAL SMALL SIMPLE SYSTEM- AND SO THE AUTOMATION AUTOMATED PROGRAM WILL JUST MAKE A MUCH. SMOOTHER AND FASTER APPROVAL. NOTHING YOU SO MUCH VERY GRATEFUL SENATOR. THIS VENTURE ANY COMMENTS QUESTIONS OR PLEASE MR MOISTURE AUTHOR FROM BEING ONE OF THE BEST AUTHORS I'VE EVER KNOWN HE SO THOROUGHLY AND- I JUST DELIVERED A WORKING ON HIS LEGISLATION.

AND THEY'VE JUST ALMOST ALL PAST. BUT I'VE TALKED WITH SOME OF THE PROVIDERS SAYING YOU KNOW I'M GETTING TIRED OF YOU SEEKING YOUR OWN BENEFITS THAT YOU DON'T HELP OTHER FORMS OF ENERGY GENERATION LIKE CO GENERATION WHICH WE DESPERATELY NEED. PROTECTED FOR CLEANING UP OUR FORCES AND OUR WILD LANDS IN THE SOLAR INDUSTRY GREEDILY JUST TAKES CARE OF ITSELF AND DOESN'T WORRY ABOUT OTHER SOURCES OF POWER. AND I'M NOT NOT NOT OING TO SUPPORT ANYTHING MORE FOR SEWER UNTIL LIGHT INDUSTRY STEPS UP AND TRIES TO HELP US OUT IN OTHER AREAS OF ENERGY IN. CALIFORNIA AND THAT INCLUDES FOSSIL FUELS.
