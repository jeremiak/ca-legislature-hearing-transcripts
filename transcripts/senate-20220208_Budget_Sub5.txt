ALL ISSUES WILL BE HELD OPEN AND THERE WILL BE NO VOTES TAKEN TODAY. OKAY READY TO ROLL. THE FIRST ISSUE IS ISSUE ONE IS A CIVIL ASSESSMENT REDUCTION AND I BELIEVE FINANCE WILL BE PRESENTING. HI GOOD MORNING- MARC MINISTER ON THE FINANCE SO IN CONTINUATION ON IN CONTINUATION OF THIS ADMINISTRATION'S EFFORTS. TO PROVIDE FINANCIAL RELIEF FOR INDIVIDUALS- FROM THE POSITION OF FINES AND FEES WITHOUT BUDGET INCLUDES STATUTORY CHANGES TO REDUCE OF LOS ASSESSMENT THE SPY HOUSE FROM THE MAXIMUM OF THREE HUNDRED TO. ONE HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS- THE CIVIL ASSESSMENTS IT'S A TOOL USED BY THE STATE AND COURTS TO HOLD INDIVIDUALS ACCOUNTABLE WHEN THEY FAIL TO APPEAR ON THE COURT PROCEEDINGS ARE PAY A FINE BOB WE RECOGNIZE THE CURRENCY IS TOO HIGH AND CAN BE REDUCED TO HELP ALL CALIFORNIANS. ON THE BUDGET ALSO INCLUDES THREE MILLION ONGOING GENERAL FUND TO BACK FILL THE RESULTING LOSS IN SIMPLE STEPS AND REVENUES FOR TRUCK WORKS. ON LAST WEEK LASTLY WE- WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS PROPOSAL TO REDUCE THE BALL SUSSMAN BUILDS UPON FINDING IT REFORM EFFORTS TAKEN BY TAKEN BY THE ADMINISTRATION- INCLUDING THE ELIMINATION OF VARIOUS ADMINISTRATIVE FEES FOR CRIMINAL OFFENSES ALL OF THE EXPANSION OF THE ABILITY TO PAY PROGRAM THAT ALLOW LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS TO REDUCE FINES AND FEES FROM TRAFFIC AND NON TRAFFIC INFRACTIONS ACCORDING TO THEIR ABILITY TO PAY. HAPPY. TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF VALUE OFFICE. ANY WITH THE LEAD ANALYST'S WE HAVE CONCERN AGAINST THANK YOU. OKAY I HAVE A COUPLE OF A FEW QUICK AND THEN I'LL OPEN UP TO OUR COLLEAGUES HERE- JUST TO GET SOME BACKGROUND AS TO HOW THE ADMINISTRATION CAME TO SETTLE ON THE REDUCTION OF A HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS ARE VERSUS OTHER REDUCTIONS OR ELIMINATION ALTOGETHER. SO- HI AGAIN MARTIN IS A PERMANENT FINANCED- SO WOULD BE- ADMINISTRATION CONSIDER DIFFERENT ALTERNATIVES WHEN IT COMES TO THE PRODUCTION OF THE CYSTS CIVIL ASSESSMENT HOWEVER WE FEEL THAT. THE PERCENT REDUCTION STRIKES A BALANCE OF PROVIDING MEDIA FISCAL RELIEF FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS AND ALSO PRESERVING THE VIABILITY OF THE SURPLUS AND BEING USED AS A TOOL TO KEEP INDIVIDUALS ACCOUNTABLE TO COMPEL INDIVIDUALS. APPEAR IN COURT PROCEEDINGS AND ENGAGE THEIR FINES I'M JUST NOT THAT ANY FURTHER EXPANSION OF COURSE WILL WORK BY YOUR- ADDITIONAL GENERAL FUND BACKED BILLS SO- WE SETTLED ON. THE PERCENT. ACCESS CONSISTENT WITH. THAT WE SUBMITTED LAST YEAR AS WELL TO REDUCE SYSTEM BY PERCENT. I KNOW WE HAVE A TAKEN UP IN THE PAST- UN NOT ONLY A PROSPECT BUT- OF- THAT- DID YOU LOOK AT THAT CONCERT THAT- DID OWED. AND ALSO- WHAT OTHER- WAYS HAVE YOU THOUGHT OF AS FAR AS- YOU KNOW HELPING PEOPLE YOU KNOW. IT'S GETTING PEOPLE OF THEM. YOU KNOW FEELING THE COMPELLED TO APPEAR- BUT NOT SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE SO BURDENSOME TO ESPECIALLY POOR PEOPLE. I'M SURE SO- B. AS- A THAT AS YOU'RE AWARE ON THE CIVIL SYSTEM DOESN'T YOU BUT AS A TOOL TO COMPEL INDIVIDUALS- TO A APPEAR IN COURT- YOU KNOW HI. THIS IS CERTAINLY AN ALTERNATIVE TO ON BENCH WARRANTS WHICH IS A POLICY THAT ADDED MINISTRATION BUTTON- WHAT I WANT- THE COURTS TO- TO TAKE IF WE WERE TO ELIMINATE THE AND- I SIMPLE ASSESSMENT SO- WE DETERMINED THAT- THE SIMPLE ASSESSMENT. WOULD CERTAINLY BE A VIABLE TOOL TO KEEP INDIVIDUALS ACCOUNTABLE- WHILE PREVENTING AND THE POLICY- TO ISSUE BENCH WARRANTS TO COMPEL INDIVIDUALS- BUT ALSO REDUCE TACTIC IMPACT THEM- YOU KNOW- THE- FIVE. REDUCING THE FEES BUT THEN SO YOU KNOW MAKING SURE THAT THERE IS A THEM TO OF THE TWO- OKAY WELL I DEFINITELY A PRE THAT WERE ADDRESSING THIS AND BE SHE TO F. ON WILL KEEP ON WITH THE CONVERSATION COLLEAGUES ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS CENTER CRITICIZING. SO THANK YOU MEASURE- JUST LISTENING HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS IT'S HUNDRED COMMON I'M I'M NOT SURE THAT- THE JUXTAPOSITION OF A BENCH WARRANTS VERSUS A SIMPLE ASSESSMENT FEES IS REALLY APPROPRIATE BECAUSE OF THE FACT MATTER IS WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE RATIONALE HERE TO. THE HELP LOW INCOME CALIFORNIA'S PARTICULARLY PEOPLE OF COLOR IF THEY DON'T HAVE THE MONEY- I THINK THAT'S WHERE THE LOW INCOME PIECE OF THIS IS COMING FROM THAT HOUSE AT ANY INCENTIVE. TO COME IN YOU EITHER HAVE IT OR YOU DON'T I MEAN THERE'S ALWAYS AN ARGUMENT NOT THAT I'M PRO BENCH WARRANTS BUT THERE'S A REASON ARGUMENT THAT- YOU KNOW BECOMING WITHOUT THE CIVIL ASSESSMENT FEE BECAUSE YOU'RE MANDATED TO COME IN- YOU'RE BETTER OFF ECONOMICALLY INTO SOMEBODY ALREADY YOU CAN STILL BUY GROCERIES OR YOU ARE TAKING MONEY OUT OF POCKET YOU'RE FAMILY AND YOU'RE NOT. HAVING SOMEBODY COME AFTER YOU FOR COLLECTIONS LATER ON SO AGAINST THE REAL QUESTION I HAVE IS OR THE- PERSONALS A PROGRAM EFFECTIVE AT ALL PRESUMABLY. THE EFFECTIVENESS IS LIMITED IN THE EQUITY OF IT ALL IS LIMITED OTHERWISE WE WOULDN'T BE REDUCING- THE FI HERO IN HALF IN THE FIRST PLACE. BUT THEN. IT'S ME BY SLIDING THE FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS OVER. TO ESSENTIALLY GENERAL FUND SUBSIDY OF THE COURTS- IT JUST STRIKES ME THAT IT'S AT SOME POINT WE JUST NEED TO RESTRUCTURE HOW WE'RE DOING THIS COMPLETELY- IT'S JUST KIND OF ROBBING PETER TO PAY PAUL AT THIS POINT- I'D LIKE THE TO THE WHAT I WOULD CALL THE TEMPORARY OUTCOME OF REDUCED FEES. BUT MAYBE WE OUGHT TO BE SORT OF RIPPING THE BAND AID OFF HERE AND JUST SAYING THAT THE FEES ARE- NOT HELPFUL WE NEED TO ELIMINATE THEM IN IN HEALTH. YOU KNOW JUST TO PUT UP A POLICY DECISION TO BE REDUCING THEM IN SUCH AS DEALING WITH THIS IS A ONE OFF THIS YEAR BUT HAVING A FIVE YEAR PLAN FOR EXAMPLE TO JUST PLEASE AMOUNTS- THOSE REPORTS THAT I TELL OF. THEM HAD WAITED. MMHM WE ALREADY HEARD ABOUT. THANK YOU SEE MINISTRATIONS OF RESIDUAL COUNCIL'S POINT OF VIEW ON BENCH WARRANTS VERSUS FEES BUT- IT IS OR HASN'T BEEN THOUGHT ABOUT. MORE THOUGHT THERE ABOUT WHAT THE FEES ARE WOULD LOOK LIKE ON THIS REVIEW SAID IS THAT THE OVERALL IDEA OF. I DID THE- OVERALL IDEAS NECESSARILY TENTATIVELY SET UP THIS TIME- IT SO IT'S THE CERTAINLY MINISTRY BUT CONDITION BURKE BEST STUFF AND AS A TOOL TO A. I A TOOL TO COMPEL AND TO APPEAR COURT- I AM OUR SUBMITTED- CAN BE A GOVERNOR'S- I ALSO WANTED THAT WE ARE- IN THE PRE FISCAL YEAR- X. EXPAND B. AND- ABILITY TO PAY PER- TO ASSIST LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS- TO. DRAW DOWN OR TO REDUCE THEIR OTHER NAY. OR I'M- FINANCING FEES THAT THEY MIGHT BE FACING ACCORDING TO THEIR ABILITY TO PAY SO THAT'S CERTAINLY PART OF. YOU KNOW PART OF OVERALL I BY THE POLICY EVERY BEEN CA- IN ADDITION TO THAT THE REDUCTION OF THE SIMPLE STUFF THAT. FIVE I HAD I DID NOT SEE THAT IF IT'S HERE IN THE PACKET COMMITTEE MADE A- DECISION ON THAT WITH REGARD TO THE ABILITY TO PAY PROGRAM THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE- HAVE ALREADY- THAT WAS INCLUDED IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET- IT'S THAT THAT'S ALREADY IN. IT IN STATUTE. IF WE CAN GET THAT INFORMATION- BETWEEN NOW AND WHEN WE PICTURE COULD NOT BE HELPFUL JUST AS- ADDITIONAL CONTEXT BECAUSE- FOR ME WHEN I WHEN I SAY WE I. AND I'M ASKING ON THE OF THE COMMITTEE MANAGER THAT'S OF. BUT THE- THE EV'S IN THE I HAVE- JUST NOW. IN IN EXCHANGE FOR GIVE RID OF WHICH IS- ALSO WE HELPING WITH THIS OF WHICH IS YOU KNOW PUTTING THIS IN HALF ACROSS THE BOARD IS IT JUST LOW INCOME PERSONS OF COLOR WE HELPING. YOU KNOW A BUNCH OF FOLKS WHO COULD AFFORD TO PAY THE FEES- AND I THINK YOU TO START OF THE ANSWER THAT QUESTION I DON'T NEED YOU TO. VERBALIZE ANYMORE BUT IF YOU COULD GIVE US AS A REFRESHER LAST YEAR'S OF- EAT. ADOPTION THAT THAT WOULD BE THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO ME FROM. JUST BY THE MANAGER WITH BUILT I'D LIKE TO DISCUSS FLAG THIS. FOR NO OTHER REASON THAT I THINK FROM A POLICY STANDPOINT AS WE GET TOWARD THE END OF THE BUDGET PROCESS I DO THINK LEGISLATIVELY- WE COULD IF THAT'S OUR- DISPOSITION- YOU KNOW TALK ABOUT UP SOME KIND OF A FULL PHASE OUT OVER TIME. IS HAVE THAT DISCUSS OF THE TO AND OF HOW PEOPLE REALLY FEEL ABOUT THESE FEES EXISTING AT ALL I KNOW. IN MY OWN COUNTY A FEW YEARS AGO WE COMPLETELY ELIMINATED THEM- FOR CERTAIN AGE GROUPS AND CATEGORIES OF PEOPLE. THAT BECAUSE IT JUST WASN'T WORKING- SERVICE SO I JUST I THINK THERE'S A POLICY QUESTION COMPETITORS TO WHERE WE WANT TO KEEP GOING WITH IT YEP. THAT'S ALL THANK YOU VERY MUCH SO WITH REGARDS TO THE FURTHER INFORMATION. YEAH THAT WAS ON I WAS ON THE FURTHER INFORMATION ON WHICH IS ASKING FOR- ALWAYS EMBARRASSING TO SAY THIS I GUESS BUT I WAS JUST ASKING FOR- FOR THIS. TO BE SUBMITTED TO US WHAT WE ADOPTED LAST YEAR IN TERMS OF THE ABILITY TO PAY. PROGRAM AT. IF WE DEAL WITH SO MANY THINGS I JUST DON'T REMEMBER EXACTLY HOW THE STRUCTURE NEXT TO BE HELPFUL FORWARD. OKAY THANK YOU FOR BERMAN THERE BRIEFLY AND THEN YOU KNOW JUST LIKE I AGREE SENATE QUOTATION OF BUILDING A POINT YOU MADE TO EACH YOUR THE CALL PROPORTIONATE IS AN IMPORTANT PRINCIPLE WE SHOULD FIGURE OUT HOW TO BETTER APPLY THAT. BUT I THINK IT'S ALSO TRUE THAT DID THAT WE SHOULDN'T WE SHOULD BE CAREFUL THAT WE'RE NOT FUNDING THE JUDGES THE JUSTICE SYSTEM THREE CITATIONS RIGHT NOT THE PHRASE I'VE HEARD. TAXATION BY STATE CITATION. BECAUSE TO THE EXTENT THAT THE SYSTEM RELIES ON FINE SHE CREATES PERVERSE INCENTIVES. AT A MINIMUM NOT TO LOOK AT- TRIPS YOU KNOW THE POSSIBILITY OF FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES. AND SO THERE'S A NOTE IN OUR ANALYSIS HERE THAT THAT SAYS ACCORDING TO A SURVEY OF THE DEBT FREE. JUSTICE CALIFORNIA COALITION 73% OF CALIFORNIA'S WITH TRAFFIC INFRACTIONS DID NOT EVEN KNOW THERE WAS A FEAT FOR MISSING A DEADLINE. TO PAY APPEARED CORDIAL. YOU KNOW I WOULD ARGUE THAT'S PROBABLY NOT THEIR FAULT THAT'S OUR FAULT- AND TO THE EXTENT WE DON'T. TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT AND IT ALSO NOTES THAT. THE USE OF KIND OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES LIKE TEXT REMINDERS AN OPERATOR ALSO SUCCESSFUL AYE I WOULD POINT OUT THESE TWO THINGS ARE MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE. JAMES COMEY YOU COULD POINT OUT TO PEOPLE VIA TEXT MESSAGE THAT YOU MIGHT WANT TO TAKE YOUR FINER THIS THE CONSEQUENCES BECOMES. MORE SEVERE- BUT AGAIN I MEAN I THINK AT SOME POINT WE HAVE TO REALLY LOOK HARD AT PROPORTIONALITY- BECAUSE THE LARGER GOALS REMAIN WHICH IS WHERE TO CREATE DISINCENTIVES- TO DO. NOT DOING CERTAIN THINGS APPROPRIATE PENALTIES FOR DOING THOSE THINGS. THAT YOU KNOW IT'S RIGHT I'D BE INTERESTED I GUESS IS THAT THAT'S A POLICY MATTER NOT A BUDGET MATTER. TO A LEAVE IT FOR NOW. OKAY THANK YOU SIR AND- BUT I. WHAT WE- YOU'RE- MISTER HUMAN. IS SON- MISLI. IS THAT WE COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH. TO THIS ISSUE. AND NOT. A SYSTEM THAT RELIES ON IN. GREAT PART ON POOR PEOPLE. TO PAY FOR- SO IT WOULD BE GOOD TO GET THE INFORMATION THAT WAS REQUESTED BY SENATOR CORTEZ THE- BUT ALSO. GIVE A LITTLE BIT MORE COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH RATHER THAN. LET'S TRY THIS ONE YEAR AND- AND WE ALREADY KNOW WHAT THE ALT SOME ALTERNATIVES ARE. AND LET'S BE MORE COMPREHENSIVE. THANK YOU ANY MORE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. NO OKAY WE MOVE ONE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR MENACE- MOVE ON TO COURT OF FUNDING ON THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL WILL PRESENT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS MY NAME IS JOHN WORK LAW I'M THE CHIEF ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICER YOU'RE THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS YOU TODAY ON THIS IMPORTANT. PROPOSAL FROM THE GOVERNOR OF THE CHIEF JUSTICE FOR COUNSEL AND THE COURT TURNED STRONG SUPPORTER OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET WE ARE GRATEFUL TO THE GOVERNOR FOR RECOGNIZING OUR LONG STANDING STRUCTURAL FUNDING GAPS AND- HOUSE PROPOSED WOULD GO A LONG WAY TO HELPING OUT THE COURTS. FIRST ISSUE IS OUR FOR- THAT WOULD BE A HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS ON GOING. FOR THE PURPOSE OF- CREATING EQUITY AMONGST THE COURTS AS YOU KNOW THE COURTS HAVE LONG STRUGGLED- FINANCIALLY WITH RUNNING THEIR COURTS AND ON THIS MONEY WOULD DO. A GREAT DEAL TO HELP THE COURTS TO STABILIZE SERVICE HOURS AND DAYS COURTS ARE OPEN TO THE PUBLIC- WHEN IMPROVE EMPLOYEE RETENTION RATES FIRE- RESTORING AND INCREASING STAFFING LEVELS. I WOULD IMPROVE SERVICE DELIVERY- BY REDUCING WEIGHT AND CASE PROCESSING THE WASTE. WE HAVE A NUMBER OF COURTS THAT ARE. OUR LOWER FINDING CORKS- DAD'S ARE LUIS FUND COURT AT 73% OF ALL THE WORKLOAD AND- AS YOU KNOW MANY OF OUR LARGER COURTS LA FOR EXAMPLE IS OUR OUR OUR LARGEST COURT IN THE STATE IN THE NATION THAT MATTER YEAH IS IT SITTING AT JUST. BELOW 75% FUNDING FOR WORKLOADS ORANGE COUNTY IS THAT PERCENT. AND TULARE- ONE OR SMALLER COURTS SEVENTY SIX PERCENT- ALL IN GREAT NEED YELLOW IS OUR OUR OUR LOWEST FUNDING COURT ACT. 73% FIRST AVERAGE IS ALL RIGHT AROUND 80% BOB BROUGHT AND SO THIS ARE. MONEY WOULD GREAT OUT HELP THE COURT. OUR INTENT I THINK YOU'RE SO WERE THAT THESE DOLLARS TO GO TO THE FUNDING COURTS ON YOUR AGENDA MATT CHAIR. WE ASK HOW WITH BE ALEX OUT- I'D LIKE TO YOUR TO BACK IN JULY OF. TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE WHEN THE COUNCIL APPROVED THE BUDGET PROPOSAL MOVES FORWARD TO- STRETCHING FOR CONSIDERATION- IT ASK FOR EQUITY FUNDING AND YET- THE MASS IN WHICH WE WOULD ALLOCATE THOSE FUNDS WOULD BE TO THOSE COURTS AT THE LOWEST. FUNDING LEVEL STATEWIDE SO THAT SO THAT'S HOW THAT WOULD GO OUT OF THE NEXT ISSUE ON IN YOUR AGENDA MADAM CHAIR IS OUR REQUEST FOR CONSUMER PRICE ADJUSTMENT. THAT WOULD INCLUDE EIGHTY FOUR POINT TWO MILLION ONGOING AND RECOGNIZED- THE SECOND STRUCTURAL ISSUE WHICH IS ONGOING NEED FOR ADJUSTMENT IN OUR COST PRESSURES DUE TO INFLATION. BOB THE NEXT ISSUE ADDRESSES ARE JUDGESHIPS BOB THIS WOULD INCLUDE TWENTY THREE. FUNDING FOR THE REMAINING TWENTY THREE JUDGE SHIPS THAT WERE ORIGINALLY APPROVED BACK IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN YEAH AB ONE FIFTY NINE. AND SO THAT WOULD. BE MUCH NEEDED BY JUDGES SPOTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND THEN FINALLY- ADDRESSES ARE REVENUE BACK STILL NEEDS AS WE HAVE. CIVIL THREE AND FIND OUR REVENUE HAS BEEN INCREASING OVER THE YEARS IT WOULD CONTINUE I GENERAL FUND SUPPORT. OF THOSE. I MEAN GAPS. I AM MADAM BY- COURT LEADERSHIP WE- J. ZANER RAPPERS. OF THE TRIAL PRESIDE JUDGE AT FIVE CAN- AS WELL AS PRISON JUDGE OF SANTA CLARA WE HAVE KEVIN HARRIGAN COURT EXECUTIVE OFFICER FOR THE TAMA SUPERIOR COURT AND CHAIR OF OUR COURT EXECUTIVE ADVISORY COMMITTEE. WE HAVE JUDICIAL COUNCIL STAFF BOB ROB- YOUNG. HE'S OUR CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER AS WELL AS LOCKER. THEODORE RICH AVAILABLE HELLO AS OUR BUDGET EXPERT SHOULD CALLING YOU MADAM CHAIR OR MEMBERS. HAVE QUESTIONS FOR US. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER WARDLAW- WE WILL HAVE NOT MOVE ON FINANCE TO GET THE COMMENTS IN THEN WE MAY GO BACK FOR QUESTIONS THANK YOU. HI I'M ARGUMENT IS A PERMANENT FINANCE- JUST WANTED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT FUNDING TOWARDS LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES- AS LAID OUT IN THE AGENDA- WE JUST KNOW THAT THE FISCAL EQUITY FUNDING MAY BE USED- BY TRIAL COURTS TO ADDRESS BACKLOGS DELAYS FOR COURT USERS OR ADDRESSING PHYSICAL. THING FOR CORPORATIONS AND FURTHERMORE THE ADMINISTRATION BELIEVES IT IS CRITICAL TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL BRANCH FLEXIBILITY WITH HOW THIS RESOURCES ARE ALLOCATED AND WHAT THESE RESOURCE RESOURCES CAN BE USED FOR BECAUSE THE JUDICIAL BRANCH AS A SEPARATE BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT SHOULD HAVE DISCRETION ON HOW THESE. RESOURCES ARE ALLOCATED IN EACH PORT HAS DIFFERENT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED WITH RESPONDING- I CONCLUDE MY COMMENTS THANK YOU. THANK. YOU VERY MUCH MISLI. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND ANY WHAT THE LEGISLATURE OFFICE ON SO AS IN. BY VOTERS RIGHT OF THE OF FINANCE. WE DO HAVE COMMENTS FOR YOU SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO THE ONE HUNDRED MILLION TO PROMOTE FISCAL EQUITY- SPECIFICALLY WE DO RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE INSURE THAT THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING PROVIDED AS WELL AS HOW IT'S ALLOCATED SH REFLECTS LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES. SEVEN PROMOTING FISCAL EQUITY IS A IS A POLL WITH MERIT- AS IT PROMOTES EQUAL ACCESS TO JUSTICE ACROSS THE STATE. HOWEVER AT THIS POINT- IT'S CURRENTLY UNCLEAR EXACTLY HOW THE MONEY WOULD BE DISTRIBUTED AT THAT DECISION AS MUCH ADDITIONAL COUNSEL. WE WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT THERE ARE DIFFERENT WAYS OF PROMOTING TRUST FISCAL EQUITY WHICH CAN IMPACT OF THE NUMBER OF COURTS THAT RECEIVE FUNDING AS WELL AS HOW MUCH FUNDING A RECEIPT. SO GO BACK TO MISTER MOORE LOTS COMMENTS FOR EXAMPLE YOU KNOW ONE WAY OF DOING THAT IS TO TARGET THE COURTS THAT ARE BELOW THE STATEWIDE AVERAGE WHICH IS THE WAY THAT WE APPROACH IT IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. BUT ANOTHER WAY IS ALSO TO BRING- ALL COURTS UP TO A MINIMUM. KNESSET LEVEL. IN ADDITION TO THIS ALSO THAT THERE ARE OTHER PRIOR THAT COULD BECOMES. SHE WE ARE. YOU KNOW AT X. SOME OF THE- WERE TO THE PANDEMIC'S RELATED TO BACKLOG AND DELAYS IN COURT PROCEEDINGS AND SO THAT COULD BE AN AREA WHERE WE MIGHT WANT. TO MINIMIZE IMPACTS ON COURT COURT USERS AND THAT'S ADDRESSING EQUITY IN DIFFERENT WAY YOU KNOW EQUITY IN TERMS OF PUBLIC ACCESS AND HOW QUICKLY EACH CASE CAN BE RESOLVED. SO IN LINE WITH THIS ONE OPTION THAT THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER IS TO PROVIDE SOME OR ALL OF THE REQUESTED FUNDING IN THE BUDGET YEAR. TO ADDRESS PANDEMIC RELATED IMPACTS AND TO KIND OF HELP WITH THAT THE LEGISLATURE COULD ASK THE JUDICIAL BRANCH TO REPORT IN THE SPRING. TO BASICALLY IDENTIFY WHERE THE GREATEST NEEDS ARE AND THEN AFTER THE BUDGET YEAR THE FUNDS CAN BE ALLOCATED- YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE TO BRING ALL OF THE COURTS. TO AT LEAST EIGHTY FOUR POINT FIVE PERCENT. OF THE NEED WHICH IS WHAT YOU KNOW A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS POTENTIALLY COULD BRING THEM YEAH. SO WITH THAT WE'RE. HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOUNG. THANK YOU MISLI- COLLEAGUES. DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS SENATE QUARTERS YES. FRIEDMAN SURE- CUSHION FOR FINANCE ON THE ON THE- ON THE THREE POINT 8% THE INFLATIONARY ADJUSTMENT PHYSICIST PARTIBLE- LARGER- PLANNED FOR INFLATIONARY ADJUSTMENTS ACROSS DEPARTMENTS OBVIOUSLY IN THIS COMMITTEE- CHIEF JUDICIAL IS JUST IS JUST ONE AREA OF CONCERN WILL BE TAKEN UP CITIES CDCR TRANSPORTATION OTHER THINGS SO I'M JUST WONDERING IF WE SHOULD BE EXPECTING. A CONSISTENT THREE POINT 8% INFLATIONARY ADJUSTMENT COMING THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS THIS YEAR. OR IS THIS SOMETHING UNIQUE TO- THE JUDICIAL BRANCH AT THIS POINT- HELLO HI MARC BERMAN OF THE PERMANENT FINANCE AT. THIS RECALL THAT THREE POINT 8% ADJUSTMENT IS IT IS REALLY JUST SPECIFIC TOOK THE INITIAL COUNSEL ACCOUNT- ED CAN SPIT IT CERTAINLY NOT PART OF A BROADER STATEWIDE ADJUSTMENT- I'M NOT TO SAY THAT THERE THERE THERE CAN'T BE BUT THIS SPECIFIC PROPOSAL IS SPECIFICALLY FOR THE REPORTS. AMONG BIT CAN ABOUT- TO CENTER INTER AGENCY EQUITY IF YOU WILL FOR A BETTER WAY TO PUT A PIC MAYBE CURTI IS A BETTER WORD- IT AND ALSO KIND OF A ME TOO ATTITUDE I DON'T KNOW WHY IF IT'S IF IT'S TRULY AN INFLATIONARY ADJUSTMENT- NOBODY'S FAULT OTHER THAN THE FACT THAT WE HAVE INFLATION IN A THREE POINT 8% IS AN ACCURATE NUMBER. WHY WOULDN'T THAT APPLY TO THE COST OF BREAD FOR A PRISON INMATES SOME- HERE TRANSPORTATION PROJECT COSTS AND ALL KINDS OF OTHER THINGS SO. I'M I DON'T KNOW IF THE ILLEGAL HAS A COMMENT ON THAT BUT IF IT WAS THAT RAISED AT ALL IN THE ALEJO'S OFFICE SAID. BUT PERHAPS THERE SHOULD BE SOME CONCERN ABOUT THE PRESIDENT OF A UNIQUE INFLATIONARY ADJUSTMENT FOR ONE PARTICULAR- PIECE OF THE BUDGET UNDER ISSUE ON THIS ISSUE- THE JUDICIAL BRANCH IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT FROM SOME OF THE OTHER DEPARTMENTS SO WHEN YOU CONSIDER DEPARTMENTS LIKE CITY C. R. THE LEGISLATURE DOES APPROVED- AND WILL USE AGREEMENTS RELATED TO SALARIES- AND THEIR OTHER DISCUSSIONS RELATED TO THAT TO THEIR BUDGET. ON THE COURT SIDE- WHILE THERE WAS A TRIAL COURT REALIGNMENT- SHIFTING RESPONSIBILITY OF THE COURTS TO THE STATE- COURT EMPLOYEES OR COURT EMPLOYEES THERE AND THEY'RE NOT- WE DON'T THAT THE LEGISLATURE DOES NOT APPROVE ADULT ADULT USE IN THE SAME WAY AND SO- AS PART OF THE BUDGET SOMETIMES BUT DEPARTMENT FINANCE WILL PROVIDE AN UNALLOCATED AUGMENTATION- AND THEN SOMETIMES LIKE IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET THEY WILL PROVIDE A SPECIFIC PERCENTAGE AMOUNTS AND SO THAT'S WHAT YOU SEE BEFORE YOU I DON'T KNOW IF THAT PROVIDE HELPFUL CONTEXT. WILL IT IT DOES IT RAISES THE QUESTION ARE YOU SAYING THAT THESE DISINFLATIONARY JUST MINUTES FOR PERSONNEL COSTS. A PAYROLL BENEFITS- PERS OR I DON'T UNDERSTAND I YOU EXAM OF YOU KNOW THE CALL OF A LOAF OF BREAD FOR PRISON INMATES I KNOW A CAN'T KEEP TRACK OF EVERYTHING BUT I MY OWN COUNTY- THE NEWS TWO DAYS AGO WAS SAID THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS HAS TO COME UP WITH A MILLION AND A HALF DOLLARS FOR INFLATIONARY ADJUSTMENT. FOR THE JAIL SYSTEM THERE- BIG COUNTY BIG JAIL SYSTEM- SO OBVIOUSLY THERE IS INFLATIONARY PRESSURES. BEYOND JUST. PERSONNEL I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND ABOUT REALIGNMENT IT FORTUNATELY OR UNFORTUNATELY HAVE BEEN IN OFFICE LONG ENOUGH TO HAVE LIVED THROUGH THAT MYSELF BUT- I GUESS I WAS JUST ASKING THE QUESTION OF IT IS A THREE POINT 8% BASED ON SOME INDEX THAT WE SHOULD BE EXPECTING OTHER FOLKS. TO BE TO BE USING OR OR LOOKING AT IN TERMS OF THE COST OF CARE OF ITS COLLECTIVE BARGAINING RELATED OR NOT IT'S IT SEEMS TO ME OR MO YOU RELATED THAT. YOU'RE ESTABLISHING. RIGHT HERE AT THE FOR END OF THIS BUDGET PROCESS IN THIS COMMITTEE- THREE POINT INFORMATION ORIGINAL SPENT. MAKE A KNOWLEDGE THAT THREE POINT EIGHT- SOME COMMENT ON THAT THREE POINT EIGHT- IT WAS YEAH IT WAS DETERMINED BY. THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AT THE TIME BUT OF COURSE THAT YOU KNOW- THE RATES HE'S ASKED THAT WAS JUST AN ESTIMATE AT THAT TIME AND- RATE CERTAINLY CHANGE AS MORE DATA INSTANCE THAT. IS SINCE THE CHOIR- AND WITH REGARDS TO THE TO BE- HOW THE FUNDS. ARE USED- THE- P. THREE EIGHT- AMOUNT. IS JUST OPERATIONS FOR OF COURSE CAN USE ABSTAINED TO- MAYBE THAT- JUST COUNCIL CAN PROVIDE EXAMPLES OF HOW BETTER COURTS HAVE USED TO STUFF THE PAST. SEVENTY ALL. IF THERE BEEN A PLEASURE ADJUSTMENTS RECENTLY IN THE JITTERS ACCOUNTS WERE ORDERED ONE OF THE- THE PRESIDING JUDGES WANTS TO. WAS IT DOES TAKE A DEEPER DIVE AND TELLS HOW THE TYPICALLY USE THE MONEY I THINK MAYBE ONE MINUTE ARE ON THAT I WANT TO TAKE UP ALL THE COMMITTEES TIME PURCHASE HEARING ISSUES FOR. EIGHT BY THE WAY I'M HOME I UNDERSTAND WE NEED INFLATIONARY ADJUSTMENTS RIGHT NOW I'M NOT FIGHTING THE IDEA OF AN INFLATION ADJUSTMENT I'M NOT EVEN FIGHTING THE IDEA OF THE GOING TO PERSONNEL I'M JUST. MORE CONCERNED ABOUT. SORT OF A ME TOO ATTITUDE THROUGHOUT THE ORGANIZATION OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA MR WARD LINE WOULD YOU LIKE TO RESPOND. THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR CALL I APPRECIATE YOUR INTEREST AND- I WOULD INVITE KEVIN HARRIGAN OUR CORE EXECUTIVE OFFICER AS WELL AS- ALEXANDER I WAS TO SPECIFICALLY HOW COURTS UTILIZE THESE FINDINGS ARE DIRECTLY IN THE COURTS. THANK YOU FOR THAT JOHN AND IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE WITH THE COMMITTEE THIS MORNING MY NAME'S KEVIN HARRIGAN ACCORDING SECOND OF OFFICER TO HIM COURT AND CURRENT CHAIR OF THE COURT EXECUTIVES ADVISORY COMMITTEE AND- BY. THE USE OF INFLATIONARY MONIES IS KIND OF AN ALL OF THE ABOVE HI- NEED AND IT DEPENDS ON EACH COUNTIES NEED BUT GENERALLY I WOULD GO TO COST- INCREASES RELATED TO WAGES OR CONTRACT COSTS- IN JANITORIAL IS A EXAMPLE AND SO IT WOULD BE AN ACROSS THE BOARD- OPERATION AS AS TIME PROGRESSES. SO HAPPY TO PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION YOU YOU MENTIONED THAT A QUICK MINUTE AND SO I'M HAPPY TO ASK ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS BUT GENERALLY IT'S ALL COST PRESSURES THAT HAVE TO BE ACKNOWLEDGED SHORT OF FUNDING THAT WOULD BE KIND OF CONSIDERED A- POSSIBLE DECREASE S. AS THAT WOULD ALL THE WAY AT. THE FUNDING THAT'S CURRENTLY AVAILABLE. THANK THANK YOU KNOW THAT WAS A PERFECT QUICK MINUTE AND I APPRECIATE IN THE BREEZE A CONCERN AND- I UNDERSTAND THE ANSWER- I HAVE ONE OTHER QUESTION MANAGER AND HAS TO DO SOMETHING ENTIRELY DIFFERENT. ON ON THIS. IN THIS SECTION- AND THEN HAS TO DO WITH- THE BACKLOG ISSUE- BUT I NOTE IN- IN THE. IN MY NOTES THAT- MY OWN COUNTY SANTA CLARA COUNTY- IT HAS A PLENTY OF AUTHORIZATION FOR THE JUDICIAL POSITIONS BUT- WHAT WE'RE HEARING FROM THE COUNTY AND IT YOU KNOW AGAIN MAYBE MAYBE CHURCHCENTER WOULD COMMENT ON THIS GIVEN HIS TIES TO THAT COUNTY. IS THAT- THERE'S A BACKLOG THERE OF INMATES WAITING DISPOSITION THAT IS NOW AVERAGING ELEVEN MONTHS BUT A NOT. ENOUGH I GOT THAT INFORMATION FROM THE C. O. O. OF THE COUNTY SANTA CLARA- BECAUSE THEY'RE BEING ASKED TO TRY TO PROVIDE SOME RELIEF TO THE COURT SYSTEM THERE- IN. THE WHAT I WHAT I REALLY WANT TO ASK IS. THESE DOLLARS THAT ARE INTENDED TO CLEAR BACKLOG OR THE ARE THERE ARE THEY BEING BASED ON OUR WILL BE BASED ON. ON WHERE THE NEED IS- EIGHT EIGHT. OR IS HE NOW LET ME JUST ME JUST PUT RIGHT THERE AND JUST US A QUICK AND HE QUESTION. RESTORED LOWER WITH REGARD TO THE BACKLOG FUNDING AND WE ARE VERY GRATEFUL FOR- WE WENT THROUGH TO YOU- DISTRIBUTIONS TO THE COURTS- WE INITIALLY TOOK DATA- BACKED OUT LAST MARCH AND THE INFORMED OUR FIRST ALLOCATION THAT WENT TO THE COURTS IN OCTOBER THAT WAS AN INITIAL THIRTY MILLION DOLLAR ALLOCATION OUT- THE SECOND ALLOCATION WHEN OUT IN JANUARY THIS PAST JANUARY AND WAS INFORMED BY OUR OUR LATEST DATA POOL- THAT WAS- OF JUNE LAST YEAR WE ARE. CONTINUALLY COLLECTING DATA ON WHERE THE COURTS ARE RELATIVE TO THEIR BACKLOGS- WELL- FORM- FURTHER DISCUSSIONS WITH YOU AND THE ADMINISTRATION ON ADDITIONAL NEEDS AND AGAIN- THE STRUCTURAL FUNDING WILL GREATLY ASSIST THOSE COURTS ALL CORDS- THAT ARE UNDER- WELL- RIGHT WELL OUR- COURSE THERE LEAST. IN THE- TO TACKLE THE BACK- AS WELL AS A- WIDE FOR. OF OTHER THINGS THE BACKLOG FUNDS. WERE ON. TO ALL COURTS THAT. IDENTIFIED A BACK. I HOPE THAT'S HELPFUL CENTER.

THAT'S PROPOSED FOR THREE ADDITIONAL COURT JUDGE SEEM TO BE TIED TO TOBACCO I GUESS WHAT I'M IS. I KNOW COUNTY MY OWN WE'RE IS NOT THE CHIPSETS THE PROBLEM- IS ELSE'S IS CREATING THE BACKLOG PERHAPS IT'S A COMBINATION OF THINGS- BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S SOMETHING HERE IN THESE DOLLARS THAT WERE- BEING ASKED TO SUPPORT OUR PROVEN. IN THE BUDGET THAT'S GOING TO CLEAR. A BACKLOG WHATEVER THE CAUSE NOTCHES JUDGESHIPS- HE AND IT AND AGAIN I DON'T WANT TO RAISE FALSE CONCERN. BOTH OF THEM. IT MIGUEL MARQUEZ THAT THE CEO OF SANTA CLARA COUNTY. IN RESPONSE TO MY QUESTION ABOUT WHAT'S CAUSING THE BACKLOG TELLS ME OF A CENSUS OF TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED INMATES TWO THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED SANTA CLARA COUNTY AS OF LAST WEEK TWO THOUSAND OF THEM SHOULD HAVE RECEIVED A COURT DISPOSITION ALREADY UNDER NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES SO THE COUNTIES. NOT ONLY. DURING THE COST OF THOSE INMATES FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME BUT OBVIOUSLY THE HUMANITARIAN CONCERN OF PEOPLE OF BEING LOCKED UP- WHEN THEY SHOULD ALREADY HAVE THE DISPOSITIONS ARE CONCERNED SO THAT'S WHAT'S DRIVING MY QUESTION HOW DO WE GET THAT MOVING BESIDES JUDGESHIPS. SENATOR CENTER IS THE CENTER OF THIS IS THAT ARE JUDGED THANK YOU FOR RECOGNIZING ME I I'M THE PRESIDING JUDGE IN SANTA CLARA. AS YOU KNOW- AND CURVATURE IN THE TRIAL COURT PRESIDING JUDGES ADVISORY COMMITTEE. I THINK YOU'RE QUITE SIR TO ME OR TO AND TRYING TO ADDRESS THE NEAR IN MY COULD.

RIGHT- JUST AS WELL AS JUDGESHIP IN THE BACK BUILT ON IT WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT IN TOTAL- ARE STATEWIDE AVERAGE RIGHT NOW FOR FUNDING IS JUST OVER 80% OF WHAT THE PROPOSED FUNDING OUR OUR- STATEWIDE AVERAGE WITH JUMP TO EIGHTY EIGHT PERCENT- WHICH IS. A SIGNIFICANT. INCREASE AND WITH THAT I THINK THAT YOU CERTAINLY CAN EXPECT IMPROVE SERVICE DELIVERY TO THE PEOPLE CALIFORNIA- WITH REGARD TO OUR ENSURING THAT THERE WON'T BE CONTINUE NEED- AND QUITE FRANKLY HOURS INFLATIONARY- IMPACTS. AFFECT THE JUDICIARY- THERE WILL LIKELY BE AN EROSION AT SOME POINT WHERE WE MAY NEED TO COME BACK TO YOU BUT I CAN SAY NOW THAT- AS PROPOSED. THIS MAKES A SIGNIFICANT- IMPROVEMENT TO THE JUDICIARY- IN OUR CAPACITY TO SERVE THE PUBLIC. AND JUST TO FOLLOW BILL QUICKLY SEARCH AND I WON'T HOLD YOU TO IT BUT ROUGHLY. HOW MUCH TIME DOES IS BY YOU RIGHT I'M I'M TRYING TO GET A SENSE OF AS WE LOOK INTO THE FUTURE. AND WE SHOULD BE AS POLICY MAKERS THINK ABOUT A SMARTER. AND MORE ACCURATE WAY TO FIND THE JUSTICE SYSTEM YOU KNOW WHAT'S THAT TIME I LOOK LIKE WHEN WOULD YOU SAY- DATA MINIMUM LIKE WE SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT THE NEXT PHASE. TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN I WAS RESEARCHING A- ALL AT TO THAT IS A VERY. QUESTION IN THAT- I CAN'T FOR SEE WHAT THE INFLATIONARY FACTORS WILL BE IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS I WOULD THINK THAT FOR THE NEXT FEW YEARS THOUGH THAT- THAT SHOULD THINGS REMAIN STABLE THAT THE JUDICIARY WOULD BE AND VERY GOOD SHAPE- ABOUT SAID AGAIN- CENTER I WISH. I COULD BE MORE CLEAR WITH YOU ABOUT THE ECONOMIC FORECAST OF YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT'S PROJECTED IN THE FUTURE- AND I APPRECIATE THAT AND YOU KNOW IT'S I THINK IT'S CLEAR IF WE PURSUE SOME OF THE OTHER- DESIST SUBJECT AREAS WE TALKED ABOUT PARTICULARLY. FATAL EQUITY ON FINES AND FEES YOU KNOW WE WILL PUT YOU IN A POSITION RELATIVELY SOON SO IT'S SOMETHING I WOULD ARGUE WE START THINKING ABOUT NOW BUT I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS. THANK YOU SIR NEWMAN WHAT WE WILL DO- BECAUSE WE'RE RUNNING LATE HERE. WE'RE TRYING TO- REACH- THE END OF THE AGENDA BY ELEVEN THIRTY- BUT THESE ARE REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT QUESTIONS NOT ONLY FOR THE DISTRICTS REPRESENT MORE IMPORTANTLY FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. RATHER THAN A QUESTION I THINK I'LL JUST LEAVE WITH YOU MY THOUGHTS THAT WE NEED MORE SPECIFIC. UNDERSTANDING AS TO HOW THIS ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR. EQUITY FUND IS GOING TO BE USED ALL A MORE NARROW. DEFINITION OF HOW IT'S GOING TO BE USED- AND THE SECOND THING I WANT TO BRING UP IS WITH REGARDS TO THE NUMBER. OF JOBS JUDGE SHIPS. THAT ARE NEEDED AND THAT WE INTEND TO. OF FILL UP WHAT STRIKES ME AS- PRETTY. VERY SURPRISING IS THE RIVERSIDE SAN BERNARD DINO AREAS MAKE UP ABOUT HALF OF THE TOTAL STATE WIDE. JUDGE NUMBER OF JUDGESHIPS NEEDED- AND THAT'S SHOCKING THAT AREA IS PROBABLY THE FASTEST GROWING AREA IN THE STATE. IT'S AN ENORMOUS GEOGRAPHICAL AREA- AND I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO HEAR NOT THIS MOMENT. BUT HEAR BACK ABOUT HOW WE INTEND TO. ADDRESS THAT IT'S NOT JUST A MATTER OF CATCH UP IT'S A MATTER OF GETTING AHEAD- THAT'S AN AREA WHERE THERE WERE THE- THE GROWTH OF THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE.

I THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONTINUED SUPPORT. THANK YOU MISS MCCORMICK- ANYONE ELSE FROM JUDICIAL COUNCIL MISTER JIMENEZ. I'M IN THE FINANCE. AND- WANTED TO PROVIDE OVER TO THE ALLEY OF RECOMMENDED- DETAIL OUT IN THE JANITOR- I WHICH IS TO SHIP FULL RESPONSE FOR OR CONSTRUCTION THE GENERAL FUND WHICH IS NOT THAT THE- OF THIS OR CONSERVATIVE KINDS BONDS IS HOW A RESULT A BRA UP THE DAUGHTER IN OF THE DECLINE REVENUE FOR NOT THIS BUT OR OTHER. FUNDS INCLUDING SPECIAL FUNDS UNDER ANY SORT FOR LUNCH BE CAN AN ABOUT CALL OF HOW TO IMPENDING ISSUES FOR OTHER SPECIAL. ON NOW BUT INCLUDES THE FORTY ONE TIME GENERAL ON YEAH I IN THE BUDGET TO THAT FILL STEPS YES TO REMAIN SOLVED WITHOUT SIR LEVELS THE BUDGET. OF ALL THE DEVELOPED PERMANENT SOLUTION ADDRESS INSTALLED NOT ON IN THE SPA BUT OTHER THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISLI. I'M ANY WITH THE LEGISLATURE ANALYST'S OFFICE AGAIN- SO AS AS NOTED WE DO CONCERN WITH THE LAWN TERM SO IS AND THE PLANS IT'S NOT BEING YET REQUIRE SIGNAL GENERAL FUND ON ON BASIS FOR AS ABOUT TWO AT LEAST YOUR MILLION ANNUALLY FOR NEARLY A DECADE. JUST TO PAY FOR THE DAY SERVICE FOR ALL COMPLETE QUITE HOW. SO IN ORDER TO PERMANENT ADDRESS LONG TERM SAW OF THE COUNTRY OF DO RIGHT THE CHEF FORCE FOR TRIAL COURT CONSTRUCTION TO THE GENERAL FUND AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE WOULD NOTE- AND IN LIGHT OF THE SENATORS AND DISCUSSION ON THE PRIOR ISSUES IS THAT THIS IS ACTUALLY CONSISTENT WITH OUR RECOMMENDATIONS ON OVERHAULING THE BROADER COMMERCIAL FINANCE THE SYSTEM AND SO GENERALLY WE DO THINK THAT. SHOULD BE DEPOSITED INTO THE GENERAL FUND AND OPERATING OUT SO CONSISTENT WITH THAT FOR THIS PARTICULAR CLIENT AND SHIFTING OVER THAT. FOR RESPONSIBILITY THAT WOULD INCLUDE. SHIFTING THE- AND ALL. TO THE DOWN CLIENTS. READING THE GENERAL- ANY DOLLARS TO ME AND LEVEL OF SERVICE AND ALSO THE ANY FOR THE REVENUE WOULD OTHERWISE DEPOSIT INTO THAT CONSTRUCTION ACCOUNT INTO THE GENERAL FUND INSTEAD SO THEY'RE STILL AVAILABLE TO OFFSET THOSE SHIFTED COSTS AS A WIN THIS AWARD- ENABLE THE LEGISLATURE TO DO IS TO ENSURE THAT ALL CONSTRUCTION RELATED OBLIGATIONS ARE BEING FULLY ACCOUNTED FOR. ONE WERE EVALUATING THE STATE'S BROADER FISCAL CONDITION AND DETERMINED AND WHEN THE LEGISLATURE IS DETERMINING ITS GENERAL FUND PRIORITIES. REGARDLESS OF WHETHER YOU SHIFT FOR RESPONSIBILITY OVER WE DO RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE APPROPRIATE FUNDING FOR FACILITY RELATED PROJECTS BASED ON ITS GENERAL PLAN PRIORITIES. AND SO IF THE FACILITIES FOR THE JUDICIAL BRANCH IS A PRIORITY AS USUAL GRANT HAS IDENTIFIED SIGNIFICANT NEED- THE LEGISLATURE COULD ACTUALLY CONSIDER ADDITIONAL ONE TIME FUNDING FOR QUICK FACILITY PROJECTS SUCH AS FACILITY MODIFICATION OR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. BECAUSE OF THIS TYPE OF SPENDING IS EXCLUDABLE UNDER THE STATE OF CORPORATIONS ONE. ABOUT SOMETHING THAT AND YOU WANT JUST WANTED TO KNOW WHY FREEDOM WILL BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOUNG. OKAY FOR NOT TO A MICHAEL. YES YES AND CRITICIZING THIS I'M TO MAKE A CALL ON TAKE YOUR EXAMPLE MOVE IN THE INTEREST OF TIME THAT IS- I AGREE WHOLEHEARTEDLY WITH THE THE UP. BUSES THAT ARE OUT THERE PAIN DEBT SERVICE- EIGHT IF THEY'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO CLEAR BACKLOG I MEAN IT'S TIED TOGETHER MAYBE THAT'S A STRONG STATEMENT BUT THEY'RE GONNA HELP LET'S SAY THEY'RE GONNA HAVE A MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TIME CLEARING BACKLOG. BUT IN THEIR OWN SYSTEMS IF- WITH- USING REVENUE FORCE TO PAY DEBT SERVICE ON CON CONSTRUCTION AND BE A BIG MAINTENANCE PROJECTS- THE COMMENT I HAVE IS IN ADDITION TO THAT BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT RETIRING DEBT SERVICE. FOR CURRENT- PROJECTS OR PAT PASS PRIZE- THAT THE- IS STILL BE SYSTEMS ARE STILL PAYING FOR. IT IT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH TO JUST GO FORWARD AND SAY. ANYONE IS COMING IN WITH THE NEW PROJECT. WE'RE GONNA SHIP THAT TO THE GENERAL FUND. BUT BUT- YOU KNOW ALL ALL- YOU KNOW- A NO GOOD DEEDS FROM THE PASTOR GOING TO BE PUNISHED- YOU COULD JUST KEEP PAYING YOUR DEBT SERVICE ON ON THE ON THE NICE TO COURTHOUSE THAT YOU BUILT A FEW YEARS AGO I DON'T THINK THAT'S FAIR ANYTHING THAT NEEDS TO BE RESOLVED. IF BEFORE GOING TO- IN A TO SOME KIND OF AN OVERHAUL HERE IN TERMS OF SHIFTING TO THE GENERAL FUND THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR- FIFTY ONE HAVE- ANYONE WANT TO RESPOND TO CENTER COURT DISEASE. COMMENTS YEAH I'M ADAM SCHIFF I MAY JUST TO CLARIFY THE TRIAL COURTS ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT PAYMENT OF THIS DEBT SERVICE. AS A STATE AND JUDICIAL COUNCIL RESPONSIBILITY WHILE THERE MAY BE. A STORE GOAL PROJECTS THAT HAD A COURT SHARE- GENERALLY THOUGH THE PROGRAM IS FUNDED FROM. THE STAFF AT THE STATE LEVEL AND NOT A TRUCK OR COSTS. I'M INCLUDING FACILITY. MODIFICATIONS BILL IN IN MY IN MY- SIR WE HAVE OVER ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS DEBT SIR FOR THE FAMILY COURTHOUSE IN DOWNTOWN SAN JOSE. AND THAT WE'RE STILL PAYING ON. IT AND WE JUST CAME OFF OF AN ITEM WERE WERE. DELIBERATING ABOUT SUBSIDIZING THE COURTS TO CLEAR BACKLOG BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO HIRE TO HIRE PEOPLE TO CLEAR THE BACKLOG SO. THE POINT I'M MAKING IS IT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH JUST TO LOOK FORWARD- PATIENTS NEW CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS TO THE GENERAL FUND YOU GOTTA GO BACK AND LOOK AT THE INEQUITIES IN TERMS OF WHO'S PAYING DEBT SERVICE IN THE PAST. SO I DON'T THINK IT'S- I DON'T THINK IT'S- YOUR COMMENT THAT. THAT'S NOT THE CASE IS AS ACCURATE IT IS A CASE OF MY COUNTY AND- THAT FOR A FACT. MISTER JIMENEZ ANY COMMENTS. RESPONSE. I WAS JUST ARE YOU KNOW WE MEETING WITH KNOWLEDGE THE COMMENTS AND- WE CAN BETTER WHICH WE CAN WORK WITH YOUR STAFF TO BETTER UNDERSTAND- YOUR YOU'VE GOT A HE FURTHER YOU MIGHT HAVE AND- GHENEAINFORMATION ME. THANK YOU MADAM. THANK YOU SIR. OKAY I THINK- SENATOR NEWMAN ANYTHING OKAY ALSO WE DO HAVE I THINK IT JUST TO SUM IT UP OR AT LEAST A ONE POINT IS THIS LONG TERM PLAN. WE SHOULD HAVE A LONG TERM PLAN A MORE PERMANENT- PLAN ON TAKING INTO ACCOUNT ALL THE COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE TODAY HERE BY THE COMMITTEE APPRECIATE THAT- THANK YOU WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO. THE SHOE. FOR FOUR FIVE AND SIX- THESE ARE REAL SO EVEN THOUGH WE'RE GOING TO HEAR- FROM THEM INDIVIDUALLY THEY ARE SOMEWHAT RELATED SO WITH WE COULD SAY THE CONVERSATION UP TO THE END OF THE THREE AND I THINK IT MAKES MORE SENSE IN TERMS OF THE QUESTIONS THAT WE WILL HAVE SO- THE FIRST THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL ISSUE FOR WILL PRESENT A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF HOW THEY FIT TOGETHER AND THEN WE'LL MOVE ON SPECIFICALLY TO EACH ISSUE OF JUDICIAL. COUNCIL. HI MADAM CHAIR AND- NUMBERS MY NAME'S ROBERT- YEAH I AM THE CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER FOR JUDICIAL COUNCIL I'LL PROVIDE YOU WITH A QUICK OVERVIEW OF HOW THESE NEXT THREE. PROPOSALS FIT TOGETHER. EACH OF THESE THREE ARE COMPLIMENTARY OF EACH OTHER BUT THEY ARE DISTINCT STATE DON'T OVERLAP AND THEY COVER DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF THE COURTS BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT. WE HAVE A MODEL FOR CATEGORIZING TECHNOLOGY INITIATIVES SUMMER BROAD BRANCH BY PROGRAMS AND OTHERS ARE INDIVIDUAL LOCAL PROGRAMS SO THE PROPOSALS FOR IT MODERNIZATION. DATA INFORMATION GOVERNANCE AND REMOTE ACCESS FOLLOW THIS STRUCTURE OF BRANCH BY TWO LOCAL PROGRAMS STARTING WITH A BRANCH WIDE PROGRAMS THAT DATA AND INFORMATION GOVERNANCE PROPOSAL FOCUSES ON ESTABLISHING A BRANCH WIDE DATA PLATFORMS THAT WOULD BE ABLE TO PROVIDE BETTER ACCESS AND REPORTING TO BRANCH MY COURT DATE. THE I. TEAM MODERNIZATION PROPOSAL CONTAINS SOME BRANCH WHY PROGRAMS SUCH AS THE JUDICIAL BRANCH INFORMATION SECURITY OFFICE ENSURE TECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS THAT ALL THE COURTS CAN USE SUCH AS NOTIFICATION REMINDER SERVICES. TO COMMUNICATE UPCOMING APPOINTMENTS AND DEADLINES TO THE PUBLIC. MOVING ON TO LOCAL COURT PROGRAMS T. I. Q. MODERNIZATION PROPOSAL ALSO CONTAINS A PROPOSED FINDINGS. FOR A LOCAL COURT INITIATIVES SUCH AS CREATING MORE DIGITAL ONLINE SERVICES. OR INCREASING PUBLIC ASSETS CHIU INFORMATION BY DIGITIZING PAPER RECORDS SO THAT THEY CAN BECOME AVAILABLE ONLINE AND THEN FINALLY THE LAST ACCESS TO COURT PROCEEDINGS AND THIS PROPOSAL RECOMMENDS THE UPGRADE OF WIRING AND EQUIPMENT IN THE OLDER COURT ROOMS ACROSS THE STATE TO IMPROVE AUDIO AND VIDEO CAPABILITIES. SO THESE PROPOSALS OVERALL ARE RECOGNIZED THE GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE AND REPRESENTS THE MATURATION OF BRANCH CAPABILITIES WE'RE PASSED EMBARRASSMENT OF HELP THE COURTS TO MODERNIZE PRESERVE ACCESS TO JUSTICE BROUGH REMOTE PROCEEDINGS. AND BEGAN COLLECTING DATA ON A COURT. USAGE AND PROCESSING AND SO WILL GOING FORWARD WITH TO BE ABLE TO CAN THESE. AND PROVIDE A STABLE IN SUSTAINED ENVIRONMENT FOR OUR USER. THANK YOU FOR MUCH I. THINK OKAY SO WE'LL MOVE ON TO THE SPECIFIC- ISSUE- ISSUE FOUR WITH THE BRANCH WIDER APPRECIATE YOUR THE CONNECTION THAT YOU MADE SO THAT WE CAN STEP BACK A LITTLE BIT AND THEN OUR DIVE INTO EACH ISSUE NOW- MISTER YOUNG ARE YOU GOING TO PRESENT ISSUE FOR. ACTUALLY THAT WILL BE A OTHER PENDANT OKAY. THIS BETTER THANK YOU. THANK YOU ADAM CHAIRING COMMITTEE FOR ALLOWING US TO PRESENT ON ISSUE NUMBER FOUR WHICH IS THE IT MODERNIZATION. ASISTIR A YOUNG MENTIONED THIS REALLY IS A COMBINATION OF RANGE WIDE INITIATIVES AND LOCAL INDUSTRY CHAIR. CLEAR IT HAS. FIVE SPECIFIC TO IT WHICH IT- THE IMPLEMENTATION OF IT IS BRANCH. SECURE OFFICE- AS WE KNOW IS ABSOLUTELY GREAT OUR DAILY- BRANCHES NOBODY THAN ANY TE OTHER STATES AGENCY SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT CONTINUE RELY AND IMPLEMENT NEW SHE'S TECHNOLOGY. WE HAVE THE SECURITY AVAILABLE TO PROTECT US AND THE CITIZENS OF. THE IS ITEM THIS OUT OF THE OF THE FIVE ACTS SUPPOSED IN THE MODERN. OF YOUR CORD AND THE COURT OF THE- THIS IS AS- NEED WHERE. RIGHT NOW THE COURTS APPEAL DO NOT RAISE ANY FUNDING FOR ON OR TECHNOLOGY INITIATIVES THEY ARE IN. DESPERATE TO GET THESE MY OF THESE INCLUDING OR MODOC TO THEIR IT DOCUMENTS NEED TO UPDATE CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS AND THAT RELATES AS WELL STAFF TO ACTUALLY. ALL THE THAT HAPPEN IN THE COURTS APPEAL THIS COURT COURT DOES WELL WHICH IS PROVIDING. FOR INITIATIVES THAT TO IS A SMALL AMOUNT OF MONEY ANNUALLY THAT WILL ALLOW THEM CONTINUE TO SERVE. A TECHNOLOGY IN. OR MODERNIZATION EFFORTS THAT WE DO HAVE A BRANCH WIDE LEVEL OR THE LOCAL LAW. I'M THE FOURTH AREA IS. ON GRAND WHY ISSUE YOU. MISTER YOUNG MENTION THE- AUTOMATED MESSAGING SERVICES THAT WE ARE ROLLING OUT RIGHT NOW WE HAVE A COUPLE PORTS THAT ARE JUST YOU KNOW. IT IS A SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD TO ACOSTA OR ANOTHER EXAMPLE WOULD BE. ASSUME THAT MATCHES LIKE AND COURSE THE OF THE LAW EXAMPLE I WOULD PROVIDE WITH THAT WOULD BE ESTATE. WHICH IS ALL OF THE FIFTY TROPPER FINANCE SYSTEM. AND THE ABILITY TO CALL. AND ON A ON GREEN BAY SO YOU CHANGE AD HERE TO TECHNO STATE AND- STANDARDS. TECHNOLOGY OF ALL. AND ALLOW ONE WHICH IS THE HE WON FOUR APPS MONITOR. IS FOR LOW COURT WHICH IS. THE ABILITY TO RECALL TO TAKE. THEIR BUSINESS NAY THEIR LOCAL COURT NEEDS MAKE YOU TECHNOLOGY YOUR CROTCH I HANSTEEN SERVICE FOR THE PUBLIC. AN EXAMPLE THIS MAY BE IN HERE WEBSITE SEARCH. OR IT MAY BE. YOU KNOW SHE ALSO WHEN YOU'RE WALKING INTO THE- TO HELP DOCUMENTS IN THE DID YOU JUST OF THOSE. WHAT WE DO KNOW ABOUT THE LEGISLATURE HAS PER. ARE TWO I EACH CORE OUT OF JAIL PLACE AND TALK. AND THEY HAVE TO NEED. THIS YOU KNOW FIFTH MARLYS. PROJECT ALLOWS US WORK WITH THOSE CORD TO BE ABLE PROVIDE SERVICES THE PUBLIC. EXPECT IS THE- OF THIS PRETTY REASON REQUEST. AN ISSUE OF FOR. HI MARK MANAGEMENT FINANCE- WE JUST WANT TO REITERATE THAT THIS REQUEST IS CRITICAL TO PROVIDING ONGOING SUPPORT FOR FRENCH FRIES- MODERNIZATION PROJECTS THAT PROMOTE. IT'S ACCESS TO THE COURT SYSTEM. ARDS TO THE ELIAS'S RECOMMENDATION TO FIND BRANCH LIKE I. T. BOB PROJECTS AT THE DISCRETION OF THE LEGISLATURE WE WOULD JUST LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL TECHNOLOGY COMMITTEE HAS A RESPONSIBILITY OF ALLOCATING ALL RESOURCES FROM THIS PROPOSAL AND THEY ARE IS CERTAINLY WELL POSITIONED FOR THIS ROLE BECAUSE THEY HAVE A BACKGROUND AND EXPERIENCE MAXIMIZE THE RESOURCES PROVIDED TO AND- PROVIDED AND CHIU CRISTINA CHRISTENSEN STRATEGY TO ALLOW. A TRIAL COURT'S ENGINE JUDICIAL BRANCH TO MODERNIZE AND EQUITABLE MANNER OF THE OUT WE BELIEVE THAT THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL SHOULD HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO SPEND ITS RESOURCES ON AN ONGOING BASIS- TO EFFECTIVELY PROVIDE CONTINUED SUPPORT PROGRAM PROGRAMS- FATHER WERE POINTED. THE TERM BASIS. THANK YOU OBVIOUSLY- I NEED ONLY ONE THE L. A. SO AS A OF MEN SHE WE DO HAVE CONCERNS AWAY- THE FOURTH AND FIFTH AND THEN WERE IS LAID OUT ON PAGE OF YOUR DONE ABOUT ABOUT TWENTY SEVEN GOING TO THE JUDICIAL BROWN MODERNIZE PROGRAM AND SO WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE MODIFY THE PROPOSAL TO INCREASE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT SPECIFICALLY UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL THE JUDICIAL BRANCH WOULD HAVE ONGOING DISCRETION ON THE USE OF A DEDICATED POT I'M GOING FUNDING. OF THIS REDUCES LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT COMPARED TO WHAT THE LEGISLATURE CURRENTLY HAS NOW PROPOSALS ARE GOING TO THE ANNUAL BUDGET PROCESS MR THAT PROCESS THE LEGISLATURE IS ABLE TO ASSESS WHETHER EACH BUDGET REQUEST ACCURATELY IDENTIFIES THE PROBLEM OR NEED AND WHETHER OR NOT YOU'RE BEING PRESENTED WITH A COST EFFECTIVE SOLUTION CLEAR OUTCOMES COMPLETE AND ACCURATE COST AS WELL AS METRICS TO KIND OF MEASURE WHETHER. IT'S GOING SUCCESSFULLY- WE DOING KNOWLEDGE THAT THERE IS SOME BENEFIT TO PROVIDING DESTRUCTION OVER A SMALL PART OF FUNDING SPECIFICALLY THAT IT WOULD ALLOW THE JUDICIAL BRANCH TED IT QUICKLY TO RESPOND AS NEEDS ARISE I WOULD ALSO ELIMINATE THE NEED FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER REALLY SMALL PROJECTS SO IN TERMS OF BALANCING THE TWO- TO THE EXTENT THE LEGISLATURE THINGS THIS IS A PRIORITY WE WOULD RECOMMEND TO THE LEGISLATURE INCREASED LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT BY SPECIFYING LIMITS ON THE TYPES OF PROJECTS THAT CAN BE FUNDED. FOR CITING A TOTAL PER PROJECT COSTS LIMIT ON PROJECTS THAT COULD BE FUNDED FROM THIS PART OF FUNDING AND SO THIS WOULD LIMIT THE NUMBER OR TYPES OF PROJECTS THAT COULD BE PURSUED WITHOUT LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT DURING THE ANNUAL STATE BUDGET PROCESS WE WOULD ALSO RECOMMEND REQUIRING ANNUAL REPORTING FROM JUDICIAL COUNCIL ON WHAT PROJECTS ARE EXPECTED TO RECEIVE FUNDING AND HOW THE FINDINGS WERE ACTUALLY USED IN THE PRIOR YEAR AND THIS WOULD ALLOW THE LEGISLATURE TO CONDUCT REGULAR OVERSIGHT OF THE PROGRAMS TO PROVIDE INPUT. IF THE LEGISLATURE WAS INTERESTED BEFORE FOR THE MONIES WENT OUT AND ALSO TO I. REAS LEAD TO ACTION MIGHT BE NEEDED OR DOES. SO WITHOUT CONCLUDE COMMENTS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- LET'S SEE SHE WAS UP TO TAKE QUESTIONS. COMMENTS OUR MOVE TO ISSUE FIVE. OKAY YES IF WE COULD ASK THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL TO COMMENT ON ISSUE FIVE PLEASE. HI MY NAME'S- ROBERT REALLY AYE AGAIN CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER JUDICIAL BRANCH I CAN COMMENT ON ISSUES FIVE THE DATA AND INFORMATION GOVERNANCE PROPOSAL THIS PROPOSAL BUILDS UPON PREVIOUS ONE TIME FUNDING TO PILOT. DATA ANALYTICS PLATFORM THAT WAS INITIALLY IMPLEMENTED THROUGH AN INNOVATION GRANT RECEIVED BY THE SUPERIOR COURT OF ORANGE AND WE'VE BEEN UTILIZING OUR EXPERIENCE WITH THESE PILOTS TO COLLECT AND ANALYZE DATA FROM PRE TRIAL PILOT'S ABILITY TO PAY PROGRAM AND THE BRANCH BY JUDICIAL BRANCH STATISTICAL INFORMATION SYSTEM OR JIM SAYS. IN MAY TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL APPROVES THE DATA AND INFORMATION GOVERNANCE POLICY CONCEPTS AND THE BRANCH IS NOW AGGRESSIVELY STARTING TO USE DATA TO MANAGE ITS OPERATIONS CONDUCT POLICY ANALYSIS CAN TRACK AND MANAGE BACKLOGS SO THIS PROPOSAL WOULD ESTABLISH A STABLE ON ONE PLATFORM THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO CONTINUE OUR WORK IN THIS AREA. ARE EXPANDING IT ACROSS THE BRANCH TO ALL COURTS AN ADDITIONAL PROGRAM AREAS SUCH AS SELF HELP JERRY AND OTHERS AND THIS WILL RESULT IN A MORE TIMELY DATA REPORTING ARE REPLACING TIME CONSUMING.

WELL THAT SOUNDS MORE LIKE A RISK GOOD RECRUITMENT BUT HOW DO YOU ADDRESS THAT OUR RETENTION ISSUE.

AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE- PRESENTATION BY- AND CAL BCB. GOOD MORNING AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME HERE- AS YOU KNOW THE PROPOSAL FOR CONSOLIDATION WAS IN THE GOVERNOR'S TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY BUDGET AND MANY THINGS HAVE CHANGED SINCE THEN THINKING ABOUT THIS ISSUE THE ADMINISTRATION IS TAKING STEPS TO FULLY ANALYZE IT PULLING TOGETHER DEPARTMENTS IN THE STATE START BUTTONS OF CRIME. TO THROUGH HOW THEY SERVE VICTIMS WHETHER THERE ARE OVERLAPS GAPS OR NEED FOR CONSOLIDATION AND GIVEN THAT AS A STATE WE'VE BEEN FOCUSED SO MUCH ON THE RESPONSE TO THE PANDEMIC WE'RE JUST BEGINNING THESE CONVERSATIONS AGAIN AND BUT WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO KEEP THE TRADE. INFORMED AS WE MOVE FORWARD. OKAY. DOES THAT LA O'S OFFICE HAVE ANY COMMENTS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR JUST COMPUTERS WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND I WAS MISLED HILL- INDICATED THE TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY BUDGET I'M AT THAT PUT IN PLACE EIGHT CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK FOR CONSOLIDATING THE VICTIMS PROGRAMS AT BOTH THE VICTIMS COMPENSATION BOARD AS WELL AS THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES WHICH ARE THE TWO DEPARTMENTS WITHIN THE STATE. HAVE THE PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY FOR MOST OF THE STATE'S VICTIMS PROGRAMS THERE ARE SOME SMALLER PROGRAMS IN OTHER DEPARTMENTS AS WELL- AND THIS WAS AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE LEGISLATURE IN THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE ADMINISTRATION HAVE PUT FORWARD A REVISION PROPOSAL- IN THAT YEAR- TO- CONSOLIDATE THE PROGRAMS FROM THE STREET APARTMENT. INTO A NEW DEPARTMENT UNDER THE GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS AGENCY ON THAT WAY AS A CONCEPTUAL PROPOSAL AND WAS AGREED IN CONCEPT AT THAT TIME AND AT THE TIME THE ADMINISTRATION HAD AND DETERMINED IT WOULD NEED A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME TO PUT TOGETHER A FULL IMPLEMENTATION- PROPOSAL AND WORK OUT SOME OF THE DETAILS AND HAVE. A GREAT TO PROVIDE A BUDGET PROPOSAL IN THE TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE FISCAL YEAR TO IMPLEMENT BE CONCEPTUAL AGREEMENT THAT WAS MADE IN NINETEEN TWENTY THAT BUDGET PROPOSAL WAS NEVER PROVIDED AND IT HAS BEEN INDICATED HAS MISLED HOME NOTED THAT THE ONSET OF THE COLD IN NINETEEN PANDEMIC. HAS SOMEWHAT SIDETRACKED ON THOSE CONVERSATIONS AND SO THE PROPOSAL WAS NEVER DEVELOPED. AND SUBMITTED. JUST PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT HE- I'M I AM I IS OF THE US HERE BY. THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT. AND COME UP- OVER NUMEROUS TIMES. AT THE REQUEST OF THE LATE. NUMEROUS OF THE LEGISLATURE LOGISTIC STAFF HAVE WORKED. EACH AND FOR ETTER OR- ISAAC PRO- THE YEAR. I'M IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN THE BUDGET REQUIRED. COMPETENCY BOARD AND- YES TO WORK TOGETHER ON A PLAN TO DO SO. IN TWENTY FIFTEEN OUR OFFICE PUT OUT A REPORT- THAT FOUND THAT HAVING VICTIMS PROGRAMS PRIMARILY AT AND WE ASK. COMPENSATION BOARD ON BEING SEPARATED BY THOSE TWO DEPARTMENTS REALLY LACKED COORDINATION VICTIMS PROGRAMS- RESULTING IN NUMEROUS ISSUES THAT AT IT HAS THE STATE NOT PROVIDING THE BEST SERVICE TO VICTIMS SENATE COURAGE. AND IN PARTICULAR WE FOUND THAT THE STATE IS LIKELY LISTINGS AND MISSING OPPORTUNITIES TO MAXIMIZE FEDERAL DOLLARS BY DRAWING DOWN VICTIMS OF CRIME ACT FUNDING- THIS IS BECAUSE THAT FUNDING IN THE DRIVE DOWN TAKES PLACE UNDER COUNTY SEAT- BUT SOME OF THE PROGRAMS UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES. PROVIDE FUNDING FOR VERY SIMILAR SERVICES BACK NAY QUALIFY FOR THE STATE OKAY DOLLAR MATCHING FUNDS- IN ADDITION WE FOUND THAT HAVING NUMEROUS TIMES SMALL PROGRAMS CAN MAKE ADMINISTRATION THE PROGRAM'S INEFFICIENT. CAN COMPLICATE THE ABILITY FOR AND THAT TENDS AND THAT TIME SERVICE PROVIDERS TO ACCESS SPENDING. BY HAVING TO. APPLY FOR TO BRANDS. AND SO- GIVE THE LEAD JUST AN THE IMAGE HAD AGREED ON CONSOLIDATE IN THE PARK WE- SUGGEST YOU MAY TO GET IN FIRM LINE THE NEXT. FIND OUT WHERE I PURPLE WILL BE TO DO SO. SHE THANK YOU MISS UP OF. DO GET FROM THE DID MINISTRATION FOR FINANCED YOU HAVE ANY. REASON TO THOSE MORNING CLARK DEPARTMENT FINANCE- WHAT IS OUT THERE ARE BOGUS SPEECH TO BE ON CREATING A BETTER EXPERIENCE FOR VICTIMS AND ALSO- PAYING ATTENTION TO FISCAL AND PROGRAMMATIC FISHES THERE WERE FULL REPORTS AND- OR WHAT CBS RECENTLY JUST SAID. IT WILL CONTINUE IDENTIFIED THE APPROPRIATE PROGRAMS THAT COULD BE AFFECTED BY CONSOLIDATION. UP TO YOU- DID YOU FIND ALSO THAT WE WERE NOT GETTING AS MANY FEDERAL DOLLARS- AS WE COULD OF BECAUSE OF THIS SEPARATION OF SERVICES. KEVIN CLARK BERMAN OF FINANCE- I CAN'T SPEAK TO THAT SPECIFIC POINT BUT WE WILL TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT OUR FEDERAL APPROPRIATION INCREASE IN THAT UPCOMING PROPOSAL. OKAY AND THEN OF A FINAL QUESTION FOR ME IS HOW WHAT'S IN PLACE RIGHT NOW THAT HELPS VICTIMS NAVIGATE THEIR RESOURCES AT DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS HOW HOW DID HOW DID THEY GET RIGHT NOW THE BEST SERVICE THAT THEY CAN TO KNOW WHAT IS OUT THERE AND AVAILABLE FOR THEM. THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION SO CARILLO YES IS MY UNDERSTANDING PROVIDES GRANTS TO LOCAL RESOURCES CHOPPY C. B. AND WE PROVIDE DIRECT REIMBURSEMENT FOR BILLS A FOR- EXPENSES RELATED TO A VIOLENT CRIME- AND AS WE HAVE NOTED THERE ARE MANY OTHER ENERGIES WITHOUT SWITCHING STATE GOVERNMENT THAT PROVIDE DIFFERENT SERVICES- SO WE'RE LOOKING AT ALL OF THAT IS TO UNDERSTAND HOW THEY MIGHT WORK BETTER TOGETHER- BUT OUR GOAL CERTAINLY IS JUNIOR- BUT TENSIONS NOW IN A SIMPLE EASY TO UNDERSTAND WAY. WHERE THEY CAN GET STATE RESOURCES. OKAY BUT RIGHT NOW HOW DO THEY NAVIGATE THOSE RESOURCES. SO INTERESTED IN RESOURCES FROM US STUDY- THAT CAN LEARN ABOUT US IN A LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS WE HAVE ENTITIES AND COUNTY OFFICES WE HAVE. EASY TO USE WEBSITE WHERE VICTIMS TRAPPED BY ONLINE FOR I SUBMIT AN APPLICATION AND WE ALSO WORK CLOSELY WITH MINE FOR SPENCER THAT THEY LEARN ABOUT OUR SERVICES. AND I DON'T I DON'T WANT TO SPEAK FOR CALAVERAS I DON'T KNOW THAT THEY GET DIRECTIONS THAT THEY HELP VICTIMS DIRECTLY OUT OF TRATTORIA. OKAY WELL. I THINK THEM I THINK WE NEED TO KNOW MUCH CLEARER MUCH CLEARLY MUCH MORE CLEARLY. OF THAT- THE VICTIMS WE CARE VERY MUCH I KNOW WE KNOW AS PART OF THE- JUSTICE. OF WORLD THAT IT IS NOT ONLY THOSE WHO- ARE SERVING TIME BUT THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE THE VICTIMS WE REALLY NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY KNOW. WHAT'S AVAILABLE TO THEM ONTO THE MAXIMUM AND- RIGHT NOW IT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE WE HAVE A VERY COORDINATED WAY OF GETTING THAT INFORMATION TO THEM. SO WOULD APPRECIATE THAT BEING WORKED ON MUCH MORE SERIOUSLY- COLLEAGUES.

PRIOR TO SB TWO HAS NOT BEEN REQUIRED OR PERMITTED TO COLLECT THE DATA LISTED IN THE LEGISLATION. TO COMPOUND THE ISSUE EACH STATE HANDLES THE CERTIFICATIONS DIFFERENTLY WITH THE BALKAN STATES PROCESSING REVOCATIONS BASED ON CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS. OR SUSTAINED INTERNAL INVESTIGATIONS. IN OTHER WORDS COMPARING DATA FROM OTHER STATES IS IN PERFECT. THUS WE UNDERSTAND THAT UNTIL WE HAVE DATA WE MUST BE OPEN TO MAKING ADJUSTMENTS.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR OF OTHERS THIS IS- QUITE AN UNDERTAKING. AND APPRECIATE ALL OF YOUR WORK FINANCE DO YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS. YES GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE ANY FRIENDS WITH THE PARTNER FINANCE- ALWAYS I WOULD ECHO ALL TRUCK- VERSUS POINTS- BUT TO RESPOND TO SOME OF THE ALLEY I WAS CONCERNED THAT ARE NOTED IN YOUR AGENDA- THE ADMINISTRATION IS NOT BELIEVE THAT THE ONE TIME SURGE- AS I MADE HIM TO REALISE AS THE ELLIE I DESCRIBE. FOR A COUPLE OF REASONS THE FIRST REASON BEING THAT- THE ISSUANCE OF THE PROOF OF ELIGIBILITY ON JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY THREE POSTS WILL BE ABLE TO ADDRESS AFTERWARD AUTOMATED PROCESS THEREFORE REDUCING THE IMPACTS OF POTENTIAL SURGE- THE SECOND PIECE RELATES TO THE REVIEWING OF THE RETROACTIVE REPORTS EXPECTED FOR ALLEGATIONS OF SERIOUS MISCONDUCT. THAT OCCURRED PRIOR TO JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY THREE. THESE REPORTS ARE NOT DUE TO POST- ARE THIS ARE THEY ARGUED OPPOSE STARTING ON JANUARY FIRST EIGHTY AND MUST BE SUBMITTED BY JULY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE. AND SO WHAT POST IS EXPECTING IS TO RECEIVED SOME REPORTS ON A FLOW BASIS STARTING ON JANUARY FIRST- BUT NOT ALL AT ONE TIME THERE FOR AGAIN- DIMINISHED SCENE- THE INSTANCE RESEARCH. AND THEREFORE WE'RE CONFIDENT POSSIBILITY TO ABSORB THIS WORKLOAD. WITH A STATUS PROPOSED BCK. THE SECOND OVERARCHING POINT IS THE L. A. WAS CAN. REGARDING PO HE TOOK PAINS STATUS. ALSO OPPOSES THAT WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN THIS SPACE. QUICKLY AND IT'S BEEN. WITH OUR PARTNER SERVICE- ANY. STUDIES THAT. TO BE EXTENDED TASTE POST LONGER TO OBTAIN THIS STAYS. CAN LEVERAGE SOME CREATIVE SOLUTIONS INCLUDING REPURPOSING EXISTING WORKSPACE- HOTEL AND CUBICLES. AND WEBER INTEL WORK TO ACCOMMODATE THE DISTRICT STAFF. AND LASTLY THAT THIRD POINT IS IN RESPONSE THE L. IS CONCERNED. ABOUT POSSIBILITIES YOU HIRE ON BOARD- THE HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN POSITIONS. BY JANUARY FIRST- WE KNOW THAT THIS IS A BIG CHALLENGE POST AGAIN HAS BEEN ENGAGING WITH KALINJAR- EARLY ON- TO DEVELOP SOME STRATEGIES. TO RECRUIT HIRE AND TRAIN THE NECESSARY STAFF- AGAINST INDIVIDUALS UNDERTAKING GIVEN THAT REPRESENTS A NEAR DOUBLING OF THE STAFF. BUT AGAIN POLICIES BE DOING- WORK ALREADY AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK DILIGENTLY. TO DO SO WITHOUT COMPLETE MY COMMENTS AND. ACCOUNTABLE FOR ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OF THE OF THE L. A. L. PLEASE MISS PETERS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I SO IT TO KIND OF TOUCH ON THE CONCERNS THAT MR FRIENDS AWAY AT ADAMS SORT OF SHOULD I TEACH THANK YOU FOR THAT. WE WANT TO FIRST KNOW THAT POST OFFICE MR ALVAREZ'S INDICATED HANSTEIN I'M REALLY ENCOURAGING AMOUNT OF WORK SHE COMPLIMENTS THIS NEW PROGRAM I'M IN A IN A VERY SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME. THEY HAPPEN THAT WAY ASK THAT OFFICIALS IN OTHER STATES WITH SIMILAR PROGRAMS AND REALLY DONE A LOT OF WORK IN THE CURRENT YEAR OR WITHOUT HAVING A SIGNIFICANT AUGMENTATION OF RESOURCES. IN ORDER TO GET THE PROGRAM TO STOP AND SO WE WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE THINK THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO OUT. WE DO RECOMMEND HAVING AT THE ADMINISTRATION SUBMIT A REVISED PROPOSAL FOR CLOSE RESOURCES TEMPLE MAY I SPEAK TO INTIMIDATE TO IDENTIFY AND ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED WITH THE PURPLE SOCKS. FIRST AS WAS ALLUDED TO- THE PROPOSAL DOES NOT ADDRESS FOR A SURGEON WORKLOAD SETTLE BEACH- STAFFING LEVELS THAT HAVE BEEN REQUESTED ARE REFLECTIVE OF THE ESTIMATES ONGOING WORKLOAD SHAUN BASED ON THOSE CONVERSATIONS THAT POSTERS HAVE WITH OTHER STATES AND THAT TYPE OF WORKLOAD IN SIMILAR PROGRAMS. ON AND THEN ADJUSTED INFORMED BY THE NUMBER OF AGENCIES AND OFFICERS IN CALIFORNIA. AND SO OBVIOUSLY IT WITH A NEW PROGRAM AND IT IS JUST AN ESTIMATE WE DON'T HAVE ANY ISSUES WITH THOSE I'M GOING ESTIMATES AT THIS TIME- BUT WHAT WE WOULD NOW AND AS I MISTER FRIENDS WE INDICATED. IS THAT- ALL RIGHT FOR ME AGENCIES IN THE STATE UNDER S. BEACH YOU WILL BE REQUIRED TO NOT ONLY REPORT ON DOWNEY ON ALLEGATIONS ASSIST SERIOUS MISCONDUCT BUT TO REPORT AND THREE YEARS OF PRIOR TO THAT ON ALLEGATIONS OF SERIOUS MISCONDUCT AND SO THOSE WILL START COMING IN JANUARY ONE. AND AGENCIES WILL HAVE AS WAS. INDICATED A SIX MONTHS TO PROVIDE. SO WITHIN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF THE- GOING WHAT THREE YEAR OF OUR- WILL BECOME TO COAST. FOR THEIR REVIEW AND THE TEN AND- IN ADDITION IT MAY. OF THE PUBLIC- OR EVEN UNDER HAS TWO BEGINNING JANUARY ONE OF NINETY YEAR. TO MAKE IT WORK. ALLEGATIONS OF SERIOUS MISCONDUCT IRAQ TO POWER. BOTH ON A ONGOING BASIS I WELL AS FOR. POTENTIAL PASSED SERIOUS MISCONDUCT THAT OCCURRED. IN OUR INNER STANDING ON THAT IS THAT'S NOT EVEN LIMITED TO THAT THREE YEAR ANY PAST SERVICE MISCONDUCT. FROM AN OFFICER. ON AND STILL NOT ACCOUNTING FOR THAT WORKLOAD AND ONLY BASING THE STAFFING REQUESTS ON. THE ON GOING WORKLOAD. THREE A CONCERN US. IN ADDITION- AS IN. WHAT CLOSE IS WORK ON OPTIONS STREAM D. ONE CERTIFICATION WORKLOAD ON THE LEGISLATURE IS GONNA WANT TO ENSURE THAT THAT TIME IS DONE IN A TIMELY MANNER AS WELL AS THERE ARE SEVERAL THOUSAND OFFICERS THAT ARE NOT CURRENTLY CERTIFIED BY POST I THAT WOULD NEED TO BE CERTIFIED BY JANUARY ONE OF THE NEXT YEAR WHEN THE PROGRAM SLASH. IN ADDITION WE FOUND THAT THERE ARE SOME POTENTIAL IMPLEMENTATION CHALLENGES WITH THE LEGISLATION AGAIN AT A POST IS VERY AWARE NEEDS AND SEEMS TO BE WORKING VERY DILIGENTLY TO ADDRESS THEM. NONE THE LAST WE THINK THAT EFFECTIVE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROGRAM WILL BE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO INSTILL PUBLIC TRUST IN THE NEW PROGRAM AND ENSURE THAT ALLEGATIONS OF MISCONDUCT ARE REVIEWED IN A TIMELY MANNER COMMENTS OF THE LEGISLATURE IS GONNA WANT TO. HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WE THINK ON HOW THESE IMPLEMENTATION CHALLENGES WILL BE ADDRESSED ON THE SPECIFIC CHALLENGES RELATE PRIMARILY AROUND THE NEED TO ROUGHLY DOUBLE THE SIZE OF STAFF STAFF WITHIN SIX MONTHS. AS MR OPERATES INDICATED HOWEVER- POST IS PLANNING A SOMEWHAT PHASED APPROACH TO HIRING THE STAFF I'M INCLUDING SOME OF THE STOCKS THAT ARE IDENTIFIED IN THE BUDGET PROPOSAL POTENTIALLY BEING HIRED IN THE CURRENT YEAR AS I BELIEVE TWICE- I'VE SPOKEN TO- AND MISTER ALVAREZ'S PRESENTATION AND AS WELL AS SOME OTHER INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE HEARD FROM POST THAT NOT ALL THE POSITIONS WILL NECESSARILY BE- ON BOARDED- WITHIN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF THE YEAR. I'M FROM THE TIME THE BUDGET PASSES TO WHEN THE PROGRAM GOES LIVE ON JANUARY ONE I'M AND WE WOULDN'T KNOW IF THAT THE. BUDGET PROPOSAL DOESN'T REFLECT THIS. APPROACH ON- UP THE- AND SO IT WILL REALLY BE ON FOR THE- UNDER THAT TIME AND NOT PLEASE APPROACH. AND HOW THAT ALIGN WITH THE X. WORKLOADS WILL BE CAN CAN MEAN AND I JANUARY ONE OF NEXT YEAR. IN ADDITION WILL COAST HAS REQUESTED FUNDING FOR AN IT SYSTEM AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT THEY HAVE BEEN WORKING DILIGENTLY. TO AND GET TO BE A FOUNDATION LAID FOR PROCURING AN EIGHTY SYSTEM QUICKLY. FROM THE POINTTHAT THE FUNDING IS PROVIDED IF THIS EASY PIZZA APPROVED- ON JULY ONE TO WIN THE SYSTEM WE NEED TO BE PROCURED AN OPERATIONAL COST ONLY HAVE SIX MONTHS WHICH FOR AN EIGHTY PROJECT IS. A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME AND SO THE LEGISLATURE IS GOING TO WANT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT CONTINGENCY PLANS POST HASN'T PLACED. FOR THAT IMPORTANT PIECE. THAT WAY THAT RELATE TO THE REPORTING INFORMATION FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES WE WOULD KNOW AND CREDIT HOST WITH ITS OXFORD STREET CREATIVE RECORDING. SYSTEM FOUR REPORTS COMING IN FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC THAT THEY'VE DEVELOPED IN HOUSE AND HAVE REACHED ALL. TIME WHICH IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE ANSWERED THE ENCOURAGING PROCESS THAT PROCESS PROGRESS THAT THEY HAVE MADE IN IMPLEMENTING THIS PROGRAM- AND THEN LASTLY IN TERMS OF IMPLEMENTATION CONCERNS- OFFICE SPACE WAS DISCUSSED- BY MISTER AUTHORIZED AND- THE PROPOSAL FOR YOU DOESN'T COULD FUNDING FOR OFFICE SPACE. HOWEVER IT'S BEEN NOTED TASK THAT IDG **** AND WORK POST IT COULD TAKE A YEAR OR MORE ACTUALLY WE ARE PRETTY SURE THE OFFICE SPACE AND SO POSTED ON OBVIOUSLY HAS BEEN THINKING ABOUT SOME CONTINGENCY PLANS FOR HOW TO STAFF NEED NEW PLEASE HOWEVER THE LEGISLATURE WE THINK IT'S GONNA WANT MORE INFORMATION ON THAT AND- BE ABLE TO DO SOME OVERSIGHT OF THAT. AND SO WE WOULD RECOMMEND HAVING SUBMIT REVISED PROPOSAL AT ANY REVISION TO ADDRESS BOTH THE US SEARCH AND WORKLOAD- AND ONE TIME WORKLOAD. AS WELL AS THE PHASING IN OF STAFF. AND ADDRESSING THESE IMPLEMENTATION CHALLENGES SO THAT THE LEGISLATURE CAN ENSURE THAT HOST. IS RECEIVING THE RIGHT WELL I SERVICES ON THE RIGHT LANE OF ENSURE. EMPLOYMENT OF THIS HAS A GOES LIVE NEXT YEAR. AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY THAT YOUNG. THANK YOU MISS PETERS- JUST BACK TO MISTER ALBERT IS THERE ANY THAT YOU WANT TO SEE AND WE- I KNOW THERE WERE. BECAUSE BY FINANCE BUT ANY THAT YOU TO ADD IN RESPONSE THE ALEJO. YES MA'AM I THINK IN TERMS OF TAKE A AT LEAST A SPACE ISSUE- FIRST OF ALL WE DID SOME RECONFIGURATION OF SPACE ISSUE OF OUR SPACE IN TWENTY TWENTY. TWENTY ONE- IT IS OCCUPIED SPACE FOR THE MOST PART WE HAD SOME TEMPORARY THE SB TWO TEAMS WORKING IN THAT SPACE WITH THE- OUR LIBRARY THAT WAS IN OUR BUILDING IN ADDED THIRTEEN CUBICLES FOR DOING ANOTHER RECONFIGURATION HEARING MARCH AS PART OF A- PLEASE HOLD. CAN IMPROVEMENTS ARE NEEDED LEASE IT'S GONNA. GIVE US ANOTHER TO- WORK SPACES I'VE COUNTED UP OUR OUR CUBICLE SPACES IF WE'RE FULLY STAFFED TODAY WE STILL HAVE AN ADDITIONAL THIRTY CUBICLES. TO TO. INCLUDE NEW- NEW EMPLOYEES INTO FOUR SP TWO ADDITIONALLY WE'RE ALSO WORKING TELEWORK AT PROGRAMS- WE'VE BEEN ON HYBRID TELEWORK SINCE SAID SINCE THE INCEPTION COBEN FACT FIRST YEAR EVERYBODY'S TELEWORKING WE CAN OBVIOUSLY. INCORPORATE THE EXISTING SPACE. COME TO SOME OF THE EXISTING SPACE USING A HYBRID TELEWORK MODEL SO THAT ALL PUPILS HER OUT ARE FULLY OCCUPIED SO THE SPACE CONCERNS ARE NOT. SIGNIFICANT ISSUE FOR ME PERSONALLY IN TERMS OF THE- THE SURGE OF RECORDING CELLS WILL LET ME TAKE THE PROOF OF ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE SET ON CLOTHES FOR JANUARY ONE WE'VE ANTICIPATED THAT THERE'S FOUR THOUSAND PROOF OF ELIGIBILITY CERTIFICATES THAT WE NEED TO ISSUE THOSE WILL ALL BE ISSUED AUTOMATICALLY- ON AUTOMATED. USING OUR AUTOMATED SYSTEM TO ISSUED AS PROOF OF ELIGIBILITY CERTIFICATIONS TO EXISTING EMPLOYEES DO NOT HAVE THEIR BASIC CERTIFICATE SO THAT IS ALREADY KIND OF IN THE WORKS DONE I MEAN IT'S REALLY JUST A MATTER OF- YOU KNOW DOING IT ON JANUARY ONE BASICALLY ALLOWING THE SYSTEM TO ISSUE DOES. IN TERMS OF THE WORKLOAD IN THE NEW INFORMATION COMING IN- FOR RETROACTIVE- REPORTING AND I WOULD LIKE OUR BUREAU CHIEF THANK JACQUI NELSON TO SPEAK TO THAT BUT IT IS GOING TO BE A PHASE DAY NOT A PHASED IN. I BELIEVE THE MR FRIENDS- YET TALK ABOUT A FLOW OF INFORMATION COMING AND WE DON'T ANTICIPATE THAT THAT INFORMATION IS ALL GOING TO. ARRIVE ON JANUARY ONE MAY HAVE A SIX MONTH REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AND THEN THERE ARE CERTAIN LIMITATIONS ON WHAT WE CAN DO WITH THAT RETROACTIVE INFORMATION THAT'S HOPEFULLY WHAT I. CAN LEAN ON- JACQUI TO SPEAK TO. IN TERMS OF THE- THE HIGHER- WE'RE GONNA TRY TO HIRE AS MANY PEOPLE AS WE POSSIBLY CAN- STARTING. AS SOON AS SAYS APRIL WE ALSO ANTICIPATE THAT THE DIVISIONS CAN BE STAFFED BY SOME EXISTING PERSONNEL WITHIN PULSE IT'S NOT ALL GOING TO BE BRAND NEW STATE EMPLOYEES OR NEW POST EMPLOYEES SOME OF THEM ARE GOING TO TRANSFER OVER FROM THE EXISTING POST POSITIONS. OBVIOUSLY THAT CREATES VACANCIES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HOUSE BUT WE DO FEEL THAT WE ARE POSITIONED IN A GOOD SPOT. TO BE READY ON JANUARY ONE WE ALSO WANT TO HAVE SOME FLEXIBILITY IN TERMS OF HOW WE HIRE- AND HOW MANY WE CAN HIRE HOPEFULLY WE'LL BE AHEAD OF THE- I HAD A SCHEDULE AND BE ABLE TO HIRE MORE THAN WE WOULD LIKE. BY JANUARY ONE. BUT WE DO WANT TO HAVE THAT FLEXIBILITY TO BE ABLE TO HIRE AS MANY AS POSSIBLE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. JACKIE FOR MAKING YOU.

WE WILL BE BRIEF AND WILL ADDRESS WILL BE DONE IN TERMS OF WELLNESS AND SECOND THE REASONS FOR THE RESOURCE REQUEST IN THIS B. C. P. OUR WAY OF BACKGROUND. AB EIGHT EIGHTEEN TWELVE IN JUNE OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN MANDATED POST CREATED INNOVATIONS GRANT PROGRAM. WHERE I. G. P. IN HOPES OF REDUCING OFFICER INVOLVED SHOOTINGS. AS PART OF THE IGP.

THE NEW BASIC TRAINING WHICH IS MANDATED FOR ALL DISPATCHERS WILL INCLUDE STANDARD CURRICULUM ON DISPATCHER WELLNESS. WE HOPE TO HAVE A DISPATCHER- BASICALLY HE ON COMPLETED BY THE END OF THIS YEAR WITH THE POINT SOMETIME IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE. STARTING A WELLNESS DISCUSSION AT THE BEGINNING OF A LAW ENFORCEMENT PROFESSIONALS CAREERS AN IMPORTANT EARLY STEP FOR THE INDIVIDUAL THE DEPARTMENT AND THEIR COMMUNITY. SUFFICE IT TO SAY FOR THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS WE'VE BEEN FOCUSED ON TRAINING DELIVERY. THEREFORE THIS VCP SHIFTS THE PRIMARY FOCUS TO DEPARTMENT SPECIFIC WELLNESS WORKSHOPS. EACH DEPARTMENT IS DIFFERENT IN TERMS OF THE WELLNESS ISSUES THEY FACE. SOME MAY FACE HIGH ON DUTY INJURIES SUICIDES LACK OF EFFECTIVE PEER SUPPORT IT CETERA ETCETERA. EACH DEPARTMENT IS DIFFERENT THUS THE DELIVERABLES OBJECTIVE OBJECTIVES AND OUTCOMES FOR EACH DEPARTMENT MUST BE TAILORED. HOUSE DESIRES TO PARTNER WITH ACADEMIA CLINICIANS AND EXPERTS IN THE AREA OF WELLNESS TO WORK WITH INDIVIDUAL LINE FOR STATE DEPARTMENTS TO CREATE OR IMPROVE HAVE. BY LEVERAGING THE PARTNERSHIPS WITH ACADEMIA CLINICIANS IN THE EXPERTS CLOSE WILL EVALUATE THE ISSUES THE DELIVERABLES THE FOLLOW THROUGH AND THE OUTCOMES FOR EACH DEPARTMENT PROJECT. WE ARE CONFIDENT LAW ENFORCEMENT PROFESSIONALS WERE EMOTIONALLY AND PHYSICALLY HEALTHY NOT ONLY HELP THEMSELVES IN THEIR DEPARTMENT. BUT BUT OUR IS BETTER SERVICE TO THEIR COMMUNITY. STUDIES HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT TO BE TRUE AND WE CAN GO INTO SOME OF THOSE STUDIES IF YOU'D LIKE. THEREFORE THIS B. C. P. ADDRESSES THE CONTINUE DELIVERY OF TRAINING. PERMITS THE STATE A LEADERSHIP ROLE TO WORK WITH INDIVIDUAL DEPARTMENTS. TO FURTHER THEIR INDIVIDUAL WELLNESS JACKETS. THAT MADAM CHAIR WE THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING US TO TESTIFY TO YOUR COMMITTEE WE STAND READY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU MISTER OVER IS- WITH FINANCE LIKE TO MAKE ANY COMMENTS. YES MANAGER ANYTHING FRIENDS OR CORPORATE FINANCE AGAIN- AGAIN TO PRACTICE SOME OF THE L. A. AS CONCERNS THAT MISS PETERS WILL SPEAK TO THE MINISTRATION BELIEVES HE PROPOSED PROGRAM HAS VERY SPECIFIC GOALS WHICH INCLUDE SUPPORTING LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES BUILDING THEIR CAPACITY TO OFFER BOTH INDIVIDUAL LEVEL AN ORGANIZATIONAL. WELLNESS PROGRAMMING- ONE OF THE PRIMARY WAYS POST WILL DO THIS IS BY HOSTING AGENCY BONUS WORKSHOPS OVER THREE CONSECUTIVE FISCAL YEARS- IN ADDITION TO YOU ABSOLUTELY SOLICITING THE CREATION OF WELLNESS RELATED RESOURCES AND MULTIMEDIA AGGREGATED AND DISSEMINATING BEST PRACTICES FOR WELLNESS AND WORKING WITH PARTNERS IN ACADEMIA TO EVALUATE- OR DID YOU VALUATIONS THAT CAN SUPPORT THE IDENTIFICATION OF BEST PRACTICES. WE BELIEVE POST IS UNIQUELY POSITIONED AND ASKING SITE INTO LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY OPERATIONS AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH WELL THIS IS HANDLED WITHIN THOSE AGENCIES AND AS DIRECTOR ALVAREZ NOBODY KNOWS HOW TO IDENTFY THAT THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT GAP AMONG AGENCIES PERTAINS TO OFFEREE AGAIN THIS INDIVIDUAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL WELLNESS PROGRAMMING AND THAT'S WHAT THIS. PROGRAM IS INTENDED TO ADDRESS- MINISTRY I'VE ALSO NOTED IS HAPPY TO PROVIDE I DO INFORMATION JUST. TO THE L. A. AND ALLEGE. NECESSARY HOWEVER THE INTENT IS TO GIVE POST THE FLEXIBILITY IN DELIVERING THIS PROGRAM DUE TO THE KIND OF A WIDE VARIETY OF. SIZE AND CAPACITY- GEOGRAPHIC NEEDS UP TO ONE COURSE AGENCIES ACROSS THE STATE. AND I WOULD LAST WE KNOW IN THIS TIES INTO YOU ARE THE PREVIOUS PROPOSAL WITH SB TWO BY THE L. A. R. TO CONCERNED ABOUT IMPLEMENTATION AS IT RELATES TO KIND OF DOING THIS PROGRAM. SB TWO AT THE SAME TIME AGAIN WE BELIEVE POETAS OF STANGEL EXPERIENCED IN THIS TYPE OF PROGRAM DELIVERY AGAIN A STRONG RECORD OFFERS A SPOKEN TO- ENABLE ALSO BE DIFFERENT STAFF WHO WERE WORKING ON A SPEECH YOU IN DIFFERENT STAFF WERE WORKING. OFFICER WELL SO ALTHOUGH SB TWO APPLICATIONS CRITICAL AND THAT WILL BE A CENTRAL FOCUS- POST DOES HAVE THE CAPACITY AND THE ABILITY TO WORK UP THE SAME TIME AND I'LL CONCLUDE. MY COMMENTS THANK YOU. HANK YOU VERY MUCH- WE TURN TO OUR L. A- PLEASE. SPEAKING MEDICARE DISTRIBUTORS WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AGAIN SH SO I THINK THE WE THINK THE OVERALL CONCEPT AS FOCUSING ON OFFICER WELLNESS HAS MERIT- OFFICER WELLNESS IS IMPORTANT AND IT'S IMPORTANT FOR OFFICERS TO BE ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY. ADMINISTER THEIR DUTIES AND DE ESCALATE DANGEROUS SITUATION SENSE OF THE OVERALL CONCEPT HAS NEAR H. AND HOWEVER THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AND THAT DOESN'T INCLUDE SOME OF THE DETAILS THAT WE WOULD AYE THAT TYPICALLY I LIKE TO SEE IT FOR A PROPOSAL THAT COULD REALLY DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THE PROPOSED PROGRAM WOULD ACTUALLY IMPROVE OFFICER WELLNESS. AND IN PARTICULAR WE FIND THAT THERE'S A NUMBER OF UNANSWERED QUESTIONS REGARDING THE PROPOSAL. AND AS WAS MENTIONED THERE IS A VARIETY OF ACTIVITIES THAT WOULD BE UNDERTAKEN THE PROPOSAL DOES NOT AND IDENTIFY. HOW MUCH FUNDING WOULD BE ALLOCATED TO THE DIFFERENT ACTIVITIES- NEED SPECIFIC PRIMARY GOALS OF THE PROGRAM ARE NOT IDENTIFIED AS WAS ALLUDED TO THERE IS A HIGH LEVEL GOALS IN TERMS OF IMPROVING INDIVIDUAL OFFICER WELLNESS IMPROVING ORGANIZATIONAL WELLNESS FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AND EVEN I'M IMPROVING I'M COMMUNITY WHILE LAST OUT WITH REGARDS TO LAW ENFORCEMENT- AND WHILE ALL OF THOSE ARE IMPORTANT. AND THAT WITHOUT A SPECIFIC ASSESSMENT OF. WHAT GOALS WOULD BE TARGETED WITH THE SCIENCES DIFFICULT FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO EVALUATE THE MERITS OF THE PROGRAM- IN ADDITION WE FIND THAT ADMINISTRATION HAS NOT ANSWERED THE QUESTION- SPECIFICALLY IN TERMS OF THE PROBLEMS THAT WOULD BE SOLVED. WITH THESE FINE SIDE THERE HAS NOT BEEN AN ASSESSMENT OF SPECIFIC GAPS OR WEAKNESSES IN EXISTING LINE FIRST MEANT WELLNESS PROGRAMS- AND WHAT SHOULD BE IMPORTANT. FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO NOW IN TERMS OF HOW THESE WERE ACT. MAYBE ALLOCATED TO SPECIFIC ACTIVE AND WHETHER THE DUST ACT- OR THE MOST AFFECT ONES CHU I THE- AND IDENTIFY THIS ACTIVITIES THAT WOULD BE FUNDED AND WE CAN SUPPORT FOR THE LEAD. TO KNOW APPROVING ANY FOR I AND ITS BANKS WHAT WOULD BE EXPECTED WITH THE SPARTANS I'M SUCH AS A MEASURABLE METRICS ON IMPROVEMENT IN OFFICER WELLNESS OR EVEN THE NUMBER OF OFFICERS THAT WOULD BE SERVICE THROUGH THESE PROGRAMS- I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW HOW THE ADMINISTRATION HAS INDICATED THAT- WELL THE PROPOSAL DOESN'T SAY IT'S LIKELY THAT POST WHICH USED TO PROVIDE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF THE SPENDING INTO THE OFFICER WELLNESS WORKSHOPS THAT IT PLANS TO DEMOLISH. I OUR OFFICE IS BEEN TOLD THAT I HAD THIS LEVEL OF FUNDING COULD SUPPORT ROUGHLY THIRTY FIVE OF THESE OFFICER WELLNESS WORKSHOPS AT THIRTY FIVE ONE PERSON AGENCIES WITH OVER SIX HUNDRED A LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES IN THE STATE- UNDERSTANDING THOSE OUTCOMES AND HOW FUNDS WILL BE ALLOCATED IS IMPORTANT SINCE OBVIOUSLY THIS WOULD NOT PROVIDE ENOUGH FUNDING FOR THIRTY FIVE WORKSHOPS TO COVER ALL SIX HUNDRED. LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES IN THE STATE- AND TO THE EXTENT HOUSE HAS A PLAN TO DO THAT UNDERSTANDING THE DETAILS OF THAT WOULD BE IMPORTANT FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO GET A SENSE AS TO HOW MANY OFFICERS WOULD BE SERVED THROUGH THE PROGRAM. AND IN TERMS AS- THIS. THIS PER WE HAVE BEEN THAT COSTA IT WILL TAKE ROUGHLY A- TO DEVOUR THE- OF THIS CAR. AND PER I HAD TO TAPES OF THE THAT WE THINK LEGISLATURE I WOULD WANT TO KNOW BEFORE APPROVING SPENDING- AND IF. IF IT WOULD TAKE THAT LONG TO DEVELOP THE PROGRAM SHE DOES RAISE A QUESTION ABOUT TO WHAT EXTENT SHOULD HAVE HOST COULD HANDLE DEVELOPING THIS NEW PROGRAM AT THE SAME TIME THAT THEY ARE ROLLING OUT THE VERY SIGNIFICANT EFFORTS TO. IMPLEMENT SB TO WHICH AS WHAT IS SPOKEN TO EARLIER OR MIGHT IT MINISTRATION IS REQUIRING REDIRECTING SOME OF THE EXISTING STOCK OF OTHER AN EXISTING PROGRAMS. TO THAT EFFORT AND SO JUST GIVEN THE MAGNITUDE OF ASK YOU TO IMPLEMENTATION AS WELL AS. THIS PROPOSAL NOT. DURING A HERE TO BE TO. WE CAN THAT REYES ACROSS FOR THE JUST A IN TERMS OF. HOW THEY TO MIGHT FACTORY ANOTHER- SO IN TERMS OF OUR- WE WOULDN'T THAT YOU DIRECT CLOSE TO PROVIDE A GREATER LEVEL OF DETAIL AND MARK PERMISSION TO ANSWER THESE KEY QUESTIONS THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED. TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU RECEIVE INFORMATION THAT YOU FELT JUSTIFIES THE PROGRAM HAND CAN SUPPORT THE LEGISLATURE SCHOOLS FOR OFFICER WELLNESS OUT THEN WE WOULD RECOMMEND YOU APPROVE THE PROPOSAL. TO THE EXTENT THAT TIME IT DOES TAKE HOST A LONGER AMOUNT OF TIME AS WELL AS I NATIONALLY INDICATED TO OUR OFFICE TO PROVIDE THOSE DETAILS OF THEIR UNABLE TO PROVIDE THEM FOR THE DETAILS DON'T. ON ADEQUATELY ALIGNED WITH THE LEGISLATURE SCHOOLS- AND THEN WE WOULD RECOMMEND THAT YOU REJECT THE PROGRAM WITHOUT PREJUDICE. SO THAT HOST HAS MORE TIME TO DEVELOP THE PROGRAM I COULD BRING A PROPOSAL FORWARD I CAN THE NEXT BUDGET YEAR AND I'M. HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS PETERS- APPRECIATE THAT CALL AND OKAY GREAT WELL- MISTER LEWIS THANK YOU VERY MUCH- FOR YOU AND YOUR DEPARTMENT. THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT AS- SOME WAYS JUST AS IMPORTANT AS SB TWO IN A DIFFERENT WAY IT ARE REALLY IMPORTANT- THAT WE MOVE FOR WITH THE RESOURCES THAT ARE NEEDED FOR. THE WELLNESS OF OUR OFFICERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE SO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ALL THAT YOU'RE DOING AND- OBVIOUSLY THERE IS ISSUES RAISED BY THE LA- THAT WE ARE- YOU KNOW- SUPPORTIVE OF. AND LOOK FORWARD TO MORE INFORMATION IN THE FUTURE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH EVERYONE WE'RE MOVING ON NOW TO- ISSUE THIRTEEN I THINK IT'S OUR LAST ISSUE.

FUNDING FOR INDIGENT DEFENSE. SHORTY OF. DEFENSE FROM THIS THE FIRST TIME THEY EVER. STATE FUNDING. AND THE FIRST TIME THEY ARE. FOR A- ANY. SO ONE OF THE EARLY TWO. THAT THIS GRANT PROGRAM. WITH THAT YES SEE NOT HAVE A- WITH INDIGENT DEFENSE. AND THIS. DID NOT HAVE A WITH RAP. SHE SO AS A RESULT I'M- MY- DIVISION I TOOK A SOME OF THE- LIFTING AND IT OF THE MEETING OUT OF REACH THE GRAPH. WE DID. WEBINARS ASSEMBLY THE APPLE. OPEN ABOUT THE FROM AND THE PROCESS TRYING TO REACH INDIGENT DEFENSE PROVIDERS IN EVERY COUNTY TO ALERT THEM OF THE OPPORTUNITY. AND GIVE THEM THE CHANCE TO START THINKING ABOUT HOW THEY WOULD DESIGN THEIR FUNDING. AND THE GRANT APPLICATION. HOW DO WITHOUT DEFENDER. WERE PRETTY HARD TO REACH AND ULTIMATELY APPLIED IN MUCH SMALLER NUMBERS. BUT WE RECEIVED FEEDBACK THAT ALL SPD SEMINARS ARE A WARM VITALLY IMPORTANT IN GETTING PEOPLE TO APPLY. APPLICATION PROCESS OPENED. AGAIN OUR DIVISION OFFERS YES ON SUPPORT TO INDIGENT DEFENSE PROVIDERS IN THE GRANT PROCESS WHILE WE DID WORK CONSISTENTLY WITH THE BIG OFFICES BUT THE BIG COUNTIES. I SPENT MOST OF MY TIME WITH SMALL OR RURAL CHINESE WHERE THE RESOURCES ARE PARTICULARLY STRETCHED AND INDIGENT DEFENSE PROVIDERS FELT OVERWHELMED BY THE BSP SEEK PROCESS. BUT OF COURSE WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY WERE SO OVERWHELMED BY THE FCC PROCESS THAT THEY DIDN'T APPLY FOR THE FUN. WE ALSO WORK WITH THE SEC HAN RANT AND EVALUATIONS. BRINGING OUR EXPERTISE ON INDIGENT DEFENSE SYSTEM. WHAT WE LEARNED IN THIS PROCESS IS THAT THE STANDARD PSEC MODEL OF JUST PUTTING UP A NOTICE ON THE WEBSITE AND SENDING OUT A MASS EMAIL AND SEEN WHAT PRIZE BY THE DEADLINE. DOES NOT WORK FOR INDIGENT DEFENSE GRANTS TO ENSURE EQUITY ACROSS THE STATE THESE GRANT PROGRAMS REQUIRE. AND RELATIONSHIP BUILDING AND UNDERSTANDING OF THE COMPLEXITIES OF THE SUBJECT MATTER AND MEANINGFUL HANDS. ON ASSISTANCE TO THESE PROVIDERS. I'M IT MY DIVISION WAS PRETTY BOTH FOR THIS WORK AND WE REALLY LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING FUTURE OPPORTUNITIES. TO BUILD ON WHAT WE LEARNED AND I'M ON THIS PROCESS. I AM PROUD TO REPORT THAT OF THE FORTY NINE AND A HALF MILLION THAT WAS AVAILABLE TO BE ALLOCATED OVER FORTY SEVEN MILLION HAVE BEEN APPLIED FOR. I'M WE DO SEE ALWAYS SPEEDY DOES SEE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR AT LEAST ANOTHER MILLION TO BE APPLIED FOR AND WE'VE ASKED THE SEC TO RE OPEN APPLICATION PERIOD FOR THAT PURPOSE. WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK. WITH INDIGENT DEFENSE PROVIDERS AS THEY START GETTING THEIR FUNDING HOPEFULLY IN MARCH ADD TO THE INDIGENT DEFENSE IMPROVEMENT DIVISION IS PLANNING A SERIES OF TRAINING FOR THE NEW STAFF BACKED OUT. WILL BE HIRED WITH THIS GRANT FUNDING. I'LL JUST SAY THAT IN A TO WORK ON THE GRANT PROGRAM CONTINUE TO PROVIDE FREE HIGH QUALITY TRAININGS ON CHANGES TO THE LAW.
