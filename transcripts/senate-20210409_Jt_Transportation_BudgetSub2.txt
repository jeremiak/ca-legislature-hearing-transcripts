WE'VE SPENT LOTS OF MONEY. ON DESERVE AND RE YEARS. BUT WE'RE STILL ALL WAY. FROM ARTICLE ARE. IN THE WHITE PAPER THAT PREPARE AND A FOR THE- PAST SPENDING HAS BEEN. ACROSS MULTIPLE PROGRAMS WITH LITTLE COORDINATION BETWEEN THEM AND NOW WE HAVE ANOTHER SERIES OF OTHER PROGRAMS THAT WE WANT TO DO SO ALL OF THIS RAISES THE QUESTION. AND I THROW THIS OUT TO GO PEE IS ED THE NATURAL RESOURCES. OF THE LISTENING CAREFULLY WHAT IS THE STRATEGY. HOW ARE WE GOING TO FOCUS OUR EFFORTS AND PUT THE RESOURCES OF THE STATE TO BUILD ON THE SUCCESSES THAT WE HAVE ON THE PAST.

IT'S A FOR AFTER I'M ALL YEAR. I WANT TO GET A AND- OF WHAT THIS IS NOT A- OVERALL. HOW WE CUORE YOU A LOT OF. BUT HOW YOU CLEAR THAT. AND HOW WE'RE ACT. IN FOR. COULD MOVE THE NEEDLE AND MORE A- AS- AND THEN PARTICULAR. WHAT ELSE DO YOU WANT FOR THE LEGIS. BECAUSE WE ARE PART. IN THIS TO REACH THE GOALS. AND THERE'S BEEN. A SERIES. OF ADMINISTRATOR EXECUTIVE ORDERS AND I'M REMINDED OF LYNDON BAINES JOHNSON'S WATCHING SOMETHING ON PUBLIC RADIO AND HE SAID WHEN HE WAS CONSIDERING THE CIVIL RIGHTS WORK IT'S JUST PAPER. YOU KNOW WHETHER IT'S GOVERNOR SCHWARZENEGGER GOVERNOR BROWN THE GOVERNOR NEWSOM AN EXECUTIVE ORDER IS JUST PAPER AND WE'RE WOEFULLY BEHIND ON THE LOFTY GOALS THE PEOPLE HAVE SAID SO. MANAGER I AM DELIGHTED TO BE HERE TO BE ALL EARS TO LISTEN TO WHAT. THE NATURAL RESOURCES. THE HAS AND AS WE AS THE GO IS AND HOW THIS MOVES. CAN COME IN A COURT. AND UNDER. PLAN BUT DON'T YOU THINK. WELL I KNOW THAT WE GET TO DAYS. AND TO. MAN ABSTRACTIONS TO DON'T UNDER WHAT THE INCENTIVE IS WE'RE WE'RE SO WITH THAT LOOK FOR TO OUR FOR WITNESS THANK YOU SENATOR RECOUNTS WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A GOOD MEET I KNOW- AND WE ARE HAVE SAID ARCHERS WHO IS HERE AT HE'S ALSO SEE SENATOR STERN WHO IS PART. WITH AS WELL WELCOME- SO BEFORE WE BEGIN AGAIN WITH OUR SPEAKERS I'D LIKE TO IT ONCE AGAIN INVITE THE PUBLIC WOULD LIKE TO PARTICIPATE TO CALL AND NOW ONCE AGAIN THE TOLL FREE NUMBER IS EIGHT FOUR FOUR. TWO NINE ONE SIX THREE SIX FOUR WHEN PROMPTED PLEASE USE ACCESS CODE SEVEN THREE SIX TWO EIGT THREE ONE. NOW WE WILL HEAR FROM OUR FIRST PANEL EACH PANELIST WILL HAVE A FEW MINUTES WE SHOULD CONCLUDE AT THIS PANEL IN ABOUT THIRTY MINUTES THE FIRST PERSON I ON OUR DOCKET IS ROSS BROWN WITH THE L. A. O. LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. WE WILL THEN HAVE SIMON SIMON WEEK- AND CHECK SHE LUCK WITH TO A CONSULTING BUT FIRST WE'LL HEAR FROM ROTH BROWN MISTER GO RIGHT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MISTER SHE- I'M- AGAIN ROSS BROWN WITH THE LETTER. PANEL OFFICE. NAY HAVE A- RISK PRISON. TO SHARE HERE JUST FEW SLOW. SO I'M GOING TO. HOLD UP. HOPEFULLY YOU CAN SEE THAT PLEASE LET ME KNOW- IF YOU CAN'T SEE IT- BUT I'M NOT TAKE MY TIME I KNOW YOU ARE A FULL A HERE SOME DISCO TAKE A FEW MINUTES AND MOST. I JUST CRIED SOME BACK ON INFORMATION AND CONTACT TO KIND OF STOP THIS FOR A HEARING TO. AND YOUR- I'M GOING TO SAY ARE THESE ISSUES. SO I GOING TO JUMP RIGHT AND. FOR SOME REASON WE'RE THERE WE GO. GO TO THE- FIGURE AND THIS IS REALLY A BIG STEP BACK. TO BIG PICTURE. HONEST GREENHOUSE GAS SCHOOL- YOU CAN SEE- VOLUSIA AREA HERE AS I. GREENHOUSE GAS IN. SINCE TWO SO. AND THEN THE STATE'S. I STARTED GREENHOUSE GAS ARE THE TO TWENTY TRI IS THAT DOCUMENT IN THE TWENTY THIRD TARGET ON THE RIGHT. YOU CAN SEE ACTUAL MISSION ARE THE CAR SINCE TWO THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED TWO IS A- AND WE'VE ACTUALLY. MY THESE WHY GOALS YEARS EARLY SO THAT'S ONE- KEEP. AND THAT'S A BIG. BUT I THINK REALLY KIND OF THE OTHER KEY POINTS FROM CHART. IF YOU LOOK AT THE TWENTY THIRTY TARGET- THAT GOAL IS MORE IN. THAN TWENTY TWO TARGET. ADJUSTING SHARE KIND OF GONNA TURN IT'S- ABOUT ONE FOR. ANNUAL RETURN NEED TO MEET THE TWENTY TWO TARGET- THE ANNUAL. NAY TO MEET THE THIRD TARGET ARE CLOSE 24% SO THAT'S A BIG DIFFERENCE IN TERMS OF- AMBITION- THEN THE OTHER THING I JUST WANNA HIGHLIGHT IN THIS. IS THIS. ERROR HAS ACTUALLY BEEN A SLIGHT UPTICK OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS OVERALL. SO MOVING ON TO THE SECOND CHART HERE AND THIS IS REALLY JUST GOING TO GIVE THE CONTEXT OF WHERE TRANSPORTATION FITS IN ON BOTH GREENHOUSE GASES AS WELL AS- OTHER POLLUTANTS FOUND A CHART ON THE- CHART ON THE RIGHT IS NITROUS OXIDES CONTRIBUTORS TO. A SMOG AND OZONE SO TRANSPORTATION AS SENATOR WHITEHOUSE YOU MENTIONED IS- 40% THOSE ARE THE DARK BLUE SHADED PARTS OF THE GREENHOUSE GAS CHART SO IT'S ABOUT 40% OF GREENHOUSE GASES- BUT ON THE NITROUS OXIDES ON THE LOCAL AIR POLLUTION TRANSPORTATION REFLECTS ABOUT CONTRIBUTING. TO- TO SMOG. SO- BIG CHUNK OF BOTH BUT I TRANSFERRED IT IS IT IS KIND OF ANY BERMAN BIGGER OR OF LOCAL AIR POLLUTION. I ONE OTHER THING I DO WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT THIS CHART- FOR THE GREENHOUSE GAS. THE TRANSFER TRONG THE PIECE OF THAT LIGHT DUTY VEHICLES WHICH IS BIGGER THAN. HEAVY DUTY OFF ROAD A MEDIUM DUTY- BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE NITROUS I. ON THE- IT'S KIND OF FOR AS AN OFF AND HAVE DUTY THE ARE LARGER CHUNK OF THE EMISSION FIGURE FROM DUTY BE SO. TO SUPPORT KIND SOMETHING ABOUT OF HOW YOU PRICE- AND ENTER POLICY ARE BASED ON A CLINICAL AS WELL LOCAL GOALS. THIS NEXT. BUT I DO THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT AND THOSE GIRLS ARE STARTING EXECUTIVE ORDER ORDERS AGAIN AS AS SENATOR WHAT KASKY. MENTIONED THERE NOT A STATUTORY GOALS- BUT THIS CHART REALLY KIND OF- ZEROS IN ON THE ONE OF THE MORE RECENT GOALS ESTABLISHED BY THE GOVERNOR ON LIGHT DUTY VEHICLE SALES AND KINDA THIS HOPEFULLY GIVES YOU A SENSE OF. THE SCALE OF THE- OF THE TRANSITION IS NEEDED TO MEET THAT GOAL WHICH IS A 100% DOWN SALES FOR LIGHT DUTY VEHICLES BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE. YOU CAN SEE- THIS EXAMPLE CHART FROM CARB- IN TWENTY TWENTY WERE ATABOUT 80% OF LIGHT DUTY. VEHICLE SALES ANNUAL VEHICLE SALES ARE DESERVES AND THIS IS THE KIND OF THE TYPE OF TRANSITION THAT WILL NEED. TO SEE- 100% ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE SALES BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE SO IT'S A- IT'S. A BIG SHIFT THAT THAT WILL BE NEEDED. AND THE FINAL CHARGE- HERE BOTH I CAN- OF WRAPPED UP IN- OFFER DISTRICT OF BRIEF COMPANY. I DON'T. THE WORD AT THE MISS. YEAH I THINK NOT ON. SORRY MR SHOULD I WORRY I'M GOING SENATOR RUBIO. JUSTTRYING A SHE BASICALLY SAID- RIGHT AHEAD I THINK WE'VE- PERHAPS MUTED THE PERSON OR- HAVE THAT FIGURED OUT SO RIGHT WHEN YOU GO AHEAD AND- OKAY GREAT RECEIVE THANK YOU SO. LAST CHART HERE NOT APOLOGIZE THIS IS BIT OF A CHART WAS JUST PULLED- WE DID A COUPLE OF AGO- AND THE DIZZINESS MAYBE IS PARTLY TO POINT IS KIND OF. TRYING TO- SOME. THE STATE PRO THAT WE HAVE THOSE THAT ARE TRANSFER. EMISSIONS AND IN PARTICULARLY. PROGRAMS THAT ARE AIMED AT PROVIDING FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR- VEHICLES AND FUELING INFRASTRUCTURE AND INCENTIVES TO. TO PROMOTE CLEANER- CLEANER VEHICLES AND INFRASTRUCTURE AND SO THIS IS NOT- ZAB SPECIFIC THERE ARE PROGRAMS THAT ARE ON THIS CHART THAT INCLUDES- JUST KIND OF VEHICLE REPLACEMENT AND UPGRADES SO THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY AS I'M SPECIFIC BUT I THINK. THE IDEA IS JUST GOING TO GIVE YOU A SENSE FOR ALL THE DIFFERENT STATE PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE THAT PROVIDE. FINANCIAL INCENTIVES FOR VEHICLES AND FEELING AFTER STRUCTURE IS ALSO DOES NOT INCLUDE- THINGS THAT ARE FOCUSED POLICIES ARE FOCUSED ON VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED SO YOU KNOW TRANSIT LATER ACTIVITIES FOR EXAMPLE ARE NOT ON HERE- DOESN'T INCLUDE- MANY REGULATORY PROGRAMS AT THE STATE HOUSE AS WELL- BUT I THINK YOU CAN KIND OF SEE- THE LONG LIST OF PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE CHART HERE. RANGING FROM THE LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD WHICH IS A REGULATORY PROGRAM BUT IT ESSENTIALLY GOING TO PROVIDE FINANCIAL INCENTIVES FOR ZERO EMISSION. VEHICLES WE HAVE A VARIETY OF PROGRAMS AT THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD ON THE LIGHT DUTY HEAVY DUTY AND EQUITY- PROGRAM SIDE OF THINGS- RADIOS AND YOU HEAR FROM A LOT OF THE- THAT ARE. THESE PROGRAMS- LATER IN THE YEAR. THE FINAL THING WANT TO KIND OF HIGH IS NOT CALL HERE WE HAVE TO FUNDING SOURCES THAT SUPPORT ALL OF THESE ARE PROGRAMS AT THE STATE HAS RANGING FROM AGAIN LCS US- CREDIT REVENUE WHICH IS A REGULATORY PROGRAM DOESN'T. RUN THROUGH THE. STATE BUDGET BUT ALSO AS NO G. R. S. I'LL BE RIGHT THERE FOR. LEGAL ON- AND- REVENUE SOURCES. AND WHEN GOT OUT ALL THE UP- IN RECENT YEARS IT'S ROUGHLY BILLION DOLLARS HAS GONE TO. ME FRANCE. PROGRAMS AGAIN NOT ALL OF. A SPECIFIC FOR IS A BUT JUST GONNA GIVES YOU HOPE A- BIT OF SENSE OF THE LANDSCAPE OF THE Y. VARIETY OF PROGRAMS THE STATE HOUSE NECESSARY- I DON'T. PROBABLY GOING TO BRING UP AGAINST MY TO HERE I DO JUST TO HIGHLIGHT. A DISTRICT COUPLE OF COMMON AND SHIP COUPLE OF QUESTIONS THAT CAN AS YOU- ENGAGING YOUR HEARING TO AND I'M GOING. A COUPLE SEEK. THAT WE CURRENT I THINK IT ONE OF- JUST OF THE LEAD. ONE TO BE IN A ZERO B. O. GOALS I MENTIONED YOUR THE GOVERNOR. HOW HOW WOULD IT LIKE TO BALANCE REGULATORY PROGRAMS VERSUS INCENTIVE PROGRAMS BOTH- CAN HELP ACHIEVE A LOT OF THESE GOALS AND HOW HEAVILY DOES THE LEGISLATURE WANT TO FOCUS ON. ON FINANCIAL INCENTIVES VERSUS REGULATIONS AND HAVE IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS FOR WHO BEARS THE COST OF MEETING SOME OF THESE GOALS FOR EXAMPLE- AND THEN FINALLY- AND ISSUE THAT COMES UP AND HAS COME UP IN SOME OF THE BUDGET DISCUSSIONS AND THERE HAS BEEN A QUESTION FOR A WHILE NOW IS. A FOUR ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE INCENTIVES HOW MUCH EMPHASIS TO PLACE ON THE VEHICLES- AND HOW MUCH OF PLACE ON THE FUELING INFRASTRUCTURE- AND THAT'S A- DIFFICULT QUESTION IN THE MINISTRATION MY DISCUSS IT'S- A PROPOSED BUDGET FOR THIS YEAR- WHICH- PLACES SOME OF AN EMPHASIS ON FUELING. INFRASTRUCTURE AS PART OF THAT DISCUSSION AND WE THINK THAT'S- REASONABLE BUT THERE ARE IMPORTANT QUESTIONS ABOUT TENANTS YOU KNOW HOW. HOW THE LEGISLATURE WOULD LIKE TO EMPHASIZE VEHICLES AND FUELING INFRASTRUCTURE BOTH CAN BE ATTRACTIVE WAYS TO PROMOTE JOBS- BUT IF YOU HAVE LIMITED FUNDING- HOW DO YOU KIND OF- PRIORITIZE YOUR HOW MUCH EMPHASIS DO YOU PLACE ON EACH ONE OF THOSE GOALS. SO IN THE INTEREST OF TIME I WILL WRAP UP MY COMMENTS AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU KNOW. THANK YOU MISTER BROWN AND MEMBERS ARE GOING TO TAKE QUESTIONS AFTER THIS PANEL- SO NEXT WE HAVE DEPUTY DIRECTOR SIMON WE- CLEAN VEHICLES AND FUELS GROUP CLIMATE AND CLEAN ENERGY PROGRAM- FROM THE NATURAL. RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL. GO RIGHT AHEAD MISTER. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU MISTER MEMBERS OF THAT THE COMMISSION- SO I ASKED- AS AS. ACTOR AND FOR NATURAL RESOURCES COUNCIL REPRESENTS A BUNCH. AND A LITTLE RESEARCH. THAT WE CAN GET. WITH I SURE LOCK AND IN ENSURE. AND ENTERTAINING CONSULTING IS ALSO ON THE SCENE MEETING. HELP ANSWER ADDITIONAL. FACING WE LOOKED. HOW INCENTIVES INTO THE WORLD OF RENT. AND INFRASTRUCTURE AND BASS AND REALLY AT A HIGH LEVEL WHAT THE SCHOOLS. ACTUALLY FOR THE STATE IN TERMS OUT THE ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES. IN MY ACROSS THE STATE- AS AS INTERNET. ON CLEAN VEHICLES FUELS. I GENERALLY THREE CAPITA A POLICY THAT ARE UTILIZED BY. TO REALLY- OVERCOME THE BARRIER TO THE EMISSION. THESE INCLUDE FIRST REGULATIONS LIKE THE ONES WE HAVE HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND CLEAN CAR STANDARDS. REALLY ARE FOCUSED ON INCREASING THE SUPPLY AND AVAILABILITY AND ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE TECHNOLOGIES THROUGH REQUIREMENTS ON MANUFACTURERS REALLY PRODUCERS OF THE- SO POLICIES REALLY FOCUS ON THIS SIDE OF THE- THEN. YOU SORT OF HAVE HALL AT A OF ON YOU THAT. SUPPLY YOU'LL NEED. IN THE INTEREST TO CHARGER TO REFUEL THAT VEHICLES IT'S SORT OF LIKE IF APPLE WERE THE VEHICLE. THE I. CHARGE CELLULAR IN TOWERS WOULD BE SORT OF INTEREST MAKE EVERYTHING. FINE EVEN IF YOU'RE THE FOR SHE TO THERE ARE REMAIN BARRIER OF COURSE TO THE END. OF THE CONSUMER LEVEL WHEN FLEET LEVEL ZERO VEHICLES. MANAGER HAVE YOU BOTH MOM. AND NON INCENTIVE PROGRAM SIMILAR THOSE THAT BEEN AND DONE INTO AND ARE BEING DISCUSSED TODAY. I JUST TAKE A STEP BACK ON WHY EIGHT. SUBJECT LEADER IN ALL OF THESE TYPES OF PRO. NOT ONLY A- THE WILL FIFTH LARGEST AND HOT WHICH GERMAN AND INDIA. BECAUSE HEALTH STATE. ARE REALLY AND PROGRAM ARE REALLY DONE OR CONSIDERED BY MY OF THE S. MORE- YOUR- HERE CALVET CLEAN STANDARDS WELL AS CHANGED STANDARDS HAVE BEEN A JOB. OR BEING CAN. I STATES ARE THE COUNTRY RIGHT. OVER FORTY PER OF THE MAR. SO STATE ACROSS THE AS WELL AS JURY. AND YOU'RE NOT INCLUDING AND EUROPE ARE LOOKING AT YOUR CHILD'S. FOR THE POLICY LEADERSHIP SOLUTIONS REALLY TACKLE AIR POLLUTION AND CLIMATE CHANGE AND REALLY HOW TO MAKE SMARTER INVESTMENTS. IN CENTERPOINT. SEVERAL WHY ARE WE EVEN TALKING ABOUT IN. AND TODAY I'M HERE A GREAT. YES ONE OF MAJOR- TODAY IS AN INCOME COSTS PRETTY BASED BY CAN. WERE LOW TO AND EMISSION VEHICLES. SUCH AS A LIFE CARS CHAU HERE- BUT GOOD NEWS IS THAT THIS. THAT SHALL. ARE AROUND COST KNOWLEDGE. BOTH ON THE PASSENGER MARKET AS WELL AS FOR MEDIUM HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS. THE CULTURE COME DOWN RIGHT. AND THIS EXAMPLE HERE SHE THAT I THINK SHOULD RED DOT IN COST OF BATTERY. AND A CON US. IN SEPARATE ACTION STARTING TO GIVE ME. THE INITIAL PRICE PREMIUM IS FALLING PURSES AND GAS. INTERNAL ENGINE VEHICLE BASED YOU SEEN NOW- DOWN O ZERO. OUT WITHIN THE TWENTY TWO FIVE TO TWENTY THIRTY TIMES RIGHT. TAKE HERE IS THAT YOU DON'T NEED VEHICLE ONE'S. I'M NOT TO CONTINUE FOR AT. BUT REALLY YOU JUNE THEM EARLY. YOU ADDRESS THE CAN VALUES RIGHT YOU THE POINT IN THE ORDER. FOR CAL YOU NEED I AMBITIONS CHARGE A BEST THIRTY YEAR OLD WHETHER BE GOVERNOR'S. ORDER AFTER THAT HAPPENS. I'LL WILL BECOME BECAUSE CONTROL ON THE OWN. SO WHAT I'M SURE CONSULTING DID REALLY IS TO FOR THIS HEARING IS A LOOK AT IF YOU OF THOSE. UP FRONT. ON INDIA BASED. ACROSS ENTIRE FLEET. THAT YOU TO GET THAT EIGHT MILLION STAFF BY. TWENTY NOT JUST PASSENGER VEHICLE CARS AND BUT ALSO THE BIG BIG RIGS YOU KNOW THE MEDIUM AND HAVE DUTY AS WELL. AND THROW IN THE INTEREST BASS. IN TO ENABLE SUCCESS. AT A REALLY HIGH LEVEL THE FRONT. OF THAT TOTAL. BROUGH TWENTY THIRD WELL TO BE ABOUT FORTY SIX. ANNUALLY THAT WOULD BE NEEDED IN OF. SIDE IN I DIDN'T ASK RATHER CONSIDER WITH WEEDS AS WELL AS- IN- LOOK LIKE PRETTY LARGE NUMBERS BUT YOU'RE JUST QUIT THE IN YOUR- WE SPEND ROUGHLY A HIGH. INSTEAD FIVE BILLION AND- IN CAL TO PURCHASE NEW. VEHICLEAND USED VEHICLES. REGISTER AND CAR CARD SURE. TO ALLOW THOSE. ANNUAL NUMBERS AREN'T INSIGNIA. REALLY THESE TRANSITION COSTS REALLY MORE. IN COMPARE AND TO WHAT WE'RE CHANGE. SO HE'S KIND OF THE COST OF TRANSITION. NOW I SHOWING. THE OTHER SIDE THE- OUR SYSTEM IT WHAT ARE THE BEST. IN TERMS OF THOSE. COSTS RIGHT WHAT ARE THE- FROM WHICH- HIS GOAL. AND COMPARING JUST HOW THEY STACK UP. AND HERE I ADDED THE BETTER. ON THE NAY SIDE IN CHINA TERMS OF. FOR SO WHILE AND IT. EARLY OR IS THE NEXT COST FOR THE STREET. OVER TIME. AS YOU. START YOUR EAGLES. LARGELY BY FOR SAY BUT- AS WELL AS NEW. HEALTH BENEFITS. AVOIDED MORE. AWARDED MORE IT FROM. SOCIAL CONSTANT- THOSE BENEFITS THAT THAT DOES START TO BREAK X. THE COST OF THE TRAIN. ITSELF AND I'LL JUST FLY IN THIS TO AND WE ONLY HAVE TIME TO AT. FROM ACTUALLY ARE UP PARTICULAR MATTER AND NOT. WHICH IS SMART. IN AS- WHAT WAS. EIGHT ALL THE WAY THROUGH TWENTY FIFTEEN ONE OF THOSE COST LOOKS LIKE ONE OF THOSE. YOU'LL SAVINGS AND THIS IS JUST A WATERFALL CHART THAT SHOWS ARE MOVING FROM THE LEFT TO THE RIGHT THE- TRANSITION COSTS IN TERMS OF THE VEHICLE ADDITIONAL VEHICLE CONSTITUTIONAL MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY THE ACOSTA INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS. BUT THEN WHEN SEE IS FOR SAVINGS JUST THOSE. IN TERMS OF SAVING RIGHT. AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE HEALTH OF NOT VERY NARROWLY JUST HEALTH. IT DOESN'T ALL OF LEARNS. AS WELL AS CLASS OF CARBON NO TWO BY THEMSELVES HELP. INVEST THERE IS FROM THE SURE AND- THAT WE OVER EIGHT BILLION IN SAVING ACCOUNTS. NEARLY AS TWO BENEFIT CONCERT. AND SO WE CAN ALL OF THIS. WE NEED TO START BACK A LITTLE INTO OF. I DOES TRANSITION CALL. EVERYONE I'VE DONE HERE IS STAFF UP- THE TRANSITION SHE EARLY. FORTY SIX THE YEAR AND COMPARED. TO THE DIRECT IN CENTER- ARE TAKEN FROM ROSS IS CABLE BUT IT'S- THANK LIKE CALCIUM CASSON AND FOCUSING MORE ON THE- INCENTIVES. ARE ALL SEASON AND SETTLE- BANK INTEREST AND YOU KNOW. WHAT INCENTIVES REPRESENT ABOUT THEIR PER OF THE OF THE- FOR THE VIEW INCENTIVE. SHOWN THE SEVEN JENNIFER DOWN BOTTOM OF STRESS INCENTIVE JOHN. HI NICHOLS. IN ORDER TO CAPTURE THIS ENORMOUS BENEFITS I SHOWED. ME THE PRO SUPPORTED BY GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS OR- AND- PRESSURE. ARE TERMS OF PROBATION AND THEY'RE NOT GOING TO AS SO I JUST SORT SUGAR. AND POTENTIAL GEEK OUR IN TWO TWENTY THREE ASSUMING PRO. DON'T GET X. SO AS AB EIGHT RICH ARM OR THE SMOG YOU KNOW. OUT OF THIS MONTH. AT AND SHOW THAT DECLINE OVER TRY. AS AND SEND PROGRAMS GET YOUR OUT- SUBJECT. IS SET TO AND- ANOTHER TWO HUNDRED FIFTY NO FOR YEAR DESPITE THESE WERE CRITICAL. AIR POLLUTION AND CLIMATE- IN TERMS OF THE INTEREST QUESTION I CAN ASK EARLIER INTEREST ME NOT AS YOU GO FORWARD. THE VEHICLE AND IN A LAST LESS THAT TOTAL TRANSIT COSTS. INFRASTRUCTURE CAN. THAT ALLOW TO BROWN UP AND THAT'S IT'S IMPORTANT TO. THINK OF. HOW THESE TRAINS HAPPEN IN WHAT FRAME. OUT WHILE WE WERE TO COME AND SALES WHERE. NEAR DEATH HOUSE MONTH THE FIFTY AND UP WITH THE DEMAND FOR TRY A- IN TERMS OF ENGINE. TO FOR STABBING THIS. MICHAEL AND CHECK ARE WELL AHEAD OF ON THIS. AND CAL WHAT LACKING THERE AS YOU TRAIN. PRO. SAMPLES ARE NOT THE LONG TERM BENEFITS STOLEN DOING SUCH WELL EXCEED THE COST- THERE'S KIND OF A INTERPLAY BETWEEN THE VEHICLE INFRASTRUCTURE COST INCENTIVES- ACTUALLY DECLINING OVER TIME WHILE CONTINUED CAPITAL INVESTMENT IN INFRASTRUCTURE REMAINS- THE ROLE OF ALL THREE POLICIES IS QUITE CLEAR IN A LOT OF THE WORK NOT JUST IN CALIFORNIA BUT ACROSS JURISDICTIONS. I THINK WE HAVE TO ULTIMATELY BRING THIS BACK DOWN HERE. HOW EQUITY JOBS AND EACH THESE ARE THE BENEFITS RIGHT FROM THIS TRANSITION OR NOT JUST DURING THIS TRANSITION ON BUT ACTUALLY THERE IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY HERE TO IMPROVE PUBLIC HEALTH. LIVER MORE EQUITABLE TRANSPORTATION OUTCOMES IN AND OUTSIDE OF JOBS LOWER TRYING TO GET RESTITUTION. THANK YOU I'M HERE AS WELL STRUCK TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. DEPUTY DIRECTOR LEE AND CHUCK DID YOU WANT TO GO HEAD AND I WE HAVE CHECK SHE LOCK AS WELL- PRESIDENT OF JULY CONSULTING I'M NOT SURE IF YOU WANTED TO ADD ANYTHING BEFORE WE GET TO QUESTIONS. OKAY YEAH I THINK HE'S- I THINK I DELIVERED DAHLE MUCH OF THE FINDINGS FROM THIS REPORT ANYTIME TO. OFFER ANY QUESTIONS OKAY GREAT THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT. ALL RIGHT- SO WE'VE CONCLUDED THE FIRST PANEL THANK YOU SO MUCH JOHN AMEND AND WE'LL GO TO MEMBERS FOR ANY QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME AND SENATOR WHAT KASKY HAS A QUESTION START WITH HIM. FIVE IF I THINK I'M- READING THE- THE REPORT CORRECT WE'RE SAYING THAT. VEHICLE SUBSIDIES PERHAPS BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE WE'RE NOT GOING TO NEED TO DO ANY SUBSIDIES BECAUSE THE THAT AMOUNT IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO THE COMPETITIVE WITH CAST TO THE QUESTION WOULD BE. WHAT THIS IS SUBSIDY LOOK FORM FISCAL TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO IN FOR THE NEXT FOUR YEARS TO TWENTY TWENTY FIVE WE'VE SORT OF USED TO TARGET OF TWO HUNDRED- MILLION I UNDERSTAND THAT. RECEIVE THE RP IS GONNA RUN OUT OF MONEY IN ABOUT THREE WEEKS- HOW DO WE- BRIDGE THAT LONG TERM GOAL VERSUS- A YEAR YEAR. UN ALLOCATION CANNOT INPUT KNOWING THAT TO GET THE LATEST VERSION HAS ZERO FUNDS IN THERE NOW. AND DINNER CORRECT GO RIGHT AHEAD AND JUMP IN AND ROSS IF YOU WANNA FOLLOW UP LIKE I THINK THAT THE- QUESTION IS WE REALLY SPOT ON AND THAT- THERE'S OBVIOUSLY A AGE GAP IN IN TERMS OF. WHAT'S AVAILABLE RIGHT NOW IN TERMS THAT ZERO AMOUNT I THINK THERE ARE WAYS TO OBVIOUSLY IMPROVE THE WAY THE VEHICLE INCENTIVE PROGRAMS PARTICULARLY IN THE LIGHT DUTY- RAMP. UP AND- GETTING EQUITY AS WELL AS LOWER INCOME HOUSEHOLDS WE COULD DO A BETTER JOB THERE BUT ULTIMATELY I THINK BECAUSE OF THE SCALE THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. THAT WERE REALLY- NOT ALLOWABLE RIGHT THAT WE PROBABLY NEED TO BE IN TERMS OUT ENCOURAGING CONSUMERS TO ADOPT THESE TECHNOLOGIES AND MAKING ACCESS AVAILABLE TO ALL CALIFORNIANS INCEPTION I THINK TWO HUNDRED MILLION AS A STARTING POINT OF COURSE- BUT REALLY THE QUESTION AROUND. CONTINUITY IS A KEY ONE RIGHT- WHETHER THESE CONSUMERS KNOW ABOUT THESE PROGRAMS AND IT TAKES YEARS TO EDUCATE CONSUMERS BUT IT EVAPORATES ONE YEAR AND THEN STARTS UP ANOTHER. DOWN. THE ROAD YOU KNOW THOSE ARE. NO WAS ALSO THE- OF THE- THOSE TYPES OF STARTS. I GUESS. DIçN OF MISTER BROWN OR DOCTOR BROWN WANTS TO SAY ANYTHING- YEAH I'LL JUST MAYBE JUST ADD TO- ONE BRIEF COMMENTS- YOU JUST WANT MORE OF THAT KIND OF CONSIDERATION WHEN THINKING ABOUT THE OVERALL MAGNITUDE OF FUNDING NEEDED TO KIND OF GET TO SOME OF THE GOALS THAT HAVE BEEN LAID OUT AND- I THINK IT'S JUST AROUND KIND OF SOME OF THE CHALLENGES AND KNOWING KIND OF WHAT LEVEL OF INCENTIVES NEEDED TO ENCOURAGE- YOU KNOW CONSUMER ADOPTION I THINK THEY'RE YOU KNOW THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENCE. CHARACTERISTICS THAT CONSUMERS VALUE AND THEIR VEHICLES A LOT OF DIFFERENT FACTORS THAT THEY TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THINK. YOU KNOW SYSTEMS A NICE JOB OF KIND OF IDENTIFYING THE- THE GAP BETWEEN KIND OF PURCHASE PRICE AND- SAYS VERSUS OTHER VEHICLES- BUT SOMETIMES I THINK IT'S IT CAN BE A LITTLE BIT MORE CHALLENGING TO KNOW KIND OF EXACTLY WHAT LEVEL DOES THE INCIDENT NEED TO BE EXACTLY NOT AMOUNTS DOESN'T NEED TO BE A LITTLE BIT LESS DOESN'T NEED TO BE MORE IN ORDER TO KIND OF ACTUALLY. CHANGE CONSUMER BEHAVIOR SO I THINK THAT'S KIND OF ONE OF THE OPEN QUESTIONS THAT MAKES ME OF THIS- YOU KNOW THE QUESTION THAT YOU ASKED- SOMEWHAT DIFFICULT TO. ANSWER AND SO MAYBE AN AREA FOR KIND OF SIZE AND FUTURE EXPLORATION AND RESEARCH FOR EXAMPLE IT SORT OF BEGS THE QUESTION WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE I GUESS THE- HEAD OUT THAT WE HAVE IS IF YOU THINKING THAT. THE INCENTIVE PROGRAM TO CHANGE PEOPLE'S BEHAVIOURS BASICALLY TO TWENTY TWENTY FIVE YOU GOT FOUR YEARS- AND THEN THERE'S A SWEET SIXTY EIGHT MONTHS TO GET A REBATE THERE'S CLEARLY SOME REFORM THAT YOU WOULD PUT MONEY ON THE HOOD AND SAY IT'S NOT A REBATE YOU GET THE MONEY. OFF YOUR TAXES ARE OFF YOUR DMV SOMETHING SIMPLE THE PEOPLE HAVE BUT ALSO FRONT LOADED FOR FOUR YEARS AND SAYING THIS IS IT IT'S A BILLION BUCKS AND FIRST COME FIRST SERVE YOU YOU GET YOUR MONEY I DO HAVE A QUESTION ON INFRASTRUCTURE BECAUSE WE GO. THE PRESIDENT'S INFRASTRUCTURE BILL TALKS ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION IN PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE BUT NOT NOT APARTMENT BUILDINGS NOT MY BACKYARD- IN IF I DO THE MATH RIGHT NOW 12% OF THAT WOULD BE SIXTY TWO MILLION BUCKS FOR CALIFORNIA SORT OF. A NICE NUMBER- THE GOV SCOTT OF. DOLLAR THERE. BUT DEPUTY SIGN HERE TALKING. FOUR TO SIX BILLION OVER A NINE YEAR PERIOD AND SO LET'S SAY WE'RE A TWO WE GET TO SIXTY TWO WERE HORT OF THE FOUR BILLION OR MAYBE WE MAKE THE TWENTY TWENTY TWO GOALS BUT THE REST OF THE TRAJECTORY DOESN'T SHOW AT LEAST THE INVESTMENT. IS MY MATH RIGHT IS THIS IS THIS IS THIS GOING TO OUR ARE WE MEETING OUR INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS FOR THE YEAR TWENTY TWENTY TWO IF WE GET IT WE SENT A BILLION BUCKS WE TAKE THE MONEY FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. IT'S A IT'S A GREAT QUESTION- YOU KNOW IT'S REALLY GREAT NEWS THAT THE BINDING RESTORATION HAS PROPOSED INVESTMENTS IN THE CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE. THINGS LIKE DOMESTIC MANUFACTURING BILL CERTAINLY COMPLEMENT RIGHT IF IT PASSES THROUGH CONGRESS YOU KNOW COMPLIMENTS CALIFORNIA EFFORT. TO HELP REACH THIS LARGE TRANSITION GAP ON I'M SHOWING WE'RE SHOWING IN TERMS OF INFRASTRUCTURE. COSTS IT WON'T FILL THE ENTIRE NEED DENTAL- I THINK THAT'S WHERE THINGS LIKE EASY CHILE PROGRAMS RIGHT COME INTO PLAY- PRIVATE INVESTMENTS COME INTO PLAY SO THAT'S TRANSITION COSTS I THINK THE QUESTION IS. NOT HOW MUCH OF TRANSITION COSTS ARE. BUT REALLY. HOW MUCH SHOULD THE PRIVATE. THE SURPRISE AND YOU TAKE OUT ON HOW MUCH CONSUME TAKE THAT ON. FIRST IS OUT PUBLIC DOLLARS IN TERMS OF PUBLIC. CHANGE AND- HOW LONG DO WE NEED TO AS FAR AS IN IT'S TRUE WHAT WE'RE SHOWING IS. YOU KNOW OVER THE FIVE NEXT FIVE SIX YEARS IS A BIG NEED BUT AND WE KIND OF HAD A MAGICAL SPOT LIKE WE'VE DONE WITH RENEWABLES AND- WHERE THE INCENTIVES MAY. JUST BASICALLY ARE. I THOUGHT HE LAST NEEDED OVERTIME. OKAY THANK YOU SENATOR MCCASKEY WILL MOVE ON TO SENATOR DOLLY. GOOD MORNING OR GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR CAN YOU HEAR ME. YES WE CAN'T. MY QUESTION IS A ON THE INFRASTRUCTURE SIDE OF IT ACTUALLY I JUST LOOKED LAST NIGHT TO. MAYBE PURCHASE A- IS THAT VEHICLE- BUT IF THE STRUCTURE FOR CHARGING WHAT WOULD YOU WHAT WOULD IT SEEMS LIKE TO ME THAT THAT'S ONE OF THE BARRIERS THAT ARE HOLDING BACK PEOPLE FROM PURCHASING I LIKE MYSELF BECAUSE THE INFRASTRUCTURE JUST REALLY NOT AVAILABLE AND I WOULD HAVE TO PUT IN A YOU KNOW PUT A PERSONAL PRIDE. STATION CHARGING STATION AMOUNT OF RESIDENTS. CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE GOING FORWARD AND WHAT WHAT WHAT THE NEED IS TO GET TO WHERE WE WANT FOR THE OBJECTIVES TO. MEET THAT- LOFTY GOALS WE HAVE. SO I CAN TAKE A AN INITIAL STAB AT IT AND- I THINK ACTUALLY THE ADMINISTRATION WILL PROBABLY BE ABLE TO SPEAK TO THIS ISSUE A LOT MORE THE ENERGY COMMISSION HAS DONE QUITE A BIT OF ANALYSIS AROUND- INFRASTRUCTURE AND KIND OF WHAT'S NEEDED TO MEET THE STATE GOALS I THINK JUST. A COUPLE OF NUMBERS MAYBE AND THE ADMINISTRATION'S GOAL IS TO MEET ITS TWENTY TWENTY FIVE ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE- TARGETS TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND- CHARGERS THAT'S ON A LEVEL TWO CHARGERS AS WELL AS- DC FAST CHARGER SO THAT DOESN'T INCLUDE THE KIND OF HOME CHARGERS ARE ONES THAT ARE IN KIND OF A SINGLE FAMILY HOMES IT'S KIND OF MORE PUBLIC OR SHARED PRIVATE. CHARGERS RIGHT NOW I THINK WE'RE AT- CLOSE TO SIXTY OR SEVENTY THOUSAND DON'T QUOTE ME ON THAT EXACTLY BUT THERE'S A LOT OF FUN UNITS IN THE PIPELINE TO KIND OF BUILD OUT THAT CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS AND SO- THERE'S A AS A GAP OF ABOUT SIXTY THOUSAND CHARGERS AND I THINK THAT ARE NEEDED TO KIND OF NEED THAT TWENTY TWENTY FIVE GOAL AND THAT'S KIND OF THE- ONE OF THE MAIN FOCUSES OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S INFRASTRUCTURE PROPOSAL THAT'S IN THE BUDGET THIS YEAR AND THE BILLION DOLLARS- AT LEAST A FEW HUNDRED MILLION OF THAT WILL BE TIME TO. TO MEET THAT IDENTIFY .COM TO TWENTY TWENTY FIVE SO THAT'S ONE PIECE I THINK WHEN YOU LOOK FURTHER OUT OUT TO TWENTY THIRTY AND SOME O THE MORE AN AMBITIOUS GOALS KIND OF LONGER TERM GOALS- I KNOW SOME OF THE ENERGY COMMISSION ANALYSES SIDES I SAID THAT TO KIND OF BE ON TRACK TO MEET THE- GOVERNOR'S MOST RECENT EXECUTIVE ORDER GOALS- THE STATE'S GONNA NEEDS- CLOSE TO ONE AND A HALF MILLION CHARGERS SO THAT'S YOU KNOW AN INCREASE FROM TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND AND TWENTY TWENTY FIVE TO. ONE AND A HALF MILLION AND TWENTY THIRTY SO THAT'S A LARGE RAMP UP AND I THINK YOU'RE PRESS GETS TO SOME OF THE NUMBERS THAT- SIMON TALKED ABOUT BEFORE AND IN TERMS. OF KIND OF INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDED AND I DO JUST WANT TO KIND OF HIGHLIGHT ANY OTHER POINT THAT YOU MAY AS WELL AS- ONE OF THE BIG QUESTIONS THINK IS. AND WHAT THE STATE'S ROLE WILL NEED TO BE AND- SUPPORTING NOT INFRASTRUCTURE BUILD OUT HOW. WILL BE COVERED BY. PRIVATE ENTITIES- VERSUS KIND OF WHERE WE'RE OR RULES FOR EACH OF THE STATE WILL BE. OKAY THAT'S HELPFUL. IF YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR DOLLY I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THERE ARE NO OTHER QUESTIONS FOR MEMBERS- I'M SORRY SENATE SENATOR ARCHER LETTER RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME I APOLOGIZE GO RIGHT AHEAD. THANK YOU VENTURE- I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT TO THE- THE CO CHAIR OF FOR THE BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE- YOU RIGHT ON SENATOR WITH SOME OF YOUR COMMENTS IN YOUR OPENING REMARKS. THAT OPENED UP A LOT OF QUESTIONS THAT- OBVIOUSLY KEEP COMING UP AS AN EXAMPLE I BRING- TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR GOVERNOR SCHWARZENEGGER AT THE TIME ISSUED EXECUTIVE ORDER- WELL FOR THE LAST. TWO DIGITS- FOR TO DEVELOP A NETWORK OF HYDROGEN FUELING STATIONS AND IN CONVERSATION- TODAY WE'VE NOT HEARD ABOUT HYDROGEN AND HOW THAT IS- IT NECESSARY TO PLAY IN THE GOLD OF THE FUTURE. TWENTY TWENTY FIVE TWENTY THIRTY FIVE BELIEVE IT OR NOT IS AROUND THE CORNER WITH WITH- WITH THE FACT THAT WE'VE GOT. SO MUCH ON OUR PLATE. AND I UNDERSTAND THAT IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN I THINK- OUR GOAL WAS- TWO HUNDRED HYDROGEN FUELING STATIONS- AND TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND ELECTRIC FEUDING. CHARGING STATIONS SO IF WE'RE LOOKING TO COMBINE HYDROGEN AND WITH IT AND I AM HOPING THAT WE ARE WE'VE GT TO THINK ABOUT THE INFRASTRUCTURE. BUT AS YOU TALK ABOUT THE ELECTRIC FUELING STATIONS- YOU HAVEN'T MENTIONED ABOUT A PARTNERSHIP WITH THE EDISON COMPANY IN A PARTNERSHIP WITH SOME ELECTRIC COMPANIES. IS THAT SOLELY GOING TO BE OUR RESPONSIBILITIES STATE TO ESTABLISH THESE VARIOUS FUELING STATIONS AT LOCAL PARKS MARKETS WHEREVER THEY MIGHT BE. AND ALSO IT IS IT IT'S A IT'S A NECESSARY I THINK FOR ALL OF US RIGHT NOW TO UNDERSTAND. THAT IF WE DON'T ADD HYDROGEN TO OUR GOALS WE'RE GOING TO FALL SHORT. AND I KNOW THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT- SMALL VEHICLES PURSES LARGER TRUCKS AND SO ON AND I THINK WE ALL KNOW THAT THESE LARGE TRUCKS COMING OUT OF- THE CHAIRMAN'S LOCATION AND OUT OF THE PORT OF LONG BEACH. CANNOT HANDLE A BATTERY RUN HUGE HUGE EIGHTEEN WHEELER. BUT MAYBE IN THE FUTURE. A EIGHTEEN WHEELER CAN BE RUN ON HYDROGEN. AND TOWARD LIKE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT AND SHE HOW WEAK YOU FEEL THAT HYDROGEN MIGHT BE PART OF THIS ENTIRE- SUBJECT HERE. THANK YOU SENATOR ARCHULETA IN WHO FROM OUR PANEL WOULD LIKE TO TAKE THAT QUESTION. I CAN GET THIS I THINK. THAT QUESTION ON. YES IT SHOULD THE PRESENTATION DIDN'T FOCUS ON ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES WHICH INCLUDES PLUG IN ELECTRICS AND SHE'LL SELL VEHICLES WE DO SEE A ROLE TO PLAY ON THE MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY TRUCK SIDE FOUR HUNDRED IN FUEL CELL TRUCK DEPLOYMENT ACTUALLY THE INFRASTRUCTURE COST NUMBERS I SHOWED. INCLUDED BOTH THE HYDROGEN AS WELL AS- CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE. YOU KNOW I'M THE YOU KNOW HORSE IN THE RIGHT NOW- THERE ARE WARM MODELS ALECTRA PEOPLE'S BEING DEPLOYED- FIFTY TO SIXTY RIGHT NOW- NOT AS MANY AT FROM THE HYDROGEN SIDE BUT I DO THINK. IT IS WORTH. TAKING A CLOSER LOOK AT WHETHER OR IN THE- LATER YEARS TWENTY THIRTY TWENTY FORTY WHETHER THE TWO HUNDRED MILLION I'M TWO HUNDRED STATIONS TARGETED HOW HOW THAT. IT WILL THAT BE SUFFICIENT WILL- THEY BE WELL UTILIZED HOW DO YOU PUT TOGETHER THE VEHICLE AND FEELS TOGETHER IN TERMS OF THE INVESTMENTS ON TO MAKE SURE THAT EIGHT. FORTY NINE EXCEPT AS A PRIOR- CENTER SAD. YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE LOOKING TO BUY A VEHICLE YOU REALLY NEED TO. HAVE INSURANCE SAYS THAT YOU KNOW THERE'S INFRASTRUCTURE NOT JUST AT THE HOME OF PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE AND REALLY THAT THE CHALLENGE HERE IS THAT THOSE INTEREST AFTER HAAS RIGHT. ET AL MAN YOU DIDN'T DIE IN THE STRIP OF HIGHWAY RIGHT IT WAS A COLLECTIVE DECISION TO. TO CREATE A NETWORK RIGHT WHETHER IT BE THAT THE TELEPHONE POLES OF OLDER. AND THE CELL NETWORKS AND HIGHWAYS- ALL OF THAT NEEDS TO BE SORT OF THAT PUBLIC INVESTMENT A GOOD COMPONENT. IT NEEDS TO BE A PUBLIC BUS. I'D LIKE TO FOUR AND OUT THAT BEARD MICHAEL IS TO PAY. OF ELECTRIC VERSUS. BY TO MAKE IT A- IN OUR GOAL- FOR OUR ECONOMY AND NOT ONLY ARE ARE- ENVIRONMENT AND SO ON BUT I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT NINE BY TWO TO DO THIS PRESENT MADAM CHAIR I'D LIKE TO. INVITE YOU DO THIS WITH IS WELL CAL STATE LA. RIGHT OUTSIDE MY DISTRICT. THE ENTIRE FLEET OF CAL STATE ARE LAKE VIDEO BECAUSE OUR RUN ON HYDROGEN THEY HAVE A HYDROGEN FUELING STATION. LOOKS LIKE A MINI GAS STATION. AND THEY RUN ALL THEIR POLICE VEHICLES SCHOOL VEHICLES AND I BELIEVE THEY HAVE SOMEWHERE ABOUT TO TWENTY EIGHT TO THIRTY VEHICLES. AND PRETTY EFFICIENT AND IT'S OPEN TO THE PUBLIC AS WELL SO I THINK WE NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT- BECAUSE I THINK I HEARD SOMEONE MENTION THEY HAD TO. INSTALL THE- THE ELECTRIC- HOOK UP AT THEIR HOME- WELL IF THE HYDROGEN IT IS THERE IN A PUBLIC LOCATION AT GAS STATIONS AS THERE IS ONE HERE IN SACRAMENTO. THEN WE HAVE A LEG UP. ON INFRASTRUCTURE BUT WE NEEDED TO PUT THAT ON THE LINE AND- AND MAKE IT PART OF OUR FUTURE THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR ARCHULETA AND I HAVE A QUESTION AND I THINK ALL DIRECT THIS TO DEPUTY DIRECTOR ME AS WELL- YOU'D MENTIONED AND THE- BAD TO SAY THAT YOU HAD SUGGESTED THAT WE- SEE THAT CALIFORNIA WAS LAST FOR CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE AS WE'VE- MENTIONED THAT. AND NUMEROUS TIMES. AND SPECIFICALLY YOU CALL THAT THE MULTI DWELLING UNIT- UP PROGRAMS WOULD BE A GOOD START SO. SINCE WE'RE SO BEHIND AND I KNOW THAT THERE HAS BEEN SOME- PIECES OF LEGISLATION THAT OF REDUCE BARRIERS TO ENTRY FOR MULTI DWELLING UNIT. OF PROPERTIES BUT WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS AROUND- THAT AND HOW WE CAN ACCELERATE THAT AND ESPECIALLY YOU KNOW. THE WAY I LOOK AT IT IS IN SPACES LIKE LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES IT TRULY REALLY NEED THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE INVESTMENTS THERE. YEAH YEAH IT'S AN IMPORTANT QUESTION IN THE DEPLOYMENT TO ENSURE ACCESS RIGHT IN TERMS OF HOW WE DEPLOY INFRASTRUCTURE ENERGY C. IS PART OF THE- A GROUP OF COALITION OF GROUPS INCLUDING- GREEN LINING AND COALITION FOR CLEAN AIR- ADVOCATING RIGHT NOW OR- INVESTMENTS YOU JOINED ASPIN INSPITE- TO COMMISSION AND AS WELL AS AT THE PUCT. TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS EQUITY TARGETS THAT ARE ARE FAILED IN TERMS OF DEPLOYMENT A LOT OF THOSE INVESTMENTS TODAY- ARE ARE BEING STARTING TO BE TARGETED IS JUST A START THOUGH AND WE REALLY WANT TO SEE THOSE MULTI UNIT DWELLINGS ARE CRITICAL IN PLACES WHERE YOU REALLY. YOU KNOW THE TENANT DOESN'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO TELL A LANDLORD NOW SHALL PUT IN INFRASTRUCTURE HERE BECAUSE OTHERWISE I CAN'T GET A VEHICLE SO THERE NEEDS TO BE SIGNED. UP I REALLY HI SO ON ON MULTI UNIT DWELLING. HOW DO I REALLY GET LANDLORDS HOW TO INCENTIVIZE THEM HOW DO YOU CREATE- BUILDING CODES AND REQUIREMENTS SUCH THAT. WE MAKE SURE THAT LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES I AND MODERATE INCOME COMMUNITIES ARE REALLY FIRST IN LINE RATHER THAN GETTING LIKE A TECHNOLOGY ACCESS LATER DOWN THE- AND JUST AS A FOLLOW UP TO THAT THE SINCE WE ARE LAST IN TERMS OF BUT COMPARED TO OTHER STATES ARE THERE. OTHER STATES THAT ARE DOING THIS I OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE DOING THIS MUCH BETTER THAN WE ARE BUT ANY- EXAMPLES IN OTHER STATES THAT WE CAN. SORT OF LEAN ON. IT IN IN THIS MULTI DWELLING UNITS BASED. YEAH I AND I DON'T WANT TO DISCOUNT CALIFORNIA'S LEADERSHIP WHERE WE'RE LACKING IS THAT THE INFRASTRUCTURE RIGHT HASN'T CAUGHT UP TO OUR EASY DEPLOYMENT WE JUST HAVE SO MANY MUCH NEEDED APPOINTED COMPARED TO OTHER STATES AND CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE IS LACKING FROM THAT YOU KNOW IF YOU JUST LOOK AT THE RATIO BETWEEN THE TWO- I THINK SURPRISINGLY THERE'S A LOT OF GOOD STUFF HAPPENING- I NEW YORK JETS DOT COM. ANNOUNCER WILL BE INVESTING IN INFRASTRUCTURE- WITH FOCUSING ON ON MULTI UNIT DWELLINGS- WE'VE WORKED IN OHIO. WHERE- THE CITY OF COLUMBUS OHIO. AND REALLY TRYING TO TACKLE THIS ON YOU KNOW I'LL I'LL PUT A PLUG IN FOR SAN DIEGO GAS ELECTRIC THEIR WORK- WE- GET AT THIS TENANT LANDLORD ISSUE- HAS BEEN A- GREAT MODEL IN TERMS THAT APPROPRIATE STEP CROUCH- THIS MULTI UNIT DWELLING. BUT I THINK THE GOAL HERE IS TO REALLY ENSURING THE STATE'S QASSIM TARGET. MAKE SURE THAT THE- TARGETS INCLUDING THE MULTI UNIT DWELLINGS AND THAT WE ARE. YOU KNOW AT THE VERY LEAST EQUALIZING THE PLAYING FIELD TO GET INTO YOUR MACHINE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND YES THE SAN DIEGO HAS PLUG IN SAN DIEGO IN PARTNERSHIP WITH SANDAG GREAT PROGRAM THANK YOU. ALRIGHT I SEE NO OTHER QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS- SO ITH THAT WE'RE GOING TO HEAR AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO OUR FIRST PANELISTS FOR ALL OF YOUR THOUGHTS- NEXT WE WILL MOVE ON TO OUR SECOND PANEL WE'RE FORTUNATE TO HAVE A VERY STRONG PANEL POLICYMAKERS AND DECISION MAKERS FROM THE ADMINISTRATION. I THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE WILL START FIRST WITH TYSON ACKERLEY A DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE MARKET DEVELOPMENT AT THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT WILL START WITH YOU. AND WILL SAVE AGAIN ARE QUESTIONS FOR AFTER THE PANEL MEMBERS THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT CAN YOU HEAR ME. YES WE CAN OKAY THANK YOU SORRY. I'VE HAD SOME SOME SCREEN DIFFICULTIES ALL RIGHT THANK YOU THAT'S IT IT'S BEEN MY NAME IS TYSON ACT REALLY THANK YOU- CHAIR AND CO CHAIR FOR SETTING THIS UP WE'RE VERY EXCITED TO BE HERE TODAY I'M TYSON ACTUALLY I THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR EXAM MARKET DEVELOPMENT AT THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND- MY JOB IS REALLY TO PULL ALL THE PIECES TOGETHER- FOUR THREE THROUGHOUT THE MARKET I THINK THIS IS BEEN A REALLY GOOD- DISCUSSION ALREADY I THINK THE ONE THING I WANT TO REALLY STRESS. IS THAT THAT MARKET DEVELOPMENT IN ITS ABSENCE IS REALLY A TEAM SPORT IT TAKES CONTRIBUTIONS FROM ALL OF THIS TO MAKE THIS ALL OF US TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN ITS STATE AGENCIES IS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IT'S PRIVATE INDUSTRIES NGOS ITS MUNICIPALITIES- IN PO'S I MEAN THERE'S A LOT OF ACRONYMS WE COULD THROW AT. YEAH I'M AND SO WILL THIS GONNA GIVE OAKLEY LANHAM ECOSYSTEM THERE AND THEN BEFORE JUMPING INTO IT IT DID WANT TO WEIGH IN ON THE- HYDROGEN AND ELECTRIC AND PLUG IN CHARGING- IN BATTERY ELECTRIC CARS I THINK WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS PLAY TO THE STRENGTHS OF BOTH TECHNOLOGIES SO YOU KNOW RIGHT NOW WE HAVE FORTY FIVE LIGHT DUTY HYDROGEN STATIONS. WITH SOME HEAVY DUTY HYDROGEN STATIONS UNDERDEVELOPMENT SOME REALLY EXCITING STUFF COMING OUT NOW- AND THEN ON THE CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE WE STILL WE DO LEAVE THAT NATION AND CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE THIS WE'VE HAD TO BE A 50% OF THE MARKET- AND CARS AND I THINK PRETTY CLOSE 50% OF THE MARKET ON CHARGER SO. BUT OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO I THINK YOU KNOW WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT ALL THE PEOPLE WE HAVE. COORDINATED A KEY PART OF THE STRATEGY IS REALLY MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE A CLEAR NORTH STAR AND I THINK YOU KNOW WE'RE ALL HERE WE'RE VERY FAMILIAR WITH GOVERNOR NEW SENDS THAT SEPTEMBER EXECUTIVE ORDER AT BY FEELS TO ME LIKE THIS WAS TWO YEARS AGO BUT IT'S THOSE JUST IN SEPTEMBER BUT YOU KNOW THE TWENTY THIRTY FIVE TWENTY FORTY FIVE FOR HEAVY DUTY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE FOR DRAYAGE IN TWENTY THIRTY FIVE FOR OFF ROAD SO THOSE ARE ALL JUST AROUND THE CORNER. WE NEED TO EVERYBODY RUNNING AT FULL STEAM TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN. AND SO AS PART OF THAT- EXECUTIVE ORDER THE GOVERNOR TASS GOBIZ. WITH DEVELOPING IS THAT MARKET ADMINSTRATION A THREE. AND REALLY THIS IS COVER THE- AND IT I DO. WOULD LOVE YOU FOR YOUR READ AT AND IT'S YOU OPEN AND- IT IS OVERHEAD. PAGES BUT I WON. IT'S TO PAGES. THE MEAT AND THERE'S A LOT OF APPENDICES TO KIND OF PULL ALL THESE PIECES TOGETHER BUT REALLY AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL. WE'RE TRYING TO DO FIVE THINGS WITH THAT IT'S- ARTICULATING THE CORE PRINCIPLES FOR COLLECTIVE ACTION LIKE WHAT ARE WE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH. CLEARLY IDENTIFYING THE METRICS AND TARGETS SO. HOW DO WE WILL. AGREED UPON METRICS THAT WE CAN MEASURE SUCCESS AND FAILURES AGAINST SO WE HAVE WE'VE- LEARNED A LOT A LOT OF NUMBERS AROUND WE GET TO A CLEAR THING WE CAN. HAVE A SNAPSHOT. IN TIME AND EVERYBODY KNOWS THE HEALTH OF THE MARKET. ITS ESTABLISHING THEIR ROLES AND OBJECTIVES OF AGENCIES A MAJOR STAKEHOLDER GROUPS OF WHO'S DOING WHAT AND WHY. AS ORGANIZE OURSELVES AROUND COLLECTIVE PROBLEM SOLVING NO SINGLE. AGENCY NO SINGLE STAKEHOLDER HAS ALL THE ANSWERS WE HAVE TO DO THIS TOGETHER AND THEN FINALLY ENSURING THAT WE'RE LEARNING LESSONS AND CARRIED THEM FORWARD NOT JUST FOR OUR- OWN IMPLEMENTATION BUT FOR A FUTURE STATE TONIGHT. I GOT A TRUCK A LITTLE BIT THAT CENTER WHITE HOUSE MEANS THAT DON'T USE THE WORD IN POWER AND I. WAS ALREADY MY FLIGHTS BUT- IT WE DO MEAN THAT IS TRYING TO PUT IN POWER MARKET ACTORS TO EXCEED EXPECTATIONS IS. PUTTING POWER IN DECISION MAKING AS CLOSE TO THE GROUND AND IS CLOSE TO WHAT'S HAPPENING AS POSSIBLE. AND SO. ALL THE STRESS. IS AROUND THE SKY OF CORE IMAGE. AND THE IDEA THAT THERE YOU KNOW FOR. PILLARS OF THE MARKET WE HAVE THE VEHICLES INFRASTRUCTURE END USERS AND WORK FORCE AND WE NEED ALL FOUR PILLARS. TO BE AN IMBALANCE TO BE ABLE TO ADVANCE THE MARKET TOGETHER. HALF ONE FALLS BEHIND WE WE'VE LACKS IT JUST AS WE JUST TALK ABOUT IFRASTRUCTURE WE NEED INFRASTRUCTURE TO ENABLE VEHICLES. AND VICE VERSA IT'S BUILT ON A FOUNDATION OF OUR CORE PRINCIPLES THE FIRST ONE AND I'M- INTENSELY THE FIRST ONE IS. MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE EQUITY IN EVERY DECISION AND EVERY ACTION SO IT'S REALLY TAKING. A PRIORITY COMMUNITY NEEDS INTO ACCOUNT AS WE'RE MOVING FORWARD WITH OUR PLANS. IT'S THE IDEA OF EMBRACING ALL THAT PATHWAY SETS YOU KNOW BATTERY ELECTRIC AND FUEL CELL ELECTRIC IT'S HIGH SPEED RAIL IT'S EVERYTHING THAT CAN HELP. GET PEOPLE OUT OF AND COMBUSTION VEHICLES AND INTO CLEAN MODES OF TRANSPORTATION. THAT'S VOTES IN A COLLECTIVE PROBLEM SOLVING WHICH I'VE ALREADY TOUCHED ON. THE IDEA THAT PUBLIC POLICY COMPLIMENTS PRIVATE. INVESTMENT WE REALLY NEED PRIVATE CAPITAL HELP SCALE THIS MARKET IT'S ONE THING TO GET AT THE TO SEE THE MARKET WITH PUBLIC CAPITAL BUT THE PRIVATE CAPITAL HAS TO COME AND TO GET READY TO GO AND THAT. WE HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER AND THEN FINALLY THE DESIGNING FOR RESILIENCE AND OUT ADAPTATION. SO IT'S BOTH A CHALLENGE AND AN OPPORTUNITY YOU KNOW YOU LOOK AT VEHICLE GRID INTEGRATION YOU COULD USE THAT ACTUALLY INCREASE. THE ROBUSTNESS AND RESILIENCE OF THE GRID. ALL THIS IS SUPPOSED TO FEET UP INTO THESE CORE OUTCOMES YOU KNOW BETTER AIR QUALITY REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. AND CRUDE AND IMPROVE MOBILITY ACCESS- YOU LOOK AT THE PARTY COMMUNITIES IN PARTICULAR AND THEN. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND JOBS ALL HOLDING OUT INTO YOU KNOW LARGE. SCALE CAPITAL MARKET DEVELOPMENT. SO THE OVERALL. THAT WOULD TALK WITH LOOK BIT UP WITH THE STORE SO WE HAVE. AS THEIR STRATEGY WHY. WHICH KINDA HOUSES ALL THE LATEST INFORMATION THE DOCUMENTS THE PROGRESS METRICS. THAT WE'RE THAT WILL BE GOING THROUGH. AND FROM THERE WE HOUSE BOTH IT DOES THAT STRATEGY DOCUMENTS THIS IS REALLY KIND OF OUR GUIDING DOCUMENT. THAT I'M- YOU KNOW IT'S UPDATED EVERY THREE YEARS WE- SET OUT THE PRINCIPLES THE CORE OBJECTIVES IN THE DIRECTION. I'M I HAVE TH TABLE HERE IS THAT NGOS TO TABLE NINE AND THEN IN THE DOCUMENT ITSELF I PUT THEIR PURPOSE IS NOT JUST STATE AGENCIES AS WE NEED CONTRIBUTIONS FROM ALL OF THESE PARTNERS SO. WE HAVE THAT YOU KNOW HIGH LEVEL THEY HAVE CONNECTION THE EQUITY CONNECTION AND THEN THE CONNECTION INTO THE PILLARS. AND WITHIN EACH OF THESE GROUPS GROUPINGS LIKE NGOS OR FEDERAL% GOVERNMENT OR STATE AGENCIES WE'VE IDENTIFIED. I'LL LEAVE YOU KNOW ONE OR TWO LEADS AND SUPPORT FUNCTIONS WITHIN EACH OF THESE PILLARS. I'M WITHIN THAT DOCUMENT WE'VE GOT A LITTLE DEEPER ON THE AGENCIES SO WE SET OUT CLEAR OBJECTIVES SO USE GO BUSINESS AN EXAMPLE THE FIRST ONE BEING. ORGANIZING IS THAT STRATEGY AND ITS CONNECTION INTO THE PILLARS AND THEN WE'VE ALSO ADDED. THE DOCUMENTS THAT.ARE PRODUCED BY OUR AGENCIES TO HELP MOVE THE MARKET FORWARD AND INCREASED UNDERSTANDING IF YOU LOOK AT SOME AGENCIES LIKE CARPOOL HERE FROM IN A MOMENT. IF YOU HAVE A VERY LONG LIST OF DOCUMENTS BUT THEY ALL HAVE A ROLE TO PLAY IN AND ADDRESS KEY QUESTIONS WITHIN THE SUBMARKET. SO IT'S ONE THING TO HAVE. OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGY. ANY OF THE ACT BILL THAT EXIT STRATEGY IT'S HARD BUT IT. IS EASY EXECUTION AS HARD. THE STATE AGENCY ACTION PLANS ARE REALLY ABOUT EXECUTIONS WE HAVE TWENTY NINE STATE AGENCIES BET EMBEDDED IN THIS PLAN. AND EVERY YEAR THEY SAY THERE IS A MEETING. AND ANNUAL ACTION PLANS WHAT WE'VE DONE IS CHALLENGE THE AGENCIES TO TAKE THOSE OBJECTIVES AND THEN PUT OUT THE KEY RESULTS THAT WE HOPE TO ACHIEVE. WITH A FOCUS. ON COLLABORATION IN EQUITY. AT THE END OF EACH YEAR WE'RE GONNA TAKE THOSE FEW RESULTS A MEASURE AGAINST THEM WHAT DO WE GET SHE WHERE DID WE FALL SHORT WELL WHAT CAN WE LEARN AND TO APPLY THAT MOVING FORWARD. SO THESE ARE ALL POSTED OUR WEBSITE HANKER YOU TAKE A LOOK AT FUND CLICK AROUND THAT WE WE'RE A LITTLE BIT LOOSE ON THAT DESIGN IT'S YOU'LL SEE SOME BUT DIFFERENT THAN OTHERS. BUT THE DIRECTION IS REALLY TO BE CONCISE OF THAT YOU KNOW WE CAN GO IN AND QUICKLY UNDERSTAND WHAT EACH AGENCY IS UP TO AND HOW IT CONNECTS OTHER AGENCIES AND STAKEHOLDER GROUPS. AND THEN. FINALLY YOU MOVING FORWARD WE WE'RE WORKING THIS IS. UNDER DEVELOPMENT BUT IT'S WHAT RECLINER. IN A PILLAR PRIORITY ACTION PLANS. THE ONE OF THEM SENDING EQUITY ENGAGEMENT WHICH THEY DON'T HAVE SKETCHED OUT HERE. BUT IT'S REALLY PUTTING ALL THE ENGAGEMENT WE DO AS THIS AS A STATE ALL THAT. ACROSS ALL AGENCIES UNDER ONE DOCUMENTS AND ONE ROOF. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE. REACHING OUT TO THE PRIORITY COMMUNITIES AND THAT ORGANIZED. COLLECTIVE WAY. AND THAT WE'RE FEEDING THAT INFORMATION INTO ALL OF OUR PROCEEDINGS REGULATORY DEVELOPMENT INCENTIVE PROGRAMS. AND THE SECOND ONE IS KIND OF THIS IDEA OF THIS MULTI COLOR ACTION PLAN. SO VERY SIMILAR TO THE STATE ACTION PLANS THIS IS MORE OF A COLLECTIVE VIEW WHAT ARE THE- KEY THINGS WE'RE TRYING TO ADVANCE- THIS YEAR. THE TAKE THAT THAT'S KIND OF THIS COLORFUL CIRCLE HERE THE IDEA THAT YOU KNOW INFRASTRUCTURE IS AN ENABLER WHAT WE GONNA DO UNDER INFRASTRUCTURE THIS YEAR. WE NEED TO CHANGE BEHAVIORAND YOU GET PEOPLE THE YES. WHAT WE GONNA DO THERE AND MEASURE AGAINST. ONCE YOU HAVE THOSE TWO COMPONENTS SCALE IS REALLY IMPORTANT IT'S ABOUT INCREASING INVESTOR CONFIDENCE THAT'S HOW WE GET FROM WHERE WE- WHERE WE ARE TODAY TO WHERE WE NEED TO BE. AND THEN FINALLY IS THE IDEA OF BUILDING THE INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA YOU'LL HEAR FROM. YOUR WHOLE CHILL ABOUT YOU KNOW IF THIRTY FOUR AS THAT MANUFACTURERS IN CALIFORNIA. WE GET ATTRACT A LOT OF THE CAPITAL- AND SO THERE'S A BIG OPPORTUNITY TO GREAT. AT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND JOBS. AND FINALLY THERE'S A LOT TO DO AN IMPLEMENTATION WE'RE LASER FOCUSED ON THAT. IMPLEMENTATION AND EXECUTION. AND THEN BELOW THAT. WITHIN THE PILLARS THERE IT'S IN COMMON BUT SHARED UNDERSTANDING FOR EXAMPLE THAT WE'RE TRYING TO DEVELOPMENTS ITS USE MY HAND WRITING HERE ABOUT A LOT OF FUN WITH MY- MY SERVICE. AND THE FACT. IDEA HERE IS YOU KNOW WITHIN VEHICLES INFRASTRUCTURE END USERS WORKFORCE. EACH OF THOSE HAS AND THEN I LIKE THE METRIC THAT WE NEED TO DEVELOP OUT. AND FURTHER. REINFORCED TO HELP. COLLECTIVE UNDERSTANDING WHERE WE ARE IN THE MARKET. THERE'S BACKBONE POLICIES YOU'LL HEAR ABOUT FROM OUR CORE AGENCIES AND THEN THERE'S ALSO REGIONAL LEADERSHIP I REALLY WANT TO SHOWCASE- IN THAT KIND OF. REALLY CREATE A RACE TO THE TOP. SO TODAY'S PANEL. YOU KNOW IT'S A SET COMPONENT OF THE TWO NINETY. THAT SHOW EARLY. BUT YOU KNOW WE HAVE CAR. THE AND HE IS. AND IS THERE ARE MANY. AT LEE. AGE A- WAS THE LEAD ON VEHICLE AND END USERS. THEN WE HAVE THE I CC AND THE UC COLLEAGUES ON INFRASTRUCTURE BUT EVERYBODY. IS TALKING TO EACH OTHER MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE COORDINATED WITH THE PROGRAMS THAT THEY ARE COMPLEMENTARY GOING FORWARD. AND NOT IT'S NOT JUST THESE THREE AGENCIES IS THE TWENTY NINE. AS WELL AND THEN IT RELATES TO ALL THE OTHER STAKEHOLDERS- SO WITH THAT I WANT TO HAND IT. OVER TO CHAIR HOPE SHIELDS AND THEN. WE CAN YOU QUESTIONS AT THE END. THANK YOU. OKAY GO RIGHT AHEAD. THANK YOU CHAIR GONZALEZ RECOUNTS KEY MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO APPEAR BEFORE YOU TODAY MY NAME IS DAVID HOPES ALL THE TIME CHAIR THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION AND I'M JOINED TODAY BY HAND AND WRIST SCHOOL WHO IS OUR DEPUTY IN CHARGE OF THE ENERGY COMMISSION'S QUIT TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM MANAGES A TEAM OF SEVENTY PEOPLE OVERSEEING. ALL THE INFRASTRUCTURE DEPLOYMENT WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT I'M GOING TO BEGIN JUST BY SAYING THANK YOU TO ALL OF YOU IN THE LEGISLATURE FOR THE LEADERSHIP-YOU SHOWN ON THE COMMITMENT TO CLEAN TRANSPORTATION. IT IS MAKING A DIFFERENCE I REALLY THINK IT IS WORTH REMEMBERING THAT YOU KNOW THE MODERN SOLAR WIND INDUSTRY BEGAN IN CALIFORNIA SPREAD AROUND THE COUNTRY AROUND THE WORLD THE FIRST UTILITY SCALE SOLAR WIND PROJECTS WERE DEPLOYED HERE BECAUSE OF POLICY AND THEY'RE NOW THE LOWEST COST FASTEST GROWING SOURCES OF ENERGY IN THE WORLD AND WE'RE ON A PATH TO DO THAT FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLES AS WELL. AND YOUR POLICY MAKING IS INSTRUMENTAL IN THAT AND SO I WANT TO START REALLY WITH A SNAPSHOT OF WHERE WE ARE. AND I CANNOT OVERSTATE THE RULE OF CALIFORNIA IN DRIVING THIS INDUSTRY- TODAY CALIFORNIA REPRESENTS 50% OF THE U. S. MARKET FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLES. WE HAVE HAD EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS LIKE TO BE A SOLD. INYOUR MISSION AND SEVENTY THOUSAND- PUBLIC CHARGERS NOT INSTALLED TODAY AND IS TIED TO MENTION WE HAVE THIRTY FOUR COMPANIES MANUFACTURE ELECTRIC VEHICLES IN THE STATE TODAY IT WAS OUR NUMBER ONE EXPORT IN TWENTY TWENTY- AND SO YOU HAVE BUSES ELECTRIC BUSES MADE BY COMPANIES LIKE PROTERRA. AND B. Y. D. BEING SHIPPED TO FORTY STATES AROUND THE COUNTRY- AND WE'RE JUST GETTING STARTED- THE MOST VALUABLE CAR COMPANY IN THE WORLD IS A CALIFORNIA COMPANY TESLA JUST TO PUT THAT IN PERSPECTIVE. IF YOU COMBINE THE MARKET CAP OF FORD GM AND FIAT CHRYSLER TOGETHER AS LOW AS FORTY HAVE TIMES MORE VALUABLE IN ALL THOSE THREE COMBINED BUT THEY'RE CATCHING UP ABOUT FOURTEEN AND GM IN PARTICULAR INVESTING ABOUT FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. TO PROMOTE ELECTRIFICATION AND WE'RE SEEING SOME REALLY EXCITING DEVELOPMENTS IN NEW CLASS OF VEHICLES BEING INTRODUCED- ELECTRIC FORD F. ONE FIFTY IS COMING OUT NEXT YEAR THAT WILL HAVE A THREE YEAR MILE RANGE. AND THIS WEEK AS YOU MAY HAVE HEARD. THE CHEVY. ELECTRIC I GOT ANNOUNCED IT'LL BE OF HUNDRED BILLION FOR. VEHICLES ARE REAL- EXPANSION IN THE VEHICLE CLASSES WERE SEEKING- A LOT OF THIS MOMENTUM IS BEING DRIVEN IS REALLY. ROOTED IN THE REDUCTION IN THE BATTERY COSTS SO WE'VE SEEN A NINETY PERCENT. REDUCTION IN THE COST OF LITHIUM ION BATTERIES OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS. AND THERE'SA LOT MORE COST TO COME OUT OF THE BATTERY PACK REPRESENTS ABOUT HALF THE COST. OF THE VEHICLES BUT BECAUSE THE WHOLE MARKET IS WATCHING THIS TREND. ARE YOU REALLY SEEN INVESTMENT SHIFT HEAVILY EVERY MAJOR CAR COMPANY IN THE WORLD IS NOW INVESTING IN ELECTRIC VEHICLE MODELS. AND ARE BLOOMBERG NEW ENERGY FINANCE WHICH TRACKS THIS- REPORTS THERE WILL BE A HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEVEN NEW MODELS OF ELECTRIC VEHICLES. COMING TO THE NORTH AMERICA MARKET BY THE END OF NEXT YEAR SO- THIS MOMENTUM- IS UNIONS UNDER WAY AND I CANNOT THANK YOU ENOUGH FOR THE MESSAGE YOU SENT- FOR A COMMITMENT TO THIS. BINTI NATIONS NOW. MADE IT AS WELL GO 2% ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES- AND OF COURSE GOVERNOR NEWSOM. WITH THE EXECUTIVE ORDER IN SEPTEMBER- AND FOLLOWED BY- THAT'S IT THE GOVERNMENT CHOOSES TO DO THE SAME THING AND- WE EXPECT ANYMORE. SO I WOULD TURN INFRASTRUCTURE I REALLY THINK AT THIS POINT. YOU KNOW THE MESSAGES WE NEED TO GET OUR BHUTAN AND BUILDERS INFRASTRUCTURE TO MAKE IT- REALLY- TICKLED ACROSS THE STATE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. AND TO SEND THE MESSAGE THAT OTHERS LONG TERM CERTAINTY HERE FOR ALL THESE COMPANIES TO SCALE. I AM IN GROW FOR CALIFORNIA TO LEAD THAT- ONE OTHER POINT I WANT TO MAKE THAT IS A GOOD SIGN AS AS WE CHARGE THESE VEHICLES. OF THE VEHICLES GET CLEANER EVERY YEAR BECAUSE THE ELECTRIC PORTFOLIOS CLEANING UP SO. LAST YEAR- WE HAD 63% OF THE ELECTRICITY. IN CALIFORNIA COMING FROM CARBON FREE SOURCES OBVIOUSLY WE'RE ON ROUTE. TWO HUNDRED PERCENT- NOW INCALIFORNIA AND SO THAT'S A NICE FEATURE- AS WELL- I DO WANNA. OUT THAT- YOU. MISTER SEEKING COULD A- AUTHORITY ALL FOR. THE BILL OUT OF THE SENTENCE THROUGH THE ENERGY. QUICK TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS. BILLION DOLLARS IT DOES NOT REALLY APPLY TO THE PROGRAM IS MANAGED BY. THE RESOURCES BOARD THAT- MY COLLEAGUE WILLIAM RANDOLPH IS GONNA TALK ABOUT- IN ADEPT SO THERE'S REALLY THREE FUNDING STREAMS FOR INFRASTRUCTURE THERE IS THE MONEY. YOU HAVE ASKED US TO DEPLOY AT THE ENERGY COMMISSION THROUGH THE CLEAN TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM. THERE IS THE MONEY. INVESTED BY UTILITIES WHICH MY COLLEAGUE CLIFF WRECK SHOP IS GOING TO BE SPEAKING ABOUT AND THERE'S MONEY FROM SETTLEMENTS LIKE OTHER B. W. SOMEONE LIKE FIVE ERICA. SO WE'RE WE ARE TODAY- WE HAVE SEVENTY THOUSAND GOAL FOR TWENTY TWENTY FIVE IS TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND. WE THAT'S ENOUGH TO SUPPORT A MILLION HAPPY OF COURSE WHICH IS THE- THE BILL WE BELIEVE WE'RE SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLAR CHARGER SHORT. OF THAT SO- THIS THIS FUNDING WE'RE TALKING ABOUT- WILL HELP. CLOSE THAT GAP BY TWENTY THIRTY THE GOAL IS TO HAVE ONE AND A HALF MILLION BY TWO CHARGERS AND TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND. HEAVY DUTY CHARGES TO SUPPORT A TOTAL OF EIGHT MILLION. ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES- IS TO GET A SENSE OF COST SO TYPICAL LEVEL TWO CHARGER. WHICH IS THAT'S THE VAST MAJORITY CHARGES GOING. WE SPENT ABOUT FORTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS PER CHARGER ON THAT THAT REPRESENTS ABOUT A THIRD OF THE COST- SO WE'RE WE'RE PROVIDING THIS INCENTIVE IN THE WE'RE LEVERAGING. PRIVATE INVESTMENT. FOR SCHOOL BUS IT'S SIX CAME THE CHARGE. TRANSIT BUS REYES FROM C. TO TWO THOUSAND- AND THEN DUTY. M. HEAVY DUTY- TO BE SIXTY ALL THE WAY UP TO TWO HUNDRED TWO THOUSAND- SO THERE'S A QUESTION EARLIER ABOUT HYDROGEN- WE HAVE FORTY FIVE HYDROGEN STATIONS ARE OPEN NOW THE GOAL FOR THE STATE THAT WE'RE PURSUING IS. TWO HUNDRED STATIONS BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE WE PROJECT AT THIS POINT WILL BE TWENTY ONE STATIONS SHORT BY THAT TIME HI THE AVERAGE COST FOR HYDROGEN STATION FOR US IS ONE POINT THREE MILLION IN THAT REPRESENTS ABOUT HALF OF THE COST THE TOTAL COST- I DID WANT TO MENTION AS WELL WE HAVE A GOAL THEIR TUITION TO DO 50% OF OUR CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE LOW INCOME AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES- AND I WOULD POINT OUT ONE. ONE POSITIVE DEVELOPING THIS HAPPENED LAST YEAR'S IS A REALLY HEALTHY RESALE MARKET A SECONDARY MARKET FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLES SO YOU CAN FIND OUT A USED NISSAN LEAF FOR FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS. LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS TYPICALLY NOT GOING TO BUY. A NEW VEHICLE ANYWHERE. FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS IS A IS A PRICE THAT DOES NOT WORK. WITHOUT UBIQUITOUS CHARGING AND SO REALLY. ARE WE WANT TO CHARGING TO BE LIKE. YOUR PHONE WHEN YOU GET A PHONE YOU NEVER WORRY ABOUT WHERE AM I GOING TO FIND LECTURES OPPONENTS UBIQUITOUS IN OUR- HOMES AND OFFICES AND WE HAVE TO GET THEIR PARTICULARLY FOR LOW INCOME SO I ACTUALLY SEE THE EQUITY INVESTMENT. AS A NECESSITY I SEE IT AS A AS A DANCE INSTRUCTOR JUST AS AN EQUITY STRATEGY ACTUALLY. I WANTED WHEN I WANT TO MENTION THAT IS ALSO THINK OF POSITIVE FEEDBACK CYCLE. IS THAT- ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING FOR THE FEW THINGS THAT. GIVES US ACTUALLY DOWNWARD FORCE ON ELECTRIC RATES SO. ALLERGIC VEHICLES HAVE ALREADY CONTRIBUTED ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS TO THE RATE BASE AND SO THAT'S WHAT IT WAS GOING TO THE OIL INDUSTRY IS NOW COMING IN. AND YOU'RE ABLE TO SPREAD THOSE FIXED COSTS OVER. MORE KILOWATT HOURS ENOUGH TO POWER FORCE WHICH IS A POSITIVE. A POSITIVE THING- I WILL JUST CLOSE BY SAYING YOU KNOW WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH CARPETS GOKU'S WITH THE PC. CURRENTLY USING PARTICULARLY I MEAN THEY HAVE TAKEN THEIR LUMPS- TO DEPART JOBS I REALLY WANT TO GIVE GREAT CREDIT TO EACH AGENCY. I DON'T BELIEVE WE WOULD BE WHERE WE ARE WITH THE PROGRESS WE'RE SEEING A NEW VEHICLE INTRODUCTIONS WITHOUT CARDS LEADERSHIP. AND THE INCREDIBLE WORK ON OF SANTA FE THEY HAVE MANAGED ON THE PC AS WELL HAS BEEN PUSHING I UNDERSTAND I THINK. OF THE UTILITY CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE THE PC'S INVESTMENTS- THE NOW REPRESENTS OVER HALF. OF THE- THE TOTAL YOU TO INVEST IN CHARGING SO I REALLY- INCREDIBLE WORK THERE. I WILL STOP THERE AND TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE SHARE- THE AND READ OFF FROM. THEIR RECENT SUPPORT. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN AND WELCOME CHIRLA RANDALL. GO RIGHT AHEAD. THANK YOU CHAIR HOTEL AND KIDNAPPED KARAGANDA AND SHE WHAT HOW INMEMBERS AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK HERE TODAY- I AM THE AND RANDOLPH CARE THEIR RESOURCES BOARD AND I'M GONNA BE TALKING ABOUT CARDI EFFORTS TO FACILITATE THE EQUITABLE TRANSITION TO ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES INCLUDING HYDROGEN FUEL CELL AND ELECTRIC VEHICLES. AND CARDS REGULATIONS AND PROGRAMS THAT SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S VERY MISSION VEHICLE EXECUTIVE ORDER. THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR INCLUDING PASSENGER VEHICLES HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS AND OFF ROAD VEHICLES AS WELL AS THE FIELD NEEDED TO POWER THEM IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MORE THAN HALF OF CALIFORNIA'S GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. PARTICULARLY IF YOU INCLUDE UPSTREAM EMISSIONS. ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MAJORITY OF SMOG CAUSING POLLUTANTS AND IS A SIGNIFICANTSOURCE OF TOXIC AIR CONTAMINANTS THAT DIRECTLY IMPACT COMMUNITY HEALTH. TODAY OVER TWELVE MILLION CALIFORNIANS BREATHE UNHEALTHY AIR. IN SEVERAL AREAS OF THE STATE ARE STILL IN NON ATTAINMENT WITH NATIONAL AMBIENT AIR QUALITY STANDARDS. EXPOSURE TO OZONE AND PARTICULATE MATTER LEADS TO A RANGE OF RESPIRATORY AND CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH IMPACTS. INCLUDING EXACERBATIONS OF ASTHMA AND HEART DISEASE IT IS ESTIMATED TO CONTRIBUTE TO APPROXIMATELY SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED PREMATURE DEATHS IN CALIFORNIA EACH YEAR. CLEAN AIR AND REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS ARE NECESSARY TO ENSURE THE HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF CALIFORNIANS AND OUR NATURAL ENVIRONMENT. AS WELL AS TO AVOID AND MITIGATE THE MOST SEVERE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE. PGG REDUCTIONS NEEDED TO MEET THE SENATE BILL THIRTY TWO CLIMATE TARGET BY TWENTY THIRTY IN ADDITION TO THE CARBON NEUTRALITY GOAL BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE ARE SIGNIFICANT. R. B. OXIDES OF. MICHIGAN OR NOT IN PARTICULAR IT MATTER EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS NEEDED TO MEET AMBIENT AIR QUALITY STANDARDS FOR OZONE AND PARTICULATE MATTER. GIVEN THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR CONSTITUTES THE LARGEST SOURCE OF EMISSIONS IN CALIFORNIA WE MUST TAKE AGGRESSIVE STEPS TO ACCELERATE THE TRANSITION TO ZERO EMISSION TECHNOLOGIES AND MOBILITY OPTION. IMPORTANCE OF THIS DATA OF TRANSITION IS EVIDENCED BY VEHICLE MANUFACTURERS EFFORTS TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF STAFF MODELS AVAILABLE AND THE GROWING NUMBER OF STATES IN CITY DEDUCTING TARGETS. SIMILAR TO CALIFORNIANS. I HOPE HE'LL DISCUSS WE'VE SEEN CONSIDERABLE PROGRESS IN ADVANCING JERRY MISSION TECHNOLOGY AND BRINGING IN A VARIETY OF CLEANER VEHICLES TO THE MARKET. HOWEVER THE INCREASINGLY SEVERE IMPACTS OF THE CLIMATE CRISIS AND THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON OUR ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITIES. AS WELL AS THE UNEVEN ACCESS TO CLEAN TRANSPORTATION FOR THESE COMMUNITIES HIGHLIGHTS THE NEED TO ACCELERATE THIS TRANSITION. WHAT CALIFORNIA HAS ESTABLISH AMBITIOUS AIR QUALITY CLIMATE CHANGE AND JEFF DEPLOYMENT GOALS. WE REALLY MUST DEVELOP THESE POLICIES IN ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY USING IT A STRONG EQUITY IN LAND SO THAT NO COMMUNITY IS LEFT BEHIND. SO IN A LIGHT DUTY SPACE CARBON'S DEVELOPED AND IS DEVELOPING A NUMBER OF REGULATIONS AND COMPLIMENTARY INCENTIVE PROGRAMS THAT WILL SUPPORT THE TRANSITION TO THAT. THE LIGHT DUTY VEHICLE TARGET IN DEFINITIONS THAT EXECUTIVE ORDER WILL BE A KEY DRIVER IN CAR NEW. ADVANCE CLEAN MILES- DANCING CARS REGULATION CURRENTLY UNDER DEVELOPMENT. OUR SUITE OF CLEAN TRANSPORTATION INCENTIVES BUILT UPON A REGULATORY FRAMEWORK BY REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS IMPROVING AIR QUALITY PROTECTING PRIORITY COMMUNITIES AND REDUCING PETROLEUM DEPENDENCY. THE CLEAN MILE STANDARD REGULATION WHICH IS ESTABLISHED THREE SENATOR SKINNER SB TEN FOURTEEN. WILL ALSO SUPPORT THE TRANSITION HEARING MISSION TECHNOLOGY. THIS REGULATION WILL ESTABLISH AGGRESSIVE ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED TARGETS THAT WILL REQUIRE TRANSPORTATION NETWORK COMPANIES SUCH AS UBER AND LEFT TO TRANSITION THEIR FLEETS TO SAYS STARTING IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE AND RAMPING UP THROUGH TWENTY THIRTY. IN ADDITION THE CLEAN MOUTH STANDARD IS ALSO DESIGNED TO ENCOURAGE PULLING ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION AND CONNECTIONS TO PUBLIC TRANSIT WHICH PROMOTE INCREASE ACCESS TO TRANSPORTATION OPPORTUNITIES. TO CLEAN MY HOUSE STANDARD IS EXPECTED TO RESULT IN CUMULATIVE REDUCTION OF MORE THAN ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION METRIC TONS OF CARBON DIOXIDE BETWEEN TWENTY TWENTY THREE AND TWENTY THIRTY ONE. ANOTHER PROGRAM IS THE CLEAN FUELS REWARD. WHICH REPLACES EXISTING EASY REBATES AND INCENTIVES OFFERED BY ELECTRIC DISTRIBUTION UTILITIES SUCH AS HIGHER USE AND THE PUBLICLY OWNED UTILITIES TO THEIR CUSTOMERS FUNDED BY THEIR LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD CREDIT PROCEED. THE CREAMFIELDS REWARDS STREAMLINES THE PROCESS OF PAYING OUT THESE REBATE AND MAKES THEM AVAILABLE AT THE POINT OF SALE WITH THE ADDED BENEFIT OF MAKING THE PROCESS AND INCENTIVES CONSISTENT STATEWIDE AND AVAILABLE TO ALL CALIFORNIANS. AS SENATOR WHITE HOUSE YOU MENTIONED AN INCENTIVE ON THE HOOD THAT'S QUICK AND EASY YEARS. CLEAN TRANSPORTATION INCENTIVE PROGRAMS AND INVESTMENTS WILL ALSO CONTINUE TO PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN GENERAL WHERE NASH DEPLOYMENT AND ADOPTION. FOR EXAMPLE THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET WOULD PROVIDE SEVENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS FOR PROGRAMS LIKE CLEAN CARS FOR ALL WHICH HAS RESULTED IN HELPING LOWER INCOME INDIVIDUALS AND HELPFUL. REPLACED ELEVEN THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED OLD HIGHER POLLUTING VEHICLES WITH MORE RELIABLE BATTERY ELECTRIC AND PLUG IN HYBRID ELECTRIC VEHICLE. THE HEAVY DUTY SECTOR IS ALSO CRITICAL TO THE STRATEGY. CARP HAS ESTABLISHED PROGRAMS AND REGULATIONS TO FACILITATE THE TRANSITION OF THE HEAVY DUTY SECTOR BECAUSE OF TECHNOLOGY. HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS UNIT ONE THIRD OF STATEWIDE KNOX EMISSIONS AND A QUARTER OF STATE MY DIESEL PM EMISSIONS REDUCING EMISSIONS FROM HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES IS CRITICAL TO MEETING THE STATE ALL. THIS TRANSITION IS ESSENTIAL TO IMPROVING AIR QUALITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITIES WHICH ARE OFTEN SURROUNDED BY WAREHOUSES HIGHWAYS PORTS AND OTHER EMISSIONS. CORPORATION SURE THAT MANUFACTURERS ARE MAKING THE NECESSARY INVESTMENTS TO SUPPORT A FULL TRANSITION TO ZERO EMISSION TECHNOLOGY IN THE HEAVY DUTY SECTOR INCREASED CLEATS THE INSURANCE THAT THEY WILL HAVE QUALITY PRODUCTS AVAILABLE FOR MANUFACTURERS. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN CARBON DOT THAT ITS FIRST HEAVY DUTY ZERO EMISSION REGULATION THE INNOVATIVE CLEAN TRANSIT REGULATION WHICH IS DESIGNED TO TRANSITION THE STATE'S TRANSIT FLEET TO ZERO EMISSION BY TWENTY FORTY THROUGH A PURCHASE REQUIREMENT. THE REGULATION WILL COMPLETELY ELECTRIFIED IN STATE FLEET OF ROUGHLY FOURTEEN THOUSAND TRANSIT BUSES AND IS EXPECTED TO RDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS BY NINETY MILLION METRIC TONS BY TWENTY FIFTY. IN TWENTY NINETEEN HARBOR DR THE HEARING MISSION AIRPORT SHUTTLE BUS REGULATION WHICH WILL TRANSITION THE STATE AIRPORT SHUTTLE FLEET HE GERRY MISSION. AS WELL AS THE HEARING MISSION POWER TRAIN CERTIFICATION REGULATION. WHICH ENSURES MANUFACTURERS ARE PRODUCING. QUALITY PRODUCTS FOR CONSUMERS AND FLEETS. THE BOARD APPROVED THE ADVANCE CLEAN TRUCKS REGULATION IN TWENTY TWENTY THIS REGULATION REQUIRES pMANUFACTURERS TO PRODUCE AND SELL MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY SAYS CALIFORNIA BEGINNING WITH THE TWENTY TWENTY FOUR MODEL YEAR. DESERVE SALES REQUIREMENT UNDER THIS REGULATION RAMPS UP THROUGH THE TWENTY THIRTY FIVE MODEL YEAR. AND THIS REGULATION IS ANTICIPATED TO RESULT IN THE DEPLOYMENT OF ROUGHLY THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND JERRY MISSION TRACKS BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE. I WAS ALSO WORKING ON FUTURE REGULATIONS THAT WILL FOCUS ON JERRY MISSION REFRIGERATED TRUCKS AND TRAILERS. CARGO HANDLING EQUIPMENT FORKLIFTS AND LOCOMOTIVES. IN ADDITION TO THESE REGULATIONS CARBS DEMONSTRATION AND PILOT PROGRAMS HAVE ILLUSTRATED THE FEASIBILITY OF HEARING MISSION TECHNOLOGY FOR USE IN A WIDE VARIETY OF TRUCKS AND BUSES. SEVERAL CAR PROGRAMS ARE INCREASING DEPLOYMENT AS AS INCLUDING THE HYBRID. AND ZERO EMISSION TRUCK AND BUSTED OUT YOUR INCENTIVE PROGRAM MANAGE H. FAT WHICH PROVIDES POINT OF SALE VOUCHERS FOR FLEET TO BUY CLEAN FEEL. SCREEN VEHICLE. THE FARMER PROGRAM WHICH PROVIDES FUNDING THROUGH LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS TO REPLACE OLD HIGH EMITTING AGRICULTURAL EQUIPMENT THIS NEW LOW EMISSION CLEAN EQUIPMENT. ZERO AND NEAR ZERO EMISSION FREE FACILITY PROGRAM WHICH PROVIDES GRANT FUNDS TO PROJECTS THAT ACCELERATE ADOPTION OF CLEAN FREE TECHNOLOGIES AND REDUCE AIR POLLUTION CAUSED THANK ITS MOVEMENT. AND I REALLY WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THE NECESSITY OF AN EQUITABLE TRANSITION TO ZERO EMISSION TECHNOLOGY AND ADOPTION OF CLEAN TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS. WELL THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND AIR POLLUTION AFFECTS ALL OF US THOSE WHO LIVE IN DISADVANTAGED AREAS AND LOW INCOME AREAS ARE ESPECIALLY VULNERABLE AND FACE THE MOST SEVERE IMPACTS. CALIFORNIA HAS SET AMBITIOUS EV DEPLOYMENT TARGETS AND IT IS CRUCIAL WE ACTIVELY SUPPORT COMMUNITIES AND PROVIDE THEM WITH RESOURCES THEY NEED FOR THIS TRANSITION. TO TAKE STRATEGIC STEPS TO MEET COMMUNITY IDENTIFIED TRANSPORTATION NEEDS. AS OF TECHNOLOGIES IN THE MARKET PRETTY TECHNOLOGIES CONTINUE TO DEVELOP STEPS WILL BECOME INCREASINGLY AFFORDABLE. AS HAS BEEN DISCUSSED THIS AFTERNOON THE COSTA DOES HAS DECREASED IN RECENT YEARS AND IS EXPECTED TO DECLINE MORE RAPIDLY IN THE FUTURE. STUDIES ESTIMATE THAT BY TWENTY THIRTY THE COST OF OWNING ANDOPERATING AS A WILL BE LOWER THAN THAT OF OWNING A GASOLINE OR DIESEL. VEHICLE WE REALIZE THAT WE NEED TO MEET COMMUNITIES WHERE THEY ARE TO PROVIDE AFFORDABLE. SAFE CLEAN TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS AND MUST DO MORE TO ENSURE THAT THOSE TECHNOLOGIES ARE AVAILABLE AND AFFORDABLE. THE CARD SAYS PROGRAMS ARE DESIGNED TO IMPROVE SOCIAL EQUITY BY ENSURING THAT THE BENEFITS OF TECHNOLOGY ADVANCEMENTS AND CLEAN TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS ARE SHARED BY ALL CALIFORNIANS. FOR EXAMPLE I MENTIONED THE CLEAN CARS FOR ALL PROGRAM WHICH IS ONE OF OUR VEHICLE PURCHASE INCENTIVE PROGRAMS. PARTICIPANTS WERE LOCATED IN LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS OUR COMMUNITY. HI BEEN VESTED A SUITE OF CLEAN TRANSPORTATION AND MOBILITY EQUITY PROJECTS TO COMPLEMENT VEHICLE PURCHASE INCENTIVES AND ADDRESS THE BROADER TRANSPORTATION NEEDS. CARBS CLEAN MOBILITY OPTIONS PROJECT INCLUDE PROJECTS INCLUDE THE NEWLY LAUNCHED STATEWIDE CLEAN MOBILITY OPTIONS VOUCHER PROGRAM. OR CMO AS WELL AS OTHER LOCAL AND REGIONAL INVESTMENT. BMO PROVIDE FUNDING FOR SMALL SCALE PROJECTS SUCH AS ZERO EMISSION CAR SHARING BIKE SHARING INNOVATIVE TRANSIT SERVICES AND COMMUNITY TRANSPORTATION NEEDS. THE SUSTAINABLE TRANSPORTATION EQUITY PROJECT OR STEP PROVIDE FUNDING FOR LARGER SCALE PLANNING CAPACITYIN PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION GRANTS THAT FURTHER ADDRESS COMMUNITY NEEDS INCREASE ACCESS AND REDUCE VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED. CENTRAL TO CARD EQUITY INVESTMENT STRATEGY IS COMMUNITY OUTREACH EDUCATION AND ENGAGEMENT. ACCESS CLEAN CALIFORNIA FORMALLY KNOWN AS A ONE STOP SHOP PILOT PROJECT YOU STREAMLINING ACCESS TO AND COORDINATING OUTREACH FOR CARDS CONSUMER FACING PROGRAMS INCLUDING CLEANING CARS FOR ALL AND OTHER PROGRAMS. INVESTMENT IN HEAVY DUTY VEHICLE PROGRAM IS INTENDED TO ACCELERATE DEPLOYMENT. DEVELOPMENT A DEPLOYMENT OF CLEAN TECHNOLOGY TO IMPROVE AIR QUALITY AND ENHANCE ACCESS TO CLEAN TRANSPORTATION. IN ADDITION TO STANDARD VOUCHERS PROVIDED THROUGH EACH STEP AS I MENTIONED EARLIER CARP ALSO PROVIDES SATCHER ENHANCEMENTS FOR HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES DEPLOYED IN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND AS A RESULT OVER TWO THIRDS OF THE H. THAT THAT'S YOUR FUNDING HAS BEEN INVESTED IN PRIORITY. POPULATION WELL IT DEFINITELY UNDERCARDS FARMER PROGRAM AROUND 65% OF PROGRAM FUNDS SPENT TO DATE HAVE BENEFITTED PRIORITY POPULATIONS. INCLUDING INCENTIVE FUNDING FOR AGRICULTURAL HARVESTING EQUIPMENT HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS AND OTHER EQUIPMENT SED IN AGRICULTURAL OPERATIONS. SO THROUGH THIS SUITE OF LIGHT AND HEAVY DUTY VEHICLE PROGRAMS HARBAGE WORKING TO ENSURE HISTORICALLY OVERBURDENED COMMUNITIES AND LOW INCOME HOUSES HELPFUL OUR PRIORITY IN THIS TRANSITION. I'D LIKE TO CLOSE BY REITERATING CARDS COMMENT COMMITMENT TO TRANSITIONING TO TRANSPORTATION SECRETARY MISSION. AND WORKING WITH THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE TO ACHIEVE THIS AND DURING THIS AND FUTURE. THANK YOU AND I'LL HAND THE FLOOR OVER TO COMMISSIONER ACCEPTANCE. THANK YOU CHAIRWOMAN RANDOLPH WELCOME COMMISSIONER REX OFTEN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR GONZALEZ THE WHITE HOUSE YOU KNOW OTHER MEMBERS I'M CLOSE FRANK JOHNSON ON THE C. P. UC'S COMMISSIONER ON ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE DEPLOYMENT I WANT TO ECHO THE THANKS OF MY COLLEAGUES WILL READ THE STRONG LEADERSHIP OF THE LEGISLATURE IN THIS AREA. AND. FRIDAY AFTERNOON TO- TO DELVE INTO THESE. HELD BY HIM PORTENT ISSUES THE P. YOU SEE OF COURSE THIS IS THE PRIMARY REGULATOR OF OUR ELECTRIC AUDIO USE AND AS SUCH HAS SEVERAL KEY ROLES IN SUPPORTING OUR TRANSITIONS DESERVES THAT I'LL TALK ABOUT CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE DEPLOYMENT. ELECTRICITY RATES AND FUEL COSTS VEHICLE GREAT INTEGRATION AND INTER AGENCY COORDINATION ICING COVERED THE COORDINATION VERY WELL IT EXTENDS TO MANY RELATED PROCEEDINGS BEYOND THE IMMEDIATE SEPT PROCEEDINGS I WILL TALK MORE ABOUT THAT. I'LL DESCRIBE THESE OTHER ROLES IN THE SECOND I DO WANT TO MENTION THAT AS PART OF OUR EFFORT TO BEST COORDINATE WHAT WE DO WITH THE PC IN TWENTY NINETEEN WE OPENED UP A COMPREHENSIVE PUBLIC DOCKET TO EXAMINE THE ROLE OF UTILITY INVESTMENTS AND OTHER ACTIONS UTILITIES NEED TO TAKE AS WE ELECTRIFY OUR TRANSPORTATION SECTOR AND THAT INCLUDES MAKING SURE THAT THEY ARE PREPARED. FOR THIS SUBSTANTIAL GROWTH IN THE ELECTRICAL- THAT'S GOING TO RESULT FROM WIDESPREAD. ADOPTION OF SENSE. A CENTER PARK OF THE PROCEEDING A CENTRAL OBJECTIVE OF OURS WAS TO STREAMLINE THE PROCESS THESE WE FOLLOW FOR APPROVING UTILITY INFRASTRUCTURE. INVESTMENT SO AS PART OF THAT PROCEEDING WITH ISSUED A DRAFT FRAMEWORK WE'VE BEEN GETTING STAKEHOLDER FEEDBACK ON IT WE EXPECT TO ISSUE SEVERAL DECISIONS THROUGHOUT THIS YEAR THE FIRST ONE PROBABLY THE NEXT TWO OR THREE MONTHS. I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT AS WE'VE BEEN WORKING THROUGH THIS MORE COMPREHENSIVE LOOK AND FRAMEWORK FOR UTILITY INVESTMENT WE HAVE CONTINUED TO EVALUATE AND APPROVE UTILITY PROGRAMS BOTH OF THOSE PROGRAMS HAVE COME. THROUGH THE AUTHORIZATION PROVIDED BY THE LEGISLATURE IN SB THREE FIFTY SO LET ME TALK NOW ABOUT THOSE FOUR MAIN ROLES THE FIRST IS CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE DEPLOYMENT. OVER THE PAST FOUR YEARS WE'VE AUTHORIZED UTILITIES TO INVEST ALMOST ONE POINT FIVE BILLION A ZERO EMISSION INFRASTRUCTURE JUST TO GIVE SOME CONTEXT FOR THAT I KNOW CENTER GONZALEZ AZT SO I MEAN ABOUT THIS AND SHE HOPES SHE'LL MENTION THIS. THE FIG FOR THE ENTIRE COUNTRY OF ALL TWENTY FIVE PLUS STATES THAT HAVE AUTHORIZED UTILITY INVESTMENT. THE TOTAL FIGURES TWO POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS CALIFORNIA ALONE HAS AUTHORIZED ONE POINT FIVE BILLION OF THAT TWO POINT FOUR BILLION AMOUNT SO FAR. ABOUT HALF OF THE INVESTMENT HAS BEEN IN INFRASTRUCTURE. THE CHARGE MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES THAT IS A PRIORITY FOR THE REASONS MY COLLEAGUES HAVE ARTICULATED. THOSE VEHICLES DISPROPORTIONATELY BECAUSE POLLUTION IN HEAVILY BURDENED COMMUNITIES ALREADY THE OTHER HALF IS BEEN IN WORKPLACE AND PUBLIC CHARGING STATIONS. FOR LIGHT DUTY ELECTRIC VEHICLES PUBLIC CHARGING STATION JUST REFERS TO THINGS THAT THE PUBLIC HAS ACCESS TO AS OPPOSED TO SOMEONE'S PERSONAL GARAGE OR DRIVEWAY. WE HAVE A VERY STRONG FOCUS ON EQUITY EVERY PROGRAM WAS APPROVED IN THE PAST FOUR YEARS HAS RECORDED ANYWHERE FROM TWENTY FIVE. 52% OF ALL INVESTMENTS. IN UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES OUR MOST RECENT DECISIONS HAVE REQUIRED 50% OF INVESTMENT BE. IT IN THOSE COMMUNITIES. WE'VE ALSO BEEN FOCUSING ON THE OST DIFFICULT BARRIERS THE MOST DIFFICULT MARKET SEGMENTS TWO ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE ADOPTION. THAT INCLUDES INFRASTRUCTURE FOR RENTERS AND OCCUPANTS OF MULTI FAMILY BUILDINGS. THEY RELY ON SHARED A PUBLIC CHARGING OR COULD BE WORKPLACE CHARGING IN ORDER TO FUEL THEIR VEHICLE. WE IMPLEMENTED THE REQUIREMENTS OF TWO BILLS FROM THE LEGISLATURE AB TEN EIGHTY TWO IN TEN EIGHTY THREE THOSE AUTHORIZED INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAMS AT SCHOOLS STATE BEACHES AND PARKS. LAST MONTH WE ISSUED A PROPOSED DECISION OR IMPROVING EXPANSION OF SAN DIEGO GAS AND ELECTRIC'S PROGRAM FOR WORKPLACES IN MULTI FAMILY UNITS. IN SEPTEMBER OF LAST YEAR WE AUTHORIZED SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON TO SPEND ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ON A SIMILAR PROGRAM THAT IS BY FAR AND AWAY THE LARGEST UTILITY INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAM. IN THE COUNTRY. WE ARE ALSO CURRENTLY IMPLEMENTING A BILL THAT YOU FOR THE LEGISLATURE PASSED LAST YEAR AB EIGHT FORTY ONE A SETTLEMENT KINGS BILL THAT CHANGES THE REVIEW PROCESS FOR HOW WE ANALYZE COST UTILITIES IN CORE. TO INSTALL INFRASTRUCTURE ON THEIR CITED THE METER AND WE HAVE A DECISION OUT PROPOSING HOW TO DO THAT- TALK ABOUT RATES AND FUEL COSTS OBVIOUSLY ELECTRICITY ELECTED GRACE THE COST OF FUEL VEHICLE. CAN HAVE A VERY SUBSTANTIAL IMPACT ON OUR CUSTOMERS DECISION ABOUT WHETHER TO PURCHASE A VEHICLE AND HOW MUCH IT COSTS TO OPERATE IT. IMPORTANTLY ELECTRIC VEHICLES CAN OFFER REAL SAVINGS COMPARED TO CONVENTIONAL VEHICLES. WE HAVE BEEN WORKING VERY HARD TO DESIGN AND IMPLEMENT A VARIETY OF RATES FOR BOTH COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL CUSTOMERS AND RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMERS. ALL THREE OF OUR LARGE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES NOW OFFER EVEY RATES FOR COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL CUSTOMERS. THAT ADDRESS VERY IMPORTANT COST BARRIERS THAT WERE KEEPING THEM FROM ELECTRIFYING. LOOTING DEMAND CHARGES YEAH AND THAT IN PARTICULAR IS RESPONSIVE TO LEGISLATIVE DIRECTION THAT WE ADDRESSED AREAS LIKE DEMAND CHARGES. THE UTILITIES ALL ALSO OFFER EVEY RATES TO RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMERS BETTER DESIGNED TO ENCOURAGE THEM TO CHARGE AT TIMES THAT ARE MOST BENEFICIAL OR LESS STRESSFUL THE GREAT SUCH AS OVERNIGHT. AND THAT ALSO SAVE CONSUMERS MONEY SO FOR EXAMPLE FOR EACH OF THE MAJOR UTILITIES IN THE STATE. RESIDENTIAL DRIVERS WHO CHARGE OFF PEAK AGAIN TYPICALLY OVERNIGHT THEY CAN CHARGE THEIR CARS AT ONE THIRD TO ONE HALF THE COST OF FUELING THEIR CAR AT A GAS STATION. THE THIRD AREA AS VERY PROMISING AREAS THAT WERE DEVELOPING AND ALSO WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE ENERGY COMMISSION ON HIS VEHICLE GRID INTEGRATION IT'S A BUZZWORD IT'S THINGS WE WILL BE LOOKING FOR ALL EVERY EVERY YEAR WE KEEP THINKING IT'S NEXT YEAR BUT IT IS COMING SOONER RATHER THAN LATER. AND BROADLY SPEAKING IT REFERS TO POLICIES AND BEHAVIORS THAT SHAPE CHARGING BEHAVIOR IN A WAY THAT BOTH MAXIMIZE BENEFITS TO THE GRID. AND SAVE CUSTOMERS MONEY THAT COULD BE AS SIMPLE AS SMART CHARGING WHICH IS CHARGING AT TIMES THAT ARE BEST FOR THE GRADE. AND MORE SOPHISTICATED TO CAN BE VEHICLE ACTS AS A BATTERY AND FEEDING POWER BACK TO THE GREAT AT TIMES IT IS MOST NEEDED. LAST DECEMBER WE ISSUED A MAJOR DECISION IMPLEMENTING CENTER BRADFORD STILL SB SIX SEVENTY SIX THAT OUTLINES STRATEGIES FOR VEHICLE GRID INTEGRATION DEVELOPMENT. METRICS TO USE. THE MEASURE SUCCESS OF THESE PROGRAMS AND WE AUTHORIZED ABOUT THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN. ISLETS WERE CONTINUING TO WORK TO ADDRESS BARRIERS TO SCALE BGI- TO ENSURE THAT ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING IS OPTIMIZED WITH GREAT CONDITIONS. AND THEN LAST- INDICATED AS AS AS A TYSON MADE CLEAR WE'RE VERY ACTIVELY COORDINATING WITH OTHER STATE AGENCIES FOR ALL THESE EFFORTS THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME AND I'M NOW GOING TO. TURN IT BACK TO TYSON TO CLOSE. THANK YOU COMMISSIONER. GREAT WELL THANK YOU EVERYBODY I THINK THAT ALL THESE OTHER BREATH YOU KNOW FOR THAT FROM OUR LEAD AGENCIES I THINK BUT IT HAD IT BACK TO YOU AT CHAIR GONZALEZ- FOR YOUR FOR YOUR QUESTION SO WE APPRECIATE THE TIME. AND BILL THE TALK THIS THROUGH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- SO WE WILL THAT. CONCLUDES THE SECOND PANEL SO WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD AND CLICK OUT FOR MEMBER QUESTIONS. AND WE HAVE SENATOR WHAT KOWSKI FOR FIRST QUESTION GO RIGHT AHEAD CENTER C. THANK YOU FOR THE FEDERAL A PRESENTATION ARE. SO WHERE WE ACT ON HOW IS THE STATE'S INVESTMENTS- BEEN SCORED BY THE DIFFERENT AGENCIES ARE PAPER SAYS AT THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY WE HAVE EXACTLY FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY SEVEN THOUSAND ELECTRIC VEHICLES ON THE ROAD. WE ALL KNOW THAT WE HAVE ARE THE NEVER USES THIRTY MILLION SO WE GOT ONE SIXTIETH OF THE VEHICLES AFTER ALL THESE PROGRAMS WE'VE GONE THROUGH EACH OF YOU HAVE HIGHLIGHTED ALL THE DIFFERENT THINGS YOU DOING. ALL THE PROCEEDINGS THAT ARE GOING ON HOW DO WE EVALUATE THE COSTS THAT THAT HAS TO THE STATE. AND THEN THE OBVIOUS QUESTION AFTER THAT IS HOW DOES THE BUDGET THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. MOVE THE NEEDLE ON THOSE THINGS I MEAN IT'S NICE TO TALK I'M BLEEDING HEART LIBERAL SOME OF THE STUFF YOU SAID BRINGS TEARS TO MY EYES I THINK I'M DOING THE RIGHT THING I FELT SO RIGHTEOUS BEING THE SENATOR VOTING FOR THOSE. BUT ARE WE- PRODUCING THE RESULTS THAT WE FIND SO DESIRABLE. YEAH SO I THINK ONE THING ON THE NUMBER AND YOU KNOW THAT FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY SEVEN THOUSAND THAT WAS IN THE- THE SENATE REPORT SEATED NUMBER WE USE EIGHT HUNDRED AND THREE THOUSAND YOU KNOW GOOD BECAUSE INCLUDES PLUG IN HYBRID ELECTRIC VEHICLES THE TIME AND SO IT JUST DEPENDS ON THE SEMANTICS OF USE THAT NUMBER. WE'RE PRETTY CLOSE TO THE ONE MILLION TARGETS AND IF YOU- IN A DEAL IN YOUR GROWTH PASSED- TWENTY TWENTY FIVE EIGHT RUN TRACK ABOUT ONE POINT FIVE MILLION CITY BUT START THERE MANY OF MY CO PANELISTS BECAUSE WHEN TO JUMP AND. I THINK IT'S AN UNEQUIVOCAL YES- NOT JUST FROM. THE VEHICLE BEING DEPLOYED BUT ALSO FROM THE VEHICLES BEING MANUFACTURED WITH SEVENTY THOUSAND. EMPLOYEES NOW IN THIS SPACE AND WE'RE GROWING AS IMAGES OF NUMBER ONE EXPORT LAST YEAR. I THINK WE'RE JUST AT THE- EARLY EARLY PHASE OF THIS- SO THE STATE IS WELL POSITIONED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS IMAGES EXAMPLE. NO PROTERRA AND DIVERT IT MAKING BUSES AND SELLING THOSE INTO FORTY STATES YOU'RE SEEING. YOU KNOW. THE STATE'S YOU WOULDN'T THINK WOULD BE BY ELECTRIC BUSES ACCEPTOR LINE OF TEXAS AND- PLACES LIKE THAT BY THE END. OF THE BATTERY PACKS A MAJOR THE BUSES ARE MADE HERE SO. ALL OF THIS INDIAN WIRE THOSE COMPANIES HERE ITS PROXIMITY TO THE MARKET. IF YOU TALK TO CEOS AND I HAVE. THAT IS ONE OF THE MAIN KIT TO MAKE SO I JUST I THINK THAT MANUFACTURING IS A PARTICULARLY EXCITING. THING TO REMEMBER WHEN ORDERED ECONOMIC RECOVERY- AND YOU KNOW JUST GENERALLY. THE WAY THE COSTS COME DOWN- FOR TECHNOLOGY. IS REALLY SIMPLE BUT IT'S THREE THINGS ITS INNOVATION AUTOMATION AND SCALE. AND ALL THREE OF THOSE HABITS REALLY THE POLICY IS DRIVING THE SCALE SO. I THINK WE'RE ON A- VERY GOOD GLIDE PATH TO YOU KNOW TO REACH OUR GOALS BUT JUST MAKING. IT IS. CHEAPER OVER TIME AND THEN- YOU KNOW THE VEHICLE SENATE'S WILL WIND DOWN THAT'S A TEMPORARY EXERCISE. I I'M JUST READING THE EXECUTIVE ORDERS AN EXECUTIVE ORDER SAY XABSI NOT P. H. E. V. SO THERE'S- WHETHER IT'S FOUR HUNDRED EIGHT HUNDRED. YOU KNOW. HOW WE WANNA. COUNT THINGS. IS I. A THE FOR UP TO THE WERE NOT THERE BECAUSE- COMMISSION YOU INTO. TO YOUR SUBSIDY. THE BAD CHARGERS AT FOUR THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED. HE SAID I THINK I GOT THAT AND I GOT THE SMALL COMPANY IN MY DISTRICT ARE WORK THE TOWN WHERE I LIVE THEY'RE SELLING TESLA SELLING. BATTERY CHARGES FOR FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY WHAT'S THE WHY IS THAT WHAT'S- YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A PRIVATE CHARTERED SERVICE HOME WE DON'T FUND PROJECTS THIS IS. PUBLIC CHARGERS THAT WE'RE HAVING TO GET THE POWER TO THE SITE YOU KNOW BUILD A- FACILITY TO HOLD IT SO IT'S A DIFFERENT KETTLE OF FISH. TO HOLD. THREE WHAT YOU'RE SEEING ARE RIGHT SO- YOU CAN BY CHARGING FOR HOUSE FOR DRUGS THAT'S NOT WHAT WE PAID FOR WE ONLY PROVIDE. NO PUBLIC CHARGING- AND THAT'S WHAT THE WITH THE FORTY FIVE HUNDRED IS OUR COST. THE ALL ENCOMPASSES ABOUT THREE TIMES SINCE WE PAID ABOUT. ONE THIRD OF THE TOTAL. I GUESS MANAGER IS AN ACT FROM THE AGENCIES. WHAT STEPS GOING FORWARD CAN THEY TAKE- ON THE ROAD TO TRY TO. CLOSE THE GAP YEAH WE'VE WE TEND TO PASS A LOT OF BILLS THAT WE GOT THESE GOOD IDEAS WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO BUT- YOU KNOW YOU'VE IDENTIFIED SOME OF THE GAPS. IN THE CURRENT PROGRAMS AND IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE DUG THE BOULDER- WE WANT. AND WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN NEW LEGISLATION THAT NEEDS TO OCCUR AND HOW THEY CAN BE AGENCIES INDEPENDENTLY CAN- WORK ON THEIR OWN. WHO WOULD LIKE TO TAKE THAT QUESTION. SEVEN OKAY SAID IN TERMS OF WHAT WE CAN DO IS AGES I MEAN THERE'S A LOT OF LEVERS WE CAN YOU CAN AND ARE HOLDING UP ADVANCED MRK AT THE NOTES THAT. BIG FOCUS ON EQUITY PROGRAMS GETTING OURS GREEN CARS AND THE PEOPLE WHO NEED IT MOST THE MOBILITY. IT'S UTILITY INVESTMENTS PERMITTING WE GET A LOT OF WORK ON AN INFRASTRUCTURE PERMITTED BUILD OUT THE STATIONS AND MORE QUICKLY REDUCING THE SOFT COSTS- IT'S REALLY KIND OF SWEET OF EVERYTHING THAT YOU'VE YOU'VE HEARD. YEAR IT'S YOU KNOW THE STATE OF STATE CONTRACTS THAT TIME MUNICIPALITIES IF MANAGE UP TO BUY AND- YOU KNOW SPACE LIKE LOOKING AT MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY IT'S- I'M- LISTENING GO ON AND ON. BUT I THINK BAY. THERE'S A LOT OF ROOM FOR OPTIMISM AND IS LOOKING AT THE STATS YOU TALK ABOUT INVESTMENT AT THIS MORNING. LAST YEAR IN TWENTY TWENTY THERE IS FIFTY SIX POINT SEVEN SIX BILLION DOLLARS INVESTED ENDED ELECTRIC VEHICLE. RELATED COMPANIES IN THE GLOBALLY. THIRTY ONE POINT THREE THREE BILLION ABOUT A 55% CAME TO CALIFORNIA WHICH IS PRETTY EXCITING BECAUSE OF THIS POLICIES WITH THIS YEAR IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE TODAY WE'VE HAD ABOUT A LITTLE OVER NINETEEN BILLION. AND FIFTEEN BILLION OF THAT IT'S COME TO CALIFORNIA SO THAT'S THE A 76% SO WE'RE REALLY LEADING LEADING THE WAY AND I THINK THAT'S- THIS IS ONE SIGN YOU KNOW THE OTHER PART THAT'S COMING CERTAIN THE A LOT MORE. ADVERTISING YOU KNOW IT THAT THIS IS A REAL PRODUCT ANALYSIS YOU KNOW WILL FERRELL'S IN THE GAME B. W. HAS A SUITE OF COMMERCE IS OUT THERE BUT IT'S REALLY APPLYING TO. HIGH MASS MARKET AND SO I THINK THAT'S KIND OF THE PART OF THE PIVOT POINT THEY WERE LOOKING FOR. CAN I. JUST ADD. THEM JUST REALLY PRE. AND I THINK YOU CALIFORNIA'S A GREAT EXAMPLE OF HOW. YOU KNOW THE REGULATORY- ACTIONS DRIVE THE PRODUCTS- WHICH DRIVES THE- DEPLOYMENT WHICH DRIVE THE MARKET- WHICH- AS YOU SEE. WITH YOU KNOW AN OUNCE MEANS BY AUTOMAKERS. TALKING ABOUT THEIR GOALS FOR THEIR OWN AND SAYS. WOMEN IN VEHICLE RIGHT IS NOW RESULTING IN THE MARKET DURING. DOING IT HEALTHCARE UNITED TOWN THAT THE MANUFACTURERS ARE STEPPING UP AND THEY'RE PRODUCING PRODUCTS- AS YOUR HOPES OF MENTIONED YOU KNOW HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEVEN- AT NEW VEHICLES- THAT. THAT MEET THE NEEDS OF THE VARIETY OF PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA WE ARE OLD ENOUGH TO. HERE'S DOZENS AND DOZENS OF FAKE OF COMMERCIALS BY CAR DEALERS TELLING US THIS IS THE GREATEST THING AND I'M GONNA BE THE SEXIEST GUY IN THE WORLD IF I GET THIS VEHICLE AND INTO THIS- WE'LL SEE HOW THAT GOES OFF CHAIR RANDOLPH. THIS COULD SERVE ON A FINE POINT. THE GOVERNOR'S DOESN'T PROPOSE ANY FUNDING FOR VEHICLE SUBSIDIES SUCH AS THE- CTRP. WE JUST HEARD TESTIMONY FROM THAT WE THINK THE SUBSIDIES IN OCTOBER YOU VERY NECESSARY BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. I'M SITTING HERE IN. A NICE APRIL AFTERNOON IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE Y. EIGHT ZERO FOUR- TO SEE THE R. P. IT SAID THAT TRY TO YOUR SHOP. SO WE DO HAVE AN EXISTING INCENTIVE PROGRAMS AS A STATE TACKED ABOUT WITH CLEAN CARS FOR ALL YOU KNOW REALLY WANTING TO LEAN INTO- INTO EQUITY AND MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE DEPLOYING VEHICLES- FOR EVERYONE- AND- ALSO DRIVING THE SECONDARY MARKET WHICH HELPS- DR THE- AND THE NEW VEHICLE MARKET AS WELL. SO IT. IS NOT OUR ONLY OUR ONLY PROGRAM AND WE DO HAVE EXISTING PROGRAMS TO CONTINUE TO INCENTIVIZE RIGHT TO BE- AND HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES BUT WE YOU YOU KNOW THAT THERE ARE THREE CARE DISTRICTS ARE DOING NINE CARS FOR ALL IT'S A MODEST PROGRAM AND IT'S A YOU KNOW WHEN YOU GET A GREAT SUBSIDY IF YOU'RE LOW INCOME BUT THERE ARE. YOU KNOW THIRTY MILLION pVEHICLES WHAT WHAT ARE WE TARGETING FOR THE AVERAGE CALIFORNIAN TOOK THE BICYCLE THE ONCE THE BY ELECTRICAL RIGHT NOW THIS ADMINISTRATION SAYING THERE'S NOTHING FOR YOU. THERE'S NOTHING I MEAN IF YOU'RE LOW INCOME AND YOU LIVE IN THE RIGHT ZIP CODE YOU CAN GET A GOOD DEAL ON A FOUR YEAR OLD- LEAF GREAT BUT IF YOU'RE JUST AN AVERAGE CONSUMER COMING OUT OF THIS PANDEMIC. THERE'S NO INCENTIVE FOR YOU OTHER THAN IT'S THE RIGHT THING AND WE THINK THAT IT'S A WE'RE GOING TO BUILD THESE CHARGING STATIONS ONCE FROM THE TIME YOU. IT SEEMS THAT YOU'RE JUST LETTING THIS VERY POPULAR PROGRAM AND YOU KNOW THAT THIS TOPIC HAS BEEN OVER SUBSCRIBED YOU CAN RUN OUT OF MONEY IN THREE WEEKS AND YET THERE'S BEEN YOU KNOW THAT YOU NEED TO DO SOME SUBSIDY YOUTH THAT TESTIMONY TODAY'S BENDER HAS TO BE SOME SUBSIDY. AND YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT THERE'S OTHER PROGRAMS I KNOW THERE'S OTHER PROGRAMS I'M TALKING ABOUT C. V. R. P. WHICH IS POPULAR YOU'RE SAYING TO THE MIDDLE CLASS TO CALIFORNIA THERE'S NOTHING FOR YOU. YOU MAKE IT A. HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS JUST NO CAR FOR YOU. WELL AT I ALSO NOTED THERE IS THE- CLEAN SHE REPORT PROGRAM- WHICH DOES APPLY. REGARDLESS OF INCOME AND SO ON ON THE HOOD INCENTIVE TO. PERSEVERE BECAUSE OUT THE DOOR I APOLOGIZE OVERLOOKED THAT YOU'RE YOU'RE- CORRECT ABOUT. THAT I'M JUST SAYING THE- THE TONE THAT'S COMING OUT OF THIS ADMINISTRATION IS THAT THERE'S NOTHING HERE. AND THERE'S SOME OF US TO SIT HERE FOR YEARS LOOKING AT THIS OVER SUBSCRIBED PROGRAM- SCRATCHING OUR HEADS TRYING TO UNDERSTAND. THAT YOU GUYS ARE ALL TALKING WITH EACH OTHER IT'S NICE TO HAVE THIS P. C. P. U. C. AND C. ENERGY DEPARTMENT ALL TALKING AND THIS IS THE PLAN THAT YOU GUYS COME UP. I'M VERY. INTERESTED TO SEE WHAT YOU GUYS COME UP IN MAY. COULD YOU IT'S POP. WITH MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE THESE REBATE PROGRAMS AND THEY'D LIKE TO SEE YOU GUYS COME UP WITH A PROGRAM THAT'S THAT PUTS IT MONEY ON THE HOOD. AND IT'S A FRONT LOADED AND WE'RE NOT BLEEDING SIX TO EIGHT MONTHS BECAUSE SOME OF US THINK THAT THAT MAY MAKE IT EVEN MORE POPULAR. IF I COULD OFFSET MY SALES TAX BUT- I'LL BE WAITING TO SEE WHAT COMES OUT A CARB. IN THIS AREA IN THE MARCH IN THE MAY REVISE. THANK YOU SENATOR MCCASKILL I THINK MANY OF. BUT I JUST WITH I JUST WANTED TO IF I COULD JUST. I NOT TO GET IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT THIS DISCUSSION TOO MUCH BUT THOSE CLEAN THE CLEAN FEELS REWARD PROGRAM THAT SURE ENOUGH MENTIONED AT WHICH IS ON THE WOULD PROGRAM. DOES OFFER INCENTIVES UP TO FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS DEPENDING ON THE SIZE OF THE BATTERY SO IT. IT IS A SUBSTANTIAL INCENTIVE PROGRAM. THANKS CLASS. THANK YOU VERY THANK YOU- COME AND I WE ALL HAVE THOSE. I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF UP. CBO PEAK FIELD WORDS CARS FOR ALL. BUT I UNDERSTAND WHAT THE SENATOR SAYING IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE THERE'S AN OVERALL STRATEGY FOR REALLY ENSURING THAT- EVERY CALIFORNIA. CAN GET TO AN EEVEE AND AT THE END AND THAT THE MARKETING ACTUALLY- IS TAILORED TO- PEOPLE. GETTING CARS- THAT ARE ELECTRIC SO I THINK YOU KNOW WE'VE GOT A LOT OF WORK TO DO I ALSO AM AM VERY CURIOUS AS TO WHAT MAY WILL BRING. AND WITH THAT I MET- SAID OVER TO SENATOR STERN WITH QUESTIONS WELL. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR M. AND THANK YOU- IT TO BOTH THE CHAIRS FOR. UP THIS. THE CRUCIAL TOP ANTI- GOT TO QUICK BUT HOPEFULLY- USEFUL QUESTIONS TO ASK. I WANNA BE MORE AMBITIOUS THAN WHAT. THE GOVERNOR HAS PUT OUT THERE AND WHAT YOU PUT OUT THERE IN YOUR BUDGET- AND I THINK THE PRESIDENT HAS SAID THAT OR HIGHER FOR ALL OF US- SO. YOU KNOW THAT THE ONE POINT FIVE IT WAS PROPOSED IN THE BUDGET- AND THE AND THE TRAJECTORY THAT YOU'RE ON FOR EITHER CHARGING STATIONS OR- ZAGS PURCHASED BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE EIGHT WE HEARD SOME OF THOSE NUMBERS ONE POINT FIVE MILLION- YOU KNOW SORT OF DIFFERENT TRAJECTORIES YOU'RE ON WITH. CURRENT ANTICIPATED FUNDING LEVELS- BUT YOU KNOW BY MY MASTER WITH A HUNDRED SEVENTY TWO BILLION. PROPOSED AMERICAN JOBS PLAN ON HUNDRED SEVENTY TWO BILLION EVEN IF THEY DIVIDED THAT LIKE BY FIFTY STATES. BUT WOULD STILL BE AT ABOUT FIVE BILLION- FOR THIS STATE. SO IF WE HAD THAT THAT FIVE BILLION DOLLAR NUMBER JUST PICKING THAT NUMBER ALSO BECAUSE ENERGY SEIZE MODELING THEY WERE JUST SAYING BETWEEN FOUR TO SIX BILLION IS REALLY WHAT WE NEED TO GET. ALL THE WAY THERE BY. TWENTY THIRTY- WE HAD FIVE BILLION ANNUAL OF FOR THIS THIS. NEXT FIVE YEAR PERIOD- HAVE YOU GUYS DONE THAT MODELING THOSE PROJECTIONS HOW FAR WOULD WE GET. THIS HAVE THAT DATA. YOUR WITH YOUR PERMISSION I'D LIKE TO HAS CAMERA SCHOOL TO RESPOND ON THE STRUCTURE SIDE OF FIRST. YEAH YEAH THANK YOU FOR THAT AND- IT'S A GREAT QUESTION AND I'LL JUST SAY WHAT A DIFFERENCE A YEAR MAKES YOU KNOW TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE FUNDING FROM THE STATE AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY- LET ME MAYBE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT WERE CUT DURING THE PAST. SO LAST YEAR WE DID A YEAR INVESTMENT ARE TRENT PER ABOUT THE PLAN AND THAT WE TO MAKE REALLY TO FIX. SO FOR THAT YEAR PLAN IN THE YEAR WILL HAPPY ON LIGHT DUTY. ALSO I MEAN TO HAVING TO THAT SECOND YEAR WE OF DID SOMEONE THE METAL A LOT HERE MUCH MORE HAVE DUTY AND MEDIUM DUTY LEFT IN MY TO THE- WITH THIS INFLUX OF MONEY WE DON'T HAVE TO MAKE THE TOP CHOICES. WE CAN WHAT LEAST BE DONE THE DUTY WE CAN DO ANYTHING ME AND HAVE TO DO. TO PUT MORE COLOR TO. WE REALLY TO DO IT BECAUSE AND CLOSER GAP WHICH TWENTY. WE CAN DO THAT THROUGH AN EXTENSION OF THE CALATHEA P. PROGRAM. WHICH USES REALLY GRANULAR DOT AT THE COUNTY LEVEL. TO TARGET WITH THE BIGGEST GOT. THE OTHER THING I WANT TO DO. IS CURRENTLY RUN FOR. PROBE SO WE NEED TO. IN THE- EXT. ON UNIT DWELLINGS. WE NEED A PROGRAM THAT FOCUSES. ON RURAL COMMUNITIES- WORSE DESIGNING PROGRAM NOW. WE WANT TO BE FOR THE- OF WHAT COULD COME. OR FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. WE WANT TO PUT IN PLACE THE VEHICLE. WE CAN REALLY QUICKLY I'M NOT. AT ALL HAVE EQUITY COMPONENT WELL. SIMILARLY WERE TIED TO ME DO YOU HAVE DECIDE. AGAIN YOU KNOW. WE HAVE TO MAKE UP IT DIDN'T OF MONEY FROM DEAD BUT IF WE DO HAVE YOU OPPORTUNITY THAT ALLOWS IT TO DO MORE AT THE SCALE WE NEED THEIR- ON THE COMMUNITY HOW DID YOU DECIDE. WE WANT TO MORE GREAT TRUCK. EXTREMELY POLLUTING TRUCKS THAT ROCKET ONE NATION AND LOW ENERGY. WE WANT YOU MORE TRANSIT BUSES. COLLECT THEM FOR TRUCKS. AND ALSO WE HAVE AN ON MEDIAN HEAVY DUTY BLOCK. FOR THE BY THE COMMISSION IN MARCH WHAT PART OF CALIFORNIA NOT WANT. TO DEPLOY ACROSS ALL THE NEEDED DO YOU HAVE A DEFECT. REALLY WHAT THIS LITTLE US TO DO IT TO MAKE. TARA NOT. BUT I BROUGHT ABOUT THE ENTIRE RIGHT. AND MY ONE FALL UP QUESTION IS NO TO DO DO THE BUDGET SET SHARES- AND YOUR- YES THIS AGO MISTER A- IF THEY WAS MORE. IS THERE OPEN. STATE THEATER BORDER WRIT LARGE WITHIN THE ADMINISTRATION TO EXPANDING AND LOOKING AT CGRP ENHANCEMENTS OR OTHER- INSTEAD IS THAT MIGHT MOVE US YOU KNOW INTO A PLACE WHERE EVERY MIDDLE CLASS CALIFORNIAN YOU CAN START TO ACCESS SOMEBODY'S PROGRAMS WHERE YOU KNOW SOME OF THESE GROSS PUBLIC SCHOOLS AN BE TURNED IN FOR THE PLUS UP TO THE CLEAN CARS FOR ALL THEIR OPENNESS TO. DO EXPANSION. SENATOR I PROMISE YOU IF YOU GIVE ME FIVE BILLION DOLLARS- I CAN I CAN COME UP WITH SOME HEAVY DUTY. OPTIONS I CAN COME UP WITH- AS YOU KNOW LATE DUTY VEHICLE OPTIONS- SCHOOL BUS OPTIONS- YOU KNOW MORE AGRICULTURAL EQUIPMENT OPTIONS I CAN COME UP WITH OPTIONS. RIGHT I WOULD JUST SAY. I DON'T MEAN IT JUST AS A FLIP SORT OF REFERENCE TO A BIG NUMBER IT. IT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S HAPPENING RIGHT AND SO. TO GET PREPARED FOR IT AND TO BE ABLE TO ARTICULATE WHAT THOSE BENEFITS COULD LOOK LIKE THAT EVERY SCHOOL KID IN CALIFORNIA CAN GO TO SCHOOL IN A BUS THAT WILL MAKE THEM SICK WITH EVERY MIDDLE CLASS CALIFORNIA HAS A CHANCE TO GET INTO AN ELECTRIC VEHICLE- DOES SEEM. LIKE IT'S- ASPIRIN SO THE MORE YOU ALL CAN EVEN ARTICULATE THAT ASPIRATIONAL STUFF IF WE HAD MORE YOU'D GET THIS IF WE HAD MORE YOU'D GET THAT. THAT THAT WOULD HELP US IN THE LEGISLATURE ALSO KNOW HOW BIG THIS IS AND BY THE WAY IT'S NOT IT'S NOT ME. THE PRESIDENT SO HE HE'S GONNA BE THE ONE HOPEFULLY TO DELIVER HERE BUT WE'LL JUST TAKE TAKE ALL THE CREDIT- ANYWAY THANK YOU FOR DREAMING BIG I THINK IT'S NOT THE TIME FOR. INCREMENTALISM HERE I THINK THAT THERE'S APPROPRIATE SKEPTICISM AND SCRUTINY COMING FROM HIS OVERSIGHT HEARING INTO WHAT HAVING PUSH YOU GUYS TO DO MORE BUT I THINK THAT'S TO ME WHAT I TAKE AWAY IS LIKE. NEED TO DO MORE AND A LOT MORE AND SO WE HOPE. WE HAVE TO. SEND YOU GUYS PUSH. THANKS A LOT I'M HERE. THANK YOU SENATOR STERN- HEAR YOU LOUD AND CLEAR ON THAT THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THOSE ITEMS UP AND- SO NEXT WE HAVE A SENATOR DOLLY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. SO I JUST WANTED TO GET A RECAP ON WHAT I. HEARD AB CAN CREDIT SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE ONE AND A HALF MILLION. JOBS BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE THAT'S THE FIRST GOAL AND THEN BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE. NO MORE CELLS OF JOBS OBVIOUSLY IN IN CALIFORNIA WE'RE GONNA HAVE MANUFACTURES MAKING THOSE STEPS. SO IS THAT IS THAT WHAT I HEARD IN THE PLANNED BETWEEN NOW AND THEN IS THE RESOURCES WE HAVE AVAILABLE TO US. TO GET US TO TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. AND I ALSO IS A FOLLOW UP ON THAT AS WELL. THERE WAS A COMMENT ABOUT YOU KNOW PRIVATE CAPITAL OR OR BRING IN THAT. THE PRIVATE INVESTMENT IN AND THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AT TWENTY TWENTY FIVE IS THAT THE POLICE AND I KNOW THAT THAT. THAT MANUFACTURERS ARE. PUTTING THEIR CAPITAL UP TO. MEET DEMAND FOR THE MARKET AS WELL. YEAH MAYBE US SENATE PRIVATE CAPITAL PART I MEAN IT'S ALREADY HAPPENING IF YOU LOOK. AND YOU KNOW THAT. CAN ENTER COMMISSIONER BILL GINGER HOTEL CAN TALK ABOUT IT BUT YOU KNOW LIKE THAT MATCH THEIR- THEM OUT OF PRIVATE PUBLIC CAPITAL AS TO PUT IN THAT IT NAME OUTOF PRIVATE CAPITAL THAT THAT'S ATTRACTING IS INCREASING. BUT EVEN IF YOU JUST TAKE A STEP BACK AND LOOK AT WHERE WE ARE WITH CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE. THE MAJORITY OF INVESTMENT TO DATE HAS BEEN THE PRIVATE SECTOR IN IN PUBLIC CHARGING FOR EXAMPLE AND THEN IF YOU LATER ON LIKE WORKPLACE CHARGING THAT'S EVEN MORE. THAT WAY AND SO IT. IT'S REALLY ABOUT CREATING MARKETPLACE CERTAINTY THAT THEY KNOW THIS MARKET IS COMING IN AND IF YOU LOOK IN THE FUTURE YOU KNOW THAT TWENTY TWENTY. FIVE IS KIND OF A BAD. A GOOD PIVOT POINT TO THINK ABOUT THE GOING BACK TO SIMON MOVIES- PRESENTATION YOUR- TOTAL COST OF OWNERSHIP. IT MAY DECADE IS WHERE IT STARTS TO LOOK REALLY ATTRACTIVE FOR- YOU KNOW THE NUMBER OF CLASSES OF VEHICLES. THAT'S ALSO THE YOU KNOW IS A GREAT REPORT THE ENERGY COMMISSION COMMENCE WITH YOU SEE ABOUT I'D HIDE YOUR GENERATED WITH RENEWABLE HYDROGEN YOU CAN SEE THE COST COMPETITIVENESS WITH DIESEL AND GASOLINE IN THAT MID DECADE YOU KNOW. AND THAT'S OF COURSE ASSUMING. A NUMBER OF SUPPORT OF POLICIES BUT IT'S- I. THAT WILL WORK ON BUT IT. SO THERE'S- YES IT'S TWENTY ONE POINT FIVE. RAMPING UP VERY QUICKLY. DO YOU KNOW HOW TO PERCENT- BY. TWENTY THIRTY FIVE. MY OBSERVATION IS THAT- THE LAST COUPLE BUT LOWER THE LAST MONTH WE'VE- WE'VE HAD THE- HI SPEED. AND IT ALREADY WE DID IT THERE WAS AUDIT BASICALLY- AND THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO BE PRIVATE INVESTMENT AND PARTNERSHIPS COME ON THAT AND THEY HAVE REALLY DEVELOPED- WE HAD AN AUDIT ALSO OF THE CAREER RESOURCES BOARD WHICH I THINK FROM. BROUGHT A LOT OF- POINTS ON REALLY THE LOW INCOME PEOPLE WITH A RISK THERE'S A HUGE DISPARITY ON WHO'S GETTING THAT THE- THE RESOURCES- WE KNOW THAT I THINK IT WAS THE SENATE MEMBERS SALAS THAT DID ACTUALLY READ THE NUMBERS WERE HIS COMMUNITY WAS VERY LOW. THIS IN THE- BALLY IN THE COASTAL FOLKS WHO WERE WELL MORE WEALTHY- WE'RE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THAT SO I'M I'M REALLY SKEPTICAL AND ON AND I WAS HOPING WE WOULD GET A LITTLE BIT MORE ON THE- TRANSITION HOW IT REALLY GETS AT THIS IS THAT. I THINK IT AND YOU'RE ASKING THE LEGISLATURE TO STEP UP AND ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT EXECUTIVE ORDER ARE PUTTING PLANS TO GET THERE. AND I'M HAVING A TOUGH TIME FIGURE OUT HOW WE'RE GONNA GET TO EVEN TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. WHAT THE RESOURCES THANK GOD WE HAVE YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF MONEY IN THE GENERAL FUND RIGHT NOW. GET-AVAILABLE BUT- I'M ASSUMING THAT THIS ECNOMY IS NOT GOING TO STAY THIS STRONG JUST COMING OUT A- LITTLE BIT. HERE SHORTLY WE MAY SEE A WHOLE DIFFERENT SCENARIO. TWENTY TWENTY FIVE IT'S GONNA BE TOUGH. AND THEN FROM THERE ON IT'S GONNA BE REALLY TOUGH IN IT I DON'T KNOW VERY MANY MEMBERS THAT WILL. BE SOME WILL BE AROUND- AFTER TWENTY TWENTY FIVE BUT- ASSISTANCE THIS CALL ORDER I WAS HOPING TO GET A LITTLE MORE INFORMATION ON. REALLY HOW THAT LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOING TO WORK. WELL I CAN. I CAN ADD BRIEFLY THAT- YOU KNOW. AS AS WE HAVE DONE FOR SEVERAL YEARS THE AND YOU KNOW WE REALLY RELY ON A- A COMBINATION OF REGULATORY ACTIONS AND INCENTIVES- AND- AND INFRASTRUCTURE AS SENATE THE CDC FOLKS CAN TALK ABOUT- AND SO YOU KNOW WE WILL. CONTINUE AND TO DO THAT CONTINUE TO COORDINATE CLOSELY WITH OUR SISTER AGENCIES TO THEEXTENT- THAT- ADDITIONAL- FUNDING COMES FROM THE YOU KNOW THE- FIGHTING IN MINISTRATION OR OR AND- FEDERAL SOURCES YOU KNOW WE CAN. WE HAVE A LOT OF STRATEGIES THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO DEPLOY- YOU KNOW AS WE WERE TALKING ABOUT EARLIER ARE RURAL SCHOOL THAT- PROGRAM- COULD PUT. A YOU KNOW A THOUSAND BUSES- ON THE STREET- IN RURAL AREAS IN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES- AND AT YOU KNOW SO THERE'S A LOT OF LEVERAGE THAT THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO THE CLAY- AS WE CONTINUE TO COORDINATE VERY VERY CLOSELY WITH OUR SISTER AGENCIES. I COULD ADD CENTER DOLLARS DEBT. THAT THE INVESTMENTS ARE NOT GOING TO BE FOREVER JUST AS THE- INVESTMENTS IN FOR A CAR FOR PURCHASE OF VEHICLES WILL BE WILL BE ABLE TO TAPER OFF AS THE PRICE OF ELECTRIC VEHICLES COMES DOWN AND BECOMES THE SAME AS A TRADITIONAL CARD IS OF COURSE ALREADY CHEAPER TO OPERATE ELECTRIC VEHICLE YOU SAVE ON MAINTENANCE AND OTHER COSTS. THE SAME IS TRUE IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE SPACE RIGHT NOW WE'RE SUBSIDIZING AS A STATE IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT INFRASTRUCTURE IN MULTI FAMILY UNITS HARD TO ACCESS MARKET SEGMENTS. BECAUSE THE PRIVATE SECTOR DOESN'T SEE ENOUGH PEOPLE DRIVING ELECTRIC VEHICLES TO MAKE THOSE CHARGING STATIONS PROFITABLE BUT ONCE MORE PEOPLE DRIVE THE CARS. WE WILL BE ABLE TO STEP BACK AND PRIVATE COMPANIES WERE ALREADY ANXIOUS TO COME INTO THE INFRASTRUCTURE REMARKABLE STEP IN AND INCREASINGLY THEY'LL B ABLE TO MAKE A PROFIT GO BE A BUSINESS CASE FOR THOSE CHARGES. AS MORE MORE PEOPLE ADOPT VEHICLES SO YOU'VE HEARD THE CHICKEN AND THE EGG THING WITH ELECTRIC VEHICLES MANY TIMES BUT THAT'S HOW WE'RE ENVISIONING THINGS WE HAVE TO GET OVER TO. THE GAP OVER THE NEXT FIVE TEN OR MORE YEARS BUT THEN. THE MARKET WILL BE SELF SUSTAINING. LAB IS BEEN THAT. I JUST GOT LOOKED TRYING MEAN THAT I THINK THERE OVERLY PRICED RIGHT NOW I THINK THERE RECENTLY PRICE ACTUALLY IF YOU START LOOKING AT A COMPARABLE CARS ON THERE NOT OVER PRICES STEP INSTRUCTION THAT'S A BARRIER AT LEAST FOR ME- AND THE RANGE THAT THAT I WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO YOU KNOW COMMUTE. BUT BUT BUT WE'VE I'M NOT TALK TO THE DEALERS OUT THERE WHO'VE BEEN FORCED ME WE PUT LEGISLATION THROUGH THIS FORCE THEM TO HAVE SO MANY CARS THAT THEY HAVE TO GET THE DEBT TO MOVE AND THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO MOVE AND SO THE DEMAND IDE EVEN WITH INCENTIVES AND I AGREE WITH THE- THE CENTER. OF MY CASKET IT. WILL IF WE'RE NOT GONNA INSTEAD OF IT WOULD. FIGURE WAY OUT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE CAN GET A- ON- I THINK IT'S GONNA BE DIFFICULT AND WE HAVE TO. SOMEHOW YOU KNOW IT'S JUST. IT'S MIND BLOWING WHEN I SEE. TWENTY NINE AGENCIES THAT THE FIRST CHART WITH ALL THOSE ACRONYMS ON THEIR AND- LOGOS. COORDINATING THIS WHOLE PROCESS IS. TO ME IS. YOU KNOW I'M I'M NOT CONFIDENT THAT. THOSE AGENCY ALL THOSE AGENCIES TOGETHER- CAN GET THIS JOB DONE AND IF WE DUMPED. BILLIONS IN THESE PROCESSES AS WELL SO FAR SO RIGHT. BUT I ACTUALLY WANT TO BUY WHEN I LOOKED UP I WILL NOT SAY I I'M I'M I DRIVE A- FORD. AND I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE AN ELECTRIC WHEN I JUST THAT YOU'D BE COOL IF I COULD GET FIVE HUNDRED MILES OUT OF IT I DRIVING ONE EVEN IF IT WAS COST. SO BUT I GOTTA BE ABLE TO GET FROM POINT A TO POINT B. AND SO. AND THAT'S TWO OR THREE YEARS OUT THAT'S CLOSE TO OUR TWENTY TWENTY FIVE MARK BEFORE. THOSE VEHICLES ARE GONNA BE AVAILABLE. THANK YOU SENATOR DAHLE AND I- WE'RE ALL IN AGREEMENT HERE YOU KNOW WE I THINK THE END OF THE END GOAL HERE IS THIS OVER ARCHING STRATEGY THAT WE'RE- REALLY TRYING TO FIGURE OUT AND I DO HAVE ONE QUESTION ABOUT THAT- BUT THE- LEGISLATURE DOES HAVE A LOT OF. DECISIONS TO MAKE IN FRONT OF IT IN TERMS OF A BUDGET APPROPRIATIONS AND SO WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT WERE. TYING THOSE TO THE CORRECT STRATEGIES HERE- AND BEFORE I ASK MY QUESTION ACTUAL GO TO SENATOR ARCHULETA. YES THANK YOU VENTURE JUST WANT TO CLARIFY. SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT- I STILL HAVE- FROM THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO TESTIFIED TODAY. BUT THAT JUST HYPOTHETICAL THERE'S A PARK. WITHIN TWO MILES OF ART CAPITAL HERE. IN THE CITY IS AGREED TO PUT IN FOR. A CHARGING STATIONS. SO LET'S LOOK AT THE PARTNERSHIP IN THE COSTS WHAT WOULD THAT LOOK LIKE. HI HEADED AGAIN DO YOU WANT TO SPEAK TO HOW WE'RE- INCENTIVIZING- THE CITY INVESTMENTS. CAN YOU SPEAK UP PLEASE. YES COMMISSIONER YEAH I'LL BE HAPPY TO- OKAY YES WE CAN HEAR YOU NOW. OKAY GREAT YEAH SO THE WAY WE DO THAT IS WE RUN FOR THE TAKING BEEN PARTNER WITH- DIFFERENT PRIVATE ENTITIES BUSINESSES AND MUNICIPALITIES AS WELL SO IF YOU'RE EXAMPLE STATE PARK ONE TO DO IT THEY CAN APPLY FOR ONE REPLICATION OR IF THERE WAS ENOUGH OF A PUBLIC POLL FOR THAT WE WOULD NINE APPLICATION AROUND THAT. MAKE IT ELIGIBLE FOR FOLKS AND WE OUGHT TO DO THAT IS IF WE USE THE BLOCK GRANT THERE'S ONE DESIGN BOOKS SOMETHING LIKE THIS WE WOULD BE ONE WHERE WE SENT A VERY CLEAR SCORING CRITERIA A LOT OF THAT OFF NOT WITH NOT SHARING. AND THE PEOPLE WOULD THEN APPLY TO IT AND WE SCORED DOWN. NOT LIVE AND FUND PROJECTS. FOR SOMETHING LIKE YOU DESCRIBE. I COULD SEE IF NAY. WHERE WE- YOU KNOW WE WANT ME 2% SHARING PARTNER. AND THEY WILL COME US WE CORD. GET THE BACK BANG FOR THE UP DOLLAR. AND ALSO ENSURE WE MAY SMART- AND PARKED IN THE WHERE. GO IN THE CAR. IT SO CARACAL THE I. P. PROGRAM WE YOU FORTY HUNDRED DOLLAR PER LEVEL TWO STATION AND NOT FROM THE PUBLIC DOLLAR WE LEVERAGE AN ADDITIONAL ABOUT EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR FOR THE DC FAST CHARGERS SO FOR EXAMPLE IN ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING ABOUT CHARTER ABOUT SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS- PUBLIC SECTOR. LEVERAGING ABOUT ONE THIRD FROM THE OTHER. THANK YOU VENTURE THANK YOU SENATOR ARCHULETA OKAY MY FINAL QUESTION AND THEN WE HAVE OUR LAST AND FINAL A PANEL HERE- JUST SORT OF IN THE SAME SENSE OF COORDINATION I THINK WE'VE HEARD THAT A COUPLE TIMES FROM SOME OF OUR- SOME OF SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES HERE. BUT IT IS- DESCRIBED IN OUR BACKGROUND PAPER AS WELL- FOR INSTANCE ONE EXAMPLE THAT C. E. C. AND THE P. YOU SEE MANAGING- AND FUNDING THE ARE CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE THE CHARGING STATIOS VERY DIFFERENTLY. HOW IS THAT RECONCILED AND WHO IS THE OVER ARCHING BODY TO BE ABLE TO COME TO A- AT IT A CERTAIN GOAL AS TO HOW WE WOULD GET TO OUR CHARGING STATION- GOALS AND INFRASTRUCTURE GOALS I THINK. AGAIN I'M STILL TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHERE WE'RE HEADED IN THAT DIRECTION BUT THIS IS ONE EXAMPLE OF MANY OTHER. PLACES WERE SEEING WHERE WE MAY BE. NEEDING MORE COORDINATION AND WE'RE JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHO'S- RESPONSIBILITY YOU GET A CHECK IN I CAN SPEAK TO THAT IN THE- TURKISH SOCCER CAN. CHINA'S SO- BASICALLY. IS ON POINT MOST VEHICLES THE ENERGY COMMISSION. WAS DIRECTED BY THE STATE LEGISLATURE AB TWENTY ONE TWENTY SEVEN TO DO THE STATEWIDE ASSESSMENT FOR CHARGING NEEDS AND THEN WE FIND. CHARGERS THROUGH THE DEEPLY TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM AND THE P. YOU SEE OVERSEAS. THE NOT UTILITIES BUT THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITY INVESTMENTS IN CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE- AND SO WE WORK VERY CLOSELY- TOGETHER WITH THEM THE COMMISSION WRECK SHOP IN A MATURE YOU WOULD ADD MORE THERE WELL THAT'S RIGHT WE FOLLOW THE CDC'S LEAD IN TERMS OF THE OVER THE NEED FOR INFRASTRUCTURE SO WE T&lt;c.cyan&gt;.&lt;/c&gt; BOTH THE SEGMENTS OF THE NUMBER OF CHARGERS TO THEIR OVERALL ASSESSMENT AND I THINK AT THE HIGHER LEVEL GOBIZ KEEPS US ALL ON TRACK TO MAKING SURE THAT COLLECTIVELY WE ARE MEETING THE ADMINISTRATION CALLS. YEAH I THINK THAT'S RIGHT I THINK. AND SO EACH STATE AGENCY HAS IF IT IS NOT DUPLICATIVE IT'S VERY COMPLEMENTARY THEY WORK HAND IN GLOVE TOGETHER ARE ROLLING GO IS MAKE SURE THAT CONTINUES TO HAPPEN. WE DON'T HAVE TO DO MUCH THEN THAT FRONT REALLY EVER BECAUSE EVERYBODY'S WORKING SO CLOSELY TOGETHER BUT IT'S YOU KNOW IF THERE EVER IS AND THAT DISPUTED WE NOTICED SOMETHING IS GOOD HEY THIS IS ACTUALLY DUPLICATIVE THAT'S WHEN WE GO WE TALK WE SORT THAT OUT MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE- LEVERAGING OUR RESOURCES MOST. EFFICIENTLY AS POSSIBLE BUT THAT THEREABSOLUTELY COMPLEMENTARY ANY THEY WORK DECISION THAT COMES OUT OF PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION HAS TAKEN THE ENERGY COMMISSION ANALYSIS INTO ACCOUNT. THAT THE C. SAME THING WITH THE UTILITY INVESTMENTS TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE GIVEN THE MARKETS THAT WE NEED TO. THE MOST. AND IF I COULD- YOU KNOW AS AN EXAMPLE OF- COORDINATION- RECENTLY WE DID CAN. BE COMPETITIVE SOLICITATIONS WHERE HE HE AND CARP APPLICATION PROCESS EASIER STREAMLINED. AND THAT RESULTED IN FIFTY AND HEARING MISSION TRADES TRACKS AND INFRASTRUCTURE- WITH SO THE CDC FUNDED THE INFRASTRUCTURE PART WE FUNDED THE VEHICLE CARE AND WE DID IT IN A REALLY COORDINATED FASHION. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT- WILL CONTINUE TO ADD TO ASK THESE QUESTIONS AND ENSURE ALL COORDINATING EFFECTIVELY BUT I APPRECIATE THAT THE ANSWER IS NONETHELESS. OKAY SO WE'RE GONNA I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER MEMBER QUESTIONS SO WE WILL GO AHEAD AND- START OFF WITH OUR THIRD PANEL ON FINAL PANEL WILL START WITH PROFESSOR STEVE RITCHIE HE'S THE DIRECTOR OF UC INSTITUTE OF TRANSPORTATION STUDIES AND PROFESSOR OF CIVIL AND- AND FROM. ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEER. AT UC IRVINE- WELCOME PROFESSOR RICHIE AND I WANT TO THANK OUR LAST PANEL FOR THEIR COMMENTS AS WELL. GO RIGHT AHEAD. GREAT THANK YOU FOR THAT AND GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRS AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEES I'VE BEEN ASKED TO PROVIDE COMMENTS. TO THIS SPEAK WITH YOU THIS AFTERNOON. GREAT WE CAN HEAR YOU GO RIGHT AHEAD. ON THE LIGHT DUTY VEHICLE SECTOR THE HEAVY DUTY SECTOR REALLY IS NOT AS WELL UNDERSTOOD FROM RESEARCHING PUBLICLY. IT FEATURES GREATER COMPLEXITY WELL CITY OF DATA LACK OF TOOLS FOR POLICY ANALYSIS INCLUDING. PROFESSOR RICHIE I THINK YOU MIGHT BE GOING IN AND OUT A BIT. ARE YOU STILL ABLE TO SEE MY SLIDES AND GETTING SOON MESSAGES THAT IT'S QUICK. YES YOUR PRESENTATION IS NO LONGER UP- WE CAN SEE YOU BUT WE CAN HEAR YOU NOW PERFECTLY SO IF YOU'D LIKE TO GO AHEAD AND PROCEED- COLLEGE EYES FOR THAT I'M NOT SURE WHAT HAPPENED WOULD SOON BUT- SO HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES ARE RELATIVELY SMALL IN NUMBER BUT THERE. THE BIG AN IMPACT IN CALIFORNIA WE'VE GOT ABOUT TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND CLASS EIGHT. TRUCKS SEES A LARGE THREE AXLE TRACTOR IS ALMOST HOLDEN USED DIESEL. AND I THINK YOU'RE WELL AWARE OF THE DISPROPORTIONATE AIR QUALITY IMPACTS OF THESE VEHICLES- THERE ARE A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT HEAVY DUTY DIESEL ATTRIBUTES TO CONSIDER WHEN DEVELOPING POLICY TO TRANSITION SERVICE THIS HELPS US TO FIND THE VEHICLE TYPES AND APPLICATIONS THAT ARE TO BE SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSED. THE FEASIBILITY OBSERVE TECHNOLOGIES AND TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE BEFORE AND AFTER- IMPLICATIONS OF POLICY IMPACTS AND SO. THEIR NUMBER OF ATTRIBUTES IS INCLUDE THE CLASS OF THE VEHICLE THAT'S RELATIVELY STRAIGHTFORWARD THE FEDERAL HIGHWAY ADMINISTRATION IS A WEIGHT BASED CLASS SYSTEM WITH DIFFERENT AGENCIES INCLUDE DIFFERENT CLASSES IN THE DEFINITIONS OF. WHAT AN HDD IS. THERE A DIFFERENT VOCATIONS THINGS LIKE DRY AGES WITH WITH HEARD REFUSE SHORT LONG WALL AND OFTEN INVOLVES VEHICLES WITH DIFFERENT CHARACTERISTICS. THE COMMODITIES OF THESE VEHICLES CAREY CAN BE IMPORTANT TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THEIR AGE DISTRIBUTION. IS IMPORTANT OLDER VEHICLES TEND TO BE HIGHER EMITTING- RECENT WORK SHOWS. THAT MANY CONSTRUCTION. VEHICLES ARE ALL THAN OF WE- AND THE CONCERT DIRECT IN THE AREAS. THE FLEET SIZE IS IMPORTANT TOO BECAUSE THE OWNER OPERATORS AND SMALL FLEETS MIGHT FOCUS WE THINK ON UP FRONT PURCHASE PRICES. OF ZIV TO A GREATER DEGREE THAN SAY THE TOTAL COST OF OWNERSHIP OF THE LIFE THE EAGLES SLUDGE FLEETS MIGHT CALCULATE AND THE SMALLER FLEETS MAY FEEL PRICED OUT OF THE MARKET. ACTIVITY PATTERNS OF THE VEHICLES ARE ALSO PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT FOR EXAMPLE WHETHER THEY RETURNED. TO BASE AT NIGHT OR EVEN DURING THE DAY. IT WOULD CASE IT FOR. ON SITE OR HOME BASE BUSINESS ON ROAD CHARGING AND REFUELLING. AND THE CAR DOORS IN THE COMMUNITIES IN SWEET KIND OF HEARD THESE VEHICLES TRAVELS THROUGH AND THE RESULTING AIR QUALITY AND HEALTH IMPACTS CAN HAVE IMPORTANT ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE AND- PUBLICATIONS. SO CALIFORNIA HAS ABOUT SEVENTY THOUSAND MILES- INDEPENDENT OWNER OPERATORS THEY OPERATE PRIMARILY CLASS AGE WELL IT'S TRUCKS THEY HAVE A MEDIAN NET INCOME OF FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. CALIFORNIA PORTS ARE ALSO KNOWN TO RELY HEAVILY ON SMALL FLEET AN OWNER OPERATOR- VEHICLES SO HEAVY DUTY SAID POLICIES REALLY NEED TO RECOGNIZE THE POTENTIAL ECONOMIC IMPACT. ON SMALL FLEET'S WHICH ARE AN IMPORTANT WORKFORCE STATEMENT TO AVOID POTENTIALLY PRICING THEM OUT OF THE SECTOR OR CREATING NEW BARRIERS TO ENTRY WHEN THERE'S ALREADY A SHORTAGE OF EVERY DUTY AND DRAPES DRIVERS. WELL ACTUALLY THE IDEAS OF MINE- WE CONDUCTED RECENTLY A SMALL WITH VERY DETAILED SURVEY OF TWENTY FLEETS FROM SMALL TO LARGE IN SIZE ACROSS VARIOUS LOCATIONS. AND IDENTIFIED NUMEROUS FACTORS INFLUENCING THE ADOPTION OF. FUEL HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES INCLUDING BATTERY ELECTRIC AND FUEL CELL. THE PURPOSE OF THE SURVEY WAS TO ACT AS A PILOT TO DEVELOP A THEORY OF FLEET FUEL ADOPTION BEHAVIOR AS A PRECURSOR TO A MUCH LARGER SURVEY. WE DOING THIS SUMMER IN ORDER TO FORECASTING MODEL IF YOU DESERVE. ADOPTION THE FACT IS THAT EMERGED NOT IN ORDER OF IMPORTANCE INCLUDED TECHNOLOGY CHARACTERISTICS SUCH AS THE AVAILABILITY AND SUITABILITY OF. AS IN EAGLE IS THE REASON ONE OF THE AVAILABLE FOR THE FUNCTION OF THE SENATE NEEDS. OF THE TOTAL COST OF OWNERSHIP WHICH IS PURCHASE PRICE OPERATING MAINTENANCE COSTS RESELL VALUE. THE FUEL CRISIS AND INFRASTRUCTURE. THERE WERE SEVERAL ORGANIZATIONAL CHARACTERISTICS THAT EMERGE ONE WAS ENVIRONMENTAL CONSCIOUSNESS ONE MIGHT CALL IT. A NUMBER OF FANS WHO GENERALLY INTERESTED IN GREEN TECHNOLOGIES FOR BOTH SOCIETAL AS WELL AS BUSINESS REASONS. SOME FIRMS ALSO EXPRESSED A RELUCTANCE TO MOVE TO THE NEWER DESERVES HAVING ALREADY COMMITTED SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES. TWO ONE FUEL SUCH AS NATURAL GAS COMPRESSED NATURAL GAS WAS PARTICULAR CASE IN POINT IN THAT MIGHT DELAY THEIR CONVERSION TO OTHER. GOOGLE'S THIS WELL. SO LET ME JUST WRAP UP IN CONCLUSION I'D LIKE TO SUGGEST WE STILL HAVE MANY UNCERTAINTIES IN DATA GAPS THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED AND THESE INCLUDE- WITH A SPECIFIC SEGMENTS OF THE HDV SECTOR SHOULD BE PRIORITIZED FOR INCENTIVES WITH THE BATTERY ELECTRIC OR FUEL CELL WHICH ONES AND WE'VE HEARD ABOUT YOUR AGE IN PARTICULAR BEING A PRIORITY ONE. THE END WAS WHAT OBJECTIVES GREENHOUSE GASES REDUCTION- CRITERIA POLLUTANTS PUBLIC HEALTH STATEWIDE OR MORE LOCAL FOCUS SECTIONS AROUND THE PORTS IN PARTICULAR AND DISADVANTAGED AREAS CONSIDERING THE WORK FORCE IMPACTS AND THE EQUITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ISSUES. WHAT OF REGULATIONS AND INCENTIVES TO USE. WE ALSO NEED A BETTER UNDERSTANDING I BELIEVE IT REDUCES THE PURCHASE DECISION MAKING BY PLEADS AND HAVING TOOLS TO. BETTER PREDICT ZIV MARKET PENETRATION YVOLUTION THREE TWENTY FIFTY. HELLO WE'LL SMALL FLEETS AND OWNER OPERATORS BE IMPACT IMPACTED AND WILL THEY REACT DIFFERENTLY FROM LARGER FLEETS. WE KNOW THAT SAID TECHNOLOGY AND COST SKEPTICAL THRUSTER OF SLOWER THAN EXPECTED SO WE REALLY NEED REGULAR REASSESSMENT ALL SEASON PROGRESS TOWARD TARGETS. AND A FINAL POINT IS HOW WILL HEAVY DUTY FLEET ELECTRIFICATION AND CHARGING IMPACT- INCREASINGLY DECARBONISE ELECTRIC GRIDS IN CALIFORNIA THAT WILL THIS AFFECT THE TOTAL COOPERATION. CERTAIN THE TOTAL COST OF OPERATION OKAY WE DO DESERVES AND- IN WHAT FASHION BECAUSE THAT COULD BE QUITE SIGNIFICANT. IN TERMS OF PURCHASE DECISIONS. NONE- IN MY COMMENTS THERE THANKS I'M SORRY ABOUT THE ZOOM- THAT IS THE CLEANING UP. THANK YOU PROFESSOR RICHIE WE APPRECIATE THAT- NEXT WE HAVE MEREDITH ALEXANDER POLICY DIRECTOR FOR CAL START WELCOME IS ALEXANDER. NO YOU CAN'T GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS CAN YOU HEAR ME OK NOW. YES WE CAN. OKAY GREAT TRYING TO GET THE SENDS FLETCHER MODE. I'M JUST GIVE ME ONE SECOND WELL THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME HERE THIS AFTERNOON. AND I THINK HOPEFULLY I'M GOING TO COMPLEMENT A LOT OF THE THINGS YOU'VE HEARD TODAY AND TRY TO DROP AND CONNECTIONS. BETWEEN VARIOUS SPEAKERS AND TOPICS THAT THEY'VE COVERED- AND WE GET CAL START OUR AND NUMBER BASED FIVE A ONE TWO THREE. WE HAVE MEMBERS ALL ACROSS THE G. CLEAN TRANSPORTATION SPECTRUM FROM VEHICLE MANUFACTURERS TO PUBLICLY. TECHNOLOGY PROVIDERS. ETCETERA AND SO I CULTURE WE REALLY ADVOCATE FOR AS- PROFESSOR RICH YOU JUST ALLUDED AN ECOSYSTEM APPROACH TO POLICY. AND WE'VE HEARD TODAY ABOUT OUR EXTREMELY AMBITIOUS GOALS AND WHAT THE CARD IS DOING ON THE REGULATORY SIDE TO ADVANCE THEIR EMISSION VEHICLES- AND YOU KNOW WE ARE. LOOKING AT. CHANGE FOR THIS MARK AND I WANTED TO POINT OUT AS- MY PROFESSOR RITCHIE ALSO TO THIS IS A VERY COMPLEX SEGMENT- A LOT OF. THESE QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS TODAY HAVE DEALT WITH LIGHT DUTY VEHICLES. INTENDED FOR LIGHT DUTY VEHICLES AND CHARGERS- WHICH OF COURSE HELP START THINGS ARE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT- BUT WANTED TO TALK ABOUT THIS VERY DIVERSE SEGMENT AND SAY THAT. WE CERTAINLY DO NOT PREDICT THAT WE WILL NOT NEED AND SENATE HAVE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. FOR THE MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY SECTOR- WHAT CARVING HELP START HAVE LAID OUT HERE IS THIS THEORY OF CHANGE ABOUT WIENER. OF MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY AND OFF ROAD VEHICLES. AND THAT WE ARE TRANSITIONING IN DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF THE WAY IN. THE EARLY MOVERS TO THOSE THAT ARE GOING TO BE MORE COMPLICATED ON THE RIGHT END. OF THE SPECTRUM LIKE LONG HAUL TRUCKS. THAT WOULD THIS IS REALLY AND WE SEE THAT THERE WILL BE A NEED FOR ANY KIND OF FOR A LONG TIME- AND WE ARE GONNA NEED TO WALK AND CHEW GUM AT THE SAME TIME TO COMPLETELY TRANSFORM THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR I'M NOT GONNA SPEAK ABOUT EACH OF THESE. FOR THE SAKE OF TIME BUT THERE ARE SO MANY DIFFERENT ELEMENTS THAT THE STATE NEEDS TO FOCUS ON- I'M- YOU KNOW. EQUITY AND WHEN INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE RIGHT ROLE OF INCENTIVES- AND PROVIDING ALL CALIFORNIANS WITH ACCESS TO CLEAN TRANSPORTATION AND CLEARING. THE AIR IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. BUT I DO WANT TO FOCUS ON THE LAST ONE WHICH IS THAT WE DO IDENTIFY THAT THE INITIAL PURCHASE PRICE OF THE VEHICLE. AND THE INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS IT'S STILL THE NUMBER ONE BARRIER. HE THEN ADOPTING A CULTURE. AND THAT WE REALLY THINK THAT WE NEED THE STATE TO BACK UP YOUR. GOALS AND REGULATORY. THIS MS ALEXANDER. CAN YOU GO RIGHT AHEAD. WE CAN I THINK EVERYTHING IS FINE ON OUR END. SHE GOT ON OUR END. OKAY NOW IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE MUTED YES I'M BACK ON COMPUTER AUDIO I'M SO SORRY THAT WERE SILENT ON THE PHONE FOR HOURS AND IT DECIDED TO CUT OUT RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF MY PRESENTATION AND THAT WAS OUR DAY WE'RE SORRY ABOUT. THE RIGHT. HI ALWAYS FUN EXAM- SO I THINK WHAT I WAS SAYING IS THAT WE NEED THE STATE TO BACK UP OUR ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES WITH FUNDING. MOST NEEDED IS TO SEND A SIGNAL TO THE INDUSTRY THAT'S BRINGING THESE VEHICLES FOR MARKET. SHARE ON ON THE BEACH HEAD SIDE. THAT FUNDING BE OF THE AND THEREFORE DEMAND WILL BE THERE IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE REALLY DRIVEN THIS MARKET ESPECIALLY FOR MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES I THINK YOU'VE ALSO HEARD WE'VE DRIVEN THIS MARKET FOR LIGHT DUTY VEHICLES. AND IF MANUFACTURERS ARE GOING TO CONTINUE RAMPING UP THE MODELS THAT THEY MAKE AVAILABLE AND COUNTING ON INCREASED SALES VOLUME IN CALIFORNIA WE NEED PREDICTABILITY AND CONSISTENCY IN VEHICLE INCENTIVES. SO YOU KNOW WHERE WE WERE WITH EACH BANK IS WE HAVEN'T HAD. SINCE OCTOBER OF TWENTY NINETEEN SO YOU KNOW WE'VE SEEN DRAMATIC DECREASE IN- PURCHASES AND ORDERS IN CALIFORNIA AND AGAIN WE WANT MANUFACTURERS TO RAMP UP THEIR PRODUCTION THAT'S REALLY THAN SENDING WRONG MESSAGE. AND WE TRULY BELIEVE THAT IF WE CAN GET TO INCREASING VOLUMES COSTS WILL COME DOWN SALES WILL GO OUT AND OVER TIME WE CAN AS INSIDE FRANCISCO FROM. ONE SEGMENT MEDIUM AND HEAVY MARKET TO. SO THIS IS STAR MODEL AND IS FREE PANDEMIC I'M THEY WANTED TO AGAIN THAT IN TWENTY TO THE BUDGET FOR DUTY INCENTIVE WAS NO. AND THE PHONE RAN OUT. ALL TO NINETEEN. I'M AND SO. OF CHANGE IS WE SEE. VEHICLE OF. WHICH MEANS. DEMAND FOR. IS GOING TO RAMP UP. OVER THE- FIVE TO SIX YEARS. AND THEN THE OF BEING IN A THIS IS CAL STAR. NOT NOT THE CARD PROJECTION- THESE ARE OBVIOUS IDEAL. BY AS WE TO HIT TIPPING AND MARKETS TANK WE COULD DECREASE IN AND- FOR THOSE THE CLASS. IN THE PHASE THEM OUT. INSIDERS WILL THEN BE A- TO VEHICLE TYPE THAT AREN'T. TODAY SUCH AS LONG HAUL TRUCK- AND MARMI DUTY WORK TRUCKS LIKE FORD F. TWO FIFTY THREE FIFTY IS THE WORLD AREN'T. YET AVAILABLE. NUMBER EXACT. MANUFACTURERS AND SUPPLIERS IN THE STATE AND WE SEE A LOT OF SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZED BUSINESSES IN THIS SPACE I'M THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY UNIQUE COMPANIES. I THINK THIS IS A REALLY POSITIVE MESSAGE SB. OVERLOOKS CITED A GREAT JOB TALKING ABOUT ALL THE AMAZING BENEFITS WE WILL GET FROM THIS TRANSITION. AND WE THINK CONTINUED JOB GROWTH IN CALIFORNIA. WILL CERTAINLY BE ONE THING. SO REALLY QUICKLY I'M- NOT GONNA GO THERE ACTUALLY. REALLY QUICKLY TURNING TO INFRASTRUCTURE FOR A MOMENT. WE'VE TALKED A LOT ABOUT INFRASTRUCTURE TODAY- COMMITTEE ON ALASKA REALLY GREAT QUESTIONS I WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT THAT. THE MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY INFRASTRUCTURE SIDE IS REALLY BEHIND LIGHT DUTY. I'M CUSTOMERS THAT COSTS FOR ESPECIALLY CHARGING FOR HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES ARE REALLY SIGNIFICANT THEY CAN BE FIFTY TO A 100% THE VEHICLE COST. AND THE CDC IS COMMITTED OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS TO PUTTING A HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION INTO MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S FROM THE CUSTOMER SIDE PROGRAMS. AND IF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED TRAILER BILL IS APPROVED THEY'LL PUT IN ANOTHER FIVE HUNDRED MILLION. WE THINK THIS SENDS A REALLY STRONG SIGNAL TO THE INDUSTRY-THAT THE STATE WILL BACK THEM UP ESPECIALLY FOR EARLY ADOPTERS. AND WE ARE DEFINITELY VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THIS IDEA OF HAVING A LONG TERM. FUNDING SOURCE FOR INFRASTRUCTURE WERE ALSO VERY HAPPY THAT THE QC HAS AUTHORIZED THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES THE POINT I'M SIGNIFICANT INVESTOR. UTILITY FUNDS ONTO THE DISTRIBUTION GRID TO PROVIDE THE UPGRADES NEEDED FOR THESE VEHICLES. BUT I DO WANT TO SAY THAT WE THINK IT'S QUITE IMBALANCED HOW LONG TERM FUNDING PLAN OR AT LEAST A PROPOSAL THAT WE HOPE WILL BE ADOPTED FOR INFRASTRUCTURE FUNDING WITHOUT A CORRESPONDING LONG TERM PLAN OR EVEN JUST THREE YEAR PLAN FOR VEHICLE INCENTIVE FUNDING FOR THE SECTOR SO. I'LL START WOULD LOVE TO SEE THE LEGISLATURE ARM. TAKE ACTION THERE. YEAH THE LAST COUPLE I WAS TO TALK WORK FOR. AND WE ARE. SUPPORTIVE OF FINDING FINANCING SOLUTIONS FOR THE SWEETS ESPECIALLY SMALL AND PUBLICLY YOU'RE REALLY GONNA NEED. WRAPAROUND FUNDING EVEN IF THEY GET THAT EACH WITHOUT SURE THEY STILL NEED TO BORROW. A COUPLE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS TO BUY ZERO EMISSION HEAVY DUTY TRUCK. WE'D LOVE TO SEE PROGRAMS LIKE HOW CAP EXPANDS SO THAT THEY CAN SERVE ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE PURCHASERS. AND WORKING WITH NRDC WE WOULD LOVE TO SEE BUYERS BE ABLE TO LEVERAGE THEIR FUTURE SAVINGS AND REVENUE STREAMS FOR THOSE LINES. I'MAND THEN ON. I DID WANT TO SAY THAT. YOU KNOW WE THINK EVERY CALIFORNIAN DRIVING THEIR OWN ELECTRIC VEHICLE ISN'T REALLY SHOULDN'T REALLY BE THE GOAL- BUT EVERY CALIFORNIAN BREATHING CLEAN AIR. AND HAVING ACCESS TO CONVENIENCE IN ZERO EMISSION CHOICES FOR MOBILITY. AND WHETHER THAT'S A BUSCA BIKE WEARING E. V. IS A GREAT CALL. THERE'S NO ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH I AM AND CLEARING THE AIR IN OUR COMMUNITIES BY CONVERTING TRUCK AND BUS FLEETS. IS DEFINITELY BRINGING EQUITY. I'M NOT SURE RAN MENTIONED THIS WELL THE NEW CLEAN UP OFF PROGRAM WITHIN IT'S A GREAT EXAMPLE OF HOW THE STATE. CAN SUPPORT PRIORITY COMMUNITIES BECAUSE IT ELEVATES THE ROLE THAT THEY PLAY. AND ALLOWS THEM TO TAKE THE LEAD IN ADDRESSING THEIR PARTICULAR LOCAL TRANSPORTATION ISSUES. AND FINDING SOLUTIONS THAT WORK FOR THEM- SO THESE ARE ALL THE COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE APPLIED FOR FUNDING UNDER THIS PROGRAM THERE'S BEEN. REALLY HIGH DEMANDS WHICH WE THINK IS EXTREMELY POSITIVE- THE NEGATIVE SIDE OF THAT IS THAT ALSO. CMO I'M IN THE SUITE OF CARDS EQUITY PROGRAMS USUALLY GETS. A ONE YEAR APPROPRIATION. I THINK LAST YEAR ABOUT A ONE TIME APPROPRIATION FROM SAN. EARLIER YEAR FUNDS IN SEVERAL ALSO YOU'RE ONLY BEING FUNDED BY G. JURASSIC IS NOT NECESSARILY. UNSUSTAINABLE AND WE THINK THERE SHOULD BE OTHER SOURCES OF FUNDING PUT INTO REALLY CRITICAL CLEAN ABILITY PROGRAMS LIKE SAM ALL. BUT WE'RE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF. THIS YEAR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL FOR EQUITY AND WOULD ALSO LIKE TO SEE MORE FUNDING INTO EQUITY PROGRAMS THAT PROGRAMS LIKE THIS CAN EXPAND. I THINK GIVEN THE TIME IN THE EVENING I WON'T STOP THERE AND HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS AFTER THANK YOU MS ALEXANDER WE APPRECIATE THAT AND WE APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE AND FOR YOUR PRESENTATION AND OUR FINAL WITNESSES BILL MCGOVERN POLICY DIRECTOR WITH THE COALITION FOR CLEAN AIR. A WELCOME AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE MISTER MCGOVERN. THANK YOU SHARES AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. FOR INVITING ME HERE TODAY THE REGULATORY AGENCIES THAT YOU'VE HEARD FROM HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTING PREVIOUS STATUTORY DIRECTIVES FROM THE LEGISLATURE AND I THINK WHAT THE LEGISLATURE CAN MOST HELP WITH. NOW IS TO BRIDGE THAT FINANCIAL GAP. AND SPEED THE DEPLOYMENT OF CLEAN CARS TRUCKS AND BUSES WITH A PARTICULAR FOCUS ON THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE HISTORICALLY DISADVANTAGED AND LOW INCOME. WE CAME TOGETHER WITH OUR PARTNERS IN THE CHARGING A CALIFORNIA CAMPAIGN IN TWENTY FOURTEEN AND SPONSORED SENATE BILL TWELVE SEVENTY FIVE WHICH MADE IT STATE POLICY TO ELECTRIFY THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR IN A MANNER THAT ENSURES THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS ESPECIALLY THOSE MOST IMPACTED BY VEHICULAR AIR POLLUTION CAN REALIZE THE BENEFITS THAT ELECTRIC VEHICLES CAN PROVIDE. AND LARGELY AS A RESULT OF THAT LEGISLATION CALIFORNIA HAS A RICH PORTFOLIO WELL UTILIZED EQUITY FOCUSED PROGRAMS DESIGNED TO INCREASE ACCESS TO ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES AND MOBILITY IN DISADVANTAGED AND LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES ARE INCLUDING SOMETHING THAT YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT. ALREADY TODAY ALL THOSE PROJECTS ARE ARE OVERSUBSCRIBED AND OUR OLD EITHER OUT OF FUNDING FOR ALMOST OUT OF FUNDING. KNOWS LIGHT DUTY VEHICLE PROGRAMS ARE COMPLEMENTED BY A CRITICAL ZERO EMISSION MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY VEHICLE PROGRAMS THAT REDUCE TOXIC DIESEL EMISSIONS THAT WE KNOW DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACT LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES OF COLOR THAT ARE OFTEN DOWNWIND FREEWAYS CHORDS RAILYARDS WAREHOUSES AND OTHER. GOODS MOVEMENT FACILITIES. SO THEREFORE WE- THAT THE LEGISLATURE PUT INTO LAW EQUITY REQUIREMENTS THAT WOULD ASSURE THAT AT LEAST HALF OF THE ENERGY COMMISSION SCREEN TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM USED TO SUPPORT TRANSPORTATION ELECTRIFICATION THE PRIMARY BENEFIT OF OR PRIMARILY SERVING RESIDENTS OF DISADVANTAGED OR LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. OF FOR EXAMPLE BY PROVIDING THE CHARGING IN MULTI FAMILY HOUSING WHICH IS BEEN DIFFICULT TO AS WELL AS DISCUSSED EARLIER. WE ALSO RECOMMEND THATAT LEAST HALF OF THOSE PROJECTS. SB ASSOCIATED CHARGING AND REFUELING STATIONS LOCATED IN DISADVANTAGED LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AND THAT NO LESS THAN 30% OF THE PROJECT SUPPORT ZERO MISSION MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES. AND THAT INCLUDES BOTH BATTERY ELECTRIC VEHICLES AND HYDROGEN FUEL CELL ELECTRIC VEHICLES I THANK CENTER ARCHULETA WE'RE WAITING OUT THE IMPORTANCE OF HYDROGEN. THE GOVERNOR'S REQUESTED A HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE TRANSPORTATION EQUITY PROJECTS WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT RAISE TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS- BECAUSE THESE ARE THE PROGRAMS THAT EXPAND THE BENEFITS OF CLEAN MOBILITY TO ALL CALIFORNIA. AND THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD ESTIMATES THE NEED AT A HUNDRED NINETY TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT MILLION SO ACTUALLY OUR REQUEST IS ON THE LOW END THAT- AND WE SUPPORT APPROVAL OF AT LEAST. THE GOVERNOR'S REQUEST OF THREE HUNDRED FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR CLEAN TRUCKS BUSES AND OFF ROAD EQUIPMENT THERE ARE EMITTING THAT TOXIC DIESEL EXHAUST THAT IS PARTICULARLY BURDENING COMMUNITIES OF COLOR- WE ALSO ASK FOR A RE AUTHORIZATION OF THE CLEAN TRANSPORTATION AND AIR QUALITY. IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM THAT WAS LAST AUTHORIZED UNDER AB EIGHT BECAUSE IT PROVIDES INCENTIVES TO SUPPORT INNOVATION AND ACCELERATE THE DEPLOYMENT AND DEVELOPMENT FINANCE TRANSPORTATION TECHNOLOGIES AND FUELING INFRASTRUCTURE. AND WE DO SUPPORT THE SECURITIZATION OF A BILLION DOLLARS OF THE FUTURE REVENUES TO SUPPORT THE EXPANSION OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE AS WE DISCUSSED TODAY. THOSE POSITIONS THAT I JUST LAID OUT ARE ENDORSED BY SO FAR TWENTY THREE GROUPS FROM ENVIRONMENTAL ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE AND HEALTH AND LABOR ORGANIZATIONS. AND I WANT TO ADD ON BEHALF OF THE COALITION FOR CLEAN AIR THERE ARE A NUMBER OF POLICY BILLS THAT WE'RE SUPPORTING THAT WOULD ALSO HELP VERY MUCH WITH JEFF DEPLOYMENTS ABOUT YOUR GONZALEZ OF COURSE AS SENATE BILL SEVEN TWENTY SIX TO RE AUTHORIZE THE GREEN TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF BILLS TO MAKE ZERO EMISSION TRUCKS MORE AFFORDABLE INCLUDING SB THREE SEVENTY TWO BY CENTER LEYVA SB FIVE FORTY TWO BY CENTER WE'VE GROWN AND AB ELEVEN TEN BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER ROBERT RIVAS- WHEN IT COMES TO CARS ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY HAS AB TWELVE EIGHTEEN. WHICH WOULD PROVIDE SOME MORE FUNDING FOR- FOR CLEAN CARS AND MIGHT IN FACT BE ABLE TO SUPPLY SOME OF THAT NEED THAT HAS IN THE PAST BEEN SERVED. BY THE CLEAN VEHICLE REBATE PROJECT. WE ALSO NEED TO- MAKE IT EASIER TO PERMIT. THE CHARGING STATIONS SOME OF OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE ACTUALLY NOT OBSERVING CURRENT STATE LAW AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY EIGHTY NINE SEVENTY. WOULD SPEED UP THAT PROCESS OF GETTING THAT URGING STATIONS DEPLOYED. AND FINALLY CENTER MEN WHO I HAVE TO THANK FOR STAYING ON THE ZOOM- ALL THE WAY PAST FIVE O'CLOCK. AS AN EXCELLENT BILL SB FIVE HUNDRED. WHICH WOULD GUARANTEE THAT ALL AUTOMATED VEHICLES BE ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES SO- THAT'S THE ONE OTHER ONE THAT WE- IMMENSELY YOU. AND US SINCE I AM THE LAST SPEAKER ON FRIDAY AFTERNOON I WILL CLOSE THERE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR MCGOVERN WE-APPRECIATE ALL OF YOUR YOUR WORK WITH US AS WELL. THANK YOU OKAY NOW IF- FINALIZE OUR LAST PANEL WE WANT TO THANK ALL OF THE WITNESSES FOR PARTICIPATING AT THIS VERY LATE OUR ON A FRIDAY SO WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE- WE'RE GONNA GO TO MEMBER QUESTIONS AND FIRST WE HAVE SENATOR ALAN AND THEN WE'LL GO TO SENATOR MCCASKEY. YEAH I SUPPOSE THIS IS MERRY FOR THE WHOLE PANEL BUT MAYBE IF IT LET'S START WITH WITH THE MISS ALEXANDER. I LOVE YOU JUST GET A BETTER SENSE OF AND WHAT SORT OF- DASHBOARD WHAT WOULD WHAT SORT OF- OF STATS WE ARE GONNA BE COLLECTING AND THEN EVALUATING TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE PROGRAMS ARE. ARE ARE A REALLY AND SHOWING. YOU KNOW SHOWING SHOWING REAL BANG FOR BUCK- YOU KNOW. YOU KNOW THERE'S LOOK AT YOUR SOME OF THE PROJECTS A MILLION DOLLARS FOR A- IN A BIKE SHARE PROGRAM SOMETHING LIKE THAT I MEAN THE ALL SOUNDS ALL SOUNDS GREAT BUT HOW ARE WE HOW ARE WE REALLY ENSURING. THAT THESE ARE THESE ARE BEING UTILIZED BY FOLKS AND REALLY MAKING A DIFFERENCE IN IN. IN IN EASING PEOPLE TOWARD CLEANER TRANSPORTATION. THANK YOU SENATOR ALAN ARE YOU REFERRING SPECIFICALLY TO PROGRAMS LIKE CMO OR WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO COMMENT SORT OF ON METRICS OVERALL. YEAH SHOULD LOVE I LOVE BOTH AND- BECAUSE ESPECIALLY IF THEY AND THEY SIT HERE AND I SORT OF THINK TO MYSELF. YOU KNOW WE HAVE WE'RE SO WE HAVE WE HAVE WE HAVE SUCH A- SUBPAR PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM WHEN YOU COMPARE US TO. THE NEW YORKER OR OR AND OR EUROPE CERTAINLY OR JAPAN- YOU KNOW. POLICY WHEN WE LIVE WHERE WE ARE PUTTING MONEY THROUGH SB ONE ANOTHER'S IN INTO THAT IN THAT SYSTEM BUT BUT- YOU KNOW I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WITH ALL THESE INVESTMENTS REALLY ARE MAKING A DIFFERENCE- AND I AND ARE WE STUDYING B. THE DATA AND ARE AND ARE WE- BEEN CHANGING OUR- OUR- OUR- YOU KNOW OUR OUR OUR TRAJECTORY BASED ON THE DATA SO YES I'D LOVE THAT BOTH THE MACRO AND THE MICRO. PERSPECTIVE ON ON NOT. GREAT I'LL TRY TO BRIEFLY SPEAK ABOUT AND SEE IF ANY OF MY OTHER NGO COLLEAGUES HAVE THOUGHTS THAT OFTEN EQUITY ON I THINK SOME IMPORTANT. IMPORTANT METRICS ARE OBVIOUSLY WE WANT TO BE REDUCING THE ANTI WHICH IS A TREND WE HAVE NOT YET ACHIEVED IN CALIFORNIA AND SO GLOBAL CAN DOWN NECK. HOW CAN WE MAINTAIN YOU KNOW THE REDUCTIONS IN BMT AND DIFFERENT WAYS. AND WE'RE GOING TO SEE PEOPLE JUST RETURNED TO THE USE OF SINGLE OCCUPANCY AUTOMOBILES- YOU SHOULD BE TRACKING NOT VERY CLOSELY COMING OUT OF THIS PANDEMIC. AND ALSO LOOKING INTO THINGS LIKE. ARE PEOPLE YOU KNOW RETURNING TO PUBLIC TRANSIT WHAT IS THEIR ACCESS TO TRANSIT THERE ARE OTHER ORGANIZATIONS- BESIDES CAL START. MONITOR THESE THINGS VERY CLOSELY- AND AGAIN ARE ARE. PEOPLE USING LAST OF THEIR DAHLE YOU KNOW TAKE HOME PAY ON TRANSPORTATION WE KNOW THAT. LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS THEY NOT ONLY DISPROPORTIONATELY FOR HOUSING BUT BECAUSE THEY'RE LIVING FURTHER AWAY FROM THEIR JOBS THEY'RE SPENDING MORE DOLLARS- THERE IN. PERCENTAGE OF THEIR INCOME ON TRANSPORTATION SO I WOULD SAY A COUPLE OF THOSE METRICS ARE CRITICAL AND WE ARE TRACKING VERY CLOSELY THE NUMBER OF ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES AND CHARGERS AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES ACTUALLY PAYING. AND LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES WERE PRETTY MUCH ON TRACK WITH THE NUMBER OF CHARGERS FOR CAPITAL. AND N. H. BETTER BY CHAIR RANDALL SHARED THAT ALMOST TWO THIRDS OF THE DOLLARS HAVE BEEN SPENT IN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES WHICH MEANS THAT THERE ARE CLEANER VEHICLES ON THOSE ROADS. AND WE THINK THIS CLEAN VEHICLES MILES TRAVELED IS A REALLY CRITICAL METRIC I'M IN THE MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY SECTOR. I'M AND THEN OTHER METRICS WE CAN THINK OF IN TERMS OF HOW ARE WE DOING OBVIOUSLY WE NEED CHEERING I'M CONFIDENT CAR WILL DO THIS TRACK CLOSELY THE NUMBER OF DEPLOYMENTS IN EACH VEHICLE CLASS. AND HOW ARE THOSE PRICES FOR THESE VEHICLES COMING DOWN AS WE SAID AS WE HIT THESE MILESTONES. AND IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT THE INITIAL PURCHASE PRICE BUT WE'RE ALL VERY FOCUSED ON THE TOTAL COST OF OWNERSHIP. AND WHEN ARE WE GONNA REACH. PARITY WITHIN HER CLOSE TO BEING THERE. IN SOME VEHICLE CLASSES AND YOU KNOW BUT WE NEED TO BE CLOUT I AM VERY CAREFULLY TRACKING THAT METRIC IS THE RUMOR GOING TO HIT THOSE CHECKING POINTS. OUT SIMON OUR BELL- DOCTOR REACHING HAVE OTHER COMMENTS ON ON THIS QUESTION WELL I WOULD JUST ADD THAT THE AUDIT THAT SENATOR DOLLY REFERRED TO EARLIER DID IDENTIFY THAT. THERE IS MORE DATA THAT CARBS SHOULD BE COLLECTING AND ANALYZING ABOUT THE INCENTIVE PROGRAMS AND WE AGREE THAT MORE DATA WOULD BE HELPFUL. AS LONG AS IT DOESN'T YOU KNOW VARGAS DOWN SO MUCH AN ANALYSIS THAT WE STOP DOING ANYTHING BUT CARP HAS COMMITTED NOW TO GATHERING THAT DATA AND SO I THINK THAT WILL. HELP SENATOR. ALLEN TO GET WHAT YOU'RE ASKING. GREAT THANK YOU SENATOR- NAY WE HAVE DI. I NEEDED. YOU CAN YOU KNOW WE CAN HEAR YOU NOW THANK YOU ALL I HAVE A REAL QUICK QUESTION I WOULD JUST LIKE A- IF IT'S A POSSIBLE TO HAVE ALL THOSE PRESENTATIONS THAT WERE. A SLIDE PRESENTATIONS THAT WERE THAT WERE PRESENTED TODAY AVAILABLE TO- THE SENATORS ARE LEAST MYSELF I'D LIKE TO GO OVER THOSE I WOULD I WOULD. WAS REALLY INTERESTED IN THE HEAVY DUTY- SLIDE THAT THE PROFESSOR HAD- SINCE I'M IN THAT TRUCKING BUSINESS AND I'M ONE OF THOSE INDEPENDENT. TRUCKERS I'M INTERESTED THAT INFORMATION SO JUST AT GREAT JOB BY THE WAY CENTER LINO THAT STAND UP THERE ALL DAY. AFTER SHE DID STUFF AND IF I COULD JUST GET THAT INFORMATION BE HELPFUL THANK YOU ABSOLUTELY SENATOR THANK YOU- AND I HAVE JUST ONE QUESTION AND THEN WE'LL TURN IT OVER TO PUBLIC. COMMENT I KNOW THINK MS ALEXANDER YOU HAD IN YOUR SLIDES THAT. MEDIUM HEAVY DUTY COSTS 32323100% MORE- YOU HAD IT N A TIME LINE IT LOOKS LIKE AND I'M JUST TRYING TO SEE IF. THIS IS ACCURATE IT LIKE MAYBE IT TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT TIMELINE IN TERMS OF- CAN YOU CLARIFY THAT OTHER SIDE THERE WAS ANOTHER SIDE THAT HAD A TIMELINE ON TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT. YEAH I THINK YOU'RE REFERRING TO A GRAPH I SHARED THAT WAS CAL START SORT OF MODELING- INCENTIVE FUNDING. YES THEY CAN PULL THAT OFF THE FRONT EIGHT THANK YOU KNOW MANY CABBIE OUTS AROUND. LAKE THIS IS A SMALL PART OF THE FUNDING NEED THAT SIMON WAS ALLUDING TO. AND THIS IS JUST INCENTIVES WE KNOW. YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE PROVIDING AN ARTIFICIAL CAP HERE WE NOW THE DEMAND FOR EACH SAMPLE PROBABLY FAR EXCEED. FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. WE WERE YOU KNOW APPLYING SOME ARTIFICIAL CAPS IN SAYING THAT WE DIDN'T KNOW IF WE'D EVER GET A BUDGET APPROPRIATION THAT BIG BUT- WHAT WE'RE SUGGESTING HERE IS THAT. WE HOPE THERE ARE A LOT AND- MEDIUM DUTY AND SOME HEAVY DUTY VEHICLE CLASSES THAT ARE GOING TO REACH THAT TCO PARITY. SOMETIME YOU KNOW IN THE MIDDLE THIS DECADE IF WE IF WE STAY ON THAT TRAJECTORY. WE'RE AIMING FOR AND THINGS I CAN DANCE CLEAN TRUCK. SO WE COULD TAKE. VANS I THANK. THAT WE- YOU KNOW BY TWENTY FIVE WILL BE SEEN. THANK VOLUMES OF DELIVERY VAN. THEY WILL BECAUSE COMPETITIVE WITH THEIR DIESEL. OR GASOLINE COUNTERPARTS AND WE COULD START. FOR EXAMPLE PHASING THEM OUT OF EACH BED YOU KNOW TWO CREASING DOLLARS. GIVEN VEHICLES EVERY YEAR AND THEN FREEING UP THOSE DOLLARS FOR OTHER VEHICLE TYPES. AND SO THAT IN THE LATTER PART OF THIS DECADE WHEN ADVANCE CONTRACTS IS REALLY RAMPING UP ACTUALLY IN TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN. WE WILL HAVE HOPEFULLY BROUGHT. THE COST DOWN AND NOTHING DIFFERENT VEHICLE CATEGORIES THAT WE CAN PUT THOSE IN FRONT OF DOLLARS INTO TRUCKS THAT ARE JUST COMING TO THE MARKET IN THOSE LATER YEARS. I'M AND NOT SWEAR WE EXPECT TO SEE HOPEFULLY SOME LONG HAUL YOU KNOW MODELS REALLY PICKING UP AND FILLING IN THAT GAP AND THEN ALSO SEEING MORE. OF THOSE MEDIUM DUTY. WORK TRUCKS BECOMING AVAILABLE SO. AND SAY THERE IS WILL NAY IN SOME. IN THE LATER OF THE STAFF BUT HOPE FOR VIA CLASSES. OKAY THANK YOU AND- THIS IS I KNOW IT IS A TOTAL CORRECT SAID WHAT IS THE PER VEHICLE I THINK SENATOR MCCASKEY BEEN ASKING ABOUT THE PER VEHICLE TRAJECTORY. SO I DON'T KNOW IF I'M DR RICHIE MAY HAVE THAT. DATE ON THAT AS WELL BUT FOR ANY EXAMPLE I HAD A CLASS EIGHT. TRACTOR TRAILER THAT IS COMING TO MARKET FROM VOLVO OR DAIMLER WE EXPECT THE INCREMENTAL COSTS TO BE BETWEEN A DIESEL AND A ZERO EMISSION BATTERY ELECTRIC TRUCK TO BE IN THE REALM OF TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. AND YOU KNOW I DON'T HAVE A PREDICTION OF WHEN BACK COST COMES DOWN BUT WE KNOW THAT THIS SIGNIFICANT COST DIFFERENCES ALSO DUE IN PART TO THE FACT THAT THEY ARE JUST NOW ENTERING PRODUCTION. GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT MISS ALEXANDER I APPRECIATE THAT- WONDERFUL I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM SENATORS AND I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT- THE PRESENTATIONS ARE ALREADY UP- ON OUR SENATE WEBSITE FOR TRANSPORTATION HAVE TO THINK KßT FOR THAT. SO THEY'RE ALREADY UP AND DONE ALL RIGHT WITH THAT WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND- MOVE ON TO PUBLIC COMMENT AT THIS TIME.
