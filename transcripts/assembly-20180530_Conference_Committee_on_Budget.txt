PLAN ACCORDINGLY. AGAIN WE ARE VERY LUCKY TO BE. DOING BUDGET CONFERENCE WHEN REVENUES ARE GROWING. I KNOW IT WASN'T THAT LONG AGO WHERE WE FACED A VERY DAUNTING DEFICITS VERY TOUGH ECONOMIC TIMES. AND THE BUDGET CONFERENCE DISCUSSIONS WERE VERY VERY DIFFERENT. SO I FEEL VERY ON HONORED AND VERY THANKFUL THAT WE ARE ABLE TO HAVE THIS DISCUSSION DURING THESE TIMES UPON. CLEARLY WE HAD A VERY STRONG FISCAL YEAR. THE BUDGET THAT THE SENATE PROPOSED THE ASSEMBLY PROPOSES WAS WHAT THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED A SHARE OF OF NUMBER OF SIMILARITIES OF VERY VERY. SHARED VERY SIMILAR SHARED VALUES. ON. IN TERMS OF THE ASSEMBLY PROPOSAL WE HAVE A NUMBER OF. CLEAR PRIORITIES ONE WAS FEELING THE RAINY DAY FUND. TO WAS SO FULFILLING OUR PROMISE OF FULLY FUNDING THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA. AND. MAKING SURE WE FULLY FUNDED K. THROUGH TWELVE EDUCATION. ON THIRD WE WANTED TO ENSURE THAT WE CONTINUE TO MAKE PROGRESS TO EXPAND HEALTH ACCESS TO ALL CALIFORNIANS. WITH NINETY TWO PERCENT OF CALIFORNIA'S NOW HAVING A ACCESS TO HAVE OTHER HEALTH INSURANCE WE THOUGHT T WAS A TIME TO CONTINUE TO MAKE. PROGRESS FOR THE FINAL EIGHT PERCENT. FORCES OR HOMELESSNESS IS A CRISIS THAT WE ARE FACING NOT JUST IN OUR URBAN AREAS WHERE IS TRADITIONALLY BEEN THE LAST THIRTY YEARS BUT REALLY. ALL ACROSS CALIFORNIA IT'S. USED TO BE A VERY COMMON TO SEE HOMELESS FOLKS IN RURAL AREAS AND SMALLER CITIES AND NOW IT'S ALMOST COMMONPLACE. AND GIVEN THE STATE OF THE CRISIS WE THOUGHT IS VERY APPROPRIATE FOR THE STATE TO. A STEP PAN IN REALLY WORK WITH CITIES AND COUNTIES TO. FIVE SOLUTIONS AROUND EMERGENCY SHELTER AND THEN LONG TERM PERMANENT SHELTER. ITEM FIFTH. SO WE WANTED TO ENSURE THAT WE CONTINUED OUR INVESTMENT IN EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION. I KNOW TWO YEARS AGO WE MADE SOME SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS. WE OPPOSED TO BOTH HOUSES PROPOSE SOME ARE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS AND THAT'S AN AREA WHERE WE HOPE TO. BE ABLE TO REACH AGREEMENT. AND LASTLY I TO THE INSTITUTIONS THAT I KNOW MOST CALIFORNIANS ARE PROTESTANT ARE REALLY OUR UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA IN OUR CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM. THOSE TWO INSTITUTIONS DESERVE INVESTMENT. WE'VE BEEN HEARING. NOT ONLY THE STUDENTS LOT A CLEAR BUT ALSO THE FACULTY AND STAFF IN THE IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE LEADERSHIP THERE. AND WE WANT TO HER ARM ECHO THEIR. THEIR SENTIMENT FOR FURTHER INVESTMENT AND I THOUGHT BELIEVE THAT PROPOSALS PROPOSALS WERE. PUT FORTH IN BOTH THE SENATE AND THE ASSEMBLY PROPOSALS SO AGAIN. LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS THAT HAVE BEEN PUT FORWARD I THINK ARE GREAT START TO OUR CONFERENCE COMMITTEE PROCESS. SO WE HAVE A LOT MORE SOME LITERACY WE DO HAVE DIFFERENCES AND. DURING THE NEXT WEEK OR SO WE PLANNED TO IRON ALL OF THOSE OUT. TO EAT DOES WELL AS HAVE DISCUSSIONS WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IN THE GOAL WILL BE TO HAVE. YOU KNOW IN AGREEMENT SOMETIME TOWARD THE END OF NAFTA NEXT WEEK IF ALL GOES WELL. US SO VERY EXCITED AGAIN TEH BE HERE HONOR TO BE CHAIRING BUDGET CONFERENCE AGAIN AND JUST WANTED TO. OPEN UP TO SENATOR MITCHELL TO SEE IF SHE HAD ANY OPENING COMMENTS. LET'S ROCK AND ROLL. THE LOVE A SHORT SHORT AND SWEET DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. MISS COST. I'M SORT OF THE CUBICLE OF MISTER TAYLOR FIRST MISTER TAYLOR THANK YOU WAY OUT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS. YOU HAVE A VERY SHORT HAND OUT HOPEFULLY IN FRONT OF YOU. ENTITLED CONFERENCE COMMITTEE OVER YOU I'M JUST GONNA GO TO THAT. VERY QUICKLY BY THIS IS INTENDED AS THE CHAIR SUGGESTED VERY BIG PICTURE OVERVIEW OF THE PLANS. WERE THE KEY ASSUMPTIONS HOW TODAY HOUSES COMPARE AND THEN HOW TO THE HOUSES BUDGETS COMPARE WITH THE ADMINISTRATION'S SO REALLY JUST TO GIVE YOU A BIG PITCHER YOU WE HAVE A LOT MORE DETAIL IN YOUR AGENDA ON VARIOUS ITEMS THAT. I KNOW I KNOW WILL BE MORE HELPFUL TO YOU AS YOU A TICKET THOSE ON INDIVIDUALLY. UNDER OF THE FIRST PAGE COMPARING THE GENERAL FUND CONDITION THIS IS A PRETTY BASIC TABLE. THAT YOU'LL FIND IN ALMOST ANY FINANCE REALLY A DOCUMENT THAT GIVES YOU THIS SUMMER NUMBERS FOR WHERE YOU ARE IF YOU LOOK AT THE SECOND LINE REBBETZIN TRANSFERS. YOU SEE THAT THE SENATE ASSEMBLY ARE HIGHER THAN THE. AT ADMINISTRATION THAT'S BECAUSE THEY ARE YOU HAVE ADOPTED OUR REVENUE ESTIMATES I GO INTO A LITTLE MORE IN JUST A SECOND. AND AS A RESULT YOUR EXPENDITURES ARE ALSO HIGHER. BECAUSE THEY'RE SIMILAR AMOUNTS YOU GO DOWN TO THE RESERVES AND IS THE CHAIR NOTED ALL THREE THE ADMINISTRATION IN BOTH HOUSES HAVE RESERVE LEVELS THAT ARE OVER SEVENTEEN BILLION DOLLARS. THE SENATE HAS ACTUALLY INCREASED RESERVES. THEY HAVE USED. I KNEW RESERVE THAT THEY AS A SAFETY NET RESERVE THAT'S NOT IN MONIES THAT ARE IN THE BSA THEY'RE NOT IN EFFECT PROTECTED UNDER THE RULES OF PROPOSITION TWO. BUT THEY ARE UP OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THE INTENT IS TO SET THOSE ASIDE AND THEY WOULD BE USED. IN IN SIMILAR FASHION AS OTHER RESERVES. TARGETED TOWARDS SHORTFALLS IN HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES PROGRAMS IN THE FUTURE BUT IT IS IT IS A RESERVE AND SO WE'VE SHOWN IT DOWN THERE. THE ASSEMBLY TOOK A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT ACTION. THEY'VE SET UP WHAT THEY CALL THE. THE BUDGET DEFICIT SAVINGS ACCOUNT THESE ARE FUNDS THAT THE LEGISLATURE MAINTAINS A LITTLE MORE CONTROL THROUGHOUT THE FISCAL YEAR AT THE END OF MAY THOUGH IF ALL THE ESTIMATES ARE EXTRA WHAT WE THINK THEY ARE. THAT MONEY WHICH IS GOING TO THE BSA AND THE TOTAL WOULD BE NO DIFFERENT FROM WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS. GIVEN THESE RESERVES AND THESE LEVELS ARE ALMOST UNPRECEDENTED THESE ARE. VERY HEALTHY RESERVE LEVELS AND I THINK THIS STATE HAS DONE AN EXCELLENT JOB THE LEGISLATURE WORKING WITH THE GOVERNOR. TO ESTABLISH THIS LEVEL RESERVE LEVELS OF OF RESERVES. WITH THESE YOU COULD LIKELY WITHSTAND A MILD RECESSION. WITHOUT HAVING TO TAKE. MUCH. SIGNIFICANT ACTION AS FAR AS CHANGING YOUR SPENDING LEVELS ARE YOUR REVENANTS. A MILD RECESSION. ANYTHING MORE THAN THAT IT WOULD STILL PROVIDE YOU QUITE A BIT OF TIME. TO ADJUST TO ANY DOWNTURN. SO THE THESE ARE SIGNIFICANT LEVELS OF RESERVES. YOU CAN HAVE DISCUSSIONS WHETHER YOU WANT TO HAVE MORE. OR NOT YOU CAN SEE THE SENATE IS A LITTLE BIT HIGHER THAN THE ASSEMBLY PLAN. BUT BUT THESE ARE. HEALTHY LEVELS AND IT SHOWS INCREDIBLE PROGRESS OVER RECENT YEARS. YOU ALSO ANOTHER WAY THAT YOU HAVE PROTECTION AGAINST DOWNTURN IN ADDITION TO RESERVES ARE ONE TIME SPENDING. BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE ONE TIME SPENDING. THAT GOES AWAY IN THE NEXT YEAR YOU DON'T HAVE TO MAKE AS MANY ADJUSTMENTS. SO ONE THING TO KEEP. THE COGNITIVE IS HOW MUCH ONE TIME SPENDING TO HEAR. NOW THE ADDITIONAL COMMITMENTS THAT THE SENATE MADE ON TOP OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. THEY MAKE ABOUT A THIRD A LITTLE OVER THIRTY ONE TIME THE ASSEMBLY MAKES ABOUT HALF OF THEIR. AUGMENTATIONS AND ONE TIME JUST SOMETHING TO KEEP IN MIND. NOW OFF SETTING THAT IS THAT EACH HOUSE HAS A LOUD RATHER LARGE EXPENDITURE THAT GROWS OVER TIME. AND AGAIN WE'LL TALK A BIT MORE ABOUT THAT THIS IN ITS COWARDS PROPOSAL IS PHASED IN SUCH AS IT GROWS THE COST GROW OVER TIME. AND THE HOUSE HAS A ABOUT THE ASSEMBLY HAS A HEALTH PROPOSAL THAT WOULD GROW OVER TIME. NOW THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU CAN'T HAVE PROPOSALS THAT GROW IN THE OUT YEARS. WHAT IT MEANS IS YOU WANT TO JUST BE SENSITIVE TO TO EITHER OF THE SENATE'S APPROACH ON RESERVES WELL MAYBE WHEN I HAVE A FEW MORE RESERVES? OR THE ASSEMBLY IS APPROACHING ONE TIME MAYBE ONE HAVE SOME MORE ONE TIME. THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT YOU BALLOTS IN MAKING YOUR DECISIONS. WE GO TO PAGE TWO. THIS THIS THIS REALLY HELPS EXPLAIN HOW YOU'RE DIFFERENT FROM THE GOVERNOR'S. AND THE HOUSES ARE FAIRLY MUCH THEY'RE VERY SIMILAR IN HOW THEY DIFFER FROM THE GOVERNOR. THAT SINGLE BIGGEST ASSUMPTION IS AS I MENTIONED YOU'VE TAKEN OUR ESTIMATES OF REVENANTS. IT'S ABOUT TWO POINT SEVEN TWO POINT EIGHT THERE'S A SLIGHT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HOUSES. NOW THAT SEEMS LIKE A LOT OF MONEY BECAUSE IT IS ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT SPENDING. FROM A REVENUE ESTIMATING PERSPECTIVE. THIS IS A TWO YEAR DIFFERENCE IT'S A LITTLE OVER ONE PERCENT A YEAR. THAT'S NOT A HUGE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ADMINISTRATION AND US. AND IT'S JUST THAT WE HAVE DIFFERENT METHODOLOGIES OF ESTIMATING REVENUES. AND YOU DECIDED TO GO WITH OURS SO THAT GIVES YOU ALMOST THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN ADDITIONAL RESOURCES NOW AS A RESULT OF TAKING THOSE REVENUES YOU HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL RESERVE REQUIREMENTS AS YOU SEE ONLINE TO. SOME ADDITIONAL PROPOSITION TO DEBT REQUIREMENTS THOSE OFFSET YOUR GAINES. YOU'D MADE ANOTHER ASSUMPTION BOTH HOUSES THAT YOU WOULD USE OUR PROPERTY TAX REVENUES. THAT DOESN'T CHANGE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT AT ALL. IT JUST CHANGES THAT THE CONSISTENCY THE MAKE UP OF BETWEEN GENERAL FUND IMPROPER TAXES SO YOU HAVE LESS GENERAL FUND THAT THAT YOU HAVE TO DEDICATE TOWARDS NINETY EIGHT. THAT'S FREED UP IN YOUR AVAILABLE FOR OTHER PURPOSES. THEN ONE OTHER KEY CHANGE IN THINKING ABOUT WHAT WHAT'S YOUR TOTAL AMOUNT YOU HAVE DIFFERENT FROM THE GOVERNOR. IS THAT BOTH HOUSES REJECTED SOME OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS. PARTICULARLY IN THE AREA OF INFRASTRUCTURE AND DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. GO TO THE BOTTOM LINE THERE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES AVAILABLE THE SENATE HAS ABOUT THREE AND A HALF BILLION ALMOST. THE ASSEMBLY HAS FOUR BILLION ON TOP OF WHAT THE GOVERNOR HAD. WHAT DID YOU DO WITH THOSE THE HOUSES DID A LOT OF THINGS THE SAME? BUT THE SENATE AS YOU CAN SEE TOOK FROM THAT THAT THREE POINT FOR THAT THEY HAD THEY SET UP THAT NEW RESERVE THAT I TALKED ABOUT. THAT'S SET ASIDE. A RESERVE FOR THE SAFETY NET. THEN THEY MADE NEW COMMITMENTS AND THESE ARE PRIMARILY EXPENDITURES THERE ARE SOME REVENUE REDUCTIONS TO SOME OF THAT'S WHY WE USE THE WORD COMMITMENT. OF TWO POINT NINE BILLION. NOW ANYBODY DOING THEIR QUICK MATH WOULD SEE THAT WELL THAT'S THREE POINT NINE IN NEW. AND YET WE HAVE THREE POINT FOR AN ADDITIONAL RESOURCES AND WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT'S WHY IF YOU LOOK ON THE PRIOR PAGE. THEIR REGULAR RESERVE OUR SFU YOU AS WE REFER TO IT. IS ACTUALLY LESS THAN THE ADMINISTRATION'S. I THE ASSEMBLY JUST MAKES FOUR BILLION IN NEW COMMITMENTS. SO IF YOU GO THE LAST PAGE THIS REALLY SHOWS. SOME OF THE REALLY BIG PIECES OF THOSE LEGISLATIVE AUGMENTATIONS TO THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. AND. IT IT'S NOT GOING TO TELL YOU THE WHOLE STORY FOR EXAMPLE ON HOMELESSNESS THE FIRST ITEM THAT WE HAVE. THESE ARE JUST EIGHTEEN NINETEEN NUMBER SO IT DOESN'T SHOW THE SENATE'S PLAN WHICH AS A FOUR YEAR PLAN. YOU HAVE A TABLE LATER ON IN YOUR AGENDA THAT WILL GIVE YOU ALL THAT DETAIL. BUT WHAT WE TRY TO DO IS TO SHOW YOU THE AMOUNT IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN PLUS ENTRANCE IT SHOWS WHAT IS ONGOING IN ONGOING WE MEAN ON A PERMANENT BASIS NOT LIKE THE FOUR YEAR FOR HOMELESSNESS. JUST SO YOU CAN GET AN IDEA OF WHEN ARE YOU MAKING ONE TIME COMMITMENTS WHEN ARE YOU MAKING ONGOING COMMITMENTS. I THINK WHAT IS IS A. STANDS OUT IN THIS LIST IS HOW MANY. SIMILARITIES THERE ARE BETWEEN THE HOUSES. BOTH SIDES PROVIDED A LOT MORE MONEY TO HOMELESSNESS. BOTH SIDES PROVIDED MORE MONEY FOR HEALTH CARE. THE ASSEMBLY CLEARLY WENT FURTHER. SENATE IS THE ONLY ONE TO TAKE ACTION ON THE CAL WORKS IN SSI GRANTS BOTH RAISING THEM AND PROVIDING COLIN'S. THE ASSEMBLY DID MORE ON OTHER AREAS IN HUMAN SERVICE THE SERVICES NOTHING REAL BIG THERE'S A LOT OF SMALLER THINGS THAT MAKES UP THAT. THREE HUNDRED SIX MILLION THAT WE SIDE UNDER THAT. BOTH SIDES HAVE SIGNIFICANT AUGMENTATIONS FOR THE UNIVERSITIES THE CHAIR NOTED BOTH SIDES BASICALLY DO THE SAME THING FOR CHILDCARE ON AN ONGOING BASIS. THE ASSEMBLY ALSO PUT IN SOME ONE TIME MONEY. BOTH SIDES HAVE ONE TIME MONEY FOR REENTRY DIVERSION PROGRAMS AND THE CENSUS. AND THE SENATE IS THE WHAT IS THE ONLY SIDE THAT DID A TO GET ADDITIONAL ACTION TO AUGMENT. THE JUDICIAL BRANCH. SO THOSE ARE YOU REALLY THE BIG PIECES SUBURBS ADDITIONAL. THOSE NEW RESOURCES AND HOW YOU WERE THEY WERE USED BY THE TWO HOUSES. HOT WITH THAT MISTER CHAIRMAN OBVIOUSLY MY COLLEAGUES WILL BE HERE TO HELP YOU THROUGH YOUR AGENDA AND WE'RE HERE AS ALWAYS TO PROVIDE. WHATEVER ASSISTANCE WE CAN TO HELP YOU GET A CONFERENCE REPORT. THANK YOU MISTER WITH COST. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN WAS ANY COST WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I'LL TRY NOT TO DUPLICATE THE ANALYST TESTIMONY I AM JUST PROVIDING A BIG OVERVIEW BUT I WILL PROVIDE. SOME COMMENTS FROM THE ADMINISTRATION SOME OF THE BIG. ITEMS THAT HE'S REFERENCE AS FAR AS REVENUES EXPENDITURES AND RESERVE FUNDS WHICH ARE REALLY KIND OF THE KEY STRUCTURES OF ANY BUDGET. ON AB AND ASSIST TESTIFIED AS I'VE TESTIFIED IN BOTH OF THE RESPECTIVE HOUSES A THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN THE REVENUE ASSUMPTIONS BETWEEN THE ADMINISTRATION AND AND AND THE ADOPTED BUDGET. ON ITS ROUGHLY TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION IS THE ANALYST'S NOTES WITH A SLIGHT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE HOUSES BEHIND THE ASSEMBLY DID NOT. ADOPT THE ALEJO'S CORPORATION TAX. I'M SO THERE'S A SLIGHT DOLLAR DIFFERENCE THERE. I THINK OUR SERIOUS CONCERNS ADOPTING AN OVERLY OPTIMISTIC REVENUE FORECAST ARE THAT. MUCH OF THE DIFFERENCE I'M AT THE HOUSE POINTS OUT BY A PERCENTAGE BASIS. IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE A A BIG DOLLAR AMOUNT HOWEVER THE SOURCE OF REVENUE THAT IS UNDERLYING THE DIFFERENCE IS THE PERSONAL INCOME TAX AND CAPITAL GAINS BOTHOF WHICH ARE EXTREMELY VOLATILE. AND HAD TRADITIONALLY VERY DIFFICULT TO PREDICTS. ON AS SUCH AND WE'VE OFTEN NOTED ONE PERCENT OF TAXPAYERS PAY NEARLY FIFTY PERCENT OF THE PERSONAL INCOME TAX IN THE STATE. SO THAT GIVES YOU AN UNDERSTANDING OF HOW ON SENSITIVE THAT PARTICULAR REVENUE SOURCES. THE LA OWES REVENUE FORECAST AND FINANCE FORECAST BOTH PROJECT HIGH GROWTH IN CAPITAL GAINS WITH. BOTH PROJECTIONS ARE MAKING THEM SUBJECT TO PRETTY SIGNIFICANT DOWNSIDE RISK. WE WOULD KNOW THAT THE CURRENT ECONOMIC EXPANSION IS NEARING. THE LONGEST IN HISTORY WE'VE LISTED POTENTIAL RISKS TO THE REVENUE FORECAST. THAT INCLUDE A RECESSION STOCK MARKET CORRECTION AND THE FEDERAL ARE GOVERNMENT SHIFTING COSTS DOWN TO THE STATE AS WELL AS TRADE WARS. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT REST CABS INTENSIFIED SINCE WE RELEASED IN JANUARY UNTIL NOW WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAVING PROPOSALS FOR RECISIONS SO. THAT RISK ITSELF HASN'T CHANGED BUT WE WOULD ARGUE THAT HAS INTENSIFIED AND IT DOES I POSE A THREAT ONTO THE OVERALL. BUDGET WENT DOWN. IN THE EXPENDITURES I WILL GIVE YOU A PREVIEW OF WHAT YOU'LL HEAR ME SAY LIKELY THROUGHOUT MUCH OF CONFERENCE WHICH IS THAT. THE PROPOSED AUGMENTATIONS CANNOT B SUPPORTED BY THE ADMINISTRATION GIVEN THE RAVENOUS AND SO ON MANY TIMES THAT WILL BE WITHOUT PREJUDICE TO A PARTICULAR PROPOSAL OBVIOUSLY. FOR WORKING OFF A DIFFERENT TOTAL NUMBERS ON THE REVENUE SIDE. THE ADMINISTRATION WANTS TO ENSURE THAT ANY OF THE EXPENDITURES THAT ARE INCLUDED IN THE BUDGET REALLY ALIGNED WITH OUR HOW MORE REASONABLE REVENUE ASSUMPTIONS PREVENT PUSHING. THE BUDGET OUT OF BALANCE AND TO PROTECT AGAINST MORE SIGNIFICANT BUDGET CUTS IN THE FUTURE. THE TYPES OF EXPENDITURES ARE IMPORTANT IN THE STRUCTURE OF THE BUDGET WHILE AND ALICE POINTED OUT AND YOU KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ONGOING AND ONE TIME EXPENDITURES IN THE ADMINISTRATION'S BUDGET WE'VE REALLY LIMITED ON GOING. EXPENDITURES. SO THAT WE CAN AVOID. CUTS TO PROGRAMS WHEN THERE IS A RECESSION. ON EACH HOUSE IS INCLUDED BILLIONS IN ADDITIONAL NON NINETY GENERAL FUND EXPENDITURES. IN SOME CASES THE ADMINISTRATION BELIEVES THAT THE COSTS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY UNDERSTATED BASED ON WHAT THE HOUSES OF ADOPTED. THESE NON NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND ONGOING EXPENDITURES ALSO GROW. PRETTY SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE OUT YEARS SPECIFICALLY AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. WITH THE SENATE BUDGET ONGOING SPENDING AT LEAST FOUR POINT FIVE BILLION AND THE ASSEMBLIES AT AT LEAST TWO. IT'S BILLION. LET'S THEY WANTED TO TALK BRIEFLY ABOUT THE RESERVES WHICH IS THE ADMINISTRATION HAS FREQUENTLY DISCUSSED THE NEED FOR ROBUST RESERVES ONTO ASSESSED AND WEATHERING THE NEXT RECESSION. WE ARE PLEASED THAT EACH OF THE HOUSES AS FULLY FUNDED THE RAINY DAY FUND AT THAT CONSTITUTIONAL TARGET OF TEN PERCENT. I'M AS THE ANALYST NOTED THE SENATE HAS PROPOSED A SAFETY NET OF A RESERVE OF ONE BILLION DOLLARS WHICH WOULD INCLUDE FUNDING TO HELP PROVIDE SOME MEASURE OF STABILITY FOR CAL WORKS AYE WHICH OFTEN FACES CUTS DURING ECONOMIC DOWNTURNS WHEN I CASELOAD IS INCREASING. ARE THE ASSEMBLY HAS PROPOSED A BUDGET DEFICIT SAVINGS ACCOUNT WHICH WOULD TEMPORARILY HOLD SUPPLEMENT A SUBLIMINAL PORTION OF THE BUDGET YEAR RAINY DAY. UP FUND DEPOSIT UNTIL JUNE TWENTY NINETEEN BUT COULD IN THE FUTURE BE UTILIZED AS ANOTHER RESERVE FUND TO HELP DURING A RECESSION. WE WELCOME CONTINUING OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH THE LEGISLATURE AS WE MOVE THROUGH THE CONFERENCE PROCESS. BUT THAT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU MISS COSTA COMING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE TO ANY OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS WANT TO MAKE. STATEMENTS AS WELL AS. QUESTIONS SENATOR MORLOCK. THANK YOU RICH CHAIR I'LL MOVE THE SENATE TO OUR RECOMMENDATIONS. JUST GETTING JUST KIDDING WEBSITE BETTER. I WAS I WAS READING. OKAY WE SPENT MANY HOURS TOGETHER LAST YEAR SO WHERE. THERE THERE IS A. I DON'T THINK YOU MISTER CHAIR I. I'M JUST WONDERING MR TAYLOR HAVING COME FROM THE LOCAL. SO I DOUBT WHEN WE WENT THROUGH A RECESSION. THE STATE WAS REALLY GOOD ABOUT TAKING LOCAL FUNDS AWAY. FILL BUDGET GAPS. AND LOCAL LEVELS CITIES AND COUNTIES ONLY HAVE MAYBE WILL. ONE VEHICLE TO RAISE MORE REVENUE AND THAT'S A SALES TAX INCREASE WHICH SEEMS TO BE A LITTLE MORE POPULAR MORE ON. BUT MORE BALLOTS TO TO RAISE REVENUES BECAUSE OF GROWING PENSION COSTS. IT CENTER SO THEY'RE VERY LIMITED BUT THE STATE HAS BEEN ENJOYING. THIS. WE USE THE TERM SURPLUS. SO WE WE GOT GAS TAX WE'VE GOT. ALL INCOME TAX ALL THE EVERYTHING IN PLACE IT'S GIVING. PERHAPS HE'S EXTRA REVENUES. AND AND I JUST WONDER. IN TIMES OF BOUNTY IS IT POSSIBLE FOR THE. STATE TO GIVE A LITTLE BACK TO THE LOCAL LEVELS. BECAUSE THEY'RE GOOD ABOUT TAKING IT IN TOUGH TIMES I JUST DON'T KNOW THE LAW BUT I JUST THOUGHT MAYBE YOU MIGHT HAVE A PERSPECTIVE. WELL I THINK AS YOU POINTED OUT THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS WE DO GIVE MORE MONEY BACK TO LOCALS SCHOOL SPENDING HAS GROWN SIGNIFICANTLY. THAT GOES TO LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS EVEN THOUGH OBVIOUSLY THE STATE. A CONTROLS A LOT OF THE OVERALL FUNDING BUT IT HAS INCREASED A LOT OF THE GAS TAX MONIES GOES TO LOCAL CONTROL. I KNOW IN SOME OF THE HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICE CENTER MITCHELL CROPS BECAUSE BETTER NIGHT BUT THERE'S BEEN EFFORTS TO INCREASE COUNTY ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS SO. ICE I IMAGINE SCATTERED THROUGHOUT THEIR IF SOMETHING THAT CERTAINLY HAVE A BENEFICIAL EFFECT. IF YOU'RE ASKING SHOULD WE THINK BROAD MORE BROADLY ABOUT LOCAL RELIEF. THAT'S A DIFFICULT ONE FOR ME TO ADDRESS I'M NOT SURE WHAT FORM THAT WOULD TAKE. UP ONE OTHER AREA WHERE I KNOW THE LEGISLATURE HAS BEEN REALLY CONCERNED HAS HAS BEEN ABOUT LOCAL PENSION COST. BOTH FOR SCHOOLS AND FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND I'M NOT SURE THERE'S MUCH IN. THIS BUDGET ON THAT BUT THAT IS CERTAINLY A AND AN AREA THAT'S GOTTEN A LOT OF CONVERSATION. WELL I YOU KNOW JUST KIND OF THINKING OUT OF THE BOX AND NOT KNOWING ALL THE RULES. IF WE WORK TO GIVE. YOU KNOW SINCE WE HAVE WE'RE TALKING NINE BILLION IF WE WERE TO SAY LET'S TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF THAT. GIVE IT TO CITIES AND COUNTIES BUT JUST SPECIFICALLY DESIGNATED FOR THEIR PENSION. PLANS AS A CONTRIBUTION THAT WAVE WE SORT OF DO A REBATE BECAUSE A REYES HAS WHAT YOU GOT TOO MUCH IN TAX REVENUE. YOU GIVE BACK TO TAXPAYERS BUT THIS TO BE A WAY TO GIVE BACK TO THE TAXPAYERS IN AN INDIRECT WAY. AND IT WOULD HELP MAYBE CITIES AND COUNTIES TO KEEP A POLICE OFFICER PER YEAR TWO OR. SO LONGER AVERAGE JUST AN IDEA SIDE. WHEN THERE SHOULD CERTAINLY I KNOW THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TALK ABOUT WHAT MIGHT BE DONE ON SCHOOL DISTRICTS. WHO ARE? CERTAINLY FACING EVEN HIRING CREASES IN THE OUT YEARS ABOUT WHAT MIGHT BE DONE TO HELP THEM AND CERTAINLY BY GIVING A LOT OF MONEY ON THEY'LL CFF THAT IS DISCRETIONARY MONEY. THAT DOES HELP THEM SO IT IT IT'S A LITTLE HARD TO STOP THE CUT THE ANSWER YOUR QUESTION BUT IT'S A GOOD ONE. HOW YOU THINK ABOUT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AT THIS DURING THESE GOOD TIMES AND I'M WONDERING ON A DIFFERENT SUBJECT OF? GAS BEES CAN REQUIRE THAT THE STATE REPORT ON ITS. COMPREHENSIVE ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT AS OF JUNE THIRTY THIS YEAR. THE RETIREE MEDICAL LIABILITY WHICH THE CONTROLLER SAID IS NINETY ONE AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS. DO WE HAVE A WAY OF PAYING THAT DOWN OTHER THAN JUST WITHHOLDING FROM EMPLOYEES. WELL I THINK THE WHOLE THE GOOD THE ADMINISTRATION'S WHOLE PRE FUNDING PLAN. THAT HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED THROUGH THE VARIOUS COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS IS TO TRY TO ADDRESS THAT. I DON'T KNOW WHAT AT WHAT POINT YOU CAN CHANGE YOUR YOUR INTEREST EARNING ASSUMPTION THAT WOULD REDUCE THOSE LIABILITIES DRAMATICALLY A FORGET THE POINT AT WHICH YOU HAVE TO. YOU KNOW HAVE SHOWN PROGRESS IN IN IN FINDING THOSE LIABILITIES BUT. CERTAINLY THE ADMINISTRATION HAS HAS HAD HAS THIS PLAN THAT IS BEING IMPLEMENTED THROUGH THE VARIOUS COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS THAT OVER TIME. WE'LL GET THOSE THE SPREE FUNDED. CAVEMAN THEN. YOU MENTIONED TO. STRATEGIES OF DEALING WITH THE RECESSION THE FIRST IS TO USE OUR RESERVES. THE SECOND IS THAT WE'RE DOING ONE TIME PAYMENT SO WE STOP THOSE IS THEIR STRATEGY. SINCE WE'RE ALL HERE PER SHORT TIME OVERLOOKING A LONG TERM HORIZON WHERE WHEN THERE IS A RECESSION WE HAVE SORT OF A STRATEGY OF WHAT WEAK AT FIRST. OR PRIORITY LIKE AS WERE ADDING THINGS. THE WEEK WE GIVE THEM A RANK SO THAT'S OKAY IF WE HAVE A DECLINE IN REVENUES OF OUR ONE PERCENTERS. DON'T. PRODUCE BECAUSE OF A DOWNTURN NO CAPITAL GAINS. DO WE DO WE CAN HELP THE NEXT ADMINISTRATION. OR ADMINISTRATIONS ON. YOU KNOW WHERE THE PRIORITY IS IN REVERSE POINT YOU CERTAINLY CAN DO THAT I THINK WHAT'S DIFFICULT IS NO LEGISLATURE CAN TIE THE HANDS OF A FUTURE LEGISLATION. EVEN IF IT'S A LOT OF THE SIMILAR MEMBERSHIP. SO WHAT YOU MAY THINK OUR PRIORITIES NOW MAY NOT BE THE PRIORITIES THAT YOU THINK ARE FOR EVEN FOUR YEARS FROM NOW. SO IT I THINK YOU CAN THINK ABOUT THAT AND SORT OF BROAD TERMS BUT I THINK IT'S REALLY HARD ONCE YOU GET DOWN TO THE NITTY GRITTY OF FOR THIS IS WHAT WE WOULD. CUT OFF YOU KNOW OFF THE TOP. BECAUSE THOSE PRIORITIES CAN CHANGE. SO IT'S IT'S OF ITS A HEALTHY WAY TO GO ABOUT DOING IT ANOTHER WAY TO THINK ABOUT IT IS HOW MUCH FLEXIBILITY DO YOU HAVE. I KNOW THERE'S REALLY STRONG FEELINGS THAT SOMETHING SHOULD BE CONTINUOUSLY APPROPRIATED SOME STATUTES COALITION BE IN LAW. WHO ARE WE UNDERSTAND WHAT WHERE THAT COMES FROM YOU WANNA GIVE SEND SIGNALS TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO COUNTY TO SCHOOLS THAT GIVE AND CERTAINLY ON THE OTHER HAND IT TAKES AWAY YOUR FLEXIBILITY? BECAUSE IT'S MUCH HARDER TO CHANGE A STATUTORY GOAL THEN JUST MAKE YOUR DECISIONS ON ON YOUR ANNUAL BASIS. SO THERE ARE THERE ARE OTHER TOOLS YOU CAN THINK ABOUT OF HOW HOW DO WE MAKE SURE WE MAINTAIN OUR FLEXIBILITY ONCE WE GET TO THAT POINT WHERE WE HAVE TO MAKE TOUGH DECISIONS. TAYLOR THINKS RICHER. IF THEY THINK YOU CENTER FOR THE ARE A GREAT QUESTION I WOULD WANT TO NOTE THAT IN BOTH BY. SENATE AND ASSEMBLY PROPOSALS ARE QUITE ON A NUMBER OF AUGMENTATIONS WHICH GO DIRECTLY TO COUNTIES I KNOW AROUND HOUSING HOMELESSNESS HUMAN SERVICES. NOT PUBLIC SAFETY COURTS ON SCIENCE I THINK THAT WE ARE WE'RE VERY COGNIZANT OF WHAT. IMPACT THEIR WORLD LOCALLY THEN DETROIT I THINK BOTH HOUSES TO TRY TO ADDRESS THEM. OTHER OTHER QUESTIONS FROM A MEMBER SIR NIELSEN. MISTER TAYLOR WHO. THE ONE THING THAT. A LEGISLATURE NOW CAN DO. AND A BIT OBLIGES ALL LEGISLATURE'S UNTIL PROP TWO WOULD BE REPEALED AS PROP TWO. THAT IS ONE MAJOR THING THAT OF MANY OF US HAVE BEEN SEEKING FOR MANY MANY YEARS THEN IT SEEMS TO BE. ACCEPTED IN FACT EVEN MORE BRACED. THAT HAS MY QUESTION. IN THIS BUDGET. ADDITIONAL. THE RESERVE IS BENT BODY AND FLORA. I GUESS WOULD BE. A PARACHUTE ALLOWED MORE THAN MAYBE JUST. A SOFT LANDING. DIGITAL THAT SEEM TO YOU TO BE A HELPFUL STRATEGY. THAT WE HAVE NOW CREATED OUR OWN IF YOU WILL RESERVE FOR CERTAIN. SET ASIDE. FUNDING WHERE IT KIND OF GOES TO CENTER MORLOCKS QUESTION OF WHERE WE SIGNAL OUR PRIORITIES. DID THE I THINK OF THE BILLION DOLLARS IS JUST ANOTHER PARTY RESERVE YOUR BSA HAS TOPPED OFF SO IF YOU WANT TO SET ASIDE MONEY AS OPPOSED TO SPENDING IT NOW OR COMMITTING IT NOW. IT'S IT'S GOOD THAT YOU JUST SET IT ASIDE. THAT THERE IS NOTHING THAT WOULD PREVENT YOU FROM USING THAT ON ANYTHING THAT YOU THOUGHT WERE HIGHER PRIORITY IT'S JUST A SIGNALING THAT THIS IS WHAT WE WANTED TO AND THAT CAN HAVE THAT CAN BE POWERFUL. BUT IT'S NOT MINDINGIT ANYWAY SO FOR ME THE MORE IMPORTANT POINT IS THAT YOU'VE INCREASED THE SENATE HAS INCREASED THEIR RESERVES. AND THE TARGETING IS I THINK MORE FOR YOU FOR YOU ALL OF HOW MUCH SORT OF SIGNALING. DO WE WANT TO DO HOW DO WE WANT TO CHANGE THE SORT OF DEFAULT IN% THE FUTURE OF. WE SET THAT ASIDE FOR THESE PROGRAMS AND WE LIKE TO MAINTAIN THOSE COMMITMENTS. BUT IT'S I THINK THE MORE POWERFUL THING IS YOU PRESERVED YOU'VE INCREASED YOUR RESERVE LEVELS. AND AND I LAW THAT THAT'S THAT'S A VERY GOOD DIRECTION I THINK. I'M WARY THOUGH AS WE BUILD A BUDGET. THAT WE DO THINGS THAT ARE. BASE BUILDING A COLLEGE THAT. GONNA RAISE. THE BASE AMOUNT FOR EVERY PREACHER BUDGET WILL BE BUILT UPON. AND PART OF OUR PROBLEMS IN THE PAST HAVE BEEN IN FACT THAT VERY POINT. AND ONE OTHER POINTED OUT CAUTION THAT HAPPENED NOT TOO MANY YEARS AGO WHEN THERE WAS A FAIRLY SUBSTANTIAL SURPLUS AND. AND THAT MONEY WAS SPENT. THEN THAT GREATLY CONTRIBUTED TO THE DISASTROUS FORTY FIVE BILLION DOLLAR. DEFICIT THAT WE THEN LATER INCURRED RIGHT YES ALTHOUGH IN THIS CASE I THINK I WOULD THINK OF A MORE IS NOT BASED BUILDING IF YOU TALK ABOUT THE ONE BILLION. THAT'S MORE LIKE BASS PROTECTION YET NOT ALLOWED THE RESERVE I AGREE YEAH I AGREE WITH THAT YOU'RE ABOUT THE OTHER DECISION YES YES. THANK YOU MISTER OPEN OUT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF MISTER TAYLOR LIKE TO FOLLOW UP ON SENATOR NIELSEN'S QUESTION. ABOUT RESERVES SO AND THE TO DO BUDGETS BEFORE US THE SENATE'S CREATED A NEW RESERVE ACCOUNT THEY'RE CALLING THE SAFETY NET RESERVE THE. ASSEMBLY IS CREATED NEW BUDGET DEFICIT SAVINGS ACCOUNT BUT WE ALREADY HAVE A RESERVE FUND SPECIAL FUND FOR ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY. THAT UNLIKE THE BUDGET STABILIZATION ACCOUNT DOES NOT HAVE A THE STATUTORY CAP ON IT SO WHY DO WE NEED TO CREATE THESE NEW ACCOUNTS WHY NOT JUST PUT THESE THIS MONEY AND TO. THE SFU THAT'S AN ALTERNATIVE FOR YOU TO DO. ALL RIGHT. THANKS SO CERTAINLY WHAT WHAT I WOULD DO. YOU PRINCIPLE POINT OF DOING. OTHER COMMENTS. THIS IS A VERY QUIET BUDGET CONFERENCE SO ON. THAT ARE VERY MUCH I APPRECIATE ALL THE COMMENTS AND FEEDBACK. WELL WE WILL ADJOURN TODAY AND RE ADJOURN TOMORROW AT TEN THIRTY. THANK YOU
