00:08:42.154 --> 00:08:43.789
IS A FOUNDATIONAL SERVICES

ADMINISTRATIVE CAPABILITIES.

00:09:19.992 --> 00:09:21.327
EACH OF THESE CAPABILITIES IS

00:09:21.394 --> 00:09:22.595
ESSENTIAL FOR EVERY SINGLE

00:09:22.662 --> 00:09:24.030
SOLITARY HEALTH DEPARTMENT AND

00:09:27.667 --> 00:09:29.101
AS WELL AS TO ADAPT TO THE EVER

00:09:29.168 --> 00:09:31.470
CHANGING ENVIRONMENT THAT PUBLIC

00:09:31.537 --> 00:09:33.973
HEALTH FINDS ITSELF IN.

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:35.708
AND THESE CAPABILITIES.

00:09:35.775 --> 00:09:37.944
RESIDE IN THE STAFF WHO WORK IN

00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:39.879
PUBLIC HEALTH IN THEIR EXPERTISE

00:09:39.946 --> 00:09:41.480
AND THEIR EXPERIENCE.

00:09:41.547 --> 00:09:42.715
BUT IT'S THIS VERY

00:09:42.782 --> 00:09:44.550
INFRASTRUCTURE OF TRAINED

00:09:44.617 --> 00:09:45.885
SKILLED PEOPLE.

00:09:45.952 --> 00:09:47.653
THAT HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:49.588
ERODED OVER THE PAST DECADE YES

00:09:49.655 --> 00:09:51.123
WE ALSO NEED OUR DATA SYSTEMS

00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:52.591
THE OTHER HARD CORE BUT THE

00:09:52.658 --> 00:09:53.592
REALLY AT THE HEART OF PUBLIC

00:09:53.659 --> 00:09:54.327
HEALTH.

00:09:54.393 --> 00:09:56.595
ARE THE PEOPLE WHO DO THAT WORK

00:09:56.662 --> 00:09:59.098
AND I REMEMBER VERY CLEARLY MY

00:09:59.165 --> 00:10:00.599
IN WHEN I WAS A LOCAL HEALTH

00:10:00.666 --> 00:10:01.534
OFFICER.

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:02.969
DURING THE RECESSION IN THREE

00:10:03.035 --> 00:10:04.403
YEARS WE HAD FOURTEEN ROUNDS OF

00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:05.638
BUDGET CUTS AND IT DIDN'T TAKE

00:10:05.705 --> 00:10:07.440
MANY ROUNDS TO GET DOWN TO THE

00:10:07.506 --> 00:10:08.607
ACTUAL PEOPLE.

00:10:08.674 --> 00:10:11.377
AND THOSE THAT FUNDING AND MANY

00:10:11.444 --> 00:10:12.812
OF THOSE PEOPLE NEVER CAME BACK.

00:10:12.878 --> 00:10:14.213
AND SO I BELIEVE THAT THE LOSS

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:15.314
OF OUR EXPERIENCE PUBLIC HEALTH

00:10:15.381 --> 00:10:17.516
WORKFORCE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL

00:10:17.583 --> 00:10:18.918
ACTUALLY REPRESENTS A VERY REAL

00:10:18.985 --> 00:10:19.986
THREAT TO THE HEALTH OF

00:10:20.052 --> 00:10:21.320
CALIFORNIA.

00:10:21.387 --> 00:10:23.522

00:10:47.813 --> 00:10:49.482
THAT THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT

THE RISING CASES. TO TO MAINTAIN

00:10:54.387 --> 00:10:55.955
THE CAPABILITY IS NECESSARY TO

DESERVES.

OVERWHELMINGLY THE MONEY THAT WE

00:23:58.036 --> 00:23:58.970
USE PARTICULARLY FOR THE

00:23:59.037 --> 00:24:00.005
FUNCTIONS THAT WE SHARE WITH

00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:07.772
SO AS SOON DOCTOR CHAVEZ POINTED

00:25:07.839 --> 00:25:09.374
OUT POINTED OUT WE'RE VERY GOOD

00:25:09.441 --> 00:25:11.643
AT SMALL SHORT TERM THINGS WE

00:25:11.710 --> 00:25:12.811
BEGIN TO STRUGGLE WHEN IT

00:25:12.878 --> 00:25:15.013
REQUIRES A LONGER TERM.

00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:16.848
REDIRECTION OF STAFF AND WHAT

00:25:16.915 --> 00:25:19.184
ENDS UP HAPPENING IS THE OTHER

00:25:19.251 --> 00:25:20.852
WORKED SIMPLY DOESN'T GET DONE.

00:25:20.919 --> 00:25:23.955
AND AND OR WHAT EVERYONE WHO IS --

00:25:24.022 --> 00:25:25.891
NOT ON AN HOURLY SCHEDULE

00:25:25.957 --> 00:25:27.926
MANAGERS AT CENTER I WORKED VERY

00:25:27.993 --> 00:25:29.361
VERY LONG HOURS TO TRY TO MAKE

00:25:29.427 --> 00:25:30.395
IT WORK --

00:25:30.462 --> 00:25:31.696
I'M VERY PROUD OF THE WORK THAT

00:25:31.763 --> 00:25:33.298
WE DO BUT IT IS A CONSTANT

00:25:33.365 --> 00:25:34.766
STRUGGLE AND I WILL SAY THAT

00:25:34.833 --> 00:25:36.301
THAT VERY SAME STRUGGLE PLACE

00:25:36.368 --> 00:25:36.835
OUT.

00:25:36.902 --> 00:25:38.270
AT THE LOCAL JURISDICTION I

00:25:38.336 --> 00:25:39.070
WOULD ALSO POINT OUT THAT MUCH

00:25:39.137 --> 00:25:41.239
OF THE GENERAL FUND THAT WE

00:25:41.306 --> 00:25:41.907
RECEIVE.

00:25:41.973 --> 00:25:43.308
ALMOST ALL OF IT IS ACTUALLY

00:25:43.375 --> 00:25:45.577
ALSO SIDELOAD LESS THAN 4% OF

00:25:45.644 --> 00:25:46.745
OUR BUDGET IS ACTUALLY FLEXIBLE

00:25:46.811 --> 00:25:47.212
ME[inaudible]

00:25:47.279 --> 00:25:48.813
OKAY.

00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:52.884
AND WHEN YOU SPOKE ABOUT THE THE

00:25:52.951 --> 00:25:54.419
I GUESS THE BLACK IS IT

00:25:54.486 --> 00:25:56.655
BASICALLY STAFF EXPERTISE WHY I

00:25:56.721 --> 00:25:58.723
MEAN BY THAT IS IS THAT IT'S NOT

00:25:58.790 --> 00:25:59.891
THE EXPERTISE OF PEOPLE

00:25:59.958 --> 00:26:01.593
CURRENTLY THERE BUT JUST BE IT'S

00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:02.894
IT'S THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE YOU

00:26:02.961 --> 00:26:03.929
HAVE TO HAVE THE EXPERTISE RIGHT

00:26:03.995 --> 00:26:04.896
IT'S NOT.

00:26:04.963 --> 00:26:06.831
I GUESS WE DON'T WE DON'T HAVE

00:26:06.898 --> 00:26:07.799
WE DON'T WE DON'T HAVE.

00:26:07.866 --> 00:26:10.135
WE'RE NOT PAYING EPIDEMIOLOGISTS

00:26:10.201 --> 00:26:11.536
AND PUBLIC HEALTH NURSES TO SIT

00:26:11.603 --> 00:26:13.738
AROUND WITH THE ALARM THAT GOES

00:26:13.805 --> 00:26:15.507
OFF WHEN IT RIGHT THERE THEY'RE

00:26:15.573 --> 00:26:19.644
DOING EXISTING TASKS.

00:26:19.711 --> 00:26:20.278
WHICH WE COULD ALL RIGHT THIS IS

00:26:20.345 --> 00:26:22.414
A HAS THERE BEEN ASSESSMENT DONE

00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:24.115
IS TO SO WHAT IS THE SHORTFALL I

00:26:24.182 --> 00:26:25.350
MEAN I REALIZE THERE'S OBVIOUSLY

00:26:25.417 --> 00:26:26.284
SOME JUDGMENT TO BE MADE WHAT

00:26:26.351 --> 00:26:27.319
WHAT HOW MANY WHAT IS THE WHAT

00:26:27.385 --> 00:26:28.353
WHAT WOULD BE THE GOAL NUMBER

00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:31.156
BUT IT WHEN YOU SAY WE SO.

00:26:31.222 --> 00:26:31.957
WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO HIRE

00:26:32.023 --> 00:26:34.492
PEOPLE OR WHEN THERE'S --

00:26:34.559 --> 00:26:36.561
EVENTS THAT HAPPENED --

00:26:36.628 --> 00:26:42.634
CAN R. V. LIKE A LITTLE SHORTER

00:26:42.701 --> 00:26:43.835
A LOT SHORTER --

00:26:43.902 --> 00:26:45.236
WHAT FOR SALE LIKE WE COULD USE

00:26:45.303 --> 00:26:47.105
TWICE AS MANY AS WE HAVE NOW OR

00:26:47.172 --> 00:26:48.173
SOME SOME?

00:26:48.239 --> 00:26:50.275
ANALYSTS SAY THAT I DON'T THE I

00:26:50.342 --> 00:26:53.178
THINK THAT FOR SPEAKING FOR CPAS.

00:26:53.244 --> 00:26:55.313
I DON'T THINK THAT OUR SHORTFALL

00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:57.749
IS PARTICULARLY DRAMATIC AYE OUR

00:26:57.816 --> 00:26:59.117
CHALLENGE IS NOT SO MUCH THE

00:26:59.184 --> 00:27:00.518
TOTAL AMOUNT OF FUNDING AS THE

00:27:00.585 --> 00:27:02.287
WAY THE FUNDING COMES TO US. TO

00:27:02.354 --> 00:27:03.955
DO VERY VERY VERY CREATIVE IN

00:27:04.022 --> 00:27:05.790
ORDER TO SEARCH PARTICULAR

00:27:05.857 --> 00:27:07.592
ACTIVITIES WE'VE BEEN VERY

00:27:07.659 --> 00:27:09.461
SUCCESSFUL FOR THAT --

00:27:09.527 --> 00:27:11.863
I WORRY ABOUT THE PANDEMIC THAT

00:27:11.930 --> 00:27:13.431
TAKES TWO YEARS --

00:27:13.498 --> 00:27:15.266
WE WILL WE WILL BURN OUT WE HAVE

00:27:15.333 --> 00:27:16.768
NOT DONE A FORMAL ASSESSMENT OF

00:27:16.835 --> 00:27:18.370
WHAT THAT WOULD LOOK LIKE FULLY

00:27:18.436 --> 00:27:20.205
FLESHED OUT WHERE IT BECOMES

00:27:20.271 --> 00:27:21.973
CRITICAL REALLY IS AT THE LOCAL

00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:23.308
LEVEL AND I'M SURE YOU'LL HEAR

00:27:23.375 --> 00:27:25.510
ABOUT THAT WHEN YOU HAVE. ONE OR

00:27:25.577 --> 00:27:27.078
TWO PUBLIC HEALTH NURSES IT TOOK

00:27:27.145 --> 00:27:29.147
US TWO YEARS TO HIGHER WHEN I

00:27:29.214 --> 00:27:29.748
WAS IN AFFECT PUBLIC HEALTH

00:27:29.814 --> 00:27:31.916
OFFICER TOOK US TWO YEARS TO

00:27:31.983 --> 00:27:33.251
HIRE COMMUNICABLE DISEASE PUBLIC

00:27:33.318 --> 00:27:34.085
HEALTH NURSE.

00:27:34.152 --> 00:27:37.655
BECAUSE THERE ARE SO FEW OF THEM

00:27:37.722 --> 00:27:38.223
OUT THERE --

00:27:38.289 --> 00:27:38.857
AND BECAUSE THEY CAN MAKE MUCH

00:27:38.923 --> 00:27:39.724
MORE MONEY OBVIOUSLY IN THE

00:27:39.791 --> 00:27:40.525
PRIVATE SECTOR.

00:27:40.592 --> 00:27:41.960
SO KEEPING THE PEOPLE THAT

00:27:42.027 --> 00:27:43.361
YOU'VE INVESTED IN THAT YOU'VE

00:27:43.428 --> 00:27:45.096
TRAINED IT IS NOT EASY TO DO A

00:27:45.163 --> 00:27:47.298
CONTACT INVESTIGATION WHETHER

00:27:47.365 --> 00:27:49.000
IT'S FOR TUBERCULOSIS OR

00:27:49.067 --> 00:27:51.236
NOROVIRUS WARS MEASLES.

00:27:51.302 --> 00:27:53.271
AND TO EXPECT US TO BE ABLE TO

00:27:53.338 --> 00:27:55.040
SORT OF JUST GO OUT AND HIRE NEW

00:27:55.106 --> 00:27:56.274
PEOPLE -- IS

00:27:56.341 --> 00:27:57.909
REALLY TAKES ABOUT TWO YEARS TO

00:27:57.976 --> 00:27:59.377
BECOME REALLY PROFICIENT AND

00:27:59.444 --> 00:28:00.678
THAT'S WHY WHAT WE HAVE FOCUSED

00:28:00.745 --> 00:28:02.781
ON DOING IS TRYING TO PROVIDE

00:28:02.847 --> 00:28:04.616
THAT TECHNICAL EXPERTISE.

00:28:04.682 --> 00:28:06.851
AND SUPPORT AS LOCAL HEALTH

00:28:06.918 --> 00:28:08.887
JURISDICTIONS TRY TO TO HANDLE

00:28:08.953 --> 00:28:10.355
THESE ISSUES.

00:28:10.422 --> 00:28:12.090
THE OTHER DISTURBING AYE

00:28:12.157 --> 00:28:15.193
ANECDOTALLY OF THERE COUNTIES

00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:16.895
WHEN DISCUSSING YOU KNOW WHERE

00:28:16.961 --> 00:28:18.129
THEY'RE GOING TO CUT GENERAL

00:28:18.196 --> 00:28:19.497
FUND USUALLY COMMUNICABLE

00:28:19.564 --> 00:28:20.799
DISEASES BECAUSE IT IS LARGELY

00:28:20.865 --> 00:28:22.367
FUNDED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL BY

00:28:22.434 --> 00:28:24.469
COUNTY GENERAL FUND --

00:28:24.536 --> 00:28:25.904
SAY WELL IT'S OKAY BECAUSE IF

00:28:25.970 --> 00:28:27.572
YOU CAN'T RESPOND THE THE STATE

00:28:27.639 --> 00:28:29.874
WILL COME WE DON'T HAVE A A

00:28:29.941 --> 00:28:31.209
WORKFORCE THAT DOES BOOTS ON THE

00:28:31.276 --> 00:28:32.210
GROUND --

00:28:32.277 --> 00:28:34.112
ANSWER THAT JUST HAVING TO DO

00:28:34.179 --> 00:28:35.413
THAT THE SHELTERS FOR A SHORT

00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:36.247
PERIOD OF TIME WHERE TO PULL

00:28:36.314 --> 00:28:37.749
FROM MULTIPLE DIFFERENT PARTS OF

00:28:37.816 --> 00:28:39.584
THE DEPARTMENT. TO IMAGINE THAT

00:28:39.651 --> 00:28:40.952
WE WOULD BE ABLE TO MOBILIZE A

00:28:41.019 --> 00:28:42.220
WORK FORCE TO GO IN AND DO A

00:28:42.287 --> 00:28:44.322
CONTACT AN INVESTIGATION AND IT

00:28:44.389 --> 00:28:45.857
COMMUNITY THAT WE DON'T KNOW.

00:28:45.924 --> 00:28:48.026
IS IT'S JUST NOT REALISTIC AND

00:28:48.093 --> 00:28:49.194
SO -- WE

00:28:49.260 --> 00:28:50.662
REALLY DO NEED THAT LOCAL

00:28:50.728 --> 00:28:53.231
INFRASTRUCTURE TO BE ROBUST

00:28:53.298 --> 00:28:55.033
ENOUGH TO MAINTAIN.

00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:55.700
SO YOU YOU SERVE ANTICIPATE WHAT

00:28:55.767 --> 00:28:56.668
MY NEXT QUESTION WAS WHICH IS

00:28:56.734 --> 00:28:58.269
GOING TO BE IS THAT WHAT WHAT

00:28:58.336 --> 00:28:59.871
HAPPENS IF YOU HAVE A LOCALITY.

00:28:59.938 --> 00:29:00.972
THAT HAS INSUFFICIENT PUBLIC

00:29:01.039 --> 00:29:03.942
HEALTH STAFF TO DEAL WITH A

00:29:04.008 --> 00:29:05.577
PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY AN

00:29:05.643 --> 00:29:08.780
OUTBREAK --

00:29:08.847 --> 00:29:10.081
WELL WHAT DO IT WHAT DO YOU DO.

00:29:10.148 --> 00:29:11.983
ONE THING THAT HAS HAPPENED --

00:29:12.050 --> 00:29:14.819
AND THAT THE THE BOTH --

00:29:14.886 --> 00:29:16.121
THE CALIFORNIA COMFORTS OF LOCAL

00:29:16.187 --> 00:29:17.689
HEALTH OFFICERS AND HEALTH

00:29:17.755 --> 00:29:18.790
OFFICERS ASSOCIATION CHECK HAVE

00:29:18.857 --> 00:29:20.692
BEEN REALLY GOOD ABOUT REACHING

00:29:20.758 --> 00:29:22.393
OUT TO OTHER COUNTIES THE PUBLIC

00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:23.795
HEALTH OFFICER BY THE WAY IS

00:29:23.862 --> 00:29:25.730
MOSTLY ALWAYS ONE PERSON IN A

00:29:25.797 --> 00:29:28.233
SMALL COUNTY AND IT'S EXHAUSTING

00:29:28.299 --> 00:29:29.100
THAT SOMETIMES THEY'RE WORKING

00:29:29.167 --> 00:29:29.968
FOR A MILTON YOU'RE.

00:29:30.034 --> 00:29:31.903
GOING TO HEAR FROM YOU COUNTY

00:29:31.970 --> 00:29:35.173
ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCE AND SO

00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:37.942
OTHER HEALTH OFFICERS WE SHIPS

00:29:38.009 --> 00:29:39.511
FOR THEM WORK FOR SEVERAL DAYS

00:29:39.577 --> 00:29:40.812
IN A ROW AND HELP OUT.

00:29:40.879 --> 00:29:42.080
I'M THAT KIND OF MUTUAL AID IS

00:29:42.147 --> 00:29:43.581
AT THIS POINT RELATIVELY

00:29:43.648 --> 00:29:44.949
INFORMAL.

00:29:45.016 --> 00:29:46.985
BUT IN A IN A LARGE EVIDENT

00:29:47.051 --> 00:29:48.887
WE'RE WE'RE PRETTY ROBUST IN

00:29:48.953 --> 00:29:50.421
TERMS OF EPIDEMIOLOGY CAPACITY

00:29:50.488 --> 00:29:51.689
AT THE DEPARTMENT.

00:29:51.756 --> 00:29:53.458
SO I DON'T FORESEE A

00:29:53.525 --> 00:29:54.893
CIRCUMSTANCE --

00:29:54.959 --> 00:29:56.461
WHERE WE'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO

00:29:56.528 --> 00:29:57.729
PROVIDE THAT KIND OF TECHNICAL

00:29:57.795 --> 00:29:59.330
ASSISTANCE BUT BOOTS ON THE

00:29:59.397 --> 00:30:00.598
GROUND IT'S GOING TO BE

00:30:00.665 --> 00:30:01.733
BORROWING FROM EACH OTHER AND

00:30:01.799 --> 00:30:03.401
POTENTIALLY AS HAS HAPPENED IN

00:30:03.468 --> 00:30:05.236
NATURAL DISASTERS BORROWING FROM

00:30:05.303 --> 00:30:06.371
OTHER STATES?

00:30:06.437 --> 00:30:08.173
PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY KNOW HOW TO

00:30:08.239 --> 00:30:09.374
DO THE TECHNICAL PARTS

00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:11.176
PARTICULAR COMMUNICABLE DISEASE

00:30:11.242 --> 00:30:13.645
CONTROL AND I WOULD HATE TO SEE

00:30:13.711 --> 00:30:15.380
THIS HAVE TO DO THAT FRANKLY.

00:30:15.446 --> 00:30:19.584
AS SERVER SO

00:30:19.651 --> 00:30:20.485
YES PLEASE PLEASE YES ASSEMBLY.

00:30:20.552 --> 00:30:21.719
SO COULD YOU GO BACK TO WHAT YOU

00:30:21.786 --> 00:30:22.787
SAID ABOUT IT'S NOT THE FUNDING

00:30:22.854 --> 00:30:23.922
IT'S THE WAY YOU RECEIVE IT.

00:30:23.988 --> 00:30:25.590
RIGHT SO I'M SPEAKING OUT FOR

00:30:25.657 --> 00:30:26.658
THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH

00:30:26.724 --> 00:30:30.228
OKAY LEVEL WE GOT WE HAVE OVER

00:30:30.295 --> 00:30:30.795
TWO HUNDRED SEPARATE FUNDING

00:30:30.862 --> 00:30:33.565
STREAMS ALMOST EVERY ONE OF THEM

00:30:33.631 --> 00:30:36.534
IS DISEASE OR CONDITION SPECIFIC.

00:30:36.601 --> 00:30:37.769
AND SO IF YOU HAVE TO DIABETES

00:30:37.835 --> 00:30:39.270
FUNDING YOU MAY HAVE AN

00:30:39.337 --> 00:30:40.672
EPIDEMIOLOGIST TO DO THAT.

00:30:40.738 --> 00:30:42.240
BUT THAT'S ALL THAT PERSON CAN

00:30:42.307 --> 00:30:43.641
WORK ON EXCEPT FOR THAT

00:30:43.708 --> 00:30:47.579
FEDERALLY ALLOWABLE 5% FOR

00:30:47.645 --> 00:30:49.781
EMERGENCIES OR DISASTERS.

00:30:49.847 --> 00:30:51.015
SO HOW DO YOU SUGGEST WE MAKE

00:30:51.082 --> 00:30:54.552
THAT BETTER FOR YOU.

00:30:54.619 --> 00:30:55.720
IT BUT I LIKE I WAS GOING

00:30:55.787 --> 00:30:56.487
CONVERSATION OKAY FEDERAL

00:30:56.554 --> 00:30:57.855
GOVERNMENT ON FRANKLY OKAY I I

00:30:57.922 --> 00:31:00.058
ALSO I DO THINK THOUGH THAT

00:31:00.124 --> 00:31:01.759
THERE IS A ROLE --

00:31:01.826 --> 00:31:04.295
FOR FOR STATE FUNDING TO KIND OF

00:31:04.362 --> 00:31:05.830
BRIDGE GAPS --

00:31:05.897 --> 00:31:07.198
POTENTIAL A BUT THAT'S NOT

00:31:07.265 --> 00:31:08.733
SOMETHING WE LOOKED INTO AND AT

00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:11.469
ANY ANY IN ANY DETAIL.

00:31:11.536 --> 00:31:15.206
IF YOU COMPARE THE DEGREE OF LOW

00:31:15.273 --> 00:31:16.207
IT GOES INTO LOCAL HEALTH

00:31:16.274 --> 00:31:17.308
DEPARTMENTS WITH THE AMOUNT OF

00:31:17.375 --> 00:31:18.810
STATE GENERAL FUND THAT COMES.

00:31:18.876 --> 00:31:20.478
TO THE STATE HEALTH DEPARTMENT

00:31:20.545 --> 00:31:20.979
YOU'LL SEE THEY'RE VERY

00:31:21.045 --> 00:31:23.615
DIFFERENT.

00:31:23.681 --> 00:31:24.215
THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER US

00:31:24.282 --> 00:31:27.218
CHAIR -- SO

00:31:27.285 --> 00:31:30.288
ACTUALLY THE IT.

00:31:30.355 --> 00:31:31.923
I ALSO WANT TO SO IN TERMS SO

00:31:31.990 --> 00:31:33.558
ACTUALLY THIS IS THERE BEEN SOME

00:31:33.625 --> 00:31:35.326
CONVERSATIONS --

00:31:35.393 --> 00:31:36.127
AND AND WE SERVE HAVE YOUR

00:31:36.194 --> 00:31:37.629
SEPARATE PANELS AND I'M VERY

00:31:37.695 --> 00:31:39.464
MUCH LOOKING FORWARD TO HEARING

00:31:39.530 --> 00:31:39.931
FROM THE LOCAL HEALTH

00:31:39.998 --> 00:31:40.898
DEPARTMENTS.

00:31:40.965 --> 00:31:42.066
TO THAT IS YOUR BEEN SOME

00:31:42.133 --> 00:31:45.403
CONVERSATION ABOUT A MUTUAL AID

00:31:45.470 --> 00:31:47.005
SYSTEM LIKE THE FIRE DEPARTMENTS

00:31:47.071 --> 00:31:48.339
HAVE --

00:31:48.406 --> 00:31:49.507
WHERE WE TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW

00:31:49.574 --> 00:31:51.676
WE -- BUILD

00:31:51.743 --> 00:31:53.177
UP SOME.

00:31:53.244 --> 00:31:53.978
I REALIZE THAT REQUIRES SOME

00:31:54.045 --> 00:31:56.180
RESOURCES BUT BUILD UP SOME

00:31:56.247 --> 00:31:58.616
BASICALLY SOME EXTRA CAPACITY

00:31:58.683 --> 00:32:02.420
AND CERTAIN LOCALITIES TO TRY.

00:32:02.487 --> 00:32:03.054
TO TAKE THAT ONE OKAY HEARD OF

00:32:03.121 --> 00:32:03.554
US ABOUT HOW THE MEDICAL

00:32:03.621 --> 00:32:05.223
RESPONSE STRUCTURE AND IN FACT

00:32:05.290 --> 00:32:06.557
WE DO HAVE A AND RIVERSIDE

00:32:06.624 --> 00:32:07.659
COUNTIES HERE AND I KNOW THAT

00:32:07.725 --> 00:32:09.260
THEY ARE ONE OF THE COUNTIES

00:32:09.327 --> 00:32:10.595
THAT REALLY JUMPS AND THAT WITH

00:32:10.662 --> 00:32:12.363
MUTUAL AID --

00:32:12.430 --> 00:32:13.665
ASSISTANCE AND SO.

00:32:13.731 --> 00:32:15.300
PART OF THE SYSTEM THAT WE'VE

00:32:15.366 --> 00:32:17.302
BUILT IS TO ALLOW WITHIN EACH

00:32:17.368 --> 00:32:19.337
REGION COUNTIES TO WORK TOGETHER

00:32:19.404 --> 00:32:21.272
TO USE EACH OTHER'S RESOURCES

00:32:21.339 --> 00:32:22.640
AND AND SOME --

00:32:22.707 --> 00:32:24.208
REGIONS WE'VE AND DO HAVE

00:32:24.275 --> 00:32:26.744
AGREEMENT SOMEHOW THEY WILL PAY

00:32:26.811 --> 00:32:27.512
ONE ANOTHER WHEN THEY COME IN

00:32:27.578 --> 00:32:28.446
BUT IT IS.

00:32:28.513 --> 00:32:29.814
A FOR FOR A LONGER EVENT IT DOES

00:32:29.881 --> 00:32:31.916
REQUIRE DOLLARS BETWEEN.

00:32:31.983 --> 00:32:37.755
SO I I GUESS MY NEXT QUESTION IS

00:32:37.822 --> 00:32:39.123
FIFTH TALKED ABOUT THE NEED TO

00:32:39.190 --> 00:32:40.625
SHORE UP THE MUTUAL AID SYSTEM

00:32:40.692 --> 00:32:42.794
BECAUSE THE QUESTION IS HOW MUCH

00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:44.095
EXCESS COULD PASS.

00:32:44.162 --> 00:32:45.029
RIGHT NOT THE RIGHT WORD RIGHT

00:32:45.096 --> 00:32:46.531
BUT I MEAN HOW MUCH CAPACITY IS

00:32:46.597 --> 00:32:47.532
THERE.

00:32:47.598 --> 00:32:48.499
YOU CAN HAVE A MUTUAL AID SYSTEM

00:32:48.566 --> 00:32:50.868
THAT IS OF VERY LITTLE CAPACITY

00:32:50.935 --> 00:32:52.804
TO MOVE AROUND I MEAN IT HELPS A

00:32:52.870 --> 00:32:56.174
LITTLE BIT YEAH SO HOW MUCH SO

00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:57.675
ANSWERS ESTIMATE ABOUT HOW MUCH.

00:32:57.742 --> 00:33:00.178
CAPACITY THAT V. L. OBVIOUS YEAH

00:33:00.244 --> 00:33:01.713
WE WE ALSO SAY I DON'T KNOW WHAT

00:33:01.779 --> 00:33:02.980
OUTBREAK WILL HAPPEN EVERY YEAR

00:33:03.047 --> 00:33:05.483
BUT THIS YOU KNOW BETTER AND I I

00:33:05.550 --> 00:33:06.117
CAN ALWAYS COUNT ON AT LEAST ONE

00:33:06.184 --> 00:33:08.453
OR TWO THAT SIGNIFICANT ONES

00:33:08.519 --> 00:33:11.189
NEARBY Là SMALLER ONES AS AS AS

00:33:11.255 --> 00:33:12.657
AS AS PRESENTED EARLIER BUT I WE

00:33:12.724 --> 00:33:12.890
SHOULD.

00:33:12.957 --> 00:33:16.928
BE THINKING ABOUT WHAT LEVEL OF

00:33:16.994 --> 00:33:18.696
THE PASSAGE WE HAVE OUT THERE

00:33:18.763 --> 00:33:19.030
THAT PERHAPS.

00:33:19.097 --> 00:33:19.530
YOU KNOW THAT COULD BE

00:33:19.597 --> 00:33:20.264
DISTRIBUTED ACROSS DIFFERENT

00:33:20.331 --> 00:33:22.767
COUNTIES FOR YOU TO TO TO TO BE

00:33:22.834 --> 00:33:24.202
SURE TO USE THAT VOTE WHAT

00:33:24.268 --> 00:33:24.936
BASICALLY WHAT THE MINIMUM

00:33:25.002 --> 00:33:26.537
CAPACITY WE SHOULD HAVE TO OUR

00:33:26.604 --> 00:33:28.106
MUTUAL AID SAYS. SEVEN SOME

00:33:28.172 --> 00:33:29.540
ASSESSMENT OF THAT.

00:33:29.607 --> 00:33:30.541
THERE HASN'T FORMALLY THERE IS

00:33:30.608 --> 00:33:32.143
THERE A COUPLE OF AREAS WHERE

00:33:32.210 --> 00:33:33.544
THEY'RE ACTUALLY HAVE BEEN.

00:33:33.611 --> 00:33:34.278
WELL WHEN AREA WHERE WE'VE

00:33:34.345 --> 00:33:35.146
ACTUALLY MADE A FAIR AMOUNT OF

00:33:35.213 --> 00:33:36.114
PROGRESS AND THAT'S THE

00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:37.815
LABORATORY CAPACITY BECAUSE IN

00:33:37.882 --> 00:33:39.217
OUTBREAKS THOSE HAVE TO SEARCH.

00:33:39.283 --> 00:33:41.986
AND IN HISTORICALLY IT WAS ONE

00:33:42.053 --> 00:33:43.921
ONE COUNTY ONE LABORATORY AND

00:33:43.988 --> 00:33:44.822
THAT'S JUST IT'S WITH NEW

00:33:44.889 --> 00:33:45.957
LABORATORY TECHNOLOGY NOT

00:33:46.023 --> 00:33:47.058
FEASIBLE --

00:33:47.125 --> 00:33:47.925
AND SO THERE ARE SEVERAL

00:33:47.992 --> 00:33:49.327
DIFFERENT MODELS OF REGIONAL

00:33:49.394 --> 00:33:51.329
LABORATORIES IN CALIFORNIA AND

00:33:51.396 --> 00:33:53.030
SOME OF WHICH ARE VERY --

00:33:53.097 --> 00:33:57.935
VERY SUCCESSFUL TYPES OF SUMMER

00:33:58.002 --> 00:33:59.804
GPA IS SOME ARE --

00:33:59.871 --> 00:34:02.173
CONTRACT IS AND ONE THAT'S A

00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:02.974
THAT'S ACTUALLYWE'VE BEEN.

00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:04.475
LOOKING AT THOUGHT MORE

00:34:04.542 --> 00:34:06.344
CONSISTENTLY TO SEE BECAUSE OURS

00:34:06.411 --> 00:34:07.779
COUNTIES DETERMINED THAT.

00:34:07.845 --> 00:34:09.680
IT MAY NOT BE FEASIBLE FOR THEM

00:34:09.747 --> 00:34:10.882
TO MAINTAIN THEIR PUBLIC HEALTH

00:34:10.948 --> 00:34:11.883
ARE THEY DO HAVE CERTAIN

00:34:11.949 --> 00:34:13.284
CAPACITIES THAT THEY MUST

00:34:13.351 --> 00:34:14.485
MAINTAIN.

00:34:14.552 --> 00:34:16.287
HOW DO WE MAKE THAT POSSIBLE AND

00:34:16.354 --> 00:34:18.289
SO THAT'S AN AREA THAT WE HAVE

00:34:18.356 --> 00:34:20.758
HAD CONVERSATIONS INTERMITTENTLY

00:34:20.825 --> 00:34:22.527
IN THE PAST AROUND?

00:34:22.593 --> 00:34:23.327
COULD WE DO SOMETHING SIMILAR

00:34:23.394 --> 00:34:25.029
WITH EPIDEMIOLOGY CAPACITY

00:34:25.096 --> 00:34:27.064
REGIONAL AS IT WE EVERY TIME

00:34:27.131 --> 00:34:28.266
THAT WE'VE HAD STARTED THOSE

00:34:28.332 --> 00:34:29.600
CONVERSATIONS I HAVE NOT BEEN AT

00:34:29.667 --> 00:34:30.735
THE STATE DURING THAT

00:34:30.802 --> 00:34:32.170
CONVERSATION BUT AS A LOCAL --

00:34:32.236 --> 00:34:34.138
WE RUN INTO CHALLENGES WITH HOW

00:34:34.205 --> 00:34:35.540
IS IT PAID FOR BECAUSE THE

00:34:35.606 --> 00:34:37.675
FUNDING. FOR MANY OF THOSE

00:34:37.742 --> 00:34:38.910
ACTIVITIES COMES FROM FEDERAL

00:34:38.976 --> 00:34:40.578
GOVERNMENT GOES DOWN FROM US TO

00:34:40.645 --> 00:34:42.580
COUNTIES WE HAVEN'T WE NEED TO

00:34:42.647 --> 00:34:44.348
BE MORE CREATIVE AND IN HOW WE

00:34:44.415 --> 00:34:46.117
CAN FIND AN ENTITY THAT DOESN'T

00:34:46.184 --> 00:34:47.819
ACTUALLY LEGALLY EXIST LIKE A

00:34:47.885 --> 00:34:49.086
COLLABORATIVE.

00:34:49.153 --> 00:34:51.122
AND SO THAT I THINK IS BUT I

00:34:51.189 --> 00:34:52.623
ALSO THINK THERE'S AN APPETITE

00:34:52.690 --> 00:34:56.360
FOR THOSE CONVERSATIONS OVER

00:34:56.427 --> 00:34:59.163
TIME.

00:34:59.230 --> 00:35:01.032
SO DO YOU A THE CITY HAVEN'T

00:35:01.098 --> 00:35:01.966
PERFORMED ANY SUCH ASSESSMENT IS

00:35:02.033 --> 00:35:02.467
THAT SOMETHING THAT THE

00:35:02.533 --> 00:35:03.401
DEPARTMENT MIGHT WANT TO

00:35:03.468 --> 00:35:04.669
CONSIDER DOING.

00:35:04.735 --> 00:35:06.504
I THINK THAT I AT THE VERY LEAST

00:35:06.571 --> 00:35:08.439
WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT WHAT WHAT

00:35:08.506 --> 00:35:08.906
WOULD --

00:35:08.973 --> 00:35:10.007
WHAT ARE THE CAPACITIES WERE

00:35:10.074 --> 00:35:11.542
TALKING ABOUT THAT WE WOULD WANT

00:35:11.609 --> 00:35:13.578
TO MAKE SURE WERE PRESENT IN A

00:35:13.644 --> 00:35:14.679
CERTAIN RIGHT THE PAST YOU FOR

00:35:14.745 --> 00:35:16.614
PARTICULAR SPECIFICALLY FOR

00:35:16.681 --> 00:35:17.381
RESPONSE --

00:35:17.448 --> 00:35:19.517
TO AN EVENT.

00:35:19.584 --> 00:35:21.385
AND I THINK THAT MULTIPLE.

00:35:21.452 --> 00:35:23.921
MULTIPLE IS YES WHICH IS TO OUR

00:35:23.988 --> 00:35:25.356
OUR NEW NORM ACTUALLY SO --

00:35:25.423 --> 00:35:26.324
THAT IS ACTUALLY THAT SOMETHING

00:35:26.390 --> 00:35:27.191
I CAN TAKE BACK TO THE CAL FOR

00:35:27.258 --> 00:35:28.459
COMFORT OF LOCAL HEALTH OFFICERS

00:35:28.526 --> 00:35:30.361
WHICH IS OUR ADVISORY BODY ON

00:35:30.428 --> 00:35:32.697
THESE ISSUES AND SEE IF THEY

00:35:32.763 --> 00:35:33.197
WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THAT

00:35:33.264 --> 00:35:34.999
CONVERSATION --

00:35:35.066 --> 00:35:36.968
OUT WHAT ARE THE PARAMETERS AND

00:35:37.034 --> 00:35:37.535
THEN -- WHAT

00:35:37.602 --> 00:35:39.303
THAT WOULD LOOK LIKE BUT I THINK

00:35:39.370 --> 00:35:40.938
THAT IT'S IT IS A DURABLE

00:35:41.005 --> 00:35:42.840
CONVERSATION WELL I I WOULD TO

00:35:42.907 --> 00:35:44.775
AND WILL HAVE THE LOCAL HEALTH

00:35:44.842 --> 00:35:45.376
AUSTRALIA MAY INNER CITY THE

00:35:45.443 --> 00:35:46.244
AUDIENCE RIGHT NOW I WOULD

00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:48.813
SUGGEST THAT MIGHT BE SOMETHING

00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:50.681
TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT TO

00:35:50.748 --> 00:35:51.916
NOT ONLY A CONVERSATION?

00:35:51.983 --> 00:35:53.751
SO THIS WAY CERTAINLY HERE AT

00:35:53.818 --> 00:35:55.186
THE LEGISLATURE WE DEPEND ON

00:35:55.253 --> 00:35:56.821
YOUR EXPERTISE YOU KNOW YOUR

00:35:56.888 --> 00:35:57.922
EXPERTISE AT THE STATE

00:35:57.989 --> 00:35:59.156
DEPARTMENT THE EXPERTISE OF THE

00:35:59.223 --> 00:36:00.658
LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS.

00:36:00.725 --> 00:36:03.027
WE NEED YOU TO COME TO US AND

00:36:03.094 --> 00:36:03.761
SAY THIS IS WHAT WE NEED. TO

00:36:03.828 --> 00:36:06.063
KEEP PEOPLE SAFE.

00:36:06.130 --> 00:36:07.832
I CAN TRY TO GUESS I CAN TRY SAY

00:36:07.899 --> 00:36:09.667
I WANT TO OFFER SOMETHING BUT

00:36:09.734 --> 00:36:11.202
AND I KNOW IT'S NOT THIS REALLY

00:36:11.269 --> 00:36:13.504
EASY BUT WE NEED YOU TO TELL US

00:36:13.571 --> 00:36:14.405
WHAT YOU NEED.

00:36:14.472 --> 00:36:15.573
YEAH WE GOT THE BALLOT SET OFF

00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:17.041
AGAINST A LOT OF OTHER THINGS

00:36:17.108 --> 00:36:18.776
BUT IF I DON'T HAVE SOMETHING IN

00:36:18.843 --> 00:36:20.344
FRONT OF ME TO SAY WELL THIS IS

00:36:20.411 --> 00:36:21.946
WHAT OUR HEALTH OFFICER SAID.

00:36:22.013 --> 00:36:23.180
THIS IS WHAT WE NEED THIS IS

00:36:23.247 --> 00:36:24.515
WHAT WE CAN BE ABLE TO DO WITH

00:36:24.582 --> 00:36:26.350
THAT RESOURCE WE HAVE THIS IS

00:36:26.417 --> 00:36:28.019
WHAT HAPPENED WE DON'T HAVE THEM.

00:36:28.085 --> 00:36:31.088
IT'S HARD FOR ME TO HELP YOU

00:36:31.155 --> 00:36:32.423
HELP ME OUT THAT YOU NEED I NEED

00:36:32.490 --> 00:36:34.125
YOU TO HELP ME HELP YOU SO WE

00:36:34.191 --> 00:36:35.593
CAN HELP THE PEOPLE CALIFORNIA

00:36:35.660 --> 00:36:36.894
SO I WOULD SUGGEST HAVING A

00:36:36.961 --> 00:36:38.596
CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT.

00:36:38.663 --> 00:36:42.066
YOU NEED.

00:36:42.133 --> 00:36:43.568
SO THAT WE CAN --

00:36:43.634 --> 00:36:46.337
THE BILL TO DO OUR JOBS 8% AT

00:36:46.404 --> 00:36:47.805
THE END THE LEGISLATURE --

00:36:47.872 --> 00:36:49.040
CAN DO THAT.

00:36:49.106 --> 00:36:51.909
THANK YOU ALL RIGHT I APPRECIATE

00:36:51.976 --> 00:36:54.145
THAT I I APPRECIATE YOU PERCENT

00:36:54.211 --> 00:36:57.982
ABOUT H. ONE AND ONE BECAUSE IN

00:36:58.049 --> 00:36:59.817
OUT A ROOMMATE THAT YOU THAT WAS

00:36:59.884 --> 00:37:00.484
WHICH HERE AGAIN WAS THAT.

00:37:00.551 --> 00:37:02.653
THE NINE TWO THOUSAND AND NINE

00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:04.689
AND I A REMEMBER --

00:37:04.755 --> 00:37:08.960
AT THAT THE WHO'S HERE SECOND

00:37:09.026 --> 00:37:09.760
OKAY AT THE TIME I WAS NOT THE

00:37:09.827 --> 00:37:11.629
LEGISLATURE I WAS VERY INVOLVED

00:37:11.696 --> 00:37:13.664
IN THAT MEDICAL ASSOCIATION AND

00:37:13.731 --> 00:37:14.932
I REMEMBER HAVING A CONVERSATION

00:37:14.999 --> 00:37:16.467
WITH THE THEN PUBLIC HEALTH

00:37:16.534 --> 00:37:17.201
OFFICER.

00:37:17.268 --> 00:37:18.936
I DON'T WILL GET ANYBODY IN

BUSY DOING OTHER STUFF AND WEAK

00:38:27.905 --> 00:38:29.540

PEOPLE AT THE STATE WHO CAN STEP

00:38:31.108 --> 00:38:31.676
IN WHEN.

00:38:31.742 --> 00:38:33.644
THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE CUT

00:38:33.711 --> 00:38:34.945
THEIR PUBLIC HEALTH STAFF RIGHT

00:38:35.012 --> 00:38:36.480
AND AND THAT'S A PARTICULARLY

00:38:36.547 --> 00:38:38.049
APT -- ISSUE

00:38:38.115 --> 00:38:39.784
BECAUSE I CAN REMEMBER AS A

00:38:39.850 --> 00:38:42.219
LOCAL HEALTH OFFICER SEC HAVING

00:38:42.286 --> 00:38:44.221

MUSICIANS STAFF WHEN THE

00:38:45.790 --> 00:38:47.692
ARGUMENT AS WELL THEY CAN GET IT

00:38:47.758 --> 00:38:48.125
PEOPLE CAN GET THEIR

00:38:48.192 --> 00:38:49.493
IMMUNIZATIONS AT HEALTHCARE

00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:51.028
FACILITIES PRIMARY CARE CLINICS

00:38:51.095 --> 00:38:52.863
FQHCS.

00:38:52.930 --> 00:38:55.066
BUT FQHCS WORK AND WORK AT A

00:38:55.132 --> 00:38:57.101
MAXIMUM CAPACITY THEY HAVE NO

00:38:57.168 --> 00:39:00.304
SURGE CAPACITY IF WE LOSE PUBLIC

00:39:00.371 --> 00:39:01.539
HEALTH'S ABILITY TO SEARCH.

00:39:01.605 --> 00:39:03.040
THEN WE ARE REALLY GOING TO HAVE

00:39:03.107 --> 00:39:04.008
A PROBLEM IF WE NEED TO

00:39:04.075 --> 00:39:05.943
VACCINATE PEOPLE OR DISTRIBUTE

00:39:06.010 --> 00:39:07.445
PILLS OR YOU KNOW WHATEVER IT

00:39:07.511 --> 00:39:08.612
COMES.

00:39:08.679 --> 00:39:09.914
TO THERE ARE WAYS TO WORK AROUND

00:39:09.980 --> 00:39:11.382
BUT WE DON'T WANT TO BE MAKING

00:39:11.449 --> 00:39:13.150
IT UP AT THE LAST MINUTE.

00:39:13.217 --> 00:39:14.318
SALINAS IS OPPOSED BECAUSE YOU

00:39:14.385 --> 00:39:15.720
MENTIONED THAT PEOPLE SAID WELL

00:39:15.786 --> 00:39:17.254
YOU CAN THEY CAN GET IN OTHER

00:39:17.321 --> 00:39:19.123
PLACES SO WHAT IS THIS.

00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:20.057
WE TALK ABOUT SERGIO PASS THE I

00:39:20.124 --> 00:39:20.925
KNOW WE MAINLY TALK ABOUT

00:39:20.991 --> 00:39:23.094
GOVERNMENTAL ENTITY STATE LOCAL

00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:25.463
FEDERAL BUT WHAT IS IT MEAN TO

00:39:25.529 --> 00:39:26.197
WHAT DEGREE.

00:39:26.263 --> 00:39:32.603
THE DOES THE PRIVATE SECTOR

00:39:32.670 --> 00:39:34.505
RULES AND CLINIC.

00:39:34.572 --> 00:39:38.442
AND SO WHAT BETWEEN IT AND THE

00:39:38.509 --> 00:39:39.877
PUBLIC HEALTH SIDE BETWEEN.

00:39:39.944 --> 00:39:41.746
HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND PRIVATE

00:39:41.812 --> 00:39:43.414
ENTITIES ESSENTIALLY AND THEIR

00:39:43.481 --> 00:39:45.116
ROLE AND AND HELPING OUT WITH

00:39:45.182 --> 00:39:50.121
SURGERY OTHER TYPES OF THINGS.

00:39:50.187 --> 00:39:51.555
SO WE WE DO HAVE A ROOM A

00:39:51.622 --> 00:39:53.591
VOLUNTEER SYSTEM AND WE HAVE A

00:39:53.657 --> 00:39:54.959
SERIES OF MEDICAL RESERVE COURSE

00:39:55.025 --> 00:39:57.161
AT THE LOCAL LEVEL ON WHO CAN

00:39:57.228 --> 00:39:59.196
STEP AND THEY TRAIN BUT IT'S

00:39:59.263 --> 00:40:01.632
ALSO WE'RE THEY ALL HAVE JOBS.

00:40:01.699 --> 00:40:02.933
TO RIGHT AND SO IF IT'S A

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:05.603
SITUATION WHERE THE MEDICAL SIDE

00:40:05.669 --> 00:40:07.204
IS ALSO IMPACT IT WHERE THEY'RE

00:40:07.271 --> 00:40:08.472
GOING TO BE NEEDED IN THEIR

00:40:08.539 --> 00:40:10.207
HOSPITALS OR THEIR CLINICS YOUR

00:40:10.274 --> 00:40:11.842
WORK SORT OF ROBBING PETER TO

00:40:11.909 --> 00:40:12.810
PAY PAUL --

00:40:12.877 --> 00:40:14.345
AND SO ALTHOUGH WE DO TRAIN

00:40:14.411 --> 00:40:16.080
PEOPLE AND FOR SMALLER AMOUNTS

00:40:16.147 --> 00:40:19.083
AND SHORTER EVENTS I THINK YOU

00:40:19.150 --> 00:40:21.719
KNOW LIKE AT THE BUTTE COUNTY --

00:40:21.786 --> 00:40:22.553
SHELTERS WHERE MANY.

00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:23.954
PEOPLE DID VOLUNTEER NOT ONLY

00:40:24.021 --> 00:40:24.922
THEM ARE SEES BUT HEALTHCARE

00:40:24.989 --> 00:40:26.757
INDUSTRY BROUGHT PEOPLE TO THE

00:40:26.824 --> 00:40:28.859
TABLE IN A SMALL OF AN TO SHORT

00:40:28.926 --> 00:40:31.295
TERM EVENT THAT IS THERE AND CAN

00:40:31.362 --> 00:40:32.530
BE HELPFUL.

00:40:32.596 --> 00:40:34.532
BUT I THINK WHEN LAST AND IF

00:40:34.598 --> 00:40:35.132
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT BRINGING

00:40:35.199 --> 00:40:37.134
PEOPLE INTO HEALTHCARE AND

00:40:37.201 --> 00:40:38.569
SURGING THERE IT'S DIFFICULT

00:40:38.636 --> 00:40:39.904
WITH A LOT OF RULES ABOUT WHO

00:40:39.970 --> 00:40:41.338
CAN AND CAN'T COME INTO

00:40:41.405 --> 00:40:42.907
HEALTHCARE FACILITIES DO YOU.

00:40:42.973 --> 00:40:45.576
PRACTICE BUT IT'S PRETTY LIKELY

00:40:45.643 --> 00:40:47.411
THAT IN ANY EVENT LIKE PAN BIKE

00:40:47.478 --> 00:40:48.612
A PANDEMIC THE HEALTH CARE

00:40:48.679 --> 00:40:49.713
INDUSTRY IS NOT GOING TO HAVE A

00:40:49.780 --> 00:40:51.048
LOT OF BAND WITH BECAUSE THEY'RE

00:40:51.115 --> 00:40:52.016
GOING TO BE TAKING CARE OF THEIR

00:40:52.082 --> 00:40:53.350
OWN PATIENTS.

00:40:53.417 --> 00:40:55.019
THERE IS SINCE EACH ONE AND WHEN

00:40:55.085 --> 00:40:56.453
THERE'S A NEW PHENOMENON WELL

00:40:56.520 --> 00:40:57.087
NEW AS OF THAT IF YOU'VE BEEN

00:40:57.154 --> 00:40:58.155
AROUND AS LONG AS I HAVE WHICH

00:40:58.222 --> 00:41:00.024
IS THERE ARE PRIVATE COMPANIES

00:41:00.090 --> 00:41:01.492
THAT DO SPECIFICALLY MASS

00:41:01.559 --> 00:41:03.260
VACCINATION SO THEY HAVE LARGE

00:41:03.327 --> 00:41:05.129
CADRES OF NURSES WHO WORK FOR

00:41:05.196 --> 00:41:05.729
THEM THAT CAN GO ANYWHERE.

00:41:05.796 --> 00:41:07.331
IN THE STATE THE THING IS YOU

00:41:07.398 --> 00:41:09.266
HAVE TO HAVE THE RESOURCES TO TO

00:41:09.333 --> 00:41:11.468
HIRE THEM TO COME IN.

00:41:11.535 --> 00:41:16.874
BUT I HAVE DON'T HAVE ANY

00:41:16.941 --> 00:41:19.543
EXPERIENCE WITH ACTUALLY.

00:41:19.610 --> 00:41:20.578
OKAY.

00:41:20.644 --> 00:41:22.413
AND ACTUALLY --

00:41:22.479 --> 00:41:24.348
AT OUR CHAVEZ AID --

00:41:24.415 --> 00:41:25.516

00:41:25.583 --> 00:41:27.218
INCREASING NUMBER OF REPORTS

ACTUALLY.

00:41:39.230 --> 00:41:40.030
YES THEY SAID YOU KNOW FIRST

00:41:40.097 --> 00:41:41.799
THOSE REPORTS FIRST COME TO THE

00:41:41.866 --> 00:41:42.933
LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT RIGHT

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:45.069
THEY DO HAVE TO REVIEW EVERYONE

00:41:45.135 --> 00:41:47.304
OF THEM AND FREQUENTLY RESPOND

00:41:47.371 --> 00:41:48.839
TO WHAT THEY FIND.

00:41:48.906 --> 00:41:52.710
AND NOT HAVE THEY JUST NOT HADAN INCREASE BUT AS YOU HEARD

00:41:52.776 --> 00:41:53.844
ALMOST EVERYONE OF THEM HAS HAD

00:41:53.911 --> 00:41:56.814
A DECREASING PERSONNEL SO.

00:41:56.881 --> 00:41:58.816
I FREQUENTLY THAT TASK TAKES A

00:41:58.883 --> 00:42:00.718
BIG PART OF THEIR STOPPING JUST

00:42:00.784 --> 00:42:02.987
MAINTAINING WITH THE INCREASING

00:42:03.053 --> 00:42:04.321

PEOPLE ANYWHERE HAVING DELAYS

00:42:10.194 --> 00:42:12.463
THAT WE ARE DOING THAT I THINK

00:42:12.529 --> 00:42:13.831
IT'S BEEN HELPFUL HIS IS

00:42:13.898 --> 00:42:15.399
LEVERAGING IT TECHNOLOGIES SO

00:42:15.466 --> 00:42:17.801
THAT WE CAN AUTOMATE AS MUCH OF

00:42:17.868 --> 00:42:19.503

TO ACCOMPLISH THIS TASK SO OUR

00:43:12.790 --> 00:43:14.992
FIRST -- A

00:43:15.059 --> 00:43:16.961
PLAN TO GET TO THE POINT WHERE

00:43:28.038 --> 00:43:29.273
PASSIVE REPORTING OF THAT TIME

00:43:29.340 --> 00:43:31.875
IS MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE THAN

00:43:31.942 --> 00:43:32.710
EXPECTING PHYSICIANS ENTER DATA.

00:43:32.776 --> 00:43:34.378
RIGHT NOW WE'RE BUILDING THE COR

00:43:34.445 --> 00:43:36.080
CAPACITY FOR THAT AND WE'RE

00:43:36.146 --> 00:43:37.214
BUILDING IN OUR OPERABILITY

00:43:37.281 --> 00:43:38.282
WITHIN OUR MANY DISEASE

00:43:38.349 --> 00:43:39.783
REGISTRIES BECAUSE SOME OF

00:43:39.850 --> 00:43:41.018
THAT'S ALREADY HAPPENING IN

00:43:41.085 --> 00:43:42.319
PUTTING GOING INTO THESE

00:43:42.386 --> 00:43:43.153
LEGACIES.

00:43:43.220 --> 00:43:45.756
WE ARE CURRENTLY LEVERAGING --

00:43:45.823 --> 00:43:47.424
OPIOID MONEY FROM THE FEDERAL

00:43:47.491 --> 00:43:48.926
GOVERNMENT TO TRY --

00:43:48.993 --> 00:43:50.461
TO ADVANCE THAT IT REQUIRES

00:43:50.527 --> 00:43:52.429
ENTERING INTO DO USE AGREEMENTS

00:43:52.496 --> 00:43:53.797
WITH A VARIETY OF ENTITIES.

00:43:53.864 --> 00:43:54.932
AND WE'RE JUST BEGINNING THAT

00:43:54.999 --> 00:43:57.701
PROCESS I THINK WE HAVE A VERY

00:43:57.768 --> 00:44:00.437
REALISTIC PLAN I'M CONCERNED

00:44:00.504 --> 00:44:00.704
THOUGH --

00:44:00.771 --> 00:44:02.806
THE NEW AT THIS WE JUST GOT THE

00:44:02.873 --> 00:44:03.707
ANNOUNCEMENT FOR THE NEW OPIATE

00:44:03.774 --> 00:44:06.610
GRANT IS IT'S BEEN DECREASED-SUBSTANTIALLY --

00:44:06.677 --> 00:44:08.579
SO IT'S AGAIN IT'S AN ISSUE OF

00:44:08.645 --> 00:44:10.614
SUSTAINED FUNDING I THINK THAT

00:44:10.681 --> 00:44:12.916
DOT THAT KIND OF INFORMATION

00:44:12.983 --> 00:44:14.618
PARTICULARLY WITH THE ADVANCED

00:44:14.685 --> 00:44:16.387
ANALYTICS CAPABILITY THAT WE'VE

00:44:16.453 --> 00:44:18.155
ALSO BUILT IN.

00:44:18.222 --> 00:44:18.856
IS ACTUALLY GOING TO BE VERY

00:44:18.922 --> 00:44:20.190
HELPFUL AND US FIGURING OUT

00:44:20.257 --> 00:44:21.792
EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE ASKING IS

00:44:21.859 --> 00:44:24.128
WHAT CAPACITY DO WE ACTUALLY

00:44:24.194 --> 00:44:24.561
NEED --

00:44:24.628 --> 00:44:25.796
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW WE DON'T HAVE

00:44:25.863 --> 00:44:27.598
A GOOD OVER VIEW --

00:44:27.664 --> 00:44:29.600
OF THE THE BIGGER PICTURE

00:44:29.666 --> 00:44:31.735
FRANKLY.

00:44:31.802 --> 00:44:33.670
AND I SHOULD ACT SERVICE I KNOW

00:44:33.737 --> 00:44:35.005

TO ILLUSTRATE THE COMPLEXITY OF

00:46:08.632 --> 00:46:10.734
DOING DAYS WHERE WE HAD --

00:46:10.801 --> 00:46:12.402
IN A NEONATE NEONATAL INTENSIVE

00:46:12.469 --> 00:46:14.071
CARE UNIT --

00:46:14.138 --> 00:46:15.372
THERE WAS --

AND HE HAD MEASLES AS PART OF

00:46:21.145 --> 00:46:22.446
THE OUTBREAK --

00:46:22.513 --> 00:46:24.882

THEY'RE VERY HIGH RISK RIGHT OUR

00:46:31.655 --> 00:46:33.957
AND SO HE REALLY REQUIRED ALL

00:46:34.024 --> 00:46:34.858
HANDS ON DECK FROM THE COUNTY

00:46:34.925 --> 00:46:36.160
HEALTH DEPARTMENT PERSPECTIVE

00:46:36.226 --> 00:46:38.128

00:46:38.195 --> 00:46:39.463
ADDITIONAL CASES FROM THAT

00:46:39.530 --> 00:46:40.531
EXPOSURE.

00:46:40.597 --> 00:46:41.765
BUT THAT MEANS THAT THE COUNTY

00:46:41.832 --> 00:46:43.901
BASICALLY HOW TO STOP EVERYTHING

00:46:43.967 --> 00:46:45.302
THEY WERE DOING --

00:46:45.369 --> 00:46:49.039

I KNOW WE'VE HAD THIS

00:46:51.241 --> 00:46:51.742
CONVERSATION --

00:46:51.808 --> 00:46:53.377
IN TERMS OF US NEEDING TO BE

00:46:53.443 --> 00:46:54.678
BETTER UP ACCOUNTING. FOR

00:46:54.745 --> 00:46:56.280
RESOURCES ARE SPENT ON THESE

00:46:56.346 --> 00:46:58.015
OUTBREAKS ARE PARTICULARLY

00:46:58.081 --> 00:46:59.883
TRYING TO DO A PRO PROSPECTIVELY

00:46:59.950 --> 00:47:01.485
SO THAT WE CAN BETTER ACCOUNT

00:47:01.552 --> 00:47:03.053
AND WE WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON ON

00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:05.155
THAT FOR FUTURE OUTBREAKS.

00:47:05.222 --> 00:47:06.456
YOUR THROAT AND A ROUGH NUMBER

00:47:06.523 --> 00:47:08.592

YOU KNOW IT DEPENDS ALSO FROM

00:47:13.597 --> 00:47:16.533
WHAT ANGLE YOU SEE IT I MEAN THE

00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:18.135
COSTS ARE AMONG THE STATE.

00:47:18.202 --> 00:47:19.736
AND LOCAL HEALTH YEAH I THINK

00:47:19.803 --> 00:47:20.404
THAT LOW YET COST FOR LOCAL HELP

00:47:20.470 --> 00:47:21.071
THE OTHER PUBLIC HEALTH PARTS OF

00:47:21.138 --> 00:47:22.372
STATE HEALTH DEPARTMENT LOCAL

00:47:22.439 --> 00:47:23.006
HEALTH DEPARTMENTS NOT THE COST

00:47:23.073 --> 00:47:24.141
FOR HOSPITALIZATION FOR PEOPLE

00:47:24.208 --> 00:47:25.809

JUST THAT THE PUBLIC HEALTH COST

00:47:27.578 --> 00:47:28.579
I THINK I DON'T HAVE IF.

00:47:28.645 --> 00:47:31.882
YOU'RE A NEW BUT I KNOW WE'VE

00:47:31.949 --> 00:47:32.516

MILLIONS OR HUNDREDS OF

00:47:39.223 --> 00:47:41.091
THOUSANDS MILLIONS SO MILLIONS

00:47:41.158 --> 00:47:41.758

00:47:41.825 --> 00:47:43.260
DOLLARS FOR THIS.

00:47:43.327 --> 00:47:43.994
SMALL USED TO SAID WITH A SMALL

00:47:46.830 --> 00:47:48.098
COUNTY WHICH WAS NOT THE

00:47:48.165 --> 00:47:50.000
EPICENTER OUTBREAK ESTIMATED

00:47:50.067 --> 00:47:52.102
THAT IT COSTS THEM ON THE ORDER

00:47:52.169 --> 00:47:52.836
FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IN STAFF

00:58:02.111 --> 00:58:03.012
BUT THE SYSTEM IS REALLY IN

00:58:03.079 --> 00:58:04.547
PLACE TO HANDLE SMALL TO MEDIUM

00:58:04.614 --> 00:58:06.416
SIZED INCIDENTS THAT ARE

00:58:06.482 --> 00:58:08.117

01:06:58.180 --> 01:06:59.081
HAVE THOSE BETS.

01:06:59.148 --> 01:07:00.616
ARE THE HOSPITALS ARE HOLDING ON

01:07:00.683 --> 01:07:02.151
TO PATIENTS --

01:07:02.218 --> 01:07:04.186
FOR ABOUT THIRTY DAYS TO TRY TO

01:07:04.253 --> 01:07:07.623
FIND PLACEMENT OFTEN IN SOUTHERN

01:07:07.690 --> 01:07:09.024
CALIFORNIA.

01:07:09.091 --> 01:07:09.692
SO WHAT I'VE TRIED TO DO IS GIVE

01:07:09.759 --> 01:07:10.226
KIND OF A HIGH LEVEL OF

01:07:10.292 --> 01:07:10.793
UNDERSTANDING OF THE LOCAL

01:07:10.860 --> 01:07:12.728

A DISASTER --

01:07:15.164 --> 01:07:16.265
IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ALL

01:07:16.332 --> 01:07:17.600
THIS RESPONSE AND RECOVERY WORK

01:07:17.666 --> 01:07:18.801
IS DONE WITHOUT SPECIFIC

BUDGETARY RESOURCE ALL ROUTINE

01:07:21.203 --> 01:07:23.639

DURING THESE EVENTS.

01:07:27.576 --> 01:07:28.744
THERE'S REALLY NO CHOICE I IN

01:07:28.811 --> 01:07:30.279
OUR COUNTY WE HAD TWO PEOPLE

01:07:30.346 --> 01:07:31.914

AND WAS MOVED OUT OF THE AREA

01:07:36.952 --> 01:07:37.720
AND WAS NEVER INVOLVED IN THE

01:07:37.787 --> 01:07:39.221
RESPONSE WE ESSENTIALLY HAD ONE

01:07:39.288 --> 01:07:41.624
PERSON. TO TRY TO DO THAT

01:07:41.690 --> 01:07:43.058
OBVIOUSLY THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE SO

01:07:55.671 --> 01:07:57.072
AT THE LA COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF

LEARNED FROM THE RECENT

01:08:01.977 --> 01:08:03.712
HEPATITIS A OUTBREAK AMONG

01:08:03.779 --> 01:08:05.047
PERSONS EXPERIENCING

01:08:05.114 --> 01:08:06.982
HOMELESSNESS IN LOS ANGELES

01:08:07.049 --> 01:08:07.783
COUNTY.

01:08:07.850 --> 01:08:08.818
I'D LIKE TO START BY SAYING THAT

01:08:08.884 --> 01:08:10.553
THINGS TO THE EXTRAORDINARY WORK

01:08:10.619 --> 01:08:12.488
OF OUR STAFF WE WERE SUCCESSFUL

01:08:12.555 --> 01:08:14.023
IN STOPPING THIS OUTBREAK.

01:08:14.089 --> 01:08:16.525
BUT OUR RESPONSE SHOWED AREAS OF

01:08:16.592 --> 01:08:18.060
VULNERABILITY.

01:08:18.127 --> 01:08:19.762
IN JULY OF TWO THOUSAND AND

01:08:19.829 --> 01:08:20.896
SEVENTEEN WITH HUNDREDS OF CASES

01:08:20.963 --> 01:08:23.199
OF HEPATITIS A IN SAN DIEGO AND

01:08:23.265 --> 01:08:26.902
AN OUTBREAK IN SANTA CRUZ AND

01:08:26.969 --> 01:08:27.503
FIFTY EIGHT THOUSAND HOMELESS

01:08:27.570 --> 01:08:28.170
PERSONS IN OUR COUNTY.

01:08:28.237 --> 01:08:30.206
DPH WAS ACUTELY AWARE THAT WE

01:08:30.272 --> 01:08:31.807
WERE AT SERIOUS RISK OF AN

01:08:31.874 --> 01:08:32.608
OUTBREAK.

01:08:32.675 --> 01:08:34.677
HEPATITIS A IS A HIGHLY

01:08:34.743 --> 01:08:36.111
CONTAGIOUS VIRUS OF THE LIVER.

01:08:36.178 --> 01:08:38.447
IT SPREAD FROM PERSON TO PERSON

01:08:38.514 --> 01:08:39.882
THROUGH THE FECAL ORAL ROUTE.

01:08:39.949 --> 01:08:40.816
THE VIRUS CAN LIVE ON

01:08:40.883 --> 01:08:42.384
ENVIRONMENTAL SURFACES FOR NEXT

01:08:42.451 --> 01:08:44.954
SPEND AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME

01:08:45.020 --> 01:08:46.222
HOWEVER IT IS PREVENTABLE WITH

01:08:46.288 --> 01:08:49.091
GOOD SANITATION AND VACCINATION.

01:08:49.158 --> 01:08:50.559
PERSONS LIVING IN HOMELESS

01:08:50.626 --> 01:08:51.827
ENCAMPMENTS ARE PARTICULARLY

01:08:51.894 --> 01:08:53.262
SUSCEPTIBLE TO HEPATITIS C.

01:08:53.329 --> 01:08:54.930
OUTBREAKS BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF

01:08:54.997 --> 01:08:56.165
TOILETS IN HAND WASHING

01:08:56.232 --> 01:08:57.900
FACILITIES.

01:08:57.967 --> 01:08:59.435
RESIDENTS LIVE IN CLOSE QUARTERS

01:08:59.502 --> 01:09:00.436
AND RESPECT YOURS FOR

01:09:00.503 --> 01:09:02.004
EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS SUCH

01:09:02.071 --> 01:09:04.306
AS DRUG USE CAN ALSO CONTRIBUTE

01:09:04.373 --> 01:09:06.542
TO THE SPREAD OF HEPATITIS SAY.

01:09:06.609 --> 01:09:07.543
PRISONS EXPERIENCING

01:09:07.610 --> 01:09:08.844
HOMELESSNESS CAN ALSO BE VERY

01:09:08.911 --> 01:09:11.113
DIFFICULT TO REACH AND PROTECT.

01:09:11.180 --> 01:09:12.581
OUR IN PART BECAUSE THEY HAVE

01:09:12.648 --> 01:09:14.149
OTHER MEDICAL AND PSYCHOSOCIAL

01:09:14.216 --> 01:09:16.318
STRESSORS THE PREVENT THEM FROM

01:09:16.385 --> 01:09:18.988
SEEKING PREVENTIVE CARE WERE

01:09:19.054 --> 01:09:20.556
DELAY CARE WHEN THEY BECOME ILL.

01:09:20.623 --> 01:09:21.991
IN LA COUNTY WE BENEFITED FROM

01:09:22.057 --> 01:09:24.093
THE EARLY LESSONS IN SAN DIEGO

01:09:24.159 --> 01:09:25.227
AND SANTA CRUZ.

01:09:25.294 --> 01:09:25.995
EFFORTS TO QUICKLY IDENTIFY AND

01:09:26.061 --> 01:09:29.365
RESPOND IMPORTED TO THE COUNTY

01:09:29.431 --> 01:09:31.700
MAY HAVE BEEN KEY IN PREVENTING

01:09:31.767 --> 01:09:33.202
A SIGNIFICANT OUTBREAK.

01:09:33.269 --> 01:09:35.504
WE ALSO PARTNERED WITH COMMUNITY

01:09:35.571 --> 01:09:37.373
OUTREACH ORGANIZATIONS AND

01:09:37.439 --> 01:09:38.474
WORKING WITH THESE PARTNERS

01:09:38.541 --> 01:09:40.709
DISTRIBUTED THIRTY SIX THOUSAND

01:09:40.776 --> 01:09:41.777
VACCINES.

01:09:41.844 --> 01:09:43.345
AND WORK TO IMPROVE THESE A

01:09:43.412 --> 01:09:44.813
SANITARY CONDITIONS IN THE

01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:46.715
ENCAMPMENTS WHICH MANAGED TO

01:09:46.782 --> 01:09:48.517
KEEP CASES TO A MINIMUM THIS

01:09:48.584 --> 01:09:49.752
TIME.

01:09:49.818 --> 01:09:51.120
THE OUTBREAK WHICH INCLUDED MORE

01:09:51.186 --> 01:09:53.055
THAN SEVEN HUNDRED CASES IN

01:09:53.122 --> 01:09:54.123
TWENTY ONE THE STATE WIDE

01:09:54.189 --> 01:09:55.891
HOWEVER ILLUSTRATES THE CRITICAL

01:09:55.958 --> 01:09:58.260
NEED FOR FUNDING. TO SUPPORT

01:09:58.327 --> 01:10:00.729
BASIC HUMAN NEEDS ADEQUATE

01:10:00.796 --> 01:10:02.064
HOUSING AND SANITATION.

01:10:02.131 --> 01:10:03.332
AMONG OUR HOMELESS CITIZENS

01:10:03.399 --> 01:10:05.334
THERE'S ALSO A NEED FOR MENTAL

01:10:05.401 --> 01:10:07.503
HEALTH SUBSTANCE USE AND SOCIAL

01:10:07.570 --> 01:10:08.671
SUPPORT SERVICES.

01:10:08.737 --> 01:10:10.072
AT POINTS WE DID NOT HAVE

01:10:10.139 --> 01:10:11.473
ADEQUATE FACILITIES FOR RECOUP

01:10:11.540 --> 01:10:13.609
PART OF CARE FOR OUR PATIENTS

01:10:13.676 --> 01:10:14.877
WHO WERE SOMETIMES DISCHARGED

01:10:14.944 --> 01:10:16.612
WHILE INFECTIOUS BACK TO

01:10:16.679 --> 01:10:19.448
ENCAMPMENTS WHICH POTENTIALLY

01:10:19.515 --> 01:10:20.950
FURTHER THE SPREAD OF INFECTION.

01:10:21.016 --> 01:10:22.284
OUR DEPARTMENT MOUNTED AN

01:10:22.351 --> 01:10:24.086
AGGRESSIVE RESPONSES PEOPLE HAVE

01:10:24.153 --> 01:10:25.554
DESCRIBED ELSEWHERE BY MOVING

01:10:25.621 --> 01:10:26.655
STAFF FROM THEIR REGULAR

01:10:26.722 --> 01:10:29.291
POSITIONS TO EMERGENCY WORK FROM

01:10:29.358 --> 01:10:31.060
JULY OF TWO THOUSAND AND

01:10:31.126 --> 01:10:31.994
SEVENTEEN THROUGH MARCH OF TWO

01:10:32.061 --> 01:10:34.263
THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN DURING

01:10:34.330 --> 01:10:36.932
THIS TIME NON AS THE WORK SLOWED

01:10:36.999 --> 01:10:38.100
OR STOPPED ALL TOGETHER.

01:10:38.167 --> 01:10:40.069
A VERY SIGNIFICANT CONSEQUENCE

01:10:40.135 --> 01:10:42.571
WAS A DELAY IN BASIC PROCUREMENT

01:10:42.638 --> 01:10:43.839
WHICH LED TO SHORTAGES IN

01:10:43.906 --> 01:10:45.941
LABORATORY AND CLINICAL SUPPLIES

01:10:46.008 --> 01:10:47.176
LATER IN THE YEAR.

01:10:47.242 --> 01:10:48.611
THERE WAS AN EXTREME TOLL ON OUR

01:10:48.677 --> 01:10:50.713
WORKFORCE WHO WORKED OVERTIME

01:10:50.779 --> 01:10:52.648
FOR MANY MANY WEEKS IF WE'D HAD

01:10:52.715 --> 01:10:54.617
ANOTHER OUTBREAK AT THE SAME

01:10:54.683 --> 01:10:56.418
TIME WE WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY

01:10:56.485 --> 01:10:58.187
VULNERABLE. ONE OF THE STRONGEST

01:10:58.253 --> 01:11:00.189
TOOLS IN ADDRESSING AN EPIDEMIC

01:11:00.255 --> 01:11:01.790
IS THE PUBLIC HEALTH LABORATORY

01:11:01.857 --> 01:11:03.425
WE FOUND TO DURING OUR HEPATITIS

01:11:03.492 --> 01:11:05.160
A RESPONSE THAT SOME HOSPITALS

01:11:05.227 --> 01:11:07.396
WERE BATCHING OR SENDING OUT.

01:11:07.463 --> 01:11:09.398
TESTS WHICH DELAYED CRITICAL

01:11:09.465 --> 01:11:11.667
DIAGNOSTICS SO OUR PUBLIC HEALTH

01:11:11.734 --> 01:11:14.036
LABORATORY STEPPED IN TO PROVIDE

01:11:14.103 --> 01:11:15.571
REAL TIME TESTING FOR THESE

01:11:15.638 --> 01:11:18.240
FACILITIES. FOR SOME DISEASES

01:11:18.307 --> 01:11:20.709
SUCH AS BOTULISM EBOLA ONLY THE

01:11:20.776 --> 01:11:22.478
PUBLIC HEALTH LABORATORY CAN DO

01:11:22.544 --> 01:11:23.712
THE TESTING.

01:11:23.779 --> 01:11:27.116
THE US PUBLIC HEALTH LABS MUST

01:11:27.182 --> 01:11:27.650
BE SUPPORTED WITH ADEQUATE

01:11:27.716 --> 01:11:28.317
FUNDING.

01:11:28.384 --> 01:11:29.585
ADDITIONALLY IN THE TWENTY FIRST

01:11:29.652 --> 01:11:31.587
CENTURY DIGITAL INFRASTRUCTURE

01:11:31.654 --> 01:11:33.088
IS PARAMOUNT AND THERE WAS A

01:11:33.155 --> 01:11:34.690
DISCUSSION OF ELECTRONIC

01:11:34.757 --> 01:11:36.525
LABORATORY REPORTING EARLIER AND

01:11:36.592 --> 01:11:38.360
IT'S CRITICAL FOR THE CONTROL OF

01:11:38.427 --> 01:11:39.495
INFECTIOUS DISEASES.

01:11:39.561 --> 01:11:40.229
HOWEVER DURING THE HEPATITIS A

01:11:40.295 --> 01:11:43.265
OUTBREAK OCCASIONS THE ENTIRE

01:11:43.332 --> 01:11:45.668
AEO OUR SYSTEM WENT DOWN AND WE

01:11:45.734 --> 01:11:46.902
DIDN'T GET IT.

01:11:46.969 --> 01:11:48.637
FOR SOME HOSPITALS WHICH AREN'T

01:11:48.704 --> 01:11:50.472
ON THE ELECTRONIC WEB REPORTING

01:11:50.539 --> 01:11:52.341
SYSTEM --

01:11:52.408 --> 01:11:53.776
DELAYED THERE REPORTING FROM

01:11:53.842 --> 01:11:55.978
WHICH CRITICALLY DELAYED A

01:11:56.045 --> 01:11:57.813
RESPONSE IN CERTAIN CASES.

01:11:57.880 --> 01:11:59.148
SO AS THE WORLD MOVES FASTER AND

01:11:59.214 --> 01:12:00.883
FASTER AND WE FACE EVER MORE

01:12:00.949 --> 01:12:02.551
EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASE

01:12:02.618 --> 01:12:04.887
THREATS WE NEED MORE OF A STABLE

CALIFORNIA AND THESE NEEDS AR

01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:13.996
ONLY GOING TO BECOME MORE

01:12:14.063 --> 01:12:15.397
COMPLEX AS WE GO FORWARD.

01:12:15.464 --> 01:12:16.565
A STRONG PUBLIC HEALTH

ADDRESS COMMUNICABLE DISEASES IN

01:12:22.171 --> 01:12:23.739
CALIFORNIA WE CAN DETERMINE OUR

01:12:23.806 --> 01:12:25.140

IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO

01:15:46.675 --> 01:15:47.209

01:17:13.261 --> 01:17:14.329
ANYBODY HERE --

01:17:14.396 --> 01:17:18.467
SINCE YOU GOT YOUR OWN

WE WE CURRENTLY HAVE SORT OF A

01:17:24.439 --> 01:17:25.807
SYSTEM --

01:17:25.874 --> 01:17:27.642
AND BUT IS THE TO RE CREATE A

01:17:27.709 --> 01:17:28.643
MORE FORMAL SYSTEM SHOULD WE DO

01:17:28.710 --> 01:17:30.145
MORE OF MORE FORMAL SUSPEND AND

01:17:30.212 --> 01:17:32.547
TERMS OF NEW.

01:17:32.614 --> 01:17:33.882
PUBLIC HEALTH NURSES AND

01:17:33.949 --> 01:17:35.083
EPIDEMIOLOGISTS YOU KNOW AND

01:17:35.150 --> 01:17:36.551
SITTING AROUND IN THE WAR ROOM

01:17:36.618 --> 01:17:37.552
JUST WAITING FOR SOMETHING TO

01:17:37.619 --> 01:17:38.420
HAPPEN BUT THERE'S ALWAYS

01:17:38.487 --> 01:17:39.921
SOMETHING HAPPENING BY THE

01:17:39.988 --> 01:17:40.655
WEIGHT BUT AS YOU KNOW --

01:17:40.722 --> 01:17:42.624
BUT BUT BASICALLY SAYING LOOK

01:17:42.691 --> 01:17:44.526
MAYBE THE WAY WE SHOULD APPROACH

01:17:44.593 --> 01:17:45.694
THIS IS IS THAT WE ACTUALLY HAVE

01:17:45.761 --> 01:17:47.896
A LITTLE EXTRA CAPACITY THAT IS

01:17:47.963 --> 01:17:49.364
FUNDED TO SPREAD AROUND

01:17:49.431 --> 01:17:51.066
DIFFERENT PLACES THERE'S

01:17:51.133 --> 01:17:51.666
CERTAINLY PLENTY OF WORK TO DO

01:17:51.733 --> 01:17:52.901
BUT THEN --

01:17:52.968 --> 01:17:54.603
INTO IT AND EVENTS --

01:17:54.669 --> 01:17:58.206
WE'RE NOT SO THE THE DEPEND NOW

01:17:58.273 --> 01:17:59.841
PULLING PEOPLE OFF FROM THERE --

01:17:59.908 --> 01:18:01.109
LESS URGENT ACTIVITIES AS MUCH

01:18:01.176 --> 01:18:02.411
THAT WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY

01:18:02.477 --> 01:18:03.578
CAN HELP OUT WITH ON GOING

01:18:03.645 --> 01:18:04.980
ACTIVITIES BUT THEN --

01:18:05.047 --> 01:18:06.515
WOULD BE MORE AVAILABLE --

01:18:06.581 --> 01:18:07.983
AND NOT HAVE TO STRESS THAT

01:18:08.050 --> 01:18:09.351
EXISTING ACTIVITIES SOME

01:18:09.418 --> 01:18:10.786
THOUGHTS ON THAT.

01:18:10.852 --> 01:18:12.921
ABSOLUTELY I THINK ALL OF YOU OF

01:18:12.988 --> 01:18:13.889
YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT SO SO IF

01:18:13.955 --> 01:18:14.923
YOU EXPLAINED IT EXACTLY RIGHT

01:18:14.990 --> 01:18:16.425
BUT WE REALLY NEED IS TO BUILD

01:18:16.491 --> 01:18:18.160
CAPACITY AT THE LOCAL.

01:18:18.226 --> 01:18:20.095
LEVEL TO TO DO A VARIETY OF

01:18:20.162 --> 01:18:21.663
THINGS AND IF WORD SUCCESS WITH

01:18:21.730 --> 01:18:23.365
OUR IMMUNIZATION EFFORTS AN STD

01:18:23.432 --> 01:18:24.699
CONTROL IN GENERAL DISEASE

01:18:24.766 --> 01:18:26.201
CONTROL THOSE STAFF CAN BE

01:18:26.268 --> 01:18:27.736
REDIRECTED DURING AN EMERGENCY.

01:18:27.803 --> 01:18:29.104
AND WE'LL HAVE MORE ABILITY TO

01:18:29.171 --> 01:18:30.238
CONTINUE TO DO THOSE ESSENTIAL

01:18:30.305 --> 01:18:32.941
SERVICES WHILE RESPONDING TO THE

01:18:33.008 --> 01:18:33.909
SEARCH THAT'S NEEDED.

01:18:33.975 --> 01:18:37.979
IN TERMS OF THE OFFICIAL SYSTEM --

01:18:38.046 --> 01:18:40.916
IS SIMILAR TO FIRE SO FOR HOW WE

01:18:40.982 --> 01:18:42.818
REQUEST RESOURCES FROM OTHER TO

01:18:42.884 --> 01:18:45.387
OTHER JURISDICTIONS --

01:18:45.454 --> 01:18:47.155
SO THAT THE SYSTEM IS THERE TO

01:18:47.222 --> 01:18:48.690
MAKE THOSE REQUESTS LARGER

01:18:48.757 --> 01:18:49.991
JURISDICTIONS WOULD BE ABLE TO

01:18:50.058 --> 01:18:51.460
PROVIDE SOME RESOURCES THAT I

01:18:51.526 --> 01:18:52.794
CAN SPEAK FOR RIVERSIDE COUNTY

01:18:52.861 --> 01:18:53.795
WE'VE WE TRY.

01:18:53.862 --> 01:18:55.397
TO PROVIDE RESOURCES WHENEVER WE

01:18:55.464 --> 01:18:56.565
CAN TO HELP OUR PARTNERS BECAUSE

01:18:56.631 --> 01:18:58.567
THEN HOPEFULLY THEY'LL BE THERE

01:18:58.633 --> 01:18:59.868
FOR US WHEN WE NEED THEM --

01:18:59.935 --> 01:19:02.571

01:19:04.439 --> 01:19:05.807
EXAMPLE IN --

01:19:05.874 --> 01:19:07.542
REGION SIX WERE RIVERSIDE IS SO

01:19:07.609 --> 01:19:09.377
RIVERSIDE SALMON DINO INYO MONO

01:19:09.444 --> 01:19:10.479
SAN DIEGO --

01:19:10.545 --> 01:19:11.580
AN IMPERIAL COUNTIES WE'VE

01:19:11.646 --> 01:19:12.914
SIGNED AN AGREEMENT TO SHARE

01:19:12.981 --> 01:19:14.716
STAFF AND RESOURCES DURING AN

01:19:14.783 --> 01:19:16.184
EMERGENCY AND SO WE'VE ALREADY

01:19:16.251 --> 01:19:17.752
OUTLINED THE TERMS OF

01:19:17.819 --> 01:19:19.221
REIMBURSEMENT AND AND THOSE

01:19:19.287 --> 01:19:20.789
TYPES OF THINGS SO SO I THINK

01:19:20.856 --> 01:19:21.990
THAT THE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR

01:19:22.057 --> 01:19:24.292
SHARING RESOURCES IS THERE --

01:19:24.359 --> 01:19:25.660
IT'S JUST A MATTER OF HAVING THE

01:19:25.727 --> 01:19:26.661
RESOURCES TO BE ABLE TO SHARE

01:19:26.728 --> 01:19:28.196
AND THERE'S QUITE A DISPARITY

01:19:28.263 --> 01:19:29.698
BEING ABLE TO DO THAT BUT YOU

01:19:29.764 --> 01:19:30.732
KNOW FOR EXAMPLE.

01:19:30.799 --> 01:19:32.501
THAT THE STATE WILL PAY FOR SOME

01:19:32.567 --> 01:19:34.269
FIRE TRUCKS THAT COULD BE USED

01:19:34.336 --> 01:19:37.072
STRAIGHT AND THINGS LIKE SO WE

01:19:37.139 --> 01:19:38.807
WENT WITH THINK ABOUT.

01:19:38.874 --> 01:19:40.942
THIS WE TRIED OF ALL OF THAT --

01:19:41.009 --> 01:19:42.911
HOW DO SAID DISAGREEMENTS ALSO

01:19:42.978 --> 01:19:44.880
WHERE SOME THE THINGS THAT

01:19:44.946 --> 01:19:46.014
SAMPLE YOU'LL SHOULD STATE

01:19:46.081 --> 01:19:47.482
PIGEON SOME RESOURCES RIGHT --

01:19:47.549 --> 01:19:53.021

01:20:00.862 --> 01:20:01.663
FOR PUBLIC HEALTH IS IS THAT

01:20:01.730 --> 01:20:03.732
YOUR SUCCESS IS MEASURED BY

01:20:03.798 --> 01:20:05.534
THINGS THAT DON'T HAPPEN.

01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:06.601
RIGHT AND THAT THAT DOESN'T TEND

01:20:06.668 --> 01:20:08.904
TO MAKE THE NEWS AS MUCH --

01:20:08.970 --> 01:20:13.175

HOW BIG WAS YOUR DEPARTMENT

01:20:17.779 --> 01:20:20.015
BEFORE.

01:20:20.081 --> 01:20:21.116
THE FIRES CAME HOW WOULD YOU

01:20:21.183 --> 01:20:21.750
START WITH THAT THE DEPARTMENT

01:20:21.816 --> 01:20:23.451
IS ABOUT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY

01:20:23.518 --> 01:20:24.419
PEOPLE TOTAL --

01:20:24.486 --> 01:20:25.253
AND THAT INCLUDES EVERYBODY

01:20:25.320 --> 01:20:26.521
THERE ARE PEOPLE DOING ALL KINDS

01:20:26.588 --> 01:20:28.023
OF DIFFERENT PROGRAMS SO THAT'S

01:20:28.089 --> 01:20:29.457
THAT'S THE SIZE.

01:20:29.524 --> 01:20:32.060
AND YOU KNOW WE WE GHOST UP

01:20:32.127 --> 01:20:34.162
THROUGH THE HIERARCHY THAT WAS

01:20:34.229 --> 01:20:36.765
JUST DESCRIBED AND ASK WITHIN

01:20:36.831 --> 01:20:38.166
OUR REGION I YOU KNOW EITHER

01:20:38.233 --> 01:20:39.701
FORTUNATELY UNFORTUNATELY FOR US

01:20:39.768 --> 01:20:41.303
WE'RE IN A PRETTY RURAL AREA SO

01:20:41.369 --> 01:20:42.771
THERE AREN'T MANY RESOURCES WE

01:20:42.837 --> 01:20:43.805
TEND TO BE.

01:20:43.872 --> 01:20:47.876
THE THE COUNTY IN THE AREA THAT

01:20:47.943 --> 01:20:49.477
SO WITHIN OUR REGION YOU KNOW WE

01:20:49.544 --> 01:20:50.679
NEED TO FOLLOW THAT HIERARCHY

01:20:50.745 --> 01:20:52.314
WHICH WE DO --

01:20:52.380 --> 01:20:53.648
WE DID RECEIVE.

01:20:53.715 --> 01:20:56.918
HELP FROM FOLKS IN THE BAY AREA --

01:20:56.985 --> 01:20:58.587
THERE WE RECEIVED FOR FOLKS FROM

01:20:58.653 --> 01:21:00.822
FROM ALL OVER AND STILL IT WAS

01:21:00.889 --> 01:21:02.524
DIFFICULT AND AND I'LL SAY THAT

01:21:02.591 --> 01:21:05.093
BECAUSE DISASTERS ARE LOCAL AND

01:21:05.160 --> 01:21:06.795
THERE'S OVERSIGHT THAT'S

01:21:06.861 --> 01:21:08.163
REQUIRED TO BE DONE LOCALLY.

01:21:08.230 --> 01:21:09.798
EVEN WITH ALL THAT HELP

01:21:09.864 --> 01:21:12.334
SOMETIMES JUST I CAN MANAGING

01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:14.669
ALL OF THAT HELP CAN BE AN ISSUE

01:21:14.736 --> 01:21:16.071
AND OF MY ANIMAL CONTROL

01:21:16.137 --> 01:21:17.806
DIRECTOR WE'RE HERE HE COULD

01:21:17.872 --> 01:21:19.107
TELL YOUR GREAT STORIES ABOUT

01:21:19.174 --> 01:21:20.141
PEOPLE COME IN AND WANT TO HELP

01:21:20.208 --> 01:21:21.109
ANIMALS.

01:21:21.176 --> 01:21:23.111
BUT REALLYMUDDYING THE WATERS

01:21:23.178 --> 01:21:24.646
SIGNIFICANTLY IN CAUSING ALMOST

01:21:24.713 --> 01:21:26.881
AS MANY PROBLEMS AS THEY HELPED

01:21:26.948 --> 01:21:29.985
TO TAKE CARE OF BUT YEAH SO FOR

01:21:30.051 --> 01:21:32.354
US REGIONALLY THERE'S NOT THAT

01:21:32.420 --> 01:21:34.823
MUCH HELP BUT BUT STATEWIDE AND

01:21:34.889 --> 01:21:35.323
YOU KNOW THEY'RE THEY'RE

01:21:35.390 --> 01:21:37.125
DEFINITELY SPACE.

01:21:37.192 --> 01:21:38.126
FOR MORE AGREEMENTS AHEAD OF

01:21:38.193 --> 01:21:40.262
TIME AND I THINK IN ALL HONESTY

01:21:40.328 --> 01:21:43.331
WE ALL HAVE TO FOSTER A AN ETHIC

01:21:43.398 --> 01:21:45.133
OF RESPONSE WHICH WE HAVE NOT

01:21:45.200 --> 01:21:48.003
REALLY HAD TO DO AS OF YET --

01:21:48.069 --> 01:21:49.704
AND THAT'S AND AT EVERY LEVEL AT

01:21:49.771 --> 01:21:51.906
THE LOCAL LEVEL AT EVERY LEVEL

01:21:51.973 --> 01:21:53.475
AND REALIZE THAT WE ARE A PART

01:21:53.541 --> 01:21:55.010
OF THE RESPONSE BECAUSE WITHOUT

01:21:55.076 --> 01:21:57.479
THAT ETHIC IT'S EASY TO JUST

01:21:57.545 --> 01:22:01.449
HOPE IT DOESN'T HAPPEN TO YOU.

01:22:01.516 --> 01:22:03.785

PREVENTING ONE CASE OF

COMMUNITY PROVIDERS.

01:34:15.016 --> 01:34:16.817
IF THIS PREGNANT PATIENT HAD HAD

01:34:16.884 --> 01:34:18.219
PRENATAL CARE AND SHE BEEN

01:34:18.285 --> 01:34:19.787
DIAGNOSED EARLIER THERE'S A HIGH

01:34:19.854 --> 01:34:20.888
LIKELIHOOD THAT WE WOULD HAVE

01:34:20.955 --> 01:34:22.123
BEEN CALLED TO HELP GUIDE

01:34:23.791 --> 01:34:25.726
STEPS.

01:34:25.793 --> 01:34:27.628
SEVERAL COMMUNITY PROVIDERS ALSO

01:34:27.695 --> 01:34:28.763
DON'T CARRY THE REQUIRED

MEDICATION TO TREAT SYPHILIS AND

01:34:30.998 --> 01:34:32.500
IN THAT CASE OUR HEALTH

01:34:32.566 --> 01:34:34.935
DEPARTMENT STD CLINIC WILL TREAT

01:34:35.002 --> 01:34:36.237
THESE PATIENTS.

01:34:36.303 --> 01:34:37.705
IN THE MANY CALIFORNIA'S

01:34:37.772 --> 01:34:39.640
JURISDICTIONS THE DON'T HAVE STD

01:34:39.707 --> 01:34:41.375
CLINICS THIS IS NOT EVEN AN

01:34:41.442 --> 01:34:44.578
OPTION.

01:34:44.645 --> 01:34:46.614
WE'VE HAD TO DO ALL.

01:34:46.680 --> 01:34:47.948
WE'VE HAD TO DO ALL OF THIS WITH

01:34:48.015 --> 01:34:49.683
VERY LITTLE STAFF AND WE'VE HAD

01:34:49.750 --> 01:34:51.485
TO MAKE SOME HARD CHOICES.

01:34:51.552 --> 01:34:52.887
FEDERAL FUNDING FOR STD CONTROL

01:34:52.953 --> 01:34:55.122
EFFORTS DECREASED BY TWENTY ONE

01:34:55.189 --> 01:34:57.224
MILLION DOLLARS BETWEEN TWO

01:34:57.291 --> 01:34:58.692
THOUSAND THREE IN.

01:34:58.759 --> 01:34:59.326
TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THIS IS A

FOR INFLATION.

01:35:04.331 --> 01:35:05.800
SO WHILE THE RATES OF STDS ARE

01:35:05.866 --> 01:35:08.002
AT ALL TIME HIGHS THE FUNDING IS

01:35:08.069 --> 01:35:09.703
AT ALL TIME LOWS.

01:35:09.770 --> 01:35:11.272
IN LONG BEACH ALTHOUGH WE HAVE

01:35:11.338 --> 01:35:12.239
SOME OF THE HIGHEST RATES IN THE

01:35:12.306 --> 01:35:13.574
STATE WE ONLY HAVE ENOUGH

AS WELL AS THROUGHOUT THE STATE

01:35:21.415 --> 01:35:22.716
HEALTH DEPARTMENTS HAVE HAD TO

01:35:22.783 --> 01:35:23.984
FOCUS THEIR ATTENTION AND

01:35:24.051 --> 01:35:25.419
RESOURCES ON PREVENTING

01:35:25.486 --> 01:35:26.754
CONGENITAL SYPHILIS.

01:35:26.821 --> 01:35:28.722
AND IT'S STILL NOT ENOUGH.

01:35:28.789 --> 01:35:30.324
INVESTIGATING SYPHILIS CASES IN

01:35:30.391 --> 01:35:32.259

AND INVESTIGATING CHLAMYDIA AND

01:35:35.763 --> 01:35:36.797
MOST GONORRHEA CASES IS

01:35:36.864 --> 01:35:38.532
IMPOSSIBLE.

01:35:38.599 --> 01:35:40.167
WE'VE HAD TO REDIRECT STAFF FROM

01:35:40.234 --> 01:35:41.469
OTHER PROGRAMS JUST TO STAY

01:35:41.535 --> 01:35:43.237
BARELY AHEAD OF THE MOST

01:35:43.304 --> 01:35:45.406
IMPORTANT STD CASES NOT REALLY

01:35:45.473 --> 01:35:46.841
MAKING A DENT IN THE OVERALL

01:35:56.884 --> 01:35:58.586
IT WILL REQUIRE SUSTAINED

01:35:58.652 --> 01:36:00.287

01:43:28.735 --> 01:43:30.203
BUT BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND AND

01:43:30.270 --> 01:43:33.073
TWELVE AND TWO THOUSAND AND

01:43:33.140 --> 01:43:33.674
SEVENTEEN TWENTY SIX THOUSAND

01:43:33.740 --> 01:43:34.174
PEOPLE IN THE STATE OF

01:43:34.241 --> 01:43:35.576
CALIFORNIA WERE SICK ENOUGH TO

01:43:35.642 --> 01:43:37.010
GO TO THE DOCTOR AND TO BE

01:43:37.077 --> 01:43:40.480
DIAGNOSED WITH VALLEY FEVER --

01:43:40.547 --> 01:43:41.081
TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN SAW THE

01:43:41.148 --> 01:43:42.749
HIGHEST NUMBER OF CASES ABOUT A

01:43:42.816 --> 01:43:44.051
FEVER IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

01:43:44.117 --> 01:43:45.786
IN THE HISTORY OF VALLEY FEVER

01:43:45.852 --> 01:43:48.355
AND THE PRELIMINARY DATA FOR TWO

01:43:48.422 --> 01:43:49.590
THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN SUGGEST.

01:43:49.656 --> 01:43:51.358
THAT THE NUMBER IS GOING TO BE

01:43:51.425 --> 01:43:54.494
AS HIGH OR EVEN HIGHER. 40% OF

01:43:54.561 --> 01:43:56.096
CALIFORNIANS DIAGNOSE OF VALUE

01:43:56.163 --> 01:43:57.664
RELIVING KERN COUNTY.

01:43:57.731 --> 01:43:58.999
IT AFFECTS MY COMMUNITY MORE

01:43:59.066 --> 01:44:00.300
THAN ANY OTHER COMMUNITY IN THE

01:44:00.367 --> 01:44:02.369
STATE BUT EFFECTS SO MANY PEOPLE

01:44:02.436 --> 01:44:04.571
IN CALIFORNIA.

01:44:04.638 --> 01:44:06.139
THERE'S ONE BIG TOWN WHEN IT

01:44:06.206 --> 01:44:08.041
COMES TO VALLEY FEVER AND IT

01:44:08.108 --> 01:44:09.810
THAT'S IT'S A REGIONAL DISEASE.

01:44:09.876 --> 01:44:11.612
ON THE FUNGUS IS FOUND MAINLY IN

01:44:11.678 --> 01:44:13.280
THE SOUTHWESTERN UNITED STATES

01:44:13.347 --> 01:44:14.181
INCLUDING MANY PARTS OF

01:44:14.247 --> 01:44:15.716
CALIFORNIA.

01:44:15.782 --> 01:44:16.550
BUT IF YOU HAVEN'T LIVED HERE

01:44:16.617 --> 01:44:18.051
LONG OR IF YOU'RE A MEDICAL

01:44:18.118 --> 01:44:19.486
PROVIDER WHO WASN'T TRAINED IN

01:44:19.553 --> 01:44:20.721
THIS AREA YOU MAY HAVE NEVER

01:44:20.787 --> 01:44:22.656
HEARD OF IT AND YOUR KNOWLEDGE

01:44:22.723 --> 01:44:23.190
OF THE DISEASE MAY BE VERY

01:44:23.256 --> 01:44:24.992
LIMITED.

01:44:25.058 --> 01:44:26.893
VALUE HAS VERY COMMON SYMPTOMS

01:44:26.960 --> 01:44:28.895
YOU CAN TALK ABOUT A FEVER A

01:44:28.962 --> 01:44:29.930
COUGH SHORTNESS OF BREATH

01:44:29.997 --> 01:44:31.732
TIREDNESS.

01:44:31.798 --> 01:44:33.800
ALONE OR IN COMBINATION THAT

01:44:33.867 --> 01:44:34.368
COULD BE A MILLION DIFFERENT

01:44:34.434 --> 01:44:36.403
DISEASES.

01:44:36.470 --> 01:44:38.839
SO MANY OF US AS PATIENTS AS

01:44:38.905 --> 01:44:39.406
PEOPLE WE WAIT TO GO TO THE

01:44:39.473 --> 01:44:41.875
DOCTOR --

01:44:41.942 --> 01:44:43.276
SOME OF US WAIT SO LONG THAT WE

01:44:43.343 --> 01:44:44.011
END UP IN THE EMERGENCY

01:44:44.077 --> 01:44:45.112
DEPARTMENT OR WE HAVE TO BE

01:44:45.178 --> 01:44:48.181
HOSPITALIZED.

01:44:48.248 --> 01:44:49.683
WE MISS ANYWHERE FROM A WEEK OF

01:44:49.750 --> 01:44:51.151
WORK TO SIX WEEKS OF WORK ON

01:44:51.218 --> 01:44:53.286
AVERAGE.

01:44:53.353 --> 01:44:54.755
AND WE AS PATIENTS CAN BE OUR

01:44:54.821 --> 01:44:55.822
OWN WORST ENEMY IN REGARDS TO

01:44:55.889 --> 01:44:57.290
THE LIKE THE ROOM.

01:44:57.357 --> 01:44:59.092
EVEN PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN AREAS

01:44:59.159 --> 01:45:00.360
LIKE KERN COUNTY WERE VALLEY

01:45:00.427 --> 01:45:02.229
FEVER IS VERY COMMON AND CAN BE

01:45:02.295 --> 01:45:03.730
MISINFORMED ABOUT THE DISEASE

01:45:03.797 --> 01:45:04.998
AND ABOUT THEIR RISK.

01:45:05.065 --> 01:45:06.266
SO ALL OF US WOULD BENEFIT FROM

01:45:06.333 --> 01:45:08.468
WHERE EDUCATION.

01:45:08.535 --> 01:45:09.436
AND THEN OF COURSE ONCE WE

01:45:09.503 --> 01:45:11.071
DECIDE WERE SICK ENOUGH TO GO TO

01:45:11.138 --> 01:45:12.572
THE DOCTOR --

01:45:12.639 --> 01:45:13.740
WE DEPEND ON OUR DOCTOR TO KNOW

01:45:13.807 --> 01:45:16.209
ABOUT VALLEY FEVER AND TO TEST.

01:45:16.276 --> 01:45:17.644
FOR A STUDY THAT WAS IN ABOUT

01:45:17.711 --> 01:45:18.378
TEN YEARS AGO --

01:45:18.445 --> 01:45:20.047
FOUND THAT IT TOOK AN AVERAGE OF

01:45:20.113 --> 01:45:21.281
TWENTY THREE DAYS FROM THE TIME

01:45:21.348 --> 01:45:22.683
THE PATIENT FIRST THOUGHT HEALTH

01:45:22.749 --> 01:45:24.217
CARE TO BE DIAGNOSED WITH VALLEY

01:45:24.284 --> 01:45:26.753
FEVER. 60% OF PEOPLE OR

01:45:26.820 --> 01:45:28.355
PRESCRIBE ANTIBIOTICS THAT THEY

01:45:28.422 --> 01:45:29.956
DIDN'T NEED AND WOULDN'T HELP

01:45:30.023 --> 01:45:32.592
THEIR INFECTION OF VALLEY FEVER.

01:45:32.659 --> 01:45:34.661
IN KERN COUNTY WERE ALMOST EVERY

01:45:34.728 --> 01:45:36.697
COMMUNITY IN ART EIGHT THOUSAND

01:45:36.763 --> 01:45:38.498
SQUARE MILES IS A FEDERALLY

01:45:38.565 --> 01:45:39.499
DESIGNATED HEALTH CARE PROVIDER

01:45:39.566 --> 01:45:40.634
SHORTAGE AREA.

01:45:40.701 --> 01:45:42.335
WE GET A LOT OF HEALTH CARE

01:45:42.402 --> 01:45:45.806
PROVIDERS I COME FROM FAR AWAY.

01:45:45.872 --> 01:45:46.606
YOU KNOW WHEN WE THINK ABOUT WHO

01:45:46.673 --> 01:45:47.741
WOULD WANT TO COME TO THE STATE

01:45:47.808 --> 01:45:49.710
OF CALIFORNIA RIGHT --

01:45:49.776 --> 01:45:50.711
BUT UNFORTUNATELY WHAT THAT

01:45:50.777 --> 01:45:52.079
MEANS IS THEY OFTEN WEREN'T

01:45:52.145 --> 01:45:53.547
TRAINED ABOUT VALLEY FEVER THEY

01:45:53.613 --> 01:45:55.282
DON'T KNOW THAT THIS IS A

01:45:55.348 --> 01:45:57.350
CONCERN IN OUR COMMUNITY --

01:45:57.417 --> 01:45:57.951
AND THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO

01:45:58.018 --> 01:45:59.820
ABOUT IT.

01:45:59.886 --> 01:46:00.654
YOU KNOW THIS.

01:46:00.721 --> 01:46:01.988
IS HOW CURATORS ARE WONDERFUL

01:46:02.055 --> 01:46:03.290
WE'RE GLAD THEY'RE HERE TO SERVE

01:46:03.356 --> 01:46:04.691
OUR COMMUNITY --

01:46:04.758 --> 01:46:06.593
BUT WE WISH THAT THERE WAS A

01:46:06.660 --> 01:46:08.028
MECHANISM.

01:46:08.095 --> 01:46:09.262
TO BETTER EDUCATE THEM OR ENSURE

01:46:09.329 --> 01:46:10.430
THAT THEY WERE EDUCATED ABOUT

01:46:10.497 --> 01:46:11.832
VALLEY FEVER --

01:46:11.898 --> 01:46:16.002
IT CAN BE DIAGNOSED OR RULED.

01:46:16.069 --> 01:46:18.238
WHAT WE HOPE FOR IS THAT ALL THE

01:46:18.305 --> 01:46:18.972
PATIENTS EVERYONE IN OUR

01:46:19.039 --> 01:46:20.073
COMMUNITY --

01:46:20.140 --> 01:46:21.975
IS AFFORDED THE SAME LEVEL OF

01:46:22.042 --> 01:46:24.344
CARE -- IN

01:46:24.411 --> 01:46:25.412
PARTICULAR FOR DISEASE LIKE

01:46:25.479 --> 01:46:26.913
VALLEY FEVER THAT ARE JUST UNDER

01:46:26.980 --> 01:46:28.682
AN NOT WELL KNOWN --

01:46:28.749 --> 01:46:30.417
OUTSIDE OF THE AREAS WHERE IT'S

01:46:30.484 --> 01:46:32.586
PUBLIC.

01:46:32.652 --> 01:46:34.287
I'M AS MENTIONED VALLEY FEVER IS

01:46:34.354 --> 01:46:36.089
JUST ONE OF MORE THAN EIGHTY

01:46:36.156 --> 01:46:37.457
CONDITIONS THAT ARE REQUIRED TO

01:46:37.524 --> 01:46:38.825
REPORT THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT.

01:46:38.892 --> 01:46:40.327
AND IN MOST COUNTIES INCLUDING

01:46:40.393 --> 01:46:41.661
MINE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE

01:46:41.728 --> 01:46:42.963
RESPONSIBLE FOR INVESTIGATING BY

01:46:43.029 --> 01:46:45.332
FEVER ARE ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR

01:46:45.398 --> 01:46:47.334
DOZENS OF OTHER DISEASES.

01:46:47.400 --> 01:46:49.136
AND AS VALLEY FEARS HAVE AS LIKE

01:46:49.202 --> 01:46:51.438
YOUR CASES OF CONTINUE TO RISE.

01:46:51.505 --> 01:46:53.573
I COUNTY AFTER COUNTY HAS FOUND

01:46:53.640 --> 01:46:55.509
THAT THEY DO NOT HAVE THE

01:46:55.575 --> 01:46:56.109
RESOURCES TO FULLY INVESTIGATE

01:46:56.176 --> 01:46:57.077
THEM.

01:46:57.144 --> 01:46:58.612
BEGINNING JANUARY ONE OF THIS

01:46:58.678 --> 01:47:00.447
YEAR WE AS A STATE MOVED TO A

01:47:00.514 --> 01:47:02.415
CASE DEFINITION THAT DOES NOT

01:47:02.482 --> 01:47:04.384
REQUIRE --

01:47:04.451 --> 01:47:05.919
CASE PATIENT INTERVIEWS OR TO

01:47:05.986 --> 01:47:07.654
REVIEW MEDICAL RECORDS.

01:47:07.721 --> 01:47:09.022
AND THIS DECISION WAS MADE TO

01:47:09.089 --> 01:47:10.123
REDUCE THE BURDEN ON COUNTY

01:47:10.190 --> 01:47:11.525
HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND TO CREATE

01:47:11.591 --> 01:47:13.326
A UNIFORM A DEFINITION ACROSS

01:47:13.393 --> 01:47:14.928
THE STATE.

01:47:14.995 --> 01:47:17.164
BUT IN DOING SO WE KNOW THAT WE

01:47:17.230 --> 01:47:18.598
WILL NO LONGER HAVE ACCESS TO

01:47:18.665 --> 01:47:20.100
DETAILS ABOUT A PATIENT LIKE

01:47:20.167 --> 01:47:21.668
THEIR OCCUPATION THEIR SEVERITY

01:47:21.735 --> 01:47:23.537
OF ILLNESS WHETHER OR NOT THEY

01:47:23.603 --> 01:47:24.571
WERE HOSPITALIZED.

01:47:24.638 --> 01:47:26.072
WE KNOW THAT THIS WILL REDUCE

01:47:26.139 --> 01:47:27.641
OUR ABILITY TO DETECT OUTBREAKS

01:47:27.707 --> 01:47:29.476
OR DETERMINE IF EXPOSURES HAPPEN

01:47:29.543 --> 01:47:31.578
OUTSIDE OF THE COUNTY RESIDENTS.

01:47:31.645 --> 01:47:32.913
BUT COUNTY THROUGHOUT THE STATE

01:47:32.979 --> 01:47:34.314
FELT UNABLE TO KEEP UP WITH THE

01:47:34.381 --> 01:47:36.016
NUMBER OF CASES AND WE AS A

01:47:36.082 --> 01:47:37.551
STATE DECIDED THAT IT WAS MORE

01:47:37.617 --> 01:47:38.952
IMPORTANT TO ACCURATELY CAPTURE

01:47:39.019 --> 01:47:40.187
THE NUMBER OF CASES.

01:47:40.253 --> 01:47:42.656
IN TO KNOW EVERY DETAIL.

01:47:42.722 --> 01:47:43.890
IN AN IDEAL WORLD OF PUBLIC

01:47:43.957 --> 01:47:45.225
HEALTH WOOD WE INVESTIGATE

01:47:45.292 --> 01:47:47.460
EVERYONE OF THE NEARLY THREE

01:47:47.527 --> 01:47:48.061
THOUSAND CASES OF THE LIKE THE

01:47:48.128 --> 01:47:48.862
RING KERN COUNTY.

01:47:48.929 --> 01:47:50.096
ABSOLUTELY.

01:47:50.163 --> 01:47:51.531
THERE'S STILL SO MUCH WE HAVE TO

01:47:51.598 --> 01:47:53.166
LEARN ABOUT THIS DISEASE AND WHO

01:47:53.233 --> 01:47:55.202
TO FAX.

01:47:55.268 --> 01:47:56.036
I WANT TO KNOW WHAT WHAT

01:47:56.102 --> 01:47:57.971
PREDICTS A GOOD YEAR OR A BAD

01:47:58.038 --> 01:47:59.339
YEAR FOR VALLEY FEVER.

01:47:59.406 --> 01:48:00.207
I WANT TO BE ABLE TO BETTER

01:48:00.273 --> 01:48:02.676
EDUCATE PEOPLE SO THAT THEY KNOW

01:48:02.742 --> 01:48:04.177
HOW THEY CAN REDUCE THEIR RISKS.

01:48:04.244 --> 01:48:05.512
AND SO THEY KNOW THEY CAN SEEK

01:48:05.579 --> 01:48:07.280
MEDICAL CARE AND THAT WHEN THEY

01:48:07.347 --> 01:48:08.248
DO SEEK MEDICAL CARE THAT THEIR

01:48:08.315 --> 01:48:11.718
PROVIDER WILL TAKE CARE OF THEM.

01:48:11.785 --> 01:48:12.552
I WANT TO KNOW IF THERE'S A

01:48:12.619 --> 01:48:14.054
CLUSTER OF CASES SOMEWHERE SO WE

01:48:14.120 --> 01:48:15.255
CAN DETERMINE THE SOURCE OF

01:48:15.322 --> 01:48:18.124
EXPOSURE AND TAKES STEPS TO KEEP

01:48:18.191 --> 01:48:18.325
MORE.

01:48:18.391 --> 01:48:19.860
BEING INFECTED.

PREVALENCE OF THEM IN OUR

01:49:16.549 --> 01:49:17.918
THE BURDEN OF CHRONIC DISEASE IS

02:02:01.580 --> 02:02:03.182
WHAT'S THIS IF YOU HAD THE MAGIC

02:02:03.249 --> 02:02:05.351
WAND HOW DO WE GET ON THE FRONT

02:02:05.418 --> 02:02:09.755
END OF BETTER --

02:02:09.822 --> 02:02:12.425
PREVENTION OF THE THE IT'S A

02:02:12.491 --> 02:02:14.293
COMMUNICABLE DISEASE HAVE.

02:02:14.360 --> 02:02:15.594
EDUCATION BUT OFTEN WERE

02:02:15.661 --> 02:02:17.063
RETIREMENT ASSETS AT RISK

02:02:17.129 --> 02:02:18.364
COMMUNITIES.

02:02:18.431 --> 02:02:20.132
THE TRENDS ARE GOING UP WHAT

02:02:20.199 --> 02:02:20.833
ONLY.

02:02:20.900 --> 02:02:23.669
WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO REVERSE

02:02:23.736 --> 02:02:27.640
THE TRENDS?

02:02:27.707 --> 02:02:30.042
OF BOTH PROVIDERS AND COMMUNITY

02:02:30.109 --> 02:02:32.344
MEMBERS SO PROVIDERS ABOUT THE

02:02:32.411 --> 02:02:33.813
SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS

02:02:33.879 --> 02:02:35.214
HOW TO TREAT THEM HOW OFTEN YOU

02:02:35.281 --> 02:02:36.749
SHOULD BE SCREENING HOW TO TAKE

02:02:36.816 --> 02:02:38.884
A BASIC SEXUAL HISTORY FOR

02:02:38.951 --> 02:02:40.152
PATIENTS --

02:02:40.219 --> 02:02:41.454
SO I THINK THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL

02:02:41.520 --> 02:02:42.588
AND THEN I THINK THE COMMUNITY

02:02:42.655 --> 02:02:44.090
MEMBERS AS WELL --

02:02:44.156 --> 02:02:46.192
A LOT OF SIX SAID DOESN'T HAPPEN

02:02:46.258 --> 02:02:47.993
ANYMORE IN SCHOOLS SO KIND OF

02:02:48.060 --> 02:02:50.262
REINSTITUTING THAT AND BEING

02:02:50.329 --> 02:02:51.597
REALLY OPEN AND FRANK ABOUT

02:02:51.664 --> 02:02:52.932
SEXUAL PRACTICES AND HARM

02:02:52.998 --> 02:02:54.934
REDUCTION AND AND MAKING BETTER

02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:56.502
CHOICES --

02:02:56.569 --> 02:02:59.038
AND THEN HAVING ACCESS TESTING

02:02:59.105 --> 02:03:00.773
AND TREATMENT FACILITIES IS ALSO

02:03:00.840 --> 02:03:02.141
REALLY IMPORTANT.

02:03:02.208 --> 02:03:04.310
A LOT OF FOLKS THAT ARE GETTING

02:03:04.376 --> 02:03:06.946
SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS

02:03:07.012 --> 02:03:08.047
HAVE -- ARE

02:03:08.114 --> 02:03:09.815
EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS AND

02:03:09.882 --> 02:03:11.383
HAVE POOR EDUCATIONAL

02:03:11.450 --> 02:03:13.319
OPPORTUNITIES AND JOBS --

02:03:13.385 --> 02:03:14.954
AND SO I THINK LOOKING AT THAT

02:03:15.020 --> 02:03:17.089
IS ALSO VERY IMPORTANT --

02:03:17.156 --> 02:03:19.525
AND HAVING REALLY GOOD REFERRAL

02:03:19.592 --> 02:03:20.860
SYSTEMS IN PLACE WHEN YOU ARE

02:03:20.926 --> 02:03:22.361
CHALLENGED WITH THOSE THINGS

02:03:22.428 --> 02:03:25.765
WILL BE IF THERE ARE WERE READY --

02:03:25.831 --> 02:03:26.732
TO DEAL WITH THEIR THEIR

02:03:26.799 --> 02:03:27.833
SUBSTANCE USE FOR INSTANCE

02:03:27.900 --> 02:03:29.335
HAVING SOMEWHERE RIGHT NOW THAT

02:03:29.401 --> 02:03:30.703
WE COULD --

02:03:30.770 --> 02:03:32.271
GET THEM TO I THINK THOSE ARE

02:03:32.338 --> 02:03:34.073
THE THINGS HAVING HOUSING RIGHT

02:03:34.140 --> 02:03:35.775
NOW THAT WE COULD HELP THEM WITH

02:03:35.841 --> 02:03:37.810
I THINK WOULD BE HELPFUL.

02:03:37.877 --> 02:03:38.644
THANK YOU IN.

02:03:38.711 --> 02:03:40.279

FROM A GOVERNMENT POINT OF VIEW --

02:05:40.132 --> 02:05:43.636

TO OFFSET SOME OF THOSE FEARS

02:05:45.604 --> 02:05:49.141

WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THOSE PEOPLE

02:09:50.983 --> 02:09:53.752
EVENTUALLY BECOME DIABETIC.

02:09:53.819 --> 02:09:55.554

TO SO SO SO SO THAT'S THAT'S

02:10:03.162 --> 02:10:04.696
VERY EXPENSIVE RIGHT AND WE KNOW

02:10:04.763 --> 02:10:05.931
THERE'S INTERVENTIONS LIKE THE

02:10:05.998 --> 02:10:07.566
DIABETES PREVENTION PROGRAM

02:10:07.633 --> 02:10:10.402
WHERE WE HAVE THEM SEE --

02:10:10.469 --> 02:10:11.403
DIETITIANS --

02:10:11.470 --> 02:10:13.038
THAT CAN ACTUALLY REDUCE THAT BY

02:10:13.105 --> 02:10:15.440
ABOUT HALF --

02:10:15.507 --> 02:10:18.343
SO EIGHT EIGHT EIGHT AGAIN AND-AND THE OTHER I THINK I REALLY

02:10:18.410 --> 02:10:20.212
APPRECIATE THAT WHAT YOU SAID IS

02:10:20.279 --> 02:10:22.214
IS THAT WHEN IT COMES.

02:10:22.281 --> 02:10:24.950
TO CHRONIC DISEASES LIKE OKAY

02:10:25.017 --> 02:10:27.152
CHRONIC DISEASES --

02:10:27.219 --> 02:10:29.087
MAN THAT NOT AS URGENT WE TALK

02:10:29.154 --> 02:10:30.088
ABOUT WHEN I SAY NOT ESSENTIAL

02:10:30.155 --> 02:10:32.157
IS IT NOT AS URGENT AS PERHAPS

02:10:32.224 --> 02:10:35.894
AN OUTBREAK GOING ON AND SO WE I

02:10:35.961 --> 02:10:38.297
HEARD THAT VENTURE NURSES --

02:10:38.363 --> 02:10:39.898
OF THE HEPATITIS A OUTBREAK WE

02:10:39.965 --> 02:10:41.533
HEARD FROM THE LA.

02:10:41.600 --> 02:10:43.168
I COUNTY AS WELL THAT HAPPENED --

02:10:43.235 --> 02:10:44.169
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THE

02:10:44.236 --> 02:10:45.737
CHRONIC CONDITIONS STOP WENT

02:10:45.804 --> 02:10:47.339
AWAY IT JUST MEANS THAT PEOPLE

02:10:47.406 --> 02:10:48.840
ARE GETTING HELP AND I WOULD

02:10:48.907 --> 02:10:50.042
POINT OUT WE HAD A PREVIOUS

02:10:50.108 --> 02:10:51.443
HEARING WE TALKED ABOUT THE FACT

02:10:51.510 --> 02:10:52.844
THAT 40% OF CALIFORNIANS AT

02:10:52.911 --> 02:10:54.646
LEAST ONE CRY CONDITION THAT

02:10:54.713 --> 02:10:56.348
7280% OF OUR HEALTH.

02:10:56.415 --> 02:10:58.650
CARE COSTS.

02:10:58.717 --> 02:10:59.551
RIGHT SO WE'RE SPENDING WHAT

02:10:59.618 --> 02:11:01.320
PERCENTAGE OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND

02:11:01.386 --> 02:11:05.724
WE'RE SPENDING 70%. 7280% ON A

02:11:05.791 --> 02:11:07.960
HEALTHCARE SPENDING ON THE

02:11:08.026 --> 02:11:10.128
CONSEQUENCE OF THAT NOT DOING

02:11:10.195 --> 02:11:13.232
THE PREVENTION RIGHT RIGHT SO --

02:11:13.298 --> 02:11:13.799
WHEN WE START TALKING ABOUT

02:11:13.865 --> 02:11:16.134
BUDGETS AND TALKING ABOUT THINGS

02:11:16.201 --> 02:11:18.904
WHAT HAPPENS WE DON'T DO THINGS --

02:11:18.971 --> 02:11:20.505
AND IT WOULD IT HELP IF I MAY

02:11:20.572 --> 02:11:22.241
IT'S GOING TO TAKE INVESTMENT ON

02:11:22.307 --> 02:11:23.709
BOTH ENDS RIGHT OBVIOUSLY WE

02:11:23.775 --> 02:11:24.543
HAVE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE

02:11:24.610 --> 02:11:26.612
EXPERIENCING CHRONIC CONDITIONS

02:11:26.678 --> 02:11:28.347
NOW THAT WE STILL HAVE TO CARE.

02:11:28.413 --> 02:11:29.047
FOR SO WE STILL HAVE TO KEEP

02:11:29.114 --> 02:11:30.549
INVESTING IN THAT LINE BUT WE

02:11:30.616 --> 02:11:31.717
ALSO NEED TO INVEST IN THE

02:11:31.783 --> 02:11:33.051
PREVENTION MORE HEAVILY SO THAT

02:11:33.118 --> 02:11:34.119
HOPEFULLY.

02:11:34.186 --> 02:11:35.787
YEARS FROM NOW.

02:11:35.854 --> 02:11:37.856
IT'S MORE BALANCED AND WE ARE

02:11:37.923 --> 02:11:39.091
ACTUALLY GETTING PEOPLE.

02:11:39.157 --> 02:11:40.559
TO IT LIVING COMMUNITIES THAT

02:11:40.626 --> 02:11:42.127
ACTUALLY PROMOTE WELL BEING AND

02:11:42.194 --> 02:11:43.495
THAT ACTUALLY ENCOURAGE THEM TO

02:11:43.562 --> 02:11:46.064
WALK FROM HOME TO SCHOOL BECAUSE

02:11:46.131 --> 02:11:47.466
THEY LIVE IN A SAFE COMMUNITY

02:11:47.532 --> 02:11:49.234
AND AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO

02:11:49.301 --> 02:11:50.602
INVEST HEAVILY ON THAT

02:11:50.669 --> 02:11:52.104
PREVENTION SIDE IF I OR ELSE

02:11:52.170 --> 02:11:53.205
WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO

02:11:53.272 --> 02:11:54.506
EXPERIENCE THE HIGH.

02:11:54.573 --> 02:11:55.807

02:12:00.679 --> 02:12:03.181
SURPLUS.

02:12:03.248 --> 02:12:04.516
I THINK MOST PEOPLE THINK THAT

02:12:04.583 --> 02:12:07.319
WHEN WE WITH THE VICTORIAN ERA.

02:12:07.386 --> 02:12:09.655
RIGHT NOW WE HAVE A MULTI DRUG

02:12:09.721 --> 02:12:11.657
RESISTANT GONORRHEA.

02:12:11.723 --> 02:12:12.891
BY THE WAY YOU JUST TOLD ME THAT

02:12:12.958 --> 02:12:14.426
BECAUSE THE SURPLUS YOU DON'T

ANYMORE.

02:12:17.829 --> 02:12:20.065
THEY REALLY DO SURPLUS.

02:12:20.132 --> 02:12:21.633
AND I WILL SAY YES TO ANSWER ONE

02:12:21.700 --> 02:12:23.502
OF THE QUESTIONS YOU ASK BEFORE --

02:12:23.568 --> 02:12:25.137
THAT STD CONTROL BRANCH I

02:12:25.203 --> 02:12:26.438

WAS THE LEAD BUT THEY'VE DONE

02:12:29.074 --> 02:12:30.275
AROUND STD --

02:12:30.342 --> 02:12:33.178
WORK FOR SO I CAN'T TELL YOU.

02:12:33.245 --> 02:12:34.079
FOR THE CITY OF LONG BEACH WE

02:12:34.146 --> 02:12:35.414

02:12:35.480 --> 02:12:37.049
INVESTIGATORS --

ASK IF ANY PLANNED PARENTHOOD WE

02:12:59.805 --> 02:13:00.572

02:13:00.639 --> 02:13:01.707
WE HAVE THE NEW THE TRUMP

02:13:01.773 --> 02:13:04.910
ADMINISTRATION TRYING TO CUT OUT

02:13:04.976 --> 02:13:05.510
CUT PLANNED PARENTHOOD BY THE

02:13:05.577 --> 02:13:06.311
KNEES.

02:13:06.378 --> 02:13:07.012
I CERTAINLY I THINK YOU'RE IN

02:13:07.079 --> 02:13:07.646
THE STATE WILL WE WON'T ALLOW

02:13:07.713 --> 02:13:08.914
THEM TO HAVE TO CLOSE ALL THE

02:13:08.980 --> 02:13:10.315
CLINICS BUT IF.

02:13:10.382 --> 02:13:12.384
THAT CAPACITY ONE AWAY WHAT

02:13:12.451 --> 02:13:14.519
WOULD HAPPEN THAT. TO YOUR

02:13:14.586 --> 02:13:15.554
HEATH DEPARTMENT IF SUDDENLY

02:13:15.620 --> 02:13:17.923
ALL THE ALL THE CAPACITY OF

02:13:17.989 --> 02:13:18.824
PLANNED PARENTHOOD SAID WHAT

02:13:18.890 --> 02:13:20.425
SORRY WE DON'T HAVE THE MONEY

02:13:20.492 --> 02:13:22.060
WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE THAT WE'RE

WE'RE SHUTTING THAT OFF.

02:13:23.028 --> 02:13:25.330
WHAT WHAT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN --

02:13:25.397 --> 02:13:27.699
FOR LONG BEACH OUR RELATIONSHIP

02:13:27.766 --> 02:13:28.333
WITH PLANNED PARENTHOOD IFTHEY

02:13:28.400 --> 02:13:30.936
SEE ON MANY OF THE PATIENTS AND

02:13:31.002 --> 02:13:31.603
THEN -- IF

02:13:31.670 --> 02:13:33.004
THEY'RE POSITIVE AND THEY GET

02:13:33.071 --> 02:13:34.172
SENT TO THE HOME.

02:13:34.239 --> 02:13:35.941
SO I THINK THEY WOULD JUST COME

02:13:36.007 --> 02:13:36.842
DIRECTLY TO THE HEALTH

02:13:36.908 --> 02:13:39.010

IT WOULD BE.

02:13:41.513 --> 02:13:42.914
IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT I I THINK

02:13:42.981 --> 02:13:46.451
WE ALL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS ARE

02:13:46.518 --> 02:13:47.986

VERY DIFFICULT TO FIND --

02:13:51.456 --> 02:13:53.291
BUT IT IS I THINK YOU KNOW KIND

02:13:53.358 --> 02:13:56.261
OF A CORNERSTONE OF STD CONTROL --

02:13:56.328 --> 02:13:58.029
TO BE ABLE TO GET PATIENTS IN

02:16:53.805 --> 02:16:54.472
I THINK --

02:16:54.539 --> 02:16:54.973
SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY

02:16:55.040 --> 02:16:57.943
IMPORTANT TO NOTE IS THAT AS ONE

02:16:58.009 --> 02:16:59.444

02:16:59.511 --> 02:17:00.278
REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH ON THE

02:17:00.345 --> 02:17:01.112
GROUND.

02:17:01.179 --> 02:17:02.814
WE HAVE THE CAPACITY TO COLLECT

02:17:02.881 --> 02:17:04.482
A LARGE AMOUNT OF DATA --

02:17:04.549 --> 02:17:05.684
WHEN WE ARE FACING EPIDEMICS

02:17:05.750 --> 02:17:06.818
SUCH AS THE?

02:17:06.885 --> 02:17:07.986
AND IT WAS THE INFORMAL

02:17:08.053 --> 02:17:10.188
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE CALIFORNIA

02:17:10.255 --> 02:17:11.289
DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND

02:17:11.356 --> 02:17:12.457
COMPARED AMANTE THAT REALLY

02:17:12.524 --> 02:17:14.292
STARTED THE WORK.

02:17:14.359 --> 02:17:15.794
OF US CHANGING --

02:17:15.860 --> 02:17:17.562

02:17:17.629 --> 02:17:18.563
SYPHILIS.

02:17:18.630 --> 02:17:19.331
AND I THINK THAT THAT'S

02:17:19.397 --> 02:17:20.832
SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD THINK

02:17:20.899 --> 02:17:21.766
ABOUT MORE --

02:17:21.833 --> 02:17:23.568
AND IF THERE IS AN OPTION FOR US

02:17:23.635 --> 02:17:24.536
TO BE MORE INNOVATIVE AND

02:17:24.603 --> 02:17:26.805
FORMALIZE THOSE RELATIONSHIPS --

02:17:26.871 --> 02:17:28.173
BECAUSE WE SEE THE PATIENTS WE

02:17:28.239 --> 02:17:29.374
HAVE THE DATA --

02:17:29.441 --> 02:17:30.875
AND CAN WE NEED TO KIND OF WORK

02:17:30.942 --> 02:17:32.811
MORE FORMALLY WITH OUR LOCAL AND

02:17:32.877 --> 02:17:34.379
STATE PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS

02:17:34.446 --> 02:17:35.280
TO MAKE AN IMPACT BECAUSE I

02:17:35.347 --> 02:17:35.780
THINK.

02:17:35.847 --> 02:17:36.948
IN SOME OF THESE AREAS LIKE

02:17:37.015 --> 02:17:38.350
CONGENITAL SYPHILIS --

02:17:38.416 --> 02:17:39.718
AN EPIDEMIC WE DON'T ALWAYS

02:17:39.784 --> 02:17:41.319
UNDERSTAND EXACTLY WHAT IS

02:17:41.386 --> 02:17:42.721
CAUSING IT WE CAN DERIVE ALL

02:17:42.787 --> 02:17:44.589
THESE ISSUES WITH HOMELESSNESS --

02:17:44.656 --> 02:17:46.558
AND DRUG USE BUT IT'S ALSO ABOUT

02:17:46.625 --> 02:17:48.326
COLLECTING DATA TO SAY WHAT'S

02:17:48.393 --> 02:17:49.194

02:17:57.736 --> 02:17:59.270

GUIDELINES THAT ARE IN DRAFT

02:18:01.706 --> 02:18:02.707
FORM SO HOPEFULLY LATER THIS

02:18:02.774 --> 02:18:04.109
YEAR THEY'LL BE ADDRESSING SOME

02:18:04.175 --> 02:18:05.543

DOCTORS TO PRACTITIONERS ANY

02:21:18.069 --> 02:21:20.638
KIND OF PROVIDER AND TO TELL

02:21:20.705 --> 02:21:21.873
ABOUT THE IF YOU WERE GIVEN THE

02:21:21.940 --> 02:21:23.675
OPPORTUNITY ASK QUESTIONS TO

02:21:23.741 --> 02:21:24.509
KIND OF CREATE THAT RESOURCE

02:21:24.576 --> 02:21:25.910
BASE SO THAT --

02:21:25.977 --> 02:21:28.112
IF THEY NEED TO DISCUSS

02:21:28.179 --> 02:21:28.913
TREATMENTS --

02:21:28.980 --> 02:21:30.648
THAT THEY HAVE A POSITION TO

02:21:30.715 --> 02:21:32.050
HELP THEM WITH THAT --

02:21:32.116 --> 02:21:34.552
AND SO IT'S IT'S KIND OF A LONG

02:21:34.619 --> 02:21:35.587
TIME COMING AND WE'RE WE'RE GLAD

02:21:35.653 --> 02:21:36.788
THAT THIS IS THE RELATIONSHIP IS

02:21:36.855 --> 02:21:39.557
DEVELOPING AND SO WE HOPE TO

02:21:39.624 --> 02:21:40.058
CONTINUE TO REACH THEM.

02:21:40.124 --> 02:21:42.126
AND YOU KNOW THE THE TRICKIEST

02:21:42.193 --> 02:21:44.762
PART IS THAT WE DON'T CONTROL

02:21:44.829 --> 02:21:45.930
THE PRIZE THAT COME IN --

02:21:45.997 --> 02:21:47.532
AND IF THEY ARE IN LARGE CLINIC

02:21:47.599 --> 02:21:49.000
GROUPS USUALLY THERE'S KIND OF

02:21:49.067 --> 02:21:50.335
THAT SUPPORT SYSTEM TO HELP THEM

02:21:50.401 --> 02:21:51.469
BUT WHEN THEY COME IN AS A

02:21:51.536 --> 02:21:52.637
PRIVATE PROVIDER OPEN THEIR NEW

02:21:52.704 --> 02:21:53.638
PRACTICE --

02:21:53.705 --> 02:21:55.039
IF THEY DON'T KNOW ABOUT IT THEY

02:21:55.106 --> 02:21:56.140
DON'T KNOW ABOUT IT.

02:21:56.207 --> 02:21:56.908
WE OBVIOUSLY DON'T HAVE THE

02:21:56.975 --> 02:21:58.376
CAPACITY TO GO OUT ONE ON ONE TO

02:21:58.443 --> 02:21:59.844

I KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS WE GET A

02:22:05.817 --> 02:22:07.252
LOT OF QUESTIONS SOMETIMES ABOUT

02:22:07.318 --> 02:22:08.353

PATIENT'S DIAGNOSIS IF THEY NEED

02:22:11.022 --> 02:22:11.589
TREATMENT OR NOT --

02:22:11.656 --> 02:22:12.790
AND USUALLY HAS TO GET REFERRED

02:22:12.857 --> 02:22:14.859
TO A MEDICAL DOCTOR --

02:22:14.926 --> 02:22:16.094

BETTER EDUCATION --

02:22:20.131 --> 02:22:22.967
AND AND WE KNOW THAT THERE'S A

02:22:23.034 --> 02:22:24.435
NUMBER OF CLINICAL STUDIES

02:22:24.502 --> 02:22:25.403

TREATMENT OF PATIENTS BUT WE'RE

02:23:55.493 --> 02:23:56.828

02:24:04.235 --> 02:24:05.670

02:24:13.244 --> 02:24:14.145
KIND OF COMMON SENSE ANSWERS

02:24:14.212 --> 02:24:15.980

02:24:29.727 --> 02:24:30.695

02:26:49.300 --> 02:26:50.835
REALIGNMENT.

02:26:50.902 --> 02:26:52.303
A REAL SORT OF RECENTLY THE

02:26:52.370 --> 02:26:53.804
CALIFORNIA HEALTH EXECUTIVES

02:26:53.871 --> 02:26:55.873
ASSOCIATION COMPARED LOCAL

02:26:55.940 --> 02:26:57.542
ASSISTANCE FUNDING MADE

02:26:57.608 --> 02:26:58.743
AVAILABLE TO LOCAL HEALTH

02:26:58.809 --> 02:27:02.480
DEPARTMENTS. TO AS FAR BACK AS

02:27:02.547 --> 02:27:06.350
200-072-0008. TO CURRENT TO

02:27:06.417 --> 02:27:07.018
EIGHTEEN TO NINETEEN WE CHOSE TO

02:27:07.084 --> 02:27:09.387
USE THE200-072-0008 AS A BASS

02:27:09.453 --> 02:27:11.088
LINE BECAUSE IT REPRESENTS THE

02:27:11.155 --> 02:27:13.057
TIME IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO THE

02:27:13.124 --> 02:27:14.225
GREAT RECESSION.

02:27:14.292 --> 02:27:16.027
AND I THINK WHAT YOU WILL SOON

02:27:16.093 --> 02:27:18.429
SEE AS UP THE FUNDING FOR LOCAL

02:27:18.496 --> 02:27:19.330
HEALTH DEPARTMENT SINCE THAT

02:27:19.397 --> 02:27:22.767
TIME HAS NEVER TRULY RECOVERED.

02:27:22.833 --> 02:27:25.369
IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN

02:27:25.436 --> 02:27:25.836
NINETEEN LOCAL HEALTH

02:27:25.903 --> 02:27:26.737
DEPARTMENTS WERE BUDGETED TO

02:27:26.804 --> 02:27:30.308
RECEIVE ROUGHLY ONE HUNDRED AND

02:27:30.374 --> 02:27:31.909
SEVENTY SEVEN MILLION IN TOTAL

02:27:31.976 --> 02:27:33.110
FUNDS LESS.

02:27:33.177 --> 02:27:35.546
THAN OUR TWO THOUSAND TWO

02:27:35.613 --> 02:27:37.114
THOUSAND EIGHT BUDGETS.

02:27:37.181 --> 02:27:38.950
IT SHOULD BE NOTED THOUGH THAT

02:27:39.016 --> 02:27:39.917
THIS NOT AMOUNT ACTUALLY

02:27:39.984 --> 02:27:42.320
INCLUDES INCREASES AND FEDERAL

02:27:42.386 --> 02:27:44.555
AND SPECIAL FUNDS SO ULTIMATELY

02:27:44.622 --> 02:27:46.524
THE NET DECREASE IS THE RESULT

02:27:46.591 --> 02:27:48.359
OF A TOTAL DECREASE OF STATE

02:27:48.426 --> 02:27:49.860
GENERAL FUNDING.

02:27:49.927 --> 02:27:51.062
IN THE AMOUNT OF NINETY MILLION

02:27:51.128 --> 02:27:53.364
DOLLARS. FOR THE PURPOSES OF

02:27:53.431 --> 02:27:54.665
THIS HEARING I'D LIKE TO

02:27:54.732 --> 02:27:56.701
HIGHLIGHT THREE KEY AREAS OF

02:27:56.767 --> 02:27:57.768
FUNDING.

02:27:57.835 --> 02:27:58.903
AT THE FIRST IS AROUND

02:27:58.970 --> 02:28:00.238
INFECTIOUS DISEASE CONTROL WHICH

02:28:00.304 --> 02:28:02.840
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT.

02:28:02.907 --> 02:28:04.308
INFECTIOUS DISEASE CONTROL IS

02:28:04.375 --> 02:28:05.910
BUDGETED TO RECEIVE THIRTY EIGHT

02:28:05.977 --> 02:28:07.979
MILLION MORE.

02:28:08.045 --> 02:28:10.081
IN FUNDING BUT WHEN YOU EXCLUDE

02:28:10.147 --> 02:28:11.616
THE CATEGORICAL FUNDING AS WE'VE

02:28:11.682 --> 02:28:13.217
TALKED ABOUT RELATED TO HIV AND

02:28:13.284 --> 02:28:14.518
AIDS.

02:28:14.585 --> 02:28:16.187
THE ACTUAL FUNDING THAT LOCAL

02:28:16.254 --> 02:28:17.588
HEALTH DEPARTMENTS WILL GET.

02:28:17.655 --> 02:28:19.290
WILL BE EIGHT AND A HALF MILLION

02:28:19.357 --> 02:28:21.025
DOLLARS LESS THAN WHAT THEY

02:28:21.092 --> 02:28:24.528
RECEIVED IN 200-072-0008.

02:28:24.595 --> 02:28:26.330
CHRONIC DISEASE PREVENTION IS

02:28:26.397 --> 02:28:28.532
BUDGETED TO RECEIVE TWENTY SIX

02:28:28.599 --> 02:28:30.901
POINT FOUR MILLION MORE.

02:28:30.968 --> 02:28:31.769
ULTIMATELY THOUGH WHEN YOU

02:28:31.836 --> 02:28:33.838
REMOVE THE DRAMATIC CURRENT

02:28:33.904 --> 02:28:35.606
INCREASES AND TOBACCO FUNDING.

02:28:35.673 --> 02:28:37.074
LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS WILL

02:28:37.141 --> 02:28:39.477
RECEIVE FIFTEEN POINT FOUR

02:28:39.543 --> 02:28:41.279
MILLION DOLLARS LESS THAN WHAT

02:28:41.345 --> 02:28:45.116
THEY RECEIVED IN 200-072-0008.

02:28:45.182 --> 02:28:46.617
AND FOR EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS

02:28:46.684 --> 02:28:47.918
LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS ARE

02:28:47.985 --> 02:28:50.121
BUDGETED TO RECEIVE TEN POINT

02:28:50.187 --> 02:28:51.422
SEVEN MILLION LESS THAN WHAT

02:28:51.489 --> 02:28:54.992
THEY RECEIVED IN 200-072-0008.

02:28:55.059 --> 02:28:56.894
I THINK AS YOU HEARD OF MUCH OF

02:28:56.961 --> 02:28:58.095
THE FUNDING THAT WE RECEIVE AT

02:28:58.162 --> 02:28:59.864
THE LOCAL LEVEL IS CATEGORICAL

02:28:59.930 --> 02:29:00.898
FUNDING --

02:29:00.965 --> 02:29:02.833
AND ULTIMATELY IS INFLEXIBLE AND

02:29:02.900 --> 02:29:04.435
CANNOT BE SHIFTED FOR OTHER

02:29:04.502 --> 02:29:06.003
PURPOSES.

02:29:06.070 --> 02:29:07.772
SO THOUGH IN MANY INSTANCES WHAT

02:29:07.838 --> 02:29:09.807
YOU MAY SEE ARE ACTUALLY LOCAL

02:29:09.874 --> 02:29:11.475
HEALTH DEPARTMENT BUDGETS IN

02:29:11.542 --> 02:29:13.411
TOTAL INCREASING THAT'S THE

02:29:13.477 --> 02:29:17.014
RESULT OF CATEGORICAL FUNDING.

02:29:17.081 --> 02:29:19.216
OFTEN THE FUNDING IS ALSO SO

02:29:19.283 --> 02:29:21.118
PRESCRIPTIVE IN NATURE THAT IT

02:29:21.185 --> 02:29:22.620
DOES NOT ALLOW US TO EITHER

02:29:22.687 --> 02:29:24.722
SUPPORT OR EXPAND OUR ABILITY TO

02:29:24.789 --> 02:29:25.656
PERFORM ANY OF OUR CORE

02:29:25.723 --> 02:29:26.691
FUNCTIONS.

02:29:26.757 --> 02:29:28.759
NOR DOES IT ALLOW US TO SUPPORT

02:29:28.826 --> 02:29:31.295
ANY OF OUR CORE INFRASTRUCTURE.

02:29:31.362 --> 02:29:33.464
ALTERNATIVELY HOWEVER NINETEEN

02:29:33.531 --> 02:29:34.932
NINETY ONE HEALTH REALIGNMENT IS

02:29:34.999 --> 02:29:36.167
SEEN BY LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT

02:29:36.233 --> 02:29:38.002
AT THAT FLEXIBLE SOURCE.

02:29:38.069 --> 02:29:39.403
AND CONSEQUENTLY ENDS UP BEING

02:29:39.470 --> 02:29:41.572
EITHER THE PRIMARY OR SOLE

02:29:41.639 --> 02:29:42.807
SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR US TO

02:29:42.873 --> 02:29:44.375
PERFORM MANY OF OUR CORE

02:29:44.442 --> 02:29:45.676
&lt;c.cyan&gt;UNCTIONS ARE SUPPORT OUR&lt;/c&gt;

02:29:45.743 --> 02:29:47.378
INFRASTRUCTURE.

02:29:47.445 --> 02:29:48.879
YET IN COMPARISON WITH ALL OF

02:29:48.946 --> 02:29:50.881
THE DRAMATIC INCREASES YOU'VE

02:29:50.948 --> 02:29:52.883
SEEN IN CATEGORICAL FUNDING.

02:29:52.950 --> 02:29:54.485
CURRENT NINETEEN NINETY ONE

02:29:54.552 --> 02:29:56.087
HEALTH REALIGNMENT FUNDING IS

02:29:56.153 --> 02:29:58.289
OVER ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS

02:29:58.356 --> 02:30:02.493
LESS THAN IT WAS IN 200-072-0008.

02:30:02.560 --> 02:30:03.894
AND LASTLY.

02:30:03.961 --> 02:30:06.297
IT CERTAINLY IN RECENT YEARS

02:30:06.364 --> 02:30:06.831
NINETEEN NINETY ONE HEALTH

02:30:06.897 --> 02:30:08.532
REALIGNMENT FUNDING HAS SEEN A

02:30:08.599 --> 02:30:10.368
LOT OF DIVERSIONS TO HELP FUND

02:30:10.434 --> 02:30:12.870
OTHER PRIORITY AREAS. FOR

02:30:12.937 --> 02:30:14.004
EXAMPLE IN SAMBHAR DINO COUNTY

02:30:14.071 --> 02:30:15.039
WHERE I'M FROM.

02:30:15.106 --> 02:30:17.041
OUR TOTAL NINETY ONE REALIGNMENT

02:30:17.108 --> 02:30:19.844
DOLLARS FOR SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN

02:30:19.910 --> 02:30:21.445
WAS ROUGHLY FIVE MILLION LESS

02:30:21.512 --> 02:30:22.546
THAN WHAT RECEIVE WHAT WE

02:30:22.613 --> 02:30:25.383
RECEIVED IN 200-072-0008.

02:30:25.449 --> 02:30:26.684
AND I KNOW OVERALL THOUGH THAT

02:30:26.751 --> 02:30:28.319
MAY NOT SEEM LIKE A VERY LARGE

02:30:28.386 --> 02:30:29.120
NUMBER.

02:30:29.186 --> 02:30:31.055
OF THAT ACTUALLY REPRESENTS 9%

02:30:31.122 --> 02:30:32.623
OF OUR TOTAL.

02:30:32.690 --> 02:30:34.792
CONVERSELY OUR POPULATION

02:30:34.859 --> 02:30:37.795
INCREASED BY 7% DURING THAT SAME

02:30:37.862 --> 02:30:40.131
TIME PERIOD.

02:30:40.197 --> 02:30:41.399
ULTIMATELY THE INVESTMENT OF

02:30:41.465 --> 02:30:43.100
STATE DOLLARS TOWARDS BROAD

02:30:43.167 --> 02:30:45.169
COMMUNICABLE DISEASE CONTROL HAS

02:30:45.236 --> 02:30:47.104
DRAMATICALLY DIMINISHED.

02:30:47.171 --> 02:30:49.373
WITH VERY LITTLE **** FUNDING

02:30:49.440 --> 02:30:50.674
COMING FROM THE STATE.

02:30:50.741 --> 02:30:52.209
LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS LIKE

02:30:52.276 --> 02:30:54.078
MINE HAVE LOOKED TO HEALTH

02:30:54.145 --> 02:30:55.513
REALIGNMENT TO HELP.

02:30:55.579 --> 02:30:57.915
BACK FILL ALL OF THOSE NEEDS.

02:30:57.982 --> 02:30:59.884
HOWEVER OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE

02:30:59.950 --> 02:31:01.685
TO DO SO HAS BEEN STYMIED BY THE

02:31:01.752 --> 02:31:04.688
FUNDS JUST ABSOLUTE INABILITY TO

02:31:04.755 --> 02:31:06.490
RECOVER FROM THE RECESSION --

02:31:06.557 --> 02:31:08.492
AND IS EVEN MORE SO BECAUSE OF

02:31:08.559 --> 02:31:10.127
THE CURRENT DIVERSIONS OF HEALTH

02:31:10.194 --> 02:31:12.096
REALIGNMENT.

02:31:12.163 --> 02:31:13.731
AND AS OF LATE THE COMMUNICATIVE

02:31:13.798 --> 02:31:15.499
THESE ISSUES THAT WE'VE BEEN

02:31:15.566 --> 02:31:16.534
TALKING ABOUT.

02:31:16.600 --> 02:31:17.968
HAVE BEEN COMPOUNDED BY OTHER

02:31:18.035 --> 02:31:21.272
SOCIAL ISSUES THAT ALSO REQUIRE

02:31:21.338 --> 02:31:22.339
RESOURCES LIKE TO HAVE A BY A

02:31:22.406 --> 02:31:23.374
BREAK IN OUR HOMELESS

02:31:23.441 --> 02:31:25.910
POPULATIONS.

02:31:25.976 --> 02:31:27.912
FINALLY AND I'D BE REMISS IF I

02:31:27.978 --> 02:31:31.582
DIDN'T EXPRESS SOME APPRECIATION

02:31:31.649 --> 02:31:33.484
FOR THE INCREMENTAL FUNNY THAT

02:31:33.551 --> 02:31:34.218
WE'VE SEEN.

02:31:34.285 --> 02:31:34.518
AS OF LATE.

02:31:34.585 --> 02:31:38.622
AND CERTAINLY WE WILL --

02:31:38.689 --> 02:31:40.658
BUT ULTIMATELY WHAT WE NEED IS

02:31:40.724 --> 02:31:41.525
FUNDING THAT IS ONGOING

02:31:41.592 --> 02:31:43.794
SUSTAINABLE.

02:31:43.861 --> 02:31:45.496
AND FLEXIBLE THE ONE TIME

02:31:45.563 --> 02:31:46.964
ALLOCATIONS OF FUNDING

02:31:47.031 --> 02:31:48.966
ULTIMATELY JUST ALLOW US TO DO

02:31:49.033 --> 02:31:50.367
ONE TIME ACTIVITIES.

02:31:50.434 --> 02:31:52.269
IT ALLOWED US TO PURCHASE A SOME

02:31:52.336 --> 02:31:53.971
ADDITIONAL SUPPLIES AND TO DO

02:31:54.038 --> 02:31:55.372
SOME EXPANDED OUTREACH AND

02:31:55.439 --> 02:31:57.174
EDUCATION BUT AGAIN IT WAS

02:31:57.241 --> 02:31:58.976
LIMITED AND FUNDING WHAT IT DID

02:31:59.043 --> 02:32:01.312
NOT ALLOW ME TO DO WHAT HIGHER

02:32:01.378 --> 02:32:03.447
CRITICAL STAFFING THAT I NEEDED.

02:32:03.514 --> 02:32:05.683
TO SCREEN TO TEST TO INVESTIGATE

02:32:05.749 --> 02:32:06.984
AND TO TREAT THE RISING

02:32:07.051 --> 02:32:08.886
CASELOADS WHAT I SEE ON MY DESK

02:32:08.953 --> 02:32:10.287
EVERY DAY.

02:32:10.354 --> 02:32:11.922
AND IT CERTAINLY ISN'T DOING

02:32:11.989 --> 02:32:13.891
ANYTHING TO HELP SUPPORT OUR

02:32:13.958 --> 02:32:16.160
INFRASTRUCTURE NOR IS IT HELPING

02:32:16.227 --> 02:32:17.728
US TO SUPPORT --

02:32:17.795 --> 02:32:20.331
AND IT FROM AN INFRASTRUCTURE

02:32:20.397 --> 02:32:21.832
THAT COULD ADEQUATELY ADDRESS.

02:32:21.899 --> 02:32:23.767
ANY OF THE EMERGENT INFECTIOUS

02:32:23.834 --> 02:32:25.703
DISEASES THAT WE'RE SEEING TODAY.

02:32:25.769 --> 02:32:27.438
SO I WANT TO EXPRESS MY

02:32:27.505 --> 02:32:29.406
APPRECIATION FOR EXAMINING THE

02:32:29.473 --> 02:32:30.241
PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE

02:32:30.307 --> 02:32:30.975
TODAY.

02:32:31.041 --> 02:32:32.543
AND HOPING HOPE THAT YOU'LL

02:32:32.610 --> 02:32:34.879
CONSIDER ONGOING A FLEXIBLE

02:32:34.945 --> 02:32:36.881

02:32:36.947 --> 02:32:38.282
I TRULY BELIEVE THAT IT'S ONLY

02:32:38.349 --> 02:32:39.450
THREE SUSTAINED ONGOING

02:32:39.517 --> 02:32:41.085
INFLEXIBLE FUNDING THAT AT THE

02:32:41.151 --> 02:32:42.553
LOCAL LEVEL WILL BE ABLE TO

02:32:42.620 --> 02:32:44.388
REBUILD OUR LOCAL CAPACITIES.

02:32:44.455 --> 02:32:46.156

IT WILL ALSO IMPROVE THE SPEED

02:47:45.455 --> 02:47:47.223
COMPLETENESS AND QUALITY OF DATA

THAT WORK.

02:48:16.920 --> 02:48:18.621

REGIONALIZATION MORE RECENTLY

02:54:33.796 --> 02:54:35.164
SOME LESS REGIONALIZATION.

02:54:35.231 --> 02:54:37.667

THINGS LIKE INFLUENZA NOROVIRUS

02:54:56.586 --> 02:54:58.154
