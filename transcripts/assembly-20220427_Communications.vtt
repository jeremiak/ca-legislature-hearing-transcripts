01:02:29.912 --> 01:02:31.681
WE ALREADY KNOW IT ONLY COVERS A

01:02:31.747 --> 01:02:33.282
FRACTION OF THE INTERNET SERVICE

01:02:33.349 --> 01:02:34.417
PROVIDERS THAT ARE PROVIDING

01:02:34.484 --> 01:02:35.985
BROADBAND. AND WHAT WE SHOULD

01:02:36.052 --> 01:02:37.286

BROADBAND AND THEY ARE BEING

01:02:46.863 --> 01:02:48.231
USED FOR BROADBAND WHAT'S

01:02:48.297 --> 01:02:50.233
IMPORTANT I THINK IS TO HAVE A

01:02:50.299 --> 01:02:52.235
CONSISTENT PROCESS. ACROSS ALL

01:02:52.301 --> 01:02:53.136
THINGS JUST BASED ON THE

01:02:53.202 --> 01:02:54.971

01:02:55.037 --> 01:02:57.006
FIGURED OUT OF BECAUSE A BACK

01:02:57.073 --> 01:02:59.142
DOOR TO REFORM. AND SO I ALWAYS

01:02:59.208 --> 01:03:00.276
GET VERY UNCOMFORTABLE WHEN WE

01:03:00.343 --> 01:03:02.678

01:03:04.180 --> 01:03:06.449
CONSISTENT PROCESS. ACROSS THE

OPPOSITION BUT IT'S REALLY

01:03:20.296 --> 01:03:20.830

DO APPRECIATE THE OPPOSITION'S

01:03:59.268 --> 01:04:02.738
CONCERNS- AND I'VE INDICATED

01:04:02.805 --> 01:04:04.373
THAT I WILL CONTINUE TO WORK

01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:06.108
WITH THEM I KNOW THAT THEIR

01:04:06.175 --> 01:04:08.377
VARYING ELEMENTS OF WHAT. IT IS

01:04:08.444 --> 01:04:10.746
ASKING FOR TO SOME DEGREE-

01:04:10.813 --> 01:04:12.882
CERTAINLY DIRECT TV HAS SORT OF

01:04:12.949 --> 01:04:15.685
THIS UNIQUE. OPPOSITION IF THEY

01:04:15.751 --> 01:04:16.986
FIND THEMSELVES AND I RECOGNIZE

01:04:17.053 --> 01:04:20.056
THAT- VAST TO BE CARVED OUT AND

01:04:20.122 --> 01:04:22.491
I'M NOT SURE THAT THAT'S THE WAY

01:04:22.558 --> 01:04:25.428
TO GO BUT THERE ARE I THINK

01:04:25.494 --> 01:04:27.096
MAYBE SOME OTHER IDEAS. GET TO

01:04:27.163 --> 01:04:28.664
WHERE. OF THEIR CONCERN COULD BE

01:04:28.731 --> 01:04:29.832
ALLEVIATED SO WE'RE GOING TO

01:04:29.899 --> 01:04:31.567
HAVE TO BE A LITTLE BIT CREATIVE

01:04:31.634 --> 01:04:33.302
IN TERMS OF. WHAT THAT LOOKS

01:04:33.369 --> 01:04:35.304
LIKE- SO IN TERMS OF THE DOOR

01:04:35.371 --> 01:04:38.174
BEING OPENED AND- REALLY SITTING

01:04:38.241 --> 01:04:39.609
DOWN AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

01:04:39.675 --> 01:04:41.277
HOW TO GO GRANULAR- I'M

01:04:41.344 --> 01:04:43.346
CERTAINLY PREPARED TO DO THAT-

01:04:43.412 --> 01:04:45.548
AND I. YOU KNOW I CAN ONLY SAY

01:04:45.615 --> 01:04:48.084
THAT WHEN YOU. MY BEST RETORT IS

01:04:48.150 --> 01:04:49.919
THE FOLKS WHO. HAVE ARE

01:04:49.986 --> 01:04:52.388
SUPPORTING THE BILL IT'S ABOUT

01:04:52.455 --> 01:04:53.489
CONSUMERS. ARE WHO ARE GOING

01:04:53.556 --> 01:04:56.692
WITHOUT. IT'S A DOUGHNUT HOLE.

01:04:56.759 --> 01:04:58.728
THE DIFFICULT HASN'T FILLED. I

01:04:58.794 --> 01:05:00.930
DIDN'T ACCOMPLISH WHAT EVERYONE

01:05:00.997 --> 01:05:02.498
AND GOOD INTENTION THOUGHT IT

01:05:02.565 --> 01:05:04.667
WAS SUPPOSED TO DO WHEN IT WAS

01:05:04.734 --> 01:05:05.901
PUT IN PLACE. AND SO WHAT IT WAS

01:05:05.968 --> 01:05:08.037
DESIGNED TO DO WE'RE TRYING TO

01:05:08.104 --> 01:05:10.039
NOW MAKE SURE IT GETS THERE. THE

01:05:10.106 --> 01:05:11.841
GRANITE THERE MAY BE SOME OTHER

01:05:11.907 --> 01:05:14.243
ELEMENTS OF THIS THAT WE NEED TO

01:05:14.310 --> 01:05:15.578
EXPAND AND- AND AN EVALUATION

01:05:15.645 --> 01:05:16.112
THROUGH THE NETWORK. EVEN

01:05:16.178 --> 01:05:19.115
BROADER. BUT IF WE CAN'T GET

01:05:19.181 --> 01:05:21.083
THIS PIECE TO MAKE THE MOST

01:05:21.150 --> 01:05:22.151
SENSE IT WAS DESIGNED TO DO

01:05:22.218 --> 01:05:26.289
THAN. GOING BROADER MAY BE A

01:05:26.355 --> 01:05:27.990
LITTLE BIT MORE BUT MUCH BUT I'M

01:05:28.057 --> 01:05:31.027
NOT LOSING SOME OF THAT CONCERN-

01:05:31.093 --> 01:05:32.862
BUT I DO THINK THAT. AT THIS

01:05:32.928 --> 01:05:34.563
POINT TIME AND MAYBE IT'S ALSO

01:05:34.630 --> 01:05:36.632
THE FACT THAT THE PANDEMIC SORT

01:05:36.699 --> 01:05:39.201
OF OPEN UP OUR VISION TO. THIS

01:05:39.268 --> 01:05:40.136
WHO'S FALLING THROUGH THE

01:05:40.202 --> 01:05:41.170
CRACKS. AND THEN YOU BACKTRACK

01:05:41.237 --> 01:05:42.872
AND TRY TO UNDERSTAND WHY ARE

01:05:42.938 --> 01:05:44.073
THEY FALLING THROUGH THE CRACKS.

01:05:44.140 --> 01:05:46.642
AND THIS GIVES US AN OPPORTUNITY

01:05:46.709 --> 01:05:48.044
SO TO ADDRESS THAT. AND SO TO

01:05:48.110 --> 01:05:51.647
THAT EXTENT- I THINK THIS MOVES

01:05:51.714 --> 01:05:52.615
US IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION- BUT I

01:05:52.682 --> 01:05:55.151
AM AGAIN. YOU KNOW WHEN YOU SEE

01:05:55.217 --> 01:05:57.253
IT THE NEXT TIME. IT WILL SHOW

01:05:57.320 --> 01:06:00.189
THAT. WE PUT SOME ADDITIONAL

01:06:00.256 --> 01:06:01.390
EFFORT INTO IT. SO I RESPECT

01:06:01.457 --> 01:06:04.193
HEARING. THANK YOU. AND I TO AS%

01:06:04.260 --> 01:06:05.861
CHAIR HAVE SEEN THE AMOUNT OF

01:06:05.928 --> 01:06:08.230
EFFORT THAT HAS BEEN PUT INTO

01:06:08.297 --> 01:06:10.299
THIS BILL. BY ALL MEANS IT IS

01:06:10.366 --> 01:06:12.001
NOT PERFECT THERE'S STILL MORE

01:06:12.068 --> 01:06:14.737
WORK TO DO- SPEAKING DIRECTLY

01:06:14.804 --> 01:06:17.039
ABOUT DIRECT TV WE KNOW THAT IS

01:06:17.106 --> 01:06:19.342
A VERY UNIQUE SITUATION AND-

01:06:19.408 --> 01:06:21.477
WINE COMMITTED THAT WE WILL

01:06:21.544 --> 01:06:22.345
CONTINUE TO WORK ON THAT.

01:06:22.411 --> 01:06:24.146
PARTICULAR PART BUT I THINK THE

01:06:24.213 --> 01:06:26.482
BIGGEST THING IS IF YOU GO BACK

01:06:26.549 --> 01:06:28.284
TO. TWO THOUSAND SIX. IMAGINE

01:06:28.351 --> 01:06:31.387
WHAT WE WERE ALL DOING IN TWO

01:06:31.454 --> 01:06:32.688
THOUSAND SIX WHEN IT COMES TO

01:34:34.235 --> 01:34:36.570
THIS PRESIDE OVER THAT. NO NO IT

01:34:36.637 --> 01:34:39.774
WOULD NOT HAPPEN I THINK UP. I

01:34:39.840 --> 01:34:41.275
JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY THAT NONE

01:34:41.342 --> 01:34:45.980
PREVIOUS QUESTION I'M SORRY-

01:34:46.047 --> 01:34:47.882
THAT PREVIOUS QUESTION ON THE A.

01:34:47.948 --> 01:34:50.418
C. P. THE ANSWER IS YES SO WITH

01:34:50.484 --> 01:34:52.386
A FORTY DOLLAR PROGRAM WITH THE

01:34:52.453 --> 01:34:55.356
ACP ADDED THAT WOULD BE A TEN

01:34:55.423 --> 01:34:56.757
DOLLAR- TWENTY FIVE THREE

01:34:56.824 --> 01:34:57.858
PROGRAM WHICH MEETS UP.

01:34:57.925 --> 01:34:59.760
BASICALLY ALBERY DEFINITION OF

01:34:59.827 --> 01:35:01.729
AFFORDABLE OKAY GREAT AND THEN

01:35:01.796 --> 01:35:03.998
CAN YOU EXPLAIN TO THEM HOW DOES

01:35:04.065 --> 01:35:04.965
THIS WORK THEN THAT YOU CAN SET

01:35:05.032 --> 01:35:07.735
A RATE OF BECAUSE I THOUGHT THAT

01:35:07.802 --> 01:35:08.836
THE FEDERAL LAW WITH THEIR

01:35:08.903 --> 01:35:11.172
PROGRAM THEY'RE THE ONES THAT

01:35:11.238 --> 01:35:11.772
HANDLE THE RATE. DEFERRED SO

01:35:11.839 --> 01:35:13.908
THIS IS. ACTUALLY SETTING A RATE

01:35:13.974 --> 01:35:16.410
AT STATES ACTUALLY A AND EVERY

01:35:16.477 --> 01:35:18.379
OTHER STATE THAT HAS A LOCAL

01:35:18.446 --> 01:35:21.348
FRANCHISING TO- ALLOWED TO SET.

01:35:21.415 --> 01:35:23.451
RULES FOR HOW LOCALITIES

01:35:23.517 --> 01:35:26.287
CONTRACT AND CONTRACTING RULES.

01:35:26.353 --> 01:35:28.055
THAT ARE IS NOT RATE SETTING SO

01:35:28.122 --> 01:35:30.157
CUT COMPANIES COULD CHOOSE NOT

01:35:30.224 --> 01:35:32.193
TO SET THESE RATES. AND NOT TO

01:35:32.259 --> 01:35:34.061
OFFER THESE AFFORDABLE PLANS.

01:35:34.128 --> 01:35:37.131
THAT WOULD JUST ALSO BE A CHOICE

01:35:37.198 --> 01:35:38.332
TO NOT HAVE STATE CONTRACT. JUST

01:35:38.399 --> 01:35:39.934
BEEN APPRECIATE THIS IS GREAT-

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:41.068
AND THEN SO IF SAID THIS WENT

01:35:41.135 --> 01:35:43.104
THROUGH AND IT WAS FORTY DOLLAR

01:35:43.170 --> 01:35:44.205
RATE COULD ANOTHER LEGISLATIVE

01:35:44.271 --> 01:35:45.039
COMING THE NEXT YEAR AND CHANGE

01:35:45.106 --> 01:35:47.208
THAT RATE- EITHER UP OR DOWN THE

01:35:47.274 --> 01:35:49.143
WAY THAT THE BILL IS WRITTEN IT

01:35:49.210 --> 01:35:51.779
ALLOWS FOR THE PROGRAM TO ADJUST

01:35:51.846 --> 01:35:53.914
RATES IN ALIGNMENT. WITH PVC AND

01:35:53.981 --> 01:35:55.583
FEDERAL AND ALSO SPEAKS IN

01:35:55.649 --> 01:35:58.219
ALIGNMENT WITH PC AND FEDERAL

01:35:58.285 --> 01:36:03.257
RULES BUT THERE IS I MEAN. WHAT
