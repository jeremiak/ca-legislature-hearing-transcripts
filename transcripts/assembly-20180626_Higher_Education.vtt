UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BIT VAGUE

01:04:40.710 --> 01:04:43.947 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK WE COULD BENEFIT

01:04:42.479 --> 01:04:45.515 region:rollup2
FROM SPECIFIC SPECIFICALLY WHAT

01:04:43.947 --> 01:04:46.549 region:rollup2
ARE THE FISCAL IT FINANCIAL

01:04:45.515 --> 01:04:47.383 region:rollup2
ISSUES ARE CHALLENGES THAT YOU

01:04:46.549 --> 01:04:48.451 region:rollup2
SEE.

01:04:47.383 --> 01:04:49.652 region:rollup2
AND AS MUCH DETAIL AS YOU CAN

01:04:48.451 --> 01:04:50.820 region:rollup2
PROVIDE ON THE IMPLEMENTATION

01:04:49.652 --> 01:04:52.288 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES TO WE HAVE OUR EYES

01:04:50.820 --> 01:04:54.924 region:rollup2
WIDE OPEN ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE

01:04:52.288 --> 01:04:55.625 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY DEALING WITH.

01:04:54.924 --> 01:04:57.460 region:rollup2
SO FROM THE UNIVERSITY

01:04:55.625 --> 01:04:58.628 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA PERSPECTIVE ALL OF

01:04:57.460 --> 01:05:00.230 region:rollup2
OUR CENTERS ARE A LITTLE BIT

01:04:58.628 --> 01:05:01.664 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT WE ARE --

01:05:00.230 --> 01:05:04.334 region:rollup2
THAT ALL OF THE YOU SEE HEALTH

01:05:01.664 --> 01:05:06.035 region:rollup2
CENTERS ARE --

01:05:04.334 --> 01:05:07.270 region:rollup2
PRIMARY CARE HOMES FOR FOR

01:05:06.035 --> 01:05:09.305 region:rollup2
STUDENTS --

01:05:07.270 --> 01:05:09.939 region:rollup2
THE BILL CURRENTLY PROVIDES FOR

01:05:09.305 --> 01:05:11.474 region:rollup2
TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND PER CENTER

01:05:09.939 --> 01:05:12.375 region:rollup2
AND TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND TO THE

01:05:11.474 --> 01:05:13.777 region:rollup2
SYSTEM WE DON'T THINK THAT'S

01:05:12.375 --> 01:05:15.311 region:rollup2
ADEQUATE GIVEN.

01:05:13.777 --> 01:05:16.946 region:rollup2
OF THE KIND OF BAD CHANGES WE

01:05:15.311 --> 01:05:18.815 region:rollup2
MIGHT MAKE NEED TO MAKE IN TERMS

01:05:16.946 --> 01:05:20.717 region:rollup2
OF SECURITY AND SOME OTHER.

01:05:18.815 --> 01:05:22.819 region:rollup2
THING SUB SO AND THE STUDENT

01:05:20.717 --> 01:05:24.287 region:rollup2
HEALTH CENTERS ARE FUNDED

01:05:22.819 --> 01:05:25.755 region:rollup2
THROUGH GENERAL FUND.

01:05:24.287 --> 01:05:29.192 region:rollup2
THROUGH PHILANTHROPY AND THROUGH

01:05:25.755 --> 01:05:31.261 region:rollup2
STUDENT FEES AND SO I'M ANYTHING

01:05:29.192 --> 01:05:32.862 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT COVERED --

01:05:31.261 --> 01:05:34.597 region:rollup2
BY -- GRANT

01:05:32.862 --> 01:05:36.900 region:rollup2
DOLLARS WOULD BE A GENERAL FUND

01:05:34.597 --> 01:05:40.303 region:rollup2
OR STUDENT FEE COST --

01:05:36.900 --> 01:05:43.206 region:rollup2
AND THE BILL IS --

01:05:40.303 --> 01:05:43.773 region:rollup2
PROVIDES AFTER --

01:05:43.206 --> 01:05:46.276 region:rollup2
TWENTY TWENTY TWO IT'S IT'S

01:05:43.773 --> 01:05:48.711 region:rollup2
SILENT WHICH MEANS THOSE ONGOING

01:05:46.276 --> 01:05:51.114 region:rollup2
COSTS WOULD BE UNIVERSITY AS

01:05:48.711 --> 01:05:53.716 region:rollup2
STUDENT FEE COST AND STUDENT AND

01:05:51.114 --> 01:05:55.852 region:rollup2
OR GENERAL FUND COST AND OUR

01:05:53.716 --> 01:05:57.420 region:rollup2
STUDENT BODY IS VERY SENSITIVE

01:05:55.852 --> 01:06:01.658 region:rollup2
TO INCREASING IN FEES.

01:05:57.420 --> 01:06:03.660 region:rollup2
AND THIS BODY IS VERY SENSITIVE

01:06:01.658 --> 01:06:05.028 region:rollup2
TO HAVING ANY GENERAL FUND

01:06:03.660 --> 01:06:07.363 region:rollup2
BECAUSE ADDED TO OUR BASE --

01:06:05.028 --> 01:06:08.965 region:rollup2
BUDGET.

01:06:07.363 --> 01:06:11.134 region:rollup2
SO -- AYE I

01:06:08.965 --> 01:06:13.069 region:rollup2
THINK I'M A TOP OF THE LINE

01:06:11.134 --> 01:06:14.637 region:rollup2
THAT'S PROBABLY --

01:06:13.069 --> 01:06:15.872 region:rollup2
ARE CONCERNED THE BILL HAS GONE

01:06:14.637 --> 01:06:17.373 region:rollup2
THROUGH SEVERAL ITERATIONS SO

01:06:15.872 --> 01:06:18.575 region:rollup2
DEPENDING UPON ITERATION OUR

01:06:17.373 --> 01:06:21.477 region:rollup2
CONCERNS HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT IF

01:06:18.575 --> 01:06:23.680 region:rollup2
THIS HAS BEEN THE MOST RECENT --

01:06:21.477 --> 01:06:24.380 region:rollup2
THAT VERSION OF THE BILL IN

01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:26.616 region:rollup2
THESE ARE.

01:06:24.380 --> 01:06:27.917 region:rollup2
AYE CONCERNS NOW AS ITS FIRST

01:06:26.616 --> 01:06:30.220 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTATION WE'VE HEARD IT.

01:06:27.917 --> 01:06:30.920 region:rollup2
ARE REPORTED THAT --

01:06:30.220 --> 01:06:32.455 region:rollup2
ABORTION --

01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:33.690 region:rollup2
BY MEDICATION SERVICES ARE

01:06:32.455 --> 01:06:35.091 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE THIRTY MINUTES AWAY

01:06:33.690 --> 01:06:36.226 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY TRUE FOR

01:06:35.091 --> 01:06:37.460 region:rollup2
ALL THE UC'S IT MAY BE TRUE

01:06:36.226 --> 01:06:38.461 region:rollup2
AGGREGATE IF YOU LOOK AT EVERY

01:06:37.460 --> 01:06:39.729 region:rollup2
SYSTEM IN.

01:06:38.461 --> 01:06:41.698 region:rollup2
DIVIDED BY SOME NUMBER BUT WE

01:06:39.729 --> 01:06:42.966 region:rollup2
HAVE SOME ABORTION SERVICES

01:06:41.698 --> 01:06:45.101 region:rollup2
WITHIN EVEN WALKING DISTANCE WAS

01:06:42.966 --> 01:06:47.170 region:rollup2
SOME CAMPUSES SOME CAMPUSES IT

01:06:45.101 --> 01:06:47.704 region:rollup2
IS THAT I'M TEN TO FIFTEEN

01:06:47.170 --> 01:06:48.771 region:rollup2
MINUTES.

01:06:47.704 --> 01:06:52.609 region:rollup2
HIGH RIGHTS SOME IT MAY EVEN BE

01:06:48.771 --> 01:06:54.143 region:rollup2
A FIFTEEN MINUTE DRIVE SO IT'S

01:06:52.609 --> 01:06:55.478 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT THAT --

01:06:54.143 --> 01:06:57.680 region:rollup2
I'M WE DO THINK THAT THAT THAT

01:06:55.478 --> 01:06:59.482 region:rollup2
THE COMMUNITY ACCESS IS THERE

01:06:57.680 --> 01:07:00.149 region:rollup2
THERE ARE SOME THINGS I THINK WE

01:06:59.482 --> 01:07:02.085 region:rollup2
COULD PROBABLY DO TO IMPROVE ON

01:07:00.149 --> 01:07:03.920 region:rollup2
THAT -- AND

01:07:02.085 --> 01:07:04.888 region:rollup2
SO -- I

01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:07.624 region:rollup2
THINK -- IN

01:07:04.888 --> 01:07:09.259 region:rollup2
TERMS OF IMPLEMENTATION WE JUST

01:07:07.624 --> 01:07:09.826 region:rollup2
WANTED TO MAKE SURE --

01:07:09.259 --> 01:07:12.028 region:rollup2
FIRST THAT THE COSTS ARE ARE

01:07:09.826 --> 01:07:13.429 region:rollup2
ARE.

01:07:12.028 --> 01:07:16.733 region:rollup2
PROBABLY ARE ARE ARE TOPPLING

01:07:13.429 --> 01:07:20.236 region:rollup2
CONCERNED ALONG [inaudible]

01:07:16.733 --> 01:07:22.005 region:rollup2
PURITY AND I MEAN I I DO THINK

01:07:20.236 --> 01:07:23.506 region:rollup2
THAT IT'S GOING TO BE --

01:07:22.005 --> 01:07:24.707 region:rollup2
SUPPORTING THE PROGRAM ONGOING

01:07:23.506 --> 01:07:25.775 region:rollup2
THE FUNDING --

01:07:24.707 --> 01:07:26.643 region:rollup2
TO SORT OUT THE PROGRAM WAS

01:07:25.775 --> 01:07:28.144 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE GREAT TO BUY

01:07:26.643 --> 01:07:29.579 region:rollup2
EQUIPMENT INTO THE TRAINING THAT

01:07:28.144 --> 01:07:31.514 region:rollup2
WE APPRECIATE OF ABOUT.

01:07:29.579 --> 01:07:33.616 region:rollup2
I WOULD I IMAGINE THAT OVER TIME

01:07:31.514 --> 01:07:35.752 region:rollup2
THAT STAFF WILL LEAVE --

01:07:33.616 --> 01:07:37.020 region:rollup2
AND GO TO OTHER OPPORTUNITIES.

01:07:35.752 --> 01:07:37.820 region:rollup2
BECAUSE FRANKLY WILD CAESAR'S

01:07:37.020 --> 01:07:39.155 region:rollup2
GREAT PLACE TO WORK THERE

01:07:37.820 --> 01:07:39.956 region:rollup2
PROBABLY ARE BUT OPTIONS FOR

01:07:39.155 --> 01:07:42.058 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES FORCING PEOPLE OF

01:07:39.956 --> 01:07:43.226 region:rollup2
MEDICAL DEGREES. TO GO ELSEWHERE

01:07:42.058 --> 01:07:45.728 region:rollup2
AND RETAINING AND RECRUITING

01:07:43.226 --> 01:07:46.663 region:rollup2
STAFF -- IN

01:07:45.728 --> 01:07:47.263 region:rollup2
RETRAINING THE STAFF WILL BE AN

01:07:46.663 --> 01:07:49.699 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT PART OF ONGOING COST

01:07:47.263 --> 01:07:51.200 region:rollup2
--

01:07:49.699 --> 01:07:53.202 region:rollup2
AND THEN THE LIABILITY THAT

01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:53.836 region:rollup2
KEEPS ITS MAY BE INCURRING IT

01:07:53.202 --> 01:07:55.338 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THE BREAST ARE MINIMAL

01:07:53.836 --> 01:07:55.972 region:rollup2
--

01:07:55.338 --> 01:07:56.773 region:rollup2
SO I DON'T WANT TO OVERSTATE IT

01:07:55.972 --> 01:07:58.508 region:rollup2
--

01:07:56.773 --> 01:07:59.842 region:rollup2
BUT BUT THERE IS GOING TO BE A

01:07:58.508 --> 01:08:01.978 region:rollup2
RISK AND IT'S GOING TO BE A

01:07:59.842 --> 01:08:02.579 region:rollup2
LIABILITY RISK ASSOCIATED WITH

01:08:01.978 --> 01:08:04.514 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:08:02.579 --> 01:08:06.115 region:rollup2
AND THE WAY WE A COST WORKS ON

01:08:04.514 --> 01:08:07.817 region:rollup2
LIABILITY AT CSU AS A CAPSULE

01:08:06.115 --> 01:08:10.687 region:rollup2
PAY A CERTAIN AMOUNT OUT OF

01:08:07.817 --> 01:08:11.220 region:rollup2
THEIR POCKET FIFTY TWO FIVE

01:08:10.687 --> 01:08:12.555 region:rollup2
THOUSAND DOLLARS EXPENSIVE

PACKAGE THEY HAVE.

01:08:13.690 --> 01:08:16.926 region:rollup2
BEEN THE CSU PAUL SOUP CHICKEN

01:08:15.258 --> 01:08:17.493 region:rollup2
AFTERWARDS.

01:08:16.926 --> 01:08:19.162 region:rollup2

01:15:05.701 --> 01:15:08.237 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLY MEMBER WE HAVE BEEN

SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE VERY

01:15:17.113 --> 01:15:20.449 region:rollup2
BENEFICIAL BECAUSE I THINK IT'S

01:15:18.447 --> 01:15:21.550 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT TO HAVE A STATUS QUO

01:15:20.449 --> 01:15:23.185 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF POLICY ABOUT WHAT

01:15:21.550 --> 01:15:24.253 region:rollup2
MONIES AND FEES COULD.

01:15:23.185 --> 01:15:25.921 region:rollup2

01:15:24.253 --> 01:15:27.256 region:rollup2
TO THIS SERVICE.

01:15:25.921 --> 01:15:29.158 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE COST

01:15:27.256 --> 01:15:31.160 region:rollup2
CONCERNS THAT YOU SEE --

01:15:29.158 --> 01:15:32.628 region:rollup2
AND CSU HAVE HAVE BOTH RAISED TO

01:15:31.160 --> 01:15:34.597 region:rollup2
S. AND IMPLEMENTATION.

01:15:32.628 --> 01:15:36.732 region:rollup2
AND AGAIN --

01:15:34.597 --> 01:15:38.067 region:rollup2
TAKE A STEP BACK TO THE THE NEED

01:15:36.732 --> 01:15:39.902 region:rollup2
FOR THE BILL WE JUST HEARD

01:15:38.067 --> 01:15:41.103 region:rollup2
TESTIMONY AT LEAST FROM YOU SEE

01:15:39.902 --> 01:15:42.338 region:rollup2
THAT -- IN A

01:15:41.103 --> 01:15:44.006 region:rollup2
AND I THINK FROM THE OPPOSITION

01:15:42.338 --> 01:15:46.175 region:rollup2
THAT WITHIN.

01:15:44.006 --> 01:15:47.810 region:rollup2
MOST OF THIS CSU AND UC CAMPUSES

01:15:46.175 --> 01:15:49.512 region:rollup2
ARE.

01:15:47.810 --> 01:15:51.414 region:rollup2
IN AREAS THAT HAVE SOME

01:15:49.512 --> 01:15:54.150 region:rollup2
POPULATION AND THAT THERE MAY BE

01:15:51.414 --> 01:15:55.217 region:rollup2
A TENER FIFTEEN MINUTE BUS RIDE.

01:15:54.150 --> 01:15:56.852 region:rollup2
TO A FACILITY THAT COULD PROVIDE

01:15:55.217 --> 01:15:59.588 region:rollup2
THIS.

01:15:56.852 --> 01:16:01.357 region:rollup2
AND GIVEN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES

01:15:59.588 --> 01:16:02.992 region:rollup2
WHY NOT LEAVE THIS UP TO YOU SEE

01:16:01.357 --> 01:16:04.960 region:rollup2
IN CS YOU TO LOOK AT THEIR OWN

01:16:02.992 --> 01:16:06.395 region:rollup2
CAMPUS NEEDS.

01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:07.930 region:rollup2
WHAT THEY DO HAVE THEIR OWN

01:16:06.395 --> 01:16:10.733 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF A

01:16:07.930 --> 01:16:12.334 region:rollup2
LOCAL CONTROL ARGUMENT --

01:16:10.733 --> 01:16:13.235 region:rollup2
WE'D TELL YOU SEE AND WE TRY TO

01:16:12.334 --> 01:16:14.336 region:rollup2

THE TIME TO DO BUT WE ALSO

01:16:14.336 --> 01:16:16.972 region:rollup2
SHOULD PRACTICE SOME RESTRAINT

01:16:15.638 --> 01:16:18.908 region:rollup2
IN THAT WHY NOT LET AN

01:16:16.972 --> 01:16:20.476 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL CAMPUS.

01:16:18.908 --> 01:16:21.877 region:rollup2
OR WOULD THE REGENTS OR THE

01:16:20.476 --> 01:16:24.513 region:rollup2
TRUSTEES FOR CS YOU MAKE THAT

01:16:21.877 --> 01:16:25.848 region:rollup2
DECISION --

01:16:24.513 --> 01:16:27.516 region:rollup2
AS I LOOK AT THIS I WOULD SAY A

01:16:25.848 --> 01:16:29.251 region:rollup2
COUPLE OF THINGS ONE I WOULD SAY

01:16:27.516 --> 01:16:30.920 region:rollup2
RECENTLY THE A LEGISLATOR JUST

01:16:29.251 --> 01:16:32.354 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE JUST VOTED ON A BILL

01:16:30.920 --> 01:16:33.189 region:rollup2
MANDATING THAT SEE ISSUES AND

01:16:32.354 --> 01:16:34.957 region:rollup2
UC'S.

01:16:33.189 --> 01:16:36.358 region:rollup2
HOW PROVIDE MENTAL HEALTH SO WE

01:16:34.957 --> 01:16:37.827 region:rollup2
DO MANDATE ALL THE TIME IT'S

01:16:36.358 --> 01:16:39.595 region:rollup2
KIND OF WHAT WE DO IS A BODY BUT

01:16:37.827 --> 01:16:41.430 region:rollup2
NUMBER TWO I WOULD SAY MY

01:16:39.595 --> 01:16:42.698 region:rollup2
WITNESS WHO TESTIFIED --

01:16:41.430 --> 01:16:44.300 region:rollup2
FROM YOU SEE OUR AND TALKED

01:16:42.698 --> 01:16:44.800 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE DIFFICULTY SHE HAD

01:16:44.300 --> 01:16:46.936 region:rollup2
GIVING TO AN OFF CAMPUS

01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:49.138 region:rollup2
PROVIDER.

01:16:46.936 --> 01:16:51.607 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU ARE ON CAMPUS AND I DID

01:16:49.138 --> 01:16:52.875 region:rollup2
NOT DO COLLEGE THAT WAY I WAS

01:16:51.607 --> 01:16:54.176 region:rollup2
MARRIED AND WORKING FULL TIME SO

01:16:52.875 --> 01:16:56.378 region:rollup2
I DID NOT LIVE ON CAMPUS?

01:16:54.176 --> 01:16:57.480 region:rollup2
BUT EVEN THAT EVEN THAT MY OWN

01:16:56.378 --> 01:16:59.215 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE YOU BECOME VERY

01:16:57.480 --> 01:17:01.083 region:rollup2
COMPARABLE WITH YOUR COLLEGE

01:16:59.215 --> 01:17:02.518 region:rollup2
CAMPUS YOU BECOME COMFORTABLE

01:17:01.083 --> 01:17:05.421 region:rollup2
BEING ABLE TO GO SOMEPLACE AND

01:17:02.518 --> 01:17:06.956 region:rollup2
ASK THEM FOR ADVICE.

01:17:05.421 --> 01:17:08.824 region:rollup2
HAVING MEDICAID ABORTION A

01:17:06.956 --> 01:17:10.693 region:rollup2
PROVIDED ON CAMPUS AT THE HEALTH

01:17:08.824 --> 01:17:12.995 region:rollup2
CENTERS GIVES THE STUDENT THE

01:17:10.693 --> 01:17:14.196 region:rollup2
ACCESS THAT THEY NEED.

01:17:12.995 --> 01:17:15.664 region:rollup2
YOU CAN ONLY HAVE A MEDICAID

01:17:14.196 --> 01:17:16.765 region:rollup2
ABORTION UP TO TEN WEEKS MOST

01:17:15.664 --> 01:17:18.100 region:rollup2
WOMEN DON'T EVEN FIND OUT

01:17:16.765 --> 01:17:19.001 region:rollup2
THEY'RE PREGNANT INTO THE FIVE

01:17:18.100 --> 01:17:21.804 region:rollup2
OR SIX WEEKS ALONG.

01:17:19.001 --> 01:17:23.339 region:rollup2
SO TIMELINESS AS OF THE ISSUE

01:17:21.804 --> 01:17:25.441 region:rollup2
AND YOURE ALREADY IN A

01:17:23.339 --> 01:17:26.742 region:rollup2
STRESSFUL SITUATION AND HAVING

01:17:25.441 --> 01:17:28.110 region:rollup2
TO THINK ABOUT WHERE DO I GO

01:17:26.742 --> 01:17:29.211 region:rollup2
WHAT DO I DO TO I HAVE A CARD

01:17:28.110 --> 01:17:31.013 region:rollup2
WHY NOT HAVE A CAR.

01:17:29.211 --> 01:17:31.847 region:rollup2
EVEN IT'S ONLY FIVE OR TEN MILES

01:17:31.013 --> 01:17:33.082 region:rollup2
AWAY.

01:17:31.847 --> 01:17:34.717 region:rollup2
IT'S STILL LOGISTICALLY

01:17:33.082 --> 01:17:35.751 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT WHEN YOU ARE ALREADY

01:17:34.717 --> 01:17:37.386 region:rollup2
STRUGGLING WITH WHAT YOU'RE

01:17:35.751 --> 01:17:38.521 region:rollup2
GOING TO DO TO BE ABLE TO WALK

01:17:37.386 --> 01:17:40.923 region:rollup2
ACROSS CAMPUS.

01:17:38.521 --> 01:17:42.091 region:rollup2
AND GET SOME ANSWERS IS IT'S

01:17:40.923 --> 01:17:43.492 region:rollup2
ABOUT ACCESS IT'S A

01:17:42.091 --> 01:17:45.327 region:rollup2
CONSTITUTIONALLY PROTECTED RIGHT

01:17:43.492 --> 01:17:46.662 region:rollup2
BUT IF YOU DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO

01:17:45.327 --> 01:17:46.862 region:rollup2
THAT CONSTITUTIONALLY PROTECTED

01:17:46.662 --> 01:17:48.597 region:rollup2
RIGHT.

01:17:46.862 --> 01:17:51.300 region:rollup2
IS IT REALLY RIGHT.

01:17:48.597 --> 01:17:53.669 region:rollup2
CAN I AM THE RIGHT NOW CAN A

01:17:51.300 --> 01:17:55.404 region:rollup2
STUDENT GO TO A HEALTH CENTER

01:17:53.669 --> 01:17:57.573 region:rollup2
AND ASK ALL THOSE QUESTIONS IT'S

01:17:55.404 --> 01:17:58.207 region:rollup2
JUST THE MEDICATION THAT THEY

01:17:57.573 --> 01:18:02.645 region:rollup2
CAN OBTAIN THAT IS CORRECT OKAY

01:17:58.207 --> 01:18:04.880 region:rollup2
--

01:18:02.645 --> 01:18:06.982 region:rollup2
I I WOULD.

01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:08.784 region:rollup2
REALLY BE VERY GRATEFUL AND HOPE

01:18:06.982 --> 01:18:10.152 region:rollup2
THAT THE PROVISION ABOUT JANUARY

01:18:08.784 --> 01:18:12.321 region:rollup2
FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TWO COULD BE

01:18:10.152 --> 01:18:14.056 region:rollup2
REMOVED --

01:18:12.321 --> 01:18:16.425 region:rollup2
AND THAT WE LOOK AT THESE COST

01:18:14.056 --> 01:18:18.194 region:rollup2
ISSUES WE'VE BEEN QUITE THE

01:18:16.425 --> 01:18:21.931 region:rollup2
WATCHDOG HAVE PARTICULAR YOU SEE

LEGISLATURE AND EVERY SINGLE

01:18:25.768 --> 01:18:29.572 region:rollup2
TIME WE IMPOSE UPON THEM.

01:18:27.703 --> 01:18:30.439 region:rollup2
AND AND WITHOUT MUCH FLEXIBILITY

01:18:29.572 --> 01:18:32.007 region:rollup2
WHAT THEY NEED TO DO AND WE

01:18:30.439 --> 01:18:33.442 region:rollup2
DON'T BACK IT UP WITH ALL THE

01:18:32.007 --> 01:18:35.144 region:rollup2
RESOURCES THEY NEED OR THOUGHT

01:18:33.442 --> 01:18:36.378 region:rollup2
SAM LOCAL FLEXIBILITY I THINK

01:18:35.144 --> 01:18:37.146 region:rollup2
WE'RE KIND OF TAKING SOME STEPS

01:18:36.378 --> 01:18:38.280 region:rollup2
BACKWARDS.

01:18:37.146 --> 01:18:39.548 region:rollup2

01:19:33.869 --> 01:19:38.974 region:rollup2
CONFUSING I THINK.

01:19:35.904 --> 01:19:42.077 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT SO I WOULD ASK.

01:19:38.974 --> 01:19:43.979 region:rollup2
ARE YOU CONCERNED ABOUT THE

01:19:42.077 --> 01:19:46.282 region:rollup2
HEMORRHAGING AND THE POTENTIAL

01:19:43.979 --> 01:19:49.351 region:rollup2
FOR PROBLEMS WITH THE USE OF A

01:19:46.282 --> 01:19:50.119 region:rollup2
MEDICATED ABORTION.

01:19:49.351 --> 01:19:50.886 region:rollup2
THE I THINK FOR THE C. ISSUES

01:19:50.119 --> 01:19:53.055 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE.

01:19:50.886 --> 01:19:54.857 region:rollup2
IF THE HEALTH CENTERS.

01:19:53.055 --> 01:19:57.359 region:rollup2
ARE PROVIDING A SERVICE TO

01:19:54.857 --> 01:19:58.293 region:rollup2
STUDENTS TOM.

01:19:57.359 --> 01:19:58.827 region:rollup2
IN THERE THE INTENT IS THAT

01:19:58.293 --> 01:20:02.598 region:rollup2
THERE IT'S FROM MONDAY TO

01:19:58.827 --> 01:20:05.534 region:rollup2
FRIDAY.

01:20:02.598 --> 01:20:07.036 region:rollup2
NINE TO FIVE AND FIVE OR EIGHTY

01:20:05.534 --> 01:20:07.803 region:rollup2
FIVE ABOUT BALLOTS --

01:20:07.036 --> 01:20:08.270 region:rollup2
CRITTERS SURE THAT THEY'RE

01:20:07.803 --> 01:20:09.705 region:rollup2
THEY'RE BEING TREATED

01:20:08.270 --> 01:20:11.774 region:rollup2
SUCCESSFULLY AND WHEN I WHEN WE

01:20:09.705 --> 01:20:13.709 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY. TO

01:20:11.774 --> 01:20:14.576 region:rollup2
ADDRESS THE CONCERNS OF THE

01:20:13.709 --> 01:20:15.444 region:rollup2
STUDENT --

01:20:14.576 --> 01:20:16.045 region:rollup2
WE IDENTIFY PRETTY QUICKLY WE

01:20:15.444 --> 01:20:17.813 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE THAT THEY GO TO THE

01:20:16.045 --> 01:20:19.515 region:rollup2
RIGHT PLACE.

01:20:17.813 --> 01:20:21.383 region:rollup2
THERE THERE IS A CONCERN THERE

01:20:19.515 --> 01:20:23.419 region:rollup2
IS A RISK IT IS MINIMAL THAT YES

01:20:21.383 --> 01:20:24.453 region:rollup2
THERE IS COMPETITORS A RISK AND

01:20:23.419 --> 01:20:25.387 region:rollup2
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:20:24.453 --> 01:20:26.021 region:rollup2
STUDENTS.

01:20:25.387 --> 01:20:28.257 region:rollup2
ARE ADDRESSED AND APPROPRIATELY

01:20:26.021 --> 01:20:29.591 region:rollup2
--

01:20:28.257 --> 01:20:32.561 region:rollup2
DIRECTED TO WHERE THEY CAN BE TO

01:20:29.591 --> 01:20:34.063 region:rollup2
THE PARTICULAR OF APPROPRIATELY.

01:20:32.561 --> 01:20:38.567 region:rollup2
YOUR YOUR ASSESSMENT OF A

01:20:34.063 --> 01:20:41.170 region:rollup2
MINIMAL RISK --

01:20:38.567 --> 01:20:42.971 region:rollup2
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT.

01:20:41.170 --> 01:20:44.273 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY MEDICAID ABORTION

01:20:42.971 --> 01:20:46.709 region:rollup2
AND ARGUE FOR EIGHTY SIX DOES

01:20:44.273 --> 01:20:49.111 region:rollup2
HAVE --

01:20:46.709 --> 01:20:51.113 region:rollup2
ELEVATED RISK WITH RESPECT TO A

01:20:49.111 --> 01:20:54.049 region:rollup2
A COMPARATIVE [inaudible]

01:20:51.113 --> 01:20:55.784 region:rollup2
METHODOLOGY OF GETTING AN

01:20:54.049 --> 01:20:57.753 region:rollup2
ABORTION OUT WHAT CAUSES YOU TO

01:20:55.784 --> 01:21:00.989 region:rollup2
DETERMINE THE RISK.

01:20:57.753 --> 01:21:01.790 region:rollup2
IS A MINIMAL.

01:21:00.989 --> 01:21:02.424 region:rollup2
A FREQUENT WAS GOING UP THE

01:21:01.790 --> 01:21:03.258 region:rollup2
RESEARCH THAT WAS PROVIDED TO US

01:21:02.424 --> 01:21:05.527 region:rollup2
--

01:21:03.258 --> 01:21:08.397 region:rollup2
BY THE UCS HALF --

01:21:05.527 --> 01:21:09.031 region:rollup2
AND DR GROSSMAN DID COME TO THE

01:21:08.397 --> 01:21:12.101 region:rollup2
HEALTH CENTER DIRECTORS AND DID

01:21:09.031 --> 01:21:13.902 region:rollup2
PRESENT THAT AS WELL --

01:21:12.101 --> 01:21:15.537 region:rollup2
SO AYE I'M NOT I'M NOT BY ANY

01:21:13.902 --> 01:21:16.505 region:rollup2
MEANS AN EXPERT ARE YOU FOUR

01:21:15.537 --> 01:21:18.507 region:rollup2
EIGHTY SIX THE RISK ASSOCIATED

01:21:16.505 --> 01:21:20.509 region:rollup2
ARE I'M RELYING ON THE DAY OF

01:21:18.507 --> 01:21:22.344 region:rollup2
THAT TALK REST BRIGHTEST GOING

01:21:20.509 --> 01:21:23.679 region:rollup2
ANSWER THAT AS WELL OF COURSE.

01:21:22.344 --> 01:21:24.646 region:rollup2
YEAH JUST AYE AGAIN AS AS DR

01:21:23.679 --> 01:21:26.382 region:rollup2
GROSSMAN PROVIDED TESTIMONY IN

THE PREVIOUS ON COMMITTEE

01:21:26.382 --> 01:21:30.853 region:rollup2
HEARING --

01:21:27.483 --> 01:21:32.554 region:rollup2
ONLY ABOUT 3% OF PEOPLE GET

01:21:30.853 --> 01:21:35.057 region:rollup2
MEDICATION ABORTION WILL NEED

01:21:32.554 --> 01:21:39.027 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL TREATMENT AND LESS

01:21:35.057 --> 01:21:40.429 region:rollup2
THAN HALF OF 1% WOULD NEED.

01:21:39.027 --> 01:21:41.997 region:rollup2
SIT TREATMENT AT AT IT MAYBE AT

01:21:40.429 --> 01:21:44.032 region:rollup2
A HOSPITAL SO IT'S IT'S QUITE A

01:21:41.997 --> 01:21:46.101 region:rollup2
SMALL PERCENTAGE.

01:21:44.032 --> 01:21:46.735 region:rollup2
LIKE TO ADDRESS OR HAVE THE CSU

01:21:46.101 --> 01:21:51.006 region:rollup2
IS TALK TO TO ME ABOUT THE NEED

01:21:46.735 --> 01:21:52.908 region:rollup2
--

[inaudible]

01:21:55.010 --> 01:21:59.314 region:rollup2
BUT A I YOU KNOW THIS IS A THIS

01:21:58.680 --> 01:22:02.084 region:rollup2
IS A SIGNIFICANT MATTER HERE WHO

01:21:59.314 --> 01:22:04.953 region:rollup2

01:22:02.084 --> 01:22:05.554 region:rollup2
WITH AGAIN AT THAT CAN YOU

01:22:04.953 --> 01:22:06.889 region:rollup2
ASSESS THE NEED FOR THIS IT I

01:22:05.554 --> 01:22:07.523 region:rollup2
MEAN.

01:22:06.889 --> 01:22:11.894 region:rollup2
IF THE INFORMATION WE HAVE ABOUT

01:22:07.523 --> 01:22:13.495 region:rollup2
--

01:22:11.894 --> 01:22:14.696 region:rollup2
ABORTION TO CHEMICAL ABORTION

01:22:13.495 --> 01:22:17.900 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS ARE WITHIN FIVE MILES

01:22:14.696 --> 01:22:18.567 region:rollup2
OR SO --

01:22:17.900 --> 01:22:20.502 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:22:18.567 --> 01:22:21.703 region:rollup2
SOMETHING SOMETHING LIKE THAT

01:22:20.502 --> 01:22:23.605 region:rollup2
THE SHORTEST DISTANCE IS OF A

01:22:21.703 --> 01:22:25.440 region:rollup2
MILE AND A HALF THERE ARE SOME.

01:22:23.605 --> 01:22:27.576 region:rollup2
CAMPUSES THAT HAVE AT SOME

01:22:25.440 --> 01:22:30.179 region:rollup2
AVAILABILITY MAYBE TEN MILES.

01:22:27.576 --> 01:22:35.250 region:rollup2
I'M AWAY WHAT IS THE OVER RIDING

01:22:30.179 --> 01:22:37.653 region:rollup2
COMPELLING NEED. TO PUT THIS --

01:22:35.250 --> 01:22:40.789 region:rollup2
PRESCRIPTION AND MEDICAID

01:22:37.653 --> 01:22:42.090 region:rollup2
ABORTION ON THE CAMPUS ITSELF.

01:22:40.789 --> 01:22:44.293 region:rollup2
IF THERE IS CLOSE PROXIMITY FOR

01:22:42.090 --> 01:22:47.329 region:rollup2
SIMILAR SERVICE.

01:22:44.293 --> 01:22:48.530 region:rollup2
I DON'T KNOW THAT I HAVE.

01:22:47.329 --> 01:22:51.400 region:rollup2
THE BILL WOULD ANSWER IT --

01:22:48.530 --> 01:22:53.402 region:rollup2
I REALLY LEARNED THAT THE AUTHOR

01:22:51.400 --> 01:22:55.070 region:rollup2
TO MISTER CHAIRMAN I LEAVE --

01:22:53.402 --> 01:22:57.406 region:rollup2
THE BERKELEY STUDENTS THAT ARE

01:22:55.070 --> 01:22:59.608 region:rollup2
PART OF THE CENTERS ON A CLUB ON

01:22:57.406 --> 01:23:01.443 region:rollup2
THE THE CAMPUS A PARTICULAR

01:22:59.608 --> 01:23:02.978 region:rollup2
PETITION WENT TO UC BERKELEY

01:23:01.443 --> 01:23:03.512 region:rollup2
LEADERSHIP AND ASKED TO HAVE THE

01:23:02.978 --> 01:23:05.214 region:rollup2
SERVICE PROVIDED ON THEIR

01:23:03.512 --> 01:23:06.481 region:rollup2
CAMPUS.

01:23:05.214 --> 01:23:08.417 region:rollup2
AND THEY WERE DENIED THAT SO

01:23:06.481 --> 01:23:09.351 region:rollup2
THEY CAME TO ME AND ASKED IF WE

01:23:08.417 --> 01:23:10.886 region:rollup2
COULD DO SOMETHING TO MAKE SURE

01:23:09.351 --> 01:23:13.088 region:rollup2
THAT EVERY STUDENT.

01:23:10.886 --> 01:23:14.556 region:rollup2
HAS ACCESS TO MEDICATED I THINK

01:23:13.088 --> 01:23:15.791 region:rollup2
YOU SAID CHEMICAL THAT WE'RE NOT

01:23:14.556 --> 01:23:17.359 region:rollup2
WE DON'T KNOW OF OF OF WHAT A

01:23:15.791 --> 01:23:19.228 region:rollup2
CHEMICAL ABORTIONISTS BUT

01:23:17.359 --> 01:23:20.329 region:rollup2
MEDICATED ABORTION SO THAT'S

01:23:19.228 --> 01:23:21.597 region:rollup2
WHERE THE NEED FOR THIS CAME

01:23:20.329 --> 01:23:24.299 region:rollup2
FROM IT CAME RIGHT FROM THE

01:23:21.597 --> 01:23:26.902 region:rollup2
STUDENTS.

01:23:24.299 --> 01:23:28.937 region:rollup2
I AM I THINK YOU PROBABLY --

01:23:26.902 --> 01:23:32.307 region:rollup2
ADDRESSED BE --

01:23:28.937 --> 01:23:34.810 region:rollup2
THE LIABILITY ISSUE BUT YOU.

01:23:32.307 --> 01:23:35.110 region:rollup2
IF YOU DO UNDERSTAND THAT

01:23:34.810 --> 01:23:37.913 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

01:23:35.110 --> 01:23:39.615 region:rollup2
DISPENSING A PARDON MEDICAL

01:23:37.913 --> 01:23:41.884 region:rollup2
ABORTION WITH THE POTENTIAL EVEN

01:23:39.615 --> 01:23:42.651 region:rollup2
43%.

01:23:41.884 --> 01:23:45.087 region:rollup2
WITH A HEMORRHAGE IN A

01:23:42.651 --> 01:23:48.657 region:rollup2
CIRCUMSTANCE IN WHICH BY YOUR

01:23:45.087 --> 01:23:50.192 region:rollup2
OWN TESTIMONY THE DUBBED REMEDY

01:23:48.657 --> 01:23:52.494 region:rollup2
FOR THIS IS --

01:23:50.192 --> 01:23:54.630 region:rollup2
THE EMERGENCY ROOM --

01:23:52.494 --> 01:23:55.530 region:rollup2
ARE YOU [inaudible]

01:23:54.630 --> 01:23:57.766 region:rollup2
HOW?

01:23:55.530 --> 01:23:58.800 region:rollup2
COULD YOU SCOPE.

01:23:57.766 --> 01:24:01.603 region:rollup2
YOUR LIABILITY CONCERNS ON A

01:23:58.800 --> 01:24:03.772 region:rollup2
SCALE.

01:24:01.603 --> 01:24:06.208 region:rollup2
A LOT OF LIABILITY MODELA

01:24:03.772 --> 01:24:07.009 region:rollup2
LIABILITY --

01:24:06.208 --> 01:24:08.110 region:rollup2
I MEAN IT'S GOING TO KEEP YOU

01:24:07.009 --> 01:24:09.611 region:rollup2
AWAKE AT NIGHT WILL THERE BE

01:24:08.110 --> 01:24:14.716 region:rollup2
CONCERNS WITH RESPECT TO THAT

01:24:09.611 --> 01:24:16.919 region:rollup2
ACTIVITY OR NOT.

01:24:14.716 --> 01:24:18.820 region:rollup2
SO I THINK THAT THE THE

01:24:16.919 --> 01:24:19.988 region:rollup2
CHALLENGE THERE THAT TWO THINGS

01:24:18.820 --> 01:24:22.324 region:rollup2
A LIABILITY CERTAINLY THERE'S

01:24:19.988 --> 01:24:23.759 region:rollup2
HOPE THERE'S A RISK AND I THINK

01:24:22.324 --> 01:24:25.227 region:rollup2
THAT -- FOR

01:24:23.759 --> 01:24:27.429 region:rollup2
US THE RISK WOULD MEAN THAT

01:24:25.227 --> 01:24:29.131 region:rollup2
THOSE STUDENTS WOULD NEED TO BE

01:24:27.429 --> 01:24:30.832 region:rollup2
SEEN IN AN EMERGENCY ROOM --

01:24:29.131 --> 01:24:32.901 region:rollup2
IT'SNOT THE HEALTH CENTERS ARE

01:24:30.832 --> 01:24:34.503 region:rollup2
NOT EQUIPPED --

01:24:32.901 --> 01:24:36.138 region:rollup2
TO BUT MOST OF OUR HEALTH

01:24:34.503 --> 01:24:37.439 region:rollup2
CENTERS WE WORKED DIRECTLY WITH

01:24:36.138 --> 01:24:39.374 region:rollup2
PLANNED PARENTHOOD AND THAT'S

01:24:37.439 --> 01:24:41.109 region:rollup2
FRANKLY WHERE --

01:24:39.374 --> 01:24:43.779 region:rollup2
OUR RELATIONSHIPS ARE TO FOR THE

01:24:41.109 --> 01:24:45.647 region:rollup2
SERVICE SO --

01:24:43.779 --> 01:24:48.583 region:rollup2
WE'VE NOT HAD TO DEAL WITH IT --

01:24:45.647 --> 01:24:50.485 region:rollup2
THE CONCERN OF COURSE IS IS WE

01:24:48.583 --> 01:24:51.587 region:rollup2
HAVE NO IDEA HOW MUCH RISK THERE

01:24:50.485 --> 01:24:52.187 region:rollup2
WILL BE.

01:24:51.587 --> 01:24:55.123 region:rollup2
I'M IN TERMS OF MEETING DEMAND

01:24:52.187 --> 01:24:57.592 region:rollup2
--

01:24:55.123 --> 01:24:57.960 region:rollup2
THEY WERE NOT SURE THERE'S AN

01:24:57.592 --> 01:25:00.295 region:rollup2
UNMET NEED --

01:24:57.960 --> 01:25:01.730 region:rollup2
ON MOST OF OUR CAMPUSES WE'VE

01:25:00.295 --> 01:25:03.131 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY TRAPPED ON THE NUMBER

01:25:01.730 --> 01:25:04.166 region:rollup2
OF STUDENTS THAT COME INTO OUR

01:25:03.131 --> 01:25:05.601 region:rollup2
HEALTH CENTER.

01:25:04.166 --> 01:25:07.703 region:rollup2
AND THE ONES THAT WE HAVE BEEN

01:25:05.601 --> 01:25:09.171 region:rollup2
ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY --

01:25:07.703 --> 01:25:13.175 region:rollup2
REFERRED TO PLANNED PARENTHOOD

01:25:09.171 --> 01:25:15.577 region:rollup2
FOR THIS FOR THE SERVICE AND WE

01:25:13.175 --> 01:25:16.712 region:rollup2
WE DON'T SEE THAT THERE'S A HUGE

01:25:15.577 --> 01:25:18.013 region:rollup2
NEED FOR THE S. --

01:25:16.712 --> 01:25:20.148 region:rollup2
ALTHOUGH WERE SUPPORTIVE OF THE

01:25:18.013 --> 01:25:21.350 region:rollup2
SERVICE BECAUSE WE SO A TAPE THE

01:25:20.148 --> 01:25:23.785 region:rollup2
SERVICE WITH OUR COMMUNITY

01:25:21.350 --> 01:25:26.488 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS.

01:25:23.785 --> 01:25:27.556 region:rollup2
MISTER CHAIR MASK A QUESTION YET

01:25:26.488 --> 01:25:29.391 region:rollup2
DO ANY OF YOUR STERN'S COURT

01:25:27.556 --> 01:25:31.293 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY HAVE TO SEEK OF

01:25:29.391 --> 01:25:32.260 region:rollup2
TREATMENT FROM A EMERGENCY ROOM

01:25:31.293 --> 01:25:34.963 region:rollup2
NOW [inaudible]

01:25:32.260 --> 01:25:36.732 region:rollup2
OF COURSE.

01:25:34.963 --> 01:25:38.467 region:rollup2
SO THIS WOULD BE NOT ENTIRELY

01:25:36.732 --> 01:25:39.768 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT FROM A STUDENT WHO HAS

01:25:38.467 --> 01:25:40.969 region:rollup2
TO GO TO AN EMERGENCY ROOM WHO

01:25:39.768 --> 01:25:44.706 region:rollup2
MAYBE WENT TO THE HEALTH CARE

01:25:40.969 --> 01:25:46.908 region:rollup2
CENTER. FOR SOMETHING ELSE.

01:25:44.706 --> 01:25:47.843 region:rollup2
I I THINK THAT'S ABSOLUTELY TRUE

01:26:03.692 --> 01:26:08.964 region:rollup2
I DO THINK ON THE ISSUE OF

01:26:11.366 --> 01:26:14.469 region:rollup2
THAT THE RISK I I LOOK AT

01:26:12.968 --> 01:26:17.406 region:rollup2

01:26:14.469 --> 01:26:18.740 region:rollup2
FROM MORE OF A PERSPECTIVE.

01:26:17.406 --> 01:26:21.209 region:rollup2
WHAT HAPPENS --

01:26:18.740 --> 01:26:23.045 region:rollup2

01:26:27.916 --> 01:26:30.819 region:rollup2
DON'T KNOW.

01:26:29.117 --> 01:26:33.455 region:rollup2
I HAVEN'T HEARD OF A ARE WE

ANY OF THE PROCEDURES PROVIDED

01:26:47.135 --> 01:26:52.074 region:rollup2
THERE IF THE PROCEDURE IS

01:26:49.171 --> 01:26:52.808 region:rollup2
PROVIDED SOMEWHERE ELSE IT'S

01:26:52.074 --> 01:26:54.609 region:rollup2
LESS RISK FOR A FEW MINUTES.

01:26:52.808 --> 01:26:56.445 region:rollup2

YEARS GOING FORWARD --

BECAUSE ITHINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA

01:46:11.098 --> 01:46:13.567 region:rollup2
JUST LIKE A LOT OF THINGS WE DO

01:46:12.299 --> 01:46:15.336 region:rollup2

TAKES AN EFFORT.

01:46:28.716 --> 01:46:31.452 region:rollup2
I THINK THREE YEARS A TROLLEY

01:46:30.150 --> 01:46:32.853 region:rollup2
PROBABLY GO.

01:46:31.452 --> 01:46:34.255 region:rollup2

01:46:32.853 --> 01:46:36.056 region:rollup2
THREE YEARS IN THIS IS DONE BUT

01:46:34.255 --> 01:46:37.658 region:rollup2
I WOULD SUGGEST THAT THAT.

01:46:36.056 --> 01:46:39.460 region:rollup2
YOU YOU TAKE US FORWARD

01:46:37.658 --> 01:46:40.761 region:rollup2

01:46:44.331 --> 01:46:47.601 region:rollup2
THEN THERE'S GOING TO BE --

01:46:46.033 --> 01:46:48.736 region:rollup2
PROBABLY HEARING THREE YEARS

01:46:47.601 --> 01:46:50.070 region:rollup2
FROM NOW THAT WILL NOT ALLOW US

01:46:48.736 --> 01:46:51.872 region:rollup2
TO GO FORWARD.

01:46:50.070 --> 01:46:54.041 region:rollup2

01:46:51.872 --> 01:46:56.310 region:rollup2
TO OUR RESIDENTS IN NOW AND I

01:46:54.041 --> 01:46:57.411 region:rollup2

PROJECTS TO OUTSTRIP THIS

02:02:41.287 --> 02:02:44.324 region:rollup2
FUNDING THIS IS CERTAINLY A STEP

02:02:43.022 --> 02:02:46.025 region:rollup2
IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION IT'S BEEN

02:02:44.324 --> 02:02:46.659 region:rollup2
AGAIN SINCE TWO THOUSAND SIX

02:02:46.025 --> 02:02:47.227 region:rollup2

A GENERAL OBLIGATION BOND TO

02:02:47.227 --> 02:02:51.664 region:rollup2
WORK WITH.

02:02:49.762 --> 02:02:54.167 region:rollup2
NOW THERE'S ANOTHER BOND --

SOMETIMES I BECOME.

02:02:57.403 --> 02:03:01.140 region:rollup2
CONCERNED IF WE GO TO THE PUBLIC

02:02:58.872 --> 02:03:03.076 region:rollup2
TOO OFTEN THAT WE WILL GET WHAT

02:03:01.140 --> 02:03:04.377 region:rollup2
WE REALLY WANT INSIDE NOT SURE

02:03:03.076 --> 02:03:05.612 region:rollup2
WHETHER THERE'S BEEN AN EFFORT.

02:03:10.717 --> 02:03:14.020 region:rollup2
MUCH MORE BUT NONE THE LESS IS

02:03:12.819 --> 02:03:16.389 region:rollup2
