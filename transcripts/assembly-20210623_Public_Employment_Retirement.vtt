00:44:08.612 --> 00:44:11.315
TO MAKE OUR GOVERNMENT WORK.

00:44:11.382 --> 00:44:13.283
THERE DISADVANTAGED SO WE'RE

00:44:13.350 --> 00:44:16.987
TRYING TO DO. IF DREAMLAND A

00:44:17.054 --> 00:44:20.724
GRIEVANCE PROCESS. WE ALLOW THE

00:44:20.791 --> 00:44:24.028
EXCLUDED EMPLOYEES. AFTER

00:44:24.094 --> 00:44:26.063
THEY'VE EXHAUSTED THE NORMAL

00:44:26.130 --> 00:44:29.433
GRIEVANCE PROCESS. THEY CAN

00:44:29.500 --> 00:44:33.003
REQUEST ARBITRATION. I'M NOT

00:44:33.070 --> 00:44:34.638
HISTORICALLY BEEN A FAN OF

00:44:34.705 --> 00:44:37.541
ARBITRATION BUT IN THIS CASE I

00:44:37.608 --> 00:44:40.177
SEE ITS APPLICATION. THE

00:44:40.244 --> 00:44:41.979
CLASSROOM POLICIES THAT ARE

00:44:42.046 --> 00:44:44.848
MOST DESERVING. OF THAT BENEFIT

00:44:44.915 --> 00:44:52.556
NOW. THE AND AS THE INDIVIDUALS

00:44:52.623 --> 00:44:55.025
WITHIN A SPIRE THE GREATER

00:44:55.092 --> 00:44:58.862
RESPONSIBILITY MANAGEMENT. THEY

00:44:58.929 --> 00:45:00.864
CAN HAVE SOME HOPE THAT THEY

00:45:00.931 --> 00:45:04.468
WON'T BE SO LONELY. AS I SAY I

00:45:04.535 --> 00:45:06.503
THINK THE INTEREST OF THE-

00:45:06.570 --> 00:45:10.074
APARTMENTS FINANCE IN HR WITH

00:45:10.140 --> 00:45:10.607

MAINTAIN THEIR OWN. LEVERAGE IN

00:45:12.242 --> 00:45:15.245
THE PROCESS. BUT THEY'RE NOT

00:45:15.312 --> 00:45:16.647
THAT MANY OF THE EXCLUDED

00:45:16.713 --> 00:45:19.650
EMPLOYEES. AND I DO NOT THINK

00:45:19.716 --> 00:45:20.884
THAT THIS WOULD BE AN ONEROUS

00:45:20.951 --> 00:45:25.722

CAN BE A RE EXAMINATION IF WE

00:45:32.963 --> 00:45:33.464
DON'T THINK THIS IS WORKING

00:45:33.530 --> 00:45:38.535
WELL. IN FIVE YEARS HALF. BUT

00:45:38.602 --> 00:45:41.071
IT WILL SPARE US I WOULD ARGUE

00:45:41.138 --> 00:45:43.941
NEEDLESS LITIGATION. AND I

00:45:44.007 --> 00:45:47.077
THINK THE DISADVANTAGE THAT

00:45:47.144 --> 00:45:51.415
PLEASE EXPLODED EMPLOYEES FEEL.

00:45:51.482 --> 00:45:54.184

00:47:12.663 --> 00:47:14.831
LITIGATION IS VERY EXPENSIVE.

00:47:14.898 --> 00:47:17.000

01:25:22.217 --> 01:25:23.084
COMMENTS OF BOTH MY COLLEAGUES

01:25:23.151 --> 01:25:26.254
I THINK- EXORCISMS EXISTS TO

01:25:26.321 --> 01:25:28.056
PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR PEOPLE

01:25:28.122 --> 01:25:29.891
COMMITTED TO PUBLIC SERVICE.

01:25:29.958 --> 01:25:33.261
THAT THEY CAN- ENJOY RETIREMENT

01:25:33.328 --> 01:25:35.563
AND SECURITY RETIREMENT WELL

01:25:35.630 --> 01:25:36.464
THAT'S A BENEFACTION FOR THEM

01:25:36.531 --> 01:25:38.633
WELL THAT'S A GOOD THING FOR

01:25:38.700 --> 01:25:39.267
THEM IS ACTUALLY VERY IMPORTANT

01:25:39.334 --> 01:25:40.969
FOR THE ECONOMY. BECAUSE THAT

01:25:41.035 --> 01:25:43.137
MEANS EVEN A DOWNTURN. A SENIOR

01:25:43.204 --> 01:25:44.572
PUBLIC EMPLOYEE CAN ACTUALLY

01:25:44.639 --> 01:25:47.141
OPT TO RETIRE- FOR WHATEVER

01:25:47.208 --> 01:25:49.110
REASON THE MOTIVATES THIS OPENS

01:25:49.177 --> 01:25:49.944
UP NEW JOBS TO PEOPLE IN THE

01:25:50.011 --> 01:25:51.746
ORGANIZATION. SO THAT IN

01:25:51.813 --> 01:25:54.482
GENERAL PENSION SYSTEMS ARE

01:25:54.549 --> 01:25:56.217
GOOD FOR THE WHOLE ECONOMY.

01:25:56.284 --> 01:25:57.318
THEY ALLOW FOR THE RENEWAL OF

01:25:57.385 --> 01:25:58.887
ORGANIZATIONS BRINGING PEOPLE

01:25:58.953 --> 01:26:01.623
AND SO. MY POINT IS THAT

01:26:01.689 --> 01:26:04.025
ACTUALLY THIS IS A- THERE IS A

01:26:04.092 --> 01:26:05.460
PUBLIC BENEFITS ARE BY THESE

01:26:05.527 --> 01:26:07.128
ORGANIZATIONS AND THE GENERAL

01:26:07.195 --> 01:26:09.597
HEALTH OF THE LAW. IS TO

01:26:09.664 --> 01:26:10.665
SUPPORT THE WORKER AND TAKE THE

01:26:10.732 --> 01:26:12.166
BURDEN OFF THEM PROVIDE THEM

01:26:12.233 --> 01:26:15.436
WITH BENEFITS. IF WE DON'T HAVE

01:26:15.503 --> 01:26:18.573
A FIX LIKE THIS. IT SORT OF

01:26:18.640 --> 01:26:21.042
PUTS ON THE WORKER. THE BURDEN

01:26:21.109 --> 01:26:23.878
OF THE MISCALCULATION AND I

01:26:23.945 --> 01:26:26.514
AGREE- IT HELPS PEOPLE PLAN

01:26:26.581 --> 01:26:28.516
THEIR BENEFITS AS MY OTHER

01:26:28.583 --> 01:26:31.085
COLLEAGUES JUST STATED AND IT

01:26:31.152 --> 01:26:33.788
ALSO. I THINK THE ONE PERSON IS

01:26:33.855 --> 01:26:35.256
REALLY MONITORING THEIR THE

01:26:35.323 --> 01:26:36.758
STATE OF THEIR RETIREMENT WHAT

01:26:36.824 --> 01:26:37.659
THEY PROJECT FOR THE RETIREMENT

01:26:37.725 --> 01:26:39.727
IS THE WORKER TRYING TO MEASURE

01:26:39.794 --> 01:26:41.496
WHAT THEY WISH TO DO. I

01:26:41.563 --> 01:26:42.764
APPRECIATE THEIR FOR THE FACT

01:26:42.830 --> 01:26:44.365
THAT IN THE BILL SECTION ONE

01:26:44.432 --> 01:26:45.833
YOU ACTUALLY HAVE EXAMPLE

01:26:45.900 --> 01:26:47.902
FIREFIGHTER THAT THOUGHT IT WAS

01:26:47.969 --> 01:26:49.370
ON TRACK AND IN FIVE YEARS IN

01:26:49.437 --> 01:26:50.905
RETIREMENT. THEY TRY TO RE

01:26:50.972 --> 01:26:53.074
COMPUTE FULL MONEY BACK. THIS

01:26:53.141 --> 01:26:54.742
WAY ABSENCE INDIVIDUAL APPLE

01:26:54.809 --> 01:26:56.878
KERR. AND FOR THE PERSON'S NOT

01:26:56.945 --> 01:26:58.913
RETIRED. IF THERE WAS A

01:26:58.980 --> 01:27:00.715
MATERIAL ERROR THAT HAD COME TO

01:27:00.782 --> 01:27:02.483
LIGHT. THEY ACTED IN LIKE IT

01:27:02.550 --> 01:27:03.585
THEY MIGHT CONSIDER VOTE WITH

01:27:03.651 --> 01:27:05.053
THEIR FEET AND SEEK ANOTHER

01:27:05.119 --> 01:27:06.955
THAT'S RIGHT SETTING IN WHICH

01:27:07.021 --> 01:27:08.489
TO WORK. FOR RETIREMENT

01:27:08.556 --> 01:27:10.525
INTEREST AND- SO ON EVERY LEVEL

01:27:10.592 --> 01:27:12.760
THIS IS VERY VERY BAD FOR FOLKS

01:27:12.827 --> 01:27:14.495
IN THE WORKFORCE. AND I AGREE

01:27:14.562 --> 01:27:16.998
IT IS A MATTER OF FAIRNESS ND

01:27:17.065 --> 01:27:18.499
TO GET IT RIGHT THE FIRST TIME

01:27:18.566 --> 01:27:23.004
SO I JOIN IN SUPPORT. OF THIS

01:27:23.071 --> 01:27:24.839
BILL IS OUR EMOTIONAL DID YOU.

01:27:24.906 --> 01:27:27.642
MOTION MAY. SECOND EVOLUTION A

01:27:27.709 --> 01:27:29.010

01:27:29.077 --> 01:27:30.445
BRING THIS BILL FOR THIS

01:27:30.511 --> 01:27:33.314
IMPORTANT DETECTOR OF THE THIS-

01:27:33.381 --> 01:27:35.450
WEIRD IT DEFINED BENEFIT. YEAH

01:27:35.516 --> 01:27:36.417
THAT'S THE BIGGEST THING

01:27:36.484 --> 01:27:37.285
DEFINED BENEFIT YOU WORK A

01:27:37.352 --> 01:27:39.387
CERTAIN TIME. AND YOU TOLD ME

01:27:39.454 --> 01:27:40.455
TO MAKE THE SALARY TO COME

01:27:40.521 --> 01:27:41.923
BACK. IT'S REALLY DISHEARTENING

01:27:41.990 --> 01:27:44.058
AND IN SOME CASES AND WE THINK

01:27:44.125 --> 01:27:46.160
ABOUT THIS THE AVERAGE PERS

01:27:46.227 --> 01:27:49.464
RETIREMENT. IS THIRTY SIX

01:27:49.530 --> 01:27:50.098
THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH THAT'S

01:27:50.164 --> 01:27:51.199
ABOUT TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS.

01:27:51.265 --> 01:27:52.700
BEFORE TAXES THIRTY SIX

01:27:52.767 --> 01:27:53.835
THOUSAND DOLLARS BEFORE TAXES.

01:27:53.901 --> 01:27:55.203
IT'S NOT A LOT OF MONEY. IF

01:27:55.269 --> 01:27:58.473
YOUR TEACHER IT'S ABOUT TWENTY

01:27:58.539 --> 01:27:59.707
FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS. A YEAR

01:27:59.774 --> 01:28:00.908
AND MOST OF THOSE TEACHERS ARE

01:28:00.975 --> 01:28:03.678
WOMEN. SO TO REALLY GO BACK IN

01:28:03.745 --> 01:28:04.779
AND TRY TO CALL THAT MONEY BACK

01:28:04.846 --> 01:28:06.814
IS NOT RIGHT. THE ENTITIES THE

01:28:06.881 --> 01:28:08.983
CITIES COUNTIES. THEY GOT DO A

01:28:09.050 --> 01:28:10.985
BETTER JOB OF COMPUTING. SO

01:28:11.052 --> 01:28:12.286
WHAT DO YOU DOUBLE CHECK AND

01:28:12.353 --> 01:28:13.421
TRIPLE CHECK IT. IT'S ALL ON

01:28:13.488 --> 01:28:15.023
YOU. BUT TO PUT ON THE BACK OF

01:28:15.089 --> 01:28:17.225
THE EMPLOYEES IS WRONG- THIS

01:28:17.291 --> 01:28:18.993
BILL THIS BILL DOESN'T ENJOY A

01:28:19.060 --> 01:28:21.562

01:28:41.449 --> 01:28:42.283
QUADRUPLE CHECK THOSE

01:28:42.350 --> 01:28:43.885
CALCULATIONS. BECAUSE PEOPLE

01:28:43.951 --> 01:28:45.953
ARE MAKING LIFE DECISIONS BASED

01:28:46.020 --> 01:28:47.388
ON WHAT WE TELL THEM AND FOR

01:28:47.455 --> 01:28:49.357
ALL OF THE EMPLOYERS. THEY HAVE
