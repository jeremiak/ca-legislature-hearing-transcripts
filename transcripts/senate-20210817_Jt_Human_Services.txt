THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF COMMUNITY SERVICES AND DEVELOPMENT FOR CST TO FIND LOCAL ACTIVITIES AIMED AT REDUCING POVERTY. DESPITE OUR LARGE ECONOMY CALIFORNIA STRUGGLES TO DECREASE ITS POVERTY RATE AND MANY HAVE DIFFICULTY REACHING AND MAINTAINING FINANCIAL STABILITY. THE IMPACTS OF THE CORONA VIRUS PANDEMIC HAVE ONLY HIGHLIGHTED THE COMPLEX FACTORS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO POVERTY CAUSING INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES TO EXPERIENCE UNPRECEDENTED HARDSHIPS. WELL BOTH THE ASSEMBLY AND SENATE HUMAN SERVICES COMMITTEES HAVE MOVE FORWARD LEGISLATION AIMED AT ALLEVIATING THE CONDITIONS OF POVERTY. THERE IS MORE TO BE DONE TO HELP CALIFORNIANS STRUGGLE LEAD TO REACH SELF SUFFICIENCY. C. S. B. G.

HEARING THE PURPOSE OF TODAY'S HEARING IS TO REVIEW THE STATE'S PLAN FOR THE FEDERAL COMMUNITY SERVICES BLOCK GRANT WHICH IS. A LITTLE KNOWN BUT DECADES OLD FEDERAL% ANTI POVERTY PROGRAM. AS CHAIR OF THE SENATE HUMAN SERVICES COMMITTEE I AM DEDICATED TO THE CAUSE OF FIGHTING POVERTY. BUSH SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO SHELTER NUTRITIOUS FOOD HEALTHCARE AND OTHER BASIC. NECESSITIES OF LIFE. SADLY ACCORDING TO SOME ESTIMATES THIRTEEN MILLION PEOPLE ARE LIVING AT OR NEAR POVERTY AND ABOUT ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIANS LIVE IN DEEP POVERTY. ADDITIONALLY WITH OVER A HUNDRED SIXTY ONE THOUSAND PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS CALIFORNIA HAS THE LARGEST HOMELESS POPULATION IN THE COUNTRY ACCORDING TO THE FEDERAL TWENTY TWENTY POINT IN TIME COUNT. WITHIN THIS HOMELESS POPULATION OVER A HUNDRED AND THIRTEEN THOUSAND ARE UNSHELTERED. AND OVER TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND ARE PEOPLE. IN FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN. THIS DATA WAS COLLECTED AND REPORTED WAS BEFORE THE PANDEMIC SO I EXPECT THAT THESE NUMBERS TO BE EVEN HIGHER TODAY. THESE NUMBERS ARE TROUBLING AND I REMAIN PARTICULARLY CONCERNED WITH THE IMPACT OF DEEP POVERTY ON OUR CHILDREN AND OLDER ADULTS. WELL THERE ARE MANY FEDERAL STATE AND LOCALLY OPERATED PROGRAMS THAT FIGHT POVERTY S. THE C. S. B. G. IS SOMEWHAT UNIQUE IN THAT FEDERAL DOLLARS ARE PROVIDED AS A BLOCK GRANT WITH THE EXPECTATION THAT LOCAL PROVIDERS. WILL DETERMINE HOW THOSE FUNDS WILL BE SPENT WITH CERTAIN FEDERALLY MANDATED CRITERIA. KEY AMONG THOSE CRITERIAS THAT MEMBERS OF THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO FIND THEIR OWN COMMUNITY NEEDS AND C. S. B. G. FUNDS ARE USED TO PROVIDE SERVICES THAT ARE DEVELOPED AND OFFERED IN DIRECT RESPONSE TO COMMUNITY NEED. LOCAL ENTITIES WERE REQUIRED TO MEET PROGRAM OF FISCAL STANDARDS ARE GIVEN THE FLEXIBILITY TO DETERMINE THE TYPE OF SERVICES THAT ARE MOST NEEDED WITHIN THEIR OWN COMMUNITIES. C. S. B. G. FUNDS AN ARRAY OF SERVICES RANGING FROM MEETING THE BASIC HUMAN NEED FOR FOOD. TO MORE COMPLEX NEEDS LIKE AVOIDING HOMELESSNESS. OR HELPING INDIVIDUALS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS FIND HOUSING. ADDITIONALLY THE FLEXIBILITY OF C. S. B. G. ALLOWS ELIGIBLE ENTITIES TO BE NOBLE DURING A CRISIS. DURING OUR LAST YEAR'S BG HEARING WE HEARD FROM LOCAL ENTITIES THAT RESPONDED TO THE MASSIVE FIRES AND HOW C. S. B. G. FUNDS WERE USED TO PROVIDE FOOD SHELTER AND OTHER BASIC NECESSITIES. TODAY EXPECT WE WILL HEAR MORE ABOUT HOW C. S. B. G. FUNDS WERE RECENTLY USED. TO RESPOND TO LOCAL NEEDS DUE TO THE COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC THUS I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING MORE ABOUT HOW OUR LOCAL COMMUNITY ACTION AGENCY AGENCIES ARE RESPONSIVE TO COMMUNITY NEEDS AND HOW THE DEPARTMENT OF COMMUNITY SERVICES AND DEVELOPMENT WORKS TO SUPPORT THOSE EFFORTS WHILE ALSO OVERSEEING. PROPER ADMINISTRATION OF PRECIOUS FEDERAL DOLLARS IN PARTICULAR I AM INTERESTED IN HEARING MORE ABOUT HOW COMMUNITY ACTION AGENCIES ARE RESPONDING TO THE CALL THE NINETEEN PANDEMIC.

WHAT THE COMMUTER SERVICE BLOCK GRANT CELEBRATES FORTY YEARS THIS YEAR. THE COMMITTEE ACTION MOVEMENT IS FIFTY SIX YEARS STRONG. WATER RELIES ON DECADES OF EXPERIENCE IN EACH OF OUR COMMUNITIES THE COSTLY THRIVES TO ADAPT TO THE EVER CHANGING LANDSCAPE OF OUR FAMILIES. AND OUR COMMUNITIES. BEING A PARTNERSHIP THE CALIFORNIA CST IS SERVING AS A LEAD DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION FOR ALL AGENCIES STATEWIDE. CALC KEVIN HAS THE UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE A MEASURE THE LANDSCAPE OF OUR GREAT STATE. THE NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITIES WE SERVE. WELL YOU HEAR MASS TESTIMONY TODAY ABOUT THE FAMILIES WE SERVE HOW AGENCIES HAD A GREATER NEED. TO THEM THAN EVER BEFORE DURING THIS UNPRECEDENTED PANDEMIC. IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE COMMUNITY SERVICE BLOCK GRANT. IS VITAL TO LEADING OUR COMMUNITIES ON THE PASSIVE DIVERSITY EQUITY AND INCLUSION. ALL WAS STILL SERVING OUR FAMILIES LOW INCOME DIRECTLY. COMEDIA ACTION IS BUILT ON THE PREMISE OF WHAT YOU DO FOR US. MUST INCLUDE US WE'RE NOT SURE THE FOR US. OUR AGENCIES ARE EXTREMELY KNOWLEDGEABLE OF THE COMMUNITY NEEDS IN THE COMMUTER STRAKES. AND HOW TO BEST COMBINED PRIVATE PUBLIC RESOURCES TO ENSURE THEY DEVELOP THRIVING COMMUNITIES. THEY KNOW WHAT HOUSING NEEDS ARE PRESENT WHAT WORKFORCE TRAINING IS NEEDED FOR BUSINESSES TO THRIVE AND TO EXPAND. WHAT COMMUNITIES LIKE HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH ACCESS WE'RE LACKING NUTRITION SLOWS ALL DEVELOPMENT AREAS. OUR FLEXIBILITY IN THE COMMUTER SERVICE BLOCK GRANT ALLOWED AGENCIES TO SERVE FAMILIES NOT ONLY HAVE ACCESS TO SNAP. OR FOOD VOUCHERS BUT ALSO CREATING THE PLACE TO GET THAT HEALTHY FOOD. IT CREATES ACCESS TO TRANSPORTATION VOUCHERS WANT THE SAME TIME MAKING SURE THEY'RE SUCCESSFUL TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE TO EVEN USE THOSE VOUCHERS. THEY ADVOCATE FOR EQUALITY AND EQUITY IN THE DEVELOPMENT AND ACCESS. THE FIVE FOR PEOPLE THEY DON'T HAVE A VOICE IN THEIR COMMUNITIES WELL THOSE SAME EXACT PEOPLE ARE THRIVING WORKFORCE THAT MAKE OUR COMMUNITY SUCCESSFUL. ECKEL DEVELOPMENT IS LED BY CCG AGENCIES DO THE UNIQUE NATURE OF OUR AGENCIES. INCLUDING THE FACT THAT EACH OF THEM ARE LED BY PROPERTY BOARD STRUCTURE. AS MENTIONED EACH AGENCY BOARD OF DIRECTORS CONSIST OF A PUBLIC PRIVATE IN A LOW INCOME SECTOR. THIS IS EXTREMELY VITAL IN THE WAY THEIR AGENCIES CAN BUILD. DEVELOP AND ADAPT PROGRAMMING IN OUR COMMUNITIES. DIVERSE LEADERSHIP ALLOW CSG ENTITIES TO CREATE A SPACE IN WHICH FAMILY SERVICE. HURDLES ROADBLOCKS AND EVEN DELAYS. CAN POSSIBLY BE IDENTIFIED ANDREAS PROACTIVELY. DURING PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT RATHER THAN REACTIVELY AFTER THE SERVICES HAVE BEGUN. TO HAVE SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF OPPORTUNITIES A PROGRAM MUST HAVE TWO THINGS. FUNDING AND ACCESS AS WE ARE MORE THAN AWARE FUNDING IS AT AN ALL TIME HIGH RIGHT NOW DURING THIS CRISIS. WHAT IS ALSO EVIDENT ACROSS THE STAGE DURING THIS CRISIS. INCLUDING PROGRAMS LIKE EMERGE RENTAL ASSISTANCE AND UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS. IS THAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO FOCUS OUR EFFORTS ON INCREASING ACCESS TO THAT FUNDING. THIS IS MARCY S. B. G. ELIGIBLE ENTITIES AND THEIR LEADERSHIP ARE VITAL TO THE STATE. THIS BG STAY PLAN. BUT THE FUNDING IN PLACE TO ENSURE THE TEAMS OF LOCAL VOICES ALREADY. EXPERIENCING AVAILABLE TO PUT POLICIES INTO PRACTICE. MORE EFFICIENTLY AND MORE EFFECTIVELY BECAUSE THEY ARE CONSTANTLY ACTUALLY ON THE GROUND IN THE COMMUNITIES OF THE- YOU'LL HEAR MORE TODAY ABOUT MORE THOSE SUCCESSES THROUGHOUT THIS PANDEMIC.

AS WELL AS LEAD THE COUNTRY TO WORK FOR FAMILIES COMMUNITIES THANK YOU FOR THAT PLEASE SHARE THIS INFORMATION TODAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. AND GOVERNANCE OF OUR GREAT STATE. THANK YOU DAVID. NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM JEREMY TO BIAS THE- CEO FOR CAL KAPPA. GOOD DAY THANK YOU JOINT COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND CHAIRS HER TADO AN CALDERON FOR INVITING US TO SPEAK TO THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE HEARING ABOUT COMMUNITY SERVICE BLOCK GRANT PROGRAM. MY NAME IS JEREMY TO VICE I'M BOARD PRESIDENT OF CAL KAPPA IN CEO OF COMMUNITY ACTION PARTNERSHIP. OF KERN COUNTY. THE PAST EIGHTEEN MONTHS OF CHALLENGES TO WAYS NONE OF US COULD HAVE IMAGINED BEFORE WE FIRST HEARD OF COVERT NINETEEN. THE HEALTH IMPACTS ILLNESS AND LOSS OF LIFE HAVE BEEN NOTHING SHORT OF A TRAGEDY. BUT THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA HAVE ALSO FACED AN ECONOMIC CRISIS CRISIS OF MASSIVE PROPORTIONS. AND THOSE WITH THE LEAST HAVE BEEN HIT THE HARDEST. AND THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE WE SERVE. THERE ARE SIXTY PRIVATE NONPROFIT AND GOVERNMENT AGENCIES IN CALIFORNIA WHO POWERED BY CS BG HELP THOSE IN NEED EVERY DAY. WE CREATE A NETWORK OF SERVICES ALLOW INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES. TO BUILD THE RESOURCES SKILLS AND OPPORTUNITIES THAT WILL HELP MAKE THEM INDEPENDENT STRONG AND PROSPEROUS. AND THAT'S BEEN A MORE DIFFICULT MISSION THIS YEAR FOR SURE. WE HAVE BEEN BLESSED TO HAVE OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF COMMUNITY SERVICES AND DEVELOPMENT. TO RELY ON AS WE FOUGHT FOR OUR CLIENTS THIS PAST YEAR. WHAT HAS MADE THESE PARTNERSHIPS SUCCEED IS THE FLEXIBILITY PROVIDED THROUGH THE C. S. B. G. PROGRAM. COMMUNITY ACTION AGENCIES DO OUR WORK FROM THE STREETS OF EVERY COMMUNITY IN CALIFORNIA LABORING WHERE THE NEED IS GREATEST. WE PLAN AN ADAPTER WORK TO WHAT WE SEE ON THOSE STREETS EVERY DAY. AND THAT IS WHERE THE LOCAL FOCUS OF C. S. B. G. PROGRAM TRULY SHINES. IS ADAPTABLE TO EVERY COMMUNITIES NEEDS THAT LOCAL FOCUS IS CRITICAL TO OUR SUCCESS IN THIS BAKED INTO THE VERY DNA OF OUR NETWORK. COMMUNITY ACTION AGENCIES ARE GUIDED BY DIVERSE AND INCLUSIVE BOARDS MADE UP OF AN EQUAL NUMBER OF LOW INCOME CLIENTS PRIVATE SECTOR COMMUNITY LEADERS AND ELECTED OFFICIALS. THE PEOPLE WE SERVE ARE AS DIVERSE AS THE STATE AND THEY GET AN EQUAL SAY AND HOW WE DESIGN AND RUN THE PROGRAMS THAT SERVE THEM. ANOTHER ANOTHER CRUCIAL ASPECT OF THE C. S. B. G. PROGRAM. MAKES THE FLEXIBILITY I JUST TALKED ABOUT POSSIBLE AND THAT IS ACCOUNTABILITY. COMMUNITY ACTION AGENCIES ARE REQUIRED TO TRACK OUR USE OF C. S. B. G. FUNDS. GATHER DETAILED PUBLIC OPINIONS ABOUT OUR SERVICES CONSIDER COMMUNITY NEEDS AND REPORT EXTENSIVELY TO OUR PARTNERS AT CST. WE MUST SHOW THAT WE ARE LATE LASER FOCUSED ON DOING THE BEST WE CAN TO HELP OVERCOME THE CONDITIONS OF POVERTY IN OUR COMMUNITIES. MOST OF OUR LOCAL AGENCIES HAVE BEEN DOING THIS SINCE THE NINETEEN SIXTIES. AND THAT HAS HELPED US BUILD STRONG ROBUST ORGANIZATIONS WITH DEEP ROOTS IN OUR COMMUNITIES. AND THAT IN TURN HAS EXPANDED THE IMPACT WE HAVE IN OUR COMMUNITIES. WE CAN TAKE ON PROJECTS NOBODY ELSE IS EQUIPPED TO DO AT THE SAME TIME WE SUPPORT THE BROADER NONPROFIT NETWORKS IN OUR COMMUNITIES. AND FOSTER COLLABORATIONS THE MULTIPLY THE GOOD WORK OF EVERYONE INVOLVED. C. S. B. G. COMPLIMENTS OF FLEXIBILITY AND GIVES US THE POWER TO MOVE FAST WHEN CRISIS STRIKES. NOTHING HAS PROVED THAT BETTER THAN THIS PAST YEAR. AS AN EXAMPLE THE CAP K. FOOD BANK IS THE CENTRAL FOOD DISTRIBUTION HUB FOR EIGHT THOUSAND SQUARE MILES OF TERRITORY IN KERN COUNTY. WE HAVE A LARGER CITY LAND AREA TO COVER IN SIX U. S. STATES. AND WE DO THIS RELYING ON A NETWORK OF MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED FIFTY COMMUNITY CHURCHES FOOD PANTRIES AND NONPROFITS TO GET THE FOOD INTO THE HANDS OF THOSE WHO NEED IT. SADLY WHEN THE PANDEMIC HIT ME THOSE PARTNERS CLOSE OUR DOORS. SO WE MOVE FAST WE CONNECTED WITH LOCAL HIGH SCHOOLS AND CREATE A DAILY DRIVE THRU FOOD DISTRIBUTIONS AND EMPTY HIGH SCHOOL PARKING LOTS. WE DID A CERTAIN ERROR DETERMINATION AND C. S. B. G. SUPPORT. AT ARE YOU CENTERS PROVIDING CHILDREN SAFE SOCIALLY DISTANCE PLACES TO ATTEND VIRTUAL SCHOOL WAS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WORKING OR UNEMPLOYMENT ECONOMIC CRISIS FOR MANY OF OUR FAMILIES. R. TO YOU CENTERS UCSB G. FUNDS TO MODIFY DESKS DESKS WITH PLEXIGLASS SHIELDS AND MOVING THEM IN THE GYM SO WE COULD SEPARATE THE CHILDREN. AND KEEP THEM SAFE WHILE OUR STAFF SUPPORTED THEM WITH TUTORING AND HOMEWORK ASSISTANCE. THESE ARE JUST TWO EXAMPLES AND I CAN PROMISE YOU THAT EVERY SINGLE COMMUNITY ACTION AGENCY IN THE STATE HAS A LIST OF SIMILAR STORIES. BUT C. S. B. G. THAN JUST TRYING DURING COVERT NINETEEN. FUNDS FROM C. S. B. G. EMERGENCY RESERVES HELP CAP K. RESPOND SWIFTLY TO A MAJOR SEVEN POINT ONE EARTHQUAKE IN RIDGECREST ON JULY FIFTH TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. WE UTILIZE C. S. B. G. EMERGENCY FUNDS FOR CST TO SWIFTLY GATHER TRUCKS AND SUPPLIES AND DELIVER TO A COMMUNITY THAT WAS IN NEED. C. S. B. G. CAN ALSO BE A CRITICAL TOOL FOR THE COMMUNITIES WHO HAVE BEEN DEVASTATED BY WILDFIRES. IN CLOSING I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL AGAIN FOR LETTING US SHARE STORIES AND EMPHASIZED THE VITAL IMPORTANCE OF C. S. B. G. PROGRAM. TO OUR STATE IN OUR COMMUNITIES. AS YOU REVIEW THE DRAFT C. S. B. G. STATE PLAN. IF THERE'S ONE THING WE'VE LEARNED IN THE PAST EIGHTEEN MONTHS. IT'S THAT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT IS COMING NEXT. WHAT WE DO KNOW IS WITH THE HELP OF C. S. B. G. WE WILL BUILD A WAY TO GET THROUGH WHATEVER WE FACE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU JEREMY I'D LIKE TO NOW OPEN THE FLOOR TO- ANY QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MANY QUESTIONS FOR OUR PANELISTS. SENATOR PAN. IS IT THANKS VERY MUCH AND REALLY APPRECIATE THE- PRESENTATIONS- ABOUT- THE VARIOUS PROGRAMS I DID HAVE A QUESTION IN TERMS OF- TERMS OF THE PEOPLE SERVE THAT WAS THE BACKGROUND PAPER AND- AND I KNOW THAT THE- ME SERVICE BLOCK GRANT COVERS A LOT OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF ACTIVITIES- BUT- AND- CERTAINLY- ADDRESSES A DIVERSE POPULATION- BUT I WOULD ALSO MAKE NOTE. THAT FOR EXAMPLE- IN THE BACKGROUND PAPER- ONLY FOUR POINT 9% OF- THE RECIPIENTS WERE ASIAN OTHER 29% RUN DOWN SO I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH IS MIXED IN THEIR SELF- THE GIVEN THE LARGE NUMBER OF- AND NOW IN ITS- TERMS OF JUST SERVICE. DATA COLLECTION IN TERMS OF COMMUNITY SERVICE AND SO FORTH IS ARE THERE THINGS THAT- I MEAN I DON'T LIKE THREE MORE BURDENS ON. PROGRAMS BUT IS YOUR BILL IN A WAY WE CAN GET A BETTER- DATA COLLECTION ON WHO SERVED. AND MAYBE THAT'S DAVID SCRIBNER. I THANK YOU YES WE DO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS- AT THE NEED FOR INCREASED DATA COLLECTION AND IT IS SOMETHING THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS PRIORITIZED GOING FORWARD NOT ONLY FOR C. S. B. G. BUT ALSO ITS ENERGY PROGRAMS WE ARE WORKING ON THE ON GOING IT SOLUTIONS TO INCREASE THAT DATA COLLECTION TO HELP NOT ONLY REPORT OUT SERVICES NOW COMES- BUT ALSO TO MAKE- SOLID TO DEPARTMENTAL LANE AND- DECISION MAKING FROM R. OR C. S. B. G. PARTNERS- I CAN'T ANSWER- RIGHT NOW WHITE THERE IS JUST THE- THE OTHER- REPORTING ASPECTS OF IT I THINK IT IS JUST THE NATURE OF THE REPORTING THAT COMES FROM. A LOCAL AGENCIES- POTENTIALLY- GERMANY OR CAL KAPPA COULD- ALSO AT THEIR INSIGHTS YEARS WELL- BUT I DO KNOW THAT THIS IS BEN AND AN ONGOING EFFORT- NOT ONLY BY THE DEPARTMENT BUT ALSO THE US EAST REGION AGENCIES AS WELL TO- INCREASE THE- DATA COLLECTION. AND REPORTING. AND PERHAPS- I DON'T KNOW THE OTHER SPEAKER WANT TO JUST AFTER SOME OF THE- OF IN TERMS OF THE DATA REPORTING AND THEN ALSO OUTCOMES EVALUATION SO I NEED SOUNDS LIKE FROM YOUR PRESENTATIONS AND- BACKGROUND PAPER A LOT OF. GREAT WORK BEING. AS YOU TO BE MORE NIMBLE- SO WE'RE NOT INTERESTED IN WEIGHING YOU DOWN BUT I THINK UPDATE FROM THE STANDPOINT OF TRYING TO. LOOK AT THE OUTCOMES OF THE INVESTMENTS- TO BETTER TO BETTER ARTICULATE THEM I WOULD TRY TO HELP ALSO AND PERHAPS- AND IF THERE ARE. SOME COMMENTS FROM OTHER AND MISTER KNIGHT OR MISTER TO BIAS ABOUT- THE CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR- EVALUATION AND- DATA REPORTING. YES THIS IS DAVID KNIGHT WITH CAL CAP ABOUT BE HAPPY TO ANSWER SOME OF THE QUESTIONS. ARE FIRST OF ALL I DO HAVE EXPERIENCE OF WORKING WITH OUR NATIONAL ASSOCIATION WAS ACTUALLY THERE WHEN THEY STARTED THE DATA COLLECTION SYSTEM SO. CURRENTLY WE'RE UNDER THE SECOND MODEL OF THAT DATA COLLECTION HOW WE DO THAT NOW THAT IS SET. FROM OCS DIRECTLY AND HOW THEY DO THAT THEN WE HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO KIND OF CONTINUE AND EXPAND ON THAT. AND AS MR STRINGER SAID WE'RE WE'RE- WHAT. WHAT ADVANCED HEARING CALIFORNIA HOW WE DO THAT. SO JUST BASICALLY WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE DATA AND HOW WE USE THAT WAS FIRST ALL THE MOST IMPORTANT THING WE DO COLLECT IS THE DEMOGRAPHICS. OF ALL THE FAMILIES OF THE MAJORITY OF FAMILIES THAT WE SERVE. THERE ARE PROGRAMS THAT MAY BE YOU KNOW A TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM WHERE SOMEONE'S USING. NO PUBLIC TRANSIT WHERE YOU CAN GET ALL THE DEMOGRAPHICS ON EVERYBODY THAT GETS ON AND OFF OF. A PUBLIC VEHICLE- BUT FOR THE MOST PART WE DO COLLECT ALL DEMOGRAPHICS OF ALL THE FAMILIES THAT WE SERVE. AND WE'RE CONSTANTLY COMPARE THAT NOT JUST TO OUR POPULATIONS OF YOU WANNA LOOK AT SPECIFICALLY WITH THE ASIAN POPULATION IN CALIFORNIA- IT'S ROUGHLY ABOUT AS WE KNOW THAT IT'S ONLY NINE POINT 9% OF THE POVERTY POPULATION ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE PUMP. POPULATION THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO SERVE UP TO THIS YEAR WHICH IS ONLY A WE'RE ONLY CURRENTLY SERVING FOUR POINT NINE TO FIVE POINT GAP OF FOUR PERCENT. AND WE WE'RE VERY AWARE THAT UNDERSTANDING THAT IT'S HOW WE POPULATE. OUR AGENCIES THAT WE STAFF THOSE AGENCIES TO MAKE SURE THEY WERE IN THE CORRECT COMMUNITIES. SO THAT WERE MORE A LOT OF THAT WE CLOSELY WORK TO THAT. THE OTHER TWO PARTS OF R. IN REPORT ON THAT WE LOOK AT AND UNDERSTANDING OUR DATA. IS BOTH LOOKING AT OUR SERVICE DATA ENTERED HALFTIME DATA IN AND HOW THAT MATCHES TOGETHER. SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE MAKE SURE WE DO IS UNDERSTANDING THE PEOPLE TO COME INTO OUR OFFICE. AND WHAT SERVICES THEY RECEIVE. AND THEN ONE OF THOSE TIMES RECEIVE SERVICES ONE OF THE TYPE OF OUTCOMES THAT THEY HAVE. WE LOOK AT ALL DIFFERENT AREAS SO WE LOOK AT. YOUR POINT WE LOOK AT HOUSING WE LOOK AT EDUCATION ALL THOSE MAJOR OUTCOMES. THAT YOU SEE ACROSS WHETHER YOU'RE LOOKING AT A WORK FORCE PROGRAM. YOU LOOK AT A HOUSING PROGRAM WHATEVER IT MAY BE. SO WHAT WE DO WITH THAT INFORMATION IS BILLS SAY. WHO GOT THE SERVICE AND WHO HAD OUTCOME AND WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE IN THOSE PEOPLE SO. IT'S A PRETTY ADVANCED SYSTEM WE CAN DEFINITELY SUPPLY. THAT FULL REPORT TO YOU. ULTIMATELY WE TRY TO DO IS BREAK IT DOWN SO THAT IT'S A IT'S A SHORTER VERSION OF THAT REPORT- SO THERE'S NOT JUST SUCH A MASS AMOUNT OF INFORMATION. BUT DUE TO OUR AGENCIES USE THAT INFORMATION AS A PART OF THEIR NEEDS ASSESSMENT DISTRICTS ASSESSMENT. TO UNDERSTAND NOT ONLY THE POVERTY COPULATIONS IN CALIFORNIA. BUT HOW DOES IT CAN. THE POPULATION THAT WE SAW. IN SOME OF THOSE OUTCOMES THAT THEY HAVE. THANK THANK IF I CAN JUST FOLLOW UP THAT- AGAIN I REALLY. YOUR ACKNOWLEDGING THE FACT THAT THE ASIAN COMMUNITY AND I THINK THE KEY I CAN IS ONLY REPRESENTS POINT THREE PERCENT- IT'S REPORTED THAT HERE IT IS PERHAPS UNDERSERVED BY THIS PROGRAM- I WAS TO MAKE NOTE THAT- WITHIN THE ASIAN UMBRELLA THERE'S TREMENDOUS DIVERSITY AS WELL SO- PERHAPS LOOKING AT DISAGGREGATED SOME OF THE DATA I CAN. I THINK THERE'S MANY SUBGROUPS- OF THE- OF THE API COMMUNITIES THAT ARE PARTICULARLY- LOW INCOME AND POVERTY THAT WOULD BE SERVED BY THIS PROGRAM AND TO BE GOOD TO KNOW- TO WHAT DEGREE WE ARE REACHING TO THEM WHAT DEGREES LANGUAGE ACCESS ISSUE. IN THE PROGRAMS- TO IDENTIFY SOME OF THOSE BARRIERS AS TO WHY AS YOU POINTED OUT- IN YOUR TRIAL YOU KNOW. THAT- FORTUNATELY- YOU'RE ABOUT AT HALF OF THE- BOB. IT COULD BE SERVE- IN THE H. E. I. SO SO APPRECIATE THAT. BUT LOOK FOR TO ASSUME YOU KNOW WHAT TO MAKE HOW WE CAN MAKE PROGRESS ON IDENTIFIED THE BARRIERS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR TO HAVE ANY OTHER SENATOR ASSEMBLY MEMBER ARAMBULA. THANK THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I'M GONNA FOLLOW UP ON OUR POLITICS QUESTIONS FROM THE SENATE IF I CAN REGARDING OVERSIGHT. AND ALL- LOOK AT THE AGENDA IF I CANNOT AND ON PAGE FOUR FOR C. S. B. G. ELIGIBLE ENTITIES ONE OF THE REQUIREMENTS FOR THEM IS THAT THEY MAINTAIN A PERFORMANCE FOCUSED SYSTEM FOR ASSESSING AND REPORTING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS ANTI POVERTY STRATEGY. DO IS THERE A REPORT THAT IS GENERATED FROM THOSE WHO ARE- SUBMITTING TO THAT SYSTEM AND WHAT HASN'T SHOWN- REGARDING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR STATE DOLLARS IN THOSE. GO AHEAD YES THEY EVEN HAVE A CAP UP AGAIN SO THE PREFERRED SYSTEM THAT WE USE IS KNOWN AS ROMA WHICH IS RESULTS ORIENTED MANAGEMENT CAPABILITY IT WAS STARTED TWENTY ONE YEARS AGO- AFTER THE GOVERNMENT PERFORMANCE AND RESULTS ACT. IT'S BEEN SINCE EDITED UNDER PRESIDENT OBAMA WHEN HE DOUBLE DOWN ON THAT INITIATIVE AND SO WE ARE NOW IN ROME- WE CALL ROMA TWO POINT OO SORE THE NEXT GENERATION. SO MAJORITY OF AGENCIES ACROSS THE NATION AND ALL THE AGENCIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA USE THAT FORMAT- TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE MANAGING- AND THEY'RE ACCOUNTABLE BASED ON RESULTS NOT JUST ON SERVICES BUT WHAT HAPPENS BECAUSE OF THOSE SERVICES. THE MAJORITY OF AGENCIES ALL USE THAT SYSTEM WE HAVE A WHAT WE CALL PERFORMANCE STANDARDS- SO THERE IS ROUGHLY NINETY PERFORMANCE STANDARDS. THAT WERE SET BY THE NATIONAL IMPROVE BY. FED OCS AND ONE OF THOSE ARE TWO OF THOSE STANDARDS. I'LL HAVE TO DO WITH THAT PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM SO EVERY AGENCY MUST GO THROUGH THIS PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT. A CHECKLIST OR YOU KNOW EVALUATION TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR MEETING ALL THOSE STANDARDS INTO THOSE STANDARDS INCLUDES THE USE OF A MANAGEMENT SYSTEM OR RESULTS BASED SYSTEM. THE MAJORITY OF THOSE USE THAT ROAM ASSIST. IS THERE ANY REPORT THAT IS GENERATED FOR THE STATE LEGISLATURE TO EVALUATE AS WE ARE DETERMINING AND LOOKING AT. A STATE PLAN FOR THE NEXT TWO YEARS. HOW MUCH. WOULD YOU LIKE TO TAKE THAT ONE- YES THANK YOU DAVIS FROM THERE WAS THE IS THE- THERE IS AT THIS TIME NO- OFFICIAL REPORT FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS- THE DATA THAT'S REPORTED FROM LOCAL AGENCIES TO SEE S. B. AND THEN UP TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS USED- REPORT ON A YEAR BY YEAR BASIS. RIGHT NOW THE DEPARTMENT IS AWAITING FEDERAL HHS APPROVAL OF THE TWENTY TWENTY- DATA THAT WAS COLLECTED SO AT THIS TIME- WE COULD NOT COMPLETE AT COMPLY TWENTY NINETEEN AND TWENTY TWENTY REPORT FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO REVIEW SINCE WE DO NOT HAVE THE AUTHORITY FROM FEDERAL AGENTS JUST RELEASED THOSE THAT THAT AT THIS TIME- BUT AS SOON AS WE DO GET THAT DATA WE CAN COMPILE TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY REPORT. AFTER THE LEGISLATURE TO REVIEW. I THINK THAT IS AN IMPORTANT PIECE FOR US TO BE EVALUATING AS WE ARE CONSIDERING. CONTINUING OF THIS PROGRAM- I WOULD SUGGEST THAT THE INFORMATION IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO TWENTY NINETEEN WILL ALSO BE INFORMATIVE FOR US- I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT IF WE ARE COLLECTING THIS INFORMATION THAT WE IN THE LEGISLATURE ALSO RECEIVING IT. I'M I'M GOING TO TRANSITION NOW IF I CAN'T OF THE COMMUNITY NEEDS ASSESSMENT HI THIS QUESTION IS GOING TO AGAIN BE FOR THE DIRECTOR DAVID SCRIBNER. IN THE CONCLUSION OF THE HANDOUT THAT WAS GVEN TO US AND SAID THAT ALL AGENCIES HAVE COMPLETED THE REQUIRED COMMUNITY NEEDS ASSESSMENT. YOUR WORDS TODAY WAS THAT IT'S THIS COMMUNITY NEEDS ASSESSMENT THAT PROVIDES A COMPREHENSIVE PICTURE TO HELP TO INFORM THE ACTION PLAN. AND YET WHEN I'M LOOKING AT THE HAND OUT TODAY AND THE STATE PLAN WHAT. I'M READING FROM IT ON PAGE THREE AS A NEED FOR US TO ASSESS AND EVALUATE EMERGING COMMUNITY NEEDS I GUESS MY QUESTION IS. WHAT SHOWED FROM THAT COMMUNITY NEEDS ASSESSMENT AND IS THERE A REPORT FOR US AS THE LEGISLATURE TO EVALUATE. REGARDING WHAT THE AGENCIES ARE RECEIVING NOW I UNDERSTAND THE NEED FOR THE FLEXIBILITY IN BY THE LOCALS. ARE THE ONES TO PERFORM THIS NEEDS ASSESSMENT BUT AGAIN I BELIEVE IT'S AN IMPORTANT PIECE OF INFORMATION FOR US THE LEGISLATURE TO HAPPY FOR US. I APPRECIATE THE- THOSE COMMENTS IN THAT SUGGESTION- ABSOLUTELY- WE DO NOT HAVE A REPORT FROM THE DEPARTMENT TO PROVIDE THAT I THINK THAT- IN THE- STATE PLAN AND I THINK THAT THE STATEMENT IS MORE ABOUT THAT THERE ARE. I'M GOING TO URGENT NEEDS THAT CAN OCCUR FROM THE TIME THAT COMMUNITY NEEDS ASSESSMENTS HAVE BEEN DONE AND SUBMITTED TO THE DEPARTMENT AS PART OF THE STATE PLAN. THROUGHOUT THE TWO YEAR CYCLE THAT- THE C. S. B. G. PROGRAM WILL OPERATE UNDER THE STATE PLAN AND SO THAT. LOCAL CCG AGENCIES WILL MAINTAIN THEIR FLEXIBILITY AND WILL CONTINUALLY ASSESS THE NEEDS OF THE LOW INCOME POPULATIONS THAT THEY SERVE. TO ENSURE THAT CSU G. FUNDS IF THEY RECEIVE HER BEING ADMINISTERED TO ASK THE RESULTS AS A RESULT TO ANY EMERGENCIES THAT COULD HAPPEN- JOB RELATED TO WILDFIRES FOR EXAMPLE THAT WE NOW HAVE- CLOSURES UP IN EL DORADO COUNTY THAT COULD IMPACT- SOME C. S. B. G. AGENCIES THERE- AS WELL AS- ON GOING DROUGHT. AND SO WHILE THE STATE PLAN DOES LOOK AT THE COMMUNITY NEEDS ASSESSMENTS IN A POINT IN TIME- IT IS ALMOST AS IF A LIVING DOCUMENT THAT NEEDS TO BE A FLEXIBLE OVER TWO YEAR PERIOD- AND THAT THEY THEY WILL CONTINUE TO DO THIS COMMUNITY NEEDS ASSESSMENT. AGAIN FOR THE NEXT PLAN BUT WHY DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT- THE THAT YOUR DESIRE TO HAVE FOR THE LEGISLATURE DESIRE TO HAVE A REPORT OUT OF BY THE DEPARTMENT OR THE AGENCIES- AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN LOOK. TO- TO HANDLE HERE IN THE FUTURE. I ALSO A- WHAT YOU'RE- OF THE- NEEDS DURING THE PANDEMIC THE UNITED WAY WAS CONDUCTING. AND GIVING US INFORMATION ON A WEEK BY WEEK BASIS BASED ON WHAT COMMUNITY NEEDS WERE. BUT I DO THINK THERE'S AN ADVANTAGE FOR US TO TRACK OVER TIME WHAT HAS BEEN CHANGING AS WELL AND- HENCE WHY I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO HAVE THAT INFORMATION. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU SOMEONE- C. WE HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS- FIFTY SENATOR JOHNSON JR WITH- OKAY SENATOR HER TITLE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I MY QUESTION I THINK IT IS MORE FOR A DIRECTOR DAVID SCRIBNER- I KNOW THERE WAS A MENTION OF HOW THE FEDERAL FUNDS ARE DISTRIBUTED. AND I CAUGHT THAT- THERE'S 11% AND THEN THERE'S ALSO 4% AND I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT- WHY IS THAT AMOUNT OR THAT PERCENTAGE DIFFERENT FOR- AND ENTITIES ANDNOT A WISE AND IT EVENLY DISTRIBUTED- IT'S MORE I GUESS FOR ME TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE WAY THAT SEE A SPEECH HE WORKS BUT IF YOU. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE AN ANSWER TO THAT. HI THERE THE SIMPLE ANSWER IS THAT THE ALLOCATION OF DOG IS OUTLINED IN THE CODE- AND IT ALSO LOSE OF A LONGSTANDING ALLOCATION AS IT RELATES WE'RE TALKING ABOUT- THE- BEFORE PERCENT- TO- NATIVE- YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA OF INDIAN ORGANIZATIONS THAT ALSO INCLUDES OPIATES- THEY GET A BASE LEVEL FUNDING AS WELL- IT IS A BIT OF A COMPLEX FORMULA. FORMULATION THAT WE CAN PROVIDE TO SENATOR- IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT BUT IT IS. OUTLINED AS A AS A CODE SPECIFIC. WAYS IN WHICH THE THESE DOLLARS ARE GOING TO BE PROVIDED TO C. A. S. AND THE OTHER AGENCIES THAT TO ADMINISTER C. S. B. G. HERE IN CALIFORNIA. GREAT AND JUST A COUPLE MORE FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS TO THAT ONE- WHEN WAS THAT CODE LAST REVISITED- THAT. THAT ALLOCATES THESE PERCENTAGES STE THAT'S MY FIRST QUESTION AND THE SECOND QUESTION. IS WHAT IS. 11% AND 4% WHAT ARE THESE PERCENTAGES TRANSLATE WHEN IT. COMES TO ACTUAL DOLLARS. I DON'T KNOW WHEN THE CODE WAS READ. AND I CAN PULL THAT NUMBER HAVE IT TO YOU HERE IN A IN A MATTER OF SECONDS I DON'T HAVE THAT AT MY FINGERTIPS RIGHT NOW AS FAR AS THE- SPECIFIC ALLOCATIONS FOR TWENTY TWENTY. GOING FORWARD IN THE IN THE PLAN. AND THEN I HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION IN REGARDS TO THE DIFFERENCE THE FOR ELIGIBLE ENTITIES- IS THAT ALSO SOMETHING THAT IS- DETERMINE AND CODE- I MEAN THIS OR WAIT TOO EXPANDED THE ELIGIBLE ENTITIES- UNDER- HERE IN CALIFORNIA I MEAN I KNOW WE HAVE FIFTY TO SEE AS FOR MS F. W.'S THREE AND EIGHT EYES AND FIVE L. P. A.'S- BUT- I. JUST YOU KNOW I KNOW THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT NEED IS WHAT WHAT'S THE CRITERIA OR ELIGIBILITY TO. BE ABLE TO COME TO BECOME ONE OF THE AN- ENTITY UNDER ABOUT ONE OF THE FOUR. AGAIN THOSE ARE ESTABLISHED UNDER FEDERAL AND STATE LAW AND THE ENTITIES THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE A CALIFORNIA ARE GRANDFATHERED IN- AS FAR AS- THEY'RE THE THEY'RE JUST LOCKED IN HERE IN CALIFORNIA- THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE A PROCESS TO DETERMINE THAT D. DESIGNATION- THAT GOES THROUGH A SERIES OF. OF STEPS THAT AGAIN IS OUTLINED IN STATE CO TO- REMOVE A SINGLE ENTITY AND REPLACE IT WITH ANOTHER AT THIS STAGE WE ARE NOT ADDING ADDITIONAL OR MORE WILL WE GET THE DISMAL- ENTITIES BECAUSE ALL REGIONS OF CALIFORNIANS ARE COVERED- BASED ON OUR CURRENT- SPREAD ISSUES B. G. AGENCIES. SO JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT I UNDERSTOOD IT CLEARLY IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S THAT'S- PLACED INTO STATE AND FEDERAL LAW ALSO IS IT THAT THE STATE JUST KIND OF- GOES WITH WHAT WHAT FEDERAL LAW IS ASKING FOR AND WE ABIDE BY IT OR- I GUESS I NEED A LITTLE BIT MORE CLARIFICATION ON THAT. HOW IT WAS MORE ABOUT AS C. S. B. G. WAS IT IS AND REGIONALLY ADMINISTERED HERE AT THE STATE- ITS LONGSTANDING- A CODE SECTION AS IT RELATES TO WHO IS AND WHO IS NOT A C. S. B. G. GRANDFATHER AGENCY. AND IT GOES BACK TO- THE EARLY SIXTIES AND THEN THE CHANGES THAT HAVE FEDERAL CODE- UNDER THE C. S. B. G. ACT. AND WHO WILL BE IT WILL NOT BE CONSIDERS HIS PROJECTIONS IN CALIFORNIA SO IT ISN'T SOMETHING THAT- TO MY MIND I DON'T KNOW IF IT'D BEEN LOOKED AT- EIGHTY RECENT. TIME BUT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT. WE CAN DEFINITELY RESEARCH AND GET BACK TO YOU ABOUT. THANK YOU- I ALSO WANTED TO ASK IS CALIFORNIA MAXIMIZING THE FEDERAL DOLLARS THAT WE RECEIVE- TO SEE S. B. G. IS- OPPORTUNITY DUE TO IMPROVING GETTING ADDITIONAL DOLLARS. I BELIEVE I WOULD LIKE TO BELIEVE THAT WE ARE MAXIMIZING THE DOLLARS THAT THE EVEN IF WE COULD ASK FOR ADDITIONAL DOLLARS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OR OR THE ACTUAL EXPENDITURE OF DOLLARS ARE WE MAXIMIZING THAT. THAT'S MORE OF A GENERAL QUESTION DID DID FROM YOUR AND IF THERE'S IF YOU BELIEVE BUT MAYBE WE COULD- EXPAND THOSE DOLLARS- RIGHT. I THINK THAT- WELL FIRST TO MY HOME THE QUESTION WAS- WE THAT CALIFORNIA DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO EXPAND ON THE FEDERAL DOLLARS THOSE ARE ALLOCATED BASED ON- THE- US CENSUS DATA TRACKING INFORMATION THAT THAT YOU. WERE EXIST THE FEDERAL LEVEL SO THOSE ALLEGATIONS ARE LOCKED IN BY THE FEDS. AS FAR AS- ARE WE- ADMINISTERING THE DOLLARS IN THE BEST WAY POSSIBLE TO LOCAL LEVEL- I WOULD LIKE TO BELIEVE WE ARE I THINK WE ARE. I THINK THAT THE REPORTING THAT COMES UP FOR MARK RCCG AGENCY SHOWS A SIGNIFICANT EIGHT SUPPORT SERVICES AND OUTCOMES- TO LOW INCOME CALIFORNIA'S THROUGHOUT THE STATE I WOULD INVITE- MISTER KNIGHT. AND MR DEVICE POTENTIALLY TO SHARE. ANY PERSONAL EXPERIENCES OR OR THOUGHTS ON THAT AS WELL IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO HEAR FROM THEM- BUT FROM THE DEPARTMENT'S POINT OF VIEW WE BELIEVE THAT THE BOTTOM UP PROGRAM- CCG IS SERVING. WELCOME CALIFORNIANS- THE BEST WAY POSSIBLE AS THEY ARE BROKEN OUT BY AGENCY AND BY THEIR LOCAL. NEEDS AND THEIR LOCAL NEEDS ASSESSMENTS. WHAT ANY OTHER OF THE SPEAKERS LIKE TO ADD TO THAT. I WILL JUST MENTION A DAVID NIGHT OF ACCOUNTABLE WE HAVE A REQUESTED ADDITIONAL- FIFTY FIVE MILLION UP FROM- THE FEDERAL OCS THIS YEAR- IS IN THE BUDGET HAS BEEN ORIGINALLY PUT IN ABOUT ONE TO COMMITTEE SO. THERE IS A HOPE TO EXPAND THE C. S. B. G. RECORDS THAT IS SET BY THE FANS. AND YOU KNOW THE MAJORITY THE FLEXIBILITY DOES COME IN IN THE DISCRETIONARY FUNDING OF THE STATE YOU KNOW FOR THE ABILITY TO CREATE A BE CREATIVE AS A STATEWIDE. WELL THE MAJORITY OF THE REST OF THE 90% OF IT IS REALLY BASED ON THAT AGENCY LEVEL SO I THINK GERMAN WOULD LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THE- YEAH. THE ONE POINT I WOULD ADD TO IS IT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THE FUNDING IS. DERIVED BASED ON POPULATIONS AND A FORMULA DRIVE FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOWN TO THE STATE AND- DOWN TO OUR LOCAL AGENCIES. I WOULD I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT THAT AS FAR AS MAXIMIZING THE WORD MAXIMIZING THE FUNDING I WOULD SAY. THE FLEXIBILITY OF C. S. B. G. ALLOWS US TO MAXIMIZE WHATEVER AMOUNT THE FUNDING WE GET LOCALLY. WE'RE ABLE TO LEVERAGE IT SO WE SPREAD OUR MONEY. IN KERN COUNTY OUT AMONGST MANY PROGRAMS- WHETHER IT BE MY GIRL TURNER PAYMENT PROGRAM. OR VITA PROGRAM- DIFFERENT PROGRAMS TO USE CENTERS ARE FOOD BANKS WE SPREAD THAT OUT LEVERAGE AGAINST MANY OTHER STATE AND FEDERAL PROGRAMS. AND BUILD THE PROGRAMS THAT WERE ABLE TO OPERATE. SO WE GET MAXIMUM LEVERAGE OUT OF THE MONEY WE GET FROM C. S. B. G. WE CAN MAXIMIZE THAT- VERY STRONGLY BECAUSE OF THE ABILITY TO LEVERAGE AND MOVE THE MONEY AROUND HOW WE SEE FIT LOCALLY. THANK YOU AND- I DON'T HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS BUT I WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A COMMODORE AT KNOB SURVATION THAT I MADE. SEVERAL MONTHS AGO I WAS ACTUALLY REVIEWING THE STATE PLAN. THE MOST RECENT ONE THAT WAS AVAILABLE ON THE INTERNET AND- WHAT WAY LONG BEFORE THIS THIS HEARING AND- ALSO WHEN AND KIND OF COME PAIRED SOME OF THE PREVIOUS STATE PLANS THAT WERE- ALSO AVAILABLE ONLINE AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THERE'S VERY- MINIMAL. CHANGE I THINK THAT THERE'S A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU TO MAXIMIZE PERHAPS I DON'T KNOW MAYBE MAXIMIZES NOT THE RIGHT WORD BUT- MAYBE THERE'S MORE OPPORTUNITIES AND THEY'RE FREE- YOU KNOW FULLY AND THOROUGHLY- REVIEW THAT THAT STATE PLAN IT'S JUST AN OBSERVATION THAT I MADE THAT I WANT TO PUT ON THE RECORD TODAY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS HELD. OKAY I'D LIKE TO WELCOME OUR SECOND PANEL TO BEGIN THEIR PRESENTATION- WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM SOME OF THE REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE FUNDED AGENCIES- DO WE HAVE OVERHEAD THE LAVA.

AS WELL AS A TO OTHER TYPES OF AGENCIES- I CAN REPORT TO THIS COMMITTEE THAT CBO SEE- WE ARE NOT ONLY THE COMMUNITY ACTION AGENCY AND STANISLAUS COUNTY BUT WE ARE ALSO FUNDED BY C. S. B. G. TO PROVIDE MIGRANT SEASONAL FARMWORKERS SERVICES IN STANISLAUS MERCED AND MADERA SO WE KIND OF CHECK TO OF THOSE BOXES. SORRY THIS HAS BEEN AROUND FOR OVER FORTY TWO YEARS AND AS I MENTIONED WE'RE IN THE CENTRAL SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY ONE OF THE OF COURSE COMMUNITIES AND ALL OF CALIFORNIA SO THE CSPD FUNDING THAT WE DO RECEIVE FROM CST IS VERY BENEFICIAL TO OUR COMMUNITIES AND NOT ONLY- PROVIDING SERVICES. TO BREAK THE CYCLE OF POVERTY BUT ALSO TO BRING FAMILIES AND OUR COMMUNITIES CLOSER TO SELF SUFFICIENCY. SOME OF THE AREAS OF OUR FOCUS. WITH THE CSPD FUNDS. TEND TO REVOLVE AROUND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT EMPLOYMENT TRAINING PROGRAMS REMEDIATION. COURSES LIKE ESL AND GED PREPARATION. AS WELL AS HUMAN SERVICES- SUCH AS- RENTAL ASSISTANCE FOOD VOUCHERS UTILITY ASSISTANCE FOOD DISTRIBUTION ETCETERA ETCETERA. DURING THE LAST EIGHTEEN MONTHS- TO THE PANDEMIC- THERE IS ONE PARTICULAR AVENUE OF PERFORMANCE BUT CBO SEEING HAS USED IT SINCE MAJI FUNDS THAT I LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT FOR YOU TODAY. AND THAT IS A COLLABORATION BETWEEN CST CAL PALPA CENTRAL VALLEY OPPORTUNITY CENTER ANOTHER NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION CALIFORNIA CALLED SUPPLIED INC COLLABORATION BETWEEN THE FOUR ENTITIES BUT I MENTIONED- WE WERE ABLE TO DISTRIBUTE UNNECESSARY TP ITEMS. TO COMMUNITY ACTION AGENCIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA- OUR ROLE IN THAT TERRIBLE- PARTNERSHIP. WAS HELPING SUPPLY BANK DISTRIBUTE. THAT PPE ITEMS. ARTICULATED ACTUALLY DISEASE WITH THE USE OF OUR TRUCK SCHOOL THAT WE OPERATE- WITH THE HELP OF C. S. B. G. FUNDS. SO OUR TRACKING STUDENTS WHO WERE LEARNING REAL WORLD- PROFESSIONAL SKILLS AND ALSO HELPING THE COMMUNITIES AT THE SAME TIME. BY OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH SUPPLY BANK- ENTAILED OF CBSE PICKING UP BALLOTS OF PP FROM THEIR WAREHOUSE. AND DISTRIBUTING IT THROUGHOUT THE CENTRAL VALLEY AS WELL AS THE MOTHER LOAD UP IN THE FOOTHILLS.

THROUGHOUT THE CALIFORNIA. IN THE- MIGRANTS IN FARMWORKERS WERE DEEMED AS- LAST YEAR HELLO IN MY OPINION THEY'VE BEEN ESSENTIAL FROM. DAY ONE FROM THE EXISTENCE OF THE FARM WORKER- HAVING COME FROM A FARM WORKER BACKGROUND- WHAT WITH MY PARENTS AND OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS- THIS PARTICULAR POPULATION IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME AND IS VERY POOR TO CENTRAL VALLEY OPPORTUNITY CENTER. AND WITH THE USE OF THIS YEAR'S BUDGET FUNDS- YOUR MARK FOR MYERS IS A FORMER- WE'RE ABLE TO SUPPORT THEM IN THE NEEDS- AS I MENTIONED EARLIER TO BECOME SELF SUFFICIENT- BACK TO THE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PIPING SO- WE'RE REAL WORLD EXPERIENCE FOR STUDENTS- NECESSARY. PPE ITEMS DELIVERED TO ESSENTIAL WORKERS- BY ASCENTIAL WORKERS- THE FLEXIBILITY OF CSPD. IS WHAT ALLOWED THAT- LASTLY I WOULD LIKE TO THANK- FOR OTHER OPENNESS TO THAT TYPE OF PARTNERSHIP- I THINK THE- THE DATA SPEAKS FOR ITSELF AND THEN THE REAL WORK EXPERIENCE FOR OUR STUDENTS HAS BEEN EXTREMELY BENEFICIAL.

THE WORK YOU DO IN THE CAPITAL OF THE SUPPORT TO PURSUE A PROVIDE THE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO THOSE MOST IN NEED. WE APPRECIATE YOUR TIME DEDICATION TO EVERYTHING IS B. G. PROGRAM THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS AN S. AND NEXT WE HAVE A SANDRA VALDEZ THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR LOS ANGELES NATIVE AMERICAN INDIAN COMMISSION. HI GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR CALDERON CARE HER TADO VICE CHAIR DAVIES THANKS JERRY JONES AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS YOU TODAY AND SURE ABOUT HOW THE COMMUNITY SERVICES BLOCK GRANT NATIVE AMERICANS SET ASIDE FUNDS SUPPORT LOS ANGELES COUNTY'S AMERICAN INDIAN ALASKAN NATIVE COMMUNITIES. MY NAME IS ALEXANDER VALDEZ AND TODAY I'M CALLING IN FROM THE ANCESTRAL AND UNCEDED TERRITORY OF THE TONGA QUICHE TO TANYA AND SHE MATCH PEOPLE. WHAT IS NOW KNOWN TODAY AS LOS ANGELES COUNTY. I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE LOS ANGELES CITY COUNTY NATIVE AMERICAN INDIAN COMMISSION AND THE COMMISSION SELF GOVERNANCE BOARD. THE COMMISSION IS A JOINT CITY OF LA COUNTY OF LA ADVISORY COMMISSION THAT WAS ESTABLISHED FORTY FIVE YEARS AGO TO SUPPORT ELOISE AMERICAN INDIAN AND ALASKA NATIVE COMMUNITY. THE LARGEST OF ANY COUNTY IN THE COUNTRY. WHILE WE ARE THE LARGEST NATIVE COMMUNITY IN THE COUNTRY MUCH OF THE WORK OF THE COMMISSION IS CENTERED AROUND COMBATING SYSTEMIC AND STRUCTURAL RASCHER OF NATIVE PEOPLE HISTORIES AND CULTURE. IN ORDER TO ENSURE WE ARE VISIBLE AS A POPULATION AND OUR NEEDS AND CONCERNS ARE ADDRESSED. ORDING TO RESEARCH RECENT RESEARCH BY ELIMINATED ENCOUNTER RECEIVE INFORMATION IF PEOPLE'S. 87% OF STATE HISTORY SANDERS DO NOT MENTION IN AMERICAN HISTORY AFTER NINETEEN HUNDRED. AND CLOSE TO A QUARTER OF ALL STATES MAKE NO MENTION OF NATIVE AMERICANS AND THEIR K. THROUGH TWELVE CURRICULUM AT ALL. THIS CONTRIBUTES TO MAINSTREAM AMERICA BELIEVING THAT NATIVE AMERICANS ARE PASTOR DWINDLING POPULATION. A RACING OUR HISTORY LEADS TO AN ERASURE OF OUR CURRENT REALITIES AND NEEDS. THIS IS BECAUSE IT CAUSES A LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OF THE TRAUMA THIS HISTORY IS BECAUSE AND THE PERVASIVE SOCIOECONOMIC. AND HEALTH DISPARITIES BORN OUT OF THAT TRAUMA. IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY NATIVE PEOPLE ARE THREE POINT FOUR TIMES MORE LIKELY THAN NON HISPANIC WHITES TO LIVE IN HOUSEHOLDS WITH AN INCOME BELOW THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. WITH APPROXIMATELY ONE IN THREE URBAN NATIVE CHILDREN LIVING IN HOUSEHOLDS WITH INCOME BELOW THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. NATIVE PEOPLE IN L. A. COUNTY ARE FIVE POINT FIVE TIMES MORE LIKELY TO EXPERIENCE HOMELESSNESS. ACCORDING TO THEIR SHARE OF THEIR POPULATION MAKING NATIVE PEOPLE THE RACIAL ETHNIC GROUP MOST DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED BY HOMELESSNESS AND L. A. COUNTY. COMPARED TO THE GENERAL POPULATION AMERICAN INDIANS ALASKA NATIVE IN L. A. COUNTY- ALSO DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED BY ADDICTION OR FORECLOSURE. UNINHABITABLE LIVING ONDITIONS AND MEDICAL DISABILITY AS REASONS FOR HOMELESSNESS. AND IT IS ESTIMATED THAT OVER 90% OF OUR IN HOUSE AMERICAN INDIANS AND ALASKA NATIVES IN L. A. COUNTY ARE UNSHELTERED. I COULD GO ON ABOUT THE OTHER ALARMING AND HEARTBREAKING STATISTICS THAT IMPACT NATIVE PEOPLE IN L. A. COUNTY. HOWEVER I WANT TO TAKE THE REST OF MY TIME TODAY TO SURE ABOUT HOW THE C. S. B. G. NATIVE AMERICANS OUTSIDE FUNDS ARE BEING UTILIZED BY OUR INCREDIBLE SUB RECIPIENT AGENCIES. TO SUPPORTER NATIVE COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND ADDRESS THESE ISSUES. THE COMMISSION GOVERNANCE BOARD HAS BEEN ADMINISTERING COMMUNITY SERVICE BLOCK GRANTNATIVE AMERICANS THAT ASIDE FUNDS SINCE THE EARLY NINETEEN NINETIES. FOR NEARLY THIRTY YEARS THESE FUNDS HAVE PROVIDED CRITICAL SERVICES TO LOS ANGELES IS AMERICAN INDIAN ALASKAN NATIVE COMMUNITIES. AS YOU MAY OR MAY NOT KNOW. THERE ARE NO FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED TRIBES IN WHAT IS NOW KNOWN AS LOS ANGELES COUNTY. AS A RESULT OF NOT HAVING FEDERAL RECOGNITION THE LOCAL TRIBES OF L. A. COUNTY ARE AN ELIGIBLE FOR MANY OF THE FUNDS DEDICATED AND DIRECTED AT TRACKS. ADDITIONALLY THERE ARE VERY FEW DOLLARS- THAT COME INTO URBAN AREAS LIKE LOS ANGELES COUNTY. FOR URBAN NATIVE PEOPLE. AS SUCH THE CSP JEANETTE AMERICANS OUTSIDE FUNDS OR SOME OF THE ONLY DEDICATED DOLLARS TARGETED L. A. COUNTY URBAN AMERICAN INDIAN ALASKAN NATIVE POPULATION. TODAY THESE FUNDS ALLOW COMMUNITY MEMBERS LIVING IN POVERTY TO OBTAIN MUCH NEEDED SERVICES AND CULTURALLY SUPPORTIVE SETTINGS. CURRENTLY WE FUNDS THREE SEPARATE CIVILIAN AGENCIES ALL THREE AGENCIES ARE TRUSTED AMERICAN EIGHT AMERICAN INDIAN ALASKAN NATIVE SERVING ORGANIZATIONS. WHO SERVICE AREAS ARE THE ENTIRE COUNTY OF LA. THE NATIVE COMMUNITY IN L. A. COUNTY IS NON GEOGRAPHICALLY CONCENTRATED HOWEVER WE SEE TAT THAT OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS WILL TRAVEL ACROSS THE COUNTY I COUNTY LARGER THAN DELAWARE TO SEEK SERVICES AT A TRUSTED NATIVE SERVING ORGANIZATION. TODAY OUR THREE SUB RECIPIENT AGENCIES UTILIZE ESG FUNDING TO PROVIDE A VARIETY OF SERVICES TO OUR INCOME ELIGIBLE COMMUNITY MEMBERS. INCLUDING CONGREGATE MEALS TO ELDERS AS WELL AS OTHER NUTRITIONAL SERVICES. RENTAL ASSISTANCE UTILITY ASSISTANCE SCHOOL SUPPLIES AND EMERGENCY CLOTHING FOR STUDENTS AS WELL AS TRANSPORTATION SERVICES. ALL OF THESE SERVICES ARE DELIVERED AND CULTURALLY SUPPORTIVE SETTINGS. TO OCCURRENCE OF RECIPIENT AGENCIES ALSO ADMINISTER COMMUNITY SERVICE BLOCK GRANT CARE SPENDING TO SPECIFICALLY SUPPORT OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND ACTED BY CODE NINETEEN. SHARES THE PANDEMIC OUR COMMUNITY EXPERIENCE DISPROPORTIONATE RATES OF HOMELESSNESS HOUSING INSECURITY AND UNEMPLOYMENT BUT THESE FUNDS HAVE BEEN CRITICAL AND ALLOWING US TO SUPPORT OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS DURING THIS UNPRECEDENTED TIMES. ADDITIONALLY BECAUSE OF THE TEMPORARY INCREASED INCOME ELIGIBILITY FOR THESE FUNDS WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SERVE A GREATER PORTION OF OUR COMMUNITY WHO ARE IN NEED BUT NORMALLY NOT ELIGIBLE FOR C. S. B. G. SERVICES. RECENTLY ONE OF OUR SERVERS HAVE BEEN AGENCIES WITH ZERO WAS ABLE TO UTILIZE THE S. B. G. FUNDING TO ASSIST A COMMUNITY MEMBER AND HER PLANE SECURE WHAT COULD POSSIBLY. BE LIFE ON HOUSING STABILITY. THIS PARTICULAR CLIENT WAS IN NEED OF ASSISTANCE WITH MOVING COSTS PER UNIT SHE HAD FOUND THAT WOULD TAKE HER SECTION EIGHT VOUCHER. THIS IS AN ACHIEVEMENT IN OF ITSELF AS SHE LIKELY HAD TO BE PLACED ON A SECTIN EIGHT WAITLIST. THROUGH A LOTTERY THEN WAIT FOR ON THAT LIST FOR SIX TO TEN YEARS AND THEN ON TOP OF THAT FIND A LANDLORD WILLING TO TAKE ABOUT YOUR AND THE INCREDIBLY COMPETITIVE. RENTAL MARKET THAT IS LOS ANGELES COUNTY. I AM WHEN IT SEEMS SHE HAD MADE IT THROUGH ALL POSSIBLE BARRIERS. I WAS ABLE TO AFFORD RENT. SHE COULD NOT MANAGE A SECURITY POP DEPOSIT WHICH WAS FOUR TIMES FOR MONTHLY RESPONSIBILITY. ARE SUB RECIPIENT AGENCY WAS ABLE TO QUICKLY WORK WITH HER LANDLORD AND PROVIDE ASSISTANCE WITH MOVING COSTS. TODAY HER AND HER FAMILY HAVE STABLE AND SECURE HOUSING. AND LIKELY WILL FOR MANY MANY YEARS TO COME. IN ADDITION TO AN EXAMPLE OF A SERVICE ACCESS. I ALSO WANTED TO SHARE ABOUT HOW THE ABILITY TO LEVERAGE THE S. B. G. FUNDING HAS LED TO A HUGE WIN FOR US THIS PAST WEEK. THAT ALMOST CERTAINLY ALLOW US TO SERVICE MORE OF OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS IMPACTED BY HOMELESSNESS AND HOUSING INSECURITY AND THIS CURRENT FISCAL YEAR. IN NOVEMBER TWENTY TWENTY MEASURE J. WAS APPROVED-BY L. A. COUNTY VOTERS. TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF SYSTEMIC RACISM BY PROVIDING FUNDING. FOR ALTERNATIVES TO INCARCERATION AND DIRECT COMMUNITY INVESTMENTS. MEASURE J.

BUT THIS VIDEO THAT I'LL BE SHARING WITH YOU ALL I WAS ABLE TO HELP PRODUCE IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE NETWORK OF LA BASED AMERICAN INDIANS. AND THEY AMERICAN INDIAN ALASKAN NATIVE SERVING ORGANIZATIONS- WHILE NO CSU DOLLARS WERE SPENT DIRECTLY ON THIS PROJECT MY TIME WORKING ON THIS PROJECT WAS PARTIALLY SUPPORTED BY C. S. B. G. AND IS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF HOW INCREDIBLE THE ABILITY TO LEVERAGE THE S. B. G. FUNDING IS. THIS PSA WAS DEVELOPED IN THE SUMMER OF TWENTY TWENTY IT WASSHARED ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND THEN RE SHARED THROUGHOUT THIS COUNTRY. ADDITIONALLY WE ARE ALSO ABLE TO SECURED SECURED EARNED MEDIA PLACEMENT ON KABC SEVEN LA THE NETWORK GRANITE DURING PRIME TIMES FOR MONTHS. FOR MONTHS IN LATE SUMMER AND EARLY FALL TWENTY TWENTY IT WAS TRULY A LABOR OF LOVE AND REMINDED OUR COMMUNITY TO COMMIT TO SAY PRACTICES DURING THIS PANDEMIC. FOR ANCESTORS.

IS DECADES AHEAD OF ITS TIME IN TERMS OF UNDERSTANDING HOW EFFECTIVE CHANGES DRIVEN BY COMMUNITY.

CSPD HAS UNDERSTANDING SINCE ITS INCEPTION. FRAWLEY COUNTIES NATIVE COMMUNITIES THAT HAS PROVEN TO BE ONE OF THE BEST THINGS ABOUT THIS PROGRAM.
