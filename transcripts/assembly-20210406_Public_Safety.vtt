INDICATED DURING THEIR-

01:22:58.807 --> 01:23:00.241
EXHAUSTIVE INVESTIGATION INTO

01:23:00.308 --> 01:23:02.477
THESE ISSUES. THAT THERE IS A

01:23:20.929 --> 01:23:24.099
CONCERN IS THAT MERE MEMBERSHIP

01:23:24.165 --> 01:23:26.101
IS GROUNDS FOR NOT BEING HIRED.

01:23:26.167 --> 01:23:27.702
SOMETHING COULD HAVE HAPPENED

01:23:27.769 --> 01:23:29.871
SIX YEARS EARLIER. FRANKLY

01:23:29.938 --> 01:23:31.806
YOU'RE A DIFFERENT PERSON

FOUR. BUT EVEN BEYOND THAT THE

01:23:35.810 --> 01:23:38.113
IDEA OF USING MEMBERSHIP. IS

01:23:38.179 --> 01:23:41.049
JUST REPORTING THAT. THIS

01:23:41.116 --> 01:23:44.719

01:24:29.497 --> 01:24:29.964
OF THE BILL JUST DRIVES ME

01:24:30.031 --> 01:24:33.635
CRAZY. SO IF YOU'RE WILLING TO

TAKE OUT THE MEMBERSHIP CARDS.

01:24:35.603 --> 01:24:38.673
AND JUST GO ON HOW PEOPLE ACT.

01:24:38.740 --> 01:24:40.208
THEN I'M OKAY I THINK THAT'S

01:24:40.275 --> 01:24:41.409
PRETTY MUCH THE POSITION OF THE

01:24:41.476 --> 01:24:44.312
OPPOSITION OF MR LANKY BUT WHEN

01:24:44.379 --> 01:24:46.815

01:24:50.218 --> 01:24:51.719
OF THE APPRECIATE THE FEEDBACK

01:24:51.786 --> 01:24:53.822
WE ARE WORKING WITH- GROUPS

01:24:53.888 --> 01:24:55.056
INCLUDING DELIBERATE PLEASE

01:24:55.123 --> 01:24:56.224
TACKLE IT WILL BE MEETING WITH

01:24:56.291 --> 01:24:57.592
THEM BECAUSE THEY DO HAVE SOME.

01:24:57.659 --> 01:24:58.760
ADDITIONAL CONCERNS THAT WE'RE

01:24:58.827 --> 01:24:59.794
COMMITTED TO THESE TRYING TO

01:24:59.861 --> 01:25:02.130
WORK ON I WILL SAY THAT LOOK

01:25:02.197 --> 01:25:05.333
YOU KNOW THIS IS FOCUSED ON-

01:25:05.400 --> 01:25:07.402
GROUPS- THAT ACTUALLY

01:25:07.469 --> 01:25:08.770
THREATENED PHYSICAL VIOLENCE

01:25:08.837 --> 01:25:10.338
LIKE I SAID THE FBI HAS BEEN

01:25:10.405 --> 01:25:13.475
ABLE TO. IDENTIFY GROUPS- THAT

01:25:13.541 --> 01:25:15.310
INCLUDES IT EXTREMIST GROUPS

01:25:15.376 --> 01:25:17.712
THIS IS NOT. COMPLETELY YOU

01:25:17.779 --> 01:25:21.082
KNOW JUST A- A SUBJECTIVE WHAT

01:25:21.149 --> 01:25:22.350
TYPE OF MEASUREMENT AND I THINK

01:25:22.417 --> 01:25:23.751
THAT THERE ARE. YOU KNOW

01:25:23.818 --> 01:25:27.055
SOMEONE- IS A MEMBER OF THE KKK

01:25:27.121 --> 01:25:28.656
I THINK THAT'S A PROBLEM IF

01:25:28.723 --> 01:25:29.123
THEY WANT TO BE A LAW

01:25:29.190 --> 01:25:30.925
ENFORCEMENT FRANKLY- AND AGAIN

01:25:30.992 --> 01:25:32.427
THAT THERE'S A REASON WHY WE

01:25:32.494 --> 01:25:34.162
ALSO GOT RID OF THE- DEBT THE%

01:25:34.229 --> 01:25:36.764
TIMELESSNESS OF IT. AND MADE

01:25:36.831 --> 01:25:37.365
SEVEN YEARS AND I THINK THAT

01:25:37.432 --> 01:25:39.033
THAT AT LEAST GIVES A PERIOD OF

01:25:39.100 --> 01:25:40.902
TIME WHERE. YOU KNOW THERE'S

01:25:40.969 --> 01:25:42.737
SOME SEPARATION FROM ANY

01:25:42.804 --> 01:25:45.240
AFFILIATION- UP BECAUSE TO YOUR

01:25:45.306 --> 01:25:46.975
POINT I THINK THAT BEFORE THAT

01:25:47.041 --> 01:25:48.676
IN THE ORIGINAL WRITING OF THE

01:25:48.743 --> 01:25:49.511
BILL DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING ON

01:25:49.577 --> 01:25:51.179
THE TIMELINESS OF IT SO COULD

01:25:51.246 --> 01:25:52.714
HAVE BEEN TWENTY YEARS EARLIER.

01:25:52.780 --> 01:25:54.716
OR TEN FIFTEEN TWENTY YEARS

01:25:54.782 --> 01:25:57.218
EARLIER EVERYTHING JUST LIKE

01:25:57.285 --> 01:25:59.754
ALL THIS LIKE MANY OF US WORK-

01:25:59.821 --> 01:26:00.688
AND BELIEVE IN REDEMPTION FOR

01:26:00.755 --> 01:26:02.390
THOSE THAT. GET CAUGHT UP IN

01:26:02.457 --> 01:26:03.057
THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM

01:26:03.124 --> 01:26:04.492
SOME AT LEAST ONCE GOING TO LAW

01:26:04.559 --> 01:26:05.593
ENFORCEMENT THEY HAVE THE RIGHT

01:26:05.660 --> 01:26:06.895
FOR THAT REDUCTION AS WELL AS

01:26:06.961 --> 01:26:08.263
US MNEY BUT THAT TIME I AM

01:26:08.329 --> 01:26:10.231
WILLING TO CONCEDE THAT YOU CAN

01:26:10.298 --> 01:26:15.770
DETERMINE WHAT I HATE GROUP IS.

01:26:15.837 --> 01:26:16.304
I THINK MERE MEMBERSHIP.

01:26:16.371 --> 01:26:17.872
DISQUALIFY YOU. ROOMS FOR

01:26:17.939 --> 01:26:19.007
REASON FOR NOT BEING HIRED. IS

01:26:19.073 --> 01:26:21.743
JUST. APPROPRIATE WHAT WAS YOUR-

01:26:21.809 --> 01:26:23.411
OKAY AND THEN ITS GROUNDS AND

01:26:23.478 --> 01:26:26.814
SO- IF THE LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:26:26.881 --> 01:26:28.683
AGENCY DOING THE HIRING. FEELS

EARLIER. BUT THOSE ARE NOT

01:26:33.955 --> 01:26:35.256
GROUNDS FOR TERMINATION OF FOR

01:26:35.323 --> 01:26:36.524
NOT HIRING SOMEONE. THAT'S

01:26:36.591 --> 01:26:38.560
UNDER DISCUSSION AS WELL. I

THIRTY EIGHT IS THE BAIL BONDS

01:41:30.784 --> 01:41:33.253
INDUSTRY. THE BAIL INDUSTRY HAS

01:41:33.320 --> 01:41:34.721
ADVOCATED FOR A STATEWIDE BAIL

01:41:34.788 --> 01:41:37.324
SCHEDULE BECAUSE LOWER AVAIL

01:41:37.391 --> 01:41:38.225
AMOUNTS ARE ACTUALLY IN THEIR

01:41:38.292 --> 01:41:40.260
FAVOR. DUE TO CALIFORNIA'S

01:41:40.327 --> 01:41:41.995
EXTREMELY HIGH BAIL AMOUNTS

01:41:42.062 --> 01:41:43.597
BAIL BOND COMPANIES HAVE BEEN

01:41:43.664 --> 01:41:44.932
FORCED TO SHIFT THEIR ENTIRE

01:41:44.998 --> 01:41:46.567
BUSINESS MODEL AND NOW

01:41:46.633 --> 01:41:48.635
ROUTINELY OFFER CREDIT BAIL

01:41:48.702 --> 01:41:50.103
BECAUSE PEOPLE CANNOT AFFORD TO

01:41:50.170 --> 01:41:52.172
PAY THE 10% PREMIUM VIA THE

01:41:52.239 --> 01:41:54.074
BAIL BONDS INDUSTRY CHARGES UP

01:41:54.141 --> 01:41:56.276
FRONT. THEREFORE THE BAIL BOND

01:41:56.343 --> 01:41:58.178
INDUSTRY FREQUENTLY FINANCES

01:41:58.245 --> 01:41:59.680
THEIR BAIL BOND AGREEMENT

01:41:59.746 --> 01:42:01.415
BREAKING UP THE DEBT AND THE

01:42:01.482 --> 01:42:03.217
PAYMENTS TO BE MADE OVER TIME.

01:42:03.283 --> 01:42:04.117
THIS IS PUT THEM IN THE

01:42:04.184 --> 01:42:05.319
POSITION OF BECOMING DEBT

01:42:05.385 --> 01:42:07.321
COLLECTION AGENCIES AND THEY

01:42:07.387 --> 01:42:08.856
OFTEN HAVE DIFFICULTY FULLY

01:42:08.922 --> 01:42:10.357
COLLECTING OUTSTANDING DEBT

01:42:10.424 --> 01:42:11.892
BECAUSE THE AMOUNTS ARE SO

01:42:11.959 --> 01:42:14.127
ASTRONOMICALLY HIGH. BUT PEOPLE

01:42:14.194 --> 01:42:15.596
DIFFERENTLY CANNOT AFFORD TO

01:42:15.662 --> 01:42:18.065
PAY THEM. SO IN THE INDUSTRY

01:42:18.131 --> 01:42:19.867
BACK IN A STATEWIDE BAIL

01:42:19.933 --> 01:42:21.335
SCHEDULE THAT ESTABLISHES

01:42:21.401 --> 01:42:22.936
SLIGHTLY LOWER BAIL AMOUNT

01:42:23.003 --> 01:42:24.738
MEANS MORE PEOPLE WILL BE ABLE

01:42:24.805 --> 01:42:26.240
TO POST BAIL. USINGTHEIR

01:42:26.306 --> 01:42:28.008
SERVICES THE INDUSTRY WILL

01:42:28.075 --> 01:42:29.443
SPEND LESS TIME COLLECTING

01:42:29.510 --> 01:42:31.578
OUTSTANDING DEBT AND THEREFORE

01:42:31.645 --> 01:42:32.913
THEY MAY EVEN EARN A HIGHER

01:42:32.980 --> 01:42:34.448
PROFIT IN THE END. THIS IS

01:42:34.515 --> 01:42:36.116
EXACTLY WHAT THE INDUSTRY WANTS

01:42:36.183 --> 01:42:38.285
TO SEE. AB THIRTY EIGHT

01:42:38.352 --> 01:42:39.319
THREATENS TO MORE DEEPLY

01:42:41.722 --> 01:42:43.757

01:46:32.886 --> 01:46:34.421
APPRECIATE HEARING THAT THE

01:46:34.488 --> 01:46:35.622
OTHER ISSUE WAS BROUGHT FORWARD

01:46:35.689 --> 01:46:38.725
BY- MR ARJUN IT'S A- LEGIT.

01:46:38.792 --> 01:46:40.861
CONCERN THE RECENT US SUPREME

01:46:40.927 --> 01:46:44.297
COURT DECISION- AND I. JUST

01:46:44.364 --> 01:46:45.265
ANT TO GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO

01:46:45.332 --> 01:46:48.401
TRY TO MITIGATE AND- EXPLAIN

01:46:48.468 --> 01:46:49.469
HOW IT'S STILL CONSISTENT WITH

01:46:49.536 --> 01:46:50.637
THAT COURT FINDING WHAT I

01:46:50.704 --> 01:46:51.471
BELIEVE THEY'RE A LITTLE BIT

01:46:51.538 --> 01:46:52.873
DISINGENUOUS BOTTLES ATTORNEYS

01:46:52.939 --> 01:46:54.374
WHAT HUMPHREY SAID IS THAT NO

01:46:54.441 --> 01:46:56.243
PERSON. SHOULD LOSE THE RIGHT

01:46:56.309 --> 01:46:57.811
TO LIBERTY SIMPLY BECAUSE THAT

01:46:57.878 --> 01:46:59.179
PERSON CANNOT AFFORD TO POST

01:46:59.246 --> 01:47:01.248
BAIL. IT DID NOT MAKE CAST BILL

01:47:01.314 --> 01:47:03.283
IN CONSTITUTIONAL JUST REAFFIRM

01:47:03.350 --> 01:47:04.785
THAT MUST BE FAIR THAT THE

01:47:04.851 --> 01:47:07.187
INABILITY TO POST BAIL ALONE.

01:47:07.254 --> 01:47:07.721
CANNOT BE THE SOLE FACTOR

01:47:07.788 --> 01:47:09.790
SETTING BILL. SB THIRTY

01:47:09.856 --> 01:47:10.824
ACTUALLY SUPPORTS HIS DECISION

01:47:10.891 --> 01:47:12.759
IN THIS LANGUAGE AND INTENT.

01:47:12.826 --> 01:47:14.461
THEY CAN VIRTUALLY LOWER BILL

01:47:14.528 --> 01:47:16.596
US BASED ACROSS THE STATE AND

01:47:16.663 --> 01:47:17.297
LARGELY PROHIBITS BILL

01:47:17.364 --> 01:47:19.266
STACKING. AND NO ONE WE TALKED

01:47:19.332 --> 01:47:20.634
ABOUT THE BILL STACKING AND

01:47:20.700 --> 01:47:22.335
WHAT IT DOES WHEN YOU'RE BOOKED

01:47:22.402 --> 01:47:23.837
FOR TWO OR MORE FENCES. BILL

01:47:23.904 --> 01:47:25.338
SHOULD BE SETTLED FOR THE

01:47:25.405 --> 01:47:26.873
CHARGE WITH THE HIGHEST AMOUNT

01:47:26.940 --> 01:47:29.042

PRIORS IT'S NOT THAT WAY RIGHT

01:47:36.049 --> 01:47:37.417
NOW. THIS BILL WOULD NOT

01:47:37.484 --> 01:47:38.118
PROHIBIT THE COURTS FROM

01:47:46.960 --> 01:47:49.296

BUT IT SHOULDN'T BE. A HUNDRED

01:48:12.419 --> 01:48:12.919
FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS MORE

01:48:12.986 --> 01:48:15.222
SOMEWHERE ELSE. THE ANOTHER

01:48:15.288 --> 01:48:16.356
COUNTY THAT THAT IT THAT IS

01:48:16.423 --> 01:48:18.725
ASININE THAT IS THAT WAY AND IT

01:48:18.792 --> 01:48:20.260
WILL CONTINUE TO BE THAT WAY

01:48:20.327 --> 01:48:21.328
WE'RE THIS POSITION BECAUSE OF

01:48:21.394 --> 01:48:23.296
JUDGES AND WE'RE THE START THAT

01:48:23.363 --> 01:48:24.731
YOU WANT TO GO BACK IN HISTORY

01:48:24.798 --> 01:48:26.666
THE START OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE.

01:48:26.733 --> 01:48:27.868
BECAUSE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WAS

01:48:27.934 --> 01:48:29.870
TAKEN OFF AND THEY STARTED

01:48:29.936 --> 01:48:31.071
INCREASING BILL FOR DIFFERENT

01:48:31.137 --> 01:48:32.672
THINGS THAT'S WHEN WE SAW THE

01:48:32.739 --> 01:48:33.707
BILL SCHEDULE INCREASED

01:48:33.773 --> 01:48:35.041
DRAMATICALLY BECAUSE OF

01:48:35.108 --> 01:48:36.910
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IT CAUGHT UP

01:48:36.977 --> 01:48:38.178
A LOT OF OTHER THINGS AND

01:48:38.245 --> 01:48:39.613
THAT'S THE ISSUE AND THAT

01:48:39.679 --> 01:48:40.947
REGARDLESS IF WE IF WE STAY

01:48:41.014 --> 01:48:44.184
STATUS QUO RIGHT NOW. AND YOU

01:48:45.385 --> 01:48:47.654
STILL GONNA HAVE THE BILL MUCH

01:48:47.721 --> 01:48:49.656
HIGHER ON THESE CHARGES THAT'S

01:48:49.723 --> 01:48:51.825
NOT GOING TO CHANGE SO FOR SOME

01:48:51.892 --> 01:48:53.660
OF THE CALLS A CALL THEN THAT

01:48:53.727 --> 01:48:55.228
WERE DISINGENUOUS ABOUT THAT IT

01:48:55.295 --> 01:48:56.563
DOES ACTUALLY CHANGE THAT PART

01:48:56.630 --> 01:48:58.465
OF IT THAT THAT IS AN ISSUE

01:48:58.531 --> 01:48:59.099
THAT NEEDS TO BE CHANGES SHOULD

01:48:59.165 --> 01:49:02.168
BE FAIR NO MATTER WHAT THE OF

01:49:02.235 --> 01:49:03.603
ROBBERS ROBBIE ABOUT RE COMMIT.

01:49:03.670 --> 01:49:07.841

WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR

01:49:12.712 --> 01:49:16.650
BRINGING A COMMONSENSE- REFORM

01:49:16.716 --> 01:49:17.217
MEASURE TO THE CURRENT BAIL

01:49:17.284 --> 01:49:19.219
SYSTEM. AND YOU KNOW WHETHER

01:49:19.286 --> 01:49:20.987
YOU ARE FOR OR AGAINST- THE

01:49:21.054 --> 01:49:23.490
BAIL SYSTEM. BUT HE WON

01:49:23.556 --> 01:49:26.426
ELIMINATED COMPLETELY OR DO YOU

01:49:26.493 --> 01:49:27.794
FEEL THAT- IT JUST NEEDS TO BE

01:49:27.861 --> 01:49:31.965
TWEAKED- FIXING THE INHERENT

01:49:32.032 --> 01:49:34.234
INEQUITIES IN THE CURRENT

01:49:34.301 --> 01:49:40.040
SYSTEM OR ARGUING THAT IT. FOR

01:49:40.106 --> 01:49:41.508
YOU CAN'T SUPPORT AN

01:49:41.574 --> 01:49:42.175
IMPROVEMENT TO THE CURRENT BAIL

01:49:42.242 --> 01:49:44.044
SYSTEM IT KIND OF MAKES NO

01:49:44.110 --> 01:49:47.047
SENSE- WHAT YOU TALKED ABOUT

01:49:47.113 --> 01:49:49.616
THERE IS AN INEQUITY WHERE IT

01:49:49.683 --> 01:49:52.118
IT. ACTUALLY IS MORE LUCRATIVE

01:49:52.185 --> 01:49:56.022
TO DO SOME- SOME OF CRIME- IN

01:49:56.089 --> 01:49:57.023
ONE COMMUNITY THAN IT IS IN

01:49:57.090 --> 01:49:59.426
ANOTHER BECAUSE OF THE BAIL

01:49:59.492 --> 01:50:02.362
SYSTEM WE HAVE. AND THIS IS A

01:50:02.429 --> 01:50:03.229
COMMON SENSE APPROACH TO FIXING

01:50:03.296 --> 01:50:05.999
THAT- OTHERS WHO WANT TO HAVE

01:50:06.066 --> 01:50:06.666
THAT OTHER GUY ARGUMENT CAN

01:50:06.733 --> 01:50:10.537
HAVE THAT- BUT- I'M GOING TO

01:50:10.603 --> 01:50:11.404
SUPPORT THIS BECAUSE THIS MAKES

01:50:11.471 --> 01:50:14.808
SENSE. AND THAT IT MAKES IT

01:50:14.874 --> 01:50:15.275
EQUAL PARTS THROUGHOUT

01:50:15.342 --> 01:50:16.543
CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU FOR

01:50:16.609 --> 01:50:20.747
BRINGING THANK YOU. YES MISTER

01:50:20.814 --> 01:50:23.316
MARKAY HAND THANK YOU MISTER

CHAIR- AND IF YOU CAN HER EIGHT

01:50:25.885 --> 01:50:27.654
AM THANK YOU MISTER COOPER FOR

01:50:27.721 --> 01:50:28.955
ENGAGING IN THIS IMPORTANT

01:50:29.022 --> 01:50:30.223
CONVERSATION THAT IS MENTIONED

01:50:30.290 --> 01:50:33.159
BY MY COLLEAGUES IT'S HAPPENING

01:50:33.226 --> 01:50:34.527
TOO MANY BILLS THIS- THIS

01:50:34.594 --> 01:50:36.363
LEGISLATIVE SESSION. AND YOU

01:50:36.429 --> 01:50:38.598
KNOW. PERSONALLY I DON'T

01:50:38.665 --> 01:50:39.699
BELIEVE IN THE MONEY WILL

01:50:39.766 --> 01:50:41.434
SYSTEM I THINK THAT DECIDING

01:50:41.501 --> 01:50:42.836
WHETHER SOMEONE STAYS IN JAIL

01:50:42.902 --> 01:50:43.737
BASED ON WHETHER THEY HAVE THE

01:50:43.803 --> 01:50:45.939
RESOURCES TO PAY BAIL ISN'T

01:50:46.006 --> 01:50:46.606
WHAT KEEPS OUR COMMUNITIES

01:50:46.673 --> 01:50:48.608
SAFER. I THINK IT SHOULD BE A

01:50:48.675 --> 01:50:51.077
QUESTION OF SAFETY AND RESCUE

01:50:51.144 --> 01:50:52.679
WHICH TO YOUR POINT IS A PART

01:50:52.746 --> 01:50:54.714
OF THIS BUT ONLY A PART OF IT-

01:50:54.781 --> 01:50:55.949
IT STILL COMES DOWN TO WHETHER

01:50:56.016 --> 01:50:57.951
OR NOT ONE CAN PAY. THE BILL

01:50:58.018 --> 01:51:00.353
THAT IS SET AND SO. I HEAR YOU

01:51:00.420 --> 01:51:01.654
I THINK THE INEQUITY YOU

01:51:01.721 --> 01:51:03.490
PRESENT IT IS COMPELLING AND I

01:51:03.556 --> 01:51:06.192
pTALK ABOUT JUDICIAL DISCRETION

01:51:06.259 --> 01:51:07.327
A LOT IN THIS COMMITTEE AND

01:51:07.394 --> 01:51:08.395
OTHERS AND I THINK IT MAKES

01:51:08.461 --> 01:51:09.963
SENSE FOR THE- FOR. THE

01:51:10.030 --> 01:51:11.131
JUDICIAL COUNCIL TO BE HAVING A

01:51:11.197 --> 01:51:12.465
CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT OUR

01:51:12.532 --> 01:51:13.299
BELL SCHEDULE SHOULD BE ACROSS

01:51:13.366 --> 01:51:15.468
THE STATE- MY CONCERNS WITH THE

01:51:15.535 --> 01:51:19.072
BILL- OBVIOUSLY. TESTERS ACTORS

01:51:19.139 --> 01:51:20.407
POINT AS WELL THAT OTHER

01:51:20.473 --> 01:51:21.608
CONVERSATIONS HAPPENING ABOUT

01:51:21.674 --> 01:51:22.542
WHETHER WE SHOULD HAVE MANY

01:51:22.609 --> 01:51:23.910
BELL AT ALL AND IT'S- I BELIEVE

01:51:23.977 --> 01:51:27.313
THE MOVE TOWARD. CONTINUING BUT

01:51:27.380 --> 01:51:28.782
MY CONCERN IS ALSO THIS PART

01:51:28.848 --> 01:51:30.917
WHERE YOU ARE SENDING IT AS THE

01:51:30.984 --> 01:51:32.519
MAXIMUM OF THE TO WHICH YOUR

01:51:32.585 --> 01:51:34.821
POINT DOES REDUCE IT FROM

01:51:34.888 --> 01:51:36.723
STOCKING BUT IT STILL SAYS. A

01:51:36.790 --> 01:51:38.024
LIMIT RIGHT IT'S AT THE HEIGHT

01:51:38.091 --> 01:51:39.659
LIMIT POTENTIALLY FOR BALANCE

01:51:39.726 --> 01:51:40.960
SO AGAIN WE CONTINUE TO HAVE

01:51:41.027 --> 01:51:43.963
THIS SYSTEM WHERE WE SET IT AT

01:51:44.030 --> 01:51:44.564
THE HIGHER COST OF THE CRIMES

01:51:44.631 --> 01:51:45.899
CHARGED IN HERE SOMEBODY WHO

01:51:45.965 --> 01:51:46.966
CAN'T PAY AND NOW THEY'RE

01:51:47.033 --> 01:51:48.201
INCARCERATED NOT BECAUSE THE

01:51:48.268 --> 01:51:50.003
JUDGES DECIDED. NECESSARILY

01:51:50.070 --> 01:51:51.571
THAT THEY ARE SOMEBODY WHO

01:51:51.638 --> 01:51:53.373
NEEDS TO BE HELD WILL BE

01:51:53.440 --> 01:51:54.140
ARRESTED SOCIETY AND AS POINTED

01:51:54.207 --> 01:51:55.442
OUT BY PUBLIC DEFENDERS THAT

01:51:55.508 --> 01:51:57.110
CAN LEAD TO. THEM LOSING THEIR

01:51:57.177 --> 01:51:58.812
JOBS AND THEIR HOMES WHILE

01:51:58.878 --> 01:52:00.780
PENDING TRIAL EVEN IF THEY

01:52:00.847 --> 01:52:01.581
DON'T POSE A RISK TO THE

01:52:01.648 --> 01:52:04.117
COMMUNITY. AND SO I PERSONALLY

01:52:04.184 --> 01:52:05.385
THINK THAT WE NEED TO GET TO A

01:52:05.452 --> 01:52:06.719
POINT WHERE THE QUESTION BEFORE

01:52:06.786 --> 01:52:08.955
THE COURT. ISN'T ABOUT MONEY

01:52:09.022 --> 01:52:10.590
BUT IT IS ABOUT THE SAFETY OF

01:52:10.657 --> 01:52:11.891
OUR COMMUNITY THE CRIMES

01:52:11.958 --> 01:52:13.193
COMMITTED WHETHER WE BELIEVE IF

01:52:13.259 --> 01:52:14.127
WE LET THIS PERSON ON THE

01:52:14.194 --> 01:52:15.562
STREET OUR COMMUNITY IS LESS

01:52:15.628 --> 01:52:17.764
CARE- AND SO I CAN'T SUPPORT

01:52:17.831 --> 01:52:19.232
THIS TODAY BUT I DO APPRECIATE

01:52:19.299 --> 01:52:22.001
THE CONVERSATION ANY IMPORTANT-

01:52:22.068 --> 01:52:23.002
THE IMPORTANT PART OF THE

01:52:23.069 --> 01:52:24.370
CONVERSATION THAT YOU RAISED

01:52:24.437 --> 01:52:25.505
ABOUT THE INEQUITIES ACROSS

01:52:25.572 --> 01:52:26.439
COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA. THANK

01:52:26.506 --> 01:52:28.241
YOU IN RESPONSE WHAT IT DOES

01:52:28.308 --> 01:52:33.413
THOUGH INSISTED THAT THE YOU.

01:52:33.480 --> 01:52:34.080
KNOW THE HIS BILL SO IT. A

01:52:34.147 --> 01:52:34.914
WON'T BE THE HIGHEST. GOING TO

01:52:34.981 --> 01:52:36.349
SET UP THE LOWER. SO IF THERE

01:52:36.416 --> 01:52:37.350
IS THEY'RE SICK OF. BILL WHAT

01:52:37.417 --> 01:52:38.885
THE- COUNCIL CAN DO. THEY CAN

01:52:38.952 --> 01:52:40.520
SAID THAT LOWER BILL SCHEDULE

01:52:40.587 --> 01:52:41.921
SO IN ESSENCE. IT WOULD BE

01:52:41.988 --> 01:52:44.023
LOWER BILL SCHEDULE SO. I GUESS

01:52:44.090 --> 01:52:46.793
PART OF THIS IS ALSO. IF ZERO

01:52:46.860 --> 01:52:49.195
BILL DOESN'T PASS. THEN THE

01:52:49.262 --> 01:52:50.530
OPTION IS WE'RE GONNA. REMAIN

01:52:50.597 --> 01:52:52.332
STATUS QUO. AND IN WITH THE BIG

01:52:52.398 --> 01:52:53.766
ISSUE IS. THE WHO'S POLICING

01:52:53.833 --> 01:52:55.668
THE JUDGES. THE REASON WE'RE IN

01:52:55.735 --> 01:52:57.770
THIS SITUATION. IS NOT. BECAUSE

01:52:57.837 --> 01:52:59.005
THE PUBLIC DEFENDER'S NOT

01:52:59.072 --> 01:53:00.640
BECAUSE DISTRICT ATTORNEYS. NOT

01:53:00.707 --> 01:53:01.474
BECAUSE A LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:53:01.541 --> 01:53:02.942
BECAUSE THIS LEGISLATURE. IS

01:53:03.009 --> 01:53:04.978
BECAUSE THE JUDGES. AND JUDGES

01:53:05.044 --> 01:53:06.212
ARE MAKING THAT DETERMINATION

01:53:06.279 --> 01:53:08.014
EVERY YEAR THEY MAKE THAT VISIT

01:53:08.081 --> 01:53:09.616
THAT. THE NORTH MAIN ISSUE. THE

01:53:09.682 --> 01:53:11.651
DIFFICULTIES AWARE OF THIS IT'S

THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS-

02:48:38.107 --> 02:48:39.909
WIFE MR FELDMAN TOUCH ON TODAY

02:48:39.976 --> 02:48:42.245
BUT WHAT I THINK WAS LAID OUT.

02:48:42.312 --> 02:48:45.181
AND IN HIS LETTER- VERY WELL

02:48:45.248 --> 02:48:47.417
WHICH IS THIS WHAT I BELIEVE

02:48:47.484 --> 02:48:48.418
FOR YOUR PRESENTATION TODAY IS

02:48:48.485 --> 02:48:50.687
AN UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE- BUT

02:48:50.753 --> 02:48:52.722
THAT THE LANGUAGE AS WRITTEN

02:48:52.789 --> 02:48:54.791
COULD STAND IN THE WAY OF LAW

02:48:54.858 --> 02:48:57.227
ENFORCEMENT PARTNERSHIP ON FOR

02:48:57.293 --> 02:48:59.462
EXAMPLE- ANTI TERRORISM TASK

02:48:59.529 --> 02:49:00.830
FORCE THAT HAPPENED BOTH AT THE

02:49:00.897 --> 02:49:03.366
FEDERAL AND THE LOCAL LEVEL AND

02:49:03.433 --> 02:49:05.068
YOU KNOW THEY SAY THE LANGUAGE

02:49:05.134 --> 02:49:07.103
IN SB FIFTY FOUR THAT ENSURE

02:49:07.170 --> 02:49:08.338
THAT THAT WORK WAS NOT FOR

02:49:08.404 --> 02:49:09.739
IMMIGRATION PURPOSES BUT WAS

02:49:09.806 --> 02:49:11.307
FOR ANOTHER PURPOSE AND THAT.

02:49:11.374 --> 02:49:12.509
I'M I'M CONCERNED THAT THAT

02:49:12.575 --> 02:49:15.144
WORK THAT I BELIEVE IS CRITICAL

THAT IF THEY DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH

02:50:39.128 --> 02:50:39.729
EVIDENCE TO CHARGE A PERSON

02:50:39.796 --> 02:50:42.165
CRIMINALLY. AND THAT THEY THINK

02:50:42.231 --> 02:50:44.534
THE PERSON IS UNDOCUMENTED- TO

02:50:44.601 --> 02:50:45.668
JUST HAND THEM TO ICE TO MAKE

02:50:45.735 --> 02:50:49.906
THEM DISAPPEAR. SO WHAT I. WHAT

02:50:49.973 --> 02:50:52.275
I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR ON. IS

02:50:52.342 --> 02:50:54.110

02:50:54.177 --> 02:50:56.012
INDIVIDUAL IS BORN. THEIR

02:50:56.079 --> 02:50:58.481
IMMIGRATION STATUS SHOULD NOT

02:50:58.548 --> 02:51:01.184
CONTINUE A PERPETUAL

02:51:01.250 --> 02:51:03.052
PUNISHMENT. THEY HAVE SERVED

02:51:03.119 --> 02:51:06.823
THEIR TIME. SOME ARE ACTUALLY

02:51:06.889 --> 02:51:08.725
IN THE PROCESS OF TRYING TO

02:51:08.791 --> 02:51:10.226

AND IS CURRENTLY IN AN ICE

02:51:22.105 --> 02:51:24.741
DETENTION FACILITY. I WOULD

02:51:24.807 --> 02:51:27.076
HATE THAT THIS BODY CONTINUES

02:51:27.143 --> 02:51:29.712
TO FEAR MONGERING OF IMMIGRANTS

02:51:29.779 --> 02:51:30.980
JUST SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY ARE

02:51:31.047 --> 02:51:32.782

CRIMINALS AND THE SUCH I THINK

02:53:52.955 --> 02:53:53.923

02:54:21.951 --> 02:54:23.586
THE ACTIONS THAT CAUSED THAT.

02:54:23.653 --> 02:54:27.056

UNDERSTAND THE ISSUE OF

02:54:38.100 --> 02:54:39.735
REHABILITATION AND MAKING SURE

02:54:39.802 --> 02:54:40.937
THAT THAT PERSON DOESN'T COMMIT

02:54:41.003 --> 02:54:42.705
THE SAME CRIMES BUT THE THING

02:54:42.772 --> 02:54:44.807
THAT'S THE SAME ISSUE WE FACE

02:54:44.874 --> 02:54:46.609
WITH ANY RESTORATIVE JUSTICE

02:54:46.676 --> 02:54:48.511
POLICIES THAT WE DEBATE. WHICH

02:54:48.578 --> 02:54:49.579

CROSS OUR FINGERS AND WE HOPE

02:55:05.361 --> 02:55:06.529
IT WORKS BECAUSE WE KNOW WHEN

02:55:06.596 --> 02:55:08.030
OUR SOULS THAT IT'S A BETTER

02:55:08.097 --> 02:55:10.399
WAY OF. OF DOING A CRIMINAL

02:55:10.466 --> 02:55:12.602
JUSTICE- A CRIMINAL JUSTICE

02:55:12.668 --> 02:55:13.536

ABOUT. MAKING IT FAIR FOR

02:55:34.257 --> 02:55:36.626

PEOPLE WHO STRUGGLED WITH THIS

02:55:49.372 --> 02:55:50.907
CONCEPT AND CERTAINLY WHAT WE

02:56:07.290 --> 02:56:09.759
ONCE SAID THAT AND I SAID A

02:56:09.825 --> 02:56:10.326
VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE I I'M

02:56:10.393 --> 02:56:11.961
GONNA SHARE SOME A LITTLE BIT.

02:56:12.028 --> 02:56:12.528
ONCE A PERSON TO SERVE THEIR

02:56:12.595 --> 02:56:15.998
TIME. WHETHER YOU'VE THROWN THE

02:56:16.065 --> 02:56:16.632
WHOLE BOOK I DON'T FOR HALF THE

02:56:16.699 --> 02:56:19.302
BOOK ADAM. THEY SERVE THEIR

02:56:19.368 --> 02:56:21.203
TIME SO SHOULDN'T THAT PERSON.

02:56:21.270 --> 02:56:23.673
MALE OR FEMALE BE TREATED

02:56:23.739 --> 02:56:26.042
EQUALLY TO ANYONE ELSE. WHO HAS

02:56:26.108 --> 02:56:27.743
SERVED THEIR TIME. WHICH MEANS

02:56:27.810 --> 02:56:30.246
GO BACK TO COMMUNITY. AND TRY

02:56:30.313 --> 02:56:31.914
TO BE A BETTER SELF. THAT'S

02:56:31.981 --> 02:56:34.417
REALLY WHAT ABOUT. BUT A LOT OF

02:56:34.483 --> 02:56:36.052
EARLY ONSET YOU CAN'T HAVE IT

02:56:36.118 --> 02:56:37.053
BOTH WAYS YOU HAVE TO SEE THE

02:56:37.119 --> 02:56:40.690
OTHER SIDE- A WHAT THIS DOES

02:56:40.756 --> 02:56:41.223
IMMIGRATION DEBATE IN THIS

02:56:41.290 --> 02:56:44.527
COUNTRY. NOW MOST OF US HAVE

02:56:44.593 --> 02:56:47.029
NEVER HAD- I HAVE NEVER HAD THE

02:56:47.096 --> 02:56:48.531
EXPERIENCE OF LIVING WITH

02:56:48.597 --> 02:56:49.699
UNDOCUMENTED PARENTS BUT I CAN

02:56:49.765 --> 02:56:54.270
TELL YOU I HAD. AND D. A. V. IT

02:56:54.337 --> 02:56:54.870
AND I KNOW MY COLLEAGUE HAS AS

02:56:54.937 --> 02:56:57.606
WELL. THE FEAR AND YOU CANNOT

02:56:57.673 --> 02:56:59.408
IMAGINE. THE NO THEIR PARENTS

02:56:59.475 --> 02:57:01.410
PROBABLY WON'T COME HOME EVERY

02:57:01.477 --> 02:57:03.579
TIME TO LEAVE THE HOUSE IS REAL.

02:57:03.646 --> 02:57:05.147
AND WHAT WE SAW HAPPEN FOUR

02:57:05.214 --> 02:57:06.983
YEARS AGO WITH FAMILIES PICKED

02:57:07.049 --> 02:57:08.351
UP ON THE STREETS AND- THE

02:57:08.417 --> 02:57:09.518
FOLKS THROWN OUT WE'VE HAD IN

02:57:09.585 --> 02:57:10.886
OUR COMMUNITIES OR CONSTANTLY

02:57:10.953 --> 02:57:13.956
UP AT WORK- PARENT LEAVE THE

02:57:14.023 --> 02:57:15.591
KID AND I SAW SONORA THAT

02:57:15.658 --> 02:57:17.059
THAT'S NOT A HIGH SCHOOL WE SAW

02:57:17.126 --> 02:57:18.561
IN OUR COMMUNITIES. FOLKS

02:57:18.627 --> 02:57:22.031
HIDING AND NOT SENDING THEIR

02:57:22.098 --> 02:57:22.598
KIDS TO SCHOOL BECAUSE THEY

02:57:22.665 --> 02:57:24.467
DON'T WANT TO LEAVE. BUT YOU

02:57:24.533 --> 02:57:25.768
CAN'T HAVE IT BOTH WAYS IF

02:57:25.835 --> 02:57:26.268
YOU'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT

02:57:26.335 --> 02:57:27.636
FAIRNESS AND EQUALITY GOTTA

02:57:27.703 --> 02:57:31.574
TALK ABOUT FEAR- IF YOU'RE IN A

02:57:31.640 --> 02:57:34.043
QUALITY LAWS. WHAT HAPPENS WHAT

02:57:34.110 --> 02:57:35.311
WHAT WITHOUT WITH THOSE PEOPLE

02:57:35.378 --> 02:57:36.512
ONCE YOU'VE GONE THROUGH THIS

02:57:36.579 --> 02:57:39.982
FRAMEWORK. THAT IS GOING TO BE

02:57:40.049 --> 02:57:41.917
IRONCLAD BUT NOTHING IS. A

02:57:41.984 --> 02:57:43.519
FRAMEWORK OF A PAROLE BOARD

02:57:43.586 --> 02:57:44.754
THAT PERSON HAS THAT

02:57:44.820 --> 02:57:47.056
OPPORTUNITY TO RESTART AND BILL

02:57:47.123 --> 02:57:48.691
THAT'S THAT SORT COMMUNITY

02:57:48.758 --> 02:57:50.426
THAT'S OUR FAMILY. BUT IF YOU

02:57:50.493 --> 02:57:52.895
TAKE UP PERSONAL WAY. AFTER

02:57:52.962 --> 02:57:55.765
THEY'VE SERVED THEIR SENTENCE.

02:57:55.831 --> 02:57:57.533
AND APART TO KNOW WHAT YOU'VE

02:57:57.600 --> 02:57:59.635
DONE BECAUSE WHAT WE'VE DONE. A

02:57:59.702 --> 02:58:01.170
SENTENCING AND HIRE OTHER

02:58:01.237 --> 02:58:03.939
FAMILY WITHOUT A DAD WITHOUT A

02:58:04.006 --> 02:58:06.108
MOM BEFORE THE ASSEMBLY. THAT'S

02:58:06.175 --> 02:58:06.876
THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CAN'T

02:58:06.942 --> 02:58:08.344
HAVE IT BOTH WAYS EITHER THERE

02:58:08.411 --> 02:58:09.779
WITH WITH THE START OF JUSTICE

02:58:09.845 --> 02:58:12.581
OR YOU'RE NOT EITHER BELIEVE

02:58:12.648 --> 02:58:13.215
THE RESTORATIVE JUSTICE. OR YOU

02:58:13.282 --> 02:58:15.317
DON'T. YOU TO JUST BELIEVE AND

02:58:15.384 --> 02:58:16.786
SOME PEOPLE HAVE A RESTORATIVE

02:58:16.852 --> 02:58:17.787
JUSTICE. AND NOT EVERYBODY

02:58:17.853 --> 02:58:19.789
ELSE. AND I DON'T SEE THE NOTES

02:58:19.855 --> 02:58:21.490
COMES UP A LITTLE BIT STRONGER.

02:58:21.557 --> 02:58:22.825
BUT THAT'S THE ARGUMENT WE FACE

02:58:22.892 --> 02:58:24.860
ABOUT WHAT WHEN IT COMES DOWN

02:58:24.927 --> 02:58:26.262
TO UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS. ALL

02:58:26.328 --> 02:58:27.229
WE COULD DO IT FOR EVERYBODY

02:58:27.296 --> 02:58:29.098
ELSE CAN'T DO A FOR SOMEBODY

02:58:29.165 --> 02:58:29.732
WHO'S BEEN DOCUMENTED BECAUSE A

02:58:29.799 --> 02:58:31.267
LITTLE DIFFERENT. THEY CAME IN

02:58:31.333 --> 02:58:33.636
A LITTLE DIFFERENT. THEY SMELL

02:58:33.702 --> 02:58:34.236
DIFFERENT THEY WORK A LITTLE

02:58:34.303 --> 02:58:36.439
DIFFERENT. WITH ALL KINDS OF

02:58:36.505 --> 02:58:38.407
NAMES ALL KINDS OF FLOWERS. AT

02:58:38.474 --> 02:58:40.109
THE END OF THE DAY. A HUMAN IS

02:58:40.176 --> 02:58:41.444
A HUMAN IS A HUMAN I HAVE A

02:58:41.510 --> 02:58:42.378
FRIEND A FRIEND OF MINE HE'S TO

02:58:42.445 --> 02:58:43.779
JOKE AROUND. AND YOU SAY NO THE

02:58:43.846 --> 02:58:45.181
ONLY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THAT

02:58:45.247 --> 02:58:45.748
PERSON OVER THERE WHO IS A

02:58:45.815 --> 02:58:47.550
CITIZEN. AND MY PARENTS WERE

02:58:47.616 --> 02:58:48.717
UNDOCUMENTED WAS A BURST LOW

02:58:48.784 --> 02:58:50.519
BUT THAT REALLY IS IT. SOME

02:58:50.586 --> 02:58:52.188
PERSONAL BURNOUT WHAT BORN ON

02:58:52.254 --> 02:58:52.721
ONE SIDE OF THE BORDER THE

02:58:52.788 --> 02:58:54.190
OTHER ON THE OTHER. AND MY

02:58:54.256 --> 02:58:55.624

THAT PEOPLE JUST **** NILLY

03:03:19.188 --> 03:03:21.090
LETTING PEOPLE OUT THAT IS DEAD

03:03:21.156 --> 03:03:22.591
THERE IS A PROCESS AND MAYBE

03:03:22.658 --> 03:03:24.293
THAT MAY BE PART OF THIS

03:03:24.360 --> 03:03:27.329
EDUCATING. EVERYBODY ON HOW

03:03:27.396 --> 03:03:30.899
DIFFICULT THIS PROCESS IS-

03:03:30.966 --> 03:03:33.402
BECAUSE CDCR DOES NOT. WANT TO

03:03:33.469 --> 03:03:35.904
LET SOMEBODY LOOSE. AND THEN

03:03:35.971 --> 03:03:36.972
THEY FIND OUT LATER DO

03:03:37.039 --> 03:03:38.607
SOMETHING REALLY HORRENDOUS

03:03:38.674 --> 03:03:40.109
BECAUSE GUESS WHERE THAT COMES

03:03:40.175 --> 03:03:42.211
BACK ON TO THE INSTITUTION AND

03:03:42.277 --> 03:03:43.779
SO THEY PROBABLY GO A LITTLE

03:03:43.846 --> 03:03:46.148
OVERBOARD TO ENSURE THAT-

03:03:46.215 --> 03:03:48.450
NOBODY JUST GETS OUT. IN FRONT

03:03:48.517 --> 03:03:52.321
FOR NOTHING. SO I THOUGHT. IF

03:03:52.388 --> 03:03:53.255
THERE'S NO MORE QUESTIONS YOU

03:03:53.322 --> 03:03:55.157
MAY CLOSE AND THAT'S KIND OF MY

03:03:55.224 --> 03:03:58.560
CLOSE TO THAT THAT WE- THAT WE-

03:03:58.627 --> 03:04:00.396
THAT WE MOVE ON AND THAT YOU

03:04:00.462 --> 03:04:04.566
KNOW WITNESSES GO AFTER THIS.

03:04:04.633 --> 03:04:07.703
SO THERE'S PEOPLE GET. HOW MANY

03:04:07.770 --> 03:04:09.538
MORE THAN THAT. OKAY SO THIS

03:04:09.605 --> 03:04:12.040
WILL GO THROUGH JUDICIARY WHICH

03:04:12.107 --> 03:04:13.041
PROBABLY HAVE EVEN MORE

03:04:13.108 --> 03:04:17.379
QUESTIONS. AND THROUGH- TO

03:04:17.446 --> 03:04:19.982
APPROACH SO WE CAN HAVE MORE

03:04:20.048 --> 03:04:21.884
DEBATE WE CAN BRING GIVE YOU

03:04:21.950 --> 03:04:23.886
TIME TO ALLOW THE POLICE CHIEFS

03:04:23.952 --> 03:04:26.422
SHERIFFS AND ANYONE ELSE WHO IS

03:04:26.488 --> 03:04:28.323
CONCERNED ABOUT THIS SO WE CAN

03:04:28.390 --> 03:04:30.259
CLARIFY HOPEFULLY HOPEFULLY

03:04:30.325 --> 03:04:33.762
WHAT WE'RE DING IS CLARIFY-

03:04:33.829 --> 03:04:36.031
THAT WERE THIS IS NOT A PROGRAM

03:04:36.098 --> 03:04:37.566
TO ALLOW. PEOPLE TO STAY IN

03:04:37.633 --> 03:04:39.768
THIS COUNTRY WHO ARE. WHO COULD

03:04:39.835 --> 03:04:41.703
BE POTENTIAL. POTENTIALLY

03:04:41.770 --> 03:04:44.072
DANGEROUS WHICH IS WHAT. MR

03:04:44.139 --> 03:04:47.509
QUIRK IS CONCERNED ABOUT. AND I

03:04:47.576 --> 03:04:51.447
MOVED TO BILLS THANK SIX ON. MY

03:04:51.513 --> 03:04:56.385
CLOSE. YES THANK YOU- AND THANK

03:04:56.452 --> 03:04:58.053
YOU FOR THE ROBUST CONVERSATION

03:04:58.120 --> 03:04:59.488
I JUST I WANNA CONTINUE TO

03:04:59.555 --> 03:05:01.123
CLARIFY A COUPLE OF THINGS THE

03:05:01.190 --> 03:05:03.025
VISION ACT WILL CONTINUE TO

03:05:03.091 --> 03:05:04.927
ALLOW THE JOINT TAX TASK FORCES

03:05:04.993 --> 03:05:06.428
IF THEY ARE CRIMINAL-

03:05:06.495 --> 03:05:07.763
ENFORCEMENT IF THEY'RE FOR

03:05:07.830 --> 03:05:09.765
CRIMINAL ENFORCEMENT PURPOSES

03:05:09.832 --> 03:05:11.533
NOT AN IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT

03:05:11.600 --> 03:05:12.568
PURPOSE THAT IS A KEY

03:05:12.634 --> 03:05:14.770
DIFFERENCE THE VISION ACT WILL

03:05:14.837 --> 03:05:16.805
ALSO CONTINUE TO ALLOW FOR

03:05:16.872 --> 03:05:18.307
CRIMINAL WARRANTS I THINK THAT

03:05:18.373 --> 03:05:19.608
WAS A QUESTION THAT WAS ASKED

03:05:19.675 --> 03:05:21.910
THE BILL DOES NOT STOP ICE FROM

03:05:21.977 --> 03:05:24.546
DOING THEIR JOBS AS THEY DO ON

03:05:24.613 --> 03:05:27.082
AN EVERYDAY. ULTIMATELY THIS IS

03:05:27.149 --> 03:05:28.851
ABOUT JUSTICE AND AN EQUAL

03:05:28.917 --> 03:05:31.787
JUSTICE SYSTEM FOR ALL. THE

03:05:31.854 --> 03:05:33.388
QUESTION IS DO YOU BELIEVE IN A

03:05:33.455 --> 03:05:35.858
JUSTICE SYSTEM THAT. IF AN

03:05:35.924 --> 03:05:37.059
INDIVIDUAL HAS SERVED THEIR

03:05:37.125 --> 03:05:39.027
TIME SHOULD THEY BE ALLOWED TO

03:05:39.094 --> 03:05:40.963
COME BACK INTO SOCIETY THAT IS

03:05:41.029 --> 03:05:42.698
THE BASIC FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION

03:05:42.764 --> 03:05:44.466
ABOUT THE JUSTICE SYSTEM. I

03:05:44.533 --> 03:05:45.834
BELIEVE THAT WE ARE TRYING TO

03:05:45.901 --> 03:05:48.670
CREATE A CALIFORNIA FOR ALL NOT

03:05:48.737 --> 03:05:50.906
A CALIFORNIA FOR SOME. WERE

03:05:50.973 --> 03:05:53.075
BASED ON THE COLOR OF YOUR SKIN

03:05:53.141 --> 03:05:55.611
OR YOUR NATIONAL ORANGE ORIGIN

03:05:55.677 --> 03:05:57.679
YOU ARE JUDGED DIFFERENTLY.

03:05:57.746 --> 03:05:59.748
THAT IS NOT THE PILLAR OF THE

03:05:59.815 --> 03:06:03.318
STATE. MEMBERS I HAVE SAID

03:06:03.385 --> 03:06:04.119
BEFORE AND I'LL JUST SHARE

03:06:04.186 --> 03:06:06.722
AGAIN. I AM A FORMALLY

03:06:06.788 --> 03:06:07.256
UNDOCUMENTED CHILD IN THIS

03:06:07.322 --> 03:06:09.791
COUNTRY. MY FAMILY FLED A CIVIL

03:06:09.858 --> 03:06:12.394
WAR. THERE WERE MANY

03:06:12.461 --> 03:06:14.062
OPPORTUNITIES FOR ME TO DO

03:06:14.129 --> 03:06:16.098
WRONG WHEN I WAS GROWING UP AND

03:06:16.164 --> 03:06:18.133
I DID BUT I WAS FORTUNATE TO

03:06:18.200 --> 03:06:19.902
HAVE A LOT OF SUPPORT WHERE I

03:06:19.968 --> 03:06:22.838
WAS GROWING UP. AND I BELIEVE

03:06:22.905 --> 03:06:24.673
THE REPRESENTATION MATTERS. WE

03:06:24.740 --> 03:06:26.441
MUST ENSURE. THAT ALL

03:06:26.508 --> 03:06:28.443
CALIFORNIANS THAT HAVE SERVED

03:06:28.510 --> 03:06:31.079
THEIR TIME. WON'T BE DENIED THE

03:06:31.146 --> 03:06:32.881
OPPORTUNITY TO REUNITE WITH

03:06:32.948 --> 03:06:33.982

SECOND CHANCE OF LIFE SIMPLY

03:06:36.618 --> 03:06:38.120
BECAUSE- THEY DID SOMETHING

03:06:38.186 --> 03:06:39.955
WRONG. PAID THEIR DEBT TO

03:06:40.022 --> 03:06:42.124
SOCIETY OR BECAUSE OF WHERE

THE EVENTS OF THE BORDERLINE

03:08:24.493 --> 03:08:25.527

STORIES THESE FAMILIES CONTINUE

03:08:33.068 --> 03:08:34.803
TO BE TORMENTED BY CONSPIRACY

03:08:34.870 --> 03:08:37.172

CLICK BAIT. AB TWO SIX EIGHT

03:09:03.732 --> 03:09:05.333
AMENDS AN EXISTING LAW THAT

03:09:05.400 --> 03:09:06.334
ALREADY ALLOWS FAMILIES OF

03:09:06.401 --> 03:09:08.437
MURDERED CHILDREN. TO PETITION

03:09:08.503 --> 03:09:09.871
A COURT TO HAVE THEIR CHILD'S

MURDER OF A SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD

03:09:15.243 --> 03:09:17.446
TELLS YOU CAME. OVER THE PAST

03:09:17.512 --> 03:09:18.814
DECADE THAT LAW WITH ITS

03:09:18.880 --> 03:09:20.515
IMPORTANT SAFEGUARDS HAS NOT

03:09:20.582 --> 03:09:22.184
RESULTED IN THE BERING ABOUT

03:09:22.250 --> 03:09:23.485
BARRING OF ACCESS TO THE VAST

03:09:23.552 --> 03:09:25.554
MAJORITY OF CHILD'S AUTOPSY

03:09:25.620 --> 03:09:28.123
RECORDS. IT WOULD ONLY APPLY IF

03:09:28.190 --> 03:09:30.258
A CRIMINAL ACT CAUSES THE DEATH

03:09:30.325 --> 03:09:31.693
OF THE VICTIM. AND THE

03:09:31.760 --> 03:09:33.862
PERPETRATOR IS CONVICTED OR

03:09:33.929 --> 03:09:35.897
THEY ARE ALL DEAD. I WANT TO

03:09:35.964 --> 03:09:37.833
STRESS THAT AB TWO SIX EIGHT

03:09:37.899 --> 03:09:38.934
ONLY APPLIES TO A DEATH THAT IS

03:09:39.000 --> 03:09:40.502
THE RESULT OF A CRIMINAL ACT

03:09:40.569 --> 03:09:42.404
NOT OF NATURAL CAUSES AN

03:09:42.471 --> 03:09:44.372
ACCIDENT. OR ONE THAT IS SELF

03:09:44.439 --> 03:09:46.675
INFLICTED. SIMPLY EXTENDS THE

03:09:46.742 --> 03:09:48.009
OFTEN ALREADY OFFERED TO FAMILY

03:09:48.076 --> 03:09:49.611
MEMBERS OF CHILD VICTIMS WHO

03:09:49.678 --> 03:09:52.214
DIED OF A CRIMINAL ACT TO

03:09:52.280 --> 03:09:53.849
VICTIMS OF ALL AGES. THIS BILL

03:09:53.915 --> 03:09:55.484
RISK RETAINS THE CRUCIAL

03:09:55.550 --> 03:09:57.052

CRIMINAL CONVICTION IS SECURED.

03:10:02.090 --> 03:10:03.258
HOWEVER IT ADDS THE IMPORTANT

03:10:03.325 --> 03:10:04.559
ALTERNATIVE THAT IS STILL TO BE

03:10:04.626 --> 03:10:06.194
SOUGHT AFTER CASES CLOSED BY

CONVICTION WILL EVER BE SECURED

03:10:12.067 --> 03:10:13.502

BILL. AND I WANT THAT TO BE A

03:28:50.017 --> 03:28:51.919
100% CLEAR. BECAUSE NOT ONLY

03:28:51.986 --> 03:28:53.454
DOES IT ONLY APPLY IN A VERY

03:28:53.520 --> 03:28:55.556
NARROW SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES ONE

03:28:55.623 --> 03:28:56.824
IN WHICH SOMEBODY HAS BEEN

03:28:56.891 --> 03:28:59.159

COMMITTED THE CRIME IS KNOWN TO

BE DECEASED. SO MANY OF THE

03:29:05.399 --> 03:29:05.799
EXAMPLES GIVEN BY THE

03:29:05.866 --> 03:29:08.435
OPPOSITION. AREN'T RELEVANT OR

SOMEONE IS ALLEGED DIED OF AN

03:29:10.137 --> 03:29:12.673

BEEN DECEASED OR- CONVICTED OF

03:29:17.645 --> 03:29:19.346
A CRIME SO IN THAT CIRCUMSTANCE

03:29:19.413 --> 03:29:21.282
THIS BILL WOULD NOT APPLY. THE

03:29:21.348 --> 03:29:23.150
SAME IS TRUE OF MR JUST

03:29:23.217 --> 03:29:24.818
COMMENT. OF OFFICER INVOLVED

03:29:24.885 --> 03:29:26.587

HAD BEEN CONVICTED. OR THE

03:29:28.555 --> 03:29:30.691
OFFICER IS DECEASED IN WHICH

03:29:30.758 --> 03:29:33.494
CASE. THE TRANSPARENCY IS THERE

03:29:33.560 --> 03:29:34.962
RIGHT THE VINCE OFFICERS BEEN

03:29:35.029 --> 03:29:36.363
CONVICTED OF THE MURDER WHY DO

03:29:36.430 --> 03:29:39.099
YOU NEED. IN THAT CASE THE

03:29:39.166 --> 03:29:40.868
PERSONAL DETAILS OF THESE

03:29:40.935 --> 03:29:42.336
PERSON THESE PEOPLE OF LIFE

03:29:42.403 --> 03:29:43.704
THAT FEELS. THEY'VE ALREADY

03:29:43.771 --> 03:29:45.072
BEEN VICTIMIZED IN THE WORST

03:29:45.139 --> 03:29:47.408
POSSIBLE WAY. WE TO VICTIMIZE

03:29:47.474 --> 03:29:48.575
THEM AGAIN BY ALLOWING THE

03:29:48.642 --> 03:29:50.577

AT THE TIME OF THEIR DEATH TO

03:29:52.279 --> 03:29:54.715
BE RELEASED. THAT FEELS. TO ME

03:29:54.782 --> 03:29:56.984
JUST WRONG AND I WANTED TO JUST

03:29:57.051 --> 03:29:58.252
SPEAK TO THE ISSUE BECAUSE I

03:29:58.319 --> 03:29:59.853
THINK THAT. THERE WAS A LOT OF

03:29:59.920 --> 03:30:01.622
DISINGENUOUS COMMENTS MADE BY

03:30:01.689 --> 03:30:02.222
THE OPPOSITION WHERE THE BILL

03:30:02.289 --> 03:30:04.258
WOULD NOT APPLY. AND I THINK

03:30:04.325 --> 03:30:05.225
THAT THIS IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT

03:30:05.292 --> 03:30:09.263
STEP. IN PROTECTING PEOPLE WHO

03:30:09.330 --> 03:30:10.998
HAVE PAID. A PRICE THE NEW.

03:30:11.065 --> 03:30:12.633
WANTS THEIR LOVED ONE TO PAY

03:30:12.700 --> 03:30:14.601
AND SO THE- THE SIMPLE ACT OF

03:30:14.668 --> 03:30:15.936
PROTECTING THEIR PRIVACY AND

03:30:16.003 --> 03:30:18.739
DEATH FEELS. RIGHT AND JUST AND

03:30:18.806 --> 03:30:20.441

THE AUTOPSIES ARE AT ISSUE

03:31:30.811 --> 03:31:32.312

ANSWER TO THOSE QUESTIONS

03:31:58.605 --> 03:32:01.842

APPLYING A GANG ENHANCEMENT

03:40:35.989 --> 03:40:37.457
MORE RIGOROUS I JUST WANT TO

03:40:37.524 --> 03:40:40.493
STATE. THAT THIS BILL DOES NOT

03:40:40.560 --> 03:40:42.228
SEEK TO MAKE THE APPLICATION OF

03:40:44.264 --> 03:40:45.932
AS WAS WRITTEN IN SOME OF THE

03:40:45.999 --> 03:40:47.767
LETTERS NOR DOES IT ELIMINATE

03:40:47.834 --> 03:40:50.036
IT ENTIRELY IT WOULD REQUIRE

03:40:50.103 --> 03:40:51.338
THAT SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE BE

03:40:51.404 --> 03:40:52.839

WE ASK FOR. IN ALL INSTANCES

03:40:55.775 --> 03:40:57.043

03:41:01.881 --> 03:41:03.617
THE PATTERN CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR.

03:41:03.683 --> 03:41:05.318
DIRECTLY CORRESPONDS WITH THE

03:41:05.385 --> 03:41:08.154
GANG AFFILIATION. IT IS

03:41:08.221 --> 03:41:09.456
IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE CLEAR

HUMAN COSTS TO OUR COMMUNITIES.

03:41:29.776 --> 03:41:31.111

03:41:31.177 --> 03:41:32.779
THREADED BY FEAR OF GANG AND

03:41:32.846 --> 03:41:34.381

THE LIST OF PREDICATE OFFENSES.

03:42:00.240 --> 03:42:01.374

SOLVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND

04:35:12.062 --> 04:35:12.896

04:35:17.000 --> 04:35:19.302
MADE. WE HAVE STUDIES THAT SHOW

04:35:19.369 --> 04:35:20.604
THAT INCREASE PENALTIES

04:35:20.670 --> 04:35:21.805
INCREASE SENTENCING DOES NOT

04:35:21.872 --> 04:35:23.506
DETER BEHAVIOR IN FACT FOR

04:35:23.573 --> 04:35:24.541
EVERY ONE YEAR OF ADDITIONAL

04:35:24.608 --> 04:35:25.909
SENTENCING. INCREASES

04:35:25.976 --> 04:35:28.078
RECIDIVISM. THERE ALL THE DOOR

LOSE THEIR LIVES SO. AWFULLY

04:35:37.187 --> 04:35:38.889
AND TRAGICALLY. BUT IS THERE

04:35:38.955 --> 04:35:41.491

04:35:44.527 --> 04:35:49.833
OF HIDDEN RUNS. WHAT I THINK IS

04:35:49.900 --> 04:35:54.237
IMPORTANT HERE IS FOR US TO SEE.

04:35:54.304 --> 04:35:58.441
THE IMBALANCE IN THE LAW. AND

LEAVE. DATA NOT WAS STANDING I

04:36:31.341 --> 04:36:34.044
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO.

04:36:34.110 --> 04:36:38.114
THINK ABOUT THE FAX OF

04:36:38.181 --> 04:36:40.650
INDIVIDUALS WHO HIT KILL AND

04:36:40.717 --> 04:36:48.024
LEAVE. AND SERVE. A YEAR. THOSE

04:36:48.091 --> 04:36:50.226
INDIVIDUALS AREN'T SILENT. THEY

04:36:50.293 --> 04:36:53.897
HAVE FRIENDS. THEY TALK THEY

COMMUNICATE. AND WHAT'S THE

04:36:57.600 --> 04:36:59.903
LESSON THEY LEARNED. THEY GOT

04:36:59.970 --> 04:37:04.774
OFF. WHILE GAVIN GLADDING WAS

04:37:04.841 --> 04:37:09.145
LYING ON THE STREET. WE ARE

04:37:09.212 --> 04:37:11.648
LOOKING HERE FOR A BALANCE OF

04:37:11.715 --> 04:37:15.385
JUSTICE. BETWEEN FLEEING AND

04:37:15.452 --> 04:37:19.222
STATING AND BEING A HUMAN BEING

04:37:19.289 --> 04:37:21.091

04:37:21.157 --> 04:37:22.625

04:37:22.692 --> 04:37:23.793
NO EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE ARE

04:37:23.860 --> 04:37:25.428

04:37:40.877 --> 04:37:43.813
CARDINAL SYSTEM INSTEAD OF

04:37:43.880 --> 04:37:44.948

TODAY OF INSURING PEOPLE THAT

04:54:36.892 --> 04:54:37.593
RECEIPT OF IT AND ACTUALLY

04:54:37.659 --> 04:54:39.528
RECOVER I JUST HAVE A

04:54:39.595 --> 04:54:41.296
CLARIFYING QUESTION WHICH IS. A

04:54:41.363 --> 04:54:46.268
LITTLE CONFUSED JUST- SAYS THAT

04:54:46.335 --> 04:54:47.369
YOU DON'T HAVE TO RETAIN

04:54:47.436 --> 04:54:49.872
INSTITUTIONAL- TREATMENT IN

04:54:49.938 --> 04:54:50.873
ORDER TO GET THE CREDIT OR IF

04:54:50.939 --> 04:54:53.208

04:54:53.275 --> 04:54:53.909
TREATMENT NOT ELIGIBLE FOR

04:54:53.976 --> 04:54:56.912
CREDIT. CAN WE- YEAH I KNOW

04:54:56.979 --> 04:54:59.081
THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION- THE

04:54:59.148 --> 04:55:00.916
REASON THAT THE GOVERNOR'S

04:55:00.983 --> 04:55:02.751
OFFICE AND CDCR AND I GOT

04:55:02.818 --> 04:55:04.787
TOGETHER. WAS BECAUSE TO

04:55:04.853 --> 04:55:07.589
CLARIFY EXACTLY THAT- IN FACT

04:55:07.656 --> 04:55:09.892
WHEN PEOPLE ARE INSIDE. THEY

04:55:09.958 --> 04:55:11.460
CAN PARTICIPATE AND SHOULD

04:55:11.527 --> 04:55:13.395
HOPEFULLY AND MATT TREATMENT

04:55:13.462 --> 04:55:15.831
PROGRAMS. BUT THEY DO THEN

04:55:15.898 --> 04:55:17.733
QUALIFY FOR EARLY RELEASE

04:55:17.800 --> 04:55:20.002
PROGRAMS. BUT THEY CAN IT

04:55:20.069 --> 04:55:22.004
CONTINUE ONCE THEY'RE RELEASED

04:55:22.071 --> 04:55:24.473
WITH DISSIPATE OUTSIDE. AS WELL

04:55:24.540 --> 04:55:27.009
AS PEOPLE WHO DID NOT- DO

04:55:27.076 --> 04:55:29.078
TREATMENT WITHIN THIS INSIDE

04:55:29.144 --> 04:55:31.713
AND THEN WE TALK ABOUT PAROLE.

04:55:31.780 --> 04:55:33.282
SO IT DOESN'T AFFECT THE

04:55:33.348 --> 04:55:34.583
CREDITS THAT THEY WOULD GET IF

04:55:34.650 --> 04:55:36.285
THEY PARTICIPATE INSIDE BECAUSE

04:55:36.351 --> 04:55:38.287
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. WHEN

04:55:38.353 --> 04:55:39.655
FOLKS ARE INSIDE THEY'RE

04:55:39.721 --> 04:55:40.989
ACTUALLY GETTING BENEFITS THAT

04:55:41.056 --> 04:55:43.158
WILL ENABLE THEM TO RE ENTRY

04:55:43.225 --> 04:55:45.527
SUCCESSFULLY AND WHAT WE FOUND

04:55:45.594 --> 04:55:47.930
OUT THAT WILL IS- WITHIN THE

04:55:47.996 --> 04:55:52.367
FIRST WEEK. OF EXITING PRISON.

04:55:52.434 --> 04:55:54.436
THERE'S UP TO AN EIGHT TIME A

04:55:54.503 --> 04:55:56.805
CHANCE OF OVERDOSE DEATHS FROM

04:55:56.872 --> 04:55:58.307
SO THE GOAL OF THIS IS TO

04:55:58.373 --> 04:55:59.808
PREVENT THAT IF THE PEOPLE OF

04:55:59.875 --> 04:56:01.610
SERVE THEIR TIME IN A WORKING

04:56:01.677 --> 04:56:03.178

WE SAVE FOUR DOLLARS. BACK ON

AT A BRICK AND MORTAR STORE IN

05:21:45.686 --> 05:21:47.321
RETAILER THAT CAN SELL IT AND

05:21:47.388 --> 05:21:48.956

05:21:58.198 --> 05:21:59.900
THING IS THAT THE POINT OF SALE

05:21:59.967 --> 05:22:01.268
AND THE NATURE OF THE

05:22:01.335 --> 05:22:02.436
ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH THAT SALE

05:22:02.503 --> 05:22:04.304
TAKES PLACE THAT THERE ARE

05:22:04.371 --> 05:22:05.706
BETTER CONTROLS WE ALSO KNOW

05:22:05.773 --> 05:22:07.341
FROM THE- DEPARTMENT JUSTICE

05:22:07.408 --> 05:22:08.842
