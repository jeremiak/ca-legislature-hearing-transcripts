BEFORE WE INVITE OUR FIRST PANEL TO BEGAN I'D LIKE TO MAKE A FEW INTRODUCTORY REMARKS. AND THEN SEE IF ANY OTHER COLLEAGUES WHO WOULD LIKE TO JOIN. BUT. REALLY WANTED TO BEGIN A FIGHT COULD- WITH SOMETHING THAT I HEARD THIS PAST SUNDAY AT CHURCH FROM MY PASTOR THAT WE AS A PEOPLE ARE CAPABLE OF GREATNESS AND I'D LIKE TO HUMBLY OFFERED THAT THE MOVEMENT OF HEALTH FOR ALL IS AN EXAMPLE OF JUST THAT AN EXAMPLE WHEN YOU LISTEN TO PEOPLE AND AMPLIFY THEIR VOICES THAT WHEN YOU WORK WITH ADVOCACY ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS CIBC HEALTH ACCESS AND THE LOTUS WORK THE FOUNDATION THAT WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE THE CHANGE THAT WE WANT TO SEE IN THIS WORLD. I'D LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT TO THANK THE GOVERNOR BECAUSE FOR MANY OF US WE FEEL AS IF OUR PRAYERS HAVE BEEN ANSWERED. THE VERY REASON THAT I RAN FOR OFFICE AND LEFT MY CAREER IN EMERGENCY MEDICINE CAME HERE TO SACRAMENTO WAS TO WORK TOWARDS UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE COVERAGE. AND MORE IMPORTANTLY UNIVERSAL ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS HEALTH FOR ALL WOULD HAVE HAPPENED YESTERDAY WE AND WE CAN'T WAIT FOR TOMORROW IT IS TODAY THAT WE MUST FOCUS ON THE HARD WORK OF IMPLEMENTATION AND ROLLING AND LOOK FORWARD TO THE CONVERSATIONS THAT WILL COME TODAY WITH THAT LET'S BEGIN. LET'S BEGIN WITH A PANEL ONE ON THE PROPOSED MEDICAL EXPANSION TO INCOME ELIGIBLE ADULTS TWENTY SIX TO FORTY NINE REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRATION STATUS. WE HAVE THREE PRESENTERS ON THE PANEL INCLUDING MICHELLE BOSS DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. J. C. COOPER STATE MEDICAID DIRECTOR AND CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF HEALTH CARE PROGRAMS FOR DH CS AND LUKE COST MORROW THAT WOULD BE L. A. ON. WILL HOLD ALL MEMBERS QUESTIONS UNTIL AFTER THE PRESENTERS HAVE INCLUDED CONCLUDED. LET US BEGIN WITH DIRECTOR BOSS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE REALLY THANK YOU FOR THOSE OPENING COMMENTS REALLY RESONATED WITH THAT I KNOW THE ENTIRE D. H. U. S. DEMANDED MINISTRATION. OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS CALIFORNIA HAS EXPANDED MEDICAID COVERAGE TO CHILDREN YOUNG ADULTS AND OLDER ADULTS AGE FIFTY AND OVER REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRATION STATUS. THE BUDGET BUILT ON THOSE EXPANSIONS AND INCLUDES EIGHT HUNDRED AND NINETEEN POINT THREE MILLION SIX HUNDRED THIRTY TÍNH POINT FIVE MILLION GENERAL FUND AND TWENTY TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR AND TWO POINT THREE BILLION ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION GENERAL FUND ANNUALLY AT FULL IMPLEMENTATION. TO EXPAND FULL SCOPE ELIGIBILITY TO ALL INCOME ELIGIBLE ADULTS AGE TWENTY SIX THROUGH FORTY NINE REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRATION STATUS BEGINNING NO SOONER THAN JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY FOUR MEDICARE WILL BE AVAILABLE TO ALL INCOME ELIGIBLE CALIFORNIANS. BY REMOVING A BEARD TO HELP ACCESS DUE TO IMMIGRATION STATUS THIS PROPOSAL PROVIDES COVERAGE TO THE REMAINING AGE GROUP OF UNDOCUMENTED INDIVIDUALS AND WOULD ENSURE THAT ALL LOW INCOME CALIFORNIAN ADULTS HAVE EQUITABLE ACCESS TO COMPREHENSIVE AND AFFORDABLE CARE. EQUITABLE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE OFTEN LEADS TO IMPROVE HEALTH OUTCOMES FINANCIAL SECURITY AND WORKER PRODUCTIVITY AND ULTIMATELY BETTER LIFE OUTCOMES. ONE OF THE QUESTIONS IN THE AGENDA IS- IT REGARDING THE NEED FOR A TWO YEAR DELAY IN IMPLEMENTATION WE PROPOSE A JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY FOUR START DATE FOR THE EXPANSION A FULL SCOPE MEDI CAL TO INDIVIDUALS AGE TWENTY NINE TWENTY SIX FORTY NINE. I TO ENSURE A SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION THIS EXPANSION WILL ADD APPROXIMATELY SEVEN HUNDRED FOURTEEN ADDITIONAL MEDICARE ENROLLEES AND IS ONE OF THE LARGEST EXPANSIONS OF MEDICAID ELIGIBILITY IN RECENT YEARS. AS SUCH THIS TRANSITION WILL REQUIRE EXTENSIVE COORDINATION BETWEEN DH YES COUNTY PARTNERS MANAGED CARE PLANS AND STAKEHOLDERS AND THIS INCLUDES THE DEVELOPMENT OF POLICY AND GUIDANCE NOTICES FOR AFFECTED INDIVIDUALS TO INFORM THEM OF THE EXPANSION. PROVIDING INFORMATION TO THOSE ENROLLED IN RESTRICTED SCOPE MEDICAL TODAY ABOUT THE TRANSITION TO FULL SCOPE COVERAGE. INSURING THAT MEDICARE RATES A MANAGED CARE PLAN NETWORK ADEQUACY REQUIREMENTS ARE APPROPRIATELY ADJUSTED TO REFLECT THE GROWTH IN ENROLLMENT. OF THESE ADDITIONAL MEDIC CAL ENROLLEES. ADDITIONALLY BETWEEN NOW AND JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY FOUR MANY SIGNIFICANT POLICY INVESTMENTS ARE BEING IMPLEMENTED RELATIVE TO MEDICARE ELIGIBILITY INCLUDING. RESUMING ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATIONS DUE TO THE END OF THE FEDERAL PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. IF A PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY WERE TO END IN APRIL REDETERMINATION WOULD NEED TO BEGIN MAY HAVE TWENTY TWENTY TWO. EXPANSION OF MEDICARE HEALTH TWO ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND NINETY EIGHT THOUSAND OLDER ADULTS AGE FIFTY AND OLDER REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRATION STATUS EFFECTIVE MAY ONE TWENTY TWENTY TWO. ELIMINATION OF THE MEDICAL ASAT TEST PHASE ONE WHICH RAISES THE ASSET LIMIT TWO. HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND AFFECTED JAIL JULY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TWO YOU KNOW. AND THE CONSOLIDATION OF COUNTY ELIGIBLE ELIGIBILITY SYSTEMS INTO ONE STATEWIDE AUTOMATED WELFARE SYSTEM SAWS AS REQUIRED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. MIGRATION IS SET TO BEGIN SEPTEMBER TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND AS A RESULT THE SAUCE WILL BE IN A STATE A FREEZE WHERE THEY KEEP IT CANNOT MAKE THAT PROGRAM CHANGES UNTIL THEY FULLY MIGRATE TO CAL FONG IN OCTOBER TWENTY TWENTY THREE. THE PROPOSAL ALSO CANNOT BE PHASED IN BY AGE GROUPS AS EACH STATE ESSENTIALLY EQUATES TO THE SAME LEVEL OF EFFORT BOTH FROM A POLICY AND SYSTEM PERSPECTIVE OF THE FULL PROPOSAL. THE CUMULATIVE IMPACT OF THE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES NECESSITATES THE PROPOSED STARTDATE OF JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. THANK YOU. NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM JC COOPER. I HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENT THANK YOU. NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM THE L. L. GOOD AFTERNOON BRITISH MORROW THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WE'RE TALKING NOTING THAT BASED ON THE MINISTRATIONS ESTIMATE THE PROPOSAL WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE NUMBER OF UNINSURED CALIFORNIANS. BETWEEN THE ADMINISTRATION'S ESTIMATE FOR THIS EXPANSION ALONG WITH THE OLDER ADULTS EXPANSION APPROVED LAST YEAR WHEN WE ROUGHLY ESTIMATE THE UNINSURED POPULATION IN THE STATE COULD BE REDUCED BY ABOUT ONE MILLION PEOPLE WHICH IS ROUGHLY ONE THIRD OF THE. CURRENT UNINSURED POPULATION IN THE STATE. WE WANT TO RAISE A FEW ISSUES FOURTEENTH EXPANSION- BUT WE KNOW THAT WE ARE CONTINUING TO EVALUATE THE MINISTRATIONS AND COMMUNICATE CERTAIN COSTS AND THAT ANY SUCH EXPANSION IS SUBJECT TO CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY IN TERMS OF THESE ESTIMATES. NOW CAN I CAN NOTE THAT IT DOES IT DOESN'T INVOLVE AN EXTENDED TIME BRING RELATIVE TO PAST EXPANSIONS AND IT HAS AN IMPACT ON ACCESS TO COVERAGE. A SHORT IMPLEMENTATION PRIME BRING SIMILAR TO THAT PAST EXPANSIONS COULD IMPROVE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE SOONER. THE END EXPECT. EXTENDED TIME FRAME COULD BE PARTICULARLY PROBLEMATIC FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE EIGHT OUT OF FOUR SKEPTICAL MEDI CAL IF THE TRUMP RUNNING TWENTY SIX. PRIOR TO GETTING ONE TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. IN SUCH CASES THESE INDIVIDUALS WOULD BE SHIFTED TO LIMITED SCOPE MEDIC HAL WHICH ONLY COVERS EMERGENCY SERVICE IN PREGNANCY- AND THEN WE MOVED BACK TO FULL SCOPE AFTER JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY FOUR CAUSING A LAPSE IN COVERAGE. WELL WE ARE CONTINUING TO ASSESS THE POTENTIAL NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS COULD BE IMPACTED BY THIS WE ESTIMATE THAT TYPICAL YEAR OF THE NUMBER OF UNDOCKING RESIDENTS YOU AGE OUT OF COVERAGE. IS. LIKELY IN THE LOW TENS OF THOUSANDS. THIS WOULD BE MUCH HIGHER END UP YOUR- DUE TO A THE FEDERAL. DON'T PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. COULD BE. FROM MAKING L. WELL THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY IS IN EFFECT EXCEPT IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE KNOW THAT THE MINISTRATION HAS STATED THAT IT WOULD BE WORKLOAD CHALLENGES WITH AN OLDER IMPLEMENTATION CONSISTENT CHANGES AT THE COUNTY LEVEL AND OTHER. TEMPORARY WORKLOAD DUE TO POLICY CHANGES THAT HAVE PEACEFUL IMPLICATIONS WE DEFINITELY RECOGNIZING THESE WATER CHALLENGES ARE REAL BUT THEY CAN INCREMENTAL APPROACH COULD EXPAND COVERAGE FASTER WITH MORE MANAGEABLE WORKLOAD IN. FOR EXAMPLE THE LEGISLATURE COULD TAKE STEPS TO PREVENT LOTS OF BOTH GOOD COVERAGE OF PEOPLE WHO AGEOUT OF COVERAGE PRIOR TO JANUARY. ONE TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. WE ARE HAPPY TO DISCUSS. HOW DO YOU LARGEST COULD BE STRUCK THE LEGISLATURE ADMINISTRATION- AND WILL BE RELEASED A PUBLICATION THAT COTTON WEEKS WITH A MORE IN DEPTH AND HOUSE THIS PROPOSAL. I WILL FOR THE TIME BEING WE RECOMMEND THAT TO THE EXTENT LAWCENTER IS INTERESTED IN ADOPTING. AN EXECUTIVE TIMELINE FOR ALL OR PART OF THE POPULATION IMPACTED BY THIS PROPOSAL AT THE REQUEST MINISTRATION FIND INFORMATION ON THE FEASIBILITY OF DOING SO. AS WELL AS POTENTIAL ALTERNATIVES WHICH COULD BUT IT'S NOT NECESSARILY INCLUDE OPTIONS RAISED- IN. THIS TESTING ON IT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WHAT THAT I WILL BRING BACK UP TO THE DÍAS TO SEE IF. MEMBERS HAVE QUESTIONS. C. NON I WILL KEEP IT WITH THE CHAIR- FIRST DIRECTOR I'D LIKE TO FOLLOW UP ON THE FILLIOS COMMENTS REGARDING- THOSE WHO CURRENTLY ARE AGING OUT. AFTER THE AGE OF TWENTY SIX AND- WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO WORK WITH YOUR DEPARTMENT AND FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN. NOT TO HAVE THEM HAVE COVERAGE. HAVE TO KICK THEM OFF AND THEN RE ENROLL THEM IN A FEW YEARS FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN KEEP THAT CONTINUITY AND- WOULD APPRECIATE AN OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH YOU ON THAT IF YOU'RE AMENABLE TO THAT WOULD ALSO WANT TO ENSURE THAT WE ENGAGE OUR COUNTY PARTNERS BECAUSE THIS WOULD LIKELY INVOLVE MANUAL OVERRIDES IN IT YOU KNOW IMPACT SOME OF THE COUNTY PROCESSING AND AS WELL SO. HAPPY TO ENTERTAIN CONVERSATIONS AND WORK TOWARDS THIS BUT RECOGNIZING THAT THIS- THIS TYPE OF LOGIC IS PROBABLY MORE OF A MANUAL OVERRIDE. I'M WOULD LIKE TO FOLLOW UP WITH ONE SPECIFIC QUESTION ABOUT THE TBL- WITHIN YOUR PROPOSAL IT STATES THAT THIS WILL ONLY OCCUR AFTER THE DIRECTOR DETERMINES. THAT THE SYSTEMS HAVE BEEN PROGRAMMED FOR IMPLEMENTATION. I WAS HOPING YOU COULD ELABORATE ON WHAT THIS MEANS SPECIFICALLY AND- WHETHER OR NOT. THAT'S REFERRING TO THE I. T. SYSTEM UPGRADES YOU WERE-MENTIONING EARLIER AND HOPING YOU COULD PROVIDE SOME CLARITY. I THINK WE GENERALLY INCLUDE THAT IS A STANDARD JUST WRITING THIS IN THAT THAT THE SYSTEM IS READY TO PROCESS THIS NEW ELIGIBILITY- AUTOMATICALLY AND THAT IT'S NOT A MANUAL PROCESS AND SO I THINK THIS IS STANDARD LANGUAGE THAT WE'VE INCLUDED- IN PAST EXPANSIONS. WITH THAT I WILL HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN AND MOVE ON TO YOU PANEL TO. THE WILL- CONTINUE TO WORK TO ENSURE THAT THE HUNDRED AND NINETY EIGHT THOUSAND. ELDERS AND SENIORS YOU MENTIONED TO BE ENROLLED BY MAY OF TWENTY TWO. THE WE HAVE A PLA THAT WE ARE DOING OUTREACH AND WORKING WITH PEOPLE ON THE GROUND TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE- ENROLLING AS MANY AS POSSIBLE. UNTIL WOULD APPRECIATE AN OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH YOUR DEPARTMENT AS WELL. TO MAKE SURE WE'RE DOING ALL WE CAN TO. HELP THOSE IN ROLE WHO SHOULD HAVE COVERAGE BY MAY OF THIS YEAR. DEFINITELY THANK YOU WITH THAT WE WILL MOVE ON TO THE PANEL TO TELEHEALTH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE PANEL ONE WE WILL HAVE TO TELL HEALTH PROPOSALS HERE THE FIRST IS A B. C. P.

COOPER AND SHE WILL BE HANDLING THE REMAINING ITEMS FOR EACH THE US AS WELL. GOOD AFTERNOON- ONE THING I WOULD JUST POINT OUT BECAUSE IT'S A QUESTION A NUMBER OF ITEMS FOR THE COMMITTEE TODAY- BUT REALLY IN REGARDS TO OUR TRAILER BILL. I'M BEING RELEASED WE JUST WANTED TO SAY. YOU KNOW WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF GETTING ALL TRAILER BILL OUT ON A FLOW BASIS AS SOON AS WE CAN- AND WE'LL BE UPDATING PEOPLE ALONG THE WAY WE DO RENT HIS ANTICIPATED COMING OUT IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS. TO ALLOW SUFFICIENT TIME FOR THE LEGISLATURE STAKEHOLDERS TO REVIEW ANY PROPOSED CHANGES AND- ARE WORKING TO GET THAT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. IN REGARDS TO OUR TELEHEALTH PROPOSAL THE DEPARTMENT DID A RELEASE THAT ON FEBRUARY THIRD- WITH WITH MANY DETAILS HOWEVER GIVE IT OUT A LITTLE BIT OF IT A FRAMING OF THAT PARTICULAR PIECE IN YOUR OTHER QUESTIONS TODAY. SO IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN PRIOR TO THE ONSET OF THE PANDEMIC DH CS HAS UNDERTAKEN. A PRETTY LARGE PROCESS TO REVIEW AND REFINE ITS TELEHEALTH POLICIES. THIS PROCESS RESULTED IN A REVISED MORE EXPANSIVE POLICIES THAT AFFORDED SUBSTANTIAL FLEXIBILITIES PROVIDERS TO MAKE CLINICALLY APPROPRIATE DECISIONS REGARDING THE USE OF TELEHEALTH ACROSS. MULTIPLE AREAS INCLUDING MEDICARE FEE FOR SERVICE AND MANAGED AND MANAGED CARE- AFTER THE ONSET OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY OF FOOD HAVE DISCUSSED. OTHER DEPARTMENT IMPLEMENTED A NUMBER OF ADDITIONAL FLEXIBILITIES ON DURING THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY TO BROADEN THE FLEXIBILITIES AROUND TELEHEALTH SERVICES. CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN LEADING- IT HAS BEEN A LEADING STATE IN REGARDS TO THE EXPANSIVENESS OF COVERAGE AND REIMBURSEMENT FOR SERVICES DELIVERED VIA TELEHEALTH. IN DH CS IS VERY COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TO ENABLE BROAD TELEHEALTH COVERAGE AND PARITY OF REIMBURSEMENT BETWEEN IN PERSON AND BDO AND AUDIO ONLY TELEHEALTH VISITS. ALL POSE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY POLICIES ARE PROPOSED BY THE DEPARTMENT WERE GUIDED BY SEVEN KEY PRINCIPLES. EQUITY ACCESS. STANDARD OF CARE ASIAN CHOICE. CONFIDENTIALITY STEWARDSHIP. AND PAYMENT APPROPRIATENESS. AND WE WORK CLOSELY WITH THE TELE HEALTH ADVICE GROUP FURTHER. OFF OUT THESE ITEMS. AS AGREED IN THE BUDGET LAST YEAR DH YES FORGET. ADVISORY WORKGROUP. OF THIS WORK GROUP CONSISTED OF MEMBERS- WITH VERY SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTISE- AND OF REALLY ALLOWED US TO LOOK AT. WHAT WHERE WE WOULD ADOPT VARIOUS BILLING AND UTILIZATION MANAGEMENT PROTOCOLS FOR TELEHEALTH. WORKGROUP MET THREE TIMES IN THE FALL OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. WORKGROUP MEETINGS WERE OPEN TO THE PUBLIC AND FOLLOW UP FOLLOWING EACH MEETING ELECTRONIC SURVEYS WERE CONDUCTED TO SOLICIT ADDITIONAL WORKERS INPUT- I'M IN DHS CONDUCTED A DOZEN ONE ON ONE INTERVIEWS WITH INDIVIDUAL STAKEHOLDERS REPRESENTING A VARIETY OF ORGANIZATIONS AND PERSPECTIVES. WE WANTED TO ENSURE THAT WE WERE ENGAGING WITH A BROAD GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS TO INFORM OUR ULTIMATE RECOMMENDATIONS. IN DECEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE DEPARTMENT PUBLISHED THE TELEHEALTH WORKGROUP REPORTS. AND REVIEW THE POLICY APPROACHES THE WORKGROUP- DELIBERATED ON. ON FEBRUARY THIRD TWENTY TWENTY TO BE RELEASED THE PROPOSAL AS I MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY. AND WE WILL BE HOSTING A WEBINAR ON FEBRUARY SIXTEENTH 2% THE TELEHEALTH POLICY PROPOSAL TO THE ADVISOR. GROUP AND OTHERS PROBABLY. I'M TO GO OVER A HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW OF THE POST PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY TELEHEALTH POLICY I'M I'LL GO THROUGH A NUMBER OF THE MAIN PROPOSAL ITEMS- DOMINANTLY THOUGH WE ARE MAINTAINING MANY OF THE POLICIES INTRODUCED DURING THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. INCLUDING THE CONTINUED COVERAGE OF SYNCHRONOUS VIDEO AUDIO ONLY AN ASYNCHRONOUS TELEHEALTH COVERAGE ACROSS MULTIPLE SERVICE AND DELIVERY SYSTEMS- AS THE DURING THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY THIS INCLUDES EVEN ACROSS OUR NINETEEN FIFTEEN SEE RAVERS. IN VARIOUS DELIVERY SYSTEMS WE ARE ALSO PROPOSING TO CONTINUE PARITY IN REIMBURSEMENT LEVELS BETWEEN IN PERSON SERVICES IN SELECT TELEHEALTH MODALITIES- AND REMOVING THE SITE LIMITATIONS ON ACTUATES THESE. HOWEVER AFTER CONSULTING EXTENSIVELY WITH THE TELEHEALTH ADVISORY WORKGROUP HE ALSO IMPLEMENTED A NUMBER OF NEW POLICY APPROACHES INFORMED BY THAT GROUP- AND I WILL WALK THROUGH THOSE NOW. ALLOWING THE ESTABLISHMENT OF NEW PATIENTS ONLY THROUGH IN PERSON FACE TO FACE OR SYNCHRONOUS VIDEO SUBJECT TO CERTAIN PROTECTIONS. PROHIBIT THE ESTABLISHMENT OF NEW PATIENTS USING AUDIO ONLY OR ASYNCHRONOUS TELEHEALTH. THE DEPARTMENT BELIEVES THIS WILL BE TO INCREASE ACCESS TO CARE BY STABBING NEW PATIENTS VIA TELEHEALTH WHILE IMPROVING THE ABILITY OF PROVIDERS TO VALIDATE IDENTITY OF THE PATIENT. THEREBY IMPROVING PROGRAM INTEGRITY AND ENSURE A DEEPER LEVEL OF INITIAL PATIENT PROVIDER COMMUNICATION IS AVAILABLE FOR THE INITIAL VISIT THAT OFTEN REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT EVALUATION AND ASSESSMENT. THROUGH JUST THE DISCUSSION WITH THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE AND STAKEHOLDERS AN EXCEPTION WAS MADE FOR FQHCS ARE FOR THE USE OF ASYNCHRONOUS TELEHEALTH WHEN CERTAIN CONDITIONS ARE MET SUCH AS. THE VIRTUAL DENTAL HOME INITIATIVE. WE ALSO WILL BE REQUIRED THE USE OF SPACE MODIFIER TO IDENTIFY THE TELEHEALTH MODALITIES USED INCLUDING THE ADOPTION OF NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED CPT CODE FOR AUDIO ONLY VISITS. I WOULD NOTE SINCE WE ROLLED OUT THE POSSIBILITIES DURING PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCIES SO QUICKLY. NOT ALL OF THE VARIOUS MODALITIES HAD A SEPARATE MODIFIER THIS WILL NOW ALLOW US TO SEPARATE THE USE OF AUDIO ONLY FROM OTHER VIDEO OR OTHER MODALITIES WHICH WILL BE CRITICAL AS WE MOVE FORWARD IN THE VALUATION. AS WELL AS- OVERALL PROGRAM INTEGRITY. ADDITIONALLY WE ARE LOOK AT A NUMBER OF PATIENT PROTECTIONS AND HOW TO ENHANCE THOSE RELATIVE FEW. TELEHEALTH INCLUDING STRENGTHENING CONSENT LANGUAGE FOR PATIENTS INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO FACE TO FACE SERVICES. THE USE OF TELEHEALTH BEING AN OPTION OF THE BENEFICIARY RECEIVING INFORMATION ON THE LIMITATIONS AND RISKS OF SERVICES BEING DELIVERED VIA TELEHEALTH. AVAILABILITY OF TRANSLATION SERVICES AND PHASING IN A REQUIREMENT THAT INSURERS INDIVIDUALS HAVE THE CHOICE OF TELEHEALTH MODALITY WHEN CARE IS PROVIDED VIA TELEHEALTH. AN OPTION FOR IN PERSON CARE. ADDITIONALLY A LOOKING TO ADOPT THE USE OF EVALUATION AND MANAGEMENT CODES AND ASSESSMENTS- IN MANAGEMENT BECAUSE THE DELIVERING TELEHEALTH SERVICES VIA AUDIO ONLY MODALITY- THIS AUTHORS PROVIDERS AN ADDITIONAL AND MORE ACCURATE OPTION TO IDENTIFY BRIEF AUDIO ONLY CHECK IN INTERACTIONS WITH PATIENTS. INCREASE THE ACCESS TO CARE BY ALLOWING A MEDICAID MANAGED CARE PLANS MENTAL HEALTH PLAN AND RECOMMEND IT- MEDIC HELP ORGANIZE DELIVERY SYSTEMS I'M TO USE CLINICALLY APPROPRIATE AUDIO VIDEO SYNCHRONOUS INTERACTIONS AS A MEANS TO DEMONSTRATE COMPLIANCE WITH NETWORK ADEQUACY. TIME AND DISTANCE STANDARDS THE ACS HAS DONE AN EXTENSIVE REVIEW OF HOW THIS IS BEING IMPLEMENTED ACROSS THE NATION AND WE HAVE FOUND OTHER STATES ARE ALSO BEGINNING TO ESTABLISH PARAMETERS FOR CONSIDERING TELEHEALTH PROVIDERS IN THEIR NETWORK ADEQUACY STANDARDS- AND SO WE WILL ALSO BE CONSIDERING THAT AND YOU'LL SEE THAT IN OUR PROPOSAL. AS WELL. A NUMBER OF CONSIDERATIONS. WITH RESPECT TO THE- OP- LEVERAGING TELEHEALTH MODALITIES AND- PRESERVING PATIENT PROTECTIONS ARE SIMILAR IN THE COMMERCIAL AND MEDICARE MANAGED CARE MARKETS I'M STATE SEEMS TO BE ESTABLISHING GUARDRAILS AND SIMILAR MATTERS FOR COMMERCIAL PLANTS AND MEDICAID PROGRAMS. PARTICULARLY AROUND TELEHEALTH ONLY PROVIDERS WE HAVE DONE THE NATIONAL SCANNED TO REALLY HELP INFORMAL RECOMMENDATIONS. IN LIGHT OF- THE PROPOSAL AS WELL. AND LASTLY IN REGARDS TO ONGOING MONITORING OF PROVIDERS DO YOU SEE US WILL CONTINUE TO APPLY RISK BASED APPROACH BY EXPANDING ANALYTICS AND ALGORITHMS DEVELOPED TO EFFECTIVELY IDENTIFY SUSPECTED TELEHEALTH ACTIVITY TO BE AUDITED OR INVESTIGATED. DURING EXTENT EXPANSION OF OUR PROGRAM INTEGRITY OUR PROGRAM HERE AT THE DEPARTMENT. CURRENT RISKS HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED- INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED YOU ARE CODING TIMING COMPLEXITY OF SERVICES PROVIDED. PROVIDER SERVICES VIA TELEHEALTH THAT WOULD BE MORE APPROPRIATE FOR IN PERSON SERVICES MISREPRESENTING THE VIRTUAL SERVICE PROVIDED BILLING FOR SERVICES NOT RENDERED AND KICKBACKS. THE TELEHEALTH RESEARCH AND EVALUATION PLANT IS CURRENTLY UNDER THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE WORKGROUP HAS RECOMMENDED SPECIFIC RESEARCH QUESTIONS WHICH WILL BE ADDRESSED IN THE PLAN. I'M SUCH AS HOW TELEHEALTH CONTRIBUTES TO ACCESS TO CARE. OF FOR DIFFERENT POPULATIONS THE IMPACT CLINICAL OUTCOMES FOR SPECIFIC CONDITIONS AND THE USE COMPARES AS THE USE OF COMPARING IN PERSON VISITS TO OUR YOU KNOW VARIOUS TELEHEALTH MODALITIES ACROSS THOSE VARIOUS POPULATIONS. THE MONITORING AND REPORTING OF TELEHEALTH UTILIZATION WILL CONTINUE OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS AND THEN IT WILL ALSO BE CHANGED AS WE GET OUTSIDE OF SOME OF THESE INITIAL FEW YEARS TO REALLY MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE CONTINUING TO EVALUATE THE HEALTH OUTCOMES. IMPACT OF THESE VARIOUS MODALITIES. I'M BLESSED WITH JUST ONE TO. ONE OF THE QUESTIONS RAISED SPECIFICALLY IN REGARDS TO PROVIDERS HAVING A REQUIREMENT TO EVENTUALLY OFFER BOTH VIDEO AND AUDIO SERVICES WHICH WAS A RECOMMENDATION WITHIN OUR PROPOSAL. OF MANY PROVIDERS INCLUDING SAFETY NET PROVIDERS- IMPROVED INFRASTRUCTURE TO OFFER VIDEO SERVICES DURING THE PANDEMIC. DURING THE WORKGROUP PROCESS WE HEARD AGREEMENT ACROSS THE BOARD THAT IT WAS IMPORTANT FOR BENEFICIARIES TO HAVE A CHOICE IN THEIR MODALITY OF CARE. THEY ASKED DH YES TO PHASE IN A REQUIREMENT AND NOT HAVE IT BE EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY WHICH IS WHAT THE DEPARTMENT IS PROPOSING IN NO SOONER THAN JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY FOUR FOR THAT RECOMMENDATION. WE THINK THE MODALITIES SHOULD BE DRIVEN BY WHAT'S BEST SERVES THE PATIENT CARE AND THE PREFERENCES ABILITIES OF THE BENEFICIARY AND DON'T WANT BENEFICIARIES TO BE FORCED TO USE AUDIO. BASED ON THE- PROVIDERS PREFERENCE OR UNWILLINGNESS TO MAKE THE INVESTMENTS I TO IMPROVE PATIENT CARE. WE HAVE LESS EVIDENCE AND EFFECTIVENESS AND QUALITY FOR AUDIO ONLY CARE- AND OFTEN OFFERING CHOICE OF THE MODLITIES WE FEEL IS IMPORTANT TO ENSURE THAT BENEFICIARY CHOICES DRIVING. OF THE MODALITY THAT IS BEING USED A GIVEN THE PAYMENT PARITY PROVISIONS WE ARE CONTINUING. UP FOR IN PERSON AUDIO ONLY VIDEO AND WE RECOGNIZE THAT OFFERING AUDIO LOOP ARE YOU ONLY CAN BE- SOMETIMES MORE CONVENIENT FOR PROVIDERS I MEAN WE TAKE THE UNDER RECOGNITION KNOWING THE INVESTMENTS ARE FOR SOME OF THE VIDEO ONLY- AT AND WE WILL TAKE THAT AS WE CONTINUE TO ENGAGE STAKEHOLDERS ON A PROPOSAL. AND THAT CONCLUDES MY COMMENTS AT THIS TIME AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE'LL BRING IT BACK UP TO THE DENTIST. TO SEE IF ANY MEMBERS HAVE QUESTIONS. EXCUSE ME- NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM HOW SHE DOES WITH THE L. L. THANK YOU THANK YOU DR ARAMBULA AB KOREA SHEET WITH THE ALLEY OOP WE JUST HAVE A FEW COMMENTS TO RAISE ON THE NET CAL. L. IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR RADIO- JUST THE AD WILL REVIEW IT WHEN IT BECOMES AVAILABLE AND FOLLOW UP IF WE HAVE ADDITIONAL COMMENTS- THE ADMINISTRATION DID SORT OF MAKE THAT FACT SHEET AVAILABLE WHICH DESCRIBES THE COMPONENTS OF THE GOVERNOR'S. TELEHEALTH PROPOSAL AND WE'VE HAD A CHANCE TO REVIEW THAT- WE WOULD JUST RAISE A FEW COMMENTS FOR LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION ON A FEW ASPECTS OF THE PROPOSAL- FIRST THE PROPOSAL YOU KNOW AS MENTIONED EARLIER GENERALLY PROHIBITS AFTER THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY ENDS THE ESTABLISHMENT. OF NEW PATIENTS THROUGH- AUDIO ONLY OR ASYNCHRONOUS TELEHEALTH MODALITIES- BUT DOES A LOT OF PCS TO PROVIDE FOR SPECIFIC EXEMPTIONS TO THIS REQUIREMENT BASED ON. STAKEHOLDER FEEDBACK- IN ADDITION TO THE ONE THAT THE ADMIN JUST NOTED FOR FQHCS- THE LEGISLATURE DISTINGUISHED TO CONSIDER HOW THIS ASPECT THE PROPOSAL WILL. IMPACT SERVICE DELIVERY AND MONITOR WHAT SPECIFIC EXEMPTIONS TO THIS POLICY END UP BEING DEVELOPED GOING FORWARD AS PART OF THIS PROCESS- SECOND YOU KNOW WE FIND THE ADDITION OF SPECIFIC BILLING MODIFIERS TO IDENTIFY TELEHEALTH VISITS BY MODALITY TO BE. APPROPRIATE AS THESE BILLING MODIFIER TO ALLOW FOR. THEIR CAPACITY TO TRACK THE DELIVERY OF TELEHEALTH SERVICES- AND MAY ULTIMATELY HELP WITH EVALUATING THE IMPACTS OF THE VARIOUS TELEHEALTH ANALOGIES ON PATIENT OUTCOMES. THIRD GIVEN PROPOSER. FOR ANY PROVIDER MAKING TELEHEALTH SERVICES AVAILABLE TO THEM BY BOTH- UP LIVE VIDEO AND AUDIO ONLY BY TWO THOUSAND TWENTY FOUR THE LEGISLATURE MAY WISH TO JUST CONSIDER WHAT ADDITIONAL CAPACITY- SUCH AS NECESSARY INFRASTRUCTURE- YOU KNOW BEYOND SORT OF WHAT. PROVIDERS HAVE ACCESS TO NOW THEY WILL NEED TO SORT OF MEET THIS REQUIREMENT- INCLUDING WHETHER THIS CAPACITY OR NEED FOR CAPACITY VARIES BY GEOGRAPHIC REGION THROUGHOUT THE STATE- AND WHETHER SORT OF ADDITIONAL STATE SUPPORT WILL BE NEEDED FOR THESE PROVIDERS TO MEET THESE REQUIREMENTS- FINALLY THE ADMINISTRATION INDICATES THAT IT WILL DEVELOP. A RESEARCH PLAN FOR EXAMINING HOW TELEHEALTH UTILIZATION AS IMPACTED ACCESS QUALITY AND OUTCOMES IN PROVIDER IN ROLE THE EXPERIENCES AND MEDIC HOW- YOU KNOW WHILE WE FIND THIS TO BE A POSITIVE DEVELOPMENT THE LEGISLATURE MAY WISH TO SORT OF MONITOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THAT ALTERNATE PLAN. AND WHAT DETAILS ARE NOT BEING INCORPORATED WITHIN IT- THOSE ARE ALL OF OUR COMMENTS AT THIS TIME AND WE'RE HAPPY TO PROVIDE FURTHER ASSISTANCE WHERE NEEDED. THANK VERY MUCH WE'LL BRING IT UP TO THE DIOCESAN BEGIN WITH ASSEMBLYMEMBER ALMOST. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND JUST THE COMMENT ON THE ON THE PREVIOUS- PRESENTATION AS FAR AS A TELE HEALTH NET I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT- TELEHEALTH NET THAT WE ARE INCLUDING- URBAN INDIAN HEALTH CENTERS AS FAR AS THE DIALOGUE- IN THE COMPONENT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ALL. MOVING IN THAT SPACE TO MAKE SURE THAT TELEHEALTH THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR ALL- IN IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA CLEARING THE CALIFORNIA INDIAN PEOPLE AND I KNOW THAT. LATER ON ON- ISSUE- THIRTEEN WILL TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THAT BUT I JUST WANTED TO. MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE CHIMING IN ON THE SUCCESS OF TELEHEALTH THAT BUT FOR ALL IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU AYE I WILL BEGIN MY- FIRST QUESTION FOR G. C. COOPER AND I LOOK FORWARD TO THE A COMPANY TRAILER BILL. BUT WHEN YOU SUBMITTED I WAS HOPING YOU COULD ALSO PLEASE PROVIDE A SIDE BY SIDE OR CROSSWALK OF THE CURRENT. PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY PROPOSALS COMPARED TO WHAT WOULD CONTINUE. BEYOND THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. AND HOPING YOU CAN PROVIDE THAT WHEN THE TRAILER BILL BECOMES AVAILABLE. THANK YOU FOR THAT REQUEST WILL BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO PROVIDE- A CROSSWALK ADD TO THE LEGISLATURE TO AN INFORMED DECISION THE LARGEST ITEM I WOULD A FLAG IS REALLY THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE NEW PATIENT ACROSS ALL MODALITIES THAT WAS. SOMETHING THAT WAS EXPENDED EXPLICITLY DURING THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY BUT WE'D BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO PROVIDE THAT ROSTOCK INCLUDING THE NEW OUR BENEFITS YOUR PERFECT PROTECTIONS I WHICH WE ARE PROPOSING ONLY FOR THE POST PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY ITEMS THAT WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO PROVIDE THAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MY NEXT QUESTION IS FOR DAN SOUTHERN- IN YOUR CONCEPT PAPER YOU TALKED ABOUT UTILIZATION MANAGEMENT PROTOCOLS FOR TELEHEALTH I WAS HOPING YOU COULD PLEASE ELABORATE ON THAT AND CAN YOU PROVIDE SOME REASSURANCE. YOU DON'T FORESEE UTILIZATION MANAGEMENT. AS A TOOL TO LIMIT UTILIZATION FOR COST PURPOSES SO MUCH SO THAT IT DIMINISHES THE OVERALL VALUE. AND POTENTIAL VALUE OF TELEHEALTH. THAT'S FOR D. THREE OVERALL. CHECK THE CHURCH CARE COULD YOU REPEAT THAT FIRST PORTION OF THE QUESTION FOR ME YEP AND APOLOGIES FOR- SAYING DOWN SOUTHERN I BELIEVE THE QUESTION IS FOR DH YES- IT'S THANK YOU. SO J. C. COOPER CAN YOU SET YOUR REPEAT THAT QUESTION JUST TO MAKE SURE I GET. EVERYTHING YOU'RE WANTING FROM US PLEASE I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT TALK ABOUT UTILIZATION MANAGEMENT PROTOCOLS FOR TELEHEALTH I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND. AND HOPING YOU CAN GIVE US SOME REASSURANCE REASSURANCE THAT THIS WON'T LIMIT UTILIZATION FOR COST PURPOSES SO MUCH THAT IT DIMINISHES THE POTENTIAL VALUE OF TELEHEALTH. THANK YOU YES THE ALTERNATELY AND MANY OF OUR DISCUSSIONS WITH THE ADVISOR GROUP WE DIDN'T REALLY MOVE FORWARD IN REGARDS TO MANY KIND OF FORMAL UTILIZATION MANAGEMENT PROTOCOLS FOR EXAMPLE CAPS OR- A NUMBER OF VISITS PER MODALITY. ULTIMATELY WHAT WE ARE LEANING TOWARDS IS IMPLEMENTING THE FLEXIBILITIES DURING THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY BUT REALLY ENFORCING BENEFICIARY CHOICE ALONG THE WAY IN REGARDS TO THE BEST MODALITY FOR THE SERVICES BEING PROVIDED. AND THEN OF COURSE ALLOWING PROVIDERS TO USE THEIR CLINICAL JUDGMENT AND ASSESSMENT IN REGARDS TO WHICH MODALITY IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE UP FOR THE BENEFICIARY I WAS STILL MAINTAINING- PAYMENT PARITY IS WHERE WE LANDED IN SO WE WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THAT BEARD. YOU KNOW VARIOUS WAYS LOOKING AT PROGRAM INTEGRITY AND THEN THE EVALUATION TO INFORM IF IN THE FUTURE WE NEED TO EVALUATE ANY ADDITIONAL UTILIZATION MANAGEMENT ITEMS BUT AT THIS TIME I DID NOT ULTIMATELY RECOMMEND A LARGE NUMBER OF U. M. CONTROLS WITHIN. THE WORKER FEEDBACK THAT WE RECEIVED. THANK YOU VERY. WITHOUT ALL THANK ALL THE PANELISTS FOR PANEL TO WE WILL MOVE ON THE PANEL THREE. ON THE CAL HERE'S BCP.

UP TO THE MISSION OF THIS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES IS TO PROVIDE CALIFORNIANS WITH ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE INTEGRATED HIGH QUALITY HEALTH CARE I'M INCLUDING MEDICAL DENTAL MENTAL HEALTH SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT SERVICES IN LONG TERM CARE ON NOW I WILL DO A HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW OF THE ASSONANCE MEDI CAL SPENDING TO BE APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED TWENTY THREE POINT EIGHT BILLION TOTAL FUNDS TWENTY SIX POINT EIGHT BILLION GENERAL FUND. FOR THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR REFLECTING A SLIGHT INCREASE OF ZERO POINT 5% IN TOTAL FUNDING OF FOUR POINT SPENDING COMPARED TO ESTIMATES FROM THE BUDGET ENACTED LAST SUMMER THE MAJOR DRIVERS OF THE CHANGE IN THE ESTIMATE- IN REGARDS TO GENERAL FUND SPENDING INCLUDES APPROXIMATELY. ONE BILLION RELATED TO THE REDUCE CODE NINETEEN COSTS PRIMARILY RESULTING FROM ADDITIONAL SAVINGS FROM INCREASED AFTER NOT BEING AVAILABLE THROUGH JUNE OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO- PARTIALLY OFFSET BY ADDITIONAL CASE LOW COST OF FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY THREE MILLION RELATED TO THE SHIFT OF MULTI YEAR SPENDING- INTO LATER YEARS A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY NINE MILLION RELATED TO INCREASE FOR OUR- INCREASE FUND FROM THE HOSPITAL QUALITY ASSURANCE FEE FOR CHILDREN OF COVERAGE. ON ANY ADDITIONAL HUNDRED SEVENTY MILLION RELATED TO REDUCED ARE PROJECTED COSTS FOR THE KALENJIN ARTICULATION AND FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTY EIGHT MILLION RELATED. TO THE STATE ONLY CLAIMING. R. FOR BUT YEAR- THE DEPARTMENT FOR SPENDING IN MEDICARE TO BE A HUNDRED THIRTY TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION TOTAL FUNDS. THIRTY FOUR POINT NINE BILLION GENERAL FUND THIS REFLECTS A SEVEN POINT 1% INCREASE IN TOTAL FUNDING. A 30% INCREASE IN GENERAL FUND SPENDING COMPARED TO THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR. A GROWTH IN PRODUCTION- OUR GROWTH IS PROJECTED IN MEDICARE FUNDING- AND SPENDING IN BUDGET YEAR RELATES TO A VARIETY OF FACTORS- OUTLINED IN DETAIL IN THE COMMITTEE'S AGENDA. ARE TO HIGHLIGHT A FEW A MAJOR ISSUES THE GENERAL FUND COSTS ARE PROJECTED TO GROW SIGNIFICANTLY IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE AS INCREASED FEDERAL FUNDING FOR MEDICAID ALL IS THE SAME TO ENDS. IF I'D BASED ON THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY ENDING- AND ROCKCASE LOADS REMAIN HIGHER THAN- OTHERWISE. I WOULD BE L. A. AS IN- WHAT CASELOADS REMAIN HIGHER THAN THEY WOULD OTHERWISE BE ELIGIBLE FOR GIVEN THE GRADUAL REDETERMINATION OF EVERYONE OVER A TWELVE MONTH PERIOD OF TIME- I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT THERE ARE NO. OF THINGS UP. IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THAT WOULD INCREASE THOSE COSTS- FOR A FEW JUST TO MENTION THINGS LIKE THE FOUR YEAR COST OF THE FULL SCOPE OF COVERING OLDER ADULTS FIFTY AND- OLDER REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRATION STATUS. BEHAVIORAL HEALTH BRIDGE HOUSING AT THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR THE CHILDREN YOUTH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INITIATIVE. ELIMINATION OF CERTAIN EIGHTY NINETY SEVEN REDUCTIONS PREVIOUS PROP FIFTY SIX SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT. AND RATE INCREASES MOVING TO PERMANENT RATE INCREASES ON USING GENERAL FUND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF MOBILE CRISIS BENEFIT. OF REDUCED MEDICARE PREMIUMS TO ZERO THERE'S FINANCING OUR OUR NURSING FACILITY FINANCE REFORM IN EQUITY AND PRACTICE TRANSFORMATION PAYMENTS. I KNOW NUMBER OF THOSE ITEMS WILL BE A REVIEW TODAY AND OUR FUTURE HEARINGS I LOOK FORWARD TO DISCUSSING EACH OF THOSE IN THOSE RESPECTIVE TIME PERIODS. REGARDING CASELOADS ARE THE COMMITTEES QUESTIONS ON CASELOAD. OF THE PANDEMIC HAS RESULTED IN A SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS ENROLLED IN MEDI CAL THE INCREASE IS PRIMARILY DUE. TO THE CONTINUOUS COVERAGE REQUIREMENT THAT IS TIED TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY WHICH PREVENTS MOST ON DISTANT ROMANCE OF FROM THE PROGRAM. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ASSUMES THE MEDICAL CASE LIVE GROWING TO A PEAK OF OVER FIFTEEN MILLION AFTER WHICH ELIGIBILITY WILL BE DETERMINED GRADUALLY OVER THE TWELVE MONTH PERIOD. THE EXPANSION OF FULL SCOPE MEDICAL COVERAGE TO INDIVIDUALS AGE FIFTY AND OVER REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRATION STATUS IS PROJECTED TO RESULT IN OVER A HUNDRED EIGHTY. THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS RECEIVING POST OF COVERAGE BY THE END OF THE FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. HOWEVER WHILE THE DEPARTMENT'S CASELOAD PROJECTIONS TO INCLUDE A SMALL- OVERALL INCREASED- A FEW THOUSAND CASES FOR EXAMPLE DUE TO THIS EXPANSION THE VAST MAJORITY OF THOSE WILL GAIN FULL SCOPE COVERAGE THROUGH THE- EXPANSION ALREADY HAVE RESTRICTED SCOPE COVERAGE AND MEDICARE. AND ARE ALREADY REFLECTED IN THE DEPARTMENT'S CASELOAD PROJECTIONS ARE. THESE INDIVIDUALS WILL SIMPLY BE SWITCHING FROM I'M RESTRICTED SCOPE COVERAGE TO FULL OF COVER PROJECT. IN THIS AND MICHAEL AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WE WILL FROM THE L. L. THANK YOU MOREOVER THE L. A. L. WE RECENTLY RELEASED OUR ANNOUNCES A MAJOR ADJUSTMENTS THE MEDICAL BUDGET ALL BE TALKING ABOUT THIS IS A VERY HIGH LEVEL- WITH A POTENTIAL EXEMPTION UP ADMINISTRATIONS CAREFUL SOMETIMES WE GENERALLY FIND ADMINISTRATORS MEDICAL ESTIMATES TO BE REASONABLE. WE WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE IT ON ITS UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS. OVER THE COMING MONTHS. FIRST ON THE INCREASE IN FUND KNOW THE TO OF PROPOSED INCREASE OF ABOUT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND SPENDING BETWEEN TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO AND TWENTY THREE. TWENTY THREE THIS TRANSLATES TO ABOUT A 30% INCREASE YEAR OVER YEAR I HAVE ABOUT 80% OF THIS- PROVIDES TECHNICAL ADJUSTMENTS. AND THE REMAINING TWENTY PERCENT. REFLECTS NEW DISCRETIONARY PROPOSALS THAT WOULD IMPLEMENT IN TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE. ON THE PHD. POLITICAL EMERGENCY. THIS IS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY IN THE MEDICAL BUDGET AND ISN'T THIS SEEMS EXPIRATION THE MINISTRATION- WOULD MEAN FOR JUNE TWENTY TWENTY TWO- WHAT IT DOES ULTIMATELY AND THIS WILL. TRIGGER TWO MAJOR THINGS OR IF THEY'LL BE A MENTOR- DECREASE IN FINAL FOUR MATIC CAL. AND ALSO THAT THERE IS SOMETHING OF BUILDING TERMINATIONS- THAT WOULD BE A BIG DROP IN CASELOAD AS THE- ADMINISTRATION'S NOTED JOIN PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. THERE'S BAD IT UP ACTIVELY APPLAUSE ON THE BUILDING TERMINATIONS FOR MOST PEOPLE A MEDIC CAL WHICH THE LAN CABLE. TO GROW SUBSTANTIALLY. THAT MEANS THE OF THE THAT AMOUNT OF FUNDING THAT IT ON STATE RISK AND PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY MORE THAN OFFSETS AT AMOUNT. SO IF THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY EXTENT THE JUNE- THERE COULD BE SUBSTANTIAL FISCAL SIGN FOR THE STATE- MICHAEL. RANGE OF HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND. FOR EACH NINETY DAY EXTENSION. IN TERMS OF THE CASELOAD ASSUMPTION. WE FIND THAT THEY ARE OF. DUE TO SLOWER ALTHOUGH STILL POSITIVE CASE OF GROWTH IN RECENT MONTHS AND WHAT WAS THE SCENE IN THE BUDGET. AND WE KNOW THAT THE BUDGET YOUR- OF AND HAVE A GOOD ONE THAT HE H. E. ON AND DATE AND PROPERTIES. I ALSO DIFFER DIMINISH ON K. THE NAY. NONE OF THE WEAPONS THAT TO DEVELOP DETERMINE. ARE WHAT CAR COULD IN HIGH. CASE SUCH AS THE NEW YORK PERSONS INSTANT. THIS IS SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR FISCAL ESTIMATES WHAT CASELOAD. A FINAL ISSUE THAT I WOULD RAISE IT IS RELATED TO THE MCO TAX WHICH THE TOP ONE MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS- THANK YOU THE- I'M NOT THE REVENUE FROM THIS TAX IS USED OFTEN GENERAL FUND COSTS AND MEDICARE. IS TAX GENERATED UP AVERAGE NET GENERAL FUND BENEFIT OF OVER ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. AND IS ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS INCLUDES FEDERAL FUNDING TO THE STATE OTHERWISE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO TALK ON THE TAX. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET DOES NOT PROPOSE TO EXTEND AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS DEADLOCK WOULD LOVE TO EXPIRE HALFWAY THROUGH TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE RESULT IN THE LOSS OF THIS ROUGHLY ONE POINT FIVE BILLION GENERAL FUND BENEFIT. THE MILITARY HAS NOTED THAT LIKE BIG CHANGES AROUND WHICH NCOS PARTICIPATED IN MEDICAL MANAGED CARE DID WAS DELIBERATE BUT YOU'RE ONLY AS WELL AS ANTICIPATED VOLATILITY IN THE CASE OF COMPLICATED WE KNEW ALL UP AND. SEALED TAX. WE AGREED IT IS RID YOU MAKE CAUSE CHANGE. BUT THESE WOULD BE. IN NATURE. NOT THE OPPORTUNE I. OF A HELP CENTER SORT OUT. I THINK YOU ARE GOING TO THREE OPTIONS FOR THE LAST TO CAN. FOR ALLEGED COULD WITH THE AND TAX BASED ON THE EXISTING FOR ONE. CALGARY OR OVER THAT HOW EVERYBODY SHERMAN SAID THE CHANGE IN TIME TO NOT ABOUT HIS. CAR TOLD TWENTY FOUR. OR TWENTY FOUR LATER YEARS LEGISLATION NEED TO CONSIDER WHEN IT WOULD BE FEASIBLE TO ENTERING. INTO TALKS. ABSOLUTELY THE NEW. LEGISLATURE COULD MORE YEAR RE AUTHORED THAT TALKS THAT WOULD BE IN PLACE BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER THE REBOOT YOUR MEANT. A LOT OF VACATIONS YOUR DRAFT CHALLENGES INTRODUCED BY THE WEEK WHAT YOU WANT. AND FINALLY THE LEGISLATURE COULD ALLOW THE MCO TAX TO BLOCKS AND THEN WE KNEW IT AT A LATER DATE SUCH AS THE TWENTY TWENTY FOUR TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. THE STATE HAS A BETTER IDEA WHICH INSTILLS ABOUT HIS PAY AND MEDICAL MANAGED CARE AND. WHAT LITTLE BIT WILK. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WITH OPENING UP THE DIE TO SEE ANY MAN. HAVE THE NONE- I WOULD LIKE TO ASK THE DEPARTMENT ON PAGE THIRTY THREE OF THE AGENDA. THERE'S A LINE ITEM FOR FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTY EIGHT MILLION COST RELATED TO ADDITIONAL DRUG REBATES. AND WAS HOPING YOU COULD PROVIDE SOME CLARITY TO THAT LINE ITEM. SO I THINK I MAY NEED TO. BRING IT BACK JUST TO MAKE SURE I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT WE ARE REFERRING TO THERE THERE'S A NUMBER OF FACTORS THAT CAN IMPACT REBATES IT'S GOING TO BE A COMBINATION OF THAT CALIBER ACTS WITH THE INCREASE OF EVERY BATES BEING ASSUMED. WE ALSO HAVE SOME INTERACTIONS IN REGARDS TO AND I DISAPPEAR AND THAT CCS AND G. H. B. P. R. REBATES BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE KNOW WHAT'S COMPILED IN GROUP UNDER THE FULL OP FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY EIGHT WOULD BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION TO YOU. AFTER THE HEARING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I WILL THANK ALL OF THE PANELISTS FOR PANEL FOR WE WILL MOVE ON TO PANEL FIVE. ON THE NOVEMBER TWENTY TWENTY ONE FAMILY HEALTH ESTIMATE WE WILL HAVE TO PRESENTERS DIRECTOR.

MAIN FACTOR FOR THE REDUCED ESTIMATES SPENDING IN THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR- IS REDUCE COSTS RELATED TO KOBE NINETEEN AND- ENROLLMENT AND PACKS I'M ENROLLMENT IS THE ONLY A CCS HAS DROPPED SOMEWHAT DUE TO THE PANDEMIC DUTY INDIVIDUAL SHIFTING TO MEDIC CAL CCS THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE UTILIZING SERVICES AND EVERY WOMAN COUNTS PROGRAM HAS ALSO AND I'M SOMEWHAT LOWER SENSE THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY BEGAN ALTHOUGH UTILIZATION IS INCREASING AND- APPROPRIATE- AS WE AS AS PRIOR TO KIND OF PRE PANDEMIC LEVELS.

IF ONE OR MORE ULTRASOUNDSARE NOT PERFORMED BASED ON LACK OF CLINICAL NECESSITY PROVIDERS- MAY STILL BUILD THE BUNDLED RATE HOWEVER BECAUSE THE BUNDLED RATE REFLECTS THE COST OF AT LEAST OF AT LEAST TWO OLDER SOUNDS THE MODIFIER MUST BE USED WHEN FEWER THAN TO OFFER SOUNDS ARE PERFORMED. WHEN A PROVIDER IS UNABLE TO PERFORM AN ABORTION COMPLETION ASSESSMENT OR FOLLOW UP VISITS WHICH MAY INCLUDE A PATIENT NOT SHOWING UP FOR A VISIT OR PARTICIPATING IN THE ASSESSMENT- REDUCE THE LEVEL OF PAYMENT REDUCTION ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE OF MODIFIER FIFTY TWO THE DEPARTMENT REDUCED THE PAYMENT REDUCTION ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE OF MODIFIER FIFTY TWO FROM TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE GIVEN THOSE HOSTILITIES WE WANTED.

IT WOULD INCLUDE NURSES OF ALL TYPES- YOUR THING SERVICES MAKES A DIRECT IMPACT ON OUR THE CARE PROVIDED TO MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES AND NURSING SHORTAGES HAVE BECOME MORE CRITICAL SENSE AT THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. ADDITIONALLY NURSES ARE A VITAL COMPONENT OF THE MEDICAL WORKFORCE- BOTH IN RURAL AREAS WHERE LICENSED PHYSICIANS AND SURGEONS MAY NOT BE READILY AVAILABLE AND IN MEDICALLY I DIDN'T UNDERSERVED URBAN AREAS. DEVOID OF ADEQUATE A LICENSED HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS AND MEDICAL SPECIALISTS. IT ALSO INCLUDES- DURABLE MEDICAL EQUIPMENT ARE FOCUSED IN A SUBSET OF THOSE SERVICES AROUND OXYGEN AND RESPIRATORY SERVICES AS WELL AS RESPIRATORY CARE PROVIDERS OF DME OMPONENT IS A CONTINUATION OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. A FLEXIBILITY THAT WAS PUT IN PLACE ADDITIONALLY DH CS HAS IDENTIFIED SIGNIFICANT HEALTH DISPARITIES IN CHRONIC RESPIRATORY DISEASES ESPECIALLY ASTHMA. IT IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR CLOSING THOSE GAPS ARE INCREASING RESPIRATORY CARE IS ALSO NEEDED IN LIGHT OF THE WILDFIRES THAT WE EXPERIENCE IN CALIFORNIA ON A REGULAR BASIS YOU REALLY THINK IT'S IMPORTANT AS WE CONTINUE TO LOOK AT QUALITY HEALTH OUTCOMES IN THE SPACE. WE ALSO WERE INCLUDING ARGUE- AUDIOLOGISTS AND HEARING AID DISPENSERS ONTO A LINE WITH THE EXPANSION OF HEARING AID COVERAGE IN ENSURE CHILDREN HAVE A FULL ACCESS TO NEEDED AUDIOLOGY AND HEARING AID SERVICES. INCLUSION OF CHRONIC DIALYSIS CLINICS- WAS A CRITICAL ITEM. AS YOU WOULD IMAGINE PRODUCT DIALYSIS CLINICS SERVE TO PROVIDE LIFE SUSTAINING DIALYSIS SERVICES FOR PATIENTS WITH END STAGE RENAL RENAL DISEASE WHEN PATIENTS DON'T RECEIVE DIALYSIS SERVICES THEY WILL RAPIDLY DOES DETERIORATE CLINICALLY. AND WITHIN DAYS I TO THE POINT OF NEEDING VARIOUS OTHER EMERGENT DIALYSIS FOR EMERGENCY RETIREMENT DEPARTMENT OR HOSPITALIZATION SO A CRITICAL NEED FOR MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES. ADDITIONALLY ALTERNATIVE BIRTHING CENTERS GIVEN THE REIMBURSEMENT- THIS IS LESS EXPENSIVE OUR ALTERNATIVE TO DELIVERY OF COMPARED TO HOSPITAL DELIVERY ESPECIALLY- IF VAGINAL RATHER THAN CESAREAN DELIVERY IS PERFORMED. ON AND REALLY WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE FOR PREGNANT WOMEN IN OUR PROGRAM I DO YOU IDENTIFIED THE TYPES OF A BIRTH THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO EXPERIENCE. IT ALSO DIRECTLY ALIGNS WITH- OUR COMPREHENSIVE QUALITY STRATEGY WHERE WE ARE VERY FOCUSED ON IMPROVING MATERNITY. OUTCOMES ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA YEAH. THE INCLUSION OF A- ERR MED TO- WHAT'S CRITICAL EMERGENCY ERR- TRANSPORTATION PROVIDERS TRANSPORT THE MOST CRITICAL PATIENTS. FROM THE SCENE OF AN INCIDENT AT TWO HOSPITALS AND TRAUMA CENTERS IN ORDER TO ALLOW PROVIDERS TO CONTINUE PROVIDING THESE SERVICES. D. H. THE S. IS PROPOSING TO ELIMINATE THE SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS AND ELIMINATE THE EIGHTY NINETY SEVEN REDUCTION AND INSTEAD PROVIDE A RATE INCREASE FUNDED BY GENERAL FUND AND FEDERAL FUNDS. DO YOU SEE AS HAS PROVIDED- AUGMENTATION AMOUNTS TO SUPPLEMENT THE BASE TRANSPORTATION SERVICES REIMBURSEMENT FUNDED BY PENALTY ASSESSMENTS- FROM CERTAIN VEHICLE CODE AND LOCAL ORDINANCE VIOLATIONS ARE CURRENTLY THE EMERGENCY MEDICAL AIR TRANSPORTATION ACT REQUIRES EXTENSIONS TO THE PROVISIONS- AND AN ANNUAL APPROPRIATION BY THE LEGISLATURE. AND LASTLY WITHIN THE B NINETY SEVEN INCLUSION OF NON EMERGENCY MEDICAL TRANSPORTATION IS A CRITICAL SERVICE ALLOWING FOR BENEFICIARIES TO RECEIVE NEEDED CARE GHC HAS PROVIDED AUGMENTATION AMOUNTS VIA PROP FIFTY SIX SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS. INCLUDING THE OFFSETTING OF AB NINETY SEVEN REDUCTION AMOUNTS TO DH CS IS PROPOSING TO ELIMINATE THE REDUCTION IN PROVIDING ON GOING RATE INCREASE. JUST OF COURT THIS CRITICAL SERVICE. AND WE'RE BUT THE PROP FIFTY SIX PROPOSED. OF PROP FIFTY SIX REVENUES HAVE DECLINED OVER TIME AND ARE SUFFICIENT TO SUPPORT THE CURRENT PROPERTY SIX PER PAYMENTS BEGINNING IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. AND TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE MEDICAL SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT- IN ITS FUNDED BY PROPERTY SIX ARE PROJECTED TO EXCEED REVENUES FIVE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS. THE BUDGET PROPOSES TO FULLY TRANSITION THE FOLLOWING PAYMENTS VALUED AT A HUNDRED AND FORTY SEVEN MILLION. ONGOING RATE INCREASES SUPPORTED BY THE GENERAL FUND BEGINNING JULY ONE OF TWENTY TWO. ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES GREENING'S WORK HE SAYS SCREENING AIDS WAIVER OF SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS. COMMUNITY BASED ADULT SERVICES OR C. BASS SERVICES DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENINGS FREESTANDING PEDIATRIC SUB ACUTE COME HOME HEALTH SERVICES. I CFDT SERVICES NON EMERGENCY MEDICAL TRANSPORTATION IN PEDIATRIC DAY HEALTH CARE SERVICES IN ADDITION THE BUDGET INCLUDES AN INCREASE OF TWENTY NINE MILLION FROM THE GENERAL FUND TO FULLY FUND THE REMAINING PROPERTY SIX PAYMENTS. ARE AT THEIR CURRENT LEVEL IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. AND FINALLY ON THE EQUITY IN PRACTICE TRANSFORMATION PAYMENTS THE DEPARTMENT OF PROPOSES FOUR HUNDRED MILLION TOTAL FUN TWO HUNDRED MILLION GENERAL FUND IN ONE TIME FUNDS TO MAKE EQUITY IN PRACTICE TRANSFORMATION PAYMENTS. TO QUALIFYING MEDICAL PROVIDERS- TO FLOWS CRITICAL OF HEALTH EQUITY GAPS ADDRESS GAPS IN PREVENTIVE MATERNITY AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH MEASURES IN ADDRESS THE GAPS OF CARE THAT AROSE FROM THE- CODE NINETEEN PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. ON SUCH PAYMENTS ARE INTENDED TO PROMOTE PATIENT CENTERED MODELS OF CARE IN PEDIATRIC PRIMARY CARE OBGYN AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SETTINGS INTO ALIGNED WITH THE GOALS OF THE MEDIC HOW COMPREHENSIVE QUALITY STRATEGY- HE'S FUNDS WOULD INCLUDE BOTH INITIAL PLANNING GRANTS AND PRACTICE TRANSFORMATION GRANTS. THE PRACTICE TRANSFORMATION GRANTS WERE IT INCLUDE BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO CHANGE MANAGEMENT OR OTHERS MECHANICS IDENTIFYING AND ADDRESSING UNDER UTILIZATION AND CLOSING CARE GAPS BUT TRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS SYSTEM UPDATES. POPULATION HEALTH IMPROVEMENTS TELEHEALTH REMOTE PATIENT MONITORING AND A VARIETY OF OTHER INITIATIVES TO HELP IMPROVE THE HEALTH OUTCOMES- WE WILL ALSO HELP AND PRACTICES ALIGN THEIR WORK TO ME HOPE THAT WE REALIZE THE BOLD GOALS THAT WE HAVE LAID OUT IN OUR COMPREHENSIVE QUALITY STRATEGY. OF THE APPLICATION AND SELECTION PROCESS WILL ENSURE THAT THE GRANTS ARE DISTRIBUTED ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AS WELL AS WITH THE LENDS TO INVEST IN THE LEAST ADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. AND LASTLY A DH CS IS DEFERRING THE ADDITIONAL PROPERTY SIX FUNDING QUESTIONS IN THE AGENDA TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THIS CONCLUDES MY COMMENTS AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM COREY HOW SHE DOES WITH THE L. L. THANK YOU DR ARAMBULA. SHEET WITH THE L. A. L. REGARDING THE ELIMINATION OF EIGHTEEN NINETY SEVEN PROVIDER RATE REDUCTIONS WE WOULD JUST NOTE THAT DOWN WE DO FIND IT UNCLEAR WHY CERTAIN MEDICARE PROVIDERS ARE PRIORITIZED OVER OTHERS FOR RESTORED RATES IN THIS PROPOSAL- THE LEGISLATURE MAY ALSO WISH TO CONSIDER THE MERITS AND COSTS. OF RESTORING PAYMENT RATES FOR OTHER OR EVEN ALL MEDICAL PROVIDER TYPES THAT REMAIN SUBJECT TO BE THE B. NINETY SEVEN RATE REDUCTIONS- WE ESTIMATE THE ANNUAL COST OF ELIMINATING ALL THE EIGHTY NINETY SEVEN REPRODUCTIONS- A FOR ALL PROVIDERS AT. ROUGHLY TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND- WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE ADMINISTRATION MAY HAVE USE LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE KOBE NINETEEN PANDEMIC TO INFORM THE SELECTION OF PROVIDERS FOR RESTORED RATES- YOU KNOW ACCORDINGLY THE LEGISLATURE MAY WISH TO CONSIDER REQUESTING THE ADMINISTRATION PROVIDE- INFORMATION SUCH AS YOU KNOW THE DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACTS OF COPING NINETEEN ON. THE SELECTED ACCOUNT PROVIDERS RELATIVE TO OTHER PROVIDERS TO SORT OF SUPPORT THIS- THIS RATIONALE- IN ADDITION YOU KNOW WILD MANAGED CARE PLANS MAY NOT ALWAYS TIE THE RATES THAT THEY PAID THEIR PROVIDERS. TO RATES IN THE FEE FOR SERVICE SYSTEM IN MEDIC CAL WE FIND THAT THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL TO. RESTORE RATES WOULD LIKELY AFFECT PAYMENT RATES IN MANAGED CARE AS WELL AS THE PER SERICE- HOWEVER THE PROPOSAL'S COST ESTIMATE ONLY INCLUDES THE COST IMPACT ON THE FEET FOR SERVICE SYSTEM- WHICH WE FIND ME UNDER STATE THAT THE ULTIMATE COSTS. AND THE ADMINISTRATION IS NOTED THAT IT BELIEVES THAT THE MANAGED CARE COSTS FOR THIS PROPOSAL WOULD BE SMALL BUT- THE LEGISLATURE MAY WISH TO REQUEST INFORMATION. JUSTIFYING THIS THIS ASSUMPTION- NEXT TO PROPERTY SIX YOU KNOW WE WOULD JUST NOTE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION'S ASSUME REDUCTION IN PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX REVENUE. IS LARGELY ATTRIBUTED TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SB SEVEN NINETY THREE WHICH IMPLEMENTS A BAN ON SALES OF FLAVORED TOBACCO PRODUCTS- WHICH WOULD RESULT IN FEWER TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING TOBACCO PRODUCTS FOR THE STATE TO TAX- THE ADMINISTRATION ASSUMES THAT THE UPCOMING REFERENDUM FOR VOTER APPROVAL OF SB. SEVEN NINETY THREE WILL SUCCEED ALLOWING THE BAND TO GO FORWARD- SHOULD THIS REFERENDUM FAILED THOUGH- WE WOULD JUST NOTE THAT PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX REVENUES- SHOULD BE SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER THAN ASSUMED WHICH WOULD GREATLY REDUCE THE NEED FOR. GENERAL FUND TO SUPPORT CURRENT- PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX RELATED ITEMS IN IN MEDIC CAL. REGARDING THE EQUITY AND PRACTICE TRANSFORMATION PAYMENTS PROPOSAL YOU KNOW FIRST WE WOULD NOTE THAT WE FIND THIS PROPOSAL APPROPRIATELY TARGETS KEY AREAS OF CONCERN RELATED TO QUALITY IN EQUITY IN MANY CAL WITH ITS FOCUS ON CHILDREN'S PREVENTATIVE SERVICES AND MATERNAL HEALTH- THIS SPECIFIED GOALS SUCH AS IMPROVING CHILDHOOD IMMUNIZATION RATES. ALSO SEEM TO ALIGN WITH THESE AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT- HOWEVER A MORE COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW WOULD BE NEEDED TO SEE IF THIS PURPLE THIS PROPOSAL LEAVES ANY SPECIFIC QUALITY OR OR EQUITY DEFICIENCIES UNADDRESSED IN THE MEDICARE PROGRAM. SECOND ON THIS- ITEM WE WOULD NOTE THAT YOU KNOW WE DO NOT HAVE A SENSE OF THE CURRENT STATE OF CLINICAL INFRASTRUCTURE IN THESE AREAS OF QUALITY IN EQUITY TO DETERMINE WHETHER THIS IS A KEY FIRST STEP IN MEETING THE GOALS OF THIS PROPOSAL- AND THAT YOU KNOW A LONGER ON GOING STRATEGY. INCLUDING THROUGH PROVIDING INCENTIVES FOR- YOU KNOW IMPROVING QUALITY IN EQUITY IN MEDIC HOW WILL BE NECESSARY TO CREATING SUSTAINED IMPROVEMENT IN THIS AREA- LATE LAST YEAR DH CS RELIEF TO RELEASED A DRAFT REPORT OUTLINING A STRATEGY IN THIS REGARD. WHICH WE'VE REVIEWED- WHICH MAY PROVE BENEFICIAL GOING FORWARD- YOU KNOW FINALLY WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE GATHER SOME MORE INFORMATION ON THIS PROPOSAL BEFORE APPROVING- SOME KEY OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS RESOLVED INCLUDE- WHAT KEY QUALITY IN EQUITY GOALS ARE LEFT UNADDRESSED IN SHOULD BE INCORPORATED INTO THIS PROPOSAL- YOU KNOW WHAT IS THE CURRENT. CONDITION OF MEDIC HELP PROVIDERS CLINICAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND WISE CLINICAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND A KEY FIRST STEP TO TAKE WITH THIS PROPOSAL- HOW WILL GRANT APPLICATIONS BE SELECTED AND HOW WILL TEACH THE S. OVERSEE THE ALLOCATION OF THESE FUNDS- AND HOW WILL TEACH THIS DEFEATS THE ESSENCE OTHER EFFORTS TO IMPROVE. MEDICAL PERFORMANCE ON QUALITY IN EQUITY MEASURES CONTRIBUTE TO ONGOING IMPROVEMENTS IN IN THESE AREAS- THOSE ARE ALL OF OUR COMMENTS AT THIS TIME AND WE'RE HAPPY TO BE OF FURTHER ASSISTANCE WHERE NEEDED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I WILL BRING IT. TO THE DIOCESAN BEGIN WITH DOCTOR WITH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND MY QUESTION IS FOR- FOR J. C. COOPER- AND IT IT IT IT ACTUALLY FOLLOWS ALONG THE LINE OF THINKING THAT WE WERE HEARING FROM. MR ISHIDA- I DO HAVE A QUESTION AT WHAT PROVIDER CATEGORIES REMAIN. A SUBJECT OF THE PRODUCT TO THE EIGHTEEN NINETY SEVEN REDUCTION AFTER THIS PROPOSAL. MAN WHO'S LEFT OTHERS ARE. THE LONGLIST STILL- AND WE'D BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO PROVIDE THAT ON TO THE LEGISLATURE TO INDICATE WHERE WE HAVE RESTORED THOSE RATES- AND WE'RE WE STILL HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF SERVICES THAT ARE SUBJECT TO. REDUCTIONS AND I GUESS- IS THE REASON THAT THESE REDUCTIONS ARE NOT BEING PROPOSED FOR ALL PROVIDERS TO ME THE STATE'S IN PRETTY GOOD SHAPE AND THESE GO BACK TO THE LAST RECESSION AND WE'RE SPENDING A WHOLE LOT OF MONEY ON A WHOLE LOT OF THINGS. BUT YOU HAVE MEDICAL PROVIDERS ARE PEOPLE PROVIDING HEALTH CARE THAT FOR YEARS NOW HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO THESE REDUCTIONS- AT WHAT IS THERE A POINT AT WHICH WE CAN GET BEYOND THIS I MEAN. I JUST IT JUST FEELS IT JUST FEELS UNFAIR. UNFAIR YEAH WE HAVE TO TAKE THAT BACK AND ASSESS THE REMAINING- WHEN PUTTING FOR THE PROPOSAL I THINK WE REALLY USE BOTH THE- THE QUALITY STRATEGY IN THE COBIT NINETEEN EXPERIENCE TO REALLY INFORM THIS IMMEDIATE NEED. A GROUP OF PROVIDERS I'M HAPPY TO TAKE THAT BACK FOR ASSESSMENT. I GUESS I WOULD ARGUE THAT ALL THESE PROVIDERS WOULD CONSISTENTLY BE AN IMMEDIATE NEED- THEY'VE BEEN WAITING SINCE TWO THOUSAND NINE I BELIEVE. SO THAT'S A LONG. THANK YOU I THINK A DOCTOR WOULD- I WILL STICK WITH- J. C. COOPER IF I CANNOT I'D LIKE TO TAKE IN ON THE EQUITY PAYMENT PROPOSAL AND I'M HOPING YOU CAN EXPLAIN HOW THE STATE WILL HELP TO HOLD THE PLANS ACCOUNTABLE FOR SHOWING PROGRESS IN EQUITY MEASURES AS A RESULT OF THIS FUNDING. YES REALLY THAT THE INTENTION OF THE FUNDS IS REALLY TO GO AT THE PROVIDER LEVEL- IN MEETING GO TO TALKING TO A NUMBER OF PROVIDER- GROUPS ARE INDIVIDUALS. THAT THERE ARE REAL INVESTMENTS NEEDED TO REALLY BE ABLE TO PROACTIVELY IDENTIFY GAPS OF CARE INCLUDING BEING ABLE TO DISSECT THAT WITH AN EQUITY LENS AND SO WE FELT IT WAS A VERY IMPORTANT TO ENSURE THAT WE WERE PROVIDING A GRANT DOLLARS. YOU ON VARIOUS PROVIDERS TO BE ABLE TO UPDATE THEIR SYSTEMS PROCESSES TO IDENTIFY THOSE GAPS SO THE BE ALTERNATELY CAN BE AT THE LOWEST LEVEL THE DIRECT PROVIDER LEVEL I'M USING DATA TO REALLY INFORM AND DRIVE OTHERS QUALITY IMPROVEMENTS IN OUTCOMES. I MEAN WE DO KNOW THAT SOMETIMES- THAT'S HARD FOR PROVIDER OFFICES YOU- HAVE THAT RISK AND MAKE THOSE INVESTMENTS AND SUPPORT BY PROVIDING THESE GRANTS ARE WE WILL HAVE A SHORT LIST OF MEASURES THAT WE WANT TO SEE A CONTINUE TO INCREASE. IT WOULD ALIGN WITH THE OVERALL BOLD GOALS WE HAVE ANNOUNCED YOUR COMPREHENSIVE QUALITY STRATEGY AND SO REALLY IT'S IN PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR MANAGED CARE PLANS BUT THE INTENT IS REALLY TO GET THESE DOLLARS DIRECTLY TO AN ALL MOST IF NOT ALL OF THE DOLLARS WILL BE GOING DIRECTLY TO. THE PROVIDERS TO FUND A PRACTICE TRANSFORMATION AT THAT INDIVIDUAL PRIMARY CARE OFFICE PEDIATRICIAN OBGYN. OR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROVIDER LEVEL TEETH. YOUR FIFTY BY FIVE BOLD GOAL INITIATIVE. I WOULD BE TO TAG OUR CHIEF QUALITY OFFICER WHO IS ON FOR Q. NA I APOLOGIZE WOULD YOU. PLEASE WALK THROUGH OR GET AN OVERVIEW OF THE BOLD GOALS. EVERYONE ABSOLUTELY- TO THAT FIFTY BY TWENTY FIVE- BLOOD GOALS INITIATIVE WAS REALLY DESIGNED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE SETTING AMBITIOUS BUT ACHIEVABLE TARGETS TO REALLY HELP. THOSE IN OUR MEDICAL POPULATION- WHO'S YOU KNOW CERTAIN QUALITY SCORES THAT WE'VE SEEN LAGGING FOR QUITE SOME TIME SO I'M GONNA JUST READ THROUGH THEM BUT HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS IF THERE ARE ANY. SO BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE WE HOPE TO CLOSE RACIAL AND ETHNIC DISPARITIES AND WELL CHILD VISITS AND IMMUNIZATIONS BY FIFTY PERCENT- BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE WE HOPE TO CLOSE THAT MATERNITY- BUT DISPARITIES THAT WE'RE SEEING SPECIFICALLY FOR BLACK AND NATIVE AMERICAN. BIRTHING INDIVIDUALS BY 50% WE WANT TO IMPROVE MATERNAL AND ADOLESCENT DEPRESSION SCREENING BY 50% GIVEN THE SPECIFIC IMPACT OF MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS ON THOSE TWO POPULATIONS. THAT ARE REALLY AT RISK WE ALSO WANT TO IMPROVE FOLLOW UP- FOR MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS BY 50% THAT SPANS A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT SPECIFIC CORE MEASURES BUT TO HELP REALLY IMPROVE FOLLOW UP FOR. PEOPLE FOR WHO SCREENED POSITIVE FOR DEPRESSION SCREENING OR FOLLOW UP FOR A SUBSTANCE USE DIAGNOSIS AND IT HAD AN EASY SET A MARK BEEN INITIATED ON TREATMENT. AND WE ALSO AT THE LAST GOAL YOU KNOW DOES NOT SOUND OVER HERE WE- AS SPLASHY BUT IS REALLY CRITICAL TO US TO REALLY TACKLE THOSE HEALTH DISPARITIES AND IT IS TO MAKE SURE. THAT EACH AND EVERY HEALTH PLAN ACROSS THE STATE EXCEEDS OUR MINIMUM PERFORMANCE LEVEL WHICH IS THE FIFTIETH PERCENTILE NATIONALLY FOR ALL CHILDREN'S PREVENTIVE CARE MEASURES SO THAT CHILDREN INDEPENDENT OF THE COUNTY THEY LIVE IN OR YOU KNOW WHICH PLAN THEY ARE ASSIGNED TO YOU CAN BE ASSURED. A VERY ROBUST LEVEL OF CARE FOR ALL OF THEIR PREVENTIVE SERVICES. HI THANK YOU FOR THAT- IS THE GOAL OF THE EQUITY PAYMENT PROPOSALS TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN THE FIFTY BY TWENTY FIVE BOLD GOALS AND- IF SO ARE WE- TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE TO THOSE GOALS- AS SET OUT BY THIS BOLD INITIATIVE ANSWER IS YES THE INTENT BEHIND THESE GRANT DOLLARS TO PROVIDERS WOULD BE TO ALLOW FOR PROVIDERS TO DIRECTLY INFLUENCE OUR ABILITY TO IMPROVE THOSE ARE QUALITY OUTCOMES- IN THE DEPARTMENT WILL BE A REPORTING PUBLICLY. ON THOSE OUTCOMES OVER THE COMING YEARS TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE TRACKING IMPROVEMENT IN THOSE AREAS AND IF WE'RE NOT SEEING IMPROVEMENT OF DOING ROOT CAUSE ANALYSES TO IDENTIFY WHY WE'RE NOT SEEING IMPROVEMENTS IN WITH THE NEW STRUCTURE WITH OUR CHIEF QUALITY OFFICER AND OUR QUALITY AND POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT DIVISION. WE ARE VERY FOCUSED ON ATTRACTING THOSE OUTCOMES IN THOSE IMPROVEMENTS. I'D LIKE TO- FOLLOW UP EARLIER YOU HAD SAID THAT THE PAYMENTS WOULD GO TO PROVIDERS. AND YET MY UNDERSTANDING IS IT'S A FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR TOTAL FUND TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR GENERAL FUND. MY UNDERSTANDING IS IT'S COMING WITH A 50% FEDERAL. MATCH BUT WOULDN'T THAT THEN GO THROUGH THE PLANS TO QUALIFY AND- WORK FOR THE 50% FEDERAL MATCH- ARE ARE WE WORKING THROUGH THE PLANS ARE WE WORKING THROUGH THE PROVIDERS. YES SO I WE ARE WORKING THROUGH THE PLANS TO BE ABLE TO DRAW DOWN THE FEDERAL FUNDS LIKE WE'VE DONE IN A HANDFUL OF THESE INITIATIVES I THINK THE BEST EXAMPLE WHERE WE HAVE DONE THIS VERY EFFECTIVELY I'VE PREVIOUSLY. IS THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INTEGRATION GRANTS ARE WE WORKED COLLABORATIVELY WITH OUR MANAGED CARE PLAN OUR PROVIDERS TO DEVELOP ON THE APPLICATION THE PARAMETERS FOR THE GRANT DOLLARS ON THE CRITERIA AND THE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS ARE COLLECTIVELY THREE STAKEHOLDER FEEDBACK AND ENGAGEMENT. THEN WE ROLL OUT A STANDARDIZED- YOU KNOW MODULE AN APPLICATION STATEWIDE THROUGH OUR MANAGED CARE PLANS WHO HAVE THE DIRECT RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE PROVIDERS ALSO REALLY ALLOWS FOR THAT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE LOCALLY I TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TO THOSE PROVIDERS REGARDING THE OPPORTUNITIES AVAILABLE. ON THE DAY THEN I TAKE THE APPLICATIONS FROM THOSE AND USE A DH CS CREATED ON STANDARDIZED CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION OF THOSE GRANTS AND MAKE A RECOMMENDATION TO THE DEPARTMENT AND ULTIMATELY THE DEPARTMENT REVIEWS THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS- SO WE ARE. USING THE MANAGED CARE PLANS AS A CONDIMENT IN LIAISON TO THE LOCAL PROVIDERS OF WHO THEY HAVE RELATIONSHIPS WITHIN THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY OF BUT REALLY THE INTENT IS FOR THOSE DOLLARS I WANT TO BE APPROVED AND THE MANAGED CARE PLANS APPROVED THE APPLICATION. THOSE DOLLARS TO FLOW DIRECTLY. TO THOSE PROVIDERS. FOR QUESTION- THE ADMINS FEE OF. AND MAKING INVESTMENTS INTO COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS TO DRIVE EQUITY PARTICULARLY AS COMPARED TO MAKING BIGGER AND BIGGER INVESTMENTS INTO FOR PROFIT. MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS. HOPING YOU COULD CALL JUST TO BE CLEAR THESE DOLLARS ARE MEANT TO GO DOWNSTREAM TO PROVIDERS- AND SO- THAT'S ONE THING I WOULD NOTE THERE BUT I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS A NUMBER OF ITEMS WITHIN THE BUDGET. THAT ARE FOCUSED ON INCREASING PAYMENTS IN GRANT DOLLARS TO COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS FOR EXAMPLE THE PATH THE DOLLARS THAT WE HAVE WITHIN THE BUDGET PROVIDING ACCESS IN TRANSFORMING HEALTH. IS DIRECTED TOWARDS COUNTIES COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND OTHERS TO MEET THE GOALS OF CAROLINE- AND THERE IS A ONE POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLAR TOTAL FUNDS- I DOLLAR AVAILABLE FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS. AS WELL AS MANY OF THE KALYAN INCENTIVES I CAN GO DOWNSTREAM TO THOSE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THEY ARE CRITICAL PARTNERS. IN REGARDS TO CLOSING EQUITY GAPS AND TRANSFORMATION AS WE MOVE THROUGH AND ENGAGE ALL PROVIDERS ON THE GROUND HOWEVER MANY OF THE MEASURES THAT WERE TALKING ABOUT- DIRECTLY ADMINISTERED BY. A PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS PEDIATRICIANS OBGYN OR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROVIDERS AND SO AS WE ARE TARGETING THOSE INDIVIDUALS CURRENTLY WITH THESE DOLLARS THOSE OF OTHER FUNDS AVAILABLE IN THE BUDGET WOULD BE DIRECTLY- YOU'RE FOCUSED ON I. COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. AMONG OTHER PROVIDERS AS WELL. I WILL- THE ONE FOLLOW UP BY I WILL MENTION THAT- HEALTH EQUITY AND RACIAL JUSTICE FUND WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THE JANUARY BUDGET PROPOSAL AND BELIEVE IT NEEDS TO BE AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE CONVERSATION AS WE GO FORWARD LOOKING TOWARDS EQUITY AND WOULD ASK FOR US TO HAVE CONTINUED CONVERSATIONS AS WE'RE GOING FORWARD. WITHOUT THANK VERY MUCH PANEL EIGHT WE WILL MOVE ON THE PANEL NINE ON THE ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT MODEL PROPOSAL FOR FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS. WE WILL HAVE TO PRESENTERS ON THIS PANEL TRACY COOPER. CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR DH CS AND COREY HOW SHE DEALT ITH THE L. A. L. WE BEGIN WITH CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR COOPER. THANK YOU SO MUCH. ALSO IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN. UNDER SENATE BILL ONE FORTY SEVEN- THE AUTHORIZATION OF A PILOT PROGRAM FOR COUNTY AND COMMUNITY BASED FQHCS WAS ACTED. UNDER THE PROPOSED PILOT A PARTICIPATING FQHCS WOULD MOVE AWAY FROM TRADITIONAL VOLUME BASED PPS PAYMENT SYSTEMS ARE TO ONE THAT BETTER ALIGNS WITH THE INVOLVING FINANCING AND DELIVERY OF HEALTH SERVICES AND CAL. THE PROPOSAL AS PROPOSED UNDER THAT OUR PILOTS- THAT PPS PAYMENT AND WRAPAROUND WOULD BE REPLACED BY AN UP FRONT A CLINICALLY SPECIFIC CAPITATION RATES. ARE THE BENEFITS ADD TO THE PARTICIPATING FQHCS IS THAT THEY WOULD HAVE A SIMPLIFIED PAYMENT PROCESS REPLACING THE PREVIOUS BILLING APPROACH AND ASSOCIATED DELAYS IN PAYMENTS. AT UBC'S WOULD RECEIVE. YOU TO WAIT UNTIL THE END OF THE YEAR FOR SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT WHICH IS PARTICULARLY BENEFICIAL TO CASH STRAPPED HEALTH CENTERS. THIS PAYMENT REFORM BUT ALSO ALLOW IF YOU SEE THE ABILITY TO OPERATE MORE EFFICIENTLY- AND DELIVER CARE IN INNOVATIVE WAYS THAT WILL REALLY EXPAND BEYOND- OR EXPAND OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE PRIMARY AND SPECIALTY CARE ACCESS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. OF FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU WHICH THESE WOULD PROVIDE NONTRADITIONAL SERVICES NOT CURRENTLY REIMBURSED UNDER THE TRADITIONAL VOLUME BASED PPS I'M INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO GROUP IT SETS AN EMAIL VISITS PHONE VISITS A COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKER- OF CONTACTS CASE MANAGEMENT. A CARE COORDINATION ACROSS SYSTEMS ADDITIONALLY OF THE REFORM REMOVES INCENTIVES TO INCREASE THE VOLUME OF SEPARATE VISITS ON THIS PROPOSED PILOT- WAS ALSO EXPECTED TO INCREASE COLLABORATION BETWEEN THE MANAGED CARE PLANS- AND THE PARTICIPATING FQHCS. ABOUT BOTH WOULD HAVE ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS BOTH WOULD ALSO EXPERIENCE INCREASED VALUE FROM BETTER COORDINATION CARE- THEREBY HELPING TO REDUCE UNNECESSARY UTILIZATION OF SERVICES AND IMPROVE BENEFITS YOUR EXPERIENCE. AND HEALTH OUTCOMES. HOWEVER GFCIS WAS UNABLE TO IMPLEMENT THE PILOT AS OUTLINED BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN DUE TO AN- TO RECEIVE FEDERAL APPROVAL BASED ON STATUTORY TRIGGERS FOR RECONCILIATION TO INSURE FQHCS WERE REIMBURSED AT LEAST THE PPS RATE. OF OUR THE REVISED DH CS PROPOSAL WHICH IS PROPOSED IN THIS BUDGET- UPDATES EXISTING LAW THAT AUTHORIZES THE DEPARTMENT IMPLEMENTED ALTERNATE PAYMENT MODELS- REIMBURSEMENT METHODOLOGY FOR FQHCS NO SOONER THAN JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. THE PROPOSAL MAKES- THE FOLLOWING CHANGES TO THE EXISTING AUTHORITY CHANGES THE APM FROM UP HIGH LEADS TO AN ONGOING REIMBURSEMENT MECHANISM. MODIFIES LANGUAGE WHICH TRIGGERS RECONCILIATION TO BE ACTUAL UTILIZATION COMPARED. TO YOU PROJECTED UTILIZATION AND AS LANGUAGE TO ESTÁ BY AND ACCESS DANDER. AND IF THE PARTICIPATING ATHLETES HE DOES NOT MOVE THE ESTABLISH. ARE THE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO RETURN A PORTION OF THE P. M. P. M. REVENUE WHILE ENSURING REVENUE RECEIVED WILL NOT BE LOWER THAN THE AMOUNT THAT WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE BEEN RECEIVED UNDER THE TRADITIONAL PPS REIMBURSEMENT.

WE NEEDED TO SUPPORT THE PROGRAM SUCCESSFUL LAUNCH IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR- WE WOULD NOTE I'D ADD THIS WILL REQUIRE TRAILER BILL AS MENTIONED AND IDENTIFIED AND WE ARE HOPING TO RELEASE THAT TRAILER BILL AS SOON. AS POSSIBLE THIS CONCLUDES MY COMMENT. NEXT WE WILL HEAR FOR KOREA HOW SHE'D I WITH THE L. THANK DOCTOR REGULATORY WITH THE L. A. L.

THE TRUCK THAT CHILDREN'S PRESUMPTIVE LG PROGRAM WILL EXPAND TO ALL APPLICABLE MEDIC HELP PROVIDERS WHEREAS THE CURRENT PROGRAM IS ONLY FOR CHD P. PROVIDERS. THEREBY PERMITTING MORE PROVIDERS TO MAKE PRESUMPTIVE ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATIONS AND EXPANDING ACCESS TO MEDICAL SERVICES FOR MORE CHILDREN IN USE. ALLOWING ALL APPLICABLE MEDICAL PROVIDERS TO DETERMINE A PRESUMPTIVE ELIGIBILITY WILL PROVIDE IMMEDIATE COVERAGE TO MORE CHILDREN NOT YET ENROLLED IN MEDI CAL OR WHO WERE PREVIOUSLY DISTANT ROLLED HER DROPPED FROM MEDIC HELL.

AS A PART OF ITS FULL PROPOSAL DEVELOPED A DETAILED ON CCP PROGRAM RESPONSIBILITY CROSSWALK WHICH INCLUDES A COMPLETE AND DETAILED LIST OF ALL EXISTING CHP REQUIREMENTS CROSSWALK WITH THE ACS PROPOSED. OUTCOMES IN TRANSITION SAN DIEGO CS IS WORKING FORWARD RELEASE THIS BOOK IS AS- SO THE LEAD. IN AND NOW DO THE IN OUR ON THE CROSS OF ALL. REGARDING THE ESTIMATED PERCENTAGE OF CHILDREN ELIGIBLE- ARE MEDICARE ELIGIBLE CHILDREN WHO ARE NOT ENROLLED IN MEDICAID HOW THERE'S A QUESTION IN THE GENDER REGARDING THIS IDEA YES DOES NOT COLLECT. THESE DATA ELEMENTS IN GENERAL MEETING THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE ARE THAT ARE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE BUT NOT ENROLLED IS CHALLENGING THING FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO DO. A TYPICALLY THESE TYPES OF PROJECTIONS INVOLVE LOOKING AT SURVEY DATA ON DEVELOPING PROJECTIONS IN MOST OFTEN DONE BY RESEARCHERS I'M MUCH OF ONE SUCH EXTERNAL RESEARCH STUDY DONE BY THE URBAN INSTITUTE INDICATES THAT. ARE ABOUT NINETY FOUR POINT 6% OF ELIGIBLE CHILDREN ARE ENROLLED IN MEDICAID HOW- WE HOPE TO RELEASES TRAILER BILL AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND THIS. REMAINS ARE MY COMMENTS AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF WILL BRING IT UP TO THE DAY FOR ANY QUESTIONS. I WILL KEEP IT HERE THE CHAIR RIGHT I WANTED TO BRING UP SOME- RECENTLY RECEIVED COUNTY CONCERNS THAT WE- HAD REGARDING THIS PROPOSAL. PARTICULARLY RELATED TO THE ELIMINATION OF THE C. H. T. P. WILL HAVE ON DENTAL CARE. CURRENTLY PROVIDED THROUGH THE C. H. T. P. CAN YOU PLEASE DESCRIBE THE IMPACT AND ASSURE THAT NO SERVICES FOR CHILDREN. WILL BE LOST AS A RESULT OF THIS PROPOSAL. S. THANK YOU FOR THAT- QUESTION AS THOUGH OUR MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS ARE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE REFERRALS FOR DENTAL SERVICES WE ALSO- REQUIRED THAT OUR DENTAL MANAGED CARE PLANS AND THROUGH DENTAL FEE FOR SERVICE S. B. PER SERVICE ORCHESTRA INTERMEDIARY. ARE ACTIVELY ENGAGING WITH INDIVIDUALS IN REGARDS TO NEEDED DENTAL SERVICES- AND ADDS MENTION BUT THE MAJORITY IF NOT ALL CHILDREN TRANSITIONING TO A MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS- WE% DO SEE THIS AS DUPLICATIVE ASCENTS CHILDREN WILL NOT BE IN VIEW FOR SERVICE- IN THE FUTURE- MAJORITY MOVING TO MANAGED CARE. WHICH IS REALLY AROUND STREAMLINING OUR SYSTEMS AND ENSURING BUT REALLY MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE HOLDING OUR PLANS. AND OUR DENTAL PRODUCTS YOU KNOW MANAGED CARE PLANS AND DENTAL FEE FOR SERVICE PROVIDERS- AND ADVOCATES FOR ALSO INSURING REFERRALS TO DENTAL SERVICES. CURRENTLY ARE. CHD PROGRAMS. IN A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF OUTREACH AND- MARKETING TO HELP TO BRING FAMILIES INTO THE PROGRAM. UNDER THIS PROPOSAL PRESUMPTIVE ELIGIBILITY ONLY OCCURS AS A PERSON IS ALREADY IN THE CARE OF A PROVIDER. AND I'M WANTING TO ASK HOW DOES DH CS PLAN TO ADDRESS THIS GAP AN OUTREACH- SO I ONE THING I WOULD SAY IS THAT RIGHT NOW IT'S VERY LIMITED PROGRAM IT'S ONLY FOUR CHD P. PROVIDERS WHO CAN DO THAT PRESUMPTIVE ELIGIBILITY A GATEWAY SCREENING WHICH IS VERY FEW A NUMBER OF PROVIDERS AND- IF MY TEAM CAN SEND ME THAT THE NUMBER THAT WOULD BE REALLY GREAT- WE ARE. PROPOSING TO EXPAND ON THE CHILDREN PRESUMPTIVE ELIGIBILITY TO ALL MEDICAL PROVIDERS WHO ARE WILLING TO YOU KNOW MEET THE NEEDS- THE EXPECTATIONS OF PRESUMPTIVE ELIGIBILITY WHICH IS NOT DIFFICULT A HUGE NUMBER- PARTICIPATE IN OUR HOSPITAL PRESUMPTIVE ELIGIBILITY PROGRAM FOR EXAMPLE BUT THE PROGRAMS JUST TO NARROW WE'RE NOT HITTING ALL OF THE CHILDREN IN REGARDS TO PRESUMPTIVE ELIGIBILITY. SO WE THINK BY EXPANDING TO ALL MEDICARE OUT OF PROVIDERS TO DO PRESUMPTIVE ELIGIBILITY WE WILL BE ABLE TO CATCH A LARGER NUMBER OF CHILDREN AND YOUTH WHO NEED TO BE ENROLLED INTO MEDIC CAL- IN BE BROADLY WORK ACROSS ALL AREAS ADVOCATES ARE WORKING TO HELP COLLECTIVELY INFORM. INDIVIDUALS OF THEIR RIGHTS TO HAVE MEDICAL SERVICES ON IN SO REALLY WE DO THINK THIS WILL GREATLY BENEFIT CHILDREN'S AND YOUTH ACCESS TO MEDICAL SERVICES MY TEAM IS JOHNNY ON THE SPOT I'M IN THERE ARE ONLY TWO THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTEEN ACTIVE OF PROVIDERS PARTICIPATING IN THE C. H. T. P. EIGHT M. GATEWAY PROGRAM. AND WE HAVE A YOUNG TENS OF THOUSANDS OF MEDICAL PROVIDERS WHO COULD HELP US ACCESS MORE CHILDREN IN GET INCREASED IN ROAMING pYOUTH AND SO WE DO THINK THIS IS A VERY POSITIVE. PROPOSAL UP FOR CONSIDERATION. WE WILL. UP WE CAN- PUBLIC WHERE WE WERE ASKED OUR QUESTION AND WITH THAT WE WILL THANK VERY MUCH PANEL TEN. AND MOVE ON THE PANEL ELEVEN ON THE REDUCTIONS TO MEDICAL PREMIUMS AND COPAYMENTS. WE WILL HAVE TO PRESENTERS ON THIS PANEL BEGINNING WITH CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR JC COOPER WITH DH CS. FOLLOWED BY LUKE KASH MORROW WITH THE L. A. O. LET US BEGIN WITH CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR COOPER. THANK YOU ALL REGARDING THE REDUCTION TO PREMIUMS TO ZERO DOLLARS THE BUDGET REQUEST OF FIFTY THREE POINT TWO MILLION TOTAL FUNDS. IN THE BUDGET YEAR AND EIGHTY NINE MILLION TOTAL FUND ON GOING TO REDUCE THE PREMIUMS OF OUR PREGNANT INDIVIDUALS CHILDREN AND WORKING DISABLED PROGRAMS TO ZERO DOLLARS EFFECTIVE JULY ONE OF TWENTY TWO- THIS PROPOSAL COVERS ALL MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES CURRENTLY OPINION PAYING PREMIUMS AND COPAYMENTS. ARE THE THIS AT A PREMIUM REQUIREMENT PLACES AN UNDUE ECONOMIC BURDEN ON INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES THAT. ARE ALREADY LIVING ON LIMITED INCOMES- AND ARE RESTRICTED- IN THE PURSUIT OF SUBSTANTIAL- A GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT DUE TO A DISABILITY- MONTHLY PREMIUM PAYMENT REQUIREMENTS CREATE BARRIERS IN ACCESS TO CARE. AND CAN LEAD TO UNNECESSARY BREAKS IN COVERAGE FOR ELIGIBLE. INDIVIDUALS THE POPULATIONS INCLUDED IN THIS PREMIUM- REDUCTIONS ZERO UNGLUED THE OPTIONAL TARGET LOW INCOME CHILDREN PROGRAM- PREMIUMS ARE IMPOSED FOR EACH ELIGIBLE CHILDREN UNDER NINETEEN YEARS OF AGE WHOSE FAMILY INCOME IS DETERMINED TO BE ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SIXTY PERCENT. INTERRUPTS YOU INCLUDING A HUNDRED AND 66% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL IT ALSO INCLUDES THE GEORGIAN 50% WORKING DISABLED PROGRAM PREMIUMS AREN'T PROS FOR WORKING DISABLED INDIVIDUALS WHOSE INCOME IS DETERMINED TO BE UP TO AND INCLUDING TWO HUNDRED FIFTY PERCENT. OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL ON INCLUDES THE CHILDREN HELP THAT ADDITIONAL PROGRAMS ARE CHIP PROGRAMS ARE PREMIUMS ARE IMPOSED FOR CHILDREN UNDER NINETEEN YEARS OF AGE WHOSE FAMILY INCOME IS ABOVE. 162% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL AND INCLUDING THREE HUNDRED AND 22% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL THIS PROGRAM COVERS CHILDREN IN SAN FRANCISCO SAN MATEO AND SANTA CLARA COUNTIES. WE ALSO INCLUDED THE MEDI CAL ACCESS PROGRAM OR- AND CAPPED A PREMIUMS ARE IMPOSED FOR PREGNANT INDIVIDUALS WITH HOUSEHOLD INCOMES ABOUT A HUNDRED THIRTY. 113% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL BUT NOT TO EXCEED AT THREE HUNDRED TWENTY TWO PERCENT. AND LASTLY THE MEDICARE ACCESS AND THE PROGRAM INFANTS BORN INTO THE EMPOWER PROGRAM- ENROLLED INDIVIDUALS- ARE ELIGIBLE FOR THAT PROGRAM. IN REGARDS TO THE REDUCTION OF COPAYMENTS TO USE ZERO DOLLARS OF THE BUDGET ADVANCES A PROPOSAL TO REDUCE ALL COPAYMENTS IN THE MEDICARE PROGRAM TWO ZERO DOLLARS AFTER JULY ONE OF TWENTY TWO. TO BRING THE DEPARTMENT- INTO COMPLIANCE WITH FEDERAL REGULATIONS I'M ALL INDIVIDUALS ENROLLED IN MEDICARE FEE FOR SERVICE ARE SUBJECT TO NOMINAL COPAYMENTS WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE FOLLOWING FOSTER CHILDREN PREGNANT INDIVIDUALS AND CHILDREN UNDER. THE YEARS OF AGE OF NINETEEN. I EXISTING LAW REQUIRES MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES. WITH SOME EXCEPTIONS TO PAY AN ARM ON ALL NON INFO. COPAYMENT FOR COME SERVICES. MEDICARE BENEFITS MAY BE CHOI BY- IN THE PROVIDER RETAINS THE COPAYMENT WHEN SERVICES ARE RENDERED A CO MAKE A CO PAYMENTS ARE NOT PASSED TO THE DEPARTMENT. OF THE DEPARTMENT IS SEEKING TO REDUCE COPAYMENTS- IN THE MEDICARE PROGRAM TWO ZERO- IN AN EFFORT TO REMOVE ANY POTENTIAL BARRIERS TO ACCESS TO CARE IN TO AVOID COSTLY SYSTEM CHANGES OTHERWISE NEEDED TO COME INTO COMPLIANCE WITH FEDERAL REGULATIONS. ARE CURRENTLY PROVIDERS MAY NOT DENY CARE TO BENEFICIARIES UNABLE TO PAY COPAYMENTS- AT THIS TIME AT THE TIME OF THE APPOINTMENT MEANING THERE'S LITTLE RATIONALE FOR MAINTAINING THE NOMINAL NON ENFORCEABLE. REQUIREMENTS FOR CO PAYMENTS AT THE STATE DOES NOT RECEIVE ANY REVENUE BASED ON THE COLLECTION OF COPAYMENTS AS MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY. FINALLY OUR CHANGES TO VERY SYSTEMS TO EFFECTUATE THE TRACKING OF COPAYMENTS WOULD OF PRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT COST ARE THERE FOR DH CS ARE DETERMINED IT WOULD NOT BE COST EFFECTIVE OR BENEFICIAL TO BUILD A SYSTEM TO TRACK COPAYMENTS. REDUCING COPAYMENTS WHAT ARE WHAT ALLEVIATE THE NEED FOR THE TRACKING SYSTEM TO COMPLY WITH FEDERAL REGULATIONS- THAT IS. THE CONCLUSION OF MY COMMENTS AT THIS TIME. NEXT TO HEAR FROM THE L. L. THANK YOU AND WE WILL BE PROVIDING A MORE DETAILED ASSESSMENT OPINION PRO IS ALL IN THE COMING WEEKS ASPART OF A PUBLICATION ON HEALTHCARE ACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY- ON HOW WE DO ONE OR TWO ISSUES THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER REGARDING THE PROPOSAL FIRST THE MINISTRATIONS BEST COSTUME TO NOT ASSUME THAT THERE IS A CASE OF INCREASED. AS A RESULT OF THE PREMIUM REDUCTIONS. AND THEY'VE NOTED THAT THEY SEEM THE IMPACT WOULD BE RELATIVELY MINOR DIFFICULT ESTIMATE I WOULD BASED ON THE NUMBER OF STUDIES WE REVIEWED WE THINK THAT WE WERE USING THE PREMIUMS WOULD LIKELY RESULT IN AT LEAST SOME AMOUNT OF INCREASE ENROLLMENT WELL THERE IS CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY. NEW ENROLLMENT I TOLD REDUCING PREMIUMS AT ZERO COULD RESULT IN INCREASED GENERAL FUND COSTS THAT COULD POTENTIALLY IN THE TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. OR HIGHER IN GENERAL FUND COSTS. IN BECAUSE ALSO TO GET. ON ARE ROLE FROM THE PRO. AND LET PAY. YOU IS YOUR FOR THEIR- ABLE TO REGIONAL. POLITICAL WANT TO ASK THE MINISTER HOW THIS POLICY IMPACT THESE HOUSE. FOR EXAMPLE A PREMIUM ARE REDUCED ZERO WHEN THESE. DON'T NEED TO PAY BACK ANY PAST IN PREMIUMS. ON BEFORE THEY CAN RECALL IN MEDICARE. OVERALL WE DO RECOMMEND TO APPROVE THIS PROPOSAL I WILL BE FORGIVEN SO WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE REQUEST AT THIS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. FROM THE MINISTRATION. BUT THE TRUMP OF THE RIGHT. FROM INCLUDING FOR KESSLER. IMPACT AND MICHELIN POP POLICY WOULD HAVE FAMILIES GOT PAST DUE TO. ENTER OF THAT COOKING TVS WE ARE REVIEWING BILLING- DID NOT COMMENT AT THIS TIME THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'LL BRING IT UP TO THE DIE WILL BEGIN WITH DOCTOR. THANK YOU EFFORT PRESENTATION AND IS JUST A QUESTION I GUESS- WE'RE LOOKING AT IN THE CONTEXT OF AFFORDABILITY- ONE OF THE PROPOSALS IS BEING ADDRESSED- IS ADDRESSING THE SHOW- MEDICAL SHARE COST- I. AM I'M CURIOUS ABOUT THE MAINTENANCE NEED INCOME LEVEL I BELIEVE THIS AMOUNT HASN'T BEEN ADJUTED AND SINCE THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES AND I BELIEVE DOCTOR REGULAR HAS A BILL AND- INTRODUCED ON THIS TOPIC- IF WE'RE TRYING TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE. GET HEALTH CARE SOONER- YET THEY'RE STILL REQUIRED TO SPEND DOWN TO THIS MAINTENANCE INCOME LEVEL- NEED INCOME LEVEL THAT HASN'T BEEN ADJUSTED FOR PROBABLY FORTY YEARS- CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHY THIS WASN'T PROPOSED A I. THE GOAL IS TO GET GOOD HEALTH ANCHOR AT OUTCOMES FOR PEOPLE AND HERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT SO WHAT AM I MISSING. THIS IS FOR ME PRINCE MISTER FOR NOT FOR THE LA OFFICE SO. I THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR QUESTION I THINK YOU KNOW AS WE EVALUATED A NUMBER OF AREAS- ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY IN THE WAVING OF PREMIUMS WHERE WE ZEROED IN IN REGARDS TO PROPOSING. ARE THE ELIMINATION OF PREMIUMS ARE MOVING FORWARD- I THINK I WOULD ALSO JUST SAY BE DEFINITELY. KNOWLEDGE YOUR COMMENTS REGARDING A MAINTENANCE NEED IT'S CURRENTLY NOT A PART OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL BUT ACKNOWLEDGED THAT IT IS ANOTHER AREA. OF FOCUS. LET ME JUST POINT I MEAN WE'RE DEALING WITH THESE ARE THIS IS DEALING WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE DISABLED. OR FOR PERSONS OVER THE AGE OF SIXTY FIVE SO THESE ARE THESE ARE YOU KNOW MORE VULNERABLE POPULATIONS AND SO- TECHNICALLY POSSIBLY HAVE A GREATER NEED FOR HEALTH CARE SO IT I'M SORRY DOES THAT PART DOESN'T MAKE SENSE I HOPE THAT WE COULD CONSIDER AN ADJUSTMENT TO THAT IN THE FUTURE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. I WILL FOLLOW UP ON ONE QUESTION FOR THE DEPARTMENT- REGARDING THE COPAYMENTS- THERE WAS A- DEPARTMENTAL FACT SHEET FROM DH CS. I WAS HOPING TO UNDERSTAND THE RATIONALE FOR QUOTE UNLESS REINSTATED FOR ANY IMPACTED STATE FISCAL YEAR END QUOTE. IF THE COPAYMENTS GO TO PROVIDERS AS YOU MENTIONED AND NOT TOWARDS DH CS. WHY WOULD IT MATTER WHAT THE STATE FISCAL YEAR IS LIKE. I THINK THAT'S JUST- I YOU KNOW ENSURING THAT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THE LANGUAGE IS NOT ELIMINATING COPAYMENTS IT'S RESERVE REDUCING THE COPAYMENT DOLLAR AMOUNTS TO ZERO I'M SO IF AND WHEN OR IF IN THE FUTURE THERE IS A NEED TO RE INSTITUTE COPAYMENTS. ARE THAT THAT WOULD BE ALLOWABLE UNDER STATE STATUTE. THANK THE ONLY POINT I'M TRYING TO REITERATE IS THE ONE YOU MADE TO US WHICH IS THE STATE DOESN'T RECEIVE BENEFIT FROM THESE. COPAYMENTS AND SO WIDE IS OUR FISCAL CONDITION FOR THE STATE MATTER AND THUS WHY ARE WE USING THAT SPECIFIC LANGUAGE IS. THE ORIGIN OF THE QUESTION HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP MCCARTY TO. YEAH I KNOW I- I THINK RIGHT NOW- I THINK THAT MAJORITY OF OUR COPAYMENTS OR DOLLAR FIVE FOR EXAMPLE- BUT IN THE FUTURE IF THEIR WORD TO BE A SIGNIFICANT DOWNTURN IN THE ECONOMY. OR OTHER ON DECISIONS THAT PEOPLE NEEDED TO MAKE YOU COULD PROPOSE A HIGHER COPAYMENT ON THAT MAY BE MORE IMPACTFUL BUT CURRENTLY IT IS NOT IMPACTFUL FROM A BUDGETARY PERSPECTIVE. AGAIN WOULD NOTE THOUGH IF WE WERE TO DO THAT IT WOULD REQUIRE ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS IN REGARDS TO COSTS AND SYSTEMS TO COME INTO COMPLIANCE WITH THE FEDERAL REGULATIONS- AS WELL SO IT WOULD BE COSTLY- I TAKE TO IMPLEMENT IN THE FUTURE AND SO AT THIS TIME. ARE RECOMMENDING BRINGING THOSE DOWN TO ZERO AND THE KNOWLEDGE IN YOUR COMMENTS COMPLETELY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THIRD PANEL NUMBER ELEVEN WE WILL MOVE ON THE PANEL TWELVE ON THE HEARING AID COVERAGE. FOR CHILDREN PROGRAM WE WILL HAVE A CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR J. C. COOPER FROM DH CS BEGIN. CAN WE BEGIN- CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR COOPER.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH I WILL BRING IT BACK UP TO THE DIET AND SEE IF THERE ARE ANY NUMBER OF QUESTIONS I WILL- KEEP. IT WITH THE CHAIR- I'M GONNA BE- BY TRYING TO AND- OUR PLAN TO BOTH INCREASE CHILD ENROLLMENT AND PARTICIPATION. AND HOW WE CAN HELP TO SUPPORT TIMELY ACCESS TO APPROPRIATE PEDIATRIC CARE. HAS ITS APPARENT FROM THE ENROLLMENTS WE'VE SEEN SO FAR THAT THERE. ARE IMPROVEMENTS THAT CAN BE MADE AND I'M HOPING THE DEPARTMENT CAN- SHARE WITH US PLANS GOING FORWARD. YES SO I'M GOING TO TURN IT OVER TO A ROOMMATE AT RENEE MAILLOUX WHO CAN ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS REGARDING THE PROGRAM. SO SORRY ABOUT THAT. HELLO AND MEMBERS FOR NAY MODEL DEPUTY DIRECTOR HEALTHCARE BENEFITS AND ELIGIBILITY SO AS WE NEED TO WORK WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS AND AS WE HEAR ABOUT I'M CURIOUS HAVE INTEREST OR OUR CONSIDERATION PARTNERS PROGRAM WE DO TAKE THAT UNDER ADVISEMENT- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING VERY DILIGENTLY TO DO HERE IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE SERVICES AND SUPPORTS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO THE CHILDREN UNDER THE MEDICAID HEALTH PROGRAM FOR EQUALLY AVAILABLE TO THE CHILDREN THAT ARE INVOLVED IN THIS PROGRAM. SO WE DO MAINTAIN REGULAR COMMUNICATIONS WHAT STAKEHOLDERS- WE DID HAVE A DEDICATED STAKEHOLDER WORKGROUP I HAVE TRANSITION THAT OVER TO OUR CONSUMER FOCUS OF WORKGROUP WHERE THERE IS TIME ON THE AGENDA TO HEAR ABOUT CONCERNS OF THE ADVOCATES AND THEN TO TAKE THAT INFORMATION BACK AND THEN TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE PROGRAM. AREAS WHERE WE CAN DO- ON IMPROVEMENTS IN SAY THE APPLICATION PROCESS WE DO OF ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS IN THAT PROCESS SO IT'S AN ONGOING PROCESS AN EVOLUTION WITH THIS PROGRAM AND WE WILL AND WE DO REMAIN COMMITTED IN TERMS OF WORKING WITH OUR STATE LOCAL PARK AT PARTNERS IN THE DEVELOPMENT AND MAINTENANCE OF THIS PROPER. THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND I WOULD JUST HIGHLIGHTED ON PAGE FIFTY SEVEN OF THE AGENDA AT THE VERY TOP IS A STAKEHOLDER RECOMMENDATION- TO APPLY THE MEDIKAL AND CCS STANDARDS FOR TIMELY ACCESS TO SERVICES THE PRESUMPTIVE COVERAGE. DURING APPLICATION REVIEW TO AVOID DELAYS IN CHILDREN RECEIVING HEARING AIDS- IS THERE A WAY WE CAN- IT SHOULD SHOULDN'T WE BASED ON YOUR LOGIC ALSO BE APPLYING THAT TO THE- HACCP PROGRAM. DO YOU WANT ME TO GO. I WAS A GOOD DAY I JUST WANT TO REINFORCE THAT WE DO APPLY THOSE CCS STANDARDS TOO I'M TO THE REVIEW TODAY BUT BY ALL MEANS RENEE AT ANY ADDITIONAL DETAIL. I YOU KNOW I WAS GONNA SAY THE SAME THING AND- WE CAN TAKE BACK- UNDER CONSIDERATION THE PRESUMPTIVE ELIGIBILITY IT IS NOT A COMPONENT PART OF THIS PROGRAM AND BECAUSE IT'S NOT A MEDICAID PROGRAM SO THERE ARE CONSIDERATIONS THAT WE HAVE TO LOOK AT IN TRYING TO LEVERAGE- PRESUMPTIVE ELIGIBILITY AND THE PATHWAYS THAT WE NEED. AB FOR INDIVIDUALS IN THE- WOULD LOVE TO FOR UP WHETHER OR NOT IT'S POSSIBLE FOR YOU TO DO THAT WITH AND REGULATIONS OR WHETHER OR NOT YOU WILL NEED A FOLLOW UP- BILL FOR US. TO WORK ON- BUT- FURTHER DOWN WITHIN THE STAKEHOLDER RECOMMENDATIONS IS- AN IDEA TO CODIFY THE- HEARING AID COVERAGE FOR CHILDREN PROGRAM INTO STATE STATUTE AND- AM WONDERING WHY THIS. WAS NOT DONE THUS FAR. SO YOU KNOW AGAIN THE PROPOSAL WAS ONE IN TERMS OF THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE PROGRAM I THINK WHAT PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR ARE SOME ADDITIONAL- PROVISIONS AROUND THAT COVERAGE OPTIONS OF THE PROGRAM BUT WE DO PUBLISHED THAT PROGRAM POLICIES AND PROCEDURES. AND HARM MEDICAL PROVIDER MANUAL AND THAT MANUAL AND THOSE DATES ARE SHARED BROADLY WITH THE STAKEHOLDER WORKGROUPS. AND WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS AND IT DOES OFFER THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO WAIT IN ENFORCEABLE MAKE MODIFICTIONS THAT THAT ARE APPROPRIATE BASED. UPON THE STRUCTURE OF THIS PROGRAM. I'D LIKE TO- THAT WILL CONCLUDE MY QUESTIONS BUT I WOULD LIKE TO REQUEST A COST ESTIMATE. FROM THE ADMINISTRATION ON RAISING THE REIMBURSEMENT RATES FOR BOTH THIS PROGRAM AND THE MEDICARE PROGRAM TO MATCH THE RATES WITHIN THE CCS PROGRAM FOR HEARING AIDS. AND ANY SERVICES OFFERED THROUGH THE HACCP AND I'M HOPING YOU CAN GET US THAT INFORMATION WHEN AVAILABLE- WE'LL BE HAPPY TO LOOK THE ANALYSIS I THINK WE'LL- ENGAGE WITH YOUR YOUR TEAM MEMBERS I'M OUTSIDE OF THE HEARING TO UNDERSTAND OF WITH THE PROPOSED RATE INCREASE WOULD BE I WOULD JUST THINK KNOWLEDGE THAT- AUDIO- ART AUDIOLOGY SERVICES IN HEARING AIDS WAS INCLUDED IN THE EIGHTY NINETY SEVEN. OF PROPOSAL MENTIONED EARLIER IN REGARDS TO ELIMINATING THAT REDUCTION- BUT WE WILL ENGAGE WITH YOUR TEAMS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND YOUR RECOMMENDATION.

PROGRAM I KNOW TRAILER BILL IS NEEDED FOR THIS PROPOSAL- AND- REGARDING AS- THE PROPOSING OF A ONE TIME RATHER THAN ONGOING PH YES WILL DEFER TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE REGARDING THAT QUESTION. IN THIS CONCLUDES MY COMMENTS AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE WILL BEGIN WITH ASSEMBLYMEMBER RAMIS. THANK YOU SO MUCH- MISTER CHAIRMAN THE FIRST I WANT TO THANK THE TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS- LIMITED TERM OR ONE YEAR- MONEY THIS BEING PROVOKED PROPOSED BUT- I ALSO HAVE TO BRING ATTENTION TO- DURING THE COLD AT A PANDEMIC THAT WE'RE CONTINUING TO GO THROUGH- UNDERLYING CONDITIONS STILL SUFFER AT A HIGHER RATE- THE AMERICAN INDIAN POPULATION HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND I WOULD BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T BRING UP THE STATE INDIAN HEALTH PROGRAMS- THAT WAS ESTABLISHED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE THAT THERE WAS ONGOING FUNDING FOR THEM UP UNTIL TWO THOUSAND AND NINE. SO TWO THOUSAND AND NINE THE ONGOING FUNDING STOPPED BUT WE ALSO SEE NOW THE PANDEMIC THAT IS CONTINUE TO GO THROUGH THAT THE CALIFORNIA INDIAN PEOPLE STILL SUFFER MAJOR UNDERLYING CONDITIONS. AND SO WHEN WE SEE THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT ADDING TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS- ONE TIME FUNDING THE QUESTION IS IF WE WANT TO CAPTURE THE ONGOING FUNDING TO NOT TAKE IT AWAY IN TWO THOUSAND NINE WHAT WE SEE THAT HIGH POPULATION OF UNDERLYING CONDITIONS AND MANY- CALIFORNIA PEOPLE NAY AMERICAN PEOPLE HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- SUCCUMBED TO THE COLD AT. EPIDEMIC HIGHER THAN ANY OTHER GROUP OUT THERE WHEN YOU START TO LOOK AT THE DATA AND STATISTICS THAT ARE THERE. SO ARE WE TO LOOK AT A ONE TIME FUNDING ARE WE TRULY GONNA START TO DISCUSS THE ONGOING FUNDING OF THE HEALTH CARE OF CALIFORNIA'S FIRST PEOPLE. MYSELF I'VE PUT FORWARD- THE COST OF A TWENTY THREE MILLION DOLLAR ONGOING FUNDING. HOWEVER I WOULD LIKE TO DISCUSS WHAT IS THAT AMOUNT MOVING FORWARD I BELIEVE THERE HAS TO BE ONGOING FUNDING THAT SOME COMPONENTS SOME MEASUREMENT SO THAT WE DON'T GET INTO A POSITION TO WHERE THE DATA IN THE STATISTICS ARE BEING READ IN THIS COMMITTEE HEARING BY THOSE ON THE ZOOM IN PRESENTERS THAT CONTINUE TO SAY. THAT THE CALIFORNIA PEOPLE SUFFER HIGHER AREAS OF SUICIDE HIGHER AREAS OF DIABETES HIGHER AREAS UNDERLYING CONDITIONS I WOULD IMAGINE THAT THOSE WERE THE SAME STATISTICS THAT WERE READ BACK IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE THAT IS STAB WISH THE PROGRAM. AND THEN IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE SEE THAT PROGRAM ABANDONED TO WHERE WE'RE AT TODAY NOW TALKING AGAIN ABOUT ESTABLISHING MONEY TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS I WANT TO THANK THE MINISTRATION THOSE MOVING FORWARD WITH THE TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS BUT IT'S ONE TIME FUNDING. WE GOT TO START TALKING ABOUT THE ON GOING FUNDING AND REESTABLISHING THE TROOP COMMITMENT TO HEALTH CARE FOR CALIFORNIA'S FIRST PEOPLE IN MY OFFICE IS OPEN TO DIALOGUE AND DISCUSS THIS ISSUE. BUT I THINK IT'S TIME WE START TO SEE THE DATA IS STATISTICS NOT CHANGE FROM BACK IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE TO WHERE WE'RE AT TODAY. A GENUINE DISCUSSION HAS TO BE MADE ABOUT THE HEALTH CARE OF ALL CALIFORNIA INDIAN PEOPLE AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN GENERAL WHICH THE CALIFORNIA PEOPLE ARE THE FIRST. FIRST PEOPLE HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO I WELCOME THAT DISCUSSION I THANK THE TWELVE TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME FUNDING. BUT WE HAVE TO TRULY START TO TALK ABOUT THE ONGOING FUNDING. WHEN WE START TO SEE THE UNDERLYING CONDITIONS STATISTICS AND DATA AND HEALTH CARE WHERE CALIFORNIA INDIAN PEOPLE ARE STILL SUFFERING A HIGHER RATE THAN ANY OTHER GROUP OUT THERE IN THIS TESTIMONY IS DONE HERE TODAY BY THOSE PRESENTING. THAT A TEST OF THAT. I THINK NOW IT WARRANTS NOW MORE THAN EVER THAT DISCUSSION TO MOVE FORWARD AND I THINK AGAIN THE ONE TIME MONEY BUT IT HAS TO BE ONGOING IN OUR OFFICE IS OPEN TO DISCUSS THAT WITH YOU. SO WHERE IS THAT DISCUSSION I GUESS IS THE QUESTION MISTER CHAIR AND IF I COULD GET SOME FEEDBACK FROM THOSE THAT ARE ON THE ZOOM TO PRESENTING. ARE WE READY FOR A GENUINE DISCUSSION TO MOVE FORWARD WITH ONGOING FUNDING- PER TRIP DEPUTY DIRECTOR COOPER THAT'S GOING TO BE DIRECTED AT ANDREW DUFFY FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE.

UNTIL FUNDING WAS CUT IN TWO THOUSAND NINE- SINCE FUNDING WAS LIMITED HEALTH DISPARITIES IN TRIBAL COMMUNITIES HAVE NOT- IMPROVED. IN FACT- NEEDED PEOPLE WERE THREE AND A HALF TIMES. MORE LIKELY THAN GENERAL HELP POPULATION. I TO BE HOSPITALIZED- BY WACO IN NINETEEN- SUICIDE AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE RATES HAVE SKYROCKETED- IN TRIBAL COMMUNITIES DURING THE PANDEMIC- INTO MORTALITY RATE IN TRIBAL COMMUNITIES ALMOST TWICE THAT OF THE GENERAL POPULATION- IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN- ALIENS ARE AMERICAN LASKIN IT IS- WERE 50% MORE LIKELY TO BE DIAGNOSED WITH. CORONARY HEART DISEASE AND ARE TWICE AS LIKELY TO HAVE DIABETES- THAN THEIR NON HISPANIC WHITE COUNTERPART- THIS IS A FEW OF THE HEALTH DISPARITIES THAT EXIST IN TRIBAL COMMUNITIES- BUT THEY EXPRESSED A DEFINITE NEED FOR ONGOING FUNDING- ON ANOTHER NOTE- PERSON DOORS IN A PUBLIC LOT TO EIGHTY- THE STATE HAS A RESPONSIBILITY TO PROVIDE HEALTH AND SAFETY RESOURCES TO TRAVEL COMMUNITIES. AFTER NOT FAMILIAR WITH PUBLIC LAW TO EIGHTY- IT GAVE THE STATE JURISDICTION OVER TRIBAL LANDS IN EXCHANGE. FOR THE PROMISE OF- READY HEALTH AND SAFETY RE. TO TRAVEL. I WITHOUT ON GOING- ANY HEALTH PROGRAM FUNDING TRAVEL HEALTH PROGRAMS. CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE TO RECRUIT RETAIN MEDICAL PROVIDERS I DO THE RURAL LOCATIONS- AND THE SIGNIFICANT FUNDING DISPARITIES BETWEEN. INDIAN HEALTH SERVICE PROVIDERS AND OTHER FEDERALLY FUNDED.

BASED ON TREATIES AND STATUTES SUCH AS PUBLIC LAW TO EIGHTY- INDIFFERENCE TO THIS FACT THE STATE EXEMPTED NATIVE PEOPLE FROM THE STATE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE- CRITICALLY AGREES THIS COURSE OF ACTION. HOWEVER TRAVEL HEALTH PROGRAMS ARE STILL REQUIRED TO PROVIDE HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO UNINSURED INDIANS- AND DO NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO THE BILL FOR THE SERVICES- INDIAN HEALTH PROGRAM FUNDS HAVE TRADITIONALLY HELP PROVIDE- HEALTH SERVICES TO THIS UNINSURED POPULATION.
