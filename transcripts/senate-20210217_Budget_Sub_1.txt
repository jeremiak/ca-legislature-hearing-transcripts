LOOKING AT THE BIG PICTURE AT THE GOVERNOR'S BY PROPOSAL CAN CAUSE FOUR BILL. IN LOCAL ASSISTANCE ON FOR TWO COLLEGES AND THE DOCTOR. THE NEW ESTIMATES AND WORK FACT THE BY CRUNCH TOLD COMP REVENUE FOR THE STATE CENTERED FUNDING FORMULA AND SEVEN POINT. SIX SEVEN DOLLAR. OR TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY JAIL. THIS IS UP TO THE PROJECT OF SEVEN POINT THREE BILLION. FOR TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE AT THE TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET ACT. INCLUDING THE TO ARE EIGHT TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO COSTA LIVING AND- OR COLA- ONE FIVE PER OR A HUNDRED ELEVEN POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS. AND TWENTY FOUR POINT DOLLARS. IN ORDER ONE THAT THE CALIFORNIA CAN COLLEGES CONTINUE TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THEIR STUDENTS. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET REQUIRES SEVERAL CONDITIONS FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES- DISTRICTS ARE RECEIVING P. TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO KOLEJKA. FIRST EACH COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICTS. REPORT DETAILING SPECIFIC. ACTIONABLE PLANS ON HOW THEY PLAN TO CLOSE ACHIEVEMENT GAPS BY TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN IN FURTHERANCE BUT THE GOLD OUTLINED IN ADDITION FOR SUCCESS. SECOND COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT SHOT POLICIES TO MAINTAIN ONLINE COURSE AND PROGRAMS AT A LEVEL THAT A TEN PERCENTAGE POINTS HIGHER THAN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN LEVELS. I WILL LEVERAGE ON THE ONLINE COURSE PROPOSED. DURING ITEM OF YEAR. I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT SIMILAR EXPECT FOR THE UC AND CSU OR AT THE GOVERNMENT BUDGET AS WELL. THE TERM.

NINE HUNDRED POINT EIGHT MILLION FROM PHYSICAL YOUR TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AND FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVEN POINT NINE MILLION PER FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. BY CONTINUING TO IMPLEMENT A DEFERRAL. ALBEIT AT A SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER LEVEL THE ADMINISTRATION IS ABLE TO INCLUDE ADDITIONAL PROPOSALS DESIGNED DIRECT TO DIRECTLY ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS. AND HELP THEM THROUGH THIS DIFFICULT TIME. AS WELL AS TRY TO COUNTER THE ENROLLMENT. REPORTER FOR FALL TWENTY TWENTY TERM. AND WITH THAT ABOUT IT ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NOW WILL MOVE TO THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST. THEN AND WILL DO QUESTIONS AFTER ALL PANELISTS OF SMOKE. GOOD MORNING ALL STATE HOUSE AND WITH THE ANALYST'S OFFICE. SO YESTERDAY OUR OFFICE RECEIVED- RELEASE AND ANALYSIS OF THE GOVERNOR'S COMMUNITY COLLEGE PROPOSAL'S TITLE THE TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES. WE WORKED WITH STAFF TO INCORPORATE MUCH OF THAT REPORT INTO YOUR AGENDA. CHIU WITH REGARD TO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSE ONE POINT 5% COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT ON APPORTIONMENT. WE NOTE IN OUR REPORT THAT DISTRICTS ARE FACING A NUMBER OF COST PRESSURES. IN THE BUDGET YEAR I HEALTH CARE PREMIUM INCREASES. TENSION INCREASES ALL THOSE THOSE REALLY RAMP UP STARTING IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE VARIOUS OTHER OUR BASE OPERATING COST INCREASES AND PRESSURE TO INCREASE EMPLOYEE SALARIES ESPECIALLY AFTER NOT RECEIVING A CALL UP. IN THE CURRENT YEAR. SO THE CALL RATE WHICH IS BASED ON A PRICE INDEX OF OUR STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WILL BE UPDATED IN APRIL WHEN THE STATE RECEIVES ADDITIONAL ECONOMIC DATA BY EARLY MAY THE LEGISLATURE ALSO HAVE BETTER INFORMATION ON STATE REVENUES. WHICH IN TURN WILL AFFECT THE AMOUNT AVAILABLE TO SPEND ON K. FOURTEEN EDUCATION THROUGH PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT. IF ADDITIONAL ONGOING PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE IN MAY THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO CONSIDER PROVIDED ME PROVIDING AN EVEN GREATER INCREASED TO APPORTIONMENT. AND WHAT THE GOVERNOR IS CURRENTLY PROPOSING. THE LEGISLATURE COULD ALSO CONSIDER REPURPOSE SEEN LOWER PRIORITY PROPOSALS AND THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET TO SUPPORT A LARGER BASE AUGMENTATIONTO APPORTIONMENT. AND THROUGHOUT THIS HEARING I WILL IDENTIFY SOME PROPOSALS THAT MIGHT BE GOOD CANDIDATES FOR SUCH A REDIRECTION. WITH REGARD TO THE PROPOSAL FOR DISTRICTS TO DEVELOP EQUITY PLANS AS A CONDITION OF RECEIVING A COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT IN THE BUDGET YEAR WE WOULD NOTE THAT SUCH A REQUIREMENT IS ALREADY- IN STATUTE. ACTUALLY THE DISTRICTS ARE REQUIRED TO. DEVELOP AND MAINTAIN STUDENT EQUITY PLANS AS A CONDITION OF RECEIVING STUDENT EQUITY AND ACHIEVEMENT MONEY SO WE THINK. THAT IN THIS CONDITION AS PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR WOULD REALLY BE REDUNDANT WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE REJECT THIS PROPOSAL. ON THE PROPOSED RULE PAYDOWNS WE THANK THE GOVERNOR IS REALLY ON THE RIGHT TRACK. BY PAYING DOWN SO MUCH OF THE DEFERRALS ARE BUT COULD GO EVEN FURTHER AND PAY OFF EVEN MORE OF THEM. I'M USING ONE TIME FUNDS TO RETIRE MORE THE% DEFERRALS. HAS A LOT OF ADVANTAGES- REDUCE SEEN DISTRICTS- NEED FOR BORROWING FOR CASH FLOW PURPOSES. IT ALSO GIVES THE LEGISLATURE MORE BUDGET TOOLS TO RESPOND TO FUTURE ECONOMIC DOWNTURNS. SO THROUGHOUT OUR REPORT AND IN THIS HEARING- WE DO IDENTIFY SOME LOWER PRIORITY PROPOSALS AND THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THEY COULD BE USED INSTEAD TO PAY DOWN MORE REFERRALS OR HELP DISTRICTS. IN OTHER WAYS SUCH AS BY MITIGATING FUTURE. PENSION COST INCREASES. SEVEN OTHER TOPIC IN ISSUE ONE CAN- IN ROME IN A ROW GROWTH. THE PANDEMIC IN THE RECESSION HAVE REDUCE SIGNIFICANTLY- ENROLLMENT DEMAND OF THIS YEAR. IN THE NEXT SEVERAL MONTHS WILL HAVE A MUCH CLEARER IDEA ON ROMAN WHERE ENROLLMENT MIGHT GO INTO ONE TWENTY TWO YEAH THERE'S A LOT OF REASONS WHY ENROLLMENT DEMAND IS DOWN THE STUDENTS NOT WANTING TO TAKE ONLINE ONLY COURSES. CERTAIN COURSES ARE NOT OFFER BECAUSE THEY DON'T CONVERT WELL TO AN ONLINE ENVIRONMENT STUDENTS- A LOT OF TIMES SPECIALLY ROLLER HAVE LIVED TAX. TO ONLINE CLASSES- IT MIGHT NOT HAVE A QUIET PLACE TO TAKE THEIR CLASSES ARE TO STUDY OUR HAVE CHILD RESPONSIBILITIES AND THEIR THEIR KIDS OR OTHER OTHERS ARE HAVING TO TAKE CARE OF OUR ARE. AT HOME RATHER THAN IN THEIR K. TWELVE SCHOOLS. ANOTHER BIG REASON IS OUR INDIVIDUALS AND FLOSSER JOBS ARE LOOKING FOR JOBS- THEIR FAMILY INCOME HAS DECLINED AND SO THEY NEED TO WORK RIGHT NOW RATHER THAN I TAKE TIME TO GO TO SCHOOL. SO DISTRICTS ARE HOPEFUL ALL RIGHT NOW THAT THEY CAN OFFER A LOT MORE IN PERSON COURSES IN THE FALL BUT FOR NOW THEY ARE TAKING A GENERALLY TAKING A WAIT AND SEE APPROACH YOU KNOW LOOKING AT OTHER VACCINES VACCINE DEPLOYMENT LOOKING AT THE OVERALL PROGRESS TOWARD. HERD IMMUNITY SOME OF COLLEGES AND SCHOOLS REOPEN IN-THE FALL AND THE ECONOMY. IS STILL SLOW TO RECOVER. THIS COULD SEE A SIR. IN IN. ON OTHER HAND IF CALL AND ARE. REMAIN PRIMARILY ON. AND FALL WE SEE CURRENT. TRENDS. ALSO LATER THIS MONTH THE CHANCE OFF WILL RELEASE UPDATED- AND ROMAN A DATA ON THE CURRENT YEAR. SO WE'LL HAVE THAT DATA SOON AND BY SPRING WILL LIKELY HAVE A CLEAR PICTURE OF WHERE THE STATE AND COLLEGES AND SCHOOLS ARE ARE HEADED IN TERMS OF- ENROLLMENT. STARTS A PLANS FOR THE FALL AND SO THE LEGISLATURE WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY- IN THE COMING MONTHS USE THAT DATA TO MAKE A CALL ON A ROMAN FUNDING AT THAT TIME. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THEN THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. THIS MORNING SENATOR LAYERED AND MEMBERS OF THE SENATE BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE ON EDUCATION MANY MISSILES THAT NUMBER AT AND I SERVICES BY STUDENTS FOR COLLEGE FINANCE OF THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES. AS WE APPROACH THE ONE YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF THE COPA NINETEEN PANDEMIC THIS IS THE DISRUPTION ITS CAUSES ARE ALL TOO FAMILIAR OUR STATE OUR STUDENTS OUR SYSTEM HAVE BEEN SUBSTANTIALLY CHANGED AND THE RESULTS IN THE AFFECTS CONTINUE TO CHALLENGER CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES. HOWEVER WE BELIEVE THE RING ROAD TO RECOVERY WILL PRESENT OPPORTUNITIES TO ADAPT AND TO VIEW COMMUNITY COLLEGES I START AS A STRATEGIC INVESTMENT IN A MORE EQUITABLE. AND RESILIENT CALIFORNIA. WE ME. FOR A BI PROPOSAL THAT LAYS A STRONG FOUNDATION FOR THE POST PANDA RECOVER. DURING THIS CRISIS PROVIDING FISCAL STABILITY HAS BEEN A TOP PRIORITY TO THAT END DATE CANCERS OFFICE HAS USED A MULTI FACETED APPROACH TO PROVIDE FISCAL STABILITY DURING THIS UNCERTAIN PERIOD. THIS APPROACH INCLUDED ONE THE APPLICATION OF TITLE FIVE EMERGENCY CONDITION ALLOWANCES TO DISTRICT WHOSE ENROLLMENT WAS IMPACTED BY THE COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC. AND TO EQUITY ADJUSTMENT TO THE DEFERRAL CALCULATION WHICH ENSURED EACH DISTRICT RECEIVED AT LEAST 83% OF THEIR REVENUE FROM ALL SOURCES AND PREVENTED DISTRICTS AND LOCAL PROPERTY WEALTH COMMUNITIES COMMUNITIES. FROM BEARING THE BURDEN OF DEFERRALS AS THEY TRADITIONALLY DO. THESE ACTIONS HAVE ENABLED SOME FISCAL STABILITY. DURING THIS COMPLEX PERIOD. HOWEVER THE PANDEMIC CONTINUES AND THE RETURN TO NORMAL APPEARS MORE DISTANT IT IS CLEAR TO EVALUATE AND PLAN FOR THE LONG TERM FISCAL RESILIENCY OTHER SYSTEM. THAT INCLUDES PERFORMING FINANCIAL AID FOR STUDENTS WE TELL ADDRESS AN ITEM TO. PROVIDING ONGOING RESOURCES CHORE DISTRICTS AS THEY PREPARE FOR INCREASED COSTS IN RECURRING EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH A SAFE CAMPUS RE OPENING. PAYING DEFERRALS AND CONTINUING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF STUDENT CENTERED FUNDING FORMULA WHICH PRESENTS OPPORTUNITIES TO MORE DELIBERATELY FOCUSED ON ENROLLING ANSWERING MORE LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS AND SUPPORTING THEIR SUCCESSFUL JOURNEY. IN THE MIDST OF A PANDEMIC OUR COLLEGES HAVE EXPERIENCED THE SOCIAL RECKONING OCCURRING ACROSS THE COUNTRY CHALLENGING US TO DISMANTLE STRUCTURES AND PRACTICES THAT PERPETUATE SYSTEMIC RACISM. SINCE TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE VISION FOR SUCCESS HAS SERVED AS THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES NORTH STAR TO CLOSING EQUITY GAPS THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL PRESENTS AN OPPORTUNITY TO ALIGN SEVERAL KEY PLANS THAT ARE PRODUCED BY OUR COLLEGES. INCLUDING STUDENT EQUITY IN ACHIEVING PLANS AND LOCAL VISION GOALS THESE EFFORTS ARE NOT NEW TO OUR COLLEGES RATHER THEY WILL BE APPROACHED MORE COHESIVELY. WE SUPPORT THE PROPOSING AND ONGOING FUNDS INCLUDING A COLA AND GROSS. UNDER THE SCF GROWTH CAN SEE MORE THAN THE TWO NOTION OF INCREASED ENROLLMENTS BUT RATHER GROSS CAN. EFFORTS BY COLLEGES THAT I'VE SEEN INCREASES IN THE LOW INCOME STUDENTS THEY SERVE AND IN THEIR SUCCESS. WHERE POSSIBLE WE ENCOURAGE MORE ON GOING SUPPORT FOR THE LONG TERM OPERATIONAL NEEDS OF OUR COLLEGES. LASTLY WE URGE THAT SHOULD NEW RESOURCES BE MADE AVAILABLE AT ME REVISED. PRIORITY BE PLACED ON PAYING DOWN DEFERRALS THAT DISTRICTS ARE NOT THREATENED BY FUTURE UNCERTAINTIES OF THESE DEBTS OWED TO THEM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ON THIS ITEM. THNK YOU VERY MUCH. AND NOW WE WILL MOVE TO QUESTIONS ON ITEM NUMBER ONE INDECISIVE AT THE OUTSET OF THE HEARING THIS'LL PROBABLY BE THE PLACE. WHERE THE MOST QUESTIONS BECAUSE THIS IS WHERE THERE IS A COMPLETE OVERVIEW. OF THE BUDGET LET ME BEGIN BY ASKING FINANCE- ALL THREE OF THE WITNESSES MENTIONED- JUST THE STATUS OF PAYING OFF DEFERRALS. GIVEN THE FACT THAT LOCAL DISTRICTS HAVE TO PAY INTEREST ON THE DEFERRALS. INTO GIVEN THE FACT THAT IF FOR AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN. GOES INTO THE NEXT YEAR THIS MIGHT BE A TOOL WE WANT IN THE TOOL BOX. WHY WAS THE CHOICE MADE NOT TO PAY OFF DEFERRALS IN THIS PROPOSED BUDGET. DAN OUR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- SO DIMINISH ASIAN UNDERSTAND BUT OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND OUR STUDENTS ESPECIALLY OUR ARE STILL IN NEED OF IMMEDIATE RESOURCES- HELP THEM WEATHER THE STORM OF CO THE NINETEEN- AND BY GETTING A SMALL BUBBLE FOR ALL OF I DID RESEARCH ARE FREE TO. IN OUR AREAS OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE BUDGET HELP PROVIDE. MEDIA FUNDS GENERALLY TO STUDENTS. AND IF YOU DON'T PAY OFF THE DEFERRAL AND ECONOMIC CAN AT THE ARE ONE TIME HELPS TO SEE. WERE TO SET LEAVE US NEXT YEAR AND ABOUT. I THINK THAT THE SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO TAKE WHEN WE WHEN WE TO THAT POINT AGAIN- THIS BUDGET REALLY TO BALANCE THE AVAILABLE GOING ON ONCE EVERY. OF BASED ON OUR OUR- ARE AND HELPING TRYING HELP STUDENTS TO THAT THE CURRENT STORM A CO IN NINETEEN. ARE L. A. O. T. A ANY OF COMMENT ON THIS. OF THE DEFERRALS AND DID MADE I KNOW YOU MAY IN YOUR- COMMENTS BRIDGES IF YOU HAD ANY OF THE CON. YEAH THINGS STAFF- FIRST OF ALL. THIS BY GETTING PAID LESS DISTRICTS ARE EITHER HAVING A EXTERNALLY WHERE THEY MIGHT PAY INTEREST AS YOU MAY. WHAT IS HAVE RESERVES THEY'RE HAVING TO TAP INTO TO MEET- WHEN MONEY FOR THE STATE COMES AND CASE OR- I. ON THEIR ARE THERE ARE- THERE THEY'RE NOT GETTING THE ARE. ON THERE AND SO THAT'S MY THAT THAT IT INSTEAD BEING A VET HAVE TO GO OUT PAYROLL TOLD TO STAY. IS ABLE TO PAY. ANOTHER THING- TO KNOW IS. OUR VIEW IS IF THE STATE. YOU WANT TO. YOU WANNA PAY AUTOCRATIC. AS SOON AS CAN. OF THE DAY. AND NOT AT ALL NOW WHEN STATE HAS. ONE TIME MONEY AND QUITE A BIT OF ONE TIME MONEY. IS THAT IT JUST SORT OF A- AND JUST DOESN'T GET PAID AND- IN WHEN YOU AS YOU MAY IF YOU A DOWN. SAY ANY THE YEAR TO HAVE DOWNTURN. EVEN NOW YOU DON'T HAVE THAT OFF ON THE TWO TO FOR. THREE TWENTY MILLION. FROM MAY TO JULY OR JUNE TO JULY AND THAT FACT OF- LOW HANGING FRUIT AS IT AS A BUDGET SOLUTION IS ALREADY BEEN USED BECAUSE BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T ADDRESS IT WHEN YOU COULD HAVE. AND SO IT'S JUST KIND OF KEEPING THAT IN MIND. THE IMPACT ON THE DISTRICTS AND HAVING TO BORROW INTERNALLY OR EXTERNALLY AND THEN NOT HAVING THAT AS A BUDGET SOLUTION IN THE OUT YEARS. WHEN YOU REALLY MIGHT NEED IT. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS AND OTHER COMMITTEE. OF RIGHT TIME SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES BUT- I REALLY SUBSCRIBE TO THE NOTION THAT WE SHOULD PRIORITIZE PAYING OFF THE DEFERRALS AND- AS YOU. GO TOWARD THE MAY REVISE IF THERE IS EXTRA MONEY. OR YOU DECIDE YOU WANT TO REASSIGN PRIORITIES THAT WOULD BE AN IMPORTANT THING TO DO. THEN LET ME NEXT ASK ABOUT ENROLLMENT GROWTH. AND THE L. A. O. JUST SAID THAT- AS TO ARE COMING- BUT WAS WONDERING AND MAYBE ALL ASK THE- A. O. FOR AND GO FINANCE. OR THE- CHEN OFFICE DOES AND- HAVE ANY ESTIMATE OF WHAT THE ENROLLMENT LOSS HAS BEEN. SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC TO NOW. IT SAYS THE C. L. A- NOW YEAH. HISTORY YEAH WE'VE- WE DON'T HAVE FINAL DATA AT LEAST WHEN WE LOOKED AT. AS OF ABOUT TWO WEEKS AGO- WE LOOKED AT ENROLLMENT DATA. BY DISTRICT IN. THE FALL AND- YOU WASN'T COMPLETE THEN I IT'S GETTING THERE I TO BUT WE DON'T THE FINAL NUMBERS YET THOUGH SHOULD COME SOON. BUT WHAT WE SAW WAS- THE MOMENT WAS DOWN IN FALL TWENTY TWENTY- BY ABOUT 10% NINETEEN. AND IT SEEMED TO AFFECT. VIRTUALLY ALL DISTRICTS VIRTUALLY ALL DISTRICTS FOR DOWN BASED ON AS I SAID THAT KIND OF INCOMPLETE DATA OTHER WE HAVE. AND THE KIND OF MORE THAN THAT- RECEIVE JUST. IN OF. ON CERTAIN. GROUP OF STUDENTS AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS. WE SEE EVEN MORE OF A PRONOUNCED REDUCTION. WE ALSO SEE A MORE OF A KIND OF DISPROPORTIONAL IMPACT ON MALE STUDENTS IN GENERAL AN OLDER ADULTS FOR THAT MATTER. SO THE DATA IS KIND OF COMING IN NOW BUT IT'S- IT'S REALLY- WHAT WE TEND TO SEE THROUGHOUT THROUGHOUT THE STATE THROUGHOUT THE REGIONS IS. IS A REDUCTION IN ENROLLMENT ENROLLMENT COMMANDED THROUGHOUT THE SYSTEM. THANK YOU WHAT DOES THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE HAVE ANYTHING THEY WISH TO ADD ALMOND. THANK YOU SENATOR LAYERED- CURRENTLY ABOUT 90% OF THE COLLEGES HAVE REPORTED ENROLLMENT DATA SO A PICTURE AROUND ENROLLMENT IS BECOMING CLEARER AND WE'VE SEEN DIFFERENCES THAN WHAT WE SAW IN SPRING AND SUMMER AND SPRING AND SUMMER AND ROMAN HAD. HELD STEADY AND SUMMER WE EVEN SAW GROWTH COME FALL- AS THE ELLIE- MENTIONED WE HAVE SEEN A RANGE ACROSSTHE STATE WITH SOME COLLEGES HOLDING AT ABOUT HALF A PERCENT DECLINE TO SOME AS MANY IN THE DOUBLE DIGIT PERCENTAGE. AND MOST STARK IS WHAT WE'VE SEEN AGAIN ARE UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS OF COLOR WHY AGAIN YOU SEE OUR STRONG SUPPORT OF EFFORTS THAT PUT STUDENTS FIRST RECOGNIZING THAT THERE'S CLEARLY ENOUGH FACT HAPPENING ON STUDENTS AND THEIR ABILITY TO STAY ENGAGED IN OUR COLLEGES. AND WHATEVER WE CAN DO TO SUPPORT THEM IN THEIR JOURNEY OR AND RETURNING BACK TO OUR CAMPUSES IS KEY- AS WE BEGAN TO FURTHER ANALYZE WHAT IS HAPPENING. WE WANT TO LEARN ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING TO THESE PARTICULAR STUDENTS ARE AGAIN MANY OF THE EARLY PRESUMPTIONS ARE THESE ARE WORKING LEARNERS- KAREN'S AND THOSE THAT WERE ALREADY ON THE CUSP OF POVERTY. AND ANY EMERGENCY CAN PUT THE STUDENTS IN OUR STUDENTS OVER THE ADS SO- SOME OF THE KIND OF EARLY FINDINGS THAT WE ARE SEEING THANK YOU. ARM I HAVE A BRIEF COMMENT AND NON I WANNA DIRECT QUESTIONS TO FINANCE AND H. R. WAS ON A COMMUNITY COLLEGE BOARD FOR EIGHT YEARS BEFORE SELECTED TO THE ASSEMBLY. AND IN MY HOME DISTRICT THE ENROLLMENT IS DOWN EIGHTEEN PERCENT. AND I DID ASSUME WITH THE CHANCELLOR OF THE LOS ANGELES COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM AND HE TOLD ME THAT IN ROME. WAS DOWN 10% ARE WE GAS. ONE THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE JUST SO. SOME ARE DOWN A HALF OF. THAT IS REALLY THE- BUT I THINK WE GONNA FONG A SOMETHING THAT'S MORE TOWARD THE- AND MIKE FOR. IS IF ENROLLMENT IS DOWN AND MAYBE BY LET'S JUST PICK A NUMBER AVERAGE BY 10% ACROSS THE STATE. OF WHY DID YOU RECOMMEND FUNDING FOR ENROLLMENT GROWTH. HOW DO THOSE TWO THINGS FIT TOGETHER. DAN OUR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- SO THIS IS REALLY MORE OF A TECHNICAL ADJUSTMENT THAN IT IS- UP. IT IS MORE BATES ON. THREE IT'S GROWTH THAT HAS ALREADY HAPPENED SO THIS IS REFLECTING THE FACT THAT S. T. E. R. FOR TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY WAS ABOVE THE LEVEL THAT WE HAD PREVIOUSLY- ESTIMATED OR OR I HAD COME AND WILL BE PUT IN FOR THE TOTAL COMPUTATIONAL REVENUE FOR THAT YEAR. SO AND IT'S BASED ON THAT THAT THREE YEAR ROLLING AVERAGE ABOUT THAT FTS AND MOVE FORWARD IN THE FORMULA AND HOW IT AFFECTS- ALL THREE ARE- SO AGAIN I THINK WE ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT THE ARE. GENERAL THE QUAN ARE NOT GO TO WHAT WE AS WELL DISASTER. ON THE ENDING LEVEL OF TWO NINETEEN F. E. R. BASED ON ABOUT WHAT WE HAD PREVIOUSLY. FOR THE WATCH AT HOME ARE YOU JUST LAUNCHED IN AN ONYX ACT SO YOU'RE TALKING FOR TIME THE GLOBAL STUDENT RIGHT FOR T. S. YEAH MY APOLOGIES ON THE NOT NO FOR. I SAW UNDER BROWN AND HE BE BY MY HEAD RIGHT SO I AN UNDER. ACRONYMS A NUMBER. YOUR DIRECT. COULD INST YOU ON. HOW THAT HAPPENED HER AS WELL REGULAR. AND SO WHAT REALLY IS THE RECORD RECOMMENDATION ABOUT AND ENROLLMENT IS MORE RETROS. IN YOUR IT'S NOT AND- THAT GONNA WORK OUT OF THIS AND THEN TO MOVE INTO A WRONG GROWTH. RIGHT YES SENATE YET- YES IT IS MORE ABOUT- I JUST MEANT THAT IT IS LIKE OUR PROJECTION OF THE PUBLIC. AND DOES L. A. O. OF ANY KIND ON THIS THAT DAY BEEN ADDRESSED OR IN COMMENTS. YEAH JUST ON ON YOUR- JUST NOW- I MENTION THAT. EARLIER BUT- THE CHANCE OFFICE IS WORKING ON. UPDATE INFORMATION ON IN ROME FOR THE CURRENT FOR TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND THAT INFORMATION IS GOING TO. PROVIDE MORE CLARITY ON IN ROMAN GROWTH ON PRIOR GROWTH IT'S A LITTLE MORE COMPLICATED BECAUSE AS YOU HEARD FROM THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE THE CHANCES OFFICES INVOKE TO EMERGENCY CONDITIONS ALLOWANCES- SO THAT- COLLEGES ARTS- HARM FINANCIALLY. THE PANDEMIC IN THE DOWNTURN FROM THE PANDA SO LOSING EIGHTY A LOOK AT THE UPDATED NUMBERS INTERNATIONALLY CONDITIONS ALLOWANCE WHETHER IT REALLY IS THE CASE THAT DISTRICTS HAVE AN ABILITY TO GROW AND CAN USE AN APPOINTMENT GROWTH MONEY BECAUSE THAT'S NOT APPARENT TO US RIGHT NOW GIVEN EVEN BEFORE THE PANDEMIC THERE WERE DOWNTURNS. IN IN A MOMENT THE SOFTNESS OF THE MOMENT A LOT OF. PLACES IN THE STATE. THANK YOU AND I A- FROM MICHELLE NO OF. THE DEPARTMENT OF FINE WITH LIKE TO SEE SOMETHING. MORNING EARLIER UNDER WHEN FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINE- DO A BUILD UP MY COLLEAGUE I DO HANNAH OR- COMMENT AND YOU KNOW TO ECHO. THAT- MY COLLEAGUE A CHANCE OFFICE AND UNUSED. OR ANY UNUSED AND GROWTH DAHLE CAN IN STILL BE TO OTHER OF THE STUDENTS FUNDING FORMULA. YOU KNOW GROW IN MENTAL HEALTH. GROWTH IN SIX ALIKI. AS WELL AS YOU KNOW BACK TELLING- YOU KNOW PROPERTY TAX. SOURCE. I I'VE BEEN OUT I THINK YOU I'M ONLY GROWTH AND IS A VERY TERM YOU OFF WITH THE IT'S FOR AND GROWTH SPECIFIC BUT IT BE USED HAVE FUN PARTS THE- FOR ME MORTGAGE. AND WHAT THE TRICK. WHAT'S THE TRIGGER FOR DISH TO BE TO YOU THE CROSSMAN YOU'RE MAKING IT SOUND LIKE THEY JUST USE IT. OF HOW TALL TO GROW IF IT'S RECTORS. IT'S THEIR AND THEY CAN JUST YOU IT FOR PART. SEPE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. I THINK I SAY IS THAT IF. YES WHAT HEY YOU KNOW THE WHAT WE ARE AWARE WE RECKON THE AND DECLINED. WE'RE SEEING A THE- INSIDE AT THREE POINT IN THAT YOU OFFICE DETERMINED THERE'S IN OTHER THAN THERE MAY BE AN EVEN. EMERALD GROWTH BASED ON A THREE YEAR AVERAGE SO IF YOU KNOW. AT THAT POINT THEN THEY MAY TAKE THE MORE OF IT I THINK ADMINISTRATIVE ON THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE AND THEY CAN TAKE THAT ON I KNEW THEN ROAMING GROWTH AND PLUG IT INTO OTHER PARKING FORMULA THE CHANCELLOR'S FOR THOSE OF YOU FOLLOWING UP ON THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE STAFFER HAS BEEN NODDING DURING THIS PRESENTATION. DO YOU HAVE ANY- AND NOT NODDING OFF JUST NODDING SO DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING YOU'D LIKE TO ADD TO THAT. THANK YOU SENATOR. AS I WOULD I WOULD ADD TO- APPOINT MICHAEL FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE MENTIONED OUR ENROLLMENT UNDER THIS NEW FORMULA IS IN MANY WAYS A MISNOMER BECAUSE IT COLLEGE CAN ESSENTIALLY THOSE RESOURCES CAN BE USED TO PAY A COLLEGE FOR ANY GROWTH AND AGAIN AS I MENTIONED- THEIR ENROLLMENT OF LOW INCOME STUDENTS- UNDER THE SUPPLEMENT ALLOCATION OR THEIR INCREASES OUR GROWTH AND SUCCESSES- AND- TO PORTIONS OF OUR FORMULA AREN'T BASED ON THREE YEAR AVERAGES. AND SO THAT MEANS THAT AS WE'RE CALCULATING THIS IS BUILDING FORWARD AND WE'RE BUILDING AND INCREASED SUCCESSES OF OUR COLLEGES TO AREAS WHERE COLLEGES HAVE DONE WELL THEY'VE DONE MUCH MORE TO BE INTENTIONAL ABOUT ENROLLING IN CONNECTING STUDENTS TO FINANCIAL AID SO WE ANTICIPATE THAT MOVING FORWARD GIVEN THE URGENCY AROUND MAKING EIGHT AVAILABLE AT THIS WILL BE AN AREA WHERE WE DO SEE SOME INCREASES. AND COULD LEVERAGE THESE DOLLARS. THANK YOU AND I'M GONNA AND QUESTION AND AMOUNT OF BACK TO THE- BETWEEN THE FOR HERE YEARS BUT WHAT JUST ASK. A RELATED QUESTION A FINAL SO. THERE IS A COLD IN HERE. A OF FOUR THE BUDGET YEAR. HOW DO YOU SEE THE COLD FITTING ENROLLMENT AND UNPAID OFF TO F. HOUSE IS THAT IN YOUR MY FOR TOGETHER. MICHON OF. THE CHAU LUEN DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- NO IT IT MIGHT BE DELAYED BUT IT'LL GET TO WHOEVER'S TALKING. YEAH IT SHIFTED OVER TO MICHAEL. ON SCREEN SO I KNOW HE LOOKED LIKE HE WAS YOUNG FOR YOU TO TALK SO PLEASE GO AHEAD. SO IF I AM I UNDERSTAND YOUR- RIGHT AND I MEAN BE PLEASE YOU KNOW UP- IF THAT IS THE CASE. THAT THE CALL IS SIMPLY BY. THE DEBT RATE WENT DOWN. BUT STUDENTS I FUNDING FORMULA SO- THERE THE RATE FOR- FTS OR IT'S THE ALEX. AT THE END ROLE PART OF FOR. THERE IS A RATE FOR THE COUPLE KNOWLEDGE THANKS FOR YOUR YOUR NOTE YOU'RE ACTUALLY DOES THE LAW BIT OF THE WATER BILL. IN AND WHAT I WAS TO DO. IS THE BUDGET IS A C. OF TWO. SO THERE WAS A RECOMMENDED CHOICE NOT TO PAY OFF THE DEFERRALS THERE WAS A RECOMMENDED CHOICE FOR CERTAIN ENROLLMENT GROWTH. AND THERE'S A RECOMMENDED CHOICE FOR COAL EVERY ONE OF THOSE WOULD BE IT. COULD BE AT DIFFERENT LEVELS SO WHAT INFORMED YOU IN NOT PAYING OFF THE DEFERRALS DURING AN ENROLLMENT GROWTH OF A CERTAIN AMOUNT AND THEN DOING A COAL OF A CERTAIN AMOUNT ALL OF WHICH- COULD BE PUT TOGETHER IN A DIFFERENT. FRAMEWORK OF PRIORITIES I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE CALL WASN'T WROTE HE DID NOT A MEDICALLY DO IT BECAUSE OF SOME FACTORS RIGHT TO SORT OF A CHOICE TO RECOMMENDED AT THE LEVEL. THAT IT WAS RECOMMENDED. SO THAT CALL IS BASS UPON. A ONE TWENTY COMP. OF THE CALL AT GOVERNOR'S BUDGET- HELLO. HERE YOU TECH WE CAN HEAR ME IS ON MY PART OKAY GREAT- SO- WITH REGARD TO THE COLA THE COLON IS THAT IS A- AND THAT'S BASED ON IT AND THAT MIGHT COLLEAGUES THE L. A. O. AND MEN IT THE TWENTY TWENTY COMP. OF. THE COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT AND THAT'S THAT ONE POINT 5% WE- THE GOVERNOR IS. PRESS FORWARD. FOR TO MEET THAT TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO KOLEJKA. WITH REGARD TO. AND WE GROWTH THAT THAT WAS YOU KNOW BASED ON AVAILABLE RESEARCH THAT WE HAD AT THE PUMP BUT- AND I WOULD JUST ARE YOU SAYING THAT THE LOWER NOT BASED ON A VERY. READ YOU JUST WANT TO WEAR OF TO YOU AND BOTH DEFERRAL. ENDED ROOM GROWTH BASED ON A VERY REYES. AT WHICH SAYING. YES IT TOOK AN IN TYPICAL YEAR WE WILL. WE WOULD FIND THE ME CALL AND THAT IT CAN BE FOR THAT YEAR SO. THAT THE CALL IT WAS COMPUTER. FOR- YOU KNOW THAT ONE POINT TWO TRAINER RECALL IT PREVIOUS YEAR. BUT FOR TWENTY ONE OH SOME HEN I WHEN THEY'RE WENT THE CALL RIGHT TERMS. OF RECOMMENDING. ALL RIGHT WELL I THINK IT THEY'RE JUST TO UNDERSTAND THE CHOI OF THE THREE TOGETHER. AND IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE SAYING THE CALL WAS ON A FORMULA YOU RECOMMENDED JUST. THE MINIMUM OF WHAT THE FORMULA PROVIDED AND THE OTHER A POLICY CHOICE IN HOW MUCH TO PUT. WELL I THINK THE PRIORITY- FOR THE ADMINISTRATION AT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WISE. YOU KNOW TO HELP POVIDE IMMEDIATE NEEDED RESOURCES FOR OUR STUDENTS ARE VULNERABLE DURING CONGRESS NINETEEN. AND THEN TO ALSO TRY TO COUNTER SOME OF THE WOMAN DECLINED BUT WE'RE- YOU KNOW THAT WERE SAYING FROM EARLY EVIDENCE RIGHT NOW. SO AND YOU KNOW I THINK ANOTHER ONE OF OUR PRIORITIES WAS. SIGNIFICANT PAY DOWN OF THE DEFERRALS FROM THE TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE AMOUNTING TO TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO AMOUNT SO I WOULD SAY THE ALL THREE OF THOSE WERE KIND OF GUIDING GUIDING PRINCIPLES THAT WE ARE WORKING ON THEM FOR THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE BUDGET WE'LL GET TO THIS DURING THE GREAT RECESSION. WE HAVE A SEPARATE ITEM ON THE STUDENT SUPPORT AND SO WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT I'M TRYING TO GLOBAL SURE LET YOU TRYING ADDRESS WHAT THE CHOICE ARE. WERE IN FRONT OF AND ARE IN FRONT US TO WHAT OUR TRYING TO. IT IN ME JUST A BEFORE WE MOVE ON TO ANOTHER SUBJECT IS THE ONLY- HAVE A COMMENT ON. THIS EXCHANGE. AND ANYONE. YES SO THE YOU ASKED ABOUT. CAN YOU GO CAN YOU PAY BE. THE CALL OF WHAT'S IN PRICING YEAH ANSWERS ABSOLUTE YES OF SUCH CARE HAS. YOU KNOW THAT THAT ABILITY- AND IS DONE NOW IN THE PAST PROVIDE. OF HIGHER YOU KNOW HOW AMOUNT THAN WHAT YOU KNOW IS OUT. FOR A PRICE INDEX- AND AN IN SOME TIME SOMETIMES- LET'S SEE FROM. ADDITIONAL BASE AUG. NANI'S OF A- FACE INCREASE THAT GIVES. A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY IN HOW THEY USE THAT MONEY. I DID WANT TO MENTION YOU'VE YOU'VE HEARD THIS ALREADY DID WANT TO MENTION THAT ACTUALLY THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES A HIGHER COLA. FOR K. TWELVE THREE K. TWELVES LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA WHICH IS THEIR EQUIVALENT OF A PORTION AND IT'S THE GOVERNOR AND I CASE PROVIDES A ONE POINT FIVE PERCENT. AS WELL AS A MAKE UP COLOUR CATCHER COLE AFFORD REPRESENTING THE CURRENT YEAR SO COMBINED IT WOULD SO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSING THREE POINT EIGHT FOUR PERCENT. OF THE COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENTS FOR K. TWELVE'S A LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA. AND THEN YOU KNOW AS YOU PART ONE JUST ONE POINT 5% FOR A COMMUNITY COLLEGES SO THAT SOMETHING LEGISLATURE. SHOULD KEEP IN COULD SHOULD ABOUT KEEPING MY IS THIS. KIND OF DIFFERENT. OF WHAT YOU WANT IS THERE A USER BASE FOR- AND IF AND IF THE LEGISLATURE WANTS TO PROVIDE MORE YOU TO TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT. WHAT APRIL AND MAY REVENUES LOOK LIKE WHAT PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT LOOKS LIKE AND MAKE THAT DECISION AT THAT POINT AS I MENTIONED EARLIER AS WELL THERE SOME OPPORTUNITIES TO TAKE SOME. MONEY THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSING. SOME ONGOING PROPOSALS AND PERHAPS REPURPOSE THAT TOWARD A HIGHER CALLISTO LEGISLATURE HAS ALL SORTS OF OPTIONS ERE TO DISCUSS. AND THINK ABOUT AND THEN. I'M JUST GOING TO KEEP GOING TO ALL THE IS. BECAUSE ONE OF THE OTHER ISSUES THAT TIES TO THIS IS THE FOR STATE. AND WHEN THE- OF FEDERAL STIMULUS CAME AND FOR K. THROUGH TWELVE. R. IT WAS NOT OFFSET IN ANY WAY IT WAS JUST VIEWED AS COMPLEMENTARY TO WHAT WAS IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WHEN THE STIMULUS CAME IN. FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND HIGHER EDUCATION. THEY WERE NOT BROUGHT BACK TO THE LEVEL. THAT THEY WERE BEFORE IN THE STATEMENT WAS MADE IN THE OVERALL BUDGET HEARING THAT THE STIMULUS WOULD MAKE UP THE DIFFERENCE SO AS WE HAVE JUST BEEN TALKING IT DOESN'T GO BACK ON THEIR BASE WITH THE DEFERRALS ARE PAID OFF. BUT THE STIMULUS IS VIEWED AS THE THING THAT OUR COURT WILL RELIEVE SOME OF THE PRESSURE PRESSURE IS THERE AN ANALYSIS BY FINANCE ANALYST AT OHIO. ON WHERE THE STIMULUS WILL GO IN RELATION TO WHAT'S RECOMMENDED IN THIS BUDGET HOW DO THEY FIT TOGETHER I HAVE FINANCE COULD YOU SPEAK TO THAT. AND THEN IN OUR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. I THINK SPECIFICALLY WITH REGARD TO- THIS BUDGET AND THAT THE SECOND WAVE- FEDERAL FUNDING THAT HAS BEEN COMING IN- DOCUMENT AFTER THE- AFTER WE DEVELOPED THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET- AND SO WE- OF COURSE BE LIKE BACK IN AT IN OREGON SAID THAT AS PART OF OUR MAY REVISION PROCESS BUT- WE DEVELOP TO THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WITHOUT THE FULL KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT THE SECOND ROUND OF TROUBLE. THANK YOU HAVE A PRO STATEMENT ON WHAT YOU'VE LEARNED ABOUT IT SINCE THE MONTH SINCE IT WAS APPROVED AND HOW IT MIGHT FIT. TOGETHER TO ACHIEVE RECOMMENDED. AT THE TIME WE DO NOT HAVE A BUT FORMAL STATEMENT ON HOW. DON'T GET TOGETHER AT A AS AS WE LEARN MORE THAT THE FEDERAL FUNDING IN AND WORK TOWARD THE MACRON RIGHT A WORK BY. WITH YOU IN STAFF- TAKING A OUR UNDERSTAND AND CERTAINLY WILL COMMUNICATE IT AS PART OF MAJOR VERSION. AND THEN L. TO HAVE A CALM ON THIS. YEAH THAT'S- ONE OF THE- MAJOR THEME. OF OUR- ANALYSIS ON FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND IN K. TWELVE EDUCATION IS OF THAT THE ADMINISTRATION DIDN'T HAVE THE BENEFIT OF KNOWING ABOUT THIS A SECOND ROUND OF. FEDERAL RELIEF FUNDING IT ARRIVED JUST AFTER CHRISTMAS AND IF IT IS A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY AND IT'S SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY FOR INSTITUTIONS FOR THE COLLEGES THEMSELVES FOR- TO FOUR EXTRAORDINARY COSTS AND REVENUE LOSSES RELATED TO THE PANDEMIC AND IS ALSO MONEY FOR A AS A PASSED THROUGH DIRECTLY TO STUDENTS. THROUGH FINANCIAL AID GRANTS FEDERALLY FUNDED SO- COMBINES BETWEEN THIS SPRING TWENTY TWENTY MONEY THE CARES ACT MONEY AND THEN THE MONEY THAT'S JUST ARRIVING NOW AT THE COLLEGES ABOUT TWO BILLION DOLLARS- ABOUT ONE POINT FOUR BILLION OF THAT IS FOR CAN BE USED FOR INSTITUTIONAL MONEY IN ABOUT SIX HUNDRED MILLION NEEDS TO BE USED AS A PASS THROUGH TO STUDENTS. SO THIS IS SOMETHING WE'LL WE'LL TALK ABOUT MORE AS WE GO THROUGH THE AGENDA BUT YOU KNOW IN LIGHT OF THIS THIS NEW MONEY- TO KIND OF EVALUATE THE US THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL FOR STATE FUNDED URGENCY. FINANCIAL AID GRANTS. WE ABOUT THE NEED FOR- FOR OUR- TOOL- THAT'S GOING TO COME UP WITH ONLINE TO. ARE LIGHT OF. ALL THIS NEW FOR MONEY THAT'S COMING AND FACT PROFESSOR DEVELOPMENT GIVEN THAT- FEDERAL RELIEF MONEY CAN BE USED FOR ALL THREE OF THOSE THINGS THE GRANTS FOR STUDENTS OUR ONLINE. TOOLS ONLINE INFRASTRUCTURE IN PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOR AND THEN. ONE COMMENT AND IT CAN BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION WHATEVER THIS AND ALSO SYSTEM IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING. AND IF SOMEBODY KNOWS TO CORRECT ME CORRECT ME. THAT THE FEDERAL STIMULUS THERE WAS A PROHIBITION ABOUT IT GOING TO UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS AND THE STATE ASSISTANCE DOES NOT HAVE THAT PROHIBITION SO. IS THERE GOING TO HAVE TO BE SOME CORRELATION TO MAKE SURE IF THERE'S A NEED HERE TO BE MET BUT IT'S THEIR SOME INSURANCE DENTAL BE MET FROM THE STATE LEVEL BECAUSE OF THE FEDERAL PROHIBITION. I DON'T KNOW WHETHER FINANCER LA. A ONE RESPOND. I CAN I CAN ADDRESS THAT. SO THE AND ACTUALLY LOOK BY CHANCE OFFICE MY CHINA AS WELL BUT YEAH ORIGINAL THE CARES ACT MONEY THEM FROM WAS NOT TO BE USED FOR UNDOCUMENTED. STUDENTS BUT THE ACTUALLY THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES CHANCELLOR OAKLEY LED THIS LAWSUIT AGAINST THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ULTIMATELY WON SAID THAT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE ALLOWED AND HAVE USED CARES ACT MONEY FOR UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS EMERGENCY AID AND. THEY ARE USING OR WILL BE USING. HE- THE LATEST ROUND OF MONEY THAT KIND OF WINTER. TWENTY THEN I SHOULD PROBABLY ASK THE REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE IF SHE WANTS TO TAKE A VICTORY LAP ABOUT THAT LAWSUIT. WE'VE DEFINITELY WON'T GLOW BUT- WE'RE GLAD I DID THAT- THIS LAWSUIT WAS. I. N. ENABLED US TO SERVE UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS AND THOSE THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN LEFT OUT BY THE CHARISMATIC AND WE'RE AND OPERATING UNDER THE SAME PROVISIONS. PROVIDING THE SAME GUIDANCE TO COLLEGES THAT THEY MAY USE THAT RESOURCE SAYS IN THE STIMULUS- ON ALL THE STUDENTS THAT WE SERVE AND SO AGAIN THAT'S THE GUIDANCE WE PROVIDED TO OUR COLLEGES. THANK YOU ANNEMASSE FINANCE A IT WAS MENTIONED IN ONE OF THE PREVIOUS THINGS THAT THAT SOME OF THE BUDGET ITEMS ARE ARE BASED ON MULTIPLE YEAR ROLLING. AVERAGES AND I WANT TO ASK ABOUT THE FUNDING FORMULA CHANGE OF A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO COUPLE BUDGET YEARS AGO. WHERE THERE WAS A MAJOR FUNDING FORMULA CHANGE FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND CREATED WINNERS AND LOSERS AND A LOT OF THE LOSERS HAPPEN TO BE IN MY SENATE DISTRICT. AND SO THE LEGISLATURE TOGETHER WITH THE GOVERNOR DID A HOLD HARMLESS. FOR THE LOSERS IN THE WHOLE AREA AND IT IS A FISCAL CLIFF THEY WILL GO OVER IF THE HOLD HARMLESS IS NEVER RENEWED. AND IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT PAUL THAT WAS SUMS RELATIVELY SMALL. PORTION OF THE TOTAL- OF COMMUNITY COLLEGE. THAT NOW THE ANGELES CA COLLEGE SO. IS ON THE VERGE OF MOVING INTO THE CATEGORY THAT IS. THE SORT OF PROTECTED BY THE HOLD HARMLESS. I WAS GONNA IT AND BECAUSE OF THE ROLLING YEARS IT'S PROTECTED FOR THIS YEAR AND THEN PROTECTED FOR NEXT YEAR. I WAS GONNA ASK FINANCE IF THEY CONTEMPLATED ANY LONG TERM FIX FOR THIS- IN THE NEAR FUTURE RATHER THAN JUST TO IN THIS YEAR BY YEAR. SHAHRABAD MASHONALAND WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO AS YOU KNOW THERE THERE'S A THREE YEAR ROLLING AVERAGE- IN THE BASE ALLOCATION OF THE FUNDING FORMULA WHICH IS. NOT PART OF THE FUNDING FORMULA THAT IS MORE GEARED TOWARD INVOLVEMENT. IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THERE IS ALSO A THREE YEAR ROLLING AVERAGE IMPLEMENTED IN THE EAST XFL ALLOCATION. ONE OF THE FUNDING FORMULA IS MEANT TO YOU KNOW PROVIDE A PHYSICAL INCENTIVES FOR DISTRICTS THAT ARE YOU KNOW EDGED ACHIEVING CERTAIN WILL- SUCCESS METRICS. ON A NEW NOTE THE NOTE. WHOLE HARMLESS WAS IMPLEMENTED IN THE TWO EIGHT BUDGET I WITH THE ACT MAN ON THE UNDER FORMULA- IT AT THAT A HOLD HARMLESS Q. THREE TWENTY FOUR IT'S GOING YEAR. YOU KNOW THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE ARE PAYING A LOT OF ATTENTION TO AND ARE MONITORING ON. HEY WE DON'T HAVE A SPECIFIC PROPOSAL FOR IT RIGHT NOW IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET BUT- YOU KNOW THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE ARE PAYING CLOSE ATTENTION TO TOWN WOULD LOVE TO SEE A SPECIFIC PROPOSAL THAT JUST PUT THIS OUT OF. ITS MISERY AND THE- THE OTHER THING IS I GET. UNFORTUNATELY I KNOW HOW FINANCED. AND IF YOU FIXED IT FOR THE OUT YEARS YOU WOULD- ADD A LITTLE TO THE BASE AND HAD A LITTLE TO THE HOUSE HERE DEFICIT AND IT'S EASY TO JUST DO THIS YEAR BY YEAR AND NOT GET TO PROJECTING A DEFICIT BUT IT APPEARS TO BE SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO BE DONE AT SOME POINT. SO IT SHOULD JUST BE DONE IT IN MY TECH- BEFORE I MOVED TO MY LAST QUESTION DOES THE L. A. O. HAVE ANY COMMENT ON THIS. YEAH ALL COMMENTS ON THE ON THE FORMULA ITSELF- THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE MENTIONED THAT YOU KNOW IT HAS THREE COMPONENTS ENROLLMENT AND ENROLLMENT WAS WAS THE MAIN FEATURE OF THE OLD FORMULA BUT THE NEW FORMULA ADDS TO ADDITIONAL COMPONENTS. AND IF IT DOES THOSE COMPONENTS- TEND TO FAVOR CERTAIN DISTRICTS- ONE OF THE COMPONENTS IS A SUPPLEMENTAL FACTOR FOR. DISTRICTS SERVING HIGH HIGHER NUMBERS OF STUDENTS WHO ARE IDENTIFIED AS AS FINANCIALLY NEEDY AND THE OTHER IS- IS BASED ON OUTCOMES STUDENT SUCCESS OUTCOMES SO DISTRICTS THAT ARE SERVING RELATIVELY HIGHER INCOME STUDENTS. DON'T DO AS WELL- AND THEN DISTRICTS OR SERVING RELATIVELY YOU KNOW HIGHER AMOUNTS OF LOWER INCOME STUDENTS AND YOU ALSO HAVE- BECAUSE OF THE SUCCESS COMPONENT A CERTAIN DISTRICTS ARE CAN TO SERVE OLDER STUDENTS STUDENTS THAT MIGHT NOT BE THERE ARE TO TRANSFER OR GET SOME SKILLS CERTIFICATE THEY MIGHT BE THERE FOR OTHER REASONS OF THOSE DISTRICTS- DON'T DO AS WELL- DIDN'T TEND TO DO AS WELL. UNDER THE NEW FORMULA SO. DEPARTMENT FOR DID MENTION THAT THE HOLD HARMLESS RUNS FOR ANOTHER COUPLE YEARS I THINK IT'S SCHEDULED TO RUN THROUGH TWO THOUSAND TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR AND- THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THE LEGISLATURE WILL WANT TO YOU KNOW CONTINUES TAKE A LOOK AT AS IT SHOULD. WITH ANY FORMULA IS WHETHER THE FORMULA IS DOING WHAT IT SHOULD DO ACHIEVING ITS OUTCOMES AND- AND NOT KIND OF NECESSARILY PENALIZING DISTRICTS- FOR CERTAIN FACTORS THAT MIGHT BE UNDER CONTROL MIGHT NOT BE UNDER THEIR CONTROL. TAKING INTO ACCOUNT HOWEVER- YOU KNOW COSTS AND WHAT IT COSTS TO REALLY STIR SERVICE STUDENT CREATE INCENTIVES FOR DISTRICTS TO SERVE STUDENTS BETTER. THANK YOU AND I ONE LAST QUESTION A MASCOT OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE IN. IT MIGHT SEEM ESOTERIC. BUT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT THERE WAS A LAW THAT SET THE GOAL OF 75% FULL TIME FACULTY AND 25% PART TIME FACULTY WITHIN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM. AND THIS WAS DONE- BECAUSE OF A FOR A NUMBER OF BELIEFS BUT ALAS ED JUNKS AND MORE PERMANENT. IN TERMS OF THE- WORKFORCE IN N. SO IT SEEMS THAT IN THE THIRTY TWO YEARS SINCE THAT BILL WAS ENACTED IT IT MOVES UP MOVES DOWN MOVES UP MOVES DOWN THAT GOAL IS NEVER BEEN REACHED IT'S BEEN THIRTY TWO YEARS. DOES THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE HAVE ANY ACTIONS IT CONTEMPLATES TO ADDRESS THAT ISSUE. YOU CENTER LAND FOR THAT QUESTION- THERE IT WHAT YOU WERE REFERRING TO IS THE FACULTY OBLIGATION NUMBER THE FACULTY OBLIGATION NUMBER SET IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT AS YOU MENTIONED ESSENTIALLY TOOK A POINT IN TIME. AND SAID THAT ANY DISTRICT ARE COULD NOT FALL BELOW THEIR CURRENT FACULTY LEVELS THAT WERE ESTABLISHED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT AND THEN IT BUILDS UP FROM THERE ALLOWING FOR ADJUSTMENTS- WHEN IT DISTRICT- IS SERVING FAR FEWER STUDENTS OR WHEN THERE ARE DEFICITS WITHIN- ARE STATES BUDGETS AS WE'VE SEEN DURING THE GREAT RECESSION AND IN OTHER PERIODS. AND SO- FOR A FEW YEARS THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE HAS. HELLO WORKER. TO CONVENE AND DISCUSS THIS VERY COMPLEX TOPIC- WITH THE GOAL OF SUPPORTING OUR FACULTY BUT ALSO SUPPORTING THE FISCAL HEALTH AND RESILIENCY OF OUR COLLEGES THAT THEY MAY SERVE. STUDENTS OF CALIFORNIA- ULTIMATELY YOU WHERE WE OFTEN LAND IS A NEED FOR GREATER INVESTMENT IN FULL TIME FACULTY AND AN ONGOING COMMITMENT FOR FUNDS FROM THE STATE AND THESE ARE COMMITMENTS AND ENDS IN EMPLOYEES. OF OUR COLLEGES THAT CAN'T BE FUNDED ON A ONE TIME BASIS AND SO ANY REFORMS REALLY DO LOOK AT. LONG TERM- INVESTMENTS IN RESOURCES SO THAT WE CAN SUPPORT OUR CONTROL I'M GETTING PRESSURED TO INTRODUCE A BILL ON THIS BECAUSE IT'S JUST BEEN GOING ON FOR SO LONG. AND I'M OPEN TO DOING IT BUT I DON'T WANT TO REARRANGE THE DECK CHAIRS I WOULD. LIKE TO HAVE A SENSE. THAT THERE'S A PER TO GO AND MANAGE A PLACE. OR METHOD WHICH WE MIGHT MAKE SOME PROGRESS ON SO I WOULD HOPE TO WORK WITH YOU ON THAT AND LET ME APOLOGIZE. TO MY COLLEAGUES BECAUSE I WANTED TO WALK THEM THROUGH EVERY SINGLE MAJOR ISSUE THAT I THOUGHT EXISTED AND- I KNOW THAT WE STILL HAVE FIVE OTHER ISSUES AND WE HAVE TO MOVE ON BUT I WANT TO GIVE YOU. THE CHANCE TO ASK ANY QUESTIONS THAT DIDN'T GET PAST. NOTHING FOR MACHO BOAT. MISTER MAN I THANK YOU CARE WHERE I THINK YOU'VE COVERED MOST OF THE ISSUES VERY COMPREHENSIVELY- I JUST WANT TO STEP BACK IN EMPHASIZE THAT. YOU KNOW OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES RIGHT NOW ARE REELING WITH DECLINING ENROLLMENT- MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THEY HAVE ACROSS THE SYSTEM. LAID OFF A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF PART TIME FACULTY THEY BORROWED FROM THE RESERVES- IN AND- THE I WANT TO ECHO CHAIRMAN LEONARD'S POINT THAT. YOU KNOW WHETHER IT'S THE CALL- WEATHERS THE PARTIAL REPAYMENT OF THE DEFERRALS. WE ARE VERY CLEARLY IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET CLEARLY DE EMPHASIZES COMMUNITY COLLEGES VIS A VIS K. THROUGH TWELVE- AND THAT DIFFERENCE IS STRIKING. AND IT DOES NOT SEEM FISCALLY PRUDENT TO BE DEPRIVING THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES WHETHER IT'S THE CALL- WHETHER IT'S THE REFERRALS- IN SO I DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT HOW THIS IS LAID OUT- BUT I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THIS CONVERSATION. GIVE VERY MUCH IN IT AND I WOULD JUST CLOSE AS WELL BY SAYING. WE LAID OUT LOTS OF ISSUES THAT WE JUST HOPE WILL BE CONSIDERED IN THE MAY REVISE. OF AN AND NOW ALL ACTION TRYING TO MOVE THE HEARING. ARE ISSUE NUMBER TWO STUDENT SUPPORTS AND BASIC NEEDS. IT IS THE SAME THREE PEOPLE WITH STARK WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THANK YOU AGAIN DAM AND OUR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- SAID THAT AND I'VE MENTIONED BEFORE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IS FIRST AND FOREMOST A STUDENT FOCUSED BUDGET- THE ADMINISTRATION RECOGNIZED THE CHALLENGES FACED BY OUR STATE COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS. THERE IS ALSO THE CO IN NINETEEN PANDEMIC AND DOING RECESSION. AT THE CHALLENGES THAT LED TO AN ESTIMATED EIGHT PERCENT- DECLINING COMMUNITY COLLEGE ENROLLMENT FALL TWENTY NINETEEN TO CALL TWENTY TWENTY OF MY COLLEAGUES AT. HE DESCRIBED- THIS BUDGET DESIGN TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF STUDENTS ARE THE TRIP TIME- INTERNET AND THEY GOT BUDGET INCLUDES. BOND TO HELP ADDRESS STUDENTS ABILITY TO AFFORD COLLEGE. BASICALLY THE BUDGETING. CHILDREN FIFTEEN- FOR A BIRD FUNDING JUST GRANTS FOR STUDENTS- OF WHICH ONE HUNDRED MILLION IS PROPOSED FOR THE EARLY ACTION PACKAGE- ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION OF WHICH THIRTY EIGHT ON GOING TO ADDRESS STUDENT BASIC NEEDS. AND TWENTY MILLION ONE TIME FOR OUTREACH TO STUDENT RETURNED TO INCREASE STUDENT RETENTION AND ENROLLMENT RATES. WHICH IS ALSO PROPOSED FOR THE EARLY ACTION PACKAGE- I WANT TO NOTE HERE THAT THIS BUDGET PROVIDES ARE CONTEMPLATING ADJUSTMENT TO SEVERAL CAN YOU COLLEGE CATEGORICAL PROGRAMS. INCLUDING A MAN DAY BLOCK GRANT DISABLED STUDENTS- PROGRAMS AND SERVICES. TO OUR STUDENTS SERVICES EXTENDED OPPORTUNITY PROGRAMS AND SERVICES. THE CAMPUS CHILD CARE TAX BAILOUT AND FRIENDSHIPS. THESE COLORS TOP TOTAL ROUGHLY SIX POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN ONGOING PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND. AND WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. DELEO THE ADMINISTRATION'S FOCUS ON BASIC NEEDS INCLUDING FOOD HOUSING MENTAL HEALTH. WE FIVE IS LAUDABLE- BASIC NEEDS- WERE PROBLEM BEFORE THE PANDEMIC AND IT'S JUST GOTTEN WORSE SINCE THE PANDEMIC IT OF. THIS OF THE STATE- SO TO DATE THE STATE'S APPROACH TO ADDRESSING BASIC NEEDS REALLY IS BEEN PIECEMEAL LACKING AN OVERARCHING GOALS AND STRATEGIES IS NOT A LOT OF ONE TIME MONEY ONE TIME INITIATIVES FOR MENTAL HEALTH AND FOOD PANTRIES AND THAT SORT OF THING OVER THE YEARS. SO ALTHOUGH THE GOVERNOR SHOULD BE COMMENDED FOR HIS FOCUS- HE CONTINUES THE STATE'S UNCOORDINATED AND REALLY PIECEMEAL- APPROACH TO ADDRESSING THIS PROBLEM. FOR EXAMPLE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET DOESN'T SPECIFY HOW PROPOSALS HOW PROPOSED NEW PROGRAMS WOULD INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER OR HOW THEY'D INTERACT WITH EXISTING PROGRAMS SO COULD POTENTIALLY CREATE MORE SILOS. ON THE GOVERNOR ALSO PROVIDES ONE TIME FUNDS FOR A PURPOSE FOOD PANTRY AND HOUSING ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS THAT REALLY REQUIRES SOME ONGOING FUNDING TO BE SUSTAINABLE. THE GOVERNOR'S PROVIDES FUNDS WITHOUT ANY EXPECTATIONS IN THE EXPECTATION OF LEVELS OF SERVICE OR DESIRED OUTCOMES WHICH WE SEE AS A KIND OF FLAW IN THE PROPOSAL. WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER A DIFFERENT APPROACH AND BY CREATING OF BASIC NEEDS BLOCK GRANT UNDER SUCH AN APPROACH THE LEGISLATURE COULD USE ALL OR A PORTION OF THE PROPOSED FUNDS FOR MENTAL HEALTH TECHNOLOGY FOOD AND HOUSING AND THEN INTEGRATE EXISTING ONGOING FUNDING. OF FOUR FROM THE- CURRENT- HOUSING ASSISTANCE PROGRAM THAT THE LEGISLATURE FINDS. AND ALONG WITH THIS APPROACH THE LEGISLATURE COULD BE CLEAR ABOUT EXPECTATIONS ABOUT MINIMUM SERVICE LEVELS ABOUT DESIRED OUTCOMES FOR STUDENTS. BUT THEN GIVE FLEXIBILITY TO COLLEGES TO DECIDE HOW TO STRUCTURE THE PROGRAM AND USE THE FUNDING. TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THEIR STUDENTS- AND- A BIG PART OF THAT IS YOU HAVE THE EXPECTATIONS OF WHAT THIS MONEY IS SUPPOSED TO BE FOR- BUT THE DISTRICTS NEED TO REPORT REGULARLY ON THEIR SERVICE LEVELS SUCH AS APPOINTMENT WAIT TIMES. THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS SERVED THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS WHO FIND HOUSING WHO WERE IN DANGER OF BEING HOMELESS THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS ENROLLING IN THE STATE'S. FOOD STAMPS PROGRAM CALFRESH AND OTHER MEASURES. SO THAT'S THAT'S ONE RECOMMENDATION FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER. REALLY REDUCE THOSE SILOS AND KIND OF BE CLEAR ABOUT WHAT THE EXPECTATIONS ARE ON THE EMERGENCY FINANCIAL AID GRANTS SOMETHING WE TALKED ABOUT A BIT IN THE- IN THE PREVIOUS ISSUE THE ADMINISTRATION DID NOT OF COURSE NO ABOUT THE SECOND ROUND OF FUNDING FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WHEN DEVELOPING THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET NOW WE KNOW THAT AT LEAST TWO HUNDRED NINETY MILLION DOLLARS OF DISTRICTS KNEW. FEDERAL RELIEF FUNDS MUST BE PASSED THROUGH STUDENTS AS A PURCHASING GRANTS SO WE ENCOURAGE THE LEGISLATURE TO EVALUATE WHETHER WOULD LIKE TO ADD IN THE STORY USING STATE MONEY. TO HELP WITH THIS DECISION MAKING A LEGISLATURE COULD DIRECT THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE TO. A SURVEY COLLEGES ON THEIR PLANS FOR USING THE UPCOMING FEDERAL RELIEF FUNDS THE FUNDS ARE ABOUT TO RECEIVE OR ARE RECEIVING NOW. COLLEGES COULD BE ASKED- HOW MUCH IN FEDERAL FUNDS THEY INTEND TO PROVIDE AS EMERGENCY STUDENT AID THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS LIKELY TO RECEIVE THE STATE AND HOW MUCH ELIGIBLE STUDENTS ARE ESTIMATED TO RECEIVE. THIS INFORMATION LEGISLATURE WOULD BE IN A BETTER POSITION TO MAKE A DECISION ON WHETHER TO PROVIDE STATE FUNDED EMERGENCY STUDENT A GRASS ON TOP OF THE FEDERAL EMERGENCY. AID GRANTS. FOR EXAMPLE OF THE LEGISLATURE COULD DECIDE TO ADD TO THE FEDERAL MOUNT THIS IS MAYBE- SUMMER TERM ASSISTANCE OR DECIDED THAT FEDERAL EMERGENCY GRANTS ARE SUFFICIENT SO SIZE. AND INSTEAD REPURPOSE THE MONEY FOR OTHER PRIORITIES. SUCH AS ADDRESSING THE DEFERRED. A LIABILITIES THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT. WITH TO RETENTION AND ENROLLMENT STRATEGIES PROPOSAL THAT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET HAS ASSEMBLY SIMILAR MESSAGE TO- WHAT WE SAID ABOUT THE GOVERNOR'S ENROLLMENT- PROPOSAL WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE HOLD OFF ON APPROVING THEM THE FUNDING UNTIL THE STATE HAS A CLEAR PICTURE OF WHAT THE UPCOMING YEAR WILL. LOOK LIKE IF THERE ARE SIGNS THAT COLLEGES WILL RE OPEN THE FUNDS COULD BE PUT TO GOOD USE SO THAT COLLEGES CAN GET THE WORD OUT TO RESIDENTS THAT THAT THE RE OPENING- BUT OTHERWISE IF COLLEGES AND K. TWELVE SCHOOLS FOR THAT MATTER. STAY ONLINE FOR THE MOST PART IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO IT'S UNCLEAR HOW OUT OF REACH MONEY WOULD HELP BECAUSE THE UNDERLYING REASONS. WHY INDIVIDUALS ARE GOING TO COLLEGE WOULD STILL REMAIN THEY'D STILL BE IN PLACE. SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND NOW WILL MOVE TO THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. THANK YOU CENTER LAYERED AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. FOR TOO MANY STUDENTS FINANCES OF THE MAIN BARRIER TO ACHIEVING THEIR EDUCATIONAL GOALS WE THANK THE GOVERNOR FOR RECOGNIZING THAT COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS HAVE BEEN THE MOST AFFECTED. A POPULATION IN HIGHER EDUCATION AND WE STRONGLY SUPPORT AND INVESTMENT IN EMERGENCY GRANT RESOURCES TO ADDRESS THE MOST PRESSING NEEDS OF OUR STUDENTS. AND ENSURE THAT THIS ECONOMIC AND HEALTH CRISIS DID NOT PUT THEIR- EDUCATIONAL DREAMS ON HOLD. IMMEDIATE ACTIONS ARE KEY TO PREVENTING THE LOSS OF THE GENERATION OF LEARNERS AND TO STABILIZE OUR ENROLLMENTS. WE DO ASK HOWEVER FOR CONSIDERATION OF AN APPROACH THAT IS MORE FLEXIBLE AND INCLUSIVE OF A BROADER GROUP OF STUDENTS WOULD DESPERATELY NEED ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE INCLUDING PART TIME STUDENTS DISPLACED WORKERS. AND OUR LOWEST INCOME STUDENTS- IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THESE FUNDS WILL BE DISTRIBUTED BY FINANCIAL AID OFFICES THAT HAVE SEEN REDUCTIONS FOR SEVERAL YEARS INCLUDING A THREE POINT SIX MILLION REDUCTION IN THIS BUDGET. THE MORE STREAMLINED THE PROCESS OF THE FASTER WE CAN ASSIST STUDENTS BUT AGAIN WE THINK THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE FOR PUTTING STUDENTS FIRST. IN THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUDGET. I WITH REGARD TO OUT REACH THE CHANCES OFFICE STRONGLY SUPPORTS AN INVESTMENT RESOURCES FOR OUT REACH ENGAGEMENT AND RE ENROLLMENT OF OUR STUDENTS. AND WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE APPROACH OUTLINED IN THE BUDGET BILL. TO MAXIMIZE OUR REGION MARKETING EFFORTS THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE WOULD CREATE STATEWIDE ENROLLMENT CAMPAIGNS THAT CAN BUILD A COHESIVE MESSAGE AND LEVERAGED ECONOMIES SCALE. THAT SMALLER GRANTS- MAY NOT ALLOW AND TO ALLOW THESE DOLLARS STRETCH FURTHER. DISTANCES OFFICE WILL BE READY TO LAUNCH OUTRAGE CAMPAIGNS BASED ON TESTING MESSAGES- THROUGH AN APPROACH THAT REACHES MANY AUDIENCES IN FAR CORNERS OF THE STATE IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES. THE APPROACH WOULD ALLOW US TO ACT FAST GAINING ACCESS INTO MARKETS THAT INDIVIDUALIZED GRADES MAY NOT. AND THE INVESTMENTS WOULD PREVENT- YOU WOULD PRESENT AN OPPORTUNITY FOR MORE INTENTIONAL FOCUS ON PROSPECTIVE STUDENTS ARE HARDER TO ATTRACT BUT ULTIMATELY NEED ACT LITTLE AT EQUITABLE EDUCATIONAL. ACCESS MORE THAN EVER. I WAS REFERRED DEVELOP A CENTRIC APPROACH TO BASIC NEEDS WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE IN THE ADMINISTRATION. TO INTEGRATE- CALFRESH OUTREACH AND INCREASE ENROLLMENT AND THAT PROGRAM WE ARE PREFERRED. TO LEVERAGE THE FLEXIBILITY PROVIDED AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL- TO ENROLL MORE STUDENTS IN THIS IMPORTANT FOOD AID AND FORTY FIVE PARTNERSHIPS WITH THEIR COUNTIES SO THAT THESE RESOURCES ARE WIDELY UTILIZED. LASTLY I AS THE SENATE CONSIDERS APPROACHES TO BASIC NEEDS WE ASSET LONG TERM SOLUTIONS BY WAY OF CAL GRANT REFORM- THAT PROVIDES MORE AID TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD AND WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR PASSENGER SHIP IN THIS AREA. COMMUNITY COLLEGES SERVE OVER 70% OF CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC HIGHER ED STUDENTS AS A RESULT OUR STUDENTS REPRESENT AN OPPORTUNITY FOR AN EQUITABLE. A RECOVERY FOR THE MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIANS AND WE BELIEVE THAT SUPPORTING THEIR CORE NEEDS IS A FIRST STEP THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MY TO GIVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO MY COLLEAGUES TO ASK THE FIRST QUESTION SHE DOESN'T. CENTER. CHAU BOAT DO YOU HAVE A QUESTION. HAVE ATTENDED WOULD YOU TURN MICROPHONE ON PLEASE. FOLLOW. I JUST HAD A QUESTION I JUST WANT FOR CURVE PURPOSES- WITH REGARDS THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FUNDING- THE CCC- NOTED THAT THE FUNDING WAS DISTRIBUTED TO FIFTEEN COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT IN TWENTY SEVEN INDIVIDUAL COLLEGES. AND THERE WAS A REPORT- THAT WAS SUBMITTED TO THE LEGISLATURE IN OCTOBER TWENTY TWENTY SPECIFYING HOW THESE MONIES WERE. WERE SPENT MY QUESTION IS. AM I TO UNDERSTAND THAT NOT EVERY SINGLE COMMUNITY COLLEGE RECEIVE A FUNDING FOR BEHAVIOR HEALTH PREVENTIVE HEALTH PLAN IS TO HOST A QUESTION TO SET TO THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. YES I GUESS IT WOULD BE TO CHESTER'S OFFICE YES PLEASE THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR BO GAS- YOU ARE CORRECT TODAY GRANT THAT WAS PROVIDED- IN THE THROUGH THOSE ONE TIME DOLLARS FOR MENTAL HEALTH. UNFORTUNATELY WE'RE NOT ABLE TO REACH EVERY DISTRICT IN EVERY COLLEGE THAT WAS INTERESTED IN PROVIDING THOSE SERVICES- AS- CAMPUS OF OUR SYSTEM OF OUR SIZE DID HAVE A LOT OF INTEREST. BUT WITH LIMITED FUNDS- THEY WERE ONLY AVAILABLE FOR. THOSE COLLEGES THAT MET CERTAIN CRITERIA- HOWEVER I WOULD NOTE THAT- WHICH IN OUR SYSTEM BUDGET REQUEST- THAT WAS CREATED WITH. SYSTEM LEADERS AND STAKEHOLDERS WE DID INCLUDE A REQUEST FOR ON GOING FUNDS FROM PROP SIXTY THREE FOR THIS VERY PURPOSE SO THAT WE CAN OFFER MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND ALL OF OUR COLLEGES AND. MAKE IT AVAILABLE TO ALL THE STUDENTS WE SERVE. IS THAT. WHICH TO QUESTION YES BUT I DO HAVE A FOLLOW UP QUESTION WITH THAT SO MOVING FORWARD WITH THE CURRENT BUDGET- ARE WE- ASSURING THAT EVERY SINGLE COMMUNITY COLLEGE RECEIVES FUNDING FOR BEHAVIOR HEALTH. SHOULD THIS MOVE FORWARD- IN THE BUDGET WE WOULD- STRUCTURE THE WAY THAT WE RELEASE DOLLARS TO DISTRICTS AND COLLEGES SO THAT EVERY- EVERY COLLEGE DOES HAVE ACCESS TO THESE FUNDS. AND I'M SORRY ONE MORE QUESTION- NO GO AHEAD I THINK YOU'RE A FOR THE- SO JUST SO THAT I UNDERSTAND. WHAT SORT OF CRITERIA WERE YOU LOOKING FOR- COMMUNITY COLLEGE HAD TO MEET IN ORDER TO RECEIVE THE FUNDING FOR BEHAVIOR HEALTH. WE CURRENTLY DON'T HAVE A CRITERIA ESTABLISHED UNDER SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD DEVELOP OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF MONTHS AS THIS. PROPOSAL MOVES FORWARD WE LIKELY WOULD USE A COMBINATION OF ONES THAT. I COUNTY THAT FULL TIME EQUIVALENT STUDENTS THAT WE HAVE IN SOME OTHER COMMUNITY FACTORS BASED ON AVAILABLE DATA. RIGHT THANK YOU OKAY THANK YOU SENATOR MEANT. THANK YOU CHAIR LAYERED- HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE PARDON OF FINANCE- VIEW ALL DONE AN ANALYSIS OF WHERE WE ARE GOING TO BE RECEIVING FEDERAL FUNDS INCLUDING WITH THE CURRENT STIMULUS PACKAGE THAT I DON'T THINK IT'S BEEN SIGNED YET- AND WHERE THAT'S GOING TO FILL IN SOME OF OUR PARTICULAR COMMUNITY COLLEGE NEEDS AS EXPRESSED. IN THIS BUDGET. THE TO THE DEPARTMENT INVESTED APARTMENT FINANCE. CAN OUR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- AGAIN AS I MENTIONED EARLIER- THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET DOES NOT REFLECT- THE- MOST RECENT ROUND OF FEDERAL RELIEF FUNDS- BUT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE WILL CERTAINLY TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION AS PART OF THE MAY REVISION- AND I THINK WE'LL HAVE BEEN WORKING GIVEN YOUR STATUS. AS WE GET A MORE. FLESHED OUT UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT OF THOSE FEDERAL FUNDS AND WHAT THEIR FOR THE END IS A CORRECT THAT THERE IS SIGNIFICANT FEDERAL FUNDING. BOTH WITH THE PAST IN THIS PACKAGES AND ALSO ANTICIPATED IN THIS ONE FOR. AMERICANS YOU NEED A MENTAL HEALTH. AGAIN THAT'S FOR DEPARTMENT FINANCE IT. OKAY FANTASTIC I'M NOT A HUNDRED. GOD OKAY- YEAH I DON'T HAVE THE SPECIFICS I KNOW THAT THERE IS A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY PROVIDED ESPECIALLY IN THE NEWEST ROUND OF FUNDING- BUT I CAN'T COMMENT ON ON ON THE SPECIFICS OF WHAT'S INCLUDED IN IN THE STIMULUS AND THAT'S WHAT WE'LL LOOK FORWARD TO DISCUSSING WITH YOU AFTER THE NAY REVISED THANK YOU THANK YOU CENTER AND THEN I'M GONNA CLOSE WITH TWO QUESTIONS IN THE FIRST ONE IS FOR FINANCE. OF THE L. A. O. REPRESENT RECOMMENDED A BLOCK GRANT FOR THESE TO BETTER COORDINATE THEM AND MAYBE EVEN STRETCH THE MONEY A LITTLE ABOUT WHAT YOU RESPONSE. TO THE L. A. O.'S PROPOSAL. MANY OF THE DAY FROM THE BANK I THINK THAT THAT'S COMING WILL WIN THE TAKE IT A GENERATION AS PART OF THE MAYOR VISION PROCESS AND ENGAGE IN FUTURE. ON THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. DOES INCLUDE A HUNDRED MILLION PER BASIC NEEDS BUT UP TO THE SPECIFIC- PROPOSAL FROM THE LEGISLATIVE OFFICE I KNOW IT IS THAT ANALYSTS OFFICE THINK WHAT HAPPY TO TAKE I AND CONSIDER. AND ENGAGE IN FUTURE CONVERSATION ON. GREAT THAT'S A GOOD DIRECTION AND THEN MY LAST QUESTION IS. DID YOU MENTION SIX POINT ONE MILLION. DOLLARS FOR- THE COST OF WITH AND JOSH. FOR PER. IN THIS BY YOU WHAT IN BUT SOMETHING SUTTER. I THINK PART TIME FACULTY HOURS APPOINTED MESA. WHY DID YOU NOT EXTEND THE COLON TO THOSE ITEMS THAT YOU EXTENDED TO OTHER ITEMS. SURE SAID THAT THE COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENTS PROVIDED THAT CERTAIN CATEGORICAL PROGRAMS AND KEEPING WITH- THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROVIDES AT A COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT TO THE CATEGORICAL PROGRAMS THAT. HAVE TRADITIONALLY RECEIVED A- COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT AND IN PREVIOUS BUDGET. BUT I MEAN IT'S SO A MESS A TRADITIONALLY DOES NOT HAVE A COST OF LIVING INCREASE IN THERE FOR EVERY YEAR THEY DON'T GET AN INCREASE IN EVERY YEAR THEY HAVE TO CUT THEIR SERVICES BY THE AMOUNT OF INFLATION. IS THERE A REASON WHY YOU HAVEN'T CONSIDERED MOVING THEM INTO. COST OF LIVING COVERAGE- I THINK WAS PUT PERSPECTIVE IT CURRENT I THINK WE WENT WITH THE- TRADITIONAL. CATEGORICAL GRANTS TO HAVE RECEIVED A COLA- IF YOU HAVE THAT THE SPECIFIC PROGRAMS LIKE. WE ARE HAPPY TO TAKE INTO CONSDERATION- OTHER CATEGORICAL PROGRAMS ON HOW TO TAKE THAT REQUEST BACK. I THINK YOU SHOULD JUST TAKE A LOOK AT THAT HEADED TOWARD THE MAY REVISE. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS BEFORE WE MOVE ON. AND WE'RE GONNA MOVE TO ISSUE NUMBER THREE. ONLINE EDUCATION IT'S OUR SAME THREE PANELISTS WILL START WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THANK YOU CHAIR- ALTHOUGH THE ADMINISTRATION EXPECTS AN EVENTUAL RETURN TO PRIMARILY IN PERSON INSTRUCTION I COMMUNITY COLLEGES THE PANDEMIC YOU'VE MADE IT CLEAR THAT ONLINE EDUCATION IS VIABLE. ADMINISTRATION OFFICE THESE ONLINE EDUCATION AS AN EFFECTIVE METHOD OF INCREASING ACCESS TO THE COLLEGES PARTICULARLY WITH RESPECT TO NONTRADITIONAL STUDENTS. AS SUCH THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES NEW PROPOSAL DESIGNED TO SUPPORT ONLINE EDUCATION INTO THE FUTURE. AND THEIR WEAPONS EARLIER THE COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT FUNDING IS PROVIDED CONTINGENT UPON COMMUNITY COLLEGES IMPLEMENTING POLICIES TO MAINTAIN ONLINE COURSES AND PROGRAMS AT A LEVEL THAT IS 10% UP TEN PERCENTAGE POINTS HIGHER. THAN TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN LEVELS BECAUSE THE COLLEGES HAVE ALREADY SHIFTED TO PROVIDING EDUCATION THAT IS ALMOST COMPLETE THE ONLINE AS A RESULT OF THE PANDEMIC. ADMINISTRATION BILLS COME CONFIDENT THAT THIS GOAL IS READILY ACHIEVABLE. IN ADDITION THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDE TEN POINT SIX MILLION TO SUPPORT THE CONTINUITY OF EDUCATION AND QUALITY DISTANCE LEARNING. INCLUDING ACCESS TO ONLINE TUTORING ONLINE COUNSELING AN ONLINE STUDENT SUPPORT SERVICES SUCH AS MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. HE'S AREAS OF NEED WERE IDENTIFIED AT THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. MARIN FROM THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT. THE INVESTMENTS PROVIDED ON ONGOING BASIS TO HELP ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF CURRENT AND FUTURE ONLINE STUDENTS. I DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE AFTER MY CONSULTATION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WO. FIRST ALL TAKEN THE ORDER THAT YOU JUST HEARD FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE FIRST IS THE- IS THE CONDITIONFOR. COLLEGES TO ADOPT POLICIES TO PERMANENTLY BOOST ONLINE INSTRUCTION TO TEN PERCENTAGE POINTS ABOVE THEIR PRE PANDEMIC LEVELS AND TO MAKE THAT AS A- CONDITION OF. RECEIVING A COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT. YOU KNOW THIS THIS PROPOSAL. TRY SERVICES AS ARBITRARY CONTINUE TO BE FRANK GIL COASTLINE COLLEGE IN ORANGE COUNTY ALREADY. THREE PANDEMIC- WAS FOR PROVIDING A DISTANCE EDUCATION TO ABOUT 78% OF THEIR STUDENTS SO. MORE NOT SURE WHAT'S NECESSARILY DESIRABLE ABOUT BUMPING THAT UP 288% OF OTHER COLLEGES HISTORICALLY DO OF MOSTLY IN PERSON- BECAUSE THEY'RE FOCUSED ON- HANDS ON PROTECTION COLLEGE EDUCATION PROGRAMS LIKE LOS ANGELES STRAIGHT TECHNICAL COLLEGE OR COLLEGES IN RURAL AREAS- TEND NOT OFFERS MUCH ONLINE BECAUSE A LOT OF THEIR STUDENTS DON'T HAVE THAT CONNECTIVITY. TO TALK ONLINE CLASSES SO WE RECOMMEND REJECTING THIS PROPOSAL. OF THE GOVERNOR'S WE DO UNDERSTAND THE ADMINISTRATION'S DESIRE TO MAINTAIN MOMENTUM TOWARD DEVELOPING AND IMPROVING ONLINE COURSES YOU JUST HEARD THAT FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE LEGISLATURE COULD ADOPT A BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE DIRECTING THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE TO REPORT ON CAMPUSES EXPERIENCES WITH ONLINE EDUCATION SPECIALLY SINCE MARCH OF LAST YEAR. COLLEGES COULD SHARE WHAT COURSES THEY HAVE FOUND TO BE MOST SUITABLE FOR ONLINE EDUCATION PLANS FOR IMPROVING STUDENT ACCESS AND OUTCOMES AT THE LOCAL LEVEL- CAN INCLUDE AN ASSESSMENT OF THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL FACULTY PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND IT THAT'S SOMETHING THE LOOK THE CHANCES OFFICE COULD SUBMIT TO THE LEGISLATURE BY NOVEMBER TWENTY TWENTY ONE- SO THE LEGISLATURE WOULD HAVE A BETTER BASIS FOR DETERMINING HOW TO. HOW TO SUPPORT ONLINE EDUCATION AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES. IN THE COMING YEARS. WITH REGARD TO. THE ONLINE TOOLS THAT'S TEN POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS ONGOING PROPOSED FOR. ONLINE INFRASTRUCTURE AT THE COLLEGES SEVERAL YEARS AGO THE STATE BEGAN PROVIDING BASE FUNDING THAT SUBSIDIZES COLLEGES THEIR SUBSCRIPTION AND USAGE COSTS. FOR SYSTEM WIDE COURSE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS IN VARIOUS ONLINE TOOLS THAT INTEGRATE INTO THAT ONLINE COURSE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. ARE THESE TOOLS INCLUDE A PLATFORM SOFTWARE FOR STUDENTS TO MEET VIRTUALLY WITH AN ACADEMIC COUNSELOR AND ACCESS ONLINE TUTORING SESSIONS. AS A RESULT OF THE MASS MIGRATION TO ONLINE LAST MARCH USAGE RATES INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY THROUGHOUT THE SYSTEM RESULTING IN HIGHER SUBSCRIPTION AND SERVICE COSTS. OF FOR THE SYSTEM OFFICE WHICH IS RECEIVING STATE MONEY FOR THIS PURPOSE OUR CHANCES OFFICE HAS RECENTLY NOTIFIED COLLEGES THAT ABSENT ADDITIONAL STATE FUNDING THEY'RE GOING TO NEED TO SHIFT SOME COSTS TO COLLEGES IN THE BUDGET YEAR AND SO THAT TEN POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS OF ITS PROPOSED. COULD SUBSIDIZE COLLEGES FOR ONLINE TOOLS SUCH AS THE TUTORING PLATFORM AND SERVICES AND SUBSCRIPTIONS TO TELEHEALTH SERVICES AMONG OTHER. AWESOME JOIN THIS PROPOSAL WILL JUST NOTED IT'S UNCLEAR HOW LONG ONLINE USAGE RATES WILL REMAIN AT THESE CURRENT ELEVATED LEVELS IF THE COLLEGES GO BACK TO MORE IN PERSON INSTRUCTION IN THE BUDGET YEAR COST PRESSURES FOR ONLINE TOOLS COULD GO DOWN SOMEWHAT OF COLLEGES ALSO HAVE FEDERAL RELIEF FUNDS THAT ARE AVAILABLE FOR JUST THIS SORT OF EXTRAORDINARY COST AND SO GIVEN THAT OUT YOUR COSTS FOR ONLINE TOOLS ARE UNKNOWN AT THIS TIME GIVEN THAT THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF FEDERAL RELIEF FUNDS THAT REMAIN AVAILABLE TO COLLEGES. WE THINK IT WOULD BE PREMATURE TO PROVIDE AN ONGOING AUGMENTATION FOR THESE ONLINE TOOLS SO WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE REJECT THE PROPOSAL CONSIDERING PURCHASING IT FOR OTHER PRIORITIES THE LEGISLATURE COULD DIRECTORS CHANCELLORS OFFICE TO REPORT SPRING NEXT YEAR TWENTY TWENTY TWO ON THE STATUS OF CAMPUS RE OPENINGS AND THAT THAT IMPLICATION IS FOR COSTS FOR THESE ONLINE TOOLS THESE ONLINE PLATFORMS AND SOFTWARE IN THIS INFORMATION WOULD HELP THE LEGISLATURE DETERMINE WHETHER AN AUGMENTATION IS NEEDED FOR. TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE FISCAL YEAR AND BEYOND. THANK YOU VERY MUCH CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. YOU SENATOR LAYERED MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE IN SPRING TWENTY TWENTY IN ORDER TO ENABLE US WITH TRANSITION TO DISTANCE LEARNING THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE HAD TO PURCHASE AN INCREASE USAGE OF SEVERAL LEARNING PLATFORMS ON COLLEGES BEHALF THIS FAST ACTING APPROACH MADE IT POSSIBLE TO TRANSITION TWO POINT ONE MILLION STUDENTS AT A HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN COLLEGES WITHIN OUR SYSTEM COMPLETELY ONLINE IN A MATTER OF WEEKS. THESE WERE UNEXPECTED COSTS THAT CANNOT EASILY BE ABSORBED INTO EXISTING BUDGETS AS THE OFTEN OUR ON GOING COST AS PLANS FOR FALL TWENTY TWENTY ONE ARE DEVELOPED WE ANTICIPATE THAT 1100% FACE TO FACE INSTRUCTION IS UNLIKELY DUE TO INCREASING INFECTION RATES AND SLOWLY IMPROVING INOCULATION RATES COLLEGES ARE LOOKING AT HYBRID OPTIONS THAT USE A BLEND OF TECHNOLOGY AND IN PERSON INSTRUCTION. TO SUSTAIN SUCH INSTRUCTION COLLEGES WILL NEED A ROBUST ONLINE INFRASTRUCTURE AND PLATFORMS INCLUDING TUTORING TOOLS TECH SUPPORT FOR FACULTY AND ADA ACCESSIBILITY RESOURCE SAYS THIS INVESTMENT WILL ALLOW SOCIAL DISTANCE EDUCATIONAL ACCESS TO STUDENTS THAT I FOUND THIS MODALITY FIT INTO THEIR BUSY SCHEDULES WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL FOR TEN POINT SIX MILLION AND AN INVESTMENT IN AN ONLINE. ECOSYSTEM THAT SERVES ALL STUDENTS IN EVERY PART OF THE STATE THE PROPOSAL ALSO RESPONDS TO THE BUDGET REQUESTS DEVELOPED IN CONSULTATION WITH JUSTIN STAKEHOLDERS BY PURCHASING THESE PLATFORMS AS A SYSTEM COMMUNITY COLLEGES LEVERAGE ECONOMIES OF SCALE AND OBTAIN SERVICES AT A SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED COST FURTHER I STATEWIDE APPROACH PREVENTS INCONSISTENCY ACROSS DISTRICTS AND EQUITABLE ACCESS. TO TECHNOLOGY SERVICES FOR STUDENTS. LASTLY WE LOOK FOR TO CAN. TO AND TO WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND LEGISLATURE ON A PROPOSAL TO BUILD THEIR ONLINE ONLINE PRESENCE AS DISCUSSIONS UNFOLD WE WILL PROVIDE DATA SUGGESTIONS AND CONSIDERATIONS SUCH AS ONES THAT INCREASE THEIR ONLINE PRESENCE. THROUGH INCREASED PARTICIPATION IN THE CALIFORNIA VIRTUAL CAMPUS COURSE EXCHANGE INSTEAD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL MOVE TO QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE LESS FOR MASS MY COLLEAGUES FIRST IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS NONE FROM CHOMBO. NO I JUST WANTED AMEND THAT BRIEFLY. TIED THE I THINK THAT- YOU WHEN WE TALK ABOUT YOU KNOW PEDAGOGICAL BRING THAT WORD UP AGAIN BUT BUT HOW WE TEACH- I THINK THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IS A REASONABLE AS AN IS NEVER IT JUST STATED IT PROVIDES IMPORTANT. ECONOMIES OF SCALE AND RESOURCES FROM MY LEARNING- I THE ONE POINT I JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE IS THAT WE'RE IN A KIND OF A UNIQUE TIME RIGHT NOW- I THINK THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM- PROBABLY WILL OPERATE BEST AS A MODE OF EXPERIMENTATION AND SO- JUST TO BE MINDFUL OF ALLOWING. EACH PARTICULAR COMMUNITY COLLEGE TO EXPERIMENT WITH ITS ITS OWN- METHODS OF LEARNING- SOME MAY WANT TO DO MORE IN PERSON SOME YOU WANT TO BE MORE ONLINE BUT I THINK NOW IS A FRUITFUL TIME TO TRY TO EXPERIMENT WITH THAT AND SO- NOT TO TRY TO MICROMANAGE TOO MUCH BUT- THAT'S A STATEMENT NOT A QUESTION AS THEY SAY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. AND THEN LET ME ASK MONICA. OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE I KNOW THAT- EVERYBODY EXCEPT I THINK THE ONLINE COLLEGES BEEN MOVED TO THE CAMPUS SYSTEM ARE COULD YOU JUST COMMENT BRIEFLY ON HOW IT'S WORKING IF THE COST SAVINGS HAVE BEEN REALIZED AND HAS IT IN FACT YOU ALLUDED TO IT BUT YOU DID NAME THE SYSTEM IN YOUR IN YOUR COMMENTS AND SO I WONDERED IF. IF YOU WOULD SPEAK TO THAT. YES THANK YOU AT THE- AT OUR COLLEGES ARE UTILIZED CANVAS- OVER THERE'S A ALMOST A YEAR- ARE YOU SAID YOU CAN BASS AND- OUR RELIANCE ON THAT PLATFORM HAS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED- WE NOW HAVE ALL SHELLS FOR ALMOST EVERY CLASS THAT IS. ABLE TO BE CONVERTED TO ONLINE PLATFORMS- AND THROUGH VERY SOON VESTMENTS THAT WE'VE MADE THIS YEAR WE'VE PROVIDED MORE TECH SUPPORT PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT SO MANY WAYS ARE YOU SEE THE GENERAL UNDERSTANDING OF THIS PLATFORM HAS SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED- AND YOU KNOW IN A WAY OF LOOKING AT AND THIS IS A SILVER LINING- OF THE PANDEMIC. THANK YOU I'M JUST INTEREST IN THAT IN A YOU CAN KEEP US POSTED- I WOULD APPRECIATE ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS. MAN WHAT'S MOVED ISSUE NUMBER FOUR WORKFORCE. I'M SORRY FOR HONESTY OHIO SILVA I'M SORRY SO WHAT HELLO JUST QUICKLY JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY SOMETHING FOR THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS SO AS YOU'VE HEARD- THE COLLEGES THE SYSTEM THE COMMITTEE COLLEGE SYSTEM OFFICES HAS ON BEHALF OF COLLEGES- PURCHASE THESE THE CAMERA SYSTEM AS YOU MENTIONED AND- MANY OF THESE ONLINE TOOLS. AND WAS ABLE HAS BEEN ABLE TO- TO GENERATE COST SAVINGS OF THAT'S- YOU KNOW THERE'S BEEN A BET BIG BENEFIT TO THE COLLEGES SINCE THE COLLEGES DON'T HAVE TO PAY- UNDER THE WAY THINGS HAVE BEEN I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY THAT UNDER OUR RECOMMENDATION. OF THE SYSTEM OFFICE COULD STILL NEGOTIATE ON BEHALF OF THE COLLEGES AND GET THAT LOWER RATE BUT THEN JUST PASS ON SOME OF THOSE COSTS TO THE COLLEGES IF IT DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY. THROUGH STATE FUNDING AS I MENTIONED THERE ARE SUFFICIENT FEDERAL RELIEF FUNDS THAT COLLEGES COULD USE TO COVER THOSE IN ADDITIONAL COSTS AND THEN THE RECOMMENDATION IS TO TAKE A LOOK AT THIS NEXT YEAR WHEN WE HAVE A LOT MORE INFORMATION ABOUT. WHAT SUBSCRIPTION COSTS AND USAGE RATES ARE. THANK YOU. AND LET ME JUST SAY BEFORE WE MOVE ON I KNOW THIS. THIS IS MUCH MORE OF AN ISSUE OVER IN EIGHT WEEKS YOU SEE WHERE. THE THERE'S A PROPOSAL FOR EVERYBODY TO MOVE TO IT AND IT'S A SOLE SOURCE THING AND ONLY IF. NOT ALL OF THEM ARE THERE AND YET TO COMMUNITY COLLEGES EXCEPT FOR MAYBE THE ONLINE HAVE TOTALLY MOVED THERE SO JUST TECHNOLOGY AT THIS MAY COME UP IN UP. IN THE HEARING WE HAVE WHEN YOU SEE. ANYTHING ELSE BEFORE I MOVE ON. MUCH MOVED ITEM FOUR WORK FORCE. SAME THREE PANELITS WILL BEGIN WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THANK YOU AGAIN DAND ALL DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- CONTINUES ITS COMMITMENT TO WORK BASED LEARNING AND HELPING STUDENTS ATTAIN OR RETAIN EMPLOYMENT AFTER FINISHING THE PROGRAMS. THIS COMMITMENT HAS BECOME EVEN MORE IMPERATIVE AT THE COPA NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS AFFECTED EVERY SECTOR OF THE STATE'S ECONOMY. AND IT'S BECAUSE RECORD HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT. TO THAT END THE BUDGET INCLUDES TWENTY MILLION ONETIME PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND TO EXPAND WORK BASED LEARNING MODELS AND FIFTEEN MILLION ONGOING PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND TALIBAN TO CALIFORNIA APPRENTICESHIP INITIATIVES. THAT ARE HAPPENING ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH L. A. O. THANK YOU JUST WANT TO MENTION THERE'S ONE OTHER PROPOSAL IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET- ON WORK BASED LEARNING IN APPRENTICESHIP AND THAT'S A COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT FOR APPRENTICESHIPS AND WE DON'T HAVE. A CONCERN WITH THAT PROPOSAL. AT ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN THE AUGMENTATION COULD HELP SUSTAIN PROGRAM OPERATIONS. SO TALK ABOUT THE OTHER APPRENTICESHIP- FOR PROPOSAL HERE THE CALIFORNIA TOWNSHIP INITIATIVE THAT'S FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS ONGOING AND THEN THE OF WORK BASED LEARNING INITIATIVE. SO WE HAVE A COUPLE OF CONCERNS WITH EXPANDING FUNDING FOR THE CALIFORNIA APPRENTICESHIP INITIATIVE THE- PROPOSALS TO TAKE IT UP TO THIRTY MILLION ONGOING YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE MOST RECENT ROUND OF GRANT AWARDS FOR. THE APPRENTICESHIP INITIATIVE IN THE PROGRAM'S BEEN AROUND FOR ABOUT FIVE YEARS NOW- DEMAND AMONG ELIGIBLE APPLICANTS FOR THESE GRANTS APPEARS TO BE. INSUFFICIENT TO FULLY UTILIZE EVEN EXISTING FUNDING LEVELS FOR THE PROGRAM AND SO WE'RE NOT SEEN AT THIS TIME ANY JUSTIFICATION FOR DOUBLING THE SIZE OF THE PROGRAM. THIS CAN IS THE LEGISLATURE. TO DATE LACKS DATA ON WHETHER APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS CREATED OF THE IN THE PAST WITH THIS WITH THESE MONIES ARE ACTUALLY BEING SUSPECTED SUSTAINED AFTER THE GRANT FUNDING ENDS AND I WE DO UNDERSTAND THAT THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE IN THE FOUNDATION FOR CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE LOOKING INTO THAT. AND WHAT HAPPENED THE FIRST SEVERAL ROUNDS OF FUNDING FOR THE PROGRAM AND TO THOSE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS. SO WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE REJECTED THE PROPOSAL FOR DOUBLING FUNDING FOR THE CALIFORNIA PENSION. SHOULD HAVE AND REPURPOSE IT FOR A HIGHER PRIORITIES SUCH AS- PROVIDING A LARGER APPORTIONMENT AUGMENTATION OR USING IT TO PAY DOWN MORE DEFERRALS. AS REGARDS TO THE WORK BASED LEARNING INITIATIVE WE WOULD NOTE THAT WORK BASED LEARNING IS ALREADY A FOCUS OF A FEW PROGRAMS OF THE LEGISLATURE FINDS. A STRONG WORK FORCE PROGRAM WHICH RECEIVES TWO HUNDRED FORTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR I HAS A FOCUS ON WORK BASED LEARNING OF GETTING STUDENTS CONNECTION WITH INDUSTRY WHILE THEY'RE STILL IN THEIR PROGRAMS WILL WORK BASED LEARNING IS ALSO A COMPONENT OF THE STATE FUNDED GUIDED PATHWAYS INITIATIVES. AND OF COURSE WORK BASED LEARNING REALLY IS APPRENTICESHIP IS A HALLMARK OF THE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM THAT THE STATE ALSO FUND SO IT'S NOT CLEAR TO US WHY A NEW SEPARATE INITIATIVE ON WORK BASED LEARNING IS NEEDED SO WE RECOMMEND REJECTING THAT PROPOSAL AND RE PURPOSING THE FUNDS FOR HIGHER PRIORITIES SUCH AS- DEFERRAL PAYDOWNS OF THE ADDITIONAL DEFERRAL PAYDOWNS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. THANK YOU VERY AND THE GOVERNOR IS PUTTING AN EMPHASIS ON WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT SUPPORT FOR SMALL BUSINESSES. CALIFORNIA ME COLLEGES ARE KEY TO THESE EFFORTS AND STAND READY TO GET CALIFORNIANS BACK TO WORK. AS A RESULT INVESTMENTS IN WORKFORCE ARE PRUDENT- ALL PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON ADDING CONTEXT ABOUT WORK BASED LEARNING WORK BASED LEARNING EXPANDS ACADEMIC AND TECHNICAL- TEACHING BEYOND THE CLASSROOM TO ACCELERATE ADVANCEMENT ALONG. CAREER PATHWAYS THE APPROACH ENGAGES INDIVIDUALS US AID WORKERS TO GAIN SPECIFIC SKILLS IN CONJUNCTION WITH RELATED CLASSROOM AND LAB INSTRUCTION IN AN INDUSTRY OR OCCUPATION. THIS APPROACH IS INNOVATIVE AND PROVIDES MANY OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE FUTURE. LASTLY AS MENTIONED A STUDY BY THE SOCIAL AND POLICY RESEARCH ASSOCIATES ANALYZING THE IMPLEMENTATION AND SUCCESS OF CALIFORNIA APPRENTICESHIP INITIATIVE IS ANTICIPATED FOR THIS SPRING THANK YOU. LET ME JUST. WHAT WERE MOVED TO QUESTIONS AND QUICKLY FOLLOW UP ON THAT THE TO FINANCE BECAUSE I WAS GOING TO ASK ABOUT THE PARTNERSHIP AND IT WAS STUDY ON THE EFFECTIVENESS BE READY IN TIME FOR YOU TO CONSIDER AS A MAY REVISE. ITEM. INTERNALLY AND I'M HAPPY TO SPEAK TO THAT- I WE DO ANTICIPATE HAVING A STUDY BY AT THE LATEST APRIL- HOPEFULLY IN TIME FOR. BOTH OF THE LEGISLATURE IN THE ADMINISTRATION TO FURTHER ANALYZE THE CALIFORNIA APPRENTICESHIP INITIATIVE AND THEN LET ME ASK THE- FINANCE DEPARTMENT. OUR WHO. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE EXISTING APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM GOES MORE TRADITIONALLY FOR THE TRADES AND OTHER THINGS AND- THE AUGMENTATION THAT'S- RECOMMENDED GOES FOR NEW THINGS. DO YOU THINK THE EXISTING ONE IS MEETING THE NEEDS AND THE IN A WAY THAT IT'S MORE IMPORTANT TO CONTRACT HAD NEW THINGS TO APPRENTICESHIP THEN BEEF UP WHAT IS BEING DONE IN THE EXISTING PROGRAM. I ANSWER THAT I THINK- JUTTING ARE ARE ARGUING IS THAT THE CURRENT FUNDSARE GOING TO BE A NEED FOR- THE CURRENT USES OF A PENSION MONEY AND WHAT THEY CURRENTLY GO TOWARD THEM. I THINK OUR- BUT THIS TO REALLY EXPAND IT YET YOU KNOW THAT THE APPRENTICESHIP INITIATIVE TO OTHER KEY OPEN TO NEW FIELDS TO. I'M BECAUSE WE THINK THAT THAT THE MODEL WORKS AND IS ABLE TO DEVELOP. A PROGRAM TO COMMUNITY COLLEGES I JUST HOPE YOU TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE STUDY THAT'S GOING TO BE RELEASED IN TIME AND I. WILL SEE AGAIN THAT I HAVE A HAND. FROM THE OHIO ANDI'S. YEAH THE STUDY IS GOING TO BE- VERY IMPORTANT BUDGET BUT ALSO- IF. YOU'RE GETTING YOUR QUESTION ABOUT THE EXISTING NEED. YOU KNOW WE LOOKED AT- TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE- HAD. ABOUT FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS HAD FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS TO AWARD. FOR FUTURE OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF GRANTS OF NEW INNOVATIVE GRANTS YOUR REFERENCING. AND DIDN'T GET ENOUGH ELIGIBLE APPLICANTS TO. ACTUALLY WORK TO FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS. AND SO THAT WAS EIGHTEEN NINETEEN THAT. THERE WAS NINETY TWENTY- GRASS ARE MONEY THAT THAT ACTUALLY NEVER WAS AWARDED AYE I DIDN'T I HAVEN'T CONFIRMED OF THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE ASSUME IT'S RELATED TO DISRUPTIONS CAUSED BY A PANDEMIC. BUT NEVERTHELESS NINETEEN TWENTY MONEY HAS NOT BEEN AWARDED THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE- SAYS THAT THEY'RE PLANNING TO PUT OUT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS THIS SPRING AND AWARD THE MONEY- IN FALL TWENTY TWENTY ONE AGAIN USING NINETEEN TWENTY MONEY FOR THAT SO. SO IF ANYTHING THERE'S THERE SEEMS TO BE SOME EXTRA MONEY OUT THERE RIGHT NOW SO SOMETHING LEGISLATURE YOU'LL ENCOURAGE JUST KEEP IN MIND ON WHETHER THAT. OF THAT MONEY CAN BE SCOOPED AND USED FOR YOU KNOW DIFFERENT PAY DOWNS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT BUT BUT CERTAINLY TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT WHAT THE NEED IS RIGHT NOW I'M ON- APPLICANTS AND WHETHER IT REALLY JUSTIFIES DOUBLING FUNDING. FOR THE PROGRAM GOING FORWARD THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS ON THIS ISSUE. SEVEN NINE ARMINA MOVED FIVE INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS IT'S THE SAME THREE PANELISTS FOR THE STARK WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THANK YOU DAN AND OUR DEPARTMENT FINANCE- TO BUDGET INCLUDES TWO PROPOSALS DESIGNED TO INCREASE THE AFFORDABILITY OF INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS THAT HELP REDUCE THE COST OF ATTENDANCE FOR STUDENTS. THE BUDGET INCLUDES FIFTEEN MILLION AND ONE TIME PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT FUNDING. WHAT DO YOU PROPOSE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF ZERO TEXTBOOK COST AGREES TIME WHICH WAS DOCUMENTED FUNDING IN THE TWENTY SIXTEEN BUT JACKS. IN TWO FIVE MILLION- IN ONE TIME PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT FUNDING. IS PROPOSED FOR INSTRUCTION MATERIALS FOR TWO ONE MOMENT STUDENTS AND WITH THAT I'M NOT ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE A CLIENT GOING TO THE GYM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR CALLING ON. THE FIRST ALL ALL ALL TALK ABOUT THE ZERO TEXTBOOK COST AGREE PROPOSAL THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE JUST INTRODUCED. IN THE GOVERNOR'S FOCUS ON TEXTBOOK AFFORDABILITY IS LAUDABLE. OPEN EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES THESE FREE RESOURCES CAN SAVE STUDENTS. IN A LOT OF MONEY. HAVING SAID THAT. THE LEGISLATURE FUNDED ZERO TEXTBOOK COST GRANTS IN TWENTY SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN. AND THE LEGISLATURE STILL. AWAITING STATUTORILY REQUIRED REPORT FROM THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. FINE HOW OLD THAT INITIATIVE WENT YOU KNOW HOW MANY DEGREES WERE CREATED HOW MANY STUDENTS ACTUALLY. EARNED A DEGREE IN THOSE OF THREE PATHWAYS THOSE FREE TEXTBOOK PATHWAYS. WHAT WERE THE BEST PRACTICES AND LESSONS LEARNED FROM THAT EXPERIENCE. SO THAT KIND OF INFORMATION IS REALLY IMPORTANT IF THE LEGISLATURE IS CONTEMPLATING IN A SECOND ROUND OF FUNDING SO WE READ. WE WERE- WITHHOLD RECOMMENDATION PENDING RECEIPT OF THIS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WE HAVE HEARD FROM WHICH OFFICE THAT. THAT THE REPORT IS CLOSE THE SENATE FINAL STAGES AND THAT INFORMATION- COULD YOU KNOW WOULD BE USEFUL SO SOME OF THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT TO GET THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE UNTIL. EARLY APRIL TO SUBMIT THE REQUIRED REPORT THE LEGISLATURE THAT COULD DECIDE WHETHER FUND ANOTHER ROUND. AND IF THE LEGISLATURE DECIDES TO FIND ANOTHER ROUND TO STRUCTURE THAT ROUND. IN A WAY THAT REFLECTS WHAT WERE THE LESSONS THAT WERE LEARNED FROM THE FIRST ROUND. NOW FOR REPORT IS NOT FORTHCOMING- SO HAVE A LOOK THE CHANCE OFFICE IT IS ENABLED IT TO FINISH IT BY. YOU KNOW WITHIN THE NEXT MONTH OR TWO LEGISLATURE COULD REQUEST THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE TO WORK WITH. ANOTHER KEY PARTNERS ACADEMIC SENATE. OUT OF THE CAR CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES. OVER TE COMING YEARS TO REFINE THE PROGRAM THE PROPOSAL HOME PROPOSAL AND HAVE IT READY FOR CONSIDERATION AS PART OF THE- TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE BUDGET PROCESS. ON THE- INSTRUCTION WITH. FOR DOING WOMAN'S THIS IS ACTUALLY A SUIT AGAINST WITH. OF CERTAIN TYPE OF TOOL STUDENT AND ACCESS PASS. OF STUDENTS UNLIKE REGULAR. STUDENTS SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES MUST PROVIDE INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS SUCH AS BOOKS FREE OF CHARGE TO HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS WHO ARE PARTICIPATING IN THE COLLEGE AND CAREER ACCESS PATHWAYS PROGRAM IS DUAL ENROLLMENT PROGRAM. THE LEGISLATURE CREATED BACK IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN. THE ADMINISTRATION CONTENDS THAT IN TERMS OF THE- THAT THAT THE REQUIREMENTS- THAT SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES HAVE TO COVER TEXTBOOK COSTS IS SERVING AS A BARRIER FOR THE SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES IN OFFERING VISA THESE TYPES OF DUAL ENROLLMENT PROGRAMS. AND THAT'S WHY THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES TWO POINT FIVE MILLION ONE TIME FOR THESE INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS. SO WE HAVE A COMMENTS ON THIS- YOU KNOW IF YOU LOOK AT HOW THE PROGRAM HAS GONE HAS GROWN SINCE. SINCE IT BEGAN IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN- OR SO IT'S GROWING VERY RAPIDLY IS STARTED WITH. ABOUT TWENTY EIGHT OF STUDENTS AT IN THE IN THE PROS IN THIS- DUAL ENROLLMENT PROGRAM IN TWENTY SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN THAT GREW BY A COUPLE THOUSAND IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN. DOUBLED THE NEXT YEAR AND NOW IT'S UP TO MORE THAN FOURTEEN THOUSAND FULL TIME EQUIVALENT STUDENTS. OR F. T. S. SO IT'S A IT'S A VERY POPULAR PROGRAM WITH STUDENTS AND WITH SCHOOLS AND WITH COLLEGES AND- SO THAT LOOKING AT THAT IT'S UNCLEAR TO US SAID CERTAIN CERTAINLY NOT ASSIGN IT. IS SERVING AS A AS A BARRIER- TO GROWTH ANOTHER POINT TO KEEP IN MIND IS RATHER THAN SERVING AS A FINANCIAL BARRIER. THE FUNDING POLICIES FOR THIS STORM RUNNER PROGRAM THAT COLLAGEN CORRECT ACCESS PATHWAYS PROGRAM CAN REALLY WORK TO THE BENEFIT OF COLLEGES. AND SCHOOLS. AT THE OLD. THESE THESE ARE COURSES ARE ARE MAINLY THESE ARE COLLEGE LEVEL COURSES THAT ARE OFFERED MAINLY. ON HIGH SCHOOL CAMPUS ON A CLOSED HIGH SCHOOL CAMPUS AND ALLOWS COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO CLAIM FULL APPORTIONMENT. FROM THE STATE WITHOUT INCURRING FACILITY COSTAS'S TYPICALLY AT THE HIGH SCHOOL LOCATION AND THE COLLEGES CAN SAVE MONEY IN OTHER WAYS AND OTHER OPERATING. COSTS- ANOTHER POINT IS IN MANY. FROM DINNER BUT IF YOU BE TO WRAP BECAUSE WE GOT TO GET TO PAY CON HERE. FOR SURE IN A OF THE- OTHER- THERE'S OTHER WAYS COLLEGE CAN REDUCE COSTS OF SUCH AS BY- USING OPEN EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES. SO FOR ALL THESE REASONS WE RECOMMEND OF THE LEGISLATURE REJECT THIS PROPOSAL YOU USING ONE TIME MONEY FOR PURCHASING INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS INSTEAD USE IT FOR OTHER PRIORITIES SUCH AS DEFERRED PAY DOWNS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. THE SENATE ALERTED MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ON MY COMMENTS WILL FOCUS ONLY ON OPEN EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES TEXTBOOK COSTS FOR MANY OF OUR STUDENTS ARE BECOMING AFFORDABILITY CHALLENGE ON AVERAGE OUR STUDENTS SPEND EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS ON BOOKS SO TRANSITIONING FROM OUR DEPENDENCY ON TEXTBOOKS TO MORE INNOVATIVE MODELS SUCH AS THE USE OF. OPEN EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES KNOWN AS A WE ARE CAN SUPPORT THE AFFORDABILITY AGENDA IN THIS BUDGET WITH THE LEADERSHIP OF THE ACADEMIC SENATE FOR CALIFORNIA'S COMMUNITY COLLEGES WE ARE WORKING TO ENSURE THAT CONTENT DEVELOPED UNDER PRIOR- WE ARE INVESTMENTS CAN BE SHARED ACROSS THE SYSTEM. MOVING FORWARD THE SUPPORT OF THE ACADEMIC SEGMENT SENATE AND OUR FACULTY WILL CONTINUE TO BE CRITICAL TO THE CRITICAL DRIVER TO MOVING THE ZERO TEXTBOOK COST AGENDA FORWARD WE LOOK AT WE WILL STAND READY TO IMPLEMENT THIS AS NEEDED. ANSWER QUESTIONS. LET ME JUST ONE OF FINANCE BY TO OHIO. THAT WE- THE- PIECES OF THE- FOR THE REASONS THAT THEY- TO HAVE ANY. TO THAT. I THINK I'D- DURING OUR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I WOULD JUST GO BACK TO WHAT I- WE'VE SAID PREVIOUSLY THAT THIS COUNTRY REALLY IS THE STUDENT FOCUS BUDGET- INTO ONE OF THE ONE OF THE GOALS PUT INTO THIS BUDGET ESPECIALLY WITH RESPECT TO THE YOUR TAX ACCOUNT AGREED TO- TRYING TO PROVIDE. CONTINUING IN ASKING A COLLEGES. THANK YOU IT WILL BE SOMETHING WE WILL HAVE TO CONSIDER FOR THE QUESTIONS- CENTER MINT. I JUST AFFECTED BY MR HANNAH OUR DEPARTMENT FINANCE- GOING BACK I MEAN THE BOTH WITH RESPECT TO THE DUAL ENROLLMENT INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS- AND OR THE ZERO TEXTBOOK COST AGREES- IT MAY BE GOOD JUST LIKE BRIEFLY WALK US THROUGH THE EVIDENCE YOU USE IN FORMULATING ITS BUDGET. BECAUSE LA- IS TELLING US THESE THESE ARE- IS THAT. THESE WOULD NOT HAVE THE DESIRED EFFECT SO FOLLOWING UP ON CARE LARGE QUESTION AT YOU REALLY WHAT WAS THE BASIS FOR YOUR DECISION TO MAKE THE SIGN I ASIDE FROM BEING STUDENT CENTERED. WELL YOU HAVE BEEN IS USED TO DETERMINE THE STUDENTS THAT THESE WOULD ACTUALLY BE EFFECTIVE IN HELPING STUDENTS- EITHER WITH THE- THE EXPANSION OF THE ZERO TEXT BOOK- BASED APPROACH OR WITH GOLDEN GIRL FINALEMENT. I THINK AT THE MOMENT I DON'T HAVE A SPECIFIC SPECIFIC SURVEYED OR OR ANY SORT OF STUDIED CUT TO POINT TO I THINK BASED ON WHAT WE'VE SEEN BOTH OF THESE PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN. SUCCESSFUL IN HELPING TO CREATE SAVINGS FOR STUDENTS AND OPEN A GREAT YOU- TRANSITIONS FOR STUDENTS TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND WHATEVER THEIR GOALS MIGHT BE. WHETHER THAT BE THE- GTA P. PROGRAM- BY THAT THAT THAT CALL IT A CALIFORNIA COLLEGE AND CAREER ACCESS PATHWAYS PROGRAMS THAT- MY COLLEAGUE NEARLY A TALK ABOUT. OR DID YOUR TAX BECAUSE DEGREES- AND SO AS AS PART OF TRYING TO HELP STUDENTS WITH THEIR- COVER THEIRNEEDS AND THEIR THEIR CONCERT IN WITH COMMUNITY COLLEGE. ON THE BUDGET DECIDED TO MAKE ADDITIONAL. INVESTMENTS- THANK YOU. AND I WOULD JUST MY THE STATE THAT IF YOU HAD TO THE MIRROR MAY. AND YOU FIND THINGS THAT ARE RESPONSIVE. TO SENATOR MEN'S QUESTION ABOUT EVIDENCE BASED PLEASE BRING IT FORWARD SO THAT. WE HAVE ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS ON THE SIDE OF. AND- WE WILL MOVE TO THE LAST ITEM OF THE SIX ISSUES PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT SAME THREE PANELISTS BEGIN WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. IN OVER TO PERMANENT FINANCE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES TWENTY MILLION ONE TIME FOR CULTURALLY COMPETENT PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOR FACULTY THAT LEVERAGES MODERN TECHNOLOGY- THE INTENT OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO PROVIDE FACULTY WITH PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT DESIGNED TO PRIMARILY SUPPORT THEIR CONTINUED. ADAPTATION TO THE ONLINE AND TECHNOLOGICALLY AT THE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT SUCH AS PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AN ONLINE INSTRUCTIONAL DESIGN ONLINE COURSE DELIVERY AND THE UTILIZATION OF TECHNOLOGY IN TEACHING COURSES. IT MEASURES MINISTRATION EXPECT THAT THIS PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT. INTEGRATE EQUITY AND CULTURAL CONFIDENCE INTO THE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AT THE KEY DESIGN PRINCIPLE- I DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE L. L. BAKALY HAVE ACCESS TO MULTIPLE FORMS OF PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT INCLUDING PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOCUS SPECIFICALLY ON USING DIGITAL TOOLS AND TEACHING ONLINE COLLAGENS OF AS COLLEGES AND DEPARTMENTS COMMONLY PROVIDE TRAINING USING THEIR PORTION OF MONEY OR OTHER FUNDS TO FACULTY. THE STATE FUNDS INSTITUTIONAL EFFECTIVENESS PARTNERSHIP INITIATIVE INCLUDING TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS ALREADY AND BASS FUNDING FOR TRAININGS FOR FACULTY AND STAFF IN VARIOUS TOPICS OF THIS PAST FALL THE ACADEMIC SENATE REPORTS THAT HOLDING FORTY ONE- WEBINARS ON TEACHING ONLINE- THE STATE ALSO FUNDS A PROGRAM THROUGH THE ONLINE EDUCATION INITIATIVE. FOCUSED ON. HELPING FACULTY TEACH ONLINE DEVELOP COURSES ONLINE. AND THERE'S EVEN COURSES- OR OR MODULES THAT FACULTY CAN TAKE ON CULTURALLY COMPETENT- TEACHING METHODOLOGIES- WE WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT THE THAT THE US COMMITTEE COLLEGES HAVE RECEIVED SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY BEFORE CONVERTING TO ONLINE AND THAT'S FROM THE STATE AS AS WELL AS THE FEDERAL. RELIEF MONEY SO GIVEN ALL OF THESE ARE STATE FUNDED- PROGRAMS GIVEN THE FEDERAL RELIEF MONEY THAT COLLEGES. HAVE USED FOR. ONLINE- TEACHING AND- THE CONVERSION- THAT THEY CAN CONTINUE TO USE THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDS- AS PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IS UNCLEAR- SO WE RECOMMEND REJECTING THE PROPOSAL AND RE PURPOSING THE FUNDS FOR HIGHER PRIORITY ONE TIME FOR. A PRIORITY SUCH AS DEFERRAL PAYDOWNS OR HELPING WITH PENSIONS OTHER OTHER TYPES OF ACTIVITIES SUCH AS THAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THE COMPANY CAN COLLEGES OUR STUDENTS A TEN CAMPUSES ACROSS DIVERSE SYSTEM OF WHICH 72% OF OUR STUDENTS OUR STUDENTS OF COLOR IMMIGRANTS ARE BOTH SUPPORTING EFFORTS TO INCREASE DIVERSITY AND CULTURAL COMPETENCY ARE VITAL TO ENSURING THAT STUDENTS.
