CLEARLY WELCOME BACK AUGUST TWELFTH HEARING THIS IS NOT JANUARY. AND WE DO HAVE ONE ACR IN THEM. WE WILL BEGIN FIRST DO WE HAVE YES WE DO WE HAVE CORMS WE WILL BEGIN WITH. ROLL CALL PLEASE. LIVE ON. CAN OKAY HAN. BURKE CERVANTES CHOI. CHOI YEAH. GABRIEL GRAYSON MELENDEZ. MARK STONE. WEBER WICKS. MEDICAL CREATE WE HAVE QUORUM THANK YOU I'D LIKE TO INVITE US ON A NUMBER OF KAMLAGER-DOVE WHO HAS ACR ONE FIFTEEN AND THAT SHE WILL BE PRESENTING TODAY. A GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS. I HOPE EVERYONE HAD A RESTFUL. RECESS. I AM HERE PRESENTING AC ARE ONE ONE FIVE WHICH URGES BANKS THAT HAVE OPENED DEMAND ACCOUNTS WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO STOP LENDING TO GUN MANUFACTURERS. I THINK AND HOPE THAT WE ARE ALL COMMITTED TO ENDING GUN VIOLENCE. THERE ARE WAY TOO MANY GUN RELATED INCIDENTS THAT ARE HAPPENING IN OUR COMMUNITIES THAT WE SEE AND READ ABOUT IN THE NEWS. AND AFTER EACH SUCH INCIDENT WE MOURN THE DEATHS AND SYMPATHIZE WITH THE VICTIMS BUT DO LITTLE TO REDUCE OUR OWN VULNERABILITY. TO TRY AND PREVENT MASS SHOOTINGS AND TO PREVENT OTHER FIREARM RELATED PROBLEMS SUCH AS HOMICIDES SUICIDES GUN ROBBERY GUN INTIMIDATIONS AND GUN ACCIDENTS. I BELIEVE WE MUST ACT ON ALL FRONTS TO ADDRESS GUN CONTROL. THIS INCLUDES INVESTIGATING THE FINANCIAL QUESTION OF GUN MANUFACTURING. AS IT STANDS CALIFORNIA HAS ESTABLISHED A HUNDRED AND NINE GUN CONTROL LAWS AND HAS BEEN A BREEDING GROUND FOR ANTI GUN VIOLENCE ACTIVISM. AND YET SIX OF THE BANKS CALIFORNIA HAS ACCOUNTS WITH HAVE PRIORITIZE PROFIT OVER CALIFORNIAN VALUES. WHY DO BANKS REMAIN RELATIVELY QUIET WHILE CALIFORNIANS HAVE BEEN SO VOCAL ABOUT GUN VIOLENCE AND GUN VIOLENCE PREVENTION. THE PUBLIC POLICY INSTITUTE OF CALIFORNIA HAS SHOWN THAT SINCE TWENTY FIFTEEN SIX IN TEN CALIFORNIANS WANT STRICTER GUN LAWS. BANK OF AMERICA CITY BANK JPMORGAN CHASE BANK U. S. BANK UNION BANK AND WELLS FARGO BANK ARE PROVIDING LOANS OR LINE OF CREDIT TO GUN MANUFACTURERS WHICH A MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIANS HAVE DEEMED A SOCIAL HAZARD. CITY BANK IS A POSITIVE EXAMPLE OF A CALIFORNIA BANKING INSTITUTION THAT HAS TAKEN THE LEAD AND IS SLOWLY DIVESTING FROM GUN MANUFACTURERS. AND YET THERE ARE OTHERS WHO SPEAK OF CODE OF ETHICS. PROMISING TO SPEAK UP WHEN THEY SEE SOMETHING. AND TALKING ABOUT THE ABILITY TO DO THE RIGHT THING IN MAKING SURE THAT THEY ARE DOING THE RIGHT THING AS FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WHEN IT IS NOT THE EASY THING TO DO AND YET THEY MAKE NO PUBLIC STANCE ON DOING BUSINESS WITH THE GUN INDUSTRY AND HAVE CONTINUED TO FINANCE MILLIONS. WITH THE GUN INDUSTRY. NOW THESE BANKS ARE NOT BREAKING ANY LAWS AND THIS IS A RESOLUTION IT IS NOT A RESOLUTION ABOUT BREAKING LAWS IT IS A RESOLUTION TALKING ABOUT. CHANGING BEHAVIOR. IT'S A RESOLUTION ABOUT VALUES. WHY IS IT OKAY THAT WE ASK OUR PARENTS TO BUY BULLET PROOF BACKPACKS. BUT WE'RE NOT WILLING TO ASK BANKS TO RECONSIDER LENDING TO MANUFACTURERS RESPONSIBLE FOR MAKING GUNS. I URGE THE LEGISLATURE TO ENCOURAGE INVESTING WITH INSTITUTIONS THAT PROTECT CALIFORNIA'S VALUES. WITH ME IN SUPPORT TODAY IS AMANDA WILCOX FROM THE CALIFORNIA CHAPTER OF THE BRADY UNITED AGAINST GUN VIOLENCE. GOOD AFTERNOON AGAIN I'M AMANDA WILCOX WITH BRADY CALIFORNIA UNITED AGAINST GUN VIOLENCE WE HAVE CHAPTERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE MANY OF OUR MEMBERS INCLUDING MYSELF HAVE LOST A LOVED ONE CAN TO GUNFIRE. NORMAN BEFORE HE WON THE PUBLIC MANY OF YOU IN THE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE AND I'LL BE FOURTH RIGHT FROM THE GET GO TO MET THAT I DO NOT HAVE MUCH BACKGROUND EXPERIENCE IN FINANCIAL OR BANKING MATTERS I'VE BEEN A LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE AS A VOLUNTEER FOR FIFTEEN YEARS IN OUR STATE. CALIFORNIA'S YOU PROBABLY KNOW CALIFORNIA HAS A STRONG THIS GUN LAWS IN THE NATION. AND SINCE NINETEEN NINETY THREE WE HAVE DROPPED HER GUN DEATH RATE BY 55% ALMOST FOUR TIMES THE DECREASE IN THE REST OF THE NATION. OUR GUN LAWS ARE MAKING A DIFFERENCE. BUT NONE THE LESS WITH OVER THREE THOUSAND FIREARM DEATHS IN CALIFORNIA IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THAT'S THE LAST YEAR FOR WHICH WE HAVE DATA. CLEARLY MORE MUST BE DONE. NOT AND ONE OF THE PROTESTERS TO ADDRESS THE PROLIFERATION OF GUNS. THE RESEARCH IS VERY CLEAR THAT WHERE THERE ARE MORE GUNS THERE ARE MORE FIREARM DEATH WE HAVE THE INDUSTRY AND OUR NATION WHOSE PURPOSE IS TO SELL MORE GUNS AND MAKE MONEY. ARE THE NRA I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY REPRESENTS THE GUN INDUSTRY GUN MANUFACTURERS NOT THE PUBLIC AS THE PUBLIC ARE. THE LARGE MAJORITY OF THE PUBLIC OVER 90% SUPPORT BACKGROUND CHECKS FOR ALL GUN SALES. 87% ARE SUPPORT RED FLAG WORD COMBINES RESTRAINING ORDER TYPE LAWS I THINK IT'S IN THE LATE HI SIXTIES PERCENT SUPPORT ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN. THE MISMATCH BETWEEN WHAT WASHINGTON. DOES NOT TO IN TERMS OF GUN VIOLENCE PREVENTION. AND WHERE THE PUBLIC OPINION IS ON THIS ISSUE IS BECAUSE OF THE POWER INFLUENCE OF THE GUN INDUSTRY WE NEED TO PUSH BACK AGAINST GUN INDUSTRY AND ONE WAY TO DO THAT. AS I SUGGESTED BY THIS RESOLUTION IS TO STOP THE LENDING TO GUN MANUFACTURERS WORE OUT SO THAT THEY CAN'T BE IN A BAY HAVE TO GO ELSEWHERE AND MAY BE PAUSE IF THEY'RE LOSING THAT KIND OF THING FINANCING FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BANKS THAT WORK WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THERE'S BEEN OTHER EFFORTS SUCCESSFUL EFFORTS TO GET THE GUN INDUSTRY TO CHANGE BEHAVIOR BOB FROM FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS PUTTING PRESSURE ON. FOR EXAMPLE NOT SELLING GUNS TO UNDER TWO PEOPLE AGE TWENTY ONE OR NOT TELLING ASSAULT WEAPONS THERE HAVE BEEN EFFORTS TO CHANGE BEHAVIOR SO THAT FEWER INAPPROPRIATE PEOPLE ARE POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS TO FIREARMS. AND I THINK THIS EFFORT TO. A RESOLUTION AND THE LANDING TO GUN MANUFACTURERS AND THAT'S THAT SOME REMEMBER SAID THIS IS A NEW LAW IT'S A RESOLUTION. BUT I THINK IT'S A STATEMENT OF NOT ONLY WERE CALIFORNIA IS BUT WORK WHERE OUR NATION IS. ON THIS MATTER THAT WE ARE IN A CRISIS IN OUR COUNTRY RIGHT NOW WITH GUN VIOLENCE WE NEED ALL APPROACHES. TO DEAL WITH THIS CRISIS AND THIS IS ONE WAY IS SIGNIFICANT WAY I THINK THAT WE CAN PUSH BACK ON GUN MANUFACTURERS IN THE GUN INDUSTRY. TIRED YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND. ANY ARE OF. ANY THE SORRY WELCOME BACK TO PER SE SO ANY OTHER AT WITNESSES IN SUPPORT PLEASE COME TO THE MICROPHONE JUST STATE YOUR NAME AND YOUR AFFILIATION PLEASE. COMING QUICK BAY AREA STUDENT ACTIVISTS IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. SEEN NO OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT I'D LIKE TO INVITE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION TO COME TO THE TABLE. SCENE. NO WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION WILL TAKE MEMBER COMMENTS WE HAVE ASSEMBLY MEMBER WICKS THANK YOU ONE I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHORS FOR BRINGING THIS RESOLUTION FORWARD AND WE SAID ON PUBLIC SAFETY TOGETHER WE SEE ALL THE TIME A PUBLIC SAFETY AS WELL YOU KNOW I THINK WITH THIS RESOLUTION DOES THAT AIMS TO GET REALLY IT TO THE SUPPLY CHAIN QUESTION AND THE UPSTREAM PART OF THE TRAGEDIES THAT WE SEE AND FEEL AND EXPERIENCE IN OUR COMMUNITIES WHICH WE'VE OBVIOUSLY HAD MORE RECENT. TRAGEDIES AS OF LATE WHICH IS DEEPLY SADDENING UNFORTUNATE AND I THINK WHAT THE BILL OR WHAT SORRY WHAT THE RESOLUTION IS TRYING TO DO IS TO SAY OKAY THROUGH THE SUPPLY CHAIN AT EVERY LEVEL HOW ARE WE ALL TAKING A DEEP LOOK AT WHAT OUR COLLECTIVE RESPONSIBILITY AS INCLUDING OUR BANKS SO I THINK IT'S A CRITICAL RESOLUTION AND I THINK WE ALL HAVE TO LOOK AT WHEN WE HAVE THIRTY THREE THOUSAND DEATHS A YEAR WHO'S CONTRIBUTING TO THAT RIGHT AND HOW WE'RE ALL TAKING PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR SOLVING THIS PROBLEM SO I JUST WANTED TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. WOULD LOVE TO BE A CO AUTHOR AND DO ANYTHING I CAN TO SUPPORT IT. ASSEMBLYMEMBER MELINDA'S THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR ASSEMBLY WOMAN I JUST I NEED TO KNOW WHAT IS THE GOAL. BEHIND THIS RESOLUTION YOU WANT. GUN MANUFACTURERS AND RETAILERS TO NOT HAVE A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION WITH WHICH TO BANK IS THAT THE GOAL THE GOAL IS TO EXPAND THE CONVERSATION THAT WE'VE BEEN HAVING AROUND GUN VIOLENCE AND GUN VIOLENCE PREVENTION OKAY BUT YOUR ISOLATION DOESN'T ASK FOR CONVERSATION IT ENCOURAGES BANKS TO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH GUN MANUFACTURERS AND GUN RETAILERS SO THAT'S WHY I'M SAYING IT'S LEADING ME TO BELIEVE THAT YOUR GOAL IS TO BE IS TO PUT GUN MANUFACTURERS AND RETAILERS IN A POSITION WHERE THEY DON'T HAVE A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION. WITH WHICH TO DO BUSINESS IS THAT YOUR GOAL THAT IS ONE OF THE GOALS BUT THIS RIGHT HERE IS THE CONVERSATION THAT WE'RE HAVING JUST BECAUSE WE BROUGHT THE RESOLUTION FORWARD WE TEND TO HAVE A NUMBER OF CONVERSATIONS AS IT RELATES TO GUN VIOLENCE SPEAKING SPECIFICALLY ON THE DEMAND SIDE THE FOLKS WHO WANT TO PURCHASE A GUN THE FOLKS WHO HAVE A GUN IF THEY HAVE A GUN THAT'S- BEEN LEGALLY PURCHASED OR NOT. WHERE THEY'RE BUYING THE GUN FROM WHO THE DEALER IS HOW MUCH AMMUNITION THEY'RE ALLOWED TO PER WHAT'S BILLION A DAY IS THAT OF ANY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS SO THAT HAS BEEN THE KINDS OF CONVERSATIONS THAT WE'VE BEEN HAVING THIS IS SAYING LET'S HAVE A DIFFERENT CONVERSATION ALSO AS IT RELATES TO GUN VIOLENCE AND GUN VIOLENCE PREVENTION AND TALK ABOUT THE SUPPLY SIDE YOU CANNOT HAVE A GUN IF THE GUN IS NOT BEEN MADE. YOU CANNOT SELL A GUN THAT HAS NOT BEEN MADE THE REALITY IS THERE FOUR HUNDRED MILLION GUNS IN THIS COUNTRY SO EVERYONE STILL HAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO AT LEAST HAVE ONE. BUT I AM CERTAINLY NOT INTERESTED IN JUST TALKING ABOUT THE DEMAND SIDE THE OTHER REALITY IS WE LIVE. IN A FREE MARKET SOCIETY SO I THINK IT'S PRESUMPTUOUS TO SAY IF YOU CANNOT GO TO ONE LENDING INSTITUTION THEN YOUR OPPORTUNITY TO MANUFACTURE A GUN IS SHOT. THAT'S KIND OF THE INCENTIVE TO LIVING IN A FREE MARKET CAPITALISTIC SOCIETY IT'S ALSO I THINK UNFAIR TO SUGGEST. THAT THIS IS THE YOU KNOW THE ONLY PRODUCT THAT'S AVAILABLE FOR LENDING INSTITUTIONS TO INVESTING IN ORDER TO MAKE MONEY WE HAVE SEEN THAT PROVE ITSELF NOT TO BE TRUE IN HISTORY AS IT RELATES TO YOU KNOW. INSTANCES LIKE DIVESTING IN SOUTH AFRICA. COMPANIES STILL FOUND WAYS TO EARN MONEY AND TO BE SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE. OKAY I AM EVEN MORE CONFUSING I'M YOU. YOU STATED THAT YOUR GOAL IS TO GET TO THE POINT WHERE THESE MANUFACTURERS AND RETAILERS HAVE NO FINANCIAL INSTITUTION TO DO BUSINESS WITH YOU ALSO MADE A COMMENT ABOUT. IF THE GUN DOESN'T EXIST THING YOU CAN'T BUY IT SO I GUESS THE OTHER PART OF THE GOAL IS TO. JUST GET TO A POINT WHERE. THESE WEAPONS AREN'T BEING MANUFACTURED IS THAT PART OF THE GOAL THAT LESS GUNS OUR MAIN GOAL IS TO ENCOURAGE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO RECONSIDER. THOSE WITH HOME THEY LAND DEBT TO SPECIFICALLY TARGETING GUN MANUFACTURERS OKAY SO THEN. MEAN IDEOLOGICALLY WE'RE COMPLETE OPPOSITES ON THIS ISSUE WHICH IS WHICH IS FINE I'M JUST. I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND IF. THERE HAS BEEN FOLLOW THROUGH IN THINKING ABOUT THE RAMIFICATIONS OF SOMETHING LIKE THIS FOR INSTANCE EVERY LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. NEEDS FIREARMS. SO IF YOU ENCOURAGE. LENDING INSTITUTIONS TO NOT. DO BUSINESS WITH THE GUN MANUFACTURERS AND RETAILERS WHERE THEN WELL OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES JUST AS ONE EXAMPLE GET THEIR FULL GET THEIR FIREARMS FOR THEIR OFFICERS TO DO THEIR JOB WELL THIS IS SPECIFICALLY TARGETING THOSE BANKS THAT HAVE OPEN ACCOUNTS WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIANS CHIANG MAI QUESTIONS SO THE OTHER THING IS BANK OF AMERICA. AND CITI GROUP. HAVE TAKEN MEASURES. IN THIS ARENA AT BANK OF AMERICA FOR EXAMPLE HAS STOP LENDING TO COMPANIES THAT MAKE MILITARY INSPIRED FIREARMS FOR CIVILIAN USE AND CITY GROUP ONLY WORKS WITH CLIENTS THAT HAVE AGREED TO CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS ON FIREARMS SALES. SO THAT AND ONE OF THOSE BANKS REFINANCED REMINGTON OUTDOOR WHICH MANUFACTURES ASSAULT WEAPONS. YOU CAN'T HAVE IT BOTH WAYS. WELL UNFORTUNATELY I THINK WE CAN HAVE IT BOTH WAYS ALL THE TIME. SO OKAY. I JUST I JUST WANT TO HEAR THE ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION OR TO MY QUESTION WHICH IS. IF ALL OF OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES MUST PURCHASE THEIR FIREARMS FROM SOMEONE. WHERE WILL THEY- SO I'M WHERE WILL THEY GO THERE ARE WITH A PAYING CASH. THERE ARE OVER A DOZEN. FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. THAT LAND DEBT TO GUN MANUFACTURERS. I DON'T HAVE INFORMATION WITH ME CURRENTLY THAT WILL TELL ME. WHERE ALL OF THE LAW ENFORCEMENT ENTITIES ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ARE PURCHASING THEIR GUNS. IN ORDER FOR ME TO SPECIFICALLY ANSWER THE QUESTION THAT YOU'RE ASKING I DON'T BELIEVE THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT AS PAYING CASH THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS RESOLUTION IS SAYING THIS RESOLUTION IS ENCOURAGING FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT LAND THAT HAVE OPEN ACCOUNTS WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO REEVALUATE. THEIR LENDING PRACTICES TO THOSE THAT MANUFACTURE GUNS. OKAY WELL THANK YOU AND I DON'T HAVE ANY MORE QUESTIONS AND I KNOW IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE A SHORT HEARING I WILL JUST SAY THAT I THINK THE THIRD OFF A LOT OF THINGS WRONG WITH THIS RESOLUTION EVEN THIS IS THIS ISN'T LEGALLY BINDING IT DOESN'T CHANGE THE LAW. BUT IT CERTAINLY IF I WERE A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION I WOULD TAKE IT AS A THREAT. I WOULD TAKE IT AS A THREAT COMING FROM. THE LEGISLATURE SAYING IF YOU DON'T IMPOSE OUR WILL ON YOUR CLIENTS. THERE WILL BE CONSEQUENCES AND I DON'T THINK THAT THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD BE. PART PARTICIPATING IN THAT SORT OF BEHAVIOR BECAUSE YOU HAVE A PARTICULAR VALUE OR IDEOLOGICAL VIEW POINT THAT YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE ELSE IN THE STATE MUST SHARE. STARTING WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTION I THINK THAT'S A DANGEROUS PRECEDENT TO SET. AND I THINK LOOK TO THE FUTURE. WHERE THE TABLES MIGHT BE TURNED IN YOU MIGHT NOT LIKE THE WAY SOMEONE ELSE IMPOSES THIS THIS TYPE OF LEGISLATION ON OTHER INDUSTRY SO THAT'S ALL I HAVE THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER MEMBERS. ASSEMBLYMEMBER CHOI. THANK YOU CHAIR. ASSEMBLYMAN KNOCKED ON LIKE A DAHLE VIA I OR SO WOULD LIKE TO ADD US SOME OF MY FEELINGS AND THE QUESTIONS SO I THINK I UNDERSTAND YOUR. INTENT THAT IS ONE WAY THE OF HELPING. REDUCING GUN VIOLENCE. IN THE WAKE OF US SO MANY. MASS SHOOTING SAID THAT THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE AND THAT GOING ON IN THE WILL CALL ON IN OBVIOUSLY. I COME FROM. A COUNTRY. WHERE PROFIT THE OWNERSHIP IS A TOTALLY BANNED FROM SOUTH KOREA AND OTHER THAN OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THE MILITARY. AND BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THAT THERE MAY BE SOME ILLEGAL PRIVATE DONORS IT MAY BE BUT IT IS TOTALLY BAD SO. I UNDERSTOOD THAT CONCEPT THE BUT THE WHEN I ARRIVED HERE. OUR I MEAN THIS IS SO OUT IN THE CONSTITUTION. YEAH IS THAT THE PROHIBITING GUN OWNERSHIP QUARTERLY I MEAN NOTE THAT NOT ALL OF. PROHIBITING. IN THE WEST A PROTECTING GUARD OWNERSHIP BY INDIVIDUAL. AND A NOW I UNDERSTOOD THAT THE WHY THAT WAS SO IMPORTANT TO IN THIS COUNTRY THAT THAT HAS TO BE. INSCRIBED IN THE EVEN IN OUR CONSTITUTION. IN THIS COUNTRY OF A VAST LAND AND A PIONEER. A FROM THE EAST TO THE WEST. NO LAW. YEAH FIGHTING AGAINST ALL KINDS OF ELEMENTS. EXPORTS TO SOAR YOU ARE THE ALL IN ALL A SO I MEAN GUN OWNERSHIP I THINK THAT THAT IS A DEEPLY ROOTED HOW IMPORTANT THE PROTECTING INDIVIDUAL AW YEAH LIFE AND PROPERTY AND ALSO IN THIS COUNTRY WE- ARE THE COUNTRY OP ARE MADE UP OF A IMMIGRANTS. AND IT IS SON NOT JUST A HOME WITH GENIUS SO WE VERY MULTI. RACIAL OR ETHNIC THE. ULTRA OUR DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS THAT DOES NOT HELP TO UNDERSTAND. NOT TOTALLY HOMOGENEOUS A CULTURAL UNDERSTANDING WHAT THINKING IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT IN ALSO. AT THAT THE ONLY THE AYE AYE. STUDY AND THE THOUGHT ABOUT WHY CAN OWNERSHIP BUT IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT ISSUE BUT NOW WE ARE FACING A LOT OF A DEBATE BECAUSE OF A GUN RELATED VIOLENCE IS. I MEAN NOT THAT WOULD BE NO ONE. ARE ANYWHERE. COOL ORDER CONDONE AND ENCOURAGE OR LACK THAT THAT KIND OF A YOU CAN RELATE TO. VIOLENCE AND THE MASS KILLING WITH THE WEAPONS. A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS THAT WE CAN RAISE. AT THAT BUT THE WHEN WE PROHIBITS POORLY CAN OWNERSHIP IN THIS COUNTRY. I DON'T KNOW WHERE THIS COUNTRY WOULD GO IN THAT THE ORIGIN ARE BASIC BUT INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY AND FREEDOM TO PROTECT MY LIFE IN THE MY PROPERTY GET IN WITH THE DISCOUNT ABOUT CULTURE AND THE BACKGROUND ON. WHY THE GUN OWNERSHIP BUT BECAME SO IMPORTANT. SO IT WILL BE AT A TO ME ON CONCEIVABLE. THE UNITED STATES SO. OF AMERICA ONE DAY. OUT WILL BE BEN INDIVIDUAL A GUN OWNERSHIP. WE HAVE INSTITUTED A DID YOU SAY ONE OH NINE DIFFERENT KINDS OF APPEARANCE THAT THE TRYING TO SCREEN AND INVESTIGATE THE BACKGROUND OF UP ARE INTENDED GUN NOT PURCHASES SO AS TO STUDY WHAT KIND OF CRAZY GUYS ARE TRYING TO BUY A GUN Là MENTALLY UNSTABLE GUY SICK GUY IS. DRUNK BY SO WE'RE TRYING TO PULL OFF. THE PERIOD THE ANGRY PEORIA AT THE BY CERTAIN THEN I ALL UNDERSTAND THAT THE- BUT THE WHEN YOU TRY TO. INTRODUCED AS SUCH RESOLUTION EVEN THOUGHT THAT IS ON NOT ENFORCEABLE IT'S A SORT ABA ENCOURAGEMENT. BUT THE NOW YOU MENTIONED ON SEVERAL TIME COUPLE TIMES THAT THAT THE FREE MARKET THE CONCEPT. WHEN IF YOU TO INTRODUCE AT THIS KIND OF A- RESOLUTION. AND THEN A HOLLOW WITH THIS WOULD BE PERCEIVED. BY THOSE INDUSTRY AND THE BANKS. WHAT YOU ARE TRYING TO DO WHAT WOULD BE I MEAN TO ME IT'S ALMOST A LACK OF WRITING ON THE WALL WHAT IS COMING. THAT THE ORDER VIA TOTALLY IF STEP AND COREY RESOLUTION DOESN'T WORK. IT CAN BE SOON INTRODUCED A HEY YOU DIDN'T LISTEN. IN A WITH YET GENTLE ENCOURAGEMENT. BY A AT THIS RESOLUTION THEN WE CAN I INTRODUCED A BILL. NOW THAT THAT THAT IS ALL OR MOST ALL IN ALL. T. MOBILE NEXT STEP. AND A WHAT WOULD BE THE NEXT TO KIND OF INDUSTRY THAT WE LEGISLATORS SO WE TRY TO A BAND BANGSA NOT TO DO ANY BUSINESS ANY ANY INDUSTRY ABOUT BUSINESS SO ODD THAT THAT WE DON'T NOT LACK HILL SO THIS IS OUR QUARTERLY. THE ARE INCOMPATIBLE WERE CONCEPT OF AMERICAN CAPITALISM AND FREE MARKET GAME AND THAT'S A SHOULD BE A NOT BANKS WON'T PRINCIPLE. WHOM YOU WILL NOT DO BUSINESS WITH. OKAY THE OTHER QUESTION IS THAT IF YOU DO BàN OR PROHIBIT TO ENCOURAGE THE RULE OF OUR SOLUTION ON ALL OF. AS A ASSEMBLY MEMBER LISA MELENDEZ INDICATED THAT THERE ARE TWO SIDES OF MONEY IS A CONSUMER USE AT THE OTHER ONE IS OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT MILITARY AWHILE PLEASE AWARE NEVER. SO WHAT WOULD BE THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE WARSAW SO I YOU WANNA. AMERICAN EXCEPTION IF YOU NEED THE MILLION DOLLAR LOAN TO A MANUFACTURER ARE ASSAULT WEAPONS SO THAT WILL BE SOLD THE TO MILITARY ALONE THEN. YOU CAN DO LOAN BANKING. AND THEY GIVE THE LOW. IT SOUNDS LIKE THEY'RE SUCH YOU QUESTIONS NESN DOT I MEAN RAISING NUMBER OF WITH THINGS SUCH AS I SPEAK SO I AM BASICALLY SAYING THAT THAT THIS APPROACH EVEN THOUGHT I UNDERSTAND YOU OR WRITTEN INTENT. BUT THE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THIS KIND OF PRINCE SPORTS SO AND THEN ALSO NEXT THAT IMPLEMENTATION IN ALL OF THIS IS SAID TO ME A VIOLATION OF A FREE KIND OF PRETTY MARKET CONCEPT THE AND INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS. AND THE FREEDOM ARE FULL. IF THE INDUSTRIAL INDIVIDUALS OF DOING BUSINESS. AND THE IMPLEMENTATION STAGE IS GOING TO BE VERY VERY DIFFICULT HOW WE CANNOT DISTINGUISH A WE WILL NEED THE PRODUCTION OF WEAPONS SELF FOR NATIONAL DEFENSE SO OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT WHATEVER. MIGHT SOLA CERTAIN COMPANIES WILL BE DEDICATED TO ON THE MANUFACTURING THOSE KIND OF WEAPONS BUT THE OTHER COMPANY WILL BE ONLY SELLING TO INDIVIDUALS. SO IT IN THAT CORDOBA. LEVEL IT WILL BE. CONFUSING ALL CONCEPT AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PARTY HASTA SO IF YOU HAVE A THOUGHT ABOUT THE OR THIS ASPECTS OF MAYBE YOU CAN. IN A COMMENT THAT FEW OF MY THOUGHTS AND PRIOR TO THE MEMBER. COMMENTING I DO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. WE ARE ALL TALKING ABOUT THE SAME RESOLUTION AS YOU WILL NOTE THIS ONLY APPLIES TO SIX OPEN DEMAND ACCOUNTS I AND PAGE TWO OF THE RESOLUTION IF YOU LOOK UNDER SECTION TWO DISCUSSION ALSO CLARIFIES THAT OTHER BANKS NONBANK LENDERS PRIVATE EQUITY AND BOND MARKETS WOULD. LIKELY EQUALLY SUPPLY CREDIT TO GUN MANUFACTURERS TO FILL THE GAPS THAT WOULD BE IMPACTED THAT COULD. BE IMPACTED THIS IS NOT A BILL THIS IS A RESOLUTION SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE ALL. THAT WILL HAVE THE ANALYSIS IN FRONT OF US AND CAN LEAD TO THAT SO WITH THAT IF YOU'D LIKE TO. COMMENT YOU'RE WELCOME TO. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR FOR THAT CLARIFICATION AND THANK YOU MISTER CHOI FOR ALL OF YOUR THOUGHTS AND YOUR COMMENTS. I DO WANNA JUST SORT OF RESPOND TO A FEW THINGS THIS IS NOT A SECOND AMENDMENT BAIL AS THE MADAM CHAIR MENTIONED IT IS THE RESOLUTION AND SO I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE YOUR FOR SITE ABOUT WHAT CAN HAPPEN DOWN THE LINE. BUT ANY OF THOSE THINGS THAT WOULD HAPPEN DOWN THE LINE WOULD SEE THEMSELVES IN A BILL AND A DIFFERENT KIND OF BILL PROBABLY GOING TO MULTIPLE COMMITTEES. YOU TALK A LOT ABOUT SORT OF IMPLEMENTATION WHAT WOULD THIS MEAN. YOU KNOW ULTIMATELY TO THE POINT OF MISS MELENDEZ THIS IS ABOUT YOU KNOW HAVING A CONVERSATION A LARGER CONVERSATION IN WHICH WE ALL HAVE A COLLECTIVE RESPONSIBILITY. WE HAVE SEEN IN MANY OF OUR COMMITTEES THAT WHEN WE ARE LOOKING AT SPECIFIC OR CERTAIN KINDS OF BILLS THAT DEAL WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT OFTENTIMES THERE ARE CERTAIN EXEMPTIONS THAT ARE PLACED. BUT ONCE AGAIN THAT'S WITH FORESIGHT OF A DIFFERENT KIND OF BILL COMING BEFORE. WHO KNOWS WHO'S COMMITTEES YOU KNOW ON THOSE PARTICULAR ISSUES I'M THIS IS NOT SAYING THAT GUN MANUFACTURERS HAVE TO STOP MAKING GUNS THIS BILL DOES THIS RESOLUTION IS INSANE PEOPLE HAVE TO STOP BUYING. THIS BILL IS SPECIFIC AND FOCUSED ON THOSE BANKS THAT HAVE OPEN ACCOUNTS WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA YOU KNOW AS I MENTIONED. YOU KNOW BANK OF AMERICA AND CITIGROUP HAVE TAKEN IT UPON THEMSELVES TO CURTAIL CERTAIN WAYS OF PRACTICES AND POLICIES AS IT RELATES TO DEALING WITH GUN MANUFACTURERS YOU KNOW DELTA HURTS AND DICK'S SPORTING GOODS HAVE ALSO TAKEN MEASURES TO KIND OF STOP OPERATING. BUSINESS AS USUAL IN RESPONSE TO A NUMBER OF THE MASS SHOOTINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED IN THE EIGHTIES AND THE NINETIES OVER TWO HUNDRED CORPORATIONS YOU KNOW HE DID THE CALL FOR DIVESTMENT IN SOUTH AFRICA AND SAID WHAT KIND OF POLICIES AND PRACTICES. CAN WE PUT IN PLACE TO STOP THIS BECAUSE WE'RE HAVING A LARGER CULTURAL CONVERSATION. ABOUT SOUTH AFRICA AND APARTHEID I THINK. I MEAN IF GILROY IF DAYTON OHIO AND CHICAGO ILLINOIS YOU KNOW IF EL PASO TEXAS OF SANDY HOOK I MEAN NAME IS CITY PICK A CITY. IF THOSE SHOOTINGS DON'T SUGGEST THAT WE SHOULD HAVE A COLLECTIVE CONVERSATION. AND ASK FOR A CULTURAL CHANGE AND HOW WE VIEW. THE SECOND AMENDMENT AND HOW WE VIEW THE RIGHT TO PROTECT OUR BUSINESS OUR FAMILY AND HOW WE VIEW THE SAFETY AND SECURITY. OF THE FOLKS THAT WERE WALKING NEXT TO WHEN WE GO TO THE FARMER'S MARKET OR WHEN WE GO TO A BARBECUE AS IT RELATES TO HOW OTHER FOLKS HANDLE GUNS. IF THIS ISN'T THE TIME I DON'T KNOW WHEN IT WILL BE. SOME PEOPLE MAY VIEW THIS AS A THREAT AND HOPEFULLY IT'S AN ENCOURAGEMENT THOUGH. TO SAY HOW CAN WE PLAY A ROLE IN SOLVING THIS LARGER ISSUE BECAUSE NO BILL THAT WE INTRODUCE NOT EVEN THIS RESOLUTION AS THE SILVER BULLET RESPONSE. BUT I BELIEVE THAT WE ALL CAN PLAY A ROLE IN THE LARGER CONVERSATION. AND COME TO SOME PATH FORWARD WHERE YOUNG PEOPLE AREN'T. DUCKING BEHIND DOORS AND UNDER CHAIRS BECAUSE A CAR GOES OFF AND THEY THINK IT'S A GUN. OR BECAUSE PARENTS DON'T HAVE PTSD ABOUT GOING SHOPPING. BECAUSE THEY'RE AFRAID THAT THE RECEIPT CHECKER. IT'S GOING TO GET SHOT IN THEIR CHILD IS STANDING NEXT TO THAT PERSON. THIS IS ASKING INSTITUTIONS THAT NORMALLY HAVE NOT BEEN ASKED TO THINK ABOUT THEIR POWER POP POLICIES AND PRACTICES TO DO SO. THANK YOU AT MEMBERS ANY OTHER QUESTIONS WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND SIGN OUR BARRICADE HAND. I JUST WANNA AND ECHO MISS WORKS COMMENTS REAL BRIEFLY AND THANK THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR BRINGING THE RESOLUTION I THINK IT'S CRAFTED IN A REALLY THOUGHTFUL WAY IT MERELY ASKS THE BANKS THAT WE AS A STATE DO BUSINESS WITH. DOT PRACTICES THAT REFLECT THIS IS THE WORDING OF THE RESOLUTION FACT VALUES OF CALIFORNIA PROTECTING CITIZENS BEFORE PROFIT. ANYTHING TO ASK THE INSTITUTIONS WE DO BUSINESS WITH TO DO WHAT WE DO EVERY DAY. AND WORK FOR THE VALUES OF CALIFORNIA IS NOT TOO MUCH TO ASK. AND I THINK YOU FOR ASKING THEM TO DO SO AND I'M EXCITED TO SUPPORTERS SAY SOMETHING. ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR THOUGHTS. ALL RIGHT SEEN NONE I THINK U. S. A SUMMER AT A THINK THAT TO YOUR OBJECTIVE TO RAISE A DISCUSSION IS EVIDENCED IN TODAY'S HEARING ON THIS RESOLUTION I THINK IT'S ALSO AN IMPORTANT CONVERSATION TO HAVE AND NOT CLEAR WHERE THE DIRECTION WOULD HAVE GONE HAD THIS BEEN A POLICY PER SE. GIVEN THE DYNAMICS BETWEEN THE FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS BUT I DO THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT CONVERSATION TO HAVE ANYTHING TODAY'S HEARING IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF WHY IT'S AN IMPORTANT CONVERSATION TO HAVE. THIS I I'M GONNA ALLOW YOU AT TO CLOSE AND THEN WE WILL CALL THE ROLL BUT I DO WANT TO MENTION THAT THIS RESOLUTION HAS A DO PASSED TO BE ADOPTED TO THIRD READING. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I WANT TO THANK ALL THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE FOR YOUR TIME AND ALSO FOR YOUR COMMENTS I JUST WANT TO CLOSE BY SAYING THAT WE AS THE STATE. OF INSERT OUR VALUES AND POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS IN MANY WAYS WE'VE DONE THAT WITH THE TRAVEL BAN WHEN WE FELT THAT YOU KNOW FOLKS FROM OUR STATE WERE BEING PERSECUTED OR FOLKS ON THE LGBT COMMUNITY WERE BEING PERSECUTED IN OTHER STATES. YOU KNOW WE USED OUR POLICY BULLY PULPIT TO SAY SOMETHING AND WE DID THAT WHEN WELLS FARGO WAS CAUGHT WITH FRAUDULENT ACCOUNTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA MADE A DECISION A VALUE BASED DECISION TO SAY THIS IS HOW WE'RE GOING TO PROTECT. YOU KNOW THE CITIZENS OF THE STATE AS IT RELATES TO THIS FINANCIAL INSTITUTION UNTIL IT GETS ITS ACT TOGETHER SO WE DO THAT IN SMALL AND LARGE WAYS. AND THIS RESOLUTION IS JUST ADDING TO THAT MENU OF CONVERSATIONS AND ENCOURAGEMENT THAT WE'RE ASKING FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO STEP UP AND STEP INTO AS IT RELATES TO GUN VIOLENCE SO I THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS AND YOUR CONCERNS I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE THAT. WE'LL GO AHEAD AND CALL THE ROLL. BUSH'S BE ADOPTED TO THIRD READING LEMOND HI THE MORNING I CAN. OKAY ON MY HEAD BALLOT QUE ONLINE BOOK BOOK I CERVANTES SEVEN TO SITE CHOI.
