00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:30.749
IF THERE IS ILLEGAL ESPECIALLY

00:27:30.815 --> 00:27:32.951
PERPETUAL KINDS OF PROBLEMS WE

00:27:33.018 --> 00:27:33.785
WOULDN'T WANT TO BE SETTING UP A

00:27:33.852 --> 00:27:35.720
SITUATION WHERE THERE IS A

00:27:35.787 --> 00:27:37.122
KNOWING.

00:27:37.188 --> 00:27:39.491
ABUSE OF BARS WHICH WE SEE AGAIN

00:27:39.557 --> 00:27:41.159
AND AGAIN AND AGAIN UNTIL

00:27:41.226 --> 00:27:43.495
THEY'RE CALLED ON OR UNTIL

00:27:43.561 --> 00:27:45.764
THERE'S A LAWSUIT FILED OR UNTIL

00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:47.932
AGAIN THE BORROWER WHO ARE OFTEN

00:27:47.999 --> 00:27:50.568
HAVE REALLY LESS INFORMATION.

00:27:50.635 --> 00:27:52.070
ABOUT HOW ALL OF THESE PIECES

00:27:52.137 --> 00:27:55.206
WORK THEN THE SERVICER DOES.

00:27:55.273 --> 00:27:56.741
THEIR LEAD TO DECISIONS WITHOUT

00:27:56.808 --> 00:27:58.376
KNOWING HOW HARMFUL THOSE

00:27:58.443 --> 00:27:59.644
DECISIONS COULD BE.

00:27:59.711 --> 00:28:01.112
SO IF THERE IF WE BUILD IN A

00:28:01.179 --> 00:28:02.480
RIGHT TO CARRY AND IF WE'RE IF

00:28:02.547 --> 00:28:03.715
WE TAKE AWAY THE PRIVATE RIGHT

00:28:03.782 --> 00:28:04.883
OF ACTION.

00:28:04.949 --> 00:28:06.951
I WORRY IN THIS SPECIFIC CASE

00:28:07.018 --> 00:28:08.586
THAT WE'RE SETTING UP BEHAVIORS

00:28:08.653 --> 00:28:10.522
BY THE SERVICES TO PROVEN TO BE.

00:28:10.588 --> 00:28:12.457
HARMFUL.

00:28:12.524 --> 00:28:14.592
THE BAR IS IN SO MANY INSTANCES

00:28:14.659 --> 00:28:16.094
THAT THAT WOULD YET PERPETUATE.

00:28:16.161 --> 00:28:17.796
THAT SITUATION WOULD FOR THEM SO

00:28:17.862 --> 00:28:19.364
I HAVE YET TO SEE A CONSTRUCT

00:28:19.431 --> 00:28:21.332
THAT REALLY WORKS TO THE BENEFIT

00:28:21.399 --> 00:28:22.801
OF THE BAR WAS IN IN THIS

00:28:22.867 --> 00:28:24.102
SITUATION.

00:28:24.169 --> 00:28:25.670
AND MOST OF THE WOOD NAVVY AT

00:28:25.737 --> 00:28:27.505
THE LARGEST SERVICERS BEING SUED

00:28:27.572 --> 00:28:29.574
IN I BELIEVE EVERY STATE THEY'RE

00:28:29.641 --> 00:28:30.875
OPERATING.

00:28:30.942 --> 00:28:32.277
SO THAT THEY CAN'T COME AS THEY

00:28:32.343 --> 00:28:33.611
TRIED THREE YEARS AGO WHEN WE

00:28:33.678 --> 00:28:34.679
DID THE LICENSING SAY LOOK WE'RE

00:28:34.746 --> 00:28:36.748
THE GOOD GUYS DON'T INCLUDE US

00:28:36.815 --> 00:28:38.349
IN THIS THAN REALLY WAT THAT

00:28:38.416 --> 00:28:39.384
ASSOCIATIONS ASKING FOR IS THAT

00:28:39.451 --> 00:28:40.919
THEY TEND TO BE EXCLUDED FROM

00:28:40.985 --> 00:28:42.454
THE BILL.

00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:44.456
WHICH MAKES NO SENSE SO I I'M

00:28:44.522 --> 00:28:45.523
ALWAYS HAPPY TO TALK TO FACT

00:28:45.590 --> 00:28:47.292
WE'VE TAKEN A NUMBER OF

00:28:47.358 --> 00:28:48.626
AMENDMENTS TO TRY AND WORK WITH

00:28:48.693 --> 00:28:50.195
THE OPPOSITION IN WAYS THAT THAT

00:28:50.261 --> 00:28:50.862
MAKES SENSE.

00:28:50.929 --> 00:28:53.431
WHAT I AM VERY LEERY OF DOING IS

00:28:53.498 --> 00:28:55.133
CREATING MORE ADMINISTRATIVE

00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:57.168
NIGHTMARE OR HEADACHE? FOR THE

00:28:57.235 --> 00:28:59.170
THE BAR WAS WHO GETTING DRAGGED

00:28:59.237 --> 00:29:01.139
AROUND AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN

00:29:01.206 --> 00:29:02.874
AND THE WHOLE TIME THAT THIS

00:29:02.941 --> 00:29:04.175
WORKS AGAINST THEM.

00:29:04.242 --> 00:29:05.543
INTEREST IS STILL GROWING AND

00:29:05.610 --> 00:29:06.744
THEY'RE ENDING UP PAYING MORE

00:29:06.811 --> 00:29:08.613
AND MORE AND MORE BECAUSE OF THE

00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:09.514
PROCESSES [inaudible]

00:29:09.581 --> 00:29:11.282
SO.

00:29:11.349 --> 00:29:13.017
I'M ALWAYS OPEN TO TRY AND FIX

00:29:13.084 --> 00:29:14.652
THE BILL BUT THOSE ARE MY

00:29:14.719 --> 00:29:16.621
CONCERNS ABOUT WEAKENING

00:29:16.688 --> 00:29:18.890

TREASURER'S AND TAX COLLECTORS.

00:50:00.430 --> 00:50:03.266
I WE DON'T QUARREL WITH THE THE

00:50:03.333 --> 00:50:04.935
GOAL IN THE MISSION OF THE

00:50:05.001 --> 00:50:07.137
SPONSORS OF THE BILL AND WE WE

00:50:07.204 --> 00:50:07.904
THINK THAT THEIR INTENTIONS ARE

00:50:07.971 --> 00:50:08.872
GOOD.

00:50:08.939 --> 00:50:09.673
WHAT THE TERMS ARE TAX

00:50:09.740 --> 00:50:11.708
COLLECTORS WANT TO COMMUNICATE

00:50:11.775 --> 00:50:12.876
TO THIS BODY IS THAT?

00:50:12.943 --> 00:50:14.478
THE ASSUMPTION THAT PUBLIC

00:50:14.544 --> 00:50:15.679
DOLLARS.

00:50:15.746 --> 00:50:16.246
UNDER THE CONTROL OF COUNTY

00:50:16.313 --> 00:50:18.181
CHARGERS COULD BE DEPOSITED IN

00:50:18.248 --> 00:50:20.384
THESE BANKS IS IS FALSELY CANNOT

00:50:20.450 --> 00:50:21.518
CONCENTRATE.

00:50:21.585 --> 00:50:24.187
THE POOL DOLLARS IN ONE PLACE

00:50:24.254 --> 00:50:26.189
LIKE A PUBLIC BANK I WE TOOK THE

00:50:26.256 --> 00:50:26.990
EXTRAORDINARY STEP OF

00:50:27.057 --> 00:50:28.558
ESTABLISHING A PREEMPTIVE POLICY

00:50:28.625 --> 00:50:29.960
ON THIS IN DECEMBER TWENTY

00:50:30.026 --> 00:50:31.094
EIGHTEEN WHICH WE DID SHARE.

00:50:31.161 --> 00:50:32.829
WITH THE PROPONENTS PRIOR TO

00:50:32.896 --> 00:50:35.532
THEM -- SECURING AN AUTHOR THE

00:50:35.599 --> 00:50:36.666
GOAL THE AMENDMENT TO TAKE

00:50:36.733 --> 00:50:37.734
INSTEAD OF VERY HIGH BAR SO IT

00:50:37.801 --> 00:50:39.569
WOULDN'T BE SORT OF A **** NILLY

00:50:39.636 --> 00:50:40.003
SET UP.

00:50:40.070 --> 00:50:42.005
BUT WE DO THINK THAT I WOULD BE

00:50:42.072 --> 00:50:44.141
VERY VERY UNLIKELY THAT WOULD

00:50:44.207 --> 00:50:45.776
ACTUALLY YIELD ON THE

00:50:45.842 --> 00:50:47.077
ESTABLISHMENT OF A BANK YOU SONG

00:50:47.144 --> 00:50:48.845
THEN ALICE'S WHICH IS ACTUALLY.

00:50:48.912 --> 00:50:49.679
THE NUMBER OF YEARS IT WOULD

00:50:49.746 --> 00:50:50.981
TAKE TO MAKE IT BE CASH FLOW

00:50:51.047 --> 00:50:53.016
POSITIVE -- THERE'S NOT ENOUGH

00:50:53.083 --> 00:50:54.151
MONEY COUNTY LAND TO SET UP A

00:50:54.217 --> 00:50:55.752
BANKING CASH FLOW FOR THAT MANY

00:50:55.819 --> 00:50:57.287
YEARS AND STILL PAY ALL THE

00:50:57.354 --> 00:50:58.355
REGULAR BILLS THE COUNTIES HAVE

00:50:58.422 --> 00:50:59.022
TO PAY.

00:50:59.089 --> 00:51:00.390
I CAN PROMISE YOU IS THE LOCAL

00:51:00.457 --> 00:51:02.125
GOVERNMENT LOBBYIST OF COUNTIES

00:51:02.192 --> 00:51:03.293
ARE SITTING ON A LOT OF MONEY

00:51:03.360 --> 00:51:04.227
THAT ATTRACTS YOUR ATTENTION

00:51:04.294 --> 00:51:05.529
VERY QUICKLY.

00:51:05.595 --> 00:51:06.730
AND THE LEGISLATURE LIKES TO

00:51:06.797 --> 00:51:07.631
TAKE A GOOD LOOK AT WHAT

00:51:07.697 --> 00:51:08.598
COUNTIES HAVE SO MUCH MONEY IF

00:51:08.665 --> 00:51:09.599
THAT EVER HAPPENS.

00:51:09.666 --> 00:51:10.934
AND SO WE WENT WE DON'T HAVE THE

00:51:11.001 --> 00:51:13.270
MONEY TO CASH FLOW A BANK AND SO

00:51:13.336 --> 00:51:15.372
TO CREATE A SITUATION WHERE IN

00:51:15.439 --> 00:51:16.740
STATUTE THERE'S A TECHNICALLY

00:51:16.807 --> 00:51:18.708
MECHANISM TO GO TRAIN

00:51:18.775 --> 00:51:19.843
ESTABLISHED IT WILL PUT AN

00:51:19.910 --> 00:51:20.577
ENORMOUS ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF

00:51:20.644 --> 00:51:21.945
PRESSURE ON COUNTY TREASURER'S

00:51:22.012 --> 00:51:22.546
THAT REALLY WOULDN'T EVER BE

00:51:22.612 --> 00:51:23.380
ABLE TO PUT.

00:51:23.447 --> 00:51:25.015
THAT MUCH OF THEIR MONEY IN ONE

00:51:25.081 --> 00:51:26.483
THING THE KEY TO PUBLIC

00:51:26.550 --> 00:51:29.052
INVESTMENT IS THE SPREAD OF RISK

00:51:29.119 --> 00:51:30.854
AND TO PUT ALL OF THE COUNTY'S

00:51:30.921 --> 00:51:31.922
MONEY WHICH IS ALSO THE SCHOOL

00:51:31.988 --> 00:51:32.689
MONEY.

00:51:32.756 --> 00:51:35.025
IN ONE ACCOUNT IS IS VERY

00:51:35.091 --> 00:51:36.092
CONCERNING SO WE'RE JUST.

00:51:36.159 --> 00:51:37.461
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT FOLKS

00:51:37.527 --> 00:51:38.829
ARE GOING INTO THIS WITH VERY

00:51:38.895 --> 00:51:40.197
WIDE OPEN EYES ABOUT WHAT

00:51:40.263 --> 00:51:41.932
COUNTIES CAN AND CANNOT DO WITH

00:51:41.998 --> 00:51:43.233
PUBLIC DOLLARS.

00:51:43.300 --> 00:51:44.534
ON AND FURTHER THE STUDIES THAT

00:51:44.601 --> 00:51:46.036
HAVE COME BACK HAVE SHOWN THAT

00:51:46.102 --> 00:51:47.871
IT'S VERY EXPENSIVE TO DO THE

00:51:47.938 --> 00:51:49.639
COMPLIANCE THAT HAS TO BE DONE

00:51:49.706 --> 00:51:51.141
IN ORDER TO KEEP YOUR BANK.

00:51:51.208 --> 00:51:52.342
I IN LINE WITH ALL OF THE LAWS

00:51:52.409 --> 00:51:53.977
FEDERAL AND STATE IS VERY

00:51:54.044 --> 00:51:56.012
EXPENSIVE AND TIME CONSUMING AND

00:51:56.079 --> 00:51:58.148
THE STUDY ITSELF COSTS MONEY AND

00:51:58.215 --> 00:52:05.689
A LOT OF TIME AT THE STAFF LEVEL

00:52:05.755 --> 00:52:05.922
SO WERE.

00:52:05.989 --> 00:52:06.990
ALSO VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE

00:52:07.057 --> 00:52:08.024
PRESSURE TO SPEND THE PUBLIC'S

00:52:08.091 --> 00:52:08.692
MONEY ON A STUDY THAT WE'RE

00:52:08.758 --> 00:52:09.593
PRETTY SURE WE KNOW THE RESULTS

00:52:09.659 --> 00:52:10.160
OF BUT WE MAY END UP BEING

00:52:10.227 --> 00:52:10.727
PRESSURED TO DO THAT ANYWAY

00:52:10.794 --> 00:52:11.761
BECAUSE THE PROPONENTS ARE VERY

00:52:11.828 --> 00:52:13.363
COMMITTED VERY PASSIONATE FOLKS

00:52:13.430 --> 00:52:13.930
AND WE'VE BEEN HEARING ABOUT

00:52:13.997 --> 00:52:14.865
THIS FOR AWHILE.

00:52:14.931 --> 00:52:15.532
SO WE'RE JUST CONCERNED THAT WAS

00:52:15.599 --> 00:52:16.633
THIS IS SETTING UP SOMETHING

00:52:16.700 --> 00:52:17.300
THAT WILL NEVER LEAD TO ANYTHING

00:52:17.367 --> 00:52:19.302
BILL CREATE FALSE HOPE AND FOR

00:52:19.369 --> 00:52:20.003
THOSE REASONS WERE ASKING FOR AN

00:52:20.070 --> 00:52:22.072
ABOUT FACE THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

00:52:22.138 --> 00:52:24.374
THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS.

00:52:24.441 --> 00:52:24.941
MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE

00:52:25.008 --> 00:52:25.775
COMMITTEE ON JASON LANE WITH

00:52:25.842 --> 00:52:27.444
CALIFORNIA BANKERS ASSOCIATION

00:52:27.511 --> 00:52:28.211
THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO

00:52:28.278 --> 00:52:29.880
SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO THE

00:52:29.946 --> 00:52:30.580
MEASURE WE'VE.

00:52:30.647 --> 00:52:32.516
HAD MANY CONVERSATIONS WITH THE

00:52:32.582 --> 00:52:33.917
AUTHOR IN THE PROPONENTS

00:52:33.984 --> 00:52:35.352
ULTIMATELY WE MEAN REMAIN

00:52:35.418 --> 00:52:36.453
FUNDAMENTALLY OPPOSED TO TE

00:52:36.520 --> 00:52:37.888
MEASURE THERE ISN'T A SINGLE

00:52:37.954 --> 00:52:39.155
FEASIBILITY STUDY THAT'S BEEN

00:52:39.222 --> 00:52:42.158
DONE IN ANY CITY IN ANY STATE --

00:52:42.225 --> 00:52:43.560
THAT SHOWS THAT A PUBLIC BANK

00:52:43.627 --> 00:52:46.162
CAN BE SUCCESSFUL THAT WON'T

00:52:46.229 --> 00:52:48.965
HAVE LOSSES -- SAN FRANCISCO HAS.

00:52:49.032 --> 00:52:50.467
FEASIBILITY STUDY THAT'S OVER A

00:52:50.534 --> 00:52:51.902
HUNDRED PAGES LONG IT HAS FOUR

00:52:51.968 --> 00:52:55.205
MODELS ALL FOUR RESULT IN LOSSES

00:52:55.272 --> 00:52:57.207
ONE DOESN'T MAKE MONEY FOR FIFTY

00:52:57.274 --> 00:52:59.009
FOUR YEARS -- I APPRECIATE THE

00:52:59.075 --> 00:53:00.877
FACT THAT CALIFORNIA IS NOW

00:53:00.944 --> 00:53:02.512
TRYING TO IMPORT AND IDEA FROM

00:53:02.579 --> 00:53:04.514
NORTH DAKOTA I DON'T EVER RECALL

00:53:04.581 --> 00:53:07.117
THAT HAPPENING BEFORE -- BUT IN

00:53:07.183 --> 00:53:08.018
THE CASE OF THE BANK OF NORTH

00:53:08.084 --> 00:53:10.053
DAKOTA IT LOST MONEY FOR TWELVE

00:53:10.120 --> 00:53:12.322
YEARS -- AND IT WAS FORMED A

00:53:12.389 --> 00:53:14.424
HUNDRED YEARS AGO ITS GDP IS

00:53:14.491 --> 00:53:16.493
LITERALLY THE SIZE OF OXNARD --

00:53:16.560 --> 00:53:18.461
IT'S 2% OF CALIFORNIA'S GDP SO

00:53:18.528 --> 00:53:22.232
IT'S CERTAINLY NOT AN APPLES TO

00:53:22.299 --> 00:53:22.933
APPLES COMPARISON.

00:53:22.999 --> 00:53:25.669
WE ARE CONCERNED PRIMARILY ABOUT

00:53:25.735 --> 00:53:26.970
SOME OF THE DIALOGUE IS TAKING

00:53:27.037 --> 00:53:28.405
PLACE TODAY IN OTHER COMMITTEES

00:53:28.471 --> 00:53:29.806
ABOUT HOW THIS WILL BE A

00:53:29.873 --> 00:53:32.309
PARTNERSHIP WITH COMMUNITY BANKS.

00:53:32.375 --> 00:53:33.977
AND THAT IT WILL COMPETE THAT'S

00:53:34.044 --> 00:53:35.545
FUNDAMENTALLY FALLS.

00:53:35.612 --> 00:53:36.646
THE PREMISE.

00:53:36.713 --> 00:53:38.982
OF A PUBLIC BANK THE ONLY WAY IT

00:53:39.049 --> 00:53:40.483
OPERATES AND WORKS IS IF IT

00:53:40.550 --> 00:53:41.751
STRIPS.

00:53:41.818 --> 00:53:43.653
DEPOSITS OUT OF PRIVATE

00:53:43.720 --> 00:53:44.955
INSTITUTIONS.

00:53:45.021 --> 00:53:46.957
AND THE RHETORIC AROUND WALL

00:53:47.023 --> 00:53:49.025
STREET I CAN APPRECIATE THAT BUT

00:53:49.092 --> 00:53:50.460
THE REALITY IS WALL STREET BANKS

00:53:50.527 --> 00:53:52.195
ARE NOT GOING TO FEEL THE IMPACT

00:53:52.262 --> 00:53:54.230
OF DEPOSITS BEING TAKEN OUT OF

00:53:54.297 --> 00:53:55.632
PRIVATE ENTITIES.

00:53:55.699 --> 00:53:58.668
IT IS COMMUNITY BANKS STATE

00:53:58.735 --> 00:54:00.103
CHARTERED INSTITUTIONS.

00:54:00.170 --> 00:54:01.338
THAT WILL MOST ACUTELY FEEL THE

00:54:01.404 --> 00:54:04.841
EFFECTS OF HAVING DEPOSITS TAKEN

00:54:04.908 --> 00:54:06.910
AWAY FROM.

00:54:06.977 --> 00:54:08.211
COMMUNITY BANKS WHO DO GOOD SOME

00:54:08.278 --> 00:54:09.412
PRETTY PHENOMENAL STUFF IN THEIR

00:54:09.479 --> 00:54:11.314
COMMUNITIES RELY ON PUBLIC

00:54:11.381 --> 00:54:12.882
AGENCY DEPOSITS AS A SOURCE OF

00:54:12.949 --> 00:54:14.317
LIQUIDITY TO THE CAN GO BACK

00:54:14.384 --> 00:54:15.919
INTO THEIR COMMUNITIES AND MAKE

00:54:15.986 --> 00:54:16.620
LOANS.

00:54:16.686 --> 00:54:18.855
THIS BILL ESSENTIALLY PROPOSES

00:54:18.922 --> 00:54:20.323
TO TAKE THOSE DEPOSITS AWAY.

00:54:20.390 --> 00:54:22.392
THE INDUSTRY DOES NOT MIND

00:54:22.459 --> 00:54:23.960
COMPETITION WE WILL COMMIT.

00:54:24.027 --> 00:54:25.428
IT IS WHEN THAT COMPETITION IS

00:54:25.495 --> 00:54:27.464
UNFAIR AND DONE ON A LEVEL

00:54:27.530 --> 00:54:29.199
PLAYING FIELD THAT GIVES US

00:54:29.265 --> 00:54:31.935
PAUSE IN THIS SITUATION.

00:54:32.002 --> 00:54:34.304
WE ARE CREATING IN THIS BILL A

00:54:34.371 --> 00:54:36.172
CORPORATE ENTITY THAT CORPORATE

00:54:36.239 --> 00:54:37.807
ENTITY IS GOING TO ESCAPE

00:54:37.874 --> 00:54:39.309
TAXATION THAT'S FUNDAMENTALLY

00:54:39.376 --> 00:54:40.810
UNFAIR.

00:54:40.877 --> 00:54:41.511
THE CORPORATE TAX RATE IN

00:54:41.578 --> 00:54:43.613
CALIFORNIA IS EIGHT POINT 8%

00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:45.649
BANKS IN THE STATE PAY TEN POINT

00:54:45.715 --> 00:54:47.450
8% IT IS UNFAIR TO THOSE

00:54:47.517 --> 00:54:48.752
INSTITUTIONS TO TAKE THEIR

00:54:48.818 --> 00:54:50.286
DEPOSITS AND GIVE THEM TO AN

00:54:50.353 --> 00:54:52.022
ENTITY THAT WILL PAY NO INCOME

00:54:52.088 --> 00:54:54.024
TAXES.

00:54:54.090 --> 00:54:55.158
I'VE HEARD THE AUTHOR STAY.

00:54:55.225 --> 00:54:56.760
IN RETORT TO THAT ARGUMENT THE

00:54:56.826 --> 00:54:58.294
CREDIT UNIONS DON'T PAY INCOME

00:54:58.361 --> 00:55:00.130
TAXES BUT THE REALITY IS THE

00:55:00.196 --> 00:55:02.065
IRIS STREET CREDIT UNIONS THE

00:55:02.132 --> 00:55:03.066
WAY THEY DO FOR ONE SPECIFIC

00:55:03.133 --> 00:55:03.733
REASON.

00:55:03.800 --> 00:55:05.001
IS BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO HAVE A

00:55:05.068 --> 00:55:06.670
MEANINGFUL WRITTEN AND FORCE

00:55:06.736 --> 00:55:09.205
COMMON BOND REQUIREMENT FOR ITS

00:55:09.272 --> 00:55:10.106
MEMBERS TYPICALLY INCLUDING

00:55:10.173 --> 00:55:13.076
EMPLOYERS EMPLOYEES BUSINESSES --

00:55:13.143 --> 00:55:14.911
AND MEMBERS ASSOCIATED IN A

00:55:14.978 --> 00:55:16.513
PARTICULAR ORGANIZATION AS FAR

00:55:16.579 --> 00:55:18.782
AS I CAN TELL IN AB FIFTY SEVEN

00:55:18.848 --> 00:55:19.749
ANYONE CAN WALK IN THE STREET

00:55:19.816 --> 00:55:21.317
AND USE A PUBLIC BANK SO THE

00:55:21.384 --> 00:55:22.018
ARGUMENT.

00:55:22.085 --> 00:55:25.021
RELATIVES TAXATION CREDIT UNION

00:55:25.088 --> 00:55:27.123
SIMPLY DOES NOT APPLY.

00:55:27.190 --> 00:55:27.957
WE ARE TO KNOW VOTE ON WHAT THE

00:55:28.024 --> 00:55:30.527
LA TIMES CALLS A MASSIVE WASTE

00:55:30.593 --> 00:55:32.328
OF TIME AND MONEY.

00:55:32.395 --> 00:55:35.799
THANK YOU THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS.

CHAMBER OF COMMERCE WE ARE IN

00:56:16.406 --> 00:56:17.741
OPPOSITION WE ARE.

00:56:17.807 --> 00:56:20.143
EXTREMELY WORRIED ABOUT THE LOSS

00:56:20.210 --> 00:56:21.177
OF COMMUNITY BANKS WERE MOST.

00:56:21.244 --> 00:56:23.279
SMALL BUSINESSES DO THEIR

00:56:23.346 --> 00:56:23.913
BUSINESS.

THE COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS BY

00:56:29.652 --> 00:56:31.488
THE COMMITTEE [inaudible]

00:56:31.554 --> 00:56:35.759
SENATOR DORADO.

00:56:35.825 --> 00:56:37.427
YES I I THINK THOSE ARE.

00:56:37.494 --> 00:56:38.862
SOME OF THE ISSUES RAISED BY THE

00:56:38.928 --> 00:56:41.498
OPPOSITION -- I'D LIKE TO SEE IF

00:56:41.564 --> 00:56:44.334
THERE'S A RESPONSE SURE SOME OF

00:56:44.400 --> 00:56:44.768
THEM.

00:56:44.834 --> 00:56:47.036
BUT AND THEN I HAVE A COUPLE OF

00:56:47.103 --> 00:56:48.138
OTHER.

00:56:48.204 --> 00:56:50.540
SURE I OF THEIR NUMBER VICIOUS

00:56:50.607 --> 00:56:52.208
ARRAYS ON THE TRY TO GO THROUGH

00:56:52.275 --> 00:56:53.943
A FEW OF THEM SO -- THERE HAVE

00:56:54.010 --> 00:56:55.812
BEEN A NUMBER OF ATTEMPTS TO

00:56:55.879 --> 00:56:57.347
STUDY HOW THIS COULD BE DONE.

00:56:57.413 --> 00:56:59.449
AND THERE HAVE BEEN STUDIES THAT

00:56:59.516 --> 00:57:01.851
SHOW THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE

00:57:01.918 --> 00:57:03.820
DIFFICULT AND I AB TOLD THE

00:57:03.887 --> 00:57:05.155
PUBLIC REPEATEDLY ABOUT THIS

00:57:05.221 --> 00:57:07.157
BILL -- THAT THE RISK WITH THIS

00:57:07.223 --> 00:57:09.893
BILL IS NOT THAT WE CREATE A LOT

00:57:09.959 --> 00:57:10.794
OF PUBLIC BANKS THE RISK OF THIS

00:57:10.860 --> 00:57:11.294
BILL.

00:57:11.361 --> 00:57:13.096
IS WE'VE ESTABLISHED SO MANY

00:57:13.163 --> 00:57:16.399
REQUIREMENTS. TO ENSURE THAT --

00:57:16.466 --> 00:57:20.737
WE'RE NOT CREATING -- ANY UNFAIR

00:57:20.804 --> 00:57:21.838
ADVANTAGE FOR PUBLIC BANKS --

00:57:21.905 --> 00:57:23.606
THAT THE RISK IS THAT WE ARE

00:57:23.673 --> 00:57:25.074
UNABLE TO FALL APART A PUBLIC

00:57:25.141 --> 00:57:26.142
BANK THAT A JURISDICTION WOULD

00:57:26.209 --> 00:57:27.677
NOT BE ABLE TO QUALIFY IN

00:57:27.744 --> 00:57:29.145
CHARTER PUBLIC BANK THAT'S REAL.

00:57:29.212 --> 00:57:31.181
THAT BEING SAID WE HAVE MANY

00:57:31.247 --> 00:57:32.348
ISSUES WITH SOME OF THE STUDIES

00:57:32.415 --> 00:57:33.817
THAT HAVE BEEN DONE AND HAPPY TO

00:57:33.883 --> 00:57:35.351
TALK TO YOU ABOUT THAT IN

00:57:35.418 --> 00:57:36.586
GREATER DETAIL IF THAT'S OF

00:57:36.653 --> 00:57:36.853
INTEREST.

00:57:36.920 --> 00:57:38.822
SO THAT'S ISSUE NUMBER ONE ISSUE

00:57:38.888 --> 00:57:40.490
NUMBER TWO AROUND CREDIT UNIONS

00:57:40.557 --> 00:57:41.691
AND COMMUNITY BANKS.

00:57:41.758 --> 00:57:44.160
THE PUBLIC BANK OF NORTH DAKOTA.

00:57:44.227 --> 00:57:45.962
EXPLICITLY STATED A POLICY TO

00:57:46.029 --> 00:57:48.531
WORK IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THOSE

00:57:48.598 --> 00:57:50.500
LOCAL COMMUNITY BANKS SO THE

00:57:50.567 --> 00:57:51.901
IDEA WAS CRITICALLY IN THE

00:57:51.968 --> 00:57:55.705
RETAIL SERVICES AREA -- FOR THE

00:57:55.772 --> 00:57:57.540
PUBLIC AND TO BE A A A BANKS

00:57:57.607 --> 00:57:59.108
BANK.

00:57:59.175 --> 00:58:00.410
I THAT WHERE POSSIBLE -- RETAIL

00:58:00.476 --> 00:58:01.845
SERVICES ARE PROVIDED BY THOSE

00:58:01.911 --> 00:58:04.214
LOCAL INSTITUTIONS AND THAT IS

00:58:04.280 --> 00:58:05.748
THE LANGUAGE IN THIS BILL.

00:58:05.815 --> 00:58:07.550
WE HAVE ASKED THE CREDIT UNIONS

00:58:07.617 --> 00:58:09.052
AND COMMUNITY BANKS WE'VE HAD A

00:58:09.118 --> 00:58:09.853
NUMBER FOR GOOD MEETINGS WITH

00:58:09.919 --> 00:58:10.320
THEM.

00:58:10.386 --> 00:58:11.955
IF THERE ARE ADDITIONAL

00:58:12.021 --> 00:58:13.823
PROPOSALS ON LANGUAGE TO ENSURE

00:58:13.890 --> 00:58:18.695
FOLKS THAT THAT IS SOMETHING WE

00:58:18.761 --> 00:58:19.762
OUGHT TO DO.

00:58:19.829 --> 00:58:22.232
OPEN TO THAT BECAUSE THE THE THE

00:58:22.298 --> 00:58:23.199
THOSE OF US WERE ADVOCATES FOR

00:58:23.266 --> 00:58:24.534
PUBLIC BANKS WE HAVE NO INTENT

00:58:24.601 --> 00:58:25.935
OR NO DESIRE TO UNDERCUT.

00:58:26.002 --> 00:58:27.203
CREDIT UNIONS FOR COMMUNITY

00:58:27.270 --> 00:58:28.805
BANKS BUT WHAT I WILL SAY IS

00:58:28.872 --> 00:58:30.273
THAT THE LARGEST WALL STREET

00:58:30.340 --> 00:58:31.007
BANKS.

00:58:31.074 --> 00:58:34.010
THEY HAVE BY VIRTUE OF THEIR

00:58:34.077 --> 00:58:36.813
PRACTICES OVER THE YEARS -- BEEN

00:58:36.880 --> 00:58:37.981
ABLE TO SWALLOW MANY THIS

00:58:38.047 --> 00:58:40.250
COMMUNITY BANKS IN FACT -- SINCE

00:58:40.316 --> 00:58:41.985
TWENTY PLUS YEARS AGO WE USED TO

00:58:42.051 --> 00:58:44.354
HAVE -- THREE TIMES AS MANY

00:58:44.420 --> 00:58:46.089
COMMUNITY BANKS AS WE DO TODAY

00:58:46.155 --> 00:58:47.390
BECAUSE OF WHAT WALL STREET

00:58:47.457 --> 00:58:49.058
PRACTICES HAVE HAVE ENGAGE AND

00:58:49.125 --> 00:58:50.159
SO ARE.

00:58:50.226 --> 00:58:51.861
PROFOUND HOPE WITH THIS BILL IS

00:58:51.928 --> 00:58:53.396
THAT PUBLIC BANKS WILL BE

00:58:53.463 --> 00:58:55.632
COMPLEMENTARY TO COMMUNITY BANKS

00:58:55.698 --> 00:59:00.403
AND CREDIT UNIONS AND BE ABLE TO

00:59:00.470 --> 00:59:02.038
TO MOVE THAT FORWARD -- WANT TO

00:59:02.105 --> 00:59:02.672
SEE IF THERE ANY OTHER ISSUES

00:59:02.739 --> 00:59:03.506
THAT YOU WOULD LIKE ME TO

00:59:03.573 --> 00:59:05.074
ADDRESS AT THIS POINT THOSE ARE

00:59:05.141 --> 00:59:05.642
A FEW POINTS THAT THAT WERE

00:59:05.708 --> 00:59:11.314
RAISED.

00:59:11.381 --> 00:59:13.983
YEAH THEY ALL OF THE DETAILS OF

00:59:14.050 --> 00:59:18.388
WHAT IT WOULD TAKE THEIR WHAT.

00:59:18.454 --> 00:59:18.588
CAN.

00:59:18.655 --> 00:59:20.757
YOU DO THAT AND I DO THINK THAT

00:59:20.823 --> 00:59:21.524
THERE ARE [inaudible]

00:59:21.591 --> 00:59:23.726
SIGNIFICANT.

00:59:23.793 --> 00:59:24.928
THE WAY THAT HE COULD

00:59:24.994 --> 00:59:25.228
[inaudible]

00:59:25.295 --> 00:59:27.096
ARE TREATED.

00:59:27.163 --> 00:59:28.231
ADDITIONAL BANKS AND THAT

00:59:28.298 --> 00:59:28.531
[inaudible]

00:59:28.598 --> 00:59:31.434
ALWAYS [inaudible] ONE THE

00:59:31.501 --> 00:59:35.872
HEIGHT OF THERE WAS THERE ARE

00:59:35.939 --> 00:59:39.342
DOWN LOW INCOME WORKERS.

00:59:39.409 --> 00:59:41.177
I MEAN THE COLOR.

00:59:41.244 --> 00:59:42.645
WE HAVE BEEN.

00:59:42.712 --> 00:59:45.815
AS FAR AS PROVIDING THE SERVICES

00:59:45.882 --> 00:59:46.149
THAT WE NEED.

00:59:46.215 --> 00:59:47.684
AND THAT CERTAINLY IS A BIG

00:59:47.750 --> 00:59:48.785
DETRIMENT TO EVERYBODY IT'S OUR

00:59:48.851 --> 00:59:49.652
COMMUNITIES THAT ARE HURT BY NOT

00:59:49.719 --> 00:59:53.089
HAVING THE THE BANKING SERVICES --

00:59:53.156 --> 00:59:55.291
ONE COM I SEE HERE IN TERMS OF

00:59:55.358 --> 00:59:57.694
THE THE CHAMBERS OPPOSITION THAT.

00:59:57.760 --> 00:59:59.128
A WE WOULD JEOPARDIZE TAXPAYER

00:59:59.195 --> 01:00:01.030
FUNDS AND POLITICALLY MOTIVATED

01:00:01.097 --> 01:00:02.332
INVESTMENTS.

01:00:02.398 --> 01:00:03.299
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN BY

01:00:03.366 --> 01:00:06.002
THAT -- EXCEPT THAT ON THE

01:00:06.069 --> 01:00:08.237
ISSUES IN OUR COMMUNITIES.

01:00:08.304 --> 01:00:09.672
WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL THEM

01:00:09.739 --> 01:00:11.941
ARE VERY REAL VERY REAL AS FAR

01:00:12.008 --> 01:00:14.243
AS WORKING PEOPLE OUR NEEDS OUR

01:00:14.310 --> 01:00:15.945
NEEDS -- TO HAVE ACCESS TO

01:00:16.012 --> 01:00:17.680
CAPITAL OUR NEEDS TO HAVE ACCESS

01:00:17.747 --> 01:00:20.049
TO LOANS -- AND THEY'RE

01:00:20.116 --> 01:00:22.051
VIRTUALLY ALL THE TRADITIONAL

01:00:22.118 --> 01:00:24.821
BANKS ARE VIRTUALLY NONEXISTENT

01:00:24.887 --> 01:00:26.756
IN MOST OF OUR COMMUNITY SO --

01:00:26.823 --> 01:00:28.691
AND THE I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT'S

01:00:28.758 --> 01:00:30.493
GOING TO BE FULLY REPLACED BY

01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:32.061
JUSTIN ONLINE.

01:00:32.128 --> 01:00:37.133
OF SERVICES SO -- I AGAIN I

01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:38.901
THINK THAT.

01:00:38.968 --> 01:00:40.670
THE THE CONCEPT AS YOU'RE SAYING.

01:00:40.737 --> 01:00:43.239
IS A GOOD ONE OF THE DEVIL'S IN

01:00:43.306 --> 01:00:45.241
THE DETAILS AS FAR AS REALLY

01:00:45.308 --> 01:00:47.643
MOVING IT FORWARD AND I I THINK

01:00:47.710 --> 01:00:49.278
WE OUGHT TO MOVE FORWARD WE ARE

01:00:49.345 --> 01:00:52.448
USING TOO MUCH BY NOT HAVING.

01:00:52.515 --> 01:00:53.783
BANKS THAT REALLY.

01:00:53.850 --> 01:00:56.219
TAKE THE COMMUNITY INTO ACCOUNT

01:00:56.285 --> 01:00:57.520
PRIMARILY.

01:00:57.587 --> 01:00:59.722
AND I DON'T MEAN AT THE RISK OF

01:00:59.789 --> 01:01:01.391
LOSING.

01:01:01.457 --> 01:01:03.092
OF FINANCIALLY.

01:01:03.159 --> 01:01:05.928
THANK YOU AND IF I CAN RESPOND

01:01:05.995 --> 01:01:07.597
TO TO ONE PART OF THAT -- THE

01:01:07.663 --> 01:01:08.931
THE CHAMBER REFERENCE

01:01:08.998 --> 01:01:10.600
POTENTIALLY JEOPARDIZING

01:01:10.666 --> 01:01:12.702
TAXPAYER FUNDS AND HOW.

01:01:12.769 --> 01:01:14.771
BANKS ADDRESS COMMUNITIES -- IN

01:01:14.837 --> 01:01:15.905
AS IF YOU PUT IT.

01:01:15.972 --> 01:01:17.440
THE THE THRUST OF WHY WE'RE

01:01:17.507 --> 01:01:20.209
DOING THIS IS -- WHAT I THINK

01:01:20.276 --> 01:01:21.444
MANY IN CALIFORNIA BELIEVE HAS

01:01:21.511 --> 01:01:23.079
BEEN THE FAILURE AND I REFER TO

01:01:23.146 --> 01:01:24.680
THIS AS THE LARGEST WALL STREET

01:01:24.747 --> 01:01:27.417
BANKS -- THE THE THE LOBBYIST

01:01:27.483 --> 01:01:28.418
FOR THE COMPANY BANKING

01:01:28.484 --> 01:01:30.186
ASSOCIATION IS MENTIONED.

01:01:30.253 --> 01:01:31.888
WHAT WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT I WANT

01:01:31.954 --> 01:01:32.822
TO JUST POINT OUT IT'S BEEN

01:01:32.889 --> 01:01:34.690
INTERESTING TO SEE THE EVOLUTION

01:01:34.757 --> 01:01:35.725
OF?

01:01:35.792 --> 01:01:36.726
THE RHETORIC FROM THE BANKING

01:01:36.793 --> 01:01:38.194
INDUSTRY VIS A. B. R. BILL

01:01:38.261 --> 01:01:40.363
BECAUSE INITIALLY WHAT THEY SAID

01:01:40.430 --> 01:01:42.265
WAS THAT THE BANKING INDUSTRY

01:01:42.331 --> 01:01:43.466
DOES MEET THE PUBLIC'S NAY.

01:01:43.533 --> 01:01:45.268
AND AS YOU HAVE JUST WELL

01:01:45.334 --> 01:01:47.270
ARTICULATED -- IT I THINK IF YOU

01:01:47.336 --> 01:01:48.771
ASK MOST OF OUR CONSTITUENTS

01:01:48.838 --> 01:01:50.773
THEY WOULD NOT SAY THAT THE WALL

01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:52.375
STREET BANKS ARE SERVING THE

01:01:52.442 --> 01:01:54.911
PUBLIC -- WHETHER BE CONSUMERS

01:01:54.977 --> 01:01:55.578

ACCOUNTS OPEN UP IN THEIR NAMES

01:01:59.215 --> 01:02:00.917
OF LOST HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF

01:02:00.983 --> 01:02:02.018
DOLLARS IN INTEREST PAYMENTS.

01:02:02.085 --> 01:02:03.019
HOMEOWNERS WHO'VE BEEN

01:02:03.086 --> 01:02:04.454
VICTIMIZED BY THE MORTGAGE

01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:06.556
FORECLOSURE CRISIS STUDENTS

01:02:06.622 --> 01:02:07.957
VICTIMIZED BY GREED LENDERS

01:02:08.024 --> 01:02:09.525
SMALL BUSINESSES DENIED ACCESS

01:02:15.398 --> 01:02:16.899
BEING INVESTED AGAINST OUR

01:02:16.966 --> 01:02:18.768
VALUES AND FOSSIL FUEL

WITH UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICES AND

01:02:24.340 --> 01:02:25.675
WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS WE NEED TO

01:02:25.741 --> 01:02:26.976
THINK OF AN ALTERNATIVE.

01:02:27.043 --> 01:02:28.277
AND THAT IS WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING

01:02:28.344 --> 01:02:30.480
HERE BUT THAT BEING SAID I

01:02:30.546 --> 01:02:32.381

THAT THIS MAY NOT HAPPEN AND

01:02:45.828 --> 01:02:47.964
THAT MAY BE TRUE -- BUT WE WANT

01:02:49.031 --> 01:02:50.566
POSSIBLE WHICH IS WHY WE'VE

01:02:50.633 --> 01:02:55.972
AGREED TO ALL THESE REQUIREMENTS.

01:02:56.038 --> 01:02:56.472

THIS IS A CITY WITH TWO BILLION

01:04:12.448 --> 01:04:13.883
DOLLARS WORTH OF DEPOSIT THAT

01:04:13.950 --> 01:04:15.117

THEY SAID YOU WERE DOING YOUR

01:04:16.085 --> 01:04:17.653
FAVOR.

01:04:17.720 --> 01:04:18.988
THIS REALLY DOESN'T HELP US A

01:04:19.055 --> 01:04:20.523
NEW ANY WHICH WAY WE'RE

COMPETITIVE RATE.

AND THEY WENT ON TO TALK ABOUT

01:04:26.429 --> 01:04:27.597
WHAT A GREAT DEAL WE'RE GETTING.

01:04:27.663 --> 01:04:29.799
AND I NEVER FORGOT THAT.

01:04:29.865 --> 01:04:31.000
I NEVER FORGOT THAT AND THROUGH

01:04:31.067 --> 01:04:33.035
THE YEARS BEEN RAISED IN A LOW

01:04:33.102 --> 01:04:35.104
INCOME NEIGHBORHOOD BEING RAISED

01:04:35.171 --> 01:04:37.073
IN A PLACE WHERE BUSINESSES.

01:04:37.139 --> 01:04:38.608
DIDN'T GET BANK LOANS AND AND

01:04:38.674 --> 01:04:39.942
THERE ARE THERE ARE SPECIFIC

01:04:40.009 --> 01:04:42.712
PLACES WERE BANKS JUST GENERALLY.

01:04:42.778 --> 01:04:44.981
IN THE PAST AND AND IN MANY

01:04:45.047 --> 01:04:46.949
CASES TODAY DON'T LAN.

01:04:47.016 --> 01:04:49.118
AND OUT OF THE LOOP AND AND WHEN

01:04:49.185 --> 01:04:51.787
YOU LOOK AT STATISTICS. TEN A A

01:04:51.854 --> 01:04:54.056
10% OF EVERY SINGLE BUSINESS

01:04:54.123 --> 01:04:55.725
ASKED FOR A BANK LOAN GETS IT

01:04:55.791 --> 01:04:58.761
AND WE ONLY 10% 90% ARE DENIED

01:04:58.828 --> 01:05:02.465
AND WHAT WHEN YOU ALSO LOOK AT

01:05:02.531 --> 01:05:03.933
THE SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE IF

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:05.568
YOU'RE RICH.

01:05:05.635 --> 01:05:07.303
YOU GET A LOW INTEREST RATE.

01:05:07.370 --> 01:05:08.971
NO COLLATERAL NEEDED.

01:05:09.038 --> 01:05:10.106
NO PROBLEM GETTING ALONE

01:05:10.172 --> 01:05:11.374
AUTOMATIC APPROVAL BUT IF YOU'RE

01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:12.208
POOR.

01:05:12.275 --> 01:05:13.342
COLLATERAL [inaudible]

01:05:13.409 --> 01:05:17.079
THE NILE.

01:05:17.146 --> 01:05:20.683
WE HAVE A SYSTEM THAT LED.

01:05:20.750 --> 01:05:21.217
WE WE NEED TO MAKE IT WORK

01:05:21.284 --> 01:05:22.618
BETTER.

01:05:22.685 --> 01:05:24.053
AND WE NEED TO FIND WAYS TO GET

01:05:24.120 --> 01:05:25.187
BANKS TO INVEST IN OUR

01:05:25.254 --> 01:05:28.858
COMMUNITIES AND AND DO I FEEL

01:05:28.924 --> 01:05:29.925
THE BANKS ARE MAKING GOOD

01:05:29.992 --> 01:05:32.061
EFFORTS I DO.

01:05:32.128 --> 01:05:35.164
I THINK THEY ARE TRYING -- I

01:05:35.231 --> 01:05:36.932
THINK -- THEY ARE MANY CASES

01:05:36.999 --> 01:05:38.000
THERE ARE WORKING ESTABLISHING

01:05:38.067 --> 01:05:39.835
RELATIONSHIPS AND A AND I'M NOT

01:05:39.902 --> 01:05:41.771
HERE TO JUST BE CRITICAL IN SAY.

01:05:41.837 --> 01:05:43.606
BANKS ARE FAILING AT EVERY LEVEL

01:05:43.673 --> 01:05:44.874
BECAUSE I FEEL.

01:05:44.940 --> 01:05:46.542
BANKS ARE DOING A GREAT JOB IN

01:05:46.609 --> 01:05:49.278
CREATING NICHES AND AND AND

01:05:49.345 --> 01:05:50.880
REACHING OUT AND FINDING ALL

01:05:50.946 --> 01:05:53.015
EVERY NOW AND THEN.

01:05:53.082 --> 01:05:56.419
YOU KNOW -- Là I REMEMBER THE

01:05:56.485 --> 01:05:58.120
THE THE REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE

01:05:58.187 --> 01:06:00.089
GOVERNOR THAT WAS -- USED TO BE

01:06:00.156 --> 01:06:01.624
A FORMER BANK OF AMERICA

01:06:01.691 --> 01:06:02.858
EXECUTIVES SAID.

01:06:02.925 --> 01:06:03.726
THAT YOU KNOW ONE YEAR WE

01:06:03.793 --> 01:06:05.294
DEVELOPED A A HUNDRED MILLION

01:06:05.361 --> 01:06:07.663
DOLLAR UND FOR SPECIFICALLY LOW

01:06:07.730 --> 01:06:09.065
INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS.

01:06:09.131 --> 01:06:11.233
AND I SAID YEAH WELL ONE YEAR.

01:06:11.300 --> 01:06:13.035
WHY CAN'T YOU DO THAT EVERY YEAR?

01:06:13.102 --> 01:06:14.537
AND WHAT I CAN NOT ONLY BE A ONE

01:06:14.603 --> 01:06:16.539
TIME PILOT PROGRAM IN HIS

01:06:16.605 --> 01:06:18.040
RESPONSE WAS YOU KNOW WE FOUND.

01:06:18.107 --> 01:06:19.775
IN THAT EFFORT THAT THE DEFAULT

01:06:19.842 --> 01:06:22.044
RATES DID NOT INCREASE.

01:06:22.111 --> 01:06:24.480
THEY ACTUALLY LOWERED.

01:06:24.547 --> 01:06:25.614
WELL WELL INTO UNDERSERVED

01:06:25.681 --> 01:06:27.650
NEIGHBORHOODS ARE DEFAULT RATES

01:06:27.717 --> 01:06:29.618
WENT DOWN.

01:06:29.685 --> 01:06:30.586
AS TO THE WHY CAN'T YOU DO THAT

01:06:30.653 --> 01:06:33.022
ALL THE TIME.

01:06:33.089 --> 01:06:33.856
I HAVE AND I THINK THIS IS JUST

01:06:33.923 --> 01:06:37.259
A OFF ON THAT PRINCIPLE IF IF

01:06:37.326 --> 01:06:38.394
CITIES CAN'T DO THAT THEY

01:06:38.461 --> 01:06:40.229
PROBABLY WON'T.

01:06:40.296 --> 01:06:41.397
BUT THEY WON'T BE DOING ANYTHING

01:06:41.464 --> 01:06:42.565
DIFFERENT THE BANKERS ARE DOING

01:06:42.631 --> 01:06:45.201
NOW AND THAT'S EXCEPT THE IN.

01:06:45.267 --> 01:06:46.702
A TAXPAYER DEPOSITS RIGHT NOW

01:06:46.769 --> 01:06:48.537
BANKS EXCEPT TAX PER DEPOSITS

01:06:48.604 --> 01:06:51.507
THAT'S THE CONCEPT WE DEPOSIT.

01:06:51.574 --> 01:06:53.909
AND AND MAY BE FOR ME.

01:06:53.976 --> 01:06:55.411
IF IF IF WE USE THIS AS A

01:06:55.478 --> 01:06:57.413
MECHANISM MAYBE BANKS WILL COME

01:06:57.480 --> 01:06:58.581
TO THE CITY'S LATER ON SO WE

01:06:58.647 --> 01:07:00.182
WILL INVEST.

01:07:00.249 --> 01:07:00.783
IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOODS AND WE

01:07:00.850 --> 01:07:02.017
WILL PROVIDE LOANS TO THE

01:07:02.084 --> 01:07:04.086
UNDERSERVED.

01:07:04.153 --> 01:07:06.088
AND WE CAN DO IT BETTER THAN YOU.

01:07:06.155 --> 01:07:07.623
AT AND MAYBE WE NEED TO ANSWER

01:07:07.690 --> 01:07:08.257
INJECT A LITTLE BIT OF

01:07:08.324 --> 01:07:10.326
COMPETITION IN THIS PROCESS AND

01:07:10.393 --> 01:07:12.194
AND I BELIEVE I I'M WHAT THE

01:07:12.261 --> 01:07:12.762
BANKERS IT SHOULD BE A FAIR

01:07:12.828 --> 01:07:13.929
PROCESS.

01:07:13.996 --> 01:07:15.364
THE THE MUNICIPAL BANKS IF THEY

01:07:15.431 --> 01:07:17.400
ARE CREATED THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE

01:07:17.466 --> 01:07:20.002
ANY -- OTHER TOOL THE BANKS THAT

01:07:20.069 --> 01:07:21.270
ARE NOT AVAILABLE TO THE BANKS I

01:07:21.337 --> 01:07:22.938
AGREE WITH THEM THERE BECAUSE IT

01:07:23.005 --> 01:07:24.673
WON'T WORK OTHERWISE BUT AT THE

01:07:24.740 --> 01:07:26.675
SAME TIME.

01:07:26.742 --> 01:07:27.843
THIS COULD BE A TREMENDOUS TOOL

01:07:27.910 --> 01:07:29.645
HELPING A LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

01:07:29.712 --> 01:07:31.480
BETTER SERVE THE COMMUNITY AND I

01:07:31.547 --> 01:07:33.149
I BELIEVE IT'LL WORK.

01:07:33.215 --> 01:07:35.050
A AND FOR THE ONE SAID -- CAN'T

01:07:35.117 --> 01:07:36.519
MAKE IT HAPPEN THEY PROBABLY

01:07:36.585 --> 01:07:38.187
WON'T BUT AT LEAST THEY WILL

01:07:38.254 --> 01:07:40.189
HAVE A BETTER RELATIONSHIP WITH

01:07:40.256 --> 01:07:41.357
THE LOCAL BANKING COMMUNITY.

01:07:41.424 --> 01:07:42.925

HI MOM I WILL ALSO ADD MAYON

01:07:51.434 --> 01:07:53.035
THOUGHT TO THIS ISSUE I WANT TO

01:07:53.102 --> 01:07:55.004
FIRST COMMEND BOTH AUTHORS

01:07:55.070 --> 01:07:57.907
BECAUSE THIS IS A HERCULEAN.

01:07:57.973 --> 01:08:00.142
TASK TO MOVE THIS MEASURE FORD

01:08:00.209 --> 01:08:02.511
IT'S A CONCEPT I THINK IT'S TIME

01:08:02.578 --> 01:08:04.413
IS LONG OVERDUE -- I THINK

01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:06.282
YOU'VE HEARD FROM THE COMMITTEE

01:08:06.348 --> 01:08:08.217
MEMBERS TO CHALLENGES THAT WE

01:08:08.284 --> 01:08:09.084
FACE IN MANY OF THESE

01:08:09.151 --> 01:08:11.053
COMMUNITIES AS IN THIS NOT TO

01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:12.855
BEAT UP THE BANKS AT ALL BUT TWO

01:08:12.922 --> 01:08:14.824
THINGS YOU WILL NOT FIND.

01:08:14.890 --> 01:08:16.792
AND LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES

01:08:16.859 --> 01:08:18.394
PHARMACIES AND BANKS.

01:08:18.461 --> 01:08:19.995
AND IT'S REALITY YOU WILL NOT

01:08:20.062 --> 01:08:22.031
FIND A PHARMACY OR BANK IN A LOW

01:08:22.097 --> 01:08:24.099
INCOME COMMUNITY SO IF YOU'RE

01:08:24.166 --> 01:08:26.669
NOT WILLING TO LOCATE ONE THERE

01:08:26.735 --> 01:08:28.871
THEN IF YOU HAVE A COMMUNITY AND

01:08:28.938 --> 01:08:29.205
MAKE.

01:08:29.271 --> 01:08:30.906
A MUNICIPALITY IS WILLING TO

01:08:30.973 --> 01:08:32.341
INVEST THEIR MONEY THERE AND YES

01:08:32.408 --> 01:08:34.043
THERE'S REST AND I TO HAVE BEEN

01:08:34.109 --> 01:08:35.711
A LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIAL AND I

01:08:35.778 --> 01:08:38.881
DO HAVE THOSE CONCERNS.

01:08:38.948 --> 01:08:41.050
ON LOCAL JURISDICTION OVER

01:08:41.116 --> 01:08:41.750
STANDING THEIR LEVEL OF

01:08:41.817 --> 01:08:43.352
EXPERTISE I COME FROM THE CITY

01:08:43.419 --> 01:08:44.920
OF GUARDINO WERE WE ALMOST WENT

01:08:44.987 --> 01:08:48.090
BANKRUPT AND NINETEEN NINETY

01:08:48.157 --> 01:08:49.158
SEVEN BECAUSE WE STARTED A

01:08:49.225 --> 01:08:51.961
MUNICIPAL INSURANCE CORPORATION.

01:08:52.027 --> 01:08:54.597
AND SOUL I'VE SHARED MY BIT OF

01:08:54.663 --> 01:08:57.466
CAUTION TO BOTH AUTHORS AS TO

01:08:57.533 --> 01:08:59.902
WHY SOME OF THE I'M IMAGE THAT

01:08:59.969 --> 01:09:01.737
WE ASK FOR TO KIND OF SAFEGUARD

01:09:01.804 --> 01:09:03.672
AND MAKE SURE THE COMMUNITY

01:09:03.739 --> 01:09:04.406
HOUSING VOICE AND THE CITY AND

01:09:04.473 --> 01:09:05.207
THOSE.

01:09:05.274 --> 01:09:07.977
BUT TO STAY HERE THE OPPOSITION

01:09:08.043 --> 01:09:09.078
AND CONTINUES TO SAY BASED ON

01:09:09.144 --> 01:09:10.513
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING THAT IT

01:09:10.579 --> 01:09:11.947
PROBABLY WON'T WORK THEN WHY THE

01:09:12.014 --> 01:09:12.715
OPPOSITION.

01:09:12.781 --> 01:09:14.083
I A IT SEEMS LIKE MANY OF YOU

01:09:14.149 --> 01:09:16.719
BELIEVE THAT.

01:09:16.785 --> 01:09:18.354
IT WILL NOT WORK SO [inaudible]

01:09:18.420 --> 01:09:19.455
LET IT.

01:09:19.522 --> 01:09:20.856
HI I MEAN I I DON'T THINK WHY

01:09:20.923 --> 01:09:22.825
WOULD WE NOT LEAST.

01:09:22.892 --> 01:09:23.826
LET IT SEE IF IT COULD FLY OR

01:09:23.893 --> 01:09:25.995
NOT BUT I THINK IT'S A CONCEPT

01:09:26.061 --> 01:09:28.664
IT'S LONG OVERDUE -- I I THINK

01:09:28.731 --> 01:09:31.700
THERE IS A NEED AND I TALKED TO

01:09:31.767 --> 01:09:33.168
SOMEONE DURING THIS ISSUE AND IF

01:09:33.235 --> 01:09:35.471
SOMEONE WHO WALKED INTO A BANK I

01:09:35.538 --> 01:09:37.907
WILL NOT IDENTIFY THAT BANK BUT

01:09:37.973 --> 01:09:39.508
THEY HAVE REPRESENTATIVES HERE.

01:09:39.575 --> 01:09:41.644
AND THEY WALKED IN TO GET CHANGE

01:09:41.710 --> 01:09:43.779
FOR A HUNDRED DOLLAR BILL.

01:09:43.846 --> 01:09:45.447
AND THEY WERE DENIED CHANGE FOR

01:09:45.514 --> 01:09:46.448
A HUNDRED DOLLAR BILL BECAUSE HE

01:09:46.515 --> 01:09:47.516
DIDN'T HAVE AN ACCOUNT AT THAT

01:09:47.583 --> 01:09:49.718
BANK.

01:09:49.785 --> 01:09:51.353
IF BANKS CAN MAKE CHANGE.

01:09:51.420 --> 01:09:53.522
I'M I'M I'M I'M I'M REALLY LOS

01:09:53.589 --> 01:09:56.425
THERE BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT A BANK.

01:09:56.492 --> 01:09:58.394
ALWAYS DID AS A KID WHEN I WAS

01:09:58.460 --> 01:10:01.096
GROWING UP AND IT AND IF IT WAS

01:10:01.163 --> 01:10:01.997
YOUR COMMUNITY BANK.

01:10:02.064 --> 01:10:04.400
YOU WITH EXPECT THAT SO I THINK

01:10:04.466 --> 01:10:06.502
THERE IS A NEED FOR THIS CONCEPT

01:10:06.569 --> 01:10:09.438
AND I'M WILLING -- TO SUPPORTED

01:10:09.505 --> 01:10:11.473
AS IT MOVES FORWARD -- YES IT'S

01:10:11.540 --> 01:10:12.575
A LOT OF WORK IN THIS DOUBLES IN

01:10:12.641 --> 01:10:16.445
THE DETAILS BUT I I THINK -- IT

01:10:16.512 --> 01:10:18.781

01:10:18.847 --> 01:10:21.750

ATTEMPTS EIGHT YEARS AGO I

01:10:40.369 --> 01:10:41.737
ALMOST THOUGHT OF NOT DOING THIS
