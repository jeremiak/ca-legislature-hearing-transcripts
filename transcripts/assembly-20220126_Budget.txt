WE CERTAINLY NEED TO BE ADDRESSING A MENTAL HEALTH HOMELESSNESS WHICH IS MENTIONED BY THE CHAIR AS WELL- I WOULD ALSO.

SO I KNOW YOU AND I SHARE A FOCUS ON OVERSIGHT I KNOW THAT THAT THAT YEARS COMMITTED TO THAT WE NEED TO ENSURE. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE SPENDING OF TAXPAYER DOLLARS BUT I WOULD CRTAINLY THAT THE REVENUE COMING.

ON ANOTHER BUDGET YEAR HOPEFULLY WILL BE LESS ATTIC AS AS- AS LAST YEAR BUT I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT BUT BEFORE TO WORK WITH MY COLLEAGUES ON THE COMMITTEE SAID AS WELL AS WELL. ALONG WITH ADMINISTRATION THANK MISTER. BY SURE OTHER.

CURRENTLY WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO- IDENTIFY AND SPEND A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER RESOURCES. BUT IF YOU TALK TO MANY PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE THEY HAVEN'T. FELT THE IMPACT YES WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE IMPACTS COULD BE FELT BY ALL THE PEOPLE. THAT WOULD LIKE TO HELP. THEM WITH THAT LET'S TURN IT OVER TO. THIS ERICA LEAD. OR WITH THIRD PARTY FINANCE. AFTERNOON CHARTING BY STIR FONG AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ERICA LEE WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND I'M REALLY PLEASED TO PRESENT. TO THE COMMITTEE THE TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET- THIS BUDGET BUILDS ON LAST YEAR'S EXTRAORDINARY INVESTMENTS THAT. PROTECTED LIES RIGHT KOBE NINETEEN THE PANDEMIC BOB PROVIDED IMMEDIATE SUPPORTS TO FAMILIES AND SMALL BUSINESSES. AND ADDRESS THE IMMEDIATE AND LONG TERM IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE. THE STATE IS CONTINUING TO EXPERIENCE RECORD ECONOMIC GROWTH AND THAT ON TOP OF OUR DECADE OF FISCAL PRUDENCE. REALLY GIVES US AN OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD ON OUR PAST INVESTMENTS AND STRENGTHEN THE FOUNDATION FOR A FUTURE WITH A CONTINUED FOCUS ON SUPPORTING A MORE EVEN RECOVERY FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS THE CHURCH IS MENTIONED. ON THE TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET TAKES ON SOME OF THE STATE'S BIGGEST CHALLENGES NAMELY COVER NINETEEN CLIMATE CHANGE HOMELESSNESS. THE COST OF LIVING AND KEEPING OUR STREETS SAFE. THE BUDGET PRESENTATION TODAY BEGINS NOT SURPRISINGLY WITH KOBE NINETEEN. TO TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET INCLUDED ONE POINT SEVEN FIVE BILLION FOR DIRECT RESPONSE EFFORTS. AND SINCE THE PASSAGE OF THE BUDGET HOWEVER CALIFORNIA HAS DEALT WITH THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCIES AROUND THE DELTA VARIANTS AND NOW WE FIND OURSELVES IN THE MIDST OF THE OMICRON VARIANT. ADDITIONALLY MORE CHILDREN ARE NOW ELIGIBLE FOR VACCINES AND THE STATE HAS REALLY RAMPED UP ITS EFFORTS TO GET MORE CHILDREN VACCINATED. IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE RISK OF SPREADING. THE GOVERNOR ORIGINALLY REQUESTED EARLY ACTION FROM THE LEGISLATURE FOR COVERT RESPONSE EFFORTS- WITH AN ADDITIONAL ONE POINT FOUR BILLION IN SPENDING AUTHORITY FOR THE CURRENT YEAR HOWEVER THESE COSTS WERE FINALIZED PRIOR TO KNOWING THE FULL SCOPE OF ACTIVITIES NECESSARY TO RESPOND TO A CRIME- THE- THE ADMINISTRATION NOW ASKS FOR AN ADDITIONAL. BILLION ON TOP OF THAT TO SUPPORT EXPANDED TESTING EFFORTS- TAKE SALARY MAXINE AND BOOSTER SHOTS. AND ADDRESS HOSPITAL AND MEDICAL SEARCH. THE ADMINISTRATION CONTINUES TO WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND THE DETAILS OF THIS EARLY BUDGET ACTION. ALONG WITH OTHER COMPONENTS THAT I WILL DISCUSS SHORTLY- THE ULTIMATE GOAL IS TO BE ABLE TO SAVE OUR LIVES. BY IMMEDIATELY AND EFFECTIVELY RESPONDING TO THE EVER INVOLVING KOBE PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS. THE TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET BUILDS ON SIGNIFICANT COMMITMENTS MADE IN PRIOR YEARS- IT TOO FOR THEIR SUPPORT CALIFORNIA PARENTS WITH YOUNG CHILDREN AND TO REDUCE OVERALL COST OF LIVING. THE BUDGET AS THIRTY SIX THOUSAND CHILD CARE SLOTS ON TOP OF THE ONE HUNDRED AND TEN THOUSAND SPOTS FROM LAST YEAR OLD MARCHING TOWARDS A TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND- NUMBER BY TWENTY FIVE TWENTY SIX. ADDITIONALLY THE BUDGET IS ONE BILLION TO IMPLEMENT THE FIRST YEAR OF UNIVERSAL T. K. LAST YEAR'S BUDGET MADE A ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOWN PAYMENT TO EXPAND AFTER SCHOOL AND SUMMER PROGRAMS. AND THE BUDGET THIS YEAR CONTINUES THESE OPPORTUNITIES WITH THREE POINT FOUR BILLION I'M GOING FOR EXTENDED DAY AND YOUR LONG INSTRUCTION. AND ANOTHER ALMOST BILLION DOLLARS TO SUPPORT INTEGRATING ARTS AND MUSIC INTO ENRICHMENT PROGRAMS. IN HIGHER EDUCATION THE BUDGET PROPOSES MULTI YOUR CONTACTS WITH THE UC AND CSU. AND A MULTI YEAR ROADMAP FOR THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES. THE STATE WILL PROVIDE 5% BASED AUGMENTATIONS FOR THE UC AND CSU. AND SEGMENTS ARE EXPECTED TO EXPAND ACCESS FOR CALIFORNIA STUDENTS ADDRESS AFFORDABILITY ISSUES. AND CLOSE EQUITY GAPS AMONG MANY OTHER THINGS. ADDITIONALLY THE BUDGET FOR THE SUPPORTS EFFORTS TO REDUCE THE OVERALL COST OF ATTENDANCE THROUGH THE SECOND YEAR OF FUNDING FOR STUDENT HOUSING THAT SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION- AN ADDITIONAL ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY THOUSAND CAL GRANTS TO. COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS. AND FUNDING FOR THE FIRST YEAR OF A REVAMPED MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP. IN THE AREA OF HEALTHCARE AS MENTIONED CALIFORNIA HAS ALREADY ADVANCED MULTIPLE MEASURES. IN RECENT YEARS TO APPROVE HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY AS WELL AS ACCESS TO THIS BUDGET CALIFORNIA WILL BE THE FIRST STATE TO REALIZE UNIVERSAL. ACCESS TO HEALTH COVERAGE FOR ALL- REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRATION STATUS AND THIS COVERS THE GAP OF ADULTS AGE TWENTY FOUR TO FORTY NINE. CALIFORNIA IS ALSO UNIQUELY POSITIONED TO EXPAND ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES WHILE ALSO TACKLING CLIMATE CHANGE. FIRST THE BUDGET PROPOSES TWO NEW GREEN TAX CREDITS TO INSERT MOR CALIFORNIA COMPANIES TO WORK TOWARD MITIGATING THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE. ADDITIONALLY WE PROPOSE A WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND STAKEHOLDERS TO DEVELOP A REGULATORY FRAMEWORK AROUND THE CAMP PRODUCTION. ON THE THEME OF THE METAL THAT'S PLENTIFUL IN CALIFORNIA AND VITAL FOR ELECTRIC CAR BATTERIES CALIFORNIA IS POISED TO BECOME A GLOBAL LEADER IN DEPLOYING ENVIRONMENTALLY SOUND TECHNOLOGY TO PRODUCE LITHIUM. ALONG WITH RENEWABLE ELECTRICITY AND BECOME A WORLD CLASS BATTERY MANUFACTURER LEADING TO GET JOBS- EXPANDING ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY IN THE SALTON SEA REGION AND CALIFORNIA MORE BROADLY. IN ADDITION THE BUDGET INCLUDES OVER TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS IN INFRASTRUCTURE RELATED INVESTMENTS TO PREPARE AND PROTECT CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES. FROM CLIMATE CHANGE THESE INVESTMENTS WILL SPUR MORE ECONOMIC GROWTH AND CREATE THOUSANDS OF JOBS. SUPPORTING CALIFORNIA'S SMALL BUSINESSES WILL LIKELY WILL LIKEWISE DRIVE MORE ECONOMIC GROWTH AND JOB CREATION DURING RECOVERY- ADAMS LAST YEAR SMALL BUSINESS PACKAGE THIS YEAR THE BUDGET PROPOSES REMOVING LIMITS I'M NOT OPERATING LOSS AND TAX CREDIT SOMETHING THAT WAS IMPLEMENTED DURING THE RECESSION- EXPANDING STATE TAX CONFORMITY TO QUALIFY CALIFORNIA RESTAURANTS AND VENUES THAT RECEIPT OF FEDERAL RELIEF FRIENDS. SUPPORTING SMALL BUSINESSES ON THE WAIT LIST FOR THE SMALL BUSINESS RELIEF GRANT PROGRAM. AND LASTLY THE BUDGET INCLUDES THREE BILLION TO REDUCE THE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE TRUST FUND THAT. WHILE SUPPORTING OUR SMALL BUSINESSES IS VITAL FOR STATES CONTINUED ECONOMIC GROWTH WE MUST ALSO INVEST IN OUR DIVERSE WORKFORCE. AS ANNOUNCED YESTERDAY THE LEGISLATURE THE MINISTRATION HAVE DEVELOPED A FRAMEWORK TO EXTENSIBLE MODEL PAID SICK LEAVE AS PART OF AN EARLY ACTION. THIS WILL PROTECT OUR WORKERS THEIR FAMILIES AND THEIR WORKPLACE FROM THE SPREAD OF COBIT. FRAMEWORK ALSO SUPPORTS OUR SMALL BUSINESSES ADDING MANY OF THE PROPOSED BUSINESS- SUPPORTS- I JUST PRESENTED ADDITIONALLY WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF SMALL BUSINESS THROUGH THE BUDGET. IN ADDITION TO THE REQUEST FOR EARLY ACTION FOR PAID SICK LEAVE THE BUDGET PROPOSES STRATEGIES TO TRAIN WORKERS FOR JOBS. THAT ARE CRITICAL TO CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMIC GROWTH AND TO MEET A GROWING DEMAND FOR HEALTHCARE WORKERS AS WELL AS TEACHERS. AND BUILDING ON LAST YEAR'S HISTORIC FIFTEEN BILLION DOLLARS IN CLIMATE INVESTMENTS THE BUDGET INVEST OVER TWENTY BILLION AND ALIGNED EFFORTS. IN CLIMATE TRANSPORTATION HOUSING ENERGY AND HEALTH TO RESPOND TO THE CLIMATE CRISIS. AND MOVE FORWARD TO MEET OUR CLIMATE GOALS. FOR THE SECOND TIME I WILL HIGHLIGHT TWO OF THE MANY IMPORTANT PROPOSALS. ON THE BUDGET INCLUDES NINE POINT ONE BILLION IN TRANSPORTATION FUNDING THAT WILL SUPPORT CONTINUED DEVELOPMENT OF THE NATION'S. FIRST ELECTRIFIED HIGH SPEED RAIL. AS WELL AS REGIONAL TRANSIT AND RAIL PROJECTS BICYCLE PEDESTRIAN PROJECTS AND CLIMATE ADAPTATION PROJECTS. IS FUNDS WILL YIELD THOUSANDS OF NEW JOBS IN CALIFORNIA. FOR HOUSING THE BUDGET INCLUDES AN ADDITIONAL ONE POINT FIVE BILLION TO ACCELERATE THE DEVELOPMENT OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING ESPECIALLY NEAR DOWNTOWN AREAS- AND AREAS NEAR TRANSIT AND SERVICES IN ORDER TO MITIGATE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. SO IN CONCLUSION THIS IS A VERY QUICK SYNOPSIS OF SOME OF THAT SIGNIFICANT AND EXCITING PROPOSALS AND THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. AS ALWAYS THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET SERVES AS A LAUNCHING PAD FOR DISCUSSION AND DEBATE WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUE CONVERSATIONS THROUGHOUT THE SPRING STARTING WITH OUR EARLY ACTION CLASS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH LOOK FORWARD TO QUESTIONS- AFTER US THE L. A. OKAY STAGE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU NOT GONNA MISTER PANIC. EIGHT MONTHS THANK YOU ALL RIGHT. MISTER CHAIR AND MR VICE CHAIR AND MEMBERS FOR INVITING ME TO PARTICIPATE ALONG WITH MY COLLEAGUES AT THE L. A. O. FOR TODAY'S HEARING. I WILL WALK THROUGH A HANDOUT THAT I PUT UP ON THE SCREEN AND ALSO THAT YOU HOPEFULLY HAVE AND IT'S AVAILABLE AT ELADIO DOT CA DOT GOV. FOR ANYONE FOLLOWING ALONG AND AFTER MY REMARKS MY COLLEAGUES AND I WILL BE HAPPY TO RESPOND TO ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE- I JUST WANTED TO KNOW IF IT'S ALL RIGHT BEFORE GOING INTO THE HAND OUT. THAT TODAY YOU'LL HEAR ME DISCUSS THE ESTIMATED SURPLUS STATE APPROPRIATIONS LIMIT OR THE GAL THAT IS AGAIN SORRY. OUR COMMENTS ON THE GOVERNOR'S MAJOR PROPOSALS AND THEN A BRIEF WORD ON THE BUDGET CONDITION AND RESERVES THROUGHOUT THOSE COMMENTS I THINK YOU'LL SEE A THEME EMERGE THAT WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO KEEP IN MIND HOW TO PRESERVE LEGISLATIVE FLEXIBILITY. AND HOW TO CONTINUE TO STRENGTHEN THE STATE'S FISCAL RESILIENCE ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF THE ONGOING UNCERTAINTY RELATED TO THE PANDEMIC RISING AND- VARIOUS OTHER CHALLENGES THAT ARE OUT THERE. AND I JUST YOU KNOW WHEN WE TALK ABOUT RESILIENCE AND RESERVES I'D LIKE TO UNDERSCORE THAT IT'S NOT FOR THEIR OWN SAKE IT'S NOT FOUR OR OR AN ABSTRACT NOTION OF FISCAL PRUDENCE. IT'S SO THAT THE STATE CAN REMAIN IN A STRONG POSITION TO UPHOLD THE COMMITMENTS THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS MADE PREVIOUSLY. AND SO THAT THE STATE CAN SUSTAIN VITAL PROGRAMS IN THE EVENT OF ANOTHER UNEXPECTED SHOCKER DOWNTURNS. SO IS THAT ALL JUMPED INTO THE TO THE HAND OUT HERE MOVING TO PAGE ONE- THE FIGURE ON THE FIRST PAGE. HERE DISPLAYS HOW THE GOVERNOR ALLOCATES THE DISCRETIONARY SURPLUS AS YOU KNOW WE RUN OUR OWN CALCULATIONS AND WE FOUND THAT THE GOVERNOR HAD ACCORDING TO OUR MEASUREMENTS AT TWENTY NINE BILLION DOLLAR DISCRETIONARY SURPLUS TO ALLOCATE. THIS IS SOMEWHAT HIGHER THAN THE TWENTY ONE BILLION IN DISCRETIONARY SURPLUS IDENTIFIED BY THE ADMINISTRATION. NOW SINCE WE BOTH BOTH OF OUR OFFICES DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IN LA- FOLLOW. SIMILAR METHODOLOGY FOR CALCULATING THE SURPLUS I'LL POINT OUT THAT WHERE WE DIFFER IS THAT IN- SOME OF THE SOME OF THE ITEMS THAT WE COUNT AS DISCRETIONARY SPENDING WHICH MEANS IT CONTRIBUTES TO THE SURPLUS. THE ADMINISTRATION COUNTS AS PART OF THE STATE'S EXISTING SPENDING BASE SO FOR EXAMPLE IN NOTABLE ONE IS WE CONSIDER THE THREE AND A HALF BILLION OR SO- PROPOSED TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURES SPENDING- IN THAT PACKAGE AS DISCRETIONARY. THUS INCREASING THE SURPLUS BY THAT MUCH IN THAT WHERE IS THE ADMINISTRATION INCLUDED THAT AS PART OF THE SPENDING BASELINE. SO WHILE THE ADMINISTRATION'S APPROACH IS REASONABLE. WE CAN OUT- SUCH AMOUNTS AS PART OF DISCRETIONARY SURPLUS OUT OF DEFERENCE TO YOU IN THE LEGISLATURE IN OTHER WORDS FOR US IT'S NOT JUST A TECHNICAL ACCOUNTING DIFFERENCE. OUR APPROACH YOUR RECOGNIZES IN ORDER SPENDING. THE LEGISLATURE MUST MAKE AN APPROACH. MUST APPROPRIATE THE FUNDS FIRST SO YOU MAY DECIDE THAT YOU CHOOSE TO END IT HERE TO THESE PREVIOUS AGREEMENTS THAT ARE REFLECTED IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL BUT IT'S STILL A CHOICE ON YOUR PART. AND THAT'S WHY WE RECOGNIZE IT AS SUCH. SO WHEN I TURNED TO THE TWO FIGURES ON THE SLIDE- THE TOP ONE IS SHOWING THE GOVERNOR'S ALLOCATION OF THE TWENTY NINE BILLION DOLLAR SURPLUS. US SEVENTEEN POINT THREE BILLION OF THAT IS GOING FOR A ONE TIMER TEMPORARY PROGRAMMATIC SPENDING WE CONSIDER THREE YEARS OR LESS TO BE A TEMPORARY. PROGRAM COMMITMENTS. SIX POINT TWO BILLION IS FOR REVENUE REDUCTIONS THREE POINT ONE BILLION GOES TO THE STATE'S DISCRETIONARY RESERVE THE SPECIAL FUND FOR ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY. TWO BILLION. IN ONGOING SPENDING SO I WOULD NOTE THAT WE ESTIMATE OUT WILL INCREASE TO OVER FIVE BILLION BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE TWENTY SIX. AND THEN THERE IS FIVE HUNDRED NINETY BILLION IN DEBT REPAYMENT ON TOP OF THE FOUR BILLION YEN. DARREN LIABILITY PAYMENTS REQUIRED BY PROPOSITION TWO. ALSO I WOULD NOTE THAT THE PROPOSAL INCLUDES ALMOST TWENTY FIVE BILLION IN GENERAL PURPOSE RESERVES WHICH WE INCLUDE IN THAT- THE BUDGET STABILIZATION ACCOUNT SAFETY THE SFUAND THE SAFETY NET RESERVE. THE SECOND FIGURE HERE IS REFERENCING THE PROFIT PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT SIDE OF THE BUDGET. AND ARE IT WITHIN THIS SIDE. EARLY BECAUSE OF HIGHER REVENUES RESULTING IN A HIGHER MINIMUM GUARANTEED THERE IS ALMOST EIGHTEEN BILLION IN PROPOSED NEW SPENDING. AFTER COVERING THE ROUGHLY FOUR BILLION CAUGHT IN COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH A FIVE POINT 3% COLA. B. THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES ALLOCATING ABOUT THIRTEEN BILLION AND IN RESOURCES AS SHOWN IN THIS FIGURE SEVEN BILLION FOR ONE TIME ACTIVITIES. THREE POINT FOUR BILLION FOR THE EXPANDED LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES PROGRAM WHICH WAS INITIATED IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET. THERE'S A ONE POINT TWO BILLION ADJUSTMENT FOR DISTRICTS- WRIST IN RESPONSE TO THE DECLINE OVERALL DECLINING ENROLLMENT- EFFECTS THAT THAT WOULD HAVE ON THEIR FUNDING OTHERWISE. AND THEN ONE POINT ONE POINT THREE BILLION YEAH AND- OTHER ONGOING. INCREASES IN SPENDING. AND LIKE WHAT THE OTHER SIDE- JUST NOTE THERE'S- ALMOST TEN BILLION IN THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT RESERVE UNDER THE RULES OF PROPOSITION TWO SO THAT'S THE LARGEST BALANCE- TO DATE IN THAT- IN THAT RESERVE. THE WORD ON THE STATE APPROPRIATIONS LIMIT- WHICH AFFECTS HOW THE LEGISLATURE CAN USE REVENUES THAT EXCEED A CERTAIN THRESHOLD REQUIREMENTS STEMMING FROM EXCEEDING THE STATE APPROPRIATIONS LIMIT IS A TWO YEAR CALCULATION. AND SO FOR THE PRIOR YEAR IN THE CURRENT YEAR SO TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET REFLECTS THAT STATE APPROPRIATIONS EXCEED THE LIMIT BY TWO POINT SIX BILLION COMBINED ACROSS THOSE TWO YEARS REQUIREMENTS FROM THIS WHICH WOULD ACTUALLY BE MORE THAN THAT EXCEPT FOR THE BUDGET PROPOSAL INCLUDES ABOUT SIX POINT THREE BILLION IN PROPOSALS THAT MEETS OUR REQUIREMENTS THUS LOWERING APPROPRIATIONS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO THE LIMIT BY THAT AMOUNT. THE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET DOES NOT INCLUDE A SPECIFIC PROPOSAL FOR DEALING WITH THESE ACCESS REVENUES AND INDICATES THAT THE ADMINISTRATION WILL PUT FORWARD A PLAN AT THE TIME OF THE MAY REVISION. HERE YOU KNOW WE WOULD ENCOURAGE THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER DEVELOPING A PLAN FOR MEETING THIS HOUR REQUIREMENT BEFORE ME. THE MAIN REASON FOR THAT IS THAT DELAYING THE FORMATION OF THE PLAN REDUCES LEGISLATIVE FLEXIBILITY. FOR INSTANCE IF REVENUES CONTINUE TO OUTPACE BUDGET ESTIMATES IN THE LEGISLATURE PREFERRED TO ADDRESS A PORTION OF THE OF THE REQUIREMENT COMING FROM FROM THE CELL BY LOWERING TAXES. AND REALLY EARLIER ACTION WOULD BE BETTER THAN WAITING UNTIL MAY IN ORDER FOR IT TO AFFECT YOU EIGHT THAT TYPE OF THE POLICY. AS WE LOOK TO THE TWENTY TWENTY. TWENTY TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE BUDGET YEAR. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL REFLECTS ROOM OF ABOUT WERE UNDER THE LIMIT BY ABOUT FIVE POINT SEVEN BILLION- AND HERE AGAIN WE WOULD NOTE THAT THERE ARE AROUND TWELVE BILLION IN PROPOSALS THAT REDUCED REVENUES ARE APPROPRIATIONS SUBJECT TO THE LIMIT SO THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT- PART OF THE- OVERALL PROPOSAL. TAKING IT IN ITS TOTALITY THERE IT YOU KNOW AND LOOKING AT THE TWENTY NINE BILLION DOLLAR SURPLUS THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL HAS ABOUT SEVENTEEN BILLION DOLLARS IN PROPOSALS THAT ADDRESS CELL REQUIREMENTS. WITH THE OTHER TWELVE BILLION OR SO IN PROPOSAL'S NOT ADDRESSING CELL THE CELL REQUIREMENTS ARE NOT EXCLUDABLE FROM THE CELL. THESE INCLUDE EIGHT POINT FIVE BILLION IN- IN SPENDING AND THEN THREE POINT ONE BILLION THAT GOES TO THE S. S. B. U. WHICH IS AS WE NOTED BEFORE IT DOES NOT- IS NOT EXCLUDABLE FROM THE CELL JUST YOU KNOW IT'S JUST GOING INTO THE S. AND P. YOU SEE. WHAT THIS ALL MEANS IS THAT IF YOU WEIGH YOUR CHOICES ON THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS BROADLY SPEAKING ARE IN ORDER TO KEEP APPROPRIATIONS BELOW THE LIMIT IN TWENTY TO TWENTY TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. ANY OF THE SEVENTEEN BILLION YEN SALIX MOVABLE PROPOSALS- THAT THEY GOT THAT THE LEGISLATURE OPTS TO REJECT REALLY MUST BE REPLACED BY ANOTHER ALLOCATION. THAT IS SELL EXCLUDABLE ALSO. I'M SORRY KIND OF WHITE IT TO THE BIG. ESSENTIALLY ON THE OTHER HAND ANY OF THE TWELVE BILLION THAT ARE NOT EXCLUDABLE IF THE LEGISLATURE WERE WERE TO REJECT SOME OF THOSE YOU COULD REPLACE THOSE WITH OTHER NOT EXCLUDABLE- ALLOCATIONS WARRICK'S WILL DOUBLE ALLOCATION SO IN A WAY HAVE MORE FLEXIBILITY WITH THAT SUCH THAT SIDE OF THE- TOTAL- THEN. ALL RIGHT LET ME JUST TURN BRIEFLY HERE TO THE- COMMENTS WE HAVE ON THE GOVERNOR'S SPENDING PROPOSALS OVERALL WE THINK THAT THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO KEEP IN MIND THE MAGNITUDE OF LAST YEAR'S COMMITMENTS AND DEDICATE SOME PORTION OF THE EARLY PART OF THE BUDGET PROCESS TO CHECKING IN ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THOSE CHOICES. JULY IN SOMEWHAT CONSISTENT WITH REMARKS MADE BY THE CHAIR AND VICE CHAIR IN THE OPENING STATEMENTS RELATED TO THIS WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE BE CAUTIOUS ABOUT CREATING NEW PROGRAMS WE'RE SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDING EXT EXISTING ONES. WE THINK IT MAY BE APPROPRIATE TO BE YOU THE ONGOING PANDEMIC IN AS AS A LONG TERM ISSUE AND CONSIDER THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS RECOGNIZED. THIS POTENTIAL REALITY. THE NEXT TWO PAGES I'M NOT GOING TO GO THROUGH IN DETAIL AT ALL- BUT THEY REALLY ARE JUST A LISTING OF SOME OF THE MAJOR PROPOSALS AND SOME OF OUR- ADDITIONAL COMMENTS ON THOSE AND WE'VE BEEN ANALYSIS ON VARIOUS OF THESE NOW BUT YOU'D SEE UNDER EACH OF THE PROPOSED. MAJOR PROPOSALS THAT. SOME OF OUR COMMENTS REALLY YOU KNOW IT ECHO THE THEMES THAT I'VE BEEN MENTIONING. SO IF YOU LOOK AT K. FOURTEEN EDUCATION FOR EXAMPLE. THIS SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE ALREADY IMPLEMENTING MANY NEW PROGRAMS AND REQUIREMENTS IN. SO IT'S YOU KNOW THEIR CAPACITY TO IMPLEMENT EVEN MORE NEW PROGRAMS IS PROBABLY LIMITED. WE RECOMMEND THEREFORE FUNDING FEWER OF THE NEW ONE TIME PROGRAMS IN PARTICULAR IN PRIORITIZING THOSE TO DRESS YOUR PRIORITIES AND THE UNDERLYING PROBLEMS THAT THAT CANNOT BE ADDRESSED WITH WITH EXISTING PROGRAMS. AND TO SO THOSE ARE THE TWO PAGES ON THE MAJOR PROPOSALS MERIT JUST LIKE TO CLOSE ON THE LAST TWO PAGES YOU'RE MENTIONING OUR VIEWS ON THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AS IT RELATES TO THE STATE'S OVERALL BUDGET CONDITION. YOU MAY RECALL IN RECENT PREVIOUS YEARS WE'VE DESCRIBED THE ADMINISTRATION'S REVENUE ESTIMATES AS POSSIBLE THOUGH A BIT CAUTIOUS RELATIVE TO OURS. NOW IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THE REVENUE ESTIMATES ARE MUCH HIGHER THAN BEFORE OVER THE THREE YEAR BUDGET WINDOW- THAT YOU KNOW IS CONSIDERED. THE ADMINISTRATION HAS RAISED REVENUE ESTIMATES BY FORTY ONE BILLION FROM THE BUDGET ACT AND AT THIS POINT THERE ARE MUCH CLOSER TO WHAT WE WOULD CONSIDER THAT MEDIAN LIKELIHOOD OUTCOME OR MIDDLE OF THE ROAD SCENARIO. AND SO YOU KNOW WHILE WELL THESE ESTIMATES ARE REASONABLE THEY'RE CLOSE TO OURS YOU KNOW SO WE THINK THEY'RE REASONABLE- THE YOU KNOW THE FACT IS BY BY USING A HIGHER REVENUE ESTIMATE THERE'S JUST LESS LIKELIHOOD FOR AN UPSIDE ADJUSTMENT- UPSIDE REVISION LATER ON SUCH AS SOMETHING TO BE COGNIZANT OF. AND THIS IS ACTUALLY REALLY BECOMES IMPORTANT WHEN WE BEGAN LOOKING THROUGH TO THE ADMINISTRATION'S. MULTI YOU'RE A GENERAL FUND FORECAST BECAUSE IT THE MULTI YEAR FORECAST SHOWS NEGATIVE STFU BALANCES. YEAH AND- BEGINNING IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR AND FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST TO RISE AND SO ESSENTIALLY THIS MEANS THAT- THE ADMINISTRATION SPENDING PROPOSALS EXCEED ITS OWN ESTIMATES OF THE STATE'S FUTURE BUDGET CAPACITY. AND SO THAT'S- YOU KNOW STE. ONE COMMENT. FINALLY ON THE FINAL PAGE HERE WE DO HAVE A COMMENT ON RESERVES FIRST I WILL JUST POINT OUT HAT WE DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN THE GENERAL PURPOSE RESERVES WHICH AS I SAID AT THE BEGINNING IT INCLUDES THAT THE BUDGET STABILIZATION ACCOUNT. THE SFU IN THE STICKING OUT RESERVE WE DIFFERENTIATE THAT GROUP FROM THE PROP NINETY EIGHT RESERVE. WELL THE PROP NINETY EIGHT RESERVE IS VERY HELPFUL FOR MAINTAINING EDUCATION FUNDING IN A DOWN YEAR THOSE BALANCES REALLY WOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE TO HELP ADDRESS A BUDGET PROBLEM SO WE DON'T THINK OF THEM AS GENERALLY AVAILABLE FOR GENERAL PURPOSE IN THAT SAME WAY. AND WHO AS WE LOOK AT THE TOTAL OF THE GENERAL PURPOSE RESERVE THAT ABOUT TWENTY FIVE BILLION. NOMINALLY THAT'S VERY HIGH HISTORICALLY HIGH BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THEM AS A SHARE OF THE BUDGET WHICH I THINK IS THE IMPORTANT WAY TO LOOK AT THEM THEY WOULD REMAIN SOMEWHAT BELOW PRE PANDEMIC LEVELS. AND SO FOR THAT REASON WE DO THINK THAT. IT WARRANT YOUR CONSIDERATION ACCORDING. TO GET MORE INTO THE GENERAL PURPOSE RESERVES ON AN OPTIONAL BASIS. SO I'LL STOP THERE AND BE HAPPY TO RESPOND TO ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE GOING TO TURN OVER TO THE COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. THIS CALL. UP VOTE I THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'LL ALSO WITH ELIO AND THEN GO TO THE PREMIER FINANCE IN TERMS OF WHAT YOU JUST SAID- ABOUT- WHICH FUTURE MULTI YOUR REVENUE PROJECTIONS AND THEN YOUR YOUR CAUTION TO US ABOUT- THE NEED FOR MORE OVERSIGHT AND- FOCUSING ON ON. THAT INSTEAD OF CREATING ADDITIONAL NEW PROGRAMS- I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD TALK EAT EAT YOU GOTTA HINTED AT IT BUT I GUESS THEY WILL ASK MORE BLUNTLY THERE AGAINST THAT'S THE SENATE. MEMBERS OF OVER A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME WITH THE REVENUE PROJECTIONS AND WHAT THE BUT THE GOVERNOR PRESS FOR POST. WELL I THINK THERE'S JUST A CONCERN IN THE SENSE THAT- YOU KNOW THE MULTI YEAR FORECAST SHOULD REPRESENT OUR- BEST ESTIMATES OF WHAT WE THINK THE FUTURE HOLDS AND SO IF THE MULTI YEAR FORECAST IS SHOWING NOT JUST AN OPERATING DEFICIT. WHERE CURRENT YEAR REVENUES. PRINT YOUR EXPENDITURES BUT ACTUALLY A NEGATIVE SFC YOU BALANCE. HELLO THAT'S ACTUALLY A BUDGET THAT YOU WOULD BE ALLOWED TO PASS UNDER THE CONSTITUTION'S OUR BALANCED BUDGET REQUIREMENT SO WHAT IT SAYS TO ME IS THAT THERE'S WE'RE WE'RE STARTING OFF FROM A PLACE WHERE WE ASSUME THAT THERE WILL BE A CHANGE FROM THE CURRENT FORECAST THAT EITHER REVENUES WILL BE HIGHER. OR EXPENDITURES WILL BE LOWER AND THAT'S CERTAINLY POSSIBLE- BUT AS I SAID THE REVENUES HAVE BEEN ADJUSTED UPWARD WHICH IS VERY REASONABLE BUT IT JUST MEANS THAT THERE'S LESS- THE CONTROL FOR AN ADDITIONAL UPSIDE REVISION AFTER YOU'VE ALREADY MOVED THEM UP TO MORE OF THIS. MEDIA AND LIKELIHOOD OUT. SO YEAH I THINK I THINK THAT'S- WHAT I WOULD SAY TO THAT MR FONG THAT'S SPOKEN LIKE A TRUE ANALYST HE GIVEN A LOT OF WORDS ON THAT ONE- AB. S. AS ESSENTIALLY THERE'S A LOT OF ASSUMPTIONS AND WE NEED TO BE I GUESS THE BROADER I GUESS THE CONCLUSION IS THAT YOU WANT YOU WOULD RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE MAINTAIN SOME FLEXIBILITY. INTERNET IS IF IT'S IF IT'S IN TERMS OF LOOKING OUT TO THE FUTURE. YES WE THINK SO OKAY. I APPRECIATE THAT THANKS THANK YOU. MOVING TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. I'M LOOKING AT IT THROUGH THE LENS OF WHAT THE L. LEO HAS SAID BUT CERTAINLY LOOKING AT IT FROM THE CRISES THAT THE CHAIR AS OUTLINED I FIRST WANT TO TALK ABOUT I GUESS DROUGHT ANDIN WATER INFRASTRUCTURE AT CERTAINLY. I AM. I HAVE BEEN VERY OUTSPOKEN ABOUT THE NEED TO ACCELERATE WAR WATER STORAGE IN OUR STATE THE GOVERNOR HAS BEEN PROMOTING A SIX BILLION DOLLAR DROP PACKAGE. IN THIS PROPOSAL MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THERE IS AN ADDITIONAL SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR THIS BUDGET YEAR TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION HASN'T BEEN FULLY FLESHED OUT YET BUT THERE ISN'T. ANY NEW FUNDING FOR WATER STORAGE AND I JUST KINDA WANT TO UNDERSTAND AS THE GOVERNOR TALKED ABOUT INFRASTRUCTURE AS THE GOVERNOR TALKS ABOUT LONG TERM PLANNING WHERE IS THE URGENCY I GUESS WHEN IT COMES TO. ADDITIONAL WATER STORAGE. SURE THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION ASSEMBLY MEMBER FONG- I YEAH THE FIRM THERE'S A AN ADDITIONAL SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION AND ON TOP OF THE ONE BILLION THAT WAS. ALLOCATED AS PART OF LAST YEAR'S- BUDGET AGREEMENT THE TOTAL FIVE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS PACKAGE- AS TO STORAGE I'M GONNA TURN THAT QUESTION OVER FOR MORE DETAILS TO MY COLLEAGUES- CRYSTAL. THANK YOU. SH GOOD AFTERNOON CRYSTAL SURE TO WHAT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- SIMILAR TO LAST YEAR THE ADMINISTRATION HAS TAKEN A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO WATER RESILIENCY IN THE STATE- AS OUTLINED BY THE GOVERNOR'S WATER PORTFOLIO- IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IS REFLECTIVE OF THAT APPROACH BY CONTINUING TO INVEST- INCLUDING THAT. THE SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION BUT MORE SPECIFICALLY THE FOR THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION- FOR WATER CONSERVATION GROUNDWATER RECHARGE AND INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS- THAT IN ADDITION TO THE EXISTING PROPOSITION ONE. FUNDING FOR WATER STORAGE PROJECTS COLLECTIVELY HELP US TOWARD- OUR GOALS OF PROVIDING A HIGHER WATER RELIABILITY AND QUALITY- AND SO I OULD JUST I WOULD JUST SAY THAT THE ADMINISTRATION CONTINUES TO- APPROACH WATER RESILIENCY FROM THAT COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH SHOULD DEFINITELY SEE- WATER STORAGE AS BEING A PART OF THAT COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY. SO PROP ONE WAS ALREADY THERE AND I GUESS THAT'S UNANSWERED AS GIVEN TO ME A LOT BUT SETTING ASIDE PROP ONE. WHICH IS STILL NEEDS TO BE ALLOCATED IS THERE ANY ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO ACCELERATE. THE WATER STORAGE PROJECTS THAT ARE PENDING BEFORE'S BEFORE THE STATE. THERE IS NOT EDUCATIONAL FUNDING SPECIFICALLY FOR WATER STORAGE PROJECTS AS PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S. BUDGET AT AS I MENTIONED- WE CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THAT THAT PROVIDING INVESTMENTS IN SOME OF THESE OTHER AREAS INCLUDING WATER CONSERVATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT- AS WE- TACKLE SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WE'RE FACED WITH. DROUGHT AND CLIMATE CHANGE- BUT I MUST BE TO PROVIDE JUST A LITTLE BIT OF AN UPDATE ON THE EXISTING PROPOSITION ONE FUNDING WHICH I THINK IS- IMPORTANT- SPECIFICALLY THE SEVEN PROPOSED PROP ONE PROJECTS THAT AND RECENTLY PASSED. A KEY HURDLE AND RECEIVING FEASIBLE BY THE CALIFORNIA WATER COMMISSION I'M THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS AND SO KNOW THAT YOU KNOW THOSE PROJECT PROPONENTS ARE GOING TO BE MOVING INTO- COMPLETING THE SOME OF THE FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL DOCUMENTS AND SOME OF THE OTHER I'M REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE. THAT ARE NEEDED AND SO- YOU KNOW THE TIMELINE HAS HAS- BEEN BEEN MOVING AT A PACE THAT I UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW HAS HAS TAKEN SEVERAL YEARS THESE ARE. LOCALLY DRIVEN PROJECTS THAT HAVE QUITE A FEW I'M A DIFFERENT SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES. AND HOW IT IS I'M INCLUDING PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTING AND THAT SORT OF THING SO THE ADMINISTRATION CONTINUES TO SUPPORT. THOSE THOSE SEVEN WATER STORAGE PROJECTS- THAT ARE ELIGIBLE FOR THE TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION. LOOK AYE AYES I JUST I HOPE DEMONSTRATION WILL FAST TRACK THOSE PROJECTS I HOPE THAT AS THE WE DEVELOP OUR BUDGET IN THE AND THE LEGISLATURE THAT WE WOULD PUT SOME MORE MONEY A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY. INTO GETTING THOSE PROJECTS COMPLETED ESPECIALLY AS WE ENTER. INTO ANOTHER DROUGHT YEAR- JUMPING TO WILDFIRE AND THE CHAIR AGAIN MENTIONED THIS IN AND- HE IS CORRECT- WE NEED TO- REACH OUR GOAL OF FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES OF A TREATMENT. LET ME FIRST ASK IN AND OUR LAST OVERSIGHT HEARING. THAT WE HAD IN DECEMBER- THERE WAS DISCUSSIONS. ABOUT REPORTS ON THE UP OF WHAT THE STATE HAS DONE- THAT WAS REQUIRED UNDER AB FOURTEEN NINETY TWO THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE DELIVERED BY THE LEGISLATURE. AND WE WERE TOLD. THAT THE LEGISLATURE WE GET THOSE REPORTS BY JANUARY THE FIRST BECAUSE JANUARY. AND I UNDERSTANDING THAT WE HAVEN'T THEM SO IS THERE UPDATE WHEN WE WOULD GET THOSE. REPORTS ONLINE- WHAT THE STATE HAS DONE WHEN IT COMES TO WILDFIRE MANAGEMENT AND PREVENTION. REQUIRED BY. LAW ALL. YES ASSEMBLY MEMBER FONG IS THERE ANY OF THEIR STEVEN BANKS AND COULD YOU PLEASE RESPOND MISTER. GOOD AFTERNOON STEVEN BEDS WITH BARBARA FINANCED- I'M SORRY I DON'T HAVE AN EXACT DATE FOR YOU RIGHT NOW WE ARE WORKING WITH THAT THAT'S RESOURCES AGENCY IN ITS DEPARTMENTS TO GET INFORMATION PUT TOGETHER AND READY TO THE L. A. O. N. AND LET'S STAFF. IN RESPONSE TO THAT. SO THE REPORTS ARE. SUBMITTED FOR THE PARTS ARE DONE. I DON'T BELIEVE THE REPORTS YOU'RE REFERRING TO ARE COMPLETE THIS POINT OKAY. AND I THINK THIS GOES BACK TO. THE YOU KNOW THE NEED FOR OVERSIGHT WHEN WE ARE ALLOCATING FUNDS BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S BEING DONE AND THESE REPORTS ARE A CRITICAL- TO IT TO UNDERSTANDING WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS CURRENT YEARS BUT- THAT NOT KERN YOU'RE OUTSIDE. THAT THE BUDGET PROPOSAL HAS SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS SO IT'S SIX HUNDRED MILLION FOR THIS UPCOMING YEAR AND SIX SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS. AFTER THAT. VOTE THIS PAST YEAR WE DEDICATED ONE POINT FIVE BILLION FOR WILDFIRE PREVENTION SO WHY DO WE GO FROM ONE POINT FIVE BILLION TO SIX HUNDRED MILLION. IS THERE A REASON WHY. SO LAST YEAR'S PACKAGE ACTUALLY INCLUDED ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE. I'M FISCAL YEAR THAT'S PART OF THE WORLD QUITE FIVE BE REFERENCING AND THEN FOR THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO FISCAL YEAR INCLUDED AT JUST UNDER BILLION DOLLARS- SO WHAT WHAT WE HAVE DONE IS ASSESSED KIND OF. WHAT WE THINK IS BILLS THAT IT CHIEF OF ALL BUT AMBITIOUS LEVEL FUNDING TO CONTINUE THE SAME PROGRAM PRIMARILY THE SAME PROGRAMS THAT RAN LAST YEAR'S PACKAGE. AND WE BELIEVE THAT THE CONTINUING THE CHOICES LAST YEAR'S PACKAGE INCLUDED CONTINUOUS PREPARATION OF TURNER NINE DOLLARS EACH YEAR AFTER. RIGHT SOME ONGOING FUNDING FOR. FOREST HEALTH AND- FIRE PREVENTION. THREE TWENTY EIGHT TWENTY NINE SO THAT SIX HUNDRED MILLION REFERENCED INCLUDES THAT TWO HUNDRED MILLION. AND THEN- PROPOSAL INCLUDES AN ADDITIONAL FOUR HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND. THAT WE BELIEVE IT IS- LIKE I SAID INVESTORS IN A T. MOBILE LEVEL FUNDING TO CONTINUE THE PROGRAMS THAT WERE INCLUDED IN THIS PACKAGE SO THE SIX HUNDRED MILLION IS TWO HUNDRED FROM GIGI R. F. AND FOUR HUNDRED OF THE GENERAL FUND. CORRECT OKAY. I THINK IT'S JUST. LIKE WE HAVE TO ACCELERATE OUR- FIRE WILDFIRE FUEL MANAGEMENT. THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE OUR STATE AND TO GO FROM. ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN A CALENDAR YEAR TO SIX HUNDRED MILLION I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO RE EVALUATE- IN TERMS OF JUMPING TO. THE TAX RELIEF MEASURES I KNOW THAT THAT MAY BE ABLE EARLY ACTION ITEM BUT WHAT WE CAN DISCUSS IN EARLY ACTION BUT I WAS WONDERING IF THERE'S BEEN CONVERSATIONS ABOUT- I KNOW THAT WITH THE LAST TIME WE TALK ABOUT CONFORMITY THE TIMING WAS WAS OFF AND A LOT OF ACCOUNTANTS AND IN SMALL BUSINESSES WHO ARE TRYING TO FILE- WERE CAUGHT UP IN AND JUST THE- THE CONFUSION THERE SO I WAS WONDERING IN TERMS OF ALL THESE. YOU KNOW PASSED ENTITY TAX CONFORMITY IS AND THE DEDUCTIONS THAT ARE BEING DISCUSSED- IS IT ARE THERE PLANS TO EXPAND THESE FRAMEWORKS IN EARLY ACTION SO THAT TAXPAYERS CAN MEET THE UPCOMING MARCH FIFTEENTH TAX FILING DEADLINE. YES I'M GONNA TURN THE QUESTION OVER TO J. CHAMBERLAIN FOR SOME DETAILS. YES ST GENERAL PUBLIC FINANCE SO YEAH- WE ARE- THE EASY I'LL- I BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE DISCUSSIONS RIGHT NOW THAT WOULD. ENACT THOSE DEPLOYED- TO UNLOCK THOSE PROVISIONS AND AFFECTED TWENTY TWENTY ONE TAX YEAR THE TO ENACT THOSE PRIOR TO MARCH FIFTEENTH. BY THE DEADLINE OKAY UP ICE I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THAT- IN TERMS OF THAT THE YOU AYE DADDY. AND THIS STEP THE STATUS OF THE STATE- FUND. WHAT IS THE CURRENT ESTIMATE OF FRAUDULENT PAYMENTS FROM THE STATE FUND I UNDERSTAND IT MAYBE NORTH OF A BILLION DOLLARS BUT IS THERE DO YOU HAVE AN ESTIMATE. ON THE STATE FOR ALL OF THE STATE SIDE. CHARLTON A QUESTION TO CHRIS COOK. CHRIS COOK WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I DON'T HAVE THAT FIGURE OF THE STATE DEAD IN FRONT OF ME- I COULD FOLLOW UP WITH WITH STAFF AND PROVIDE THAT NUMBER FOR YOU HELPFUL I UNDERSTAND IT TO BE ABOUT. A LITTLE OVER A BILLION EVEN THOUGH THE FULL ET DE- FRAUD NUMBER IS PROBABLY ABOUT TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS. AND SO WHEN THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES TO PAY DOWN THE U. I. DEBT. BY THREE BILLION MY UNDERSTANDING IT'S A BILLION DOLLARS IN THE TWENTY TWENTY TWO. YEAR AND THEN IT'S A PLEDGE TO DO TWO BILLION DOLLARS THE FOLLOWING YEAR IS THAT CORRECT. THAT IS CORRECT OKAY SO THEN THE BILLION WOULD PROBABLY COVER THAT THE FRAUDULENT PAYMENTS. IN THE STATE OF THE STATE FUND AND THEN ARE THERE ANY ASSURANCES THAT THE TWO BILLION WOULD MATERIALIZE IN THE FOLLOWING YEAR. OR IS THAT SOMETHING WE'RE JUST GONNA HAVE TO HOLD YOU GUYS. ACCOUNTABLE FOR. WELL THAT'S A COMMITTEES SIMILAR TO OTHER- YEARS. BUDGETARY EARLY WE'RE SCORING THAT IN THE IN BUDGET YEAR PLUS ONE AND SO THAT'S THE COMMITMENT TO MAKE THAT INVESTMENT. AND THOSE WILL BE THAT AND AS WE MOVE THROUGH THE PROCESS THIS YEAR- THAT WILLBE DISCUSSED FURTHER BY THE COMMITMENT AT THIS TIME IS TEND TO INVEST THAT TWO BILLION IN BUDGET YEAR PLUS ONE. OKAY IN TERMS OF THE INFILL FUNDS THAT WORD TO YOU- TO INCENTIVIZE AT INFILL DEVELOPMENT. HOW IS THE FORMULA GOING TO BE DEVELOPED IS THERE GOING TO BE IS IT IS IT GOING TO GO TO THE L. A. AND- IN THE BAY AREA WHICH OF CERTAINLY HAS NEEDS BUT I WANTED TO UNDERSTAND HOW- URBAN CENTERS IN IN IN IN THE CENTER VALLEY. AND OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE WOULD THEY HAVE ACCESS TO THOSE FUNDS TO. YES CHRIS COOK WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AGAIN- FOR THE IG FINDS- FURTHER DETAILS WILL BE. RELEASED AS PART OF THE TRAILER BILL PROCESS BUT GENERALLY SPEAKING. THE AND FUNDS ARE INTENDED TO BE- ISSUED SIMILAR TO HOW THEY WERE FOR THE PRIOR IG PROGRAMS- BUT ONE THING TO NOTICE IS THAT- WITH THE I AG FUNDS MORE RECENTLY THERE IS AN- URBAN. I AM SORRY A RURAL SET ASIDE FOR THESE FUNDS. AND SO THERE IS A RECOGNITION THAT THERE'S NEEDS THROUGHOUT THE STATE TO PROVIDE THESE INFILL DOLLARS. AND FURTHER AT HCD IS GOOD ABOUT- BEING COGNISANT OF THE NEEDS THROUGHOUT AND THEY TRY TO EQUITABLY DISTRIBUTE THESE DOLLARS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. IN ALL REGIONS. YEAH AND CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THAT- IN TERMS OF SUPPLY CHAIN I KNOW- I KNOW MY COLLEAGUE FROM LONG BEACH IS- BEEN VERY ACTIVE IN THIS SPACE. NOW IN THE LAST. PORTS HEARING I BELIEVE THE ADMINISTRATION INDICATED THAT THERE WOULD BE SOME DECISION BY DECEMBER FIFTEENTH ABOUT EXCESS LAND TO BE USED TO KIND OF RELIEF CAPACITY. IS THERE FUNDING IN THIS BUDGET TO. FORTIES INLAND PORTS ARE THESE IN LAND FACILITIES TO KIND OF RELIEVE SOME OF THE PORT CONGESTION ON THESE EMPTY CONTAINERS. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE QUESTION ASSEMBLY MEMBER- BUT WE DO HAVE A TWO POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS SUPPLY CHAIN SLASH. RECALL LAW AND I'M GOING TO ASK TREES THAT COVER TO EXPLAIN SOME OF THE DECLINE IN RESPONSE TO YOUR QUESTION. HEY GOOD AFTERNOON THREE TO COVER WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THE TWO POINT THREE BILLION ERICA EFER TO IS MADE UP OF THE FOLLOWING COMPONENTS- AND WE CAN PROVIDE ADDITIONAL DETAIL ON THESE ALBUMS AND THERE'S ADDITIONAL DETAILS ON THAT BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL THAT POSTED ON A WEBSITE. AND WE ABOUT ONE POINT TWO BILLION SPECIFIC OR PORT RELATED PROJECTS THAT WOULD INCREASE GOODS MOVEMENT CAPACITY WE HAVE A RELATED- YOUR EMISSION VEHICLE- IS GETTING YOUR MACHINE PUT IN A NUMBER STRUCTURE FOR ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE MILLION. NOT A WORKFORCE TRAINING COMPONENT FOR A. HUNDRED AND TEN MILLION FOR SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA- WE ALSO HAVE UP FORTY NOT. THE DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES TO HELP WITH THE STATE'S CAPACITY ISSUE COMMERCIAL DRIVER'S LICENSES ANOTHER COMPONENT WE HAVE AS THIRTY MILLION FOR THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT RELATED TO OPERATIONAL AND PROCESS IMPROVEMENTS SO THAT COMPRISES TWO POINT THREE BILLION THAT. OKAY BUT IT IN THE LIST THERE IS THERE'S NOTHING FOR DEVELOPING LAND NEAR THE PORTS TO RELIEVE THE CONGESTION FROM. AND ACCESS INTO CONTAINERS WHICH WAS I THINK WHAT WE DISCUSSED- IN COMMITTEE THAT THE GOVERNOR AND HIS ADMINISTRATION WOULD DECIDE BY DECEMBER FIFTEENTH THAT THERE WOULD BE SOME PATH THERE. I DON'T HAVE ANY SPECIFICS ON AND STATE ACCESS LAND BUT I'LL TAKE THAT QUESTION- BACK FOR SURE. BUT I DON'T HAVE ANY SPECIFIC OTHER THAN YOU KNOW THE ONE POINT TWO BILLION THAT I REFERENCED AT THE TOP OF IT. COULD BE YOURS FOR. RIGHT A PORTRAIT OF POLITICS INCLUDING RAILYARD EXPANSIONS A NEW BRIDGES AND OTHER ZERO EMISSION MODERNIZATION PROJECTS BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT SPECIFICALLY THAT THE STATE. LANDS REYES OKAY. THANK YOU- AND JUMPING ALMOST AS I KNOW WORSHIP SHORT TIMES I WANT TO BE SENSITIVE THAT LEADING MEMBERS AS QUESTIONS IT HAS THE GOVERNOR OUTLINED ANY MORE SPECIFICS ON ON REFORMING CONSERVATORSHIP. IT IS THERE. IS THERE MORE SPECIFICS THERE. SO THEY GOT. HAS DEFINITELY- BEEN PUBLIC ABOUT HIS INTEREST IN DOING SOMETHING LIKE CONSERVATIVE SHIP WE DO NOT HAVE A PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME. WHEN WE DO HAVE A PROPOSAL WE WILL BRING IT UP BEFORE THIS GROUP FOR SESSION OKAY AND HAVE HAVE YOU BROKEN OUT THE NUMBERS WHERE WE KNOW HOW MUCH IS BEING ALLOCATED FOR SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT AND MENTAL HEALTH. TREATMENT IS THAT BROKEN OUT SOMEWHERE- I'LL TURN THAT QUESTION TO MY COLLEAGUE ADAM DORSEY TO SEE IF WE HAVE THAT DETAIL AND WE DON'T WE CAN GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT. EDITOR'S THE FINANCE SIDE- I DON'T KNOW IF- THIS METRIC IS HAS THAT NUMBER HANDY IF NOT WE'LL WE'LL- CIRCLE BACK WITH YOUR STAFF. GREAT IF YOU GET THAT MAN I JUST TWO MORE QUESTIONS- IN TERMS OF- A CO OF IT I KNOW YOU JUST ANNOUNCED IT YET OR THESE. ARE ASKING FOR BILLION DOLLARS EXTRA- IS THERE CAPACITY THERE I KNOW THAT WOULD LEADING INTO THE BEGINNING OF THE SCHOOL YEAR- THEY WERE CHALLENGES WITH- THE WITH THE GETTING THE TESTING ARE THE KIDS TO THE SCHOOLS AND THEN OF COURSE WE HAD CHALLENGES WITH THE WITH THE FOURTH SURGE. ABOUT TESTING FACILITIES AND ITS ABILITY TO KIND OF ABSORB- HIGHER THROUGHPUT- IS THAT WHY THE AMOUNT IS GOING UP AT THE BILLION DOLLARS OR CAN YOU KIND OF SHED SOME LIGHT ON ON WHY IT WENT FROM ONE POINT FOUR TO TWO POINT FOUR BILLION. SURE I CAN GIVE YOU- AN OVERALL SENSE AND THEN I'M A ME THAT CALLING FOR JUSTIN DETAILS BUT GENERALLY SPEAKING WHEN WE PUT THIS BUDGET TOGETHER- THAT. PRIOR TO JANUARY MIDST OF OR CRIME AND SO WE REALLY WHAT YOU'RE SEEING IT'S US TRYING TO BE VERY RESPONSIVE TO THE MEDICAL HOSPITAL SURGEON THE ADDITIONAL EXPANSION OF TESTING- AS WELL AS- OUR OUR PUSH FOR MORE VACCINES SO THAT'S THE- THE REAL YOU KNOW. INCREASE YOUR SEEING IS LARGELY TESTING- FOR DTH ARM AS WELL AS SOME- ADDITIONAL BUT FUNDING FLEXIBILITY BECAUSE AS WE'VE LEARNED THIS IS AN EVOLVING PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS AND ATTEMPTING TO. HAVE IT- A QUICKLY IS REALLY IMPORTANT SO THAT'S THAT THE DIFFERENCE THAT YOU'RE SEEING- IT'S ABOUT NINE HUNDRED MILLION ADDITIONAL ON TOP OF THE- STOKER AND MY LAST QUESTION AND IT WILL BE- IN REGARDS TO YOU- PAID SICK LEAVE AND I KNOW WE'RE GONNA HAVE A HEARING ON THAT- COMING FORWARD AS WE GET MORE SPECIFICS BUT HAS THERE BEEN AN ANALYSIS DONE ON SB NINETY FIVE. I MEAN PRE EXTENSION AS WE DEBATE THE EXTENSION- IT'S IMPACT ON SMALL BUSINESSES THE IMPACT ON LABOR MARKET I MEAN HAS THERE BEEN A NOW SYSTEM WHERE YOU TO PROVIDE US- THE COST TO SMALL BUSINESSES IN. AND WHAT HAS HAPPENED SINCE IT'S- IS IMPLEMENTATION. I'M I'M NOT SURE THERE'S BEEN ANALYSIS DONE ON ON THE QUESTIONS THAT YOU ASK I THINK. YOU KNOW UNDERSTANDING THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING- THE ABILITY FOR WORKERS TO TAKE PAID SICK LEAVE AS- IS EVIDENT- I DON'T KNOW THAT THERE'S BEEN AN ANALYSIS ON THE POTENTIAL COST TO BUSINESS- IT. IN TERMS OF WEIGHING THE BENEFITS OF NOT HAVING TO. COME TO WORK VERSUS THE OUTPUT OF THE WORKERS AT WORK SO I'LL TURN THAT TO CHRIS CLICK TO SEE IF. HE HAD ANY SPECIFIC ADDITIONS. CHRIS COOK WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE NO IT JUST AGAIN AS- MISLI STATED NO ADDITIONAL ANALYSIS- ECONOMIC- DATA IS AVAILABLE ON THAT. THAT WERE AWARE. OKAY THE AND THE REASON WHY I ASK IS THAT I THINK WHEN WE ORIGINALLY DISCUSSED THE- DISCUSS SB NINETY FIVE I THINK THERE WAS A FEDERAL TAX CREDIT- IN PLACE AND I THINK THAT HAS EXPIRED. AND SO I'M I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND- WHAT THE COST WOULD BE- TO- TO SMALL BUSINESSES INTO THE BUSINESS- COMMITTEE IN GENERAL- AS WE EVALUATE. AS EXTENSION SO- IF YOU COULD PROVIDE US ANY ANALYSIS I THINK THAT WOULD BE EXTREMELY HELPFUL AND I THINK THAT YOUR FIRST PATIENTS. THIRTY WITH BRUSHED YOUR WE'RE GONNA GO TO MR MATHESON AND MR SMITH. THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR- I WANT TO GO BACK TO THE DROUGHT FUNDING QUICKLY WANT TO MAKE SURE I HEARD THE PARMA FINANCE CORRECTLY THAT THERE'S ZERO MONEY FOR NEW STORAGE. YES ALTERNATE AGAIN BACK TO CRYSTALS HERE TO. YES THAT'S CORRECT THERE'S NO FUNDING SPECIFICALLY FOR WATER STORAGE IN THE BUDGET OKAY SO IS THERE ANYTHING FOR ANY NEW WATER INTO THE STATE'S SYSTEM. IF I'M UNDERSTANDING YOUR QUESTION CORRECTLY- NOW ALTHOUGH THE FUNDING THAT'S INCLUDED IN THE DROUGHT PACKAGE THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION- ARE VERY S. WATER CONSERVATION- AT PROJECTS AS THAT'S THE THING ABOUT GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT URBAN AND SMALL COMMUNITY DROUGHT RELIEF LEON REPURPOSE SCENE- INSULATING. PERFORMERS SO THERE'S NOT ANY THE BIGGEST PROBLEM WE HAVE GOING INTO ANOTHER DROUGHT IS THAT. THE FUNCTION IN MY AREA IN THE SILICON VALLEY DON'T HAVE WATER THEY'RE HAVING TO CUT DEALS WITH WITH OTHER AREAS TO MOVE WATER TO DO THESE DIFFERENT THINGS. AND WITHOUT ANY NEW WATER INTO THE SYSTEM. THE CITIES ARE GONNA GO DRY THIS IS A JUST- IN AG ISSUE THIS IS THE FACT THAT WE HAVE. DISADVANTAGE HI IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES THAT AGAIN DO NOT HAVE ACCESS. TO CLEAN RELIABLE WATER. SO I WOULD ENCOURAGE THAT THAT WE DO GET SOMETHING IN THERE FOR MORE WATER INTO THE SYSTEM- BECAUSE FRANKLY OUR PEOPLE CAN'T DRINK DOLLARS SO IT'S NICE TO SAY WE'RE GOING TO PUT. MONEY IN INTO THE BUDGET FOR DROUGHT BUT IF THAT MONEY DOESN'T COME WITH WATER. IT IT DOESN'T HELP SO WE NEED TO WORK ON THAT THANK YOU. IT IF I COULD JUST CLARIFY TEO- SO THERE THERE IS IN TERMS OF. ADDING KIND OF WATER AS STORAGE A MOTHER ISN'T SPECIFICALLY FUNDING FOR ABOVE GROUND WATER STORAGE- BEYOND THAT THE EXISTING PROPOSITION ONE FUNDING THERE IS FUNDING- FOR AT SUSTAINABLE GROUNDWATER MANAGEMENT SO UNDERGROUND WATER STORAGE- WHICH WHICH HAS. CONSIDERABLY MORE CAPACITY THAN WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ABOVE GROUND STORAGE SO- IN TERMS OF THAT COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH AND CONJUNCTIVE USE WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT- THE ADMINISTRATION CONTINUES TO SUPPORT AS A MORE. SUSTAINABLE LONG TERM APPROACH TO WATER AVAILABILITY- THERE IS THERE IS FUNDING- FOR GROUNDWATER. STORAGE CORRECT BUT YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE WATER. TO GET. IN AND YOU HAVE TO MOVE IT DOWN THE CONVEYANCE SYSTEM AND THEN PUT IT INTO THE GROUND WITHOUT ANY MORE WATER. TO MOVE YOU STILL HAVE NOTHING. OKAY ARE WE GONNA MISS SMITH IN THE MISTER DAHLE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MY QUESTION'S GOING TO BE IN REGARDS TO INFRASTRUCTURE. ROLE DISTRICTS LIKE MINDED THROUGHOUT pTHE STATE WE TALK ABOUT INFRASTRUCTURE AND I THINK YOU MENTIONED SOME FUNDING THERE.% PUT UP MY DISTRICT IS HAVING A HARD TIME GETTING MONEY FROM THE HIGHWAY BRIDGE PROGRAM. AND HOW MUCH IS IN THE BUDGET THAT PROJECTED FOR PROJECTS THAT ALREADY BEEN APPROVED HAVE A PARTICULAR PROJECT THE BRIDGE IS RATED THE NUMBER TWO SO IT'S READY TO FALL DOWN. OUT OF THE SKELETON. ALWAYS READY FOR CONSTRUCTION AND NOW THEY GOT CALLED LAST TUESDAY AND SAID THERE'S NO FUNDING IN THE HIGHWAY BRIDGE FUNDING. SO I'D LIKE TO FIND OUT WHERE THAT FUNDING MIGHT BE OR FOR HOW THE PROJECT GOES. AND I'M NOT SURE IF ERICA WILL ANSWER THAT. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER- SMITH I'M GOING TO TURN THAT OVER TO YOU TO RESET CALVERT FOR SOME INFORMATION NEXT HOUSE UP. ASSEMBLY MEMBER I DO NOT HAVE THAT LEVEL OF INFORMATION SO AND WILL REACH OUT TO YOUR OFFICE STAFF TO GET A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL AND THEN WORK WITH. CALTRANS TO SEE WHAT WE'RE ABLE TO PROVIDE AS A FOLLOW UP BUT DON'T HAVE THAT ON HAND HERE- THINKING WILL PROBABLY BE A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL TO BE ABLE TO TRACK THAT DOWN OKAY. NOW YOU CAN REACH OUT TO MY OFFICE WE GONNA REACH OUT TO YOU WE GOTTA GET MAKE SURE WE GET TOGETHER BECAUSE THIS PROJECT IS FOR VERY CRITICAL FOR MY DISTRICT. WE WILL. YEAH WE WILL DEFINITELY REACH OUT TO YOUR OFFICE. SO FIRST STREET BRIDGE IN BARSTOW. SO THAT'LL GIVE YOU SOME IDEA FOR THAT. OKAY THEN- IN REGARDS TO EDUCATION HOW DOES THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED ALTERNATIVE SCHOOL EIGHTY A CALCULATION AFFECT CHARTER SCHOOLS. BECAUSE I KNOW CHARTER SCHOOLS HAVE BEEN GETTING A LOT OF EXPANSION BUT THERE'S NO FUNDING ISSUES BEFORE CHARTER SCHOOLS. I MISS MISS LEE DID YOU HEAR THAT. ALL RIGHT ALL RIGHT I WAS ON MUTE. INTERNET OVER TO CHRIS FERGUSON FOR MAKING. MEMBER OUT CHRIS FERGUSON AT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL DOES NOT DIRECTLY ADDRESS- CHARTER SCHOOL DECLINING ENROLLMENT A WHAT WE HAVE SIGNALED IN OUR BUDGET SUMMARY IS THAT WE ARE WORKING WITH- CHARTER SCHOOLS AND REPRESENTATIVES. TO UP FORMULATE A POTENTIAL- THE POTENTIAL OF THE SOLUTION TO ADDRESSING DECLINING ENROLLMENT AT CHARTER SCHOOLS COME TO MAKE PROVISION. YES THAT'S DECLINING AND IN CHARTER SCHOOLS EXPANSION. IN THE GROUP OF THE CALCULATION I GOT PARTICULAR TO CHARTER SCHOOLS. THAT THEY'VE HAD OVER TWO HUNDRED STUDENTS IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS AND THEY NEED TO GET THE FUNDING TO CARRY ON NOT GO BACK TWO YEARS. WITHIN THE NINETEEN PRE PANDEMIC THEY NEED TO BE THE FUNDING RIGHT NOW BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE LEAVING THE- SURGICAL DRESSING SHUT DOWN CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE OPEN REAL COMMUNITIES ARE OPEN. HOW ARE THEY GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY GET THE FUNDING FOR THESE CHILDREN. SURE OF MOVING FORWARD FROM TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. INTO TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE AND ONGOING- THE CHARTER SCHOOLS WOULD BE FUNDED AT CURRENT YEAR- AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE SO THAT THOSE THAT ARE GROWING ARE BEING FUNDED. YOU DON'T HAVE A PROPOSAL IN THIS BUDGET IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE TO CHANGE THAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OKAY THANK THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I'LL BE BRIEF BECAUSE I KNOW WE'RE GOING TO DISCUSS A LOT OF THE CENTER SUBCOMMITTEES BUT AS THAT YOU'RE BROUGHT UP IN THE BLUEPRINT WHICH I KNOW HE HAD A STRONG HAND AND THERE WAS- THE ASSEMBLY BLUEPRINT BLUEPRINT HAD A TEN BILLION FOR SCHOOL FACILITIES AND THAT'S A GREAT WAY. TO INVEST IN INFRASTRUCTURE BECAUSE OUR SCHOOL FACILITY PROGRAM IS ESSENTIALLY OUT OF MONEY- SO THAT THAT THAT THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED IN AGAIN USING SOME OF THOSE- ONE TIME MONIES TO ADDRESS OUR INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS ACROSS THE STATE IN OUR SCHOOLS WOULD BE A VERY VALUABLE THING INVESTMENT IN OUR FUTURE- AND I THINK THIS IS. THIS IS SOMEWHAT LINKED TO- TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM US VERY- COMMENTS- ALL ARTICULATED OVER MANNER AND THAT IS THAT THE BASE NEEDS TO BE MUCH HIGHER THE BASE ALLOCATION LIMIT THE GOVERNOR HAS FILE- HE'S PROPOSED A FIVE POINT 33% DJUSTMENT THAT'S UPWARD TO THE BASE ALLOCATION IT NEEDS TO BE PROBABLY DOUBLE PLUS THAT QUITE FRANKLY. DUE TO INFLATION DUE TO DECLINING ENROLLMENT AND DUE TO STUDENT NEEDS AND ALSO THIS IS NOT A YEAR TO BE CREATING A LOT OF NEW PROGRAMS. SCHOOLS NEED TO BE OPEN THEIR STRESS TEACHERS ARE STRESSING MINISTRY DISTRESS STUDENT SUCCESS- IT'S NOT A YEAR WHERE WE NEED TO DESIGN A BUNCH OF PROGRAMS AT SCHOOLS YOU KNOW SHOULD IMPLEMENT- BECAUSE AGAIN AND RIGHT NOW WE'RE KINDA WE'RE STICKING TO THE BASICS SO WITH THAT- YOU HEARD ME IT'S REALLY ABOUT ADDING TO THE BASE SO THE SCHOOLS CAN STAY AFLOAT. IN THE OUT YEARS AS WELL THANK YOU. DID YOU WANT TO COMMENT TO YOU JUST TO MAKE A STEP. IT WAS MY EDITORIAL STRUCTURE OKAY THANK YOU MR. WE'RE GONNA GO WITH MR COOPER DR RAINBOW WITH THE DOCTOR. THANK YOU MISTER CHURCH TO FOLLOW UP ON MISTER FALLS QUESTION EARLIER SEWER. THREE BILLION TOWARDS YOU I THIS YEAR TWO BILLION NEXT YEAR. SO WHAT STATE SEN WHAT STEPS ITS STATE TAKING RECOVER THE CASH AND ASSETS ATTAINED. WITH FRAUDULENT EDIE CLAIMS. CHRIS COOK. THANKS CHRIS COOK WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO- AS AS USUAL WITH ANY OVERPAYMENTS THAT- THAT THE DEPARTMENT EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT. IS ONCE THOSE OVERPAYMENTS ARE IDENTIFIED THEY'RE MAKING- BEST CONSERVATIVE EFFORTS TO RECOVER THOSE FUNDS SO AS TO THE SPECIFICS I DON'T KNOW- WHAT WAS AREBUT I KNOW THAT THEY ARE ONCE THEY ARE IDENTIFIED THEY ARE MAKING EFFORTS TO RECOVER THOSE OVERPAYMENTS SO WE'RE ACTUALLY NOT TALKING OVER PAYMENTS WERE TALKING ACTUAL THEFT SO I MEAN SOME FOLKS OVERPAID BUT- I'M- DOING DOWN ON THE ON THE FIFTH PIECE. YES TO OVERPAYMENTS WOULD INCLUDE THAT WOULD INCLUDE FRAUD- OR- IF FRAUDULENT- PAYMENTS AS WELL BUT- ET DE IS MAKING THEIR BEST CONCERTED EFFORTS TO RECOVER THOSE FUNDS FOR FUN AS WELL YES. IF ANYTHING THE LEGISLATURE CAN DO TO HELP OUR CYSTIDIA RECOVERING THESE FUNDS. YES SO INCLUDED IN THE BUDGET THEREARE SEVERAL- I REQUEST FOR CONTRACT FUNDS- TO ASSIST EDT IN THESE EFFORTS AND- NOT ONLY- FOR FRAUD- BUT NOT PREVENTING FUTURE FRAUD. SO THERE IS SOME PROPOSALS IN THE BUDGET THAT WOULD HELP EDT TO ASK FURTHER ACCOMPLISH THEIR GOALS OF THOSE OVERPAYMENTS. THANK YOU I REQUEST NOT CANNABIS NOW FOR THE A SIX MILLION PROPOSED FOR CONSUMERS CONSUMER AWARENESS CAMPAIGN. CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT THAT INCLUDES. YES I'VE BEEN TRYING TO ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES FOR THAT RESPONSE. HI THIS IS CAN BE HARVESTED FROM DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. AND THE CONSUMER AWARENESS CAMPAIGN WOULD BE SIX POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS- IT'S ON THE MULTI YEAR CONSUMER EDUCATION AND AWARENESS CAMPAIGNS. I KEEP TELLING OF THE FRAMEWORK IS CONSUMER SAFETY AND AWARENESS OF WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE KNOW. THAT THE PRODUCT THEY'RE BUYING IS SAFE WHETHER THEY'RE CALIFORNIA RESIDENT OR A VISITOR FROM OUT OF STATE. PHOTO BY BATTERY LEGAL WEED THEN IS THAT WHAT IT IS. THAT'S PART OF IT CORRECT. SO I GUESS THE HARD PART IS IT'S TOUGH BECAUSE I MEAN PEOPLE ARE BUYING THE BLACK MARKETS DRIVING BECAUSE IT'S CHEAPER THERE AND OBVIOUSLY IT'S UNREGULATED SO I DON'T KNOW. IF IT'S SHOWING HOW THEY'RE GONNA BE NO SPLIT THAT IT'S REALLY TOUGH I MEAN IT'S- GOOD LUCK ON THAT- OKAY. THAT NUMBER QUESTION ON THE ON THE ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT ISSUE- FOR THE- TWENTY MILLION TO SUPPORT SMALL BUSINESS. SO IT WHEN YOU LOOK AT SMALL BUSINESS WITH THE MOST THE SMSH AND GRABS. IT INVOLVED- HIGH END RETAILERS OR LARGE BIG BOX RETAILERS. HOW THIS TWENTY MILLION- HOW CAN BE SURE THAT IT GETS DOWN TO ACTUAL SMALL BUSINESSES. IN IN THIS NAME IS A SMALL BUSINESSES SO. HOW REASSURED SMALL BUSINESSES THE MONEY AND NOT CORPORATIONS. YEAH THE DETAILS ABOUT GRANTS ARE BEING WORKED OUT BUT I WILL TURN IT OVER TO MELBOURNE TO SEE IF HE HAS ANYTHING ELSE TO ADD. HI GOOD ATERNOON AND WEBER KARMA FINDS. AND THEY'RE CONSIDERED TO BE WORKED OUT THE DETAILS I DON'T THINK ALWAYS TRYING TO WORK IN DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS AND SPEAKING OF RETAILERS. WELL THE BEST WAY TO. MANAGE THE PROGRAM. AND I THINK THAT ONE POSSIBILITY SPOKE ABOUT IS HAVING A VETERAN ON THE BUSINESS SO THE SMALL BUSINESS GRANT PROGRAM HAD A CAPITALIST THIS BE WITH. WITH AT HEALTH ISSUE. OKAY NOT ONE APPLY THE GOVERNOR FOR THE FOR THE NINETY FIVE MILLION FOR A MONEY GOING TO LOCAL GRANTS AND LOCAL OFFICES. AND YOU KNOW CHP I IN A GOOD JOB. AND I THINK. YOU KNOW WHAT THE BIG ISSUES IS THAT- THE STATE HAS FIVE TASK FORCES RIGHT NOW THEY'RE SET UP IN THE NINETIES. TO DO WITH IDENTITY THEFT RETAIL CREDIT FRAUD. AND THE THINGS THAT THE- ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT REALLY DRILL DOWN INTO. SO YOU HAVE THESE TASK FORCES HAVE BEEN IN EFFECT FOR TWENTY YEARS. AND THEY ARE REALLY GETTING THAT MUCH THE IN THERE PERFECTLY THE PERMITTED BILL WITH THIS OBVIOUSLY BEEN DOING IT FOR A LONG TIME. IF THE EXPERIENCE BUT- THE ISSUE IS GETTING THE MONEY DOWN TO THEM. IN A SPEECH PLEASE BEEN DOING A GREAT JOB AT SEIZE P. IS NOT A THOUSAND POSITION STATEWIDE. WE TOOK HER POSITIONS HERE TO MAKE TRAFFICKER THE CAPITAL. THERE DOWN NINE HUNDRED ALREADY. IN PREVIOUS YEARS ARE NOW SIX CENTERS WITH EACH B. CONTINUES TO- LOSE POSITIONS. IN THE MEANTIME WE ARE COUNTIES ARE SCREAMING BECAUSE THERE'S NO TRAFFIC ENFORCEMENT. IN THE UNINCORPORATED AREAS- SO. SO HOW DO WE DEAL WITH THAT IN. YOU KNOW HOW WE MAKE SURE THAT THE MONEY GETS TO THE RIGHT FOLKS THAT THAT REALLY HAVE THE EXPERTISE IN THIS. YEAH I THINK THE STATE IS GOING TO TAKE A- A COLLABORATIVE ROLE WITH LOCALS. IN REGARDS TO THAT AND I DON'T KNOW IF- THERE'S MORE DETAIL THAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR BUT AT THAT POINT THAT'S- I'LL ALSO BEING. WORKED OUT THE ADDITIONAL FUNDS IS FOR. THE EXPANSION OF THIS TASK TWELVE AND THE H. P. OUR SUPPORT. IN JUST LET MY LAST QUESTION- IS THERE ANY FUNDING RIGHT NOW FOR THE I KEPT US FORCES IN THE PROPOSED BUDGET- I ALTERNATE QUESTION TO- ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES. AND IF WE DON'T HAVE A RESPONSE I CAN GET BACK TO YOU YOU- MISTER COOPER OKAY. OF THE PROJECT. DR MARK THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FROM HI I WILL BEGIN WITH SOME FRAMING COMMENTS AND SAVE MY QUESTIONS FOR THE SUBCOMMITTEE PROCESS BUT I WANTED TO BEGIN WITH AN APPRECIATION FOR THE GOVERNOR FOR HIS LEADERSHIP DURING THIS PANDEMIC OF THE CENTURY WE HAVE BEEN WEATHERING THIS STORM TOGETHER WHETHER OR NOT WE ALL CAME FROM THE SAME SHIPS ORIGINALLY WE ARE ALL NOW ON THIS BOAT CALLED CALIFORNIA. AND I'M GRATEFUL FOR THE GOVERNOR AND THE VISION THAT HE'S HAD FOR A STATE HIS ABILITY TO FOLLOW SCIENCE AND PROVIDE A DIRECTION FOR OUR STATE IS REFLECTED WITH IN THIS BUDGET AND WANTED TO SPEAK ABOUT THE VALUES THAT ARE REFLECTED IN THE BUDGET PROPOSED ON JANUARY TENTH. BUT THIS PROJECT WILL CONTINUE THE LEGACY THAT CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN LEADING TO PROVIDE HEALTH CARE ACCESS TO ALL WHO CALLED THE STATE HOME AND ARE INCOME ELIGIBLE REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRATION STATUS AND WE HAVE THE HARD WORK OF IMPLEMENTING THIS POLICY OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS AND THEN ROLLING HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS WHO HAVE BEEN CALLED THE CENTRAL AND NEED TO HAVE THEIR ESSENTIAL NEEDS TAKEN CARE OF COURT TO THAT. BEING HEALTHCARE. BUT AS WE CONTINUE TO ADVANCE AND IMPROVE AND ENROLL PEOPLE INTO MEDIC HAL WE MUST ENSURE THAT WE ARE PROVIDING A GOOD QUALITY AS WELL. AND THAT'S WHY I'M EXCITED TO WORK WITH THIS ADMINISTRATION ON THE CAL AIM PROPOSAL THAT IS BOTH TRANSFORMATIVE AND FOUNDATIONAL TO CHANGING THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEMS AND- CARE THAT WE PROVIDE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. THE CHANGES THAT WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT TO IMPROVE BOTH HEALTH CARE ACCESS IN THE SYSTEMS OF CARE DELIVERY ALSO LEAD US TOWARDS CONVERSATION AND ENSURING THAT WE PROVIDE AFFORDABILITY WITHIN HEALTHCARE. AND BELIEVE THAT IT'S IMPORTANT FOR OUR SUB COMMITTEE TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE OFFICE OF HEALTHCARE PORTABILITY AND ENSURE THAT WE ARE PUTTING QUALITY METRICS IN PLACE. AS WE ARE HAVING CONVERSATIONS ABOUT COST WE CANNOT LOSE. SIGHT OF THE FACT THAT IT IS PEOPLE WHO ARE WE ARE CARING FOR AND MUST ESTABLISH. METRICS THAT WE CAN BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE TO. WE ALL KNOW THAT THAT WHICH IS NOT MEASURED CANNOT BE IMPROVED AND WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE CONTROLLING COSTS THAT WE ARE SIMILARLY LOOKING T THE QUALITY TO MAKE IMPROVEMENTS THERE AS WELL. BUT I'D LIKE TO FOCUS ON THE METRIC SAYS I BELIEVE THAT IS A KEY PART THAT MY OFFICE WILL WORK ON FOR THE ORDERS THAT ARE IN STATUTES NOW BOTH IN CHILD WELFARE SERVICES. AND THEN CAL WORKS OR IS AN ACRONYM FOR THE OUTCOME AND ACCOUNTABILITY REVIEW. AND IT'S A PROCESS TO HELP TO IMPROVE STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT AND TO ESTABLISH METRICS THAT WE CAN LATER BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE TO. I INTEND FOR US AS THE LEGISLATURE TO DO ITS DUE DILIGENCE AND OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY. AS WE IMPLEMENT MANY OF THE GREAT PROPOSALS TO ENSURE THAT WE ULTIMATELY GET A GOOD RETURN ON INVESTMENT IN TAXPAYER DOLLARS. OUR RESPONSIBILITY AS AN INSTITUTION IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE PROVIDE THAT NECESSARY OVERSIGHT AND I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT WORK AS THE CHAIR OF SOMEONE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU DR WORKED AND THEY WERE GOING TO GO TO MR BENNETT AND MR MCCARTY. YEAH AND IT'S JUST JUST A JUST A SIMPLE QUESTION AND- WHEN WILL WE EIGHT OF WHEN CAN WE EXPECT TO SEE THE LANGUAGE ON THE COVE IT PAID LEAVE. PROPOSAL I'M SURPRISED WE'RE GETTING OUT A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF PHONE CALLS IN OUR OFFICE ABOUT ABOUT THAT AND WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO ANSWER CONSTITUENTS SO WHEN CAN WE EXPECT THAT LANGUAGE. YES MISTER WHERE WE CONTINUE TO WORK THROUGH THAT AND- I BELIEVE WE WILL HAVE THAT LANGUAGE- SOON I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE THE DATE BUT I'M I'LL TURN THAT QUESTION TO. CHRIS COOK FOR SOME DETAILS THE ADMINISTRATION IS CONTINUING TO REFINE THAT LANGUAGE AND WILL WE SHOULD BE- SHARING THAT WITH THE LEGISLATURE IN THE COMING DAYS. THANK YOU. I THINK YOU'RE GONNA GO TO MISTER BENNETT THE MISTER MCCARTY THE MISTER ABBAS YOU VERY MUCH MR- MY A FIRST QUESTION DEALS WITH THE NINE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS- THAT DOES IN THE BUDGET FOR- THOUSAND ZERO MISSION SHORT HAUL TRUCKS IN SEVENTEEN HUNDRED EUROVISION TRANSIT BUSES. AND I APPRECIATE A QUESTION IT WAS EARLIER IN TERMS OF LOCATION BUT IT IS THERE ANY PLANNING AT THIS POINT TIME ON THE PART OF THE ADMINISTRATION OUR THOUGHTS IN TERMS OF HOW YOU LOGICALLY LOCATE THESE- SO THEY MAKE SENSE- I THINK SOME INFRASTRUCTURE PARTICULAR TALK ABOUT COMMERCIAL VEHICLES AND WHEN WE GO TO THE HEAVIER DUTY COMMERCIAL VEHICLES. IT MAY MAKE A LOT OF SENSE TO HAVE THE SINKS LOCATED IN A WAY THAT THERE IS A CUSTOM CONFIDENCE THAT YOU KNOW YOU WILL BE ABLE TO IF YOU MAKE THE INVESTMENT IN THE VEHICLE THAT ON THE ROUTE THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE GOING THERE WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO REFUELING STATIONS. A COULD ANYBODY HELP ME WITH THAT PLACE. SURE I'LL JUST START WITH- SORT OF A BROAD OVERVIEW AND THEN TURN IT OVER TO SERGIO AGUILAR BUT THE INVESTMENTS ARE BOTH FOR YOUR CALLS AND TRUCK REPLACEMENT AS WELL AS CHARGING STATIONS THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I BELIEVE WE'RE THINKING- IS STATEWIDE BUT IT THAT'S IT AS REGARDS TO REGION'S I WILL TURN IT OVER TO SERGIO AGUILAR. THANK YOU. YET EVEN THOUGH THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT IS- YOU KNOW THE WHAT OF THE BIG FACTORS WITHIN OUR ENTIRE THAT PROPOSAL IS LOOKING AT EQUITY IN LOOKING AT THOSE AREAS THAT ARE MOST HABITAT BANDAGE AND HAVE THE- AIR QUALITY AIR POLLUTION IMPACT. SO THAT IT KIND OF ONE OF THE KEYBOARD THE FRAMEWORK THAT HELPS DETERMINE- SOME OF THAT- BUT WE- THE AIRPORT AND ALTHOUGH THE ENERGY COMMISSION THAT IS PART OF THAT THE FUNDING BUT- WITH THE ACTUAL VEHICLE BE AIRPORT BOTH REPUBLIC PROFIT I THINK WE EVERY YEAR- TAX TREATMENT SOME OF THE CRITERIA. OF THE GUIDELINES AND SO THAT THAT ALLOWS- BROUGHT IN BY. THE COMMUNITY YEAH I'LL BEAT HELP ON THE CRITERIA AND ALL THAT- HOLDEN WE AWARDED AND IF YOU'RE GEOGRAPHICALLY THOUGH I DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER AT THE BIG DETAILS ON OUR GEOGRAPHY BUT- THEY DO HAVE A PRETTY OPEN PUBLIC. PROCESS THAT THEY GO THROUGH THE BOARD OPTED OUT RIGHT HERE PART OF THE PROGRAM. I APPRECIATE THAT AND OVERALL I BUT I CERTAINLY DO WANT TO COMPLEMENT THE GOVERNOR'S TEAM- THE COMMITMENT TO TRY TO CONTINUE TO MOVE THE NEEDLE ON CLIMATE CHANGES IS VERY SIGNIFICANT AND EVIDENT HERE. I WOULD POINT OUT- I ONLY RAISED THE QUESTION OF- I'D THE COMMITMENT TO DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES- FROM AN EQUITY STANDPOINT IS VERY IMPORTANT TERMS OF LOCATION OF APPROVING AIR QUALITY. BUT TO IMPROVE AIR QUALITY WE HAVE TO HAVE PEOPLE MAKE THE INVESTMENTS IN THE VEHICLES I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THOSE PEOPLE MAKE THE INVESTMENTS OF THE VEHICLES FEEL CONFIDENT THAT. WHEREVER THEY THAT THEY THAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY. ECONOMICALLY OPERATE THE VEHICLE BECAUSE THEY KNOW THEY'LL BE A FUELING STATION EVEN IF THAT'S MAY HAVE TO BE LOCATED OUTSIDE OF A DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY. MY SECOND QUESTION- REALLY APPRECIATE THE- COMMITMENT OF A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS- FOR THE PRODUCTION OF GREEN HYDROGEN- TO USE ELECTRICITY SPLIT WATER DOCTOR CHEN. AND MY- MY- QUESTION IS THAT. WE HAVE A CAL WHERE TO ENOUGH SOLAR FOR OUR AND WINTER TIME MEANS HAVE X. SOLAR ENERGY IN THE SUMMERTIME- BECAUSE OF THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT- THE SUN IS SHINING AND THE ANGLE THAT IS THERE HAS THERE BEEN ANY THOUGHT GIVEN TO FINDINGWAYS TO INCENTIVIZE IN PARTICULAR THE EXCESS SOLAR ENERGY THAT WE HAVE IN THE SUMMERTIME- AND USING THAT TO PRODUCE THE SCREEN HYDROGEN. YES QUESTION APPROACH TO BASIC HEALTHCARE. OUR WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I DON'T KNOW BUT WE WILL TAKE THAT THAT COMMENT BACK BUT- I DON'T KNOW THAT WE HAVE A SPECIFIC- OF LINKAGE TO THAT TO THAT SUMMER USAGE TO THE GREEN HYDROGEN PROPOSAL THAT WE WILL TAKE THAT COMING BACK THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I HAVE JUST A COUPLE COUPLE OF JUST VERY QUICK POINTS NUMBER ONE I APPRECIATE THE FUNDING- THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR WORKERS TO SUBSIDIZE OUR LEARNING AND JOB TRAINING AS WE MAKE THIS SWITCH IS ONE THAT WE'RE ALL AWARE OF AND I JUST WANTED TO- EQUITY IT MIGHT MY APPRECIATION FOR THAT BEING RECOGNIZED IN THE BUDGET- YOU WE ALSO HAVE IN THE BUDGET A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO DEVELOP GREEN- GREEN. ENERGY OF RIVER RIGHT IF SOURCES AND I JUST WANT TO COMPLIMENT THE GOVERNOR AND HIS STAFF. UP FOR. THE INNOVATIVE ASPECT OF THAT WHICH IS THAT IF THE COMPANY BECOMES PROFITABLE CALIFORNIA GETS A SHARE OF THE PROFITS- I THINK THAT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT MAKES A TAXPAYERS FEEL BETTER- AND SOMETHING THAT. I THINK WE SHOULD TRY TO APPLY AS OFTEN AS WE CAN AS WE MOVE FORWARD. AND THE FINAL QUESTION COLLEAGUES ASKING YOU. SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT WATER NEW WATER SOURCES X. SENTARA- IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT IN THE BUDGET WATER RECYCLING COMMUNITIES THAT WANT TO START TO. RECYCLE MORE OF THEIR WATER INSTEAD OF SIMPLY DISCHARGING IT INTO THEIR INTO THE WASTE TREATMENT CENTER- THAT DOES RECYCLING PROJECTS WOULD BE- PART OF THE- OF FOR COULD BE FUNDED WITH THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET RIGHT NOW COULD SOMEBODY CONFIRM THAT BECAUSE THAT. CERTAINLY COULD BE VIEWED AS NEW WATER BECAUSE IT'S WATER THAT YOU KNEW WHAT WE WERE USING. AT ALTERNATE OVER TO CRYSTALS HERE TO. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THANK YOU- FOR THAT FOR THAT QUESTION WE CERTAINLY VIEW I WATER RECYCLING AND CONSERVATION A WATER CONSERVATION PROGRAMS EVEN MORE BROADLY- S. PROGRAMS THAT CONTRIBUTE GEO I'M A HIGHER FLAT SUPPLY OF WATER- TO YOUR SPECIFIC QUESTION ABOUT WATER RECYCLING AND YES THERE IS A SPECIFIC FUNDING ARE INCLUDED IN THE WATER RESILIENCE PACKAGE- FROM FROM LAST YEAR WHICH WAS A THREE YEAR PACKAGE- IT'S FUNDING FOR BOTH WATER RECYCLING AND GROUNDWATER CLEANUP- SPECIFICALLY AS IT RELATES TO BUDGET YOUR THERE'S A- HUNDRED MILLION AND THERE'S ALSO ANOTHER HUNDRED MILLION- NEXT YEAR FOR A TOTAL. FOUR HUNDRED MILLION A LOT OF RESPECT TO THE ADMINISTRATION MAY BENEFIT FROM BEING ABLE TO IDENTIFY THAT AS NEW WATER SOURCES FOR CALIFORNIA THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I THINK YOU'RE NOT GOING TO MISS MCCARTY THAN MISTER RAMOS SYNONYMOUS FIGHTERS. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AT FIRST TO MISTER BENNETT JUST TOOK ANOTHER ONE TO LET YOU KNOW THAT I'M GOING TO ASK YOU ABOUT GREEN HYDROGEN I'VE NO IDEA WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT BUT I'M SURE HE'LL EXPLAIN IT TO ME LET ME FASCINATING. BOB BUT BIG PICTURE I WANTED TO JUST TAG ONTO WHAT ARE CARE SAID AT THE OUTSET THIS IS A GREAT BUDGET- BUILDING FRANKLY OFF LAST YEAR'S WORK WE DID SOME AMAZING TRANSFORMATIONAL ACTIONS LAST YEAR ON PUBLIC EDUCATION EARLY AT HEALTHCARE- HIGHER READ OF COURSE MOST IMPORTANTLY MAKING THE BUDGET FISCALLY SOUND AND SAVING FOR THE RAINY DAY. SO WHILE THERE'S NOT A LOT OF NEW THINGS IN THIS BUDGET A LOT OF WHAT IT DOES IS FUNDS AND IMPLEMENT WHAT WE ARE FOCUSED ON LAST YEAR BUT JUST WANTED. TO FOCUS ON THE THREE HIGHER AT K. TWELVE AND EARLY AT ISSUES- WILL WILL BE IN SEPT TWO AND WE'LL GET TO IN GREATER DETAIL SO WANTED TO- THAT KNOWLEDGE AND THINK THE ADMINISTRATION FOR STARTING THE FUNDING FOR THE CHILD CARE EXPANSION AND UNIVERSAL T. K. WHICH WILL BE A BIG BOOM FOR OUR YOUNGEST LEARNERS AND ALSO WORKING FAMILIES BUT WE ARE HEARING FROM FROM POPLE WHO ARE IN THE WORK FORCE THAT. WE HAVE A CHALLENGE ON A PEOPLE TO WORK IN THESE PROFESSIONS- SEE MAKE SURE THAT WE FOCUS ON- FINISHING AND FINALIZING THE RATE REFORM TO MAKE SURE THAT WE PAY- THESE PROVIDERS ADEQUATE- REIMBURSE. TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE FINANCIALLY. AND PAY THEIR WORKERS A LIVING WAGES- WE ARE TIME AND TIME AGAIN ABOUT PEOPLE CAN LEAVE AND GO TO WORK. MAKE MORE MONEY- MAKING A PERFECT STARBUCKS LATTE BUT UPPING MAKE A PERFECT THREE AND FOUR YEAR OLDS WE TO FOCUSED ON OUR PRIORITIES- AS FAR AS OUR OUR K. TWELVE. SCHOOLS YOU KNOW OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND EDUCATORS ARE THE MVPS IN COVERAGE TRYING TO GETTING. OUR STUDENTS BACK. TO LEARNING AND HELPING FAMILIES GET BACK TO WORK- WE DO HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO WHEN IT COMES TO OUR TEACHER AN EDUCATOR SHORTAGE SO. I WOULD LIKE TO PROPOSALS FROM THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET I WILL BE FINE TUNING THEM A POTENTIALLY ADDING SOME MORE- IN THE- IN THE IN THE PROCESS- AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS THE PAST UNIVERSAL AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS- WE'RE- FULLY IN SUPPORT OF THAT- I THINK WE- NEED TO FINE TUNE- SOME OF THE DEFINITIONS TO MAKE SURE THEY CAN HELP ALL. FAMILIES IN CALIFORNIA HAVE. A FREE AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS AS WE PROMISED IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET- IN THAT HIGHER READ BRIEFLY I JUST WANT TO MENTION THAT- AS MR O'DONNELL SAID I FULLY SUPPORT LOOKING AT ONE TIME MONEY. FOR SCHOOL FACILITIES ALSO A PROPER USE OF ONE TIME MONEY IN THE HIGHER ED. IS AND HOUSING WHICH WE DID LAST YEAR FOR TWO BILLION. AND WE'VE WE'VE HAD SUCH A SURGE IN THE AMOUNT OF CAMPUS IS APPLYING FOR THIS MONEY. IT SHOWS THE- IT SHOWS THE- THE DEMAND. SO POTENTIALLY WE COULD PUT SOME MORE IN THE CURRENT YEAR. FOR HOUSING WHICH WOULD HELP- A CURRENT. STUDENTS ARE STRUGGLING TO PAY ITS MEAT FIND A PLACE TO LIVE- ALLOW CMPUS IS TO GROW IN ACCOMMODATE. CAL AND ALL ADDRESS THE HOUSE SHORTAGE AS AS A WHOLE OF THE GATES WERE MAKE. AWARE THAT WE'LL BE LOOKING AT THROUGH THE- BUDGET COMMITS BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE PROCESS THANK YOU MR. THANK YOU WILL GO TO MISTER RAMOS. AND THE METS FIGHTERS. AND THEN MISS GARCIA THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER- I HAVE A COMMENTED. QUESTIONS AND FIRST IN REGARDS TO THE- ONE TIME- PROP NINETY EIGHT ONE TIME FUNDING FOR TWO MILLION DOLLARS TO BUILD- CURRICULUM THE GOVERNOR'S PUT IN THERE. IN PARTICULARLY IN SUPPORT OF THE NATIVE AMERICAN EDUCATION- MAKING SURE THE CURRICULUM IS- FACTUALLY PORTRAYED. IN THE STATE I WANT TO THANK THE GOVERNOR FOR. PUTTING THAT IN THERE AND ALSO TESTING TO IS A- HAS A HAS PROMISED TO THE CALIFORNIA PEOPLE TO GET FACTUAL HISTORY. MOVING FORWARD AND MANY KNOW THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING HARD. ON THAT ASPECT WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK HARD AND PARTNERING WITH THE GOVERNOR TO MOVE THOSE AREAS FORWARD. THE QUESTION THAT I HAVE IS ON THE- RETAIL THEFT IN THE IN THE MONEY THAT'S BEING- PUT IN THERE AS FAR AS PUBLIC SAFETY. AND THE QUESTION IS THERE ANY- AND- HINDRANCE TO USING- TECHNOLOGY COMPONENTS FOR SOME OF THAT FUNDING THAT THAT. COULD BE OFFERED TO LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. YEAH I'M NOT SURE THERE'S ANY LIMITATIONS OR RESTRICTIONS ON THAT- USAGE OF THE FUNDING I'LL TURN THAT QUESTION TO JUSTIN IT AMEND IT TO CONFIRM NOT. GOOD AFTERNOON JUST NAY NEWMAN DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE RIGHT NOW WE DON'T HAVE ANY STIPULATIONS ABOUT YOU NO EXCLUSIONS FOR WHAT THE EIGHTY DAY. NINETY FIVE MILLION ANNUALLY- FOR VARIOUS GRANTS. BE PUT TOWARDS- SO THERE'S NO EXCLUSION RIGHT NOW ON WHAT CAN BE USED FOR. THANK THANK YOU FOR THAT AND THE REASON I BRING THAT UP IS BECAUSE THEY USE THE TECHNOLOGY- WHAT WITH. ONE HIGHER- OFFICERS AND DEPUTIES IS ONE THING BUT UTILIZING ONE TIME MONEY FOR TECHNOLOGY- IN PARTICULAR MAYBE SOME OTHER AREAS SUCH AS GPS TRACKERS THAT COULD- FOLLOW SOME OF THOSE RETAIL THEFTS AND MAKING SURE THAT WERE APPREHENDED. THOSE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE THERE SO I WANT TO PUT THAT IN- TE DISCUSSION BECAUSE A LOT OF TIMES WHEN PEOPLE SEE THE MONEY AND FUNDING GOING TOWARDS LAW ENFORCEMENT IT EQUATES TO- NEW DEPUTIES ARE NEW OFFICERS ON THE STREET BUT OF ITS ONE TIME FUNDING. IT COULD BUT IT PUTS SOME OF THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS IN A BIND FOR FUTURE FUNDING TO KEEP THOSE- MEMBERS- WITHIN THE FOREST BT ONE TIME MONEY GOING TOWARDS TECHNOLOGY. IS AN AREA THAT I WOULD LOVE TO EXPLORE AND TO- COME UP WITH SOME DIFFERENT IDEAS ON HOW WE CAN ACTUALLY CREATE- A PULL- THAT WE COULD PULL MONEY AND GRANTS FOR TECHNOLOGY USE WERE BATTLING. AREAS SUCH AS RETAIL THEFT. I WOULD LOVE TO WORK WITH- WITH THE ADMINISTRATION ON THAT. MY NEXT QUESTION GOES BACK TO- SOME OF THE MENTAL HEALTH COMPONENTS- CERTAINLY COVER NINETEEN HAS A- HAVE AN EFFECT. ON ALL OF US BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT WITH THE HOMELESS POPULATION THAT HAS A- HAD A DRASTIC EFFECT SO WE WANT TO. MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE SPEAKING UP ON THE MENTAL HEALTH COMPONENT THERE. BUT ALSO- BRINGING. TO THAT TO THE FRONT INTO THE FALL THE HOMELESS STUDENTS- IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THEY CONTINUED TO. LOOK FOR RESOURCES WITHIN MENTAL HEALTH. AND I KNOW THAT THE GOVERNOR WORKED ON THAT LAST- BUDGET CYCLE BUT WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN IT COMES TO- SUB ONE THAT THOSE ARE COMPONENTS THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE ASKING ABOUT. AS FAR AS MENTAL HEALTH FOR OUR HOMELESS YOUTH AND MENTAL HEALTH IN GENERAL- FOR OUR POPULATIONS SITE. JUST WANTED TO- LAY THAT SEAT OR EVEN ASK THE QUESTION. IS THE HOMELESS- YOUTH POPULATION ENGAGE- WITHIN- THE BUDGET- PROPOSAL. WITH ANY SPECIFIC RESOURCES- FOR. THAT SUB POPULATION IN GENERAL. SURE THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION MR ALMOST I WANT TO JUST POINT BACK TO LAST YEAR'S- INVESTMENT IN THAT. BEHAVIOR HEALTH SYSTEM FOR USE- THAT IT SO IT STARTED LAST YEAR WAS A MULTI YEAR- ENDEAVORED TO REALLY TRANSFORM BEHAVIOR HEALTH FOR OUR USE IN SCHOOLS AND OUTSIDE SCHOOLS- SO THERE'S BEST MEN'S AND- THAT THIS CURRENT YEAR AS WELL- BUT FOR FURTHER DETAILS I WILL. SEND IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE- RECORDED WITHIN OUR CAST. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION ONE ELEMENTARY GUESS WHAT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO SOME OF THE PROPOSALS AND THIS GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ARE FOR THE HOMELESS POPULATION IN GENERAL I WILL FOLLOW UP. WILL FOLLOW BACK WITH YOU- I'M MORE SPECIFICS- RELATED TO YOUR QUESTION ON- HOMELESS STUDENTS. THANK YOU AND THEN- I GUESS WILL FOLLOW UP WITH THAT DURING SOME WONDERING- REACH OUT TO MY OFFICE ON. WITH THAT RESPONSE. WELL RICHARD TO- BUDGET STAFF AND FIGURE OUT THE BEST WAY TO- COMMUNICATE WITH OFFICE THANK YOU THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU NOW WE'RE GOING TO MISS MY DEAREST MISS GARCIA THAN MR GALLAGHER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. AS MANY AS TWENTY OTHER STATES INCLUDING DELAWARE NEW HAMPSHIRE AND HAWAII UTILIZE FEDERAL OR SURPLUS MONEY TO PROVIDE RELIEF TO THEIR YOU AYE FUNDS TO HELP ADDRESS THE INSOLVENCY CAUSED BY THE PANDEMIC INCLUDING A SEVEN POINT TWO BILLION DOLLAR PAYMENT BY TEXAS CALIFORNIA PROPOSED THREE BILLION IN REPAYMENT- AS A STEP TO RELIEVING THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY FROM EXTENDED YEARS OF RISING FEDERAL UNEMPLOYMENT TAXES. YET DOES NOT CLEAR THEM COMPLETELY OF HIGHER TAXES IN ADDITION TO THIS PARTIAL REPAYMENT OF THE NINETEEN POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLAR DEBT WHICH INCLUDES THAT OF ONE POINT THREE BILLION DUE TO FRAUD THIS BODY AND THE GOVERNOR NEED TO PROVIDE LONG TERM ASSISTANCE AND SOLUTIONS TO DEAL WITH THE TRUST FUND INSOLVENCY. SO WE ALLOCATED. A BILLION DOLLARS THIS YEAR OR IN THE PROPOSAL THERE'S AN ALLOCATION OF A BILLION DOLLARS THIS YEAR AND TWO BILLION DOLLARS NEXT YEAR. IF WE CONTINUE TO PAY DOWN. TO PAY THIS DEBT DOWN AT THIS RATE DOES DOES EITHER THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND OR THE L. A. L. NOW. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION IS SO I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE HOW MUCH TIME HE SHAVED OFF AND- AT THE END BUT IT DOES HELP REDUCE RATES- WHAT IT HELPS THE STATE AS WELL AS EMPLOYERS. IN THE LONG TERM. SO IT WAS A ROUGHLY WEAKENED IF THE L. A. L. O. WANTS TO WIN HERE I MEAN COULD WE LOOK AT IF PAYING IT DOWN AT THIS RATE OF YOU KNOW TWO BILLION APPROXIMATELY A YEAR. BUT IT TAKES ABOUT A DECADE. YES- THIS IS GAVE PATRICK LEGISLATIVE ANALYST AND- ESCHEN WITH THE AMOUNT BEING PROPOSED. IF IT WERE CONTINUE TO. YOU KNOW SIMILAR AMOUNTS WENT FORWARD IN THE FUTURE I THINK WE'RE LOOKING AT SOMETHING THAT THE TOWARD THE END OF THE DECADE SEEKS. DEBT WOULD BE PAID DOWN BUT UNDER THE FEDERAL RULES AS YOU NOTED THE- THE EMPLOYERS WOULD BE SUBJECT TO AT YOU KNOW ZERO POINT 3% TAX INCREASE ON THEIR PAYROLL TAXES UNTIL THE TIME WHEN IT'S PAID DOWN SO. IF THE LEGISLATURE WERE INTERESTED IN PROVIDING MORE IMMEDIATE RELIEF THERE MIGHT BE OTHER OTHER ALTERNATIVE STATE WOULD WANT TO CONSIDER- AS OPPOSED TO THIS APPROACH. SO LAST YEAR THEY ADMINISTER MINISTRATION OF KNOWLEDGE THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO PAY DOWN DEBT- ON THE BACKS OF SMALL BUSINESS UNLESS WE- INVESTED MORE IN PAIN THIS DOWN ESPECIALLY WITH THESE ONE TIME SURPLUS DOLLARS THAT WE HAVE. SO WHAT IF WE'RE ONLY ALLOCATING GONNA ONE BILLION THIS YEAR TWO BILLION NEXT YEAR. WHEN WOULD YOU WANT ONE WITH THE ADMINISTRATION ANTICIPATE THAT BUSINESSES WOULD START TO SEE AN INCREASE IN THEIR E. Y. PAYMENTS. YES SO AS- MISTER PEDICLE SAYING THAT FOR EVERY YEAR THERE IS A BALANCE. OR SOME DEBT REMAINING IN A STATE THAT THE EMPLOYERS THAT PAY INTO THE TRUST FUND WOULD NOT SEE THAT CREDIT. AND SO THEY WOULD FEEL- INCREASED. COST OF STARTING NEXT YEAR JANUARY. THANK YOU I. I JUST LOOK AT THE OVER TWENTY TWO THOUSAND BUSINESSES THAT WERE PROBABLY CLOSE IN THE STATE. AND pARE STILL STRUGGLING AND I JUST HOPE THAT THAT WE CAN REALLY- PROVIDE SOME RAL REPRIEVE FOR THEM- AND ENSURE THAT WE'RE SUPPORTING THEM WHEN THEY NEED IT MOST THEY'VE BEEN HERE FOR US WHEN. WE NEED TO BE THERE FOR THEM. MY NEXT QUESTION IS AROUND AND- THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROVIDES EIGHT HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS TO ADD THIRTY SIX THOUSAND SUBSIDIZED CHILD CARE SLOTS ON TOP OF THE ONE HUNDRED AND TEN THOUSAND THAT WERE FUNDED IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET PACKAGE. I'M MOVING TOWARD THE GOAL OF ADDING A TOTAL OF TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND MORE SLOTS BY TWENTY FIVE TWENTY SIX- AND I AM EXCITED ABOUT THIS I HAVE SAID YOU KNOW- FROM THE GET GO THAT WE CANNOT EXPECT TO GET PEOPLE BACK TO WORK IF THEY DON'T HAVE CHILD COURT CARE- AND I THINK THIS IS EIGHT EIGHT GOAL HOWEVER IT'S REALLY UNCLEAR. UNCLEAR WHETHER THESE SLOTS CAN BE ACCESSED BY FAMILIES MOST NEEDED IT WHAT THE CURRENT INFRASTRUCTURE SO TO THAT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE OR- YET OR EVEN OUT OF THE ALLEY OWN YOU MAY HAVE SOME INSIGHT HERE WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE FIELD WITH IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RATE INCREASES STIPEND ALLOCATIONS AND THE ONE HUNDRED AND TEN- AND BUT NEED TO ADD NEW SLOTS THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO BE ADDED IN THE CURRENT YEAR AND DO WE HAVE AN ESTIMATE HOW MANY. SLOTS HAVE BEEN FILLED. YES THAT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE ASKING FOR A STATUS UPDATE ON- THE INVESTMENTS THAT WERE MADE AST YEAR I'M NOT SURE IF WE HAVE. THAT HANDY- I'LL SEE IF NYBODY ON THE LINE AS A FORMATION BUT I'D BE HAPPY TO GET THAT RESPONSE. BACKS YOU IN MORE DETAIL- MISTER DORSEY. ANYTHING TO ADD TO THAT. THIS IS TYLER WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I CAN TAKE THAT PART OF THAT QUESTION AT LEAST SO I KNOW THAT- MOST OF THE STIPENDS HAVE ALREADY GONE OUT THE DOOR- EVEN AS RECENTLY AS ABOUT. GO WE CAN PROVIDE YOUR OFFICE AN UPDATE THE L. ON THE SLOT AVAILABILITY AT THIS POINT I DON'T KNOW IF WE HAVE. A NUMBER OF BREAK OUT RIGHT NOW ON EXACTLY HOW MANY OF THOSE SLOTS ARE ACTIVE. I WOULD APPRECIATE THAT FOLLOW UP. I'M I'M HEARING FROM THE FIELDS YOU KNOW WE'VE HEARD FROM MANY YOU KNOW WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE MANY CHILD CARE FACILITIES I'VE CLOSED. I'M WOULD DOES THE ONLY- HAVE ANY INSIGHT AS TO WHETHER OR NOT. YOU KNOW THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY FIELD AND CAN ACTUALLY ACCOMMODATE THE THIRTY SIX THOUSAND. NEW SLOTS AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I DON'T SEE ANY ALLOCATION FOR THE WORK FORCE FOR CHILD CARE. AND INTO ONE OF THE BIGGEST CONCERNS IS THAT WERE WERE TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND SLOTS AND IT'S REALLY HARD TO RECRUIT. SO WHY WOULDN'T WE- PUT MONIES TOWARDS RECRUITMENT AND WORKFORCE. WELL I WILL I'LL- GET THAT QUESTION TO TYLER WHAT'S- SURE SO I THINK- TO PARTIALLY ADDRESS YOUR QUESTION I THINK THAT'S PART OF THE ONGOING DISCUSSION ABOUT RATE REFORMS THAT HOPEFULLY. AS RATES GET DEVELOPED IN A BETTER MORE SINGULAR WAY IN ADDITION TO ADDITIONAL FUNDING BUT THAT MIGHT BECOME MORE APPEALING AND HELP WITH SOME OF THE FIELD. AND RECRUITMENT EFFORTS BUT I JUST WANT TO ADD THAT THERE WAS FUNDING APPROPRIATE IN TWENTY ONE BUDGET ACT FOR THINGS LIKE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR FACILITY FACILITIES AND REHABILITATION. AS WELL AS THINGS LIKE THE STIPENDS AND SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING IN THE TWENTY ONE ACT IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE INCENTIVE TO KEEP WORKERS CONTINUING TO WORK AS WELL AS A RECRUITMENT EFFORT COULD ADD A AND- WITHIN THE COMPACT THAT WE PUT FORWARD FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY ONE OF THE AREAS OF FOCUS. IS INCREASING ENROLLMENT AND GRADUATION RATES UP WITHIN A CERTAIN AREAS I'M ONE OF THE AREAS OF FOCUS IS A PUBLICATION INCLUDING EARLY EDUCATION. OR OR EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATORS SO WE'RE CERTAINLY FOCUSED ON THAT AREA IN OUR COMPACTS- AS WELL AS THE ROAD MAP FOR THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES. ADDITIONALLY ONE OF THE AREAS OF FOCUS ON THE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT FOR COLLEGE AND CAREER PATHWAYS. IN OUR K. TWELVE SPACE ALSO FOCUSES ON EDUCATORS AND EARLY EDUCATION OR EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION- EDUCATORS AS WELL. THANK YOU ACT INCLUDE- LOOK FORWARD TO FURTHER DISCUSSION AROUND WORK FORCES SPECIFICALLY RUN EARLY CHILD CARE- NO FURTHER QUESTIONS THANK YOU. I THINK YOU'RE GONNA GONNA MISS GARCIA THE MISTER GALLAGHER AND THEN MISTER LEE- THANK YOU- I GUESS IS MORE COMMON THAN A QUESTION AND WILL BE. COVERING A LOT OF THIS AND BUDGET THE FIVE PUBLIC SAFETY BUT MR ALMOST BROUGHT UP THE MONEY PROPOSED OF TO ADDRESS ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT- AND SO I DO HAVE THAT COMMON GOAL I DO HOPE WE'LL START TO SEE SOME VERY DETAIL CENTURY AT THAT MONIES YOU SEEN BEING USED. WISELY BUT ALSO BEING USED FOR THE TENTH INTENDED PURPOSES OUT THERE AS OF PROPOSALS MOVE FORWARD AND I WOULD SAY THAT'S JUST IN GENERAL WE SAW A LOT OF PROPOSALS AND THERE'S A LOT OF MONEY FOR US TO WORK WITH AND THAT'S EXCITING BUT WITHOUT ANY DETAILS OF THESE PROPOSALS AND ADDITIONAL DOLLARS- IT CAN. TAKE A COUNTY TO UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES AND THAT MORE DAMAGE THAN GOOD ALONG THE WAY YES I HOPE THAT THESE PROPOSALS MOVE FORWARD THIS YEAR THAT WE HAVE A DIFFERENT- APPROACH AND LAST YEAR WE HAVE A LOT MORE DETAILS AND I JUST MUCH MONEY BEING THROWN OUT THERE. WITHOUT THAT ACCOUNTABILITY. I WELL- TO THAT TO COME IN AND THEN I A QUESTION YOU KNOW THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT THE PORTS. AND THE GOODS MOVEMENT- AND THE BACKLOGGED AT THE PORTS. THAT'S IN LARGE PART DUE BECAUSE WE HAVE RECORDS EVERY MONTH OF GOODS COMING INTO THAT PART. AND GOOD TECHNIQUE TO GET ON TRUCKS- TO GET OUT OF THAT PORT AND EITHER RUN THROUGH ONE SIDE OF MY DISTRICT TO THE AT THE OTHER END OF MY DISTRICT INTO. THEIR RAILYARD ARE INTO MY COLLEAGUES IN THE INLAND EMPIRE. AS WELL AND SO I APPRECIATE THE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE LANDS THAT THE GOVERNOR IS TRYING TO PUT AS WE LOOK AT OUR QUALITY- IT'S- ARE THERE DETAILS OF HOW ARE ALSO GOING TO ENSURE THAT AS WE DO WITH THAT BACKLOG WE'RE NOT OVER BURDENING. THE SAME COMMUNITIES THAT WE'RE TRYING TO SUPPORT WITH OTHER MEASURES IN THIS BUDGET- WHETHER THAT'S THROUGH ADDITIONAL TRUCKS MOVING A BUNCH OF EMPTY CONTAINERS INTO MY BACKYARD. AROUND MY BACKYARD. NOT IN AND OUT OF IT AND THAT WE HAVE ALREADY SEEN A LOT OF THIS AND TO CONTAINERSHIP ON THE MANY BROWN FEELS. MY DISTRICT AND THAT'S ALSO DELAYING SOME OF THE WORK WE HAVE TO CLEAN UP SOME OF THOSE BROWN FEELS. AND CONVERT THEM AND SO- ARE THERE ANY DETAILS ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO ENSURE THAT THAT SAME EQUITY LENS IS BEING USED AS WE DEAL WITH THE PORT CONGESTION. THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION- I WOULD JUST POINT OUT THAT A LOT OF THE INVESTMENTS THAT ARE RELATED TO THE PORTS. ARE IN. REPLACEMENT OF- BUT- VEHICLES THAT ARE. CONCRETE YOU KNOW GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS- AND WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO CLEAN UP IN TERMS OF. PROVIDING AN ADDITIONAL. ZERO EMISSION. EQUIPMENT AND OTHER TYPES OF TECHNOLOGY THAT WILL HELP TO. CREATE A CLEANER ENVIRONMENT THE AIR AROUND- THE PORTS THAT'S ONE THING- AND I KNOW THAT FOR ALSO ATTEMPTING TO FIND. PLACES AROUND THE STATE THAT HAVE. THAT WE CAN CARRY THOSE BIG CONTAINER TO THE ARMS- CREATING CONGESTION IN AND AROUND THE PORTS. BUT FOR A LITTLE MORE DETAIL I'LL TURN TO TREAT SICK HELP. FINANCE THE OTHER THING IN ADDITION TO WHAT ERROR- WOULD POINT TO THE DETAIL REGARDING ZERO EMISSION EQUIPMENT AND INFRASTRUCTURE. AT THE GAMES THEY'RE HELPING SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES WITH SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT YOU THAT YOU ASIDE IF WE DO HAVE- DETAIL FOR A NUMBER OF PARTS- PROPOSALS IN OUR BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL NOT SURE THAT GOES INTO THAT LEVEL OF DETAIL THAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR BUT HAPPY THAT YOU DISCUSSION OF COURSE BUT THIS PROPOSAL DURING THE SPRING. I JUST WANT. ONE EMPHASIZE THAT IN AND AROUND THE PORTS ARE MOSTLY ALL DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES ALONG THE SEVEN TEN FREEWAY- AND SO. WHILE WE NEED TO TRANSITION pIMMEDIATE AS REMOVING ALL THOSE IN TWO CONTAINERS TO A SPOT SOMEPLACE IN AND AROUND THE PORT. IT'S IN THE SAME DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THAT ARE ALREADY STRUGGLING WITH HEALTH. ISSUES WITH AND BECAUSE pIT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT. WE DON'T JUST TALK ABOUT THE POOR BUT WE TALK ABOUT THE WHOLE GOOD MOVEMENTS- IT TOGETHER IN THIS DISCUSSION SO JUST LOOK FORWARD-TO THAT DISCUSSION. AS AS THE YEAR MOVES FORWARD. THANK YOU WE WILL NOT GO TO MR GALLAGHER AND THE MISTRUTH. YES SR THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN- JUST FEW COMMENTS ON ITEMS IN THE BUDGET- I'LL START WITH WILDFIRE- AS I AGREE WITH MIKE WITH THE COMMENTS OF THE VICE CHAIR- WE REALLY NEED TO SEE THOSE REPORTS MUCH ACRES ARE BEING TREATED WITH THE MONEY ALLOCATED LAST YEAR I THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT- FOR YOU KNOW DISCUSSIONS THIS YEAR. AND MAKE SURE THAT- IS GETTING US TO THE GOAL OF THE FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES A YEAR- I'D ALSO HIGHLIGHT THE FIFTY MILLION ON REFORESTATION THERE WAS SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT THAT AS- AS BEING PART OF REFOREST IN AREAS THAT ARE RECENTLY BURNED. I JUST WANT TO REALLY EMPHASIZE- YEAH RIGHT NOW I'M IN IN THE NORTH STATE WERE DEAL WITH ABOUT A MILLION ACRE. BURN SCAR FROM THE DIXIE FIRE AND THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THERE'S JUST LIKE NOTHING OUT THERE. AND THEY JUST GO IN THERE AND START PLANTING SOME TREES IT'S- BURNED DEAD AND DYING TREES THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE. MILLION ACRES YOU HAVE TO GO ON THEIR FIRST TO THE FUELS REDUCTION- SALVAGE- WOOD AND TIMBER THAT YOU CAN. IN THESE AREAS AND DO THE FUELS REDUCTION AND THEN YOU CAN. YOU KNOW GOING TO DO THAT. THE REFORESTATION EFFORTS SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT- THAT WE DON'T LOSE FOCUS ON THE NEED TO DO THAT- AND AGAIN GETTING TOWARDS THAT FIVE HUNDRED. THOUSAND ACRES A YEAR GOAL- ON THE EDUCATION FRONT I DO WANT TO SEE IS FOCUS. AND THERE WAS SOME DISCUSSION LAST YEAR ABOUT DOING SOME SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING FOR THOSE- MIDSIZE RULE SCHOOLS THAT THAT HAVE HAD SOME DISPARITIES IN THEIR FUNDING- JUST BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT WE CALCULATE- FUNDS- AND ALSO GOT SHORT CHANGED. I WAS SOME OF THE- THE CODE FUNDING LAST. LAST YEAR'S I'D LIKE TO SEE IF WE COULD DO SOME SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING HELP SUPPORT THOSE SCHOOLS- OF THE FIVE HUNDRED ON HOUSINGS. SIDE THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION FOR THE INFILL INFRASTRUCTURE GRANTS PROGRAM GREAT PROGRAM- THERE'S ACTUALLY WE GOT SOME FUNDING IN CHICO FOR THAT PROGRAM TO- DO SOME OF ROAD WIDENING IT WAS THERE'S MUCH NEED THAT'S GOING TO BRING ON THREE HUNDRED. NEW UNITS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. ONE PROBLEM WE GOT A SEQUEL LAWSUIT RIGHT AFTER WE GOT THE GRANT AND THAT IS HOLDING UP. THIS PROJECT SO WE'RE GONNA NEED THAT COMBINE THAT WITH SOME SEEK REFORM TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE INFRASTRUCTURE PROPRIET JEX THAT WE NEED TO BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING- DON'T GET HELD UP- AND THEN LASTLY I JUST FOCUS ON ON THE ON THE CLIMATE DISCUSSION. I THINK WE REALLY NEED TO FOCUS ON THE CARBON CAPTURE TECHNOLOGY AND REALLY MAKING INVESTMENTS. THERE IT IT TO ME IT STRIKES THE PERFECT BALANCE OF PROTECTING JOBS IN THIS STATE. AND REACHING OUR CLIMATE GOALS AT THE GOT A REAL OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT- IF WE ALL WORK TOGETHER AND I THINK THERE- YOU KNOW OR- EVEN A YOU KNOW ALL BALL HIGHLIGHT JUST FROM. FROM MY STEP SOMETHING I CARE A LOT ABOUT BIOMASS. WE CAN CERTAINLY BUILD NEW BIOMASS PLANTS WITH CARBON CAPTURE TECHNOLOGY- IT CREATES THE CAN CREATE HYDROGEN. WE CAN DO THIS AND SO MANY DIFFERENT APPLICATIONS AND WE REALLY GOT TO GET IT RIGHT SO HOPEFULLY WE CAN- GET SOME REAL STRONG INVESTMENTS ON THAT FRONT AS WELL. THANK YOU. I THINK YOU WERE GOING TO THE MYSTERY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I JUST FIRST ONE STARTS IN COLLEGE AND I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT SPECIFIC PROGRAM SO FIRST I WANTED TO SAY I THINK IT'S THE RIGHT MOVE FOR CALIFORNIA TO BE FOCUSED ON THE AND- WELL N. O. L. A. N. RD TAX CREDITS TO REVITALIZE OUR ECONOMY. AND MAKE SURE ON THE RIGHT TRACK WHILE ALSO TAKING CARE OF OUR WORKERS AND ALSO IN COMBINATION THE SMALL BUSINESS GRANTS I THINK IS THE RIGHT STEP A LOT OF OUR SMALL BUSINESSES ESPECIALLY MY DISTRICT THAT ARE IMMIGRANT OWNED AND PEOPLE OF COLOR OWN ARE REALLY SUFFERING TO THIS PANDEMIC. BUT TO PIVOT TO MY QUESTION ALSO SOMETHING THAT IS VERY MUCH- ALL RIGHT NOW. IS THE- LOT OF STRUGGLING SMALL LANDLORDS AND TENANTS ACROSS THE STATE. IN MARCH. WE ARE ABOUT TO HAVE THOSE TENSE PROTECTIONS EXPIRE. BUT I REMEMBER LAST YEAR AND IN THE SPIRIT OF WHAT I SHOULD TALK ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY OVERSIGHT OVER LAST YEAR. WE'RE TALKING TO DESIGNING THE RENTAL RELIEF PROGRAM WE GET UPDATES. FROM THE AGENCIES BUT I TO MY KNOWLEDGE I DON'T THINK WE HAVE ANY UPDATES ABOUT THAT. SO I'VE BEEN READING EVEN MY LOCAL PAPER THAT. THERE ARE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF UNMET NEED AND RENTAL RELIEF PROGRAM. SO FIRST I JUST WANT TO ASK. HIM HOW MUCH MONEY. HAS BEEN REQUESTED BY STRUGGLING LANDLORDS IN THE STATE. AND HOW MUCH. HOW MUCH OF THAT SO HOW MUCH WHAT MONEY OF THAT HAS BEEN PAID. AND HOW MUCH OF IT OF THE REQUEST MONEY STILL SITTING ON PAID. YES THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION MISTER LEE I HAVE SOME OF THAT INFORMATION AND THEN I WILL TURN IT TO CHRIS COOK FOR SOME DETAILS BUT- AT THIS POINT AS OF. JANUARY SEVENTEENTH- NEARLY FOUR HUNDRED SIXTY SIX OUT ACTUALLY FOUR HUNDRED SIXTY SIX THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN TO BE EXACT. COMPLETED APPLICATIONS HAVE BEEN SUBMITTED FOR STATE RENTAL ASSISTANCE- APPROXIMATELY ONE POINT SEVEN EIGHT BILLION HAS BEEN PAID TO DATE. AND THAT'S PROVIDING BELIEVE TO OVER A HUNDRED FIFTY ONE THOUSAND HOUSEHOLDS- THAT'S SORT OF THE MOST UP TO DATE INFORMATION UP- ABOUT SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT YOU ASKED. I WILL TURN INTO CHRIS COOK TO SEE IF YOU CAN FILL IN THE GAPS. ACTUALLY I THINK. MISLI ADDRESSED A LOT OF THOSE QUESTIONS THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT I MISSED- WOULD YOU MIND REPEATING THE QUESTION. SURE SO I THANK YOU FOR THE ANSWER THAT HAVE PROVED WE HAVE ONE POINT SEVEN EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS OUT THE DOOR. THAT'S FORTY SIX THOUSAND COMPLETED APPLICATIONS HOW MANY APPROVED BUT PENDING APPLICATIONS ARE STILL WAITING FOR MONEY AND HOW MUCH MONEY WITH THE RESULT I WENT HOW MUCH MONEY. WOULD THAT AMOUNT TO. YES THANKS FOR REPEATING THAT I HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU ON ON. WHAT THE PENDING CLAIMS- APPLICATIONS ARE. TRYING I DON'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION IN FRONT OF ME AT THE FRONT FROM THE MEDIA STORIES I'M SAYING THEY S. A. B. C. STATE OFFICIAL ESTIMATE IT'S AN WE NEED AN ADDITIONAL TWO POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS THAT'S MORE THAN THE AMOUNT. EVEN GIVEN OUT RIGHT NOW. SO I DO HOPE IT'S A PRIORITY OF THE- ADMINISTRATION TO SEEKING FEDERAL HELP AND TO ALSO WORK AND JUMP TO. WORK AT A COOPER LEAVE US TO HELP- GET STRUGGLING LANDLORDS AND TENANTS THE MONEY TO RESERVE. AS A LOT OF JURISDICTIONS AT THE EVENT AND MY- IN MY DISTRICT THAT HAVE TIED THE EVICTION MORATORIUM TO PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. AND THAT MEANS A LOT OF LANDLORDS OUT THERE THAT I'VE BEEN STRUGGLING TO APPLY FOR MONEY. TO GET APPROVED AND YET WE'RE STILL WAITING AND WAITING AND WAITING FOR THE MONEY TO GET THERE. AND MEANWHILE THE CRISIS STILL IS PROLONGED AND I JUST MEAN FOR MORE MONEY SO I DO HOPE THAT. I AM I AM GOING THAT WILL PLAY SEVEN EIGHT. DOLLARS OF DISPERSED SOUNDS LIKE THE NEED IS MUCH MUCH LARGER THAN THAT OUT THERE. SO THANK YOU. YES AN ASSEMBLY MEMBER I WOULD JUST ADD THAT THE ADMINISTRATION CONTINUES TO ADVOCATE AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL FOR- ADDITIONAL- EMERGENCY RENTAL ASSISTANCE REALLOCATION DOLLARS INCLUDING- ONCE FOR. THE SECOND ROUND WHICH- COULD BE COMING OUT. AS SOON AS- NEXT MONTH BUT THEN ALSO IN THE COMING MONTHS THEREAFTER. THANK YOU WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT GONNA MISTER LUCKY.

HOWEVER THERE THERE'S A VERY GLARING. PROBLEM IN THAT THE ARE PROHIBITED PERSON SYSTEM BACKLOG. THAT'S IT FOR THOSE WHO MAY BE UNFAMILIAR WITH THAT THAT'S- THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE A COMMITTED VIOLENT CRIMES AND WHO ARE NOT PERMITTED TO HAVE WEAPONS WE KNOW THEY HAVE THEM. AND WE HAVE NOT RECOVERED THEM- I'D I WOULD HOPE THAT WE WOULD UNDERSTAND WITH OUR INCREASE IN VIOLENT CRIME RATES THAT- THOSE ARE VERY. LIKELY MORE LIKELY HIGH RISK INDIVIDUALS THAT NEED TO BE ON ARMED. THE LAST THING I WILL SAY IS THAT- I WISH AND I HOPE AND I WORK WITH IN THE SUB COMMITTEE PROCESS. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ADDRESS A VERY VERY CATASTROPHIC CIRCUMSTANCE IN MY DISTRICT WHICH IS. THE ILLICIT CANNABIS GROWS THAT ARE. ALL OVER THE PLACE IN THE DESERT AND OTHER CARTELS HAVE CLEARLY INVESTED MULTI BILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENTS IN THAT REGION AND THE STATE IS NOT EVEN PAYING ATTENTION.
