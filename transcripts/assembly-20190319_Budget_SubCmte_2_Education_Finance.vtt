ON SLIDE EIGHT THE NEXT PAGE --

00:45:25.689 --> 00:45:27.691
PROVIDES THIS CHART SHOWING HOW

00:45:27.758 --> 00:45:30.527
RAPIDLY UC'S RESIDENT

00:45:30.594 --> 00:45:32.262
UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS HAVE

GROWN OVER THE LAST SEVERAL

00:45:33.697 --> 00:45:34.798
YEARS.

00:45:34.865 --> 00:45:38.302
WE HAVE LET IN A LARGE NUMBER OF

00:45:38.368 --> 00:45:39.603
RESIDENT UNDERGRADUATES.

00:45:39.670 --> 00:45:42.406
AND THIS HAS BEEN EXTREMELY GOOD

00:45:42.473 --> 00:45:43.874
FOR OUR STUDENTS.

00:45:43.941 --> 00:45:45.542
BUT IT ALSO RESULTS IN SOME

00:45:45.609 --> 00:45:46.810
FINANCIAL NEEDS WERE THE

00:45:46.877 --> 00:45:49.046
UNIVERSITY DO STUDENTS NEED TO

00:45:49.113 --> 00:45:50.514
BE FINANCIALLY SUPPORTED --

00:45:50.581 --> 00:45:51.682
THEY NEED ADDITIONAL MENTAL

ADDITIONAL ACADEMIC COUNSELORS

00:45:55.018 --> 00:45:57.087
AND OBVIOUSLY THEY NEED.

00:45:57.154 --> 00:45:59.156
ADDITIONAL COURSES SO WE HAVE TO

00:45:59.223 --> 00:46:04.328
HIRE DE UM INSTRUCTORS FOR THEM.

00:46:04.394 --> 00:46:05.095
ON SLIDE.

00:46:05.162 --> 00:46:06.430
NINE I GO INTO THE UNFUNDED

00:46:06.497 --> 00:46:08.365
ENROLLMENT FOR THE UNIVERSITY

00:46:08.432 --> 00:46:09.900
AND THIS HAS --

00:46:09.967 --> 00:46:11.301
THIS ISSUE IS BECOMING QUITE

00:46:11.368 --> 00:46:14.938
SERIOUS FOR US AT THIS POINT --

00:46:15.005 --> 00:46:16.740
IF YOU LOOK AT THE CHART ON THE

00:46:16.807 --> 00:46:19.109
LEFT HAND SIDE YOU WILL SEE BY.

00:46:19.176 --> 00:46:21.445
THE ACADEMIC YEAR AND THE TOTAL

CALIFORNIA RESIDENT

00:46:22.913 --> 00:46:25.983
UNDERGRADUATES LISTED NEXT TO IT --

00:46:26.049 --> 00:46:28.152
THE NEXT COLUMN SHOWS THE GROWTH

00:46:28.218 --> 00:46:30.154
OR DECLINE FROM THE PRIOR YEAR

00:46:30.220 --> 00:46:31.922
HOW THOSE NUMBER TOTAL NUMBER OF

00:46:31.989 --> 00:46:33.991
RESIDENTS HAS FLUCTUATED IN THE

00:46:34.057 --> 00:46:35.526
UNIVERSITY.

00:46:35.592 --> 00:46:37.060
THE BUDGET ACT MANDATED GROWTH

00:46:37.127 --> 00:46:38.996
WAS THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING WE

00:46:39.062 --> 00:46:40.898
RECEIVED A NUMBER STUDENTS WE

00:46:40.964 --> 00:46:42.266
RECEIVED FUNDING.

00:46:42.332 --> 00:46:44.134
FOR IN THE BUDGET ACT THAT WAS

00:46:44.201 --> 00:46:45.502
IDENTIFIED NOW.

00:46:45.569 --> 00:46:48.038
I HAVE NOT DONE ANY SUBTRACTIONS

00:46:48.105 --> 00:46:50.307
FOR PARTIAL MARGINAL COST OR FOR

00:46:50.374 --> 00:46:50.607
YOU SEE --

00:46:50.674 --> 00:46:52.676
P. FUNDING OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT

00:46:52.743 --> 00:46:54.511
THIS IS THE AMOUNT OF STUDENTS

00:46:54.578 --> 00:46:56.313
THAT WE WERE IDENTIFIED TOGETHER

00:46:56.380 --> 00:46:58.749
IN OUR DISCUSSIONS IS BEING

00:46:58.815 --> 00:46:59.550
FUNDED.

00:46:59.616 --> 00:47:01.318
SO THE LAST COLUMN THERE IS THE

00:47:01.385 --> 00:47:03.754
UNFUNDED F. T. A GROWTH AND WE

00:47:03.820 --> 00:47:06.790

00:47:12.429 --> 00:47:14.164
STATE.

00:47:14.231 --> 00:47:16.567
THIS IS GRADING SEVERE PROBLEMS

00:47:16.633 --> 00:47:17.701
ON OUR CAMPUSES.

00:47:17.768 --> 00:47:20.370

STUDENTS ARE NOT ABLE TO ALWAYS

00:47:29.546 --> 00:47:31.415
GET INTO THE COURSES THEY NEED

00:47:31.481 --> 00:47:33.317

00:50:03.633 --> 00:50:05.001
ON HOW THEY WOULD HELP THE

00:50:05.068 --> 00:50:06.169
DIVERSE ENVIRONMENT OF THE

00:50:06.236 --> 00:50:07.637
UNIVERSITY --

00:50:07.704 --> 00:50:09.706
AND ALSO A DIFFERENT RECRUITMENT

00:50:09.773 --> 00:50:11.575
PRACTICES AND WHERE TO ADVERTISE

00:50:11.641 --> 00:50:13.610
AND SO FORTH THOSE ALL HELPED.

00:50:13.677 --> 00:50:15.278
SO THAT'S A BRIEF LOOK AT WHO

00:50:15.345 --> 00:50:16.913
OUR STUDENTS ARE AND WHAT WE'VE

00:50:16.980 --> 00:50:19.149
BEEN DOING TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT

00:50:19.216 --> 00:50:23.053
OUR UNIVERSITY'S FACULTY

00:50:23.120 --> 00:50:25.789
REFLECTS OUR STUDENT BODY.

00:50:25.856 --> 00:50:27.457
ON PAGE ELEVEN WE HAVE OUR

00:50:27.524 --> 00:50:28.792
UNDERGRADUATE NON RESIDENT

00:50:28.859 --> 00:50:29.726
ENROLLMENT GROWTH.

00:50:29.793 --> 00:50:31.895
WHICH YOU HAVE YOU WILL SEE HAS

00:50:31.962 --> 00:50:33.230
BEEN GROWING --

00:50:33.296 --> 00:50:35.799
AFTER STATE FUNDING WAS BROUGH

00:50:35.866 --> 00:50:37.300
BACK -- IN

00:50:37.367 --> 00:50:40.036
FUNDING ARE NON RESIDENT NUMBERS

00:50:40.103 --> 00:50:43.707
ALSO GREW --

00:50:43.774 --> 00:50:46.109
YOU WILL SEE THE NON RESIDENTS

00:50:46.176 --> 00:50:47.411
REPRESENTED BY TWO YELLOW BAR

00:50:47.477 --> 00:50:49.346
HAVE BEEN INCREASING OVER THE

00:50:49.413 --> 00:50:50.547
LAST DECADE.

00:50:50.614 --> 00:50:52.215
ARE NON RESIDENT ROMAN HAS

00:50:52.282 --> 00:50:53.450
BECOME A SIGNIFICANT SOURCE OF

00:50:53.517 --> 00:50:54.818
CORE FUND REVENUES FOR TO

00:50:54.885 --> 00:50:56.820
UNIVERSITY YOU WILL RECALL IN

00:50:56.887 --> 00:50:58.455
THE EARLIER PAGE WHERE WE TALKED

00:50:58.522 --> 00:51:00.090
ABOUT THE TOTAL COR FUNDS OF THE

00:51:00.157 --> 00:51:01.458
UNIVERSITY.

00:51:01.525 --> 00:51:02.893
THAT NON RESIDENT SUPPLEMENTAL

00:51:02.959 --> 00:51:05.228
TUITION IS NOW AT ONE POINT

00:51:05.295 --> 00:51:05.996
EIGHT WHAT SORRY.

00:51:06.062 --> 00:51:07.597
MY APOLOGIES ONE POINT THREE

00:51:07.664 --> 00:51:08.899
BILLION.

00:51:08.965 --> 00:51:11.802
ANNUALLY.

00:51:11.868 --> 00:51:13.203
IN REVENUES FOR THE UNIVERSITY --

00:51:13.270 --> 00:51:14.638
THE REGION'S ON MARCH FOURTEENTH

00:51:14.704 --> 00:51:16.940
DECIDED TO DELAY A VOTE TO

00:51:17.007 --> 00:51:17.808
INCREASE NON RESIDENT

00:51:17.874 --> 00:51:19.609
SUPPLEMENTAL TUITION BY TWO

00:51:19.676 --> 00:51:20.744
POINT 6%.

00:51:20.811 --> 00:51:22.012
AND THAT INCREASE WOULD HAVE

00:51:22.078 --> 00:51:22.879
YIELDED --

00:51:22.946 --> 00:51:24.481
ABOUT TWENTY NINE MILLION IN NEW

00:51:24.548 --> 00:51:26.216
REVENUE FOR THE UNIVERSITY BUT

00:51:26.283 --> 00:51:28.051
IT'S STILL BEING DEBATED.

00:51:28.118 --> 00:51:30.420
ON THE NEXT SLIDE --

00:51:30.487 --> 00:51:31.288
I WANTED TO SHOW YOU HOW OUR

00:51:31.354 --> 00:51:33.290
CORE FANS HAVE SHOWN OVER THE

00:51:33.356 --> 00:51:38.662
LAST EIGHTEEN YEARS.

00:51:38.728 --> 00:51:40.030
ON THE FAR LEFT YOU'LL SEE THAT

00:51:40.096 --> 00:51:42.632
INFLATION ADJUSTED DOLLARS THE

00:51:42.699 --> 00:51:44.301
UNIVERSITY HAS GROWN IT'S

00:51:44.367 --> 00:51:48.472
FUNDING BY ABOUT 8% SINCE.

00:51:48.538 --> 00:51:49.539
TWO THOUSAND SIR TOTAL FUNDING

00:51:49.606 --> 00:51:52.108
DOLLAR WISE HAS BEEN GOING UP --

00:51:52.175 --> 00:51:55.312
INCLUDED IN THAT AMOUNT IS ARE

00:51:55.378 --> 00:51:57.414
NON RESIDENT --

00:51:57.481 --> 00:52:01.051
SUPPLEMENTAL TUITION --

00:52:01.117 --> 00:52:02.352
AND THE SUBCOMMITTEE HAS BEEN

00:52:02.419 --> 00:52:03.420
THIS SUBCOMMITTEE HAS BEEN A

00:52:03.487 --> 00:52:04.921
SIGNIFICANT PARTNER IN

00:52:04.988 --> 00:52:05.989
INCREASING THIS AMOUNT OF

00:52:06.056 --> 00:52:07.357
FUNDING.

00:52:07.424 --> 00:52:08.859
OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS YOU

00:52:08.925 --> 00:52:10.494
VOTED EACH YEAR TO PROVIDE TO

00:52:10.560 --> 00:52:13.263
UNIVERSITY WITH MORE RESOURCES --

00:52:13.330 --> 00:52:15.632
FOR OUR CORE MISSION AND WE'RE

00:52:15.699 --> 00:52:17.234
VERY GRATEFUL FOR THAT.

00:52:17.300 --> 00:52:18.568
IN THE MIDDLE CHARGE YOU WILL

00:52:18.635 --> 00:52:20.637
SEE THE TOTAL NUMBER OF STUDENTS

00:52:20.704 --> 00:52:24.541
IN THE UNIVERSITY.

00:52:24.608 --> 00:52:25.675
AND YOU'LL SEE THAT OUR

00:52:25.742 --> 00:52:27.544
ENROLLMENT HAS SKYROCKETED BY

00:52:27.611 --> 00:52:30.881
ABOUT 59% SINCE.

00:52:30.947 --> 00:52:31.581
TWO THOUSAND THAT'S A

00:52:31.648 --> 00:52:34.050
SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN STUDENTS

00:52:34.117 --> 00:52:35.285
ON OUR CAMPUSES.

00:52:35.352 --> 00:52:36.653
THAT NUMBER INCLUDES NON

00:52:36.720 --> 00:52:38.288
RESIDENTS AS DOES THE CORE FUNDS

00:52:38.355 --> 00:52:40.457
BAR ON THE FAR LEFT INCLUDE THE

NON RESIDENT SUPPLEMENTAL

00:52:42.192 --> 00:52:42.993
TUITION.

00:52:43.059 --> 00:52:44.995
ONCE THIS DRAMATIC GROWTH IN

00:52:45.061 --> 00:52:46.630
STUDENT SUCCESS ACCESS IS

00:52:46.696 --> 00:52:48.365
ACCOUNTED FOR THE DOLLARS PER

00:52:48.431 --> 00:52:50.166
STUDENT AVAILABLE TO THE

00:52:50.233 --> 00:52:52.068
CAMPUSES FOR INSTRUCTIONS ON

00:52:52.135 --> 00:52:53.169
OPERATIONS.

00:52:53.236 --> 00:52:56.106
THE SO CALLED CORE FUNDS PURSED

00:52:56.172 --> 00:53:00.443
DECREASED BY 32% SINCE.

00:53:00.510 --> 00:53:01.311
TWO THOUSAND THIS IS.

00:53:01.378 --> 00:53:03.179
OF FORCING OUR CAMPUSES TO WORK

00:53:03.246 --> 00:53:04.648
SMARTER AND HARDER WHICH THEY

00:53:04.714 --> 00:53:06.449
CERTAINLY HAVE DONE WE HAVE

00:53:06.516 --> 00:53:07.918
MULTIPLE INITIATIVES TO SAVE

00:53:07.984 --> 00:53:09.119
FUNDING --

00:53:09.185 --> 00:53:12.789
FROM PROCUREMENT TO ENERGY TO

00:53:12.856 --> 00:53:16.026
OUR OF SELF INSURANCE PROGRAM UP

00:53:16.092 --> 00:53:17.694
AND ELIMINATING --

00:53:17.761 --> 00:53:19.296
TUITION FINANCIAL AID FOR NON

00:53:19.362 --> 00:53:21.031
RESIDENTS --

00:53:21.097 --> 00:53:22.432
BUT CAMPUSES ARE STILL

00:53:22.499 --> 00:53:24.634
STRUGGLING.

00:53:24.701 --> 00:53:26.336
WHAT ARE SOME OF THE IMPACTS OF

00:53:26.403 --> 00:53:27.904
THE SONS PAGE THIRTEEN YOU'LL

00:53:27.971 --> 00:53:29.973
SEE THE STUDENT TO FACULTY RATIO

00:53:30.040 --> 00:53:31.341
AT UC HAS CAUGHT BEEN THE

00:53:31.408 --> 00:53:32.542
CLIMBING?

00:53:32.609 --> 00:53:33.944
SO WE HAVE FEWER LETTERING

00:53:34.010 --> 00:53:37.047
FACULTY AND FEWER LECTURES EVEN --

00:53:37.113 --> 00:53:39.249
FIRST FOUR PER STUDENT STAND OUR

00:53:39.316 --> 00:53:43.019
PUBLIC COMPARISON INSTITUTIONS.

00:53:43.086 --> 00:53:44.454
WHAT THIS DOES IT HAS --

00:53:44.521 --> 00:53:45.822
OVERALL NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON

00:53:45.889 --> 00:53:48.758
QUALITY.

00:53:48.825 --> 00:53:49.859
THE MOST IMMEDIATE TANGIBLE

00:53:49.926 --> 00:53:51.461
IMPACT ON THE STUDENTS HAS BEEN

00:53:51.528 --> 00:53:52.629
THAT THE AMOUNT OF TIME A LOT

00:53:52.696 --> 00:53:54.497
AROUND FACULTY HAVE AVAILABLE TO

00:53:54.564 --> 00:53:56.132
MENTOR AND PROVIDE INDIVIDUAL

ATTENTION TO STUDENTS.

00:53:57.634 --> 00:53:59.436
BOTH GRADUATE AND UNDERGRADUATE

00:53:59.502 --> 00:54:02.339

AN ON SLIDE FOURTEEN YOU'LL SEE

00:54:04.841 --> 00:54:07.043
SOME OF THE IMPACTS AS REPORTED

00:54:13.183 --> 00:54:14.050
STUDENTS.

00:54:14.117 --> 00:54:15.552
AND WE'VE BEEN NOTING SOME

00:54:15.619 --> 00:54:18.288
TROUBLING TRENDS.

00:54:18.355 --> 00:54:19.623

WHETHER OR NOT THEY WOULD STILL

00:54:22.859 --> 00:54:24.661
AND ROLL LIKE YOU SEE AFTER TO

00:54:24.728 --> 00:54:26.596
EXPERIENCE --

00:54:26.663 --> 00:54:28.098
THEIR EXPERIENCE AT THE CAMPUS.

00:54:28.164 --> 00:54:30.200
WE HAVE SEEN A DROP FROM 33% OF

00:54:30.266 --> 00:54:32.335
STUDENTS STRONGLY AGREEING THAT

00:54:32.402 --> 00:54:34.104
THEY WOULD STILL AND ROLL TO NOW

00:54:34.170 --> 00:54:35.238
18%.

00:54:35.305 --> 00:54:36.973
OF AGREEING THAT'S BEEN IN THE

00:54:37.040 --> 00:54:40.176
LAST TEN YEARS THAT WE'VE SEEN

00:54:40.243 --> 00:54:41.478
THE STROP --

00:54:41.544 --> 00:54:42.979
WHAT'S BEHIND THESE NUMBERS ARE

00:54:43.046 --> 00:54:44.681
THE EVERYDAY EXPERIENCES THAT

00:54:44.748 --> 00:54:46.082
STUDENTS HAVE OF OVERCROWDED

00:54:46.149 --> 00:54:48.685
CLASSROOMS WAIT TIMES TO SPEAK

00:54:48.752 --> 00:54:50.286

ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE PAGE

00:54:55.625 --> 00:54:57.293
YOU'LL SEE EVEN MORE TROUBLING

TRENDS.

00:54:58.728 --> 00:55:02.198
I'M BACK IN 200063% OF STUDENTS

CHOICE. TEN YEARS LATER IN

00:55:08.605 --> 00:55:09.172
TWENTY SIXTEEN THIS NUMBER HAD

00:55:09.239 --> 00:55:12.375
INCREASED 213% OF STUDENTS NOT

00:55:12.442 --> 00:55:14.844
GETTING INTO THEIR FIRST MAJOR.

00:55:14.911 --> 00:55:16.479
WHEN STUDENTS CAN STUDY THE

00:55:16.546 --> 00:55:18.048
SUBJECT THAT THEY'RE PASSIONATE

00:55:18.114 --> 00:55:19.582
ABOUT THERE'S A LOSS OF PERSONAL

00:55:19.649 --> 00:55:22.252
POTENTIAL AND OF FRUSTRATION AT

A SITUATION THAT COULD BE BUT A

00:55:23.853 --> 00:55:26.189
COULD BE FIXED BY HIRING MORE

00:55:26.256 --> 00:55:26.389
FROM?

00:55:26.456 --> 00:55:28.658
INSTRUCTORS.

00:55:28.725 --> 00:55:29.993
OUR UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS ARE

00:55:30.060 --> 00:55:31.261
ALSO FEELING LESS CONNECTED TO

00:55:31.327 --> 00:55:33.463

STUDENTS WHO FEEL THEY KNOW

00:55:37.033 --> 00:55:39.135
THEIR FACULTY MEMBER MEMBER WELL

00:55:39.202 --> 00:55:40.470
ENOUGH TO ASK FOR A LETTER OF

00:55:40.537 --> 00:55:41.604
RECOMMENDATION.

00:55:41.671 --> 00:55:42.405
AT THE START OF THEIR

00:55:42.472 --> 00:55:44.574
UNDERGRADUATE STUDIES 39% OF YOU

00:55:44.641 --> 00:55:47.210
SEE STUDENTS EXPRESS AN INTENT

00:55:47.277 --> 00:55:48.445
TO GO TO GRADUATE SCHOOL.

00:55:48.511 --> 00:55:49.746

SCHOOL AND EARNINGS

00:55:50.947 --> 00:55:52.348
SIGNIFICANTLY MORE MONEY

00:55:52.415 --> 00:55:53.717
THROUGHOUT THEIR CAREERS THAN

PLANS TO ATTEND GRADUATE SCHOOL

00:56:02.959 --> 00:56:04.494
MAY BE PUT ON HOLD.

00:56:04.561 --> 00:56:05.729
AS MIGHT BE OTHER ACTIVITIES

00:56:05.795 --> 00:56:07.097
THAT REQUIRE LETTERS OF

00:56:07.163 --> 00:56:08.231
RECOMMENDATION.

00:56:08.298 --> 00:56:11.101
SUCH A STUDY ABROAD IN APPLYING

00:56:11.167 --> 00:56:13.036
FOR EXTERNAL SCHOLARSHIPS.

00:56:13.103 --> 00:56:14.637
AND THE FINAL SLIDE ON THE

PLAN FOR BLATTER RANG FACULTY ON

00:56:37.060 --> 00:56:39.262
TOP OF THE FACULTY NEEDED TO

00:56:39.329 --> 00:56:41.731
SIMPLY REPLACE THOSE WHO ARE

00:56:41.798 --> 00:56:43.032
LEAVING ON RETIRING.

00:56:43.099 --> 00:56:44.734
WE WANT TO USE THE ENROLLMENT

00:56:44.801 --> 00:56:46.503
FUNDING THAT I DISCUSSED EARLIER

00:56:46.569 --> 00:56:48.304
THAT SEVENTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS

00:56:48.371 --> 00:56:51.241
WE WANT TO USE IT TO HIRE TWO

00:56:51.307 --> 00:56:52.442
HUNDRED SIXTY SEVEN NEW FACULTY

00:56:52.509 --> 00:56:53.977
FAR UC CAMPUSES.

00:56:54.043 --> 00:56:56.446
IN ORDER TO TEACH COURSES AND

00:56:56.513 --> 00:56:58.448

ADDITIONAL GRANTS TO THE

00:57:02.585 --> 00:57:04.287
CALIFORNIA ECONOMY AND THAT

00:57:04.354 --> 00:57:05.555
CONCLUDES MY PRESENTATION ON

00:57:05.622 --> 00:57:07.724
ENROLLMENT.

00:57:07.791 --> 00:57:09.125
THANK YOU SIR OKAY [inaudible]

00:57:09.192 --> 00:57:10.960

ENTERTAIN QUESTIONS ON THE

00:57:13.963 --> 00:57:16.266
ENROLLMENT --

00:57:16.332 --> 00:57:17.834
AS GENDER ITEM.

00:57:17.901 --> 00:57:20.436
ALL OF A FEW BUT WHICH TO MAKE

00:57:20.503 --> 00:57:21.871
IT MAKE COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR

00:57:21.938 --> 00:57:22.539
ASSEMBLYMEMBER LAMONT THANK YOU.

00:57:22.605 --> 00:57:24.107
THERE IS A LOT OF DISCUSSION

00:57:24.174 --> 00:57:27.177
ABOUT THE ROLE THAT FACULTY

00:57:27.243 --> 00:57:29.445
PLAYS AND I'M JUST CURIOUS IF.

00:57:29.512 --> 00:57:30.713
YOU KNOW THAT THE THE HOW THE

00:57:30.780 --> 00:57:32.615
ACADEMIC SENATE OVERALL FOR THE

00:57:32.682 --> 00:57:35.952
SYSTEM IS RESPONDING TO SOME.

00:57:36.019 --> 00:57:40.824
OF THE AND THE NOT SO GREAT

00:57:40.890 --> 00:57:43.860
BENEFITS OF THE CHANGES IN

00:57:43.927 --> 00:57:44.761
FUNDING --

00:57:44.828 --> 00:57:46.429
AND SPECIFICALLY WHEN THEY'RE

00:57:46.496 --> 00:57:48.164
NOT ABLE TO MENTOR WHEN THEY'RE

00:57:48.231 --> 00:57:49.599
NOT ABLE TO KIND OF CULTIVATE

00:57:49.666 --> 00:57:52.969
THE NEXT RESEARCHERS THE NEXT --

00:57:53.036 --> 00:57:54.971
GRADUATE STUDENTS PER SE I KNOW

00:57:55.038 --> 00:57:56.406
THAT WHEN I MEAN THAT SOME OF

00:57:56.472 --> 00:57:57.340
THE WORK THAT I DID WHEN I

00:57:57.407 --> 00:57:58.308
WORKED AT THE UC AND THAT WAS

00:57:58.374 --> 00:57:59.809
REALLY IMPORTANT FOR FACULTY SO

00:57:59.876 --> 00:58:01.044
I'M JUST CURIOUS HOW THEIR AT

00:58:01.110 --> 00:58:02.645
THE PRACTICALITY OF HOW THEY'RE

00:58:02.712 --> 00:58:03.813
RESPONDING TO THIS.

00:58:03.880 --> 00:58:05.281
I MEAN WHAT ARE FACTORED I I'M

00:58:05.348 --> 00:58:06.883
SURE THEY'RE NOT HAPPY BUT WHAT

00:58:06.950 --> 00:58:11.487
ARE THEY TRYING TO DO --

00:58:11.554 --> 00:58:12.088
GIVEN HOW.

00:58:12.155 --> 00:58:13.189
I MEAN THEY'RE LIMITED

00:58:13.256 --> 00:58:13.489
[inaudible]

00:58:13.556 --> 00:58:17.493
RESOURCES --

00:58:17.560 --> 00:58:20.363
FACULTY NEED TIME TO MENTOR

00:58:20.430 --> 00:58:22.765
THEIR GRADUATE STUDENTS THE PHD

00:58:22.832 --> 00:58:23.299
STUDENTS AND THAT'S WHERE

00:58:23.366 --> 00:58:26.636
THEY'RE PUTTING THEIR ATTENTION --

00:58:26.703 --> 00:58:27.937
TO WHICH IS WHY WE SEE THE DROP

00:58:28.004 --> 00:58:30.106
IN UNDERGRADUATES HAVING.

00:58:30.173 --> 00:58:32.375
ACCESS TO SOME OF THE FACULTY

00:58:32.442 --> 00:58:33.376
IT'S A STE --

00:58:33.443 --> 00:58:34.844
WHEN THE FACULTY DON'T HAVE ANY

00:58:34.911 --> 00:58:36.179
TIME AND WHEN THEY HAVE TOO MANY

00:58:36.246 --> 00:58:37.881
STUDENTS I THINK THAT'S ONE OF

00:58:37.947 --> 00:58:39.816
THE REAL IMPACTS OF IT --

00:58:39.883 --> 00:58:41.584
THE FACULTY ARE ALSO FORCED TO

00:58:41.651 --> 00:58:43.086
SEEK MORE OF THEIR OWN GRANTS

00:58:43.152 --> 00:58:44.854
BECAUSE THE UNIVERSITY CAN'T

00:58:44.921 --> 00:58:46.489
HELP THEM WITH --

00:58:46.556 --> 00:58:47.891
THE BASICS FOR RUNNING THEIR

00:58:47.957 --> 00:58:51.461
LABS OR THE FUNDING FOR THEIR

00:58:51.527 --> 00:58:54.063
GRADUATE STUDENT FACULTY ARE

00:58:54.130 --> 00:58:55.231
HAVING TO PAY FOR THOSE GRADUATE

00:58:55.298 --> 00:58:57.567
STUDENT RESEARCH ASSISTANTS FROM.

00:58:57.634 --> 00:58:59.035
THEIR OWN GRANTS THEIR SALARY

00:58:59.102 --> 00:59:00.270
AND THE FEE REMISSION FOR THOSE

00:59:00.336 --> 00:59:01.771
GRADUATE STUDENTS COMES OUT OF

00:59:01.838 --> 00:59:02.972
THE FACULTIES.

00:59:03.039 --> 00:59:04.641
GRANTS SO THAT THERE'S MORE

00:59:04.707 --> 00:59:07.243
PRESSURE ON THE FACULTY --

00:59:07.310 --> 00:59:08.912
TO APPLY FOR GRANTS SOME OF THE

00:59:08.978 --> 00:59:10.713
CAMPUSES ACTUALLY I THINK ALL OF

00:59:10.780 --> 00:59:12.315
THEM -- AS

00:59:12.382 --> 00:59:14.150
STATE BEEN EXPERIENCING COST

00:59:14.217 --> 00:59:16.352
PRESSURES HAVE TRIED --

00:59:16.419 --> 00:59:18.521
TO POOL STAFF BETWEEN MULTIPLE

00:59:18.588 --> 00:59:20.023
DEPARTMENTS SO DEPARTMENTS NO

00:59:20.089 --> 00:59:21.057
LONGER HAVE THEIR INDIVIDUAL

00:59:21.124 --> 00:59:23.192
STAFF BUT THEY WILL FOR EXAMPLE

00:59:23.259 --> 00:59:25.328
HIGHER ONE INDIVIDUAL FOR A

00:59:25.395 --> 00:59:28.231
MULTITUDE OF DEPARTMENTS WHO

00:59:28.298 --> 00:59:29.532
HELPS THE FACULTY.

00:59:29.599 --> 00:59:30.066
WITH ADDED IN THERE GRANT

00:59:30.133 --> 00:59:32.201
PROPOSALS AND MANAGING THEM

00:59:32.268 --> 00:59:33.536
FINANCES A COMMON FOR THOSE

00:59:33.603 --> 00:59:37.040
GRANTS SO INSTEAD OF BACK IN THE

00:59:37.106 --> 00:59:39.142
DISTANT PAST THEY USED TO HAVE --

00:59:39.208 --> 00:59:40.476
AND A LARGE APARTMENT WOULD HAVE

00:59:40.543 --> 00:59:42.211
THEIR OWN PERSON TO HELP THE

00:59:42.278 --> 00:59:43.413
FACULTY WITHOUT NOW THEY SHARE

00:59:43.479 --> 00:59:46.382
THOSE PEOPLE ACROSS DEPARTMENTS

00:59:46.449 --> 00:59:48.451
IF THEY CAN'T AFFORD A FULL

00:59:48.518 --> 00:59:50.153
LEFTY ANYMORE.

00:59:50.219 --> 00:59:51.554
THANK YOU I THINK THAT THOSE ARE

00:59:51.621 --> 00:59:52.822
SOME REAL CONCERNS I MEAN ONE OF

00:59:52.889 --> 00:59:54.590
THE THINGS THAT MAKES ANY

00:59:54.657 --> 00:59:56.459
UNIVERSITIES REPUTATION --

00:59:56.526 --> 00:59:58.294
SKYROCKET OR NOT IS THE LEVEL OF

00:59:58.361 --> 00:59:59.762
RESEARCH AND FACULTY THERE I

00:59:59.829 --> 01:00:01.130
MEAN THAT'S HOW IT'S DRIVEN AND

01:00:01.197 --> 01:00:03.232
IT'S A TRICKLE EFFECT BECAUSE

01:00:03.299 --> 01:00:04.233
THERE ARE FACULTY WHO ARE

01:00:04.300 --> 01:00:07.670
SEEKING POSITIONS BASED ON AT

01:00:07.737 --> 01:00:09.472
THEIR ABILITY TO WORK WITH

01:00:09.539 --> 01:00:10.773
GRADUATE STUDENTS AND UNDERGRADS

01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:12.008
AND WHAT THAT MEANS FOR THEIR

01:00:12.075 --> 01:00:13.710
RESEARCH FOR THEIR LAB. FOR

01:00:13.776 --> 01:00:16.412
THEIR POTENTIAL TO APPLY TO GROW.

01:00:16.479 --> 01:00:18.815
AND I CERTAINLY HOPE THAT WE

01:00:18.881 --> 01:00:20.183
THINK ABOUT THAT I THINK IT'S

01:00:20.249 --> 01:00:22.051
SOMETIMES EASY TO REMOVE THE

01:00:22.118 --> 01:00:23.486
STUDENT EXPERIENCE FROM THE

01:00:23.553 --> 01:00:25.154
FACULTY EXPERIENCE BUT AT LEAST --

01:00:25.221 --> 01:00:27.256
FROM THE WORK THAT I DID AT THE

01:00:27.323 --> 01:00:29.092
UC IT'S I MEAN THERE THERE

01:00:29.158 --> 01:00:30.493
REALLY TANGIBLE.

01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:32.195
THEY GO HAND IN HAND --

01:00:32.261 --> 01:00:34.430
AND I WOULD HATE TO SEE A WORLD

01:00:34.497 --> 01:00:35.098
WHERE.

01:00:35.164 --> 01:00:37.700
AT OTHER UNIVERSITIES ARE SO

01:00:37.767 --> 01:00:39.502
MUCH MORE.

01:00:39.569 --> 01:00:41.237
COMPETITIVE WITH US THAT WE

01:00:41.304 --> 01:00:43.006
START TO LOSE --

01:00:43.072 --> 01:00:44.707
THE ABILITY TO TRACK THE BEST

01:00:44.774 --> 01:00:46.542
FACULTY WHICH ATTRACTS THE BEST

01:00:46.609 --> 01:00:48.511
STUDENTS WHICH ATTRACTS I THINK

01:00:48.578 --> 01:00:49.779
YOU KNOW INVESTMENTS --

01:00:49.846 --> 01:00:51.781
BOTH FROM OUTSIDE THE UNIVERSITY

01:00:51.848 --> 01:00:53.549
AND OUR INVESTMENTS I I JUST

01:00:53.616 --> 01:00:55.752
WANT TO CAUTION US ABOUT THAT

01:00:55.818 --> 01:00:58.054
BECAUSE AS SOMEONE WHO WORKED

01:00:58.121 --> 01:01:00.256
VERY DIRECTLY WITH STUDENTS AND

01:01:00.323 --> 01:01:01.557
FACULTIES AND BUILDING THAT

01:01:01.624 --> 01:01:02.792
RESEARCH BRIDGE --

01:01:02.859 --> 01:01:05.428
I FOUND IT PARTICULARLY HELPFUL --

01:01:05.495 --> 01:01:07.497
NOT JUST FOR THE FACULTY MEMBER

01:01:07.563 --> 01:01:09.732
OR THE INSTITUTION BUT THE

01:01:09.799 --> 01:01:12.435
STUDENTS THEMSELVES IT OPENED UP

01:01:12.502 --> 01:01:13.569
PROFESSIONAL CAREER

01:01:13.636 --> 01:01:15.338
OPPORTUNITIES FOR STUDENTS TO

01:01:15.405 --> 01:01:17.774
HAVE THAT INTERACTION.

01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:20.410
WITH FACULTY.

01:01:20.476 --> 01:01:23.146
MAYBE TO FOLLOW UP ON MISLI MON

01:01:23.212 --> 01:01:24.881
ON THE STUDENT EXPERIENCE I I

01:01:24.947 --> 01:01:25.882
FIND --

01:01:25.948 --> 01:01:29.385
SLIDE FOURTEEN VERY TROUBLING --

01:01:29.452 --> 01:01:31.020
AS THE THE DECLINE IN

01:01:31.087 --> 01:01:36.926
SATISFACTION FROM 200-062-2000 --

01:01:36.993 --> 01:01:38.895
SIXTEEN PARTICULARLY THE THE THE

01:01:38.961 --> 01:01:40.863
SECOND WHEN THEY'RE NOT BEING

01:01:40.930 --> 01:01:43.800
ABLE TO TO OF MAJOR IN THEIR

01:01:43.866 --> 01:01:49.005
FIRST CHOICE OF MAJOR. 13% --

01:01:49.072 --> 01:01:50.373
YOU KNOW I IT SEEMS LIKE TO ME

01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:52.775
THAT PEOPLE OF BEGIN COLLEGE

01:01:52.842 --> 01:01:54.110
WITH AN IDEA THAT THIS IS WHAT

01:01:54.177 --> 01:01:55.244
THEY WANT TO STUDY THIS IS WHAT

01:01:55.311 --> 01:01:56.879
THEY WANT TO GET THEIR DEGREE

01:01:56.946 --> 01:01:59.582
AND AND TO HAVE THAT HIGH OF A

01:01:59.649 --> 01:02:00.716
PERCENTAGE.

01:02:00.783 --> 01:02:04.053
OF STUDENTS NOT BEING ABLE --

01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:05.888
TO GET THE MAJOR THAT THEY WANT.

01:02:05.955 --> 01:02:07.523
IS IS A VERY TROUBLING I

01:02:07.590 --> 01:02:09.125
UNDERSTAND.

01:02:09.192 --> 01:02:09.892
THAT IS TIED TO FUNDING

01:02:09.959 --> 01:02:10.193
[inaudible]

01:02:10.259 --> 01:02:12.395
SO.

01:02:12.462 --> 01:02:13.429
NOW I HAVE TO GO TO A DIFFERENT

01:02:13.496 --> 01:02:15.898
MAJOR -- GET

01:02:15.965 --> 01:02:18.701
ON THEY GO FROM WHAT.

01:02:18.768 --> 01:02:20.002
IT --

01:02:20.069 --> 01:02:22.338
BIOLOGY.

01:02:22.405 --> 01:02:24.440
TO SOMETHING OUTSIDE IN A ANY

01:02:24.507 --> 01:02:26.342
ANY ANY INPUT THAT YOU CAN GIVE

01:02:26.409 --> 01:02:27.443
US.

01:02:27.510 --> 01:02:29.579
WE WE DON'T KNOW WE DON'T HAVE

01:02:29.645 --> 01:02:31.247
DATE ON WHICH MAJOR SONS

01:02:31.314 --> 01:02:33.316
ACTUALLY DO END UP SELECTING WE

01:02:33.382 --> 01:02:35.084
WOULD THINK OF PROBABLY WOULD BE

01:02:35.151 --> 01:02:39.021
A MAJOR RELATIVELY CLOSE TO WHAT.

01:02:39.088 --> 01:02:41.858
I WANT TO AND ORIGINALLY STUDY --

01:02:41.924 --> 01:02:42.992
BUT IT'S CERTAINLY LEADS TO

01:02:43.059 --> 01:02:44.660
PERSONAL FRUSTRATION THEY COME

01:02:44.727 --> 01:02:46.596
TO THE UNIVERSITY THEY THINK

01:02:46.662 --> 01:02:47.563
THEY'RE GOING TO BE.

01:02:47.630 --> 01:02:48.865
SOMETHING THEY HAVE THEIR OWN

01:02:48.931 --> 01:02:50.833
PERSONAL ASPIRATIONS AND THEN

01:02:50.900 --> 01:02:52.368
THEY GOT TOLD THERE'S NO ROOM

01:02:52.435 --> 01:02:56.172
FOR YOU AND WITHIN THIS MAJOR --

01:02:56.239 --> 01:02:59.909
AND PERHAPS THEY MOVE FROM --

01:02:59.976 --> 01:03:02.578
CHEMISTRY.

01:03:02.645 --> 01:03:04.780
TO PHYSICS OR BIOLOGY OR

01:03:04.847 --> 01:03:06.482
SOMETHING YOU KNOW I'VE I'M NOT

01:03:06.549 --> 01:03:08.184
CERTAIN WHAT THE COMPARABLE

01:03:08.251 --> 01:03:09.652
MAJOR WOULD BE IT WOULD BE AN

01:03:09.719 --> 01:03:11.554
ACADEMIC ADVISER WHO WOULD BE IN

01:03:11.621 --> 01:03:13.322
CHARGE OF HELPING THE STUDENTS

01:03:13.389 --> 01:03:14.891
IDENTIFIER DIFFERENT MAJOR.

01:03:14.957 --> 01:03:16.826
HOWEVER WE'RE SHORT ON ACADEMIC

01:03:16.893 --> 01:03:18.594
ADVISORS AND THE WAIT LIST IS

01:03:18.661 --> 01:03:20.329
VERY LONG SO SOME OF THE ACTUAL

01:03:20.396 --> 01:03:21.864
IMPACTS FOR THE STUDENT MAY BE

01:03:21.931 --> 01:03:23.266
THAT THEY TRY TO END UP.

01:03:23.332 --> 01:03:24.734
TAKING COURSES THAT THEY TEND

01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:26.669
DON'T NEED FOR THE MAJOR WHERE

01:03:26.736 --> 01:03:28.671
THEY ACTUALLY END UP THEY END UP

01:03:28.738 --> 01:03:30.039
TAKING MORE UNITS THAN THEY NEED

01:03:30.106 --> 01:03:32.008
TO STAND UP STAYING LONGER WITH

01:03:32.074 --> 01:03:32.708
THE UNIVERSITY.

01:03:32.775 --> 01:03:34.477
AND AS A RESULT THEY MAY BE

01:03:34.544 --> 01:03:37.914
TAKING ON MORE PERSONAL DEBT

01:03:37.980 --> 01:03:38.214
[inaudible]

01:03:38.281 --> 01:03:39.315
YEAH WELL.

01:03:39.382 --> 01:03:40.216
CERTAINLY --

01:03:40.283 --> 01:03:41.951
AS AS MISLI MON SAID YOU KNOW

01:03:42.018 --> 01:03:43.152
THE STUDENT EXPERIENCE I THINK

01:03:43.219 --> 01:03:45.521
IS PARAMOUNT.

HAVE TO TRACK THAT THE STUDENT

01:04:45.081 --> 01:04:47.083

01:07:09.792 --> 01:07:11.460
HOWEVER I AYE THIS DATA IS

01:07:11.527 --> 01:07:12.261
TELLING YOU SOMETHING AND I

01:07:17.967 --> 01:07:20.603
COULD I COULD FIX THESE PROBLEMS

01:07:20.669 --> 01:07:21.737
WE HAD TO TO REBOOT.

01:07:21.804 --> 01:07:23.472
HOW WE OPERATE A REBOOT HOW WE

01:07:23.539 --> 01:07:24.707
ADDRESSED OUR MISSION WITHOUT

01:07:24.774 --> 01:07:25.708
MORE DOLLARS OFTEN OFTEN IN

01:07:25.775 --> 01:07:27.243
TIMES OF DECLINING DOLLARS?

01:07:27.309 --> 01:07:29.011
SO I WOULD JUST HOPE YOU THE

01:07:29.078 --> 01:07:30.346
UNIVERSITY WOULD TAKE THAT BACK

01:07:30.413 --> 01:07:33.048
AND CONTEMPLATE THAT QUESTION

01:07:33.115 --> 01:07:33.315
THANK YOU.

01:07:33.382 --> 01:07:36.485
THANK YOU SIR [inaudible]

01:07:36.552 --> 01:07:38.788
OKAY.

01:07:38.854 --> 01:07:41.023
OUR FEW QUESTIONS HERE I WON I

01:07:41.090 --> 01:07:42.758
JUST WANT TO NOTE THAT ON THE

01:07:42.825 --> 01:07:45.394
ACT WE CAN MAKE THIS POINT EVERY

01:07:45.461 --> 01:07:45.928
EVERY YEAR OF US WHEN THE

01:07:45.995 --> 01:07:46.896
CLARIFY THAT.

01:07:46.962 --> 01:07:48.497
ON THE STATE FUNDING OVERALL

01:07:48.564 --> 01:07:50.666
SURE CALIFORNIA WE'RE NOT

01:07:50.733 --> 01:07:52.201
STEPPING UP TO FIND HIGHER ADD

01:07:52.268 --> 01:07:54.003
LIKE THE ONE WE SHOULD BE.

01:07:54.069 --> 01:07:56.071
OR TO LIKE WE DID --

01:07:56.138 --> 01:07:57.740
DECADES BEFORE I THINK IT IS

01:07:57.807 --> 01:07:59.074
IMPORTANT NOTE THAT IN ADDITION

01:07:59.141 --> 01:08:00.676
TO THE STATE GENERAL FUND THREE

01:08:00.743 --> 01:08:01.944
POINT SEVEN BILLION.

01:08:02.011 --> 01:08:04.180
OF THAT TUITION REVENUE --

01:08:04.246 --> 01:08:06.182
I BELIEVE OVER A BILLION A STATE

01:08:06.248 --> 01:08:07.917
MONEY THROUGH THE CALTRANS AND

01:08:07.983 --> 01:08:09.485
MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM.

01:08:09.552 --> 01:08:11.153
SO THAT IS MONEY FROM THE STATE

01:08:11.220 --> 01:08:13.823
OF CALIFORNIA THE UNIVERSITY

01:08:13.889 --> 01:08:15.257
SYSTEM SO I THINK THAT'S

01:08:15.324 --> 01:08:16.659
IMPORTANT TO NOTE --

01:08:16.725 --> 01:08:18.928
I WANTED --

01:08:18.994 --> 01:08:19.728
TO JUST MENTION.

01:08:19.795 --> 01:08:20.729
JUST --

01:08:20.796 --> 01:08:23.065
MAYBE ASK YOU OR REGION

01:08:23.132 --> 01:08:24.900
PRESIDENT KEY FOR BEHIND YOU.

01:08:24.967 --> 01:08:27.336
ON THE NON RESIDENT TUITION

01:08:27.403 --> 01:08:29.104
INCREASE AS MR DONALD SAID IT'S

01:08:29.171 --> 01:08:31.006
NON RESIDENT REGARDLESS OF OF IF

01:08:31.073 --> 01:08:33.075
YOU'RE INTERNATIONAL OR AT YOU

01:08:33.142 --> 01:08:34.243
KNOW WEALTHY OUT OF STATERS --

01:08:34.310 --> 01:08:36.111
I WENT TO THERE IS ONE ISSUE

01:08:36.178 --> 01:08:36.879
THAT CAME UP WITH THE REDUCE

01:08:36.946 --> 01:08:37.680
MEETING WITH US A LITTLE

01:08:37.746 --> 01:08:39.381
CONCERNING AND THAT'S THE THE

01:08:39.448 --> 01:08:41.250
STUDENTS THAT ARE UNDOCUMENTED

01:08:41.317 --> 01:08:42.218
THAT.

01:08:42.284 --> 01:08:44.587
AB FIVE FORTY KIDS WHO SOMEHOW.

01:08:44.653 --> 01:08:46.388
ARE JUST MISSING OUT SO I'M NOT

01:08:46.455 --> 01:08:47.957
SURE IF WHEN THEY TALK ABOUT

01:08:48.023 --> 01:08:49.391
THIS NOW BUT WE WE ARE

01:08:49.458 --> 01:08:52.127
INTERESTED IF IF THE UC WANTS.

01:08:52.194 --> 01:08:56.599
TO TALK WORK WITH US AND AND IF

01:08:56.665 --> 01:08:57.900
NEEDS TO BE SOME CLARIFICATION

01:08:57.967 --> 01:09:00.536
[inaudible] TO MAKE SOME OF

01:09:00.603 --> 01:09:02.171
THOSE KIDS WHO ARE SLIPPING

01:09:02.238 --> 01:09:03.339
THROUGH THE CRACKS AREN'T

01:09:03.405 --> 01:09:04.773
BECAUSE THAT CERTAINLY WAS IS

01:09:04.840 --> 01:09:06.675
NOT THE INTENT OF THE POLICY --

01:09:06.742 --> 01:09:08.110
SIR WE'RE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT

01:09:08.177 --> 01:09:09.945
ARE UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS WE DO

01:09:10.012 --> 01:09:10.813
HAVE -- SOME

01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:14.383
FINANCIAL AID PROGRAMS.

01:09:14.450 --> 01:09:16.852
FOR OF AT THE A LOAN PROGRAM FOR

01:09:16.919 --> 01:09:18.621
THOSE WHO DON'T QUALIFY THE FOR

01:09:18.687 --> 01:09:20.356
FOR THE AB FIVE FORTY WAIVER AND

01:09:20.422 --> 01:09:22.024
WE'D BE VERY HAPPY TO WORK WITH

01:09:22.091 --> 01:09:23.826
YOU TO TRY AND FIND SOLUTIONS.

01:09:23.893 --> 01:09:25.294
YOUR CORRECT THERE'S A GROUP OF

01:09:25.361 --> 01:09:26.896
STUDENTS WERE SLIPPING THROUGH

01:09:26.962 --> 01:09:28.097
THE CRACKS.

01:09:28.163 --> 01:09:29.965
OF THE DOCK A PROGRAM ADDRESSES

01:09:30.032 --> 01:09:31.400
ONLY THOSE STUDENTS WHO CAME

01:09:31.467 --> 01:09:33.769
HERE BEFORE THE AGE OF TWELVE

01:09:33.836 --> 01:09:35.571
AND THE AB FIVE FORTY PROGRAM

01:09:35.638 --> 01:09:37.473
COVERS ONLY THOSE WHO CRAFTED AT

01:09:37.540 --> 01:09:39.808
LEAST THREE YEARS OF CALIFORNIA

01:09:39.875 --> 01:09:40.309
HIGH SCHOOL.

01:09:40.376 --> 01:09:42.912
SO THERE'S A VERY SMALL BAND OF

01:09:42.978 --> 01:09:48.984
STUDENTS WHO CAME HERE AFTER --

01:09:49.051 --> 01:09:50.185
TWELVE BUT THE OR WHO CAME HERE

01:09:50.252 --> 01:09:50.786
AFTER THEY WERE OVER TWELVE

01:09:50.853 --> 01:09:52.655
YEARS OLD AND DID NOT COMPLETE

01:09:52.721 --> 01:09:53.522
THREE YEARS A CALIFORNIA HIGH

01:09:53.589 --> 01:09:54.189
SCHOOL.

01:09:54.256 --> 01:09:56.292
SO IF THEY COMPLETED THEIR

01:09:56.358 --> 01:09:57.860
JUNIOR AND SENIOR YEAR IN HIGH

01:09:57.927 --> 01:09:59.562
CALIFORNIA THEY WOULD NOT

01:09:59.628 --> 01:10:01.697
QUALIFY FOR THAT AB FIVE FORTY

01:10:01.764 --> 01:10:02.765
WAIVER YEAH WE CAN FOLLOW UP

01:10:02.831 --> 01:10:04.667
WITH THAT JUST WANT TO KNOW ONE

01:10:04.733 --> 01:10:06.502
THAT THE NUMBER.

01:10:06.569 --> 01:10:07.136
AND THE FOLLOW UP WITH IT WITH

01:10:07.202 --> 01:10:07.436
OUR STAFF.

01:10:07.503 --> 01:10:09.271
AND THEN TO WHAT POLICIES WE

01:10:09.338 --> 01:10:10.205
NEED TO ADDRESS BECAUSE

01:10:10.272 --> 01:10:12.708
CERTAINLY THAT'S NOT THE THE THE

01:10:12.775 --> 01:10:17.313
POPULATION WHERE WE'RE LOOKING --

01:10:17.379 --> 01:10:20.215
TO CUT OUT WITH THE NON READ NON

01:10:20.282 --> 01:10:22.384
RESIDENT --

01:10:22.451 --> 01:10:24.587
TUITION INCREASES --

01:10:24.653 --> 01:10:26.255
ARE SOMETHING THAT THE REGION'S

01:10:26.322 --> 01:10:28.090
SHOULD CONSIDER --

01:10:28.157 --> 01:10:29.658
I JUST I WANNA READ THE QUOTE

01:10:29.725 --> 01:10:30.793
FROM.

01:10:30.859 --> 01:10:32.661
THE PUBLICADO WHEN SHE TOLD THE

01:10:32.728 --> 01:10:34.196
REGION SAID THAT THIRTY MILLION.

01:10:34.263 --> 01:10:36.332
THAT WAS ON THE TABLE WOULD GO

01:10:36.398 --> 01:10:38.067
FOR AND ROLLING MORE.

01:10:38.133 --> 01:10:40.703
CALIFORNIA KIDS --

01:10:40.769 --> 01:10:42.237
INCREASED FINANCIAL AID HIRE

01:10:42.304 --> 01:10:43.606
MORE FACULTY AND STAFF AND

01:10:43.672 --> 01:10:44.974
TEACHING ASSISTANTS SO THOSE ARE

01:10:45.040 --> 01:10:47.610
ALL THINGS THAT. ONE ARE OUR

01:10:47.676 --> 01:10:48.644
PRIORITIES THAT WE JUST SPENT.

01:10:48.711 --> 01:10:51.313
YOUR SLIDESHOW TALKING ABOUT SO.

01:10:51.380 --> 01:10:52.848
IF THIS DOESN'T GO THROUGH.

01:10:52.915 --> 01:10:53.882
YOU KNOW WHERE IS A THIRTY

01:10:53.949 --> 01:10:55.017
MILLION COME FROM I KNOW THAT

01:10:55.084 --> 01:10:56.418
THE SOME OF THE REGION SAID THEY

01:10:56.485 --> 01:10:58.153
WANT TO COME AND ASK FOR MORE

01:10:58.220 --> 01:11:00.055
MONEY FROM THE LEGISLATURE WILL

01:11:00.122 --> 01:11:01.056
TWO THINGS.

01:11:01.123 --> 01:11:03.225
ONE THE MAY REVISED MAY NOT BE

01:11:03.292 --> 01:11:08.530
AS ROSY WAS A THIS BUDGET PUT

01:11:08.597 --> 01:11:09.164
EVERYTHING ON THE TABLE AS FAR

01:11:09.231 --> 01:11:10.599
THE JACK THE JANUARY BUDGET SO

01:11:10.666 --> 01:11:11.600
WE'RE NOT CERTAIN IF IT'S GOING

01:11:11.667 --> 01:11:13.235
TO BE EXTRA MONEY IN MAY PLUS

01:11:13.302 --> 01:11:14.603
THE ECONOMY ISN'T.

01:11:14.670 --> 01:11:15.838
LIKE IT WAS LAST COUPLE YEARS

01:11:15.904 --> 01:11:17.406
THAT BEING SAID IF THERE IS ANY

01:11:17.473 --> 01:11:19.441
ADDITIONAL MONEY OUR PRIORITY IS

01:11:19.508 --> 01:11:21.343
TO FOCUS ON ENROLLMENT GROWTH AS

01:11:21.410 --> 01:11:22.011
WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER THAT YOU

01:11:22.077 --> 01:11:22.878
SEE.

01:11:22.945 --> 01:11:25.314
ASKING FOR FORTY MILLION TO FUND

01:11:25.381 --> 01:11:26.882
THE TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED

01:11:26.949 --> 01:11:27.916
ADDITIONAL CALIFORNIA STUDENTS

01:11:27.983 --> 01:11:29.852
AND SO YOU KNOW THIS THIRTY

01:11:29.918 --> 01:11:32.988
MILLION I WOULD LEAVE A HOLE.

01:11:33.055 --> 01:11:33.522
FOR OTHER ISSUES THAT ARE

01:11:33.589 --> 01:11:35.924
IMPORTANT TO TO CALIFORNIA SO.

01:11:35.991 --> 01:11:38.027
I WANT TO KNOW THAT --

01:11:38.093 --> 01:11:40.929
AND THEN I I ALSO WANT TO ASK AS

01:11:40.996 --> 01:11:46.301
FAR AS THE THE UC'S PROJECTIONS

01:11:46.368 --> 01:11:48.837
FOR OVERALL IN ENROLLMENT SO.

01:11:48.904 --> 01:11:49.938
YOU KNOW WE WE KNOW WE'VE BEEN

01:11:50.005 --> 01:11:51.373
TRYING REALLY HARD LAST YEAR'S

01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:53.042
AND YOU SEE HAS STEPPED UP AND

01:11:53.108 --> 01:11:55.210
IN ROLLED ABOUT FIFTEEN THOUSAND

01:11:55.277 --> 01:11:56.879
NEW CALIFORNIANS IN THE LAST

01:11:56.945 --> 01:11:59.481
ROUGHLY FIVE YEARS --

01:11:59.548 --> 01:12:00.949
MAINLY WITH CALIFORNIA MONEY IN

01:12:01.016 --> 01:12:03.585
THE BUDGET BUT THE UC HAS OVER

01:12:03.652 --> 01:12:04.219
AND ROLLED.

01:12:04.286 --> 01:12:05.854
HIS AND OF THE ENROLLMENTS NOT

01:12:05.921 --> 01:12:09.224
NECESSARILY AT AT SCIENCE BUT

01:12:09.291 --> 01:12:11.994
AND ART AT THIS THAT'S IT WOULD

01:12:12.061 --> 01:12:12.261
YOU SAY --

01:12:12.327 --> 01:12:13.462
HERE AND THERE.

01:12:13.529 --> 01:12:17.533
BUT ON THE CHARTS.

01:12:17.599 --> 01:12:21.070
THAT ON THE ARCH AGENDA ITEM

01:12:21.136 --> 01:12:23.072
PAGE PAGE EIGHT FINE ART.

01:12:23.138 --> 01:12:27.142
NOT NOT YOUR CHART OUR AGENDA

01:12:27.209 --> 01:12:29.745
AND YEAH.

01:12:29.812 --> 01:12:33.115
THE GOAL IS TO GROW BY TWENTY

01:12:33.182 --> 01:12:34.883
FIVE HUNDRED A YEAR.

01:12:34.950 --> 01:12:35.451
THAT'S A WE'VE BEEN TALKING

01:12:35.517 --> 01:12:37.152
ABOUT WITH.

01:12:37.219 --> 01:12:39.822
THE PRESIDENT AND CHAIRMAN TING

01:12:39.888 --> 01:12:41.890
AND I AND AND OTHERS AND THE FOR

01:12:41.957 --> 01:12:43.258
THE FOUR YEAR GROWTH YOU HAVE

01:12:43.325 --> 01:12:44.860
HERE.

01:12:44.927 --> 01:12:46.361
IS IS.

01:12:46.428 --> 01:12:47.496
THREE THOUSAND TOTAL OVER FOUR

01:12:47.563 --> 01:12:48.230
YEARS SO.

01:12:48.297 --> 01:12:50.365
HOW DOES THAT?

01:12:50.432 --> 01:12:51.800
MATCH UPPER MORE POORLY IT

01:12:51.867 --> 01:12:53.502
DOESN'T MATCH UP.

01:12:53.569 --> 01:12:54.770
WE WENT TO GET TWENTY FIVE

01:12:54.837 --> 01:12:57.439
HUNDRED PER YEAR --

01:12:57.506 --> 01:12:59.641
SO SERVE ONE OF THE THINGS

01:12:59.708 --> 01:13:00.642
PULLING THIS --

01:13:00.709 --> 01:13:02.845
TAKING THESE NUMBERS --

01:13:02.911 --> 01:13:03.812
MAKING THEM LOOK A LITTLE

01:13:03.879 --> 01:13:06.648
STRANGE IS A UC IRVINE WHICH IS

01:13:06.715 --> 01:13:08.050
PROPOSING TO DECREASE ITS

01:13:08.117 --> 01:13:09.885
ENROLLMENT THEY ARE SO SEVERELY

01:13:09.952 --> 01:13:11.653
OVER AND ROLLED RIGHT NOW.

01:13:11.720 --> 01:13:14.056
THAT THE STATES JUST CANNOT A

01:13:14.123 --> 01:13:17.693
CALL GOING ON THEY HAVEN'T BEEN

01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:18.227
ABLE TO PROVIDE THEM WITH

01:13:18.293 --> 01:13:19.495
CLASSES.

01:13:19.561 --> 01:13:20.829
AND IT'S NOT --

01:13:20.896 --> 01:13:22.131
IT'S NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THEM TO

01:13:22.197 --> 01:13:24.666
CONTINUE. TO TO HAVE THAT MUCH

01:13:24.733 --> 01:13:25.701
ENROLLMENT SO THEY NEED TO DO

01:13:25.768 --> 01:13:26.702
BUT EVEN IF YOU TOOK OUT THE

01:13:26.769 --> 01:13:29.238
IRVINE I GET THAT GIVES STILL BE.

01:13:29.304 --> 01:13:31.907
MUCH GREATER IF YOU DID TWENTY

01:13:31.974 --> 01:13:33.675
FIVE HUNDRED PER YEAR.

01:13:33.742 --> 01:13:35.677
TIMES FOR YEARS.

01:13:35.744 --> 01:13:37.179
YOU'RE CORRECT THAT WOULD BE

01:13:37.246 --> 01:13:37.579
MORE --

01:13:37.646 --> 01:13:41.083
WE'RE NOW SEEKING --

01:13:41.150 --> 01:13:42.918
TO GROW OUR NUMBER OF DEGREES BY

01:13:42.985 --> 01:13:45.087
CLOSING DEGREE GAPS --

01:13:45.154 --> 01:13:47.256
AND POTENTIALLY BRINGING BACK

01:13:47.322 --> 01:13:49.458
STUDENTS WHO PREVIOUSLY DROPPED

01:13:49.525 --> 01:13:50.092
OUT WHO HAVE A HIGH NUMBER OF

01:13:50.159 --> 01:13:52.060
UNITS WE CAN GET TO GRADUATE

01:13:52.127 --> 01:13:53.929
WITH DEGREES SO WE WOULD STILL

01:13:53.996 --> 01:13:56.131
HAVE GREATER DEGREE PRODUCTION.

01:13:56.198 --> 01:13:57.599
BUT WE WOULD NOT NECESSARILY BE

01:13:57.666 --> 01:14:00.302
GROWING OUR TOTAL ENROLLMENT.

01:14:00.369 --> 01:14:02.471
AS MUCH AS BUT WE BUT WE WOULD

01:14:02.538 --> 01:14:04.306
STILL GROW IT BY OVER THREE

01:14:04.373 --> 01:14:05.808
HOUSE.

01:14:05.874 --> 01:14:08.610
OKAY AND THEN LASTLY ON THAT THE

01:14:08.677 --> 01:14:12.414
MARGINAL COST INCREASE.

01:14:12.481 --> 01:14:13.549
THAT THE TRADITIONAL NUMBER

01:14:13.615 --> 01:14:14.817
WE'VE.

01:14:14.883 --> 01:14:15.083
WE'VE --

01:14:15.150 --> 01:14:17.286
AGREED UPON AS TEN THOUSAND

01:14:17.352 --> 01:14:19.154
DOLLARS IN NET NON ESSAY AGREED

01:14:19.221 --> 01:14:20.455
UPON THAT THAT WAS A STATE.

01:14:20.522 --> 01:14:21.824
NUMBER BUT YOU SEE HAS

01:14:21.890 --> 01:14:23.792
CONTINUALLY DISAGREED ON THAT

01:14:23.859 --> 01:14:24.860
NUMBER IN THAT DEPARTMENT OF

01:14:24.927 --> 01:14:26.728
FINANCE PUSHED BACK OVER THE

01:14:26.795 --> 01:14:27.129
YEARS --

01:14:27.196 --> 01:14:31.066
REALLY HARD SO WHEN ASKED APART --

01:14:31.133 --> 01:14:34.069
COMMENTS ON THE REQUEST TO FIND

01:14:34.136 --> 01:14:37.606
STUDENTS AT THE ELEVEN THOUSAND

01:14:37.673 --> 01:14:39.274
AND SOME CHANGE OF ABOVE.

01:14:39.341 --> 01:14:43.011
AND DOES THIS DOES THE

01:14:43.078 --> 01:14:45.848
DOCUMENTATION WARRANT SUCH AN

01:14:45.914 --> 01:14:49.351
AND AN INCREASE AND IF NOT WHY --

01:14:49.418 --> 01:14:50.519
CHRIS FERGUSON WITH THE

01:14:50.586 --> 01:14:51.787
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I THINK

01:14:51.854 --> 01:14:54.256
WE'RE STILL LOOKING AT THEIR

01:14:54.323 --> 01:14:56.558
MARGINAL COST CALCULATION IT AND

01:14:56.625 --> 01:14:58.460
HAS THAT METHODOLOGY REMAIN THE

01:14:58.527 --> 01:15:00.696
SAME YEAR OVER YEAR OVER YEAR --

01:15:00.762 --> 01:15:02.531
BUT CERTAINLY AT THIS TIME --

01:15:02.598 --> 01:15:04.600
THE HIT THE PRACTICE THE THE

01:15:04.666 --> 01:15:06.068
PAST FEW YEARS HAS CERTAINLY

01:15:06.134 --> 01:15:09.204
BEEN TO A FUNDED ROMAN GROWTH AT

01:15:09.271 --> 01:15:10.005
TEN THOUSAND PER ADDITIONAL

01:15:10.072 --> 01:15:10.939
STUDENT.

01:15:11.006 --> 01:15:12.407
I'M MORE HAPPY TO LOOK AT WHAT

01:15:12.474 --> 01:15:14.176
YOU SEE IS PROVIDING --

01:15:14.243 --> 01:15:16.545
AND CERTAINLY YOU KNOW WE WOULD

01:15:16.612 --> 01:15:17.880
RETURN LATER --

01:15:17.946 --> 01:15:19.381
YOU IF WE WERE TO PROPOSE

01:15:19.448 --> 01:15:21.416
ENROLLMENT GROWTH WITH A AN

01:15:21.483 --> 01:15:25.053
AMOUNT THAT IS SOMEWHERE --

01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:25.320
EITHER --

01:15:25.387 --> 01:15:28.690
RIGHT YOU ARE IF WE DISAGREE

01:15:28.757 --> 01:15:30.158
WITH THE METHODOLOGY AT THAT TEN

01:15:30.225 --> 01:15:31.994
THOUSAND DOLLAR RATE.

01:15:32.060 --> 01:15:33.962
OKAY IT WOULD SEEM AT THE

01:15:34.029 --> 01:15:35.631
MINIMUM THERE SHOULD IT SHOULD

01:15:35.697 --> 01:15:36.865
BE A COLA.

01:15:36.932 --> 01:15:38.233
A WEEK WE HAVEN'T HAD ANY OF

01:15:38.300 --> 01:15:39.635
THAT SO YOU TO FOR DIDN'T AGREE

01:15:39.701 --> 01:15:41.470
ON THAT THE HIGHER NUMBER SOME

01:15:41.536 --> 01:15:42.871
TYPE OF A CALCULATION I KNOW.

01:15:42.938 --> 01:15:44.806
THAT WE HAD WE'VE HAD THAT IN

01:15:44.873 --> 01:15:45.807
OTHER.

01:15:45.874 --> 01:15:47.342
EDUCATION --

01:15:47.409 --> 01:15:48.744
MARKERS AS FAR AS THE MARGINAL

01:15:48.810 --> 01:15:50.612
COSTS CORRECT YES CERTAINLY

01:15:50.679 --> 01:15:52.814
HAPPY TO TO LOOK AT AT SOMETHING

01:15:52.881 --> 01:15:53.715
LIKE --

01:15:53.782 --> 01:15:55.284
APPLYING COLA --

01:15:55.350 --> 01:15:57.052
CERTAINLY HAPPY TO LOOK AT THAT

01:15:57.119 --> 01:15:58.954
AND WE HAVE GIVEN THE MARGINAL

01:15:59.021 --> 01:16:02.024
COST COLIN CREASE FOR CSU OVER

01:16:02.090 --> 01:16:02.791
THE YEARS CORRECT.

01:16:02.858 --> 01:16:04.426
YET CSU HAS A VERY SPECIFIC

01:16:04.493 --> 01:16:06.028
CALCULATION THAT LOOKS AT THE

01:16:06.094 --> 01:16:07.996
COST OF INSTRUCTION --

01:16:08.063 --> 01:16:09.731
AND THAT ACCOUNTS FOR AYE THOSE

01:16:09.798 --> 01:16:11.199
COSTS HAS THEY'RE CHANGING OVER

01:16:11.266 --> 01:16:12.467
TIME -- AND

01:16:12.534 --> 01:16:13.769
IT'S IT'S BEEN A CONSISTENT

01:16:13.835 --> 01:16:17.773
METHODOLOGY FROM CSU YEAR OVER

01:16:17.839 --> 01:16:19.775
YEAR OVER.

01:16:19.841 --> 01:16:21.610
OKAY THANK YOU DESERVE I JUST

01:16:21.677 --> 01:16:22.744
HAVE A LOT MORE YAK BROWN ON THE

01:16:22.811 --> 01:16:23.845
MARGINAL COST I MEAN I WE WE

01:16:23.912 --> 01:16:24.379
STILL HAVE SOME QUESTIONS

01:16:24.446 --> 01:16:24.713
ACTUALLY WAS.

01:16:24.780 --> 01:16:25.547
LOOKING AT THE YEAR OVER YEAR

01:16:25.614 --> 01:16:25.881
COMPARISON --

01:16:25.948 --> 01:16:27.449
DID THIS MORNING AND I I HAVE

01:16:27.516 --> 01:16:30.052
SOME COSTS ABOUT THE COST OF

01:16:30.118 --> 01:16:32.587
LIVING ADJUSTMENT THAT --

01:16:32.654 --> 01:16:33.488
WE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW TOO IS

01:16:33.555 --> 01:16:35.357
THAT THE MORE THE MARGINAL COST

01:16:35.424 --> 01:16:36.291
WORKERS AS IF THERE'S A TOTAL

01:16:36.358 --> 01:16:38.327
COST OF INSTRUCTION AND THEN

01:16:38.393 --> 01:16:38.927
THERE'S A STATE AND A STUDENT

01:16:38.994 --> 01:16:39.928
SHARE.

01:16:39.995 --> 01:16:41.763
AND THE STUDENTS HERE DEPENDS ON

01:16:41.830 --> 01:16:43.098
WHAT TO WHICH IT IS AND SO IF

01:16:43.165 --> 01:16:44.066
TUITION.

01:16:44.132 --> 01:16:46.668

THE TOTAL.

01:16:57.512 --> 01:16:58.780

DISTRICT NOT STATE WIDE

01:18:19.528 --> 01:18:21.663
NECESSARILY.

01:18:21.730 --> 01:18:23.432
IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE

01:18:23.498 --> 01:18:26.835
UNIVERSE A CALIFORNIA ALSO HAS A

01:18:26.902 --> 01:18:29.438

01:18:32.274 --> 01:18:36.111
THAT CORRECT.

01:18:36.178 --> 01:18:38.680

MAY BE.

01:18:43.151 --> 01:18:44.352
THEY MAY BE ABLE TO ANSWER THESE

01:18:44.419 --> 01:18:47.089
QUESTIONS MORE PRECISELY WOULD

YOU LIKE ME TO CALL THEM THE

01:18:47.722 --> 01:18:50.025

MICHAEL BROWN.

01:19:00.268 --> 01:19:02.604
SO YOUR QUESTION IS ABOUT THE

01:19:02.671 --> 01:19:04.506
ELIGIBILITY IN A LOCAL CONTEXT

01:19:04.573 --> 01:19:08.977
AND WE DO DEFINE PART OF OF THE

01:19:09.044 --> 01:19:11.546
ELIGIBILITY POOL BASED ON RANK

01:19:11.613 --> 01:19:13.181
IN THE LOCAL HIGH SCHOOL.

01:19:13.248 --> 01:19:15.617
AND SO THE TOP 9% --

01:19:15.684 --> 01:19:17.452
IS IS CONSIDERED AS PART OF

01:19:17.519 --> 01:19:20.122
DEFINING THE ELIGIBILITY.

01:19:20.188 --> 01:19:22.090
SO IT'S TAUGHT 9% OF EVERY

01:19:22.157 --> 01:19:23.325
SINGLE HIGH SCHOOL IN THE STATE

01:19:23.391 --> 01:19:25.527

01:19:32.501 --> 01:19:34.236
WITH THE MASTER PLAN --

01:19:34.302 --> 01:19:36.872
GOAL OF THAT THE AT THE HIGHEST

01:19:36.938 --> 01:19:38.673
TWELVE POINT 5% I SEEM TO TWELVE

01:19:38.740 --> 01:19:40.675
HI IS TWELVE POINT 5% IS IS A

01:19:40.742 --> 01:19:42.077
STATE WIDE.

01:19:42.144 --> 01:19:43.245
YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE IN THE TOP

01:19:43.311 --> 01:19:45.981
TWELVE POINT 5% STATE WIDE.

01:19:46.047 --> 01:19:47.149
THEN.

01:19:47.215 --> 01:19:48.150
IT'S A YEAR YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO

01:19:48.216 --> 01:19:49.584
BE OR THE GOAL IS THAT YOU'RE

01:19:49.651 --> 01:19:51.319
GUARANTEED A SPOT AT AT ONE OF

01:19:51.386 --> 01:19:52.354
AT LEAST ONE OF THE UNIVERSITY

01:19:52.420 --> 01:19:53.889
OF CALIFORNIA CAMPUS THAT'S

01:19:53.955 --> 01:19:54.990
EXACTLY RIGHT.

01:19:55.056 --> 01:19:56.224
ASSEMBLYMEMBER WE ARE WE ARE

01:19:56.291 --> 01:20:00.061
TRYING AND A HALF PERCENT AS

01:20:00.128 --> 01:20:01.830
BROADLY AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE THE

01:20:01.897 --> 01:20:04.666
GOAL IS TO BROADLY REPRESENT

01:20:04.733 --> 01:20:05.800
CALIFORNIANS IN THE UNIVERSITY

01:20:05.867 --> 01:20:06.801
OF CALIFORNIA.

01:20:06.868 --> 01:20:08.937
AND TO LOOK AT ALL OUR AND AS

01:20:09.004 --> 01:20:10.338
BROADER RANGE OF ACHIEVEMENT

01:20:10.405 --> 01:20:13.441
INDICATORS AS WE POSSIBLY CAN SO --

01:20:13.508 --> 01:20:15.277
AND WE KNOW THAT GRADES AND TEST

01:20:15.343 --> 01:20:16.678
SCORES ALONE.

01:20:16.745 --> 01:20:20.081
I DO NOT DEFINE A PERSON'S MERIT

01:20:20.148 --> 01:20:21.883
FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA --

01:20:21.950 --> 01:20:23.451
I DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO

01:20:23.518 --> 01:20:26.288
PERHAPS DISTINGUISH BETWEEN WHAT

01:20:26.354 --> 01:20:28.123
WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT AND HOW

01:20:28.190 --> 01:20:29.624
BROADLY WERE LOOKING AT IT.

01:20:29.691 --> 01:20:32.027
AND WHAT AND WHAT WE'RE ACTUALLY

01:20:32.093 --> 01:20:34.329
AND NEGOTIATE WITH THE STATE TO

01:20:34.396 --> 01:20:35.497
ENROLL AND THOSE ARE DIFFERENT

01:20:35.564 --> 01:20:39.434
SO -- AND SO --

01:20:39.501 --> 01:20:41.836
THAT -- THAT

01:20:41.903 --> 01:20:44.005
TOP TWELVE AND A HALF PERCENT --

01:20:44.072 --> 01:20:45.840
HOW MAY BE AN IMPORTANT GOAL FOR

01:20:45.907 --> 01:20:47.375
THIS BODY --

01:20:47.442 --> 01:20:50.045
BUT WE HAVE HEARD AND BELIEVE AT

01:20:50.111 --> 01:20:51.746
THAT THIS BODY WANTS US TO LOOK

01:20:51.813 --> 01:20:55.083
AS BROADLY ARE AT AT AT THE

01:20:55.150 --> 01:20:55.817
EXCELLENCE THAT STUDENTS MAY

01:20:55.884 --> 01:20:56.885
BRING.

01:20:56.952 --> 01:20:59.521
AS POSSIBLE ARE AND THAT --

01:20:59.588 --> 01:21:01.656
AND THAT ONCE WE DEFINE WHO IS

01:21:01.723 --> 01:21:06.094
THE TOP --

01:21:06.161 --> 01:21:08.196
THEN WE NEGOTIATE WITH THE STATE

01:21:08.263 --> 01:21:10.999
THEY'RE SEPARATE ISSUES.

01:21:11.066 --> 01:21:13.802
I MEAN I I I JUST ANY OF THAT

01:21:13.868 --> 01:21:17.405
THE THE 9% GOAL OUT OF EVERY.

01:21:17.472 --> 01:21:18.807
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOL IN THE STATE

01:21:18.873 --> 01:21:21.276
OF CALIFORNIA WAS --

01:21:21.343 --> 01:21:23.712
A A REACTION TO PROPOSITION TWO

01:21:23.778 --> 01:21:26.281
OR NINE TO TO TRY --

01:21:26.348 --> 01:21:28.917
TO INSURER --

01:21:28.984 --> 01:21:30.652
AT THAT DIVERSE COMMUNITIES --

01:21:30.719 --> 01:21:32.220
A THAT --

01:21:32.287 --> 01:21:33.722
STUDENTS FROM FROM ALL

01:21:33.788 --> 01:21:35.190
COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT SAID A

01:21:35.257 --> 01:21:36.224
CALIFORNIA HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY

01:21:36.291 --> 01:21:36.791
TO IT.

01:21:36.858 --> 01:21:38.260
IT'S IN THE UNIVERSITY OF

01:21:38.326 --> 01:21:39.761
CALIFORNIA IS THAT CORRECT --

01:21:39.828 --> 01:21:41.329
HAVE I THINK IT WAS PART OF THE

01:21:41.396 --> 01:21:44.933
MOTIVATOR OUR I THINK THE I AS

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:46.968
IS OFTEN THE CASE --

01:21:47.035 --> 01:21:49.004
ARE BECAUSE WE ARE ALWAYS

01:21:49.070 --> 01:21:51.339
LOOKING AT AND BY THE WAY I I

01:21:51.406 --> 01:21:53.108
COME AT THIS FROM MANY MANY

01:21:53.174 --> 01:21:55.277
ANGLES FOR YEARS ALSO CHAIRED

01:21:55.343 --> 01:21:57.946
BY THE BOARD OF ADMISSIONS AND

01:21:58.013 --> 01:22:00.649
RELATIONS ARM OF THE THE

01:22:00.715 --> 01:22:04.686
UNIVERSITY OF THE FINE

01:22:04.753 --> 01:22:04.986
[inaudible]

01:22:05.053 --> 01:22:10.058
OUR GOAL IS --

01:22:10.125 --> 01:22:12.327
TO TO REPRESENT AS BROADLY AS WE

01:22:12.394 --> 01:22:13.728
POSSIBLY CAN.

01:22:13.795 --> 01:22:16.031
PARTICULARLY GIVEN HOW SELECTIVE

01:22:16.097 --> 01:22:18.366
THE UNIVERSITY IS HOW FEW SPACES

01:22:18.433 --> 01:22:20.101
THERE ACTUALLY ARE GIVEN THE

01:22:20.168 --> 01:22:20.669
DEMAND.

01:22:20.735 --> 01:22:23.238
IS TO TO REPRESENT AS BROADLY AS

01:22:23.305 --> 01:22:25.173
WE CAN --

01:22:25.240 --> 01:22:27.442
THIS THIS STUDENTS OF OUR STATE

01:22:27.509 --> 01:22:30.345
AND TO LOOK AT AS MANY OF THE OF

01:22:30.412 --> 01:22:31.813
THE FACTORS THAT WOULD DEFINE

01:22:31.880 --> 01:22:33.515
THAT EXCELLENCE AS WE POSSIBLY

01:22:33.581 --> 01:22:35.984
CAN ONE OF THE BEST PREDICTORS

01:22:36.051 --> 01:22:37.285
OF A STUDENT'S PERFORMANCE AT

01:22:37.352 --> 01:22:38.853
THE UNIVERSITY.

01:22:38.920 --> 01:22:40.889
IS ACTUALLY THEIR GPA AND AND

01:22:40.955 --> 01:22:42.290
ACTUALLY AMONG THE BEST

01:22:42.357 --> 01:22:44.059
PREDICTORS IS HOW A STUDENT

01:22:44.125 --> 01:22:46.461
RANKS IN THEIR GPA.

01:22:46.528 --> 01:22:48.163
AND THEIR LOCAL HIGH SCHOOL THE

01:22:48.229 --> 01:22:49.698
REASON WHY THE LOCAL HIGH SCHOOL

01:22:49.764 --> 01:22:51.633
IS EXAMINED IS BECAUSE THAT'S

01:22:51.700 --> 01:22:53.168
THE EDUCATIONAL ACHIEVEMENT

01:22:53.234 --> 01:22:55.170
CONTEXT IN WHICH STUDENTS ARE

01:22:55.236 --> 01:22:56.204
PERFORMING.

01:22:56.271 --> 01:22:58.373
AND IT IS REASONABLE --

01:22:58.440 --> 01:22:59.741
TO LOOK AT HOW STUDENTS ARE

01:22:59.808 --> 01:23:04.012
FARING IN THEIR LOCAL CONTEXT --

01:23:04.079 --> 01:23:07.148
AGAINST THAT PARTICULAR CRITERIA

01:23:07.215 --> 01:23:08.116
SO I MEAN DO WITH THE THE REASON

01:23:08.183 --> 01:23:09.651
WHY I'M ASKING THESE QUESTIONS

01:23:09.718 --> 01:23:12.587
IS BECAUSE YOU KNOW I A FOR

01:23:12.654 --> 01:23:14.122
EXAMPLE I I WHICH IS.

01:23:14.189 --> 01:23:20.729
IT HAD A TALKING TO A A

01:23:20.795 --> 01:23:22.597
ACCORDING TO THE STUDENT TO HE

01:23:22.664 --> 01:23:23.631
HE SCORED.

01:23:23.698 --> 01:23:25.233
TO IN A TWENTY TWO HUNDRED ON

01:23:25.300 --> 01:23:27.402
THE ON THE OLD SAT BUT WAS NOT

01:23:27.469 --> 01:23:29.471
ABLE TO GAIN ADMISSION TO A

01:23:29.537 --> 01:23:30.905
SINGLE.

01:23:30.972 --> 01:23:32.907
UNIVERSE A CALIFORNIA CAMPUS ARE

01:23:32.974 --> 01:23:34.976
I I DON'T KNOW IF HE IF HE

01:23:35.043 --> 01:23:37.379
APPLIED. TO TO BE LESS IMPACTED

01:23:37.445 --> 01:23:41.616
CAMPUSES MAY MAYBE HE TO SUPPLY.

01:23:41.683 --> 01:23:42.517
TO TO TO THE IMPACT OF CAMPUSES

01:23:42.584 --> 01:23:45.186
BUT YOU KNOW JUST ANECDOTALLY I

01:23:45.253 --> 01:23:51.526
I HEAR SO MANY STORIES LIKE THIS --

01:23:51.593 --> 01:23:52.460
IS SO THAT YOU KNOW WAIT WAIT

01:23:52.527 --> 01:23:54.796
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO A YOU KNOW

01:23:54.863 --> 01:23:56.731
STUDENTS FROM A A HIGH ACHIEVING

01:23:56.798 --> 01:23:58.733
HIGH SCHOOL YOU KNOW.

01:23:58.800 --> 01:24:02.737
IF IF THEY'RE YOU KNOW CONCERNED

01:24:02.804 --> 01:24:04.372
THAT THERE ARE THERE ARE.

01:24:04.439 --> 01:24:05.874
IN A THEIR IT'S HARDER TO GET

01:24:05.940 --> 01:24:09.177
INTO THE UC CAMPUS OF THE CHOICE

01:24:09.244 --> 01:24:11.246
AT A HIGH ACHIEVING HIGH SCHOOL

01:24:11.312 --> 01:24:15.884
VERSES AT EIGHT LOWER ACHIEVING

01:24:44.646 --> 01:24:46.581
THOUSAND AND AND MOST CAMPUSES

01:24:46.648 --> 01:24:49.017

THERE'S ACTUALLY PHYSICAL

01:25:05.333 --> 01:25:06.935
LIMITATIONS IN TERMS OF THEIR

01:25:07.001 --> 01:25:08.169
ABILITY TO GROW.

01:25:08.236 --> 01:25:14.509
AND SO IF WE CAN ADDRESS THAT --

01:25:14.576 --> 01:25:16.478

ODD THEN THEN THEN WE QUE --

01:25:27.689 --> 01:25:29.724
BUT IT'S IT'S CREATING THOSE NEW

01:25:29.791 --> 01:25:31.192
SEATS IT'S FUNDING THOSE NEW

01:25:31.259 --> 01:25:32.527
SEATS --

01:25:32.594 --> 01:25:34.762
ENABLING SOME OF OUR CAMPUSES TO

01:25:34.829 --> 01:25:36.130
GROW THAT CAPACITY.

01:25:36.197 --> 01:25:37.899
UNDERSTAND THAT ON SOME OF OUR

01:25:37.966 --> 01:25:39.701
CAMPUSES THERE'S ACTUALLY.

01:25:39.767 --> 01:25:41.803
THERE'S AN IMPOSSIBILITY TO GROW

01:25:41.870 --> 01:25:43.571
ACTUALLY MORE SICK OKAY I MADE

01:25:43.638 --> 01:25:46.841

01:28:49.757 --> 01:28:51.893
SMALL INCREMENTAL GROWTH IN IN

01:28:51.959 --> 01:28:53.961

FULLY UNDERSTAND THE REASON THAT

01:31:30.818 --> 01:31:31.652
YOU'RE DOING THIS FOR THE MONEY

01:31:31.719 --> 01:31:33.955
SO IT'S NOT THAT'S THAT'S BEEN

01:31:34.021 --> 01:31:37.959
VERY CLEAR IN ALL THE TESTIMONY.

01:31:38.025 --> 01:31:41.863
HELLO THIS IS.

01:31:41.929 --> 01:31:44.365
YOU YOU WOULDN'T SAY THAT REALLY.

01:31:44.432 --> 01:31:45.666
I'VE GOT THAT'S THAT'S SO YOU'RE

01:31:45.733 --> 01:31:48.569
YOU'RE COUNTERING WHAT EVERY

01:31:48.636 --> 01:31:49.203
EVERYBODY ELSE AS WHEN THEY COME

01:31:49.270 --> 01:31:51.439
HERE SO.

01:31:51.505 --> 01:31:52.406
PLEASE THE LIMóN.

01:31:52.473 --> 01:31:54.342
WE ARE SAFE FROM AN FROM AN

01:31:54.408 --> 01:31:55.276
ACADEMIC POINT OF VIEW --

01:31:55.343 --> 01:31:56.010
THE VALUE OF INTERNATIONAL

01:31:56.077 --> 01:31:57.378
STUDENTS IS NOT JUST FOR THE

01:31:57.445 --> 01:32:00.514
MONEY SO THEN LET ME PUSH BACK

01:32:00.581 --> 01:32:02.450
ON THAT BECAUSE IN TWO THOUSAND

01:32:02.516 --> 01:32:02.950
EIGHT WHEN WHEN WAS THE

01:32:03.017 --> 01:32:05.119
UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA FOUND.

01:32:05.186 --> 01:32:06.988
AT EIGHTEEN SIXTY FIFTY SIXTY SO

01:32:07.054 --> 01:32:08.689
FOR THE FIRST. HUNDRED FIFTY

01:32:08.756 --> 01:32:09.624
YEARS OF EXISTENCE.

01:32:09.690 --> 01:32:11.359
BY PERCENT WAS ABOUT WHAT IT WAS

01:32:11.425 --> 01:32:13.060
SO.

01:32:13.127 --> 01:32:14.829
SO AFTER A HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS

01:32:14.896 --> 01:32:16.397
UNIVERSES CITED THERE IS VALUE

01:32:16.464 --> 01:32:19.200
INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS.

01:32:19.267 --> 01:32:23.204
I OUR OUR HI I I UNDERSTAND YOUR

01:32:23.271 --> 01:32:24.405
YOUR RATIONALE IN LOGIC DOES NOT

01:32:24.472 --> 01:32:27.341
IT'S NOT RATIONALE IS JUST IT'S

01:32:27.408 --> 01:32:29.010
IT'S JUST BEING HONEST RIGHT SO.

01:32:29.076 --> 01:32:30.344
THE UNIVERSITY FOUND VALUE

01:32:30.411 --> 01:32:31.445
INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS WHEN THEY

01:32:31.512 --> 01:32:33.080
COULD GO.

01:32:33.147 --> 01:32:35.049
RECOUP MONEY FROM.

01:32:35.116 --> 01:32:36.484
SO THERE WASN'T VALUE FOR THE

01:32:36.550 --> 01:32:38.319
FIRST HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS.

01:32:38.386 --> 01:32:39.420
WHEN I WAS WHEN I WAS AT

01:32:39.487 --> 01:32:41.722
BERKELEY WHICH WAS WASN'T THAT

01:32:41.789 --> 01:32:43.691
LONG AGO BUT WAS AWHILE AGO?

01:32:43.758 --> 01:32:44.325
IT'S 5%.

01:32:44.392 --> 01:32:45.359
YEAH THAT TRADITIONALLY HAVE

01:32:45.426 --> 01:32:46.727
BEEN THE NUMBER FOR NOT JUST

01:32:46.794 --> 01:32:48.262
INTERNATIONAL BUT OUT OF STATE

01:32:48.329 --> 01:32:50.331
AS WELL AS THE MEMBER TING AYE I

01:32:50.398 --> 01:32:50.932
THINK.

01:32:50.998 --> 01:32:52.500
IT IS TRUE.

01:32:52.566 --> 01:32:56.404
THAT THERE IS OUR ECONOMIC VALUE

01:32:56.470 --> 01:32:58.572
I'M NOT DENYING THAT I'M SAYING

01:32:58.639 --> 01:33:00.308
THAT'S NOT THE ONLY REASON WHY

01:33:00.374 --> 01:33:02.209
I'M NOT DISSING THAT'S THE BY

01:33:02.276 --> 01:33:04.178
FAR THE PRIMARY REASON.

01:33:04.245 --> 01:33:06.514
SO I THINK WHAT YOU SAY SOUNDS

01:33:06.580 --> 01:33:07.848
NICE RHETORICALLY.

01:33:07.915 --> 01:33:10.952
EARLY THAT IT DOESN'T JIVE WITH

01:33:11.018 --> 01:33:13.788
THE HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY.

01:33:13.854 --> 01:33:15.890
AND IT DOESN'T JIVE THAT ALL OF

01:33:15.957 --> 01:33:17.992
A SUDDEN ACADEMICALLY THERE WAS

01:33:18.059 --> 01:33:19.126
THIS -- LES

01:33:19.193 --> 01:33:20.227
PAUL THAT WENT ON THAT --

01:33:20.294 --> 01:33:21.796
WHILE WE REALLY NEED TO BECOME

01:33:21.862 --> 01:33:23.130
MORE INTERNATIONAL.

01:33:23.197 --> 01:33:24.699
I I I I APPRECIATE THAT YOU

01:33:24.765 --> 01:33:25.967
DON'T NEED TO HELP OKAY.

01:33:26.033 --> 01:33:27.935
YOU KNOW THE WHAT WHAT WHAT

01:33:28.002 --> 01:33:29.236
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS ON WE

01:33:29.303 --> 01:33:31.138
HEARD A RATIONALE.

01:33:31.205 --> 01:33:33.374
WE DON'T BUY IT.

01:33:33.441 --> 01:33:35.476
IT SOUNDS LIKE.

01:33:35.543 --> 01:33:36.110
GET -- IF IF

01:33:36.177 --> 01:33:38.679
IF THE END THE AMOUNT OF MONEY.

01:33:38.746 --> 01:33:39.914
THAT YOU COULD GET FROM

01:33:39.981 --> 01:33:42.216
INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS WENT DOWN.

01:33:42.283 --> 01:33:43.951
I WOULD I BELIEVE THAT YOU WOULD

01:33:44.018 --> 01:33:46.420
NOT FIND AS MUCH VALUE FROM THE

01:33:46.487 --> 01:33:47.488
I'LL JUST BE FRANK.

01:33:47.555 --> 01:33:50.224
SO THE QUESTION AGAIN IS I GO

01:33:50.291 --> 01:33:51.692
MISTER MCCARTY AND I NEGOTIATED

01:33:51.759 --> 01:33:53.327
THAT DEAL TO CAP IT 18% IN THE

01:33:53.394 --> 01:33:54.562
HOPE WAS REALLY.

01:33:54.628 --> 01:33:58.232
THAT WE WOULD SEE A FLAT OF OUT

01:33:58.299 --> 01:34:00.868
OF STATE INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS.

01:34:00.935 --> 01:34:02.737
BUT UNFORTUNATELY IT APPEARS

01:34:02.803 --> 01:34:04.605
THAT NOT ONLY HAS A NOT FLAT IT

01:34:04.672 --> 01:34:07.208
CONTINUES TO RISE.

01:34:07.274 --> 01:34:08.743
SO I THINK IT MADE THIS YEAR WE

01:34:08.809 --> 01:34:10.044
MAY HAVE TO GO BACK AND RE

01:34:10.111 --> 01:34:12.680
REVIEW WHETHER THAT 18% IS A

01:34:12.747 --> 01:34:14.682
JACK NUMBER OR NOT.

01:34:14.749 --> 01:34:16.784
SIR MOST OF OUR CAMPUSES HAVE

01:34:16.851 --> 01:34:19.553
STAYED BELOW THAT CAPITAL BY BUS

01:34:19.620 --> 01:34:20.688
TICKET DEALS ON RESIDENTS IS

01:34:20.755 --> 01:34:23.791
SLOWING DEFINITELY SLOWING DOWN.

01:34:23.858 --> 01:34:25.726
I ALSO DO WANT --

01:34:25.793 --> 01:34:27.762
TO OFFERED THAT THE REASON THE

01:34:27.828 --> 01:34:29.196
NON RESIDENT ENROLLMENT

01:34:29.263 --> 01:34:31.399
INCREASED SO DRAMATICALLY WAS DE.

01:34:31.465 --> 01:34:33.634
UNPRECEDENTED ECONOMIC CRISIS

01:34:33.701 --> 01:34:35.503
THE STATE FACED --

01:34:35.569 --> 01:34:36.871
BACK WHERE WE WENT BACK WHEN YOU

01:34:36.937 --> 01:34:38.239
WERE AN UNDERGRADUATE AT UC

01:34:38.305 --> 01:34:40.174
BERKELEY AND IT WAS RANKED THIRD

01:34:40.241 --> 01:34:41.175
IN THE WORLD.

01:34:41.242 --> 01:34:43.144
NOT AMONG PUBLIX BUT AMONG ALL

01:34:43.210 --> 01:34:44.512
UNIVERSITIES THE STATE WAS

01:34:44.578 --> 01:34:46.747
FUNDING 70% OF THE INSTRUCTIONAL

01:34:46.814 --> 01:34:47.715
COSTS THERE.

01:34:47.782 --> 01:34:49.683
NOW THE STATE FUNDS 40% AND

01:34:49.750 --> 01:34:52.720
BERKELEY'S RANKING BUT FIFTEENTH.

01:34:52.787 --> 01:34:54.455
OF WHAT ARE SOME OF THE PUBLIC'S

01:34:54.522 --> 01:34:59.260
NO WE'RE NOT ARGUING WHETHER OR

01:34:59.326 --> 01:35:01.896
NOT FIND IT LIKE AGAIN.

01:35:01.962 --> 01:35:02.496
WE LOOK --

01:35:02.563 --> 01:35:04.331
IN A PROPOSED BROWN.

01:35:04.398 --> 01:35:04.999
IS GIVING.

01:35:05.066 --> 01:35:06.567
AN AN ARGUMENT THAT TO ME IN

01:35:06.634 --> 01:35:10.438
BUDGET COMMITTEE WHY THE REASON

01:35:10.504 --> 01:35:11.205
THIS IS A CAR.

01:35:11.272 --> 01:35:11.806
AND SO WE DON'T DISAGREE WITH

01:35:11.872 --> 01:35:13.007
YOU.

01:35:13.074 --> 01:35:14.241
WE TOTALLY AGREE WITH YOU IN

01:35:14.308 --> 01:35:15.743
FACT YOU LEAD WITH WE GET ONE

01:35:15.810 --> 01:35:17.845
POINT SOMETHING BILLION DOLLARS

01:35:17.912 --> 01:35:18.479
FROM THE INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS

01:35:18.546 --> 01:35:19.080
TO WASN'T HEY.

01:35:19.146 --> 01:35:20.848
WE'RE GETTING OUR RANKINGS

01:35:20.915 --> 01:35:23.284
HIGHER BECAUSE INTERNATIONAL

01:35:23.350 --> 01:35:24.285
STUDENTS SHE DID SAY THAT DISH

01:35:24.351 --> 01:35:24.585
[inaudible]

01:35:24.652 --> 01:35:25.953
SO AGAIN.

01:35:26.020 --> 01:35:27.721
WE NEGOTIATE THIS AGREEMENT THE

01:35:27.788 --> 01:35:29.390
HOPE WAS THAT THERE WOULD BE A

01:35:29.457 --> 01:35:31.992
FLATTENING OF OUT OF STATE

01:35:32.059 --> 01:35:33.561
INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS SO THAT

01:35:33.627 --> 01:35:35.763
CONSTITUENTS FIRM MISTER MERCER

01:35:35.830 --> 01:35:37.598
CHEESE HIGH SCHOOL COULD.

01:35:37.665 --> 01:35:39.900
GET THERE --

01:35:39.967 --> 01:35:41.035
TO YOU SEE.

01:35:41.102 --> 01:35:42.570
BECAUSE THAT GOES WITH THE SLOTS

01:35:42.636 --> 01:35:45.039
THAT THOSE SLOTS ARE BEING TAKEN

01:35:45.106 --> 01:35:45.973
UP.

01:35:46.040 --> 01:35:46.607
SO IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE MAY

01:35:46.674 --> 01:35:49.043
HAVE TO RE DISCUSS GOING IN TO

01:35:49.110 --> 01:35:50.244
THIS YEAR BECAUSE THE HOPE WAS

01:35:50.311 --> 01:35:51.479
THAT HE WAS GOING.

01:35:51.545 --> 01:35:52.880
TO FLATTEN BUT THE FACT THAT IT

01:35:52.947 --> 01:36:01.589
KEEPS GOING UP IS VERY TROUBLING.

01:36:01.655 --> 01:36:03.057
MURATSUCHI YES THANK IF I JUST

01:36:03.124 --> 01:36:04.658
QUICKLY FOLLOW UP ON THAT --

01:36:04.725 --> 01:36:05.326
MADE.

01:36:05.392 --> 01:36:09.396
OF ALONG THE SAME LINES IS --

01:36:09.463 --> 01:36:10.464
CHAIRMAN KINGS --

01:36:10.531 --> 01:36:11.966
GUIDE COMMENTS ME LOOKING AT THE

01:36:12.032 --> 01:36:13.634
THE SLIDE ON PAGE.

01:36:13.701 --> 01:36:15.136
ELEVEN I MEAN I I I KNOW WE WE

01:36:15.202 --> 01:36:16.470
CAN SPEAK FROM --

01:36:16.537 --> 01:36:18.005
FOR FROM OUR PERSONAL EXPERIENCE

01:36:18.072 --> 01:36:21.876
THAT -- FROM.

01:36:21.942 --> 01:36:24.745
201-322-22018 WELL THAT'S THE

01:36:24.812 --> 01:36:28.983
FOR NINETEEN BUDGETS --

01:36:29.049 --> 01:36:31.919
WE HAVE INCREASED --

01:36:31.986 --> 01:36:34.688
STATE GENERAL FUNDING FOR A OF

01:36:34.755 --> 01:36:36.657
FOR THE UC'S AND YET THE

01:36:36.724 --> 01:36:38.592
PERCENTAGE OF THE NON RESIDENTS

01:36:38.659 --> 01:36:40.694
COULDN'T HAVE CONTINUED TO GROW.

01:36:40.761 --> 01:36:41.695
SO THAT.

01:36:41.762 --> 01:36:43.764
SEEMS TO UNDERMINE YOUR ARGUMENT

01:36:43.831 --> 01:36:45.566
LIKE THE ARGUMENT THAT'S THAT'S

01:36:45.633 --> 01:36:47.201
THAT WE HEAR MOST --

01:36:47.268 --> 01:36:48.536
OFTEN THAT.

01:36:48.602 --> 01:36:50.271
THAT YOU'RE HAVING TO ADMIT MORE

01:36:50.337 --> 01:36:52.706
NON RESIDENT STUDENTS BECAUSE

01:36:52.773 --> 01:36:54.942
THE STATE --

01:36:55.009 --> 01:36:56.177
IS IS IS IS --

01:36:56.243 --> 01:36:58.445
IN THE STATE CONTRIBUTION TO

01:36:58.512 --> 01:37:01.348
YOUR CORE FUNDS ARE DECLINING.

01:37:01.415 --> 01:37:03.918
COULD YOU RESPOND TO THAT.

01:37:03.984 --> 01:37:07.121
DURING DURING THE BUDGET CRISIS --

01:37:07.188 --> 01:37:09.156
AND I I TALK ABOUT FOR TWENTY

01:37:09.223 --> 01:37:11.225
THIRTEEN ON YES WE LOST SO MUCH

01:37:11.292 --> 01:37:12.893
MONEY THAT WE'VE BEEN BUT ALSO

01:37:12.960 --> 01:37:14.995
WHEN WE HAD TO LAY OFF A LOT OF

01:37:15.062 --> 01:37:16.730
PEOPLE AND NOW WE'RE SER

01:37:16.797 --> 01:37:19.767
CATCHING UP AND IS FUNDS ARE

01:37:19.833 --> 01:37:22.870
REQUIRED FOR THAT.

01:37:22.937 --> 01:37:23.837
AND AND AND AND OUR TOTAL

01:37:23.904 --> 01:37:24.872
ENROLLMENT KEEPS GROWING SO THE

01:37:24.939 --> 01:37:26.440
NUMBERS THE HEAD COUNT OF

01:37:26.507 --> 01:37:28.475
RESIDENTS HAS BEEN AND THE F. T.

01:37:28.542 --> 01:37:30.044
OF RESIDENTS HAS BEEN GROWING

01:37:30.110 --> 01:37:32.413
DURING THAT TIME.

01:37:32.479 --> 01:37:34.548
SO WE ARE LEADING IN. FOR

01:37:34.615 --> 01:37:36.183
CALIFORNIA STUDENTS.

01:37:36.250 --> 01:37:38.485
YEAH YOU KNOW I I I I I KNOW

01:37:38.552 --> 01:37:40.187
THAT'S THE THE THE ARGUMENT THAT

01:37:40.254 --> 01:37:44.291
THAT WE THAT THE ALWAYS MAKE.

01:37:44.358 --> 01:37:45.926
REGISTER AYE AYE AYE BUT

01:37:45.993 --> 01:37:47.695
SPEAKING FOR MYSELF PERSONALLY I

01:37:47.761 --> 01:37:50.898
I HAVE A HARD TIME TRYING.

01:37:50.965 --> 01:37:52.700
TO KEEP TRACK I FEEL LIKE YOU

01:37:52.766 --> 01:37:54.501

01:37:54.568 --> 01:37:55.336
YOU KNOW THERE THERE ARE THERE

01:37:55.402 --> 01:37:57.738
ARE SO MANY MOVING PIECES HERE

01:37:57.805 --> 01:37:59.807
THAT -- THAT --

01:37:59.873 --> 01:38:01.375
YOU KNOW WERE E. A. B. WE ALWAYS

01:38:01.442 --> 01:38:02.910
COME BACK TO THAT ARGUMENT THAT

01:38:02.977 --> 01:38:04.011
THAT OF THE UNIVERSITY

01:38:04.078 --> 01:38:05.412
CALIFORNIA MAKES THAT.

01:38:05.479 --> 01:38:07.114
THAT YOU'RE HAVING TO ADMIT MORE

01:38:07.181 --> 01:38:09.783
OUT OF STATES TO BEING YOU

01:38:09.850 --> 01:38:11.418
ENOUGH MONEY AND SO THEREFORE

01:38:11.485 --> 01:38:13.120
IT'S SOMEHOW IT'S OUR FAULT.

01:38:13.187 --> 01:38:14.021
YOU KNOW --

01:38:14.088 --> 01:38:16.056
YOU KNOW WITH IT Y. WE'RE NOT

01:38:16.123 --> 01:38:17.324
ADMITTING --

01:38:17.391 --> 01:38:18.259
TO MORE MORE CALIFORNIA

THE VALUE OF DIVERSITY IN THE

01:38:25.032 --> 01:38:26.367
VALUE OF OUT OF STATE STUDENTS

01:38:26.433 --> 01:38:27.635
IN THE VALUE OF OF OF

01:38:52.293 --> 01:38:53.894
ICE MORE VALUE ON CALIFORNIA

01:38:53.961 --> 01:38:56.330
RESIDENTSTHAN WE DO ON THE

01:38:56.397 --> 01:38:58.732
BENEFITS OF DIVERSITY OF OUT OF

01:38:58.799 --> 01:39:01.769
STATE IN INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS.

OKAY FOLLOW UP FOR MR TING AND

01:39:05.205 --> 01:39:05.739
THEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER LIMóN AND

01:39:05.806 --> 01:39:06.874
THEY WANT TO GET TO THE NEXT

01:39:06.940 --> 01:39:08.475
ISSUE ITEMS SO WHAT FUNDING

01:39:08.542 --> 01:39:09.743
LEVEL WOULD.

01:39:09.810 --> 01:39:13.447
WHAT FUNDING LEVEL WHAT IT TAKES?

01:39:13.514 --> 01:39:15.783
TO ON FLATTEN NON RESIDENT

01:39:15.849 --> 01:39:19.853
STUDENT ENROLLMENT --

01:39:19.920 --> 01:39:21.355
I'VE NEVER SEEN THAT ONE I'LL

01:39:21.422 --> 01:39:22.890
HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT

01:39:22.956 --> 01:39:24.958
BECAUSE WILL HAVE TO ACCOUNT FOR

01:39:25.025 --> 01:39:26.593
FUTURE YEAR INFLATION SET LOOK

01:39:26.660 --> 01:39:28.362
IN THE INTERJECT LAST YEAR IN

01:39:28.429 --> 01:39:30.531
OUR FINAL BUDGET WE PUT LANGUAGE

01:39:30.597 --> 01:39:31.465
IN THE BUDGET.

01:39:31.532 --> 01:39:34.368
ASKING US TO GO DOWN 210%.

01:39:34.435 --> 01:39:35.002
WHICH WOULD.

01:39:35.069 --> 01:39:39.440
BE I AM OPTIMISTIC BUT ONE THAT

01:39:39.506 --> 01:39:40.874
WE THINK WE WOULD EMBRACE AND I

01:39:40.941 --> 01:39:42.109
THINK IN THAT WE ASK FOR AN

01:39:42.176 --> 01:39:45.312
APRIL ONE REPORT FROM THE UC TO

01:39:45.379 --> 01:39:47.247
US AND SO IS HIGHER THAN THAT

01:39:47.314 --> 01:39:48.515
IT IS NOW OKAY ARE COMING IN THE

01:39:48.582 --> 01:39:51.051
LAST STAGES OF REVIEW I BELIEVE

01:39:51.118 --> 01:39:51.685
SO.

01:39:51.752 --> 01:39:53.587
SOCIAL WHAT VERY WIDE MY CONCERN

01:39:53.654 --> 01:39:55.322
REGARDING THE OUT OF STATE

01:39:55.389 --> 01:39:56.223
EMPLOYMENT ALSO IS.

01:39:56.290 --> 01:39:58.392
THAT THERE'S REALLY NO INCENTIVE

01:39:58.459 --> 01:40:00.294
PUT IN PLACE FOR ANY OF THE

01:40:00.361 --> 01:40:03.697
CAMPUSES TO REDUCE ANY OF THE

01:40:03.764 --> 01:40:04.832
OUT OF STATE A WOMAN BECAUSE

01:40:04.898 --> 01:40:06.300
IT'S FRANKLY ONE OF THE ONLY

01:40:06.367 --> 01:40:08.969
DISCRETIONARY POTS OF MONEY THAT

01:40:09.036 --> 01:40:10.604
THE CHANCELLOR HAS AT THEIR

01:40:10.671 --> 01:40:11.839
CAMPUS.

01:40:11.905 --> 01:40:13.140
IF I WITH PARTICULAR CHANCELLOR.

01:40:13.207 --> 01:40:15.743
DISCRETIONARY MONEY AS WE ALL

01:40:15.809 --> 01:40:17.644
KNOW IS INVALUABLE.

01:40:17.711 --> 01:40:19.546
SO I WOULD BE CURIOUS AS TO WHAT

01:40:19.613 --> 01:40:22.049
POLICIES THE REGENTS OR THE

01:40:22.116 --> 01:40:23.917
OFFICE PRESENT ARE PUT IN PLACE

01:40:23.984 --> 01:40:25.386
TO CREATE --

01:40:25.452 --> 01:40:27.554
OF INCENTIVES TO MOVE TOWARD IN

01:40:27.621 --> 01:40:28.789
STATE AND WALNUT OR

01:40:28.856 --> 01:40:30.224
DISINCENTIVES.

01:40:30.290 --> 01:40:37.598
TO CONTINUE TO BE RELIANT ON OUT

01:40:37.664 --> 01:40:38.932
OF STATE AND ROMAN.

01:40:38.999 --> 01:40:39.933
JUST A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:40.234
FOR THAT --

01:40:40.300 --> 01:40:41.402
CURRENTLY THE WAY THE STATE

01:40:41.468 --> 01:40:42.169
FUNDS GET DISTRIBUTED IT IS AN

01:40:42.236 --> 01:40:43.704
EQUAL AMOUNT FOR EACH CAMPUS

01:40:43.771 --> 01:40:45.506
REGARDLESS OF COST OF LIVING OR

01:40:45.572 --> 01:40:48.142
ANYTHING ON THOSE.

01:40:48.208 --> 01:40:49.543
THAT THEY GET PER STUDENT IN

01:40:49.610 --> 01:40:51.879
STATE FUNDING THAT CAME ABOUT AS

01:40:51.945 --> 01:40:55.115
A RESULT OF I BELIEVE A TWENTY

01:40:55.182 --> 01:40:55.749
TWO THOUSAND EIGHT STATE AUDITOR

01:40:55.816 --> 01:40:57.618
REPORT TO CRITICIZE YOU SEE FOR

01:40:57.684 --> 01:41:00.954
GIVING DIFFERENTIAL DOLLARS PER

01:41:01.021 --> 01:41:02.122
STUDENT AT OUR CAMPUSES.

01:41:02.189 --> 01:41:03.824
SO NOW THE STATE FUNDS ARE

01:41:03.891 --> 01:41:06.727
PROVIDED ACROSS THE BOARD

01:41:06.794 --> 01:41:08.028
EQUALLY EVERYTHING.

01:41:08.095 --> 01:41:09.096
THE SO SO BERKELEY SAN DIEGO

01:41:09.163 --> 01:41:10.631
UCLA THE THREE MOST DESIRABLE

01:41:10.697 --> 01:41:15.502
CAMPUSES IT MADE THE MOST OUT OF

01:41:15.569 --> 01:41:15.903
STATE STUDENTS.

01:41:15.969 --> 01:41:16.403
SO THEY HAVE THE HIGHEST

01:41:16.470 --> 01:41:18.572
INCENTIVE. TO MAINTAIN THAT

01:41:18.639 --> 01:41:20.507
LEVEL OF ENROLLMENT.

01:41:20.574 --> 01:41:22.042
THAT IS THAT TRUE.

01:41:22.109 --> 01:41:23.143
THEY ALSO HAVE SOME OF THIS

01:41:23.210 --> 01:41:25.979
HIGHEST COSTS SO A FACULTY

01:41:26.046 --> 01:41:28.215
MEMBER --

01:41:28.282 --> 01:41:30.517
THE FACULTY THE SOME OF THE FACT

01:41:30.584 --> 01:41:32.286
THAT WE WANT TO LOOK REPORT

01:41:32.352 --> 01:41:33.620
COSTS BY JUST SAYING SO.

01:41:33.687 --> 01:41:34.721
SO THOSE ARE THE THREE MOST

01:41:34.788 --> 01:41:36.957
DESIRABLE CAMPUSES.

01:41:37.024 --> 01:41:38.792
THE TAKING THAT THE HIGHEST

01:41:38.859 --> 01:41:40.194
PERCENTAGE OF OUT OF STATE

01:41:40.260 --> 01:41:42.629
ENROLLMENT I THINK BELIEVE

01:41:42.696 --> 01:41:44.531
22224% -- IS

01:41:44.598 --> 01:41:47.734
SO THAT IS IN DIRECT COMPETITION

01:41:47.801 --> 01:41:49.036
TO CALIFORNIA STUDENTS WERE

01:41:49.102 --> 01:41:50.671
TRYING TO GET INTO THE THREE

01:41:50.737 --> 01:41:52.339
MOST DESIRABLE.

01:41:52.406 --> 01:41:54.341
CAMPUS AS WELL BECAUSE EACH

01:41:54.408 --> 01:41:55.976
CAMPUS MAKES A LITTLE BIT OF

01:41:56.043 --> 01:41:57.377
EXTRA MONEY FROM THE NON

01:41:57.444 --> 01:41:58.946
RESIDENT THEY CAN USE THOSE

01:41:59.012 --> 01:42:00.581
FUNDS TO ACTUALLY HIGHER

01:42:00.647 --> 01:42:02.850
LECTURERS OR FACULTY TO TEACH

01:42:02.916 --> 01:42:04.218
RESIDENTS STUDENTS AND IF WE

01:42:04.284 --> 01:42:06.453
LOST THAT ADDITIONAL REVENUE.

01:42:06.520 --> 01:42:08.388
WE WOULD ACTUALLY HAVE TO REDUCE

01:42:08.455 --> 01:42:09.356
THE NUMBER OF COURSES AND

01:42:09.423 --> 01:42:11.024
SERVICES PROVIDED THE RESIDENT

01:42:11.091 --> 01:42:13.160
STUDENTS SO IT'S A BIT OF A

01:42:13.227 --> 01:42:14.361
TANGLED ISSUE.

01:42:14.428 --> 01:42:16.129
IN THAT IT'S NOT JUST A MATTER

01:42:16.196 --> 01:42:17.931
OF THERE'S A PERSON SITTING IN A

01:42:17.998 --> 01:42:19.233
CHAIR BUT THAT PERSON IS

01:42:19.299 --> 01:42:22.002
ACTUALLY FINANCING DEAL ABILITY

01:42:22.069 --> 01:42:22.803
I DON'T.

01:42:22.870 --> 01:42:23.437
COMPLICATED ISSUE AS YOU MAKE A

01:42:23.504 --> 01:42:24.605
SOUND I THINK IT REALLY COMES

01:42:24.671 --> 01:42:25.606
DOWN.

01:42:25.672 --> 01:42:27.174
TO YOU KNOW AYE CHANCELLOR NEEDS

01:42:27.241 --> 01:42:29.009
TO BALANCE THEIR BUDGET AND THIS

01:42:29.076 --> 01:42:30.944
IS THIS IS THE WAY THEY BALLOTS

01:42:31.011 --> 01:42:32.546
I THINK THAT'S WHAT IT COMES

01:42:32.613 --> 01:42:33.447
DOWN TO SO I THINK A BALANCE IT.

01:42:33.514 --> 01:42:36.416
ANOTHER WAY THAT MAYBE THEY

01:42:36.483 --> 01:42:39.186
WOULD CONSIDER AT THAT THIS OUR

01:42:39.253 --> 01:42:40.787
OUR UNIVERSITIES HAVE VERY.

01:42:40.854 --> 01:42:44.024
VERY FEW LEVERS FOR FUNDING

01:42:44.091 --> 01:42:47.094
GREAT EXAMPLE YEAH.

01:42:47.160 --> 01:42:48.128
THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER LIMA

01:42:48.195 --> 01:42:49.930
THANK YOU I I APPRECIATE THE

01:42:49.997 --> 01:42:51.398
DISCUSSION AND I THINK THAT THIS

01:42:51.465 --> 01:42:53.367
IS ACTUALLY HIGHLIGHTING ONE OF

01:42:53.433 --> 01:42:55.235
THE GREATER COMPLEXITIES --

01:42:55.302 --> 01:42:57.337
OF THIS I MEAN IN THIS IN THIS

01:42:57.404 --> 01:42:58.705
LAST I THINK TWENTY MINUTES OF

01:42:58.772 --> 01:42:59.773
DISCUSSION --

01:42:59.840 --> 01:43:00.874
BETWEEN --

01:43:00.941 --> 01:43:03.176
THE MEMBERS AND YOU SEE

01:43:03.243 --> 01:43:04.177
REPRESENTATIVES.

01:43:04.244 --> 01:43:05.112
YOU KNOW.

01:43:05.178 --> 01:43:06.780
I I'VE HEARD THAT TO SOME EXTENT

01:43:06.847 --> 01:43:08.782
SOME OF THE OBJECTIVES THAT THE

01:43:08.849 --> 01:43:10.717
LEGISLATURE HAD WERE MET --

01:43:10.784 --> 01:43:13.353
WHICH WAS TO INCREASE TO ADD IS

01:43:13.420 --> 01:43:14.588
THAT IN STATE --

01:43:14.655 --> 01:43:15.856
STUDENT ENROLLMENT THAT THAT'S

01:43:15.923 --> 01:43:17.558
AN OBJECTIVE THAT HAS BEEN MET

01:43:17.624 --> 01:43:19.393
THAT IS A PRIORITY TO US --

01:43:19.459 --> 01:43:20.460
I KNOW THAT ONE OF THE

01:43:20.527 --> 01:43:24.231
OBJECTIVES WE'VE HAD --

01:43:24.298 --> 01:43:25.365
HAS ALSO BEEN.

01:43:25.432 --> 01:43:26.667
TO KEEP AND MAINTAIN THE COST OF

01:43:26.733 --> 01:43:28.468
TUITION FROM GOING UP AND THAT

01:43:28.535 --> 01:43:30.070
HAS BEEN MET --

01:43:30.137 --> 01:43:31.605
AND YOU KNOW I I STRUGGLE WITH

01:43:31.672 --> 01:43:34.274
WHAT THE RIGHT IS.

01:43:34.341 --> 01:43:37.544
BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THAT THERE

01:43:37.611 --> 01:43:39.413
IS ANY AS AS AN ASSEMBLYMEMBER

01:43:39.479 --> 01:43:40.881
SUIT SHE SAID THERE THERE IS ANY

01:43:40.948 --> 01:43:43.550
DEBATE ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE THAT

01:43:43.617 --> 01:43:47.321
LEGISLATORS PLACE ON ALLOWING.

01:43:47.387 --> 01:43:50.791
ACCESS. TO ONE OF OUR PRIME

01:43:50.857 --> 01:43:52.659
TREASURES THE UC'S FOR

01:43:52.726 --> 01:43:54.628
CALIFORNIA STUDENTS THAT IS

01:43:54.695 --> 01:43:55.862
UNQUESTIONABLE I DON'T THINK

01:43:55.929 --> 01:43:57.631
THAT THAT'S DEBATED I STRUGGLE

01:43:57.698 --> 01:44:01.101
WITH REFLECTING ON WHAT A

01:44:01.168 --> 01:44:02.803
DISINVESTMENT LOOKS LIKE FOR

01:44:02.869 --> 01:44:04.838
CALIFORNIA STUDENTS --

01:44:04.905 --> 01:44:07.140
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE

01:44:07.207 --> 01:44:08.875
MAGIC NUMBER IS I DON'T KNOW

01:44:08.942 --> 01:44:10.110
WHAT THE BALANCE IS I MEAN THE

01:44:10.177 --> 01:44:12.579
QUESTION WAS POSED IF WE GAVE X.

01:44:12.646 --> 01:44:13.480
AMOUNT OF MONEY I MEAN

01:44:13.547 --> 01:44:14.681
ESSENTIALLY.

01:44:14.748 --> 01:44:15.949
RIGHT THEN DOES THAT.

01:44:16.016 --> 01:44:17.818
DECREASE OR DOES THAT STOP OUT

01:44:17.884 --> 01:44:19.620
OF STATE IN ROME IT FROM GOING

01:44:19.686 --> 01:44:21.088
UP -- BUT

01:44:21.154 --> 01:44:22.589
THE TRUTH IS IS THAT.

01:44:22.656 --> 01:44:24.758
WHEN THERE IS AN OVERALL BUDGET?

01:44:24.825 --> 01:44:26.960
I AT LEAST THE WAY THAT I SAW IT

01:44:27.027 --> 01:44:28.362
WORK OUT IT DIDN'T SAY IT WILL

01:44:28.428 --> 01:44:29.229
THIS IS HOW MUCH OUT OF STATE

01:44:29.296 --> 01:44:30.697
STUDENTS ARE BRINGING IN AND

01:44:30.764 --> 01:44:31.965
THIS IS HOW MUCH STAYS FOR OUT

01:44:32.032 --> 01:44:32.633
OF STATE.

01:44:32.699 --> 01:44:34.234
THIS IS HOW MUCH MONEY ALL COMES

01:44:34.301 --> 01:44:36.169
IN AND HELPS EVERYONE A LOT OF

01:44:36.236 --> 01:44:37.537
THE STUDENT SUPPORT SERVICES

01:44:37.604 --> 01:44:38.839
DON'T MAKE.

01:44:38.905 --> 01:44:40.374
DON'T DISTINGUISH BY WHETHER

01:44:40.440 --> 01:44:43.010
YOU'RE AT THERE'S AN OFFICE OF

01:44:43.076 --> 01:44:44.211
INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS BUT

01:44:44.277 --> 01:44:45.846
OUTSIDE OF THAT IF YOU GO TO

01:44:45.912 --> 01:44:47.648
DISABLE STUDENT SERVICES IF YOU

01:44:47.714 --> 01:44:49.716
IDENTIFY WITH AN ETHNIC GROUP

01:44:49.783 --> 01:44:51.018
AND YOU GO TO THAT YOU KNOW

01:44:51.084 --> 01:44:52.352
CULTURAL CENTERS --

01:44:52.419 --> 01:44:54.054
IF YOU GO TO CHIU DURING IF YOU

01:44:54.121 --> 01:44:56.923
GO TO ANY OF THIS THAT SAME POT

01:44:56.990 --> 01:44:58.492
OF MONEY IS HELPING ALL STUDENTS.

01:44:58.558 --> 01:45:01.194
AND I STRUGGLE WITH THIS I DO --

01:45:01.261 --> 01:45:03.330
BECAUSE I A THINK THAT WE WILL

01:45:03.397 --> 01:45:05.232
CONTINUE AS LEGISLATORS TO

01:45:05.298 --> 01:45:06.833
REPRESENT --

01:45:06.900 --> 01:45:08.869
THE COMMUNITIES THAT WE SERVE

01:45:08.935 --> 01:45:09.903
AND WE'RE GOING TO BE THE

01:45:09.970 --> 01:45:11.772
LOUDEST VOICES FOR THOSE

01:45:11.838 --> 01:45:13.040
COMMUNITIES WRIST RESEARCH.

01:45:13.106 --> 01:45:17.177
I ALSO CAUTION AS TO GET.

01:45:17.244 --> 01:45:18.945
TO BE CAREFUL ON HOW MUCH WE

01:45:19.012 --> 01:45:20.547
WANT TO OPEN UP.

01:45:20.614 --> 01:45:22.349
THE CONVERSATION ABOUT THE VALUE

01:45:22.416 --> 01:45:24.184
OF DIVERSITY BECAUSE AS SOMEONE

01:45:24.251 --> 01:45:25.585
WHO HAS HELP FIRST GENERATION

01:45:25.652 --> 01:45:27.287
STUDENTS --

01:45:27.354 --> 01:45:28.388
LOW INCOME STUDENTS STUDENTS

01:45:28.455 --> 01:45:29.256
FROM ETHNICALLY UNDER

01:45:29.322 --> 01:45:30.824
REPRESENTED BACKGROUNDS I CAN

01:45:30.891 --> 01:45:32.626
TELL YOU THAT OUR SAME COMMENT

01:45:32.693 --> 01:45:33.760
THAT COME OUT OF OUR MOUTH FOR

01:45:33.827 --> 01:45:35.162
INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS ARE THE

01:45:35.228 --> 01:45:37.664
SAME COMMENTS THAT WILL BE USED.

01:45:37.731 --> 01:45:40.000
BY SOMETIMES OUR CONSTITUENTS TO

01:45:40.067 --> 01:45:41.835
MAKE THE CASE AGAINST FIRST

01:45:41.902 --> 01:45:44.004
GENERATION STUDENTS STUDENTS WHO

01:45:44.071 --> 01:45:46.306
APPLY FOR AT STUDENTS WHO.

01:45:46.373 --> 01:45:49.209
ARE.

01:45:49.276 --> 01:45:50.711
BENEFITING FROM US.

01:45:50.777 --> 01:45:52.412
FROM A CAL GRANDSON CERTAINLY

01:45:52.479 --> 01:45:53.213
FOR A DREAMER STUDENTS AND WE

01:45:53.280 --> 01:45:54.748
GOT AND IT'S CARE I MEAN I JUST

01:45:54.815 --> 01:45:56.450
WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL --

01:45:56.516 --> 01:45:59.119
THAT THERE IS A VALUE TO DAY FOR

01:45:59.186 --> 01:45:59.953
STUDENTS --

01:46:00.020 --> 01:46:01.621
AND IT YOU KNOW I I THINK IT'S

01:46:01.688 --> 01:46:03.790
AN IMPORTANT VALUE THAT WE HAVE

01:46:03.857 --> 01:46:05.125
STATED OUR BUDGET HAS STATED IT

01:46:05.192 --> 01:46:08.261
SO I HOPE THAT WE CAN FIND THE

01:46:08.328 --> 01:46:09.996
RIGHT FORMULA --

01:46:10.063 --> 01:46:11.665
TO INSURE THAT OUR OBJECTIVES

01:46:11.732 --> 01:46:14.601
CONTINUE TO GET MATT AS A STATE --

01:46:14.668 --> 01:46:15.769
BUT I CERTAINLY THINK THAT

01:46:15.836 --> 01:46:17.537
THERE'S BEEN QUESTIONS THAT HAVE

01:46:17.604 --> 01:46:18.839
BEEN POSED BY.

01:46:18.905 --> 01:46:20.340
STATE REPRESENTATIVES IN THIS

01:46:20.407 --> 01:46:22.542
ROOM TODAY THAT NEED TO BE

01:46:22.609 --> 01:46:23.510
FLESHED OUT.

01:46:23.577 --> 01:46:25.912
WE HAVE TO GO BACK AND DELIVER

01:46:25.979 --> 01:46:29.049
THIS MESS DELIVER THIS MESSAGE

01:46:29.116 --> 01:46:31.184
THEN YOU KNOW YOU HERE BECAUSE

01:46:31.251 --> 01:46:32.652
THAT IS OUR JOB TO TALK TO THE

01:46:32.719 --> 01:46:34.287
PUBLIC TO EXPLAIN TO THEM WHAT

01:46:34.354 --> 01:46:35.555
OUR POLICIES ARE.

01:46:35.622 --> 01:46:37.424
AND SO IF THERE'S NOT CONFIDENCE

01:46:37.491 --> 01:46:39.092
ON OUR PART --

01:46:39.159 --> 01:46:41.495
WE CAN'T PROJECT THAT CONFIDENCE

01:46:41.561 --> 01:46:43.730
TO OUR CONSTITUENTS AND IN THE

01:46:43.797 --> 01:46:45.031
END I'VE SAID IT OVER AND OVER

01:46:45.098 --> 01:46:46.900
THIS IS ABOUT THE FACT THAT THIS

01:46:46.967 --> 01:46:48.535
IS AN UNBELIEVABLY VALUED

01:46:48.602 --> 01:46:50.137
RESOURCE THAT THERE'S NOT ENOUGH

01:46:50.203 --> 01:46:51.938
OF AND THAT I THINK IS AT THE

01:46:52.005 --> 01:46:53.273
ROOT OF THE PROBLEM.

01:46:53.340 --> 01:46:54.608
YES.

01:46:54.674 --> 01:46:56.676
OKAY THANK YOU SO I'LL TRY TO

01:46:56.743 --> 01:46:58.078
WRAP THIS UP HERE SO CLEARLY.

01:46:58.145 --> 01:47:00.347
THIS IS THE ISSUE THAT WE WANT

01:47:00.413 --> 01:47:01.915
TO SERVE ON THE SUBCOMMITTEE

01:47:01.982 --> 01:47:03.450
ABOUT TALKING ABOUT YEARS

01:47:03.517 --> 01:47:05.285
CALIFORNIA'S ACCESS FOR

01:47:05.352 --> 01:47:07.587
CALIFORNIANS AND I'M MORE AND

01:47:07.654 --> 01:47:08.955
MORE STUDENTS ARE.

01:47:09.022 --> 01:47:10.357
ARE TAKING THE COURSES AND

01:47:10.423 --> 01:47:13.827
ELIGIBLE IN APPLYING HUNDRED AND

01:47:13.894 --> 01:47:14.294
SEVENTY SEVEN THOUSAND

01:47:14.361 --> 01:47:16.930
APPLICATIONS IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN.

01:47:16.997 --> 01:47:18.698
AND NOT ENOUGH FOR GETTING AND

01:47:18.765 --> 01:47:21.201
SO IT'S SUPPLY DEMAND ONE ON ONE

01:47:21.268 --> 01:47:23.336
AND WE'RE GOING TO FIGHT TO

01:47:23.403 --> 01:47:26.106
INCREASE THE NUMBER DID.

01:47:26.173 --> 01:47:29.176
SLOTS FOR CALIFORNIANS BUT THIS

01:47:29.242 --> 01:47:31.144
THE NON RESIN ISSUE IS SOMETHING

01:47:31.211 --> 01:47:33.113
THAT'S NOT GOING AWAY AND AND I

01:47:33.180 --> 01:47:34.147
TOTALLY CONCUR WITH ASSEMBLY

01:47:34.214 --> 01:47:35.348
MEMBER --

01:47:35.415 --> 01:47:36.616
TEAM JUST ON THE MATHEMATICS

01:47:36.683 --> 01:47:37.951
THAT'S THAT'S WHY WE DID THE

01:47:38.018 --> 01:47:39.186
POLICY.

01:47:39.252 --> 01:47:40.420
YOU KNOW I I THINK HE CAN

01:47:40.487 --> 01:47:42.622
YOURSELF AND AND BEING DISHONEST

01:47:42.689 --> 01:47:43.023
TO TELL US THAT.

01:47:43.089 --> 01:47:45.158
YOU KNOW FOR A HUNDRED AND SIXTY

01:47:45.225 --> 01:47:46.560
YEARS ACTUALLY WERE FINE WITH

01:47:46.626 --> 01:47:47.961
MINUS 5% AND THEN ALL OF A

01:47:48.028 --> 01:47:48.929
SUDDEN --

01:47:48.995 --> 01:47:50.730
WHEN THAT THE BUDGET WAS REALLY

01:47:50.797 --> 01:47:51.598
BECAUSE WE NEEDED TO TO KEEP THE

01:47:51.665 --> 01:47:53.333
LIGHTS ON I DON'T I DON'T BLAME

01:47:53.400 --> 01:47:54.668
THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA THE

01:47:54.734 --> 01:47:55.535
THREE POTS OF MONEY?

01:47:55.602 --> 01:47:58.205
STUDENT FEES STATE MONEY AND NON

01:47:58.271 --> 01:48:00.207
RESIDENT TUITION YOU CAN LOOK AT

01:48:00.273 --> 01:48:01.141
YOUR PIE CHART THEY'RE ALL THERE

01:48:01.208 --> 01:48:02.776
AND SO IT'S A THREE LEGGED STOOL

01:48:02.843 --> 01:48:04.444
SO NOW IT IS PART OF THE STILL

01:48:04.511 --> 01:48:05.545
FOR THE RIP ONE OUT.

01:48:05.612 --> 01:48:07.647
RASPY MONEY COMING SOMEWHERE

01:48:07.714 --> 01:48:08.815
ELSE AND SO IT'S GOING TO BE

01:48:08.882 --> 01:48:10.116
SEATED CALIFORNIA MONEY.

01:48:10.183 --> 01:48:12.385
FINE WHERE WE CAN TAKE A LOOK AT

01:48:12.452 --> 01:48:14.054
THAT BUT I REALIZE WE HAVE OTHER.

01:48:14.120 --> 01:48:15.722
ISSUES AS WELL --

01:48:15.789 --> 01:48:19.926
STUDENT FEET REVENUE --

01:48:19.993 --> 01:48:22.629
YOU KNOW I KNOW WEEK PATTERSON

01:48:22.696 --> 01:48:24.231
SOMETIMES AS A COST AS WELL AS

01:48:24.297 --> 01:48:26.600
OVER. 50% NEARLY TWO THIRDS GET

01:48:26.666 --> 01:48:28.535
FINANCIAL AID PAY NO FEES THAT

01:48:28.602 --> 01:48:29.870
YOU SEE WITH CAL GRANT.

01:48:29.936 --> 01:48:32.539
MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP AND AND

01:48:32.606 --> 01:48:33.473
UNIVERSITY GRANT [inaudible]

01:48:33.540 --> 01:48:36.343
AND WITH THAT WE DON'T HAVE AS

01:48:36.409 --> 01:48:38.778
MUCH MONEY TO EXPAND NONRESIDENT

01:48:38.845 --> 01:48:39.079
ROMANTIC --

01:48:39.145 --> 01:48:40.313
SO.

01:48:40.380 --> 01:48:42.682
IT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT --

01:48:42.749 --> 01:48:45.051
HIS IS ON OUR ON OUR MINDS GOING

01:48:45.118 --> 01:48:45.952
FORWARD SO --

01:48:46.019 --> 01:48:47.153
WITH THAT WE WENT --

01:48:47.220 --> 01:48:48.688
TO HOLD THIS ISSUE OPEN AND

01:48:48.755 --> 01:48:49.856
REVISIT IT --

01:48:49.923 --> 01:48:51.825
FOR THE VISION AND MAYBE WE CAN

01:48:51.892 --> 01:48:53.159
EXCUSE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE

01:48:53.226 --> 01:48:54.995
LA GO AND ASK THE UC PANEL TO

01:48:55.061 --> 01:48:56.596
COME UP HERE.

01:48:56.663 --> 01:48:58.832
WE'RE GOING TO IT NOW TALK ABOUT

01:48:58.899 --> 01:49:00.533
THIS ISSUE RELATES TO THE

01:49:00.600 --> 01:49:02.369
COLLEGE ADMISSIONS CHEATING

01:49:02.435 --> 01:49:03.837
SCANDAL.

01:49:03.904 --> 01:49:09.009
AND AS THE AS THE I'LL WAIT TILL

01:49:09.075 --> 01:49:11.011
THE GROUP COMES UP.

01:49:11.077 --> 01:49:12.812
SO I I DECIDED TO AGENDA IS THIS

01:49:12.879 --> 01:49:14.214
WE DECIDE TO AGENDA IS THIS YOU

01:49:14.281 --> 01:49:15.749
KNOW WE THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD BE

01:49:15.815 --> 01:49:18.018
VERY AWKWARD TO TALK ABOUT THE

01:49:18.084 --> 01:49:19.686
UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA.

01:49:19.753 --> 01:49:20.654
AND EMISSIONS WOULD NOT --

01:49:20.720 --> 01:49:24.157
ADDRESSING BEEN IN THE ROOM AND

01:49:24.224 --> 01:49:25.725
THAT IS THIS --

01:49:25.792 --> 01:49:27.494
RECENT THAT NATIONAL COLLEGE

01:49:27.560 --> 01:49:29.129
EMISSIONS CHEATING SCANDAL

01:49:29.195 --> 01:49:30.630
ANNOUNCED LAST WEEK BY THE

01:49:30.697 --> 01:49:32.532
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE SHOWING

01:49:32.599 --> 01:49:34.034
THE REAL UGLY SIDE.

01:49:34.100 --> 01:49:36.169
OF COLLEGE ADMISSIONS AND AGAIN

01:49:36.236 --> 01:49:38.571
NOT JUST UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA

01:49:38.638 --> 01:49:40.273
TO TWO HIGH PROFILE EXAMPLE SO

01:49:40.340 --> 01:49:41.841
FAR --

01:49:41.908 --> 01:49:43.109
OTHERS THAT THAT IS SO CALLED

01:49:43.176 --> 01:49:45.145
ELITE COLLEGES ACROSS THE

01:49:45.211 --> 01:49:47.847
COUNTRY AND JUST A JUST A JUST --

01:49:47.914 --> 01:49:48.615
TO SUMMARIZE WHAT OUR US

01:49:48.682 --> 01:49:50.083
ATTORNEY SAID WHICH I THINK IS

01:49:50.150 --> 01:49:51.184
SO POWERFUL.

01:49:51.251 --> 01:49:53.620
HE SAID THERE CAN BE NO SEPARATE

01:49:53.687 --> 01:49:55.789
ADMISSIONS PROCESS FOR THE

01:49:55.855 --> 01:49:57.324
WEALTHY BUT THERE IT'S AND I

01:49:57.390 --> 01:49:59.092
THINK THAT ADDRESSES THE ISSUE

01:49:59.159 --> 01:50:00.393
WE TALKED ABOUT A SECOND AGO

01:50:00.460 --> 01:50:01.594
WITH ENROLLMENT I THINK THAT'S

01:50:01.661 --> 01:50:03.330
WHY IT'S IT'S SO MADDENING FOR

01:50:03.396 --> 01:50:04.597
SO MANY PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA.

01:50:04.664 --> 01:50:07.334
BECAUSE IT'S SO HARD TO GET INTO

01:50:07.400 --> 01:50:08.835
THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA.

01:50:08.902 --> 01:50:10.203
AND THERE'S SO MUCH PRESSURE TO

01:50:10.270 --> 01:50:11.438
GET IN THERE ON THE STUDENTS ON

01:50:11.504 --> 01:50:12.572
THE PARENTS.

01:50:12.639 --> 01:50:13.640
AND WE SEE THIS WITH THE

01:50:13.707 --> 01:50:14.708
INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS

01:50:14.774 --> 01:50:16.743
DISPLACING CALIFORNIA KIDS BUT

01:50:16.810 --> 01:50:17.777
WHEN YOU SEE.

01:50:17.844 --> 01:50:20.413
OUT RIGHT FRAUD AND CHEATING TO

01:50:20.480 --> 01:50:21.915
TO TAKE UP SOME OF THE SCARE

01:50:21.982 --> 01:50:22.849
SEATS --

01:50:22.916 --> 01:50:24.384
MAYBE IT'S TOO WE THINK IT'S

01:50:24.451 --> 01:50:25.885
MANY MORE WERE GOING TO GET TO

01:50:25.952 --> 01:50:27.487
THAT THAT THAT'S WAY TOO MANY.

01:50:27.554 --> 01:50:28.955
AND THAT'S WHY THIS IS SUCH A

01:50:29.022 --> 01:50:31.224
BIG ISSUE AND TO OUR SOCIETY IS

01:50:31.291 --> 01:50:33.159
BASED UPON THE MERITOCRACY THAT

01:50:33.226 --> 01:50:34.427
WE THINK ARE MISSIONS.

01:50:34.494 --> 01:50:37.063
SYSTEM SHOULD BE FAIR AND JUST

01:50:37.130 --> 01:50:38.732
TO THE SHOULD BE THIS FRONT DOOR.

01:50:38.798 --> 01:50:42.435
AS THE THE NEW YORK TIMES ALLUDE

01:50:42.502 --> 01:50:44.971
TO LAST FOR A LOT OF MONEY THAT

01:50:45.038 --> 01:50:49.709
BY DORM AND IT'S THROUGH THESE

01:50:49.776 --> 01:50:51.544
LEGACY ADMISSIONS BUT THIS.

01:50:51.611 --> 01:50:53.113
A SIDE DOOR AS FAR AS

01:50:53.179 --> 01:50:54.714
ESSENTIALLY BRIBING PEOPLE UNDER

01:50:54.781 --> 01:50:56.950
THE TABLE IS JUST OUTRAGEOUS AND

01:50:57.017 --> 01:50:58.385
RAISES SO MANY --

01:50:58.451 --> 01:50:59.953
QUESTIONS WE HAVE WAY MORE

01:51:00.020 --> 01:51:01.554
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS BUT WE DID

01:51:01.621 --> 01:51:03.289
WANT TO ALLOW THE UNIVERSITY

01:51:03.356 --> 01:51:05.392
CALIFORNIA TO TO GIVE US.

01:51:05.458 --> 01:51:07.694
AN AN UPDATE TODAY AND NOW SOME

01:51:07.761 --> 01:51:08.628
SPECIFIC --

01:51:08.695 --> 01:51:10.397
FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS AND SO YOU

01:51:10.463 --> 01:51:11.631

01:51:11.698 --> 01:51:13.166
FAR AS HOW DOES THIS HOW DID

01:51:13.233 --> 01:51:13.867
THIS HAPPEN.

01:51:13.933 --> 01:51:16.036
THE THE THE THE THE AMOUNTS OF

01:51:16.102 --> 01:51:19.773
INCIDENTS THAT WE KNOW OF SO FAR --

01:51:19.839 --> 01:51:21.574
WHICH WE DO GOING FORWARD AS FAR

01:51:21.641 --> 01:51:23.243
AS LEGACY ADMISSIONS THESE TAG

EMISSIONS FOR US FOR FOR

01:51:25.045 --> 01:51:26.780
ATHLETES --

01:51:26.846 --> 01:51:28.548
TAKING A LOOK AT THE S. A. T.

01:52:02.515 --> 01:52:03.850
WE WANT TO ALLOW OPENING

01:52:03.917 --> 01:52:05.885
COMMENTS FROM A FEW PEOPLE AT

01:52:05.952 --> 01:52:07.220
FIRST INCLUDING CHAIRMAN MEDINA.

01:52:07.287 --> 01:52:07.987
THANK YOU --

01:52:08.054 --> 01:52:11.091
CHAIR MCCARTY AND THANK YOU FOR

01:52:11.157 --> 01:52:11.891
PUTTING THIS ON THE AGENDA --

01:52:11.958 --> 01:52:13.793
IN THE IN THE PAST SIX YEARS I

01:52:13.860 --> 01:52:16.930
DON'T KNOW THAT THERE'S AN ISSUE --

01:52:16.996 --> 01:52:18.598
THAT IS GOT THE ATTENTION OF THE

01:52:18.665 --> 01:52:20.967
PUBLIC A MORE THAN WHAT HAS

01:52:21.034 --> 01:52:22.368
HAPPENED IN THE LAST WEEK.

01:52:22.435 --> 01:52:25.205
IT WHEN I LOOK AT AT NEWSPAPERS

01:52:25.271 --> 01:52:26.673
ACROSS THE NATION.

01:52:26.739 --> 01:52:28.808
FROM THE SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE

01:52:28.875 --> 01:52:30.743
TO THE NEW YORK TIMES --

01:52:30.810 --> 01:52:32.412
TO THE LA TIMES.

01:52:32.479 --> 01:52:34.047
YOU KNOW THIS IS AN ISSUE.

01:52:34.114 --> 01:52:36.116
THAT FOR SOME REASON REALLY IS

01:52:36.182 --> 01:52:38.251
CAPTURED THE ATTENTION OF THE

01:52:38.318 --> 01:52:39.652
AMERICAN PUBLIC.

01:52:39.719 --> 01:52:41.321
AND AND I THINK BECAUSE IT DEALS

01:52:41.387 --> 01:52:43.790
WITH A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT ARE.

01:52:43.857 --> 01:52:46.759
PRECIOUS TO THE AMERICAN PUBLIC

01:52:46.826 --> 01:52:49.729
WHEN I WAS A SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER --

01:52:49.796 --> 01:52:52.132
LIKE MY COLLEAGUE --

01:52:52.198 --> 01:52:53.967
WE USED TO SAY THAT TWO THINGS

01:52:54.033 --> 01:52:55.335
MOST PRECIOUS TO FOLKS WERE

01:52:55.401 --> 01:52:56.503
THEIR CHILDREN.

01:52:56.569 --> 01:53:00.573
AND THEIR MONEY.

01:53:00.640 --> 01:53:01.774
AND THIS DEALS WITH BOTH OF THEM.

01:53:01.841 --> 01:53:02.775
YOU KNOW THIS DEALS WITH THE

01:53:02.842 --> 01:53:05.178
AMERICAN DREAM WITH THE AMERICAN

01:53:05.245 --> 01:53:06.679
DREAM OF UPWARD MOBILITY.

01:53:06.746 --> 01:53:08.314
WITH THE AMERICAN DREAM THAT

01:53:08.381 --> 01:53:10.850
HARD WORK PAYS OFF.

01:53:10.917 --> 01:53:12.919
SO THIS REALLY IS AN ISSUE THE

01:53:12.986 --> 01:53:14.621
TO THAT THEY CAN --

01:53:14.687 --> 01:53:16.689
SHAKE THE CONFIDENCE OF THE

01:53:16.756 --> 01:53:18.124
AMERICAN PUBLIC SHAKE THE

01:53:18.191 --> 01:53:19.692
CONFIDENCE OF THE STUDENTS THAT

01:53:19.759 --> 01:53:21.628
I TAUGHT.

01:53:21.694 --> 01:53:23.029
SHAKE THE CONFIDENCE OF THE

01:53:23.096 --> 01:53:25.565
PARENTS WE REPRESENT.

01:53:25.632 --> 01:53:27.467
THAT THAT HARD WORK WILL PAY OFF

01:53:27.534 --> 01:53:28.835
IN THE END.

01:53:28.902 --> 01:53:31.604
AND IT IS SOMETHING THAT I I

01:53:31.671 --> 01:53:33.873
THINK WE WANT TO HOLD ON TO BUT

01:53:33.940 --> 01:53:35.375
IT IS SOMETHING IT IS A TOPIC

01:53:35.441 --> 01:53:37.277
THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT AND WILL

01:53:37.343 --> 01:53:39.078
HOW DID WE GET THERE.

01:53:39.145 --> 01:53:40.880
HOW DID WE GET TO THIS POINT?

01:53:40.947 --> 01:53:42.916
HOW DO WE GET TO THIS KIND OF

01:53:42.982 --> 01:53:45.852
OBSERVED PLACE WERE SOME PARENT

01:53:45.919 --> 01:53:48.221
IS WILLING TO PUT UP?

01:53:48.288 --> 01:53:50.924
HALF A MILLION DOLLARS. TO MAKE

01:53:50.990 --> 01:53:52.358
SURE THAT THEIR SON OR DAUGHTER

01:53:52.425 --> 01:53:55.862
GOES TO A PARTICULAR INSTITUTION.

01:53:55.929 --> 01:53:58.831
WHY IS THAT OF SO MUCH VALUE?

01:53:58.898 --> 01:54:00.733
DOES THAT REALLY IS THERE REALLY

01:54:00.800 --> 01:54:02.502
THAT MUCH OF AN ECONOMIC IMPACT

01:54:02.569 --> 01:54:03.937
THAT IS GOING TO HAVE ON THE

01:54:04.003 --> 01:54:05.471
FUTURE OF THEIR CHILD.

01:54:05.538 --> 01:54:07.106
OR IS THERE SOMETHING MORE AT

01:54:07.173 --> 01:54:08.675
WORK.

01:54:08.741 --> 01:54:10.877
SO I I THINK IT IS A VERY BROAD

01:54:10.944 --> 01:54:11.744
ISSUE.

01:54:11.811 --> 01:54:13.446
THAT WE HAVE HERE IS I I THINK

01:54:13.513 --> 01:54:15.882
IT IS ALMOST A SOCIETAL ISSUE.

01:54:15.949 --> 01:54:17.817
AND THAT THERE ARE SOCIETAL

01:54:17.884 --> 01:54:20.887
QUESTIONS TO BE ANSWERED.

01:54:20.954 --> 01:54:22.555
IN IN THIS.

01:54:22.622 --> 01:54:24.490
I I THINK AS WE MOVE FORWARD IT

01:54:24.557 --> 01:54:26.159
IS NOT SO MUCH ABOUT.

01:54:26.226 --> 01:54:27.894
FINDING WRONG DOING WITH A

01:54:27.961 --> 01:54:30.430
PARTICULAR INSTITUTION.

01:54:30.496 --> 01:54:33.866
OR A PARTICULAR SYSTEM BECAUSE

01:54:33.933 --> 01:54:35.268
ACROSS THE NATION SO MANY

01:54:35.335 --> 01:54:36.369
COLLEGES [inaudible]

01:54:36.436 --> 01:54:38.104
HAVE BEEN.

01:54:38.171 --> 01:54:40.440
I WOULD SAY SNOOKERED WERE TAKEN

01:54:40.506 --> 01:54:42.642
ADVANTAGE OF TO TALK ABOUT A

01:54:42.709 --> 01:54:44.577
SIDE DOOR WHAT DO YOU FROM IS.

01:54:44.644 --> 01:54:45.511
YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE TALKING

01:54:45.578 --> 01:54:48.781
ABOUT IS CHEATING LINE FRAUD.

01:54:48.848 --> 01:54:51.284
IT ALSO THE COLLEGES SIDE DOOR

01:54:51.351 --> 01:54:53.019
OF YOU KNOW I HAVE ISSUE WITH

01:54:53.086 --> 01:54:54.854
THAT.

01:54:54.921 --> 01:54:57.757
BLATANT LINE BLATANT CHEATING OF

01:54:57.824 --> 01:55:00.126
BUYING PAYINGFOR SOMEONE TO

01:55:00.193 --> 01:55:01.628
TAKE YOUR YOUR COLLEGE.

01:55:01.694 --> 01:55:04.030
ENTRANCE EXAM IN A PHOTO

01:55:04.097 --> 01:55:06.332
SHOPPING --

01:55:06.399 --> 01:55:07.500
ATHLETES PICTURES.

01:55:07.567 --> 01:55:09.135
SO I I WANT TO SAY AT THE OUTSET

01:55:09.202 --> 01:55:10.970
THAT I DON'T THINK THIS IS ABOUT

01:55:11.037 --> 01:55:11.904
LOOKING.

01:55:11.971 --> 01:55:14.307
FOR OF WRONGDOING ON THE PART OF

01:55:14.374 --> 01:55:17.076
A COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY SYSTEM.

01:55:17.143 --> 01:55:18.645
I THINK IT IS CLEAR THAT IT IS

01:55:18.711 --> 01:55:20.880
INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE BEEN

01:55:20.947 --> 01:55:22.148
INVOLVED IN WRONGDOING WHETHER

01:55:22.215 --> 01:55:23.249
IT'S PARENTS.

01:55:23.316 --> 01:55:25.852
COACHES THE PROCTORS AND THAT

01:55:25.918 --> 01:55:27.387
THOSE PEOPLE.

01:55:27.453 --> 01:55:29.789
SHOULD AND WILL BE PROSECUTED I

01:55:29.856 --> 01:55:31.224
KNOW THAT COLLEGES ARE MOVING

01:55:31.291 --> 01:55:32.892
FORWARD TO LOOKING AT WHO WERE

01:55:32.959 --> 01:55:34.427
THE STUDENTS INVOLVED.

01:55:34.494 --> 01:55:36.262
AND IN THE CASE OF U. S. C. I

01:55:36.329 --> 01:55:38.131
THINK STUDENTS OF ALREADY BEEN

01:55:38.197 --> 01:55:39.699
RELEASE I THINK --

01:55:39.766 --> 01:55:40.800
UNIVERSITIES LIKE U. S. C. OR

01:55:40.867 --> 01:55:44.871
LOOK STUDENTS WHO BENEFITTED

01:55:44.937 --> 01:55:46.773
FROM THIS AND IN IN THE

01:55:46.839 --> 01:55:49.208
ADMISSIONS PROCESS AND THEY WILL

01:55:49.275 --> 01:55:50.643
BE LOOKED AT AS WELL.

01:55:50.710 --> 01:55:52.145
SO I JUST WANTED TO SHARE THAT

01:55:52.211 --> 01:55:53.313
AT THE OUTSET.

01:55:53.379 --> 01:55:56.349

ALONG WITH TRYING TO IDENTIFY

02:13:57.662 --> 02:13:58.864
SOME OF THE SHORTCOMINGS ALONG

02:13:58.930 --> 02:14:00.065

02:16:28.947 --> 02:16:29.848
THERE'S A SMALL NUMBER OF

02:16:29.915 --> 02:16:31.750
STUDENTS WHO ARE EXCEPTIONALLY

IN THE CASE OF STUDENT ATHLETES --

02:16:50.235 --> 02:16:53.004
THE POLICY OF FOR WHAT IS CALLED

AT EMISSIONS BY EXCEPTION IS 6%

02:16:56.508 --> 02:16:57.842

02:18:49.320 --> 02:18:50.155
RELATIONSHIP --

02:18:50.221 --> 02:18:51.790
BETWEEN THOSE INDUSTRIES OKAY

02:18:51.856 --> 02:18:52.424
BUT AND THAT SECOND QUESTION IS

02:18:52.490 --> 02:18:53.358
SHOULD THERE BE SHOULD WE HAVE

02:18:53.425 --> 02:18:57.028
SOME TYPE OF BASIC --

02:18:57.095 --> 02:19:01.332
REGISTRY THAT INDIVIDUALS NO YOU

02:19:01.399 --> 02:19:02.567
KNOW WHAT THE WHAT THEY'RE

02:19:02.634 --> 02:19:04.469
GETTING THEMSELVES INTO AS FAR

02:19:04.536 --> 02:19:05.637
AS THIS THAT HAS A UNIVERSITY

02:19:05.704 --> 02:19:07.872
THOUGHT ABOUT --

02:19:07.939 --> 02:19:09.240
YOU KNOW HAVING SOME TYPE OF OF

02:19:09.307 --> 02:19:10.508
OF OF OF THE OFFICIAL

02:19:10.575 --> 02:19:12.010
SANCTIONING OF THE OF THESE OF

02:19:12.077 --> 02:19:13.244
THESE -- OF

02:19:13.311 --> 02:19:15.180
THESE BUSINESSES AND CONSULTANTS

02:19:15.246 --> 02:19:15.914
OUT THERE.

02:19:15.980 --> 02:19:18.383
I'M MAKING A NOTE OF THAT.

02:19:18.450 --> 02:19:21.252
THE SUGGESTION BECAUSE I HI.

02:19:21.319 --> 02:19:22.754
I HADN'T THOUGHT ABOUT IT AND

02:19:22.821 --> 02:19:24.389
I'M NOT AWARE OF OTHERS WHO HAVE

02:19:24.456 --> 02:19:28.293
I THINK THAT'S IT AS SUGGESTION

02:19:28.359 --> 02:19:29.761
WORTH WORTH EXAMINING.

02:19:29.828 --> 02:19:30.495
AND THEN --

02:19:30.562 --> 02:19:31.863
THE LAST SET OF FIVE QUESTIONS

02:19:31.930 --> 02:19:33.965
RELATED TO THE TESTING PIECE OF

02:19:34.032 --> 02:19:35.300
THIS AND SO.

02:19:35.366 --> 02:19:36.334
A LOT OF DEBATE OF COURSE

02:19:36.401 --> 02:19:37.602
TONIGHT I HAVE ASKED THE

02:19:37.669 --> 02:19:38.937
QUESTION AS WELL --

02:19:39.003 --> 02:19:42.474
ABOUT THE SAT AND FRANKLY I WAS

02:19:42.540 --> 02:19:43.041
SOMEWHAT.

02:19:43.108 --> 02:19:45.744
IN THE SPIRES NOT THE RIGHT WORD

02:19:45.810 --> 02:19:46.911
BUT IT INTRIGUED ABOUT THIS --

02:19:46.978 --> 02:19:48.847
ALMOST TWENTY YEARS AGO WHEN ARE

02:19:48.913 --> 02:19:50.615

QUESTION AND AND TALKED ABOUT.

02:19:55.787 --> 02:19:57.822
THE NEED TO POTENTIALLY GET AWAY

02:19:57.889 --> 02:19:59.190
FROM FROM THE S. A. T. AND IT

02:19:59.257 --> 02:20:00.825
GOES BACK TO THE ENROLLMENT

02:20:00.892 --> 02:20:01.826
DEBATE WE HAD AN HOUR AGO

02:20:01.893 --> 02:20:04.329
TALKING ABOUT TEST SCORES AND

02:20:04.395 --> 02:20:06.331
LGBT LOCAL CONTACTS AND ONE THE

02:20:06.397 --> 02:20:08.733
STRONGEST INDICATORS OF SUCCESS.

02:20:08.800 --> 02:20:10.235
OUR TEST SCORES BUT HOW YOU

02:20:10.301 --> 02:20:11.302

02:20:11.369 --> 02:20:12.937
GRADES IN COURSES WHICH HARDER

02:20:13.004 --> 02:20:14.239
TO CHEAT ON THOSE AND IT IS YOUR

02:20:14.305 --> 02:20:16.775
SAT AND SPECIFICALLY HOW YOU DID

02:20:16.841 --> 02:20:17.909
AMONGST YOUR PEERS.

02:20:17.976 --> 02:20:19.644
WHETHER YOU WANT TO THE TOP

02:20:19.711 --> 02:20:22.380

02:20:22.447 --> 02:20:24.082
RANKING SCHOOLS SO I I'M

02:20:24.149 --> 02:20:25.116
UNDERSTANDING IS UNIVERSE

02:20:25.183 --> 02:20:26.851
CALIFORNIA ABOUT A YEAR AGO.

02:20:26.918 --> 02:20:29.254
EMBARKED UPON A A STUDY IN A

REVIEW.

02:20:32.157 --> 02:20:34.325
THIS AND TO POTENTIALLY LOOK AT

02:20:34.392 --> 02:20:37.028
THE FUTURE OF THE S. C. T. S. A.

02:20:37.095 --> 02:20:38.596

02:20:38.663 --> 02:20:40.131
THAT YOU COULD GIVE US AN UPDATE

02:20:40.198 --> 02:20:41.766
ON HOW ON HOW THAT IS

02:20:41.833 --> 02:20:45.270
PROGRESSING ANY INSIGHT TODAY.

02:20:58.483 --> 02:21:00.819

CHAIR MCCARTY OUT OF THE I

02:21:14.933 --> 02:21:16.167
DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS TWENTY YEARS

02:21:16.234 --> 02:21:18.036
AGO BUT THAT I'VE SAWN BOARDS AT

02:21:18.102 --> 02:21:19.003
THAT TIME.

02:21:19.070 --> 02:21:23.341
NGUYEN --

02:21:23.408 --> 02:21:26.477
THE TESTS WERE WERE ON TO THEM

02:21:26.544 --> 02:21:28.379
AT LEAST JUST SOME INSIGHTS FROM

02:21:28.446 --> 02:21:30.248
THAT EXPERIENCE SO --

02:21:30.315 --> 02:21:31.549
THEY ARE MEETING --

02:21:31.616 --> 02:21:34.853
THEY HAVE BEEN COMPRISED OF OF

02:21:34.919 --> 02:21:38.890
OF CYCLE PATRICIANS AND ARE

02:21:38.957 --> 02:21:40.859
INCLUDING TESTS PROPONENTS AND

02:21:40.925 --> 02:21:41.860
CRITICS --

02:21:41.926 --> 02:21:43.228
THE GOAL IS TO APPROACH THIS

02:21:43.294 --> 02:21:45.063
FROM A TRULY ACADEMIC POINT OF

02:21:45.129 --> 02:21:47.599
VIEW I I'M LYING TO TO TO READ

02:21:47.665 --> 02:21:49.234
TO REPORT BACK TO OUR THE

02:21:49.300 --> 02:21:50.001
PHARMACY THE LEGISLATURE AND THE

02:21:50.068 --> 02:21:51.002
STATE -- I

02:21:51.069 --> 02:21:52.937
THINK THE GOAL IS TO ALLOW THAT

02:21:53.004 --> 02:21:55.306
PROCESS TO TO TAKE WHATEVER TIME

02:21:55.373 --> 02:21:56.708
THAT THAT THE GOAL IS TO GET IT

02:21:56.774 --> 02:21:57.976
RIGHT.

02:21:58.042 --> 02:21:59.344
THEN TO GET A QUICK --

02:21:59.410 --> 02:22:01.045
THAT'S WHAT THE THE CHAIR OF THE

02:22:01.112 --> 02:22:03.381
SENATE -- AS

02:22:03.448 --> 02:22:05.483
IS IS PROCEEDING WITH BUT I

02:22:05.550 --> 02:22:07.418
THINK THEY'D BE I I I EXPECT

02:22:07.485 --> 02:22:09.888
THEM TO MOVE EXPEDITIOUSLY OKAY

02:22:09.954 --> 02:22:11.589
AND OF COURSE THERE ARE NONE

02:22:11.656 --> 02:22:12.957
PROS TO THE TEST WHICH UP WHICH

02:22:13.024 --> 02:22:15.226
I'LL GET TO BUT THAT THE CONS

02:22:15.293 --> 02:22:15.793
ARE.

02:22:15.860 --> 02:22:17.729
MY IT IN MINOR SITTING THERE

02:22:17.795 --> 02:22:19.931
THERE ARE FOR THAT JUMP OUT --

02:22:19.998 --> 02:22:24.068
ONE IS THAT --

02:22:24.135 --> 02:22:25.870
OVER THE YEARS IT'S BEEN CULTURE

02:22:25.937 --> 02:22:29.908
ON ROWING JOGGING I THOUGHT ON

02:22:29.974 --> 02:22:32.076
AS TO YOU KNOW --

02:22:32.143 --> 02:22:33.978
ROWING IS TO YOU KNOW WHATEVER

02:22:34.045 --> 02:22:35.613
IN KIDS MAY NOT KNOW THAT THAT

02:22:35.680 --> 02:22:36.881
TYPE OF ACTIVITY IN CERTAIN

02:22:36.948 --> 02:22:38.883
NEIGHBORHOODS AND SO THEY THEY

02:22:38.950 --> 02:22:40.518
THEY CHANGE THAT A BIT.

02:22:40.585 --> 02:22:42.120
THE OTHER IS OF COURSE THAT SOME

02:22:42.186 --> 02:22:44.188
KIDS DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO PAY

02:22:44.255 --> 02:22:46.624
FOR THAT THAT KAPLAN TEST PREP.

02:22:46.691 --> 02:22:49.193
AND RESEARCH SHOWS IF YOU.

02:22:49.260 --> 02:22:50.528
SPOKE ASSIGNED --

02:22:50.595 --> 02:22:52.096
SPENDING A TON OF MONEY YOU CAN

02:22:52.163 --> 02:22:53.197
BECOME A BETTER TEST TAKER TO

02:22:53.264 --> 02:22:55.166
MAKE MORE INTELLIGENT ARE MORE

02:22:55.233 --> 02:22:57.268
LIKELY TO SUCCEED THE UC --

02:22:57.335 --> 02:22:58.836
PROBABLY NOT --

02:22:58.903 --> 02:23:00.104
SO THAT'S THE THOSE ARE THE TWO

02:23:00.171 --> 02:23:02.106
AND THEN THE THE TWO RECENT ONES

02:23:02.173 --> 02:23:02.840
ARE JUST.

02:23:02.907 --> 02:23:04.943
YOU KNOW OFF THE CHARTS AS FAR

02:23:05.009 --> 02:23:08.146
AS YOU KNOW FRAUDULENT AND

02:23:08.212 --> 02:23:09.247
SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW THERE'S

02:23:09.314 --> 02:23:10.181
NO.

02:23:10.248 --> 02:23:11.783
NO ROOM --

02:23:11.849 --> 02:23:17.956
FOR THE YOU KNOW THE ABILITIES

02:23:18.022 --> 02:23:19.190
AND JUST LIKE YOU CAN ON THE

02:23:19.257 --> 02:23:19.824
BOARD COURSE MARIJUANA IS NOW

02:23:19.891 --> 02:23:21.392
LEGAL BUT FIVE YEARS AGO YOU

02:23:21.459 --> 02:23:22.460
WANTED.

02:23:22.527 --> 02:23:23.795
THE MARIJUANA YOU GO TO A DOCTOR

02:23:23.861 --> 02:23:25.730
AND THEY HAD A BAD BACK YOU GOT

02:23:25.797 --> 02:23:27.699
A NOTE WITHIN OUR YOU WHAT YOU

02:23:27.765 --> 02:23:29.300
PAID THE FEE AND THERE'S DOCTOR

02:23:29.367 --> 02:23:30.368
SHOPPING FOR THIS.

02:23:30.435 --> 02:23:31.836
DISABILITY --

02:23:31.903 --> 02:23:33.438
EXEMPTION TO GET MORE TIME AND

02:23:33.504 --> 02:23:34.939
THEN WHO HAS MONEY TO DO THAT

02:23:35.006 --> 02:23:36.207
PEOPLE RESOURCES.

02:23:36.274 --> 02:23:37.875
AND OF COURSE YOU KNOW PAYING

02:23:37.942 --> 02:23:39.510
FOR INDIVIDUALS TO TAKE THE TEST

02:23:39.577 --> 02:23:40.912
FOR IS THE FOURTH ONE WHICH IS

02:23:40.979 --> 02:23:42.680
WRONG AND A CRIME AND PEOPLE ARE

02:23:42.747 --> 02:23:44.048
GOING TO GET --

02:23:44.115 --> 02:23:45.883
PUNISHED AS FAR AS THE PROS OF

02:23:45.950 --> 02:23:49.620
IT -- I KNOW

02:23:49.687 --> 02:23:50.655
THERE ARE THERE ARE THERE ARE.

02:23:50.722 --> 02:23:52.857
IDEAS TO TO KEEP IT GOING I KNOW --

02:23:52.924 --> 02:23:53.524
MISTER O'DONNELL IS TALKED ABOUT

02:23:53.591 --> 02:23:55.393
YOU KNOW BRING THAT INTO THE

02:23:55.460 --> 02:23:56.894
PUBLIC SCHOOL SET UP SYSTEMS SO

02:23:56.961 --> 02:23:58.396
KIDS CAN BE TAKING TESTS WENT

02:23:58.463 --> 02:23:59.297
OUT THIS TEST AND SO.

02:23:59.364 --> 02:24:01.265
THAT'S AN IDEA IF WE DO KEEP

02:24:01.332 --> 02:24:02.700
THIS TEST GOING FORWARD I I

02:24:02.767 --> 02:24:03.968
THINK THAT --

02:24:04.035 --> 02:24:04.802
MERIT SICK --

02:24:04.869 --> 02:24:06.004
THE WITH THE ONE FOR THE YOU SEE

02:24:06.070 --> 02:24:07.405
IN THIS IS REALLY REPORT THIS MY

02:24:07.472 --> 02:24:08.473
LAST QUESTION HERE.

02:24:08.539 --> 02:24:09.941
BUT BUT I WOULD THINK THAT FOR

02:24:10.008 --> 02:24:11.075
THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA ONE OF

02:24:11.142 --> 02:24:13.845
THE OVER ARCHING ISSUES IS A

02:24:13.911 --> 02:24:15.980
HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THOUSAND

02:24:16.047 --> 02:24:16.547
APPLICATIONS THAT'S A LOT.

02:24:16.614 --> 02:24:18.282
IT'S A BIG STACK OF PAPER.

02:24:18.349 --> 02:24:19.484
AND IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT YOU

02:24:19.550 --> 02:24:22.120
KNOW THREE THINGS THAT THE GPA.

02:24:22.186 --> 02:24:24.689
THE THE TEST SCORES AND THE YOU

02:24:24.756 --> 02:24:25.923
KNOW THE PERSONAL EXPERIENCE

02:24:25.990 --> 02:24:28.259
BASED UPON YOUR ESSAY --

02:24:28.326 --> 02:24:31.362
IT IS HARD TO RANK THOSE THE SAT

02:24:31.429 --> 02:24:33.598
SCORE IN THERE SO IT IS THAT ONE

02:24:33.664 --> 02:24:35.500
OF THE DRIVING REASONS WHICH

02:24:35.566 --> 02:24:36.834
KEEPS THE S. A. T. ALIVE IS JUST

02:24:36.901 --> 02:24:38.302
THE SHEER.

02:24:38.369 --> 02:24:40.938
VOLUME OF APPLICATIONS THE UC

02:24:41.005 --> 02:24:43.307
GETS AND HOW IT WOULD JUST

02:24:43.374 --> 02:24:45.543
REALLY BE A LOGISTICAL HEADACHE

02:24:45.610 --> 02:24:47.045
TO TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO SORT

02:24:47.111 --> 02:24:48.846
THESE APPLICATIONS WITHOUT THAT.

02:24:48.913 --> 02:24:51.082
WELL LET ME SAY ARE BY THE WAY --

02:24:51.149 --> 02:24:53.918
WE HAVE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED TWENTY

02:24:53.985 --> 02:24:55.553
THOUSAND APPLICANTS THAT'S EIGHT

02:24:55.620 --> 02:24:57.822
HUNDRED AND EIGHTY APPLICATIONS

02:24:57.889 --> 02:25:00.024
ACTION CELL SORTING THROUGH THAT

02:25:00.091 --> 02:25:01.926
IS A CHALLENGE --

02:25:01.993 --> 02:25:04.729
AND THE STATE EXPECTS US TO DO

02:25:04.796 --> 02:25:06.397
THIS IN A WAY --

02:25:06.464 --> 02:25:07.899
ARTIST THIS IS MY UNDERSTANDING

02:25:07.965 --> 02:25:09.667
TO DO IT THIS IN A WAY TO HAS

02:25:09.734 --> 02:25:11.002
ACADEMIC --

02:25:11.069 --> 02:25:13.104
AT A INTEGRITY IN VALUE TO IT

02:25:13.171 --> 02:25:14.906
AND THAT IS AS OBJECTIVE AS

02:25:14.972 --> 02:25:16.574
POSSIBLE --

02:25:16.641 --> 02:25:19.710
TO ARE RECOGNIZING THAT --

02:25:19.777 --> 02:25:21.546
THAT THE STAKES OF THOSE

02:25:21.612 --> 02:25:23.848
DECISIONS ARE QUITE MEANINGFUL

02:25:23.915 --> 02:25:25.383
AND THAT WE DO HAVE DATA THAT

02:25:25.450 --> 02:25:28.686
INDICATES THAT ACCESS. TO TO THE

02:25:28.753 --> 02:25:32.623
UNIVERSITY INCLUDING THE BEST OF

02:25:32.690 --> 02:25:33.925
THEM.

02:25:33.991 --> 02:25:35.359
MATTERS --

02:25:35.426 --> 02:25:36.360
UNIVERSITY ADMISSIONS DOESN'T

02:25:36.427 --> 02:25:38.362
MATTER AND THE INTEGRITY WITH

02:25:38.429 --> 02:25:38.663
WHICH THAT.

02:25:38.729 --> 02:25:41.199
IS HAPPENS MATTERS AND SO TO

02:25:41.265 --> 02:25:43.601
HAVE AN INDEPENDENT CHECK IS ONE

02:25:43.668 --> 02:25:46.170
OF THE ARGUMENTS --

02:25:46.237 --> 02:25:48.573
FOR FOR USING --

02:25:48.639 --> 02:25:51.242
THE TEST BUT YOU ALSO ARE

02:25:51.309 --> 02:25:52.677
OBVIOUSLY QUITE KNOWLEDGEABLE

02:25:52.743 --> 02:25:53.811
ABOUT THIS --

02:25:53.878 --> 02:25:55.746
THERE ARE CULTURAL AND

02:25:55.813 --> 02:25:57.315
SOCIOECONOMIC FEATURES THAT ARE

02:25:57.381 --> 02:25:59.117
ALSO LINKED TO THOSE TESTS WE

02:25:59.183 --> 02:26:00.818
HAVE DATA THAT INDICATES THAT

02:26:00.885 --> 02:26:02.753
THE SCORES ON THESE TESTS --

02:26:02.820 --> 02:26:04.388
ARE THAT THE RELATIONSHIP

02:26:04.455 --> 02:26:06.257
BETWEEN THINGS THAT AREN'T

02:26:06.324 --> 02:26:08.259
RELATED TO TO ACHIEVE THINGS

02:26:08.326 --> 02:26:10.928
LIKE OUR OUR STUDENTS FAMILY --

02:26:10.995 --> 02:26:12.630
ECONOMIC BACKGROUND THEIR

02:26:12.697 --> 02:26:14.165
EDUCATIONAL BACKGROUND THEIR

02:26:14.232 --> 02:26:15.900
THEIR RACE --

02:26:15.967 --> 02:26:17.835
IS INCREASING IN TERMS OF ITS

02:26:17.902 --> 02:26:19.337
RELATIONSHIP TO SCORES ON THAT

02:26:19.403 --> 02:26:20.905
TEST AND I THINK THERE ARE

02:26:20.972 --> 02:26:22.206
PEOPLE WHO ARE CONCERNED ABOUT

02:26:22.273 --> 02:26:23.541
THAT AS WELL.

02:26:23.608 --> 02:26:24.942
SO THESE THINGS ARE BEING

02:26:25.009 --> 02:26:26.878
EXAMINED --

02:26:26.944 --> 02:26:28.646
THEY ARE GOING TO GO THROUGH --

02:26:28.713 --> 02:26:30.982
THIS THE THE THE SCRUTINY THAT I

02:26:31.048 --> 02:26:33.317
BELIEVE THAT THE STATE EXPECTS

02:26:33.384 --> 02:26:35.520
THE ACADEMIC SENATE TO TO EXERT.

02:26:35.586 --> 02:26:38.956
AND AND AND THEN WE'LL GET A

02:26:39.023 --> 02:26:40.925
REPORT I'LL GET A REPORT AND I

02:26:40.992 --> 02:26:42.160
EXPECT --

02:26:42.226 --> 02:26:44.762
AND THEY EXPECT TO THAT GIVEN

02:26:44.829 --> 02:26:46.664
GIVEN THE THAT'LL THE LIKELY

02:26:46.731 --> 02:26:51.302
ATTENTION TO HEAR AT THAT REPORT

02:26:51.369 --> 02:26:53.037
WILL BE WELL CIRCULATED.

02:26:53.104 --> 02:26:54.172
OKAY AT THANK YOU FOR ANSWERING

02:26:54.238 --> 02:26:54.972
THAT THE QUESTION SO FAR YEAH

02:26:55.039 --> 02:26:55.640
AND IN SOME AT I KNOW WE HAVE A

02:26:55.706 --> 02:26:58.476
LOT OF INFORMATION THAT WE DON'T

02:26:58.543 --> 02:27:00.278
KNOW YET.

02:27:00.344 --> 02:27:02.313

LOOKING TO CHANCES QUESTIONS

02:27:05.583 --> 02:27:06.817
FORGET WHAT HAPPENED BUT ALSO

02:27:06.884 --> 02:27:08.920
FIGURE OUT HOW WE GO FORWARD AND

02:27:08.986 --> 02:27:10.254
PREVENT THIS FROM HAPPENING

02:27:10.321 --> 02:27:11.122
AGAIN.

02:27:11.189 --> 02:27:13.457
PROTECT THE INTEGRITY OF THE

02:27:13.524 --> 02:27:14.992

FOR THE S. A. T. TO BE PART OF A

02:27:23.334 --> 02:27:24.435
HIGH SCHOOL EXPERIENCE.

02:27:24.502 --> 02:27:26.170
BECAUSE OF A WERE PART OF THE

02:27:26.237 --> 02:27:27.672
HIGH SCHOOL EXPERIENCE LIKE I'M

02:27:27.738 --> 02:27:29.106
CONTEMPLATING.

02:27:29.173 --> 02:27:30.374
AND ALONG BEACH UNIFIED IS DOING

02:27:30.441 --> 02:27:31.776
HOW MANY SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE

02:27:31.842 --> 02:27:32.777
NOW ACROSS THE STATE WOULD

02:27:32.843 --> 02:27:34.145
INSURERS IS THAT THERE'S

02:27:34.212 --> 02:27:35.980
OVERSIGHT.

02:27:36.047 --> 02:27:36.614
IF IT'S CONDUCTED AT THE HIGH

02:27:36.681 --> 02:27:37.548
SCHOOL.

02:27:37.615 --> 02:27:39.450
THERE'S COMPLIANCE THE EQUITY

02:27:39.517 --> 02:27:40.785
PROVISIONS ARE FOLLOWED THE ID

02:27:40.851 --> 02:27:41.619
PEAS.

02:27:41.686 --> 02:27:43.120
ARE FOLLOWED AND ALSO THAT TEST

02:27:43.187 --> 02:27:45.122
PREP OCCURS BECAUSE WITH THE S.

02:27:45.189 --> 02:27:46.457
A. T. AS OPPOSED TO SOME LIKE

02:27:46.524 --> 02:27:47.692
THE S. BACK AS THAT WHICH IS

02:27:47.758 --> 02:27:49.293
THAT STATE REQUIRED TESTS.

02:27:49.360 --> 02:27:51.062
YES PACKED THE ASPECT OF MY

02:27:51.128 --> 02:27:52.763
PEERS RATHER FLOOD TOOL WITH THE

02:27:52.830 --> 02:27:55.166
SAT IS MORE OF AN ASSESSMENT SO

02:27:55.233 --> 02:27:56.067
WHAT DO I MEAN BY THAT YOU GIVE

02:27:56.133 --> 02:27:57.535
THE THE PSA.

02:27:57.602 --> 02:27:59.537
AND THE EIGHTH NINTH AND TENTH

02:27:59.604 --> 02:28:04.008
GRADE THAT'S THE PRETEST RIGHT.

02:28:04.075 --> 02:28:05.476
AND WHAT YOU CAN THEN DO.

02:28:05.543 --> 02:28:06.611
IS IDENTIFY THE ACHIEVEMENT GAPS

02:28:06.677 --> 02:28:07.311
ATTEMPT TO CLOSE THEM OVER THAT

02:28:07.378 --> 02:28:08.613
INTERIM PERIOD BEFORE THE FINAL

02:28:08.679 --> 02:28:09.614
TEST.

02:28:09.680 --> 02:28:11.382
SO AGAIN I THINK GIVING AT THE

02:28:11.449 --> 02:28:12.917
HIGH SCHOOL WOULD BE.

02:28:12.984 --> 02:28:15.219
A MUCH MORE APPROPRIATE PLACE

02:28:15.286 --> 02:28:16.654
TEST CENTERS THERE'S A LACK OF

02:28:16.721 --> 02:28:17.955
CONTROL THERE THAT KIND OF THING

02:28:18.022 --> 02:28:19.924
WE KNOW THAT WE'RE SEEING THAT

02:28:19.991 --> 02:28:20.491
RIGHT NOW THAT'S ONE OF THE

02:28:20.558 --> 02:28:22.360
REASONS WE'RE HERE --

02:28:22.426 --> 02:28:24.996
SO AGAIN I I APPRECIATE THAT CAN

02:28:25.062 --> 02:28:26.897
MAKES THE CASE THAT IT BE PART

02:28:26.964 --> 02:28:28.165
OF THE HIGH SCHOOL EXPERIENCE

02:28:28.232 --> 02:28:29.367
NOW LATER ON MIGHT WE GO TO A

02:28:29.433 --> 02:28:30.501
DIFFERENT TEST SOME OTHER SOME

02:28:30.568 --> 02:28:31.869
SOMETHING ELSE PROBABLY.

02:28:31.936 --> 02:28:33.604
BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT WE WANT TO

02:28:33.671 --> 02:28:35.106
JUST SPACE EVERY STUDENT.

02:28:35.172 --> 02:28:36.941
ON THEIR HIGH SCHOOL ON THEIR

02:28:37.008 --> 02:28:38.409
HIGH SCHOOL GRADE POINT AVERAGE

02:28:38.476 --> 02:28:38.943
I THINK IT SHOULD BE MUCH

02:28:39.010 --> 02:28:40.077
BROADER.

02:28:40.144 --> 02:28:41.045
THAN THAT BECAUSE STUDENT

02:28:41.112 --> 02:28:42.747
STUDENTS COME WITH DIFFERENT

02:28:42.813 --> 02:28:43.881
EXPERIENCES SOME HAVE TO WORK.

02:28:43.948 --> 02:28:45.683
SOME CAN'T GET THAT FOUR POINT

02:28:45.750 --> 02:28:49.020
SEVEN GPA RIGHT AND SOME SCHOOLS

02:28:49.086 --> 02:28:49.620
THE WAY THEIR MODEL MIGHT NOT

02:28:49.687 --> 02:28:51.756
ALLOW THEM. TO GET THAT FOUR

02:28:51.822 --> 02:28:53.958
POINT SEVEN GPA SO I THINK WE WE

02:28:54.025 --> 02:28:55.192
REALLY OUGHT.

02:28:55.259 --> 02:28:56.794
TO THINK I KNOW WHO WERE NOT YOU

02:28:56.861 --> 02:28:57.895
KNOW THIS IS A POLITICAL MOMENT

02:28:57.962 --> 02:28:58.963
WHETHER THIS IS A POLICY

02:28:59.030 --> 02:28:59.563
QUESTION.

02:28:59.630 --> 02:29:01.866
BEFORE IS THAT I I THINK WE NEED

02:29:01.932 --> 02:29:02.433
TO DELVE INTO MUCH MUCH MORE

02:29:02.500 --> 02:29:04.168
THOROUGHLY. TWENTY CLEAR WE'RE

02:29:04.235 --> 02:29:06.237
TALKING ABOUT A ONE TO THREE

02:29:06.304 --> 02:29:07.571
CASES AT THE UC.

02:29:07.638 --> 02:29:09.507
REALLY THE PEOPLE THAT OUGHT TO

02:29:09.573 --> 02:29:10.875
BE UP HERE TODAY ARE FROM SOME

02:29:10.941 --> 02:29:13.210

02:29:13.277 --> 02:29:13.778
ACROSS OUR STATE ACROSS OUR

02:29:13.844 --> 02:29:14.578
NATION.

02:29:14.645 --> 02:29:15.780
OKAY IT IS NOT LIKE THIS IS THE

02:29:15.846 --> 02:29:18.282
THE UC HAS BEEN THE BIG ACTOR.

02:29:18.349 --> 02:29:20.217

02:29:51.716 --> 02:29:53.150
BUT ON TOP OF THAT.

02:29:53.217 --> 02:29:54.352

AND I KNOW EVERYBODY --

02:30:22.913 --> 02:30:24.115

02:31:32.583 --> 02:31:33.984
THE INSTITUTION BUT THE VALUES

02:31:34.051 --> 02:31:37.254
THE AGREED IN VALUES THE ENTIRE.

02:31:37.321 --> 02:31:38.756
EXPERIENCE AS THE SON OF

02:31:38.823 --> 02:31:40.524
IMMIGRANTS YOU KNOW I WAS ALWAYS

02:31:40.591 --> 02:31:42.760
TOLD THAT WE HAD TO WORK HARD

02:31:42.827 --> 02:31:44.094
BUT THAT IF WE WORKED HARD WE

02:31:44.161 --> 02:31:45.496
STUDIED HARD WE COULD WE COULD

02:31:45.563 --> 02:31:46.697
GET IT.

02:31:46.764 --> 02:31:48.399
AND I THINK THAT --

02:31:48.466 --> 02:31:49.867
THIS IS SENDING THE COMPLETELY

02:31:49.934 --> 02:31:52.870
OPPOSITE MESSAGE THAT OBVIOUSLY --

02:31:52.937 --> 02:31:54.405
WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR

02:31:54.472 --> 02:31:56.974
VERY STRONG STATEMENT ON I IN

02:31:57.041 --> 02:31:58.375
FACT I WANT TO COMMEND YOU SEE

02:31:58.442 --> 02:32:00.744
IN THIS PARTICULAR INSTANCE

02:32:00.811 --> 02:32:02.246
BECAUSE ON ONE OF THE MOST

02:32:02.313 --> 02:32:03.481
COMMON COMPLAINTS ABOUT.

02:32:03.547 --> 02:32:05.082
YOU SEE WHETHER IT'S BERKELEY OR

02:32:05.149 --> 02:32:07.485
UCLA OR ANY OF THAT ANY OF THE

02:32:07.551 --> 02:32:08.752
UNIVERSITY IS HOW.

02:32:08.819 --> 02:32:10.888
DIFFICULT IT IS FOR DONORS TO

02:32:10.955 --> 02:32:11.655
GET THEIR KIDS INTO THOSE

02:32:11.722 --> 02:32:12.623
COLLEGES.

02:32:12.690 --> 02:32:14.124
I AND I KNOW SORT OF LIKE A A

02:32:14.191 --> 02:32:17.194
RUNNING JOKE BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT

02:32:17.261 --> 02:32:17.995
YOU HEAR ABOUT FROM THE VARIOUS

02:32:18.062 --> 02:32:19.697
PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS I BELIEVE

02:32:19.763 --> 02:32:20.431
MISTER -- MY

02:32:20.498 --> 02:32:21.432
COLLEAGUE FROM LONG BEACH IS

02:32:21.499 --> 02:32:22.867
SORT OF REFERRING.

02:32:22.933 --> 02:32:24.635
TO IS A REALLY APPLAUD THE

02:32:24.702 --> 02:32:27.805
UNIVERSITY UP FOR THAT I KNOW

02:32:27.872 --> 02:32:29.673
IT'S CHALLENGING AT TIMES WERE

02:32:29.740 --> 02:32:31.742
WE WE JUST HAD A VERY.

02:32:31.809 --> 02:32:32.943
LONG DISCUSSION ABOUT ENROLLMENT

02:32:33.010 --> 02:32:34.211
AND HOW COMPETITIVE ENROLLMENT

02:32:34.278 --> 02:32:35.880
IS AND HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO

02:32:35.946 --> 02:32:38.382
GET IN AND I KNOW THAT IT'S EASY.

02:32:38.449 --> 02:32:40.284
TO LOOK AT BENDING THOSE --

02:32:40.351 --> 02:32:42.286
THOSE RULES THAT APPLY TO THE

02:32:42.353 --> 02:32:44.221
UNIVERSITY FOR REALLY NOT GOING

02:32:44.288 --> 02:32:46.357
DOWN THAT PATH AND AND NOT

02:32:46.423 --> 02:32:48.492
BENDING THOSE RULES REALLY --

02:32:48.559 --> 02:32:51.529
STAYING BY A VERY STRINGENT --

02:32:51.595 --> 02:32:53.230
VERY CHALLENGING ADMISSIONS

02:32:53.297 --> 02:32:57.601
ENROLLMENT PROCESS ON MY AND MY

02:32:57.668 --> 02:32:58.936
QUESTION IS TO GO BACK TO JUST

02:32:59.003 --> 02:32:59.904
THE CATEGORY --

02:32:59.970 --> 02:33:01.138
THAT THE CHAIR WAS TALKING ABOUT

02:33:01.205 --> 02:33:02.406
WHICH IS.

02:33:02.473 --> 02:33:03.507
WHAT HOW HOW DO YOU CALL THAT

02:33:03.574 --> 02:33:05.409
CATEGORY WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE

02:33:05.476 --> 02:33:07.511
IT WAS CALLED SPECIAL ACTION?

02:33:07.578 --> 02:33:08.846
BUT WHAT WHAT'S IT CALLED NOW IN

02:33:08.913 --> 02:33:10.447
A MISSION BY EXCEPTION ADMISSION

02:33:10.514 --> 02:33:11.015
BY ACCEPTING COULD CAUSE SO

02:33:11.081 --> 02:33:12.116
COULD YOU WALK THE COMMITTEE

02:33:12.182 --> 02:33:14.451
THROUGH HOW.

02:33:14.518 --> 02:33:15.653
HOW THAT EXCEPTION IS IS DONE?

02:33:15.719 --> 02:33:17.187
HOW IS IT DIFFERENT FROM THE

02:33:17.254 --> 02:33:18.989
TRADITIONAL ENROLLMENT --

02:33:19.056 --> 02:33:20.658
DIGNITY MISSIONS PROCESS WHERE

02:33:20.724 --> 02:33:21.892
YOU LOOK AT THE GRADES TEST

02:33:21.959 --> 02:33:23.627
SCORES READ THE ESSAYS AND THEN.

02:33:23.694 --> 02:33:25.396
THERE THERE'S SOME SCORE IN THIS

02:33:25.462 --> 02:33:26.597
MARKET SEGMENT I DID BRING

02:33:26.664 --> 02:33:28.999
ACTUALLY DID DIRECTOR OF OF

02:33:29.066 --> 02:33:30.434
ADMISSION WONDERFUL GO TO

02:33:30.501 --> 02:33:36.440
DETAILS --

02:33:36.507 --> 02:33:39.577
DOCTOR HARM ME IAN WILL BUT YOU

02:33:39.643 --> 02:33:41.111
WANT MORE DETAIL AND SHE SHE CAN

02:33:41.178 --> 02:33:42.913
TELL.

02:33:42.980 --> 02:33:44.148
HI GOOD AFTERNOON OR IT'S THE

02:33:44.214 --> 02:33:45.783
MORNING I SUPPOSE --

02:33:45.849 --> 02:33:47.651
SO ADMISSION BY EXCEPTION IS TO

02:33:47.718 --> 02:33:49.787
USE FOR STUDENTS WHO DON'T MEET

02:33:49.853 --> 02:33:51.455
OUR MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR

02:33:51.522 --> 02:33:52.856
ADMISSION SO ON THE SCHOLARSHIP

02:33:52.923 --> 02:33:54.592
SIDE SO WHETHER THEY DIDN'T TAKE

02:33:54.658 --> 02:33:56.627
THE RIGHT SAT BECAUSE YOU KNOW

02:33:56.694 --> 02:33:57.795
WE HAVE THE S. A. T..

02:33:57.861 --> 02:33:59.663
ON ITS OWN AND THEN THERE'S THE

02:33:59.730 --> 02:34:01.665
OPTIONAL ESSAY WHICH WE REQUIRE

02:34:01.732 --> 02:34:03.267
AS PART OF THEIR CURRENT

02:34:03.334 --> 02:34:04.101
REQUIREMENTS FOR FRESHMAN

02:34:04.168 --> 02:34:05.669
ADMISSION --

02:34:05.736 --> 02:34:06.670
THAT TAKING THE FIFTEEN A THREE

02:34:06.737 --> 02:34:08.872
G. WE FIND THAT STUDENTS --

02:34:08.939 --> 02:34:10.908
MAY NOT DEPENDING ON WHERE THEY

02:34:10.975 --> 02:34:13.978
GO TO SCHOOL MAY NOT HAVE A FULL.

02:34:14.044 --> 02:34:15.112
ACCESS TO ALL THE A THROUGH G.

02:34:15.179 --> 02:34:16.280
ESPECIALLY SOMETIMES IN THE

02:34:16.347 --> 02:34:17.681
AREAS OF THE VISUAL AND

02:34:17.748 --> 02:34:19.249
PERFORMING ARTS REQUIREMENT THAT

02:34:19.316 --> 02:34:20.217
WE HAVE.

02:34:20.284 --> 02:34:21.585
STUDENTS WHO ARE HOME SCHOOLED

02:34:21.652 --> 02:34:23.087
AS WAS MENTIONED EARLIERSO

02:34:23.153 --> 02:34:25.089
ANYONE WHO IS --

02:34:25.155 --> 02:34:28.592
A CAMPUS IS WANTING TO ADMIT --

02:34:28.659 --> 02:34:30.094
BUT DOESN'T QUITE MEET EVERY SEE

02:34:30.160 --> 02:34:31.829
CAN'T CHECK OFF EVERY BOX FOR

02:34:31.895 --> 02:34:33.163
OUR MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS WOULD

02:34:33.230 --> 02:34:35.899
THEN BE SUBMITTED FOR REVIEW --

02:34:35.966 --> 02:34:37.334
TO AND WHETHER TO COMMITTEE OR

02:34:37.401 --> 02:34:39.603
OF OR SOME OTHER REVIEW BODY

02:34:39.670 --> 02:34:41.905
DEPENDING ON THE CAMPUS IS THEN

02:34:41.972 --> 02:34:43.273
LOOKING TO SEE --

02:34:43.340 --> 02:34:45.109
WHETHER THEY HAVE IN OUR WHOLE

02:34:45.175 --> 02:34:46.377
COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW.

02:34:46.443 --> 02:34:49.880
IT IS MORE THAN THE THREE I

02:34:49.947 --> 02:34:51.281
MENTIONED EARLIER GPA TEST

02:34:51.348 --> 02:34:53.617
SCORES AND THE RESPONSES TO WHAT

02:34:53.684 --> 02:34:55.386
WE CALL THE PERSONAL INSIGHT

02:34:55.452 --> 02:34:57.488
QUESTIONS BUT FOURTEEN CRITERIA

02:34:57.554 --> 02:34:59.757
ACTUALLY WHETHER IT'S SPECIAL

02:34:59.823 --> 02:35:01.525
TALENTS OUR WHETHER THEY'RE

02:35:01.592 --> 02:35:04.128
COMING FROM A RURAL AREA A PLACE

02:35:04.194 --> 02:35:05.429
WHERE -- WE

02:35:05.496 --> 02:35:07.398
ARE TRYING.

02:35:07.464 --> 02:35:08.699
TO BRING MORE STUDENTS IN FROM

02:35:08.766 --> 02:35:10.834
THROUGHOUT THE STATE OR A NUMBER

02:35:10.901 --> 02:35:12.102
OF OTHER FACTORS THAT ARE

02:35:12.169 --> 02:35:13.470
CONSIDERED IN ADMISSIONS IF THEY

02:35:13.537 --> 02:35:15.572
MEET ALL OF THOSE AND THE CAMPUS

02:35:15.639 --> 02:35:16.807
DOESN'T WANT TO OFFER.

02:35:16.874 --> 02:35:19.243
A PLACE ON THE CAMPUS THEN THAT

02:35:19.309 --> 02:35:22.279
STUDENT WOULD BE LABELED OR

02:35:22.346 --> 02:35:24.081
PROVIDED ADMISSION BY EXCEPTION

02:35:24.148 --> 02:35:25.983
BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T MEET THAT

02:35:26.050 --> 02:35:27.017
MINIMUM CRITERIA.

02:35:27.084 --> 02:35:28.152
SO SO SO SOUNDS LIKE SOME OF THE

02:35:28.218 --> 02:35:29.820
MAJOR CATEGORIES THAT WOULD

02:35:29.887 --> 02:35:32.256
WOULD QUALIFY FOR ADMISSIONS BY

02:35:32.322 --> 02:35:34.625
EXCEPTION OUR STUDENTS WHO ARE

02:35:34.692 --> 02:35:36.527
NOT TRADITIONALLY YOU SEE

02:35:36.593 --> 02:35:37.728
ELIGIBLE.

02:35:37.795 --> 02:35:38.729
THAT SUCH SUITS ARE NOT

02:35:38.796 --> 02:35:40.531
TRADITIONALLY USED ELIGIBLE WHO

02:35:40.597 --> 02:35:42.099
MAYBE ATHLETES MAY BE HOME

02:35:42.166 --> 02:35:43.000
SCHOOLED.

02:35:43.067 --> 02:35:45.602
ME REPRESENTS AND GEOGRAPHIC

02:35:45.669 --> 02:35:46.270
DIVERSITY HAS BEEN A MONTH MUCH

02:35:46.336 --> 02:35:46.537
OF THAT.

02:35:46.603 --> 02:35:48.605
CONCENTRATION MISSIONS HAPPENS

02:35:48.672 --> 02:35:50.274
IN THE URBAN OR THOUGHT OR THAT

02:35:50.340 --> 02:35:52.376
MORE COASTAL PART OF THE STATE.

02:35:52.443 --> 02:35:53.744
SO IS THAT CORRECT IS THAT FAIR

02:35:53.811 --> 02:35:56.113
I DO DONORS OR ALUMNI ARE AS AS

02:35:56.180 --> 02:35:57.614
AT A CATEGORY WITHIN THAT

02:35:57.681 --> 02:36:03.487
ADMISSIONS BY EXCEPTION.

02:36:03.554 --> 02:36:05.255
NO IT IS NOT WE HAVE.

02:36:05.322 --> 02:36:06.490
TO SO THE HEAD OF THE ALUMNI

02:36:06.557 --> 02:36:06.924
ASSOCIATIONS CAN'T.

02:36:06.990 --> 02:36:08.225
CAN'T CALL YOU OR CALL THE

02:36:08.292 --> 02:36:08.826
DIFFERENT UNIVERSITIES AND SAY

02:36:08.892 --> 02:36:09.660
HEY WE YOU KNOW WE HAVE THESE

02:36:09.727 --> 02:36:11.562
FABULOUS.

02:36:11.628 --> 02:36:13.130
BOOSTERS AND ALUMNI IN THE

02:36:13.197 --> 02:36:13.697
SYSTEM THIS IS THAT THIS IS

02:36:13.764 --> 02:36:15.432
SOMEONE THAT WE NEED YOU TO

02:36:15.499 --> 02:36:15.866
ADMIT BY EXCEPTION.

02:36:15.933 --> 02:36:16.900
ALL THEY CAN DO THAT BUT WE

02:36:16.967 --> 02:36:20.804
WOULD NOT ADMIT ANYONE IF THEY

02:36:20.871 --> 02:36:23.474
DONATED BUILDING OR WHAT IF THEY

02:36:23.540 --> 02:36:26.143
YOU KNOW AND OUR CHAIR. TO MY

02:36:26.210 --> 02:36:27.845
KNOWLEDGE THAT DOESN'T OCCUR.

02:36:27.911 --> 02:36:30.547
IN -- HOW

02:36:30.614 --> 02:36:32.382
CONFIDENT ARE YOU THAT THIS

02:36:32.449 --> 02:36:35.219
ADMISSIONS THAT YOUR POLICIES AT

02:36:35.285 --> 02:36:36.086
THE?

02:36:36.153 --> 02:36:37.488
LEVEL IS BEING IMPLEMENTED AT

02:36:37.554 --> 02:36:40.924
EACH OF THE TEN CAMPUS.

02:36:40.991 --> 02:36:41.692
HOW DO HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU

02:36:41.759 --> 02:36:43.160
WISH TO ASSURE THAT IS CURRENT

02:36:43.227 --> 02:36:44.862
YEAH AT THIS TIME I'M FAIRLY

02:36:44.928 --> 02:36:45.395
CONFIDENT --

02:36:45.462 --> 02:36:47.164
AS PROPOSED BROWN HAD MENTIONED

02:36:47.231 --> 02:36:49.166
THAT THE POLICY DOES ALLOW FOR

02:36:49.233 --> 02:36:52.035
UP 26% OF THE ENROLLED CLASS AND

02:36:52.102 --> 02:36:53.403
OUR CAMPUSES ARE SHOWING THAT

02:36:53.470 --> 02:36:55.506
THEY ARE ACTUALLY ADMITTING IN

02:36:55.572 --> 02:36:57.274
ROLLING FAR LESS THAN --

02:36:57.341 --> 02:37:00.344
THAT CLOSER 2122% DEPENDING ON

02:37:00.410 --> 02:37:02.613
THE CAMPUS AND THE AUDIT THAT

02:37:02.679 --> 02:37:07.684
WILL BE UNDERGONE WALSH.

02:37:07.751 --> 02:37:11.088
HOPEFULLY --

02:37:11.155 --> 02:37:13.123
WHY IS IT WHY IS IT SO LOW I

02:37:13.190 --> 02:37:14.625
MEAN YOU YOU THAT THIS IS A KID

02:37:14.691 --> 02:37:15.292
THIS IS AN AREA WHERE THE

02:37:15.359 --> 02:37:16.727
CAMPUSES HAVE --

02:37:16.794 --> 02:37:18.562
SURMOUNT DISCRETION WHY IS IT

02:37:18.629 --> 02:37:19.696
ONLY 2% YOU THINK VERSUS SIX

02:37:19.763 --> 02:37:20.264
BECAUSE THE DEMAND FOR THE

02:37:20.330 --> 02:37:21.732
STUDENTS WHO ARE ACTUALLY

02:37:21.799 --> 02:37:22.733
ELIGIBLE IS SO HIGH.

02:37:22.800 --> 02:37:23.600
SO SO YOU COULD BASICALLY FILL

02:37:23.667 --> 02:37:26.470
UP YOUR ENTIRE CLASS WITH --

02:37:26.537 --> 02:37:28.772
ALL YOU SEE ELIGIBLE STUDENTS SO

02:37:28.839 --> 02:37:30.974
IT'S YOU KNOW YOU REALLY HAVE TO

02:37:31.041 --> 02:37:32.342
HAVE SOMETHING FAIRLY

02:37:32.409 --> 02:37:34.611
EXTRAORDINARY TO BE ADMITTED BY

02:37:34.678 --> 02:37:35.879
EXCEPTION ACT.

02:37:35.946 --> 02:37:38.482
THAT'S CORRECT OKAY SO --

02:37:38.549 --> 02:37:39.082
GOING TO CALL BACK TO MISTER

02:37:39.149 --> 02:37:41.051
BUSTAMANTE IN TERMS OF YOUR

02:37:41.118 --> 02:37:42.052
AUDIT CAN YOU CAN JUST KIND OF

02:37:42.119 --> 02:37:47.391
THE GIVE US THE THE SCOPE HOW

02:37:47.457 --> 02:37:50.027
HOW BROAD THAT ON IT WILL TERMS

THE ATHLETIC SIDE TO EXAMINE

02:38:02.105 --> 02:38:03.540
WHAT THE PROCESSES ARE.

02:38:03.607 --> 02:38:05.776
WILL BE IS PROBABLY TO WEAR

02:38:05.843 --> 02:38:07.411
RIGHT NOW --

02:38:07.477 --> 02:38:08.545
DESIGNING DESIGNING THE AUDIT

02:38:08.612 --> 02:38:09.847
AND WHAT OUR APPROACH IS GOING

02:38:09.913 --> 02:38:11.014
TO BE.

02:38:11.081 --> 02:38:12.850
FOR MAPPING OUT THE EXISTING

02:38:12.916 --> 02:38:14.785
PROCESS SEASON LOOKING AT THE

02:38:14.852 --> 02:38:16.186
POLICIES AND PROTOCOLS THE OTHER

02:38:16.253 --> 02:38:17.955
ITEMS THAT ARE IN PLACE TO

02:38:18.021 --> 02:38:19.423
IDENTIFY THE HIGH RISK AREAS.

02:38:19.489 --> 02:38:21.592
CLEARLY THE EXCEPTION AREA WOULD

02:38:21.658 --> 02:38:22.659
BE ONE THAT WE WITH A FOCUS IN

02:38:22.726 --> 02:38:24.161
ON BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT WE

02:38:24.228 --> 02:38:25.562
IDENTIFY ANYTHING ELSE AS WE MAP

02:38:25.629 --> 02:38:27.231
OUT THE PROCESS SEES IT EACH OF

02:38:27.297 --> 02:38:28.365
THE CAMPUSES.

02:38:28.432 --> 02:38:29.933
WE WILL UNDOUBTEDLY FIND OTHER

02:38:30.000 --> 02:38:33.237
AREAS THAT WE THINK ARE WORTHY

02:38:33.303 --> 02:38:34.404
OF AUDIT.

02:38:34.471 --> 02:38:37.641
AND AS THE INDEPENDENT A FORM.

02:38:37.708 --> 02:38:39.376
OF FOR THE REGION'S IMAGE AND IN

02:38:39.443 --> 02:38:40.544
THE CAPACITY TO VERIFY WHAT IS

02:38:40.611 --> 02:38:41.578
ACTUALLY UNDERGOING.

02:38:41.645 --> 02:38:43.313
WE WILL LOOK AT THE HERE THE

02:38:43.380 --> 02:38:44.982
OPERATION SIDE AND HOW THEY

02:38:45.048 --> 02:38:46.283
ACTUALLY PERFORM SOME OF THOSE

02:38:46.350 --> 02:38:47.985
SPOT CHECKS. TO SEE IF THOSE

02:38:48.051 --> 02:38:50.587
BEING DONE IN THE WAY AS

02:38:50.654 --> 02:38:51.955
DESCRIBED IN INTENDED BY POLICY.

02:38:52.022 --> 02:38:53.557
THE WILL NOT BE CONFINING OUR

02:38:53.624 --> 02:38:54.791
ANALYSIS TO JUST THAT SO IF WE

02:38:54.858 --> 02:38:56.827
SEE THINGS THAT COME UP.

02:38:56.894 --> 02:38:58.528
WE WILL BE --

02:38:58.595 --> 02:38:59.663
DRILLING DOWN ON THOSE

02:38:59.730 --> 02:39:01.298
ACCORDINGLY --

02:39:01.365 --> 02:39:04.001
AND THAT WOULD YOU DESPITE THOSE

02:39:04.067 --> 02:39:05.569
WHEN WE MATH OUT THE EXISTING

02:39:05.636 --> 02:39:07.771
PROCESS SEES IDENTIFY POTENTIAL

02:39:07.838 --> 02:39:09.973
STRUCTURAL ISSUES FOR OTHER

02:39:10.040 --> 02:39:10.908
ISSUES THAT --

02:39:10.974 --> 02:39:12.276
MAY PERCENT SOME MANAGEMENT

02:39:12.342 --> 02:39:13.477
CORRECTIVE ACTIONS.

02:39:13.543 --> 02:39:15.212
I'M HOPEFUL THAT THAT'LL BE DONE

02:39:15.279 --> 02:39:17.381
IN THE FIRST COUPLE MONTHSGREAT.

02:39:17.447 --> 02:39:18.782
AND MIKE MY COLLEAGUE --

02:39:18.849 --> 02:39:20.918
FROM LONG BEACH SORT OF ALLUDED

02:39:20.984 --> 02:39:25.856
TO THIS BUT IF --

02:39:25.923 --> 02:39:27.591
IF IF IT.

02:39:27.658 --> 02:39:29.393
NHIáU YOUR INSTITUTIONS THAT

02:39:29.459 --> 02:39:30.627
RECEIVE CAL GRANT.

02:39:30.694 --> 02:39:31.929
WERE FORBIDDEN TO GIVE

02:39:31.995 --> 02:39:34.564
PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT --

02:39:34.631 --> 02:39:36.099
TO DONORS AND ALUMNI THAT THAT

02:39:36.166 --> 02:39:37.301
SOUNDS LIKE IT DOESN'T IT WOULD

02:39:37.367 --> 02:39:38.936
NOT IMPACT THE UNIVERSITY

02:39:39.002 --> 02:39:40.570
CALIFORNIA IS OUT OF IS THAT A

02:39:40.637 --> 02:39:46.543
FAIR STATEMENT --

02:39:46.610 --> 02:39:47.277
AND THEN --

02:39:47.344 --> 02:39:48.478
JUST JUST LAST I'M JUST AGAIN

02:39:48.545 --> 02:39:50.881
URGE IS IT SEEMS LIKE --

02:39:50.948 --> 02:39:51.581
AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ARE

02:39:51.648 --> 02:39:53.150
PURPOSELY VERY THOUGHTFULLY HAS

02:39:53.216 --> 02:39:54.618
KEPT THIS CATEGORY

02:39:54.685 --> 02:39:56.787
EXTRAORDINARILY SMALL GIVEN THE

02:39:56.853 --> 02:39:58.789
EVEN EVEN DESPITE THE HUGE

02:39:58.855 --> 02:40:01.992
DEMAND FOR ACCESS TO TO ALL YOUR

02:40:02.059 --> 02:40:03.226
ELITE INSTITUTIONS.

02:40:03.293 --> 02:40:05.929
A REALLY WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO

02:40:05.996 --> 02:40:07.698
STAY THE COURSE APPRECIATE THE

02:40:07.764 --> 02:40:09.866
VERY AGGRESSIVE ACTION --

02:40:09.933 --> 02:40:11.768
I GUESS SORRY MY LAST QUESTION --

02:40:11.835 --> 02:40:14.638
I FORGOT TO ASK EARLIER IS --

02:40:14.705 --> 02:40:17.541
IN REGARDS TO THE THERE ARE

02:40:17.607 --> 02:40:20.310
CURRENTLY ENROLLED FOR RECEIVED

02:40:20.377 --> 02:40:22.245
IT TOO GREEDY --

02:40:22.312 --> 02:40:24.681
UNDER THESE FALSE PRETENSES WHAT

02:40:24.748 --> 02:40:30.420
IS THE ACTION THAT WILL BE TAKEN --

02:40:30.487 --> 02:40:32.622
WE'LL WE'LL HAVE TO REVIEW THAT

02:40:32.689 --> 02:40:34.024
ARE.

02:40:34.091 --> 02:40:34.992
THIS IS THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT

02:40:35.058 --> 02:40:36.827
WE ARE THINKING ABOUT --

02:40:36.893 --> 02:40:39.663
WOULD BE ENGAGE OUR WITH THAT

02:40:39.730 --> 02:40:41.064
WITH THE CHANCES AND THE

02:40:41.131 --> 02:40:45.569
ACADEMIC SENATE ON THOSE ISSUES --

02:40:45.635 --> 02:40:50.140
WE'RE WE'RE STILL KIND OF AS IN

02:40:50.207 --> 02:40:51.942
AIDING TO THE PROPER --

02:40:52.009 --> 02:40:52.843
WHEN WE IDENTIFY BUT WE HAVE TO

02:40:52.909 --> 02:40:54.177
ANTICIPATE WHAT WE DO ABOUT THAT

02:40:54.244 --> 02:40:55.579
AND I CAN TELL YOU AT LEAST

02:40:55.645 --> 02:40:57.948
RIGHT NOW?

02:40:58.015 --> 02:41:00.417
MOUTH ABOUT ABOUT THAT KIND OF

02:41:00.484 --> 02:41:03.253
SITUATION SO.

02:41:03.320 --> 02:41:05.022
SO AT SIZE A AS A FORMER

02:41:05.088 --> 02:41:06.223
BERKELEY LET MY HATE TO EVER YOU

02:41:06.289 --> 02:41:10.494
STANFORD AS AN EXAMPLE --

02:41:10.560 --> 02:41:11.294
I'M I'M GONNA GO THERE TODAY

02:41:11.361 --> 02:41:14.664
BECAUSE IN CONVERSATION --

02:41:14.731 --> 02:41:16.400
ROLE --

02:41:16.466 --> 02:41:19.069
IT'LL A CONVERSATION I I COME TO

02:41:19.136 --> 02:41:21.071
UNDERSTAND THAT SOMETHING.

02:41:21.138 --> 02:41:22.472
SIMILAR HAD JUST HAD A AND A

02:41:22.539 --> 02:41:23.573
STANFORD --

02:41:23.640 --> 02:41:27.611
TO STAND FOR STUDENTS AND THAT

02:41:27.677 --> 02:41:31.281
AGAIN THE THE WORD MINUTE UNDER

02:41:31.348 --> 02:41:32.482
FALSE PRETENSES.

02:41:32.549 --> 02:41:34.851
ON THAT THEIR DEGREE WAS REVOKED

02:41:34.918 --> 02:41:36.086
AND SO I THINK THAT THAT WOULD

02:41:36.153 --> 02:41:37.287
SEEM TO BE THE APPROPRIATE

02:41:37.354 --> 02:41:38.288
ACTION FOR ANYBODY WHO'S

02:41:38.355 --> 02:41:40.223
COMPLETED THEIR DEGREE AND I

02:41:40.290 --> 02:41:41.792
WOULD REALLY URGE.

02:41:41.858 --> 02:41:45.562
THE THE UNIVERSITY TO EXPEL THE

02:41:45.629 --> 02:41:47.597
CURRENT STUDENTS WHO ARE.

02:41:47.664 --> 02:41:49.299
CURRENTLY IN ENROLLMENT AND AS

02:41:49.366 --> 02:41:51.635
WELL AS TO RESCIND THE DEGREES I

02:41:51.701 --> 02:41:52.869
THINK -- I

02:41:52.936 --> 02:41:54.171
WOULD HOPE THAT THAT DECISION

02:41:54.237 --> 02:41:56.473
COMES VERY SWIFTLY AND VERY

02:41:56.540 --> 02:41:57.274
QUICKLY.

02:41:57.340 --> 02:41:59.142
SO THAT THERE CAN BE A VERY

02:41:59.209 --> 02:42:01.912
STRONG DISINCENTIVE BIT BECAUSE

02:42:01.978 --> 02:42:02.612
AGAIN.

02:42:02.679 --> 02:42:05.549
IF IF YOU CAN CHEAT THE SYSTEM

02:42:05.615 --> 02:42:07.117
AND GET YOUR DEGREE.

02:42:07.184 --> 02:42:08.118
NO ONE'S GONNA NO ONE'S GONNA

02:42:08.185 --> 02:42:09.152
KNOW ON THEIR RESUME THAT

02:42:09.219 --> 02:42:09.453
[inaudible]

02:42:09.519 --> 02:42:11.088
THIS DEGREES.

02:42:11.154 --> 02:42:13.123
NOT VALID OR THAT THE GREEDY --

02:42:13.190 --> 02:42:14.558
FOR WHATEVER REASON THEIR YOU

02:42:14.624 --> 02:42:15.959
KNOW THEIR PARENTS WERE.

02:42:16.026 --> 02:42:16.927
SORT OF INDICATED IN THIS

02:42:16.993 --> 02:42:18.695
SCANDAL LESS THEY THEY DO SOME

02:42:18.762 --> 02:42:20.630
DEEPER RESEARCH I THINK THE

02:42:20.697 --> 02:42:22.032
UNIVERSITY HAS TO TAKE SOME

02:42:22.099 --> 02:42:24.000
EXTRAORDINARILY STRONG ACTION.

02:42:24.067 --> 02:42:26.770
ON TO EXPEL EXPELLED THE

02:42:26.837 --> 02:42:27.737
STUDENTS TO ROUTE YOU KNOW TAKE

02:42:27.804 --> 02:42:29.206
BACK THOSE DEGREES BECAUSE

02:42:29.272 --> 02:42:30.273
OTHERWISE --

02:42:30.340 --> 02:42:33.510
WHAT'S WHAT IS THE DISINCENTIVE

02:42:33.577 --> 02:42:35.278
FOR DOING THIS CHEATING FRAUD

02:42:35.345 --> 02:42:37.747
DECEIT SHOULD NOT BE REWARDED

02:42:37.814 --> 02:42:40.517
ABSOLUTE AND AND I THINK IT'S

02:42:40.584 --> 02:42:43.253
IMPORTANT THAT WHATEVER THAT ALL

02:42:43.320 --> 02:42:46.556
THE CAMPUSES ARE HARMONIZED

02:42:46.623 --> 02:42:47.224
TURNED TO HOW THEY DO.

02:42:47.290 --> 02:42:48.291
SO SO HOUSE HOW SOON CAN WE

02:42:48.358 --> 02:42:50.127
EXPECT SOME SORT OF ANNOUNCEMENT

02:42:50.193 --> 02:42:51.261
REGARDING WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN

02:42:51.328 --> 02:42:53.730
WITH WITH THE STUDENTS THAT WE

02:42:53.797 --> 02:42:57.334
DO ARE AWARE OF WELL I'M A PART

02:42:57.400 --> 02:42:58.235
OF PART OF IT.

02:42:58.301 --> 02:42:59.703
IT DEPENDS ON A LOT OF THESE

02:42:59.769 --> 02:43:01.338
INVESTIGATIONS ARE TAKING PLACE

02:43:01.404 --> 02:43:02.906
WE DO KNOW THAT THE CAMPUS IS

02:43:02.973 --> 02:43:04.541
THEMSELVES.

02:43:04.608 --> 02:43:05.742
INDEPENDENT OF WHAT ALEX'S.

02:43:05.809 --> 02:43:07.144
THE CAMPUS IS THEMSELVES ARE

02:43:07.210 --> 02:43:08.512
DOING THEIR OWN --

02:43:08.578 --> 02:43:10.213
REFUSE -- TO

02:43:10.280 --> 02:43:11.848
AND WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WILL BE

02:43:11.915 --> 02:43:13.483
ON COVER --

02:43:13.550 --> 02:43:16.153
OUR AND SO RIGHT NOW WHAT WE ARE

02:43:16.219 --> 02:43:17.320
GOING TO HAVE TO DO.

02:43:17.387 --> 02:43:18.588
AND YOUR QUESTION ACTUALLY

02:43:18.655 --> 02:43:20.423
SUGGESTS THIS THAT WE ACTUALLY

02:43:20.490 --> 02:43:23.426
ANTICIPATE WHAT WE MIGHT FINE.

02:43:23.493 --> 02:43:26.296
AND THEN I AND ANY WE MAY NOT

02:43:26.363 --> 02:43:27.864
FIND BUT IF WE DO WHAT IS THE

02:43:27.931 --> 02:43:29.166
APPROPRIATE COURSE OF THAT BUT

02:43:29.232 --> 02:43:31.768
YOU HAVE A THE STUDENT A

02:43:31.835 --> 02:43:35.272
GRADUATE FROM BERKELEY THE EXACT

02:43:35.338 --> 02:43:37.807
I BELIEVE YOU HAVE TO SEE SO YOU

02:43:37.874 --> 02:43:39.876
DO HAVE.

02:43:39.943 --> 02:43:41.745
THREE INDIVIDUALS I DON'T KNOW

02:43:41.811 --> 02:43:43.046
THE NATURE OF THE WRONGDOING

02:43:43.113 --> 02:43:44.414
ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE

02:43:44.481 --> 02:43:45.415
INDIVIDUALS I NOTE THOSE

02:43:45.482 --> 02:43:47.484
INDIVIDUALS HAVE BEEN IMPLICATED

02:43:47.551 --> 02:43:49.186
I KNOW THEY ARE SUBJECT. TO TO

02:43:49.252 --> 02:43:52.189
INVESTIGATE OF PROCESS THESE --

02:43:52.255 --> 02:43:54.824
AND SO IT'S IT'S HARD TO ADDRESS

02:43:54.891 --> 02:43:56.927
THOSE INDIVIDUALS BUT WHAT WE

02:43:56.993 --> 02:43:57.460
CAN DO.

02:43:57.527 --> 02:44:01.865
AS OUR ADDRESS LISTED

02:44:01.932 --> 02:44:03.767
CIRCUMSTANCE OF IF IT WERE TO BE

02:44:03.833 --> 02:44:07.304
FOUND THAT SUCH INDIVIDUALS

02:44:07.370 --> 02:44:09.673
WHETHER IT'S THEM AS SOMEBODY --

02:44:09.739 --> 02:44:11.308
GOT THEIR DEGREE THROUGH FROST --

02:44:11.374 --> 02:44:13.977
INFORMATION WHAT IS OUR RESPONSE

02:44:14.044 --> 02:44:15.412
SEP SO HOW SOON DO YOU

02:44:15.478 --> 02:44:16.513
ANTICIPATE FINISHING THIS

02:44:16.580 --> 02:44:21.051
INVESTIGATION REGARDING THE

02:44:21.117 --> 02:44:21.685
THREE STUDENTS THAT HAVE BEEN IN

02:44:21.751 --> 02:44:23.887
THE PRESS.

02:44:23.954 --> 02:44:24.454
I WISH I COULD GIVE YOU AN

02:44:24.521 --> 02:44:25.222
ANSWER TO THAT THERE'S A LOT OF

02:44:25.288 --> 02:44:26.323
VARIABLES RIGHT NOW I THINK

02:44:26.389 --> 02:44:28.024
WE'VE REACHED REACHING OUT TO

02:44:28.091 --> 02:44:29.593
THE DEPARTMENT JUSTICE NAPPY I

02:44:29.659 --> 02:44:30.060
TRY TO GET ADDITIONAL

02:44:30.126 --> 02:44:30.527
INFORMATION.

02:44:30.594 --> 02:44:31.928
SURE PROBABLY WHERE SOME OF THE

02:44:31.995 --> 02:44:36.233
INFORMATION THAT --

02:44:36.299 --> 02:44:36.833
IS GERMANE TO THESE ISSUES ARE

02:44:36.900 --> 02:44:37.934
OUTSIDE OF THE UNIVERSITY'S

02:44:38.001 --> 02:44:39.402
CONTROL TO TRYING TO GET

02:44:39.469 --> 02:44:40.704
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AND

02:44:40.770 --> 02:44:41.705
TRYING.

02:44:41.771 --> 02:44:42.772
IMPORTANTLY TO FIND IF THERE ARE

02:44:42.839 --> 02:44:44.107
OTHER PEOPLE THAT WE SHOULD BE

02:44:44.174 --> 02:44:46.643
FOCUSING ON IS A PRIORITY OF

02:44:46.710 --> 02:44:46.843
MINE.

02:44:46.910 --> 02:44:49.613
SO UNTIL I'M ABLE TO FIGURE OUT

02:44:49.679 --> 02:44:50.780
WHAT WE'RE ABLE TO GET.

02:44:50.847 --> 02:44:52.048
AND WE COOPERATE WITH THE THE

02:44:52.115 --> 02:44:53.617
THE FOR PROCRASTINATION IN THE

02:46:30.613 --> 02:46:30.847
[inaudible]

BELIEF.

02:46:33.450 --> 02:46:35.518
THAT THE SYSTEM WE CAN CALL IT

02:46:35.585 --> 02:46:37.287

02:46:37.354 --> 02:46:38.455
THANKS.

02:46:38.521 --> 02:46:40.824
FOR BUT WHAT WE'VE SEEN HERE

02:46:40.890 --> 02:46:43.026
WITH PARENTS WHO HAVE --

02:46:43.093 --> 02:46:46.196
EXCEEDINGLY MORE AMOUNT OF MONEY

02:46:46.262 --> 02:46:46.496
[inaudible]

02:46:46.563 --> 02:46:48.765
RESOURCES --

02:46:48.832 --> 02:46:51.101
EVEN TIME.

02:46:51.167 --> 02:46:55.238
ARE ABLE TO MANEUVER THE SYSTEM.

02:46:55.305 --> 02:46:56.506
LOOK FOR THE VULNERABLE

02:46:56.573 --> 02:46:58.808
ABILITIES OF THAT SYSTEM.

02:46:58.875 --> 02:47:02.245
AND AND LEVERAGE THEIR POWER.

02:47:02.312 --> 02:47:05.849
IN A WAY THAT IS COMPLETELY --

02:47:05.915 --> 02:47:09.185
INEQUITABLE WITH THE IDEA I

02:47:09.252 --> 02:47:10.887
THINK WHAT EVERYONE EXPECTS.

02:47:10.954 --> 02:47:12.856
AND I THINK THE CHAIRMAN MCCARTY

02:47:12.922 --> 02:47:15.525
THE FROM THE OUTSET WAS ABLE TO

02:47:15.592 --> 02:47:16.993
PINPOINT ONE VULNERABILITY.

02:47:17.060 --> 02:47:18.495
AND THAT WAS THE ONE WITH THE

02:47:18.561 --> 02:47:19.829
SPORTS AND I THINK THAT WAS VERY

02:47:19.896 --> 02:47:22.065
CLEAR IN THE NEWS STORIES.

02:47:22.132 --> 02:47:24.501
THAT JUST BY SAYING YOU KNOW MY

02:47:24.567 --> 02:47:26.069
SON MY DAUGHTER --

02:47:26.136 --> 02:47:30.006
IS A ROLL OR IS A WATER PULL AND

02:47:30.073 --> 02:47:32.208
THEN PROVIDE THE PICTURE --

02:47:32.275 --> 02:47:34.744
THAT THE SOCCER COACH AT UCLA

02:47:34.811 --> 02:47:37.480
WAS ABLE JUST BY HIMSELF --

02:47:37.547 --> 02:47:39.849
TO ADMIT THAT STUDENT SO.

02:47:39.916 --> 02:47:41.684
FOLKS WITH SO MUCH MONEY SO MUCH

02:47:41.751 --> 02:47:43.853
TIME.

02:47:43.920 --> 02:47:45.755
ABLE TO LOOK --

02:47:45.822 --> 02:47:46.589
FOR YOU KNOW WHERE OF THOSE

02:47:46.656 --> 02:47:48.191
POINTS WHERE THOSE POINTS WHERE

02:47:48.258 --> 02:47:48.658
THEY CAN --

02:47:48.725 --> 02:47:51.394
CHEAT --

02:47:51.461 --> 02:47:53.430
ANSWER TO GAME THE SYSTEM BUT I

02:47:53.496 --> 02:47:56.166
THINK THAT THAT SPORTS --

02:47:56.232 --> 02:47:58.034
EXAMPLE IS WHEN THAT SHOULD BE

02:47:58.101 --> 02:47:59.436
EASILY FIXED.

02:47:59.502 --> 02:48:01.070
RIGHT BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE NO

02:48:01.137 --> 02:48:02.972
ONE WAS LOOKING TO SEE A TO

02:48:03.039 --> 02:48:04.274
FOLLOW UP --

02:48:04.340 --> 02:48:05.542
WAS THAT --

02:48:05.608 --> 02:48:06.976
YOUNG MAN YOUNG.

02:48:07.043 --> 02:48:09.946
WOMAN ACTUALLY PLANE AFTER

02:48:10.013 --> 02:48:11.548
THEY'D BEEN ACCEPTED.

02:48:11.614 --> 02:48:13.116
EVEN SOMETIMES WITHOUT EVEN

02:48:13.183 --> 02:48:15.218
KNOWLEDGE OF THE KIDS THEMSELVES

02:48:15.285 --> 02:48:17.187
FOR RIDE THE THE YOUNG PERSON AT

02:48:17.253 --> 02:48:19.789
USC WHO WAS ADMITTED IN THE

02:48:19.856 --> 02:48:20.223
COUNSELOR ASTON --

02:48:20.290 --> 02:48:22.091
IF THE I I UNDERSTAND YOU DO

02:48:22.158 --> 02:48:24.060
WELL IN TRACK AND THE YOUNG MAN

02:48:24.127 --> 02:48:26.362
EXT YOU KNOW RESPONDED NO I

02:48:26.429 --> 02:48:27.564
DON'T RUN TRACK --

02:48:27.630 --> 02:48:29.332
SO THAT THAT SHOULD BE EASILY

02:48:29.399 --> 02:48:31.000
FIXED WITH MORE --

02:48:31.067 --> 02:48:33.703
SUPERVISION --

02:48:33.770 --> 02:48:36.406
BUT AGAIN IT GOES BACK TO A

02:48:36.473 --> 02:48:39.175
SYSTEM THAT PERHAPS IS BROKEN

02:48:39.242 --> 02:48:39.476
[inaudible]

02:48:39.542 --> 02:48:42.378
OF THAT.

02:48:42.445 --> 02:48:44.781
I I THINK ONE REDEEMING THING IS

02:48:44.848 --> 02:48:45.548
IS -- PRO

02:48:45.615 --> 02:48:47.183
WAS BROWN POINTED OUT THE NEWS

02:48:47.250 --> 02:48:49.085
STORIES THAT HAVE COME OUT SINCE

02:48:49.152 --> 02:48:51.421
THEN OF ALL THOSE HARD WORKING

02:48:51.488 --> 02:48:52.188
KIDS.

02:48:52.255 --> 02:48:53.990
OTHERS HARDWORKING KIDS WHO COME

02:48:54.057 --> 02:48:56.860
FROM SCHOOLS OF LESSER MEANS.

02:48:56.926 --> 02:48:58.595
OF WHO DON'T HAVE ALL THE

02:48:58.661 --> 02:49:00.330
ADVANTAGES THAT THESE OTHER

02:49:00.396 --> 02:49:03.466
FOLKS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO TO USE.

02:49:03.533 --> 02:49:06.102
CONTINUE CONTINUE TO WORK HARD

02:49:06.169 --> 02:49:08.371
CONTINUE TO DO WHAT YOU KNOW

02:49:08.438 --> 02:49:09.906
WE'VE ASKED THEM TO DO.

02:49:09.973 --> 02:49:12.709
AND HOPEFULLY MOVING FORWARD WE

02:49:12.775 --> 02:49:15.712
CAN FIND A SYSTEM THAT IS NOT.

02:49:15.778 --> 02:49:17.680
A SO EASILY --

02:49:17.747 --> 02:49:19.482
GAME.

02:49:19.549 --> 02:49:21.518
AND SO THAT THAT.

02:49:21.584 --> 02:49:23.486
YOU KNOW MAYBE I CONTINUE IN MY

02:49:23.553 --> 02:49:25.955
NAIVE HOPE THAT PEOPLE THAT HAVE

02:49:26.022 --> 02:49:27.891
SO MANY RESOURCES --

02:49:27.957 --> 02:49:29.425
WON'T HAVE SO MANY MORE

02:49:29.492 --> 02:49:32.028
ADVANTAGES IN ACCESSING WHAT WE

02:49:32.095 --> 02:49:34.797
SAY IS ESSENTIAL FOR SUCCESS IN

02:49:34.864 --> 02:49:36.132
THIS COUNTRY.

02:49:36.199 --> 02:49:38.968
AS MISTER CHANG I THINK ALLUDED

02:49:39.035 --> 02:49:41.404
TO A COMING FROM F. EMIGRANT

02:49:41.471 --> 02:49:43.940
PARENTS YOU KNOW THERE ARE.

02:49:44.007 --> 02:49:46.543
IF PERHAPS MILLIONS OF PEOPLE

02:49:46.609 --> 02:49:48.244
WHO CAME YOU KNOW WITH THE

02:49:48.311 --> 02:49:50.213
BELIEVE THAT IN THIS COUNTRY YOU

02:49:50.280 --> 02:49:52.815
CAN PROGRESS BE BY YOUR OWN

02:49:52.882 --> 02:49:56.052
MERIT BY YOUR OWN HARD WORK.

02:49:56.119 --> 02:49:57.587
I THINK IN THE LAST FEW DAYS

02:49:57.654 --> 02:49:59.322
WE'VE HAD.

02:49:59.389 --> 02:50:01.457
LOOKING AT THE DISCUSSION AGAIN

02:50:01.524 --> 02:50:02.859
ABOUT AFFIRMATIVE ACTION.

02:50:02.926 --> 02:50:04.661
AND I I WOULD SAY EVEN AT THE

02:50:04.727 --> 02:50:06.029
POINT WHERE I WAS ADMITTED TO

02:50:06.095 --> 02:50:07.697
COLLEGE.

02:50:07.764 --> 02:50:09.399
GOING BACK TO THE NINETEEN

02:50:09.465 --> 02:50:10.099
SEVENTIES.

02:50:10.166 --> 02:50:12.936
AND PEOPLE POINTING TO JOSE

02:50:13.002 --> 02:50:14.470
MEDINA.

02:50:14.537 --> 02:50:16.339
PERHAPS GOD AND IT UNFAIR

02:50:16.406 --> 02:50:18.207
ADVANTAGE BECAUSE HIS NAME WAS

02:50:18.274 --> 02:50:19.375
JOSE MEDINA.

02:50:19.442 --> 02:50:22.445
AND THAT WE REALLY DIDN'T BELONG.

02:50:22.512 --> 02:50:25.515
IN THAT INSTITUTION BECAUSE IT

02:50:25.582 --> 02:50:25.815
YOUR SKIN.

02:50:25.882 --> 02:50:27.817
WERE THAT WE WEREN'T CAPABLE OF

02:50:27.884 --> 02:50:30.320
DOING THE WORK THE ACADEMIC WORK

02:50:30.386 --> 02:50:32.255
WELL WE'VE SORT OF NOW TURNED IT.

02:50:32.322 --> 02:50:35.525
UPSIDE DOWN.

02:50:35.592 --> 02:50:36.826
YOU KNOW AND NOW WE ARE SEEING

02:50:36.893 --> 02:50:39.462
THOSE WITH SO MUCH INFLUENCE SO

02:50:39.529 --> 02:50:40.663
MUCH.

02:50:40.730 --> 02:50:41.931
BEING THE FOLKS WHO ARE BEING AN

02:50:41.998 --> 02:50:43.266
ADMITTEDLY.

02:50:43.333 --> 02:50:46.069
WRONG ADMITTED INTO UNIVERSITIES

02:50:46.135 --> 02:50:48.471
FOR THE WRONG REASONS.

02:50:48.538 --> 02:50:50.807
AND MAYBE WE SHOULD LOOK BACK.

02:50:50.873 --> 02:50:54.577
AT THOSE POLICIES THAT ALLOWED.

02:50:54.644 --> 02:50:57.747
MORE PEOPLE FROM UNREPRESENTED

02:50:57.814 --> 02:50:59.716
MINORITIESUNREPRESENTED

02:50:59.782 --> 02:51:02.552
POPULATIONS TO BE THERE BECAUSE

02:51:02.619 --> 02:51:04.520
THEY ARE THE ONES WHO CONTINUE

02:51:04.587 --> 02:51:05.755
TO WORK HARD.

02:51:05.822 --> 02:51:08.224
EVERY DAY DO WHAT WE'VE ASKED

02:51:08.291 --> 02:51:10.727
THEM TO DO WITH NOT THE BENEFIT

02:51:10.793 --> 02:51:13.563
OF SAT PREP SAYS.

02:51:13.630 --> 02:51:15.298
SOMEONE TO HELP THEM RIGHT THERE

02:51:15.365 --> 02:51:19.002
SA.

02:51:19.068 --> 02:51:20.236
WITH NO BEAU TEA --

02:51:20.303 --> 02:51:21.971
COUNSELING SERVICE BUT HAVE TO

02:51:22.038 --> 02:51:23.706
RELY ON THEIR HIGH SCHOOL

02:51:23.773 --> 02:51:26.776
COUNSELOR WHO LOOKS AT FOUR

02:51:26.843 --> 02:51:28.144
THOUSAND STUDENTS.

02:51:28.211 --> 02:51:30.513
AND HAS MAYBE TWICE. TWO TIMES

02:51:30.580 --> 02:51:32.215
IN THE YEAR A MEETING WITH THAT

02:51:32.281 --> 02:51:33.349
STUDENT.

02:51:33.416 --> 02:51:34.817
AND THEY'RE NOT PAYING THOUSANDS

02:51:34.884 --> 02:51:37.754
OF DOLLARS TO GET ADVICE.

02:51:37.820 --> 02:51:38.921
FROM YOU KNOW BECAUSE THEIR

02:51:38.988 --> 02:51:40.490
PARENTS DON'T HAVE THOUSANDS OF

02:51:40.556 --> 02:51:42.125
DOLLARS TO PAY.

02:51:42.191 --> 02:51:45.061
SO I HOPE THAT PERHAPS.

02:51:45.128 --> 02:51:47.797
WE CAN USE WHAT IS HAPPENED HERE

02:51:47.864 --> 02:51:50.333
TO RE LOOK AT THE SYSTEM THAT WE

02:51:50.400 --> 02:51:53.870
USE TO EVALUATE OUR STUDENTS.

02:51:53.936 --> 02:51:55.571
AND I CAN ONLY HOPE BECAUSE

02:51:55.638 --> 02:51:56.739
WITHOUT IT.

02:51:56.806 --> 02:51:59.108
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A LOT OF VERY --

02:51:59.175 --> 02:52:01.711
DISSATISFIED AND YOU WILL NOT

02:52:01.778 --> 02:52:03.413
HAVE WHITE WHY SHOULD YOU WORK

02:52:03.479 --> 02:52:07.650
HARD IF THE ONLY WAY. TO TO MOVE

02:52:07.717 --> 02:52:09.419
FORWARD IS BY.

02:52:09.485 --> 02:52:11.087
DOING SOMETHING THAT IS IS NOT

02:52:11.154 --> 02:52:14.390
RIGHT.

APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION.

02:52:19.228 --> 02:52:20.496
I ALSO --

02:52:20.563 --> 02:52:22.832
REFLECT A LOT ON MY EXPERIENCE

02:52:22.899 --> 02:52:24.634
AND PARTNERING WITH ADMISSIONS

02:52:24.701 --> 02:52:25.968
OFFICE AND I WANT TO ACTUALLY

02:52:26.035 --> 02:52:27.704
START OFF BY THINKING EVERY

02:52:27.770 --> 02:52:30.006
SINGLE ADMISSIONS OFFICER OUT

02:52:30.073 --> 02:52:30.740
THERE.

02:52:30.807 --> 02:52:33.943
BECAUSE WHAT IS NOT ALSO BEING

02:52:34.010 --> 02:52:34.977
INCLUDING THIS CONVERSATION IS

02:52:35.044 --> 02:52:37.780
HOW MANY DISCREPANCIES THEY DO

02:52:37.847 --> 02:52:40.950
CATCH AHEAD OF THE GAME --

02:52:41.017 --> 02:52:43.419
ONE OF MY DEAREST FRIENDS WERE

02:52:43.486 --> 02:52:46.355
AND I KNOW THE COUNTLESS HOURS

02:52:46.422 --> 02:52:47.890
THEY SPEND REVIEWING THOSE

02:52:47.957 --> 02:52:50.159
APPLICATIONS TO TRY TO CATCH IN

02:52:50.226 --> 02:52:52.595
DISCREPANCIES THINGS THAT DON'T

02:52:52.662 --> 02:52:54.063
MATCH WITH.

02:52:54.130 --> 02:52:56.232
TRANSCRIPTS WITH RECORDS AND TO

02:52:56.299 --> 02:52:57.667
ENSURE THAT THE PROCESS

02:52:57.734 --> 02:53:00.069
MAINTAINS ITS INTEGRITY I THINK --

02:53:00.136 --> 02:53:01.738
AS I'VE HEARD DESCRIBED THAT

02:53:01.804 --> 02:53:02.572
THERE IS --

02:53:02.638 --> 02:53:04.173
MULTIPLE PROCESSES FOR

02:53:04.240 --> 02:53:05.908
ADMISSIONS.

02:53:05.975 --> 02:53:07.677
MY CONCERN IS NOT SO MUCH AT

02:53:07.744 --> 02:53:10.246
WITH THE EXCEPTIONAL EGGMAN

02:53:10.313 --> 02:53:11.447
MISSIONS TO EXCEPTION BECAUSE

02:53:11.514 --> 02:53:13.149
YOU'RE STILL REQUIRED TO BE

02:53:13.216 --> 02:53:14.217
TRUTHFUL.

02:53:14.283 --> 02:53:16.119
IN THAT PROCESS --

02:53:16.185 --> 02:53:17.520
AND CERTAINLY THERE ARE PEOPLE

02:53:17.587 --> 02:53:18.721
WHO GO TO SCHOOL WITHOUT GREAT I

02:53:18.788 --> 02:53:19.822
MEAN THAT'S JUST THE REALITY OF

02:53:19.889 --> 02:53:21.324
OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM AND THE

02:53:21.390 --> 02:53:23.025
CHOICE THAT'S OUT THERE --

02:53:23.092 --> 02:53:25.361
SO I I HOPE THAT TO ADD.

02:53:25.428 --> 02:53:27.063
WE WILL CONTINUE TO EXPLORE I DO

02:53:27.130 --> 02:53:28.798
WANT TO ECHO THE COMMENTS THAT

02:53:28.865 --> 02:53:30.700
HAVE BEEN MADE THAT OF THE

02:53:30.767 --> 02:53:33.169
LIMITED INFORMATION WE KNOW SAYS

02:53:33.236 --> 02:53:35.671
FAR -- IT IS

02:53:35.738 --> 02:53:37.907
NOT OUR PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEMS --

02:53:37.974 --> 02:53:39.609
THAT RAISE THE GREATEST CONCERN

02:53:39.675 --> 02:53:40.977
AT THE MOMENT IN THE STATE OF

02:53:41.043 --> 02:53:42.445
CALIFORNIA IT IS OUR PRIVATE

02:53:42.512 --> 02:53:44.380
SCHOOL SYSTEMS --

02:53:44.447 --> 02:53:46.883
AND I A I WELCOME THE

02:53:46.949 --> 02:53:48.351
CONVERSATION IN THE HEARINGS

02:53:48.417 --> 02:53:49.619
THAT WILL COME FORWARD.

02:53:49.685 --> 02:53:51.521
AND THERE'S ALSO A GROUP OF

02:53:51.587 --> 02:53:52.622
INDIVIDUALS.

02:53:52.688 --> 02:53:54.791
IN OUR STATE THAT HAVE WORKED

02:53:54.857 --> 02:53:55.925
REALLY HARD TO MAINTAIN THE

02:53:55.992 --> 02:53:58.628
INTEGRITY IN ADDITION --

02:53:58.694 --> 02:54:00.496
TO THE ADMISSIONS OFFICERS OF

02:54:00.563 --> 02:54:02.598
EVERY SINGLE CAMPUS AND THOSE

02:54:02.665 --> 02:54:04.066
ARE OUR STUDENTS.

02:54:04.133 --> 02:54:07.570
I CAME FROM STUDENT IN THE

02:54:07.637 --> 02:54:09.405
THAT'S WHERE I GOT MY FEET WET

02:54:09.472 --> 02:54:10.940
WITH ORGANIZING.

02:54:11.007 --> 02:54:14.076
AND TO THINK OF EVERY PERSON OUT

02:54:14.143 --> 02:54:17.180
THERE THAT BENEFITTED FROM FREE

02:54:17.246 --> 02:54:20.249
VOLUNTEER SERVICES ON HOW TO

02:54:20.316 --> 02:54:21.250
BEAT THE BEEF UP.

02:54:21.317 --> 02:54:23.286
AN APPLICATION WHERE TO GET

02:54:23.352 --> 02:54:25.788
SCHOLARSHIPS FOR OR WAIVERS OF

02:54:25.855 --> 02:54:28.591
SORTS FOR THE SAT AND ACT EASE

02:54:28.658 --> 02:54:31.694
WHO VOLUNTEERED TO READ

02:54:31.761 --> 02:54:33.763
ADMISSIONS ESSAYS AND EDIT THEM

02:54:33.830 --> 02:54:35.364
TO PROVIDE FEEDBACK.

02:54:35.431 --> 02:54:36.732
I THINK IS ANOTHER EQUATION TO

02:54:36.799 --> 02:54:39.569
THE STORY AND IT'S BASED ON ONE

02:54:39.635 --> 02:54:40.903
OF I BELIEVE OUR STATE IN

02:54:40.970 --> 02:54:42.371
COUNTRIES FUNDAMENTAL VALUES

02:54:42.438 --> 02:54:45.041
THAT EVERYONE HAS AN EQUAL SHOT

02:54:45.107 --> 02:54:47.844
AND WILL HAVE EQUAL ACCESS TO IT.

02:54:47.910 --> 02:54:49.278
SO I HOPE THAT.

02:54:49.345 --> 02:54:50.947
WE WILL MAINTAIN THOSE IT SOUNDS

02:54:51.013 --> 02:54:52.381
FROM EVERYTHING THAT'S BEEN SAID

02:54:52.448 --> 02:54:54.183
THAT WE WILL I THINK YOU DO THE

02:54:54.250 --> 02:54:55.718
UC FOR NOT BEING SCARED TO

02:54:55.785 --> 02:54:57.253
ADDRESS IT FOR BEING THE FIRST

02:54:57.320 --> 02:54:58.654
TO BE UP FRONT --

02:54:58.721 --> 02:55:00.690
WE KNOW IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE

02:55:00.756 --> 02:55:01.824
THAT -- WHEN

02:55:01.891 --> 02:55:03.626
ONE PERSON VIOLATES A POLICY OR

02:55:03.693 --> 02:55:05.761
A LIGHT IS NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF

02:55:05.828 --> 02:55:08.664
THE ENTIRE LEGISLATURE --

02:55:08.731 --> 02:55:10.299
AND I THINK THAT THAT'S THE SAME --

02:55:10.366 --> 02:55:11.734
FOR THE UC --

02:55:11.801 --> 02:55:13.436
AND I LOOK FORWARD TO ANY

02:55:13.502 --> 02:55:14.804
OUTCOMES THAT.

02:55:14.871 --> 02:55:17.740

03:01:00.082 --> 03:01:01.517
ADMISSIONS FOR THE STUDENTS

03:01:01.584 --> 03:01:03.419

03:01:17.266 --> 03:01:18.500
GONNA ADD DOES ANYBODY CHECK TO

ACTUALLY SEE IF THAT PERSON'S

03:01:19.902 --> 03:01:21.470
ACTUALLY PLAYING THE SPORT AT

03:01:21.537 --> 03:01:23.572

03:01:26.675 --> 03:01:28.611
THE INVESTIGATION THAT ALEX WILL

03:01:28.677 --> 03:01:30.279

RIGHT OKAY WELL THAT'S A PROBLEM.

03:01:41.657 --> 03:01:44.893
THAT'S A PROBLEM IT MAY BE.

03:01:44.960 --> 03:01:45.928
WELL I MEAN THAT'S NOT I MEAN I

03:01:45.995 --> 03:01:46.428
KNOW YOU'RE GONNA DO AN

03:01:46.495 --> 03:01:47.863
INVESTIGATION WE ALL LOOK

03:01:47.930 --> 03:01:49.398
FORWARD TO THAT BUT AT THE SAME

03:01:49.465 --> 03:01:50.299
TOKEN.

03:01:50.366 --> 03:01:51.667
YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS

03:01:51.734 --> 03:01:54.236
STUFF RIGHT SO YOU SHOULD BE

ABLE TO TELL ME WHAT YOU DO DO.

03:01:55.971 --> 03:01:57.106
RIGHT NOW TODAY AND THAT'S WHAT

03:01:57.172 --> 03:02:01.076
I'M ASKING ABOUT IS IF WE JUST

03:02:01.143 --> 03:02:02.778
RELYING ON THE CODE SAYING YEAH

03:02:02.845 --> 03:02:04.246
THIS PERSON'S OKAY.

03:02:04.313 --> 03:02:06.382
THAT'S THAT'S A PROBLEM BECAUSE

03:02:06.448 --> 03:02:07.616
THEY COULD BE GETTING.

03:02:07.683 --> 03:02:09.051
POTENTIALLY THEY COULD BEGIN A

03:02:09.118 --> 03:02:10.452
BRIBE AND AND MAYBE THIS IS

03:02:10.519 --> 03:02:11.720
SOMEONE WHO'S NEVER EVEN PLAYED

03:02:11.787 --> 03:02:13.222
LACROSSE.

03:02:13.289 --> 03:02:15.257
OR WHATEVER IT IS IT'S IN SO HOW

03:02:15.324 --> 03:02:16.325

SAYS OKAY YOU'RE SAYING THIS

03:02:17.893 --> 03:02:19.395
PERSON.

03:02:19.461 --> 03:02:20.796
IS AN EXCEPTIONAL ATHLETE OR

03:02:20.863 --> 03:02:22.264
MAYBE THEY'RE AN EXCEPTIONAL

03:02:22.331 --> 03:02:23.666
VIOLINIST.

03:02:23.732 --> 03:02:24.266
WE HAVE ANYTHING THAT GOES

03:02:24.333 --> 03:02:26.935
ACROSS CHECKS THAT TO SAY OKAY

03:02:27.002 --> 03:02:27.703
THEY'RE ACTUALLY.

03:02:27.770 --> 03:02:29.772
DOING THIS AT THE SCHOOLS ARE

03:02:29.838 --> 03:02:30.372
COMING FROM --

03:02:30.439 --> 03:02:31.674
THERE IN ROLLED SOME IN SOME

03:02:31.740 --> 03:02:34.076
SORT OF YOUR VIOLINIST ACADEMY

03:02:34.143 --> 03:02:35.477
OR YOU HAVE BEEN A PART OF A

03:02:35.544 --> 03:02:36.745
LOCAL --

03:02:36.812 --> 03:02:38.781
SYMPHONY IS THERE ANY CROSS

03:02:38.847 --> 03:02:40.649
CHECKING THAT GOES ON THERE'S A

03:02:40.716 --> 03:02:42.151
COUPLE THINGS.

03:02:42.217 --> 03:02:42.918
EIGHT I THINK IT'S PROBABLY

03:02:42.985 --> 03:02:45.554
IMPORTANT TO NOTE HERE THAT SOME

03:02:45.621 --> 03:02:48.257
OF THOSE ITEMS AS THIS THIS

03:02:48.324 --> 03:02:50.059
PANEL WAS POINTED OUT.

03:02:50.125 --> 03:02:51.160
BECAUSE OF WELL HEELED

03:02:51.226 --> 03:02:52.227
INDIVIDUALS AND PEOPLE CRAFTING

03:02:52.294 --> 03:02:53.629
PROCESS YOU HAD THE FAKE

03:02:53.696 --> 03:02:55.230
DOCUMENTATION.

03:02:55.297 --> 03:02:56.899
YOU HAD THE FAKE.

03:02:56.965 --> 03:02:58.500
OR FRAUDULENT BOARD RESULTS YOU

03:02:58.567 --> 03:03:01.503
HAD THE MONEY GOING THROUGH

03:03:01.570 --> 03:03:02.705
CHARITABLE INSTITUTIONS.

03:03:02.771 --> 03:03:03.672
THOSE ARE THINGS THAT WE'RE NOT

03:03:03.739 --> 03:03:04.973
GOING TO BE ABLE TO CHECK

03:03:05.040 --> 03:03:06.975
BECAUSE UR OUTSIDE I DON'T HAVE

03:03:07.042 --> 03:03:08.043
SUBPOENA POWER.

03:03:08.110 --> 03:03:09.812
AND I'M NOT ABLE TO GO INTO A

03:03:09.878 --> 03:03:12.881
BANK ACCOUNT CATION IS PROVIDED

03:03:12.948 --> 03:03:14.717
BY A SCHOOL THAT'S FRAUDULENT ON

03:03:14.783 --> 03:03:17.586
THERE AND AND REYES BEYOND THAT

03:03:17.653 --> 03:03:19.088
TO LOOK AND SEE IF IT'S UNTRUE

03:03:19.154 --> 03:03:20.189
SO I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF

03:03:20.255 --> 03:03:21.123
LAYERS TO THIS.

03:03:21.190 --> 03:03:23.592
THE NEED TO BE EXAMINED I THINK

03:03:23.659 --> 03:03:24.760
ONE OF THE REASONS WHY BUT YOU

03:03:24.827 --> 03:03:26.328
CAN CHECK OF SOMEONE'S ACTUALLY

03:03:26.395 --> 03:03:27.963
A SOCCER PLAYER READ IT IS

03:03:28.030 --> 03:03:29.231
ABSOLUTELY TRUE I THINK WE

03:03:29.298 --> 03:03:30.799
SHOULD DO YOU DO THAT.

03:03:30.866 --> 03:03:34.269
WE DO HAVE. TO BE CLEAR PEOPLE

03:03:34.336 --> 03:03:36.038
CAN COME INTO A PROGRAM DECIDE

03:03:36.105 --> 03:03:37.973
NOT TO PLAY.

03:03:38.040 --> 03:03:40.409
AT ALL DAY ONE THERE'S NOTHING

03:03:40.476 --> 03:03:41.076
SURE WE CAN BUILD BUT WE KNOW IF

03:03:41.143 --> 03:03:42.544
THEY ACTUALLY DID PLAY BEFORE

03:03:42.611 --> 03:03:44.380
THEY GOT THERE RIGHT WE SHOULD

03:03:44.446 --> 03:03:48.117
BE ABLE TO HOLD THOSE WILL BE.

03:03:48.183 --> 03:03:49.418
LETTERS AND INFORMATION PROVIDED

03:03:49.485 --> 03:03:50.119
FROM THE SCHOOL.

03:03:50.185 --> 03:03:52.254
SO IF THE SCHOOL IS NOT ACCURATE

03:03:52.321 --> 03:03:53.822
OR IF THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE

03:03:53.889 --> 03:03:55.190
CRACKED IN THE PROCESS.

03:03:55.257 --> 03:03:57.626
AND YOU SEND FOR VERIFICATION

03:03:57.693 --> 03:03:59.027
VERIFICATION COMES BACK.

03:03:59.094 --> 03:04:00.596
THAT'S GOING TO BE VERY

03:04:00.662 --> 03:04:02.731
DIFFICULT FOR DO WE DO THAT. TO

03:04:02.798 --> 03:04:03.999
VERIFY WITH THE SCHOOL BUT WE

03:04:04.066 --> 03:04:06.135
RELY ON THE EXPERT BECAUSE

03:04:06.201 --> 03:04:07.369
THAT'S WHAT I HEARD FIRST

03:04:07.436 --> 03:04:08.771
THERE'S AN AUDIT PROCESS.

03:04:08.837 --> 03:04:10.806
THAT THE ADMISSIONS THEY WILL DO

03:04:10.873 --> 03:04:14.343
A A REVIEW AND SAMPLING OF THE

03:04:14.410 --> 03:04:16.345
PROCESSOR IDENTIFY IF THERE ARE

03:04:16.412 --> 03:04:17.546
ISSUES.

03:04:17.613 --> 03:04:19.748
RIGHT SO THEN YOU GET MY OFFICE

03:04:19.815 --> 03:04:21.150
WHICH IS ONE STEP REMOVED I'M

03:04:21.216 --> 03:04:23.018
THE INDEPENDENT AUTHORITY I WILL

03:04:23.085 --> 03:04:24.119
LOOK AT SOME OF THOSE.

03:04:24.186 --> 03:04:25.320
AND EXAMINE IF THOSE WERE

03:04:25.387 --> 03:04:26.588
ADEQUATE IF WE SHOULD BE

03:04:26.655 --> 03:04:27.856
TWEAKING THEM IF THERE'S OTHER

03:04:27.923 --> 03:04:29.057
THINGS.

03:04:29.124 --> 03:04:31.593
THAT WE NEED TO BE DOING BUT THE

03:04:31.660 --> 03:04:34.296
CRUX OF THIS CASE TO FIND

03:04:34.363 --> 03:04:35.964
INFORMATION AT THAT ADMISSIONS

03:04:36.031 --> 03:04:38.233
PROCESS SEES REALIZE SO A FAKE

03:04:38.300 --> 03:04:39.401
SAT.

03:04:39.468 --> 03:04:40.702
WE CAN DRILL ALL WE WANT THAT'S

03:04:40.769 --> 03:04:42.137
CONTRARY DIFFICULT I AGREE I'M

03:04:42.204 --> 03:04:43.639
I'M MORE TALKING ABOUT THINGS

03:04:43.705 --> 03:04:45.040
THAT YOU CAN.

03:04:45.107 --> 03:04:45.607
AND THAT'S WHAT INDEPENDENT

03:04:45.674 --> 03:04:47.676
ROBERT AND I THINK IT'S VERY

03:04:47.743 --> 03:04:49.178
FELL POINT THAT WE NEED TO

03:04:49.244 --> 03:04:50.712
CONTROL WHAT WE CAN'T CONTROL

03:04:50.779 --> 03:04:52.147
AND EXAMINE --

03:04:52.214 --> 03:04:54.082
THE THE INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE

03:04:54.149 --> 03:04:56.018
TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE SO THAT

03:04:56.084 --> 03:04:57.519
WE CAN FERRET OUT THESE ISSUES

03:04:57.586 --> 03:04:58.687
ONCE AND THEN IT JUST SO I

03:04:58.754 --> 03:04:59.321
UNDERSTAND YOUR ROLE A LITTLE

03:04:59.388 --> 03:05:00.255
BIT LIKE.

03:05:00.322 --> 03:05:01.590
WANT TO LOOK INTO THESE THINGS
