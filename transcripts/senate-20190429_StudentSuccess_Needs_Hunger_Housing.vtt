Adult program rating here for

00:00:12.712 --> 00:00:14.414
leadership from the campus and

00:00:14.481 --> 00:00:15.014
then we're gonna open up to

00:00:15.081 --> 00:00:16.549
student testimony or anyone

00:00:16.616 --> 00:00:18.651
who's here would like to share

00:00:18.718 --> 00:00:20.253
their thoughts can.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.589
Do that so all to visually take

00:00:22.655 --> 00:00:22.956
the gavel up.

00:00:23.022 --> 00:00:26.526
Signal to the audio video crew.

00:00:26.593 --> 00:00:28.661
Okay so we're gonna officially

00:00:28.728 --> 00:00:30.363
call the Senate.

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:30.930
Select committee on student

00:00:30.997 --> 00:00:32.332
success to order here in

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.401
Sacramento state. To be here

00:00:34.467 --> 00:00:36.369
this is a part of our a two year

00:00:36.436 --> 00:00:38.371
long tour of college campuses

00:00:38.438 --> 00:00:40.240
around California.

00:00:40.306 --> 00:00:42.275
That focuses on the issues of

00:00:42.342 --> 00:00:44.344
student needs -- As it relates

00:00:44.411 --> 00:00:46.446
to food as it relates to housing.

00:00:46.513 --> 00:00:48.381
As it relates to mental health.

00:00:48.448 --> 00:00:50.316
And also importantly as it

00:00:50.383 --> 00:00:50.884
relates to the ability of

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:52.485
students to get through and get

00:00:52.552 --> 00:00:54.387
their degree -- And for years

00:00:54.454 --> 00:00:56.589
I'm joined on this panel by many

00:00:56.656 --> 00:00:58.558
distinguished leaders here from

00:00:58.625 --> 00:01:00.260
this area from the state.

00:01:00.326 --> 00:01:02.362
On my right senator pan on my

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:02.896
left senator McCarty both

00:01:02.962 --> 00:01:04.564
representing Sacramento state in

00:01:04.631 --> 00:01:06.232
the legislature.

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.568
And on my far left center Allen --

00:01:08.635 --> 00:01:10.203
A member of the Senate from

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.305
southern California former chair

00:01:12.372 --> 00:01:12.806
of the Senate Education

00:01:12.872 --> 00:01:13.106
Committee.

00:01:13.173 --> 00:01:16.209
So prior to this hearing we all

00:01:16.276 --> 00:01:16.843
of us participated in tours of

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:18.678
the campus in different select

00:01:18.745 --> 00:01:19.078
areas we heard.

00:01:19.145 --> 00:01:20.713
A few minutes ago from center

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.682
pan on the four year graduation.

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:24.517
Rate issue and we're gonna hear

00:01:24.584 --> 00:01:26.453
a lot more from the testimony in

00:01:26.519 --> 00:01:26.953
just a couple minutes.

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.655
We are from Senate assembly

00:01:28.721 --> 00:01:30.323
member McCarty about basic needs

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.358
in the new food pantry here at

00:01:32.425 --> 00:01:34.594
Sacramento state certainly a

00:01:34.661 --> 00:01:36.362
point of pride to have it.

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:36.796
That it comes in an

00:01:36.863 --> 00:01:38.598
uncomfortable moment because so

00:01:38.665 --> 00:01:40.767
many students are -- Not not

00:01:40.834 --> 00:01:42.602
able to get some basic food

00:01:42.669 --> 00:01:44.571
needs met and that's the the

00:01:44.637 --> 00:01:45.171
advantage of having that the

00:01:45.238 --> 00:01:46.806
pantry here -- And then of

00:01:46.873 --> 00:01:48.641
course the area of mental health

00:01:48.708 --> 00:01:50.443
and senator Allen and I I got a

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.612
chance to tour -- The the well

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:54.714
the student health and

00:01:54.781 --> 00:01:56.416
counseling service center it's

00:01:56.483 --> 00:01:58.351
very impressive by you know bill.

00:01:58.418 --> 00:02:00.587
From student fees -- Trying to

00:02:00.653 --> 00:02:02.422
treat the whole student and it's

00:02:02.489 --> 00:02:04.557
a it's a very impressive.

00:02:04.624 --> 00:02:06.526
Solidity no one of the fax --

00:02:06.593 --> 00:02:08.461
Unfortunate facts about student

00:02:08.528 --> 00:02:10.363
life and our colleges today.

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:12.699
Is that 16% of the students at

00:02:12.765 --> 00:02:14.400
the state university system all

00:02:14.467 --> 00:02:16.469
twenty three campuses 16% --

00:02:16.536 --> 00:02:18.471
Receive some sort of

00:02:18.538 --> 00:02:20.340
psychological counseling or

00:02:20.406 --> 00:02:28.348
treatment on campuses last year.

00:02:28.414 --> 00:02:28.748
Extinguish sent.

00:02:28.815 --> 00:02:29.415
And when we went through the the

00:02:29.482 --> 00:02:30.783
well here this morning and we

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.485
got the facts about how many

00:02:32.552 --> 00:02:33.152
students are treated it's a it's

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:34.654
a large number that's great over

00:02:34.721 --> 00:02:35.255
thirty thousand students have

00:02:35.321 --> 00:02:36.623
visited the what the well

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:36.890
Saturday.

00:02:36.956 --> 00:02:38.858
At to deal with that urgent care

00:02:38.925 --> 00:02:42.328
needs -- Medical needs medicines

00:02:42.395 --> 00:02:42.896
and certainly counseling.

00:02:42.962 --> 00:02:44.764
And and when the survey to

00:02:44.831 --> 00:02:46.466
understand what was the number

00:02:46.533 --> 00:02:48.368
one reason for visiting.

00:02:48.434 --> 00:02:48.768
At the top issue.

00:02:48.835 --> 00:02:52.372
Was depression and anxiety.

00:02:52.438 --> 00:02:54.374
Depression and anxiety.

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:55.008
And I and I have learned Jeff

00:02:55.074 --> 00:02:56.809
both in my previous services a

00:02:56.876 --> 00:02:58.344
trustee of the state

00:02:58.411 --> 00:03:00.413
universities and as a parent --

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.549
Date if you have a student that

00:03:02.615 --> 00:03:04.484
is a struggling -- And stressed

00:03:04.551 --> 00:03:06.352
out for whatever reason.

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:08.555
That it could it could really

00:03:08.621 --> 00:03:10.356
stop complete stop.

00:03:10.423 --> 00:03:12.358
There at their education.

00:03:12.425 --> 00:03:14.327
Is that things aren't together

00:03:14.394 --> 00:03:16.629
whatever it is -- Sometimes you

00:03:16.696 --> 00:03:18.498
just can't go to that class and

00:03:18.565 --> 00:03:20.366
you can't take that test.

00:03:20.433 --> 00:03:24.437
And unfortunately statewide the

00:03:24.504 --> 00:03:25.104
ability of a student to be seen

00:03:25.171 --> 00:03:28.474
quickly -- Is very very poor.

00:03:28.541 --> 00:03:30.843
In some cases up to three weeks

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:32.645
think about that you're in a

00:03:32.712 --> 00:03:34.547
state of crisis.

00:03:34.614 --> 00:03:35.181
And it takes you three weeks to

00:03:35.248 --> 00:03:36.382
get a point.

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:37.016
But one of the purposes of our

00:03:37.083 --> 00:03:38.818
college tour is is to learn.

00:03:38.885 --> 00:03:40.753
At where things are going right.

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:42.855
And we want to celebrate that

00:03:42.922 --> 00:03:44.824
and with things aren't doing so

00:03:44.891 --> 00:03:46.859
well I mean one apartment trying

00:03:46.926 --> 00:03:47.293
to make it better.

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:48.828
But I'm really pleased to hear

00:03:48.895 --> 00:03:50.730
in my my visits with the

00:03:50.797 --> 00:03:52.432
leadership of the counseling

00:03:52.498 --> 00:03:53.066
center that if you're a student

00:03:53.132 --> 00:03:54.567
here at Sacramento state.

00:03:54.634 --> 00:03:56.536
And you're in crisis that

00:03:56.603 --> 00:03:57.170
someone is going to be able to

00:03:57.236 --> 00:04:00.473
see you that day.

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:01.074
That's the model that they've

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.444
created -- They called it the

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.479
the urgent care.

00:04:06.546 --> 00:04:06.746
A model.

00:04:06.813 --> 00:04:08.815
That I it's not just about

00:04:08.881 --> 00:04:10.617
getting an appointment where you

00:04:10.683 --> 00:04:11.150
can sit down for an hour.

00:04:11.217 --> 00:04:12.952
If it's someone struggling that

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:14.821
day whether it's balancing your

00:04:14.887 --> 00:04:16.489
bank account.

00:04:16.556 --> 00:04:17.090
Or being stressed out about a

00:04:17.156 --> 00:04:18.691
class that here at Sacramento

00:04:18.758 --> 00:04:20.893
state you can see you can meet

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:22.829
with somebody and talk that

00:04:22.895 --> 00:04:23.196
issue through.

00:04:23.262 --> 00:04:24.464
Immediately.

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.532
And it's very impressive and I

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:28.434
hope the tape take the model

00:04:28.501 --> 00:04:29.002
that you've used to do that

00:04:29.068 --> 00:04:30.536
because it hasn't come

00:04:30.603 --> 00:04:32.472
necessarily with more money.

00:04:32.538 --> 00:04:34.440
But with their adjustment of how

00:04:34.507 --> 00:04:34.807
you deal with.

00:04:34.874 --> 00:04:36.476
These types of mental health.

00:04:36.542 --> 00:04:38.444
And counseling challenges I know

00:04:38.511 --> 00:04:39.045
we're gonna hear from some of

00:04:39.112 --> 00:04:40.480
your leadership about that.

00:04:40.546 --> 00:04:41.114
But there were seven thousand

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:42.815
visits here at Saks State.

00:04:42.882 --> 00:04:44.684
Opera counseling.

00:04:44.751 --> 00:04:46.686
And while it seems like a lot.

00:04:46.753 --> 00:04:48.588
You know that they're getting

00:04:48.655 --> 00:04:49.155
taken care of means that.

00:04:49.222 --> 00:04:50.556
It's going to affect so many

00:04:50.623 --> 00:04:51.157
other things to talk about the

00:04:51.224 --> 00:04:52.592
whole person.

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:54.594
And the ability to stay in

00:04:54.661 --> 00:04:54.827
school.

00:04:54.894 --> 00:04:56.663
And that's gonna be reflected a

00:04:56.729 --> 00:04:58.765
graduation rates -- And low debt

00:04:58.831 --> 00:05:00.600
and all kinds of other things

00:05:00.667 --> 00:05:00.933
that relate.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.535
To that help with that that was

00:05:02.602 --> 00:05:04.437
very impressive to me I know

00:05:04.504 --> 00:05:05.104
there's other things to say in a

00:05:05.171 --> 00:05:05.371
debrief.

00:05:05.438 --> 00:05:06.739
About trying to tap into the

00:05:06.806 --> 00:05:08.708
resources center Allen anything

00:05:08.775 --> 00:05:10.710
you wanted to add to that before

00:05:10.777 --> 00:05:12.578
we begin how.

00:05:12.645 --> 00:05:14.947
Well I you know wanted to

00:05:15.014 --> 00:05:16.616
obviously thank everyone for

00:05:16.683 --> 00:05:18.751
helping to put all this together

00:05:18.818 --> 00:05:20.453
at yeah I don't know if anyone

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:21.087
saw but the lead story in the

00:05:21.154 --> 00:05:22.488
Sacramento bee.

00:05:22.555 --> 00:05:24.557
Is office basically the findings

00:05:24.624 --> 00:05:26.459
of a of a very -- Contemporary

00:05:26.526 --> 00:05:27.060
recent you see Berkeley study

00:05:27.126 --> 00:05:28.594
that shows that anxiety

00:05:28.661 --> 00:05:30.563
depression and stress among

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:31.230
college students are at epidemic.

00:05:31.297 --> 00:05:32.598
Levels.

00:05:32.665 --> 00:05:34.701
And the two major issues at the

00:05:34.767 --> 00:05:38.671
the article the report cites is.

00:05:38.738 --> 00:05:39.405
The extraordinary amount of data.

00:05:39.472 --> 00:05:40.840
And financial security that

00:05:40.907 --> 00:05:42.942
students are currently dealing

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:44.744
with you have a lot of folks

00:05:44.811 --> 00:05:46.846
coming in from -- Already

00:05:46.913 --> 00:05:48.581
financially precarious positions

00:05:48.648 --> 00:05:58.658
and then we make their position

00:05:58.725 --> 00:06:00.593
even more precarious by just.

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:02.695
You know how asking them to

00:06:02.762 --> 00:06:03.362
finance a a public education or

00:06:03.429 --> 00:06:04.597
education.

00:06:04.664 --> 00:06:05.131
That's the first thing the

00:06:05.198 --> 00:06:06.599
second thing interestingly.

00:06:06.666 --> 00:06:06.766
Is.

00:06:06.833 --> 00:06:08.768
Social media -- Phones.

00:06:08.835 --> 00:06:10.803
Computers the extent to which we

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:11.471
are isolating ourselves in ways

00:06:11.537 --> 00:06:12.872
that previous generations have

00:06:12.939 --> 00:06:13.072
not.

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:14.841
It's interesting this generation

00:06:14.907 --> 00:06:16.609
is physically safer.

00:06:16.676 --> 00:06:18.945
Because bye bye bye mentally --

00:06:19.011 --> 00:06:20.880
More insecure because folks are

00:06:20.947 --> 00:06:22.615
so.

00:06:22.682 --> 00:06:24.717
Delved in to the world -- The

00:06:24.784 --> 00:06:25.084
virtual world.

00:06:25.151 --> 00:06:27.019
And and it leads to a whole

00:06:27.086 --> 00:06:28.888
series of of psychological

00:06:28.955 --> 00:06:30.590
challenges mental challenges.

00:06:30.656 --> 00:06:32.959
That were all scrambling to try

00:06:33.025 --> 00:06:36.596
to help address.

00:06:36.662 --> 00:06:37.263
On the financial side of course.

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:38.631
You know we're all working on

00:06:38.698 --> 00:06:40.566
trying to improve the situation

00:06:40.633 --> 00:06:41.134
I you know some of the bill

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:42.769
ideas were brought up -- You

00:06:42.835 --> 00:06:44.704
know one of these I'd love to

00:06:44.771 --> 00:06:45.071
work on is it.

00:06:45.138 --> 00:06:46.973
Yeah tax write off for since our

00:06:47.039 --> 00:06:48.941
tax credit for de. For student

00:06:49.008 --> 00:06:49.142
debt.

00:06:49.208 --> 00:06:50.910
I love to work with these

00:06:50.977 --> 00:06:54.580
numbers on on that -- Wiener

00:06:54.647 --> 00:06:55.181
it's integration I working on

00:06:55.248 --> 00:06:56.616
better coordination.

00:06:56.682 --> 00:06:57.250
And data collection associated

00:06:57.316 --> 00:06:58.785
with our higher educational

00:06:58.851 --> 00:06:59.452
systems that we can do a better

00:06:59.519 --> 00:07:00.620
job.

00:07:00.686 --> 00:07:02.655
Of understanding the needs of

00:07:02.722 --> 00:07:04.690
students today and and having

00:07:04.757 --> 00:07:05.324
better articulation through the

00:07:05.391 --> 00:07:07.026
K. to twelve system the cal

00:07:07.093 --> 00:07:08.795
state and when.

00:07:08.861 --> 00:07:09.395
Houses do twenty going to grad

00:07:09.462 --> 00:07:14.834
school elsewhere how do we help

00:07:14.901 --> 00:07:18.604
make that system work better.

00:07:18.671 --> 00:07:19.205
Then of course -- You try to

00:07:19.272 --> 00:07:20.940
reduce costs in general -- And

00:07:21.007 --> 00:07:22.809
have really strong health

00:07:22.875 --> 00:07:23.409
infrastructure in place and I

00:07:23.476 --> 00:07:24.744
was I was impressed to see --

00:07:24.811 --> 00:07:25.411
The the extent to which the well

00:07:25.478 --> 00:07:27.213
is is really stepped up I love

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:28.948
the fact that even grades with

00:07:29.015 --> 00:07:30.750
physical health and on the other

00:07:30.817 --> 00:07:32.685
wall and all that the cold --

00:07:32.752 --> 00:07:33.052
I've you know.

00:07:33.119 --> 00:07:33.686
Worked out facilities that are

00:07:33.753 --> 00:07:35.188
there also the fact that mental

00:07:35.254 --> 00:07:36.856
health counseling and and some

00:07:36.923 --> 00:07:38.758
of the other more traditional

00:07:38.825 --> 00:07:39.358
medical care is in the same

00:07:39.425 --> 00:07:40.726
place.

00:07:40.793 --> 00:07:41.360
As one of things we talk about

00:07:41.427 --> 00:07:43.029
the tour is that there's a quite

00:07:43.095 --> 00:07:44.730
a stigma associated with.

00:07:44.797 --> 00:07:46.966
Getting counseling -- But if you

00:07:47.033 --> 00:07:48.701
go to the ER nobody you know

00:07:48.768 --> 00:07:52.872
there's no stigma associated

00:07:52.939 --> 00:07:54.740
with I don't know if you got a

00:07:54.807 --> 00:07:55.441
hi you have some sort of minor --

00:07:55.508 --> 00:07:57.009
Physical ailment that needs

00:07:57.076 --> 00:08:00.746
addressing -- It's it's nice not

00:08:00.813 --> 00:08:02.682
to have to say -- Counseling

00:08:02.748 --> 00:08:02.982
over there.

00:08:03.049 --> 00:08:03.249
You know.

00:08:03.316 --> 00:08:04.984
Other types of care over here

00:08:05.051 --> 00:08:06.786
that that's something that

00:08:06.853 --> 00:08:07.420
sometimes lead students did not

00:08:07.486 --> 00:08:08.955
want to go into the counseling

00:08:09.021 --> 00:08:09.589
room because they're a little.

00:08:09.655 --> 00:08:11.090
Yeah they're they're worried

00:08:11.157 --> 00:08:12.825
about the stigma their little

00:08:12.892 --> 00:08:13.426
bit Joel sheepish about it so

00:08:13.492 --> 00:08:14.927
integrating man understanding

00:08:14.994 --> 00:08:15.494
that there is a health and

00:08:15.561 --> 00:08:16.929
wellness nexus that is so strong

00:08:16.996 --> 00:08:17.463
and so important for us to

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:18.731
understand.

00:08:18.798 --> 00:08:21.033
Was great now it really is a

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:24.704
reflection of kind of best

00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:26.739
practices in the field so.

00:08:26.806 --> 00:08:27.206
You know I'm we're all

00:08:27.273 --> 00:08:28.841
struggling to help make the

00:08:28.908 --> 00:08:29.408
system work better for young

00:08:29.475 --> 00:08:30.676
people we have not made it easy

00:08:30.743 --> 00:08:31.310
I mean it is just extraordinary

00:08:31.377 --> 00:08:32.812
to me how much.

00:08:32.879 --> 00:08:33.346
I think about my parents'

00:08:33.412 --> 00:08:35.014
generation and the extent to

00:08:35.081 --> 00:08:35.581
which society stepped up to

00:08:35.648 --> 00:08:36.816
provide.

00:08:36.883 --> 00:08:37.450
Low cost high quality public

00:08:37.516 --> 00:08:40.853
education for them and how we

00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:41.487
have just eaten away at that

00:08:41.554 --> 00:08:43.289
promise that is inherent master

00:08:43.356 --> 00:08:46.826
plan over the decades.

00:08:46.893 --> 00:08:47.493
It is such a shame is such a it

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:48.928
does such an injustice to the

00:08:48.995 --> 00:08:51.097
next generation and also doesn't

00:08:51.163 --> 00:08:52.999
it just as to what to us as a

00:08:53.065 --> 00:08:55.067
society because a really does

00:08:55.134 --> 00:08:56.836
the track from.

00:08:56.903 --> 00:08:57.403
Students ability to grow and

00:08:57.470 --> 00:08:58.971
thrive once they get out of

00:08:59.038 --> 00:09:00.873
school and start a business and

00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:02.808
buy a house and build a family

00:09:02.875 --> 00:09:03.476
and all the kinds of things that

00:09:03.542 --> 00:09:05.278
we associate with the American

00:09:05.344 --> 00:09:07.246
dream self -- That's part of why

00:09:07.313 --> 00:09:08.881
we're here tomorrow I was part

00:09:08.948 --> 00:09:09.482
of this committee and and and

00:09:09.548 --> 00:09:10.082
and just try to learn in fact

00:09:10.149 --> 00:09:11.250

00:09:11.317 --> 00:09:12.818
from you.

00:09:12.885 --> 00:09:14.787
So that we can help to promote

00:09:14.854 --> 00:09:17.023
better policies that will --

00:09:17.089 --> 00:09:24.797

We're gonna start with that with

00:09:57.563 --> 00:10:06.839
the president Nelson -- Hi.

00:10:06.906 --> 00:10:07.406
It's it's somewhat argue you

00:10:07.473 --> 00:10:09.208
know we finish a legislative

00:10:09.275 --> 00:10:10.810
career what did you do that

00:10:10.876 --> 00:10:11.477
really mattered or not mattered

00:10:11.544 --> 00:10:12.979
but it's arguable that maybe the

00:10:13.045 --> 00:10:15.014
most important thing I ever did.

00:10:15.081 --> 00:10:15.614
Was service the chair of the

00:10:15.681 --> 00:10:17.249
presidential selection committee

00:10:17.316 --> 00:10:19.185
here in Sacramento state -- And

00:10:19.251 --> 00:10:21.220
would together with my

00:10:21.287 --> 00:10:22.989
colleagues on the board of

00:10:23.055 --> 00:10:23.689
trustees -- Selected that Robert

00:10:23.756 --> 00:10:25.358
Nelson to be your president here

00:10:25.424 --> 00:10:25.725
in Sacramento.

00:10:25.791 --> 00:10:26.392
And it may be the most important

00:10:26.459 --> 00:10:27.393
decision I've ever made because

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:29.195
of the great job that you are

00:10:29.261 --> 00:10:29.495

00:10:31.063 --> 00:10:31.564

Over the last two years and and

00:10:33.366 --> 00:10:33.933
making a big difference I know

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:34.533
there's a lot of things you're

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:35.167
very excited about that are

00:10:35.234 --> 00:10:35.801
happening here we're gonna hear

00:10:35.868 --> 00:10:36.002

to hearing your thoughts about

00:10:41.607 --> 00:10:43.242
these important issues of basic

00:10:43.309 --> 00:10:43.909
needs and and that'll help them.

00:10:43.976 --> 00:10:49.248

00:10:49.315 --> 00:10:50.950

00:10:55.121 --> 00:10:55.521
assemblyman carting.

We are honored to have you here

00:10:57.423 --> 00:10:57.990
and we're honored to be able to

00:10:58.057 --> 00:11:00.926
show you a little bit about our

00:11:00.993 --> 00:11:01.560
campus and what we're trying to

00:11:01.627 --> 00:11:04.964
do -- When you did hire me?

00:11:05.031 --> 00:11:07.099
I open up the hood of the car

00:11:07.166 --> 00:11:09.068
and we showed everybody what was

00:11:09.135 --> 00:11:11.003
inside and that was an 8%

00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:12.938
graduation rate.

00:11:13.005 --> 00:11:13.539
I'm very proud to say that we

00:11:13.606 --> 00:11:17.076
are currently at a fourteen

00:11:17.143 --> 00:11:17.376
point 7%.

00:11:17.443 --> 00:11:20.913
And just making that small

00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:21.514
change if you do back of the

00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:22.948
envelope.

00:11:23.015 --> 00:11:24.917
Numbers it's saved our students

00:11:24.984 --> 00:11:26.919
ninety three million dollars

00:11:26.986 --> 00:11:28.921
they would have to pay intuition

00:11:28.988 --> 00:11:30.923
just making that little change

00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:33.059
we are now predicting that we

00:11:33.125 --> 00:11:34.960
will be at 21%.

00:11:35.027 --> 00:11:37.263
In the September of this year

00:11:37.329 --> 00:11:39.031
that's a four year graduate as a

00:11:39.098 --> 00:11:40.966
four year graduation rate.

00:11:41.033 --> 00:11:43.069
We've already broken all of the

00:11:43.135 --> 00:11:44.937
other moves as far as it goes

00:11:45.004 --> 00:11:47.139
were 10% higher than the system

00:11:47.206 --> 00:11:49.175
thought we were going to be in

00:11:49.241 --> 00:11:51.177
twenty twenty five four or four

00:11:51.243 --> 00:11:53.012
years -- For six year graduation

00:11:53.079 --> 00:11:55.081
rates and we're just moving

00:11:55.147 --> 00:11:57.016
forward how did we do it we

00:11:57.083 --> 00:11:59.151
added a thousand new classes we

00:11:59.218 --> 00:12:01.187
could never added those thousand

00:12:01.253 --> 00:12:03.022
new classes without the help of

00:12:03.089 --> 00:12:03.422
the legislature.

00:12:03.489 --> 00:12:05.324
The graduation initiative gave

00:12:05.391 --> 00:12:09.228
us the money to be able to add

00:12:09.295 --> 00:12:11.130
those classes.

00:12:11.197 --> 00:12:13.199
That thousand classes cost six

00:12:13.265 --> 00:12:15.067
point two million dollars.

00:12:15.134 --> 00:12:15.568
With out the graduation

00:12:15.634 --> 00:12:17.369
initiative we would not have

00:12:17.436 --> 00:12:19.071
been there.

00:12:19.138 --> 00:12:21.040
We then added a hundred and

00:12:21.107 --> 00:12:21.640
seventy seven new faculty we

00:12:21.707 --> 00:12:25.277
added advisors and we are moving

00:12:25.344 --> 00:12:27.079
the needle.

00:12:27.146 --> 00:12:27.580
For but it's not about

00:12:27.646 --> 00:12:29.415
graduating in four years as you

00:12:29.482 --> 00:12:31.550
said it's about having the

00:12:31.617 --> 00:12:33.385
opportunity to graduate in four

00:12:33.452 --> 00:12:35.187
years.

00:12:35.254 --> 00:12:37.056
Many students will not.

00:12:37.123 --> 00:12:39.158
Will never be a 100% graduation

00:12:39.225 --> 00:12:41.193
for years will never be 70%

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.496
graduation M. for years we care

00:12:43.562 --> 00:12:45.164
about all of our students.

00:12:45.231 --> 00:12:45.831
And that means we have to care

00:12:45.898 --> 00:12:47.766
about their mental health and we

00:12:47.833 --> 00:12:49.502
have to care about what they are

00:12:49.568 --> 00:12:51.270
doing and how they're moving

00:12:51.337 --> 00:12:53.172
forward.

00:12:53.239 --> 00:12:55.207
We care about the students who

00:12:55.274 --> 00:12:57.176
are homeless the ramp.

00:12:57.243 --> 00:12:57.543
In Sacramento.

00:12:57.610 --> 00:12:59.678
Keeps going up we know that.

00:12:59.745 --> 00:13:03.716
So even with the cal grants

00:13:03.782 --> 00:13:04.383
we're never going to be able to

00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:07.586
help on all those ways there.

00:13:07.653 --> 00:13:08.154
Are maybe Jean C. housing

00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:10.156
program has six beds in it

00:13:10.222 --> 00:13:13.225
students can come and stay there

00:13:13.292 --> 00:13:15.394
for up to thirty days that's not

00:13:15.461 --> 00:13:15.995
a lot of beds but it makes a

00:13:16.061 --> 00:13:17.363
difference and we're working

00:13:17.429 --> 00:13:19.265
with everybody around here.

00:13:19.331 --> 00:13:21.233
In the area to help the students

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:23.369
the student emergency grant.

00:13:23.435 --> 00:13:25.604
Which often prevents

00:13:25.671 --> 00:13:28.240
homelessness a student can go in

00:13:28.307 --> 00:13:31.210
and get something maybe it's for

00:13:31.277 --> 00:13:34.246
a higher that's out maybe it's

00:13:34.313 --> 00:13:36.215
for medicines that they can't

00:13:36.282 --> 00:13:36.448
afford.

00:13:36.515 --> 00:13:39.351
Maybe it's for rent that there

00:13:39.418 --> 00:13:41.253
maybe it's that book that they

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:42.688
just couldn't get.

00:13:42.755 --> 00:13:43.289
We've got Ted grant and their

00:13:43.355 --> 00:13:46.258
their over a hundred students

00:13:46.325 --> 00:13:49.328
signed up for cal grant.

00:13:49.395 --> 00:13:51.030
How fresh this year already so

00:13:51.096 --> 00:13:52.498
we're trying to provide as many

00:13:52.565 --> 00:13:53.432
services we can?

00:13:53.499 --> 00:13:57.136
We have our counselors not only

00:13:57.203 --> 00:13:57.770
in the well that you saw today.

00:13:57.836 --> 00:13:59.505
But also in engineering also in

00:13:59.572 --> 00:14:01.440
the dreamers resource center

00:14:01.507 --> 00:14:03.542
also it in athletics so that

00:14:03.609 --> 00:14:07.279
they can be out there and help

00:14:07.346 --> 00:14:07.880
in every place that we can.

00:14:07.947 --> 00:14:09.615
This next year we're going to

00:14:09.682 --> 00:14:11.450
add one in Lassen hall which is

00:14:11.517 --> 00:14:13.519
this one stop center for our

00:14:13.586 --> 00:14:15.521
students so we care about the

00:14:15.588 --> 00:14:17.456
students we care about them

00:14:17.523 --> 00:14:19.291
being successful.

00:14:19.358 --> 00:14:21.293
I have a great.

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:23.529
Group of in people of panel it's

00:14:23.596 --> 00:14:23.963
going to come up.

00:14:24.029 --> 00:14:25.264
You'll see how honest are.

00:14:25.331 --> 00:14:27.433
And how much they really do care

00:14:27.499 --> 00:14:29.268
because we are a Hornet family

00:14:29.335 --> 00:14:31.337
so thank you for having us here

00:14:31.403 --> 00:14:31.570
today.

00:14:31.637 --> 00:14:39.411
And I'm sorry but I better do

00:14:39.478 --> 00:14:43.182
stingers up.

00:14:43.249 --> 00:14:45.384
At present Nelson thank you for

00:14:45.451 --> 00:14:47.253
that sharing at the that great

00:14:47.319 --> 00:14:47.920
progress eight from 8% four year

00:14:47.987 --> 00:14:49.188
graduation rate 214%.

00:14:49.255 --> 00:14:51.390
Last year with the with the hope

00:14:51.457 --> 00:14:53.259
and belief it's going. To go up

00:14:53.325 --> 00:14:55.327
220% so that's that's fantastic

00:14:55.394 --> 00:14:55.995
assembly member ID I do have a

00:14:56.061 --> 00:14:57.563
question need in this year's C.

00:14:57.630 --> 00:14:59.431
S. U. budget.

00:14:59.498 --> 00:15:00.032
They there is -- Scott fifteen

00:15:00.099 --> 00:15:01.433
million dollars for some these

00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:01.967
basic needs initiatives.

00:15:02.034 --> 00:15:07.406
And it's it's one time

00:15:07.473 --> 00:15:09.275
unfortunately.

00:15:09.341 --> 00:15:11.477
Ironically the C. S. you see --

00:15:11.543 --> 00:15:12.111
Budget item is the same fifteen

00:15:12.177 --> 00:15:13.512
but on going so.

00:15:13.579 --> 00:15:15.547
We were trying to make that I'm

00:15:15.614 --> 00:15:17.516
going which would be of course

00:15:17.583 --> 00:15:19.918
nice for the C. C. system twenty

00:15:19.985 --> 00:15:20.286
three campuses.

00:15:20.352 --> 00:15:20.886
If the what's the difference

00:15:20.953 --> 00:15:22.921
what you can do one time verses

00:15:22.988 --> 00:15:24.623
on going in other words are

00:15:24.690 --> 00:15:24.857
there.

00:15:24.923 --> 00:15:25.491
You can get I'm I'm sure the I

00:15:25.557 --> 00:15:26.725
know the answer but you know

00:15:26.792 --> 00:15:31.463
ongoing initiatives and you can --

00:15:31.530 --> 00:15:31.664
Have.

00:15:31.730 --> 00:15:33.599
Some -- Consistency and in

00:15:33.666 --> 00:15:37.903
finding knowing that that can be

00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:38.404
viable year after year.

00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:39.638
I'm going money means that we

00:15:39.705 --> 00:15:40.239
can hire people that will be

00:15:40.306 --> 00:15:41.774
here to provide services on

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:43.542
going okay you can't hire people

00:15:43.609 --> 00:15:45.311
on one time money.

00:15:45.377 --> 00:15:45.844
You can hire him for a few

00:15:45.911 --> 00:15:46.078
months.

00:15:46.145 --> 00:15:47.646
But then you just hiring

00:15:47.713 --> 00:15:49.448
adjuncts or something like that

00:15:49.515 --> 00:15:51.483
and that is what we want to do

00:15:51.550 --> 00:15:53.419
we will we will put the money

00:15:53.485 --> 00:15:55.421
that if it is one time into

00:15:55.487 --> 00:15:55.954
programs we'll put it into

00:15:56.021 --> 00:15:57.656
counseling sessions we'll put it

00:15:57.723 --> 00:15:59.825
into improving the pantry even.

00:15:59.892 --> 00:16:03.329
More than what we're doing well

00:16:03.395 --> 00:16:05.331
add some beds but it will be

00:16:05.397 --> 00:16:05.664
short term.

00:16:05.731 --> 00:16:09.234
So we very much want to have on

00:16:09.301 --> 00:16:09.601
going sounds.

00:16:09.668 --> 00:16:11.737
Great trying to make that happen

00:16:11.804 --> 00:16:13.405
thank you.

00:16:13.472 --> 00:16:15.474
He's the guy I know that in the

00:16:15.541 --> 00:16:15.741
assembly.

00:16:15.808 --> 00:16:17.543
All right -- Let you hang tight

00:16:17.609 --> 00:16:18.177
we're gonna hear from a couple

00:16:18.243 --> 00:16:19.745
other folks -- Joys Stewart

00:16:19.812 --> 00:16:21.580
James -- Exact it is the

00:16:21.647 --> 00:16:22.147
executive director of the

00:16:22.214 --> 00:16:23.782
student health and counselling

00:16:23.849 --> 00:16:25.517
services joy.

00:16:25.584 --> 00:16:27.453
Thank you for your leadership --

00:16:27.519 --> 00:16:31.457
And such an important area with

00:16:31.523 --> 00:16:35.527
forty hearing your remarks.

00:16:35.594 --> 00:16:37.563
Good morning thank you so much

00:16:37.629 --> 00:16:38.230
for taking the time -- To see a

00:16:38.297 --> 00:16:39.898
facilities and what what what

00:16:39.965 --> 00:16:41.900
we're trying to work on towards

00:16:41.967 --> 00:16:45.671
our students -- One of the

00:16:45.738 --> 00:16:47.740
things that -- We try to do

00:16:47.806 --> 00:16:49.842
about eight years ago we tried

00:16:49.908 --> 00:16:51.677
to shift our focus from being

00:16:51.744 --> 00:16:53.746
what we would consider a illness

00:16:53.812 --> 00:16:57.783
driven or response kind of model

00:16:57.850 --> 00:16:58.317
to a much more proactive

00:16:58.384 --> 00:16:59.852
holistic -- Approach to

00:16:59.918 --> 00:17:01.787
providing services and over the

00:17:01.854 --> 00:17:05.391
last -- Really eight years we

00:17:05.457 --> 00:17:07.493
look for ways to integrate -- To

00:17:07.559 --> 00:17:09.528
give you some numbers -- Eight

00:17:09.595 --> 00:17:11.597
years ago roughly 2222% of our

00:17:11.663 --> 00:17:13.799
student population was accessing

00:17:13.866 --> 00:17:15.634
the health center and less than

00:17:15.701 --> 00:17:17.903
223% was using the counseling

00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:21.673
center -- We've grown 55258% of

00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:25.677
our student population routinely

00:17:25.744 --> 00:17:26.211
accesses our health center

00:17:26.278 --> 00:17:28.013
services.

00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:32.985
And 7210% access our counseling

00:17:33.051 --> 00:17:33.252
services.

00:17:33.318 --> 00:17:35.254
And through that approach we've

00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:38.991
had to really -- Broaden our

00:17:39.057 --> 00:17:41.193
efforts on prevention screening

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:42.694
prevention and early

00:17:42.761 --> 00:17:44.596
intervention and five years ago

00:17:44.663 --> 00:17:45.898
we began we decided that the top

00:17:45.964 --> 00:17:48.000
presenting problems when we

00:17:48.066 --> 00:17:49.835
looked at the medical side and

00:17:49.902 --> 00:17:52.004
we looked at the counseling side.

00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:54.139
To anxiety and depression were

00:17:54.206 --> 00:17:56.241
in the top five for both and it

00:17:56.308 --> 00:17:58.110
was at that point that we said

00:17:58.177 --> 00:18:00.112
you know we're treating the same

00:18:00.179 --> 00:18:00.779
patients we need to have a much

00:18:00.846 --> 00:18:02.080
more coordinated approach on how

00:18:02.147 --> 00:18:03.816
we do this.

00:18:03.882 --> 00:18:05.951
So we began screening and we

00:18:06.018 --> 00:18:07.953
screen our students for

00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:10.222
depression on the medical side.

00:18:10.289 --> 00:18:13.792
And really through a grant --

00:18:13.859 --> 00:18:15.694
The cal mesa grand we establish

00:18:15.761 --> 00:18:17.696
the urgent care model which was

00:18:17.763 --> 00:18:19.998
one where students either

00:18:20.065 --> 00:18:21.967
presenting -- For distress or

00:18:22.034 --> 00:18:24.036
those that scored high on the

00:18:24.102 --> 00:18:25.971
depression screening are in fact

00:18:26.038 --> 00:18:29.908
seen -- That day that.

00:18:29.975 --> 00:18:31.910
Immediately -- From that we

00:18:31.977 --> 00:18:32.544
began looking at other data and

00:18:32.611 --> 00:18:35.781
found that 30% of our student

00:18:35.848 --> 00:18:37.749
population only really needs one

00:18:37.816 --> 00:18:38.383
counseling appointment so just

00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:40.185
this fall we implemented single

00:18:40.252 --> 00:18:45.991
session visits which will allow

00:18:46.058 --> 00:18:47.993
some students. To come in for

00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:49.761
more problem solving kinds of

00:18:49.828 --> 00:18:53.799
things so -- It's as as she

00:18:53.866 --> 00:18:54.399
center Allen mention those of

00:18:54.466 --> 00:18:55.834
the issues the demand --

00:18:55.901 --> 00:18:58.070
Continues we have to continue to

00:18:58.136 --> 00:19:02.040
look -- For ways to change our

00:19:02.107 --> 00:19:04.042
service delivery on how we

00:19:04.109 --> 00:19:05.978
provide services to students --

00:19:06.044 --> 00:19:08.247
And expand -- You know the

00:19:08.313 --> 00:19:10.282
number of programs -- That we

00:19:10.349 --> 00:19:11.950
have.

00:19:12.017 --> 00:19:13.886
The the more recent thing we did

00:19:13.952 --> 00:19:15.954
this fall that I think -- Is is

00:19:16.021 --> 00:19:18.156
interesting it is we adopted the

00:19:18.223 --> 00:19:20.292
screening program that many --

00:19:20.359 --> 00:19:22.261
Healthcare facilities are using

00:19:22.327 --> 00:19:24.363
which is identifying food and

00:19:24.429 --> 00:19:26.031
security.

00:19:26.098 --> 00:19:27.900
So all of our students that come

00:19:27.966 --> 00:19:28.467
into the health center our

00:19:28.534 --> 00:19:30.302
screen for food and security

00:19:30.369 --> 00:19:31.970
this fall.

00:19:32.037 --> 00:19:34.206
We I just have the phone numbers

00:19:34.273 --> 00:19:37.809
and we screen -- To over roughly

00:19:37.876 --> 00:19:38.443
shy of four thousand students

00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:41.980
and 31% of those students --

00:19:42.047 --> 00:19:42.581
Were screened as possible for

00:19:42.648 --> 00:19:44.383
food and security and so we were

00:19:44.449 --> 00:19:46.418
able to do an immediate referral

00:19:46.485 --> 00:19:48.554
over to the cares office and get

00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:50.055
the students connected -- With

00:19:50.122 --> 00:19:52.257
cow freshen the food pantry and

00:19:52.324 --> 00:19:54.092
so I think that's a great way

00:19:54.159 --> 00:19:56.028
for us all to be working

00:19:56.094 --> 00:19:57.796
together to early identify

00:19:57.863 --> 00:19:58.430
students that might not go to

00:19:58.497 --> 00:20:00.198
the pantry initially but come to

00:20:00.265 --> 00:20:03.802
the health center -- So we're

00:20:03.869 --> 00:20:05.871
continually looking for ways for

00:20:05.938 --> 00:20:08.006
us to cross can -- Collaborate

00:20:08.073 --> 00:20:08.407
on those things.

00:20:08.473 --> 00:20:11.910
That thank you joy joy and thank

00:20:11.977 --> 00:20:13.912
you could.

00:20:13.979 --> 00:20:14.580
C. L. what a beautiful facility

00:20:14.646 --> 00:20:16.248
you have to work with their so I

00:20:16.315 --> 00:20:17.950
know that's just part of the

00:20:18.016 --> 00:20:20.018
issue -- In terms a terrified

00:20:20.085 --> 00:20:22.321
and they care that **** that we

00:20:22.387 --> 00:20:23.855
all want to provide.

00:20:23.922 --> 00:20:26.091
I I I noted that the lesson is

00:20:26.158 --> 00:20:28.093
here the dean of students.

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:28.694
And you have a big portfolio

00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:30.228
here on campus and go way beyond

00:20:30.295 --> 00:20:38.036
just -- Mental health and and

00:20:38.103 --> 00:20:41.907
healthcare services but at

00:20:41.974 --> 00:20:42.507
what's going well what's not

00:20:42.574 --> 00:20:43.175
going so well what can you share

00:20:43.241 --> 00:20:43.442
with us.

00:20:43.508 --> 00:20:43.909
Thank you good morning

00:20:43.976 --> 00:20:44.209
[inaudible]

00:20:44.276 --> 00:20:46.044
I'm.

00:20:46.111 --> 00:20:48.046
I I. frequently side of I'm very

00:20:48.113 --> 00:20:50.082
commonly discussed C. S. T. wide --

00:20:50.148 --> 00:20:50.682
Study that was done I'm sure

00:20:50.749 --> 00:20:52.017
you're all familiar with it --

00:20:52.084 --> 00:20:52.618
It's projected that C. S. U.

00:20:52.684 --> 00:20:54.086
wide approximately forty one

00:20:54.152 --> 00:20:54.686
point 6% of students reported

00:20:54.753 --> 00:20:56.321
experiencing food and security

00:20:56.388 --> 00:20:59.958
in the past twelve months --

00:21:00.025 --> 00:21:02.060
Over twenty one point six of

00:21:02.127 --> 00:21:03.962
those students reported very low

00:21:04.029 --> 00:21:05.964
access to food.

00:21:06.031 --> 00:21:08.066
Additionally ten point 9% of

00:21:08.133 --> 00:21:09.901
students reported experiencing

00:21:09.968 --> 00:21:12.104
homelessness in the past twelve

00:21:12.170 --> 00:21:12.671
months those are staggering

00:21:12.738 --> 00:21:14.272
numbers when we think about.

00:21:14.339 --> 00:21:16.241
The the enormity of our system

00:21:16.308 --> 00:21:18.143
and we're certainly seeing those

00:21:18.210 --> 00:21:20.178
those numbers bear out here at

00:21:20.245 --> 00:21:21.947
Sacramento state.

00:21:22.014 --> 00:21:24.049
Some of the things that we do to

00:21:24.116 --> 00:21:24.750
address this crisis and a number

00:21:24.816 --> 00:21:26.284
of years ago I'd say probably

00:21:26.351 --> 00:21:29.988
five or six years ago we we

00:21:30.055 --> 00:21:31.990
surveyed and students who left

00:21:32.057 --> 00:21:32.224
school.

00:21:32.290 --> 00:21:34.393
After the first year -- Stopped

00:21:34.459 --> 00:21:36.261
out we noticed that the vast

00:21:36.328 --> 00:21:38.030
majority of them were in good

00:21:38.096 --> 00:21:38.664
academic standing most people

00:21:38.730 --> 00:21:40.399
assume that if students left

00:21:40.465 --> 00:21:42.134
school it was because they found

00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:42.334
out.

00:21:42.401 --> 00:21:44.136
That wasn't the case so we we

00:21:44.202 --> 00:21:46.405
sent out an exit survey of all

00:21:46.471 --> 00:21:48.373
this to all the students who'd

00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:50.108
left to ask why did they leave

00:21:50.175 --> 00:21:52.044
what what went wrong if their

00:21:52.110 --> 00:21:52.577
grades were were okay.

00:21:52.644 --> 00:21:55.914
And what they overwhelmingly

00:21:55.981 --> 00:21:56.381
said the top number.

00:21:56.448 --> 00:21:57.916
On the top reason that students

00:21:57.983 --> 00:22:00.185
left school after their first

00:22:00.252 --> 00:22:02.187
year work was physical hardship

00:22:02.254 --> 00:22:04.122
financial hardship.

00:22:04.189 --> 00:22:06.491
So we wrap our heads around that

00:22:06.558 --> 00:22:07.159
problem a little bit and and we

00:22:07.225 --> 00:22:08.193
ask more questions in the

00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:08.860
financial hardships weren't that

00:22:08.927 --> 00:22:10.328
large we're not talking about

00:22:10.395 --> 00:22:12.297
thousands of dollars that the

00:22:12.364 --> 00:22:12.864
students were missing we're

00:22:12.931 --> 00:22:14.332
talking about sometimes just a

00:22:14.399 --> 00:22:15.967
few.

00:22:16.034 --> 00:22:16.635
Hundred so that so a couple of

00:22:16.702 --> 00:22:18.270
years and into my time here we

00:22:18.336 --> 00:22:20.439
instituted something called in

00:22:20.505 --> 00:22:22.040
at the student emergency grant

00:22:22.107 --> 00:22:22.641
it's now called the Robert us

00:22:22.708 --> 00:22:24.276
next Nelson.

00:22:24.342 --> 00:22:26.078
Student emergency grant.

00:22:26.144 --> 00:22:28.113
I'm not grant was established to

00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:28.780
help students when when they've

00:22:28.847 --> 00:22:30.415
experienced some kind of crisis

00:22:30.482 --> 00:22:32.484
that forced them to make a

00:22:32.551 --> 00:22:34.519
choice between continuing in

00:22:34.586 --> 00:22:34.753
school.

00:22:34.820 --> 00:22:38.290
Or or addressing the problem --

00:22:38.356 --> 00:22:40.358
Or paying their rent or eating

00:22:40.425 --> 00:22:41.026
that month no one should have to

00:22:41.093 --> 00:22:42.594
make that choice.

00:22:42.661 --> 00:22:45.063
So.

00:22:45.130 --> 00:22:45.630
Not for five years ago we

00:22:45.697 --> 00:22:48.300
instituted the emergencies grant

00:22:48.366 --> 00:22:50.135
is really our first step in a

00:22:50.202 --> 00:22:51.737
long line of services that we've

00:22:51.803 --> 00:22:52.738
since created. To address these

00:22:52.804 --> 00:22:54.706
kinds of issues for our students

00:22:54.773 --> 00:22:56.575
and keep them in school and keep

00:22:56.641 --> 00:23:00.512
them I'm working toward their

00:23:00.579 --> 00:23:00.746
goals.

00:23:00.812 --> 00:23:02.314
Shortly after the emergency

00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:02.981
grant was instituted we created

00:23:03.048 --> 00:23:04.349
our emergency housing program.

00:23:04.416 --> 00:23:06.485
Doctor Nelson pointed out that

00:23:06.551 --> 00:23:08.053
we have six spends on campus

00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:10.322
they're always full so we've

00:23:10.388 --> 00:23:12.057
seen so every year we see

00:23:12.124 --> 00:23:14.126
approximately fifty students who

00:23:14.192 --> 00:23:16.328
stay on campus for approximately

00:23:16.394 --> 00:23:18.330
thirty days as emergency stopgap

00:23:18.396 --> 00:23:20.198
housing while they C. case

00:23:20.265 --> 00:23:22.167
manager to secure a longer term.

00:23:22.234 --> 00:23:24.503
Resources in addition there are

00:23:24.569 --> 00:23:26.404
some students who aren't able to

00:23:26.471 --> 00:23:28.340
stay on campus maybe they have a

00:23:28.406 --> 00:23:30.075
dependent -- Maybe they have a

00:23:30.142 --> 00:23:30.742
small child in a residence hall

00:23:30.809 --> 00:23:32.544
is inappropriate for them so we

00:23:32.611 --> 00:23:34.412
instituted an agreement with a

00:23:34.479 --> 00:23:36.381
local motel for for housing

00:23:36.448 --> 00:23:38.083
vouchers to supplement.

00:23:38.150 --> 00:23:42.120
So that all of our students can

00:23:42.187 --> 00:23:44.089
be equally served.

00:23:44.156 --> 00:23:44.723
Joy mentioned the the wonderful

00:23:44.790 --> 00:23:46.525
partnership we have with student

00:23:46.591 --> 00:23:47.058
health and counselling the

00:23:47.125 --> 00:23:50.095
screening her her screening.

00:23:50.162 --> 00:23:52.063
Program has referred to a great

00:23:52.130 --> 00:23:52.664
number of students we project

00:23:52.731 --> 00:23:54.533
that over two hundred and fifty

00:23:54.599 --> 00:23:56.301
of those students will have been

00:23:56.368 --> 00:23:58.136
registered for cal French fresh

00:23:58.203 --> 00:24:00.539
services this year. To your

00:24:00.605 --> 00:24:00.772
point.

00:24:00.839 --> 00:24:02.541
Assembly member McCarty that's

00:24:02.607 --> 00:24:04.476
that's teaching to fish instead

00:24:04.543 --> 00:24:08.079
of giving the fish for the day.

00:24:08.146 --> 00:24:10.081
We also provide.

00:24:10.148 --> 00:24:12.050
Have an annual clothing drive

00:24:12.117 --> 00:24:12.617
for students and we provide

00:24:12.684 --> 00:24:14.252
financial coaching.

00:24:14.319 --> 00:24:16.521
So it's very difficult to make a

00:24:16.588 --> 00:24:18.490
small number of dollars stretch

00:24:18.557 --> 00:24:20.759
but we work with our students to

00:24:20.826 --> 00:24:22.527
teach them all sorts of ways. To

00:24:22.594 --> 00:24:24.563
make the most of the resources

00:24:24.629 --> 00:24:26.198
that they have access.

00:24:26.264 --> 00:24:28.266
To I think the thing that that.

00:24:28.333 --> 00:24:30.735
I'm most excited about is our

00:24:30.802 --> 00:24:32.504
comprehensive case management

00:24:32.571 --> 00:24:34.206
services.

00:24:34.272 --> 00:24:36.441
So a little over three years ago

00:24:36.508 --> 00:24:38.543
we had the the ability to bring

00:24:38.610 --> 00:24:40.545
on a very talented case manager

00:24:40.612 --> 00:24:42.180
from from our community.

00:24:42.247 --> 00:24:44.549
And the reason this became a

00:24:44.616 --> 00:24:46.318
game changer is because the

00:24:46.384 --> 00:24:46.985
office the cares office that you

00:24:47.052 --> 00:24:48.753
toward this morning became a

00:24:48.820 --> 00:24:50.322
single point of contact for

00:24:50.388 --> 00:24:50.589
students.

00:24:50.655 --> 00:24:52.624
Many of whom are are suffering

00:24:52.691 --> 00:24:54.492
from multiple challenges at once

00:24:54.559 --> 00:24:56.595
not just one they don't fit

00:24:56.661 --> 00:24:58.496
neatly into one of these

00:24:58.563 --> 00:24:58.997
services when when you

00:24:59.064 --> 00:25:00.565
experience one challenge I'm

00:25:00.632 --> 00:25:02.534
sure you know he experienced

00:25:02.601 --> 00:25:04.202
several.

00:25:04.269 --> 00:25:04.870
And so the the students for the

00:25:04.936 --> 00:25:06.238
who are the most impacted the

00:25:06.304 --> 00:25:08.206
students who have.

00:25:08.273 --> 00:25:10.375
The most complex issues are able

00:25:10.442 --> 00:25:12.544
to see one person who can unpack

00:25:12.611 --> 00:25:14.479
all of the different issues an

00:25:14.546 --> 00:25:16.648
axe to help them to access the

00:25:16.715 --> 00:25:18.350
many different resources that

00:25:18.416 --> 00:25:20.285
they may sometimes need.

00:25:20.352 --> 00:25:20.919
In order to get things put in

00:25:20.986 --> 00:25:22.587
place in order for them to

00:25:22.654 --> 00:25:24.322
continue to be successful and

00:25:24.389 --> 00:25:26.491
fed and housed.

00:25:26.558 --> 00:25:28.493
In that office -- If you have an

00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:30.595
opportunity to see it we have

00:25:30.662 --> 00:25:32.597
lockers because sometimes

00:25:32.664 --> 00:25:34.666
homeless students need to make

00:25:34.733 --> 00:25:36.368
use of our of our local shelters.

00:25:36.434 --> 00:25:38.503
And sometimes they're free to do

00:25:38.570 --> 00:25:40.505
that because they they may worry

00:25:40.572 --> 00:25:42.274
about theft of a laptop or if

00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:42.908
they're expensive textbooks so

00:25:42.974 --> 00:25:44.609
we have lockers for students to

00:25:44.676 --> 00:25:46.444
be able to lock their valuables

00:25:46.511 --> 00:25:48.680
and in order. To to be as

00:25:48.747 --> 00:25:50.548
resourceful as they can to meet

00:25:50.615 --> 00:25:52.484
their housing needs we have

00:25:52.550 --> 00:25:54.653
mailboxes so that if your if

00:25:54.719 --> 00:25:56.655
your housing is in securing you

00:25:56.721 --> 00:25:57.289
don't have a permanent mailing

00:25:57.355 --> 00:25:58.290
address.

00:25:58.356 --> 00:26:00.425
You have the opportunity to get

00:26:00.492 --> 00:26:02.394
your mail so that some of the

00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:04.296
services that have been put in

00:26:04.362 --> 00:26:08.300
place don't get cut off because

00:26:08.366 --> 00:26:10.302
you missed an important notice.

00:26:10.368 --> 00:26:10.869
These students are followed

00:26:10.936 --> 00:26:11.336
throughout the year.

00:26:11.403 --> 00:26:12.570
They're given every resource

00:26:12.637 --> 00:26:14.639
available and I'm happy to say

00:26:14.706 --> 00:26:16.308
that even though they're some of

00:26:16.374 --> 00:26:18.276
the most complicated situations

00:26:18.343 --> 00:26:18.910
that we encounter on campus.

00:26:18.977 --> 00:26:22.414
They haven't over over 87% of

00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:24.649
them continue to stay in school

00:26:24.716 --> 00:26:26.618
or graduate at the end of each

00:26:26.685 --> 00:26:28.353
semester.

00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:28.853
And those are the most

00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:30.588
complicated cases that we see so

00:26:30.655 --> 00:26:32.590
we know this model works we know

00:26:32.657 --> 00:26:34.426
that it's helping people to stay

00:26:34.492 --> 00:26:35.093
in school and we know that it's

00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:36.695
helping people. To achieve a

00:26:36.761 --> 00:26:38.496
brighter future thank you for

00:26:38.563 --> 00:26:40.532
all of your support because the

00:26:40.598 --> 00:26:41.132
S. B. eighty five funds were

00:26:41.199 --> 00:26:44.336
funds that were used. To create

00:26:44.402 --> 00:26:44.970
the cares space and everything

00:26:45.036 --> 00:26:46.471
that Senate today so we thank

00:26:46.538 --> 00:26:48.373
you for your support.

00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:48.907
And the evidence of your

00:26:48.974 --> 00:26:50.642
investment in our students by

00:26:50.709 --> 00:26:52.477
being here in engaging with us

00:26:52.544 --> 00:26:56.381
in this conversation.

00:26:56.448 --> 00:26:57.048
Thank you I. D. lease and that.

00:26:57.115 --> 00:26:58.383
It's great to hear about your

00:26:58.450 --> 00:26:58.984
case management work and the

00:26:59.050 --> 00:27:00.618
impact that can have on on the

00:27:00.685 --> 00:27:02.520
whole student and and certainly

00:27:02.587 --> 00:27:04.489
the emergency grants in the

00:27:04.556 --> 00:27:05.123
housing vouchers and clothing

00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:06.691
drive in the financial literacy

00:27:06.758 --> 00:27:08.460
all those things are.

00:27:08.526 --> 00:27:10.328
Really add up to a big number.

00:27:10.395 --> 00:27:12.497
In keeping kids in school and

00:27:12.564 --> 00:27:14.332
keeping them focused.

00:27:14.399 --> 00:27:16.434
On their degree attainments and

00:27:16.501 --> 00:27:16.634
then.

00:27:16.701 --> 00:27:18.336
All that that leads to so --

00:27:18.403 --> 00:27:18.903
Great leadership we really

00:27:18.970 --> 00:27:20.472
appreciate it.

00:27:20.538 --> 00:27:22.440
And we appreciate all your

00:27:22.507 --> 00:27:24.442
insight any questions before we

00:27:24.509 --> 00:27:26.378
continue with our okay.

00:27:26.444 --> 00:27:28.313
Let.

00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:30.548
Me invite that -- No well mora

00:27:30.615 --> 00:27:32.584
the president of the Sacramento

00:27:32.650 --> 00:27:34.419
state associate students -- You

00:27:34.486 --> 00:27:36.321
have a a challenging job.

00:27:36.388 --> 00:27:38.456
I know because I used to be in

00:27:38.523 --> 00:27:40.425
that job forty years ago --

00:27:40.492 --> 00:27:42.527
State university but hopefully

00:27:42.594 --> 00:27:44.462
you're having fun to but we

00:27:44.529 --> 00:27:46.331
appreciate your insight.

00:27:46.398 --> 00:27:47.032
And your commitment to your your

00:27:47.098 --> 00:27:48.533
fellow students and look for

00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:54.539
here testing like this morning.

00:27:54.606 --> 00:27:54.973
Thank you welcome.

00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:56.775
Well thank you and good morning

00:27:56.841 --> 00:27:58.343
to all of you senators and

00:27:58.410 --> 00:28:00.311
assembly members that are here.

00:28:00.378 --> 00:28:06.384
Actually gonna take the Mike --

00:28:06.451 --> 00:28:07.018
And I want to thank my fellow

00:28:07.085 --> 00:28:08.653
panelists and really all of the

00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:09.287
students that are -- Here today

00:28:09.354 --> 00:28:10.388
too because it is an

00:28:10.455 --> 00:28:10.989
overwhelming timing for that

00:28:11.056 --> 00:28:12.624
same reason I think you -- For

00:28:12.690 --> 00:28:13.124
visiting and and really

00:28:13.191 --> 00:28:14.559
listening to our student

00:28:14.626 --> 00:28:16.494
concerns as they relate to

00:28:16.561 --> 00:28:18.463
student basic needs it shows

00:28:18.530 --> 00:28:20.498
your leadership and for that I

00:28:20.565 --> 00:28:22.434
think you.

00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:23.134
I think it's important really to

00:28:23.201 --> 00:28:24.903
begin by setting an overview of

00:28:24.969 --> 00:28:26.671
our student needs.

00:28:26.738 --> 00:28:28.740
And as Beth mentioned we know

00:28:28.807 --> 00:28:32.477
that about 10% of our students

00:28:32.544 --> 00:28:32.811
system wide.

00:28:32.877 --> 00:28:34.646
Were -- Don't know where they're

00:28:34.712 --> 00:28:35.246
going to sleep in any given

00:28:35.313 --> 00:28:38.583
night -- Whether that means that

00:28:38.650 --> 00:28:40.318
their couch surfing.

00:28:40.385 --> 00:28:41.019
Where they're out right homeless?

00:28:41.086 --> 00:28:44.589
We know that about 47% of our

00:28:44.656 --> 00:28:46.291
students here at sac state which

00:28:46.357 --> 00:28:46.958
is higher than the system wide

00:28:47.025 --> 00:28:48.593
average experience exile

00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:50.428
eighteen over where they're

00:28:50.495 --> 00:28:51.062
going to whether they're going

00:28:51.129 --> 00:28:54.299
to have a full meal or any meal

00:28:54.365 --> 00:28:54.532
at all.

00:28:54.599 --> 00:28:56.334
At the end of that day.

00:28:56.401 --> 00:28:58.303
That's not conducive to sitting

00:28:58.369 --> 00:29:00.305
in a classroom and going through

00:29:00.371 --> 00:29:02.440
an academic experience.

00:29:02.507 --> 00:29:04.542
We know that our students are

00:29:04.609 --> 00:29:05.176
visiting the counselors at our

00:29:05.243 --> 00:29:06.678
help center for mental wellness

00:29:06.744 --> 00:29:08.847
at high rates during high stress

00:29:08.913 --> 00:29:10.748
periods like exam weeks and at

00:29:10.815 --> 00:29:12.851
various points throughout the

00:29:12.917 --> 00:29:13.218
year of course.

00:29:13.284 --> 00:29:14.853
The fact that most of our

00:29:14.919 --> 00:29:16.721
students are working students is

00:29:16.788 --> 00:29:18.523
really no coincidence when

00:29:18.590 --> 00:29:20.525
looking at these statistics.

00:29:20.592 --> 00:29:22.694
It's true that life can get to

00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:24.496
be especially hectic for our

00:29:24.562 --> 00:29:24.996
students with competing

00:29:25.063 --> 00:29:26.698
responsibilities that include --

00:29:26.764 --> 00:29:28.666
Working those multiple jobs

00:29:28.733 --> 00:29:30.602
maintaining academic achievement

00:29:30.668 --> 00:29:32.403
and engaging in professional

00:29:32.470 --> 00:29:34.472
activities that are needed to

00:29:34.539 --> 00:29:35.106
meet the demands of the present

00:29:35.173 --> 00:29:36.441
day work force.

00:29:36.508 --> 00:29:38.443
Times have changed.

00:29:38.510 --> 00:29:38.977
Not to mention that most

00:29:39.043 --> 00:29:40.645
students are local and

00:29:40.712 --> 00:29:42.514
contribute to helping their

00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:44.449
families and communities as well.

00:29:44.516 --> 00:29:44.949
So this makes accessing

00:29:45.016 --> 00:29:46.784
resources like the S. I. food

00:29:46.851 --> 00:29:48.853
pantry -- Not only helpful but

00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:50.755
critical to student success

00:29:50.822 --> 00:29:52.457
retention and graduation.

00:29:52.524 --> 00:29:54.592
We know that students utilizing

00:29:54.659 --> 00:29:56.661
our pantry are often feeding

00:29:56.728 --> 00:29:58.429
multiple people.

00:29:58.496 --> 00:29:59.063
And we're appreciative of the

00:29:59.130 --> 00:30:02.400
money set aside for basic needs

00:30:02.467 --> 00:30:03.168
in the governor's budget

00:30:03.234 --> 00:30:04.736
Because we really need it.

00:30:04.802 --> 00:30:08.640
The pantry saw six thousand

00:30:08.706 --> 00:30:10.475
visits so far this year. Ten

00:30:10.542 --> 00:30:11.142
thousand people have been fed by

00:30:11.209 --> 00:30:12.443
those visits.

00:30:12.510 --> 00:30:14.779
In this week alone since we

00:30:14.846 --> 00:30:16.648
opened re opened our food pantry

00:30:16.714 --> 00:30:18.449
here in our university union.

00:30:18.516 --> 00:30:20.418
We have seen three hundred and

00:30:20.485 --> 00:30:21.052
forty student visits just this

00:30:21.119 --> 00:30:22.453
week alone.

00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:26.491
Our highest months all 110030% --

00:30:26.558 --> 00:30:28.593
Increase from the previous year.

00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:32.430
And if Dodd doesn't demonstrate

00:30:32.497 --> 00:30:34.699
the need and the impact of these

00:30:34.766 --> 00:30:36.467
resources.

00:30:36.534 --> 00:30:37.068
I really don't know what else

00:30:37.135 --> 00:30:38.469
does.

00:30:38.536 --> 00:30:40.505
As our campus First Lady Jody

00:30:40.572 --> 00:30:42.507
Nielsen set herself this

00:30:42.574 --> 00:30:44.442
situation is bittersweet.

00:30:44.509 --> 00:30:45.009
Because it's good to see

00:30:45.076 --> 00:30:46.444
students are being supported.

00:30:46.511 --> 00:30:48.413
But it should also not mean that

00:30:48.479 --> 00:30:49.047
the scenario is one that we're

00:30:49.113 --> 00:30:52.450
stuck with in perpetuity.

00:30:52.517 --> 00:30:54.586
I have said this for a while but

00:30:54.652 --> 00:30:55.253
these are basic needs after all.

00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:56.955
There should be a point where we

00:30:57.021 --> 00:30:58.523
start focusing on more than the

00:30:58.590 --> 00:30:59.157
base minimum and start to allow

00:30:59.224 --> 00:31:00.892
for resources from the campus

00:31:00.959 --> 00:31:02.894
community whether it's from a

00:31:02.961 --> 00:31:04.762
desire from another local entity.

00:31:04.829 --> 00:31:06.531
To go towards high impact

00:31:06.598 --> 00:31:08.666
practices like study abroad --

00:31:08.733 --> 00:31:12.570
Aid and summered for state.

00:31:12.637 --> 00:31:13.204
We know that this is going to

00:31:13.271 --> 00:31:14.739
put our students on an equal

00:31:14.806 --> 00:31:16.574
playing field.

00:31:16.641 --> 00:31:18.543
And we have to start thinking

00:31:18.610 --> 00:31:20.545
ahead towards again those things

00:31:20.612 --> 00:31:20.979
that come beyond.

00:31:21.045 --> 00:31:22.780
I recognize that there's a

00:31:22.847 --> 00:31:23.414
hierarchy of needs but public

00:31:23.481 --> 00:31:24.549
higher education.

00:31:24.616 --> 00:31:27.018
After all be publicly funded and

00:31:27.085 --> 00:31:28.686
through a holistic approach

00:31:28.753 --> 00:31:30.755
which is why work.

00:31:30.822 --> 00:31:30.989
Again.

00:31:31.055 --> 00:31:32.991
Very very thankful and honored

00:31:33.057 --> 00:31:34.892
that this conversation is

00:31:34.959 --> 00:31:35.193
happening.

00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:36.861
Now I don't mean to sound like

00:31:36.928 --> 00:31:38.796
I'm running for an officer

00:31:38.863 --> 00:31:40.598
giving some generic speech but

00:31:40.665 --> 00:31:41.232
this is what I really believe

00:31:41.299 --> 00:31:43.001
after representing our students

00:31:43.067 --> 00:31:44.569
for the past two years.

00:31:44.636 --> 00:31:46.704
Is that a significant number of

00:31:46.771 --> 00:31:49.040
our students -- For pop you are

00:31:49.107 --> 00:31:50.942
vulnerable population within our

00:31:51.009 --> 00:31:52.677
state.

00:31:52.744 --> 00:31:53.311
I really do think that students

00:31:53.378 --> 00:31:54.746
are Holyoke vulnerable

00:31:54.812 --> 00:31:56.614
population we're a microcosm of

00:31:56.681 --> 00:31:58.883
our state this is largely due to

00:31:58.950 --> 00:32:00.585
the rising cost of living and

00:32:00.652 --> 00:32:02.520
the rising cost of a public

00:32:02.587 --> 00:32:02.920
higher education.

00:32:02.987 --> 00:32:04.856
And it goes to the fact that we

00:32:04.922 --> 00:32:06.591
know that state investment in

00:32:06.658 --> 00:32:08.626
the CSU is comparatively lower

00:32:08.693 --> 00:32:10.561
than a couple of decades ago.

00:32:10.628 --> 00:32:11.162
And amidst competing funding

00:32:11.229 --> 00:32:14.799
priorities we're now in a

00:32:14.866 --> 00:32:16.868
situation. For student basic

00:32:16.934 --> 00:32:17.535
needs have become a crisis point

00:32:17.602 --> 00:32:18.569
in our society.

00:32:18.636 --> 00:32:20.872
The thing is you did basic needs

00:32:20.938 --> 00:32:22.540
are California's basically it's

00:32:22.607 --> 00:32:24.609
just magnified due to

00:32:24.676 --> 00:32:25.109
circumstance which I've

00:32:25.176 --> 00:32:26.577
mentioned.

00:32:26.644 --> 00:32:28.546
This is an intersecting issue

00:32:28.613 --> 00:32:29.147
and I hope that we can all see

00:32:29.213 --> 00:32:30.581
that.

00:32:30.648 --> 00:32:32.550
And as we sit here I'm thinking

00:32:32.617 --> 00:32:33.151
of the student parent that's

00:32:33.217 --> 00:32:34.786
looking for emergency housing

00:32:34.852 --> 00:32:35.420
and can't be placed in a shared

00:32:35.486 --> 00:32:36.587
room.

00:32:36.654 --> 00:32:38.923
I'm thinking of the undocumented

00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:40.625
students who is too afraid to

00:32:40.692 --> 00:32:42.760
ask for support and file forms

00:32:42.827 --> 00:32:44.729
with their information on it.

00:32:44.796 --> 00:32:45.396
I'm thinking of so many students

00:32:45.463 --> 00:32:46.931
who feel the sense of urgency

00:32:46.998 --> 00:32:48.700
after sleeping in their cars or

00:32:48.766 --> 00:32:50.668
showering out origin.

00:32:50.735 --> 00:32:52.904
California's university must

00:32:52.970 --> 00:32:54.839
serve California and that's why

00:32:54.906 --> 00:32:55.540
I'm hopeful that sharing some of

00:32:55.606 --> 00:32:57.108
the students stories with you

00:32:57.175 --> 00:32:58.776
today here at sac state.

00:32:58.843 --> 00:33:01.045
Will help engaging the magnitude

00:33:01.112 --> 00:33:02.780
of this problem.

00:33:02.847 --> 00:33:03.381
I look forward to hearing more

00:33:03.448 --> 00:33:04.982
student voices.

00:33:05.049 --> 00:33:07.085
And again I thank you for your

00:33:07.151 --> 00:33:08.986
willingness to listen even if

00:33:09.053 --> 00:33:10.755
this conversation may sometimes

00:33:10.822 --> 00:33:12.957
seem predictable repetitive I

00:33:13.024 --> 00:33:15.193
promise you it is neither.

00:33:15.259 --> 00:33:17.061
Thank you.

00:33:17.128 --> 00:33:17.362
Thank you.

00:33:17.428 --> 00:33:19.197
Thank you Mister Moore a great

visits to the food pantry this

00:33:30.408 --> 00:33:30.541
year.

00:33:30.608 --> 00:33:33.211
And certainly -- Your bill your

00:33:33.277 --> 00:33:35.613
belief that student basic needs

00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:36.147
are in a crisis point is

00:33:36.214 --> 00:33:39.150
something that I think all of us

00:33:39.217 --> 00:33:39.751
share I think that's why we're

00:33:39.817 --> 00:33:39.951
here.

00:33:40.017 --> 00:33:41.219

dean's honors list I came into

00:34:04.842 --> 00:34:05.376
my college career with twelve

00:34:05.443 --> 00:34:08.913
units on my transcript for my

00:34:08.980 --> 00:34:12.850
college units -- But then all

00:34:12.917 --> 00:34:14.786
change in my junior year -- I

come from a lot of financial

00:34:15.453 --> 00:34:17.121
privilege but also a lot of

00:34:17.188 --> 00:34:18.790
abuse.

00:34:18.856 --> 00:34:20.792
So when I decided to stand up

00:34:20.858 --> 00:34:22.960
against my abuser and leave I

00:34:23.027 --> 00:34:23.461
was left with nothing.

00:34:23.528 --> 00:34:25.163
No food no place to stay and

00:34:27.131 --> 00:34:29.167

with applying to cal fresh.

00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:44.949
All of these Alonso weekly

00:34:45.016 --> 00:34:46.784
meetings with Daniel Monning is

00:34:46.851 --> 00:34:48.886
one of our case managers to

00:34:48.953 --> 00:34:51.189
assess my immediate and changing

00:34:51.255 --> 00:34:52.790
needs.

00:34:52.857 --> 00:34:55.059
At three point eight GPA dean's

00:34:55.126 --> 00:34:55.660
on our list student how also

00:34:55.726 --> 00:34:57.161

00:34:57.228 --> 00:34:58.796
failure.

00:34:58.863 --> 00:35:00.832
As paralyzed with fear after an

00:35:00.898 --> 00:35:02.767
incident of stalking harassment

00:35:02.834 --> 00:35:03.401
from my abuser here on campus.

00:35:03.468 --> 00:35:05.136
So I stopped attending classes

00:35:05.203 --> 00:35:08.940
he gave himself farm how lost

00:35:09.006 --> 00:35:10.808
sight of the day I graduate.

00:35:10.875 --> 00:35:12.777
The people at this university

00:35:12.844 --> 00:35:13.377
including Daniel Monning aus

00:35:13.444 --> 00:35:15.112
that's less than and also

00:35:15.179 --> 00:35:15.480
anything right.

00:35:15.546 --> 00:35:16.814
Just to name a few.

00:35:16.881 --> 00:35:17.415

information of resources in the

00:35:19.784 --> 00:35:21.085
community like we've and my

00:35:21.152 --> 00:35:21.452
sister's house.

00:35:21.519 --> 00:35:22.954
Received an emergency fund from

00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:23.588
the university I was connected

00:35:23.654 --> 00:35:25.089
with someone in the community

00:35:25.156 --> 00:35:26.924

00:35:26.991 --> 00:35:28.993
spring semester what and last

00:35:29.060 --> 00:35:29.193
year.

00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:30.862
This whole thing counseling

00:35:30.928 --> 00:35:32.964
services listen to what I have

00:35:33.030 --> 00:35:33.598
to say about my mental health.

00:35:33.664 --> 00:35:35.366
After my own doctors in the

00:35:35.433 --> 00:35:37.168
community rejected and

00:35:37.235 --> 00:35:39.303
stigmatize the word that came

00:35:39.370 --> 00:35:40.905
out of my mouth.

00:35:40.972 --> 00:35:43.040
This university help me when the

00:35:43.107 --> 00:35:43.708
greater Sacramento community let

00:35:43.774 --> 00:35:45.376
me down it's so easy to tell our

00:35:45.443 --> 00:35:47.645
students. To go find a job be

00:35:47.712 --> 00:35:48.279
responsible and pull themselves

00:35:48.346 --> 00:35:50.248
out of their basic needs

00:35:50.314 --> 00:35:52.316
struggles but you know what a

00:35:52.383 --> 00:35:54.485
full time student with a part

00:35:54.552 --> 00:35:55.119
time job working nights to talk

00:35:55.186 --> 00:35:56.621
about.

00:35:56.687 --> 00:35:57.321
And then riding their bike home

00:35:57.388 --> 00:35:59.490
at three in the morning is that

00:35:59.557 --> 00:36:01.626
going to get them very far.

00:36:01.692 --> 00:36:04.195
Employers give too little errors

00:36:04.262 --> 00:36:06.297
to their students employees and

00:36:06.364 --> 00:36:06.931
the housing market is beyond

00:36:06.998 --> 00:36:08.799
reach for at many young adults

00:36:08.866 --> 00:36:09.433
try to make it through school

00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:13.304
without financial support from

00:36:13.371 --> 00:36:15.039
their family.

00:36:15.106 --> 00:36:15.606
I've been emergency housing

00:36:15.673 --> 00:36:16.941
twice now.

00:36:17.008 --> 00:36:23.047
I was I received the find. To

00:36:23.114 --> 00:36:23.581
make their own needs me.

00:36:23.648 --> 00:36:25.550
I to make their own -- Ends meet

00:36:25.616 --> 00:36:27.318
when it comes to housing and

00:36:27.385 --> 00:36:29.287
community members who agree to

00:36:29.353 --> 00:36:31.188
house you don't want you coming

00:36:31.255 --> 00:36:31.789
home at three in the morning

00:36:31.856 --> 00:36:33.391
from your seven hour shift that

00:36:33.457 --> 00:36:33.691
talk about.

00:36:33.758 --> 00:36:35.359
So they tell you that it's not

00:36:35.426 --> 00:36:37.161
working out anymore and then you

00:36:37.228 --> 00:36:39.130
find yourself back at the mercy

00:36:39.196 --> 00:36:39.564
of the university.

00:36:39.630 --> 00:36:41.465
I was going to take time off

00:36:41.532 --> 00:36:43.167
from school to work at talk

00:36:43.234 --> 00:36:44.902
about so that I could afford my

00:36:44.969 --> 00:36:46.904
rent and other bills and today

00:36:46.971 --> 00:36:48.906
here I am. Eighteen units away

00:36:48.973 --> 00:36:51.142
from graduating no longer facing

00:36:51.208 --> 00:36:53.344
academic probation and slowly

00:36:53.411 --> 00:36:53.878
resuscitating my GPA for

00:36:53.945 --> 00:36:55.346
graduate school.

00:36:55.413 --> 00:36:57.181
I could have easily fallen Tom

00:36:57.248 --> 00:37:01.218
thought minimum wage tropical

00:37:01.285 --> 00:37:01.552
but I didn't.

00:37:01.619 --> 00:37:03.421
Because of the people here the

00:37:03.487 --> 00:37:05.356
sacrament Steve Kerr's office if

00:37:05.423 --> 00:37:07.291
I. food pantry and health and

00:37:07.358 --> 00:37:07.758
counseling services.

00:37:07.825 --> 00:37:09.327
Now I can finally keep working

00:37:09.393 --> 00:37:11.195
on my degree go to law school

00:37:11.262 --> 00:37:13.030
and get back to the community by

00:37:13.097 --> 00:37:13.598
advocating for marginalized

00:37:13.664 --> 00:37:14.932
groups.

00:37:14.999 --> 00:37:17.101
And I think that my story is a

00:37:17.168 --> 00:37:17.768
penny of author Allen -- Brown's

00:37:17.835 --> 00:37:19.303
plastic saying that you cannot

00:37:19.370 --> 00:37:23.374
pour from an empty vessel thank

00:37:23.441 --> 00:37:25.109
you [inaudible]

00:37:25.176 --> 00:37:33.017

You were one strong person

00:37:39.290 --> 00:37:39.523

And yeah out of this difficulty

00:37:43.327 --> 00:37:45.496
and at eighteen minutes you're

00:37:45.563 --> 00:37:46.931

00:37:51.736 --> 00:37:53.070
interesting.

00:37:53.137 --> 00:37:55.039
About your story is that if we

00:37:55.106 --> 00:37:56.907

00:37:56.974 --> 00:37:57.208
[inaudible]

00:37:57.274 --> 00:38:01.245
From now -- I hope that you will

A more powerful advocate for

00:38:07.585 --> 00:38:09.186
those who share the same

00:38:09.253 --> 00:38:11.255
experiences that you have here

00:38:11.322 --> 00:38:11.856
because they're not unique you

00:38:11.922 --> 00:38:13.090
know.

00:38:13.157 --> 00:38:15.026

And that.

00:38:21.465 --> 00:38:23.300

00:39:43.314 --> 00:39:45.082
And I am.

00:39:45.149 --> 00:39:47.485
Honored to be a student here I'm

00:39:47.551 --> 00:39:49.420
formerly incarcerated and I'm

00:39:49.487 --> 00:39:53.124
former foster use I grew up in

00:39:53.190 --> 00:39:55.059
the system and when I

00:39:55.126 --> 00:39:57.128
transferred to sac state I was

00:39:57.194 --> 00:39:59.096
almost out of financial aid

00:39:59.163 --> 00:40:01.232
because I had.

00:40:01.298 --> 00:40:03.134
Basically taught myself to learn

00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:05.369
to read and write and had.

00:40:05.436 --> 00:40:07.238
To had to tighten up those

00:40:07.304 --> 00:40:09.373
skills and community college so

00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:09.774
when I got here.

00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:11.509
I had about a year left a

00:40:11.575 --> 00:40:13.477
financial aid and if it weren't

00:40:13.544 --> 00:40:15.379
for the cal grants in the

00:40:15.446 --> 00:40:17.281
university grants.

00:40:17.348 --> 00:40:19.183
I wouldn't have.

00:40:19.250 --> 00:40:21.185
Even been able to start.

00:40:21.252 --> 00:40:23.354
And within about two years I was

00:40:23.420 --> 00:40:25.456
facing homelessness and I was at

00:40:25.523 --> 00:40:27.391
a point where.

00:40:27.458 --> 00:40:27.992
I was going to have to leave

00:40:28.058 --> 00:40:30.127
school because I couldn't afford

00:40:30.194 --> 00:40:32.329
the seven or eight hundred

00:40:32.396 --> 00:40:35.399
dollars extra -- On top of the

00:40:35.466 --> 00:40:37.434
grant to stay in school every

00:40:37.501 --> 00:40:37.701
semester.

00:40:37.768 --> 00:40:39.603
And I started reaching out and

00:40:39.670 --> 00:40:43.140
found guardian scholars program

00:40:43.207 --> 00:40:43.607
and project rebound.

00:40:43.674 --> 00:40:45.509
And without those programs I

00:40:45.576 --> 00:40:47.244
wouldn't be in school today

00:40:47.311 --> 00:40:49.380
graduating in just a few weeks.

00:40:49.446 --> 00:40:54.118
And and this campus has been

00:40:54.185 --> 00:40:59.390
like a home to me and I really

00:40:59.456 --> 00:41:00.958
just want to say that I have

00:41:01.025 --> 00:41:03.260
utilized the pantry many times

00:41:03.327 --> 00:41:05.362
and still to this day I get my

00:41:05.429 --> 00:41:05.996
food from a food bank because I

00:41:06.063 --> 00:41:09.233
am on SSI disability and I'm not

00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:13.137
allowed to get -- Cal works of

00:41:13.204 --> 00:41:15.239
what is it called the the help

00:41:15.306 --> 00:41:15.873
right for food they won't give

00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:17.174
it to us.

00:41:17.241 --> 00:41:19.443
So when I have forty dollars and

00:41:19.510 --> 00:41:21.378
left every month for groceries

00:41:21.445 --> 00:41:23.514
many times I have to spend out

00:41:23.581 --> 00:41:25.349
on gas to get to school.

00:41:25.416 --> 00:41:27.551
And I would rather do that

00:41:27.618 --> 00:41:29.453
because school is so important

00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:31.188
to me.

00:41:31.255 --> 00:41:33.290
It's it's my life I have almost

00:41:33.357 --> 00:41:37.328

00:41:37.394 --> 00:41:39.296
maintained that through.

00:41:39.363 --> 00:41:39.964
Every single struggle that I've

00:41:40.030 --> 00:41:41.532
gone through and I have raised

00:41:41.599 --> 00:41:45.402
my grandchildren on my own -- I

00:41:45.469 --> 00:41:47.304

An abusive relationship and gone

00:41:49.540 --> 00:41:51.308

of the Sacramento community and

00:43:39.416 --> 00:43:40.017
I think that -- There's still a

00:43:40.084 --> 00:43:41.685
lot to be done in terms of

00:43:41.752 --> 00:43:43.721

00:46:25.883 --> 00:46:26.483
different because I'm a transfer

00:46:26.550 --> 00:46:29.052
student -- After I graduated

00:46:29.119 --> 00:46:30.187
high school I went to the

00:46:30.254 --> 00:46:32.055
meeting Holly spurs and I

00:46:32.122 --> 00:46:33.590
communicable is I was never

00:46:33.657 --> 00:46:37.694
really involved -- I didn't

00:46:37.761 --> 00:46:38.295
really know how to or I didn't

00:46:38.362 --> 00:46:39.663
know the like and what to get

00:46:39.730 --> 00:46:40.197
involved in or or I didn't

00:46:40.264 --> 00:46:41.498
really see.

00:46:41.565 --> 00:46:43.767
Any kind of like anything for me

00:46:43.834 --> 00:46:45.435
you know I mean so.

00:46:45.502 --> 00:46:46.069
So a committee college I didn't

00:46:46.136 --> 00:46:47.871
really get involved -- Actually

00:46:47.938 --> 00:46:49.740
de I stopped going to committee

00:46:49.806 --> 00:46:50.374
college because my family was

00:46:50.440 --> 00:46:53.410
going to a financial hardship --

00:46:53.477 --> 00:46:54.044
It was only me my sister my mom

00:46:54.111 --> 00:46:55.679
so that was kind of one of the

00:46:55.746 --> 00:46:57.481
hardest parts of my life was --

00:46:57.548 --> 00:47:01.418
My mom was working like two jobs --

00:47:01.485 --> 00:47:03.487
My fishes finishing high school --

00:47:03.554 --> 00:47:05.455
I'm trying to work.

00:47:05.522 --> 00:47:07.591
Part Wilk full time and full

00:47:07.658 --> 00:47:08.192
time student which was really

00:47:08.258 --> 00:47:09.826
you know really hard for me

00:47:09.893 --> 00:47:11.461
because I was a child my mom out.

00:47:11.528 --> 00:47:13.630
With pan around her bills -- And

00:47:13.697 --> 00:47:15.532
things like that so that was I

00:47:15.599 --> 00:47:17.701
was a financial hardship that we

00:47:17.768 --> 00:47:18.335
went there was actually dropped

00:47:18.402 --> 00:47:19.002
out of school for about a year.

00:47:19.069 --> 00:47:21.605
And it was.

00:47:21.672 --> 00:47:23.640
Interesting because I got to see

00:47:23.707 --> 00:47:25.876
the perspective of light will my

00:47:25.943 --> 00:47:29.646
wife could be at if I didn't you

00:47:29.713 --> 00:47:31.548
know come back to school -- I

00:47:31.615 --> 00:47:32.182
saw myself I was working in the

00:47:32.249 --> 00:47:35.652
construction zone -- I don't

00:47:35.719 --> 00:47:36.286
think I mentioned it but I am

00:47:36.353 --> 00:47:38.055
with -- Doctor students I am a

00:47:38.121 --> 00:47:41.692
dreamer -- So I was facing like

00:47:41.758 --> 00:47:43.727
on top of everything that I was

00:47:43.794 --> 00:47:45.729
facing like I have Bates -- Just

00:47:45.796 --> 00:47:47.564
like.

00:47:47.631 --> 00:47:49.666
Everything else with the country --

00:47:49.733 --> 00:47:50.334
Because I was brought here when

00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:52.069
I was like four years old and it

00:47:52.135 --> 00:47:55.539
was not like it's not like I had --

00:47:55.606 --> 00:47:57.541
A say in the light coming to the

00:47:57.608 --> 00:47:59.543
US is just you know my parents

00:47:59.610 --> 00:48:00.177
ended up bringing here -- For a

00:48:00.244 --> 00:48:01.712
better life [inaudible]

00:48:01.778 --> 00:48:05.649
So -- Once I saw my life in the

00:48:05.716 --> 00:48:06.250
construction zone you know my

00:48:06.316 --> 00:48:07.551
body was really deteriorating I

00:48:07.618 --> 00:48:09.553
was actually doing a demolition.

00:48:09.620 --> 00:48:11.555
So it was just like.

00:48:11.622 --> 00:48:12.222
Our word we can about like where

00:48:12.289 --> 00:48:15.626
I am coming back home at like

00:48:15.692 --> 00:48:17.728
six PM then literally eating and

00:48:17.794 --> 00:48:19.630
then go back to sleep -- But I

00:48:19.696 --> 00:48:20.197
did that for about a year.

00:48:20.264 --> 00:48:23.567
And I saw my wife and I was like.

00:48:23.634 --> 00:48:24.201
You know I don't do this forever

00:48:24.268 --> 00:48:26.069
I don't want to do this for all

00:48:26.136 --> 00:48:27.537
they need to go back to school --

00:48:27.604 --> 00:48:29.539
I went back to college finished

00:48:29.606 --> 00:48:33.577
of any college.

00:48:33.644 --> 00:48:34.211
Thanks a and honestly like I say

00:48:34.278 --> 00:48:35.579
like.

00:48:35.646 --> 00:48:36.179
I one of the best things I've

00:48:36.246 --> 00:48:37.714
ever done in my life -- I want

00:48:37.781 --> 00:48:38.382
to think like all the back until

00:48:38.448 --> 00:48:41.718
the staff on and any student

00:48:41.785 --> 00:48:43.553
there's now it's like.

00:48:43.620 --> 00:48:44.187
Of the five stages provides that

00:48:44.254 --> 00:48:47.557
like.

00:48:47.624 --> 00:48:49.693
W. I. N. even like I'm from

00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:50.260
Sacramento on like even when

00:48:50.327 --> 00:48:51.928
Mike I'm not at home like I'm a

00:48:51.995 --> 00:48:53.563
home here.

00:48:53.630 --> 00:48:55.599
And like for me like I spend SXT

00:48:55.666 --> 00:48:57.567
like at least.

00:48:57.634 --> 00:48:59.770
Like on a day to you know

00:48:59.836 --> 00:49:01.605
bouncing on my classes my work --

00:49:01.672 --> 00:49:03.607

00:49:09.646 --> 00:49:11.782
Zero eight PM I don't know

00:49:11.848 --> 00:49:13.817
whatever time but I just want to

00:49:13.884 --> 00:49:15.585
say like.

00:49:15.652 --> 00:49:16.253
The the program they really help

00:49:16.320 --> 00:49:17.921
me out with a dream research

00:49:17.988 --> 00:49:18.555
centering on campus -- When I

00:49:18.622 --> 00:49:19.823
transferred over I really had no

00:49:19.890 --> 00:49:21.725
idea on?

00:49:21.792 --> 00:49:23.560
On a lot of things -- Just.

00:49:23.627 --> 00:49:24.194
I was kind of going into a long

00:49:24.261 --> 00:49:25.996
so once I came in -- The Jim

00:49:26.063 --> 00:49:27.898
research center actually really

00:49:27.964 --> 00:49:28.365
helped me out into.

00:49:28.432 --> 00:49:29.933
A whether it's financial aid it

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:31.902
was getting -- I actually got.

00:49:31.968 --> 00:49:33.904
I didn't apply for the the

00:49:33.970 --> 00:49:36.073
hooting Rampone for the one that

00:49:36.139 --> 00:49:37.841
says they but I did apply to the

00:49:37.908 --> 00:49:38.508
dream research center they have

00:49:38.575 --> 00:49:39.843
their own personal -- One so

00:49:39.910 --> 00:49:41.645
they did help me in order to get

00:49:41.712 --> 00:49:42.212
paper schools for the first

00:49:42.279 --> 00:49:43.680
semester.

00:49:43.747 --> 00:49:47.684
I think that was really.

00:49:47.751 --> 00:49:48.318
Like I was really grateful that

00:49:48.385 --> 00:49:49.820
they were able to do that for me --

00:49:49.886 --> 00:49:50.454
The only thing that I want to

00:49:50.520 --> 00:49:51.822
say like I hope you guys take

00:49:51.888 --> 00:49:55.759
into consideration -- Those next

00:49:55.826 --> 00:49:56.393
wave of students are going to be

00:49:56.460 --> 00:49:57.961
coming in -- Because we don't

00:49:58.028 --> 00:49:59.763
know that right now like as does

00:49:59.830 --> 00:50:00.330
the United States like the

00:50:00.397 --> 00:50:01.732
policy Bob like they're not

00:50:01.798 --> 00:50:02.399
accepting new recipients for the

00:50:02.466 --> 00:50:05.669
doctor dreamers the so.

00:50:05.736 --> 00:50:07.971
All those -- Like students are

00:50:08.038 --> 00:50:09.840
gonna be coming in.

00:50:09.906 --> 00:50:11.675
Into a light.

00:50:11.742 --> 00:50:12.275
Whether they want to go to

00:50:12.342 --> 00:50:13.844
college or not like they might

00:50:13.910 --> 00:50:15.645
not have the opportunity because

00:50:15.712 --> 00:50:19.649
like they're not accepting --

00:50:19.716 --> 00:50:21.785
The like the the mac

00:50:21.852 --> 00:50:23.754
applications so in order to do

00:50:23.820 --> 00:50:25.889
receive you make you must have

00:50:25.956 --> 00:50:26.456
like a five five bill I'm.

00:50:26.523 --> 00:50:27.958
I believe and if you're not like

00:50:28.024 --> 00:50:29.826
receiving any financial aid then

00:50:29.893 --> 00:50:31.995
like all those new wave of

00:50:32.062 --> 00:50:32.362
students that.

00:50:32.429 --> 00:50:33.997
Are not able to apply propelled

00:50:34.064 --> 00:50:35.799
rounds they're not able -- To

00:50:35.866 --> 00:50:37.834
get like scholarship defining

00:50:37.901 --> 00:50:39.669
for them just because

00:50:39.736 --> 00:50:41.738
technically they're undocumented --

00:50:41.805 --> 00:50:42.339
Compared to me where I'm I'm a

00:50:42.406 --> 00:50:44.040
little bit you know I'm really

00:50:44.107 --> 00:50:45.742

00:50:45.809 --> 00:50:47.711
opportunity to to be able to

00:50:47.778 --> 00:50:49.846
apply and get most of it paid

00:50:49.913 --> 00:50:51.648
although I don't get it all but

00:50:51.715 --> 00:50:53.984

wanted to mention that there is

00:51:20.744 --> 00:51:21.845
a proposal.

00:51:21.912 --> 00:51:23.980
In the legislative for twenty

rapid re housing for college

00:51:26.316 --> 00:51:28.084
students that students would let

00:51:28.151 --> 00:51:30.153
me support on and then also I

00:51:30.220 --> 00:51:36.126
had a question for stern

00:51:36.193 --> 00:51:37.794

00:51:37.861 --> 00:51:39.896
So I don't know.

00:51:39.963 --> 00:51:41.965
Yeah he had to get to a budget

00:51:42.032 --> 00:51:42.399

00:51:51.842 --> 00:51:52.142
of attendance.

00:51:52.209 --> 00:51:54.211
How will that will solve the

00:51:54.277 --> 00:51:55.812
specific issue?

00:51:55.879 --> 00:51:59.783

00:52:01.885 --> 00:52:05.789
Thank you Cynthia okay yes Sir.

I'm graduating in two weeks with

00:52:08.091 --> 00:52:08.592
a masters of public policy

00:52:08.658 --> 00:52:09.826
administration I just wanted to

00:52:09.893 --> 00:52:10.460
briefly discuss some policies.

00:52:10.527 --> 00:52:11.127
I'm also currently serving as a

00:52:11.194 --> 00:52:11.995
research assistant to UC regent

00:52:12.062 --> 00:52:12.362
Michael Cohen.

00:52:12.429 --> 00:52:14.097
So I've been studying basic

00:52:14.164 --> 00:52:14.731
needs for him for the last few

00:52:14.798 --> 00:52:16.166
months and so I wanted to share

00:52:16.233 --> 00:52:17.901
some of the things I've learned

00:52:17.968 --> 00:52:19.769
at the UC is doing that's also

00:52:19.836 --> 00:52:20.303
relevant to this issue and

00:52:20.370 --> 00:52:23.874
community colleges so -- It's

00:52:23.940 --> 00:52:25.909
not the same Mike it is yeah

00:52:25.976 --> 00:52:28.044
remember doctor finance mobile

00:52:28.111 --> 00:52:31.815
going.

00:52:31.882 --> 00:52:32.415
Not Donald trump's microphone

00:52:32.482 --> 00:52:37.821
right.

00:52:37.888 --> 00:52:41.825
Norris so.

00:52:41.892 --> 00:52:43.860
So I think that we need to

00:52:43.927 --> 00:52:44.494
continue working to get the cal

00:52:44.561 --> 00:52:45.929
fresh application into the

00:52:45.996 --> 00:52:48.198
financial aid process on the way

00:52:48.265 --> 00:52:49.966
we're signing up students.

00:52:50.033 --> 00:52:52.168
Finding a legibility up front.

00:52:52.235 --> 00:52:54.104
And we need to continue working

00:52:54.170 --> 00:52:54.738
that until we can instill that

00:52:54.804 --> 00:52:55.939
federally under a different

00:52:56.006 --> 00:52:56.540
administration when it becomes

00:52:56.606 --> 00:52:57.974
more friendly to do -- I think

00:52:58.041 --> 00:52:58.575
that's something that we need

00:52:58.642 --> 00:52:59.843
our state leaders to push the

00:52:59.910 --> 00:53:01.811
next secretary of education.

00:53:01.878 --> 00:53:04.047
Under democratic -- Leadership

00:53:04.114 --> 00:53:07.817
to do -- I think next is.

00:53:07.884 --> 00:53:08.485
Once we are able to scale up how

00:53:08.552 --> 00:53:10.253
fresh we need to be able to make

00:53:10.320 --> 00:53:11.788
sure our counties have the

00:53:11.855 --> 00:53:12.322
capability to do it some

00:53:12.389 --> 00:53:12.956
counties have outdated software

00:53:13.023 --> 00:53:14.190
systems aren't able to do it

00:53:14.257 --> 00:53:15.959
others just don't have the

00:53:16.026 --> 00:53:16.493
manpower political well.

00:53:16.560 --> 00:53:18.295
That's something I've seen

00:53:18.361 --> 00:53:20.030
through the U. sees that they've

00:53:20.096 --> 00:53:21.831
experienced a couple of counties.

00:53:21.898 --> 00:53:26.002
So -- They think.

00:53:26.069 --> 00:53:26.603
Moreover we've been consistent

00:53:26.670 --> 00:53:28.238
baseline of services the UC is

00:53:28.305 --> 00:53:30.040
trying to deal with this right

00:53:30.106 --> 00:53:30.607
and that right now in their

00:53:30.674 --> 00:53:32.075
funding allocation -- I think

00:53:32.142 --> 00:53:32.275
that.

00:53:32.342 --> 00:53:34.311
Last week's L. airport one basic

00:53:34.377 --> 00:53:37.948
needs for the U. sees -- The

00:53:38.014 --> 00:53:39.916
governor's proposed budget on it.

00:53:39.983 --> 00:53:42.018
It rightly points out the

00:53:42.085 --> 00:53:42.552
inconsistent inconsistency

00:53:42.619 --> 00:53:44.187
unfairness between community

00:53:44.254 --> 00:53:46.323
colleges and C. issues with what

00:53:46.389 --> 00:53:47.991
the C. issues down so far.

00:53:48.058 --> 00:53:48.558
A granite they've got their

00:53:48.625 --> 00:53:50.293
research models and everything

00:53:50.360 --> 00:53:50.927
but we need to make sure we get

00:53:50.994 --> 00:53:52.128
those baseline services up

00:53:52.195 --> 00:53:53.930
across the board.

00:53:53.997 --> 00:53:55.899
Especially because of the need

00:53:55.966 --> 00:53:58.034
this disproportionate me -- And

00:53:58.101 --> 00:54:00.036
lastly housing is by far the

00:54:00.103 --> 00:54:04.040
biggest challenge that we face

00:54:04.107 --> 00:54:04.641
in the whole state facing it.

00:54:04.708 --> 00:54:06.376
And I think that if you're all

00:54:06.443 --> 00:54:06.610
about.

00:54:06.676 --> 00:54:08.311
Finding efficiency in the state

00:54:08.378 --> 00:54:10.146
dollars you start looking at off

00:54:10.213 --> 00:54:11.881
campus shared housing between

00:54:11.948 --> 00:54:12.215
the systems.

00:54:12.282 --> 00:54:14.317
So some of our communities

00:54:14.384 --> 00:54:15.919
across the state.

00:54:15.986 --> 00:54:17.887
Those opportunities exist

00:54:17.954 --> 00:54:19.923
Sacramento San Diego bay area.

00:54:19.990 --> 00:54:22.225
You could put off campus housing

00:54:22.292 --> 00:54:23.927
in west Iraq.

00:54:23.994 --> 00:54:26.029
Into the transportation network

00:54:26.096 --> 00:54:28.064
being students to Sacramento and

00:54:28.131 --> 00:54:30.033
also to Davis into Los Rios.

00:54:30.100 --> 00:54:33.903
As well so so I can use to exist

00:54:33.970 --> 00:54:34.471
I would like to see you guys

00:54:34.537 --> 00:54:34.838
great weather.

00:54:34.904 --> 00:54:35.972
You can also use the **** to

00:54:36.039 --> 00:54:40.043
facilitate that because cancel

00:54:40.110 --> 00:54:40.610
government government's yes

00:54:40.677 --> 00:54:44.180
great you're Mike thank you

00:54:44.247 --> 00:54:47.984
thanks for being here thank

00:54:48.051 --> 00:54:48.284
[inaudible]

00:54:48.351 --> 00:54:51.921
Yes ma'am.

00:54:51.988 --> 00:54:52.489
Hello -- Thank you for the

00:54:52.555 --> 00:54:56.126
opportunity. To talk to you guys.

00:54:56.192 --> 00:54:56.660
A young lady reporter and

00:54:56.726 --> 00:54:58.161
everything inside of me and your

00:54:58.228 --> 00:54:59.896
story is completely inspiring

00:54:59.963 --> 00:55:01.998
and thank you for sharing your

00:55:02.065 --> 00:55:04.401
story -- For myself -- I would

00:55:04.467 --> 00:55:06.202
like to think that I'm not your

00:55:06.269 --> 00:55:08.171
typical student -- High school

00:55:08.238 --> 00:55:11.908
drop out -- Get your diploma at

00:55:11.975 --> 00:55:13.977
twenty one teenage mother --

00:55:14.044 --> 00:55:17.914
Starting school in your thirties --

00:55:17.981 --> 00:55:18.581
On every subsidized program that

00:55:18.648 --> 00:55:22.185
they have to offer -- When I

00:55:22.252 --> 00:55:26.056
came I'm a transfer student --

00:55:26.122 --> 00:55:28.024
When I started school at the --

00:55:28.091 --> 00:55:30.226
Junior college -- I didn't

00:55:30.293 --> 00:55:32.062
really go to graduate but yet

00:55:32.128 --> 00:55:34.431
here I am -- I was encouraged to

00:55:34.497 --> 00:55:36.032
come to Saks state.

00:55:36.099 --> 00:55:38.234
My first semester was. To say

00:55:38.301 --> 00:55:40.403
the least -- What I wanted to

00:55:40.470 --> 00:55:44.140
expand this story at -- Amazing

00:55:44.207 --> 00:55:46.109
yet.

00:55:46.176 --> 00:55:50.013
Tremendously scary a semester --

00:55:50.080 --> 00:55:50.580
I start off this semester.

00:55:50.647 --> 00:55:52.482
Before the semester even started

00:55:52.549 --> 00:55:54.451
I found out I had breast cancer

00:55:54.517 --> 00:55:56.019
so I had to go through this

00:55:56.086 --> 00:55:58.021
whole surgery thing and I was

00:55:58.088 --> 00:55:58.288
like I'm.

00:55:58.354 --> 00:56:00.356
One I came this far nothing's

00:56:00.423 --> 00:56:02.125
gonna breast cancer is not gonna

00:56:02.192 --> 00:56:04.094
stop me that was my attitude --

00:56:04.160 --> 00:56:06.229
So -- Needless to say -- I went

00:56:06.296 --> 00:56:08.431
to the and when I went to that

00:56:08.498 --> 00:56:10.433
process -- We work financially

00:56:10.500 --> 00:56:16.139
ready. To to to to go through

00:56:16.206 --> 00:56:20.076
the medical issues that -- I had

00:56:20.143 --> 00:56:22.245
I will I'm on that and the

00:56:22.312 --> 00:56:24.247
sacramental -- Section eight

00:56:24.314 --> 00:56:26.416
program and so my income with my

00:56:26.483 --> 00:56:28.151
rate was low at the time.

00:56:28.218 --> 00:56:28.785
When I decide to come back to

00:56:28.852 --> 00:56:30.420
school I had to pick up extra

00:56:30.487 --> 00:56:34.090
jobs and so I worked a lot to

00:56:34.157 --> 00:56:34.691
try to catch up for all those

00:56:34.758 --> 00:56:34.924
bills?

00:56:34.991 --> 00:56:38.094
That was behind so -- When it

00:56:38.161 --> 00:56:40.029
was time to submit my income

00:56:40.096 --> 00:56:40.663
they said -- Good you can pay

00:56:40.730 --> 00:56:48.171
more rent and they went from.

00:56:48.238 --> 00:56:48.805
Four hundred to fourteen hundred

00:56:48.872 --> 00:56:50.340
and it within a month a couple

00:56:50.406 --> 00:56:50.940
of months I had to figure out

00:56:51.007 --> 00:56:52.142
how to pay that we although I

00:56:52.208 --> 00:56:52.742
didn't have the income to do

00:56:52.809 --> 00:56:56.212
that which landed me in a

00:56:56.279 --> 00:56:58.348
position where -- León homeless

00:56:58.414 --> 00:57:00.383
was a threat -- That wouldn't

00:57:00.450 --> 00:57:02.118
have been the first time I've

00:57:02.185 --> 00:57:02.786
been homeless before but I don't

00:57:02.852 --> 00:57:04.521
need to go back that far this is

00:57:04.587 --> 00:57:08.324
curry -- Currently -- I'm in the

00:57:08.391 --> 00:57:10.527
process of trying to figure out

00:57:10.593 --> 00:57:12.262
how.

00:57:12.328 --> 00:57:12.796
To fight to have policies

00:57:12.862 --> 00:57:14.531
changed because I have friends

00:57:14.597 --> 00:57:16.599
that's going to transfer here in

00:57:16.666 --> 00:57:18.334
their mothers with children and

00:57:18.401 --> 00:57:20.303
you know we have to work and

00:57:20.370 --> 00:57:20.904
we're not your average still

00:57:20.970 --> 00:57:22.739
naked take fifteen units we you

00:57:22.806 --> 00:57:24.641
know some of us have to take six

00:57:24.707 --> 00:57:26.242
units. Four nine units on the

00:57:26.309 --> 00:57:28.344
I'm on twelve units right now

00:57:28.411 --> 00:57:28.978
and I'm just like Diane what's

00:57:29.045 --> 00:57:30.613
your major life what's your

00:57:30.680 --> 00:57:32.315
major -- For my bachelors degree

00:57:32.382 --> 00:57:34.350
my goal is deaf studies -- I

00:57:34.417 --> 00:57:36.853
started sign language at the

00:57:36.920 --> 00:57:38.955
junior college -- And I have a

00:57:39.022 --> 00:57:39.589
whole purpose in the rhyme and

00:57:39.656 --> 00:57:41.424
reason for that but I'm here now

00:57:41.491 --> 00:57:43.126
doing that Margolis social work

00:57:43.193 --> 00:57:45.829
for my masters degree.

00:57:45.895 --> 00:57:48.698
And currently when the mind

00:57:48.765 --> 00:57:51.201
frame that I would love to get

00:57:51.267 --> 00:57:53.036
my doctorate degree I decided

00:57:53.102 --> 00:57:54.571
that when I was here.

00:57:54.637 --> 00:57:58.374
You might not agree in sociology

00:57:58.441 --> 00:57:59.008
but you know that I'm being led

00:57:59.075 --> 00:58:00.543
by whatever you know whatever

00:58:00.610 --> 00:58:02.679
way the wind blows but I'm going

00:58:02.745 --> 00:58:04.547
to keep pushing -- I said all I

00:58:04.614 --> 00:58:06.983
have to say is -- I don't know

00:58:07.050 --> 00:58:07.517
what policies and it was

00:58:07.584 --> 00:58:08.151
interesting to see Richard pan

00:58:08.218 --> 00:58:08.818
because I was actually going to

00:58:08.885 --> 00:58:10.353
reach out to his office this

00:58:10.420 --> 00:58:12.522
week -- What policies they have

00:58:12.589 --> 00:58:14.390
for a transition -- Currently

00:58:14.457 --> 00:58:16.559
there's really not a transition

00:58:16.626 --> 00:58:18.528
if you're on section eight if

00:58:18.595 --> 00:58:20.763
you're on how works if you're on

00:58:20.830 --> 00:58:22.465
snap on food stamps.

00:58:22.532 --> 00:58:24.634
You -- You start off at a

00:58:24.701 --> 00:58:26.536
certain level and when you say

00:58:26.603 --> 00:58:28.504
I'm trying to work to do a

00:58:28.571 --> 00:58:29.038
little better they say.

00:58:29.105 --> 00:58:30.740
You can do it yourself and they

00:58:30.807 --> 00:58:34.177
kind of cut off the system.

00:58:34.244 --> 00:58:34.744
Are there are there the way

00:58:34.811 --> 00:58:36.412
their policies is set up they

00:58:36.479 --> 00:58:38.147
just kind of cut to offer they

00:58:38.214 --> 00:58:38.781
around from you know like they

00:58:38.848 --> 00:58:42.452
did with me for four seventy

00:58:42.518 --> 00:58:43.086
four to fourteen hundred with no

00:58:43.152 --> 00:58:43.386
transition.

00:58:43.453 --> 00:58:46.422
And I would like to know -- From --

00:58:46.489 --> 00:58:48.625
While the rich enough his office

00:58:48.691 --> 00:58:50.393
but you guys -- As well how do

00:58:50.460 --> 00:58:52.495
we eliminate that because every

00:58:52.562 --> 00:58:54.530
single time I think about

00:58:54.597 --> 00:58:56.432
quitting college everything

00:58:56.499 --> 00:58:57.033
inside of me falls apart and I

00:58:57.100 --> 00:58:58.801
do struggle with depression and

00:58:58.868 --> 00:59:00.603
anxiety and whenever I think

00:59:00.670 --> 00:59:16.286
about that -- It it.

00:59:16.352 --> 00:59:18.354
That's what it does to me yeah

00:59:18.421 --> 00:59:22.458
because I became so far and I

00:59:22.525 --> 00:59:22.859
don't give that.

00:59:22.926 --> 00:59:25.028
Card to to to have to quit

00:59:25.094 --> 00:59:27.163
because I cannot financially

00:59:27.230 --> 00:59:27.730
afford anything -- God has

00:59:27.797 --> 00:59:28.364
placed me in the in the in the

00:59:28.431 --> 00:59:29.933

gonna give out we have these

00:59:40.109 --> 00:59:44.514

01:01:04.660 --> 01:01:06.396
students are here.

01:01:06.462 --> 01:01:08.731
I think for me growing up --

01:01:08.798 --> 01:01:09.098
Education was.

01:01:09.165 --> 01:01:10.933
Going to school was where I felt

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:12.468
the most liberated. For me it

01:01:12.535 --> 01:01:14.670
was a liberating experience -- I

01:01:14.737 --> 01:01:18.441
don't really understand -- The

01:01:18.508 --> 01:01:20.710
depth of a financial turbulence

01:01:20.777 --> 01:01:22.645
until I came to succeed -- But I

01:01:22.712 --> 01:01:24.680
think that we have such a

01:01:24.747 --> 01:01:25.314
wonderful Hornet family here.

01:01:25.381 --> 01:01:28.384

Thank you so much for creating

01:01:32.522 --> 01:01:32.989
and and working with all.

01:01:33.056 --> 01:01:34.757
Trying to come out all these

01:01:34.824 --> 01:01:36.592
different charges that we're

01:01:36.659 --> 01:01:36.926
we're facing.

01:01:36.993 --> 01:01:38.394
I'm you know I spent the last

01:01:38.461 --> 01:01:40.496
about six seven months just.

01:01:40.563 --> 01:01:41.130
Kind of speaking and and serving

01:01:41.197 --> 01:01:42.732
students and listening to the

01:01:42.799 --> 01:01:46.369
concerns because it's such a a

01:01:46.436 --> 01:01:48.404
part of who I am right now -- I

01:01:48.471 --> 01:01:49.072
I did want to just take out the

01:01:49.138 --> 01:01:49.639
time to say this to students

01:01:49.705 --> 01:01:52.375
because I sometimes we don't --

01:01:52.442 --> 01:01:53.009
We think that we're not enough

01:01:53.076 --> 01:01:54.510
like this upcoming month I will

01:01:54.577 --> 01:01:56.412
be able to pay my rent.

01:01:56.479 --> 01:01:58.481
You just call shipped out I

01:01:58.548 --> 01:01:59.082
receive through inside -- And

01:01:59.148 --> 01:01:59.749
I'm not a four point oh student

01:01:59.816 --> 01:02:00.716
I've actually just been

01:02:00.783 --> 01:02:01.284
struggling immensely for the

01:02:01.350 --> 01:02:02.418
last.

01:02:02.485 --> 01:02:03.052
Year and a half -- Due to not

01:02:03.119 --> 01:02:04.720
being able to find a job but I

01:02:04.787 --> 01:02:06.422
think that we have.

01:02:06.489 --> 01:02:07.090
So much in please and in service

01:02:07.156 --> 01:02:12.395
to help students like me -- But

01:02:12.462 --> 01:02:14.630
it but what but I did want to

01:02:14.697 --> 01:02:15.231
point and see this thought.

01:02:15.298 --> 01:02:16.566
The financial aid -- System

01:02:16.632 --> 01:02:18.534
unfortunately is a broken system

01:02:18.601 --> 01:02:20.570
right we we protect our buttons

01:02:20.636 --> 01:02:21.070
but we don't protect our

01:02:21.137 --> 01:02:22.772
students -- Students coming here

01:02:22.839 --> 01:02:24.607
shouldn't feel and this is

01:02:24.674 --> 01:02:25.074
actually speaking for

01:02:25.141 --> 01:02:28.711
traditional and nontraditional

01:02:28.778 --> 01:02:30.613
students because even if you

01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:32.882
have families are hoping you --

01:02:32.949 --> 01:02:34.650
They're coming out graduating

01:02:34.717 --> 01:02:36.419
with loans.

01:02:36.486 --> 01:02:38.588
And I think that the country

01:02:38.654 --> 01:02:38.921
itself needs.

01:02:38.988 --> 01:02:40.389
To re write the way education

01:02:40.456 --> 01:02:42.391
works the financial aid system

01:02:42.458 --> 01:02:42.592
has.

01:02:42.658 --> 01:02:44.560
Kind of state same place for

01:02:44.627 --> 01:02:45.194
last fifty years I think this is

01:02:45.261 --> 01:02:46.762
what needs to be combat it

01:02:46.829 --> 01:02:48.431
heavily.

01:02:48.498 --> 01:02:50.466
