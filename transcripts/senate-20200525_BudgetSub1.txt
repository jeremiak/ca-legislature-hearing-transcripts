BEFORE WE GET INTO THE AGENDA ITEMS THAT ARE HEARING LET'S ESTABLISH A CORPSMAN SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. SENATOR ROTH. YOUR SENATOR LEYVA YOU'RE LIVING HERE SENATOR MORALE MORALE HERE SECRETARY NOTES A QUORUM HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED I'D LIKE TO WELCOME THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND REPRESENTATIVES OF THE DEPARTMENT WHO ARE ALL PARTICIPATING REMOTELY TODAY LET'S MOVE TO AGENDA PART AA ON K. THROUGH TWELVE EDUCATION. FOR THE FIRST DISCUSSION ITEM. WHICH IS ITEM SIXTY ONE HUNDRED DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION ITEM SIXTY EIGHT SEVENTY CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES ISSUE NUMBER ONE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT OVERALL. BUT DESPITE OF ANALYST'S OFFICE WHO WILL PROVIDE US WITH AN OVERVIEW OF PROP NINETY EIGHT FOR THE FIRST DISCUSSION ITEM. HELLO GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS AND GROUP BROUGHT THE LIVES THAT ARE LOST OFFICE I'M A MY I DID WANT TO JUST PROVIDE YOU SOME BROADER- MEMBERS TOOK TO WALKING THROUGH THE DIFFERENCES ON HIM IN A REVISION COMPARED TO JANUARY ON TO SET UP THE CONTEXT FOR SOME OF THE SUBSEQUENT CONVERSATIONS THAT WILL OCCUR BUT THIS THROUGHOUT THIS HEARING. FIRST IN TERMS OF THE- OVERALL CHANGES IN THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT MINIMUM GUARANTEE OVER THE THREE YEAR PERIOD- THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE IS DOWN SEVENTEEN POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS COMPARED TO THE JANUARY LEVELS. MOST OF THE REDUCTION OF THIRTEEN POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS IS A REDUCTION IN THE MINIMUM GUARANTEED AND IN THE BUDGET YEAR AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THE MAJORITY OF THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE REDUCTION IN THE GUARANTEE IS DUE TO THE R. R. REDUCTIONS IN CITY GENERAL FUND REVENUES AS A RESULT OF THE STATE NOW I'M INTRIGUED. I WOULD NOTE THOUGH THAT- THE MINIMUM GUARANTEED A CALCULATION DOES INCLUDE FOUR AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS IN REVENUES FROM NEW PROPOSALS OF THE ADMINISTRATION OUR- NEW REVENUE PROPOSALS THAT THE RESTRICTION OF COUPLES OF ME REVISION. I'M WITHOUT THOSE ARE PROPOSALS I GUARANTEE WOULD BE ABOUT ANOTHER ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS LOWER. I DID- IT- BLUE OVERALL NINETY NUMBERS AND THE STORY SOME OF REMOTE CONTROL AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES. I DID JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT FOR THE PURPOSES OF- K. TWELVE FUNDING BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THOSE ARE THE NEXT ISSUES THAT WILL BE IN OUR DISCUSSION- THE STORE IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT ONCE YOU INCORPORATE. A VARIETY OF OTHER FUNDING SOURCES THAT ARE PART OF ME REVISION- SO- AND PART OF THE MITIGATING ACTIONS THAT ARE OCCURRING SO WE THINK WHEN YOU LOOK AT. A VARIETY OF OTHER ACTIONS THAT ARE GOING ON SCHOOL FUNDING IS ROUGHLY FLAT IN THE MIRROR VISION FROM THE- REVISED TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY LEVEL TO WHAT'S IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AND THAT'S FOR A NUMBER OF FACTORS- FIRST OF ALL. ANY OF THE REDUCTION THAT ARE IN THE MAYOR'S. ARGUABLY ASKED. FOR I'M IN BED IT'S A TOTAL OF FIVE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN THE CURRENT AND BUDGET YEAR- THAT- BUT- IN DEFERRALS FOR OUR SCHOOLS. WHAT THAT MEANS WHEN THE STATE IMPLEMENT THE DEFERRAL INSTEAD OF OUR- OWN. AMERICAN VALUES MUSIC SCHOOL DISTRICTS CAN USE INTO THEIR CASH RESERVES. OR THEY CAN GO OUT TO THE MARKET AND BORROW FUNDING AT RELATIVELY LOW INTEREST RATES IN ORDER TO. CONTINUE TO OPERATE PROGRAMS. AT THEIR CURRENT LEVELS. I'M I MADE SO THE SAY ANY TO ME RETURN. FROM THE OTHERS THE OTHER- NOTABLE ACTION HERE IS FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IN. FEDERAL FUNDING THAT IS. SORT OF A DISCRETIONARY BUT THE STATE HAS DECIDED THAT THE MERE VISION IS PROPOSING TO PROVIDE TO SCHOOLS- BUT IS NOT REQUIRED TO BE ON. OVERALL THERE'S ABOUT FIVE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS GOING UP TO SCHOOLS. IN TO READY A FUN SOURCES THAT ARE ARE. RELATIVELY FLEXIBLE FOR THEM. FROM ONE POINT ONE POINT FORTY FIVE BILLION IS FROM THE- FEDERAL CHARACTER GONNA GO ALL BASED ON THE TITLE ONE PARTY FORMULA. THE STATE. DOESN'T HAVE MUCH CONTROL OVER. I'M GOOD AT ALL AND FUNDING IS GOING UP BASED ON FORMULA BUT THE MAIN REASON DOES INCLUDE POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IN. REVENUE THAT'S COMING FROM A CARRIAGE ACT THAT COULD BE USED FOR A VARIETY OF PURPOSES AND THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS CHOSEN TO USE. OR SCHOOL SPECIFICALLY. AND FOR THE LEARNING LOSS MITIGATION GRANT WHICH I KNOW IS A SEPARATE ITEM ON YOUR DISCUSSION. THE OTHER NOTABLE ARE. ISSUES THAT ARE PUT OUT IN TERMS OF HAVING PHYSICAL EFFECT ON SCHOOLS IS SOMETHING THAT I BELIEVE IS BEING DISCUSSED IN IN SUB FOR. AND THAT IS THE- CHANGES TO- BUT- SOME. ADDITIONAL FUNDING THOSE PROVIDED IN THE NINETEEN TWENTY BUDGET. THAT WAS INTENDED TO BE TO PROVIDE LONG RUN- DOWN OF UNFUNDED LIABILITIES UNFUNDED PENSION LIABILITIES FOR SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES- THAT PROPOSAL WHICH WAS GONNA PROVIDE LONG RUN RELIEF- NOT AS MUCH IMMEDIATE BUT- SIGNIFICANT OVER THE LONG RUN. HAS NOW BEEN CHANGED TO- PROVIDE BE USED TO PROVIDE IMMEDIATE. RELIEF AND REDUCING RATES FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES IN. OUR IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO- SO OVERALL THE LONG TERM SAVINGS WILL BE WILL BE SMALLER BUT THEY WILL BE MORE IMMEDIATE. IN IN THE NEXT YEARS. THIS IS ANOTHER IMPORTANT FACTOR THAT'S- AFFECTING KIND OF. SOME COMMENTS ON SOME OF THE- INDIVIDUAL POSSIBLE LET'S SAY NOT FOR THE SPECIFIC ITEMS RIGHT NOW I'M JUST HAPPY TO. ANSWER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU SIR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ANY COMMENT. GOOD MORNING GENERAL ROD AND SENATORS AND THIS IS JESSICA HOLMES FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THE MAY REVISION BALANCES ARE AVAILABLE RESOURCES- AND MAXIMIZES SUPPORT FOR ELEAZAR THIS DIFFICULT TIME. AS MR CABRAL MENTIONS THAT CROP NINETY GUARANTEE HAS BEEN REDUCED DOWN BASED ON CHANGES IN REVENUES. AND WE ARE PROPOSING TO FUND IT AT ITS MINIMUM GUARANTEE LEVEL HOWEVER- WE DO PROPOSE ALSO QUITE A BIT ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO HELP SUPPORT SCHOOL DISTRICTS. DEAL WITH THESE CUTS. WE DO THIS AS MR BALL AGAIN MENTIONED BY PROPOSING TO INCREASE REVENUES AT. ALL FUNDS- MAINTAINING INCREASED SPECIAL EDUCATION FUNDING THAT WE PROPOSED AT A JANUARY- INCREASING THE STIRS PERS PAYDOWN OF EMPLOYER RATES IN. TWENTY TWO AND PROPOSING SEVERAL FLEXIBILITIES FOR LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES ADDITIONALLY BASS WILL TALK ABOUT IN THE LATER ITEM WE ARE PROPOSING TO PROVIDE AND THIRTEEN BILLION DOLLARS TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS OVER SEVERAL YEARS. I'M IN THE FORM OF A ONE TIME OVER PREPARATIONS OF ONE POINT 5% OF ALL GENERAL FUND. THIS TOTAL AMOUNT REPRESENTS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TEST TO- AND TEST ONE THE FUNDED LEVEL IN BOTH TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY AND TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE- AND WE ARE ALSO PROPOSING TO REVENGE TEST ONE OF THE GUARANTEE. UP 240% FROM ITS CURRENT THIRTY EIGHT PERCENT. WE BELIEVE ALL OF THESE PROPOSALS WILL ALLOW SCHOOLS TO. RECOVER FROM THE CURRENT ECONOMIC DOWNTURN MORE QUICKLY THAN THEY OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE WE'RE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE TODAY- I HAVE A TEAM HERE WITH ME. ON SPECIFIC TO PROP NINETY EIGHT MY COLLEAGUE- AND READY WILL BE ANSWERING ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE THANK YOU. THANK YOU THE PURPOSE OF EDUCATION ANY COMMENTS. YES THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN ROCK AND MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE STEPHANIE GRACE AND SHE STUCK THE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION HERE FOR SUPERINTENDENT PUBLIC INSTRUCTION TWENTY THURMAN AND THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. THANK YOU FOR HAVING US HERE TODAY. AS YOU KNOW THE KOBE NINETEEN CRISIS HAS DRAMATICALLY IMPACTED NEARLY EVERY FACET OF LIFE. HM WELL WE APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR'S WORK TO KEEP EDUCATION FUNDING I'M CHANGE DURING THE CURRENT YEAR AS ALLOCATION OF FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION IN FEDERAL FUNDS FOR K. TWELVE WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS ABOUT THE CUTS TO EDUCATION FOR THE BUDGET YEAR. PARTICULARLY BECAUSE SEE THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA THE PROPOSED CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA WOULD BE A SIGNIFICANT CUT AT ANY TIME. BUT THIS IS NOT ANY TIME THE LCF CUTS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED NOT JUST IN RELATION TO THE PREVIOUS YEAR'S FUNDING BUT YOU THE INCREASED COSTS WILL STILL OPERATE IN THE TIME OF COPING NINETEEN. WHEN SCHOOLS REOPENED THEY WILL FACE MANY NEW CHALLENGES SCHOOLS WILL HAVE TO RECONCILE THE PHYSICAL LIMITATIONS OF CLASSROOMS AND SCHOOLS IT SAYS. THAT THE CLOSEST SYNCING REQUIRE. TEACHERS PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOR DISTANCE LEARNING TO DEVELOP- AND READINESS FOR NEW AND CREATIVE APPROACHES TO KEEPING. THESE ARE JUST A FEW SAMPLE STRAIGHT. UNDER AND IT NEEDED TO WE CAN SAFELY OPEN SCHOOL. WHICH WE ALSO IT'S CRUCIAL FOR STATES TO REAL. ECONOMY THIS. SCHOOL REALLY ARE AT THE SAME ARGUE. SCHOOLS FROM A LIST EAR AND CURSED CONNECT. TO A TEACHER OR STAFF MEMBER ACCESS TO INTERNET AND DEVICE. SUPPORTERS EMOTIONAL WELL AND- MEALS FOR MANY OF OUR- TO SCHOOL ARE THE ONLY PLACE THEY FEEL SAFE. AND ARE PROVIDED WITH THE ACADEMIC AND PERSONAL NURTURING THE DESERT. AS YOU KNOW HEALTHY SCHOOL MEALS PROVIDE ESSENTIAL FOOD SECURITY SAFELY THAT SAFETY NET FOR OUR MOST VULNERABLE CHILDREN. RESEARCH CONFIRMS THE LINK BETWEEN WELL NURSE STUDENTS AND ACADEMIC SUCCESS OVER SOME STUDENTS SCHOOL MEALS AND MOST SIGNIFICANT. DAY THROUGHOUT THE PAST TEN WEEKS OUR SCHOOLS HAVE BEEN ON THE FRONT LINE OFFERING CRITICAL MEAL SERVICES. THE CD HAS RIGHT. FOR TWENTY FIVE FEDERAL WAIVERS AND HAS ACCRUED OVER EIGHT HUNDRED AND NINETY LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCY WAIVERS FOR NON CONCRETE MEALS AND MORE I. THINK THREE AND STATES THE COMPANY CONDEMNING BECAUSE ALL EXACERBATED THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. EVEN BEFORE BEFORE THIS. BEGAN SUPERINTENDENT THURMAN. AN INTERESTING THEY GOT IN ACCESS NOW THIS TIME OF DISTANCE AND ARE RELIANCE ON RIGHT AND- THE NEED IS EVEN. SICK SIGNIFICANT IN LATE MARCH THIS YEAR. FORM THE DIGITAL DIVIDE TASK FORCE CO CHAIRED BY SENATOR LEYVA AND WITH LEGISLATORS FROM BOTH HOUSES INCLUDING SENATOR MCGUIRE TO ADDRESS THIS GAP. FOR NOW AND INTO THE FUTURE CALIFORNIA NEEDS AT LEAST FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND LAPTOPS AND THREE HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND WIFI HOT SPOT. TO CONNECT EVERY STUDENT TO THE INTERNET AT HOME. WE NEED TO WORK TOGETHER AND BE CREATIVE WE KNOW THAT THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE EASY BUT WE'RE LOOKING TO THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR TO FIND WAYS TO AVOID CUTS TO EDUCATION FUNDING. AND PROPOSITIONAL REVENUE SOURCES TO ENSURE SCHOOLS HAVE THE FUNDING THEY NEED TO BE SUCCESSFUL OUR TEAM IS HERE TO ANSWER ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH TOM. COLLINS RUN ISSUE NUMBER ONE ANY QUESTIONS MEMBERS FROM THE DIOCESAN LABOR. SEVERAL NO SIR OKAY HEARING THE QUESTIONS LET'S MOVE ON TO- ISSUE NUMBER TWO THIS HAS TO DO WITH THE SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT PLAN AND PROP NINETY EIGHT TO THE EXTENT THAT THAT THIS IS NOT BEEN COVERED LMAO. YES CRAWL DELAY- SIDE I THINK THAT THE- MEETINGS ALL THE TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE PROPOSAL- EARLIER OF THE PROPOSAL IS TO CREATE A SUPPLEMENTAL- PAYMENT PLAN FOR- SCHOOLS BEYOND WHAT'S IN THE PROBLEM AND EVEN I'M GUARANTEED. BEGINNING IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. I'M NOT OBLIGATIONS WOULD BE ONE POINT YEAR- AND OUT WOULD BE IT WOULD ADD UP TO ABOUT THIRTEEN BILLION OVER A MULTI YEAR PERIOD. AND IN ADDITION THE DM TEN YEARS FOR SOME OF WHAT SOME OF THOSE PAYMENTS WILL BE ONE TIME PAYMENTS BUT SOME OF THEM WOULD BE ONGOING PAYMENTS WOULD INCREASE OF NINETY EIGHT OVER THE LONG RUN. I MEAN SPECIFICALLY THE STAR OF GENERAL FUND IS GOING TO SCHOOLS. OR THE SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES IN A MINIMUM GRADE WOULD GO UP FROM 3540% BY TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR. WE CONCERN WITH THE ALTHOUGH WE WRECK YOU REJECT IT. I'M THINK ARE. ARE CONCERNED JUST THAT THE- WHOLE DOES COME. TECHNOLOGY HAND. MOVING FORWARD AND HOW TO MANAGE THE BUDGET PROBLEMS. I'M INDIA. OUR MULTI YEAR OUTLOOK- THE STATE IS FACING DEFICITS WHILE THE SAME TIME MAKING THESE ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS. FROM THE SCHOOLS. AND WE WOULD NOTE THAT- THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE WILL GO UP AS REVENUES INCREASE AND NOTHING CURRENTLY PREVENTS THE LEGISLATURE FROM. PAYMENTS ABOVE THE MINIMUM GUARANTEED TO CHOOSE TO DO SO WE JUST RECOMMEND YOU DO SO. THE WILL TO GIVE YOU MORE. I'M YEAR TO MAKE THE ABOUT HOW MUCH YOU CAN IS OUR- R. COMMITTED TO PROVIDE SCHOOLS ON HOW ONE YEAR BY YEAR BASIS. THANK YOU SIR- RESOLVE THE PERMANENT FINANCE IBM.

WHERE I WOULD JUST- YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY WE KNOW SUPPORT OUR PROPOSAL AND WE FEEL THAT IT PROVIDES A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF UNCERTAINTY FOR SCHOOLS IN THE YEARS COMING OUT OF A TIME WHEN AT THAT WE ALL. UNIFICATION ECONOMIC DOWNTURN FOR THEM AS- IN MANY OF THEM YOU KNOW WE'RE STILL CONTINUING TO MAKE CHANGES AND ADAPTS TO LIFE POST THE LAST RECESSION AND WITH THE ADVENT OF THOSE EFFECTS IT'S INTERESTING SO MANY THINGS HAVE CHANGED OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS- AND SO WE- ARE PROPOSING THIS. AS A WAY TO HELP THEM MAINTAIN RESILIENCY IN THE COMING YEARS AND KIND OF A MIDDLE GROUND WHERE. WE CAN STILL PUT FORTH A TRANSPORT SHIP WHEN IT COMES TO. PARTS OF THE BODY OUTSIDE OF PROP NINE EIGHT BUT WE FELT IT THIS WAY THIS WAS A WAY TO REALLY MAXIMIZE- THAT GROWTH. AND RETURNING THEM BACK TO THE GYM TRAJECTORY- THEY WERE ON BEFORE- CODE NINETEEN SO I'LL LEAVE MY COMMENTS ABOUT BUT HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU SIR DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. ANY COMMENTS.

THANK YOU FOR CALLING SPECTRA DOES ANY QUESTIONS ARE LEVEL YEAH SEVERAL. OKAY THIS IS A HOLD OPEN ITEM SO- WE'LL MOVE ON TO. ISSUE THREE IT'S- ITEM SIXTY ONE HUNDRED DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION ISSUE THREE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA REDUCTIONS AND DEFERRALS. I HAVE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IN THE BATTING CAGE. THIS SPAM UP I CAN'T HEAR YOU. OKAY CAN YOU CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW SENATOR OCT CLEAR AS A BELL THANK YOU. AMBER ALEXANDER WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. TO HELP DISTRICTS MAINTAIN SOME LEVEL OF FISCAL STABILITY DURING THIS ECONOMIC DOWNTURN THE MAY REVISION STRIKES A BALANCE BETWEEN REDUCTIONS IN PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT EXPENDITURES AND APPORTIONMENT DEFERRALS. BUT THE QUICKLY ONE POINT NINE BILLION AND I'LL SEE IF I THOUGHT PORTION WENT FROM ALL THREE POINT FOUR BILLION IS ADDED TO THAT AMOUNT IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE FOR A TOTAL OF FIVE POINT THREE BILLION IN ELSE EFFECT- ALL SCHEDULED FOR PAYMENT ON TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. THE MAYOR VISION ALSO INCLUDES TRAILER THE LANGUAGE TO ESTABLISH A PROCESS FOR LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES TO SEEK AN EXEMPTION IF APPORTIONMENT OF GIRLS IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE WILL CREATE A DOCUMENT OF HARDSHIP. ADDITIONALLY THE MAY REVISION PROPOSES TO REDUCE REDUCE ALSO AFFECT FUNDING BY TEN PERCENT. OR SIX POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THIS PRODUCTION INCLUDES THE ELIMINATION OF A TWO POINT AND MAKING THESE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE ALSO AFFECT THE ADMINISTRATION'S GOAL WAS TO EQUITABLY REDUCED THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING PROVIDED FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS CHARTER SCHOOLS AND COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION. AND I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU MA'AM HELLO. YES I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY MAJOR CONCERNS WITH THE OVERALL STRUCTURE IN TERMS OF THE BALANCE OF DEFERRALS AND REDUCTIONS I THINK WE WERE JUST SO WE JUST HAVE A COUPLE OTHER OPTIONS BESIDES THAT YOU CONSIDER IF YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE OTHER REDUCTIONS OUTSIDE I'LL SEE ABOUT- OR OUTSIDE OF THE BASE OF THE EFFORTS OF PUTTING HIM OUT I'M- WHAT WHAT AREA IS IT RELATED TO THE WHY WOULD THE MINIMUM CITY PROVISION OF LCF. ADD ON TO THE FORMULA THAT WAS PROVIDED- CERTAIN AMOUNT OF FUNDING FOR SOME DISTRICTS ARE MOVING FORWARD- THROUGH MOSTLY. THIS FUNDING SOURCES IT'S GOES TO BE TO GET DISTRICT THE- WHO. PROPERTY TAXES ARE ONE IS. BEYOND OUR BUT WHAT THEY WOULD UNDER I'LL SEE IF I STILL THERE SINCE EVEN EFFECTIVE. LEVEL ARE GREATER THAN I'LL SEE UP. AND IT'S NOT NECESSARILY BASED ON ANY PARTICULAR- DETERMINATION OF NEED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL SO. WE BREAK AMANDA ARE ONE OPTION WOULD BE TO. ELIMINATE THIS PROVISION WHICH WOULD SAVE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION GENERAL FUND. THAT COULD BE USED PRODUCTION ART. AVOID REDUCTIONS IN OTHER AREAS. ANOTHER ANOTHER ALTERNATIVE TO THE LEGISLATURE IF YOU DON'T WANT TO GET RID OF THE THIS PROVISION COMPLETELY SCRAMBLED MY- SPECIFIC. REDUCTIONS TO THE MINIMUM STATE AID OR TO OTHER CATEGORICAL PROGRAMS FOR BASICALLY DISTRICTS WHOSE. ARE WITHIN THE REVENUES PRIMARILY. FROM PROPERTY TAXES. WHEN THE EMBLEM LC CUTS. THE WAY THAT IS IT MAY IS BY. REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF GENERAL FUND OF THE RECEIVES. IF YOU'RE A BASICALLY DISTURBING YOU DON'T GET GENERAL COUNTRY EFFECT AND THERE IS NO REDUCTION FOR YOU. AND SO WHEN WAY TO ONE ONE. OPTION FOR YEARS TO COME- IMPLEMENT LANGUAGE IT SAYS THAT THERE WILL BE REDUCTIONS TO OUR BASICALLY DISTRICTS UP IN PROPORTION TO A 10% CUT TO HEALTHIER PRODUCTS. YOU CAN WOULDN'T WOULDN'T INSURE ALL DISTRICTS ARE FACING THE SAME KIND OF REDUCTION ON THE YEAR OVER YEAR BASIS. BUT ALSO MEANS THAT YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE A CONDITIONAL REDUCTIONS IN OTHER PARTS OF. THE THANK YOU SO-DEPARTMENT WHICH- ANY REMARKS WE ALREADY EXPRESSED OUR CONCERNS AROUND THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA CUTS. THANK YOU. MEMBERS WITH US ANY QUESTIONS SETTLEMENT TOMORROW LET ME ASK YOU ONE OR TWO OF FINANCE MAYBE YOU COULD RESPOND TO THE LA- THIS PROPOSAL- IN PART OF THE PROPOSAL RELATED TO BASIC AID DISTRICTS AND CATEGORICAL FUNDING AND THE OTHER POINTS THAT WERE MADE. WHAT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AS MENTIONED- IN THE IN THE OPENING REMARKS AREN'T CAN'T WHAT'S REALLY TOP 5210% REDUCTION- EQUITABLY ACROSS THE BOARD. SO WE DIDN'T TAKE THE APPROACH OF APPLYING IT AT THE BASE GRANT- WHICH WILL BAN YOU KNOW REDUCED- SUPPLEMENTAL AND CONCENTRATION GRANTS FUNDING AS WELL AS FLOW THROUGH THE FORMULA- OUR INTENT WAS ALSO TO APPLY THAT IN PERCENTAGE. RECENT REDUCTION TO THE- TOP. IN THE FORMULA INCLUDING MINIMUM STATE AID. I'M HOME TO SCHOOL AND BASIC AID AND SO WE'RE HAPPY TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION BUT OUR OUR GOAL I THINK. WHAT'S REALLY IN LINE WITH BRAIN- ACROSS THE BOARD DOWN BY 10% THANK YOU LET ME ASK ONE ONE QUESTION RELATED TO DEFERRALS- I ASK IT BEFORE- SHOULD BELIEVE I DID DURING THE- BIG BUDGET OVERVIEW HEARING- ON THE MAY REVISION BUT- WITH RESPECT TO DEFERRALS. WHAT HAPPENS TO THOSE DISTRICTS THAT HAVE LIMITED. RESERVE ACCOUNTS AND LIMITED ABILITY OR PERHAPS NO ABILITY. TO BORROW AFFECTED FLEET TO COVER OPERATING EXPENSES. IN THE INTERIM. AMBER ALEXANDERAGAIN- WITH FINANCING THERE IS TRIBAL LANGUAGE I'M SPECIFIC TO THE TWENTY TWENTY WONDER CROSS TO PROVIDE AN EXEMPTION FOR LEDS THAT WOULD FIND THEMSELVES. IN THAT CIRCUMSTANCE. THERE IS NOT AN EEMPTION PROCESS FOR NINETEEN TWENTY- BUT BUT OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THAT THAT IS GOING TO BE A JUNE TO JULY DEFERRAL AND SO IT'S REALLY GOING TO BE A MATTER OF- YOU KNOW MAYBE ONLY A SCENE THAT CAME. I'M JUST A MATTER OF WEEKS LATER THAN THEY OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE SO AT THE END. HOPEFULLY THEY'LL BE ABLE TO- TO PLAN AND NOT BE AS IMPACTED BY IT RIGHT AFTER PEARL. GOING FORWARD IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE WE ARE MINDFUL AND THE ONLY ISSUE YOU KNOW MAY HAVE SOME DIFFICULTY AND WANTED TO PROVIDE THAT EXEMPTION PROCESS FOR THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES DO WE HAVE ANY IDEA HOW MANY DISTRICTS WOULD BE. IMPACTED IN THAT WAY. WE'VE HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION- ABOUT ABOUT HOW MANY LEDS TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THAT PROCESS WHEN IT WAS PUT IN PLACE DURING THE LAST RECESSION. I'M IN OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT IS THAT IS THAT AT AT THAT TIME- IT WAS REALLY ONLY A HANDFUL OF ELLIE IS THAT NEEDED THAT EXEMPTION- GRANITE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE VERY DIFFERENT- THAT'S GOING AROUND SO. WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT REALLY IN A POSITION TO SAY YET- YOU KNOW HOW MANY LEDS ARE GOING TO NEED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE RECOGNIZING THAT THESE ARE IMPRESSED AT TIMES THAT WORK IN OURSELVES AND. OKAY WELL. THANK YOU FOR YOUR- THIS ITEM AS WELL AS A HOLD OPEN ITEM LET'S MOVE TO ISSUE NUMBER FOR CATEGORICAL PROGRAM- TRIGGER REDUCTIONS AND LET'S START WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THANK YOU GENERAL THIS IS JUST GOING TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO WE'VE PROPOSED- TO PUT SEVERAL OF THE REDUCTIONS THAT WE SPOKE ABOUT EARLIER I'M INTO WHAT'S CALLED A TRIGGER ALTHOUGH I THINK SOME PEOPLE ARE REFERRING TO IT IT'S REVERSED TRIGGERED BECAUSE THE IDEA BEHIND THIS WOULD BE THAT. TO THE EXTENT THAT REAL FUNDING AND THIS INCREASED FOR EDUCATION- WE WOULD USE THOSE FUNDS THE FIRST CALL THOSE FUNDS WOULD BE AND TO REDUCE THE PRODUCTION IN L. C. S. ARE PROPOSING TO INCLUDE THE REDUCTIONS TO CAP ORACLES- IN THAT. A TRIGGER AS WELL. SPECIFICALLY IN THE CATEGORICAL REDUCTIONS WE'VE PROPOSED 50% CUT. IN MANY OF OUR CATEGORICAL- AND THEN OTHER REDUCTIONS OF DIFFERING LEVELS- IN SOME WHERE YOU KNOW THAT THAT THERE WERE SOME. SITUATIONS WHERE- 50% REDUCTION IS NOT. POSSIBLE FOR EXAMPLE IN THE AFTER SCHOOL GRAMS THAT WE HAVE AND WE REDUCE THIS DOWN TO THE PROPERTY NINE MINIMUM FUNDING LEVELS SH SO- THOSE REDUCTIONS WERE ALL INTENDED TO INSURE THAT WE COULD REDUCE A GENERAL PURPOSE RUNNING THROUGH ALL SEE ABOUT. AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE AND PROVIDE AS MUCH FLEXIBILITY. FOR LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES AS POSSIBLE AND HOW THEY UTILIZE THEIR FUNDS TO ADDRESS REDUCTIONS IN REVENUES DURING THIS DIFFICULT TIME. HAPPY ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE THANK YOU. THANKYOU- DIFFICULT CHOICES HAVING TO BE MADE HERE HELLO. IF I WOULD DECIDE ON THE ON THE CITY PROGRAMS. THERE WILL BE A FURTHER DISCUSSION ON SOME OF OUR COMMITTEE CALLS RELATED PROPOSALS IN EUROPE IN THE NEXT ITEMS IN YOUR AGENDA MY REFLECTION. ON OUR AFTER SCHOOL I WOULD JUST NOT ONE OPTION FOR YOU TO CONSIDER THE WAY THAT THE REDUCTIONS RACES WOULD BE ABOUT A 15% REDUCTION IN THEIR RATES. THE PER CHILD RATES THAT THEY RECEIVED- ONE ONE OPTION IS TO GIVE THEM SOME MORE YOUR PROVIDER SUPPORTS ABILITY TO R. TO RETAKE THE REDUCTIONS BY REDUCING THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN THAT THEY SERVE- AND MAINTAINING THE AMOUNT TO PAY- BASE SPEND PER CHILD THIS WOULD ALLOW WE RECOGNIZE THAT'S OBVIOUSLY A TRADE OPTIONS TO REACH YOUR CHILDREN IT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT. MIGHT BECAUSE IDEAL BUT- OTHERWISE THEY MIGHT HAVE TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS TO THE KINDS OF ACTIVITIES AND PROGRAM OFFERINGS AT THE CALENDAR FOR. BUT I SCHOOL PROGRAMS AND SO. THIS WILL BE RIGHT BACK TO. FOR PROVIDERS MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT WHETHER WOULD PREFER TO HAVE. A EATS SOME BETTER PRODUCE MORE ARE ROBUST PRO. WITH YOU CHILDREN. TO MAKE SOME REDUCTIONS TO THOSE KIND OF ACTIVITIES SO THAT THEY CAN SERVE MORE CHILDREN. OR CONTINUE SERVING THE SAME ON THE SERVER. THANK YOU I LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING SOME FURTHER CONVERSATION ON THE- ON THE CTE PROGRAMS WHEN WE GET TO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE OF SECTION BECAUSE I AS I RECALL. YOU HAVE SOME. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR. VERSUS ONE STRONG WORK FORCE PROGRAM OVER ANOTHER AND I'D BE INTERESTED IN. HAVING SOME FURTHER CONVERSATION ABOUT THAT- THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. THANK YOU TERRORIZE WE UNDERSTAND THESE ARE DIFFICULT CUTS ALL THE WAY AROUND AND DON'T HAVE ANY SPECIFIC COMMENTS AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU. COLLEAGUES FOR LEVEL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR GOOD MORNING EVERYONE YOU KNOW THESE ARE DIFFICULT AND UNPRECEDENTED TIMES BUT I JUST WANT TO GO ON RECORD SAYING THAT I ABSOLUTELY CANNOT SUPPORT A BUDGET THE CUTS A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OUT OF OUR AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAM. WHEN WE THINK ABOUT RE OPENING AND WE'LL TALK MORE ABOUT CHILD CARE AS WE GO THROUGH THE BUDGET. WHEN WE THINK ABOUT RE OPENING OUR ECONOMY. IF PARENTS DO NOT HAVE A PLACE FOR THEIR CHILDREN TO GO. NO ONE GETS OFF WORK AT TWO OR THREE O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON SO OUR OUR AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS. ARE MORE CRITICAL THAN THEY HAVE EVER BEEN IN I APPRECIATE THE LA- SAYING THAT THEIR CHOICE COULD BE TO REDUCE THE DAILY RATE. OR TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN THAT THEY SERVE I DON'T REALLY THINK THAT'S A CHOICE- AND I UNDERSTAND LIKE I SAID THESE ARE DIFFICULT TIMES BUT IF WE'RE TRULY GOING TO REOPEN OUR ECONOMY. AND ALLOW PARENTS ESPECIALLY WORKING MOMS TO GET BACK TO WORK THEY HAVE TO HAVE THESE. AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS AND WE JUST STARTED MAKING SOME PROGRESS WITH OUR AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS AND WE HAD A LOT OF OUR DIFFERENT PROGRAMS. BUT AFTER SCHOOL IS JUST CRITICAL AND ESSENTIAL AND I THINK WE CAN FIND A BETTER WAY. THANK YOU MR CHAIR. THANK YOU SIR LEVINSON MARONEY QUESTIONS. OKAY. ISRAELI CREATED I THINK THIS IS A HOLD OPEN ITEM SO LET'S MOVE ON TO. ISSUE NUMBER FIVE. WHICH IS FEDERAL CORONAVIRUS RELIEF FUNDS.AND THERE IS A STAFF RECOMMENDATION ATTACHED TO THIS SO DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. GOOD MORNING AMBER ALEXANDER WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE ADMINISTRATION. INDICATION INCLUDE A STRONG FOCUS ON EQUITY FOR VULNERABLE STUDENTS LEARNING LOSS MITIGATION IN SUPPORT FOR HELPING SCHOOLS THROUGH THIS ECONOMIC DOWNTURN. TO THIS END THE MAY REVISION PROPOSES A ONE TIME INVESTMENT OF FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION AT TWO LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES TO ADDRESS LEARNING LOSS RELATED TO COVERT NINETEEN SCHOOL CLOSURES. FRIENDS MAY BE USED FOR A VARIETY OF PURPOSES INCLUDING EXTENDING AND BE INSTRUCTIONAL SCHOOL YEAR PROVIDING ADDITIONAL ACADEMIC SERVICES ARE INTEGRATED SUPPORT SERVICES FOR PEOPLE. FOR ACTUALLY DRILLS OR DEVICES FOR BOTH IN CLASSROOM AND DISTANCE LEARNING. ONE AND A HALF BILLION OF THESE FUNDS WILL BE DISTRIBUTED TO L. A.'S BASED ON THEIR SPECIAL EDUCATION ENROLLMENT COUNTS BUT THE REMAINING TWO POINT EIGHT FIVE FIVE BILLION BEING DISTRIBUTED ON A PER PUPIL BASIS TALLY ACE THAT GENERATE CONCENTRATION GRANT FUNDING. THIS METHODOLOGY IS INTENDED TO TARGET FUNDING TOWARDS AT LEAST WITH THE MOST VULNERABLE STUDENTS NAMELY THOSE FOSTER YOU ENGLISH LEARNERS LOW INCOME STUDENTS AND STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES. AS A CONDITION OF RECEIVING THESE DOLLARS ELEAZAR ALSO BE REQUIRED TO COMPLETE AN- INSTRUCTIONAL CONTINUITY PLAN. DESCRIBING HOW THEY WILL USE THE FUNDS IN FULL COMPLIANCE WITH FEDERAL LAW. HOW THEY WILL MEASURE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE SERVICES THAT THEY'RE PROVIDING WITH THESE DOLLARS AND HOW THE L. E. A. WILL ENSURE THAT ALL STUDENTS ARE PROVIDED WITH THE PRICES AND CONNECTIVE ITTY. I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE REGARDING THE PROPOSAL. WELL BEFORE WE GET TO OUR QUESTIONS AND I THINK WE'LL PROBABLY HAVE A COUPLE- LET'S MOVE TO THE LA L. YEAH. I'LL JUST I'LL DESCRIBE THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION HERE FOR YOU THE RECOMMENDATION HERE IT WOULD BE. TO PROVIDE THE SAME LEVEL OF FUNDING TO PROVIDE THE FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IN FEDERAL FUNDING FOR THE LEARNING LOSS MITIGATION ARE. CRAP AND TO. DISTRIBUTE THE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION BASED ON THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES **** IN THE MAY REVISION. I BET THEY'RE CHANGING THE DISTRIBUTION ARM AND THE TECHNICIAN THAT WOULD BE TO DISTRIBUTE THE TWO POINT NINE BILLION. R. TWO R. ELLIE IS IN PROPORTION TO THEIR TOTAL I'LL SEE IF I'VE BEEN DOING AS OPPOSED TO THE INDUSTRY PROPOSAL WHICH ONLY PROVIDED FUNDING FOR THOSE WHO RECEIVE CONCENTRATION GRAB A- THE STAFF OF THE MISSION ALSO ADOPTS A PLEASE LOOK CREDIBLE LANGUAGE OR WHATEVER. WHAT'S THAT'S WHY ALLI IS- CAN ALSO USE THE FUNDS FOR WRAPAROUND SUPPORTS AROUND THE STUDENTS THAT ARE SIMILAR TO THE KIND OF SCHOOL PRIDE IN THE COMMUNITY SCHOOLS MODEL. AND A BIG CAN USE IT TO SUPPLEMENT EXISTING BEFORE AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS- THAT. SHOULD TROUBLE TO MORE AND- BUT WE HELP WITH. LOSS OR OTHER SHE- OKAY THANK YOU DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. IF YOU WERE SUPPORTIVE OF ANY ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FUNDING THAT CAN BE SHIFTED TO EDUCATION. OKAY WELL LET ME- SOME REAL WOULD YOU GIVE ANY QUESTIONS FIRST FOR ME ASK A QUESTION OR TWO THEN. FINE IT'S PERHAPS YOU COULD. SORT OF TELL ME WHAT THE RATIONALE WAS BEFORE SELECTING A CONCENTRATION GRANT. ALLOCATION FORMULA FOR THIS FEDERAL FOR THESE FEDERAL RELIEF FUNDS. WE CERTAINLY RECOGNIZE THAT THERE IS A YOU KNOW A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT WAYS THAT YOU CAN GO ABOUT DISTRIBUTING THESE THESE DOLLARS THE ADMINISTRATION'S GOAL WAS REALLY TO- TARGET THESE FUNDS TOWARDS THE MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS- AND WE FELT LIKE CONCENTRATION GRANT FUNDING BECAUSE IT IS GENERATED- YOU KNOW BASED ON A PERCENTAGE. OF AUSTRIA'S FLOWING AND FOR REALLY WHY I APPROPRIATE MEASURE TO DIRECT FUNDING TOWARDS THAT POPULATIONS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO TARGET. BUT IT DOES YOU WOULD ADMIT THAT IT DOES CREATE A- SYSTEM OF WINNERS AND LOSERS HERE WERE SOME DISTRICTS GET NO MONEY IN OTHER DISTRICTS GET. MONEY CORRECT. THERE CERTAINLY WOULDN'T- THERE CERTAINLY WOULD BE SOME LEDS AND BECAUSE THEY DON'T GENERATE CONCENTRATION GRANT DOLLARS WOULD WOULD BE- ELIGIBLE FOR THIS PRODUCT I'M FINDING THAT AGAIN- THAT THAT WAS INTENTIONAL ON OUR PART BECAUSE WE DIDN'T FEEL- LIKE WE NEEDED TO TARGET THESE FUNDS TOWARDS THOSE. AT LEAST WITH THE HIGHER POPULATIONS. OKAY WELL AS YOU SEE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GET TOGETHER AND WORK ON THIS BECAUSE WE CERTAINLY WANT TO. TAKE CARE OF THOSE WHO WERE ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS FOSTER KIDS FREE AND REDUCED LUNCH THE DISADVANTAGED. STUDENTS FROM DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND ARE. IN EARLY AGE BUT WE ALSO NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S AT THE SAME TIME AN APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF FUNDING. IN ALL DISTRICTS- THAT CROSS THE STATE- AND AS I RECALL. IN THE THIRTY FIRST SENATE DISTRICT FOR EXAMPLE. THIS FUNDING FORMULA LEAVES OUT OF A FORTY OR FIFTY THOUSAND. KIDS AND THAT'S THAT'S A DIFFICULT SITUATION SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO GRAPPLE WITH THAT BUT I DO APPRECIATE THE RESPONSE AND I LOOK FORWARD TO THE CONVERSATION CALLING SERVE ANY. QUESTIONS ON THIS SETTLEMENT OKAY OKAY. WE WILL. TAKE CARE OF THIS WHEN WE GET TO THE- VOTE ITEMS LET'S MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER SIX.

WILL NOT PASS IT ALONG TO MY COLLEAGUE LISA RESEARCH. GOOD MORNING LEAVE THE RESIDENCE THE PARDON OF FINANCIER OF THE ESR FUNDS ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS PROPOSED TO GO TO THE COMMUNITY SCHOOL- GRANT PROGRAM. THIS IS THE SAME PROPOSAL THAT WAS PRESENTED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET HOWEVER INSTEAD OF USING THE THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND WE SHIFTED THEM. THOSE OLD. AS YOUR- WHAT WE CALL THE NINETEEN AND YOU HAVE YOU HAD DISCUSSED BALDWIN AT AN AMBER PRIOR ON THE PANDEMIC HAS ACCESS ACT EXASPERATED CONDITIONS OF POVERTY AND THE IN EQUITIES WHICH LEAD TO OUT BARRIERS TO LEARNING SO THIS FUNDING WILL BE USED TO DEVELOP NETWORKS OF COMMUNITY SCHOOLS IN HIGH POVERTY AREAS TO BETTER COORDINATE HEALTH TO HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES SUPPORT FOR HIGH NEEDS STUDENTS. THE ADMINISTRATION OF THIS GRANT AGAIN WILL BE JUST A- ADMINISTERED BY THE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION. ALL WITH THE APPROVAL AND IN COORDINATION WITH THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION SO WITH THAT WE I WILL OPEN UP IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. I THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION BY THE WAY FINANCE THAT'S ABOUT THE SMOOTHEST BATON PASSING I THINK I'VE EVER SEEN. L. L. AND YOU THOUGHT THIS IS GONNA BE THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION HERE- SO THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION IT WOULD MAINTAIN THERE'S ONE AND A HALF MILLION BITS OF THIS OF THIS FUNDING OF JUST 10% SIX OUT OF A GROUP GOING TO THE DEPARTMENT OF THAT'S PROPOSED TO GO TO THE DEPARTMENT ABOUT FIRST AID OPERATIONS. WITH THAT RECOMMENDATION WOULD MAINTAIN THAT FUNDING BUT THEN THE REMAINING HUNDRED AND SIXTY THREE POINT TWO MILLION WOULD BE USED FOR DIFFERENT PURPOSES SIXTY THREE POINT TWO MILLION WOULD BE USED FOR OUR CHILD NUTRITION REIMBURSEMENT ADMINISTERED TO ALIENS WHO SERVED OR WILL CONTINUE TO SERVE SCHOOL MEALS FROM WHEN KOBE. ARE TO GAP THROUGHOUR BEGINNING OF THE SCHOOL YEAR- THE ACTION BUT ALSO NO KNOW THAT THIS THING IS UP SOME OF THOSE ADDITIONAL FUNDING CAN BE USED FOR PURPOSE- FUNDING WOULD BE USED INSTEAD AND THEN THIS FUNDING WOULD THEN BE REDIRECTED TO THE LEARNING PROCESS. BLACKROCK BUT I DID HEAR HEART BEAT THE- IT INCLUDES SEVEN HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION AND NUTRITION FUNDING. THAT WAS PART OF THE FEDERAL AT IS NOW IN THE MAIN REASON THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AS WELL ZERO GUY AS HOW THAT CAN BE SO IF HAPPENING BE USED THIS PURPOSE WOULD BE A WE USE THE THAT'S I MEAN. I'M NOT CURRENTLY THERE'S A HIGH MILLION FOR SCHOOLS WE OPENING SO WHAT GRANT WHICH ARE GOING TO ALL A OF STUDENT BUT FOR ALL OF THEM WHO ARE NOT WHO HAVE R. OR NON CLASSROOM EXCLUDING AUSTIN BASED CHARTER SCHOOLS AND THIS FUNDING THAT COULD BE USED VERY EFFECTIVELY FOR THINGS LIKE CLEANING SUPPLIES EQUIPMENT SOCIAL. EMOTIONAL SUPPORT FOR STUDENTS WERE INTRIGUED. THANK YOU SIR TO PERPETRATION ANY COMMENT. I YES WE JUST LIKE WHAT WE WOULD LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE'S ABILITY TO PASS THE BATON TO SMOOTHLY WE HOPE AND AIM TO DO THE SAME THING AND WHEN IT IS OUR TURN TO TRANSITION WE UNDERSTAND THE SENATE STAFF RECOMMENDATION IS DIFFERENT THAN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WHICH WAS COMMUNITY SCHOOLS AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT WE PREFER YOU PREVIOUSLY SUPPORTED COMMUNITY SCHOOLS BUT ALSO SUPPORT ADDITIONAL CHILD NUTRITION FUNDS AS WELL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR CALLING A QUESTION CERTAINLY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR IT DOES SEEM LIKE THERE'S SOME CONFUSION AROUND THE CARES MONEY AND HOW IT CAN BE SPENT SO I'M JUST HOPING THERE WILL BE SOME GUIDANCE THERE I KNOW THAT THAT WOULD BE EXTREMELY HELPFUL FOR THE- THAT'S COOL EACH SCHOOL AND THE NUTRITIONIST SO JUST. ADVOCATING FOR SOME GUIDANCE. SEVERAL QUESTIONS YES I DO HAVE PLEASE YEAH I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHAT THE DEPARTMENT CAN SHARE YOUR THINKING ABOUT WHY NON CLASSROOM. BASED SCHOOLS THAT RELY ON SITE BASED RESOURCE CENTERS TO PROVIDE IN PERSON INSTRUCTION- HAS BEEN EXCLUDED FROM THE FEDERAL CARES ACT- SUPPLEMENT FOR LEARNING LOSS PLEASE. ANYBODY. WELL SIR I THINK EARLIER WAS SIMPLY PRESENTING THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION- HELLO DO YOU HAVE ANY INSIGHT. I WOULD I THINK- BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE INTENT IS IN PART BECAUSE IF THESE ARE PHYSICALLY RE OPENING- IF YOU'RE PHYSICALLY OPENING SCHOOL SITES AND SOME OF THE COSTS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THAT AND THAT'S WHY THE- FUNDS RECORDED BUT I. RECOGNIZING SEVERAL I DO BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE SOME. OF MY CLASSROOM BASED PROGRAM TO HAVE SOME. ON WHAT SOME PEOPLE ARE NOT THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY FULLY ONLINE AN THERE ARE- OR FULLY AT HOME AND THERE ARE A LOT ABOUT PROGRAMS THAT DO OCCUR ON C. SIX SCHOOLS ARE. MAYBE WE NEED TO TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT THAT I MEAN I'VE IF YOU LOOK AT THE DESCRIPTION IT'S PRIMARILY DESIGNED TO HELP THE SCHOOL. RE OPEN PRESUMABLY A SCHOOLTHAT'S GOING TO TAKE STUDENTS ON SITE CLEANING SUPPLIES EQUIPMENT TRAINING. IN TERMS OF HOW TO DO THAT RE OPENING BUT PERHAPS. PERHAPS THERE IS SOME ASPECT HAVING TO DO WITH THESE. NON CLASSROOM BASED CHARTER SCHOOLS WE CAN TAKE A LOOK AT IT AND WE'LL BE HAPPY TO DO THAT. YOU CAN. THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS COLLEAGUES LET'S MOVE ON TO. ANOTHER DIFFICULT ISSUE ISSUE SEVEN CALCULATING ADA AND INSTRUCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS. FOR TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION ON THIS IS A HOLD OPEN ITEM BUT- LET'S GO AHEAD AND START WITH THE ELIO. THE SERVICE IS NOT AN ISSUE THAT'S SPECIFIC TO YOU YEAH THAT'S INCLUDED IN THE MAIN REASON BUT I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT ISSUE FOR YOU ALL TO CONSIDER AND DISCUSS AND I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT. WE READ SOME COMMENTS IN A PREVIOUS SUBCOMMITTEE HEARING AND I THINK MANY OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE RAISING THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE I'M NOT. SURE R. ONE HOUSE SCHOOLS ARE FUNDED. YOU WILL SEE IF FOR SPECIAL ED. OR OTHER MAJOR PROGRAMS WITHIN. THE COMING BUDGET YEAR AND THEN WHAT ARE THE- CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS. IN THE EVENT OF SCHOOL CLOSURES. AND JUST PROVIDE SOME BRIEF CONTEXT- WHEN- THE EMERGENCY EXECUTIVE ORDER WAS. WAS ISSUED IN IN MID MARCH- THE LEGISLATURE SUBSEQUENTLY PASSED SB ONE SEVENTEEN. WHICH ARE. TRYING TO PROVIDE SOME OF THE SCHOOL OF STABILITY FISCAL OUR- PREDICTABILITY FOR DISTRICTS IN AND THEN. A COUPLE OF THINGS ONE IT SAID THAT. IF SCHOOL DISTRICTS DO NOT OFFER A FULL HUNDRED NEEDY SCHOOL YEAR. THEY WILL NOT FACE FISCAL PENALTIES WHICH ARE CURRENTLY IN LAW. IF YOU DON'T HAVE A HUNDRED IT'S CLEAR TYPICALLY WE HAVE YOU'RE- YOU'RE ALL SET. I MEAN GETS REDUCED. THE SECOND THING IT DIDN'T. IS IT STOPPED. TURNING EIGHTY EIGHT OR TEN MINUTES- AFTER FEBRUARY TWENTY NINE. AND I. THINK AGAIN THE IDEA WAS. SO THAT SCHOOLS WOULD NOT BE HURT BY THE FACT THAT. MANY STUDENTS WERE COMING ACROSS SO THAT THE RECORD YOUR DRINK- SERVE AS- AS THE- CULMINATING OUTBREAK. AND SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE STATE. SO THAT. THESE ARE THESE ARE MEASURES THAT WERE. INCLUDED FOR THE- OF THE FISCAL YEAR BUT THEY DO. CONTINUE INTO THE YEAR TWENTY FOUR ONE AND SO WANT TO PUT QUESTION TO. WHAT WHAT IF ANY KIND OF MEASURES THIS DO YOU TO INCLUDE IN YOUR TWENTIES. ONE BUDGET CONSIDERING THAT THERE ARE NO RIGHT NOW WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF CLARITY ABOUT EXACTLY WHAT WE OPNING WILL LOOK LIKE. WE DON'T KNOW IF THAT IF SCHOOL OPEN AS THEY- ARE INTENDED BEFORE AND WE DON'T KNOW IF THERE MIGHT BE A POSSIBILITY OF. ADDITIONAL SCHOOL CLOSURES AS- ADDITIONAL OUTBREAKS FLARE UP. OVER THE NEXT COMING YEAR- SO THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF WAYS TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES BUT IT IS AN IMPORTANT QUESTION FOR- SENDING SIGNALS TO. THE FUEL ABOUT. HOW IT WILL BE FUNDED. I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT ISSUE NOT JUST BECAUSE OF THE FISCAL STABILITY BUT ALSO BECAUSE IT FROM FROM. YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY HERE TO SOMETHING QUITE A MESSAGE JUST SCHOOL DISTRICT ABOUT WHAT YOU EXPECT THEM TO DO. DURING THESE CLOSURES AND WHAT KINDS OF. DISTANCE LEARNING SHOULD BE. PUT IN PLACE. IF THE IF ADDITIONAL CALLS WERE TO OCCUR. ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WHEN THIS OCCURRED IS THAT EVERYTHING HAPPENED VERY QUICKLY IN MARCH THAT THE ROAD RIGHT THERE'S A LOT OF GUIDANCE PROVIDED BY THE DEPARTMENT ADDED THERE WAS THAT. EXACTLY WERE SPECIFIED THAT. ARE YOU KNOW- ELLIE'S WORK TO THE BEST OF THEIR ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE. HIGH QUALITY INSTRUCTION THROUGH A DISTANCE LEARNING FORMAT. BUT THIRD BUT BEYOND THOSE KIND OF STATEMENTS THERE WAS NOT A LOT OF CONCRETE. REQUIREMENTS OR EXPECTATIONS AND SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT- AS PART OF THE BUDGET PROCESS YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO WEIGH IN A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THAT. WHAT YOU THINK. FOR EXAMPLE NO NEXT QUESTION. SHOULD BE FOR SCHOOLS. THANK YOU SIR. FINANCE GIVEN THE SICK OF THE BUT ISSUE WERE ACTUALLY A BE INTERESTED IN YOUR COMMENTS. CERTAINLY THANK YOU VERY MUCH- GENERAL OFFICE SO I JUST CALLED DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WE DON'T HAVE A FORMAL POSITION ON THIS PROPOSAL AND AT THIS TIME HOWEVER WE DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS WITH THE IDEA OF. HOLDING HARMLESS EIGHTY A. M. IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE SO THE FIRST THING THAT I WOULD NOTE IS- MOST SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE GOING TO RECEIVE A VERY SIMILAR AMOUNT OF FUNDING PLUS THE PRODUCTIONS AND I'LL SEE ABOUT- AS THEY DID LAST YEAR BECAUSE WE DO HAVE A HOLD HARMLESS ALREADY BUILT INTO I'LL SEE ABOUT THAT ALLOWS THEM TO RECEIVE- THE SAME EIGHTY EIGHT. IN THE PRIOR YEAR AND BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HOLD HARMLESS NINETEEN TWENTY- THAT WOULD NOT NECESSARILY REFLECT ON COULD% NINETEEN AT CHANGES IN DNA. I'M SO THAT'S ALREADY BUILT IN- AND I THINK TO THE EXTENT YOU KNOW THERE'S A CONCERN ABOUT HOLDING PEOPLE HOMELESS IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO I THINK THAT THAT'S DEFINITELY. A CONVERSATION WE CAN HAVE- IN TERMS OF- OTHER CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE WITH WITHHOLDING HARMLESS IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AND WE'VE HAD SOME UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF HOLDING HER LIST IN NINETEEN TWENTY AND AGAIN YOU KNOW WE MADE THAT DECISION AND- THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE LEGISLATURE. IN A TIME OF IT EVEN MORE CERTAIN THAN WE HAVE NOW- IN TERMS OF WHAT'S HAPPENING IN COOK AT NINETEEN AND I THINK AT THE TIME IT WAS CERTAINLY AND I THINK IT REMAINS THE CORRECT THING TO DO BUT WE ARE HAVING SOME UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF THAT- INCLUDING THINGS LIKE WE HAVE. AN OUTSTANDING ISSUE THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF ED ON ESPECIALLY XFINITY ON THE EIGHTH INNING. I WE HAVE SOME LEDS THAT DID HAVE INCREASED YEAH THE BRIDGE WE KNOW CUT OFF TO. ON AND HAD KNOW K. OF YOU KNOW. AM I TO WRITE TWENTY THE STADIUM AND THEN YOU KNOW WE TO SORT OF DOUBLE COUNTING. AND DOUBLE PAY FOR I'LL SEE IF THAT. WAS NOT LONGER AND LONGER. I NEED TO CREATE A CLICK A FACT WHEN YOU WERE FIRST BACK TO AN EDA FUNDING FORMULA- THAT COULDN'T REALLY BE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE SCHOOL INTO SCHOOL DISTRICTS. AND COUNTY OFFICES EDUCATION CHARTER SCHOOLS WHEN THEY REVERT TO. A NORMAL EDA SO- THESE ARE JUST SOME THINGS TO KEEP IN MIND- AGAIN I THINK. WE ARE WE- THINK OF THIS MORE AS A TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO CONVERSATION AS OPPOSED TO TWENTY TWENTY ONE CONVERSATION. THANKS AND THAT'S BECAUSE THERE'S ALWAYS ALREADY A WHOLE WHOLE DORM WAS BUILT INTO THE LC HAVE. YES THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. YES THANK YOU WE I WE NEED TO BE PREPARED FOR THE IMPACT THAT THIS IT INTENDED TO INSTRUCTIONAL TIME IS GOING TO HAVE IN THE COMING YEAR MANY OF OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND ELEAZAR ARE ALREADY PLANNING FOR WHAT THEIR INSTRUCTIONAL MODELS WILL LOOK LIKE THEY'RE SERVING THEIR FAMILIES OUR COMMUNITY NEEDS AND IN ORDER TO HAVE FLEXIBILITY TO ENSURE THAT THEIR INSTRUCTIONAL MODEL WILL MEET THE NEEDS OF THEIR STUDENTS AND FAMILIES THEY WILL NEED THE FLEXIBILITY FOR ADA AND INSTRUCTIONAL MINUTES SO HOLDING HARMLESS THIS YEAR IS WONDERFUL. WE'D ALSO LIKE TO LOOK TO SEE AND EARS AND GOING FROM THE ENROLLMENT EIGHTY SYSTEM AND REALLY REALLY LOOKING AT THE INSTRUCTIONAL MINUTES REQUIREMENT AS WELL WE ARE IN THE YEAR TWENTY TWENTY MOVING INTO TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT OUR EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM. REPRESENTS FACTS AND REPRESENTS THE DIFFERENT INSTRUCTIONAL MODELS THAT OUR STUDENTS WILL NEED TO BE SUCCESSFUL. WELL LET ME START OFF THE QUESTIONS HERE WHAT WHAT WOULD BE THE WHAT WOULD BE THE NEGATIVES ASSOCIATED WITH. HOLD HARMLESS IN THE IN THE IN THE BUDGET YEAR WE'RE DEALING WITH NOW BUILT INTO THE L. C. F. F. AND IF THAT NEEDS TO BE ENHANCED ENHANCE IT. AND THEN. TAKING A LOOK AT. TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. AT SOME LATER DATE WHAT'S THE NEGATIVE TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS. I GUESS THIS GOES TO THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. DID THAT MAKE SENSE. HELLO CAN YOU CLARIFY YOUR QUESTION BECAUSE WE'RE TRYING TO LOOK TO SEE IF THAT'S MORE OF A DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND M. SERVICES THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION VERY INTERESTED IN THE FINANCE POSITION THERE'S A THERE'S A HOLD HARMLESS BUILT INTO THE LC A FAITHFUL TO THE BOOK WHICH WILL TAKE CARE OF AT LEAST LARGELY TAKE CARE OF THE CURRENT OF THE BUDGET YOU'RE WORKING ON NOW. AND WHEN YOU TALK TO TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWENTY TWO. FINANCE IS CONCERNED ABOUT GOING OUT THAT FAR FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS THAT FINANCE LISTED. INCLUDING THE CLIFF EFFECT AT SOME POINT WHEN YOU HAVE TO TREAT THIS THING UP. SO WHAT WHAT WHAT WOULD BE THE DOWNSIDE TO DISTRICTS. TO THINK ABOUT. THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWENTY TWO BUDGET WHEN WE GET TO THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET. SO MANY HAND THIS OVER TO ELIZABETH YOUR SIGN DIRECTOR OF OUR SCHOOL FISCAL SERVICE'S DECISION DIVISION. THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD BATON PASSED. HE TERRORS HEALTH. THANK YOU SENATOR ROCK I THINK- DISTRICTS ARE PLANNING ON A MULTI YEAR BASIS AND SO WHEN THEY DON'T HAVE THAT WHEN THERE'S THAT UNCERTAINTY WHAT WHAT TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO LOOKS LIKE IT JUST IT MAKES THAT MULTI YEAR PLANNING MORE DIFFICULT. HI WELL WE MAY NEED YOU TO GET WITH FINANCE AND TALK ABOUT THIS CLIFF EFFECT AND HOW WE CAN MITIGATE THAT- AS WE MOVE FORWARD ALEX QUESTION CERTAINLY WILL. SEVERAL QUESTIONS WHILE YOU GUYS RIGHT. OKAY THIS IS A HOLDOVER I FIND HIM SO LET'S MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER EIGHT SPECIAL EDUCATION. THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. GOOD MORNING AGAIN LEAVES RESIDENTS GAVE WITH THE- HARTMAN OF FINANCE IRAN I'M SO SORRY SO SORRY THERE'S SOMETHING- SOONER THAN THE REVISION MAINTAINS THE ADMINISTRATION'S COMMITMENT TO INCREASING SPECIAL EDUCATION RESOURCES AND ALSO IMPROVING- SPECIAL EDUCATION FUNDING AND PROGRAMS WITHIN THE WITH THE GOAL OF REALLY IMPROVING THE OUTCOMES FOR STUDENTS WITH THE MOST EXCEPTIONAL NEEDS. AS PROPOSED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THIS PROPOSAL INCLUDES A NEW BASE FORMULA WHICH WOULD INCREASE THE SPECIAL EDUCATION BASED WORKPLACE RIGHTS R. TWO SIX HUNDRED FORTY FIVE MILLION PER ADA THIS IS DOWN SLIGHTLY FROM THE SIX SIXTY PROPOSED AT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AS A RESULT OF. REDUCING OR REMOVING THEM BUT ABOUT YOUR COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT. INCREASING THE BASIC FORMULA IS REALLY IN RECOGNITION OF THE FACT THAT SPECIAL EDUCATION STUDENT IDENTIFICATION AND ALSO THE COST ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING THE FEDERALLY MANDATED SERVICES FOR THOSE STUDENTS HAS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY OVER THE YEARS. AT THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL ALSO MAINTAINS THE WORKGROUPS AND STUDIES INCLUDED IN GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. WHICH BEGAN THE STATE'S PROCESS OF TRYING TO GATHER DATA AND INFORMATION ON OUR SPECIAL EDUCATION STUDENTS AND THE SERVICES THEY'RE RECEIVING. TO BETTER INFORM THE NEXT PHASES OF OUR- SPECIAL EDUCATION REFORM BOTH IN FOR THE FOR MY AND ALSO FOR PROGRAMMATIC REFORMS. ON THESE REFORMS WILL REALLY FOCUS ON EQUITY AND IMPROVEMENT IN THE CURRENT SPECIAL EDUCATION ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM. SO THE MAY REVISION- MAINTAIN THE WORK GROUPS BUT ALSO ADDED A TWO ADDITIONAL WORKERS ONE IS FOR AN IEP TEMPLATE ADDENDUM WHICH WILL FOCUS N ESTABLISHING IN THE- US- DISTANCE LEARNING SPECIAL EDUCATION SERVICE MODEL. LL WHITE PIECE SO THAT SHOULD THIS. HOPEFULLY NEVER AGAIN BUT SHOULD IT HAPPEN AGAIN I'M ALL STUDENTS HAVE A SERVICE PLAN IN PLACE WHICH DOES PARENTS HAVE SEEN AN AGREED TO AND IT SHOULD. BE A LOT BE GOOD FOR BOTH PARENTS AND THE STUDENTS AND THE OTHER IS THAT ADAM WORKGROUP STUDY ON OUR OUT OF HOME CARE I'M AS YOU KNOW AFTER THE CONTINUUM OF CARE REFORM OUR OUT OF HOME CARE FUNDING HAS KIND OF BEEN FROZEN AND ALSO WE REALLY NEED TO GET IN THERE TAKE A BETTER LOOK AT HESE PROGRAMS THE SERVICES AND ALSO- ALL OF THE SERVICES PROVIDED STUDENTS THAT RECEIVE THE OUT OF HOME PLACEMENT. SO WITH THAT I WELCOME ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU FOR THAT HELLO. IF THERE'S ANOTHER ISSUE WHERE THERE'S A STAFF RECOMMENDATION HERE- AND SO I WAS JUST GONNA WALK WALK THROUGH WITH THAT RECOMMENDATION IS BECAUSE THE MULTIPLE COMPONENTS HERE- SO THIS IS AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE ARMY REVISION PROPOSAL- INSTEAD OF PROVIDING. THE SIX HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE MILLION IN ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR B. SPECIAL EDUCATION RATE INCREASES IT WOULD PROVIDE FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE MILLION. THE GRAVEYARD THE ADDITIONAL HUNDRED MILLION THAT'S FREE UP AND WOULD BE USED TO AUGMENT FUNDING FR. STUDENTS WITH LOW INCIDENCE DISABILITIES THESE ARE- THE DEGREE OF STUDENTS WHO HAVE VISUAL HEARING OR ORTHOPEDIC IMPAIRMENTS. ON THE NEXT- PART OF THE RECOMMENDATION IS TO. CONTINUE TO PROVIDE FIFTY MILLION FOR THE GOLDEN STATE THE MAIN REASON PROVIDES FIFTY MILLION FOR THE GOLDEN STATE TEACHER PROGRAM THIS WOULD STILL PROVIDE IT BUT IT WOULD SHIFT FUNDING TO- DEPARTMENT STATE OPERATIONS- AND THEN THERE WOULD BE- EIGHT POINT SIX MILLION IN ONE TIME FUNDING TO ASSIST. IN PROVIDING OUR REGIONAL ALTERNATE ALTERNATE DISPUTE RESOLUTION SERVICES JOBS ARE HIGHER THAN WHAT'S INCLUDED THE MIRROR- THE- B. R. ONE ADDITIONAL THING THAT INTEGRATIVE LANGUAGE CHANGES HERE- THE THEY WOULD HAVE TO ADOPT A MARRIAGE PROPOSAL THE SACRAMENT RECOGNITION WENT TO SHIFT FUNDING FROM THE GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY STUDY. AND TO WORK GROUPS- FOR ACCOUNTABILITY IN SPECIAL ED- DELIVERY OUTCOMES THOSE WOULD BE- MOVES FROM ABOUT NINETY TWO FEDERAL ID A FINES AS WAS IN THE MIRROR VERSION- AND THAT WOULD BE ADDITIONAL PLACEHOLDER TRAINER BILL LANGUAGE TO AMEND- TO BROADEN THE SCOPE OF THE GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY STUDY- AND TO INCLUDE THE DEVELOPMENT OF DISTANCE LEARNING. I EAT PEAS ARE YOU GET DONE BUTTONS IN THE RECORDS RELATED. TO DEVELOPING A STANDARDIZED AP TEMPLATE. IN THE FINALLY RATHER HAVING A- OR ON ON HOW TO HOME CARE. THE WEST AFRICAN NATION WHERE. ADOPTABLE GONNA REPORTING WHICH TO DO OUR OUR TO THE A- FOR THAT PROGRAM. THANK YOU SIR THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. THANK YOU WE APPRECIATE THE SIGNAL TO CONTINUE THE WORK ON REFORMING SPECIAL EDUCATION WE SUPPORT THE SIX HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ALLOCATION TO SPECIALIZE IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AND UNLIKE THE SENATE PROPOSAL TO RETAIN THE CURRENT pFORMULA UNTIL REFORMS AND RESEARCH IS FINALIZED WE WOULD APPRECIATE A COLLABORATIVE APPROACH AND BE INVOLVED IN ANY CONVERSATIONS MOVING FORWARD THANK YOU. FOR YOUR COMMENTS VERY VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE AND APPRECIATE THE ATTENTION THAT- FOLKS HEARD A DEVOTING TO A- SIR LEAVE ANY QUESTIONS. THAT I HAVE NONE SO WELL LET'S MOVE ON- THIS MOVE WILL REVISIT THIS ISSUE AGAIN A LITTLE BIT LATER. THE NEXT ISSUED DEPARTMENT- THAT SIXTY ONE HUNDRED APPROACH OF EDUCATION AND FIFTY ONE EIGHTY DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES ISSUE NUMBER NINE. CHARTER RATE REDUCTIONS AND GROWTH ADJUSTMENTS DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH JUST COMPOUNDS DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO THE REVISION INCLUDES SOME REDUCTIONS TO RAPE OR CHILD CARE PROVIDERS AND LIKE TO NOTE THAT- THIS WAS DONE WITH CAREFUL CONSIDERATION AND NOT TAKEN LIGHTLY- BEFORE ANY. ON GOING REDUCTIONS WERE MADE TO RATES- FINANCE LOOK VERY CLOSELY AT ANY UNENCUMBERED- OR UNUSED ONE TIME FUNDS THAT COULD BE REDUCED FROM THESE PROGRAMS ARE SET TO MITIGATE ANY IMPACTS. ON THESE RATE REDUCTIONS- TO ENSURE THAT WE WERE IMPACTING PROVIDERS AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE SH I'M IN THE AREA OF RACE AND OTHER THE OTHER THE OTHER. LENS WE WERE LOOKING AT THIS THROUGH WAS- FOCUSING ON MAINTAINING AS MANY SPOTS AS POSSIBLE GIVEN THE IMPORTANCE OF CHILD CARE AND HELPING. THE ECONOMY RECOVER- THE RATE REDUCTIONS THAT WE DID TAKE WERE EVER AT ELIMINATION OF A 1% OUT ON TO THE STATE PRESCHOOL FULL DAY- REIMBURSEMENT RATE AND 10% REDUCTION TO THE STANDARD REIMBURSEMENT RATE. AND THE REGIONAL MARKET REIMBURSEMENT RATE. FROM RECOGNIZED THAT THESE RATES WILL BE DIFFICULT FOR PROVIDERS TO ACCEPT- HOWEVER WE DO YOU PROPOSE TO MITIGATE THESE IN SOME. WAY BY ALLOCATING SOME FEDERAL CARES ACT FUNDS FOR ONE TIME STATEMENTS TO HELP. PROVIDERS ADDRESS SOME OF THE COST OF CODE NINETEEN ON AND SOME OF THE- COST OF SMALLER. GROUP SIZES THAT MAYBE REQUIRED CONNECTING TEAM WHICH I'M HAPPY TO ENGAGE IN A DISCUSSION- OVER THINKING ABOUT ALL OF THIS- END UP PLEASE LET US KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS HAPPY TO ANSWER THEM. WELL AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME I'D I WOULD APPRECIATE THE FINANCE REACTION TO THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION ONCE IT'S DESCRIBED HERE HAVING TO DO WITH THE ZERO TO FOUR POPULATION TO TRY TO. TAKE CARE OF RATHER THAN HAVE AN AUTOMATIC REDUCTION TO TRY TO TAKE CARE OF THE ELIGIBLE POPULATION AS BEST WE CAN BUT LET'S MOVE TO THE LA NEXT. DISTRO JUST A COUPLE COMING THAT WE HAD A FEW SUGGESTIONS REGARDING ALTERNATIVES TO- TO RATE REDUCTIONS- FOR ALTERNATE WAYS TO TAKE THE REDUCTIONS SPECIFICALLY ON THE REGIONAL MARKET RATE REDUCTION- WE WOULD RECOMMEND RATHER THAN ACROSS THE BOARD REDUCTION THAT THERE BE A REDUCTION THAT'S BASED ON THE REGIONAL MARKET RATE SURVEY. TO ENSURE THAT FAMILIES HAVE ACCESS TO THE SAME- FIRST QUESTION OF THE MARKET IN THEIR AREAS ACROSS THE STATE. THE WAY THAT IT SHOULD MATTER NOW WE HAVE CONCERNS THAT IT MIGHT BUT NOW THAT MIGHT NOT BE THE CASE. WE ALSO NOTED A COUPLE OF OTHER PLACES IN THE CITY WAS INTERESTED IN. MAKING REDUCTIONS OUTSIDE OF. SPECIFIC RATES- OR SLOTS AMERICA A COUPLE OF AREAS CONSIDER. ONE REBOUND BUT THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER REDUCTIONS AGAIN. ADMINISTRATORS ARE ACTIVITIES ARE. ALSO ESTIMATE AGENCIES- OR REDUCTIONS TO THEIR COURT HEARING IMPROVEMENT SYSTEM THAT'S FUNDED THROUGH COMPANY AID- THE OTHER DAY WE WERE NO IS. THERE IS FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN. SIXTY FOUR PENDING THAT IS SCHEDULED TO. IT HAS. TO BE BEGINNING IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO BE USED FOR ADDITIONAL GENERAL CHOCOLATE SAUCE. WELL THERE'S A LOT THAT HAD NOT BEEN ALLOCATED YET NOBODY HAS BEEN AWARDED THOSE FUNDS. AND SO ONE OPTION WOULD BE TO REDIRECT HAPPENING RATHER THAN GOING OUT TWO SPOTS TO BE USED. TO MINIMIZE THE RATE REDUCTIONS THAT ARE. I'M OLDER SPECIFIC COMMON ABOUT I WOULD. TO DIE TALKING ABOUT THE STOPPER. WHICH IS. MORE BODIES OUT NOT ABOUT THE BIGGER PROPOSALS BUT ABOUT THE CHOKER OUR GROWTH ADJUSTMENT WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT'S IN STATUTE. SO UNDER CURRENT LAW- THUS THE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM THE ALTERNATE PAYMENT PROGRAM JOHN TUCKER THEY ARE. ADJUSTED EVERY YEAR BASED ON. DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION ON THE YOU'RE YOU'RE CHANGING THE ZERO FOUR POPULATION- RECENTLY BECAUSE THOSE ARE THE FOCUS HAS BEEN DECLINING THAT HAS BEEN A NEGATIVE ADJUSTMENT- AND IN THIS- IN THIS BUDGET THERE IS A REDUCTION OF ABOUT SIXTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS WHEN YOU ADD EVERYTHING UP. AND THERE'S A TWO POINT 55% REDUCTION IN THE SORT OF CORPORATION PROJECTED SO THAT'S WHERE IT COMES FROM. THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION HERE WOULD BE TO REJECT THAT ADJUSTMENT- IT SO TO. NOT MAKE THE REDUCTION AND THEN TO CHANGE TRAINABLE CHANGE LANGUAGE SO THAT- IN YEARS WHEN THERE IS A NEGATIVE- A REDUCTION IN POPULATION ARE OBSERVABLE. PUBLISHING BUT THERE'S NO JUST. IT WILL PROBABLY GO TO THE OF EDUCATION WELL IT'S STILL FOR FINANCE. YOU COMMENT ON A COUPLE THE POINTS MADE BY ELIO INCLUDING THE REGIONAL MARKET RATE FOR USE OF THE- FAR MORE IN THE REDUCTIONS IN THE LAND OF FIFTY- THAT HE WAS FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR EXAMPLE THAT WAS REFERENCED. CERTAINLY JUST GO HOME DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. SO WE ARE CURRENTLY ARE OUR STAFF ARE CURRENTLY WORKING WITH ELIA STAFF TO ENSURE THAT. THE PRODUCTION TAKE INTO THE ARM R. MAKES THE MOST SENSE IS DONE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. AFTER ACTIVELY WORKING. WITH ELIAN STAFF. STILL PRODUCING. AT ACHIEVING THE SAME AMOUNT OF SAVINGS BUT THAT'S BEING DONE- AS EQUITABLY AS POSSIBLE SO THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE ARE VERY MUCH OPEN TO AND WORKING ON RIGHT NOW SH REGARDING THE FUNDING I BELIEVE THE THIRTY NINE YOU REFER TO AS THE PROP SIXTY FOUR FUNDS. WE HAVE CONCERNS- REGARDING WHETHER OR NOT GREAT CHILD CARE RATES AND BACK FILL WOULD BE- AN ALLOWABLE USE OF PRODUCTS SIXTY FOUR FUNDS- THE LANGUAGE IN PROP SIXTY FOUR REQUIRED. THE FUNDS BE USED TO- HELP. MITIGATE THE IMPACTS ON OTHER CANNABIS SED ON USE- IN TERMS OF OPENING UP NEW SLOTS- AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR STUDENTS OR CHILDREN- TO BE REMOVED FROM SITUATIONS WHERE- THEY MIGHT. BEGIN AND DRUG ABUSE- WE THINK THAT THAT IS ALLOWABLE IT GETS A LITTLE BIT GRAYER WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT- GREAT AXLES FOR CHILD CARE PROVIDERS SO- WE HAVE SOME CONCERNS AROUND THAT- REGARDS TO THE- THE- CHILD A CHILD CARE AND PRESCHOOL. ADJUSTMENT FOR THIS CHANGE ZERO TO FOUR LESION. FOR US THAT IS A TECHNICAL ADJUSTMENTS THAT WE MAKE IT THE STATUTORY ADJUSTMENT THAT WE MAKE- AND AS MR CABRAL NOTED IT HAS BEEN. MORE NEGATIVE IN RECENT YEARS AND REFLECTION OF DECLINING BIRTHRATE. THROUGHOUT THE STATE. WE DON'T HAVE A FORMAL POSITION ON THAT AT THIS POINT HOW WE WOULD THAT THAT WOULD CREATE A REDUCTION IN THE AMOUNT OF PROP NINETY EIGHT AND NINE NINETY EIGHT RESOURCES AVAILABLE FOR OTHER- PRIORITIES. IN THE OVERALL LARGER BUDGET PICTURE. OKAY OUR DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION THANK YOU. I HOPE I CAN HEAR YOU. BUT YOU'RE IN POSITION. SORRY YOUR HONOR OKAY- GOOD AFTERNOON OR GOOD MORNING STILL MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS ARE NOT- MORGAN DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT ON BEHALF OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION JENNY GARMENTS SO IN TOTAL THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISE PROPOSE IS THREE POINT SIX BILLION UP FOR EARLY LEARNING CARE PROGRAMS THAT ARE CURRENTLY ADMINISTERED BY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WHICH IS A THREE HUNDRED AND TWELVE MILLION R. FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO MILLION OR 13% DECREASE FROM. TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY. WE ARE GREATLY CONCERNED BY THE CASTRO SYSTEM ESPECIALLY THE THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY MILLION IN SAVINGS IDENTIFIED WITH THAT TEN PERCENT. AS RATE CUT FOR SUBSIDIZED EARLY LEARNING CARE PROVIDERS GIVEN THE INTEGRAL ROLE WE KNOW QUALITY EARLY LEARNING CARE LADIES. AND BEST SUPPORTING A STRONG ECONOMY. AND EARLY LEARNING CARE REALLY PROVIDES THE ESSENTIAL CHILDCARE TO WORKING FAMILIES AND IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT FOR DEVELOPMENTAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR CALIFORNIA'S CHILDREN. ADDRESSING SCHOOL READY MASS ESPECIALLY FOR ITS MOST VULNERABLE CHILDREN. WELL WE UNDERSTAND THE FISCAL SITUATION THE STATE FINDS ITSELF AND WE ARE CONCERNED THAT THE PROPOSED RATE KIND. RUNS COUNTER TO THE SHARED GOALS OF THE SUPERINTENDENT THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE LEGISLATURE HAVE. OF SUPPORTING ACCESS TO CARE. AT SHORING UP HER BY ALL TO ENSURE THAT THE STATE'S CHILD CARE SYSTEM SURVIVES THIS CRISIS. OUR PROGRAMS WERE ALREADY STRUGGLING WITH RATES THAT BARELY ALLOWED THEM TO STAY AFLOAT. FOR EXAMPLE WITH THE GAC GOVERNORS JANUARY BUDGET RATE PROPOSAL FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM THE RATES WERE FOUR THOUSAND LESS PER YEAR. THAN WHAT THEY STATE CURRENTLY PAYS FOR A VOUCHER CENTER BASED. PART RESPOND TO MARKET RATE SURVEY MANY PROVIDERS HAVE CHOSEN NOT TO APPLY FOR THE PRESCHOOL EXPANSION FINDS. IT NEEDS LOW RATES AND IN AN INABILITY TO SECURE BOTH SPACE AND PAY FOR THEIR TEACHERS AFTER A GREAT. ADDITIONALLY DUE TO CODE IN NINETEEN LIKE HOUSE DIRECTOR ARE REDUCING CHILD CARE CAPACITY SO IT'S ACTUALLY COSTING MORE FAR PROGRAM STOP RATE RIGHT NOW. WE'VE HEARD THAT IT WILL COST THEM ABOUT. ELEVEN THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED CLASSROOM IN CO BUT IT JUST NOT COST. RELATED TO HEALTH AND STATE SANITATION AS WELL AS THE REDUCED GROUP SIZES AND ADDITIONAL STAFFING FOR CHILDREN. R. ONE RURAL COUNTY THEY GAVE US THE COST OF A MILLION THE 10% CUT. WOULD COST THE SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND AND CLEAN ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY THOUSAND TO ABOUT A MILLION DOLLARS. IN ADDITIONAL FUNDS WOULD BE NEEDED THAT WOULD BE LOST. THE PROPOSED 10% CUT WILL PROVIDE CATASTROPHIC TO THE FIELD AND MY RESULT IN MANY PROVIDERS GOING OUT OF BUSINESS. BASICALLY CRITICAL IASI ATHLETE IN LAS CAPACITY THAT IS ESSENTIAL FOR A STRONG ECONOMIC RECOVERY AS CALIFORNIANS HAD BACK TO WORK AND WE NEED TO KICKSTART. VERSUS RESPECT CONNIE. WE ARE CONCERNED THAT THE PROPOSED MECHANISM OF THE RATE CUTS WILL CREATE INEQUITIES AND HELP FAMILIES ACCESS CHILD CARE PROVIDERS THREE BATTERS ACROSS THE STATE. AN IMPACT FAMILIES LIVING IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE STATE DIFFERENTLY CURRENTLY ALL FAMILIES HAVE ACCESS TO AT LEAST 75% OF THEIR PROVIDERS IN THEIR AREA. HOWEVER AS A RESULT OF THIS PROPOSED RATE CAT FAMILIES IN SOME PART OF THE STATE WOULD BE ONLY ABLE TO ACCESS 42% OF THEIR LOCAL CHILD CARE PROVIDERS WITH THE FASTER RATE. ONE FAMILIES IN OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE WOULD BE ABLE TO CONTINUE ACCESSING ARTS ACTUALLY INCREASE TAXES. ARE A FASTER RATE. WE APPRECIATE THE SENATE HOLDING THIS ISSUE OPEN AT THIS TIME AND ARE HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE THE ADMINISTRATION. AND THE LA- TO HELP IDENTIFY ALTERNATIVE COST SAVINGS TO THE SYSTEM SO THAT THESE DRAMATIC CUTS CAN BE AVOIDED CALIFORNIA RECEIVED NO ADDITIONAL FEDERAL ID. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION- OF. CALLING THE QUESTION SIR LEVEL. THANK YOU MR CHAIR. FIRST I'D LIKE TO JUST- I'D LIKE TO THINK THE GOVERNOR AND HIS STAFF FOR WHAT I THINK IT'S BEEN A REALLY PHENOMENAL JOB DURING THIS VERY DIFFICULT TIME- LEADERSHIP REALLY SHINES THROUGH WHEN YOU'RE FCED WITH A CRISIS AND I THINK THAT OUR GOVERNOR HAS LET US VERY WELL. HOWEVER I DO HAVE SOME DEEP CONCERNS ABOUT THE 10% CUT. TO HEALTH CARE WORKERS. THERE IS A SAYING THAT SAYS DON'T TELL ME WHAT YOUR PRIORITIES ARE SHOW ME WHERE YOU SPEND YOUR MONEY AND I'LL TELL YOU WHERE YOUR PRIORITIES LIE. BY CUTTING OUR CHILD CARE PROVIDERS BY 10% IT SHOWS THAT WE'RE NOT PRIORITIZING WORKING WOMEN CHILDREN. OR THEIR FAMILIES AND AS I STATED ABOUT AFTER SCHOOL CARE I WILL STATE ABOUT OUR CHILD CARE PROVIDERS. THERE'S NO WAY THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY CAN GET GOING WITHOUT OUR OUR CHILD CARE FACILITIES UP AND RUNNING. NO ONE GOES INTO CHILD CARE BECAUSE THEY WANT TO MAKE MONEY ARE THEY WANT TO GET RICH THEY DO IT BECAUSE THEY LOVE CHILDREN THEY LOVE OUR CHILDREN WHILE WE'RE AT WORK. THESE ARE SOME OF THE LOWEST WAGE WORKERS WHO HAVE DONE A PHENOMENAL JOB THEMSELVES BUT TRYING TO STAY OPEN AND SERVE OUR FIRST RESPONDERS SO THAT THEY CAN WORK AND TAKE CARE OF ALL OF US. AND AS I SAID ALREADY THE ECONOMY DOES NOT RE OPEN WITHOUT THESE WOMEN WHO ARE DOING THIS JOB. SO I ALSO CANNOT SUPPORT A BUDGET THAT SUPPORTS A 10% CUT TO CHILD CARE SERVICES I KNOW WE CAN FIND ANOTHER WAY I KNOW WE CAN FIND A BETTER WAY AND I KNOW THAT WE CAN DO BETTER BY OUR WORKING WOMEN AND THEIR FAMILIES. SO IS THE CHAIR OF THE LEGISLATIVE WOMEN'S CAUCUS AS A MOM AND AS A GRANDMA WHO HAS A DAUGHTER A CHILD A GRANDDAUGHTER IN CHILD CARE I CANNOT SUPPORT A BUDGET WITH THAT CAT. HOWEVER THAT SAID I HAVE A QUESTION NOT JUST A STATEMENT I'M NOT SURE WHO THIS IS FOR BUT THIS IS REGARDING THE HOLD HARMLESS PROVISION. IF WE'RE GOING TO HOLD HARMLESS THE FUNDING MY QUESTION IS MOST DAY CARES HAVE. THEIR NUMBER OF STUDENTS OUR CHILDREN HAVE BEEN REDUCED SO IF I HAD EIGHTEEN STUDENTS AND I'VE ONLY HAD THREE. WELL MY FUNDING B. FOR THE EIGHTEEN STUDENTS I USED TO HAVE. FOR THE THREE I HAVE NOW I WOULD ADVOCATE FOR THE EIGHTEEN BECAUSE WE WANT THAT DAY CARE CENTER TO STAY OPEN AND GET BACK TO THOSE EIGHTEEN STUDENTS. OKAY OKAY I'M BEING TOLD THAT MIGHT BE A QUESTION FOR THE NEXT ITEM SO I'LL LIST HOLD A QUESTION OVER THANK YOU MR CHAIR. CALGARY FOR THE QUESTIONS IN A ROW. YOU'RE GOOD. OKAY LET'S MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER TEN FEDERAL CARES ACT CHILD CARE FUNDING. THE FINANCE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS JESSICA HOLMES DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- AS ALLUDED TO PREVIOUSLY THE MAY REVISION INCLUDES A PROPOSAL TO ALLOCATE THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS IN FEDERAL KERR SACKED UNDOING ON THROUGH THE CHILD CARE DEVELOPMENT BLOCK GRANT. FOR CHILD CARE- SPECIFICALLY OUR PROPOSAL INCLUDES A HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR POINT THREE MILLION- TO REIMBURSE THE STATE FOR TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY CO THAT NINETEEN REAL EXPENSES. ON THESE INCLUDED FIFTY MILLION PROVIDED FOR TEMPORARY VOUCHERS FOR EMERGENCY WORKERS FIFTY MILLION PROVIDED. FOR CLEANING SUPPLIES AND SANITATION ON FOR CHILD CARE PROVIDERS ANOTHER FORTY FOUR POINT THREE MILLION FOR A VARIETY OF COSTS INCLUDING HOLDING HARMLESS VOUCHER BASED PROVIDERS FOR THIRTY ADDITIONAL DAYS. AND DURING CLOSURE AND- RESCINDING FAMILIES TEENS FOR THE REST OF. I'M SORRY FOR A PERIOD OF SIXTY DAYS. WE ARE PROPOSING- AN EIGHT MILLION DOLLAR ICREASE TO FURTHER RECENTLY USED IN THE REMAINDER OF THE TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY FISCAL YEAR SEVENTY THREE MILLION TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF FRACTURE. DECREASED NUMBER OF DOCTORS AVAILABLE TO FAMILIES- SPECIFICALLY THOSE WHO HAVE OUR ADDRESS CHILDREN AND OUR EMERGENCY WORKERS AND HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION PER STIPENDS FOR CHILDCARE AND PRESCHOOL PROVIDERS I'M SPECIFICALLY TO HELP THEM ADDRESS COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH. I'M CO THAT NINETEEN- AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL ATTENTION REDUCTIONS I'M RELATED TO RATE DECREASES OR- REDUCTIONS THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN ABLE TO STIR. I THINK CRITICIZED. HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE. WELL JUST TO CLEAR UP THE ONE ISSUE I GUESS YOUR LAST STATEMENT THAN WITH ADDRESS THE QUESTION OF SENATOR LEYVA HAVING TO DO WITH. REDUCTIONS IN NUMBERS OF PARTICIPANTS IN THE IMPACT ON. FINANCIAL VIABILITY OF SOME OF THESE CHILDCARE FACILITIES I BELIEVE AND I DON'T WANT TO I DON'T WANT TO MISS CHARACTERIZED- THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION- HOWEVER I BELIEVE THAT AND SENATOR LEYVA IS REFERRING TO HOLDING- TITLE FIVE PROVIDERS HARMLESS FOR CHANGES IN GROUP SIZE REQUIREMENTS WHICH IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING- HOWEVER. OURS ARE MORE ONE TIME IN NATURE I BELIEVE SINCERELY THAT WAS REFERRING TO SOMETHING THAT'S A LITTLE MORE ON CALLING. MAYBE YOU COULD BE MORE SPECIFIC ON THE ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE MILLION FOR STIPENDS FOR CHILDCARE. THIS IS THIS BECAUSE YOU DID IS THIS MONEY BEING PROVIDED BECAUSE OF REDUCED SIZE OF PROGRAMS. THE STIPENDS WOULD BE PROVIDED- TO REFLECT A VARIETY OF ADDITIONAL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING CARE DURING THE NINETEEN. SO THIS COULD BE THE ONGOING COSTS OF CLEANING AND SANITIZING- THE END THE INCREASED REQUIREMENTS- FOR. SMALLER GROUP SIZES- AND A VARIETY OF OTHER CHANGES THAT PROVIDERS ARE HAVING TO MAKE IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE CARE DURING THE ACADEMIC. OKAY WHEN WE GO AHEAD LET'S CENTER LEVELS KERR I ASSUME IT'S A FOLLOW UP QUICKLY AS WE MOVE ON THANK YOU MR CHAIR SO- AND YOU ARE CORRECT MY QUESTION IS ABOUT THE TITLE FIVE PROVIDERS IT WHEN I SEE SERVING THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF CHILDREN. MY CONCERN IS JUST LIKE I SAID IF YOU HAD EIGHTEEN BUT ONLY HAD THREE NOW BUT YOU CAN STILL YOU CAN STILL GET BACK TO EIGHTEEN START CHILDREN WHO WOULD WANT THAT TO HAPPEN. I MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE STIPEND MONEY THE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION- DOESN'T NECESSARY THEY'RE KIND OF TWO DIFFERENT THINGS SO I'M JUST LOOKING FOR SOME GUIDANCE ON HOW DO WE KEEP THAT CHILD CARE CENTER OPEN WHO CLEARLY ISN'T MAKING ANY MONEY BUT HAS STAYED OPEN. AND I DON'T KNOW IF I MAKING MYSELF CLEAR BUT CAN BE IF IT'S A HOLD HARMLESS PROVISION CAN THEY STILL BE REIMBURSED THE HEIGHT THERE THERE ARE A NUMBER OF CHILDREN THEY HAD I GUESS MAYBE THAT'S WHAT I'M ASKING. THANK YOU SO MUCH AND- I DON'T AND I DON'T NECESSARILY WANT TO MISSPEAK. ABOUT THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION HOWEVER I WOULD NOTE THAT CURRENTLY TITLE FIVE PROVIDERS. AS A CONDITION OF THEIR CONTRACT HAVE BEEN HELD LARGELY HOLD HARMLESS- DURING THE CURRENT VIRUS PANDEMIC- AND I. I ASSUME THAT THIS THIS HOLD HARMLESS WOULD WOULD ACT SIMILARLY AND I WOULD TURN. OVER THE QUESTION TO YOU. I'M CERTAIN OF A WORKING AT THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO MAYBE DESCRIBE A LITTLE BIT BETTER WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE WHOLE TOTAL FIVE. PROVIDERS HARMLESS AND THROUGH THEIR CONTRACTS. THAT WOULD BE GREAT BECAUSE MAYBE I'M NOT COMPLETELY UNDERSTANDING IT EITHER. OKAY WELL BEFORE WE DO THAT LET'S GO TO THE L. L. AND THEN MOVED TO THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION HELLO. MR SAW ALL THIS CRAP TO STOP RECOMMENDATION I CAN. TALK A LITTLE ABOUT THE EARLIER WITH CONCERNS BUT I THINK. THE DEPARTMENT MIGHT HAVE SOME MORE SPECIFICS ON ON ALL THE PROGRAMS WORK WITH BUT- THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION WOULD BE TO ADOPT. THE MAIN REASON PROPOSALS TO PROVIDE THE HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR POINT THREE MILLION FOR. COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE CURRENT YEAR. AND THEN AT SEVENTY THREE MILLION TO INCREASE OUR TEMPORARY EMERGENCY VOUCHERS FOR AT RISK CHILDREN OR CHILDREN ESSENTIAL WORKERS. AND THEN ALSO DEVELOPED VERY NINE DOLLARS TO EXTEND FAMILIES HE REVERSED UNTIL JUNE THIRTIETH. I'M FROM THERE IN TERMS OF AREAS WHERE MOST AFRICAN NATION WOULD WOULD VARY FROM THE MAIN REVISION. ONE IS THAT THERE WOULD BE AN EXTENSION FOR THE EXPENDITURE OF FIFTY MILLION RESPECTIVELY PROVIDED IN THE CURRENT- THAT'S PART OF THE TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR. NINETY TWENTY COSTS FIFTY MILLION WAS FOR EMERGENCY ROGERS- THIS WOULD. ALLOW THAT FUNDING TO CONTINUE TO BE USED- TO ALLOW EXTENDED TO. IT WHICH WOULD BE BIG NEWS BROKE THREE TWENTY ONE- THE NEXT THING THAT THE RECOMMENDATION WOULD DO WOULD BE TO ADOPT A DISCERNIBLE LANGUAGE TO PROVIDE A HOLD HARMLESS THE TITLE. PROVIDERS FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE FISCAL YEAR I THAT. YOU KNOW IS THE ARE. AVAILABLE TO SCAN THE MAP NUMBER OF CHILDREN UNDER WHATEVER THE RISKS ARE. BECAUSE OUR TIME. THE CLOTHES YOU YOU ARE. STRAP I'M- SORRY THAT I BELIEVE THAT THE OLDER THIS IS BASED ON NINE TWENTY CONTRACT AMOUNTS MEANS. IF YOU'RE A YOUR CONTRACTOR MAY TWENTY WERE SERVING NEEDS YOU A COUNTRY FREE T. AND WHAT THE TIME WE WITH BEFORE THANK YOU THAT VERY. A MAN IN THE FINAL OF THE STUFF WOULD BE- IS A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE MILLION FOR STATINS ARE STILL BE THE SAME AMOUNT EXCEPT THE STATE AND WOULD BE PROVIDED IT WOULD NOT BE PROVIDED FOR THE DIRECT CONTRIBUTORS AND THEY ARE RECEIVING A HOLD HARMLESS AND INSTEAD IT WOULD GO TOWARD. TEACHER I'M OTHER LICENSED PROVIDERS BUT ALSO- WHAT'S DIFFERENT FROM THE MAY REVISION AS IT WOULD ALSO BE A FOUR ACCOUNT WORKS IS WHEN PROVIDERS. AND FOR MY SCRIPT WRITERS. PERFECT THE PURPOSE. ANY COMMENT. YES PLEASE ASK THEIR NUMBER MORGAN HERE AT DEFEAT SUPERINTENDENT ON BEHALF OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION TO MEET THEIR MATCH RACE WE REALLY WANT TO THANK THE LEGISLATURE AND ADMINISTRATION FOR THEIR PARTNERSHIP SO FAR AND HELPING US TO ADDRESS THE CODE NINETEEN ISSUES AS THEY ARISE. WE APPRECIATE THE IDENTIFICATION OF RESOURCES THROUGHOUT THIS EMERGENCY THAT ALLOWED US TO PROVIDE EMERGENCY CHILDCARE CENTER WORKERS AND VULNERABLE POPULATIONS SUPPLIES TO PROVIDERS AND PRODUCTION FOR PROVIDER PAYMENT WE ALSO APPRECIATE THE INCLUSION OF EIGHT MILLION AND THEN BE REVISED AWAY FAMILY FEES THROUGH JUNE THIRTIETH. TWENTY TWENTY AS WE KNOW OUR FAMILIES ARE STRUGGLING. WE ALSO APPRECIATE THE SENATE'S. THAT MORE RESOURCES ARE NECESSARY INTO THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE FISCAL YEAR TO STABILIZE CALIFORNIA'S EARLY LEARNING AND CARE PROVIDERS. AND ARE HAPPY TO SHARE ANY SPECIFIC DETAILS THAT MAY BE HELPFUL WITH. SH AS I SAID EARLIER WE RECOGNIZE THAT ALL OF OUR PROGRAMS THAT ARE OPEN DURING KOBE NINETY. HAVING CREASED COST AND FINANCIAL BURDEN REALLY OR WITH EQUITY WE WOULD WANT THE A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE PROVIDER SOLVENCY FINDS TO BE AVAILABLE TO ANY OF OUR SUBSIDIZES INSTEAD OF AN OPEN. WHETHER THEY ARE PROVIDING EARLY LEARNING CARE ST DIRECT CONTRACTS OR THROUGHOUT YOUR- IN RESPONSE TO SENATOR LEVI'S HOLD HER LAST WHAT WE'VE HEARD FROM OUR PROGRAM IS THAT. IN THE BEGINNING LAST FAMILIES WERE COMING TAKE CARE AND AS SOME OF THE FAMILIES WERE SHELTERING IN PLACE AND MAKING OTHER. CERTAIN SITUATIONS WORK RIGHT NOW MORE AND MORE OF THEM ARE COMING BACK TO CARE INCOMING AND WHAT WE'VE DONE CURRENTLY S. HOLDER PROVIDE OUR PROVIDERS ARE LESS. REGARDLESS OF THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN ATTENDING AS LONG AS THEY WERE INVOICE SCENE ASKED FOR THE CURRENT COST KEEPING OUR STAFF EMPLOYED AND ENGAGE WITH THEM OR HELP HER LAST. MOVIE FORWARD IT WOULD BE SOMETHING SIMILAR AND ADDRESSING THE FACT THAT WE WOULD WANT OUR STAFF STILL RETAINS EVEN IF A GROUP SIZE OR RATIO HAD TO DECREASE SHE SAID THEY WERE LESS CHILDREN ENGAGE THERE WOULD STILL BE THE SAME NUMBER STAFF THAT WOULD BE NEEDED. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY OTHER ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS THE COLLEGE QUESTIONS EARLIER. I JUST WANNA SAY THANK YOU THAT WAS VERY HELPFUL. THE MAROON THE QUESTIONS. OKAY RIGHT NOW CONCLUDES PART EIGHT OF OUR GENDER IF YOU WILL GIVE US- FIVE TO TEN MINUTES WE'RE GOING TO SHIFT TO PART B. AND MOVE THROUGH- THAT PORTION OF THE AGENDA AND THEN MOVE INTO PUBLIC COMMENTS. WITH THE PARTY OF THE AGENDA BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE A NUMBER ONE IN EDUCATION THE ITEM IS SIXTY EIGHT SEVENTY CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES THE ISSUE IS ISSUE NUMBER SEVENTY SIX. STUDENT CENTERED FUNDING FORMULA APPORTIONMENT ENROLLMENT GROWTH AND DEFERRALS. DO WE HAVE. THE REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO ADDRESS ISSUE NUMBER SEVENTY SIX. GOOD TO HEAR GOOD MORNING STILL. GOOD MORNING LAST AFTERNOON- SENATOR RAWSON AND MEMBERS MICHELLE NEW IN WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- I'LL FIRST PROVIDE A HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW OF THE PROPOSALS INCLUDED AT THE MERRY VISION FOR HIGHER EDUCATION. SO DESPITE THE HIGH HEALTH AND ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF THE COVE IN NINETEEN PANDEMIC. SAID MINISTRATION REMAINS COMMITTED TO MAXIMIZING ACCESS AND EQUITY. THE ADMINISTRATION ASKED THAT THE STATE COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES DO ALL THEY CAN TO SUPPORT CALIFORNIA AND ITS STUDENTS DURING THIS DIFFICULT TIME AND EXPECT THAT THESE REDUCTIONS IN FUNDING WILL NOT HAVE A DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT. ON LOW INCOME UNDERREPRESENTED OR DISADVANTAGED STUDENTS. TO ENSURE THAT HIGHER EDUCATION REMAINS AN OPTION FOR STUDENTS REGARDLESS OF THEIR ECONOMIC STATUS. THEY MINISTRATION HAS PROPOSED TO ENSURE THAT CAL GRANT AND MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAMS REMAIN UNTOUCHED FOR ALL STUDENTS WHO ARE CURRENTLY ATTENDING OR PLANNING TO ATTEND. ONE OF CALIFORNIA'S INSTITUTIONS OF PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION. ADDITIONALLY THE ADMINISTRATION WOULD LIKE TO SEE COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES CONTINUE TO WORK TOWARDS. PROVIDING FULLY ONLINE EDUCATION OPTIONS WITH AN EMPHASIS ON ENSURING THAT UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENT GROUPS ARE ABLE TO ENROLL AND SUCCEED IN THESE PROGRAMS IMPORTANT UNFORTUNATELY AND IN RESPONSE TO. THE CLEANING ECONOMIC CIRCUMSTANCES THE STATE HAS TAKEN SIGNIFICANT STEPS TO ENSURE A BALANCED BUDGET INCLUDING WITHDRAWING MOST OF THE SPENDING PROPOSAL. PRESENTED AT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AND MAKING SIGNIFICANT FURTHER REDUCTIONS. FOR SOME OF THESE PROPOSALS WE HAVE INCLUDED LANGUAGE THAT WOULD RESTORE THE PROPOSED REDUCTIONS IF SUFFICIENT NEW FEDERAL FUNDING FOR PROVIDED TO THE STATE. AND WITHOUT- I'LL SPEAK TO THE STUDENT CENTERED FUNDING FORMULA APPORTIONMENT AND DEFERRALS. SO AS YOU KNOW DUE TO A SIGNIFICANT. DROP IN THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE THE MAY REVISION PROPOSES A BALANCE OF REDUCTIONS IN DEFERRALS- IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES BUDGET MOST NOTABLY A REDUCTION TO THE STUDENT CENTERED FUNDING FORMULA TEN PERCENT. WHICH WHEN COMBINED WITH THE FOREGONE COLA THAT WAS WITHDRAWN FROM THE MIX FROM THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET TOTALED ROUGHLY SEVEN HUNDRED AND SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS. IN ADDITION THE MAY REVISION PROPOSED A TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE FOR AN APPORTIONMENT DEFERRAL OF THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY POINT ONE MILLION FROM CURRENT YEAR TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY. YOUR BUDGET HERE TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AND A DEFERRAL OF SIX HUNDRED AND SIXTY TWO POINT ONE MILLION FROM BUDGET YEAR TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR. TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. WE WOULD NOTE THAT CURRENT LAW HAS A HARDSHIP EXEMPTION FOR PERSIMMONS DEFERRALS AND MARY VISION PROPOSES A TECHNICAL AMENDMENT. FOR THAT HARDSHIP EXEMPTION TO BE MADE APPLICABLE TO THE PROPOSED DEFERRALS AND TRAILER BILL. IN ADDITION TO YOU- TO THE DEFERRAL TRAILER BILL THE MAYOR REVISION PROPOSES. ADDITIONAL TRAILER BILL THAT MAKES CHANGES TO THE STUDENT CENTER POINT FUNDING FORMULA INCLUDING CLARIFYING. TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY RATES PURSUANT TO THE TWENTY NINETEEN BUDGET ACT. EXPANDING THE HOLD HARMLESS PROVISION FOR THE FUNDING FORMULA BY TWO YEARS. TO TWENTY TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR. PROVIDING FLEXIBILITY FOR DISTRICT SEES PRIOR YEAR DATA WHEN CALCULATING THEIR TWENTY TWENTY ONE CUNNING FORMULA ALLOCATION. AND REQUIRING THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE TO MAKE A PORTION MEANT REDUCTIONS FOR NON BASIC AID DISTRICTS AND CATEGORICAL REDUCTIONS FOR BASIC IN DISTRICTS. AND WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION HELLO. THANK YOU CHARAKTER HOLSTEIN HOUSE AND WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. SO THERE ARE SEVERAL PROPOSALS BEFORE YOU IN THIS AGENDA ITEM ARE YOU JUST HEARD FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ABOUT THE APARTMENTS A PORTION OF IT WHICH IS WITHDRAWN. THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY PROPOSAL ON COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT. FUNDING AS WELL AS ENROLLMENT GROWS MOST NOTABLE REALLY AND- MAY REVISION IS A FACE CUTS TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE APPORTIONMENT OF FIVE HUNDRED NINETY THREE MILLION DOLLARS- WHICH IS WHICH REPRESENTS AN EIGHT PERCENT. DISCOUNT TO COLLEGE'S CORE OPERATING FUNDS. IF THE COMMITTEE WANTED TO EXPLORE ALTERNATIVES. TO MAKING JUSTIN UNALLOCATED BASE CUT WE HAVE SHARED SOME OPTIONS WITH STAFF AND THESE ALTERNATIVE REDUCTIONS REALLY SEEK TO TARGET REDUCTIONS TO NON CORE LOWER PRIORITY PROGRAMS WITHIN THE COLLEGES. IN ADDITION TO THE APPORTIONMENT CUTS ON THE MAY REVISION PROPOSES A DEFERRAL- DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE MENTIONED SIX HUNDRED AND SIXTY TWO MILLION DOLLAR A DEFERRAL AND PAYMENTS TO DISTRICTS TO FUTURE YEARS. THAT'S PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S CITATION ALL- SOLUTION. NOW AS OF JUST A FEW DAYS AGO YOU SHOULD KNOW THE ADMINISTRATION HAD NOT YET SPECIFIED WHEN COLLEGES WOULD RECEIVE THIS DEFERRED- PAYMENT- AND SO- I MEAN COLLEGES RECEIVE PAYMENTS A MONTH OR TWO OR LATER. SAY IN JULY OF TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE. THE PROPOSED DEFERRALS LIKELY WOULDN'T WOULD BE MANAGEABLE BY MOST IF NOT ALL DISTRICTS AND AS YOU JUST HEARD THE MAY REVISION DOES INCLUDE SOME HARDSHIP LANGUAGE. FOR FOUR DISTRICTS. SO DEFERRALS A CHIEF ONE TIME GENERAL FUND SAVINGS- WITHOUT GENERALLY AFFECTING THE AMOUNT OF PROGRAM THAT THE COLLEGES HAD TO- TO SPEND ON SO- DEFERRALS ARE- A VIABLE BUDGET OPTION FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER OUT WE DO NOTES AGAIN THOUGH THE LEGISLATURE STILL NEEDS DETAIL ON WHEN THESE PAYMENT. DEFERRALS WOULD ACTUALLY BE MADE DISTRICTS BECAUSE THAT THAT'S PRETTY IMPORTANT FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO BETTER IDEA HOW MANAGEABLE JACKLEY THESE- THIS PROPOSAL IS FOR WORK FOR THESE COLLEGES. THANK YOU. JUST TO CLARIFY- IN TERMS OF YOUR APPEAL TURNER'S. THOSE ARE THE ALTERNATIVES HAVING TO DO WITH THE- COLLEGE PROMISE PROGRAM THE INTERCOLLEGIATE ATHLETICS CALIBRATE. BUT ON AN ONGOING BASIS AND THEN SOME ONE TIME SOLUTIONS PROPOSED AGAIN CALIBRATE SOME LOTTERY FUND- RESTRICTION ELIMINATIONS AND OTHER ITEMS. THAT'S CORRECT SO IT'S A MIX OF I'M GOING. OF THE DENTAL SOLUTIONS AS WELL AS SOME ONE TIME ACTIONS THAT COULD HELP THE COLLEGES GET THROUGH THE BUDGET YEAR AND HAVE MORE TIME TO PLAN FOR THE FOLLOWING YEAR. THAT PROCEDURE COMMENTS- I BELIEVE WE HAVE A REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. MORNING AFTERNOON BY NOW. SENATOR ROSS LISETTE NEVER AT MY STUDENTS FOR COLLEGE FINANCE AND FACILITIES PLANNING WITH THE COVERAGE MANY COLLEGES. ARE WE RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS A VERY TOUGH BUDGET FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER BUT BEFORE WE PROVIDER OVERALL REACTIONS WANTED TO JUST SHARE. THE IMPORTANT ROLE THAT CALIFORNIA'S ME COLLEGES THAT PLAYED ON AND THE COMPANY NINETEEN RESPONSE- AND THEN REMIND THE STATE ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE THAT WE CAN ALSO PLAY IN THE RECOVERY- FOR REEMPLOYMENT OF CALIFORNIANS AND THE OVERALL ECONOMY. I'M AS YOU KNOW TEN YEARS AGO THANKS TO THE CALIFORNIA COLLEGES TRANSLATED DIRECTLY INTO IT IT TO OUR WORK FORCE AND FURTHER WHITE IN CALIFORNIA. DEGREE GAP THE GREATEST RISKS THAT WE NOW SEE IN THIS PROPOSED BUDGET ARE THE NEGATIVE IMPACTS TOWARDS PROGRESS TOWARDS EQUITABLE SUCCESS AND THE EFFORT THAT WE'VE MADE AROUND THAT IT. WEIGHS UP COMPLETION. AND I DON'T NEED TO REMINDALL OF YOU THAT CALIFORNIA COLLEGES ARE THE LOWEST FUNDED SYSTEM OF EDUCATION YET THE MOST CONSEQUENTIAL FOR EQUITY ACCESS. WE ARE CONCERNED THAT WITH THESE PROPOSED. CUTS WE WILL SOON REACH A BREAKING POINT. THE PROPOSED CUTS PROVIDE A ONE FIVE BILLION DOLLAR DIFFERENCE COMPARED TO WHAT WE SAW IN THE JANUARY PROPOSAL THAT FOR COMPARISON IT IS EQUIVALENT TO THE SAME LEVEL OF CUTS WE SAW IN THE FIVE YEARS OF THE GREAT RECESSION ALL OCCURRING IN ONE YEAR THIS REDUCES OUR CORPORATE STUDENT LOAN FUNDING LEVEL BY 13% COMPARED. WE COMPARE ALL OF THE CUTS AND THEN IT ALSO RAISE THEIR WORK FORCE PROGRAMS OUR WORKFORCE PROGRAMS AS YOU MAY KNOW- PROVIDE TRAINING AND EDUCATION FOR TWENTY THOUSAND FIRST RESPONDERS ANNUALLY- AND THOSE WILL BE ESSENTIAL IF WE ARE TO RECOVER. AND CONTINUE SERVING CALIFORNIANS IN THIS TIME. PHYSICALLY TO THE PROPOSALS IN THE MAY REVISION WE DO THINK THAT THERE ARE SOME ELEMENTS THAT ARE WORTH NOTING IN THEIR POSITIVES. WE THANK THE GOVERNOR FOR AGAIN THE EMPHASIS ON COMPETENCY BASED EDUCATION AND EXPEDITED EFFORTS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF SHORT TERM CAREER EDUCATION PROGRAMS. WE APPRECIATE THE FLEXIBILITY ARE RELATED TO COPE WITH NINETEEN COSTS FROM THE 50% MARK- AND NOT- INSURING THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO FURTHER PENALIZED LIMITED FRIEND FUNDS FROM COLLEGES. WE SUPPORT- OUR EFFORTS TO MINIMIZE THE EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS FOR COLLEGES SO THAT AGAIN WE ARE NOT SENDING LIMITED RESOURCES AND FURTHER INCHING DOLLARS ON CAMPUSES THAT ARE NEEDED TO OFFER PROGRAMS AND SERVICES OCCULTATIONS STAFF. LORD AGAIN THE BUY DOWN OF PENSION LIABILITY EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTION RATES. WE APPRECIATE THE INCLUSION OF THE SYSTEM SUPPORT. SYSTEM SUPPORT PROPOSAL PRESENTS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR GREATER ALIGNMENT BETTER COORDINATION AND ELIMINATION OF SILOS ACROSS A STATUTORILY REQUIRED SET ASIDES AND IT ALSO PROVIDES GREATER TRANSPARENCY- AND EFFORTS THAT WILL ALLOW. YOU IDENTIFIED COST SAVINGS THESE COST SAVINGS WILL ALLOW US TO BETTER SERVE OTHER UNMET NEEDS- AND AGAIN PROVIDES THE FLEXIBILITY THAT WE NEED ESPECIALLY- AS WE ENTER THIS RECESSION. LASTLY I WANT TO MENTION THAT WE DO VALUE THAT ARE THERE ARE CONTINUING- PROPOSALS INCLUDED FOR CAPITAL OUTLAY THESE PROGRAMS WILL KEEP CALIFORNIANS WORKING. SOME OF THE DEEP CONCERNING ELEMENTS OF THE BAND I REVISION ARE ONES- AS I MENTIONED REDUCTIONS TO APPORTIONMENT THAT REDUCE OVERALL- PER STUDENT FUNDING BY STRONG WORK FORCE DOWN TO A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FROM TWO HUNDRED FORTY EIGHT AGAIN AT A POINT WHERE WE NEED MORE EMPLOYMENT EFFORTS NOT LAST. AND THEN LASTLY- CONCERNED ABOUT CATEGORICAL THAT HAD BEEN SUPPORTING MANY OF THE STUDENTS THAT WERE LEFT OUT OF THE CAROUSEL- AS YOU KNOW ARE THE CARERS ACT ARBITRARILY LEFT OUT EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND STUDENTS BASED ON THE DEFINITIONS UTILIZED BY THE U. S. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. EQUITY AND ACHIEVEMENT PROGRAM HAS BEEN THERE TO SUPPORT THOSE PROGRAMS IN THOSE STUDENTS THAT WERE NOT INCLUDED IN THOSE DEFINITIONS. SO WE ARE. INSTEAD CONSIDER A COUPLE OF OPTIONS THAT YOU CONSIDER INVESTING MORE IN STRONG WORK FORCE NOT LESS AGAIN. WILL BE SENT WHEN CALIFORNIANS BACK TO WORK RE ENGAGING THEM- AND MEETING THEIR REEMPLOYMENT NEEDS. WE ALSO KNOW THAT COVER NINETEEN HAS EXPOSED ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DISPARITIES SO WE ASK THAT YOU FURTHER INVESTING COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND THOUGH ARE YOU MAY% NEED TO TURN TO I'M COMIN OR UNCONVENTIONAL OPTIONS SUCH AS INVESTING THREE CALLS FROM NINE NINETY EIGHT SOURCES WE DO THINK THAT IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO FOR CALIFORNIA IF WE DON'T WANT TO FURTHER WIDEN. THE DEGREE GAP. WE ASKED FOR GREATER FLEXIBILITY IN USE OF FUNDS OPTIONS ARE I THANK THE TEAM SUCH. AS BY THE WAY UP THE LOTTERY FUNDS IN DEATH. ON HOW WE CAN YOU KNOW THE RESTRICT DOLLAR. AND REVISITING PRO LIKE. TO ENSURE THAT WE ALSO SERVE STUDENTS SEEKING RE EMPLOYMENT THROUGH THAT CATEGORICAL PROGRAM. SO I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE SEVERAL OTHER QUESTIONS AND I'M HAPPY TO ADDRESS THOSE LATER BUT THESE ARE SOME OF THE INITIAL POINT AND OBSERVATIONS FROM THE MAY REVISION. THANK YOU SENATOR ROCK MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR CALLING US QUESTIONS. SEVERAL MAYBE FOR THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM HI HOW ARE YOUR INSTITUTION'S POISE TO HANDLE THE DEFERRALS ARE. THE PROPOSED. SO WHAT ARE THE KEY TWENTY TWENTY ONE PROPOSALS- GIVEN THEY IF WE'RE ABLE TO PROVIDE THOSE RESOURCES SHORTLY AFTER THE START OF THE FISCAL YEAR WE DO BELIEVE THAT SEVERAL COLLEGES WILL BE ABLE TO MANAGE THEM- WE FORWARD THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE RESOURCES DIFFERED INTO TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO ALL WE KNOW THAT COLLEGES WILL HAVE VARYING DEGREES- THE ABILITY TO HANDLE THOSE I. DEPENDING ON THEIR THEIR PHYSICAL HEALTH CONDITIONS LOCALLY- HOWEVER WE DO NOTE THAT IT IS- A BETTER APPROACH TO PROVIDE REFERRALS AND OVERALL. LONG TERM AND PERMANENT CUTS TO OF COURSE- AT DEFERRALS AT A MINIMUM COME BACK TO COLLEGES THAT WE CAN REINVEST THOSE RESOURCES AND AT ANOTHER TIME BUT WE ARE AGAIN CONCERNED- WITH SOME DISTRICTS IN ABILITY TO MANAGE- FOR TWENTY ONE TWENTY. WHEN WE FIRST THROUGH. TECHNOLOGY INSTRUCTION OCCUR TO THEM HOWVER THE DISTRICTS THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICTS HOW THEY'VE BEEN PERFORMING IN THAT REGARD ARE THERE ANY RESTRICTIONS STATUTORILY- THAT ARE IN PLACE THAT WE NEED TO DEAL WITH IN ORDER TO ALLOW. THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM TO EQUIP ITSELF AND THE STUDENTS TO CONTINUE TO LEARN ONLINE IF THAT BECOMES A- NECESSARY CONTINUES TO BE NECESSARY OR APPROPRIATE IN THE FUTURE. SENATOR ROTH'S COUPLE OF THE POINTS HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED ACTUALLY IN THE BUDGET- CURRENT STATUE THE 50% LAW REQUIRES THAT- 50% OF ALL RESOURCES RECEIVE GENERAL FUND RESOURCES RECEIVED BY A COLLEGE THE EXPANDED ON- SALARIES- AND BENEFITS FOR TENURE TRACK. MICHAEL T. THAT MEANS THAT- COLLEGES HAVE HAD TO EXPEND A LOT MORE- ON WHAT IS CONSIDERED ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE 50% LIVE THIS YER AS WE TRANSITIONED INTO ONLINE LEARNING MODALITIES AND DISTANCE. EDUCATION DELIVERY THE EXEMPTION- TO CURB SHEET THE ABILITY TO EXACT SOME OF THOSE COSTS RELATED TO THAT QUICK TRANSITION FROM THE 50% LEVEL PROVIDE FLEXIBILITY OTHERWISE WITHOUT THAT FLEXIBILITY WOULD HAVE TO FURTHER PENALIZED- COLLEGES BY REDUCING THEIR APPORTIONMENT. SO THAT'S FLEXIBILITY THAT- IS VALUABLE AT THIS TIME AN EXPANDED X. AT AN EXPECTED EXPENSES. THE OTHER AREA THAT WE'VE HIGHLIGHTED IS AROUND A LOTTERY FUNDS THERE IS AN ANTIQUATED DEFINITION IN THE LOTTERY FUNDS ON WHAT IS CONSIDERED- INSTRUCTIONAL EQUIPMENT. INCLUDES DEFINITIONS SUCH AS AUDIO TAPES AND DISKS- WITH THOSE EXPENSES THAT ARE NOT RELATED TO THE CURRENT DELIVERY- OF TECHNOLOGY IN THE USE. THE OTHER IS AROUND- PROMISE PROGRAMS THIS IS STILL INCLUDES DEFINITIONS FOR FULL TIME STUDENTS AND SO- GREATER FLEXIBILITY AND- UTILIZING SOME OF THOSE FUNDS TO SERVE A BROADER ARRAY OF STUDENTS THAT MAY HAVE NEEDS CAN ALSO BE VALUABLE. FOR COLLEGES IN SERVING THESE POPULATIONS. WHAT THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THE RESPONSE OR ANY. AND SO I HAVE TO SAY I'M- I'M CONCERNED ABOUT ALL OF THE CUTS WERE HAVING TO MAKE A- THIS YEAR OR PROPOSE TO MAKE THIS YEAR ACROSS THE BOARD K. TWO FOURTEEN HIGHER ED. IN THE AREA OF COMMUNITY COLLEGE I'VE COLLEGES I'M CONCERNED THAT. OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES WE EXPECT TO BE THE ACCESS POINT IN MANY CASES TO OUR FOUR YEAR INSTITUTIONS. AND OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES FRANKLY THE SOLUTION TO- FOR MANY ANYWAY TO THE EVER CHANGING WORKPLACE CERTAINLY THAT WE'VE EXPERIENCED IN THE PAST. IN THIS TWENTY FIRST CENTURY AND CERTAINLY. THE WORKPLACE THAT WE'RE PROBABLY GOING TO. EXPECT TO SEE POST CODE SO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO. TO DEAL WITH THIS BUT THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS NO OTHER QUESTIONS. THIS IS A HOLD OPEN ITEM LET'S MOVE ON TO ISSUE SEVENTY SEVEN. BECAUSE STRONG WORK FORCE PROGRAM ADULT EDUCATION AND APPRENTICESHIPS DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. HI MICHELLE NEWMAN AGAIN WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- AS NOTED IN THE GENDER AND THE MAY REVISION PROPOSES A REDUCTION TO THE CALIFORNIA COLLEGES STRONG WORKFORCE PROGRAM OF A HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS- AT ROUGHLY EDUCATION PROGRAM- AS WELL AS ANY- 15% REDUCTION IN APPROXIMATELY EIGHTEEN POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE PROPOSED CALVARY. COMMUNITY SYSTEM SUPPORT PROGRAM WHICH WAS PROPOSED DURING THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET- AND CONTINUES TO BE PROPOSED AT THE MAY REVISION- WITH THIS ADDITIONAL REDUCTION. BUT WITHOUT HAVING TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. WELL LET ME HAVE THIS GO A LITTLE BIT OUT OF SEQUENCE HERE AND JUST I WAS LOOKING AT. AT OUR AGENDA AND THE INFORMATION THAT WE WERE PROVIDED- OVER THE WEEKEND AND- OUR AGENDA. HAS A NOTED. IN ADDITION TO THE TRIGGER REDUCTION THE MAY REVISION ALSO PROPOSES TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO REQUIRE COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICTS. TO EXPEDITE THE DEVELOPMENT OF TARGETED CREDIT OR NON CREDIT SHORT TERM WORKFORCE TRAINING PROGRAMS THAT FOCUS ON. ONE ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND RESULT IN JOB PLACEMENT TO RE SKILLING AND UP SKILLING. AND THREE HAVE AT LEAST ONE PROVEN EMPLOYER PARTNER DEMONSTRATE JOB VACANCIES AND SUBMIT VERIFICATION TO THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE IN MY- MARGIN NOTES TO MYSELF THIS ISN'T THIS THE CALIBRATE MISSION. AND HOW DOES THAT ALL RELATE. I GUESS FINANCE. WHEN. WELL THAT WAS GOOD. THE FASTEST EVER. YES CHRIS FERGUSON WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO- THE SPECIFIC LANGUAGE THAT YOU SEE IN THE STRONG WORK FORCE PROGRAM IS RELATIVE TO AN EXPECTATION THAT WAS ESTABLISHED WHEN THE PROGRAM WAS ESTABLISHED AND THAT IN. THAT PROGRAM EXPECTED COLLEGES TO BE ABLE TO CREATE A PROGRAM WITHIN SIX MONTHS AND OFFERED THE FOLLOWING SEMESTER SO CREATED THIS SEMESTER SAY THE FALL SEMESTER AND OFFERED THE SPRING SEMESTER THE FLEXIBILITY IN THE LANGUAGE THAT WE PUT FORWARD IS FLEXIBILITY THAT WOULD ALLOW COLLEGES CREATE PROGRAM MUCH MORE EXPEDITIOUSLY THAN THAT SIX MONTH POP FRAME. WHAT ENABLED TO DO DO SOMETHING THAT A LITTLE MORE FLEX THAN THEY DO TODAY BUT ALSO IT'S WITHIN THE ACT HOW. IN THE STRUCTURE THEY COLLEGES HAVE WERE IT'S HELD HAD A LOCAL POINT TO START THOSE. AT DIFFERENT POINTS DURING THE TRADITIONAL YEAR I'M SO IT'S NOT QUITE THE SAME. OKAY WELL I APOLOGIZE FOR GOING OUT OF SEQUENCE I JUST WANTED TO IT WAS JUST. INTERESTING TO ME AND I WANTED TO ASK THE QUESTION I APOLOGIZE I APOLOGIZE TO MY COLLEAGUES AND APPRECIATE THEIR INDULGENCE. HELLO ISSUE SEVENTY SEVEN. THIS NEWS. YOU THINKING THAT THE LEGISLATIVE OFFICE. ON THIS ISSUE EMAIL ADDED STATE PRIME SUPPORT CRITIC QUESTION BECAUSE A COLLEGES THROUGH QUESTION. BUT IT ALSO SUPPLEMENTAL FOR THESE COURSES THROUGH THE STRONG WORK FORCE PROGRAM IS INTENDED TO REFLECT CTE COURSES COMMONLY HAVE HIGHER INSTRUCTIONAL COSTS IT IS SMALLER CLASS SIZES AND SPECIALIZED EQUIPMENT NEEDS. THERE ARE PREFERRED ALSO PROVIDES FUNDING FOR REGIONAL COORDINATION. PLANNING IN THE COMING YEARS BEING IN FOR. CTE COURSES BUT COLLEGES I. WORKERS SOME OF WHOM HAD LOST JOBS. TURNING TO SCHOOL ADDITIONAL RISK AROUND. AND WE THINK THE STRONG WORK FORCE PRO COULD HELP. NEED THAT INCREASED IN. WHAT IN MIND AS AN ALTERNATE TO COVER MAYOR OF A PROPOS. YOU KNOW IT'S NOT TO RE FUN FROM OTHER. IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN. A COMPARABLE LEVEL FUNDING FOR THE WORK PROGRAM. THE CURRENT MODEL. WE SHOULD BE LOCKED OF SOUTH. WOULD BE HAPPY TO DISCUSS THE FURTHER YOU HAVE ANY. PARIS PROPOSE FOR IT ALL THAT YOU. CONDITIONS IN AMERICA SHIN. WE CAN THESE PROPOSALS AREAS AND OF THIS FISCAL CONSTRAINTS. THANK YOU I'LL BE HAPPY TAKING. WE MAY HAVE SOME A MINUTE I'LL TRY TO FOLLOW DANCE. SO LET'S GO TO THE CAL COMMUNITY. REPRESENTATIVES I THINK TO FIVE AND SHARED EARLIER IN MY OPENING COMMENTS WE ARE CONCERNED WITH THE CUTS USE STRONG WORK FORCE GIVEN THAT LIKELIHOOD OF. INCREASED DEMAND ESPECIALLY IN THESE PROGRAMS STRONG WORK FORCE PROGRAMS SUPPORTS THE DEVELOPMENT OF A REGIONALLY AND RESPONSIVE THE EMPLOYER PROGRAMS- AND ENABLE US TO PROVIDE SHORT TERM PROGRAMS THAT CAN. PUT CALIFORNIANS BACK TO WORK SO WE DO ASK THAT YOU SEEK ALTERNATE APPROACHES ARE ADDITIONAL NINE NINETY FINDING IF NEEDED- TO SUPPORT AND STRONG WORK FORCE PROGRAMS- IN RIAN FUSE THIS NECESSARY INVESTMENTS. OKAY YOU A CALL CEMEX. ELEVEN FOR ME HAS GOOD. WHATEVER PERHAPS YOU COULD COMMENT ON THE L. A. O.'S ALTERNATIVE. HAVING TO DO WITH THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE FROM WORK FORCE PROGRAM VIS A VIS THE- AND TO TWELVE STRONG WORK FORCE PROGRAM. SINCE. COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE GENERALLY PART OF THE BOTH CONSORTIA ARE INTO. IT'S A COMMUNITY COLLEGES WORK- THE STRONG WORK FORCE PROGRAM HAS TWO ELEMENTS HAS A LOCAL LEVEL FUNDING 60% STRONG WORKFORCE DOLLARS REMAIN LOCALLY 40% ARE UTILIZED FOR REGIONAL COORDINATION AND PLANNING- THE OTHER PORTION OF IT IS ALSO THE K. TWELVE STRONG WORK FORCE. ONE OF THE KEY ROLES THAT THIS THIS PORTION OF FUNDING FROM PROVIDED IS ACTUALLY MORE OF A PASS THROUGH THE PROGRAM THAT GOES AND SERVICE PRIMARILY T. TWELVE- WE BELIEVE THAT THE ALLEY A PROPOSAL ON THIS AREA IS ONE WORTH LOOKING AT ESPECIALLY SINCE AGAIN- THE K. TWELVE QUESTIONS STRONG WORK FORCE IS PRIMARILY A PASS THROUGH- OF FUNDS THAT ARE NOT NECESSARILY GOING TO. COMMUNITY COLLEGES WE DO THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO PRESERVE THE REGIONAL FOCUS- AS WELL AS THAT THE LOCAL LEVEL FUNDING YOU CAN CONSIDER YEAH A SLIGHTLY. ATTRIBUTIONS ABOUT MORE TO FROM THE LOCAL BUT STILL I GET THE BIGGEST ISSUE IS THE OVERALL 55% CUT TO THE TWO STRONG WORK FOR I'M AT A TIME WHEN AGAIN I WILL LET WE'RE LIKELY TO SEE MORE DEMAND IN THE AREA. THAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO THE SIXTY FORTY SPLIT. THAT'S CORRECT. AND IS THERE SOME READJUSTMENT THAT THE. SYSTEM WOULD PROPOSE. I KNOW IF WHAT HOW DOES THAT AND OF THE- WHEN I'M COULD BE LOOKING AT SEVEN THIRTY. AGAIN REMAINING ME. THE REGION PARTNERS IN THE REGION STRUCTURE WHAT ALL WHEN SHE THAT I'M ARE THEY LOOK. TO YOU FOR PRO AND SERVICES HERE TO SUPPLEMENT THE COST OF CREATING THESE PROGRAMS- ESPECIALLY RECOGNIZING THAT MANY OF THESE PROGRAMS WILL HAVE TO BE OFFERED UNDER SOCIAL DISTANCING REQUIRE RE REQUIREMENTS AND MAY INCREASE THE COSTS WE CAN GET A LOOK AT A DISTRIBUTION AGAIN- ONCE WE KNOW MORE ACCURATELY THE AMOUNT.

I MEAN I'M NOT BEING SMART WITH THE QUESTION I WAS JUST CURIOUS IT'S GOING TO MAKE A DIFFICULT ISN'T IT. YES IT IT IT. IT IS DIFFICULT AND WE RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS A VERY DIFFICULT TIME- FOR COLLEGES THAT AS WELL AS OUR STUDENTS RIGHT NOW. SO WE RECOGNIZE THAT WE ARE WE ARE ASKING FOR COLLEGES TO DO MORE IN THIS INSTANCE- BUT THE STUDENT EQUITY AND ACHIEVEMENT PROGRAM IT IS THE LARGEST CATEGORICAL PROGRAM THAT THAT COLLEGES USE AND WE EXPECT THAT THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO- STILL. ON AN ALLOCATION BY SUPPORTING THOSE OTHER PROGRAMS. OKAY FINE I APPRECIATE THOSE. HELLO THE NAME REVISION PROPOSES CUTS TO VARIOUS STUDENTS OF SUPPORT FACULTY SUPPORT AND SYSTEM WIDE PROGRAMS UNDER MAY REVISE THESE CUTS WOULD BE ROUGHLY 15% FOR EACH THOUGH- ACADEMIC SENATES CUT ACTUALLY WOULD BE ABOUT 25% OF THE BASE FUNDING. SO COMMITTING MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER REPRIORITIZE THE REDUCTIONS. PRIORITIZING THEM IN A DIFFERENT WAY AND WHAT THE GOVERNOR'S DONE. IF CUTS HAVE TO BE MADE- PERHAPS START WITH THE SYSTEM WIDE ADMINISTRATIVE PROGRAMS THE SYSTEM THE SUPPORT PROGRAM YOU JUST HEARD ABOUT MANY ACTIVITIES FUNDED IN THE SYSTEM- SUPPORT PROGRAM INVOLVED IN PERSON CONFERENCES AND TRAVEL. THE MEDIA CAMPAIGNS AND THEY'RE ALSO THE COMMITTEE MIGHT WANT TO CUT THIS PROGRAM DEEPER THAN WHAT MADE DOES. ANY TURN. THAT MIGHT PROVIDE ANOTHER TO PRESERVE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE- BECAUSE THE PROGRAMS ARE PROVIDED DIRECT SERVICES TO STUDENTS SO YOU JUST HEARD ABOUT THE STUDENT EQUITY AND ACHIEVEMENT PROGRAM. WHICH IS AIMED AT REDUCING ACHIEVEMENT GAPS OF THROUGH TUTORING AND COUNSELING AND OTHER ENHANCED SERVICES SO IT'S REALLY AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO ASSERT ITS OWN PRIORITIES IN THE BUDGET AND WE ACTUALLY WOULD WOULD THAT GO WAY YOU JUST MENTIONED. SENATOR ROCK ABOUT. THE ABILITY TO CALL IT TO. TAKE ON TWO NEW RESPONSIBILITIES OR REQUIREMENTS WITH THE FOOD PANTRIES AND THE DREAMER RESOURCE LIAISONS WHEN THEY HAVE. PERHAPS. SIXTY EIGHT TO SIXTY NINE MILLION DOLLARS LESS THAN WHAT'S CURRENTLY FIND IT. SO THAT'S ANOTHER REASON WHY YOU MIGHT WANT TO MINIMIZE. ANY REDUCTIONS TO THIS- EQUITY AND ACHIEVEMENT PROGRAM TO ALLOW THEM TO BETTER RESPOND ALL THE CHALLENGES OF VARIOUS. GROUPS OF STUDENTS AT THE COLLEGES ARE. THANK YOU. MR READ PERHAPS YOU COULD- PROVIDE SOME COMMENTS AND IN PARTICULAR IN INCLUDING YOUR CALL INCLUDED IN YOUR COMMENTS MAYBE RESPOND TO THE SYSTEM OF SUPPORT PROGRAM COMMENTS OF THE LA I REALIZE YOU'RE NOT. IN A POSITION TO NEGOTIATE AGAINST YOURSELF BUT I WONDER IF THERE ARE REDUCTIONS IN SOME AREAS THAT WOULD BE EASIER TO TAKE THAN REDUCTIONS THAT ARE CURRENTLY BEING PROPOSED. THE FLOOR IS YOURS. THANK YOU I'M I WOULD ADD THAT THERE ARE OTHER CATEGORICAL STYLE WITH A MORE EXPANSIVE DEFINITION OF THINGS THAT CAN BE UTILIZED CAN ALSO SUPPORT SOME OF THE KEY MISSIONS IDENTIFIED IN THE SYSTEM WORK AGAIN HE ADDED THAT IS AGAIN REMAINING AND MAINTAINING THE OVERALL- AFTERWARDS THAT THEY COLLEGE PROMISE PROVIDES. WITH ANY MORE EXPANSIVE DEFINITION YOU CAN MEET SOME OF THE GOALS IDENTIFIED IN SYSTEM WOULD BE- AND THEN TO EQUITY AND ACHIEVEMENT PROGRAM AND SERVE A BROADER. AND MAY HAVE NEED ON JALEN THE SYSTEM SUPPORT MY WAYS REPRESENTS OPPORTUNE TO BETTER SERVE THEM BETTER. LIMITED RESOURCE RESEARCH THAT ARE CURRENTLY IN FIFTY ONE PURSE TO SERVE THE ENTIRE ONE HADN'T COLLEGES SEVENTY THREE AND TWO POINT ONE MILLION STUDENTS THIS WOULD ALLOW US TO PROVIDE AND SERVICE KIND OF SCALE MY MASK. EARLIER YOU ABOUT TAKING NEEDS ONE NEED HAS NOT BEEN FUNDED AND WE'LL GO ON MAX WITHOUT FUN FOR AND ALLOW FLEXIBILITY IN WHAT IS THIS SINCE ORTIZ LIKE THE LIBRARY SERVICE. THIS ALLOWS FROM ANY OF THE CALL THAT THEY CAN TO ABLE TO. UTILIZE AN ACT PERIODICALS ANYTHING THAT THEY NEED FOR RESEARCH THAT IS SOMETHING THAT THE SYSTEM SUPPORT COULD POTENTIALLY FIND WITH IDENTIFIED COST SAVINGS MINIMIZE COST CUTTERS SPENDS ON- FISCAL AGENT AGREEMENTS AND THEN AGAIN YES AS THE ELLIE- DID IDENTIFY THERE WILL BE COST SAVINGS FROM LESS TROUBLING CONVENTION THANK YOU ABSOLUTELY DELIGHTS TO BETTER SERVE STATEWIDE NEEDS IN A MORE COHESIVE. AND TRANSPARENT MANNER. SIXTY FOUR FORTY UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SIXTY SIX HUNDRED HASTINGS COLLEGE OF LAW AND SIXTY SIX TEN CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY. ISSUE SEVENTY NINE OPERATING BUDGET REDUCTION. AFFIRMATIVE FINANCE. GOOD MORNING KAREN MEMBERS BRIANNA FRIENDS DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE PRETTY EASY AND THE SCO THE MAYOR VERSION REMOVES MOST OF THE NEW PROPOSAL PROVIDED AT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THAT MAINTAINS MET BUT MAINTAINS SEVERAL PROPOSALS INCLUDING ELEVEN POINT THREE MILLION ONGOING GENERAL FUND FOR THE UC RIVERSIDE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE TICKET TO SUPPORT CURRENT OPERATIONS. ONE POINT TWO MILLION ONGOING GENERAL FUND FOR UCSF SCHOOL OF MEDICINE FRESNO BRANCH CAMPUS TO SUPPORT AN EXISTING UCSF UC MERCED PARTNERSHIP. AND FIVE MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND FOR ANIMAL SHELTER DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS. THE MAYOR VISION ALSO PROPOSES FURTHER ADJUSTMENTS TO MAKE THEM CONTINGENT ON A FEDERAL FUNDING UNLESS AND UNTIL SUFFICIENT INCREASES IN FEDERAL SUPPORT ARE AVAILABLE FOR PROGRAM RESTORATION. EVEN ACTIONS ARE NECESSARY TO BALANCE THE STATE BUDGET THEY INCLUDE THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT MILLION FROM THE UCC MAIN GENERAL FUND ITEM AND THREE HUNDRED NINETY EIGHT MILLION FROM CST IS REFLECTING A 10% REDUCTION IN EACH. THIRTY FOUR MILLION FROM THESE THESE OTHER GENERAL FUND ITEM FOR THE UC OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT USE THE PATH AND THE DIVISION OF AGRICULTURE AND NATURAL RESOURCES. AND FOUR MILLION FOR THE UC AND SIX MILLION FOR THE CSTO SUPPORT SUMMER TERM FINANCIAL AID. BUT THAT AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE. WELL THANK YOU. HELLO I'VE- LIVED HERE FROM YOU AND- YOU HAD SOME ALTERNATIVE SUGGESTIONS. HE DOESN'T. THIS IS GOING TO BE CHASING CONSTANT TAURUS. HOW ARE YOU SIR. ARE YOU SENATOR I'M FINE TAKE IT AWAY. THAT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE INTRACELLULAR. FROM THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL FOCUSED ON BASE REDUCTIONS IN OUR VIEW IS WARRANTED GIVEN THE STATES OF STRUCTURAL BUDGET DEFICIT HOWEVER WE WOULD NOTE THAT THE TIMING OF THESE RDUCTIONS I'M ALL FOR THE SEGMENTS A LITTLE TIME TO RESPOND TO THE REDUCTIONS IN THE WAY THEY HAVE. IN PREVIOUS RECESSIONS FOR EXAMPLE ABOVE CERTAIN CAMPUS THE CAMPUS IS A BOTH A UNIVERSITY SYSTEMS HAVE LARGELY MADE FULL ADMISSIONS DECISIONS FOR THEIR ABILITY TO ADJUSTABLE NEXT ARM IS SOMEWHAT LIMITED AT THIS POINT- LIKEWISE- THEIR ABILITY TO INCREASE TUITION TO OFFSET SOME OF THESE REDUCTIONS ALSO SOMEWHAT LIMITED. GIVEN THE STUDENT CONSULTATION EXPECTATIONS ABOUT. THE LEGISLATURE HAS MEETINGS SEGMENTS. FROM WHAT MINE ARE IS SHE HAS YOU KNOW DIDN'T DEVELOPING A MUSTARD OF ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER TAKING. ON WHAT WITHOUT AIM OF REDUCING- I'M OF A NOTABLE PORTION OF THE SPACE REDUCTIONS. I'M THE STAFF AND SO I WON'T GO INTO GREAT DETAIL ABOUT NOT. ALTERNATIVELY THAT UP FOR Q. NA ALL BUT THE ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS OF THE ALTERNATIVE ARE- TO REFER MORE ONE TIME I SPEND ONE TIME FUNDING THAT WAS PROVIDED LAST YEAR'S BUDGET. ONTO BOTH UNIVERSITY SEGMENTS- WE THINK THERE COULD BE YOU- HELLO HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS IN TOTAL IT ALL STRESSED AND SAD- COULD BE REVERTED MOSTLY FOR- DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. AREA WE THINK THE LEGISLATURE COULD FOCUS A LOT OF ATTENTION ON IS- DRYING DOWN CAMPUS RESEARCH UNDER THIS APPROACH THE LEGISLATURE WOULD STILL INACTIVE BUDGET REDUCTION- BUT THE SEGMENTS WOULD MAINTAIN A PORTION OF THEIR OPERATIONS BY DRAWING DOWN RESEARCH. ON BOTH SEGMENTS HAD. I JUST OVER A DOLLARS IN CORPS RESERVE. I'M OUT AND A PORTION OF THOSE RESERVES A LOT HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS WAS AVAILABLE SPECIFICALLY FOR ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTIES AND AT. A CERTAIN ADVANCED FOR COMMITTED TO CERTAIN CASTALDO CAMPUSES MIGHT BE TRYING TO REVISIT SOME OF THESE COMMITMENTS IN LIGHT OF THE CURRENT OUTBREAK. I'M LOOKING AT THE DATA WE FELT THAT MAYBE UP TO TWO HUNDRED MILLION ACTS YES YOU HAVE UP TO A HUNDRED MILLION THAT YOU SEE- COULD BE DRAWN DOWN FOR RESEARCH TO HELP MITIGATE. PRODUCTIONS WE HAD A FEW OPTIONS TO MAYBE OFFER SOME MORE TARGETED REDUCTIONS WERE THOSE JOBS STILL NEEDED EVEN IN LIGHT OF. WE'RE SENDING ONE TIME FUNDING AND DRAWING DOWN RESERVES FOR EXAMPLE FOR YOU SEE POTENTIALLY TARGETING SOME REDUCTIONS TOWARDS PROGRAMS THAT- ARE LESS RELATED TO INSTRUCTION OR A NEED BASED FINANCIAL AID FOR STUDENTS TO THINGS LIKE RESEARCH FOR EXAMPLE. ONE MORE THING I WOULD EMPHASIZE IS THAT WHERE THE LEGISLATURE TAKE ALL APPROACH. THE LEGISLATURE WOULD STILL. FACE DFFICULT DECISIONS IN THE FOLLOWING BUDGET SO IT'S NOT A PERMANENT SOLUTION THE- IDEA HERE WOULD BE TO MINIMIZE MOST OF THE REDUCTIONS. AND GIVE BOTH UNIVERSITY SEGMENTS MORE TIME TO RESPOND TO START THINKING ABOUT AND WILL NEED TO START THINKING ABOUT TUITION AND START THINKING ABOUT- YOU'RE VERY DEFICIENCIES OPERATIONAL REDUCTIONS OF ANY GIVE YOU MORE TIME TO REVIEW THAT SEARCH. ENGINES ARE MAKING. IS IT YOUR THOUGHT THAT. WE WOULD ALLOW THE US TO SYSTEMS WHETHER IT'S YOU SEE YOUR C. ISSUE. TO DETERMINE WHICH DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROJECTS TO PROCEED WITH AND SOME THAT BOOK PERHAPS ARE DEEMED ESSENTIAL WOULD BE ALLOWED TO PROCEED AND THOSE THAT. ARE DEEMED LESS ESSENTIAL SINCE I'M SURE THEY'RE ALL ESSENTIAL BUT LESS ESSENTIAL UNDER THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT. WOULD BE POSTPONED AND THAT MONEY DIVERTED TO ALLOW THEM TO DIVERT THAT THE INSTITUTION TO DIVERT TAT MONEY. INTO CORPS CORE FUNCTION. YEAH THAT'S THAT'S CORRECT WE WERE THINKING- BUT BASICALLY THAT WITH THE FUNDS HAVEN'T BEEN COMMITTED. ALREADY FUNDS THAT HAVE BEEN COMMITTED TO ANY PROJECT JUST SIMPLY BE REVERTED. TO THE CENTER OF THE FUNDS HAVE ALREADY BEEN COMMITTED- OBVIOUSLY THOSE WOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR RECURSION BUT ANY ANY CASE WHERE THE FUNDS ARE SPENT WE WOULD THINK. WOULD BE WE WOULD WE WOULD THINK DIVERT THOSE FUNDS. THERE IS TO THE CAMPUS RESERVE A CAMPUS RESERVES THE SAME. A LOT OF SYSTEMS TO DETERMINE. THE LEVEL OF RESERVES AT STATE MINIMUM ESSENTIAL LEVEL OF RESERVE AND- AND BURN THROUGH THE REST IF NECESSARY TO SUPPORT CORE FUNCTION. YEAH HERE WE WERE THINKING THAT THE LEGISLATURE WOULD WORK WITH THE SEGMENTS TO- THINK ABOUT AT A HIGH LEVEL OF YOU KNOW RESERVES THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO BE DRAWN DOWN AGAIN WE SORT OF. JUST LOOKING OUT THERE- RESERVES PRIOR TO THE OUTBREAK. SINCE YOU THE RECORD HOLDER RESERVED FOR ABOUT ONE POINT FIVE BILLION YOU SEE WAS ABOUT ONE POINT ONE BILLION- OF THAT AMOUNT MOST. DIFFICULT PORTION WAS COMMITTED FOR THINGS LIKE CONTRACTS. IN NEW FACULTY STARTUP CONTRACTS AND CAPITAL OUTLAY THE REST WAS UNRESTRICTED. ON IN ANY CASE IF YOU SEE IN SOME CASES THERE AREN'T EVEN FORMAL POLICIES ON. A DESIGNATED THINGS RESERVED FOR SPECIFIC PRIORITIES AND SO WE FELT KIND OF LOOKING AT THAT DATA AND SERVER RECOGNIZING THAT THERE MIGHT BE SOME DEFICIT SPENDING GOING ON CURRENTLY. BUT ALSO THAT THERE COULD BE SOME. RIGHT COULD BE MAKING TO TRY THAT- ELEVEN REDUCE SOME OF THE COMMITMENTS THEY MADE WE THOUGHT THOSE TWO HUNDRED MILLION A HUNDRED MILLION LEVELS COULD BE A REASONABLE STARTING POINT FOR THE LEGISLATURE BUT THAT WAS THAT'S WHAT IT WOULD BE A REASONABLE STARTING POINT FOR DISCUSSION. SECONDS I'LL BE INTERESTED IN HEARING FROM THE- THE INSTITUTIONS OTHER PERSPECTIVE IS THE AUTHOR. THAT'S IT THANK YOU OKAY ABOUT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR OFF THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M SAFER CANNON FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA I PROVIDED A HANDOUT WITH A BLUE COVERED TO COMMITTEE STAFF AND WILL BE REFERRING TO IT DURING MY PRESENTATION. A PERMANENT FINANCE IN LA- HAVE DISCUSSED THE STATE IS FACING SIGNIFICANT LOSS OF REVENUE FROM CODE NINETEEN AND UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IS NO EXCEPTION. UNIVERSITY MAKES TO ASK OF THE SENATE. IF YOU APPROVE A BUDGET THAT MAINTAINS THE UNIVERSITY'S GENERAL FUND ALLOCATION. AT THE LEVELS PROVIDED IN THE BUDGET ACT OF TWENTY NINETEEN. AND THE GREATEST DEGREE POSSIBLE AS THE STATE RECEIVES FEDERAL FUNDS YOU CONSIDERED THE UNIVERSITY HAS A STRONG INVESTMENT. LIKE TO DETAILS UNIVERSITIES COVERED NINETEEN RELATED FINANCIAL LOSSES THROUGH APRIL THIRTIETH. A TOTAL OF NEARLY ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN EXPENDITURES AND LOST REVENUES. AS THE WORLD'S LARGEST PUBLIC RESEARCH UNIVERSITY OUR ACADEMIC HEALTH CENTERS ARE TREATING PATIENTS OUR RESEARCHERS ARE SEEKING THERAPIES AND VACCINES WE ARE PROVIDING OUR TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND STUDENTS WITH REMOTE INSTRUCTION. AND CONTINUING TO EMPLOY OUR HUNDRED SEVENTY THOUSAND EMPLOYEES. THE UNIVERSITY HAS ACCESS TO OVER TWO HUNDRED SIXTY MILLION IN FEDERAL SUPPORT PROVIDED BY THE KERR SACKED ONE HALF OF WHICH GOES TO CAMPUSES AND THE OTHER HALF IS DIRECT EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE THE STUDENTS. A HUNDRED AND THIRTY SEVEN POINT THREE MILLION THE CAMPUSES WILL RECEIVE COVERS ONLY A FRACTION OF THE COST ATTRIBUTABLE TO COPE WITH NINETEEN. USING THESE ACADEMIC CELL HEALTH CENTERS HAVE RECEIVED AN ADDITIONAL TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT MILLION TO DATE IN THE CARADOC FUNDING FOR HOSPITALS AGAIN THIS WILL NOT ONLY COVER. THE FIVE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE MILLION IN LOST REVENUES FROM CANCELED SURGERIES AND OTHER MEDICAL CARE. THE UNIVERSITY WILL ALSO TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE OF BEING A REIMBURSEMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR PANDEMIC RELATED COSTS BUT FEMA REIMBURSES ACTUAL EXPENDITURES ONLY AND NOT LOST REVENUES. DO THE CODE NINETEEN IMPACTS CAMPUSES HAVE LOST MIKE'S ABILITY WITH FUNDING. WE HAVE ALSO IN EVERY AREA OF OUR OPERATIONS AND WE DON'T YET KNOW WHERE THE BOTTOM IS. DURING PRIOR ECONOMIC DOWNTURNS UNIVERSITY HAD OPTIONS FOR INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL BORROWING TO CHRISTIAN PRODUCTIONS AND NOW THAT OPTION FOR BORROWING IS NOT AVAILABLE IN THE SAME WAY WE ARE NOW FAR MORE CONSTRAINED. WITH THAT CONTEXT IN MIND I WILL ASK YOU T TURN TO SLIDE THREE. THE CHART ON SLIDE THREE SHOWS THE CORE FUNDS PER STUDENT. EACH BAR ON THE CHART REPRESENTS TOTAL EXPENDITURES PER STUDENT. ALTHOUGH THE TOTAL AMOUNT HAS GONE UP THE MOST RECENT YEAR SHOW THE FINANCIAL AID OUR RETIREMENT PROGRAM CONTRIBUTIONS AND THE UNIVERSITY'S DEBT SERVICE ARE TAKING UP AN INCREASINGLY LARGE AMOUNTS OF THE CAMPUS FUNDING. THIS MEANS THAT ARE AVAILABLE DOLLARS PER STUDENT ARE NOW ABOUT THE SAME AS THEY WERE IN TWENTY TEN. WE ALSO FACE UNCERTAINTY REGARDING OUR INTERNATIONAL ENROLLMENTS. ARE NON RESIDENT STUDENTS CONTRIBUTE NEARLY ONE POINT THREE BILLION THE CAMPUS BUDGETS FOR SUPPLEMENTAL TUITION PAY PAY. AT THIS TIME WE DO NOT KNOW IF OUR NON RESIDENT STUDENTS WILL BE ABLE TO RETURN OR IF THEY WILL CHOOSE TO RETURN TO THEIR STUDIES AND ALL. THIS COULD IMPACT THE FUND'S OUR CAMPUS IS RELIED UPON TO EDUCATE ALL OUR STUDENTS. THIS IS THE CONTEXT IN WHICH YOU ARE ASKED TO CONSIDER THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISE RECOMMENDATION A 10% REDUCTION WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. UNIVERSITY ONLY HAS THREE POSSIBLE WAYS OF DEALING WITH REVENUE LOSSES CUTTING EXPENDITURES INCREASING REVENUES ARE USING RESERVES. CANVAS CARBINES RESERVES ARE NOT SUFFICIENT TO DEAL WITH THESE UNEXPECTED COSTS. I ASK YOU TO PLEASE TURN TO SLIDE FOUR TO SEE HOW THE UNIVERSITY INITIALLY DEALT WITH THESE UNEXPECTED EXPENSES AND LOST REVENUES. COLLECTIVELY ALL UC CHANCELLORS OF PRESIDENT APPALLING KANO ANNOUNCED ON APRIL SECOND THAT THERE WOULD BE NO COVERT NINETEEN RELATED LAY OFFS FOR CAREER EMPLOYEES. THROUGH THE END OF THE FISCAL YEAR ON JUNE THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY. THIS DECISION WAS MADE TO GIVE PEACE OF MIND ARE VALUED EMPLOYEES. AS THE THIRD LARGEST EMPLOYER IN THE STATE USE THESE ACTIONS ARE KEEPING PEOPLE EMPLOYED AS POSITIVELY IMPACTED LOCAL ECONOMIES. HOWEVER CONTINUE TO PAY OUR EMPLOYEES WHEN MULTIPLE COMPONENTS OF OUR REVENUE HAVE EXPERIENCED TREMENDOUS LOSSES IS NOT POSSIBLE WITHOUT SUTAINED STATE AND FEDERAL FUNDS. SO FAR TO CONTAIN COSTS TO CUT EXPENDITURES YOU SEE HAS TAKEN A NUMBER OF STEPS THESE INCLUDE A SYSTEM WIDE FREEZE ON SALARIES FOR NON REPRESENTED STAFF A SYSTEM WIDE FREEZE ON SALARY SCALES FOR NON STUDENT ACADEMIC EMPLOYEES OF OUR TERRY PAY CUT OF 10% OR CURRENT CHANCELLOR SAID THE PRESIDENT. ELIMINATING NONESSENTIAL TRAVEL AND RENEGOTIATING PROFESSIONAL SERVICE AGREEMENTS. SLIDE FIVE SHOWS THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISE PROPOSAL REDUCES THE UNIVERSITY'S BUDGET BY 10% OR THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY TWO MILLION FROM THE NINETEEN TWENTY FUNDING LEVEL. WE BELIEVE THAT REDUCTIONS THE UNIVERSITIES BASED BUDGET COMBINED WITH THE INCREASED COST IN LOST REVENUES THE UNIVERSITY IS EXPERIENCING WILL HAVE NEGATIVE IMPACTS OF OUR ABILITY TO DELIVER INSTRUCTION CONDUCT RESEARCH AND CARE FOR PATIENTS. WE THEREFORE REQUEST THAT YOUHOLD THE UNIVERSITIES BASED BUDGET LIVE FROM THE CURRENT YEAR NINETEEN TWENTY TWO THE BUDGET YEAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE. WE ALSO SEEK YOUR ASSISTANCE IN RECEIVING AS MUCH FEDERAL FUNDING COMING TO CALIFORNIA AS POSSIBLE WE REQUEST THIS BECAUSE THE UNIVERSITY IS GOING TO BE ENROLLING ADDITIONAL STUDENTS THIS FALL. WE ARE COMMITTED TO ENSURING THAT THESE INCOMING CALIFORNIA UNDERGRADUATES RECEIVE THE EDUCATION THEY DESERVE. IN PRIOR RECESSIONS UNIVERSITY RACED REVENUES WHICH HELPS COUNTER LOSSES IN STATE GENERAL FUNDS AND MAINTAIN ACCESS AFFORDABILITY AND QUALITY. BUT IN THIS CORPORATE NINETEEN INDUCED RECESSION WE KNOW THAT MULTIPLE REVENUE SOURCES HAVE BEEN IMPACTED OR NOT I'M NOT AVAILABLE. FOR SUPPORTING OUR STUDENTS STAFF AND FACULTY. EARNERS MAY REVISE ALSO CONTINUES TO MAKE MUCH NEEDED INVESTMENTS IN MEDICAL EDUCATION INCLUDING ELEVEN POINT THREE MILLION FOR THE UC RIVERSIDE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE. UNIVERSITY CONTINUES TO REQUEST TWENTY FIVE MILLION FOR UC RIVERSIDE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE BECAUSE THE SCHOOL IS UNIQUELY POSITIONED TO EXPAND MEDICAL EDUCATION IN A REGION THAT HAS BEEN MEDICALLY UNDER SERVED OR ARE TOO LONG. AND CENTER ROSTER I HAVE BEEN REQUESTED TO READ A BRIEF STATEMENT OR UC HASTINGS COLLEGE OF THE LAW ON THEIR BEHALF IF THAT IS ALL RIGHT THAT'S FINE THANK YOU PLEASE. RATE THIS IS- A FORTY UC HASTINGS COLLEGE OF THE LAW ON BEHALF OF CFO DAVID SEWARD. HE THINKS COLLEGE OF THE LAW FOUNDED IN EIGHTEEN TWENTY EIGHT SORRY. I MISSPOKE ISN'T COLLEGE OF THE LAW AND IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT IT'S A STRONG AND RESILIENT INSTITUTION DEDICATED TO FULFILLING ITS PUBLIC MISSION THE MAGNITUDE OF. THE SCHOOL CARNAGE COSTS AND TO BE CAUSED BY THE CODE NINETEEN THAN DEMOCRATS IT'S A GOOD STORY PROPORTIONS. IF THINGS VALUES ITS AFFILIATION WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WHILE HASTINGS DOES NOT BENEFIT FROM THE FINANCIAL HEALTH OF OUR COMPATRIOTS IN CALIFORNIA'S SYSTEM OF HIGHER EDUCATION WE WILL PERSEVERE MANAGED THROUGH THESE DIFFICULT TIMES AND LOOK. FORWARD TO BETTER ONCE HATCHED. IT WAS MY BROTHER. THANK YOU WELL BEFORE WE GO TO SEE ISSUE OF THANK YOU FOR THAT THE PRESENTATION I WANT TO COMPLIMENT THE PRESIDENT ON THE QUALITY OF THE FILM A LETTER THAT. DR PAN AND I RECEIVED- DATED MAY TWENTY SECOND TWENTY TWENTY ON THE- ISSUES THAT THE SYSTEM UC SYSTEM IS FACING. OBVIOUSLY WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO. FIND MORE MONEY FOR. OUR HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS IN THE STATE MY SPECIFIC QUESTION THOUGH BEFORE WE GO ON TO. SEE ISSUE AND MY COLLEAGUES- WITH RESPECT TO THE ITEMS RAISED BY THE LA- IN TERMS OF ALTERNATIVES AND SPECIFICALLY. THOSE PERTAINING TO THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE FUNDING AND- THE RESERVE FUNDING- FUNDS MAINTAINED BY YOU SEE. IS THERE SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO DO IN THIS BUDGET ACT TO PROVIDE YOU SEE WITH FLEXIBILITY. WITH REGARD TO THE USE OF DEFERRED MAINTENANCE FUNDS PREVIOUSLY APPROPRIATED AND ALSO YOUR RESERVE FUNDS. BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT SOME STOP GAP OR SHORT OR SHORT RANGE- BACK FILL IS NEEDED. TO TRY TO PRESERVE MORE OF YOUR CORE FUNCTION WE WOULDN'T BUDGET BILLING TO SWEEP THOSE OLD FUNDS AND PROVIDE THEM TO US AS UNALLOCATED FUNDS BECAUSE THE UNIVERSITY IS REQUIRED TO SPEND. ONE TIME FUNDS ON THE PURPOSE SPECIFIED IN THE BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE SO WE'RE NOT ABLE TO SWEEP THOSE LEGALLY AND SPEND TIME ON SOMETHING ELSE- IF WE DON'T HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO DO SO. I WILL NOTE THAT. AND WE DID NOT GET THIS INFORMATION TO THE LA- SO I APOLOGIZE TO THE ANALYST- WE SURVEYED OUR CAMPUSES AS TO HOW MANY OF THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE FUNDS WERE ALREADY COMMITTED THROUGH CONTRACTS AND THERE ACTUALLY IS ABOUT TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS AT THIS POINT. THAT IS FULLY- UNCOMMITTED SO NOT THE FOUR HUNDRED MILLION THE REST OF IT DOES HAVE CONTRACTS ATTACHED TO IT- IN TERMS OF THE EAGLES TWENTY FIVE MILLION IS UNCOMMITTED. AND SEVENTY TWENTY BY TWENTY FIVE MILLION AT THIS POINT DOES NOT HAVE A CONTRACT THAT HAS BEEN SIGNED BY THE UNIVERSITY. OF THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE FUNDS THAT WE RECEIVED. IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE LA- REPORT REFLECTS MAYBE I'M MISREADING IT. TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN MILLION FOR UC. THE LARGEST SINGLE COMPONENT OF THIS WAS FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROJECTS I SEE SO IT'S TWO EIGHTEEN TOTAL AND THEN SOME PORTION OF THAT WAS DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND YOU ARE SUGGESTING THAT THAT WAS A HUNDRED MILLION. YES THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE FUNDING THAT IS AVAILABLE TO BE SWEPT US LESS I THANK THEM AS IN THE LA- REPORT. WILL WORK WITH YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF TO GET AN ACCURATE NUMBER. FOR THEM BUT I WANTED TO MAKE NOTE OF THAT- OF THE APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR ALLOCATIONS THERE'S ONLY ABOUT TWENTY FIVE IT CURRENTLY. DOES NOT HAVE A CONTRACT ATTACHED TO IT OKAY. WELL I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE WE I ASKED THE QUESTION BECAUSE WE CERTAINLY WANT TO PROVIDE. BOTH UC AND C. ISSUE THE FLEXIBILITY TO USE MONEY PREVIOUSLY APPROPRIATED IF THE INSTITUTIONS TO. DETERMINE THAT THERE IS A MORE APPROPRIATE. CORE FUNCTION RELATED USE- SO WE'LL WORK ON THAT. THANK YOU MA'AM. CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY SEE IF YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON SENATOR SO THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO PROVIDE. C. ISSUES COMMENTS ON THIS ISSUE OUTLOOK AND THE REVISION I'LL SPEAK TO A PROPOSED CUT. IN THIS ITEM CAN BE PROPOSED FISCAL FLEXIBILITY. IN WHICH ARMY. HI MY NAME IS RYAN STORM ASSISTANT VICE CHANCELLOR FOR BUDGET ALBANY STATE UNIVERSITY CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. SO AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR THIS ISSUE WAS N STRONG FOOTING- THE CSU'S FOUR YEAR GRADUATION RATE FIRST TIME STUDENTS INCREASED TO TWENTY SEVEN AND A HALF PERCENT. UP FROM NINETEEN POINT 3% SINCE THE LAUNCH DATE OF GRANT MICHIGAN TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. WE GRADUATED TWENTY THOUSAND MORE UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS IN JUST FIVE YEARS AGO. AND WE MADE OUR PROGRESS IN ENSURING THAT OUR FACULTY AND STAFF ARE BEING A FAIR AND COMPETITIVE WAGES. SO WHILE OUR CIRCUMSTANCES HAVE CHANGED IN THE STATE IS NOW IN AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN WE CONTINUE TO BE FOCUSED ON OUR MISSION. AND SERVING OUR STUDENTS AND CALIFORNIA AS BEST AS WE CAN. CERTAINLY WE UNDERSTAND THE SITUATION THAT KOBE NINETEEN HAS USHERED IN THE NEW FISCAL REALITY. ANY VERY UNFORTUNATELY OF A PROLONGED STATE BUDGET CRISIS. SO FIRST- ABOUT MY COMMENTS ABOUT THE PROPOSED CUTS. MR SHIVERS PROPOSAL AS DETAILED AS A THREE HUNDRED NINETY EIGHT MILLION DOLLAR ONGOING BUDGET REDUCTION THAT'S A 10% REDUCTION TO OUR GENERAL FUND APPROPRIATION. FIVE PERSPECTIVE ALL RIGHT THAT IS EQUIVALENT TO TWO TIMES ALL OF THE ON GOING MONEY DEDICATED SINCE TWENTY SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN. TO CSU'S GRADUATION ISSUE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. NOW THIS CANCEL REDUCTION CLEARLY IS FORMIDABLE MOREOVER THE ACTUAL IMPACT TO SEIZE YOUR BUDGET IS MORE SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE WE HAVE CLOSE TO ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OF MORE MANDATORY COSTS AND COMPUTER RELATED COSTS IN THE BUDGET YEAR THAT ARE NOT FUNDED. THEREFORE WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THAT THE LEGISLATURE AND THE ADMINISTRATION MINIMIZE A REDUCTION TO OUR BASE OPERATIONS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. ONE POSSIBLE PATH IS TO ADOPT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S ALTERNATIVE WHICH SWEEPS UNSPENT CURRENT YOUR DOLLARS AND LESSENS THE REDUCTION BY THE SAME AMOUNT IN THE BUDGET YEAR. IN FACT WE RECOMMEND THAT THE ONLY ALTERNATIVE BEADOPTED IN LIEU OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL. IT IS A WASH FROM THE STATE'S FIRST GENERAL FUND PERSPECTIVE TO DO THIS CURRENT YEAR BUDGET CHANGE IT PROVIDES US TEMPORARY RELIEF. IF HE L. A. O.'S ALTERNATE IS ADOPTED IT COULD REDUCE THE BUDGET YOUR CUTS THIS ISSUE BY AS MUCH AS ONE HUNDRED SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS OR CUT WHAT WHAT WOULD BE A REVISED KIND OF TWO HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS INSTEAD. OF THE THREE HUNDRED NINETY. MALENKO I NOW LIKE TO TURN THAT FISCAL FLEXIBILITY ISSUE THAT I MENTIONED EARLIER. WELL THE MAGNITUDE OF THE POTENTIAL CUTS TO THE CSU IS DAUNTING- WE LEARNED FROM THE GREAT RECESSION. AND WE THAT SEES YOU CURRENTLY HAVE A NUMBER OF TOOLS TO BE ABLE TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT ON OUR STUDENTS OR FACULTY OR STAFF. HE SEES YOU AS PRUDENTLY GROW RESERVES TO MEET CERTAIN STRATEGIC GOALS. ONE OF WHICH HAS BEEN PREPARATION FOR POSSIBLE ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY. I THINK YOU SHOULD DRAW UPON THESE RESERVES ALREADY TO MAINTAIN OPERATIONS AND PROGRAMS IMPACTED BY THE COLD IN NINETEEN. AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO. REALLY THE USE OF RESERVES UP WHICH ARE ONE TIME FUNDS CANNOT BE A PERMANENT SOLUTION. BUT THEY ARE A VALUABLE ASSET THAT CAN BE UTILIZED UNTIL SUCH TIME AS OTHER RESOURCES BECOME AVAILABLE. OUR CAMPUSES ALSO HAVE RECEIVED FUNDING FROM FEDERAL CARERS ACT FUNDING WHICH WILL MITIGATE SOME OF THE COSTS AND LOSSES REVENUE LOSSES DUE TO THE NINETEEN. IN APRIL- C. SHIPMENT OF THE HIRING CHILL AND REDUCE NONESSENTIAL TRAVEL BOTH OF WHICH WILL SAVE MANY MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR THE UNIVERSITY. AND WITH THE CSU TOOLS AND MINE WE ASKED THE LOGISTICS PROVIDES YOU MAXIMUM FLEXIBILITY IN BEING ABLE TO OPERATIONALIZE FINAL BUDGET REDUCTION. STOREKEEPER CREDIT REFERENCING B. SIDE SEES YOU TOOLS WELL THERE IS A SINGLE PROPOSED NEW TOOL THAT IS IN YOUR AGENDA TODAY AS OF RIGHT NOW STAFF. DOES NOT RECOMMEND THAT YOU ADOPTED. THAT PROPOSAL IS THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISION PROPOSAL THAT WOULD ALLOW EXCUSE YOU TO USE RESTRICTED C. ISSUE FUNDS ACROSS UNIVERSITY TO ADDRESS A CUTE LITTLE BIT NINETEEN RELATED IMPACTS AND REVENUE LOSSES. WE FULLY SUPPORT THIS PROPOSAL AND REQUEST THAT YOU NOT. WE ARE ALL OVER WE FULLY SUPPORT THIS PROPOSAL I'M REQUESTING YOU ACT NOW AND NOT A DELAY ACTION ON THAT ON THAT PARTICULAR PROPOSAL. WE NEED THE FLEXIBILITY AS WE ENTER THESE TOUGH FINANCIAL TIMES IN THIS PROPOSAL I'M SURE THAT IF NEEDED WE WILL HAVE THE FINAL TOOL NECESSARY TO MAKE SURE WE'RE ABLE TO MITIGATE IMPACTS TO STUDENTS FACULTY AND STAFF. AS WE LOOK TO THE FALL IN THE FUTURE THERE ARE A HANDFUL OF ITEMS FOR YOU TO KEEP IN MIND. FIRST THE CHANCELLOR RECENTLY ANNOUNCED THAT ARE PLANNING. WHICH WILL RESULT IN SUSHI COURSES PRIMARY PRIMARILY BEING DELIVERED VIRTUALLY. ALL TWENTY TWENTY TERM. WITH LIMITED EXCEPTIONS FOR IN PERSON ACTIVITIES THAT CANNOT BE DELIVERED VIRTUALLY. THERE WILL BE HYBRID APPROACHES AND THERE WILL BE A VARIABILITY ACROSS THE TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES. DUE TO SPECIFIC CONTEXTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES. PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERTS PREDICT WAVES OF INFECTION. IN LATE FALL TWENTY TWENTY IN EARLY TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND IF WE WERE TO BEGIN FOR A FACE TO FACE MODALITY WE WOULD LIKELY HAVE TO SWITCH TO A VIRTUAL FORMAT AND THAT WOULD COMPROMISE RIGOROUS STANDARDS. FIFTY AND WELFARE. SECOND AS I NOTED EARLIER THE UNIVERSITY IS MORE THAN JUST ACADEMIC AND STUDENT SUPPORTS INCLUDES STATE SIDE STUDENTS SPORTS LIKE HEALTH CENTERS. ARE HOUSING PARKING AND STUDENT CENTERS. SOME OF THESE PROGRAM AREAS ARE UNCHARACTERISTICALLY INSIGNIFICANT THIS STRESS BECAUSE STUDENTS EMPLOYEES AND THE PUBLIC ARE LARGELY ABSENT FROM OUR CAMPUSES. THESE CHALLENGES COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OTHER AREAS OF THE UNIVERSITY. BUT THAT HAS NOT HAPPENED YET. BUT WE'RE WORKING TO AVOID THAT- AGAIN BUT WE ARE% AWARE THAT IT COULD BE THAT BUT I WANTYOU TO BE AWARE THAT IT. COULD BECOME A SERIOUS CHALLENGE IN THE FUTURE. OUR PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION HAS TO BE A PRIORITY. IN THE STATE NOW AND IN THE FUTURE REMEMBER THEY SEE ISSUE IS THE LARGEST FOUR YEAR PUBLIC UNIVERSITY IN THE COUNTRY. IN HALF OF ALL NEW DEGREES THE STATE NEEDS TO KEEP THIS THING MOVING FORWARD ORIGINALLY OUT OF THE C. ISSUE. DOES YOUR FUTURE TEACHERS YOUR NURSES YOUR SCIENTISTS YOUR AGRICULTURAL EXPERTS SENIOR ENTREPRENEURS. FOURTH AND FINALLY WE WILL CONTINUE TO FULFILL OUR MISSION TO CALIFORNIA WE WILL CONTINUE TO BE A BEACON OF OPPORTUNITY AND SOCIAL MOBILITY IN THE GOOD TIMES AND NOT SO GOOD TIMES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU LET ME ASK ONE QUESTION CAN YOU GIVE ME AN EXAMPLE OF RESTRICTED FUNDS AND THEN THE USE WHAT TYPE OF FUNDS ARE WE TALKING ABOUT. SURE YEAH THERE ARE THERE ARE SEVERAL OF THEM. B. R. MANY YEARS AGO AND THERE WERE A NUMBER OF ITEMS THAT WERE CREATED IN STATE LAW THAT AND THESE ARE STUDENTS SUPPORT SERVICES SO THERE ARE THERE SUCH THINGS AND START TORIES. ARE PARKING THEIR STUDENT UNIONS THERE STUDENT CENTERS- HEALTH CENTERS AND THE WAY THAT IT STRUCTURALLY WORKS IN STATUTE IS ESSENTIALLY ALL. CRAZY BUT IT'S JUST BASICALLY. IF YOU IF YOU COLLECT REVENUES TO SUPPORT A PARTICULAR ACTIVITY YOU HAVE TO USE THAT MONEY ON THOSE THINGS SO FOR EXAMPLE WE COLLECT REVENUES FOR DORMS WHICH REVIEW. YOU CAN ONLY USE THEM FOR DORMER HOUSE STUDENT HOUSING. THESE WHAT WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT- MAYBE NOT IMMEDIATELY- WE'RE STILL ANALYZING ALL OF OUR OPTIONS AND- CASH FLOW ON ART. HISTORY PROGRAMS BY CAMPUS- SO THERE'S A LOT OF YOU KNOW TWENTY THREE TIMES. ALL THE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT MEDICATIONS THAT CAN OCCUR. BUT WE DO ANTICIPATE THAT AT SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE IF CONDITIONS PERSIST THAT WE MAY HAVE TO. YOU REALIZE SOME MONIES THAT MIGHT BE. WE MIGHT HAVE MORE RESERVES SAY MAYBE IN PARKING AND MAYBE SHIPPED IT TO HOUSING TO HELP SUPPORT HOUSING. TEMPORARILY OR IF OR YOU KNOW TWO DIFFERENT FUNDS IN THAT WAY SO THAT'S THAT'S REALLY WHAT THAT FLEXIBILITY IS TRYING TO DO IS JUST HAVE THAT TOOL AT OUR DISPOSAL LIKE I SAID IN MY COMMENTS WE DON'T THINK THAT WE NEED TO UTILIZE IT RIGHT AWAY- BUT WE THINK THAT IF THE PROJECTIONS ARE CORRECT THEY WERE ENOUGH FOR YOUR- REALLY BAD TOUGH. BUDGET SITUATION WE REALLY ANTICIPATE THAT OF ALL OF OUR CAMPUSES ALL THOSE VARIOUS PROGRAMS THAT WE WILL RUN INTO A SITUATION WHERE WE DO NOT HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS- DEFICIENCIES IN THOSE AREAS. THANK YOU BEFORE I TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE SAID. FOR QUESTIONS PERHAPS DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE MAY WANT TO COMMENT ON- THE LAST POINTS ON RESTRICTED FUNDS. OR ANY OF THE OTHER ITEMS SO TOUCHED ON BY THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY REPRESENTATIVES. YEAH CHRIS FERGUSON WHAT. FIRST. OF YOUR GUN. SOUND. YES RIGHT. OKAY. CAN HE SEE US. YEAH. I WISH I COULD READ LIPS. AND EATEN. IN THE TENTH DAY OF THE NIGHT. WITH LIKE A BOSS OF MINE. HELLO YEAH. SORRY IT MUST HAVE BEEN GOOD LOOKS GOOD- WE HEARD AGAIN YOU CERTAINLY CAN SO. I THINK WE'RE YOU KNOW CHRIS FERGUS WITH FINANCE WE'RE CERTAINLY SUPPORTIVE OF THE LANGUAGE THAT WE PUT FORWARD- WITH THE USE OF RESTRICTED FUNDING. TO HELP COLLEGES MITIGATE THE IMPACTS- CODE NINETEEN THEIR SPECIFIC LANGUAGE WITHIN THE YEARS TO RESTRICT FUNDING THAT DIRECTS THE UNIVERSITY'S MCALLISTER FIRST USE THAT FUNDING. TO MITIGATE THE IMPACTS TO OUR UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENT POPULATIONS BOTH IN TERMS OF SERVICES PROVIDED TO THEM AND IN ACCESSING THE UNIVERSITY. AT THE UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES. WERE ALSO OPEN TO A CONVERSATION ON PROVIDING SOME FLEXIBILITY WHEN IT COMES TO. THE USE OF BY- NEED DEFERRED MAINTENANCE FUNDING BALANCES. WHAT WE CERTAINLY DO THAT- YOU KNOW MORE IN LIGHT OF PROVIDING RIGHT OR AT LEAST THE CONVERSATION MORE IN TERMS OF PROVIDING SOME FLEXIBILITY TO THE UNIVERSITIES TO USE EXISTING RESOURCES. AS OPPOSED TO TRENDING PROPOSED REDUCTIONS SO. OPTION FOR ALL GOING IN NATURE. AND WE REMAIN CAN ABOUT THE I'LL HERE IN. FOR THE STATE. CHRIS THE PROBLEM DEALING WITH IS THESE ARE ALL UNCHARTED-WATERS. I THINK YOU'D AGREE WE DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH FEDERAL FUNDING WE'RE GOING TO RECEIVE WE DON'T PROBABLY REALLY KNOW. HOW MUCH REVENUE WE'RE GOING TO RECEIVE AS A STATE SO IT'S SEVEN. IT'S SORT OF A GUESSING GAME BUT YOU'RE DOING A GREAT JOB AND I APPRECIATE THOSE COMMENTS. TELLING ANY QUESTIONS THE LEVEL OF FEDERAL. OKAY THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH FOR THE PRESENTATION LET'S MOVE ON TO OUR FINAL- DISCUSSION ITEM ISSUE ISSUE NUMBER EIGHTY WHICH IS FINANCIAL AID REDUCTIONS. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE.

FIRST DOT YOU SHOULD THE PRIVATE NONPROFIT INSTITUTIONS MEET THEIR SPECIFIED TRANSFER GOALS THE AMOUNT OF THE GRANTS WILL INCREASE AGAIN. I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU VERY MUCH HELLO. YEAH WE WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT UNLESS OFFICE. THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HAS SHARED THE COMPANY'S MARRIAGE AND LARGELY RETAINS FUNDING FOR ONGOING FINANCIAL AID PROGRAM. PRODUCE A PRETTY SPECIFIC PURPOSES THAT ARE COVERED INITIATED HERE JOHN DOT. ONE IS RELATED TO SOME FINANCIALLY YOU SCENES YES YOU AND THE OTHER IS RELATED TO THE KIND AWARD AMOUNT OF PROSTITUTION. THESE PROGRAMS PRIMARILY SUPPORT STUDENTS WITH FINANCIAL NEED. AND AS A GENERAL COMMENT WOULD ENCOURAGE THE LEGISLATURE TO PRIORITIZE NEED BASED FINANCIAL AID PROGRAMS. AS THEY'RE LIKELY MORE ACTIVITY INCREASING COLLEGE ACCESS AND NOT NEED BASED PROGRAMS. THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION ON THIS ISSUE WHAT SHALL SENIOR GENDER. RECOMMENDATION IS REJECT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED REDUCTIONS FOR THESE TWO PURPOSE AS AN INSTRUCTOR FIVE ONE TIME FUNDING TO SUSTAIN THEM JAN TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE. I WOULD CONSIST OF SIX MILLION FOR CSU INFORMALLY INCREASE HEAT TO MAINTAIN SUMMER FINANCIAL AID. AS WELL THE POINT NINE MILLION FOR THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION TO pMAINTAIN THE CURRENT MAXIMUM AWARD AMOUNT A PRIVATE NONPROFIT COLLEGES. THANK GOD WE HAVE TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. ZERO THANK YOU SENATOR ROTH- IN THE NINETEEN TWENTY UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA HAD RECEIVED FOUR MILLION DOLLARS TO PROVIDE SUMMER UP FINANCIAL AID FOR OUR STUDENTS WE UTILIZE THAT BY PROVIDING- ABOUT TWO POINT SIX MILLION OF IT LAST SUMMER AND WE ARE SET TO PROVIDE ANOTHER ONE POINT THREE MILLION FOR THIS COMING SUMMER UP THE FINANCIAL AID WAS PROVIDED TO CAMPUS SAYS BASED ON THE NUMBER OF CALGARY AND RECIPIENTS THOSE CAMPUSES HAVE IN ORDER TO HAVE THE STATE. FUNDED SUMMER AID SHIRT AND A BIT LIKE A CAL GRANT WHERE IT WOULD GO TO OUR NEEDIEST STUDENTS UP FOR MILLION DOLLARS IS ENOUGH TO PAY FOR PORT THAT CONSUMER CREDIT. IT WOULD TAKE. AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU FOR THAT INFORMATION. FIVE SEE IF YOU. YES SENATOR- BRENT BRAINSTORM ONCE AGAIN- SO SIX MILLION DOLLARS WAS PROVIDED TODAY CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY- TO DATE WE HAVE- DEDICATED ABOUT FOUR POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS TO SUMMER TERM FINANCIALLY. I THINK IT MAKES IT MAKES SENSE TO THINK ABOUT THIS PROGRAM IN A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT WAYS THE FIRST IS THAT- WHEN- THIS IS THESE ARE BRAND NEW PROGRAMS AND THEY ARE ITEMS THAT- WHEN IT COMES TO TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IF IT MAKES SENSE TO SUPPORT UNIVERSITY OR NOT DIRECTLY- WE WOULD OBVIOUSLY. SUPPORT OF A IF THERE'S NOT ENOUGH MONEY TO GO AROUND BECAUSE WE ARE IN EXPERIENCING AND- SIGNIFICANCE. IT WOULD MAKE SENSE FOR BUT MOST OF THE FUNDING TOWARDS UNIVERSITY FIRST IN SUPPORTING OPERATIONS SECOND THING THAT MIGHT OCCUR OVER THE LONG TERM AND WE'LL HAVE TO SEE HOW LONG. THIS YES WE WERE RECEPTION GOES BUT- AS TIME GOES ON YOU WILL BE MORE DIFFICULT FOR CAMPUSES. TO OFFER A SUMMER TERM COURSES. IN THE GREAT RECESSION. OUR EXPERIENCE WAS THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE A LOT OF. FLEXIBILITY IN TERMS OF DEALING WITH A LOT OF THAT WHAT WAS AT THAT TIME AND IT'S THIRTY WERE GENERAL FUND BEING REDUCED. AT TIMES. IN AS MANY GAMES SHOULD MEASURE WE- WE- CURTAILED SIGNIFICANTLY ARE OFFERINGS DURING A STATE SUPPORTED SUMMER. KEEP THAT IN MIND GOING FORWARD WHEN YOU'RE WHEN YOU'RE DECIDING WHETHER TO. SUSTAIN THIS PROGRAM OR NOT THAT AS TIME MARCHES ON- WILL OBVIOUSLY BE. WILLING AND ABLE TO PROVIDE THAT FINANCIALLY GETS TO STUDENTS. AS WE'RE ABLE TO OFFER SUMMER TERM. COURSES THANK YOU. I BELIEVE WE HAVE A REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES ONLINE. YES GOOD AFTERNOON THIS IS ALEX GRAVES OF THE ICY CEO- I HAD PROVIDED A COUPLE OF SLIDES THAT- AND HAPPY TO EITHER IS REFERRED TO IN MY COMMENTS OR TO PULL UP ON A SHARE SCREEN WHATEVER THE PLEASURE OF THE COMMITTEE IS HERE. WELL LET'S SEE WHAT WE'RE ABLE TO DO. PUT HIM UP ON THE SCREEN. IF YOU CAN TRY THAT LET'S WORK TO THAT- OKAY THAT LOOKS LIKE IT'S DISABLED FOR ME IT'S ALL ALL- I'LL JUST REFER TO SOME OF THIS IS I WALK THROUGH MY COMMENTS THAT'S FINE THANK YOU. ALEX GREAT WITH. YOU ANYWAY SO THERE YOU GO. WE ARE PERCENT EIGHTY FIVE NONPROFIT COLLEGES UNIVERSITIES IN THE STATE- THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT TODAY I JUST WANT TO BRIEFLY SPEAK ABOUT THE PROPOSED CAL GRANT CUT OF MORE THAN A THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR LOW INCOME STUDENTS WHO ATTEND ONE TO ATTEND OUR INSTITUTIONS- THE STUDENTS HAVE TREMENDOUS NEED AND REDUCING THEIR AWARD UNDERMINES SHARED GOALS FOR INSTITUTIONS THE STATE LEGISLATURE. AROUND HIGHER EDUCATION ACCESS AFFORDABILITY COMPLETION INEQUITY. WE AGREE THAT THE STATE SHOULD BE PRIORITIZING IT SLOWING COME UP UNDER REPRESENTED STUDENTS RIGHT NOW AND LOOKING AT THE MORE THAN TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND KILOGRAMS STUDENTS ATTENDING OUR INSTITUTIONS ARE SOCIO ECONOMICALLY COMPARABLE TO THEIR PEERS ATTENDING A UC OR CSU. AFTER FIRST GENERAL COLLEGE STUDENTS 47% ARE LATINO. AND THE AVERAGE FAMILY INCOME THE STUDENTS IS LESS THAN FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. IF APPROVED THIS CAT WOULD MAKE THE CAL GRANT AWARD WORTH 17% LESS THAN IT WAS IN TWO THOUSAND ONE. OVER THAT SAME TIME PERIOD FOR COMPARISON DEKALB GRANT AWARD LEVEL FOR STUDENTS ATTENDING A CSU WAS INCREASED A HUNDRED NINETY TWO PERCENT. I AM FOR STUDENTS ATTENDING UC IT'S INCREASED AND STATUTE THAT PERMITS THIS CAT. HAS TO DO WITH THE ASSOCIATE DEGREE FOR TRANSFER TARGETS WHICH I'D LIKE TO BRIEFLY SPEAK ABOUT AND MY APPS LIES THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE. A WALK THROUGH THAT. IF YOU LOOK AT THE TIME LINE WHICH IS SLATED TO- YOU'LL SEE THAT THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF WORK DONE IN A RELATIVELY SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME. SINCE THE AGREEMENT WAS REACHED IN THE SUMMER OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN- YOU KNOW A FEW MONTHS LATER THAT FALL WE HAD THIRTY OR INSTITUTIONS YOU'VE GOT ARTICULATED PATHWAYS AND BEGAN ACCEPTING. AT EIGHTY T. APPLICATIONS- JUST A SHORT TIME LATER. AND WHAT WE SEE NOW AS OF THIS PAST FALL. IF WE DON'T HAVE THIRTY NINE INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE PARTICIPATING WITH ARTICULATED PATHWAYS ACROSS ALL THIRTY SIX EIGHTY MAJORS. AND SO THE FACT TODAY IS THAT THE MAJORITY OF EIGHTY PARTICIPATING INSTITUTIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA OR A. I. C. C. O. S. T. SHINS AND KNEES PROVIDE TREMENDOUS REGIONAL ACCESS FOR TRANSFER STUDENTS. ON THE NEXT FLIGHT JUST GIVES YOU A SNAPSHOT. OF OUR PARTICIPATING INSTITUTIONS BROKEN DOWN BY REGION- AND SLIDES FOR GIVES YOU A SENSE OF WHAT ARE CALLED DATA ALL TWENTY NINETEEN EXCUSE ME COLLECTION LOOKS LIKE-BUT I'D LIKE TO TURN TO SLIDE FIVE- WHICH GIVES YOU. THE THREE REPORTING PERIODS AND THE TRENDS WE'VE SEEN- AND I WANT TO SAY YOU KNOW THERE HAVE BEEN CHALLENGES IN IMPLEMENTING THIS PROGRAM THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT. YOU'RE CREATING THESE PATHWAYS IN THE TRAINING AND TIME NEEDED ACROSS MULTIPLE DEPARTMENTS AT THE INSTITUTIONAL LEVEL. FOR STAFF TO IDENTIFY AND COLLECT THIS DATA AS WELL AS INCREASING THE AWARENESS OF THESE PATHWAYS FOR STUDENTS. THE WHAT I THINK YOU'LL SEE THERE IS THERE'S BEEN. A SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN YEAR TWO IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER OF EIGHTY STUDENTS EXPECTED. ARE THE NUMBER OF PARTICIPATING INSTITUTIONS. OUT CERTAINLY. AT THE NUMBER OF PARTICIPATING SO THAT THAT AGAIN ARE ON THESE BUT NOT RECEIVING ANY APPLICANTS HAS GONE DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY- WELL WE'VE SEEN THE NUMBER OF INSTITUTIONS ARE RECEIVING OUTLOOK AND STUBBLE- IN JUST A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME AND YOU KNOW THIS. I WOULD ADD THAT THIS METRIC- IN STATUTE IS ONLY EIGHTY TWO TRANSFER STUDENTS IT'S NOT ACCOUNTING FOR OTHER TRANSFER STUDENTS. THAT ARE COMING TO OUR INSTITUTIONS THROUGH OTHER LOCAL ARTICULATION AGREEMENTS STAR SECTOR REMAINS COMMITTED TO PROMOTING AND GROWING TRANSFER PATHWAYS SUCH AS EACH KEY WHICH YOU CAN PROVIDE SOME REALLY IMPORTANT- TRANSFER PATHWAYS TO BE FINE STUDENTS ARE REALLY UTILIZING. AT THE REGIONAL LEVEL I'M IF YOU LOOK AT THE LAST COUPLE OF SLIDES YOU'LL JUST SEE SOME EXAMPLES OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF INSTITUTIONS AND HOW THOSE TRANSFER PATHWAYS. ARE FUNCTIONING ON THE GROUND. FUNDAMENTALLY YOU KNOW WE BELIEVE THAT THE TRENDS WE SEE IN OUR DATA. SUGGESTS THAT THE PROGRAM IS IMPROVING AND UNDERSCORES OUR SECTORS COMMITTED TO THIS. AND WE THINK THE RIGHT NOW IS EXACTLY THE WRONG TIME TO PULL THE TRIGGER ON CAT MORE TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS TO THE STUDENTS. WE BELIEVE THE BENEFIT OF YOU KNOW EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS IN SAVINGS BUT THIS WILL BE GENERATED BY THIS NOT FIFTY FIVE OR SO BILLION DOLLAR DEFICIT. ARE SIGNIFICANTLY OVERSHADOWED BY THE ADVERSE IMPACTS OF 11% CUT FOR THE STUDENTS- SO IN CLOSING I JUST SAY THAT WE APPRECIATE RECOGNISE THE SITUATION STATE FINDS ITSELF AND- RESPECTFULLY BELIEVE THAT THIS CATCH NOT BE IMPLEMENTED THIS YEAR- AND WE URGE YOU TO BE REJECTED. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS I JUST HAVE A COUPLE COMMENTS AND THEN I'LL TURN IT OVER TO MICHAEL ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE AND I'LL- TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUES I MEAN I. I HAVE TO SAY THAT GIVEN THE STRUCTURAL AND OTHER DIFFERENCES. BETWEEN THE NONPROFIT. PIRATE COMMUNITY AND OUR CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY AND UC I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY WE USE THE SAME PROGRAM AND APPLY THE SAME STANDARDS FOR INDEPENDENT COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES THAT WE USE FOR THE UC IN THE UC SYSTEM I MEAN THIS THIS CONCEPT OF ASSOCIATE DEGREE FOR TRANSFER AT STANDARD. BUT IT. THE CARD IS. TO HAVE A SYSTEM TO SYSTEM APPLICATION AS OPPOSED TO A SYSTEM TO AN INDIVIDUAL COLLEGE UNIVERSITY I WOULD SEEM TO ME IT WOULD BE VERY VERY DIFFICULT. TO IMPLEMENT THIS EFFECTIVELY ACROSS THE SECTOR WHEN YOU HAVE A SYSTEM IN THIS CASE THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM. NEGOTIATING AND DEALING DIRECTLY WITH INDIVIDUAL COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. AND WHEN THE STANDARD THAT WE APPLY FOR THE BUDGET PURPOSES. IS A SECTOR WIDE STANDARD IT'S ESSENTIALLY AN AVERAGE. I DON'T SEE WHY ANY PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY WOULD HAVE AN INCENTIVE TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF TRANSFER STUDENTS. AND CONVERSELY HOW THAT INDIVIDUAL COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY WHO IS INTERESTED IN DOING SO. COULD POSSIBLY IMPACT THE RESULT. TO PROVIDE FOR AN INCREASE IN CAL GRANTS SO YOU KNOW I THINK WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO TAKE A LOOK AT THIS- AND IF THE GOAL IS TO HAVE MORE COMMUNITY COLLEGE TRANSFER STUDENTS WHO ATTENDED- THESE NONPROFIT INSTITUTIONS IN ORDER TO GET THE HIGHER TELL GRANT WARD. I THINK WE HAVE TO DISCUSS. THE STANDARD THEY WERE APPLYING IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE BECAUSE THE SAME STANDARD THAT WE APPLY TO SEE ISSUE AND YOU SEE. IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT STANDARD TO APPLY I THINK NOT BEING A EDUCATOR. IN THIS NON FOOD WORLD BUT LET ME- MISS GRACE LET ME QUESTION DO WE- DO WE HAVE A LOT. TO MANY COMMUNITY CUP TRANSFER STUDENTS BUT IN THE PROPERTY. AND UNIVERSITY WHAT. TO WHAT OMING IN THEN IT SAYS. THREE YES HE'D PREFER TO. BURNING ELSE. YEAH THANK THANKS FOR THE CALL THAT IN THE COMMENTS YES THERE'S A FEW DIFFERENT DATA SOURCES THAT YOU YOU COULD LOOK AT- THERE'S A COMMUNITY COLLEGE DATA MART- THERE'S ALSO THE NATIONAL STUDENT CLEARINGHOUSE THEN WE ALSO. THE ICC YOU DO AN ANNUAL SURVEY. SO THERE'S SOME VARIATION DEPENDING WHICH NUMBER YOU LOOK AT THAT BUT WE WOULD SAY THERE IS THERE SOMEWHERE IN THE RANGE OF ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE SEVENTY SIX HUNDRED- NEW TRANSFER STUDENTS- ENROLLING AT EACH YEAR. ONE HUNDRED ASIAN WHICH WHICH WAY YOU'RE MEASURING AND WHICH DATA SORCERY I WOULD SUGGEST THAT IF THE GOAL IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A PATHWAY FROM COMMUNITY COLLEGE. TO THESE NON FOR COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES AND THAT IN FACT THEY'RE TAKING. A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF TRANSFER STUDENTS I THINK WE OUGHT TO AT LEAST START COLLECTING THE RAW DATA SO WE HAVE SOME DEFINITE DATA POINT AS TO HOW MANY. COMMUNITY COLLEGE TRANSFER STUDENTS ARE ACCEPTED EACH YEAR. A SECTOR WIDE AND BY INDIVIDUAL COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY AND IF. IF AS A MATTER OF STATE PUBLIC POLICY WE WANT TO REWARD THOSE WHO TAKE THOSE TRANSFER STUDENTS AND- DISINCENTIVE EYES THOSE WHO WERE REFUSING TO DO SO THEN MAYBE WE CAN TAKE A LOOK AT. OUR CAL GRANTS SYSTEM AND SEE IF THERE'S SOME WAY WE CAN DESIGN IT TO DO THAT BUT- THE CURRENT SYSTEM. THIS SEEMS LIKE A HAM FISTED WAY TO DEAL WITH THE SITUATION TO ME BUT ANYWAY. COMMENTS EXACTLY JOHN THIS. ISSUE EIGHTY OF OUR PRESENTERS SEVERAL. SEEING NONE THAT CONCLUDES THE DISCUSSION ITEMS IN PART BE.
