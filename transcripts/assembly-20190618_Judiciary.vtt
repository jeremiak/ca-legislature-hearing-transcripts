AS I TESTIFIED BEFORE.

00:36:13.504 --> 00:36:15.106
I CAME OUT AS A LESBIAN IN MY

00:36:15.172 --> 00:36:16.807
EARLY TWENTIES AFTER QUESTIONING

00:36:16.874 --> 00:36:20.011
MY SEXUALITY FOR SEVERAL YEARS.

00:36:20.077 --> 00:36:21.746

00:36:22.914 --> 00:36:24.482
SHIFT IN MY SEXUALITY AND

00:36:24.549 --> 00:36:26.517
MARRIED A MAN.

00:36:26.584 --> 00:36:29.387
SOME YEARS AFTER COMING OUT.

00:36:29.453 --> 00:36:30.454
AS A LESBIAN I ATTENDED A

00:36:30.521 --> 00:36:32.356
PRESBYTERIAN SEMINARY OPENLY

00:36:32.423 --> 00:36:33.891
LESBIAN AND BECAME PART OF THE

ORDAINED ELDER IN MY CHURCH AND

00:36:41.232 --> 00:36:42.533
I RECALL?

00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:44.101
THE PAINFUL HUMILIATION I

00:36:44.168 --> 00:36:45.703
EXPERIENCE WHEN I WAS ASKED TO

00:36:45.770 --> 00:36:47.738
RESIGN THAT POSITION BECAUSE OF

00:36:47.805 --> 00:36:49.607
MY ORIENTATION.

00:36:49.674 --> 00:36:52.076
SO LIKE MANY IN THIS ROOM.

00:36:52.143 --> 00:36:54.111
I'VE HAD EXPERIENCES OF SIDEWAYS

00:36:54.178 --> 00:36:56.147
GLANCES A HUMILIATING COMMENTS

00:36:56.213 --> 00:36:58.316
EVEN THOUGH RIGHT NOW MOST OF

00:36:58.382 --> 00:36:59.450
YOU CANNOT IMAGINE THAT IN MY

00:36:59.517 --> 00:37:00.918
LIFE.

00:37:00.985 --> 00:37:02.353
BECAUSE OF MY EXPERIENCES IN

00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:03.888
THOSE OF DEAR FRIENDS I REGARD

00:37:03.955 --> 00:37:05.423
THIS RESOLUTION WITH GREAT

00:37:05.489 --> 00:37:06.657
CONCERN.

00:37:06.724 --> 00:37:08.626
MUCH RESONATES.

00:37:08.693 --> 00:37:10.561
BECAUSE OF MY PAST I SEEK TO

00:37:10.628 --> 00:37:11.596
GUIDE CHRISTIANS INTO

00:37:11.662 --> 00:37:13.097
UNDERSTANDING HONOR AND

00:37:13.164 --> 00:37:16.033
COMPASSION FOR LGBT PEOPLE.

00:37:16.100 --> 00:37:17.368
NEVER THE LESS.

00:37:17.435 --> 00:37:19.070
I TAKE EXCEPTION TO THE BELIEF

00:37:19.136 --> 00:37:21.005
THAT RELIGION IS CENTRAL TO THE

00:37:21.072 --> 00:37:23.074
HIGH RATES OF SUICIDE AMONG LGBT

00:37:23.140 --> 00:37:26.210
YOUTH. FOR ME AND MANY OTHERS

00:37:26.277 --> 00:37:29.013
FAITH RESCUED US FROM SUICIDE.

00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:30.715
THE EXPERIENCE OF DISCOVERING

00:37:30.781 --> 00:37:32.083
YOUR DIFFERENT THAN MOST OTHER

00:37:32.149 --> 00:37:34.652
PEOPLE IS DRAMATIC AND TROUBLING

00:37:34.719 --> 00:37:36.153
WHETHER YOU HAVE FAITH OR NOT.

00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:38.956
HOPELESSNESS CAUSES SUICIDE.

00:37:39.023 --> 00:37:40.725
AND AS I STATED LAST YEAR TO

00:37:40.791 --> 00:37:41.959
REMIND THE ASSEMBLY THAT THE

00:37:42.026 --> 00:37:44.462
LESBIAN EXPERIENCE IS MULTI

00:37:44.528 --> 00:37:44.729
FACETED.

00:37:44.795 --> 00:37:47.198
THIS RESOLUTION OVERSIMPLIFIES

00:37:47.264 --> 00:37:48.899
THE FEMALE EXPERIENCE.

00:37:48.966 --> 00:37:50.401
NOT ALL WOMEN WHO IDENTIFY AS

00:37:50.468 --> 00:37:51.602
LESBIAN WILL CLAIM THEY WERE

00:37:51.669 --> 00:37:53.004
BORN THAT WAY.

00:37:53.070 --> 00:37:54.271
AND MOST STUDIES ABOUT

00:37:54.338 --> 00:37:56.974
ORIENTATION HAVE FOCUSED ON MEN.

00:37:57.041 --> 00:37:58.275
MANY WOMEN WILL EXPERIENCE

00:37:58.342 --> 00:38:00.678
SEXUAL FLUIDITY EITHER TOWARD OR

00:38:00.745 --> 00:38:02.179
AWAY LESBIANISM DURING THEIR

00:38:02.246 --> 00:38:05.149
LIVES AS THE APA CONCEDES.

00:38:05.216 --> 00:38:06.951
SOME WOMEN ACKNOWLEDGE THE ROLE

00:38:07.018 --> 00:38:08.653
OF SEXUAL ABUSE BY MEN IN THEIR

00:38:08.719 --> 00:38:09.920

00:38:23.934 --> 00:38:25.369
IN THE SAME WAY THEY HAVE A

00:38:25.436 --> 00:38:26.671
RIGHT TO ABORTION.

00:38:26.737 --> 00:38:27.872
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SHOULD

00:38:27.938 --> 00:38:30.174
NOT BE DICTATING CHOICES ABOUT

00:38:30.241 --> 00:38:31.942

00:39:18.022 --> 00:39:21.625
NOT HOW I STARTED OUT LIFE I A

NEVER EXPERIENCE ANY OPPOSITE

00:39:23.427 --> 00:39:24.662

00:39:30.501 --> 00:39:32.369
THE FIRST. ONE OF MY MY BIGGEST

00:39:32.436 --> 00:39:33.871
MEMORIES AS A CHILD I WAS

00:39:33.938 --> 00:39:36.006
PROBABLY NINE OR TEN YEARS OLD I

00:39:36.073 --> 00:39:37.408
WAS FOLLOWING SOME OTHER BOYS

00:39:37.475 --> 00:39:40.544
OUT TO A FIELD -- ONE OF THE

00:39:40.611 --> 00:39:42.346
BOYS OPEN UP A BIT BOX PULLED

00:39:42.413 --> 00:39:44.749

00:39:44.815 --> 00:39:46.083
TO US.

00:39:46.150 --> 00:39:48.319
AND NO ONE HAD EVER TALKED TO

00:39:48.385 --> 00:39:49.553
TALK TO ME ABOUT HOMOSEXUALITY

00:39:49.620 --> 00:39:52.022
AT THAT POINT THIS IS NINETEEN

00:39:52.089 --> 00:39:53.557
EIGHTY ONE OR SO.

00:39:53.624 --> 00:39:55.126
NO ONE TO TALK TO ME ABOUT ****.

00:39:55.192 --> 00:39:57.895
BUT MY CONSCIENCE WAS DEEPLY

00:39:57.962 --> 00:40:00.831
VIOLATED IN WHAT I SAW.

00:40:00.898 --> 00:40:02.166
NOW OTHER PEOPLE MIGHT HAVE A

00:40:02.233 --> 00:40:04.502
DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE THAN WHAT I

00:40:04.568 --> 00:40:04.835
DID.

00:40:04.902 --> 00:40:07.037
BUT FOR ME WHAT I WITNESSED WAS

00:40:07.104 --> 00:40:09.206
NOT ACCEPTABLE.

00:40:09.273 --> 00:40:10.708
MY CONSCIENCE SAID THIS IS NOT

00:40:10.775 --> 00:40:12.576
OKAY.

00:40:12.643 --> 00:40:13.210
AND YOU SHOULDN'T BE LOOKING AT

00:40:13.277 --> 00:40:15.913
THIS.

00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:16.580
AND WHAT CONCERNS ME ABOUT THIS

00:40:16.647 --> 00:40:17.548
RESOLUTION.

00:40:17.615 --> 00:40:19.116
IS IT SYSTEMATICALLY GOES

00:40:19.183 --> 00:40:20.951
THROUGH AND AND DISCREDITS ANY

00:40:21.018 --> 00:40:23.988
VIEWPOINT OTHER THAN A FIRMING

00:40:24.054 --> 00:40:25.623
OF MOVING IN A HOMOSEXUAL

00:40:25.689 --> 00:40:27.057
DIRECTION.

00:40:27.124 --> 00:40:28.359
SO FOR ANYONE THAT'S EXPERIENCE

00:40:28.425 --> 00:40:31.095
ANY ANY MOMENT THIS IS THE WAY I

00:40:31.162 --> 00:40:32.263
READ IT ANY MOMENTS OF SAME SEX

00:40:32.329 --> 00:40:34.932
ATTRACTION OR MAYBE TRANSGENDER

00:40:34.999 --> 00:40:35.566
FEELINGS ARE LIKE THAT ANYTHING

00:40:35.633 --> 00:40:36.467
LIKE THAT.

00:40:36.534 --> 00:40:38.035
YOU MUST DEFERMENT AND GO THAT

00:40:38.102 --> 00:40:39.970
DIRECTION WELL MY LITTLE

00:40:40.037 --> 00:40:41.906
CONSCIENCE AS A NINE OR TEN YEAR

00:40:41.972 --> 00:40:42.873
OLD BOY.

00:40:42.940 --> 00:40:44.241
DID NOT ALLOW ME TO GO THAT

00:40:44.308 --> 00:40:46.343
DIRECTION.

00:40:46.410 --> 00:40:48.078
AND NOR DID MY CONSCIENCE EVER

00:40:48.145 --> 00:40:50.281
ALLOW ME TO GO THAT DIRECTION.

00:40:50.347 --> 00:40:51.615
AND THAT'S OUR CONSCIENCES WELL

00:40:51.682 --> 00:40:53.417

00:40:53.484 --> 00:40:54.685

THAT FIRES OFF.

00:40:57.087 --> 00:40:58.055
AT WILL.

00:40:58.122 --> 00:40:59.757
I DON'T DETERMINE WHAT I

00:40:59.824 --> 00:41:03.194
ACTUALLY BELIEVE DEEP INSIDE.

00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:05.129
I CAN OBEY MY CONSCIENCE OR NOT.

00:41:05.196 --> 00:41:07.665
AND SO WHAT SCARY FOR ME IS THAT

00:41:07.731 --> 00:41:08.232
TWO HUNDRED PLUS YEARS INTO

00:41:08.299 --> 00:41:09.066

ABOUT THIS NOT NOT TO ANY BODIES

00:44:44.715 --> 00:44:45.949
FAULTS BUT JUST.

00:44:46.016 --> 00:44:47.484

00:44:47.551 --> 00:44:50.320
ISSUES -- SO THIS IS KIND OF OUR

00:44:50.387 --> 00:44:51.622
THE FIRST TIME WE'VE BEEN ABLE

00:44:51.688 --> 00:44:55.626

00:45:00.431 --> 00:45:02.332
IT'S IMPORTANT AS MR MANILA

00:45:02.399 --> 00:45:05.302

00:45:05.369 --> 00:45:05.803
DIALOGUE DOES CONTINUE.

00:45:05.869 --> 00:45:08.205
I THINK SOME OF THE THE CONCERNS

00:45:08.272 --> 00:45:09.840
THAT I HAVE WITH THE RESOLUTION

00:45:09.907 --> 00:45:11.508
AS IT IS RIGHT NOW IS IT IT

00:45:11.575 --> 00:45:14.011
SEEMS. TO ME TO LUMP.

00:45:14.078 --> 00:45:17.681
ALL PRACTICES INTO A DAMAGING

00:45:17.748 --> 00:45:22.686
CONVERSION THERAPY -- YELLOW.

00:45:22.753 --> 00:45:24.922
BAND IF YOU WILL -- AND I DON'T

00:45:24.988 --> 00:45:26.690
THINK THAT ALL PRACTICES ARE YOU

00:45:26.757 --> 00:45:27.791
KNOW AND I THINK THAT THERE ARE

00:45:27.858 --> 00:45:29.259
LEGITIMATE PRACTICES OF FAITH

00:45:29.326 --> 00:45:31.061
AND I THINK YOU I THINK YOU SEE

00:45:31.128 --> 00:45:33.263
THAT -- TOO THAT THE THAT THERE

00:45:33.330 --> 00:45:34.832
ARE LEGITIMATE PRACTICES OF

00:45:34.898 --> 00:45:37.201
FAITH -- THAT ARE DONE IN A

00:45:37.267 --> 00:45:40.704
LOVING AND COMPASSIONATE -- WAY --

00:45:40.771 --> 00:45:42.806
AND YOU KNOW WE DO NEED TO

00:45:42.873 --> 00:45:45.642
RESPECT RELIGIOUS FREEDOM AND I

00:45:45.709 --> 00:45:47.077
DON'T SEE.

00:45:47.144 --> 00:45:47.911
YOU KNOW A FIRM STATEMENT OF

00:45:47.978 --> 00:45:49.246
THAT IN THIS RESOLUTION THAT HEY

00:45:49.313 --> 00:45:50.914
PEOPLE ARE YOU KNOW FREE TO

00:45:50.981 --> 00:45:53.050
PRACTICE THEIR FAITH AS THEY

00:45:53.117 --> 00:45:55.285
BELIEVE AND AND THAT GOES TO

00:45:55.352 --> 00:45:57.321
PEOPLE FROM ALL DIFFERENT WALKS

00:45:57.387 --> 00:46:00.257
OF OF LIFE -- I THINK THE OTHER

00:46:00.324 --> 00:46:03.026
CONCERN THAT I HAVE IS JUST --

00:46:03.093 --> 00:46:04.228
ANY TIME THAT WE AS A GOVERNMENT

00:46:04.294 --> 00:46:06.730
ARE SORT OF TELLING.

00:46:06.797 --> 00:46:07.798
FAITH LEADERS ARE TELLING A

00:46:07.865 --> 00:46:09.133
CHURCH.

00:46:09.199 --> 00:46:10.167
YOU KNOW HOW THEY SHOULD

00:46:10.234 --> 00:46:11.735
OPERATOR HOW THEY SHOULD GO

00:46:11.802 --> 00:46:13.270
ABOUT PRACTICING THEIR FAITH.

00:46:13.337 --> 00:46:14.138
YOU KNOW WE IN THE JUDICIARY

00:46:14.204 --> 00:46:15.339
COMMITTEE OBVIOUSLY OUT TO BE

00:46:15.405 --> 00:46:16.840
PRETTY CONCERNED.

00:46:16.907 --> 00:46:17.407
ABOUT PROTECTING THE FIRST

00:46:17.474 --> 00:46:18.809
AMENDMENT THAT YOU KNOW THAT THE

00:46:18.876 --> 00:46:21.345
FREE EXERCISE OF RELIGION SHOULD

00:46:21.411 --> 00:46:23.914
NOT BE ABRIDGED -- AND EVEN A

00:46:23.981 --> 00:46:25.516
EVEN IF EVEN IN A BUT NINE WAY

00:46:25.582 --> 00:46:26.884
AS THIS I THINK THIS.

00:46:26.950 --> 00:46:28.652
WE CAN ALL AGREE ON TREATING

00:46:28.719 --> 00:46:29.953
PEOPLE EQUITABLY WANT TO MAKE

00:46:30.020 --> 00:46:32.222
SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE ARE TREATED

00:46:32.289 --> 00:46:34.158
ACTED WITH THE PEOPLE ARE FIRMS.

00:46:34.224 --> 00:46:35.692
THAT PEOPLE ARE UP LIFTED --

00:46:35.759 --> 00:46:37.127
THAT PEOPLE APPROACH THINGS FROM

00:46:37.194 --> 00:46:38.362
OF A PLACE OF LOVE AND

00:46:38.428 --> 00:46:40.864
COMPASSION -- EVEN THOUGH I

00:46:40.931 --> 00:46:45.035
MIGHT AGREE ABOUT THAT I THINK

00:46:45.102 --> 00:46:46.770
IT'S TROUBLING WHEN WE START.

00:46:46.837 --> 00:46:47.571
WE AT LEAST HAVE.

00:46:47.638 --> 00:46:48.338
TO I THINK SHOULD BE CONCERNED

00:46:48.405 --> 00:46:48.906
IMPOSSIBLE BUT WHEN WE AS A

00:46:48.972 --> 00:46:51.508
GOVERNMENT BODY ARE STARTING.

00:46:51.575 --> 00:46:53.377
TO MAKE ADMONITIONS TO CHURCHES

00:46:53.443 --> 00:46:56.880
AND RELIGIOUS AND AND AND THE

00:46:56.947 --> 00:46:58.515
PASTORS CLERICS.

00:46:58.582 --> 00:47:00.918
RELIGIOUS LEADERS IF YOU WILL --

00:47:00.984 --> 00:47:02.753
BECAUSE I THINK WE HAVE THAT IS

00:47:02.819 --> 00:47:04.321
A SLIPPERY SLOPE LIKE HOW FAR DO

00:47:04.388 --> 00:47:06.523
WE TAKE THAT TO WE START AS A

00:47:06.590 --> 00:47:08.192

00:47:08.258 --> 00:47:09.726
ADMONISH TEEN OR TELLING IN

00:47:09.793 --> 00:47:11.795
FAITH LEADERS WHAT TO DO OR HOW

00:47:11.862 --> 00:47:13.597
THEY SHOULD PRACTICE THEIR FAITH --

00:47:13.664 --> 00:47:14.598

00:51:38.495 --> 00:51:39.830
IN ADDRESSING THE STIGMA OFTEN

00:51:39.896 --> 00:51:40.931

00:51:40.997 --> 00:51:43.567
IDENTIFIES LGBT Q.. TO MODEL

00:51:43.633 --> 00:51:45.035
EQUITABLE TREATMENT OF ALL

00:51:45.101 --> 00:51:47.103
PEOPLE AGAIN A PRETTY SIMPLE I

00:51:47.170 --> 00:51:48.738
THINK BASIC.

00:51:48.805 --> 00:51:50.941
KIND -- COMING FROM A KIND

00:51:51.007 --> 00:51:52.375
LOVING PLACE THAT WROTE THAT

00:51:52.442 --> 00:51:56.513
RELIGION COMES FROM -- TO SO.

00:51:56.580 --> 00:51:59.115
YOU KNOW I THINK THAT THIS IS --

00:51:59.182 --> 00:52:00.951
CONSISTENT WITH THE VALUES OF

00:52:01.017 --> 00:52:02.352
THE LEGISLATURE THESE CONSISTENT

00:52:02.419 --> 00:52:03.553
WITH THE VALUES OF THE PEOPLE OF

00:52:03.620 --> 00:52:06.623
CALIFORNIA -- I'M CERTAINLY

00:52:06.690 --> 00:52:08.425
HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS TODAY --

00:52:08.492 --> 00:52:09.726
AND I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR

00:52:09.793 --> 00:52:11.161
FOR BRINGING IT I THINK THIS IS

00:52:11.228 --> 00:52:14.130
SOMETHING THAT'S IMPORTANT -- TO

00:52:14.197 --> 00:52:15.499
REFLECT THAT.

00:52:15.565 --> 00:52:17.367
WHERE PEOPLE COME FROM ON THIS

00:52:17.434 --> 00:52:18.502
SHOULD BE COMING FROM A PLACE OF

00:52:18.568 --> 00:52:20.070
COMPASSION SHOULD BE COMING FROM

00:52:20.136 --> 00:52:21.838
A PLACE OF LOVE AND RESPECT TO

00:52:21.905 --> 00:52:24.541
WHOEVER'S COMING BEFORE -- WE'RE

00:52:24.608 --> 00:52:25.942
ALL EQUAL CITIZENS IN THE STATE.

00:52:26.009 --> 00:52:27.110
I'M REGARDLESS OF SEXUAL

00:52:27.177 --> 00:52:29.746
ORIENTATION -- AND SO I THINK

00:52:29.813 --> 00:52:32.115
THIS IS IMPORTANT I'M GLAD THAT

00:52:32.182 --> 00:52:32.682
YOU BROUGHT THIS AND I THINK

00:52:32.749 --> 00:52:33.517
THAT.

00:52:33.583 --> 00:52:34.518
IF YOU LOOK AT THE ACTUAL

00:52:34.584 --> 00:52:36.853
LANGUAGE NOT WHAT MAY MAY BE.

00:52:36.920 --> 00:52:38.388
OTHER INTERPRETATIONS OF IT

00:52:38.455 --> 00:52:39.289
SOMEHOW THAT I'VE GOTTEN OUT IN

00:52:39.356 --> 00:52:40.524
THE MEDIA OR OTHERWISE IF YOU

00:52:40.590 --> 00:52:42.092
LOOK AT WHAT THIS SAYS IT

00:52:42.158 --> 00:52:43.760
ESSENTIALLY SAYS TREAT PEOPLE

00:52:43.827 --> 00:52:45.428
WITH COMPASSION.

00:52:45.495 --> 00:52:46.696
THAT'S REALLY WHAT THIS.

00:52:46.763 --> 00:52:47.597
IF YOU SOME THE SEPT TREAT

00:52:47.664 --> 00:52:48.765
PEOPLE WITH COMPASSION THAT'S

00:52:48.832 --> 00:52:50.667
SOMETHING -- I THINK THAT THIS

00:52:50.734 --> 00:52:51.968
LEGISLATURE SHOULD STRONGLY

00:52:52.035 --> 00:52:54.471
STAND FOR SO VERY HAPPY SUPPORT

00:52:54.538 --> 00:52:57.207
THIS TODAY.

00:52:57.274 --> 00:52:58.875
THANK YOU THIS FEATURE NORRIS.

00:52:58.942 --> 00:53:00.677
I JUST WANTED TO ADDRESSING ONE

00:53:00.744 --> 00:53:02.178
OF THE COMMENTS THAT YOU MADE --

00:53:02.245 --> 00:53:04.014
IN YOUR REMARKS.

00:53:04.080 --> 00:53:05.348
YOU SAID THAT THAT.

00:53:05.415 --> 00:53:06.917
NONE OF US IS THAT WE HAVE NO

00:53:06.983 --> 00:53:08.385
RIGHT TO PRESUPPOSE PEOPLE'S

00:53:08.451 --> 00:53:10.053
CONSCIENCE.

00:53:10.120 --> 00:53:10.620
AND I THINK THAT THAT'S A

00:53:10.687 --> 00:53:12.956
SENTIMENT THAT WE WERE ALL WHOLE

00:53:13.023 --> 00:53:15.825
HEARTEDLY AGREE WITH AND I THINK

00:53:15.892 --> 00:53:17.093
THAT IS VERY MUCH.

00:53:17.160 --> 00:53:20.597
WHAT THIS RESOLUTION IS SAYING?

00:53:20.664 --> 00:53:21.498
SO I'VE GOT I'VE GOT TWO

00:53:21.565 --> 00:53:23.199
CHILDREN THEY ARE TEN AND TWELVE

00:53:23.266 --> 00:53:24.501
YEARS OLD.

00:53:24.568 --> 00:53:27.671
WHAT EVER THEIR PATH WHATEVER

00:53:27.737 --> 00:53:29.239
THEIR AFFILIATION?

00:53:29.306 --> 00:53:29.739
YEAH.

00:53:29.806 --> 00:53:32.309
HOWEVER THEY GO THROUGH IN OF

00:53:32.375 --> 00:53:35.478
THEIR IN THEIR PATH TO ADULTHOOD.

00:53:35.545 --> 00:53:36.813
I DON'T WANT.

00:53:36.880 --> 00:53:40.116
ANYONE OF FAITH LEADER.

00:53:40.183 --> 00:53:41.751
COMMUNITY LATER I DON'T ANYONE.

00:53:41.818 --> 00:53:43.653
JUDGING NOT.

00:53:43.720 --> 00:53:47.891
OR RELATING TO THAT AS A PROBLEM

00:53:47.958 --> 00:53:49.326
THAT NEEDS TO BE CHANGED OR

00:53:49.392 --> 00:53:50.627
SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE

00:53:50.694 --> 00:53:51.795
CONVERTED.

00:53:51.861 --> 00:53:54.331
SO AS A MOTHER I AM VERY VERY

00:53:54.397 --> 00:53:55.432
HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS RESOLUTION

00:53:55.498 --> 00:53:57.801
AND AS A LEGISLATOR I'M VERY

00:53:57.867 --> 00:54:00.804

THANK YOU NO ONE ELSE.

00:54:02.939 --> 00:54:04.908

THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF FOR THAT

00:54:07.911 --> 00:54:09.179
FOR THE COMMENTS AS WELL --

00:54:09.245 --> 00:54:11.548
FIRST OUT ONE TWO I THANK OF

00:54:11.615 --> 00:54:13.583
KEVIN I KNOW OF FOR HIS

00:54:13.650 --> 00:54:15.685
ENGAGEMENT ON THIS ISSUE WHAT

00:54:15.752 --> 00:54:17.621
YOU HAVE BEFORE US HERE IT WAS

00:54:17.687 --> 00:54:18.221
IS NOT.

00:54:18.288 --> 00:54:19.889
THAT THE PRODUCT YOU HAVE BEFORE

00:54:19.956 --> 00:54:21.424
YOU IS NOT.

00:54:21.491 --> 00:54:23.727
A DOES NOT COME EASILY -- THERE

00:54:23.793 --> 00:54:25.195
WERE MANY OF CONVERSATIONS A

00:54:25.261 --> 00:54:26.663
MANY MANY CONVERSE VERY

00:54:26.730 --> 00:54:29.299
DIFFICULT CONVERSATIONS TO WHICH

00:54:29.366 --> 00:54:30.367
FRANKLY THEY WERE.

00:54:30.433 --> 00:54:31.668
TIME TO WHICH I THOUGHT THIS

00:54:31.735 --> 00:54:33.003
COULD BE POSSIBLE THAT WE WOULD

00:54:33.069 --> 00:54:35.338
RESPECTIVELY WALK WALK AWAY.

00:54:35.405 --> 00:54:37.941
A BECAUSE THE DIVIDE WITH TWO

00:54:38.008 --> 00:54:40.477
GREAT -- BUT AS A RESULT OF THE

00:54:40.543 --> 00:54:42.979
WORK IN THE CONVERSATIONS AND OF

00:54:43.046 --> 00:54:46.383
THE SHARED VALUES -- BE REALIZE

00:54:46.449 --> 00:54:47.450
THAT WE HAVE MUCH MORE IN COMMON

00:54:47.517 --> 00:54:51.221
THAN WE HAVE THAT OF DIFFERENCES.

00:54:51.287 --> 00:54:55.358
AND AGAIN IF I CAN JUST READ.

00:54:55.425 --> 00:54:56.259
THE OP ED THAT KEVIN READ AND

00:54:56.326 --> 00:54:57.961
AGAIN KEVIN'S POSITION IS FORMER

00:54:58.028 --> 00:54:59.829
PRESIDENT OF THE NATIONAL

00:54:59.896 --> 00:55:01.197
ASSOCIATION OF EVANGELICALS AND

00:55:01.264 --> 00:55:02.999
IS A FORMER BISHOP OF THE FREE

00:55:03.066 --> 00:55:04.668
METHODIST CHURCH.

00:55:04.734 --> 00:55:06.002
AND HE STATED THAT REPAIRED OF

00:55:06.069 --> 00:55:07.804
THERAPY IS WITHOUT EVIDENCE TO

00:55:07.871 --> 00:55:10.373
IS EFFICACY AND IT IN CONSISTENT

00:55:10.440 --> 00:55:11.841
WITH CHRISTIAN LIVING.

00:55:11.908 --> 00:55:13.877
WE SUPPORT THIS OPPOSITION TO

00:55:13.943 --> 00:55:15.311
THIS PRACTICE BECAUSE THAT HARMS

00:55:15.378 --> 00:55:16.479
PEOPLE.

00:55:16.546 --> 00:55:17.847
THIS IS CONTRARY TO THE NATURE

00:55:17.914 --> 00:55:19.716
OF THE CHRISTIAN MESSAGE WHICH

00:55:19.783 --> 00:55:21.017
WHILE CALLING FOR THE CHANGE OF

00:55:21.084 --> 00:55:22.452
ALL PEOPLE TO BE AUDITED

00:55:22.519 --> 00:55:24.721
ORIENTED TOWARD CHRIST.

00:55:24.788 --> 00:55:25.922
EVEN AT GREAT SACRIFICE NEED THE

00:55:25.989 --> 00:55:29.059
FAVORS NOR SUPPORTS ANY PRACTICE

00:55:29.125 --> 00:55:30.427
THAT CAUSES HARM.

00:55:30.493 --> 00:55:32.562
AGAIN I THINK TO THE POINT THAT

00:55:32.629 --> 00:55:34.431
OUR COLLEAGUES MADE THE NOTION

00:55:34.497 --> 00:55:35.732
OF CONVERSION THERAPY IS

00:55:35.799 --> 00:55:37.033
ANTITHETICAL TO MY VERY

00:55:37.100 --> 00:55:38.401
EXISTENCE MY VERY BEING.

00:55:38.468 --> 00:55:41.938
SITTING HERE -- THAT WE SHOULD

00:55:42.005 --> 00:55:42.972
BE LOVED AND CELEBRATED AND THAT

00:55:43.039 --> 00:55:43.573
THERE'S SOMETHING INHERENTLY

00:55:43.640 --> 00:55:44.407
WRONG THAT SOMETHING SHOULD BE

00:55:44.474 --> 00:55:45.875
CHANGED THERE'S NOTHING WRONG

00:55:45.942 --> 00:55:46.876
WITH.

00:55:46.943 --> 00:55:48.712
INDIVIDUALS LIKE MYSELF --

00:55:48.778 --> 00:55:50.346
MEMBERS OF THE LGBT COMMUNITY.

00:55:50.413 --> 00:55:52.682
AND AGAIN WHAT YOU HAVE HERE IS.

00:55:52.749 --> 00:55:54.217
AN EFFORT A TRANSFORMATIVE

00:55:54.284 --> 00:55:57.153
EFFORT I BELIEVE TO SAYING THAT.

00:55:57.220 --> 00:55:58.488
MEMBERS OF THE RELIGIOUS

00:55:58.555 --> 00:56:00.623
COMMUNITY AND MEMBERS OF

00:56:00.690 --> 00:56:02.192
RELIGIOUS FAITH CAN HOLD HANDS.

00:56:02.258 --> 00:56:03.626
CAN HOLD HANDS WITH MEMBERS OF

00:56:03.693 --> 00:56:05.562
THE LGBT COMMUNITY -- THAT WE

00:56:05.628 --> 00:56:07.497
CAN GET AWAY FROM WHAT WE SEE AT

00:56:07.564 --> 00:56:09.766
THE NATIONAL LEVEL AND THAT OF

00:56:09.833 --> 00:56:13.670
DIVIDE PUT OF COMMONALITY -- AND

00:56:13.737 --> 00:56:16.539

TACTIC TWICE IN THE SAME CASE.

01:25:55.884 --> 01:25:56.317
THE CASE WAS SIMPLE AND

01:25:56.384 --> 01:25:58.419
EXECUTIVE SUING FOR BREACH OF

01:25:58.486 --> 01:26:00.054

MY CASE.

01:26:01.289 --> 01:26:02.757
THE COMPANY DELAYED PAYING ITS

01:26:02.824 --> 01:26:04.459
INITIATION FEE WITH JAMS BECAUSE

01:26:04.526 --> 01:26:06.094

01:26:08.530 --> 01:26:09.197
TO MEDIATION.

01:26:09.264 --> 01:26:10.899
THAT WE HAD SCHEDULED TO TRY TO

01:26:10.965 --> 01:26:12.267

01:26:16.037 --> 01:26:17.939
JAMS AS A MATTER OF POLICY WILL

01:26:18.006 --> 01:26:20.008

01:26:24.445 --> 01:26:25.847
WHEN THE CASE DID NOT SETTLE TO

01:26:34.923 --> 01:26:36.758
SAID NOT.

01:26:36.824 --> 01:26:39.060
SO WITH THE COMPANY DO THEY STOP

01:26:39.127 --> 01:26:40.161
PAYING THE ARBITRATOR'S FEE.

01:26:40.228 --> 01:26:41.362

ARBITRATION SYSTEM IS THAT'S THE

01:29:16.084 --> 01:29:18.586
SAME THING BECAUSE MANY OF THE

01:29:18.653 --> 01:29:19.821

01:29:29.897 --> 01:29:31.265
JUDGES THAT HEARING CASES IN THE

01:29:31.332 --> 01:29:33.034
CIVIL SIDE TEND TO BE DIVERSE E

01:29:33.101 --> 01:29:34.035
NEED MAKE SURE THAT HAPPENS IN

01:29:34.102 --> 01:29:35.136
THE ARBITRATION SIDE BECAUSE

THAT UNFORTUNATELY IS WHERE MANY

01:29:36.504 --> 01:29:38.072

02:02:00.012 --> 02:02:01.213
GOING TO ACCEPT THE CONTRACT AND

02:02:01.280 --> 02:02:03.683
THEN GO BELLY UP THAT INVESTMENT

02:02:03.749 --> 02:02:05.384
THAT THE STATE BOND -- PAYERS

02:02:05.451 --> 02:02:06.619
ARE MAKING INTO THAT PARTICULAR

02:02:06.686 --> 02:02:08.554

YOU'RE NOT DELIVERING IT BASED

02:02:20.332 --> 02:02:21.634
ON THE LOWEST RESPONSIBLE BIDDER

02:02:21.701 --> 02:02:23.402
YOU'RE LOOKING AT OTHER FACTORS

02:02:23.469 --> 02:02:23.936
THAT.

02:02:24.003 --> 02:02:25.304
BASICALLY THE TERM WITH THAT

IN THOSE PARTICULAR COMPLEX

02:02:36.248 --> 02:02:38.250

02:02:38.317 --> 02:02:39.985
MAYBE THEIR BID IS A LITTLE BIT

02:02:40.052 --> 02:02:41.253
HIGHER BUT YOU'RE GETTING THE

02:02:41.320 --> 02:02:42.688
BEST VALUE OUT OF IT.

02:02:42.755 --> 02:02:43.789
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN YOU'RE

02:02:43.856 --> 02:02:45.391
SACRIFICING LABOR STANDARDS AND

02:02:45.458 --> 02:02:51.163
WAGES ALL ALL AND ENCOMPASSING

02:02:51.230 --> 02:02:52.398

02:02:52.465 --> 02:02:53.299
OF PROCUREMENT PRACTICES AND

02:02:53.365 --> 02:02:54.300
ALSO PROJECT DELIVERY METHODS

02:02:54.366 --> 02:02:54.800
SUCH AS MANUFACTURING.

02:02:54.867 --> 02:02:56.102
NEED TO BE CAUGHT UP TO SPEED

02:02:56.168 --> 02:02:57.837
AND THIS LAW ENSURES THAT THAT

SUBSIDY TO THE ACTUAL RECIPIENT.

02:03:14.019 --> 02:03:15.888
WE THINK THAT OUT AS THE STATE

02:03:17.757 --> 02:03:19.258

02:10:47.773 --> 02:10:49.441
I'M.

02:10:49.508 --> 02:10:50.909
THE AMENDMENTS THAT YOU'VE

02:10:50.976 --> 02:10:53.946
INCORPORATED ADDRESS ADDRESS

02:10:54.012 --> 02:10:54.947
ADDRESS THAT CONCERN OKAY AND

02:10:55.013 --> 02:10:56.682
THEN I THINK THE ANOTHER CONCERN

02:10:56.748 --> 02:10:58.650
THAT WAS RAISED IS THAT --

02:10:58.717 --> 02:11:01.520
DISCOVER THIS WOULD GO BEYOND.

02:11:01.587 --> 02:11:02.854
COMPANIES THAT ARE ENGAGED IN

02:11:02.921 --> 02:11:04.456
CONTRACTS AND INCLUDE THINGS

02:11:04.523 --> 02:11:09.561
LIKE -- LIKE CAL COMPETES AND

02:11:09.628 --> 02:11:11.964
AND THOSE SORTS OF PROGRAMS --

02:11:12.030 --> 02:11:14.199
IS IS IS THAT AND AN ACCURATE

02:11:14.266 --> 02:11:15.667
CONCERN AND YOUR HOW WOULD YOU

02:11:15.734 --> 02:11:17.936
RESPOND TO TO THAT CONCERN IN

02:11:18.003 --> 02:11:19.738
TERMS OF OF THE BROADENING OF

02:11:19.805 --> 02:11:23.709
THE SCOPE.

02:11:23.775 --> 02:11:24.343
WHAT YOU WOULD DO THAT MEASURE

02:11:24.409 --> 02:11:25.611
AND WHY WOULD NOT SAY THAT THAT

02:11:25.677 --> 02:11:26.378
IS A CONCERN?

02:11:26.445 --> 02:11:28.347
I THINK -- WHAT WE'RE TALKING

02:11:28.413 --> 02:11:30.215
ABOUT IS A VERY LIMITED CATEGORY

02:11:30.282 --> 02:11:31.416
OF DOCUMENTS MORE TALK ABOUT

02:11:31.483 --> 02:11:32.517
DOCUMENTS THAT ARE ALREADY

02:11:32.584 --> 02:11:35.487
DISPOSABLE UNDER THE CPR IT?

02:11:35.554 --> 02:11:37.022
BUT WHEN WE WHAT WERE WHAT WERE

02:11:37.089 --> 02:11:38.390
EXPLICITLY INCLUDING IN THIS

02:11:38.457 --> 02:11:39.157
BILL.

02:11:39.224 --> 02:11:40.692
I WHEN THERE ARE PROMISES BEING

02:11:40.759 --> 02:11:43.295
MADE IN EXCHANGE FOR SUBSIDIES

02:11:43.362 --> 02:11:44.663
IN EXCHANGE FOR CONTRACTS.

02:11:44.730 --> 02:11:46.598
WHERE IN EXCHANGE FOR THE MONEY

02:11:46.665 --> 02:11:47.232
THAT WE ARE GIVING TO

02:11:47.299 --> 02:11:49.901
CONTRACTORS THEY SAY WE'RE GOING

02:11:49.968 --> 02:11:51.236
TO CREATE THIS NUMBER OF JOBS

02:11:51.303 --> 02:11:52.971
WERE GOING TO PROVIDE A LIVING

02:11:53.038 --> 02:11:54.106
WAGE JOBS WERE IN PROVIDE THESE

02:11:54.172 --> 02:11:56.775
BENEFITS -- THAT'S WHEN WE NEED

02:11:56.842 --> 02:11:58.577
TO BE ABLE TO ENFORCE THOSE

02:11:58.644 --> 02:12:01.980
PROMISES -- I I THINK THAT IF WE

02:12:02.047 --> 02:12:04.650
ARE GIVING OUT TREMENDOUSLY --

02:12:04.716 --> 02:12:05.884
YOU KNOW TREMENDOUS I SIZE

02:12:05.951 --> 02:12:06.685
SUBSIDIES.

02:12:06.752 --> 02:12:11.256
IN EXCHANGE FOR PROMISES THOSE

02:12:11.323 --> 02:12:13.759
PROMISES SHOULD BE ENFORCEABLE.

02:12:13.825 --> 02:12:14.793
SO JUST TO ADD TO THAT --

02:12:14.860 --> 02:12:15.360
NOTHING IN THIS BILL WOULD

02:12:15.427 --> 02:12:17.496
REQUIRE PUBLIC AGENCIES TO

02:12:17.562 --> 02:12:18.697
OBTAIN RECORDS THAT ARE NOT

02:12:18.764 --> 02:12:21.266
WITHIN THEIR ACTUAL OR

02:12:21.333 --> 02:12:23.068
CONSTRUCTIVE POSSESSION --

02:12:23.135 --> 02:12:25.771
THAT'S REALLY CLEAR AS WELL SO

02:12:25.837 --> 02:12:27.773
WE'RE NOT LOOKING TO GET.

02:12:27.839 --> 02:12:29.274
ANY THIRD PARTY RECORDS JUST

02:12:29.341 --> 02:12:31.643
WHAT'S IN THAT AGENCIES

02:12:31.710 --> 02:12:34.246
POSSESSION AND CONTROL RIGHT AND

02:12:34.313 --> 02:12:36.315
FOR THE PURPOSE OF INSURING TO

02:12:36.381 --> 02:12:39.184
YOUR POINT THAT THE THE PROMISES

02:12:39.251 --> 02:12:41.053
THAT HAVE BEEN MADE.

02:12:41.119 --> 02:12:43.155
NOT TO US BUT TO CALIFORNIA

02:12:43.221 --> 02:12:44.056
TAXPAYERS.

02:12:44.122 --> 02:12:45.257
CAN I SAY YOU KNOW THESE ARE

02:12:45.324 --> 02:12:49.728
DOCUMENTS THAT OFTENTIMES THE

02:12:49.795 --> 02:12:51.730
CONTRACTOR SAYS HOW MUCH IS THE

02:12:51.797 --> 02:12:53.332
PROJECT AT A COST HOW MUCH ARE

02:12:53.398 --> 02:12:54.833
YOU GONNA BE PAID FOR RIGHT.

WHEN WE ARE CONTRACTING TO

02:12:56.568 --> 02:12:58.737
EXPLICITLY INCLUDE PROMISES THE

02:12:58.804 --> 02:13:00.005
GO BEYOND THAT?

02:13:00.072 --> 02:13:02.274
THOSE PROMISES ARE WHAT SHOULD

02:13:02.341 --> 02:13:03.575
BE DISCLOSED.

02:13:03.642 --> 02:13:05.444
AND IT'S REALLY A PRETTY FINITE

02:13:05.510 --> 02:13:07.779
SMALL A NUMBER OF SCENARIOS THAT

02:13:07.846 --> 02:13:08.980
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IT'S AN

02:13:09.047 --> 02:13:10.982
EXCHANGE FOR THESE TAX DOLLARS

02:13:11.049 --> 02:13:13.452
THAT WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO HAVE

02:13:13.518 --> 02:13:15.454
ACCESS TO THESE RECORDS.

02:13:15.520 --> 02:13:16.121

I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING

02:13:22.394 --> 02:13:23.295
THIS FOR THIS IS LONG BEEN A

02:13:23.362 --> 02:13:24.830
CONCERN IF WE ARE.

02:13:24.896 --> 02:13:27.032
IN FACT GIVING.

02:13:27.099 --> 02:13:28.800
TAX BENEFIT OR OTHERS NOT

02:13:28.867 --> 02:13:30.335
GETTING THE INFORMATION BACK TO

02:13:30.402 --> 02:13:31.970
BE ABLE TO JUSTIFY THAT IS IS

02:13:32.037 --> 02:13:34.606
CERTAINLY A A FRUSTRATION AND

02:13:34.673 --> 02:13:35.440
AND AND IT'S A LITTLE BIT

02:13:35.507 --> 02:13:36.742
INTERESTING OF AN ARGUMENT

02:13:36.808 --> 02:13:38.243
BECAUSE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS

02:13:38.310 --> 02:13:39.778
SOMETHING IS NOT A TRADE SECRET.

02:13:39.845 --> 02:13:42.447
BUT THEN FOR A COMPANY TO WANT

02:13:42.514 --> 02:13:44.082
TO ASSERT THAT AS A TRADE SECRET

02:13:44.149 --> 02:13:46.551
LATER ON IS TO ME A BIT SPEECHES

02:13:50.589 --> 02:13:53.125
WATER AND I THINK THAT'S JUST A

02:13:53.191 --> 02:13:54.960
AT AN ATTEMPT TO OBFUSCATE HERE

02:13:55.026 --> 02:13:55.994
A LITTLE BIT.

USEFUL OF THOSE TOOLS IS

02:25:19.210 --> 02:25:20.478
OBTAINING THE DOCUMENTS THAT

02:25:34.592 --> 02:25:37.328
PROCESS IS NOW BEEN AN EXERCISE.

02:25:37.395 --> 02:25:40.131
MANY TIMES IN GAMESMANSHIP.

02:25:40.198 --> 02:25:41.499
IN THAT EXERCISE HAS BECOME

02:25:41.566 --> 02:25:43.668
INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE AN

02:25:43.734 --> 02:25:45.536
INCREDIBLY TIME CONSUMING IN OUR

02:25:45.603 --> 02:25:48.206
OWN COUNTY OF ORANGE IT CAN BE

02:25:48.272 --> 02:25:49.273
AND THIS THIS IS.

02:25:49.340 --> 02:25:50.942
RELATIVELY ROUTINE FOURTEEN

02:25:51.008 --> 02:25:52.443

SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT

02:26:02.286 --> 02:26:04.155

STATE LAW THEY DO NOT BECOME

02:26:16.400 --> 02:26:17.702

02:26:35.119 --> 02:26:36.821

02:26:40.158 --> 02:26:41.626
THAT'S THE PORTION OF THE BILL

02:26:41.692 --> 02:26:42.960
THAT COMES FROM THE FEDERAL

02:26:43.027 --> 02:26:43.928
RULES OF CRIMINAL EXCUSE ME

02:26:43.995 --> 02:26:45.696
CIVIL PROCEDURE. TWENTY SIX THE

02:26:45.763 --> 02:26:47.498
SECOND PART OF THE BILL DEALS

02:26:47.565 --> 02:26:48.366
WITH.

02:26:48.432 --> 02:26:51.669
ISSUES WHERE ATTORNEYS ROUTINELY

02:26:51.736 --> 02:26:54.172
FOR EXAMPLE FILE OBJECTIONS TO

02:26:54.238 --> 02:26:54.939
REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION OF

02:26:55.006 --> 02:26:56.641
DOCUMENTS WITHOUT REALLY

02:26:56.707 --> 02:26:58.075
THINKING THROUGH THEY JUST

02:26:58.142 --> 02:27:02.980
FOLLOW BLANKET OBJECTION.

02:27:03.047 --> 02:27:03.614
THE OTHER SIDE THAT HAS TO MEET

02:27:03.681 --> 02:27:04.815
AND FOR THAT PROCESS MAY SEEM

02:27:04.882 --> 02:27:05.816
SIMPLE BUT IT IS NOT IT CAN TAKE

02:27:05.883 --> 02:27:07.752
QUITE A LONG TIME. TO GET THE

02:27:07.818 --> 02:27:10.488
PARTIES TOGETHER IN IT INVITES

02:27:10.555 --> 02:27:12.390
AGAIN INVITES GAMESMANSHIP AND

02:27:12.456 --> 02:27:13.391
THEN IN SOME COUNTIES NO YOU

02:27:13.457 --> 02:27:14.425
HAVE TO GO THROUGH AN INFORMAL

02:27:14.492 --> 02:27:15.960
DISCOVERY PROCESS.

02:27:16.027 --> 02:27:17.528
WHICH FURTHER DELAYS BEFORE YOU

02:27:17.595 --> 02:27:19.030
CAN GET TO THE ACTUAL MOTION TO

02:27:19.096 --> 02:27:20.131
COMPEL AND THEN YOU CALL TO GET

02:27:20.198 --> 02:27:21.499
ON THE CALENDAR FOR THE MOTION

02:27:21.566 --> 02:27:23.167
COMPOUND THAT CAN BE. FOR

02:27:23.234 --> 02:27:25.336
EXAMPLE LOS ANGELES COUNTY --

02:27:25.403 --> 02:27:26.771
YOU CAN BE SIX MONTHS IN ORANGE

02:27:26.837 --> 02:27:27.972
COUNTY COULD BE FOR MONTHS.

02:27:28.039 --> 02:27:29.507
AND SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT

02:27:29.574 --> 02:27:31.375
SAYS TO THE COURT THAT WHEN YOU

02:27:31.442 --> 02:27:33.110
OBSERVE THIS GAMESMANSHIP WHEN

02:27:33.177 --> 02:27:34.412
YOU OBSERVE FOLKS FILING

02:27:34.478 --> 02:27:36.314
OBJECTIONS NOT IN GOOD FAITH

02:27:36.380 --> 02:27:37.481
WHEN YOU SEE FOLKS WERE NOT

02:27:37.548 --> 02:27:38.916
MEETING GOOD FAITH.

02:27:38.983 --> 02:27:42.153
WHEN YOU SEE PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT

02:27:42.220 --> 02:27:43.888
BASICALLY COOPERATING -- IN THE

02:27:43.955 --> 02:27:46.591
PROCESS AS IT WAS DESIGNED THEN

02:27:46.657 --> 02:27:47.925
YOU WERE REQUIRED TO SANCTION.

02:27:47.992 --> 02:27:49.527
AND AND THE SANCTION IS IN

02:27:49.594 --> 02:27:50.828
ADDITION TO REASONABLE TOURNEY'S

02:27:50.895 --> 02:27:52.296
FEES IF THE COURT SHOULD SO

02:27:52.363 --> 02:27:53.030
ORDER.

02:27:53.097 --> 02:27:54.799
BUT IT PROVIDES FOR THOUSAND

02:27:54.865 --> 02:27:56.234
DOLLARS SANCTION ALSO --

02:27:56.300 --> 02:27:58.703
PROVIDES FOR AN ESCAPE VALVE.

02:27:58.769 --> 02:28:01.872
SHOULD THE ISSUE BE LITIGATED IN

02:28:01.939 --> 02:28:03.841
GOOD FAITH SO FOR EXAMPLE ISSUES

02:28:03.908 --> 02:28:07.578
OVER -- OVER PRIVILEGE THE THERE

02:28:07.645 --> 02:28:10.114
ARE THERE ARE LEGIT WELL LITTLE

GERMAN ISSUES OVER MANY THINGS

BUT BUT ARGUMENTS OVER PRIVILEGE

02:28:12.550 --> 02:28:13.684
CAN BECOME DIFFICULT.

02:28:13.751 --> 02:28:15.286
AND IN GOOD FAITH THEY CAN LEAD

02:28:15.353 --> 02:28:16.787
TO GET IT THE COURT FINDS THAT

02:28:16.854 --> 02:28:18.322
THAT ITS LITIGATING GOOD FAITH

02:28:18.389 --> 02:28:20.391
THAT THE COURT CAN EXCUSE THOSE

02:28:20.458 --> 02:28:24.228

02:37:20.764 --> 02:37:22.699
IN WITH RESPECT TO FAMILY LAW I

02:37:22.766 --> 02:37:23.033
THINK THERE.

02:37:23.100 --> 02:37:24.201
THE THE BIGGEST CONCERN THAT I

02:37:24.268 --> 02:37:25.769
HAD I APPRECIATE YOU TAKE THE

02:37:25.836 --> 02:37:27.471
AMENDMENT OR THE NUMBER OF

02:37:27.538 --> 02:37:29.973
UNREPRESENTED LITIGANTS IN THE

02:37:30.040 --> 02:37:31.241
FAMILY LAW SYSTEM AND I AND I

02:37:31.308 --> 02:37:33.243
THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE A

02:37:33.310 --> 02:37:34.945
CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE THERE ARE

02:37:35.012 --> 02:37:36.747
CHALLENGES FOR AN AND

02:37:36.814 --> 02:37:37.347
REPRESENTED LITIGANTS REALLY

02:37:37.414 --> 02:37:38.148
UNDERSTAND.

02:37:38.215 --> 02:37:40.317
CIVIL PROCEDURE AND THE NUANCES

02:37:40.384 --> 02:37:42.519
THERE SO WE CERTAINLY DON'T WANT

02:37:42.586 --> 02:37:44.021
TO BE CATCHING THEM UP IN THAT.

02:37:44.087 --> 02:37:45.355
AND AS THE HOUSES POINTS OUT

02:37:45.422 --> 02:37:47.357
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF SANCTIONS

02:37:47.424 --> 02:37:49.059
PROVISIOS THAT THE COURTS ARE

02:37:49.126 --> 02:37:50.961
GOING TO NEED TO HARMONIZE.

02:37:51.028 --> 02:37:52.329
BUT I THINK YOU'RE PUTTING.

02:37:52.396 --> 02:37:53.764
AND BECAUSE BOTH PARTIES ARE

02:37:53.831 --> 02:37:55.532
GONNA ESSENTIALLY NEED TO AGREE

02:37:55.599 --> 02:37:57.267
TO THIS.

02:37:57.334 --> 02:37:58.836
THIS WILL BE VERY INTERESTING

02:37:58.902 --> 02:37:59.636
EXPERIMENT TO SEE HOW THIS MOVES

02:37:59.703 --> 02:38:02.406
FORWARD AND CHANGES THAT DYNAMIC

02:38:02.472 --> 02:38:04.408
OF THE LEVEL OF GAMES THAT GET

02:38:04.474 --> 02:38:04.942
PLAYED.

02:38:05.008 --> 02:38:07.511
AS WE'RE IN AN ERA WHERE ACCESS

02:38:07.578 --> 02:38:08.512
TO JUSTICE IS CERTAINLY A

02:38:08.579 --> 02:38:10.013
CHALLENGE AND IN THE CIVIL SIDE

02:38:10.080 --> 02:38:11.682
SO MANY.

02:38:11.748 --> 02:38:14.318
CASES ARE NOT GOING ON ON TIMELY

02:38:14.384 --> 02:38:15.652
MATTERS IN OF BIRTH IN FRONT OF

02:38:15.719 --> 02:38:17.521
JUDGE AS ANY EXACERBATIONS OF

02:38:17.588 --> 02:38:18.522
THAT AND ESPECIALLY

02:38:18.589 --> 02:38:20.457
EXACERBATIONS THAT TEND TO BE

02:38:20.524 --> 02:38:22.292
MORE OF GAME PLAYING THAT NOT.

02:38:22.359 --> 02:38:23.193

02:38:31.935 --> 02:38:32.669
COURTS.

02:38:32.736 --> 02:38:35.472

THAT THAT DISCOVERY DOES WORK

02:39:05.869 --> 02:39:07.337
MUCH BETTER THE FEDERAL COURTS

02:39:07.404 --> 02:39:08.839
THAN IT DOES IN THE STATE COURTS
