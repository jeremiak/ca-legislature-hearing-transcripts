HERE I THINK HE'S UP IN JUDAS WHERE I WAS -- SO THANK YOU AT FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT THIS BILL IT IS I'M A VERY I I THINK SIMPLE BILL IN SOMETHING THAT BECAME AN ISSUE IN MY DISTRICT IN MY AREA AND SO ONE THAT WE THOUGHT WE PURSUE. BASICALLY THE REALITY IS -- OFTEN BECAUSE THE HOUSING CRISIS BUT ALSO BECAUSE OF CULTURAL DIFFERENCES IN IMMIGRANT REFUGEE POPULATIONS WE HAVE MORE AND MORE PEOPLE WHO. MAY HAVE A STOREFRONT BUSINESS -- AND LIVE IN THE BACK OR ABOVE IT IN AND THAT'S ACTUALLY THE RESIDENTS IN -- SAN DIEGO AND I'M SURE IN OTHER PLACES OFTEN IF YOU HAVE REGISTERED AT EIGHTY AYE AYE YOUR DOMICILE AT A BUSINESS ADDRESS I CAN GET THROWN OUT WE HAD IN FACT. ELECTION WHERE -- THE DECIDING DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE VOTES WAS TO VOTE AND WE SAW ABOUT TEN BALLOTS GET THROWN OUT BECAUSE THEY WERE BUSINESS ADDRESSES. THAT WE WANT TO CLARIFY THAT -- A DOMICILE CAN IN FACT BE AT A BUSINESS ADDRESS OF THE PERSON ACTUALLY RESIDES THERE THAT'S ALL THIS BILL DOES RESPECT LAST FROM ABOUT. ALL RIGHT -- SUPPORT YOUR ROSE LEGAL RIVER IS A CALIFORNIA AND STRONG SUPPORT IS CURRENTLY WRITTEN WERE CONCERNED OF LOS AND BIG US ENOUGH. TO LEAVE SOME CONFUSION RELATED TO IMPLEMENTATION. BOTH VOTERS UNDERSTANDING AS TO WHERE THEY CAN REGISTER AND AND OFFICIAL BOB PROCESSING AND ESPECIALLY AS WE RAMP UP. OF A PROVISIONAL VOTING THROUGH CONDITIONAL VOTER REGISTRATION WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE PUT THEIR BUSINESS. ADDRESS WHERE THEY ARE IN FACT DOMICILED ON THOSE PROVISIONAL BALLOT CONDITIONAL VOTER REGISTRATION ENVELOPES THAT THEIR PROCESS CORRECTLY -- AND AND AS WAS IT IS IT'S CLEAR THAT. AS WAS INDICATED WE'VE GOT INCREASINGLY DIFFERENT KINDS OF HOUSING THAT PEOPLE ARE USING. AND A STRICT OF DELINEATION DOESN'T MEET THE REALITY OF THOSE SORTS OF HOUSING AND JUST FROM A PERSONAL PERSPECTIVE MY DAUGHTER JUST GOT MARRIED. TO A MAN WHOSE PARENTS MANAGE A DRY CLEANING BUSINESS IN SAN FRANCISCO THEY LIVE BEHIND IN A TINY LITTLE ROOM BEHIND THE DRY CLEANING BUSINESS. THEY SPEAK CHINESE A SPEAK CANTONESE THEY'RE ALREADY CONFUSED ENOUGH ABOUT THE REGULATIONS THE LAWS THEY'RE A LITTLE BIT AFRAID. OF SUCH THINGS LIKE FOOD REGISTRATION BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO MAKE A MISTAKE IN THOSE ARE THE SORTS OF FOLKS UNDER REPRESENTED VOTERS -- IN CALIFORNIA THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE ARE ABLE TO REGISTER WITHOUT. CONCERNS LIKE THAT IS WHEN THEY LIVE -- AT THE PLACE THAT THEY DO BUSINESS [inaudible] THANK YOU. TO ME OTHERS IN SUPPORT [inaudible] OPPOSITION [inaudible] MR. GO AHEAD ASK YOUR QUESTION SEVEN HERTZBERG AND WILL TAKE IT OFF THERE'S JUST A MOST OF OUR HISTORY PEOPLE DID LIVE WITH THEIR WORK YOU KNOW THE WALK UPS AND ALL THE OTHER THINGS THAT. HE WAS DESTINY IS BORN INTO PLACES EMPHASIS GOERS PARENTS LIVED IN THE ON THE SAME SIDE THAT HAS BEEN THE HISTORY -- I'M JUST WONDER WHAT THE REASON FOR THE RULE WAS TO SEPARATE AS LONG AS YOU LIVE IN THE SAME JURISDICTION I EAT ARE QUITE FRANKLY USED TO REGISTER MY LAW OFFICE. BUT MY LAW OFFICES TWO BLOCKS AWAY FROM WHERE BY APARTMENT WAS AND IT WAS THE SAME JURISDICTION SO I JUST MAYES SAMPRAS LIKE GETTING ALL MY MAIL IN ONE PLACE. WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE AS LONG AS YOU'RE NOT? MR DISTINCTION -- DIFFERENCES SEEMS TO ME AND AND YOU KNOW WE'RE GOING BACK TO THE FUTURE IN A SENSE OF THESE THINGS WE MAKE THESE EXAMPLES I MEAN THIS IS BEEN SO MUCH OF HOW WE'VE LIVED OUR LIVES AS ONE WHEN THE LAW WAS CHANGED IS KIND OF INTERESTING TO ME. WE ARE TRYING TO PHONY ANYBODY UP YOU JUST WANNA MAKE CONVENIENCE. SO WHILE I DON'T WANNA -- SUGGEST TO YOU THAT YOU MIGHT A BROKEN THE LAW WHEN YOU REGISTER TO YOUR LOT ACTUALLY. HOWEVER I I'M SURE STATURE LIMITATIONS IS RUN -- BUT BUT I THINK THAT IT'S YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY WE WE DON'T WANT PEOPLE GAMING THE SYSTEM YOU KNOW WE DON'T WANT PEOPLE REGISTERING AND TO A DIFFERENT -- DISTRICT. ESPECIALLY TO RUN FOR OFFICE BECAUSE OUR BUSINESSES THERE BUT THE REALITIES OF TODAY'S WORLD IS THAT WE DO ONCE AGAIN -- AT RETURN I GUESS TO HOUSING CRISIS A LARGE IMMIGRANT POPULATIONS REFUGEE POPULATIONS AROUND SMALL BUSINESSES OFTEN -- HELP THE SITUATION COME UP [inaudible] OPPOSITION. I YES MY NAME IS COLIN BRITAIN I'M WITH THE ELECTION INTEGRITY PROJECT CALIFORNIA. AND ELECTION INTEGRITY PROJECT CALIFORNIA STRONGLY OPPOSES AB. SIX NINETY SIX SEVENTY NINE WE BELIEVE THAT IT WOULD FACILITATE UNLIMITED OPPORTUNITIES FOR REGISTRATION FRAUD AND REMOVE THE ABILITY TO MAINTAIN ACCURATE VOTER ROLLS OF FAT EFFICIENTLY. CURRENT LAW REQUIRES A VOTERS REGISTER IN A RED AT A RESIDENTIAL STREET ADDRESS NOT A POST OFFICE BOX OR BUSINESS ADDRESS AB. SIX SEVENTY NINE WOULD ALLOW IN INDIVIDUALS TO BE LEGALLY REGISTERED AT A BUSINESS ADDRESS UNDER CERTAIN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES. THAT ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO RESEARCH OR VERIFY. THOSE CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES ARE WHEN A PERSON SEPARATES FROM THE FAMILY AND TAKES UP RESIDENCE IN A LOCATION OF THEIR BUSINESS. THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO SEPARATE FROM FAMILY AND ALSO OWN A BUSINESS ESTABLISHMENT THAT LENDS ITSELF TO BEING INCLUDED. AS A RESIDENTIAL SITUATION MUST BE FAIRLY RARE BUT IF A THE SIX SIX SEVENTY NINE IS AN ACTIVE VOTER ROLLS CAN NO LONGER BE RESEARCH TO FOR ILLEGAL ADDRESS. REGISTRATIONS BECAUSE OF THIRTIES WOULD HAVE TO ASSUME. THAT EVERYONE REGISTERED AT A BUSINESS ADDRESS IS LIVING THERE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES ALLOWED BY THE LAW. THIS FACILITATES A HUGE OPPORTUNITY FOR REGISTRATION FRAUD. IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE ELECTION INTEGRITY PROJECT CALIFORNIA DATA TEAM. FOUND THAT NO SMALL NUMBER OF BUSINESSES BUSINESS ESTABLISHMENTS FROM FAST FOOD RESTAURANTS TO PSYCHIATRISTS OFFICE. I HAD A HIGH NUMBERS OF REGISTRATIONS OFTEN ISN'T AS AT AND ABOVE. ALTHOUGH A SMALL NUMBER OF THESE PEOPLE MAY BE REGISTERED LEGALLY BECAUSE OF THE HOMELESS CONDITION. THE MAJORITY ARE NOT AND MUST BE REMOVED FROM THE ROLLS. AB SIX SEVENTY NINE WOULD COMPLICATE SUCH VOTER ROLL MAIN MAINTENANCE TO THE POINT OF IMPOSSIBILITY. THE SITUATION PRESENTS A HUGE OPPORTUNITY FOR REGISTRATION FRAUD AND SHOULD NOT BE ENACTED. THE ELECTION INTEGRITY PROJECT CALIFORNIA STRONGLY OPPOSES THIS BILL AB SIX SEVENTY NINE THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME THANK YOU THANK YOU MA'AM -- OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE -- QUESTIONS ALRIGHT HELLO MOVES -- THE BILL. WOULD LIKE CLOSE THE MOON THEMSELVES DISRESPECT LAST WHEN I VOTED IN FRANCHISE AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE. THANK YOU.
