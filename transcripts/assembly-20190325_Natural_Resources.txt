FOR NATURAL RESOURCES -- I JUST SAW MISTER MAYNES. WHO IS NOT READY TO HAVE ANOTHER AUTHOR ASSIGNED AN AUTHOR READY? OKAY SOON AS WE HAVE AN AUTHOR WILL BEGIN THE HEARING IF THERE ANY AUTHORS WHO ARE WATCHING ANY MEMBERS WHO ARE WATCHING THE COMMITTEE. WHO HAVE SIGNED IN AND HAVE A BILL THIS IS YOUR CHANCE ANY AUTHORS WHO HAVE A BILL IN NATURAL RESOURCES PLEASE COME AND PRESENT YOUR BILL MR BERMAN WELCOME WE ARE -- DO NOT OF A QUORUM YET WE'RE GONNA BE BEGINNING AS A SUB COMMITTEE -- BUT YOU'RE WELCOME 2%. AND TODAY YOU WILL BE PRESENTING ON ON EIGHTY SEVEN EIGHTY TWO I REALIZE THAT EASY WAYS OF TRACKS IN THE NATION. THE PROPOSED EXEMPTION UNDER THIS BILL SHOULD NOT. BECAUSE THE EXISTING SIMPLE GUIDELINES ALREADY PROVIDED SIMILAR. I BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE REASONS WHY THESE THINGS. ARE REALLY -- PERSON SIMILAR ACQUISITION OF LANDS ABOUT EXHAUSTION OF USE. WOULD NOT AND COULD NOT HAVE AN EXACT SECOND REQUIRED RESOURCES. THIRD. OVER. THE TO ACQUIRE LAND FROM A WILLING LANDOWNER TO PROTECTED IN PERPETUITY FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS DOES NOT STAY OPEN VERY LONG. THE EXEMPTION IS NEEDED BECAUSE RECENT LAWSUITS HAVE CREATED UNCERTAINTY. YOU CAN GO THANK YOU AND I I EIGHT I THINK THAT YOUR MICROPHONE IS OFF FOR THE ROOM I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S ON FOR COULD YOU HEAR HIM IN THE BACK. NO THE MICRA SO IF IF WE CAN TRY TO WORK ON THE TECHNICAL ISSUES SO THAT. TRY SPEAKING AGAIN TESTING TESTING THEIR AGO OKAY THANK YOU. OKAY WE GOT IT. OKAY NO I DO THAT ALL OVER AGAIN NO NO. IT WAS GREAT BY THE WAY -- DO WE NEED TO HAVE HIM DO IT AGAIN FOR ANY LEGAL REASONS. IT WAS IT WAS IT ON THE TO ON THE TELEVISION. WAS IT PICKED UP BY THE TO HELP. THEY DO HAVE IT. DAVID NOW. DO THEY HAVE IT WHEN HE WAS SPEAKING. IN THE OPENING STATEMENT. I YEAH I WAS JUST TOLD THAT FROM THE OPENING STATEMENT AND IT DOES NOT NEED TO TO BE I'M PRESENTING AB SEVENTY TWO IT'S A GREAT BILL I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR I THINK IT WOULD THAT WILL GO TO YOUR WITNESS. EACH WITNESS WILL HAVE TWO MINUTES PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS ANNE DEISTER AND I AM THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA COUNCIL OF LAND TRUSTS ALSO KNOWN AS C. CLT. AND WE ARE THE PROUD SPONSOR OF AB. SEVEN EIGHTY TWO SEE SEE ALTES MISSION IS TO CONSERVE CALIFORNIA'S EXTRAORDINARY LAND AND WATER RESOURCES THROUGH A STRONG NETWORK OF LAND TRUST WITH ONE COHESIVE BOYS ACROSS URBAN AND RURAL COMMUNITIES. WE SERVE A UNIFIED VOICE FOR MORE THAN A HUNDRED FIFTY LAND TRUST WORKING THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. WE SEE A FUTURE WHERE ALL CALIFORNIA RESIDENT SHARE A COMMON CONSERVATION ETHIC. AND BENEFIT FROM HAVING ACCESS TO CLEAN WATER HEALTHY FOOD PARKS AND OTHER NATURAL LANDS WHERE THEY LIVE. AB SEVEN EIGHTY TWO IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL TO THIS MISSION. AS YOU JUST HEARD FROM ASSEMBLYMEMBER BERMAN THERE HAVE BEEN RECENT SEE QUIRK LAWSUITS THAT HAVE CREATED UNCERTAINTY FOR STATE AGENCIES SEEKING TO PROTECT LAND IN PERPETUITY FOR CONSERVATION PURPOSES. AND THIS HAS THE POTENTIAL OF SETTING A VERY TROUBLING PRECEDENT -- FOR PROTECTING NATURAL AND WORKING LANDS FOR WATER SUPPLY ENDANGERED SPECIES AND AGRICULTURAL USES AND TO ACHIEVE CLIMATE GOALS. COURTS IN SOME OF THESE CASES OF HOW THE PUBLIC AGENCIES VIOLATED SEE QUIRK SIMPLY BY AGREEING TO PURCHASE THE LAND WITHOUT ANY ANALYSIS. OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF POTENTIAL RESTORATION OR PRESERVATION ACTIVITIES. AB SEVEN EIGHTY TWO WOULD END THIS UNCERTAINTY BY CLARIFYING THAT PUBLIC AGENCIES MAY ACQUIRE LAND FOR CONSERVATION PURPOSES INCLUDING THE CRITICAL PROCESS OF OBTAINING GRANT FUNDING FOR THE ACQUISITION. WITHOUT FIRST CONDUCTING ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW BUT ONLY SO LONG AS THE PUBLIC AGENCY HAS COMMITTED TO FULLY COMPLY WITH SYKORA PRIOR TO COMMENCING ANY PHYSICAL CHANGE TO THE ENVIRONMENT. THIS BILL WOULD THAT'S RESTORE THE COMMON PRACTICE PRIOR TO THE MORE RECENT LINE OF CASES. AND WOULD PROVIDE A BRIGHT LINE RULE FOR COURTS LAND TRUSTS PUBLIC AGENCIES AND THE PUBLIC TO FOLLOW. AB SEVEN EIGHTY TWO WOULD NOT CREATE A NEW SIBLING SEPARATE EXEMPTION OR EXPAND AN EXISTING EXEMPTION. RATHER IT WOULD SIMPLY CODIFIED THE REGULATORY GUIDANCE ALREADY PROVIDED IN SEQUEL GUIDELINES. C. CLT WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR AND HIS STAFF FOR CURING THIS LEGISLATION. IN OUR VIEW THIS ABSOLUTELY OF STATEWIDE INTEREST TO OUR STATE AGENCIES TO ACQUIRE VALUABLE RESOURCE PLANS WHEN THOSE LIMITED OPPORTUNITIES BECOME AVAILABLE AND AB SEVENTY TWO WOULD PROVIDE THE CLARITY AND THE LAW. FOR SIMPLE ACQUISITION OF RESOURCE PLANS TO BE EXEMPT FROM SICKLE REVIEW WHILE ALSO CRITICALLY ENSURING THAT FULL SEQUEL COMPLIANCE MUST OCCUR. PRIOR TO THE AGENCY MAKING ANY PHYSICAL CHANGES TO THE PROPERTY FOR ALL THESE REASONS WE URGENT HI VOTE THANK YOU BEFORE WE CONTINUE WITH THE HEARING I'M GOING TO TAKE A BRIEF PAUSE TO ESTABLISH A QUORUM.

AIR BE JUST PUT OUT A NATURAL WORKING LANCE CLIMATE -- IMPLEMENTATION PLAN THEY ALL HAVE -- AS A KEY COMPONENT TO THOSE PLANS THE ABILITY TO CONSERVE. OCCUR BY ACQUISITION OR BY EASEMENT ON HIGH VALUE RESOURCE LAND.

I SEE ASSEMBLY MEMBER DAILY. WITH AB. ONE SEVENTY EIGHT THE MANAGER MEMBERS. FIRST I'D LIKE TO THINK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THE WORK -- WITH ME AND I'M WILLING TO TAKE THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS LABORS ANY AB ONE SEVEN EIGHT THAT WILL CREATE A NARROW EXEMPTION. FOR THE MANDATORY SOLAMENTE FOR PEOPLE HAVE LOST THEIR HOMES DUE TO CATASTROPHIC EVENT. WHEN A STATE OF EMERGENCY HAS BEEN DECLARED BY THE GOVERNOR? CALIFORNIANS EXPERIENCE SEVERAL CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES. THE IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WHICH IS TO ABOUT ONE POINT SIX MILLION ACRES OF LAND AND THOUSANDS OF HOME. SEVERAL OF THESE HOMES WERE UNDER INSURED AND WITH ALL THE INCREASED COST OF THIRTY WITH REBUILDING DUE TO THE NEW BUILDING STANDARDS. AND MAKING IT DIFFICULT FOR SOME TO REBUILD THE COST OF A SOLAR SYSTEM ALONE CAN ADD UP TO TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS AND TO THE COST OF REBUILDING. AB ONE SEVENTY EIGHT WILL GIVE A NARROW EXEMPTION FROM THIS MANDATE TO THOSE WHO MEET. A CERTAIN CRITERIA THIS WILL GIVE THEM THE NECESSARY LEAVE FOR SOME OF THESE PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO REBUILD THEIR HOME AND START PUTTING THEIR LIVES BACK TOGETHER OF COURSE. IF THEY CHOOSE TO INSTALL SOLAR THEY CAN. LETS BUT THESE PEOPLE. LET'S HELP THESE PEOPLE GET BACK IN THEIR HOMES AND REPAIR THEIR LIVES I RESPECT THE ASPEN ABOUT. YES WITH THE THANK YOU YOU HAVE ANY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. I WAS THERE ANYBODY WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN FAVOR OF THIS BILL MOVE THE BILL. WE HAVE A MOTION A SECOND. HI JOHN KENNEDY WITH RURAL COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIA WE SUPPORT THE BILL WE THINK IT'S A GOOD WAY TO PROVIDE LIMITED RELIEF TO HOMEOWNERS WHO HAVE LOST EVERYTHING -- IN AN ERA WHERE MANY PEOPLE ARE UNDER INSURED AND OTHERS ARE UNINSURED MANY BY. WITHOUT THEIR OWN CHOICE WE THINK THIS HELPS TO MAKE IT A LITTLE MORE AFFORDABLE TO REBUILD PEOPLE'S LIVES. THANK YOU -- ADAM WRIGLEY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE -- DEFTLY ECHO -- MY COUNTERPARTS WE SUPPORT THE BILL WE THINK IT'S COMMONSENSE VERY NARROW -- RELIEF FOR SOME OF THE MOST -- DEVASTATED CITIZENS OF CALIFORNIA THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON YOU LIKE EVER WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS WERE NOT REFLECTED IN THE ANALYSIS BUT WE ARE IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION OKAY. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M VICTORIA ROME WITH THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL REGRETFULLY IN OPPOSITION AND WE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO SIT DOWN WITH MISTER DALI WE APPRECIATE HIS TIME AND MEETING WITH US. BUT WE JUST DISAGREE THAT -- COMPLYING WITH THE SOLAR MANDATE IS A COST OR BURDEN -- SYMPATHIZE WITH VICTIMS OF WILD FIRE CERTAINLY BUT WE THINK THAT ADDING SOLAR -- AND THERE ARE FLEXIBLE WAYS TO COMPLY WITH THE REGULATION -- IS ACTUALLY BENEFIT TO THE HOMEOWNER OVER THE LIFE OF THEIR OCCUPANCY OF THAT HOME THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE WANTING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION. LAUREN COLUMN WITH SIERRA CLUB CALIFORNIA. CIRCLE CALIFORNIA MUST RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE AB ONE SEVENTY EIGHT THIS BILL IS A STEP BACKWARDS FROM CALIFORNIA'S ENERGY EFFICIENCY GOALS AND POLICIES. THE CDC CALIFORNIA'S ENERGY COMMISSION HAS ADOPTED BUILDING STANDARDS THAT WILL HELP REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS IT'S IMPORTANT TO UP HOLD THESE BUILDING ENERGY EFFICIENT C. STANDARDS BECAUSE THOSE STANDARDS ARE PREPARING CALIFORNIANS. TO MAKE THE NECESSARY CHANGES TO FIGHT CLIMATE CHANGE. CALIFORNIA IS FEELING THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE IN MANY WAYS INCLUDING AN INCREASING AVERAGE AIR TEMPERATURES AS WELL AS AN INCREASE IN WILD FIRES AND DROUGHTS HE'S EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS PROMPTED THE ADOPTION OF THESE BUILDING STANDARDS INCLUDING THE VOTE OF A TAKE REQUIREMENTS. ALL THESE UPDATES ARE CRITICAL TO CALIFORNIA'S OBLIGATION TO RAPIDLY DE CARBONIZED IT'S HOMES AND BUILDINGS IN RESPONSE TO CLIMATE CHANGE. WE ARE SYMPATHETIC WITH THE VICTIMS OF RECENT WILDFIRES AND RECOGNIZE THE FINANCIAL BURDEN OF REBUILDING. THE CAMPFIRE THE DEADLIEST AND MOST DESTRUCTIVE FIRE IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY ALL BUT OBLITERATED THE TOWN OF PARADISE. ON FEBRUARY TWENTY SECOND PARADISE HELD ITS FIRST IN A SERIES OF PLANNING WORKSHOPS ON REBUILDING THE INFRASTRUCTURE LOST IN THE FIRE OVER FIVE HUNDRED MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY WERE IN ATTENDANCE. THE RESIDENTS EXPRESSED ENTHUSIASM FOR REBUILDING THE TOWN EMPHASIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF IT HEARING TO CURRENT BUILDING CODES AS OF MANY OF THE NEWER DEVELOPMENTS. SURVIVE THE FIRE. THE RESIDENTS ALSO VOICED THEIR INTEREST IN EXPANDING RENEWABLE ENERGY IN THEIR TOWN IN AN EFFORT TO CREATE MORE ENERGY INDEPENDENCE AND LESS RELIANCE ON LARGE SCALE ENERGY UTILITY COMPANIES. THE RESIDENTS OF THE TOWN OF PARADISE WANT TO REBUILD. BETTER THAN BEFORE CREATING A MORE RESILIENT SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITY WAS SAFE HOMES THAT WILL STAND THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WANTING TO SPEAK AGAINST THE BILL. OKAY WITH THAT I WILL NOW TURN TO THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS ASSEMBLYMEMBER EGGS. THANK YOU BUT IN THANK YOU MISTER DALI AND WHILE I APPRECIATE THE OPPONENTS -- POSITION I ALSO HAVE VISITED THAT AREA QUITE A FEW TIMES AND SO MANY OTHER PLACES WHERE WE'VE SEEN THE DESTRUCTION OF THE WILDFIRES. AND CERTAINLY WE WANT PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO GET BACK IN HOMES AND IDEALLY THEY'VE WITH SOLAR ON THE ROOFTOP OF SOMETIMES INSURANCES DON'T QUITE. PENCIL OUT AND THAT KIND OF WAY. AND SO MASS WAS HIGHER HE WOULD SAY THAT WE PUT SOME OF OUR HIGHER ASPIRATIONAL GOALS ON THE VERY TOP ONLY KEEP THEM THERE BUT THAT WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO SURE. THAT PEOPLE HAVE A SAFE PLACE TO LIVE ALSO SO -- IS ALREADY BEEN MOVED AND SECONDED BUT I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY AND AND THANK YOU FOR FINDING A WAY TO SPREAD THAT NEEDLE TO MAKE SURE WE KEEP OUR CLIMATE GOALS IN MIND. BUT THAT WE ALSO MAKE ALLOWANCES FOR PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO GET BACK IN THEIR HOMES THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU SOME EVER SEARCHING THANK YOU VERY MUCH WITH THE THE CHAIRS INDULGENCE I WANTED TO SEE -- IF WE CAN GET THE REPRESENT FROM THE NATIONAL RESEARCH RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL BACK UP HERE ALL RIGHT. SOME IS WRONG MY I APPRECIATE. TO YOUR POINT THAT TO OVER THE LIFE OF THE HOME. THE THE ARGUMENT IS THAT. THE ARE GOING SOLAR WOULD -- BE A COST SAVINGS BUT WE WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE MEDIA READ REBUILDING HERE -- WHAT WHAT IS YOUR RESPONSE? TO YOU KNOW THE TEN THOUSAND ESTIMATED -- IMMEDIATE COSTS OF REBUILDING. IS IT OKAY IF I HAVE MY COLLEAGUE MISTER DEL FORGE SPEAK TO THAT [inaudible] SURE OF THERE ARE MANY WAYS. TO YEAH. THIS IS YOU INTRODUCE YOURSELF THE OTHER FOR THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL. THERE ARE SEVERAL WAYS IN THE BUILDING CODE TO MEET THE SOLAR REQUIREMENTS ONE OF IT IS ONE OF THOSE WAYS IS LEASING. WHERE -- THE PANELS CAN -- BECAUSE ZERO MONEY UP FRONT WAS STILL SAVING OVER THE LIFE OF THE BUILDING -- SO AT THIS FLEXIBILITY IN HOW TO ACHIEVE THAT AND IT DOESN'T THIRTY OUT COST TO THE FIRST CLOSE TO THE BUILDING. OKAY AND DO A MASCOT -- MISTER DAHLE IF YOU CAN RESPOND TO THAT. BUT I'D LOVE TO SO FIRST OFF NUMBER ONE I'M NOT -- THIS BILL IS IS ONLY REDUCING THE SOLAR MANDATE NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO WE ARE WE WANT THEM TO REBUILD A HOME THERE'S GONNA BE FIRE RESILIENT. AND SAFE THAT'S WITH THE NEW STANDARDS WE HAVE THAT. SO -- THERE ARE THERE ARE PROGRAMS -- FOR FOLKS TO BE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF BUT IT'S AT THE COST THE TAXPAYER AND ALSO I WANT TO JUST MENTION ONE THING THAT I THINK IS. THE ELEPHANT ROOM IS THAT. WE HAVE WHAT WE CALL THE DOT KIRBY MANY OF YOUR FAVORITE FROM HERE THAT THAT WERE PRODUCING MORE SOLID THAN WE ACTUALLY NEED AND WE HAVE THE VALLEY IF THEY WERE IF THERE WAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE. TO FILL IN THAT GAP AT THE BOTTOM I THINK IT WOULD BE TOTALLY PROBATE BUT AT BUT YOU REALLY NEED TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT. INSURANCE COMPANIES DON'T COVER IT THESE PEOPLE ARE STRAPPED TO TRY TO GET BACK INTO THEIR HOMES WITH THE NEW ALREADY ADDED BUILDING CENTERS THAT WE SHOULD. ENFORCE THAT MAKE THEIR HOME SAFER TO FIRE SOLAR DOES NOT DO THAT IT SIMPLY. HAD TO COST OF THEM IF THEY CHOOSE TO WANT. TO APPLY TO ONE OF THESE PROGRAMS IT AND IT FITS FOR THEM THEY'RE ABLE TO DO THAT WE ARE NOT LIMITING IT TO THAT THEY CAN'T TAKE ADVANTAGE OF A PROGRAM THAT THEY MAY WANT. TO BUT WE DON'T WANT TO FORCE THEM TO HAVE TO TAKE SOLAR WHERE IT MAY IMPACT THE COST UP FRONT FOR THEM ON THEIR HOMES OR SIMPLY JUST TRYING. TO GIVE THEM THE ABILITY. TO EITHER USED EXEMPTION OR NOT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS ASSEMBLY MEMBER MELENDEZ. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR -- MISTER DALI DO YOU TO YOUR KNOWLEDGE DO SOLAR PANELS INSTALLED ON A ROOFTOP. MAKE THE HOUSE FIRE RESISTANT. NOT TO MY KNOWLEDGE. THANK YOU SO THEN THE CONVERSATION THAT WE HAVE BEEN HEARING SO FAR OR ABOUT -- ENERGY DEPENDENCE ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND HOW IMPORTANT IT IS THAT WE HAVE HOLD THE ENERGY STANDARDS THAT CALIFORNIA IS ALREADY SET -- I DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND [inaudible] HOW? PEOPLE CAN COME IN HERE AND DISCUSS THIS WITH A STRAIGHT FACE AND NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO ARE NOW OUT OF THE HOME. YOU DON'T HAVE AN EXTRA TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS LYING AROUND OR A NICE SUIT TO WEAR TO COME IN AND TESTIFY IN A COMMITTEE TO TALK ABOUT HOW YOU CAN FINANCE SOLAR PANELS. I THINK WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT IS THAT WE GET PEOPLE BACK IN THEIR HOMES. WE CAN TALK ABOUT THE ENERGY EFFICIENCY ASPECT OF THIS ONCE PEOPLE ACTUALLY GET THEIR LIVES BACK THIS IS A VERY SMALL ASK YOU HAVE ACCEPTED COMMITTEE A COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. WHICH I I WOULD JUST SAY THAT. THESE ARE DISAPPOINTING. TO SAY THE LEAST BUT YOU HAVE TO DO WHAT YOU HAVE TO DEAL KNOW EVERYBODY HAS TO WORK TOGETHER. SO I'M GLAD YOU'RE ABLE TO DO THAT BUT WHAT IS MOST IMPORTANT RIGHT NOW IS TO GET THESE PEOPLE BACK IN THEIR HOMES. AND NOT -- NOT FOCUSED ON ENERGY REGULATIONS AND EFFICIENCIES BECAUSE FRANKLY THAT IS -- MONUMENTALLY INCONSIDERATE TO THOSE WHO HAVE LOST THEIR HOMES I'LL BE HAPPY TO SUPPORT YOUR BILL THANK THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER. COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. OKAY WITH THAT WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND. WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE SPENT LAST FOREVER [inaudible] THANK YOU. ROLL CALL PLEASE.

ONE SIXTY ONE HE SEEMS TO HAVE A VERY LARGE RECEIPT WITH HIM. WELCOME THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR -- PROUD TO THE AUTHOR AB ONE SIXTY ONE ARE SKIPPED THE SLIP BILL WHICH WILL REQUIRE STARTING IN JANUARY FIRST. TWENTY TWENTY TWO THAT THIS IS A LIFE CUSTOMERS HE RECEIVED BY DEFAULT IN PAPER RECEIPTS UPON. REQUEST OUT WE ARE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS TO CARVE OUT HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS IN THE FINE INVOICE AND PREFER PURCHASED SO. VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR TIME MADAM CHAIR AND YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF TIME. WE ALSO WORKED ON AMENDMENTS TO FIRST DO A NUMBER OF THINGS ONE IS. TO CARVE OUT CASH ONLY BUSINESSES AS WELL AS SMALL BUSINESSES WITH GROSS RECEIPTS UNDER A MILLION DOLLARS. THAT'S VERY SIMILAR TO A DEFINITION THAT WE USED IN SAN FRANCISCO TO TO FIND SMALL BUSINESSES I'M IN THE SONG BEVERLY CREDIT CARD ACT TO ALLOW CUSTOMERS TO SHERIDAN FINALLY AT THE IDENTIFIABLE. INFORMATION OR TO GET THE RECEIPT ALSO ALLOW CUSTOMERS TO RECEIVE A PAPER RECEIPT WITH FEDERAL OR STATE LAW SUPPLY. IT SHOWS THAT THE BILL DOESN'T CHANGE THE PRIVACY PROTECTIONS UNDER THE SCOPE OF THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT -- ALSO THE ECOLOGIST GENERALLY SUPPORT LAST TO THE FACT THAT WITH BPA OR P. P. S.. A AND WALLPAPER MANUFACTURES THEY ARGUE THAT THERE ARE NO LONGER USING B. P. HEY -- B. P. S. IS SEEN AS A SIMILAR. REPLACEMENT WHICH IS -- BEEN DEEMED ASKED SIMILARLY TOXIC BY WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY GENETICIST. ADDITIONALLY GREEN AMERICA COMMISSION TO STUDY WHICH FOUND THAT. OVER THREE MILLION TREES AND NINE BILLION GALLONS OF WATER IN THE U. S. IS TO CREATE. PAPER RECEIPTS -- SO THESE ARE -- TOTALLY UNNECESSARY AND IF YOU TALK TO RECYCLERS MANY RECYCLERS. HAVE DIFFICULTY RECYCLING THE PAPER RECEIPTS BECAUSE THEY ARE VERY SMALL AND THEIR SYSTEMS HAVE A DIFFICULT TIME CATCHING THEM. ALSO FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE THROWING THE RECEIPT IN THE COMPOST -- THESE RECEIPTS ARE NOT COMPOSTABLE BECAUSE OF THE PPA AND THE PPS CHEMICALS THROUGH ARE ACTUALLY REAL WINNING YOUR COMPOST ON THE OPPOSITION WILL ALSO TALK ABOUT HOW THE RECEIPTS ARE RENEWABLE BECAUSE TREES ARE RENEWABLE. AND BY RENEWABLE THEY MEAN BY WHAT YOU CUT THE TREES YOU CAN REPLANT THEM AND THAT'S THEIR DEFINITION OF RENEWABLE WHICH I I DISAGREE WITH SO. WITH THAT WE HAVE TO WITNESSES. VERY MUCH WE APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT FOR AB. ONE SIXTY ONE THANK YOU AND THE WITNESSES AND PAPER HAVE. TWO MINUTES APIECE. I GOT TEN O'CLOCK THIS OF CALIFORNIANS AGAINST WASTE. WE'RE HERE IN SUPPORT FOR A COUPLE SIMPLE REASONS. CALIFORNIA'S RECYCLING SYSTEM IS REALLY AT A CROSSROADS FOR THE LAST THIRTY YEARS WE RELY ON OVERSEAS MARKETS TO TAKE ALL OF OUR RECYCLABLES. AS CHINA AND OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE SAID THAT THEY NO LONGER WANT TO TAKE THAT THAT CONTAMINANTS THAT WE SEND ALONG WITH OUR RECYCLABLES. MANY CITIES ARE FORCED TO RETHINK ABOUT -- RETHINK WHAT THEY ARE COLLECTING IN THEIR SYSTEMS. AND IT REALLY IS FORCING US TO THE STATE TO RETHINK OUR WHOLE RECYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE. PART OF THAT IS FOCUSING ON THE FIRST ARE IN THE THREE R'S AND THAT'S REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF WASTE WE GENERATE. IF FOR LOOKING AT REDUCING WASTE PROBABLY THE EASIEST THING WE CAN DO IS GET RID OF THE THE MATERIALS THAT SOMEBODY HANDS TO US THAT WE DON'T WANT. THAT WE HOLD ON TO UNTIL WE GET TO NEXT TRASH CAN AND THROW AWAY -- THIS BILL DOES NOT PANDER SEATS IT JUST SAYS THE RECEIPTS MUST BE PROVIDED ONLY TO THOSE WHO ACTUALLY WANT THEM WHICH IS A VERY COMMON SENSE MOVE. THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS I'M BILL ALLEY -- WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL WORKING GROUP -- THIS BILL THERE'S A HEALTH ISSUE HERE AND IT'S BEEN DOUBLE REFER BUT NOT TO HEALTH COMMITTEE AND I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE TO QUICKLY ADDRESS THAT HERE -- THESE RECEIPTS HAVE BISCAYNE ALL A OR BISCAYNE ALL ELSE IN THEM IT FOR A WHILE WE WERE SAYING BPA FREE RECEIPTS IT TURNS OUT THAT BE PS. MUCH LIKE DRINKING WATER BOTTLES NOW SAY BPA FREE MOST OF THEM HAVE BE PS ARE BISCAYNE ALL ELSE. BUT SCIENCE IS SHOWING US THAT BPA HAS REALLY NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON PREGNANT FOR PREGNANT WOMEN FETUSES AND ADULTS -- AND SOMETHING LIKE 90% OF AMERICANS THAT BP AND THEIR URINE WE WERE ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE TO LEGISLATURE IN TWENTY ELEVEN THE THE DAMAGING IMPACTS OF THE PA AND THEY'VE VOTED TO BAN PPA IN BABY BOTTLES. THAT WAS SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR -- BE PS MAY BE JUST AS BAD IT MAY BE HOLDING YOUR BODY LAST TIME THAT A STRONGER ESTROGENIC EFFECTS. ON OVER 80% OF AMERICANS THAT BP ASSN THEIR URINE AND SO THERE ARE HORMONAL EFFECTS OF SUSHI WITH THIS WE THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO NOT HAVE PEOPLE TOUCHING. THEM ESPECIALLY CASHIERS UP ALL DAY A CONTACT WITH THESE RECEIPTS THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF THE BILL [inaudible] THANK YOU -- OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. OF THE DID RECEIVE COALITION. INCLUDING COMPANIES OF CALM CASH AND RECEIVE ME IN SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON JAMIE GO ON BEHALF OF A SOUL IN SUPPORT. THERESA BROKERAGE ON BEHALF OF SAVE OUR SHORES AND SURFRIDER FOUNDATION SUPPORT. GENEVIEVE EVAN ON BEHALF OF SEVEN GENERATION ADVISERS IN PLASTIC POLLUTION COALITION IN SUPPORT. READ A MONSTER DO NOT A WITH THE TRUST FOR PUBLIC LAND IN SUPPORT. FOR CALLING THE SIERRA CLUB CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. AND ONLY SERVER -- DEFENDERS OF WILDLIFE IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. READ OUT AS WITH BREAST CANCER PREVENTION PARTNERS IN SUPPORT THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. OTHER WITNESSES HERE TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION. AND AGAIN THREE WITNESSES WITH TWO MINUTES APIECE. OR FOR WITNESSES WITH SIX MINUTES BETWEEN YOU. OTHER FOR WITNESSES ARE. THREE THREE OKAY -- THREE HI MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS MET CERTAIN THE CALIFORNIA RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION WE ARE IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL -- WE BELIEVE THAT PROPOSING A MANDATORY ELECTRONIC OR SEEN AS THE DEFAULT TRANSACTION AS A RECORD BETWEEN THE CONSUMER IN THE BUSINESS IT COMES WITH UNIQUE IMPACTS FOR THE RESTAURANT COMMUNITY. IT MAY SEEM THAT THESE ELECTRONIC RECEIPTS ARE SUPER COMMON PLACE AND THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT SOME RESTAURANTS USE THEM IN SOME BUSINESSES USE THEM. BUT THEY ARE NOT WIDESPREAD AND IT DOESN'T CHANGE WITH THE FLIP OF A SWITCH THERE'S A LOT THAT GOES ON THE BACK AND IT'S QUITE COSTLY. SO I JUST WANT TO BRIEFLY WALK YOU THROUGH THAT. A LITTLE BIT IS CERTAINLY A LOT OF THE GOAL TO GO -- AND ADDRESS PAPER WASTE BUT THIS COMES WITH A LOT OF FINANCIAL COST LOGISTICAL HURDLES -- AND SOME CONSUMER PRIVACY IMPACTS THAT WE WANTED TO ADDRESS HERE TODAY -- MOST BUSINESSES THROUGHOUT THE STATE ARE USING SOME SORT OF POINT OF SALE SYSTEM. NOT ALL POINT OF SALE SYSTEMS ARE EQUIPPED NOW TO DEAL WITH ELECTRONIC RECEIPTS AND SO WHAT IT OFTEN REQUIRES IS A SOFTWARE UPGRADE OR A FULL CHANGEOVER OF A POINT OF SALE SYSTEM AND THE NUMBERS THAT WE KEEP HEARING. FROM INDEPENDENT RESTAURANTS OR SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN THE THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND AND FORTY THOUSAND DOLLAR LEVEL TO EITHER DO THE SOFT GRADE OR MORE EXPENSIVELY TO SWAP OUT THE POINT OF SALE SYSTEM. SO THE BOTTOM LINE IS THE WAY THIS BILL IS STRUCTURED I KNOW IT'S BEEN SAID IT MANY TIMES THAT IT'S IT'S IT'S AN OPTION. OUT OF THE GATE IT'S A MANDATE THAT YOU HAVE TO PROVIDE AN AVENUE FOR THE ELECTRONIC RECEIPT THAT'S WHERE THE COST IMPLICATIONS COMMON RESTAURANTS. AT THE SAME TIME YOU CONTINUE TO OFFER THE SAME LANE THAT YOU HAVE NOW WHICH IS THE TRADITIONAL PAPER RECEIPT SO IT IS A MANDATE TO GO DOWN THAT ROAD OF UPGRADING YOUR SOFTWARE IN YOUR LACK CONICS WHICH AGAIN COMES AT GREAT COST. IT COMES AT GREAT COST TO INDEPENDENT RESTAURANTS AND EVEN IF YOU'RE IN A FRANCHISE MODEL THAT FRANCHISE IS TREATED AS AN INDIVIDUAL BUSINESS BY THE CORPORATION IN MANY CASES SO THOSE COSTS ARE BORNE. BY THE INDIVIDUAL FRANCHISEE OR FRANCHISE OR LOGISTICS IF YOU IMAGINE A FAST PACE RESTAURANT ENVIRONMENT WITH A FAST CASUAL OR A QUICK SERVICE TYPE RESTAURANT. NOW WE'RE GOING TO ASK THAT EACH TRANSIT ACTS EACH TRANSACTION TAKE MORE TIME BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO BE ASKING -- FOR EMAIL OR CELL PHONE INFORMATION OR SOME PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION TO GET SOMEONE ELECTRONIC RECEIPT. THAT'S GOT LOGISTICAL AND OPERATIONAL PROBLEMS FOR FOR US ON OUR END AND CERTAINLY NEGATIVELY IMPACTS THE GUEST EXPERIENCE. THE ISSUE APPEARS TO BE DRIVEN BY PAPER WASTES AND THE STAFF ANALYSIS ALSO SUGGESTS. THAT PAPER WASTE FROM THIS FRONT IS NOT. DETECTABLE IN CALIFORNIA NOT NOT QUANTIFIABLE AS IT RELATES TO PAPER RECEIPTS THE OTHER ISSUE THAT CONTINUES TO COME UP IS CHEMICALS. AND SO I GUESS WE'RE LEFT ASKING IN RESTAURANTS ON THE GROUND -- LEFT ASKING WHY CAN'T WE USE TRADITIONAL RECEIPTS AS AN OPTION THAT DON'T HAVE THE CHEMICALS IN QUESTION. THAT'S A FAIR QUESTION. OTHERWISE WE THINK THAT THIS MANDATE IMPOSES COSTS ON US -- CREATE SOME PRIVACY CONCERNS FOR OUR CUSTOMERS AND ALSO NEGATIVELY IMPACTS THE GUEST EXPERIENCE IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS SO WITH THAT WE ARE OPPOSE THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE CATHOLICS REPRESENTING AMERICAN FOREST AND PAPER ASSOCIATION HERE IN OPPOSITION. REPRESENTING THE U. S. MANUFACTURERS AND IMPORTERS OF RECEIPT PAPER -- WE ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT SOME OF THE MISLEADING AND I'M SUBSTANTIATED STATEMENTS ABOUT PAPER RECEIPTS PAPER RECEIPTS ARE MADE FROM FIBER SOURCE FROM SUSTAINABLY MANAGED FORESTS AND ARE RECYCLABLE. RESPONSIBLE SOURCING OF TREE FIBER THREE SUSTAINABLE FOREST MANAGEMENT PRACTICE CONTRIBUTES TO MITIGATING CLIMATE CHANGE. THROUGH CARBON SEQUESTRATION OF PROMOTE SPORES BIODIVERSITY. SHOULD MARKETS FOR PAPER DRY UP THERE'S A VERY STRONG LIKELIHOOD THAT THE FOREST LAND WOULD BE CONVERTED INTO URBAN DEVELOPMENT. THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF PAPER SEAT USAGE WRITTEN AND AB ONE SIXTY ONE TAKE TAKEN DIRECTLY FROM A REPORT BY GREEN AMERICA DEMONSTRABLY FLAWED. THEIR ASSERTIONS ARE SPECULATIVE. THEIR CLAIMS ARE BASED ON DATA FROM OUTSIDE NORTH AMERICA AND THE METHODOLOGY FOR CALCULATING WATER USE WASTE AND GREENHOUSE GAS IS NOT PEER REVIEWED. OR ACCEPTED BY THE LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT COMMUNITY AND SHOULD NOT BE IN STRIDE AND TO CALIFORNIA ON RECEIPTS CONTRARY TO SPEECH IS A CLAIMS ARE FULLY RECYCLABLE. COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE U. S. COLLECTIVE RECEIPT PAPER FOR RECYCLING WE'VE SURVEYED ALL OF OUR MILLS REGARDING THIS. NEW YORK CITY FOR EXAMPLE RECYCLES ON ALL THEIR PAPER RECEIPTS THEY CAN BE RECYCLED THE SAME AS MAGAZINE CATALOGS MAILING OFFICE PAPER. THE HEALTH CONCERNS ABOUT EXPOSURE TO PAPER RECEIPTS IS UNFOUNDED. US PRODUCERS DO NOT USE BPA IN THE MANUFACTURING OF RECEIPT PAPER AND THE MAJOR IMPORTERS DO NOT IMPORT PAPERS THAT USE BPA COATINGS. SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE SUPPORTS THAT EXPOSURE TO BE PA THROUGH RECEIPTS IS WITHIN THE PROP SIXTY FIVE SAFE HARBOR THRESHOLD. CHEMICAL EXPOSURE AND SAFETY REQUIRE VERY FACTUALLY INTENSIVE IN SCIENCE BASED QUESTIONS WHICH IS WHY WE HAVE THE GREEN CHEMISTRY PROGRAM AND PROP. SIXTY FIVE IN CLOSING -- FROM YOU HEARD FROM THE RESTAURANTS THE PAPER RECEIPTS -- SHOULD BE LEFT OPTIONAL AND A CHOICE BETWEEN RETAILERS AND CONSUMERS. AND AS MISTER SUTTON -- MENTIONED THAT THE ANALYSIS DOES POINT OUT THAT YOU DO NOT HAVE CALIFORNIA SPECIFIC DATA I WOULD JUST OFFER. THAT THE PAPER INDUSTRY IN ITS TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN DATA ON A PAPER RECOVERY U. S. WIDE WAS AROUND 66%. PAPERS ONE OF THE MATERIALS THAT REALLY IS WALKING THE WALK IN TERMS OF RECOVERING ITS MATERIAL YOUR TIME TO STAND AND WE WOULD JUST ARGUE THAT IF YOU WERE COVERED ALL THE RECEIPT PAPER YOU'D BE RECOVERING ZERO POINT THINK THANK YOU LAST WITNESS. I AM RENTAL BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA GROWERS ASSOCIATION. TAKE A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT -- POSITION WE ARE OPPOSE WAS AMENDED -- PERFORMING A THANK AS A MEMBER TING AND HIS STAFF -- FOR SUGGESTION THE AMENDMENT ABOUT THE FEDERAL REGULATIONS BECAUSE WE HAVE CUSTOMERS WHO -- EXCEPT PUBLIC BENEFITS THAT WE CAN'T THAT WE HAVE PROVIDED PAPER SEE -- FOR WE WOODS -- HUMBLY ASKED THAT -- GROCERS BE EXEMPT FROM THE BILL AND THE REASON IS THIS -- AS YOUR CALL NUMBER OF YEARS AGO -- WE CHOSE -- TO PART WITH LEGISLATURE. TO ELIMINATE THESE OF SINGLE USE PLASTIC BAGS -- DID A GREAT JOB THE RHYME A GETTING WASTE OUT OF THE OUT OF THE WASTE STREAM BUT WHAT THAT HAS DONE IS BASICALLY -- MADE IT HARDER FOR US TO DISCERN WHO HAS OR HASN'T BOUGHT -- GOOD AT OUR STORES -- YOU GO TO A A REGULAR RETAIL STORE MACY'S ARE AT NORDSTROM YOU GET A BAG WHEN YOU GO OUT SO IF YOU HAVE A A PAPERLESS RECEIPT IT'S EASY TO SAY. WHO'S BOUGHT SOMETHING WHO HASN'T HAD A RESTORE HOWEVER BECAUSE AT PEOPLE EITHER BRING YOUR OWN BAG MAYBE THEY WALK OUT WITH A WITH US -- CART CARRIED OUT OF THEM ON THEIR OWN -- WE NEED THAT RECEIPT TO BE ABLE TO CHECK TO SEE WHO HAS OR HASN'T BOUGHT SOMETHING -- AND WHILE WE UNDERSTAND THAT THAT THAT CAN BE DONE WITH A ELECTRONIC RECEIPT. THE ONLY -- THING WITH THAT IS THAT THERE MAY BE IN SAYS WERE SOMEONE DOESN'T HAVE A CELL PHONE WITH THEM. THEY MAY BE SITUATION WHERE THE RECEIPT DOESN'T ARRIVE IN A TIMELY MANNER SO EVEN IF SOMEBODY -- WENT AND SECURITY SAID HEY CAN AS YOUR RECEIPT THAT MAY NOT HAPPEN WITH THEM IN A TIMELY MANNER WHICH LEADS TO DELAYS -- SO AGAIN WE THINK THE PAPER SEAT AT LEAST FOR GROCERY STORES BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE BAGS THAT ARE EASILY IDENTIFIABLE WE JUST WOULD HUMBLY ASKED THAT -- BECAUSE OF THAT THAT WE WERE TAKEN OUT OF THE BILL -- HOPE TO WORK WITH THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER TO STAFF ON ON THAT POSSIBLY BUT JUST FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE -- THAT'S OUR POSITION AND AGAIN WE'RE OPPOSE US MANY BECAUSE I KNOW THE AND HOUSES AS A POST SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

AND I KNOW IT IS IN SAN FRANCISCO WE DON'T REALLY HAVE A CLEAR DEFINITION HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE WE'VE SEEN LOTS OF DIFFERENT THINGS OUT THERE. I'M NOT SURE. IF IT'S THE BEST DEFINITION I'M STILL GOING TO BE VOTING FOR THE BILL BUT I DO THINK WE NEED TO REVISIT THAT I WAS SEEING A LITTLE BIT OF QUICK MATH -- BEFORE I CAME IN AND I THINK ABOUT COMMUNITIES LIKE SOUTH LA WHERE THEY HAVE LITTLE MARKETS. AND I LOOK AT GROSS RECEIPTS THEY MIGHT BE HITTING CLOSE TO THAT ONE MILLION DOLLAR ON DOWN PROBABLY DON'T HAVE THE WIFI IN THERE AND SO FORTH AND SO. I JUST WANT US. TO CONTINUE TO PLAY WITH THE COMMISSION. ALONG THE WAY AND SITS WANTED TO MAKE THAT STATEMENT. THANK YOU WILL.

AND I AND IN OUR CONVERSATION I SAID I LIKE BY SAID NOPE NO THANK YOU NO THANK YOU TO THAT RECEIPTS BUT I'M ALSO IN A LOT OF STORES IN MY DISTRICT THAT. DON'T SOMETIMES DON'T THE INTERNET'S DOWN THEY DON'T HAVE IT AND AS MS GARCIA SAID. THEY COULD BE DOING A MILLION DOLLARS BECAUSE ARE CASHING PAYCHECK TO DOING ALL KINDS OF THINGS OUT THERE. SO I LOOK FORWARD TO IN THE FUTURE AS WE CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS OF GET GETTING CLOSER BUT I APPRECIATE WORK ON IT. BUT WILL PEOPLE SUPPORT TODAY. THANK YOU MISTER MAYOR CITY THANK YOU. MISTER CHANG I APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR GOAL WITH THIS BILL -- I WE DO WANT TO ASK YOU IF YOU CAN RESPOND TO SOME OF THE CONCERNS RAISED FIRST BY THE THE GROCERS ASSOCIATION AND I'M THINKING. WHENEVER I SHOP AT COSTCO I'M ALWAYS WALKING OUT THE DOOR WITH THAT MY OF MY RECEIPTS. COULD COULD YOU RESPOND. TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF THEIR BUSINESSES YEAH I HAVE HAPPY TO I THINK -- AGAIN IT'S THE RECEIPTS AS THE DEFAULT WITH PAPER SEATS AS A AS AN OPTION. WHAT WE WILL BE BELIEVE IS THAT IF YOU DO WALK OUT? WITH YOUR PHONE MOST OF US HAVE OURPHONE WITH US YOU GET THE RECEIPT ON YOUR PHONE THE RECEIPTS JUST THERE TO VERIFY PURCHASE LIKE MISTER MARINO TALKED ABOUT. SO WE THINK IT'S EASILY DONE ON THE PHONE AS WELL AS WITH THE PAPER SEE. OKAY AND THEN -- AYE AYE AYE. HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE IMPACT ON THE VERY SMALL BIZ BUSINESS. YOU KNOW I I KNOW THAT WERE. COMFORTABLE LUG ON GOING ACROSS THE STREET TO CHICORY AND AND AND YOU KNOW HOW THEY THEY THEY SEEM TO HAVE THAT DEVICE READILY AVAILABLE WERE -- YOU KNOW YOU YOU CAN ASK FOR THE RECEIPT HEARD OR OR NOT BUT I MEAN. HOW EXPENSIVE OR INEXPENSIVE IS THAT TECHNOLOGY THAT THE YOU CAN SEE MANY SMALL BUSINESSES HAVE ALREADY MOVED TO THIS TECHNOLOGY BECAUSE PROBABLY IN THE LONG RUN? CHEAPER ON THEIR BOTTOM LINE -- MUCH OF THE NEWER TECHNOLOGIES ACTUALLY COME IN LESS EXPENSIVE THAN SOME OF THE OLDER OR LEGACY TECHNOLOGY THAT MANY SYSTEMS HAVE BEEN IN PLACE WHICH IS WHY YOU FRANKLY I'VE SEEN. SO MANY SMALL BUSINESSES I DO WITH IT TO GET THE TRADITIONAL QUITE A CREDIT CARD SWIPE OR MACHINES FROM THE BANKS WAS YOU KNOW QUITE QUITE COSTLY SAID. THESE THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY HAPPENS TO BE LESS EXPENSIVE IN MY OPINION NOW. HAVING SAID THAT -- MANY SMALL BUSINESSES THAT JUST THEY HAVE A CERTAIN HABIT OF DOING BUSINESS A CERTAIN WAY SO WHAT WE'VE TRIED TO DO IS FIND A DEFINITION SOME NOT TO BE A BURDEN -- TO SMALL BUSINESS BUT AS YOU CAN SEE MANY SMALL BUSINESSES EVEN WITHIN WALKING DISTANCE FROM THE COUPLE HAVE ALREADY MOVED IN THIS DIRECTION I THINK. A LOT OF IT IS REALLY JUST BASED ON COMFORT WITH TECHNOLOGY ONCE THEY MOVE IN THIS DIRECTION THEY FIND OUT IT'S ACTUALLY INCREDIBLY EASY TO USE SO THEY ACTUALLY -- HAVE MAY HAVE A BREAST [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU A SOME EVER MATHIS. THANK YOU MANAGER. MISTER CHANG. LOOK AT YOU YOU KNOW I'M A RURAL GUY. AND THEN TELL WE GET ROLE BROADBAND GO AND I'M IN A LOT OF MY SMALLER BUSINESSES -- SOMEONE MURDER FEED STORES SO I HAVE THE SAME CONCERNS -- MISS GARCIA HAS WITH -- YOU KNOW TECH TALKING ABOUT THE THE GROSS INCOME OF A MILLION DOLLARS BECAUSE IF YOU EVER BOND HEY IT GOES A LOT MORE THAN THAT REALLY QUICK -- ESPECIALLY IN CELLS IN THESE PLACES BUT A LOT OF THESE GUYS I MEAN. THEY'RE USING DIAL UP INTERNET. DID JUST TO DO THE CREDIT CARDS FLIPPER MACHINE. AND WHEN THAT GOES OUT IN IN THEIR DOING OTHER THINGS I MEAN. THIS MIGHT WORK GRAY IN. THE BAY AREA OR IN LA OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT BUT IF YOU'RE ON THE COUNTRY LIKE ME. IT'S NOT AN OPTION BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE ROLE BROADBAND YET -- WE DON'T HAVE THE FIVE G. YET WE WE DON'T HAVE THOSE THINGS WOULD BE NICE. WE DON'T HAVE AND IT'S THE REST OF THE STAGE JUST NOT THERE -- MAY AND I UNDERSTAND I APPRECIATE THE CALL IN AN OPTION. BUT A I THINK YOU KNOW SOMETIMES THE THINGS THAT WERE GOOD AND ARE YOU KNOW BIGGER CITIES DON'T NECESSARILY WORK. IN THE COUNTRYSIDE OF A LOT OF CONCERNS THERE -- THERE ONE OTHER CONCERN THAT. THEIR RAISED -- A BROW FOR ME -- TALKING ABOUT WITH WITH THE CHEMICALS WITH THIS -- BPA B. P. S. MIGHT MIGHT THE THOUGHT THE POP IN MY HEAD IS IS THAT IN ALL THOSE NEW PAPER STRAWS THAT WE ALL HAVE NOW. NO NO NO I DON'T I TO MANUFACTURE I'M JUST YOU KNOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PAVE RECEIVES PAPER STRAWS SO. THIS RAISES THE QUESTION. ANYWAY IN IN INTEL I CAN LOOK AT THIS IS BEING A VIABLE OPTION FOR RURAL DISTRICTS AYE I CAN'T SUPPORT. NO PRESSURE YOUR COMMENTS AND WE'D BE HAPPY -- TO AGAIN IT CAN TO WORK WITH YOU AND FIGURE OUT HOW. HOW THIS COULD -- COULD WORK IN YOUR IN YOUR PART OF THE DISTRICT. THANK YOU SOME MEMORABLE ONE DOES. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MISTER TING -- CAN I JUST ASK. YOUR GOAL OBVIOUSLY IS TO REDUCE WASTE WHICH IS IT THAT'S A GOOD THING BUT GIVEN THE OPPOSITION IN THE COMMENTS THAT YOU'VE HEARD TODAY WHICH I'M SURE YOU'VE HEARD THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS. MAY I ASK WHAT YOUR OPPOSITION IS TO ALLOWING -- THE MARKETS TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT THEY WANT TO GO PAPERLESS WHICH AS YOU STATED MANY STORES HAVE DONE ALREADY I'M JUST CURIOUS. WHY YOU THINK THE STATE SHOULD MANDATE RATHER THAN ALLOWING -- BUSINESSES TO IMPLEMENT THAT THEMSELVES -- I THINK IT'S A FAIR POINT. WHILE WE'VE SEEN INTERESTING ENOUGH ADOPTION AND A MORE LOCAL SMALL BUSINESS LEVEL YOU REALLY HAVEN'T SEEN ADOPTION. OF MUCH BROADER LEVEL SO -- IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT THE THE COMPANIES OR THE ENTITIES WITH FRANKLY THE MOST MEANS IN THE THIS. NEW THEORY WITH THE MOST SOPHISTICATED TECHNOLOGY -- REALLY HAVEN'T DONE IN MY OPINION THEIR PART TO REALLY MOVE IN THIS DIRECTION. OKAY THAT THAT'S A FAIR ENOUGH POINT -- I WILL JUST SAY THAT. FOR ME AS A CONSUMER I WANT -- I JUST WOULD PREFER THAT WE ALLOW BUSINESSES TO MAKE THIS DECISION WHETHER THAT'S GOOD FOR THEIR COMPANY'S BOTTOM LINE OR THAT SOMETHING THAT THEIR CUSTOMERS ARE CALLING FOR I THINK WE SHOULD LET THEM MAKE THOSE DECISIONS. I DON'T DISAGREE WITH. YOU ON THE FACT THAT YOU KNOW SIX FOOT LONG RECEIPT IS KIND OF RIDICULOUS BUT BUT I KNOW THAT THIS BILL IS ALSO GOING TO THE PRIVACY COMMITTEE WHICH IS PROBABLY WERE MORE OF MY CONCERNS ARE. JUST IN THAT I'M THINKING OF CERTAIN FAMILY MEMBERS OF MINE WHO WOULD HAVE GREAT DIFFICULTY. IN -- GETTING A RECEIPT LIKE THIS ELECTRONICALLY OR EVEN BEING ABLE TO FIND IT NOT TO MENTION THOSE WHO ARE CATEGORIZING THE RECEIPTS FOR TAX PURPOSES -- I MEAN THERE'S PLENTY OF APPS AND AND SOFTWARE NOW TO DO THAT FOR US BUT NOT EVERYONE IS. IS LIKE US YOU KNOW WITH THE YOU CAN YOU CAN MOVE THROUGH OUR FUNDS AT OUR COMPUTERS VERY QUICKLY SO -- SO FOR THAT REASON THOUGH I'M WITH YA ON THAT YOU KNOW LESS LESS PAPER THOUGH TREES ARE IT IS YOUR PAPERS RENEWABLE SOURCE -- WE WANT TO DE YOU KNOW REFOREST -- SO THAT'S A GOOD THING BUT I'M WITH YOU ON GETTING ON THE WAYS BUT I'M FORCE I CAN'T BE WITH YOU IN THE BILL TODAY THANK YOU THANK YOU. IT AGAIN FOR FOR YOUR FAMILY MEMBERS FRIENDS WHO WANT RECEIPTS FOR TAX PURPOSES OF SPECIFIC REASONS. OBVIOUSLY DOT THAT'S WHAT'S ABSOLUTELY ALLOWABLE. WHAT WE DON'T WANT IS YOUR IN THE COFFEE SHOP IN THE RECEIPT GETS PRINTED YOU YOU HAVE NO NO NEED FOR THAT? THE RECEIPT IN THE COFFEE SHOP COULD NOT RETURN THE COFFEE -- SO AGAIN IN THOSE KINDS OF CIRCUMSTANCES WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT OKAY DO WE CAN WE CAN WE REALLY -- NOT HAVE THAT PAPER WASTE YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN I'VE BEEN IN SITUATIONS WHERE AS MY COLLEGES DOCTORS THAT YOU SAY NO RECEIPTS BUT WHAT THEY DO IS THEY PUT THE RECEIPT OUT NO RECEIPT OKAY THEY TAKE IN THE THIRD WAY. SO AGAIN -- WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE MUCH MORE MONEY. SAYS AND I'M. MY CONCERN IS THAT I NOW IT'S OPTIONAL. IN MAYBE IN A COUPLE OF YEARS IT'S NOT OPTIONAL ANYMORE THAN WE SEE THE BILL THAT SAYS OKAY NOW IT'S MANDATORY AND THAT. IS CAN WHEN WE SEE THAT HAPPEN ALL THE TIME IN THE LEGISLATURE WE START OFF WITH THE GOOD IDEA WITH GREAT INTENTIONS AND THEN WE SEE IT MORPH INTO SOMETHING ELSE DOWN THE ROAD NOT SAYING THAT THAT YOUR INTENTION -- BUT THAT GIVES ME PAUSE BUT BUT THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS. THANK YOU I'LL JUST MAKE A COMMENT THAT I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR WORKING SO HARD I'M TRYING TO GET THE POLICY OF THIS RIGHT I THINK IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT GOAL. AND I'M CERTAINLY GONNA SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY AND I DO HOPE THAT YOU CONTINUE TO WORK ON SOME OF THESE ISSUES AND ESPECIALLY THE PRIVACY ISSUE WHICH I THINK -- YOU KNOW GIVEN THE CHANGING LANDSCAPE OF PRIVACY IT'S A IT'S IT'S IT'S ALMOST UNFAIR TO ASK YOU TO RESPOND TO A BILL THAT HASN'T BEEN IMPLEMENTED YET. BUT I DO HEAR SOME LEGITIMATE CONCERNS SO WITH THAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. AGAIN THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE COMMENTS FOR ALL ALL YOUR WORK AT THE COMMITTEES WORK ON THIS BILL AGAIN. THIS IS THIS BILL THERE -- FIRST COMMITTEE BILL WE REALLY VERY MUCH APPRECIATE ALL THE COMMENTS -- FROM BOTH THE OPPOSITION AS WELL AS ALL THE ALL THE MEMBERS HE WIPES THE BE TAKEN THAT FEEDBACK ON THE TO THE NEXT. THANK YOU. WITH THAT -- TO HAVE A MOTION SO. WITH A SECOND AGAIN THE MOTION A SECOND WE HAVE A ROLL CALL PLEASE. ITEM TO AB ONE SIXTY ONE BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHIANG. THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO REFER TO PRIVACY AND CONSUMER PROTECTION COMMITTEE. MEMBERS FRIEDMAN AYE FRIEDMAN AYE FLORA. FLORA NO CHILD [inaudible] EGGMAN. EGGMAN NOT VOTING. GARCIA AYE GARCIA AYE LIMóN MATHIS. MATHIS NO MCCARTY. MELENDEZ MULLIN HAS NO RIGHT TO TREAT HIGH MURATSUCHI AYE STONE. THREE THREE OKAY WILL HOLD THE BILL OPEN -- FOR ABSENT MEMBERS THANK YOU I'M GONNA HAVE -- TO TAKE A BRIEF -- I'M HAVE TO ESCAPE FOR A FEW MINUTES TO GO TO OTHER COMMITTEE NOW LIVE FOR INTEREST. SOMEONE OBERNOLTE. FILE ITEM FOURTEEN BILL NUMBER. THREE NINETY FOUR MOVE THE BILL SECOND. THANKS FOR BEING [inaudible] JOHN. STRUGGLING WHENEVER YOU'RE READY I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I WANT TO START BY THANKING. CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN FOR HER. WORK ON THE BILL ALSO THE COMMITTEE STAFF HAS BEEN ABSOLUTELY GREAT. I IT WILL BE ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN PREFERRED AND THERE'S BEEN LOCKED UP THIS MORNING I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE A CHANCE TO TO REVIEW THEM -- I'VE REVIEWED THEM THEY'RE ACCEPTABLE AND THAT THEY MAKE THE BILL BETTER. AB THREE NINETY FOUR IS A RESPONSE TO THE DEVASTATING WILDFIRES HAVE BEEN OCCURRING IN CALIFORNIA RECENTLY AND I'M SURE EVERY MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE IS AWARE OF THE SEVERITY OF THE CAMPFIRE LAST YEAR THAT WAS THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE IN THE DEADLIEST FIRE IN CALIFORNIA STATE HISTORY WAS ALSO. THE COSTLIEST NATURAL DISASTER IN THE ENTIRE WORLD LAST YEAR COST OVER SIXTEEN BILLION DOLLARS OF LIABILITY AND THAT'S STILL GOING TO CONTINUE INCREASE OVER EIGHTEEN THOUSAND STRUCTURES LOST BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY EIGHTY SIX LIVES WERE LOST IN THAT FIRE. THE DEADLIEST FIRE IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY. I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY LAST MONTH TO VISIT THE DEVASTATED TOWN OF PARADISE I'M I KNOW A NUMBER OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS WERE ALONG ON THAT LEGISLATIVE TRIP AND I'LL TELL YOU IT WAS SO. EMOTIONALLY AFFECTING TO SEE THE DEVASTATION OF THAT COMMUNITY. WE HAVE PRESENTATIONS FROM A LOT OF THE FIRST RESPONDERS THAT WERE PARTICULARLY POIGNANT BECAUSE THESE WERE FIRST RESPONDERS THAT ALSO LIVED IN THE COMMUNITIES THEY WERE HAVING RESPOND TO A DISASTER THAT. INCLUDED THEIR OWN HOUSE HOMES IN TOWN BEING DESTROYED. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS AMAZING ABOUT THAT FIRE IS THAT THE BEHAVIOR OF THE FIRE WAS NOTHING LIKE. WE HAVE EVER SEEN IN CALIFORNIA IF YOU READ SOME OF THE CAL FIRE REPORTS THEY COMPARE THE SPREAD OF THAT FIRE. TO THE FIRE BOMBING OF HAMBURG IN WORLD WAR TWO IT WAS NOT LIKE A WILDFIRE. IN IN BEHAVIOR AT ALL IN FACT THE MAJORITY OF THE STRUCTURES THE BURNED. WERE BURNED BEFORE IT WITHIN FOUR HOURS OF THE ADDITION OF THAT FIRE. SO THAT REALLY BRINGS UP. A REALLY A A VERY IMPORTANT TOPIC FOR US FROM A POLICY STANDPOINT WHICH IS THE TOPIC OF THE IF EGRESS FROM THESE FIRES BECAUSE WHEN THE FIRE SPREAD SO QUICKLY AND SO DESTRUCTIVELY -- IT'S IT'S IMPOSSIBLE WITH A CONVENTIONAL STRATEGIES TO GET PEOPLE OUT OF THE PATH OF THE FIRE. SO LAST YEAR. CHAIRWOMAN FRIEDMAN HAD A BILL THAT ASKED THE BOARD OF FORESTRY TO IDENTIFY COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA WITH INSUFFICIENT EGRESS THIS BILL IS KIND OF A FOLLOW UP TO THAT BILL IT CREATES A VERY NARROWLY CRAFTED. CRAFTED SEQUEL EXEMPTION FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THOSE PROJECTS THAT WERE RECOMMENDED BY THE BOARD IN THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE TAKING TODAY EVEN FURTHER NARROW THE SCOPE. OF THAT BILL SO WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL ARE JOHN KENNEDY FROM THE RURAL COUNTIES REPRESENT IT'S OF CALIFORNIA AND ALSO DON TRAP THE CHIEF OF THE SAN MATTEO COUNTY FIRE DEPARTMENT. ARE YOUR FIRST WITNESS JUST A REMINDER TO MISS PER WITNESS PLEASE SIX MINS TOTAL. GET A GOOD AFTERNOON ON BEHALF OF SEMINAL COUNTY. THE CALIFORNIA THIRTIES ASSOCIATION AND FIRE DISTRICT ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA PLEASE TO TESTIFY THIS AFTERNOON IN SUPPORT OF AB. THREE NINETY FOUR THE LEGISLATION FOR YOU WOULD EXEMPT FROM C. QUIT URGENT SAFETY PROJECTS IN FIRE PRONE SUBDIVISIONS WITHIN SUFFICIENT ESCAPE ROUTES. THE SALMON IN A COUNTY FIRE PROTECTION DISTRICT PROTECTS THE COUNTY THE POPULATION OF OVER TWO MILLION RESIDENTS. WE PROTECT NINETEEN THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND NINETY THREE SQUARE MILES THROUGH A COMBINATION OF SIXTY FIVE DIFFERENT FACILITIES. AND ELEVEN HUNDRED EMPLOYEES OUR GOALS A SERVE OUR SHIN AND OFFER PROFESSIONAL AND DEDICATED RESPONSE TO THE CITIZENS OF SAN BENITO COUNTY WHEN THEY CALL FOR HELP. OVER THE COURSE OF A YEAR WE RESPOND TO MORE NO HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND OF THOSE CALLS. COUNTY FAIR PROTECTS MORE IN SIXTY COMMUNITIES INCLUDING THE CITIES OF NEEDLES FONTANA. UPLAND GRAND TERRACE VICTORVILLE HYSTERIA YUCCA VALLEY IN ATLANTA AND ALSO A NUMBER OF OUR MOUNTAIN COMMUNITIES THAT ARE IDENTIFIED WITH LIMITED EGRESS. YOU MAY BE AWARE SEMINAL COUNTY HAS HISTORICALLY EXPERIENCED VERY LARGE AND DESTRUCTIVE WILDFIRES. THAT HAVE TAKEN LIVES DECIMATED TENS OF THOUSANDS OF ACRES AND DESTROYED THOUSANDS OF HOMES INCLUDING THE PANORAMA FIRE. NINETEEN EIGHTY THE GRAND PRIX AN OLD FIRES IN. TWO THOUSAND THREE THE SLIDE FIRE IN. TWO THOUSAND SEVEN IN THE BLUE CAUGHT FIRE IN TWENTY SIXTEEN JUST TO NAME A FEW. OUR NEIGHBORS THROUGHOUT THE STATE HAVE DIDN'T HAVE MORE UNFORTUNATE SITUATIONS CALIFORNIA SEEN A RECORD NUMBER WILD FIRES IN THE PAST YEARS WHICH IS CAUSED MASS AMOUNTS OF DOES THAT STATION. TO THE RESIDENTS OF THE STATE. AB THREE NINETY FOUR BUILDS UPON PREVIOUS EFFORTS TO STRENGTHEN WELFARE PREVENTION AND RECOVERY THEY EXEMPTING FROM SEQUEL PROCESS FOR URGENT PROCESS PROJECTS. THAT ARE RECOMMENDED BY THE BOARD OF FORESTRY TO IMPROVE FIRE SAFETY IN FIRE PRONE SUBDIVISIONS THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AS LACKING SUFFICIENT EGRESS ROUTES. I APPRECIATE YOUR CONSIDERATION IS IMPORTANT MEASURE IN AN URGENT AYE VOTE ON A BETWEEN NINETY FOUR THANK YOU. THE CHIEF. HI JOHN KENNEDY WITH THE WORLD COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIA -- WE SUPPORT THIS BILL IS A WAY TO IMPROVE COMMUNITY WILD FIRE SAFETY WE SUPPORTED THE TEARS AB TWENTY NINE ELEVEN LAST YEAR ONE OF THE IMPORTANT FUNCTIONS AS THE AUTHOR MENTIONED WAS TO HAVE THE BOARD OF FORESTRY GO IN AND IDENTIFY. SPECIFIC COMMUNITIES THAT HIGH FIRE IS THAT LACK A SECONDARY ESCAPE ROUTE AND IMPORTANTLY TO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS ON SPECIFIC PROJECTS TO HELP THOSE COMMUNITIES SURVIVE FIRES -- WE'VE SEEN WAY TOO MANY -- WILD FIRES IN THE LAST TWO YEARS PARADISE HOPEFULLY WAS AN EXCEPTION LAST YEAR WELL THEY DID HAVE FOR SKATE ROUTES CAPACITY WAS A PROBLEM -- SO HERE WE THINK THIS IS A NARROWLY TAILORED BILL ONLY LOOKING AT THOSE COMMUNITIES IDENTIFIED BY THE BOARD OF FORESTRY AND THOSE PROJECTS IDENTIFIED BY THE BOARD OF FORESTRY. WITH BUILT IN SAFEGUARDS FOR WETLANDS RIPARIAN AREAS AND ALSO LISTED SPECIES THREATENED OR ENDANGERED SPECIES -- PUBLIC NOTIFICATIONS AS WELL SO WE THINK THIS IS A GOOD COMPROMISE -- WE APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEES -- SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS THAT WILL BE TAKEN BECAUSE WE THINK THOSE GO TOWARDS ACHIEVING THE AUTHOR'S INTENT WITH THE BILL -- WE SUPPORT THE BILL AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOOD AFTERNOON YELEY COVERAGE FOR THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS WERE ALSO HERE IN SUPPORT BECAUSE WE STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT CALIFORNIA'S EXISTING COMMUNITIES NEED ADDITIONAL PATH TO SAFETY THANK YOU. YOUR SINGLE PICKY WITH A CALIFORNIA FORESTRY ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. HOW DOES TO THE MIKE -- CARLSON ASSOCIATED CALIFORNIA LOGGERS IN SUPPORT. TIMBER INDUSTRY THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT ANYONE IN OPPOSITION. RIGHT AND ALSO SIERRA CLUB CALIFORNIA OUR OFFICIAL POSITION IS OPPOSING ESTIMATES ARE HAPPY TO HEAR THAT THE AUTHOR HAS DECIDED TO ADOPT THE COMMITTEES MINUTES ON TO THREATEN -- FURTHER NARROWLY TAILORED THE BILL AND SO I WOULD REMOVE OPPOSITION WITH THOSE MOMENTS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION [inaudible] SEEING NONE. THE QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE MATHIS.

AND WHILE WE DO THEN WE DON'T WANT TO GET RID OF ALL OUR POLICIES WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE HAVE A PLACE TO LIVE AND GET BACK IN AND GET THEIR LIVES BACK IN ORDER AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE CNN SO RICH LIKE TO CLOSE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THAT FOR ME THE MOST POIGNANT TESTIMONY THAT I HEARD. WHEN WE WENT TO THE COMMUNITY OF PARADISE WAS THE PEOPLE WHO HAD BEEN UNABLE TO GET OUT? DESPITE THE FACT THAT THEY WERE FOR GRASSROOTS AVAILABLE THEY WERE ALL COMPLETELY GRIDLOCKED WERE CLOGGED WITH -- BURNED ABANDONED VEHICLES. WE HEARD TESTIMONY FROM PEOPLE WHO WERE FORCED TO SHELTER IN PLACE IN THEIR CARS IN A WIDE SPOT IN THE ROAD THE TICKET INTERSECTION AND THANKFULLY FOR THOSE PEOPLE IT WORKED OUT BUT YOU CAN. CLEARLY IMAGINE THAT FOR MANY PEOPLE IT WOULDN'T. I LIVE IN A COMMUNITY WITH ONLY THREE ADDRESS ROUTES. IN A FORESTED AREA VERY SIMILARLY SITUATED FROM A FUEL STANDPOINT TO PARADISE AND THERE ARE MANY PLACES IN CALIFORNIA WITH TWO OR ONLY. ONE SO I THINK IT REALLY MAKES SENSE TO TAKE A HARD LOOK AT STREAMLINED LIGHTING THESE VERY IMPORTANT PROJECTS NOT RESPECTFULLY REQUEST DRIVE A THANK YOU VERY MUCH CHIEF THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE -- ENJOYS SUPPORT FROM THE CHAIR I TO WILL BE SUPPORTING US PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. ITEM FOURTEEN AB THREE NINETY FOUR BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER OBERNOLTE THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO REFER TO APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE MEMBERS FRIEDMAN. FLORA FLOOR AYE CHAU. EGGMAN. EGGMAN AYE GARCIA [inaudible] LIMóN [inaudible] MATHIS. MATHIS I MCCARTY. MELENDEZ MELENDEZ AYE MURATSUCHI MURATSUCHI AYE STONE FIVE FIVE BOATS WILL HOLD OPEN. THE DAY MISTER [inaudible] SERVER PATTERSON. LOOKS LIKE YOU HAVE TO BILLS UP. IT'S ALRIGHT WITH YOU WILL START WITH. AB. THREE FORTY THREE FILE ITEM TEN THANK YOU. THAT MISSED BY STERN MEMBERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. TO PRESENT PEOPLE UP. WELL WE WE DO KNOW THAT USING FORCE BY MASS REDUCES THE RISK OF LARGE CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES PROTECTS WATERSHEDS AND IMPROVE THEIR QUALITY. AND PUBLIC HEALTH. HOWEVER WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE COST OF TRANSPORTING BIOMASS ALONE CAN NEARLY DOUBLE THE COST OF A FIRE HAZARD. REDUCTION PROJECT SO IN RESPONSE WERE PROPOSING AB THREE FORTY THREE WHICH WOULD DIRECT THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY TO IMPLEMENT A GRANT PROGRAM TO OFFSET THE COST. OF TRANSPORTING FUELS TO BIOMASS ENERGY FACILITIES WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR WORKING WITH ME AND THE STAFF PROVIDING A WAY FORWARD AND FOR THE AMENDMENTS TO THE BILL WHICH WE I GRATEFULLY UP -- EXCEPT UNDERSTAND THERE WERE CONCERNS WITH RESPECT TO WHICH COMMUNITIES WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR THE PROGRAM. THE COMMITTEE RESPONDED BY REVISING THEIR AMENDMENTS TO MAKE SURE THERE WOULDN'T BE A DELAY IN THAT IMPLEMENTATION WHICH WAS. VERY HELPFUL I DO THINK WE STILL HAVE A FEW CONCERNS JUST ABOUT HOW MANY FACILITIES WELL ACTUALLY QUALIFY UNDER THE NEW. CRITERIA BUT I REALLY DO BELIEVE THAT WHICH WE HAVE TO TAKE ACTION WE HAVE TO TAKE A EFFORTS TO ADDRESS THIS CRISIS. AND FOR THOSE REASONS I'M I'M GRATEFULLY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES. AMENDMENTS BECAUSE WE NEED TO MOVE THIS FORWARD AND WE NEED TO PRACTICE THIS KIND. OF REDUCTION IN THAT COST FOR OBVIOUS REASONS TO HELP EXPLAIN THE NEED FOR A BI THREE FOUR THREE WE HAVE TODAY A MYSTIC YOU'RE SINGLE PICKY WITH THE IT WAS VICE PRESIDENT LEGIT AFFAIRS FOR THE CALIFORNIA FORESTRY ASSOCIATION. AND SPEAK ON THE VARIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS OF USING BIOMASS DR STEPHAN KAFKA DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA BY A MASS COLLABORATIVE OUT OF UC DAVIS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR IT WAS FIRST WITNESS PLEASE. YOUR SINGLE BECKY WITH A CALIFORNIA FORESTRY ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL WE GREATLY APPRECIATE -- ONE OF THE GREATEST DISADVANTAGES THAT BIO MASS FACES COMPARED TO WIND OR SOLAR IS THE THE TRANSPORTATION OF ACTUAL FUEL ITSELF AND THAT'S THE PURPOSE OF AB THREE FORTY THREE AND WHY WE THINK IT IS SO IMPORTANT TO HAVE THIS BILL PASSED TODAY. WE DO HAVE SOME CONSIDERABLE CONCERNS WITH THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS FROM -- COMMITTEE STAFF SPECIFICALLY -- THE PRECLUSION OF BIOMASS FACILITIES WHO HAVE CONTRACTS UNDER SB NINE OH ONE AND THE PRECLUSION OF BIOMASS FACILITIES THAT ARE LOCATED IN NON ATTAINMENT AREAS. CURRENTLY CALIFORNIA HAS TWENTY THREE BIOMASS FACILITIES IN THEIR TOTALITY. SEVEN OF WHICH HAVE BIRAM CONTRACTS SO IF YOU SUBTRACTED SEVEN FROM TWENTY THREE IN. I'M NOT A MATH MAJOR BUT I THINK AT SIXTEEN AND THEN IF YOU THERE ARE ADDITIONAL FOR FACILITIES THAT ARE NON ATTAINMENT SUBTRACTED THAT THEN. YOU KNOW WE'RE LOOKING AT TWELVE FACILITIES AND THEN PRESUMABLY SINCE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ONLY SMALL DIAMETER MORE MATERIAL HAVING TO DO WITH FOREST WE'RE NOT INCLUDING AG FACILITY SO. I'M NOT SURE HOW MANY LEFT FACILITIES ARE LEFT ELIGIBLE FOR THIS MONEY UNDER THIS BILL IN PARTICULAR AND THAT IS A CONCERN THAT I HAVE -- WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THIS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN REDUCE THE COST OF TRANSPORTATION AND THAT SOMETHING THAT'S IMPORTANT WE ALSO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO SPECIFY WHAT SMALL DIAMETER MATERIAL IS I'M NOT SURE WHAT THAT IS -- WE CURRENTLY DON'T HAVE. NOR WOULD WE EVER WANT TO TAKE -- LARGE DIAMETER TREES THAT WEREN'T ALREADY DEAD AND TAKEN TO A BIOMASS FACILITY BECAUSE THERE'S A HIGHER AND USE FOR THOSE. MATERIALS HOWEVER WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT ISN'T INTENDED TO MEAN THAT SLASH FROM A LARGER DIAMETER TREE COULDN'T BE TAKEN TO A BIO MASS FACILITY -- I THINK OUT OF FORCE WE'RE GONNA HAVE A DIFFICULT TIME ASCERTAINING THAT ONE LOT OF THREE SLASH CAME FROM AN EIGHTEEN INCH DIAMETER TREE AND IN ANOTHER SECTION OF THE FORCE THAT ONE CAME FROM THIRTY SIX WE HAVE TO KEEP THE SEPARATE THAT'S JUST NOT THE WAY THAT WORKS. OUT IN THE FOREST SAID THOSE ARE CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE WITH THE AMENDMENTS THANK YOU. THANKS VERY MUCH DOCTOR. LOW IN NAME IS STEVE KAFKA I'M IN THE DEPARTMENT OF PLANT SCIENCES AT UC DAVIS AND DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA BIOMASS COLLABORATIVE. I THINK WE ALL KNOW THAT OF MANY PARTS ARE FOR CERTAIN DIRE CONDITION TERMS OF NUMBERS OF DEAD TREES BUT ALSO IN TERMS OF OVERCROWDING HAVE CANOPY. OF STRUCTURES THAT LEAD TO CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES MANY PARTS OF OUR FORESTS. WE ALSO KNOW THE NUMBER OF DEVASTATING WILDFIRES ARE INCREASING AND I'M ACTUALLY MYSELF PERSONALLY VERY CONCERNED THAT WE COULD SEE CONFLAGRATIONS IN THE FUTURE THAT EVEN FOUR FOOT WHICH ASSAULT LAST SUMMER. WITH SO MANY DEAD TREES IN CERTAIN PARTS OF THE SIERRA NEVADA PARTICULARLY IN OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE'S FORCE THAT -- AND IF CONDITIONS ARE RIGHT IT COULD BE JUST EXTRAORDINARILY BAD. WE ALSO I THINK ALL AGREE THAT HEALTHY FORESTS ARE AN UNAMBIGUOUS PUBLIC GOOD. SO HOW DO WE ACHIEVE THAT GIVEN THE GIVE DIFFICULT CONDITIONS -- THAT WE FACE THE HEALTHY FOREST CONNECTED. CONNECTORS CARBON SINKS NAY DO ELSEWHERE IN THE WORLD BUT CURRENTLY CALIFORNIA'S FORCE ARE SHIFTING OVER TO COURT AND SOURCES IN THIS UNDERMINES THE STATE'S CLIMATE GOALS AND VERY SIGNIFICANT WEIGHT. VERY HARD EARNED AN HARD WON CLIMATE GAINES. THE PRUDENT USE IN FACT WE'VE SEEN WE SING RECOGNITION THIS THE RECENT GOVERNOR'S UP A PROPOSAL. TO DEVELOPERS A STATE OF EMERGENCY AHEAD OF THE FORCE FOR SEASON TO FACILITATE. SOME OF THE SOME OF THE ACTIONS AT THIS BILL WOULD FACILITATE AS WELL. WE KNOW THAT THE PRUDENT USE OF FORCE BY MASS CAN LEAD. TO ALL KINDS OF NEW PRODUCTS TRANSPORTATION FUELS BIOPRODUCTS AND ENERGY PRODUCTION. WE KNOW THAT WILL REDUCE POLLUTION AND HEALTH COSTS AND LOSS OF LIFE. WE KNOW THAT WILL HELP CREATE NEW JOBS ESPECIALLY IN RURAL AREAS AND AMONG DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES CLOSE TO THE SOURCES OF THESE BIOMASS. AND IT'LL HELP OFFSET THE COSTS OF CREATING RECREATING HEALTHY FORCE IN THE STATE. THERE MANY FORMS OF BIOMASS AVAILABLE IN CALIFORNIA ROUGHLY A THIRD POSSIBLY -- ACCESSIBLE FROM URBAN SOURCES IN RESIDUALS THIRD FROM AGRICULTURAL SOURCES NO THIRD FROM FORESTRY. BY AND LARGE THE MOST EXPENSIVE SOURCES OF BIOMASS OR FROM FORESTRY. SO TRIPS AND TRANSPORTATION COSTS OR MAJOR REASON THAT -- FORESTRY BIOMASS IS AMONG THE MOST EXPENSIVE SOURCES. SO WE HAVE TO HAVE AN ADEQUATE SUBSIDY PROGRAM TO FACILITATE THE USE OF THIS BIOMASS TO ACHIEVE THE MANY POSITIVE BENEFITS THAT CAN COME FROM ITS USE. LET ME GIVE YOU SOME EXAMPLES IN THE LAST MINUTE BUT I HAVE. A COMPANY CALLED SWEET WATER ENERGY FOR EXAMPLE A CALIFORNIA BASED TECHNOLOGY COMPANY HAS THE ABILITY TO TAKE WOODY BIOMASS NOW AND CONVERTED INTO SIMPLE SUGARS. CLEAN LIGNIN AND DUST REAL ALCOHOLS THEIR BUILDING INTERESTING NEW PROJECTS WHERE MINNESOTA. NEW YORK IN ESTONIA NOT CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA IS AN EXPENSIVE PLACE TO TO ACHIEVE THESE TECHNOLOGIES WE NEED TO MAKE A CONDITION WHERE WE CAN SEE THESE INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES DEVELOP. CARBON NANOFIBERS CAN BE ADDED TO CONCRETE WHAT DOES THAT DO THAT REDUCES THE ABOUT A CONCRETE YOU NEED IN A PERMANENTLY REDUCES MOVES CARBON FROM THE ATMOSPHERE. AS A POSITIVE MY PROFILE PRODUCTS FOR EXAMPLE THAT CAN BE MADE FROM FORCED BY A MESS. AND LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE FROM ONE CALIFORNIA COMPANY THAT'S ABOUT READY TO BREAK GROUND ON A NEW FACILITY THAT WILL CONVERT WOULD INTO TRANSPORTATION FUELS IN THIS CASE ETHANOL. THAT'S A MEDICINE. THEY COULD AS EASILY USE ORCHARD WOOD FROM THE CENTRAL VALLEY WHICH WILL REDUCE THE BURNING PROBLEM BUT THEY COULD ALSO USE SOFT WHICH SMITH FROM THE STAIRS BUT TRANSPORTATION COSTS IN THOSE CASES OR SIGNIFICANT BARRIERS TO THE USE OF THAT. SO I WOULD SUPPORT. THE PASSAGE OF AB OF THREE FORTY THREE BECAUSE IT SOME MEASURE IT WILL HELP REDUCE THE TO START ON HELPING TO DIVERT TO ADDRESS THESE VERY SERIOUS WILD FOR PROBLEMS. AND IT SHOULD ENCOURAGE THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA AND JOBS. WHICH ARE. A WAY OF HELPING REDUCE SOME OF THE EXPENSIVE COSTS OF OUR CLIMATE PROGRAMS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH DOCTOR ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. DOES NOT ADDRESS MANAGER MANAGER BRIAN WHITE HERE ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA LICENSE FORCED ASSOCIATION AND FORCE LANDLORDS OF CALIFORNIA. A WE ARE ALSO IN SUPPORT THE BILL AS IN PRINT WE'LL HAVE TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT JUST AMENDMENTS BUT WE AGREE THAT JUSTIN TRANSPORTATION COSTS CRITICAL TO MAKE THESE. BIOMASS POWER PLANTS A PENCIL OUT THANK YOU. THANK YOU JULIE NON ASK ABOUT HALF THE CALIFORNIA ABOUT MASS ENERGY ALLIANCE WE ACTUALLY ECHO MISS COOKIES CONCERNS ABOUT THE RESTRICTIVE NATURE OF THE ELIGIBILITY FOR THE BIOMASS PLANTS. IT'S NOT THAT YOU'RE EXCLUDING BIOMASS PLANTS FROM THIS LANGUAGE YOU'RE ACTUALLY RESTRICTING COMMUNITIES THAT ARE HAVE ACCESS TO THESE BIOMASS PLANTS AND BY THIS LANGUAGE YOU HAVE. RESTRICTED THE TEN SOUTHERN MOST SIERRA COUNTIES WHO ARE HARDEST HIT BY THE TREE MORTALITY -- CRISIS FROM PARTICIPATING IN THIS PROGRAM SO WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO KEEP THE DIALOGUE OPEN ABOUT THE RESTRICTIVE NATURE OF THE ELIGIBILITY THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR CHRISTMAS KELLY ON BEHALF OF MENDOCINO REDWOOD COMPANIES AND WE SHARE THE CONCERNS THAT. ARE TRUE ASSOCIATIONS OF BIOMASS ALLIANCE IN THE FORESTRY ASSOCIATION HAVE EXPRESSED WE DO SUPPORT THE BILL IMPRINT BUT WE ARE EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF THESE AMENDMENTS THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON STACY HEAT RURAL COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIA ALSO IN SUPPORT WE DO SHARE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE AMENDMENTS AS WELL BUT ALSO LOOKING FORWARD TO CONTINUING THE CONVERSATION THANK YOU. ERIK KARLSSON REPRESENTED SOCIO CALIFORNIA LAWYERS BUT ALSO LOG HAULERS TRUCKERS AND WHERE THE MOM POP SO IF YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO DRIVE IT FROM THE FORCE TO THE FACILITY IT'S UNFORTUNATELY NOT A BUSINESS PROPOSITION CONSEQUENTLY WERE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL.

SOMETHING THAT I'VE BEEN TRYING TO FOCUS ON SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE HOW DO WE MAKE BIOMASS WORK FOR THE FORCE. FOR AG FOLKS AND CONTINUE TO WORK ON CLEAN AIR. BUT NOT NOT TIE PEOPLE'S HANDS AS A WAY OF OF MAKING SURE THAT GETS DONE SO. I WILL BE SUPPORTING YOUR BILL TODAY AND AND WATCHING IT AS IT GOES THROUGH. THANK YOU ANYBODY ELSE. MR PARRIS ME LIKE TO CLOSE IT WHAT. I TO HAVE THEIR RESERVATIONS THAT WERE EXPRESSED EARLIER. BUT THE REALITY IS THAT WITHOUT THESE AMENDMENTS I DON'T THINK THIS WOULD GET THROUGH THIS COMMITTEE. AND WE ARE OFTENTIMES PUT IN A CIRCUMSTANCE IN WHICH WE NEED TO TAKE. ABOUT THREE QUARTERS OF A LOAF INSTEAD OF THE WHOLE LOAF -- I APPRECIATE THE WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH ME ON THIS AS I SAID IN MY OPENING REMARKS. THIS IS THE BEGINNING I HOPE AND SO WITH THE PASSAGE AND THE IMPLEMENTATION I HOPE WE DEMONSTRATE THAT THERE ARE OTHER OPPORTUNITIES AND OPTIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND ARE. APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO MOVE THE BILL WITH THE AMENDMENTS. AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN START TO DEMONSTRATE. THAT WE CAN EXPAND THE OPPORTUNITY TO INCLUDE SOME OF THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN EXCLUDED FOR WHAT. ON THE SURFACE APPEARS TO BE -- SOME CONCERN BUT LIMITS REALLY THOSE REGIONS THAT HAVE SERIOUS NEED FOR THE CLEAN UP AND THE BIOMASS SO. GIVEN WHAT THE CHOICES WERE I APPRECIATED THE AMENDMENTS KNOWING THAT THAT'S HOW WE GET THIS. BILL MOVING FORWARD I APPRECIATE THAT AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON IT AND I WILL CONTINUE -- TO TO EXPRESS AND REPRESENT THE CONCERNS OF THOSE WHO ARE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL AND YET HAVE SOME RESERVATIONS ABOUT THE LIMITATIONS OF THE AMENDMENTS.

NINE ZERO THANK YOU AND YOU HAVE ANOTHER BILL I DIDN'T. MOVE THE BILL. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THE CALIFORNIA FOR US CLIMATE ACTION TEAM. WAS ASSEMBLED IN AUGUST OF TWENTY FOURTEEN WITH THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF DEVELOPING A FOREST CARBON PLAN WHICH WOULD SERVE AS THE DETAILED IMPLEMENTATION PLAN FOR CALIFORNIA'S. FOREST HEALTH GOALS LAST YEAR GOVERNOR BROWN APPROPRIATED NINETY NINE POINT TWO MILLION TO IMPLEMENT KEY RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE FOREST CARBON PLAN HOWEVER. THERE HAS NOT BEEN A MOVEMENT FROM THIS LEGISLATURE TO REPORT ON THE PROGRESS OF THE ENTIRE PLAN TO FIND OUT WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH THE MONEY AND HOW EFFECTIVELY. IS IT BEING USED SO OF THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE CAL FIRE CAL EPA IN THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY. TO REPORT ANNUALLY UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY FOUR ON THE PROGRESS MADE. ON THESE GOALS I WANT TO THANK AGAIN THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR AMENDMENTS THAT STILL PRESERVE THE INTENT OF THE BILL. A TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE MAKING PROGRESS IN OUR FOREST HEALTH GOALS -- I HAVE WITH ME -- ONE OF THE KEY MEMBERS OF THE FORCE CLIMATE ACTION TEAM RURAL COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIA. REPRESENTED TODAY BY THE REGULATORY AFFAIRS ADVOCATE MISS STACY HIDDEN AND TO EXPLAIN THE NEED FOR A BEACH A SIX ONE SIX IS AGAIN I MISSED -- KRISTIN CALL PICKY WITH THE ADVICE PRESIDENT OF THE LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS FOR THE CALIFORNIA FORESTRY ASSOCIATION. GOOD AFTERNOON STACY HEATING WITH THE ROLE COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIA AND AS A FAMILY MEMBER PATTERSON SAID I WAS ON THE FORCE CLIMATE ACTION TEAM AND WAS INVOLVED IN THE DISCUSSIONS AND FORMULATING FORCED CARBON PLAN AND THAT WAS TWO AND A HALF YEARS OF DISCUSSION. TO WHAT WE THINK IS A PRETTY GOOD PLAN FOR HELPING. TO MAKE CALIFORNIA'S FORCE MORE RESILIENT AND HEALTHIER AND I TO GO AND RESTORE OUR FOR STOOD WATERSHEDS AND AS A STATE WE'VE RESPONDED MUCH MORE QUICKLY TO OTHER GHG EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS SECTORS THAN WE HAVE CALIFORNIA'S FORESTS. WE'VE DONE IMMEDIATE THINGS AND TAKING IMMEDIATE ACTIONS AND AND SAT RATE REQUIREMENTS ON TRANSPORTATION AND SOLID WASTE AND OTHER SECTORS AND IT'S TAKEN US A LOT OF TIME TO GET TO FORCE AND TO GET TO OUR WILD LANDS. AND NOW THAT THE STATE IS THAT SOME PRETTY CONCRETE GOALS IN THE FOREST CARBON PLAN. TO HELP MAKE OUR FORCE IN OUR WILD LANDS MORE RESILIENT MAN THIS INCLUDES INCREASING PACE AND SCALE FORCE MANAGEMENT. DEVELOPING AND SIMULATING AN INNOVATIVE WOOD PRODUCTS INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA WHICH AS WE JUST HEARD FROM OUR BIO MASS DISCUSSION IS. VITAL IN CLEARING OUR MATERIALS OFF THE FOREST OTHERWISE THE GET PILED AND BURNED WHICH IS SOMETHING WE REALLY DON'T WANT. AND RESTORING FOR SOME WATERSHEDS THAT HAVE BEEN DEVASTATED PASSED WILDFIRES -- WE BELIEVE THAT -- AB SIX SIXTEEN WILL AT LEAST SERVE AS A BASELINE FOR AT SOME ACCOUNTABILITY IN MEETING CALIFORNIA'S -- CARBON GOALS IN THE SECTOR AND NOT ONLY THAT BUT THEN OF COURSE WE ALL KNOW THE PUBLIC SAFETY COMPONENT THAT COMES ALONG. WITH -- MAKING CALIFORNIA'S FORCE MORE RESILIENT AND MORE RESISTANCE WILDFIRE IN THE FUTURE SO WITH THAT WE ENCOURAGE OUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU. YOUR SINGLE BECKY WITH THE CALIFORNIA FORESTRY ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR HAS INVESTED SOME PRETTY GOOD CHUNK OF CHANGE -- AND MAKING SURE THAT WE CAN GET HEALTHY FORESTS THAT ARE OUT THERE AND ONE OF THE BEST THE WAYS THAT WE CAN ENSURE THAT. OUR MONEY IS BEING SPENT WISELY AND THAT WE'RE ACHIEVING THEIR GOALS THE RESULTS THAT WERE AIMING FOR IS TO BE ABLE TO HAVE SOME SORT OF REPORT ACCOUNTABILITY PROCESS SO FOR THOSE REASONS FOR SUPPORTING THE BILL. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WHO WISH TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THE BILL. GERMAN MANAGER MEMBER BRIAN WHITE HERE WE HAVE THE CALVARY LICENSE FORCES SOCIALIZATION WHERE THE RICHER STEPHAN FORSTER'S AND ALSO THE FORCE LANDOWNERS OF CALIFORNIA WHERE THE SMALL NON INDUSTRIAL TIMBERLAND OWNERS WE SUPPORT BOTH. THE BILL AND THE FORCE ACTION CLIMATE OF PLAN THAT'S GOING THROUGH AND WE THINK THE GOALS OF BOTH ARE ARE CONSISTENT SO WE ASK REVIVAL THANK. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE PAUL MASON WITH A SPECIFIC FOREST TRUST. WERE ACTUALLY TO REMOVE OPPOSITION BASED ON THE AMENDMENTS BUT WANT TO CLARIFY WHY AN ORGANIZATION. THAT BELIEVES SO STRONGLY ENFORCED RESTORATION WATER SAID IMPROVEMENT -- DIDN'T SUPPORT THE BILL AS IT WAS INITIALLY INTRODUCED AND IT REALLY COMES DOWN TO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH IN OUR FOR US WE'RE TRYING TO GET BACK TO A MORE CARBON RICH CLIMATE RESILIENT CONDITION WITH GOOD WATERSHED FUNCTION. LARGE TREES WELL SPACED WHERE FIRE WOULD BE A NATURAL OCCURRENCE NOT A CATASTROPHE. AND THAT REQUIRES CERTAIN TYPES OF RESTORATION ACTIVITIES STANDING AND THAT'S THE LEGISLATURE TAKEN A LOT OF STEPS BOTH FUNDING AND STREAMLINING EXEMPTIONS AND STUFF IN THE LAST FEW YEARS TO GET THERE. THE GOAL IS ARTICULATED IN THE PLAN OF A HALF MILLION ACRES OF FOREST ACTIVITIES DOESN'T DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THOSE ACTIVITIES AND JUST GOING OUT AND YOU KNOW CLEAR CUTTING OR OTHER COMMERCIAL ACTIVITIES THAT MOVES AWAY FROM THOSE CONDITIONS RATHER THAN TOWARDS THOSE CONDITIONS. SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE LEAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO REFINE THOSE GOALS TO MAKE SURE WE'RE REALLY GETTING TO THE OUTCOMES THAT WERE TRYING TO GET. TO I THINK AS OPPOSED TO BE AMENDED TO BE A REPORT ON THE BROADER GOALS OR THE FOURTH CARBON PLAN. IT'S FINE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WHO WISH TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION. ZERO CALIFORNIA WOULD LIKE TO ALIGN OUR COMMENTS WITH THE PACIFIC FOR TRUST WE REMOVE OPPOSITION AS WELL. THANK YOU I'LL MOVE NOW TO THE COMMITTEE ANY COMMITTEE MEMBERS WITH QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. SEEING NONE I DO WANT TO THANK YOU ONCE AGAIN FOR WORKING SO CLOSELY WITH THE COMMITTEE AND SACRAMENTO I THINK IT'S A VERY GOOD BILL I DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING YOU'D LIKE TO SAY IN CLOSING. NOW WHAT I'D APPRECIATE. THE OPPORTUNITY PRESENT BOTH OF THE BILLS -- THESE ARE BEGINNINGS I HOPE. NOT TO WEB A BIGGER AND BROADER -- APPROACH -- TO FORCE MANAGEMENT -- WE HAVE TO TAKE SOME STEPS I THINK AND I THINK THESE TAKES A GOOD STEPS FORWARD. I'M ASK FOR YOUR I SUPPORT THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY MOVING THESE BILLS ALONG. THANK YOU WITH THAT TO DO WE HAVE WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND I BELIEVE OKAY THEM WE'VE ROLL CALL PLEASE. I AM SEVENTEEN EIGHTY SIX ONE SIX BY THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER PATTERSON THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED AND REFER TO APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. MEMBERS FRIEDMAN AYE FRIEDMAN AYE FLORA FLORA AYE CHAU CHAU AYE EGGMAN. EGGMAN AYE GARCIA. YEAH I LIMóN. LIMON AYE MATHIS. MATHIS I MCCARTY. MELENDEZ. RIGHT TO CHOOSE. FOR A TO G. AYE STONE [inaudible] EIGHT ZERO THANK YOU. JEALOUS OUT [inaudible] MS GONZALEZ [inaudible] THANK YOU. THE FIRST TIME I'VE BEEN IN THIS COMMITTEE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS AB TEN EIGHTY WHAT ENSURE CALIFORNIA'S ON THE FOREFRONT OF REDUCING POLLUTION FROM PLASTIC PACKAGING AND PRODUCTS BY ESTABLISHING COMPREHENSIVE HOLISTIC GOALS FOR THE SOURCE REDUCTION. AND RECYCLING OF SINGLE USE PACKAGING AND PRODUCTS IN THE STATE. EVERY DAY SINGLE USE PACKAGING AND PRODUCTS IN CALIFORNIA GENERATE TONS OF NON RECYCLABLE AND NON COMPOSTABLE WASTE IMPACTING OUR HEALTH NATURAL ENVIRONMENT. AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS PLASTIC POLLUTION STARTS WITH FOSSIL FUEL EXTRACTION TO CREATE PLASTIC IN AFFECTS INDIVIDUAL COMMUNITIES AND ECO SYSTEMS ALONG THE SUPPLY CHAIN. ARE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES OFTEN COMMUNITIES OF COLOR BEAR A DISPROPORTIONATE BURDEN OF THE NEGATIVE IMPACTS FROM MANUFACTURING POLLUTION. INCLUDING HIGHER ASTHMA RATES DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES ALSO TEND TO NOT HAVE LOCAL INVESTMENT FOR CLEAN UP OF LETTER. AT THE END OF A PRODUCT'S LIFE AND LIKE NATURAL MATERIALS THEY DECOMPOSE NEARLY EVERY PIECE OF PLASTIC EVER PRODUCED STILL EXISTS IN OUR LANDFILLS OR THE ENVIRONMENT. AS THESE ITEMS FRAGMENT TO SMALLER PARTICLES KNOWN AS MICROPROCESSORS THEY CAN CONCENTRATE TOXIC CHEMICALS AND CONTAMINATE. IN. OUR FOOD AND DRINKING WATER SOURCES. EXPOSURE TO THESE PLASTICS AND ASSOCIATED TOXINS HAS BEEN LINKED TO CANCERS BIRTH DEFECTS IMPAIRED IMMUNITY ENDOCRINE DISRUPTION AND OTHER SERIOUS HEALTH PROBLEMS. FOR TOO LONG WE'VE FOCUSED ON ONE OFF BANDS. OF CERTAIN PRODUCTS TO TRY TO ADDRESS THIS IN A GAME OF WHACK A MOLE. HOWEVER LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE STILL SPENDING OVER FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY IN ONGOING EFFORTS TO CLEAN UP AND PREVENT LATER IN STREETS STORM DRAINS PARKS AND WATERWAYS. AN EXISTING RECYCLING% INFRASTRUCTURE CANNOT KEEP UP WITH THE PACE OF CONCEPTION OF THESE PRODUCTS. LESS THAN 9% THE PLASTIC IS RECYCLED AND THAT PERCENTAGE IS DROPPING SINCE THE INTERNATIONAL MARKETS RESTRICTED THE AMOUNT AND KINDS OF FOREIGN WAYS THAT THEY WILL ACCEPT. THAT'S WHY WE NEED A SOLUTION LIKE A. B. TEN EIGHTY WHICH GOES BEYOND WHAT CAN BE THROWN INTO A BLUE VAN BUT INSURERS WE'RE ACTUALLY REDUCING THE AMOUNT. A SINGLE USE WASTE AND THAT THE SINGLE USE PACKAGING PRODUCTS WE DO USE ARE ABLE TO BE COMPOSED. COMPOSED COMPOSITE COMPOSED IT. AB OR ARE ACTUALLY BEING RECYCLED INTO NEW PRODUCTS. AB TEN EIGHTY WOULD ESTABLISH GOALS THAT 75% OF SINGLE USE PACKAGING OF PRODUCTS SOLD OR DISTRIBUTED IN CALIFORNIA. MUST BE SOURCE REDUCED OR ACTUALLY RECYCLED BY. TWENTY THIRTY SPECIFICALLY ALL SINGLE USE PACKAGING AND PRODUCTS WOULD HAVE TO BE RECYCLED OUR COMPOSTABLE ON OR AFTER TWENTY THIRTY AND WITH 75% OF PLASTIC SINGLE USE PACKAGING PRODUCTS. TO BE SOURCE REDUCED OR RECYCLED. THE BILL GRANTS CAL RECYCLE AUTHORITY TO ADOPT REGULATIONS TO ACHIEVE THESE GOALS AFTER HAVING GONE THROUGH A SCOPING PLAN DO IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE WHICH INCLUDES STAKEHOLDER INVOLVEMENT. AS PART OF THIS PLAN CAL RECYCLE WOULD WORK TO REFINE THE DEFINITION OF SINGLE USE PACKAGING. AND PRODUCT TO DETERMINE THE SCOPE OF ITEMS IT IMPACTED AS WELL AS WHAT ITEMS WERE TRULY RECYCLABLE OUR COMPOSTABLE. AB TEN EIGHTY ALSO ESTABLISHES IN TERM GOALS REQUIRING MANUFACTURES A SINGLE USE PLASTIC PACKAGING PRODUCTS TO DEMONSTRATE A RECYCLING RATE OF NOT LESS THAN 20% BY. TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND NOT LESS THAN 40% BY. TWENTY TWENTY SIX EIGHTY FIFTH GRADER CAN TELL YOU THE PLASTIC POLLUTION IS WHEN THE BIGGEST THREATS TO OUR ENVIRONMENT WE SIMPLY CAN'T AFFORD TO WAIT ON THIS ISSUE ANYMORE. WHETHER WE ARE MOTIVATED BY THE ENVIRONMENT OUR OWN HEALTH OR SIMPLY THE PUBLIC COST OF DEALING WITH THE ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF WASTE PRODUCED AT WITNESSES HERE TO HELP TO TESTIFY ON THIS IMPORTANT BILL [inaudible] GOOD AFTERNOON. MADAM CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- MY NAME IS MERCED I'LL GET IS GUARDIANSHIP I'M THE FOUNDER AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF A SWORD WORD ORGANIZATION WORKING WITH LATINO COMMUNITIES. TO CONSERVE AND PROTECT R. COSTA NOTIONS. TODAY ON BEHALF OF A SOUL I AM VERY PLEASED TO EXPRESS OUR STRONG SUPPORT FOR AB. ONE TEN EIGHTY AND WHICH WOULD ESTABLISH A TARGET FOR ALL SINGLE USE PLASTIC PACKAGING AND PRODUCTS SOLD OR DISTRIBUTED IN THE STATE. TO BE REDUCE RECYCLED OR COMPOST SAID BY LEAST 75% BY. TWENTY THIRTY AND I THINK WE'RE ALL VERY FAMILIAR WITH THAT WITH THE TRAGIC IMPACTS OF PLASTIC POLLUTION AND THAT'S BEEN IN USE AS WELL A LOT YOU KNOW WITH THE WITH THE WELL THAT WAS FOUND DEAD WITH EIGHTY POUNDS OF PLASTIC IN THE STOMACH. I SEE TURTLES WITH THE WITH THE STRAWS UP THEIR NOSE IN ALL THE COUNTLESS BIRDS -- I THINK ONE OF THINGS WE DON'T TALK ENOUGH ABOUT IS. THE PLASTIC PRODUCED A PLASTIC -- PRODUCTION PRODUCTION AND POLLUTION AFFECTS MORE THEIR AYE VARMINT. AND THE WILDLIFE EFFECTS -- IT'S VERY REAL AND DEVASTATING. IMPACTS FOR PEOPLE BOTH. HERE AND ABROAD -- AND WE BELIEVE THAT THESE ARE IMPORTANT REASONS TO WHY THIS BILL IS NECESSARY. SPECIFICALLY PLASTIC PRODUCTION. FACILITIES ARE TYPICALLY VERTICALLY INTEGRATED AT THE SOURCE OF OIL PRODUCTION AND ARE LOCATED ALONGSIDE REFINERIESIN THE MOST DISADVANTAGED NEIGHBORHOODS THIS A SERIES IMPACTS ON THE LOCAL ENVIRONMENT AND ON THE HEALTH AND WELL BEING ON NEARBYCOMMUNITIES. ADDITIONALLY ONE PLASTIC WASTE IS EXPORTED TO OTHER COUNTRIES THE EXES THAT CAN'T BE PROPERLY MANAGE ALMOST ALWAYS ENDS UP BEING DUMPED IN OR NEAR THE POOREST COMMUNITIES. AND EXACERBATE TO CYCLE OF PRODUCTION AND POVERTY IN THOSE AREAS. IN FACT -- IS THIS PAST DECEMBER DURING A MEETING OF THE EXPERT GROUP OF MARINE THAT ARE INMY CAR PLASTICS WHICH TOOK PART IN A FIRST OF ITS KIND EVENT ORGANIZED BY THE UNITED STATES ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRAM. WHICH START I HAS STARTED TO EXPLORE THE EFFECTS OF PLASTIC POLLUTION AS AN ISSUE OF ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE. WITHOUT IMMEDIATE ACTION TO PLANET SIMPLY CANNOT SUSTAIN THE GROWING RATE OF PLASTIC PRODUCTION AND PRODUCTION AND FOR THAT REASON WE'RE STRONG SUPPORT AND I WOULD LIKE TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF SOLACE FOR HER LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE IN STRONG WASTE -- URGE AN AYE VOTE. GOOD AFTERNOON -- I'M SURE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS KERA MONTHS AND I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES IN STRONG SUPPORT. A LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE YOUR PARTNERS -- ON A NUMBER OF WAYS TO VERSION RECYCLING PROGRAMS AND WE ARE WORKING HAND IN HAND% WITH THE STATE ON A NUMBER OF THE CHALLENGES AT THAT IS SOMETHING MEMBER OUTLINED. MARKET DISRUPTIONS THE NEED FOR CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE EDUCATING THE PUBLIC THESE ARE ALL ISSUES THAT WE'RE WORKING ON BUT WE REALLY NEED TO DO MORE AND THAT'S WHY WE SINCERELY APPRECIATE -- THE PROCESS OUTLINED IN THIS BILL -- PLASTICS ARE POLLUTING OUR ENVIRONMENT OUR WATER WAYS AND ULTIMATELY THEY ARE COSTING CONSTITUENTS OUR RESIDENTS A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF RESOURCES WE SUPPORT THIS APPROACH BECAUSE IT FOCUSES ON THE FRONT AND ON THE SOURCE REDUCTION RATHER THAN DEALING WITH THE WASTE AFTER IT'S ALREADY PRODUCED -- WE KNOW WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK I HAD TO DO BUT REALLY APPRECIATE THE NURTURES TRANSPORTED THIS BILL. AND IF I MAY MADAM CHAIR -- I AM HERE IN IN SOLIDARITY IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL -- WE ARE YOU FOLKS WE KNOW THERE'S A COMPANION BILL IDENTICAL COMPANION BILL ON THESE ON THE SENATE SIDE WE WENT THERE COMMITTEE. LAST WEEK WITH A FIVE TWO ZERO VOTE AND I HAPPY TO TALK A LITTLE ABOUT IT -- BUT IT IS ACTUALLY TRUE THAT THAT THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT HAS A CREATED CHALLENGES ON SO MANY DIFFERENT LEVELS AND ONE THING I SHOULD MENTION LOCAL GOVERNMENT SIDE. OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS NOW OPEN ON THE STATE OR SPENDING FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR ON ON LITTER CLEAN UP -- AND AND AND LITTER PREVENTION ALONE AND THAT DOESN'T EVEN START TO GET INTO THE ENORMOUS CHALLENGES THAT ARE ABOUT TO SLAM ARE THAT ARE ALREADY SLAMMING OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES. WITH THE COURTS TO WASTE MANAGEMENT AND THE IMPACTS OF NATIONAL SORT WHERE THE CHINESE HAVE BASICALLY SAID THEY DON'T WANT TO RECYCLING ANYMORE. THEY'RE NOT WILLING TO TAKE IT AND THAT IS THAT IS IS IS NOW -- CREATING A WATERFALL OF IMPACTS ON LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ABILITY TO TO MANAGE WASTE IS IT'S DISTRESSING HOW LITTLE -- FOLKS -- IT IS IT IS GETTING ACTION RECYCLED -- THE STUFF THAT ACTUALLY IT'S THROWN INTO THE BLUE BANDS. ARE BECAUSE OF THE CURRENT STATE OF PLAY RECYCLING SUPPORT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE NOT ONLY IS TO TO REDUCE WASTE BUT ALSO -- CREATE A MORE OF A MARKET FOR RECYCLED CONTENT RECYCLABILITY TRUE RECYCLABILITY NOT RECYCLABILITY JUST IN THE IN THE LAB BUT RECYCLABILITY IN IN THE REAL WORLD -- IT'S IT'S AN ELEGANT APPROACH IT IT IT IS FLEXIBLE -- BUT ULTIMATELY HELPS TO ADDRESS ONE OF THE MOST PRESSING INFRASTRUCTURAL CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE RIGHT NOW -- AS A STATE AND AND AT LET ALONE ALL THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS ASSOCIATED SO WITH THAT I I'M HAPPY TO TO PARTICIPATE DISCUSSION ANSWER WHATEVER QUESTIONS WILL CLAP.

EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE IT'S EXTREMELY PROBLEMATIC FOR A NUMBER OF STAKEHOLDERS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SO WE WANT TO AVOID A LOT OF THOSE PROBLEMS BY THINKING AHEAD THINKING FORWARD AND MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE. A A COMPLETE SOLUTION HERE WHEN WE TRY TO DEAL WITH THIS WASTE STREAM SO THANK YOU LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD -- THANK YOU. THANK YOU WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. HI GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE TIM CHEST ACHE WITH THE AMERICAN CHEMISTRY COUNCIL -- LET ME. FIRST START BY SAYING THAT WE ARE NOT OPPOSED TO WHAT THIS BILL IS TRYING TO ACHIEVE IN FACT OUR ORGANIZATION HAS SET SOME VERY AMBITIOUS STANDARDS AND RECOVER ABILITY FOR PLASTIC PACKAGING BY. TWENTY THIRTY WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE ISSUES WITH THE CURRENT RECYCLING -- MARKETS -- GIVEN SITUATION CHINA. A NUMBER OF OUR COMPANIES AND NUMBER OF OUR DOWNSTREAM USERS IN THE CONSUMER PRODUCTS SECTOR HAVE TAKEN SOME SERIOUS STEPS AND COMMITMENTS TO INCREASING THE AMOUNT OF MATERIAL TO COVER USING RECYCLED CONTENT -- AND TRYING TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF MATERIAL -- THAT ENDS UP IN OUR OCEANS AND RIVERS. HAVING SAID THAT THERE ARE SOME. ISSUES WITH THE BILL THAT WE THINK WARRANT SOME CONSIDERATION AND ONGOING DISCUSSION AS THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT A COUPLE THOSE TODAY. ONE IS THE SCOPE OF THE BILL. IS UNCLEAR THE BILL USES ARIOUS TERM SINGLE USE PACKAGING SINGING THIS PRODUCTS. SINGLE USE CONSUMER GOODS -- IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE SOME CLARITY AND UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT ALL THIS MEANS THAT'S AN IMPORTANT POINT I THINK NEEDS TO BE CONSIDERED AS THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD. THIS BILL ALSO GRANTS UNFETTERED AUTHORITY TO CAL RECYCLE. TO IMPLEMENT A WHAT'S BEING PROPOSED IN FACT THE BILL SAYS ANY OTHER REGULATIONS ARE POLICIES THE DEPARTMENT DEEMS NECESSARY. THIS IS A SWEEPING DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY TO CAL RECYCLE WE THINK THERE OUGHT TO BE SOME OVERSIGHT AND RULE BY THE ROLE BY THE LEGISLATURE. PRACTICAL TIME LINES. IN OUR VIEW. ARE NECESSARY RIGHT NOW THE BILL SAYS WITHIN A YEAR OUR CYCLE SUPPOSED TO DEVELOP INITIAL SCOPING PLAN. INITIAL RECYCLING RATE NEEDS TO BE DETERMINED BY. TWENTY TWENTY TWO WE DON'T THINK THAT'S AN ACHIEVABLE GOAL PRACTICAL TIME JOHN TIME LINES ARE ARE NEEDED DAY DISNEY GABBY NEED TO BE COLLECTED RECYCLING RATES ANY BE CALCULATED. EXPANSION OF EXISTING COLLECTION INFRASTRUCTURE IS GOING TO BE NECESSARY. DEVELOPING DOMESTIC MARKETS FOR MATERIAL THAT ONCE PREVIOUSLY WAS EXPORTED CHINA. THAT'S GOING TO TAKE SOME TIME. IT'S UNCLEAR ON THE TOPIC OF SOURCE REDUCTION IT'S UNCLEAR TO US WHAT EXACTLY. THAT MEANS AND HOW RESPONSIBLE ENTITIES WOULD COMPLY PACKAGING SERVES A NECESSARY PURPOSE TO GET PRODUCT FROM MANUFACTURE TO MARKET TO THE CONSUMER IN A SAFE AND EFFICIENT MANNER SIMPLY USING LESS PACKAGING. MAY NOT EITHER BE TECHNICALLY FEASIBLE OR MAY NOT EVEN BE. IN QATAR COULD POSSIBLY BE IN CONFLICT WITH WITH STATE FEDERAL LAW. THE FINAL POINT I MAKE IS THAT THE STATE CURRENTLY OPERATES HAS BEEN ON THE BOOKS SINCE THE EARLY NINETEEN NINETIES. CAL RECYCLABLE MEN'S THE RIGID PLASTIC PACKAGING CONTAINER LAW REQUIREMENT THAT PACKAGING FROM EIGHT OUNCES TO FIVE GALLONS EITHER RESOURCE REDUCED OR CONTAIN A PERCENTAGE 25%. RECYCLED CONTENT. MANY COMPANIES ARE COMPLYING WITH THAT HAVE TAKEN STEPS TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF MATERIAL THAT THEY UTILIZE PROPOSED CONSUMER PERSPECTIVE IN THE MANUFACTURE OF NEW PRODUCTS. IT'S UNCLEAR HOW THIS LAW THE EXISTING LAW. WOULD COME WOULD COMPORT WITH WHAT'S BEING PROPOSED UNDER SOME A BILL. TEN EIGHTY SO HAVING SAID THAT I I WE WE ARE OPPOSED UNLESS AMENDED -- WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH OPPONENTS ON THIS WE'RE NOT OBJECTING TO WHAT THIS BILL ULTIMATELY HOPES TO ACHIEVE. WE THINK THERE'S SOME SERIOUS QUESTIONS AND WORK THE NEEDS TO BE DONE TO TRY TO ADDRESS THESE -- BEFORE THE FINAL WORK PRODUCT -- COULD POTENTIALLY BE SENT TO THE GOVERNOR SO WITH THAT WE ARE ARE OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED CREATE THE OPTION TO MAKE THESE COMMENTS THANK YOU AND PLEASE STAY THERE I BELIEVE THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE A QUICK. QUESTION FOR YOU FROM ONE OF THE MEMBERS IN JUST A MOMENT. THERE ANY OTHER MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WHO WISH TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION OF THE BILL. BEN CHAIR MEMBERS JOE ADLER ON BEHALF OF PLASTICS INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION -- WE TESTIFIED LAST WEEK TO THE CENTER ALLEN AND WE'RE IN THE SAME POSITION NOW WE'VE OUTLINED OR WE EIGHT ECHO ALLOW WITH MR SHESTAKOV SAID WE OUTLINED OUR POSITION IN OUR LETTER TO THE COMMITTEE.

THANK YOU MATT CERTAIN WITH THE CALIFORNIA RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION AS WELL WE COULD WORK EFFECTIVELY WITH SENATOR.

ERIN ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION ASSOCIATE OUR COMMENTS WITH THE MISTER SHASTA ACT LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER GONZALEZ.

DENNIS ALBION AND HAVE THE GROCERY MANUFACTURERS ASSOCIATION AS WELL AS THE AMERICAN BEVERAGE ASSOCIATION AGAIN WE ASSOCIATE OUR COMMENTS WITH -- MISTER SHAW STICK AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING ON SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON DON CAP KIßM HALF THE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION WITH A LINE MY COMMENTS ARE WITH THOSE OF THE PER SPEAKERS AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING TOGETHER THANK YOU. THANK YOU WE'RE GONNA MOVE NOW TO THE COMMITTEE I BELIEVE MS EGGMAN HAD A NOT A I JUST WANT TO SAY -- WELCOME IS CONTROLS TO THIS COMMITTEE AND TO WORKING IN THE SPACE -- AT AN AS YOU'RE WORKING A BIG POLICIES LIKE THIS I UNDERSTAND THAT SOMETIMES DEFINITIONS AND WORKING THESE THINGS OUT CRITICAL WHILE. WORKING ON SOMETHING SIMILAR -- THAT WILL COMPLEMENT WHAT YOU'RE DOING I'M SURE. SO I'M PREPARED TO MOVE THIS BILL TODAY TO IF IT HASN'T BEEN MOVED YET TO CONTINUE MOVING IT FORWARD -- AND I TRUST THAT YOU CAN HAVE IT PEOPLE AT THE TABLE BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW THIS IS A PROBLEM WE HAVE TO GRAPPLE WITH AND WE NEED TO COME TO TABLE FIGURE OUT HOW TO WORK IT OUT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. THANK YOU IN A SECOND -- THE MOTION I DO APPRECIATE THAT THEIR ACTION YOUR POINT WITH THIS BILL -- I HOPE AS WE'RE DOING THIS WORK THAT WERE ALSO THINKING ABOUT HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THERE'S A MARKET. READY TO TAKE THESE PRODUCTS THE LASTING WHY DO THEY SEE SOME OF OUR OTHER. PROGRAMS OUT THERE WE HAVE A BUNCH OF RECYCLED MATERIAL SITTING IN WAREHOUSES. AND SO I HOPE THAT THOSE DISCUSSIONS CONTINUE IN AND OUT OF THIS BILL -- THERE'S A NUMBER OF BILLS OUT THERE THAT WAS VERY TO ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE ISSUES WHETHER IT'S MANDATING A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF RESPECTABLE. ELEMENTS IN OUR PRODUCTS OR OTHER THINGS BUT I HOPE WE'RE HAVING A DISCUSSION NOW AND NOT IN. TWENTY THIRTY ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS MR STONE. JUST A BRIEF COMMENT THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. WE OFTEN SEE WE'RE TRYING TO DO WITH PLASTICS WE'VE TRIED SOMEONE OFTEN ONE ALSO REALLY NOT GONNA WORK BANDS AND OTHER THINGS BUT SOMETIMES THAT'S ALL THAT'S LEFT TO US. AS WE REALLY TRY AND GET THE ATTENTION OF EVERYONE WHO IS USING A PROLIFERATING ESPECIALLY SO. IT'S NICE TO HEAR OR ALL OF THE OPPOSITION AS BEING WILLING TO WORK WITH YOU ON THIS AND I HOPE THAT THAT REALLY HOLDS TRUE. BECAUSE TO OFFICE IT'S EASIER TO KILL SOMETHING OF THIS GO THEN REALLY WORK THROUGH THE PROBLEM AND IT'S GOING TO TAKE. DESIGN MANUFACTURE DISTRIBUTION. AND FIGURE OUT OF THE BACK AND HOW WE MANAGE THE RECYCLING. AND WHEN WE FOCUS ON TO THAT END BUT WE CAN'T FORGET THE WE'VE ALWAYS HEARD THIS AS WE WERE GROWING UP REDUCE REUSE RECYCLE WILL ALWAYS SEEM TO BE DO LATELY IS FOUR FOUR BECAUSE THE RECYCLING RECYCLING RECYCLING WE KNOW THAT THAT SYSTEM. IS IN A BIT OF COLLAPSE IT IS NOT WORKING. SO WE HAVE TO REDUCE WHAT WE USE WE HAVE. TO REPURPOSE AND THINK ABOUT THAT BUT ALSO LOOKING AT PACKAGING AND CONTENTS OF PRODUCTS CLASSICS ARE NOT GOING AWAY. BUT HOW MUCH IS THE EACH OF THE ITEMS OF SOME OF THE IS IS REALLY THE INQUIRY THAT WE NEED TO MAKE. A PARTNER WITH INDUSTRY A PARTNER WITH THOSE WHO ARE TRYING TO BE IN THE ECONOMY AND MAKING MONEY THAT'S FINE. BUT HELP US SO THAT WE ARE NOT LEFT TO HAVING INDIVIDUALS AND GOVERNMENT IS CLEANING UP THE MESS IT'S GREAT COASTAL CLEANUP DAYS IT'S A REAL RALLYING CRY FOR PEOPLE. TO GO OUT THERE AND DO THAT BUT THE AMOUNT OF TIME AND MONEY THEY GET SPENT BY TAXPAYERS. LOCAL. AGENCIES AND INDIVIDUALS CLEANING UP THE MESS THAT WE'VE CREATED OUR ENVIRONMENT IS A LITTLE BIT FRUSTRATING WHEN A BETTER SOLUTION WOULD BE TO BRING. ALL THE PARTIES TOGETHER FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN. ALLOW THE PRODUCTS TO BE IN OUR ECONOMY THE ONES THAT PEOPLE REALLY WANT TO BE ABLE TO USE. BUT SOLVE THE AMOUNT OF PLASTIC AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS TO THOSE PRODUCTS IN THE AT SO I THINK THERE REALLY ARE SOLUTIONS HERE. AND IT THESE BIGGER SCALE THINGS ARE DIFFICULT. BUT IF WE CAN GET ALL THE PLAYERS TAKING SOME OF RESPONSIBILITY REALLY HELPING ALL THIS OUT -- HOPEFUL THAT THERE'S A GREAT PATH HERE SO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD THINKING. THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS ALL I JUST WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR -- BOTH THE ASSEMBLY AUTHOR AND THE SENATE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD I'M VERY PROUD TO BE AN AUTHOR. OF THE BILL AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT CERTAINLY HAS CAPTURED THE ATTENTION OF OUR VOTERS OF THE PUBLIC. AND IN CALIFORNIA YOU KNOW WE DO A PRETTY DECENT JOB OF KEEPING A LOT OF THESE INVER OF THESE POLLUTANTS OUT OF OUR IMMEDIATE OUT THIS OUT OF OUR IMMEDIATE ENVIRONMENT SO WE DON'T SEE THIS MUCH BUT THAT'S NOT THE CASE AROUND THE WORLD. AND CERTAINLY WITH A LOT OF THE PLASTICS THAT WE SHIPPED OVERSEAS -- YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENS WITH A LOT OF THOSE THAT END UP NOT BEING RECYCLED AND BEING INSTEAD DUMPED INTO THEIR ENVIRONMENT. AND SO PEOPLE REALLY ARE DEMANDING THAT WE DO A LOT BETTER AND THE PUBLIC -- WHEN THEY PURCHASE A PRODUCT THEY DON'T -- ALWAYS EXPECT THAT PRODUCT TO THEN BE WRAPPED IN PLASTIC AND SHIPPED IN MORE PLASTIC -- AND THE MANUFACTURERS AND THE SHIPPERS AND THE RETAILERS -- SOMETIMES TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT BUT A LOT OF TIMES UNFORTUNATELY DON'T AND WHAT THEY DO INSTEAD IS THEY DUMP A LOT OF THIS. MATERIAL INTO OUR COMMUNITIES AND EXPECT OUR COMMUNITIES TO PAY THE COST -- WITH THEIR POCKETBOOKS AND YOU KNOW ENVIRONMENTALLY -- OF FOR THEIR OWN PROFITS AND THAT HAS TO YOU KNOW I THINK I AS A BODY WE HAVE TO TAKE VERY DEFINITIVE ACTION AGAINST THAT I THINK THE PUBLIC'S EXPECTING IT.

I PROBABLY SEE IT A LOT MORE THAN SOME OTHER COASTAL COMMUNITIES NOT JUST ON ON COASTAL CLEANUP DAY ON THE BEACH BUT EVERY SINGLE DAY. IN OUR NEIGHBORHOODS -- IN OUR PARKS AND AND ON THE ON THE GROUNDS. OF OUR STREETS AND SO -- THIS IS SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED -- FOR THE WELL BEING OF ALL COMMUNITIES BUT IS SPECIFICALLY AN ISSUE I THINK IN SOME OF OUR LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES WHO ARE WHO ARE BURKE BURDEN NOT ONLY.

CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M HERE TODAY TO ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR AB SIXTY FIVE THIS BILL WILL INVEST IN GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE ON THE CALIFORNIA COAST. IN ORDER TO COMBAT SEA LEVEL RISE AS THIS BODY WELL KNOWS CLIMATE CHANGE IS THE FUNDAMENTAL CHALLENGE CONFRONTING OUR GENERATION. AS OUR STATE CONTINUES TO LEAD ON COMBATING CLIMATE CHANGE AND WE WORK TO ACHIEVE OUR CLIMATE GOALS WE ALSO MUST SAFEGUARD CALIFORNIA DEVELOPING STRATEGIES TO ADAPT TO CLIMATE CHANGE. AND STRATEGIES TO MITIGATE THEN ON OUR COAST THE CALIFORNIA COAST IS EIGHT HUNDRED AND FORTY MILES OF BREATHTAKING BEAUTY. HOME TO NEARLY 70% OF CALIFORNIANS AND CRITICAL ENGINE OF CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY. BUT THAT'S ALL UNDER THREAT FROM SEA LEVEL RISE SEA LEVELS ARE PROJECTED TO RISE BY FIVE FEET BY THE END OF THIS CENTURY AND IF WE DO NOT ACT CALIFORNIA WILL LOSE MORE THAN HALF OF OUR COASTAL HABITAT TO SEA LEVEL RISE. MILLIONS OF PEOPLE AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS ARE DIRECTLY AT RISK UNLESS WE ACT NOW. AND OUR BEST DEFENSE IS NATURE ITSELF OUR COASTLINES ARE AMONG THE MOST DYNAMIC ENVIRONMENTS ON EARTH. THEY'RE CONSTANTLY SHAPED BY WAVES WINDS TIDES AND STORMS NATURAL ECOSYSTEMS THRIVE ADMITS THIS CHANGE AND HAVE INDEED DEVELOP THE CAPACITY TO SHAPE THAT CHANGE. SOME EXAMPLES OF NATURAL OR GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE SOLUTIONS INCLUDE DUNES WHICH REDUCE FLOODING AND REPLENISH BEACHES KELP AND SEAGRASS WHICH REDUCE WAVE IMPACTS AND MARSHES WHICH CAN REDUCE FLOODING AERATION. AND NATURAL INFRASTRUCTURE DOESN'T JUST COMBAT SEA LEVEL RISE THIS APPROACH CREATES COASTAL HABITATS THAT ARE IMPORTANT FOR CARBON SEQUESTRATION AND BUILD RESILIENT ECOSYSTEMS. ADDITIONALLY ACCORDINGTO THE EPA GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE ALSO COSTS LESS THAN CONVENTIONAL GRAY INFRASTRUCTURE MAKING THIS A COST EFFICIENT. RESILIENT APPROACH TO COASTAL ADAPTATION. AB SIXTY FIVE WILL INVEST IN GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE SOLUTIONS THAT ARE PROVEN TO WORK IS WHEN WE PROTECT NATURE NATURE PROTECTS US. I'M PLEASED TO INTRODUCE TO SUPPORTERS TODAY TO ADD TO COMMENT. RVCA MASTER NADO FROM THE TRUST FOR PUBLIC LAND TO I GET THAT RIGHT BUT YOUR LAST NAME. DEVELOP POTTER FROM THE NATURE CONSERVANCY. THANK YOU -- MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS RECALL MUST REALLY NOT A WITH THE TRUST FOR PUBLIC LAND. CERTAINLY WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLYMAN BERBER UP PETRIE-NORRIS FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD. AND AS SHE MENTIONED WE THERE'S A LOT OF STEAK WITH OUR COASTLINE EIGHT HUNDRED MILES OF MOST OF THE PEOPLE. A NINETY SIX BILLION DOLLAR ECONOMY THAT'S RELATED TO OUTDOOR ACTIVITIES A LOT OF THAT IS ON THE COAST A LOT OF TOURISM. A LOT OF SPECTACULAR LANDSCAPES -- NATURAL SYSTEMS SHOULD ALWAYS BE EXPLORED BEFORE GRAY INFRASTRUCTURE FOR ALL THE REASONS THAT THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER NOTED. THEY ARE. LESS EXPENSIVE. THEY DO FOSTER -- NATURAL SYSTEMS AND ECOSYSTEMS AND HABITATS. AND WE BELIEVE THERE ARE MORE EFFECTIVE FRANKLY. SO -- REALLY APPRECIATE YOU BRING THIS FORWARD WARMER -- STRONG SUPPORT AND THINK THIS IS JUST A SIMPLE BUT REALLY SMART BILL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU -- MICHELLE PASSER OVER THE NATURE CONSERVANCY I'M THE DIRECTOR CALIFORNIA CLIMATE PROGRAM AND MY COLLEAGUE ISABELLA IS IN THE AUDIENCE HERE SO WE WE OFTEN. TECH YOU KNOW DON'T NOT A PROBLEM -- SO -- WE APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK AND WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE LEADERSHIP -- BY ASSEMBLY WOMAN PETRIE-NORRIS AND I THINK YOU COVERED A LOT OF THE REASONS WHY IT'S IMPORTANT -- TO FOR US TO USE NATURAL FOR STRUCTURE TO HELP SAFEGUARD COMMUNITIES. AGAIN SANTA VOIDABLE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE -- AND YOU AS YOU MAY KNOW FROM THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCIL REPORT THAT WE ARE ALREADY EXPERIENCING THE EARLY IMPACTS OF SEA LEVEL RISE THIS INCLUDES. A MORE EXTENSIVE COASTAL FLOODING DURING STORMS -- PERIODIC TIDAL FLOODING AND INCREASE COASTAL EROSION AND SO WHILE WE DO NEED TO CONTINUE TO REDUCE EMISSIONS TO AVOID THE POTENTIAL WORST CASE SCENARIOS WE ALSO DO NEED TO BE PREPARED FOR THE UNAVOIDABLE IMPACTS TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND WE DO THINK AB. SIXTY FIVE DOES THAT -- IT REINFORCES THE USE OF NATURAL INFRASTRUCTURE GREEN INFRASTRUCTURES ARE SAYING AS A KEY TOOL TAKE A SAFEGUARD HUMAN AND NATURAL COMMUNITIES AGAINST YOU LOVE ARISE -- AND IT DOES THIS BY CLARIFYING THE KINDS OF NOT NATURAL INFRASTRUCTURE -- THAT THE COSTA CONSERVANCY MAY INVEST IN -- SUCH AS THE WETLANDS BEACHES HELP FOR US IN TITLE MARCHES THAT WERE MENTIONED -- THIS WILL HELP THEIR COMMUNITIES FROM ENHANCE CLIMB INVESTS -- THE OTHER IMPORTANT PIECE OF THIS BILL -- DOES IT AUTHORIZES THE COASTAL CONSERVANCY TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO LOCAL COMMUNITIES. AND BASED ON OUR EXPERIENCE WORKING WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS LOCAL COMMUNITIES THIS IS A HUGE GAP -- AND IT REALLY IS A BARRIER -- FOR OUR COMMUNITIES RIGHT NOW REALLY CROSS THE BOARD TO ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE I'M SO WE THINK THIS IS ALSO -- PRETTY CRITICAL -- SO WITH THAT WE'RE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF AB SIXTY FIVE AND WE DO URGE YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL.

THIS BILL ALSO INCREASES THE CALIFORNIA TIRE FEE BY A DOLLAR. FIFTY TO RAISE REVENUE TO FUND PROJECTS AND PROGRAMS FOR MUNICIPAL. SEPARATE STORM SEWER SYSTEM PERMIT COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS. AFTER JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY FOR THE TIRE FEE WILL DROP FROM. THREE TWENTY FIVE PER TIRE. TO TWO TWENTY FIVE THE COMPETITIVE GRANTS OFFERED BY THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD. WOULD GO TOWARD LIMITING SINK POLLUTANTS IN WATER. WHICH ARE YOU BECAUSE BY TIRE WEAR AND OTHER SOURCES. I PLAN ON CONTINUING TO WORK ON TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS WITH THE BOARD CALL RECYCLING THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TAX. AND FEE THAT CURRENTLY ADMINISTERS THE TIRE FEE FOR CALL RECYCLE AND A. R. B.. STORM WATER RUNOFF AND POLLUTION ARE COMMON CAUSES TO THE HIGH COST OF WATER INFRASTRUCTURE. A SOPHISTICATED SYSTEMS ARE REQUIRED TO TEST FOR AND TREAT POLLUTANTS. I RECOGNIZE THE CONCERNS OF THE OPPOSITION AND WEIGH THEM WITH THE REALITIES CITIES IN CALIFORNIA ARE CONFRONTED WITH A LOOK FORWARD TO EXPLORING WAYS. WE CAN MAKE THIS APPROACH VIABLE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH THE M. S. FOR PERMITS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE TO INVEST BILLIONS IN WATERSHED INFRASTRUCTURE AND STORM WATER CAPTURE TECHNOLOGY. TO MAINTAIN A HEALTHY QUALITY OF WATER BILLIONS THEY SIMPLY DO NOT HAVE. THIS BILL IS CONSISTENT WITH RECOMMENDATIONS MADE TO ADDRESS STORMWATER FUNDING FOR LA COUNTY. BUT MAKES GRANTS AVAILABLE TO MUNICIPALITIES ACROSS THE STATE. FOR THESE REASONS I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE AND WITH ME -- TO TESTIFY AS A WITNESS IS PAUL HOOPER DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENT AND COMMUNITY RELATIONS SAN GABRIEL VALLEY COUNCIL OF GOVERNMENTS. THANK YOU SIMPLY MEMBER HOLDEN -- MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS PAUL HUGH BLUR. I'M HERE TODAY REPRESENTING THE THIRTY CITIES OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY COUNCIL OF GOVERNMENTS AS THIS SPONSOR OF AB. SEVEN FIFTY FIVE AS ASSEMBLYMAN HOLDEN STATED AB SEVEN FIFTY FIVE WOULD INCREASE THE CALIFORNIA TIRE FEE BY A MODEST DOLLAR FIFTY PER TIRE TO HELP CITIES FUND CLEANUP PROJECTS TO REDUCE AND ELIMINATE ZINC. FOUND IN STORM WATER RUNOFF TIRE WEAR HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED VICE SURVEYS AS A MAJOR SOURCE OF ZINC AND URBAN RUNOFF. THIS LEGISLATION IS MODELED ON THE SEVENTY FIVE CENTS PER TIRE FEE FOR THE CALIFORNIA AIR POLLUTION CONTROL FUND. MADE AVAILABLE TO THE STATE AIR RESOURCES BOARD AND LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS. TO FUND PROGRAMS AND PROJECTS THAT MITIGATE TO REMEDIATE AIR POLLUTION CAUSED BY TIRES IN THE STATE. ZINC IS AMONG SEVERAL DOZEN HEAVY METALS AND OTHER CONTAMINANTS. THAT ARE CONSIDERED HIGH LEVEL WATER QUALITY THREATS FOR IMPAIRED WATER BONTA BODIES IN THE LOS ANGELES REGION AND THROUGHOUT LARGE AREAS IN CALIFORNIA. ELEVATED ZINC CONCENTRATIONS IN URBAN RUNOFF MUST BE ADDRESSED TO CHIEF CLEAN WATER. ACT COMPLIANCE IN MANY CALIFORNIA URBAN AREAS. THE REMOVAL OF CONTAMINANTS INCLUDING SING FROM STORM WATERS AN URGENT ISSUE FOR A NUMBER OF CITIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. AS ASSEMBLY MEN HOLDEN AND STATED. IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY FOR THE EIGHTY EIGHT CITIES IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY THE ESTIMATE IS APPROXIMATELY TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS BY TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT TO REMOVE A SINK AND OTHER CONTAMINANTS FORCE CLEAN WATER ACT COMPLIANCE. SIX BILLION DOLLARS ALONE FOR THE THIRTY ONE CITIES IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. AS NOTED BY SOME WOMEN HOLDEN AB SEVEN FIFTY FIVE COMPLEMENTS THE MEASURE W. A INITIATIVE THAT WAS RECENTLY APPROVED BY THE VOTERS IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY. TO TAKE ON THE ISSUE OF STORM WATER CONTENT CAPTURE AND CONTAMINANT REMOVAL. AB SEVEN FIFTY FIVE IS PART OF THE TOOL BOX OF OPTIONS NEEDED FOR STORM WATER COMPLIANCE. AND IS PREMISED ON THE SOUND PUBLIC POLICY THAT OUR PRODUCT IF DEMONSTRATED TO BE A MAJOR SOURCE OF A CONTROLLED CONTAMINANT WHEN USED AS INTENDED. SHOULD INCORPORATE IN ITS COST STRUCTURE. A FEED TO HELP OFFSET THE COST OF MITIGATING THE CONTAMINANT YOUR TIME IS THE TIME IS UP -- CASH WITHOUT AYE -- CONCLUDE MY REMARKS AND AS FOR YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU [inaudible] ANOTHER WITNESS. OKAY ANY MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC WHO WISHES TO SPEAK IN FAVOR OF THIS MEASURE. LARA COMES HERE CLUB CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. SELECT US ON BEHALF OF OF STOP WASTE IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE JEFF SIEVERS ON HALF THE U. S. TIRE MANUFACTURERS ASSOCIATION. THE ASSOCIATION REPRESENTS THE AT TWELVE MANY FACTORS BASS THE UNITED STATES TO MAKE TIRES. I WAS UP INSURANCE THIS BILL AND REMAIN OPPOSED TO IT FOR SEVERAL REASONS -- FIRST -- BASICALLY IT SEEKS TO NEARLY DOUBLE THE TIRE TAX. IN ORDER TO ADDRESS AN ISSUE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. ALTHOUGH HE STATED BY THE SUPPORTERS -- THERE MANY METALS THE FALL IN THE WATER YET WE'RE IDENTIFYING ZINC AS ONE THE AUTHORS ALSO STATED THAT IS CAUSED BY TIRES. IN BY MOST OF THE STUDIES THAT HAVE BEEN DONE THROUGHOUT THE WORLD TIRES ARE ACTUALLY BUT ONE ELEMENT THAT MAY BE CONTRIBUTING TO IT. THE BIGGEST SOURCE OF ZINC SEEMS TO BE GALVANIZED METAL BUT IT'S ALSO A NATURALLY. OCCURRING SUBSTANCE IN THE ENVIRONMENT AS WELL AS USED IN -- INDUSTRIAL USE. SECONDLY -- YEAH THE COST -- AND GOT TO MENTION THIS TO BE IN EXCESS OF TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS TO ADDRESS IT IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. RAISING THE TIRE FEE DOLLAR -- FIFTY FOR THE ROUGHLY THIRTY MILLION TIRES ARE SOLD ANNUALLY IS A BUT A DROP IN THE BUCKET IS NOT GOING TO GET THERE TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE -- THIRDLY I'D SAY. TIRES ARE NOT NECESSARILY THE SOURCE THE PROBLEM IN FACT MAY BE PART OF THE SOLUTION. AND CURRENTLY CAL RECYCLES ACTUALLY STUDYING THIS LOOKING AT LEACHING FROM -- GROUND TIRE RUBBER SEE IF IT ACTUALLY IS AN ISSUE -- THEY'RE CURRENTLY DOING THE STUDY THIS YEAR THEY SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO FINISH ALSO THEY'VE ACTUALLY FUNDED STUDIES IN ACTUALLY IDENTIFIED GROUND TIRES AS A WAY TO REDUCE HEAVY METALS FROM GOING INTO THE STORM RUNOFF. THEY ANISHA RESULTS ON THAT ARE VERY VERY POSITIVE SAID THIS MAY ACTUALLY PART OF THE SOLUTION NOT NECESSARILY THE PROBLEM. AND FINALLY I'D LIKE TO SAY -- I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THIS IS PRIMARILY A SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ISSUE YET THE SOLUTION IS TO TAX EVERYBODY IN THE STATE -- IF THIS WAS AN ISSUE FOR THIS FOR THE ENTIRE STATE -- THEN WHY ARE SELECT THE SAN FRANCISCO IN THE BAY AREA AND SOME THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES NOT REPORTING ANY ZINC RUN OFF AS PART OF THE WATER WASTE. YET SOARED INTO TAX THE ENTIRE STATE FOR THIS PRODUCT AND THEN THE LANGUAGE SPECIFICALLY IN SECTION THREE SAYS IS ESSENTIALLY MONEY CAN ONLY BE USED BY -- BY LOCALITIES THAT ARE EXCEEDING THEIR THEIR LIMITS WHICH HAPPENED ALL BE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. SELL -- FOR THOSE REASONS AND SEVERAL OTHERS WOULD LIKE TO KEEP SEEKING ALTERNATIVES AND LOOK FOR WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR HI. JACK MORE DONOVAN BEHALF OF THE AUTOMOTIVE SERVICE COUNCILS IN CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA AUTOMOTIVE BUSINESS COALITION AND CALIFORNIA TIRE DEALERS ASSOCIATION. THE DOLLAR FIFTY TAX IS IS AN OAK A REGRESSIVE TAX IT FALLS HARDEST ON LOW INCOME AND HARD WORKING FAMILIES -- TIRE DEALERS HAVE COUNTLESS STORIES WERE POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS DELAY THE PURCHASE OF TIRES UP BECAUSE THEY CAN'T AFFORD HIM AND THEY SIMPLY DRIVE AWAY AND DANGEROUS BALD TIRES -- IT THE TIRES ARE EXPENSIVE YOU HAVE A SALES TAX ON TOP OF THE TIRES YOU HAVE A DISPOSAL FEE YOU HAVE AN ADDITIONAL -- TIRE FEE -- WHICH IS CURRENTLY A DOLLAR SEVENTY FIVE AND THIS IS JUST GOING TO THIS DOLLAR FIFTIES ON TOP OF ALL THOSE FEES. WE RECOGNIZE THIS PUBLIC HEALTH THREATS CAUSED BY THE POLLUTANTS THAT ENTER THE STORM WATER. RUNOFF BUT WHY ARE WE PICKING ON TIRES OF ZINC IS IN MANY CONSUMER PRODUCTS OUTDOOR METAL SERVICES FOR EXAMPLE GALVANIZED STEEL -- IS COATED WITH A LIQUID ZINC AND YOU HAVE -- LIGHTING AND STREET LIGHTS AND SIGNS AND BENCHES AT ALL CONTRIBUTE TO THE STORM WATER IT -- PROBLEM SO WE BELIEVE ANY NEW FEES OR TAXES SHOULD BE SHARED FAIRLY AMONG ALL THE PRODUCTS THAT BECAUSE POLLUTANTS. TO ENTER THE STORM OF WATER -- RUNOFF NOT JUST TIRES. SO WITH THAT -- WE RISK WESTERLY RI IT RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A NO VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU ANY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION. HIS NAME ORGANIZATION YOUR POSITION PLEASE GOOD AFTERNOON SERRA -- ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN OPPOSITION. SEAN WAS THE NATIONAL FEDERATION OF IN A BUSINESS ALSO OPPOSITION THANK YOU. THANK YOU NOW WE'LL TURN TO THE COMMITTEE IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS BUT THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD MR HOLD IN THIS A I HAVE I ALSO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE THE THE JUMP IN IN THE IN THE FEE. BUT I ALSO UNDERSTAND AS SOMEBODY WHO REPRESENTS AN AG AREA ABOUT THE PROBLEM WITH DUMB TIRES ALL OVER THE PLACE TO SOME IS GONNA PAY FOR THAT -- AND SO I'LL BE SUPPORTING YOUR BILL TODAY AND WITH THAT WOULD LIKE TO MOVE IT UP WE WATCHING AS IT GOES FORWARD AND AND SEE WHAT THE END PRODUCT LOOKS LIKE I UNDERSTAND. LIKE MANY THINGS IT'S A WORK IN PROGRESS. I THANK YOU MISTERHOLDEN I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS. FOR AWHILE -- AND THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF DISCUSSION BACK HOME OF THE COST TO CLEAN UP -- CONTAMINANTS -- LOTS OF CONTAMINANTS SUCH AS THIS ITEM. I HAVE A A QUESTION THOUGH ABOUT THE THE FIND ARE ALL THE FEES JUST COMING FROM THE CONSUMER ARE THERE ANY OTHER FUNDS IN THERE THAT ARE COMING FROM. MANUFACTURERS ARE I MEAN HOW ARE WE SHARING THESE COST AND THE RESPONSIBILITY. YEAH THE FEES AS THE FEARS ATTACHED TO THE THE COST OF OF THE TO THE TIRE AND IT'S ONE OF A NUMBER WAYS TO TRY TO GENERATE SOME REVENUE AS WAS POINTED OUT IS IT GOING TO BE ENOUGH NO BUT IT'S ONE TOOL IN THE TOOLBOX TO TRY TO GET. US THERE -- THE THE COSTS ARE -- ARE IT AS A FEE -- TO COMPLIMENT -- THE THE WATER. THE WATER BOND PROP ONE DOLLARS OF THEIR A LOT OF FUNDS THAT ARE OUT THERE THEY'RE OVER SUBSCRIBED AND SO TO TRY TO IDENTIFY ADDITIONAL RESOURCES. WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS FEE AS ONE THAT WOULD APPLY TO AND I BELIEVE WITH NEW TIRES I TURNED A SURE WHO WERE. TO TO FURTHER DESCRIBE BUT IT'S A WAY TO JUST GENERATED BASED ON FOR THE RETAILER. YEAH IT IS IT'S A FEE PAID BY THE CONSUMER -- AS SAME AS THE EXISTING TIRE FEES ARE -- I CAN UNDERSTAND THE CONCERN THAT THE MANUFACTURER HAVE. ABOUT THE IMPACT ON THE THE CONSUMER DEMAND FOR THEIR PRODUCT BUT WE THINK IT'S REALLY A DE MINIMUS FEET. A DOLLAR FIFTY PER TIRE -- AND TYPICALLY FOLKS REPLACE THEIR TIRES ONCE EVERY FOUR YEARS SO IT'S ON AN ANNUALIZED COST ABOUT A DOLLAR. FIFTY PER PER YEAR -- IT IS DOES GO TO THE DOES GO TO THE CONSUMER. THERE'S BEEN -- QUESTION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S A WAY TO DIRECT THIS TO THE MANUFACTURER -- FRANKLY I WISH THERE WERE BECAUSE THEY'RE THE ONES THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ZINC THAT ENDS UP ON THE PUBLIC ROADWAYS AND IS WASHED INTO THE STORM WATER SYSTEM -- BUT RIGHT NOW THAT'S THAT'S THE MODEL IS THAT THIS IS A FEE THAT GOES ON ON TO THE TIREDNESS PAID BY THE CONSUMER. AND TO BE CLEAR I'M NOT OPPOSED TO A FEE ON THE CAUSE ON THE CONSUMER. I JUST FEEL THAT IT SHOULD BE SHARED WITH THE MANY FACTORS AS WELL AND NOT JUST ON THE CONSUMERS. I AGREE WHEN WE THINK ABOUT HOW OFTEN WE PLACER TIRES. CONSUMERS GIVING ME. FOURTEEN DOLLARS EVERY THREE TO FIVE YEARS -- NOT NOT TOO BAD I'LL BUT I DO THINK IN OFFERING AS WE NEED TO BE THINKINGOF THE POLITICAL WILL SO IT'S ALSO. BE SHARED WITH THE MANUFACTURE ALONG THE WAY. I AND SO IT'S NOT. AN OPPOSITION BUT I THINK AS WERE THINKING OF HIGHLIGHTED CREATING FUNDS AND GROWING APART THAT'S BIG ENOUGH -- OR ADDITIONAL RESOURCES I THINK WE NEED TO BE HAVING THAT DISCUSSION AS WELL. AND I'LL SECOND THE MOTION. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. OKAY WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. I JUST RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR THE COMMITTEES -- AYE VOTE -- IT IS. FOR CITIES THAT I REPRESENT -- VENDETTA REPRESENTED IN THE SECULAR VALLEY IN OTHER PARTS. THEY'RE SMALL CITIES AND THEY HAVE NOW BEEN SADDLED WITH AN MS FOUR PERMIT COSTS OF BUILDING. FACILITIES INFRASTRUCTURE THAT ESSENTIALLY COULD BANKRUPT THESE COMMUNITIES AND WE THINK THIS IS JUST A ONE SMALL ADDITIONAL EFFORT ALONG WITH THE PASSAGE OF MEASURE W. LAST FALL. THEY CAN HELP GET US THERE TO AT LEAST ADDRESS ISSUES THATWE ARE NOW MANDATED -- TO RESPOND TO SO HI WITHOUT I RESPECTFULLY ASK. I THINK IT WOULD NOT MAKE A ROLL CALL. ITEM EIGHTEEN AB SEVEN FIFTY FIVE BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER HOLDEN THE MOTION IS TO PASS A REFER TO COMMITTEE ON ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY AND TOXIC MATERIALS. MEMBERS FRIEDMAN HI FRIEDMAN I FLORA. CHAU.

JERRY OF FUNDS -- WE'RE LOOKING. AT MAKING SURE THEY WERE INCLUDING DAYTIME POPULATIONS ALONG THE BORDER REGIONS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ALASKA THIS BILL CAME BEFORE THE SAME COMMITTEE THERE WAS A LOT OF QUESTION ABOUT. HOW THIS COULD PERHAPS IMPACT -- AND MAKE IT -- NOT EQUITABLE FOR OTHER PARTS OF CALIFORNIA IF POSITIONING THE BORDER REGIONS TO COMPETE. BETTER FOR THESE FUNDS THE MESSAGE WAS. THAT -- THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LIVING ON THE BORDER AND COUNTY THAT THEY TIME POPULATIONS -- IS THAT. MEXICO CALIFORNIA REGIONS IN PRO COUNTY CYNICAL COUNTY CANNOT PARTNER -- TO ACCESS THESE DOLLARS WHEREAS OTHER COUNTIES WITHIN THE STATE. OTHER INNER AGENCIES CAN DO SO -- WE HAVE A GRAPH THAT WOULD LOVE TO SHARE IF NEED BE ON HOW THESE FUNDS HAVE BEEN DISTRIBUTED OVER THE COURSE OF TIME. AND IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT THE BORDER REGIONS HAVE NOT RECEIVED ITS FAIR SHARE OUR JOB. AS LEGISLATORS IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE BRING BACK YOU KNOW -- EQUAL SHARE OF FAIR SHARE TOWARD DISTRICTS AND AGAIN -- I CAN HI LIKE THAT WITH THE GRAPH OF IF NEEDED RESPECTFULLY ASK FREE I WOULD ON THIS BILL. A COUPLE WITNESSES THAT WILL SPEAK TO THE MATTER. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR FRIEDMAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME'S MATT DESERT AND I IN THE AIR POLLUTION CONTROL OFFICER FOR COUNTY. ON BEHALF OF IMPERIAL COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS THEY PEARL COUNTY AIR POLLUTION CONTROL DISTRICT I'M HERE TO EXPRESS OUR STRONG SUPPORT. OF AB. THREE FIFTY TWO THIS BILL WILL ENSURE THAT FUNDING FOR THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND REACHES COMMUNITIES LIKE IMPERIAL COUNTY SUFFERING FROM CUBA THE POPULATION BURDEN PURSUANT. TO THE COMMUNITY -- PROTECTION PROGRAM A. B. -- SIX SEVENTEEN COUNTY INCLUDE SEVERAL DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND IS ONE OF THE POOREST IN THE STATE SUFFERING FROM THE HIGHEST UNEMPLOYMENT RATE. UNHEALTHY AIR POLLUTION AND MORE THAN DOUBLE THE STATE'S RATE OF ASTHMA RELATED EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS AND HOSPITALIZATION OF CHILDREN. AS A MATTER OF FACT MOST OF THE COUNTY HAS A CALLIN VIRUS GREEN PERCENTILE OF 70% OR HIGHER. HOWEVER WE HAVE RECEIVED VERY LITTLE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUNDING OVER THE YEARS BECAUSE THE METHODOLOGY USES THE APPROPRIATE. FUNDING THAT NET VALUE WITH THE GRANT APPLICATIONS FAVORS COMMUNITIES THAT ARE DENSELY POPULATED. A UNIQUE FEATURE OF APPEAL COUNTY THAT ALSO POSES A CHALLENGE FOR US IN A DRESS AND OUR AIR QUALITY IS OUR LOCATION AS WE ARE ONE OF CALIFORNIA'S INTERNATIONAL GATEWAYS TO MEXICO. OUR RURAL SPARSELY POPULATED COMMITTEE SHARES A BORDER AN AIR BASE AND WITH THE DENSELY POPULATED CAPITAL BAJA CALIFORNIA THE CITY OF MEXICALI. COPULATION IS AT LEAST SEVEN TIMES THAT OF THE ENTIRE POPULATION OF IMPERIAL COUNTY. OUR NEIGHBORS CROSS THE BORDER ON A DAILY BASIS FOR VARIOUS REASONS AND WE IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY ARE FACED WITH THE CHALLENGE OF SERVING IN SUPPORTING SUCH A LARGE INFLUX AND POPULATION ON A DAILY BASIS. AB THREE FIFTY TWO CORRECT SAID IN EQUITY AND SIX TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO PROGRAMS FUNDED BY. THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND BY EXPANDING THE LIST OF CO BENEFITS AND ALLOWS THE COUNTIES OF IMPERIAL SAN DIEGO TO INCLUDE OUR DAYTIME POPULATION NUMBERS. AND THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND GRANT APPLICATIONS. THE BILL COUNTY NEEDS YOUR HELP TO MAKE ASSESSING THESE FUNDS MORE ACTIVE ROLE IN BIBLE. IN ADDITION TO THEIR DISTRICT IN THE COUNTY SUPPORT I'VE BEEN IN CONTACT WITH OUR LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE GROUP COMMITTEE CIVIC OF THEIR BY WITH LISA METAL. WHO HAD THE PLEASURE OF OF? BEING IN FRONT OF YOUR COMMITTEE LAST WEEK. HE'S ALSO IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL AND ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION AND THIS BILL AND I ASK YOU FOR YOUR AYE VOTE OR YOUR AFFIRMATIVE OF I WILL COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS ERICA FELL CHAIN ON THE GOVERNMENTAL PROJECTS MANAGER FOR THE COULD TELL THAT LEASES HAITIAN OF GOVERNMENTS. SEE BAG OF THE GOVERNMENTS REPRESENTING TEN CITIES TWO TRIBES IN THE COUNTY RIVERSIDE WE RECEIVED ONE OF ONLY TEN PLANNING GRANTS AWARDED IN THE FIRST ROUND OF THE TRANSFORMATIVE CLIMATE COMMUNITIES PROGRAM. AND WE WERE RECENTLY NOTIFIED THAT WE WILL BE ONE OF ONLY FIVE PLANNING GRANTS FUNDED IN THE SECOND ROUND AND TODAY WE'RE HERE TO SUPPORT THIS BILL. SEE BACK IN OUR MEMBERS HAVE BEEN COMMITTED TO HELPING CALIFORNIA CHIEF IT'S GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION GOALS BUT WE HAVE FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO EVEN COMPETE FOR SOME OF THE FUNDING PROGRAMS. WE SUPPORT THREE FIFTY TWO BECAUSE IT MAKES SEVERAL NECESSARY CHANGES TO PROGRAMS LIKE TCC. AB THREE FIFTY TWO BRANDS A LIST OF CO BENEFITS AS DEFINED BY THE STATE AIR RESOURCES BOARD AND IT HELPS ADDRESS SOME OF THE DENSITY CHALLENGES THAT REGION'S LIKE OURS FACE WHEN WE TRY TO APPLY FOR CAP AND TRADE FUNDING. THE COACHELLA VALLEY IS OFTEN SEEN AS AN AREA OF GREAT WEALTH BUT IN REALITY IT'S A SOCIO ECONOMIC DIVERSE REGION WITH AREAS OF EXTREME POVERTY PARTICULARLY IN THE EASTERN ON CORPORATE COMMUNITIES. UNFORTUNATELY THIS DIVERSITY IS NOT FULLY REFLECTED IN CALABAR SCREEN IN THE ENTIRE C. BACK REGION INCLUDING BOTH THE COACHELLA VALLEY VERDE VALLEY. THERE ARE ONLY EIGHT CENSUS TRACTS THAT RANK IN TOWN BY YOUR SCREEN'S TOP 25% THAT DEFINES ITS DISADVANTAGE. NOT A SINGLE CENSUS TRACK IN THE ENTIRE C. BACK REGION RANKS IN THE TOP 5%. OTHER MAPS INCLUDING AB FIFTEEN FIFTY ARE MUCH BETTER REFLECTION OF OUR SOCIO ECONOMIC DIVERSITY. AS IT STANDS NOW CALIBER SCREEN HAS A DIRECT IMPACT ON WHETHER OUR COMMUTES CAN EVEN APPLY FOR FUNDING. IF THEY CAN'T APPLY IT ALSO IMPACTS THEIR SCORE CONSIDER THE TCC PROGRAM. SEE BAG WILL BE A PARTNER ON TWO OF THE FIFTEEN GRANTS THAT ARE WERE WORDED FOR THE PLANNING FUNDS. AND WE'RE INVESTING TIME IN FUNDING INTO PREPARING FOR FUTURE ROUNDS OF IMPLEMENTATION GRANTS AND OTHER OPPORTUNITIES AND YET AS THE RULES ARE WRITTEN NOW NOT A SINGLE SENTENCE TRACK IN EITHER OF THOSE PLANNING CURRENT AREAS. COULD EVENQUALIFIED TO APPLY FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION FUNDING WE APPRECIATE YOUR CONSIDERATION AND HOPE YOU WILL JOIN US IN SUPPORTING THE SPELL. THANK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY FURTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. JAPANESE DEFAULT ON THE AT THE SAME PER DIEM COUNTY FOR SUPERVISORS ALSO IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. MARK ORDERS ARE NOT ACCEPTED EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF LUCK BUT IF YOU HAVE COME TO SEE THAT IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ARE THERE ANY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC IN OPPOSITION WANT TO SPEAK. OKAY WITHOUT WILL GO TO THE COMMITTEE. GARCIA -- THANK YOU I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE FOR BEING IN THIS FOR IT I'VE. VISITED THE CALEXICO MAKE IT BORDER AND GOT TO BE REMINDED OF THEIR QUALITIES AS IF YOU'RE A QUALITY ISSUES THERE BUT IT IS. A CONTEST AND WE HAVE TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE ON ONE SIDE OF THE BORDER AND A MILLION PEOPLE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BORDER AND ON THE DIFFICULT IS THAT THAT CREATES A THIRD DIFFERENT TOOLS OUT THERE TO TRY TO ADDRESS ISSUES -- I WOULDN'T BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T THINK ABOUT THE FACT THAT IN GENERAL WE HAVE AND THEN A VERY GOOD JOB OF GETTING DOLLARS INTO DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES OTHER THERE'S THERE'S ADVANTAGE. I DENSELY OR NOT MY DISTRICT IS ONE OF THE MOST DISADVANTAGED. AND WE HAVE BROUGHT IN SOME OF THE LEAST DOLLARS. OUT THERE.

I'M HERE TODAY TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL THREE EIGHTY THREE TO ESTABLISH A CLEAN ENERGY. FINANCING CLEARING HOUSE WITHIN THE OFFICE OF THE TREASURE. THIS OFFICE WOULD ACT AS A COORDINATOR OF THE TREMENDOUS PUBLIC INVESTMENT THE CALIFORNIA MAKES ANNUALLY THROUGH VARIOUS STATE AGENCIES AND PROGRAMS. A SIMILAR BILL IS RUN LAST YEAR BY SENATOR STERN WHO REQUESTED A REPORT FROM THE SENATE OFFICE OF RESEARCH. THE DOUBLE OF THE COMPLEXITIES OF OUR CLEAN ENERGY PROGRAMS THIS RESEARCH FOUND OVER FORTY DIFFERENT. FINANCIAL INCENTIVE PROGRAMS ADMINISTERED BY OVER FIFTEEN DIFFERENT OFFICES. ALL WITH THE GOAL OF DISCOVERING NEW PATHWAYS FOR CLEAN ENERGY. DESPITE BILLIONS IN PUBLIC DOLLARS THAT WE SPEND ANNUALLY. WE MUST MAKE SURE WE SPEND THOSE DOLLARS EFFICIENTLY AND ASSIST OUR PRIVATE CAPITAL PARTNERS TO BECOME MOBILIZE. IN ORDER TO MEET OUR GOALS FOR EXAMPLE. OF THE CQC RELEASED A STUDY DETERMINING THAT WILL TAKE APPROXIMATELY FOUR BILLION. ANNUALLY TO MEETS THE ENERGY EFFICIENCY TARGETS IDEALLY NEW TECHNOLOGY SPURRED THIS SPREAD BY THIS LEGISLATION. COMBINED WITH MARKET COMPETITION WILL HAVE TO DRIVE DOWN COSTS SB. THIRTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT STRUGGLE TO PROGRESS LAST YEAR DUE TO THE QUESTION OVER WHICH AGENCY WOOD MISTER THIS TASK. THIS YEAR THE CALIFORNIA STATE TREASURER'S OFFICE IS INTERESTED BUT THE NOTE -- IS NOT YET OFFICIALLY IN SUPPORT.

AND THEY LIVE SPRINKLED THROUGHOUT STATE GOVERNMENT WITH THEIR SIDE LOAD. THAT COORDINATION CAN BETTER SET UP CALIFORNIA FOR THE CRUCIAL SECOND STEP TO ATTRACT PRIVATE CAPITAL PARTNERS TO LEVERAGE SIGNIFICANT PRIVATE DOLLARS SO THERE'S A MUCH BIGGER POOLS OF MONEY TO ADDRESS CALIFORNIA'S CLEAN ENERGY NEEDS THAN JUST THE PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE FUNDED TO DATE.

THANK YOU AND I WOULD JUST LIKE TO COMMENT THAT I AGREE WITH YOU ABOUT THE ISSUE OF G. R. FUNDING -- IN GENERAL ON THE AMENDMENTS TO REMOVE THE JUROR FUNDING PORTION FROM THE BILL SO NOW THE BILL DOES NOT EXPRESSLY -- USE YOUR RIGHT NOW I'M MORE OF THAT BUT THAT'S PROBABLY THE ONLY SOURCE THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE VIABLE FOR SO IN THIS CASE WE HAVE A PROGRAM WITHOUT ANY FUNDING. AND WITHOUT NECESSARILY A MECHANISM TO TRY TO APPROACH THAT I DON'T THINK IT'S IT'S AN APPROPRIATE GENERAL FUND EXPENDITURE AGAIN CHOOSE YOUR OFFICE THAT THE LOGICAL PLACE FOR THIS TO GO WE SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT THESE KINDS OF PROGRAMS.

RIGHT TO CHI AYE STONE SO NO [inaudible] NINE ONE THANK YOU WOULD YOU LIKE TO PRESENT YOUR NEXT BILL. YES MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M PROUD TO PRESENT AB TWO THIRTY ONE A MEASURE DESIGNED TO INCREASE OUR STATE'S. COMMITMENT TO RECYCLED WATER. AS YOU ALL ARE WHERE OUR STATE IS PRONE TO FREQUENT AND DISASTERS DROUGHTS. SADLY IT'S OUR LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE. THAT ARE THE MOST AFFECTED. OUR LAST ROUTE RESULTED IN THE DISASTER IN ONE OF MY COMMUNITIES EAST PORTICO. AS MOST OF YOU ARE AWARE THE TOWN STILL HASN'T HAD RUNNING WATER IN FIVE YEARS. FAMILIES ARE STILL LEFT WITHOUT ACCESS TO CLEAN DRINKING WATER RUNNING WATER IN GENERAL. WE HAVE UNDERTAKEN MANY STEPS. TO GET THE TOWN CONNECTED TO NEIGHBORING PORTABLES WATER SYSTEMS HOWEVER THE PROCESS IS SLOW. ALTHOUGH WE ARE NEARING THE POINT WHERE EAST PORTABLE CAN RETURN TO SOME SENSE OF NORMALCY. SMALL LOW INCOME TOWNS LIKE THIS ONE ARE SEVERELY. UNDER PREPARED FOR THE NEXT DROUGHT. WE MUST ALWAYS LOOK AHEAD. A WHAT MIGHT BE FALL OR DISADVANTAGE. AND AT RISK COMMUNITIES ONE WAY THAT WE CAN BETTER PREPARE. FOR THE DISASTERS AHEAD. AND EVEN TO MITIGATE THEIR DAMAGES. THIS FOUND WITHIN AB. TWO THIRTY ONE TWENTY FIFTEEN THE LEGISLATURE ADOPTED SB EIGHTY EIGHT WITHIN THE LANGUAGE THERE. WAS A SEQUEL EXEMPTION FOR RECYCLED WATER FACILITIES AND TERTIARY TREATMENT PLANTS. WHY THIS EXEMPTION WAS VASTLY NEEDED THE SHORT SUNSET DATE ALONG WITH THE SPECIFIC REFERENCE TO THE DROUGHT? STATE OF EMERGENCY HAMPERED EFFORTS TO UTILIZE THE EXEMPTION FOR THE EXPANSION OF THESE FACILITIES UNFORTUNATELY NO NEWS FACILITIES WERE ABLE. TO CAPITALIZE ON THE SEQUEL EXEMPTION BECAUSE OF THE SHORT TIME FRANK. MY MAJOR SEEKS TO ENSURE THAT ANY FUTURE. DROUGHTS. WHICH IS SO SEVERE AS TO MERIT A DECLARATION OF OUR EMERGENCY BY THE GOVERNOR SHOULD RECEIVE THIS EXEMPTION. MEMBERS THIS IS VERY SIMPLE. WE HAVE AND NEED TO GET THESE PLANTS UP IN THESE FACILITIES OPERATING. AND IT JUST MAKES IT WHERE IF THE GOVERNOR DEEMS IT A STATE OF EMERGENCY WERE ALLOWED TO MOVE THROUGH. AND CUT THROUGH THE RED TAPE AND GIVE PEOPLE WHAT THEY NEEDED. I SIMPLY ASK YOU FOR EITHER. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES AND SUPPORT. ARE THERE ANY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WISHING TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE BRENNAN DAWSON WAS SIERRA CLUB -- SIERRA CLUB CALIFORNIA OPPOSES AB TWO THIRTY ONE IN OUR VIEW IT'S UNNECESSARY AND IT'S DESIGNED SO WHICH PREVENT THE PUBLIC PARTICIPATION PROCESS IS THAT C. PROVIDES. TO LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. AB TWO THIRTY ONE WOULD PROVIDE A SECRET EXEMPTION WHERE ONE IS NOT NECESSARY THE CALIFORNIA EMERGENCY SERVICES ACT ALREADY AUTHORIZES THE GOVERNOR DURING A STATE OF EMERGENCY TO ISSUE A PROCLAMATION. OF A STATE OF EMERGENCY IN SUSPEND ANY REGULATORY STATUTE WITH IT TOOK GOVERNOR DETERMINES AND DECLARES THE STRICT COMPLIANCE WITH THE STATUTE HINDER. ANY WAY TO PREVENT. OR HINDER OR DIGIT DELAY THE MITIGATION AFFECTS OF AN EMERGENCY SO AS SUCH YOU THIRTY ONE WOULD PROVIDE A SECRET EXEMPTION FOR ACTIVITIES THAT ARE ALREADY SUBJECT TO POTENTIAL EXPEDITED REVIEW. MOREOVER THE BILL PORTS EQUALS PUBLIC PARTICIPATION REQUIREMENTS AS WE KNOW SEEKER REQUIRES PROJECTS TO BE ANALYZED IN A REPORT AND THAT UNDERSTANDING MINUTE -- TO UNDERSTAND A MITIGATE THEIR ENVIRONMENT IMPACTS AND IT PROVIDES CRITICAL PUBLIC OVERSIGHT. THEY NEVER IT INEVITABLY LEADS TO BETTER INSISTING COMMUNITIES FOR ALL OF US EXEMPTION FOR SEQUEL UNLESS NARROWLY TAILORED SEVERELY LIMIT A COMMUNITIES PARTICIPATION IN GOVERNMENT PROCESS. AND DECISIONS ARE LIKELY TO HAVE SIGNIFICANT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS COMPLETELY SERVICE CIRCUMVENTING SEE BECAUSE TRUE INTENTION AND INTENDED PURPOSE. AND LASTLY THE SEQUEL PROCESS WE COULD PROVIDE A LEARNING OPPORTUNITY WHEN IT COMES OR CYCLE WATER. FOR THE PUBLIC RECYCLED WATER BY THE DROUGHT RESISTANT WATER SOURCE THAT CALIFORNIA SHOULD MOVE TOWARDS AND BECOME MORE RESILIENT SUSTAINABLE IN FUTURE THAT'S WERE -- MY ORGANIZATION IN THE SOME MEMBERS AGREE. HOWEVER THERE ARE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC THAT ARE NOT -- THAT ARE AWARE THAT RECYCLE WATER ALSO HAS CHALLENGES AND MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC ARE WARY OF RECYCLED WATER USE AND NEEDED NEED TO BE INFORMED OF ITS ANTI. OF ITS BENEFITS PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT ENVIRONMENTAL MITIGATION THAT SECRETIVE RIDES BY GIVING WAY THIS NECESSARY ON THIS NECESSARY INFORMATION CAN HELP YOU GET THE PUBLIC ON BOARD WITH RECYCLED WATER. FOR SUCH IMPORTANT IMPLEMENTATION IN A WAY THAT'S ON SAFELY WITH THAT WE OPPOSE C. A. B.. TWO THIRTY ONE THANK YOU ANY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WHO WISH TO VOICE THEIR OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. SEEING NONE OUR TURN -- TO MISTER MATHIS FOR ANY CLOSING COMMENTS OR ACTUALLY ANY COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. OF QUESTIONS. I'LL JUST -- SAY THAT I CAN'T SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY I UNDERSTAND -- THAT YOU HAVE VERY GOOD MOTIVATIONS WITH THIS BUT I AGREE WITH THEM -- REPRESENTATIVE SINCE YOUR CLUB THAT GIVEN THAT WE HAVE DONE THIS DURING THE LAST DROUGHT AND IT WASN'T USED BY ANY WATER AGENCY AND THAT WERE IT NOT IN DROUGHT CURRENTLY. AND THIS IS A PERFECT TIME FOR THE AGENCIES YOU TALK ABOUT THAT FEEL THAT THEY HAVE ISSUES WITH WATER AND WANT TO DO THE RECYCLE PROJECTS TO GO AHEAD AND DO THEIR SUPER PROCESS AND DO THE ENVIRONMENTAL WORK THAT. THESE PROJECTS REALLY SHOULD DO TO INVITE THE PUBLIC DISSIPATION -- IT'S HARD FOR ME. TO PASS SOMETHING ANTICIPATING SOMETHING IN THE FUTURE WHEN I CAN'T REALLY QUANTIFY EXACTLY WHAT THE BARRIER IS. SO THAT'S MY POSITION I AS ANYBODY ELSE HAVE ANY -- COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. OKAY WITH THAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE ABSOLUTELY MADAM CHAIR YOU KNOW EVERY EFFORT. TO MOVE -- EMERGENCY DRINKING WATER.

THERE'S YOU KNOW THERE THERE'S A STADIUM IN OAKLAND THAT'S GOING TO BE BUILT ON THE WATERFRONT DELICIOUS WAY SHE WILL. FOR WHEN WE LOOK AT OUR NEW BUILDING HERE. FOR FOR THE NEW ANNEX FOR OUR OWN OFFICES ALL THIS IS WHERE SHE WILL FOR THAT. WHEN IT COMES TO WATER? FOR FAMILIES THAT HAVE GONE WITHOUT. IT'S A WE WE CAN'T DO THAT WE NEED TO SLOW DOWN THE PROCESS AND AND QUITE FRANKLY I'M SICK OF IT MEMBERS. WATER IS THAT VITAL THING THAT WE NEED.

UP HERE WITH PARENTS LITTLE KIDS YOU MAY KNOW IF YOU GONE TO A RESTAURANT AFTER THE MEAL. YOU HAVE SOME RECYCLING OR SOME FOOD TO TAKE CARE OF AFTERWARDS AND USUALLY THERE'S ONLY ONE BIT.

THIS IS A GREAT PLACE TO START WE KNOW THAT SOME RESTAURANTS ARE ALREADY DOING THIS AND WE'LL BE WORKING WITH THEM. TO STEP IT UP AND HELP FOCUS OTHER RESTAURANTS DOING THE SAME THING THIS WILL HELP REDUCE OUR GHGS HELP CALIFORNIANS LEARN HOW TO PROPERLY SORT THEIR WASTE AND RECYCLED. AND ALLOW ALL OF US TO MAKE SMARTER CLIMATE CHOICES I WITH ME TODAY IS CALIFORNIANS AGAINST WASTE THE SPONSOR THIS MEASURE THANK YOU. I CAPTION AGAIN THE COLLAPSE OF CALIFORNIANS AGAINST WASTE.

LAST FALL. THE STORIES WE HEARD IN THOSE FOCUS GROUPS -- INCLUDING THOSE OF YOUNG FARMERS HAVE EXPERIENCED COP FAILURES -- AND SIGNIFICANT LOSSES IN THEIR PRODUCTION. AS WELL AS FROM FARMERS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY STRUGGLING TO DECIDE WHAT TO PLANT IN THE DECADES TO COME. UNDERSCORES THAT FARMERS RANCHERS ARE ALREADY EXPERIENCING AND HAVING TO MANAGE THE RISKS OF CLIMATE CHANGE. THE STATE IS INVESTED A LOT OF MONEY AND RESEARCH TO BETTER UNDERSTAND AG'S VULNERABILITIES AND SOLUTIONS -- BUT OUR FOCUS GROUPS REVEALED THAT NOT ENOUGH HAS BEEN DONE TO TRANSLATE AND PACKAGE THAT INFORMATION. INTO -- ACCESSIBLE PRACTICAL TOOLS AND TRAINING FOR PRODUCERS. SUCH ELABORATE ON THAT NEED HAVE INVITED OUT DOCTORED TOUGH ON POLITICS -- UC COOPERATIVE EXTENSION SPECIALIST BASED EASY MERCED. AND AN EXPERT IN APPLIED CLIMATE SCIENCE AND AGRICULTURE TO ELABORATE ON THE NEED THANK YOU. GET YOUR AND A MEMBER OF THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY THE IMPORTANCE OFTEN DEVELOPMENT UP ADAPTATION DECISION SUPPORT TOOLS. TO MAKE CALIFORNIA'S AGRICULTURE MORE RESILIENT TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND CLIMATE RELATED RISKS FROM NEAR NUMEROUS -- CREDIBLE REPORTS RESEARCH AND PUBLICATION INCLUDING THE ONE THAT WE PUBLISHED RECENTLY IN DURING THE GROUND ME. AT TITLE CLIMATE CHANGE TRYING TO IMPACTS ON CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE DETAILED REVIEW. IT IS EVIDENT THAT CLIMATE CHANGE POSES SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES TO CALIFORNIA'S HIGHLY PRODUCTIVE ACCEPTOR. DESPITE RESEARCH EFFORTS WE ARE OFTEN CHALLENGED WITH TRANSLATING RESEARCH INTO ACTIONABLE INFORMATION RESOURCES AND TOOLS. TO ASSIST GROWERS TO MAKE STRATEGIC DECISIONS FOR EXAMPLE US GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE REPORT. ON CLIMATE CHANGE IN TWENTY FOURTEEN MENTIONED THAT USDA PIECES CHALLENGES. OF TURNING THE LARGE AMOUNT OF OFTEN TECHNICAL CLIMATE RESEARCH INTO READY UNDERSTANDABLE INFORMATION. ONE OF THE LEADING RECOMMENDATIONS AND CDFA IS CLIMATE CAN CONSORTIUM FOR SPECIALTY CROPS REPORT WAS TO COMPILE GROWERS NEEDS ARE PROVIDE THE DATA AND FORECASTS PRODUCTS TO ASSIST WITH DECISION MAKING. THERE'S A CLEAR AN IMMEDIATE NEED FOR DEVELOPING LOCAL DEVELOPMENT -- CROP SPECIFIC AGRA CLIMATE DECISION SUPPORT TOOLS AND DISSEMINATION PROCESS DESIGNED TO GIVE A COMPETITIVE EDGE TO INCREASE PRODUCTIVITY REDUCING RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH BOTH VERY ABILITY AND CHANGE OUR CLIMATE RUDY AND CHANGE. THIS TYPE OF EFFORT HAS BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL IN SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES AS WELL AS IN THE CENTRAL U. S. -- THOSE THOSE -- DECISION SUPPORT -- TOOLS ARE CALL AGRO CLIMATE DOT ORG AND AT CLIMATE FOR YOU DOT ORG. AND TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE AND KNOWLEDGE OF SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES THERE IS NOTHING SIMILAR TO THAT EXISTING CALIFORNIA AND SO SIMPLY DEVELOPING THIS TOOL IS NOT ENOUGH. IT'S IMPORTANT TO INVOLVED -- AGRICULTURAL CLIENTELE FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE PROCESS UP TO DEVELOPMENT ENSURE WILD WOOD BY ABILITY AND INCREASED USABILITY OF THE STALLS.
