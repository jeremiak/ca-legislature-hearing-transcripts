THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS AB THREE THREE FIVE ALLOWS MANUFACTURERS OF RECREATIONAL BOATS THE MARINE ENGINES TO RECEIVE AND RETAIN SPECIFIC CONTACT INFORMATION. FOR BUYERS OF ITS PRODUCTS FOR THE LIMITED AND EXCLUSIVE USE OF CONDUCTING PRODUCT SAFETY RECALLS AND WARRANTY VERIFICATION. UNDER CURRENT LAW THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND PROPOSITION TWENTY FOUR. APPROVED BY THE VOTERS IN TWENTY TWENTY ESTABLISHED CONSUMER PRIVACY AND PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION MEASURES AMONG THE CENTRAL PROVISIONS OF THESE LANDMARK LAWS IS THE RIGHT OF CONSUMERS TO REQUEST THE DELETION. OF THEIR PERSONAL INFORMATION OR OPT OUT OF DATA COLLECTION AND TO REQUIRE BUSINESSES TO COMPLY WITH SUCH REQUESTS. AS DIFFERENT PARTIES HAVE A VALUE WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF CONSUMER PRIVACY LAWS INSTANCES HAVE EMERGED FOR CLASSIFICATION IS NECESSARY TO ENSURE THAT BUSINESSES CAN MAINTAIN. CONSUMER DATA TO PROTECT CONSUMER SAFETY BY RECALLING AND REPAIRING DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS ONE OF THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES INVOLVES WARRANTY AND RECALL REPAIRS WHICH REQUIRE SHARING OF CONSUMER DATA BETWEEN THE DEALER. AND THE MANUFACTURER OF THE PRODUCT. CURRENTLY BOTH EMERY ENGINE STEELER OFFENSE BUYER CONTACT INFORMATION THE PRODUCT MANUFACTURED. MANUFACTURES USE THIS INFORMATION TO VERIFY WARRANTY ELIGIBILITY AND TO CONDUCT SAFETY RECALLS DEALERS USE THIS DATA TO VERIFY THE PRODUCTS OWNERSHIP IN ELIGIBILITY AT THE POINT OF REPAIR. AB THREE THREE FIVE WILL PROVIDE MANUFACTURES THE LEGAL CERTAINTY THEY NEED TO COLLECT AND RETAIN THIS INFORMATION IS TO USE IT TO PERFORM SAFETY RECALLS. WHILE BENEFITING CONSUMERS WHO PURCHASE THEIR PRODUCTS WITH THIS LIMITED USE OF DATA. BY ALLOWING THIS LIMITED SHARING OF INFORMATION CONSUMERS TO BUY PRODUCTS SUCH AS VESSELS OR MARINE ENGINES WILL RECEIVE IMPORTANT AND TIMELY SAFETY RECALL INFORMATION. AND EASILY CONFORM WARRANTY VERIFICATION EIGHTY THREE THREE FIVE WITH SPECIFIC SPECIFICALLY DOES NOT ALLOW THE USE OF THIS INFORMATION FOR ANY OTHER PURPOSE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR IPHONE. TODAY WE HAVE WITH US IN THE REMOTE LOCATION ROOM MARK SMITH A LOBBYIST FOR THE NATIONAL MARINE MANUFACTURERS ASSOCIATION SPONSORS OF THIS BILL. AND ON THE LINE JOEL MANIC KOLKO MARINE SERVICE DIVISION. MANAGER YAMAHA IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. THANK YOU SOME OF THEM I SEE MRS. IN THE GALLERY MISTER SMITH- FLOOR'S YOURS. THANK YOU MR CHAIR. MARK SMITH ON BEHALF OF THE NATIONAL MARINE MANUFACTURERS ASSOCIATION ON THE FACE OF IT THIS BILL IS EXACTLY IDENTICAL TO ONE APPROVED UNANIMOUSLY BY THE LEGISLATURE IN TWENTY NINETEEN. WHICH DEALT WITH THIS ISSUE WITH THE VEHICLE DEALERS AND VEHICLE MANUFACTURERS. THIS IS THE SAME CONCEPT BUT FOR VESSELS. THE CONCERN WE HAVE AS AND SO MANY FRACTURES IS THAT WE'RE IN A GRAY AMBIGUOUS AREA HERE WE HAVE A FEDERAL REQUIREMENT TO ENACT. RECALL IN SAFETY WARRANTIES AND WE HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT WHICH STATES THAT. BUSINESSES MAY NOT SHARE THE DATA THAT IS NECESSARY TO COMPLETE THIS FEDERAL TRANSACTION. SO ON THE SURFACE THIS IS AN IMPORTANT BILL THAT WILL ALLOW OUR COMPANIES TO COMPLY WITH FEDERAL RECALL AND WARRANTY MANDATES. THE OPPONENTS OF THE MEASURE WILL TELL YOU THAT THE PROPOSITION TWENTY FOUR REQUIRES IT ALL NEW LEGISLATION IN THIS AREA BE PASSED ONLY IF IT FURTHERS THE INTERESTS OF CONSUMER PROTECTION SO TO THAT. WE SAY THAT THIS BILL DOES THAT BECAUSE FOR THE FIRST TIME NOW IT WILL RESTRICT THE USE OF THIS DATA. FOR THE EXCLUSIVE PURPOSE OF RECALL MORE T. MANUFACTURE WILL NO LONGER BE ABLE TO USE THE DATA TO SAY HEY YOU BOUGHT MY BOAT IN TWENTY FIFTEEN. WOULD YOU LIKE TO BUY MY TWENTY TWENTY ONE VERSION OR TO MARKET THAT INFORMATION TO SOMEBODY ELSE SO THIS BILL DOES GO A STEP FURTHER IN PROTECTING CONSUMER DATA. WILL ADDITIONALLY SAY THAT IF WE DON'T GET THE DATA FROM A DEALER WE HAVE A FEDERAL OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE THIS SERVICE WE WILL BE FORCED TO GO TO THIRD PARTY DATA VENDORS TO TRY TO ASSEMBLE. THIS INFORMATION SO BY ALLOWING THE SHARING OF INFORMATION ALLOWING THIS CLARIFICATION WILL BE CUTTING DOWN ON THE NEED TO GO TO THIRD PARTY DATA VENDORS. WHICH IS ALSO A BENEFIT TO CONSUMERS AND CONSUMER PRIVACY WE ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER SMITH AND I WAS REMISS IN NOT ANNOUNCING.

I ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE TODAY BECAUSE EIGHTY THREE THIRTY FIVE REPRESENTS A STEP BACKWARD FOR CONSUMER PRIVACY AND IT CONSTITUTES AN UNCONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHT BACK TO TWENTY TWENTY THE INITIATIVE KNOWN AS PROPOSITION TWENTY FOUR ON THE BALLOT LAST NOVEMBER. LOOKING AT YOU KNOW THE BALLOT INITIATIVES CAN BE AMENDED BY THE LEGISLATURE ONLY WHEN THEIR TERMS PERMIT THOSE AMENDMENTS. AND PROPERTY FOR PUT IN PLACE A SIMPLE RESTRICTION ON AMENDING CALIFORNIA PRIVACY LAW YOU CAN ONLY AMEND IT TO ENHANCE CONSUMER PRIVACY. IT'S A ONE WAY RATCHET WHERE PRIVACY ONE CALIFORNIA. ONLY GOT STRONGER OVER TIME. THE MORE COMPUTERS IN THE TEXT OF THE INITIATIVE. IN THE VOTER GUIDE. MUNITIONS THAT WAS FOR TO THE- I WAS REPEATING UPSIDE. OVER THE COURSE OF THE PUB DISCUSS. I PROP. TWENTY ON THE MENTAL PURPOSE OF THE INITIATIVE WITH THIS. CONSUMER MAKE AMENDMENTS YOU CAN OCCUR. AND POSSIBLE BUT WITHOUT ANOTHER IMAGE. THIRTY THREE THIRTY FIVE AND FORTY IS NOT IT'S A WITH RESTRICTION ELIMINATE THE PRIVACY RIGHTS SPECIFICALLY THE RYE. FOR PEOPLE TO OPT OUT OF THE INFORMATION BEING SOLD OUT FOR SOMEONE FROM- SO IT'S- WITH METALS BUSTLING. DOESN'T THE DIPLOMAT PURPOSE ENHANCING PRIVACY AND THEREFORE IT'S NOT A PERMISSIBLE THAT BUT CALIFORNIA PRIVACY LAW. AS FOR THE NEW THAT FEDERAL LAW. THAT IS ACTUALLY A- AND TWO FOUR DRESSING PREEMPTION BY FEDERAL LAW NUCOR ORDER THAT- THE STAY LAWS PRINTED AND HERE THERE'S NO ORDER TO AMENDMENT. BILL CORRECTION. IT'S NOT APPROPRIATE. THIS BILL IS ALSO NOT MESSAGE. BUT NOTHING STOPPED THE BOAT DEALER FROM. WITH ABOUT A ABOUT WARRANTY OR FROM. AND WOMEN THIS IS ABOUT HONORING POPPED. FOR PERSON EXPLICITLY SAYS THEY DON'T WANT THEIR INFORMATION TO BE SOLD. RESPECTFULLY ASK TO KNOW ABOUT. THANK YOU SIR OTHERS MY NUMBER TWENTY SEVEN. THANK YOU MR CHAIR LINE NUMBER TWENTY SEVEN YOUR LINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS DANIEL GUTIERREZ ON BEHALF OF THE CONSUMER FEDERATION OF CALIFORNIA A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION THAT ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS FOR OVER SIXTY YEARS I'M NOT UNFORTUNATELY OPPOSED AB THREE THREE FIVE. GENERALLY THE CONSUMER FEDERATION SUPPORTS PROVIDING CONSUMERS WITH GREATER INFORMATION AND DISCLOSURE WHEN IT COMES TO RECALLS AND WARRANTY ISSUES HOWEVER EIGHTY THREE THREE FIVE. SO IN A WAY THAT IS INCONSISTENT WITH PROPERTY FOR. WHICH VOTERS PASSED LAST YEAR AND ATTEMPTS TO ADDRESS THE HYPOTHETICAL PREEMPTION ISSUE WHICH DOES NOT EXIST YET AND LIKELY NEVER WILL. TWENTY FOUR CLEARLY STATES THAT CALIFORNIA PRIVACY LAW CAN ONLY BE AMENDED TO QUOTE ENHANCED PRIVACY. THE PROPONENTS OF PROPOSITION REPEATEDLY ARGUED THAT THE INITIATIVE WILL PREVENT THE TAKING OF AMENDMENTS WE CAN PRINT THE PROTECTION LOOKING FOR A- SPECIAL EXEMPTION SOUGHT BY THE BOOK INDUSTRY IN EIGHTY THREE THREE FIVE WOULD NOT ENHANCE PRIVACY BUT INSTEAD OF ELIMINATING PRIVACY RIGHTS THAT ALLOW CONSUMERS. OFTEN FAIL OTHER PRIVATE INFORMATION. LIMITED BILLBOARD IN THIS WAY COULD SEND A SIGNAL FOR FUTURE CHANGES TO THE LAW BY USING UP ALL POLITICAL THE THIRD COMBA A LOT. UP TWENTY FOUR IS ALSO CLEAR THAT IT CAN CAN BE AMENDED TO ADDRESS A CALIFORNIA- FEDERAL COURT RULING. AND THE MERE POSSIBILITY OF FEDERAL PREEMPTION IN THE FUTURE. DOES NOT PROVIDE. THE OPPOSITION COLD HOW PROVIDED ME ALL CAN AND- WITH CLEAR LANGUAGE THAT WOULD HAVE. ALL OF THESE. LEAVING CROP FOR FOUR ON. POSSIBLE TELLING BILL. I'M FORTY THAT PROPOSAL NOT ACCEPT. AND WE'RE LEFT WITH A BILL THAT BELIEVE CONFLICT WITH THE TELLER OF THE PROPERTY. FIFTY PER ACTIVITY. THANK COMPLICATE FUTURE EFFORTS THE BAND. AGAIN WE CAN THE LAW FOR THESE REASONS ARE CREDIT. OF THE NEED FOR THREE FIVE AND A CURRENT FORM AND ASK FOR NO. FOR THE BILL BE AMENDED ALL THE- THANK YOU THANK YOU. MODEL ANYONE ELSE IN OPL ON THE PHONE LINE. EVERY TIME OF DAY CARE WE HAVE NO ELSE E. G. ARE LET'S BRING IT BACK TO THE CHAIN- DISCUSS COM YOU SIR WHAT KOWSKI. THANK YOU MR- I DON'T WANNA ROCK BOAT HERE BECAUSE IT'S THIS BILL IS. THIS BILL IS WELL WHAT BUT DONE SOONER BECAUSE HE- BUT- THE- CAN. DATA ALL OR PROPONENTS- THE AUTHOR SAID INDICATED THAT THEY'VE NEVER. WHAT THE CONCERN DATA CAN BE USED FOR IS. IT BE USED TO SELL. TRANS SINCE SORT OF THE FOLLOW UP WITH LET ME FIX YOUR BOAT OR LET ME DO THIS- JUST GIVING THEM THE WARNING. I A CLEAR FOR FROM THE- FROM THE AUTHOR IF THAT ISN'T IN FACT THIS NARROW NARROWING. OF WHAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY RECEIVE IT SHE SAID THAT. BOAT IS BROKEN. YES SEVEN MEMBER BANNER OR WEST BERMUDA WE'RE NOT BANNER BURNER BURNER YEAH YES THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT SO CAN ONLY BE USED FOR INFORMING THE CONSUMER OF RECALL AND WARRANTY ISSUES WE DON'T WANT EXPLORING BOTH ON OUR WATERWAYS AND I THINK THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT AND I HEARD THE OPPOSITION SPEAK ALSO OF SALE OF DATA THIS DOES NOT PROVIDE FOR THE SALE OF DATA THIS PROVIDES ONLY FOR MANUFACTURERS. WILL CONTACT CONSUMERS IN THE CASES OF WARRANTY AND RECALL. SIX I MEAN I MISS I WORK OUT THIS I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE BALLOT THE STERN IS SO I'M NOT I'M NOT SINCE I'M NOT PROFESSING I UNDERSTAND HE'S NOT A FULL. TERMS BUT THE OTHER. CAN THAT I HAD IS ON FED PREEMPTION. BECAUSE BECAUSE AS I READ. THE PROPOSITION NO IT'S I'M LOOKING AT THE TOP OF PAGE EIGHT WE HAVE IS TO FURTHER CONSUMER RIGHTS WHICH INCLUDE THE PRIVACY RIGHTS AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THIS NOTICE. TO GIVE VESSEL OWNERS INFORMATION THAT YOUR- ENGINE MAY BREAK DOWN IS. FOUNDATIONAL FOR- THE CONSUMER RIGHTS ACT I'M- I'D LIKE THE CLARIFICATION OF THE OPPOSITION IS SAID THAT YOU NEED A COURT ORDER FIRST IN ORDER TO GO THROUGH THE PROCESS OF GETTING COMPLYING WITH FEDERAL LAW. AND MY READING OF THE CONSTITUTION IS THE SUPREME X. THE CLAUSE WOULD SAY THAT THAT WOULD BE NON BINDING. AND WHAT THE AUTHOR IS IT TRUE THAT WE NEED A COURT ORDER IN ORDER TO HAVE- TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS NOTIFICATION THAT- I GUESS AB THREE THREE FIVE IS TRYING TO DO THIS SHE GREW WITH THAT. ANALYSIS OF THE OPPOSITION. SAN JUAN CASKEY IT IS THAT A QUESTION TO THE OPPOSITION WITNESSES OR TO THE AUTHORS NO TO THE AUTHOR AND THE OPPOSITION ASSERTS THAT THAT ARTIST YOU CAN'T. YOU CAN'T NOTIFY CONSUMERS UNLESS YOU GET A COURT ORDER EXEMPTING EVEN THEN THAT WOULD TRIGGER THE- CPR EIGHT. SEVEN NUMBER. BOEHNER HOWEVER THANK YOU- I DO NOT AGREE WITH THE OPPOSITION ON THAT POINT SENATOR MCCASKEY. ALL RIGHT. OTHER QUESTIONS THERE WERE CASKEY NO MY I'M I DO NOT WANNA LEAVE ANYBODY IN MY WEIGHT ON THIS MATTER AND I THINK I'VE ASKED ALL THE QUESTIONS I NEED ALL RIGHT HERE THANK YOU I APPRECIATE YOU NOT CONTINUE TO ROCK THE BOAT. SERVICE WORK. THANK YOU SOMEONE WHO SPENT OVER THREE HUNDRED HOURS IN THE NEGOTIATION AND DRAFTING OF TUG OF PROPOSITION TWENTY FOUR. BUT THIS IS PRECISELY WHAT WE WERE CONSIDERING I'M TRYING TO FIND SECTION THREE HERE. IF I COULD JUST TALKS ABOUT AMENDMENTS TO THE SECTION TWENTY FIVE THE TALKS ABOUT AMENDMENTS CONCERNING CONSUMER RIGHTS. BUT THE ACTUAL SECTION THREE WHICH TALKS ABOUT WHAT CONSUMER RIGHTS AREN'T RESPONSIBLE BUSINESSES IT'S BEACH PROBABLY OF ALL THE THINGS THAT WE HAD WITH SOME OF THE OPPONENTS HERE WHO ALSO OPPONENTS TO PROBE TO PROP TWENTY FOUR. THAT THEY ARGUED ABOUT SAYING THAT THE LANGUAGE OF SECTION. THREE WHICH DEFINES- THE DEFINITION OF CONSUMER RIGHTS WAS TOO BROAD. BECAUSE AS I SUGGESTED OF ALL THE DISCUSSION WE HAD IN DRAFTING. A PROPOSITION TWENTY FOUR THAT THIS WAS ONE OF THE SECTIONS THAT WAS THE MOST DIFFICULT AND I'M TRYNG TO FIND IT. BUT I DON'T THINK I CAN. AT THIS TIME BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT IN MY VIEW I STRONGLY STAND IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE THAT IS COMPLETELY CONSISTENT WITH WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO. THIS IS NOT ANYTHING ABOUT. DOING OTHER THAN PROTECTING CONSUMERS THAT'S THE IDEA HERE IT'S PRIVACY AND CONSUMERS AND HERE'S A CONSUMER THAT COULD BE SUBJECT TO SOME TYPE OF RECALL AND THAT HAS TO BE SOME DOLLARS PROVISION. MY RECOLLECTION ALTHOUGH I HAVEN'T REREAD THIS IN SOME PRETTY TIME IS THAT WE HAD A VERY SIMILAR PROVISION HERE WITH RESPECT TO AUTOMOBILES. AND THE OPPONENTS THIS DIDN'T OBJECT TO THAT THIS JUST EXTENDS THE SAME PROVISIONS TO. THE BOAT SO I THINK IT'S COMPLETELY CONSISTENT TITLE TWENTY FOUR IT'S COMPLETELY CONSISTENT WITH THE MEASURE WE PASSED IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. AND I STRENGTH FROM HIS BOOK. THE USERS WORK SAYING NO OTHER MICHAEL RAISED- SALUTE THEM BORDER HER YOU CAN CLOSE I RESPECT ASK FOR YOUR I. R. IS MOTIONS. SO KIRBY SAID A COUPLE MOCAMBO. MEANT SHE KILLED THE CALL ROLL.

THIRTEEN NINETY ONE FILE NUMBER THREE AB THIRTEEN NINETY ONE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MISTER CHAIR AND SENATORS AT THIRTEEN NINETY ONE SERVES AS AN EFFECTIVE FIRST STEP. IN ADDRESSING THE GROWTH OF THE HACKED DATA MARKETPLACE. BY MAKING CLEAR THAT NO ONE CAN KNOWINGLY SELL PURCHASE OR UTILIZE HACKED DATA. TODAY WE LIVE IN DIGITALLY CONNECTED WORLD WHERE MORE PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS TO THE INTERNET. THAN EVER BEFORE. FURTHER ADMITTED TO PANDEMICS INTERNET ACCESS HAS QUICKLY BECOME A BASIC NECESSITY FOR ALL ASPECTS OF LIFE. HOWEVER AS MANY MORE PEOPLE USE COMPUTERS AND THE INTERNET TO CRIMINALS HAVE ALSO HAVE MORE. OPPORTUNITIES TO HACK INFORMATION IN THE FIRST HALF OF TWENTY NINETEEN IN FACT. DATA BREACHES EXPOSED FOUR POINT ONE BILLION RECORDS. YEAH IN THE FIRST HALF OF TWENTY TWENTY THIRTY SIX BILLION RECORDS WERE EXPOSED. THESE TYPES OF CYBERCRIMES RANGE FROM BREAKING INTO ONE'S COMPUTER NETWORK TO STEALING FINANCIAL INFORMATION TO OTHER CRIMES SUCH AS A CORPORATE ESPIONAGE. FRAUD AND EXTORTION. CURRENT LOCAL. COMPUTER HACKING AND STEALING INFORMATION IN ALL FORMS NEVERTHELESS SOME COMPANIES HAVE SEIZED THE OPPORTUNITY TO TURN A PROFIT BY SELLING DATA ORIGINALLY OBTAINED BY HACKERS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THIRD PARTIES. FOR EXAMPLE THE NEWS RECENTLY REPORTED ON A COMPANY THAT SELLS ACCESS TO BREACHED PERSONAL DATA INCLUDING TO LAW ENFORCEMENT. AS A STATE THAT IS HOME TO SOME OF THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE LAWS PROTECTING YOUR TRONIC COMMUNICATIONS WHEN AND WHERE THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY IS ENSHRINED IN OUR CONSTITUTION. CALIFORNIA SHOULD LEAD THE WAY IN STOPPING THE RISE OF HACKED DATA MARKETPLACE. AB THIRTEEN NINETY ONE WILL MAKE IT UNLAWFUL FOR A PERSON TO SELL PURCHASE OR UTILIZE DATA AS DEFINED THAT THE PERSON KNOWS OR REASONABLY SHOULD KNOW IS COMPROMISED DATA.

PUTS ALL THIS DATA ON THE INTERNET THEY'RE NOT TRYING TO MAKE ANY MONEY OFF OF IT IS THAT GOING TO BE PROTECTED UNDER. PAR NIKKI IN THE SOLOMON R. CASES. SO NUMBER CHILD GET A RESPONSE SURE THANKS FOR THE QUESTION THE POOR NEED T. CASE ESSENTIALLY IS A TWO THOUSAND ONES R. U. S. SUPREME COURT'S CASE WHICH I HELD THAT. FIRST AMENDMENT PROVIDES PROTECTION TO SPEECH THAT THIS CLOSES THE CONTENT OF ILLEGALLY INTERCEPTED COMMUNICATIONS.

FIRST AMENDMENT- RIGHT SPEECHES AS WELL AS LET'S SAY A WHISTLE BLOWERS AND- YOU KNOW THE PRESS SO AS FAR AS YOUR EXAMPLE I THINK IT WILL.

CHOOSING TO UTILIZE AND UNDERGO ASSISTED REPRODUCTIVE MEDICINE CAN BE COSTLY. VICTIMS OF FERTILITY FRAUD CAN BE HURT FINANCIALLY AS SOME PARENTS USE THEIR ENTIRE.

TODAY INDISCRIMINATE ESSENTIAL HERTZBERG TO NOTE THE ALACRITY WITH WHICH WE PROCEEDED TODAY. ALL RIGHTS- MEMORABLES. THANK YOU- THANK MISTER CHAIR AND THEN SENATORS I INTRODUCED AB EIGHT FIVE FIVE AT THE REQUEST OF THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL. IT WOULD ESTABLISH FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY. A BRANCH OF CALIFORNIA TO HONOR CALIFORNIA NATIVE AMERICAN DAY AS A PAID HOLIDAY. WITHOUT INCREASING THE NUMBER OF PAID COURT HOLIDAYS. THE STATE JUDICIAL COUNCIL PERSONNEL ARE COVERED UNDER A SEPARATE CODE SECTION FROM OTHER STATE WORKERS SECTION. ONE THREE FIVE OF THE CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE. CALIFORNIA NATIVE AMERICAN DAY IS ALREADY A STATE HOLIDAY IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT I LOBBIED THEN ASSEMBLYMEMBER JO BACHA TO INTRODUCE A B. NINETEEN FIFTY THREE. THAT WAS SIGNED INTO LAW BY GOVERNOR PETE WILSON. THAT DESIGNATION THE FOURTH FRIDAY OF SEPTEMBER AS NATIVE AMERICAN DAY WAS PUT FORWARD BUT ALSO WAS UNPAID HOLIDAY. FOR MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS I HAVE WORKED TOWARD CREATING A PAID STATE HOLIDAY TO RECOGNIZE AND LEARN ABOUT CALIFORNIA'S FIRST PEOPLE. LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE GREAT CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA LIKE THE MANY ROWS THAT WE TRAVEL WHERE ONCE INDIAN TRAILS. IN REDLANDS MY DISTRICT IN THE CITY OF REDLANDS BROUGHT WATER TO THAT COMMUNITY SO IT COULD FLOURISH THIS BILL STARTS TO SHOW APPRECIATION OF THESE CONTRIBUTIONS AND MANY MORE. I WANT TO THANK THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL FOR BRINGING THIS PROPOSAL FORWARD. YOU CALIFORNIANS KNOWS MUCH ABOUT THE STATE'S NATIVE AMERICAN HISTORY AND CULTURE DESPITE THE FACT THAT OUR STATE HAS MORE NATIVE AMERICANS LIVING IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAN ANY OTHER STATE IN THE NATION. THIS BILL WOULD BE THE FIRST STEP TOWARD CORRECTING THAT A MISSION OF CULTURAL SIGNIFICANCE. I ASK THIS COMMITTEE TO APPROVE AB EIGHT FIVE FIVE AND ALLOW THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL TO MAKE THIS CHANGE. THIS WOULD CREATE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR CALIFORNIANS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE HITORY OF CALIFORNIA'S FIRST PEOPLE. JOINING ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IS MONTEREY CITY COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT JUDGE AND CHAIR OF THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL LEGISLATION COMMITTEE THE HONORABLE JUDGE MARLOWE ANDERSON. THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER ROMMEL'S- JUDGE ANDERSON WELCOME IF YOU'RE ON THE PHONE THE FLOOR IS YOURS. AND GOOD AFTERNOON SHARE ON BURKE AS WELL AS THE MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE A FEW BRIEF COMMENTS REGARDING EIGHTY EIGHT FIFTY FIVE- THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL IS PLEASED TO SPONSOR EIGHTY EIGHT FIFTY FIVE WOULD YOU DESIGNATE NATIVE AMERICAN DAY AT THE JUDICIAL HOLIDAY. IN LIEU OF COLUMBUS DAY BY RECOGNIZING NATIVE AMERICAN DAY AS A JUDICIAL HOLIDAY EIGHTY EIGHT FIFTY FIVE FURTHERS THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL PERMISSION TO REMOVE BARRIERS TO ACCESS AND FAIRNESS. BY BEING RESPONSIVE TO THE STATE'S CULTURAL AND ETHNIC DIVERSITY. EIGHTY EIGHT FIFTY FIVE ALIGNS THE JUDICIAL BRANCH WITH. OTHER BRANCHES OF CALIFORNIA'S GOVERNMENT. IT IS A BRANCH. ARE SET IN. THE COURTS ARE THE ONLY PART OF STATE GOVERNMENT BUT STILL CLOSES ITS DOORS IN OBSERVANCE OF COLUMBUS DAY. COLUMBUS DAY WILL CONTINUE TO BE A STATE HOLIDAY BUT- LIKE OTHER STATE OFFICES WILL BE OPEN FOR BUSINESS. ON THE SECOND MONDAY IN OCTOBER. BY EXCHANGING NATIVE AMERICAN DAY FOR COLUMBUS DAY THE COURTS WILL MAINTAIN THE SAME NUMBER OF JUDICIAL HOLIDAYS. THIS ENSURES THAT SAME LEVEL OF ACCESS TO THE COURTS ALL WHILE ALSO RECOGNIZING THE IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTIONS OF NATIVE AMERICANS THE CALIFORNIA AND THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY.

PEOPLES JUST A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS IF I MAY BE THROUGH THE CHAIR POSE TO THE AUTHOR IF YOU'LL ACCEPT- THIS WOULD BE TAKING THE PAID PORTION OF ANOTHER HOLIDAY. TO ATTACH IT TO THE NATIVE AMERICAN- HOLIDAY. I WANT TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT THERE IS A HIGH HEALTHY AMOUNT OF RESPECT FOR THOSE THAT DO- HONOR AND RECOGNIZE OUR COLUMBUS DAY THAT THIS IS NO FAT IN NO WAY OR FASHION. WILL LIMIT COLUMBUSDAY FROM THE LIST OF HOLIDAYS IT'S JUST THE PAID COMPONENT THAT WILL BE GOING TO THE NATIVE AMERICAN DAY IS THAT CORRECT. YES THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION CENTER AND THAT IS CORRECT THIS IN THIS BILL IN NO WAY. WILL TAKE AWAY- COLUMBUS DAY AS A HOLIDAY. BUT WILL- EXCHANGE COLUMBUS DAY AS A PAID HOLIDAY IN EXCHANGE FOR A CALIFORNIA NATIVE AMERICAN DAY- THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL- DOES A. B. EIGHT FIVE FIVE SO I THINK IT BALANCES THAT APPROACH. CAN LAST QUESTION- WOULD BE THAT- THERE ARE ARE YOU AWARE OF- OF ANY DESIGNS TO. ELIMINATE COLUMBUS DAY. AS A RECOGNIZED HOLIDAY. EITHER NOW OR IN THE COMING- LEGISLATIVE CYCLE OR THEREAFTER. THANKS FOR THE QUESTION AGAIN SENATOR AND ON BEHALF OF MYSELF AS A FAMILY MEMBER THERE IS NO MOVEMENT ON BEHALF OF- ASSEMBLY MEMBER FROM THE FOURTEENTH DISTRICT MOVING FORWARD IN THAT FASHION R. WITH THAT BEING SAID- I LIKE IT MENTIONED. I'M GLAD TO SUPPORT THIS TODAY I DO BELIEVE THAT. WE DO NEED TO- PRESERVER HISTORY.

AND I WOULD SAY- WITH DUE RESPECT TO MY- MY COLLEAGUE FROM FRESNO- MEANWHILE THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER MAY NOT HAVE THOSE DESIGNS IN MIND I DO THINK MIGHT MY LEGISLATION STALLED OUT- LAST SESSION- ON ENDING COLUMBUS DAY- I DO THINK- REFERENCE FOR- REDIFF.
