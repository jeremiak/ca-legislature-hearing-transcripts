00:31:07.999 --> 00:31:10.835
CONCERN ABOUT THAT BECAUSE WE

00:31:12.370 --> 00:31:14.372
IN MY DISTRICT AND I THINK.

00:31:14.439 --> 00:31:15.707
BUT DISTRICTS ACROSS CALIFORNIA

00:31:15.773 --> 00:31:16.908
THAT PEOPLE ARE HAVING TO WAIT

00:31:16.975 --> 00:31:18.409
IN LONG LINES AT THE DMV.

00:31:18.476 --> 00:31:20.044
BECAUSE OF WHAT THE PROBLEMS THE

00:31:20.111 --> 00:31:22.647
REAL IDEA CAUSING AND AND THAT A

00:31:22.714 --> 00:31:24.415
LACK OF AVAILABLE AYE PERSONNEL

00:31:24.482 --> 00:31:26.451

WORKING ON THAT PROBLEM BUT IT

00:31:27.685 --> 00:31:29.387

HAVING TO GO TO THE DMV IS SO

00:31:38.463 --> 00:31:40.064
I'M JUST WONDERING WHY --

00:31:40.131 --> 00:31:42.300

00:40:23.454 --> 00:40:25.990
POINT IN TIME COUNTS OF VERY

00:40:26.056 --> 00:40:28.159

TERMS OF THE SP <u>&lt;c.green&gt; YOU IN&lt;/c&gt;</u>

00:59:10.213 --> 00:59:13.983
TERMS OF WHY WAS CREATED AND THE

00:59:14.050 --> 00:59:15.952
PROVISION THAT SAYS THAT --

00:59:16.019 --> 00:59:18.087
A SALES TAX CUT WOULD BE KICKING

00:59:18.154 --> 00:59:21.291
IN IF WE DID WE FEEL THAT.

00:59:21.357 --> 00:59:22.625
ALL DEFERRED MY COLLEAGUE ON THE

00:59:22.692 --> 00:59:24.594
HISTORY BUT THERE ARE CODE

00:59:24.661 --> 00:59:26.663
SECTIONS THAT ALLOW FOR EACH

00:59:26.729 --> 00:59:28.731
TRIGGER MECHANISM BASICALLY IF

00:59:28.798 --> 00:59:29.933
THE BALANCE OF THE FFT YOU

00:59:29.999 --> 00:59:31.601
REACHES A CERTAIN THRESHOLD.

00:59:31.668 --> 00:59:33.102
ON THAT WOULD GENERATE A SALES

00:59:33.169 --> 00:59:34.570
TAX A TEMPORARY SALES TAX

00:59:34.637 --> 00:59:38.274
DECREASE.

00:59:38.341 --> 00:59:39.008
THANK YOU CREDIT BECAUSE THE

OTHER DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE.

00:59:40.310 --> 00:59:41.811
AND I'M NOT SURE ON HOW MUCH OF

00:59:41.878 --> 00:59:43.146
THE HISTORY YOU'RE LOOKING FOR

00:59:43.212 --> 00:59:44.447
ON THE RESERVES BUT IN GENERAL

00:59:44.514 --> 00:59:48.685
THE THIS SFU IS MORE OF THE HAVE

00:59:48.751 --> 00:59:49.953
ACCESS.

00:59:50.019 --> 00:59:51.854
TO THAT LATER ON IN TWENTY

00:59:51.921 --> 00:59:52.422
FOURTEEN VOTERS APPROVED THE

00:59:53.623 --> 00:59:55.558
RESERVES.

00:59:55.625 --> 00:59:57.827
SO WHY WAS THAT WHY WAS THAT

00:59:57.894 --> 00:59:59.629
THAT THE SALES TAX CUT PROVISION

00:59:59.696 --> 01:00:00.897
INCLUDED WHAT WHAT WAS THE

01:00:00.964 --> 01:00:05.735
PURPOSE BEHIND IT.

01:00:05.802 --> 01:00:07.570
I KNOW IF I TELL YOU ON THAT.

01:00:07.637 --> 01:00:09.639
YOU TO GET BACK TOGETHER YES --

01:00:09.706 --> 01:00:11.741
SO JUST OF OF FROM A DRUM A

01:00:11.808 --> 01:00:12.875
GENERAL PUBLIC STAMP WHAT I I

01:00:12.942 --> 01:00:13.509
GUESS THAT WOULD BE THE REASON

01:00:13.576 --> 01:00:14.110
WHY I'M ASKING THIS I DON'T

01:00:14.177 --> 01:00:14.644
THINK THE GENERAL PUBLIC

01:00:14.711 --> 01:00:15.445
UNDERSTANDS THAT.

01:00:15.511 --> 01:00:17.613
IF WE DO HAVE ADDITIONAL SAVINGS

01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:19.449
THAT AS AS WE FILL THESE --

01:00:19.515 --> 01:00:21.651
SAVINGS ACCOUNTS THAT THERE IS A

01:00:21.718 --> 01:00:23.152
TRIGGER MECHANISM THAT ALLOWS

01:00:23.219 --> 01:00:25.021
FOR THE MONEY TO GO BACK --

01:00:25.088 --> 01:00:26.556
AND TO THE TO THE ECONOMY OR TO

01:00:26.622 --> 01:00:29.158
THE TO THE GENERAL POPULATION TO

01:00:29.225 --> 01:00:31.227
ASSAIL SEX REPRODUCTION IS THAT

01:00:31.294 --> 01:00:32.362
CORRECT.

01:00:32.428 --> 01:00:33.162
THAT'S CORRECT AND THE

01:00:33.229 --> 01:00:34.831
CONFERENCE BUDGET BEFORE YOU

01:00:34.897 --> 01:00:35.832
DOES NOT HAVE IT WOULD NOT

01:00:35.898 --> 01:00:37.533
TRIGGER THAT MECHANISM.

01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:39.569
AND IS THAT IT IN IS THAT

01:00:39.635 --> 01:00:40.436
BECAUSE WE CREATE A THIRD

01:00:40.503 --> 01:00:43.006
ACCOUNT.

01:00:43.072 --> 01:00:44.407
NO IT'S MORE BECAUSE OF THE

01:00:44.474 --> 01:00:46.309
EXPENDITURE PLAN.

01:00:46.376 --> 01:00:47.543
SO WHEN THAT WAS THERE A

01:00:47.610 --> 01:00:49.445
DISCUSSION THEN IN IN IN

01:00:49.512 --> 01:00:51.080
DETERMINING WHETHER TO CREATE

01:00:51.147 --> 01:00:52.515
ADDITIONAL COUNTS VERSUS JUST

01:00:52.582 --> 01:00:54.217
PUTTING ALL THE MONEY INTO.

01:00:54.283 --> 01:00:57.787
A EXISTING SAVINGS ACCOUNTS.

01:00:57.854 --> 01:00:59.922

01:01:18.408 --> 01:01:20.109
ON BUT THERE'S A COUPLE THINGS

01:01:20.176 --> 01:01:21.411
HAPPENING HERE NOT THE LEAST OF

01:01:21.477 --> 01:01:23.613
WHICH IS THAT THE EXPENDITURE

01:01:23.679 --> 01:01:25.281
AMOUNT WOULDN'T ALLOW FOR THAT

01:01:25.348 --> 01:01:26.783
SUGAR TO BE REACHED IN THE ASSET

01:01:26.849 --> 01:01:28.084
FEE YOU BASED ON SPENDING THAT'S

01:01:28.151 --> 01:01:30.153
INCLUDED.

01:01:30.219 --> 01:01:32.288
AND GUN JUST AND WHAT IS THE

01:01:32.355 --> 01:01:33.289
TRICK WHAT WHAT WHAT POINT WITH

01:01:33.356 --> 01:01:37.960
THE TRIGGER OCCUR.

01:01:38.027 --> 01:01:39.295
OTHER SO THERE'S TWO DIFFERENT

01:01:39.362 --> 01:01:41.531
TRIGGERS THE FIRST IS IF THE

01:01:41.597 --> 01:01:43.900
BALANCE REACHES GREATER THAN 4%

01:01:43.966 --> 01:01:45.968
OF GENERAL FUND REVENUES IN BOTH

01:01:46.035 --> 01:01:46.936
THE PRIOR YEAR AND THE CURRENT

01:01:47.003 --> 01:01:47.470
YEAR.

01:01:47.537 --> 01:01:48.871
SO THAT WOULD BE SEVENTEEN

01:01:48.938 --> 01:01:51.874
EIGHTEEN AND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN

01:01:51.941 --> 01:01:53.576
THEN THE SECOND TRIGGER IS IF

01:01:53.643 --> 01:01:55.278
THE BALANCE AND EIGHTEEN

01:01:55.344 --> 01:01:56.646
NINETEEN REACHES 3% OF GENERAL

01:01:56.712 --> 01:01:58.081
FUND REVENUES WHICH IS ABOUT

01:01:58.147 --> 01:01:59.949
FOUR POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS.

01:02:00.016 --> 01:02:01.117
AND ALSO THAT THE

01:02:01.184 --> 01:02:03.286
ADMINISTRATION'S OUT FORECAST

01:02:03.352 --> 01:02:04.754
FOR REVENUES INCREASES BETWEEN

01:02:04.821 --> 01:02:05.888
MAY THIRTIETH AND SEPTEMBER

01:02:05.955 --> 01:02:07.557
FIRST.

01:02:07.623 --> 01:02:08.691
I BELIEVE IT'S SEPTEMBER FIRST

01:02:08.758 --> 01:02:09.759
BUT IT'S MAY THIRTIETH AND

01:02:09.826 --> 01:02:11.928
ANOTHER POINT IN SEPTEMBER --

01:02:11.994 --> 01:02:14.197
IN IN THE CURRENT YEAR.

01:02:14.263 --> 01:02:16.332
SO BOTH OF THOSE TRIGGERS WOULD

01:02:16.399 --> 01:02:19.669
HAVE THE CAR* FOR TAT FOR

01:02:19.735 --> 01:02:20.703
THOSE BONUS FOR TWO AT THE MET.

01:02:20.770 --> 01:02:23.139
SO WITHIN EACH OF THOSE TRIGGERS

01:02:23.206 --> 01:02:24.173
BOTH CRITERIA HAVE TO BE MAD

01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:25.074
RIGHT SO BUT BUT EITHER ONE

01:02:25.141 --> 01:02:26.676
COULD BE TRIGGERED SO FEW IN THE

01:02:26.742 --> 01:02:29.612
FIRST CASE HIT 4% IN BOTH

01:02:29.679 --> 01:02:30.179
SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN EIGHTEEN

01:02:30.246 --> 01:02:30.746
NINETEEN AND THAT ONE WHAT

01:02:30.813 --> 01:02:31.013
HAPPENED.

01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:31.948
AND IN THE SECOND CASE IF YOU

01:02:32.014 --> 01:02:33.583
HAD THAT SITUATION WHERE THE

01:02:33.649 --> 01:02:35.718
FORECAST INCREASES AND ALSO YOU

01:02:35.785 --> 01:02:38.020
HIT 3% AND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN THE

01:02:38.087 --> 01:02:39.489
NOT TRIGGER WHAT. TO WHAT WHAT

01:02:39.555 --> 01:02:40.756
THE LEVEL BE FOR THE FIRST

01:02:40.823 --> 01:02:43.326
PRETTY I POLICY YOU IS THAT I

01:02:43.392 --> 01:02:43.860
DON'T WANT FOUR POINT ONE

01:02:43.926 --> 01:02:46.229
BILLION. FOR GOD THIS IT'S IT'S

01:02:46.295 --> 01:02:47.230
ROUGHLY FOUR POINT WAS TO THE

01:02:47.296 --> 01:02:48.197
FOUR POINT ONE MILLION IN

01:02:48.264 --> 01:02:49.265
EIGHTEEN NINETEEN IS.

01:02:49.332 --> 01:02:51.834
FOR THE SECOND TRIGGER THE 4%

01:02:51.901 --> 01:02:53.569
HIGHER IT'S IT'S ABOUT FIVE

01:02:53.636 --> 01:02:55.004
BILLION IN EACH YEAR ALTHOUGH I

01:02:55.071 --> 01:02:55.771
DON'T HAVE THAT NUMBER OFF THE

01:02:55.838 --> 01:02:57.306
TOP OF MY HEAD BUT THAT ONE IS A

01:02:57.373 --> 01:02:58.708
LOT HIGHER SO THE STATE IS NOT

01:02:58.774 --> 01:03:00.276
REALLY AT RISK OF HITTING ON ONE

01:03:00.343 --> 01:03:01.077
OF THE ONE THAT MIGHT.

01:03:01.144 --> 01:03:02.979
BE YOU KNOW CLOSER TO OF ISSUE

01:03:03.045 --> 01:03:04.547
IS -- IS THE

01:03:04.614 --> 01:03:06.082
SECOND TRIGGER WITH A 3%.

01:03:06.149 --> 01:03:07.884
AND JUST MY LAST QUESTION IS WAS

01:03:07.950 --> 01:03:10.286
THERE EVER DISCUSSION OF USING

01:03:10.353 --> 01:03:11.721
MORE MONEY ABUSING IS THAT MORE

01:03:11.787 --> 01:03:12.922
PUTTING MORE THE MONEY INTO THE

01:03:12.989 --> 01:03:15.024
EXISTING TWO ACCOUNTS --

01:03:15.091 --> 01:03:15.625
INSTEAD OF TREATING THE THIRD

01:03:15.691 --> 01:03:17.426
ACCOUNT.

01:03:17.493 --> 01:03:19.095
WE'VE REACH THE CONSTITUTIONAL

01:03:19.162 --> 01:03:20.730
TARGET AND THE PROP TO RESERVE

01:03:20.796 --> 01:03:22.632
AMOUNT CELL AND MORE AT THE

01:03:22.698 --> 01:03:24.934
HIGHEST THAT IT CAN GO SO WHAT

01:03:25.001 --> 01:03:25.535
HAPPENS IF YOU CONTINUE TO PUT

01:03:25.601 --> 01:03:26.802
IT.

01:03:26.869 --> 01:03:28.171
UP WELL ACTUALLY AND THERE'S

01:03:28.237 --> 01:03:29.672
ANOTHER ITEM THAT WILL GET TO

01:03:29.739 --> 01:03:31.107
UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF PROP TWO

01:03:31.174 --> 01:03:31.641
ONCE YOU REACH THE

01:03:31.707 --> 01:03:34.143
CONSTITUTIONAL TARGET OF 10%.

01:03:34.210 --> 01:03:35.444
ANYTHING ABOVE AND BEYOND THAT

01:03:35.511 --> 01:03:36.746
SPILLS OVER IT'S REQUIRED FOR

01:03:36.812 --> 01:03:37.880
INFRASTRUCTURE.

01:03:37.947 --> 01:03:39.715
SO IF WE HAD PUT MORE MONEY INTO

01:03:39.782 --> 01:03:41.517
THE PROP TWO ABOVE AND BEYOND

01:03:41.584 --> 01:03:41.918
THE MONEY WE COULD

01:03:41.984 --> 01:03:44.787
INFRASTRUCTURE.

01:03:44.854 --> 01:03:47.557
IT'S A LITTLE MORE COMPLICATED

01:03:47.623 --> 01:03:48.691
BUT IT'S EVIDENCE WHATSOEVER

01:03:48.758 --> 01:03:49.759
LET'S LET THE REQUIRED AMOUNT SO

01:03:49.825 --> 01:03:52.161
WE THE NEXT NEXT YEAR WHEN YOU.

01:03:52.228 --> 01:03:53.429
PUT ANOTHER WAY WHAT IT WOULD BE

01:03:53.496 --> 01:03:55.164
USED AFTER SESSION THE FOLLOWING

01:03:55.231 --> 01:03:56.766
YEAR CRACKS ABOUT IT IN IN NEXT

01:03:56.832 --> 01:03:58.034
YEAR'S BUDGET SINCE WE'RE

01:03:58.100 --> 01:03:58.401
PROPOSE THAT.

01:03:58.467 --> 01:03:59.435
SINCE WE BE AT 10% ANY

01:03:59.502 --> 01:04:01.237
ADDITIONAL REQUIRED CALCULATION

01:04:01.304 --> 01:04:05.208
FOR POP TO THE BALANCE YOU DON'T

01:04:05.274 --> 01:04:07.043
NEED 410% GOES TO INTEREST.

01:04:07.109 --> 01:04:08.377
OKAY SO SO I THINK WE'RE SAYING

01:04:08.444 --> 01:04:08.911
THE SAME THING IT DOES NOT

01:04:08.978 --> 01:04:09.979
INFRASTRUCTURE JUST DOESN'T GO

01:04:10.046 --> 01:04:11.514
THIS YEAR GOES NEXT YEAR GREAT

01:04:11.581 --> 01:04:13.883
THANK YOU.

01:04:13.950 --> 01:04:15.718
AND AND ALEJO DITTO IF YOU

01:04:15.785 --> 01:04:17.920
WANTED A OR COULD ANSWER MR

01:04:17.987 --> 01:04:19.055
FUNG'S FIRST QUESTION AROUND

01:04:19.121 --> 01:04:19.989
SOME OF THE HISTORY OF THE YES

01:04:20.056 --> 01:04:20.823
OF THE FIRST SALES TAX SUGAR WAS

01:04:20.890 --> 01:04:23.759
PASSED AS PART OF THE NINETEEN

01:04:23.826 --> 01:04:24.360
NINETY NINETY ONE ON BUDGET.

01:04:24.427 --> 01:04:28.264
AND THE SECOND ONE WAS PER THE

01:04:28.331 --> 01:04:28.864
TWO THOUSAND TWO THOUSAND ONE

01:04:28.931 --> 01:04:29.799
BUDGET -- IN

01:04:29.865 --> 01:04:32.101
THE NINETEEN NINETY NINETEEN

01:04:32.168 --> 01:04:33.269
NINETY ONE BUDGET --

01:04:33.336 --> 01:04:34.370
THE FIRST SET SALES TAX SUGAR

01:04:34.437 --> 01:04:36.172
WAS PASSED COUPLED WITH A SALES

01:04:36.239 --> 01:04:37.740
TAX INCREASE OF THE EQUIVALENT

01:04:37.807 --> 01:04:39.842
ONE QUARTER CENT ON AND THEN IN

01:04:39.909 --> 01:04:41.677
THE TWO THOUSAND TWO THOUSAND

01:04:41.744 --> 01:04:42.511
ONE SPENDING PLAN ON THE IDEA

01:04:42.578 --> 01:04:45.581
WAS TO REDUCE THE THRESHOLD 23%.

01:04:45.648 --> 01:04:46.649
JUST ONE LAST QUESTION HAS A

01:04:46.716 --> 01:04:47.817
TRIGGER EVER BEEN PULLED

01:04:47.883 --> 01:04:48.117
[inaudible]

01:04:48.184 --> 01:04:51.220
YES WHAT'S WHEN WAS THAT.

01:04:51.287 --> 01:04:54.090
WHO -- EARLY

01:04:54.156 --> 01:04:55.258
TO MID TWO THOUSANDS ITEM OF THE

01:04:55.324 --> 01:04:55.491
DAY OFF.

01:04:55.558 --> 01:04:56.125
PICKY [inaudible]

01:04:56.192 --> 01:04:57.760
THANK YOU [inaudible]

01:04:57.827 --> 01:05:00.429
MISTER BENNETT.

01:05:00.496 --> 01:05:02.365
SO OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE BEEN HAVING

01:05:02.431 --> 01:05:03.833
THIS DISCUSSION FOR A COUPLE OF

01:05:03.899 --> 01:05:05.034
WEEKS NOW BUT ANOTHER QUESTION

01:05:05.101 --> 01:05:06.102
JUST A STATEMENT.

01:05:06.168 --> 01:05:07.803
AS FAR AS I CAN TELL THE ONLY

01:05:07.870 --> 01:05:09.171
REASON.

01:05:09.238 --> 01:05:10.940
TO CREATE NEW TYPES OF BUDGET

01:05:11.007 --> 01:05:12.975
SAID DEFICIT SAVINGS ACCOUNTS IS

01:05:13.042 --> 01:05:14.243
TO AVOID.

01:05:14.310 --> 01:05:15.745
LOWERING THE STATE SALES TAX

01:05:15.811 --> 01:05:17.079
RATE AND GIVING THE PEOPLE

01:05:17.146 --> 01:05:18.214
CALIFORNIA BREAK ON THEIR STATE

01:05:18.281 --> 01:05:19.682
SALES TAX.

01:05:19.749 --> 01:05:21.050
AND I THINK THAT'S

01:05:21.117 --> 01:05:22.518
UNCONSCIONABLE IN AN ERA WHEN WE

01:05:22.585 --> 01:05:23.419
HAVE A NINE BILLION DOLLAR

01:05:23.486 --> 01:05:27.490
BUDGET SURPLUS.

01:05:27.556 --> 01:05:31.327
OTHER COMMENTS QUESTIONS.

01:05:31.394 --> 01:05:33.195
OKAY SEEING NONE I ANY MEMBERS

01:05:33.262 --> 01:05:35.564
PUBLIC IN SUPPORT OF S..

01:05:35.631 --> 01:05:39.368
BE.

01:05:39.435 --> 01:05:39.969
EIGHT SIX FOUR THEY WANNA POST

01:05:40.036 --> 01:05:42.305
DISPUTE.

01:05:42.371 --> 01:05:43.639
SIX ONE OKAY SINGLE MOVE BONTA

01:05:43.706 --> 01:05:46.108
SP IS SIX FIVE WHICH DEALS WITH

01:05:46.175 --> 01:05:47.610
PROPOSITION TWO ALREADY

01:05:47.677 --> 01:05:49.245
DIFFERENT.

01:05:49.312 --> 01:05:50.179
MISTER CHAIR THIS GETS TO

01:05:50.246 --> 01:05:51.647
ASSEMBLY MEMBER FONG SECONDARY

01:05:51.714 --> 01:05:53.182
QUESTION ON THE PROPOSITION TWO

01:05:53.249 --> 01:05:53.949
AND WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU REACH

01:05:54.016 --> 01:05:55.985
THE CONSTITUTIONAL ON THRESHOLD

01:05:56.052 --> 01:05:56.952
10%.

01:05:57.019 --> 01:05:58.254
THE BILL SPECIFIES HOW PROP TO

01:05:58.321 --> 01:05:59.488
INFRASTRUCTURE SPENDING WILL

01:05:59.555 --> 01:06:03.492
OCCUR FOR TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY

01:06:03.559 --> 01:06:06.028
TWENTY TWO AND 202-021-2120 TWO

01:06:06.095 --> 01:06:07.563
FISCAL YEARS OF THE NEXT THREE

01:06:07.630 --> 01:06:08.431
FISCAL YEARS.

01:06:08.497 --> 01:06:09.365
THE FIRST FOREIGN FIFTEEN

01:06:09.432 --> 01:06:11.100
MILLION LOSS AT GENERAL FUND

01:06:11.167 --> 01:06:12.868
INFRASTRUCTURE SPENDING --

01:06:12.935 --> 01:06:14.904
WITH AMOUNTS ABOVE THAT AND NOW

01:06:14.970 --> 01:06:16.772
EVENLY ALLOCATED TO AFFORDABLE

01:06:16.839 --> 01:06:18.374

SO I THINK WHEN THE VOTERS

01:06:29.418 --> 01:06:31.554
PASSED PROPERTY WILL AND WE TOLD

01:06:31.620 --> 01:06:32.088
THEM THAT WE WERE GOING TO

01:06:32.154 --> 01:06:34.623
INVEST.

01:06:34.690 --> 01:06:35.658
THOSE ARE FUNDS AN

01:06:35.725 --> 01:06:36.492
INFRASTRUCTURE THERE WERE%

01:06:36.559 --> 01:06:38.194
PROBABLY THINKING ABOUT ROADS

01:06:38.260 --> 01:06:40.730
AND BRIDGES AND AQUEDUCTS AND

01:06:40.796 --> 01:06:42.365
DAMS AND THINGS LIKE THAT I

01:06:42.431 --> 01:06:42.965
DON'T THINK THEY WERE TALKING

01:06:43.032 --> 01:06:43.366
ABOUT [inaudible]

01:06:43.432 --> 01:06:44.900
STATE.

01:06:44.967 --> 01:06:46.068
BUILDINGS AND THAT'S WHAT THE

01:06:46.135 --> 01:06:49.205
MAJORITY OF THE MONEY IN THIS

01:06:49.271 --> 01:06:50.573
TRAILER BILL IS GOING TO WHAT I

01:06:50.639 --> 01:06:51.741
WAS THE JUSTIFICATION FOR

01:06:51.807 --> 01:06:53.209
PUTTING THAT MONEY. TO WARD

01:06:53.275 --> 01:06:55.378
STATE BUILDINGS AND NOT TOWARDS

01:06:55.444 --> 01:06:55.578
WHAT.

01:06:55.644 --> 01:06:59.682
THEY A MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC

01:06:59.749 --> 01:07:02.318
MIGHT CONSIDER INFRASTRUCTURE.

01:07:02.385 --> 01:07:03.552
PROP TO SPECIFICALLY REFERENCES

01:07:03.619 --> 01:07:04.887
UP GOVERNMENT CODE SECTION ON

01:07:04.954 --> 01:07:07.022
INFRASTRUCTURE EONS WE BELIEVE

01:07:07.089 --> 01:07:08.758
THAT STATE BUILDINGS ARE

01:07:08.824 --> 01:07:10.826
PERFECTLY PERMISSIBLE UNDER THAT

01:07:10.893 --> 01:07:12.161
CODE SECTION.

01:07:12.228 --> 01:07:13.129
I AGREE WITH YOU THAT IT'S

01:07:13.195 --> 01:07:13.996
PERMITTED I JUST THOUGHT

01:07:14.063 --> 01:07:15.498
THINKING THAT THE AVERAGE VOTER
