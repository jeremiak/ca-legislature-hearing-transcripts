01:33:38.112 --> 01:33:38.746
NUMBER.

01:33:38.813 --> 01:33:40.214
ONE THAT WOULD BE ABOUT FORTY

01:33:40.281 --> 01:33:41.115
FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS I'M NOT

01:33:41.182 --> 01:33:42.483
SURE WE CAN GET THERE OVERNIGHT

01:33:42.550 --> 01:33:43.851
BUT WE SHOULD BE IN THE MIDDLE

01:33:43.918 --> 01:33:45.720
WE SHOULD BE TWENTY FIVE WE

01:33:45.786 --> 01:33:46.887
SHOULD BE THE TOP HALF WE LEAD

01:33:46.954 --> 01:33:47.855

PUBLIC SCHOOLS THE BASICS OF OUR

01:33:54.729 --> 01:33:55.529
STATE.

01:33:55.596 --> 01:33:56.530
SO TO GET THERE WHAT YOU COULD

01:33:56.597 --> 01:33:57.665
DO TWO THINGS YOU COULD INCREASE

01:33:57.732 --> 01:33:59.000
REVENUES OR YOU CAN RE

01:33:59.066 --> 01:34:01.202
PRIORITIZE OTHER STATE PROGRAMS

01:34:01.268 --> 01:34:03.304
REALLY ONLY TWO OPTIONS.

01:34:03.371 --> 01:34:04.538
SO TO GET TO THE MIDDLE.

01:34:04.605 --> 01:34:07.108
WOULD BE ROUGHLY TWENTY TO

01:34:07.174 --> 01:34:07.742
TWENTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS TO

01:34:07.808 --> 01:34:09.543
DO THAT WOULD HAVE TO SHUT DOWN

01:34:09.610 --> 01:34:12.613
THE UC CSU SYSTEM EVERY CHILD

01:34:12.680 --> 01:34:14.248
CARE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM.

01:34:14.315 --> 01:34:16.350
OUR STATE PRISON SYSTEM AND

01:34:16.417 --> 01:34:17.618
EVERY STATE PARK.

01:34:17.685 --> 01:34:18.986
WE'RE NOT GONNA DO THAT.

01:34:19.053 --> 01:34:20.554
THERE IS NO FREE LUNCH HERE SO

01:34:20.621 --> 01:34:22.023
REALLY IT'S ABOUT US GOING TO

01:34:22.089 --> 01:34:23.190
THE VOTERSOF CALIFORNIANS

01:34:23.257 --> 01:34:24.992
SAYING ARE YOU OKAY BEING FORTY

01:34:25.059 --> 01:34:26.127
FIRST.

01:34:26.193 --> 01:34:27.628
IS IF YOU'RE NOT THERE REALLY

01:34:27.695 --> 01:34:29.330
ARE LIMITED OPTIONS AND SO WE

01:34:29.397 --> 01:34:30.798
NEED TO MAKE SURE WE FIND OUR

01:34:30.865 --> 01:34:32.633
FUTURE THAT'S OUR SCHOOLS IN

01:34:32.700 --> 01:34:33.367
THIS DOES IT IT'S NOT.

01:34:33.434 --> 01:34:34.769
IT'S NOT ALWAYS ABOUT JUST MONEY

01:34:34.835 --> 01:34:36.203
AS A MONEY PER SE BUT THIS IN

01:34:36.270 --> 01:34:38.906
THIS IMPACTS SCHOOL CLASS SIZE.

01:34:38.973 --> 01:34:39.974
MAKE SURE WE CAN PAY OUR

01:34:40.041 --> 01:34:40.941
TEACHERS LIVING WAGES SO THEY

01:34:41.008 --> 01:34:42.476
CAN LIVE IN NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE

01:34:42.543 --> 01:34:43.577
THEY WORK.

01:34:43.644 --> 01:34:45.046
MAKING SURE WE CAN HAVE THESE

01:34:45.112 --> 01:34:47.281
ENRICHMENT PROGRAMS LIKE ARTS

01:34:47.348 --> 01:34:49.183
AND MATH IN SPORTS AND

01:34:49.250 --> 01:34:51.152
COUNSELORS IN SCHOOL NURSES AND

01:34:51.218 --> 01:34:52.386
THE BASICS IN OUR CLASSROOMS

01:34:52.453 --> 01:34:53.888
WHICH YOU DON'T HAVE TODAY.

01:34:53.954 --> 01:34:55.956
SO THIS SETS A FRAMEWORK TO GET

01:34:56.023 --> 01:34:57.691
WHERE WE NEED TO GO WE ALSO

01:34:57.758 --> 01:34:59.560
CAN'T FORGET IT'S ABOUT FUNDING

01:34:59.627 --> 01:35:00.828
THIS AS WELL AND SO WE LOOK

01:35:00.895 --> 01:35:03.631
FORWARD TO DISCUSSION ON AN

01:35:03.697 --> 01:35:05.733

01:35:15.476 --> 01:35:16.944
TO A RECENT STUDY.

01:35:17.011 --> 01:35:18.479
CALIFORNIA HAS THE FOURTEENTH

01:35:18.546 --> 01:35:20.448
WORST K. TWELVE SCHOOL SYSTEM IN

01:35:20.514 --> 01:35:22.283

THAT IS UNACCEPTABLE.

01:35:37.865 --> 01:35:39.400
I THINK IT'S NOT AN EXAGGERATION

01:35:39.467 --> 01:35:40.734
TO SAY THAT WE ARE FAILING THE

01:35:40.801 --> 01:35:42.069

DOWN.

01:35:44.238 --> 01:35:45.873
TO THE ROOT CAUSE OF THAT IS

01:35:45.940 --> 01:35:47.675

BUT THESE LAWS ARE COMPLETELY

01:40:56.450 --> 01:40:57.584

01:41:42.396 --> 01:41:43.430
BUT BECAUSE THEY HAVE LEVERAGE

01:42:05.486 --> 01:42:06.787

01:42:20.701 --> 01:42:22.369
IT DOESN'T PROHIBIT EMPLOYERS

01:42:22.436 --> 01:42:24.204
FROM USING ARBITRATION OR

DURING THE GREAT DEPRESSION

03:54:40.633 --> 03:54:42.101
BECAUSE WE REALIZE WHEN PEOPLE

03:54:42.168 --> 03:54:43.402
ARE OUT OF WORK ESPECIALLY WHEN

03:54:43.469 --> 03:54:44.737
THERE'S A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE

03:54:44.804 --> 03:54:45.504

LIVELIHOOD BUT THE LIVELIHOOD OF

03:54:48.874 --> 03:54:50.676
SMALL BUSINESSES IN A COMMUNITY

03:54:50.743 --> 03:54:52.211

03:54:55.314 --> 03:54:56.315
PEOPLE ARE UNEMPLOYED AND THEY

03:54:56.382 --> 03:54:57.850
HAVE NO UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE

03:54:57.917 --> 03:54:59.118
IT COULD CAUSE HOPE HOMELESSNESS

03:54:59.185 --> 03:55:00.386
PEOPLE?

03:55:00.453 --> 03:55:02.021
RUIN THEIR CREDIT AND YET IN

03:55:02.087 --> 03:55:03.656

03:55:03.722 --> 03:55:05.024
AROUND UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE

WHEN IT COMES TO LABOR DISPUTES

03:55:08.127 --> 03:55:09.762
THAT AREN'T ALWAYS CLEAR.

03:55:09.829 --> 03:55:11.297
I WE SOMETIMES IF YOU'RE LOCKED

03:55:11.363 --> 03:55:12.031
OUT AS AN EMPLOYEE YOU GET.

03:55:12.097 --> 03:55:14.366
UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE SOMETIMES

STRIKING WORKERS HAVE NOT HAD

03:55:18.137 --> 03:55:19.271
UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE.

03:55:19.338 --> 03:55:20.639
WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH THIS BILL

03:55:20.706 --> 03:55:21.807
IS TRYING TO LEVEL THE PLAYING

03:55:21.874 --> 03:55:23.843
FIELD INSANE IF YOU'RE LOCKED

03:55:23.909 --> 03:55:24.510
OUT FROM YOUR EMPLOYER THAT YOU

03:55:24.577 --> 03:55:25.644
CAN GET AN EMPLOYMENT INSURANCE

03:55:25.711 --> 03:55:27.012
AFTER ONE WEEK?

03:55:27.079 --> 03:55:28.147
IF YOU'RE ON STRIKE WITH YOUR

03:55:28.214 --> 03:55:29.882

FOUR WEEKS.

03:55:32.418 --> 03:55:33.786
MEMBERS I'D ASK YOU TO THINK

03:55:33.853 --> 03:55:35.754
WHAT IT BE LIKE TO BE ON STRIKE

03:55:35.821 --> 03:55:37.056
FOR FOUR WEEKS THIS IS NOT

03:55:37.122 --> 03:55:38.424
SOMETHING THAT WORKERS DO.

03:55:38.491 --> 03:55:40.192
EASILY IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT

03:55:40.259 --> 03:55:41.560
THEY WANT TO DEAL IN THERE'S NO

03:55:41.627 --> 03:55:43.896
INCENTIVE FOR A REDUCED PAYMENT

03:55:43.963 --> 03:55:45.331
TO STAY OUT ON STRIKE OVER FOUR

03:55:45.397 --> 03:55:47.633
WEEKS IT'S VERY RARE THAT WE

03:55:47.700 --> 03:55:49.568
HAVE THESE KINDS OF STRIKES IN

03:55:49.635 --> 03:55:50.503
CALIFORNIA.

03:55:50.569 --> 03:55:51.937
BUT ONCE IN AWHILE WE DO.

03:55:52.004 --> 03:55:54.640
AND WHEN WE DO MASS DEVASTATION

03:55:54.707 --> 03:55:56.275
HAPPENS TO THOSE FAMILIES AND TO

03:55:56.342 --> 03:55:58.477
THOSE COMMUNITIES.

03:55:58.544 --> 03:56:00.279
THIS IS A VERY BAD I THINK

03:56:00.346 --> 03:56:01.714
COMPROMISED BILL I WORKED HARD

03:56:01.780 --> 03:56:02.848
WITH THE CHAIR OF INSURANCE TO

MAKE SURE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT

03:56:04.216 --> 03:56:05.451
WE COULD PUT BRING FORWARD.

03:56:05.518 --> 03:56:06.719
BUT THIS HELPS TO LEVEL THE

03:56:06.785 --> 03:56:08.287
PLAYING FIELD AND IF YOUR

03:56:08.354 --> 03:56:09.588
BIGGEST CONCERN IS THAT LARGE

03:56:09.655 --> 03:56:11.423
CORPORATIONS DON'T HAVE ENOUGH

03:56:11.490 --> 03:56:14.760
POWER AND LEVERAGE DURING LABOR

03:56:14.827 --> 03:56:15.895
WORKERS.

03:56:15.961 --> 03:56:18.297
HAVE TOO MUCH INCENTIVE.

03:56:18.364 --> 03:56:20.199
IN A LABOR DISPUTE TO STAY ON

03:56:20.266 --> 03:56:21.567
STRIKE THEN DON'T WORK.

04:18:29.493 --> 04:18:31.195
STUDENTS AND WE NEED TO TAKE

04:18:31.262 --> 04:18:32.096
ACTION.

04:18:32.163 --> 04:18:33.698
IT IS THE DUTY OF THIS

04:18:33.764 --> 04:18:35.666
LEGISLATURE TO TAKE ACTION.

04:18:35.733 --> 04:18:37.368
CURRENT LAW ALLOWS THOSE SEEKING

04:18:37.435 --> 04:18:39.570
TO OPEN A CHARTER SCHOOL TO GO

04:18:39.637 --> 04:18:40.905
AUTHORIZES.

04:18:40.972 --> 04:18:43.007
SIMPLY PUT THIS MEANS THAT AFTER

04:18:43.074 --> 04:18:44.675
BEING REJECTED BY ONE BOARD.

04:18:44.742 --> 04:18:45.743
THEY CAN GO SEARCHING FOR

04:18:45.810 --> 04:18:47.612
ANOTHER BOARD FOR FOR APPROVAL

04:18:47.678 --> 04:18:50.581
OFTEN FAR FROM HOME.

04:18:50.648 --> 04:18:52.750
THIS CAN RESULT IN OVERSIGHT BY

04:18:52.817 --> 04:18:54.118
A BODY THAT IS HUNDREDS OF MILES

04:18:54.185 --> 04:18:55.753
AWAY.

04:18:55.820 --> 04:18:57.288
A LACK OF LOCAL OVERSIGHT CAN

04:18:57.355 --> 04:18:59.056
LEAD TO POOR FISCAL MANAGEMENT

04:18:59.123 --> 04:19:00.391
AND CERTAINLY.

04:19:00.458 --> 04:19:02.326
POOR STUDENT OUTCOMES.

04:19:02.393 --> 04:19:04.395
THIS BILL SEEKS TO ALLOW SCHOOL

04:19:04.462 --> 04:19:05.796
DISTRICTS TO CONSIDER FISCAL

04:19:05.863 --> 04:19:07.598
ACADEMIC OR FACILITY IMPACT THAT

04:19:07.665 --> 04:19:10.167
A NEW CHARTER SCHOOL MAY HAVE.

04:19:10.234 --> 04:19:11.402
ON A NEIGHBORHOOD PUBLIC SCHOOL

04:19:11.469 --> 04:19:13.170
THAT'S A NEW CHARTER SCHOOL

04:19:13.237 --> 04:19:14.305
THAT'S NOT A RE AUTHORIZED

04:19:14.372 --> 04:19:16.173
CHARTER SCHOOL THAT'S NOT WHEN

04:19:16.240 --> 04:19:17.675
IT'S EVEN EXISTENCE TODAY.

04:19:17.742 --> 04:19:18.976
DISTRICTS WILL NOT BE ABLE TO

04:19:19.043 --> 04:19:20.878
CONSIDER FISCAL IMPACT FOR

04:19:20.945 --> 04:19:22.513
EXISTING CHARTER SCHOOLS THAT

04:19:22.580 --> 04:19:23.614
WILL NOT.

04:19:23.681 --> 04:19:24.615
BE PART OF THE RE AUTHORIZATION

04:19:24.682 --> 04:19:26.150
PRESENT PROCESS.

04:19:26.217 --> 04:19:27.585
ONCE THE CHARTER COMES BACK FOR

04:19:27.652 --> 04:19:29.487
RENEWAL AUTHORIZES WILL CONSIDER

04:19:29.553 --> 04:19:31.555
THE FINANCIAL STABILITY OF THE

04:19:31.622 --> 04:19:33.658
CHARTER SCHOOL ITSELF.

04:19:33.724 --> 04:19:34.592
THIS WILL ALLOW THE AUTHORIZED

04:19:34.659 --> 04:19:36.394
OR TO IDENTIFY AND RESPOND TO A

04:19:36.460 --> 04:19:38.529
PROBLEM BEFORE IT BECOMES AN

04:19:38.596 --> 04:19:42.400
EMERGENCY. FOR EXAMPLE ONE

04:19:42.466 --> 04:19:43.668
SCHOOL WAS DENIED BY BOTH THE

04:19:43.734 --> 04:19:45.503
DISTRICT AND THE COUNTY AND WAS

04:19:45.569 --> 04:19:46.671
APPROVED BY THE STATE.

04:19:46.737 --> 04:19:47.939
BUT CLOSED DUE TO FISCAL

04:19:48.005 --> 04:19:49.373
MANAGEMENT.

04:19:49.440 --> 04:19:50.675
PARENTS WERE NOTIFIED THAT THE

04:19:50.741 --> 04:19:51.943
SCHOOL WAS CLOSING IN THE MIDDLE

04:19:52.009 --> 04:19:54.378
OF THE SCHOOL YEAR.

04:19:54.445 --> 04:19:55.479
THIS SCHOOL CLOSURE LESS

04:19:55.546 --> 04:19:57.581
STUDENTS STRANDED AND UNDER THIS

04:19:57.648 --> 04:19:58.282
BILL THIS COULD HAVE BEEN

04:19:58.349 --> 04:19:59.283
AVOIDED.

04:19:59.350 --> 04:20:00.551
THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN WARNINGS.

04:20:00.618 --> 04:20:02.520
ADDITIONALLY THIS BILL REQUIRES

04:20:02.586 --> 04:20:04.422
ALL TEACHERS IN CHARTER SCHOOLS

04:20:04.488 --> 04:20:06.791
TO HOLD REQUIRED CREDENTIAL. FOR

04:20:06.857 --> 04:20:09.593
THEIR TEACHING ASSIGNMENT.

04:20:09.660 --> 04:20:11.562
FINALLY THE BILL ALLOWS CHARTER

04:20:11.629 --> 04:20:14.098
STREE SO TO RECEIVE HELP WHEN

04:20:14.165 --> 04:20:15.733
THEY'E STRUGGLING ACADEMICALLY.

04:20:15.800 --> 04:20:17.468
AND ONCE AGAIN THIS BILL WILL

04:20:17.535 --> 04:20:19.370
NOT CLOSE CHARTER SCHOOLS.

04:20:19.437 --> 04:20:20.571
AND I SHOULD NOTE THAT WHEN THE

04:20:20.638 --> 04:20:21.906
SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC

04:20:21.973 --> 04:20:23.407
INSTRUCTION STATS WORK IS

04:20:23.474 --> 04:20:25.142
COMPLETE WE WILL CONTINUE THE

04:20:25.209 --> 04:20:26.477
ROBUST DISCUSSION WITH ALL

04:20:26.544 --> 04:20:27.411

04:20:27.478 --> 04:20:29.647
AND I WANT TO STRESS ALL PARTIES

04:20:29.714 --> 04:20:31.415

04:20:39.957 --> 04:20:41.092
SHOULD.

04:20:41.158 --> 04:20:42.193
CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE PUBLIC

04:20:42.259 --> 04:20:43.728
SCHOOLS AND MUST BE HELD

04:20:43.794 --> 04:20:44.729
ACCOUNTABLE TO PROTECT ALL

04:20:44.795 --> 04:20:49.867
STUDENTS I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE.

YOU KNOW I'M I'M REALLY TORN

04:20:59.777 --> 04:21:04.448
WITH THIS BILL BECAUSE I'VE

04:21:04.515 --> 04:21:06.150
ALWAYS BEEN A BIG SUPPORTER OF

04:21:06.217 --> 04:21:08.285
OUR TRADITIONAL PUBLIC SCHOOLS

04:21:08.352 --> 04:21:08.586
[inaudible]

04:21:08.652 --> 04:21:12.523
AND I I AM VERY CONCERNED ABOUT

04:21:12.590 --> 04:21:15.760
HOW THE CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE

04:21:15.826 --> 04:21:16.060
[inaudible]

04:21:16.127 --> 04:21:17.962
CREATING FINANCIAL FISCAL

04:21:18.029 --> 04:21:20.398
CHALLENGES FOR DISTRICTS.

04:21:20.464 --> 04:21:21.232
MANY OF OUR LARGE URBAN

04:21:21.298 --> 04:21:23.901
DISTRICTS.

04:21:23.968 --> 04:21:28.039
I ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE I I I I

04:21:28.105 --> 04:21:31.509
WANT TO SUPPORT ANY MEASURE THAT.

04:21:31.575 --> 04:21:33.144
WILL CRACK DOWN ON BAD CHARTER

04:21:33.210 --> 04:21:34.412
SCHOOLS BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT

04:21:34.478 --> 04:21:35.846
THERE ARE TOO MANY BAD CHARTER

04:21:35.913 --> 04:21:37.548
SCHOOLS OUT THERE.

04:21:37.615 --> 04:21:38.749
AND THAT WE SHOULD SHUT THEM

04:21:38.816 --> 04:21:40.584
DOWN [inaudible]

04:21:40.651 --> 04:21:43.120
MY CONCERN.

04:21:43.187 --> 04:21:46.023
IS THAT THIS BILL MAY RISK

04:21:46.090 --> 04:21:47.391
SHUTTING DOWN [inaudible]

04:21:47.458 --> 04:21:49.326
GOOD.

04:21:49.393 --> 04:21:51.162
EXISTING CHARTER SCHOOLS AND I

04:21:51.228 --> 04:21:51.729
ALTHOUGH.

04:21:51.796 --> 04:21:53.564
THE AUTHOR [inaudible]

04:21:53.631 --> 04:21:55.366
STATED THAT.

04:21:55.433 --> 04:21:58.469
THIS WILL NOT.

04:21:58.536 --> 04:22:01.972
YOU KNOW I WENT OVER A SPECIFIC

04:22:02.039 --> 04:22:04.575
PROVISION AND THE BILL.

GOVERNING AUTHORITY TO THE

04:22:20.157 --> 04:22:21.792
COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION TO BE

04:22:21.859 --> 04:22:23.360
LIMITED ONLY TO PROCEDURAL

04:22:23.427 --> 04:22:24.862
VIOLATIONS.

04:22:24.929 --> 04:22:27.498
SO IN OTHER WORDS.

04:22:27.565 --> 04:22:29.667
IF A GOOD CHARTER SCHOOL.

04:22:29.733 --> 04:22:32.436

THAT MAY BE ON SPECIFIED.

04:22:44.482 --> 04:22:45.950
THEY WOULD HAVE NO RIGHT TO AN

04:22:46.016 --> 04:22:47.084
APPEAL.

04:22:47.151 --> 04:22:48.786
IF IT WAS NOT FOR ANYTHING OTHER

04:22:48.853 --> 04:22:51.355
THAN A PROCEDURAL VIOLATION

04:22:51.422 --> 04:22:53.390
THAT'S THE FIGHT IN THE BILL

LARGELY BEEN UNTOUCHED SINCE IT

WAS ENACTED IN NINETEEN NINETY

04:25:12.663 --> 04:25:14.031
TWO AND IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE.

04:25:14.098 --> 04:25:15.866

YEARS AGO THAT WE GOT IT EXACTLY

RIGHT IT IS CERTAINLY

04:25:18.936 --> 04:25:21.071
APPROPRIATE. TO REVIEW.

04:32:39.443 --> 04:32:40.877
I CANNOT.

04:32:40.944 --> 04:32:42.646
IN GOOD CONSCIOUS.

04:32:42.713 --> 04:32:45.015
IN BEING A RESPONSIBLE MEMBER OF

04:32:45.082 --> 04:32:46.583
THIS BODY.

04:32:46.650 --> 04:32:48.985
CONTINUED TO POLITICIZE

04:32:49.052 --> 04:32:49.286
[inaudible]

04:32:49.352 --> 04:32:52.255
EDUCATION. FOR KIDS LIKE ME

04:32:52.322 --> 04:32:54.291
ACROSS THE STATE.

04:32:54.357 --> 04:32:54.991
IT.

04:32:55.058 --> 04:32:57.327
HURTS MY HEART.

04:32:57.394 --> 04:32:59.096
THERE WE PICKED PARENTS AGAINST

04:32:59.162 --> 04:33:00.564
EACH OTHER I HAVE PARENTS IN MY

04:33:00.630 --> 04:33:01.565
DISTRICT.

04:33:01.631 --> 04:33:02.966
THAT SEND THEIR KIDS TO

04:33:03.033 --> 04:33:04.234
TRADITIONAL SCHOOLS.

04:33:04.301 --> 04:33:06.737
CHARTER SCHOOLS AND PAROCHIAL

04:33:06.803 --> 04:33:09.139
SCHOOLS CHOICE HAS ALWAYS BEEN.

04:33:09.206 --> 04:33:11.908
AN A THING THAT PEOPLE CAN HAVE

04:33:11.975 --> 04:33:14.177
IF THEY COULD AFFORD IT.

04:33:14.244 --> 04:33:15.512
MY PARENTS WANTED TO SEND MY

04:33:15.579 --> 04:33:17.214
SISTERS AND I TO A PAROCHIAL

04:33:17.280 --> 04:33:18.515
SCHOOL BECAUSE THEY KNEW.

04:33:18.582 --> 04:33:19.816
OUR TRADITIONAL SCHOOLS IN OUR

04:33:19.883 --> 04:33:22.753
COMMUNITY FOR FAILING KIDS THEY

04:33:22.819 --> 04:33:24.921
JUST COULDN'T AFFORD IT.

04:33:24.988 --> 04:33:27.190
AND I WAS LUCKY THAT I HAD A MOM

04:33:27.257 --> 04:33:29.559
THAT FIGURED OUT HOW TO WORK THE

04:33:29.626 --> 04:33:31.061
MAGNET PROGRAM.

04:33:31.128 --> 04:33:32.262
AND SHE FIGURED IT OUT FOR ME IN

04:33:32.329 --> 04:33:34.631
MY YOUNGER SISTERS.

04:33:34.698 --> 04:33:36.566
THAT'S NOT THE CASE FOR EVERYONE.

04:33:36.633 --> 04:33:38.835
AND IT'S CERTAINLY NOT THE CASE.

04:33:38.902 --> 04:33:40.704
FOR NEW IMMIGRANT AMERICANS WHO

04:33:40.771 --> 04:33:42.072
ARE LEARNING THE SYSTEM FOR THE

04:33:42.139 --> 04:33:44.007
FIRST TIME.

04:33:44.074 --> 04:33:46.409
AND I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND.

04:33:46.476 --> 04:33:48.178
WHY WE CONTINUE TO POLITICIZE

04:33:48.245 --> 04:33:50.113
EDUCATION WHEN THE ISSUE REALLY

04:33:50.180 --> 04:33:52.349
IS ABOUT FUNDING?

04:33:52.415 --> 04:33:54.584
THE REAL ISSUE IS A WHY HAVE WE

04:33:54.651 --> 04:33:56.153
NOT PRIORITIZE.

04:33:56.219 --> 04:33:57.754
PUBLIC EDUCATION IN THE STATE OF

04:33:57.821 --> 04:33:59.289
CALIFORNIA IS IT BECAUSE KIDS

04:33:59.356 --> 04:34:01.658
LOOK MORE LIKE ME.

04:34:01.725 --> 04:34:03.326
BECAUSE THERE IMMIGRANT ENGLISH

04:34:03.393 --> 04:34:05.529
LANGUAGE LEARNERS BLACK OR BROWN

04:34:05.595 --> 04:34:07.364
KIDS ACROSS THE STATE.

04:34:07.430 --> 04:34:09.566
I LOOK AT THE NUMBERS.

04:34:09.633 --> 04:34:11.768
AND THE NUMBERS DO NOT LIE.

04:34:11.835 --> 04:34:14.271
AND I WANT TO GET US TO A PLACE.

04:34:14.337 --> 04:34:16.072
WHAT WE THOUGHT HAVING THIS

04:34:16.139 --> 04:34:18.408
POLITICAL FIGHT THIRTY SECOND

04:34:18.475 --> 04:34:19.810
AND HAVE THE FIGHT THAT WE NEED

04:34:19.876 --> 04:34:21.511
TO HAVE WHICH IS ABOUT FUNDING

04:34:21.578 --> 04:34:24.815
OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS?

04:34:24.881 --> 04:34:26.283
I CANNOT IN GOOD CONSCIOUS.

04:34:26.349 --> 04:34:28.151
SUPPORT ANY ADDITIONAL PIECE OF

04:34:28.218 --> 04:34:30.654
LEGISLATION.

04:34:30.720 --> 04:34:31.254
THE PITS PARENTS AGAINST EACH

04:34:31.321 --> 04:34:32.889
OTHER.

04:34:32.956 --> 04:34:34.491
IN KIDS AGAINST A SYSTEM.

04:34:34.558 --> 04:34:37.527
THAT HAS FOR DECADES

04:34:37.594 --> 04:34:37.828
[inaudible]

04:34:37.894 --> 04:34:38.595
NOT SERVICE [inaudible]

04:34:38.662 --> 04:34:41.598
THANK YOU.

04:34:41.665 --> 04:34:42.866
THANK YOU IS CARILLO.

04:34:42.933 --> 04:34:44.835
THERE'S NO APPLAUSE DURING

04:34:44.901 --> 04:34:47.504
DEBATE MEMBERS MISTER SMITH.

04:34:47.571 --> 04:34:48.905
YOU ARE RECOGNIZED.

04:34:48.972 --> 04:34:50.340
THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER.

04:34:50.407 --> 04:34:51.741
COLLEAGUES I RISE TODAY AS

04:34:51.808 --> 04:34:53.710
SOMEONE WHO HAS SPENT MY ENTIRE

04:34:53.777 --> 04:34:54.845
CAREER.

04:34:54.911 --> 04:34:57.480
IN THE EFFORTS TO SUPPORT.

04:34:57.547 --> 04:35:00.083
AND IMPROVE PUBLIC EDUCATION

04:35:00.150 --> 04:35:02.419
MUCH TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM LOS

04:35:02.485 --> 04:35:03.887
ANGELES CONCERNS.

04:35:03.954 --> 04:35:05.655
I HAVE HEARD THE CONCERNS OF

04:35:05.722 --> 04:35:07.457
EVERYONE IN THIS BODY WHOSE

04:35:07.524 --> 04:35:09.826
COMMUNITY CONTAINS FAMILIES WHO

04:35:09.893 --> 04:35:11.928
WANT A BETTER OPTION.

04:35:11.995 --> 04:35:14.197
WHO WANT CHOICE WHO WANT TO BE

04:35:14.264 --> 04:35:16.566
AWAY FROM WHAT THEY PERCEIVE AND

04:35:16.633 --> 04:35:18.401
SOMETIMES RIGHTFULLY SO? TO BE A

04:35:18.468 --> 04:35:19.903
FAILING.

04:35:19.970 --> 04:35:22.439
LOOK SCHOOL SYSTEM.

04:35:22.505 --> 04:35:25.609
IT IS UNAVOIDABLE IN THIS MOMENT.

04:35:25.675 --> 04:35:26.843
THAT WE ARE POLITICIZING.

04:35:26.910 --> 04:35:28.745
THIS ISSUE.

04:35:28.812 --> 04:35:30.580
BECAUSE WE ARE AT A POINT WHERE

04:35:30.647 --> 04:35:32.249
WE HAVE TO MAKE CRITICAL

04:35:32.315 --> 04:35:33.583
DECISIONS.

04:35:33.650 --> 04:35:34.885
GIVEN THE FACT THAT WE DON'T

04:35:34.951 --> 04:35:37.354
HAVE A NEW FUNDING STREAM TO

04:35:37.420 --> 04:35:39.522
INCREASE OUR LOCAL CONTROL BASS

04:35:39.589 --> 04:35:41.191
GRANT NOR THE SUPPLEMENTAL

04:35:41.258 --> 04:35:42.559
GRANTS.

04:35:42.626 --> 04:35:44.194
THAT SPECIAL EDUCATION

04:35:44.261 --> 04:35:46.162
INCREASINGLY CHALLENGES EVERY

04:35:46.229 --> 04:35:47.764
SCHOOL DISTRICT IN THE STATE TO

04:35:47.831 --> 04:35:49.933
DO MORE WITH LESS AND VERY OFTEN

04:35:50.000 --> 04:35:52.602
CHARTERS ARE NOT SERVING THOSE

04:35:52.669 --> 04:35:55.605
STUDENTS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS. TO

04:35:55.672 --> 04:35:58.241
THE POINT WE ARE NOW.

04:35:58.308 --> 04:35:59.509
WHERE IF WE DON'T MAKE THESE

04:35:59.576 --> 04:36:02.078
CRITICAL DECISIONS IF WE DO NOT

04:36:02.145 --> 04:36:04.547
ALLOW LOCALLY ELECTED SCHOOL

04:36:04.614 --> 04:36:06.816
BOARDS? TO MAKE THESE DECISIONS

04:36:06.883 --> 04:36:08.652
AND WE SAY WE KNOW BETTER HERE

04:36:08.718 --> 04:36:10.554
IN SACRAMENTO.

04:36:10.620 --> 04:36:12.489
THEN WE ALSO DO NEED TO BE

04:36:12.555 --> 04:36:14.925
WILLING TO STEP WHAT UP WITH THE

04:36:14.991 --> 04:36:17.460
FUNDING. TO IMPROVE EVERY SINGLE

04:36:17.527 --> 04:36:19.796
PUBLIC SCHOOL.

04:36:19.863 --> 04:36:21.364
BUT WHAT THIS MEASURE SPEAKS TO

04:36:21.431 --> 04:36:23.333
RIGHT NOW IS ALLOWING US TO TAKE

04:36:23.400 --> 04:36:26.369
A PAUSE. TO HAVE A VEHICLE TO

04:36:26.436 --> 04:36:28.171
SEND OVER TO THE SENATE WHILE WE

04:36:28.238 --> 04:36:29.940
WAIT FOR THE RECOMMENDATIONS

04:36:30.006 --> 04:36:32.309
FROM A TASK FORCE. TO SET US ON

04:36:32.375 --> 04:36:34.878
A COURSE ON HOW WE MERGE BOTH OF

04:36:34.945 --> 04:36:36.079
THESE WORLDS.

04:36:36.146 --> 04:36:38.181
BECAUSE I COME FROM A TIME WHEN

04:36:38.248 --> 04:36:39.182
I WORKED AT THE US DEPARTMENT OF

04:36:39.249 --> 04:36:40.450
EDUCATION WHERE I SPENT MY

04:36:40.517 --> 04:36:42.652
WEEKENDS SERVING INTERCITY

04:36:42.719 --> 04:36:45.455
SCHOOLS TRYING TO MAKE IT JUST.

04:36:45.522 --> 04:36:47.290
BUILDING IMPROVEMENTS PAINTING

04:36:47.357 --> 04:36:49.693
REINSTALLING BATHROOM DOORS AND

04:36:49.759 --> 04:36:51.428
AT THE TIME THE CHARTER SCHOOL

04:36:51.494 --> 04:36:53.363
MOVEMENT WAS IN ITS INFANCY AND

04:36:53.430 --> 04:36:54.965
I WOULD HAVE DONE ANYTHING.

04:36:55.031 --> 04:36:57.834
STOP AT NOTHING FOR THOSE KIDS

04:36:57.901 --> 04:36:59.602
TO BE LED BY INNOVATIVE TEACHERS

04:36:59.669 --> 04:37:01.137
AND ADMINISTRATORS IN WHAT WAS

04:37:01.204 --> 04:37:02.939
THE BEGINNING OF A CHARTER

04:37:03.006 --> 04:37:04.140
MOVEMENT.

04:37:04.207 --> 04:37:06.209
IT SHOWED PROMISE AND IN MANY

04:37:06.276 --> 04:37:07.210
CASES AND IN MANY OF YOUR

04:37:07.277 --> 04:37:09.045
COMMUNITIES YES IN FACT IT HAS

04:37:09.112 --> 04:37:11.514
DELIVERED THAT PROMISE.

04:37:11.581 --> 04:37:13.283
BUT WHERE WE COMPLETELY DROPPED

04:37:13.350 --> 04:37:15.085
THE BALL IS IN ENSURING THAT

04:37:15.151 --> 04:37:16.553
WHAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A

04:37:16.619 --> 04:37:17.921
CHARTER SCHOOL MOVEMENT.

04:37:17.988 --> 04:37:19.823
AIMED AT INFORMING A FEEDBACK

04:37:19.889 --> 04:37:21.191
LOOP OF IMPROVING SCHOOLS FOR

04:37:21.257 --> 04:37:23.126
ALL KIDS HAS NOW BECOME ABOUT

04:37:23.193 --> 04:37:26.229
POLITICS AND SILOS WE HAVE A

04:37:26.296 --> 04:37:28.031
UNIQUE MOMENT HERE TO TAKE THAT

04:37:28.098 --> 04:37:29.366
NEXT STEP.

04:37:29.432 --> 04:37:30.834
IN GETTING US IN THAT DIRECTION

04:37:30.900 --> 04:37:32.736
I IS ONE OF THE CO AUTHORS WILL

04:37:32.802 --> 04:37:34.637
TELL YOU THAT I AM COMMITTED. TO

04:37:34.704 --> 04:37:35.972
MOVING THIS VEHICLE ALONG TO

04:37:36.039 --> 04:37:36.973
CONTINUE TO HAVE THAT

04:37:37.040 --> 04:37:38.375
CONVERSATION TO HONOR AND

04:37:38.441 --> 04:37:39.909
RECOGNIZE THE WORK THAT IS BEING

04:37:39.976 --> 04:37:41.277
DONE EVERY DAY RIGHT NOW IN

04:37:41.344 --> 04:37:42.812
GREAT CHARTERS I HAVE SOME IN MY

04:37:42.879 --> 04:37:43.847
COMMUNITY.

04:37:43.913 --> 04:37:45.248
I HAVE GRANADA HILLS CHARTER

04:37:45.315 --> 04:37:46.883
HIGH SCHOOL ACADEMIC DECATHLON

04:37:46.950 --> 04:37:48.451
TOP PERFORMER EVERY YEAR

04:37:48.518 --> 04:37:49.919
NATIONALLY.

04:37:49.986 --> 04:37:51.321
SCV AYE INTERNATIONAL DOES

04:37:51.388 --> 04:37:52.856
FANTASTIC AN INNOVATIVE THINGS

04:37:52.922 --> 04:37:54.391
WITH THEIR STUDENTS WE HAVE TO

04:37:54.457 --> 04:37:55.759
HONOR THAT.

04:37:55.825 --> 04:37:56.993
BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO TAKE THE

04:37:57.060 --> 04:37:58.962
KNOWLEDGE BASE OUT OF THOSE

04:37:59.029 --> 04:37:59.696
CLASSROOMS.

04:37:59.763 --> 04:38:01.631
AND GET SERIOUS ABOUT FUNDING

04:38:01.698 --> 04:38:03.366
THE REST OF PUBLIC EDUCATION SO

04:38:03.433 --> 04:38:04.834
THAT NO FAMILY HOUSE TO MAKE A

04:38:04.901 --> 04:38:06.369
CHOICE.

04:38:06.436 --> 04:38:07.704
THAT'S THE POINT WE'RE AT

04:38:07.771 --> 04:38:08.471
COLLEAGUES.

04:38:08.538 --> 04:38:10.473
FAMILIES SHOULDN'T HAVE TO MAKE

04:38:10.540 --> 04:38:13.276
A CHOICE SO LET US GET THERE LET

04:38:13.343 --> 04:38:14.844
US CONTINUE TO REFINE THIS

04:38:14.911 --> 04:38:16.379
PROCESS TO HAVE THESE

04:38:16.446 --> 04:38:18.548
CONVERSATIONS AND TO MAKE SURE

04:38:18.615 --> 04:38:21.317
THAT EVERY PUBLIC SCHOOL.

04:38:21.384 --> 04:38:24.154
IS A GOOD PUBLIC SCHOOL THIS

04:38:24.220 --> 04:38:25.822
MEASURE HELPS US GET THERE

04:38:25.889 --> 04:38:26.122
[inaudible]

04:38:26.189 --> 04:38:28.191
DOCTOR WEBER [inaudible]

04:38:28.258 --> 04:38:31.428
YOUR RECOGNIZED.

04:38:31.494 --> 04:38:33.963
MISTER SPEAKER IN MEMBERS I RISE --

04:38:34.030 --> 04:38:36.900
IN OPPOSITION.

04:38:36.966 --> 04:38:37.534
TO FIFTEEN OH FIVE I THINK MOST

04:38:37.600 --> 04:38:38.835
OF YOU KNOW THAT -- SO IS NO

04:38:38.902 --> 04:38:40.937
NEWS TO ANYONE I DID NOT GO FOR

04:38:41.004 --> 04:38:42.138
THIS BILL.

04:38:42.205 --> 04:38:43.339
AND I WAS GREATLY CONCERNED EVEN

04:38:43.406 --> 04:38:45.075
IN THE COMMITTEE THAT WHEN THE

04:38:45.141 --> 04:38:47.043
BILL CAME FORWARD IT ALREADY HAD

04:38:47.110 --> 04:38:48.344
WAS PASSED WOULD SEEM LIKE A

04:38:48.411 --> 04:38:49.746
KANGAROO COURT IN MANY WAYS

04:38:49.813 --> 04:38:51.314
BECAUSE THERE WERE HUNDREDS AND

04:38:51.381 --> 04:38:51.881
HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE THERE TO

04:38:51.948 --> 04:38:53.016
SPEAK.

04:38:53.083 --> 04:38:54.350
BUT THE BILL HAVE FOUR AUTHORS

04:38:54.417 --> 04:38:55.985
ON IT AND ALL OF THOSE FOR MOST

04:38:56.052 --> 04:38:57.620
THAT FIVE BUT FOR THOSE

04:38:57.687 --> 04:38:58.221
INDIVIDUALS ARE RIGHT ON THE

04:38:58.288 --> 04:38:59.255
COMMITTEE.

04:38:59.322 --> 04:39:00.857
THE ONLY FOUR VOTES TO PASS IT

04:39:00.924 --> 04:39:01.958
SO THE DONE DEAL IN THE

04:39:02.025 --> 04:39:03.760
COMMITTEE WAS NOT EVEN WORTH

04:39:03.827 --> 04:39:05.495
HAVING CONVERSATION ABOUT.

04:39:05.562 --> 04:39:08.031
BUT MY CONCERN IS FAIRLY SIMPLE

04:39:08.098 --> 04:39:10.500
THIS IS -- THIS IS A SERIOUS

04:39:10.567 --> 04:39:12.602
CONVERSATION.

04:39:12.669 --> 04:39:13.903
THAT SHOULD BE HAPPENING.

04:39:13.970 --> 04:39:15.638
IN THIS HOUSE.

04:39:15.705 --> 04:39:17.240
AMONG A LOT OF PEOPLE AND NOT

04:39:17.307 --> 04:39:18.475
JUST AMONG THE FEW A ONE

04:39:18.541 --> 04:39:19.576
ORGANIZATION OF TWO

04:39:19.642 --> 04:39:20.844
ORGANIZATIONS THAT DECIDE THEY

04:39:20.910 --> 04:39:21.845
WANT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT

04:39:21.911 --> 04:39:23.313
CHARTER SCHOOLS.

04:39:23.379 --> 04:39:24.481
THERE'S VERY LITTLE IN THIS TO

04:39:24.547 --> 04:39:25.915
TALK ABOUT KIDS.

04:39:25.982 --> 04:39:27.217
THE ONE PIECE THAT DOES TALK

04:39:27.283 --> 04:39:29.185
ABOUT KIDS SAYS BUT IT WILL

04:39:29.252 --> 04:39:30.553
REMOVE FROM THE CHARTER

04:39:30.620 --> 04:39:31.588
LEGISLATION.

04:39:31.654 --> 04:39:33.456
WOULD DELETE THE PROVISION

04:39:33.523 --> 04:39:34.691
RELATING A AND I'M MAY I HAVE

04:39:34.757 --> 04:39:36.326
PERMISSION TO READ THE BILL

04:39:36.392 --> 04:39:37.927
OBVIOUSLY TO EVERYBODY.

04:39:37.994 --> 04:39:39.262
WITHOUT OBJECTION THANK YOU IF

04:39:39.329 --> 04:39:40.563
YOU LOOK AT PAGE NINETY FIVE

04:39:40.630 --> 04:39:41.731
SAYS THIS BILL WILL DELETE THE

04:39:41.798 --> 04:39:43.466
PROVISION RELATING TO INCREASES

04:39:43.533 --> 04:39:45.735
IN PUPIL ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT.

04:39:45.802 --> 04:39:48.338
AS THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR.

04:39:48.404 --> 04:39:49.572
THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR IN

04:39:49.639 --> 04:39:51.641
DETERMINING WHETHER TO REVOKE A

04:39:51.708 --> 04:39:53.643
CHARTER.

04:39:53.710 --> 04:39:55.178
THE BILL WOULD ALSO DELETE THE

04:39:55.245 --> 04:39:56.312
PROVISION FOR APPEAL OF THE

04:39:56.379 --> 04:39:58.047
REVOCATION OF A CHART ABOUT

04:39:58.114 --> 04:40:00.250
CHARTERING AUTHORITY. FOR ME THE

04:40:00.316 --> 04:40:01.784
MOST IMPORTANT THING WE SHOULD

04:40:01.851 --> 04:40:02.318
BE TALKING ABOUT A STUDENT

04:40:02.385 --> 04:40:03.553
PERFORMANCE.

04:40:03.620 --> 04:40:05.288
THAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING.

04:40:05.355 --> 04:40:07.023
NOT ALL THE OTHER STUFF BUT MOST

04:40:07.090 --> 04:40:08.858
IMPORTANT THAT BECAUSE THAT IS

04:40:08.925 --> 04:40:10.760
WHAT IS IMPORTANT MY COMMUNITY.

04:40:10.827 --> 04:40:11.728
AND WE CAN TALK ABOUT HOW

04:40:11.794 --> 04:40:13.062
CHARTERS HAVE DONE WHATEVER THAT

04:40:13.129 --> 04:40:14.330
WE THINK THEY'VE DONE TO THE TO

04:40:14.397 --> 04:40:15.398
THE DISTRICTS.

04:40:15.465 --> 04:40:16.666
BUT I CAN ALSO TELL YOU THAT

04:40:16.733 --> 04:40:18.067
PRIOR TO CHARTERS COMING TO

04:40:18.134 --> 04:40:19.502
EXISTENCE THAT WAS ALSO UNDER

04:40:19.569 --> 04:40:21.104
PERFORMANCE IN THOSE COMMUNITIES.

04:40:21.171 --> 04:40:22.372
THAT THAT WASN'T THIS GREAT

04:40:22.438 --> 04:40:24.207
EXPERIENCE IN THE SCHOOLS BUT

04:40:24.274 --> 04:40:25.475
MOST OF THE KIDS WERE IN INNER

04:40:25.542 --> 04:40:26.643
CITIES.

04:40:26.709 --> 04:40:28.144
AND SO IT IT MAKES IT SEEM LIKE

04:40:28.211 --> 04:40:29.245
ALL OF A SUDDEN CHARTER COMES IN

04:40:29.312 --> 04:40:30.647
THEN OBVIOUSLY THINGS HAPPENING

04:40:30.713 --> 04:40:32.348
IN SCHOOLS THAT IS NOT THE CASE

04:40:32.415 --> 04:40:33.483
AND WE KNOW THAT TO BE TRUE.

04:40:33.550 --> 04:40:34.751
BECAUSE YOU ALL AROUND IN THE

04:40:34.817 --> 04:40:35.718
NINETIES AND YOU KNOW WHAT

04:40:35.785 --> 04:40:36.986
HAPPENED IN SCHOOLS IN THE

04:40:37.053 --> 04:40:38.454
ISSUES OF UNDER PERFORMANCE WAS

04:40:38.521 --> 04:40:39.589
STILL THERE.

04:40:39.656 --> 04:40:40.757
I AM CONCERNED THAT THERE ARE A

04:40:40.823 --> 04:40:41.858
LOT OF ISSUES THAT WE NEED TO

04:40:41.925 --> 04:40:43.426
ADDRESS.

04:40:43.493 --> 04:40:44.427
AND AS I STATE IN THE COMMISSION

04:40:44.494 --> 04:40:45.929
THESE THESE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE

04:40:45.995 --> 04:40:48.464
PREMATURE WHY WOULD YOU FORM A

04:40:48.531 --> 04:40:50.066
TASK FORCE YOU WILL SAY GO AHEAD

04:40:50.133 --> 04:40:51.034
AND WE CAN MAKE CHANGES AS WE GO

04:40:51.100 --> 04:40:52.502
ALONG BUT WHY WOULD YOU FORM A

04:40:52.569 --> 04:40:53.469
TASK FORCE.

04:40:53.536 --> 04:40:55.572
WHOSE JOB IS TO ADDRESS THE

04:40:55.638 --> 04:40:57.106
ISSUES OF CHARTERING AN

04:40:57.173 --> 04:40:59.676
AUTHORIZATION AND FINANCES.

04:40:59.742 --> 04:41:01.377
AND BRING TOGETHER PEOPLE FROM

04:41:01.444 --> 04:41:03.146
CHARTERS FROM SCHOOL DISTRICT

04:41:03.213 --> 04:41:04.280
FROM LEADERSHIP ALTHOUGH SO

04:41:04.347 --> 04:41:06.182
TOGETHER TO LOOK AT THIS VERY

04:41:06.249 --> 04:41:07.684
COMPLEX ISSUE.

04:41:07.750 --> 04:41:09.419
WE TRY TO BE FAIR ABOUT IT AND

04:41:09.485 --> 04:41:11.554
THEN WE ALSO LEGISLATION PUSH IT

04:41:11.621 --> 04:41:12.822
FORWARD WITH THE IDEA THAT WE AS

04:41:12.889 --> 04:41:14.190
A SOMETHING WILL HAPPEN IN THE

04:41:14.257 --> 04:41:15.658
NEXT FEW MONTHS.

04:41:15.725 --> 04:41:16.993
PUSH IT FORWARD.

04:41:17.060 --> 04:41:18.161
SO THEN IT BECOMES EVEN MORE

04:41:18.228 --> 04:41:20.830
DIFFICULT TO AMEND AND TO CHANGE.

04:41:20.897 --> 04:41:22.532
AND WE ALL KNOW THAT.

04:41:22.599 --> 04:41:23.967
AND THAT'S WHY THE EVIDENCE IS

04:41:24.033 --> 04:41:24.901
IN HERE BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT

04:41:24.968 --> 04:41:26.169
THIS THERE'S VERY LITTLE IN THIS

04:41:26.236 --> 04:41:28.238
BILL THE TALKS ABOUT WHAT'S

04:41:28.304 --> 04:41:29.072
GOING TO HAPPEN FOR KIDS IN

04:41:29.138 --> 04:41:30.940
TERMS OF PERFORMANCE ACADEMIC

04:41:31.007 --> 04:41:32.075
EXCELLENCE.

04:41:32.141 --> 04:41:32.709
THOSE KINDS OF THINGS THAT ARE

04:41:32.775 --> 04:41:35.445
THE MOST OF OUR COMMUNITIES ARE

04:41:35.511 --> 04:41:37.380
CLAMORING FOR BETTER SCHOOLS.

04:41:37.447 --> 04:41:38.381
AND WITH US TO COME IN AND

04:41:38.448 --> 04:41:40.917
CREATE A PROCESS THAT ONE MAY

04:41:40.984 --> 04:41:42.752
DID NOT THEM AN OPPORTUNITY

04:41:42.819 --> 04:41:44.087
THERE SOME DISTRICTS TO DO VERY

04:41:44.153 --> 04:41:45.255
GOOD JOB AND I SOMEHOW DON'T.

04:41:45.321 --> 04:41:46.289
AND WE NEED TO BE AWARE OF THAT

04:41:46.356 --> 04:41:47.423
IN TERMS OF THE BOARDS

04:41:47.490 --> 04:41:49.058
THEMSELVES IN CHARTERING AND IF

04:41:49.125 --> 04:41:51.194
THE MAIN REASON TO ACCEPT OR

04:41:51.261 --> 04:41:52.395
DENY A CHARTER IS BASED ON HIS

04:41:52.462 --> 04:41:54.364
FINANCIAL ISSUES WITH THE

04:41:54.430 --> 04:41:56.032
CURRENT SCHOOL DISTRICTS.

04:41:56.099 --> 04:42:02.505
MANY MANY OF OUR CHARTS WOULD

04:42:02.572 --> 04:42:03.439
NEVER GET CHARTER.

04:42:03.506 --> 04:42:04.007
BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT IT

04:42:04.073 --> 04:42:05.375
WOULD IS GOING TO IMPACT THE

04:42:05.441 --> 04:42:06.676
ECONOMICS AS THEIR WE THOUGHT

04:42:06.743 --> 04:42:07.277
CHARTERS WE'RE GOING TO INFORM

04:42:07.343 --> 04:42:08.811
DISTRICTS ABOUT HOW TO BE BETTER.

04:42:08.878 --> 04:42:09.612
AND INSTEAD THEY HAVE BECOME THE

04:42:09.679 --> 04:42:10.079
ENEMY OF EACH OTHER.

04:42:10.146 --> 04:42:10.880
AND WE NEED TO GET BACK TO THAT

04:42:10.947 --> 04:42:12.849
BUT THISBILL WILL MAKE THEM

04:42:12.915 --> 04:42:13.916
EVEN MORE ENEMIES.

04:42:13.983 --> 04:42:15.318
BECAUSE I CHARTERS ARE CONCERNED

04:42:15.385 --> 04:42:17.086
THAT THEY WERE NOT INCLUDED IN

04:42:17.153 --> 04:42:18.354
THE CONVERSATION.

04:42:18.421 --> 04:42:19.289
THEY'RE CONCERNED THAT THIS

04:42:19.355 --> 04:42:20.723
WOULD MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR

04:42:20.790 --> 04:42:22.191
THEM TO ACTUALLY GET A CHARTER

04:42:22.258 --> 04:42:23.426
BECAUSE NOW THEY ONLY HAVE THE

04:42:23.493 --> 04:42:24.761
BOARD TO DEAL WITH IN THE

04:42:24.827 --> 04:42:26.129
POLITICS OF THE LOCAL BOARD TO

04:42:26.195 --> 04:42:27.664
HAVING BEEN ON ONE BEFORE I KNOW

04:42:27.730 --> 04:42:28.865
WHAT THEY ARE.

04:42:28.931 --> 04:42:30.767
AND NO APPEAL PROCESS THAT

04:42:30.833 --> 04:42:32.168
SOUNDS SO UNFAIR TO ME AND IN A

04:42:32.235 --> 04:42:33.536
DEMOCRACY THAT YOU CAN MAKE A

04:42:33.603 --> 04:42:34.837
DECISION AND I DON'T EVEN HAVE

04:42:34.904 --> 04:42:36.272
AN OPPORTUNITY TO APPEAL TO A

04:42:36.339 --> 04:42:38.574
HIGHER POWER. TO ANOTHER BOARD

04:42:38.641 --> 04:42:39.676
WE HAVE A STATE BARD THAT'S

04:42:39.742 --> 04:42:41.110
BEEN AUTHORIZED TO DO TO

04:42:41.177 --> 04:42:42.612
BASICALLY HANDLE THE EDUCATION

04:42:42.679 --> 04:42:44.213
OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

04:42:44.280 --> 04:42:45.782
AND SO WITH WOOD WHAT CUTTING

04:42:45.848 --> 04:42:47.250
OFF THOSE AVENUES AND MAKING IT

04:42:47.317 --> 04:42:48.985
ONLY SO THAT THEY CAN ONLY GO

04:42:49.052 --> 04:42:50.153
ONE WAY.

04:42:50.219 --> 04:42:51.888
I THINK THIS IS PREMATURE.

04:42:51.954 --> 04:42:53.056
I THINK THAT THE ISSUES ARE MUCH

04:42:53.122 --> 04:42:55.692
MORE DIFFICULT AND COMPLEX AND

04:42:55.758 --> 04:42:56.326
OUR CONSTITUENTS ARE TELLING US

04:42:56.392 --> 04:42:57.126
THAT.

04:42:57.193 --> 04:42:58.761
AND THAT WE ARE NOT PREPARED TO

04:42:58.828 --> 04:43:00.163
MAKE THESE KINDS OF DECISIONS

04:43:00.229 --> 04:43:01.964
ABSENCE OF A REPORT THAT COMES

04:43:02.031 --> 04:43:03.800
OUT TO TELL US HOW ARE STE

04:43:03.866 --> 04:43:05.501
WHAT'S GOING ON IN OUR CHARTERS

04:43:05.568 --> 04:43:07.270
HOW TO BEST AUTHORIZES CHARTERS

04:43:07.337 --> 04:43:08.204
WHAT KIND OF ISSUES NEED TO BE

04:43:08.271 --> 04:43:08.738
THERE.

04:43:08.805 --> 04:43:09.939
CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS WE MAY WE

04:43:10.006 --> 04:43:11.641
MADE ASSUMPTIONS IN HERE THAT

04:43:11.708 --> 04:43:12.675
THE CHARGES ARE BREAKING THE

04:43:12.742 --> 04:43:16.913
SCHOOLS FINANCIALLY WE MAY

04:43:16.979 --> 04:43:17.547
DISCOVER THE REPORT THAT THAT'S

04:43:17.613 --> 04:43:18.514
NOT TRUE.

04:43:18.581 --> 04:43:19.148
THAT THAT IS NOT TRUE.

04:43:19.215 --> 04:43:19.716
BECAUSE THEY'RE TAKING THE

04:43:19.782 --> 04:43:20.483
CHILDREN OBVIOUSLY THEY NEED THE

04:43:20.550 --> 04:43:22.018
RESOURCES TO WORK WITH THE KIDS.

04:43:22.085 --> 04:43:23.286
JUST A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS

04:43:23.353 --> 04:43:26.155
THAT WE ARE UNPREPARED TO ANSWER

04:43:26.222 --> 04:43:27.690
AND TO RUSH THIS BILL THROUGH

04:43:27.757 --> 04:43:29.258
EVEN HANG IT UP THE AND WHAT

04:43:29.325 --> 04:43:29.892
WE'VE DONE EVERYTHING ELSE AND

04:43:29.959 --> 04:43:31.260
ALL WAS A SURPRISE AND NOW IT'S

04:43:31.327 --> 04:43:32.395
COMING FORWARD.

04:43:32.462 --> 04:43:33.696
YOU KNOW THAT IN ITSELF IS

04:43:33.763 --> 04:43:35.098
RATHER INTERESTING.

04:43:35.164 --> 04:43:36.899
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY WE ARE NOT

04:43:36.966 --> 04:43:38.234
PREPARED TO MAKE THIS DECISION

04:43:38.301 --> 04:43:40.036
AND I WOULD ARGUE I WOULD URGE

04:43:40.103 --> 04:43:41.337
YOU NOT TO EITHER TO ABSTAIN

04:43:41.404 --> 04:43:42.772
WHICH REALLY NOT TO VOTE FOR

04:43:42.839 --> 04:43:43.873
THIS BILL AT THIS TIME BECAUSE

04:43:43.940 --> 04:43:45.475
THERE'S MUCH MORE INFORMATION

04:43:45.541 --> 04:43:46.142
NECESSARY.

04:43:46.209 --> 04:43:49.145
AND WE TO INCLUDE MORE PEOPLE IN

04:43:49.212 --> 04:43:49.746
THE CONVERSATION THANK YOU SO

04:43:49.812 --> 04:43:51.481
VERY MUCH.

04:43:51.547 --> 04:43:52.749
THANK GOD WEBER MISTRUST AN

04:43:52.815 --> 04:43:55.385
OLDIE YOU ARE RECOGNIZED.

04:43:55.451 --> 04:43:57.787
COLLEAGUES I RISE IN RESPECTFUL

04:43:57.854 --> 04:43:59.455
OPPOSITION TO FIFTEEN OH FIVE

04:43:59.522 --> 04:44:00.289
AND I'D LIKE TO RELATE A

04:44:00.356 --> 04:44:01.357
PERSONAL STORY I DON'T THINK

04:44:01.424 --> 04:44:03.359
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT ANYONE IN

04:44:03.426 --> 04:44:04.861
THIS CHAMBER KNOWS ABOUT ME BUT

04:44:04.927 --> 04:44:06.829
MY OLDEST SON.

04:44:06.896 --> 04:44:08.564
HAD SOME SEVERE BEHAVIORAL

04:44:08.631 --> 04:44:10.032
PROBLEMS WHEN HE WAS YOUNGER HE

04:44:10.099 --> 04:44:12.235
WAS BORN WITH A ADVANCED

04:44:12.301 --> 04:44:13.803
INTELLECTUAL CAPACITY IN A

04:44:13.870 --> 04:44:15.204
DIMINISHED EMOTIONAL CAPACITY.

04:44:15.271 --> 04:44:16.773
AND LIKE MANY GIFTED CHILDREN

04:44:16.839 --> 04:44:18.408
THAT CAUSED HIM A LOT OF

04:44:18.474 --> 04:44:20.276
PROBLEMS EARLY IN HIS LIFE.

04:44:20.343 --> 04:44:22.879
WHEN IT CAME TIME TO SEND HIM TO

04:44:22.945 --> 04:44:24.046
KINDERGARTEN?

04:44:24.113 --> 04:44:26.182
WE HAD A REALLY STARK DECISION

04:44:26.249 --> 04:44:27.984
TO MAKE BECAUSE SENDING HIM TO

04:44:28.050 --> 04:44:29.819
SCHOOL WITH OTHER CHILDREN WOULD

04:44:29.886 --> 04:44:31.320
HAVE REQUIRED MEDICATING HIM.

04:44:31.387 --> 04:44:33.256
AND MY WIFE AND I WERE UNWILLING

04:44:33.322 --> 04:44:34.157
TO DO THAT.

04:44:34.223 --> 04:44:35.858
SO WE MADE THE CHOICE TO HOME

04:44:35.925 --> 04:44:36.959
SCHOOL HIM BUT IT WAS A

04:44:37.026 --> 04:44:38.628
DIFFICULT CHOICE BECAUSE I DON'T

04:44:38.694 --> 04:44:39.362
HAVE A TEACHING CREDENTIAL I

04:44:39.429 --> 04:44:40.096
DON'T.

04:44:40.163 --> 04:44:42.131
THINK THAT I'M QUALIFIED TO

04:44:42.198 --> 04:44:43.132
TEACH A CHILD.

04:44:43.199 --> 04:44:44.534
YEAH MY WIFE FELT THE SAME WAY

04:44:44.600 --> 04:44:47.303
SO WE HOME SCHOOLED WITH THE AID

04:44:47.370 --> 04:44:48.738
OF A CHARTER SCHOOL AND WAS A

04:44:48.805 --> 04:44:50.239
VIRTUAL ACADEMY IT TURNED OUT TO

04:44:50.306 --> 04:44:51.774
BE PERFECT FOR US WE COULD GO

04:44:51.841 --> 04:44:53.309
ONLINE EVERY DAY.

04:44:53.376 --> 04:44:55.144
WE HAD A LESSON PLAN WE GOT

04:44:55.211 --> 04:44:57.914
WEEKLY VISITS FROM A CERTIFIED

04:44:57.980 --> 04:44:59.482
TEACHER WE PARTICIPATED IN

04:44:59.549 --> 04:45:01.017
STANDARDIZED TESTING THEY GAVE

04:45:01.083 --> 04:45:03.219
US THE CONFIDENCE THAT WE NEEDED.

04:45:03.286 --> 04:45:04.687
TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT.

04:45:04.754 --> 04:45:07.089
AND WHEN IT CAME TIME. FOR HIM

04:45:07.156 --> 04:45:09.058

04:45:15.698 --> 04:45:16.933

04:45:28.711 --> 04:45:30.012
TELL I'M VERY PROUD OF HIM.

04:45:30.079 --> 04:45:31.113
WE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO

04:45:31.180 --> 04:45:32.682
DO THAT.

04:45:32.748 --> 04:45:35.117
WITHOUT THE AID OF THE CHARTER

04:45:35.184 --> 04:45:36.586
SCHOOL THAT WE PARTICIPATED IN.

04:45:36.652 --> 04:45:37.587
AND THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS I

04:45:37.653 --> 04:45:39.088
FEEL SO STRONGLY ABOUT THIS AND

04:45:39.155 --> 04:45:40.256

SHUTTING DOWN CHARTER SCHOOLS

04:45:47.563 --> 04:45:48.097

04:45:52.602 --> 04:45:54.003
HIGHER ACADEMIC RESULTS.

04:45:54.070 --> 04:45:55.438
THAN -- OTHER SCHOOLS IN THE

04:45:55.505 --> 04:45:56.806
PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM BUT THERE

04:45:56.873 --> 04:45:58.374
ARE A LOT OF KIDS FOR WHOM

04:45:58.441 --> 04:45:59.942
CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE THE BEST

04:46:00.009 --> 04:46:01.310
OPTIONS AND THERE ARE OTHER

04:46:01.377 --> 04:46:02.144
THINGS IN THIS BILL OTHER

04:46:02.211 --> 04:46:03.045
PROVISIONS.

04:46:03.112 --> 04:46:04.814
THAT ARE CLEARLY INTENDED TO

04:46:04.881 --> 04:46:06.415
LIMIT THE NUMBER OF CHARTER

04:46:06.482 --> 04:46:08.017
SCHOOLS IN CALIFORNIA TO MAKE

04:46:08.084 --> 04:46:09.385
SURE THAT CHARTER SCHOOLS DON'T

04:46:09.452 --> 04:46:10.887
GET THEIR CHARTERS RENEWED AND A

04:46:10.953 --> 04:46:12.021
LOT OF THE CHARTERS WILL BE SHUT

04:46:12.088 --> 04:46:12.555
DOWN.

04:46:12.622 --> 04:46:14.257
UNDER THIS BILL ARE THE GOOD

04:46:14.323 --> 04:46:15.024

THAT STUDENTS LEARN ABOUT THAT

04:47:01.504 --> 04:47:05.341
HISTORICAL OF THAT IN.

04:47:05.408 --> 04:47:06.609
NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT AND I KNOW

WERE TRACKED.

04:47:16.786 --> 04:47:20.256

NOT COLLEGE BOUND NINETEEN SIXTY

04:47:25.394 --> 04:47:25.928

THAN [inaudible] TEN COLLEGE

04:47:28.631 --> 04:47:30.199
LATINO COLLEGE STUDENTS

04:47:30.266 --> 04:47:31.867
ATTENDING UCLA.

THE HUNDRED YEAR.

04:47:35.972 --> 04:47:37.373
OF UCLA.

04:47:37.440 --> 04:47:40.009
AND THE NUMBER OF LATINOS IT

04:47:40.076 --> 04:47:41.877
UCLA TODAY.

04:47:41.944 --> 04:47:44.847
IS MANY MANY TIMES MORE THAN IT

04:47:44.914 --> 04:47:47.550
WAS IN.

04:47:47.617 --> 04:47:48.117
NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT BUT THE

04:47:48.184 --> 04:47:51.020
STUDENTS THAT WALKED OUT IN.

04:47:51.087 --> 04:47:51.654
NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT WE'RE VERY

04:47:51.721 --> 04:47:53.055
SIMILAR TO THE STUDENTS THAT

04:47:53.122 --> 04:47:55.157
WALKED OUT IN LA UNIFIED

04:47:55.224 --> 04:47:55.458
[inaudible]

04:47:55.524 --> 04:47:57.660
THIS YEAR.

04:47:57.727 --> 04:48:00.062
AND I WAS IN LA.

04:48:00.129 --> 04:48:02.531
I WAS AT MADISON HIGH SCHOOL IN

04:48:02.598 --> 04:48:04.033
LOS ANGELES.

04:48:04.100 --> 04:48:07.069
AND WHEN I WALKED MARCHED AND

04:48:07.136 --> 04:48:09.005
CHANTED WITH THE STUDENTS

04:48:09.071 --> 04:48:12.108
PARENTS [inaudible]

04:48:12.174 --> 04:48:14.543
AND TEACHERS.

04:48:14.610 --> 04:48:18.514
OF UC OF OF OF LA UNIFIED SCHOOL

04:48:18.581 --> 04:48:20.683
DISTRICT I WAS VERY MUCH

04:48:20.750 --> 04:48:21.717
REMINDED.

04:48:21.784 --> 04:48:26.956
OF THE WALKED OUT OF NINETEEN

04:48:27.023 --> 04:48:28.324
SIXTY EIGHT AND I DO THINK THAT

04:48:28.391 --> 04:48:29.759
WE ARE AT A JUNCTURE.

04:48:29.825 --> 04:48:32.161
WHERE WE DO NEED TO DECIDE?

04:48:32.228 --> 04:48:34.697
ARE WE OR ARE WE NOT GONNA

04:48:34.764 --> 04:48:38.634
SUPPORT PUBLIC SCHOOLS.

04:48:38.701 --> 04:48:40.436
THE HISTORY OF PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN

04:48:40.503 --> 04:48:41.637
THIS NATION.

04:48:41.704 --> 04:48:44.240
IS THIS A SYSTEM THAT SAID IT

04:48:44.306 --> 04:48:46.275
WAS FOR EVERYONE.

04:48:46.342 --> 04:48:48.177
BEFORE THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS IT WAS

04:48:48.244 --> 04:48:51.080
ONLY THE FEW WHO WERE EDUCATED.

04:48:51.147 --> 04:48:52.581
BUT THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS CAME

04:48:52.648 --> 04:48:54.083
ABOUT IN THIS NATION WHEN

04:48:54.150 --> 04:48:55.451
IMMIGRANTS.

04:48:55.518 --> 04:48:56.585
WITH IMMIGRANTS.

04:48:56.652 --> 04:48:59.755
CAME ONTO THE SHORES.

04:48:59.822 --> 04:49:02.458
AND THE UNITED STATES NEW AND

04:49:02.525 --> 04:49:04.293
RECOGNIZE THAT WE HAD TO EDUCATE

04:49:04.360 --> 04:49:05.828
ALL.

04:49:05.895 --> 04:49:06.862
AND THAT IS WHEN THE PUBLIC

04:49:06.929 --> 04:49:08.030
SCHOOL STARTED IN THE UNITED

04:49:08.097 --> 04:49:10.232
STATES.

04:49:10.299 --> 04:49:11.534
SO WE NEED TO DECIDE

04:49:11.600 --> 04:49:11.834
[inaudible]

04:49:11.901 --> 04:49:13.969
TODAY.

04:49:14.036 --> 04:49:16.072
WILL WE CONTINUE TO SUPPORT

04:49:16.138 --> 04:49:18.207
PUBLIC EDUCATION.

04:49:18.274 --> 04:49:20.810
I VERY MUCH AGREE.

04:49:20.876 --> 04:49:22.478
THAT IT IS A DECISION THAT WE

04:49:22.545 --> 04:49:23.846
HAVE TO MAKE AND THAT.

04:49:23.913 --> 04:49:25.181
BEING NUMBER FORTY ONE IN THE

04:49:25.247 --> 04:49:26.982
NATION.

04:49:27.049 --> 04:49:28.651
IN FUNDING PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND

04:49:28.718 --> 04:49:31.087
HAVING THE LARGEST CLASS SIZE

04:49:31.153 --> 04:49:31.387
[inaudible]

04:49:31.454 --> 04:49:33.389
PER TEACHER.

04:49:33.456 --> 04:49:34.790
HAVING THE LESS.

04:49:34.857 --> 04:49:37.293
AMOUNT OF COUNSELORS PER STUDENT.

04:49:37.359 --> 04:49:39.729
IS NOT ACCEPTABLE.

04:49:39.795 --> 04:49:42.298
AND WE SAW.

04:49:42.364 --> 04:49:43.766
DURING THE LA UNIFIED.

04:49:43.833 --> 04:49:45.601
TEACHERS STRIKE.

04:49:45.668 --> 04:49:48.938
THAT CHARTERS DO DRAW UPON.

04:49:49.004 --> 04:49:50.439
AND TAKE AWAY FROM PUBLIC

04:49:50.506 --> 04:49:52.942
SCHOOLS AND WHAT BEGAN AS A

04:49:53.008 --> 04:49:56.212
MODEL IS NOW BECOME AN INDUSTRY.

04:49:56.278 --> 04:49:58.581
AN INDUSTRY THAT TAKES AWAY FROM

04:49:58.647 --> 04:50:00.716
PUBLIC SCHOOLS I THINK IT IS

04:50:00.783 --> 04:50:03.652
IMPORTANT THAT WE RECOGNIZE THAT

04:50:03.719 --> 04:50:06.322
WHEN IT COMES TO EDUCATION.

04:50:06.388 --> 04:50:08.657
DECISIONS ARE MADE BASS WHEN

04:50:08.724 --> 04:50:10.860
THEY ARE CLOSE TO HOME THERE IS

04:50:10.926 --> 04:50:12.561
NO BETTER ENTITY TO MAKE THE

04:50:12.628 --> 04:50:14.063
DECISIONS THAT THE SCHOOL BOARD

04:50:14.130 --> 04:50:15.564
AND I SAY THAT BOTH.

04:50:15.631 --> 04:50:17.967
AS A TEACHER AND A PAST SCHOOL

04:50:18.033 --> 04:50:20.302
BOARD MEMBER I URGE YOU TO VOTE

04:50:20.369 --> 04:50:24.807
YES ON A. B..

04:50:24.874 --> 04:50:25.741
FIFTEEN OH FIVE MS GONZALEZ YOU

04:50:25.808 --> 04:50:29.445
ARE RECOGNIZED.

04:50:29.512 --> 04:50:31.514
I'M GONNA START BY ADMITTING

04:50:31.580 --> 04:50:33.182
THIS IS A TOUGH SUBJECT.

04:50:33.249 --> 04:50:34.483
A LOT OF YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY I

04:50:34.550 --> 04:50:36.051
CAME FROM THE LABOR MOVEMENT.

04:50:36.118 --> 04:50:39.155
I REPRESENTED -- TEACHERS.

04:50:39.221 --> 04:50:39.688
I'M ALSO A CHARTER SCHOOL

04:50:39.755 --> 04:50:41.724
PARENTS.

04:50:41.791 --> 04:50:43.592
AND AND THAT'S NOT ALWAYS EASY

04:50:43.659 --> 04:50:45.294
TO ADMIT.

04:50:45.361 --> 04:50:46.996
THERE'S A CONFLICT THERE

04:50:47.062 --> 04:50:47.296
[inaudible]

04:50:47.363 --> 04:50:51.267
AND I COULD PROBABLY TELL YOU IN

04:50:51.333 --> 04:50:51.901
DOUBT.

04:50:51.967 --> 04:50:54.303
EVERYTHING GOOD OR BAD.

04:50:54.370 --> 04:50:56.939
ABOUT MY KIDS SCHOOLS.

04:50:57.006 --> 04:50:59.375
I SEE IT UP CLOSE.

04:50:59.441 --> 04:51:01.143
I SEE THE FACT.

04:51:01.210 --> 04:51:03.212
THAT MY KIDS GO TO A SCHOOL

04:51:03.279 --> 04:51:04.780
DESPITE A DISTRICT THAT

04:51:04.847 --> 04:51:06.882
OVERWHELMINGLY LATINO IN SPANISH

04:51:06.949 --> 04:51:09.118
SPEAKING. TO A SCHOOL THAT I'VE

04:51:09.185 --> 04:51:12.221
NEVER SEEN AN ENGLISH LEARNER AT

04:51:12.288 --> 04:51:13.422
I'VE NEVER SEEN A SPECIAL ED

04:51:13.489 --> 04:51:16.292
STUDENTS.

04:51:16.358 --> 04:51:17.760
ON THE ONE HAND I COMPLETELY

04:51:17.827 --> 04:51:20.462
AGREE WITH THE INNOVATION.

04:51:20.529 --> 04:51:21.497
THAT SOME CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE

04:51:21.564 --> 04:51:22.665
ENGAGING IN.

04:51:22.731 --> 04:51:23.966
AND MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE

04:51:24.033 --> 04:51:25.634
MOVEMENT IS IT WAS SUPPOSED TO

04:51:25.701 --> 04:51:26.969
BE VERY LIMITED.

04:51:27.036 --> 04:51:28.137
IN THAT WE WERE SUPPOSED TO TAKE

04:51:28.204 --> 04:51:30.606
THAT INNOVATION AND SCALE IT.

04:51:30.673 --> 04:51:32.541
SO THAT EVERY KID IN EVERY

04:51:32.608 --> 04:51:34.677
PUBLIC SCHOOL WOULD HAVE THOSE

04:51:34.743 --> 04:51:36.312
SAME OPPORTUNITIES.

04:51:36.378 --> 04:51:37.913
MY KIDS ATTEND.

04:51:37.980 --> 04:51:39.748
COOPERATIVE CHARTER SCHOOLS IT

04:51:39.815 --> 04:51:41.417
DIDN'T START THAT WAY.

04:51:41.483 --> 04:51:43.819
START WITH ONE OR TWO IT'S

04:51:43.886 --> 04:51:44.687
CALLED HIGH TECH HIGH IT'S VERY

04:51:44.753 --> 04:51:46.889
FAMOUS.

04:51:46.956 --> 04:51:48.724
AND WHEN IT STARTED THERE WAS

04:51:48.791 --> 04:51:50.259
NOTHING TO NOT LOVE ABOUT IT

04:51:50.326 --> 04:51:51.994
BESIDES THE LACK OF DIVERSITY

04:51:52.061 --> 04:51:53.596
WHICH HAS ALWAYS BOTHERED ME

04:51:53.662 --> 04:51:54.997
IT'S SOMETHING THAT CAUSED MY

04:51:55.064 --> 04:51:56.665
DAUGHTER.

04:51:56.732 --> 04:51:58.467
BEING HALF BLACK AND HALF LATINA

04:51:58.534 --> 04:52:00.069
TO PULL HERSELF.

04:52:00.135 --> 04:52:01.770
OUT OF A CHARTER SCHOOL BECAUSE

04:52:01.837 --> 04:52:03.339
SHE WAS SICK OF BEING PARADED

04:52:03.405 --> 04:52:06.542
AROUND FOR AUTHORIZES AS IF SHE

04:52:06.609 --> 04:52:08.544
WAS REPRESENTATIVE OF THE SCHOOL.

04:52:08.611 --> 04:52:11.380
SHE SAID THIS IS AT AT TEN COULD

04:52:11.447 --> 04:52:13.515
SAY THIS IS WRONG.

04:52:13.582 --> 04:52:14.550
THEY WANT TO ACT LIKE THIS IS

04:52:14.617 --> 04:52:16.252
SOMETHING THAT IT'S NOT IT'S NOT

04:52:16.318 --> 04:52:19.188
SERVING STUDENTS LIKE ME.

04:52:19.255 --> 04:52:20.956
MAYBE BECAUSE WORK HAVE A LITTLE

04:52:21.023 --> 04:52:22.691
BIT MORE MONEY THAN THE PEOPLE

04:52:22.758 --> 04:52:25.160
IN OUR DISTRICT BUT IT'S NOT.

04:52:25.227 --> 04:52:27.596
AND SO BECAME THIS IDEA BUT NOW

04:52:27.663 --> 04:52:29.265
EVEN A GRADE SCHOOL LIKE HIGH

04:52:29.331 --> 04:52:30.032
TECH HIGH.

04:52:30.099 --> 04:52:33.002
CONTINUES TO OPEN UP ANOTHER AND

04:52:33.068 --> 04:52:34.503
ANOTHER AND ANOTHER SCHOOL.

04:52:34.570 --> 04:52:35.905
SO SCHOOL THAT USED TO BE KIND

04:52:35.971 --> 04:52:37.806
OF A NEIGHBORHOOD SERVING AREA

04:52:37.873 --> 04:52:40.643
SCHOOL NOW HAS INTO ASSEMBLY

04:52:40.709 --> 04:52:41.410
DISTRICTS AWAY ANOTHER HIGH

04:52:41.477 --> 04:52:42.311
SCHOOL.

04:52:42.378 --> 04:52:45.314
IT HAS FIVE OR SIX HIGH SCHOOLS.

04:52:45.381 --> 04:52:46.682
TWO OR THREE ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS

04:52:46.749 --> 04:52:48.284
FOUR MIDDLE SCHOOLS AND WHAT

04:52:48.350 --> 04:52:49.551
HAPPENS IS THESE EACHERS WHO

04:52:49.618 --> 04:52:51.086
PUT IN TIME AT A SCHOOL GET

04:52:51.153 --> 04:52:52.354
MOVED AROUND FROM SCHOOL TO

04:52:52.421 --> 04:52:53.322
SCHOOL.

04:52:53.389 --> 04:52:54.823
SO YOUR BEST MOST QUALIFIED

04:52:54.890 --> 04:52:58.060
TEACHERS ARE BEING MOVED OUT OF

04:52:58.127 --> 04:52:59.028
WHAT USED TO BE A LITTLE GREAT

04:52:59.094 --> 04:52:59.328
[inaudible]

04:52:59.395 --> 04:53:01.864
BET.

04:53:01.931 --> 04:53:04.867
OF OF OF EXPERIMENT.

04:53:04.934 --> 04:53:06.035
OF TRYING THINGS AND MAKING THEM

04:53:06.101 --> 04:53:07.569
WORK.

04:53:07.636 --> 04:53:09.305
OF ACTUALLY CREATING A MARKET

04:53:09.371 --> 04:53:10.539
PLACE OF THE TEACHERS WERE

04:53:10.606 --> 04:53:12.041
PROVIDED.

04:53:12.107 --> 04:53:13.542
A GOOD SALARY AND AND THE

04:53:13.609 --> 04:53:15.277
INCENTIVE TO STAY THERE IS NOW

04:53:15.344 --> 04:53:17.012
BEING DESTROYED BECAUSE AS THAT

04:53:17.079 --> 04:53:18.247
GROWS.

04:53:18.314 --> 04:53:20.549
THAT'S NOT BE PROVIDED WERE SEEN

04:53:20.616 --> 04:53:21.717
IN OUR LOCAL ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

04:53:21.784 --> 04:53:24.553
SITUATION BY WHICH TO TEACHERS.

04:53:24.620 --> 04:53:25.387
TO TEACHERS WHO HAVE BEEN

04:53:25.454 --> 04:53:26.755
LONGEST SERVING THERE AND HAVE

04:53:26.822 --> 04:53:28.724
GREAT RECORDS THEY ARE THE STATE

04:53:28.791 --> 04:53:30.926
THE TEACHERS WHO PROVIDE THE

04:53:30.993 --> 04:53:32.227
MOST TO STUDENTS.

04:53:32.294 --> 04:53:33.595
ARE ARE NOT BEING HAVING THEIR

04:53:33.662 --> 04:53:35.531
CONTRACTS RENEWED BECAUSE THE

04:53:35.597 --> 04:53:37.566
CHARTER SCHOOL.

04:53:37.633 --> 04:53:39.702
HAS NO BASIS BY WHICH THEY KEEP

04:53:39.768 --> 04:53:41.603
A TEACHER R. DON'T AND ONCE YOU

04:53:41.670 --> 04:53:42.638
BECOME TOO EXPENSIVE.

04:53:42.705 --> 04:53:44.940
YOU'RE EXPENDABLE.

04:53:45.007 --> 04:53:46.508
THAT NOT ONLY HURTS THE TEACHER

04:53:46.575 --> 04:53:47.576
BUT IT HURTS EVERY KID IN THAT

04:53:47.643 --> 04:53:49.411
SCHOOL.

04:53:49.478 --> 04:53:51.180
ALL I CAN SAY IS CHARTER SCHOOLS

04:53:51.246 --> 04:53:53.115
ARE NOT ON ITS OWN.

04:53:53.182 --> 04:53:55.951
A BAD IDEA I SUPPORT CHOI HAVING

04:53:56.018 --> 04:53:59.288
SOME LIMITED CHARTER SCHOOLS.

04:53:59.355 --> 04:54:01.724
I I I I HAVE ALWAYS TOLD THE

04:54:01.790 --> 04:54:03.025
TEACHERS UNION THAT TO OPPOSE

04:54:03.092 --> 04:54:04.293
ALL CHARTER SCHOOLS SEEM

04:54:04.360 --> 04:54:05.561
COUNTERPRODUCTIVE.

04:54:05.627 --> 04:54:06.862
THIS IS HOW THIS IS SOMETHING

04:54:06.929 --> 04:54:08.664
THAT ALL TEACHERS SHOULD WANT TO

04:54:08.731 --> 04:54:10.833
NOT HAVE TO ABIDE BY SOME STREET

04:54:10.899 --> 04:54:12.134
CURRICULUM TO BE ABLE TO

04:54:12.201 --> 04:54:14.770
EXPERIMENT. TO TO HAVE NEW LIVE

04:54:14.837 --> 04:54:16.205
LEARNING STANDARDS FOR ALL KINDS

04:54:16.271 --> 04:54:17.706
OF DIFFERENT KIDS BUT THAT'S NOT

04:54:17.773 --> 04:54:19.208
WHAT'S HAPPENING ANYMORE.

04:54:19.274 --> 04:54:21.710
AND WE'RE LEAVING BEHIND SO MANY

04:54:21.777 --> 04:54:23.479
KIDS.

04:54:23.545 --> 04:54:24.313
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO RECONCILE

04:54:24.380 --> 04:54:25.180
THAT.

04:54:25.247 --> 04:54:27.950
I'VE BEEN CALLED A HYPOCRITE AN

04:54:28.017 --> 04:54:29.485
IN THAT'S I UNDERSTAND WHY

04:54:29.551 --> 04:54:31.086
PEOPLE WOULD.

04:54:31.153 --> 04:54:31.920
I'M NOT SAYING THIS CHARTER

04:54:31.987 --> 04:54:33.322
SCHOOLS GOOD ENOUGH FOR MY KIDS

04:54:33.389 --> 04:54:34.723
BUT NOBODY ELSE WHAT I'M SAYING

04:54:34.790 --> 04:54:37.593
IS IT'S TIME TO PRESS PAUSE.

04:54:37.659 --> 04:54:39.628
BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER FIGURE OUT

04:54:39.695 --> 04:54:41.463
HOW WE GET BACK TO WHAT THIS

04:54:41.530 --> 04:54:42.664
MOVEMENT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE.

04:54:42.731 --> 04:54:44.500
HOW WE CONTINUE TO SUPPORT OUR

04:54:44.566 --> 04:54:46.502
TRADITIONAL PUBLIC SCHOOLS WITH

04:54:46.568 --> 04:54:47.770
THE IDEAS THAT ARE IN KEEPING IN

04:54:47.836 --> 04:54:49.505
CHARTER SCHOOLS AND THAT WE

04:54:49.571 --> 04:54:51.073
DON'T DECIMATE?

04:54:51.140 --> 04:54:53.776
COMMUNITIES BY PULLING KIDS OUT

04:54:53.842 --> 04:54:55.244
THE BEST IN THE BRIGHTEST OUT OF

04:54:55.310 --> 04:54:56.445
OUR TRADITIONAL PUBLIC SCHOOLS

04:54:56.512 --> 04:54:57.479
AND SENDING THEM SOMEWHERE ELSE

04:54:57.546 --> 04:54:58.614
UNTIL THAT SCHOOL WANTS TO CLOSE

04:54:58.680 --> 04:55:00.015
DOWN OR CHANGE THE WAY THAT

04:55:00.082 --> 04:55:01.617
THEY'RE DOING THINGS.

04:55:01.683 --> 04:55:02.785
I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS THE

04:55:02.851 --> 04:55:04.486
ANSWER I DON'T.

04:55:04.553 --> 04:55:05.554
BUT I WANT ONE OF THESE BILLS TO

04:55:05.621 --> 04:55:07.022
MOVE FORWARD BECAUSE I'M HOPEFUL

04:55:07.089 --> 04:55:08.924
THAT THIS TASK FORCE WILL COME

04:55:08.991 --> 04:55:11.060
UP WITH REALLY GOOD IDEAS AND WE

04:55:11.126 --> 04:55:12.694
NEED A VEHICLE TO PUT THOSE

04:55:12.761 --> 04:55:14.696
IDEAS THAN. THIRTY SECONDS I

04:55:14.763 --> 04:55:16.432
HOPE TODAY THAT WE KEEP THIS

04:55:16.498 --> 04:55:18.434
DISCUSSION GOING BY PASSING ONE

04:55:18.500 --> 04:55:19.601
OF THESE BILLS.

04:55:19.668 --> 04:55:21.136
I'M CHARTER SCHOOL PARENT WHO

04:55:21.203 --> 04:55:22.771
WANTS TO BELIEVE IN THE FUTURE

04:55:22.838 --> 04:55:23.672
WE WILL HAVE CHARTER SCHOOLS

04:55:23.739 --> 04:55:25.174
THAT WORK HAND IN HAND WITH OUR

04:55:25.240 --> 04:55:26.842
TRADITIONAL PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN A

04:55:26.909 --> 04:55:28.410
VERY LIMITED WAY.

04:55:28.477 --> 04:55:29.711
THE CONTINUE AND THAT WILL

04:55:29.778 --> 04:55:31.280
PROTECT OUR TEACHERS AND I WANT

04:55:31.346 --> 04:55:32.347
TO BE ABLE TO TALK TO MY LOCAL

04:55:32.414 --> 04:55:33.749
SCHOOL BOARD ABOUT THAT.

04:55:33.816 --> 04:55:34.817
BECAUSE I GUARANTEE YOU NOBODY

04:55:34.883 --> 04:55:35.951
AT THE STATE BOARD.

04:55:36.018 --> 04:55:37.653
REALLY CARES WHAT I THINK ABOUT

04:55:37.719 --> 04:55:39.721
MY LOCAL CHARTER SCHOOL.

04:55:39.788 --> 04:55:41.657
I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR MY VOTE.

04:55:41.723 --> 04:55:43.058

MEMBERS WE ARE AT A CRISIS WE'RE

04:55:50.866 --> 04:55:53.268
IN A CRISIS IN EDUCATION SO

04:55:53.335 --> 04:55:55.204
TODAY'S DISCUSSION IN THIS BILL

04:55:55.270 --> 04:55:59.174
PERTAINS TO CHARTER SCHOOLS AND

04:55:59.241 --> 04:55:59.675
WITH.

04:55:59.741 --> 04:56:01.543
OUR PUBLIC EDUCATION BUT THERE

04:56:01.610 --> 04:56:03.112
ARE SO MANY CRISIS IS AN

04:56:03.178 --> 04:56:05.881
EDUCATION WE CAN ALL OF US STAND

04:56:05.948 --> 04:56:07.816
HERE ALL DAY LONG AND TALK ABOUT

04:56:07.883 --> 04:56:09.218
THE GOOD THINGS THE BAD THINGS

04:56:09.284 --> 04:56:11.386
AND REALLY THE DESTRUCTIVE

04:56:11.453 --> 04:56:12.421
THINGS.

04:56:12.488 --> 04:56:14.790
LAST NIGHT I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY

04:56:14.857 --> 04:56:16.959
TO SEE A DOCUMENTARY THAT WAS

04:56:17.025 --> 04:56:20.696
PUT ON BY THE FIRST PARTNER --

04:56:20.762 --> 04:56:21.763
JENNIFER.

04:56:21.830 --> 04:56:24.032
NEWSOM.

04:56:24.099 --> 04:56:25.033
THE GREAT AMERICAN LIE.

04:56:25.100 --> 04:56:27.503
AND THIS DOCUMENTARY FOCUSED UP

04:56:27.569 --> 04:56:29.004
IN ALL OAKLAND.

04:56:29.071 --> 04:56:31.206
AND IT SHOWED SOME PART OF

04:56:31.273 --> 04:56:33.275
PUBLIC SCHOOL JUNIOR HIGH

04:56:33.342 --> 04:56:34.776
STUDENTS AND WHAT THEY WERE

04:56:34.843 --> 04:56:37.079
GOING THROUGH EVERY SINGLE DAY --

04:56:37.146 --> 04:56:38.313
AND THAT WAS JUST ONE OF THE

04:56:38.380 --> 04:56:41.383
SCHOOLS BUT THE MESSAGES ARE

04:56:41.450 --> 04:56:43.652
FAILING STUDENTS AS A PUBLIC

04:56:43.719 --> 04:56:47.356
SCHOOL TEACHER MYSELF FOR THIRTY

04:56:47.422 --> 04:56:48.490
YEARS.

04:56:48.557 --> 04:56:50.192
I HAVE SEEN THE MOST BEAUTIFUL

04:56:50.259 --> 04:56:52.494
TEACHERS THAT ARE DEDICATED THAT

04:56:52.561 --> 04:56:54.630
IT YOU WOULD WANT YOUR CHILD TO

04:56:54.696 --> 04:56:55.998
HAVE WHO HAVE.

04:56:56.064 --> 04:56:58.367
DEVOTED THEIR TIME SPENT EXTRA

04:56:58.433 --> 04:57:00.836
HOURS ON THE WEEKENDS AND NIGHTS

04:57:00.903 --> 04:57:04.106
BUT I'VE ALSO SEEN THE SCHOOLS.

04:57:04.173 --> 04:57:07.242
PUBLIC SCHOOLS THAT OFFER EVEN

04:57:07.309 --> 04:57:09.711
SCHOOL CHOICE IN THEIR SCHOOLS

04:57:09.778 --> 04:57:11.580
PARENTS TAKE THEIR KIDS IN MY

04:57:11.647 --> 04:57:13.215
CITY TO WHAT WE CALL THE HILL

04:57:13.282 --> 04:57:15.117
SCHOOLS AND THE FLAT LAND

04:57:15.184 --> 04:57:17.786
SCHOOLS ARE HAVING LINES WITH

04:57:17.853 --> 04:57:19.555
PARENTS PULLING THEM OUT.

04:57:19.621 --> 04:57:21.823
AND THESE ARE PUBLIC SCHOOLS.

04:57:21.890 --> 04:57:23.292
AND SO WHAT WE CREATE EVEN IN

04:57:23.358 --> 04:57:25.460
OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS ARE THE HAVES

04:57:25.527 --> 04:57:27.596
AND THE HAVE NOTS THE PARENTS

04:57:27.663 --> 04:57:29.598
THAT CAN PROVIDE TRANSPORTATION

04:57:29.665 --> 04:57:31.600
HAVE ACCESS TO MOVE THEIR KIDS.

04:57:31.667 --> 04:57:33.669
THEY MOVE THEM AND WHAT HAPPENS

04:57:33.735 --> 04:57:36.004
IS MANY OF OUR TITLE ONE SCHOOLS

04:57:36.071 --> 04:57:37.172
ARE LEFT WITH THE LEAST

04:57:37.239 --> 04:57:39.942
QUALIFIED TEACHERS WITH PARENTS

04:57:40.008 --> 04:57:41.977
NOT BEING ABLE TO ADVOCATE AND

04:57:42.044 --> 04:57:43.645
THAT DOESN'T EVEN DISCUSS THE

04:57:43.712 --> 04:57:44.846
CHARTER SCHOOLS.

04:57:44.913 --> 04:57:46.782
AND AGAIN CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE

04:57:46.848 --> 04:57:48.984
INNOVATIVE THEY CAN BE VERY

04:57:49.051 --> 04:57:51.653
SUCCESSFUL IN SOME OF THE

04:57:51.720 --> 04:57:54.523
OPPOSITE SO WHERE ARE WE TODAY

04:57:54.590 --> 04:57:56.291
MAKING A DECISION ON ARE WE

04:57:56.358 --> 04:57:57.793
GOING TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THAT

04:57:57.859 --> 04:58:00.429
CONVERSATION OR WE GONNA STAND

04:58:00.495 --> 04:58:01.196
STILL.

04:58:01.263 --> 04:58:04.099
OR GO BACKWARDS AND TO BE HONEST

04:58:04.166 --> 04:58:06.134
ALL RIGHT TO THE AUTHOR.

04:58:06.201 --> 04:58:08.837
MADE A COMMITMENT LAST WEEK WHEN

04:58:08.904 --> 04:58:10.305
TALKING TO HIM.

04:58:10.372 --> 04:58:11.940
UP AND TO SEE T. A. WHICH IS AN

04:58:12.007 --> 04:58:13.609
ORGANIZATION I'VE BEEN INVOLVED

04:58:13.675 --> 04:58:16.278
WITH FOR THIRTY YEARS BUT I AM

04:58:16.345 --> 04:58:18.380
CONFLICTED IN SO TODAY I WILL

04:58:18.447 --> 04:58:20.716
GIVE MY VOTE. TO MOVE FORWARD

04:58:20.782 --> 04:58:23.051
BUT I URGE US TO CONTINUE THIS

04:58:23.118 --> 04:58:25.220
CRITICAL CONVERSATION BECAUSE WE

04:58:25.287 --> 04:58:28.357
ARE FAILING STUDENTS WE HAVE

04:58:28.423 --> 04:58:29.491
FOURTEEN HUNDRED EMPLOYEES AT

04:58:29.558 --> 04:58:31.960
THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION.

04:58:32.027 --> 04:58:33.929
I WANT TO KNOW I DON'T CARE

04:58:33.996 --> 04:58:36.331
ABOUT THE REPORTS IN THE LC FF I

04:58:36.398 --> 04:58:37.833
CARE ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN

04:58:37.899 --> 04:58:38.767
THE CLASSROOM BECAUSE I

04:58:38.834 --> 04:58:41.336
GUARANTEE YOU. FOR THIRTY YEARS

04:58:41.403 --> 04:58:42.938
OF TEACHING I SAT WHAT THE

04:58:43.005 --> 04:58:44.906
BETWEEN THIRTY AND THIRTY FIVE

04:58:44.973 --> 04:58:47.175
STUDENTS WITH NO EXTRA HELP NO

04:58:47.242 --> 04:58:48.910
MATTER HOW MUCH MONEY WE PUT

04:58:48.977 --> 04:58:50.646
INTO THE SCHOOLS MULTIPLE

04:58:50.712 --> 04:58:53.315
LANGUAGES SPECIAL ADD.

04:58:53.382 --> 04:58:55.717
IN MY CLASS WITH MAYBE A A

04:58:55.784 --> 04:58:58.020
SPECIAL ED TEACHER COMING IN FOR

04:58:58.086 --> 04:58:59.421
THIRTY MINUTES I HAD TO PUT UP A

04:58:59.488 --> 04:59:01.423
BOARD TO SHOW HOW MANY KIDS WERE

04:59:01.490 --> 04:59:05.394
COMING IN AND OUT IN AND OUT.

04:59:05.460 --> 04:59:07.129
BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE

04:59:07.195 --> 04:59:07.796
PROFESSIONALS THEY ARE TO BE IN

04:59:07.863 --> 04:59:09.398
THE CLASS WITH US THERE'S SO

04:59:09.464 --> 04:59:11.900
MUCH THAT I CAN SAY MEMBERS BUT

04:59:11.967 --> 04:59:13.302
WHETHER IT'S PUBLIC SCHOOL

04:59:13.368 --> 04:59:15.003
WHETHER IT'S CHARTER SCHOOLS WE

04:59:15.070 --> 04:59:17.205
HAVE TO BE BETTER WE CANNOT

04:59:17.272 --> 04:59:19.841
CONTINUE. TO PUT KIDS IN UP

04:59:19.908 --> 04:59:21.843
PLACES AND I DON'T CARE IF IT'S

04:59:21.910 --> 04:59:24.079
CHARTER OR PUBLIC WHERE THEY'RE

04:59:24.146 --> 04:59:25.147
NOT SUPPORTED.

04:59:25.213 --> 04:59:26.682
PARENTS ARE TRYING TO DO THEIR

04:59:26.748 --> 04:59:28.684
BEST BY WORKING JOBS AND THE

04:59:28.750 --> 04:59:30.886
LEAST THAT WE SHOULD EXPECT IS

04:59:30.952 --> 04:59:32.854
THAT OUR KIDS CAN GO TO SCHOOL

04:59:32.921 --> 04:59:35.090
AND A SAFE PLACE AND THAT THEY

04:59:35.157 --> 04:59:37.392
CAN LEARN.

04:59:37.459 --> 04:59:38.894
THAT'S WHAT EDUCATION ABOUT IT'S

04:59:38.960 --> 04:59:41.363
ABOUT LEARNING LEARNING TO WRITE

04:59:41.430 --> 04:59:43.365
TO READ A PLACE WHERE THEY CAN

04:59:43.432 --> 04:59:45.167
LEARN ABOUT LITERATURE AND

04:59:45.233 --> 04:59:47.102
HISTORY AND CHARACTERS AND WE

04:59:47.169 --> 04:59:49.638
POLITICIZE THIS AND WE HAVE.

04:59:49.705 --> 04:59:51.873
THIS WAR BETWEEN CHARTERS AND

04:59:51.940 --> 04:59:53.809
PUBLIC SCHOOL WE'RE MAKING IT

04:59:53.875 --> 04:59:56.511
WORSE SO TODAY I WILL SUPPORT

04:59:56.578 --> 04:59:58.113
THIS BILL.

04:59:58.180 --> 05:00:01.183
BUT WITH GREAT CONCERN AND I ASK

05:00:01.249 --> 05:00:03.652
OUR MEMBERS TO CONTINUE THIS

05:00:03.719 --> 05:00:06.121
DIALOGUE AND BRING THESE PEOPLE

05:00:06.188 --> 05:00:08.523
TOGETHER PARENTS TEACHERS AND

05:00:08.590 --> 05:00:10.459
LOCAL SCHOOL BOARDS BECAUSE

05:00:10.525 --> 05:00:11.993
UNLESS WE WORK TOGETHER WE

05:00:12.060 --> 05:00:14.029
CONTINUE THIS GREAT DIVIDE.

05:00:14.096 --> 05:00:15.497
AND THAT MOVIE LAST NIGHT

05:00:15.564 --> 05:00:19.134
DOCUMENTARY A GREAT LIFE I ASKED.

05:00:19.201 --> 05:00:20.736
I URGE YOU TO SEE IT BECAUSE IT

05:00:20.802 --> 05:00:22.738
TALKS ABOUT THE FOUNDATION OF

05:00:22.804 --> 05:00:27.109
OUR COUNTRY BEING TORN APART.

05:00:27.175 --> 05:00:28.510
THERE WAS QUIRK SILVA MS

05:00:28.577 --> 05:00:29.511
KAMLAGER-DOVE.

05:00:29.578 --> 05:00:31.780
YOU ARE RECOGNIZED.

05:00:31.847 --> 05:00:33.315
THANK YOU AYE AYE RISE.

05:00:33.382 --> 05:00:35.584
IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL I WILL

05:00:35.650 --> 05:00:37.052
BE SUPPORTING IT WITH

05:00:37.119 --> 05:00:39.621
TREPIDATION BUT ALSO WITH SOME

05:00:39.688 --> 05:00:41.256
FAITH AND HOPE.

05:00:41.323 --> 05:00:42.824
THAT WE WILL USE THE POLITICAL

05:00:42.891 --> 05:00:46.294
COURAGE AND ANGER THAT IS ON

05:00:46.361 --> 05:00:48.764
THIS FLOOR TO MAKE A COMMITMENT

05:00:48.830 --> 05:00:51.566
TO FIX OUR FAILING PUBLIC.

05:00:51.633 --> 05:00:54.903
SCHOOL EDUCATION SYSTEM.

05:00:54.970 --> 05:00:57.038
WE ARE POLITICIZING OUR KIDS AND

05:00:57.105 --> 05:00:59.775
WE ARE POLITICIZING THEIR FUTURE.

05:00:59.841 --> 05:01:02.110
BY DEMONIZING CHARTERS AND

05:01:02.177 --> 05:01:05.013
VICTIMIZING PUBLIC SCHOOLS.

05:01:05.080 --> 05:01:07.382
THERE ARE GOOD AND BAD ACTORS

05:01:07.449 --> 05:01:10.485
ACROSS THE SPECTRUM.

05:01:10.552 --> 05:01:11.586
WE SHOULD BE HAVING A

05:01:11.653 --> 05:01:14.523
CONVERSATION ABOUT FULLY FUNDING

05:01:14.589 --> 05:01:16.258
OUR PUBLIC SCHOOL EDUCATION

05:01:16.324 --> 05:01:19.995
ABOUT RETOOLING PROP.

05:01:20.061 --> 05:01:20.962
NINETY EIGHT ABOUT TALKING ABOUT

05:01:21.029 --> 05:01:22.998
THE FACT THAT MANY OF OUR SCHOOL

05:01:23.064 --> 05:01:25.667
DISTRICTS ARE LANDLORDS PROPERTY

05:01:25.734 --> 05:01:27.836
OWNERS WITH UNDER IN ROLLED

05:01:27.903 --> 05:01:28.770
SCHOOLS.

05:01:28.837 --> 05:01:30.338
BECAUSE PARENTS ARE USING THEIR

05:01:30.405 --> 05:01:32.374
CHOICE TO PUT THEIR KIDS

05:01:32.441 --> 05:01:34.276
SOMEPLACE ELSE.

05:01:34.342 --> 05:01:36.745
I'M A STEP MOTHER OF TWO KIDS IN

05:01:36.812 --> 05:01:38.980
A PUBLIC IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS I AM

05:01:39.047 --> 05:01:40.449
COMMITTED TO PUBLIC SCHOOLS.

05:01:40.515 --> 05:01:41.783
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT WHERE OUR

05:01:41.850 --> 05:01:43.051
KIDS ARE GOING TO GO WE'RE

05:01:43.118 --> 05:01:45.253
LOOKING AT THE TEACHERS AND

05:01:45.320 --> 05:01:46.822
WE'RE LOOKING AT THE SAFETY?

05:01:46.888 --> 05:01:48.423
ALL OF THOSE SCHOOLS WE'RE NOT

05:01:48.490 --> 05:01:50.625
LOOKING ABOUT THE CAFETERIA THE

05:01:50.692 --> 05:01:53.628
LANDSCAPING OR ANY OF THAT.

05:01:53.695 --> 05:01:54.996
AND WHEN THOSE TWO THINGS ARE IN

05:01:55.063 --> 05:01:57.132
FLUX ARE IN CRISIS WE HAVE A

05:01:57.199 --> 05:01:59.568
RESPONSIBILITY AND AN OBLIGATION

05:01:59.634 --> 05:02:02.237
TO FIND CHOICE SO THAT WE MAKE

05:02:02.304 --> 05:02:02.871
SURE THAT WE ARE PROTECTING OUR

05:02:02.938 --> 05:02:03.972
KIDS.

05:02:04.039 --> 05:02:05.974
SO WHY DON'T WE TALK ABOUT HOW

05:02:06.041 --> 05:02:07.375
WE'RE FUNDING OUR PUBLIC SCHOOL

05:02:07.442 --> 05:02:09.010
EDUCATION.

05:02:09.077 --> 05:02:11.480
WHY DON'T WE TALK ABOUT THE FACT

05:02:11.546 --> 05:02:13.381
THAT BECAUSE OF BUSING BECAUSE

05:02:13.448 --> 05:02:15.016
WHITE FOLKS TOOK THEIR KIDS OUT

05:02:15.083 --> 05:02:16.117
OF PUBLIC SCHOOLS BECAUSE WE

05:02:16.184 --> 05:02:18.086
PASSED PROP THIRTEEN THAT WE RE

05:02:18.153 --> 05:02:20.455
DIRECTED FUNDING AND COMMITMENT?

05:02:20.522 --> 05:02:22.424
AWAY FROM OUR PUBLIC SCHOOL

05:02:22.491 --> 05:02:24.426
SYSTEM WHY DON'T WE TALK ABOUT

05:02:24.493 --> 05:02:26.061
THAT.

05:02:26.127 --> 05:02:27.762
BECAUSE MOST FOLKS DON'T WANT TO

05:02:27.829 --> 05:02:30.365
WORK FIVE JOBS. TO AFFORD

05:02:30.432 --> 05:02:32.634
PRIVATE TUITION.

05:02:32.701 --> 05:02:34.603
BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE A PUBLIC

05:02:34.669 --> 05:02:35.237
SCHOOL IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD TO

05:02:35.303 --> 05:02:39.407
TAKE THEIR LET'S KEEP IT REAL.

05:02:39.474 --> 05:02:40.675
SO I'M VOTING TO MOVE THIS BILL

05:02:40.742 --> 05:02:42.744
FORWARD.

05:02:42.811 --> 05:02:44.813
BUT IN THAT VOTE IS A VOTE TO

05:02:44.880 --> 05:02:46.515
REALLY TALK ABOUT WHAT WE WANT

05:02:46.581 --> 05:02:48.049
FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND

05:02:48.116 --> 05:02:50.218
FOR OUR KIDS RICH KIDS POOR KIDS

05:02:50.285 --> 05:02:51.486
MIDDLE CLASS KIDS WHO ALL

05:02:51.553 --> 05:02:53.955
DESERVE THE RIGHT. TO BE ABLE TO

05:02:54.022 --> 05:02:55.657
TAKE THEIR CHILD TO A PUBLIC

05:02:55.724 --> 05:02:58.727
SCHOOL IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD AND

05:02:58.793 --> 05:03:00.228
AND KNOW THAT THEIR CHILD WILL

05:03:00.295 --> 05:03:06.735
BE SAFE.

05:03:06.801 --> 05:03:09.738
MS MELENDEZ YOUR RECOGNIZE.

05:03:09.804 --> 05:03:11.239
THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I KNOW

05:03:11.306 --> 05:03:12.974
WE HAVE A A WHOLE PACKAGE OF

05:03:13.041 --> 05:03:14.643
BILLS COMING FORWARD TO ADDRESS

05:03:14.709 --> 05:03:16.144
CHARTER SCHOOLS AND WE HAD.

05:03:16.211 --> 05:03:18.513
A LOT OF PERSONAL CONVERSATIONS

05:03:18.580 --> 05:03:20.015
ON THIS FLOOR ABOUT HOW CHARTER

05:03:20.081 --> 05:03:22.951
SCHOOLS HAVE AFFECTED --

05:03:23.018 --> 05:03:24.519
SOMEONE'S LIFE HOW PUBLIC

05:03:24.586 --> 05:03:25.787
SCHOOLS HAVE AFFECTED SOMEONE'S

05:03:25.854 --> 05:03:27.689
LIFE AND THAT'S GREAT BECAUSE

05:03:27.756 --> 05:03:28.690
THERE'S ROOM FOR ALL

05:03:28.757 --> 05:03:28.990
[inaudible]

05:03:29.057 --> 05:03:32.360
BUT LET'S REMEMBER THE FACT THAT

05:03:32.427 --> 05:03:34.529
THERE ARE.

05:03:34.596 --> 05:03:37.198
IT'S NOT A ONE SIZE FITS ALL.

05:03:37.265 --> 05:03:38.133
AND I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MANY

05:03:38.199 --> 05:03:40.135
EMAILS I'VE RECEIVED AND I KNOW

05:03:40.201 --> 05:03:41.469
YOU RECEIVE THEM.

05:03:41.536 --> 05:03:42.971
TO ABOUT PARENTS WHO SAY THE

05:03:43.038 --> 05:03:44.239
PUBLIC SCHOOL IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD

05:03:44.306 --> 05:03:45.607
WASN'T THE RIGHT FIT FOR MY

05:03:45.674 --> 05:03:46.708
CHILD.

05:03:46.775 --> 05:03:48.543
OR THE PUBLIC SCOOL IN MY

05:03:48.610 --> 05:03:51.012
NEIGHBORHOOD WAS FAILING.

05:03:51.079 --> 05:03:53.381
THE KIDS WHO ATTEND THERE.

05:03:53.448 --> 05:03:55.050
WE HAVE A MORE THAN HALF OF

05:03:55.116 --> 05:03:56.818
AFRICAN AMERICAN YOUNG BOYS YOU

05:03:56.885 --> 05:03:58.687
DON'T READ AT GRADE LEVEL IN

05:03:58.753 --> 05:04:03.058
pTHAT IS A FAILURE.

05:04:03.124 --> 05:04:04.726
WE HEARD THE CONVERSATION

05:04:04.793 --> 05:04:06.528
EARLIER ABOUT WHERE CALIFORNIA

05:04:06.595 --> 05:04:08.763
RANKS WITH RESPECT TO EDUCATION

05:04:08.830 --> 05:04:10.298
OUR LEVEL OF SUCCESS.

05:04:10.365 --> 05:04:12.233
THIS FUNDING HAS GONE LIKE THIS

05:04:12.300 --> 05:04:13.568
IF YOU LOOK AT THE GRAPH FUNDING

05:04:13.635 --> 05:04:15.370
IS GONE UP THE LEAD LOOKS OF

05:04:15.437 --> 05:04:19.941
SUCCESS HIS PAID FLAT.

05:04:20.008 --> 05:04:21.977
THAT'S NOT SUCCESS IN MY EYES I

05:04:22.043 --> 05:04:25.180
DON'T THINK IT IS YOURS EITHER.

05:04:25.246 --> 05:04:28.850
BUT TO DENY PARENTS AND CHILDREN.

05:04:28.917 --> 05:04:31.086
THE OPTION TO PUT THEIR CHILD IN

05:04:31.152 --> 05:04:33.188
A SCHOOL THAT BEST SUITS THEM

05:04:33.254 --> 05:04:34.623
WHETHER IT'S THEIR ACADEMIC

05:04:34.689 --> 05:04:35.924
NEEDS WHETHER IT'S THEIR

05:04:35.991 --> 05:04:38.493
BEHAVIORAL NEEDS.

05:04:38.560 --> 05:04:40.562
IT'S NOT OUR PLACE TO TO STAND

05:04:40.629 --> 05:04:42.163
BETWEEN THE PARENT AND CHILD AND

05:04:42.230 --> 05:04:43.131
THEIR EDUCATION BECAUSE YOU ONLY

05:04:43.198 --> 05:04:45.300
GET TO DO IT ONCE THERE'S NO

05:04:45.367 --> 05:04:46.234
GOING BACK.

05:04:46.301 --> 05:04:47.969
THERE NO DO OCCURS SO I DON'T

05:04:48.036 --> 05:04:49.838
KNOW WHY WE HAVE TO HAVE THIS

05:04:49.904 --> 05:04:51.706
BATTLE BETWEEN THE PUBLIC

05:04:51.773 --> 05:04:53.274
SCHOOLS IN THE CHARTER SCHOOLS.

05:04:53.341 --> 05:04:55.477
I I UNDERSTAND THE POLITICAL

05:04:55.543 --> 05:04:57.245
SIDE OF IT BUT FROM A PARENT'S

05:04:57.312 --> 05:04:58.713
PERSPECTIVE MY GOODNESS ARE SO

05:04:58.780 --> 05:05:00.048
MANY PEOPLE IN HERE.

05:05:00.115 --> 05:05:02.017
WHO ARE PARENTS MANY OF YOU NOW

05:05:02.083 --> 05:05:03.518
THANKFULLY IT'S A DIFFERENT

05:05:03.585 --> 05:05:04.853
LEGISLATURE IN THE MAKE UP IS

05:05:04.919 --> 05:05:07.522
YOUNGER AND YOU HAVE YOUNG KIDS

05:05:07.589 --> 05:05:10.091
AND WE HAD KIDS STILL IN SCHOOL?

05:05:10.158 --> 05:05:10.992
SO.

05:05:11.059 --> 05:05:12.594
I WOULD THINK THIS IS VERY

05:05:12.661 --> 05:05:14.262
PRESSING ON YOUR MIND.

05:05:14.329 --> 05:05:15.397
THE FACT THAT THIS THAT THE

05:05:15.463 --> 05:05:17.465
EDUCATION YOUR KIDS ARE ABLE TO

05:05:17.532 --> 05:05:19.367
GET OR NOT ABLE TO GET.

05:05:19.434 --> 05:05:20.502
IT'S SOMETHING YOU ONLY GET TO

05:05:20.568 --> 05:05:22.604
DO ONCE.

05:05:22.671 --> 05:05:24.606
THIS IS NOT A BATTLE BETWEEN

05:05:24.673 --> 05:05:26.207
PUBLIC SCHOOL IN CHARTER SCHOOL

05:05:26.274 --> 05:05:27.509
THIS IS A BATTLE FOR YOUR KIDS

05:05:27.575 --> 05:05:29.944
EDUCATION.

05:05:30.011 --> 05:05:35.717

I THINK IT WAS SPEAKER MEMBERS --

05:05:41.156 --> 05:05:42.524
I ALSO DID NOT PLAN TO SPEAK ON

05:05:42.590 --> 05:05:44.893
THIS BILL TODAY BUT MOSTLY

05:05:44.959 --> 05:05:45.493
BECAUSE I DID KNOW WAS ECONOMY

05:05:45.560 --> 05:05:47.796

05:05:47.862 --> 05:05:49.297
DO ALSO TAKE OFFENSE TO IT A

05:05:49.364 --> 05:05:50.532
COMING UP AT THE VERY LAST

05:05:50.598 --> 05:05:52.100
MINUTE WHEN PEOPLE AREN'T QUITE

05:05:52.167 --> 05:05:53.668
SURE AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN

05:05:53.735 --> 05:05:54.803
HERE IT IS.

05:05:54.869 --> 05:05:56.805
AND LIKE ALL OF YOU I HAVE GOOD

05:05:56.871 --> 05:05:57.472
CHARTERS AND I HAVE NOT SO GOOD

05:05:57.539 --> 05:05:58.907
CHARTERS.

05:05:58.973 --> 05:06:00.442
AND I ALSO LIVE WHERE I

05:06:00.508 --> 05:06:02.577
PERSONALLY LIVE IN MY DISTRICT

05:06:02.644 --> 05:06:04.212
IS A HIGH POVERTY AREA.

05:06:04.279 --> 05:06:05.547
IT IS ONE OF THE HIGHEST POVERTY

05:06:05.613 --> 05:06:08.216
AREAS IN MY CITY.

05:06:08.283 --> 05:06:11.953
AND ITS PEOPLE KNOW WHEN I MOVED%

05:06:12.020 --> 05:06:12.520
THERE I DIDN'T HAVE A CHILD

05:06:12.587 --> 05:06:12.821
[inaudible]

05:06:12.887 --> 05:06:15.056
AND NGUYEN KINDERGARTEN BEGAN

05:06:15.123 --> 05:06:16.524
ALL OF A SUDDEN I HAD A CHILD

05:06:16.591 --> 05:06:17.525
AND SO I HAD TO MAKE SOME

05:06:17.592 --> 05:06:18.760
DECISIONS ABOUT WHAT I WAS GONNA

05:06:18.827 --> 05:06:20.295
DO I AM A PRODUCT OF PUBLIC

05:06:20.361 --> 05:06:21.296
EDUCATION.

05:06:21.362 --> 05:06:23.598
K. THROUGH TWELVE ALL THE WAY UP

05:06:23.665 --> 05:06:24.466
TO PHD ARE GOING TO PUBLIC

05:06:24.532 --> 05:06:26.534
SCHOOLS AND I'M A GIANT

05:06:26.601 --> 05:06:29.671
SUPPORTER IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS --

05:06:29.738 --> 05:06:32.173
NGUYEN AND I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO

05:06:32.240 --> 05:06:33.975
GET MY CHILD INTO A MAGNET.

05:06:34.042 --> 05:06:35.210
THAT IS VERY CLOSE TO MY HOUSE

05:06:35.276 --> 05:06:36.845
THAT IS A MAGNET AT ANOTHER

05:06:36.911 --> 05:06:38.613
PUBLIC SCHOOL.

05:06:38.680 --> 05:06:40.148
SHE'S NOW GRADUATING WITH A

05:06:40.215 --> 05:06:41.382
CAUGHT NOW PROMOTING A FIFTH

05:06:41.449 --> 05:06:42.884
GRADE.

05:06:42.951 --> 05:06:44.919
HER NEXT STEP IS TO FOR HER TO

05:06:44.986 --> 05:06:46.454
CONTINUE IN THAT MAGNET.

05:06:46.521 --> 05:06:47.789
SHE'S A TEN YEAR OLD IS A CENTER

05:06:47.856 --> 05:06:49.157
TO A COMPREHENSIVE HIGH SCHOOL

05:06:49.224 --> 05:06:50.425
ACROSS TOWN.

05:06:50.492 --> 05:06:51.960
BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THE MIDDLE

05:06:52.026 --> 05:06:54.596
YEARS ACADEMY AS THAT DOESN'T

05:06:54.662 --> 05:06:55.663
FEEL LIKE A GOOD OPTION TO ME.

05:06:55.730 --> 05:06:57.766
MY TO PUBLIC SCHOOLS WITHIN IN

05:06:57.832 --> 05:06:59.667
MY AREA.

05:06:59.734 --> 05:07:01.202
HAVE SOME OF THE LOWEST TEST

05:07:01.269 --> 05:07:03.004
SCORES IN THE COUNTY.

05:07:03.071 --> 05:07:03.972
I DON'T THINK THAT'S AN OPTION

05:07:04.038 --> 05:07:05.707
FOR ME.

05:07:05.774 --> 05:07:07.308
SO I THEN AM BASED WIT THE

05:07:07.375 --> 05:07:08.510
ISSUE DO I SEND MY KID TO A

05:07:08.576 --> 05:07:09.778
PRIVATE SCHOOL DO I SEND MY KID

05:07:09.844 --> 05:07:12.847
TO A PAROCHIAL DO I SEND MY KID

05:07:12.914 --> 05:07:14.482
TO A CHARTER.

05:07:14.549 --> 05:07:15.016
AND NONE OF THOSE ARE EASY

05:07:15.083 --> 05:07:17.485
DECISIONS.

05:07:17.552 --> 05:07:18.953
I WANT LIKE EVERYBODY WANTS

05:07:19.020 --> 05:07:20.455
EVERY PUBLIC SCHOOL WE HAVE TO

05:07:20.522 --> 05:07:22.056
BE FULLY FUNDED SO WE DON'T HAVE

05:07:22.123 --> 05:07:23.792
TO HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS.

05:07:23.858 --> 05:07:24.859
BUT THE KID SHOULDN'T BE THE

05:07:24.926 --> 05:07:26.261
ONES PUT IN THE MIDDLE AND THE

05:07:26.327 --> 05:07:27.562
PARENTS SHOULDN'T BE THE ONE TO

05:07:27.629 --> 05:07:28.563
PUT IN THE MIDDLE.

05:07:28.630 --> 05:07:29.764
LIVING AN INCREDIBLY DIVERSE

05:07:29.831 --> 05:07:31.132
PLACE I CAN TELL YOU UNLIKE

05:07:31.199 --> 05:07:32.500

CHARTER SCHOOL THAT I GO AND SEE

05:07:34.068 --> 05:07:35.937

05:07:36.004 --> 05:07:37.539
BROWN AND BLACK KIDS.

05:07:37.605 --> 05:07:39.507
WHO ARE WHO ARE THERE ATTENDING

05:07:39.574 --> 05:07:41.042
AND MANY DOING VERY WELL?

05:07:41.109 --> 05:07:42.877
MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO I

05:07:42.944 --> 05:07:44.479
ECHO THE THE THAT WE'RE NOT

05:07:44.546 --> 05:07:46.147
TALKING ABOUT THE QUALITY OF THE

05:07:46.214 --> 05:07:48.149
SCHOOLS WERE NOT TALKING A

05:07:48.216 --> 05:07:49.818
STUDENT OUTCOMES.

05:07:49.884 --> 05:07:51.019
I AM ALSO PREPARE FOR THIS

05:07:51.085 --> 05:07:52.787
CONVERSATION GO FORWARD BUT I

05:07:52.854 --> 05:07:54.689
WOULD LIKE SOME REAL I ALSO

05:07:54.756 --> 05:07:56.291

FOR DATA WE'VE GOT TASK FORCE

05:07:57.458 --> 05:07:59.360
GOING ON FOR US TO BE.

05:07:59.427 --> 05:08:00.428
DOING THIS VERY QUICKLY COULD

05:08:00.495 --> 05:08:01.663
PUT AN URGENCY CLOSET DO THIS

05:08:01.729 --> 05:08:02.697
LATER.

05:08:02.764 --> 05:08:04.999
IS ALSO A LITTLE.

05:08:05.066 --> 05:08:06.067
DISINGENUOUS.

05:08:06.134 --> 05:08:07.135
BUT I THINK THE CONVERSATION

05:08:07.202 --> 05:08:08.269
SHOULD CONTINUE AND I WANT TO

05:08:08.336 --> 05:08:10.338

05:08:10.405 --> 05:08:11.039
AND IF YOU'RE GONNA TAKE

05:08:11.105 --> 05:08:12.006

MEANS GOT TO COME BACK HERE FOR

05:08:13.241 --> 05:08:14.142
CONCURRENCE.

05:08:14.209 --> 05:08:16.511
I THINK WE ALL WANT AN APPEAL

05:08:16.578 --> 05:08:18.646
PROCESS THAT IS FAIR.

05:08:18.713 --> 05:08:20.014
I ALSO HAVE A DISTRICT THAT HAS

05:08:20.081 --> 05:08:21.249

LET ALONE THE COUNTY.

05:08:27.956 --> 05:08:28.857
