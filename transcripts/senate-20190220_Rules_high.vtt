I THINK MY FINAL AREA OF

QUESTIONING YOU HAVE OVERSIGHT

00:09:04.477 --> 00:09:06.812

00:09:08.714 --> 00:09:10.616
YESTERDAY THAT MANY OF THOSE.

00:09:10.683 --> 00:09:12.752
CANDACE PROGRAMS ARE WITHIN

00:09:12.818 --> 00:09:17.023
CONSOLIDATED UNDER DIFFERENT --

00:09:17.089 --> 00:09:18.357
ADMINISTRATIVE.

00:09:18.424 --> 00:09:20.559
COMBINATIONS ONE OF THE AREAS

00:09:20.626 --> 00:09:21.727
THAT WE TALKED ABOUT.

00:09:21.794 --> 00:09:24.530
IS THE CURRENT PROGRESS

00:09:24.597 --> 00:09:25.765
CONSCIOUS IN THE INFECTIOUS

00:09:25.831 --> 00:09:28.167
DISEASE SECTOR PARTICULARLY

00:09:28.234 --> 00:09:30.436
UPTAKE OF VACCINATIONS IN

00:09:30.503 --> 00:09:33.773
SCHOOLS COULD YOU PROVIDE US A

00:09:33.839 --> 00:09:35.608
CURRENT UPDATE OF BOTH PROGRESS

00:09:35.675 --> 00:09:37.510
AND CONTINUED CHALLENGES SURE SO

00:09:37.576 --> 00:09:39.779
WITH THE PASSAGE OF SB TWO

00:09:39.845 --> 00:09:41.247
SEVENTY SEVEN WHICH ELIMINATED

00:09:41.314 --> 00:09:42.682
THE PERSONAL BELIEF EXEMPTION WE

00:09:42.748 --> 00:09:43.849
WORKED REALLY HARD.

00:09:43.916 --> 00:09:46.385
ACROSS THE STATE TO EDUCATE AND

00:09:46.452 --> 00:09:48.220
TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ON THE ON

00:09:48.287 --> 00:09:49.188
HEALTH THAT LOG WE SHOULD BE

00:09:49.255 --> 00:09:51.057
IMPLEMENTED AND WE REALLY STILL

00:09:51.123 --> 00:09:52.758
AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF

00:09:52.825 --> 00:09:54.694
VACCINATION THROUGHOUT THE STATE.

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:55.261
AND THAT.

00:09:55.328 --> 00:09:56.796
REALLY WAS A PROTECTIVE FACTOR

00:09:56.862 --> 00:09:59.031
AND NOW I'M ONLY RECENTLY WE'VE

00:09:59.098 --> 00:10:00.533
SEEN AN UPTICK IN MEDICAL

00:10:00.599 --> 00:10:02.068
EXEMPTIONS AND SO WE'RE

00:10:02.134 --> 00:10:03.703
CONCERNED ABOUT THAT BECAUSE

00:10:03.769 --> 00:10:04.770
ALTHOUGH.

00:10:04.837 --> 00:10:06.639
IT'S A SMALL UP TAKE A BIT DOES

00:10:06.706 --> 00:10:08.374
OCCUR IN SOME SCHOOLS WHERE IT

00:10:08.441 --> 00:10:09.942
LEAVES A LARGE NUMBER OF

00:10:10.009 --> 00:10:11.544
UNVACCINATED CHILDREN AND SO

00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:12.678
LOOKING FOR THE PUBLIC HEALTH

00:10:12.745 --> 00:10:14.380
RISK OF THAT WE WANT TO IDENTIFY

00:10:14.447 --> 00:10:15.548
THOSE SCHOOLS WHERE.

00:10:15.614 --> 00:10:16.983
THE VACCINATION RATE IS UNDER

00:10:17.049 --> 00:10:19.485
THE 95% WHICH WE THINK IS SORT

00:10:19.552 --> 00:10:21.320
OF WHAT YOU NEED TO PROTECT THE

00:10:21.387 --> 00:10:23.689
POPULATION AND SO BECAUSE SOME

00:10:23.756 --> 00:10:26.292
SCHOOLS AND DO YOU HAVE A LARGE

00:10:26.359 --> 00:10:28.094
NUMBER OF UNVACCINATED CHILDREN.

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:29.795
WE ARE COLLECTING DATA THAT THEY

00:10:29.862 --> 00:10:30.997
HAVE TO REPORT EACH SCHOOL IS

00:10:31.063 --> 00:10:32.765
REQUIRED TO REPORT ON THEIR

00:10:32.832 --> 00:10:34.533
VACCINATION RATE AND WILL BE

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:36.335
LOOKING OUT OF SCHOOLS WHERE

00:10:36.402 --> 00:10:37.269
THEY HAVE A LOWER VACCINATION

00:10:37.336 --> 00:10:38.838
RATE COLLECTING THE MEDICAL

00:10:38.904 --> 00:10:40.072
EXEMPTIONS.

00:10:40.139 --> 00:10:41.841
AND LOOKING AT WHETHER THERE ARE

00:10:41.907 --> 00:10:44.477
PARTICULAR LOCATIONS ARE DOCTORS

00:10:44.543 --> 00:10:45.878
THAT MIGHT BE.

00:10:45.945 --> 00:10:47.513
IN NEED OF SOME SPECIAL

00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:49.315
EDUCATION OR SOME --

00:10:49.382 --> 00:10:53.252
MOVE THE M. FURTHER INFORMATION

00:10:53.319 --> 00:10:56.155
FROM SEE IN THE NEED FOR

00:10:56.222 --> 00:10:57.556
VACCINATION AND IN THE EVENT

00:10:57.623 --> 00:10:59.325
THAT THERE ARE BAD ACTORS THAN

00:10:59.392 --> 00:11:01.060
WE CAN TAKE OTHER ACTIONS.

00:11:01.127 --> 00:11:02.895
IN OUR THEIR STANDARDS OR

00:11:02.962 --> 00:11:06.098
CRITERIA. FOR FOR DOCTORS TO BE

00:11:06.165 --> 00:11:08.501
ABLE TO ANA --

00:11:08.567 --> 00:11:10.903
SIGN IN A MEDICAL EXEMPTION

00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:12.638
THERE ARE THE STATUTE IS IS

00:11:12.705 --> 00:11:14.540
SPECIFIC ABOUT SPECIFIC

00:11:14.607 --> 00:11:15.875
REQUIREMENTS THAT THEY NEED TO

00:11:15.941 --> 00:11:17.610
MEET IN ORDER --

00:11:17.676 --> 00:11:18.677
TO MEET THE MEDICAL DEFINITION

00:11:18.744 --> 00:11:20.312
IT WOULD BE UNDER THE PURVIEW OF

00:11:20.379 --> 00:11:22.715
THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH.

00:11:22.782 --> 00:11:24.583
TO PERIODICALLY REVIEW THE

00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:26.519
ISSUANCE OF THOSE MEDICAL

00:11:26.585 --> 00:11:27.953
EXEMPTIONS.

00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:30.289
IF WE WOULD GO THROUGH THE

00:11:30.356 --> 00:11:30.890

00:11:30.956 --> 00:11:31.257
DON'T.

00:11:31.323 --> 00:11:32.792
LOOK AT ALL OF THEM BUT WHAT WE

00:11:32.858 --> 00:11:34.093
WOULD LOOK AT IS THE PUBLIC

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:36.028
HEALTH RISKS SO WHERE WE BELIEVE

00:11:36.095 --> 00:11:37.797
THE VACCINATION RATE IS LOW

00:11:37.863 --> 00:11:39.131
ENOUGH THAT IT PRESENTS A PUBLIC

00:11:39.198 --> 00:11:40.900
HEALTH RISK WE WOULD LOOK AT IT

00:11:40.966 --> 00:11:42.201
FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE WE WHEN.

00:11:42.268 --> 00:11:43.602
WE'RE NOT THE MEDICAL BOARD

00:11:43.669 --> 00:11:45.304

BECAUSE WE THINK THEY HAVE GOOD

00:16:34.526 --> 00:16:37.129
IDEAS AND LEARNING I'M ON THE

00:16:37.196 --> 00:16:38.997
RESOURCES THEY NEED TO CONDUCT A

00:16:39.064 --> 00:16:41.400

SECOND YEAR OF A FIVE YEAR SORT

00:16:49.141 --> 00:16:50.376

00:16:50.442 --> 00:16:51.910
THAT WE WILL WE HAVE AN OVERALL

00:16:51.977 --> 00:16:53.512
EVALUATION STRATEGY SO THAT

00:16:53.579 --> 00:16:54.780
EVERYBODY.

00:16:54.847 --> 00:16:55.981
REGARDLESS OF THE TYPE OF

00:16:56.048 --> 00:16:57.249
PROGRAM THAT THEY'RE RUNNING THE

00:16:57.316 --> 00:16:58.550
EVERYBODY WILL COLLECT SOME

00:16:58.617 --> 00:17:00.319
STANDARD DATA SO THAT WE CAN SEE

00:17:00.386 --> 00:17:01.920
WHAT WORKS AND WHY IT WORKS.

00:17:01.987 --> 00:17:04.289
AND I THINK THAT'S A BIG EFFORT

00:17:04.356 --> 00:17:05.491
THAT WERE UNDER WAY ON THE

00:17:05.557 --> 00:17:07.393
MENTAL HEALTH SIDE MANY OF OUR

00:17:07.459 --> 00:17:09.528
PROGRAMS AND IN OUR MATERNAL AND

00:17:09.595 --> 00:17:10.596
CHILD.

00:17:10.662 --> 00:17:12.030

ADDRESS MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES

00:17:13.565 --> 00:17:15.768
SO OUR HOME VISITING PROGRAM

00:17:15.834 --> 00:17:17.169
PART OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO

00:17:17.236 --> 00:17:18.537
TO IMPROVE OUTCOMES OF MOTHERS

00:17:18.604 --> 00:17:20.606
AND BABIES IS REALLY TO LOOK AT

00:17:20.672 --> 00:17:22.808
NOT JUST HEALTH CARE AND ACCESS

00:17:22.875 --> 00:17:23.909
TO HEALTH CARE ABOUT THOSE.

00:17:23.976 --> 00:17:25.277
COMMUNITY LINKAGES THAT CAN

00:17:25.344 --> 00:17:26.779

REALLY BUILD THE AND OUR

00:17:34.319 --> 00:17:36.054

ARE.

00:17:36.488 --> 00:17:37.790

COLLECTIVE IMPACT AROUND THOSE

00:17:56.308 --> 00:17:57.142

THE ISSUES A LIKE YOUR QUESTIONS

00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:36.375
WHICH ACTUALLY US COURSES I

00:19:44.550 --> 00:19:46.351
VACCINATION --

00:19:46.418 --> 00:19:47.886
I'D ADD THOUGH I HAVE A HUNDRED

00:19:47.953 --> 00:19:49.922
WE HAD THE WHOLE SB TWO SEVEN

00:19:49.988 --> 00:19:51.657
SEVEN I HAVE MET WITH FAMILIES.

00:19:51.723 --> 00:19:53.625

00:19:57.396 --> 00:20:01.667
KNOW EXIST WHEN I'M CURIOUS ON

00:20:01.733 --> 00:20:03.468
THE DATA THOUGH.

00:20:03.535 --> 00:20:04.903
B. E. THINK IT'S PEOPLE ARE

00:20:04.970 --> 00:20:05.504
AVOIDING IT OR DO YOU THINK.

00:20:05.571 --> 00:20:06.538
PEOPLE CAN'T FIND THE

00:20:06.605 --> 00:20:08.740
DOCUMENTATION SO WISHES EASIER

00:20:08.807 --> 00:20:10.409
ASK FOR MEDICAL EXEMPTION AND

00:20:10.475 --> 00:20:12.110
THEN MAYBE THOSE VACCINATION

00:20:12.177 --> 00:20:13.579
RATES ARE OF THAT ARE HIGHER

00:20:13.645 --> 00:20:14.947
THAN WHAT WE THINK.

00:20:15.013 --> 00:20:16.582
THIS I'M JUST CURIOUS I'M I'M I

00:20:16.648 --> 00:20:17.816
DON'T HAVE THE EXACT DATE --

00:20:17.883 --> 00:20:18.817
BUT I DO THINK THERE ARE PEOPLE

00:20:18.884 --> 00:20:20.719
WHO ARE INSTEAD OF USING A

00:20:20.786 --> 00:20:22.287
PERSONAL BELIEF EXEMPTION ARE

00:20:22.354 --> 00:20:23.322
LOOKING TO GET A MEDICAL

00:20:23.388 --> 00:20:25.557
EXEMPTION BECAUSE THEY DON'T

00:20:25.624 --> 00:20:26.825
WANT THE VACCINATION --

00:20:26.892 --> 00:20:28.460
BUT I THINK THERE ARE ALSO

00:20:28.527 --> 00:20:30.696
PEOPLE WHO GENERALLY GENUINELY

00:20:30.762 --> 00:20:32.331
NEED FOR MEDICAL EXEMPTION AND

00:20:32.397 --> 00:20:33.999
SO THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS WE

00:20:34.066 --> 00:20:35.534
WANT TO LOOK AT AS WERE

00:20:35.601 --> 00:20:37.369
COLLECTING THAT DATA BECAUSE ON

00:20:37.436 --> 00:20:39.237
THE EXEMPTION IT WILL LIST WHY

00:20:39.304 --> 00:20:40.672
THEY'VE GRANTED FOR A MEDICAL

00:20:40.739 --> 00:20:45.010
EXEMPTION AND I THINK WE WANT TO

00:20:45.077 --> 00:20:45.210
TAKE.

00:20:45.277 --> 00:20:46.345
A LOOK AT THAT.

00:20:46.411 --> 00:20:47.446
RIGHT LOGIN CONGRATULATIONS

THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR VICE

00:20:50.449 --> 00:20:51.149
CHAIRMAN --

00:20:51.216 --> 00:20:52.818
ADD TO FOLLOW ALONG ON THE

00:20:52.884 --> 00:20:54.019
HEPATITIS A OUTBREAK IN SAN

00:20:54.086 --> 00:20:55.253
DIEGO.

00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:56.688
THAT THEN LTIMATELY THERE WERE

00:20:56.755 --> 00:20:58.957
CASES AND SANTA CRUZ IN LOS

00:20:59.024 --> 00:20:59.424
ANGELES.

00:20:59.491 --> 00:21:03.695
I WANT TO UNDERSTAND --

00:21:03.762 --> 00:21:05.197
AND I UNDERSTAND THE COUNTIES

00:21:05.263 --> 00:21:07.899
HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO DECLARE

00:21:07.966 --> 00:21:09.901
AN EMERGENCY THERE ARE ACTIONS

00:21:09.968 --> 00:21:12.771
THAT NEED TO BE TAKEN --

00:21:12.838 --> 00:21:15.107
HOWEVER THIS WAS A VERY LONG

00:21:15.173 --> 00:21:16.541
PERIOD OF TIME IN WHICH THERE

00:21:16.608 --> 00:21:18.443
WAS INACTION THERE WAS AN AUDIT

00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:20.512
I THINK WE GOT TO READ THAT BUT

00:21:20.579 --> 00:21:21.713
MY CONCERN.

00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:22.614
IS THAT I KIND OF WANT TO

00:21:22.681 --> 00:21:24.449
UNDERSTAND WINDOWS THE

00:21:24.516 --> 00:21:26.151
DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH STEP

00:21:26.218 --> 00:21:28.987
IN WHEN I COUNTY IS NOT DOING

00:21:29.054 --> 00:21:30.555
WHAT IT NEEDS TO DO.

00:21:30.622 --> 00:21:32.891
THIS WAS A LONG PERIOD OF MONTHS

00:21:32.958 --> 00:21:34.426
I EVEN MADE A CALL TO THE

00:21:34.493 --> 00:21:35.827
GOVERNOR'S OFFICE --

00:21:35.894 --> 00:21:37.396
AS THOSE NUMBERS STARTED TO

00:21:37.462 --> 00:21:40.732
INCREASE FROM IN THE FIVE

00:21:40.799 --> 00:21:42.634
HUNDRED EIGHTY SEVEN CASES AND

00:21:42.701 --> 00:21:43.468
FOUR HUNDRED TO HOSPITALIZATION

00:21:43.535 --> 00:21:45.537
SO MY WORRY.

00:21:45.604 --> 00:21:49.074
IS AT WHAT POINT I IT HOW DO YOU

00:21:49.141 --> 00:21:51.910
MONITOR A COUNTIES RESPONSE WHEN

00:21:51.977 --> 00:21:53.712
YOU BECOME AWARE OF THE PENDING

00:21:53.779 --> 00:21:55.580
SITUATION --

00:21:55.647 --> 00:21:57.549
AND THERE IS NOT THE MOST

00:21:57.616 --> 00:21:59.251
RESPONSIBLE ACTION TAKEN ON THE

00:21:59.317 --> 00:22:01.386
PART OF THE COUNTY OR

00:22:01.453 --> 00:22:03.655
JURISDICTION.

00:22:03.722 --> 00:22:05.223
AS SOON A I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

00:22:05.290 --> 00:22:07.025
TO RECOGNIZE THAT IN SAN DIEGO%

00:22:07.092 --> 00:22:08.727
COUNTY WE WERE WORKING WITH THE

00:22:08.794 --> 00:22:10.962
LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTION DAILY --

00:22:11.029 --> 00:22:12.698
THROUGHOUT PROBABLY MOST OF THAT

00:22:12.764 --> 00:22:15.033
PERIOD AND LOOKING AT WHAT WE'RE

00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:16.435
THE STRATEGIES THAT THEY WERE

00:22:16.501 --> 00:22:18.737
USING FOR HYGIENE AND SANITATION

00:22:18.804 --> 00:22:21.406
AND VACCINATION OF THE AT RISK

00:22:21.473 --> 00:22:22.908
POPULATION AND SO.

00:22:22.974 --> 00:22:24.543
WE WERE WORKING HAND IN HAND

00:22:24.609 --> 00:22:25.377
WITH THE COUNTY WE WERE

00:22:25.444 --> 00:22:27.045
STRATEGIZING THEY WERE DOING A

00:22:27.112 --> 00:22:28.914
LOT OF WORK THROUGHOUT THAT

00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:29.981
PERIOD.

00:22:30.048 --> 00:22:31.416
I THINK THAT.

00:22:31.483 --> 00:22:33.418
WE ACTIVATED ARE EMERGENCY

00:22:33.485 --> 00:22:35.620
OPERATIONS SYSTEM UNDER OUR AND

00:22:35.687 --> 00:22:39.691
SORT OF AN EMERGENCY PLAN WHEN

00:22:39.758 --> 00:22:42.527
AND THAT IS WHEN WE WOULD THEN --

00:22:42.594 --> 00:22:44.329
AND ACTIVATE OUR EMERGENCY

00:22:44.396 --> 00:22:45.764
OPERATIONS CENTER BRINGING

00:22:45.831 --> 00:22:47.499
TOGETHER ALL OF THE COUNTY'S

00:22:47.566 --> 00:22:49.735
SHARE THAT INFORMATION --

00:22:49.801 --> 00:22:51.103
MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE COLLECTING

00:22:51.169 --> 00:22:52.738
IT IS A REPORTABLE DISEASE WE

00:22:52.804 --> 00:22:54.139
COLLECT THAT DATA WE HAD BEEN

00:22:54.206 --> 00:22:56.374
COLLECTING THAT DATA WORKING

00:22:56.441 --> 00:22:56.875
WITH THEM.

00:22:56.942 --> 00:22:59.544
AND IT BECAME MORE.

00:22:59.611 --> 00:23:01.480
I I THINK WE CONTINUE THAT WORK

00:23:01.546 --> 00:23:03.815
WE WORKED WITH THEM ON THE

00:23:03.882 --> 00:23:05.484
VACCINE DISTRIBUTION --

00:23:05.550 --> 00:23:07.419
PRIORITIZATION OF VACCINE MAKING

00:23:07.486 --> 00:23:10.355
SURE THAT THEY HAD ALL THE TOOLS

00:23:10.422 --> 00:23:12.457
AND KNOWLEDGE THAT THEY NEEDED.

00:23:12.524 --> 00:23:13.625
TO GET OUT THERE AND BOXING THE

00:23:13.692 --> 00:23:15.060
NEW POPULATION THIS WAS

00:23:15.127 --> 00:23:16.461
SOMETHING NEW WE HADN'T SEEN

00:23:16.528 --> 00:23:18.130
HAPPEN A IN OUR HOMELESS

00:23:18.196 --> 00:23:20.198
POPULATION IV DRUG USERS SO I

00:23:20.265 --> 00:23:21.767
THINK WE WERE LEARNING A LOT.

00:23:21.833 --> 00:23:23.235
ALONG WITH MANY OTHER STATES AND

00:23:23.301 --> 00:23:24.136
I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT THE

00:23:24.202 --> 00:23:25.604
MIDWEST IN MICHIGAN AND OTHER

00:23:25.670 --> 00:23:28.874
STATES THEY WERE FACING THE SAME

00:23:28.940 --> 00:23:30.742
THING AND AND I'M PART OF A LOT

00:23:30.809 --> 00:23:31.510
OF VAST --

00:23:31.576 --> 00:23:33.512
POLICY COMMITTEE AND WE WERE

00:23:33.578 --> 00:23:35.347
COMPARING NUMBERS AND REALLY

00:23:35.413 --> 00:23:37.949
LOOKING UP THE ABILITY.

00:23:38.016 --> 00:23:41.119
TO TURN THE TIDE ON THE OUTBREAK

00:23:41.186 --> 00:23:41.987
AND CAL --

00:23:42.053 --> 00:23:46.758
THAN MOST IT'S WITH SOME SINCE I

00:23:46.825 --> 00:23:48.760
THE OUTBREAKS BLASTED LONGER AND

00:23:48.827 --> 00:23:49.961
WERE BAKER --

00:23:50.028 --> 00:23:51.396
SO I THINK THAT THERE WAS A LOT

00:23:51.463 --> 00:23:53.265
OF IMPORTANT WORK BEING DONE AND

00:23:53.331 --> 00:23:54.766
CAN WE ALWAYS GO BACK AND SAY

00:23:54.833 --> 00:23:55.934
COULD WE HAVE DONE A LITTLE MORE

00:23:56.001 --> 00:23:57.335
A LITTLE SOONER I I DON'T KNOW

00:23:57.402 --> 00:24:00.172
AND BUT I THINK THAT THEY WERE

00:24:00.238 --> 00:24:01.206
DOING A LOT OF WORK.

00:24:01.273 --> 00:24:02.641
ON THE GROUND.

00:24:02.707 --> 00:24:05.510
TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF AND

00:24:05.577 --> 00:24:07.245
AND LESSEN THE OUTBREAK

00:24:07.312 --> 00:24:07.546
[inaudible]

00:24:07.612 --> 00:24:09.714
OUT OF WELL WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO

00:24:09.781 --> 00:24:10.749
DISAGREE ON THAT.

00:24:10.816 --> 00:24:13.218
BY THEY FAILED MISERABLY WHICH

00:24:13.285 --> 00:24:14.953
IS WHY THERE WAS AN AUDIT WHEN A

00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:16.888
LEGISLATOR GETS INVOLVED TO ASK

00:24:16.955 --> 00:24:19.591
FOR AN AUDIT ON A REAL SITUATION

00:24:19.658 --> 00:24:20.892
NOT ONE THAT WE CONTRIVE.

00:24:20.959 --> 00:24:23.161
WHICH I KNOW THAT WE WANT TO DO

00:24:23.228 --> 00:24:26.798
IT TIMES --

00:24:26.865 --> 00:24:27.365
EIGHTY A PLAN OF ACTION AND

00:24:27.432 --> 00:24:28.867
EDUCATE.

00:24:28.934 --> 00:24:30.402
CATION THAT CAN GO DOWN.

00:24:30.468 --> 00:24:32.404
MAN OF ACTION IN EDUCATION DOES

00:24:32.470 --> 00:24:34.206
NOT SUGGEST THAT YOU SEND

00:24:34.272 --> 00:24:36.274
HOMELESS PEOPLE TO CLINICS --

00:24:36.341 --> 00:24:37.576
WHEN THERE'S A PROBLEM YOU GOT

00:24:37.642 --> 00:24:39.177
TO GO ON THE STREETS AND AND DO

00:24:39.244 --> 00:24:41.813
THE WORK WHICH ULTIMATELY WE DID?

00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:43.215
I MEAN WE'RE TALKING A PERIOD OF

00:24:43.281 --> 00:24:45.517
MONTHS.

00:24:45.584 --> 00:24:46.852
AT WHICH POINT.

00:24:46.918 --> 00:24:48.119
OF I MEAN I GUESS WHEN THE

00:24:48.186 --> 00:24:51.022
COUNTY FAILS WHEN THE CITY FAILS.

00:24:51.089 --> 00:24:53.491
AND THE STATE IS NOT A BACKUP.

00:24:53.558 --> 00:24:56.328
THAT CONCERNS ME AND THIS THIS

00:24:56.394 --> 00:24:59.364
EXAMPLE I AGREE WE HADN'T SEEN

00:24:59.431 --> 00:25:00.799
ANYTHING LIKE IT FOR SOME TIME

00:25:00.866 --> 00:25:04.436
BUT THERE IS CLEAR DOCUMENTATION

00:25:04.502 --> 00:25:06.204
THERE IS CLEAR EVIDENCE.

00:25:06.271 --> 00:25:07.439
THAT PEOPLE WERE RAISED IN THE

00:25:07.505 --> 00:25:08.673
RED FLAG.

00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:10.809
AND AT SOME POINT.

00:25:10.876 --> 00:25:13.078
CALL STARTED TO GO TO THE STATE

00:25:13.144 --> 00:25:14.813
BECAUSE THE LOCAL JURISDICTION

00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:15.947
WASN'T ACTING.

00:25:16.014 --> 00:25:18.750
SO. FOR ME I THINK THE

00:25:18.817 --> 00:25:21.186
IMPLEMENTATION PIECE OF THIS WAS

00:25:21.253 --> 00:25:23.822
WHAT CONCERNS ME THE MOST --

00:25:23.889 --> 00:25:25.657
AND AND THE FACT THAT --

00:25:25.724 --> 00:25:27.626
COUNTIES NEED TO BE HELD

00:25:27.692 --> 00:25:29.094
ACCOUNTABLE MY OWN COUNTY WHO

00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:31.363
I'VE HAD A AND A WONDERFUL

00:25:31.429 --> 00:25:33.632
WORKING RELATIONSHIP WITH --

00:25:33.698 --> 00:25:36.101
AND THE CITY IT DID NOT GO WELL

00:25:36.167 --> 00:25:38.270
IF SO IF THAT'S IN IT EXAMPLE I

00:25:38.336 --> 00:25:40.772
MEAN ONCE THE VACCINATIONS GOT

00:25:40.839 --> 00:25:42.507
THERE ONCE THEY DECIDED TO GO ON

00:25:42.574 --> 00:25:44.509
TO THE STREETS. TO ACTUALLY FIND

00:25:44.576 --> 00:25:46.144
THE PEOPLE AND GO INTO THE RIVER

00:25:46.211 --> 00:25:47.579
BEDS -- I

00:25:47.646 --> 00:25:48.980
WENT IN A SAN DIEGO RIVER

00:25:49.047 --> 00:25:50.849
CONSERVANCY BRINGS UP THE ISSUE

00:25:50.916 --> 00:25:52.384
OF ONE OF THEIR MEETINGS.

00:25:52.450 --> 00:25:56.288
AND BY AND FAR THEY ARE NOT THE

00:25:56.354 --> 00:25:57.355
ONE YOU.

00:25:57.422 --> 00:25:59.491
ARE AT A BOARD MEETING --

00:25:59.557 --> 00:26:01.826
I HAVE I HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT

00:26:01.893 --> 00:26:03.194
THAT AND MAYBE THAT'S WHY

00:26:03.261 --> 00:26:04.663
THERE'S A PIECE OF LEGISLATION

00:26:04.729 --> 00:26:06.865
WHICH IS NOT OUR PURPOSE TO TALK

00:26:06.932 --> 00:26:08.166
ABOUT TODAY IN TERMS OF

00:26:08.233 --> 00:26:10.669
ACCOUNTABILITY BUT I I AM

00:26:10.735 --> 00:26:14.439
CONCERNED ABOUT THE RESPONSE --

00:26:14.506 --> 00:26:16.207
YOUR I WOULD JUST SAY DIFFICULT

00:26:16.274 --> 00:26:17.976
CONCLUDE YOUR RESPONSE.
