UNITS HAVE PAID THE FIFTY.

00:29:45.917 --> 00:29:47.585
THAT'S BECAUSE OF THOSE FORTY

00:29:47.652 --> 00:29:49.554
TWO PROJECTS ONLY TO HAVE

UNITS WILL BE PERMANENTLY

00:30:14.045 --> 00:30:15.980
SUBSIDIZED AFFORDABLE. AND THAT

00:30:16.047 --> 00:30:21.219
THESE FEES ARE COST UP TO TWENTY

00:30:21.286 --> 00:30:23.154
THOUSAND DOLLARS PER DOOR. SO I

00:30:23.221 --> 00:30:24.055
WAS SPEAKING TO A DEVELOPER

00:30:24.122 --> 00:30:25.490
YESTERDAY WHO IS ONE OF THE

00:30:25.557 --> 00:30:27.659
PROJECT IS ALL OF A TWO HUNDRED

00:30:27.725 --> 00:30:30.195

MOVING FORWARD BECAUSE OF THOSE

00:30:39.537 --> 00:30:41.873

SUBSIDIZED AFFORDABLE. SO TO ME

00:31:00.091 --> 00:31:02.527

00:31:06.698 --> 00:31:08.066

COMMUNITIES HAVE A LOT OF TIMES

00:36:38.529 --> 00:36:40.565
THE WHEN IT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT

00:36:40.631 --> 00:36:42.900

00:36:58.683 --> 00:37:00.751
IMPACTS ON THE COMMUNITY AND

THOSE NUMBERS FROM I DON'T KNOW

00:37:12.763 --> 00:37:15.066
THAT IT'S SUPER INTENTIONAL TO

00:37:15.132 --> 00:37:15.866
MAKE IT CERTAINLY NOT TO MAKE

MONEY- IT'S SO THAT THEY CAN

00:37:17.635 --> 00:37:19.036

00:37:25.643 --> 00:37:28.179
PLAN WITHOUT THE DENSITY BONUS

00:37:28.245 --> 00:37:30.181
THOSE ARE FACTORED IN SO I THINK

00:37:30.247 --> 00:37:31.682
THIS IS A GOOD COMPROMISE AND

00:37:31.749 --> 00:37:33.451
BEING ABLE TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN.

00:37:33.517 --> 00:37:35.519

AB SEVENTEEN THIRTY EIGHT WOULD

00:46:20.644 --> 00:46:21.612
REQUIRE THE ADOPTION OF

00:46:21.678 --> 00:46:22.713
MANDATORY BUILDING STANDARDS FOR

00:46:22.779 --> 00:46:23.881
THE INSTALLATION OF ELECTRIC

00:46:23.947 --> 00:46:25.215
VEHICLE CHARGING STATIONS AN

00:46:25.282 --> 00:46:26.850
EXISTING MULTI FAMILY DWELLINGS

00:46:26.917 --> 00:46:29.419
SCHOOLS HOTELS AND MOTELS AND

00:46:29.486 --> 00:46:30.554
NON RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENTS

00:46:30.621 --> 00:46:31.855
DURING RETROFITS TO EXISTING

00:46:31.922 --> 00:46:33.657
BUILDING SAID TO BE CLEAR THIS

00:46:33.724 --> 00:46:35.125
IS NOT RETROFITTING.

00:46:35.192 --> 00:46:37.194
AUTOMATICALLY THERE'S A TRIGGER

00:46:37.261 --> 00:46:38.562
THAT WILL DO IT RIGHT JUST LIKE

00:46:38.629 --> 00:46:39.897
WE HAVE A STORM WATER RETENTION

00:46:39.963 --> 00:46:41.498
BASINS AND OTHER SUCH THINGS AND

00:46:41.565 --> 00:46:43.500
LANDIS IT'S A VERY COMMON THING

00:46:43.567 --> 00:46:44.835
IF YOU'RE GONNA BE PULLING UP A

00:46:44.902 --> 00:46:47.237
PARKING LOT THEN PUTTING IN SOME

00:46:47.304 --> 00:46:49.606
EVEY ARE CHARGING STATIONS- AND

00:46:49.673 --> 00:46:50.941
SO FOR THE MORE THAT WHEN THE

ADDITIONS OR ALTERATIONS ARE

00:46:52.276 --> 00:46:56.079

LEAST 25% OF SPACES MUST BE EASY

00:46:59.149 --> 00:47:00.851
READY. MEANING THAT THE PARKING

00:47:00.918 --> 00:47:02.819
SPACES HAVE BOTH THE RACEWAY AND

00:47:02.886 --> 00:47:04.521
LOWER POWER LEVEL TWO ELECTRICAL

00:47:04.588 --> 00:47:05.722
OUTLETS. THIS IS REALLY

00:47:05.789 --> 00:47:07.457
IMPORTANT BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT

00:47:07.524 --> 00:47:09.526
WHEN WE SEE WE SEE THIS WITH

00:47:09.593 --> 00:47:10.827
SOLAR YOU'VE SEEN THIS OF SOLAR

00:47:10.894 --> 00:47:12.663
IF YOU'VE BEEN AND LOCAL

00:47:12.729 --> 00:47:14.131
GOVERNMENT- YOU SEE THIS WITH

00:47:14.198 --> 00:47:15.299
EV'S. IT DOESN'T HELP AND THE

00:47:15.365 --> 00:47:17.201
BEST ANALOGY IS LIKE PUTTING IN

00:47:17.267 --> 00:47:17.768
PLUMBING FOR TOILET BUT NOT

00:47:17.834 --> 00:47:18.769
PUTTING IN THE TOILET DOESN'T

00:47:18.835 --> 00:47:21.772
HELP YOU GO TO THE BATHROOM.

00:47:21.838 --> 00:47:22.439
RIGHT SO WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS.

00:47:22.506 --> 00:47:23.473
YOU KNOW BUILDING STANDARDS ARE

00:47:23.540 --> 00:47:24.675
REQUIRING US TO PUT IN THE

00:47:24.741 --> 00:47:26.476
PLUMBING FOR IT BUT NOT THE

00:47:26.543 --> 00:47:27.544
FINAL CHARGER. AND SO WE'RE

00:47:27.611 --> 00:47:29.213
DOING THE WIRING BUT NOT THIS-

00:47:29.279 --> 00:47:31.081
THE FINAL THING YOU'RE NOT

00:47:31.148 --> 00:47:31.949
GETTING TO THAT FINAL. IN POINT

00:47:32.015 --> 00:47:33.917
AND IT'S LIKE OUR LAST MILE

00:47:33.984 --> 00:47:35.052
PROBLEM WITH BROADBAND YOU SEE

00:47:35.118 --> 00:47:35.786
THIS ACROSS THE BOARD SO WHAT

00:47:35.852 --> 00:47:37.621
WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO DO. IS

00:47:37.688 --> 00:47:38.956
FIX THAT THAT PROBLEM HERE AND

00:47:39.022 --> 00:47:40.824
MAKE SURE THAT AS WE EXPAND OUR

00:47:40.891 --> 00:47:41.925
EASY FAST OR EVEN CHARGING

00:47:41.992 --> 00:47:43.493
NETWORK ACROSS THE STATE. THAT

00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:45.229
WERE BEING VERY INCLUSIVE AND

00:47:45.295 --> 00:47:46.630
THAT LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. WHO

00:47:46.697 --> 00:47:48.265
LIVE IN MULTI FAMILY. RENTERS

00:47:48.332 --> 00:47:50.767
ARE NOT LEFT OUT OF OUR OWN YOU

00:47:50.834 --> 00:47:51.835
KNOW STRIVING FOR A MORE

00:47:51.902 --> 00:47:54.071
SUSTAINABLE CALIFORNIA. WELL THE

00:47:54.137 --> 00:47:54.871
BUILDING STANDARDS COMMISSION UP

00:47:54.938 --> 00:47:56.673
DOCTOR EASY CAPABLE AND EASY

00:47:56.740 --> 00:47:57.574
READY REQUIREMENTS THE FOR

00:47:57.641 --> 00:47:59.042
EXISTING BUILDINGS. IT DID NOT

00:47:59.109 --> 00:48:00.410
INCLUDE EASY INSTALLED

00:48:00.477 --> 00:48:02.045
REQUIREMENTS WHICH REQUIRE THE

00:48:02.112 --> 00:48:03.680
INFRASTRUCTURE. PLUS THE ACTUAL

00:48:03.747 --> 00:48:05.449
CHARGING STATION ITSELF AND JUST

00:48:05.515 --> 00:48:06.950
TO BE CLEAR THIS CHARGING

00:48:07.017 --> 00:48:08.185
STATION DOESN'T NEED TO BE

00:48:08.252 --> 00:48:08.819
OPERATED. BY THE MULTI FAMILY

00:48:08.885 --> 00:48:10.887
APARTMENT OWNER IT COULD BE ONE

00:48:10.954 --> 00:48:12.189
OF OUR MULTIPLE DELUDE OF

00:48:12.256 --> 00:48:13.624
INNOVATIVE CALIFORNIA COMPANIES

00:48:13.690 --> 00:48:15.125
THAT ARE DOING FASTER. DOING

00:48:15.192 --> 00:48:16.793
CHARGING SO IT DOESN'T HAVE TO

00:48:16.860 --> 00:48:18.729
BE THEM THEY CAN YOU KNOW. YOU

00:48:18.795 --> 00:48:19.863
PARTNER WITH ANY NUMBER OF OUR

00:48:19.930 --> 00:48:21.932
EVEY CHARGERS IN THE STATE IN

00:48:21.999 --> 00:48:23.900
ORDER TO ACCOMPLISH THIS. AB

00:48:23.967 --> 00:48:25.369
SEVENTEEN THIRTY EIGHT WOULD

00:48:25.435 --> 00:48:25.902
REQUIRE REGULATIONS TO BE

00:48:25.969 --> 00:48:26.803
CONSIDERED ADOPTED TO FILL THIS

00:48:26.870 --> 00:48:29.172
GAP. I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT

00:48:29.239 --> 00:48:31.041
TO MENTION THAT AS THE COST OF

00:48:31.108 --> 00:48:32.409
EV'S. HAS DECREASED IN RECENT

00:48:32.476 --> 00:48:33.644
YEARS AND IS EXPECTED TO

00:48:33.710 --> 00:48:34.845
CONTINUE TO DECLINE IN THE

00:48:34.911 --> 00:48:36.747
FUTURE. EV'S ARE BECOMING MORE

00:48:36.813 --> 00:48:37.881
ACCESSIBLE TO LOW INCOME

00:48:37.948 --> 00:48:39.650
POPULATIONS HOWEVER THE LACK OF

00:48:39.716 --> 00:48:41.718
ACCESS TO HOME CHARGING. REMAINS

00:48:41.785 --> 00:48:43.654
THE MAJOR BARRIER TO EASY

00:48:43.720 --> 00:48:46.056
OPTION. AND ALSO HEALTH ENERGY

00:48:46.123 --> 00:48:47.457
COMMISSION FOUND THAT LOW INCOME

00:48:47.524 --> 00:48:48.625
COMMITTEES WE HAVE FEWER EASY

00:48:48.692 --> 00:48:50.160
CHARGING STATIONS PER CAPITA.

00:48:50.227 --> 00:48:51.228
THE MIDDLE AND HIGH INCOME

00:48:51.295 --> 00:48:56.400
COMMUNITIES RELIABLE ACCESS. TO

00:48:56.466 --> 00:48:57.000
EASY CHARGING IS PARTICULARLY

00:48:57.067 --> 00:48:58.869
CHAO J. FOR A- AND THOSE. IN

00:48:58.935 --> 00:48:59.736
MOLD UNIT. STUDIES HAVE SHOWN

00:48:59.803 --> 00:49:01.938
THAT MUCH AS 685% OF CHARGING.

00:49:02.005 --> 00:49:03.507
FOR PERSONAL ELECTRIC VEHICLES

00:49:03.573 --> 00:49:05.776
OCCURS AT HOME. BUT PEOPLE

00:49:05.842 --> 00:49:06.576
LIVING IN APARTMENTS AND

00:49:06.643 --> 00:49:08.345
CONDOMINIUMS. KNOWN AS MULTI

00:49:08.412 --> 00:49:09.446
FAMILY BUILDINGS ARE MULTI UNIT

00:49:09.513 --> 00:49:11.415
DWELLINGS. DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO

00:49:11.481 --> 00:49:12.749
THESE CHARGING STATIONS. SO WHEN

00:49:12.816 --> 00:49:14.351
YOU LOOK AT TAKING AWAY LAYER

00:49:14.418 --> 00:49:16.219
AFTER LAYER OF BARRIERS TO

00:49:16.286 --> 00:49:17.954
ADOPTIONS OF THE VIS. YOU DO

00:49:18.021 --> 00:49:19.623
HAVE THE COST OF THE CARS THAT

00:49:19.690 --> 00:49:20.991
WE HAVE THE CLEAN VEHICLE REBATE

00:49:21.058 --> 00:49:22.659
PROGRAM AND WE NEED YOU MORE WE

00:49:22.726 --> 00:49:23.860
NEEDED A SECONDARY CAR MARKET.

00:49:23.927 --> 00:49:27.064
ALL OF THOSE THINGS BUT IF YOU

00:49:27.130 --> 00:49:28.965
DON'T HAVE A WAY FOR RENTERS TO

00:49:29.032 --> 00:49:30.067
CHARGE AT HOME. RENTERS ARE NOT

00:49:30.133 --> 00:49:32.002
GOING TO BUY. AND WHEN WE LOOK

00:49:32.069 --> 00:49:33.537
AT THE CREATING A STATE- CALL

00:49:33.603 --> 00:49:34.504
CALIFORNIA REACHING OUR- CLIMATE

00:49:34.571 --> 00:49:35.639
GOALS AND REALLY ADDRESSING THE

00:49:35.706 --> 00:49:36.640
CLIMATE CRISIS FOR THE NEXT

00:49:36.707 --> 00:49:39.076
GENERATION. THIS IS ONE OF THE

00:49:39.142 --> 00:49:40.377
THINGS WE HAVE TO DO WHEN

00:49:40.444 --> 00:49:40.977
THERE'S A HUGE EQUITY LENS.

00:49:41.044 --> 00:49:42.646
AROUND IT AS WELL. SO AB

00:49:42.713 --> 00:49:43.647
SEVENTEEN THIRTY IT WOULD

00:49:43.714 --> 00:49:44.748
PROVIDE GREATER MORE RELIABLE

00:49:44.815 --> 00:49:46.149
ACCESS TO CHARGING

00:49:46.216 --> 00:49:46.717
INFRASTRUCTURE. TO LOW AND

00:49:46.783 --> 00:49:47.651
MODERATE INCOME COMMUNITIES AND

00:49:47.718 --> 00:49:48.685

THE TOILET THAT MIGHT BE A

00:53:36.780 --> 00:53:37.681
COMPROMISE THAT WORKS AND THAT'S

00:53:37.747 --> 00:53:39.516
WHY WE'RE DOING THE PAYING A

00:53:39.583 --> 00:53:40.817
BILL THAT WOULD GIVE THE FUNDING

00:53:40.884 --> 00:53:42.652
FOR IT BECAUSE I THINK THAT WAS

00:53:42.719 --> 00:53:44.788
SOME OF THE ISSUES A LITTLE BIT

00:53:44.854 --> 00:53:45.555

DEVELOPERS ARE TAKING ON THAT

00:53:59.836 --> 00:54:02.272

DIFFICULT THAT'S WHY WE HAVE THE

00:54:35.672 --> 00:54:39.209
TRIGGER IS ONE OF THE AMENDMENTS

00:54:39.275 --> 00:54:39.809

ALREADY HAD TOP TOUCHING THE

00:54:40.744 --> 00:54:42.379

00:54:42.445 --> 00:54:43.546
TRIGGER FOR INSTALLING THE EV'S

00:54:43.613 --> 00:54:46.383
RIGHT SO YOU KNOW AND I'M HAPPY

00:54:46.449 --> 00:54:49.619

THERE'S MORE CLARIFICATION THAT

00:54:50.720 --> 00:54:52.622
WE NEED TO DO. A GREAT ANY OTHER

00:54:52.689 --> 00:54:53.990
AND THEN I'M GONNA TURN THE

00:54:54.057 --> 00:54:55.892
CHAIR BACK OVER TO MISS WEEKS.

00:54:55.959 --> 00:54:59.829
BUT THIS BILL IS COMPLICATED AS

00:54:59.896 --> 00:55:01.197
YOU KNOW WE'VE WE'VE TALKED

00:55:01.264 --> 00:55:03.667
ABOUT IT AND I WILL JUST SAY

00:55:03.733 --> 00:55:06.469
THAT I WILL SUPPORT IT I AM

00:55:06.536 --> 00:55:09.039
CONCERNED ABOUT THE AMENDMENTS

00:55:09.105 --> 00:55:11.007
GOING FORWARD SO CAN YOU EXPLAIN

00:55:11.074 --> 00:55:12.008
THE AMENDMENTS THAT YOU'RE

00:55:12.075 --> 00:55:14.678
PLANNING TO TAKE BECAUSE TOO

00:55:14.744 --> 00:55:16.946
OFTEN IN COMMITTEES WE SAY WE

00:55:17.013 --> 00:55:18.848
RESERVE THE RIGHT TO KIND OF A

00:55:18.915 --> 00:55:20.650
CHANGE OF VOTE BUT I WANT TO

00:55:20.717 --> 00:55:24.320
HEAR ABOUT THE AMENDMENTS- AND-

00:55:24.387 --> 00:55:25.955
I UNDERSTAND I MEAN I HAVE TO

00:55:26.022 --> 00:55:27.724
READ THEM BUT JUST BECAUSE

00:55:27.791 --> 00:55:28.625
THEY'RE NINE AMENDMENTS SO WE'RE

00:55:28.692 --> 00:55:30.560
TAKING A LOT OF THE MOMENT SO

00:55:30.627 --> 00:55:32.495
THE FIRST ONE- IS TO REFLECT THE

00:55:32.562 --> 00:55:33.897
BILL'S PROVISION TO THAT EFFECT

00:55:33.963 --> 00:55:35.265
EXISTING PARKING FACILITIES

00:55:35.331 --> 00:55:36.266
RATHER THAN BUILDINGS DIRECTLY

00:55:36.332 --> 00:55:37.767
SO THAT'S THE- THAT WHEN THEY

00:55:37.834 --> 00:55:40.003
TOUCH THE PARKING LOT IN A

00:55:40.070 --> 00:55:40.937
RETROFIT. RIGHT WHEN THEY'RE

00:55:41.004 --> 00:55:42.072
GOING AND THEY'RE DOING

00:55:42.138 --> 00:55:43.073
REDEVELOPMENT ANYWAYS THAT IS

00:55:43.139 --> 00:55:44.441
TOUCHING THE PARKING LOT NOT

00:55:44.507 --> 00:55:46.443
LIKE A BUILDING OVER HERE SO

00:55:46.509 --> 00:55:47.544
THAT THE FIRST AMENDMENT THE

00:55:47.610 --> 00:55:49.045
SECOND AMENDMENT- IS THE

00:55:49.112 --> 00:55:50.413
DEFINITION OF WHAT'S COST

00:55:50.480 --> 00:55:52.182

01:00:28.725 --> 01:00:30.493
DIDN'T DO A STANDARD FOR EASY

01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:34.030
INSTALLED. AT AS POLICY MAKERS.

01:00:34.097 --> 01:00:37.867
IF WE DON'T HAVE THAT CHARGER.

01:00:37.934 --> 01:00:39.702
NO ONE AND WHO'S A RENTER AND AN

01:00:39.769 --> 01:00:40.636

DOLLARS TO INSTALL. A PROPER

01:00:49.445 --> 01:00:50.913
CHARGER WE USE A PLUG SO IT

01:00:50.980 --> 01:00:51.848
TAKES EIGHTEEN HOURS. TO CHARGER

01:00:51.914 --> 01:00:54.484
EVEY. RIGHT SO I LOOK AT THAT

01:00:54.550 --> 01:00:55.785
AND LIKE I CAN DO THAT BECAUSE

01:00:55.852 --> 01:00:57.854
OF A SINGLE FAMILY HOME WITH A

01:00:57.920 --> 01:00:58.888

01:01:00.957 --> 01:01:02.759
TO CHARGE YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO

BUY EASY. AND SO WE WILL HAVE IT

01:01:04.527 --> 01:01:05.962
AND THEY DIDN'T ADOPTED. SO I'M

01:01:06.029 --> 01:01:07.797
HAPPY TO LOOK AT GOING THROUGH

01:01:07.864 --> 01:01:08.431
THE BUILDING STANDARDS

01:01:08.498 --> 01:01:09.532
COMMISSION GO THROUGH THAT

01:01:09.599 --> 01:01:11.734
PROCESS WE'VE TAKEN A MOMENT SET

01:01:11.801 --> 01:01:12.802
TO MAKE IT BETTER WITH YOUR

01:01:12.869 --> 01:01:14.570
PROCESS. BUT I'M OPEN I JUST

01:01:14.637 --> 01:01:16.706
WANT TO GET TO THE PLACE AND

01:01:16.773 --> 01:01:17.740
THAT HAVE THE EEVEE INSTALLED

01:01:17.807 --> 01:01:19.542
THAT'S WHAT I WANT OKAY SORRY I

01:01:19.609 --> 01:01:21.210
GUESS MY QUESTION TO YOU IS DO

01:01:21.277 --> 01:01:22.779
YOU HAVE ANY UNDERSTANDING OF

01:01:22.845 --> 01:01:24.213
WHY THE BUILDING STANDARDS

01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:24.847
COMMISSION DECLINED TO DO THAT.

01:01:24.914 --> 01:01:27.216
I ASSUME IT WAS A PROCESS OF

01:01:27.283 --> 01:01:30.620
PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT. AND BUT IT

01:01:30.686 --> 01:01:32.622
DOES. THE REALITY IS HOW THEY

01:01:32.688 --> 01:01:33.723
GOT TO THE PLACE WHERE EVEN

01:01:33.790 --> 01:01:35.625
INSTALLED. MAYBE IT WAS BECAUSE

01:01:35.691 --> 01:01:37.393
THEY'RE NOT WELL THAT WASN'T

01:01:37.460 --> 01:01:38.561
FUNDING SO WE HAVE THE FUNDING

01:01:38.628 --> 01:01:39.695
BILL AS I MENTIONED BEFORE-

01:01:39.762 --> 01:01:41.264
THAT'S ON THE OTHER SIDE. SO

01:01:41.330 --> 01:01:42.065
THAT COULD CHANGE THE

01:01:42.131 --> 01:01:43.900
CALCULATION. AND THE OTHER THING

01:01:43.966 --> 01:01:45.034
THAT I THINK IS REALLY IMPORTANT

01:01:45.101 --> 01:01:47.070
ABOUT THE CALCULATION. IS EVEN

01:01:47.136 --> 01:01:48.204
IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED

01:01:48.271 --> 01:01:49.505
BUDGET WHICH I KNOW IS NOT A

01:01:49.572 --> 01:01:50.706
FINAL BUDGET. THEY'RE PUTTING A

01:01:50.773 --> 01:01:52.575
LOT OF MONEY FOR EV'S IN THERE.

01:01:52.642 --> 01:01:53.843
SO THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY THIS

01:01:53.910 --> 01:01:55.578
YEAR I THINK A COMMITMENT. FROM

01:01:55.645 --> 01:01:57.013
ALL SIDES TO ADDRESS. THE

01:01:57.080 --> 01:01:57.580
FUNDING SIDE BECAUSE I THINK

01:01:57.647 --> 01:02:00.016
THAT'S THE THING- AND- AND I

01:02:00.083 --> 01:02:01.818
THINK THAT. WE AS POLICYMAKERS

01:02:01.884 --> 01:02:03.152
NEED TO MAKE CLEAR. THIS IS WHAT

01:02:03.219 --> 01:02:05.154
OUR OBJECTIVE IS. I AM HAPPY TO

01:02:05.221 --> 01:02:07.056
WORK WITH YOU IN YOUR OFFICE. ON

01:02:07.123 --> 01:02:08.024
ACHIEVING OUR MUTUALLY AGREED

01:02:08.091 --> 01:02:09.826
UPON GOALS YEAH I GUESS IT WOULD

01:02:09.892 --> 01:02:11.461
BE REALLY IMPORTANT HELPFUL FOR

01:02:11.527 --> 01:02:12.762
ME TO UNDERSTAND WHY THE

01:02:12.829 --> 01:02:13.463
BUILDING STANDARDS COMMISSION

01:02:13.529 --> 01:02:15.665
DECLINED TO DO THAT AND I. AND I

01:02:15.731 --> 01:02:17.800
SUSPECT THAT I KNOW THE REASON

01:02:17.867 --> 01:02:18.701
WHY- AND THAT'S BECAUSE IF YOU

01:02:18.768 --> 01:02:20.169
LOOK AT THE GOVERNOR'S VETO

01:02:20.236 --> 01:02:21.604
MESSAGE IN THE ANALYSIS FOR TWO

01:02:21.671 --> 01:02:23.039
THOUSAND NINETEEN. HE TALKS

01:02:23.106 --> 01:02:23.840
ABOUT BALANCING ARCHED CHARGING

01:02:23.906 --> 01:02:25.274
INFRASTRUCTURE OBJECTIVES. WITH

01:02:25.341 --> 01:02:26.709
OUR EFFORTS TO EXPAND AFFORDABLE

01:02:26.776 --> 01:02:28.478
HOUSING. AND THAT GETS TO MY

01:02:28.544 --> 01:02:30.113
SECOND CONCERN ABOUT THE BILL.

01:02:30.179 --> 01:02:31.747
WHICH IS COST BECAUSE- THIS

01:02:31.814 --> 01:02:33.049
ISN'T GONNA BE FREE RIGHT

01:02:33.116 --> 01:02:34.684
THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS A FREE

01:02:34.750 --> 01:02:36.319
LUNCH AND WHEN YOU PUT THIS

01:02:36.385 --> 01:02:37.086
INFRASTRUCTURE AND- SOMEBODY HAS

01:02:37.153 --> 01:02:38.754
TO PAY FOR IT. AND WHAT I WORRY

01:02:38.821 --> 01:02:40.456
ABOUT IS THAT. THE PROPERTY

01:02:40.523 --> 01:02:41.524
OWNERS ARE GONNA PASS THOSE

01:02:41.591 --> 01:02:42.959
COSTS ALONG TO THE RENTER'S

01:02:43.025 --> 01:02:44.861
ALONG TO THE TENANTS. ALONG TO

01:02:44.927 --> 01:02:46.929
WHOEVER THOSE FOLKS MAY BE. AND

01:02:46.996 --> 01:02:48.998
IF THIS IF THIS ISN'T CRAFTED IN

01:02:49.065 --> 01:02:50.099
THE RIGHT WAY. YOU COULD

01:02:50.166 --> 01:02:51.601
LITERALLY END UP BECOMING A

01:02:51.667 --> 01:02:52.835
REPRESS A REGRESSIVE TAX WE

01:02:52.902 --> 01:02:54.837
COULD BE INCREASING RENTS. IN

01:02:54.904 --> 01:02:56.472
AFFORDABLE HOUSING WOULD WE

01:02:56.539 --> 01:02:58.975
COULD BE INCREASING RENTS IN- IN

01:02:59.041 --> 01:03:00.610
IN MULTI FAMILY BUILDINGS. IN A

01:03:00.676 --> 01:03:02.945
WAY THAT I HAVE A LOT OF

01:03:03.012 --> 01:03:03.546
CONCERNS AROUND THAT'S WHY I

01:03:03.613 --> 01:03:05.648
THINK THAT THIS IS. ONE OF THE

01:03:05.715 --> 01:03:07.016
THINGS THAT WE STRUGGLE WITH IN

01:03:07.083 --> 01:03:08.918
THIS COMMITTEE I SUPPORTED A LOT

01:03:08.985 --> 01:03:09.519
OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANDATES. ON

01:03:09.585 --> 01:03:10.553
OUR NEW CONSTRUCTION.

01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:11.387
UNDERSTANDING THAT WERE DRIVING

01:03:11.454 --> 01:03:13.389
UP THE COST OF HOUSING IN THE IN

01:03:13.456 --> 01:03:14.590
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BUT WE

01:03:14.657 --> 01:03:15.758
HAVE TO BE HONEST ABOUT THAT

01:03:15.825 --> 01:03:18.461
THESE ARE POLICY TRADE OFFS AND

01:03:18.528 --> 01:03:19.529
SO. WHAT I'M WORRIED ABOUT IS

01:03:19.595 --> 01:03:21.063
THAT WE'RE JUMPING IN HERE- IT

01:03:21.130 --> 01:03:21.898
KNOWING THAT. IN ADMINISTRATION

01:03:21.964 --> 01:03:22.965
AND I THINK. AS YOU MENTIONED

01:03:23.032 --> 01:03:25.268
THIS IS A RESTRICTION THAT IS

01:03:25.334 --> 01:03:26.802
DEEPLY COMMITTED TO EXPANDING IF

01:03:26.869 --> 01:03:27.670
YOU TRY. INTEREST DEEPLY COMMIT

01:03:27.737 --> 01:03:28.938
HARD BY. GOALS THIS IS A

01:03:29.005 --> 01:03:30.006
GOVERNOR THAT'S ACTUALLY TAKEN

01:03:30.072 --> 01:03:31.774
STEPS THAT ARE LEGISLATURE HAS

01:03:31.841 --> 01:03:33.242
BEEN ABLE TO TYPE. THEY WERE A

01:03:33.309 --> 01:03:34.844
LITTLE NERVOUS ABOUT DOING THIS

01:03:34.911 --> 01:03:35.678
PROBABLY BECAUSE THEY WERE

01:03:35.745 --> 01:03:36.779
WORRIED ABOUT HOW WHAT IMPACT

01:03:36.846 --> 01:03:37.747
OUR HOUSING SUPPLY IN AFFORDABLE

01:03:37.813 --> 01:03:39.482
HOUSING. AND NOW WE'RE GOING TO

01:03:39.549 --> 01:03:41.184
JUMP IN AND SO I'M- I'M VERY

01:03:41.250 --> 01:03:42.485
CONCERNED ABOUT THAT ISSUE SO

01:03:42.552 --> 01:03:44.587
TALK TO ME A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

01:03:44.654 --> 01:03:45.421
THE POSSIBILITY OF THIS BECOMING

01:03:45.488 --> 01:03:46.889
A REGRESSIVE TAX. SO THIS IS NOT

01:03:46.956 --> 01:03:48.858
A REGRESSIVE TAX MR GABRIEL. AND

01:03:48.925 --> 01:03:50.459
I THINK FRAMING IT AS SUCH. YOU

01:03:50.526 --> 01:03:51.894
COULD FRAME ANY OF THE

01:03:51.961 --> 01:03:53.362
ENVIRONMENTAL THINGS THAT WE DO.

01:03:53.429 --> 01:03:55.064
YOU CAN IN THE- FRAME. PUTTING

01:03:55.131 --> 01:03:57.300
SOLAR ON ROOFS AS- A REGRESSIVE

01:03:57.366 --> 01:04:00.603
TAX YOU COULD. FRAME ANY OF THE

01:04:00.670 --> 01:04:01.904
THINGS THAT WE DO AS A

01:04:01.971 --> 01:04:03.573
REGRESSIVE TAX I DON'T THINK

01:04:03.639 --> 01:04:04.607
THAT'S WHAT WE SHOULD BE TALKING

01:04:04.674 --> 01:04:06.709
ABOUT. I THINK WHAT WE SHOULD BE

01:04:06.776 --> 01:04:08.010
TALKING ABOUT. YOU KNOW IT'S

01:04:08.077 --> 01:04:08.945
MORE EXPENSIVE TO WERE PUTTING

01:04:09.011 --> 01:04:10.580
STORM WATER RETENTION BASINS

01:04:10.646 --> 01:04:11.547
BASINS WHICH IS A REQUIREMENT

01:04:11.614 --> 01:04:13.216
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THAN TO

01:04:13.282 --> 01:04:14.817
PUT IN  FAST CHARGER. AND THIS

01:04:14.884 --> 01:04:15.851
BILL IS ALLOWING. MULTI FAMILY

01:04:15.918 --> 01:04:17.286
APARTMENT UNIT OWNERS. TO

01:04:17.353 --> 01:04:19.589
PARTNER WITH ALL OF OUR EVEY

01:04:19.655 --> 01:04:21.023
CHARGING COMPANIES. THEY DO NOT.

01:04:21.090 --> 01:04:22.825
BEARING THE BURDEN OF IT. RIGHT

01:04:22.892 --> 01:04:24.026
THAT WE PUT IN A LOT OF

01:04:24.093 --> 01:04:26.829
SAFEGUARDS AROUND. MY OTHER BILL

01:04:26.896 --> 01:04:28.397
THAT THE REVENUE TAX IS LOOKING

01:04:28.464 --> 01:04:29.999
AT THE GRANT PROGRAM. BECAUSE

01:04:30.066 --> 01:04:30.766
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

01:04:30.833 --> 01:04:32.068
AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND COSTS

01:04:32.134 --> 01:04:32.835
THAT ARE GOING FOR AFFORDABLE

01:04:32.902 --> 01:04:35.238
HOUSING. AND THAT WILL TARGET

01:04:35.304 --> 01:04:36.706
ESPECIALLY. THAT TAX INCENTIVE

01:04:36.772 --> 01:04:38.407
RELIEF OR THE GRANT AND SENSE OF

01:04:38.474 --> 01:04:40.176
RELIEF PROGRAM. AT AFFORDABLE

01:04:40.243 --> 01:04:42.211
HOUSING. SO THAT BILL TOGETHER

01:04:42.278 --> 01:04:43.713
WITH THIS BILL AND THEIR THEIR

01:04:43.779 --> 01:04:45.114
THEIR COMPANION BILLS WHAT

01:04:45.181 --> 01:04:45.848
THEY'RE NOT. PHYSICALLY JOINED

01:04:45.915 --> 01:04:47.183
UP IN LANGUAGE YET BECAUSE

01:04:47.250 --> 01:04:48.551
THAT'S NOT HOW THE PROCESS WORKS

01:04:48.618 --> 01:04:51.053
TO DO THAT IN THE SENATE. YOU

01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:52.054
DON'T DO THAT IN THE ASSEMBLY.

01:04:52.121 --> 01:04:53.889
BUT THEY ARE. WE WROTE THEM

01:04:53.956 --> 01:04:54.857
TOGETHER WE'RE MOVING THEM

01:04:54.924 --> 01:04:55.424
FORWARD TOGETHER. AND THAT

01:04:55.491 --> 01:04:56.225
ADDRESSES YOUR ISSUE AROUND

01:04:56.292 --> 01:04:57.193
AFFORDABLE HOUSING BECAUSE WE

01:04:57.260 --> 01:04:58.995
DON'T WANT THOSE COSTS TO BE.

01:04:59.061 --> 01:05:00.563
PASSED ON TO THE RENTERS WHICH

01:05:00.630 --> 01:05:02.231
IS WHY THE- TAX INCENTIVE

01:05:02.298 --> 01:05:03.833
PROGRAM OR THE TAX CREDIT.

01:05:03.899 --> 01:05:05.334
INCENTIVE GRANT PROGRAM. WILL BE

01:05:05.401 --> 01:05:06.902
GOING SPECIFICALLY TALKING

01:05:06.969 --> 01:05:08.337
AFFORDABLE HOUSING THE STATE

01:05:08.404 --> 01:05:10.206
CALIFORNIA. I APPRECIATE THAT

01:05:10.273 --> 01:05:12.875
BUT TO ME THAT'S NOT. TO ME WHO

01:05:12.942 --> 01:05:13.676
PAYS FOR IT IS NOT A MINOR

01:05:13.743 --> 01:05:16.612
DETAIL. AND AGAIN YOU KNOW WHAT

01:05:16.679 --> 01:05:18.147
I WOULD LOVE TO SEE SUPPORTING

01:05:18.214 --> 01:05:19.915
THIS IS THERE SOME KIND OF AND I

01:05:19.982 --> 01:05:21.584
KNOW THAT YOU WORKED ON A TAX

01:05:21.651 --> 01:05:23.386
CREDIT IN THE COMMITTEE WASN'T

01:05:23.452 --> 01:05:25.087
IN LOVE WITH THAT IDEA SO MAYBE

01:05:25.154 --> 01:05:27.757
A GRANT PROGRAM. IF WE CAN

01:05:27.823 --> 01:05:28.624
THROUGH THE GENERAL FUND OR-

01:05:28.691 --> 01:05:29.959
OTHER MAKE. FUNDING STILL. OF

01:05:30.026 --> 01:05:31.527
THE THINGS WITH. WE CAN THAT WE

01:05:31.594 --> 01:05:32.828
ARE PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES. FOR

01:05:32.895 --> 01:05:33.963
EASY CHARGING STATIONS BUT WE'RE

01:05:34.030 --> 01:05:35.431
NOT PUTTING THE COST OF THAT

01:05:35.498 --> 01:05:36.766
INFRASTRUCTURE ON SOME OF OUR

01:05:36.832 --> 01:05:38.601
MOST RENT BURDENED FOLKS I MEAN

01:05:38.668 --> 01:05:40.569
YOU WE ALL OF THE STUDIES WE'VE

01:05:40.636 --> 01:05:41.771
SEEN ABOUT. HOW MUCH OF PEOPLE'S

01:05:41.837 --> 01:05:43.406
INCOME RENT IS HEATING UP. LET'S

01:05:43.472 --> 01:05:45.141
WORK WITH THAT LET'S LET'S

01:05:45.207 --> 01:05:46.108
FIGURE OUT THE FUNDING MECHANISM

01:05:46.175 --> 01:05:48.010
SO THAT WE'RE DRAWING FROM. A

01:05:48.077 --> 01:05:50.046
BROADER GROUP OF FOLKS TO PAY

01:05:50.112 --> 01:05:51.647
FOR IT. RATHER THAN HAVING THOSE

01:05:51.714 --> 01:05:53.282
COSTS BE BORNE BY THE RENTERS

01:05:53.349 --> 01:05:56.585
pTHAT IS WHERE INSTRUCTORS I

01:05:56.652 --> 01:05:57.887
THINK YOU'VE HIT ON A REALLY

01:05:57.953 --> 01:05:59.388
IMPORTANT ISSUE. I THINK THAT

01:05:59.455 --> 01:06:00.823
YOU KNOW THERE'S THIS NOTION IN

01:06:00.890 --> 01:06:01.557
ECONOMICS THAT SUPPLY CREATES

01:06:01.624 --> 01:06:03.559
ITS OWN DEMAND THAT YOU WHEN YOU

01:06:03.626 --> 01:06:05.194
WHEN YOU START INSTALLING. EVEY

01:06:05.261 --> 01:06:06.462
CHARGING STATIONS THAT WILL OPEN

01:06:06.529 --> 01:06:07.997
UP OPPORTUNITIES FOR FOLKS IN

01:06:08.064 --> 01:06:09.098
MULTI FAMILY HOUSING TO BUY

01:06:09.165 --> 01:06:10.533
ELECTRIC VEHICLES I THINK THAT'S

01:06:10.599 --> 01:06:12.068
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT FOR CLIMATE

01:06:12.134 --> 01:06:14.270
GOALS. BUT IF WE'RE ON ONE HAND.

01:06:14.337 --> 01:06:14.770
YOU KNOW DOING A LITTLE

01:06:14.837 --> 01:06:16.505
SOMETHING TO UP OUR CLIMATE

01:06:16.572 --> 01:06:18.107
GOALS AND ON THE OTHER HAND.

01:06:18.174 --> 01:06:19.342
MAKING AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS

01:06:19.408 --> 01:06:20.910
WORSE. NOT SURE THAT WE'VE MADE

01:06:20.976 --> 01:06:22.078
THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE IN IN

01:06:22.144 --> 01:06:23.679
IN THE WAY THAT I WOULD LIKE TO

01:06:23.746 --> 01:06:26.349
DO THAT AND SO THAT'S WHAT I'D

01:06:26.415 --> 01:06:27.583
LIKE TO THINK ABOUT. HOW DO WE

01:06:27.650 --> 01:06:29.652
FUND THIS IN A WAY THAT WE CAN

01:06:29.719 --> 01:06:30.953
KNOW. THAT IT'S NOT IMPOSING.

01:06:31.020 --> 01:06:31.721
ADDITIONAL COSTS ON OUR MOST

01:06:31.787 --> 01:06:33.956
REDFORD FOLKS SO I THAT'S THAT'S

01:06:34.023 --> 01:06:34.757
WHAT I'M STRUGGLING WITH THIS

01:06:34.824 --> 01:06:36.625
BILL TODAY- YOU HAVE ASKED ME

01:06:36.692 --> 01:06:38.694
FOR A COURTESY VOTE I'M I'M- YOU

01:06:38.761 --> 01:06:39.695
KNOW THINKING ABOUT DOING THAT

01:06:39.762 --> 01:06:40.596
IF THERE'S A COMMITMENT TO

01:06:40.663 --> 01:06:41.831
CONTINUE TO WORK IN A AND

01:06:41.897 --> 01:06:43.466
ADDRESS THESE ISSUES. BUT I'M

01:06:43.532 --> 01:06:44.700
NOT COMFORTABLE WITH THE BILL IN

01:06:44.767 --> 01:06:46.669
ITS CURRENT VERSION SO I'M GONNA

01:06:46.736 --> 01:06:47.737

THOUGHTFUL YOU ARE. BUT I WOULD

01:06:55.711 --> 01:06:56.979
CONTINUE TO WORK THESE ISSUES

01:06:57.046 --> 01:06:58.114
THAT THERE'S- A FUNDING ISSUE.

01:06:58.180 --> 01:06:59.548
RESERVE MY RIGHT ON THE FLOORTO

01:06:59.615 --> 01:07:01.584

REALLY APPRECIATE THAT MR GABER.

01:07:02.852 --> 01:07:04.120
AB EIGHTEEN SEVENTY THREE IS

01:07:04.186 --> 01:07:05.755
THAT ALL YOU NEED TO LOOK AT FOR

01:07:05.821 --> 01:07:07.056
THE FUNDING MECHANISM AND ANY

01:07:07.123 --> 01:07:08.524
FEEDBACK THAT YOU HAVE OR- MISS

01:07:08.591 --> 01:07:09.725
QUIRK-SILVA THAT YOU HAVE.

01:07:09.792 --> 01:07:10.760
AROUND THAT THAT'S WHERE THAT

01:07:10.826 --> 01:07:12.461
ALL THAT SO THAT WAS ALL GOING

01:07:12.528 --> 01:07:13.462
THERE. WE DECIDED VERY

01:07:13.529 --> 01:07:14.930
STRATEGICALLY TO PUT. THAT THERE

01:07:14.997 --> 01:07:16.432
AND THEN THIS IS THIS IS A

01:07:16.499 --> 01:07:17.633
HOUSING AND THAT THAT WAS THE

01:07:17.700 --> 01:07:19.635
EASY BILL RIGHT. WE TALKED ABOUT

01:07:19.702 --> 01:07:20.803
DO WE DO IT ALL TOGETHER. IT

01:07:20.870 --> 01:07:22.705
WOULD GET TROUBLE REFERRED. IT'S

01:07:22.772 --> 01:07:24.573
SO EASY TO KILL SOMETHING LIKE

01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:25.708
THAT. BUT WE'RE PUTTING IT

01:07:25.775 --> 01:07:27.410
TOGETHER SO EIGHTEEN SEVENTY

01:07:27.476 --> 01:07:28.744
THREE. I'LL MAKE SURE MY FOR

01:07:28.811 --> 01:07:30.112
EFFORT TO THAT YOURSELF CAN.

MAYBE GO HAVE A- TALK ABOUT. I

01:07:31.847 --> 01:07:33.549
WOULD LOVE TO HAVE COMMERCE. AND

01:07:33.616 --> 01:07:35.050
I ALSO THINK THAT THAT THINKING

01:07:35.117 --> 01:07:36.018
THROUGH. AND UNDERSTOOD. WHY THE

01:07:36.085 --> 01:07:37.987
BUILDINGS. CAN LOOKED AT THIS

01:07:38.053 --> 01:07:38.821
ISSUE. ARRIVED AT A DIFFERENT.

01:07:38.888 --> 01:07:39.622
THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT US TO

01:07:39.688 --> 01:07:40.689
UNDERSTAND BECAUSE OF THEIR

01:07:40.756 --> 01:07:41.657
DETERMINATION WISE. WE FEEL

01:07:41.724 --> 01:07:42.858
REALLY STRONGLY ABOUT CLIMATE

01:07:42.925 --> 01:07:44.593
WE'RE GONNA PUT A TON OF MONEY

01:07:44.660 --> 01:07:45.728
TV THIS YEAR BUT WERE WORRIED

01:07:45.795 --> 01:07:47.363
ABOUT THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING

01:07:47.430 --> 01:07:48.831
OPPONENT. I WANT UNDERSTAND THAT

01:07:48.898 --> 01:07:50.833
BECAUSE THEN MAYBE WE CAN WORK

01:07:50.900 --> 01:07:51.734
TOGETHER TO CRAFT A BETTER BELL.

01:07:51.801 --> 01:07:52.835
YOU CAN REMOVE ALL OF THIS

01:07:52.902 --> 01:07:53.903
OPPOSITION AND WE CAN DO

01:07:53.969 --> 01:07:55.704
SOMETHING THAT WE CAN ALL FEEL

01:07:55.771 --> 01:07:56.872
GOOD ABOUT. I ALWAYS WANT TO

01:07:56.939 --> 01:07:58.908
BETTER BILL MR GABRIEL. THANK

01:07:58.974 --> 01:07:59.642
YOU. SORRY MIT CONCERNS ARE

01:07:59.708 --> 01:08:00.776
SIMILAR- THAT'S WHY I ALWAYS

01:08:00.843 --> 01:08:02.545
LIKE HIM TO GO FIRST. A VERY

01:08:02.611 --> 01:08:04.647
ELOQUENT AND- STADIUMS. HOWEVER

01:08:04.713 --> 01:08:06.549
I HAVE JUST A LITTLE BIT OF A-

01:08:06.615 --> 01:08:08.684
DIFFERENT SPIN ON THIS. FOR ME

01:08:08.751 --> 01:08:10.186
WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS.

01:08:10.252 --> 01:08:11.754
ADVANCING IN MARKET BEFORE IT'S

01:08:11.821 --> 01:08:14.023
OF IT IF. IT'S READY- THERE ARE

01:08:14.089 --> 01:08:16.091
A LOT OF PEOPLE. ESPECIALLY WHEN

01:08:16.158 --> 01:08:16.892
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT AFFORDABLE

01:08:16.959 --> 01:08:19.228
HOMES AND- AFFORDABLE APARTMENT.

01:08:19.295 --> 01:08:21.230
THEY THEY CAN'T EVEN DREAM OF

01:08:21.297 --> 01:08:24.133
OWNING. AN EEVEE. AND YET WHAT

01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:25.000
THIS IS DOING IS

01:08:25.067 --> 01:08:26.602
ADVANCINGJUSTICE THAT'S GOING TO

01:08:26.669 --> 01:08:28.237
BE IMMEDIATELY PASSED ALONG TO

01:08:28.304 --> 01:08:30.606
THEM SPECIFICALLY. AS IT. IS A

01:08:30.673 --> 01:08:32.675
COST SHARING FOR IS IT IT'S A

01:08:32.741 --> 01:08:34.410
TWO HUNDRED FIFTY APARTMENT

01:08:34.477 --> 01:08:35.044
BUILDING. ALL THOSE PEOPLE ARE

01:08:35.110 --> 01:08:37.012
GONNA BE SHARING IN THE COSTS.

01:08:37.079 --> 01:08:38.681
OF EVEY THAT ONLY MAYBE TEN

01:08:38.747 --> 01:08:40.983
PEOPLE ARE USING. AND THIS IS

01:08:41.050 --> 01:08:43.352
THE CONCEPT OF HAVING THEM BUILD

01:08:43.419 --> 01:08:44.587
THE INFRASTRUCTURE UP TO THE

01:08:44.653 --> 01:08:46.322
BUILDING IS SOMEWHAT LIKE FILES

01:08:46.388 --> 01:08:48.691
WAS WAY BACK IN. TWO THOUSAND.

01:08:48.757 --> 01:08:50.192
WHEN I THINK HUNTINGTON BEACH IS

01:08:50.259 --> 01:08:51.594
THE FIRST CITY. THAT HAD FILES

01:08:51.660 --> 01:08:54.430
PUT IN. THEY PUT IT IN UP TO THE

01:08:54.497 --> 01:08:55.998
SERVICE. THE UP TO THE STREET.

01:08:56.065 --> 01:08:57.700
UP TO THE THIS WHAT THE SERVICE

01:08:57.766 --> 01:08:59.602
ADDRESS. BUT IT WAS UP TO THE

01:08:59.668 --> 01:09:03.339
CUSTOMER TO DO THE REST OF IT.

01:09:03.405 --> 01:09:04.640
AND I WOULD IMAGINE THAT EVENT.

01:09:04.707 --> 01:09:06.942
WILL HAPPEN IS. MARKET WILL

01:09:07.009 --> 01:09:12.615
FORCE. OF THE- PEOPLE WHO OWN.

01:09:12.681 --> 01:09:13.616
THE BUILDINGS TO SAY HEY YOU

01:09:13.682 --> 01:09:15.751
KNOW WHAT. OF PARTICULAR PEOPLE

01:09:15.818 --> 01:09:16.752
ARE STARTING DECLINE TO RENT OR

01:09:16.819 --> 01:09:18.320
PAY THE RENTS WE ARE ARE

01:09:18.387 --> 01:09:20.556
CHARGING BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE

01:09:20.623 --> 01:09:22.892
VIS AND WE DON'T HAVE ANY V.

01:09:22.958 --> 01:09:25.361
PLACE FOR THEM AND THAT'S THE

01:09:25.427 --> 01:09:27.196
POINT AT WHICH THEY START ADDING

01:09:27.263 --> 01:09:29.431
THOSE ON AND THEY CAN THEY CAN

01:09:29.498 --> 01:09:32.001
ADD THOSE ON AND BE PART OF THE

01:09:32.067 --> 01:09:36.038
RANT- BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT

01:09:36.105 --> 01:09:38.474
WILL BE RIGHT WE KEEP IMPACTING

01:09:38.541 --> 01:09:42.778
THE VERY THING THAT WE'RE TRYING INCREASING THE

01:09:42.845 --> 01:09:45.814
COSTS FOR THE FOR THE VIVID UP

01:09:45.881 --> 01:09:47.650
POINT BUILDING OF SOMETHING THAT

01:09:47.716 --> 01:09:50.286
MAKES THE OF RENTS AND THE COST

01:09:50.352 --> 01:09:53.055
OF HOMES UNAFFORDABLE- IF I'M

01:09:53.122 --> 01:09:54.590
NOT GOING TO OWN AN EEVEE UNTIL

01:09:54.657 --> 01:09:57.226
I ABSENT TELL MY- CAR DIES.

01:09:57.293 --> 01:10:00.195
WHICH IS GOING TO HAPPEN- ARE

01:10:00.262 --> 01:10:01.797
YOU KNOW WHAT I DON'T WANT TO

01:10:01.864 --> 01:10:04.099
PAY FOR HER T. V. STATION IT'S

01:10:04.166 --> 01:10:05.568
SITTING IN MY GARAGE AND HANG IN

01:10:05.634 --> 01:10:07.536
THERE FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND

01:10:07.603 --> 01:10:10.739
YEARS AND USED- AND I THINK IT'S

01:10:10.806 --> 01:10:15.444
BETTER TO LET THE MARKET.

01:10:15.511 --> 01:10:17.146
ADVANCED HIS GOALS. IN WILL OF

01:10:17.212 --> 01:10:18.714
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW A LOT OF CAN'T

01:10:18.781 --> 01:10:21.216
EVEN AFFORD AN EEVEE AND THEY

01:10:21.283 --> 01:10:23.886
WON'T FOR A LONG TIME AND- SO

01:10:23.953 --> 01:10:25.988
UNTIL THAT MARKET COMES INTO

01:10:26.055 --> 01:10:28.557
PLAY I THINK WE'RE WE'RE

01:10:28.624 --> 01:10:30.693
IMPACTING THE LOW THE AFFORDABLE

01:10:30.759 --> 01:10:33.395
HOUSING PART OF THIS FAR MORE

01:10:33.462 --> 01:10:35.965
CHEN WERE MAKING A DENT IN THE

01:10:36.031 --> 01:10:36.966
ENVIRONMENTAL PART OF IT SO

01:10:37.032 --> 01:10:39.568
THAT'S WHERE I WENT ON AND IF I

01:10:39.635 --> 01:10:40.803
CAN RESPOND TO THAT SO WHAT'S

01:10:40.869 --> 01:10:42.037
HAPPENING IS THE MARKET IS

01:10:42.104 --> 01:10:45.341
BUILDING EV'S. RAN UPPER MIDDLE

01:10:45.407 --> 01:10:47.176
CLASS AND UPPER CLASS

01:10:47.242 --> 01:10:49.244
NEIGHBORHOODS IN MY CITY WHEN I

01:10:49.311 --> 01:10:51.146
KNEW ABOUT DEVELOPMENT IN THEIR

01:10:51.213 --> 01:10:53.482
AUTOMATICALLY INSTALLING ATVS

01:10:53.549 --> 01:10:54.817
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY'RE NOT DOING

01:10:54.883 --> 01:10:56.819
THAT THEY'RE NOT DOING THAT ANTI

01:10:56.885 --> 01:10:57.886
ONE INVESTOR THEY'RE NOT DOING

01:10:57.953 --> 01:10:59.221
THAT OF SOME PARTS OF OCEANSIDE

01:10:59.288 --> 01:11:02.491
AND THAT'S NOT DOING THAT.

01:11:02.558 --> 01:11:05.694
BECAUSE THE- BECAUSE THEY DON'T

01:11:05.761 --> 01:11:07.763
HAVE A TO DO IT AND THERE'S NO

01:11:07.830 --> 01:11:09.999
AND TO DO AND SO IF WE WAIT FOR

01:11:10.065 --> 01:11:11.600
THE MARKET TO DO AT TO DECIDE

01:11:11.667 --> 01:11:15.270
WHEN LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS CAN

01:11:15.337 --> 01:11:15.838
HAVE ACCESS TO EV'S WE ARE

01:11:15.904 --> 01:11:17.606
EXACERBATING EXISTING INEQUITIES

01:11:17.673 --> 01:11:20.476
AND STATE AND I THINK I KNOW AND

01:11:20.542 --> 01:11:22.745
WE MADE THIS DISAGREE ON THIS- I

01:11:22.811 --> 01:11:24.046
THINK THAT'S NOT WHAT WE SHOULD

01:11:24.113 --> 01:11:25.581
BE DOING AND I THINK YOU KNOW

01:11:25.648 --> 01:11:27.082
THAT'S WHY I APPRECIATE THE WORK

01:11:27.149 --> 01:11:28.784
OF THE CHAIR AND THE COMMITTEE

01:11:28.851 --> 01:11:30.352
CONSULTANT SO MUCH ON THIS BILL

01:11:30.419 --> 01:11:33.155
IS BECAUSE- IT AND IT'S NOT LIKE

01:11:33.222 --> 01:11:34.957
OVERNIGHT SOMEBODY HAS TO BUILD

01:11:35.024 --> 01:11:37.726
US RIGHT WE WENT NEXT AND- THE

01:11:37.793 --> 01:11:39.328
NEXT CYCLE SO NOT INTERVIEW.

01:11:39.395 --> 01:11:40.863
CYCLEWITH THE NAY THING MONTHS

01:11:40.929 --> 01:11:44.199
WE TOOK I'M- PLEASE BECAUSE IT

01:11:44.266 --> 01:11:46.702
WILL BE AS YOU TO I MEAN IF YOU

01:11:46.769 --> 01:11:48.671
LOOK AT MOST MORE MULTI FAMILY

01:11:48.737 --> 01:11:49.772
APARTMENTS THEY DON'T PICK UP

01:11:49.838 --> 01:11:50.773
THE PARKING LOT VERY OFTEN IT'S

01:11:50.839 --> 01:11:52.741
NOT LIKE THEY DID HAVE A PARKING

01:11:52.808 --> 01:11:55.044
LOT USUALLY MOST MULTI FAMILY

01:11:55.110 --> 01:11:55.678
DEVELOPERS WILL AVOID ANYTHING

01:11:55.744 --> 01:11:56.912
THAT TRIGGERS THE STORM WATER

01:11:56.979 --> 01:11:58.147
RETENTION BASIN REQUIREMENTS THE

01:11:58.213 --> 01:12:00.215
PARKING LOTS AND SO THEY WILL

01:12:00.282 --> 01:12:02.317
AVOID DEVELOPING BEYOND THAT

01:12:02.384 --> 01:12:05.020
UNLESS THERE IS A MARKET

01:12:05.087 --> 01:12:06.422
INCENTIVE TO DO SO THE MORE THEY

01:12:06.488 --> 01:12:08.090
WANT TO DO THIS UNLESS THERE WAS

01:12:08.157 --> 01:12:10.092
A MORE SENSITIVE SO IT TRIGGER

01:12:10.159 --> 01:12:10.859
FOR THIS IT MEANT TO BE GRADUAL

01:12:10.926 --> 01:12:13.462
SO THAT WE- GET TO THE PLACE.

01:12:13.529 --> 01:12:14.863
THAT BY TWO WE DO HAVE AN

01:12:14.930 --> 01:12:15.931
EXPANSIVE NETWORK AND WE'RE

01:12:15.998 --> 01:12:16.865
BEING INCLUSIVE OF LOW INCOME

01:12:16.932 --> 01:12:19.468
CALIFORNIANS IT AND RENTERS I

01:12:19.535 --> 01:12:21.403
THINK THIS IS MORE ABOUT RENTERS

01:12:21.470 --> 01:12:22.805
AND LOW INCOME THE MORE OF THE

01:12:22.871 --> 01:12:25.541
MIDDLE- AND FROM SOUTH WITH I

01:12:25.607 --> 01:12:26.675
APPRECIATE YOUR POSITION AND

01:12:26.742 --> 01:12:28.277
MAYBE HOW A DIFFERENCE OF ABOUT

01:12:28.343 --> 01:12:30.145
THAT ACTUAL YOU CAN ANSWER ONE

01:12:30.212 --> 01:12:32.381
OF THE ISSUES IS THAT HIGHER AND

01:12:32.448 --> 01:12:33.749
MIDDLE INCOME PEOPLE CAN

01:12:33.816 --> 01:12:35.284
ACTUALLY AFFORD EV'S AND THAT'S

01:12:35.350 --> 01:12:36.685
WHY IT HAPPENED AND BUILT THEIR

01:12:36.752 --> 01:12:39.755
WHEREAS THE OTHER. COMMUNITIES

01:12:39.822 --> 01:12:41.190
WHERE THEY DON'T HAVE AS MANY

01:12:41.256 --> 01:12:42.958
PEOPLE CAN AFFORD THEY'RE NOT

01:12:43.025 --> 01:12:45.461
DOING THAT THEY'RE AND THEY'RE

01:12:45.527 --> 01:12:46.929
NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD

01:12:46.995 --> 01:12:49.498
IT I MEAN I CAN NO MORE EASY

01:12:49.565 --> 01:12:50.899
CHARGERS AND HIGHER INCOME AND

01:12:50.966 --> 01:12:51.533
THEY'RE PUTTING THEM IN PUBLIC

01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:54.503
SPACES TO BE ABLE TO ACCOMMODATE

01:12:54.570 --> 01:12:56.538
THE FEW THAT THERE ARE BUT AS

01:12:56.605 --> 01:12:58.440
THEIR BECOME MORE MORE I SAID IN

01:12:58.507 --> 01:12:59.541
AN APARTMENT COMPLEX THAT'S

01:12:59.608 --> 01:13:02.878
BEING BUILT IF THAT'S ONE OF THE

01:13:02.945 --> 01:13:03.445
DETERMINING FACTORS WHETHER

PUTTING IN A CERTAIN AMOUNT

01:13:09.084 --> 01:13:10.552

RENOVATING THE BUILDING. CORRECT

FOR FIVE YEARS. SO WHAT THIS

01:24:23.091 --> 01:24:25.293
BILL WOULD DO IF I WERE A

EIGHTY TWO WITH THE PREVIOUS. A

01:24:39.974 --> 01:24:40.708
BIG LEGISLATION BECAUSE THE

01:24:40.775 --> 01:24:42.177
PROBLEM IS WHEN THAT OWNERSHIP

01:24:42.243 --> 01:24:43.645
CHANGES HANDS ESPECIALLY FOR A

01:24:43.711 --> 01:24:45.680
LONG TIME OWNER OF A TEN YEAR

01:24:45.747 --> 01:24:47.148
APARTMENT- THAT TEN UNIT

01:24:47.215 --> 01:24:48.750
APARTMENT IS GOING TO COST A

01:24:48.817 --> 01:24:49.884
WHOLE. MORE IN THERE FOR THE

01:24:49.951 --> 01:24:52.554
MONEY THAT- A IT TAKES TO

01:24:52.620 --> 01:24:56.191
MAINTAIN THAT. IS GOING TO

01:24:56.257 --> 01:24:57.592
CHANGE- YOU KNOW THE IN OTHER

01:24:57.659 --> 01:24:58.726
WORDS. YOU'RE GONNA DRIVE THE

01:24:58.793 --> 01:25:00.128
MARKET UP FOR. PEOPLE BUYING

01:25:00.195 --> 01:25:02.263
APARTMENT BUILDINGS. AND DAD AND

01:25:02.330 --> 01:25:04.132
I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD BE

01:25:04.199 --> 01:25:04.999
INTERFERING IN THE MARKET LIKE

01:25:05.066 --> 01:25:09.270
THAT- I THINK- MAY. DAY I THINK

01:25:09.337 --> 01:25:12.474
IS GOING DOWN A ROAD. THAT IS.

01:25:12.540 --> 01:25:14.108
BEING WAY TOO RESTRICTIVE ON

01:25:14.175 --> 01:25:15.643
PEOPLE THAT ARE JUST TRY THEY'RE

01:25:15.710 --> 01:25:18.313
TRYING TO MAKE A LIVING TILL.

01:25:18.379 --> 01:25:20.081
AND ANDERSTON- THE RENT CONTROL

01:25:20.148 --> 01:25:21.716
BUT YOU KNOW. PEOPLE THAT ARE

01:25:21.783 --> 01:25:23.651
RENTING HAVE LEASES- THAT ARE

01:25:23.718 --> 01:25:25.987
USUALLY ONE YEAR. OR ONTH TO

01:25:26.054 --> 01:25:28.089
MONTH. AND IF THEY DON'T WANT TO

01:25:28.156 --> 01:25:29.757
BE IN THAT SITUATION THEN WE

01:25:29.824 --> 01:25:31.392
NEED TO THAT EITHER THEY CAN

01:25:31.459 --> 01:25:34.496
GIVE ENTERED LONGER LEASES. OR

01:25:34.562 --> 01:25:36.197
OR THE YOU KNOW THE- STATE THEY

01:25:36.264 --> 01:25:37.665
LIVE IN RENT CONTROL AREAS THAT

01:25:37.732 --> 01:25:39.534
ARE ALREADY BEING IMPOSED ON ON.

01:25:39.601 --> 01:25:42.737
THE RENTER ITSELF. YEAH I HAVE A

01:25:42.804 --> 01:25:43.771
LOT OF CONCERNS ABOUT WHERE THIS

01:25:43.838 --> 01:25:45.507
BILL IS HEADED OUR WAY THIS ACT

01:25:45.573 --> 01:25:47.609
WITH THIS APPROACH IS HEADED IN

01:25:47.675 --> 01:25:48.810
TERMS OF PRIVATE PROPERTY

RIGHTS- AND- THE MARKET. ITSELF

01:25:52.647 --> 01:25:54.249
BECAUSE SOMETIMES THAT MARKET IS

01:25:54.315 --> 01:25:55.884
WHAT TAKES A RUN DOWN APARTMENT

01:25:55.950 --> 01:25:58.086
BUILDING. AND RENOVATED AND

01:25:58.152 --> 01:26:02.524

01:26:13.635 --> 01:26:15.370
LOT OF THE OLD ONES DON'T

01:26:15.436 --> 01:26:16.604
ESPECIALLY THE ONES DOWN IN THE

01:26:16.671 --> 01:26:17.739
SOUTH BAY AREA THAT HAVE THE-

YOU'RE SAYING IS ESSENTIALLY

01:26:29.884 --> 01:26:31.786
THAT PERSON WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO

RATE YOU KNOW THEY CAN READ JUST

01:26:39.661 --> 01:26:41.863
AS JUST AS THE RENT TO GO TO

01:26:41.930 --> 01:26:43.731
MORE OF A MARKET RATE THAT WILL.

01:26:43.798 --> 01:26:46.901
WILL HELP OFFSET THE COSTS OF

01:26:46.968 --> 01:26:48.870
ACQUISITION FOR THAT BUILDING.

01:26:48.937 --> 01:26:53.441

OF WHAT HAPPENS WITH THE MARKET

01:26:55.310 --> 01:26:56.945
