FOR OUR FIRST MEETING OF TWENTY TWENTY TODAY IS JANUARY FOURTEENTH WE DO NOT YET HAVE. A CORE WITH ENOUGH MEMBERS BUT WE HAVE ENOUGH MEMBERS TO START AS A SUB COMMITTEE SO WE WILL DO SO I WILL NOTE THAT ITEM NUMBER ONE AB THREE TWENTY FIVE. BUT THIS AROMAS HAS BEEN PROPOSED FOR THE CONSENT AGENDA SO WE'LL TAKE THAT UP. WHEN WE DO GET A QUORUM WE HAVE MR DAILY HERE. IF YOU LIKE TO PRESENT SO THIS IS OUR ITEM NUMBER TWO EIGHTY SIX EIGHTY SEVEN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS- THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR- WORKER ON THIS ALONG WITH THE WORK OF YOUR STAFF. THE BILL ALLOWS REAL ESTATE BROKERS TO FORM LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANIES AS AN OPTION SIMPLY AS THEIR AT THEIR OPTION. ADDING LLC USED TO THE LIST OF ELIGIBLE REAL ESTATE BROKER LICENSEES WILL PUT REAL ESTATE BROKERS ON THE SAME FOOTING AS OTHER PROFESSIONALLY LICENSE GROUPS. THIS BILL CAN HELP SAVE THEM TIME AND REDUCE COSTS BECAUSE OPERATING AS LLC'S CAN MEAN MORE STREAMLINED REPORTING AND FILING REQUIREMENTS STAND AS A CORPORATION. THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS BRING REALISTIC COMPANIES IN LINE WITH OTHER LLC'S REGARDING MANDATORY INSURANCE COVERAGE. WITH ME IS MATT HARGROVE FROM THE CALIFORNIA BUSINESS PROPERTIES ASSOCIATION WHO ARE THE SPONSORS OF THE BILL. MATT WOULD YOU LIKE TO CHIME IN MICHIGAN MEMBERS FIRST WITNESS PLEASE MATTHEW HARPER WITH THE CALIFORNIA BUSINESS PROPERTIES ASSOCIATION AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THE- VERY THOROUGH COMMITTEE ANALYSIS HAVE BEEN SEVERAL ATTEMPTS ON THIS OVER THE YEARS. OUR INDUSTRY MISSED THE BOAT WHEN THAT THESE CONVERSATIONS WERE HAPPENING IN THE NINETIES AND THAT WE HOPE THAT WE'LL BE ABLE TO CORRECT THAT TODAY. CURRENTLY AS IF YOU RUN A REAL ESTATE BROKERAGE YOU CAN FILE AS AT C. CORP THIS WILL ALLOW OUR COMPANIES TO ALSO TAKE ADVANTAGES OF THE LLC'S. THAT THIS BODY IN ITS WISDOM AS PASSED SEVERAL YEARS AGO WE WANT TO THANK THE CONSUMER ATTORNEYS AND THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS AND JEFF. FOR HELPING US AS THIS BILL HIT THIS COMMITTEE LAST YEAR IT WAS NOT IN SHAPE TO BE- TALK ABOUT THERE WAS CONCERNS- FROM ALL PARTIES AND OVER THE HOLIDAYS. THAT JEFF- BROUGHT SOME LANGUAGE TOGETHER THAT IS RESOLVED SOME OF THE ISSUES WERE HAPPY WITH ALL THE LANGUAGE WE APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT THIS COMMITTEE HAS PUT INTO IT AND WE HOPE THAT YOU'LL SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU WOULD ANYONE ELSE LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. RIGHT SEEING NONE IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- MY NAME IS ANNA BUCK ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS- WELL WE OPPOSE THE BILL IN PRINT OVER THE SPECIFICS OF THE INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS WERE HAVING PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AUTHOR IT'S OFFICE AND THE SPONSOR AND SHOULD THIS BILL MOVE FORWARD WE- HOPE TO CONTINUE THAT WORK THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE. IN OPPOSITION OR WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR. ALRIGHT SING NONE BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTION COMMENT SWITCHED OVER TO THE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SO ARE WE HEARD THIS BILL AND BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS LAST YEAR AND I VOTED FOR IT- YOU HAVE SINCE THEN ADDED THE REQUIREMENT FOR A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF INSURANCE SO ARE COULD YOU TALK ABOUT WHY THAT WAS ADDED AFTER IT'D GONE THROUGH OTHER COMMITTEES AND WHAT THE RATIONALE BEHIND THAT IS BECAUSE I KNOW THAT'S- THE ONE PROVISION THAT'S GOT THE STAKEHOLDERS VERY CONCERNED ABOUT IT. THANK YOU SIR IT WAS A SUGGESTION- I BELIEVE OF YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF. AND I'M OKAY WITH IT- IT HAS CREATED LITTLE CONSTERNATION WITH THE REALTORS. BUT I THINK WORK IN I BELIEVE WE CAN WORK THROUGH THESE ISSUES- I DON'T KNOW IF MATT WANTS TO COMMENT ON THE- ON THAT PROVISION. SURE THIS IS THE PROVISION THAT HAS HELD UP THIS BILL OVER THE YEARS- ON. MY OWN MEMBERS IN THE PAST HAVE HAD A LITTLE CONCERN WITH THIS WE OF COURSE WOULD LOVE TO BE ABLE TO FORM LLC'S WITH- OUT THE STATE REQUIRING HAVE ANY REPORTING OR ANY INSURANCE- BUT WE THINK WHAT'S BEEN PUT IN THE BILL IS REASONABLE. THEY WERE BUILT ON- SOME REQUIREMENTS THAT WERE IN A PART A BILL IN THE MID TWO THOUSANDS. AB WE WENT OUT AND CHECKED WITH OUR MEMBERSHIP ON THIS- WITH SOME COMPANIES YOU. CURRENTLY KERRY INSURANCE AS BEING A C. CORP- THE MINIMUMS THAT ARE CURRENTLY IN THE BILL WE FEEL ARE A VERY REACHABLE FOR MOST COMPANIES. THAT WOULD LOOK INTO DOING THIS. SO LET ME TOTAL DOWN ON SOMETHING THAT YOU JUST SAID SO- I UNDERSTAND THE ARGUMENT THAT. ALLOWING INCORPORATION AS AN LLC PROVIDES A LIABILITY SHIELD AND MAYBE THAT'S A REASON WHY INSURANCE WOULD BE APPROPRIATE- BUT- THESE TYPES OF BUSINESS CAN ALREADY INCORPORATE AS A C. CORPORATION- I WAS NOT AWARE THAT THERE ARE INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS FOR SEEK. FOR A IS SIMILAR CONSTITUTED SEE CORPORATIONS THAT- SO THAT COMPANIES THAT WE TALKED TO KERRY VOLUNTARY YOU KNOW INSURANCE. AND OTHER CURRENTLY SEE CORPSE WHO CARRY THAT INSURANCE AND THE COMPANIES THAT WE TALKED TO THAT AREN'T LARGE COMPANIES THERE- THERE. WAS AN ELEVEN PERSON BROKERAGE FIRM. IS VOLUNTARILY CARRYING RIGHT NOW IS THE C. CORP- AND AMOUNT OF INSURANCE THAT BASICALLY DOUBLES THE MINIMUMS- OF WHAT WOULD BE REQUIRED UNDER THIS BILL. OKAY SO THAT THIS IS GETTING TO THE HEART OF MY SKEPTICISM HERE SO WE ALREADY ALLOW THESE TYPES OF BUSINESSES. TO INCORPORATE AS A C. CORPORATION AND WE DO NOT REQUIRE THEM TO CARRY INSURANCE DESPITE THE FACT THAT THERE'S A LIABILITY SHIELD STOLE WHY THEN. IF WE'RE ADDING L. L. C.'S TO THE MIX OF ENTITIES THAT CAN FORM THIS BUSINESS WHAT WE REQUIRE INSURANCE OF THEM. AGAIN IT'S IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT THAT THIS IS AN EARLY OPTIONAL AS WELL. SO IT MAY BE BECAUSE OF THAT BURDEN THE COMPANIES DON'T MAKE THAT CHOICE. BUT THE ASSOCIATION HAS ASKED TO CREATE THIS MECHANISM STRICTLY AS AN OPTION. FOR BROKERS AND WE- ON THAT PREMISE OF BASED AND THE SMELL THE STAFF WANTED TO. WANTED TO WERE INCREASED INSURANCE REQUIREMENT. BUT IT AGAIN IT'S OPTIONAL SO BUT BUT SURE AS THE AUTHOR I'M NOT GONNA. DETER TOO MUCH I GUESS WE'LL SEE I MEAN IF THE BILL BECOMES LAW WE'LL SEE IF COMPANIES MAKE THIS CHOICE I DON'T MEAN TO. TO DISMISS YOUR CONCERN- AND I'M NOT DISMISSING IT. BUT IT M. IT IS WHAT IT IS IN THAT SENSE IF YOU KNOW WE WILL LEARN IF COMPANIES ONE COMPANY SCRUTINIZE THIS OPTION IT MAKES SENSE FOR THEM OR NOT BUT THERE'S NOTHING MANDATORY ABOUT CHOOSING THAT OPTION SURE I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND THAT'S WHY I SUPPORTED THE BILL AND BE IN P. LAST YEAR BECAUSE I THINK THE COMPANIES OUGHT TO HAVE THIS OPTION BUT I AM ONE HAPPY ABOUT THE FACT THAT THIS INSURANCE REQUIREMENT HAS BEEN ADDED TO THE LAST MINUTE AND IT MAKES NO SENSE TO ME GIVEN THAT. OTHER TYPES OF LIABILITY SHIELDING ENTITIES ARE ALLOWED TO PRACTICE THIS BUSINESS WITHOUT INSURANCE BUT- SO I WANNA MAKE MAXIMUM UTILITY OF THIS NEW TOOL THAT WE'RE GIVING THEM SO- I WOULD BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY BECAUSE I THINK I AGREE WITH YOU I THINK THEY OUGHT TO HAVE THIS TOOL BUT I'D LIKE TO ENCOURAGE YOU TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS BECAUSE I REALLY HOPE WE CAN GET OUR ARMS AROUND THIS INSURANCE ISSUES THE BILL FORWARD THANK YOU AND AS WAS PREVIOUSLY SAID THE REAL. HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT AS WELL AND SO IT'S- WE IN CONVERSATION ON THAT POINT THANK YOU WILL BE. QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. I THANK YOU THE END FOR TAKING A MOMENT I THINK THAT THE INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS ARE SOMETHING THAT ARE IMPORTANT HERE. C. CORPUS ESCORTS LIMITED LIABILITY CORPORATIONS ALL THAT ALL HAVE DIFFERENT. WAYS OF PROTECTING AGAINST LIABILITY AND HAVE DIFFERENT STANDARDS AND WAYS THAT. THEY THEY THEY CAN BE A SALE IF YOU WILL AND WHAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE IS THAT WE ARE NOT CREATING CORPORATION OR ALLOWING FOR INCORPORATION WHERE THERE IS NO. FUNCTIONAL WAY TO GO AFTER THE BAD ACTORS WHO HAVE CREATED THAT CORPORATION HAVE NOT CAPITALIZED IT AND HAVE NOT ALLOWED FOR. THE ANY OTHER WAY FOR SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN MISTREATED BY THAT CORPORATION BECAUSE CORPORATIONS ARE A LIMITS THE LIABILITY UNDER C. CORE DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS TYPICALLY DO GET INSURED. BECAUSE THEY CAN BE LIABLE FOR THEIR ACTIONS UNDER UNDER. WITH L. L. C. THERE'S SOME DIFFERENT STANDARDS AND I WILL ALSO NOTE HERE. THAT THERE ALSO ARE SOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS BECAUSE UNDER AN LLC THERE ARE TAX PASS THROUGHS. AS OPPOSED TO IT SEE CORPSE AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S BEYOND THE PURVIEW OF THIS COMMITTEE TO LOOK AT TO THAT'S NOT AN ISSUE THAT WE WANTED TO RACE BUT THAT MIGHT BE AN ISSUE FOR APPROPRIATIONS OR OTHER COMMITTEES TO BE ABLE TO TAKE A LOOK AT. GOT IT THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT SO WITH THAT MISTER DALY MAY CLOSE I RESPECTFULLY REQUESTAN AYE VOTE AND WILL CONTINUE WORKING ON THAT ISSUE AND ANYTHING ELSE THAT POPS UP. THANK YOU. SO.

UNDER THE MSA- THAT PROVIDE FOR SUBSTANTIAL ANNUAL PAYMENTS TO OUR STATE IN THESE PAYMENTS ARE PROVIDED IN PERPETUITY AND HAVE EXCEEDED SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION IN RECENT YEARS THESE ANNUAL PAYMENTS- ARE CONDITIONED ON CALIFORNIA'S ENFORCEMENT AND THE DILIGENT ENFORCEMENT AT THAT OF AN ESCROW STATUTE- AND- IMPOSES- A SIMILAR A FINANCIAL OBLIGATION UNDER- ARE ON. THE TOBACCO COMPANIES THAT ARE NOT A PARTY TO THE MSA SO HERE IN CALIFORNIA IF WE FAIL TO ENFORCE THIS ASCO STATUTE IN A GIVEN YEAR IT RISKS THE LOSS OF SOME AND POTENTIALLY ALL OF ITS ANGLE- ALLOTMENT YOU KNOW THESE OF THE PAYMENTS AND SO THIS BILL WOULD CERTAINLY CLARIFY EXISTING LAW EIGHT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S. FORCE MEANT OF OUR STATE MSA. END THE NSA'S OBLIGATIONS BY MAKING SURE THAT WE TARGET NON COMPLIANT AT ACTORS AND SHARING THAT DATA WITH. AGENCIES APARTMENT PURPOSES.

AND REQUIRED TO POSTED SHORTY BOND AND INCREASED COORDINATION WITH OTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCIES FOR DILIP DILIGENT ENFORCEMENT AS PART OF THE MSA DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCESS.

AT THE SUPREME COURT PASSED ALONG RIGHT LANDMARK DECISION FORTY SEVEN YEARS AGO AFFIRMING EVERY WOMAN HAS A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO CONTROL HER OWN REPRODUCTIVE DECISIONS AND WHETHER TO CONTINUE A PREGNANCY OR OBTAIN AN ABORTION. ROE V. WADE WAS A VICTORY FOR WOMEN TO OWN THEIR OWN BODIES AND LAID THE GROUNDWORK FOR FURTHER REPRODUCTIVE AND SEXUAL HEALTH CARE POLICY THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY HOUSE RESOLUTION SIXTY NINE CONTINUES THE ASSEMBLY SUPPORT AND COMMITMENT TO PROTECT A PERSON'S FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO DECIDE IF AND WHEN THEY BECOME APPARENT. THE PROTECTIONS GRANTED BY ROE V. WADE ARE AT THE HIGHEST RISK OF BEING OVERTURNED. I LIKE MANY OF YOU STAND IN STRONG SUPPORT OF WOMEN'S FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT AS CONFIRMED IN ROE V. WADE TO MAKE HER OWN DECISIONS REGARDING HER PREGNANCY AND URGE YOU TO VOTE HI ON HR SIXTY NINE WITH ME TODAY I HAVE MOLLY ROBSON- WITH PLANNED PARENTHOOD AND- SHANNON HOVIS WITH NARAL PRO CHOICE AMERICA. TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE MAY HAVE. THANK YOU FIRST WITNESS PLEASE. GOOD MORNING SHARON MEMBERS MY NAME IS SHANNON HOW VESTS AND I'M THE DIRECTOR FOR NARAL PRO CHOICE CALIFORNIA. NARAL IS THE OLDEST AND LARGEST ABORTION RIGHTS ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION IN THE COUNTRY. WITH TWO POINT FIVE MILLION MEMBERS NATIONALLY AND TWO HUNDRED FORTY FIVE THOUSAND MEMBERS HERE IN CALIFORNIA. FORTY SEVEN YEARS AGO ROBBIE WADE GAVE WOMEN THE ABILITY TO CONTROL THEIR OWN REPRODUCTIVE DESTINIES. A RIGHT THAT IS ESSENTIAL TO WOMEN BEING EQUAL MEMBERS OF OUR SOCIETY. THE ANNIVERSARY OF ROE SHOULD BE A CELEBRATION. FOR THE PROGRESS OF OUR COUNTRY AND YET THE FORTY SEVENTH ANNIVERSARY SOMBER THIS LANDMARK SUPREME COURT DECISION IS ON THE LINE LIKE NEVER BEFORE. IN MARCH THE COURT WILL WHO WILL HEAR ARGUMENTS IN JUNE MEDICAL SERVICES VICKY. THE FIRST MAJOR CHALLENGE TO ABORTION ACCESS AND SPREAD CABINETS CONFIRMATION. THE CASE WHICH CONCERNS A LAW IDENTICAL TO A TEXAS LAW THAT THE SUPREME COURT STRUCK DOWN JUST FOUR YEARS AGO IT'S FURTHER PROOF THAT DONALD TRUMP IS PAID BACK HIS DEBTS TO THE ANTI CHOICE EXTREMISTS THE PUT HIM IN OFFICE. SINCE KAVANAUGH'S CONFIRMATION AN EMBOLDENED ANTI CHOICE MOVEMENT HAS UNLEASHED UNPRECEDENTED AN UNPRECEDENTED WAVE OF ABORTION BANS WITH THE SPECIFIC INTENT OF GETTING A CASE TO THE SUPREME COURT TO AND FRO. EARLIER THIS MONTH TWO HUNDRED AND SEVEN ANTI CHOICE LAWMAKERS IN CONGRESS SIGNED ONTO AN AMICUS BRIEF URGING THE COURT TO RECONSIDER ROUTE. IT IS NO SURPRISE THAT JUST FIFTEEN OF THE THOSE CONGRESS MEMBERS ARE WOMEN. WE MAY NOT KNOW THE FUTURE. WHAT THE FUTURE HOLDS FOR ROW. BUT WE DO KNOW THAT SUPPORT FOR THE RIGHT TO ACCESSIBLE XIN IS MORE POPULAR THAN EVER. PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR ROE V. WADE IS AT AN ALL TIME HIGH. 77% OF AMERICANS SUPPORT THE SUPREMES SUPREME COURT DECISION. THAT'S NOT JUST MAJORITY IT'S A CONSENSUS. ROW IS A LANDMARK DECISION ONE OF THE MOST VALUED IN OUR NATION'S HISTORY. ROW IS A FUNDAMENTAL PART OF WHO WE ARE AS A COUNTRY. UNDERSCORING THE BASIC PRINCIPLE THAT WOMEN CANNOT BE EQUAL PARTNERS IN OUR SOCIETY WITHOUT THE ABILITY TO MAKE PERSONAL DECISIONS ABOUT THEIR OWN BODIES AND FUTURES. ON BEHALF OF NAY ROW I THANK ASSEMBLY WOMANLY MON. FOR BRINGING FORTH THIS RESOLUTION AND I'M GRATEFUL TO THE LEGISLATURE FOR FIGHTING TO PROTECT AND ITS ETHNIC AND EXPAND REP REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM FOR ALL. I RESPECTFULLY URGE YOUR SUPPORT THIS RESOLUTION. THANK YOU THAT'S WITH US PLEASE. GOOD MORNING FAIR MEMBERS I MAILLET RICKSON LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE FOR PLANNED PARENTHOOD AFFILIATES OF CALIFORNIA OF REPRESENTING SEVEN AFFILIATES. WHO PROVIDE HEALTHCARE OVER SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND PATIENTS THEIR HUNDRED EIGHT HEALTH CENTERS IN THE STATE. I WANNA HANG ASSEMBLY MEMBER LOW MOAN FOR HER LEADERSHIP OFFERING THIS RESOLUTION TO CELEBRATE THE FORTY SEVEN THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE HISTORIC ROE V. WADE DECISION WHICH PROTECTS THE RIGHT NOW ACCESS TO SAFE LEGAL ABORTION. WHILE WE CELEBRATE THE TH ANNIVERSARY WE MUST ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE RIGHT TO SAFE LEGAL ABORTION IS UNDER ASSAULT AS SHANNON MENTIONED. OVER THREE HUNDRED ABORTION RESTRICTIONS WERE. INTRODUCED BY EXTREMIST POLITICIANS. IN TWENTY NINETEEN ALL AIMED AT ELIMINATING ACCESS AND STRIPPING AWAY FREEDOM FROM PREGNANT PEOPLE. AND AS CNN MENTIONED THE SUPREME COURT WILL HEAR CASE THAT COULD UNDO THE PRODUCTIONS GRANTED BY ROE V. WADE. THIS YEAR. WE ARE FORTUNATE IN CALIFORNIA TO HAVE LEADERS WHO STAND WITH PLANNED PARENTHOOD AND UNDERSTAND THAT ABORTION CARE IS HEALTHCARE. AND HEALTH CARE IS A HUMAN RIGHT. AND WE THINK THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE FOR CONTINUING TO EXPAND NOT BAD ACCESS TO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH AND SAFE LEGAL ABORTION. WE ARE ALSO THANK YOU ALL FOR BRINGING AWARENESS THROUGH THIS RESOLUTION AND FOR THESE REASONS ARE PROUD TO SUPPORT. HR SIXTY NINE AND ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU WOULD ANYONE ELSE LIKE TO REGISTER SUPPORT. TO BECOME A TO THE MICROPHONE. ALL RIGHT SEEING NONE IS THERE OPPOSITION REMEMBERS MY NAME IS GREG BIRCH WITH THE CALIFORNIA FAMILY COUNCIL. I'M SURE YOU REALIZE WITH THE RECENT CHANGES IN THE SUPREME COURT THAT ROE VERSUS WADE DECISION IS ON LIFE SUPPORT. BUT I ALSO BELIEVE PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR ABORTION IS IN A PREPARE PRECARIOUS SITUATION BECAUSE THE MORAL REASONING USED TO JUSTIFY IT IS BEING EXPOSED. ABORTION IS ONLY SURVIVED THIS LONG BECAUSE PROPONENTS WERE ABLE TO DECEIVE PEOPLE ABOUT THE BRUTAL REALITY OF THE PRACTICE JUST LISTEN TO THE WAY ABORTION RIGHTS ADVOCATES TALK ABOUT THE PROCEDURE. DO YOU HEAR THE LANGUAGE OF NASTY EXCUSE TO DISTRACT PEOPLE AWAY FROM THINKING ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS DURING AN ABORTION WHY DID THEY DO THAT WHY CAN'T THEY TALK ABOUT ABORTION IN PLAIN EXACTING LANGUAGE. I THINK YOU KNOW THE ANSWER. YET DISTRACTING PEOPLE FROM OR AT THE REALITY OF ABORTION HAS BECOME NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE WITH ADVANCES IN ULTRASOUND TECHNOLOGY. I HAVE THREE KIDS AND I REMEMBER BEING INTRODUCED TO MY CHILDREN THROUGH AN ULTRASOUND MACHINE. I SAW MY DAUGHTER'S HEART BEATING AND MY SON'S ARMS AND LEGS IN MOTION JUST A FEW MONTHS AFTER CONCEPTION. AND IT WAS AN INCREDIBLE UNBELIEVABLE EXPERIENCE FOR A NEW FATHER. SO WHEN I THINK ABOUT WHAT ABORTION REALLY IS I RECALL THOSE FLICKERING ULTRASOUND PICTURES AND I THINK OF UNBORN CHILDREN JUST LIKE MY OWN. GETTING THEIR LITTLE LIMBS TORN OFF BY AN ABORTIONIST. THE HORROR. OF IT CAN HARDLY BE EXPRESSED AND I THINK HOW CAN INTELLIGENCE IN OTHERWISE VERY NICE AND GOOD HEARTED PEOPLE JUSTIFY THIS. MY TRUTH REVEALING EXPERIENCE WITH THE ULTRASOUND MACHINE IS REPEATED THOUSANDS OF TIMES A DAY. AND THIS TRUTH TELLING TECHNOLOGY IS CHANGING HEARTS MINDS AND CONVINCING MANY HARDENED PRO ABORTION RIGHTS ADVOCATES THAT NOTHING JUSTIFIES THE BARBARIC PRACTICE. I'M HERE TODAY TO REMIND YOU OF THE CRUEL REALITY YORK CELEBRATING IN HOPES THAT ONE DAY. THE GOD WILL OPEN YOUR EYES IN TURN YOU INTO A PRO LIFE ADVOCATE AS HE HAS DONE WITH MILLIONS OF OTHERS THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WITH US PLEASE GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS ONE THAT SELLS AND I SERVICE THE DIRECTOR OF CALIFORNIANS FOR LIFE RECENTLY OUR GOVERNOR ANNOUNCED THAT CALIFORNIA WILL BECOME A NO KILL. NO KILL STATE WHEN IT COMES TO SO CALLED UNWANTED DOGS AND CATS OUR BELOVED PETS. GET HERE THIS RESOLUTION SIX TO CELEBRATE THE KILLING OF OVER SIXTY MILLION HUMAN BEINGS AND HURTING MILLIONS OF WOMEN FOR A LIFETIME. BUT THE IRONY SINK IN FOR A MOMENT. BEFORE YOU VOTE ON THIS RESOLUTION KEEP IN MIND THAT THE JANE ROE OF THE ROE V. WADE DECISION WAS A REAL WOMAN. HER NAME WAS NORMA MCCORVEY. SHE WENT ON TO WRITE A BOOK TO DESCRIBE HOW THE ABORTION INDUSTRY HOUSTON MISTREATED HER. SHE LATER WENT ON IN HER LIFE TO HAVE A COMPLETE CONVERSION TO BECOME A PRO LIFE LEADER. IF SHE WERE ALIVE TODAY SHOULD BE COMPLETELY APPALLED. AT THIS RESOLUTION AND I QUOTE HER AS SAYING. KEEP IN MIND SHE'S THE CENTER OF THE ROE V. WADE THIS DECISION NORMA MCCORVEY SAID QUOTE YOU ARE TOTALLY DIFFERENT AFTER YOU'VE HAD AN ABORTION ABORTION KINDA SUCKS YOUR SOUL DRY IT MAKE SURE VERY ANGRY PERSON INSIDE FROM WHAT I HAVE SEEN. AND SHE SAW A LOT OF ABORTIONS SHE WAS AN ABORTION CLINIC MANAGER SIMILARLY DOCTOR BERNARD NATHANSON BUT FOUNDER OF NAY WRONG HOW TO COMPLETE CONVERSION IT WAS A FORMER ABORTIONIST BUT DEEPLY REGRETTED HIS INVOLVEMENT IN THE ABORTION INDUSTRY. KILLING THE MOST VULNERABLE AMONG US THE WEEK THE VOICE WAS THE AND QUOTE IN PERFECT THE QUOTE AND WANTED. IS A LEAGUE FOR HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATION THAT AFFECTS ALL OF THIS. AB GIRLS ARE BEING KILLED JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE GIRLS IS THAT SOMETHING TO CELEBRATE TODAY. 90% OF BABIES IDENTIFIED WITH DOWN SYNDROME ARE KILLED HERE IN OUR COUNTRY AND IN SOME COUNTRIES EVEN ELIMINATED ENTIRELY ERADICATED ON THE VERGE OF EXTINCTION. BECAUSE OF ABORTION IS THAT SOMETHING TO CELEBRATE. POOR BABY SOME PAPERS OF COLOR ARE BEING KILLED BY ABORTION IN DISPROPORTIONATE RATES WE DON'T SOLVE POVERTY MY FRIENDS BY KILLING POOR CHILDREN. WHERE IS THE VOICE FOR THE VOICELESS THE OPPRESSED AND MARGINALIZED WE HAVE A DREAM ON THE OTHER HAND WHAT WOMEN CAN SUCCEED WITHOUT HAVING TO KILL OUR CHILDREN WE HAVE A DREAM WHERE WE CAN ALL WORK TOGETHER EVERYONE IN THIS BUILDING TO HELP MAKE SURE THAT WOMEN HAVE THE RESOURCES AND SUPPORT THEY NEED WHEN FACING THE CHALLENGES ARE UNEXPECTED PREGNANCY. SO ABORTION SOMEDAY WILL BECOME UNTHINKABLE. WE INVITE YOU TO SHARE IN THAT DREAM AS INCREASING NUMBERS OF CALIFORNIANS REJECT ABORTION. RECENTLY THE SOCK WILL BE REPORTED THAT ABORTION RATES HERE IN CALIFORNIA. HOW FOLLOWED BY MORE THAN 60% SINCE THE EARLY NINETEEN NINETIES. ABORTION IS GOING BY THE WAYSIDE MY FRIENDS. AND MAKE CALIFORNIA SOME DAY SOON BECOME A NO KILL STATE. ABORTION IS NOT SOMETHING TO CELEBRATE WE URGE YOU TO VOTE NO ON THIS RESOLUTION THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND WHAT ELSE LIKE TO REGISTER OPPOSITION. TO THIS MEASURE ALL RIGHT SIGNAL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS. ALRIGHT SYNONYMOUS THE MONUMENT CLOSE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU SO THIS IS H. R. SIXTY NINE THE MOTION THAT I'M LOOKING FOR IS THAT THE RESOLUTION BE ADOPTED. WAIT AS BUT IS THERE SECONDS. AND SECOND AND THANK YOU KALRA PLEASE. STONE BY STONE HI GALLAGHER GALLAGHER NOW SHALL. CHIU GONZALEZ GONZALEZ I HOLDEN HOLDEN AYE KALRA. KALRA AYE KILEY KILEY NOW MAIENSCHEIN MAIENSCHEIN AYE OBERNOLTE OBERNOLTE NOW REYES REYES AYE. THANK YOU THAT RESOLUTION WAS ADOPTED BY THIS COMMITTEE. ALRIGHT MS WICKS OUR ITEM NUMBER FOUR AB SEVENTEEN TWELFTH FOG OF THE MORNING MISTER CHAIR% AND MEMBERS. AB SEVENTEEN TWELVE IS A MODEST TRANSPARENCY BILL THAT WILL SHED LIGHT ON DONOR ADVISED FUNDS OR DAFT AS THEY'RE CALLED A GROWING SEGMENT IN CHARITABLE GIVING DEATHS ALLOWED HONOR TO ESTABLISH AN ACCOUNT TO WHICH HE OR SHE CAN MAKE A TAX DEDUCTIBLE. CONTRIBUTION TO A CHARITABLE SPONSOR. THE DONOR. AND GRANTS FROM HIS OR HER FUND TO OTHER CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS THAT PROVIDE DIRECT PUBLIC BENEFIT THROUGH COMMUNITY SERVICES PROGRAMS ARE ADVOCACY. THE BEST SOUND AFTER THOSE AFFILIATED WITH COMMERCIAL INVESTMENT FIRMS LIKE FIDELITY SCHWAB VANGUARD AND OTHERS. BUT ALSO INCLUDE FOUNDATIONS UNIVERSITIES AND OTHERS. NATIONALLY DAFT'S ADOPT ACCOUNTS HOLD ABOUT A HUNDRED AND TEN BILLION DOLLARS AND DON'T DONATED. A TURTLE ASSET OF WHICH SEVENTEEN BILLION IS HELD IN DEATH SPONSORED ORGANIZATIONS HEADQUARTERED HERE IN CALIFORNIA. I PROPOSE THIS BILL TO ADDRESS CONCERNS THAT WERE HIGHLIGHTED IN A RECENT REPORT FROM THE US GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE. NAMELY DORMANT VERSIONS OF A LACK OF PUBLIC BENEFIT AND IMPROPER DONOR CONTROL. DOZENS OF NON PROFITS FROM ON CALIFORNIA ECHO THESE CONCERNS. AS THEY GRAPPLE WITH MAKING. IT NEEDS OF THEIR COMMUNITY I WATCHED FUND GROWING. AS IT VISUALS GIVING TO. READING CHAIR FALL WITH AN ESTIMATED THREE HUNDRED MILLION. EXPENDITURES GOING TO TERRIBLE TAX DEDUCTIONS CLAIMED FOR DEATH CONTRIBUTIONS THE STATE HAS A COMPELLING INTEREST IN BETTER UNDERSTANDING THE FLOW AND TIMING ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH THE OFFICE. THE DONORS CAN CLAIM A TAX DEDUCTION AS SOON AS THEY CONTRIBUTE MONEY STOCKS OR OTHER ASSETS TO DRAFT THE FUNDS CAN SIT INDEFINITELY WITHOUT PROVIDING ANY PUBLIC CHARITABLE BENEFITS. WELL THE OPPONENTS OF THIS BILL ARGUED DONATIONS MEANT FOR THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT DO NOT SIT DEATH ACCOUNTS THERE IS NO FUN LEVEL THAT IT TO SUBSTANTIATE. THIS ASSERTION. AB SEVENTEEN TWELVE DOES NOT PRESUME TO KNOW WHAT POLICY REFORMS MAY BE WARRANTED. MY GOAL WITH AB SEVENTEEN TWELVE IS TO SIMPLY LEARN MORE. AS SUCH THE BILL ADDRESSES A GAP IN TRANSPARENCY BY REQUIRING THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO ADOPT RULES THAT REQUIRE CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS TO DISCLOSE KEY INFORMATION ABOUT THE INDIVIDUAL DEATH ACCOUNT THEY MANAGE. AMENDMENTS TAKEN ON JANUARY SIXTH REQUIRE ANONYMITY FOR DONORS BY PROVIDING THE DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION IDENTIFIES OR DESCRIBES INDIVIDUAL DONORS INCLUDING THEIR NAMES SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS ACCOUNT NUMBERS AND CONTACT INFORMATION. PRIVACY I'VE SOMEONE WHO'S RUN SOME PRETTY OF AMBITIOUS PRIVACY BILLS PRIVACY IS IT AN ISSUE I CARE ABOUT AND WE'RE WORKING VERY HARD TO MAKE SURE THIS PRIVACY IS PROTECTED. THE LAST NAME AND ALSO ADDRESS ITS CONCERNS BY THE OPPOSITION ABOUT THE POTENTIAL ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN THAT OME DEAF SPONSOR ORGANIZATIONS MAY FACE BY EXEMPTING. THOSE WITH LESS THAN THREE HUNDRED MILLION AND DEATH ASSETS FROM THE BILL. WITHOUT PROPER OVERSIGHT WHICH PROVIDES EVIDENCE THAT THE CHURCH WILL FUNDS AND APPS ARE MAKING IT OUT TO OUR COMMUNITIES. ARE COMMUNITIES COULD BE MISSING OUT TWICE. THEY MISS OUT WHEN THE STATE HAS LESS GENERAL FUND MONEY TO FUND THINGS LIKE PUBLIC EDUCATION HEALTH CARE AND THINGS OF THIS NATURE. AND OUR COMMUNITIES COULD BE MISSING OUT A SECOND TIME WHEN THE ORGANIZATIONS TO WHICH THEY TURN TO FOR HELP ARE UNABLE TO SERVE THEM BECAUSE THE RESOURCES THEY NEED. ARE SITTING IN A DORMANT DEATH ACCOUNT. BY REQUIRING A LATER OF DISCLOSURE THAT PROTECTS DONORS ANONYMITY. AB AT TWELVE SEVENTEEN TWELVE WILL PROVIDE IMPORTANT CHARITABLE GIVING DATA TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND SHED LIGHT ON THIS INCREASING POPULAR. UNREGULATED PRACTICE. I NOW HAVE TWO GREAT- WITNESSES HERE AND I'M GONNA LOVE THEM TO- TO SELF INTRODUCED AND I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU FIRST WITNESS PLEASE. THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBERS STONE AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. I'M JAN MUSKOKA CEO OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF NON PROFITS A STATEWIDE ALLIANCE OF MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS. THESE ISSUES ABOUT DONOR ADVISED FUNDS WERE BROUGHT TO US BY OUR MEMBERS. THERE ARE MANY NONPROFITS ARE UNHAPPY ABOUT DONOR ADVISED pAND IT'S NOT HARD TO SEE WHY. AS THEY WORK WITH DESPERATELY POOR FAMILIES AND ON URGENT CIVIL RIGHTS AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS THE STAIN NONPROFITS CAN'T HELP BUT FEEL FRUSTRATED. WHEN THEY SEE BILLIONS OF CHARITABLE DOLLARS. FOR WHICH PEOPLE HAVE GOTTEN TAX DEDUCTIONS. SITTING AND DONOR ADVISED FUNDS. NATIONAL IN CALIFORNIA PRESS HAVE REPORTED ON DONOR ADVISED FUNDS BEING USED TO STOCK MONEY VEHICLES AS TAPS TAX LOOPHOLES FOR BILLIONAIRES. AND USE FOR PERSONAL FINANCIAL BENEFIT THROUGH FUND HOLDERS CONTROLLING HOW THEIR DONOR ADVISED FUNDS ARE INVESTED. IN CALIFORNIA THERE ARE FEWER THAN TWO HUNDRED. INSTITUTIONS THAT SPONSORED DONOR ADVISED FUNDS BUT THEY HOLD A REMARKABLE ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION. INSURABLE FUNDS. EACH YEAR IS ASSEMBLY MEMBER WORKS NOTED THE- STATE OF CALIFORNIA SPENDS THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN TAX. MANAGER THE DOT PEOPLE ON THE ON THE NATION'S TO DONOR ADVISED FUNDS BUT WHEN WE STARTED TO LOOK FOR MORE DATA ABOUT DONOR ADVISED FUNDS WE COULD FIND SO LITTLE INFORMATION ABOUT THEM THAT WE COULDN'T EVEN TELL WHETHER REGULATION WAS NECESSARY OR IF SO WHAT IT WOULD LOOK LIKE SO THIS BILL ASKED FOR EACH DONOR ADVISED FUND VERY SIMPLE INFORMATION HOW MUCH CAME INTO THE FUND HOW MUCH WENT OUT AND HOW MUCH WAS SPENT IN INVESTMENT AND MANAGEMENT FEES THAT'S IT. THE BILL DOES NOT CALL FOR ANY MANDATORY PAYOUTS IT PROTECTS DONOR ANONYMITY IT LOOKS ONLY AT THE LARGEST STAFF SPONSORS THEREBY EXEMPTING VIRTUALLY ALL COMMUNITY FOUNDATIONS I WANT TO ADDRESS TO SPECIFIC CONCERNS RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION FIRST AS DONOR ANONYMITY THIRTY EIGHT SIMPLE WAYS TO PROTECT DONOR ANONYMITY. I IS TO. HAVE THEM REPORT ON EACH FINE BUT IN A CODED NUMBER FOR EACH FIND RATHER THAN THE DONOROR THE CONTROLLER OF THE FUN. THE SECOND ONE IS TO USE THE SAME SYSTEM THAT IS CURRENTLY IN PLACE FOR DECADES WITH THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL USING ON SCHEDULE BE. A FORM THAT CALIFORNIA NON PROFITS ARE REQUIRED TO FILE WITH THE NAMES AND ADDRESSES OF OUR DONORS BUT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL HOLDS MINUTES NOT DISCLOSED TO THE PUBLIC. SO THERE ARE TWO. WAYS BOTH OF THEM AND EXTENSIVE USE ALREADY. SECOND CONCERN IS WHY ADVOCATE PAYMENT ISN'T ADEQUATE RECORDING THIS ENOUGH. LET'S SUPPOSE THAT THERE CAN MILLION PEOPLE TEN PEOPLE SORRY TEN PEOPLE ON H. BUT ONE MILLION DOLLARS INTO A DONOR ADVISED PLAN. TWO OF THEM GIVE OUT THERE SAY MILLION IN THE SAME YEAR SO THAT MEANS THE DEATH SPONSOR COULD REPORT TO PAY OUT RATE OF TWENTY PERCENT. BUT EIGHT OF THOSE FUNDS DID NOT DISPERSE ANY MONEY AT ALL. AND IF THOSETWO PEOPLE ACTUALLY MOVE THEM TO A DIFFERENT DOT ORG VICE FUND. WOULD ACTUALLY NOTHING WITHOUT WE GOT OUT TO COMMIT DESPITE. THAT IT WOULD LOOK LIKE THERE WERE STILL THE SAME 20% FULL OF ACTIVITY. THIS WILL BE. THE DAY WILL ALLOW. PLAYERS THEM STRAIGHT THEY ARE DOING THINGS RIGHT NOT JUST ASSERT THAT THEY ARE. AND IT WILL DROP BACK THE CURTAIN ON THE LARGEST FUNDS AND HOW THOSE FUNDS ARE DEPLOYED. IF THEY ARE JUST SITTING THERE OR IF THEY ARE SIMPLY BEING TRANSFERRED AMONG VARIOUS DONOR ADVISED FUNDS. MAKING IT APPEAR THAT THERE IS REAL ACTIVITY. MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED CALIFORNIA WRAP UP PLEASE THANK YOU MORE THAN ONE FOR CALIFORNIA NON PROFITS OF COURAGEOUSLY SIGNED ON TO SUPPORT THIS. MOST OF THEM THINK WE ARE NOT GOING FAR ENOUGH BUT WE WANT TO BE SURE WITH WITH THE ITEM THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. THANK YOU CHAIR STONING COMMITTEE MEMBERS I'M PIEDMONT SO PRESIDENT OF UNITED WAS APPOINTED A STATEWIDE NETWORK FOR CAL UNITED WEAPONS. UNITED WAYS BILL OPPORTUNITIES FOR LOW INCOME WORKING FAMILIES. TO MOVE UP BY FOCUSING ON THE THREE KEY BUILDING BLOCKS. OF THE GOOD LIFE EDUCATION INCOME AND HEALTH ANNUALLY CALIFORNIA'S UNITED RAISE. RAISE ABOUT TWO MILLION DOLLARS EACH YEAR IN INVEST THAT BACK IN OUR COMMUNITIES. BECAUSE MOST OF OUR DONORS GIVE TO REPLACE AND PAINTINGS ARE AVERAGE. AS THREE FIFTY DOLLARS. I MEAN I ALWAYS PUT THEIR WORK TYPICALLY WITHIN TWELVE TO EIGHTEEN MONTHS OF RAISING THEM. THAT'S BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT THE PRINCIPLE OF THE TIME VALUE OF MONEY MEANS CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTIONS CAN HAVE GREATER IMPACT IF PUT TO WORK. MORE QUICKLY RATHER THAN HELD AND SPENT OVER YEARS AND DECADES. WE PARTNER CLOSELY WITH OCAL COMMUNITY FOUNDATIONS AROUND THE STATE. AND WE KNOW OUR COMMUNITY FOUNDATION FRIENDS RELY MORE HEAVILY ON DEATH'S DOOR VICE FUNDS THAN WE DO. BUT WE ALSO USED OR VICE FUNDS IN MANY CASES. ABOUT FIFTEEN OUR WAYS ACROSS THE COUNTRY SPONSORED DONOR VICE FUNDS. IN SUPPORTING AB SEVENTEEN TWELVE WE'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE TRANSPARENCY THAT CAN. UP PROTECT THE GOOD WORK WE'RE ALL DOING AND INCREASED AVAILABILITY OF TERRIBLE FUNDS FOR OUR COMMUNITIES. CRITICS EVERY SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT DOOR VICE FUNDS INCLUDING THAT THE AUDITORS TO GET A FULL THE- DIRECTION UP FRONT. AND THEN THE TERRIBLE- BENEFIT DOESN'T HAPPEN FOR YEARS LATER. AVOID PREP PRIVATE FOUNDATION RULES THAT REQUIRE- A MINIMUM AMOUNT BE SPENT- GIVE TAX BENEFITS. OF FOR SPENDING THE BENEFITS THE DONORS THEMSELVES. HAIDAR MAKE UNSCRUPULOUS ABOUT COUNTRY CONTRIBUTIONS TO NONPROFITS SUCH AS- HATE GROUPS A PARTISAN POLITICAL PURPOSES- AND OTHERWISE- SPEND FUNDS THAT WOULD BE BETTER SPENT ON THE COMMON GOOD CUNY FOUNDATIONS UNITED WAYS AND OTHER LOCAL CHARITIES THAT USED TO REVISE FUNDS. HAVE CLEAR PHILANTHROPIC GOALS BOARDS AND LEADERSHIP THAT LIVE IN AND ARE AT LEAST SOMEWHAT ACCESSIBLE TO AND RESPONSIVE TO LOCAL COMMUNITIES. BUT TODAY TWO DOLLARS OF EVERY THREE THEY GO TO DURING VICE FUNDS GO TO VERY LARGE COMMERCIAL FUNDS MOSTLY AFFILIATED WITH FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT COMPANIES LIKE FIDELITY. VANGUARD SWAB GOLDMAN SACHS AND OTHERS THAT ARE NOT SO ACCESSIBLE OR VISIBLE COMMUNITIES. I'M IT BACK IN THE MID TWO THOUSANDS COMMUNITY FOUNDATIONS AND OTHER ADVICE FUNDS WERE ROUGHLY. EVEN ABOUT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IN ANNUAL- INCOME NOWADAYS- TWENTY NINETEEN OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN- COMMERCIAL DONOR ADVISED FUNDS RAISED TWENTY THREE BILLION. NEARLY THREE TIMES AS MUCH AS COMMUNITY FOUNDATIONS THIS BILL PROTECT ANONYMITY FOR DONORS DOES NOT MANDATE A RATE OF PAY OUT. AND SIMPLY ASK THE STORE VICE FUND REPORT HOW MUCH CAME IN. HOW MUCH WENT OUT INTO WHERE AND HOW MUCH WAS PAID A MANAGEMENT AND INVESTMENT FEES. THAT SOUNDS SIMPLY LIKE GOOD CITIZENSHIP AND STEWARDSHIP OF TERRIBLE FUNDS TO US. WE KNOW WELL THE CHALLENGES THAT FACE OUR COMMUNITIES FROM HOMELESSNESS AND FOOD AND SECURITY TO RECOVERY FROM FIRES AND OTHERS AS NATURAL DISASTERS. THESE ARE URGENT NEEDS THAT THE MAN CHARITABLE DOLLARS SUPPORTED BY TAX DEDUCTIONS. BE SPENT AS WISELY AND EFFICIENTLY AS POSSIBLE AND IN OUR VIEW DO THE MOST GOOD FOR THE PEOPLE WITH THE GREATEST NAY. PLEASE VOTE YES ON AB SEVENTEEN TWELVE TO ASSURE THAT CHURCH WILL GIVING THREE DONOR ADVISED. BECAUSE MORE TRANSPARENT AND ACCOUNTABLE TO THE TRUE PURPOSE OF CHAIR AND TERRIBLE PRODUCTION THANK. YOU. BUT THIS RAISES YOUR MISTER DRUM IN THE HOUSE. I YEAH I TYPICALLY ALLOW THREE WITNESSES IN HIS REYES HAD MENTIONED THAT YOU WOULD WANT TO MAKE A STATEMENT. IN SUPPORT YOU'RE WELCOME TO. HI OF MONEY FROM AND- I WAS THE FOUNDER OF THE TIDES FOUNDATION BEGINNING IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX THAT- BUILT A DONOR ADVISED FUND BUSINESS OF SCALE- I AM IN SUPPORT OF THIS LEGISLATION IS ACTUALLY. WELL OVERDUE. PRIMARILY BECAUSE THE WAY THE FEEL HAS EVOLVED OVER THE YEARS HAS UNDERMINED THE CENTRAL PREMISE OF THE NINETEEN SIXTY NINE TAX REFORM ACT WHICH CREATED THE STRUCTURE. IN WHICH NON PROFITS EXIST THAT DIFFERENTIATED BETWEEN OPERATING CHARITIES ARE PUBLIC CHARITIES AND PRIVATE FOUNDATIONS DIFFERENT TAX BENEFITS FOR THE FORMER- INCREASED TAX BENEFITS FOR THE FORMER. OF THE WEIGHT HONORED VICE FUNDS HAVE OPERATED. AS A PUBLIC CHARITIES THEY SIMPLY ARE LESS ACCOUNTABLE YOU CAN'T SEE INTO THE ACTIVITIES OF THE FOUNDATIONS- SECOND. THE EVOLUTION OF THE COMMERCIAL FUNDS AS WE CALL THEM REALLY ARE CAPTIVE CHARITIES OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND THEY CONSTITUTE IN MY VIEW ESSENTIALLY AN ASSET ACCUMULATION STRATEGY. AT WITH VERY LITTLE COMMITMENT TO WERE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE FIELD ITSELF IF YOU LOOK AT HOW THEY'RE MANAGED OR THE INFORMATION PROVIDED ON THE WEBSITES OR ANYTHING ELSE. THIRDLY I WOULD. OPPOSE THE EXCEPTIONS THAT ARE IN THE AMENDMENT THAT YOU HAVE IN FRONT OF YOU I BELIEVE- TO ACCEPT SMALLER COMMUNITY FOUNDATIONS AND DONORS VICE FUND SPONSORS FROM THIS ACCOUNTABILITY OR TRANSPARENCY BASICALLY ANY DONOR ADVISED FUND. SPONSOR DOES FUND BY FUND ACCOUNTING IT'S ESSENTIAL IT'S THE WAY YOU PROVIDE SERVICES TO THE DONORS IN THAT HAVE MADE CONTRIBUTIONS AND CREATED FUNDS. GIVING THAT INFORMATION WITH APPROPRIATE ANONYMITY PROTECTIONS- IS THE SHOULD BE SEAMLESS IT SHOULD NOT BE A BURDEN FOR ANYBODY DOING THIS KIND OF ACTIVITY- SO I WOULD OPPOSE THAT PARTICULAR EXCEPTION BUT REALLY ENCOURAGE YOUR SUPPORT FOR THE LEGISLATION BECAUSE IT WILL OPEN THE DOOR. TO AN UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THESE DONOR ADVISED FUND SPONSORS TRULY OPERATE AND WILL GIVE SOME INDICATION ABOUT HOW THE CAPTIVE FINANCIAL RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE COMMERCIAL FUNDS. IN THEIR CAPTIVE CHARITIES ACTUALLY OPERATE THANK YOU THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE WOULD LIKE TO REGISTER SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL COME THE MICROPHONE AND GIVE US YOUR NAME AND YOUR AFFILIATION PLACE. GOOD MORNING MR TURN MEMBERS LEON TROUT AND REPRESENT A NEXT GEN CALIFORNIA WE'RE VERY PLEASED TO SPONSOR THIS LEGISLATION AND SUPPORT FOR ALL OF THE REASONS STATED I'M ALSO REPRESENTING IN THE CALIFORNIA LEAGUE FOR CONCERT. VOTER IN SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS JENNIFER FEARING ON BEHALF OF COUNT ON PROFITS THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF MUSEUMS AND ALSO ON BEHALF OF THE FEARLESS FUND THE DONOR ADVISED FUND THAT MY HUSBAND AND I. HAVE AT THE SACRAMENTO REGIONAL COMMUNITY FOUNDATION WE HAPPILY PROVIDE THE REPORT REQUIRED BY THIS AND IN FACT WE WOULD DO IT DO SO WITHOUT ANONYMITY THANK YOU. THANK YOU I AM JUST LOOKING FOR SUPPORT FOR THIS SAID NOT FOR THEIR TESTIMONY THANK YOU JANUARY TERRACE ON BEHALF OF THE UTILITY REFORM NETWORK TURN IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR ON A MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MANY MYSTERIES MALIBRAN AND I'M HERE ON BEHALF THE OFFICE OF CAT TAYLOR TO SUPPRESS STRONG SUPPORT FOR THE BILL. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. RIGHT SIGNAL THANK YOU SIR OPPOSITION MISTER CHAIR IN COMMITTEE I'M JAMES HEAD I'M OF THE VOICE PRESIDENT OF THE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY FOUNDATIONS OF THE LEAGUE IS AN ASSOCIATION OF THIRTY PLUS COMMITTEE FOUNDATIONS THAT SERVE 95% OF THE STATE'S POPULATION. I'M ALSO THE PRESIDENT AND CEO OF THE EAST BAY COMMUNITY FOUNDATION SEVEN ALAMEDA AND CONTRA COSTA COUNTY IN THE BAY AREA. I FIRST WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE OF GRATITUDE TO ASSEMBLY WEEKS FOR HER WILLINGNESS TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH US ABOUT- AB SEVENTEEN TWELVE AND ABOUT DON'T ADVISE FUNDS. AND OF CHAIRMAN STONE IN THIS COMMITTEE AND THE STAFF- TO ALLOW THAT THAT DISCUSSION AND DIALOGUE TO HAPPEN. HOWEVER THE LEAGUE MEMBERS BOTH LARGE AND SMALL REMAIN CONCERNED AT THAT AS CURRENTLY WRITTEN AB SEVENTEEN TWELVE. RESULT IN SEVERE UNINTENDED. MRS W. FOOD ON ADVICE FUNDS. DON'T ADVISE FUNDS AND THAT'S WHAT WE THINK THAT THIS WILL POTENTIALLY CREATE A CHILLING EFFECT ON THE WILLINGNESS OF CALIFORNIANS TO USED ON ADVICE FUNDS. TO ACCOMPLISH THE JOB OF GIVING. MOST OF THESE DOLLARS WORKS- ASSETS COMMITTEE FOUNDATIONS- BECAUSE OF THEIR DESIRE NOT TO SEEK RECOGNITION- BUT OF THIS IDEA TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE NONPROFIT COMMUNITY AND THE GIVEN OPPORTUNITIES THAT THEY HAVE. OUR MISSION IS A COMMUNITY OPERATIONS IT'S IMPROVE THE WELL BEING OF COMMUNITY MEMBERS ESPECIALLY THOSE MOST IN NEED. THEREFORE WE MAIN ACTS WE MAINTAIN THE HIGHEST DEGREE OF TRANSPARENCY REGARDING DON'T ADVISE FUNDS TO ACCURATE REPORTING. WITH THE SENATE TAKE THE GREATEST LEVEL OF FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR NONPROFITS WHO DON'T ADVISE FUNDS THE WORK THAT WE DO EVERY DAY. AND WE ENSURE THAT THE TAX BENEFITS DON'T ADVISE FUND'S HOLDERS GET RESULTS AND LOCAL COMMUNITY BENEFITS. IN CONCLUSION I THINK THAT WHAT I WOULD SAY IF THAT. WHEN WE TRIED TO ALL OF THE NEED FOR DONNA VICE FUNDS TO BENEFIT COMMUNITIES WE'RE TALKING ACSI NOT SO MUCH ABOUT BILLION AS BUT- SIMPLE CALIFORNIANS WHO SEE THAT THAT THE VEHICLE TO GET BACK TO THE COMMUNITIES- THAT THE SAFE AND WHERE THEY MAKE THEIR THEIR THEIR RESOURCES. THE LEAGUE IS REALLY INTERESTED IN CONTINUE THIS DISCUSSION ABOUT LOCKING WELCOME FOR THE OPPORTUNITIES TO WORK TOGETHER. TO MAKE THAT THE TWO THAT CONTINUES TO BE ONE FOR CALIFORNIANS TO USE- AND THAT CAN BE OFFERED FOR TWO OF A GIVING SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU. EXPRESSED PLEASE. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS NICOLE TAYLOR AND I HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF LEADING THE SILICON VALLEY COMMUNITY FOUNDATION AND I ECHO THE APPRECIATION FOR THE AUTHOR. AND FOR THE COMEDIAN HEARING OUR CONCERNS. WE SHARE WITH YOU AND THE AUTHOR THE GOAL OF ENSURING THE HIGHEST PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS FOR THE PHILANTHROPIC COMMUNITY. HOWEVER REMAIN OPPOSED TO AB SEVENTEEN TWELVE FOR TWO FUNDAMENTAL REASONS. ONE IS A SIGNIFICANT CONCERN RESULTING FROM THE BILL'S FUND BY FUND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. OUR EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE WORKING WITH TENS OF THOUSANDS OF GENEROUS DONORS ACROSS THE STATE. CONVINCE US THAT THESE NEW REQUIREMENTS WOULD DAMAGE THE TRUST THEY PLACED IN US. WELL WE APPRECIATE THAT THE AUTHORS TAKEN THE STEPS TO MITIGATE THE RISK THEY ARE NOT SUFFICIENT TO FULLY PROTECT OUR PRIVACY. THE BILL'S REPORTING REQUIREMENTS CAN EASILY ALLOW SOMEONE IN THE PUBLIC SPHERE TO FIGURE OUT WHO THE DONOR IS AND WHAT ORGANIZATIONS THEY WANT TO GIVE. SO THE QUESTION IS WHY CAN'T ALL CALIFORNIANS HAVE THEIR PRIVACY PROTECTED IN THIS WAY. IN SHORT ORDER WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS GOING TO HAVE A CHILLING EFFECT OF CHARITABLE GIVING THROUGHOUT OUR STATE. THE SECOND CONCERN IS THAT AB SEVENTEEN TWELVE REMAINS DISTURBINGLY VAGUE IN THE PROBLEM IT SEEKS TO ADDRESS IN ITS CURRENT FORM THE BILL PIC CODIFIES IS SUSPICIOUS AN ODDLY DARK VIEW OF THE PERSONAL GENEROSITY. THAT RESULTS IN SEVERAL BILLION DOLLARS OF ANNUAL SUPPORT TO CALIFORNIA FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES IN NEED. IN OUR VIEW THE PROPOSED SWEEPING INCREASING RECORDING REPORTING. AS WELL AS THE UNDEFINED REQUESTS DIRECTED TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL REVEAL THAT A. B. AB SEVENTEEN TWELVE IS NEITHER PRUDENTLY PROPORTIONAL NOT WORTHY OF ITS RISK. MY OLLEAGUES AT THE COMMUNITY FOUNDATIONS AND NATIONAL THAT SPONSORS STAND OPEN AND AVAILABLE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR TO FIND REASONABLE REASONABLE ADAPTATIONS THAT WILL ENHANCE GIVING VEHICLE THAT IS AND HAS BEEN DEMONSTRABLY SUCCESSFUL IN ENCOURAGING AND FACILITATING TERRIBLE GIVING THROUGHOUT OUR GREAT STATE. THANK YOU THAT'S WHAT THIS. MY NAME IS PATRICIA JONES SPEAKING OKAY HERE I AM I'M HERE AS A COUNCIL ON FOUNDATIONS WHICH IS A NATIONAL ORGANIZATION OF FOUNDATIONS NATIONAL STANDARDS REVIEWER I REVIEW NATIONAL CENTERS AND COMMUNITY FOUNDATIONS THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES. ALONE I WANT TO EXPRESS HOW IMPORTANT THAT IS BUT I ALSO WANT EXPRESS THAT WE HAVE THE SAME GOAL BOTH THE PROPONENTS AND OPPONENTS OF THIS BILL WE HAVE THE SAME GOAL WE'RE BOTH LOOKING AT INCREASING CHARITABLE GIVING AND USING THE BEST PRACTICES TO DO THAT. BUT WE WORKED WITH IN THE PAST I'VE WORKED WITH THE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA THREE FOUNDATIONS WE'VE WORKED WITH JANICE OKAY NOT AND CAL ON PROFITS LEGISLATION IN OTHER PROJECTS. AND EXPECT TO DO THAT IN THE FUTURE. BUT WE WANT TO DO WITH THIS BILL IS FIND A PATH. WITH THE AUTHOR AND THE PROPONENTS. TO FIND A PATH TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY HAS A GOOD UNDERSTANDING. OF LOOKING FORWARD TO EXHIBIT WHAT A POWERFUL AND GOOD TOOL DAUGHTER VICE FUNDS ARE INTO INFUSING. A LOT OF MONEY INTO THE NONPROFIT SECTOR- BUT WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT AS- AS UP. ALL ARE VERY RESPECTFUL OF THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY AND THE EXPECTED FEDERAL PER SIDE PRIVACY PROTECTIONS ON DONORS. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU IN THE FUTURE AND WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE WITH US SO FAR THANK YOU. THANK YOU. WHAT ELSE IN OPPOSITION IF YOU COULD GIVE US YOUR NAME AND YOUR AFFILIATION PLEASE. GOOD MORNING MR NUMBERS TO SAY AROUND THROUGH ON BEHALF OF PHILANTHROPY CALIFORNIA A NETWORK OF SAN DIEGO GRANT MAKERS NORTHERN CALIFORNIA GRANT MAKERS AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA GRANT MAKERS. ON MY COLLEAGUES AT THE PLANT THE ROUND TABLE IN THE LINES OF TERRIBLE REFORM WOULD ALSO LIKE TO SHOW THE CONCERNS ABOUT WHAT THE BILL. THANK YOU. JIM LIGHTS UP HAVE A VANGUARD CHARITABLE WE ARE OPPOSED IN LESS AMENDED THANK YOU. FRED MADE ON BEHALF OF FIDELITY CHARITABLE OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED. MAP BACK ON BEHALF OF SWAP CHARITABLE OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED THANK YOU. CRISP FALL UNDER A BEHALF OF THE NATIONAL PHILANTHROPIC TRUST OPPOSE A LAST MINUTE. THANK YOU. RIGHT OF BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS. MR BIRTHDAY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR UP TO SOMEONE WOMAN I THINK YOU'VE IDENTIFIED SOME REALLY. THE SYSTEM REALLY IMPORTANT CONCERNS WITH WHAT'S GOING ON IN THIS INDUSTRY- IT THE BILL ALLOWS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO ASK A SERIES OF QUESTIONS WHICH I THINK ARE ARE MOSTLY VERY APPROPRIATE. BUT I'LL TELL YOU MY CONCERN WITH THE BILL IS THAT IN ADDITION TO ASKING THOSE QUESTIONS THAT HAVE DIRECT RELEVANCE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL CAN DEMAND ANY INFORMATION THAT IT DEEMS NECESSARY TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THE FUNDS ARE BEING PROPERLY ADMINISTERED. AND THAT IS NOT A- INFORMATION THAT WE ARE FORCE ANY OTHER KIND OF INVESTMENT TO DISCLOSE OUR MOMENT OR IF YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE THINKING WAS BECAUSE I'M REALLY STRUGGLING WITH THAT. BECAUSE IF THAT WERE NOT IN THE BILL I GOT SOME CONCERNS ABOUT ABOUT DINNER PRIVACY AS WELL BUT A BIT OF AN ASIDE FROM THOSE OF I'M SUPPORTIVEOF WHAT YOU'RE DOING BUT I MEAN IT IT REALLY SEEMS LIKE AN OVER REACH THE WAY THE BILL AS WRITTEN. ACTUALLY BUT CHEN TAKE. ASSEMBLYMEMBER OUT WE'VE ACTUALLY WORKED VERY CLOSELY WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE ON THIS BILL. IT'S CLEAR THAT- WE CAN'T SPECIFY IN THE BILL EXACTLY ALL THE DETAILS LIKE SHOULD INCLUDE THE ZIP CODE OR NOT. AND SO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE. THIS IS TYPICAL LANGUAGE WHERE THEY WILL KEEP TO THE IDEAS THAT ARE PRESENTED HERE. BUT IT GIVES SOME THE LET THE LEVERAGE TO BE ABLE TO ASK THAT KIND JUST TO FLESH IT OUT. TO A LARGE DEGREE. OKAY I UNDERSTAND BUT I MEAN IT'S OUR JOB AND LEGISLATURE ARE YOU TO VIEW FULL CHROMIA BALANCING THE NEEDS OF. OF PRIVACY IN INDUSTRY ON ONE SIDE AND THE NEEDS OF PUBLIC INTEREST ON THE OTHER AND I'M AFRAID IF WE JUST GOING TO. GIVE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL FREE RANGE THE MAN WHATEVER INFORMATION THAT THEY WANT FROM THIS AND THREE. THAT THAT'S AN OVER REACH AND THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO PREVENT ME FROM SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY. I UNDERSTAND THAT I THINK I HAVE A LOT OF CONFIDENCE IN THE TOURNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE IN GENERAL NOT JUST THIS PARTICULAR ADMINISTRATION TO BE FAIR- AND REALISTIC ABOUT HOW THEY'VE CRAFT LEGISLATION. HELLO GOOD AND JUST TO ADD ON THE PRIVACY FRONT I MEAN WE-HEARD HEARD LOUD AND CLEAR ON JEOPARDIZE ANYONE'S- PRIVACY ON THIS AND SO I THINK. WHAT WE PUT FORTH IT'S A GOOD COMPROMISE IT'S I THINK FOR SERVE STANDARD PROTOCOL. TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE PROTECTING OUR PRIVACY NO NAME SUBMITTED NO ADDRESS NO CONTACT INFORMATION OF PHONE NUMBERS AND EMAIL ADDRESSES- REALLY JUST SORT OF AN ACCOUNT NUMBER. SO WE CAN SEE WHAT WE WANT TO KNOW IS. YOU KNOW. THE MONEY WENT INTO DEATH DID IT GO OUT RIGHT- AND I THINK. I THINK AS AS YOU THE OPPOSITION SAID TO I THINK THEY ALSO WANT TO ENSURE THAT. THEIR MONEY IS MAKING IT OUT TO THE COMMUNITY WE JUST DON'T HAVE THE INSIDE RIGHT NOW. OR THE SUNLIGHT ON IF THAT IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING WHEN THERE'S AGGREGATED DATA THAT'S WHY THE INDIVIDUAL. INFORMATION IS CRITICAL SURE BUT- I THINK WE'RE ON THE SAME PAGE ABOUT. I HAVE SOME CONCERNS OF PRIVACY AS WELL. HAPPY THAT YOU'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON IT. I THINK THAT THE ARGUMENT IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS WAS REALLY FASCINATING ABOUT. THE WAYS IN WHICH JUST DISCLOSURE OF WHAT THE ASSETS WERE. COULD REVEAL THE IDENTITY OF SOME OF THE DONORS JUST BECAUSE OF YOU KNOW THE UNIQUE NATURE OF THE ASSETS THAT ARE IN THE DEATH. SO I'M HOPEFUL THAT YOU CAN CONTINUE TO WORK ON THAT BUT I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU. A I'LL BE IN RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION TODAY BECAUSE OF THOSE CONCERNS. I IF YOU COULD AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD I MEAN I TINK. I THINK IT WOULDN'T TAKE A LOT TO GET THIS BILL INTO A- FORM OF. SOMETHING THAT THAT I AND OTHER PEOPLE COULD SUPPORT- BUT BUT IF YOU WOULD LOOK AT MAYBE LIMITING THE INFORMATION THAT THE AG KIND. OF BECOME COULD ASK FOR BECAUSE I DON'T THINK IT'S A HEALTHY THING TO GET THEM. WATCH SURE I WILL LOOK. TO IT AND I'LL CONTINUE TO WORK ON THE PRIVACY PIECES WALDRON. THIS IS A- I AS GONNA SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY I AM I AM THANK YOU TO THINK THAT IS THE MOST OF THEIR CS THANK YOU I AM CONCERNED I'M AND I THINK I SPOKE WITH ADVOCATES- I PROBABLY I IT I SHARE THE CONCERNS AND WOULD SUPPORT SOMETHING THAT DELAYED A TAX BENEFIT UNTIL THE MONEY WAS ACTUALLY SENT I WOULD SUPPORT SOMETHING- THAT PUT A NUMBER ON WHEN AN APPROPRIATE AMOUNT I'M GOING OUT IS. I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED- I THINK MR OBERNOLTE SAID IT BETTER THAT WERE WERE ENGAGE IN SOME KIND FISHING EXPEDITION- I LIKE IT'S I'D LIKE TO HAVE A BILL WHERE THE PROBLEM IS CLEAR AND THE SOLUTION FOR THE PROBLEM- THE PROBLEM IS HERE I THINK WE CAN AGREE THAT THERE'S A PROBLEM- I'M NOT SURE IF THE SOLUTION FITS THIS PART. AND SO THAT'S WHERE WE HAD A GOOD DISCUSSION AND OFFICE AND PERHAPS I MOVING TO STEPS TO QUICK BECAUSE YOU KNOW I UNDERSTAND THERE IS A NEED ARE FIRED BEGET. I'D BEEN ON I DON'T SUGGEST I KNOW A BETTER WAY. BUT IT DOES COME TO. SELL IT WOULD FEEL BETTER IF. ANY FOUNDATION OF WAS AT LEAST NEUTRAL ON THIS THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE THEY'RE VERY MUCH OPPOSED AND- WORKING CLOSELY WITH THEM OVER THE YEARS ON ON FUNDING NONPROFITS IN MY DISTRICT- REALLY THE PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE OF MY DISTRICT NONPROFITS I DON'T WANT TO BE IN A POSITION WHERE- WERE WERE SOMEOW LIMITING NOT HELP- I JUST WANT TO KEEP TALKING I WANT TO SEE WHAT WE CAN DO TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION. THERE WERE- AT WHAT I THINK YOU'VE IDENTIFIED IS REALLY. BUT YEAH SO HOPEFULLY WE CAN LIKE IN THE NEXT WEEK YEAH. WITH PLENTY OF TIME. NO I'M COMMITTED TO AND HAVE HAD ONGOING CONVERSATIONS WITH OPPOSITIONWILL CONTINUE TO DO SO AS WELL I MEAN IT IS DEFINITELY NOT MYINTENT TO HAVE UNDER THESE AND IT HAD A CONSEQUENCES OF YOU KNOW- ABATING GIVING AND ALL THOSE TYPES OF THINGS I WORK CLOSELY WITH MY COMMUNITY FOUNDATIONS AS WELL THEY'RE SPLIT ON IT- BUT I HEAR YOU LOUD AND CLEAR WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE EIGHT. THE GREAT WORK THAT THEY DO. YOU KNOW AND IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU ARE TWO STEPS AHEAD OF. THE BABY YOUR IN THE BILL'S NEXT YEAR ON THE- JOB. BUT I DO THINK THAT THE IDEA ON THIS IS THE TRANSPARENCY PEACE BUT I WILL WORK WITH YOUR OFFICE AND WITH THE OPPOSITION AS WELL. THANK YOU MISTER KILEY KALRA. COULD YOU JUST TO HELP ME UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BETTER WHAT EXACTLY YOU THINGS GOING ON HERE AND HOW IT IS THAT THESE ARE OR WHAT FOR WHAT PURPOSE ARE IN WHAT IMPROPER PURPOSE THESE- ARE BEING USED I HEARD SOME MENTION OF- POSSIBLE A RELATIONSHIP WITH THE FOR PROFIT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS- SO WHAT EXACTLY YOU THINK IT IS THAT WE BE TRYING TO UNCOVER SURE SO I THINK AND I L. MY WITNESSES CAN. TALK AS WELL BUT THERE BEEN NUMEROUS MEDIA ACCOUNTS- OVER THE LAST YEAR PLUS- AROUND MONEY GOING INTO DAFT'S BUT THEN POTENTIALLY NOT MAKE IT OUT TO THE COMMUNITY AND SO IS SOMEONE AS WE ALL OUR STUDENTS OF PUBLIC DOLLARS RIGHT WE MADE THE TO THOSE FOLKS READING AT A TAX WRITE OFF SO THAT MONEY CAN GET INTO THE COMMUNITY. AT ITS SOBRE. COMING OUR PUBLIC FUNDS. BUT IT. YEAH JUST ANSWER THE QUESTION- THERE'S SERVE ANECDOTAL INFORMATION THAT WE READ ABOUT AND I'M BUT YOU GUYS CAN SHARE SOME OF THAT IF YOU WANT- SO IT'S WE'RE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND. THIS IS A VERY UNREGULATED STAFFS ARE ARE BASICALLY UNREGULATED. FOUNDATION BOTTOM RIGHT THEY HAVE A PAY OUT THAT THEY HAVE TO- PUSH OUT. OF DEATH DON'T HAVE THOSE OF SAME EXPECTATIONS AND SO. AS THIS IS A GROWING PART OF THE PHILANTHROPIC MONIES THAT IS IT'S MONEY THAT'S COMING OUT OF OUR TAX BASE. MORE INSIGHT AND TRANSPARENCY TO IF THAT MONEY IS REALLY GETTING AND THE COMMUNITY IS THE POINT OF THE BILL. BUT WHAT'S THE REASON WHY THEY MAY NOT BE GOOD PUTTING THE MONEY. THE DORMANT ACCOUNTS I MEAN I DON'T KNOW IF. WELL WHAT WE CAN TELL YOU IS WHAT THE PRESS IS TOSSING ABOUT FOR EXAMPLE THE NEW YORK TIMES THE LA TIMES FORBES OF BLOOMBERG AND MANY OTHER PRESS HAVE REPORTED ON A NUMBER OF THINGS ONE IS. THE USE OF DONOR ADVISED FUNDS WERE FOUND DAIS PRIVATE FOUNDATIONS MOVING THEIR MONEY INTO A DONOR ADVISED FUNDS THAT THEY CONTROL- SO TO MEET THE PAYOUT REQUIREMENT WITHOUT ACTUALLY GIVING ANY MONEY OUT. ANOTHER ONE THE NEW YORK TIMES AS TECH BILLIONAIRES HACKED OF TAXES WITH THE PHILANTHROPIC LOOPHOLE IS THE USE OF LARA BECAUSE LARGE DONORS LARGE DONOR ADVISED FUNDS VERY OFTEN. THE DONORS NOT ONLY CONTROL WHAT THAT THE MONEY GOES OUT OR NOT BUT THEY ALSO CONTROL ALL THE MONEY IS INVESTED. AND SO THEIR USE THE MOVING THOSE INVESTMENTS AROUND. I AND IS THAT. THAT THE PRESS HAS REPORTED ARE FOR PERSONAL GAIN TO SUPPORT COMPANIES IN WHICH THEY ARE OTHERWISE INVESTED WERE TO MANIPULATE STOCK PRICES. SO AGAIN WE THINK THAT THESE ARE ANECDOTAL AND EVIDENCE IT'S BEEN. BROUGHT UP BY MANY MANY PEOPLE IN THE PRESS AND THAT'S IS WHAT ONE OF THE REASONS I THINK WHY WE'RE STARTING WITH TRANSPARENCY. RATHER THAN BRING IN SOMETHING ELSE. REMEMBER ACT LIKE THE AUTHOR OF TWO REASONS IN MY EXPERIENCE OF. OF ALMOST EIGHTEEN YEARS NOW AT THE- IN THE COMMUNICATION FEEL- WE HAVE A DOLLARS WHO COME TO US- WHO WERE SORT OF MODERATE- CALIFORNIANS INTENSIVE THEIR FINANCIAL. STATUS WHO WANT TO ESTABLISH A DONOR ADVISED FUND BECAUSE THEY WANT TO GET BACK TO THE COMMUNITY- BUT THEY DON'T YET KNOW WHAT ISSUES THEY WANT TO ACTUALLY FOCUS ON. AND SO THEY WANT TIME- IN TERMS OF A STEP IN THE FIGHT AND THEN HAVING TIME ACSI TO EXPLORE THE ISSUES THAT ARE MOST IMPORTANT TO THEM THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT TO THE COMMUNITY- SO IT SOMETIMES DOES TAKE THEM TIME TO DECIDE- THE KINDS OF ORGANIZATIONS AND THE KINDS OF. IT IS AN EFFORT THEY WANT TO THEY WANT TO CONTRIBUTE TO IT SO THAT'S ONE THE SECOND IS THAT BECAUSE WE HAVE A SMALL VESSEL FOR DON INVITE FUNDS BUT YOU CAN PUT IT ON THE VICE FUND AT THE SECOND FOUNDATION. FOR TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A MANY I'M THEY WANT TO BUILD. SO THAT THEY CAN HAVE THE MAXIMUM IMPACT IN THE KEY THEY WANT TO HAVE SO THAT MADE ME WANT TO TAKE SOME TIME AT THE TO ADD TO THAT AND OVER. TIME IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO MAXIMIZE IN THE END. AND TRYING TO TRANSIT. HOUSE WHEN I SAY THAT WE ARE ACTUALLY HIGHLY RATHER REGULATED WE REPORT QUITE A BIT OF INFORMATION ON OUR NINE NINETIES WE HAVE TO REPOT ON IRAQ'S ATTORNEY GENERAL THAN THE CALIFORNIA NONPROFIT INTEGRITY ACT ACTUALLY PREVENTS ANY SELF DEALING WE HAVE- QUITE A BIT OF REGULATIONS THAT WE HAVE TO FOLLOW SO EVEN AT THAT IN TERMS OF INVESTMENTS THAT. IT'S ILLEGAL TO DO WHAT AT WHAT THE ACT OUT HIS SAD SO- THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE TAKE VERY SERIOUSLY BECAUSE WE ARE PUBLIC CHARITY AND REGISTERED- HURTS TO A CUT LET'S INSIST. I KNOW WE'RE TRYING TO ASK A THE FIRST NAME IS KILEY AFTER A VERY BROAD QUESTION YEAH SO MY DILEMMA HERE IS GETTING ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS YES AND THIS IS ALL VERY INTERESTING AND IT'S APPROPRIATE AND AVOIDING WHICH IS. A MEN'S AND CAN YOU TEST THEM UP SO. I CAN DO FIFTY THANK YOU OKAY. WHEN A DONOR. ANY TO ANY FEDERATION IT IS NOW PART OF COMMITTEE FOUNDATION SO THAT THE COMMITTEE FOUNDATION OWNS THAT MONEY THE DONOR DOES NO LONGER NO LONGER OWNS THAT THEY GET THE TAX BENEFIT. AND SO THEY ARE HIGHLY REGULATED JUST LIKE COMMUNITY FOUNDATIONS ARE. THEY DON'T HAVE CONTROL THEY THEY CAN RECOMMEND AND OFTEN MOST OFTEN IF THE RECOMMENDATIONS MADE THE DUE DILIGENCE COMMUNITY FOUNDATION. IS A STRONGER DILIGENCE. THEN THE MONEY WILL GO OUT IF THEY IF THEY WANT TO GIVE MONEY TO SAY- SUPPORT FOR. POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS WHICH I'M SURE WOULD BE VERY NOT WORTH IT AND. BUT I CAN'T DO THAT YEAH THEY CAN'T DO THAT I CAN'T ELECTION- SO THERE'S CERTAIN RULES REGULATIONS AROUND THAT AS WELL AND- SPORTS ACTIVE FUNDS ONE REAL. OF THIRTY SECULAR LIKE WHEN YOU KNOW YOUR FIFTH. TIME WE WOULD LOVE TO WORK ON ACTIVE FUNDS POLICY RIGHT OKAY THANK YOU A THAT WAS HELPFUL FROM FROM BOTH SIDES I GUESS THAT. THE WAY I SEE IT I MEAN HAT I HEAR THE EXAMPLES OF ABUSE THAT YOU. BRING UP OF COURSE THAT'S A POTENTIAL THAT EXISTS ANY FORM OF CHARITABLE GIVING AND SO. WHAT I'M KIND OF LOOKING FOR IS- HOW THIS PARTICULAR VEHICLE CREATES UNIQUE OPPORTUNITIES FOR ABUSE THAT JUSTICE. IS THIS UNIQUE REMEDY THAT HAS ALL THESE POTENTIALLY NEGATIVE ON AND HER. ONCE I'M JUST NOT SURE OF HER THAT. SO SORRY GO AHEAD. HELLO GIVE A QUICK TRY. THE INCENTIVES FOR- LOCAL COMMUNITY FOUNDATIONS AND THEN THE NATIONAL COMMERCIAL FUNDS ARE VERY DIFFERENT RIGHT LOCAL COMMUNITIES YOU LIVE IN A COMMUNITY RESPONSIVE TO COMMUNITY NEEDS DOORS ARE USUALLY FOCUS ON A PARTICULAR PLACE- WE DON'T KNOW THIS TO BE THE CASE WITH THE COMMERCIAL FUNDS BUT THEY MANAGE. BILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR. THEY SEE SOME OPPORTUNITIES TO- SAY FOR TAX REASONS RIGHT BENEFITS REASONS LET'S MOVE SOME INTO A DONOR ADVISED FUND WE CAN CONTINUE TO MANAGE IT FOR YOU RIGHT AND WHEN YOU'RE READY. YOU CAN GIVE IT TO CHARITABLE CAUSES THAT YOU CARE ABOUT BUT THE INCENTIVES WITHIN THOSE ORGANIZATIONS WE'RE NOT SURE. ARE THE SAME AS COMMUNITY FOUNDATION TO SAY I STE I'M DRIVING BY MY COMMUNITIES EVERY DAY AND I'M REALLY FEEL A NEED TO IMPROVE MY LOCAL COMMUNITY I MANAGING FUNDS. THE DONORS NOT BOTHERING ME. RIGHT MAYBE I'M NOT IN A HURRY TO GET THE MONEY OUT OR TO HELP OF VICE THE DONOR ON CHOOSING- FILL UP A GOAL IN FACT. THAT THE FUNDS PRIDE THEMSELVES IN BEING AGNOSTIC NEUTRAL. THEY DON'T VIEW IT AS WHAT WE HEARD OF YOU AS THEIR TAPPED OWNERS YOU'RE OUT WHAT THEY'RE FOR TOPICAL STAR. SO THAT'S A CONCERT. MISTER KALRA. THANK YOU AND WE HAVE A LOT OF REALLY GOOD PEOPLE AROUND THIS TABLE THEY'RE ALL TRYING TO DO THE RIGHT THING AND CLEAN THE AUTHOR- AND SO I APPRECIATE- BOTH THE COMPONENTS IN OPPOSITION- I DO THINK THAT THE THAT THAT IS AN ISSUE AND- I THINK THE BILL. UP ARE NOT A- CATCH ALL SOLUTION BUT I ALSO THINK IT DOES AS INDICATED BY OPPOSITION CREATE SOME MISSION THEIR PERSPECTIVE I REALLY APPRECIATE THE DIALOGUE THAT'S ALREADY OCCURRED HAS BEEN AMENDMENTS ALREADY BECAUSE OF THAT DIALOGUE THIS IS THE FIRST COMMITTEE AND SO AS AS AS- ARE OPPOSITION IS INDICATED THERE ARE STILL ALL YEARS AND WILLING TO SIT DOWN AND HAVE THE DIALOGUE WHICH I THINK IS A REALLY IMPORTANT ESPECIALLY AT THIS STAGE OF A WITH THE BILL IS. AND YOU KNOW OF COURSE IS. SELECT COMMITTEE FOUNDATION THOUGH. THAT THEY DO EVERY DAY. THIRTEEN APPRECIATED I DO THINK ONE OF THE ISSUES AS A SUMMER KILEY WAS INDICATING KIND OF WHAT THE BUT WHAT IS THE PROBLEM TRYING TO. WE'RE TRYING TO SOLVE YOUR THE FACT. OF AS MENTIONED THAT. FOLKS GET THE MONEY AND THEY GET THE TAX. BENEFIT IMMEDIATELY AND YET THE MONEY DOESN'T ACTUALLY GO OUT IMMEDIATELY. AND SO. THAT'S AN ISSUE THAT MAYBE THE TRASH I MEAN IF YOU GO OUT FOR THE TAX. ISSUE THAT'S ACTUALLY A MUCH PROBABLY BIGGER BILL IN TERMS OF THE OPPOSITION BUT YOU MAY BASED ON THAT. I THINK THE TRANSPARENCY AND GETTING MORE KNOWLEDGE AS TO WHAT'S HAPPENING. IS PROBABLY A MUCH MILDER FIRST APPROACH AS TO HOW YOU DEAL WITH THE ISSUE OF MONEY SITTING IDLE. AND DOGS I GET THE TAX BENEFIT GET IT. WHEN THEY GET A MILLION DOLLARS STOCKS THEY GET THAT TAX BREAK. THEY MAKE ABOUT THE MONEY. HAVE YEARS LATER ON THAT STOCKS WITH HALF A MILLION. AS THE COMMUNITIES CITY SAME MAKE THE SAME BENEFITS AS THE TIME TO BREAK THAT WAS. GIVEN AT THE TIME THAT WAS PUT INTO THE FUND SO THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT ANGLES. OF AND THAT THAT- THAT WE CAN APPROACH THIS ISSUE AT. BUT I THINK WE HAVE THE RIGHT THE TABLE TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO. AND SO I APPRECIATE THE CHAIR'S RECOMMENDATION THE WORK OF THE OF THE COMMITTEE STAFF. AS WELL AS THE AUTHOR AND REALLY TRYING TO FIGURE OUT A PATH FORWARD AND I'M CONFIDENT- WITH THE PEOPLE. THAT WE HAVE HERE IN THIS ROOM AND OTHERS THAT HAVE EXPRESSED. CONCERN AND SUPPORT- DOUBLE BILL TO GET THAT DONE SO AS ONE EXPRESS MY THOUGHTS ON. THANK YOU OTHER QUESTIONS SUCH. I'M NOT GONNA GO IT MISTER KALRA JUST SAID BUT THE SENTIMENT IS ONE THAT I WANT TO REITERATE WHICH IS- I THINK EVERYONE INVOLVED IN THIS CONVERSATION ON BOTH SIDES OF THE SUPPORT OPPOSITION- REALLY DO MEAN WELL AND WE'RE TRYING TO. ACCOMPLISH THE SAME GOALS. AND I'M VERY SYMPATHETIC TO THE PICTURE THAT I THINK OF THE PRESENT LEAGUE HAD LAID OUT ON- SOME REASONS WHY. IN THESE FUNDS THEY MAY NOT BE SOME IMMEDIATE INVESTMENTS. THAT BEING SAID YOU KNOW WE ALL KNOW WHAT THE STORIES HAVE BEEN OF OPPOSITE AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO. TO GRAPPLE WITH AND SO A FEW THINGS I WANT TO SAY YOU KNOW THIS IS NOT ABOUT DEMONIZING THE LEADERSHIP OF THE FOUNDATION WORLD I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO STATE THAT. BUT WE HAVE A STRUCTURE THAT SET UP THAT. HE'D TO ABUSE ARE WE THINK THERE HAVE BEEN DOCUMENTED- OCCASIONS OF THAT ABUSE AND FOR ME THE- THAT HAVE HUNDREDS OF NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS. THAT WE LINE MAKING FOR THAT. DOES NOT. THAT ARE IN THEIR NEEDS THANK. WE DEALT WITH HERE IS WHAT YOU NEED TO THINK WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING I'M VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT THE AUTHOR HAS BEEN WILLING TO TAKE A MOMENT AND ENGAGE IN CONVERSATIONS AROUND AMENDMENTS THAT SOMEONE IS CLOSE TO BOTH THE NONPROFITS ON THE ONE SIDE BUT ALSO THE PHILANTHROPIC COMMUNITY OTHER I'VE OFFERED TO THE AUTHOR MORE THAN HAPPY TO WORK WITH HER AND OTHERS I THINK WE ALL ARE TO FIGURE OUT THE RIGHT ANSWER HERE BECAUSE- LONGEST PLOWED REMAINS. IF THIS BILL DOES NOT FORD DOESN'T TAKE AWAY THE FACT THAT WE HAVE BILLIONAIRES WHO ARE TELLING US THIS IS A TAX LOOPHOLE AND WE HAVE FOLKS WHO STARTED THIS VEHICLE METHOD WHO HAVE SAID THERE'S A REAL PROBLEM HERE SO- SO MY HOPE IS WE CAN GET TO ANSWER WE STILL HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF TIME- AND THE REST OF THE YEAR SO- WITH THAT TO. LOOK FORWARD TO SUPPORTING THE TODAY CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION. THANK YOU. SO MUCH THANK YOU FOR WE SLOW THIS DOWN FROM LAST YEAR BECAUSE OF SOME OF THESE CONCERNS AND THE AMENDMENTS OR SOMETHING THAT WERE. VERY IMPORTANT TO ME. BECAUSE I THINK THERE IS A DIFFERENCE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE SCALE AND THIS IS REALLY WHAT WE TRIED TO DO. I WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH MY LOCAL COMMUNITY FOUNDATIONS AND ANOTHER MANY AROUND THE STATE AND I TRUST THEM. BECAUSE THEY ARE GOVERNED BY LOCAL MEMBRANE. AND BECAUSE OF THAT I THINK A LOT OF THE CONCERNS ABOUT MONEY NOT MOVE IT ABOUT. NOT MAKING THE RIGHT INVESTMENTS IN THE COMMUNITY ARE SOMEWHAT OUT OF IT. I THINK THE MEMBERS OF THE GOVERNANCE OF LOCAL COMMUNITY FOUNDATIONS. AND SPECIALLY THOSE THAT THAT I'M FAMILIAR WITH. WOULD NOT STAND FOR THAT RIGHT AND HAVE TO ANSWER ULTIMATELY TO THE COMMUNITY. SO TO ME THAT'S NOT WHAT THE PROBLEM IS. AND IT SILICON VALLEY WE WILL BE SET A STANDARD TO TRY AND- AN EXAM THESE LOCAL ESPECIALLY SMALLER. THAT IT IS BECAUSE OF THAT LEVEL OF GOVERNANCE SO I DON'T THINK WITH WILL SEE THAT THE CHALLENGES THAT. THAT THIS BILL BRINGS UP IN. AND I THINK THOSE ARE SIGNIFICANT IF THE TAX LAW HAS CREATED THIS LOOPHOLE FOR. FOR WEALTHY PEOPLE TO PARK MONEY. IN THE NAME OF BENEFITS COMMUNITY AND NOT PROVIDING THAT BENEFITS THE COMMUNITY THAT IS SOMETHING WE SHOULD ALL BE CONCERNED ABOUT. SO THE LEVEL OF TRYING TO FIND. THE RIGHT MECHANISM HERE TO BUILD IN TRANSPARENCY TO WHAT IS HAPPENING. AND THEN SEE WHAT OTHER STEPS MIGHT BE TAKEN I THINK IS ABSOLUTELY LAUDABLE AND THAT'S THE GOAL HERE. THERE ARE SOME LARGER FOUNDATIONS AND SILICON VALLEY IT AND OTHERS THAT ARE. THAT ARE BIG ENOUGH AND SO WE SET THAT NUMBER TO TRY ANY CAPSULE EIGHT. THE LION'S SHARE OF THE COMMUNITY FOUNDATIONS BECAUSE I GET THOSE ARGUMENTS IT'S I DON'T KNOW THAT THEY THEY NEED TO BE SWEPT UP IN THIS. THE LARGER THE COMMERCIAL FUNDS YEAH I THINK THAT'S VERY MUCH A LEGITIMATE QUESTION. QUESTIONS OF PRIVACY. ABSOLUTELY REMAIN IN THIS LEGISLATURE IS VERY SENSITIVE TO. PRIVACY WE OF LONG FOUGHT THOSE. PRIVACY CONCERNS TRYING TO CREATE. GIVE CALIFORNIANS CONFIDENCE IN THE DECISIONS THAT THEY MAY BUT THERE ARE SOME UNIQUE ATTRIBUTES OF THE WAY. CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS AND THAT WEALTH AND- OR- COULD BE IDENTIFIED. THAT VERSUS THE- THE GOALS WERE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH HERE AT THE MISERABLE IS RIGHT TO THE THOSE ARE THINGS WE HAVE TO BALANCE. AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO IN THIS OR OTHERS GET EVERYTHING ABSOLUTELY PERFECT. BUT I THINK THIS UNDERLYING NEED TO FIND THE INFORMATION. FIGURE OUT WHAT IS GOING ON. AND IT ARE THERE THEN FURTHER STEPS WE NEED TO TAKE MAYBE MAYBE NOT I DON'T THINK THAT'S BEEN SETTLED YET AT THIS POINT. BUT WE NEED THAT INFORMATION AND GIVING. THAT WHAT WE DO KNOW ABOUT AT LEAST AT THE LARGEST LEVEL AND WHAT'S AT STAKE THERE ARE SOME CONCERNS TO BE ABLE TO RAISE THAT THAT'S KIND OF WHAT. THE GIVE AND TAKE WAS THROUGH THE FALL AND- THE NUMBER OF MEETINGS THAT STAFF YOUR STAFF PEOPLE AROUND THE TABLE HAVE. HAVE BEEN TO TRY AND SORT THIS OUT THAT THAT'LL TIMIDLY. GOALS SO I DO UNDERSTAND WHY THE COMMUNITY FOUNDATION LEAGUE IS OPPOSED TO IT AT THAT THIS SETS AND A LITTLE BIT CONCERNED. BY WE TRY TO DEAL WITH SOME OF THAT. NOT ALL OF IT BUT MOST OF IT. BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF WHAT COMMUNITY FOUNDATIONS DO WHEN AND WHAT THEY REPRESENT. SO FROM THIS COMMITTEE STANDPOINT I THINK WE'VE COME TO A POINT WHERE I THINK IT'S WORTHY OF PASSING THIS THROUGH AND I HOPE WE DO PASSES THROUGH AT THIS POINT. THE JOB APPROPRIATIONS MS WAKES YOU UP THE FLOOR SWEPT THE SENATE WHERE A LOT OF THESE QUESTIONS ARE GOING TO STILL COME UP AND HAVE WE CREATED THE RIGHT BALANCE HERE. I THINK FOR THIS COMMITTEE YES BUT IN THE LONG RUN I THINK WE HAVE A LOT TO LEARN ABOUT BUT I DO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE. TEXTING THE LOCAL SMALLER ONES WHO ARE MAKING THOSE INVESTMENTS AND ARE MAKING THOSE INVESTMENTS. LOCALLY AND NOT NECESSARILY CARRYING MONEY FOR. OUT OF STATE OUT OF COUNTRY KINDS OF INVESTMENTS BECAUSE- THOSE THEN. I THINK RAISE THE QUESTION YET AGAIN. ABOUT THE PROPRIETY OF HOW THESE INVESTMENTS ARE OR ARE NOT BEING MADE YEAH SO YOU'VE RAISED. A DIFFICULT ISSUE AN INTERESTING ISSUE YES. AND UNFORTUNATELY ONE THAT. I THINK THE PROBLEM IS WELL ARTICULATED. BUT THE FAX AROUND IT ARE NOT NECESSARILY RIGHT AND THAT'S WHAT. THE DEAL THE WERE CRAFTING SOMETHING THAT CAN GO TO DISCOVER THOSE FACTS AND FIGURE OUT WHAT WE NEED TO DO. APPRECIATE THE WORK AND WITHOUT YOU MAY CALL. AT THANK YOU FOR.
