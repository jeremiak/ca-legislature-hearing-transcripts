OR PERHAPS NEVER COMPLETED

00:35:43.074 --> 00:35:46.577
BECAUSE THE MONEY IS GOING TO BE

00:35:46.644 --> 00:35:48.012
DIVERTED TO ANOTHER PURPOSE.

00:35:48.079 --> 00:35:49.380
SO IRRESPECTIVE OF WHAT YOU

00:36:34.225 --> 00:36:35.526
COMPLETE.

00:36:35.593 --> 00:36:37.962
WASTE OF MONEY.

00:36:38.029 --> 00:36:39.764
MAKING AN ARGUMENT THAT YOU ARE

I DON'T KNOW TO WHO.

00:36:51.075 --> 00:36:52.977
THAT MAKES SENSE.

00:36:53.044 --> 00:36:54.812
BUT THAT IF YOU DO THE MATH THAT

00:36:54.879 --> 00:36:57.315
LEAVES A THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED

00:36:57.381 --> 00:36:58.115
MILES [inaudible]

00:36:58.182 --> 00:37:02.053

FALLEN.

00:37:25.876 --> 00:37:27.645
AND EVERY WALL THAT THAT HAS

00:37:27.712 --> 00:37:29.680
FALLEN IN HISTORY.

00:37:29.747 --> 00:37:31.949
WAS NOT ONLY PENETRATED BUT IT

00:37:32.016 --> 00:37:34.051
WAS PENETRATED THROUGH.

00:37:34.118 --> 00:37:35.820
RIGOROUS DEFENSES OF PEOPLE THAT

00:37:35.886 --> 00:37:37.755
WERE DEFENDING THOSE WALLS WITH

00:37:37.822 --> 00:37:40.124
WITH CANNONS AND WEAPONS AND AN

00:37:40.191 --> 00:37:42.259

00:37:42.326 --> 00:37:44.328
THIS WALL WILL NOT HAVE THAT IT

00:37:44.395 --> 00:37:45.830
WILL BE JUST A BLANK.

00:37:45.896 --> 00:37:47.698
WALL IT WOULD BE A WALL THAT

00:37:47.765 --> 00:37:49.333
ANYBODY COULD SCALAR DIG UNDER

00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:51.569
CUT THROUGH.

00:37:51.636 --> 00:37:53.404
AND AND THIS IS JUST A UP.

00:37:53.471 --> 00:37:56.474
THE RESULT OF AN OF ABSURD PROP.

00:37:56.540 --> 00:37:58.009
UP PROMISE.

00:37:58.075 --> 00:37:59.343
THE PRESIDENT MADE THAT THE

00:37:59.410 --> 00:38:01.612
CONGRESS DID NOT HAVE THE

00:38:01.679 --> 00:38:03.347
COURAGE TO BLOCK.

00:38:03.414 --> 00:38:05.383
EVERYONE AGREES THIS IS A ABUSE

00:38:05.449 --> 00:38:08.352
OF POWER BUT THE CONGRESS JUST

00:38:08.419 --> 00:38:10.655
DID NOT HAVE THE BACKBONE. TO

00:38:10.721 --> 00:38:12.590
STAND UP AND DO THEIR JOB AND BE

00:38:12.657 --> 00:38:14.592
THE CONGRESS WHICH IS PROBABLY

00:38:14.659 --> 00:38:16.360
WHY THEY'RE APPROVAL APPROVAL

AMONG AMERICANS.

00:38:21.899 --> 00:38:24.869
CALIFORNIA WOULD BE DEEPLY HURT

00:38:24.935 --> 00:38:26.704

STRATEGIC.

00:38:30.074 --> 00:38:32.810
OF PROJECTS THAT WE WE NEED FOR

00:38:32.877 --> 00:38:34.111
OUR NATIONAL DEFENSE.

00:38:34.178 --> 00:38:36.047
IT'LL GO BASICALLY INTO A HOLE

00:38:36.113 --> 00:38:37.181
IN THE GROUND THAT WILL NOT DO

00:38:37.248 --> 00:38:38.549
ANYTHING.

WE NEED TO REDUCE FOR WAIT TIMES

00:38:40.384 --> 00:38:42.253
TO HELP INCREASE.

00:38:42.319 --> 00:38:44.655
OUR ECONOMY THAT REQUIRES AN

00:38:44.722 --> 00:38:46.223
INVESTMENT TO HELP.

CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY WHICH WILL

BEFORE THEY START MAKING.

00:40:57.621 --> 00:41:00.024

EMERGENCY IS NOT.

00:41:17.808 --> 00:41:19.610
INCONSEQUENTIAL.

00:41:19.677 --> 00:41:21.078
PAST PRESIDENTS HAVE DECLARED

00:41:21.145 --> 00:41:22.780
NATIONAL EMERGENCY THAT WERE

00:41:22.847 --> 00:41:25.482
BASED ON FACTS AN ACTUAL

00:41:25.549 --> 00:41:27.451
EMERGENCIES BUT MOST OF THEM

00:41:27.518 --> 00:41:28.953
DEALT WITH FOREIGN CRISES IN

00:41:29.019 --> 00:41:30.621
TAKING ACTIONS AGAINST NATIONAL

00:41:30.688 --> 00:41:31.889
ADVERSARIES.

00:41:31.956 --> 00:41:34.291
NOT RE DIRECT THE MONEY WITHOUT

00:41:34.358 --> 00:41:35.926
CONGRESSIONAL APPROVAL.

00:41:35.993 --> 00:41:37.895
ONLY IN TWO OTHER INSTANCES HAVE

00:41:37.962 --> 00:41:39.330
EMERGENCY DECLARATIONS BEEN USED

00:41:39.396 --> 00:41:40.364
TO SPEND MONEY WITHOUT

NINETY DURING THE PERSIAN GULF

00:41:45.502 --> 00:41:45.970

00:41:46.036 --> 00:41:47.905
AND THE OTHER BY GEORGE W. BUSH

IN TWO THOUSAND ONE AFTER THE

00:41:50.541 --> 00:41:51.742
NINE ONE ONE ATTACKS.

00:41:51.809 --> 00:41:53.477
THE GOAL FOR THE NINE ONE ONE

00:41:53.544 --> 00:41:55.179
ATTACKS REQUIRE A MUCH DIFFERENT

00:41:55.246 --> 00:41:56.513
ACTION OF URGENCY BY OUR

00:41:56.580 --> 00:41:57.615
GOVERNMENT.

00:41:57.681 --> 00:41:59.650
THEN THE HUMANITARIAN CRISIS AT

00:41:59.717 --> 00:42:01.585
OUR BORDER.

00:42:01.652 --> 00:42:03.554
THE FACTS DO NOT SUPPORT THE

00:42:03.621 --> 00:42:04.989
ADMINISTRATION'S ARGUMENT

00:42:05.055 --> 00:42:06.090
AGAINST THE DANGERS AT THE

00:42:06.156 --> 00:42:07.258
SOUTHERN BORDER THEY SIMPLY DO

00:42:07.324 --> 00:42:08.859
NOT.

00:42:08.926 --> 00:42:10.227
THE DECLARATION OF EMERGENCY

00:42:10.294 --> 00:42:11.896
DIVERTED CRITICAL FUNDS AWAY

00:42:11.962 --> 00:42:13.464

SUPPORT HERE IN OUR VERY OWN

00:42:14.465 --> 00:42:16.100
STATE.

00:42:16.166 --> 00:42:18.102
I AM CLEAR THAT WHAT WE DECIDE

00:42:18.168 --> 00:42:20.638
TO FUND IS A STATEMENT OF WHAT

00:42:20.704 --> 00:42:22.239
WE VALUE.

00:42:22.306 --> 00:42:23.707
THIS RESOLUTION DECLARES OUR

00:42:23.774 --> 00:42:25.976
VALUES AS A STATE AND STANDS UP

00:42:26.043 --> 00:42:27.511
FOR THE SEPARATION OF POWERS

00:42:27.578 --> 00:42:30.147
OUTLINED IN OUR US CONSTITUTION

00:42:30.214 --> 00:42:32.549
AGAIN I STAND THE STRONG SUPPORT

00:42:32.616 --> 00:42:34.785
OF FDR [inaudible]

00:42:34.852 --> 00:42:39.556
TO SENATOR BELL.

00:42:39.623 --> 00:42:40.591
ABOUT PRESIDENT MEMBERS I

00:42:40.658 --> 00:42:42.893
SUPPORT THIS RESOLUTION WHEN.

00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:44.962
WHEN WE -- HAD -- THE

00:42:45.029 --> 00:42:48.465
DISCUSSIONS SO ON SB ONE THE

00:42:48.532 --> 00:42:51.702
TRANSPORTATION MEASURE -- SIR

00:42:51.769 --> 00:42:53.771
WELL SO ARE CENTER FROM SAN

00:42:53.837 --> 00:42:57.374
DIEGO EXCUSE ME -- HAD -- MUCH

00:42:57.441 --> 00:43:00.077
DISCUSSIONS ABOUT -- TO THE

00:43:00.144 --> 00:43:01.545
BORDER CROSSINGS IN THE FACT

00:43:01.612 --> 00:43:02.546
THAT CALIFORNIA.

00:43:02.613 --> 00:43:06.483
OF NEEDED -- TO HELP FINANCE THE

00:43:06.550 --> 00:43:08.719
BORDER CROSSINGS -- ALL ALONG

00:43:08.786 --> 00:43:11.355
THE BORDER AND WE WERE

00:43:11.422 --> 00:43:12.957
SUCCESSFUL IN [inaudible]

00:43:13.023 --> 00:43:15.192
PUTTING -- FUNDS.

00:43:15.259 --> 00:43:17.261
INTO THE OUT.

00:43:17.328 --> 00:43:18.195
ALL ALONG THERE ARE THEN IT

00:43:18.262 --> 00:43:19.930
SEEMS TO ME THAT WHEN YOU LOOK

00:43:19.997 --> 00:43:24.068
AT DRUG INTERDICTION AND THOSE

00:43:24.134 --> 00:43:24.635
KINDS OF PROGRAM THE BORDER

00:43:24.702 --> 00:43:26.737
CROSSINGS AND THE TECHNOLOGY AND

00:43:26.804 --> 00:43:28.038
THE IMPROVEMENT OF THOSE BORDER

00:43:28.105 --> 00:43:29.173
CROSSINGS.

00:43:29.239 --> 00:43:31.976
NOT ONLY HELPS TRADE WITH MEXICO

00:43:32.042 --> 00:43:33.811
BUT ALSO HELPS.

00:43:33.877 --> 00:43:37.648
WHERE IT'S -- THE STOPPING OF

00:43:37.715 --> 00:43:38.816
DRUGS COMING INTO THE COUNTRY

00:43:38.882 --> 00:43:41.151
BORDER WALL ACTUALLY DOES

00:43:41.218 --> 00:43:42.786
NOTHING TO DO THAT.

00:43:42.853 --> 00:43:43.954
SO I TOTALLY SUPPORT THIS

00:43:44.021 --> 00:43:44.955
RESOLUTION THE MONEY SHOULD BE

00:43:45.022 --> 00:43:46.523
SPARED.

00:43:46.590 --> 00:43:48.625
ON UPGRADING OUR AGING DEFENSE

00:43:48.692 --> 00:43:52.396
BILLS BILL TERRY INFRASTRUCTURE --

00:43:52.463 --> 00:43:54.465
THE MONEY SHOULD -- COME BACK TO

00:43:54.531 --> 00:43:57.434
CALIFORNIA -- THE NINE HUNDRED

00:43:57.501 --> 00:43:58.635
THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS.

00:43:58.702 --> 00:44:00.070
THAT IS BEEN TAKEN AWAY FROM THE

00:44:00.137 --> 00:44:03.707
HIGH SPEED RAIL -- PROJECT -- WE

00:44:03.774 --> 00:44:05.309
SHOULD HAVE A NATIONAL

00:44:05.376 --> 00:44:09.546
INFRASTRUCTURE -- PLAN. TO

00:44:09.613 --> 00:44:11.548
UPGRADE THE AGING --

00:44:11.615 --> 00:44:13.517
INFRASTRUCTURE ALL OVER THE

00:44:13.584 --> 00:44:15.285
UNITED STATES AS THE FALLING

00:44:15.352 --> 00:44:17.187
APART BECAUSE THE FEDERAL

00:44:17.254 --> 00:44:18.622
GOVERNMENT HAS INCREASED --

00:44:18.689 --> 00:44:20.824
FUNDING FOR INFRASTRUCTURE OVER

00:44:20.891 --> 00:44:23.827
THE LAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS.

00:44:23.894 --> 00:44:25.262
SO THERE'S OTHER PRIORITIES

00:44:25.329 --> 00:44:27.431
OTHER THAN BUILDING A WALL.

00:50:36.299 --> 00:50:37.434
THIS BILL TODAY BUT I THOUGHT IT

00:50:37.501 --> 00:50:41.705
WAS WORTH IT -- TO MAY I BRING

00:50:41.772 --> 00:50:46.143
UP SOME POINTS SO THE LAW THAT

00:50:46.209 --> 00:50:49.880
ENABLED CALIFORNIA. TO IN EFFECT

00:50:49.946 --> 00:50:52.482
REQUIRE INTERNET RETAILERS TO

00:50:52.549 --> 00:50:56.019
COLLECT SALES TAX WHICH THEY

00:50:56.086 --> 00:50:56.219
WERE.

00:50:56.286 --> 00:50:57.788
NOT.

00:50:57.854 --> 00:51:01.158
REQUIRED TECHNICALLY TO DO --

00:51:01.224 --> 00:51:02.959
PRIOR TO TWENTY ELEVEN SO

00:51:03.026 --> 00:51:04.728
CALIFORNIA'S SALES TAX LAW WAS

00:51:04.795 --> 00:51:06.830
BASED ON THAT YOU HAD TO HAVE A

00:51:06.897 --> 00:51:08.832
PHYSICAL PRESENCE IN CALIFORNIA

00:51:08.899 --> 00:51:10.500
BUT AS INTERNET SALES GREW.

00:51:10.567 --> 00:51:11.701
AND WE OBVIOUSLY SAW SOME

00:51:11.768 --> 00:51:14.271
COMPANIES BASICALLY DESIGN THEIR

00:51:14.337 --> 00:51:16.173
ENTIRE BUSINESS MODEL TO AVOID

00:51:16.239 --> 00:51:18.909
HAVING TO COLLECT SALES TAX.

00:51:18.975 --> 00:51:21.912
THE STATE'S -- COLLECTION OF

00:51:21.978 --> 00:51:24.047
SALES TAX BEGAN TO DROP -- AND

00:51:24.114 --> 00:51:25.982
YET EACH OF US AS INDIVIDUAL

00:51:26.049 --> 00:51:28.418
TAXPAYERS WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR

00:51:28.485 --> 00:51:29.719
THE IF WE BOUGHT SOMETHING

00:51:29.786 --> 00:51:31.655
EITHER OUT OF STATE FOR ON LINE.

00:51:31.721 --> 00:51:33.457
THAT HAD A SALES TAX BUT WE

00:51:33.523 --> 00:51:35.058
DIDN'T PAY IT DIRECTLY THEN WE

00:51:35.125 --> 00:51:36.827
WERE SUPPOSED TO PAY IT IS USE

00:51:36.893 --> 00:51:38.462
TAX NOW WHO'S IT HARDER TO

00:51:38.528 --> 00:51:40.230
COLLECT FROM THE FORTY MILLION

00:51:40.297 --> 00:51:42.666
CALIFORNIANS WHO MIGHT YOU KNOW.

00:51:42.732 --> 00:51:44.034
INDIVIDUALLY PURCHASED SOMETHING

00:51:44.100 --> 00:51:46.102
OR SOME HANDFUL AND WHEN I SEE

00:51:46.169 --> 00:51:47.471
HIM FOR ME IT'S MORE THAN A

00:51:47.537 --> 00:51:49.539
HANDFUL BUT IT'S LESS THAN FORTY

00:51:49.606 --> 00:51:51.475
MILLION CERTAINLY RETAILERS.

00:51:51.541 --> 00:51:53.777
SO IN TWENTY ELEVEN WE PASSED

00:51:53.844 --> 00:51:55.712
THE BILL THAT CREATED WHAT'S

00:51:55.779 --> 00:51:57.447
CALLED THE ALARM ON LONG ARM

00:51:57.514 --> 00:52:00.016
NEXUS WHICH MEANT WELL ANYWAY.

00:52:00.083 --> 00:52:02.786
WE'LL WE'LL LEAVE THAT

00:52:02.853 --> 00:52:03.820
EXPLANATION NOW.

00:52:03.887 --> 00:52:06.490
AT THAT POINT WE SET THE

00:52:06.556 --> 00:52:07.991
THRESHOLD AT ONE MILLION SO IN

00:52:08.058 --> 00:52:08.925
OTHER WORDS.

00:52:08.992 --> 00:52:10.527
ONLY.

00:52:10.594 --> 00:52:12.596
INTERNET SELLERS WITH SALES OF A

00:52:12.662 --> 00:52:14.965
MILLION OR ABOVE HAD TO COLLECT

00:52:15.031 --> 00:52:16.533
THAT SALES TAX INTERNET OVER THE

00:52:16.600 --> 00:52:18.702
STATE NO THAT WAS A COMPROMISE.

00:52:18.768 --> 00:52:20.470
THE OTHER STATES THAT HAD LAWS

00:52:20.537 --> 00:52:22.305
NEW YORK STATE FOR EXAMPLE IN

00:52:22.372 --> 00:52:25.175
OTHERS NONE OF THEM HAD IT BELOW

00:52:25.242 --> 00:52:25.876
TWO HUNDRED FIFTY K..

00:52:25.942 --> 00:52:27.477
SO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY K. WAS THE

00:52:27.544 --> 00:52:30.113
NORMAL THRESHOLD BUT WE SET IT

00:52:30.180 --> 00:52:31.081
AT A MILLION.

00:52:31.147 --> 00:52:33.350
NOW WE ARE TAKING UP THIS BILL

00:52:33.416 --> 00:52:36.720
BECAUSE THE COURT RULED IN THE

00:52:36.786 --> 00:52:38.021
WAY FAIRS CASE THAT.

00:52:38.088 --> 00:52:38.688
HEY.

00:52:38.755 --> 00:52:39.823
YOU DON'T EVEN NEED THE LONG ARM

00:52:39.890 --> 00:52:42.626
NEXUS EVERY SELLER OF A HUNDRED

00:52:42.692 --> 00:52:43.994
THOUSAND AND ABOVE.

00:52:44.060 --> 00:52:45.896
SHOULD BE ABLE TO COLLECT THE

00:52:45.962 --> 00:52:48.131
SALES TAX IN STATE SHOULD BE

00:52:48.198 --> 00:52:49.199
ABLE TO REMOTE IT.

00:52:49.266 --> 00:52:50.000
OR GET IT.

00:52:50.066 --> 00:52:53.103
SO I RAISE THAT BECAUSE THE BILL

00:52:53.169 --> 00:52:54.771
THAT'S BEFORE US TODAY WHILE A

00:52:54.838 --> 00:52:56.840
GREAT IMPROVEMENT OVER WHAT WE

00:52:56.907 --> 00:52:57.841
CURRENTLY HAVE.

00:52:57.908 --> 00:52:59.476
WHICH IS CURRENTLY WE HAVE THE

00:52:59.543 --> 00:53:02.879
ONE MILLION SO THIS BRINGS IT TO

00:53:02.946 --> 00:53:03.446
FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND STORE

00:53:03.513 --> 00:53:04.281
CAPTURE SOME MORE.

00:53:04.347 --> 00:53:07.150
IT STILL DOES NOT CAPTURE ALL

00:53:07.217 --> 00:53:09.519
INTERNET SALES NOW THE ARGUMENT

00:53:09.586 --> 00:53:11.221
THAT SOME WOULD GIVE IS THAT

00:53:11.288 --> 00:53:14.758
WELL THAT GAP BETWEEN SAY

00:53:14.824 --> 00:53:16.092
500-100-0100 THOUSAND IS NOT

00:53:16.159 --> 00:53:17.827
THAT MANY SELLERS AND IT'S A LOT

00:53:17.894 --> 00:53:19.629
OF HASSLE TO GO AFTER THOSE

00:53:19.696 --> 00:53:21.398
PEOPLE TO COLLECT THAT SALES TAX.

00:53:21.464 --> 00:53:23.333
WELL WHAT'S MORE OF A HASSLE

00:53:23.400 --> 00:53:25.101
GOING AFTER EACH OF US

00:53:25.168 --> 00:53:26.636
INDIVIDUAL TAXPAYERS THE

00:53:26.703 --> 00:53:29.439
COLLECTOR USE TAX OR THOSE

00:53:29.506 --> 00:53:31.441
SELLERS OVER A HUNDRED KA NOW

00:53:31.508 --> 00:53:33.109
WHAT I WOULD ALSO NOTE.

00:53:33.176 --> 00:53:34.377
IS.

00:53:34.444 --> 00:53:36.379
EVERY BRICK AND MORTAR BUSINESS

00:53:36.446 --> 00:53:38.281
IN CALIFORNIA REGARDLESS OF

00:53:38.348 --> 00:53:40.250
THEIR SIZE EVEN IF THEIR SALES

00:53:40.317 --> 00:53:42.686
ARE ONLY FIVE KA YEAR OR TEN K.

00:53:42.752 --> 00:53:45.422
YEAR MUST COLLECT SALES TAX.

00:53:45.488 --> 00:53:47.857
SO THIS OSTENSIBLY BEING NICE TO

00:53:47.924 --> 00:53:49.526
SMALL BUSINESS IS ONLY BEING

00:53:49.593 --> 00:53:51.194
NICE TO SMALL BUSINESSES OUT OF

00:53:51.261 --> 00:53:52.495
CALIFORNIA.

00:53:52.562 --> 00:53:54.598
SO WE ARE ALLOWING BUSINESSES

00:53:54.664 --> 00:53:56.566
OUT OF CALIFORNIA THAT HAVE

00:53:56.633 --> 00:53:58.969
SALES BETWEEN A HUNDRED THOUSAND

00:53:59.035 --> 00:54:00.604
AND FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND NOT TO

00:54:00.670 --> 00:54:02.072
HAVE TO COLLECT OUR SALES TAX SO

00:54:02.138 --> 00:54:04.441
IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE MAY WANT

00:54:04.507 --> 00:54:05.709
TO CORRECT IN THE FUTURE.

00:54:05.775 --> 00:54:07.243
BUT I SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY

00:54:07.310 --> 00:54:08.979
BECAUSE IT IS AN IMPROVEMENT AND

00:54:09.045 --> 00:54:10.413
IT DOES ALLOW US TO COLLECT SOME

00:54:10.480 --> 00:54:13.116
TAX STARTING NOW IN APRIL BUT I

00:54:13.183 --> 00:54:15.485
HOPE THAT WE WOULD ADDRESS IT

00:54:15.552 --> 00:54:17.854
AND DO WHAT THE WAY FAIR

00:54:17.921 --> 00:54:19.522
DECISION WOULD ALLOW US.

00:54:19.589 --> 00:54:20.757
TO IS THERE ANY FURTHER

00:54:20.824 --> 00:54:21.324
