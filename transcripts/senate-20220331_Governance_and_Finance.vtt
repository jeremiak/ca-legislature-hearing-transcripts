00:39:28.666 --> 00:39:30.234
ISSUE I'VE BEEN- A STRONG

00:39:30.301 --> 00:39:34.205
SUPPORTER OF- ENDING- MINIMUM

00:39:34.271 --> 00:39:36.373
PARKING REQUIREMENTS- BOTH WHEN

00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:38.976
I WAS ON THE BOARD SUPERVISORS-

00:39:39.043 --> 00:39:40.344
IN SUPPORTING LEGISLATION LAST

00:39:40.411 --> 00:39:41.312
YEAR OR BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER

00:39:41.378 --> 00:39:43.247
FRIEDMAN. I CONTINUE TO SUPPORT

00:39:43.314 --> 00:39:45.549
HER BELL AND I'M GLAD THAT THERE

00:39:45.616 --> 00:39:48.152
IS AN I. I THINK THE MORE THE

00:39:48.219 --> 00:39:49.520
MERRIER IN THIS CONVERSATION- WE

00:39:49.587 --> 00:39:52.323
VERY CLEAR THAT PARKING

00:39:52.389 --> 00:39:56.594
MANDATES- ARE ANTI HOUSING- DIED

00:39:56.660 --> 00:39:58.429
IS NOT ABOUT ENDING PARKING IN

00:39:58.496 --> 00:39:59.930
NEW CONSTRUCTION. PEOPLE WHO

00:39:59.997 --> 00:40:02.166
BUILD HOUSING ARE GOING TO WANT

00:40:02.233 --> 00:40:05.569
TO HAVE WHATEVER WORKS FOR IT SO

00:40:05.636 --> 00:40:08.539
THAT THEY CAN SELL OR RENT OUT-

00:40:08.606 --> 00:40:10.741
FIVE HOMES- AND IF NOT HAVING

00:40:10.808 --> 00:40:12.443
ANY PARKING IN A PROJECT IS

00:40:12.510 --> 00:40:14.678
GOING TO HARM THEIR ABILITY TO

00:40:14.745 --> 00:40:16.480
DO THAT THEY'RE GOING TO PUT.

00:40:16.547 --> 00:40:17.748
SOME LEVEL OF PARKING AND- BUT

00:40:17.815 --> 00:40:19.517
HAVING A ONE SIZE FITS ALL YOU

00:40:19.583 --> 00:40:21.886
MUST DO AT LEAST ONE PERSON ONE

00:40:21.952 --> 00:40:24.188
PARKING SPOT PER UNIT OR TWO PER

00:40:24.255 --> 00:40:29.527
UNITS- REALLY UNDERMINES THAT.

00:40:29.593 --> 00:40:31.695
GOAL AND WHAT IT DOES IS A FEW

00:40:31.762 --> 00:40:32.630
THINGS. AND WE KNOW FOR INDIAN

00:40:32.696 --> 00:40:34.331
I'M GETTING ALICE THAT A REAL

00:40:34.398 --> 00:40:36.467
GOOD JOB OF LAYING OUT SOME OF

00:40:36.534 --> 00:40:37.101
THE SIGNIFICANT DOWNSIDES. OF

00:40:37.168 --> 00:40:40.204
MANDATING PARKING AN OVERSUPPLY

00:40:40.271 --> 00:40:42.740
OF PARKING BY INCLUDING MAKING

00:40:42.807 --> 00:40:45.409
HOUSING MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE. AND

00:40:45.476 --> 00:40:47.912
REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF HOUSING-

00:40:47.978 --> 00:40:49.647
THAT YOU- THAT IS DELIVERED

00:40:49.713 --> 00:40:50.981
BECAUSE YOU ONLY HAVE SO MANY

00:40:51.048 --> 00:40:53.117
SQUARE FEET OF BUILD SOMETHING.

00:40:53.184 --> 00:40:54.552
AND IF IT'S MANDATED THAT YOU

00:40:54.618 --> 00:40:55.953
MUST DEDICATE A REALLY HIGH

00:40:56.020 --> 00:40:58.556
PERCENTAGE. OF THAT SQUARE

00:40:58.622 --> 00:41:00.124
FOOTAGE THE PARKING THAT MEANS

00:41:00.191 --> 00:41:02.860
FEWER HOMES ARE BEING BILL AND

00:41:02.927 --> 00:41:05.095
WE'RE MAKING THAT CHOICE THAT

00:41:05.162 --> 00:41:06.297
YOU KNOW A LIVING SPACE FOR A

00:41:06.363 --> 00:41:08.299
CAR IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN A

00:41:08.365 --> 00:41:10.467
LIVING SPACE FOR HUMAN BEINGS-

00:41:10.534 --> 00:41:13.537
SO IT'S LONG PAST DUE THAT WE

00:41:13.604 --> 00:41:14.705
MOVE AWAY FROM THIS PARKING-

00:41:14.772 --> 00:41:16.507
MINIMUMS AND I APPRECIATE THE

00:41:16.574 --> 00:41:18.642
AUTHOR. I THINK IT IS I ALSO

00:41:18.709 --> 00:41:20.611
APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR HAS BEEN

00:41:20.678 --> 00:41:22.379
TAKING FEEDBACK AND MAKING.

00:41:22.446 --> 00:41:24.381
CHANGES TO THE BILL- AND DOING

00:41:24.448 --> 00:41:26.016
THAT ON HIS OWN WITHOUT BEING

00:41:26.083 --> 00:41:28.719
FORCED TO DO IT- AND LISTENING-

00:41:28.786 --> 00:41:30.187
AND I KNOW THAT THAT WILL

00:41:30.254 --> 00:41:32.556
CONTINUE- I. WILL CENTERS OF THE

I'VE BEEN A STRONG SUPPORTER OF

00:41:39.630 --> 00:41:40.664
ELECTRIC VEHICLES AND MAKING

00:41:40.731 --> 00:41:41.899
SURE THAT PEOPLE CAN PLUG THEM

00:41:41.966 --> 00:41:43.567
IN. I WHERE THEY LIVE I DON'T

00:41:43.634 --> 00:41:45.870
THINK THAT THAT IS AN ARGUMENT

00:41:45.936 --> 00:41:47.204
FOR HAVING MORE PARKING. I KNOW

00:41:47.271 --> 00:41:48.706
IT'S AN ARGUMENT FOR WHATEVER

00:41:48.772 --> 00:41:52.042
PARKING WE DO HAVE- MAKING SURE

00:41:52.109 --> 00:41:54.044
THAT THERE IS A IS ACCESS FOR

00:41:54.111 --> 00:41:55.512
ELECTRIC VEHICLES AND IT'S NOT

00:41:55.579 --> 00:41:57.815
ONLY FOR GAS VEHICLES. TALKING

THERE'S TWO OPTIONS ONE IS THAT

00:44:21.558 --> 00:44:24.361
IT MUST YOU KNOW IF IT HAS MEETS

00:44:24.428 --> 00:44:27.197
A 25% A MINIMUM OF AFFORDABLE

00:44:27.264 --> 00:44:30.134
HOUSING. OR THEN THERE'S THE

00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:32.169
OTHER OPTION COULD YOU EXPLAIN

00:44:32.236 --> 00:44:34.538
HOW THE TO WORK TOGETHER BECAUSE

00:44:34.605 --> 00:44:35.973
I WANT TO END UP WITH MORE

AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT'S WHERE

00:44:38.609 --> 00:44:41.979
WE HAVE OF. THE GREATEST CRISIS

00:44:42.046 --> 00:44:45.049
WE JUST TALKED ABOUT RENTER'S-

00:44:45.115 --> 00:44:46.550

00:44:46.617 --> 00:44:48.152
FLOOR ON ON ON RENTER'S

00:44:48.218 --> 00:44:51.121

HOUSING PERIOD. THANK YOU KNOW

00:44:56.260 --> 00:44:56.894
IT'S A GREAT QUESTION AND

00:44:56.960 --> 00:44:58.629
BASICALLY WHAT I'VE TRIED TO DO

00:44:58.695 --> 00:45:00.731
IS TO CREATE TO PASS ONE WITH A

00:45:00.798 --> 00:45:02.733
GREATER INCENTIVE WHICHIS FOR

00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:03.667
AFFORDABLE AND WORKFORCE HOUSING

00:45:03.734 --> 00:45:05.936
AND AS THE L. A. TIMES IN AN

00:45:06.003 --> 00:45:06.670
EDITORIAL NOTED I THINK ABOUT

00:45:06.737 --> 00:45:08.072
THREE WEEKS AGO. CALIFORNIA

00:45:08.138 --> 00:45:10.107
NEEDS HOUSING ACROSS THE

00:45:10.174 --> 00:45:11.642
SPECTRUM WE NEED ALL TYPES OF

00:45:11.708 --> 00:45:12.976
HOUSING BUT WE NEED AFFORDABLE

00:45:13.043 --> 00:45:15.446
HOUSING MORE SO THAN THAT'S THE

00:45:15.512 --> 00:45:18.282
MOST CRITICAL NEED- SO I TRIED

00:45:18.348 --> 00:45:19.416
TO SORT OF CREATE AN INCENTIVE

00:45:19.483 --> 00:45:21.351
WHERE THERE'S AN EASIER PATH

00:45:21.418 --> 00:45:22.986
FORWARD. IF YOU'RE GONNA DO

00:45:23.053 --> 00:45:24.788
AFFORDABLE AND WORKFORCE HOUSING

00:45:24.855 --> 00:45:25.489
YOU GET OVER THE COUNTER

00:45:25.556 --> 00:45:27.458
APPROVAL. IF YOU'RE GONNA DO

00:45:27.524 --> 00:45:28.892
MARKET RATE HOUSING I STILL

00:45:28.959 --> 00:45:30.427
WANTED TO CREATE A PROCESS BUT

00:45:30.494 --> 00:45:32.196
WITHIN THAT PROCESS HAVE SOME

00:45:32.262 --> 00:45:33.931
SAFEGUARDS FOR COMMUNITIES THAT

00:45:33.997 --> 00:45:35.365
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO NEGATIVELY

00:45:35.432 --> 00:45:37.568
IMPACT THE ARENA APPROACH SO. IF

00:45:37.634 --> 00:45:39.703
YOU CAN SHOW THAT YOUR MARKET

00:45:39.770 --> 00:45:41.171
RATE HOUSING PRODUCTION IS NOT

00:45:41.238 --> 00:45:42.840
GOING TO IMPACT THAT CITY'S

00:45:42.906 --> 00:45:44.374
ABILITY TO PROVIDE AFFORDABLE

00:45:44.441 --> 00:45:48.112
HOUSING AND SOME OTHER LOCAL

00:45:48.178 --> 00:45:49.880
HAVE A PASSED SO I'M TRYING TO

00:45:49.947 --> 00:45:50.848
INCENTIVIZE ONE. BY MAKING THAT

00:45:50.914 --> 00:45:52.850
PATH EASIER BUT NOT SHUT THE

00:45:52.916 --> 00:45:55.319
DOOR ON THE OTHER COMPLETELY IF

00:45:55.385 --> 00:45:56.353
YOU MEET THOSE CERTAIN

00:45:56.420 --> 00:45:58.188
SAFEGUARDS AND SELF I'M TRYING

00:45:58.255 --> 00:45:59.423
TO HIT THE SWEET SPOT BECAUSE AS

00:45:59.490 --> 00:46:01.191
YOU KNOW WITH WITH PRIOR

00:46:01.258 --> 00:46:03.060
LEGISLATION AND I KNOW- THE

00:46:03.127 --> 00:46:06.230
CHAIR OF HOUSING- IS A IS A BIG.

00:46:06.296 --> 00:46:08.432
PROPONENT OF THAT WITH PRIOR

00:46:08.499 --> 00:46:10.434
LEGISLATION- IT WAS JUST TO DO

00:46:10.501 --> 00:46:12.669
AWAY WITH PARKING MINIMUMS WITH

00:46:12.736 --> 00:46:14.104
NO. CONDITIONS IN THERE ISN'T

00:46:14.171 --> 00:46:18.041
THERE IS A BODY OF DATA TO SHOW

00:46:18.108 --> 00:46:19.076
THAT THAT IS AN EFFECTIVE

00:46:19.143 --> 00:46:21.211
STRATEGY THAT THERE'S BEEN SOME

00:46:21.278 --> 00:46:23.213
SUCCESS BUT IN MY MIND MAKING

00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:24.915
SURE THAT WE INCENTIVIZE THE

00:46:24.982 --> 00:46:26.884
AFFORDABLE PIECE IS THE PROPER

00:46:26.950 --> 00:46:28.385
TRADE OFF MAKING IT AN EASIER

00:46:28.452 --> 00:46:30.721
PATH AND I GO BACK TO. SOMETHING

00:46:30.787 --> 00:46:31.555
FROM MY LOCAL GOVERNMENT DAYS%

00:46:31.622 --> 00:46:32.856
WHERE THEY SAID CREATE AN

00:46:32.923 --> 00:46:33.457
INCENTIVE TO WHERE YOU WANT

00:46:33.524 --> 00:46:35.259
PEOPLE TO GO WHETHER THAT'S

00:46:35.325 --> 00:46:36.426
HAVING AN EASIER PATH FOR A

00:46:36.493 --> 00:46:37.995
SINGLE STORY VERSUS A TWO STORY

00:46:38.061 --> 00:46:40.030
AND THAT'S THAT WAS SORT OF THE

00:46:40.097 --> 00:46:41.365
APPROACH SHOULDN'T AND LAST YEAR

00:46:41.431 --> 00:46:45.035
WHEN I HELD. THE BILL FOLKS SAID

00:46:45.102 --> 00:46:46.136
WELL PORTANTINO WHAT'S YOUR

00:46:46.203 --> 00:46:48.038
ALTERNATIVE AND SO I TOOK THAT

00:46:48.105 --> 00:46:49.373
CHALLENGE SERIOUSLY AND THIS IS

00:46:49.439 --> 00:46:50.774
MY ATTEMPT TO TRY TO HIT THAT

00:46:50.841 --> 00:46:53.177
SWEET SPOT AND BALANCE YOUR

00:46:53.243 --> 00:46:53.877
CONCERNS ON THE AFFORDABLE

00:46:53.944 --> 00:46:56.146
HOUSING PIECE IN THE WORK FORCE

00:46:56.213 --> 00:46:58.549

00:46:58.615 --> 00:47:00.217
FOLKS WHO THINK THE MARKET. WILL

00:47:00.284 --> 00:47:01.652
WILL DELIVER THOSE THANKS I'M

00:47:01.718 --> 00:47:03.287
TRYING TO HIT THAT SWEET SPOT.

00:47:03.353 --> 00:47:04.888
AND FRANKLY I THINK BOTH SIDES

00:47:04.955 --> 00:47:06.523
ARE LITTLE ONE EVEN. ARE UNEASY

00:47:06.590 --> 00:47:08.392
WHICH MEANS I'M PROBABLY CLOSE

00:47:08.458 --> 00:47:12.863
TO THAT TO THAT SWEET SPOT- ONE

00:47:12.930 --> 00:47:14.898
OF MY CONCERNS WITH ANOTHER

00:47:14.965 --> 00:47:17.367
ANOTHER VERSION OF THIS BILL AS

00:47:17.434 --> 00:47:18.602
FAR AS PARKING REQUIREMENTS IS

00:47:18.669 --> 00:47:21.438
THAT- THERE WOULD BE PARKING FOR

00:47:21.505 --> 00:47:23.207
ELECTRIC VEHICLES I DON'T KNOW

00:47:23.273 --> 00:47:24.541
WHERE IT YOUR BILL SOUNDS WITH

00:47:24.608 --> 00:47:26.877
THAT BUT- HERE WE GO AGAIN WITH

00:47:26.944 --> 00:47:30.514
EQUITY ISSUES RIGHT SO IF YOU

00:47:30.581 --> 00:47:33.183

00:47:33.250 --> 00:47:35.252
THERE WILL BE PARKING FOR YOU

00:47:35.319 --> 00:47:37.421
THAT DOES TAKE UP THE SPACE FOR

00:47:37.487 --> 00:47:40.324
AN ANOTHER UNIT OF HOUSING BUT

00:47:40.390 --> 00:47:42.793
DON'T USE THE OTHER KIND OF

00:47:42.859 --> 00:47:45.696
AUTOMOBILE WHICH IS WHAT MOST

00:47:45.762 --> 00:47:47.331
LOW INCOME MODERATE INCOME

00:47:47.397 --> 00:47:48.966
PEOPLE HAVE BECAUSE THAT'S ALL

00:47:49.032 --> 00:47:51.602
THEY CAN AFFORD- SO IT TO ME

00:47:51.668 --> 00:47:54.071
IT'S LIKE WAIT A MINUTE I

00:47:54.137 --> 00:47:55.205
THOUGHT I THOUGHT WE WERE TRYING

00:47:55.272 --> 00:47:56.740
TO GET TO MORE HOUSING BUT

00:47:56.807 --> 00:47:59.142

GET THE INPUT AND CONTINUE BUT I

00:48:49.226 --> 00:48:52.963
DO THINK. THERE'S A ROLE FOR US

00:48:53.030 --> 00:48:54.865
TO PLAY. IN DEFINING WHAT WE

00:48:54.931 --> 00:48:55.699
WANT OUT OF THIS PARKING

00:48:55.766 --> 00:48:57.701
DISCUSSION AND I THINK AGAIN

00:48:57.768 --> 00:48:59.469
GOING BACK WITH THE L. A. TIMES

00:48:59.536 --> 00:49:01.038
SAID WE NEED HOUSING. BUT WE

NEED MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING

00:49:02.339 --> 00:49:04.107
THAN THAN OTHERS AND SO THAT'S

00:49:04.174 --> 00:49:05.809

EVEN IF THEY START. BEING A

00:49:16.820 --> 00:49:19.156
LITTLE BIT MORE. LESS EXPENSIVE

00:49:19.222 --> 00:49:20.691
THAN IF IT HAD PARKING OVER

00:49:20.757 --> 00:49:22.659
TIME. THE DESIRABILITY WILL

00:49:22.726 --> 00:49:24.127
DRIVE UP THOSE COSTS AND THEN

00:49:24.194 --> 00:49:26.863
WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO. PRICE

ELEGANT SOLUTION INTO THAT BILL

01:10:46.775 --> 01:10:48.577
AND THE WAY WE DID IT WAS VERY

01:10:48.644 --> 01:10:50.446
STREAMLINED. OR ESSENTIALLY THE

01:10:50.512 --> 01:10:52.247

CODE MATCHES UP WITH WHAT'S ON

01:10:59.555 --> 01:11:00.756
THE WEBSITE STATE WATER BOARD

01:11:00.823 --> 01:11:01.790
THEN THEY NEED TO PROVIDE ONE

01:11:01.857 --> 01:11:03.259
MORE IDENTIFICATION NUMBER THAT

01:11:03.325 --> 01:11:05.127
THEY DID PROPERLY IN ROLE IS

01:11:05.194 --> 01:11:07.129
VERY ELEGANT SOLUTION- AND BUT

01:11:07.196 --> 01:11:08.330
IT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE

01:11:08.397 --> 01:11:09.698
IT LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD

01:11:09.765 --> 01:11:11.467
BETWEEN ALL INDUSTRIES. I THEN

01:11:11.533 --> 01:11:13.535
HAD TO UNROLL IT ON THIS PERMIT

01:11:13.602 --> 01:11:15.571
BEFORE TWO OH FIVE WE ESTIMATE

01:11:15.638 --> 01:11:17.072
THERE WAS OVER TWENTY THOUSAND

01:11:17.139 --> 01:11:18.741
NON FILERS WHICH WERE CALLING

01:11:18.807 --> 01:11:19.875
PEOPLE THAT DIDN'T STOP AND ROLL

01:11:19.942 --> 01:11:21.844
INTO THE UNDER THE PERMIT- WE

01:11:21.910 --> 01:11:24.313
ARE BIPARTISAN SUPPORT- AND IT'S

01:11:24.380 --> 01:11:26.548
BEEN LARGELY VERY SUCCESSFUL-

01:11:26.615 --> 01:11:28.083
THROUGH THE TWO YEARS OF

01:11:28.150 --> 01:11:29.418
IMPLEMENTATION- CENTER HERTZBERG

01:11:29.485 --> 01:11:31.286
MENTIONED THE TWO THOUSAND-

01:11:31.353 --> 01:11:34.289
INDUSTRIAL PROPERTIES BUT OVER

01:11:34.356 --> 01:11:35.357
SEVEN THOUSAND FOLKS THAT WERE

01:11:35.424 --> 01:11:37.426
NON FILED BEFORE. HAVE NOW

01:11:37.493 --> 01:11:38.494
EITHER ENROLLED EITHER GOT AN

01:11:38.560 --> 01:11:40.195
EXEMPTION OR ARE UNDER THE

01:11:40.262 --> 01:11:42.231
PERMIT SO THE BILL IN THE

01:11:42.297 --> 01:11:44.366
PROGRAM IS WORKING THERE WERE

01:11:44.433 --> 01:11:45.234
SOME PROBLEMS DURING

01:11:45.300 --> 01:11:47.002
IMPLEMENTATION AS CENTER EXPERT

01:11:47.069 --> 01:11:48.570
MENTIONED SOME OF THE CITIES

01:11:48.637 --> 01:11:50.773
CALL IT BY A DIFFERENT NAME IT'S

01:11:50.839 --> 01:11:52.041
NOT A LICENSES THE CERTIFICATE-

01:11:52.107 --> 01:11:54.076
AND THEN ALSO SOME INFORMATION

01:11:54.143 --> 01:11:56.245
WASN'T NECESSARILY PROVIDED-

01:11:56.311 --> 01:11:58.180
WHEN PUBLIC WOULD REQUESTED AND

01:11:58.247 --> 01:11:59.748
SO THAT ALL THERE IS A LARGE

01:11:59.815 --> 01:12:00.949
AMOUNT OF EXEMPTIONS THAT THESE

01:12:01.016 --> 01:12:02.017
INDUSTRIES SELF PROCLAIMED THAT

01:12:02.084 --> 01:12:04.586
THEY HAD AND SO WE JUST WANT TO

01:12:04.653 --> 01:12:08.857
VERIFY. THAT THOSE EXEMPTIONS

01:12:08.924 --> 01:12:11.093
ARE PROPER AND THAT'S ALL A LOT

01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:12.494
WITH BILL DOES AS WELL. I'M

01:12:12.561 --> 01:12:13.562
SOMEONE TOUCH ON THREE QUICK IS

01:12:13.629 --> 01:12:16.365
THAT WAS IN THE AND NOW. OF THE

01:12:16.432 --> 01:12:17.199
BETWEEN LICENSE SINCE. AGAIN

01:12:17.266 --> 01:12:18.767
WHEN YOU'RE DOING SB TWO OH FIVE

01:12:18.834 --> 01:12:20.836
THAT WAS LARGELY THE CONCERN WE

01:12:20.903 --> 01:12:21.804
GOT WAS THAT A BUSINESS LICENSE

01:12:21.870 --> 01:12:23.238
IS REALLY JUST AN OPPORTUNITY TO

01:12:23.305 --> 01:12:24.973
TAKE SOME FUNDING- THERE'S NOT

01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:25.574
REALLY REGULATORY PROCESS TO

01:12:25.641 --> 01:12:26.775
BACK AND WE WANT TO STICK WITH

01:12:26.842 --> 01:12:29.211
THAT WE DON'T WANT TO ADD ANY

01:12:29.278 --> 01:12:29.845
TYPE OF REGULATORY PROCESS AND

01:12:29.912 --> 01:12:31.647
WE GET TO THAT IN A SECOND. BUT

01:12:31.714 --> 01:12:34.650
THE IDEA IS SIMPLY TO LOOK IT UP

01:12:34.717 --> 01:12:36.218
S. I. C. CODE NUMBER AND MATCH

01:12:36.285 --> 01:12:38.153
IT UP NOT TO MAKE ANY REGULATORY

01:12:38.220 --> 01:12:41.056
DECISIONS AND WE SPUR STICKING

01:12:41.123 --> 01:12:42.224
WITH THAT HERE IN SB EIGHT.

01:12:42.291 --> 01:12:43.492
EIGHT NINE ONE- AND THEN THE

01:12:43.559 --> 01:12:44.626
SECOND ISSUE I WE'VE BEEN

01:12:44.693 --> 01:12:46.795
DIGGING INTO. THE CITIES THAT DO

01:12:46.862 --> 01:12:48.297
HAVE BUSINESS CERTIFICATES. AND

01:12:48.363 --> 01:12:50.399
THEY SEEM TO BE NO DIFFERENT IN

01:12:50.466 --> 01:12:51.800
PRACTICE THAN A BUSINESS LICENSE

01:12:51.867 --> 01:12:53.335
OTHER THAN THE NAME. MANY

01:12:53.402 --> 01:12:54.670
CERTIFICATES ASK FOR CERTAIN

01:12:54.737 --> 01:12:56.739
THINGS LIKE. SB TWO FIVE DID

01:12:56.805 --> 01:12:58.540
FORCIBLY G. ME DIFFERENT

01:12:58.607 --> 01:13:00.442
ORDINANCES. AND YOU CHECK THE

01:13:00.509 --> 01:13:01.910
BOX YES I'VE- APPLIED AND YOU

01:13:01.977 --> 01:13:03.112
KNOW PASS THIS ORDINANCE NOT

01:13:03.178 --> 01:13:05.380
THAT. TO THE IT'S ESSENTIALLY

01:13:05.447 --> 01:13:07.382
THE SAME AS A LICENSE OTHER THAN

01:13:07.449 --> 01:13:08.617
THE NAME. OF THE SECOND ISSUE

01:13:08.684 --> 01:13:09.685
THERE WAS AN ISSUE ABOUT THE

01:13:09.752 --> 01:13:11.420
PUBLIC RECORDS ACT REQUEST THAT

01:13:11.487 --> 01:13:12.621
WAS IDENTIFIED THE ANALYSIS AND

01:13:12.688 --> 01:13:13.522
I WOULD AGREE- WE'RE WE'RE

01:13:13.589 --> 01:13:14.790
ACTUALLY WORKING ON SOME

01:13:14.857 --> 01:13:16.125
POTENTIAL AMENDMENTS NOW. TO

01:13:16.191 --> 01:13:17.726
MAKE IT A LOT MORE CLEAR OF

01:13:17.793 --> 01:13:19.495
EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET

01:13:19.561 --> 01:13:20.696
NOT A FULL PUBLIC RECORDS ACT

01:13:20.763 --> 01:13:21.630
REQUEST. CITIES AND COUNTIES

01:13:21.697 --> 01:13:23.866
ALREADY. NEED TO DISCLOSE DATE

01:13:23.932 --> 01:13:25.334
NAME AND ADDRESS OF THE

01:13:25.400 --> 01:13:27.770
APPLICANT- THAT APPLIED FOR THE

01:13:27.836 --> 01:13:29.104
LICENSE. ALL WE'RE ASKING TO ADD

01:13:29.171 --> 01:13:30.572
TO THAT IS THE IDENTIFICATION

01:13:30.639 --> 01:13:32.341
NUMBER THAT THEY PROVIDED SAYING

01:13:32.407 --> 01:13:33.575
THAT THEY'RE- COVERED UNDER THE

01:13:33.642 --> 01:13:35.043
INDUSTRIAL STORMWATER PERMIT. SO

01:13:35.110 --> 01:13:36.845
NOT TRYING TO OPEN IT UP FOR ANY

01:13:36.912 --> 01:13:38.413
TYPE OF TAX OR FINANCIAL

01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:39.448
INFORMATION. SO WE'RE GONNA.

01:13:39.515 --> 01:13:40.949
TAKE AMENDMENTS TO NARROW THAT

01:13:41.016 --> 01:13:42.985
TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT CONCERN

01:13:43.051 --> 01:13:44.319
IS ALLEVIATED. AND THE LAST ONE

01:13:44.386 --> 01:13:45.921
AND IT'S IN SUBSECTION I'D BUT-

01:13:45.988 --> 01:13:47.022
ON IT WAS REFERENCING THE

01:13:47.089 --> 01:13:48.657
ANALYSIS AND I DON'T NECESSARILY

01:13:48.724 --> 01:13:51.193
AGREE WITH- THE WAY. SOME FOLKS

01:13:51.260 --> 01:13:52.728
ARE READING IT BUT- THAT

01:13:52.795 --> 01:13:55.497
PROVISION- IS BEING READ TO SAY

01:13:55.564 --> 01:13:56.665
THAT IF YOU DON'T HAVE A

01:13:56.732 --> 01:13:57.933
BUSINESS LICENSE OR CERTIFICATE

01:13:58.000 --> 01:13:59.802
OR ANY TYPE OF THAT TYPE OF

01:13:59.868 --> 01:14:01.537
PROGRAM. YOU ESSENTIALLY MIGHT

01:14:01.603 --> 01:14:02.171
NEED TO CREATE ONE HUNDRED EIGHT

01:14:02.237 --> 01:14:03.772
NINETY ONE. IT'S THE COMPLETE

01:14:03.839 --> 01:14:04.773
OPPOSITE ACTUALLY WHAT WE'RE

01:14:04.840 --> 01:14:05.607
TRYING TO WE'RE TRYING TO

01:14:05.674 --> 01:14:06.875
CLARIFY. THAT THE CITY OR THE

01:14:06.942 --> 01:14:09.077
COUNTY HAS NO. REGULATORY

01:14:09.144 --> 01:14:10.779
DECISION THAT THEY HAVE TO MAKE

01:14:10.846 --> 01:14:11.947
ON WHETHER THEY HAVE TO COMPLY

01:14:12.014 --> 01:14:13.582
WITH THE PERMANENT NOT. THAT'S A

01:14:13.649 --> 01:14:15.584
REALLY BIG ISSUE WITH SOME OF

01:14:15.651 --> 01:14:16.351
THE- LEAST CITIES AND THE

01:14:16.418 --> 01:14:17.953
COUNTIES BACK INTO A FIVE. WE

01:14:18.020 --> 01:14:19.454
WANT TO MAKE SURE WE HONOR THAT

01:14:19.521 --> 01:14:20.756
COMMITMENT. THATWE'RE NOT

01:14:20.823 --> 01:14:21.790
REQUIRING ANY TYPE OF NEW

01:14:21.857 --> 01:14:23.292
REGULATORY DECISION MAKING

01:14:23.358 --> 01:14:25.627
PROCESS. SO I'M COMMITTED- I

01:14:25.694 --> 01:14:27.596
KNOW WE CAN WORK ON THE LANGUAGE

01:14:27.663 --> 01:14:28.831
TO MAKE THAT CLEAR BECAUSE I

01:14:28.897 --> 01:14:30.632
THINK WE'RE ON THE SAME PAGE

01:14:30.699 --> 01:14:32.067
WITH SOME OF THE LOCL GUYS

01:14:32.134 --> 01:14:33.335
THAT. HAVE THOSE CONCERNS. OR

01:14:33.402 --> 01:14:34.570
WOULD YOU KNOW IF WE HAVE TO

01:14:34.636 --> 01:14:36.438
WILL JUST REMOVE IT BECAUSE WE

01:14:36.505 --> 01:14:37.706
REALLY WERE PUTTING IT IN THERE.

01:14:37.773 --> 01:14:39.541
AS A SAFEGUARD FOR THE LOCAL

01:14:39.608 --> 01:14:40.742
GOVERNMENTS NOT TRYING TO. PUT

01:14:40.809 --> 01:14:45.547
ANY NEW ONEROUS ON. THEM SO THAT

01:37:00.714 --> 01:37:02.516
MADE OF YEAH WE LOOKING FOR A

01:37:02.583 --> 01:37:04.919
PROBLEM HERE- AND THERE'S NOT

01:37:04.985 --> 01:37:06.387
REALLY A PROBLEM SO WE'RE

01:37:06.453 --> 01:37:08.322
LOOKING WHAT ARE WE LOOKING TO

01:37:08.389 --> 01:37:10.457
SOLVE WHAT IS REALLY AT STAKE

01:37:10.524 --> 01:37:12.326
HERE OR NOT I KNOW WHAT'S AT

01:37:12.393 --> 01:37:14.161
STAKE AS FAR AS THE PUBLIC RIGHT

01:37:14.228 --> 01:37:15.829
WE WANT THE PUBLIC TO BE ABLE TO

01:37:15.896 --> 01:37:17.631
HAVE ACCESS TO THESE DOCUMENTS

01:37:17.698 --> 01:37:19.533
SO. WHAT'S THE PROBLEM I YOU

01:37:19.600 --> 01:37:21.402
KNOW I THINK I AGREE WITH YOU

01:37:21.468 --> 01:37:22.570
IT'S PROBABLY A MINOR PROBLEM

01:37:22.636 --> 01:37:24.838
AND IT'S LIMITED- YOU KNOW

01:37:24.905 --> 01:37:26.473
TOWARD X. WHERE THEIR EXPOSURE

01:37:26.540 --> 01:37:27.942
IS ACROSS THE STATE ONE OF THE

01:37:28.008 --> 01:37:29.710
THINGS WHEN I FIRST GOT ALL OF

01:37:29.777 --> 01:37:32.179
MY BROTHER'S A HOME BUILDER MY

01:37:32.246 --> 01:37:32.780
DAD'S A HOME BUILDER WHEN I

01:37:32.846 --> 01:37:34.748
FIRST GOT ELECTED TO THE CITY

01:37:34.815 --> 01:37:36.684
COUNCIL IN TWO THOUSAND TWO AND-

01:37:36.750 --> 01:37:38.352
THIS WAS ALWAYS PECULIAR TO ME

01:37:38.419 --> 01:37:40.287
THAT. THESE PLANS WOULD COME IN

01:37:40.354 --> 01:37:41.855
ORDER THE CITY COUNCIL AND-

01:37:41.922 --> 01:37:44.792
EVERYTHING WAS THERE. YOU KNOW-

01:37:44.858 --> 01:37:46.193
THAT THE ARCHITECTS HAVE BEEN

01:37:46.260 --> 01:37:49.196
PAID TO DO AND- PUT ON PAPER AND

01:37:49.263 --> 01:37:51.131
AVAILABLE TO YOU KNOW. A DOWN TO

01:37:51.198 --> 01:37:54.401
THE VERY DETAIL- FOR THE

01:37:54.468 --> 01:37:56.537
PUBLIC'S REVIEW AND THEN. I

01:37:56.604 --> 01:37:59.406
ALWAYS KIND OF HAD THIS CONCEPT

01:37:59.473 --> 01:38:00.608
OF. IT THAT'S EXPOSED YOU KNOW

01:38:00.674 --> 01:38:01.642
FOR THEIR COMPETITION TO HAVE

01:38:01.709 --> 01:38:03.811
ACCESS TO IT SO I THOUGHT THAT

01:38:03.877 --> 01:38:05.479
WAS PECULIAR AND THEN. YOU KNOW.

01:38:05.546 --> 01:38:06.614
OBVIOUSLY DIDN'T THINK MUCH OF

01:38:06.680 --> 01:38:09.049
IT AFTER THAT BUT THIS CAME TO

01:38:09.116 --> 01:38:11.118
US THIS YEAR. I THINK THE- IT IS

01:38:11.185 --> 01:38:14.388
LIMITED THE EXPOSURE IS. LIMITED

01:38:14.455 --> 01:38:16.223
TO IF YOU KNOW IF YOU

01:38:16.290 --> 01:38:17.458
PROFESSIONALS IN THE STATE BUT-

01:38:17.524 --> 01:38:21.495
I THINK AS- AS POLICYMAKERS- WE

01:38:21.562 --> 01:38:23.931
WANT TO ALIGN. THE STATE POLICY

01:38:23.998 --> 01:38:26.233
WITH THE FEDERAL- POLICY TO

01:38:26.300 --> 01:38:28.202
PREVENT THESE LAWSUITS- THAT

01:38:28.269 --> 01:38:31.939
DOES EXTEND. IT JUST.GREAT A

01:38:32.006 --> 01:38:33.507
SITUATION WHERE WE'RE PUTTING

01:38:33.574 --> 01:38:35.242
THINGS INTO THE COURTS I THINK

01:38:35.309 --> 01:38:37.578
THAT CAN BE SOLVED HERE TODAY-

01:38:37.645 --> 01:38:40.014
IN ADDITION TO THAT IF MR BELOW

01:38:40.080 --> 01:38:41.015
HAS SOME ADDITIONAL COMMENTS

01:38:41.081 --> 01:38:44.451
SAID. LIKE FOR HIM TO ADD ON TO

01:38:44.518 --> 01:38:48.222
THAT THROUGH CHAIR VENTURE. YES

01:38:48.289 --> 01:38:50.157
OKAY THANK YOU I'M SORRY I THINK

01:38:50.224 --> 01:38:51.091
IT'S A VERY FAIR QUESTION

01:38:51.158 --> 01:38:53.761
SENATOR DORADO THE ASSOCIATION

01:38:53.827 --> 01:38:55.596
HAS PASSED FOR EXAMPLES WE'VE

01:38:55.663 --> 01:38:57.798
HAD PEOPLE FRANKLY KIND OF

01:38:57.865 --> 01:38:59.400
SHEEPISHLY ADMIT YES WE HAVE

01:38:59.466 --> 01:39:01.468
DONE THAT OURSELVES WHERE WHERE

01:39:01.535 --> 01:39:03.404
OF CONTRACTORS HAVING DONE IT

01:39:03.470 --> 01:39:04.972
IT'S KIND OF A SOMETHING THAT NO

01:39:05.039 --> 01:39:06.540
ONE WANTS TO TALK ABOUT AND YOU

01:39:06.607 --> 01:39:08.542
DON'T WANT TO NAME NAMES. BUT IF

01:39:08.609 --> 01:39:10.744
YOU TAKE THE ARCHITECT'S

01:39:10.811 --> 01:39:13.981
DRAWINGS FOR DESIGN REFERENCE

01:39:14.048 --> 01:39:14.815
AND THEY ADMIT THAT IT'S

01:39:14.882 --> 01:39:17.117
HAPPENING- THAT IS A COPYRIGHT

01:39:17.184 --> 01:39:18.886
VIOLATION AND IF THEY'RE JUST

01:39:18.952 --> 01:39:21.388
LEFT OUT IN THE OPEN PERMANENTLY

01:39:21.455 --> 01:39:23.123
THEN WE'RE FACILITATING THAT SO

01:39:23.190 --> 01:39:25.426
WE'D LIKE TO. YOU KNOW GET AHEAD

01:39:25.492 --> 01:39:28.062
OF IT. LAY OUT THE RULES

01:39:28.128 --> 01:39:28.662
CONSISTENT WITH THE BUILDING

01:39:28.729 --> 01:39:32.232
DEPARTMENT AND PREVENT LAWSUITS

01:39:32.299 --> 01:39:35.936
THAT. ANY OTHER QUESTION CENTER

01:39:36.003 --> 01:39:42.142
DRAWS A. YEAH I THOUGHT SO IT

01:39:42.209 --> 01:39:43.977
MAYBE IT IS RIGHT I DON'T SEE

01:39:44.044 --> 01:39:46.080
THAT THERE'S A PROBLEM OTHER

01:39:46.146 --> 01:39:47.981
THAN MAYBE SOMETIME IN THE

01:39:48.048 --> 01:39:51.418
FUTURE KIND OF SITUATION SO. WHY

01:39:51.485 --> 01:39:53.187
DO WE WANT TO TAKE THAT THE

01:39:53.253 --> 01:39:56.323
SIDES YOU KNOW WITH THE PUBLIC

01:39:56.390 --> 01:39:58.058
HAVING ACCESS WHEN IT HASN'T

01:39:58.125 --> 01:40:00.994
BEEN A PROBLEM I AND I THINK TO

01:40:01.061 --> 01:40:02.896
MR BALOCH POINT THERE HAVE BEEN

01:40:02.963 --> 01:40:06.667
SITUATIONS WHERE AT HAS ALREADY

01:40:06.734 --> 01:40:09.069
HAPPENED AND AGAIN. A SMALL AND

01:40:09.136 --> 01:40:10.537
VERY LIMITED- SO IT IS A SMALL

01:40:10.604 --> 01:40:12.639
PROBLEM IN A VERY LIMITED

01:40:12.706 --> 01:40:13.774
PROBLEM THAT WE'RE TRYING TO FIX

01:40:13.841 --> 01:40:16.610
HERE TODAY. YES SENATOR ALSO IF

01:40:16.677 --> 01:40:19.046
I COULD IF I COULD- I MEAN I HAD

01:40:19.113 --> 01:40:20.781
THE SAME ISSUE IT WHEN WE SAT

01:40:20.848 --> 01:40:21.849
DOWN HAD A CONVERSATION I THINK

01:40:21.915 --> 01:40:24.051
WHAT WAS. WHAT CONVINCED ME IS

01:40:24.118 --> 01:40:26.820
THAT- AND I SAT ON A PLANNING

01:40:26.887 --> 01:40:27.988
COMMISSION AND ALSO ON THE CITY

01:40:28.055 --> 01:40:30.391
COUNCIL. AND I WAS CONCERNED

01:40:30.457 --> 01:40:32.960
ABOUT THOSE BOARDS AND BODIES

01:40:33.026 --> 01:40:34.928
HAVING THE DOCUMENTS THEY NEED

01:40:34.995 --> 01:40:37.164
TO BE ABLE TO ANALYZE NEW

01:40:37.231 --> 01:40:38.699
PROJECTS IN THEIR IN THEIR

01:40:38.766 --> 01:40:40.067
COMMUNITY. AND THERE'S A

01:40:40.134 --> 01:40:41.802
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HAVING THE

01:40:41.869 --> 01:40:44.071
DETAILED. PLANNING DOCUMENTS

01:40:44.138 --> 01:40:45.606
THAT CONSTRUCTION DOCUMENTS IF

01:40:45.672 --> 01:40:50.177
YOU WILL- THAT TELL YOU- DOWN TO

01:40:50.244 --> 01:40:53.847
THE TO THE- TO THE INCH LEVEL

01:40:53.914 --> 01:40:55.916
WHAT WHAT SHE NEEDS TO GO WHERE

01:40:55.983 --> 01:40:59.920
RIGHT- IT THERE IS THERE'S A

01:40:59.987 --> 01:41:00.988
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THAT AND SITE

01:41:01.054 --> 01:41:02.890
PLANS AND MASSING DOT DIAGRAMS

01:41:02.956 --> 01:41:04.691
MASSING DIAGRAMS TO SHOW YOU HOW

01:41:04.758 --> 01:41:06.794
BIG THE BUILDING IS AND WHAT IT%

01:41:06.860 --> 01:41:08.362
LOOKS LIKE. AND THAT THE SITE

01:41:08.429 --> 01:41:09.763
PLANS TELL YOU THE SET BACKS AND

01:41:09.830 --> 01:41:11.565
ALL THAT KINDA STUFF IN OTHER

01:41:11.632 --> 01:41:13.000
WORDS YOU DON'T NEED THE LEVEL

01:41:13.066 --> 01:41:15.035
OF DETAIL THAT THE- BUILDING

01:41:15.102 --> 01:41:17.971

INNOVATIVE WAYS OF. DOING THINGS

01:50:52.178 --> 01:50:54.347
ONLINE IS IT CREATES THESE

01:50:54.414 --> 01:50:56.783
ISSUES. AND THEY WERE SORT OF

01:50:56.850 --> 01:50:57.817
STUCK TRYING TO FIGURE IT OUT

01:50:57.884 --> 01:51:01.121
AND SORTED OUT- SO THAT'S JUST

01:51:01.187 --> 01:51:02.322
THE FIRST THING THAT ALWAYS HITS

01:51:02.389 --> 01:51:05.225
ME AS- IT MOVES FORWARD. EXPEDIA

01:51:05.291 --> 01:51:08.161
OTHER COMPANIES I USE- WHATEVER

01:51:08.228 --> 01:51:10.296
WE'LL USE THEM BUT- IT CREATES

01:51:10.363 --> 01:51:11.831
SOME PROBLEMS HERE AND THEN WE

01:51:11.898 --> 01:51:13.900
HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO. MAKE

01:51:13.967 --> 01:51:18.238
SURE IT DOESN'T CAUSE- ISSUES OF

01:51:18.304 --> 01:51:20.540
I UNDERSTAND WITH REGARDS TO THE

01:51:20.607 --> 01:51:23.410
STATE THAT THE COLLECTION OF

01:51:23.476 --> 01:51:26.980
TAXES WILL NOT BE. BUT IMPACTED.

01:51:27.047 --> 01:51:28.748
OKAY IF ANYTHING PLAYING THAT

01:51:28.815 --> 01:51:30.483
SURE IF ANYTHING I THINK IT WILL

01:51:30.550 --> 01:51:32.952
BE MORE ACCURATE BECAUSE

01:51:33.019 --> 01:51:34.754
SOMETIMES WHEN THERE'S CHANGES.

01:51:34.821 --> 01:51:36.623
THE PLATFORMS ARE NOT AWARE OF

01:51:36.689 --> 01:51:38.958
THESE CHANGES SO THEY CAN'T AND

01:51:39.025 --> 01:51:40.493
EVERY STATE BEING DIFFERENT WITH

01:51:40.560 --> 01:51:42.128
THE CHANGES FROM THE CONSUMER

01:51:42.195 --> 01:51:43.797
MIGHT CREATE SOME DISCREPANCIES

01:51:43.863 --> 01:51:45.265
AND WHAT IS COLLECTED WHAT IS

01:51:45.331 --> 01:51:46.166
NOT WHEN YOU HAVE SOMEBODY

01:51:46.232 --> 01:51:48.802
DIRECTLY. IN STATE THAT KNOWS

01:51:48.868 --> 01:51:51.771
WHAT THE CURRENT AMOUNTS ARE IN

01:51:51.838 --> 01:51:53.540
THE KNOW WHAT THE CHANGES ARE TO

01:51:53.606 --> 01:51:55.308
THE LOCAL BOOKINGS THEN THEY CAN

01:51:55.375 --> 01:51:56.843
HAVE A MORE ACCURATE COLLECTION

01:51:56.910 --> 01:51:59.479
OF THE TAXES AND IN THIS CASE SO

01:51:59.546 --> 01:52:00.547
I THINK IF ANYTHING IT ALLOWS

01:52:00.613 --> 01:52:01.915
FOR MORE TRANSPARENCY MORE

01:52:01.981 --> 01:52:04.117

ARE NECESSARY- I DIDN'T SEE I

01:52:12.659 --> 01:52:15.862

01:52:15.929 --> 01:52:18.164

02:07:14.526 --> 02:07:15.928
NOTION THAT THERE ARE TEN

02:07:15.995 --> 02:07:17.129
THOUSAND LINE HITS WHEN AGAIN

02:07:17.196 --> 02:07:19.064

WE THINK THE RISK IS VERY LOW

02:07:37.783 --> 02:07:39.284
THE COST IS RELATIVELY HIGH. THE

02:07:39.351 --> 02:07:40.986

AND OUR LINES TO THAT ACTUALLY

02:11:16.301 --> 02:11:17.703
COULD CREATE A BIGGER PROBLEM

02:11:17.769 --> 02:11:19.404
THAT AFFECTS OUR WATER. AND NOT

02:11:19.471 --> 02:11:20.973
ONLY THAT BUT IT ALSO COULD IT

02:11:21.039 --> 02:11:23.108

WHEN IT COMES TO DOING OUR JOB

02:13:19.624 --> 02:13:21.426
