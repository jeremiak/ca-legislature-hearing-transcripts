DR GRANT GOOD MORNING CHAIRPERSON AND ASSEMBLY MEMBERS. THE IMPLICATION WAS FOR THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH CDP H. TO SHARE ARE EXPERIENCED IN THE CONTEXT.

THE INFORMATION COLLECTED HAS BEEN AGGREGATED TO PROTECT THE PRIVACY OF THE INDIVIDUALS WHO PARTICIPATED. THE NEXT REPORT AND SUBSEQUENT ANNUAL REPORTS ONE POMPOUS A FULL TWELVE MONTHS OF DATA. FOR THE PARTIAL YEAR ENDING DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN. ONE HUNDRED NINETY ONE INDIVIDUALS RECEIVE PRESCRIPTIONS UNDER EO WELL A. ONE HUNDRED ELEVEN INDIVIDUALS DIED FOLLOWING THEIR INGESTION OF THE PRESCRIBED AID IN DYING MEDICATIONS.

PRETEND THOUSAND TOTAL DOUBTS BASED ON ONE HER EIGHTY THREE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE TO US IN CALIFORNIA. FROM JUNE NINTH TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN TO DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN. SOME QUESTIONS HAVE EMERGED FOR CURRENTLY SINCE PUBLICATION THE FIRST REPORT. AND MAY BE INFORMATIVE WE NOW TURN TO THOSE QUESTIONS. AND RESPONSES. HOW WOULD INDIVIDUALS WHO GOT PRESCRIPTIONS IN ONE YEAR? BUT DID NOT AVAIL THEMSELVES OF THE PRESCRIPTIONS AND THAT YEAR. BE COUNTED. THE EEL LA AND REPORT INCLUDES DATA FROM FORM SUBMITTED TO CDP H.. IN THE CALENDAR YEAR. A QUALIFY PATIENTS FOR WHOM A PATIENT'S REQUEST FOR AID IN DYING DRUG FORMS WAS SUBMITTED IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN. WILL BE COUNTED AMONG PATIENTS FOR WHOM THAT FORM WAS SUBMITTED. AND TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN. IF CD PICTURES NOT RECEIVE EITHER THE ATTENDING PHYSICIANS FOLLOW UP FORM. OR A CALIFORNIA DEATH CERTIFICATE. FOR THE PATIENT FOR THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN REPORT. THAT PATIENT'S OUTCOME WILL BE COUNTED AS UNDETERMINED. AS SHE BE PH RECEIVES THE ATTENDING POSITION SPOT FORM HURRY CALIFORNIA DEATH CERTIFICATE. IN SUBSEQUENT YEARS. THE PATIENTS THAT. WILL BE REPORTED. AND THAT HERE'S REPORT. WHAT DOES THE TERM? QUOTE UNDETERMINED OUTCOMES AND QUOTE MEAN A FIGURE ONE OF THE REPORT. THE TERM UNDETERMINED OUTCOMES DESCRIBES INDIVIDUALS WHO RECEIVED A PRESCRIPTION FOR AID IN DYING DRUGS. AND SEE THE PAGE HAS RECEIVED THE ATTENDING PHYSICIANS TRACKLISTING APPLIANCE FORM. BUT NOT BE ATTENDING PHYSICIANS FOLLOWED FORM. AND ARE A CALIFORNIA DEATH CERTIFICATE. WERE THE SOURCES THE CD PH USED TO COME TO THESE NUMBERS. THE DATA'S DERIVED FROM THE INFORMATION PROVIDED BY THE ATTENDING PHYSICIANS TRACKLISTING APPLIANCE FORM. CONSULTING POSITIONS COMPLIANCE FORM. ATTENDING PHYSICIANS FOLLOW UP FORM. AND CALIFORNIA DEATH CERTIFICATES SUBMITTED TO CDP H. PURSUANT TO THE LAW. WHY IS THE CAUSE OF DEATH FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS ON THEIR DEATH CERTIFICATES LISTED ASSETS? UNDERLYING TERMINAL ILLNESS. RATHER THAN. AID IN DYING PRESCRIPTION. REPORTING THE UNDERLYING TERMINAL DISEASE AS THE UNDERLYING CAUSE OF DEATH ON DEATH CERTIFICATES. EFFECTUATE THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE'S INTENT. REGARDING THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF PATIENT'S PARTICIPATION IN THE ACT. COMPLIES WITH APPLICABLE LAW. AND BEST INSURERS THE RELIABILITY AND USEFULNESS OF DATA. COLLECTED FROM THE DEATH CERTIFICATE FOR STATE. NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL SURVEILLANCE PURPOSES. WHEN WILL NEW DATA BE AVAILABLE. DATA FROM JANUARY FIRST TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THIRTY SUMMER THIRTY FIRST TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. WILL BE PUBLISHED IN THE NEXT ANNUAL REPORT. AROUND. JUNE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. THIS REPORT WILL HAVE A FULL TWELVE MONTHS OF DATA. WHAT TO SEE PHD WITH ALL THE OTHER DATA? THERE IS REPORTED ON THE FORMS. THE FORMS USED TO COLLECT DATA FOR THE END OF LIFE ACT ARE DETAILED IN THE ACT. S. WELL THE SPECIFIC REPORTING REQUIREMENTS ARE DELINEATED IN THE ACT. AND SECTION FOUR FOUR THREE POINT ONE NINE. THE FORMS WILL BE KEPT SECURELY STORED FOR THREE YEARS FOR FOLLOW SURVEILLANCE AND THEM RECOMMENDATION OF LEGAL COUNSEL. THE DAD IS RETAINED IN A SECURE DATABASE. ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS. WHAT DID YOU THINK YOU'RE NOT CAPTURING? I THINK DATA ON. THE NUMBER PURCHASE THE NUMBER OF POSITIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. POR PARTICIPATING IN THE ACT AND MAY BE AVAILABLE TO PATIENTS. WHO WISH TO PARTICIPATE? IN THE ACT. IN TERMS OF REPORT ABILITY WE OF COURSE HAVE DATA ON THE POSITIONS. WHO PARTICIPATE BUT THAT IS NOT CURRENTLY A REPORTABLE ITEM? IT IN ARE YOU FINDING THAT WHEN YOU RECEIVE THE FORMS EVERYTHING IS FILLED OUT. TO BE ABLE TO USE ALL THE DATA. WE WERE INSTRUCTED. THAT OUR ROLE IS NOT S. ENFORCEMENT. THAT WE ACCEPT THE FORMS AS THEIR SUBMITTED. I WILL NOTE THAT ANECDOTALLY. HAS COME TO ME THAT ALL FORMS ARE NOT PERFECTLY COMPLIANT AS ONE MIGHT EXPECT IN A HUMAN WORLD. HOWEVER WE HAVE NURSES JUST FIX THAT WE'VE BEEN ENJOYING TOGETHER. ON THE DATA QUALITY IN THAT REGARD. THANK YOU. QUESTIONS MAN MEMBERS. A THANK YOU MUCH AND I A I WOULD LIKE TO NOTE THAT WE HAVE BEEN JOINED A IN ADDITION TO SENATOR WILK. DID THE OTHER PARTNER ON THIS WAS SENATOR BILL MONNING WHO GETS TO SIT UP HERE WITH US BECAUSE HE'S STILL IN OFFICE BOYD'S ALSO WANNA GIVE HIM A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF THANKS AND ALL OF. A BIGGER CHAMPION FOR THIS BILL AND THERE WAS NOT SO WE WANNA ACKNOWLEDGE YOU AND AND OFF OUR FEET UP TO TO MAKE SOME COMMENTS IF YOU'D LIKE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR IT'S WANT TO THANK YOU IN THE SELECT COMMITTEE FOR CONVENING THIS. ALL WHO ARE PARTICIPATING NOT JUST TODAY. BUT WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS IMPORTANT. HUMAN RIGHT IN CALIFORNIA SO THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP AND IT'S. GOOD TO SEE. OUR OTHER. COLLABORATOR SENATOR LOIS WOKE WELCOME BACK. A AND WE'VE ALSO BEEN DUG JOINED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER JACQUI IRWIN WHO WAS ALSO. INSTRUMENTAL ON THE PASSAGE OF THIS BILL. OKAY WELL IF THERE ARE NO OTHER QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME. I THINK YOU. AND NEXT UP WILL HAVE THE. PROVIDER EXPERIENCE. WE HAVE DONE A DOCTOR KATHERINE FORREST FROM STANFORD AND DR LYNETTE CEDAR QUEST FROM UC SAN DIEGO. WELCOME MANAGE EVERYTHING YOU SO MUCH FOR CONVENING THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE OUR EXPERIENCES. IN THIS AFTER THE FIRST ARM YEAR PLUS OF IMPLEMENTATION. I'M HERE PARTLY IN HONOR OF MY MOTHER. WHO WAS THAT WOMAN OF THE YEAR FOR MY COUNTY I GREW UP IN SANTA BARBARA COUNTY IN THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND AND TWO WOULD HAVE USED THIS OPTION HAD BEEN? AVAILABLE TO HER ALONG WITH OUR HONORABLE JUDGE JOE LIGE R. WHO ALSO WOULD HAVE USED IT HAD BEEN AVAILABLE ON HIS WIDOW ASKS ME TO SPEAK ON BEHALF. AND IT IS IN THAT SPIRIT THAT I CAME FORWARD VERY PUBLICLY VERY EARLY ON. I'M I ALSO JUST WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WHILE I'VE WORKED AT STANFORD I LIVE IN SANTA CRUZ COUNTY AND VERY GRATEFUL FOR THOSE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE HERE TODAY I HAVE ALSO CHAMPION THIS PAL. I'M BEEN AND IF A FAMILY PHYSICIAN BOARD CERTIFIED FOR MY FOURTH TIME I PRACTICE. FROM BIRTH TO DEATH ARE IN MANY DIFFERENT SETTINGS INCLUDING THE COMMUNITY CLINICS THE SAFETY NET CLINICS PRIVATE PRACTICE AND FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS IN ACADEMIA TO TRY AND. THAT CAN PEOPLE INTO THE PRIMARY CARE FEELS. THIS PARTICULAR TOPIC IS VERY RELEVANT TO THOSE OF US THE PRACTICE IN PRIMARY CARE BECAUSE MOST OR MANY END OF LIFE ISSUES ARE IN THE HANDS OF THOSE OF US THAT LIVE. AND WORK IN OUR COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE. WHEN I FIRST WHEN THE BILL WAS FIRST OUT BEING PASSED BY RECOGNIZED AT THAT ONE OF THE CRITICAL ISSUES CHORUS GONNA BE MENTOR SHIP THAT WHEN WE MOVE. FROM SOMETHING THAT IS ABSTRACTED OR IN ANOTHER STATE TO DO BEING VERY PRACTICALLY IMPLEMENTABLE IN OUR OWN. TIME STATE THAT WE NEEDED TO DO THINGS TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE. ARE THAT OUR PATIENTS RECEIVED THE ABSOLUTE BEST CARE POSSIBLE A AT THE END OF LIFE INCLUDING THE OPTION OF MEDICAL AID IN DYING. AND SO I'VE BEEN SPENDING MY TIME IN THIS LAST. I REALLY TWO YEARS NOW BEING INVOLVED IN TRAINING SO AN EVENT AS I PRESCRIBED MYSELF REALIZING WHAT AM I MISSING HOW DO I NEED TO BE ABLE TO HOLD THIS INFORMATION AND. AND DELIVER THIS INFORMATION TO PEOPLE WHO NEED IT. WHAT WE'VE DONE THROUGH A CALIFORNIA COUNTY OF FAMILY PHYSICIANS MULTIPLE? WEBINARS ON IN PERSON CONTINUING MEDICAL EDUCATION TRAININGS. I'VE PARTICIPATED DIDN'T PATIENT AND THE PATIENT'S SIDE ON COMMUNITY TV COMMUNITY RADIO ON IN THE TOWN HALLS THAT WERE DONE EARLY ON WITH SENATOR MONEY. AND NOW WHAT WE'RE FINDING IS THAT ONE OF THE LARGEST THE SECOND LARGEST ISSUES IS ACCESS TO CARE. SO WHILE PEOPLE WHO BY NATURE OR BY OR BY. SCIENCE OR BY SPIRIT DECIDED TO COME FORWARD EARLY. TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO BEST MENTOR OTHERS IN THE COMMUNITY TO PROVIDE THAT EXCELLENT CARE AND BY EXCELLENT I MEAN SPECIFICALLY WHAT MEDICATIONS WHAT DOSES WHAT DO YOU SAY ON THAT HOW CAN YOU HOLD SPACE FOR SOMEONE. TO LIVE THE LIFE THEY WANT IN THE TIME THAT THEY HAVE. AND ALSO TO HOLD SPACE FOR THEIR CONCERNS AND MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN ADDRESS THE. I CAN TELL YOU RIGHT RIGHT NOW I HAVE THREE PEOPLE IN THE LAST MONTH THAT I'VE HAD CONSULTATIONS AS AN ATTENDING PHYSICIAN. ARE AN ALMOST TWENTY YEAR OLD WITH METASTATIC CANCER I HAVE A FORTY SIX YEAR OLD SINGLE MOTHER WHO'S BEEN FIGHTING AND FIGHTING AND FIGHTING AND. CAME TO ME TO EXPLORE MEDICAL AID IN DYING AND I'VE A SEVENTY SEVEN YEAR OLD WHO CAN'T SPEAK ANYMORE AFTER ALL THE SURGERIES THROUGH HIS THE UPPER PART OF HIS BODY. AND WE COMMUNITY COMMITTEE COMPLETELY. AND WRITING. AND I JUST WANTED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I TO HAVE NO CLUE WHETHER NOT THESE PEOPLE WILL CONTINUE BUT JUST KNOWING THAT THE OPTION IS THERE AND THAT THERE'S SOMEONE ON THE OTHER END WITH SKILLS. HAS AYE I CAN'T EVEN DESCRIBE THE IMPORTANCE OF THAT EXPERIENCE FOR THE FOR THE HUMANS ON AND THEIR FAMILIES THAT WE CARE FOR IN OUR OFFICE. THREE OF THOSE OF THE THREE OF THOSE TO WERE DENIED. BY THEIR CURRENT PHYSICIANS FOR THE MOST RECENT PISSED BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE UNCOMFORTABLE AND HESITANT NOT BECAUSE THEY'RE OPPOSED SO IT'S THAT ALONG WITH THE ACCESS ISSUE HESITANCY IS THE SECOND BIGGEST ISSUE THAT I SEE AN IMPLEMENTATION. ARE AND FOR THAT REASON I'M CONTINUING MY OUT REACH TO DO TRAININGS AT THE CALIFORNIA ACADEMY OF FAMILY PHYSICIANS. CLINICAL FOREMAN MONTEREY THIS YEAR FOR THE FIRST TIME AND MONEY. ASSEMBLY LIKE THAT. I WOULD LIKE TO SESSIONS ARE OPEN TO IT UP VERY OPEN. VERY OPEN BUT IT'S NEW AND FOR THAT REASON BEING ABLE TO. FIND OUT WHO ELSE IS PRESCRIBING WHAT DO THEY PRESCRIBE WHAT DO YOU DO IF SOMETHING. IS LESS IT ISN'T EXPECTED ETCETERA SO THOSE ARE THE TWO BIG THINGS THAT I SEE IS AS AS OUR ISSUES RIGHT NOW. ACCESS FINDING SOMEONE WHO WILL PRESCRIBE CAN PRESCRIBE THAT HAS THE ABILITY TO FIND RESOURCES TO HELP THEM DO SO BRILLIANTLY AND. COMPASSIONATELY AND THEN. THE SECOND IS ACTUALLY THAT VENUE WHO WHO ARE THOSE PEOPLE HOW HOW DID WE DO THAT ACCESS AND INFORMATION. QUESTION. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND. DOCTOR FOR BEING HERE TODAY BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY HERE. CONTRIBUTIONS TO THIS IMPORTANT NATIONAL CONVERSATION. AND THEN REALLY TAKING UP THE FRONT LINES SEEN BOTH EDUCATION. AND PRACTICE IN DIRECT PATIENT CARE. I WOULD LIKE TESTS FOLLOW UP ON THE ACCESS ISSUE. MY GUESS IS. PEOPLE WHO KNOW OF YOUR WORK DIRECT A LOT OF PROSPECTIVE PATIENTS YOUR DIRECTION. BUT. WHAT IF THAT'S A PATIENT IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY IMPERIAL COUNTY? DO YOU HAVE ANY RESOURCES ARE AT YOUR FINGERTIPS TO KNOW WHAT OTHER PHYSICIANS AND OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE. MAY BE. A PROVIDING SUPPORT YOU ASKED A GREAT QUESTION AND THE SHORT ANSWER IS THAT THERE'S NOTHING FORMAL NOW IT'S ALL BY INFORMAL NETWORKS. WHICH MEANS THAT PEOPLE WHO HAVE GOOD SKILLS FOR ACCESSING NETWORKS ENGLISH LANGUAGE FOR INSTANCE ARM HAVE GOOD ACCESS AND THOSE THAT DON'T MIGHT NOT. IT THERE IS ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS IS THAT BECAUSE OF THAT STATE FUNDING VERSUS THE FEDERAL FUNDING ISSUE PEOPLE THAT ARE IN FEDERALLY FUNDED CENTERS ARE. HAVING TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT HOW TO PROCEED AND IT'S NOT IN NOT DIFFERENT OTHER THINGS WHERE THERE'S FEDERAL BANDS. BUT IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE IT IT'S CHALLENGING AND I KNOW OF I'VE GOT TO SPEAK TO NOW FOR DIFFERENT COUNTIES ARE HEALTH SYSTEMS ABOUT WHAT THEY MIGHT DO HOPE THEY CAN NAVIGATE THAT BUT IT IS AN ISSUE. WHICH IS IF YOU DON'T HAVE MEANS IF YOU DON'T HAVE LANGUAGE HOW CAN YOU ACCESS. IN THE END EQUITABLE WAY PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS WORRIED THE OTHER WAY ABOUT. VULNERABLE POPULATIONS I ACTUALLY THINK. THE WAY THAT WE'VE RULED OUT WITH WITH THUMB WITHOUT THE SUPPORT FOR THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY AND WITH THIS. GIVE THEM AROUND FUNDING. THAT WE PERHAPS ARE SERVING THAT PRIVILEGED IN OUR STATE BETTER NOW THAN THEN AT A MORE EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION WON'T THANK YOU FOR THAT I THINK. BECAUSE IT IS IN ITS EARLY STAGES OF IMPLEMENTATION. THE THINGS WE LEARN NOW CAN HELP US. MOVE FORWARD IN MAYBE NOT NECESSARILY LEGISLATIVELY BUT MAYBE THROUGH EXISTING NETWORKS OF POSITION ASSOCIATIONS. PROVIDER CESSATIONS PHARMACEUTICAL ASSOCIATIONS ARM. WORKING WITH EACH OTHER TO PROVIDE THE KIND OF THE INFORMAL INFORMATION SHARING. BUT INFORMALITY ONLY GET YOU SO FAR AND AS YOU POINT OUT CERTAIN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES SHOULD HAVE SIMILAR ACCESS. NUMBER THE OTHER ISSUE I KNOW AND YOU DIDN'T DWELL ON IT THIS MORNING BUT I'VE HEARD YOU AT OTHER FORUMS. MAKE VERY CLEAR THAT THE CONTINUUM OF END OF LIFE CARE. AID IN DYING IS ONE OPTION. AMONG MANY AND THAT OF THE BROADER MEDICAL GOAL. IS MAKING SURE PATIENTS. HAVE ACCESS TO OWN A HOME FORMS OF CARE. PAIN MANAGEMENT PALETTE IF CARE. HOSPICE CARE AND AID IN DYING IF THAT PROVES TO BE THE APPROPRIATE. MEASURES SANTA ACCURATE STATEMENT ABSOLUTELY I MEAN THE DATA AT THE HOLDS OUT THAT. IN THE CONTEXT OF SPEAKING OF ALL OF COVERAGE OF THE OPTIONS AT THE END OF LIFE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE LEGISLATION HAS ALLOWED US TO DO IS TO SAY YES THIS IS AVAILABLE AND THEN HERE ARE ALL OF THE THINGS THAT WE CAN DO. AND WE FIND THAT IN THAT IT THAT IT DOES MAKE IT HELPS ON THE FRONT LINES FOR PEOPLE TO BE MORE FUN ARTICULATE ABOUT WHAT THE OPTIONS ARE IN FOR PATIENTS TO DESCRIBE THEIR CONCERNS. THE DATA OF HOW MANY ARE IN HOSPICE CARE RELATIVE TO THOSE THAT ARE IN HOSPICE CARE ACROSS THE STATE JUST FOR TERMINAL ILLNESS IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS IS. IS EVIDENCE ENOUGH OF THAT THAT ALLOWS US TO SPEAK ABOUT PALLIATIVE MEDICINE OF HOSPICE CARE. ETCETERA IN A MORE IN A MORE MUCH MORE ACCESSIBLE WAY IT CERTAINLY IS MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE I HAD SOMEONE IN IN NAM NOVEMBER WHO CAME FORWARD. FEELING QUITE DESPERATE ACTUALLY UNABLE TO ACCESS CARE CAME INTOMY OFFICE AND NO BECAUSE. THEY HAD GONE INTO OFFICE TO ASK ABOUT END OF LIFE CARE THE CURTAIN CAME DOWN AND THEY COULDN'T HAVE THIS MORE ROBUST CONVERSATION ABOUT. WHAT DO YOU HOW CAN WE BEST SUPPORT YOU AND YOUR FAMILY AT THIS PART OF YOUR LIFE THEY FOUND HOSPICE IT WAS ABSOLUTELY PERFECT ABSOLUTELY RIGHT IN THE HEAD EXACTLY? THAT AND MONTHS THAT THEY HOPED SO I I I I I THINK IT'S. REALLY BIRTH HARPING ON ACTUALLY THAT IT'S JUST ONE OPTION AND IT'S VASTLY APPROPRIATE FOR SOME AND NOT OTHERS I SOMETIMES LIKEN IT TO BIRTH WHERE PEOPLE ARE VERY JUDGMENTAL ABOUT WHAT A GOOD BIRTH IS WHETHER OR NOT YOU SHOULD HAVE AN EPIDURAL WHETHER OR NOT YOU SHOULD. BE IN A HOSPITAL OR ALL OF THE DIFFERENT WAYS THAT PEOPLE ARE HAVE JUDGMENT ABOUT IT BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY. WE DON'T CHANGE PEOPLE IN THIS CRITICAL NINE MONTH PERIOD JUST LIKE IN THE END OF LIFE WE DON'T. CHANGE IT FOR PEOPLE PLAN YOU KNOW THINKING ABOUT THAT THEIR OWN THEIR OWN AND FOR LIFE. AND THAT WITHOUT JUDGMENT AND JUST TALKING ABOUT OPTIONS PEOPLE FEEL EMPOWERED. CALMER UNSAFE FOR AND THEY'RE GOOD CONVERSATION THINKING THEN MADAM CHAIR OF A FINAL QUESTION IF I MIGHT. IN THEM IN ADVANCE I'M HAVE TO LEAVE TO CAST A VOTE IN A. COMEDIAN I WILL BE BACK BUT MY. THE FINAL QUESTION THIS POINT. IN TERMS OF THE TRAINING ON MEDICAL SCHOOL CURRICULUM. MEDICAL ASSOCIATIONS CONTINUING EDUCATION HAVE YOU SEEN ANY INCORPORATION. OF TRAINING ON. A AID IN DYING IN. IN THESE FACETS OF A CONTINUING EDUCATION FOR PHYSICIANS OR MEDICAL STUDENTS AND TRAINING. THIS IS. AT AREA THAT'S RIGHT FOR DEVELOPMENT SO FOR INSTANCE AT THE RESIDENTS SEE THAT. OR THE MEDICAL SCHOOL WHERE I AM THERE IS NO FORMAL TRAINING AT ALL CURRENTLY WE KEEP TALKING ABOUT IT WHEN PEOPLE COME TO MY OFFICE INDIVIDUALLY OFFER CLINICAL ROTATIONS THEY WILL BUT THERE'S NOT. NOTHING INTEGRATED INTO THE MEDICAL SCHOOL CURRICULUM A SAME THING FOR THE RESIDENCY SO I'VE GONE AND SPOKEN TO THE RESIDENTS IN SEVERAL FAMILY MEDICINE RESIDENCIES BUT THERE'S NOT NO FORMAL CURRICULUM. YET BUT I IMAGINE WE ARE AND WILL BE WORKING ON THAT TIP TO IN ORDER FOR PEOPLE TO HAVE. MORE CAPACITY. MR DON'T. THANK YOU THEY CONDUCT FOR SIZING AFFAIRS AND VERY NICE TO SEE YOU HERE TODAY AND I APPRECIATE. THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING TO EDUCATE AND JUST FROM A COMMENT I THINK THIS CD PH REPORT SHOWS. THAT YOU ARE CORRECT ABOUT WHO THIS IS REALLY REACHING. AND IN OUR AREA COUPLE DIFFERENT PHYSICIAN GROUPS OR HANDLING IT DIFFERENTLY AND ONE. WHO EMBRACE DEAD WHEN THINGS I THINK THAT WAS REALLY HELPFUL FOR PHYSICIANS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT MEDICAL GROUP WORD THAT THE FORMS THE POLICIES PROCEDURES THAT THEY PUT IN PLACE? BECAUSE THEY WERE LEADING PHYSICIANS KNOW AND AS I UNDERSTAND IT NOT ALL PHYSICIANS IN THAT MEDICAL GROUP ARE WILLING TO BE ATTENDING PHYSICIANS OR SOMETHING PATIENTS BUT. BUT STILL THERE IS A PROCESS BUILT INTO THAT ORGANIZATION. WHICH LEADS LENDS SOME COMFORT OR SOME. BACKING TO A PHYSICIAN WHO IS INTERESTED IN HAVING A CONVERSATION ABOUT IT MOTHER PHYSICIANS GROUPS. NOT SO INTERESTED IN NOT SENDING A SIMILAR MESSAGE DOWN TO THERE. THE TO THEIR PHYSICIANS AND SO FOR THOSE NOT ASSOCIATED WITH PHYSICIANS GROUPS FOR THOSE WHO ARE DEALING WITH UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. FINDING WAYS TO GET PROCESSES PROCEDURES EDUCATION OUTTA ABOUT WHAT THIS REALLY REPRESENTS WHAT THE OPTIONS ARE WHO THE PHYSICIANS ARE WHO ARE KNOWLEDGEABLE ENOUGH ABOUT EIGHT. WILLING TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS IS IS GOING TO BE IMPORTANT. THIS WILL BE A LONG TERM PROCESS GETTING EVERYBODY UP TO SPEED AND AND TRULY UNDERSTANDING WHAT THIS OPTION. REPRESENTS. BUT THE. FINDING WAYS TO TO INTEGRATED TO THE MEDICAL SCHOOLS AS SENATOR POINTS OUT WORK IN THAT THE PHYSICIANS GROUPS AND EVEN JUST HAVING FORMS OR SOMEPLACE TO GO. WHAT POSITION IS ASKED ABOUT IT? SO THAT THEY CAN GET THEIR QUESTIONS ANSWERED IS ULTIMATELY REALLY VERY IMPORTANCE OF BECOMES A NORMAL PART. OF THAT INTERACTION BETWEEN TO PAY SAID IN A POSITION. IF THE PATIENT NEVER AVAIL THEMSELVES OF THAT THEY AT LEAST HAVE THE SOUP VERY APPROPRIATELY POINT OUT THE COMFORT OF BEING ABLE TO HOUSE. AND SEE WHAT OPTIONS THERE ARE. SO THAT THEY FEEL THAT THEY HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE CONTROL OVER A VERY SIGNIFICANT PART OF THEIR LIFE THAT'S THE PROCESS OF. OF DYING IN AND. HOW THEY GET TO DO THAT WITH DIGNITY AND? AND ALONG WITH THE HELP OF THEIR PHYSICIAN TO APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE WHAT YOU'RE DOING AND IF WE CAN FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET. MORE ASSOCIATIONS PHYSICIANS GROUPS AND OTHERS INTERESTED AND AT LEAST. HAVING THOSE OPTIONS AND THAT EDUCATION AVAILABLE THAT I THINK WE TAKE A LOT OF THE STIGMA AND FEAR. OUT OF WHAT THIS OPTION REPRESENTS. THANK YOU. CAN I RESPOND BRIEFLY I AGREE ONE HUNDRED PERCENT AND I'M NOTICING IN MY OWN TRAINING THAT INITIALLY PEOPLE WANTED TO KNOW WHAT THE LAW WAS. AND NOW PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW HOW. WHAT TO DO HOWL TO ENACT THE LAW HOW TO HAVE THE CONGRESS WATER CREEK HAVE A CRUCIAL CONVERSATION WORDS THAT WORK MEDICATIONS WHAT HAPPENS IF THERE'S COMPLEMENT? OUT COMPLICATIONS SO WE'VE ACTUALLY GROWN AND DEVELOPED AND THAT'S ANOTHER AREA SO THERE'S THE VERY FRONT LINE OF WHAT IS THIS ANYWAY AND THEN THERE'S THE SECONDARY WHICH IS HOW IS THIS ANYWAY. THAT THANK YOU FOR THAT COMMENT. IT'S BEEN MY EXPERIENCE TO IT IN IN A SPOKE WITH A COUPLE WHEN WHEN SYSTEMS ACTUALLY ARE INTENTIONAL ABOUT DEVELOPING PROTOCOLS AND. TRAINING FOR PHYSICIANS I THINK IT'S JUST A BIT. WHO DID MUCH BETTER? I WANT TO ASK IN A NO GOOD MISTER LEVINE. WHAT ABOUT THE ROLE OF INTERDISCIPLINARY TEAMS I KNOW SOMETIMES IT'S A CARGO FOR THE POSITION INITIALLY TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS BUT HOW ARE YOU SEEING? THE THE BUT THE INTERFACE BETWEEN INTERDISCIPLINARY TEAMS IN BEING IN LOVE IMPLEMENT FACILITATORS YEAH I I THINK THAT IT'S CRUCIAL AND THAT'S WHERE WE'RE HEADED IN THE MEDICINE IN GENERAL WHICH IS A TO HAVE PATIENT. OUGHT PATIENT ORIENTED TEAM BASED CARE. IN OUR PARTICULAR INSTITUTION I WORKED VERY CLOSELY WITH THE SOCIAL WORKER OF WHO'S EMBEDDED IN MY OFFICE. AND. WE'VE I'VE HAD CONVERSATIONS MIGHT BY A MEDICAL ASSISTANT AND MY OF THE NURSE WHO IS IN OUR OFFICE ALSO PARTICIPATES WE ALSO REFER FOR CONSCRIPTS ATTENTION TO PALLIATIVE CARE WHICH IS A SHORTAGE IN OUR COMMUNITY AND I REALIZE THE LUXURY OF THAT IT'S ACTUALLY BUILT INTO STANFORD'S PROCESS. BUT IT OFFER OFF SO OFFERS THAT CAPACITY OF ALSO PATIENT ADVOCACY WE'VE SEEN VERY EFFECTIVE IN THE GROUP HEALTH MODELS KAISER MODEL I KNOW OTHER PEOPLE BE SPEAKING TO THAT. BUT I AGREE WITH YOU A HUNDRED PERCENT IS THAT HAVING THAT. TAKING CARE OF SOMEONE IN THE. END ALSO HOSPICE WORKERS. IT'S ALSO REALLY IMPORTANT TO HAVE THOSE COMMUNICATION POUTS OPEN. I THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH HOSPICE IN ONE OF THE CASES WHERE ARM IT WAS THEIR FIRST CASE AND AND IT WAS REALLY EYE OPENING TO ME HOW LITTLE PREPARATION THAT GROUP HAD HAD. SO IT IS JUST A REMINDER TO THAT IT'S ONE THING TO THINK ABOUT IT ABSTRACTLY IT'S ANOTHER WHEN THE HUMANS THAT YOU KNOW AND CARE ABOUT ARE IN FRONT OF YOU ASKING COMPLEX. AMONG ABOUT THE TEAM TO HER. A MISTER IRVING. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. DIAZ I ENDED UP WITH A AT A PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WITH THE. FACT OF MY WIFE'S GREAT AUNTS I RECEIVED A TERMINAL DIAGNOSIS AND. AVAILED HERSELF OF IT. AND. THE THE PROCESS FOR HER WAS A VERY SIMPLE ONE. SHE WAS ABLE TO TIM I NAVIGATE THAT. AT IT TIE IT BROUGHT I THINK A GREAT DEAL OF PEACE AND COMFORT HER WHOLE FAMILY THAT SHE WAS ABLE TO MAKE THIS DECISION ON HER OWN ULTIMATELY. SHE PASSED AWAY A COUPLE OF DAYS BEFORE SHE HAD SET HER DATE. TO OUT TO DO IT. AND I THINK AMAZINGLY AND MAYBE BECAUSE I AS A LAWMAKER WHO VOTED ON IT I HAD MUCH% GREATER ANXIETY AS THE DATE APPROACHED. THEN HER DAUGHTER DEAD OR MY MOTHER AND MY DAD AND I AND DOT WHO WERE REALLY AT PEACE WITH THAT THERE OF MOTHER AND AUNT ABOUT THE DECISION. THAT THEY WERE MAKING FOR ABOUT FOR COMFORT FOR DIGNITY. AND ON AND SO FROM THAT VIEWPOINT IT IT REALLY WORKED A NUMBER OF WAYS. TO. TO TO HELP. EVEN THOUGH IT SHE SHE WAS ACTUALLY ABLE TO TO TO USE IT. ON. THE DATA SHOW US. SUN SOME NUMBERS THAT I DON'T KNOW IF I WOULD SAY THAT THEIR SURPRISING NUMBERS I DON'T KNOW IF I HAD. EXPECTATIONS ABOUT. HOW MANY PEOPLE WOULD BE USING IT ON AN ANNUAL BASIS OR HOW MANY DOCTORS WOULD BE PARTICIPATING? OR WHAT THE SOCIO ECONOMIC MAKEUP OF SOMEONE WOULD BE. I. KNOW I THINK OUR HOPE WAS IS THAT IT WOULD PROVIDE. AN OPTION FOR EVERYBODY CAN NEEDS IT. AND. I AND I THINK THAT THERE ARE. I I AGAIN I DON'T RECALL THEM SHORTCOMINGS BUT SOME GAPS IN HOW CALIFORNIANS ARE USING IT. BUT THE SOCIOECONOMIC WAY DEMOGRAPHICALLY. AND. ONE OF THE NUMBERS AT AGAIN THAT DIDN'T JUMP AT ME BUT ONE THAT I NOTICE WAS THE. ALONG WITH THE NUMBER OF PATIENTS. THE NUMBER OF PHYSICIANS WHO PARTICIPATED. AND I THINK THAT IN THE RUN UP TO. THE VOTE ON THE BILL. NO THERE ARE A LOT OF OF MYTHS AND CLAIMS ABOUT YOU KNOW. HOW THIS WOULD BE USED THAT I DON'T THINK WERE REALIZED ON IN A POSITIVE WAY? THAT. THERE WASN'T. IT DOES NOT APPEAR TO ME IN NUMBERS THAT. THERE IS THERE SOMETHING THAT'S NOT WORKING. IN A IN A NEFARIOUS WAY IS WHAT I MEAN AND AND THAT DON. ANY OF THE CONCERNS ABOUT. CERTAIN DOCTORS BEING THE DOCTORS THAT PEOPLE WOULD GO TO FOR THIS. ON IT SEEMED THE NUMBER OF DOCTORS AT PARTICIPATING AS JUST ONLY A BIT LESS THAN THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE AVAILING THEMSELVES OF THE OPTION. SO TO ME IT MEANS THAT. THERE ARE THAT. THEY'RE NOT BEING FUNNELED TO ONE OR TWO DOCTORS MANY PHYSICIANS ARE ABLE TO HELP THEIR PATIENTS. THAT DAY THAT THERE WHILE THERE MAY BE SOME BARRIERS TO HELPING ALL PATIENTS THAT IT'S NOT LIMITED TO JUST A CERTAIN NUMBER OF DOCTORS WHO ARE ABLE TO NAVIGATE AT WAR ARE PUSHING. THEIR PATIENCE TOWARD THIS OPTION IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE ANY OF THESE POSITIONS ARE. YOU KNOW ADVISING MORE THAN JUST A HANDFUL IF THAT GIVEN. THE SMALL NUMBER ABOVE THE TOTAL NUMBER OF PATIENTS AT OR BELOW THE TOTAL NUMBER PATIENTS OF PHYSICIANS. AND. AND SO JUST LOOKING AT THE DATA. AND THAT ANECDOTAL EXPERIENCES THAT I'VE HAD I'D LOVE TO HEAR YOU REFLECT A LITTLE BIT ON THAT. BUT SIDE BUT IT IT LOOKS LOOKS GOOD SO FAR TO ME ON ON WHAT SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED. I AM GLAD TO HEAR THAT YOU'RE KEEPING AN EYE ON THAT AS WELL SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR THEORY YOUR THOUGHTFULNESS THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT AT THE RANGE OF PHYSICIANS. ON AYE ANECDOTALLY AGAIN. IN MY OWN INSTITUTION INITIALLY THERE WERE ONLY TWO OF US THAT CAME OVER AT. UP FORWARD AT A FIFTEEN HUNDRED PHYSICIANS. AND WHEN WE DID THAT THAT TRAINING FOR AT. THOSE OF US THAT WERE WILLING SAID THAT WE WOULD BE WILLING TO HELP OTHERS THROUGH AND BY THIS I MEAN. I'M. CONTACTING THE OREGON AND WASHINGTON PHYSICIANS PUTTING TECH TALKING ACROSS THE STATE WITH MY COLLEAGUES AND THEN PROVIDING MENTORING FOR THOSE MORE CLOSE AND WE HAVE OVER A DOZEN NOW THAT I'VE PRESCRIBED AT MY INSTITUTION. AND MANY MORE THAT THAN THE HALF THAT HAVE THE HOW THE CONVERSATION. AGAIN THE DATA DOESN'T COLLECT THE THE CONVERSATION AND THAT IS HAPPENING ACROSS THE STATE THERE'S NO WAY TO GRAB IT IT'S IN THE PRIVACY OF OUR OFFICES WHERE IT BELONGS. AND. WE OWN YOU'LL ONLY FIND OUT ABOUT IT NOT ONLY AFTER THE FIRST COUPLE OF PRE LA ME THE FORMS AT CENTER BUT ACTUALLY PRESCRIPTION AND MANY LIKE IN YOUR CASE OF YOUR GREAT AT SOUTH LIKE YOUR FAMILY DID A LOVELY JOB OF SUPPORTING. HER IN HER OWN CHOICE WITH. WITHIN THE LAW UP MOST MANY PEOPLE ACTUALLY PASSED AWAY BEFORE WORD IN A DIFFERENT KIND OF WAY AND WE HAVE NONE OF. IT IS NO WAY TO CAPTURE THAT DATA BUT ANECDOTALLY I WOULD SAY THAT IT'S WHEN SOMEBODY THAT YOU KNOW AND CARE ABOUT COMES TO YOU AND ASKS YOU ABOUT IT. THAT SUDDENLY YOUR WILLINGNESS AND ABILITY TO GRASP IT GET INFORMATION AND PROVIDE EXCELLENT CARE COMES FORWARD AND THAT'S NOT DIFFERENT THAN OTHER THINGS THAT WE DO IN MEDICINE. WE ARE ALWAYS THE BEST EXPERTS ON OUR LAST CASE. WHICH IS AS IT SHOULD BE WE SHOULD ALL BE GEEKY AND CURIOUS OUR WHOLE CAREERS. BUT THAT'S MY THOUGHT ABOUT IT. I THINK YOU AND I WELCOME ALSO SAID DR CEDAR CREST THANK YOU FOR THANK YOU FOR JOINING US SO. OF I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO COME SHARE MY EXPERIENCES WITH THIS ISSUE. I'VE BEEN IN PRACTICES A POSITION FOR ABOUT TWENTY SEVEN YEARS NOW CAN. MUCH OF MY BACKGROUND WAS A WORKING IN HOSPICE AND PALLIATIVE MEDICINE SO I HAVE BEEN WITNESS TO MANY DOUBTS IN MANY DIFFERENT WAYS IN THE COURSE OF MY CAREER. WHEN AID IN DYING WAS INTRODUCED AS AN ALLOWABLE PRACTICE IN CALIFORNIA. I DID THIS IS A NATURAL EXTENSION OF THE CARE THAT WE ARE A PROVIDE AT THE END OF LIFE. DEATH HAS ALWAYS BEEN A PROFOUND. AT TIMES MESSY HEART WRENCHING PART OF THE HUMAN EXPERIENCE. AID IN DYING DOES NOT ELIMINATE THAT. THE PATIENTS I'VE CARED FOR OVER THE PAST ONE AND A HALF YEARS SINCE THIS HAS BEEN ALLOWED. WHO HAVE COME TO ME SEEKING AID IN DYING? HAVE TAUGHT ME A LOT ABOUT FACING ONE'S OWN DEATH. THEY'RE PEOPLE WHO OF A FIRM GRASP ON THE REALITY THAT THEIR LIVES ARE. A COMING TO AN END. THEY TELL ME THAT THEY ARE GRATEFUL FOR THEIR LIFE. AND THEY DON'T FEAR DEATH. BUT WHAT THEY DO FEAR IS. EXTENDED UNNECESSARY SUFFERING. BEFORE THEY DIE. OF COURSE WE ALWAYS DO OUR BEST TO ALLEVIATE THEIR SUCH SUFFERING AND IN THE MAJORITY OF CASES WERE ABLE TO DO THAT SUCCESSFULLY WITH GOOD SUPPORT OF HOSPICE PALLIATIVE CARE. BUT DESPITE OUR BEST EFFORTS. THERE ARE ALWAYS SOME CASES THAT WE CANNOT ACCOMPLISH THAT. THIS IS WHY I'VE ALWAYS BELIEVED THAT AID IN DYING. SHOULD BE A LAST RESORT BUT IT SHOULD BE AVAILABLE. THE POSITIVE ASPECT FOR ME. I HAS BEEN. MY EXPERIENCE THUS FAR. WITH THE PATIENTS WHO I OF PRESCRIBED IN DYING FOR. THEY HAVE YOU KNOW FORMALLY EXPERIENCE VERY PEACEFUL DOUBTS AT HOME WITH THEIR FAMILY UP THEIR SIDE. AND THEY'VE BEEN. VERY GRATEFUL FOR THIS. ABILITY TO TO DO SO. THIS TO ME IS A STARK CONTRAST FROM THE DEATHS THAT I SEE IN OUR ICE USE ON A DAILY BASIS. WHERE DEL FOOD BECOMES MEDICAL EYES DE PERSONALIZED INVASIVE AND SOMETIMES VIOLENT? FOR SOME REASON NOBODY SEEMS TO QUESTION ABOUT PRACTICE. I'M MUCH MORE AT PEACE WITH THE FORMER SCENARIO THAN I AM WITH THE LATTER. THE CHALLENGES. THE MOST SURPRISING ASPECT FOR ME. IN THESE CASES THAT I DID NOT ANTICIPATE. WAS THE SENSE OF URGENCY THAT PATIENTS HAVE ONCE THEY MAKE THIS DECISION. FOR THEM EVEN AT TWO TO THREE DELAY IN THE PROCESS SOMETIMES SEEMS TO BE EXCRUCIATING. ON THIS WAS NOT SOMETHING THAT I PERSONALLY ANTICIPATED SEEN. GIVEN THE MULTIPLE STEPS THAT ARE REQUIRED IN THE PROCESS. THERE ARE GONNA BE INEVITABLE DELAYS THIS IS. IN ALMOST NO CASE IS FIFTEEN DAY PROCESS. I DID IN IN EUROPE THEM JUST MEAN YOUR MEDICAL OPINION IS IS THE REQUIREMENTS WE LAID OUT TO OWNERS. I THINK THE CHALLENGE IS BALANCING SAFETY VERSES. HURDLES. AND WHICH WHICH IS WHAT THAT WHICH IS WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO RIGHT IN THE EMPLOYMENT TATIAN. RIGHT. AND I I THINK IT'S KIND OF. ON ON THE EDGE BETWEEN THOSE TWO ON THAT BALANCE. IN YOU KNOW IN MOST CASES IF IF THE PATIENT AS WELL ENOUGH TO TO MAKE THE VISITS I DON'T THINK IT'S BURDENSOME I THINK IF THEY DON'T START THE PROCESS UNTIL THEY'RE VERY FRAIL AND IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO THEM. FOR THEM TO MAKE THE MANDATED THREE OF FOUR VISITS IT BECOMES. VERY BURDENSOME. AND THAT'S THE CHALLENGE IS HOW HOW TO BALANCE THOSE. THE OTHER CHALLENGE THAT WE'VE ENCOUNTERED. IS THAT. SOME OF THE DELAYS THAT OCCUR ONE IS IF THAT PATIENT APPROACHES THE PHYSICIAN OR PHYSICIANS WHO HAVE BEEN CARING FOR THEM AND THOSE FIRST PARTICULAR PHYSICIANS ARE OPTING OUT. THEN THERE'S A DELAY OF REDIRECTING THEM TO ANOTHER PHYSICIAN WHO'S WILLING TO PARTICIPATE IN AID IN DYING. WORRIED. MOST CASES HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO THAT SUCCESSFULLY BUT THAT TAKES A LONG TIME. IF THE PATIENT HAS ALREADY ENROLLED IN HOSPICE SERVICE AND THEN REQUESTS AID IN DYING AND THEY NO LONGER HAVE ACCESS BACK TO THEIR TREATING PREVIOUS TREATING PHYSICIANS. AND THEY HOSPICES NOT PARTICIPATING. THAT BECOMES VERY DIFFICULT TO NAVIGATE BECAUSE NOW THEY HAVE TO OFTENTIMES PAY OUT OF POCKET TO GO BACK TO THE PREVIOUS POSITIONS PAY FOR THE THREE OR FOUR VISITS. MAKE THOSE APPOINTMENTS. AND THAT BECOMES OFTENTIMES A BUT A BIG HURDLE. AND AS I SAID THE TO THE PATIENTS ONCE ONCE THEY'RE VERY FRAIL AND IT DIFFICULT TO TO TRANSPORT IT BECOMES VERY HARD. FOR ME THE MOST DIFFICULT CASES I'VE ENCOUNTERED HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN THE PATIENTS WHO WANT AID IN DYING AND FOR VARIOUS REASONS DON'T QUALIFY. MOST OFTEN BECAUSE THEY'RE GIVEN AN EXTENDED PROGNOSIS. FOR THEM THE FACT THAT AID IN DYING IS AVAILABLE BUT THEY DON'T QUALIFY. SEEMS TO ACTUALLY WORSEN THEIR SUFFERING. AS ONE PATIENT COMMENTED TO ME IN THIS ODD KIND OF SITUATION THEY SAID. IT SAYS OF MIND MY SUFFERING DOESN'T MATTER. AND THAT'S BEEN. PAINFUL TO WITNESS. THAT ONE GROUP OF PATIENTS OF FALLS INTO THIS CATEGORY MORE OFTEN THAN NOT IS THE A LS PATIENTS. WHEN THEY'RE AT A POINT WHERE THEY CAN STILL. PHYSICALLY SELF ADMINISTER OFTENTIMES THEY DON'T YET HAVE A LESS THAN SIX MONTHS PROGNOSIS SO THEY'RE TRAPPED AND AND THOSE THIS REALLY CREATE SOME SUFFERING. AND SO SADLY I THINK BECAUSE THE OF THE. INORDINATE DIFFICULTY IN. OUR ABILITY TO ACCURATELY PROGNOSTICATOR AS A NAY AS IN ANY OTHER FORM OF TRYING TO PREDICT THE FUTURE. DIDN'T SOME OF THOSE PATIENTS WHO WANTED AID IN DYING WERE TOLD THEY HAVE A GREATER THAN SIX MONTHS PROGNOSIS OF THEY DIDN'T. A QUALIFIED. ACTUALLY ENDED UP DYING WITHIN A FEW MONTHS. OTHER PATIENTS WHO WE'VE DEEMED QUALIFYING GOT THE PRESCRIPTION SOME OF THEM LIVED FAR BEYOND THE SIX MONTHS WE HAD ONE PATIENT THAT GOT THE PRESCRIPTION OVER A YEAR LATER TOOK IT. SO I THINK GET WE HAVE WE HAVE A CHALLENGE SORTING OUT THE RIGHT PEOPLE WITHOUT WITHOUT LIMITATION. AND WE DON'T ALWAYS GET IT RIGHT. THEN IS THAT ALSO WOULD IT BE BETTER TO DO SIX MONTHS TO A YEAR MORE LEPTIN SYSTEM WITH HOSPICE. THAT'S SO THAT'S MY OPINION BECAUSE WE WE CAN'T PROGNOSTICATOR. SPECIFICALLY YOU INCUR. I TAKE A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT TACK IT IN TWO WAYS ONE IS. IF SOMEBODY'S IN ITS THE SAME AS I WOULD DO FOR HOSPICE IF SOMEBODY NEEDS TO RECERTIFY FOR HOSPICE BECAUSE BECAUSE THEY LIVED. THIS IS A GOOD THING IF THEY WANTED TO LET THIS IS A GOOD THING SO I'VE JUST SEE THEM BACK I'VE HAD IT HAPPEN TWICE AND. IN EACH TIME. THERE WAS JUST ACTUALLY PEOPLE WERE HAPPY WITH WHAT WAS HAPPENING THE SECOND IS THAT IN OUR INSTITUTION WE DON'T. WRITE THE PRESCRIPTION UNTIL RIGHT BEFORE THE PERSON IS GONNA TAKE ITS A THERE'S NOT MEDICATION AROUND AND FOR THAT REASON ON WEEK WE I KEEP CLOSE CONTACT SO THAT WE CAN. AND ANY OF THIS IS PARTLY BECAUSE EASILY FOR MEDICATIONS AS WELL AND SO WE KEEP CONTACTED THE POINT WHERE THEY'VE DECIDED THIS IS WHAT'S HAPPENING IS MONEY PRESCRIBES IT'S A LITTLE LESS OP PROBLEMATIC. ON IT IN IN THESE CASES BECAUSE OF HOW WE OF ORGANIZED AND HOW I ACTUALLY NOW TRAIN PEOPLE ARE IN THE FRONT LINES. THE OTHER THE OTHER DELAYS THAT I WOULD MENTION HERE ISPHARMACY DELAYS. GETTING THE PHARMACISTS WHO ARE FINDING OUT WHO THEY ARE AND TRAINED AT CENTER LIKE WE REALLY ONLY USE THREE PHARMACIES IN THE WHOLE BAY AREA RIGHT NOW. TIME AND WE'VE HAD SOME DELAYS IN GETTING MEDICATION SO THAT'S ANOTHER. ANOTHER A DELAY. I AGREE WITH THE ONE ABOUT IF THE ORIGINAL PHYSICIAN ATTENDING PHYSICIAN FOR THE DISEASE OR FOR THEIR AT AT AND OF LIFE BECAUSE THAT YOU CAN ATTEND EITHER. IS NOT PARTICIPANT. WHAT IS THE MECHANISM HOW DO WE MOVE SOMEONE INTO INTO AT ANOTHER PATHWAY TO HAVE ACCESS TO CARE? ALL HAS HAPPENED NUMEROUS TIMES ACTION. GOOD THEIR SECRETS AND THEN AT THE END I'D I'D ALSO LIKE TO KNOW WHERE TO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT PRESCRIBING IS IS. IS MEDICATION AVAILABLE AND IS IT STILL BOSSY SECOND ALL OR OR HER ARE PEOPLE DOING DIFFERENT THINGS NOW THAT. I CAN COMMENT ON THAT SO OUR OUR EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN THAT. SECOND ALL IS AVAILABLE AVAILABLE IT'S EXTREMELY COSTLY AND MOST PATIENTS OTHER THAN THE MEDI CAL PATIENTS. DON'T HAVE THAT. COVERAGE IN THEIR INSURANCE FORMULARIES AND I COMMITTEE ARE FROM THREE TO FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS. SO WE HAVE MOSTLY USED SECOND ALL FOR PATIENTS WITH MEDICAL COVERAGE FOR THOSE WITHOUT MEDI% CAL HAVE PRIVATE INSURANCE. WE HAVE RELIED HEAVILY ON ONE FARM ONE COMPOUNDING PHARMACY IN SAN DIEGO WHOSE GEARED UP TO. MAKE UP. A COMPOUNDED COCKTAIL OF. FOUR DIFFERENT MEDICATIONS AND THEY'VE REALLY WORKED OUT THE PROCESS WHERE THEY'RE ABLE TO DO THIS ON A ROUTINE BASIS BUT ALMOST NO OTHER PHARMACY WE FOUND IS ABLE TO DO THAT. BUT THAT STILL UP. OFTENTIMES A THREE THREE DAY PROCESS FOR THEM TO GET THE PAPERWORK AND DO THAT. I AGREE WE ALSO USE THE FOR COMPOUNDING AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS IS INTERESTIG IS TO TRY AND PULL TOGETHER WHAT IS THE BEST MEDICINE WHAT WE KNOW WHAT IS BEST PRACTICE. AND. SO WHAT WE'VE GOTTEN KINDS QUITE A BIT FROM THE WASHINGTON AND OREGON EXPERIENCE. TYPICALLY THE A BR WASHINGTON PHYSICIANS HAVE BEEN VERY GENEROUS ACROSS THE STATE WITH OTHER GROUPS AS WELL SO WE ALSO USE THE COCKTAIL FOR MEDICATIONS WHICH INCLUDE BENZODIAZEPINE OPIATES AND THEN. TO OTHER MEDICATIONS ARE AS WELL. YEAH AND THAT DOUBTS CLOSER TO ABOUT A FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR COST TIA. SO THAT THAT CUTS THE COST SIGNIFICANTLY INTENSE SEEM TO BE VERY. EFFECTIVE. I'M. OKAY THAT MISTER IRVING. YEAH YOU RUN KEEP TELL US ABOUT THAT A BIT ABOUT WHAT GOT PATIENT EXPERIENCES LIKE WHEN THEY TAKE THAT MEDICATION FROM. THE ONES THAT I'VE GOTTEN THE KIND OF DIRECT DESCRIPTION OF HOW IT'S IT'S SO. HAPPENED IS THAT WHAT THEY THEY DRINK A SLURRY OF THE MEDICATIONS AND WITHIN. BUT LESS THAN FIVE MINUTES THEY LOSE CONSCIOUSNESS. AND THEN THEY ARE REMAIN UNCONSCIOUS UNTIL THEY STOP BREATHING WHICH. CAN BE VERY QUICK IT CAN BE A HALF HOUR WE JUST HAD A PATIENT RECENTLY TAKEN AND TOOK A CLOSER TO TWENTY FOUR HOURS BEFORE THEY STOP BREATHING AND DIED. SO THAT THAT TIME FRAME IS HIGHLY UNPREDICTABLE AND VARIABLE. SO WE REALLY TRY TO PREPARE THE FAMILIES FOR THAT. POSSIBILITY THAT THERE'S A VARIABLE TIME FRAME IN IN THAT EXTENDED DEATH. THE PATIENT STILL FELL ASLEEP ABOUT FIVE MINUTES AND THEN TO VERY GRACIOUSLY FOR THOSE TWENTY FOUR HOURS YEAH AND THAT AND WHAT WHAT IS HAPPENING. TO THE BODY DURING THAT PERIOD. THEY'RE THEY'RE BREATHING JUST GRADUALLY SLOWS. IN HIS CASE BECAUSE IT WAS SO MANY HOURS. HE WAS EXHIBITING A LITTLE BIT OF GRIMACING WHICH MAY BE DUMB. PERCEIVED AS POSSIBLY A LITTLE BIT OF. AGITATION OR DISTRESS AND SO THE FAMILY HAD BEEN PREPARED TO TO GIVE THEM SOME SUB SUBLINGUAL. APPEAR IN A BENZODIAZEPINE TO TO. BUT I REALLY VOWED THAT GRIMACING UNTIL HE HE PASSED. THE THE PHYSICIAN THAT CARED FOR HIM AND PRESCRIBED ALL THIS. THOUGHT THAT PERHAPS FOR HIM AND TOOK LONGER BECAUSE HE'D BEEN ON FAIRLY HIGH DOSE OPIATES UP UNTIL THE TIME THAT HE AND JUSTIN THE MEDICATION AND SO. IT JUST YOU KNOW TOOK LONGER BECAUSE THE IDEA THAT I'M. TOLERANCE TO THAT THE OP A PORTION OF THE I'M COCKTAIL. IT'S PROLLY MAKE SENSE. BUT I AGREE I'VE BEEN PRESENT SEVERAL TIMES AND ON THE OTHER THING TO NOTE IS THAT THERE'S MEDICATIONS THAT ARE TAKEN IN ADVANCE OF THE SLURRY THAT TO FOR THE PERSON ABLE TO. PULL THE MEDICATIONS AND NOT HAVE THEM. VOMIT THEM OR OR AND ALSO TO HELP THEM MOVE THROUGH THAT GOT SO THEY CAN BE ABSORBED SO THERE'S ACTUALLY TWO ROUNDS OF MEDICATIONS. AGAIN SIMILARLY WE PREPARE THE FAMILY TO DO PALLIATIVE CARE IF IT TAKES LONGER THE QUIRK WASHINGTON AND OREGON PHYSICIANS THINK UP TO TWENTY FOUR HOURS IS. A IS WITHIN RANGE AND AND AND CERTAINLY MOST CASES ARE IN IN HOURS RATHER THAN MANY HOURS. SO I WOULD AGREE WITH THAT WITH THAT. AND MOST OF US STAY IN CONTACT WITH THE FAMILY DURING THE TIME PRETTY CLOSELY BAH BYE BY PHONE OR IN PERSON. YET MISTER STONEMAN AND DOCTOR QUIRK. BACK UP TO THAT THE ACCESS ISSUES ONE OF THE INTERESTING THINGS AS WE ARE GOING TO THE END OF LIFE OBSCENE ACT IN TRYING TO SORT OUT. SO LIABILITY QUESTIONS THAT THAT WE ANSWERED IN THERE THE WHOLE NOTION OF. PROGNOSIS CAME OUT BECAUSE IT'S AN INEXACT SCIENCE WE BUILT IN WHAT WE DID BECAUSE OF THE POLITICS OF IT SO YOUR EXPERIENCE. AND YOUR TESTIMONY AND HOW IT'S ACTUALLY OPERATING I THINK WILL BE VERY HELPFUL FOR US AS WE TRY AND FIGURE OUT. NEXT STEPS OF THEIR ARCTIC STEPS TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THIS MY QUESTION THOUGH SPECIFICALLY OF EITHER VIEW HAD EXPERIENCE OR KNOW OF EXPERIENCE. ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT CAME UP WITH THE CONCERNS THAT CAME UP WAS FROM THE DISABILITY COMMUNITY. WHO ARE BARRED FROM BEING ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS BECAUSE THEY CANNOT NECESSARILY TAKE THE MEDICATION THEMSELVES AND YOU BROUGHT UP SOME OF THE? THE REASONS THAT PEOPLE ARE ARE DYING OR EVEN SOMEONE WHO HAS OTHER UNRELATED DISABILITIES WHO IS DYING GOING THROUGH MEETS ALL THE CRITERIA. BUT FOR THE ABILITY TO TAKE THE MEDICATION THEMSELVES HAVE YOU HAD. DISABLED FOLKS ASK ABOUT THIS AND AND. BEEN DENIED THE ABILITY BECAUSE OF THE RESTRICTIONS WERE PUT IN THE IN THE LAW. YES I I RECALL ONE PATIENT PARTICULAR THAT WAS. I WENT THROUGH. HORRIBLE DISTRESS OVER THIS HE HAD A NARROW DEGENERATIVE DISORDER. SIMILAR TO A ALAS AND YOU KNOW UNTREATABLE AND HE AT THE POINT THAT HE CAME TO ME HE ONLY HAD USE OF ONE HAND. HE WAS OTHERWISE PRETTY MUCH COMPLETELY PARALYZED HE CAN STILL SWALLOW. AND HE WAS IN PAIN ALL THE TIME HE WAS BED BOUND. BUT AT THAT POINT IN TIME HIS NEUROLOGIST WAS ADAMANT THAT HE WAS. IT CERTAINLY DID. DISABLED BUT STABLE. AND HE DID NOT BELIEVE THAT THIS PATIENT WOULD DIE IN THE NEXT SIX MONTHS BUT UNFORTUNATELY HE MIGHT LOSE THE USE OF HIS HAND IN THE NEXT SIX MONTHS SO. THIS CREATED A HORRIBLE DISTRESS FOR THIS PATIENT. WHO A LIKE I SAID GOT GOT TRAPPED IN THAT? GROUP. I'VE I'VE HAD TO ONE THAT WANT ONE WAY AND ONE WENT TOGETHER I'M I HAD SOMEBODY WHO ON IT WE EXPAND THIS TO THE ETHICS COMMITTEE A PERSON WHO IF. DOT WHO WAS NO LONGER ABLE TO SWALLOW BUT COULD TAKE THE MEDICATIONS THROUGH THE G. TO. AND. IF SHE DIDN'T EAT IF SHE DIDN'T EAT OR DRINK SHE WOULD DIE AND SET THEM THEN THEN YOU'RE ALLOWED TO DO THAT BY LAW YOU CAN STOP EATING AND DRINKING IT'S A WAY OF REFUSING TREATMENT. AND THE QUESTION WAS IT COULD YOU ALSO DO WITH THIS. IF YOU'D REFUSE TO WERE NOT ABLE TO HAVE THAT TREATMENT THAT WOULD ALLOW YOU TO EAT AND DRINK TO YOU HOW TO BE E. EVEN DRINK THROUGH THE TUBE. AND THE ETHICS COMMITTEE SAID OUGHT KNOWS THAT YOU DO YOU DO YOU CAN ACTUALLY DO THAT IN THIS PARTICULAR PERSON'S CASE I WAS ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT DEPRESSION AND. AS IT TURNSOUT WHEN WE WERE ABLE TO TREAT DEPRESSION WE WERE ABLE TO. ISSUES THAT SHE MADE A DIFFERENT DECISION FOR HERSELF AND IT'S JUST A REMINDER HOW CRUCIAL IT IS FOR SOMEONE TO BE REALLY HEARD IN THEIR IN THEIR PAIN AND THEIR SUFFERING. THEIR DEFINITION OF SUFFERING NOT MY DEFINITION OF SUFFERING. I'M SO THAT'S A CASE WHERE THE PERSON ON A WAS DISABLED AND ARE IN THEIR OWN IN THEIR OWN WAY. I HAD TO HAVE SUCH A CASE WHERE SOMEONE THERE WAS CONCERN ABOUT COERCION. AND I WANT TO APPRECIATE THE IMPORTANCE OF. ATTEMPTING THE LIVES OF DISABLED PEOPLE WHO MAY BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT BE IT MAY BE BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT HONORED APPRECIATED OR WHATEVER SOCIETAL REASONS THAT ARE HAPPENING. THAT THEY MAY FEEL THAT THEY HAVE NO TREATMENT OPTIONS OR ACTUALLY AREN'T OFFER TREATMENT OPTIONS AND THAT THE LAW IS INTENDED TO PROTECT. FOR THAT AS WELL WITH TWO PEOPLE MAKING THE DETERMINATION OF SIX MONTHS OR LESS AND AT A JUDGMENT THE A QUICK JUDGEMENT TO SEE WHETHER NOT WE SHOULD BE DOING SOMETHING ELSE TO INTERVENE AND SOCIAL WORKER BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE OR PSYCHIATRY. DOT HAD SOMEBODY AND AND IT WAS ACTUALLY. LISTENING CAREFULLY TO THE DISABILITY COMMUNITY HAS SOME ONE OF THE REASONS I FEEL LIKE. THE AMOUNT OF BARRIERS THAT WE HAVE NOW WHILE ONEROUS FOR SOME ARE NECESSARY FOR SOME AS WELL AND I'M ON BOARD WITH THEM AND AND I. WOULD COMMENT I DO LIKE THE FACT THAT THE LAW MANDATES AT LEAST ONE CONVERSATION WITH THE PATIENT ALONE WHICH I THINK IS VERY IMPORTANT AND KIND OF IN A BUSY CLINIC. IT MIGHT BE EASY TO FORGET TO DO THAT SO I LIKE THAT IT'S BUILT THEM LIKE OKAY I'VE GOT TO DO THIS I'VE GOT A HOUSE THE FAMILY LEAVE BEEN. AND IN EVERY CASE I'VE HAD WHERE I'VE DONE THAT I I FELT MUCH BETTER THIS YA GOTTA MELONES THIS REALLY WHAT YOU WANT AND. YOU KNOW I FELT VERY ASSURED THAT THIS WAS REALLY BEING DRIVEN BY THEM AND NOT THEIR FAMILY BECAUSE SOME OF THESE PATIENTS BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN SO ILL. AND DEBILITATED FOR SO LONG FAMILY MEMBERS STEP IN AND THEY BECOME THE. COMMUNICATOR FOR THEM AND THEY COME AND THEY WANT TO DO ALL TALKING AND YOU KNOW PRETTY SOON THE PATIENT'S KINDA LOST WHERE THEY'VE THEY'VE HANDED THIS. ROLL OVER TO THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS AT SOMETHING LIKE THIS ONE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE NOT DRIVING AT THAT IT IS FROM THE PATIENT. IT AND WE WERE VERY COGNIZANT OF THAT BUT THERE ARE CERTAIN PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES WHO WOULD OTHERWISE QUALIFY BUT WON'T AND THEY HAVE EXPRESSED SOME FRUSTRATION. WITH THE NOTION OF COURSE AND THEN AND PEOPLE DISABILITIES IN THEIR ADVOCATES REALLY DO UNDERSTAND THIS THAT THERE ARE SOME OF THE SUCH% UNFORTUNATELY WHO ARE GETTING THE MESSAGE FROM THEIR FAMILY YOU WOULD WE WOULD BE BETTER OFF. IF YOU MADE THIS DECISION WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT WE DON'T WANT THROUGH THIS PROCESS AND BUILDING IN. CHECKS AND BALANCES BUT AS WE LEARNED ABOUT IT IN FOR POLICY MAKERS STANDPOINT. ZIP TO BE UNDERSTANDING OF. THE. THOSE NUANCES AND INSURING THAT THE PROGRAM WILL BE SUCCESSFUL THAT WERE. ABSOLUTELY OF WINNIE ANY COERCION OR ANY OTHER DECISION ALONG THAT LINE. BUT STILL ENSURING THAT PEOPLE WHO. NEED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE WHO WANTS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS AS AN OPTION AND EVEN IF IT'S JUST THE PEACE OF MIND OPTION. THEN THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO TO CONSIDER THAT SO WE. WE HAVE A LOT A LOT OF WORK TO DO BUT YOUR EXPERIENCE YOUR TEACHING THE THINGS THAT YOU'RE BRINGING TO US NOW OVER TIME. WILL HELP US SORT THROUGH ALL OF THE CITY RECOMMENDATIONS VERY POOR AND FOREST'S. AND AND ONE ONE THING WE'VE BEEN. RECENTLY DELIBERATING ON BECAUSE OF A PATIENT THEY GOT STALLED BECAUSE SHE CAN GET OUT THE HOUSE TO GET THE UNTIL NEXT APPOINTMENT WAS AND THE LAWS SILENT ON THIS WHETHER. ANY OF THESE VISITS CAN BE DONE VIA TELEMEDICINE. BUT SINCE OF SILENT THAT WE WOULD PRESUME IT'S ALLOWABLE AND WE'RE STARTING TO TALK ABOUT THAT OPTION THAT IF IT. WE PREFER TO HAVE THE PATIENT WITH US BUT IN A CASE WHERE THERE REALLY BED BOUND THIS IS REALLY BURDENSOME COULD WE SET UP YOU KNOW AT LEAST ONE OR TWO OF THE VISITS TO BE VIA TELEMEDICINE AND. AND THAT WOULD TAKE CARE OF ONE OF THE HURDLES THAT SOMETIMES ARISES. TOOK A QUICK. ARE JUST BRIEFLY SECOND ALL I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT WOULD BE A GENERIC THAT COULD BE MANUFACTURED FAIRLY INEXPENSIVELY Y. ISSUE THREE TO FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS. YOU WOULD HAVE TO ASK THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY THAT THERE'S NO REASON. COST WINNER RIGHT AFTER WE PASSED THE ACT MISTER YEAH. YEAH LA ITS PRICE GOUGING SURPRISING NELSON THANK YOU. SO I GUESS AS A RESULT OF MY EXPERIENCES THE CHANGES I WOULD CONSIDER THAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE. US AGAIN I WAS THAT ONE TO TOUCH ON THE OPTION OF INTRODUCING TELEMEDICINE END OF THIS PROCESS. I THINK OUR ORGANIZATIONS IN GENERAL PRACTICES IN GENERAL ALSO NEED TO SUPPORT CLINICIANS WHO ARE WILLING TO ENABLE THEM TO BE DOING HOME VISITS. RIGHT NOW YOU KNOW MOST ARE PRACTICES JUST DON'T ALLOW YOU THE TIME OF THE LUXURY TO GO TO SOMEONE'S HOME BUT MANY OF US WOULD BE WILLING TO DO THAT. IF NEEDED. ALL THE CHALLENGES AROUND HOSPICE NON PARTICIPATION TO ME AS CREATIVELY A LOT OF HURDLES FOR THESE PATIENTS SO. I WOULD REALLY ENCOURAGE INCREASED JOB PARTICIPATION BY HOSPICE ORGANIZATIONS. IF I COULD CHANGE THE LAW. I WOULD CONSIDER REDUCING THE MANDATED FIFTEEN DAY TIMEFRAME BETWEEN ATTENDING VISITS DOWN TO MAYBE SEVEN TO TEN DAYS WHICH. AS I DESCRIBED EARLIER THESE EVERY FEW TWO TO THREE DAYS ADDED DELAYS FOR THESE PATIENTS CAN SOMETIMES BE EXCRUCIATING. AND I DON'T THINK THERE WOULD BE A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A TEN VERSES A FIFTEEN DAY TIME FRAME. AND THEN CONSIDERING THE POSSIBILITY OF EXTENDING THE PROGNOSIS FROM LESS THAN SIX MONTHS TO ANNOUNCE LESS THAN TWELVE MONTHS. TO TO ALLOW SOME THESE OTHER VERY SUFFERING PATIENTS. ACCESS. SO. IN CLOSING. I RECOGNIZE THE NEED TO HAVE PARAMETERS LIMITATIONS TO THE PRACTICES OBEYED AND DYING. A WILL NEVER WILL LIKELY NEVER ACHIEVE A PERFECT BALANCE BETWEEN THESE TWO. DESPITE SUCH CHALLENGES I FIRMLY BELIEVE ALLOWING AID IN DYING IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION TO SUPPORT PATIENT SELF DETERMINATION AND AUTONOMY IN THEIR OWN CARE SO. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR ALLOWING US TO COME. THANK YOU BOTH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY CLEARLY WE COULD TALK TO YOU ALL DAY. AND IT'S ABOUT MY NO FOR ALL OF US FASCINATING OR HOME FASTENINGS WERE BUT. THERE WAS SO I MEAN THERE WERE. SO MUCH NEGOTIATING AND AND DIALOGUE AROUND. EVERY PIECE OF POLICY WE SET UP SODA TO BE ABLE TO HEAR. HOW IT WE HOW IT WORKS IN REAL LIFE? IS I MEAN IT IT IT IS BRINGS A FULL CIRCLE FOR POLICY MAKERS AND SEE THEN HOW WE CAN IMPROVE IT. GOING FORWARD I COMPLETE MY DISSERTATION IN TWO THOUSAND TWO ONE AND OF LIFE AND AT THAT TIME WHEN THE BIG TAKEAWAYS WAS WE REALLY NEEDED TO HAVE A LOT MORE CONVERSATIONS WITH PHYSICIANS AND ANY TRAININGS. A AROUND AND OF LIFE AND HOW WE HOW WE TALK ABOUT THAT. SO IT'S GOOD TO SEE IS MOVING ALONG AND I THINK I I HERE YOU GO ST CAN STILL MOVE MORE BUT I THINK HOPEFULLY WITH THE PASSAGE OF THIS. IT ALSO JUST PROVIDES A ONE MORE IMPETUS FOR US TO HAVE FULL DIALOGUES AROUND WHAT ARE OPTIONS AND OF LIFE. THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH FOR YOUR THINK THINK YOU I JUST WANT TO TAKE TO AREN'T RE EDIT THEM TO AGREE TO AL WITH DARK SECRETS ABOUT THE TELE TELEMEDICINE. WE TAKE CARE PEOPLE ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND IT WOULD BE IT WOULD ACTUALLY BE AYE I THINK A GREAT SERVICE TO THOSE PATIENTS NOT THE ONE WE HAVE TO SPEAK TO THEM PRIVATELY BUT AT LEAST ONE OF US THEY DON'T HAVE TO TRAVEL AS FAR. THANK YOU THANK YOU. I WOULD JUST POINT OUT ON THAT MADAM CHAIR THERE'S NOTHING IN THE LAW AS WRITTEN PROHIBITS TELEMEDICINE. WE HAVE A VERY BIG STATES OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND NEXT UP. UP FROM THE HEALTH SYSTEM PERSPECTIVE WE HAVE BY AND YOU CAN ALL COME TO THE SAME TOM TIME DOCTOR NEEDS AND FAIRMAN FROM UC DAVIS DR CINDY CAME UCLA AND DOCTOR NEIL. WHITNER FROM UCLA. WELCOME TO ALL OF YOU. AND MELISSA STERN FROM CHRIST. NOW MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS AT THANK YOU FOR HAVING US IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE HERE A MINUTE UP TRY KEEP MY COMMENTS BRIEF BECAUSE I SUSPECT THERE'S GOING TO BE QUITE A BIT OF REDUNDANCY NAM. BETWEEN ABOUT FORTY MINUTES FOR YOUR SECTION SURE SO. NOT JUST YOU HOW. BY BRIEF I MET FORTY MINUTES FOR ME. THURSDAY. MY NAME IS NATHAN FAMINE I'M A DOCTOR AT UC DAVIS AND I WHERE. A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT HATS THERE I'M I PRACTICE IN THE HOSPITAL IN PALLIATIVE CARE AND ALSO IN PSYCHIATRY. AND I WORK IN THE CANCER CENTER I RUN A CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY THERE AND I DIRECT SUPPORT ONCOLOGY SERVICES IN THE CANCER CENTER. AND IN THE MEDICAL SCHOOL I DIRECT BIOETHICS EDUCATION. SO I I WHERE A BUNCH DIFFERENT HATS I MADE A DECISION ABOUT. AROUND THE TIME THE LAW PASSED THAT I MYSELF WOULD PARTICIPATE AS AS A PROVIDER. AND I'VE DONE SO IN THE ROLE OF AN ATTENDING AND ALSO THE CONSULTANT AND ALSO AS A MEDICAL SPECIALIST. THAT HAPPEN I'M WEARING THIS MORNING THOUGH IS THAT I'M THE MEDICAL DIRECTOR OF THE END OF LIFE OPTION ACT PROGRAM AT UC DAVIS AND I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU. FROM AN INSTITUTIONAL PERSPECTIVE SOME OF THE ELEMENTS OF OUR PROCESS FOR DEVELOPING OUR POLICY. AND SOME OF THE SUCCESSES WE'VE HAD AND A FEW OF THE CHALLENGES AS WELL. SO. IN TERMS OF DEVELOPING OUR POLICY THE. OUR POLICY COMES OUT OF THE MEDICAL STAFF. AND ADMINISTRATION OFFICE IN THE HEALTH SYSTEM AND. AFTER THE LAW WAS PASSED. AND BEFORE WE WENT INTO A FACT OUR CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER CONVENE TO WORK GROUP WHICH I CHAIR WHICH HAS REPRESENTATION FROM. PATIENT CARE SERVICES IN THE HOSPITAL THE CANCER CENTER OUR PHARMACY OUR PRIMARY CARE NETWORK I'M OUR PALETTE OF CARE PROVIDERS AYE UC DAVIS OPERATES AN IN HOUSE HOSPICES WHILE IN A I HAD MEMBERSHIP AND THAT WORKER TO. I SAID THAT GROUP CAME TOGETHER TO DEVELOP THE POLICY. AND. ARE I WANNA JUST CHAIR A FEW ELEMENTS OF OUR POLICY BECAUSE THEY. SPEAK TO A COUPLE OF STEPS THAT GO ABOVE AND BEYOND ARE THE ELEMENTS IN THE LAW. ARE. ARE PROCESS INVOLVES A ROLE FOR A PATIENT NAVIGATOR. AND THAT'S NOT UNCOMMON IN INSTITUTIONS ARE OUR NAVIGATOR IS AN LCSW. AND THEY. PROVIDE TWO FUNCTIONS ONE IS. ONE IS A NAVIGATION FUNCTION FOR THE PATIENT ON THE PROVIDER TO HELP THEM. GETS THROUGH THE SAFEGUARDS THAT ARE IN THE LAW. BUT THE SECOND IS A CLINICAL ROLLED THE LCSW DOES A PSYCHOSOCIAL ASSESSMENT WHICH. WE CONCEIVE AS ESSENTIALLY AND INITIAL BROAD PALETTE OF CARE SUSSMAN. TRYING TO IDENTIFY UNMET NEEDS FOR SUPPORT. THAT WILL HELP THE PHYSICIAN PROM PARTICIPANTS IN. ADDRESSING THOSE NEEDS. ANOTHER ELEMENT THE POLICY AS I MENTION IS THAT THERE'S A ROLE FOR MEDICAL DIRECTOR. I HAVE SUPPORTED TIME. TO HELP WITH OUR EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMMING. I DO DOCTOR DOC CONSULTATION ON ALMOST ALL OF THE CASES THAT COME BEFORE US. THE PENSION NAVIGATORS AND I ROUND WEEKLY ON ALL THE CASES THAT WE'RE CONSIDERING. AND. I HAVE AN ACCOUNTABILITY AND REPORTING FUNCTION WITH OUR CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER AND THEN RUN THE THIS WORKGROUP MEETING THAT IS ITERATIVELY LOOKING AT OUR POLICY. OUR OUR WORK FLOW ALSO INVOLVES A SET OF DOCUMENTATION TEMPLATES WHICH WERE BUILT AND INCORPORATED INTO ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORD. A THE AIM OF WHICH IS TO HELP. MAKE MORE EFFICIENT THE PROCESS FOR PROVIDERS HAVE CHOSEN TO PARTICIPATE. AND ALSO TO KEEP THEM IN COMPLIANCE. AND THEN THERE SEVERAL LAYERS OF OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY. THAT ARE BUILT INTO OUR POLICY. WHY ONE IS THAT WITH EACH FORMAL REQUEST OF AN ATTENDING PHYSICIAN? THAT REQUEST TRIGGERS A NOTIFICATION TO THE. TO OUR LEGAL DEPARTMENT TO THE ON CALL BIOETHICS CONSULTANT TO THE CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER AND TO OUR SENIOR PHARMACIST. JUST TO LET THEM KNOW THAT THERE'S A NEW CASE THAT'S IN THE PIPELINE. I MENTIONED THAT WE ROUND WEEKLY ON ALL THE CASES BEFORE US. OUR HEALTH SYSTEM WORK GROUP. MEETS MONTHLY AND. AND HAS A A PROCESS WHERE THEY WERE WE REVIEW SOME OF THE. MORE CHALLENGING CASES THAT WE'VE HAD. AND THEN RETROSPECTIVELY ALL QUALIFIED. OUT CASES OF PATIENTS WHO QUALIFIED ARE REVIEWED RETROSPECTIVELY BY OUR. BY OUR BIOETHICS COMMITTEE AND THEY. REPORT BACK TO THE HOUSE SYSTEM WORK GROUP TO GET RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT. REFINEMENTS IT MIGHT BE NEEDED FOR THE POLICY. SO THAT I HOPE JUST GIVES A SENSE OF SOME OF THE. IN A BRIEF Y. SOME OF THE STEPS THAT WENT INTO DEVELOPING OUR POLICY. HELPED APPOINT TO A COUPLE OF THINGS AND I THINK SHE AS SUCCESSORS AND THEN A FEW CHALLENGES. IN TERMS OF SUCCESSES IT IN OUR EARLY DISCUSSIONS IN THE HOUSE SYSTEM IT WAS. FELT TO BE A VERY IMPORTANT POSITION AID IN DYING AS AN OPTION OF LAST RESORT. AND THAT. DOT LANGUAGE ACTUALLY COMES FROM THE AFFECTS LITERATURE IN THE PALETTE OF CARE LITERATURE THAT LOOKS AT AS DOCTOR SEAT ACROSS SHOOTER CHRIS MENTIONED EARLIER THAT. ESSENTIALLY SAYS THAT IN MOST CASES HIGH QUALITY PALETTE OF CARE IS EFFECTIVE. AT ALLEVIATING THE SUFFERING WHICH MIGHT OTHERWISE PRINT SOMEONE TO PURSUE AN EIGHT AND NINE DRUG. BUT NOT IN ALL CASES AND. SO THE IDEA FOR US INSTITUTIONALLY IS THAT IF WE'RE GOING TO PARTICIPATE IN THE US AND WE NEED TO DO SO IN THE CONTEXT WHERE PATIENTS HAVE GOOD ACCESS TO ARMS. RETAIN ON THE FLIGHT CARE. AND THE EVIDENCE THAT WE'VE BEEN SUCCESSFUL WITHOUT ISN'T ALL OF OUR QUALIFIED PATIENTS HAVE BEEN ENROLLED IN EITHER HOSPICE OR I'M A SIMILAR PROGRAM THAT'S CALLED HOME BASE PALETTE OF CARE. SO I WOULD CONSIDER THAT A SUCCESS. AND WE'VE ALSO BEEN QUITE SUCCESSFUL IN MY VIEW WITH EDUCATIONAL OUTREACH WHICH ARM AS MENTIONED EARLIER IS A REAL CHALLENGE. WE'VE. DIDN'T THIS IS LARGELY FALLEN UNDER MY RESPONSIBILITY BUT WE'VE CREATEDTO. CME SESSIONS AND ON OUTREACH TO NEARLY ALL PHYSICIANS IN OUR IN OUR HOUSE SYSTEM. AND WE'VE ALSO DONE ARE SIMILAR EDUCATIONAL OUTREACH TO SEVERAL OF THE FELLOWSHIP IN RESIDENCY PROGRAMS. WITH ALSO AND CREATED A THREE HOUR. STANDARDIZED PATIENT BASED DIDACTIC FOR MEDICAL STUDENTS ARE ALL MEDICAL STUDENTS TECH THAT LAST YEAR AND WERE DOING THE NEXT ONE THIS YEAR IN A FEW WEEKS. AND WE'VE ALSO DONE SOME OUT RICH WITH OTHER NON PHYSICIAN GROUPS AND OUR HOUSE SYSTEM TO HELP IMPROVE THEIR EDUCATION ABOUT THE LAW. AND US ABOUT OUR POLICY. THE LAST THING I WOULD SAY. WHICH I'M I'M PARTICULARLY PROUD OF IS THAT I THINK WE'VE BEEN EFFECTIVE IN LEVERAGING INTEREST AND THIS LAW. TO. CREATE EXPANDED ACCESS TO PALLIATIVE CARE. AND THERE'S THERE'S AN INTERESTING PARALLEL INSTITUTIONALLY ARMS TO WHAT HAPPENS ARE IN THE CLINIC. WHAT WHAT WE TELL PROVIDERS IS THAT WHEN A PATIENT ASKS YOU ABOUT THIS LAW? OFTEN THAT QUESTION IS UNDIFFERENTIATED THAT REALLY ASKING YOU FOR HELP UNDERSTANDING WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN TO THEM AND WHAT. HOW THEIR DISEASE WILL PROGRESS WHAT SYMPTOMS MAY EMERGE HOW THEY GET THE SUPPORT THAT THEY NEED? AND SHOW THAT THAT'S A THAT'S NOT AN UNFAMILIAR QUESTION FOR A PALETTE OF CARE PROVIDER. AND THE IDEAS THAT FROM DOWN THE INTEREST AND THE END OF LIFE OPTION ACT YOU ARE ABLE TO HAVE A VERY BROAD AND TERADYNE DISCUSSION WITH THE PATIENT. IN THE SAME THING'S HAPPENING INSTITUTIONALLY YOU KNOW THE. THE LEGISLATURE AND AND AND THE PUBLIC ARE TELLING US THAT THEY WANT ACCESS TO THIS OPTION WE'VE USE THAT TO LEVERAGE HAN. A GREATER ACCESS TO PALLET OF CARE. THE EVIDENCE FOR THAT IS THAT ARMOR HOUSE SYSTEM MADE A VERY LARGE INVESTMENT AND. EXPANDING PALETTE OF CARE INTO OUR PRIVATE CARE NETWORKS AND TO THE CANCER CENTER ARM AND ALSO ARE SOME STAFFING IMPROVEMENTS A PALETTE OF CARE IN THE HOSPITAL AND I DON'T THINK THOSE ARE COINCIDENTAL. IN TERMS OF CHALLENGES ARMED. THEY ARE OUT HOW POINT OUT TO VERY BRIEFLY BECAUSE I THINK THERE WERE ALL OF US WOULD PROBABLY AGREE THESE ARE ISSUES ON. PHYSICIAN PARTICIPATION IS LOW AND. THAT PRESENTS A CHALLENGE HAS DOCTOR SEAT A QUEST NIGHTFORCE MENTIONED WHEN A PATIENT MAKES A REQUEST TO A DOCTOR WHO KNOWS THEM BUT HAS CHOSEN NOT TO PARTICIPATE. WE'VE HAD TO. COME UP WITH THAT AN EFFICIENT PROCESS TO GET THOSE PATIENTS QUICKLY REFERRED TO PARTICIPATING PROVIDERS. AND ON IN THE SAME VEIN WE'VE HAD TO PAY ATTENTION TO HOW TO SUPPORT THOSE PROVIDERS SO THAT THEIR PRACTICE ISN'T EXCLUSIVELY ENRICHED IN. IN END OF LIFE OPTION ACT. QUERIES. SO THAT'S BEEN ON CHALLENGE HOW TO DO THAT THE OTHER. THE OTHER HAS CHALLENGE HAS BEEN THAT WE'VE FOUND THAT THIS. PROCESS REQUIRES A LOT OF MANAGEMENT. IT AND IN SOME RARE CASES AT THE PATIENT. THEMSELF. HAS THE RESOURCES TO SORT OF SUPPLY THAT MANAGEMENT THEY'RE FEELING WELL ENOUGH AND THAT GOT HIGH HEALTH LITERACY THEY'RE VERY EFFECTIVE ADVOCATES AND THEY CAN PUSH ON TO GET THROUGH THE STEPS IN THE PROCESS. IN OTHER CASES OF POSITION MIGHT BE MOTIVATED. TO PROVIDE SOME OF THAT MANAGEMENT BUT IN MOST CASES IT REQUIRES A LOT OF WORK ARE BY THE PATIENT NAVIGATOR. ARM TO HELP. SHEPHERD THE PROCESS ALONG AND I THINK. I THINK THAT IT REQUIRES THAT MUCH MANAGEMENT. REPRESENTS A POSSIBILITY THAT THERE WILL BE SOME ISSUES AND FAIRNESS AND ACCESS WHICH WE WERE ALLUDED TO EARLIER SNOW. AND THINK FOR MY TIME AND BE HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS. I THINK WE'LL WE'LL HEAR FROM EVERY PERSON IN AND THEN GO BACK I THINK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I MY NAME IS CINDY KANE AND I'M A FACULTY MEMBER AT UCLA AND HEALTH POLICY AND MANAGEMENT WHICH IS PART OF THE SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH. AND I'M HERE TO REPORT ON SOME OF THE RESEARCH WE'RE DOING AT UCLA RELATED TO HOW DIFFERENT HEALTH SYSTEMS ACROSS THE STATE HAVE RESPONDED TO THE END OF LIFE OPTION ACT. BEFORE YOU TELL YOU ABOUT THE PARTICULARS OF THE STUDY I'D LIKE TO NOT ACKNOWLEDGE THE CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION. AND THE STOP SKI FOUNDATION FOR THEIR SUPPORT IN THIS RESEARCH. SO WHILE THE END OF LIFE OPTION ACT MADE PHYSICIAN AID IN DYING LEGALLY AVAILABLE TO CALIFORNIANS THE LAW ALSO ALLOWS PROVIDERS AND HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS TO CHOOSE NOT TO PARTICIPATE. SO SOME HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS HAVE DECIDED NOT TO PROVIDE PHYSICIAN AID IN DYING AT ALL OR IN SOME CASES EVEN NOT ENGAGE IN DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE OPTION. OTHERS HAVE DECIDED TO PROVIDE THE OPTION UNDER SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES AND DEFINE THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES AND PROCESS SEASON A VARIETY OF WAYS. AND STILL OTHERS HAVE DECIDED TO LEAVE THE DECISIONS ENTIRELY UP TO PHYSICIANS ABOUT IF THEY WILL PARTICIPATE AND WHAT IMPLEMENTATION LOOKS LIKE FOR THEM. WE CURRENTLY DO NOT HAVE ADEQUATE ESTIMATES OF THE PROPORTION OF HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS THAT HAVE ADOPTED EACH OF THESE DIFFERENT STRATEGIES. AND AS A PRACTICAL MATTER THE DECISIONS AT THE ORGANIZATIONS MAKE INFLUENCE THE KINDS OF DECISIONS THAT PATIENTS CAN MAKE AND ULTIMATELY INFLUENCE THESE QUESTIONS OF ACCESS. SO UCLA WE ARE CURRENTLY CONDUCTING AN ASUS A SYSTEM SURVEYS SO WE'VE DESIGNED A SURVEY OF HEALTH SYSTEMS ACROSS THE STATE. WE WANT TO UNDERSTAND HOW MANY OF THE SYSTEMS HOW OF POLICIES IN PLACE AND WHAT THOSE POLICIES INCLUDE AND WHAT THOSE POLICIES DON'T INCLUDE. WE'RE CURRENTLY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DATA COLLECTION STAGE AND SO FORMAL RESULTS FROM THIS ANALYSIS WILL BE. A AVAILABLE ONCE THE DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS IS COMPLETE. BUT WE DO HAVE A FEW INITIAL. IMPRESSIONS THAT WE THINK MAY INFORM SOME OF THESE QUESTIONS ABOUT IMPLEMENTATION OF THE END OF LIFE OPTION THAT. SO MANY OF THESE THINGS YOU'VE HEARD FROM OTHERS SPEAKERS TODAY AND I'M SURE YOU'LL HEAR THROUGHOUT THE DAY. SO I'D LIKE TO REAFFIRM THE IMPORTANCE OF OF SOME OF THESE POINTS. SO FIRST VERY LITTLE PUBLIC INFORMATION EXISTS ABOUT HOW DIFFERENT HOLE SYSTEMS HAVE CREATED POLICIES AND WHAT THOSE POLICIES INCLUDE. SO BECAUSE OF THIS IT'S LIKELY DIFFICULT FOR PATIENTS TO KNOW IF THERE PROVIDERS WOULD BE ABLE TO WRITE PRESCRIPTIONS REGARDLESS OF THE INDIVIDUAL PROVIDERS OWN PERSPECTIVE. AND EVEN BEYOND ACCESS TO THE OPTION IN TERMS OF IF A POLICY EXISTS OR NOT. WE'VE HEARD FROM SEVERAL PROVIDERS WHO HAVE TAKEN OUR SURVEY ALREADY THAT PATIENTS LACK KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE PROCESS. AND THAT THEY WISH FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT IF THE OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO THEM AS WELL AS THE STEPS THAT THEY HAVE TO TAKE. BOTH THE STEPS THAT ARE DETERMINED BY THE LAWS WELLS THE STEPS THAT ARE DETERMINED BY THE ORGANIZATIONS THEMSELVES. WELL SOME HEALTH SYSTEMS HAVE EXPRESSED CONCERNS ABOUT MAKING THEIR POLICIES AND PROCEDURES AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC. MANY PROVIDERS HAVE SAID THAT THIS TYPE OF STEP WOULD MAKE IT EASIER FOR PATIENTS TO FIND INFORMATION. MANY HAVE ALSO EXPRESSED LOW THAT THE A CONSOLIDATION OF INFORMATION ABOUT THESE POLICIES ABOUT DIFFERENT APPROACHES NEED TO BE COMING FROM NEUTRAL SOURCES AND INCLUDE THE ENTIRE RANGE OF END OF LIFE APPROACHES. NOT JUST THE END OF LIFE OPTION ACT. pHEARD QUITE A BIT. IS THAT PROVIDERS FROM A DIVERSITY OF ORGANIZATIONAL SETTINGS HAVE REPORTED THAT WHEN THERE'S A PROVIDER WHO IS NOT WILLING OR ABLE TO WRITE A PRESCRIPTION FOR THE INDICTMENT OCCASIONS. IT'S DIFFICULT TO KNOW WHAT TO DO NEXT FOR THE PATIENTS WHO ARE SURE THAT THIS IS THE RIGHT OPTION FOR THEM. SOME OF PROVIDERS HAVE REQUESTED A DIRECTOR TO DIRECTORY A REPOSITORY OF NAMES A PROVIDERS WHO ARE WILLING TO SERVE AS ATTENDING PHYSICIANS. AND SOME ORGANIZATIONS HAVE EVEN TRIED TO CREATE SUCH A REPOSITORY. HOWEVER MANY OF THEM HAVE ALSO REPORTED THAT THEY HAVE RESISTANCE FROM PROVIDERS WHO DON'T WANT TO BE KNOWN AS THE AID IN DYING DOCTOR. SO THIS IS A CONTINUING CONCERN. AN ADDITIONAL COMPLICATION FOR KNOWING WHAT TO DO WITH A PATIENT WHO MAKES A REQUEST TO A NON PARTICIPATING PHYSICIAN OUR SYSTEM. IS THAT MANY SYSTEMS WHO ARE PARTICIPATING OR PROVIDERS WHO ARE PARTICIPATING ARE UNWILLING TO TAKE ON PATIENTS SOLELY FOR THE PURPOSE OF USING THE END OF LIFE OPTION ACT. WELL PATIENTS CERTAINLY CAN STILL RECEIVE HIGH QUALITY PALLIATIVE CARE IN END OF LIFE CARE EVEN IN A NON PARTICIPATING SYSTEM WE NEED MORE INFORMATION ABOUT HOW TO EFFECTIVELY AND. SUPPORT PEOPLE IN A TIMELY WAY WHEN THEY'RE SURE THAT THIS IS THE RIGHT OPTION FOR THEM. THE FINAL THING THAT ALL SAY THAT WE'VE LEARNED FROM OUR IMPRESSIONS FROM THE SURVEY IS THAT WHILE MANY ORGANIZATIONS HAVE CONSIDERED HOW TO CREATE INTERNAL PROCESSES FOR HANDLING REQUESTS FOR THE MEDICATIONS. SEVERAL REPORT THAT THEIR CHALLENGES WITH COORDINATING WITH OTHER SETTINGS AND SO THE TWO SETTINGS WE CARE ABOUT MOST OFTEN ARE PHARMACY AND HOSPICE WHICH WE'VE ALREADY TALKED A BIT ABOUT TODAY. OF FINING PHARMACIES THAT WILL FILL THE PRESCRIPTIONS HAS BEEN CHALLENGING FOR MANY OF THE ORGANIZATIONS ESPECIALLY A COMPOUNDING PHARMACY IS NOT AVAILABLE. AND ADDITIONALLY MOST ORGANIZATIONS PERFORMER OR EVEN REQUIRE THAT THEIR PATIENTS ARE ENROLLED IN HOSPICE OR PALLIATIVE CARE BUT THEY REPORT THAT THEIR LOCAL HOSPICES ARE UNWILLING OR AND EQUIPPED TO HANDLE THE REQUEST. IN ADDITION THERE CHALLENGES IN TERMS OF PAYMENT MODELS AND UNDERSTANDING HOW TO DIVIDE UP THE THE LABOR OF CARING FOR PEOPLE. WHEN BOTH HOSPICE AND THE PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS ARE STILL INVOLVED. PATIENTS ARE MOST SUPPORTED IF THESE COORDINATION EFFORTS ARE IMPROVED. SO IN SOME REGARDLESS OF THE HEALTH SYSTEM WERE INDIVIDUAL PROVIDERS OWN POSITION TOWARD THE LA. FROM THIS RESEARCH I BELIEVE THE INFORMATION SHARING AND SUPPORT FOR COORDINATION WOULD REALLY IMPROVE. THAT EXPERIENCE OF PATIENTS WHO ARE ARE ALREADY PURSUING THIS OPTION AS WELL AS PATIENTS WHO WOULD NEVER PURSUED THE AID IN DYING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANKS. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MEAL LINGER ON THE GENERAL INTERNIST YOU SILLY IN A DIRECT THE ETHICS CENTER THERE. I'M HERE TO PRESENT ABOUT HOW YOU SEE LA HAS IMPLEMENTED BY THE END OF LIFE OPTION ACT. BOB THE SYSTEM CONVENE TO DIVERSE ONE LARGE WORK GROUP REPRESENTING ALL ASPECTS OF THE SYSTEM. BUT IN ORDER TO DEVELOP A POLICY ON HOW BEST TO IMPLEMENT THE ACT BOMB. THEY BEGAN WITH A SURVEY OF PRACTICING POSITIONS THAT INFORMED THE WORKGROUP DECISIONS. BOB AND THE WORK GROUP SUGGESTED THAT A SYSTEM BE DEVELOPED TO CREATE AN INFRASTRUCTURE. TO ENSURE THAT THE ACT REGULATIONS ROTH FOLLOWED. BOND THAT PATIENTS MAKE FULLY AUTONOMOUS COMPLETELY UNENCUMBERED CHOICES AND THAT THE END OF LIFE TREATMENT OVERALL IS THE BEST POSSIBLE CARE. THAT THESE PATIENTS COULD YET. I IN ORDER TO ATTAIN THESE OUTCOMES THE SYSTEM DIVERSE. DECIDED THAT THEY NEEDED TO SPECIALLY TRAINED SOCIAL WORKERS AND PSYCHOLOGISTS AND THEY CALL THEMSELVES CLINICAL CONSULTANTS. AND THEY'RE MANDATED TO WORK WITH EACH PATIENT WHO REQUESTS A AID IN DYING. AND TO CARRY OUT CYCLE OF. ASSESSMENTS COUNSELING CYCLE EDUCATION AN INTERDISCIPLINARY COMMUNICATION. I'M THE A WRITTEN THEY DEVELOPED ORIGINAL MATERIALS. AND THEY USE THESE TO PROMOTE CON. CONVERSATIONS ABOUT MEANING ABOUT LEGACY. OTHER CRITICAL CONSULTANTS ADDRESS PSYCHO SOCIAL DISTRESS IN PATIENTS AND FAMILIES. BY THE IS A THE ASSISTANT AND OF LIFE PLANNING. ARE THEY MAKE SOME EARLIER REFERRALS TO HOSPICE AND PALLIATIVE CARE AT TIMES. AND THEY ADDRESS THE CHALLENGES SUCH AS MANAGING PATIENT EXPECTATIONS. HOW ABOUT WHAT THE END OF LIFE OPTION ACT I MIGHT BE ABLE TO AFFORD THEM? BUT THE TIMING INVOLVED AND THE ASSIST ONE CONTINUITY POSITIONS CAN DECIDE NOT TO PRESCRIBE. BUT THEY WORK REALLY CLOSELY TO TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE AND SUPPORT TO THE PARTICIPATING POSSESSIONS. BUT THE WORKGROUP CRAFTED A POLICY GUIDING THEM IMPLEMENTATION THAT INCORPORATES THE VALUES OF THE HEALTH SYSTEM AND ALL POINT OUT A COUPLE. HARM OF HOW THESE VALUES TURN INTO IMPLEMENTATION APTS. BUT RECOGNIZING THAT MULTIPLE PHYSICIANS FREQUENTLY SHARE RESPONSIBILITY TO CARE FOR TERMINALLY ILL PATIENT. BOB CONTRARY TO THE CONCEPTUAL STATION WITHIN THE ACT ITSELF USUALLY REQUIRES THE ATTENDING PHYSICIAN WHO PRESCRIBES THE AID IN DYING DRUG. FOLLOW THE PATIENT IN CONTINUITY BUT RECOGNIZES THAT SHE OR HE MAY NOT BE THE ONLY PHYSICIAN WITH ONGOING RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE TREATMENT OF THE PATIENTS TERMINAL CONDITION. BOB RECOGNIZING THAT PATIENT EDUCATION IS ESSENTIAL FOR INFORMED DECISION MAKING ABOUT END OF LIFE CARE THE POLICY DICTATES THAT ALL REASONABLE TREATMENT OPTION SHOULD BE PRESENTED. BUT THAT POSITIONS MUST AVOID PRESSURE OR UNINTENDED PROMOTION OF AID IN DYING. AND ALSO AVOID ENGENDERING OR AGGRAVATING CONCERNS. THAT A PATIENT POSES A BURDEN ON OTHERS. BUT IF A PATIENT WITH TERMINAL ILLNESS REQUEST AID IN DYING DRUG BECAUSE OF SUFFERING THAT'S CONTRIBUTED TO BY LACK OF ACCESS TO MEDICAL CARE OR SOME OTHER EXTERNAL INFLUENCES. THOSE FACTORS THOSE FACTORS HAVE TO BE EXPLORED. BEFORE ONE CAN PROVIDE. THE AID IN DYING MEDICATION. BOB IF A IF OF POSITION IN A POSITION MAY NEVER ABANDON A PATIENT FOR MAKING AN AID IN DYING REQUEST. BOB RESPECTING THE INDIVIDUAL VIEWS OF CLINICIANS ON THE MANY TEAMS THAT CARE FOR HOSPITALIZED PATIENTS ADMINISTERING AND INGESTING MADE IN DYING DRUGS ISN'T PERMITTED. IN THE INPATIENT SETTING. BOB AND POSITIONS MUST COMPLETE A POST AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. WHICH ISN'T ALWAYS WHEN THE REQUEST IS MADE. BOB FOR A PATIENT INTENDING TO INGEST THE AND DOCTRINES. ARE THE POLICY WAS IMPLEMENTED BY BLANKETING THE HEALTH SYSTEM OF THE POSITIONS THE STAFF WITH EDUCATION MENTAL HEALTH SPECIALISTS WERE WILLING TO PERFORM THE HEALTH EDUCATION. BUT WOULD TIP TO PERFORM CONSULTATION SELF EDUCATED THEMSELVES AND PRACTICED ON EXAMPLE CASES. BY THE HEALTH SYSTEM PHARMACY COMPOUNDED. AND AFFORDABLE AID IN DYING DRUG ACTUALLY CONSIDERABLY CHEAPER THAN WE HEARD ABOUT THIS MORNING. THAT. IS BASED ON THE EXPERIENCE IN WASHINGTON AND OREGON THEY DEVELOP EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS AND ALSO ARRANGED A MECHANISM TO RETAIN THE PRESCRIPTIONS AT THE PHARMACY UNTIL THE REQUIRED. SO THAT THIS MINIMIZES THE COMMUNITY STORAGE OR DISPOSAL OF OF THE DRUGS. UP OVER THE FIRST EIGHTEEN MONTHS WE'VE HAD NEARLY A HUNDRED AND FIFTY PATIENTS MAKE REQUESTS. ARE MORE FEMALES THAN MALES ARE ALMOST ALL WHITE I MEAN AGE SIXTY SEVEN I EIGHTY SEVEN PERCENT WITH CANCER. THE PATIENCE OF FEW OF WHOM WANTED TO DIE BUT ENTHUSIASTICALLY PARTICIPATED IN COUNSELING INDIVIDUAL FAMILY CYCLE EDUCATION. LEGACY BUILDING SOME WELCOME TO NEW REFERRALS TO PALLIATIVE CARE HOSPICE CARE. OF THAT GROUP SEVENTEEN PERCENT MORE INTELLIGIBLE. A THIRTY SEVEN PERCENT DIDN'T COMPLETE THE PROCESS SO SOME NO LONGER PERCEIVED A NEED. BY OTHERS HAD DISEASE PROGRESSION SOME BECAME INCAPABLE. THEN THIRTY EIGHT PERCENT WERE PRESCRIBED AID IN DYING DRUG I EIGHT PERCENT ARE STILL GOING THROUGH THE PROCESS. A AMONG THE PATIENTS PRESCRIBE THE DRUG LITTLE OVER HALF AND JUST TO THE MEDICATION DYING. ALL COMFORTABLY. I SEVEN PATIENTS HAVE PRESCRIPTIONS WAITING AT THE PHARMACY RIGHT NOW. BY MORE THAN FIFTY POSITIONS HAVE PARTICIPATED IN THE PROCESS. SO CONCLUSION IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ACT THAT'S INCREASE THE PROMINENCE OF CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE END ABOUT END OF LIFE ISSUES AT OUR IN OUR HEALTH SYSTEM. BUT SOME OF THE EFFECTS ACROSS THE STATE. OF WOULD BE BETTER KNOWN IF WE HAD MORE DATA. I'D ADDITIONAL DATA BOTH BEING COLLECTED IN BETTER TRANSPARENCY OF THOSE DATA THAT ARE COLLECTED. BICU SILLY MECHANISM OF IMPLEMENTING THIS I THINK DEMONSTRATES THAT THERE'S MUCH UNMET NEED FOR EXPERT HANDS ON SUPPORT. AT THE END OF LIFE FOR WHICH RESOURCES ARE NEEDED AS YOU CAN TELL THE AMOUNT OF RESOURCES THAT NEEDS. TO GO INTO A PROCESS OF THIS SORT. HIS CREW IS CONSIDERABLE. BUT PERHAPS MOST IMPORTANTLY THIS LEVEL OF SUPPORT SHOULD NOT BE EXCLUSIVELY AVAIL AVAILABLE TO PEOPLE REQUESTING A DYING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIRMAN THANK YOU FOR READING. MY NAME IS MELISSA STERN. I AM THE MANAGING DIRECTOR FOR THE PERMANENTE MEDICAL GROUP AND NORTHERN CALIFORNIA FOR SUPPORTIVE CARE SERVICES WHICH PRESSES PALLIATIVE CARE AND ADVANCE CARE PLANNING AS WELL AS. I HAVE OVERSIGHT FOR THE DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR END OF LIFE OPTION PROGRAM. AND I REPRESENTED A GROUP OF PEOPLE COMMITTEE PEOPLE WHOSE WORK BEGAN IMMEDIATELY AFTER GOVERNOR BROWN SIGNED THE LINE TO. ACT AND WE CONVENED MUCH AS I'M A COLLEAGUES DEAD A BROAD GROUP OF STAKEHOLDERS FROM ACROSS THE ORGANIZATION AS YOU MIGHT IMAGINE. TO DESIGN AND IMPLEMENT A PROGRAM THAT WE THOUGHT WOULD BE AS COMPREHENSIVE THOUGHTFUL AND PATIENT CENTERED AS POSSIBLE. AND NOT INCLUDED MANY OF THE SAME FOLKS ONCOLOGY PRIMARY CARE MEDICINE AS WELL AS MEDICAL ETHICS ATTORNEYS PHARMACY BENEFITS AND THE LIKE TO CREATE BOTH A POLICY AS WELL AS PROPHECIES AND PROGRAMS TO SUPPORT THE IMPLEMENTATION. ARE. OUR COMMITTEE SAID AS OUR NORTHSTAR AND IDEA THAT NO PATIENT WHATEVER AVAIL THEMSELVES OF THIS LAW FOR LACK OF ACCESS TO HIGH QUALITY PALLIATIVE CARE HOSPICE SERVICES. AND AS WE WENT ABOUT OUR DESIGN THIS WAS THE THING WE REMINDED OURSELVES UP AND ASKED ALL ALONG IF WHAT WE WERE SETTING FORTH WOULD SERVE BACK GOAL. AND I THINK WHAT WE'RE MOST PROUD OF TODAY IS THAT TIME WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO HONOR THAT ASPIRATION SO LIKE. LIKE UC DAVIS MENTIONED. NINETY NINE PERCENT OF OUR MEMBERS WHO'VE WHO'VE GONE THROUGH THE END OF LIFE OPTION PROGRAM AT KAISER HAVE. EITHER BEEN TREATED BY SPECIALTY PALETTE OF CARE TEAMS HAVE BEEN ENROLLED IN HOSPICE PROGRAMS OR BOTH. AND WE FIND THAT TO BE VERY IMPORTANT. I'M. WHEN WE BEGAN WE ENDEAVOR TO LEARN AS MUCH ABOUT THE LAW AS POSSIBLE AND AS EARLIER SPEAKERS SAID WE SET OUT TO LEARN FROM. OUR BECAUSE A PERMANENT A COLLEAGUES IN OREGON WHO HAD MORE THAN EIGHTEEN YEARS EXPERIENCE WITH THEIR DEATH WITH DIGNITY LAW. AND BASED ON THEIR ADVICE LIKE THE OTHER SYSTEMS WE CREATED A NEW POSITION WHICH WE CALLED THE END OF LIFE OPTION PATIENT CO ORDINATOR. AND SIMILARLY TO OTHER SYSTEMS THEIR ROLE AND RESPONSIBILITIES TO FOLD. TO ASSIST THE PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES NAVIGATE THIS MULTI STEP PROCESS THAT YOU SET OUT IN THE LONG. AND LIKE OTHERS THIS INCLUDES ASSISTING PATIENTS WHEN THEIR OWN PHYSICIANS OPT OUT OF PARTICIPATION TO IDENTIFY OTHERS WHO WILL SUPPORT THEM. AND THEY ALSO SUPPORT THE PARTICIPATING PHYSICIANS SO THAT THOSE POSITIONS ARE WELL PREPARED TO. FOLLOWED THE SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS OF THE LAW TO AVAIL THEMSELVES OF DOCUMENTATION TEMPLATES AND THE LIKE. AND WHAT WE HAVE FOUND IS THAT OUR MEMBERS THEIR FAMILIES AND OUR PHYSICIANS ARE WILDLY. APPRECIATIVE OF THE SUPPORT THAT THEY GET FROM THOSE COORDINATORS AND THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO WHOSE FULL TIME JOB IT IS TO DO THIS WORK. IN OUR DESIGN WE ALSO SOUGHT THE ADVICE OF PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES WHO WERE INTERESTED IN THIS WORK. AND WE WANTED TO LEARN WHAT WOULD BE IMPORTANT OF THEM AND I I SEE THAT DANTE HAS HAS BEEN IN THE ROOM AND I WON IT KNOWLEDGE THAT. HE SPENT SOMETIME WITH US GIVING US THAT'S THAT SENSE OF WHAT WOULD BE IMPORTANT. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE CREATED. IN RESPONSE TO WHAT WE HEARD AS THE IS A PROGRAM GUIDE I'VE BROUGHT COPIES THAT I CAN MAKE AVAILABLE TO ALL OF YOU. AND THE PURPOSE OF THE GUIDE US TO DO SOME OF THE EDUCATION THAT WASN'T MENTIONED BEING NECESSARY. IT PROVIDES ANSWERS TO FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS IT OVER VIEWS THE PROCESS NOT JUST THE STEPS THAT ARE OUTLINED IN THE LAW BUT ACTUALLY ALL THAT IS REQUIRED TO GO FROM AN INITIAL INQUIRY TO HAVING A PRESCRIPTION AT YOUR. AT YOUR HOME. AND REALLY DETAILS WHAT IT WHAT CAN BE EXPECTED EACH STEP ALONG THE WAY. THE OTHER THING AS OTHERS DID TO OVERSEE AND TO DEVELOP THE PROGRAM ONGOING WE CREATED A GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE FOR US THAT INCLUDES. MEDICAL DIRECTORS AND ADMINISTRATIVE LEADERS BOTH AT A REGIONAL LEVEL AS WELL AT EACH HAVE OUR MEDICAL CENTERS AND THOSE ARE PARTNERED WITH PHYSICIAN MENTORS. WHO HAD FORMALLY? AGREED TO SERVE IN A MENTORSHIP ROLE TO GET MORE EDUCATION SO THAT THEY CAN SUPPORT OTHERS WHO MAY. HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT WHETHER TO PARTICIPATE THAT WAS MENTIONED SOME PEOPLE MAY PARTICIPATE THEY'RE NOT SURE AND THE MENTORS CONSERVANCY PORT OF THOSE PEOPLE. THAT STRUCTURE ALLOWS US. THE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR AN ONGOING. PROGRAM OF PROCESS IMPROVEMENT AND AS OTHERS MENTIONED WE CONSISTENTLY REVIEW OUR CASES TO IDENTIFY AND ADDRESS OPERATIONAL CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR IMPROVEMENT. IMPORTANTLY WE ALSO REGULARLY CONDUCT I'M DE BRIEFS WHERE PHYSICIANS AND STAFF WHO ARE INVOLVED IN A PATIENT'S CARE. CN DISCUSS THE EMOTIONAL IMPACT ON THE CASE FOR THEM AND TO GIVE AND RECEIVE SUPPORT TO ONE ANOTHER. I'M THIS IS ALSO OFTEN INCORPORATED INTO THE SCHWARTZ ROUNDS THAT MANY OF OUR MEDICAL CENTERS DO. AND. FINALLY I WANNA SAY AS OTHERS HAVE THAT I'VE SEEN VERY POSITIVE RIPPLE A FAX FROM THE LAW TO THE BROADER ISSUES OF END OF LIFE HEALTH CARE. AND CALIFORNIANS CERTAINLY KAISER PERMANENTE A. I THINK IT MASON NATHAN MENTIONED THE MEDIA ATTENTION FROM THE PASSAGE AND ENACTMENT OF THE LAW REALLY BROUGHT THIS TO THE FORE AND. IN MY WORK ESPECIALLY IN ADVANCE CARE PLANNING WORK WE SAW MORE MEMBERS COMING FORWARD AND ASKING IF THEY COULD HAVE ADVANCE CARE PLANNING CONVERSATIONS PEOPLE WHO WERE GAINING MORE CLARITY ON THEIR OWN VALUES AND BELIEFS FOR AND OF LIFE THERE. AND THEY WANTED TO MAKE THAT KNOWN TO US. THAT THE SECOND HOW TO DO ALSO WITH A PHYSICIAN AND PROVIDER EDUCATION. JUST AS NAY. PERTINENT ENOUGH FOR PEOPLE TO RECOGNIZE THAT THEY NEEDED SOME SOME ADDITIONAL EDUCATION AND TO BEAT HIM TO REACH OUT FOR IT. WE PROVIDED BOTH DIDACTIC EDUCATION AND. COMMUNICATION SKILLS EDUCATION WE DEVELOPED AN EIGHT HOUR. COMMUNICATION PROCESS AND AND TRAINING WITH VITAL TALK WHO ARE KNOWN NATIONALLY AS EXPERTS IN PHYSICIAN COMMUNICATION AROUND SERIOUS ILLNESS. AND BOTH IN THE DIDACTIC SESSIONS AS WELL AS IN THE COMMUNICATION WORKSHOPS WE HAD. RECORD NUMBERS OF PHYSICIANS ATTENDING AND SOLD OUT. KIND OF ATTENDANCE SO WE WE FIND THAT QUITE ENCOURAGING AND SO I WOULD SAY THAT FROM MY PERSPECTIVE. THE THOSE REBEL A FAX OF THE LAW HAVE HAVE BEEN VERY VERY POSITIVE GENERALLY SPEAKING FOR. FOR CALIFORNIANS TO HAVE CARE AT THE END OF LIFE THAT THAT ALIGNS WITH THEIR OWN VALUES AND BELIEFS WHICH IS. OUR PRIORITY. LOOKING. THANK YOU NAY AND AGAIN I THINK THAT'S WHAT ALL OF US WERE HOPING FOR WHEN WE PUT THIS INTO EFFECT THAT IT WOULD JUST INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF CONVERSATIONS. BOTH INDIVIDUALS AND PROVIDERS WITH I OR HAVING TALKING ABOUT END OF LIFE. UNTIL I HEARD PLAGUED THE DESIRE FOR MORE DATA WHAT WHAT KINDS OF MORE DATA AND AND HOW WOULD THAT AND IN THE TRANSPARENCY THAT CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE ABOUT THAT. SURE SO IN TERMS OF MORE DATA. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR US IS MORE DATA ABOUT THE RANGE OF. APPROACHES THAT THAT SYSTEMS ARE TAKING WHICH IS PART OF WHAT WE'RE DOING IN THIS MORE INFORMATION SHARING MORE INFORMATION SHARING IN ACROSS SYSTEMS. ACROSS DIFFERENT KINDS OF SETTINGS BUT I THINK DOCTOR WHEN THERE WAS TALKING SPECIFICALLY ABOUT MORE PATIENT. RIGHT SO THEY'RE I THINK THERE'S TWO AREAS WHERE MORE DATA COULD BE HELPFUL FIRST OF ALL THEIR DATA BEING COLLECTED PROPPING RELEASED. THOSE DATA ESPECIALLY WE HEARD THIS MORNING THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE DESTROYED AFTER THREE YEARS. I'D BE REALLY GREAT TO GET ALL THOSE DATA PUBLISHED. BUT IN ADDITION WE'RE NOT HEARING ABOUT REQUESTS. FOR THE FIRST AID IN DYING ACT AND ALL WE KNOW ABOUT OUR PRESCRIPTIONS WRITTEN. THERE OUGHT TO BE A WAY FOR US TO COLLECT DATA SIMILAR TO WHAT I PRESENTED TO YOU HERE. BOB THAT IS MORE BROADLY REPRESENTATIVE OF WHAT'S HAPPENING WITHIN THE STATE BOMB. AND THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND WHERE THERE ARE AREAS WHERE PERHAPS ACCESS IS IS COMPROMISED. PETA MAY ACTUALLY LA WAS TO UNDERSTAND MANY OTHER THINGS. SUCH AS AREAS WHERE MORE REQUESTS. OR BEING SEEN THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE BE EXPECTED. THANK YOU QUESTION THE HEARTENING BECAUSE AND END OF LIFE CONVERSATIONS AMONG FAMILIES. WITH PROVIDERS. INTO ACCESS OF FULL RANGE OF END OF LIFE OPTIONS AND. YOUR MACHINE INDIVIDUAL ON SHARE TESTIMONY REALLY CONFIRMS THAT. NOW I HAD IT QUESTION FOR DOCTOR FAMINE IN MAYBE FOR THE OTHER INSTITUTIONS. IT SEEMS LIKE THE UC MED CENTER SIR RELATIVELY AUTONOMOUS AND WANTING IF THERE'S. ARE THEIR ANY MECHANISMS WITHIN THE UC MEDICAL DO RESIDENTS ANY TRAINING IN THEIR RESIDENCY TRAINING AT. UC DAVIS MEANT CENTER. YEAH I'LL TAKE THE SECOND A QUESTION FIRST AT YOU SEE DO YOU THE AUTONOMY OF EACH OF THE UC HOSPITALS EACH OF US. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT EACH INSTITUTION MADE AND WHICH ARE INCLUDING ONES LIKE THIS IN WHICH. PROVIDERS ARE WITH AN INSTITUTIONAL PERSPECTIVE. FROM DR WENGER FROM MELISSA ABOUT THE THE UCLA EXPERIENCE IN THE KAISER EXPERIENCE WE MAY HEAR ACTUALLY. FROM. COLLABORATOR LEVEL LEVEL DOCTOR KOENIG I THINK IS ON THE. ON THE SCHEDULE CORRECT THANK YOU IN THE ENTRY. CAN YOU OFFER AN ESTIMATE OF HOW MANY. YOU WOULD DESCRIBE AS PARTICIPATING. PHYSICIANS UC DAVIS ON HOW MANY PARTICIPATING PHYSICIANS ARE WE HAD ABOUT. AT THIS POINT AND SO THAT'S VERY LOW RATES OF PARTICIPATION AMONG CANCER PROVIDERS. IN THE ROLE OF THE PARTICIPANT WE HAD ABOUT THIRTY DIFFERENT DOCTORS AND. THERE'S SO MUCH. MORE DIVERSITY IN TERMS OF PROFESSIONAL BACKGROUND THAT'S REPRESENTED IN THAT GROUP. AND WE'VE HAD ABOUT SIX DIFFERENT PSYCHIATRISTS WHO PROVIDED. THE MENTAL HEALTH SPECIALIST ASSESSMENT. THE YOU AND. I HEARD APPROXIMATELY FIFTY PHYSICIANS AT UCLA SENT. HAVE PARTICIPATED NAM AYE THANK YOU SHARED THE NUMBER FIFTY. THAT WOULD DEFINITELY BE A LOWER FOUND NO HAN YET THING SAID MORE FIFTY OR MORE. LINLINK KAISER NORTHERN CALIFORNIA'S THAT YEAR LATELY WITH MY DAILY WAY CAN ACTUALLY I DON'T HAVE THE NUMBERS FOR YOU BUT WHAT I WILL SAY IS THAT WHEN PHYSICIANS MAKE A REFERRAL TO THE PROGRAM. WE ASK THEM IN WHAT WAY ARE THEY WILLING TO PARTICIPATE ARE THEY WILLING TO BE AN ATTENDING PHYSICIAN AT A CONSULTING PHYSICIAN EITHER DO THEY WOULD THEY BE WILLING TO PARTICIPATE WITH MENTORSHIP. AND WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF PHYSICIANS ARE WILLING TO PARTICIPATE IN SOME FASHION. IN IN THOSE VARIOUS AREAS I DON'T HAVE THE NUMBERS THINK YOU. IN ONE OF THE CHALLENGES I THINK WE HAVE IS THAT. YOU'RE ALL REPRESENTING PARTICIPATING INSTITUTIONS. AND AS WE ALL UNDERSTAND THE LAW ALLOWS AN INSTITUTION TO OPT OUT. IT DOESN'T REQUIRE ANY POSITION TO PARTICIPATE WHO DOESN'T WANT TO. SOME INSTITUTIONS BECAUSE OF CORE BELIEFS. NAME NOT BE INCLINED TO HELP A PATIENT. FIND A. A PHYSICIAN WHO WOULD BE ABLE TO. FACILITATE THAT NARROW THE SCOPE OF OUR HEARING TODAY BUT IT IS. A BROADER QUESTION OF ACCESS. IN I THINK I'M. IN IN THE SHARING OF INFORMATION AMONG INSTITUTIONS ó I THINK DOCTOR WHEN YOU RAISE THE ISSUE. OF SOME RETICENCE OF PARTICIPATING POSITIONS TO BE LISTED IN SOME KIND OF A REPOSITORY. I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THOSE OF US THEY'RE TRYING TO MOVE FORWARD WITH IMPLEMENTATION. WE HAVE TRIED TO FIGURE OUT HOW COULD YOU CREATE. A RIPS OPOSITORES IF OF NAMES THAT MAYBE HAS SOME PROTECTIONS FOR CONFIDENTIALITY OR SOME GATEWAYS ON HAVE YOU GIVEN ANY FURTHER THOUGHT ANY OF YOU TO. NO INFORMATION ABOUT. PARTICIPATING PHYSICIANS MIGHT BEACH MIGHT BE SHARED OR MADE AVAILABLE TO PATIENTS OR OTHER POSITIONS. WITHOUT COMPROMISING A DESIRE FOR CONFIDENTIALITY. I MIGHT. I MIGHT POINT OUT THAT DATES PROBABLY DIFFERENT WITHIN SYSTEMS THEN. OUTSIDE OF SYSTEMS. I WITHIN SYSTEMS WE'RE SEEING AND VERY INTERESTING. APPROACH. DEVELOPMENT OVERTIME WHERE I'M NOT MANY PEOPLE MIGHT THINK THAT THE OPPOSITION DECISION TO PARTICIPATE ARE UP NOW PARTICIPATE. IS SOMETHING THAT IS A STRONGLY HELD BELIEF FOR SOME IT IS. BUT FOR THE VAST MAJORITY WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS THAT IT'S DEPENDENTLARGELY ON THE PHYSICIAN PATIENT RELATIONSIP. AND THAT POSITIONS ARE WILLING TO PRESCRIBE UNDER SOME CIRCUMSTANCES BUT NOT UNDER OTHERS. AND IN FACT WITHIN A SYSTEM WHERE THERE IS COMFORT IN THEIR SUPPORT WE'RE SEEING MORE AND MORE PHYSICIANS BEING WILLING TO PRESCRIBE PERHAPS NOT AT THE VERY BEGINNING. AND NOW EIGHTEEN MONTHS AND THEY ARE. BOB AND WE'RE ALSO SEEING THAT THEY'RE COORDINATING AMONG THEMSELVES WITHIN THEIR SPECIALTY. SO FOR INSTANCE MANY OF OUR OWN ONCOLOGISTS ARE PRESCRIBING NOW THEY WEREN'T ORIGINALLY. AND THEY. HAVE ARRANGED TO BE ABLE TO CONSULT FOR EACH OTHER TO MAKE SURE THAT PATIENTS ARE ARE ABLE TO RECEIVE THAT THE. THE AND OF LIFE OPTION ACT. IF IN FACT IT'S APPROPRIATE. IN. IT EVOLVED DESCRIBED INSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURES THAT PROVIDE SUPPORT IN MULTI DISCIPLINARY COOPERATION IN. CLEARLY A PHYSICIAN WHO'S MAYBE. IN A SMALLER PRACTICE IN THE MORE REMOTE AREA AND DOESN'T HAVE THE RESOURCES. IS GONNA BE MORE RELUCTANT OR SOMEBODY WITHIN YOUR SYSTEMS IS GONNA HAVE THAT THAT SUPPORT NETWORK AVAILABLE TO THEM. MANAGERS TO FINAL QUESTION. THE DATA SHOWS MOST OF THE PEOPLE ACCESSING. IN THE EARLY STAGES OF IMPLEMENTATION. HAVE BEEN QUITE SOME OF SUGGESTED ANECDOTALLY. HIGHLY EDUCATED. GOOD SELF ADVOCATES SATURATE CENTER. NAM. ANY THOUGHTS ON HOW WE CAN BETTER ENGAGE. THOSE SERVING UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS MAYBE NON ENGLISH SPEAKING POPULATIONS AGAIN NOT TO. PROSELYTIZE THE YOU SERVE BUT MAKING SURE EQUAL ACCESS FOR THOSE. WHO WOULD BE A CANDIDATE? COULD ALSO HAVE EQUAL ACCESS. IN MAY THAT CENTER FOR QUESTION TO THIS PANEL THAT MAYBE MADAM CHAIR I THINK IT IS ONE OF OUR CHALLENGES OF HOW. OR WE HAVE DISPARITIES HAVE ACCESS ON MANY LEVELS. WE'RE ALSO GONNA DISPARITY OF ACCESS TO THIS FROM FORGIVE ME I I DON'T. I DON'T HAVE THE ANSWER THAT QUESTION BUT I WOULD JUST MAKE AN OBSERVATION THAT THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM THAT'S UNIQUE TO THE END OF LIFE OPTION ACT. THAT'S A IF YOU'VE DESCRIBED A PROBLEM WITH. THE WAY HOW CSUS ARE HEALTH SYSTEMS ARE ORGANIZED. AND. PARTICULARLY WITH RESPECT TO ACCESS TO TIE QUALITY PALETTE OF CARE. YEAH. I WOULD HAVE TUCKED CHAIRMAN THAT TIME I HAVE GONE TO A NUMBER OF. OF PLACES TO. SPEAK ABOUT HOW ONE WOULD IMPLEMENT. THE END OF LIFE OPTION OUT IN THESE ARE LARGELY. ABOUT COUNTY FUNDED FACILITIES. AND WHAT WHAT WE FIND IS THAT IF THERE ISN'T ADEQUATE PALLIATIVE CARE. THE DEMAND FOR THE END OF LIFE OPTION ACT IS NONEXISTENT. THAT IN FACT ONE NEEDS TO HAVE AN ADEQUATE PALLIATIVE STRUCTURE. TO EVEN CONSIDER AS AN INSTITUTION OR IS A SYSTEM. PUTTING RESOURCES. AND TO AID IN DYING. THANK YOU AND FOUND QUESTION FROM DOT QUIRK. YES I JUST WANT TO THANK STANFORD UC SAN DIEGO UC DAVIS UCLA AND KAISER NORTH. FOR THEIR CAREFUL INCONSIDERATE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE LAW THANK YOU. YEAH AND I WOULD I WOULD SAY WE DID REACH OUT TO INVITE SYSTEM TO WHO WERE NOT PARTICIPATING. DISTURBED AND WE HEAR THEIR PERSPECTIVE IN HERE. BUT THEY FOR WHATEVER REASON HAVE TO DECLINE. BUT WE THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH BECAUSE CLEARLY YOU HAVE. BEEN INCREDIBLY THOUGHTFUL INTENTIONAL IN IN THIS IMPLEMENTATION AND I AND I THINK WHAT YOU FIND HOME. DR MISTER MINDS QUESTION IS IS IT CONSISTENT WITH WHAT WE SEE IN HEALTH CARE A WE WE NEED BETTER MORE. ROBUST HEALTH CARE ESPECIALLY AROUND PALETTE OF ISSUES AND END OF LIFE. BUT THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH IT AND GUYS DOES EVERYBODY HAVE WRITTEN. DOCUMENTS THAT YOU GOT YOUR PATIENTS NOT ASSERTED THAT YOU BROUGHT FOR US. WE ARE GOING TO PLAY OUT THE PATH. JUST WOULD LIKE TO SEE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR FOR YOUR WORK AND WE KNOW IT'S NOT EASY IMPLEMENTING BRAND NEW LAWS LIKE THIS AND AND WE PASSED THEM IN YOU EMPLOYMENT AND SO WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR. FOR ALL YOUR WORK. A A NEXT UP THE HOSPICE EXPERIENCE GOOD MORNING AND WELCOME MORE AND MORE IN A FEW HEIGHT AS WE HAVE FLAT ILANA. THAT TO LOCK IT TAKES ABOUT FIFTEEN DAY OKAY I CAN'T THINK YOU THE OLDER THAT YOU SAY IT EVERY TIME THEN. SEASON HEALTHCARE OF MANAGEMENT WE HAVE MK NELSON DIRECTOR SPIRITUAL CARROT MISSION HOSPICE AND LIZ SUMNER TRIAGE MANAGER AT ELIZABETH HOSPICE. WELL GOOD MORNING EVERY MORNING. AND I'M WILLING TO SETTLE OF SKI AS YOU MENTIONED I'M WITH SEASONS HEALTH CARE MANAGEMENT WE ARE THE UMBRELLA ORGANIZATION FOR SEASONS HOSPICE AND PALLIATIVE CARE. WE OPERATE IN NINETEEN STATES THREE OF WHICH CURRENTLY HAVE AN END OF LIFE OPTIONS ACTOR DEATH WITH DIGNITY ALONG PLACE. SIX OF THOSE SITES ARE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. I'M GONNA TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUTHOW WE STARTED IMPLEMENTING. FOR OUR OWN STAFF SO LOOKING AT WHAT DID WE DO AROUND PROTOCOLS WHICH WE DID DEVELOP. A WHAT DID WE DO AROUND EDUCATION AND SUPPORT OF THE STAFF AND THEN SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE ARE FINDING OURSELVES FACED WITH ON A DAY TO DAY BASIS AND ALSO INCREASING. SO ONE OF THE THINGS I THINK IS REALLY ON IMPERATIVE TALK ALL OF THE WORK THAT WE'RE ALL DOING IS. AND FOR US IS WE USE THAT IDEA OF PATIENT EXPERIENCE IT'S EVEN IN MY OWN TITLE AS THE DEPARTMENT THAT OVERSEES. ALL THE PSYCHOSOCIAL DISCIPLINES UP QUALITY AND EDUCATION AT OUR SITE AFFECTS. AND SO ONE OF THE THINGS WE DID ONCE THE. ACT WAS PASSED BEFORE THE IMPLEMENTATION WE ACTUALLY. UPDATED PROTOCOLS WE DO HAVE IT SITES IN OREGON SO WE UPDATED PROTOCOLS. SURROUNDING THAT ACT AND AND CALLED PHYSICIAN AID IN DYING. AND REALLY THERE ARE A FEW THINGS THAT WE THINK ARE KIND OF UNIQUE TO THE WAY THAT WE DID THIS PROTOCOL SO ONE OF THEM IS. AT EVERY PATIENT REQUEST I'M SIMILAR TO WHAT DOCTOR FUHRMAN WAS TALKING ABOUT HAVING A PATIENT ADVOCATE I'M THAT INDIVIDUAL FOR THE CALIFORNIA SITES ARE NATIONAL DIRECTORS OF SUPPORTIVE CARE PATIENT EXPERIENCE. AND OUR REGIONAL TEAMS ARE WELL VERSED IN THE LAW AND PROVIDING THAT EDUCATION ON A REGULAR BASIS. I'M OUR PHYSICIANS DO HAVE THE OPTION TO PARTICIPATE AS THE ATTENDING AS DEFINED BY THE ACT. AND THEY CAN ALSO PARTICIPATE AS CONSULTING THEY THEY MAY CHOOSE TO OPT OUT BUT IT IS WRITTEN INTO OUR PROTOCOL THAT THEY MAY PARTICIPATE. I STAFF MAY BE PRESENT AT THE TIME OF INGESTION WHICH I THINK FOR SOME SITES IS RATHER UNIQUE AS LONG AS WE HAVE TO STAFF MEMBERS PRESENT AND. PART OF THE THEORY BEHIND THAT WAS. COURSE THE LEGAL ASPECTS SURROUNDING IT BUT ALSO THE IDEA AROUND THAN BEING ABLE TO DIVIDE AND CONQUER SO PATIENTS FAMILY POTENTIALLY EACH OTHER OR OTHER. HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS THAT WE ARE COLLABORATING WITH. THEN WE LOOKED AT REALLY THE ROLLOUT IN EDUCATION AND WE STARTED THAT AGAIN IN ADVANCE OF THE. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ACT AND THE INITIAL I ROLLED OUT TO THAT WE DID WAS A LIVE WEAPON ARE WHICH WE RECORDED I'VE HAD A. EXTENSIVE Q. AND A SESSION. WHICH IN IN A FACTOR THEN CAME BACK TO SOME UPDATES ON OUR PROTOCOL TO REALLY EXPLAIN TO THE STAFF SOME OF THE. ASPECTS THAT THEY HIDE IN ORDER TO MOVE FORWARD. WE REALLY WANTED TO ENCOURAGE AND EMPOWER OUR STAFF MEMBERS TO REFLECT ON THEIR OWN BELIEF SYSTEMS. AND CHIU STYLE. AS THEY RELATE TO THE LAW INVITING THEM TO SHARE THEIR WILLINGNESS TO PARTICIPATE OR THEIR CONVICTION NOT TO WITH THEIR THEIR IMMEDIATE LEADERSHIP TEAMS. AS A RESULT OF THAT WE'VE ALSO AMENDED ARE ON CALL STRUCTURE FOR BOTH AND WHICH INCLUDES ALL OF ART DISCIPLINES I'M NURSING. MEDICAL ARE ADMINISTRATORS ON CALL AND I DON'T LAWLER PSYCHOSOCIAL DISCIPLINES. IN TERMS OF REALLY SUPPORTING BOTH THE PATIENT CHOICE AND THE STUFF CHOICE AND DECISION. AS WE HAVE LEARNED MORE AND WE HAVE DONE LIVE. LIVE EDUCATION STRUCTURES EVERY TWO MONTHS FOR EVERYONE OF THOSE SIX CALIFORNIA SITES AND WE'VE TAKEN VARIED. CREATIVE APPROACHES AROUND HOW DO THESE TRAINING SO SOME OF THE MOST RECENT ONES INCLUDED SOME CASE STUDIES I'M FOCUSING ON THE IDF CHOICE CONTROL ON HOW TO HAVE THE CONVERSATION A FACILITATOR. BE THAT. THEY ARE THAT WITNESS AND BE OF THE SILENT OBSERVER OF THIS. AND WE DID SOME JEOPARDY GAMES WHICH IS ONGOING AMONG THE SITES AND SOME TRUE AND FALSE POP QUIZZES SOMETIMES I'LL JUST SHOW UP AT RANDOM AND AND ENGAGE IN THIS DISCUSSION DURING IDG. AND A LOT OF EXPERIENTIAL ROLE PLAYS AGAIN TO REALLY HELP THEM. I. BUT OR EMPLOYED THESE. TO REALLY HELP THEM ENGAGE IN FACILITATING A DISCUSSION THAT HONORS WHO THEY ARE AS THE CLINICIAN AS WELL. WE FEEL THAT THEY'RE REALLY MUCH BETTER EQUIPPED THAN THEY WERE WHEN WE FIRST STARTED THIS PROCESS WERE NOTICING MORE AND MORE OF OUR STAFF. WANTING TO PARTICIPATE AND BE PRESENT AND SOME WHO HAD. ORIGINALLY SAID THAT THEY DID NOT WANT TO PARTICIPATE AT ALL AND BE AT THE BEDSIDE WITH OUR PATIENTS AND FAMILIES. HAVE NOW BEGUN TO MAKE THE CHOICE TO BE PRESENT FOR CERTAIN PATIENTS AND FAMILIES. AND WE DO HAVE ABOUT FIFTY PERCENT OF OUR STAFF THAT IS AT THE BEDSIDE. WE'VE NOTICED AND THREE OF OUR SITES THAT. WE HAVE WHAT WE CALL A CHAMPION OF THIS PROGRAM LOCALLY. AND SO AT THREE OF THE SITES CURRENTLY THEY'RE TAKING INITIATIVES TO PROVIDE EDUCATION TO THE LARGER HEALTH SYSTEMS THAT WE WORK WITH. ON THE HOSPITALS THAT ARE PARTICIPATING THE AD ASSISTED LIVING FACILITIES THE SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES TO REALLY HELP FRAME THE IDEA OF PATIENT CHOICE. THEN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THESE ARE VERY EARLY NUMBERS BUT I'M ARE SIX CALIFORNIA PROGRAMS HAD AROUND TWO DOZEN REQUESTS. AND WE'VE HAD EIGHT COMPLETED AND TWO ARE SCHEDULED FOR THIS WEEK. AND LIKE OTHERS ARE CHALLENGES ARE VERY SIMILAR THERE ARE ABOUT FIVE. AND. THE ONE BIG ONE I THINK FOR ALL HOSPICE PROVIDERS IS THE THE LATE REFERRAL THAT WE RECEIVE. AND SO THAT'S THAT'S BEEN ONE BECAUSE NOT HAVING THAT TIME FRAME RELIEVED MAKES THIS VERY BURDENSOME AND UNLIKELY FOR SOME OF OUR PATIENTS PARTICIPATE. AND SOME HAVE BEEN DROPPED FROM THEIR PREVIOUS PROVIDERS. EVEN AFTER THEY WERE ELIGIBLE FOR THE BENEFIT AND SO THEY COME TO US AGAIN RATHER LATE. WE DO CONTINUE NOTICE. SLOWLY DECREASING FRED I'M CONCERNED FROM THE STOCK. AS WHERE WE REALLY STARTED RIGHT TO STOP THINKING OH MY GOSH I'M GOING TO MISS A STEP. AND WHAT DOES THAT MEAN TO WORKS MY OWN LICENSE BUT WE'RE NOTICING NOT DECREASING WITH THE MORE EDUCATION WE PROVIDE AND THE MORE TEACHING UP INSIDE THAT WE PROVIDE AND SUPPORT AT THAT SITE WE PROVIDE. HI I'M ONE OF THE RECENT EXPERIENCES THAT WERE HAVING MORE AND MORE INCREASED. AND HOW IT IS BEING REPORTED BY THE STAFF IS I'M THE VETERANS POPULATION. AND SO IN PROVIDING THAT INFORMED CONSENT TO THAT POPULATION AROUND THEIR BENEFITS. ON IF THEY HAVE THE SENSE OF QUOTE UNQUOTE AT OBJECTION AROUND THE WHAT IFS. AND SO SOME OF THEM ARE OPTING NOT TO IN THAT BUS BY ITS INCREASING SOME OF THEIR SUFFERING. AND THEN AT THE VERY FOREFRONT. WHICH MANY HAVE MENTIONED ALREADY IS THE IDEA OF THE POWER THE ABILITY FOR FACILITIES TOPPED OUT. AND SO HOW DO WE GET CREATIVE IN SUPPORTING OUR PATIENTS WHO ARE IN THE FACILITIES LIKE HOSPITALS OR THE ASSISTED LIVING FACILITIES ARE SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES WHERE THEY CURRENTLY RESIDE IN CALL HOME. AND HOW DO WE HELP THEM IF TRULY THEY ARE ELIGIBLE FOR THE ACT IN THIS IS REALLY THEIR LAST OPTION AND THE OPTION THAT THEY WANT TO CHOOSE. DESPITE THE CHALLENGES WE'RE GONNA KEEP GOING AND WILL WILL MOVE FORWARD AND. AT THAT REALLY KEEP OUR PATIENTS THEIR FAMILIES AT THE FOREFRONT OF THE CARE THAT WE PROVIDE I REALLY THINK THE ASSEMBLY FOR. PERMITTING US TO CONTINUE THIS DISCUSSION AND LEARN MORE FROM ONE ANOTHER. VERY MUCH. MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU AYE AYE ECHO YOUR APPRECIATION THAT THIS PROCESS OF COMING BACK TO THE TABLE EACH YEAR IS BUILT INTO WHAT'S HAPPENING AT THE ROOT OF IT HERE WHERE THE LAWS BEEN CREATED. I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT THE MORE WE CAN HAVE CONVERSATIONS AND HAVE DIFFERENT PEOPLE COME TO THE TABLE. THE MORE WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO FIT IN CAN CONTINUE TO IMPROVE THIS OPTION FOR OUR PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES. SO. MY NAME IS MK NELSON AND I AM DIRECTOR OF SPIRITUAL CARE ADMISSION HOSPICE AND HOME CARE WHERE IN SAN MATEO COUNTY. WE ARE AT A LOCAL HOSPICE THAT STARTED ABOUT THIRTY NINE YEARS AGO JUST FROM TWO OF THE OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS WHO. WANTED TO HAVE HOSPICE IN THEIR OWN COUNTY. WE'VE GROWN A LOT ESPECIALLY IN THE LAST TEN YEARS. I WOULD SAY THAT WE'VE BECOME MUCH LARGER THAN WE HAD BEEN ORIGINALLY WE HAVE AROUND TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY TO TWO HUNDRED FORTY PATIENTS THAT WE SERVE. SINCE THE LAW HAS PASSED. WE HAVE ACTUALLY SERVED OF ABOUT THIRTY SIX PATIENTS WHICH IS A MUCH HIGHER NUMBER THAN WE ANTICIPATED. EVEN WITH EXPECTING LOWER NUMBERS. WE BEFORE JUNE NINTH TWENTY SIXTEEN CAME WE REALLY WANTED TO BE PREPARED. WE KNEW THAT WE HAD A COUPLE OF DOCTORS WHO WOULD PROBABLY BE WILLING TO BE ATTENDING PHYSICIANS. AND WE ALSO JUST RECOGNIZE THAT THIS WAS A NEW HORIZON FOR END OF LIFE CARE I MYSELF I'VE DONE HOSPICE WORK FOR ABOUT TWELVE YEARS. AND IT HAS BEEN TRUE THAT EVEN FOLKS WHO ARE VETERANS IN THE HOSPICE WORLD THIS HAS BEEN. KIND OF A HUMBLING A NEW EXPERIENCE IT REALLY DOES TAKE IT TO THE TO THE NEXT LEVEL. BUT WE WHATEVER LEVEL THAT MAY BE. SO WE WANTED TO BE PREPARED. TO THAT END WE. HAD A SERIES OF BROWN BAG LUNCHES WITH OUR STAFF. INCLUDING ART MINISTRY TO STAFF IN OUR CLINICAL STAFF MAKING SURE THAT FOLKS HAD A CHANCE TO. EXPRESS THEIR CONCERNS ASK THEIR QUESTIONS HAVE OPEN INTO DIALOGUE AND THESE CONVERSATIONS WERE FACILITATED BY SOCIAL WORKERS AND SPIRITUAL COUNSELLORS I'M AND THEN FROM THAT A SMALLER INTERDISCIPLINARY GROUP CRAFTED OUR POLICY. WERE CALLING IT A GROUND UP POLICY REALLY BECAUSE WE WANTED IT TO. COME FROM ALL OF STAFF WE WANTED FOLKS TO FEEL LIKE THEY HAD A VOICE IN WHAT THE PROTOCOL ON POLICY WOULD BE IN THE AGENCY. SO. ONCE THE POLICY WAS CREATED WE ARE ALSO EXTREMELY INTENTIONAL ABOUT HOW WE RULED IT OUT. WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE KNEW WHAT OUR CHOICES HAD BEEN KNEWWHAT THEIR INFORMATION WAS AND TO CREATE JUST ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY AGAIN TO COME BACK TO THE TABLE. AND HAVE DIALOGUE HAVE QUESTIONS A IT SEEMS LIKE THERE IS NO IN% TWO QUESTIONS EXPLORATION IN REFLECTION ON THIS TOPIC. AND SO I PERSONALLY WENT AROUND TO EACH DISCIPLINE AT THEIR OWN STAFF MEETINGS AND CREATED THAT SPACE FOR THEM TAKING UP AN HOUR OR AS MUCH TIME REALLY IS NEEDED. BUT USUALLY THE CONVERSATIONS WERE PRETTY EXTENSIVE. AS WE. CAN TEXT OR TO TO HAVE SOME ON THE GROUND EXPERIENCES. WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT STAFF FELT SUPPORTED THAT THEY FELT THAT THEY. WERE ABLE TO COME INTO MY OFFICE INTO ANYONE'S OFFICE AND HAVE DIALOGUE AROUND IT. WE ALSO WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY KNEW A COUPLE OF THINGS ONE. THEY COULD OPT OUT AND THAT THEIR CHOICE IN THEIR OPINION WOULD BE RESPECTED. AND THAT'S ANYWHERE FROM A DOCTOR TO ANYONE ELSE IN THE AGENCY WHO MIGHT BE ENCOUNTERING FOLKS. AVAILING THEMSELVES. WE ALSO WANTED FOLKS TO HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT THIS ENOUGH. AND HAD ENOUGH CONVERSATION THAT SHOULD THEY ENCOUNTER A QUESTION ABOUT IT FROM. A PATIENT A FAMILY MEMBER EVEN JUST SOMEONE IN THE COMMUNITY IF THEY DIDN'T WISH TO DISCUSS AT THAT THEY COULD. GRACIOUSLY DECLINE THE CONVERSATION AND STEER THEM IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND WE DIDN'T WANT TO PERPETUATE ANY KIND OF SHAMAR JUDGMENT FROM THAT KIND OF QUESTION COMING UP SO. THAT WE WANT FOLKS TO NOT BE CAUGHT OFF GUARD WE DIDN'T WANT IT TO BE A TABOO SUBJECT THAT OUR STAFF MEMBERS WERE WHISPERING ABOUT IN THE CORNERS RIGHT. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT. IS A BIG DEAL FOR OUR STATE AND AND AND FOR OUR AGENCIES SO. ABOUT SIX SEVEN MONTHS IN WE DECIDED TO REVISE THE POLICY WE JUST WANTED TO KIND OF REVISIT ON THE GROUND EXPERIENCES. AND TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT WHAT WAS WORKING INTERNALLY WHAT WASN'T I'M ORIGINALLY WE HAD REQUIRED INTERDISCIPLINARY TEAMS TO HAVE. BOTH A PRE BRIEF AND A DEBRIEF IF ANYONE EXPRESSED INTEREST. IN USING THE MEDICATION THEN THE WHOLE TEAM WOULD MEET A JUST TO MAKE SURE EVERYONE IS ON THE SAME PAGE EXPLORE OPPORTUNITIES. AND THEN. AND THEN AFTER THE DEATH AS WELL JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAD A CHANCE TO SHARE THE STORY. WE FOUND THAT AFTER AWHILE IT WAS A LITTLE BIT LIKE HERDING CATS IT WAS REALLY. DIFFICULT. TO MANAGE THAT WITHIN OUR AGENCY IN SO. AND THAT WAS ONE OF THE REVISIONS THAT WE MADE IN THE POLICY THAT WE STILL STRONGLY ENCOURAGED. FOLKS TO DO THAT BUT THAT IT WAS NO LONGER MANDATORY I'M AND BY THAT TIME WE OBSERVE SOMETHING SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU MENTIONED THAT FOLKS WERE BECOMING MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE. IN TALKING ABOUT IT IN ENCOUNTERING IT SEVERAL PEOPLE THAT HAD ON THE GROUND EXPERIENCES SO WE'VE JUST BEGAN TO. CREATE OPEN FORUMS AGAIN WHERE FOLKS CAN COME BACK TO THE TABLE SHARE THEIR STORIES AND. CLINICIANS REALLY SEEM TO BENEFIT FROM HEARING WHAT OTHER FOLKS HAD ACTUALLY GONE THROUGH WHICH IS ON THE GROUND ACTUAL. STORIES. ALSO SIX OR SEVEN MONTHS AND WE STARTED GETTING A LOT OF PHONE CALLS FROM OUR HEALTHCARE PARTNERS. DIFFERENT FACILITIES WHERE THAT WE WORK WITH OTHER HEALTH CARE AGENCIES WHO HAD SOMEHOW HEARD THAT WE WERE BEING VERY OPEN I'D IN ENGAGING WITH THIS WITH OUR STAFFING COULD WE COME IN. AND HELP THEM FIGURE OUT HOW TO TALK TO THEIR STAFF FIGURE OUT HOW TO CRAFT A POLICY AND SO. I'VE SPENT A FAIR AMOUNT OF TIME DOING THAT WORKING WITH HEALTH CARE PARTNERS IN SAN MATEO COUNTY JUST TO. KIND OF DEMYSTIFY IT IN A WAY ME MY EXPERIENCE OF HAD MANY CONVERSATIONS SO FAR SOME WITH LEADERSHIP AND PRESIDENTS AND DIRECTORS OF AGENCIES AND. DOWN TO HOME HEALTH AIDES IN FOLKS WHO ARE WORKING VERY INTIMATELY ON THE GROUND WITH PATIENTS. AND MY EXPERIENCE EVERY TIME HAS BEEN THAT MOST OF THE PEOPLE GOT UP FROM THE TABLE FEELING BETTER THAN WHEN THEY HAD SAT DOWN. AND IT'S NOT BECAUSE I OFFERED ANY KIND OF. IN LIGHTNING WISDOM IT WAS BECAUSE THEY HAD A CHANCE TO TALK ABOUT IT ASK THEIR QUESTIONS. EVEN IF THERE WAS. YOU KNOW MIXED FEELINGS WITHIN THEMSELVES I MEAN THAT'S PRETTY COMMON RIGHT YOU CAN. YOU CAN HAVE IT MULTIPLE FEELINGS ABOUT ONE PARTICULAR THING PARTICULARLY WHEN IT'S IS A COMPLEX IS THIS. SO. WHAT I WANT? TO SHARE GOING FORWARD. WHAT WE'VE OBSERVED A COUPLE OF THINGS? INTERNALLY WITH OUR STAFF. BECAUSE TO SOME DEGREE THE EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN. BECOME MORE COMMON. NOT EVERYONE IS AVAILING THEMSELVES OF THE KIND OF SUPPORT THAT WE THOUGHT THEY MIGHT NEED AND. SO GOING FORWARD JUST JUST RECENTLY REALIZED NO MAYBE. CLINICIANS DON'T FEEL THAT THEY NEED SUPPORT. BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THEY DON'T HAVE STORIES TO SHARE AND SO THAT'S HOW WE'RE KIND OF SHIFTING. OUR INTERACTION WITH OUR OWN STAFF GOING FORWARD IS CREATING SPACES FOR THOSE STORIES IN IN THAT. PROCESS ANY KIND OF SUPPORT WILL BE. DID UPON AND THERE'S ATTENTION I THINK FOR HOSPICE PROVIDERS BETWEEN. EVERY DAY END OF LIFE CARE THAT WERE USED TO GIVING. AND AND OF LIFE OPTION AT CARE. AND ON THE ONE HAND. IT'S THE SAME CARE WE GIVE EVERY DAY RIGHT THE BEST PRACTICES THAT WE ARE TRYING TO DEVELOP WE REALIZED. WE WANT THIS LEVEL OF COMMUNICATION WITH ALL OUR PATIENTS AND FAMILIES IN BETWEEN THE TEAM. AND AT THE SAME TIME THERE IS SOMETHING. PROFOUND ABOUT THE EXPERIENCE SOMETHING THAT'S HARD TO PUT WORDS TO. AND SO. WHAT I AM COURAGE ALL OF US TO DO IS TO BE ABLE TO JUST HOLD THAT TENSION IN MAKE SPACE FOR ALL OF IT IT'S NEVER REALLY GOING TO BE BLACK AND WHITE? IT'S GRAY. SO WITH THAT. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME I APPRECIATE IT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOOD MORNING. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND ASSEMBLY MEMBERS I AM VERY HAPPY TO BE HERE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE DISCUSSION TODAY. I'M HERE SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE ELIZABETH HOSPICE IN SAN DIEGO ABOUT WHAT OUR EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN. BOTH PRIOR TO IMPLEMENTATION AND SINCE THE ENACTMENT OF THE END OF LIFE OPTION ACT. SOAP MY I'D ARE SET WE ARE THE LARGEST A HOSPICE IN SAN DIEGO AT THIS TIME A WERE NONPROFIT COMMUNITY BASED PROGRAM OUR AVERAGE DAILY CENSUS IS RUNNING ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY. HOSPICE PATIENTS AND WE ALSO OFFER. PALLIATIVE CARE AND WE SERVE OUR CHILDREN AND ADULTS. IN OUR WHAT I ALSO AND I'M ALSO INTERESTINGLY HERE. HAVING EXPERIENCED A RECENT LOSS MYSELF BEING ON THE RECEIVING SIDE OF HOSPICE IMPERATIVE CARE MY HUSBAND DIED A FEW MONTHS AGO. AFTER AN EIGHT YEAR. EXPERIENCE OF STAGE FOUR CANCER AND SO UP ALL OF THIS BECAME WAS AYE I'VE DONE HOSPICE MY WHOLE CAREER IN NURSING BUT AGAIN IT. BECAME UP LESS ABOUT ABSTRACT CONVERSATIONS THAN REALLY THE REALITY OF THESE AND THE IMPORTANCE OF ALL OF THE CONVERSATIONS WE'VE DISCUSSED TODAY. I AND SO SOME OF MY OBSERVATIONS FROM OUR EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN. THAT REALLY THE QUALITY AND HOW THAT'S DEFINED OF LOOK THE QUALITY OF LIVING AND THE QUALITY OF DYING IS A FUNDAMENTALLY IN DEMAND INTIMATE IN INDIVIDUALIZED DEFINITION AND NO TWO ARE ALIKE. AND WHY SOME PEOPLE MAY CHOOSE TO SQUEEZE EVERY POSSIBLE DAY FROM HERE. FRAIL OF WORN OUT BODIES WHILE OTHERS CHOOSE TO BE. HAVE SELF DETERMINATION AND CONTROL ABOUT THE TIMING OF THIS PROCESS. IS AT THIS POINT STILL UNPREDICTABLE I THINK WE'VE SEEN THE DATA WE SEE SOME OF THE PROFILES BUT STILL I THINK REALLY. IT WOULD BE HARD TO PREDICT WHO'S LIKELY TO SELECT THE. THIS OPTION. SO I IN BRIEF IN NINETEEN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WE HAD ABOUT FORTY EIGHT ENQUIRIES ABOUT THE END OF LIFE OPTION ACT. AND ABOUT EIGHT PATIENTS HAVE ACTED UPON THIS OPTION IN IN THE CALENDAR YEAR TWENTY SEVENTEEN. OUR ORGANIZATION STARTED WAY BEFORE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE LAW BECAUSE WE HAD NO. IDEA WHAT TO EXPECT WHERE WHERE PEOPLE GOING TO BE CALLING RIGHT AWAY. HOW WAS THAT GOING TO PLAY OUT THERE REALLY WASN'T A LOT OF? AWAY TO ANTICIPATE THAT SO I THINK YOU KNOW SIMILAR TO LEE AS MY COLLEAGUES WE BEGAN PLANNING EARLY AND DEVELOPED. OF. A TASK FORCE THAT WAS. STAFF AND LEADERS OF ACROSS THE ORGANIZATION. AND I HAVE I HAPPEN TO COULD SHARE THAT WITH OUR C. E. O. OUR BOARD WAS VERY VERY INTERESTED IN THE SUBJECT WE HAVE BROUGHT CONSULTANCY. UP RETREATS ON THIS THEY WERE VERY INTERESTED IN REALLY IMMERSING THEMSELVES TO MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS OR GUIDANCE. WE CREATED A POSITION STATEMENT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES. DEVELOPED A PROCESS FOR CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTION AND. EVEN THAT PROCESS WENT THROUGH SOME YOU KNOW WERE WE SUPPOSED DID WE NEED A LIST OF WHO COULD DO IT AT ANY GIVEN TIME PEOPLE DIDN'T WANT TO BE ON A LIST. SO IT'S WORKED OUT TO BE JUST AN INDIVIDUAL CONVERSATION WITH THE PERSON'S MANAGER AND IT'S WORKED OUT FINE AND WE'VE NOT BEEN AT A YACHT DEFICIT OF STAFF WILLING TO. PARTICIPATE. I SHOULD START BY SAYING THAT OUR ORGANIZATION HAS A ADOPTED THE STAND OF OF EDUCATION AND SUPPORT BUT OUR PHYSICIANS DO NOT PRESCRIBE THE MEDICATION. SO WE'VE TAKEN A STEP TO. UP PROVIDE RESOURCES AND EDUCATE UPON REQUEST OR INCREASE ABOUT THE ACT. AND. A LOT OF THE STAFF NOW THAT IT'S BECOME MORE COMMON IN OUR COMMUNITY KNOW SOME OF THE POSITIONS THAT ARE KNOWN TO UP PERHAPS BE AVAILABLE TO THEM AS CONSULTANTS. AND. AS THOUGH WE ALSO KIND OF WORK THROUGH THE PROCESS OF STAFF AND AND BEING PRESENT OR NOT. UP WE HAD A COPY TALKS WAS THAT ARE KIND OF OUR STRATEGY AT ALL OF OUR DIFFERENT LOCATIONS FROM. RIVERSIDE COUNTY THREE SAN DIEGO THAT STAFF COULD COME AND OTHER CREATE A SAFE SPACE TO DISCUSS IT WITH THAT ASK ANY QUESTION. WITH OUR POLICY YELLED. AND IT CREATED AN ENVIRONMENT FOR PEOPLE TO ASK THINGS THAT THEY WERE PERHAPS UNCOMFORTABLE ASKING AND JUST. TO KIND OF TAKE IT OUT ON THAT THIS CLOAK OF OF LIKE SOME SAID SECRECY. OUT WE DID REQUIRED EDUCATION FOR ALL OF OUR STAFF BECAUSE WE REALLY FELT. THAT THE KNOWLEDGE WAS IMPORTANT SO THAT WE DID HAVE SOME PEOPLE MAKING ASSUMPTIONS OR OPERATING OFF MISINFORMATION OR SIMPLY THEIR. THEIR PERSONAL INTERPRETATION OF WHAT THE LAW MEANT US SO THIS TASK FORCE THAT CREATED ALL OF THIS. THAT SORT OF THE TOOL KIT SO TO SPEAK AND THEN WE HAD QUESTION AND ANSWER SESSIONS WE DID DEVELOP A FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTION HAND OUT AND THAT'S ALSO AVAILABLE FOR FAMILIES. AND THEN DID TRAINING FOR ALL OF OUR VOLUNTEERS AS WELL. IN OUR ORGANIZATION THE SOCIAL WORKERS HAVE BECOME THE PRIMARY. THE PERSON IDENTIFIED WITHIN THE TEAM TO. GO OUT TO HAVE THE CONVERSATION ONCE SOMEONE IS MADE AN INCREASE BOTH THE. ABOUT THE OPTION. AND THEY PROVIDE THE EDUCATION RESOURCES. OF COURSE WE LOOKED AT ALL BUT THE OTHER STATES IMPLEMENTED LOOKED AT OTHERS DOCUMENTS IN A SORT OF USE THOSE AS A JUMPING OUTTA A JUMP START FOR HOURS. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO SIMPLY WISH WE HAD SOME RATHER UNUSUAL AND UNEXPECTED THINGS KIND OF AT THE VERY BEGINNING. OF THE PROCESS THAT WE'RE REALLY OUT OF OUR. AT CONTROL. BUT ARE STILL RATHER ODD IN PART OF OUR OUR NARRATIVE. I'VE RIGHT AROUND THE TIME WHEN THE LAW BECAME ENACTED WE HAD. THE PATIENT WHO ASKED ABOUT THE LAW ASKED ABOUT THIS OPTION DOES IT WAS. YOU KNOW FIVE AT NIGHT SO SEWER CRANK CALLS SPOKE TO THE GENTLEMAN KIND OF BRIEFLY WENT OVER AT THE SET OUT. GONNA SCHEDULED TO COME OUT TOMORROW. BRAND NEW PATIENT WELL THIS DOWN AND TOOK HIS OWN LIFE. AND WAS THAT FOUND WHEN THE STAFF. WENT OUT THE NEXT MORNING AND OF COURSE. IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO EXTRAPOLATE WHAT THAT WAS ABOUT HE HADN'T BEEN ON SERVICE TO REALLY ASSESS BUT. UNFORTUNATELY CREATED A TRIGGERED OF COURSE THE. THE. YOU KNOW THAT COUNTY CAME IN DIDN'T VESTED GAUGE CHEN. AND WHAT IT REVEALED TO US THOUGH WHICH IS. LATER WHEN MY RECOMMENDATIONS IS THAT THE. IN ANY OF THE COMMUNITIES I THINK IN CALIFORNIA THAT THAT WITH A LOCAL AND. STATE HEALTH DEPARTMENT OR YOUNG PUBLIC HELP THEY REALLY NEED TO UNDERSTAND THIS BECAUSE IF THEY'RE COMING INTO SURVEY HOSPICES. THEY HAD ABSOLUTELY NO KNOWLEDGE OR UNDERSTANDING OF IT SO EVEN THOUGH THIS WASN'T. SOMEONE CHOOSING AND GOING THROUGH WITH THAT IT GOT TANGLED UP IN IT IN A SENSE. SO I THINK THAT'S AND I'M AN ACTION STEP THAT WOULD AGAIN AS THEY'RE COMING IN FOR OTHER ISSUES WITH HOSPICES CREATE LESS OF IT I MEAN ADVERSARIAL PUT PUT THEM IN THE CONTEXT OF BEING INFORMED. SO. BUT THIS. THIS ACTUALLY REQUIRED THAT WE PUT INTO PROCESS A SITUATION OF DOING OF SUICIDE RISK ASSESSMENTS ON OUR PATIENTS. SO THAT OF NOT THAT THEY WOULDN'T IN A ROUTINE MATTER BUT IN A VERY FOCUSED WAY SO NOW WE HAVE A PROCESS THAT THERE'S A BRIEF SUICIDE RISK ASSESSMENT FOR ALL. NEW ADMISSIONS AND THEN IF THEY DO REQUEST INFORMATION REQUIRE ABOUT THE. ACT WE DO A MORE IN DEPTH. ASSESSMENT I MUST SAY THAT IT IS NOT DONE IN A IN A MEAN STUFF THAT IT'S PUNITIVE OR A DETERRENT TO IT. BUT SIMPLY AS RISK AVERSION BECAUSE OF THIS WE HAD A FEW. SUICIDES ALL IN A CLOSE PERIOD OF TIME THAT I THINK WERE NOT RELATED TO. PURSUING THE LEGAL PROCESS IN THE MEDICATION BUT PUT IT IN THE CONTEXT OF A MORE RIGOROUS SCRUTINY. SO. BUT THE GOOD PART IS THAT IT YIELDED SOME INCREDIBLE CONVERSATIONS WITH FAMILIES THAT. THEY HAD SOME HAD BEEN SECRETLY THINKING ABOUT. AID IN DYING NEVER TALKED ABOUT IT IT SORT OF OPENED UP THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT WILL. RENO TELL ME MORE WHAT ARE YOU CONCERNED ABOUT ONE OF THE THINGS YOU'RE CONCERNED THAT MIGHT HAPPEN DOWN THE ROAD. SO WE FOUND THAT THERE A LOT MORE PEOPLE. INQUIRING ABOUT IT THAN ACTUALLY CARING THROUGH WITH IT. BUT I DO THINK THAT IT'S THE WHOLE PROCESS HAS YIELDED MORE IN DEPTH CONVERSATIONS ABOUT. LOOKING AT THOSE OF FEARS AND CONCERNS SOME OF THE CHARM REALISTIC SUMMER NOT WHAT OTHER WAYS CAN WE ASSIST PEOPLE THAT HAVE CONTROL IN THEIR LIVES. THIS IS LARGELY I THINK ABOUT CONTROL AND SO WHAT ARE WAYS THAT WE CAN HELP ENHANCE. CONTROL IN THE LIVES OF THE PEOPLE THAT WERE SERVING. SO THIS WE DID A LOT OF TRAINING WITH OURS ARE SUCH WORKERS ON THIS PROCESS. AND AT FIRST I FELT LIKE IT WAS. I THINK THEY WERE CONCERNED IT WOULD BE. OBSTRUCTIVE BUT IT IS NOT. DEMONSTRATED THAT IN OUR PROCESS SO I THINK WHAT IT HAS HEALED IT IS THE RICHNESS OF THE CONVERSATIONS REGARDLESS OF THE FAMILY'S CHOICE TO THE PATIENT'S CHOICE TO CONTINUE OR NOT. ALONG THIS LEGAL PAD. IT'S UP ONE OF THE THINGS I ALWAYS REFERRED TO AS A KIND OF ALLOWED WHAT. DOCTOR I REPLY ACT REFERRED TO AS THE FOUR THINGS THAT MATTER MOST THAT IN WHATEVER TIME THEY HAVE LEFT. THEY HAVE THOSE I THINK OTHERS HAVE DISGUSTED ABOUT YOU KNOW FINDING MEANING IN THEIR LIFE HAVING OPPORTUNITIES FOR. BEING ABLE TO OFFER FORGIVENESS ACCEPT FORGIVENESS GRATITUDE AT CETERA. DOT AND THE OTHER. EXPERIENCE THAT WE SAW THAT AGAIN JUST I THINK FOR TRANSPARENCY IS THAT. WE THEIR THE LAW DOES GIVE THE INDIVIDUAL THE OPTION TO HAVE COMPLETE PRIVACY SO NO ONE ELSE NEEDS TO KNOW AND OF COURSE THE HOSPICE TEAM. RESPECT THAT IN RD BRIEFS WITH THE STAFF WHICH WE TRY TO DEBRIEF INDIVIDUALLY WITH EACH THAT CASE BUT AGAIN DOES SORT OF GO. OFTEN IS MORE INFORMAL AS TIME GOES ON. BUT THAT IT SEEMS THAT IT DID BECAUSE MORE DISTRESSED WHEN THE FAMILY MEMBERS ADULT FAMILY MEMBERS WERE NOT. ALLOWED TO BE INFORMED AND YOU KNOW FLUENT AT THE LAST MINUTE OR WAS KIND OF A FIRE DRILL KIND THAT THE LAST. AND SO WE WILL COURSE HONOR THEIR WISHES AND THEIR PREFERENCES BUT THE SUCH WORKERS HAVE COMMENTED THAT IT DID MAKE IT A LITTLE BIT MORE COMPLICATED WHEN. FAMILY MEMBERS WHO WEREN'T PART OF THAT DISCUSSION WHETHER THEY ALL AGREED OR NOT IT JUST HAVE NOT HAD AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THEIR MAYBE GOODBYES ARE THERE OPPORTUNITY TO. JUST COLLECTIVELY HAVE THAT A DIFFICULT CONVERSATION SO THEY AYE. THE SUMMARY THAT I GOT FROM THE SOCIAL WORKERS IN THERE ON MY INTERVIEWS WITH THEM IS THAT THE WHEN IT IS PLANNED WHEN THERE IS SOME THOUGHTFUL DIALOGUE AMONG THE. FAMILY MEMBERS THAT THE FAMILY MEMBERS TO AND. FOR THE MOST PART EVEN IF THEY DON'T AGREE MAY SUPPORT THE PATIENT'S WISHES BECAUSE THEY AT LEAST UNDERSTAND THE CONTEXT BETTER. SO AGAIN WE'RE WE AREN'T. PRESCRIBING BUT WE DID HAVE OUR ONE OF OUR VERY FIRST OF THAT WENT THROUGH THE PROCESS OF THE PROCESS WITH THE PRESCRIPTION AND THAT THE MEDICATION. ENDED UP TO BE SOMEONE WHO WASN'T A DOCTOR WAS A CHIROPRACTOR. AND THE PATIENT WOKE UP ABOUT A LIKE A COUPLE HOURS LATER AND CREATED A LOT OF DISTRESS AND. WHAT HAVE YOU AND SO AS A RESULT WE CHANGED OUR PRACTICE A SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS THAT NOW IF THE FAMILY WANTS US TO BE THERE WE WILL SO THAT WE CAN IMPLEMENT SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT? IN A WAY PALETTE OF SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT AND BE PRESENT SO WE TO. REQUIRE THAT SOMEONE ELSE BE THERE WITH THE PATIENTS SO THEY'RE NOT THERE ALONE BUT THAT OUR THE BOARD AND OUR ADMINISTRATION FELT STRONGLY THAT IT. OTHER THAN THAT IT WOULD CREATE A SENSE OF ABANDONMENT FOR WHAT THE PATIENT AT THAT TIME SO WE WOULD EVEN INSTITUTE. CRISIS CARE WHICH IS A BENEFIT OF THE MEDICARE BENEFIT IF THEY HAVE. ACUTE SYMPTOMS THAT NEEDED TO BE. OP MANAGED SO. I THINK. IN SUMMARY I THINK THE REFLECTION IS THAT I THINK IT IS TO THE DEGREE THAT ONE WOULD BE. ENCOURAGED TO INCLUDE FAMILY MEMBERS THAT'S OPTIMAL OUTCOME FOR PERHAPS FOR EVERYONE. AND I THINK THAT WHAT I'D LIKE TO SEE IS IT WAS MAYBE MENTIONED BUT I THINK ALL AND I'M SPEAKING AS A HOSPICE PROVIDER. I THINK THAT ALL THE HOSPICE PROGRAM SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO USE THE SAME TRACKING TOOL. OF FROM START TO FINISH OF UP YOU KNOW. HOW MANY INCREASE ARE THERE? WHAT'S THE DISPOSITION DO THEY GET A MEDICATION DO THEY NOT DO THEY USE IT DO THEY NOT SO THAT WE HAVE WE'RE ALL TRACKING THE SAME INFORMATION AND I THINK THAT WILL JUST CONTINUE TO INFORM THE PROCESS. AND POSSIBLY EVEN THE BEREAVEMENT OUTCOMES ALTHOUGH THAT IS MORE LONG TERM BUT IT COURSE JUST THE IMMEDIATE. IMPLICATIONS PERHAPS JUST TO KIND OF GET A SENSE OF THAT. AND AGAIN AS I SAID TRAINING ON THE LOCAL LEVEL FOR THOSE WHO MAY BE SURVEYING INVESTIGATING HOSPICES. AND PERHAPS GREATER TRANSPARENCY WITH A HOSPICE PROVIDER ON WHAT THE MEDICATION IS THAT WILL BE GIVEN SO THAT SHOULD PROBLEMS ARISE. WE CAN BE IS. EFFICIENT AS POSSIBLE AND HELPING. IN EVALUATING THE EFFICACY OF WHATEVER THE MEDICATION COMBINATION IS SO WHILE PATIENTS ARE ALLOWED TO PURSUE ALL THE LEGAL OPTIONS. AS OTHERS HAVE STEP SAID IT'S STILL THIS CRITICAL NEED FOR OUR SYSTEMS TO CONTINUE TO BE AGGRESSIVE IN THE TRAINING REQUIREMENTS FOR ALL THE HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS AS WELL AS. THE GENERAL PUBLIC I DO THINK THERE'S A REAL. LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OF. WHAT EITHER WHAT IT MEANS OR THAT IT DOESN'T? IT THAT THERE'S A PROCESS IN WHO QUALIFIES SO WE DO A LOT OF EDUCATION ON THAT. YOU FOUND THAT SO I THINK SAFE. DIGNIFIED END OF LIFE CARE FOR ALL AND THE MAJORITY OF PATIENTS MAY NOT PURSUE THIS BUT THAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO BE DIPPING AGGRESSIVE IN THAT CARE AND SERVICES THAT WE DO PROVIDE. FOR OUR FAMILIES. AND CONTINUE TO PROVIDE EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES AS OTHERS ARE DOING THAT WE. OUGHT THAT WE'RE ALSO DOING SO I THINK THOSE ARE THE TOP RECOMMENDATIONS THAT. THAT I CAN SEE SO THAT WE'RE CONTINUING TO SERVE OUR PATIENTS IN BODY MIND AND SPIRIT ACROSS THE CONTINUUM FOR PALLIATIVE CARE THROUGH END OF LIFE CARE. SO THAT ALL OUR PATIENTS REGARDLESS OF THEIR CHOICES. EXPERIENCE LAST SUFFERING LESS FEAR AND CAN FEEL CONFIDENT IN THE CARE GIVERS THAT ARE SURROUNDING THEM IN THIS TIME SO. THINK YOU VERY MUCH A AND I DON'T WANT YOU TO TO SEE THAT OTHER MEMBERS LEFT AS A LACK OF INTEREST IT'S JUST A VERY BUSY DAY WITH THE PEOPLE HAVE A LOT OF THINGS AND WE ARE BEING TELEVISED SO THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE. WATCHING AND INTERESTED. ON AN AUGUST EIGHT TO THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH I I WAS A POSSIBLE SOCIAL WORKER AND. WHEN I STARTED THIS STEPPED UP PEOPLE I HEARD THE MOST NEGATIVE FEEDBACK FROM MY FORMER HOSPICE COLLEAGUES AND BECAUSE THERE HAS LONG BEEN KIND OF THE. PEOPLE I THINK OFTEN THINK HOSPICES WOULD BE THE MOST ACCEPTING OF SOMETHING LIKE THIS BUT OFTENTIMES BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN DOING THE VERY HANDS ON WORK FOR SO LONG. IT IS A A TOTAL SHIFT TO THINK ABOUT SOMETHING A DIFFERENT WAY SO I KNOW THE STRUGGLE INTERNALLY. IN THE ORGANIZATION INJURING TO IMPLEMENT THIS SO THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR VERY THOUGHTFUL WORK. THURMOND. JUST WOULD ADD TO THE THANKS FOR YOUR HUMANE AND COMMITTED CARE TO OUR PATIENTS AND. INCORPORATION WITH CORPORATE IN THIS OPTION ANNA HUMANE CARING PASSION THINKING AND I THINK IT'S BEEN CONSISTENT ACROSS PRESENTATIONS ABOUT. THAT MORE DATA WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL BOMB AND MANY ROOM AND WE HAVE SOME WORK TO DO WITH PUBLIC HEALTH AND DIE AND I THINK SOME OF THE A BOMB THE FORMS THAT ARE SUBMITTED AND HOW DO YOU. KNOW HOW DO YOU ENSURE THEY'RE ALL COMPLETE AND HONEY AND SHIRTS ALL REPORTED. AND THEN THE ACROSS SYSTEM STUFF AS YOU KNOW IS EVEN MORE COMPLICATED TO. TO MANDATE IT BEING BETTER PEOPLE ARE DOING IT. I AM. JUST KIND OF THE COLLABORATIVE LIFE BUT. IT IS WHAT IT IS A SO THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH AND AND FOR YOU IF I MAY I JUST WANTED TO ADD ONE OTHER AREA WE'VE READ RECENTLY NOTICED THAT. COULD USE SOME MORE EDUCATION AND DIALOGUE NEEDS ARE ARE MORE DISTANT HEALTH CARE PARTNERS. FOR EXAMPLE WE HAD A A BEREAVED FAMILY MEMBER WHO HAD TO PRETTY DIFFICULT EXPERIENCES ONE BEING AT THE PHARMACY WHEN SHE WENT TO PICK UP THE MEDICATION. THAT THE PHARMACIST. THEY HAD NO SENSITIVITY AROUND. OR OR AND DISCRETION AROUND WHAT WAS THE EXCHANGE THAT WAS HAPPENING AND SO YOU KNOW THAT. COULD BE REMEDIED ON A LOCAL LEVEL AT LEAST BY US JUST GOING AND HAVING A CONVERSATION AGAIN SETTING UP AT THE TABLE SHE ALSO MADE A PHONE CALL TO HER INSURANCE PROVIDER. AND THE PERSON ON THE OTHER END SEEM VERY ILL PREPARED TO KNOW WELL I'M NOT ALLOWED TO TALK ABOUT THAT AND PRETTY MUCH HUNG UP YOU KNOW SO. AND THERE ARE THESE OTHER WAYS THAT WE HADN'T NECESSARILY THOUGHT OF WHERE WE CAN CONTINUE TO HAVE DIALOGUE AND CONVERSATION JUST TO TRY AND GET. PEOPLE TO FEEL LITTLE MORE AT EASE. BE GREAT IF WE COULD LEGISLATE KINDA SYMPATHY. WHEN IT OUT. YOU DON'T KNOW PLEASE. NECK NECK NEXT NEXT YEAR FILMING OF ANYTHING HELP WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THE CONTINUE DIALOGUE INTO. A LEARN FROM EACH OTHER TO CONTINUE TO COLLECT INFORMATION AND DATA THAT I THINK HELPS US ALL MAKE MORE INFORMED DECISIONS FOR ORGANIZATIONS AND TO. JUST ENHANCE OCCUR WERE PROVIDING SO WE APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE DIALOGUE TODAY. AND BLOW FORCING HER TO BACK NEXT YEAR WILL DO IT AGAIN AND KEEP GETTING BETTER OKAY THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. NEXT UP WE HAVE THE PATIENTS EXPERIENCE AS WE HAVE KEEP WEST AND INDIA'S COMPASSIONATE CHOICES. BAQUBA COIN FROM UCSF RAHEEM HUSSEINI.

THANK YOU AGAIN TO. THE LEGISLATORS HERE. AND. THE IMPACT THAT THIS HAS HAD AS WAS BROUGHT UP EARLIER IS THAT IT HAS ENCOURAGED. CONVERSATIONS ABOUT AND OF LIFE MORE SO THAN JUST MEDICAL AID DYING. THE FACT THAT A HUNDRED ELEVEN INDIVIDUALS UTILIZE THIS. THAT AFFORDED THEM A GENTLE DYING PROCESS BUT THE REAL BENEFIT. AND AND WE'VE HEARD REPORTED OVER AND OVER THE LA TIMES WORDS WROTE A STORY ON IT. OR THAT PEOPLE ARE HAVING THESE CONVERSATIONS AND IT'S NOT A SCARY THING ANYMORE. WE CAN TALK ABOUT THE STUFF WE SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH KITCHEN TABLE CONVERSATIONS WILL NEED TO HAVE A. THANK YOU SO MUCH AND. AS A AS A LATINO ES. THINKING ABOUT DEATH RATE YOU INDOCTRINATED INTO THE LAST PERSON DOESN'T MENTION YOUR NAME SO. CLEARLY PRETTY WILL LIVE ON FOREVER THANK. BOB. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. UP THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY MY NAME IS BARBARA CAME A I'M THE DIRECTOR OF THE BIOETHICS PROGRAM AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO. AND WERE. AT THE POINT WHEN. THOUGH THE LAW WAS SIGNED. WE'VE WE BELIEVED THAT IT WAS IMPORTANT FOR SOMEONE TO STEP FORWARD AND OF BE TO SERVE A CONVENING FUNCTION. FOR THE ACADEMIC HEALTH SCIENCE CENTER AND THE ETHICS COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE AND SO. THAT YOU CASF WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES LINDSAY FORBES WHO'S HERE. WE STEP FORWARD AND STARTED TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WOULD BE A GOOD WAY OF GETTING PEOPLE ON THE STATE TOGETHER. AND I SHOULD SAY THAT I THINK THE TESTIMONY PRETTY THIS MORNING HAS SHOWN THAT THIS IS NOT AN EASY THING TO IMPLEMENT. SO IT'S IT'S USEFUL FOR US TO GET TOGETHER AND SHARE EXPERIENCE BUT IT HAS NOT BEEN EASY. SO I WANT TELL YOU VERY BRIEFLY ABOUT A A PROJECT THAT WE'VE DONE. IN COLLABORATION WITH UCLA AND THE COALITION TO ADVANCE COMPASSIONATE CARING CALIFORNIA. WITH FUNDING FROM THE STEPS KEY FOUNDATION AND THE CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION. SO WE HAVE DONE WITH A THREE PART PROJECT WHICH INVOLVED CONVENING KEY STAKEHOLDERS FROM AROUND THE STATE WHICH INCLUDES AN INCLUDING PATIENTS. DOING THE SURVEY THE DOCTOR CAME MENTIONED EARLIER AND DOCTOR WINGER. AND ALSO DOING A PROJECT TO COLLECT THE NARRATIVES OF PATIENTS AND A LOT THIS IS ON THE THEME THAT. ASSEMBLY. MEMBER EGGMAN HAS TALKED ABOUT ABOUT THE ISSUE OF DATA SO WE WE NEED A LOT MORE DATA ABOUT ALL OF THE THE INDIVIDUALS WHO MAKE USE OF THE ACT IN TERMS OF THE IMPACT AND I'LL SAY MORE ABOUT THAT IN A MOMENT. BUT WE ALSO NEED THE SORT OF IN DEPTH NARRATIVE DATA THAT WE GET FROM FROM PATIENTS AND FAMILIES WHO STEP FORWARD AT HEARINGS LIKE THIS. BUT ALSO WE WANTED TO MAKE A LITTLE BROADER BY SYSTEMATICALLY OF REACHING OUT. AND MAKING AVAILABLE PARTICIPATION IN THE STUDY OUR GOAL IN THIS PROJECT IS TO COLLECT TWENTY DETAILED NARRATIVES. SORRY INCLUDING. A PATIENT HIM OR HERSELF A FAMILY MEMBER AS WELL AS OF THAT AS WELL AS A CLINICIAN INVOLVED WITH THE SITUATION SO THAT PROJECT IS IN. PROCESS BUT IT WILL BE A RESOURCE I THINK FOR YOUR COMMITTEE AS WE MOVE FORWARD ONCE WE START A DOING THAT DATA ANALYSIS. I WANT TO GIVE YOU ONE EXAMPLE OF THE KIND OF INFORMATION THAT CAN COME FROM THIS KIND OF QUALITATIVE STUDY. WHICH MIGHT NOT COME UP IN ANOTHER WAY. AND SO WE'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT THE ISSUE OF TIMING AND HOW HARD IT IS TO GET THE PROCESS STARTED IT CETERA. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE DISCOVERED WAS JUST AT A SMALL THING BUT I THINK AN IMPORTANT THING. THERE CAN BE A COMPLETE MISMATCH BETWEEN WHETHER A PATIENT THINKS THAT THEY'VE MADE A REQUEST. ABOUT PHYSICIAN AID IN DYING AS OPPOSED TO WHAT. THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM HAS HEARD WHAT AN INDIVIDUAL CLINICIAN HAS HEARD OR WHAT A HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IS PREPARED TO HEAR. BECAUSE ON THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM PART THIS IS A VERY FORMAL THING IN S. B. MEMORIALIZED UNDOCUMENTED. BUT THE PATIENT SOMETIMES GET OUT OF WHACK IN TERMS OF THE TIMING BECAUSE. THEY WILL SAY WELL BUT I I RAISE THAT TWO MONTHS AGO WITH MY ONCOLOGIST I YOU KNOW I SAID THAT I WANTED TO DO THIS. WHY ARE YOU NOT HEARING ME ARE LISTENING TO ME SO THAT JUST ONE EXAMPLE I WANT TO? BUT. I THINK I'M NOT IN THE INTEREST OF TIME I THINK I WAS GOING TO READ SOME INTERESTING QUOTES YOU OF THAT PEOPLE'S REASONS FOR DOING THIS WHICH ARE VERY. INTERESTING PERHAPS I COULD JUST SUMMARIZE BY SAYING YOU KNOW WE WORRY. ONE OF THE FUNCTIONS OF MY TEAM IN PARTICULAR MY GROUP HAS BEEN TO GET PEOPLE WHO'VE BEEN HISTORICALLY OPPOSED TO THESE PRACTICES TO WORK TOGETHER WITH INDIVIDUALS HAVE BEEN PROP PROPONENTS. AT THIS PARTICULAR MOMENT WHEN IT'S NOW THE LAW AND IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO GET THIS RIGHT IN TERMS OF AND OF LIFE CARE. ALTOGETHER IN CALIFORNIA. AND AND SO IN IN TRYING TO DO THAT. WE. ARE I WOULD ARGUE AND I THINK MOST PEOPLE WOULD ARGUE YOU WE DON'T WANT THIS TO BE PRACTICE FOR THE WRONG REASONS MEANING LACK OF ACCESS TO PAY THAT YOU CARE. UP OF OF HOPELESS LIKE AND POVERTY IT CETERA. I'M SO THE REASONS ARE VERY VERY IMPORTANT AND WHAT WE'RE HEARING IS AND I JUST WANT TO SUMMARIZE ONE ONE. PATIENT ACTUALLY SAID TO US. ALL I WANT IS TO BE FREE OF THIS BODY. THEY WERE JUST LITERALLY AT THE END AND THAT WAS ALL THEY COULD. UNDERSTAND THAT THAT WAS THAT WAS WHERE THEY WERE. SO I ALSO WANT TO. I SHOULD ALSO POINT OUT IT IS HERE. REALLY INVOLVED PATIENTS AND FAMILIES WHO HAVE CHOSEN TO MAKE USE OF SOME OF THE SPECIALTY PRACTICES ON THAT. ARE AT THAT HAVE DEVELOPED IN THE STATE TO IMPLEMENT THE THE LAW. AND SO WE ALSO HAVE SOME OF THAT INFORMATION AND WE CAN. WE. WILL WE'RE FOLLOWING THE STORIES OF WHAT ARE THE BARRIERS IN INDIVIDUAL HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS WHETHER THE ENABLERS. WHY DO PEOPLE CHOOSE TO GO OUT OF THEIR OWN HEALTH CARE SYSTEM AND TO GO ELSEWHERE? AND ALL THOSE THINGS I THINK ARE GOING TO BE VERY HELPFUL. AND FINALLY I'LL SAY THAT ACROSS THE STATE. WE DID CONVENE A MEETING WE CONVENE TO MEETINGS ACTUALLY ONE FOR PLANNING WHICH ASSEMBLY MEN ACT EGGMAN DID ATTEND. AND THEN IN SEPTEMBER WE GOT A HUNDRED AND TEN INDIVIDUALS FROM AROUND CALIFORNIA TOGETHER. OUGHT TO THINK ABOUT POLICY AND OUR GROUP AT UCSF WILL BE ALL THAT IS AND WE ALSO WILL BE AVAILABLE AS MANY POLICIES AND PROCEDURES AND BEST PRACTICES THAT WE HAVE. COLLECTED FROM AROUND THE STATE THAT WILL ALL BE MADE AVAILABLE ON A WEBSITE AT THE CALIFORNIA COALITION AND ALSO AT UCSF SO HOPEFULLY THAT WILL BE AND. AN OPPORTUNITY AS YOU MOVE FORWARD. I THINK IN ON THE DATA ISSUE I WANT TO EMPHASIZE ONE ISSUE THAT I THINK IS VERY SPECIFIC AND VERY IMPORTANT. AND THAT IS THAT WE DON'T HAVE GOOD DATA ABOUT THE RANGE OF DIVERSITY. UP OF THE INDIVIDUALS WHO MAKE USE OF THE ACT AND THAT'S PARTLY I THINK BECAUSE OF A AND THAT OF A PROBLEM IN THE WAY THAT THAT DATA IS BEING IT IS IS BEING OBTAINED AT THIS PUNK MOMENT. AND IT'S BEING OBTAINED BY LOOKING AT THE DEATH CERTIFICATE. AND I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT THAT LOOKING AT A DEATH CERTIFICATE IS NOT A GOOD WAY TO ASCERTAIN SOMEONE SELF IDENTITY YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF THEIR OWN. ETHNICITY EXPERIENCE IT CETERA. THIS SO I THINK THAT'S A VERY SPECIFIC MODIFICATION THAT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AND OUR GROUP WAS ACTUALLY SENT. A WRITTEN TEST AND YOU KNOW WRITTEN INFORMATION TO THE STATE. OUGHT TO THE DEPARTMENT AND THAT IS IT RESPONSIBLE FOR COLLECTING THIS DATA. SO WILL CONTINUE THIS EFFORT OF GETTING PEOPLE TOGETHER AROUND THE STATE MAKING RESOURCES AVAILABLE. ARE ALSO A NUMBER OF US FROM THAT PROJECT ARE GOING TO WASHINGTON NEXT MONTH OF BECAUSE THE OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF MEDICINE HAS CONVENED WITH FUNDING FROM ANOTHER FOUNDATION. OF A TWO DAY MEETING THAT WILL LET US. HELP IT SURE THE CALIFORNIA EXPERIENCE MORE BROADLY SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY OF. OF BEING HERE TODAY AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH JOHN AND MIKE I DISCLOSES LESSEN MY JUST LIKE TO SAY IT AT THE TIME A RESEARCH. IN AND DR COHN'S WORK IS SOME OF WHAT I USE WHEN I WAS ON MY DISSERTATION WE MET FOR THE FIRST TIME IN SAN FRANCISCO SO I'LL FEEL SO FULL CIRCLE. WE'VE CAP WESTON ASK AND THEN RIGHT HE MASINI. SO GOOD MORNING CHAIR GOOD MORNING SMITTY MEMBERS MY NAME IS KAT WEST I AM THE NATIONAL DIRECTOR OF POLICY AND PROGRAMS FOR COMPASSION CHOICES. AND COMPASSIONATE CHOICES IS THE LARGEST AND OLDEST NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION IN THE NATION WORKING TO IMPROVE CARE AND EXPAND CHOICE AT THE END OF LIFE. TO HELP WITH SAFE AND SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ACT. COMPASSIONATE CHOICES LAUNCHED WHAT IS CALLED THE CALIFORNIA ACCESS CAMPAIGN. AND IT WAS A MASSIVE BILINGUAL EFFORT TO EDUCATE THE PUBLIC. A DOCTOR'S MEDICAL PROVIDERS OF PHARMACISTS INSURANCE COMPANIES ACROSS THE STATE. WE HAVE LITERALLY TALKED TO OVER A THOUSAND. MEDICAL PROVIDERS DOCTORS PRACTITIONERS AS WELL AS TERMINALLY ILL PEOPLE AND THEIR FAMILIES WE PROVIDED EDUCATION AND SUPPORT TO THEM. JUST FOR EGGS AN EXAMPLE A WE HAVE A DOCK TO DOCK CONSULTATION LINE WHICH IS A FREE. PHONE LINE THAT ANY DOCTOR IN CALIFORNIA OR THE OTHER OFF ANY OF THE STATE'S. CAN CALL TO SPEAK WITH ONE OF OUR NATIONAL MEDICAL DIRECTORS IN OREGON WHO HAS EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE WITH MEDICAL AID IN DYING WE ALSO HAVE A PHARMACIST A PHARMACIST LINE. WHICH IS VERY SIMILAR. WE'VE BEEN PARTNERING WITH HOSPITALS HEALTH SYSTEMS HOSPICES OF MEDICAL ASSOCIATIONS AND WE'VE ALSO BEEN PARTNER IN WITH GROUPS SUCH AS THE PROMONTORIES. LATINO COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS. TO ADDRESS THE EXACT ISSUES THAT WE HEARD ABOUT HEALTHCARE DISPARITIES EARLIER. I THINK EVERYONE AGREES THAT RIGHT NOW WE ARE IN THE RAMP UP PERIOD OF IMPLEMENTATION. AND THAT EACH YEAR. ACCESS TO THE LAW WILL GET BETTER AND BETTER AS HEALTH CARE CONSUMERS BECOME EMPOWERED. AROUND THE LONG AND AROUND HEALTH CARE AS HEALTH SYSTEMS SEEK TO IMPROVE. THEIR SYSTEMS BOMB AND AS DOCTORS BECOME EDUCATED AND MORE COMFORTABLE WITH THE LAW. IN FACT THE NUMBER ONE THING THAT WE'VE HEARD FROM PATIENT AND DOCTOR EXPERIENCE. IS THAT THERE ARE SOME DOCTORS WHO FEEL STRONGLY ABOUT THIS. THEY KNOW RIGHT AWAY HOW THEY FEEL BUT THE MOST DOCTORS. DON'T KNOW HOW THEY FEEL THEY HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT IT UNTIL THEIR FIRST PATIENT ASKS. AND THEN IT BECOMES A REAL TO THEM AND THEY HAVE THAT CONNECTION WITH THAT THE SACRED PATIENT DOCTOR RELATIONSHIP. BECOMES REAL TO THEM AND THEN THEY DECIDE YES I'M GONNA HELP MY PATIENT BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT MY PATIENT WANTS THIS IS PATIENT DIRECTED CARE. SO EVERY YEAR IS GOING TO GET BETTER AND BETTER PHAM SAID LIKE TO SHARE FOUR MAIN TAKEAWAYS. FIRST THE LAWS WORKING AS INTENDED. OFF FROM OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH PATIENTS AND DOCTORS AND HOSPICES WE BELIEVE APPROXIMATELY FIVE HUNDRED. TERMINALLY ILL PEOPLE HAVE RECEIVED PRESCRIPTIONS. IN CALIFORNIA AND THE FIRST YEAR. UP THE NUMBER ONE FRUSTRATION THAT WE HEAR FROM PATIENTS OF FAMILY MEMBERS IS THE PROCESS IS TOO BURDENSOME. THE PAPER THERE'S TOO MUCH PAPERWORK. THERE'S JUST THE WAITING PERIOD IS TOO LONG IT JUST TAKES TOO LONG IT'S TOO MANY HOOPS TO JUMP THROUGH. THESE PATIENTS. THEY'RE DYING THEY DON'T HAVE A LOT OF TIME THEY DON'T WANT TO SPEND SPEND THEIR PRECIOUS. TIME TRYING TO. JUMP THROUGH ALL THESE HOOPS THEY WANT TO SPEND IT WITH OUR FAMILIES AND SO I I JUST URGE YOU TO KEEP THAT IN MIND. AS WE GO FORWARD AND WE IMPROVE OUR PROCESSES. SECONDS PATIENTS ARE REPORTING FEELING VERY EMPOWERED AROUND THE LAW. THEY'RE HAVING IN DEPTH CONVERSATIONS WE'VE HEARD THIS OVER AND OVER AGAIN IS IT IS THE THEME. THEY ARE HAVE IT'S THE EXCUSE FOR THEM TO FINALLY TALK TO THEIR DOCTORS ABOUT WHAT THEY REALLY WANT AND DOCTORS REPORTING THE SAME THING. IT'S REALLY TRANSFORMING THE END OF LIFE EXPERIENCE. FOR PATIENTS. A THIRD BY OUR COUNT. EIGHTY FOUR. EIGHTY FOUR PERCENT OF SECULAR HEALTH SYSTEMS IN CALIFORNIA NOW HAVE POLICY SUPPORT OF A PATIENT AND OF LIFE CARE THAT'S PHENOMENAL. IT TOOK OREGON TWENTY YEARS TO GET TO WHERE CRAP CALIFORNIA MADE IN ONE YEAR. SO THAT TRANSLATES TO OVER FIVE HUNDRED HEALTH CARE FACILITIES AND OVER A HUNDRED HOSPICE LOCATIONS. ON THE GROUND ACROSS THE STATE. I'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT THAT SEVERAL HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS OF NOT ONLY ADOPTED SUPPORT OF POLICIES BUT THEY HAVE IMPLEMENTED THE INTERNAL REFERRAL IMPATIENT NAVIGATOR SYSTEMS THAT YOU HEARD KAISER AND UC DAVIS TALK ABOUT TODAY. THAT IS THE GOLD STANDARD. WE WERE REALLY URGE ALL HELL SYSTEMS TO GO TOWARDS THAT SYSTEM IT IT GUY IT. IT JUST INCREASES THE PATIENT SATISFACTION X. M. EXPERIENCE AND WE HAVE FOUND THAT IT ALSO HELPS GREATLY WITH HEALTHCARE DISPARITY. BECAUSE THE MORE SUPPORTIVE A SYSTEM IS OF THE MORE THAT PEOPLE WHO. ARE HISTORICALLY HAVE NOT GOTTEN GOOD HEALTH CARE WILL GET ACCESS TO THIS LAW. I FOURTH. UNFORTUNATELY SOME HOSPITALS AND HOSPICES ARE STILL PROHIBITING THEIR DOCTORS FROM PRESCRIBING UNDER THE LAW. AND I'VE GOT GOOD NEWS THOUGH. OF WE HEARD EARLIER ABOUT. PEOPLE ARE ASKING FOR SOME SORT OF REPOSITORY OF HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS THAT HAVE THESE SUPPORT OF POLICIES. WE HAVE CREATED AN ONLINE FIND CARE TOOL WHICH IS PUBLICLY AVAILABLE ON OUR WEBSITE IT'S ONE OF OUR MOST HEAVILY VISITED A WEB PAGES THAT WE HAVE. IT IT'S AN UP TO DATE LIST OF HOSPITALS CLINICS AND HOSPICES THAT HAVE ADOPTED POLICIES WE HAD MORE FACILITIES EVERY MONTH. AND. IT IS A VERY VERY USEFUL TOOL. FOR RESIDENTS. SO IN CLOSING WE HEAR FROM TERMINALLY ILL PEOPLE AND THEIR HEALTH CARE TEAMS EVERY WEEK WHO ARE FILLED WITH GRATITUDE. THAT THEY HAVE THE OPTION OF MEDICAL AID IN DYING. WHICH ALLOWS THEM TO LIVE THEIR REMAINING DAYS TO THE FULLEST KNOWING WITH PEACE OF MIND. THAT THEY CAN CHOOSE A PEACEFUL DEATH IF THEY'RE SUFFERING BECOMES UNBEARABLE. AND I'D LIKE TO THANK ALL THE FAMILY MEMBERS AND ALL THE PROVIDERS THAT ARE HERE TODAY. AND THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER EGGMAN SENATOR MINING AND SENATOR WALK. FOR YOUR COURAGE AND YOUR COMMITMENT TO THE END OF THE LIFE. END OF LIFE OPTION I THINK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND AGAIN THANK YOU TO COMPASSION CHOICES FOR ALL THE WORK THEY'VE DONE. IF SMOKING MAY GO SPACE NEXT UP WE HAVE MISTER. OF. FOR HE MYCENAE. THE REPORTER. AND HIS ALSO HAD A PERSONAL EXPERIENCE SO PUBLIC MANY OF YOU LIKE ME HAVE. BRED. READ ABOUT HIS MOTHER'S EXPERIENCE AND HIS EXPERIENCE A MORNING OF MARKETS A AFTERNOON ACTUALLY I THANKS FOR CONVENING THIS PANEL. I'M A HAMER SE ANY. JOURNALIST BY TRADE. BUT I'M HERE'S A SIGN AND. THOSE TWO ASPECTS ACTUALLY COMBINED. LAST YEAR WHEN I WROTE A STORY THE. YOU MENTIONED ABOUT MY MOM'S. INABILITY TO ACCESS A THE AID IN DYING MEDICATION. FAT DESPITE. BEING ELIGIBLE FOR EIGHT AND HAVING THE FULL SUPPORT. OF HER DOCTORS HOSPICE CARE PROVIDERS AND HER FAMILY. AND I WOULD YOU KNOW I WAS THINKING A LOT ABOUT WHAT I WANTED TO. TELL YOU GUYS ABOUT MY MOM. AND SO I I THOUGHT I'D DROP IN JUST LIKE A FEW LITTLE TIDBITS AT SOMEONE AND GROWING UP BUT SHE WAS. YOU KNOW SHE SHE FIRST THOUGHT USE UNDENIABLY CHAIRMAN. SHE DID NOT. CARE TO DRIVE ON THE FREEWAY. SHE WAS A TEACHER PRESCHOOL KINDERGARTEN TEACHER AND STARTED DOWN BUSINESS. AND NEVER TALKED. TO HER STUDENTS AND SO THEY HAD TO ORDER AND LOOKED UP TO HER FOR THAT. SHE CHEATED AT SPADES. SHE WAS NOT A DRINKER BUT YOU CAN POLISH OFF A BOTTLE OF GOOD SHOPS. AND SHE SHE COULD BE LATE TO THINGS BUT SHE WAS ALWAYS AHEAD OF HER TIME. AND I THINK THAT WAS THE CASE HERE SHE WAS I HAD EVER TIME AND THIS AND SOCIETY SIMPLY HADN'T CAUGHT UP TO WHERE SHE WAS. WHEN SHE GOT. HER DIAGNOSIS IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR IS A REALLY SCARY I SHE'S DIAGNOSED WITH MULTIPLE MYELOMA WE HAD NEVER HEARD OF IT BEFORE. I DID WHAT ANY TEAM LOVING TEENAGE SON WOULD DO WHICH IS I LOOKED AT WHICH CELEBRITIES HAD THIS DISEASE BECAUSE THAT TELLS YOU. YOU KNOW IF IT WHETHER IT'S LIKE WRITTEN TRULY PENETRATED. SOCIETY. THE ONLY ONE I COULD FIND WAS ROY SCHEIDER SO THAT TO ME WAS A RARE DISEASE. AND SHE OVER THE NEXT TWENTY TWO YEARS THAT THE PROGNOSIS WAS NOT GREAT THEY TOLD HER SHE HAD. IF SHE WAS LUCKY FEW YEARS FIVE YEARS. AND THEY. RECOMMENDED THAT SHE STARRED AGGRESSIVE CHEMOTHERAPY THAT WAS NOT HAPPENING THAT WITHOUT MY MOM. SO OVER THE NEXT TWENTY TWO YEARS SHE BATTLED IT HER WAY. THROUGH A STRICT REGIMEN OF. HOLISTIC REMEDIES AND NATURAL DIETS THAT HER HER FAMILY WASN'T ALWAYS ON BOARD WITH BUT I MEAN SHE DID IT HER WAY. AND. FOR HER IT WAS MORE IMPORTANT TO LIVE AS HERSELF THEN MERELY SURVIVE AT SOMEONE ELSE AND THAT THAT EXTENDED TO. HOW SHE SAW AND WANTED TO CONFRONT HER OWN DEATH AS WELL? AND SO YEARS BEFORE ON. CALIFORNIANS AND OF LIFE ACT TOM CAME INTO PLAY SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT HER DESIRE TO WHEN THE TIME CAME. TAKE AGENCY OVER THE LAST THING SHE WOULD EVER DO IN THIS WORLD. AND SO SHE LOOKED AT THE OTHER STATES WHERE. THAT HAD ADOPTED DEATH WITH DIGNITY ACTS DIFFERENT COUNTRIES SHE THOUGHT ABOUT. YOU KNOW MOVING TO IT TO SOME OF THE STATES OR COUNTRIES BUT CALIFORNIA WAS OUR HOME AND YOU DON'T WANT TO LOOK LEVER HOME. SO WHEN THIS LAW WAS PASSED IT WAS A GREAT RELIEF TO HER AND WHEN SHE. ON MY DAD MYSELF AND SHE MET WITH THE ONCOLOGIST AND GOT THE NEWS THAT SHE HAD MONTHS LEFT TO LIVE. BUT THE FIRST QUESTION SHE ASKED WAS ABOUT OKAY HOW DO I DO THE SAME TIME THING. AND LIKE AND. I THINK A LOT OF THE STUMBLES THAT HAPPENED OUR PART OF THE RAMP UP THAT WERE DESCRIBED. OTHERS. YOU KNOW THERE WAS TROUBLE JUST GETTING BASIC PAPERWORK YOU KNOW LIKE WE WERE TOLD IT HAD BEEN MAILED TO OUR HOUSE. EVEN THOUGH THERE IS A WHEN YOU COULD ACCESS ONLINE OF THEM YOU KNOW IT IT FELT LIKE DIFFERENT ASSISTANCE THEN MAIL IT TO SOMEONE HAD TO DRIVE IT OUT TO US THINGS LIKE THAT AND THAT WERE. BUT AVOIDABLE BUT. IT'S NOT. MORTAL SINS IN THE LAW OUR MORTAL FLAWS. SO BUT THERE WERE OTHER ISSUES LIKE THE HOSPICE CARE PROVIDER AND THE HEALTH CARE PROVIDER INITIALLY CAN DECIDE WHOSE RESPONSIBILITY IT WAS TO TAKE IT TO THE NEXT PHASE. THEN FINDING EVEN HER ONCOLOGIST WAS ON BOARD TO DO THE ONE OF THAT NECESSARY CONSULTATIONS BUT FINDING THAT OTHER DOCTOR. PROVED DIFFICULT AND TIMELY AND IT WAS TIME THAT MY MOM RAPIDLY DO NOT HAVE AND. ONCE A DOCTOR WAS FOUND THEN IT WAS A DISCUSSION ABOUT COULD WE HAVE THIS PERSON DO A HOME VISIT BECAUSE MY MOM WAS TOO WEAK TO LEAVE. HER HOME AND THEN THAT ENSUED MULTIPLE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT WHAT CONSTITUTED BATTERY. AND SO THAT WAS DIFFICULT. AND SO FINALLY WHEN THE DOCTOR CAME IN HE WAS GREAT I MEAN HE'S COMPASSIONATE KIND PATIENT AND IN ANOTHER THIS IS A REFLECTION OF THE PHYSICIANS THE HOSPICE CARE WORKERS. ALL OF THEM WERE PHENOMENAL IF IT'S JUST ABOUT THE. OBSTACLES THAT WERE BUILT INTO THE SYSTEM. BY THE TIME HE SHOWED UP HER HOUSE SHE CAN NO LONGER PARTICIPATE IN A MEANINGFUL WAY IN THIS INTERVIEW SHE COULD SAY. I AM DYING I HAVE THIS CANCER I WANT THIS EIGHTEEN DOWN AYE MEDICATION BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO BE IN PAIN BUT THERE WAS A WHOLE LIST OF OTHER QUESTIONS THAT SHE CAN ANSWER. PART NOT TO HIS STANDARD BUT TO THE LOS STANDARD. AND SO SHE WASN'T ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS AND. THAT WAS. REALLY DIFFICULT BECAUSE I THINK MORE THAN ANYTHING SHE LIKE OTHERS AT THIS PANEL AND TODAY HAVE SAID SHE JUST WANTED THE OPTION. SHE WON THE CHOICE. AND I THINK THE LAST THING I'LL SAY ABOUT MY MOM IS. SHE YOU KNOW WHO I BEFORE I WAS AROUND. IN ADDITION SHE GREW UP IN GERMANY POST WAR POVERTY SHE WAS AND IMMIGRANTS USES SINGLE WORKING MOM WHEN THAT WAS TABOO. SHE WAS A PRO CHOICE ADVOCATE BEFORE ROE V. WADE. SHE WAS ALWAYS KIND OF PUSHING THESE BOUNDARIES AND NOT SO MUCH AS. JUST. THROUGH ACTION CENTER LIFE AND HER LIVED EXPERIENCE. AND WHEN THE WORLD LETTER DOWN IT WAS BECAUSE IT WASN'T AS COMPASSIONATE OR FORWARD THINKING OR BRAVE AS SHE WAS. AND THIS CALIFORNIA WAS OUR HOME AND. IF. WE CAN TAKE. FOR THIS PANEL CAN TAKE ANYTHING FROM HER. MAYBE JUST. THAT LOOK TO HER AS A LITTLE BIT OF AN EXAMPLE AND TRY TO. YOU KNOW PUSH THIS. I'LL LA LITTLE BIT FORD AND AND THE LAST THING I TASTE SHE'S NOT COUNTED. IN THE RECENT STATE PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT REPORT AND HAVE TALKED OTHER FAMILIES WHOSE LOVED ONES. ARE NOT COUNTED. AND I THINK YOU CAN'T HAVE HER NO. HOW GOAL LAW IS WORKING OR NOT WORKING UNLESS YOU COUNT EVERYONE SEC THANK YOU? THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANYMORE VERY SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS AND YEAH I THINK YOUR MOM WAS S. PIONEER WHO WAS ONE OF THE FIRST ONE TO TRY TO ACCESS IT IN AND HIT ALL THE. ROAD BLOCKS AND I THINK THE SYSTEMS HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS HAVE TRIED TO ADDRESS SINCE SO. SO SHE WAS THE LEADER AND THE SYSTEMS ARE COMING ALONG BEHIND HER THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OKAY. NEXT UP WE HAVE BY KELLY DAVIS. SOME. EMINEM IS KELLY DAVIDSON NAM THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO SHARE THE STORY OF MY SISTER BETTY DAVIS. I AM ALSO A JOURNALIST AND AND WROTE ABOUT BETSY'S. EXPERIENCE USING THE END OF LIFE OPTION ACT AND. AND ONE THING SHE REALLY HOPE SHORTLY BEFORE SHE DIED IS THAT SHE COULD BE AN EXAMPLE OF HOW THIS LAW. COULD HELP PEOPLE AND SO HOPEFULLY IT. SHE'S I'VE WHO APPEARS TODAY OUT OF IT AT FOUR THIRTY. THE TO GET AN EARLY FLIGHT FROM SAN DIEGO SO HOPEFULLY SHE'S SHE IS PROUD OF ME FOR DOING THAT. JUST TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT BETSY SHE WAS A REMARKABLE PERSON. BUT SHE WAS A TALENTED INNOVATIVE ARTISTS USE A WORLD TRAVELER SHE WAS A STRONG INDEPENDENT WOMAN. AND SHE HAD A KILLER SENSE A HUMOR. SHE'S VERY SILLY SHE'S STILL TO THIS DAY HOLDS A WORLD'S RECORD FOR DRAWING THE MOST PORTRAITS WITH CAN OF WHIPPED CREAM. IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME HER WHERE HER WEBSITE WITH THEIR ART IS A QUEEN OF PLASTICS DOT COM AND THERE'S A VIDEO OF HER AND SETTING A WORLD RECORD. IN TWENTY EIGHT AND JULY TWENTY THIRTEEN BETSY WAS DIAGNOSED WITH A LS. AND I CAN'T IMAGINE A COOLER DISEASE IT SLOWLY ROBS THE PERSON OF THE ABILITY TO MOVE SPEAK EAT AND EVENTUALLY BREATHES AND CURRENTLY THERE IS NO EFFECTIVE TREATMENT. AND AFTER HER DIAGNOSIS SHE MADE THE MOST OF EVERY MINUTE OF EVERY DAY BUT SHE INCREASINGLY LUSTER INDEPENDENCE. IN THE MONTHS BEFORE SHE DIED I WATCHED HER STRUGGLE TO EAT AND SPEAK. AND DO SIMPLE THINGS LIKE SCRATCHING AN ITCH OR BRUSH A STRAY HAIR FROM HER EYES. HER BIGGEST FEAR WAS BEING PUT ON A VENTILATOR ROBIN TO RELY AND THE FEEDING TUBE. AS SHE SAID SHE IS SHE DIDN'T WANT TO BE IN TUNED IN HER OWN BODY THAT WAS HER BIGGEST FEAR. I WAS WITH THEIR ON JUNE NINETEENTH TWENTY SIXTEEN. THE DAY THE END OF LIFE OPTION NOT TO THE FACT. AND THANK YOU SO LIMON EGGMAN IN SENATORS MONEY IN AND AND WILL. AND COMPASSIONATE CHOICES AND DAN AND BEN BRITNEY HAVE IF NOT FOR YOU GUYS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED BUT. THAT DAY WERE SITTING OUT ON HER PER PORCH AND. THE RELIEF THAT SHE FELT. IT JUST CAME OVER HER WHEN SHE ASKED HER CAREGIVER. PLEASE GO SCHEDULED THE APPOINTMENT WITH THEM THEIR PRIMARY CARE DOCTOR TO GET THE PROCESS GOING. AND SHE SET THE DATE OF HER DEATH FOR SUNDAY JULY TWENTY FOURTH THAT I KNOW FOLKS HAVE TALKED ABOUT. THAT THE PROCESS OF PAPERWORK AND THE DELAYS BUT AT LEAST FOR BETSY. A GIVER CHANCE TO GET HER AFFAIRS IN ORDER IT GAVE HER FRIENDS A CHANCE BY PLANE TICKET AND AND GAVE SOME FIT OF OUR FAMILY A CHANCE TO COME TO COME TO TERMS WITH BETSY'S CHOICE. SHE INVITED HER CLOSEST FRIENDS AND FAMILY TO HER HOUSE IN OHIO FOR TO DAY CELEBRATION. MORE THAN THIRTY PEOPLE SHOWED UP TO HELP SEND BETSY ON WHICH YOU REFERRED TO AS HER NEXT GREAT ADVENTURE. THERE IS MUSIC BOOZE GOOD FOOD LOTS OF PHOTOS SHE INVITED EVERYONE TO GO AROUND THE HOUSE AND TAKE OF BETSY SOUVENIR OF ONE OF HER PERSONAL ITEMS TO REMEMBER HER BY. AROUND AT SIX FORTY FIVE PM THAT SUNDAY WE DID SET UP A MAKESHIFT BED UNDER WHITE CANOPY ON A HILLSIDE NEXT TO OUR HOUSE. BUDGET A COMBINATION OF MORPHINE PENTOBARBITAL AND CHLORO HYDRATE. AND SHE FELL ASLEEP S THE SUN WAS SETTING. MY SISTER IS AN EXAMPLE OF EXACTLY WHAT DOES LAW INTENDED TO DO ALLOWED A DYING YOUNG WOMAN TO ASSERT CONTROL. OVER THE CHAOS AND UNCERTAINTY OF A TERMINAL ILLNESS AND SHE TURNED THAT INTO A REASON TO CELEBRATE AND SHE WAS THERE TO JO ANNE SHE ENJOYED EVERY MINUTE OF THAT PARTY. JUSTIN OVER HERB TO RECOMMENDATION I MEAN OVERALL IT WORK THE LAW WORKED AS IT SHOULD AND. I MEAN THEIR MAIN PROBLEM. WAS A WE WANTED A IS TO GET SEEK AND ALL FOR HER THAT WAS THE DRUG THAT HER DOCTOR. PRESCRIBED. AND BETSY HAD MEDI CAL SO WAS COVERED. WE CALLED NUMEROUS PHARMACIES WITH NO SUCCESS NO NOBODY HAD IT OR THEY WEREN'T. WILLING TO PROVIDE THE QUANTITY BETSY NEEDED ONE PHARMACY SAID THAT THEY WOULD. DRAW THE ATTENTION OF THE FDA IF IF THEY WERE TO PROVIDE THE AMOUNT OF OF SECRET ALL THAT SHE NEEDED. SO WE ENDED UP GOING WITH THAT THE MIX OF THAT THE CLERK HYDRATING AND PENTOBARBITAL WHICH WAS. THIS KIND OF TOXIC SLUDGE THAT WE TRIED TO MASK THE TASTE WITH THEM. SOME COCONUT MILK BUT IT WAS STILL FATTEN YOU KNOW PRETTY PRETTY NASTY STUFF. AND. I HAVE HEARD STORIES OF PATIENTS WHO HAVE GOTTEN SIGNAL BUT THEY'LL GET IT IN CAPSULE FORM. AND SO SOMEBODY HAS TO SIT THERE AND PULL OPEN THE CAPSULES BUT TO MAKE CERTAIN POWDERED JUICE. I JUST QUALIFIED PATIENTS SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO THE MOST EFFECTIVE. EASIEST TO TAKE MEDICATION. NO ESPECIALLY FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE DIFFICULTY SWALLOWING AND THERE REMAINS ISSUE OF ACCESS US SINCE I WROTE ABOUT BETSY'S DEATH I RECEIVED COUNTLESS EMAILS FROM TERMINALLY ILL PEOPLE AND THEIR FAMILIES. AND THEY WANT TO KNOW THE NAME OF BETSY'S DOCTOR WHICH WE HAD PROMISED HER SHE IS A VERY SMALL PRACTICE AND NO HIGH AND WE PROMISED HER. WE WOULDN'T GIVE HER HER NAME OUT. AND. OVERTIME THESE EMAILS HAVE SLOWED I STILL RECEIVE THEM I'M REALLY HAPPY TO HEAR AND COMPASSION CHOICES PUT TOGETHER THE ONLINE LIST OF FACILITIES AND I'LL BE IT DIRECTING FOLKS TO THAT LIST. I'VE ALSO HEARD FROM OTHER ALS PATIENTS. WHO FEAR THAT THE LOSE THE ABILITY TO ADMINISTER THE DRUG? FOR THERE READY TO GO I'M AND WHILE THE LAW AS AS I UNDERSTOOD IT AT THE TIME. IT ALLOWS CARE GIVERS TO PROVIDE SOME ASSISTANCE. FOR BETSY WE HAD TO TO PROP UP. THE CUP AND AND ALSO. SOME OF THE MEDICATION WAS RUNNING DOWN HER CHIN SO WE KINDA HAD TO SCRAPE IT UP TO MAKE SURE SHE GOT IT ALL. SO WE PROVIDE ASSISTANCE AND WE UNDERSTOOD THAT WAS OKAY. AND BUT I KNOW THERE'S OTHERS WHO BELIEVE THERE CAN BE NO ASSISTANCE AT ALL AND I THINK IF THERE'S ONE DISEASE THAT. THIS LAW WAS DESIGNED FOR ITS ALS. AND THEN. WE WERE SO FORTUNATE THAT BETTY'S PRIMARY CARE DOCTOR WAS WILLING TO SUPPORT HER CHOICE YOU ALSO HAD A. A HOSPICE NURSE WHO IS VERY SUPPORTIVE. LOOKING BACK. I ONLY NOW KNOW HOW LUCKY WE ARE AND I JUST I THINK OF THEM ALL THE TIME. AND I AM GRATEFUL FOR THAT. ITS OF AGAIN THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR GIVE ME THE CHANCE TO TO SHARE BETSY STORY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'M SURE HE'S VERY PROUD THAT YOU GOT UP AT FOUR THIRTY. BY. AND SO INTO IT BOTH ADJOURNMENTS WE WE ALL READ ALL OF YOUR WORK AND AND NOW AND FOR DIFFERENT REASONS SHARED THEM WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE SO. MEAN YOUR WORDS GO FURTHER THAN THAT I THINK YOU YOU AND NOW. THANK YOU. OKAY AND. ROBERT STONE. I AM FORGET STONE. I'VE. AND MY HUSBAND WAS BOB STONE AND HE WAS. ONE OF THE FIRST CHECKS. TO EXERCISE WHOSE CALIFORNIA. END OF LIFE OPTION. WHEN I AM HERE TO SAY THANK YOU. AND TO TELL YOUR LITTLE ABOUT THE EXPERIENCE THAT WE SHARED. MY HUSBAND DID NOT WANT TO DIE. HE LOVED LIFE HE LOVED HIS WORK. HE LOVED RUNNING MARATHONS HE LOVED BICYCLING TRAVELING MEETING NEW PEOPLE HE LOVED LIFE. IN MAY TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN BOB WAS DIAGNOSED WITH LATE STAGE MULTIPLE MYELOMA. THIS WAS BEYOND DEVASTATING TO BOTH OF US AND TO OUR FAMILIES. MY HUSBAND WAS A VERY ANALYTICAL MAN. WITHIN DAYS HE KNEW. EVERYTHING ABOUT THAT CANCER. ANY NEW IN COLD HARD FACTS. WHAT HIS FUTURE HELD? BOB CHOSE THE TREATMENT THAT WAS RIGHT FOR HIM. CHEMOTHERAPY WOULD GIVE HIM ONE TO THREE YEARS LIKE X.. EXPECTANCY. IN OCTOBER TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN HIS CHEMO IS COMPLETED. ANNE MET WITH HIS STE ONCOLOGIST. YOU'RE GIVING HIMSELF ANOTHER YEAR TO. HE IN THE DOCTORS WOULD WATCH THE NUMBERS AND WAIT. WHAT WAS REFLECTED IN THE NUMBER IS SPOT COULD FEEL IN HIS BODY? JUNE TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN CALIFORNIA PASSED THE END OF LIFE OPTION. BOB SIGNED HIMSELF RIGHT UP HE. WAS ECSTATIC. A HUGE WEIGHT WAS LIFTED FROM HIS SHOULDERS. HE'D MADE A VERY PERSONAL A MAN'S FLEE. DIFFICULT DECISION. AND HE MADE PEACE WITH HIMSELF. AND I PROMISE THAT I WOULD RESPECT AND HONOR THAT. BOB'S CURRENT ONCOLOGIST AT KAISER MEDICAL FOUNDATION DIDN'T SUPPORT THE END OF LIFE OPTION. SO BOB REALLY. QUESTIONED TO BE REFERRED TO ANOTHER ONCOLOGIST. HE WAS EXAMINED BY TWO MEDICAL DOCTORS AND BECAME A PATIENT IN THE PALETTE OF CARE UNIT OF KAISER. THEY MADE HIM FEEL LIKE USE THE MOST IMPORTANT PERSON IN THE WORLD. IT MADE BOBSO COMFORTABLE IN HIS SITUATION AND IT ENABLED HIM. TO ACTUALLY ENJOY AND TO VALUE THE REMAINDER OF HIS LIFE. HIS TEAM CONSISTED. OF THE ONCOLOGIST BY HOSPICE PHYSICIAN AND ARE IN IN A SOCIAL WORKER. THEY WERE ALL IN CONSTANT CONTACT WITH HIM. AND WITH EACH OTHER. THEY CAME THE ARE AND CAME TO THE HOUSE REGULARLY. AND THE WHOLE TEAM WAS AVAILABLE TO HIM. BY PHONE AND EMAIL AND REGULAR OFFICE VISITS AND THE HOSPICE DOCTOR ALSO VISITED HIM AT HOME. IN JULY TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN BOB'S MY LOW NUMBERS STARTED GOING UP RAPIDLY. HE COULD SEE THAT IN THE TEST RESULTS. AND IN THE CHANGES IN HIS BODY. SO HE MET WITH A COMPOUNDING PHARMACIST. FOR AN HOUR. THE PRESCRIPTION WAS THREE DIFFERENT DRUGS FIRST AN ANTI NAUSEA DRUG. THEN ONE TO SLOW THE HEART. AND KEEP IT FROM GOING TOO FAST. AND THEN NINETY SECOND ALL'S WHEN KELLY. I AM SORRY BUT I CAN TELL YOU WHO WHO. NINETY SECOND ALL'S ALSO IS A TOXIC SLUDGE. AND A MATTER OF FACT BOB. MIX IT IN APPLE SAUCE. AND I TOOK A LITTLE TASTE OF IT THOSE AWFUL. SO WE PUT A LITTLE ARTIFICIAL SUGAR IN IT. I GAVE IT TO HIM. HE TOOK IT TASTED HE SAID. SO LITTLE BETTER NEXT TIME I THINK I'LL TRY THE PUTTING. SO ANYWAY THE PHARMACIST. I WISH BOB WELL ANY ASKED IF HE COULD PRAY FOR HIM. BOB TOOK THE MEDICATIONS HOME ALONG WITH A DETAILED SET OF INSTRUCTIONS. PUT THEM IN A DRESSER DRAWER WENT ON WITH HIS LIFE. AND THINGS GOT WORSE. AT THE BEGINNING OF SEPTEMBER. BOB RECALLED TO ME THAT ON SEPTEMBER TENTH NINETEEN FIFTY SIX HE ARRIVED. IN SUNNY LOS ANGELES FROM BUFFALO NEW YORK WITH HIS MOTHER BROTHER AND SISTER. THAT BEGAN THEIR NEW LIFE. AND HE SAID HE'D LIKE TO TAKE THE MEDICATION ON SEPTEMBER TENTH. ON SEPTEMBER TENTH. BOB WAS SO CALM. SO AT PEACE. WE SPENT THE DAY REMINISCING ABOUT HIS LIFE OUR LIFE TOGETHER. WE'VE IN LASTED SOME OF ARE STUPID MISTAKES THAT WE HAD MADE. NOW WAS OUR LAST DAY TOGETHER. HERE I SNUGGLED UP AS TIGHTLY AS WE COULD. HIS LAST WORDS TO ME WERE. I CAN FEEL IT ALREADY IT'S GOOD. AND THEN YOU DIE PEACEFULLY AND QUICKLY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND THANKS TO BOB. AND FINALLY WE HAVE BUT JACQUI MINOR. GOOD MORNING I'M JACQUI MINOR I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF MY MOM SHERRY AND MY SISTER VALERIE. ALAN IF MY FATHER HAD. DR JON MINOR COULD SEE ME SEATED IN THE ROOM WITH ALL OF YOU HERE TODAY. HE WOULD FEEL EXTREME HAPPINESS AND GRATITUDE. HE WAS ONE WEEK SHY OF HIS EIGHTY FIRST BIRTHDAY ON THE EVENING HE OPTED TO PUT A PERMANENT END TO HIS SUFFERING. IT WAS SEPTEMBER FIFTEENTH TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN. HE'D FOUGHT FOR TWO YEARS THROUGH WHAT I CONSIDERED TO BE UNIMAGINABLE SUFFERING. HE HAD PULMONARY FIBROSIS. OTHER DOCTORS JUST DEEMED IT A. RARE TERMINAL LUNG DISEASE. MANY OF THE DOCTORS DIDN'T HAVE A VERY GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF HIS ILLNESS. HIS CONDITION WENT FROM VIOLIN EXTENDED COUGHING FITS TOO EXTREME OXYGEN DEPRIVATION TO EXCESSIVE MUCOUS AND HIS LUNGS. WHERE WE NOTICE THAT MORE COULD REALLY HAVE BEEN DONE TO MAXIMIZE HIS MOBILITY AND WELL BEING? WE HAD TO AGGRESSIVELY ADVOCATE FOR HIM THROUGH MOST OF HIS ILLNESS. HE SPENT HIS REMAINING MONTHS WEEKS AND DAYS AND RELENTLESS ATTEMPTS TO COMPOSE HIS STORY AND A PERSONAL STATEMENT TITLED THE RIGHT TO ASSISTED DYING. HIS FOCUS LAY IN BROADENING THE DIALOGUE ON ASSISTED DYING. SO MY FAMILY HAD MANY CONVERSATIONS ABOUT IT. MORPHINE AND FENTANYL OF MAY THINGS POT FOGGY. BUT STILL WITH GREAT LUCIDITY HE WAS ABLE TO SAY THAN WHAT HE WOULD OF PRO FAMILY WANTED TO HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SAY TO ALL OF YOU. IN PERSON TODAY SO THESE ARE HIS WORDS. I WANT TO EXPRESS MY DEEPEST GRATITUDE TO THOSE OF YOU WHO FOUGHT TO BRING THIS ISSUE FORWARD. I AM MOST GRATEFUL AND EXTREMELY RELIEVED TO EXPERIENCE YOUR COMPASSION JUSTICE ENCOURAGE IN THE ONGOING STRUGGLE TO MAKE THIS AVAILABLE TO ALL. MY DAD THOUGHT MANY DOCTORS OVER THOSE TWO YEARS AND WE WERE UNABLE TO FIND ANYONE WHO WOULD CONSIDER SUPPORTING HIS WISHES FOR MEDICAL AID IN DYING. MOST OF THEM WERE RELUCTANT TO EVEN DISCUSS IT AS AN OPTION AFTER THE LAW HAD PASSED. AT THAT TIME WHAT I DESIRED MORE THAN ANYTHING WAS A DATABASE WITH DOCTORS WHO WOULD SUPPORT MY FATHER'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE IS DEATH. SHOULD HE MEET THE CRITERIA SET FORTH IN THE LOT. IN BETWEEN RESEARCHING A FAMILY MOVED ORGAN AND COLD CALLING HOSPITALS LOOKING FOR A DOCTOR. WE STRUGGLE TO OBTAIN PRESCRIPTIONS THAT WOULD MEET MY FATHER'S NEEDS WHILE HIS CODEINE COUGH SYRUP WAS INITIALLY PRESCRIBED FOR EVERY SIX HOURS. THE ADMINISTRATION OF HIS DOSAGES SOON REQUIRED GREATER FREQUENCY AND WE WERE OFTEN LEFT SCRAMBLING TO OBTAIN THE NECESSARY PRESCRIPTIONS. WE REPEATEDLY DEALT WITH NEARLY RUNNING OUT OF ALL DIFFERENT TYPES OF MEDICINE. DURING THOSE TIMES WE WERE ALWAYS SCARED THAT HIS SUFFERING WOULD SPIKE AND WE WOULD NOT HAVE THE RIGHT MEDICATION TO PROPERLY TREAT HIM. ONCE OR TWICE WE THOUGHT WE WERE REALLY CLOSE TO FINDING THE RIGHT HOSPICE PROVIDER. AND THEN THEY WOULDN'T HAVE ANY PRESCRIBING DOCTOR IS. DURING ONE OF MY COLD CALLS I REACHED THE END OF LIFE COORDINATOR AT KAISER IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. I HAD FINALLY FOUND A HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL THAT PERSONALLY NEW DOCTORS WILLING TO PRESCRIBE THE MEDICATION. CONNECTING WITH THIS WOMAN WAS IN LARGE PART DUE TO THE COMPASSION AND CHOICES WEBSITE. WHICH REPEATEDLY PROVED A CRITICAL RESOURCE THAT IN WHAT FELT LIKE A VERY UNINFORMED UNPREPARED DISCONNECTED MEDICAL WORLD. IT WAS A MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH IN OUR JOURNEY. TWENTY TWO MONTHS INTO MY DAD'S TREATMENT WE YANKED HIM FROM ALL OF HIS DOCTORS AND NURSES AND ENROLLED HIM IN KAISER. IT WAS A BIG DECISION THAT WE DID NOT TAKE LIGHTLY. WITHIN WEEKS HE HAD HIS MEDICAL RECORDS TRANSFERRED WAS ENROLLED IN HOSPICE AND ASSESSED FOR END OF LIFE MEDICATION. IT BROUGHT HIM TREMENDOUS PIECE ONCE HE BEGAN THIS PROCESS WITH KAISER. I CALLED ON HOSPICE FOR GUIDANCE AND SUPPORT SEVERAL TIMES IN HIS FINAL FEW WEEKS A DIFFERENT PERSON WOULD COME EACH TIME. AND EACH ONE WHEN THEY WENT DOWN THE ROAD OF A PLAN FOR TREATMENT FOR THAT DAY OR THAT WEEK WE FELT COMPELLED TO TELL THEM. SAVE YOUR BREATH HERE THAT HE'S GOING TO END HIS LIFE VERY SOON. IT WAS A DIFFICULT CONVERSATION TO HAVE TO KEEP REPEATING. ALL OF THE HOSPICE STAFF HAD OPINIONS ABOUT MY DAD'S FINAL CHOICE. ONE OF THEM WAS VERY FORCEFUL IN THAT HIS DECISION WAS WRONG AND BASICALLY A MORAL. SHE DIDN'T EVEN BELIEVE IN TAKING MEDICATION WHICH IS WHAT HAD KEPT MY DAD ALIVE TO THAT POINT HOSPICE. SHOULD SUPPORT THE DECISIONS OF THE PATIENT NOT JUDGE AND CRITICIZE THE SHOULD BE A CORE VALUE DOWN TO EVERY LAST CARE GIVER. ONE ALWAYS HEARS HOSPICE WILL MAKE THE PATIENT COMFORTABLE. MY DAD WOULD HAVE REFUTED THE STATEMENT. HE EXPERIENCED THE LOCK OF ANYONE'S ABILITY TO MAKE HIM COMFORTABLE AND SAID SO REPEATEDLY. IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS AND IMPROPERLY DIAGNOSED THRUSH CONDITION IN HIS MOUTH PROVED TO BE ONE OF THE GREATEST AND MOST PAINFUL CHALLENGES OF HIS ENTIRE TWO YEARS OF SUFFERING. THE TO PHARMACISTS THAT HAND DELIVERED THE END OF LIFE MEDICATIONS WERE INCREDIBLE. THE PROCESS OF ADMINISTERING THE MEDICATION WAS TIME INTENSIVE AND ANXIETY PROVOKING A HE DID HAVE THE SECOND ALL CAPSULES.

WE TO AS MANY OTHERS HAVE SPOKE HAD A PARTY WE HAD A COUPLE BARBECUES OVER THE WEEKENDS YOU KNOW THEIR BARE NOT OF AND A BOTTLE OF TEQUILA. THOSE TYPES OF THINGS IT WAS A CELEBRATION IN HE WAS IN CHARGE OF IT. I WOULD ECHO WHAT MY MOTHER SAID ABOUT KAISER PERMANENTE A ENTER HOSPICE PROVIDERS THEY WERE ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS. IT WAS A LITTLE DISHEARTENING TO HEAR SOME OF THE STORIES ABOUT THE TIME LINES AND THAT THAT WAS A PROBLEM FOR PEOPLE WE DID WE WERE VERY FORTUNATE WE DID NOT FACE ANY UP THAT. SO I THINK LISTENING TODAY I WASN'T PREPARED TO SPEAK BUT I THINK I FOUND MY CALLING I'M GOING TO GET INVOLVED IN THIS ORGANIZATION AND PUSH THIS THROUGH A LITTLE MORE. ARE DO WORK FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES LIVE WORK AND MEDI CAL AND MY BROTHER WAS A MEDI CAL AND VERY FORTUNATE THAT THE STATE COVERS THAT FOR MEDI CAL BENEFICIARIES. SO WE'LL BE SEEING MORE BALLOT THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HELLO I'M LYDIA ANGER ME FROM SACRAMENTO. ELEVEN DAYS AGO. MY SISTER USED END OF LIKE OPTION. SHE WAS A PIONEER WE'RE WITH KAISER. NEITHER. HER ONCOLOGIST INTERNISTS HOSPICE WORKERS PALLIATIVE CARE WORKERS PHARMACIST OR CARDIOLOGISTS. HAD HAD A PATIENT YET. THEY WERE INFORMED SORT OF. THE PHARMACIST CAME TO THE HOUSE DELIVER THE MEDICATION HE WAS WONDERFUL WE FOUND OUT AFTERWARDS. THAT HE HAD NO EXPERIENCE WITH A REAL LIFE PERSON WHO IS DYING. AND THERE WERE SOME PROBLEMS WITH THAT. MAIN THING I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE LAW WE BEEN FOLLOWING THIS FOR LONG TIME. FROM THE DAYS OF DOCTOR KEVORKIAN WHO WAS WAY AHEAD OF HIS TIME AND SO IN OUR FAMILY WE HAVE DISCUSSED THIS AND WE COME FROM A MEDICAL FAMILY. HAVING THAT THE MEDICINE WAS A COMFORT. A IT DOES GIVE PEOPLE A CHOICE IT GIVES THEM THE SENSE OF SATISFACTION IN FACT THEY FOUNDED WITH RESEARCH ANALYST LESIA. THAT PEOPLE HAVE ANESTHESIA AT HOME POST OPERATIVE OR WHATEVER THEY USE LESS BECAUSE THEY HAVE CONTROL OF IT THEMSELVES THAT WAS HUGE FOR US. ALSO I MUST SAY THAT. BECAUSE WE HAD THE TIME TO BUILD UP TO THE TO THE END. BECAUSE WE DID IT TOGETHER BECAUSE MY SISTER WAS AT HOME WITH FAMILY. BUT THEY CAN'T TELL RIGHT NOW THE POST GRIEVING IS EASIER THAN ANY GRIEVING I'VE BEEN THROUGH WITH OTHER MEMBERS OF MY FAMILY WHO HAVE DIED SUDDENLY. SO IT'S A BLESSING FOR THE PEOPLE WHO ARE DYING AND I THINK IF IT WERE ANY INDICATION FOR THE PEOPLE WHO ARE LEFT BEHIND REMEMBERING. NO ONE MORE THING LAST THING. BOTH MY SONS ARE PHYSICIANS THEY WERE WITH US. WE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THE MEDICATION. THERE WAS THE. COCKTAIL BEFOREHAND SO THAT SHE WOULDN'T BE NAUSEOUS THAN SOMEONE. AND THEN WE SHE HAD THIS SEEK IN OUR. WHAT I'M HEARING HERE IS THAT THERE ISN'T ANY THERE ARE ALTERNATIVES LESS EXPENSIVE ALTERNATIVES THERE'S A HOME? PHARMACIES THAT CAN. CAN COMBINE. MEDICATIONS WE DIDN'T KNOW THAT WE NEVER HEARD IT THAT WOULD BE NICE TO KNOW THAT THEIR ALTERNATIVES I WAS READING MY SON'S READ WE NEVER HEARD THAT I READ THAT. BUT AS SHE WAS DYING ISSUES A HUNDRED POUNDS MAY BE AND WE WERE TOLD THAT MAYBE IN AN HOUR OR SO SHE WOULD DIE. TOOK A SIX AND A HALF HOURS JUST THE LONGEST TIME THAT WE WERE TOLD TO USUALLY FIVE HOURS WITH THE OUT SIDE. THAT WAS. EXCRUCIATING FOR THOSE OF US WHO WERE WATCHING HER DIET NOT FOR HER SHE WAS PEACEFUL SHE WAS IN A COMA RIGHT AWAY. IT WAS WONDERFUL FOR HER. I WOULD JUST SUGGEST THAT THERE'S MORE INFORMATION ON THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF MEDICATION. CERTAINLY HOPEFULLY TO BRING THE PRICE DOWN AS WELL. AND. OUR HOSPICE AT KAISER DIDN'T SAID THEY COULDN'T BE PRESENT ONE WHEN SHE TOOK THE MEDICINE AND DIED THAT HASN'T BEEN MY EXPERIENCE WITH PREVIOUS HOSPICE EXPERIENCE. AND. I DON'T KNOW I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT THAT WOULD OF BEEN HELPFUL BECAUSE THEY WOULD HAVE HAD. MAYBE MORE MORPHINE MORE MEDICATIONS TO GIVE HER. AS SHE WAS IN HER COMA TO BOB AND. SPEED IS THAT SHE WOULD HAVE HATED TO MOUNTAIN LINGER SHE REALLY PHOTO BE FASTER. SO ANYWAY THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK PONCE TO THIS VERY MEANINGFUL EXPERIENCE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS. AND WE'LL LINGER WANTED TO BE ABLE TO MAKE A STATEMENT AS A AS AN INDIVIDUAL. MANY OF MY PHYSICIAN COLLEAGUES HAVE INDICATED TO ME THAT THEY FEEL THAT THEY'RE FORCED TO BE UNTRUTHFUL. WHEN WE'RE NOT BEING ABLE TO RITE AID IN DYING ALONG WITH THE TERMINAL CONDITION ON THE DEATH CERTIFICATE. THANK YOU. HI ó I MEAN GO AND LIVE HERE IN SACRAMENTO AND ON MY HUSBAND AND I WORKED OF WITH CAPTAIN WE CAME AND VOLUNTEERED. MANY MANY TIMES TO COME DOWN TO THE CAPITOL WHEN YOU WERE BEGINNING TO PASS WITH.
