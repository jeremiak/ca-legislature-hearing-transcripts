01:01:59.449 --> 01:01:59.849
WITH THE PROJECT. SO I

01:01:59.916 --> 01:02:00.917
APPRECIATE THE TO PROP ONE BY.

01:02:00.983 --> 01:02:02.118
IT'S THE WAY THE FOR A MINOR

01:02:02.185 --> 01:02:02.718

WILL COME ALL THESE PROJECTS.

01:02:05.321 --> 01:02:07.190
IS THAT TRUE. SO AT THAT POINT

01:02:07.256 --> 01:02:08.691
WE WOULD THEN HAVE TO

01:02:08.758 --> 01:02:10.726
SUPPLEMENT THEM. SO THAT I

01:02:10.793 --> 01:02:12.161
GUESS A BIT GOES BACK TO MY

01:02:12.228 --> 01:02:14.230
ORIGINAL POINT OF WHY DOES THE

01:02:14.297 --> 01:02:15.231
ADMINISTRATION NOT BELIEVE

01:02:15.298 --> 01:02:16.666

FOR WATER STORAGE IN THIS

01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:19.068
CURRENT BUDGET TO SUPPLEMENT

THE CULTURAL AND NATURAL

01:04:09.245 --> 01:04:09.745

APPRECIATE ANY. DATA OR

01:10:29.158 --> 01:10:31.360
EVIDENCE THAT SEEK WAS NOT A

01:10:31.427 --> 01:10:34.897

01:10:40.169 --> 01:10:42.371
AGGRESSIVE TIMELINE BUT I

01:10:42.438 --> 01:10:43.272
CERTAINLY WOULD. WOULD HOPE

CHANGES INDEPENDENT STUDY WHAT

01:19:38.673 --> 01:19:40.142
OF THINGS THAT WERE HAPPENING

01:19:40.208 --> 01:19:40.976

DISTRICTS CAN YOU JUST GIVE ME

01:19:42.577 --> 01:19:44.546
KIND OF A SENSE OF WHY THAT WHY

01:19:44.613 --> 01:19:47.616
THESE CHANGES WERE NECESSARY.

01:19:47.682 --> 01:19:48.884

01:19:48.950 --> 01:19:52.754
COUPLE. WE JUST GOT HOMES

01:19:52.821 --> 01:19:54.990
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE MAJOR

01:19:55.056 --> 01:19:58.426
CHANGES THAT WERE MADE IN SB

01:19:58.493 --> 01:19:59.528
ONE SIXTY SEVEN ARE REFLECTIVE

01:19:59.594 --> 01:20:02.197
AND INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE

01:20:02.264 --> 01:20:02.831
COLLECTED THROUGHOUT THE SUMMER

01:20:02.898 --> 01:20:05.667
AFTER THAT. ENACTMENT OF THE

01:20:05.734 --> 01:20:07.402
ORIGINAL HONEST TRAILER BILL

01:20:07.469 --> 01:20:08.937
THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND

01:20:09.004 --> 01:20:10.472
EDUCATION HONEST TRAILER BILL.

01:20:10.539 --> 01:20:12.674
AND IT WAS NEVER THE INTENT OF

01:20:12.741 --> 01:20:15.577
THE ADMINISTRATION- TO NOT

01:20:15.644 --> 01:20:18.580
PROVIDE APPORTIONMENT TO AND

01:20:18.647 --> 01:20:21.249
LEDS ARE PROVIDING INDEPENDENT

01:20:21.316 --> 01:20:22.517
STUDY STUDENTS WHO WERE

01:20:22.584 --> 01:20:25.954
QUARANTINED- NOTED TO IT TOO TO

01:20:26.021 --> 01:20:26.488
NOT PROVIDE THEM WITH THE

01:20:26.555 --> 01:20:28.957
FORTUNATE FOR THAT- AND SO THAT

01:20:29.024 --> 01:20:30.892
THE MAJOR CHANGE IN THIS BILL

01:20:30.959 --> 01:20:32.994
WOULD ENSURE THAT WHEN A LOCAL

01:20:33.061 --> 01:20:34.796
EDUCATIONAL AGENCY IS PROVIDING

01:20:34.863 --> 01:20:36.031
THAT INDEPENDENT STUDY TO THAT

01:20:36.097 --> 01:20:37.499
QUARANTINE STUDENT THEY CAN

01:20:37.566 --> 01:20:39.534
RECEIVE THAT APARTMENT- THIS IS

01:20:39.601 --> 01:20:41.803
REALLY CONNECTED TO- I THINK

01:20:41.870 --> 01:20:43.171
WITH. A SHARED PRIORITY AMONG

01:20:43.238 --> 01:20:43.672
THE LEGISLATURE IN THE

01:20:43.738 --> 01:20:45.740
ADMINISTRATION THAT STUDENTS

01:20:45.807 --> 01:20:47.142
ARE RECEIVING A CONTINUITY

01:20:47.209 --> 01:20:48.677
CONSTRUCTION EVEN WHILE THEY'RE

01:20:48.743 --> 01:20:51.513
QUARANTINED- AS OPPOSED TO YOU

01:20:51.580 --> 01:20:52.380
KNOW GOING HOME AND NOT YOU

01:20:52.447 --> 01:20:53.949
KNOW HAVING ANY KIND OF

01:20:54.015 --> 01:20:54.416
INSTRUCTION MOTHER IN

01:20:54.482 --> 01:20:56.418
QUARANTINE- THERE SOME

01:20:56.484 --> 01:20:57.352
ADDITIONAL CHANGES THAT WERE

01:20:57.419 --> 01:21:00.055
MADE- SPECIFICALLY AROUND

01:21:00.121 --> 01:21:03.925
EXTENDING- SUBSTITUTE TEACHER-

01:21:03.992 --> 01:21:05.093
AT THE ABILITY FOR SUCH A

01:21:05.160 --> 01:21:05.694
TEACHER TO TEACH IN A SINGLE

01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:07.896

SIXTY DAYS IN RECOGNITION BALK-

01:21:09.331 --> 01:21:11.399
HER EXPERIENCING A- SHORTAGE

THROUGHOUT THE STATE- AS WELL

01:21:13.134 --> 01:21:14.569
AS SOME OTHER. TECHNICAL

01:21:14.636 --> 01:21:17.038
CHANGES- BUT HAPPY TO ANSWER

01:21:17.105 --> 01:21:18.473
ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE ON

01:21:18.540 --> 01:21:20.108
ON THE SO I GUESS THAT TO JUMP

01:21:20.175 --> 01:21:21.610
INTO THE SPECIFIC THERE'S

01:21:21.676 --> 01:21:23.645
LIMITATIONS TO THAT TO THE G.

01:21:23.712 --> 01:21:25.814
J. THIRTEEN PROCESS WRITINGS

01:21:25.880 --> 01:21:26.581
EIGHT THAT THAT'S CLEARLY

01:21:26.648 --> 01:21:33.755
OUTLINED WHICH ALLOWS- SCHOOL

01:21:33.822 --> 01:21:34.856
DISTRICTS TO- TELL ASK REFLECTS.

01:21:34.923 --> 01:21:36.825
DO TO A NORMALLY ITS USE FOR-

01:21:36.891 --> 01:21:38.660
NETTED DISASTERS OTHER THINGS

01:21:38.727 --> 01:21:40.195
RIGHT WAS THE J. THIRTEEN

01:21:40.262 --> 01:21:41.830
PROCESS NOT WORKING TO THE

01:21:41.896 --> 01:21:43.164
POINT WHERE YOU NEED TO MAKE

01:21:43.231 --> 01:21:44.299
THESE CHANGES YOU WOULD THINK

01:21:44.366 --> 01:21:46.735
THAT. A PANDEMIC WOULD ALSO BE

01:21:46.801 --> 01:21:49.371
A REASON WHY SCHOOL DISTRICTS

01:21:49.437 --> 01:21:49.871
WE USED TO DATE THIRTEEN

01:21:49.938 --> 01:21:53.241
PROCESS. CERTAINLY SO- THE

01:21:53.308 --> 01:21:54.576
REASON WHY WE MADE THAT CHANGE

01:21:54.643 --> 01:21:56.978
WAS LESS ABOUT- SOMETHING NOT

01:21:57.045 --> 01:21:57.912
WORKING A MORE ABOUT PROVIDING

01:21:57.979 --> 01:22:00.081
CLARITY. AND TO THE EDUCATION

01:22:00.148 --> 01:22:02.951
FIELD- AND THEN ALSO INSURING

01:22:03.018 --> 01:22:04.119
THAT WE'RE NOT DISINCENTIVE

01:22:04.185 --> 01:22:05.420
FIGHTING THE PRODUCTION OF

01:22:05.487 --> 01:22:07.188
INDEPENDENT STUDY SOME KIND OF.

01:22:07.255 --> 01:22:08.523
INSTRUCTIONAL CONTINUITY WHILE

01:22:08.590 --> 01:22:10.659
STUDENTS ARE I'M CURRENTLY IN

01:22:10.725 --> 01:22:13.428
FOR COVE IT SO IN THAT THE G.

01:22:13.495 --> 01:22:14.229
THIRTEEN A PROCESS FOR THOSE

01:22:14.296 --> 01:22:17.432
WHO ARE UNFAMILIAR IS- L. I. IT

01:22:17.499 --> 01:22:20.168
AWAY THAT- SCHOOLS CAN. RE

01:22:20.235 --> 01:22:21.836
CAPTURE AN AVERAGE DAILY

01:22:21.903 --> 01:22:23.104
ATTENDANCE THAT'S LOST DURING

01:22:23.171 --> 01:22:25.440
TIMES OF EMERGENCY- SCHOOLS ARE

01:22:25.507 --> 01:22:28.043
NOT REQUIRED TO. PROVIDE ANY

01:22:28.109 --> 01:22:29.577
SORT OF INSTRUCTION IN ORDER TO

01:22:29.644 --> 01:22:30.679
RECAP FOR THE EIGHTY EIGHT

01:22:30.745 --> 01:22:32.947
JUST- SIMPLY TO IDENTIFY THAT

01:22:33.014 --> 01:22:34.516
THERE IS AN EMERGENCY. SO THE

01:22:34.582 --> 01:22:35.717
PURPOSE OF THE CHANGES THERE

01:22:35.784 --> 01:22:37.285
WAS TO CLARIFY THAT THE G.

01:22:37.352 --> 01:22:38.687
THIRTEEN EIGHTY- IS NOT

01:22:38.753 --> 01:22:41.423
APPROPRIATE IN. THE CASE OF

01:22:41.489 --> 01:22:43.458
KOPET- QUARANTINE BECAUSE THE

01:22:43.525 --> 01:22:45.260
STATE IS GIVING A LOCAL

01:22:45.327 --> 01:22:46.628
EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES THE

01:22:46.695 --> 01:22:48.563
ABILITY TO EARN. THAT

01:22:48.630 --> 01:22:50.498
INDEPENDENT STUDY CREDIT THE

01:22:50.565 --> 01:22:50.932
EIGHTY EIGHT THROUGH

01:22:50.999 --> 01:22:54.502
INDEPENDENT STUDY- ED. AS A

01:22:54.569 --> 01:22:55.470
SPECIFIED AND THE OTHER

01:22:55.537 --> 01:22:57.472
SECTIONS OF THIS BILL SB ONE

01:22:57.539 --> 01:22:59.207
SIXTY SEVEN. SO SCHOOLS DON'T

01:22:59.274 --> 01:23:00.775
HAVE SCHOOLS HAVE AN

01:23:00.842 --> 01:23:01.443
OPPORTUNITY TO EARN THAT

01:23:01.509 --> 01:23:05.213
CREDIT- REGARDLESS OF. THE G.

01:23:05.280 --> 01:23:05.714
THIRTEEN PROCESS THAT'S

01:30:05.566 --> 01:30:06.033
SOMEONE WITHIN DEPARTMENT

01:30:06.100 --> 01:30:08.069
FINANCE IS IT SOMEONE WITHIN

01:30:08.136 --> 01:30:10.471
THAT RESOURCES ARE WHO IS OR

01:30:10.538 --> 01:30:12.240
WHO OR WHAT ENTITY IS TASKED.

01:30:12.306 --> 01:30:14.542
TO TRACK ALL THIS FUNDING AND

01:30:14.609 --> 01:30:15.143
TO TRACK THE METRICS OF WHAT'S

01:30:15.209 --> 01:30:19.413
BEING USED FOR. I BELIEVE UNDER

01:30:19.480 --> 01:30:22.183
THE TRAILER BILL IT IDENTIFIED

01:30:22.250 --> 01:30:24.619
AS THE NATURALRESOURCE AGENCY

01:30:24.685 --> 01:30:26.487
WHO WOULD TRACK AND MONITOR OR

01:30:26.554 --> 01:30:27.588
WHO WOULD COLLECT THE

01:30:27.655 --> 01:30:29.423
INFORMATION I THINK THAT'S- HOW

01:30:29.490 --> 01:30:30.892
THE KIND OF ENTITY THAT WE

01:30:30.958 --> 01:30:33.261
FRAMED AS AS THE- ENTITY THAT

01:30:33.327 --> 01:30:34.729
WOULD GATHER THE INFORMATION TO

01:30:34.796 --> 01:30:36.764
THEM TO THE ANNUAL REPORTING.

01:30:36.831 --> 01:30:37.532
THAT WE'RE PUTTING INTO THE

01:30:37.598 --> 01:30:39.367
TRAILER BILL BUT AGAIN LIKE FOR

01:30:39.433 --> 01:30:41.435
EVERY INDIVIDUAL PROGRAM YOU

01:30:41.502 --> 01:30:42.270
KNOW YOU HAVE THE DIFFERENT

01:30:42.336 --> 01:30:44.405
DEPARTMENTS- WARD MINISTERING

01:30:44.472 --> 01:30:46.174
THE PROGRAMMED AND SO EVERY

01:30:46.240 --> 01:30:47.175
DEPARTMENTS ULTIMATELY

01:30:47.241 --> 01:30:48.509
RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR OWN

01:30:48.576 --> 01:30:50.178
PROGRAMS BUT IT'S CAUGHT FIRE

01:30:50.244 --> 01:30:51.712
WAS PART OF THAT FISH AND

01:30:51.779 --> 01:30:52.713
WILDLIFE COULDN'T EVERYBODY

01:30:52.780 --> 01:30:54.949
HAS. GOT DIFFERENT PIZZA THAT

01:30:55.016 --> 01:30:57.618
THE LARGER PUZZLE- I THINK IN

01:30:57.685 --> 01:30:59.020
TERMS OF THE KIND OF OLD-

01:30:59.086 --> 01:31:00.388
REPORTING IT WOULD BE THAT

01:31:00.454 --> 01:31:03.191
NECTARIES AGENCY AS- THE LEAD

01:31:03.257 --> 01:31:04.458
OVER I THINK THE MAJORITY THE

01:31:04.525 --> 01:31:06.327
DEPARTMENT. THIS FUNDING THAT

01:31:06.394 --> 01:31:07.995
WOULD GATHER THIS INFORMATION

01:31:08.062 --> 01:31:10.798
TO DO THAT MORNING. I HAD I

01:31:10.865 --> 01:31:11.732
APPRECIATE THAT THERE ARE A LOT

01:31:11.799 --> 01:31:12.967
AGENCIES INVOLVED I THINK THAT

01:31:13.034 --> 01:31:14.101
THAT'S THE CONCERN THAT I HAVE

01:31:14.168 --> 01:31:15.136
AND MAYBE THAT SOME OF THE

01:31:15.203 --> 01:31:16.404
MEMBERS THAT REPRESENT AREAS

01:31:16.470 --> 01:31:17.338
THAT ARE ON THAT ARE ON FIRE

01:31:17.405 --> 01:31:18.840
RIGHT NOW IS THAT. THAT

01:31:18.906 --> 01:31:19.807
COORDINATION IS EXTREMELY

01:31:19.874 --> 01:31:20.875
IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:31:20.942 --> 01:31:22.443
THINGS ARE BEING DONE AND SO WE

01:31:22.510 --> 01:31:23.878
DON'T WANT THE LEFT HANDED NOT

01:31:23.945 --> 01:31:24.812
NOT KNOW WHAT THE RIGHT HAND IS

01:31:24.879 --> 01:31:30.618
DOING. SO. AND THAT I THINK

01:31:30.685 --> 01:31:31.752
THAT'S WHY- HAVING AN- OR SOME.

01:31:31.819 --> 01:31:32.887
TASKED WITH TRACKING ALL THIS

01:31:32.954 --> 01:31:33.754
AND COORDINATING IT SO THAT

01:31:33.821 --> 01:31:35.523
THERE AREN'T ANY BLIND SPOTS.

01:31:35.590 --> 01:31:36.724
ASSEMBLY THAT'S EXTREMELY

01:31:36.791 --> 01:31:37.859
IMPORTAT TO ME THAT WE WOULD

01:31:37.925 --> 01:31:42.930
ASK FOR- MOVING FORWARD- I KNOW

01:31:42.997 --> 01:31:46.467
I AM- I'M GONNA GOING BACK TO

01:31:46.534 --> 01:31:48.669
DROUGHT AND WATER STORAGE BUT-

01:31:48.736 --> 01:31:50.338
CAN I ASK ADMINISTRATION WHAT

01:31:50.404 --> 01:31:54.008
IS THE STICKING POINT. FOR YOU

01:31:54.075 --> 01:31:57.345
ALL IN TERMS OF WHY. THERE

01:31:57.411 --> 01:32:00.448
ISN'T MORE OF A DESIRE FOR

01:32:00.514 --> 01:32:01.515
WATER STORAGE IS THERE

01:32:01.582 --> 01:32:02.783
SOMETHING SPECIFIC THAT YOU

01:32:02.850 --> 01:32:05.253
GUYS DON'T WANT. OR WHAT WHAT

01:32:05.319 --> 01:32:06.888
IS WHAT'S THE WHAT'S THE

01:32:06.954 --> 01:32:07.455
PREDICT WHAT'S THE SPECIFIC

01:32:07.521 --> 01:32:12.793
STICKING POINT. SO I'M NOT

01:32:12.860 --> 01:32:13.961
TRACKING ANY PARTICULAR

01:32:14.028 --> 01:32:15.296
STICKING POINT OTHER THAN THE

01:32:15.363 --> 01:32:16.564
FACT THAT THERE'S TWO POINT

01:32:16.631 --> 01:32:17.565
SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS THAT IS

01:32:17.632 --> 01:32:19.333
GOING TO BE GOING OUT FOR THE

01:32:19.400 --> 01:32:21.903
SEVEN LARGE PROJECTS THAT ARE

01:32:21.969 --> 01:32:22.837
ARE GONNA BE IMPLEMENTED OVER

01:32:22.904 --> 01:32:25.406
THE- NEXT FEW YEARS YOU KNOW

01:32:25.473 --> 01:32:25.907
THAT ARE CURRENTLY GOING

01:32:25.973 --> 01:32:27.742
THROUGH THE APPROVAL PROCESS.

01:32:27.808 --> 01:32:28.709
TO GIVE THAT THERE'S AB TWO

01:32:28.776 --> 01:32:29.744
POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS

01:32:29.810 --> 01:32:31.279
BILLION DOLLARS THERE'S A LOT

01:32:31.345 --> 01:32:33.180
OF DIFFERENT NEEDS AND THE

01:32:33.247 --> 01:32:34.615
WATERS BASED ON DEMONSTRATION

01:32:34.682 --> 01:32:36.918
PUT OUT- IN TWENTY TWENTY THE

01:32:36.984 --> 01:32:38.286
WATER IS GOING PORTFOLIO WHICH

01:32:38.352 --> 01:32:39.553
BASICALLY HAVE A PORTFOLIO

01:32:39.620 --> 01:32:41.956
STRATEGIES- TO BUILD UP MORE

01:32:42.023 --> 01:32:43.357
RESILIENCE IN OUR IN OUR WATER

01:32:43.424 --> 01:32:45.226
SYSTEM WORKING WITH LOCALS AND-

01:32:45.293 --> 01:32:47.495
AND PARTNERSHIPS AND SO- YOU

01:32:47.561 --> 01:32:48.596
JUST ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THERE'S

01:32:48.663 --> 01:32:50.364
A LOT OF. DIFFERENT PROGRAMS

01:32:50.431 --> 01:32:51.999
THAT THEY HAVE A NEED AND

01:32:52.066 --> 01:32:53.367
THERE'S ALREADY TWO POINT SEVEN

01:32:53.434 --> 01:32:55.403
BILLION DOLLARS THAT IS- SET

01:32:55.469 --> 01:32:57.838
ASIDE FOR WATER STORAGE THOUGH-

01:32:57.905 --> 01:32:59.273
I DON'T THINK ANY PARTICULAR

01:32:59.340 --> 01:33:01.242
STICKING POINT HAVE O WHY. WHY

01:33:01.309 --> 01:33:02.843
NOT MORE OTHER THAN A TWO POINT

01:33:02.910 --> 01:33:04.812
SEVEN BILLION THAT IS CURRENTLY

01:33:04.879 --> 01:33:05.980
SET UP SO LET ME COMPARE MY

01:33:06.047 --> 01:33:07.515
LIST WITH YOUR LIST WHAT I THE

01:33:07.581 --> 01:33:08.616
SEVEN PROJECTS THAT YOU HAVE

01:33:08.683 --> 01:33:12.720
PENDING BEFORE. THE WATER

01:33:12.787 --> 01:33:18.025
COMMISSION. SO THE CHINO BASIN

01:33:18.092 --> 01:33:20.661
USED ENVIRONMENTAL STORAGE THE

01:33:20.728 --> 01:33:25.199
HARDEST WATER PROGRAM. THE KERN-

01:33:25.266 --> 01:33:27.802
BROADER WATER STORAGE PROGRAM

01:33:27.868 --> 01:33:29.737
THE LOCALES RATHER FOR THE

01:33:29.804 --> 01:33:32.673
CHECK A RATHER WARM SITES

01:33:32.740 --> 01:33:34.508
RESERVOIR AND WILLOW SPRINGS.

01:33:34.575 --> 01:33:36.477
SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT AFTER THE

01:33:36.544 --> 01:33:37.912
TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS

01:33:37.979 --> 01:33:39.880
IS ALLOCATED ASSUMING IT

01:33:39.947 --> 01:33:42.683
HAPPENS- THAT THESE SEVEN

01:33:42.750 --> 01:33:44.585
PROJECTS ARE GOING TO BECOME

01:33:44.652 --> 01:33:48.489
FULLY COMPLETED OPERATIONAL. IF

01:33:48.556 --> 01:33:49.690
THEY RECEIVE ALL THE

01:33:49.757 --> 01:33:52.059
APPROPRIATE APPROVALS AND THE-

01:33:52.126 --> 01:33:53.527
OTHER FINANCING MECHANISMS

01:33:53.594 --> 01:33:54.295
WHICH IS PART OF ONE OF THE

01:33:54.362 --> 01:33:56.364
REQUIREMENTS THERE AND I MEAN

01:33:56.430 --> 01:33:58.332
AT LEAST WE COULD SAY IS THE

01:33:58.399 --> 01:33:59.467
TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS

01:33:59.533 --> 01:34:01.635
IS WOULD BE SET ASIDE FOR THE

01:34:01.702 --> 01:34:03.471
PROJECT. BUT AGAIN THESE ARE

01:34:03.537 --> 01:34:05.873
NOT YOU KNOW STATE RUN PROJECTS

01:34:05.940 --> 01:34:07.341
THE WOULD BE RUN BY THE LOCAL

01:34:07.408 --> 01:34:09.977
WATER DISTRICTS AS- ULTIMATELY

01:34:10.044 --> 01:34:12.213
YOU KNOW THE PIECE DOES DEPEND

01:34:12.279 --> 01:34:15.116
ON ON THE SPEED OF THESE LOCAL

01:34:15.182 --> 01:34:16.584
IMPLEMENTERS TO GET THE PROJECT

01:34:16.650 --> 01:34:18.619
DONE AS A WE CAN ACTUALLY SPEAK

01:34:18.686 --> 01:34:21.889
ON. ON BEHALF OF- KIND OF THE

01:34:21.956 --> 01:34:24.191
FEEDER OR WHETHER THE KIND OF

01:34:24.258 --> 01:34:28.396
LOCAL WILL WILL GET IT DONE BUT

01:34:28.462 --> 01:34:29.030
THESE ARE LOCALLY RUN PROJECTS.

01:34:29.096 --> 01:34:30.364
WITH A UV GOT A COULD YOU WOULD

01:34:30.431 --> 01:34:31.265
ON DAHLE THOUGH THAT FOR

01:34:31.332 --> 01:34:35.403
EXAMPLE THERE ARE- CONVEYANCE

01:34:35.469 --> 01:34:36.837
FACILITIES AND OTHER PROJECTS

01:34:36.904 --> 01:34:38.139
THAT ALSO NEED TO BE DONE TO

01:34:38.205 --> 01:34:39.740
HELP MOVE THE WATER AROUND I

01:34:39.807 --> 01:34:42.643
MEAN I GUESS MY I GUESS I'M

01:34:42.710 --> 01:34:43.577
HARPING ON THIS BECAUSE THIS

01:34:43.644 --> 01:34:45.479
IS. THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE FACING

01:34:45.546 --> 01:34:47.748
THE CENTRAL VALLEY- YOU KNOW I

01:34:47.815 --> 01:34:49.383
DRIVE THE FIVE NINE NINE I DID

01:34:49.450 --> 01:34:51.318
I DID IT YESTERDAY. I MEAN

01:34:51.385 --> 01:34:53.020
IT'S- THERE'S DEVASTATION

01:34:53.087 --> 01:34:55.089
HAPPENING. ALONG IN THERE IN

01:34:55.156 --> 01:34:57.324
THE CENTER VALLEY- TREES ARE

01:34:57.391 --> 01:34:59.326
BEING UPROOTED THERE'S JUST

01:34:59.393 --> 01:35:01.062
IT'S JUST. IT'S A VERY

01:35:01.128 --> 01:35:02.963
DEPRESSING DR WHEN YOU SEE THAT

01:35:03.030 --> 01:35:04.398
THAT THE DEVASTATION OF THIS

01:35:04.465 --> 01:35:06.367
DROUGHT. AND SO I JUST DON'T

01:35:06.434 --> 01:35:07.935
UNDERSTAND IF YOU'RE TELLING ME

01:35:08.002 --> 01:35:09.370
THAT IS STILL STICKING POINTS

01:35:09.437 --> 01:35:10.171
BETWEEN WITH THE ADMINISTRATION

01:35:10.237 --> 01:35:12.239
OVER AROUND. CONVENIENCE AND

01:35:12.306 --> 01:35:15.376
WATER STORAGE. THERE HAS TO BE

01:35:15.443 --> 01:35:16.510
BECAUSE YOU CLEARLY ARE NOT

01:35:16.577 --> 01:35:18.112
INVESTING ANY MONEY IN THIS

01:35:18.179 --> 01:35:21.715
BUDGET FOR THAT. THE BUDGET

01:35:21.782 --> 01:35:22.850
DOES INCLUDE TWO HUNDRED

01:35:22.917 --> 01:35:23.784
MILLION DOLLARS FOR A

01:35:23.851 --> 01:35:25.719
CONVEYANCE AND IF I COULD SPEAK

01:35:25.786 --> 01:35:26.520
TO A LITTLE BIT TO OTHER

01:35:26.587 --> 01:35:28.422
PROGRAMS THAT ALSO THE FOR THE

01:35:28.489 --> 01:35:29.657
CENTRAL VALLEY WHICH- YOU KNOW

01:35:29.723 --> 01:35:30.858
WE'RE PUTTING A LOT OF FUNDING

01:35:30.925 --> 01:35:32.660
INTO SIGMA AND HIS BUDGET.

01:35:32.726 --> 01:35:35.129
WHICH WE KNOW YOU KNOW- THAT

01:35:35.196 --> 01:35:36.197
CRITICALLY OVER DRAFTED BASED

01:35:36.263 --> 01:35:38.532
IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY- ARE ARE

01:35:38.599 --> 01:35:40.501
SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED- MORE

01:35:40.568 --> 01:35:41.769
FUNDING FOR A WATER RECYCLING

01:35:41.836 --> 01:35:43.471
WHICH PROVIDES A GREATER SO A

01:35:43.537 --> 01:35:44.839
PLAN RIGHT WILL THE LIABILITY

01:35:44.905 --> 01:35:47.675
OF WATER- OPERA GROUNDWATER

01:35:47.741 --> 01:35:49.443
CLEANUP WHICH WE KNOW IS ALSO

01:35:49.510 --> 01:35:50.878
AN ISSUE ACROSS THE STATE AND

01:35:50.945 --> 01:35:52.346
ALSO IN THE- CENTRAL VALLEY

01:35:52.413 --> 01:35:53.414
THERE'S- IMMEDIATE ROUTE

01:35:53.481 --> 01:35:54.715
SUPPORT THAT WE'RE DOING FOR

01:35:54.782 --> 01:35:56.617
THOSE. COUNTIES VISITED ME

01:35:56.684 --> 01:35:57.852
PRIMARILY TO THAT ARE IMPACTED

01:35:57.918 --> 01:35:59.453
BY DROUGHT WHICH WE KNOW MANY

01:35:59.520 --> 01:36:01.555
ARE IN CENTRAL VALLEY AND SO I

01:36:01.622 --> 01:36:02.823
WOULD SAY THIS BUDGET AS A

01:36:02.890 --> 01:36:04.225
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY

01:36:04.291 --> 01:36:06.961
THAT- SUPPORT- GROWL AND THOSE

01:36:07.027 --> 01:36:08.896
COMMUNITIES MOST IN NEED- IN

01:36:08.963 --> 01:36:10.764
ADDITION TO COMMANDS WHICH IS

01:36:10.831 --> 01:36:11.298
WHAT YOU'RE A TWO HUNDRED

01:36:11.365 --> 01:36:14.468
MILLION DOLLARS. SO OKAY IS A I

01:36:14.535 --> 01:36:16.403
MEAN. YOU HAVE TO A MILLION

01:36:16.470 --> 01:36:17.838
DOLLARS IN COMMANDS I GUESS

01:36:17.905 --> 01:36:18.606
THIS IS NOT GOING TO CONVINCE

01:36:18.672 --> 01:36:19.840
FOR THE MOMENT. A HUNDRED

01:36:19.907 --> 01:36:21.942
MILLION DOLLARS FOR THIS YEAR A

01:36:22.009 --> 01:36:22.476
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AS

01:36:22.543 --> 01:36:24.678
PROMISED HOPEFULLY PINKY SWEAR

01:36:24.745 --> 01:36:27.615
NEXT YEAR- BUT THERE'S SEVEN

01:36:27.681 --> 01:36:28.549
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS WORTH

01:36:28.616 --> 01:36:29.517
OF WORK ON THE COMES A

01:36:29.583 --> 01:36:35.256
CONVEYANCE. SO YOU DON'T EVEN

01:36:35.322 --> 01:36:35.890
FINISH THE CONVEYANCE WORK. YES

01:36:35.956 --> 01:36:38.192
A PART OF THE BILL LANGUAGE OUT

TO A NON STATE COST SHARE AND

01:36:43.297 --> 01:36:44.532
ALSO DEPENDING ON THE PROJECTS

SAFEGUARDS TO AVOID NEGATIVE

01:44:09.443 --> 01:44:10.644
IMPACTS AND THERE'S NO EVIDENCE

01:44:10.711 --> 01:44:12.512
THAT SEQUEL HAS BEEN AN

01:44:12.579 --> 01:44:14.481
IMPEDIMENT TO WELL PLANNED

THIS EXEMPTION IN THIS BILL

01:44:19.519 --> 01:44:21.121

THE FUEL CELL TWO YEAR

01:44:32.499 --> 01:44:36.370
EXTENSION. THERE IS IT I THINK

01:44:36.436 --> 01:44:38.238
IT UNDERMINES THE PAST PAT

01:44:38.305 --> 01:44:39.906

EACH TIME THAT THIS PROGRAM IS

THE UEL CELL EMISSIONS

01:44:53.253 --> 01:44:56.456

01:44:56.523 --> 01:44:59.493
EXTENSION- IS IGNORING A OUR

01:44:59.559 --> 01:45:01.628

EIGHTY I BELIEVE WHICH WOULD

01:52:55.768 --> 01:52:56.970

DISCONNECTED BECAUSE OF THE

02:03:59.331 --> 02:04:00.800
CONTAMINATION OF PEAPOD'S WHICH

02:04:00.866 --> 02:04:01.634
MEANS WE'RE RELYING ON MORE

02:04:01.700 --> 02:04:03.402
IMPORTED WATER. IN BECOMING

02:04:03.469 --> 02:04:04.670
LESS DROUGHT RESILIENT IN

02:04:04.737 --> 02:04:05.604

CONTINUE TO. HELP COMMUNITIES

02:04:27.459 --> 02:04:28.627
LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES CAN

AFFORD TO DO THAT THEMSELVES TO

02:04:30.496 --> 02:04:31.430

BASE- THE EDUCATION CLEAN UP

02:04:53.619 --> 02:04:55.654
BILLS HEARING I KNOW. MISTER

02:04:55.721 --> 02:04:57.122
VICE CHAIR MENTIONED THAT WE

02:04:57.189 --> 02:04:59.024
HAVE MULTIPLE. BUDGET BILL

02:04:59.091 --> 02:05:00.659
JUNIORS BUT I THINK THAT'S

02:05:00.726 --> 02:05:02.728
BEING RESPONSIBLE BECAUSE WE'RE

02:05:02.795 --> 02:05:03.863
IN A GLOBAL PANDEMIC. IT'S

02:05:03.929 --> 02:05:04.763
REALLY HARD PUTTING KIDDING

02:05:04.830 --> 02:05:06.699
KIDS BACK TO SCHOOL. I THINK

02:05:06.765 --> 02:05:08.300
LOUD AND CLEAR HERE LAST YEAR

02:05:08.367 --> 02:05:09.969
WE REALIZE THAT ZOOM SCHOOL.

02:05:10.035 --> 02:05:11.737
DID NOT WORK ESPECIALLY FOR SO

02:05:11.804 --> 02:05:13.439
MANY COMMUNITIES. WHO DON'T

02:05:13.505 --> 02:05:15.574
HAVE ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY. STAY

02:05:15.641 --> 02:05:16.876
AT HOME PARENTS WHO CAN STAY ON

02:05:16.942 --> 02:05:19.378
TOP OF THEIR KIDS. THE THIS IS

02:05:19.445 --> 02:05:22.014
LEARNING LOS IT'S YOU KNOW.

02:05:22.081 --> 02:05:23.515
NINE LOS BECAUSE THAT LEARNING

02:05:23.582 --> 02:05:24.783
NEVER HAPPEN THE FIRST PLACE

02:05:24.850 --> 02:05:27.686
AND SO. OUR DEFAULT IS GOING

02:05:27.753 --> 02:05:29.021
BACK TO SCHOOL AND I THINK

02:05:29.088 --> 02:05:31.390
THAT- THE CLARIFICATIONS HERE

02:05:31.457 --> 02:05:34.293
ON INDEPENDENT STUDY. ARE ARE

02:05:34.360 --> 02:05:36.495
