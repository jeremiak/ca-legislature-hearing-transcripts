NO PROBLEM GET AFTERNOON HERE FOR YOU AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND KIMBERLY HARBISON FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. AND I'M JOINED BY MEMBERS OF THE FINANCE TEAM AS WELL AS COLLEAGUES FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS PUBLIC HEALTH AND FOOD AND AGRICULTURE. THANK YOU FOR INVITING US HERE TODAY TO TALK WITH YOU ABOUT THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL TO CONSOLIDATE THE LICENSING AND REGULATORY OVERSIGHT FUNCTIONS. OF COMMERCIAL A COMMERCIAL CANNABIS ACTIVITY IN CALIFORNIA INTO A SINGLE DEPARTMENT. THE PROPOSAL INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WILL CREATE THE DEPARTMENT OF CANNABIS CONTROL WITHIN THE BUSINESS CONSUMER SERVICES AND HOUSING AGENCY. EFFECTIVE JULY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY ONE. CREATING ONE POINT OF CONTACT WILL BETTER SERVE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS LICENSES AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS BY MAKING SURE THEY RECEIVE CONCISE AND CONSISTENT GUIDANCE FROM THE STATE. THE PROPOSAL AIMS TO SIMPLIFY PARTICIPATION IN THE LEGAL MARKET AND SUPPORT THE SUCCESSFUL AND SAFE OPERATION OF CANNABIS BUSINESSES IN COMPLIANCE WITH STATE LAW. ESTABLISHMENT OF A SINGLE DEPARTMENT WILL REMOVE REDUNDANCIES PARTICULARLY AROUND LICENSING AND COMPLIANCE PROCESSES. AND THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE LICENSING IS PROVING TO BE A CHALLENGING BARRIER TO ENTRY. FOR SMALL BUSINESS OPERATORS AS WELL AS VERTICALLY INTEGRATED COMPANIES. FIXING ENFORCEMENT UNDER ONE DEPARTMENT WILL NEED TO APPROVE YOU FOR SOME COORDINATION AND CREATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE STATE'S MORE EFFECTIVELY APPLY ITS RESOURCES. BUT TO BETTER PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH SAFETY AND LANDS SIMPLIFY PARTNERSHIPS WITH LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AND ULTIMATELY MAKE IT MORE COSTLY AND INEFFICIENT TO PARTICIPATE IN IT ILLICIT CANNABIS INDUSTRY. WE KNOW THAT A STRONG LOCAL MARKET AND LOCAL PARTICIPATION REDUCES THE ILLEGAL MARKET HAVING ONE DEPARTMENT WILL SIMPLIFY THE STATE'S ADMINISTRATION REGULATING CANNABIS AND THIS WILL A LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. IN UNDERSTANDING THE STATE FRAMEWORK AND BEING MORE WILLING TO ADOPT THAT FRAMEWORK IN THE RESPECTIVE LOCALITIES. ONE OF THE FIRST TASK OF THE NEW DEPARTMENT WILL BE TO HARMONIZE. WITH THREE SETS OF EXISTING REGULATIONS INTO ONE. OPERATING OFF OF ONCE THAT WILL MAKE IT EASIER FOR INDUSTRY. TO NAVIGATE AND THE STATE WILL HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE IMPACTS OUTCOMES OF THE STATE REGULATORY EFFORTS REMOTE MORE UNIFORM DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS. THIS WILL INVOLVE CONSOLIDATION RECONCILIATION AND STREAMLINING WHERE APPROPRIATE. WHAT CREATES THE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THE NEW DEPARTMENT LARGELY BY MOVING POSITIONS IN FUNDING THAT ARE CURRENTLY SUPPORTING THE THREE EXISTENCE EXISTING STATE CANNABIS LICENSING ENTITIES TO THE NEW DEPARTMENT ON JULY FIRST. WE HAVE IDENTIFIED THE ACTIVITIES OF THE THREE CURRENT LICENSING AUTHORITIES CAN. IN THEM UNDER NINE DIVISIONS AS DESCRIBED IN THE BUDGET CHANCE PROPOSAL IS THE RESIDENTS ARE IT CASTRATION COMPLIANCE ENFORCEMENT. EXTERNAL PARTNERS I THINK LABORATORY. LEGAL AFFAIRS DESPITE AFFAIRS AND LICENSING. THE BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL REQUESTS SIX HUNDRED TWENTY ONE POSITIONS AND ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THREE POINT EIGHT MILLION IN CANNABIS CONTROL FUND IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. AND THAT AMOUNT WILL DECREASE% TO ONE HUNDRED THIRTY SIX POINT SIX MILLION IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE AND I'M GOING. OF THE HUNDRED FIFTY THREE POINT EIGHT NINE REQUESTED ONLY THREE POINT TWO MILLION IS NEW FUNDING TO ESTABLISH THE NEW DEPARTMENT. THE OTHER ONE HUNDRED FIFTY POINT SEVEN MILLION. IT'S FROM THE EXISTING DEPARTMENTS. WE'LL FOCUS ON CONTINUITY AND STABILITY FOR STAKEHOLDERS DURING THE TRANSITION THROUGH THE CONTINUED USE OF THE CURRENT LICENSING SYSTEMS AND THE CALIFORNIA CANNABIS TRACK AND TRACE SYSTEM. AS WELL AS TO INTERAGENCY AGREEMENTS. WHAT THE EXISTING DEPARTMENTS FOR ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES WHILE WE WORK TO STAND UP THE NEW DEPARTMENT OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS. THE FUNDING DECREASE THE AMOUNT THAT I MENTIONED ABOUT FOR TWENTY TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE REFLECTS THE PHASE OUT. OF THOSE INTERAGENCY AGREEMENTS. THANK LIKE ONE OF THE SIX HUNDRED TWENTY ONE REQUESTED POSITIONS ONLY TWENTY THREE ARE NEW AND THE REST ARE CURRENTLY AUTHORIZED WITHIN THE THREE LICENSING ENTITIES. CHANCE FOR A FIVE HUNDRED NINETY EIGHT EXISTING POSITIONS WILL ALLOW THE NEW DEPARTMENT TO RETAIN THE KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERTISE. THAT RESIDE WITHIN THESE PROGRAMS TODAY. THE TWENTY THREE NEW POSITIONS ARE NEEDED TO FORM THE EXECUTIVE MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE OF THE NEW DEPARTMENT AND IT'S CONSISTENT WITH OTHER STATE DEPARTMENTS OF SIMILAR SIZE. THESE POSITIONS WILL PROVIDE SOME ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS CURRENTLY PERFORMED WITHIN THE THREE EXISTING DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE NOT SPECIFIC TO CANNABIS. AND WILL REMAIN AT THE LEGACY DEPARTMENTS SUCH AS AN EEO OFFICER. AND A CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICER. ON THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES IT INCLUDES COMPANION PROPOSALS FROM CONSUMER AFFAIRS PUBLIC HEALTH AND FOOD AND AGRICULTURE TO TRANSFER THE RESPECTIVE CANADA'S RESOURCES TO THE NEW DEPARTMENT- WE HAVE ALSO PROPOSED STATUTORY CHANGES TO EFFECTUATE THE CONSOLIDATION AND MAKE RELATED IMPROVEMENTS WHERE POSSIBLE. ONE ITEM OF NOTE FOR THE COMMITTEE IS THE- DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND ACT WILL RETAIN THAT CAN APPELLATIONS. THE- CAL BROKE WHICH WILL ESTABLISH FOR CANNABIS. COMPARABLE TO THE NEXT ORGANIC PROGRAM WILL ALSO BE WRITTEN WITHIN AND AFTER AND THE DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH. AND WILL CONTINUE BENEFIT EXPERT MOST. THANKS WE WOULD LIKE TO THE THIS PROPOSED IS THE FIRST STEP IN MOVING TOWARD UNIFIED APPROACH TO CANNABIS WITH IN CALIFORNIA. I RECOGNIZE THIS EFFORT WILL REQUIRE ADJUSTMENTS AFTER THE INITIAL ESTABLISHMENT OF THE DEPARTMENT AND IT IS OUR INTENT TO PROVIDE CONTINUITY OF OPERATIONS AND SERVICES DURING THE CONSOLIDATION PERIOD. RETENTION OF EXPERTISE TO THE TRANSFER OF EXISTING POSITIONS. FROM THE THREE STATE CANNABIS ENTITIES THE NEW DEPARTMENTAL EIGHT IN THIS BILL. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND WE'RE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU FOR. MISTER SEIDENBERG. THREE SO TO WORK LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- AT THIS POINT OUR OFFICE IS STILL EXAMINING THE PROPOSAL AND TO THE EXTENT WE IDENTIFY ANY CONCERNS OR HAVE OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING TO IT WILL MAKE SURE TO PROVIDE THOSE TO THE COMMITTEE AS SOON AS THEY BECOME AVAILABLE. THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. WHAT QUESTIONS GO AHEAD MR LIFE. CERTAINLY THE SUB CONSOLIDATION WILL SERVE AS A- I THINK A BENEFIT TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT- I HEARD YOU SAY THAT THERE. THIS MERGES ACTUALLY REDUCED IN- WILL RESULT IN REDUCED REDUNDANCY I DON'T. DON'T KNOW WHERE THAT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING WHEN. USUALLY WHEN THERE'S A CONSOLIDATION THERE'S A REDUCTION IN EMPLOYEES BUT THAT'S NOT THE CASE HERE AS A MATTER OF FACT WE HAVE. SO MORE EMPLOYEES SO IF YOU JUST GOT TO HELP ME UNDERSTAND WHAT REDUNDANCY HAS BEEN. REDUCED BY THIS CONSOLIDATION I WOULD LOVE THAT. I'M SURE THIS IS YEAH I CAN REALLY HAVE RISEN AGAIN FROM FINANCE- WE DEALT. THE WORK WILL STILL SAY THE SAME SO THERE IS NO REDUCTION OF EMPLOYEES BUT THE WHAT WE HOPE TO GAIN AND PLAN TO GAIN FROM THIS CONSOLIDATION. IS STREAMLINING CELL INSTEAD OF THREE SETS OF REGULATIONS THERE'S ONE THERE'S ONE POINT OF CONTACT FOR CONSUMERS. AND BUSINESSES LICENSEES SISTER STATE DEPARTMENT TO CONTACT FOR INFORMATION SO IT'S A- STREAMLINING AND REFINEMENT OF THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING SO INSTEAD OF DOING SOMETHING. THREE TIMES- WE WILL DO UNDER ONE ROOF BUT THERE IS STILL YOU KNOW DIFFERENT ASPECTS TO LICENSING SO WE NEED. ALL THAT KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERTISE IN THE NEW DEPARTMENT. OKAY OKAY THANK YOU I JUST KNOW THAT ADDITIONAL PLACE SOMETIMES HAVE A TENDENCY TO DO JUST THE OPPOSITE OF STREAMLINING SO I'M HOPING THAT YOU CAN FIGURE OUT A WAY TO ACCOMPLISH THAT AND- I HAVE GREAT HOPES. MISTER COOPER. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR OF. THIS IS A QUESTION FOR FINANCE GOING pBACK TO THOSE. TWENTY THREE NEW POSITIONS YOU ANOTHER MINUTE FOR YOU TALKED ABOUT. BUT THEY'RE SEPARATE FROM THE LEGACY POSITIONS A LEGACY AGENCIES. I MEAN HOW MANY HOW MANY ARE MEANT TO SAYS IN IN THE REPORTER SAYS. MANAGEMENT I. T. I BELIEVE. YEAH MANAGEMENT I. T. SO HOW MANY HOW MANY GOING FOR EXECUTIVE POSITIONS ARE MANAGEMENT AND HOW MANY FOR I. T. I'M I'M- OFF TO OUR- BASICALLY EXPERT FROM FOOD AGRICULTURE MELISSA. HI MELISSA IT'S AN WOULD CDFA CAL CANNABIS WE HAVE. IT EXECUTIVE DIVISION WE HAVE FIVE POSITIONS AND THEN IN THE I. T. THERE IS TEN SO THERE'S THOSE ARE FIFTEEN OUT OF THE TWENTY THREE. FIFTEEN NINETY. OH SORRY THERE IS TEN NINETY AND FIVE EXECUTIVE. OKAY LET'S FIFTEEN WHAT WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER TO UP TO TWENTY THREE THURSDAY MORE. SO THAT WE HAVE- WE'RE GOING TO NEED EIGHT INTERNAL- INTERNAL AUDITS OFFICE SO THAT IS ANOTHER ISSUE FOR THEIR AND THEN IN ADDITION WE HAVE AT THREE NEW STAFF IN LICENSING- IN SOME OF THESE ARE FOR SUPPORT POSITIONS OR WHEN WE WERE LOOKING AT THE STRUCTURES. WE THERE WAS SOME LLOCATION ISSUES LIKE WE NEEDED TO HAVE AN ADDITIONAL MANAGER OR- JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE WAS THE RIGHT RATIO BETWEEN EMPLOYEES AND- EMPLOYEES AND MANAGEMENT BUT- LET'S SEE AND THEN IN LABS WE HAVE ONE SUPERVISOR- AND THEN AND- OUR EXTERNAL AFFAIRS WE HAVE ONE OFFICE TECHNICIANS THAT THAT WOULD BE ONE MORE POSITION. TO THAT IT'S THE TWENTY THREE. SO ARE KNOWN FOR BECAUSE CORRECT. CORRECT OKAY LAST TIME WE HAD A FULL HEARING ON CANNABIS CULTIVATION ADMINISTRATION DID ENGAGE WITH THE LEGISLATURE- THE NUTRITION SAID THEY WANTED TO BUT THEY NEVER GOT FEEDBACK FROM US AND WE WANT TO WORK WITH YOU GUYS IN A PARTNERSHIP SO OF THE FIVE HUNDRED AND NINETY EXISTING POSITIONS HOW MANY ARE DEDICATED SOLELY TO ENFORCEMENT. I MEAN IT DEFERRED TO THAT BUT THE- OF CAMPUS CONTROL FOR THAT CAMERA. TALK ABOUT IMPORTANT. CERTAINLY ASSEMBLY MEMBER COOPER TENURE TRYING TO OUR FIRST ONE PIECE OFFICERS ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE INTERESTED IN IT'S HARD TO HEAR ABOUT HEARING IT'S- HELLO CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW. YEAH OKAY LET ME. I'M ARE YOU AND ARE YOU SPECIFICALLY ASKING ABOUT OUR SWORN PEACE OFFICER POSITIONS CORRECT AMONG THE MOST ALL THE AGENTS ARE ACTS. CORRECT SO CURRENTLY THE BUREAU HIS AS YOU KNOW JULY FIRST THE KIND OF THE FIRST MAKING IT CAME OVER FROM DC INTO THE EURO. SO THAT IS GOING TO CARRY OVER INTO THE NEW DEPARTMENT AND CURRENTLY WE HAVE. SEVENTY SIX ONE PHYSICIANS AUTHORIZED. AND THAT WILL BE ON THE NEW NEW AGENCY. THAT IS CORRECT THAT WILL CARRY OVER INTO THE NEW AGENCY. OKAY- SO WHAT CAN YOU TELL ME AS FAR AS THE CURRENT BEEN FORTUNATE POSITIONS WHERE THEY WHERE THEY CURRENTLY DO. SO IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ARE SWORN ENFORCEMENT THEY PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON UNLICENSED ACTIVITY. AND SO THEY YOU KNOW DO ALL THE ACTIVITIES RELATED TO THAT KIND OF AN INVESTIGATION FROM THE ACTIVITY DAYS ARE SEARCH WARRANTS TO CONDUCT SURVEILLANCE THEY WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH OTHER STATE AGENCIES. AND OTHER AND THE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT- AND DEPARTMENTS. SO WITH A NEW AGENCY THEIR POSITIONS WILL REMAIN THE SAME THAT THEIR DUTIES AND. THAT IS CORRECT SIR. DO YOU SEE A NEED FOR INCREASING LAW ENFORCEMENT STAFFING. I THINK WHAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW IT'S APPROPRIATE WE ARE MAKING GOOD PROGRESS ON FILLING THOSE POSITIONS AND SO I THINK OUR PLAN WOULD BE TO. THOSE POSITIONS SEE HOW IT WORKS AND THE CONSOLIDATION AND IF WE DETERMINE THAT WE NEED ADDITIONAL RESOURCES WE WILL CERTAINLY ASK FOR THOSE. I GUESS MY CONCERN IS- THERE'S A LOT OF INVESTIGATION TO DO AN AWFULLY SEVENTY SIX SWORN OFFICERS. OF THE BLACK MARKET IS STILL ALIVE AND WELL LAST YEAR THE SAME COMMITTEE WE TALKED ABOUT THE VAPING DEATHS FROM BLACK MARKET CANNABIS IS STILL OUT THERE- PEOPLE ARE STILL DYING IS KIND OF TAKEN A BACKSEAT BECAUSE OF CODE. BECAUSE COVETOUS SUCKED ALL THE AIR OUT AND RIGHTLY SO WE STILL HAVE AN ISSUE WITH IT. YOU GUYS HAD ONE BIG ARRESTS LAST YEAR DOWN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA A BIG BUST. AND USE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT SO THERE'S NO WAY THAT- DCC. CAN INVESTIGATE THESE CASES WITHOUT LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT SO. I HAVEN'T READ ANYTHING ELSE WHAT YOUR AGENTS HAVE DONE SINCE THEN. CONSERVE NATIONAL BOSTON LA. SO I THANK SAID IS STILL GOING ON THE BLACK MARKET CANNABIS SO. IT WHEN YOU SAY THAT SEVENTY SIX OFFICERS ENOUGH I WONDER ABOUT THAT AND ALSO MORE IMPORTANTLY- THERE'S REALLY BEEN NO ENFORCEMENT BECAUSE THEY WERE SO CONCERNED ABOUT LICENSING. AND GETTING THESE BUSINESSES UP AND RUNNING WHAT WHICH HAPPENED WE GOT UP AND RUNNING BUT AS FAR AS I KNOW. HAVING BILLS COMMITTEE FOR SEVEN YEARS NOW THERE'S BEEN. SUBSTANTIAL LAST THREE OR FOUR YEARS- ENFORCEMENT BECAUSE EVERYONE WAS SO CONCERNED ABOUT LICENSING. SO HAVE THERE BEEN ANY MORE LARGE SCALE BUS DEALING WITH BLACK MARKET- VAPING. SIR I CAN'T SAY SPECIFICALLY DEVELOPING BUT WE CERTAINLY ARE OUT THERE CONDUCTING OPERATIONS- RELATED. ILLEGAL ACTIVITY AND EXECUTING SEARCH WARRANTS AT AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE LOCALS ARE VERY IMPORTANT PIECE OF THIS PUZZLE AND WE WORK WITH VIRTUALLY WITH THEM. IN FACT FIVE INVEST LAST THANKSGIVING FACT LAST WEEK WE EXECUTED A SEARCH WARRANT IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE LA POLICE DEPARTMENT WE ALSO EXECUTED ONE IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE SAN% BERNARDINO POLICE DEPARTMENT. AS WELL AS THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TAX AND FEE ADMINISTRATION SO ALL THREE OF THOSE AGENCIES WERE INVOLVED IN THAT SO WE ARE CONTINUING TO DO THAT AND OUR PLAN IS TO CONTINUE TO DO THAT AS WE- MOVE FORWARD- THROUGH THE CONSOLIDATION. AND HOPEFULLY INCREASE OUR COOPERATION IN THOSE RELATIONSHIPS- TO ATTACK THE ILLEGAL MARKET THROUGH AND ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES SO IT WOULD HELP ME AS FAR AS BEING ON THIS COMMITTEE HAVE FROM A FULL COMMITTEE MEMBERS TO KNOW. HOW TO USE SEARCH WARRANTS HAVE BEEN HAVE BEEN DONE. SINCE A BIG OPERATION LAST YEAR THAT WERE STRICKEN WE TALK ABOUT WILL SEARCH FOR SHE SERVED. WITH ALL STRICTLY FOR BLACK MARKET OVER THERE FOR OTHER CANNABIS. RELATED INVESTIGATIONS. SO WHEN YOU SEPARATING OTHERS. YEAH SEARCH WARRANTS ARE YOU TEAMS FOCUS THEIR PRIMARY FOCUS IS ON THE UNLICENSED ACTIVITY BUT THAT'S NOT TO BE FOR ME SAID LICENSE THAT COULD BE FOR JUST. FOR CANNABIS SOMEONE HEAVILY WILL GROW- SUPPLYING WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT THE CIVIC DEVELOPING BECAUSE OF THE VAPING DOES WE HAVE LAST YEAR. SO CAN I NEED A IT WOULD HELP ME MAKE DECISIONS. IF YOU COULD BREAK THAT OUT INTO LITTLE SPECIFICALLY WORK AND AN ADDRESS THAT WE DEAL WITH THIS. THE FORMER HAVE. FILED HERE I GET AND BE CERTAINLY HAPPY TO GATHER THAT INFORMATION AND FOLLOW UP WITH YOU ON. BUT BUT ONE THING I NEED TO STRESS IS IF IT'S LIKE I'LL BE HONEST WITH YOU MINISTRATION. WHETHER IT'S THIS OR ANYTHING ELSE- AND I. THEY HAVE THEY HAVEN'T BEEN VERY GOOD ABOUT WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON THINGS AND WE'RE WE'RE PARTNERS IT'S A PARTNERSHIP- LIKE I SAID WE WANT TO PROVE THESE THINGS HELP YOU GUYS GET TO WHERE YOU NEED TO BE BUT WE ALSO NEED YOUR COOPERATION FORSMAN AND LIKELY SAID LAST YEAR WE TALKED ABOUT THIS AND- IT LINKS. AND NOTHING HAS COME FORWARD FROM ANY OF THESE ORGANIZATIONS ALL THREE ORGANIZATIONS ABOUT WHAT'S BEING DONE SO THAT'S THE FRUSTRATION ON OUR PART HERE. YOU KNOW WE WANT TO PLAY NICE BUT IT'S HARD. WHEN WE AREN'T GETTING THAT THE RECIPROCITY BACK. FROM THESE ORGANIZATIONS THESE DEPARTMENT HEADS. SO THAT TO YOU THAT THAT'S IMPORTANT WITH US. SO HAVE A MEANINGFUL ENOUGH MY WORRY WHEN IT COMES UNDER ONE ORGANIZATION YOU KNOW WHAT IS GOING TO CHANGE BECAUSE UP TILL NOW. IT HASN'T WORKED THAT GREAT. SO WHAT'S GONNA CHANGE. MY IS WHAT SURE I THINK ONE OF THE PRIMARY THAT'S GOING TO CHANGE IS THE FACT THAT WE WILL BE ONE COMPREHENSIVE SYSTEM FROM ENFORCEMENT RIGHT NOW DEPENDING ON THE ACTIVITY OFTENTIMES INVOLVES- MANUFACTURING AND DISTRIBUTORS AND SO WE'LL HAVE ONE TEAM WILL BE ABLE TO DO FROM START TO FINISH ALL OF THE ISSUES IN IN ONE ORGANIZATION THEY'LL BE ONE ORGANIZATION AS A PRIMARY CONTACT POINT THERE WON'T BE- TALK TO PUBLIC HEALTH OR TALK TO CDFA BECAUSE THAT INVOLVES THEM SO I THINK THAT'S GOING. TO BE VERY HELPFUL- AS WE WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE BUT ALSO AS WE WORK WITH OUR LICENSEES AND THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THAT WE PARTNER WITH. I'M READING IN THE IN THE IN THE STAFF REPORT PROPOSAL LEDGES AND ALSO ALLEGES. THE DEPARTMENT OF CANNABIS CONTROL WILL HAVE A MORE STREAMLINED COMPLIANCE ENFORCEMENT PROCESS. AND THIS IS A STATEWIDE OPERATION YOU HAVE A LOT OF LICENSES IF YOU LOOK AT THAT THE TRIAD IN THE CANNABIS. WITH WHO THERE IS A LOT TO LOOK AT. AND YOU HAVE SOME INVESTIGATORS ARE BATCH CARRIERS. THAT ARE DOING THINGS THAT THAT ARE SWORN LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS TO TALKING SEVENTY SIX. INVESTIGATORS. FOR A STATE WIDE OPERATION. WHICH NUCLEAR AFFECTED STATE OF FORTY MILLION PEOPLE. IN THE NUMBER OF BUSINESSES DOING CANNABIS. NO MATTER WHAT IT IS THAT IS WOEFULLY INADEQUATE. WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT CAN YOU THINK ABOUT A PRODUCTION THAT THAT THE GROWS- THE MANUFACTURING THE RETAIL HOW CAN SEVENTY SIX OFFICERS. DO ANY TYPE OF SIGNIFICANT INVESTIGATION. PERIOD THEY ARE MEANING IF YOU LOOK AT THE OPERATIONS TALK ABOUT EARLIER IN THOSE INVESTIGATIONS THAT'S JUST BARELY SCRATCHING THE SURFACE TO DEAL WITH IT IT'S JUST A IT'S THAT'S THAT'S THE HELP ME REALIZE HOW THAT IS. AND THEN MIND YOUR TELL YOU RIGHT NOW I SPENT TEN YEARS IN OUR CLOCKS ARRESTEE WHY NARCOTICS TASK FORCE. IT'S BEEN THIRTY YEARS INSURANCE DEPARTMENTS AND ONE TALKING ABOUT SO WHEN I SAY IT'S WOEFULLY INADEQUATE. I'M SPEAKING FROM A POSITION OF EXPERTISE WITH THIS. SO THAT'S A CONCERN OF MINE. BUT HERE YOU ARE REPRESENTING THE AGENCY TELLING ME THAT ADEQUATE. HOW HOW DO YOU RECONCILE THAT PLEASE. SO I THINK THERE'S A COUPLE OF FACETS WHEN IS THAT THE YOU KNOW LICENSED INVESTIGATIONS ARE COMPLIANCE UNITS WILL CANCEL THOSE- THOSE OF THE NON SWORN BUT THEY'RE DOING THOSE INVESTIGATIONS OF REALLY TO LICENSEES AT TIMES THERE'S CROSSOVER WITH OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS SO THERE IS A LARGE GROUP- OF INVESTIGATORS AND INSPECTORS THAT WILL BE FOCUSING ON ON THOSE. THAT INVOLVE LICENSEES FOR THE UNLICENSED WE DO HAVE THE SEVENTY SIX ONE AT THIS POINT IN TIME- AND WE'RE FILLING THOSE POSITIONS WE ARE WORKING WITH THE LOCALS AND OUR OTHER STATE PARTNERS AND I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE WAYS THAT WE MAKE GOOD PROGRESS IS BY COMBINING THOSE RESOURCES AND TO WORK TOGETHER. I THINK ALSO ONE OF THE THINGS WE KEEP IN MIND IS THAT COMBAT IN THE LEGAL MARKET ISN'T SIMPLY JUST TAKING ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS I THINK THERE'S OTHER WAYS THAT TO HELP WITH THAT AND ONE IS TO TRY TO MAKE SURE. THAT THE LEGAL MARKETS ACCESSIBLE TO LICENSEES YOU KNOW A LOT OF LOCAL JURISDICTIONS DON'T ALLOW LEGAL CANNABIS MARKETS- AND MAKING SURE THAT THE PARTICIPATION IN THE LABOR MARKET IS NOT COST PROHIBITIVE. AND ADDITIONALLY MAKING SURE THAT REASONABLY PRICED CANNABIS IS AVAILABLE TO OUR CONSUMERS SO I THINK IF WE COUPLE THOSE ACTIVITIES AND THOSE POINTS OF FOCUS ALONG WITH ENFORCEMENT WE CAN MAKE MORE PROGRESS ON THE ILLEGAL MARKET FRONTS THE BLACK MARKET IS ALIVE AND THRIVING AND IS ACTUALLY DOING VERY WELL. AND EVEN ON INVESTIGATION THOUGH SEVEN SIX INVESTIGATORS THERE BAY STATEWIDE. THEY'RE NOT IN ONE LOCATION CORRECT. THAT IS THE ARE NOT ALL IN ONE. CANNOT RETURN FLYING I MEAN YOU'RE REST OF YOUR FLY BACK OF IN CALIFORNIA. SO THEY'RE STILL HEAVILY RELY UPON LOCAL INVESTIGATORS DO THAT. EFFORT FOR INVESTIGATION SURVEILLANCE MANY DOZENS OF OFFICERS TO DO THAT SO- AND I'M JUST YOU KNOW. I KNOW YOU DON'T YOU'RE NOT. IN UP A SWORN OFFICER SO YOU DON'T KNOW. BUT WHAT I'M TELLING YOU IS- THOSE NUMBERS ARE NOT SIGNIFICANT OR NOT PUTTING A DENT IN IT. AND WE SAY IT'S ADEQUATE ONCE AGAIN THEY'RE STILL VAPING GAS GOING ON SO SILLIMANITE ASSUME THAT YOU'RE OKAY WITH THAT THAT. THERE'S ADEQUATE ENFORCEMENT SILLIER THEY'VE ADDRESSED THE VAPING ISSUE FOR. BLACK MARKET VAPING PRODUCTS AND THEY'RE NO MORE DESK BEHIND. THAT IS THAT WHAT HE'S SAYING. NOW WE'RE SIR. OKAY WITH THE UP OBVIOUS. AND WHERE DOING YOU KNOW IT WHEN THOSE ITEMS COME TO OUR ATTENTION WEEK WE WORK VERY HARD TO IT TO COME ABOUT THOSE AND DEAL WITH THOSE H. I THINK WE HAD- THE VERTICAL BUT LESS SITUATION WITHOUT THE LARGE- LICENSEE WHO. CONDUCTING ILLEGAL IN THEM UNLICENSED ACTIVITY BOTH AS A LICENSEE AS WELL AS- ENGAGING WITH UNLICENSED FOLKS SO I THINK WHEN I SET UP BUT WE THINK THIS IS THE APPROPRIATE STAFFING RIGHT NOW WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO BUILD THOSE RESOURCES- AND THEN ONCE WE DO I THINK WE CAN BETTER ASSESS IF WE NEED ADDITIONAL RESOURCES AS WE'RE FILLING THESE NEW POSITIONS THAT WE RECEIVED LAST FISCAL YEAR. AND AS YOU KNOW IT TAKES A WHILE TO GET GET OFFICERS CAN BACKGROUND PROCESS YEAH AND THEN ALSO SEEING HOW THE CONSOLIDATION IMPACTS THOSE ARE ABILITY IS THERE AND WE THINK THAT WILL GIVE US- SOME GREATER EFFICIENCIES AND THE ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO PARTNER WITH THE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AS WELL AS OUR STATE LAW ENFORCEMENT PARTNERS TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THE WORK AGAINST THE BLACK MARKET. AND WE TALKED ABOUT LAST. HOW RENT THE BLACK. FOR WILL LA. YOU CAN LOOK DOWN FOR MUCH ANY STREET IN FOR BLACK MARKET VIEW BROUGHT. SO DO YOU ARE YOU TELL ME RIGHT NOW THAT THAT HAS CHANGED DRAMATICALLY THAT IT'S GONE DOWN- MUSCLES BUSINESSES STILL. IN OPERATION. I DON'T HAVE THE ANSWERS RIGHT NOW TO ANY SPECIFIC BUSINESSES BUT I KNOW THAT WE'RE CONTINUING TO DO INVESTIGATIONS. AND WE ARE CERTAINLY SENSITIVE TO THE ISSUES WITH BABY LAST YEAR HIM QUITE CLOSE ATTENTION TO THAT WHEN THEY'RE BROUGHT TO OUR ATTENTION AND WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO DO THAT UNDER THE NEW DEPARTMENT. AND TALKING TO LAW ENFORCEMENT GOALS GOALS- VAPING SHOPS. THE LIST OF ONES A BLACK MARKET ONES. ARE STILL OPEN AND ARE STILL THRIVING. BECAUSE THE ENFORCEMENT IS NOT THERE WITH THEM. SO I'M I'M GONNA START MY QUESTIONING MADAM CHAIR AND- INTERNET BACK OVER TO YOU BUT IT THAT THAT'S A BIG ISSUE LIKE I SAID- IF IT WASN'T FOR COVERT RIGHT NOW WE WOULD HEAR A LOT ABOUT PEOPLE DYING. IN THE BLACK MARKET. MARKET VAPING AND IT'S FRUSTRATING. THAT YOU KNOW WE WE'VE BEEN OVER BACKWARDS FOR THE INDUSTRY TO GET HIM UP WE HELP THEM OT. AND NOW IT'S TIME IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE INVOLVED IN THE ILLEGAL MARKET. MAY BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE AND FOR NOT FOR COVERED. WE'D BE TALKING ABOUT THESE DEATHS JUST LIKE. THE FENTANYL OVERDOSES ARE STILL GOING ON IN IN THE- THE HEROIN. THE STUFF IS STILL ALIVE. COBIZ JUST TAKEN THE CONVERSATION OVER. SO I THINK WE'RE DOING FULL SAID OF DISSERVICE. INCLUDING THE LEGAL. FOR THE FOURTH IN THE LEGAL MARKET. BECAUSE THE BLACK MARKET IT IS WAY CHEAP IN THE BLACK MARKET IS ALIVE AND THRIVING. AND IN MY OPINION. THE STATE HASN'T DONE ENOUGH IN NEEDS DOING US IN IN A STARTS HERE WITH THE PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN LEGISLATORS AND ADMINISTRATION. IT CAN'T BE ONE SIDED UP TILL NOW. AND I'VE TALKED TO MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES THEY FELT THAT HAS BEEN ONE SIDED WITH THE ADMINISTRATION. AND WE'VE GOT TO WORK TOGETHER TO FIX THIS. OTHERWISE IT IS GOING TO RUN A CONTINUOUS OF THINKING VENTURE. THANK YOU MISTER COOPER AND I APPRECIATE YOUR EXPERTISE AS A FORMER LAW ENFORCEMENT OFICER TO BE ABLE TO BRING THAT EXPERTISE TO THIS COMMAND TO BE ABLE TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE DOING LEGISLATION. IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE ADMINISTRATION THE REFLECTS WHAT'S NEEDED ON THE GROUND. MISTER LUCKY. YOU'RE JUST REAL QUICK I WOULD LIKE TO JUST FOLLOW UP ON MY COLLEAGUES REMARKS. AS IT AS IT RELATES TO FORTUNATE. MA'AM I WILL TELL YOU THAT IT IS REALLY. CLEAR THAT THE- THE BIGGEST THREAT TO THE LEGAL MARKET RIGHT NOW IS. IS THE THRIVING ILLICIT MARKET AND THE ILLICIT MARKET- IS A THREAT UNDERCOVER WAYS AND WHEN WE HAVE. OF A LAW ENFORCEMENT GROUP THAT IS MORE. FOCUSED ON. GETTING LICENSING COMPLIANCE WE'RE FOCUSING ON THOSE WHO ARE TRYING TO BE. TEAM PLAYERS AND FOLLOW THE RULES. AND THEY'RE THE ONLY ONES GET THE FOCUS AND I THINK THAT THAT'S UNFORTUNATE BECAUSE IT. IT'S SENDING AN UNINTENDED MESSAGE WHICH IS- YOU KNOW WE'RE ONLY INTERESTED IN AND- POLICING YOU FOLKS WHO ARE TRYING TO FOLLOW IN COMPLIANCE AND- I KNOW THAT'S NOT THE INTENTION BUT THAT IS THE CONSEQUENCE AND THAT IS WHAT'S HAPPENING. AND WE NEED TO CHANGE THAT- PARADIGM AND I'M HOPING THAT- YOUR MINISTRATION IN THIS NEW MERGER WILL- RE DIRECT THE FOCUS TOWARDS ILLICIT MARKET BECAUSE- UNTIL WE DO SO- THE LEGAL MARKET WE HAVE. ALL SORTS OF GOOD PLAYERS WHO ARE FALLING OUT EVERY DAY. AND THEY'RE GIVING UP BECAUSE OF THE DIFFICULTY THAT THEY'RE HAVING AND MANAGING AND COMPLYING WITH THESE RULES. WHEN THEIR COMPETITORS HAVE NO RULES AND UNLESS THE ONLY THING THEY WILL RECOGNIZE AS BEING SHUT DOWN WHEN YOU SAY. YOU KNOW THERE'S ONLY ONE YOU HAVE HESITATION OF FOCUSING ON A FORTUNATE BUT- I'M TELLING YOU THAT THERE ARE DIFFERENT WAYS TO CARRY OUT ENFORCEMENT. AND IT DOESN'T MEAN SEND PEOPLE TO PRISON IT MEANS SHUT HIM DOWN. GO AFTER THEIR MONEY THAT'S WHAT WILL SHUT THEM DOWN. AND THAT TAKES A COORDINATED EFFORT IT TAKES A LOT OF WORK BUT IT MUST BE A PRIORITY AT THE TOP. AND I DON'TGET THE VIBE THAT- WE'VE GOT IT AT THE TOP BUT WE SO WE NEED TO WORK ON THAT WE HOPE THAT WE CAN GET YOU TO BE A PARTNER TO. FIGHT AGAINST ILLICIT MARKET. THANK YOU FOR THAT MISTER LACKING- ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS FROM THE MEMBERS. NOW I HAVE A QUESTION R. D. C. A. C. P. AGENCY FOR CDFA IS BUDGETS BEING REDUCED BECAUSE THE- THOSE STAFFING COST OWNERSHIP TO THIS NEW DEPARTMENT OF CANNABIS CONTROL. I CAN'T BELIEVE EVERYTHING FROM FINANCE YES THEY WILL THEIR- EACH OF THOSE DEPARTMENTS AS A WHAT WE CALL NEGATIVE PCP TO REDUCE THOSE RESOURCES. THAT WE CAN NEVER DEBATED APARTMENT. AND ALSO AND WHAT IS THAT NUMBER LOOK LIKE WHAT IS THE REDUCTION NUMBER LOOK LIKE. ONE MOMENT. SO IT'S- THE CNSUMER AFFAIRS IT IS SEVENTY THREE POINT FOUR MILLION FROM THE CANNABIS CONTROL FUND. AT THREE TWENTY TWO POSITIONS AS WELL AS TWENTY FIVE POINT FIVE MILLION FROM THE TAX FUND AND SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND REIMBURSEMENTS. FOR FOOD AND AGRICULTURE IT SIXTY FOUR POINT ONE MILLION FROM THE CANNABIS CONTROL FOUND AND A HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE POSITIONS. IN FORT BUT HELLO IT IS A HUNDRED NINETEEN POSITIONS AND TWENTY NINE MILLION DOLLARS IN THE CANNABIS CONTROL FUND SOME ALSO OCCUR OUT OF THOSE THREE WHAT'S THE TOTAL REDUCTION AND THE BUDGET. BECAUSE OF THE BECAUSE DUE TO STAFFING COST. THERE WILL NOT BE GIFTING WHAT'S THE TOTAL NUMBER. THAT'S ALL AND- PAID FOR AND THE AGENDA AND IT IS A HUNDRED FIFTY POINTS. SEVEN MILLION. AND FIVE HUNDRED NINETY EIGHT POSITIONS. THERE'S A CHART WHERE IT'S LAID OUT FOR YOU YES I'M I'M LOOKING AT IT I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND TO THE PREVIOUS QUESTIONS BEFORE THAT WE'RE ADDING TWENTY THREE ADDITIONAL NEW STAFF AND KEEPING FIVE HUNDRED AND NINETY EIGHT POSITIONS THAT ARE BEING TRANSFERRED. AND SO I'M I'M CURIOUS AS TO WHERE THE SAVINGS TO THE CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS BY CREATING A NEW DEPARTMENT. WE'RE NOT LOOKING AT SAVINGS IN TERMS OF DOLLARS WERE LOOKING AT IT IN TERMS OF MORE STREAMLINED WORK PRODUCT IN MORE EFFICIENT PROCESSES HAVE BEEN CONSERVING WATER- AND I'D ALSO LIKE TO- JUST MENTION FROM THE PREVIOUS COMMENTS FROM MR COOPER AND MR LACKEY. THERE'S ALSO FUNDING THAT GOES TO THE BOARD OF STATE AND COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS- SO THERE IS ADDITIONAL FUNDING AND THAT. AMOUNT- RBC CAPITAL MARKETS. IS SIXTY SIX POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS. OKAY THANK YOU FOR THAT I THINK IT'S EXCITING TO BE AT THE FOREFRONT OF A DEVELOPMENT OF THE NEW DEPARTMENT WHEN WE HAVESUCH AN INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY TO STREAMLINE BUT TO ALSO LOOK AT- WAYS THAT SYSTEMS CAN BE IMPROVED SPECIFICALLY WHAT CONCERNS ME AND WE'VE SEEN THIS IN OTHER DEPARTMENTS AS WELL AS CREATING A DEPARTMENTS CREATING MORE ADDITIONAL STAFF AND JUST ADDING TO A BUREAUCRATIC PROCESS THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY WORK AND ULTIMATELY SPENDING MORE MONEY FOR SOMETHING THAT- ISN'T FUNCTIONING. SO I THINK- BASED ON THE CONVERSATIONS THAT WE'RE HEARING TODAY IT LOOKS LIKE WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE MORE DISCUSSIONS IN TERMS OF HOW THIS DEPARTMENT WILL BE RUN AND THE RESOURCES THAT- BE NEEDED TO INSURE THAT THERE'S PROPER ENFORCEMENT THERE'S COLLABORATION BETWEEN THE STATE. TEXANS TO AND ULTIMATELY THAT WE'RE USING- OUR STATE DOLLARS APPROPRIATELY. IF THERE ARE NO OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. WE CAN MOVE ON TO THE NEXT PANEL THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

I WANT TO JUST UNDERSTAND WHY THIS PARTICULAR BOARD AND- AND NOT OTHERS. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION AND WE REALIZE THE PANDEMIC HAS BEEN HARD ON ALL KINDS OF FOLKS UNLESS THEY HAVE ALL DIFFERENT KINDS OF LICENSEES. BUT WE FELT THE BARBERING AND COSMETOLOGY COMMUNITY WAS PARTICULARLY HARD HIT BECAUSE OF THEIR- CLOTHES. FOR BUT THE CAPACITY TO OPERATE- YOU KNOW MAYBE ONLY OUTDOORS OR FURTHER TO GET THE TIME THEY WERE CLOSED ENTIRELY. ARE THERE ANY OTHER- ANY OTHER OCCUPATIONS YOU'RE LOOKING UP AT THIS POINT OR JUST THIS ONE. EXISTENCE WHEN A CONSUMER AFFAIRS THERE'S ALSO- A COMPANION PROPOSAL FOR CERTAIN LICENSEES OF THE ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE CONTROL DEPARTMENT AND THAT'S PRIMARILY BARS AND RESTAURANTS.

GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS PATRICK PARADE CHIEF OF THE BUREAU OF AUTOMOTIVE REPAIR. ZERO REQUESTED. THREE MILLION DOLLARS DOCUMENTATION OF THE REPAIR ASSISTANCE SCHEDULE OF THE HYPE WILL GET OVER THERE. ACT WE ARE TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY TWO TWENTY TWO. AND ALSO FY. TWENTY TWO TWENTY TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE WHICH WOULD INCREASE THE ANNUAL% APPROPRIATION FOR THE REPAIRS BUSINESS PROGRAM TO MILLION. EIGHTY SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS. PROCREATION WILL SUPPORT RECENT CHANGES TO REGULATIONS THAT ARE DESIGNED TO BENEFIT LOW INCOME CONSUMERS. AND IMPROVE CALIFORNIA'S AIR QUALITY ARE SPECIFICALLY ANNUAL EXPENDITURES FOR THE PAYROLL SMOG CHECK REPAIR SYSTEMS PROGRAM ARE EXPECTED TO BE ON THE CURRENT SPENDING AUTHORITY OF. THE MILLION. SEVEN HUNDRED NINETY SIX THOUSAND. AND THE COMING FISCAL YEAR THAT IS DUE TO THE ANTICIPATED CLIMATE ADOPTION OF EMERGENCY REGULATIONS THAT WERE IMPLEMENTED ON AUGUST THIRTY FIRST LAST YEAR. THESE REGULATIONS PROVIDE UP TO TWELVE HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR CONDITIONS REPAIRS. WITH MORE THAN DOUBLE THE PREVIOUS AMOUNT. AND CLUED OTHER CHANGES TO HELP LOW INCOME CONSUMERS WITH SMOG CHECK REPAIRS IN THEIR VEHICLES. THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING WILL ALLOW THE REPAIR OF APPROXIMATELY SIXTY THREE HUNDRED VEHICLES PER YEAR OVER THREE TIMES. LAST YEAR'S VOLATILE WHILE PROVIDING THE CARE OF THE OPPORTUNITY TO GATHER MORE DATA REGARDING THE SCOPE OF CONSUMER DEMAND FOR THE PROGRAM. UNDER THE NEW REGULATIONS. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO RESPECT RESPOND TO THIS REQUEST. I AM AVAILABLE ALONG WITH THE NEEDS CUNNINGHAM WHO OVERSEES THE CONSUMER ASSISTANCE PROGRAM AT THE PIER ALL ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU MISTER DRAKE. WE HAVE A QUICK QUESTION FOR YOU ACTUALLY TWO MISTER LUCKY GO AHEAD. YEAH I SEE HERE THAT THE- WHAT YOU'RE ASKING FOR IS TWO POINT THREE MILLION HELP ME UNDERSTAND WHY YOU. ARE ONLY ASKING FOR TWO POINT THREE WHEN YOU BELIEVE THAT THAT IT'S LIKELY TO A DEMAND SEVEN MILLION. BECAUSE HERE HERE'S HERE'S MY FRUSTRATION IS I. REPRESENT A DISTRICT THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY. A FIELD WITH MANY HIGH INCOME PEOPLE. AND SAW THEIR INADVERTENTLY IMPACTED WORSE THAN MOST PEOPLE BECAUSE- AS INDICATED IN YOUR OWN NOTES MANY LOW INCOME VEHICLE OWNERS ARE UNABLE TO AFFORD REPAIRS THE FALL IN THIS- INSPECTION DEMAND KNOWS RESULT THEY CONTINUE DRIVING THEIR POLLUTING VEHICLE WITH EITHER EXPIRED REGISTRATION TAGS. OR FRAUDULENT CERTIFICATES THAT IS A BAD SCENARIO THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO- HELP BRING REMEDY TOWARD. WHAT WE UNDERSTAND A GOOD POINT I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YEAH THAT THE NUMBERS ARE TWO POINT THREE MILLION OF THE CURRENTLY- ARE BUDGETED FOR AND WE'RE ASKING FOR AN INCREASE OF ABOUT TWO POINT SEVEN MILLION. RAINING OUR ANNUAL MOUNT FOR THE PROGRAM TO A LITTLE OVER FIVE MILLION I GUESS WE'LL JUST GATHER ALLOW US MORE TIME TO GATHER INFORMATION BUT LET RELATIVE TO- CONSUMER PARTICIPATION AND DEMAND FOR THE PROGRAM WE'VE ALREADY SEEN- FIFTY ADOPTION OF EMERGENCY REGULATIONS LAST YEAR- OKAY. I'M REALLY HEALTHY RESPONSE. THE NEW ARE MOUNTED AND FAT IN REGULATE ASIAN UP TO TWELVE HUNDRED DOLLARS A TIME AS I POINTED OUT SO I THINK IT GIVES US A CHANCE THAT IT. AND FIND OUT WHAT OUR PARTICIPATION RATE ALL RIGHT IT'S GOING TO BE UNDER THE NEW REGULATIONS OKAY DOPP STUDY ON BEFORE. THE END OF THE YEAR. I WILL CONCERNS OVER THIS DEFICIT BECAUSE IT DOES. AS OUR PATROL MEMBER I CAN TELL YOU IN A PORSCHE CAPACITY THIS IS A BIG PROBLEM. AND IT'S VERY VERY REAL IN MY DISTRICT I DON'T KNOW ABOUT- MANY OTHER DISTRICTS BUT THERE'S A VERY REAL PROBLEM. AND I THINK WE SHOULD BE BETTER STEWARDS AND LISELOTTE IN THE AT THE APPROPRIATE. FUNDING SO THAT IT CAN BE FIXED. YES HOW TO PART FINANCE- HE- U. S. HEARING YES PLEASE GO AHEAD- JUST OF THE IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THE ACTUAL IMPLEMENTATION COST ME BE HIGHER BUT THERE'S NO HARD DATA TO SUPPORT THAT THIS TIME IT'S JUST AN ESTIMATE SO WE THINK THIS PROPOSAL- IT'S IMPORTANT PURCHASE A LOT OF THE BUREAU TO COLLECT DATA FROM THIS YEAR AND NEXT YEAR TO SUPPORT THE APPROPRIATE. LEVEL AND- IF THE- YOU'RE A FINDS THAT- YOU KNOW THE DEMAND IS- VERY HIGHLY AND MORE IN ADDITIONAL COSTS ARE NEEDED- NOTHING FOR. OUR MAKING. OTHER PLASTICS- MISTER COOPER. IT IS A QUESTION SO IT'S OBVIOUSLY GOING TO GO FROM BASICALLY TWENTY ONE HUNDRED VEHICLES TO OVER NINE THOUSAND I HEARD. A BIT OF AN EXPLANATION OF LIFE THAT'S THAT'S STILL PRETTY DRAMATIC. MATCHES COULD BECAUSE THE AGE OF THE VEHICLES ARE ARE WHY. CORRECT I WOULD SAY THAT THE NINE THOUSAND WAS AN INITIAL ESTIMATE EARLY IN THE EARLY DAYS OF THE PANDEMIC. I'M LAST SPRING AND PRIOR TO ADOPTION OF THE EMERGENCY REGULATIONS LAST AUGUST. I DATA GATHERED SINCE THE ADOPTION OF THE REGULATIONS AND SUPPORT A MORE MODEST PROJECTION OF ABOUT SIX THOUSAND PEOPLE. THAT WAS DRIVING UP THE DEMAND FOR REPAIR ASSISTANCE. HELLO. VEHICLES NEEDING FAILING THE SMOG CHECK PROGRAM- AND WHEN THEY'RE SMOG CHECK INSPECTION AND NEEDING REPAIRS AND HAVING A HIGHER DOLLAR AMOUNT THAT WE NOW- WHAT AIMED TOWARDS- AIR. PREVIOUSLY OF THE SENATE CAPITAL CAPITAL FIVE DOLLARS RIGHT THAT MEANS THAT THE PROGRAM INCEPTION BACK IN THE EARLY TWO THOUSANDS. HAVE BEEN MODIFIED. I TIME. AFTER REPAIRS THE VEHICLE THAT WE- YOUR ATTENTION HADN'T MODIFY TWENTY YEARS AND YET WE'RE PAYING TO BUY ELECTRIC. IN AND GIVING REBATES FOR THAT WHICH IS WHICH IS TOTALLY ARE IRONIC SO I COMMEND YOU GUYS ON UPPING THE REPAIRS A TWELVE HUNDRED DOLLARS BUT STILL WHAT PERCENT OF VEHICLES DO WE SEE THAT ARE NOT REPAIRABLE THAT HAVE TO BE PULLED OFF THE ROAD. I DON'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION IN FRONT OF ME OF CERTAINLY CAN PROVIDE THE NUMBER OF VEHICLES MAKE YEAH- HELLO SMOG INSPECTION. THE PUBLIC THIS. INCREASE AMOUNT WILL ALLOW MORE CONSUMERS TO BE ABLE TO COMPLY WITH THE VEHICLE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENT NOT OUT. I'M REGISTERED A FUNDING ROUND THANK YOU SO AS AS I READ THE REPORT A LOT OF FOLKS JUST CONTINUE TO DRIVE THOSE VEHICLES AROUND. AND DON'T REGISTER THEM CORRECT. I THAT IS OPTION IS A POP IF NOT YEAH YEAH. WE'RE TRYING. WHAT HOPE THAT WITH THE DAHLE AMOUNT THAT LIKELY TO HAPPEN OKAY. I DON'T I'M NOT SURE. IF THERE'S A- HEAD INFORMATION RESPECT TO LICENSES I APPRECIATE THAT BUT YOU CAN'T HAVE IT BOTH WAYS BECAUSE IN THE REPORT IS THAT. THE PEOPLE CAN STILL CONTINUE TO DRIVE THEIR CARS AROUND. SO THAT'S THE SUDDEN OBVIOUSLY THEY ARE WE KNOW THEY ARE I MEAN IT'S NOT LIKE YOU ABOUT IT SO CONTINUE TO DRIVE THAT AND POLLUTE I GUESS THE BIG ISSUE HERE IS THE MEDIAN AGE OF THE VEHICLE PER DIEM V. IN CALIFORNIA IS FOURTEEN YEARS OLD SO SAY SOMEONE'S CAR CAN'T BE REPAIRED DO YOU GIVE THEM MONEY TOWARDS A NEW CAR- PURCHASING A NEW. A NEW CAR. THERE ARE PROGRAMS IN TWO ALSO RETIRED VEHICLES THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO REPAIR THE VEHICLE AND THAT'S AN OPTION YEAH RIGHT BUT IN. HER AND YES THERE ARE PROGRAMS RUN. YOU INSTEAD OF A- ADVERTISE VEHICLE BY PUTTING THE VEHICLE OWNER IN A NEWER CLEANER VEHICLE BUT WAS THERE A PROBLEM HERE. RUNNING CONCERT WITH EACH RESOURCES BUT THE ISSUE IS THAT WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE THIS IS BACKWARDS THAT IS. ADULTS FORTY DOUBLES LIKE SAID FORTY THE AVERAGE JUST MANAGES FOURTEEN YEARS OLDER. MOST FOLKS DON'T HAVE A CAR PAYMENT. THEY CAN OF A CAR. SO IF YOU READ THERE VIA. IF THE FUNDS ARE OUT THERE TO GIVE THEM MONEY. THEY'RE NOT GONNA BUY A NEW VEHICLE BECAUSE THEY CAN'T AFFORD A CAR PAYMENT. IN THIS YEAR CLOVIS ABOUT SURVIVABILITY IT'S ABOUT PAYING YOUR MORTGAGE OR RENT. PUTTING FOOD ON YOUR TABLE IN YOUR UTILITY BILLS IN CALIFORNIA OUR UTILITY BILLS OR 45% HIGHER THAN THE REST OF THE COUNTRY AND WE'RE ABOUT TO GO ALL ELECTRIC TO THE RICH GROWING UP HIGHER GAS IS A DOLLAR MORE GALLON IN CALIFORNIA ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE COUNTRY SO WHAT WHEN I SAY THAT IT'S- YOU KNOW AND THEN WE HAVE THE EXECUTIVE ORDER. WHERE THERE'S NO SALES OF GASOLINE VEHICLES STARTING IN TWENTY THIRTY FIVE IN CALIFORNIA SO FOR THESE WHATEVER THIS PERSON IS THAT DRUG IS A VEHICLES THAT ARE POOR ARE IMMIGRANTS ARE SINGLE MOTHERS WITH CHILDREN. THEY CAN'T AFFORD A NEWER VEHICLE THEY CAN'T AFFORD A CAR PAYMENT THEY CAN'T AFFORD THE V. FLOWS WERE CALIFORNIA IS BASS AFTERWARDS WHEN THEY DO THIS AND THEY PAY YOU TO BUY ANY V. BUT YET YOUR OLD CAR THAT'S A CLUNKER. YOU KNOW IT'S JUST IT'S MIND NUMBING STILL YOU GUYS DID A GOOD JOB THANK YOU BUT WE'VE GOT IT WE'RE GONNA JUSTICE SOMEHOW AND GET PUT IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION HEALTH ADMINISTRATION. WILL WILL DO THAT. THANK MANAGER. THANK YOU MISTER COOPER MCCARTY TRANSACTION COMMITTEE. THANK YOU- MYSTERY I THINK WHAT YOU'RE HEARING IS JUST- A LITTLE BIT OF FOR OF FRUSTRATION IN TERMS OF. IDEALS AND GOALS THAT THE STATE HAS VERSUS THE REALITY OF FOLKS ON THE GROUND AND WHAT WE WANTED SHE VERSUS WHAT IS- AN OPPORTUNITY AT THE MOMENT AND SO I THINK THIS. THIS IS A AN INTERESTING CONVERSATION I MAY REQUIRE US TO LOOK AT IT A LITTLE BIT A LITTLE BIT MORE IN TERMS OF WHAT CAN WHAT CAN WE POTENTIALLY DO TO BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE. WHAT THE STATE CALLS ARE SO THANK YOU FOR THAT- LET'S HEAR FROM THE ADDITIONAL PANEL- SMITH SACRAMENTO YOU WANT TO GO AHEAD. I THINK YOU KNOW GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE.

HAVING TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. I JUST HAVE ONE FOR YOU MISSY FOR MEN- CAN YOU EXPLAIN- WHY THERE HAS BEEN SUCH A HUGE INCREASE IN CONSUMER CONF- COMPLAINTS. ABOUT 72% INCREASE. YEAH AND SO WHEN WE LOOK AT THE DATA IT LOOKS LIKE IT CORRELATES EXACTLY WHEN FOR WHEN WE WENT LIVE AND BRINGS IN JANUARY OF TWENTY SIXTEEN. THAT'S WHEN YOU START SEEING THAT THAT DRAMATIC INCREASE AND WE BELIEVE IT'S BECAUSE IT'S MUCH MORE IT'S MUCH EASIER FOR CONSUMERS TO FILE COMPLAINTS ONLINE. AND ALSO FROM LICENSEES AND IT'S MUCH MORE STREAMLINED THEY DON'T HAVE TO PRINT OUT A COMPLETE FORM FILL IT OUT AND MAIL IT IN TO US IT'S MUCH MORE CONVENIENT. WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT IS TIED TO THE AVAILABILITY AND ACCESSIBILITY. OF BEING ABLE TO FILE A COMPLAINT THAT MY- CAN YOU SHARE JUST ME BEING A COUPLE OF DETAILS IF YOU CAN IN TERMS OF WHAT THE COMPLAINTS HAVE BEEN ABOUT. SURE IT WAS SO WHEN WE LOOK AT THEM IN THIS IS IT IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S STILL CONSISTENT WITH THE NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS THAT WE'RE GETTING IT'S AT ABOUT 75% OF THEM. ALLEGING THINGS SUCH AS UNPROFESSIONAL CONDUCT INCOMPETENCE AND NEGLIGENCE AND SO IT'S STILL. A PRETTY BIG AMOUNT OF CASES THAT REQUIRE A LOT MORE THE INVESTIGATION SUCH MATTER EXPERTS REVIEWING MEDICAL RECORDS. I'M AND THINGS LIKE THAT SO IT IS A HUGE INCREASE BUT THEY'RE ALSO. ALLEGES CONCERNS THAT TKE QUITE A BIT OF TIME TO INVESTIGATE. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT CALIFORNIA HAPPENS TO BE ONE OF THE STATE'S THAT SPENDS THE MOST MONEY WHEN IT COMES TO- ISSUES RELATING TO PETS. SO IT'S VERY INTERESTING TO SEE THE TYPE OF OR TO HEAR THE TYPE OF COMPLAINTS. THAT YOU HAVE BEEN RECEIVING AND TERM AND I AM I'M A DOG OWNER I YOU KNOW I LUIS IS. VERY FAMOUS AROUND HERE AND WITH FRIENDS. BUT IT IT'S IT I THINK ABOUT- I THINK ABOUT FOLKS THAT TRY THEIR BEST TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR PETS AND- MAY NOT BE RECEIVING THE QUALITY OF CARE WITH THEIR VETERINARIANS AND MANY OF WHOM ALSO DO A LOT OF PRO BONO WORK AND A LOT OF WORK IN LOW INCOME. COMMUNITIES TO TRY TO STAY IN NEUTER- THEIR PETS AND SO I APPRECIATE THE FEEDBACK AND HOPEFULLY WERE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT WAYS THAT.

THANK YOU MR CHIU- AND I APPRECIATE YOUR QUESTIONS ACTUALLY WERE VERY IN LINE WITH WHAT I WAS GOING TO ASK AS WELL SO I APPRECIATE YOU- ASKING THOSE- LET'S GO TO THE BEFORE WE MOVE ON TO THE NEXT- THE NEXT PANEL ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS FROM- THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. SORT OF BORED WITH THE L. A. O. NO ADDITIONAL COMMENTS AT THIS TIME. GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU TO THE PANEL WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO- ISSUE NUMBER EIGHT. A RELATED TO CALIFORNIA ARTS COUNCIL OUR PANEL OF FOR THIS ISSUE AREA WILL BE AND BROWN I'M SORRY AND BILL CRAWFORD WITH CALIFORNIA ARTS COUNCIL. ADDRESS ON A BURKE WITH ELLY ELLS OFFICE AND AMY JARVIS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. HELLO THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS- I'M INBOUND CRAWFORD I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF CALIFORNIA ARTS COUNCIL. THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY BUDGET PROPOSES THE CREATION OF THE CALIFORNIA CREATIVE CORE HI THE PROGRAM. THIS PROGRAM IS TO BE A STATEWIDE PUBLIC AWARENESS CAMPAIGNS USING VARIOUS MESSAGE METHODS TO FUEL POSITIVITY REGAIN PUBLIC TRUST AND INSPIRE SAFE AND HEALTHY BEHAVIOR IN ORDER TO STOP THE SPREAD OF COVERT NINETEEN. WITHIN OUR HARDEST HIT COMMUNITIES. MANAGED BY THE CALIFORNIA ARTS COUNCIL THIS PILOT WILL HAVE CALIFORNIA ARTISTS USING DIFFERENT MEDIUMS TO PROMOTE PUBLIC HEALTH AWARENESS. IN THE HOPES TO PREVENT THE SPREAD OF THE VIRUS. SURMODICS THE PROCESS BY WHICH THE COUNCIL WILL ALLOCATE FUNDS. THE COUNCIL FIRST USER DECISION SUPPORT TOOL FOR LOCAL ASSISTANCE GRANT FUNDS TO DETERMINE HOW THE PROGRAM WILL BE ADMINISTERED I THERE IS A DIRECT PROGRAM OF THE C. A. C. RESERVE PROGRAM COORDINATED THROUGH A RE GRANTING PROCESS. BASED ON THAT DECISION ONE OF THE FOLLOWING METHODOLOGIES WILL BE HERE. IF COUNCIL DETERMINES THE AGENCY SHOULD ADMINISTER THE PROGRAM ITSELF THE C. A. C. WERE USED YOUR JUDICATA AND SCORED PROCESS THAT WE HAVE ESTABLISHED FOR ALL OF OUR GRANTS. SPECIFIC REVIEW CRITERIA WILL BE DEVELOPED FOR THE PROGRAM AND ITS HANDLE OF ART EXPERTS WILL BE ASSEMBLED AS FIELD REPRESENTATIVES TO REVIEW AND SCORE EACH APPLICATION BASED ON THE CRITERIA. THE CDC USES A SIX POINT RANKING SCALE AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE PANEL PROCESS EACH RANKED APPLICANT WILL BE PROVIDED. TO THE COUNCIL FOR FINAL ALLOCATION OF FUNDS FOR INDIVIDUAL GRANT O'ROURKE. IF THE COUNCIL DETERMINES THAT THE PROGRAM SHOULD BE ADMINISTERED THROUGH LOCAL REGIONAL RE GRANTING PROCESS THE ADMINISTRATION ORGANIZATIONAL RECEIVED FUNDS AS AN ARGUMENT TO FIX CURRENT C. A. C. ARMS. THOSE ORGANIZATIONS WILL DEVELOP. A RE GRANTING PROCESSING. USING A TAILORED VERSION OF THE C. A. SEIZE DECISION SUPPORT TOOL THAT'LL BE MONITORED BY THE CAAC TO ENSURE EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION OF THE FUNDS TO THE ARTISTS. THE COUNCIL WILL ALSO BE LOOKING AT BEST PRACTICES SUCH AS THOSE DEVELOPED BY THE UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA. AND INCORPORATING THESE PRACTICES INTO THE GRANT PROGRAM. ARTS AND PUBLIC HEALTH RESEARCH AND BEST PRACTICES WILL BE HIGHLIGHTED IN THE PROGRAM PLAN SPECIFIC RESEARCH WILL BE CITED AND RELEVANT FRAMEWORK WORKS WILL BE DEVELOPED. FOR EXAMPLE COLLABORATIVE STRATEGIES TO REACH TRUSTED COMMUNITY ARTISTS WILL BE PRIORITIZED INVITE PART COMMUNITIES. ADDRESSING REALITIES SUCH AS MEDICAL MISTRUST STRUCTURAL INEQUITIES AND GENERATIONAL TRAUMA. COLLABORATIONS WITH TRUSTED HEALTH PROFESSIONALS AND CLINICS WILL BE EMPLOYED TO GUIDE THE STRATEGIES EMPLOYED BY PARTICIPATING ARTISTS. EVEN WITH THE DEVASTATING IMPACTS OF KROGER NINETEEN CALIFORNIA ARTS ECOSYSTEM IS AMONG THE MOST POWERFUL AND MOST REALLY RICH IN THE WORLD AND SHOULD BE CONSIDERED INVESTED IN AND LEVERAGE. I'M HERE TODAY WITH MY DIRECTOR OF LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS CHRISTIAN MARGOLIS AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE MAY HAVE. THANK YOU FOR THAT- CAN WE HEAR FROM THE ELLY ELLS OFFICE AS WELL AS THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. TRUE SAID ABOARD LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. IN LOOKING AT THIS PROPOSAL. OUR OFFICE BELIEVES THAT THE USE OF ART TO PROMOTE PUBLIC HEALTH MESSAGES. MISSING PRACTICE THAT IS WORTH EXAMINING HOWEVER WITH RESPECT TO SOME OF THE DETAILS OF PROPOSAL WE FEEL THAT THERE ARE SOME KEY UNANSWERED QUESTIONS FOR EXAMPLE AT THIS POINT AS YOU HEARD IT'S A BIT UNCLEAR PRECISELY HOW THE GRANT WOULD BE ADMINISTERED WHETHER IT WOULD BE C. A. C. ADMINISTERING AT A STATEWIDE LEVEL MORE IF THEY PARTNER WITH LOCAL OR REGIONAL PARTNERS TO DIRECT FUNDS DIRECTLY TO ARTISTS. OR COMBINATION OF THE TWO- THERE'S PROS AND CONS OF EACH APPROACH FOR EXAMPLE WHO IS ADMINISTERED AT A STATEWIDE LEVEL- IT'S MORE LIKELY THAT THE PROGRAM WOULD BE- UNIFORM AND ITS- APPLICATION ACROSS THE STATE. WHERE IS IF IT WAS- ADMINISTERED CLOSER TODAY COMMUNITIES THAT'S TARGETED IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THE LOCAL PARTNERS WOULD HAVE MORE INSIGHT INTO THE COMMUNITIES THAT THE ARTIST BEING TARGETED AT. PROBLEM THERE'S ALSO A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT PRECISELY HOW THE FORMS WOULD BE OUT ALLOCATED SO- CDC INDICATES THAT WE'RE GOING TO TARGET COMMUNITIES MOST IMPACTED BY CODE NINETEEN INCLUDING HISTORICALLY MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES. BUT THERE'S A FEW THINGS WE DON'T KNOW SUCH AS WHAT OTHER CRITERIA WILL BE CONSIDERED OR HOW THESE CRITERIA. WILL BE WEIGHED AGAINST ONE ANOTHER. WELL THERE'S ALSO ABOUT HOW MANY WILL BE REACHED. THE OUR UNDERSTAND THAT OUR COUNCIL HOPING WORK WITH FIVE RD. AND OKAY EIGHT. AT POINT IT'S WILL UNCLEAR AS TO HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL BE EXPOSED TO THE ARTWORK THAT WOULD BE. SUPPORTED THIS MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO BE ABLE TO COMPARE THE STRATEGY TO OTHER STRATEGIES THAT MIGHT HAVE MIGHT CONSIDER SUCH AS ADVERTISING. IT'S ALSO A BIT UNCLEAR HOW THE MATCHING REQUIREMENT WOULD WORK. BOB IT'S UNCLEAR SO BASICALLY WHO WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR IDENTIFYING THE MATCHING FUNDS AND IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO GET CLARITY ON THIS BECAUSE THE MATCHING REQUIREMENT COULD UNNECESSARILY. LIMIT THE TYPE AND NUMBER OF ARTISTS WHO ARE ABLE TO APPLY FOR THE GRANTS- AT THIS POINT WE WOULD RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE WITHHOLD ACTION ON THE PROPOSAL UNTIL WE CAN GET. MORE INFORMATION TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS TO THE EXTENT THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS ABLE TO GET INFORMATION THAT SUGGESTS THAT THE PROGRAM WOULD BE EFFECTIVE HOWEVER. WE WOULD RECOMMEND APPROVING IT. HOWEVER OBVIOUSLY IF THE BUTTON FOR IS NOT. OR THERE'S QUESTION ABOUT THE- OF THE PROGRAM ONCE THE INFORMATION IS PROVIDED WE RECOMMEND ABOUT WHAT. THE LEGISLATURE LOOK FOR OTHER ALTERNATIVES. WE'RE HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. THANK YOU FOR THAT I'M SURE WE DO ACTUALLY HAVE SOME QUESTIONS- MISTER NAZARIAN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- MY APPRECIATE THE ANALYSIS THAT WAS OFFERED RIGHT NOW BECAUSE I pSUMMARY MY DISTRICT IS EXTREMELY DEPENDENT ON THE ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT- I ALSO HAVE THE BENEFIT OF REPRESENTING THE HOLLYWOOD BOWL. AND WITH THE SEASON SHUT DOWN AND THE UNCERTAINTY OF WHEN THE SEASON IS GOING TO BE COMING UP BETWEEN THAT AND VENUE AND THE FORD VENUE AS WELL. ALSO THE WALT DISNEY HALL- NOT JUST THE IMMEDIATE JOBS OF THE PERFORMERS AND THE ADMINISTRATION BEHIND IT BUT THEN ALL THE OTHER SUPPORT SYSTEMS ALL OF THE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS ALL THE VENDORS ALL THE EVERYBODY ELSE IS LARGE SCALE OF INDIVIDUALS HAVE BEEN IMPACTED BY THIS. AND SO I'M I'M JUST WONDERING- THE. HOW THE COUNCIL IS MOVING FORWARD N. OFFERING RELIEF OR EVEN IF WE SHOULD BE ASKING FOR SIGNIFICANT LARGER AMOUNT OF MONEY. ONE TWO- A PROPOSAL LIKE THIS THAT WAS GONNA BE HELPFUL TO THE ARTS INDUSTRY AND COMMUNITY SHOULD HAVE ALREADY BEEN IN PLACE AND WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE. SO THAT WE COULD HAVE ROLLED IT OUT ALREADY. SO I I'M KIND OF TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE HOLD UP IS. AND ALSO. WHY NOT BE ASKING FOR MORE MONEY WHEN WE KNOW THAT THE NEED IS DIRE RIGHT NOW. WHAT FIRST OF ALL BEFORE I TURN THIS OVER TO MY NOW TO KRISTIN HOW MY DIRECTOR OF LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS. ACT I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR CREATING THE DARKNESS OF THE SITUATION. THANK YOU- CHRISTIAN. ALL YOU MAY STILL WHO MAY BE ON MUTE. THANKS VERY. OKAY I AM HELLO THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- THANK YOU SO MUCH ASSEMBLY AND THEN UNDER THE RAN FOR YOUR COMMENTS- AS USUAL WE GREATLY APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT I'M PRETTY ARTS COMMUNITY AS WELL AS THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE SUPPORT- AND I THINK OU MAKE A VERY IMPORTANT POINTS- I DO WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU THAT- THE CALIFORNIA- ARTS COUNCIL HAS RECENTLY ADOPTED A NEW STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK. AND THAT STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK WAS DEVELOPED TO GUIDE- THE COUNCIL'S WORK FOR THE NEXT SEVEN YEARS. AND THIS COMPASSES SEVERAL ASPECTS INCLUDING AND INPATIENT ENGINE VALUE STATEMENTS BRISTOL EQUITY STATEMENT A DECISION SUPPORT TOOL WHICH AND MENTIONED THE AND A SET OF ASPIRATIONS FOR POTENTIAL FUTURE ACTIONS OF THE COUNCIL. AND THIS DECISION SUPPORT TOOL IS REALLY WHAT'S GONNA GUIDANCE- FORWARD- WITH THIS PROGRAM AND ALL THE ATARI THANK. YOU FOR A MINUTE I HAVE. THE YOU KNOW- I APPRECIATE YOU OUTLINING SOME OF THE STEPS YOU'VE TAKEN- BUT I GUESS WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY IS THIS ISN'T THE TIME NECESSARILY FOR NEW MISSION VISION GUIDELINES. THIS IS THIS IS IMPLEMENTATION THIS IS GO TIME IT'S BEEN GO TIME FOR SOME TIME NOW- AND I GUESS I WASN'T VERY CLEAR. EARLIER IN MY COMMENTS BUT WHAT I'M ALSO SAYING IS. YOU SHOULD HAVE ALREADY BEEN AND MY OFFICE AS WELL AS MY COLLEAGUES OFFICES AT THIS POINT WHETHER VIRTUALLY WELL VIRTUALLY AT THIS POINT. AND WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN HAVING CONVERSATIONS ABOUT HOW WE- CAN WORK HAND IN HAND IN SUPPORTING THE ARTS. THIS IS THE AREA THAT IMPACTS- ALL OF OUR DISTRICTS SIGNIFICANTLY ESPECIALLY THOSE OF OURS IN THE GREATER LA AREA. AND SO I YOU KNOW I I'M I GUESS I'M JUST SHARING MY FRUSTRATION ALSO THAT AS THE VOICE OF THE ARTS IN THE STATE- WHOSE FUNDING WAS DRIED UP UP UNTIL ABOUT EIGHT YEARS AGO AND STARTED TRICKLING IN AND INCREASING A LITTLE BIT OVER TIME. I WOULD HAVE EXPECTED YOU TO STEP UP AT THIS POINT ALSO TO FIND. WAYS THAT YOU CAN WORK WITH US AND FINDING- GREATER RELIEF- FOR THIS INDUSTRY- THIS IS WHEN THIS INDUSTRY NEEDS THE MOST SUPPORT ESPECIALLY GIVEN ITS INDEPENDENT- NATURE. GIVEN THE INDEPENDENT STRUCTURE OF THE BUSINESS AS WELL NOT TALKING ABOUT THE STUDIOS HERE I'M TALKING ABOUT THE ACTUAL PERFORMERS AND ARTISTS AND THE- FOLKS WHOSE LIVELIHOOD IS BASED AROUND THE PERFORMERS AND THE ARTIST ALSO DOING THEIR WORK. SO IT'S A VERY I DON'T NEED TO TELL YOU THIS BUT VERY INTRICATE WEB. ARTS COUNCIL- SO THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO HEAR AND ALSO WOULD LIKE TO HEAR WHY SOME OF MYSELF AND SO MY COLLEAGUES HAVEN'T HEARD FROM YOU OR ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL ALREADY BECAUSE WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN ON THE GROUND WORKING ON THIS AND FOR IT NOT TO JUST COME UP DURING. OUR BUDGET MEETING. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU MISTER NAZARIAN. AMY JARVIS WITH THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE IF I COULD PLEASE. PLEASE GO AHEAD. OUR GREAT THANK YOU SO MUCH I HAVE A COUPLE OF THINGS I WANTED TO AND REMIND THE COMMITTEE THAT THIS PROPOSAL IS ONE OF OUR EARLY ACTION PROPOSALS IN RECOGNITION THAT IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO GET THESE FUNDS OUT THE DOOR AS SOON AS POSSIBLE IT IS A REQUEST FOR FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS OF WHICH FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IS REQUESTED AND FOR HERE AND TEN MILLION DOLLARS IN THE BUDGET- IN RESPONSE TO A LEO'S COMMENTS I THINK I'M RECOGNIZE SOME OF THE CONCERNS AND THEY HAVE BEEN WORKING DILIGENTLY. ARTS COUNCIL TO GET ANSWERS TO SOME OF THE QUESTIONS ARTS COUNCIL AS YOU ALL KNOW I THINK HAS A STRONG HISTORY IN THE GRANT MAKING PROCESS AND IT'S AT A STRONG HISTORY OF INTEGRITY AND EFFECTIVENESS AND INTEND TO EMBODY ALL OF THOSE THINGS THE PARK ARTS COMMUNITY AND ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT EACH COMMUNITY IS GOING TO HAVE A DIFFERENT TRUSTED MESSENGER IN THE ARTS COMMUNITY- AND SO I THINK THE ARTS COUNCIL ABSOLUTELY ONE HUNDRED PERCENT. READY TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN QUICKLY AND AS EFFECTIVELY AS POSSIBLE LIKE THEY ALWAYS HAVE AND I JUST WANTED TO- ADD THOSE CONSCIOUS AGAIN THE EARLY ACTION ASPECT OF IT DOES DEMONSTRATE THE ADMINISTRATION'S COMMITMENT TO GETTING THESE FUNDS OUT THE DOOR AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE TO SUPPORT. THE ARTS COMMUNITY AS BEST IT CAN. YOU HAVE FALLEN SHORT SO THEN WHEN CAN WE SEE THE- EXACT PROPOSAL. IF AT THIS POINT IN TIME WE'RE HAVING SINCE WE DO HAVE A COUNCIL THAT SETS POLICY WE'RE HAVING- I HAVE A MEETING OF OUR COUNCIL MEMBERS AND WE'RE HAVING THAT AND ABOUT. THREE WEEKS AND WILL BE PUTTING. THERE WAS THE TOGETHER AND GETTING ALL THE DETAILS TOGETHER- I ALSO MIGHT JUST ADD THAT- ADVANCE SAID WE HAD THIS COUNCIL MEETING AND- WHAT I WAS STATING BEFORE IS REALLY KIND OF THE PROCESS THAT THE COUNCIL WILL GO THROUGH SO AND HAD MENTIONED HIS DECISION SUPPORT TOOL AND THAT IS PART OF OUR STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK- THE WHOLE IDEA BEIND THAT DECISION. SUPPORT TOOL IS TO GET MONEY OUT THE DOOR TO THOSE WHO MAY BE DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED BY ACTIONS AND ARE SIGNIFICANT HAVE SOME KIND OF STAKE IN THE RESULTS AND SO- THIS IS HOW WE WILL BE ABLE TO SERVE THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE MOST IN NEED THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA JUST LIKE WE HAVE IN THE PAST WITH ALL OF OUR OTHER PROGRAMS- IN ALL OF YOUR DISTRICTS. FACT AND PROGRAMS LIKE CULTURAL PATHWAYS- AND LOCAL IMPACT OUR PROGRAMS THAT REALLY. ARE GREAT EXAMPLES OF HOW WE'VE ALREADY DONE THIS WORK AND WE'RE READY TO DO THIS WORK- BUT THERE IS A PROCESS AND OUR COUNCIL DOES HAVE TO BE PART OF THAT PROCESS OKAY THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I'LL BE LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING THE PROPOAL AS I'M SURE. MOST OF MY COLLEAGUES WILL BE THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS. I THINK WHAT WHAT YOU'RE HEARING IS ANY AND WHAT YOU'RE CURRENTLY CAUGHT IN- MISS ABOUT CRAWFORD IS. LACK OF DETAILS WHILE WE ARE INCREDIBLY SHORT ON TIME IF THIS IS GOING TO BE MOVING FORWARD AS A- IMMEDIATE ACTION. SO WITHOUT THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE AID DRAFT PLAN OR A PLAN ON HOW THE FUNDING WILL BE DISBURSED OR HOW GRANTEES WILL BE SELECTED. IT IS A CHALLENGING. ISSUE IN TERMS OF EQUITY AND MAKING SURE THAT- FUNDING IN THE BUDGET GOES TO- IS DEBATED IN A IN AN EQUITABLE WAY ACROSS FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES- I BELIEVE THAT ARTS AND I AS WELL AS MY COLLEAGUES BELIEVE THAT ARTS CAN PLAY AND PLAY A ROLE. IN IN A VERY IMPORTANT ROLE ESPECIALLY DURING AT THIS PANDEMIC THAT WE ARE LIVING THROUGH BUT- CAN YOU IS THERE ANY WAY. THAT YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE A PLAN SOONER THAN THE THREE WEEKS THAT YOU ARE ANTICIPATING BEFORE YOU MEET WITH YOUR COUNSEL. THREE WEEKS UNFORTUNATELY IS TOO FAR GONE. WHAT STATE WE CAN OF COURSE SUGGEST A PLAN WE SUGGESTED YOUR TOTAL MEMBERS IT IS. WE CAN'T MOVE FORWARD WITH THE PLAN AND HAVE IT SET IN STONE WITHOUT COUNSEL INVOLVED. SEE THAT'S THAT'S THE AND THAT'S THE UNFORTUNATE PART OF WHAT YOU HAVE IS YOU HAVE SUPPORT. BUT IT WOULD BE IT WOULD BE IT WOULD PUT. THE LEGISLATURE IN A VERY STRANGE POSITION TO APPROVE FUNDING FOR A PLAN THAT HAS DOESN'T YET EXIST. YEAH SEVEN AND WE- DON'T HAVE. I'M SORRY YOU BROKE UP THERE FOR A MINUTE CAN YOU REPEAT THAT. WE DO HAVE CONSTRAINTS WITHIN OUR PROCESS WE CAN PUT TOGETHER DETAILS AS FAST AS WE CAN AND WE ARE WE'RE DOING THE RESEARCH. WE'RE WE'RE PUTTING IT TOGETHER FOR ALL THE INFORMATION TOGETHER FOR COUNCIL RIGHT NOW. AND WE HAVE ACTUALLY. AND IS THERE IS APPROVAL YOUNG WOMEN ARE COUNCIL IN REHEARSAL ENGLISH PLAN. OKAY NO ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. OKAY THANK YOU I APPRECIATE YOU TAKING THE TIME AND AT LEAST- AS JOINING US THROUGH YOUR YOUR IDEAS AND- I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO SEE TO SEE A PLAN. ON HOW THE FUNDS WILL BE DISTRIBUTED THANK YOU PRITCHETT. WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TOWARDS OUR NEXT- PANEL AND- ISSUE NUMBER NINE. B.

THE TEN MILLION DOLLARS INCLUDES NINE POINT SIX MILLION FOR OUR PRIMARY VENDOR CONTRACT. TWO HUNDRED EIGHT THOUSAND FOR INDEPENDENT VERIFICATION AND VALIDATION CONTRACT AND A HUNDRED AND THIRTEEN THOUSAND FOR THE DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY OVERSIGHT SERVICES. IN REGARDS TO OUR CURRENT PROJECTS STATUS DUE TO COPE WITH IMPACTS WE HAD A EXPERIENCE SCHEDULE DELAYS. NO HOMES HAVE IMPLEMENTED THUS FAR. WE ARE CURRENTLY IN THE PLANNING PHASE. TO DATE NO PAYMENTS AVE BEEN MADE TO THE VENDOR BECAUSE THE INITIAL SET OF DELIVERABLES FOR ALL ZERO COST TO THE REBELS. WE HAVE THE BEST NUMBER TO REACH BASS LINE THE PROJECT SCHEDULE. WE DO EXPECT THAT THIS EFFORT WILL RESULT IN A SPECIAL PROJECT REPORTS SUBMITTED TO THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY AT THIS TIME WE DO NOT KNOW THE FULL IMPACT OF THIS CHANGE. MANORCARE I'M HERE WITH OUR AGENCY INFORMATION OFFICER IS THEM ALL AND WE'RE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU FOR THAT MISSING VIRUS LET'S HEAR FROM MISS BOTTLES BOTTLE SEAL AND MR OSBORNE. EGGMAN BREAKS YOU HAVE WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST OFFICE. I'M AS MENTIONED BY THE DEPARTMENT THEY ARE CURRENTLY LOOKING AT THE POSSIBILITY OF RE BASE LINING THE PROJECT TIMELINE ON WHICH WOULD REQUIRE SUBMITTING A SPECIAL PROJECT REPORT TO THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY.

FORMER FINANCES NO CONCERNS WITH THIS PROJECT AS PRESENTED WE DO RECOGNIZED TIME LINE HAS SLIPPED AND- WE'RE ALSO LOOKING FORWARD TO- GETTING. ONE OF THE PROJECT. NOT BEING SAID WE THINK THAT WE CAN STILL MONEY- OUR BEST UNDERSTANDING IS THAT- IT HASN'T BEEN A COST ISSUE BUT IT'S CHANGED IT'S MORE JUST A DELIVERABLE SCHEDULE OF DELIVERABLES. AND SO WE WERE STILL SUGGEST FULLY FUNDING THE PROJECT THE IDEA THAT THAT MONEY WOULD BE ENCUMBERED IN BUDGET HERE AND THEN WHAT HAPPENED. DIGITAL AMOUNT OF TIME TO EXPAND. THANK YOU FOR THAT MISTER OSBORNE ARE THERE ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. THE YES NO. MISTER AFARIA THANK YOU JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY.

ANYTHING OF INTEREST TO NOTE DURING THIS HEARING- ON NUMBERS AND ACTIVITY AND- GIVEN HOMELESSNESS THE PANDEMIC AND ALL THE DIFFERENT ISSUES THAT ARE HAVE COME ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH RELATED. ARE YOU SEEING A CHANGE IN NUMBERS THAT YOU'D LIKE TO. OFFER OR REPORT ON RIGHT NOW. A CHANGE IN NUMBERS AND- IN REGARDS TO INTERACTIONS HOMES AND THE EFFECTIVE COPING YES YEAH. I WILL NOTE THAT DURING THE INITIATION OF THE PROJECT- WE HAVE- WE DIDN'T EXPECT OUR SUBJECT MATTER EXPERT AVAILABILITY- AND SPECIALLY IN THE AREA OF OUR CLINICIANS BUT TO BE MORE AVAILABLE FOR THE PROJECT UNFORTUNATELY WITH COLD AND THE AND THE PRIORITY OF CARE FOR OUR VETERANS AND RESIDENTS ARE HOMES THAT HAS TAKEN AN IMPACT ON OUR PROJECT AND AFFECTED. OUR DELIVERABLE SCHEDULED OUR OVERALL SCHEDULE I DON'T HAVE SPECIFIC NUMBERS THAT I CAN SHARE RIGHT NOW BUT WE CAN TAKE THAT BACK AND PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BECAUSE COMMITTEE JULY. K.

OKAY OKAY AND HAVE A HAS THERE BEEN VACCINATION ADMINISTRATION STARTED IN THE HOME'S ALREADY THAT. YOU CAN ALSO PROVIDE SOME NUMBERS FOR. SO I DON'T HAVE THE NUMBERS BUT AS PART OF THIS RE BASELINE EFFORT WE'RE LOOKING AT IT IS THAT YES THE VACCINATION SCHEDULE IN THE HOMES HAS THE ROUND ONE AROUND TO MOVE ON TO A VACCINATIONS. OCCURRED IN THE HOMES AND WE GET THROUGH THOSE THOSE VACCINATIONS THAT AND NOT ONLY JUST THE SECOND VACCINATION BUT ALSO THE TIME TO PUT THOSE TO BECOME A FACTOR THAT AT THAT POINT. IN OUR PROJECT SCHEDULE WE'D BE ABLE TO. PLAN FOR MORE AVAILABILITY FOR THE SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT- THERE ARE SPECIFIC DELIVERABLES THAT WE- THAT WE CAN INPUT FROM pAND TRAINING- THAT WE TO WANT TO MAKE SURE WE TAKE INTO ACCOUNT. OUR SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS IN THE HOMES SO THAT WE DON'T. MOVE TOO FAR DOWN ON OUR TIMELINE. WITHOUT THEIR PARTICIPATION. BUT AS THOSE VACCINATIONS OCCUR WE DO EXPECT THAT AVAILABILITY OPEN. K. IF I CAN ASK YOU TO FOLLOW. SIR WITH SOMEBODY ELSE GONNA MAKE COMMENT.

ALSO ALTHOUGH AND IT SEEMS THE WE'RE GETTING SOME THERE'S ANOTHER MIKE THAT'S ON OR YOU'RE HEARING TWO DIFFERENT VOICES JUST ONE MOMENT WHILE WE FIGURE THAT PIECE OUT WE'RE GOOD WE'RE GOOD TO GO OKAY MISTER CAN YOU MAY CONTINUE. MEMBERS SO AS WE SEE A NEW BUILDINGS ARE FINISHING THIS SPRING AND SUMMER- WE HAVE A ONCE IN A LIFETIME OPPORTUNITY TO RENOVATE THE PROPOSED BUILDINGS AT THE SO THAT'S REALLY NEAT- AS A TESTIFIED BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE IN PRIOR YEARS. WHAT'S PROPOSED IS A COMPREHENSIVE RENOVATION OF THESE THREE HISTORIC BUILDINGS WHICH ARE IN THE TOP FIVE. MOST EFFICIENT INFRASTRUCTURE. IN OUR PORTFOLIO THE NECESSARY SKILLS WORKING CLUES THE REPLACEMENT OF EVERY MAJOR BUILDING SYSTEMS INCLUDING ELEVATORS PLUMBING HEATING VENTILATION AIR CONDITIONING ELECTRICAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND SECURITY. AS WELL AS SOME CRITICAL FIRE LIFE SAFETY ISSUES SUCH AS FIRE SPRINKLERS EXITING STANDARDS- ALL SYSTEMS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY BEYOND THEIR USEFUL LIFE IN DANGER OF FAILING. I WITH THE BATES SEVEN HUNDRED BUILDINGS PARTICULAR HAVING EXTERIOR WATER ISSUES THAT THE BUILDINGS INTO DANGER OF FALLING INTO A STATE OF PERMANENT THIS REPAIR. I WILL ALSO BE ADDRESSING A SEVERE SEISMIC DEFICIENCY IN THE RESOURCES BUILDING. WHICH WOULD REQUIRE REPLACING THE EXTERIOR SKIN OF THE BUILDING. I'M AT THE GYM TO NOTICE THESE THREE PROJECTS HAVE THEIR INITIAL PHASE AUTHORIZED BY THE LEGISLATURE IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN- WE COMPLETED THAT PHASE BUT PLACE THE BUILDINGS AND THE PROJECTS ON BECAUSE OF THE LAST BUDGET CYCLE. TO ENSURE THE TELEWORK HAD NO IN ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE PROJECTS WHICH WE HAVE DONE. I'M NOT ONLY ARE ALL THREE PROJECTS MORE THAN CAPABLE OF SUPPORTING THE TELEWORK PLANS OF THE FUTURE TENANTS. OF THE RENOVATIONS ARE IN LINE WITH INDUSTRY GUIDANCE DESIGN GUIDANCE OUT OF SCOPE OF BUILDINGS- THESE PROJECTS FOR THE SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE LOCAL ECONOMY AT A TIME WHEN PEOPLE AND BUSINESSES ARE SUFFERING. THESE PROJECTS WORK DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY CREATE THOUSANDS OF JOBS AND THE PROJECT READY PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENTS ALL CONSTRUCTION JOBS WILL PROVIDE A LIVING WAGE AS WELL AS THE SKILLS AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR A LIFETIME OF WORK. ADDITIONALLY THESE THESE PROJECTS WILL INCLUDE A COMMUNITY WORKFORCE AGREEMENTS. WHICH BRINGS A FOCUS ON EQUITY AND FUTURE EMPLOYMENT THAT IS YOU'RE IN HER FOR STATE PROJECTS. TO QUICK FINAL NOTES- THE JESSIE I'M REBUILDING DOES HAVE A HISTORIC FOUNTAIN JUST OUTSIDE OF IT AS MENTIONED IN YOUR GENDER. WE HAVE TAKEN A DO NOTHING APPROACH WITH THE FOUNTAIN YOU'RE. NOT REQUESTING MONEY IN A PROPER FOR. OTHERS FUNDING FOR. TO DEMOLISH IT OR TO READ IT- IF YOU MAY. A PUBLIC. I BELIEVE LETTERS MAY HAVE GONE TO SOME OF YOUR- WERE. THAT THE STOCK. AT FUNDING RENOVATE FOUND. WELL WE NOT. DOING WE IT THE- HAVE LOVED. WE WERE IF WE WERE ASKED TO RENOVATE IT- AND THEN FINALLY THE CHEN ALSO MAY. CONCERT BY THE TRICK IS TREASURER. WHO IS THE- AND RUBIO- AS THE AGENDA MENTIONED HAVE A LETTER THE TREASURE. WE HAD A VERY. CONVERSATION TREASURE AND HER STAFF OR ADDRESS. THIS CONCERT ABOUT THE PROJECT INCLUDING. THE SEVERITY OF THE BUILDING ISSUES AND THE FACT THAT WE ARE ABSOLUTELY NOT DESIGNING THIS USING. PANDEMIC STANDARDS I WITH A COPY OF OUR RESPONSES. WAS SENT TO YOUR OFFICE. ARMED WITH THAT I AM HAPPY TO AN ANY. YOU. SORRY LET'S HEAR FROM AT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AS WELL AS THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. L. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- GOOD AFTERNOON- I JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THESE PROJECTS- DURING INCLUDED IN THE ADMINISTRATION'S PLAN OR CONTINUATION OF THE COMMITMENT TO INVESTING IN STATE INFRASTRUCTURE AS A DRIVER OF ECONOMIC STIMULUS AND BE HAPPY TO. ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT THINK. L. SORT OF BORED LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WE HAVE NOT IDENTIFIED ANY CONCERNS WITH THE PROPOSAL FOR THE THREE BUILDINGS OR THE FIRE SAFETY MODIFICATIONS WE ARE CONTINUING TO EXAMINE THE PROPOSAL FOR FACILITY MAINTENANCE STAFF HOWEVER AND WE WILL UPDATE THE COMMITTEE IF WE IDENTIFY ANY CONCERNS. THANK YOU TO THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. NOW I ACTUALLY HAVE A COUPLE PERHAPS- DO YOU EXPECT- AND THIS IS FOR MR KENNY DO YOU EXPECT TO ALTER THE LAYOUT OR DESIGN ELEMENTS FOR THESE NEW FACILITIES BASED ON THE EXPERIENCE OF COALBED. NINETEEN FOR EXAMPLE WILL OFFICES BE SET UP ASSUMING THAT EMPLOYEES ARE TELEWORKING OR PARTICIPATING IN VIRTUAL MEETINGS. SO I GUESS SHE POINTS IN THAT THERE'S A BEGINNING TO BE MORE MORE INDUSTRY DESIGN GUIDANCE ON WHAT A POST CODE THE BUILDING THAT LOOKS LIKE- MOSADDEK GUIDANCE ALIGNS WITH. THE TRADITIONAL YOU KNOW LAST FIVE OR SIX YEARS OR SO HEALTHY BUILDING STANDARDS- WHICH WE ADOPTED ACTUALLY IN TWENTY SIXTEEN- SO. KIND OF FORWARD THINKING WE ARE OUR BUILDINGS ALREADY ATTACHED TO MUCH OF WHAT THE ISSUE GUIDANCE IS- BUT MORE THAN THAT- WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT AS A RENOVATING THESE BUILDINGS. AND CONSTRUCTING NEW BUILDINGS AND EXIT TWO YEARS TELEWORK WAS GONNA BE MORE MORE OF A THING. NO ONE COULD EVER IMAGINE HAPPENING QUITE SO QUICKLY- BUT WE KNEW IT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN EVENTUALLY INSTALL THE BUILDINGS THAT WE HAVE EITHER BUILT OR ARE PLANNED FOR INNOVATION HAVE HAD. TELL WORKING PEOPLE FOCUS A SIMPLE EXAMPLE IS RIGHT DOWN THE STREET FROM THE CAPITOL THERE'S THE NEW NATURAL RESOURCES BUILDING. THAT BUILDING WILL BE CONSTRUCTED IN JULY- IT WAS ORIGINALLY DESIGNED WITH THIRTY TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY SEATS- AND- IT WILL STILL HAVE THIRTY TWO HUNDRED FIFTY SEATS BUT FOUR THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED EACH EMPLOYEES IN ITS- ALL- ADOPTED. TELEWORK IT WE DID COST US NOTHING TO MAKE THOSE CHANGES THAT IT WAS JUST A MATTER OF SORT OF REARRANGING WHO WHEN WHERE AND WHEN PEOPLE INCOME ALTERNATE PIECES WHICH YOU CAN NOW CUTS. SO YES I DID ANYTHING WITH THAT THE TIME IS WHAT I DO TO THE TELEWORK. WILL WILL BE ABLE TO CONTACT. THANK YOU ACROSS ON THE FOUNTAIN CAN YOU PER MORE AND- REGARDING THE STATE. FOUND YES SO- ACROSS THE STREET FROM THE CAP- BETWEEN NINE TEN- YOU HAVE THE JESSIE I'M REBUILDING AND YOU HAVE TO LIVE RECORDS BUILDING IN BETWEEN IS AROUND ABOUT- WITH A HISTORIC WRITTEN. THAT HISTORIC FOUNTAIN AND- IS PART OF THE HISTORIC DISTRICT ITSELF- ORIGINALLY WHEN WE HAD TO BE DONE GOING THROUGH THE ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW FOR THE PROJECT. WE TYPICALLY TAKE A WORST CASE SCENARIO APPROACH- ENTITLED THE WORST POSSIBLE THING. THAT WHAT IF SOMETHING WERE TO HAPPEN THE PROJECT WE OUGHT TO GO BACK OUT AND YOU STUFF TO PROVIDE DRUG USING BECAUSE ANYTHING- UNTIL WE HAD ORIGINALLY PROPOSED A DEMOLITION OPTION I GET NOT TO SAY THAT WE WOULD ACTUALLY DEMOLISH IT BUT- WE DID PROPOSE THAT AND THE ENVIRONMENTAL DOCUMENT- WE IT COSTS ABOUT A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS PLUS OR MINUS TWO TO POLISH THE FOUNTAIN- CONSIDERING THE SUBSTANTIAL UNDERGROUND INFRASTRUCTURE THAT GOES ALONG WITH IT- AND THEN TO RESTORE. AROUND ABOUT TO GET SOME SOME NEW. FEATURE R. N. ROUGHLY OUR CIVIL ABOUT TWO MILLION DOLLARS TO RESTORE IT. ITS FULL FUNCTIONALITY THERE IS MULTIPLE COMPONENTS IN THE FOUNTAIN AND EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM WITHOUT FAIL IS BROKEN IN SOME WAY SHAPE OR FORM- AND SO- WE DELIVER. TAKEN OUT I DO A WITH- WE- DIDN'T THINK- THE ADDED MONEY TO RESTORE THE- WAS THAT WE WOULD. ASK FOR- NOR DO WE RECKON DEMOLITION OF THIS. AND THAT'S KIND OF WHERE WE SET. M. BUT THEN THAT THE IT'S AN A- DOES THIS REPAIR YES THANK YOU MISTER LAAKIIN- THAT IT WAS ALLOWED TO GET TO THE POINT OF WHERE IT IS NOW THAT'S VERY UNFORTUNATE. ON A SEPARATE ISSUE- ISSUE HAVING TO DO WITH THE TREASURER'S OFFICE HAVE YOU MET HAS YOUR DEPARTMENT MET WITH THE TREASURER'S OFFICE STAFF ABOUT THE CONCERNS RAISED IN HER LETTER. YES YES ABSOLUTELY- WE MET WITH THE TERMS REMARKS- AND MEMBERS OF OUR STAFF- RECENTLY LAST WEEK WE'VE ACTUALLY BEEN WORKING WITH THE TREASURER'S OFFICE SINCE- EARLY TWENTY NINETEEN ON THE PROJECT- WE GOT HER LETTER- WHEN YOU GUYS DID. WE SET DOWN WITH HER KIND OF WALK THROUGH THERE ARE A NUMBER OF MISCONCEPTIONS- AND THINGS WE WERE HAPPY TO CLARIFY- FOR EXAMPLE THAT WE ARE DESIGNING A BUILDING BASED ON PRE MED AND EXTENDERS THAT DESIGN IS NOT DONE THAT BASED ON THE- RECENT OBVIOUSLY WHAT THE BUILDINGS GOING TO FUNCTION. WE LOOK LIKE IN THE FUTURE OF THOSE SORTS OF THINGS- THEY ALSO RAISING CONCERNS ABOUT- THERE ARE POTENTIAL RELOCATION PARTISAN BUILDING BE CLARIFIED THAT THAT BUILDING IS. NOT ENOUGH WERE STATED THAT THE- REBUILDING THAT'S WHY WERE YOU CAN RENOVATE THE I'M BUILDING UP UNDERSTAND- BUT WE ALSO PROMISED TO WORK TOGETHER WITH. YOU TRYING TO THE- BUT THE BEST RELOCATION SPACE FOR THEM- WE DID MENTION THOUGH OF COURSE THAT WE PICKED UP UNDERSTAND BUILDING- IN PART BECAUSE WE ARE. SPLITTING UP A LITTLE BIT BUTALSO TO. BE LEAST COST IMPACTFUL MOVE FOR THEM AND WHAT ACTUALLY STATE THAT WE SHOULD SAVE THEM SOME MONEY ON THERE AND WILL. ALWAYS. BUDGET THEY WERE. THANK YOU FOR THAT ADDITIONAL COMMENTS ARE. FROM COME. NO LOOKING ON MEDICARE DO YOU MIND IF I. BETTER CHESMA ALLEGRI AHEAD. COME APPRECIATE THE PRESENT I WANT TO GO THE TRACK LETTER- AND IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'VE HAD SOME CA. WITH THE TREE TO- THERE WAS ONE L. OF A LETTER THAT YOU DIDN'T TOUCH ON WHICH WERE THE BUDGET CONSIDERATIONS AND- WHAT- TREASURE MOD LAYS OUT UNDER LETTER WAS SENT ORIGINALLY- THE BUDGET FOR THIS BUILDING WAS NINETY MILLION THAT INCREASED MILLION. ORIGINALLY WAS SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY PER SQUARE FOOT NOW IT'S OVER A THOUSAND DOLLARS PER SQUARE FOOT AND WHAT SHE HIGHLIGHTS IS DURING THIS TIME GIVEN THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF THE PANDEMIC. MANY PEOPLE ARE FACING UNPRECEDENTED DISRUPTIONS TO THEIR LIVES INCLUDING STATE EMPLOYEES HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO PAY CUTS EXCEPT TRUCK TO PROCEED WHICH SUCH A LARGE SCALE EXPENSIVE RNOVATION PROJECT- MAY CAUSE INDIVIDUALS TO QUESTION OUR STATE'S PRIORITIES DURING THIS UNCERTAIN FISCAL TIME COULD YOU ADDRESS THAT- I HAVE TO ADMIT I READ THAT IT. JUMPED OUT AT ME- AND I'D. BE CURIOUS TO KNOW WHAT YOUR PERSPECTIVE IS ON THAT. YEAH ABSOLUTELY- SO COME POINTS IN RESPONSE- AND ALL THIS BE COMMUNICATED TO THE TREASURES WHILE- PERSON FOREMOST- SHE IS RIGHT ABOUT THE PERCENTAGE CLIMBS- OF THE PROJECT I CAN EXPLAIN THAT A SECOND- WE DID POINT OUT. THAT THERE'S A REASON WHY YOU DON'T USE. THAT SQUARE FOOTAGE AS THE COST BASIS- GENERALLY FOR RENOVATIONS NEW CONSTRUCTION USE GROSS- BECAUSE IT JUST LOOKS LIKE THAT YOUR FLIGHT THE COST OF COURSE BUT WHEN HE SAID THAT- TO THE COSTS ARE ACTUALLY LOWER THAN STATED. ON A SQUARE FOOTAGE BASIS BUT THE COSTS HAVE INCREASED AND THE PERCENTAGES ARE ABOUT RIGHT- THERE A COUPLE OF REASONS FOR THAT- FIRST AND FOREMOST- CONTEST CONDITIONS SO- THE PROJECTS IN IN THE LATE- ONE YEAR. HAVE GONE UP THE DIRECT COST OF GOING UP 5% PLUS- ON THE BASIS. INDIRECT COSTS THAT GO ALONG WITH IT- AND SO YOU END UP HAVING DESIGN FEES WHICH ARE PERCENTAGE- YOUR PRODUCT. TO CONTINUE TO SEE WHICH IS THE PERCENTAGE. INSPECTION WHICH- SO THE DIRECT COSTS OF GOING SO HOW THOSE FEES. WITH OTHER- COUPLE OF A GENERAL. IN TERMS OF PRICE COSTS IN. EIGHT NINETY THE PROJECT FOR WAS FIRST PUT FORWARD- THEY WERE BASED ON OF- INFRASTRUCTURE STUDIES WERE EXT. THE TIME- WE ALSO USED LIBRARY COURTS AN- PROJECT WHICH IS ACROSS THE STREET FROM PINE RIVER AS A COST BASIS FOR TWO OF THEM- BACK. TO BE A MISTAKE HE- LIBRARY COURTS ANNEX ACTUALLY PROVED TO BE A PARTIAL RENOVATION WHICH WE DID NOT REALIZE- AND SO WHEN YOU ALIGN THE SCOPE. OF THE LIBRARY COURTS RENOVATION TO WHAT WE HAVE TO DO THESE BUILDINGS BECAUSE ACTUALLY MATERIAL HE- MATCHED THE PROBLEM IS OF COURSE IS THAT WE JUST PICK THE COR ANALOG BEGIN WITH. UNDERESTIMATED THE COSTS THE SECOND PLEASE- THAT WAS AS WE GOT THE FUNDING LEGISLATURE IN EIGHTEEN NINETY BEGIN TO DO. MORE UPDATED- BUILDING INVESTIGATIONS- WHAT WE GENERALLY FOUND WORK CONDITIONS THAT HAD- XCELERATED LEE GOTTEN WORSE- AND NEW BUILDING CONDITIONS THAT EXIST FOR. A REALLY SIMPLE EXAMPLE I THINK IS- THE- THE RESOURCES BUILDING SO WE KNEW THE BUILDING HAD A SEISMIC ISSUE WE HAD IT. FOR BUT DIGGING INTO SOME OF THE SPECIFICS AND THE EXTENT OF IT- WE FOUND WE HAVE TO. REMOVE THE ENTIRE EXTERIOR CLADDING OF THE BUILDING- AS WELL AS CHORE UP THE ENTIRE INTERIOR STRUCTURAL SYSTEM IS A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT SEISMIC ISSUE- SOME OF THOSE IT WORSENING CONDITIONS. HAVE DRIVEN UP THE COSTS OF. IF I COULD I UNDERSTAND NOW WHY THE IS GOING UP MY REAL QUESTION IS NOW THE RIGHT TIME FOR US SPEND ON TWENTY MY- DOLLARS. ON THIS WEEK THAT'S THAT'S REALLY WHAT THIS IS THAT'S REALLY WHAT ARE. THAT'S WHAT CALIFORNIA'S ARE GONNA BE ASKING US. AND I WOULD I WOULD MAKE THE- THAT THAT YES- THESE PROJECTS- COMBINED WILL ADD A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT INTO THE LOCAL ECONOMY- THE UNDER PROJECT A LOCAL CREATE SOMEWHERE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THREE HUNDRED JOBS PER YEAR DIRECTLY PLUS INDIRECT BENEFITS- IN A GENERALLY SPEAKING IT'S EVERY ONE DOLLAR YOU CAN INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS TO GET THREE DOLLARS. OF ECONOMIC BENEFIT FROM IT. THESE PROJECTS HAVE BOTH PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENTS AND COMMUNITY WORKFORCE AGREEMENTS. IT'S NOT JUST YOU KNOW. BOTTOM LOW PAYING JOBS THESE ARE JOBS THAT HAVE FUTURES WITH THEM- AND CAN YOU WORKFORCE AGREEMENTS HAVE A FOCUS ON EQUITY WHICH WHICH- WE HAVE WE'VE NEVER DONE OUTSIDE OF THE SACRAMENTO PROJECTS- AND SO I THINK THERE ISN'T. AN ABSOLUTE ECONOMIC ARGUMENTS BEING MADE HERE THESE ARE ALSO- FINANCE PROJECT FINANCE PROJECTS. WOULD YOU GENERAL FUND CASH TO. PAY FOR THE CONSTRUCTION. WE'RE JUST DOING SOME OUTSIDE LITERALLY JUST DIVIDED THREE HUNDRED AND TO HUNDRED THE MILLION. IT COMES OUT TO FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE. DOLLARS PR JOB I ASSUME IS NOT WHAT YOU ARE PAYING FOLKS SO AGAIN JUST TRYING TO THINK OF THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF THIS DURING THIS ECONOMY WE HAVE SCARCE DOLLARS. DOESN'T MAKE SENSE FOR US TO MOVE FOR WITH THIS PROJECT RIGHT NOW. YEAH THAT'S THAT'S THE THAT'S THE DIRECT- JOB. DOES NOT COUNT THE INDIRECT JOBS OF THE SUPPLY CHAINS THAT YOU'RE PURCHASING AS WELL- THERE'S GENERAL INDUSTRY STUDIES AGAIN FOR EVERY ONE DOLLAR YOU PUT ANY TEND TO GET THREE DOLLARS OUT ECONOMICALLY FROM. PROJECTS LIKE THESE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER TO FIGHT I CAN JUST ADD TO MISTER KENNEY'S COMMENTS- YOU'LL NOTICE THAT. ADMINISTRATION HAS COME OUT PRETTY ADAMANTLY ON IN FAVOR OF. INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS- IS STRONG DRIVERS OF ECONOMIC ECONOMIC STIMULUS I ALLUDED TO THAT A FEW MINUTES AGO. AND THIS IS ONE OF MANY PROJECTS THE ADMINISTRATION WILL BE BRINGING FORWARD IN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS ON THE- JOB CREATION AND ECONOMIC STIMULUS IN MIND IN FACT WE HAVE A FIFTY TWO BILLION DOLLAR. FIVE YEAR ON PRESCRIPTION PLAN. THAT THAT THE ADMINISTRATORS VERY SUPPORT OF THAT CAN IN THE SAME VEIN OF JOB CREATION AND ON ECONOMIC. STIMULUS CALIFORNIA. I PREFER THE AYE AYE LOVE TO SEIZE OF THAT AND- AS THE CHAIR THAT COMMITTEE. IF I HAD A HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION I FOR OUT BILTMORE HOUSING TO PUT ROOFS OVER PEOPLE'S HEADS WHILE CREATING JOBS. I UNDERSTAND THIS IS SOMETHING WE NEED TO DO WE JUST AGAIN THINK ABOUT THE TIMING SO I APPRECIATE THE APPRECIATE THAT THE- CONVERSATION AND- I'LL TURN IT BACK TO THE CHAIR. THANK YOU MANAGER. THANK YOU FOR THAT MISTER TO ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. NO I WOULD JUST ADD THAT THERE IS A THE LEGISLATURE IS INVESTED IN ENSURING THAT IN OUR CO BID. AT A CON MI RECOVERY PLAN WE ARE CREATING GOOD JOBS GOOD UNION JOBS INFRASTRUCTURE IS ALWAYS A GOOD DIRECTION AND HOW TO GET TO THAT- THAT GOAL IN ADDITION TO ENSURING THAT WE DON'T ALLOW THINGS LIKE. THE FOUNTAIN TO CONTINUE TO BE IN DISARRAY OR ANY ADDITIONAL BUILDINGS TO CONTINUE TO FALL APART THAT ARE STILL QUITE NEEDED FOR US TO BE ABLE TO DO THE BUSINESS OF THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU TO THE PANEL. IF THERE ARE NO ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS OR CONCERNS FROM THE COMMITTEE WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE ON OKAY THANK YOU WE ARE NOW ON ISSUE.

I'M TOO NUMBER FOURTEEN DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY UPDATE BUDGET REQUESTS- THAT THEIR PANELISTS FOR THIS ONE ARE JUST IN A CO HAND SHAPIRO WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY. WITH HELLO MY GOODNESS VITALY. A I'M JUST GOING TO HAVE YOU HELP ME WITH YOUR LAST NAME ALTHOUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY ANDREAS SPIERS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY- AND THE WARDEN. BRIAN METZGER EVELYN ASSIDUOUS AND RYAN LINDBERG THANK YOU WE CAN BEGIN WITH MISTER COLEMAN SHAPIRO- ACTUALLY- MADAM CHAIR THIS IS A NISSAN AND THE DIRECTOR OF CALIFORNIA FROM THE TECHNOLOGY AND I'M GONNA GO AHEAD AND KICK THIS OFF AND- AND THEN I TURNED IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUES.

I'M SORRY YEAH I DON'T THINK WITH- YEAH THAT THAT THE UPDATE THAT I GOT THAT I WAS ON THE AGENDA SO I'M COLLEGE EYES BUT THAT MAKES THE BIG THAT WAS IN ON- BUT I'LL QUICKLY HANDED OFF- TO WHAT JUSTIN.

TO STABILIZE THE STATE- KNOWLEDGE SYSTEM. YEAH I'M FROM. MY TO INFRASTRUCTURE TO SYSTEMS THAT ARE CRITICAL TO BUSINESS. ANY ADDITION TO THAT THERE'S ALSO- A PORTION THAT THE SUPPORTING THAT- EXTENDED RESPONSIBILITY FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE STATE BROADBAND PLAN- BOTH OF THESE PROPOSALS ARE CONSISTENT WITH- THE NEW VISION TWENTY TWENTY THREE. THAT THE DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY HAVE PUT FORWARD- ON JANUARY FIFTEENTH. THE NEW THREE YEAR STRATEGIC PLAN FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND WITH THAT- I COULD EITHER HAND OFF TO JUSTIN QUESTION PROPUESTAS CHIEF STRATEGIST. TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE MORE INSIGHTS TO THE VISION TWENTY TWENTY THREE OR WE CAN TAKE QUESTION ON THE PACIFIC FIRST BEFORE WE GO INTO. THE VISION. GREAT THANK YOU MISS TOM. GO AHEAD PLEASE. ALL RIGHT NOT JUST. MADAM CHAIR MY NAME'S CRUNCH PARO THE CHEAP STRATEGIST AT THE PARK TECHNO AND SO- WE PUT TOGETHER THESE TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY OBVIOUSLY IN THE CONTEXT OF KOPEN- WITH THE INSPIRATION THAT WE WANT TECHNOLOGY TO POWER COMPASSIONATE IN TEAMCENTER GOVERNMENT- COBIT HAS VERY MUCH REMINDED US OF THE FRAGILITY OF COMMUNITIES BUSINESSES LIVES AND SHOWN WHERE WE MUST PREPARE BETTER AND BE MORE RESILIENT TO MEET THE MOMENT WHEN IT COMES. IN SO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT WE DID TO BE ABLE TO PUT THIS PLAN TOGETHER A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT WE LEARNED AND WHAT'S IN THE PLAN ITSELF AND I'LL BE BRIEF. I'M FIRST IS THAT WE THE PLANS RESULT OF UNPRECEDENTED PARTICIPATION DURING A NEW CURRENTLY HARD TIME. BUT WE DID SIXTY ONE ON ONE INTERVIEWS WITH AGENCY AND DEPARTMENTAL LEADERS- WE ENGAGED LEGISLATIVE STAFF SO MANY FOLKS THAT ARE ON COMMITTEE STAFF HERE. THE L. A. O. WITH THE POTENTIAL BRANCH AS WELL AS MEMBERS FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT. WE ENGAGE THE PRIVATE SECTOR- BOTH. YOU KNOW FOUR HUNDRED DIFFERENT- TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA 30% OF WHICH I'D NEVER DONE STATE. WORK BEFORE- SURVEYED STAFF THERE ON THE FRONT LINES OF DELIVERING SERVICES TO THE PUBLIC AS WELL AS OUR A. I. O. IN CIO COMMUNITY IN THE DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND. SOME OF THE PAIN POINTS AND OPPORTUNITIES. WE REPEATED A BUNCH OF THE CASE HISTORY- BOTH ABOUT WHAT FOLKS HAVE DONE WELL IN OTHER PLACES. AS WELL AS WHAT WE'VE LEARNED FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND THEN RAN INTO A CROSS US OF BUILDING OUT THE PLAN ITSELF INCLUDING GATHERING SOME FEEDBACK FROM. STAFF OF THIS COMMITTEE AS. WELL AS THE L. A. L. AS WE WERE FINALIZED. SO COUPLE THINGS THAT WE LEARN. FROM ONE OF THAT KOBE SHOWN THAT WE PAY PER. IN AND REALLY TAKE- DIRECTOR TELLING MYSELF FOR. SPONSORED MAXINE'S BUT THAT'S OBVIOUSLY NOT ENOUGH WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE GETTING AHEAD OF PROBLEMS- THAT WE'RE SOLVING PROBLEMS TOGETHER WITH THE RIGHT FOLKS IN THE ROOM- AND MAKING SURE THAT WE'VE GOT. EASIER AND FASTER WAYS TO GET STARTED. AND SO WITH THAT IN MIND- WE PUT OUT THREE GUIDING PRINCIPLES TO GUIDE THE WAY THAT WE USE TECHNOLOGY IN THE STATE- WHICH ONE OF WHICH WOULD BE A TREMENDOUS SURPRISE THE FIRST IS. PUTTING PEOPLE FIRST SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE PUTTING BOTH THE RESIDENTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AS WELL AS THE FOLKS THAT ARE ON THE FRONT LINES OF DELIVERING SERVICES TO. THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA FIRST AS WE ARE MAKING TECHNOLOGY DECISIONS. SECOND IS WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THEY WERE MAKING CONTINUOUS TIMELY IMPROVEMENTS SO IT'S NOT ENOUGH THAT WE'RE JUST GETTING BETTER. WE NEED TO GET BTTER SO THAT WE ARE DELIVERING THE SERVICE THAT IS NEEDED AT THE TIME THAT I JUST NEEDED TO- AND THE THIRD IS WORKING TOGETHER IT'S WORKING ALONE AND SO WE'VE SEEN THIS A LOT IN THE CONTEXT OF THE PANDEMIC- EVEN OUTSIDE. AND DEMOCRATS TAXED WHERE WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE'RE PUTTING THE RIGHT FOLKS AROUND THE TABLE TO SOLVE COMMON CHALLENGES THAT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TECHNOLOGY WHERE WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT. WE HAVE POLICY AND OPERATIONS. TOGETHER WITH TECHNOLOGY IN THE DATA AS WE ARE DECIDING. HOW TO BUILD SOMETHING THAT IS GOING TO SUPPORT A PARTICULAR SERVICE. AND THREE ARTICULATED FIVE FIVE. GOALS ON THAT WERE DRIVING TOWARDS MUSIC THESE ARE. TIMELESS GOALS. THE FIRST IS MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE DELIVERING EASY TO USE FAST DEPENDABLE AND SECURE PUBLIC SERVICES. AND SO YOU KNOW IF YOU COULD TALK TO ME TWO YEARS AGO BEFORE THE PANDEMIC I MIGHT TO FOCUS MORE ON THE EASY TO USE AND FAST- AND I THINK. QUITE CLEARLY IN THE LAST. YEAR DEPENDABLE AND SECURE HAS BEEN- AN INCREASING FOCUS. AND YOU KNOW HONESTLY WE'VE DONE A LOT OF REACTION AND THAT'S CRITICAL IT'S CRITICAL THAT WHEN SOMETHING FAILS OR WHEN SOMETHING NEEDS TO HAPPEN WE GO AND WE FIX THINGS. BUT AS DIRECTOR TOM MENTIONED EARLIER WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE WE'RE GETTING AHEAD OF THAT MORE PREVENTING ISSUES BEFORE THEY BECOME FIRES THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS IN REAL TIME. AND SO WITH THAT THAT'S YOUR VERY MUCH SEARCHING OUT THE BUDGET PROPOSAL. AROUND TAKING PREVENTIVE ACTION AROUND THE BOOKS CRITICAL SERVICES THAT THE STATE PROVIDES. ON THE SECOND GOAL IS AROUND MAKING SURE THAT OUR PUBLIC ARE EQUITY INCLUDE. I'M IN THE I LIKE TO USE HERE- ACTUALLY IN THAT- KRISTIN GRIFFIN ACT US A QUOTE WE WERE WRITING TO THIS REPORT- WHERE SAID IF IT SOUNDS SOMETIMES LIKE WE ARE DESIGNING SERVICES FOR A YOU KNOW AN UPPER MIDDLE CLASS WHITE PERSON WITH A POSTGRADUATE DEGREE- AND THE REALITY IS THAT YOU KNOW GOVERNMENT HAS A CRITICAL ROLE TO PLAY FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS AND SO WE NEED TO AND FOR THAT THINGS LIKE A READABILITY- ARE NOT A POSTGRADUATE LEVEL WHICH MANY OF OUR WEBSITES AND SERVICES ARE. AND WE NEED TO DO THE HARD WORK OF SIMPLIFYING AND DRIVE AND ACCESSIBILITY NOT JUST IN TERMS OF COMPLIANCE BUT IN TERMS OF THE ACTUAL EXPERIENCE THAT PEOPLE HAVE. THE THIRD- BIG GO IS ROW MAKING. TECHNOLOGY TO ACCESS USE AND SHARE AND REUSE ACROSS GOVERNMENT. AN EXAMPLE I LIKE TEACHERS HERE- IS AROUND DIGITAL IDENTIFICATION- TO RIGHT NOW. IDENTIFICATION IS A PROBLEM THAT WE SOLVE DOZENS OF TIMES ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE EXPERIENCE OF A INDIVIDUAL CALIFORNIAN TRYING TO. SOMETHING FROM THEIR GOVERNMENT THEY HAVE TO HAVE DIFFERENT LOGGINS FOR DIFFERENT SERVICES SOMETIMES EVEN WITHIN THE SAME DEPARTMENTS. AND SO IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY ABOUT SAYING OKA RATHER THAN FIGURING OUT THE YOU KNOW TRYING TO SOLVE THAT PROBLEM IN A DEPARTMENT BY DEPARTMENT OR PROGRAM BY PROGRAM BASIS ONE OF THE WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN ACTUALLY LEVERAGE THE SCALE OF THE STATE AND SOLVE THAT PROBLEM FEDERATED WAY. SO WE'RE NOT SAYING HEY THERE'S ONE FOR ONE SORT OF SOLUTION THAT FITS ALL CASES BUT WE'RE AT LEAST FEDERATING AND MAKING SURE THAT THESE THINGS WORK TOGETHER TO IMPROVE USER EXPERIENCE IMPROVE OUR USE. OF THE TAXPAYERS RESOURCES. THE FOURTH GOAL IS AROUND BUILDING DIGITAL GOVERNMENT MORE QUICKLY MORE EFFECTIVELY AND SERVICE THESE ARE THINGS LIKE WE PUT A LOT ABOUT WRITTEN REPLACE PROJECTS OVER THE YEARS. I'M ONE OF THE THINGS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE GETTING BETTER AT ISN'T MODERNIZING LEGACY INFRASTRUCTURE WITHOUT REPLACE SO THINKING ABOUT. SORT OF NEW NOVEL PATTERSON CASE HISTORIES ABOUT HOW WE CAN USE THINGS LIKE THE STRANGLER PATTERN TO BE ABLE TO SLOWLY TRANSITION AWAY. UP TO ENABLE MORE ITERATIVE PROGRESS. AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST- BUILDING CONFIDENT EMPOWERED MULTI DISCIPLINARY TEAMS AND SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE CREATING THE RIGHT SPACES TO BRING THE BEST OF THE RELEVANT DISCIPLINES TO THE TABLE AND THAT'S IMPORTANT AT A LEADERSHIP LEVEL SO THAT WE KNOW WHAT TABLES TO SET. AS WELL AS A TEAM IN THE INDIVIDUAL LEVELS. AND SO WE ARTICULATED AND PUT THIS OUT THERE FOR ANY MEMBERS INTERESTED OR ANY MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC IS INTERESTED YOU CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION AT FIFTEEN TWENTY TWENTY THREE DOT C. T. DOT CA DOT GOV. AND WE PUT OUT SPECIFIC CHALLENGES UNDERNEATH THESE GOALS PRECISELY TO HARNESS AND SOLICIT INVOLVEMENT IDEAS. ACROSS THE TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND STATE STAFF LOCAL GOVERNMENT PUBLIC AND OUR COWORKERS- TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE LEVERAGING THE BEST INFORMATION OUT. THERE TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS AT HAND. THANK YOU JUSTIN- I'M SURE IN. OF ACCOUNT WITHOUT WORLD TO ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU FOR THAT. ARE THERE ANY MEMBERS OF THE PANEL WITH QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. HELLO MR CHU IS WAITING ON THE LINE MISTER TO GO AHEAD. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- LET ME JUST START BY BY THANKING- D. T. FOR YOUR PRESENTATION AND- YOU KNOW I THINK YOU HAVE HEARD ME. IN THIS COMMITTEE OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS TALK ABOUT THE MANY I. T. FIASCOS THAT HAVE PLAGUED STATE GOVERNMENT- WE'RE ALL VERY FAMILIAR WITH THAT WHAT'S HAPPENED AT THE DMV. AT DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS AT U. D. D. E. WITH A SCHOLAR WITH VACCINATION SOFTWARE I CAN GO ON AND ON- ONE OF THE THINGS I'D LIKE TO ASK- TO DIRECTOR TONG. COULD YOU LAY OUT FOR US SORT OF THE ROLE OF YOUR DEPARTMENT WHEN IT COMES TO OTHER I. T. PROJECTS IN OTHER DEPARTMENTS AND WHAT I'D LIKE TO UNDERSTAND IS. IT'S CLEAR THAT- THIS WHOLE SYSTEM IS INCREDIBLY DECENTRALIZED MANY DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE MAKING INDIVIDUAL DECISIONS. WHERE SITE AND IT APPEARS TO ME THAT YOUR AGENCY- IS NOT PARTICULARLY EMPOWERED- TO BE PROACTIVE IN ADDRESSING THESE ISSUES OR OR IF ANYTHING- THE DEPARTMENTS CAN DO WHAT THEY WANT AND THEN YOU GUYS ARE BROUGHT IN ALMOST LIKE AN EMERGENCY ROOM DOCTOR. TRYING TO FIX- THE HORRIFIC MASS AFTER A CAR CRASH AND I JUST WANTED TO UNDERSTAND FROM YOU FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE. HOW WAS YOUR DEPARTMENT INVOLVED IN DECISION MAKING ON IT PROJECTS WHEN YOU LOOKED AND- I SEE FROM THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS WE HAVE. AT LEAST THREE MAJOR- READ RATED STATUS PROJECTS- AT CORRECTIONS FOR THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS AT. DH CS FOR FIFTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS OF THE CHILD WELFARE SERVICES FOR FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS THAT ARE IN CODE RED. AT THIS POINT AND WHAT I WONDER IS YOU KNOW WE'RE ALWAYS CLEAN WE SEEM TO BE CLEAN UP THE MESS AFTER THE FACT. IN PART BECAUSE I'M CONCERNED YOUR DEPARTMENT ISN'T SITUATED TO AGAIN BE PROACTIVE AND TRY TO CENTRALIZE THE JUST NOT AS SOMEONE IF YOU COULD COMMENT ON. YES I'M HAPPY TO AND THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER TO FOR THAT THE QUESTION AND I DO YOU KNOW I AGREE WITH YOU ABOUT THE OVER ALL I. T. TRACK RECORD IN THE STATE IS NOT SOMETHING THAT- YOU KNOW FRANKLY I MYSELF FOR PRODUCTS. BUT ONE THING THAT I WANT TO CLARIFY SPECIFIC ABOUT THE ROLE OF. CALIFORNIA ON THE TECHNOLOGY. IS NOT JUST LIKE YOU DESCRIBE WE ARE IN MANY TIMES ARE- OPERATING ONE YOUR DOCTOR. IT IS BECAUSE THE FACT THAT ON THE DAY TO DAY BASIS. EACH OF THE DEPARTMENTS AND THEY'RE HUNDRED THIRTY PLUS STATE ENTITIES EACH ONE OF THEM HAVE THEIR OWN I. T. SHOP IN EACH ONE OF THEM HAVE THEIR- I. T. BUDGET AND- MAKES OWN- I. T. PROJECT INVESTMENT DECISIONS. WITH THE EXCEPTION THE NES THAT ARE OVER A CERTAIN THRESHOLD WHICH IS WHAT YOU SEE IN THE OVERALL IT PROJECT TRACKING LIST. THAT WENT IN ONLY WHEN DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY- SIDES OVER OVERSIGHT. RESPONSIBILITY. HAVING THAT. I THINK THE- DESCRIPTION ON THIS TECHNOLOGY. IT'S A VERY BALLOT ONE. AND WE KNOW IT'S- THE STATE NH. DECENTRALIZED MODEL IN MANY CASES. IT MIGHT BE- YOU KNOW WARRANTED THE SOME POINT NOT THINKING HEY THE DEPARTMENT HAVE A LOT OF FREEDOM TO DO CERTAIN THINGS. BUT ACTUALLY WHEN IT COMES TO SOLVING THE PROBLEM. IN MORE THAN ONCE ESPECIALLY DEPARTMENT OF SIMILAR PROBLEMS. FOR CATCHING PROBLEM YOU KNOW IN IN A PROACTIVE MANNER RATHER THAN WAITING UNTIL SOMETHING BLOWS UP AND WE GET SENT IN AS THE AS THE OUR DOCTOR TO ADDRESS IT. IS NOT A VERY EFFECTIVE MODEL. SO INTO TO ADDRESS STOCK. THE BUDGET ADDRESS THAT WERE ASKING. RIGHT NOW THE- STABILITY. NOT QUITE STRUCTURE AND PRIDE. IT IS IN THE- TO CORRAL OUT OF A- APPROACH AND IN AN ATTEMPT TO SAY HEY LOOK LET'S NOT YOU KNOW CONTINUE TO BE IN THIS REACTIVE MODE YOU WE HAVE MORE VISIBILITY TO IT NOT ONLY- THAT WE CAN BE MORE PROACTIVE TO IT. BUT IF WE CAN ACTUALLY HAVE MORE VISIBILITY TO THE DATABASE EXPENDITURE IN THE DECISION MAKING IT MORE COMPETITIVE WITH THE DEPARTMENT WE CAN BE MORE INTO WHAT I CALL THE PREVENTIVE CARE AS OPPOSED TO EMERGENCY RESPONSE OF CARE INTRO THE HELP OF THE I. T. INVESTMENT AT THE PARTICULAR PROGRAM. AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE VERY MUCH. YOU'RE NOT OPEN TO. AND INVOLVEMENT IN THE LEGISLATURE AS YOU SEE BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE THE OVERSIGHT ROLE YOU KNOW OVER EXECUTIVE BRANCH AS WELL AND I KNOW THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS ON THE TOP OF MIND FOR YOU ALL AND WE'RE VERY MUCH LOOKING FORWARD WITH YOU WANT TO FIND THE BEST WAY TO CORRECT THIS CULTURE OF REACTION. TO PREVENTION. AND I DON'T WANNA MAKE CLEAR PARTICULARLY TO OUR COLLEAGUES ON THIS COMMITTEE- WHO HAVE HEARD. OVER THE YEARS RAIL AGAINST DIFFERENT AGENCIES THAT HAVE MISMANAGING I THINK MISS HANDLE DIFFERENT I. T. BUDGETS. FROM MY PERSPECTIVE- I ABSOLUTELY SUPPORT YOUR BUDGET REQUEST I ACTUALLY THINK. THE STATE WOULD BE BETTER SERVED IF WE DID A BETTER JOB OF CENTRALIZING- DIED DIED. THE THOUGHT PROCESS THE STRATEGY BUDGET OVERSIGHT WITHIN YOUR DEPARTMENT OR AT LEAST GAVE YOU MORE THIRTY BECAUSE WHAT IT SEEMS TO ME AS- AGAIN YOU GUYS OF THE AFTERTHOUGHT YOU'RE BROUGHT IN. WHEN SOMETHING HAS BLOWN UP. AND WE NEED TO GET YOUR EXPERTISE AND EARLIER- I WAS REALLY STRUCK IN THE VISION TWENTY TWENTY THREE REPORT I'LL JUST READ THIS. WHERE YOU FOUND SEVEN NINE CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS ACROSS TWENTY TWO DEPARTMENTS FORTY FIVE REPORTING SYSTEMS ACROSS FIFTEEN DEPARTMENTS. TWENTY SEVEN LICENSING SYSTEMS ACROSS TWENTY THREE DEPARTMENTS TWENTY THREE CLAIMS MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS ACROSS SEVEN DEPARTMENTS TWENTY CONTENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS ACROSS TEN DEPARTMENTS. THIS IS. THIS IS. ALMOST A STEREOTYPE OF WHAT BARACK CHRISSY GONE WILD. AND FROM MY PERSPECTIVE IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE I REALLY. AYE MAYBE MAYBE THE ONE FOR ONE OF ONE OF THE FEW LEGISLATORS THAT IS REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THIS VISION TWENTY TWENTY THREE REPORT I THOUGHT IT WAS. I THOUGHT YOU RAISES THE RIGHT QUESTIONS AND ISSUES. THAT WE HAVE SEEN OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND THIS COMMITTEE AND I'VE SAID THIS BEFORE BUT FOR ME. EVERY TIME WE GET YET ANOTHER MASSIVE I. T. PROJECT THAT IS YEARS BEHIND AND TENS IF NOT HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. OVER BUDGET- WE'RE SEEING THESE ISSUES HAPPEN OVER AND OVER AGAIN. AND AND THIS HAS TO STOP IT'S BEEN GROUND HOG DAY SO I JUST I GUESS I WANT TO ASK YOU. WHY IS IT THAT DEPARTMENTS DON'T SEEM TO BE LEARNING FROM EACH OTHER'S MISTAKES OR WHAT CAN WE DO BETTER TO SHARE BEST PRACTICES. WHAT COULD YOU BE DOING WORK WE CAN UPLIFT THE LEADERSHIP OF THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY TO. PLAY THIS ROLE. AND SO ON BAD- ASSEMBLY MEMBER SHE WOULD THINK ONE OF THE THINGS AND THANK YOU FOR ACTUALLY READING THE VISION TWENTY TWENTY THREE AND YOU CAN. OR WEBER- I'M- VERY OPEN AND HONEST ABOUT THE CHALLENGES WE'RE FACING. AND I THINK THAT'S ACTUALLY STEP NUMBER ONE. M. FOR LONGER THE DEPARTMENTS YOU KNOW HUNDRED THIRTY PLUS DEPARTMENT AND THIS IS NOT A KNOCKING ANYBODY I THINK IT'S JUST WHEN YOU WORK IN THE- PUBLIC SECTOR. EVERYBODY'S TRYING THEIR DARNDEST AND BEST TO TRYING TO MAKE THINGS WORK. BUT WHEN THINGS ARE NOT GOING WELL INSTEAD OF KIND OF SAY LOOK LET'S JUST GET FOLKS INVOLVED LET'S LEARN FROM OTHER AND LEARN FROM THE EXPERIENCE. I DO THINK SOMETIMES OUR PEOPLE ARE. AFRAID OF FAILURE AFRAID OF- THINGS ARE GOING WELL THEREFORE THEY'RE TRYING TO ACTUALLY FIX IT THEMSELVES. AND THAT IS ANOTHER THING THAT WE WERE TRYING TO. YOU KNOW OF WHAT THE WALKER SO AFRAID WE HAVE NOT BEEN DOING EVERYTHING CORRECTLY. NOTHING IS PERFECT BUT WE'RE NOT AFRAID TO SHARE THAT KNOWLEDGE AS A WAY OF MODELING THE WAY FOR THE OTHER DEPARTMENT TO SAY LOOK. YOU CAN ASK FOR HELP YOU CAN ACTUALLY SHARE THE CHALLENGE THAT YOU HAVE. AN M. AND THEREFORE YOU KNOW. THAT IN SOME PLACES THE CROWDSOURCING MORE ADDITION TO HELP FOR YOU TO OVERCOME THE CHALLENGE WHICH IS ALSO ANOTHER THEME AS YOU CAN SEE THAT IN OUR VISION TWENTY TWENTY THREE. WE'VE LAID OUT THE CHALLENGE THERE AND WOOD BUT WE ARE NOT LIMITING PEOPLE THAT CAN OVERCOME THIS CHALLENGE. BY ONLY YOU KNOW THE DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY FOR CALLING HELP ANYBODY WANTED TO COME ADDRESS DON'T. WORK TOGETHER IS PART OF THE CHALLENGING TEAM. AS A WAY OF SETTING UP THE CULTURE TO SAY. BE TRANSPARENT WHAT YOU DO SUNSHINE THE CHALLENGES THAT YOU'RE FACING SO WE CAN WORK WITH YOU IN A PROACTIVE MANNER. AND THAT'S THE MEASURE WE'RE TRYING TO- CONTINUE TO PUSH FORWARD WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION. OF VISION TWENTY TWENTY THREE. I THINK FROM THIS CAR. ON HER. A MEETING WITH AND YOUR TEAM TO TALK THIS MORE BUT I DO HAVE MAYBE ONE MORE. SO IN THE TWENTY REPORT- IT STATES QUOTE PEOPLE MUST SEARCH FOR PUBLIC INFORMATION AND SERVICES ACROSS. OVER THREE HUNDRED WEBSITES. MANAGED BY MORE THAN A HUNDRED AND FIFTY DEPARTMENTS. USERS FACE INCONSISTENT AND DISCONNECTED EXPERIENCES. ON CALIFORNIA. STATE WEBSITES NOPE CLEARLY. THIS IS A PROBLEM THIS IS AN INCREDIBLY INEFFICIENT FOR THE- SENATE OUR STATE. WE'RE SEEING THIS RIGHT NOW WITH THE BREAKDOWNS RIGHT EDT. MY QUESTION TO YOU IS THERE AS ARE THEIR STATUTORY REASONS THAT DEPARTMENTS AREN'T INTEGRATING ONLINE SERVICES. LIKE ID VERIFICATION INCOME VERIFICATION IS THERE MORE. THAT WE CAN DO TO PUSH BECAUSE THEY WERE UP TO ME. IF I COULD GET- YOU KNOW MAJORITY OF OUR COLLEAGUES IN THE ASSEMBLY IN THE LEGISLATURE. AND AND THE GOVERNOR TO SIGN. IT SEEMS THAT WE GOTTA MOVE TOWARD A MORE INTEGRATED CENTRALIZED APPROACH BUT RIGHT NOW. THIS DECENTRALIZED APPROACH IS CAUSING ENORMOUS WREAKING ENORMOUS HAVOC ON THE DAY TO DAY LIVES OF OUR CITIZENS. I'M I HAVE JUST TO FREE JUMP IN A WELL I THINK YOU THE NAIL. YOU KNOW. YOUR OWN ON FACT THAT. WE MIGHT HAVE POLICY AUTHORITY WE MIGHT EVEN SAY HEY LET'S DO IT TOGETHER. BUT I THINK RIGHT NOW I DO NOT KNOW WHETHER THERE'S% ENOUGH LEFT SECRETARY FOR THE OR I CALL THE CHEAT. BEHIND THAT IN ORDER TO NOT. COURAGE BUT TO- RIGHT NOT THE WHAT MANDATE BUT REALLY REALLY ENFORCED THE ABILITY TO COME USE THE STANDARD PLATFORM SO NOT EVERYBODY INVESTING INTO THE SAME SOLUTION MULTIPLE TIMES. OR YOU KNOW IN THE IN A DIFFERENT WAY OF DOING THAT- JUST I DON'T KNOW IF WE WANT TO CHIME IN ON. THAT PARTICULAR. THANK YOU FOR CALLING- I WOULD RAN FOR THE POINT. AT I. YOU KNOW THIS IS VERY MUCH A AREA WHERE WE CAN EXPLORE POTENTIAL ADDITIONAL STATUTORY LEVERS- BUT IT'S ALSO A BIG CULTURAL SHIFT ASSEMBLY MEMBER. WHERE YOU KNOW DEPARTMENTS ARE USED TO RUNNING THEIR OWN DEPARTMENTAL WEBSITE. WHICH HAS THE DIRECTOR AND THE ORGANIZATION OF THE DEPARTMENT FRONT AND CENTER. AND RUNNING THEIR OWN I. T. SHOPS AND SO PART OF WHAT THE CULTURAL CHANGE WOULD BE IF YOU. WANTED TO ORIENTED AROUND A CALIFORNIA RESIDENT IS HE- YOU KNOW WHAT MATTERS A LOT LESS IS HOW THE DEPARTMENT STRUCTURED WHAT MATTERS A LOT MORE OF THE SERVICES NEED INFORMATION ARE PROVIDED TO THE PUBLIC. AND SORTS THAT CULTURAL SHIFT AND BE SORT OF. AND BOTH THE INSIGHTS AND CAPABILITIES AROUND HELPING DEPARTMENTS MAKE THAT SHIFT THAT ARE GOING TO BE PART OF THE PROCESS. IN ADDITION TO THE QUESTIONS AROUND DUPLICATION OF HOSTING- THAT AB ALLUDED TO EARLIER. RIGHT WELL WELL I PER THAT AND- YOU KNOW I. FULL DISCLOSURE I HAVE BEEN LOOKING OUT FOR POTENTIAL STATUTORY IS TO MOVE THIS. WEEK AS- MONTH AFTER MONTH OF YET ANOTHER I. T. SYSTEM GONE AWRY AND THE IMPACT DURING THIS PANDEMIC IN THIS RECESSION IS JUST LAID BARE FOR US JUST HOW INADEQUATE OUR SYSTEMS ARE. AND WE'VE GOT REFORM SO- SO I'LL JUST SAY TO THE PUBLIC IF THEIR IDEAS PLEASE APPROACH ME I WANT TO CERTAINLY SET UP SOME TIME TO DISCUSS FURTHER- I DO HAVE ONE FINAL QUESTION TO THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S. OFFICE TO THE L. A. IF IT'S OKAY TO GO TO LA YOU KNOW- IN THEIR REPORT IN YOUR REPORT- ELLIE- YOU STATE THAT WE SUGGEST THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER WHETHER STATUTORY CHANGES ARE WARRANTED TO ESTABLISH GOALS. FOR NEW PROGRAMS ARE PRIORITIZE CERTAIN ENTITIES FOR SUSTENANCE I'M WONDERING IF YOU COULD SHED SOME LIGHT ON WHAT YOU THINK. COULD BE HELPFUL HERE BECAUSE L. A. L. YOU ALSO HAVE BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR. HELPING US UNDERSTAND JUST HOW MANY HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IF NOT BILLIONS OF DOLLARS HAVE BEEN WASTED BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO FIGURE THIS OUT. MONEY THAT COULD HAVE GONE DIRECTLY TO CONSTITUENTS COULD HAVE BEEN ADDRESSING THE NEEDS OF OUR CONSTITUENTS BUT INSTEAD- SEEM TO BE GET BOG BOG DOWN IN IN JUST THE MORASCA IT PROJECT FAILURES SO TO THE. ELIO WONDER IF YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT. ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHIU BRIAN MINSKER L. A. L. WE MADE THOSE COMMENTS IN RESPONSE TO THE PROPOSED PROGRAMS THAT WERE PART OF THAT STABILIZE CRITICAL SERVICES AND IT INFRASTRUCTURE PROPOSAL- AND SO WE ARE NOT MENTIONING ANY SPECIFIC STATUTORY CHANGE. OF HEART OF OUR RECORDS. YOU WISH TO HAVE AN ONGOING CONVERSATION WITH YOU AND- OTHER MEMBERS ABOUT- CDC'S EFFORTS- CERTAINLY RECOGNIZING THAT THESE NEW PROGRAMS- WOULD BE. IMPLEMENTED PROVIDING URALS POTENTIALLY. FOR CDT. AND SO TO THE EXTENT PUBLIC WITH ADDRESS IN SO SOMETHING AROUND THESE NEW PROGRAM. OR IDENTIFYING SAY A PARTICULAR ENTITY SUCH AS EDTA FOR THE YOU KNOW FIRST- ASSESSMENT THAT THESE PROGRAMS WOULD PROVIDE WE'D CERTAINLY BE INTERESTED IN HELPING YOU WITH THAT. AMEN MAYBE LET ME JUST CLOSE BY SAYING THAT. QUOTING A GREAT CHIEF CONSULTANT THE ASSEMBLY BUDGET COMMITTEE CHRISTIAN GRIFFITH YOU KNOW GETS COMMENT ABOUT HOW- WE ASSUME THE PUBLIC ARE UPPER MIDDLE CLASS WHITE PEOPLE WITH COLLEGE DEGREES I OFTEN THINK. THAT THE DISCUSSION AROUND TECHNOLOGY THERE'S A LOT OF ACRONYMS THERE ARE A LOT OF KIND OF THINGS TURN AROUND THERE A LOT OF BUREAUCRATS YOU HAVE GRADUATE DEGREES THAT ARE ARGUING THE STUFF BUT FUNDAMENTALLY. OUR IT SYSTEMS ARE BROKEN. AND IT IS NOT BECAUSE OF THE FAULT OF THE OF THE PHARMACOLOGY FROM MY PERSPECTIVE. IT IS BECAUSE TOO MANY DEPARTMENTS ARE IN OVER THEIR HEADS TRYING TO MOVE FORWARD. WITH PROJECTS THAT THEY HAVE NO BUSINESS TRYING TO OPERATE AND WE'VE SEEN THAT TIME AFTER TIME IN THIS COMMITTEE. AND I HAVE TO MEET SIX YEARS AND DURING THIS PANDEMIC DURING THIS RECESSION I'M JUST HARD. SO I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO ENGAGE N THIS CONVERSATION I'M HOPING THAT WE CAN FIGURE OUT HOW TO TURN THIS AROUND AND AGAIN OPEN TO. IDEAS FROM DAILY- FROM DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY FROM INDIVIDUAL AGENCIES. WHO WHO HAVE- WHO HAVE BORNE THE BRUNT OF OUR FEEDBACK OVER THE YEARS BECAUSE- AGAIN. DOLLARS ARE AT STAKE AND BEING ABLE TO SERVE OUR CONSTITUENTS IS WHAT IS AT STAKE AS WELL WITH THAT THANK YOU- MANAGER BACK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER TO I THINK FUND. WHAT YOU REYES ARE ALSO ISSUES OF EQUITY. ARE GIVEN TO THE PANDEMIC WE NEED NOW. HAVE SHED LIGHT ON TO SOMETHING THAT MANY OF US ALREADY KNEW AND THAT. BROADBAND ACCESS TO THE INTERNET IS NOT SO EASILY AVAILABLE ACROSS THE STATE ESPECIALLY IN COMMUNITIES THAT ARE MOST DISENFRANCHISED THAT BEING URBAN OR RURAL COMMUNITIES THAT. SIMPLY JUST DON'T HAVE ACCESS AND WORKING WITH- TECHNOLOGY AND WEBSITES THAT ARE ANTIQUATED AND DON'T OFFER A GOOD. USER EXPERIENCE IS A PROBLEM- ONE OF THE MAIN ONES THAT WE'VE SEEN SO FAR IS- EDT IN TERMS OF. HOW DOES ONE GET ACCESS TO A SMARTPHONE TO TAKE A PHOTO TO VALIDATE YOURSELF AND IDENTIFY WHO YOU ARE. WHEN MOST LOW INCOME WORKERS- ACTUALLY USE FLIP PHONES THAT YOU GET FROM A CONVENIENCE STORE. AND DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO PAY THE ONE HUNDRED DOLLAR PLUS FOR A SMARTPHONE. WELL WE'RE ASKING THEM TO VERIFY AND IDENTIFY THEMSELVES SO THAT THEY GET ACCESS TO THE BENEFITS THAT THEY SO RIGHTFULLY DESERVE. IT IS AN ISSUE OF TECHNOLOGY THAT WE ARE IN A ANOTHER GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO TRY TO SOLVE. THANK YOU FOR THAT. SCENE NO ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM. THE COMMITTEE WE WILL MOVE ON TO THE NEXT- ISSUE AREA WE ARE AN ISSUE. A NUMBER FIFTEEN. OUT OF SEVENTEEN SO WE'RE ALMOST THROUGH. THE OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH BUDGET BUDGET PROPOSALS. IN THIS PANEL WE HAVE. KATE GORDAN WITH THE OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH SCOTT MORGAN SAME OFFICE. BRIAN WHETHER FORD WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND EMMA AND JOHN WORTH WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. LET'S BEGIN. THANK YOU SO MUCH CHAIR CARILLO I HOPE YOU CAN HEAR ME I AM CAIT GORDON ON THE DIRECTOR OF THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF PLANNING RESEARCH STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL. AND CALIFORNIA VOLUNTEERS UNDER ITS ADMINISTRATIVE UNIT AND- JUST A LITTLE BACKGROUND ON OPR BECAUSE SOMETIMES I THINK IT IT'S GOOD THAT REMINDER TO FOLKS ESPECIALLY THE PUBLIC OF WHAT WE DO. OKAY OUR SERVICE TO PROVIDE INPUT AND GUIDANCE TO THE GOVERNOR CABINET LEGISLATURE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT A LONG RANGE PLANNING AND POLICY ISSUES WE SERVE. AS A COORDINATOR FACILITATOR OF ISSUES THAT ARE CROSS CUTTING IN NATURE AND DON'T FIT NATURALLY INTO AN EXISTING AGENCY BUT INVOLVE COLLABORATION AND ENGAGEMENT ACROSS AGENCIES. FOUR FOUR MAJOR AREAS OF FOCUS AND I SHOULD SAY- I ENCOURAGE MEMBERS AND THE PUBLIC TO LOOK AT OUR WEBSITE WHICH WE JUST REDESIGNED IN HOUSE. UNDER THE KIND OF CORE PRINCIPLES THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY JUST LIKE AROUND ACCESS AND READABILITY SPECIFICALLY SO I'M REALLY. PROUD OF THAT AND FOR AREAS WHERE WE FOCUSED OUR- LAND USE AND PLANNING. CLIMATE RISK AND RESILIENCE INCLUDING EMERGENCY RESPONSE TO RECOVERY. HIGHROAD ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT FOR SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND LONG RANGE RESEARCH INITIATIVE THIS INCLUDES A VOTE VARIETY OF CATHOLIC CROSS GENERAL PLANETS PEOPLE GUIDANCE TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. THE INTEGRATED CLIMATE ADAPTATION RESEARCH PROGRAM THE REGION'S AUTHORIZED TOGETHER AND JUST TRANSITION. PROGRAMS PRECISION MEDICINE THE MILITARY COUNCIL AND ALL OF THE DIRECT PROGRAMS PROVIDED THROUGH DISTRICT YOU BROKE COUNCIL AND CALVET YEARS. WE PERFORM THESE FOUR BIG FUNCTIONS A VERY SMALL STAFF OF JUST NINETY SEVEN POSITIONS OVERSEEING AND ADMINISTERING OVER FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN STATE FUNDS PRIMARILY GOING OUT THE DOOR IN GRANTS OR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE DIRECTLY TO COMMUNITY. OUR BUDGET REQUEST FOCUS ON ADDING CAPACITY TO MANAGE OUR ADMINISTRATIVE AND COMMUNICATIONS REQUIREMENTS ACROSS ALL THREE UNITS. AS WELL AS THE BUILD MINIMAL CAPACITY TO MEET OUR STATUTORY RESPONSIBILITIES TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE ACROSS. GOVERNMENT AS WELL AS TO REGIONAL LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SAID THOSE SPECIFICALLY ARE. ONE POINT ONE MILLION AND SEVEN POSITIONS TO ADDRESS INCREASED WORKLOAD AND STRENGTHEN ADMINISTRATIVE OPERATIONS ACROSS ALL THREE OF OUR UNITS OF PR FOR VEHICLE COUNCIL CALDERON TEARS IN RECOGNITION. OF INCREASE STATUTORY GRANTING CONTRACTING ACTIVITIES. FIVE HUNDRED EIGHT THOUSAND THREE POSITIONS TO CONTINUE THE REGIONAL CLIMATE COLLABORATIVE PROGRAM CREATED AT THE STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL THROUGH SB TEN SEVENTY TWO WHICH PROVIDED ONLY TWO YEARS INITIALLY OF SUPPORT FOR THAT PROGRAM. REALIGNMENT OF ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS IN BE AT AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES PROGRAM THROUGH STC TO REFLECT THE REALITY. OF THE COMPLEXITY AND THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE NEEDS THAT OF WRITING NOT PROGRAM AND I JUST WANTED TO KNOW THAT THE PROGRAM CURRENTLY RUNS WITH LESS THAN ZERO POINT 4% ADMINISTRATIVE OVERHEAD SO THIS WOULD BE A REALIGNMENT TO ALLOW FOR MORE ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT FOR THE PROGRAM. FOUR HUNDRED SIX THOUSAND TO IMPLEMENT A JUST TRANSITION ROADMAP AS REQUIRED BY EXECUTIVE ORDER AND SEVENTY NINE TWENTY BUT ALSO. BY THE STATE'S OVERALL FOCUS ON THE TRANSITION TO A CARBON NEUTRAL ECONOMY BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE. HUNDRED SEVENTY THREE THOUSAND AND DOLLARS AND ONE POSITION EMPLOYMENT AB TWENTY TWO THIRTEEN FOCUSED ON PLANNING GUIDANCE AND VOLUNTEER COORDINATION FOR CALVET HERE'S THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS DURING DISASTERS AND FINALLY. ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION AND NINE STAFF POSITIONS THE CALIFON TEARS TO MAINTAIN THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE FRAMEWORK THAT WAS PUT IN PLACE DURING COMBAT. WE ALSO I SHOULD SAY HAVE A SMALL PIECE OF THE OVERALL WILDFIRE BUDGET BUT THAT'S NOT BEING ADDRESSED HERE TODAY I KNOW THAT'S BEING ADDRESSED IN ANOTHER HEARING SO. THOSE ARE MADE PROPOSALS SCOTT MORGAN MY CHIEF DEPUTY AND I ARE HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THAT LET'S HEAR FROM MR WHETHER FORD AND- IN STRONG WORTH WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. YES BRENT WHETHER FORD WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- REGARDING THE ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF AUGMENTATION RECIPIENT. THANKS FOR STOPPING WE NEED THESE POSITIONS ARE REASONABLE IN LIGHT OF THE SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN THE- ON THE STATUTORY RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH. STEP COMMITTED THE OBJECT AND IT DID HIGHLIGHT THE INCREASED SIZEAND SCOPE OF THE OFFICE OF PLANNING RESEARCH AND- BUT WE DON'T HAVE ANY SPECIFIC CONCERNS ABOUT. THIS TIME WILL BE HAPPY TO HELP YOU CONSIDER THESE ISSUES. THANK WORK DEPARTMENT AND WE HAVE NO ADDITIONAL CONCERNS- AT THIS TIME YEAH. THANK YOU TO THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE HAVE ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. OKAY I DO HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS FOR YOU MISS GORDON THE AGENDA RAISES CONCERNS ABOUT THE GROWTH OF THIS OFFICE CAN YOU COMMENT ON THAT. SURE ABSOLUTELY SO MOST OF THE GROWTH IN THE OFFICE OF PLANNING RESEARCH IN TERMS OF OUR BUDGET WHICH AGAIN IS PRIMARILY GOING OUT THE DOOR ACTUALLY IN IN DIRECT GRANTS AND SUPPORTED IN TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE MOST OF THAT GROWTH COMES THROUGH THE STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL. THE STRATEGIC pORIGINALLY PART OF THE OFFICE OF PLANNING RESEARCH IT WAS ORIGINALLY PART OF THE RESOURCES AGENCY ALTHOUGH IT WAS CO LOCATED WITH THE OFFICE OF PLANNING RESEARCH. THE I. OD STATUTORY DIRECTION OF ODD FUNDING THROUGH THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND TO THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES PROGRAM THE TRANSFORMATIVE CLIMATE COMMUNITIES PROGRAM AND THEN NOW THE REGIONAL CLIMATE COLLABORATIVE'S PROGRAM. AS WELL AS THE CLIMATE RESEARCH PROGRAM ALL RUN THROUGH AS YOU SEE AT THE FINANCIALLY I DIRECTED AT A SIGNIFICANT OUT OF FUNDS TO BE RUN THROUGH OUR OFFICE AND THROUGH S. YOU SEE SINCE THAT TIME. ALL OF THESE PROGRAMS ARE REALLY HIGH. I THINK RELEVANT TO OPR SEVERAL FOCUS BECAUSE THEY ARE CROSS CUTTING THEIR PROGRAMS THAT BRING TOGETHER ARE THE STATE'S HOUSING TRANSPORTATION CLIMATE AND EQUITY GOALS. UNDER ONE ROOF I WITH THE GOAL TOWARD OR AN IDEA TOWARD A MORE SUSTAINABLE AND RESILIENT AND INCLUSIVE GROWTH PATTERN FOR DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS UP ON THE GROUND HOUSING PROJECTS THAT SHOW EXACTLY HOW THAT MONEY IS SPENT AND WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE TO DO A REALLY IS. THE STATE ABOUT RESILIENCE YOU KNOW AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECT FOR INSTANCE GOING FORWARD SO WE THINK THEY'RE VERY PERFORATED OPR AND AGAIN THE MAJORITY OF THAT FUNDING IS GOING DIRECTLY OUT THE DOOR WITH VERY VERY LIMITED STAFF PROVIDING. VERY EFFICIENT SERVICES TO GET IT OUT. THANK YOU FOR THAT- UPLIFT. RESTORED IN. I GUESS MY CONCERN REALLY IS IF YOU WERE TO IF YOU LOOK AT THE GROWTH OF OPR IT. REALLY COINCIDES WITH OTHER LARGE DEPARTMENTS LIKE THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY THAT DEPARTMENT CONSUMER AFFAIRS. AND THE DEPARTMENT OF TOXIN SUBSTANCE CONTROL THE TSC. WHICH- HAS ACTUALLY NOT BEEN GREAT IN DEALING WITH IT A HUGE ISSUE IN MY DISTRICT AND OTHER MEMBERS DISTRICT- KNOWN AS EXCITED WHICH I BELIEVE IS THE LARGEST ENVIRONMENTAL DISASTER ACROSS. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT NO ONE KNOWS ABOUT. AND SO I AM I'M JUST CONCERNED IN TERMS OF. THE GROWTH OF A DEPARTMENT AND COMPARE INSTANT IN COMPARISON TO OTHER DEPARTMENTS THAT. DON'T NECESSARILY- REPORTS OR ACT OR CONVEY TRUST IN THEIR ABILITY TO FUNCTION. AND SO I'M I'M CURIOUS WHAT YOU THINK OF THAT IN TERMS OF IF YOU WERE TO COMPARE DEPARTMENTS AT THAT SCALE- FUNCTIONALITY OF IT. ABSOLUTELY I THINK IT'S- IT'S THAT IMPORTANT POINT I DO WANT TO POINT OUT IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF APPLES AND ORANGES COMPARISON FROM A BUDGET STANDPOINT. OPR AGAIN PRIMARILY INCLUDES PATH THROUGH GRANTS INCLUDING THAT FOR A HOUSING SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES PROGRAM WHICH IS BY FAR OUR BIGGEST PROGRAM THROUGH THE STREETS TRIPITAKA COUNCIL IF YOU LOOK AT OVERALL BUDGETS DTS YOU TOTAL BUDGET IS SIX HUNDRED FIFTEEN MILLION CD T. IS FOR NINETY TWO AND A PR CIS FIVE TWENTY ONE BUT- MOST OF THOSE DOLLARS ARE GREAT DOLLARS SO FROM A STAFF PERSPECTIVE. ETFC HAS NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTY TWO POSITIONS ST EIGHTY EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO WHAT OKAY ARE JUST NINETY SEVEN VERSIONS ON THE BOOKS SO. WE REALLY FEEL THAT WE ARE PROVIDING EXTREMELY EFFICIENT SERVICES ON FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN STATE FUNDS AT A FRACTION OF THE COST THAT OTHER EIGHT THAT OTHER DEPARTMENTS DO. THAT ARE AT WORK STREATLEY EFFICIENT WERE EXTREMELY LEAN- AND WE PRIDE OURSELVES ON BEING YOU KNOW THEY ARE TO PROVIDE A VIGOROUSLY IN PORT AN ESSENTIAL FUNCTION PARTICULARLY. AS THE FIFTH FACING INCREASING THE ACTORS AND OUR LACK OF RESILIENCE IN THE FACE OF THE EARTH AFTER HIS BECOMING CLEARER. WE REALLY FINANCED THROUGH- HIGHLIGHT THE LONG TERM POLICY PLANNING ISSUES THAT THE STATE IS FACING TO LOOK AT BUILDING OUT A MORE RESILIENT SYSTEM A MORE SUSTAINABLE SYSTEM AT DOING THAT AGAIN IS EFFICIENTLY AS POSSIBLE SO I THINK. WE WHEN YOU REALLY LOOK AT THE KIND OF DIG INTO THE NUMBERS ON THOSE DEPARTMENTS CHAIR I THINK. YOU REALLY SEE THAT WE ARE- WE'RE PRETTY LEE. I APPRECIATE THAT YOU THAT IN OF MISS I THAT'S AS A ABOUT YOUR RESEARCH IN TERMS OF THE- REPRESENTATION OF THE DEPARTMENT I APPRECIATE THAT HAS THE ADMINISTRATION CONSIDERED MOVING SOME OF THE OFFICE FUNCTIONS TO A DEPARTMENT. OUTSIDE OF THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. OVER TIME IT YES FIRST. CERTAIN THINGS IT'S INTERESTING YOU KNOW WE AT OPR AND I'LL LET SCOTT BECAUSE THIS IS WELL IF YOU'VE BEEN THERE FOR MUCH LONGER THAN I HAVE BUT AT OPR. WE ACTUALLY PRIDE OURSELVES ON ON. HELPING THE LEGISLATURE ANOTHER AGENCIES AND THE GOVERNOR- THINGS WHERE APPROPRIATE WE'VE SPENT A FAIR AMOUNT OF THIS BUDGET SEASON FOR INSTEAD. OF FOCUSING ON THE BUDGETS OF OTHER AGENCIES THAT WE THINK ARE MORE WELL SUITED TO SOME FUNCTIONS THAN WE ARE WE HAVE SUPPORTED GO BANS ON BUILDING UP POSITIONS IN THIS BUDGET WE SUPPORTED THE I. BANK IN THE CLUB A CATALYST FUND. WE'VE BEEN- YEAH I WOULD GET A YEAR LONG COLLABORATION WITH THEIR RESOURCES AGENCY TO REALLY IDENTIFY WHAT PIECES OF CLIMATE RESILIENCE MAKES SENSE EVERY FORCES VERSUS- PR. SO I LIKE TO THINK THAT WE'RE VERY INTENTIONAL. ABOUT WHAT WE CAN DO WHAT WE SHOULD DO AND WHERE OPR SCORE VALUE WITH WHICH IS REALLY THAT COORDINATION FUNCTION. BEING ABLE TO LOOK AT LONGTIME RETIREMENT BEING ABLE TO SUPPORT YOU NO LONGER TERM KIND OF FUNCTIONS AT OTHER AGENCIES BUT ALL OUTSIDE SCOTT IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD TO THAT. FROM A HISTORICAL CONTEXT. YEAH I WOULD AGREE WITH THOSE COMMENTS KATE'S CALIFORNIA WITH A P. R. THE MANY TIMES WILL WE END UP DOING IS PARTNERING WITH OTHER ENTITIES EARLY ON IN PROJECTS. AND THEN. HAVING THEM OVER TAKE KIND OF THE DAY TO DAY OPERATIONS ON THINGS SO. IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE ONLINE LEARNING LAB WE PARTNERED WITH- THE FOUNDATION OF COUNT CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO HELP US IMPLEMENT THAT. THE CRADLE TO CAREER PROGRAM IS SIMILAR TO THAT WHERE WE'VE WE'VE- PARTNERED WITH CSU. AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE MORE. EXPERTS IN THAT FIELD SO. YOU KNOW WE END UP KIND OF FINDING THE SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS AND WORKING WITH THEM AND HAVING THEM. HELP US IMPLEMENT A LOT OF THOSE PRETTY PROGRAM SO. YOU KNOW WE DO YOU KNOW OFFLOAD PROJECTS. AS WE CANDID TO THE EXPERTS THAT ARE IN THOSE FIELDS AS MUCH AS WE CAN. GOT IT THANK YOU MISTER MORGAN. I DON'T HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS I DON'T BELIEVE THAT- WE HAVE ANY FROM THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS AS WELL THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TAKING THE TIME APPRECIATED FOR GONNA MOVE ONTO. HERE ARE. I'M SORRY. OKAY THANK YOU- WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO OUR ISSUED NUMBER SIXTEEN GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS AGENCY ROLE IN CRISIS. A VERY TIMELY WE'RE GOING TO GO WITH OUR PANELISTS JUSTIN HOWARD WITH GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS AGENCY CHEST ALAMO WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE EVELYN SEUSS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND RYAN WEINBERG WITH APARNA FINANCES WELL LET'S BEGIN MISTER HOWARD. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR CAN YOU HEAR ME OK YES WE CAN HEAR YOU OKAY GREAT THANK YOU AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TODAY. TO DISCUSS THAT ARE AGENCIES GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS AGENCY OUR ROLE IN THE CRISIS I THINK THE AGENDA LAYS OUT VERY WELL BACKGROUND HISTORY BUT I'LL GO THROUGH. PIECES OF IT AGAIN I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT OUR AGENCY WERE ALLEGEDLY NEW AGENCY WE WERE ESTABLISHED BACK IN JULY OF 2013% TO THE GOVERNMENT REORGANIZATION PLAN NUMBER TWO- WE WERE CREATED IN ORDER TO HELP SIMPLIFY YOUR STRENGTH AND IMPROVE THE OPERATION MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS. THAT PROTECT AND PROVIDE SERVICES TO STATE AGENCIES UNEMPLOYED. WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ADMINISTERING A VARIETY OF FUNCTIONS THAT EXIST IN THE GENERAL OPERATIONAL STATE GOVERNMENT SUCH AS CHAIRMAN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY HUMAN RESOURCES. OUR GOAL ULTIMATELY IS TO HELP FOSTER STATEWIDE PERSPECTIVES IMPROVE COMMUNICATION AND INFORMATION SHARING THE CHANGE DEPARTMENT POP CULTURES THAT PRIORITIZE CONTROL OVER SERVICE WE ARE COMPRISED OF- TEN DIFFERENT. STATE ENTITIES IN TWO SEPARATE STANDALONE OFFICE IS THAT ALL REPORTER AGENCY ONE OF THE SMALLER AGENCIES THE STATE GOVERNMENT BUT ULTIMATELY WE ARE TASKED WITH SIGNIFICANT POLICIES THAT WE HAVE TO IMPLEMENT ALL OF WHICH TYPICALLY HAVE CROSS CUTTING- IMPLICATIONS. FOR ALL STATE DEPARTMENTS. I'M WITHIN THE PAST YEARS BOB HAS UP FOR GRAND OFFICES WHAT BY SIXTY TWO MILLION BEFORE. TO NEW DEPARTMENTS ALL OVER- VARIOUS- THE- VARIOUS THINGS WILL LABOR RELATIONS CHAIRMAN CHU AND TO AND- FURTHERMORE COLLAPSES BROUGHT INTO ASSESS OTHER STATE. THROUGH OPERATIONAL CHALLENGES THAT EXISTS ON SOME OF THOSE EXAMPLES AS NOTED IN THE AGENDA WHAT THE DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES ANALYSTS STRIKE TEAM. A LITTLE OVER A YEAR AGO AS WELL AS READ MOST RECENTLY EVP. STRAIGHT TEAM THIS PAST FALL. BOB THIS IS A VERY UNIQUE ROLE WITHIN STATE GOVERNMENT AND SO FAR AS WE ARE ABLE TO CUT THROUGH SOME OF THE FOR LACK OF A BETTER WORD RED TAPE THAT EXISTS BECAUSE WE OVERSEE THREE OF THE- FOUR MAJOR CONTROL DEPARTMENTS WITHIN THE STATE. THOSE BEING THE DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY WHO YOU HAD ON REGION EARLIER THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES AS WELL AS SPEAK. AND DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN RESOURCES. WILD DEVOPS- IS ALWAYS WILLING TO HELP WHEN ASKED FOR ASSISTANCE. FROM OUR FELLOW DEPARTMENTS OUT THERE ONE OF OUR GOALS THAT WE'RE HOPING TO DO AND SOME OF THE PROPOSALS AND THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ARE AIMED AT THIS ARE TO BE MORE PROACTIVE IN TERMS. IN TERMS OF HELPING TO IDENTIFY IDENTIFY ISSUES AND ADVANCE OF THEM BECOMING A CRISIS- SO THAT WAY WE ARE ALWAYS BEING REACTIVE AND BEHIND THE BALL SOME OF THOSE AND SOME OF THOSE EXAMPLES INCLUDE THAT RESOURCE IS BEING REQUESTED BY CDTV WAS PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED AS WELL FOR ADDITIONAL RESOURCES. THE REQUESTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN RESOURCES THAT ARE. GOING TO HELP US BE MORE PROACTIVE HEALTH DEPARTMENTS IN ADVANCE SO THAT THEY DON'T FALL INTO THE- THE CRISIS THAT WE HAVE SEEN. WITH EDT- AND DMB. AND WHAT I'M TO- AND ANY QUESTIONS OF THE MEMBERS HAVE ABOUT OUR WALNUT SOME TALKING HERE ABOUT- OUR RECENT- BEING PASSED TO HELP WITH THE VACCINE RELATED EFFORTS- I'LL JUST NOTE THAT- PART OF THE- THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING RELATED TO VACCINES AND THE- RELATION AND ESTABLISHMENT OF THE TGA IS STILL. UNDER WAY- IT HAS NOT BEEN FINALIZED AND- TIONS. AGREEMENT IS STILL. ONGOING SO IRAQI INTELLIGENCE TOO MUCH ABOUT THAT BUT I CAN SHARE WHAT- I CAME IN TERMS. ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES RELATED TO CHRIST. THANK YOU FOR THAT MISTER HOWARD LET'S HEAR FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AS WELL AS THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE. THANK YOU- CHAD ALAMO WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE ON A FEW COMMENTS IT SPECIFICALLY IN REGARD TO- THAT GOV OPS IS ROLE WITH THE EDT STRIKE TEAM REPORT ON. WHAT WE ARE CONSISTENT WITH SOME OF THE COMMENTS IN THE STAFF AGENDA REGARDING SORT OF SETTING ACCOUNTABILITY AND EXPECTATIONS FOR OF OPS- WE THINK THAT'S A AN ONGOING CONVERSATION THE LEGISLATURE TO HAVE GIVEN THIS SORT OF NEW ROLE. THAT WERE SAYING THE AGENCY PLAY AND CRISIS MANAGEMENT FOR STATE OPERATIONS ON. THE STRIKE TEAM REPORT- WAS UNDERTAKEN AND HEADED BY THE GOVERNOR OFFICE AGENCY AND WHEN THAT REPORT WAS RELEASED IN SEPTEMBER THIS SUBCOMMITTEE HEARD- FROM REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE AGENCY AS AS WELL AS OUR OFFICE AND- IN REVIEWING THE STRIKING REPORT ITSELF IT WAS INCREDIBLY THOROUGH IT WAS CRITICAL OF EDIE'S LONGSTANDING OPERATIONS- AND- CULTURAL- PERSPECTIVES RELATED TO FRAUD PREVENTION. AND IT WAS RELATIVELY CONSISTENT WITH HOW OUR OFFICE HAD VIEWED THE CHALLENGES THAT EDT BUT ONE OF THE ISSUES WE RECOMMENDED AT THE TIME THIS WAS IN OCTOBER. WAS THAT THE LEGISLATURE ENCOURAGED GOV OFFICE TO MAINTAIN. AN OVERSIGHT ROLE OF EDIE'S PROGRESS IN IMPLEMENTING THE RECOMMENDED CHANGES IN THE STRIKE TEAM REPORT. AND GIVEN ITS NEW ROLE THERE THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE A LEGISLATIVE MECHANISM FOR ENSURING THIS KIND OF OVERSIGHT- AND SO I RAISE THAT BECAUSE OF THE UNIQUE NATURE OF DEVOPS IS ROLE IN THE REDISTRICTING REPORT ONGOING CONVERSATION. BETWEEN THE LEGISLATURE AND THE ADMINISTRATION ABOUT HOW THE AGENCY WELL. ESTABLISH ACCOUNTABILITY ROLES AND EXPECTATIONS WHEN IT IS INVOLVED IN AN SERVE STEPPING IN WITH DEPARTMENTS TO WORK IN A CRISIS SITUATION LIKE THIS THANK YOU I'M HAPPY THAT STAY ON THE PANEL FOR QUESTIONS- BUT. AGAIN JUST. BOB RESERVING MY COMMENTS TO ET DE SPECIFIC THANK. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. RIGHT ONE OF THE FINANCE FINANCES. OR ANYTHING GIVEN MISSION FOR OUR OFFICE FIVE. BUT THANK ARE THERE ANY COMMON FROM COMMITTEE. ROGER YES MISTER CHIP FIVE MAY I LET ME FIRST START I WANT TO JUST COMPLEMENT GOV OPS FOR YOUR ROLE IN DEALING WITH SOME OF THE MOST INTENSE CRISIS WE'VE HAD RECENTLY PARTICULAR AROUND DMV AND EDT- ANDREALLY- YOU KNOW AS WAS ALLUDED TO THE DISTRACTING REPORT THAT TO US SECRETARY RICHARDSON WAS WAS A PART OF AND YOUR TEAM IS A PART OF REALLY DID I THINK PROVIDE AT LEAST AN INITIAL ROAD PATH FOR MOVING US OUT OF THE EDT MORASS BUT I HAVE TO ASK THE QUESTION TO GO BOPS REITERATING WHAT ELIO HAS JUST ASKED. BUT THE NUMBER OCCASIONS. HOW IS IT THAT THE DMV STRIKE TEAM CONTINUES ON FOR THE BETTER PART OF THE YEAR AND REALLY. SHEPHERDS MUCH NEEDED REFORMS THERE WHEN IN THE CONTEXT OF EDT. GIVEN HOW INTENSE THIS CRISIS IS HOW MANY MILLIONS OF PEOPLE IT'S IMPACTING HOW MANY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. WE'VE SEEN. DISAPPEAR TO FRAUD. THE IDEA THAT. WE WERE. ONLY HAD A FORTY FIVE DAY STRIKE TEAM. ENGAGEMENT AND AT THIS TIME WITH AN AGENCY THAT'S ONLY IMPLEMENTED HALF OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS WHILE THE BACKLOG HAS GOTTEN WORSE. WHILE MAJOR FRAUD CONCERNS OF MATERIALIZE I'VE GOT TO ASK WHY IS GOV OX NOT ENGAGING AND ANOTHER ROUND OF. THE STRIKE TEAM EFFORT- TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS GETS DONE BECAUSE FROM MY PERSPECTIVE. EDT NEEDS ALL THE HELP THEY CAN GET AND IT SEEMS THAT. IN THE FORTY FIVE PLUS DAYS THAT. YOUR AGENCY WAS INVOLVED. YOU HELPED A BIT AND- YOU KNOW I THINK. REGAUGED INCOME. ASSIST AT THIS TIME. THE QUESTION. NUMBER TWO- I GUESS I'LL JUST OFF BY SAYING USUALLY WHEN WE'RE CALLED INFORMING GAUGE AND WE DO TRY TO WORK ON DEFINING WHAT THE SCOPE OF THAT ENGAGEMENT IS PRIOR TO US GETTING INVOLVED- AS IT RELATES TO SPECIFICALLY EDT I DON'T WANT TO HAVE THE MISCONCEPTION THAT WE'RE NOT DOING ANYTHING- THE OFFICE THE DIGITAL INNOVATION CONTINUES TO BE INVOLVED TO SOME EXTENT BEHIND THE SCENES IN TERMS OF PROVIDING TECHNICAL ADVICE AND GUIDANCE AS IT RELATES TO OUR RECOMMENDATIONS- SO WE PRETEND WE CONTINUE TO PROVIDE SOME LEVEL. OF GUIDANCE ON THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE PUT OUT THERE AS DOES AS IT IS CDTV HOWEVER THE ULTIMATE RESPONSIBILITY FOR OVERSEEING AND IMPLEMENTING- AND BEING RESPONSIBLE FOR OVERSEEING WHETHER OR NOT ET EMPLOYMENT.

WELL IN THE IN SCOPE RESPONSIBILITY AT GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS AGENCY IS WE STILL WE STILL HAVE OUR AGENCY FROM WHICH WE HAVE TO RUN AND OPERATE AND MANAGE THE DEPARTMENTS THAT REPORT TO US.

TIME I'LL TRY TO BE BRIEF FINAL THINGS ARE RUNNING OLD RATHER LONG BUT WE DO HAVE TO BUDGET PROPOSALS FOR YOU TODAY THE FIRST ONE IS RELATED TO THE STATEWIDE DATA STRATEGIES ARE AGENCY IS REQUESTING THREE POSITIONS AND FIVE HUNDRED FIFTEEN THOUSAND GENERAL FUND IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. I'M TO FACILITATE AND SUPPORT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A STATEWIDE DATA STRATEGY CONDUCT EVALUATIONS- FOR GOV OP CENTER OF GOVERNMENT EXCELLENCE AND COMMITTEE ON COMMUNITY IN THE STATEWIDE DATA STRATEGY WILL HELP LAY THE GROUNDWORK FOR STATE DEPARTMENTS TO DELIVER BETTER OUTCOMES TO THE RESIDENTS THEY SERVE BY BREAKING DOWN DATA BARRIERS. ANNOUNCEMENTS AND GOVERNMENT PRACTICES INCREASE DEPARTMENTS ABILITY TO USE DATA ANALYTICS ALL OF WHICH SHOULD LEAD TO BETTER DECISION MAKING AND RESOURCE ALLOCATIONS BY SERVICE PROVIDERS AND POLICY MAKERS IN THE FUTURE WITH ME TODAY ON THIS PROPOSAL IS JOY RUNNING AROUND THE STATE THIS IS THE STATE'S CHIEF DATA OFFICER AND SHE CAN HELP ANSWERANY PROGRAMMATIC QUESTIONS RELATED TO THE STATEWIDE DATA STRATEGY. THE PROPOSAL FRONT OF YOU- IS A WORKLOAD PROPOSAL AND SPECIFICALLY WE ARE ASKING FOR FOUR POSITIONS AND ONE MILLION ELEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY SIX THOUSAND ONGOING AND AN ASSOCIATE TRAILER BILL ALONG WITH. LANGUAGE TO FIND AND MANAGE. NEW AND EXISTING WORKLOAD RELATED TO STATE GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS WHILE ALSO ADDRESSING SOCIAL ECONOMIC AND RACIAL DISPARITIES WITHIN THESE OPERATIONS. I APPROVING THIS REQUEST WILL OUT OF THE BOX TO APPROPRIATELY PROVIDE STATEWIDE POLICY DEVELOPMENT AND CRITICAL INDEPENDENT OVERSIGHT OF THE ENTITIES THAT REPORT TO BELMONT AND ESTABLISH A STATE WIDE EQUITY INCLUSION FRAMEWORK FOR HIRING PROCUREMENT AT THE STATE DEPARTMENT MUST FOLLOW WITH ME TODAY AS I WANNA TRY TO CHOOSE A SPECIAL CONSULTANT FOR THE GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS AGENCIES SPECIALIZING AND RACIAL EQUITY AND INCLUSION EFFORTS. AND SHE'S AVAILABLE TO IT'S VERY PROBLEMATIC QUESTIONS RELATED TO OUR EQUITY COLLUSION EFFORTS WITHIN OUR AGENCY SO WITH THAT WE. ARE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU LET'S GO WITH THE- LET'S ANALYST'S PLEASE. FOLLOWED BY THE DEPARTMENT FIND. THANK YOU CHAD ALAMO WITH THE L. A. L. OUR OFFICE IS CURRENTLY REVIEWING BOTH THE PURPLE AND THAT NO ISSUES AT THIS TIME BUT WILL REACH OUT TO COMMITTEE STAFF IF ANYTHING ARISES. THANK YOU MR ALAMO DEPARTMENT FINANCE. RIGHT WE HAVE SOME GOOD AS WELL. OKAY THANK YOU I ACTUALLY DO HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS I BELIEVE THE CICERO FROM MISTER HOWARD OR FOR- MISS TROUT HOW CAN WE ENSURE THAT HIRING A CHIEF EXECUTIVE CHIEF EQUITY OFFICER LEADS TO MAKE MEANINGFUL IMPROVEMENTS IN INCREASING ACCESS AND OPPORTUNITY TO COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN LEFT BEHIND. I CAN TAKE THAT TESTING- GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM LIR- ADDRESS YOUR QUESTION. I AM A SPECIAL CONSULTANTS BEEN BROUGHT IN OVER SIX MONTHS AGO TO LOOK AT THIS ISSUE. AND I WILL SAY THAT. THIS **** IS SO CRITICAL FOR THE TIME THAT. SOMEONE NEEDS EQUITY RACIAL EQUITY AND INCLUSION ISSUES ARE IT IT NEEDS OWNERSHIP AND THAT WAS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE NOTICED WAS PROMISING FROM THE STRUCTURE THE CURRENT STRUCTURE THAT'S IN PLACE WHERE MULTIPLE COLLABORATIONS AND WORKS GOING ON TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE BUT IT'S IN FIVE MODE IN DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS AND- WE THOUGHT THAT THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A CHIEF BUT THE POSITION OF THE CHIEF EQUITY OFFICER. ALLOW SOMEONE TO TAKE OWNERSHIP AND THEN AS YOU HEARD IN THE PREVIOUS- TESTIMONY WHERE THE GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS AGENCY HAS A VERY CONSULTANT TYPE ROLE SO HAVING AN EXPERT IN THIS FIELD JUST ADDS TO THAT KIND OF THAT WHOLE HOLISTIC TYPE OF CONSULTING THAT THE AGENCY CAN OFFER AND HELP IT RAMP UP AND- PUTTING TOGETHER ALL THE RESOURCES THAT. ARE IN DIFFERENT AGENCIES SO WE COULD HELP DEFINE WHAT THIS FRAMEWORK LOOKS LIKE. THANK YOU FOR THAT MYSTERY I THINK THIS IS PERHAPS THE FIRST TIME THAT I HEAR SOMEONE SPEAK ABOUT RACIAL EQUITY ANDINCLUSION- IN A IN A BUDGET HEARING I BELIEVE I'VE I'VE BROUGHT IT UP A COUPLE OF TIMES AND I APPRECIATE IT. IT JUST SEEMS TO ME. I TAKE THAT THOSE POSITIONS VERY SERIOUSLY. AND IT SEEMS ONE INDIVIDUAL CHARGED. WITH OVERSEEING AN ENTIRE GOVERNMENTAL STRUCTURE- IS REALLY. IT CAN LOOK LIKE IT'S JUST A FIGURE PERSON AND NOT SOMEONE THAT'S ACTUALLY GOING TO BE DEDICATED TO DIVING INTO THE INEQUITIES ACROSS THE VARIOUS DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES ACROSS THE STATE- HOW HOW WILL THAT ACTUALLY IMPROVE OUR EQUITY ISSUES. I WILL SAY AND I HATE TO BE CLICHE ABOUT THAT IS THE JOURNEY OF A THOUSAND MILES BEGINS WITH ONE SINGLE STAFF- ONE OF THE THINGS CRITICAL THINGS I. ARE MY OBSERVATION HAVING COME IN THERE TO LOOK AT THE STRUCTURE WAS THOUGH. WE DIDN'T SEEM TO BE SOMEONE WHO OWNED IT AN INDIVIDUAL WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR. EXECUTING MANAGING CONDUCTING MASSAGING BAY KIDDING. WHAT THIS FRAMEWORK LOOKS LIKE AND SO I KNOW IT'S ONE BUT THAT WE ARE IN TALKS WITH- THE ADMINISTRATION TO LOOK AT REALLY AND TRULY HOW DO WE ADDRESS THIS IN A HOLISTIC WAY. AND I MAY NOT BE HERE BECAUSE THEY SET UP A SPECIAL CONSULTANT BUT HOW DO WE CONTINUE TO WORK AND MAKE SURE THAT IT IT IT IT HAS CONTINUITY. IT STAYS IT OUTLASTS BECAUSE THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME THAT THIS HAS BEEN ADDRESSED BY AN ADMINISTRATION. SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WHATEVER WE PUT INTO PLACE STAYS AND- OUTLASTS WHOEVER IS RUNNING THE ADMINISTRATION SO THAT'S THE PURPOSE OF A YOU KNOW LIKE I SAID ONE.YOU KNOW TAKES ONE PERSON. SOMETIMES FOUGHT BALL GO. IF I COULD ADD TO THAT- JUST SAVE THAT ONE THING HAS I PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED IN THE OTHER ITEMS OR THAT LEVERAGING- RESOURCES ACROSS THE STATE SO MANY DEPARTMENTS HAVE VARIOUS- THINGS GOING ON IN THIS AREA AND WE PLAN TO LEVERAGE RESOURCES WHETHER IT BE AT EXPERTISE OR EXISTING PROGRAMS WHERE POSSIBLE. BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY IS AGAIN BECAUSE WE OVERSEE ASK THREE OF THE MAJOR CONTROL AGENCIES THIS PERSON WILL BE ABLE TO HAVE A BIG IMPACT IN THAT SCENE WHERE THE GAPS ARE AS IT RELATES TO RACIAL EQUITY INCLUSION WITHIN THE STATES AND TO THE EXTENT THAT WE IDENTIFY NEED. FOR ADDITIONAL RESOURCES IN THE FUTURE WILL OBVIOUSLY GO THROUGH THE APPROPRIATE PROCESS AND WHAT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IF THAT DOES COME TO FRUITION THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF A PARALLEL TO THE STATE WIDE DATA STRATEGY AND SO FAR AS- WE FIRST BROUGHT ON THE STATE'S CHIEF DATA OFFICER ABOUT THAT INDIVIDUAL CHOI WHO'S ON THE LINE SPENT HER FIRST YEAR KIND OF DOING A REVIEW OF THE ENTIRE LANDSCAPE OF DATA. WITHIN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND IDENTIFYING YOU KNOW WHAT WAS MISSING WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE IN ORDER TO MAKE THAT A MORE CENTRAL PARK. GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS AND SO THIS PERSON WILL LIKELY HAD A SIMILAR ROLE AND MATT AND MESHEL. MICHELLE WORK NEEDS TO BE DONE. THANK YOU FOR THE MISTER I A- IT THE TO. OF THE PROCESS SEEMS TO FOLK ON. AND HIRING BY THE STATUS ANY INTO TO ALL LOOK AT HOW STATE ITSELF COMMUNICATES WITH DIVERSE COMMUNITIES. YES THERE THERE WE THE JOB DESCRIPTION OF THIS POSITION IS OUR WORKING PROCESS THAT WE WERE COLLABORATING WITH MULTI AGENCIES OF COURSE CALAIS TIMER AND- COMMUNICATE INFORMATION ACCESS AND TRUST. THOSE ARE THE THREE LANES OF WHICH WERE LOOKING AS WE- WE ROLLED OUT WHAT IS OF WHAT IS IMPORTANT. FOR THIS POSITION WITHIN THE STATE. SO A WORK IN PROGRESS POSITION FOR A CHIEF EQUITY OF EQUITY OFFICER- UNFORTUNATELY TO ME DOESN'T SOUND LIKE IT'S A FULLY VETTED POSSESSION WITH INTENT TO ACTUALLY DO THE WORK NECESSARY AROUND EQUITY- MISTRUST YOU BEEN BROUGHT IN FOR THE LAST SIX MONTHS. I APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING WITH THE STATE AND SHEDDING SOME LIGHT ON THIS HIGHLY IMPORTANT ISSUE- CLEARLY THE PANDEMIC HAS SHOWN US THAT THERE IS- A CLEAR LACK OF EQUITY IN TERMS OF- RESOURCES AND OPPORTUNITIES AS WELL AS OUR A CUP OUR RECOVERY EFFOTS AROUND COVE IT I WANT TO BRING UP. THE INFORMATION THAT MISTER HOWARD SURE IN TERMS OF DATA IN A PREVIOUS HEARING THAT WE HELD- THE CONVERSATIONS AROUND DATA AND EQUITY ARE MARRIED SO WHEN I ASK CAN YOU PROVIDE US INFORMATION OF HOW MANY WHAT'S THE PERCENTAGE OF SMALL BUSINESSES THAT HAVE RECEIVED- OUR SMALL BUSINESS GRANTS THAT ARE BOTH WOMEN AND MINORITY. THE DATA WAS NOT AVAILABLE. AND SO THAT IS AN EQUITY ISSUE HOW ABOUT LANGUAGE CULTURAL BARRIERS- AND SO I'M I'M CURIOUS AS TO HOW ONE INDIVIDUAL ONE PERSON. IS GOING TO BE CHARGED WITH ENSURING THAT DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES AND PROCEDURES. OF FOLLOWING ISSUE OF EQUITY. OR DO THEIR WORK THROUGH THE LENS OF EQUITY. HELLO AND THIS IS JUST THE END OF JULY I DON'T I THINK YOU'RE YOU'RE ON BUT- I'LL TAKE A STAB MAYBE FILL IN SOME GAPS. IN DATA IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT AND ESPECIALLY WHEN IT RELATES TO. EQUITY ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB AT THE STATE IS ENSURING THAT THE DATA THAT WE'RE COLLECTING IS THE APPROPRIATE DATA SO THAT WE CAN PROPERLY EVALUATE HOW PROGRAMS ARE WORKING WHETHER EQUITIES PEOPLE FELT SO. IN RELATION TO- THE POSITION OR BEING ASKED FOR THEY WILL DEFINITELY BE WORKING CLOSELY GIVEN THAT THE WILL BE HOUSED IN THE SAME AGENCY WITH- THE STATE'S CHIEF DATA OFFICER AS WELL AS THE POSITIONS THAT WE ARE SEEKING EMPLOYMENT THE STATEWIDE DATA STRATEGY SO THAT DEPARTMENTS ARE ACTUALLY. COLLECTING THE CORRECT TYPE OF DATA IN MINUTES AND WE CAN THAT'S CAN BE USEFUL FOR ALL DEPARTMENTS AND THE LEGISLATURE ADMINISTRATION SO THAT WHEN THEY'RE TRYING TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT THE- EFFECTIVENESS OF PROGRAMS. THEY CAN CLEARLY SEE THAT. JOY IS THERE ANYTHING YOU'D LIKE TO ASK. DATA IMPORTER EQUITY. NOW I'LL I'LL JUST TELL THAT- I- BY. IN JUST BEIN THE SAME AGENCY WITH THE CHIEF EQUITY OFFICER WE'VE I FULLY EXPECT WORK CLOSELY AND I'M ALREADY WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH A LINE OUT AROUND- SEVERAL ISSUES AROUND EQUITY AS FAR AS WELL AS THE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE ON CALIFORNIA. LEADS TASK FORCES AROUND EQUITY ISSUES AND DATA COMPONENTS THERE. THANK YOU AND I TRULY DO APPRECIATE THE EFFORTS I THINK- THE FRUSTRATION THAT I FEEL AS WELL AS I KNOW IN CONVERSATIONS THAT HAVE THAT I HAVE HAD WITH MY COLLEAGUES. ARE JUST RELATING ON ON. THERE'S THE EXPEDIENCY AND HOW THINGS ARE MOVING VERY QUICKLY GIVEN. CODE RECOVERY EFFORTS. OF BOTH FOR VACCINES TESTING- REOPENING SAFELY OUR ECONOMY AND ENSURING THAT ESSENTIAL IN FROM MY WORKERS ARE PRIORITIZED ESPECIALLY. OUR MOST VULNERABLE- IN TERMS OF ACCESS TO THE INTERNET TO EVEN MAKE AN APPOINTMENT ONLINE OR ANY LANGUAGE BARRIERS AND SO I FEEL LIKE WE ARE BEHIND IN MANY WAYS ON THE CONVERSATION ON EQUITY AND DECISIONS THAT ARE BEING MADE THAT AT THE END OF THE DAY CAN EITHER- HELP OR HARM. OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY AND SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE AWARE IN TERMS OF THE CONVERSATIONS THAT ARE TAKING PLACE AND THE NECESSITY OF INCLUSION. EQUITY RACIAL RACIAL EQUITY INCLUSION AND CONVERSATIONS THAT ARE NECESSARY AND I THINK WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT HOW DO WE FIND A POSITION THAT THE POSITION IS NOT JUST SOLELY A POSITION TO SAY THAT WE HAVE ONE. BUT THAT IT IS IT IS ACTUALLY A PERSON WITH INFLUENCE POWER AND ABILITY TO MOVE THINGS IN THE WAY THE DIRECTION THAT THE STATE NEEDS SOME TO BE MOVED ON. YES THANK YOU FIVE FOR THAT FEEDBACK AND- I THINK WE ARE IN. COMPLETE AGREEMENT ON THAT AND- WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE CONVERSATION FURTHER CONVERSATIONS ON THE SUBJECT. TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN.
