00:27:37.055 --> 00:27:38.823

AN AGING CALIFORNIA THAT

00:27:46.931 --> 00:27:49.768
EMPOWERS ALL CALIFORNIANS TO AGE

00:27:49.834 --> 00:27:53.204
WITH DIGNITY CHOICE AND

00:27:53.271 --> 00:27:54.706
INDEPENDENCE.

00:27:54.773 --> 00:27:56.007
NOT THAT IT'S ANYTHING I'M

00:27:56.074 --> 00:27:57.008
PERSONALLY.

00:27:57.075 --> 00:27:59.210
IN NEED OF RIGHT AT THE MOMENT

00:27:59.277 --> 00:28:00.378
BUT WE DO KNOW THAT THE STATE OF

00:28:00.445 --> 00:28:02.747
CALIFORNIA IS AN AGING STATE.

00:28:02.814 --> 00:28:03.948
THAT WE ARE GOING TO HAVE FOUR

00:28:04.015 --> 00:28:06.084
MILLION MORE SENIORS IN OUR

00:28:06.151 --> 00:28:07.919
STATE BY TWENTY THIRTY AND WE

00:28:07.986 --> 00:28:09.521
ARE ABSOLUTELY TOTALLY

00:28:09.587 --> 00:28:11.289
UNPREPARED.

00:28:11.356 --> 00:28:12.190
SO.

00:28:12.257 --> 00:28:14.559
THE PUBLIC POLICY INSTITUTE OF

00:28:14.626 --> 00:28:15.960
CALIFORNIA AS I MENTIONED.

00:28:16.027 --> 00:28:17.796
ESTIMATED THIS NUMBER OF FOUR

00:28:17.862 --> 00:28:20.098
MILLION ADDITIONAL SENIORS.

00:28:20.165 --> 00:28:22.801
OVER THE AGE OF SIXTY FIVE BY.

00:28:22.867 --> 00:28:24.069
TWENTY THIRTY ANY IMPLICATIONS

00:28:24.135 --> 00:28:26.271
AFFECT NOT ONLY OLDER ADULTS AND

00:28:26.337 --> 00:28:27.672
PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES BUT

00:28:27.739 --> 00:28:29.140
ALSO THEIR FAMILIES.

00:28:29.207 --> 00:28:30.742
LOCAL COMMUNITIES AS WELL SO

00:28:30.809 --> 00:28:33.545
STATE. 20% OF CALIFORNIA'S OLDER

00:28:33.611 --> 00:28:35.513
ADULTS LIVE IN POVERTY AS WE

00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:36.681
SPEAK.

00:28:36.748 --> 00:28:38.416
AND THIS NUMBER IS EXPECTED TO

00:28:38.483 --> 00:28:39.884
INCREASE WITH THE AGING OF OUR

00:28:39.951 --> 00:28:43.455
STATE. 90% OF OLDER ADULTS WOULD

00:28:43.521 --> 00:28:45.056
LIKE TO AGE IN THEIR HOMES AND I

00:28:45.123 --> 00:28:46.724
DON'T THINK THAT'S A SHOCKING

00:28:46.791 --> 00:28:48.526
NUMBER I SUSPECT IT'S AT LEAST

00:28:48.593 --> 00:28:49.427
90%.

00:28:49.494 --> 00:28:50.695
THAT'S WHERE WE'RE COMFORTABLE

00:28:50.762 --> 00:28:52.163
THAT'S WERE WERE FAMILIAR THAT'S

00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:53.765
WHAT WE KNOW THAT'S WHERE WE'VE

00:28:53.832 --> 00:28:55.533
LIVED OUR NEIGHBORS OURFRIENDS

00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:57.135
OUR COMMUNITIES ARE ALL RIGHT

00:28:57.202 --> 00:28:57.969
THERE.

00:28:58.036 --> 00:29:00.305
BUT OFTEN LACK OF ACCESS TO THE

00:29:00.371 --> 00:29:01.773
NECESSARY SERVICES.

00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:05.844
AND SUPPORT MAKE IT DIFFICULT IF

00:29:05.910 --> 00:29:07.579
NOT POSSIBLE TO DO THAT.

00:29:07.645 --> 00:29:08.379
WE'RE ALSO FACING UP.

00:29:08.446 --> 00:29:10.648
THIS CREATES A CRISIS OF REALLY

00:29:10.715 --> 00:29:11.816
IT.

00:29:11.883 --> 00:29:13.451
ENORMOUS PROPORTIONS WERE

00:29:13.518 --> 00:29:14.886
ALREADY IN NEGATIVE BIRTH RATE

00:29:14.953 --> 00:29:16.888
STATE AND AS THE STATE AGES WE

00:29:16.955 --> 00:29:19.090
NEED MORE SERVICES AND SUPPORTS

00:29:19.157 --> 00:29:20.458
FOR OLDER ADULTS.

00:29:20.525 --> 00:29:22.193
BUT THE REALITY IS THE COST OF

00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:23.895
LONG TERM CARE SERVICES AND

00:29:23.962 --> 00:29:26.131
SUPPORTS IS ON AFFORDABLE FOR

00:29:26.197 --> 00:29:28.366
MOST CALIFORNIANS AND FRANKLY AS

00:29:28.433 --> 00:29:30.368
WE TIGHTEN UP THE REQUIREMENTS

00:29:30.435 --> 00:29:32.103
FOR IN HOME HEALTH SERVICES.

00:29:32.170 --> 00:29:34.706
AS WE SHOULD THE COST TO ACCESS

00:29:34.772 --> 00:29:37.242
THIS KIND OF HERE CARE BECOMES

00:29:37.308 --> 00:29:38.877
EVEN MORE EXPENSIVE.

00:29:38.943 --> 00:29:41.279
SO WE KNOW THE ANNUAL COST OF

00:29:41.346 --> 00:29:42.614
THIRTY HOURS A WEEK OF HOME CARE.

00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:44.716
IS ALMOST THIRTY SIX THOUSAND

00:29:44.782 --> 00:29:46.117
DOLLARS THREE QUARTERS OF THE

00:29:46.184 --> 00:29:48.553
STATE'S MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME.

00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:49.988
THE MEDIAN ANNUAL COST OF

00:29:50.054 --> 00:29:52.724
NURSING HOME CARE IS A WHOPPING

00:29:52.790 --> 00:29:53.358
HUNDRED TWELVE THOUSAND DOLLARS

00:29:53.424 --> 00:29:55.793
A YEAR WHICH IS MORE THAN TWICE --

00:29:55.860 --> 00:29:57.328
THE STATE'S MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD

00:29:57.395 --> 00:29:59.364
INCOME AND ONLY 5% OF

00:29:59.430 --> 00:30:01.833
CALIFORNIANS AGE FORTY AND OLDER

00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:02.834
HAVE ACTUALLY EVEN PURCHASE

00:30:02.901 --> 00:30:05.937
PRIVATE LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE.

00:30:06.004 --> 00:30:07.472
I IT'S NOT A VERY DESIRABLE

00:30:07.539 --> 00:30:08.573
PRODUCT.

00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:11.042
AND IT'S NOT VERY AFFORDABLE AND

00:30:11.109 --> 00:30:11.809
YET.

00:30:11.876 --> 00:30:14.279
WHEN PEOPLE AGE THERE'S REALLY

00:30:14.345 --> 00:30:16.214
NOTHING THERE TO PROTECT THEM --

00:30:16.281 --> 00:30:17.448
IN THAT.

00:30:17.515 --> 00:30:20.418
IT IN THEIR LIVES SO -- ACROSS

00:30:20.485 --> 00:30:21.853
THE STREET THE STATE OLDER

00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:23.521
ADULTS PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES

00:30:23.588 --> 00:30:25.523
AND FAMILIES RELY ON SERVICES

00:30:25.590 --> 00:30:27.258
PROVIDED THROUGH MULTIPLE STATE

00:30:27.325 --> 00:30:28.593
AGENCIES.

00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:29.928
INCLUDING DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE

00:30:29.994 --> 00:30:32.630
SERVICES SOCIAL SERVICES AGING

00:30:32.697 --> 00:30:34.766
REHABILITATION TRANSPORTATION I

00:30:34.832 --> 00:30:36.434
MEAN IT'S THE GAMBIT EVERYTHING

00:30:36.501 --> 00:30:38.136
YOU CAN THINK OF DOES HAVE AN

00:30:38.203 --> 00:30:39.871
EFFECT AND IS NECESSARY IN

00:30:39.938 --> 00:30:41.606
PARTICULAR GREATER LEVELS.

00:30:41.673 --> 00:30:43.374
AS PEOPLE AGE THEY'RE NOT ABLE

00:30:43.441 --> 00:30:44.943
TO DRIVE THEY SHOULDN'T DRIVE

00:30:45.009 --> 00:30:46.611
THEY HAVE HEALTHCARE ISSUES THEY

00:30:46.678 --> 00:30:48.780
HAVE COGNITIVE ISSUES THEY HAVE

00:30:48.846 --> 00:30:49.981
PHYSICAL IMPAIRMENTS.

00:30:50.048 --> 00:30:51.983
THAT NOT ONLY ARE DISABILITY

00:30:52.050 --> 00:30:54.152
COMMUNITY IN GENERAL BUT ALSO

00:30:54.219 --> 00:30:55.720
MOBILITY ISSUES ALL THE THINGS

00:30:55.787 --> 00:30:57.689
THAT HAPPEN AS WE AGE AND WE ARE

00:30:57.755 --> 00:30:58.623
LIVING LONGER.

00:30:58.690 --> 00:31:00.391
I JUST LOST MY MOTHER IN LAW IN

00:31:00.458 --> 00:31:02.760
DECEMBER AT THE AGE OF ONE

00:31:02.827 --> 00:31:06.097
HUNDRED AND FOUR YEARS OLD -- SO --

00:31:06.164 --> 00:31:07.065
AND THOSE ARE STORIES WE HEAR

00:31:07.131 --> 00:31:08.666
MORE AND MORE PEOPLE LIVING

00:31:08.733 --> 00:31:10.902
LONGER AND LONGER AND WE HAVE

00:31:10.969 --> 00:31:12.403
THE INABILITY TO CARE FOR THEM.

00:31:12.470 --> 00:31:14.572
SO DESPITE THE MANY PROGRAMS AND

00:31:14.639 --> 00:31:16.507
SERVICES ADMINISTERED BY THE

00:31:16.574 --> 00:31:17.909

00:37:30.881 --> 00:37:32.550

YOUNG STATE AND KIDS BUT OUR

00:37:39.624 --> 00:37:40.725
MAIN FOCUS.

COMING FARMING FAMILY FAMILIES.

00:37:51.702 --> 00:37:54.338
ALL THE FIRST UP.

00:37:54.405 --> 00:37:56.540
REALITY THAT THEY CALL AS WAS A

00:37:56.607 --> 00:37:59.677
DEMAND FOR PRIMARY SCHOOLS AND

00:37:59.744 --> 00:38:01.145
SECONDARY SCHOOLS WITHIN THE

PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND THEN

COMMUNITY COLLEGES.

00:38:04.482 --> 00:38:06.150
AND THEN THE FORMATION OF NEW

00:38:06.217 --> 00:38:08.119
SUBURBS IN INFRASTRUCTURE AND

NOW THEY ARE MY AGE THEY ARE

00:38:10.021 --> 00:38:11.956
SEVENTIES.

00:38:12.023 --> 00:38:13.658
AND THEY NEED HELP.

00:38:13.724 --> 00:38:15.626
MANY OF THEM HAVE NOT PREPARED

00:38:15.693 --> 00:38:16.193
PROPERLY.

00:38:16.260 --> 00:38:18.496
AW MANY OF THEM CAN'T PREPARE

00:38:18.562 --> 00:38:21.165
GIVEN THAT THE COST STRUCTURE

00:38:21.232 --> 00:38:22.867
THAT WE FACE.

00:38:22.933 --> 00:38:24.669
AND SO THIS GOVERNOR HAS.

00:38:24.735 --> 00:38:28.572

00:38:30.141 --> 00:38:32.510
A MASTER PLAN ON AGING AND I

00:38:32.576 --> 00:38:34.111
THINK THAT THIS BILL.

00:38:34.178 --> 00:38:36.013
BRINGS THE LEGISLATURE END OF

00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:37.415
THAT PROCESS WHICH IT NEEDS TO

00:38:37.481 --> 00:38:39.050
BE.

00:38:39.116 --> 00:38:40.885
AS AN ADVOCATE LIVES SINCE THE

00:38:40.951 --> 00:38:42.753
BEGINNING OF A DISCUSSION OF A

00:38:42.820 --> 00:38:45.089
MASTER PLAN I FELT VERY STRONGLY

00:38:45.156 --> 00:38:46.824
THAT WE NEED TO COMBINE BOTH THE

00:38:46.891 --> 00:38:48.693
EXECUTIVE BRANCH.

00:38:48.759 --> 00:38:51.062
BUT ALSO LEGISLATIVE OUR CONCERN

00:38:51.128 --> 00:38:54.165
AND INTEREST AND AWARENESS OF OF

00:38:54.231 --> 00:38:55.599
OUR PROBLEMS AND NEEDS.

00:38:55.666 --> 00:38:58.502
AND THIS BILL LAYS OUT WAYS TO

00:38:58.569 --> 00:39:00.404
DO THAT -- THEY'LL BE A LITTLE

00:39:00.471 --> 00:39:02.840
BIT OF FINE TUNING OF WHAT THIS.

00:39:02.907 --> 00:39:04.809
BILL CONTAINS WITH WHAT THE

00:39:04.875 --> 00:39:07.078
GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER

00:39:07.144 --> 00:39:08.679
PROPOSES.

00:39:08.746 --> 00:39:09.180

00:41:51.041 --> 00:41:52.810
SENATOR JACKSON THIS IS A SPOT

00:41:52.877 --> 00:41:55.479
ON BILL GREATLY NEEDED I

00:41:55.546 --> 00:41:57.248
SUPPORTED A 100%.

00:41:57.314 --> 00:42:00.251
BUT I HAVE TO MAKE A CONFESSION.

00:42:00.317 --> 00:42:02.253
I SPENT THIRTY NINE YEARS IN THE

00:42:02.319 --> 00:42:04.622
INSURANCE BUSINESS IN ABOUT

00:42:04.688 --> 00:42:06.824
TWENTY YEARS AGO WHEN INSURANCE

00:42:06.891 --> 00:42:08.826
COMPANIES DEVELOPED LONG TERM

00:42:08.893 --> 00:42:10.160
CARE INSURANCE.

00:42:10.227 --> 00:42:13.898
I JUMPED ON IT -- I COULD NAME

00:42:13.964 --> 00:42:16.100
OFF VARIOUS INSURANCE COMPANIES

00:42:16.166 --> 00:42:17.134
THEY CAME OUT WITH EXCELLENT

00:42:17.201 --> 00:42:19.637
PRODUCTS [inaudible]

00:42:19.703 --> 00:42:21.272
WONDERFUL BENEFITS.

00:42:21.338 --> 00:42:23.908
AND I WOULD HAVE BEEN PAID A TEN

00:42:23.974 --> 00:42:27.378
OR 12% COMMISSION TO SELL IT.

00:42:27.444 --> 00:42:30.581
SO I STARTED OUT LONG TERM CARE

00:42:30.648 --> 00:42:32.082
SALES WITH RICH PEOPLE

00:42:32.149 --> 00:42:32.383
[inaudible]

00:42:32.449 --> 00:42:33.951
GETTING CARE.

00:42:34.018 --> 00:42:35.552
THEN I WENT TO UPPER MIDDLE

00:42:35.619 --> 00:42:36.954
CLASS [inaudible]

00:42:37.021 --> 00:42:38.989
HEARING CARE.

00:42:39.056 --> 00:42:41.025
SAME WAY WITH MIDDLE CLASS NO

00:42:41.091 --> 00:42:42.793
DIDN'T THINK THEY NEEDED IT.

00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:44.595
LOWER MIDDLE CLASS.

00:42:44.662 --> 00:42:47.698
WELL NOW WE HAVE TROUBLE OF

00:42:47.765 --> 00:42:49.133
FORTY NINE AND THEN I EVEN WENT

00:42:49.199 --> 00:42:51.568
DOWN TO JUST REGULAR BLUE COLLAR

00:42:51.635 --> 00:42:54.438
WORKERS THAT I KNEW MAN YOU'RE

00:42:54.505 --> 00:42:56.040
IN TROUBLE IF YOU DON'T.

00:42:56.106 --> 00:42:57.775
BUY THIS STUFF [inaudible]

00:42:57.841 --> 00:43:00.177
NO.

00:43:00.244 --> 00:43:02.579
SO LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE THE

00:43:02.646 --> 00:43:05.082
PERCEPTION OF HUMAN BEINGS IS.

00:43:05.149 --> 00:43:06.984
THEY DON'T NEED IT UNTIL THEY

00:43:07.051 --> 00:43:07.618
NEEDED.

00:43:07.685 --> 00:43:09.019
THEY DON'T WANT TO PAY FOR IT

00:43:09.086 --> 00:43:09.553
AHEAD OF TIME [inaudible]

00:43:09.620 --> 00:43:12.089
SO.

00:43:12.156 --> 00:43:14.058
I SUPPORT THIS BILL FROM A

00:43:14.124 --> 00:43:17.227
FEELING OF I DON'T KNOW HOW I

00:43:17.294 --> 00:43:19.263
COULD PUT IT.

00:43:19.330 --> 00:43:22.066
SOME OF FAILED CAPITALIST AT

00:43:22.132 --> 00:43:23.567
LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE

00:43:23.634 --> 00:43:23.867
[inaudible]

00:43:23.934 --> 00:43:25.235
RIGHT.

00:43:25.302 --> 00:43:27.271
SO GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO STEP IN

00:43:27.338 --> 00:43:28.572
ON THIS.

00:43:28.639 --> 00:43:31.141
ONE AND SENATOR JACKSON IS.

00:43:31.208 --> 00:43:33.010
LEADING THE WAY I DON'T KNOW

00:43:33.077 --> 00:43:34.011
WHAT WILL COME OUT OF THIS

00:43:34.078 --> 00:43:35.145
REPORT.

00:43:35.212 --> 00:43:36.413
BUT I'M GONNA BE LOOKING AT IT

00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:39.883
VERY CLOSELY BECAUSE WE HAVE THE

00:43:39.950 --> 00:43:42.119
SILVER TSUNAMI HITTING THIS I'M

00:43:42.186 --> 00:43:44.355
GOING TO BE SIXTY NINE YEARS OLD.

00:43:44.421 --> 00:43:48.659
AND I DIDN'T BUY LONG TERM CARE

00:43:48.726 --> 00:43:51.195
INSURANCE BECAUSE BY THE TIME I

00:43:51.261 --> 00:43:54.064
PERCEIVED I MIGHT NEED.

00:43:54.131 --> 00:43:56.433
TO IT WAS TOO EXPENSIVE.

00:43:56.500 --> 00:43:59.570
SO I'M JUST AS BAD AS MY CLIENTS.

00:43:59.636 --> 00:44:02.006
SO THAT'S WHY SUPPORT YOUR BILL

00:44:02.072 --> 00:44:05.409
AND I THANK GOD YOU HAVE IT.

00:44:05.476 --> 00:44:09.046
THANK YOU OF THIS RACE.

00:44:09.113 --> 00:44:11.882
I HAD A GOOD INSURANCE GUY I DID

00:44:11.949 --> 00:44:15.152
BUY LONG TERM CARE.

00:44:15.219 --> 00:44:17.955
THE NO NO REFLECTION ON YOU MY

00:44:18.022 --> 00:44:19.523

00:44:19.590 --> 00:44:20.491

I I DO WANT TO THANK YOU SENATOR

00:44:21.825 --> 00:44:22.626
I THINK THAT WHEN WE'RE TALKING

00:44:22.693 --> 00:44:24.595
ABOUT ANY OF THESE IMPORTANT

00:44:24.661 --> 00:44:27.331
ISSUES FOR CALIFORNIA WE HAVE TO

00:44:27.398 --> 00:44:28.732
FIGURE OUT WHAT THE PLAN IS.

00:44:28.799 --> 00:44:30.100
AND IT CAN'T JUST BE MISHMASH

00:44:30.167 --> 00:44:31.535
AND DEAL YOU DO THIS AND YOU DO

00:44:31.602 --> 00:44:33.637
THAT BECAUSE AS YOU'VE INDICATED

00:44:33.704 --> 00:44:35.172

AND DOING WONDERFUL JOBS BUT

00:44:39.576 --> 00:44:41.412
UNTIL WE SAY THIS IS SUCH AN

00:44:41.478 --> 00:44:43.747
IMPORTANT ISSUE WE WANT A MASTER

00:44:43.814 --> 00:44:44.681

SWORN IN.

00:44:53.791 --> 00:44:55.859
BUT WHEN HE TALKED ABOUT THIS --

00:44:55.926 --> 00:44:58.495
I KNEW WAS IMPORTANT BEFORE I

00:44:58.562 --> 00:44:59.863

SO CALIFORNIA HAS TO IMPENDING

00:55:52.182 --> 00:55:53.516
CRISIS ONE IS THE LACK OF

00:55:53.583 --> 00:55:55.051
HOUSING THAT'S AFFORDABLE FOR

00:55:55.118 --> 00:55:57.420

MEDICAL HOME CARE NEEDS OF OUR

00:56:09.466 --> 00:56:10.366
MILLION.

00:56:10.433 --> 00:56:12.402
IT'S ESTIMATED THAT BY TWENTY

00:56:12.469 --> 00:56:13.803
TWENTY THE ANNUAL AN INDIRECT

00:56:13.870 --> 00:56:15.705

00:56:17.607 --> 00:56:19.743
MILLION.

00:56:19.809 --> 00:56:21.077
THE MAJORITY OF THOSE COST WILL

00:56:21.144 --> 00:56:22.579
BE BORNE BY MEDICARE AND MEDI

00:56:22.645 --> 00:56:24.681
CAL.

00:56:24.748 --> 00:56:26.015
GIVEN CALIFORNIA'S NEED TO

00:56:26.082 --> 00:56:27.751

THE STATE TO MAKE THAT HOUSING

00:56:31.321 --> 00:56:35.024
MORE AGING DISABILITY FRIENDLY.

00:56:35.091 --> 00:56:36.392
BY INCORPORATING FALLS

00:56:36.459 --> 00:56:37.894
PREVENTION OR SPECIFIC

00:56:37.961 --> 00:56:40.196

00:56:43.967 --> 00:56:45.335
MAKING THESE CHANGES WILL ALLOW

00:56:45.401 --> 00:56:47.170
RESIDENTS TO STAY IN THEIR HOMES

00:56:47.237 --> 00:56:49.506
AS THEY AGE AND ALLOW FAMILIES

AS THEY NEED ADDITIONAL SUPPORT.

00:56:58.248 --> 00:57:00.016
POLICY FEATURED CAN BE MUCH LESS

00:57:00.083 --> 00:57:01.217
COSTLY WHEN BUILT INTO THE

DEVELOPMENT AND INDIVIDUAL HOMES

00:57:05.622 --> 00:57:06.890
RATHER THAN RETROFITTING

00:57:06.956 --> 00:57:08.758
EXISTING HOMES.

00:57:08.825 --> 00:57:11.127
THE REQUESTED FEATURES IN SB TWO

00:57:11.194 --> 00:57:12.162
EIGHTY WILL NOT SIGNIFICANTLY

00:57:12.228 --> 00:57:14.998
CHANGE THE LOOK OR THE COST OF

00:57:15.064 --> 00:57:16.332
BUILDING THE HOUSE.

00:57:21.704 --> 00:57:23.039
BE ABLE TO SAVE MONEY AS THEY

00:57:23.106 --> 00:57:24.140
