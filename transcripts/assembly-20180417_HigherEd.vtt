00:41:20.744 --> 00:41:23.347 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AS THAT CAL STATE EAST BAY. AND

00:41:23.414 --> 00:41:25.182 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
AND HEAVY CONSIDERATION FOR

AT LEAST ONE OF THEM.

00:41:28.319 --> 00:41:30.221 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
BEING IN AN AREA THAT IS.

EXORBITANTLY HIGH HOUSING AND

00:41:33.057 --> 00:41:33.958 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
I'M SURE SOMEBODY COULD POINT

00:41:34.024 --> 00:41:35.159 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%

CONSIDERATION OR GUIDANCE GIVEN

00:41:47.204 --> 00:41:48.005 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THE EXTENT TO WHICH WE CAN DO

00:41:48.072 --> 00:41:49.573 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%

OPEN IN TERMS OF THE THREE

00:42:32.583 --> 00:42:33.984 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
CAMPUSES MY GUESS IS IT'S GOING

00:42:34.051 --> 00:42:36.020 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
TO BE DIFFICULT. TO DECIDE

00:42:36.086 --> 00:42:37.688 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BECAUSE THEIR CAMPUSES ARE ALL

00:42:37.755 --> 00:42:38.722 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
VERY DIFFERENT AND HAVE

00:42:38.789 --> 00:42:40.524 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
DIFFERENT RESOURCES LOCATED

00:42:40.591 --> 00:42:41.792 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
WITHIN A.

00:42:41.859 --> 00:42:43.861 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE DISTANCE ON THAT FACT THAT

00:42:43.928 --> 00:42:45.696 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SOME ARE BRAND NEW AND HAVE VERY

00:42:45.763 --> 00:42:47.398 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
LITTLE HOUSING IN SUMMER REALLY.

00:42:47.464 --> 00:42:49.366 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
MUCH OLDER BUT HAVE GROWN.

00:42:49.433 --> 00:42:51.669 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
THAT.

00:42:51.735 --> 00:42:53.470 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
CITIES HAVE GROWN UP AROUND THE

00:42:53.537 --> 00:42:53.904 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
MAKE IT.

00:42:53.971 --> 00:42:55.572 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AT IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO

00:42:55.639 --> 00:42:56.774 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SEE BUT I UNDERSTAND EXACTLY

00:42:56.840 --> 00:42:57.341 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT I

00:42:57.408 --> 00:42:59.043 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
THINK.

00:42:59.109 --> 00:43:01.011 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
MOST OF CALIFORNIA.

00:43:01.078 --> 00:43:02.913 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
IS IN A CRITICAL STE

00:43:02.980 --> 00:43:05.549 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
STAGE OF HOUSING AFFORD OR LACK

00:43:05.616 --> 00:43:07.685 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
OF AFFORDABILITY AND SO. I DON'T

00:43:07.751 --> 00:43:08.419 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THINK THIS IS GOING TO BE AN

00:43:08.485 --> 00:43:10.321 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
EASY CHOICE BUT WE NEED SOME

00:43:10.387 --> 00:43:11.789 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
REALLY GOOD MODELS TO TELL US

00:43:11.855 --> 00:43:13.757 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WHETHER THIS WORKS AND WHETHER

00:43:13.824 --> 00:43:14.825 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THERE ARE SOME THINGS WE OUGHT

00:43:14.892 --> 00:43:16.193 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TO BE DOING DIFFERENTLY. THAT

00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:17.995 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WILL HELP STUDENTS FIND HOUSING

00:43:18.062 --> 00:43:19.296 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
AROUND THE CAMPUSES.

00:43:19.363 --> 00:43:20.731 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
I ALSO WANNA.

00:43:20.798 --> 00:43:24.134 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
I THINK DR POT LOPEZ FOR COMING

00:43:24.201 --> 00:43:25.469 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND FOR SHARING HER STORY AND I

00:43:25.536 --> 00:43:26.770 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THINK PART OF THE CHALLENGE THAT

00:43:26.837 --> 00:43:28.739 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
WE FOUND. IN FRESNO IS THAT

00:43:28.806 --> 00:43:30.007 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
STUDENTS ARE SO EMBARRASSED TO

00:43:30.074 --> 00:43:31.342 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BE HOMELESS THAT THEY JUST DON'T

00:43:31.408 --> 00:43:32.309 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WANT TO COME FORWARD AND SO I

00:43:32.376 --> 00:43:33.978 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
KNOW HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO

00:43:34.044 --> 00:43:36.046 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ADMIT. TO HAVE BEEN IN TO HAVE

00:43:36.113 --> 00:43:37.281 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
BEEN IN THAT SITUATION AND I

00:43:37.348 --> 00:43:38.782 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
APPRECIATE HER.

00:43:38.849 --> 00:43:41.919 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%

IT EXPERIENCE AND HER

00:43:44.254 --> 00:43:45.723 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WILLINGNESS TO SHARE IT WITH US

00:43:45.789 --> 00:43:47.057 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IT THAT THAT MAKES IT SOUND SO

00:43:47.124 --> 00:43:47.891 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
POWERFUL.

00:43:47.958 --> 00:43:50.260 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
AND ALSO I THINK MR MR EACH

00:43:50.327 --> 00:43:52.496 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
YEAR IS THOUGH FOR FOR COMING

00:43:52.563 --> 00:43:55.065 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ALL THIS WAY AS WELL THIS IS A

00:43:55.132 --> 00:43:58.869 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
CRITICAL. IN IN MY REGION IT CSU

AT CSU AND I'M EXTREMELY

00:44:02.406 --> 00:44:03.874 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
EXPENSIVE AND PEOPLE ARE THAT

00:44:03.941 --> 00:44:05.175 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
STUDENTS ARE LIVING IN THEIR

00:44:05.242 --> 00:44:08.412 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
CARS AND I I CANNOT IMAGINE WHAT

IT'S LIKE.

00:44:09.279 --> 00:44:10.848 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TO TRY TO GO TO COLLEGE WHICH

00:44:10.914 --> 00:44:12.282 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
WAS DIFFICULT ENOUGH.

00:44:12.349 --> 00:44:14.685 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AN NBA HOMELESS AND SO THE MORE

00:44:14.752 --> 00:44:16.086 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%

ABOUT IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR

01:07:41.023 --> 01:07:42.291 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
INSTITUTIONS WHOSE BUDGETS ARE

01:07:42.358 --> 01:07:42.858 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
UNDER A MILLION DOLLARS FOR

01:07:42.925 --> 01:07:44.760 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
ATHLETICS. UP TO OUR LARGER

01:07:44.827 --> 01:07:45.628 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%

BILL OF RIGHTS.

01:07:47.930 --> 01:07:49.465 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%

DOESN'T COVER TUITION.

01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:52.902 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
AND SO OUR INSTITUTIONS ARE

01:07:52.968 --> 01:07:53.669 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
STRUGGLING TO MEET THE FINANCIAL

SIMPLY ISSUE BECOMES.

01:08:03.579 --> 01:08:04.013 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
DEPENDING ON HOW THIS

INSTRUCTED THAT THE INSTITUTIONS

01:08:06.148 --> 01:08:07.216 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%

MAY HAVE THE RESOURCES TO DO SO.

01:08:13.689 --> 01:08:14.623 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%

DISPIRITING AMONGST THE

01:11:40.129 --> 01:11:42.164 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BE EXPLORED THEY WERE THEY WERE

INDEED.

01:11:42.798 --> 01:11:44.500 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
CHALLENGING WE NEEDED TO HAVE.

.

01:11:46.168 --> 01:11:47.469 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME TO

SORT OF FIGURE OUT HOW TOWARD

01:11:49.004 --> 01:11:50.606 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ARCHITECT TO A STRATEGY AROUND

01:11:50.673 --> 01:11:53.308 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THEM. BUT I THINK THAT THESE TO

01:11:53.375 --> 01:11:54.043 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
GIVE.

01:11:54.109 --> 01:11:55.110 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
SEARCHED CERTAINLY WITH A

01:11:55.177 --> 01:11:56.645 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
MANDATED REPORTER I THINK IT

01:11:56.712 --> 01:11:58.380 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
REALLY DOES BEEF UP BECAUSE WE

01:11:58.447 --> 01:12:00.716 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
HAVE ALREADY SEEN. INSTANCES OF

01:12:00.783 --> 01:12:03.118 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WHERE. A SOMETHING FELL THROUGH

01:12:03.185 --> 01:12:04.687 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THE CRACKS AND SO THIS IS AN

01:12:04.753 --> 01:12:06.855 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
ATTEMPT TO TRY TO.

01:12:06.922 --> 01:12:08.257 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
A PLUG BET UP IN AN AS A REAL

01:12:08.323 --> 01:12:10.526 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
PLACE TO THE OF THE FUND.

01:12:10.592 --> 01:12:12.494 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
IT'S A MECHANISM THAT WE'RE

01:12:12.561 --> 01:12:15.464 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
CREATING AND SCHOOLS WILL HAVE

01:12:15.531 --> 01:12:16.665 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
THE OPPORTUNITY TO.

01:12:16.732 --> 01:12:18.667 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
TO USE IT.

01:12:18.734 --> 01:12:22.037 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ARM AND DETERMINE HOW. TO USE IT

01:12:22.104 --> 01:12:23.505 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
WHO AYE IF WE LOOK AT THE

01:12:23.572 --> 01:12:25.474 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
O'BANNON CASE.

01:12:25.541 --> 01:12:27.543 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
OF THAT IS NOT INCONSISTENT WITH

WHAT THE COURT HAD DETERMINE

01:12:29.011 --> 01:12:30.746 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
THEIR FINDINGS.

01:12:30.813 --> 01:12:32.081 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
HAD IT BEEN IN PLACE IT MIGHT

01:12:32.147 --> 01:12:33.682 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
HAVE BEEN AN EASIER PLACE FOR

01:12:33.749 --> 01:12:35.250 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE JUDGE TO SAY HERE'S HOW YOU

01:12:37.086 --> 01:12:38.687 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AND HERE'S HOW IN THE CASE OF

01:12:38.754 --> 01:12:39.988 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
THE LOWER COURT THE FIVE

01:12:40.055 --> 01:12:41.523 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THOUSAND DOLLARS WOULD BE.

01:12:41.590 --> 01:12:43.692 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
HOW COULD BE HANDLED AND THIS

01:12:43.759 --> 01:12:45.894 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%

THEIR EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY

AND THERE WERE RESOURCES THERE

01:12:58.173 --> 01:13:01.376 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TO DRAW UPON. AND SO. I THINK

01:13:01.443 --> 01:13:02.177 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%

01:37:29.643 --> 01:37:31.178 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WHEN THEY SAY WHEN THEY SEE THAT

01:37:31.245 --> 01:37:32.413 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THEY NEED TRANSPORTATION TO GET

FINANCIAL AID FOR THAT. THAT

01:37:43.390 --> 01:37:44.158 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
CREATES A PROBLEM LEADS TO KIDS.

01:37:44.225 --> 01:37:45.893 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
YOUNG PEOPLE WORKING MORE HOURS

01:37:45.960 --> 01:37:47.127 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WHICH IMPACTS THEIR ACADEMIC

01:37:47.194 --> 01:37:48.262 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SUCCESS OR MAYBE EVEN DROP OUT

01:37:48.329 --> 01:37:49.263 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
OF SCHOOL WHICH CERTAINLY

01:37:49.330 --> 01:37:50.898 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IMPACTS ACADEMIC SUCCESS SO. IT

01:37:50.965 --> 01:37:52.866 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR MORE

01:37:52.933 --> 01:37:54.935 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
MORE ROBUST FINANCIAL SUPPORT

01:37:55.002 --> 01:37:56.737 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT REALLY MATCHES THE COSTS OF

01:37:56.804 --> 01:37:58.505 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
COLLEGE DOES THAT DOES THAT THEN

01:37:58.572 --> 01:37:59.907 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
MEAN THAT FEWER STUDENTS WILL

01:37:59.974 --> 01:38:02.443 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
RECEIVE FINANCIAL SYSTEM.

01:38:02.509 --> 01:38:03.944 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IF THE AMOUNT THAT ONE STUDENT

01:38:04.011 --> 01:38:05.479 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
RECEIVED HIS HIGHER.

01:38:05.546 --> 01:38:08.082 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAN WHAT WE HAVE NOW DOES THAT

01:38:08.148 --> 01:38:09.383 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
MEAN I MEAN SO MUCH TO TALK

01:38:09.450 --> 01:38:10.618 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ABOUT THESE FINANCIALLY POT IS

01:38:10.684 --> 01:38:12.119 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IF THEIR NEVER ENDING THAT THEY

01:38:12.186 --> 01:38:13.754 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
EXIST. AND THAT THERE IS A

01:38:13.821 --> 01:38:15.422 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
FINITE NUMBER THAT'S THE AMOUNT

01:38:15.489 --> 01:38:18.392 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
THAT WE DO SO THERE'S THIS
MEANS.

01:38:18.459 --> 01:38:19.159 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
FEWER STUDENTS WILL GET

01:38:19.226 --> 01:38:20.361 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE BUT THOSE

01:38:20.427 --> 01:38:21.462 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WHO GET IT THEY GET AT A HIGHER

01:38:21.528 --> 01:38:25.966 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
RATE THAT'S A QUESTION.

01:38:26.033 --> 01:38:27.935 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
I DON'T KNOW BUT.

01:38:28.002 --> 01:38:29.403 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
I I UNDERSTAND THAT THAT THE

01:38:29.470 --> 01:38:30.871 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
LOGIC AND THE LICKED THE

01:38:30.938 --> 01:38:31.572 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
CONCEPTUAL.

01:38:31.639 --> 01:38:33.607 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AND HOUSES AND BUILT INTO THE

01:38:33.674 --> 01:38:34.108 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
QUESTION.

01:38:34.174 --> 01:38:36.310 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
IT COULD BE THAT BECAUSE THE

01:38:36.377 --> 01:38:37.611 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
COST FOR STUDENTS ARE GOING

01:38:37.678 --> 01:38:38.779 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
HIGHER THAN THAN.

01:38:38.846 --> 01:38:39.613 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
CERTAIN UNIVERSITIES WITH

01:38:39.680 --> 01:38:41.382 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%

THE FINANCIAL AID.

01:38:43.083 --> 01:38:43.751 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
IT COULD BE IF THEY'RE IN

01:38:43.817 --> 01:38:45.185 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
FINANCIAL STRAITS THAT THEY

01:38:45.252 --> 01:38:46.220 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO FUNDED AS

01:38:46.287 --> 01:38:47.087 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
FROM MORE ABOUT HIS PAST AS

01:38:47.154 --> 01:38:47.855 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
ROBUST AS POSSIBLE BUT THIS

01:38:47.921 --> 01:38:49.089 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
PROVIDES THE OPPORTUNITY FOR IT

01:38:49.156 --> 01:38:51.659 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TO BE FUNDED. AND AND AND MORE

01:38:51.725 --> 01:38:53.494 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ROBUST WAYS FOR FOR STUDENTS.

01:38:53.560 --> 01:38:54.428 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WHENEVER YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:38:54.495 --> 01:38:55.729 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SORT OF ZERO SIMON AND LIMITED

01:38:55.796 --> 01:38:57.831 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
PIES THEN.

01:38:57.898 --> 01:38:59.133 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
THEN YOUR YOU KNOW YOUR
QUESTION.

01:38:59.199 --> 01:39:01.001 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
COULD RAISE CONCERN BUT WE HOPE

01:39:01.068 --> 01:39:02.436 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THAT FINANCIAL AID WILL GROW

01:39:02.503 --> 01:39:03.604 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WITH THE INCREASING ELIGIBILITY

01:39:03.671 --> 01:39:05.072 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
IN THIS BILL.

SCHOOL NOT ONLY THE FINANCIAL

01:39:38.372 --> 01:39:39.239 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%

TUITION PAID FOR THE BOOKS THEIR

01:39:50.651 --> 01:39:52.319 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
LODGING. AND AND FOOD AND THOSE

01:39:52.386 --> 01:39:53.420 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
KINDS OF THINGS WOULD COULD THEY

PROBABLY NOT YOU KNOW AT THAT

01:39:58.525 --> 01:39:59.626 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
POINT WAS TO GET A SCHOLARSHIP

01:39:59.693 --> 01:40:00.861 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%

OF THIS FACTORS INTO WHAT I

01:40:15.609 --> 01:40:16.510 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THINK PERSONALLY THAT THE STATE

01:40:16.577 --> 01:40:17.678 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
OUGHT TO BE FUNDING FOR STUDENTS

01:40:17.745 --> 01:40:20.681 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TO GO TO COLLEGE THAT THAT'S THE

01:40:20.748 --> 01:40:21.048 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
ONLY THING. SO.

01:40:21.115 --> 01:40:21.982 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

NOW SUPPORTED AND I AM CONCERNED

01:40:23.150 --> 01:40:23.684 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SOMETIMES THAT THAT WE'VE RUN

01:40:23.751 --> 01:40:25.052 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
OUT OF MONEY.

01:40:25.119 --> 01:40:26.286 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BUT SOME SOME AND THEREFORE SOME

01:40:26.353 --> 01:40:28.922 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
STUDENTS DON'T GET MONEY FOR.

01:40:28.989 --> 01:40:30.357 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TUITION AND BOOKS IN THOSE KINDS

01:40:30.424 --> 01:40:30.991 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
OF THINGS THAT THEY NEED TO HAVE

01:40:31.058 --> 01:40:32.092 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BECAUSE THERE IS A THERE IS A

DIFFERENT CATEGORY FOR SUPPORT.

AND ONE OF THINGS I WOULD HATE

01:55:16.676 --> 01:55:18.177 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%

AS WELL AS OTHER KINDS OF THINGS

01:55:32.325 --> 01:55:33.526 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THAT ARE THERE. WE SOMETIMES

01:55:33.593 --> 01:55:35.128 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SCRUB ALL THE INFORMATION SO WE

01:55:35.194 --> 01:55:36.162 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DON'T KNOW FOR MEETING THE NEEDS

01:55:36.229 --> 01:55:37.797 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OF DIVERSE STUDENT POPULATIONS

01:55:37.864 --> 01:55:38.631 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW WHO THEY

01:55:38.698 --> 01:55:40.533 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ARE. OF BECAUSE WE CAN'T ASK

01:55:40.600 --> 01:55:42.101 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
PEOPLE OF QUESTIONS ABOUT THEIR

01:55:42.168 --> 01:55:43.670 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%

ABOUT IT I THINK OF.

01:55:49.909 --> 01:55:50.910 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%

AT IT WILL LOOK AT IT AND BEGIN

01:55:52.478 --> 01:55:53.346 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%

01:57:05.418 --> 01:57:07.019 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
CERTAIN NEEDS TO THAT HAVE TO

01:57:07.086 --> 01:57:08.821 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PRE PLANNED SOME OF THAT SO? I'M

01:57:08.888 --> 01:57:11.157 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
GOING TO SUPPORT THIS TODAY AND

01:57:11.224 --> 01:57:12.225 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
HOPE THAT.

01:57:12.291 --> 01:57:12.892 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT AS WE LOOK AT IT A IT'S A

01:57:12.959 --> 01:57:14.460 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IT'S A REALLY A MATTER OF TRYING

01:57:14.527 --> 01:57:16.429 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TO FIGURE OUT HOW AN APPLICATION

01:57:16.496 --> 01:57:18.131 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
CAN HAVE AS YOU POINT OUT THE

01:57:18.197 --> 01:57:18.798 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
CENTRAL INFORMATION PEOPLE NEED

01:57:18.865 --> 01:57:19.899 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
TO HAVE.

01:57:19.966 --> 01:57:21.134 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BUT NOT NECESSARILY GETTING TO

01:57:21.200 --> 01:57:22.468 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
A POINT WE HAVE SUCH AS BEEN

01:57:22.535 --> 01:57:24.303 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
APPLICATION THAT IT THAT

01:57:24.370 --> 01:57:25.638 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
EVERYBODY LOOKS THE SAME.

01:57:25.705 --> 01:57:27.206 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
YOU KNOW EVERYBODY'S APPLIED WE

01:57:27.273 --> 01:57:28.908 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
GOT ALL WE KNOW IS THAT WE HAVE

01:57:28.975 --> 01:57:30.109 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
OF FOUR HUNDRED STUDENTS COME A

01:57:30.176 --> 01:57:31.577 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
WILL MOST A MALE FEMALE OR

01:57:31.644 --> 01:57:33.012 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WHATEVER. WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER

01:57:33.079 --> 01:57:35.348 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OUR LGBT COMMUNITY NEEDS TO BE

01:57:35.415 --> 01:57:37.083 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ALL SUPPORTED MORE BECAUSE NOW

01:57:37.150 --> 01:57:38.518 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WE GOT STUDENTS AT IT THIS WAY

01:57:38.584 --> 01:57:40.720 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND OFTEN EVEN VETERAN STATUS IT

01:57:40.787 --> 01:57:42.121 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ON CAMPUS WILL DETERMINE WHETHER

01:57:42.188 --> 01:57:43.890 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT. THEIR VETERAN SERVICES.

01:57:43.956 --> 01:57:45.858 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
IT IN ANY GREAT NUMBERS SO.

01:57:45.925 --> 01:57:46.492 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
THAT.

01:57:46.559 --> 01:57:47.660 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THESE KIND OF QUESTIONS ARE ARE

01:57:47.727 --> 01:57:49.162 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IMPORTANT AND I THINK MAYBE IT

01:57:49.228 --> 01:57:50.630 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
YOU SAY AFTER THEY'VE BEEN ROLE

01:57:50.696 --> 01:57:52.632 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THEY COULD BE IT BENEFICIAL. BUT

01:57:52.698 --> 01:57:54.267 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
OFTENTIMES THE PRE PLANNING FOR

01:57:54.333 --> 01:57:55.701 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WHO'S COMING IS ALSO IMPORTANT

01:57:55.768 --> 01:57:57.603 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OF BECAUSE IF YOU GET STUDENTS

01:57:57.670 --> 01:57:59.205 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WHO HAVE CERTAIN NEEDS. LASTING

01:57:59.272 --> 01:58:00.706 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WANT DO IS F. I'M AS NEEDS OUT

01:58:00.773 --> 01:58:02.642 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
IN IN WEEK FIVE OF THE SCHOOL

01:58:02.708 --> 01:58:04.544 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WHEN WITH WE FOUND AND WEEK ONE

01:58:04.610 --> 01:58:05.478 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
YOU MAY PUT TOGETHER DIFFERENT

01:58:05.545 --> 01:58:07.914 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
KIND OF. OF THE STUDY GROUPS OR

01:58:07.980 --> 01:58:10.016 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
OR RESOURCE IS A WHATEVER TO

01:58:10.082 --> 01:58:10.950 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
HELP STUDENTS TO BE SUCCESSFUL.

01:58:11.017 --> 01:58:12.452 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SO I WOULD HOPE THAT IN IN THE

01:58:12.518 --> 01:58:13.719 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SCRUBBING OF THE APPLICATIONS IN

01:58:13.786 --> 01:58:15.354 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE ASSESSMENT WE WOULD GET TO

01:58:15.421 --> 01:58:16.722 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE THINGS THAT I REALLY CENTRAL

01:58:16.789 --> 01:58:17.824 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BUT NOT ENOUGH SO HE THOUGHT THE

01:58:17.890 --> 01:58:19.025 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BABY WITH THE BATHWATER BECAUSE

01:58:19.091 --> 01:58:20.726 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
WE MAY BE ELIMINATING. THE

01:58:20.793 --> 01:58:22.195 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
OPPORTUNITY FOR SOME SERVICES

01:58:22.261 --> 01:58:24.063 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT STUDENTS WOULD WOULD GET AS

01:58:24.130 --> 01:58:25.198 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
A RESULT OF THE DATA. AND

01:58:25.264 --> 01:58:27.333 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
APPLICATIONS THEMSELVES ALWAYS

01:58:27.400 --> 01:58:27.934 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
DIFFICULT I HATE FILLING THEM

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:28.668 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
OUT BUT.

01:58:28.734 --> 01:58:29.902 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SO THOSE THINGS YOU HAVE TO DO

01:58:29.969 --> 01:58:31.671 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BUT I APPRECIATE BRING IT TO OUR

01:58:31.737 --> 01:58:33.072 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ATTENTION AND THE I HOPE THE

01:58:33.139 --> 01:58:34.240 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
PROCESS THAT THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE

01:58:34.307 --> 01:58:36.642 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
WILL BE LOOKING AT.

01:58:36.709 --> 01:58:38.311 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%

HAS SO MUCH INSIGHT WHAT THE

01:58:41.914 --> 01:58:44.484 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
DATA BUT ON THIS I THINK IT'S.

01:58:44.550 --> 01:58:47.386 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IN THE CLIMATE WE ARE IN A WHEN

01:58:47.453 --> 01:58:49.789 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IT COMES TO APPLICATIONS WHETHER

01:58:49.856 --> 01:58:51.991 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%

01:58:52.058 --> 01:58:53.893 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
FILLING OUT UP FAST OF FORUMS

01:58:53.960 --> 01:58:55.361 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
ALL OF THESE OTHER TYPES OF

01:58:55.428 --> 01:58:56.762 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
FORUMS. I THINK THERE IS SOME

01:58:56.829 --> 01:58:58.764 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
FEAR RELATED TO AND SO A FEW OF

01:58:58.831 --> 01:59:00.633 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THOSE QUESTIONS THAT YOU KNOW

01:59:00.700 --> 01:59:02.101 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
YOU STARTLE YOU KNOW IF THEY

01:59:02.168 --> 01:59:03.836 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WORKED IN AGRICULTURE I MEAN.

01:59:03.903 --> 01:59:05.638 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%

01:59:05.705 --> 01:59:08.508 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
TOWARDS A CERTAIN TYPE OF A.

01:59:30.363 --> 01:59:31.831 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WE THINK THE INTENT OF COLLEGES

01:59:31.898 --> 01:59:33.266 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THROUGHOUT THE STATE IS NOT TO

LOSE THIS IMPORTANT DEMOGRAPHIC

01:59:35.935 --> 01:59:37.503 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%

REALLY SHAPE STUDENT SERVICES.

01:59:40.006 --> 01:59:42.208 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BUT IT'S REALLY ENSURING THAT.

01:59:42.275 --> 01:59:44.644 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
WE INSIST THAT STUDENTS DO

01:59:44.710 --> 01:59:46.546 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
CONTINUE TO APPLY AND THEN DO

01:59:46.612 --> 01:59:47.713 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%

STUDENTS THAT LOOKED THROUGH IT

01:59:53.986 --> 01:59:55.354 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND FIGURE OUT YOU KNOW WHERE.

01:59:55.421 --> 01:59:57.290 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%

REQUIRE THE CSU TO PUT IN PLACE

AT THIS I THINK HEARING IT WAS

02:48:38.475 --> 02:48:39.709 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
DISCUSSED THAT THERE WERE MAJOR

03:07:37.412 --> 03:07:38.614 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
SUPPORTIVE OF REMOVING THE

SUNSET FOR TWO REASONS.

03:07:39.648 --> 03:07:40.582 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
ONE.

03:07:40.649 --> 03:07:42.384 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND THIS IS OF MORE A FUNCTION

03:07:42.451 --> 03:07:44.653 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
OF HOW MUCH WE ARE RIGHT NOW.

03:07:44.720 --> 03:07:46.788 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%

UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND

03:07:52.160 --> 03:07:53.228 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT WE AS A LEGISLATURE SHOULD

03:07:53.295 --> 03:07:54.830 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BE A PARTNER IN THAT BEST VALUE

03:07:54.896 --> 03:07:56.331 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
IS PART OF IT BUT I THINK.

03:07:56.398 --> 03:07:57.899 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
IT IS APPROPRIATE TO HAVE A

03:07:57.966 --> 03:07:59.468 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SUNSET JUST BY VIRTUE OF THE

03:07:59.534 --> 03:08:00.869 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
FACT THEY'RE SO MUCH CHANGE THAT

03:08:04.506 --> 03:08:05.674 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
ADMINISTRATIVE PRACTICES

03:08:05.741 --> 03:08:07.209 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
INCLUDING IN CONTRACTING.

03:08:07.275 --> 03:08:07.943 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
AND I SO I THINK IT'S

03:08:08.010 --> 03:08:09.344 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
APPROPRIATE TO HAVE A SUNSET AND

03:08:09.411 --> 03:08:11.079 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SECONDLY BEST VALUE ISN'T ISN'T

03:08:11.146 --> 03:08:12.481 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
NOT.

03:08:12.547 --> 03:08:14.983 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE LOWEST BID SO I THINK IT'S

03:08:15.050 --> 03:08:16.318 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IMPORTANT FOR OUR CONSTITUENTS

03:08:16.385 --> 03:08:17.819 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ARE TAXPAYERS TO MAKE SURE THAT

ON A REGULAR BASIS WE ARE

03:08:19.287 --> 03:08:20.656 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%

ALWAYS WORKING THE WAY IT

03:08:22.391 --> 03:08:22.958 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
AND.

03:08:23.025 --> 03:08:24.559 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
THAT MAY MEAN A FIVE YEAR

03:08:24.626 --> 03:08:25.594 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
SUNSET THAT'S A PRETTY

03:08:25.661 --> 03:08:26.595 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF TIME

03:08:26.662 --> 03:08:27.963 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
PARTICULARLY FOR CONTRACTING IN

BUDGET PLANNING AND OTHERWISE

03:08:29.865 --> 03:08:31.233 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
BUT I THINK FOR PURPOSES OF.

03:08:31.299 --> 03:08:34.002 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
BOTH THE PUBLIC TRUST AND

03:08:34.069 --> 03:08:35.537 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ALWAYS REEVALUATING BEST BUY IS

03:08:35.604 --> 03:08:37.339 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
THE WAY TO GO.

03:08:37.406 --> 03:08:38.540 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AS OPPOSED TO LOWEST BIDDING.

03:08:38.607 --> 03:08:40.242 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT WE NEED TO HAVE THAT CHECK

03:08:40.308 --> 03:08:41.410 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
IN REGULARLY SO.

03:08:41.476 --> 03:08:43.111 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
