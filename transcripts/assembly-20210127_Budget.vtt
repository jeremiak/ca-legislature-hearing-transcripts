UNPLEASANT. WE DON'T WANT THAT

00:57:15.532 --> 00:57:16.065
TO BE HAPPENING TO OUR

00:57:16.132 --> 00:57:18.568
CONSTITUENTS. IN ONE SURVEY

CALIFORNIA TENANTS. THERE

00:57:22.038 --> 00:57:23.039
BEHIND A RED AT THE END OF

NEGOTIATION IN THIS PROPOSAL IT

00:57:46.529 --> 00:57:48.865
DOES GIVE TOO MUCH POWER. TO

00:57:48.932 --> 00:57:50.266
LANDLORDS WHO TRADITIONALLY

00:57:50.333 --> 00:57:51.467
HAVE A POWER IMBALANCE OVER THE

00:57:51.534 --> 00:57:52.836
TESTS SO I HAVE A COUPLE

00:57:52.902 --> 00:57:54.270
QUESTIONS TO THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:57:54.337 --> 00:57:55.872

CALIFORNIANS. SO MY FIRST

00:58:05.648 --> 00:58:08.418
QUESTION IS. LOOKING OVER THE

00:58:08.484 --> 00:58:10.787
BILL IF A LANDLORD OPTS INTO

00:58:10.854 --> 00:58:12.922

TENANT THAT IS ELIGIBLE THAT

00:58:15.859 --> 00:58:19.095
OWES BACK RENT. AT ONE TIME. OR

00:58:19.162 --> 00:58:21.097
ARE THEY ALLOW DISCRETION TO

00:58:21.164 --> 00:58:23.800
PICK WHICH TENANT IS ALL OF THE

00:58:23.867 --> 00:58:25.735
PROGRAM. THAT'S MY FIRST

00:58:25.802 --> 00:58:29.372
QUESTION OTHER THAN ONE ATTACK.

00:58:29.439 --> 00:58:30.540
YES CAN I TURN THAT QUESTION

00:58:30.607 --> 00:58:32.208
OVER TO- ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES

00:58:32.275 --> 00:58:38.615

FOR ALL THE TIME OR THEY CAN DO

00:58:47.523 --> 00:58:49.292
SO ON A ROLLING BASIS. OKAY

00:58:49.359 --> 00:58:51.361

DEBT 25% DEBT OWED REQUIRED TO

STATE HOUSE. THAT FEELS TO ME

00:59:11.948 --> 00:59:13.783
LIKE A DIRECT UNICAL INEQUITY

00:59:13.850 --> 00:59:17.253
AN IMBALANCE SO WHERE WOULD THE

00:59:17.320 --> 00:59:17.854

I'M SURE WINNER WHEN WE THOUGHT

01:00:17.347 --> 01:00:19.248
WHEN THE POLICE AFTER THE

01:00:19.315 --> 01:00:20.149
STRUCTURE THERE WERE A COUPLE

01:00:20.216 --> 01:00:22.118
THINGS THAT WERE BOUNDING THE

01:00:22.185 --> 01:00:23.853
CONVERSATION TO BEGIN WITH IN

01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:25.154
THE FIRST IS THAT THE FEDERAL

01:00:25.221 --> 01:00:27.957
PROGRAM- AT REQUIRED FOR THAT

01:00:28.024 --> 01:00:30.393
THE OFFER GO TO EVEN GO TO THE

LANDLORD AND THAT WE WORK WITH

01:00:31.394 --> 01:00:33.396
A LANDMARK- AND ONLY SHOULD THE

01:00:33.463 --> 01:00:35.098
LANDLORD NOT BE PARTICIPATING

01:00:35.164 --> 01:00:37.233
THEN DO WE THEN GO THROUGH TO

01:00:37.300 --> 01:00:38.568
THAT HAND ON THE BACK PART OF

01:00:38.634 --> 01:00:40.303
THE FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS. AND

01:00:40.370 --> 01:00:42.038
THEN WHEN WE WERE LOOKINGAT

01:00:42.105 --> 01:00:44.307
THE- THE BALANCE BETWEEN THE

01:00:44.374 --> 01:00:46.876
80% OF THE 20% THANK FIRST

01:00:46.943 --> 01:00:47.477
THERE WAS THAT THEY WERE THE

01:00:47.543 --> 01:00:49.612
PROGRAM TO INCENTIVIZE THE

01:00:49.679 --> 01:00:50.847
LANDLORD TO PARTICIPATE BECAUSE

01:00:50.913 --> 01:00:53.483
BACK INTO THE ABILITY TO THAN

01:00:53.549 --> 01:00:55.151
TO BE ABLE TO- ARRAY THE

01:00:55.218 --> 01:00:57.787
REMAINING RENTAL ARREARS AND IF

01:00:57.854 --> 01:00:59.689
THERE'S A THOUGHT AROUND THE

01:00:59.756 --> 01:01:02.358
80% TWENTY TWENTY FIVE- IS THAT

01:01:02.425 --> 01:01:03.426
IF YOU GET TO THE TENANT

01:01:03.493 --> 01:01:04.660
PARTICIPATION THEN THAT'S FINE

01:01:04.727 --> 01:01:07.330
THEN THAT THAT 25% IS ENOUGH TO

01:01:07.397 --> 01:01:08.464
ENSURE THAT THE TIME AND WILL

01:01:08.531 --> 01:01:11.067
CONTINUE TO A HOUSE UNDER THE

01:01:11.134 --> 01:01:12.168
EXTENSION OF THE REGULATORY

01:01:12.235 --> 01:01:15.171
PROCESS- BUT THE GOAL WOULD BE

01:01:15.238 --> 01:01:16.806
TO BE ABLE TO REMOVE AS MUCH-

01:01:16.873 --> 01:01:18.307
RENTAL THAT AS POSSIBLE WHICH

01:01:18.374 --> 01:01:24.580
IS ACHIEVED. ONLY THROUGH THE

01:01:24.647 --> 01:01:25.181
DIRECT LANDMARK PAYMENT. OKAY

01:01:25.248 --> 01:01:26.115
THANK YOU. I DEFINITELY. THAT

01:01:26.182 --> 01:01:26.749
AND I UNDER. AND WANT TO

01:01:26.816 --> 01:01:27.683
INCENTIVE LAND FOR JUST SO I DO

01:01:27.750 --> 01:01:29.652
HAVE. THAT FOUGHT. IT DOES ODD

01:01:29.719 --> 01:01:30.853
TO ME THAT WHEN A LANDLORD

01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:32.522
APPRECIATE A PROACTIVE TENANT

01:01:32.588 --> 01:01:33.923
APPLYING FOR THEMSELVES. SO IT

01:01:33.990 --> 01:01:35.224
SEEMS QUITE PUNITIVE TO A

01:01:35.291 --> 01:01:36.859
TENANT WHO WOULD TAKE EFFORTS

01:01:36.926 --> 01:01:38.561
INTO THEIR OWN HANDS TO. APPLY

01:01:38.628 --> 01:01:39.929
FOR IT. SO I REALLY HOPE IN THE

01:01:39.996 --> 01:01:41.931
FUTURE IF WE HAVE MORE. FUNDS

01:01:41.998 --> 01:01:42.765
COVER THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AS

01:01:42.832 --> 01:01:44.700
WE ARE HOPEFUL FOR. THAT THIS

01:01:44.767 --> 01:01:48.738
SPLIT IN DEBT. DEBT PAYOFF

01:01:48.805 --> 01:01:49.338
ESSENTIALLY IS MUCH MUCH MORE

01:01:49.405 --> 01:01:52.075
EQUITABLE. SINCE OBVIOUSLY THE

01:01:52.141 --> 01:01:54.077
MONEY GOES ALANLAR DIRECTLY

01:01:54.143 --> 01:01:54.677
ANYWAYS IT DOESN'T POCKET INTO

01:01:54.744 --> 01:01:56.846
THE TENANT. ALL RIGHT WELL MY

01:01:56.913 --> 01:02:00.116
THIRD QUESTION IS THIS I'M- I

01:02:00.183 --> 01:02:01.217
APPRECIATE OVIOUSLY THE SPEED

01:02:01.284 --> 01:02:02.585
WITH ONE AND GETS THE MONEY OUT

01:02:02.652 --> 01:02:04.487
BY MARCH BUT I AM WORRIED THERE

01:02:04.554 --> 01:02:06.155
MIGHT BE A REPEAT AND OBVIOUSLY

01:02:06.222 --> 01:02:07.190
THIS IS WHY THE DATA METRICS

01:02:07.256 --> 01:02:08.424
ARE IMPORTANT I AM WORRIED

01:02:08.491 --> 01:02:09.292
THERE COULD BE A REPEAT OF THE

01:02:09.358 --> 01:02:11.627
PPP LOAN FIASCO FROM TWENTY

01:02:11.694 --> 01:02:13.563
TWENTY- WE'RE BIG BUSINESSES

01:02:13.629 --> 01:02:14.831
AND CORPORATIONS. EIGHT UP THE

01:02:14.897 --> 01:02:16.032
LINE SHARES OF THESE FUNDS

01:02:16.099 --> 01:02:18.134
BEFORE SMALL BUSINESSES COULD

01:02:18.201 --> 01:02:20.036
APPLY. I HAVE THE SAME CONCERN

01:02:20.103 --> 01:02:21.437
THAT SMALL LANDLORDS MAY NOT

01:02:21.504 --> 01:02:23.339
GET THE CHANCE APPLY. THE OUTER

01:02:23.406 --> 01:02:26.342
NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN- SO HOW

01:02:26.409 --> 01:02:27.577
WILL WE ENSURE THAT SMALL

01:02:27.643 --> 01:02:28.911
LANDLORDS WHO MAY ONLY BE

01:02:28.978 --> 01:02:30.079
RENTING OUT THEIR SECOND HOMES

01:02:30.146 --> 01:02:32.048
OR TRIPLEX WITH A FEW TENANTS

01:02:32.115 --> 01:02:33.483
THAT THEY HAVE KEPT ON IN GOOD

01:02:33.549 --> 01:02:35.551
FAITH MAY NOT. WHO MAY NOT

01:02:35.618 --> 01:02:37.053
POSSESS THE RESOURCES THAT

01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:38.287
CORPORATE LANDLORDS HAVE HAVE

01:02:38.354 --> 01:02:40.790
PRIORITY IF NOT TACKLE ACCESS

01:02:40.857 --> 01:02:43.693
TO THESE REALLY FUNDS IN MARCH.

01:02:43.759 --> 01:02:45.995
YESTERDAY I'M JUST TO POINT OUT

01:02:46.062 --> 01:02:49.065
THAT- PART OF THE EXPECTATION

01:02:49.132 --> 01:02:50.766
OF THE THIRD PARTY IMPLEMENTOR

01:02:50.833 --> 01:02:52.802
IS THAT THEY PROVIDE TECHNICAL

01:02:52.869 --> 01:02:56.038
ASSISTANCE. AS WELL AS RUN A-

01:02:56.105 --> 01:02:59.342
ROBUST COMMUNICATION OUTREACH

PARTICIPANTS ACROSS THE STATE

01:03:02.712 --> 01:03:04.080
AND SO THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO

01:03:04.147 --> 01:03:06.215
US I THINK YOUR POINT. IS

01:03:06.282 --> 01:03:07.550
SOMETHING THAT WAS CONSIDERED

01:03:07.617 --> 01:03:09.352
IN THE PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT

01:03:09.418 --> 01:03:10.319
BECAUSE OF EXACTLY WHAT

01:03:10.386 --> 01:03:12.221

THE MONEY IT'S GOING TO BE

01:03:23.633 --> 01:03:25.334

AREA MEDIAN INCOME. OR WHO HAVE

01:03:35.778 --> 01:03:37.613

ADDRESS THE DEEPEST NEED THERE

01:03:40.917 --> 01:03:42.618
IN THAT FIRST ROUND- SO THAT'S

01:03:42.685 --> 01:03:44.353

IN THE DESIGN- AS IT'S BEEN

01:12:38.754 --> 01:12:40.289

01:13:11.353 --> 01:13:13.055

I THINK IS REALLY IMPORTANT IS

01:13:18.127 --> 01:13:19.461
THAT WE THOUGHT A LOT ABOUT

01:13:19.528 --> 01:13:21.396

ALLOCATED OUT TO ENTITIES BASED

01:16:23.912 --> 01:16:26.081
ON- POPULATION OR POPULATION

01:16:26.148 --> 01:16:28.450
BASIS. AND SO THOSE ENTITIES-

ENTITIES OF. POPULATIONS ABOUT

01:16:32.154 --> 01:16:33.655
ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND YES

01:16:33.722 --> 01:16:35.757
THEY WOULD ALSO BE. ELIGIBLE

01:16:35.824 --> 01:16:36.525
FOR A BLOCK GRANT THROUGH THE

01:16:36.591 --> 01:16:38.126
STATE PROGRAM AND THEY CAN

01:16:38.193 --> 01:16:39.761
DECIDE IF THEY WANT TO.

01:16:39.828 --> 01:16:41.396
PARTICIPATE IN THAT BLOCK GRANT

01:16:41.463 --> 01:16:42.731
THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO FOLLOW

01:16:42.798 --> 01:16:45.267
THE PROVISIONS OF THAT STATE

01:16:45.334 --> 01:16:46.668
RENTAL PROGRAM BUT SO THAT THEY

01:16:46.735 --> 01:16:48.270
COULD RECEIVE TO BLOCK GRANTS

01:16:48.337 --> 01:16:49.771
ONE IS A DIRECT ONE FROM THE U.

01:16:49.838 --> 01:16:50.939
S. TREASURY AND A SECOND ONE

01:16:51.006 --> 01:16:54.176
WOULD BE. THROUGH- EACH CD. SO

01:16:54.242 --> 01:16:55.310
START OF COUNTIES THAT ARE

01:16:55.377 --> 01:16:57.346
GREATER THAN FIVE HUNDRED

01:16:57.412 --> 01:16:58.146
THOUSAND ARE YOU SAYING COULD

01:16:58.213 --> 01:17:00.449
RECEIVE ADDITIONAL BLOCK GRANTS

01:17:00.515 --> 01:17:02.417
ADDITIONAL. FOR ABOVE AND

01:17:02.484 --> 01:17:04.119
BEYOND WHAT OTHER COUNTIES

01:17:04.186 --> 01:17:07.889
MIGHT BE ABLE TO RECEIVE. SO

01:17:07.956 --> 01:17:09.658
WHAT I'M SAYING IS THAT THEY

01:17:09.725 --> 01:17:11.426
WOULD RECEIVE A DIRECT GRANT

01:17:11.493 --> 01:17:13.195
ALREADY FROM THE FENCE AND THAT

01:17:13.261 --> 01:17:14.529
THEY WOULD ALSO BE ELIGIBLE TO

01:17:14.596 --> 01:17:16.031
RECEIVE GRANTS- GRANT DOLLARS

01:17:16.098 --> 01:17:18.533
FROM THE STATE PROGRAM- I PER

01:17:18.600 --> 01:17:21.303
PERSON- PER POPULATION BASED.

01:17:21.370 --> 01:17:23.538
YEAH AND THAT'S NOT JUST FIVE

01:17:23.605 --> 01:17:24.539
HUNDRED THOUSAND THAT'S EVERY

01:17:24.606 --> 01:17:26.842
EVERY. JURISDICTION IN ACCOUNT-

01:17:26.908 --> 01:17:27.909
IN THE IN THE STATE COULD

01:17:27.976 --> 01:17:29.578
RECEIVE AN ADDITIONAL AMOUNT OF

01:17:29.644 --> 01:17:31.046
DOLLARS. SO COULD A

01:17:31.113 --> 01:17:32.748
PROPORTIONALLY RECEIVE LARGER

01:17:32.814 --> 01:17:33.949
COUNTIES PROPORTIONALLY RECEIVE

01:17:34.016 --> 01:17:37.419
MORE MONEY THAN PER CAPITA THAN

01:17:37.486 --> 01:17:39.454
SMALLER COUNTIES. SO I MENTION

01:17:39.521 --> 01:17:41.256
THAT THERE IS ACTUALLY A

01:17:41.323 --> 01:17:41.890
HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION CARVE OUT

01:17:41.957 --> 01:17:44.626
FOR SMALL COUNTY. AND THAT IS A

01:17:44.693 --> 01:17:46.061
FLOW THAT CREATES A FLOOR THAT

01:17:46.128 --> 01:17:47.729
IS ACTUALLY TWO TIMES HIGHER

01:17:47.796 --> 01:17:48.864
THAN THEY WHAT THEY WOULD

01:17:48.930 --> 01:17:50.599
NORMALLY HAVE RECEIVED IF YOU

01:17:50.665 --> 01:17:51.767
ARE LOOKING JUST OUT OF HER

01:17:51.833 --> 01:17:53.402
POPULATION BASIS UNDERSTANDING

01:17:53.468 --> 01:17:55.203
NEEDS AND SMALL COUNTRIES AND

01:17:55.270 --> 01:17:57.272
CITIES. WITHIN THOSE COUNTIES-

01:17:57.339 --> 01:17:58.407
WAS THE PURPOSE AND THE

01:17:58.473 --> 01:17:59.341
RATIONALE BEHIND HAVING A

01:17:59.408 --> 01:18:00.542
LARGER CAR ABOUT THAT.

01:18:00.609 --> 01:18:03.278
APPRECIATE THAT BUT YOU DID

01:18:03.345 --> 01:18:06.748
REGISTER MY QUESTION- IT COULD.

01:18:06.815 --> 01:18:09.117
BE HARDER TO. POTENTIALLY

01:18:09.184 --> 01:18:11.553
RECEIVE MORE PER CAPITA. THAN

01:18:11.620 --> 01:18:12.821
RESIDENTS OF SMALLER COUNTIES

01:18:12.888 --> 01:18:14.623
THAT WAS MY QUESTION I UNDER I

01:18:14.689 --> 01:18:15.991
UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAID.

01:18:16.058 --> 01:18:17.459
BUT WE SAW THROUGH THE CURES

01:18:17.526 --> 01:18:19.561
ACT THAT SMALLER COUNTIES GOT

01:18:19.628 --> 01:18:22.230
DISPROPORTIONATELY HIT- WHEN IT

01:18:22.297 --> 01:18:24.866
CAME TO COBIT RELIEF SO I'M

01:18:24.933 --> 01:18:27.569
TRYING TO ENSURE THAT. WE GET

01:18:27.636 --> 01:18:29.604
FAIR TREATMENT I REPRESENT FIVE

01:18:29.671 --> 01:18:31.840
COUNTIES THEY'RE ALL LESS THAN

01:18:31.907 --> 01:18:33.742
FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE.

01:18:33.809 --> 01:18:35.010
IN THE WAY I'VE SEEN THIS IS

01:18:35.077 --> 01:18:37.212
THAT IF YOU'RE A BIG COUNTY YOU

01:18:37.279 --> 01:18:38.280
CAN GET MONEY DIRECTLY FROM THE

01:18:38.346 --> 01:18:39.614
FEDERAL TREASURY AND YOU GET

01:18:39.681 --> 01:18:40.615
DIRECT MONIES DIRECTLY

01:18:40.682 --> 01:18:42.317
SOMEWHERE ELSE. BUT I'M A

01:18:42.384 --> 01:18:45.153
SMALLER COUNTY. I HAVE TO GO

01:18:45.220 --> 01:18:47.355
THROUGH ANOTHER PROCESS. THIS

01:18:47.422 --> 01:18:48.657
FEELS LIKE THE COMMUNITY

01:18:48.723 --> 01:18:50.625
DEVELOPMENT BLOCK GRANT WHICH

01:18:50.692 --> 01:18:52.027
HAS BEEN A NIGHTMARE FOR A LOT

01:18:52.094 --> 01:18:54.029
OF PEOPLE MY DISTRICT BECAUSE

01:18:54.096 --> 01:18:55.097
WE DON'T HAVE THE TECHNICAL

01:18:55.163 --> 01:18:56.198
ASSISTANCE TO BE ABLE TO DO

01:18:56.264 --> 01:18:59.067
THESE KINDS OF THINGS SO THIS

01:18:59.134 --> 01:19:00.802
I'M JUST TRYING TO SEE YOU KNOW

01:19:00.869 --> 01:19:02.137
IS IT GOING TO BE FAIR PER

01:19:02.204 --> 01:19:04.539
CAPITA. NUMBER ONE. CROSS THE

01:19:04.606 --> 01:19:05.874
BOARD. BECAUSE THERE'S THAT

01:19:05.941 --> 01:19:07.175
THERE IS A MISCONCEPTION THAT

01:19:07.242 --> 01:19:08.043
PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN SMALLER

01:19:08.110 --> 01:19:10.245
COUNTIES. HAVE LOWER COST OF

01:19:10.312 --> 01:19:11.646
LIVING AND THAT'S A FALLACY

01:19:11.713 --> 01:19:13.181
BECAUSE I CAN TELL YOU IT'S NOT

01:19:13.248 --> 01:19:16.985
TRUE- AND- I JUST WANT TO

01:19:17.052 --> 01:19:19.121
ASSURE. THAT WE'RE NOT GONNA

01:19:19.187 --> 01:19:20.055
END UP IN A SIMILAR SITUATION

01:19:20.122 --> 01:19:22.190
WHERE. WE'RE SHORT CHANGED

01:19:22.257 --> 01:19:23.725
BECAUSE WE OFTEN ARE. THE

01:19:23.792 --> 01:19:24.960
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IN THE

01:19:25.026 --> 01:19:26.294
THINGS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE

01:19:26.361 --> 01:19:27.963
ABILITY TO TAP INTO THIS TO

01:19:28.029 --> 01:19:29.898
MOBILE DEVICES AND INTERNET AND

01:19:29.965 --> 01:19:32.467
ALL THAT. DOESN'T WORK IN A LOT

01:19:32.534 --> 01:19:33.001
OF THE DISPLAY AREA THAT I

01:19:33.068 --> 01:19:34.936
REPRESENT. YOU CAN DRIVE ON THE

01:19:35.003 --> 01:19:36.605
HIGHWAY HIGHWAY ONE OF ONE FROM

01:19:36.671 --> 01:19:38.173
MY HOME TO THE NORTHERN PART OF

01:19:38.240 --> 01:19:40.242
MY DISTRICT IN 50% OF THAT

01:19:40.308 --> 01:19:41.009
HIGHWAY THERE'S NO CELL

01:19:41.076 --> 01:19:42.911
COVERAGE. THERE'S A LOT OF

01:19:42.978 --> 01:19:44.112
PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE INTERNET

01:19:44.179 --> 01:19:46.214
ACCESS WE DON'T HAVE MOBILE.

01:19:46.281 --> 01:19:47.616
AND THEY ARE BEHIND ON THEIR

01:19:47.682 --> 01:19:49.317
RENT OUT THERE HOW WE CAN REACH

01:19:49.384 --> 01:19:53.788
THEM. YES I'M GONNA TURN THE

01:19:53.855 --> 01:19:56.024
QUESTION IN REGARDS TO- PER

01:19:56.091 --> 01:19:58.026
PERSON- ALLOCATION TO

01:19:58.093 --> 01:19:59.427
COLLEAGUES BUT I DO WANT TO SAY

01:19:59.494 --> 01:20:01.062
THAT. AGAIN THE TECHNICAL

01:20:01.129 --> 01:20:03.532
ASSISTANCE WILL BE PROVIDED

01:20:03.598 --> 01:20:06.735
BOTH BY EACH CD TO. AND THAT

01:20:06.801 --> 01:20:08.670
THIRD PARTY IMPLEMENTOR IS BOTH

01:20:08.737 --> 01:20:11.072
A TECHNOLOGICAL AND ALSO-

01:20:11.139 --> 01:20:12.641
WHAT'S ON THE GROUND SO WALKING

01:20:12.707 --> 01:20:14.876
THROUGH COMMUNICATING WITH-

01:20:14.943 --> 01:20:16.545
LANDLORD AND TENANT. ADVOCACY

01:20:16.611 --> 01:20:18.346
GROUPS AND OTHERS ON THE GROUND

01:20:18.413 --> 01:20:20.215
AND IT'S AN ALL NECESSARILY.

01:20:20.282 --> 01:20:21.650
TECHNOLOGICAL SUCH YOUR POINT

01:20:21.716 --> 01:20:24.119
NOT AT NOT ALL POPULATIONS ARE

01:20:24.186 --> 01:20:26.054
EITHER SAUDI ARE COMFORTABLE

01:20:26.121 --> 01:20:26.788
WITH THAT WITH THOSE SETTINGS

01:20:26.855 --> 01:20:28.390
SO ONE I JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT

01:20:28.456 --> 01:20:30.625
THAT AS ONE MEANS OF

01:20:30.692 --> 01:20:31.560
COMMUNICATING THAT INFORMATION

01:20:31.626 --> 01:20:35.497
TO. BIG AND SMALL COUNTIES- AND

01:20:35.564 --> 01:20:39.501
LYNN OR- ANYTHING- ANY OTHER

01:20:39.568 --> 01:20:40.135
DETAILS ON THAT BEFORE YOU DO

01:20:40.202 --> 01:20:42.270
THAT. I JUST LIKE TO SAY FREE

01:20:42.337 --> 01:20:44.139
TO HISTORICALLY THAT EXTRA

01:20:44.206 --> 01:20:45.373
LAYER OF BUREAUCRACY HAS BEEN

01:20:45.440 --> 01:20:46.975
REALLY DIFFICULT FOR SMALLER

01:20:47.042 --> 01:20:50.812
COUNTIES HISTORICALLY. AT HOUSE

01:20:50.879 --> 01:20:52.514
AND SO. A TO A THIRD. THAT WE

01:20:52.581 --> 01:20:54.749
KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THIS POINT

01:20:54.816 --> 01:20:56.785
MAY HAVE GOOD TIES TO KEEP.

01:20:56.851 --> 01:20:59.788
THESE MAY NOT- I DON'T HAVE A

01:20:59.854 --> 01:21:01.523
REAL COMFORTABLE FEELING WITH

01:21:01.590 --> 01:21:03.091
ABOUT SOME OF THIS RIGHT NOW

01:21:03.158 --> 01:21:05.227
AND- YOU KNOW I WANT I'M GONNA

01:21:05.293 --> 01:21:07.295
SUPPORT WHAT WE DO HERE. BUT

01:21:07.362 --> 01:21:09.130
I'M TELLING YOU NOW THAT BASED

01:21:09.197 --> 01:21:10.599
ON MY PAST EXPERIENCE WITH

01:21:10.665 --> 01:21:11.066
THINGS LIKE COMMUNITY

01:21:11.132 --> 01:21:12.434
DEVELOPMENT BLOCK GRANTS IN

01:21:12.500 --> 01:21:14.035
SMALLER COMMUNITIES. I DON'T

01:21:14.102 --> 01:21:15.003
HAVE A WARM AND FUZZY FEELING

01:21:15.070 --> 01:21:17.539
ABOUT THIS SO I'M HOPING THAT

01:21:17.606 --> 01:21:21.776
I'M WRONG- AND- BUT IF I'M NOT.

01:21:21.843 --> 01:21:26.815
YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR ABOUT IT.

01:21:26.881 --> 01:21:29.851
I CAN I CAN- I CAN HELP TO

01:21:29.918 --> 01:21:32.020
ANSWER AND UNDERSTOOD WERE LATE

01:21:32.087 --> 01:21:33.722
TO THE DEAN OF THE POPULATION

01:21:33.788 --> 01:21:35.257
DISTRIBUTION I THINK ONE THING

01:21:35.323 --> 01:21:36.458
THAT'S PRETTY IMPORTANT TO KNOW

01:21:36.524 --> 01:21:38.693
IS THAT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THOSE

01:21:38.760 --> 01:21:40.762
THE POPULATION IN CALIFORNIA

01:21:40.829 --> 01:21:42.564
THAT IS AND- WILL RECEIVE A

01:21:42.631 --> 01:21:44.532
DIRECT FEDERAL ALLOCATION AND

01:21:44.599 --> 01:21:46.701
THAT COMPRISES ABOUT 95% OF THE

01:21:46.768 --> 01:21:48.703
POPULATION. AND SO IF THAT THE

01:21:48.770 --> 01:21:51.039
UNDER TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND I'M

01:21:51.106 --> 01:21:52.841
COMMUNITIES ARE THOSE THAT THE

01:21:52.907 --> 01:21:55.010
MAKE UP 5% OF THE POPULATION

01:21:55.076 --> 01:21:55.977
AND SO IN LOOKING AT THE

01:21:56.044 --> 01:21:58.046
DISTRIBUTION OF THE STATE

01:21:58.113 --> 01:21:59.981
PORTION AND WE SENSUALLY

01:22:00.048 --> 01:22:01.249
DOUBLED UP SO THAT THEY WOULD

01:22:01.316 --> 01:22:02.851
HAVE THE SAME THEY WOULD HAVE

01:22:02.917 --> 01:22:05.620
THE SAME PER CAPITA- FORMULA AS

01:22:05.687 --> 01:22:06.721
THE JURISDICTIONS THAT WERE

01:22:06.788 --> 01:22:07.622
REPEATING THE DIRECT

01:22:07.689 --> 01:22:09.424
APPLICATION AS WELL. AND DO WE

01:22:09.491 --> 01:22:11.159
REALLY DO THINK THAT WE WORKED

01:22:11.226 --> 01:22:12.794
TO CREATE A GEOGRAPHICAL

01:22:12.861 --> 01:22:15.363
POPULATION EQUITY WITHIN-

01:22:15.430 --> 01:22:18.066
WITHIN THAT STRUCTURE AND THE

01:22:18.133 --> 01:22:20.302
OTHER THING THAT AND WE NEEDED

01:22:20.368 --> 01:22:22.437
INCLUDE AND THE LANGUAGE IS

01:22:22.504 --> 01:22:24.239
THAT ORDERED DICTION THAT ARE

01:22:24.306 --> 01:22:26.608
RECEIVING IT AT THAT THAT OFTEN

01:22:26.675 --> 01:22:28.243
FOR A STATE ALLOCATIONS FOR THE

01:22:28.310 --> 01:22:29.711
BLOCK GRANT PROGRAM. THERE IS A

01:22:29.778 --> 01:22:31.346
REQUIREMENT FOR EQUITABLE

01:22:31.413 --> 01:22:33.882
DISTRIBUTION WITH ACROSS THERE

01:22:33.948 --> 01:22:36.117
RIGHT ACROSS THEIR- THEIR

01:22:36.184 --> 01:22:37.686
JURISDICTION AS WELL AND WE

01:22:37.752 --> 01:22:38.987
HOPE THAT I WILL CREATE JUST

01:22:39.054 --> 01:22:40.388
ONE MORE LAYER OF DISTRIBUTION

01:22:40.455 --> 01:22:43.425
BETWEEN- CITIES AND CITIES AND

01:22:43.491 --> 01:22:45.126
UNINCORPORATED AREAS WITHIN

01:22:45.193 --> 01:22:46.361
WITHIN A COUNTY THAT IS

01:22:46.428 --> 01:22:47.629
ELIGIBLE FOR THAT THAT

01:22:47.696 --> 01:22:50.665
RESERVATION. AND THEN AS IT

01:22:50.732 --> 01:22:53.835
RELATES TO- MAKING SURE THAT WE

01:22:53.902 --> 01:22:56.371
HAVE OUR REACH WITHIN- WITHIN

01:22:56.438 --> 01:22:58.640
SMALLER JURISDICTION- THAT'S

01:22:58.707 --> 01:23:00.942
ONE OF THE AREAS THAT WE BEEN

01:23:01.009 --> 01:23:02.310
VISION AT THE THIRD PARTY

01:23:02.377 --> 01:23:05.313
IMPLEMENTOR WOULD BE- REQUIRED

01:23:05.380 --> 01:23:06.915
TO HAVE A STRONG PARTNERSHIP ON

01:23:06.981 --> 01:23:08.917
BOTH IN IN PLACE ALREADY AND

01:23:08.983 --> 01:23:10.218
THEN. NEW PARTNERSHIP WITH

01:23:10.285 --> 01:23:11.319
DOUBTLESS TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:23:11.386 --> 01:23:13.488
THERE WAS A VERY LASER FOCUSED

01:23:13.555 --> 01:23:15.090
ON I'M GETTING THE INFORMATION

01:23:15.156 --> 01:23:16.925
INTO THE HANDS OF- OF

01:23:16.991 --> 01:23:18.059
INDIVIDUALS ALL ACROSS THE

01:23:18.126 --> 01:23:20.028
STATE AND ESPECIALLY IN THE

01:23:20.095 --> 01:23:28.436
AREAS THAT ARE ARE- AT. HARD

01:23:28.503 --> 01:23:29.337
HARDER TO REACH- FOR MANY

01:23:29.404 --> 01:23:30.538
REASONS. SO IT SOUNDS LIKE IF

01:23:30.605 --> 01:23:31.172
YOU HAD THE SAID ASID THE AND

01:23:31.239 --> 01:23:31.906
MILLION FOR THESE CAN. THEY

01:23:31.973 --> 01:23:33.108
WOULDN'T GOTTEN PROPORTION

01:23:33.174 --> 01:23:36.044
MONEY RIGHT. THE WAY IT WAS SET

01:23:36.111 --> 01:23:37.312
UP TO IF YOU HAD TO SET THAT

01:23:37.379 --> 01:23:40.548
ASIDE CONSCIOUSLY. WHAT I

01:23:40.615 --> 01:23:42.250
THOUGHT MIGHT HAPPEN WOULD

01:23:42.317 --> 01:23:45.987
HAPPEN RIGHT. RIGHT BECAUSE OF

01:23:46.054 --> 01:23:47.555
THE ALLOCATION FROM THE FEDERAL

01:23:47.622 --> 01:23:49.090
GOVERNMENT YES BUT I BELIEVE

01:23:49.157 --> 01:23:51.459
THAT WE CORRECTED FOR THAT AT

01:23:51.526 --> 01:23:51.993
THE STATE LEVEL WITHIN THE

01:23:52.060 --> 01:23:58.433
PROGRAM. OKAY THANK YOU. I

01:23:58.500 --> 01:24:00.268

WOODS FOR. HIS COMMENTS AND

01:24:10.678 --> 01:24:13.782
CONCERNS FOR OUR ROLE AREAS I

01:24:13.848 --> 01:24:16.618
SHARE MANY OF THOSE- AND I

01:24:16.684 --> 01:24:18.219
REALLY APPRECIATE THE-

01:24:18.286 --> 01:24:21.656
PROPORTION MEN OR EQUITY

01:24:21.723 --> 01:24:23.958
QUESTION IN ENSURING THAT- WERE

01:24:24.025 --> 01:24:27.362
ABLE TO GET. RESOURCES AND

01:24:27.429 --> 01:24:30.031
FUNDING THERE BECAUSE- YOU KNOW

01:24:30.098 --> 01:24:34.869
THE CONCERN THAT I HAVE. COMES

01:24:34.936 --> 01:24:38.373
INTO THE EFFICIENCY. ON HOW

01:24:38.440 --> 01:24:38.940
THIS PROGRAM IS GOING TO BE

01:24:39.007 --> 01:24:44.512
MEASURED- WE'VE SEEN A AND I

01:24:44.579 --> 01:24:45.113
GET THESE CALLS ALL THE TIME I

01:24:45.180 --> 01:24:48.283
MEAN ARE. THE TWO ONE ONE LINE

01:24:48.349 --> 01:24:49.818
FOR GETTING HELP WITH

01:24:49.884 --> 01:24:51.519
EVERYTHING GOING ON CONTINUES

01:24:51.586 --> 01:24:53.888
TO CRASH. WE'VE SEEN STATE

01:24:53.955 --> 01:24:56.391
WEBSITES FROM DMV EDT EVEN

01:24:56.458 --> 01:24:58.426
DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH

01:24:58.493 --> 01:25:01.563
CONTINUE TO CRASH. AND I HAVE A

01:25:01.629 --> 01:25:03.531
CONCERN THAT AS THIS ROLLS OUT

01:25:03.598 --> 01:25:06.234
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE. EVEN MORE

01:25:06.301 --> 01:25:09.604
OF A PROBLEM KEEPING OUR BASIC

01:25:09.671 --> 01:25:14.442
HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE UP- ME IN

01:25:14.509 --> 01:25:17.612
YET ANOTHER WEBSITE WILL CRASH-

01:25:17.679 --> 01:25:21.449
IT'S NOT. SO IT IS MY FIRST

01:25:21.516 --> 01:25:24.185
QUESTION WOULD BE WHAT IS GOING

01:25:24.252 --> 01:25:28.756
TO BE DONE. TO ENSURE THAT THE

01:25:28.823 --> 01:25:31.759
SYSTEMS DO NOT CRASH LIKE ALL

01:25:31.826 --> 01:25:34.963
THE OTHERS- AS THIS PROGRAM

01:25:35.029 --> 01:25:41.236
ROLLS OUT. CAN I ASK ONE OF MY

01:25:41.302 --> 01:25:41.769
COLLEAGUES FROM AGENCY TO

01:25:41.836 --> 01:25:47.175
RESPOND TO THAT. ABSOLUTELY.

YES THANK I CAN I CAN TAKE THAT

01:25:48.576 --> 01:25:51.579
ERICA AND THAT IS A VERY VERY

01:25:51.646 --> 01:25:53.581
IMPORTANT QUESTION AND IT IS

01:25:53.648 --> 01:25:55.817
SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE AND-

01:25:55.884 --> 01:25:58.219
REALLY RESEARCHING AND MAKING

01:25:58.286 --> 01:25:58.753
SURE THAT WE'RE LEARNING

01:25:58.820 --> 01:26:01.055
LESSONS FROM AND EXPERIENCES

01:26:01.122 --> 01:26:02.590
BOTH WITHIN THE STATE AND

01:26:02.657 --> 01:26:04.592
WITHIN OTHER STATES ACROSS THE

01:26:04.659 --> 01:26:07.061
UNITED STATES. AND WE THINK

01:26:07.128 --> 01:26:11.366
pIS PROVIDE A METRIC WITHIN OUR

01:26:11.432 --> 01:26:13.835
OUR WEBSITE PROGRAM. IT WOULD

01:26:13.902 --> 01:26:15.503
REQUIRE- AT CERTAIN

01:26:15.570 --> 01:26:17.639
REDUNDANCIES- REALLY LEAN ON

01:26:17.705 --> 01:26:18.973
BEING ABLE TO LEAN ON ENACT A

01:26:19.040 --> 01:26:20.808
NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE IN

01:26:20.875 --> 01:26:22.810
TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO HAVE-

01:26:22.877 --> 01:26:25.346
YOU KNOW THE RIGHT BACKBONE- TO

01:26:25.413 --> 01:26:27.348
BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THE USE THAT

01:26:27.415 --> 01:26:28.883
WE CAN IMAGINE IN CALIFORNIA.

01:26:28.950 --> 01:26:30.218
AND THEN I THINK THE OTHER

01:26:30.285 --> 01:26:31.152
THING WE HAVE TO DO IS REALLY

01:26:31.219 --> 01:26:32.654
MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE SETTING UP

01:26:32.720 --> 01:26:34.055
WITH THE- THE APPLICATION

01:26:34.122 --> 01:26:36.591
PROCESS IN A WAY. THAT THAT

01:26:36.658 --> 01:26:39.360
DOES NOT- YOU KNOW LEADERS AND

01:26:39.427 --> 01:26:41.129
AN IMMEDIATE CRASH THE THINGS

01:26:41.195 --> 01:26:42.196
YOU CAN DO FOR EXAMPLE WOULD

01:26:42.263 --> 01:26:44.666
BE- HAVING A FIRST TO GAUGE

LOTS OF THINGS IN LIFE AND THE

01:36:44.632 --> 01:36:46.000
IDEA THAT THEY WILL BE ABLE TO

01:36:46.066 --> 01:36:48.068

THINGS THAT THE BOOTS ON THE

GROUND THAT JUST WHEN THE TIRE

01:36:56.043 --> 01:36:57.711
MEETS THE ROAD THAT'S GOING TO

01:36:57.778 --> 01:36:59.446
BE THE REAL DIFFICULT THING FOR

01:36:59.513 --> 01:37:01.482

01:37:54.301 --> 01:37:55.569
QUESTIONS ABOUT LOOKING THE

01:37:55.636 --> 01:37:57.004
OTHER STATES WHEN IT COMES TO

01:37:57.071 --> 01:37:59.607

NATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS THAT

01:38:31.005 --> 01:38:32.439
HAVE DONE A WONDERFUL JOB OF

01:38:32.506 --> 01:38:34.174
BRINGING ALL THE STATE TOGETHER

01:38:34.241 --> 01:38:36.343
AND TO BE ABLE TO DISCUSS-

01:38:36.410 --> 01:38:38.545

STATE I'M SO THAT'S BEEN ONE OF

01:38:43.284 --> 01:38:44.385
THE PRIMARY RATE THAT WE HAVE

01:38:44.451 --> 01:38:46.086
BEEN CONNECTED- THROUGH

01:38:46.153 --> 01:38:47.321

CONTINUE BECAUSE- YOU KNOW

01:39:10.944 --> 01:39:12.980
QUITE FRANKLY CALIFORNIA HAS

01:39:13.047 --> 01:39:14.915
NOT PERFORMED WELL. IN MANY

01:39:14.982 --> 01:39:17.017
DIMENSIONS OF THIS COVERT

01:39:17.084 --> 01:39:18.852
RESPONSE COMPARED TO OTHER

01:39:18.919 --> 01:39:20.254
STATES IN THE COUNTRY I HAVE A

01:39:20.321 --> 01:39:21.655
QUOTE HERE FROM SENATOR SCOTT

01:39:21.722 --> 01:39:23.457
WIENER OF SAN FRANCISCO. WHO

01:39:23.524 --> 01:39:25.959
SAYS I AM CONCERNED ABOUT

01:39:26.026 --> 01:39:27.328
ADMINISTRATIVE ROLE OUT OF RENT

01:39:27.394 --> 01:39:28.829
RELIEF GIVEN CALIFORNIA'S

01:39:28.896 --> 01:39:30.230
LOGISTICAL PROBLEMS DURING THE

01:39:30.297 --> 01:39:31.598
PANDEMIC PANDEMIC WITH THINGS

01:39:31.665 --> 01:39:33.967
LIKE UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS. AND

01:39:34.034 --> 01:39:35.169
VACCINES AND OF COURSE WE COULD

01:39:35.235 --> 01:39:35.869
HAVE ADDED A WHOLE HOST OF

01:39:35.936 --> 01:39:37.538
OTHER THINGS WERE CALIFORNIA

01:39:37.604 --> 01:39:38.839
HAS BEEN AMONG THE WORST STATES

01:39:38.906 --> 01:39:40.674
IN THE COUNTRY SO. YOU KNOW

01:39:40.741 --> 01:39:42.276
AND- WE SAW FOR EXAMPLE WITH

01:39:42.343 --> 01:39:44.244
THE EDT FRAUD ISSUE THE DA'S

01:39:44.311 --> 01:39:45.179
THERE SO JUST LOOK WHAT OTHER

01:39:45.245 --> 01:39:46.347
STATES ARE DOING. THEY FIGURED

01:39:46.413 --> 01:39:48.248
OUT SO I JUST HEARD THE

01:39:48.315 --> 01:39:50.951
ADMINISTRATION. JUST TO LOOK AT

01:39:51.018 --> 01:39:51.552
STATES THAT HAVE DONE A GOOD

01:39:51.618 --> 01:39:53.253
JOB WITH THINGS LIKE THIS AND

01:39:53.320 --> 01:39:54.121
COPY WHAT THEY'RE DOING

01:39:54.188 --> 01:39:56.590
BECAUSE- YOU KNOW IF OUR OWN

01:39:56.657 --> 01:39:57.691
SOLUTIONS ENDED UP WORKING OUT

01:39:57.758 --> 01:40:00.060
WELL. ON THIS ISSUE WOULD BE A

01:40:00.127 --> 01:40:01.528
DRAMATIC BREAK FROM PRECEDENT

01:40:01.595 --> 01:40:03.597
WITH ALL OF THE OTHER ISSUES.

01:40:03.664 --> 01:40:05.499
THAT WE FACED RECENTLY. SECOND

01:40:05.566 --> 01:40:08.235
POINT I WANT TO MAKE IS THAT-

01:40:08.302 --> 01:40:09.470
YOU KNOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:40:09.536 --> 01:40:11.238
RIGHT RELIEF WHICH A LOT OF

01:40:11.305 --> 01:40:13.307
FOLKS. ABSOLUTELY NEED. BUT

01:40:13.374 --> 01:40:14.375
WHEN YOU REALLY TALK TO PEOPLE

01:40:14.441 --> 01:40:15.242
WHAT THEY WANTED THEY WANTED

01:40:15.309 --> 01:40:17.344
NOT NECESSARILY RELIEF FROM THE

01:40:17.411 --> 01:40:18.879
GOVERNMENT THEY WANT TO BE ABLE

01:40:18.946 --> 01:40:20.681
TO EARN A PAYCHECK AGAIN. AND

01:40:20.748 --> 01:40:22.483
CALIFORNIA HAS HAD THE MOST

01:40:22.549 --> 01:40:25.386
STRINGENT RESTRICTIONS ON WORK

01:40:25.452 --> 01:40:27.454
OF ANY STATE. IN THE COUNTRY.

01:40:27.521 --> 01:40:28.956
AND BY THE WAY THAT EXISTED

01:40:29.022 --> 01:40:31.091
EVEN BEFORE- THE LOCKDOWNS

01:40:31.158 --> 01:40:32.426
WE'VE THE ONLY STATE IN THE

01:40:32.493 --> 01:40:34.161
BAND INDEPENDENT CONTRACTING.

01:40:34.228 --> 01:40:35.295
FOR EXAMPLE AND ON TOP OF ALL

01:40:35.362 --> 01:40:36.430
THAT WE'RE NOT GETTING PEOPLE

01:40:36.497 --> 01:40:37.297
THE UNEMPLOYMENT CHECKS THAT

01:40:37.364 --> 01:40:38.632
THEY NEED. AT LEAST WITH

01:40:38.699 --> 01:40:39.533
RESPECT TO THE LATTER THE

01:40:39.600 --> 01:40:41.335
LEGISLATURE'S PROVIDED SOME

01:40:41.402 --> 01:40:43.237
MODICUM OF OVERSIGHT BUT IT

01:40:43.303 --> 01:40:44.238
HASN'T SOLVED ANY OF THE

01:40:44.304 --> 01:40:45.205
PROBLEMS THE BACKLOG IS ABOUT

01:40:45.272 --> 01:40:47.841
AS- LARGE AS HAVE BEEN. AND SO

01:40:47.908 --> 01:40:50.077
I WOULD JUST- ENCOURAGE THIS

01:48:39.846 --> 01:48:43.016
AREAS- THIRTY COUNTIES ARE LESS

01:48:43.083 --> 01:48:44.718
THAN TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND IN

01:48:44.784 --> 01:48:45.819
POPULATION THIRTY OF OUR FIFTY

01:48:45.886 --> 01:48:49.289
EIGHT COUNTIES- I'M LOOKING AT

01:48:49.356 --> 01:48:50.523

THIS IS ONE PROGRAM

01:48:56.696 --> 01:48:58.865
IMPLEMENTER. HOW DO YOU DO YOU

01:48:58.932 --> 01:49:00.467
ARE THERE OTHER PROGRAM INTO

IMPLEMENTERS THAT WORK

01:49:01.134 --> 01:49:05.472
DIRECTLY. IS THIS ALL. BIG

01:49:05.538 --> 01:49:07.140
PROGRAM IMPLEMENTOR GOING TO BE

01:49:07.207 --> 01:49:08.308
ABLE TO HAVE ALL THESE

01:49:08.375 --> 01:49:09.376
RELATIONSHIPS YOU'RE TALKING

01:49:09.442 --> 01:49:10.977
ABOUT OR ARE THERE OTHER

PROGRAM IMPLEMENTERS IT WILL BE

01:49:13.179 --> 01:49:14.614
WORKING AND OTHER KEY AND IN

01:49:14.681 --> 01:49:23.957
SMALLER COUNTIES. YES

01:49:24.024 --> 01:49:26.059
ABSOLUTELY SO THE WAY THAT

01:49:26.126 --> 01:49:27.594
ENVISIONED ABOUT THE THAT

01:49:27.661 --> 01:49:28.228
HOUSING AND COMMUNITY

01:49:28.295 --> 01:49:29.596
DEVELOPMENT WOULD HAVE ONE

01:49:29.663 --> 01:49:30.830
CENTRAL CONTRACT WITH THE

01:49:30.897 --> 01:49:32.766
PROGRAM IMPLEMENTER AND THEN

01:49:32.832 --> 01:49:34.067
THAT PROGRAM IMPLEMENTER WOULD

01:49:34.134 --> 01:49:37.671
WORK WITH. NUMBER OF LOCAL DAY

01:49:37.737 --> 01:49:38.738
PARTNER THAT WOULD PROVIDE

01:49:38.805 --> 01:49:41.308
VARIOUS LEVELS OF SUPPORT AND

01:49:41.374 --> 01:49:42.609
CHANGE YOU INTO THEIR

01:49:42.676 --> 01:49:45.445
COMMUNITIES DIRECTLY- THE IDEA

01:49:45.512 --> 01:49:47.213
BEING THAT THE AD THE

01:49:47.280 --> 01:49:49.082
DECENTRALIZATION IS REALLY

01:49:49.149 --> 01:49:51.051
IMPORTANT FOR COMMUNICATION OUR

01:49:51.117 --> 01:49:52.585
REGION TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE.

01:49:52.652 --> 01:49:54.187
BUT THAT THE UNIFICATION OF THE

01:49:54.254 --> 01:49:55.989
APPLICATION MATERIAL INSIDE OF

01:49:56.056 --> 01:49:58.491
THE- THE CENTRAL PORTAL IS WHAT

01:49:58.558 --> 01:50:00.460
ALLOWS US TO BE ABLE TO MANAGE

01:50:00.527 --> 01:50:02.762
THAT THAT THE CONTENT AND THAT

01:50:02.829 --> 01:50:03.964
THE PROGRAM RESOURCES IN A WAY

01:50:04.030 --> 01:50:05.732
THAT THE MOST EFFECTIVE. THOUGH

01:50:05.799 --> 01:50:07.467
YES THERE WOULD BE THERE WOULD

01:50:07.534 --> 01:50:10.437
BE A NUMBER OF- I DIRECT DIRECT

01:50:10.503 --> 01:50:12.706
PROGRAM. PROVIDES PARTNERSHIP

01:50:12.772 --> 01:50:14.107
THAT WOULD BE LOCATED

01:50:14.174 --> 01:50:15.575
THROUGHOUT THE STATE BUT THEN

01:50:15.642 --> 01:50:20.413
THEY WOULD LINK. UP TO THE

01:50:20.480 --> 01:50:21.381
CENTRAL IMPLEMENTOR. SO-

01:50:21.448 --> 01:50:23.583
LOGISTICALLY I OUT I DO I DON'T

01:50:23.650 --> 01:50:24.851
JUST AN IBM I'M NOT SURE TO BE

01:50:24.918 --> 01:50:26.086
TO I'M REALLY NOT A NEVER GONNA

01:50:26.152 --> 01:50:27.520
APOLOGIZE BEING PASS. IN MICE.

01:50:27.587 --> 01:50:29.456
OF MY CONSTITUENTS FOR THE FIVE

01:50:29.522 --> 01:50:30.523
COUNTIES ARE REPRESENTED LESS

01:50:30.590 --> 01:50:31.825
THAN TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND

01:50:31.891 --> 01:50:34.361
PEOPLE. AND AND I AND I DO HAVE

01:50:34.427 --> 01:50:38.098
CONCERNS I JUST I JUST. WORRY

01:50:38.164 --> 01:50:39.866
THAT. WE'RE GONNA BE

01:50:39.933 --> 01:50:41.634
POTENTIALLY YOU KNOW NOT NOT

01:50:41.701 --> 01:50:44.037
SEE THAT- SEEM TO SEE THE SAME

01:50:44.104 --> 01:50:47.107
SUCCESS. BECAUSE EVERY TO

01:50:47.173 --> 01:50:48.241
WONDER ABOUT THE METRICS AND

01:50:48.308 --> 01:50:49.642
HOW THE METRICS WILL FLOW AND I

01:50:49.709 --> 01:50:51.444
HOPE THAT AS WE START GETTING

01:50:51.511 --> 01:50:53.513
INFORMATION BACK THAT IT WILL

01:50:53.580 --> 01:50:55.048
ALSO BE ON A COUNTY BY COUNTY

01:50:55.115 --> 01:50:56.282
BASIS SO WE CAN REALLY JUDGE

01:50:56.349 --> 01:50:58.985
THE SUCCESS. OF WHAT'S GOING ON

01:50:59.052 --> 01:51:01.554
BECAUSE FOR EXAMPLE YOU KNOW

01:51:01.621 --> 01:51:02.622
95% OF PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA

01:51:02.689 --> 01:51:04.724
HAVE INTERNET ACCESS WHAT WHAT

01:51:04.791 --> 01:51:05.692
THAT DOESN'T TELL YOU IS THAT'S

01:51:05.759 --> 01:51:08.461
NOT 95% IN EVERY COUNTY THAT'S

01:51:08.528 --> 01:51:10.563
95% STATEWIDE. AND WHAT THAT

01:51:10.630 --> 01:51:12.565
MEANS IS THAT OFTEN SMALLER

01:51:12.632 --> 01:51:14.734
COUNTIES ARE RURAL COUNTIES ARE

01:51:14.801 --> 01:51:15.769
THE ONES THAT ARE JUST

01:51:15.835 --> 01:51:17.871
PROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED AND SO

01:51:17.937 --> 01:51:19.172
I HOPE THAT THE METRICS THEY

01:51:19.239 --> 01:51:20.807
WERE LOOKING AT. ARE GOING TO

01:51:20.874 --> 01:51:23.143
BE SUCCESSFUL FOR. THE HIGH

01:51:23.209 --> 01:51:25.111
PERCENTAGE IN EVERY COUNTY AND

01:51:25.178 --> 01:51:27.080
NOT JUST THAT 95% NUMBER

01:51:27.147 --> 01:51:30.950
BECAUSE IF IT IS. WE LIVES AND

01:51:31.017 --> 01:51:31.551
I AND I AND THAT'S THAT'S JUST

01:51:31.618 --> 01:51:34.954
NOT FAIR. IT IF I MAY FOLLOW UP

01:51:35.021 --> 01:51:36.923
AND MAYBE I CAN EXPLAIN ONE

01:51:36.990 --> 01:51:37.957
OTHER THING THAT I THINK MAYBE

01:51:38.024 --> 01:51:39.225
WILL HELP ALLEVIATE SOME OF

01:51:39.292 --> 01:51:41.728
THAT CONCERN. AND THE WAY THAT

01:51:41.795 --> 01:51:43.730
IT'S BEEN VISION WITHIN THE-

01:51:43.797 --> 01:51:45.632
THAT THAT 5% IS THAT THERE

01:51:45.698 --> 01:51:48.001
WOULD BE A RESERVATION FOR EACH

01:51:48.068 --> 01:51:50.804
COUNTY. ON THAT UNDER TWO

01:51:50.870 --> 01:51:51.805
HUNDRED THOUSAND AND SO AND- AS

01:51:51.871 --> 01:51:52.605
WE'RE LOOKING AT BOTH

01:51:52.672 --> 01:51:54.374
DISTRIBUTION OF RESOURCES AND

01:51:54.441 --> 01:51:55.742
THEN THE COMMUNICATION OUR

01:51:55.809 --> 01:51:57.410
REGION TECHNICAL. GEN IT WILL

01:51:57.477 --> 01:51:59.712
ALL BE TO BE ABLE TO EXPAND

01:51:59.779 --> 01:52:01.748
RESOURCES- THAT ALLOCATE THAT

01:52:01.815 --> 01:52:03.550
RESERVATION TABLE. UNTIL EACH

01:52:03.616 --> 01:52:05.218
JURISDICTION WILL WILL BE

01:52:05.285 --> 01:52:07.320
MONITORING FOR EXPENDITURE

01:52:07.387 --> 01:52:12.125
REYES. AND TARGETING SPENDING.

01:52:12.192 --> 01:52:12.692
TO THAT TO THAT POINT. OUR

01:52:12.759 --> 01:52:13.726
THERE HOLD BACK FRIEDMAN IS TO

01:52:13.793 --> 01:52:15.261
THE STATE ON THAT WERE THAT IS

01:52:15.328 --> 01:52:16.096
FOR THE IS THAT MONEY JUST

01:52:16.162 --> 01:52:18.031
GOING TO BE THAT ENTIRE AMOUNT

01:52:18.098 --> 01:52:19.532
GOING TO BE GOING OUT. IN OTHER

01:52:19.599 --> 01:52:20.834
WORDS IS THERE A MIDDLE IS

01:52:20.900 --> 01:52:22.135
THERE SORT OF A MIDDLE MAN

01:52:22.202 --> 01:52:25.004
ADMINISTRATIVE FEE. THAT MEANS

01:52:25.071 --> 01:52:25.505
THAT THE COUNTIES DON'T

01:52:25.572 --> 01:52:27.841
ESSENTIALLY GET ALL OF THAT

01:52:27.907 --> 01:52:30.643
HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS.

01:52:30.710 --> 01:52:33.012
THURMOND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS

01:52:33.079 --> 01:52:34.214
TO BEING ABLE TO RENOUNCE THE

01:52:34.280 --> 01:52:36.749
PROGRAM- THAT- WE THINK THAT BY

01:52:36.816 --> 01:52:38.184
DOING IT MORE CENTRALLY LOCATED

01:52:38.251 --> 01:52:39.752
WE CAN FIND THE LAST. TIME

01:52:39.819 --> 01:52:41.588
BRITAIN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

01:52:41.654 --> 01:52:44.791
ALLOW FOR. SO IT COULD BE UP TO

01:52:44.858 --> 01:52:47.393
TEN PERCENT. THAT OF THAT

01:52:47.460 --> 01:52:48.228
HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS

01:52:48.294 --> 01:52:50.363
THAT DOESN'T REALLY GO TO THOSE

01:52:50.430 --> 01:52:50.930
COUNTIES IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE

01:52:50.997 --> 01:52:53.700
SAYING. THAT IS AVAILABLE

THROUGH THE FEDERAL PROGRAM BUT

01:52:55.101 --> 01:52:56.936
IT IS NOT WHAT WE ENVISION THE

01:52:57.003 --> 01:52:58.771
COST STRUCTURE WITH AND I THINK.

01:52:58.838 --> 01:52:59.706
BUT IF YOU'RE LARGER COUNTY

01:52:59.772 --> 01:53:01.040
WHICH YOU WOULD NEVER MIND I

01:53:01.107 --> 01:53:02.842
THINK YOU SEE MY POINT. IT'S A

01:53:02.909 --> 01:53:04.244
DIRECT ALLOCATION TO LARGER

01:53:04.310 --> 01:53:06.513
COUNTIES BUT- SMALLER COUNTIES

01:53:06.579 --> 01:53:07.647
THAT ARE GOING TO HAVE A HARDER

01:53:07.714 --> 01:53:10.250
TIME. MAKE MAY LOSE. UP 210% OF

01:53:10.316 --> 01:53:11.751
HOPE DOESN'T HAPPEN BUT THAT'S

01:53:11.818 --> 01:53:14.320
