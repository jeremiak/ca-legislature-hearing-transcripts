WITH OUR WITH OUR COMMITTEE HEARING TODAY EVERYBODY- WELCOME GOOD MORNING- THIS IS- THE STATE SENATE. ENERGY UTILITIES AND COMMUNICATIONS COMMITTEE WELCOME EVERYBODY- THIS IS A CONTINUATION OF A HEARING THAT WE HAD IN NOVEMBER IT IN RESPONSE TO INCIDENTS- IN OCTOBER OF LAST YEAR- IN WHICH- THREE OF THE LARGEST- STATE. OWNED ELECTRIC UTILITIES A SHUT OFF ELECTRICITY- AND POWER TO MILLIONS OF CUSTOMERS IN CALIFORNIA. THE MAJORITY OF WHICH WERE IN THE ERA SERVICE AREA OF PGA ANY. IN ADDITION TO LOSING ELECTRICITY MANY CALIFORNIANS ALSO LOST TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES DURING THE POWERSHOT OFFICE FOR CALIFORNIANS. IN THE EVACUATION ZONE OF THE- CAM K&lt;c.cyan&gt; FIRES&lt;/c&gt; SPECIFICALLY THE LOSS OF THESE SERVICES MAY HAVE LIMITED THEIR ABILITY TO RECEIVE EMERGENCY WARNINGS ABOUT THE FIRE AND EVACUATION ROUTES PHONE AND INTERNET OUTAGES WERE NOT CONFIRMED WERE NOT CONFINED TO AREAS WHERE POWER WAS SHUT OFF. EVEN IN SITUATIONS WHERE CALIFORNIA'S CALIFORNIANS WERE PREPARED TO LOSE POWER MANY CONSUMERS WERE UNPREPARED TO LOSE PHONE AND INTERNET SERVICES. POWER SHOPS ARE NOT THE ONLY CAUSE OF TELECOMMUNICATION OUTAGES A NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING ACCIDENTS COMPUTER FAILURES AND POORLY MAINTAINED INFRASTRUCTURE ALSO CAUSED OUTAGES. TELECOMMUNICATIONS OUTAGES ARE NOT NEW BUT RECENT PHONE AND INTERNET OUTAGES HAVE HIGHLIGHTED THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH LOSING THESE ESSENTIAL SERVICES ESPECIALLY DURING TIMES OF URGENT NEED THIS HEARING IS INTENDED TO CONTINUE TO EXPLORE THE CAUSES OF TELECOMMUNICATION OUTAGES. THE LESSONS THAT WERE LEARNED FROM THE RECENT OUTRAGEOUS AND WHAT WE CAN DO TO ENSURE THE CALIFORNIANS HAVE A RELIABLE TELECOMMUNICATIONS AT WORK. TODAY'S HEARING IS AGAIN A CONTINUATION OF WHAT WE STARTED IN NOVEMBER BUT SPECIFICALLY WILL BE LOOKING MORE. INTO THE TELECOMMUNICATION ASPECT OF THIS INCIDENT. THIS HEARING IS AS SCHEDULED- TO LAST APPROXIMATELY THREE HOURS WITH PUBLIC COMMENT AND WE HAVE A PRETTY PACKED AGENDA. SO WHERE WE'RE GONNA ASK- MEMBERS TO REALLY FOCUS ON ON WHAT. AREAS THEY WOULD LIKE TO- DEALT AND FURTHER IN THE IN THE. WITH WITH WITH HOPE THAT WE CAN REALLY AT A HIGHLIGHT THE MOST IMPORTANT AREAS THAT ARE OF CONCERN TO NOT ONLY US BUT OF THE PUBLIC. WE HAVE TRIED TO DO OUR BEST OF COURSE YOU KNOW THE THREE HOUR HEARING INCLUDES QUITE A BIT OF TESTIMONY AND WE TRY TO DO OUR BEST TO INCLUDE. A VERY DIVERSE GROUP OF VOICES AND REPRESENTATION FOR THOSE AFFECTED. AND IN MANY CASES WILL- THIS WILL BE THE VERY FIRST TIME THIS COMMITTEE. HAS BE HEARING FROM THE TECH TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROVIDERS DIRECTLY FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME. WE KNOW. THAT THIS- HEARING WILL NOT COVER. EVERY SINGLE ISSUE OF COURSE- THERE THERE'S QUITE A BIT THE PEOPLE LIKE TO HEAR FROM BUT- WE WILL BE- TAKE TAKING A LOT OF THOSE ISSUES THAT ARE NOT ONLY NOT HER TUTOR BUT REYES TODAY ES. INTO CONSIDERATION IN IN FUTURE HEARINGS AND FUTURE OF MATTERS THAT WE MAY HAVE. WHAT THE SAID I WANT TO WELCOME OUR FIRST PANELIST FROM THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. WE HAVE. HELEN WE HAVE. SORRY ABOUT THAT. WE HAVE HELL IN MY COULD MAKE WHICH IS- ASSISTANT GENERAL COUNSEL WE HAVE CLICK CLIFF. WRECK WRECKED CHAFFIN IT LOSES THE COMMISSIONER AND WE HAVE MARIBEL BADGER THE PRESIDENT FOR THE PC WELCOME THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. SO SORRY ABOUT THAT AFTER MY CONFERENCE. I'M FIRST CELL I WILL START MORNING KEREN WEST SO. AND SENATORS AND THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME HERE TO SPEAK TODAY MY NAME IS HELEN MISCARRIAGE I'M AN ASSISTANT GENERAL COUNSEL OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION WHERE I HAVE WORKED FOR THIRTY THREE YEARS. MOSTLY IN THE AREA OF COMMUNICATIONS I'VE BEEN ASKED TO SET THE COMMUNICATION STAGE FOR YOU TODAY. NOT THAT LONG AGO CONSUMERS HAD TRADITIONAL VOICE SERVICE PROVIDED OVER LAND LINES MY EIGHTEEN T. WHICH LATER BECAME. RATHER PACIFIC BELL OFFICIALLY BECAME EIGHTEEN T. AND GT CALIFORNIA WHICH LATER BECAME VERIZON AND A HOST OF SMALLER TELEPHONE COMPANIES ALSO PROVIDED THE SERVICE. MOBILE SERVICE WAS THE NEW TECHNOLOGY AND VOICE OVER INTERNET PROTOCOL WHICH ALLOWS A USER TO MAKE VOICE CALLS USING A BROADBAND INTERNET CONNECTION DID NOT EVEN EXIST. THE LANDSCAPE TODAY IS DRAMATICALLY DIFFERENT. WHILE MANY CUSTOMERS STILL HAVE TRADITIONAL PHONE SERVICE IN CALIFORNIA V. O. I. P. HAS BECOME THE DOMINANT WIRELINE SERVICE IN MILLIONS OF CUSTOMERS HAD OPTED FOR WIRELESS. TEN YEARS AGO THE FCC ADOPTED A NATIONAL BROADBAND PLAN. WHICH ENVISIONED TRANSITIONING THE NATION'S ENTIRE COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK TWO ONE IT IS INTERNET BASED. THAT TRANSITION DRIVEN BY CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY WHICH WERE ALREADY UNDER WAY. HAS CREATED ARTIFICIAL DISTINCTIONS AND HOW WE REGULATE DIFFERENT SERVICES AND TECHNOLOGIES. TO GIVE YOU SOME BASICS TELECOMMUNICATIONS MEANS SIMPLY THE TRANSMISSION OF INFORMATION FROM ONE POINT TO ANOTHER. HISTORICALLY THE CPUC HAS REGULATED VOICE AND DATA SERVICES BECAUSE BOTH INVOLVED TRANSMITTING INFORMATION FROM ONE CUSTOMER TO ANOTHER. THE NETWORK USED TO TRANSMIT THIS INFORMATION IS MADE UP OF FIBER OPTIC LINES COPPER WIRE REMOTE TERMINALS BACK CALL TRUNKS GENERATORS AND OTHER EQUIPMENT THAT WE REFER TO AS FACILITIES. OVER TIME YOU SERVICES WERE DEVELOPED IN THOSE TO USE THE SAME FACILITIES FOR EXAMPLE VOIP SERVICE AND BROADBAND SERVICE CAN BE PROVIDED OVER THE COPPER WIRES THAT MADE UP THE ORIGINAL VOICE TELEPHONE NETWORK. CONVERSELY TRADITIONAL TELEPHONE SERVICE CAN BE PROVIDED OVER FIBER OPTIC LINES. FURTHER EXCEPT FOR THE PORTION TRANSMISSION FROM A CELL TOWER TO YOUR MOBILE PHONE WIRELESS SERVICE ALSO IS PROVIDED ON THE SAME FACILITIES JUST WIRELESS NETWORK. WHEN WE REFER TO A SERVICE AS A SUIT FUTURE SERVICE FOR- ESSENTIALLY SPACE WE SIMPLY MEAN THAT THE PROVIDER CONTROLS ARE OPERATE YOU QUIT MEN OVER WHICH THE TRANSMISSION TRAVELS. TO PROVIDE TO ME ONLY FACILITIES OR LEASE THEM ARE THE WAY TO PROVIDERS RESPONSIBLE FOR THOSE FACILITIES. THE CBC'S ABILITY TO REGULATE SPECIFIC SERVICES IS DICTATED BY STATE AND FEDERAL LAW AND CALIFORNIA'S SHARES WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AUTHORITY TO REGULATE COMMUNICATION SERVICES AND PROVIDERS. CALIFORNIA LAW HISTORICALLY WAS TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL. MEANING STATE LAWS APPLY TO ALL SERVICES TRANSMITTING INFORMATION OVER COMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES WHETHER THOSE SERVICES WERE USING WIRES OR WIRELESS. SECTION TWO THIRTY THREE OF THE PUBLIC UTILITIES CODE SPECIFICALLY STATES THAT A TELEPHONE LINE DEFINED IT STATUTE INCLUDES ALL FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT. USED TO PROVIDE TELEPHONE SERVICE QUOTE WITH OR WITHOUT THE USE OF TRANSMISSION WIRES. UNDER STATE LAW THE PC REGULATED ALL ASPECTS OF TRADITIONAL TELEPHONE SERVICE AND- WIRELESS SERVICES WELL. AS COMPETITION BEGAN ON FULL BEGINNING IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES THE CPC RESPONDED BY CHANGING THE WAY IT REGULATED TRADITIONAL PHONE SERVICE ELIMINATING PRICE REGULATIONS AND ALLOWING PROVIDERS REPLACE TERRACE WITH CUSTOMER SERVICE AGREEMENTS. IN NINETEEN NINETY THREE A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN FEDERAL LAW LIMITED HOW STATE'S CAN REGULATE WIRELESS SERVICE EVEN THOUGH CALIFORNIA LAW PUTS WIRELESS SERVICE UNDER PC JURISDICTION. THE LEGISLATION CONGRESS ENACTED CONSTRAINED STATE AUTHORITY BY PROHIBITING STATES FROM REGULATING WIRELESS RATES AND ENTRY INTO THE MARKET. THAT SAME STATUE HOWEVER RESERVE TO THE STATE TO THIRTY TO REGULATE QUOTE OTHER TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF WIRELESS SERVICE. WIRELESS SERVICE FIRST CAME ALONG IN CALIFORNIA THE PC DEEMED WIRELESS PROVIDERS TO BE TELEPHONE CORPORATIONS UNDER FEDERAL LAW JUST AS TRADITIONAL WIRELINE COMPANIES WERE. THAT'S UNDER SECTION TWO THIRTY FOUR THE PUBLIC UTILITIES CODE IN THE PC IMPOSE ON THEM ALL THE RIGHTS DUTIES AND OBLIGATIONS OF OTHER CPUC LICENSEES. IN A DECISION THE UC ISSUED IMPLEMENTING THAT CHANGE IN FEDERAL LAW IN NINETEEN NINETY THREE THE COMMISSION REQUIRED WIRELESS PROVIDERS TO PAINT A WIRELESS REGISTRATION OR WHAT WE CALL W. LINE OUR NUMBER. IN TWO THOUSAND SIX WATCH TO EXPANDING COMPETITION IN THE VIDEO MARKET THE LEGISLATURE ENACTED THE DIGITAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND VIDEO COMPETITION ACT OR GIVE CA. WHICH GAVE LICENSING AUTHORITY. OVER VIDEO COMPANIES TO THE CPC BUT AFFORDED THE COMMISSION LITTLE OVERSIGHT OF THE SERVICE OTHER THAN A SIMPLIFIED LICENSE REVIEW PROCESS EACH FRANCHISE THE COMPS CPC ISSUES UNDER DIFFICULT FOR TEN YEARS. AND THE RENEWAL PROCESS DOES NOT ALLOW THE COMMISSION TO REVIEW THE FRANCHISE SHE'S PERFORMANCE AT ANY POINT. IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN LEGISLATURE ENACTED SECTION. EXCUSE ME AND ACTED SB ELEVEN SIXTY ONE WHICH PUT INTO THE PUBLIC UTILITIES CODE SECTION SEVEN TEN. THAT SECTIONS SEVERELY RESTRICTED THE COMMISSION'S ABILITY TO REGULATE VOICE OVER INTERNET PROTOCOL SERVICE AS WELL AS IP ENABLE SERVICES. THE STATUE DID CONTAIN AN EXCEPTION FOR BACKUP POWER. BUT THAT. EXCEPTION LIMITED THE P. UC'S AUTHORITY TO WHAT HE DID ADOPTED IN A DECISION ISSUED IN TWO TOP TWO THOUSAND TEN AND THAT DECISION JUST CONCERNED PROVIDING NOTICE TO CUSTOMERS. FINALLY A PROTRACTED BATTLE OF TEN YEARS THE FCC DETERMINED IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THAT BROADBAND SERVICE SHOULD BE EXEMPT FROM ALL STATE REGULATION EVEN THOUGH BROADBAND SERVICE ALSO TRAVELS OVER THE SAME FACILITIES AS TRADITIONAL PHONE SERVICE. AND WIRELESS SERVICE AND PROVIDES ESSENTIAL ACCESS TO NECESSARY SERVICES SUCH AS NINE ONE ONE. THE ENERGY IS ATION MAPS AND EVACUATION INFORMATION. SEVERAL PARTIES INCLUDING THE CPUC CHALLENGE THE FCC'S DECISION TO PREEMPT STATES FROM REGULATING BROADBAND SERVICE IN FACT THE CPC WAS THE ONLY SATE COMMISSION. THE UNITED STATES THAT CHALLENGE THAT DECISION. IN A DECISION ISSUED OCTOBER FIRST OF LAST YEAR THE DC CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS REVERSED THAT PART OF THE FCC'S ORDER WHICH PREEMPTED THE STATE'S. NONE OF THE INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS HAVE FILED FOR THE REPEAL OF THE DC CIRCUIT'S DECISION. IT IS STILL UNCLEAR THAT MEANS. SECTION SEVEN TEN HAS SUNSET AS OF EIGHT DAYS AGO LEAVING OPEN THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE PC TO EXERCISE ITS AUTHORITY TO ENSURE THE NINE ONE ONE SERVICES AVAILABLE THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND ACTUALLY DELIVERED EVEN IN TIMES OF DISASTERS ALTHOUGH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES HAS RESPONSIBILITY TO IMPLEMENT THE NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM- YES DOES NOT HAVE JURISDICTION OVER THE ENTITIES TO CARRY THE NINE ONE ONE TRAFFIC TRANSMITTING THE EMERGENCY CALL FROM A DISTRAUGHT CONSUMER TO THE DISPATCH CENTER. AND BURKE FROM THERE TO THE RELEVANT FIRST RESPONDER. THAT AUTHORITY FALL SQUARELY UNDER THE CPC. AS YOU'LL HEAR FROM PRESIDENT BASHER AND COMMISSION RUPTURE OFTEN MANY SYSTEM FAILURES REQUIRE THE ABILITIES OF BOTH THE OP THE C. P. U. C. M. O. YES TO REMEDY. SO THAT'S THAT'S MY SETTING OF THE STAGE. THAT DONE I WILL. COMMISSION RUSSIA FROM WILL GO ON TO DISCUSS THE COMMISSION EXISTING SERVICE QUALITY RULES FOR THE PC AS WELL AS THE RECENT NETWORK STUDY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU CENTER HUESO CENTERS A PLEASURE TO BE HERE. AS HELEN MENTIONED I WILL TALK ABOUT OUR EXISTING SERVICE QUALITY RULES AND OUR NETWORK EXAMINATION. OR EXISTING SERVICE QUALITY RULES REQUIRE TELEPHONE COMPANIES. TO REPORT ON THREE MAIN SERVICE QUALITY METRICS CUSTOMER TROUBLE REPORTS CUSTOMER SERVICE ANSWER TIME. IN THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT CUSTOMERS ARE OUT OF SERVICE BUT- THESE RULES APPLY TO THE TRADITIONAL VOICE TELEPHONE SERVICE PROVIDED BY COMPANIES LIKE EIGHTEEN T. TEN FRONTIER. THEY DO NOT HOWEVER APPLY TO WIRELESS VOICE CABLE VIDEO OR INTERNET OUTAGES. THE OUT OF SERVICE MEASURES VERY IMPORTANT IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT INDICATOR FOR PUBLIC SAFETY IT MEASURES THE ABILITY OF THE PUBLIC TO CONTACT NINE ONE ONE. AND EMERGENCY SERVICE SERVICES IT REQUIRES CARRIERS TO RESTORE REGULAR THE REGULAR TELEPHONE SERVICE WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS OR LESS ON STATEWIDE AVERAGE THIS IS BY NO MEANS AN IMPOSSIBLE STANDARD TO MEET. YET THE LARGEST SERVICE PROVIDERS ROUTINELY FAIL TO MEET THESE REQUIREMENTS WE DON'T HAVE DATA YET COMPLETELY FOR TWENTY NINETEEN BUT. FOR TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN T. STATEWIDE AVERAGE FOR SERVICE RESTORE ILL. WITH FORTY EIGHT PERCENT. FRONTIERS WITH SIXTY THREE PERCENT. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN EIGHTEEN TEASE WAS 56% AND FRONTIERS WAS 78% OF COURSE POURS SERVICE QUALITY LIMITS THE PUBLIC'S ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE ECONOMY. CONTACT NINE ONE ONE. ORDER RECEIVE COMMUNICATIONS DURING AN EMERGENCY. PURSUANT TO A PENALTY PROGRAM THAT WE ESTABLISHED IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE P. YOU SEE FIND THESE COMPANIES FOR FAILURE TO MEET THE SERVICE REQUIREMENTS. AS PERMITTED BY THE PROGRAM IN LIEU OF PAYING FINES INTO THE GENERAL FUND. THE COMPANY'S OPTED INSTEAD TO PAY TWICE THE AMOUNT OF THE FINES INTO PROJECTS THAT THE COMMISSION MONITORS. TO IMPROVE PARTS OF THE NETWORK THAT POOR SERVICE QUALITY OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS THE COMPANIES HAVE INVESTED SIXTEEN MILLION DOLLARS. IN SPECIFIC PARTS OF THE NETWORKS WHICH WERE FAILING IN LIEU OF PENALTIES. THERE ARE SEVERAL DIFFERENT TYPES OF OUTAGES REPORTS THAT THE SPEED YOU SEE FCC AND CARILLO YES REQUIRE WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO GO INTO. DETAIL ABOUT THOSE BUT AT A HIGH LEVEL AS I MENTIONED WE REQUIRE REPORTING ON THESE THREE SERVICE QUALITY REPORTS THESE METRICS. PROVIDERS ALSO MUST SUBMIT REPORTS TO US OF MAJOR SERVICE OUTAGES WHEN THEY OCCUR AND THESE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS TO EXTEND TO WIRELESS INVOICE PROVIDERS OUR SERVERS OUT IS REPORTING REQUIREMENT IS BASED ON THE FEDERAL COMMUNICATION STANDARDS NETWORK OUTAGE. REPORTING SYSTEM KNOWN AS NO WARS AND THESE REQUIRE ALL CARRIERS TO REPORT ON MARCH SERVICE OUTAGES THE SPECIFIC CRITERIA VARY DEPENDING ON THE LENGTH OF THE OUT ITS NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS AFFECTED. TYPE OF BUT IS IT ACTED SO THE- STATE THE FCC MAJOR OUTAGE REPORTING THERE'S A THIRD REPORTING REQUIREMENT WHICH IS VOLUNTARY IT'S KNOWN AS THE DISASTER INFORMATION REPORTING SYSTEM ORDERS. OF NOTE LARA THE OCTOBER POWER PS PS TWO ROOMS WITH THE FIRST TIME THAT THE FCC HAD ACTIVATED DOORS FOR CALIFORNIA. THE FCC ACTIVATES THAT IN CONSULTATION WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY AND PREVIOUSLY HAD ONLY ACTIVATED THIS FOR HURRICANES OR LARGE STORMS. AND THEN FINALLY CARILLO YES IS IN THE PROCESS OF IMPLEMENTING SB SEVEN SIX SEVENTY FROM LAST YEAR WHICH AS YOU KNOW IS INTENDED TO PROVIDE EVEN MORE TIMELY INFORMATION TO EMERGENCY RESPONDERS STATED PROPOSED RULES THAT ARE OUT FOR COMMENT DIRECTOR GIL TUCCI WILL SPEAK TO MORE TO THIS REQUIREMENT IN HIS TESTIMONY. SO THAT'S AN OVERVIEW OF THE OUR EXISTING SERVICE QUALITY RULES I WANT TO NOW TURN TO DISCUSS OUR NETWORK EXAM. THIS IS AN INVESTIGATION THE P. YOU SEE ORDERED. OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE NETWORKS OF EIGHTEEN T. CALIFORNIA AND FRONTIER THOSE ARE THE STATE'S TWO MAJOR LAND LINE PROVIDERS WE ORDERED AS A RESULT OF THEIR CONSISTENT FAILURE. TO MEET EXISTING SERVICE QUALITY METRICS THE REPORT COVERS THE PERIOD. TWENTY TEN TO TWENTY SEVENTEEN. KEY FINDINGS OF THE NETWORK EXAMPLE. WIRELINE SERVICE QUALITY HAS STEADILY DETERIORATED THEY'RE MORE OUTAGES SERVICE RESTORATION TIMES ARE GETTING LONGER. THE NETWORKS ARE NOT ROBUST AND RESILIENCE ARE RESILIENT. BOTH COMPANIES HAVE CUT BACK ON PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE THEY'RE NOT MAINTAINING THEIR NETWORKS TO WITHSTAND ENVIRONMENTAL AND WEATHER RELATED CONDITIONS. THE RESULT IS A STRONG RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BAD WEATHER AND SERVICE OUTAGES AND WE SAW THIS THIS FALL WITH THE WILD FIRES AND THE PSP EVENTS. BOTH COMPANIES HAVE BEEN DIS INVESTING IN INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THE TRADITIONAL LANDLINE OPERATIONS AND MOVING MONEY INTO OTHER BUSINESS AREAS. SUCH AS BROADBAND. EIGHTEEN T. IN PARTICULAR HAS FOCUSED ITS INVESTMENT ON PROVIDING SERVICE AND HIGHER INCOME COMMUNITIES. AS A RESULT THEIR CUSTOMERS IN LOWER INCOME AREAS EXPERIENCE MORE OUTAGES AND WERE SERVICE. AND THEN FINALLY THE EXAM FOUND THAT THERE IS A DIRECT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE AMOUNT OF COMPETITION IN THE AREA. AND SERVICE QUALITY RESULTS. IS WITH LOW COME LIMITED OR NO COMPETITION HAVE LOWER SERVICE QUALITY RESULTS. MEAN THAT CUSTOMERS WHO LIKELY HAVE NO ALTERNATIVE MEANS OF SERVICE TYPICALLY LESS POPULATED ROTORS AND THEREFORE RELY ON TRADITIONAL PHONE SERVICE THE MOST. EXPERIENCE THE WORST SERVICE QUALITY. WE RELEASED THE SUMMARY AND REDACTED PORTIONS OF THE REPORT THOSE ARE AVAILABLE ON OUR WEBSITE. WE'RE COMMITTED TO RELEASING ON REDACTED VERSIONS OF THE FULL REPORT. HOWEVER BOTH EIGHTEEN T. IN FRONT HERE HAVE FILED VERY SWEEPING CONFIDENTIALLY CONFIDENTIALITY CLAIMS ABOUT THE REPORT AS WE ARE REQUIRED BY LAW WE ARE GOING THROUGH EACH AND EVERYONE OF THEM CLAIMED BY CLAIMS. WITH AND WE'VE BEEN DOING THAT OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS AND WE HOPE TO RELEASE A LESS REDACTED VERSION. SOON SO NEXT STEPS. GOING FORWARD WE'RE GONNA BE LOOKING CLOSELY AT THE ISSUES HIGHLIGHTED. BY THE EXAM INCLUDING THE ADEQUACY OF OUR CURRENT SERVICE QUALITY METRICS. AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THE CURRENT PENALTY MECHANISMS. WILL ALSO CONSIDER WHAT SERVICE QUALITY ISSUES EXIST FOR OTHER TYPES OF COMMUNICATION SERVICES. I'D LIKE TO NOTE FINALLY THAT SOME OF THE IN THE IT IT IN EQUITIES IDENTIFIED IN THE NETWORK EXAM FOR TRADITIONAL PHONE SERVICE. ARE BEING FOUND IN OTHER. TYPES OF SERVICE BROADBAND AND OTHER SERVICES AS WELL. MANY OF YOU MAY BE FAMILIAR WITH A RECENT STUDY BY THE U. S. C. INDICATING THAT IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY. COMPETITION AND THE FASTEST BROADBAND SERVICES ARE LESS LIKELY TO OCCUR IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. THESE FINDINGS ARE TROUBLING. CONSISTENT WITH OUR STATUTORY MANDATES WE WILL CONTINUE WITH OUR INVESTIGATIONS ON OUR WORK TO ENSURE THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS HAVE FAIR ACCESS TO ESSENTIAL SERVICES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I'LL TURN TO PRESIDENT PATCHER. THANK YOU CLOSE. I AM FIGHTING OFF THAT COLD THAT HAS MADE THE ROUNDS PLEASE FORGIVE ME FOR MY VOICE THANK YOU A TEAR HUESO AND SENATORS- FOR INVITING ME HERE TODAY- MY NAME IS MERRY BILL BADGERING I'M PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. THIS PAST OCTOBER CALIFORNIA SUFFERED THROUGH MULTIPLE WILD FIRES AND THE PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF. IN IN SKEWS ME THE PS PS THE PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT UP EVENTS THAT IMPACTED COMMUNICATIONS NETWORKS THESE PS PST VANS IN PARTICULAR RESULTED IN MAJOR IMPACTS TO THE COMMUNICATIONS GRID. CUSTOMERS OF ALL SERVICES WERE IMPACTED WITH THEIR LAN LINE CABLE THE- I. P. OR WIRELESS CARRIERS REPORTED OUTAGES FOR NEAR HALF A MILLION WIRELINE CUSTOMERS AND ALMOST A MILLION WIRELESS CUSTOMERS. HUNDREDS OF CELL SITES WERE OUT OF SERVICE FOR VARIOUS LENGTHS OF TIME AND WHY WIRELINE FACILITIES ALSO SUFFERED IN. PARTICULARLY THE CABLE PROVIDERS FOR EXAMPLE MARIN COUNTY AND I THINK THIS IS NOTED IN YOUR- STAFF ANALYSIS AS WELL MARIN COUNTY HAD 57% OF ITS TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY CELLULAR TOWERS OUT OF SERVICE AT ONE TIME DURING THE PSP YES. ON OCTOBER TWENTY EIGHTH I JUST WANT TO UNDERSCORE THAT THE PERCENTAGES DON'T WELL REPRESENT MANY THOUSANDS AND IN SOME CASES MILLIONS OF PEOPLE IMPACTED. IN THE BAY AREA SENATE DOWNEY AND CONTRA COSTA COUNTY THERE WERE 11% OF CELL TOWERS FAILED TO WORK ACCORDING TO THE REPORTS FROM THE FCC. CINEMA LAKE HUMBOLDT SANTA CRUZ AND CALAVERAS COUNTIES HAD DAYS WHERE OVER 20% OF THE CELL TOWERS WERE OUT. LACK OF COMMUNICATION SERVICE IS NOT A MERE INCONVENIENCE IT ENDANGERS LIVES. CALIFORNIANS RELY ON THEIR PHONES AND THE INTERNET WHETHER WIRED OR WIRELESS TO RECEIVE EMERGENCY NOTIFICATIONS TO CONTACT FAMILY AND FRIENDS. AND TO REACH FIRST RESPONDERS SKEWS ME. THESE OUTAGES WERE UNEXPECTED GIVEN THE PREVIOUS ASSURANCES THAT THE COMMUNICATIONS COMPANY PROVIDED TO THE FCC TO YOU THE LATE LEGISLATURE AND TO WE THE CPUC THESE COMPANIES HAVE THE OBLIGATION AS WELL AS THE PRIVILEGE AND RESPONSIBILITY TO PROVIDE SERVICE TO THEIR CUSTOMERS THESE OUTAGES WERE UNACCEPTABLE. THE CPUC IS CLOSELY WORKING CLOSELY WITH CAL YES AND CAL FIRE TO ENSURE THAT THE COMMUNICATIONS CUSTOMERS ARE ABLE TO ACCESS THESE SERVICES AT ALL TIMES DURING AN EMERGENCY. OUR AGENCIES HAVE DIFFERENT ROLES BUT COLLECTIVELY WE SERVE TO ENSURE THE PUBLIC SAFETY. CAL YES AND CAL FIRE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR SITUATION MANAGEMENT AND NEEDS SPECIFIC AND ACTIONABLE INFORMATION IMMEDIATELY. THE CPUC HAS A RESPONSIBILITY TO DEVELOP RULES TO ENSURE SAFE AND RELIABLE SERVICE. THE CPUC IS WORKING TO ENSURE EMERGENCY RESPONDERS HAVE THE INFORMATION NECESSARY TO DO THEIR JOB AND THAT WE HAVE THE RULES IN PLACE TO HOLD SERVIE PROVIDERS ACCOUNTABLE. DURING THE PS PS EVENTS I WAS AT THE STATE OPERATIONS CENTER AND I SAW FIRST HAND HOW MUCH IMPROVEMENT IS INDEED NEEDED. PRIOR TO THE INTERVENTION FROM CAL O. E. S. DIRECTOR MARK KILLER DUTY THE ROOM FOR THE COMMUNICATIONS PROVIDER WAS PROVIDERS WAS NEARLY EMPTY. THE ENGAGEMENT AND THE DELIVERY OF REAL TIME INFORMATION DURING THIS CRITICAL PERIOD WAS SIMPLY NON EXISTENT CLEARLY THE EXISTING VOLUNTARY SYSTEM WHICH WAS MENTIONED BY HELEN. AND S. EARLIER IS NOT WORKING WE HAVE SEEN THAT COMMUNICATION CARRIERS REPORTING MUST BE IMPROVED MUST BE MORE RELIABLE. AND READILY AVAILABLE AND ACCESSIBLE TO THE PUBLIC AND THE COMPANIES THEMSELVES MUST IMPROVE SITUATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS. I AM THE ASSIGNED COMMISSIONER ON THE EMERGENCY DISASTER RELIEF MEASURES AB PROCEEDING THIS PROCEEDING SEEKS TO IMPROVE DISASTER RESPONSE AND CREATE A UNIFORM FRAMEWORK FOR ALL THE UTILITIES UNDER THE COMMISSION'S JURISDICTION. AS PART OF THIS PROCEEDING I SENT A LETTER ON NOVEMBER THIRTEENTH TO THE LARGEST COMMUNICATION PROVIDERS IN CALIFORNIA REGARDING THEIR PERFORMANCE DURING THE OCTOBER PS PS EVENTS. I YES THE COMMUNICATION SERVICE PROVIDERS TO REPORT THE AMOUNT OF BACKUP POWER CURRENTLY AVAILABLE AVAILABLE TO PINPOINT LOCATIONS IN THEIR NETWORKS THAT REQUIRE HARDENING FOR WILDFIRE AND PS PSP EVENTS. AND I CALLED A PUBLIC MEETING TO HEAR RESPONSES FROM THE COMPANY EXECUTIVES. ON NOVEMBER EIGHTEENTH MAJOR WIRELESS WIRELINE AND CABLE PROVIDERS OF VOICE SERVICES RESPONDED WITH THE AMOUNT OF BACKUP POWER THEIR FACILITIES HAVE AND THE PLANS IN WHICH FOR REFUELING IT PLANS IN PLACE FOR RE FUELING THE GENERATORS. IN ADDITION WE OBTAIN DATA ON THE NUMBER OF CELL SITES. LOCATED IN TIER TWO AND TIER THREE FIRE THREAT AREAS AS WELL AS THE AMOUNT AND TYPE OF BACKUP POWER AT THESE LOCATIONS. COLLECTIVELY THE DATA ILLUSTRATES THE CURRENT CONDITION OF RESILIENCY OF OUR COMMUNICATIONS GRET. THIS INFORMATION WILL BE USED TO INFORM AND GUIDE THE POLICY THAT STRENGTHENS OUR COMMUNICATIONS GRID PREPARES IT TO WITHSTAND DISASTERS AND INSURERS IT WILL REMAIN OPERATIONAL DURING PS PS EVENTS AND DISASTERS. THE HEARING ON NOVEMBER TWENTIETH WAS SPECIFICALLY HELD TO ADDRESS FAILURES IN THE COMMUNICATION NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE DURING THE FIRES AND THE PS PS EVENTS I MADE IT VERY CLEAR. THAT THEIR FAILURES WERE NOT ACCEPTABLE I HIGHLIGHTED THE COMMUNICATION ISSUES WIH THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES AND THE NEED FOR STANDARDS FOR BACKUP POWER AND PUBLIC OUTAGE. REPORTING AT THE HEARING CARRIERS INFORMED ME THAT THEY HAD ADVANCED A- ALL POWER ON AMENDED AUTOMATED SKEWS ME NETWORK COMP OPERATION SYSTEMS AND YET. AND YET WE HAVE CARRIERS WHO HAVE NOT PROVIDED INFORMATION TO OUR STATE WARNING CENTER. AT THAT TIME IF CARE IS HAVE THESE ADVANCED SYSTEMS WHY ARE THEY NOT BEING SHARED WITH CAL O. E. S. OR THE PUBLIC TO ENHANCE PUBLIC SAFETY. GOING FORWARD THIS PROCEEDING WILL FOCUS ON THE ADOPTION OF FURTHER RULES TO ADDRESS COMMUNICATION NETWORK OUTAGES DURING EMERGENCY EVENTS TO KEEP THE COMMUNICATION NETWORKS FUNCTION. ON DECEMBER EIGHTEENTH THE CPUC ISSUED AS MENTIONED EARLIER A RULING THAT INCLUDES ENABLING TRANSPARENT COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN INDUSTRY FIRST RESPONDERS ACROSS THE GOVERNMENT AND THE PUBLIC IN A TIMELY MANNER DURING DISASTROUS EVENTS AND DEVELOPING. REQUIREMENTS FOR RESILIENT AND DEPENDABLE COMMUNICATIONS GRID TO FURTHER ADDRESS COMMUNICATIONS OUTAGES DURING EMERGENCY EVENTS. ADDITIONALLY LAST SPRING THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S OFFICE MODE AS IT ENTERED A MOTION IN THE EMERGENCY MEASURES PROCEEDING WHICH RAISED IMPORTANT ISSUES REGARDING RESILIENCY AND YOU WILL HEAR FROM THEM LATER TODAY THEY ADVOCATED FOR SPECIFIC DUTIES FOR CARRIERS FOR THE DELIVERY. OF NINE ONE ONE. CALLS AND ROBUST BATTERY BACKUP REQUIREMENTS WROTE DIVERSITY AND ASKED US TO IMPROVE THE RELIABILITY OF ALERT WARNINGS WE WANT TO BRING THESE PROPOSALS INTO OUR PUBLIC PROCESS. IN A IN A SECOND C. U. P. C. IN A SECOND HEARING PC UCC PROCEEDING TO WHICH I AM ALSO A SIGNED THE D. ENERGY IS ATION PROCEEDING WE WILL REFINE THE P. S. P. S. PLANNING AND NOTIFICATION GUIDELINES SO COMMUNICATIONS SERVICE PROVIDERS RECEIVED THE INFORMATION THEY NEED TO MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF PSP A- P. S. P. S. OF DENSE. ON THEIR NETWORKS AND PURCHASE PLANNING EXERCISE WITH THE ELECTRIC I USE IN ADVANCE OF THE WILDFIRE SEASON. ON JOHN JANUARY FIRST AS HELEN MENTIONED THE P. YOU SEE CODE SECTION SEVEN TEN WHICH DE REGULATED INTERNET BASED SERVICES SUNSET IT. THE COMMISSION TAKES THIS RESTORATION OF OUR FORTY AND NEW RESPONSIBILITY SERIOUSLY. AS I AS HAS BEEN CONVEYED BY MY COLLEAGUES TODAY AND BY RECENT EVENTS THERE'S CONSIDERABLE ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT WITHIN THE INDUSTRY. GOING FOR THE COMMISSION WILL SEEK TO PROTECT PUBLIC SAFETY AND TO INSURE QUALITY OF SERVICE INCLUDING CONTINUE PROVISIONS OF NINE ONE ONE AND OTHER EMERGENCY SERVICES VITAL TO PUBLIC SAFETY AS PROTECTING THE PUBLIC HEALTH SAFETY AND THE GENERAL WELFARE. WE ARE ALREADY WORKING TO EXTEND THE PROTECTIONS PROVIDED. TO THE REST OF THE TELEPHONE CUSTOMERS TO CONSUMERS WITH COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE ALLIED PEACE SERVICE. AND ANY MORE SUBSTANTIVE CHANGES TO PROTECTIONS WILL FOR THE CONSUMERS WILL GO THROUGH THE COMMISSIONER'S FORMAL PROCESS. THE COMMISSION'S FORMAL PROCESS WHICH WILL GIVE THE PUBLIC AN INDUSTRY AMPLE NOTICE AN OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF ANY REGULATORY CHANGES. WELL BEFORE THE NEXT WILDFIRE SEASON STARTS WE MUST TOGETHER DETERMINE HOW WE VIEW NINE ONE ONE EMERGENCY ALERTS AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE COMMUNICATIONS ARE THESE NECESSITIES THAT SHOULD BE ACCESSED UNFAILINGLY. EVEN WHEN THE POWER IS OUT SHOULD IT MATTER IF THE SERVICE IS A LAND LINE SERVICE OR WIRELESS OR INTERNET BASED SERVICE ALL OF THESE INITIATIVES ARE RESPONSIBLE. AND WITH IN OUR STATUTORY MANDATE THERE ARE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS AND THE ESSENTIAL COMPONENTS OF PUBLIC SAFETY WHICH SHOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME I APPRECIATE THE INVITATION FOR BEING HERE WITH MY COLLEAGUES THANK YOU FOR. ONE OF THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. DISPATCHER I KNOW YOU'RE NEW TO THE POSITION BUT WE'VE- WE'VE BECOME A STATE THAT SO DEPEND ON ELECTRICITY AND YOU OVERSEE ELECTRICITY AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND YOU OVERSEE TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND WE'VE BEEN SEEING TRENDS. FOR DECADES NOW PEOPLE LEAVING HARD-LINE TO CELL PHONES IN THIS BEEN GOING ON FOR SOME TIME AND YES IF I WERE JUST DID USE AN EXAMPLE YOU KNOW TRYING TO. RE IMPLEMENT A NEW TAX YOU KNOW THEY THEY WERE THEY FELL BEHIND THE TREND. YOU KNOW ALMOST A DECADE OR SO ON ON WATCHING HOW THINGS WERE CHANGING AND HOW THEY HAD TO CHARGE. TAXPAYERS FOR THE- CHARGE TO HAVE A NINE ONE ONE SERVICE SIDE I'M JUST CURIOUS IF YOU COULD TELL ME ONE OR TWO OR THREE INITIATIVES THAT THE CPUC. PURSUED. FIFTEEN TEN FIVE YEARS AGO TO. TO TELL THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY AND THE ELECTRIC INDUSTRY HEY YOU IF THIS HAPPENS YOU SHOULD BE PREPARED LIKE- HAVE A BACK UP GENERATOR. OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT WHAT WHAT WHAT IS THE CPUC DONE TO BE PROACTIVE OVER THE LAST DECADE OR TWO. AND THANK YOU CENTER MORE LOCK ON AS YOU RIGHTLY STATED I'M NEW TO THE CITY. AS OF. AUGUST SIXTEENTH- AND I THINK SOME OF THOSE ACTIONS WERE OUTLINED IN- HELEN'S TESTIMONY AND EVEN SOME WERE. IN COMMISSIONER WRECK SHAMANS TESTIMONY BUT I'M GONNA TURN TO- HELEN TO FURTHER AND NANCY EIGHT SOME OF THOSE ITEMS THAT WE HAVE UNDERTAKEN. INDEED SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE NOT BEEN I'M GONNA USE THE WORD ALLOWED. TO IMPLEMENT. HELLO. SENATOR OUT AND PRESIDENT MATCHER THE COMMISSION. HAS. NOT BEEN AS. HAS NOT REGULARLY NEW SERVICES TO THE EXTENT REGULATED OLDER SERVICES THAT WAS THE. JUST OF MY TESTIMONY AND SO WE HAVE THE COMMISSION HAS ALLOWED NASCENT INDUSTRIES LIKE WIRELESS AND BEFORE SECTION SEVEN TEN WAS PASSED V. O. I. P. TO JUST DEVELOP WITHOUT MUCH REGULATION WE WERE CONSTRAINED BY FEDERAL LAW FROM REGULATING WIRELESS RATES TREE- AND WE DID ATTEMPT TO ADOPT BACKUP POWER RULES AND ACTUALLY THE FCC DID THAT AS WELL THEN THE FCC'S EFFORT FAILED. IN THE COMMISSION ADOPTED RULES FOR THE RULES REALLY JUST ABOUT NOTICE TO CUSTOMERS. AND WE HAVE. TAKING A CLOSER LOOK AT THIS MORE RECENTLY BUT IN PAST YEARS IT WAS REALLY MORE OF AN EMPHASIS ON. ALLOWING THESE INDUSTRIES TO DEVELOP AND THAT WAS CONSISTENT WITH LEGISLATIVE DIRECTION AS WELL. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SENATE JACKSON. I'D LIKE TO TAKES LIKE A DIFFERENT APPROACH TO THIS. I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE HAS BEEN A BATTLE BETWEEN THE FCC AND WHAT THE STATE'S CAN DO- YOU'VE BEEN LIMITED BY CERTAIN FEDERAL LAWS LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT TODAY MY UNDERSTANDING FROM YOUR TESTIMONY IS THAT THE FCC TRIED TO REASSERT SOME OF THOR EDDIE THAT YOU BELIEVE THE STATE HAS. STATE HAS PREVAILED. SENATOR YOU REFERRING TO THE BROADBAND ISSUE. OKAY SO MY QUESTION IS WEIRD DO YOU BELIEVE THE STATE HAS THE AUTHORITY THAT WE HAVE NOT EXERCISED THAT WE NEED TO EXERCISE OVER THE COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK SPECIFICALLY THE WIRELESS NETWORKS WE KNOW DURING THE PS PS. A THE BARK COALS THAT AS YOU MENTIONED SO MANY THE SYSTEMS WERE DOWN. WE HAD IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN NO ABILITY TO ASCERTAIN WHY THEY WERE DOWN BECAUSE THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANIES DIDN'T FEEL THEY HAD THAT THEY OWED US ANY OBLIGATION TO THAT THAT THEY WERE UNDER NO REQUIREMENTS. TO COMPLY TO BE PART OF THE. DURING OUR- FORTY DAYS OF THOMAS FIRE IN THE SUBSEQUENT DEBRIS FLOW THAT COMMUNICATIONS NETWORKS WHENEVER HE A MERCHANT SEE OFFICES WERE NOT ENGAGED TO TOLD US BASICALLY TO GO POUND SAND- AND SO TO THE EXTENT THAT WE DO HAVE. THE AUTHORITY OR THAT WE SHOULD HAVE THE AUTHORITY WHAT IS SEEK YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE. IN ORDER FOR- WIRELESS COMPANIES TO NOT ONLY BE RESPONSIVE BUT RESPONSIBLE. AND TAKE A STRONG ROLE IN TRYING TO SURE THAT WHEN WE HAVE THESE ADVANCE WE DON'T LOSE OUR COMMUNICATIONS NETWORKS FOR THE BASIS OF NOT ONLY FOR OUR ECONOMY. BUT ALSO THE SECURITY IN THE SAFETY OF OUR ABILITY AS FAMILIES TO COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER WHEN THE SYSTEM'S GOING. DID IT LITERALLY IN EVERY WAY SHAPE AND FORM THAT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE WHAT CAN WE APPEAR ON THIS DIET IS DUE TO HELP YOU MAKE THESE COMPANIES MORE ACCOUNTABLE AND RESPONSIBLE. I'LL TAKE A FIRST SWING AND THAT SENATOR AND THEN TURNED TO MY COLLEAGUES- WE HAVE PROCEEDINGS THAT I MENTIONED IN MY TESTIMONY THAT ARE UNDER WAY WERE WE WILL BE FLUSHING OUT SOME OF THE AUTHORITY. THAT WE DO HAVE AND SOME OF THE RESTORED AUTHORITY S. SINCE THE SUN SETTING OF SEVEN TEN- BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY WE NEED TO HAVE A LIABILITY AND AS HAS BEEN WELL STATED TODAY. AND RELIABILITY WILL COME IN THE MOST. YEAH IT IN THE MOST CURRENT TIME AND IN THE NEAR FUTURE WITH BATTERY BACKUP AND GENERATION. AND THAT TAKES DIFFERENT FORMS ON DIFFERENT SYSTEMS BUT- AND I CERTAINLY RESPECT THAT HOWEVER- THEY THE THAT IS WHAT WE NEED WE HAVE TO HAVE A LIABILITY ISSUE SO WELL MENTION SENATOR. YOU HAVE DEAD AIR. NO COMMUNICATIONS THAT IMPACTS WAS WAS WELL STATED IN THE STAFF AND NOW IS THAT IMPACTS HOSPITALS IT IN PACKS- THE COMMERCE OF OUR STATE TAX EVERYTHING AND THEN THEN WE HAVE POWER SURGES WHEN THEY COME BACK ON AS WELL. ACT SO WE THE RELIABILITY AND WE HAVE TO GET THEIR LIFE AND THEY NEED TO ALSO IT HERE TO THE- GUIDELINES THAT WE HAVE ALREADY INSTITUTED IN TERMS OF WHEN THAT HOW LONG THEY HAVE TO. HAVE THAT BACK UP AND THAT RELIABILITY AND HOW SOON THEY HAVE TO HAVE IT. SO HELEN ARE THERE SOME COUPLE THINGS I PROBABLY MISSED IT WOULD LIKE TO ENUNCIATE THANK YOU PRESIDENT BASHER CENERS AT THE WHAT I WOULD SAY IS. WE ALSO NEED TO MOVE OFF OF VOLUNTARY DISCLOSURE I KNOW THAT A BILL PASSED THIS YEAR- OR RATHER IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN AND IT DIDN'T IS A MOVE IN THAT DIRECTION WE HAVE TO SEE HOW THAT. UNFOLDS BUT THE FIRST RESPONDERS HAVE PULLED THE COMMISSION. IN PUBLIC TWICE WHEN I'VE BEEN PRESENT THAT VOLUNTARY JUST REPORTING OF OUTAGE INFORMATION IS SIMPLY NOT GOOD ENOUGH THEY'RE GETTING INFORMATION IN CASE IN IN CONSISTENT FORMATS. SPENT JUST THE REPORTING IS THREE AND DOESN'T WORK SO WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THAT AND TO. WE NEED HELP PLEDGES I THINK A LOT OF. WITH MY LIFE HEARING HAD IN NOVEMBER WHERE WE GOD FEARING COMMITMENTS FROM THE CARRIER THE DEGREE TO WHICH THEY WERE WILLING TO PUBLICLY DISCLOSE THEIR OUTAGE INFORMATION IN MY LAST QUESTION IS DO YOU BELIEVE WE HAVE THE AUTHORITY IS A STATE TO IMPOSE THAT REQUIREMENT OR IS THAT SOMETHING THAT THE FCC HAS PREEMPTED. I'M THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS THE AUTHORITY TO IMPOSE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. AND ALSO TO IT WOULD REQUIRE BACKUP POWER. I THINK YOU'LL GET A DIFFERENT ANSWER FROM THE INDUSTRY. THE OWNER OF. THE MEASURE CHAIRED AND CHAIRMAN OF THE THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY- SO I HAPPEN TO REPRESENT TO SOME OF THOSE RULE AREAS SINCE THE FIRST OF FIRST I JUST WANT TO MAKE A STATEMENT. THE P. YOU SEE. SAYS THAT THE PROVIDERS DON'T DISCLOSE IN THE PROVIDER SAY THE P. YOU SEE DOZEN NEWS TO WORK SO I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS AND I'M GONNA BE ASKING THEM THE SAME QUESTIONS WE'RE IN A DIFFERENT TIME NOW WHERE WE HAVE. WE HAVE POWER OUTAGES IT WASN'T COMMON FIVE YEARS AGO WE'VE HAD CATASTROPHIC WILD FIRE THAT WAS A- COMMON FIVE YEARS AGO. BUT THE LEGISLATURE IN THE AND THE. TAXPAYERS OR RATE PAYERS I SHOULD SAY HAVE STEPPED UP TO THE PLATE. WE DID A BILL LAST YEAR THAT INCREASE THE FEE FOR NINE ONE ONE SERVICES I KNOW THAT THAT MONIES IN THE PIPELINE AND ISN'T. ON THE GROUND YET. SO WE STEPPED UP THERE WE ALSO PASSED A BILL. COUPLE YEARS BACK YES SIXTEEN SIXTY TWO WHICH. DR MONEY TO LOW INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS. KAMALA YOUR SOME OF YOUR COSTITUENTS DO AND ALSO FOR RULE AREAS WHERE WE PROVIDED ASSISTANCE FOR- NON PROFITS A IN THE UTILITIES TO BE ABLE TO GO OUT AND PROVIDE INTERNET SERVICES TO LIBRARIES HOSPITALS AND UNDERSERVED AREAS. FIRST SO WE'VE STEPPED UP SO MY QUESTION TO YOU IS WITH ALL THOSE THINGS PUT INTO PLACE WHAT WOULD YOU WHAT WOULD YOU RECOMMEND TO THE LEGISLATURE. TO HELP. BRING POWER BACK ON IN A MORE MAN OR NOT I DON'T WANT TO HEAR THAT THE I MEAN ASKED HIM THE SAME QUESTIONS AGAIN ON THE OPPORTUNITY TO I'M TRYING TO FIND OUT THE FACTS SO I KNOW WERE TO MOVE WE'VE DONE A LOT AT THE ON OUR SIDE I BELIEVE ON OUR SIDE OF IT. BUT WE NEED THE FACTS THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY GET DOWN TO WHERE WE GET THE SERVICES OUT TO OUR CONSTITUENTS WHEN WE HAVE THESE CATASTROPHIC EVENTS NOW I HAPPEN TO REPRESENT- PARADISE- WHEN I WAS IN THE ASSEMBLY. AND I WILL TELL YOU. THE WELL IT'S OTHER PROVIDERS WHERE THERE. WHEN THE WHEN THE LINES WERE DOWN AND THEY SET UP TOWERS AND WE WERE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE SOMEWHAT AFTER THE FIRE IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE FIRE WHEN THE SMOKE WAS STILL IT WAS STILL SMOKING. BUT WHEN YOU'RE IN. SISKIYOU OR YOUR IN ALPINE OR YOUR IN NEVADA COUNTY AND YOU HAVE A FIRE A TEENS FIRE THERE'S NO POSSIBLE WAY YOU CAN GET THE POWER UP IN FORTY EIGHT HOURS WHEN YOU'RE- WORKING IN MOUNTAINS LIKE THIS. AND THE MOST OF THOSE CONSTITUENTS ARE ON LAND LINES OUT THERE BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE CELL SERVICES. SO YOU HAVE TO COMPARE APPLES TO APPLES. AND SO THAT'S WHAT I'M ASKING YOU WHAT WHAT WHAT WOULD YOU RECOMMEND TO THIS LEGISLATURE DO. WITH THESE NEW. POWER OUTAGES THAT WE'RE GONNA SEE FOR THE FUTURE THAT'S THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO KNOW AND I DON'T WANT TO HEAR BLAME I WOULD SAY IF IT'S ON THERE AND I WANT THEM THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO. SAY I WANT TO ME TELL ME WHO'S AT FAULT. BECAUSE WE'VE I THINK STEPPED UP IN THE TAXPAYERS AND RATEPAYERS OF STEPPED UP NOW IT'S TIME TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE- COORDINATE BETWEEN YOU. AND THEM TO GET IT DONE. SENATOR IS THANK YOU AND YOU HAVE STEPPED UP. AND WE GREATLY APPRECIATE IT AND- SOME OF THE- THE STEPS THAT YOU HAVE DONE WITH TO ARTICULATED TODAY AND WE- WILL BE IN THEM. PROCEEDINGS THAT I MENTIONED FURTHER EXAMINING AND- A UTILIZING AND IMPLEMENTING SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE NOW HAVE THE- AUTHORITY AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO. I AGREE WITH YOU THE BLAME GAME DOESN'T WORK WE POINTING THE FINGER TO THE INDUSTRY. AND ANDERSON PUTTING THE FINGER BACK AT US IT DOESN'T WORK I WILL ADMIT. IN MY- HEARING IN NOVEMBER I DID GET A LITTLE EMOTIONAL ABOUT THE FACT THAT I DIDN'T THINK THEY SHOWED UP THE WAY THEY NEEDED TO AND IN THE OCTOBER NOVEMBER EVENTS. BUT THE TOOLS WE NEED ARE THE TOOLS WE DISCUSSED AND- WE NEED INFORMATION WE NEED DATA WE NEED TO KNOW WHERE PEOPLE ARE AWARE WHERE THE OUTAGES ARE WE NEED TO KNOW. WHY THEY ARE WE NEED TO KNOW. WHAT'S ON CERTAIN POLLS I KNOW THAT'S NOT SPECIFIC TO TODAY BUT WE DON'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION- AND SO IF THINGS IF POLLS GO DOWN FOR EXAMPLE HAVE NO CLUE WHAT. WHO'S WHO'S ON THAT POLE. BUT THERE UTILIZING HOW THE UTILIZING THAT. AT FOR WHAT. AND I THINK A COMBINATION OF THE INFORMATION THAT- YES- CALLOW YES NEEDS AS WELL AS CAL FIRE IN THE ON AND- SEE BE UC'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF DATA. AND AS I MENTIONED BEFORE THE RELIABILITY IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AND THOSE ARE THINGS ARE WORKING ON AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE INDUSTRY ON DOING. IT WE HAVE TO. DO MY COLLEAGUES TO DO ANYTHING ELSE. NO I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD I THINK PRESIDENT VENTURE HAS COVERED THAT THANK YOU SENATOR BRADFORD. THANK YOU AM I THINK. THANK CHAIRMAN FOR. CLEANING THIS HEARING TODAY AND WHAT BRINGS YOUR IS. PS PS BUT REALLY WHAT BRINGS HERE'S WHAT'S SOMETHING ON A COMMISSIONER. RUSSIA IVAN- TOUCHED UPON AND WHAT WE LEARNED IN 200-010-2000 ELEVEN. THE WALL FULL MAINTENANCE OF INFRASTRUCTURE BUYER TELECOMMUNICATIONS. COMPANIES AND WE SAW IT WITH THE RAIN AND THE END OF 200-010-2000 LEVEL ONE OUT. THOUSANDS OF CUSTOMERS WERE OUT OF PHONE SERVICE FOR. MANY MANY DAYS AND WE HAD HEARINGS. HERE AND DOWN IN LOS ANGELES AND WE GET THEIR OWN EMPLOYEES THE COMMUNICATION WORKERS OF AMERICA COME BEFORE US AND TESTIFIED. THAT THE A WORK ORDERS THIS HIGH. THAT WEREN'T BEING WORKED. AND IT'S CRITICAL TO CONTINUE TO MAKE THE ARGUMENT THAT. WHILE THE CUSTOMERS ARE MIGRATING AWAY FROM THE LAND LINE BUT THAT LAND LINE IS STILL CRITICAL TO EVERYTHING THAT WE DO WHETHER IT'S WIRELESS SERVICE WHETHER IT'S FOR YOU. AND THAT LAST MILE THAT COPPER IS NOT BEING MAINTAINED SO I NEED TO UNDERSTAND. WHERE ARE WE HOLDING YOUR FEET TO THE FIRE IT WAS THE IN VERIZON. AND EIGHTEEN T. NOW IT'S FRONTIER EIGHTEEN TO WHAT ARE WE DOING TO MAKE SURE THAT CAUGHT HIS MAINTAIN THIS CRITICAL NOT ONLY THE LAND LINE CUSTOMER BUT- WIRELESS. THE WHITE. HOUSE BURKE AND ROOM SHE HAD MORE WORN. OUT SENATOR THE STATE. ALLOCATED OUT BEST FOR THOSE RURAL AREAS. THAT INFRASTRUCTURE SHE CRITICAL IT'S NOT BEING MET THANK. SENATOR BRADFORD WE I THINK YOU DID IT QUITE WELL WE NOW HAVE THE FINDINGS OF THIS NETWORK EXAMINATION THAT PLAINLY LAY OUT WHAT THE CARRIERS ARE NOT DOING. WE HAVE A SYSTEM IN PLACE FOR FINING THEM BUT WE DON'T KNOW IF IT'S WORKING IF IT'S SUFFICIENT WE DON'T KNOW IF THE EXISTING METRICS ARE ENOUGH IF WE NEED TO EXPAND THEM. AND WE'RE GONNA BE LOOKING AT THAT RIGHT AWAY IN THIS NEXT YEAR. BUT AGAIN WE KNEW THAT IN TWO THOUSAND TEN WE KNEW IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN. AND ARE WE- AGAIN HAVING ONGOING DIALOGUE TO MAKE SURE LIKE TO SAY THIS. COPPER IS MAINTAINED THAT LAOS LAST FALL SERVICES CRITICAL TO EVERYTHING THAT WE DO HERE. GOING. FOR IT TO END THE SOMETHING TO ASK THE CARRIERS ABOUT IT'S A VERY BIG CHALLENGE BECAUSE THEY ARE DISINVEST TING IN THOSE TRADITIONAL SERVICES THEY- SEE. MORE OPPORTUNITIES IN BROADBAND ANOTHER SERVICES WIRELESS SERVICES. AS YOU KNOW THERE'S STILL MILLIONS OF CUSTOMERS IN CALIFORNIA DEPEND ON TRADITIONAL LAND LINES WE SEE WHAT A VITAL ROLE THEY PLAY IN EMERGENCIES IN NINE ONE ONE ONE OTHER. POWERS OFF. IN THOSE NETWORKS NEED TO BE MAINTAINED. I THINK WE'RE HOPEFUL THAT TAKING A CLOSER LOOK IN COMING UP WITH NEW RULES WILL ENSURE CONTINUED INVESTMENT I THINK STRONG LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT AND HOLDING THE CARRIER'S FEET TO THE FIRE WILL HELP AS WELL. CENTER GLAZER. AT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN LET ME OF PERCENT SAY I APPRECIATE THE SPECIAL INVITATION TO BE A PART OF THE DAY THE IMPACT OF THE PS PS Và ACROSS THE STATE OF THE BEEN PROFOUND AND IT'S CERTAINLY IN MY AREA AS WELL AND I THINK THAT THE TO THE CHAIRS LEADERSHIP ON THIS SAY IT TO HEARINGS WITHIN A MATTER OF US SIXTY DAYS IS AN INDICATION I THINK OF WHAT YOU FEEL IS. HOW THE URGENCY THAT YOU BRING TO THIS ISSUE WITH THE YOU KNOW IT IS SO CRITICAL THAT- AS A LOT OF QUESTIONS I HAVE BEEN ASKED ONE I'D ASK YOU TO THE PRESIDENT. OF THE COMMISSION. AS WE- YOU KNOW THE THAT. WE'VE WE'VE HEARD ABOUT THE LANDSCAPE YOU'VE LAID IT OUT. BUT THE THING THAT MY- RESIDENTS ASK ME. IS IT STEVE. NINE MONTHS FROM NOW WE'RE GONNA BE IN THE EXACT SAME HIGH RISK MOMENT. AGAIN AND HAVE YOU DONE EVERYTHING THAT YOU CAN DO. TO ENSURE THAT WHAT WE EXPERIENCE. BEFORE WILL NOT HAPPEN AGAIN AND SO MATTER PRESIDENT THAT'S REALLY MY SIMPLE QUESTION TO YOU. THAT YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH THAT. WHAT THE CARRIERS OF SAID YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH THE INFASTRUCTURE CIRCUMSTANCES. WHAT INSURANCE IS CAN OU GIVE US AND WE ARE PARTNERS IN THIS AND I RESPECT AND RECOGNIZE THAT BUT THAT WE WILL NOT BE IN THE SAME SITUATION NINE MONTHS FROM NOW WHAT. WHAT ASSURANCE CAN YOU GIVE US. WELL I THINK. ARM EQ WELL STATED IT WE'RE ALL PARTNERS IN THIS AND THAT INCLUDES THE INDUSTRY AS WELL. SO ON IT'S THE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT THAT SO VERY IMPORTANT. IT'S THE DIFFERENT ENTITIES WITHIN THE STATE GOVERNMENT. A CAT THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES CAL FIRES AND THE P. UC WE HAVE PROCEEDINGS THAT ARE UNDER WAY. THAT WILL ESTABLISH ADDITIONAL RULES AND AUTHORITIES IN OVERSIGHT. I CAN'T PREJUDGE THAT HOWEVER- THOSE OF SOME OF THE THINGS ARE LOOKING AT THESE PROCEEDINGS WILL NOT GO ON FOR YEARS. I WILL MAKE SURE OF THAT- WE ARE- WE ARE AS AS MY COLLEAGUES HAVE SAID WERE ALSO REVIEWING THINGS IN A POST. SUNSET OF SEVEN TEN DODD ERA OF LOOKING INTO OTHER THINGS THAT WE CAN HOLD THE INDUSTRY RESPONSIBLE FOR I THINK THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE ALREADY. DONE TALKED ABOUT THOSE THINGS THAT WE HAVE HAD THEM TESTIFY TO. NEED TO BE FULLY IMPLEMENTED. AND AGAIN I DON'T MEAN TO POINT THE FINGER BUT WE ARE ALL IN A PARTNERSHIP HERE. THE PC HAS TO BE THE REGULATOR AND WE HAVE TO CARRY OUT OUR REGULATORY RESPONSIBILITIES WHETHER THAT MEANS- NEW AUTHORITY. OR WHAT THAT MEANS ADDITIONAL OVERSIGHT OR FRANKLY WHETHER THAT MEANS PENALTIES. BUT NONE OF US NONE OF US. WANTS TO EVER SEE A FIRE SEASON LIKE WHAT WE EXPERIENCED THIS PAST FALL AND I'D THAT GOES FOR ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES IN STATE GOVERNMENT FROM THE GOVERNOR ON DOWN THEN IN PLEASE IN MY COLLEAGUES CAN ADD ANYTHING TO THAT. GUY WHICH IS STANDARD PRESIDENT VETERAN MENTIONED EARLIER THE- EMERGENCY MEASURES PROCEEDING THAT THAT IS UNDER HER OVERSIGHT AND THAT HAS AS- AN ELEMENT IN THE NEXT PHASE WHICH IS LAUNCHING NOW- THE ISSUE OF BACKUP POWER AND WHAT WE DO ABOUT THAT. SO WE ARE MOVING ON THAT CAN YOU JUST EXPAND ON THE TIMING OF IT. OKAY I CAN'T BECAUSE I'M NOT SURE WHEN THE SCOPING MAMMAL HAS GONE OUT OR IS GOING OUT BUT ONCE IT'S GIVING THEM A CLOSE OUT THEN WE SET TO SCHEDULE FOR THE PRECEDING. COMMENTS I DON'T THINK HEARINGS ARE GONNA BE REQUIRED BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT FOR SURE I DON'T WANT TO PRE JUDGE- BUT DO YOU HAVE GOALS IN TERMS OF ONE YOU WANT YOU WANT TO FINALIZE A PROCESS. HI I DON'T DO IT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND IT AND WE DON'T WANT TO BE BUREAUCRATIC AND EXPLAINING RIGHT. OUR PROCESS BECAUSE MY GOD I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND IT MYSELF AFTER BEING THERE FOR JUST. THREE FOUR MONTHS- SO WON'T DO THAT TO YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN BUT- THE SCOPING MEMO WE CAN- IN THAT IT'S MY PRECEDING I CAN HAVE SOME OVERSIGHT OVER THE- TIMELINESS OF THAT. THANK YOU AND I THINK THAT'LL BE IMPORTANT GIVEN. THE CONCERNS RAISED OVER TIME IN AND I'M NOT APPROACHING FIRE SEASON. WE'RE GONNA MOVE ONTO CENTER MCGUIRE. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIR- AYE AYE TWO ONE ECHO THE THANKS TO THE CHAIR THE THAT. THE TEARS BEEN ON THIS ISSUE POWER SHUT OFFS- SINCE BEFORE THE HOLIDAYS MAKING SURE WE DON'T REPEAT. THE HOT MESS THAT WE HAD- OVER THE SUMMER AND INTO THE FALL. THANK CALIFORNIANS ARE BETTER AND VERY GRATEFUL FOR YOUR WORK ALONG WITH PROTEINS WORK IS WELL- JUST WANT TO CLARIFY ONE ISSUE- MISTER CHAIR THERE IS A- A COMMENT MADE EARLIER- YES HAS BEEN MOVING FAST ENOUGH FIND NINE ONE ONE UPGRADE. THE MOVE IN TEL. THANK YOU FOR. THEY'RE ABOUT TO TAKE IN AND IT WAS DEFEATED BY THIS LEGISLATURE SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE. THAT WE MAKE IT VERY CLEAR WE HAD TO WAIT TO THE LEGISLATOR PROVE THE FUNDING. SO THAT- WE ASK AN IMPLEMENT A NINE ONE ONE UPGRADE TO NEXT AND NUMBER ONE. AND THEN PRESIDENT IN IT ECHO WHERE CENTER GLAZER WAS AND I JUST TWO QUICK QUESTIONS RIGHT AFTER THAT. I KNOW YOU'RE THE SCOPING MEMO BUT I THINK THAT. MEMBERS AND I DON'T SPEAK FOR FOLKS BUT I THINK ALL THIS ONE HERE HOW YOU'RE GOING TO EXPEDITE PROCEEDINGS. PRIOR TO FIRE SEASON- AND THAT'S REALLY THE HEALTH IN THE ROOM ON THE PUBLIC UTILITY SIDE. I KNOW THIS IS A FRUSTRATION FOR YOU BUT- YOU TALK ABOUT RULES AND OVERSIGHT. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN AND THEN WHAT CALVET WHAT IN YOUR MIND WHAT CAN CALIFORNIANS EXPECTING PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION PRIOR TO FIRE SEASON AT ALL TO SAY. LATE SUMMER EARLY FALL WHAT CAN EXPECT WHAT TYPE OF ACTION WILL THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION BE ACTING ON. SPECIFICALLY AND TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION- AND IN TERMS OF THE PROCEEDINGS I WOMAN I WILL AS THE PERSON A PERSON THAT HAS THE PROCEEDINGS- ASSIGNED TO ME- I'LL MAKE SURE THAT IT SAYS- EXPEDITED AS POSSIBLE THE ONE THING THAT IS DIFFICULT IS ARE NOT DIFFICULT THE ONE THING THAT IS CHALLENGING IN TERMS OF X. EXPEDITING- ACTIVITIES IS MAKING SURE THAT THERE'S PROPER DUE PROCESS AND THAT INCLUDES- THE DUE PROCESS FOR THOSE WE REGULATE AS WELL AS THE RATE PAYERS AND OF THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA SO WE WILL WE WILL EXPEDITE. OUR PROCEEDINGS AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND IN TERMS OF IMPLEMENTING WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THE THINGS THAT WE NEED AND THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT WILL HELP US. REGULATE THE INDUSTRY AND HAVE- PROPER OVERSIGHT OF THE INDUSTRY SO THAT THE THINGS THAT WE SAW THE HOT MESSAGE YOU WELL STATED DOESN'T OCCUR AGAIN A HOT MESS WILL MEAN THAT PEOPLE DO HAVE. THE ABILITY TO CALL NINE ONE ONE WHETHER THEIR WIRELESS OR. OUR LANDLINE YEAH IN IN I KNOW SO YOU WANT TO JUMP IN I THINK JUST BEING CANDID ABOUT IT. I HAVE SOME GREAT CONCERN. ABOUT BACKUP POWER UHHUH AND WHEN WE HAD FOREIGN FIFTY FOUR FOLK FOREIGN FIFTY FOUR THOUSAND FOLKS WHO RELIED ON CABLE PHONE SERVICE OR LAND LINE OUT THIS YEAR. GETTING TO WHERE CENTER DOLLY WAS MENTIONING MENDOCINO COAST THEY CAN CALL IN AND ONE ONE. NOW AND I HAVE GREAT CONCERN- BOTH ON HOW FAST IS TAKEN ACT IN HOW FAST TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND CABLE CAN ACT THAT WE MAY BE IN STORE FOR THE SAME THING THIS YEAR. I THINK WE NEED TO GET OUR ACT TOGETHER TO BE ON THE MOVE ON THAT. AND IT'S GOING TO TAKE TIME TO BE ABLE TO DO THE BACKUP POWER- WHEN IT COMES TO CELL TOWERS. AND I DON'T HAVE A CONFIDENCE INDUSTRIES GONNA MOVE WITHOUT A MANDATE. BECAUSE WHAT WE SAW IN AND THIS IS A QUESTION OF SAVE FOR THEIR DIRECTOR MUNCIE SERVICES. EVEN SURE INCE'S THIS SUMMER. AS IN YOU KNOW THIS THAT THE WORST CASE SCENARIO WOULDN'T HAPPEN WE WERE AND THE HIGHER TO MY BEING PRESIDENT RIGHT YES THEY WERE TELECOMMUNICATION COMPANIES LITERALLY HAD TO DRIVE HUNDREDS OF GENERATORS IN FROM TEXAS. TRY TO KEEP CALIFORNIA UP AND RUNNING AND IT DIDN'T WORK BUT SO I BRING ALL THIS UP THESE. I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. HOW THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO MOVE ON WHAT. YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT PRIOR TO THE SEASON AND I THINK WHO IS BEING HONEST ABOUT IT NOT AT ALL I TRY TO BE DIFFICULT BUT I THINK IT'S CAN BE CHALLENGING FOR YOU TO DO SO. AND THAT MEANS. WE GOT TO MOVE. WE HAVE TO BE HONEST WITH. CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS ABOUT. WHAT CHANGE THEY'RE GONNA SEE THIS YEAR AND I THINK WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO. COME UP WITH THAT- HARD. LINE MESSAGE ABOUT WHAT CHANGES ARE GOING TO SEE. I UNDERSTAND YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO DO THAT NOW. BUT I KNOW MISTER CHAIR THAT'S WHAT I'M INTERESTED FROM THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. I AND I KNOW YOU MAY HAVE FUTURE HEARING ANNUAL HEARING OVERSIGHT HEARING. AND HOPEFULLY YOU'RE GONNA BE OUR ADDRESS THAT WHEN YOU COME BACK. ON WHAT CALIFORNIA'S CAN SEE PRIOR TO THIS. FIRE SEASON FROM PC. SWISHER OF YET TO THE- CENTER OF OUR JUST WANNA COMMENT ABOUT THE EXPEDITING OF PROCEEDINGS IT'S- I THANK YOU FOR PRESIDENT PATCHER THAT THAT'S A CENTRAL. FOCUS OF HERS TO GET THINGS DONE MORE QUICKLY. I UNDERSTAND IT'S A CENTRAL CONCERN OF THIRD LEGISLATURE HAS BEEN FOR SOME TIME. I WILL SAY WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO QUICKLY RESOLVE. MANY PROCEEDINGS RELATED TO WHILE FOR MATTERS AS MANDATED BY SB NINE A ONE AND A. B. TEN FIFTY FOUR. INCLUDING PER APPROVING THE WHILE FOR MITIGATION PLANS WITHIN A SIX MONTH PERIOD. THE PRECEDING THAT PRESIDENT PATCHES TALKING ABOUT THE- P. S. P. S. PROCEEDING WE HAD AN EARLIER PHASE THAT WAS RESOLVED WITHIN SIX MONTHS. WE ARE PROCEEDING PROVIDING EMERGENCY CONSUMER PROTECTIONS THAT WAS RESOLVED QUICKLY. WE'VE IMPLEMENTED SEVERAL. VERSIONS OF OUR COUPLE PROVISIONS OF TEN FIFTY FOUR ALREADY SO THERE. IS A SENSE OF URGENCY ABOUT THESE PARTICULAR PROCEEDINGS AND THESE PROCESSES. AND THE NEED TO RESOLVE THEM QUICKLY WE CAN WE HAVE STATUTORY LIMITS. LIMITS. TO ENSURE THAT WE COMPORT TO COMPORT WITH DUE PROCESS BUT WE ARE TRUE. WITHIN THOSE CONSTRAINTS WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO RESOLVE THESE PROCEEDINGS VERY QUICKLY MR MY LAST QUESTION IS A SIMPLE ONE- THANK YOU SO MUCH SCRIPTURE AND MANY PRESENT WHEN DO YOU THINK THAT YOU CAN BE MORE SPECIFIC. ON WHAT CALIFORNIANS CAN EXPECT PRIOR TO A CALL POWER SHUT OFF SEASON IF YOU WILL- WAS AT SIXTY DAYS. NINETY DAYS WHAT'S YOUR GOTTEN ALL. BACK TO THIS YEAR. I WILL BE AS SPECIFIC AS I CAN. THAT IT NOT TO BE BUREAUCRATIC BUT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WERE LIMITED TO IS IN A PROCEEDING I CAN'T PREJUDGE IT ON I WOULD BE IN TROUBLE WITH ALL OF YOU IF I DID THAT SO- I WILL BE AS OPEN AND FORTHCOMING- UNDER THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE UC IF I COULD TAKE THE WIND AND WAVE IT THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS WE WOULD DO DIFFERENTLY NOT ONLY IN THE TELE IT TELECOMMUNICATIONS WORLD BUT CERTAINLY IN ELECTRICITY WORLD. WE DON'T HAVE. WE ARE THE REGULATORS WERE NOT THE IMPLEMENTOR- AS I HAVESAID TO THEM THERE AS I'VE SAID TO THE IOP IS IT'S NOT ABOUT THEIR PLANS IT'S ABOUT THEIR OUTCOMES WE CAN'T DRIVE THEIR OUTCOMES BUT WE CAN CERTAINLY REGULATE THAT TO BETTER OUTCOMES. AND I WOULD SAY THE SAME IN THE TELCO WORLD. THANK YOU SENATOR A STERN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR LIKE A MY COLLEAGUES REMARKS CREDITING YOUR LEADERSHIP HERE STAYING VIGILANT EVEN THOUGH WE'RE THROUGH HOPEFULLY THE WORST OF IT. THANK YOU ALSO PRESENT BADGER- GETTING BURNISHED THROUGH FIRE HERE- IN A VERY REAL WAY IN YOUR FIRST FEW MONTHS. TWO TWO QUESTIONS ONE IS POINT A CLARIFICATION CORRECTION OFTEN. IT YOU TALKED ABOUT THE ANALYSIS OF THE DATA YOU'VE COLLECTED GOING THROUGH THE VARIOUS TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROVIDERS AND THERE WOULD YOU CALM THEIR RESTORATION RATES THE PERCENTAGES THAT YOU TICKED OFF FIRST CAN YOU GO BACK THROUGH WOMEN AND JUST. WHAT WHAT DO THEY MEAN IS THAT. HOW HOW QUICKLY THEY'RE ABLE TO RESTORE SERVICE WITHIN A GIVEN PERIOD OF TIME OR OR IS IT. ABOUT THE SORT OF I KNOW THERE'S THE WE'RE GONNA HEAR DATA ALSO FROM THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS FOLKS BUT WE WHERE THEY'VE GOT BACK UP GENERATION ON WHICH SITES AT CETERA BUT JUST. RUN THAT BACK THROUGH S THE CENTER STERN. ONE OF THE METRICS IS THE AMOUNT OF TIME. THAT CERTAIN THAT SERVICES OUT AND HOW LONG IT TAKES TO RESTORE THE SERVICE. AND WE HAVE A REQUIREMENT THAT CARRIERS RESTORE 90% OF SERVICE OUTAGES FOR REGULAR TELEPHONE SERVICE. WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS OR LESS ON THE STATEWIDE AVERAGE. IT'S A WIN USE I FORGET EXACTLY THE PERCENTAGES WERE 56% FOR AT AND T. OR 48% FOR THE WHAT IS THAT THAT PERTAINS TO THAT PERTAINS TO THEIR ABILITY TO. RESTORE SERVICE WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS ON THE STATEWIDE AVERAGE SHOT IT SO ROUGHLY HALF FOR SO OR SOME A LITTLE MORE THAN HAVE SOME LESS THAN HALF FOR EIGHT ARE ABLE TO. MEET THAT REQUIREMENT ACROSS THEIR NETWORK. THAT'S CORRECT THEY WERE ABLE THEY WERE UNABLE TO RESTORE SERVICE WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS IN. IN IN FOR A 52% OF THE CASES IN EIGHTEEN T. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN FOR EXAMPLE. THERE'S AT THE WEB VERGE FOR SERVICE WAS SORREL. IN WHICH THEY WERE ABLE TO DO WAS 48% SO IS THAT LIMITED JUST TO ACQUIRE LISTS OR- IS THAT ALSO INCLUDE. VOICE OVER IP THIS IS DOES THE TRICK IN ALL THE LAND MINES JUST FOR LAND I GOT IT SO I'M ONE OF THOSE CUSTOMERS THAT. IS NOW MAYBE IN THE PURVIEW OF PC'S- WORK GOING FORWARD ALTHOUGH I KNOW I WOULD NOTE THAT ELEVEN THINGS ELEVEN SIXTY ONE A LOT FOR THE MONITORING OF. VOICE SERVICES SO I STILL. EVEN UNDER PRESSURE PRIOR LIFE IT SEEMS LIKE THERE WAS A ABILITY COLLECT SOME DATA BUT DO YOU ANTICIPATE AND I'M ON THE FOLKS WHO WOKE UP TO A FIRE IN THEIR BACKYARD- HAVE A WEEK FOR MY WEAPON. WHATEVER YOU KNOW YOU PLAN AROUND THOSE THINGS YOU WAKE UP TO SMOKE I HAVE NO CELL PHONE RECEPTION ON THE MOUNTAIN ROAD I'M ON. BUT THE LOOK THEY GET MY CAR AND GET OUT OF THERE- NOT EVERYONE IS AS LUCKY. AND HAS THOSE FACULTIES OUR ABILITIES- AND MY VOICE OVER IP SERVICE WAS DOWN. SO DO YOU NEED MORE THORNY FROM US TO COLLECT THE DATA REQUIRED IS SORT OF IDENTIFY THE VULNERABLE. SPOTS WITHIN THE NETWORKS BOTH ON I. P. LANDLINE AND WIRELESS OR DO YOU NEED EXIT. ADDITIONAL STATUTORY AUTHORITY THING TO GO. AT LEAST AT LEAST ASSESS THE RISK AS ACCURATELY AS POSSIBLE AND IS GRANULAR LEE AS WE NEED TO. MEET ALL THESE CONCERNS AS SENATOR STERN. ONE OF THE MAJOR IMPEDIMENTS TO OUR ABILITY TO COLLECT DATA WAS SECTION SEVEN TEN. BECAUSE THE INDUSTRY ARGUED REPEATEDLY AND FREQUENTLY THAT WE HAD NO AUTHORITY OVER VOIP OR I. P. SERVICES AND SO THEREFORE WE HAVE NO RIGHT TO COLLECT THE DATA WE DISAGREED WITH THAT ASSESSMENT NONE THE LESS IT WAS A ROAD BLOCK FREQUENTLY NOW THAT SEVEN TEN IS. A SUNSET IT OPENS THE OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO BE MORE. AGGRESSIVE IN SEEKING DATA AND HOPEFULLY GETTING IT. AT LAST QUESTION IS. WERE FOCUSED IN TELECOMMUNICATIONS OUTAGES. BACKUP POWER ISSUES BUT GOOD TAKING US BACK TO THE FALL AND OUR LAST OVERSIGHT HEARING YOU A BETTER SENSE NOW ON TIMING FOR THE ROOT CAUSE BUT WHAT I WOULD. ABOUT HIS ROUTE BECAUSE THE ROOT CAUSE WHICH CLIMATE CHANGE THEN WE GET TO PS PS HOW CAN WE MEDICAID AT LEAST THAT RISK THE P. S. P. S. RISK WHERE. FRANKLY BLIGHTED TELCO FOLKS EVEN GOT HAD FAKED- ABOUT WHERE WAS GOING TO BE AND THEY THEY PUT ASSETS TO THE WRONG PLACES- SOME IT WAS OUT OF THEIR HANDS. HOW FAR ALONG ARE YOU IN- LAYING OUT THOSE NEW YOU MENTION YOUR NEW PROTOCOLS ARE YOUR NEW REQUIREMENTS WHAT WERE WE IN THAT PROCESS AND IN AND OUT. THANK YOU MISTER THANK YOU SENATOR WERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT PROCEEDING BUT ON I HAVE. IN BOTH IT IS IT TOO HEARINGS IN NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER MENTION THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO DO. IS THE I'LL HAVE TO BETTER COMMUNICATE WITH THE TELCOS. A TWO YEAR VERY POINT. TELL BECAUSE DIDN'T INFORMATION IN SOME CASES IT'S COMES VERY LATE. ANY NINE ON HOW THE PS PS IS ADMINISTERED. AND ADMINISTER THEM DIFFERENTLY ASIAN NOW- IT. ONE OF THE I USE FOR EXAMPLE DOESN'T REALLY- DECIDE WHEN THE PSP IS GONNA CURRENT TELL- LESSON IN SOME CASES COUPLE HOURS BEFORE. SO THAT DOES PUT. DIFFICULTIES ON- THE TELCOS FOR EXAMPLE AND WHERE THEY NEED TO DEPLOY GENERATORS FOR EXAMPLE THAT WAS TALKED ABOUT EARLIER BY SENATOR MCGUIRE. BUT. SO ONE OF THE THINGS I DID WANT TO MENTION IN TERMS OF TIMING- WE'D JUST YESTERDAY STARTED GETTING BACK- THE- PARTIES TO THE PROCEEDINGS- THAT I MENTIONED IN MY TESTIMONY THE DEVELOPING OF THE REQUIREMENTS FOR RESILIENCY INDEPENDENT. A DEPENDABLE COMMUNICATIONS GRID OF FOR FURTHER SO WE CAN FURTHER ADDRESS A COMMUNICATION OUT JUST DURING A MARCH THE WE JUST. THE DEADLINE FOR THOSE COMMENTS WAS YESTERDAY SO STAFF IS JUST NOW GOING THROUGH THOSE COMMENTS WHICH WILL HELP. FOR ME AND THE A. L. J. INFORM THE SCOPE IN MEMEL WHICH WILL INDEED COM MISTER CHAIRMAN IMMEDIATELY. AND SENATOR I THINK BLANK MY COLLEAGUE COMMISSIONER REX OFTEN DID YOU WANT TO KNOW OKAY SORRY CENTER DOT. YEAH NUMBER MY QUESTIONS OF ALREADY BEEN ASKED- ANSWERED SO I APPRECIATE- MY COLLEAGUES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN FOR HOLDING THIS HEARING FIRST I DO I DO WANT TO MAKE CLEAR BECAUSE I THINK IT'S FAIR. THAT THE- THE TELECOMS AT LEAST IN THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN FIRES- IN THE NORTH BAY WERE EMBEDDED IN EVERY EMERGENCY- MEETING NOT THAT I WAS PLEASED WITH THE RESULTS. BUT THEY WERE THERE THEY WERE THERE ON THE GROUND THEY WERE DOING EVERYTHING THEY CAN. AND I THINK THAT WE- HELLO. IT'S BEEN MET. WHO'S AT FAULT HERE AND THE OF THIS OLD. HILL WE'VE ALL TALKED ABOUT TE NEW NORMAL A NEW PARADIGM. I DON'T KNOW FOR EXAMPLE IN LOCAL COMMUNITIES WE BLAME FIRST RESPONSE AND WHAT'S HAPPENED. I DON'T KNOW WHO COULD FOR SEEING. ALL THESE CATACLYSMIC EVENTS THAT THE STATE IS- FACED OVER THE LAST THREE TO THE THREE TO FOUR YEARS. YES SERIOUSLY IT'S IT IT'S SOMETHING THAT. SO I DON'T KNOW EVEN THE TELECOMS EVER THOUGHT ABOUT SEVENTY TWO HOURS OF BACKUP POWER FOR EXAMPLE- TO HELP COMMUNITIES WHAT ONE THING FOR SURE I REALLY DO BELIEVE THAT- WHEN THIRTY THREE COUNTIES ARE ALL SUDDEN CUT OFF- I DON'T THINK THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANY COULD EVER UNDERSTOOD. YOU KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON WITH P. DECISIONS THE POWER OFF SO MANY COUNTIES ALL ONCE I THINK THOUGH THAT THAT GET OUT OF JAIL FREE CARD- IS IT IS MAY BE NECESSARY IN SOME RESPECTS WITH THE TELECOMS- I THINK THEY NEED TO BE PUT ON NOTICE THAT. THIS IS A PARTNERSHIP FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR ALL OUR RESPECTIVE TAXPAYERS AND THEY'VE GOT TO STEP UP TO THE TAPE PLATE THEY'VE GOT TO START IVING US THE INFORMATION THEY'VE GOT A QUICK PLAY DEFENSE AUDIO ON THE ACT IT LEAST ON THAT- THE ASPECT. I GUESS ON THE ENERGY THEY WHAT WHAT ONE OF THE THINGS I KNOW THAT WE GOT COMPETING GOALS WE TALK ALL THE TIME ABOUT WE NEED MORE OF RURAL. INTERNET SERVICE IN THEM. BUT WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ALSO. YOU'RE KEEPING THIS LAND LINE FOREVER LET ME TELL YOU MY WIFE IS A PROPONENT OF KEEPING THE LAND LINE FOR EVER. DID YOU KNOW I JUST THINK IT'S FRANKLY RIDICULOUS BUT THAT'S- THAT THAT'S SOMETHING. HAPPY WIFE HAPPY LIFE SHOULD HAVE IT. THE CALLER RIGHT NOW WITH THE LISTENING TO THE HEARING. BUT THAT SAID. WE REALLY DO HAVE TO DISCUSS THESE OR INVESTMENT GOING TO BE IN THE LAND LIGHTING KEEPING THE LAN LINE FOR EVER OR ARE WE GOING TO DEMAND THE INVESTMENTS IN RURAL AREAS FOR THE INTERNET AND COMMUNICATIONS SERVICE AND I THINK THAT THESE THESE ISSUES GET CONFLATED ALL THE TIME AND WE'RE ASKING FOR INVESTMENTS IN BOTH YEAH THERE WAS SUCH A THING AS A TRACK- TAPE CASSETTE TAPES YOU KNOW THEY WERE VIDEO STORES AT ONE POINT IN TIME YOU KNOW TECHNOLOGY CHANGES. PEOPLE NEED TO CHANGE- I DON'T HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS HERE BUT THE I THINK THAT'S UP WE NEED TO CONSIDER AS POLICY MAKERS AND I WILL BE ASKING YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ARE ON THAT BUT MORE TARGETED YOU DID MENTION- THE- THE COMMUNICATION SERVICE PROVIDERS ARE TREATED SHOULD BE TREATED AS PUBLIC SAFETY PARTNERS DURING PS PSP EVENTS SB NINE OH ONE REQUIRED THAT. IT ALSO- CODE SECTION EIGHTY EIGHTY THREE EIGHTY SIX YEAH SAID CONSIDER PUBLIC SAFETY IMPACTS ON COMMUNICATION INFRASTRUCTURE IT ALSO SAID INCLUDE PROCEDURES FOR DIRECT NOTIFICATION OF OPERATORS OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE IT'S SO I GUESS MY QUESTION IS ALSO WHAT IS THE C. P. SEAT- GONNA DO IN THAT REGARD TO MAKE SURE THAT THE I. O. U.'S. IS SPECIFICALLY. FOR ME P. JEANNIE OR TREATING COMMUNICATIONS SERVICE PROVIDERS AS PUBLIC SAFETY PARTNERS IN PROVIDING PRIORITY NOTICE A PS BSE DEBTS. WE CERTAINLY RAISED THAT DIRECTLY WITH THE I. O. U.'S- I HAVE IN IN THE HEARINGS THAT I HELD AFTER- THE OCTOBER NOVEMBER EVENT DIRECTLY WITH P. JEANNIE THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS MISSING WAS THE COMMUNITY. THE PROPER COMMUNICATION WITH THE TELCO COMPANIES- AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO- AS WE GO THROUGH OUR PS PS- PROCEEDING WE WILL CONTINUE TO HIGHLIGHT AND HOLD ACCOUNTABLE. AS THE REGULATOR THE I. O. U.'S. I THINK THE ALLEN WANTED TO ANNOUNCE AN AS YET SOMETHING ON THE ON YOUR FIRST POINT YEAH CENTER I'M ONE OF THOSE DIE HARD LAND LINE. PHONE SERVICE PEOPLE AS WELL AS I SAY THEY'LL HAVE TO PRY IT OUT OF MY COLD DEAD FINGERS- BUT- I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE- ROBO CALLS. WELL THAT'S TRUE THERE IS AFTER YOU USE THE OLD FASHIONED ANSWERING MACHINE TO SCREEN THEM OUT. BY. I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THE TRADITIONAL WIRELINE TECHNOLOGY THAT THAT THAT IS THE UNDERLYING TECHNOLOGY PROVIDING THAT PHONE SERVICE TO YOUR HOUSE AND TO MINE IS ALSO RELYING ON FIND MANY- SERVICES. FOR THAT HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE LAND LINE PHONE SERVICE GOING YOUR HOUSE THERE ARE IT'S ESSENTIAL TO MANY SERVICES THAT ARE START ARE PROVIDED THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND- SO DO WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE. THAT PHONE SERVICE TO EVERYBODY IN EVERY REMOTE AREA THAT IS A POLICY QUESTION THE COMMISSION WILL HAVE TO LOOK AT ME WITH THE LEGISLATURE AS WELL DO WE NEED TO MAINTAIN THAT TECHNOLOGY FOR SOME INDEFINITE PERIOD OF TIME IN ORDER TO PROVIDE THAT FOR SERVICES THAT DEPEND ON IT THAT- SOMETHING OTHER THAN YOUR PHONE IN MIND. YES THAT IS GOING TO HAVE TO CONTINUE BECAUSE SO MUCH DEPENDS ON IT AND THE NETWORK IS ALL INTER WOVEN SO NOT EITHER OR NO IT'S NOT EITHER OR- THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR MUCH SOONER HERTZBERG. THANK YOU. MY IS REALLY MORE OF A COMMENT IN TERMS OF THE LARGER PICTURE I TAKE MY GUIDANCE FROM MY RECENT RE READING OF CITIZENS AT ALL AND- THE BIG PICTURE THINK IF YOU WILL AYE AYE HE- THERE ARE GOVERNMENT A LONG TIME. AND MARBLE BOETTCHER IS PROBABLY THE BEST PUBLIC SERVANT I'VE EVER MET WHETHER IT'S IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OTHER STATES THIS STATE PRIVATE SECTOR. EXTRAORDINARY AND I WAS STROKES ECSTATIC WHEN YOU BECAME THE PRESIDENT OF THIS ORGANIZATION BUT I. DIGITAL WORRIED THAT- YOU'RE THE PRESIDENT OF CALIFORNIA PHOTO MATCH. IN THE SENSE THAT AND YOU KIND OF TALKED ABOUT IT IN THE SENSE THAT. EVERYBODY HERE IS TRYING TO SOLVE A PROBLEM. THE ANALYSIS TALKS ABOUT OPPORTUNITIES TO RENT AND LIMIT THE CURRENTS AND IMPACT FUTURE OUTAGES WHICH IS WHAT WE'RE ABOUT. YOUR TESTIMONY YOU TALKED ABOUT. WE HAVE PROCEEDINGS I CAN'T TALK ABOUT IT BECAUSE IT'S PREJUDICE BECAUSE MIGHT BE PREJUDICED THE PROCEEDING. IN OTHER WORDS. THE RAILROAD COMMISSION WHICH IS WHAT YOU RUN BASICALLY. AND I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS IN HEARINGS FOR MANY YEARS. IT'S JUST YESTERDAY'S NEWS AND PROCTER OF IT IN TERMS OF YOU'VE GOT THIS NEW DYNAMIC OF A NEW WORLD ORDER THINGS THAT WE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT CENTER BRADFORD TALKING ABOUT TWO THOUSAND TEN WE CAN USE SO MANY EXAMPLES THROUGHOUT HISTORY. OF WHAT WE SOUGHT TO DO THE ENERGY CRISIS EXAMPLE AFTER EXAMPLE. I'M JUST FEARFUL THAT WE HAVE GOOD PEOPLE OF GOOD WILL AROUND THIS DíAS PEOPLE OF GOOD WILL IN THE MINISTRATION TRYING TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM BUT WE ARE TRYING TO. SOLVE THE PROBLEM WITH PHOTO MATT BLOCKBUSTER AND A DIAL NOTARY PHONE. AND THE REALITY IS THAT IF AT THE END OF THE DAY THE QUESTION SHOULD BE NOT WHETHER WE'RE GOING TO PENALIZE PEOPLE MORE OR WILL WE COLLECT DATA I HEAR THE STORIES ABOUT DATA. AND SAYING OKAY WE'RE GONNA PASS A BILL THAT WE CAN COLLECT DATA TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND BY THE TIME WE GET TO THE THAT'S TWENTY TWENTY TWO. AND THEN WE'RE GONNA DO THIS AND THEN WE'RE GONNA START PROCEEDING. THE REALITY IS WE HAVE TO AS IN OUR SYSTEM AS- PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES TO BE PAPA PAGE TO PREVENT AND LIMIT OCCURRENCES IMPACT FUTURE AT FUTURE OUTAGES. THE QUESTION IS CAN WE STEP BACK FOR A MOMENT. AND LOOK AT THE NEW WORLD ORDER THAT WE LIVE IN THE NEW DYNAMIC WE HAD ALWAYS PRIVACY DISCUSSIONS WITH SENATOR. JACKSON ABOUT ALL THE CREEPY STUFF THAT GOES ON. IN THE PRIVACY WORLD THERE'S SO MANY FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES I MEAN THIS WHOLE TELEPHONE BUSINESS. YOU KNOW I STILL HAVE A ROTARY PHONE. IT'S IN MY MUSEUM BUT I DON'T USE IT BUT THE POINT IS THAT I MEAN MEMBERS THE KIDS SO. THE QUESTION IS WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE AND I'M JUST A LITTLE AFRAID THAT THIS CONVERSATION IS INFORMED BY THE ECONOMY. ON THE ONE HAND THE SURPLUS OF URGENCY. THAT ALL OF US ARE HONORABLY INFORMED BY EVERYONE OF US EVERY ONE OF THE PEOPLE THAT WORK FOR YOU. ON THE ONE HAND AND ON THE OTHER HAND ALL AND EVEN THOUGH THIS OLD CRUSTY MODEL THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE THE PROCEEDINGS. AND HEARINGS AND A. L. JAY'S. ALL THIS GARBAGE THAT WORK WHEN WE HAD A RAILROAD AND A DIFFERENT WORLD. BUT I'M NOT SO SURE THAT IF THE CHIEFS THE DELIVERABLES SO I'M JUST WORRIED THAT WE'RE BUILDING ON QUICKSAND. AND THAT WE'RE BUILDING ON IT YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE ALL CRAMMING. FORMAT SHOPS AND TRYING TO FIX THAT PROBLEM RATHER THAN STEPPING BACK FOR A MOMENT BE INFORMED BY THE CHALLENGE WHAT'S THE PROBLEM WE'RE TRYING TO SOLVE. AND THEN THINKING THROUGH NOT BEING LIMITED BY THE STRUCTURE. BECAUSE I THINK WHAT'S HAPPENING IS THIS DESTRUCTIVE DISCUSSION I LOVE WHEN USED TO IT I CAN'T TALK ABOUT THE PROCEEDINGS BECAUSE I GET PRE JUDGE. WE TALKS ABOUT YOU KNOW I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE A MAGIC WAND. MY QUESTION IS I WROTE DOWN GIVE YOU A MAGIC WAND. I TRUST YOU EXCELLENT WHAT'S THE MAGIC WAND BUT THE MAGIC ON TO ME IS NOT INFORMED BY THE D. THOUGH GIVING MORE AUTHORITY THE IDEAS THE TALKED ABOUT NEW AUTHORITY OVERSIGHT AND PENALTIES THAT YESTERDAY'S NEWS THIS IS THE NEW TECHNOLOGY IS GOING TO BE GONE AND OUT THE DOOR BEFORE WE IN IMPLEMENT A REGULATIONS LET'S FIGURE OUT WHAT THAT NEW WORLD ORDER LOOKS LIKE THAT WE CAN GIVE YOU THAT MAGIC WAND SO THAT WE PROMOTE INNOVATION PROMOTE EQUITY AND FAIRNESS AND TAKE CARE OF THE RULE PEOPLE IN ALL THE OTHER CHALLENGE THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH. AND THAT'S WHAT I DO SO BUT I WANT TO SUGGEST TONIGHT OBVIOUSLY HAVE NO ANSWER I JUST WANTED TO POSE IT TO TRY TO INFORM CALIFORNIA THIS GREAT PLACE OF CALIFORNIA THIS PLACE IF YOU READ CITIZENS BILL IS ALL ABOUT THE FUTURE I GOT UP TO CUBA ON MY WALL AND I WAS JUST CALL THE NEW SOME TEQUILA HE WAS CALLED THE OLD ONE SAID WHEN HE WAS LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR IT'S AT THE NEW ONE SAYS FUTURE MAN THE FUTURE ME. THANKS TO TALKING ABOUT THE FUTURE COSTS NOW I WANT TO TRY TO ENGAGE THAT OUR DISCUSSION AS WE THINK THROUGH GOING SPORT THANK YOU. IN A ROOM. THROW SOME. ALSO YOU MAKE REFERENCE TO SOME OF THE COMMENTS MADE HERE SO I'M SORRY BECAUSE I THINK YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT IT BUT I JUST KIND OF WANT TO BRING IT BACK TO US AT THE MENTION THE REPORT THAT I HAVE YOU BEEN BREAKING DOWN A LITTLE BIT THROUGHOUT IT YOU CALLED AT THE NET NETWORK EXAMINATION REPORT I WANT TO JUST FOCUS A LITTLE BIT MORE ON THAT IF YOU CAN AND OPERATE. FIRST OF ALL WANT TO KNOW IT'S A PUBLIC DOCUMENT THAT WE CAN REVIEW SECONDLY ARE YOU CREATING A STRATEGIC PLAN TO TACKLE ALL THE FINDINGS IN THAT REPORT I WANT TO KNOW LONG TERM SHORT TERM GOALS ON AND IT GOES BACK TO- WHAT SENATOR HERTZBERG WAS TALKING ABOUT I WANT TO KNOW THAT THERE'S IMMEDIATE ACTION TO ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE ISSUES BECAUSE HE'S RIGHT IN THAT WE HAVE INFORMATION AND THEN IT KIND OF GOES. IT TAKES A LONG TIME TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES IN MY TIME WE GET TO THEM IT'S ALREADY A NEW ISSUE VERSUS THE OLD ISSUE SO CAME TO SHARE A LITTLE BIT OF HARD GONNA TACKLES FINDINGS AND NOW REPORTED IT CAN WE HAVE ACCESS TO IT THANK YOU SENATOR THE WE RELEASED A SUMMARY AND REDACTED PORTIONS OF THE REPORT THOSE OR A WEBSITE OF COURSE WILL WILL. BE HAPPY SHERRY SHARE THEM WITH YOU WE'VE BEEN IN A FIGHT OVER THE PAST SEVERAL MONTHS WITH EIGHTEEN T. IN FRONT HERE OVER MAKING THE REQUEST OF THE PUBLIC THEY BOTH FIRED OF CONFIDENTIALITY CLEAN WHICH WE WERE QUITE BEING BUT WE WERE REQUIRED BY STATUTE I WHO DETERMINE WHAT THE TO CONFIDENTIAL FOR YOU. WITH THAT. CLAIM IS DOING. PORT SHOULD BE MADE PUBLIC. THE FINDINGS IN SUMMARY OUR ON OUR WEBSITE SO WITH STRIVING TO MAKE IT PUBLIC AS QUICKLY AS WE CAN. IN OUR INTENT IS TO DO JUST WHAT YOU SAID TO FOLLOW UP. ON THE- FIND OUT OF RECOMMENDATIONS AND TO GO THROUGH OUR PROCESS. AND FOR DETERMINE WHAT SPORT WHAT STEPS DO WE NEED TO TAKE TO WE NEED TO CHANGE THE EXISTING SERVICE QUALITY RULES WE HAVE THREE MAJOR RULES THAT I MENTIONED ARE THEY ENOUGH TO THEY NEED TO BE STRENGTHENED DO THEY NEED TO BE EXTENDED TO DIFFERENT SERVICE PROVIDERS WE HAVE A SCHEME. IN PLACE FOR PENALIZING. VIOLATIONS IS THAT THE RIGHT SCHEMES IS THE- MORE PENALTIES APPROPRIATE OR ARE. THE OTHERS ARE THIS THE OF A FOCUSED ON THE RIGHT AREAS AND SO FORTH AND SO ON. AND WE WILL. WE WILL MOVE EXPEDITIOUSLY IN THAT AREA. THE WE ARE STILL TAKING ACTION TO TRY TO BRING THE CARRIERS INTO COMPLIANCE. AND NOT WITHSTANDING THE FACT THAT THIS NETWORK EXAMINATION HAS NOT BEEN PUBLICIZED. THE TWO FILE QUARTERLY REPORTS AS I MENTIONED AND IF THEY'RE OUT OF COMPLIANCE THE TO EITHER PAY OF A PENALTY OR MAKE A AND INVESTMENT TWICE THE AMOUNT OF PENALTY IN LIEU OF THAT. THAT FIGHT. THANK YOU AND THE REASON I'M A LITTLE FRUSTRATED BECAUSE AS YOU CAN HEAR EVERYONE UP HERE IS REALLY WANTS TO BE HELPFUL AND FIND SOLUTIONS ALONG WITH YOU ON THE CARRIERS BUT- ALMOST FEELS LIKE WE HAVE PIECES OF INFORMATION RACES THAT. THE WHOLE PIECE AND WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE SOMEHOW FIND THAT FULL PICTURE SO THAT WE CAN MOVE FORWARD SOME POLICY WHERE WE CAN BE HELPFUL TO YOU BUT- THANK YOU FOR SHARING THAT I JUST WANTED OF. CLARITY ON THAT IT WILL TAKE THEM HAVE THE MIKE THE CENTER HERTZBERG WE I- WE UNDERSTAND YOUR CONCERNS AND FRUSTRATIONS AND I KNOW YOU'VE HAD DIALOGUES WITH. OTHER COMMISSIONERS PRESIDENT PICKER ABOUT THIS ISSUE. WE HAVE BEEN ENGAGED IN AN EFFORT ADMINISTRATIVELY OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS THAT WE'RE CONTINUING TO TRY TO MAKE OUR PROCEEDINGS. QUICKER MORE EFFECTIVE MORE TRANSPARENT. WE'RE WE'RE PROPOSING A SET OF RULES CHANGES WE'VE HAD SOME WORKSHOPS ABOUT THAT RIGHT NOW. MUCH OF WHAT YOU TALK ABOUT THE MORE FUNDAMENTAL REFORMS NEED STATUTORY CHANGE. WITH THE KIDS TO BUT BY STATURE WE HAVE TO PROCEED IN THE WAY WE DO. SO WE WOULD WELCOME YOUR ENGAGEMENT AND HELP IN THAT AREA THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR HILL THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND LIKE THANK YOU TO MY COLLEAGUES FOR THE GREAT QUESTIONS TODAY HAD USE JUST. PHENOMENAL DISCUSSION AND THANK YOU PRESIDENT IN. AND COMMISSIONER FOR YOUR INVOLVEMENT ONE HERE LEADERSHIP BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S BEEN THE KEY. SINCE YOUR APPOINTMENTS- TO THE COMMISSION AND I THINK WE'VE ALL IS SENATOR HERTZBERG INDICATED. FEEL A SENSE OF RELIEF THAT THERE IS STRONG LEADERSHIP THERE THAT'S GOING TO TAKE US TO THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY AND BRING IT INTO THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY MADE. THE COMMENT AND SENATOR HERTZBERG AND- BECAUSE YOU JUST MADE THE ISSUE RAISED THE ISSUE OF. DUE PROCESS THE TIMELINESS OF PROCEEDINGS TO CHALLENGES AND I KNOW A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO I HAD. LEGISLATION DEALING WITH THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF SOME OF THE- REPORTS IN THE COMMISSION OF THE UTILITIES AND- THE TELECOMS AND HOW CHALLENGING THAT HAS BEEN. BECAUSE THEY CLAIM EVERYTHING IS CONFIDENTIAL AND THEN IT'S UP TO US TO FIGHT IN THE- THE CRIMINAL ASPECTS OF RELEASING THAT INFORMATION IS SOMETHING THAT WE TRIED TO CHANGE AS WELL. SO IDEA WHAT MY SUGGESTION IS AS YOU GO THROUGH THIS PROCESS WITH THE- THE LANDS OF EXPEDITING. AS BEST AS POSSIBLE BASED THE CONSTRAINT. IN THIS BUDGET TO. CONSTRUCT YOU HAVE. PLEASE CONFIRM. MAKE THOSE NOTES OF WHERE THOSE CHANGES WOULD BE MOST EFFECTIVE. TO BRING THE COMMISSION TO THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY TO THAT WE CAN DEAL ISSUES THAT WE HAVE. AND THEN COME TO THE BUDGET. AND WE'RE HAPPY TO SUPPORT. THOSE THOSE CHANGES MAKE THIS A MORE NIMBLE AND- FUNCTIONAL AGENCY THAT YOU HAVEN'T COMMISSION SO PLEASE. LET US KNOW. IF YOU NEED HELP WITH THAT WE WILL INDEED I. AM. AT AS I THINK OF THE SENATOR CENTER HERTZBERG- SORT OF ALLUDED TO I WILL NOT TAKE. THAT PHRASE I'M LESS OVERWHELMING TO ME THANK YOU AND I HOPE YOU CAN SAY IT SIX MONTHS FROM NOW TO. BUT IT IS A I WILL TELL YOU PERSONALLY IT'S BEEN AB AND I HAVEN'T. I HAVEN'T BEEN THROUGH A LOT OF THE AND PROCESSES YET. BUT IT WE DO OPERATE A PRETTY ARCHAIC SYSTEM AND- THANK GOODNESS TO COMMISSION WRECK SHAMAN AND COMMISSIONER RANDALL FOR DOING TACKLING SOME OF THE REFORMS THAT THEY'VE TACKLED. AND WE'RE STILL WORKING THROUGH THOSE AND I COMING OUT OF GOV OP SECRETARY GOV UPSETS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT GOVERNOR BROWN IT. AND ALSO- NEWSHAM A CHARGE ME WITH AMOUNTS REFORMING GOVERNMENT AND REALLY REFORM IN PROCESS THIS IS WHAT I ALWAYS USED TO SAY NOT MAKING THINGS MORE EFFICIENT BUT ACTUALLY REFORM IN THE PROCESS. IT'S WHAT I'VE- IT'S WHAT I'VE- REALLY DEVOTED A LOT OF MY PUBLIC SERVICE TO. SO I REALLY AGREE WITH- CENTER HERTZBERG- OBSERVATION THAT WE ARE REGULATOR REGULATING. FOR THE LAST CENTURY NOT THE CURRENT CENTURY. TO CHANGE THIS S. SPEAKING ABOUT PARTNERSHIPS TO CHECK MAKE THE CHANGES- TO THE PROCESS CITIES OF THE COMMISSION WILL TAKE ALL WILL TAKE A PARTNERSHIP THE P. C. THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE THE LEGISLATURE AND I AM LOOKING AT OUR OWN PROCESSES WHICH WE ARE DOING AND WE'VE ALREADY MADE SOME CHANGES- I THINK THAT CENTER RICKSHAW OF IT COMMISSION WRECK SHOT AND- MENTIONED EARLIER. THAT WE- THROUGH A VERY EXPEDITED PROCESS TO IMPLEMENT THE LAW A WILDFIRE AND PROTOCOLS FROM AND- TEN FIFTY FOUR AND NINE A ONE. AND WORK WERE GOING WHERE YOU IT AS OUT ROCK GOING WHERE WILL THEY WERE BROWN TYLER SO IF WE CAN TAKE GENERAC PORTABLES STOPPED HIM SORRY BUT NOW WE DO HAVE STILL MORE MEMBERS ON THE- KIßM SORRY IN A WORLD WILL. TAKE YOUR ANSWERS CENTER MONEY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN NO. WE'VE GOT MANY WAITING ON IMPORTANT PANEL IT WE HAVE A LONG AGENDA SO AND WE WILL HAVE THE PRAISES OF YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS AND DIRECT MY QUESTION. I THINK THE COMMISSIONERS COMMISSION MEMBERS FOR BEING HERE I THINK MY QUESTIONS PRIDE BEST DIRECTED- TO COMMISSIONER. WRECK SCHAFFEN- IT RELATES TO LAND LINES AND WHILE MANY I THINK FEEL. WE NEED TO MOVE FORWARD WITH NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND INVEST IN THE NEW TECHNOLOGIES I REPRESENT CONSTITUENTS WHO ARE DEPENDENT ON THEIR LAND LINE IT'S THEIR ONLY CONNECTION- IN TIMES OF EMERGENCY. AND OUR LAND LINE ACTUALLY WORKS WHEN WE LOSE OUR POWER SO WE CAN STILL MAKE A NINE ONE ONE CALL USING FIELD LAND LINE SO THERE'S A REDUNDANCY BENEFIT THEIR TO SOME CONSUMERS- DURING TIMES OF CRISIS MY QUESTION. YOU TALKED TO THERE'S A PATCHWORK AUTHORITY IN JURISDICTIONS AND PEOPLE ARE FIGHTING OVER THIS AUTHORITIES IN JURISDICTIONS IT SEEMS CLEAR THAT THE P. YOU SEE DOES HAVE AUTHORITY OVER LAND LINE REPORTING WHEN THERE IS A LOSS OF SERVICE THAT'S PART OF THE REPORTING OBLIGATION. AND TIME FOR RESTORATION. THIS P. UC'S AUTHORITY ALSO ALLOW WHEN THERE'S A SERIES OF SLOW RESPONSES TO REPLACING SERVICE. TO REQUIRE THE INVESTMENT INFRASTRUCTURE. TO SPEED CITY DON'T HAVE REPEATED LOSSES OF SERVICE EVERY TIME. THERE'S AN OUTAGE I WOULD SAY YES AND HELEN CAN CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG I WE HAVE THE MOST PLENARY THE CLEAREST AND MOST PLENARY THIRTY OVER THE TRADITIONAL LAND LINES SO IN OUR I WANT TO HEAR YOUR ANSWER TO. SO MY QUESTION GOES. IF A CERTAIN PROVIDE. TELECOM PROVIDER ON LAND IT'S LAND LINE SERVICE CONTINUES TO SHOW AN INABILITY TO RESTORE SERVICE. DOES THAT OF THE WORDING INCLUDE REQUIRING THAT THIS THERE'S INVESTMENT IN IN THE ACTUAL INFRASTRUCTURE- IF THEY'RE GIVING THAT IS THE REASON THAT THEY'RE LOSING THE SERVICE YES SENATOR ARE STARTING DOES INCLUDE THE ABILITY TO DO THAT TO REQUIRE THE CARE TO MAKE FURTHER INVESTMENT WE HAVE NOT DONE THAT FOR SOME YEARS BECAUSE OF THE WAY THEN. NETWORK HAS IF. IN BUT WE HAVE THAT AUTHORITY. BECAUSE I THINK ONE OF OUR DILEMMAS THANK YOU FOR THE ANSWER IS. THE TELECOM COMPANIES WANT TO INVEST IN THE FUTURE IN MORE. RADIO ERVICES- CELL TOWERS THAT CENTRO BIT THE PUBLIC SAFETY REQUIRES MAINTAINING THAT LAND LINE SERVICE. TO PEOPLE THAT ARE DEPENDENT PARTICULARLY FOR EMERGENCY RESPONSE SO I THINK THAT'S ONE OF OUR CHALLENGES AS PURCHASING THAT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I CAN CENTER MONEY NO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE AND THEIR TESTIMONY AND YOUR YOUR LAN ANSWERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO THE NEXT PANEL. WHICH LOOKS AT THE IMPACTS TO PUBLIC SAFETY AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE WE HAVE. MARK YOU ARE DO CHI HIS THE FROM THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES WITH STATE CALIFORNIA. WE ALSO HAVE CHRIS RILEY. HE IS- THE EMERGENCY SERVICES MANAGER WITH MARIN COUNTY. RIGHT AND IF THEY'RE BOTH PRESENT IF YOU COULD COME FORWARD. THANK YOU AND WELCOME BACK. PLEASE SIR PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE WHEN YOU'RE READY ALL RIGHT FULL GOOD MORNING EVERYONE- MISS CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANKS FOR HAVING ME HERE TO TALK ABOUT THE RESILIENCY OF OUR TELECOMMUNICATION SYSTEMS MARK RDG DIRECTOR OF THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES. LET ME START OFF BY SAYING THAT- THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS PATHWAYS OF TODAY THAT THOSE PATHWAYS WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT FOR THE WIRELESS AND INTERNET OF THINGS. HAVE EVOLVED TO BECOME VITAL COMPONENTS TO OUR STATE'S PUBLIC SAFETY SYSTEM. SO MANY OF THE COMPONENTS OF CALIFORNIA'S EMERGENCY RESPONSE OPERATIONS ARE BECOMING HEAVILY DEPENDENT UPON THESE CAPABILITIES AS SUCH ALERT MORNINGS SYSTEMS THAT ARE PROVIDING LIFESAVING NOTIFICATIONS TO THE PUBLIC AND INFORMATION SHARING AND DISSEMINATION CAPABILITIES THAT ALLOW FOR REAL TIME FLOW. OF DATA FROM THE FRONT LINES OF A DISASTER TO DECISION MAKERS. THE REALITY IS THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES THAT WE ARE DEPENDING ON WHETHER THROUGH VOICE OVER IP LAND LINE CELLPHONE TV OR COMPUTER ARE NOW REALLY ESSENTIAL AND CRITICAL LIFELINE SERVICES. YET AS A AND C. AND THE RELIABILITY OF THE SYSTEMS ARE INCONSISTENT OR SIMPLY ABSENT WITH WHAT IS NECESSARY TO ENSURE. THE DELIVERY OF THE ESSENTIAL LIFELINE CAPABILITIES. OVER THE LAST SIX YEARS WE KNOW WE'VE HAD NUMEROUS OCCASIONS WHERE NATURAL AND HUMAN CAUSED DISASTERS HAVE RESULTED IN FAIRS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THESE. AND I'VE TESTIFIED ON THE OF THE OF THE FINDINGS IN THE FACTUAL DATA THAT WE HAVE SEEN BUT I WANT TO LOOK FORWARD I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THAT TODAY I'LL SEND SOME CONTEXT. OF WHERE WE'RE TRYING TO GET TO- TO BE ABLE TO FRAME. FOR IN THE EFFORT. DURING THE TWO THOUSAND ON THE OCTOBER TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN PS PS ADVANCE. REALLY A WORST CASE SCENARIO EMERGED AS THE AS LARGE REGIONS OF THE STATE'S WERE DEALING. WITH THE MULTI DAY PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFFS COMBINED WITH A RED FLAG WHETHER. AND SEVERAL FIRES BROKE OUT. AS A ESULT OF THE OUTAGES HUNDREDS OF CELL SITES AND DATA LINES HAD LOST POWER. MOST WITH INSUFFICIENT BACKUP POWER OR NO BACKUP POWER AT ALL. MANY CALIFORNIANS WERE UNABLE TO COMMUNICATE GET INFORMATION ABOUT EVCUATION ROUTES OR OTHER LARGE OR RECEIVE UPDATES ON PS PS OR FIRE CONDITIONS. AND I WILL ONE CENTERS AND HOSPITALS WERE UNABLE TO PROCESS CRITICAL DATER OR LEVERAGE IMPORTANT RECORDS. TO AVOID REPEATING THE SCENARIO. OUR TELECOMMUNICATIONS PARTNERS BOTH WIRELESS AND CABLE NEED TO PERFORM WHAT I BELIEVE. AND I BELIEVE THERE ARE DOING THIS NOW A COMPREHENSIVE GAP ANALYSIS TO DEVELOP A STRATEGIC PLAN TO RAPIDLY BUILD IN BOTH RESILIENCY AND REDUNDANCY THROUGHOUT THEIR SYSTEM. WE BELIEVE THAT THE PROCESS OF UPGRADING THE SYSTEM TO WHAT I CALL PUBLIC SAFETY GRADE IS PRIMARILY TO FULL INCREASING DATA SHARING. AN INFRASTRUCTURE HARDENING. IN THE AREA OF DATA SHARING DURING DISASTERS LIKE TELECOMMUTE Là DURING DISASTERS THE- SERVICE PROVIDERS HOLD KEY INFORMATION CALAVERAS NEEDS IN ORDER TO EFFECTIVELY RESPOND TO EMERGENCIES. NO WE WENT AN OUTAGE OCCURS ENABLES- WE ASKED TO SHARE SUCH VALUABLE INFORMATION WITH RESPONSE AGENCIES IMPROVING THE ABILITY TO MAKE DECISIONS. WHICH ARE OFTEN LIFESAVING DECISIONS BASED ON THAT ACTIONABLE DATA THAT IS AVAILABLE. AT THE STATE LOCAL LEVEL RAPIDLY KNOWING WHEN AN OUTAGE HAS OCCURRED INCREASES SITUATIONAL AWARENESS AND FURTHER INFORMS AS WHEN ALTERNATE FORMS OF COMMUNICATION AND OR NOTIFICATIONS ARE NEEDED. ADDITIONALLY STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES CAN ASSESS WHETHER COMMUNITIES ARE AT RISK OF BEING UNABLE TO ACCESS NINE ONE ONE SERVICE AND THEN WE CAN IMPLEMENT APPROPRIATE COUNTERMEASURES OR TAKE YOU SEE BEING MANY. ACTIONS IN THE PAST. THE INFORMATION WE NEED HAS NOT BEEN EASILY OBTAINED FROM THE SERVICE PROVIDERS DURING THE RECENT. VAN WHAT ARE WHAT OVER THIRTY COUNTIES LOST POWER WE HAVE HAD DIFFICULTY GETTING REQUIRED INFORMATION FROM SEVERAL WIRELESS AND WIRELINE PROVIDERS. NOT LAUGHTER I PERSONALLY REACHED OUT TO THEIR RESPECTIVE CEOS WE ABLE TO GET THE DETAILS OUTAGE INFORMATION NEEDED THAT WAS ACTIONABLE AND RELEVANT. DURING THE OCTOBER TWENTY EIGHT PS PS A BAD FOR INSTANCE IT WAS REPORTED THAT THREE POINT 3% OF THE CELL TOWERS IN THE PS PS AREAS WENT DOWN. WHILE THE NUMBER DOES NOT SEEM SIGNIFICANT AT FIRST CONSIDER. THE LOCAL AREA SPECIFIC IMPACT ABOUT THREE POINT 3% RESIDENTS OF MARIN COUNTY AS YOU'VE HEARD LOS CELLULAR SERVICE AND WE'RE ABLE TO GET INFORMATION AS 57% OF THE COUNTY CELL TOWERS WENT OFFLINE. THIS WAS CHALLENGING. THE ENDING THE P. S. P. S. EVENT HOW DID THE INABILITY TO GET INFORMATION ESSENTIAL INFORMATION OUT BUT MARIN COUNTY WAS A RECEIVING AND SHELTERING COUNTY FOR CAN QUE FIRED BACK YOU WE SEE. THE LACK OF CELLULAR AND INTERNET SERVICES CRIPPLED ESSENTIAL COMMUNICATIONS EXPONENTIALLY COMPLICATING THE SITUATION. AT PUT RIGHT LIVES AT RISK. WITHOUT RAPIDLY RECEIVING DETAIL AREA SPECIFIC OUTAGE DATA CALLOW YES AND LOCAL AGENCIES CANNOT TAKE THE REQUIRED STEPS TO PUT ALTERNATE COMMUNICATIONS IN PLACE. TO ENSURE FOR PUBLIC SAFETY. THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES HOWEVER FOR IMPROVEMENT ALL AROUND. I'M HAPPY TO SAY THAT SERVICE PROVIDERS AND CAL WE **** HAVE BEEN MEETING OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS TO ASSESS GAPS AND DISCUSS IMPROVEMENTS THESE MEETINGS HAVE BEEN BENEFICIAL AND CONSTRUCTIVE AND WILL BE ON GOING. AS WELL SB SIX SEVENTY BY SENATOR MCGUIRE PASSED LAST YEAR INSIDE BY THE GOVERNOR SAYS FOR THE STARTING POINT FOR OUTAGE INFORMATION SHARING HELLO YES HAS RELEASED PROPOSED REGULATIONS FOR PUBLIC COMMENT THAT ESTABLISHES A REPORTING THRESHOLD AND THE PROCESS BY WHICH SERVICE PROVIDERS SHALL REPORT. HE DRAFT REGULATIONS WERE RELEASED FOR PUBLIC COMMENT ON DECEMBER TWENTIETH AND WILL BE OPEN UNTIL FEBRUARY FOURTH ANOTHER SOLUTION THAT CALLOW YES PLEASE WOULD GREATLY BENEFIT SHARING DURING EMERGENCY OPERATIONS IS ANY THING SIR PROVIDER PARTICIPATION IN THE STATE OPERATIONS CENTER DURING EMERGENCY. WHEN THE STUDENTS OPERATE CENTER ACTIVATION SUPPORT UPPER TO SEE INCLUDING PS PS HELLO YES NEEDS TO HAVE SERVICE PROVIDER REPRESENTATIVES IN THE SOCK THAT CAN UNDERSTAND THE SITUATION AND DIRECTLY AND IMMEDIATELY PROVIDE THE INFORMATION THE CAL WE **** ASK FOR PROVIDER SHOULD ALSO ESTABLISH A POINT OF CONTACT. EITHER REGIONAL. AT THE OPERATIONAL AREA LEVEL THAT CAN BE USED BY EITHER HE'S HE'S OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WHEN THEY HAVE QUESTIONS CONCERNING SERVICE OUTAGES. THESE LAYERS ONS WILL BE IN A AN IMPROVEMENT AND ALLOW FOR REAL TIME DATA SHARING CRITICAL TO SUPPORTING EMERGENCIES ACROSS THE STATE. RESPONSE EFFORTS. THE OTHER AREA INFRASTRUCTURE HARDENING. EVERYTHING WE HAVE JUST BEEN DISCUSSING IS REALLY AN OFF SHOOT OF THE REAL PROBLEM DOWN TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES IN A PERFECT WORLD. HE CAN WE CAN IF WE CAN MITIGATE OUTAGES THEMSELVES THE OUTAGE REPORTING ISSUES BECOME LESS SIGNIFICANT HOWEVER NOW CALIFORNIA HAS AN URGENT NEED TO ENSURE THAT THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS WE DEPEND ON OUR BILL TO A RESILIENT RELIABLE EVERY DONE IN STANDARD. TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE SERVICE PROVIDERS CAN DO THIS BY DEVELOPING AND IMPLEMENTING A STRATEGIC PLAN WORKING. IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE STATE THAT EXECUTES A ROBUST INITIATIVE TO IDENTIFY VULNERABILITIES HARDEN INFRASTRUCTURE AND BUILD MORE RESILIENT AND WE'VE DONE IT SYSTEM. AS WELL SERVICE PROVIDERS SHOULD NOT RELY ON A PLAN THAT SIMPLY OUTLINES PROCURING OUT OF STATE GENERATORS ON THE FLY TO BE BROUGHT IN DURING AN EMERGENCY. BUT RATHER BY BUILDING IT BACK UP POWER AT THAT IS CAPABLE OF SUSTAINING THEIR SYSTEMS FOR THREE TO SEVEN DAYS ENSURING FOR ATTIC DEFENSIBLE SPACE HARDEN BACKHAUL INFRASTRUCTURE. SUCH AS FIBER BROADCAST BROADBAND AND MICROWAVE AND TAKING OTHER STEPS TO PROTECT CELL SITES. IN HINDSIGHT I BELIEVE THAT THESE COMPANIES NOW UNDERSTAND THE REALITY OF THE CASCADING CONSEQUENCES OF MULTIPLE LARGE SCALE PS PS ADVANCE AND THAT AN EFFORT TO PROVIDE FOR TEMPORARY MOBILE RESOURCES IS NOT ONLY CHALLENGE IS SIMPLY INADEQUATE. COMMUNICATIONS SITES MUST HAVE PROPERLY SIZED PLACE GENERATORS AND A REFUELING PLAN OR AN ALTERNATE POWER SOURCE SUCH AS SOLAR POWER WITH ADEQUATE BATTERY BACKUP. DURING THE TWO THOUSAND TEN NINETEEN P. S. P. S. EVENTS IN OCTOBER OUTAGES OUTLASTED MANY OF THE CELL TOWERS EXISTING BACKUP CAPACITY. AS WELL A LACK OF SUSTAINABLE BACK CALL CONNECTIVITY IS ANOTHER GAP. BACK CALL IS THE CONNECTION FROM THE CELL SITE TO THE CELLULAR NETWORK AND IS REQUIRED FOR CELL SITES TO FUNCTION MOST CELL SITES RELY ON FIBER CONNECTIONS WHICH HAVE SWITCHED WE HAVE SEEN DAMAGED OR DESTROYED DURING A FIRE OR AN EARTHQUAKE. BACKUP CONDUCTIVITY WOULD TYPICALLY BE PROVIDED VIA MICROWAVE CONNECTIONS BUT MOST CELL SITES DO NOT HAVE BACKUP MICROWAVE FOR BACK CALL IN A RECENT INCIDENT. A LACK OF REDUNDANCY IN BACK CALL CREATED SEVERE PROBLEM FOR THE SACRAMENTO INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT. ON THE EVENING OF DECEMBER TWENTY FIRST A DRIVER STRUCK A TELEPHONE POLE THE SEVERED OF FIBER CABLE MILES FROM THE AIRPORT. OUTAGE HOWEVER LASTED FOR TWENTY THREE HOURS BECAUSE MANY FLIGHTS DELAYS AND LEAD TO TWENTY CANCEL CANCELLATION CANCELLED FLIGHTS. ON ONE OF THE BUSIEST TRAVEL DAYS OF THE YEAR MAYBE ONE OF YOU MAY HAVE GOTTEN CAUGHT UP IN THAT. OKAY HAVE THE AIRPORT MANAGEMENT UNDERSTOOD THE LACK OF BOTH RESILIENCY AND REDUNDANCY THEY MAY HAVE UTILIZE MULTIPLE OTHER SERVICE PROVIDERS TO AVOID SUCH AN OUTAGE AS WELL. AND UNDERSTANDING BY THE TELECOMMUNICATION PROVIDERS THAT AN UNPROTECTED SINGLE FIBER LINE TO CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE HAS EXTREME VULNERABILITY IS UNACCEPTABLE AND SPEAK TO MY FINAL POINT AND THAT IS A LACK OF SITE PROTECTION. LIKE THE EXAMPLES I JUST PROVIDED SEVERAL COMMERCIAL SITES SEVERAL COMMERCIAL CELL SITES AND CRITICAL FIBER LINES THAT BURNED IN THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN FIRES WERE LOCATED. ON THE SAME MOUNTAIN TOP AS THE STATE'S PUBLIC SAFETY COMMUNICATIONS SITES. INTERESTINGLY NONE OF THE STATE'S PUBLIC SAFETY COMMUNICATIONS SITES BURN BUT MANY AS MANY AS SIX OF THE COMMERCIAL CELL SITES WERE TO STORY. WE SUSPECT THAT THE GAPS AND DEFENSIBLE SPACE AND OTHER PREVENTABLE FACTORS CONTRIBUTED TO THE VULNERABILITIES OF THESE COMMERCIAL SITES LEADING TO THE DESTRUCTION OF CRITICAL COMMUNICATION SERVICES. AGAIN TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE COOPERATIVELY WE CAN WORK TO ACHIEVE WHAT IS NECESSARY. A PUBLIC SAFETY GRAY COMMITTEE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS SYSTEM THAT WILL ENSURE FOR REDUNDANT AD RESILIENT AND MOST IMPORTANTLY A RELIABLE WIRELESS AND DATA COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM THAT WE CAN THAT CAN WITHSTAND THE RISKS WE FACE IN CALIFORNIA I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH OUR PARTNERS THE TELECOMMUNICATION INDUSTRY. MY WHOLE AGENCIES BEEN DIRECTED TO WRAP AROUND AND FIND THE SOLUTIONS THAT ARE NECESSARY TO GET THIS DONE- AND THROUGH A SERIES OF METRICS AND TIME FRAMES AND DELIVERABLES I BELIEVE THAT WE CAN GET THERE WITH NOT ONLY OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH YOUR HELP AS WELL I THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE OP TO SPEAK ON THESE EVENTS BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY OF YOUR QUESTIONS. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN AND SENATORS THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR INVITING ME TO SPEAK TODAY ABOUT TOLD TELECOMMUNICATION OUTAGES I AM CHRIS RILEY ON THE EMERGENCY SERVICES MANAGER. WITH THE MARIN COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE- FIRST I JUST WANT TO COVER SOME BACKGROUND OF OUR EXPERIENCES AND I APOLOGIZE SO THIS IS BEING COVERED BY THE DIRECTOR AND OTHERS. BUT I JUST WANT TO GIVE YOU A FLAVOR OF WHAT OUR EXPERIENCES WERE IN IN MARIN COUNTY AS YOU'RE LIKELY AWARE- LATE LAST YEAR MARIN COUNTY EXPERIENCE TO PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUTDOWNS. THOSE SHUTDOWNS CAUSE TELECOMMUNICATION OUTAGES IN A SERIES OF CASCADING EVENTS. THE FIRST P. AS PS WAS FROM OCTOBER EIGHT TO TWELVE. AND THE SECOND MORE SERIOUS EVENT FOR US- WAS FROM OCTOBER TWENTY SIXTH TO NOVEMBER FIRST. WHEN KENNEDY WAS A LIKELY THE MOST NEGATIVELY IMPACTED COUNTY IN THE SECOND ADVENT. VIRTUALLY A WITHOUT POWER- THE PS PS TURNED OFF POWER TO VIRTUALLY THE ENTIRE COUNTY AS I STATED- INITIALLY WE WERE NOTIFIED BY P. JEANNIE THAT SOMEWHERE BETWEEN. ONE HUNDRED AND THOUSAND CUSTOMERS. IT WOULD HAVE THEIR POWER SHUT DOWN FOR ALMOST ONE WEEK- THAT NUMBERS KIND OF MISLEADING BECAUSE IF-YOU THINK ABOUT IT THAT'S REALLY TIMES THREE. WHICH IF YOU DO THE MATH IS REALLY MORE THAN OUR POPULATION SO. IT HAD QUITE AN EFFECT ON US. QUITE SEVERE. PRIOR TO THE SECOND TIAS PAY US IS THE DIRECTOR'S STATED AND OTHERS HAVE STATED. KINCAID FIRE STARTED IN CINEMA COUNTY DIRECTLY TO THE NORTH OF MARIN. THE FIRE BURNED FROM OCTOBER TWENTY THIRD TO NOVEMBER SIXTH. IN A FIRE IN THE P. S. P. S. MARIN COUNTY PROVIDED MUTUALLY TO CINEMA IN VARIOUS FORMS INCLUDING PROVIDING MASCARA SHELTER- TO ALMOST FIVE HUNDRED PEOPLE IN OUR MARIN CENTER AT THE FAIRGROUNDS. THOSE PEOPLE AND PETS QUITE OPERATION OUR COUNTY EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTER WAS ACTIVATED DURING THE DURATION OF THE FIRE AND THE P. S. P. S. AND IN OUR FUNCTION IS TO SUPPORT FIELD OPERATIONS AND COORDINATE RESOURCES WHICH WE WERE DOING FOR VIRTUALLY TO DISASTERS. AND I WILL TELL YOU THAT THE LACK OF POWER IN THE LACK OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS MADE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO MANAGE THE SHELTER OPERATION THAN THAN WE'VE EVER SEEN EVEN MORE SO THAN. TWENTY SEVENTEEN WHEN WE DID THAT. THE SAME THING. WITHIN A DAY OF THE PSP AS WE STARTED LOSING TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE THROUGHOUT MARIN. THIS SERVICE DISRUPTION WAS ACROSS THE SPECTRUM. AS WE TALKED ABOUT ALREADY TODAY WIRELESS VOICE AND DATA WAS EITHER SLOW OR NONEXISTENT. CABLE TV VOICE OVER INTERNET PROTOCOL IN INTERNET WAS OUT. WIRED AND FIRED FIBER LINE PHONES AND DATA WAS ALSO OUT OF VERY SLOW. WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN TOLD THE TRADITIONAL COPPER LINE TELEPHONE WOULD NEVER GO DOWN AND MERGING SEE YET THAT WAS NOT OUR EXPERIENCE AND I WAS NOT THE EXPERIENCE OF OUR RESIDENTS. MY OWN HOME WAS IT HAS A- COPPER LINE. PHONE AND IT WAS OUT FOR A WEEK SO THAT WAS NOT GOOD- THE EDGES CONTINUED FOR SEVERAL DAYS UNTIL THE PSP HAS POWER RESTORATION BEGAN. WE DID HAVE SOME CONTACTS WITH THE INDUSTRY SERVICE PROVIDERS- WE MADE CONTACT WITH SOME OF THEM BUT BASIC OF IT THE RESPONSE THAT WE GOT WAS- YOU'RE GONNA GET YOUR SERVICE BACK ON WHEN THE POWER COMES BACK ON BECAUSE WE'RE POWER DEPENDENT TO. SO WHAT WERE THE IMPACTS TO PUBLIC pSAFETY AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE I'D LIKE TO SHARE SOME OF OUR DIRECT EXPERIENCES IN THE COUNTY. AS I SAID OUR ROLE THAT COUNTY OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES DURING THE RESPONSE PHASE OF ANY DISASTER IS TO SUPPORT FIELD OPERATIONS COORDINATOR RESOURCES FROM OUR- EOC AND ELSEWHERE CAN SHARE INFORMATION. TWO OF OUR KEY FUNCTIONS ARE ALERT AND WARNING. AND PUBLIC INFORMATION DISSEMINATION. WE USE MANY DIFFERENT SYSTEMS AND PASSED TO WARN AND SHARE INFORMATION WITH THE PUBLIC. NOW IT IS A MAJORITY OF THESE SYSTEMS RELY ON TELECOMMUNICATIONS. WHEN THEY'RE NOT WORKING WE CANNOT WARN THE PUBLIC OF IMPENDING DANGER. LIKEWISE THE PUBLIC MAY NOT BE ABLE TO CALL OR TEXT FOR HELP. WHEN TELECOMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS ARE DOWN WE ALSO CANNOT COMMUNICATE EFFECTIVELY WITH ALL THE PUBLIC SET TO RESPOND HERS SO THAT'S WITHIN OUR INDUSTRY SO TO SPEAK. AND THOSE ASSISTING RESPOND HERS. WE ALSO RELIANT TELECOMMUNICATIONS FOR SITUATIONAL AWARENESS RESOURCE MANAGEMENT. AND A COMMON OPERATING PICTURE. BY THE SYSTEM THAT WE USE IN CONJUNCTION WITH CALLAWAY US- AND EVEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS A SYSTEM CALLED LIBYA SEE KALLIO SEE FOR THE STATE- YOU KNOW THAT SYSTEM. IS INTERCONNECTED WITH THE STATE AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT- AND FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGERS THROUGH THE INTERNET. SO THESE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED BY TELL COMMUNITY TELECOMMUNICATION COMPANIES. I AND WE NEED THIS IS SERVICE TO BE RELIANT AND REDUNDANT. YOU KNOW I REALLY HAVE KIND OF A TOP THREE- IMPACTS MAJOR IMPACTS OF THESE OF THESE OUTAGES AND I MAY HAVE MENTIONED SOME OF THEM A NUMBER ONE REALLY IS PUBLIC SAFETY COMMUNICATIONS. YOU KNOW WE HAVE RADIOS IN THOSE ARE pALL THE OTHER TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES FOR COMMUNICATING WITH PUBLIC SAFETY AND THROUGHOUT FROM EOC AND IN THE FIELD. THE LACK OF WIRED AND CELLULAR BASE VOICE SMS AND DATA COMMUNICATIONS AND SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED PUBLIC SAFETY IS ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE. AND PROVIDE CRITICAL SERVICES. NOWADAYS MANY IMPOSED A MANY POLICE AND FIRE AGENCIES USE MOBILE DATA TERMINALS. THERE OFTEN THEY'RE ALSO KNOWN AS ENTITIES. AND THESE RUN ON CELLULAR DATA- ALSO MORE AND MORE AGENCIES ARE USING SMART PHONE BASED APPS FOR THINGS LIKE DATABASE CHECKS FOR. CRIMINALS ARE SUSPECTS LOS PERSONS AND MEDICAL REPORTING TO RECEIVING HOSPITALS. THE SECOND AND PROBABLY THE MORE IMPORTANT- OF FACTS NEGATIVE EFFECT OF THE LACK OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES IS THE LACK OF OUR ABILITY TO WARN IN INFORM THOSE WITHIN OUR COUNTY. WITH NO OR DEGRADED TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES WERE NOT ABLE TO WARN OR INFORM THE PUBLIC VIA PHONE CALL TEXT EMAIL OR WEBSITE. MANY OF OUR SYSTEM SUCH AS WHAT WE CALL MORAN WHICH IS A REVERSE NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM- OR IN ANOTHER SYSTEM THAT WE USE WHICH IS AN EXCELLENT SURE MOST OF YOU ARE AWARE THAT THEY RELY ON VOICE SMS EMAIL. APPLE OR OR A LINK TO A WEBSITE TO PROVIDE FURTHER INFORMATION. DURING THE RECENT PS PS IS THAT OF AND TELECOMMUNICATION FAILURES IT AT THE END OF LAST YEAR. THE MOST COMMON CONCERN AND FEEDBACK THAT WE GOT FROM PEOPLE IN MARIN COUNTY WAS. AND THEY WERE PUBLIC YEAH CONSUMERS OF OUR NEXT TO MESSAGES ON OUR OTHER FRIEND MESSAGES WAS. YOU'RE SENDING US INFORMATION SOMETIMES THE TEXAS GETTING THROUGH BUT WE OFTEN INCLUDE A LINK TO A WEBSITE AND OF COURSE WITH THE INTERNET DOWN THEY WERE UNABLE TO GET THAT FOR THEIR INFORMATION. THAT WAS THE NUMBER ONE. FEEDBACK THAT WE GOT- SO WE MADE SOME CHANGES BASED ON THAT BUT BUT THEN AGAIN WE NEED THAT TOOL TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE FULL INFORMATION BASICALLY THEY WERE UNABLE TO OPEN THOSE LINKS ON THERE. THERE'S SOLD THEIR MOBILE DEVICES BECAUSE THE CELL TOWERS ARE DOWN. AND THEN THE THIRD. MOST IMPORTANT- FACTS- AND IT'S RELATED TO YOU KNOW MESSAGING THE PUBLIC OF COURSE IS THE INABILITY TO SEND- WE AS A WIRELESS EMERGENCY ALERTS AND I'M HIGHLIGHTING NOW WHEN BECAUSE THAT'S ONE OF OUR GREATEST TOOLS- THERE'S A REAL DIFFERENCE IN THE TOOLS THAT WE USE FOR ALERTING THE PUBLIC- THERE'S THE OLD. DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OPT IN OPT OUT SO WE IT IS NOT AN OPT IN SYSTEM SO WE CAN REACH THE MOST PEOPLE YOU KNOW AS LONG AS THEY COME INTO THAT GEOGRAPHIC AREA THAT WE TARGETED AND THEY HAVE THEIR MOBILE DEVICE ON. WE'RE GOING TO GET A MESSAGE TO THEM. AS LONG AS THOSE CELL PHONE TOWERS A RAP THIS SYSTEM REQUIRES THE MOBILE WIRELESS TOWERS ARE UP AND RUNNING. THIS IS IMPORTANT NOW MORE THAN EVER GIVEN THE FACT THAT MOST MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC HAVE GIVEN UP THEIR WIRE LINE PHONES. IN FAVOR OF WIRELESS. AS I SAID BEFORE THIS IS REALLY ONE OF OUR BEST A WARNING OPTIONS GIVEN ITS NON OPT IN NATURE. SO IF YOU WELL I'D LIKE TO MENTION A FEW THINGS WHEN SOMETHING'S A WE'D LIKE TO SEE GOING FORWARD SOME SOME TOOLS SOME CHANGES SOME MAY BE IN A BETTER RELATIONSHIP. WHATEVER THAT WE NEED TO DO- TO DO A BETTER JOB. HELLO YES CAN DO A BETTER JOB IT'S BEEN STATED BEFORE EMERGENCY MANAGERS NEED TO CONSISTENT. AVAILABLE KNOWLEDGEABLE CONTACT TO G. WITH EACH OF THE TELECOMMUNICATION PROVIDERS. THAT WAY WE GET THE UP TO DATE AND ACCURATE INFORMATION. NUMBER TWO EMERGENCY MANAGERS NEED TO KNOW WHERE CELL PHONE TOWERS ARE LOCATED. I KNOW THAT'S A STRUGGLE I KNOW IT'S PROPRIETARY INFORMATION WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS TO BE ABLE TO ENSURE THAT OUR MESSAGES THAT WERE SENDING OUT ARE DISTRIBUTED. TO AN AREA THAT NEEDS POTENTIALLY LIFESAVING NOTIFICATIONS WE SEND OUT NOTIFICATIONS ABOUT EVACUATIONS IN SHELTERS IN PLACE. IN THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN FAR AS WE WERE ONE OF THE FEW COUNTIES IS SEND OUT A WE- TO THE PEOPLE THAT WERE SCAPIN CINNAMON COMING DOWN INTO MARIN. FOR KAREN SHELTER. WELL WE KNOW FROM EXPERIENCE AND STORIES- THAT IS CURRENTLY POSSIBLE TO SEND A WE ARE WITHOUT ACTUALLY GOING TO THE PUBLIC. BY INADVERTENTLY GEO LOCATING A TARGET AREA FOR A MESSAGE. THAT DOES NOT CONTAIN ANY TOWERS WITHIN THAT GEO LOCATED AREA. IT'S ACTUALLY OCCURRED IN THE STATE. SO IF WE HAVE THAT INFORMATION WE COULD ACT ACCORDINGLY. IN TERMS OF KNOWING WHICH TOOL TO USE TO THE WAR TO WARN THE PUBLIC. THIRDLY EMERGENCY MANAGERS NEED TO KNOW THE STATUS OF STE CELLULAR SMS- WIRELESS EMERGENCY ALERTS AND DATA FUNCTIONALITY OF EACH PROVIDER SYSTEM BY TARYN AREA. IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND WHAT PUBLIC ALERTING OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE DURING EMERGENCY WE WILL SHIFT OUR ACTIONS BASED ON WHAT WE KNOW. IS CAPABLE OF GETTING THE MESSAGE OUT. I NUMBER FOR EMERGENCY MANAGERS NEED BILL AN ADDRESS AND PHONE NUMBER OF CELLULAR CUSTOMERS FOR INCLUSION IN REVERSE NINE ONE ONE SYSTEMS. CURRENTLY WE CAN GET THAT DATA FOR PLAIN OLD TELEPHONE LINES WHICH WE GET FROM COMPANIES LIKE COMCAST- FRONTIER- FOR YOU KNOW THOSE THOSE WIRED PHONES WE POPULATE THAT IN OUR SYSTEM- AND THAT WAY WE CAN CALL THOSE NUMBERS IN EVENT OF EMERGENCY WE CURRENTLY CAN I GET THAT FOR. FOR CELL PHONE SO THEY HAVE TO OPT INTO OUR SYSTEM AND QUITE HONESTLY THAT'S THE STRUGGLE OF MOST OF THE COUNTIES IN THE STATE VERY AVERAGE SOMEWHERE AROUND TEN TO TWENTY PERCENT- YOU KNOW OPT IN WHICH IS PRETTY LOW- WE CAN DO WE CONSTANTLY MARKET OUR SYSTEM BUT WE'RE RELYING ON PEOPLE DOING THAT ON AROUND. FIFTH WE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW THE EXPECTED UP TIME AND FUNCTIONALITY OF CELLULAR SITES FOR PLANNING PURPOSES. AND THEN NEED AS CLOSE TO REAL TIME AS POSSIBLE INFORMATION AN ACTUAL UPTIME AND FUNCTIONALITY DURING EMERGENCY. I BELIEVE THAT'S BEEN STATED BEFORE. IN ADDITION TO WIRELESS AND CELLULAR WE'D LIKE TO KNOW THE EXPECTED UP TIME OF WIRELINE PHONE INFRASTRUCTURE AN ACTUAL UP TIME AND FUNCTIONALITY DURING EMERGENCY. AS WE DISCOVERED IN OCTOBER TWENTY NINETEEN MUCH OF THE WIRELESS SYSTEM NOW DEPENDS ON CONTINUOUS POWER OUTSIDE OF THE RESIDENCE. DURING THE OCTOBER TWENTY NINETEEN NOW JUST OUTAGES IT BECAME CLEAR THAT DATA COMMUNICATION TO SELL SITES IS ALSO A WEAK LINK THIS IS ALREADY BEEN DISCUSSED. WE NEED TO KNOW THE EXACT EXPECTED IMPACT OF POWER FAILURES AND ALSO NON POWER RELATED COMMUNICATION FAILURES ON THE WIRELESS AND CELLULAR INFRASTRUCTURE. FINALLY SO YOU'RE SITES NEED TO HAVE MUCH MUCH BETTER RESILIENCE TO POWER FAILURES THIS IS ALREADY BEEN DISCUSSED- THIS IS THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT THE PUBLIC DEPENDS ON FOR POTENTIALLY LIFE SAVING. NINE ONE ONE COMMUNICATIONS WITH PUBLIC SAFETY FOR MEDICAL FIRE AND LAW ENFORCEMENT NEEDS. THANK YOU NOW WE'RE GONNA GO TO CENTER MORE LET. THANK YOU MEDICARE. MR KILLER DUDE SHE HAVE THE CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE WOULD LIKE TO GIVE YOU A PROCLAMATION FOR HAVING PRESENTED AT THE MOST HEARINGS IN THE LAST THREE YEARS YOU. IT'S A DIRECT CORRELATION TO THE NUMBER OF DISASTERS WE. BUT I THINK MISS BADGERS A CATCHING UP TO YEAH SO SHOULD BE AN INTERESTING RACE- I WANT TO GET BACK TO A MISTRIAL YOU IF YOU HAD A- USE THE TERM EMERGENCY MANAGERS. AND I'M CONCERNED ABOUT PUBLIC SAFETY COMMUNICATION AS WELL PEOPLE AREN'T. ABLE TO CONTACT. HE'S DEPARTMENTS AND FIRE DEPARTMENTS FIRE DEPARTMENTS AND POLICE DEPARTMENTS AB HAVING TROUBLE AS WELL JUST COMMUNICATINGOF THEMSELVES WITH EACH OTHER IN ORANGE COUNTY WE HAVE AN EIGHT HUNDRED MEGAHERTZ SYSTEM. BUT A BIG TOWER ON CATALINA ISLAND SO THAT WE COULD TRY AND MAKE SURE WE COULD COMMUNICATE I'M JUST CURIOUS. HOW HOW WAS THE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN YOUR PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICIALS DURING THESE- DISASTERS. IT WAS GOOD I MEAN WEEK WE CAN RELY ON OUR- MORE IN EMERGENCY RADIO AS A SYSTEM AND WE'RE ACTUALLY IN THE MIDDLE OF A- NEXT GENERATION BUILD OUT OF THAT SYSTEM SO IN TERMS OF. THE ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE OVER RADIOS IT WAS FINE I MEAN THAT'S A REALLY GOOD SYSTEM AND WORKED WELL- I WAS IN THE A. C. FOR. ALMOST A WEEK DURING THE POWER SHUTDOWNS AND YOU KNOW WE IT WAS A LOT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT THE LHASA TELECOMMUNICATIONS. BECAUSE QUITE HONESTLY A LOT OF THE- MANNER IN LAW AND FIRE THEY USE THEIR CELL PHONE TWO TO COMMUNICATE A LOT TO TAX TO TALK TO EACH OTHER. AND THEY WERE VERY FRUSTRATED BY THOSE OUTAGES SO THERE IS THAT THAT WAS IN EFFECT. MR KILLER DO G. STAY CALM IS THAT YOUR- COMMUNICATION SYSTEM FOR THAT FOR YES. STATE CONDE COM S. TACOM. I HAVE A NO I DON'T EITHER THAT BACK OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES STATE ME MUNICH CATIONS SYSTEM WELL WE HAVE THE STATE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM WHICH IS THE ENTIRE A BACKBONE OF ALL OF THE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMUNICATIONS IN THE STATE THAT THE NOT ONLY HANDLES ALL STATE AGENCIES BUT IS THE BACKBONE FOR SUPPORTING LOCAL GOVERNMENT ARE NINE ONE ONE CENTERS- EXCEPT YOURSELF IF THAT IS WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT IS OUR- PROGRAM. IT'S NOT IT'S A HIGH FREQUENCY RADIO I'VE HIGH FREQUENCY WAY IT'S BOTH MICROWAVE AND- AND IT IS A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT CAPABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH THAT THAT THAT THAT WORK. IN OUR I'M UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT. OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES ARE TRYING TO UPGRADE AND WORK ON THEIR HIGH FREQUENCY IN AND I HAVE A LETTER FROM THE SHERIFF OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY- CONCERNED ABOUT. SAY SHIP COM. OR URGENT LINK. I'M JUST WONDERING. HOW HOW ARE THAT THE PROCESS SEES FOR MAYBE IMPLEMENTING THIS TECHNOLOGY HOW'S IT COMING ALONG. SO WE GET A LOT OF DIFFERENT. UNDER STATE COME DOES WITH NEW AND INNOVATIVE CAPABILITIES WE DO PUT THEM THROUGH A PROCESS OF EVALUATION- VIRGIN LIKE IS ONE OF SEVERAL- THAT- BILLS IN A REDUNDANCY LAYS OVER THE TOP OF. THE SYSTEMS THAT WE HAVE BY THE WAY WE HAVE I SOMETHING LIKE SIX DIFFERENT REDUNDANT COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN HAVE. PUBLIC SAFETY COMMUNICATIONS POINT THE POINT TO OUR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO OUR STATE AGENCIES THAT'S DIFFERENT BY THE WAY THEN PUBLIC COMMUNICATIONS THAT IS PROVIDED BY THE PRIVATE SECTOR CELLULAR PROVIDERS. BUT FROM THE STANDPOINT OF STATE COMMUNICATIONS AND PUBLIC SAFETY WE DO LOOK AT ALL THOSE- URGENT LIKE A TO MY KNOWLEDGE IS ONE THAT WE HAVE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF EVALUATING- BUT IT IS AGAIN A SYSTEM THAT WILL BE IS OVER. AND IS THEREFORE A REDUNDANCY THANK YOU CENTER JACKSON. YES THANK YOU ALWAYS A PLEASURE TO SEE YOU DIRECTOR GIL INTO CHIU SPECIALLY WHEN THERE'S NOT A FIRE. GOING ON BUT IT IS ALWAYS A GOOD FEELING TO HAVE YOU THERE WHEN WE HAVE FIRES BECAUSE I. I THINK WE ALL I'M LOOKING AROUND THE ROOM MANY OF US HAVE HAD THAT EXPERIENCE AND WHEN YOU'RE IN THE ROOM- THIS IS IT ELEVATES SENT SENSE OF CONFIDENCE AND SO I APPRECIATE VERY MUCH THE- THE WORK YOU'VE DONE. AND THE FACT THAT YOU'VE CONTINUED TO DO IT- EVEN THOUGH YOU'VE BEEN THREATENING TO- TO START TAKING SOME NICE LONG WALKS ON THE BEACH FOR QUITE SOME TIME REALLY DO APPRECIATE YOUR CONTINUED. EFFORTS ON BEHALF OF THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA- I WANT TO ASK YOU THE- QUESTION TO WHAT I ASKED THE CPUC- YOU AND I'VE TALKED FOR QUITE SOME TIME MY PARTICULAR INTEREST IS A CENTER. ARE DONE ON OUR MERCHANT SEALER TO STORMS- THE FACT THAT WE ARE IS THERE ARE THOSE. THOSE ARE LOOKS AT PHONES THAT ARE WITHIN THE- AWARE THERE IS THAT NEED TO BE WARNED ABOUT POTENTIAL. DISASTER AND THE FACT THAT IT IS BEEN VERY DIFFICULT TO GET OUR WIRELESS COMPANIES TO- TAKE SOME LEVEL OF RESPONSIBILITY OR OWNERSHIP OF THEIR- REQUIREMENTS AS AS PARTNERS IN THIS EFFORT. I AM PLEASED TO HEAR THAT THAT SEEMS TO BE INVOLVING- AYE AYE IT GIVES ME SOME CONFIDENCE IN SOME OF THE LEGISLATION THAT I AM DOING TO TRY TO ENSURE THAT THAT HAPPENS. BUT I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR FROM YOU- WHAT AUTHORITY YOU BELIEVE YOU NEED. TO CONTINUE A BOWL TO COLLECT THE INFORMATION FROM THE TELECOMMUNICATION COMPANIES. I AND- THIS REQUIRE THEIR PARTICIPATION IN SOME OF THESE COLLECTED SOLUTIONS. AS WELL AS IN THESE EMERGENCY ALERT SITUATIONS- WHAT. WHAT WE IS A LEGISLATURE CAN DO TO ASSIST YOU. AND NOT JUST. ASKING THE COMPANIES TO PARTICIPATE BUT TO FOR THEM TO REALIZE THAT THEY HAVE AN OBLIGATION. UNDER LAW TO PARTICIPATE AND TO HELP PROTECT PUBLIC SAFETY- AND ALSO TO KEEP OUR STATE GOING. DURING THESE PSP SNC ENTERING OUR- FIRES WHEN THE SYSTEMS ARE DOWN WHAT DO YOU NEED. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION AND COURSE THE SUPPORT BASE- IS PHENOMENAL FROM THE LEGISLATURE- I THINK YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT THERE'S A LOT PROBABLY THE ANSWER THAT QUESTION SENATOR- YOU KNOW CERTAINLY THE WORK THAT HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED. WITH WITH FOR EXAMPLE ON ALERT AND WARNING YOU KNOW YOUR BILL ABOUT DOING- BE ABLE TO JUST- BOB DAN VERSUS YOU KNOW OPTING OUT THAT THAT THAT WHOLE PIECE. ACTUALLY TAKING THAT AND MOVING THAT BOW DOWN TO THE- CITY LEVEL WILL BE A HUGE- ASSISTANCE SO THAT WE HAVE ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT- THAT HAVE THE ABILITY TO PARTICIPATE IN THAT PROGRAM. THAT WILL ALSO ENHANCE THEM THE COMMUNICATIONS WITH WITH OUR CITIZENS- THE- WORK THAT HAS BEEN DONE THE SENATE REQUIRES BILLION IN BEGINNING THAT PROCESS OF GETTING AYE DATA REPORTING GET OUT OF REPORTED. THAT'S GOOD THE REPORT I THINK IT'S EVOLVING- AND- I'M I'M HOPING THAT THAT MUCH OF THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING- WITH OUR TELECOMMUNICATION PARTNERS NOW IS TRULY. GOING TO BE MAINTAINED A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT- WE ALL HAVE TO BE ROWING IN THE SAME DIRECTION AND THROUGH THAT- INITIATIVE- THERE THERE MAY BE THINGS FOR EXAMPLE IF WE'RE REALLY GOING TO PUT THE- THAT THE EFFORT FORWARD TO RAPIDLY ASSASSIN AND BUILD OUT THE NEEDS OF UPGRADING OUR SYSTEM TO MAKE IT RESILIENT. THERE MAY BE SOME LEGISLATIVE ACTIONS THAT NEED TO TAKE PLACE THAT STREAMLINED THAT EFFORT THAT CAN HELP THE TELCOS BE ABLE TO- AFFECTIVELY PUT THEIR CAPABILITIES IN PLACE AND- MUCH LIKE WE'VE DONE IN OTHER CRISIS SITUATIONS THERE THERE'S OPPORTUNITIES THERE TO BE ABLE TO STREAMLINE THAT PROCESS AND I THINK THAT WOULD BE A GREAT PLACE WHERE WE COULD WORK WITH YOU AND BASED UPON THE MEETINGS WERE HAVING WITH THE TELCOS FIND A WAY TO DO THAT. IT IT IT SHOULD I THINK. L. T. TO I MEAN WE ARE PRETTY GOOD AT FORTY IS NOW BUT- I THINK BUILDING ON THE EGGS ON THE INITIAL UP. THE BILL THAT THAT SET FORTH REPORTING I THINK WE PROBABLY NEED TO CONTINUE TO SEE HOW THAT GOES AND PROBABLY MAYBE STEPPED THAT UP A LITTLE BIT AS TIME GOES ON BECAUSE- YOU KNOW THERE THE REPORTING OF THAT IS THE REPORTING OF THOSE OUTAGES. ARE EXTREMELY CRITICAL AND UP IT WAS A SOURCE OF FRUSTRATION. I DO BELIEVE AT THIS POINT AFTER THIS LAST PS PS A BAD- THAT WE ARE ON MORE OF THE SAME PACE THAN WE'VE EVER BEEN BEFORE. BUT AS WE SAY THE PROOF'S IN THE PUDDING AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO SEE HOW THINGS PROGRESS THANK YOU SENATOR WILL MOVE ON TO CENTER MCGUIRE. THANK YOU SO MUCH AS CHAIR. THE VERY QUICK- MISTER DIRECTOR THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK SIR- IN ECHO THE SENTIMENTS OF A CENTER JACKSON THAT THIS IS A LIFETIME JOB UP INTO YOUR NINETIES SO WE LOOK FOR TO ANSWER. I'M NOT A REPEAT WITH MISTER HILL DESCENT SO. LOOK I DON'T WANT TO JUST- THROW STONES TODAY BECAUSE I THINK THAT WE'RE ALL INTERESTED IN IN LOOKING FOR SOLUTIONS AND WILL SAY- OVER THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS TELECOMMUNICATION COMPANIES IN ME WITH OUR OFFICE I KNOW THAT THE MEETING WITH YOU AND MEAN WITH MANY OF US ABOUT SOLUTIONS ESPECIALLY ON BACKUP POWER BUT I WANT TO ADDRESS SIX I THINK IT'S ONE OF OUR BIGGEST ONE ABILITIES WHEN IT COMES TO. OUR STATE WHY TELECOMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM. MY UNDERSTANDING IS- EARLIER THIS PAST SUMMER OUR UNDERSTANDING WAS THAT TELECOMMUNICATION COMPANIES PREPARED FOR THE WORST. AND THEN WE GET THROUGH THIS SIGNIFICANT POWER OUTAGE OF IN A SERIES OF EVENTS THAT WE SAW THROUGHOUT- THE CALIFORNIA AND IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. IT'S CLEAR THEY WERE NOT. IN IN FACT MY UNDERSTANDING IS. SCRAMBLING TO BRING IN RESOURCES FROM OUT OF STATE TO TRY TO KEEP THEIR GRADE. IN THEIR TELECOMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM UP AND RUNNING. I'D LIKE TO GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING WHAT YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS- AND THEN I'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO HEAR YOUR SUGGESTIONS- IN REGARD TO REDUNDANT BACKUP POWER. SO THANK YOU. THE FACTS ARE THAT I THINK THAT THE THAT THE EVENTS OF THE P. S. P. WHERE. YOU KNOW UNDER UNDER THOUGHT AND- YOU KNOW THE EVENT GOT OUT IN FRONT OF THE TELECOMS- PROVIDERS- AND THEY REALIZE THAT- YOU KNOW THEIR EXISTING CAPABILITY TO KEEP THEIR TOWERS UP AND WHAT POWERS THEY HAD OR WHAT BACK CALL THEY HAVE BEEN THEY HAD SOME REGENCY POWER WAS IN THERE IN SUFFICIENT. SO THE BASE SCRAMBLED AROUND IT WAS THE RELATING NEED QUITE FRANKLY AND- AND SO- BACK THAT RESULT IN THEM HAVING TO GO. IN STATE BUT ALSO OUT OF STATE TO GET- EMERGENCY POWER BE HONEST IT WAS A LITTLE COMPLICATED BECAUSE AS THEY CAME TO THE BORDERS OF CALIFORNIA IF THEY COMING FROM TEXAS- THEY DID MEET OUR AIR QUALITY STANDARDS AND SO THEN- YES HAD TO SCRAMBLE TO GET WAIVERS- TO BE ABLE TO LET THAT MAN UNDER EMERGENCY ORDER- BECAUSE WE NEEDED HEM AT THE TIME. IT'S REALLY NOT THE WAY WE LIKE TO DO BUSINESS I THINK COLLECTIVELY IN AGAIN ALL BEING ON THE SAME PAGE. WE HAVE. WE HAVE FOUGHT THROUGH. WHAT CATASTROPHIC DISASTERS LOOK LIKE IN THE STATE WE HAVE BUILT CATASTROPHIC RESPONSE PLANS. THAT HAVE VERY DETAILED- DATA OUTLINED IN THOSE- TO TALK ABOUT LOSS OF POWER IT BACK TO COMMUNITIES EXCEPT TRUCK. THAT THAT DATA IS AVAILABLE AND WHEN CAN WE HAVE TALKED TO THE TELECOMS IN THE PAST ABOUT. THE FACT THAT GOING OUT OF STATE OR SIX. A PORTABLE CELL ON WHEELS- IS NOT A SUFFICIENT FOR THE KIND OF DISASTERS WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA. I WOULD JUST SAY THAT THIS POINT. GOING THROUGH WHAT WE'VE ALL BEEN THROUGH. I THINK EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS REALLY WHAT THE CASCADING IMPACTS AND THE DIRECT IMPACTS OF THOSE LIFE LINES ARE. SO WE NOW HAVE A NEW STANDARD TO OPERATE FROM. EVERYBODY'S BEEN THROUGH IT AND I'M HOPING THAT THROUGH THIS COLLABORATIVE. EFFORT WHAT WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD. AND TO GET WHERE WE NEED TO GET TO YES I MENTION MY- MY STATEMENT IS THAT DUMB. THEY REALLY NEED TO BUILD AND BAKE IN- AS WE DO THIS INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS- AYE AYE DRAFTING- CAPABILITY WITH HIS EMERGENCY POWER THAT IS. BEYOND FOUR HOURS AND THAT IS REALLY PART OF HARDENING THAT. CAPABILITY WRAPPING FIBER LINES SO THAT THEY DON'T CRACK BREAK BURN OR MELT- BEING ABLE TO DO DEFENSIBLE SPACE AROUND CELL SIZE HARDENING THOSE SITES- AND IF THERE'S SOME. REGULATORY OR OTHER KINDS OF ADMINISTRATIVE ISSUES WHERE THE STATE CAN HELP STREAMLINE THOSE EFFORTS. I THINK WE'D SIT DOWN AND HELP TO DO THAT AND THAT YOU KNOW ARE THIS IS RELEASED ABOUT CRISIS SITUATION BECAUSE THERE IS NO WAY. NO WAY. THAT WE SHOULD HAVE ANOTHER YEAR LIKE WE DID IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN WE- AS A SOCIETY SHOULD NOT EXPECT. THAT WE NOT ONLY LOSE. POWER TO MILLIONS BUT ARE ALL OF OUR COMMUNICATIONS ALL OF OUR DATA. WE CAN'T BE DRIVEN INTO ONE SYSTEM. AND THEN THAT SYSTEM THEN BECOME SO VULNERABLE THAT WE LOSE IT ALL BECAUSE LEISER RISK IT'S UNACCEPTABLE. SO WE CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN SO TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE AND WE NEED TO MOVE FOR WITH A DEFINITIVE PLAN WORKING TOGETHER TO GET WHAT WE NEED TO GET TO THANK YOU WE'RE GONNA GO. TO CENTER MONEY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. I ALSO WANT TO THINK MISTER KILLER DUE TO YOU AND ALL OF YOUR TEAM- ALSO WELCOME TO MISTER RILEY- SO MISTER RILEY TOUCHED ON FIRST RESPONDER ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER- USING IMPROVED RADIO SYSTEMS AND I I'VE SEEN WITH CAL FIRE AND STATE PARKS THESE NEW SYSTEMS ALLOW INTER AGENCY COMMUNICATION ETCETERA. I GUESS FOR MISTER GULAR DUE TO FIRST WAS THERE ANY EVIDENCE OF OUTAGES IMPEDING FIRST RESPONDER ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER. LET ME JUST CAST MEASURES ARE DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR PUBLIC SAFETY COMMUNICATIONS SO. BETTER AND GOOD MORNING- MITCH MEDIC OF A CHAIR. I WAS JUST LIKE SAY IF WE DID NOT HAVE ANY EXPERIENCE OF ANY- MAJOR OUTAGES OR OUR ISSUES WITH OUR NETWORK SO THAT SUPPORTS ALL THE STATE AGENCIES THAT- RIGHT OVER THE RADIO SYSTEM. AND IT'S OUR NETWORK IS BUILT WITH ALL OF THE PUBLIC SAFETY GRADE UPGRADES THAT THE DIRECTORS TALKING ABOUT SO. THAT'S THAT'S REASSURING ACTUALLY IN THAT WOULD SUGGEST. INDEPENDENT POWER SOURCES FROM. CLEARLY RADIOS ARE BATTERY DRIVEN BUT THE- RELAY CENTERS AT CENTER HAVE THEIR OWN. POWER REDUNDANCY DURING A POWER OUTAGE THAT'S CORRECT IN COURSE WE HAD TO DO REFUELING OPERATIONS TO THOSE GENERATORS% AND THAT IS A CHALLENGE DURING THE MIDDLE THE EVENT PARTICULAR IN FIRE AREAS THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN MOMENTARY LAPSES BECAUSE OF A FIRE THAT'S EXISTING BECAUSE YOU COULDN'T GET IN BUT AS SOON AS IT WAS REFILL. RESTORE LET ME SAY THOUGH THAT THE PUBLIC REACHED FIFTY RESPOND HERS WHEN WE TALK ABOUT MOVING DATA YOU KNOW THEY'RE USING CELLS CELLS SERVICES WELL THE USE OF THE SYSTEMS. TO COMMUNICATE WAS IMPEDED RIGHT THE LAND MOBILE RADIO SYSTEMS ARE MICROWAVE NETWORK OUR PUBLIC SAID COMMUNICATIONS THEM WAS OPERATIONAL FOR WHAT- FOR BUT THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR JUST MENTIONED- BUT THE IN THE USE OF THESE WERE IN IMPACTED JUST LIKE- JUST LIKE- THE PUBLIC THANK YOU IN IN THAT CAN IMPEDE THE ABILITY TO RELATE OTHER DATA OR- GROUPS DATA MAPPING YEAH. TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT MISTER RILEY LOU THIS IS WELL LAND MINES WE HAVE THE ABILITY FOR REVERSE NINE ONE ONE NOTIFICATION IN IN THE EXTREME OF ACTIVATION THIS IS. THE CONCERN Là. BUT ONLY OFTEN FOR SELF SERVICE TODAY I UNDERSTAND THAT CORRECTLY WITH A VERY LOW UPTAKE TOM WAS IN MARIN COUNTY OF PEOPLE OPTING IN FOR THAT RIVERS. NINE ONE ONE- WHY IS THERE THAT DISTINCTION AND WHAT'S THE REMEDY TO GET WITH MORE AND MORE PEOPLE MOVING TO ONLY WIRELESS AT THEIR HOMES HAD WE BUILD THAT INTO THAN NINE WERE VERSE NINE ONE ONE WITHOUT REQUIRING AN OPT IN THAT PEOPLE AREN'T USING. SO ANY OF YOU THAT WANT TO TAKE THEM. START AND I'LL TURN OVER% TO CHRIS BECAUSE HE CAN TELL YOU OPERATIONS THERE'S A LOT OF SHARED INFRASTRUCTURE. SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT WIRELINE WIRELESS AND ALL THESE OTHER COMMUNICATIONS A LOT OF TIMES IF YOU FALL THAT SPIDER WEB FOR THAT INFRASTRUCTURE THE BACKBONE OF HOW COMMUNICATIONS MOVE. THERE'S A VULNERABILITY POINTS THAT EXIST WITHIN THAT SHORT TERM STRUCTURE SO- TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION YOU HAVE- LAND LINES ARE WERE SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM AND ANSWER THE DIRECTOR HAD MENTIONED HERE I MEAN THAT ARE HIGH POINT WE HAD FOR OVER. CLOSE TO HALF A MILLION BEFORE FIFTY FOUR THOUSAND LANDLINES CUSTOMERS THAT'S NOT I AM NOT CORRECTION THERE'S STILL SITES NOT INDIVIDUAL SEEK MULTIPLIED BY THREE LIKE A CHRIS TALKED ABOUT THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT IN NOT HAVING THE SERVICE PROVIDERS FOR THAT THAT PORTION OF IT. AND SO WHEN THE SHARED INFRASTRUCTURES DOWN. AS CHRIS POINTED OUT HE'S HE WAS NOT ABLE TO COMMUNICATE NOT ONLY BY WIRE LESS TO SEND OUT MEMBERS MESSAGE TO EVERY PHONE OUT THERE IN HIS AREA YOU CAN DO THAT. IF THE WIRE LINE WAS DOWN HE COULDN'T REACH HIM IF THERE OF A CUSTOMER THAT BUNDLES THEIR INTERNET IN YOUR TELEVISION AND ALL THE THINGS THAT YOU HAVE. YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET BROADCAST TELEVISION SIGNAL YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET AVOID PHONE INTO YOUR HOUSE AND YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO USE YOUR INTERNET TO VALIDATE MEANING IT'S GOING ON THERE SO. YOU KNOW THE CHALLENGES HE FACED AT THE COUNTY LEVEL IN AND ALL OF YOUR CONSTITUENTS ARE IMPACTED BY IT WE'RE FACING THE SAME ISSUE IS THE ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE WAS. DIRECTLY IMPACTED BY ALL AREAS. YEAH YOU PEOPLE DON'T OPT INTO OUR SYSTEM FOR A LOT OF DIFFERENT REASONS YOU KNOW- VERY INDIVIDUAL REASONS BUT YOU KNOW IT MIGHT THEIR WITH MAY BE SUSPICIOUS OF GOVERNMENT OR THEY'RE AFRAID THAT THEY'RE GONNA GET SPAMMER. BUT THEY WERE GONNA SHARE THEIR INFORMATION WITH- YOU KNOW SOME OF THE SOME MAKETERS SOMETHING LIKE THAT YOU KNOW EVERYBODY HAS A LOT OF. DIFFERENT REASONS- WE CAN GET THE DATA AS I SAID FOR A REGULAR LINE PHONES WE GET FOR CALM FROM COMCAST NOW WE PUT THAT IN THERE. SO VERIZON EIGHTEEN T. THEY SHARE THAT INFORMATION WITH US BUT- WIRELESS COMPANIES ARE NOT REQUIRED TO DO THAT. I KNOW THAT THERE WAS A BILL RECENTLY. I THAT WAS GOING TO EXPAND THE DEFINITION I UNDERSTAND AND OF YOU KNOW TO INCLUDE WIRELESS COMPANIES IN AND REQUIRING TO SHARE THAT. WITH US. BUT I UNDERSTAND IT THAT FAILED- WE WOULD LOVE TO HAVE THAT ABILITY- WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO NOTIFY AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE- YEAH THAT NUMBERS YOU KNOW 15220% HOW OFTEN IS. NOT UNUSUAL YOU KNOW IT TOO WE- WE TALKED OR OTHER COUNTIES AROUND THE STATE THAT EXPERIENCED THE SAME KIND OF LOW LEVEL ABOUT THAT YASSER IS THIS. THE VULNERABILITY OF LAND LINES- YEAH. THE RIVERS AND NINE ONE ONE. SO I THINK WILL BE HELPFUL FOR US AND- NOT AT THIS MOMENT. IS FOLLOW UP. IF YOU HAD A MAGIC WAND WHAT WOULD BE. SOME WHAT WOULD BE THE IDEAL COMMUNICATION. ACCESS FOR. FULLER HUH. RESIDENTS RATE PAYERS- OF IMPENDING DANGER WHAT WHAT HOW DO WE CREATE THAT REDUNDANCY IDEALLY FORGETTING. ABOUT CARSON. WELL HONESTLY THEY ALL NEED TO BE ROBUST AND WE'VE DONE THAT ALL OF THE. INTERNET NEEDS TO BE UP SO WE CAN PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THERE ACTUALLY IS NOT ONE PREFERRED. SOURCE OF NOTIFYING THE PROPER PUBLIC BECAUSE IT'S VERY. INCIDENT DRIVEN YEAH BUT ONE OF THE LESSONS I GUESS IS THE NEED FOR REDUNDANCY THE SACRAMENTO AIRPORT- AND- I WON'T GET INTO THIS NOW BUT WE- WERE TRYING OUT RESPONSES TO NATURAL DISASTERS. AND PLAN TO POWER OUTAGES. THIS HEARINGS NOT ABOUT POTENTIAL SUSCEPTIBILITY TO TERRORIST EFFORTS TO KNOCK OUT THE GRID TO KNOCK OUT INFORMATION SYSTEMS. IN BED BUT OUR ABILITY TO PREPARE IN THIS INSTANCE I WOULD THINK ALSO BENEFIT SERVICE IN TERMS OF OUR BROADER- SECURITY CONCERNS BUT I KEEP THINKING CENTER. AND WE'RE GONNA MOVE TO OUR NEXT PANEL THANK YOU VERY MUCH. FOR BEING HERE TODAY. HELLO PHONE TURN A CLEARLY OKAY CENTER SKINNER DID MASS TO. KNOW WHAT HAPPENED HERE THANK YOU DEAR THANK YOU FOR THIS HEARING ARE ALSO ON A GIVE MY APPRECIATION TO THE REPRESENTS THE P. YOU SEE WHO SPOKE WELL I WASN'T SITTING ON THE DíAS I WAS LISTENING- MISTER DRILLER DO G. YOU WERE SAYING AND SPECIFIC AND I APPRECIATE IT. AND MISTER RILEY A SIMILARLY- MY DISTRICT WAS ALSO AFFECTED BY THE POWER OUTAGES AND I BRING IT UP NOT BECAUSE LIKE YOU KNOW WE'RE UNIQUE OR SOMETHING BUT AS MOST PEOPLE KNOW BE OPEN BERKELEY HILLS FIRE WAS THE MOST DAMAGING DEVASTATING AND LIKE LOS BUYER PRIOR TO. EITHER THE COFFEE OR THE PARADISE AND MUCH OF OUR SELL EQUIPMENT IS IN THE BERKELEY AND OAKLAND HILLS EXACTLY WHERE THE FIRE OCCURRED SO OF COURSE THAT IS WHERE THE POWER WAS TURNED OFF AND WHEN THEIR POWER WAS TURNED OFF THOSE VERY RESIDENTS WHO ARE MOST SUSCEPTIBLE TO A FIRE. DâN DID NOT HAVE FOR MANY OF THEM EITHER INTERNET OR SELL ACCESS TO THE VERY WAY AND WE'VE DISCUSSED THIS THAT SOMEONE IS NOTIFIED THEY NO LONGER HAD AND WE THEN WE WERE FORTUNATE WE DID NOT HAVE A SERIOUS INCIDENT BUT THERE IS A- IN LAFAYETTE WHICH IS BASED. ON THE OF THE BILLS AND IN CERTAIN EIGHT THERE WOULD FIRE. BERKELEY KENSINGTON AREA. CONTACT THE COUNTY WAS ALSO ACTED AND THEN OF COURSE THRE WAS THE FIRE IN VALLEJO THAT JUMPED THE CARQUINEZ STRAITS. IN HIT BY THE NORTHERN PART OF NORTHWESTERN PART OF CONTRA COSTA COUNTY AGAIN WITH THE POWER OUTAGES. THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE THERE DID NOT HAVE THIS ACCESS SO- SO WE KNOW THAT PLACES THAT NEED THIS CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE. WERE WITHOUT IT AND- THE MAIN BESIDES JUST BRINGING IT UP. WHEN AS WE LOOK AT REQUIRING BACK TO POWER. GIVEN WHERE MUCH OF THIS EQUIPMENT IS LOCATED TO RELY ON DIESEL GENERATORS IN THE MID IN THE PLACE WHERE WE ARE MOST SUSCEPTIBLE TO FIRE DOES NOT MAKE A LOT OF SENSE. NOW I KNOW THERE'S- DIFFICULTIES WITH- YOU KNOW A STORAGE- BATTERY STORAGE IN SUCH AS A LIMITED HOURS BUT- THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF TECHNOLOGICAL BREAKTHROUGHS AND I THINK IT'S VERY VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE REALLY LOOK AT. WHAT WHAT TECHNOLOGICAL WHAT TECHNOLOGIES ARE AVAILABLE AND WHAT BREAKTHROUGHS TO BE ABLE TO NOT BE IN A CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE WE'RE RELIANT PRIMARILY ON DIESEL GENERATION AT ESPECIALLY IN THOSE LOCATIONS THAT ARE MOST FIRE SUSCEPTIBLE. SO I WANTED TO JUST LEAVE YOU KNOW IF WE. IN THINKING ABOUT HOW WE MOVE FORWARD WHETHER THERE HAS BEEN THOUGHT TO THESE OTHER TECHNOLOGIES WHETHER IT'S WHETHER IT'S OTHER TECHNOLOGIES FOR BACKUP POWER OR WHETHER IT'S A WHOLE NOTHER COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY. WELL YOUR YOUR- IS IT YOUR POINT IS SO IMPORTANT IT'S ONE OF THOSE TOPICS TO WE HAVE BEEN. DISCUSSING COLOURED THREE- ON THE STATE SYSTEM WE USE A COMBINATION OF SOLAR PROPANE DIESEL- CURRENTLY AND I WOULD JUST SAY DURING THE PS PS ADVANCE AND THEN IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE NUMBER OF. DIESEL GENERATORS THEIR PROCURED AND NOW ARE LAID OUT THROUGHOUT THE STATE IS INCREASED TREMENDOUSLY- IT IS WHAT WE HAVE TO WORK WITH NOW BUT BUT THERE THERE CAN BE NEW TECHNOLOGY AND WE KNOW WE'VE BEEN TALKING WITH- FOLKS FROM- UNIVERSITY SYSTEMS ABOUT MAYBE DOING SOME DESIGN- AND IN THE DISCUSSIONS WERE HAVING WITH OUR TELCO PARTNERS. IS WHAT ARE SOME OF THE DIFFERENT WAYS THAT WE CAN LOOK TO ADDRESS THIS NOT AN EASY SOLUTION YET OR SOMETHING THAT COULD BE HAPPEN REALLY FAST BUT IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE ARE DISCUSSING AND WE'RE TRYING TO FIND AND WHERE WE CAN PARTICULARLY SOLAR. AND RENEWABLE- IS AREA WERE FOLK ON. THANK YOU KNOW WHAT'S IT WILL LAST LONG TIME THAT MEAN YOUR BATTERIES NOW THAT WITH ENOUGH SOLAR CAM CAN YOU KNOW KEEP KEEP I THINK POWER FOR QUITE A LONG TIME DEL. OKAY THANK YOU. WE'RE GONNA- NOW HEAR FROM THE TELEPHONE TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROVIDERS AND THEIR- RESPONSES TO THE OUTAGES AND THE LESSONS LEARNED AND- HOPEFULLY WHAT THEY- PLAN TO IMPROVE. THE DELIVERY OF SERVICE EACH JOB. IF WE CAN HAVE- EVERYONE JUST COME FORWARD WE CAN HAVE A STEVE CARLSON WITH THE WIRELESS ASSOCIATION JEFF LONG. WITH. THE WITH A. T. AND T. CONSIDER MINUS WITH VERIZON. AND I'M AN S. CAROLINE MCINTYRE IF YOU CAN ALSO COME UP AND BE PART OF THIS PANEL WITH THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS ASSOCIATION AND JOHN LUNDGREN WITH THE VOLCANO TELEPHONE IF YOU CAN ALSO JOIN THIS PANEL CHAIR MEMBERS- ON BEHALF OF C. T. I A AND CALIFORNIA'S WIRELESS INDUSTRY WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO APPEAR BEFORE YOU TODAY. OUR COMPANIES ARE AN INTEGRAL PART OF CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMIC ENGINE SUPPORTING SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND WIRELESS RELATED JOBS AND SEVENTY THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN ANNUAL ECONOMIC PRODUCTIVITY. BUT MORE THAN THAT WE ARE ALSO PROUD TO BE CALIFORNIA'S CONNECTIVE TISSUE. CONNECTING AN EMPOWERING MORE THAN FORTY MILLION PEOPLE IN EVERY DIVERSE COMMUNITY ACROSS THE NATION'S LARGEST STATE. OUR BUSINESS IS CONNECTING CALIFORNIA AND LIKE EVERY INDUSTRY IN THE STATE OURS WAS IMPACTED BY A HISTORICALLY UNPRECEDENTED SERVICE OF POWER OUTAGES IN UNIQUE AND OFTEN UNPREDICTABLE WAYS. AND YET IN THE FACE OF THE MENTAL POWER CHALLENGES ARE CALIFORNIA COMPANIES WORKED AROUND THE CLOCK TO DO EVERYTHING IN THEIR POWER TO KEEP OUR CALIFORNIA ASSETS OPERATIONAL. INCLUDING ALL HANDS DEPLOYMENT OF TECHNICAL PERSONNEL AND EMERGENCY ASSETS DRAW NOT JUST FROM EVERY CORNER OF CALIFORNIA BUT AS YOU HEARD IN SOME CASES FROM ACROSS THE COUNTRY. AS MIGHT BE EXPECTED THE MAGNITUDE AND THE UNIQUENESS OF THE EVENTS PRESENTED CHALLENGES. BUT I CAN ASSURE ALL OF YOU. FOR THE SAKE OF THE MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIA HOUSEHOLDS AND BUSINESSES WHO RELY ON US EVERY DAY. TO REACH ONE ANOTHER. THIS INDUSTRY STANDS READY TO SHARE LESSONS LEARNED AND TO WORK WITH THIS LEGISLATURE BUT WE ASK YOU SEE AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS. AS CONSTRUCTIVE WORKING PARTNERS TO BETTER PREPARE OUR STATE ON OUR NETWORKS FOR FUTURE EVENTS AND THE UNPRECEDENTED NEW NORMAL OF P. S. P. S. WE ARE PLEASED TO BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE. TO HEAR FROM STATE AND LOCAL PARTIES AS WELL AS TO PROVIDE INFORMATION THAT MAY BE NEW. TO MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. AS I INDICATED AS YOU HEARD. PS PS ADVANCE FOR UNPRECEDENTED IN THE MOST EXTENSIVE IN CALIFORNIA'S HISTORY. RESPONDING TO THESE ON PRESIDENT OUTAGES WAS A COLOSSAL TASK IT WIRELESS CARRIERS WERE ABLE TO LARGELY MAINTAIN SERVICES WITH THOUSANDS OF TECHNICIANS WORKING AROUND THE CLOCK. TO DEPLOY EMERGENCY ASSETS ACROSS THE STATE. THE WIRELESS INDUSTRY SUPPORTS THE COMMITTEE'S INTEREST IN GOAL IN BETTER UNDERSTANDING THE CHALLENGES THAT AROSE FROM THE P. S. P. S. EVENTS. AND AS WE LOOK TOGETHER FOR HOW TO ADDRESS THEM IN THE FUTURE THERE ARE SOME BASELINE FACTS REGARDING THESE EVENTS. THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO SHARE. FOR EXAMPLE THE FCC'S COMMUNICATION STATUS REPORTS SHOW THAT 96% OF CELL SITES THROUGHOUT THE AFFECTED AREAS. REMAINED OPERATIONAL. DESPITE THE FACT THAT OVER TWO POINT SEVEN MILLION CALIFORNIANS WERE WITHOUT POWER. SIMULTANEOUSLY SHUTTING OFF POWER TO A LARGE PORTION OF THE STATE AT TIMES REACHING MORE THAN HALF OF CALIFORNIA'S FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES PLACED ON HEARD OF CONSTRAINTS AND TELECOM AN EXISTING RESOURCES. MAINTAIN POWER BARS FACILITIES WITH A MOVING TARGET AS THE NATURE AND MAGNITUDE OF THE PS PS EVENTS MADE IT EXTREMELY DIFFICULT FOR ALL INVOLVED. PUBLIC SAFETY GOVERNMENT BUSINESS TO KNOW EXACTLY WHEN AND WHERE THE SHUT OUTS WOULD OCCUR AND FOR HOW LONG THEY WOULD CONTINUE. AS NOTED WIRELESS NETWORKS ARE DESIGNED WITH NUMEROUS OVERLAPPING CELL SITES THAT MAY PROVIDE MAXIMUM CAPACITY AND CONTINUITY OF SERVICE EVEN WHEN AN INDIVIDUAL SITE AS AN OPERABLE. COMMERCIAL POWER IS CRITICAL TO PROVIDING TELECOM SERVICES AND COMPREHENSIVE BACK POWERS BACKUP POWER SYSTEMS ARE REQUIRED TO MEET A VARIETY OF NEEDS AND A VARIETY OF CIRCUMSTANCES. EVERY NETWORK IS UNIQUELY DESIGNED AND POWER FAILURES ESPECIALLY THOSE OF THE MAGNITUDE OF P. S. P. S. CANNOT BE SOLVED BY A ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH. MOST FACILITIES HAVE BATTERY BACKUP SOLUTIONS WHILE FIX GENERATORS ARE OFTEN PERMANENTLY INSTALLED AT SITES WERE STRICTLY FEASIBLE. PERMITTED BY STATE AND LOCAL LAWS IN STATE TO DO SO. IN ADDITION PORTABLE GENERATORS ALLOW LONG TERM AND FLEXIBLE POWER TO BE RAPIDLY DEPLOYED TO STRATEGIC HIGH PRIORITY SITES. INCLUDING THOSE SERVING THE GREATEST NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS. THROUGHOUT THE PS PS PROCESS CARRIERS FOLLOWED ESTABLISHED PROTOCOLS AND PROVIDED DETAILED STATUS OF PLATES THREE TIMES A DAY. TO THE CALIFORNIA UTILITIES EMERGENCY ASSOCIATION EMBEDDED WITHIN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES. PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SUPPORT TO VICTIMS OF WILDFIRES CARE IS ALSO ESTABLISHED RESOURCES AT EVACUATION CENTERS ACROSS THE STATE WITH ON SITE CHARGING STATIONS ACCESS TO VOICE IN MY FIVE SERVICES AND OTHER CUSTOMER SUPPORT AS WELL AS PROVIDING ADDITIONAL SUPPORT. TO PUBLIC SAFETY ENTITIES. CARE IS ALSO A OFFERED UNLIMITED VOICE TEXT AND DATA SERVICES TO AFFECTED CUSTOMERS BY OFFERING CREDITS AND OR WAVING OVERAGE CHARGES. AS MOST OF THE STATE LEARNS HOW TO BETTER COPE WITH THE SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS OF SIGNIFICANT POWER SHUTDOWNS. CARRIERS TO OUR LEARNING HOW TO ADAPT TO REGULAR ON AVAILABILITY OF COMMERCIAL POWER AND HOW BEST TO MAINTAIN NETWORK OPERATIONS UNDER SUCH PREVIOUSLY EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES. AS ONE RECOMMENDATION TO BUILD ON GOING FORWARD WE WOULD SUGGEST AND AS WE'VE HEARD AND ACTUALLY WAS VERY PLEASED TO HEAR FROM- FROM FROM BUT- DIRECTOR GUARD TO CHEAP. OUT FROM PRESIDENT BACHELOR. THAT PUBLIC SAFETY AGENCIES REGULATORS OTHER STAKEHOLDERS SIT DOWN TOGETHER AND IDENTIFY HOW WE CAN MOST SUCCESSFULLY WORK IN PARTNERSHIP DURING FUTURE SET UP. NOT NECESSARILY IN SITUATIONS LIKE THIS WHICH IS REQUIRED- OVERSIGHT. BUT INFORMALLY AROUND THE TABLE OKAY WHAT DID YOU SEE HOW TO JUST SEE WHAT WORKED WHAT DIDN'T. BECAUSE WHEN WE GET IT IN THE PROCEEDINGS CIRCUMSTANCE WERE IN FRONT OF A COMMITTEE- THE ABILITY TO KIND OF- TO ENGAGE IN IN THAT THE KIND OF DIALOGUE THAT WE THINK IS REALLY THE WAY TO DO THIS SOMETIMES. SOMETIMES IS LACKING. SO WITH THAT WE ARE COMMITTED TO CONTINUE OUR WORK TOGETHER WITH THE STATE TO REPLACE IDENTIFIED OBSTACLES AND I DID. ALSO WANTED TO POINT OUT THAT THE SUGGESTION OF STREAMLINING WAS VERY IMPORTANT WE THINK AS WE TRY TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS WE HAD AND THE AND THE OBSTACLES WE HAD STREAMLINING. THE APPROACH TO BE ABLE TO DO WITH THAT I THINK IT'S Vç IS VERY IMPORTANT. AND THE OTHER ISSUE I DIDN'T WANT A PLAYOFF AND A AND THE- CHAIR WEST SO WAS VERY MUCH INVOLVED WITH THIS IS THE ABILITY TO BRING ON NEW INFRASTRUCTURE NOT JUST UPGRADE THE EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE BUT- AS YOU BRING A NEW INFRASTRUCTURE YOU CREATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO- TO PUT. SERVICE IN AREAS WHERE OTHERS MAY BE MAY GO DOWN- THAT STILL A REAL CHALLENGE AND IT'S A BIG CHALLENGE AND SOME OF THE AREAS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE WANTED T. THAT UP- FOR THE GROUP ANYWAY- WANTED TO. THIS OVER TO OUR OUR WITNESSES PEOPLE WHO HAVE DEALT WITH THIS ON THE GROUND LET ME START WITH JEFF LEON OF EIGHTEEN T. GOOD MORNING CHAIR AT. MY NAME IS JEFF LONG I'M THE VICE PRESIDENT OF ACCESS CONSTRUCTION AND ENGINEERING FOR EIGHTEEN ANTI. MY TEAM IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PLANNING ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION MAINTENANCE AND OPERATION OF WIRELESS AND WIRELINE FACILITIES. ACROSS THE WESTERN UNITED STATES INCLUDING CALIFORNIA. I PREVIOUSLY HAD NATION WIDE RESPONSIBILITY FOR WIRELESS BUILD AN OPERATIONS WHICH INCLUDES DISASTER RECOVERY. IN THE AFTERMATH OF MANY NATURAL DISASTERS INCLUDING HURRICANE MARIA SANDY. AND THE CALIFORNIA WILDFIRES OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS AND EVERYTHING ELSE IN BETWEEN. THANK YOU FOR CONVENING THIS HEARING I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE BEFORE YOU TODAY. AT THE OUTSET I WANT TO SAY THAT WE ARE COMMITTED TO PROVIDING COMMUNICATION SERVICES THAT THE PUBLIC. AND PUBLIC SAFETY AGENCY CAN RELY ON. EIGHTEEN T. HAS OPERATED IN CALIFORNIA FOR OVER ON YOU FORTY YEARS. WE HAVE WORKED THROUGH MANY EMERGENCIES. AND ENGAGE WITH THE PUBLIC ON EVERY LEVEL. I'LL TELL YOU THAT FROM MY TEAMS PERSPECTIVE WE HAVE THAT HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE WORKING TIRELESSLY. BEFORE DURING AND AFTER EACH OF THESE EVENTS TO DEPLOY HUNDREDS OF ASSETS ENSURING THAT WE HAVE GREATER RELIABILITY LEVENTIS THAT. I AGREE WITH EVERYTHING STEVE SAID I WANT TO PROVIDE SOME INSIGHT ON WHAT EIGHTEEN T. DOING TO DEAL WITH THE NEW NORMAL FOR THE FUTURE OF P. S. P. S. EVENTS. AT SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE. LET ME BE BRIEF TOP BUT THREE ACTIONS THAT WE'RE TAKING. FIRST. WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED REPORTING PROTOCOLS IN ACCORDANCE WITH SB FIVE SIXTY AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK OF OUR PUBLIC SAFETY PARTNERS ON ENGAGEMENT DURING DISASTERS THIS WILL INCLUDE DISCUSSIONS WITH ELECTED OFFICIALS STATE COUNTY TRIBAL EMERGENCY RESPONSE PERSONNEL. WORKING WITH THE CALIFORNIA UTILITY EMERGENCY ASSOCIATION. ON COMMUNICATIONS STATE AND THE HEARING WILL ALSO WORK WITH THE POWER COMPANIES TO ENSURE THAT TIMELY ACCURATE CRITICAL INFORMATION IS RECEIVED TO IMPROVE OUR RESPONSE GOING FORWARD. SECOND. WE HAVE CONVENE AN EXECUTIVE LEVEL STRIKE FORCE TO ENHANCE NETWORK RELIABILITY FOR THE NEXT FAR SEASON ACTIONS TRIGGERED INCLUDE INCREASED DEPLOYMENT OF FIX GENERATORS AUGMENTING HUNDREDS OF EXISTING CRITICAL SITES AND AT STEVE MENTION ALSO BUILDING HUNDREDS OF NEW CELL SITES WOULD FIX GENERATORS. ORDERS WERE ALREADY PLACE FOR HUNDREDS OF ADDITIONAL PORTABLE GENERATORS WE MANUFACTURE COMMITMENT TO START DELIVERY. IN THE COMING MONTHS. BATTERY ENHANCEMENTS. AUTOMATION INCLUDING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR POWER MANAGEMENT CAPABILITIES ALSO ON THE WAY. IN THE RECENT PS PS THE VENTS MY TEAM WORKS HARD TO MAINTAIN COMMUNICATIONS ULTIMATELY ACHIEVING WIRELESS COVERAGE AT 97% OF NORMAL WITHIN THAT THIRTY FOUR AFFECT THE COUNTIES DURING THE PEAK HOLIDAY IN OCTOBER. HOWEVER OUR GOAL IS ALWAYS A 100% SO WE NEED TO BE THE- BEST A MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE. GIVEN THE ACTIONS THAT WE HAVE TAKEN. IF THE SAME INCIDENT WERE TO OCCUR IN TWENTY TWENTY WE WILL BE EVEN BETTER PREPARED TO RESPOND. FINALLY. WE ARE PREPARED TO DRAMATICALLY IN WE INCREASE CAPITAL INVESTMENT TO TRANSFORM OUR NETWORK IN RESPONSE TO THIS NEW NORMAL OF MASSIVE POWER SHUT OFFS. OUR GOAL WE HOPE OUR COMMERCIAL POWER COMPANIES WILL BE MORE LIMITED. AND PRECISE IN HOW THE IMPLEMENT P. S. P. S. EVENTS GOING FORWARD WE STRIVE TO HAVE A ROBUST NETWORK THAT WILL WITHSTAND THE SCALE OF OUTAGES THAT WE EXPERIENCE IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. OUR PLAN IS TO BUILD OVER EIGHT THOUSAND ADDITIONAL FIX GENERATORS. AT OTHER ALTERNATIVE POWER RESOURCES AT NEW YOU AN EXISTING CELL SITES. THE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE IN OBTAINING PERMITS FOR OVER A THOUSAND NEW GENERATORS IS A MONUMENTAL UNDERTAKING. DUE TO INCONSISTENT REQUIREMENTS ACROSS JURISDICTIONS LINK THE REVIEW TIMES OWNERS AND WE DONE THEM PERMITTING CONDITIONS WE EXPECT IT COULD TAKE THREE TO FIVE YEARS TO GET ALL THOSE GENERATORS PERMIT BUILT AN OPERATIONAL. WE WOULD LIKE TO GO FASTER. AND WE WANT TO GO FASTER BUT THAT WOULD TAKE SOME CHANGES IN THE CURRENT PERMITTING STRUCTURE. THE CIVIC LEE WE BELIEVE THAT SOME TARGETED PERMITTING. TARGETED PERMITTING STREAMLINING EFFORTS FOR STANDARDIZED FIX GENERATORS. COULD ALLOW US TO COMPLETE THE BILL OF ALL FIX GENERATOR SITES WITHIN ONE TO THREE YEARS. EIGHTEEN ANTI IS ALSO EXPLORING INNOVATIVE ALTERNATIVE ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES INCLUDING HOW YOU DOING FUEL CELLS AND SOLAR POWER. LET ME CONCLUDE BY SAYING AGAIN THANK YOU FOR CONVENING THE DISCUSSION TODAY WE APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS. AT AND T. IS PREPARED TO HELP MEET THE EXTRAORDINARY CHALLENGES. CALIFORNIA FACES WE HAVE INVESTED AND ARE PREPARED TO IMPROVE OUR NETWORK RELIABILITY FOR THE NEXT FAR SEASON FURTHER WE ARE READY TO INCREASE INVESTMENT TO TRANSFORM OUR NETWORK TO ADDRESS WIDESPREAD PS PS EVENTS. EIGHTEEN ANTI WILL CONTINUE TO ACHIEVE IMPROVE RESULTS FOR OUR CUSTOMERS AND YOUR CONSTITUENTS IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT WE IMPROVE COLLABORATION AND CLOUT AND COOPERATION AMONGST THE AGENCIES ELECTED OFFICIALS OUR CUSTOMERS AND TELECOMMUNICATION INDUSTRIES THANK YOU. THE MORNING- MISTER CHAIR GOOD MORNING SENATORS- MY NAME'S HAS HIS FROM MINE I'M THE CHIEF LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL FOR VERIZON I HAVE NEXT TO ME AT MY RIGHT TO IT IS SAW SCOTT STEWART HE'S OUR NETWORK ENGINEER HE BUILT OUR SYSTEM WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR. A MORE TECHNICAL QUESTIONS I ALSO WANT TO THANK OUR PARTNERS IN GOVERNMENT- DIRECTOR GERD DO SHE FOR HIS COMMENTS AND PRESIDENT BACHELOR FOR HER COMMENTS ALONG WITH THE REST OF THE PANELISTS- WE ARE IN A SITUATION OF ON PRESIDENTE AT- POWER SHUT OFF THIS IS SOMETHING NEW WE DID NOT EXPERIENCED US IN THE PAST TO THE EXTENT THAT WE HAD THIS PAST YEAR. BOB ARISES IT WAS A VERY PROUD YES THE DAY. ABOUT HOW OUR NETWORK CONTINUE TO SERVE OUR CUSTOMERS DURING- THESE PROACTIVE SHOT OFFICE IN OCTOBER. I WANT TO NOW VERIZON'S STEPPED UP. NUMBER ONE IS WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN PROACTIVE BUT EVEN MORE PROACTIVE IN PREPARING OUR NETWORK WITH BACKUP POWER SOURCES ALL OF OUR MACROS WHICH PROVIDE THE COVERAGE FOR CONNECTIVITY HAVE BACKUP POWER SOURCES AND MOST OF THEM HAVE GENERATORS THAT PROVIDE BOB BACKUP POWER FOR TWENTY FOUR TO SEVENTY TWO HOURS. WE WERE ALSO VERY PROACTIVE IN COMMUNICATING WITH STAKEHOLDERS ABOUT THE POTENTIAL IMPACTS OF THE NETWORK SO WHILE OUR NETWORK IS. VERY RESILIENT WITH BACKUP POWER SOURCES WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN CERTAIN DISCRETE AREAS THAT- WILL SUFFER DEGRADATION OR LOSS OF POWER DURING A POWER OUTAGE I'M ONE OF THOSE PLACES ARE A CENTER SKINNER IN THE BERKELEY HILLS- OAKLAND HILLS- WE ACTUALLY HAVE BEEN THINKING ABOUT THAT QUITE A BIT AND COME UP WITH A SOLUTION FOR THAT. I'M AFRAID YOU MIGHT OF THROWING A LITTLE BIT OF COLD WATER ON OUR SOLUTION BOB IT'S COUPLE TO SPEAK TO WITHOUT A LITTLE LATER. WE AT OURSELVES WITH- SO IN TERMS OF THE PROACTIVE COMMUNICATING- WE ARE. SPOKE WITH CALLOW YES PRIOR TO THE POWER SHUT OFF WE SPOKE WITH- DIFFERENT LEGISLATORS. WITH CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS WITH LOCAL YOU'LL SEIZE ABOUT WHERE WE WOULD EXPECT TO HAVE SOME POTENTIAL. IMPACTS ON OUR NETWORK. THIS WAS SOMETHING NEW FOR US OUR- UNDERSTANDING HOW WIDESPREAD. THIS POWER OUTAGE WAS GOING TO BE WE SAID THIS IS NOT A TIME FOR US TO. TO WAIT AND REACT WE HAVE TO BE PROACTIVE SO WE ACTUALLY WENT OUT AND SPOKE WITH- A LOT OF FOLKS AND LET THEM KNOW. EXIT THE FOLS ABOUT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN ON OUR NETWORK. IN THAT IT OURSELVES A CALLOW YES STATE OPERATIONS CENTER AND OPENLY AND CONSISTENTLY COMMUNICATE WITH CARILLO YES TO PROVIDE THEM REAL TIME- MISSION CRITICAL INFORMATION. IN FACT ON DAY ONE- WE HAD A FELLOW NAMED JOHN LAWLER AT FOUR PM AVAILABLE FOR THE BRIEFING THAT CALLOW YES HAD ONE DAY TRIGGERED. THEIR LEVEL ONE OUR STATE OPERATIONS CENTER SO AND I KNOW PRESIDENT BACHELOR- MENTIONED THAT THERE WERE VERY FEW PEOPLE THERE- THAT VERY FIRST DAY WELL WE WERE ONE OF THE FEW THAT WERE THERE. WEEK HELLO YES INFORMED THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE TO INFORM THE CPUC INFORMED- ALONG WITH OTHER STRAIGHT STAKEHOLDERS ON A DAILY BASIS AS TO THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR NETWORK I WAS ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT WE WERE TOLD THAT THIS PANEL TODAY WAS GOING TO ASK AS WE KNOW HOW WELL WERE YOU COMMUNICATING WITH THE DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS VERIZON PRIDES ITSELF IN THE FACT THAT NOT ONLY DID IT PROACTIVELY COMMUNICATE BUT IT COMMUNICATED- DURING THE DAY ON REQUEST TWO OR THREE TIMES A DAY WE WILL PROVIDE CALLOW BUSES ARE UP. ON A REAL TIME BASIS AT THE TOP ACT WE PROVIDE AID END OF DAY COMMUNICATIONS TO ALL THE CYCLE. WE ALSO RAISE THE BAR ON TRANSPARENCY BY PROVIDING PUBLICLY THE PERCENTAGE OF CELL SITES IN OPERATIONS IN THE IMPACTED. OUR POWER SHUT OFF AREAS IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WE DID BEFORE- WE MADE A CORPORATE DECISION THAT WE WERE GOING TO BE MORE TRANSPARENT. ABOUT THIS AND BY ON A GOING FORWARD BASIS WE INTEND TO BE TRANSPARENT. THE RESULTS OF ALL OF OUR WORK WAS THAT OUR NETWORK. SHOWED GREAT RESILIENCY DUE TO OUR BACK UP POWER RESOURCES ARE OVERLAPPING CELL SITE DESIGN. AND ARE RUNNING TO THE CRISIS WITH THE DEPLOYMENT OF TEMPORARY ASSETS SUCH AS CAL'S COLD SPOTS IN PORTABLE GENERATORS WERE NEEDED. AND SO PART OF THE RESULTS WAS FOR EXAMPLE AT THE HEIGHT OF THE VENTS ON OCTOBER TWENTY EIGHTH. THE FCC REPORTED ON AGGREGATE 27% OF WIRELESS SERVICE CELL SITES WERE OUT OF SERVICE AND SOMEONE COUNTY. THE TO THE POWERSHOT AWESOME WELL VERIZON ONLY EXPERIENCE 7% OF SITES OUT OF SERVICE AT THE TIME. NOW THAT 7% IS NOT SOMETHING TO CROW ABOUT- BECAUSE WE HAVE TO DO BETTER AND WE OF KNOWLEDGE THAT. BUT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO SAY IS OUR RESILIENCY ACTUALLY SHOWED UP% IN THE NUMBERS. THE SAME IS FOR MARIN COUNTY MARIN COUNTY THERE WAS A 57% CELL SITES OUT OF SERVICE ACCORDING TO THE- DERS REPORTS. ARISES OUT OF SERVICE WAS 8% OF ITS CELL SITES BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT COVERAGE WAS AL. BECAUSE WE HAVE THIS OVERLAP IN THE SIGN AND WE HAVE THE TEMPORARY ASSETS THAT WE DEPLOY. AND THAT'S AN IMPORTANT METRIC THAT WE NEED TO DISCUSS IN THIS COLLABORATIVE. AS WE GO FORWARD IN A COLLABORATIVE MANNER IS WHAT DOES IT REALLY MEAN FOR CELL SITE TO BE OUT DOES THAT MEAN THAT COVERAGES OUT. NOT NECESSARILY AND SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO REALLY BE CAREFUL ABOUT EQUATING CELL SITES OUT WITH COVERAGE OUT. WE THINK THAT THERE IS A REAL NEED FOR PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN INDUSTRY THE ELECTRIC UTILITIES AND GOVERNMENT AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS TO COME UP WITH SOLUTIONS TO THE- PRESIDENTE CHALLENGES CLIMATE CHANGE HAS IMPOSED ON CALIFORNIA WE ARE PREPARED TO PARTNER WITH CALIFORNIA TO DEVELOP THE SENSIBLE AND FEASIBLE SOLUTIONS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND I FORGOT TO CLARIFY THAT MISTER CARLSON MISTER LONG AND MR AMMAN. ARE REPRESENTING THE WIRELESS INDUSTRY WE HAVE CAROLINE MACINTYRE REPRESENTING THE CABLE INDUSTRY AND- JOHN LUNDGREN. IS REPRESENTING WIRELESS LINE SO NOW WE'LL HEAR FROM CARE A MISS MCINTYRE AND THEN MISTER. LONGER. ABSOLUTELY AS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS CAROLINE MCINTYRE IN BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CABLE AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THE COMMITTEE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION'S MEMBERS WE GREATLY APPRECIATE THE DIALOGUE WE UNDERSTAND HOW. WE CAN PROVIDE TECHNICAL EXPERTISE AND WORK TOGETHER ON THE PRACTICAL REALISTIC AND WORKABLE SOLUTIONS FOR KEEPING CALIFORNIA'S SAFE. AT THE CABLE INDUSTRY HAS INVESTED BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO BUILD AND MAINTAIN STATE OF THE ART COMMUNICATIONS NETWORKS CAPABLE OF DELIVERING SUPERIOR BROADBAND VIDEO INVOICE SERVICE FOR CALIFORNIANS. WHETHER EXPANDING NETWORKS TO PROVIDE FASTER BROADBAND OFFERING HIGH SPEED VALUE WIRELINE VOICE SERVICE AND MOBILE SERVICES OR DELIVERING VIDEO PROGRAMMING THE MEMBERS THE CC TA CONTINUE TO INNOVATE AND INVEST IN THE NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE BENEFITING CALIFORNIANS. ALL OF THE CTA'S MEMBERS TAKE NETWORK RELIABILITY VERY SERIOUSLY AND WORK HARD TO ENSURE OUR BACK UP SERVICE IN THE EVENT OF COMMERCIAL POWER OUTAGE IS. THE ELECTRIC UTILITY P. S. P. S. C. VETS LAST YEAR WERE UNPRECEDENTED IN SCOPE SCALE AND HAVE SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE STATE'S COMMUNICATIONS NETWORKS THAT RELY ON COMMERCIAL POWER. WE AGREE WITH THE GOVERNOR THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES THE CPUC THE MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE THAT WHAT HAPPENED LAST YEAR CANNOT HAPPEN AGAIN. THE CABLE INDUSTRY IS COMMITTED TO FINDING SOLUTIONS THERE ARE SEVERAL KEY PRINCIPLES THAT WE VIEW WAS FUNDAMENTAL TO UNDERSTANDING THE CHALLENGES AND FINDING EFFECTIVE SOLUTIONS TO SUPPORT PUBLIC SAFETY. IN A P. S. P. S. OR OTHER EMERGENCY. LET ME JUST START BY SAYING THAT IT IS UNFAIR AND UNREASONABLE FOR THE LEGISLATURE AND THE CPC TO ALLOW THE ELECTRIC UTILITIES TO DE ENERGIZED THEIR NETWORKS AND EXPECT THAT THE COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK IS GOING TO BECOME A WHOLESALE REPLACEMENT. FOR POWER 21100% OUR THE COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK. THE COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK IS IN FACT DEPENDENT UPON COMMERCIAL POWER AND WHILE WE DO HAVE BACKUP POWER IN PLACE TO SUPPORT MOST OF OUR FACILITIES BATTERIES AND THEN GENERATORS WE CANNOT BE EXPECTED TO KEEP UP 1100% OF THE NETWORK UNLESS YOU ARE WILLING TO ACKNOWLEDGE AND MAKE CERTAIN CONCESSIONS FOR CHALLENGES THAT WE BUT HAVE DOING CELL WE ARE COMMITTED TO KEEPING POWER AND CAPABLE OF KEEPING POWER UP TO OUR MAIN FACILITIES ARE HEAD ENDS. KEEP BEING AT THE BACK HOME POWER FOR- WIRELESS SERVICES TO SUPPORT CELL TOWERS I'VE BEEN READING TO SUPPORT FIRST RESPONDERS TO SUPPORT CRITICAL FACILITIES ALL THROUGH AN IDENTIFICATION PROCESS IN COORDINATION WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENT BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU ARE EXPECTING THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO KEEP 1100% OF RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMERS. CAN DID AND HAVING THE ABILITY TO HAVE CONTENT AS MEDICATION YOU HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT ARE CHALLENGES WITH. THE I AS I INDICATED THE K. YLIDES DO IN FACT HAVE BACKUP BATTERIES THE FACILITIES THAT ACTUALLY PROVIDE THAT LAST MILE CONNECTIVE ITTY TO THE RESIDENTIAL CONSUMER WILL IN FACT LAST ON BACK UP BATTERY POWER FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. THERE AFTER YOU WERE GOING TO HAVE TO BRING IN PORTABLE GENERATORS OR OTHER SOURCES OF POWER IN ORDER TO POWER THAT NETWORK WE CALL THOSE FACILITIES THAT ARE PROVIDING THAT LAST MILE CONNECTIVE ITTY. AND UPLOAD. WE HAVE. IN EXCESS OF FIFTY THOUSAND NOTES THAT ARE PART OF THE CABLE NETWORKS IN CALIFORNIA. ONE NOTE SERVES APPROXIMATELY THREE HUNDRED HOUSEHOLDS THAT IS TWO HUNDRED PORTABLE GENERATORS THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO BRING INTO A COMMUNITY TO ENSURE THAT POWER CONTINUES TO BE AVAILABLE TO THAT NETWORK INTO THAT RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMERS HOW. EVEN IF WE ARE CAPABLE OF DOING THAT. THERE ARE STILL CHALLENGES WITH WHETHER OR NOT THE CONSUMER WOULD BE ABLE TO ACTUALLY UTILIZE THE SERVICE ONE THEY MUST HAVE A BACK UP BATTERY FOR THE VEAL PIE V. O. I. P. SYSTEM SECONDLY MOST CONSUMERS ARE ALSO GOING TO BE DEPENDED UPON SOME SORT OF ENERGY SOURCE IN THEIR HOME TO POWER. THEIR COMMUNICATION DEVICE. I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THE GHETTO POT SYSTEM I AM TALKING ABOUT THAT TELEPHONE SYSTEM THAT MANY VOID CUSTOMERS COMMUNICATE OVER THAT MAY BE A CORDLESS PHONE OR SOME OTHER TYPE OF INSTRUMENT THAT DEPENDS ON ELECTRICITY. IN ADDITION JUST TO GET THOSE PORTABLE GENERATORS OUT TO THOSE COMMUNITIES WE'VE GOT ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES WE'VE GOT NAME BE ISSUES WE'VE GOT INCONSISTENCIES WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS VERY MISSION GOALS. THERE ARE MANY MANY CHALLENGES SO WE ASK THAT AS WE COLLECTIVELY LOOK TO FIND SOLUTIONS IN A SPACE THAT WE TAKE ALL OF THOSE FACTORS INTO CONSIDERATION. OUR PRIORITY RECOGNIZING THAT 80% OF THE CALLS THAT GO INTO NINE ONE ONE ARE COMING FROM WIRELESS NETWORKS WE HAVE MADE PROVIDING BACKUP POWER TO THE BACK HOME NETWORK THAT SUPPORTS THE CELL SYSTEM OUR PRIORITY. TO PROVIDE AS MUCH CERTAINTY ON OUR END IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THE CONNECTIVE ITTY IS ULTIMATELY THERE THAT WOULD BE NEEDED BY THE WIRELESS COMPANIES TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE THEIR SERVICE. THERE IS NO ONE SIZE FITS ALL SOLUTION HERE- AS COMMISSIONER I'M SORRY DIRECTOR GIRLY DID YOU MENTIONED EARLIER- OUR INDUSTRY HAS BEEN IN COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES- OUR COMPANIES ALSO HAVE LOCAL PUBLIC AFFAIRS FOLKS THAT ARE. ALWAYS IN CONTACT WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND WE ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO CONTINUING OUR COLLABORATION TO WORK WITH- WE ASKED TO FIGURE OUT THE BEST- REPORTING PROTOCOLS AND PARTNERSHIPS WITH- WITH- YES AND OTHER LOCAL GOVERNMENT PARTNERS. AND MANY OF THE CURRENT LAWS THAT ARE ON THE BOOKS ALREADY PROVIDE AN ADEQUATE FRAMEWORK FOR US TO MAKE SOME IMPROVEMENTS IN THIS SPACE INCLUDING CENTER MAGUIRE'S SB SIX SEVENTY WHICH I WE **** IN THE PROCESS OF. AS DEVELOPING REGULATIONS THE LEADERSHIP OF LOCAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT OFFICIALS IS ALSO GOING TO BE VERY IMPORTANT IN THIS SPACE IN THAT WE NEED TO WORK WITH PHÃN COLLABORATIVE LEAD TO IDENTIFY THOSE CRITICAL FACILITIES AND OTHER LOCAL PUBLIC SAFETY PRIORITIES THAT WE MESSED IT MIGHT MUST FOCUS ON DURING A P. S. P. S. OR OTHER EMERGENCY. CABLE OPERATORS CAN HELP PROVIDE SOLUTIONS TO MEET THE INDIVIDUAL COUNTY NEEDS AND THEIR COMMUNITIES PRIORITIES BASED ON THE MOST RELIABLE AND ASSESSABLE TECHNOLOGIES WE LOOK FORWARD TO COLLABORATING- WITH THOSE AGENCIES AS I INDICATED AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU MISTER ALONG WITH. HELLO THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK SENATORS- MY NAME IS JOHN LUNDGREN HIRING DIRECTOR NETWORK SERVICES VICE PRESIDENT WALKING A TELEPHONE COMPANY- I'VE BEEN ASKED TO SPEAK FROM A SMALL LOCAL STRANGER PERSPECTIVE TODAY AND HOW IT AFFECTS US IN THESE SITUATIONS. GIVE A LITTLE BACKGROUND VOLCANO- IS FIFTY FIVE MILES SOUTHEAST OF SACRAMENTO NOT VERY FAR FROM HERE ANSWERS FOUR HUNDRED SIXTEEN SQUARE MILES MUCH OF WHICH IS HIGHER FOOT HILL AREAS TO VERY MOUNTAINOUS AREAS WE HAVE NINE THOUSAND TELEPHONE ACCESS LINES SEVENTY THREE HUNDRED DSL INTERNET CUSTOMERS CURRENTLY ABOUT 10% OF OUR BASES SERVE WITH FIBER DIRECTOR HOME. BOB WE SERVE THE EASTERN PART OF AMADOR COUNTY TO THE KIRKWOOD SKI AREA- IN THE MOUNTAINS HAND ALSO SERVE VERY SMALL PORTIONS OF ELDORADO ALPINE COUNTY. IN ADDITION WE SERVE NORTHERN PORTIONS OF CALAVERAS COUNTY. IT'S THE OTHER SMALL WORKS IN THE STATE ARE VERY SIMILAR IN NATURE TO THE TRAIN AND CANARIES THEY COVER AND MANY OF A REPRESENT IN THIS ROOM THIS MORNING BECAUSE THEY FEEL THIS IS THE- IMPORTANT. SITUATION. TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE FLAVOR WE HAVE ALMOST TWO HUNDRED SPERRY SMALL REMOTES TO SERVE OUR CUSTOMER BASE- FIFTY OF WHICH HAVE AC COMMERCIAL POWER TO THE REMAINDER OF THEM WE USE THE EXISTING COPPER NETWORK WE HAVE TO ONE POWER. SO THIS IS IN ORDER TO GET WITHIN FOUR THOUSAND FOOT LOPS OF COPPER TO GET BROADBAND OUT TO OUR CUSTOMERS THE DISTANCE BATES. I AM KIND OF PROGRESS. APPROACHING THIS FROM MORE BOOTS ON THE GROUND ABOUT. APPROACHES THAT ACTUALLY ACTUALLY GOING OUT ON SOME OF THESE CALLS MYSELF AND CAN WORKING THROUGH THESE THINGS. THE CALIFORNIA UNTIL THE EMERGENCY ASSOCIATION AFTER THE FIRST P. S. P. S. SENT OUT A QUESTIONNAIRE. AM I THOUGHT IT WOULD JUST BE THE BEST WAY TO CONNECTING CAPS LATE KIND WHAT WE EXPERIENCE JUST BY. KIND OF REVIEW THAT WITH YOU WHAT I WHAT I SENT BACK TO THEM. SO. I SHOULD START OUT BY INDICATING THAT AT LEAST FOR THE FOR THE AREA OF ALL CAN A TELEPHONE COMEY SERVICE THIS IS NOT THE FIRST EVENT LIKE THIS WE HAVE EXPERIENCE THROUGH THE YEARS WE HAVE HAD NUMEROUS SNOWSTORMS LIGHTNING STORMS THE BUTTE FIRE IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN ANOTHER EVENTS THAT HAVE COST P. GINNY SERVICE TO BE DISRUPTED FOR EXTENDED PERIODS OF TIME. OVER THE YEAR WE'VE DEVELOPED A BACKUP SYSTEMS AND THEIR PRACTICE FOR AN EVENT LIKE THIS. BUT FOR DIFFERENT REASONS. THE IRONIC THING ABOUT THIS EVENT WAS IT WAS PRETTY MUCH LAID OUT. AS TO WHAT WAS GOING TO FAIL MORE OR LESS WHEN AND WHERE. IF THE VANCE WE'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN HAVE AN UNPLANNED AND THE FAILURES ARE NOT KNOWN BEFORE THE BEGINNING OF THE EVENT. AND WE'RE THE FAILURES WORLD HER. TO I SHOULD PROBABLY HAVE THAT THIS WAS AFTER THE FIRST PSP US ABOUT THAT WE HAVE. WHAT IMPACTS DID THE PS PS INCIDENT HAVE ON YOUR TELLY. AS WE ARE BATTERIES AT ALL SITES AND GENERATORS AND ALMOST ALL OF OUR REMOTE SERVICES SITES FOR TELEPHONE SERVICE AS WELL AS INTERNET SERVICE DSL ADDRESS FIBER ONLY. WE WENT THROUGH MOST OF OUR OUTAGE WITHOUT ANY INCIDENTS. IN THE MOST CRITICAL PARTS OF OUR NETWORK AT THE PEAK OF THE PSP HOUSE. WE HAD FORTY SIX PLUS GENERATORS IN OPERATION. WHEN THE INCIDENT STARTED. THERE WERE FOUR SITES THE GENEROUS DID NOT START WE CORRECTED TO THE SITES BEFORE THE BATTERS RICH PLEADED SO. THOSE AREAS NEVER EXPERIENCED ANYTHING. ONE OF THOSE SITES WAS A LITTLE LARGER SO THAT WAS A GOOD THING. THERE WERE TWO SMALLER SITES THAT FAILED TO START AND THE BATTERIES WERE DEPLETED. AND WE HAD VERY VERY BRIEF OUTAGES ONE OF THE YEAR'S EXPERIENCE SEVENTY MINUTES OF DOWNTIME AFFECTED A PROXY ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY CUSTOMERS. THE OTHER SITE THAT FAILED EXPERIENCE ABOUT NINETY MINUTES DOWNTIME. BEFORE WAS CORRECTED IN THE AFFECTED ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE CUSTOMERS. AS WE STRADDLED THE PHASE ONE AND PHASE TWO LINES. FOR THE FIRST PSP ELSE. BEING BEING IN BOTH AMADOR CALAVERAS COUNTY WE HAVE A SMALL AMOUNT OF AREA. THAT HAD THE POWER TURNED OFF ON THE SECOND DAY. IT'S MOSTLY A LINE THAT FEEDS THE QUIRK WITH SKI RESORT DIRECTLY. THERE'S ONE VERY SMALL REMOTE SITE. IN THE BEAR RIVER AREA THAT FEEDS OFF OF THIS PLANET KERR QUIT. WE ALSO HAVE A GENERATOR FAILURE AT THAT SITE. THE BATTERIES DID ALSO GOOD DAD BEFORE ABLE TO RECTIFY THE SITUATION AS IT TURNS OUT THIS GENERATOR HAVE A MUCH MORE SERIOUS ISSUE. AND WE HAD TO PLAY TEMPORARY PORTABLE UNIT TO CORRECT. BY THE TIME WE HAVE SERVICE IN THE RESTORED ABOUT SIX HOURS AND EFFECTIVE NO MORE THAN FORTY ONE CUSTOMERS AS A MATTER OF FACT IT'S A VERY REMOTE- RESORT AREA AND- BY THAT TIME OF THE YEAR I'M NOT EVEN SURE ANYBODY WAS THERE. BUT WE STILL GOT RUNNING. THAT WAS THE EXTENT OF ORGANIZATIONS RESPECT OUR TELEPHONE INTERNET SERVICES. WE ALSO PROVIDE VIDEO CABLE TELEVISION OTHER INTERNET CABLE MODEM SERVICE AND A SELECT AREA BOTH COUNTIES THESE ARE ALL AREAS WHERE WE ARE NOT THE LACK. THIS IS A DIFFERENT NETWORK. AND THERE ARE ONLY BATTERIES AND NOT GENEROUS AND MOST OF THE SITES WE LOST MOST OF THESE AREAS WHEN THE BATTERIES DIED. THIS NETWORK IS LARGELY. NOT MISSION CRITICAL AND THAT'S WHY I SAY THAT IS WE ONLY DO VIDEO ACROSS THAT NETWORK EXCEPT FOR THE CHAIRMAN EMERITUS. ENHANCE HISTORICALLY HAD NOT BEEN BACKED UP THE SAME. AS A MORE CRITICAL PARTS OF OTHER NETWORKS IN ADDITION VOLCANO PROVIDES WIRELESS INTERNET SERVICE TO SOME OF THE MORE REMOTE OR HIS FAMILY- CALORIES COUNTY. ONCE AGAIN WE HAVE BANNERS TO VIRTUALLY ALL THE SITES BUT NO GENERATORS WITH THE EXCEPTION OF TWO CRITICAL BACK WHOLE SITES. WHERE WE DID DEPLOY PORTABLE GENERATORS. ANY SITES WITHOUT POWER QUIT AFTER THAT IS A COMPLETELY SWIRLS AREAS. SOME OF THE AREAS THAT WE SERVE WITH THE WIRELESS INTERNET WAS NOT AFFECTED BY THE PSP HOUSE. WHICH IS THE REASON THAT WE ONE HAND PULLING THE GENERATORS. DID YOU HAVE SUFFICIENT RESOURCES TO FORTY RESPONSIBILITIES AND MISSION IF NOT COULD YOU ACQUIRE THEM BY OTHER MEANS. WHILE WE HAD ENOUGH PROPANE. IS A RESOURCE THAT MIGHT HAVE BECOME AN ISSUE A CERTAIN POINT THE VENDOR WE USE IS VERY RESPONSIVE BUT THEY HAVE THEIR HANDS FULL TRYING TO KEEP PROPANE TANKS FILLED IN THE AREA AS MANY CUSTOMERS ARE AREAS HAVE HOME GENERATORS. HOW DID YOU SET PRIORITIES AND WHERE WERE THEY- I WHAT WERE THEY- FOR THIS INSTANCE. AS WITH MOST OF THEM WE HAVE EXPERIENCED OUR COMPANY LARGELY DISCONTINUES OUR CONSTRUCTION AND DAY TO DAY OPERATION AND GOES INTO NETWORK MAINTAIN VOTE. FOR EXAMPLE WITH NUMEROUS GENERATORS WE ALSO HAVE AN EVEN LARGER AMOUNT OF PROPANE TANKS AT THE SITES. MANY SITES HAVE TO LEARN FOR THE GALLON PROPANE TANKS. THAT ON AVERAGE ALLOW SITE TO RUN FROM THREE TO SEVEN DAYS IF THE TANKS ARE FULL MANY OTHER SITES ONLY HAVE FIFTY GALLON TANKS OR IN SOME CASES TO FOR THE CONTACTS. AND CAN ONLY RUN THE SITE FOR TWO DAYS OR LESS IT IS NECESSARY FIRST TO REFILL FIFTY GALLON TANKS. WHICH WE HAVE A PORTABLE FILLING STATION. OUR CONSTRUCTION HARD. AND THEN HALL TANKS THE VERY SITES IN EXCHANGE THE TANKS FOR THE EMPTY ONES. ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS OUR TO VEHICLE MECHANICS ARE PRETTY MUCH. CLEARLY CONSUMED KEEPING ALL THE GENERATORS RUNNING MAINTAINING THEM CHECKING THEM. HOW DID YOU TRIAGE ACTIVITIES AND HOW WERE THEY DRESSED IN THE PRIORITY. WITH THE EXCEPTION THE FIRST MORNING ACTIVITIES WE KEPT UP WITH HOLE OR NECESSARY TASKS LARGER IS MENTIONED IN THE FIRST QUESTION. IS POSSIBLY THE ONLY EXAMPLE OF TRIAGE AND PROBABLY MOSTLY WHY WE HAVE THE SEVENTY MIN AVERAGE AT THE SECOND SITE. AS WE WERE CORRECTING LARGER SITE FIRST. WHAT LESSONS WERE LEARNED IN ADDITION SHARE ANY OTHER THOUGHTS THAT YOU MAY HAVE THE MEMBERS UTILITIES TO BENEFIT FROM THIS EXPERIENCE. PROBABLY LESSON LEARNED FROM THIS OUTAGE IN KNOWING MORE THESE EVENTS ARE PROBABLY COMING. IS TO BEGIN TO IDENTIFY SOME OF THE LARGER IS THAT WE PROVIDE KILL MODEM INTERNET SERVICE AN ATTEMPT TO HAVE BACKUP POWER TO THOSE SITES. AS A START AND WE HAVE A RECORDING ORDER APPOINTMENT TO DO SUCH AS- IT WOULD REQUIRE MORE THAN SEVENTY ADDITIONAL GENERATORS TO COVER ALL OF OUR VIDEO AREAS THE FAILED DURING THIS PSP US. THIS IS JUST NOT PRACTICAL WAS CONSIDERING OUR SIZE. WITH THE ADDITIONAL MANPOWER THAT WOULD REQUIRE. ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF A LESSON LEARNED A LONG TIME BEFORE THIS EVER HAPPENS WITH OUR FIBER THE PRIM SERVICE IN MANY OF OUR READERS WE PROVIDE FIBER TO THE PLAN WE USE OUR EXISTING COPPER NETWORK TO POWER THE OPTICAL NETWORK TERMINAL THAT'S ON THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE. AND DO NOT RELY ON THE COMMERCIAL POWER OR BATTERIES. AS LONG AS WE KEEP OUR REMOTE SITES RUNNING WITH GENERATORS AND BATTERIES WILL CONTINUE TO PROVIDE TELEPHONE SERVICE. TO THE CUSTOMERS. LEGACY TELEPHONE SERVICE TO THE CUSTOMERS ARE. IN THE HOME AS WELL AS INTERNET SERVICE AGAIN AS LONG AS THE CUSTOMER HAS A GENERATOR IN YOUR HOME. VERSION AND I'M GONNA I'M GONNA CUT YOU OFF THERE OKAY I JUST WANTED ASK BABY THE PANEL A QUESTION REGARDING. THE WAY. RESPONSES ARE COORDINATED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE HAVE FIFTY COUNTIES. THEY RANGE FROM COUNTIES LIKE THE ONE YOU SERVE AN ALPINE WHICH HAS ABOUT A THOUSAND PEOPLE AND I'M TO. LA COUNTY WHICH HAS TEN MILLION. AND NOT EVERY COUNTY HAS A RESOURCES TO COME UP WITH EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS PLAN SO WHERE WE DO HAVE A COUNTY LIKE ALPINE. IS THERE ARE SPECIFIC. INFRASTRUCTURE IN THAT COUNTY TO HELP IN CASE OF EMERGENCIES OR IS THAT SOMETHING THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TAKES OVER WITHIN ITS RESOURCES. PROBABLY DEPENDS A LOT ON WORKS OUT- WE HAVE FIBER AND MUCH MUCH OF THE JANUARY UP IN THAT AREA BUT WE ONLY JUST VERY TOUCH A VERY SMALL PORTION OF ALPINE COUNTY. IN THE QUICKLY MASON WHETHER SKI RESORT US IS IN IN YOUR EXPERIENCE AS THE INDUSTRY IS THERE DO YOU COORDINATE WHAT THE COUNTIES TO COME UP WITH A RESPONSE PLAN IN CASE OF EMERGENCIES. ANY KIND OF EMERGENCY IS SOME AND WE KNOW THAT IN SOME PARTS OF THE STATE THEY HAVE REVERSED NINE ONE ONE AND THEY HAVE. DIFFERENT KIND OF COMMUNICATIONS OR TELECOMMUNICATIONS- PROGRAMS. TO ASSISTANT. BUT TO THE COUNTY SPECIFICALLY COME UP WITH A PLAN THAT YOU'RE INVOLVED IN THANK YOU TO HELP DESIGN THAT YOU PROVIDE INPUT INTO IN TERMS OF.WHAT YOU'RE YOU WHAT- SERVICES YOU CAN PROVIDE IN THE IN THE. IN THE CASE OF AN EMERGENCY- WHERE THE COUNTY HAS HIS RESPONSIBILITIES YOU HAVE THERE'S AN EXAMPLE IN SAINT EQUAL WE HAD WHAT DURING THESE OUTAGES INCENDIO COUNTY WE HAD A LOT OF ELDERLY- INDIVIDUALS WITH SOME OF THAT WERE HATS MOBILITY ISSUES THAT ONCE THEIR POWER WAS CUT OFF THEY COULDN'T. TRANSPORTERS SELVES TO. A HOSPITAL CLINIC OR TO AN AREA THAT HAD AIR CONDITIONING OR HAVE THAT OUR FOOD OR WATER. AND SO THERE THEY WERE CALLING MY OFFICE ASKING FOR TRANSPORTATION ASKING FOR SUPPORT THAT WAS NOT BE PROVIDED. IF THAT IS NOT INCLUDED IN TO DELIVER IT RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE COUNTY IS I MEAN WHAT WHAT CURRENTLY EXISTS AND INFRASTRUCTURE WITH REGARDS TO THE COUNTIES OR EVEN THE STATE IN RESPONDING IN THESE ELEMENTS YEAH I CAN SPEAK FOR EIGHTEEN T. SPECIFICALLY SO WE HAVE EXTERNAL AFFAIRS- RESOURCES TO ENGAGE WITH GOVERNMENT AT EVERY LEVEL RIGHT AT THE LOCAL. CITY LEVEL AT THE COUNTY LEVEL AT THE STATE WHAT LEVEL AS WELL A INCLUDING INTERFACING WITH- EMERGENCY RESPONDING OR FIRST IS ON THE ORGANIZATIONS AS WELL TOO SO WHAT WE DO IS BASED ON THOSE ENGAGEMENTS AND THE FEEDBACK THAT WE GET IN TERMS OF THOSE CRITICAL SITUATION THAT YOU DESCRIBED HEREIN- WHAT WHAT IT IS A CLEAR TO YOU WHAT RESOURCES ARE AVAILABLE BY EVERY GOVERNMENT. AGENCY IN TERMS OF WHAT THEY CAN TO PROVIDE SUPPORT TO THE PEOPLE IN THE STATE NOT TO ME SPECIFICALLY BUT- I RUN THE NETWORK AND I'M NOT NEXT DOOR FERTILIZATION BUT WHAT IS CLEAR TO ME THOUGH IS THAT WE DO GET CLEAR COMMUNICATION TO WHERE THE CRITICAL AREAS ARE AND WE PRIORITIZE OUR WE- INSURE. HELP PATIENT NETWORK STAYS UP TO SUPPORT THE CRITICAL IT IS A CLEAR TO ANYBODY AT THIS TABLE TERMS. OF WHAT'S AVAILABLE. AND SOME. A GOVERNMENT PLAN AMOUNTS. TO THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE IN CASE OF EMERGENCY I'VE NOTICED A CHAIRMAN THAT. DOES REQUIRE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO DEVELOP A LOCAL EMERGENCY SERVICES PLAN. THAT WE AND OTHERS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL HAVE IN. I'M NOT CERTAIN HOW FREQUENTLY THEY UPDATE THOSE PLANS- BUT THOSE PLAN SHOULD IN FACT INCLUDE IDENTIFICATION OF MANY THE TYPES OF THINGS THAT YOU'RE ASKING ABOUT. OKAY LET'S FOR HELP AND I CAN I CAN SAY IN OUR CASE WE HAVE SHARED THAT WITH THE VARIOUS COUNTIES THAT. WERE CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE ISAND- YOU KNOW KIND OF MADE THEM AWARE OF. WHERE THE KEY POINT I'M INTERESTED IN KNOWING LIKE IN A AND THAT MY COUNTY LIKE ALPINE WHAT RESOURCES ARE AVAILABLE FOR THAT. BUT WE COULD DEFINITELY LOOK INTO THAT CENTER SKINNER. THANK YOU BRADFORD AFTER. MY HOPE MY INITIAL COMMENTS ARE JUST ON A REFLECTION OF THE WHOLE PANEL SO FAR AND EVERYTHING THAT WE FACED AN INTERESTINGLY EVERYONE IS INDICATED THESE ARE ON THIS UNPRECEDENTED SITUATION AND I REFLECTED ON DURING THE BLACKOUTS OF ART IN OUR INCLUDE INCLUDE ELECTRICITY CRISIS IN THE EARLY TWO THOUSANDS TWO THOUSAND PROBABLY MANY MANY MORE CUSTOMERS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WERE AFFECTED BY BLACKOUTS THAN THESE POWER OUTAGES THE IT WAS UNPREDICTABLE. AND MAYBE NOT AS LONG OF DURATION FOR EXAMPLE IN THE CASE OF HOW LONG SAY MARIN COUNTY'S POWER CINEMA COUNTIES POWER WAS OUT DURING THIS LAST FIRE BUT- IT WAS CERTAINLY. CUSTOMERS ALL ACROSS THE STATE. AND UNPREDICTABLE AND SEMI CONSTANT SO THIS IS NOT UNPRECEDENTED. AND YET WHAT TO DO ONE BIG DIFFERENCE IS. FOR MORE DEPEND ON A LAND LINE STAND. I AM LESS DEPENDENT ON THE COMMUNICATION THING THAT REQUIRED A- POWER SOURCE NOW. IN THIS CONCEPT OF THAT. WOULD WOULD THE DIFFICULTY IS. THE LEGISLATURE DID NOT DIRECT. OUR TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANIES TO DEVELOP ALL OF THEIR TECHNOLOGIES. IN A POWER SOURCE. YOU ALL DID YOU CHOSE TO. AND SO NOW WE'RE IN A SITUATION AND EFFECTIVE BEING TOLD LIKE WILL DON'T REGULATE US DON'T REGULATE VOICEOVER PROTOCOL. BUT MAKE SURE THERE'S POWER SO ARE. OUR SERVICE THAT WE ARE PROVIDING TO RESIDENTS THAT WE'VE SOLD TO CONSUMERS AS SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO BE THERE THAT THE COMMUNICATION THAT THEY CAN RELY ON. THE SERVER THE EMAIL THOSE ARE KINDA UNTENABLE. AND I THINK WE HAVE TO PARTNER. AND WE HAVE TO LOOK AT HOW WE CAN ACHIEVE A COMMUNICATION SERVICE THAT IS LESS DEPENDENT ON POWER BECAUSE WE CANNOT ALWAYS GOING TO BE ABLE TO GUARANTEE IT WE'RE JUST NOT. AND FOR A WHOLE. REASONS LOOK AT AUSTRALIA. AND WE COULD FACE THAT OR AN EARTHQUAKE OF THE MAGNITUDE OF THE YOU KNOW EVERY EVERY PREDICTION THE VARIOUS FAULTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA CAN EASILY HAVE THE TYPE OF EARTHQUAKES THAT ARE FAR WORSE MAGNITUDE THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE SO WE NEED TO BE PARTNERS IN THIS AND THEY'RE PROBABLY WILL NEED TO BE ADDITIONAL REGULATION AS MUCH AS THE INDUSTRY DOES NOT LOVE IT SO. PARTNER WITH US TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO IT RIGHT BECAUSE ARE CONSUMERS BELIEVE THAT THEY HAVE. A COMMUNICATION SYSTEM THAT THEY CAN RELY ON. AND THEN ALL OF OUR EMERGENCY PROTOCOLS OR BASED ON IT NOW INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH. IN MY AREA WHERE THE EARTHQUAKE PREPAREDNESS PEOPLE COME TO YOU AND ORIENT YOU TO WHAT YOU SHOULD GET. THEY ADVOCATE FOR BATTERY OPERATED OR SOLAR CRANK OPERATED RADIOS. AND THEY TELL EVERYONE TO MAKE SURE THAT IN YOUR PUTTING TOGETHER YOUR EARTHQUAKE PREPAREDNESS THAT YOU MAY NOT RELY ON YOUR CELLULAR PHONE NOW THE PROBLEM IS THAT PEOPLE THAT IS NOT A UNIVERSAL UNDERSTOOD THING AND WE'VE NOT SET UP OUR EMERGENCY COMMUNICATIONS TO BE THROUGH THAT TYPE OF SYSTEM. BUT IF THAT'S THE TYPE OF SYSTEM WE NEED TO MOVE TOWARDS THEN AGAIN WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PARTNER TO DO THAT. BUT TO. TO KIND OF TURN TO US NOW AND SAY. THAT WE HAVE TO GUARANTEE THAT POWERS TWENTY FOUR SEVEN IN ORDER FOR YOUR SYSTEMS TO WORK JUST IS NOT GOING TO WORK TEN OF TEN OF. BRADFORD THANK YOU I'M GONNA HAVE GOAL A LOT OF WHAT CENTER SKINNER JUST STATED BUT I'M ALSO- EMBRACE WHAT. MS MCINTYRE STATED I THINK IT'S TRULY UNFAIR TO EXPECT. THESE ENTITIES TO PROVIDE BACKUP POWER TO ALL. THEIR RESOURCES AND ALL THE SERVICES THAT THEY PROVIDE- WE HEAR THE CHALLENGES OF GENERATORS AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE BUT MY QUESTION STILL SPEAKS TO I THINK WHAT THE REPRESENTED FROM THAT FOR A BLACK. BOOK RICK BUT QUENEAU ON WHY CONSIDER THAT FOR STATED AS IT RELATES TO THE DEPENDENCY ON. THE COPPER WIRE. AND THAT'S CRITICAL AND I WE HEAR EIGHTEEN TO USE IN THEIR SPENDING MILLIONS BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF- INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENT BUT WHAT PERCENTAGES THAT IT'S BEING. GOING TORTURE MAINTAIN THE COPPER WIRE BECAUSE REGARDLESS AGAIN WHETHER IT'S ON THE CELL PHONE WITH THERE'S A VOICE. INTERNET PROTOCOL YOU STEAL DEPEND ON THAT COPPER INFRASTRUCTURE AND AGAIN. EIGHT YEARS AGO NINE YEARS AGO YOUR OWN EMPLOYEES SAID YOU WERE NOT MAINTAINING THAT SO I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW FROM RISE IN AND EIGHTEEN T. WHAT COMMITMENT ARE YOU REALLY MAKING TO THE COUPLE. THANK YOU CENTER. THIS A COUPLE POINTS HERE OF FOR SOFT ADDRESSING CENTER SCANNERS- COMMENT ABOUT THE UNPRECEDENTED NATURE OF THIS- THESE EVENTS pOCCURRED IN OCTOBER AND ALSO PREVIOUS COMMENTS ABOUT HOW- HOW WHETHER OR NOT THE IN THE SHE WAS PREPARE FOR THE WORST. IN TERMS OF THE PS PS EVENTS ALITALIA FROM FROM MY EXPERIENCE- COUPLE ITEMS ARE IN THE INTERVENING IT'S OF THE ENERGY ISSUES IN THE PAST I'VE LIVED IN CALIFORNIA FROM WAS MY LIFE. I WAS HERE MANAGING SOME OF THOSE POWER OUTAGES ACKER ROLLING BLACKOUTS BROWNOUTS HAD OCCURS. DURING THE ENERGY CRISIS THE DIFFERENCE THERE WAS THAT THE RULING BROWN EYES WERE POWER IF YOU SHUT OFF FOR A FEW HOURS. THIS IS THE BALLOT BOB BARR. YEAH YEAH. PLEASE LET LET LET LET HIM BEEN TRUCK OUT OF SO WE IN TERMS OF THE- THE DEPLOYMENTS- WE WERE YOU KNOW WE HAD- GENERATOR IS DEPLOYED THAT WAS FIVE TO TEN TIMES MORE THAN WHAT OTHER P. S. P. S. EVENTS THAT HAS OCCURRED- AND WE ARE INVESTING IN TERMS OF GROWING THAT- GENERATING CAPACITY TO ADDRESS THAT RIGHT BUT THAT TO ADDRESS YOUR QUESTION SENATE REFEREE ABOUT- INVESTMENT IN TERMS OF- COPPER WIRES- WE ARE INVESTING IN FROM A COPPER WIRE PERFECT- PERSPECTIVE IN PROPORTION IT TOO WHAT OUR CUSTOMERS ARE REQUIRED RIGHT WOULD YOU SEE OF ABOUT TWELVE MILLION. CUSTOMERS ON THE COPPER WIRE WITH MILLION ON THE RIGHT NOW- I HAVE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE OVERALL NETWORK WE DON'T LOOK AT INVESTMENT IN TERMS OF A SINGLE TECHNOLOGY. WE LOOK AT- INVESTMENT FROM A NETWORK PERSPECTIVE IN TERMS OF THE OVERARCHING NETWORK TO ENSURE THAT WE GET THAT TYPE. GETS TO ADEQUATE AMOUNT OF INVESTMENT TO SHIP SUPPORT THAT AND GROW THAT CAPABILITY SO THAT THEY HAVE THESE ADDITIONAL- CAPABILITIES THAT WE WILL ALL TALK ABOUT IN TERMS OF HOUSE IS CENTRAL TO OUR AT THE ACTIVITIES. ARE YOU I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING BUT I TOTALLY DISAGREE I SOLD. TELECOMMUNICATIONS FOR IBM I. SO THE SYSTEM THAT INSIDE THIS BUILDING RIGHT HERE YOU STEAL DEPEND WHETHER USING A WIRELESS SYSTEM YOU STILL DEPEND ON THAT IT FOR STRUCTURE. THOSE INDEPENDENT PHONE COMPANIES DO SPEND ON THOSE AND DEPENDED- INFRASTRUCTURE THAT COPPER WIRE TO MEETING CUSTOMER RELIABILITY TO THEIR CUSTOMER.THAT DOES NEED TO BE MAINTAINED WITH YOUR CUSTOMER MIGRATES AWAY FROM ALL OUR LINE GOES TO WIRELESS THAT'S DEAL VITAL TO THE COMMUNICATION IN OVERALL SERVERS LIABILITY. EVEN. FOR YOUR CABLE NETWORK AT SOME POINT YOU'RE ON THAT BACK BALL. TACKLE IN TERMS OF FIBER OPTIC CABLE AND CALDWELL YOUR YOUR- YOUR COPPER CONNECTS DOES SOME YOUR FIBER- SOME OF IT YEAH I BUT I'M BE SANDWICH BECAUSE YOU'RE MY GREEN AWAY FROM BUT IT'S STILL A NEEDED INFRASTRUCTURE. FOR SERVICE RELIABILITY. THANK YOU CENTER MCGUIRE. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIR THEM. DC HAVE SOME QUICK COMMENTS ARE DISABLED FOR SOME RESPONSES AND ADD THEIR IS AT A COMMENT THAT WE NEED TO HOLD LIKE I'M PARAPHRASING ELECTRIC UTILITIES RESPONSIBLE AND ACCOUNTABLE. ABSOLUTELY I THINK THAT YOU'RE SEEN ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT IN THE STATE- TAKE ACTION TO BE ABLE TO HOLD IN PARTICULAR- UNBIASED HERE PACIFIC GAS ELECTRIC ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR ACTIONS IN THESE MASSIVE POWER OUTAGES AND I THINK THAT WE NEED TO BE PREPARED FOR THE WORST A MATTER IF YOU ARE- SL PROVIDER. PER CABLE PROVIDER WHETHER IT IS A POWER SHUT OFF. AN EARTHQUAKE A CYBER ATTACK- WE HAVE TO BE PREPARED WITH RESILIENT AND WE DONE SYSTEMS. SO FIRST OF ALL LET MEANS WE START TALKING ABOUT REAL NUMBERS I APPRECIATE ABOUT THE 7% OF RISING DISCUSS I THINK WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE REAL NUMBERS. ABOUT CALIFORNIANS. IN THE STAFF REPORT IS ONE POINT ONE APPROXIMATE MILLION CALIFORNIANS WE HEARD TODAY. FROM REPRESENTATIVES TWO MILLION CALIFORNIANS THAT WERE IMPACTED. FROM THEIR CELL CABLE OUR LAND LINES BEING DOWN. FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY FOUR THOUSAND ON CABLE LAND LINE ALONE AND THAT'S A MULTIPLYING FACTOR BY THREE. SO I THINK THAT'S THE REAL NUMBER WE NEED TO FOCUS IN ON IN HOW WE'RE GOING TO IMPROVE THAT. BACKUP POWER IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY NOW. AND JUST BEING CANDID MANY OF YOU WERE IN THE ROOM. I REPRESENT IS TOLD US. THAT YOU ALL WERE PREPARED FOR THE WORST. AND WE FAST FORWARD TO LATE SUMMER AND INTO THE FALL. AND THE WORST HAPPENED. AND WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN PREPARED FOR THAT. SO NOW WE'RE HERE. THREE THAT WE'RE NOT GONNA HIT A HUNDRED PERCENT. AGREE WITH THAT. BUT YOU NEED TO START WITH THE PLAN. SO WHAT I WOULD HOPE IS GOING TO COME FROM THIS HEARING VIEW FULL NUMBER ONE A PLANE'S GONNA BE PROVIDED BY BOTH TELECOMMUNICATION CABLE TO THE OFFICE EMERGENCY SERVICES ABOUT HOW YOU CAN MAKE A MORE RESILIENT SYSTEM. NUMBER TWO IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT COLLABORATION. IT'S A TWO WAY STREET. WE CAN'T HIDE BEHIND WERE FEDERALLY REGULATED UTILITY WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD AND SAY WE'RE GONNA BE COLLABORATIVE. WE'RE GONNA PROVIDE INFORMATION. AND WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT NOT JUST LARGE NUMBERS ABOUT HOW MUCH WE'RE INVESTING BUT SPECIFICALLY HOW WE'RE INVESTING IN. AND WHAT THE OUTCOME OF THAT INVESTMENTS CAN BE FOR RESILIENCY WITHIN THE SYSTEM. BECAUSE OTHERWISE WE WILL NOT HAVE THE METRICS TO BE ABLE TO DEFINE SUCCESS. THE LAST PIECES STREAMLINING ALL FOR STREAMLINING BUT HAS BEEN THE NAME OF PUBLIC SAFETY. IT CAN'T BE SMS SAID A NEW BUSINESS MODEL IN THE STATE. SO WHAT I WOULD HOPE IS THAT THERE ARE GONNA BE COMPROMISES WE MOVE FOR THIS YEAR OBVIOUSLY I HAVE A BIAS AS THE AREA THAT I PROBABLY REPRESENT WITH SENATOR DODD WAS IMPACTED DRAMATICALLY BY THE LOSS OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS CABLE LANDLINE CELL. CABLE MAINLINE. AND WHAT I WOULD HOPE. IS THAT THIS COLLABORATION WILL BE A TWO WAY STREET. WE WILL BE ABLE TO BE CONFIDENTIAL MOVING FORWARD ON CONCERNS. AS WE SIT AROUND THAT TABLE- AND THEN HOPEFULLY BE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD TOGETHER NINETEEN SURE THE CALIFORNIANS HAVE THE SYSTEM THAT THEY HAVE COME TO RELY ON. I AND THAT WOULD BE MY OWN COMES THINK THANK YOU SIR MCGUIRE A CENTER DOLLY. THE US CHAIR THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY TODAY SO. I'M MORE I'M MORE CONCERNED ABOUT. AND THE INFRASTRUCTURE ITSELF THAT AS YOU KNOW I STATED EARLIER WHEN THE PC WAS UP HERE ABOUT. WE HAVE A LOT OF I HAVE A LAND LINE IN MY HOME BECAUSE MY CELL SERVICE. THE SOCKS HOUSE OUT FOR NEW POLITICAL STATEMENT. IN A LOT OF MY CONSTITUENTS DO IN THE IN THE ROLE AREAS BUT WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE LIKE EIGHT MILLION PEOPLE THAT HAVE LAND LINES AND FORTY FOUR MILLION PEOPLE THAT USE. NEWS IS THIS FOR THEIR MAIN HOME USE AND IT'S ABOUT MAKING MONEY IN PROFITS AND THAT'S WHERE THE THAT'S WORSE DRIVING THE MOVE TO. YOU KNOW SELL SERVICES AND MOBILE DEVICES. IT IS ALSO WHAT THE PUBLIC WANTS. BUT THE SAME TIME WE STILL NEED TO HAVE THAT INFRASTRUCTURE SO YOU CENTER FOR CENTER BRADFORD PRODUCTS OF WHAT I'M I'M NOT EXPERT IN. WHAT THE INFRASTRUCTURE REALLY NEEDS BUT I KNOW ONE THING THAT IT DOESN'T WORK FOR. THE CONSTITUENTS I REPRESENT IS THAT. WHEN WE HAD A CAMPFIRE WE COULDN'T COMMUNICATE WITH PEOPLE TO GET THEM GOING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION BECAUSE THEY WERE GOING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION. TWICE VOTED FOR THE FEE ON THE NINE ONE ONE IS TO GET THAT IN PLACE. SO IS IT THE LAN IS IT THE COPPER LINES OR THE FIBER OPTIC LINES THAT THAT REALLY CARRY THE LOAD THEY DO. SOME POINT THIS HAS TO GO TO SOMETHING THAT TRANSMITS IT SOMEWHERE I'M ASSUMING. SO I WANT TO KNOW WHO'S RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT BACKBONE INFRASTRUCTURE. IS IT EIGHTEEN T. IS IT COMCAST WHO WHO ACTUALLY. IS RESPONSIBLE TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN IS IT YES. KITTERY ANSWER THAT QUESTION FOR ME. OR DO WE JUST SELL IT TO WHOEVER I WANNA BREAKS IT'S BROKEN AND NOBODY MAINTAINS IT BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY. I CAN'T GET. PROVIDERS TO COME TO MY COMMUNITIES. WHERE THEY CAN'T MAKE A PROFIT EVEN THOUGH WE ARE SUBSIDIZING THEM TO DO IT. IT IS ALL ABOUT PROFITS AT THE END OF THE DAY I NEED TO BE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE WITH MY CONSTITUENTS WHEN THERE'S A FIRE. OR THERE'S AN EARTHQUAKE OR THERE'S A MUD SLIDE OR WHATEVER IT IS. AND WE AND I AS I STATED EARLIER WE STEPPED UP TO THE PLATE WE PUT THE MONEY IN PLACE. FOUR EIGHT AB SIXTEEN SIXTY TWO I BELIEVE WAS THE NUMBER. I WORKED WITH THAT I WAS A CO AUTHOR JOINT AUTHORED WITH- MY FRIENDS FROM- THE- IMPERIAL THAT HAVE THE SAME ISSUES I HOP IN LASSEN. AND YOU KNOW WHAT THE MONEY IS THERE AND NOBODY'S ACCESS AND THAT MONEY BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT THERE'S OUR PROFIT IN EVEN THOUGH WE'RE SUBSIDIZING. SO I WANT SOMEBODY ANSWER WHO WHO'S MAINTAIN THAT BACKBONE INFRASTRUCTURE SO THAT WHEN THERE'S A FIRE I CAN ACTUALLY GET A LAND LINE OR WHATEVER IT IS OR GETS SELL SERVICES OUT THERE. SO WE CAN COMMUNICATE WHO DO WHO DOES THAT. UP TO ADDRESS YOUR QUESTION SO- IN TERMS OF WHAT TYPE OF FACILITIES FEED- CELL SITES- I COULD SPEAK SPECIFICALLY FROM EIGHTEEN T. PERSPECTIVE. I AM NOT AWARE OF A SINGLE CELL SITES BEING FED BY COPPER- ANYMORE ADDED TO MAYBE ONE DAY MAYBE TWO BUT- FROM MY KNOWLEDGE I'M NOT AWARE OF A SINGLE ONE. THAT STEP BY COOPER ALMOST THE VAST MAJORITY OF OUR CELL SIZE ARE FED BY FIBER OPTIC CABLES- BECAUSE OF THE HIGH CAPACITY DEMANDS THAT ARE CELL SITES NEED ANY CAPABILITIES. THAT'S REQUIRED TO SUPPORT THE SERVICES THAT WE ALL VALUE AS CONSUMERS- AND THE VAST MAJORITY OF THOSE FIBER OPTIC CABLES. A HEARING THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA RELATIVE TO EIGHTEEN T. IS MAINTAINED AND MANAGED BY OUR WATER LINE EIGHTEEN T. TEAM WHICH IS ALSO AND MY RESPONSIBILITY. CENTER HIS HIS FROM MINE FROM VERIZON AGAIN. FROM VERIZON PERSPECTIVE WHEN WE ARE DEPLOYING A WIRELESS FACILITY ANYWHERE- WE HAVE TO GET AT LEAST TWO OTHER THINGS OTHER THAN OUR WIRELESS FACILITY ITSELF WE NEED TO GET THE BACK HALL OR SOMETIMES CALLED FROM HALL WHICH WE DO WITH FIBER. WE DON'T DEPLOY THAT OURSELVES WE LEASED OUT FROM OTHER CARRIERS LIKE AT AND T. THE CABLE COMPANIES AND OR SOME OTHER CARRIERS OUT THERE THAT SPECIFICALLY PROVIDE FIBRE MICRON CASTLE- WE ALSO NEED TO GET POWER TO OUR FACILITIES SO WE HAVE TO GET THAT FROM A THIRD PARTY TO WE DON'T DO POWER. JUST AS WE DON'T DO POWER WE'RE NOT DOING THE FIBERS- WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT WHOSE RESPONSIBILITY IS IT- I THINK THE QUESTION SHOULD BE TALKED ABOUT MORE AS- AS HOW OR WIRELESS. NETWORKS BUILT. AND WHO HAS THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE DIFFERENT PIECE PARTS OF IT. ON AND HOW MUCH OF THAT DO WE WANT TO ENCOURAGE BECAUSE WE ACTUALLY WANT TO GET CELLULAR SERVICES TO SOME OF THE PLACES WHERE THERE IS NO CELL SERVICE RIGHT- SO I THINK THAT- I AGREE WITH EIGHTEEN TEASE COMMENT THAT. COPPER REALLY IS NOT PART OF THIS EQUATION ITS FIBER- AND YOU GET FIBER YOU PUT IT IN THE GROUND AND YOU PUT IT ON- UP ON. HOLES BUT- IT'S CRITICAL POWER AND FIBER TO GET CELL SERVICE. OKAY SO I'M GONNA CLOSE MY COMMENT WITH THIS STATEMENT. SO I UNDERSTAND COMPETITION I UNDERSTAND FREE MARKETS AND I THINK IT'S UPON THE LEGISLATURE AND- YES TO FIGURE OUT HOW WITH ALL THE COPPER- ALL THE FIBER TO SAY FOR AND THE AND THE POWER IN THE STRUCTURE IS BUT AS UPON US IN THE P. YOU SEE TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO MANAGE. OUR PUBLIC SAFETY PROBLEMS THAT WE'RE HAVING SO WHEN WE TRY TO TACKLE THAT WHAT WE HEARD FROM THE P. YOU SEE AS WELL THEY WON'T SHARE THEIR INFORMATION US BECAUSE IS PROPRIETARY FOR TO THEIR BUSINESS MODEL. WHAT I HEAR FROM YOU SAYING IS P. GENIES THE PROBLEM BECAUSE THEY SHUT THE POWER OFF. SO SOMEWHERE THERE HAS TO BE. A CENTRAL COMMAND SAYS OKAY WE'RE GOING TO FIX THE PROBLEM HERE BECAUSE WITH THIS IS NOT GONNA GO WE'RE GONNA HAVE FIRES IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE PLEDGE ARE GO. IF FOR THE SHORT TERM HOPEFULLY. THE MORE BUT POWER SAFETY SHUT OFF SITUATION SO WHO IS THAT- THAT'S ONE TO IS IT YEAH WE NEED ARE WE AS A LEGISLATIVE BODY GONNA SUPPORT TO ONE PERSON THIS IS A- YOU'RE GOING TO PUT THIS GREAT INTO PLACE AND YOU'RE GONNA MAKE ALL THESE PEOPLE PLAY THAT'S WHAT I'M HEARING THE LEGISLATORS SAY IS LEGISLATORS ASKED TODAY IS WHAT PIECE OF LEGISLATION DO WE NEED TO RUN. THIS THAT MAKES THAT COORDINATION HAPPEN BECAUSE WHAT'S HAPPENING IS WE'RE RUNNING A LITTLE PIECES ME CENTER REQUIRE MY SEAT MATE HAS BEEN FRUSTRATED BY THE FACT AND HE'S TRYING TO K<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; ÁI.&lt;/c&gt;</u> AND I AM HERE. SENATOR JACKSON I HEAR. BERKELEY FOLKS I HERE. YEAH I HOLDEN SAY SO. AND WHAT IT USUALLY HAPPENS IS WE DON'T GET IT RIGHT. BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ALL THE INFORMATION WE DON'T GIVE THE POWER TO THE RIGHT PERSON IS GOING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO IT SO I'M I'M HERE TO. SHARE WITH YOU. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET. WHAT YOU WANT AND NEITHER IS- YES AND NEITHER IS. THE P. YOU SEE INTEL WE FIGURE OUT WHAT THAT PIECE OF LEGISLATION SAYS AND GIVE SOME OF THE POWER TO SAY WE'RE GOING TO FIX THIS PROBLEM ONCE AND FOR ALL. THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE A SYSTEM SET UP WE HAVE THE BACK CALL ON THE FRONT HOLE. IN THE SIDE HOLE AND THE GENERATOR WERE SUPPOSED TO BE. SO THAT WHEN WE HAVE AN OUTAGE THAT WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE- AND CENTER DOLLY. I'M I'M JUST GONNA. WHAT I HEARD TODAY. AND WHEN WHAT WE WENT THROUGH TODAY IS THAT- YOU SEE. IS ASKING US ABOUT THAT THE INDUSTRY'S ASKING A SIT DOWN. WITH THE P. YOU SEE THROUGH AN INFORMAL PROCESS P. YOU SEE IS SAYING WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO EXPEDITE. OUR PROCESS WE'RE GOING TO. CREATE A SYSTEM IN WHICH WE'RE GOING TO. ADDRESS THESE ISSUES. AND I FROM IF I CAN ANSWER YOUR QUESTION I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE THE LEGISLATURE AND THE P. YOU SEE AND IN THE- INDUSTRY. WORKING AT TEN OO YES WORK IN IT TOGETHER TO IDENTIFY. THE MOST PRESSING CONCERNS AND COME UP WITH SOLUTIONS TO A MAN AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE- THAT'S WHAT THIS PROCESS IS ABOUT. AGAIN FIND THAT GOING DOWN THE STEPS IF WE NEED LEGISLATION. WORK ON IT WE'RE GONNA TRY TO SELL LEGISLATION WERE CARD PASS AT. TEN IF WE NEED THE P. YOU SEE TO ACT WE'RE GONNA COURAGE THEM TO ACT QUICKLY AND OF COURSE THE INDUSTRY IS MAKING PROMISES THAT THERE MEGA MAKE INVESTMENTS. INTO THEIR INTO UPGRADES. ARE WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON UNFORTUNATELY WE WILL START THIS CENTER STERN IF YOU CAN HAVE A- OF VERY BRIEF BECAUSE WE HAD WE STILL HAVE. WITH THEY'RE ASKING US TO LEAVE THE ROOM- BY ONE O'CLOCK SO WE'RE GONNA TRY TO- GET TO OUR NEXT PANEL WHICH IS. THIRTY MINUTES AND WE STILL. HAVE PUBLIC COMMENT WHICH WOULD BE LONG AS WELL SO. UNDERSTOOD AS CHAIRMAN I'LL TRY TO PUT IT PUT A FINE POINT ON- MY COLLEAGUES TO THE NORTH A CENTER DOLLY MCGUIRE- JUST TO GET A SENSE FOR THE PANEL HERE DO YOU ALL OF YOU THINK IT'S FEASIBLE TO PUT FORTH YOUR FIRST DRAFT OF A PLAN TO MAKE THESE AREAS RESILIENT LAYING OUT YOUR INVESTMENT TIMELINE YOUR PRIORITIZATION PLANS AND CAN YOU BRING SOMETHING LIKE THAT AFTER THIS HEARING PLEASED TO GET THE PROCESS STARTED LEGISLATURE. AND PUT THAT FORD AT JUST AT LEAST GET THE CONVERSATION ROLLING IS THAT SOUND LIKE SOMETHING IS FEASIBLE- AT LEAST THROUGH US WE KNOW THIS CAN BE PARALLEL PROCESSES BUT I JUST WANT TO GET A SENSE I KNOW THEY BOTH BROUGHT THAT UP BUT WHEN YOU GET SOME FEEDBACK FROM YOU ALL AND THAT'S ALL I HAVE MISTER CHAIR. I THINK IT'S FEASIBLE BUT I'D I'D LIKE IT TO BE NOT JUST OUR IDEA BUT OUR IDEA IN CONCERT WITH TALK AND- YES AND TALK INTO BECAUSE WE ALL KNEW EACH OTHER AND LET ME MAY THINK MAINTAIN MISS SOMETHING THAT- YES NEEDS AND SO I MEAN I REALLY THINK IT'S GOT TO BE A- YOU KNOW IT AND IT SOUNDS LIKE POLYANDROUS BUT IT HAS TO BE A COLLABORATION AND I WILL SAY. THIS IS NOT TO. BE CRITICAL. THIS EVENT AS AS- DIFFICULT AS IT HAS BEEN I THINK HAS PUSHED. ALL OF US. INTO A DIFFERENT PLACE I MEAN I'M HEARING OUT REACH FROM. FOLKS THAT I HADN'T HEARD OUT REACH BEFORE IN TERMS OF SITTING DOWN AND TALKING TO EACH OTHER SO WE'RE PREPARED TO CERTAINLY THE WIRELESS IS. PREPARED I THANK YOU VERY MUCH MEMBERS WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO THE NEXT PANEL ANSWER FROM THE OTHER. ANOTHER ONE BUT WILL ASK MR AMANDA. THE ANSWER'S YES YES. ABSOLUTELY WORKING THROUGH YES YES THINKING OF PERFECT OKAY- WE'RE GONNA NOW HERE FROM THE IMPACTS TO THE CONSUMERS FROM VARIOUS OF REPRESENTATIVES FROM OUT OF THE CONSUMERS IN OUR STATE BEGINNING WITH ANNA MARIA JOHNSON SHE IS THE- WITH THE PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S OFFICE. REPRESENTING A COMMUNICATIONS WATER. I'M SORRY SHE'S A BRENT THE BRANCH PROGRAM MANAGER OF COMMUNICATIONS AND WATER POLICY THAN WE HAVE REGION ACOSTA THE TO THE DIRECTOR OF TELECOM PAUL POLICY WITH THE UTILITY REFORM NETWORK. AND WE SET HAVE STEVE MOVE. MY CAR GAR THE OWNER OF THE FARM TABLE IN PLACERVILLE. WELCOME AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE. BEGIN WITH A MESS SANTA MARIA JOHNSON. PRESS BUTTON THERE THERE YOU GO. CHAIRMAN WESSEL AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME HERE TODAY TO TESTIFY IN THIS IMPORTANT HEARING. MY NAME IS ANNA MARIA JOHNSON PROGRAM MANION PROGRAM MANAGER AT THE PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S OFFICE THE PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S OFFICE IS AN INDEPENDENT ORGANIZATION IN THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITY COMMISSION THAT ADVOCATES ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS. FOR SAFE AND RELIABLE SERVICE OF ENERGY WATER AND COMMUNICATION I'M HERE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT COMMUNICATION. AS YOU HAVE HEARD THROUGHOUT THIS MORNING THE OCTOBER PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF. HIGHLIGHTED THE VULNERABILITY AND FAILURES OF THE COMMUNICATION NETWORK FOR BOTH WIRELESS AND WIRELINE SERVICE. IT'S SIMPLY A FACT WHEN POWER WENT DOWN A NUMBER OF CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SUCH AS CELL SITES THAT TRANSMIT WIRELESS PHONE AND DATA SIGNALS WENT DOWN. WIRELINE NETWORKS WENT DOWN THE ROUTE TRAFFIC TO AND FROM CELL SITES. AND AS MORE COMMUNICATION COMPANIES ARE ARE MOVING TO VOICE OVER INTERNET PROTOCOL WHICH IS VOIGTS. DOES SERVICES ALSO WENT DOWN CUSTOMERS WERE OUT OF TOUCH BUSINESSES WERE OUT OF TOUCH FIRST RESPONDERS RUN OUT OF TOUCH WHEN THE SERVICES DIDN'T WORK THIS IS A MATTER OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY. AND IT'S SOME IT'S CRITICAL THAT THESE SERVICES ARE WORKING SO THAT CONSUMERS CAN GET EMERGENCY EVACUATION ALERT. DIAL NINE ONE ONE. OBTAIN INFORMATION ON WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE COMMUNITY AND COMMUNICATE WITH THE LOVE ONCE. WE MUST BE CLEAR HERE. CONSUMERS ARE DOING THEIR DUE DILIGENCE THEY ARE CHARGING THEIR PHONES SOME HAVE ALREADY BACKUP POWER AT THEIR HOMES FOR MODEMS FOR THOSE THAT HAVE VOICE OVER INTERNET PROTOCOL. CONSUMERS ARE PAYING THEIR BILLS. CONSUMERS PAY SURCHARGES ON THOSE BILLS. THE BURDEN IS ON THE COMMUNICATION PROVIDERS AND THE ACCOUNTABILITY AND RESPONSIBILITY IS ON THEM TO ENSURE THAT THE NETWORK IS WORKING WE CAN NO LONGER PUT CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS TO BIRD AND TO DO THINGS THAT IT'S THE COMMUNICATIONS JOB AND RESPONSIBILITY TO DO WHICH IS TO MAINTAIN THE COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK. AS SUCH WIRELESS WIRELINE CABLE COMPANIES MUST BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE TO ENSURES CUSTOMERS CAN USE THEIR WIRELESS AND WIRELINE SERVICE DURING EMERGENCY AND POWER OUTAGES. AND THEY MUST SHARE DETAIL ADDED INFORMATION WITH FIRST RESPONDERS SUCH AS CAL FIRE AND CALLOW YES BECAUSE THIS IS CRITICAL INFORMATION FOR FIRST RESPONDERS TO LOCATE AND CONTACT WILL THE BOOKS CUSTOMERS. NOW I'VE BEEN SITTING HERE HEARING THE PANEL COMMUNICATIONS ARE COMPANIES AND I CANNOT HELP BUT HIGHLIGHT TO YOU THAT THIS IS NOT UNPRECEDENTED AND THIS IS NOT NEW. POWER OUTAGES HAVE OCCURRED. DECADES AGO. JUST RECENTLY IN THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN STORMS IN JANUARY AND FEBRUARY THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN REPORT I WILL RE FROM THE REPORT FROM THE COMMUNICATIONS SAYING THAT MANY OF THOSE OUTAGES FROM THE STORMS COULD HAVE BEEN PREVENTED WITH BETTER AVAILABILITY OF BACKUP POWER FOR WIRELESS PROVIDERS AND IMPROVE RELIABILITY OF CABLE FACILITIES FOR WIRELINE PROVIDERS. THE PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHOT US CANNOT BE USED AS AN EXCUSE TO HOLD COMMUNICATIONS PROVIDERS ACCOUNTABLE FOR MAINTAINING THEIR COMMUNICATIONS NETWORKS WORKING DURING A POWER OUTAGE. IT IS A MATTER OF PUBLIC SAFETY. YOU HAVE HAD OR HEARD YOU KNOW THAT MANY HEARINGS HAVE BEEN HELD FOR FIRST RESPONDERS CAL FIRE CALLOW YES HAVE STATED I EVEN AS EARLY AS- MAY OF LAST YEAR. THAT LACK OF BACKUP POWER IS ESSENTIAL FOR COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK IT WAS ALSO MENTIONED THAT THE PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S OFFICE FILE A MOTION FOR THE COMMISSION TO TAKE IMMEDIATE ACTION IN MAY TWENTY ONE OF TWENTY NINETEEN. AND ONE OF THOSE ITEMS WE ASK FOR IMMEDIATE ACTION TO REQUIRE BACKUP POWER A WIRELESS FACILITIES IN HIGH FIRE THREAT AREAS AND FLOODPLAINS. ACTION IS THE MEDIA N. AS DIRECTOR JOEL DO SHE- OF THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICE STATED TO YOU TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE THIS IS A DIRE SITUATIONS WE ARE WE ARE IN. AND CONSUMERS CANNOT BE CONTINUE TO BE PUT IN PUBLIC HARM. THEY ARE IN HARM RIGHT NOW BECAUSE THIS COMMUNICATIONS NETWORKS ARE NOT RELIABLE. AS SUCH ARE ASKED IT'S CLEAR. THERE ARE PROCEDURAL VEHICLES AVAILABLE RIGHT NOW IN THE COMMISSION TO TAKE IMMEDIATE ACTION TO REQUIRE WIRELESS CARRIERS TO TAKE ALL MEANS NECESSARY TO KEEP WIRELESS SERVICE WORKING DURING A POWER OUTAGE. INCLUDING HAVING BACKUP POWER. DOES BACK UP POWER REQUIREMENTS CAN USE EXISTING WIRELINE REQUIREMENTS WHICH REQUIRE SEVENTY TWO HOURS IN CENTRAL OFFICES THE ROUTE NINE ONE ONE CALLS TO NINE ONE ONE CENTERS. SECOND COMMUNICATIONS PROVIDER MUST IMMEDIATELY PROVIDE REAL TIME DETAIL ADDRESS INFORMATION TO FIRST RESPONDERS SUCH AS CAL FIRE AND CALORIE AS- AND LASTLY. THE COMMISSION WAS ACTIVELY MONITOR AND IN FOR COMPLIANCE WITH ANY ORDER LEGISLATIVE ORDER COMMISSION ORDER ANY ORDER MUST BE MONITOR AND ENFORCE TO ENSURE COMMUNICATION PROVIDERS ARE MEETING THOSE REQUIREMENTS. AS I STATED WE CAN NO LONGER SHIFT THE BURDEN TO CONSUMERS CONSUMERS PAY THEIR BILL AND THOSE BILLS ARE NOT CHEAP. THEY EXPECT SERVICE TO WORK AND SERVICE MUST WORK ESPECIALLY DOING EMERGENCY SITUATION. PUBLIC SAFETY POWERSHOT UPS PROVIDE A NOTICE TO COMMUNICATION PROVIDERS. BUT THE ISSUE IS POWER OUTAGES HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO BE THE ROOT CAUSE OF MANY OUTAGES IN ACTION MUST BE TAKEN NOW TO RESOLVE THE IMMEDIATE PROBLEM. THE PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S OFFICE AND MYSELF WILL CONTINUE TO PARTNER WITH THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION AND THE COMMUNICATIONS PROVIDER TO FIND SOLUTIONS BUT WE ARE VERY CLEAR THAT THOSE SOLUTIONS MUST BE IMMEDIATE. AS ONGOING CONVERSATIONS ARE HAPPENING ON WHAT ELSE NEEDS TO TAKE PLACE HAVING REQUIREMENTS OF BACKUP POWER WILL GO A LONG WAY OF ENSURING THAT COMMUNICATION SERVICE WORKS. AND WE CAN NO LONGER RELY ON VOLUNTARY PLANS OR JUST PLANTING GENERAL'S THAT THE COMPANIES ARE SAYING WILL CARRY OUT. ANYMORE SOME ALSO NOTE THAT IT'S VERY UNFORTUNATE THAT CONSUMERS WERE PUT AT RISK FOR COMPANIES SUCH AS EIGHTEEN T. TO TAKE ACTION TO INVEST MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND NOW SAY THEY WILL HAVE FIX. OUR BACKUP POWER IN HUNDREDS OF CELL SITES. THEY HAVE KNOWN THIS ISSUE FOR A VERY LONG TIME. AND THE FOCUS HERE IS IMMEDIATE ACTION AND ACCOUNTABILITY OF THE COMPANIES. THANK YOU AND I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR QUESTIONS THANK YOU MS JOHNSON. MISS COSTA. THANK YOU AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO APPEAR TODAY ON VIRGIN ACOSTA AND THE TELECOM POLICY DIRECTOR FOR TURN THE UTILITY REFORM NETWORK I WANT TO ADDRESS THREE GENERAL POINTS. INFORMATION FROM CUSTOMERS ABOUT TYPES OF OUTAGES. THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE DO NOT FLY UNDER THE RADAR SOME OF THESE RELATE TO POINTS THAT WERE. REST BY EARLIER SPEAKERS IN BY QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE POSED SECOND IS CONFIDENTIALITY OF INFORMATION REGARDING THESE OUTAGES AND THE THIRD AREA IS WHAT CAN STATE OFFICIALS DO. TO BEGIN. THERE ARE WIDESPREAD REPORTS OF WIRELESS AND VOIP OUTAGES BUT WHAT ELSE WAS MENTIONED EARLIER THERE WERE ALSO LANDLINE OUTAGES WE RECEIVED INFORMATION FROM CUSTOMERS INDICATING THAT SERVICE WAS LOST IN THE SANTA CRUZ MOUNTAINS DUE TO INADEQUATE BACKUP POWER FOR REMOTE TERMINALS REMOTE TERMINALS ARE BOXES THAT YOU WILL SEE THAT TAKE LONG TELECOMMUNICATIONS LINES ARE TYPICALLY LOCATED IN RURAL AREAS THEY COMBINE THAT TRAFFIC AND THEY SEND IT OFF TO THE TELEPHONE COMPANY SWITCH THEY RELY ON COMMERCIAL POWER IF THE POWER GOES OUT THERE NEEDS TO BE BACK UP. WE HAVE INFORMATION FROM A CUSTOMER THAT EIGHTEEN T. TERMINALS FILED. BASED ON PRESS REPORTS WE BELIEVE THE SAME THING OCCURRED IN MENDOCINO COUNTY AND FROM THE STATEMENT OF THE REPRESENTATIVE FROM MORAN EARLIER THIS MORNING IT IS A DISTINCT POSSIBILITY THAT SOME OF THESE LINES WERE SERVED BY A REMOTE TERMINALS- THE COMMISSION HAS THE AUTHORITY. TO REQUIRE THESE CARRIERS TO MAINTAIN THIS EQUIPMENT AND TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS ADEQUATE BACKUP POWER THIS IS PART AND PARCEL OF THE REGULATED COPPER NETWORK. AND WE BELIEVE THE COMMISSION SHOULD ACT PROMPTLY TO INST TO DO THIS TO ENFORCE IT TO MAKE SURE THAT. THERE IS AN HOUR AND WE ANTICIPATE THE NETWORK EXAMINATION TO SEE WHAT THEY HAVE TO SAY- THE SECOND THING IS THAT. WE DON'T HAVE THE DATA YOU DO. SO OUR QUESTION IS IF YOU IF YOU LOOK AT THE FCC REPORT IT'S JUST A GENERAL SUMMARY OF OKAY A HANDFUL LEASE LAND LINES ONE OUT HERE IN THE COMBINED EVERYTHING TOGETHER. WHAT WE'RE CURIOUS ABOUT IS WAS INFORMATION PROVIDED TO HELLO YES TO THE CPUC POSSIBLY TO YOU SAYING HERE'S WHAT ONE OUT IT WAS CAUSED BY THIS- THAT INFORMATION SHOULD NOT JUST BE SUBSUMED INTO THE GENERAL CATEGORY OF LANDLINE OUT IT IS IF YOU'RE GOING TO FIX PROBLEMS. YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENED. SO WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THE REPORTING OF THOSE ISSUES WE HAVE A REPORT FROM LAFAYETTE. ON ANOTHER ISSUE THAT WE DON'T SAKE HAS GOTTEN ANY ATTENTION. SHE IS A CUSTOMER OF A COMPETITOR. WHO LEASES FACILITIES FROM AT AND T. WHEN THE POWER WAS RESTORED HER SERVICE STILL DID NOT WORK SHE WAS TOLD BY. THE COMPANY THAT YOU GET SERVICE FROM WAS THAT AND I'M QUOTING FROM HER EMAIL TO ME- EIGHTEEN T. HAD A HUGE OUT ITS PROBLEM FOR HOME PHONE AND INTERNET SERVICE DUE TO PROBLEMS WITH THEIR BATTERY BACKUP SYSTEM. AND THEN THE CUSTOMER PROVIDED TO TURN- A NOTICE THAT WAS FROM THE CITY OF LAFAYETTE REFLECTING A CONVERSATION AT THE TT PROVIDED ON A LOCAL COMMUNITY WEBSITE AND HERE'S WHAT THEY SAID. IN CHECKING WITH MY NETWORK TEAM THEY INDICATED THAT ONCE PGA ANY POWER WAS RESTORED A PIECE OF EQUIPMENT IN A NUMBER OF OUR NEIGHBORHOOD CABINETS THAT PROVIDE INTERNET AND PHONE SERVICE WAS AFFECTED AND NEEDS TO BE REPLACED. THEY'RE HAVING TO LOCATE THE REPLACEMENT CARDS AND EXPECT TO HAVE SOME OF THEM REINSTALLED LATER TODAY AND THE SEATING. THE SHOULD BE VERIFIED. AND WE NEED TO KNOW IF THIS HAPPENED IN LAFAYETTE TODAY IN ANOTHER PLACE WHY DID IT HAPPEN- WHEN IT. WHAT THE SERVER REPORT TO AND ONE THAT THE SITUATION WAS. EXISTING AND IN REPORTS WAS INFORMATION PROVIDED ABOUT WHAT REALLY HAPPENED SO ONCE AGAIN. YOU THERE IT'S- YES THE CITY. YOU CAN GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS AND TRY TO FIX IT- SECOND THING IS FINALLY IS BACK CALL. THAT IS A HUGE THING AND WE'VE HEARD ABOUT THAT EARLIER TODAY I'LL JUST NOTE THAT DURING THE TECH FIRE ON OCTOBER TWENTY FIFTH DECEMBER MEDINA COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE SENT THIS TWEET. WIRELESS CALLERS WITHIN THE HIGH DESERT AREA MAY NOT BE ABLE TO CONNECT ON NINE ONE ONE LINES SO PHONE CALLERS ARE EXPERIENCING A FAST BUSY SIGNAL OR DEAD AIR AND THEN THE LINE DISCONNECTS CARRIERS AFFECTED EIGHTEEN TT. MOBILE SPRINT METROPCS AND VERIZON NO. TO REPAIR AT THE TIME. THAT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE A TRANSPORT PROBLEM. MAYBE THE TECH FLYER MAYBE A BACKHOE WE DON'T KNOW BUT MY QUESTION IS SOMEBODY WHO'S FOLLOWING THIS FOR CONSUMERS. IS WASN'T REPORTED. HASN'T BEEN VERIFIED AND HAVE THEY GOTTEN TO THE BOTTOM OF IT. OKAY SO MOVING TO CONFIDENTIALITY. WE WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT THE FCC IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS HAVE CONDUCTED IN DEPTH INVESTIGATIONS ABOUT MAJOR TELECOM OUTAGES AND ISSUE PUBLIC REPORTS THAT DESCRIBE IN DETAIL THE CIRCUMSTANCES IMPACTS AND EQUIPMENT FAILURES INVOLVED. TWO EXAMPLES ARE THE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE FAILURE OF VERIZON NINE ONE ONE FACILITIES THAT AFFECTED THREE POINT FIVE MILLION CUSTOMERS IN ARLINGTON VIRGINIA FOLLOWING THE DIRECTIONS STORM THIS WAS INVESTIGATED BOTH BY THE VIRGINIA STATE COMMISSION AND THE FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION. PUBLIC. THE NEXT THING IS WHAT CAN YOU DO NUMBER ONE DIVERSE ROUTING. THE POSTER CHILD FOR THE NEED FOR DIVERSE ROUTING I THINK IS MENDOCINO COUNTY BECAUSE WHEN THE FIBER WAS CAUGHT IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN ALL SERVICE ANY KIND OF SERVICE WAS OUT. TO WATCH WHAT THE COUNTY. THE REDWOOD FIRE BURNED A FIBER OPTIC CABLE ALL SERVICE NORTH OF THAT DAMAGED. PART WAS OUT AT LEAST- HUMBLED I'M NOT SURE ABOUT DEL NORD BUT DEFINITELY HUMBOLDT. I'M. BUT TO COMPANIES DIDN'T LOSE SERVICE ONE OF THEM WAS SUDDENLINK AND THE OTHER ONE WAS ONE OH ONE THAT LINK WHICH IS A LOCAL HUMBOLDT COUNTY COMPANY. WHY BECAUSE THEY LEAST CAPACITY FROM ANOTHER COMPANY. ON THE LINE OWN BY PGD RUN BY ANOTHER TELECOM COMPANY IT WAS IN EAST WEST ROUTE IT WASN'T DAMAGED SO IF YOU'RE SITTING AT HOME ALL COUNTY YOU COULD BE FOLLOWING WHAT WAS GOING ON DOWN SOUTH. THE OTHER THING IS THAT ONE OH ONE NETLINK HAD. FIBER WRAP OR OR- MICROWAVE ROUTE MIKE WITH CLUBS RUNNING UP ONE ONE. THEY WILL NOT DAMAGED IN THE FIRE BUT THEY SAID THEY TOLD THE HUMBOLDT COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS THAT IF THEY HAD BEEN DAMAGE THEY STILL WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PROVIDE SERVICE BECAUSE THEY HAD THAT EXTRA CAPACITY AT LEAST ON A SEPARATE LINE THAT WAS NOT AFFECTED. ROUTE DIVERSITY IS PART AND PARCEL OF A RELIABLE RESILIENT NETWORK PEOPLE AT LOCAL OFFICIALS HAVE BEEN CALLING FOR THIS FOR A LONG TIME WE BELIEVE THE COMMISSION HAS THE AUTHORITY TO ORDER THESE COMPANIES. TO UTILIZE SUFFICIENT DIVERSE ROUTING IT CAN SIGNIFICANTLY MITIGATE OUTAGES OKAY. LASTING WHAT YOU CAN DO A MINUTE OKAY ONE MINUTE. S. DIVERSE ROUTING ADDRESS BACKUP POWER UNDER MARIA DRESS THAT WHAT SEVEN TEN THE WHOLE IT'S SUNSET LET IT STAY THAT WAY WHAT THE D. COMPANIES CAN'T THROW THAT IN THE FACE OF THE COMMISSION WHEN THEY'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS ISSUES. FIVE THEY SAY WE'RE DOING THIS MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE DOING IT IF THEY SAY WE'RE INVESTING MAKE SURE THEY'RE INVESTING AND LET THE COMMISSION HAVE THE EXPERTISE NECESSARY TO DO. THE FOLLOW AT G. GO AND LOOK AT WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND VERIFY. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISS COSTA MISTER MCCARTY. THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME SPEAK TODAY. MY NAME IS STEVE MCCARTY- ON THE OWNER OF THE RESTAURANT UP AND PLACERVILLE CALL PERFORM TABLE AND I WAS ASKED TO SPEAK TO DATE- AND NOT ABOUT. YOU KNOW WHAT THE PROBLEMS ARE WHAT THE PROBLEMS OF COME TO BE BUT BUT MORE ABOUT THE IMPACT OF THE LACK TELECOMMUNICATIONS HAS ON A OF LOCAL BUSINESS AND AMONG THE OTHER BUSINESSES THAT THAT I WORK AROUND IN THAT. PARTICULAR AREA. REALLY WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS JUST TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE ECONOMIC IMPACT IS HUGE- WHEN YOU LOOK AT A COMPANY LIKE MINE. IS A RELATIVELY SMALL RESTAURANT- BUT WE HAVE- TWENTY EMPLOYEES AND THAT. WITH OR WITHOUT TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES WITHOUT WHEN THE POWER WENT OUT- IT OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE THE GENERAL ISSUES OF REFRIGERATION ELECTRICITY POWER THINGS LIKE THAT. WE WERE FORTUNATE IN THAT THE CITY HAD ARRANGED FOR AFTER THE FIRST- POWER OUTAGE- TO HAVE A GENERATOR. THAT PROVIDED SOME POWER TO THE LOCAL DOWNTOWN DISTRICT BUSINESSES. AND I WAS FORTUNATE TO BE ON HAPPEN TO BE ON ONE SIDE OF THE STREET THAT ALLOW THAT POWER. BUT WHAT REALLY IMPACTED US WAS THE LACK OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS- WE HAD A LOT OF CUSTOMERS CALLING TRYING TO FIND OUT ARE WE OPEN. WE HAD NO IDEA THEY WERE CALLING BECAUSE OUR FOR OUR PHONES WERE OUT. MORE IMPORTANTLY WHEN WE TAKE BUSINESS MOST BUSINESSES THAT I'VE TALKED TO IN THE STREET HAVE THE CAPABILITY OF STORING CREDIT CARD DATA IN THERE- POINT OF SALE SYSTEMS. BUT. YOU CAN'T YOU CAN'T GET PAID UNLESS YOU CAN TRANSMIT THAT DATA. TO THE MERCHANT- PROCESSORS AND SO YOU END UP HAVING FOR FIVE DAYS WORTH OF CREDIT CARD TRANSACTIONS SITTING IN YOUR REGISTER- UNABLE TO GET PAID. OBVIOUSLY THE- BILLS DON'T STOP AND WHEN YOU HAVE THAT CAPABILITY OF NOT HAVING THAT INCOME IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S A HUGE STRAIN ON ON MY BUSINESS SOME OF THE OTHER BUSINESSES THAT ARE IN THAT PARTICULAR AREA- SO IT WAS IT SOMETHING THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT. WE'D HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO AND HAND HOW TO DO IT- IT'S JUST SOMETHING I WANNA MAKE SURE YOU GUYS ARE AWARE OF THAT THERE IS. AND I'M SURE YOU ARE THAT THERE IS A HUGE ECONOMIC IMPACT AND THESE ARE THE KIND OF THINGS THAT HAPPEN FOR FROM A BUSINESS STANDPOINT THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE.ALSO THE FACT THAT SOME EMPLOYEES HAVE. NO IN ABILITY THEY DON'T HAVE A CELL PHONE MAYBE- THEY CAN'T COMMUNICATE WITH THE RESTAURANT THEY DON'T KNOW IF WE'RE GONNA BE OPEN THEY DON'T KNOW WHETHER TO REPORT TO WORK- IF THEY REPORT TO WORK AND THEN- I MAY HAVE TO PAY THEM THE- TO BASICALLY DO NOTHING- IF I'M OPEN- CUSTOMERS ARE COMING AND THEY DON'T KNOW WE'RE OPEN. SO MY BUSINESS CLOSED DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY- BECAUSE OF THAT. SO ALL THESE THINGS ARE ARE REALLY IMPORTANT THINGS TO KNOW AND I CAN APPRECIATE THE HEADACHE THAT IT IS TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO. GET A RUN AROUND ALL THESE PROBLEMS BUT- I ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S- IN EVERYBODY'S FOR FRONT THAT THAT THEY UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS A HUGE ECONOMIC IMPACT ON BUSINESSES AND- HILL AND NEVER WANT TO DOWNPLAY THE SAFETY AND THE EMERGENCY MEDICAL AND HAND JUST BASIC COMMUNICATION NEEDS BUT- OTHERS ALSO THAT ADDITIONAL COST AND THE COST FOR TO US. IS FAR GREATER THAN JUST THE LOS. BIZ FOR THE DAY OR WEEK OR WHATEVER. BOB. IS SOMETHING THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY IS AWARE OF. I THINK THAT'S IT. YOU'RE ALL COMING IN HANGING IN FOR THE LAST PANEL REALLY APPRECIATED. ANY QUESTIONS FROM MY COLLEAGUE THAT NO I JUST WANT TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY NO QUESTIONS BUT TO EVERYONE THAT THAT'S BEEN HERE THIS ENTIRE TIME AND OTHER PREVIOUS PANELISTS AND YOURSELF THANK YOU FOR COMING AND GOING AS REALLY APPRECIATED THANK YOU SENATOR RUBIO- THAT CONCLUDES THIS PANEL WE KNOW WILL. ACCEPT PUBLIC COMMENTS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AGAIN. AFTER MAN MISTER TERRY BRIEFLY IGNACE YOUR HERNANDEZ A BEHALF THE COMMUNICATION WORKERS OF AMERICA DISTRICT NINE CALIFORNIA HAWAII NEVADA WITH OF COURSE THOUSANDS OF WORKERS HERE IN CALIFORNIA- PARTICULAR WITH EIGHTEEN TEAM AND OTHER COMPANIES. WE'RE HERE I WANT TO FIRST OF ALL THANK- ALL OF THE MEMBERS WERE HERE THROUGHOUT THE TESTIMONY- WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE FRANKNESS OF FOR A LOT OF THE DISCUSSION TODAY. AND THE WILLINGNESS TO- IT APPEARS ON BEHALF OF THE LEGISLATORS TO DO SOMETHING GOING FOR TO DO MORE WORK GOING FORWARD- AS ONE OF THE- WITNESSES. TESTIFIED THIS SOME OF THESE ISSUES ARE NOT NOW SOME OF THESE ISSUES WE HAVE BEEN FIGHTING AND DISCUSSING FOR NUMBER OF YEARS- SO WE DO LOOK FORWARD TO A VERY ROBUST AND AGGRESSIVE. APPROACH TO THESE ISSUES- CW A DOES LOOK FORWARD TO BEING AT THE TABLE BOTH IN THE FORMAL AND INFORMAL DISCUSSIONS. OR WORKERS ARE OFTEN THE ONES THAT HAVE THE DIRECT CONTACT WITH THE CUSTOMERS THE CONSUMERS AND WE FIND OUT WHAT'S GOING ON ON THE GROUND WE CAN PROVIDE THE REAL STORIES. WE CAN HEAR THAT IF YOU'RE HEARING ONE THING THAT THIS IS WHAT THE POLICY IS BUT WE'RE HEARING ON THE GROUND SOMETHING ELSE IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING OR NOT HAPPENING. WE HAVE ABOUT THE STORIES WE WILL CONTINUE TO PROVIDE THOSE STORIES. ONE FOUR WE LOOK FOR. LOOK FORWARD TO BEING PART OF ALL OF THOSE DISCUSS. THE LAST THING JUST WANT TO MENTION IS HIGHLIGHTED EARLIER THE SUNSET AT SEVEN TEN. SHOOT ME SECTION SEVEN TEN ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL IT REALLY OPENS UP THE WORLD TO DO A LOT MORE AND FOR THE COMMISSION TO DO A LOT MORE. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO BEING PART OF THAT WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE CREST OF ACTION AND SWIFT ACTION- BUT THAT SUNSET NEEDS TO REMAIN OTHERWISE IT'S GOING TO REALLY REALLY HOLD BACK. ANY EFFORTS- THAT WE HAVE GOING FORWARD SO WITH THAT WANT TO THANK YOU AGAIN SEE W. A. IS POISED TO BE THERE TO WORK EVERY STEP OF THE WAY TO REALLY. FIND SOME REAL SOLUTIONS FOR CALIFORNIA THANK YOU. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON TRACY WRI WROTE COUNTY REPRESENTS OF CALIFORNIA I WILL BE VERY BRIEF- WE REPRESENT THE THIRTY SEVEN COUNTIES- THAT HISTORICALLY ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY. AFFECTED BY THESE TYPES OF OUTAGES AND THAT WAS EVEN BEFORE PS PS EVENTS- IN FACT. LAST YEAR IN FEBRUARY- BEAR VALLEY AREA WAS OUT OF PHONE AND INTERNET SERVICE FOR FIVE WEEKS. AND THAT WAS NOT A P. S. P. S. ABOUT- THESE AREAS ALSO ARE AREAS THAT SEE MORE DISASTERS AND HAVE MORE OF A NEED FOR A RELIABLE TELECOMMUNICATION. AND SO WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO HAVE THIS DISCUSSION- WE THINK THAT- THE P. YOU SEE IN THE N. O. YES IS IN A GOOD PLACE TO ASK FOR THE DATE I THINK WE NEED TO START WITH THE DATA. BEFORE CRAFT THE SOLUTION IT WE ARE SPUR OF THOSE EFFORTS AND ALSO THE DISCUSSION ABOUT BATTERY BACKUP THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE WISHING TO SPEAK UNDER PUBLIC COMMENTS. THAT CONCLUDES OUR COMMITTEE MEETING THANK YOU FOR ATTENDING AND. SURE IT AT THE CHURCH WHERE HER YOU HAVE SOME SAGE REMARKS BUT I DO NOT SO THANK YOU FOR COMING
