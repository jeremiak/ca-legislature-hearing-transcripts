SO. IT IS YOU KNOW PART OF THE-

00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:04.469

THAT EVERYONE HAS SOME

00:30:19.017 --> 00:30:20.518

SPECIALIST IN ANYWAYS- WE JUST

00:30:27.091 --> 00:30:29.260
WANT SOME UNDERSTANDING AND

00:30:29.327 --> 00:30:30.895
THIS COMES ALSO FROM SURVEYS

00:30:30.962 --> 00:30:32.497
FROM THE DECISIONS THEMSELVES

00:30:32.564 --> 00:30:33.464
SAYING THAT THEY DON'T HAVE

00:30:33.531 --> 00:30:35.066
ENOUGH TRAINING OR INFORMATION.

00:30:35.133 --> 00:30:36.768

SOMETHING AND SO WE'RE TRYING

00:30:42.273 --> 00:30:43.608
TO IDENTIFY WHAT IT WOULD LOOK

00:30:43.675 --> 00:30:45.610
LIKE- AS YOU KNOW THIS BILL WAS

00:30:45.677 --> 00:30:46.444

SHE'S AT THE END BECAUSE THE

00:31:03.728 --> 00:31:05.730
OUTCOME IS FOR MORE PEOPLE TO

I KNOW IT'S IMPORTANT- AND WITH

00:31:15.974 --> 00:31:17.508
I WOULD MOVE THE BILL. THANK

YOU. BUT PAN. THANK YOU- FAIR

00:31:24.182 --> 00:31:26.184
AND- FIRST OF ALL I DO

00:31:26.251 --> 00:31:28.987
APPRECIATE- THE AUTHORS GOALS

00:31:29.053 --> 00:31:30.288
AND THE SPONSORS SCHOOL OF-

00:31:30.355 --> 00:31:32.323
TRYING TO IMPROVE- SCREENING

00:31:32.390 --> 00:31:36.361
AND- AND MANAGEMENT OF- PEOPLE

00:31:36.427 --> 00:31:40.398
WITH DEMENTIA- AND HOWEVER I DO

00:31:40.465 --> 00:31:43.568
HAVE CONCERNS THAT THE APPROACH

00:31:43.635 --> 00:31:45.203
WHICH IS TO MANDATE CONTINUE

00:31:45.270 --> 00:31:46.804
EDUCATION IS NOT THE

00:31:46.871 --> 00:31:48.806
APPROPRIATE ONE OR DEFECTIVE

00:31:48.873 --> 00:31:51.009
WAY OF GOING ABOUT DOING THIS

00:31:51.075 --> 00:31:52.877
FACT IN THE PAST THIS COMMITTEE

00:31:52.944 --> 00:31:56.281
HAS- GENERALLY- DISCOURAGED-

00:31:56.347 --> 00:31:57.782
MANDATING CONCERNING EDUCATION

00:31:57.849 --> 00:31:58.983
BECAUSE OUT AS A MEDICAL

00:31:59.050 --> 00:32:00.485
EDUCATOR I TELL YOU THAT ADULT

00:32:00.551 --> 00:32:02.887
LEARNING PRINCIPLES BECAUSE WE

00:32:02.954 --> 00:32:03.488
WANT TO PLAY EVIDENCE TO OUR

00:32:03.554 --> 00:32:05.690
POLICIES. FIGLEY SAY THAT FOR

00:32:05.757 --> 00:32:07.792
ADULTS THAT SELF DIRECTED

00:32:07.859 --> 00:32:09.193
LEARNING IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE

00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:12.096
WAY TO FOR PEOPLE TO LEARN SO

00:32:12.163 --> 00:32:13.197
MAKING SOMEONE SIT THROUGH A

00:32:13.264 --> 00:32:15.967
CLASS THAT THEY THEMSELVES- DID

00:32:16.034 --> 00:32:18.870
NOT CHOOSE BUT ARE REQUIRED TO

00:32:18.936 --> 00:32:20.104
IS NOT A VERY EFFECTIVE WAY OF

00:32:20.171 --> 00:32:22.640
TRYING TO- TO IMPROVE THEIR

00:32:22.707 --> 00:32:24.375
THEIR SKILLS SAID IN FACT I

00:32:24.442 --> 00:32:25.677
THINK THE I APPRECIATE THE

00:32:25.743 --> 00:32:28.012
TESTIMONY FROM SUPPORTERS BUT

00:32:28.079 --> 00:32:28.613
I'M NOT SURE THIS IS THE RIGHT

00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:32.350
SOLUTION. HOWEVER I WOULD SAY

00:32:32.417 --> 00:32:35.119
THAT- THAT THE ANSWERS ARE THE

00:32:35.186 --> 00:32:36.954
DRAWCONTRAST ACTUALLY IS FOR

00:32:37.021 --> 00:32:39.223
EXAMPLE- WE'RE TRYING TO

00:32:39.290 --> 00:32:40.558
IMPROVE- BECAUSE PETERSON WE'RE

00:32:40.625 --> 00:32:41.793
TRYING TO PROVE SCREENING FOR

00:32:41.859 --> 00:32:44.796
ADVERSE HEALTH EVENTS- SO WHAT

00:32:44.862 --> 00:32:46.397
WE HAVEN'T DONE IS MANDATE THAT

00:32:46.464 --> 00:32:47.632
PEDIATRICIANS AND OTHER

00:32:47.699 --> 00:32:49.033
PHYSICIANS TAKE YOUR CHILDREN

00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:50.968
ARE MANDATED TO SIT THROUGH S.

00:32:51.035 --> 00:32:52.970
C. C. COURSE ABOUT ADVERSE

00:32:53.037 --> 00:32:54.539
CHILDHOOD EVENTS BECAUSE SOME

00:32:54.605 --> 00:32:58.109
ACTUALLY ARE FAIRLY FAMILIAR

00:32:58.176 --> 00:32:59.477
JUDGE THEREFORE CHOOSE HOWEVER

00:32:59.544 --> 00:33:01.446
WHAT WE HAVE DONE IS WE'VE

00:33:01.512 --> 00:33:03.381
ESTABLISHED OUTCOME MEASURES-

00:33:03.448 --> 00:33:04.982
THROUGH OUR MEDICAL PROGRAM

00:33:05.049 --> 00:33:07.085
WE'VE- ALSO. SET QUALITY

00:33:07.151 --> 00:33:08.619
STANDARDS AROUND THAT AND I

00:33:08.686 --> 00:33:10.321
HOPE THAT THAT'S THE APPROACH

00:33:10.388 --> 00:33:13.024
THAT THE- THE PROPONENTS MIGHT

00:33:13.091 --> 00:33:13.858
WANT TO CONSIDER AS AN

00:33:13.925 --> 00:33:15.493
ALTERNATIVE SIDE THAT BECAUSE

00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:16.694
IT'S REALLY THE OUTCOME THAT

00:33:16.761 --> 00:33:17.929
MATTERS IT'S NOT THAT SOMEONE

00:33:17.995 --> 00:33:19.263
DID SOMEONE TO OF COURSE AND

00:33:19.330 --> 00:33:23.901
TAKE. THAT OFF THEY SAT THROUGH

00:33:23.968 --> 00:33:25.336
A COURSE INHOPEFULLY. AND

00:33:25.403 --> 00:33:26.571
FORTY THIS IS ALSO A HAVING SAN.

00:33:26.637 --> 00:33:28.206
THIS AND WE CAN ABOUT WIFE OUR

00:33:28.272 --> 00:33:31.442
VERSUS HOURS OR SIX HOURS- AND

00:33:31.509 --> 00:33:32.744
IT'S EVERY TWO YEARS. THAT

00:33:32.810 --> 00:33:33.544
SOMEONE DOES IT JUST TAKE THE

00:33:33.611 --> 00:33:35.313
SAME COURSE EVERY TWO YEARS IN

00:33:35.380 --> 00:33:36.581
ORDER TO CHECK OFF THE

00:33:36.647 --> 00:33:38.015
REQUIREMENTS OF WE'RE NOT

00:33:38.082 --> 00:33:40.151
EXACTLY- THREE OR KNOWLEDGE OR

00:33:40.218 --> 00:33:41.386
ACTUALLY TAKING AWAY THEIR

00:33:41.452 --> 00:33:42.453
OPPORTUNITY TO THAN TO TAKE

00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:43.654
COURSES AND OTHER THINGS THAT

00:33:43.721 --> 00:33:46.657
THEY HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT. SO I

00:33:46.724 --> 00:33:50.094
APPRECIATE- THE AUTHORS- GOALS

00:33:50.161 --> 00:33:52.063
I WOULD CERTAINLY LOOK FORWARD

00:33:52.130 --> 00:33:55.233
TO THE OPPORTUNITY TO- TO- TO

00:33:55.299 --> 00:33:57.301
WORK WITH YOU A CERTAIN AMOUNT

00:33:57.368 --> 00:33:59.570
ON THIS BUT FORTUNATE. CANNOT

00:33:59.637 --> 00:34:00.905
SUPPORT THE BILL AS IT IS AT

00:34:00.972 --> 00:34:02.073
THIS TIME BUT I APPRECIATE YOU

00:34:02.140 --> 00:34:03.875
HAVING THESE CONVERSATIONS AND

00:34:03.941 --> 00:34:05.510
I HOPE THAT- THOSE

00:34:05.576 --> 00:34:07.378
CONVERSATIONS ARE. BECOME

00:34:07.445 --> 00:34:09.547
FRUITFUL AND THAT WE CAN.

00:34:09.614 --> 00:34:10.815
REALLY LOOK AT A BILL THAT

00:34:10.882 --> 00:34:12.683

GRANDMOTHER IN THIS CASE WHO I

HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO LIVE

00:38:40.751 --> 00:38:43.954
WITHIN MEXICO- WAS DIAGNOSED

00:38:44.021 --> 00:38:45.523
BEFORE SHE WAS DIAGNOSED AND

00:38:45.589 --> 00:38:46.691
THERE WAS A LOT OF HARM THAT

00:38:46.757 --> 00:38:48.526
HAPPENED IN THE PROCESS OF. NOT

00:38:48.592 --> 00:38:50.061
BEING DIAGNOSED BECAUSE WE DID

00:38:50.127 --> 00:38:51.295
NOT FIRST OF ALL WE'RE NOT VERY

00:38:51.362 --> 00:38:53.831

DEMENTIA AND- AND IT CREATED A

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:57.635
LOT HAVE ACT. IN IN IN THE

00:39:00.304 --> 00:39:01.472
BILL'S I DO UNDERSTAND THE

00:39:01.539 --> 00:39:03.340
CONCERNS OF DOCTOR PAN HOUSE.

00:39:03.407 --> 00:39:04.875
BUT I'M GRATEFUL FOR THE

00:39:04.942 --> 00:39:07.411
OPPORTUNITY THAT THE- AUTHOR-

00:39:07.478 --> 00:39:09.814
HAS IN REGARDS TO AMENDING IT

00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:13.084
SO THAT IT DOES. ACCOMMODATE

00:39:13.150 --> 00:39:14.785
SOME OF THE CONCERNS BUT I DO

00:39:14.852 --> 00:39:16.220
BELIEVE THAT WE DO NEED MORE

00:39:16.287 --> 00:39:18.089
AWARENESS IN THE MEDICAL.

00:39:18.155 --> 00:39:19.457

ALZHEIMER'S DEMENTIA SO I THINK

00:39:28.632 --> 00:39:29.567
THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE

00:39:29.633 --> 00:39:31.135

I JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE THE

00:40:04.401 --> 00:40:05.970
POINT THAT THIS IS A GROWING

00:40:06.036 --> 00:40:08.172

01:11:43.966 --> 01:11:45.034
FOR BILL WERE FIGHTING IMPLICIT

01:11:45.100 --> 01:11:46.335
BIAS AT MANY LEVELS OF OUR

01:11:46.402 --> 01:11:48.671
CULTURE AS WAS MENTIONED AT THE

01:11:48.737 --> 01:11:49.605
BEGINNING THAT WE HAVE WE

01:11:49.672 --> 01:11:52.441
TACKLE ANOTHER AREAS BUT IT'S

01:11:52.508 --> 01:11:54.510
ESPECIALLY. FUN HARMFUL IN THIS

01:11:54.576 --> 01:11:56.645
AREA IN ROB'S COMMITTEES COLORS

01:11:56.712 --> 01:11:59.081
OF MUSIC COLOR THE MOST BASIC

01:11:59.148 --> 01:12:01.116
NEED OF A SAFE PLACE TO LIVE.

01:12:01.183 --> 01:12:02.284
IN MY OWN DISAGREED ON A NUMBER

01:12:02.351 --> 01:12:04.687
OF. MEETINGS RECENTLY WERE JUST

01:12:04.753 --> 01:12:05.788
COMING TO GRIPS AYE I'VE

01:12:05.854 --> 01:12:08.524
LEARNED A LOT. ABOUT THE

01:12:08.590 --> 01:12:10.859
HISTORY STRUCTURE RACISM AND IN

01:12:10.926 --> 01:12:13.929
HOUSING AND MY COMMUNITIES- AND

01:12:13.996 --> 01:12:16.799
THE- DAMAGES INFLICTED ON

01:12:16.865 --> 01:12:18.000
PEOPLE OF COLOR NOT ONLY THE

01:12:18.067 --> 01:12:20.135
RED LINE BUT- IT PREVENTED FROM

01:12:20.202 --> 01:12:20.536
LIVING IN CERTAIN

01:12:20.602 --> 01:12:22.104
NEIGHBOURHOODS HISTORICALLY.

01:12:22.171 --> 01:12:23.138
BUT REALLY THAT DENIES A

01:12:23.205 --> 01:12:24.073
GENERATIONAL WEALTH THAT

01:12:24.139 --> 01:12:26.241
HOMEOWNERSHIP. BRINGS WHICH

01:12:26.308 --> 01:12:27.810
BROADENS THE WHICH WIDENS THE

01:12:27.876 --> 01:12:29.445
RACIAL ECONOMIC DIVIDE IN OUR

01:12:29.511 --> 01:12:31.413
COUNTRY SO I THINK THIS IS A

01:12:31.480 --> 01:12:36.418
STRONG STEP FORWARD. AND. I AM

01:12:36.485 --> 01:12:37.186

01:12:37.252 --> 01:12:39.888
THANK YOU SENATOR CENTER JONES.

01:12:39.955 --> 01:12:41.790

ABOUT THE BILL AND SIMILAR TO

01:12:43.759 --> 01:12:45.427
SB FORTY EIGHT EARLIER I THINK

01:12:45.494 --> 01:12:47.996
THE LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO SET A

01:12:48.063 --> 01:12:50.666
REALLY HIGH BAR AND SHOW SOME

01:12:50.733 --> 01:12:52.468
RESTRAINT WHEN WERE-

01:12:52.534 --> 01:12:53.969
INTERFERING WITH THE DIFFERENT

01:12:54.036 --> 01:12:55.771
BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS AND HOW

01:12:55.838 --> 01:12:58.273
THEY- ESTABLISH CONTINUING

01:12:58.340 --> 01:13:00.042
EDUCATION. I CERTAINLY AGREE

01:13:00.109 --> 01:13:02.878
WITH THE AUTHOR- HER CONCERNS

01:13:02.945 --> 01:13:03.545
AND THAT THE STORY THAT SHE

01:13:03.612 --> 01:13:05.647
SHARED THAT SHE SHARED WITH ME

01:13:05.714 --> 01:13:08.450
PERSONALLY- IN IT AND THAT IS A

01:13:08.517 --> 01:13:10.652
TROUBLESOME STORY- YOU KNOW

01:13:10.719 --> 01:13:11.754
MAYBE APPRAISERS WE NEED TO BE

01:13:11.820 --> 01:13:14.389
LOOKING AT AT THEIR CONTINUING

01:13:14.456 --> 01:13:16.658
EDUCATION PROGRAM AS WELL. I DO

01:13:16.725 --> 01:13:19.561
BELIEVE THAT- I HAVE A VERY

01:13:19.628 --> 01:13:21.163
CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE

01:13:21.230 --> 01:13:22.531
THREE REALTOR ASSOCIATIONS IN

01:13:22.598 --> 01:13:24.133
MY IN IN MY COUNTY IN SAN DIEGO

01:13:24.199 --> 01:13:27.669
COUNTY- THAT REPRESENT- A HUGE

01:13:27.736 --> 01:13:29.905
NUMBER REALTORS. AND I THINK

01:13:29.972 --> 01:13:32.141
YOU KNOW ALL THREE OF THEIR

01:13:32.207 --> 01:13:36.211
BOARDS ARE- IT IS THERE'S A LOT

01:13:36.278 --> 01:13:37.346
OF DIVERSITY ON ALL THREE OF

01:13:37.412 --> 01:13:41.784
THOSE BOARDS THE- THE SPEAKER

01:13:41.850 --> 01:13:43.585
AND SUPPORT OF THE- BILL

01:13:43.652 --> 01:13:44.787
ACTUALLY REYES ONE OF MY

01:13:44.853 --> 01:13:47.756
CONCERNS IS THERE'S- FOUR

01:13:47.823 --> 01:13:48.257
HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND

01:13:48.323 --> 01:13:50.759
LICENSEES. AND CALIFORNIA AND

01:13:50.826 --> 01:13:52.661
LESS THAN HALF OF THOSE ARE

01:13:52.728 --> 01:13:54.396
RECOGNIZED AS CAPITAL ARE

01:13:54.463 --> 01:13:57.733
REALTORS. AND SO WE'RE

01:13:57.800 --> 01:13:58.300
PROPOSING YOU KNOW SOMETHING

01:13:58.367 --> 01:14:02.938
THAT. YOU KNOW THE PROCESS

01:14:03.005 --> 01:14:03.605
ENTIRE SPECTRUM OF THE

01:14:03.672 --> 01:14:06.475
INDUSTRY- AND SO THAT THAT

01:14:06.542 --> 01:14:08.377
RAISES CONCERN FOR ME ONE OF

01:14:08.443 --> 01:14:10.212
THE OTHER CONCERNS AND I WOULD

01:14:10.279 --> 01:14:11.346
IF THE AUTHOR WOULD MIND

01:14:11.413 --> 01:14:13.549
SPEAKING TO THIS- THE ROLE PLAY

01:14:13.615 --> 01:14:16.218
COMPONENT. YOU KNOW MOST OF THE

01:14:16.285 --> 01:14:18.020
I THINK ALL OF THE REALTOR

01:14:18.086 --> 01:14:20.155
CONTINUE EDUCATION NOW CAN BE

01:14:20.222 --> 01:14:21.957
DONE ONLINE THROUGH THE GRE.

01:14:22.024 --> 01:14:26.862
AND IS THAT CREATES- A UNIQUE

01:14:26.929 --> 01:14:28.297
CIRCUMSTANCE OR DO A ROLE PLAY

01:14:28.363 --> 01:14:31.366
SO IF THE SPEAKER WOULD. LIKE

01:14:31.433 --> 01:14:32.801
TO EXPLAIN THAT I AM CURIOUS

01:14:32.868 --> 01:14:33.936
ABOUT HOW THE ROLE PLAYED THING

01:14:34.002 --> 01:14:36.905
WOULD WORK BUT UNFORTUNATELY I

01:14:36.972 --> 01:14:37.472

01:14:44.813 --> 01:14:46.748
LICENSEES BUT- I THINK I THE

01:14:46.815 --> 01:14:48.183
CONVERSATIONS HAVE TO START I

01:14:48.250 --> 01:14:49.351
JUST WANTED TO SHARE THAT AND

01:14:49.418 --> 01:14:51.053
THERE'S DOCUMENTATION SOMETIMES

01:14:51.119 --> 01:14:52.154
WE DON'T EVEN REALIZE BECAUSE

01:14:52.221 --> 01:14:53.789
IT'S NOT. SOMETHING THAT W CAN

01:14:53.856 --> 01:14:55.224
WE THINK ABOUT SO I JUST WANTED

01:14:55.290 --> 01:14:57.025
TO SHARE THAT CURRENTLY- THERE

01:14:57.092 --> 01:14:58.994
IS A REPORT THAT CAME OUT THAT

01:14:59.061 --> 01:15:00.696
SPEAKS TO THE HOMES. AND

01:15:00.762 --> 01:15:02.397
NEIGHBORHOODS WITH SIMILAR

01:15:02.464 --> 01:15:05.100
AMENITIES AND LOS ANGELES WERE

01:15:05.167 --> 01:15:08.103
BLACK MAJORITY NEIGHBORHOODS

01:15:08.170 --> 01:15:09.972
FOR SEVENTEEN POINT 1% LESS.

01:15:10.038 --> 01:15:12.708
THEIR WORTH IS LESS 71% JUST

01:15:12.774 --> 01:15:14.376
FOR BEING A BLACK NEIGHBORHOODS

01:15:14.443 --> 01:15:17.646
IN THE BAY AREA. LOCATED IN

01:15:17.713 --> 01:15:19.615
BLUE MUCH NEIGHBORHOOD IS

01:15:19.681 --> 01:15:21.049
TWENTY SEVEN POINT ONE PERCENT.

01:15:21.116 --> 01:15:22.651
LESS SO I KNOW THAT THESE ARE

01:15:22.718 --> 01:15:23.352
NOT THINGS THAT WE TYPICALLY

01:15:23.418 --> 01:15:24.987
THINK ABOUT IT BUT WHEN YOU

01:15:25.053 --> 01:15:26.355
LOOK AT THE DISPARITY IN AND

01:15:26.421 --> 01:15:28.257
OUT OF THE PROPERTY VALUE JUST

01:15:28.323 --> 01:15:29.024
BECAUSE IT'S A MINORITY

01:15:29.091 --> 01:15:30.692
COMMUNITY. MY MINORITY OWNED

01:15:30.759 --> 01:15:32.828
COMMUNITY. IT IS SOMETHING THAT

01:15:32.895 --> 01:15:34.630
IT IS IT IS REALLY MIND

01:15:34.696 --> 01:15:35.931
BOGGLING FOR ME PERSONALLY AS A

01:15:35.998 --> 01:15:38.667
MINORITY. FEMALE AND MISTER

01:15:38.734 --> 01:15:40.769
JONES AP SHARE COMMENT. BUT

01:15:40.836 --> 01:15:41.837
IT'S A CONVERSATION THAT NEEDS

01:15:41.904 --> 01:15:43.739
TO HAPPEN AND I THINK THAT JUST

01:15:43.805 --> 01:15:45.374
HAVING THIS KNOWLEDGE DOESN'T.

01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:47.276
HURT BUT IT DOES HELP MOVING

01:15:47.342 --> 01:15:49.044
FORWARD AND THEN I WILL HI

01:15:49.111 --> 01:15:50.445
WELCOME TO SIT DOWN WITH YOU

01:15:50.512 --> 01:15:51.747

SENATOR I WANT TO THANK MY

01:15:59.788 --> 01:16:01.089
COLLEAGUES FOR BRINGING THIS

01:16:01.156 --> 01:16:04.026
BILL- I THINK THE WHOLE POINT

01:16:04.092 --> 01:16:06.828
OF IMPLICIT RACIAL BIAS. AND I

01:16:06.895 --> 01:16:08.063
HAVE CONFESSED THIS IS NOT A

01:16:08.130 --> 01:16:09.765
FIELD I'M SUPER FAMILIAR WITH

01:16:09.831 --> 01:16:11.833
BUT I HAVE HAD COLLEAGUES IN

01:16:11.900 --> 01:16:13.201
THE PAST WHO ARE LEADING

01:16:13.268 --> 01:16:15.570
EXPERTS IN THIS AREA HI AND I

01:16:15.637 --> 01:16:16.772
THINK THAT SOME OF THE ID HERE

01:16:16.838 --> 01:16:18.674
IT'S IS THAT A SIMPLICITY IT'S

01:16:18.740 --> 01:16:20.542
COMES FROM PEOPLE WHO. YOU KNOW

01:16:20.609 --> 01:16:22.811
THESE ARE NOT THE KKK OR OPEN

01:16:22.878 --> 01:16:24.913
RACISTS OF THE PASSER THERE

01:16:24.980 --> 01:16:25.514
PEOPLE THAT ARE WE WOULD CALL

01:16:25.580 --> 01:16:27.616
GOOD PEOPLE- THEY THEY THINK OF

01:16:27.683 --> 01:16:29.584
THEMSELVES OF RACE NEUTRAL BUT

01:16:29.651 --> 01:16:31.053
WE ALL HAVE RACIAL BIASES I

01:16:31.119 --> 01:16:33.055
HAVE RACIAL BIASES EVERYONE IN

01:16:33.121 --> 01:16:34.890
THIS ROOM HAS RACIAL BIASES.

01:16:34.957 --> 01:16:36.124
AND I THINK THE WHOLE POINT OF

01:16:36.191 --> 01:16:37.893
AN EDUCATIONAL ENVIRONMENT IS

01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:40.162
TO RECOGNIZE THAT NOW MANY OF

01:16:40.228 --> 01:16:41.129
US MAY HAVE READ THAT STORY

01:16:41.196 --> 01:16:43.231
ABOUT. THE BLACK COUPLE IN

01:16:43.298 --> 01:16:45.801
MARIN. AND THEN IT GOT AN

01:16:45.867 --> 01:16:47.636
APPRAISAL FOR THEIR HOME. ARE

01:16:47.703 --> 01:16:49.404
THEY THOUGHT IT WAS LOW AND SO

01:16:49.471 --> 01:16:50.572
THEY WENT OUT AND GOT A WHITE

01:16:50.639 --> 01:16:51.940
FRIEND OF THEIRS TO POSE AS THE

01:16:52.007 --> 01:16:54.743
HOME BUYER- THAT NEXT APPRAISAL

01:16:54.810 --> 01:16:56.311
THEY HAD WITH THE WHITE THIS

01:16:56.378 --> 01:16:58.847
PRINCIPLES AT HOME BUYER WAS

01:16:58.914 --> 01:16:59.448
FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS

01:16:59.514 --> 01:17:01.750
GREATER. HI THIS IS ONE OF MANY

01:17:01.817 --> 01:17:03.218
EXAMPLES IN THIS ONE WAS VERY

01:17:03.285 --> 01:17:05.721
STARKLY DOCUMENTED I IT WAS IN

01:17:05.787 --> 01:17:06.621
THE NEWS THROUGHOUT THE

01:17:06.688 --> 01:17:09.558
COUNTRY. BUT IF YOU ARE

01:17:09.624 --> 01:17:10.425
PARTICULARLY UNDERREPRESENTED

01:17:10.492 --> 01:17:12.728
MINORITY YOU ARE FACING THIS

01:17:12.794 --> 01:17:14.596
TYPE OF IMPLICIT RACIAL BIAS

01:17:14.663 --> 01:17:17.199
THROUGHOUT YOUR LIFE AND AS

01:17:17.265 --> 01:17:18.633
MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE

01:17:18.700 --> 01:17:19.901
ELOQUENTLY POINTED OUT

01:17:19.968 --> 01:17:24.406
HOMEOWNERSHIP. IS SO IMPORTANT.

01:17:24.473 --> 01:17:26.475
FOR BUILDING AT FOR. WEALTH AND

01:17:26.541 --> 01:17:28.010
IT IS SO IMPORTANT AS A RESULT

01:17:28.076 --> 01:17:30.779
THAT WE TRY TO DO ALL WE CAN TO

01:17:30.846 --> 01:17:33.015
AND IMPLICIT RACIAL BIAS. IN

01:17:33.081 --> 01:17:34.716
THIS REGARD AND SO I THINK THIS

01:17:34.783 --> 01:17:36.618
IS A GREAT FIRST STEP I WOULD

01:17:36.685 --> 01:17:38.086
ENCOURAGE ALL OF US TO THINK

01:17:38.153 --> 01:17:39.154
ABOUT WHAT WE MIGHT DO GOING

01:17:39.221 --> 01:17:41.023
FORWARD BECAUSE EDUCATION. IS

01:17:41.089 --> 01:17:42.824
IMPORTANT BUT MAY NOT BE ENOUGH

01:17:42.891 --> 01:17:44.026
AND I LOOK FORWARD TO LEARNING

01:17:44.092 --> 01:17:45.594
MORE ABOUT WHAT WE AS A BODY

01:17:45.660 --> 01:17:47.963

01:17:48.030 --> 01:17:51.166
IMPORTANT. ASPECT OF. OUR

COMING IN- THE VALUE COMING IN

01:20:10.305 --> 01:20:12.574
LOWER THAN WHAT IT WOULD

01:20:12.641 --> 01:20:14.876
COMMAND IF A WHITE COUPLE WERE

01:20:14.943 --> 01:20:16.511
SHOWING THE HOME AND WHAT I'M

BILL RELATES TO- REAL ESTATE

01:20:20.749 --> 01:20:24.286

OF HOMES RATE. SO IF THAT'S-

01:20:31.359 --> 01:20:33.695
WHAT WE'RE FOCUSING ON. IT

01:20:33.762 --> 01:20:36.298
DOESN'T SEEM LIKE IT ADDRESSES-

01:20:36.364 --> 01:20:39.501

01:20:53.048 --> 01:20:54.549
ISSUE FROM ALL ANGLES WHEN I

EXAMPLES ON THE BOOKS IN TERMS

FUTURE TO TACKLE THE APPRAISER

PARTICULAR GIVEN THE HISTORICAL

01:21:18.673 --> 01:21:20.942

01:21:21.009 --> 01:21:23.078
BIASES IT'S JUST INFORMATIVE

01:21:23.144 --> 01:21:24.646
AND I THINK AS I STATED EARLIER

01:21:24.713 --> 01:21:26.648
HE JUST HELPED EVERYONE START

01:21:26.715 --> 01:21:28.283
THINKING ABOUT THESE ISSUES AND

01:21:28.350 --> 01:21:28.917
JUST RECOGNIZING YOUR OWN

QUESTION WAS RAISED BY ONE OF

01:21:38.727 --> 01:21:39.894
MY COMMENTS AND SO I JUST

01:21:39.961 --> 01:21:40.829
WANTED TO QUICKLY ADDRESS THAT.

01:21:40.895 --> 01:21:42.931
OF COURSE THIS BILL REFERS TO

STAFF LIKE A P. A R. AND HE

02:25:45.703 --> 02:25:48.773
DOES. BUT WHAT ARE EAGER IS

02:25:48.840 --> 02:25:50.575
THAT BACK IN RADIO SAFE AND THE

02:25:50.641 --> 02:25:52.276
BACKGROUND IS A RETAIL.

02:25:52.343 --> 02:25:54.078
TECHNOLOGISTS THE REALLY

02:25:54.145 --> 02:25:55.313

SO I APPRECIATE THAT BUT I

02:26:18.769 --> 02:26:22.974
THINK AT LEAST. ONE OF THE-

02:26:23.040 --> 02:26:25.376
SOMETHING'S FALLING HERE SO ONE

02:26:25.443 --> 02:26:27.111
OF THE PREMISES BILL IS THAT

02:26:27.178 --> 02:26:28.880

A LITTLE MORE LIGHT ON THAT ARE

02:26:47.732 --> 02:26:52.436
GONNA BE GRATEFUL. IT DOESN'T

02:26:52.503 --> 02:26:56.040
IT DOES NOT PRECLUDE. THOSE WHO

02:26:56.107 --> 02:26:58.075

SOME OF THE COST POTENTIALLY A

02:28:28.232 --> 02:28:28.733
I ASSUME THIS WOULD DRIVE UP

02:28:28.799 --> 02:28:30.801
MEDICAL COSTS- IT MIGHT LEAD TO

02:28:30.868 --> 02:28:33.304

COMPETITION IN CALIFORNIA I

02:39:05.636 --> 02:39:08.739
WOULD STAY BETWEEN NINETY AND A

02:39:08.805 --> 02:39:09.239
HUNDRED AND TEN THOUSAND

02:39:09.306 --> 02:39:11.275

TELL YOU WHERE I'M COMING FROM

OF THIS COMMITTEE I CERTAINLY

02:39:33.030 --> 02:39:34.131
WANT SOMEBODY TO THINK ABOUT

02:39:34.197 --> 02:39:35.966
THISAND MY BASIC QUESTION IS

02:39:36.033 --> 02:39:38.302
WHAT HAPPENS TO THE PARTIES

02:39:38.368 --> 02:39:39.569
THAT ARE OUT THERE WORKING IN

02:39:39.636 --> 02:39:42.172

02:39:42.239 --> 02:39:44.808
AND TWO. ARE YOU SENATOR ARE

02:39:47.911 --> 02:39:50.013
ORPHANS OUT OF THIS EXISTING.

02:39:50.080 --> 02:39:52.582
CADRE OF. RADIOLOGIC

02:39:52.649 --> 02:39:54.384
TECHNOLOGISTS AND TECHNICIANS

02:39:54.451 --> 02:39:56.887
ARE EMPLOYED IN WORKPLACES ALL

02:39:56.954 --> 02:39:57.421
UP AND DOWN THE STATE OF

02:39:57.487 --> 02:39:59.289
CALIFORNIA. THOSE ARE TWO

02:39:59.356 --> 02:40:00.457
QUESTIONS AND THE REASON FOR

02:40:00.524 --> 02:40:02.225
THE QUESTIONS AS WE HAVE WE

02:40:02.292 --> 02:40:04.394
HAVE SEEN IT TO SOME EXTENT. IN

02:40:04.461 --> 02:40:06.229
THE NURSING PROFESSION WORK

02:40:06.296 --> 02:40:07.798
OUTSTANDING COMMUNITY COLLEGE

02:40:07.864 --> 02:40:10.033
NURSING PROGRAMS. TURNOUT

02:40:10.100 --> 02:40:11.935
ASSOCIATE DEGREE IN NURSING.

02:40:12.002 --> 02:40:14.671
STUDENTS BUT BECAUSE OF A

02:40:14.738 --> 02:40:16.406
VARIETY OF PREFERENCES IN THE

02:40:16.473 --> 02:40:18.342
HEALTH CARE. ENVIRONMENT

02:40:18.408 --> 02:40:20.177
HOSPITALS AND OTHERS PREFER

02:40:20.243 --> 02:40:22.312
BACHELOR'S DEGREE NURSES. AND

OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE.

02:40:27.718 --> 02:40:30.253
GRADUATES OF NURSING PROGRAMS

02:40:30.320 --> 02:40:31.788
AND I'D CERTAINLY HATE FOR THE

02:40:31.855 --> 02:40:33.857
LEGISLATURE TO CREATE. ANOTHER

02:40:33.924 --> 02:40:35.993
RULE THAT CREATES ORPHANS OUT

02:40:36.059 --> 02:40:37.627
OF FOLKS WHO WERE WORKING

DILIGENTLY IN THE HEALTHCARE

02:40:38.895 --> 02:40:40.130
PROFESSION UP AND DOWN THE

02:40:40.197 --> 02:40:42.566
STATE BECAUSE- EMPLOYERS NOW

02:40:42.632 --> 02:40:45.369
PREFER. TO HIRE RADIOLOGICAL

02:40:45.435 --> 02:40:47.104
ASSISTANCE BECAUSE THE PAY

02:40:47.170 --> 02:40:48.071
DIFFERENTIAL MAY NOT BE THAT

02:40:48.138 --> 02:40:50.974
MUCH. OVER THE OUR TEASER

02:40:51.041 --> 02:40:51.475

THAT TITLE THAT'S THE

02:41:10.861 --> 02:41:12.796
FOUNDATION BUT ALONG WITH THAT

02:41:12.863 --> 02:41:14.297
IS THE ELEMENTS OF EDUCATION

THE ELEMENTS OF A GROWTH WITHIN

02:41:17.234 --> 02:41:18.602
THE INDUSTRY. BUT MORE

02:41:18.668 --> 02:41:20.804
IMPORTANTLY IS THE FACT THAT

02:57:28.838 --> 02:57:30.706
HOME BECAUSE- THE CALIFORNIA

02:57:30.773 --> 02:57:31.841
ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS IS

02:57:31.907 --> 02:57:33.376

KNOWLEDGE OF SOMETHING BY LAW

02:57:39.015 --> 02:57:39.715
THEY HAVE TO DISCLOSE IT IF

02:57:39.782 --> 02:57:42.318
THEY DON'T. THEN THE INSPECTION

02:57:42.385 --> 02:57:43.786
WOULD DISCOVER IT AND THAT'S

02:57:43.853 --> 02:57:45.221
WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT HAVE A

02:57:45.287 --> 02:57:47.356
GOOD DILIGENT INSPECTION MADE

02:57:47.423 --> 02:57:49.191
THAT WILL REVEAL THESE THINGS

02:57:49.258 --> 02:57:50.693
SO WHEN THE HOME INSPECTION

02:57:50.760 --> 02:57:53.029

AND SIT DOWN WITH THE HOMEOWNER

02:58:03.039 --> 02:58:04.874
AND SAY THIS IS WHAT I FOUND

02:58:04.940 --> 02:58:06.275
THESE ARE MY RECOMMENDATIONS

02:58:06.342 --> 02:58:07.777

02:58:13.883 --> 02:58:15.618
SOMEONE ELSE AND AS YOU KNOW AS

02:58:15.684 --> 02:58:17.253
WELL AS I DO THAT ALL OF US

02:58:17.319 --> 02:58:18.888
HAVE A FRIEND OF A FRIEND. WHO

02:58:18.954 --> 02:58:20.423
IS A PLUMBER ELECTRICIAN AND SO

02:58:20.489 --> 02:58:22.191
ON SO MORE THAN LIKELY THE

02:58:22.258 --> 02:58:24.960
CONSUMER MIGHT GET ANOTHER- BID

02:58:25.027 --> 02:58:27.496
AND- OR GET THREE BIDS THIS IS

02:58:27.563 --> 02:58:28.998
WHAT'S RECOMMENDED BY THE

02:58:29.065 --> 02:58:30.966
ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS THREE

02:58:31.033 --> 02:58:33.436
BIDS. SO THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO

02:58:33.502 --> 02:58:35.438
DO THAT SO THE CONSUMER ALWAYS

02:58:35.504 --> 02:58:37.740
HAS THE OPTION TO DO THAT. AND

02:58:37.807 --> 02:58:39.308
SO IN REFERENCE TO ANY CONFLICT

02:58:39.375 --> 02:58:40.910
OF INTEREST I THINK THE

02:58:40.976 --> 02:58:42.244
