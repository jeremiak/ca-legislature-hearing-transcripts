ELECTIONS AND REDISTRICTING COMMITTEE HEARING FOR MAY NINTH TWENTY EIGHTEEN. THERE FIVE BILLS UP IN OUR COMMITTEE TODAY. THREE BILLS. ITEM NUMBER ONE AB TWENTY FIVE FIFTY NINE ITEM NUMBER TWO. AB TWENTY SIX SIXTY FIVE AND I ITEM NUMBER THREE. A. B.. TWENTY EIGHT THIRTY FIVE. ARE ON CONSENT AS WELL AS ITEM NUMBER FIVE A. B. THIRTY TO FIFTY NINE BY THE ELECTIONS ARE DISTURBING COMMITTEE. AS PROPOSED TO BE AMENDED AS SUGGESTED IN COMMON NUMBER SEVEN OF THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. I DOES ANY MEMBER WHICH TERM. BUT WE DON'T A QUORUM SO WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE IT ON THE HEAD. BUT WE DO HAVE AN AUTHOR SO WHEN WE GET STARTED. DOCTOR ARAMBULA. IF YOU'D LIKE TO PRESENT ITEM NUMBER FOUR I BELIEVE. AB TWENTY EIGHT THIRTY NINE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. AB TWENTY EIGHT THIRTY NINE SIMPLY STATES THAT THE VOTING DOMICILE FOR A PERSON WHO IS CLASSIFIED AS A SEXUALLY VIOLENT PREDATOR. AND WHO IS COMMITTED FOR AN INDETERMINATE TERM IN A STATE HOSPITAL. SHALL BE THE PERSON'S LAST KNOWN ADDRESS OF RESIDENTS. THIS BILL WILL ENSURE THAT AN SBP VOTES IN THE COUNTY AND OR CITY WHERE HE OR SHE LAST LIVED. BEFORE THEY WERE CONVICTED OF THEIR SEX OFFENSE. INSTEAD OF THE CITY AND COUNTY WHERE THE STATE HOSPITAL IS LOCATED. COURT RULINGS HAVE GRANTED SDP'S THE RIGHT TO VOTE THIS MEASURE CLARIFIES WHERE AN SP PEAS VOTING DOMICILE IS. EXISTING LAW PROVIDES THAT A PERSON DOES NOT GAIN OR LOSE A DOMICILE SOLELY BY REASON OF HIS OR HER PRESENCE OR ABSENCE. FROM A PLACE WHILE BEING KEPT IN AN ASYLUM ARE PRESENT. THIS BILL JUST CLARIFIES THAT THE VOTING DOMICILE PRESS HE PEES. THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTY SEXUALLY VIOLENT PREDATORS IN CALIFORNIA THAT HAVE BEEN COMMITTED FOR INDETERMINATE TERMS. ALL OF THEM ARE HOUSED A COOLING THE STATE HOSPITAL IN FRESNO COUNTY. MOST OF THEM. IF NOT ALL OF THEM HAVE NO HISTORY OF LIVING IN FRESNO COUNTY OR IN THE CITY OF CALLING. LAST YEAR THE CALLING THE CITY COUNCIL PLACE THE MEASURE ON THE BALLOT. THAT WOULD HAVE INCREASED THE SALES TAX BY ONE PERCENT. THE SALES TAX THAT NEEDED TO ADDRESS THE BUDGET DEFICIT THAT WOULD HAVE ALLOWED THE CITY TO RETAIN TWENTY THREE CITY POSITIONS. MAINTAINING POLICE OFFICER AND FIREFIGHTER STAFFING LEVELS. THE MEASURE WENT BEFORE THE VOTERS IN NOVEMBER OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN. AND THE SALES TAX MEASURE FAILED BY THIRTY SEVEN VOTES. FIVE HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO TO FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE. ACCORDING TO THE CITY MOST OF THE STATE HOSPITALS THREE HUNDRED FOUR REGISTERED VOTERS. VOTED AGAINST THE TAX. AS A RESULT THE CITY WAS FORCED TO CUT TWENTY THREE POSITIONS. AND TO REDUCE THE POLICE FORCE BY TWENTY FIVE PERCENT. THE SP PIECE THAT VOTED AGAINST THE BALLOT MEASURE HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO TIES TO CALLING. AND NO WONDER STANDING OF WHAT THE COMMUNITY NEEDS. INSTEAD THEY MADE UNREASONABLE DEMANDS FOR A SHUTTLE SERVICE TO THE INSTITUTION. ACCESS TO TAXI SERVICES AND LAND FOR A VISITOR CENTER. ALL THINGS THAT THEY CAN'T UTILIZE. IT IS UNFORTUNATE THAT THE SEXUALLY VIOLENT PREDATORS AT. STATE HOSPITAL WHERE ABLE TO AFFECT THE OUTCOME OF AN ISSUE SO IMPORTANT TO THE COMMUNITY. PUBLIC SAFETY. THEIR VOTES IMPACTED THE JOBS OF TWENTY THREE POLICE OFFICERS AND FIREFIGHTERS IN A CITY THAT DESPERATELY NEEDS THEM. THE SP PEAS ARE BEING HOUSED A CALLING THE STATE HOSPITAL BY COURT ORDER. AND MOST IF NOT ALL OF THEM HAVE NEVER LIVED IN PROBABLY NEVER EVEN VISITED CALLING UP BEFORE BEING SENT TO THE STATE INSTITUTION. THIS MEASURE SIMPLY INSURERS THAT THE S. B. PEAS HOUSED AT CAHUENGA ARE VOTING IN COMMUNITIES THAT THEY HAVE SOME TIES TO. AND NOT THE COMMUNITY THAT THEY WERE SENT TO BY COURT ORDER. I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. I HAVE WITH ME THREE WITNESSES MAYOR NATHAN VOSBURG FROM THE CITY OF KALINDA. AND. SORRY BUT WE ALSO HAVE SUSAN FOX FROM A CAPS WHO'S NOT HERE YET. GREAT AND IF.

STEINORTH STEINORTH HERE WEBER. WE HAVE A QUORUM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM SECRETARY. PLEASE CONTINUE THEIR VOTES FOR. MY NAME'S NATHAN VOSBURGH MARRIAGE CITY KALANGA. NAM I COME FROM A SMALL DISENFRANCHISED COMMUNITY. FOR POPULATION FROM TWO THOUSAND. TEN CENSUS WAS THAT THIRTEEN THREE EIGHT. WE HAVE. STATE HOSPITAL WE HAD HAD A A PRISON KARMA BECAUSE THE CENTER. THAT CUTS THROUGH CENTER WAS GIVING US A MILLION DOLLARS OF REVENUE TO GO TO A PUBLIC A SAFETY. DUE TO. AB ONE ON NINE. PROP 47-57 WE HAVE. LOST THAT AND SO WE'VE LOST ALSO THE REVENUE THAT CAME IN WITH IT. WHICH ACTUALLY PUT OUR CITY ABOUT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IN DEBT. AS YOU KNOW ABOUT TWELVE TO FIFTEEN YEARS AGO. WE'D A OUR COUNCIL DID VOTE IN FAVOR OF MAKING DO WITH THE HOSPITAL TO BRING THEM FOR JOBS AND OPPORTUNITY. AT THAT POINT IN TIME A IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE THE SEXUAL ESCAPEES WERE NOT ABLE TO VOTE. IN OUR LOCAL ELECTIONS AT THAT TIME COM. I WAS ACTUALLY AGAINST BRINGING IN THE STATE HOSPITAL. ALONG WITH A LOT OF OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS WERE AGAINST IT WE FIGURED IT WOULD BRING ABOUT ELEMENT. BUT JOBS AND OPPORTUNITIES INTO IMPOVERISHED AREA. THAT'S DISADVANTAGED HIGHLY DISADVANTAGED IN SOME AREAS ON. OVERRODE THAT AND YOU KNOW WE MOVE FOR WHAT THE AND IS ONE OF THE TOP A JOB PROVIDERS THERE HOWEVER EVERYONE SAYS NOT MY BACKYARD. KALANGA ALLOWED THAT'S IN OUR BACKYARD. AND WE ARE WE HAVE WE HAVE DONE EVERYTHING THAT THE STATE HAS ASKED US WE HAD THE CUTS THE CUTS THE CENTER FOR THE STATE WE HAD THE THE STATE HOSPITAL FOR THE STATE. AND UNFORTUNATELY A LOT OF THESE THINGS THAT WE'RE DOING HAVE ACTUALLY COME BACK TO BITE US. THE STATE HOSPITAL SEVER THE TIES WITH OUR HOSPITAL. SO THEY NO LONGER TAKE INMATES OR ANYBODY OVER TO THAT AREA PATIENTS AND SO WE NOW HAVE LOST OUR HOSPITAL AS WELL. SO. WEREN'T WERE WE WERE INFORMING AND DEBT WERE CLIMBING OUR WAY OUT. ARE POLICE AND FIRE ONE BECAUSE OF. ERA PROP 47-57 AB ONE OF NINE HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY OVERWHELMED WE HAVE RE OFFENDERS. IT'S IT'S AMAZING TO SEE IT THEY GET OUT. FROM DOING A CRIME WHEN THEY COMMIT ANOTHER CRIME OUR OFFICERS TAKEN TO FRESNO THERE OUT BEFORE OUR OFFICERS GET HOME. SO WORK THAT'S IT DID CONSTANT DEL THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH SORT TRYING TO GET MORE OFFICERS ON THE STREET. I RAN AGAINST TAXES ARE NOT ATTACKS GUY I GOT IN DEFEATING MEASURE P.. TOM SIMS I GOT IN AND SING THE FOUR MILLION THAT WE'RE IN THE HALL I SAID HEY WE DO SOMETHING SO PERHAPS AND SALES TAX ON THAT WE HAD PRIORITIES WHAT THE SALES TAX IS GOING TO GO FOR. I HAD NO CLUE THAT THE ESCAPEES COULD VOTE UNTIL WE GOT A LETTER FROM DAYS AND THEY HAD A LIST OF DEMANDS THAT WERE NOT IN LINE WITH OUR PRIORITIES. AS YOU GUYS KNOW CITIES ARE NOT PERMITTED TO USE CITY STAFF FOR CITY TIME TO GO OUT IN THE LOBBY ON SOMETHING ON BEHALF WE CAN ONLY TELL EXACTLY. WHAT A THE PRIORITY LIST WAS WHICH WE DID SEND THEM BACK ADD THAT PRIORITY LIST? THEY'RE UNHAPPY WITH THAT A SO ALL OF THEM WELL A LOT OF THE MAJORITY OF THEM VOTED AGAINST ARE MEASURE. NAM TO BEGIN WITH HEY CITIZENS VOTED YOU KNOW. I DID NOT KNOW THAT THE MAJORITY OF THE NO VOTES CAME FROM THAT AREA. A ONCE WE DID SOME RESEARCH BECAUSE I WANT TO FIND OUT EXACTLY WHERE THE VOTES CAME FROM THAT SAID NO BECAUSE I THOUGHT WELL YOU KNOW WE HAD ABOUT A FIFTY PERCENT RATE IN ALL AREAS. WHEN WE FOUND OUT THIS THE STATE HOSPITAL AREA WAS SEVENTY ONE PERCENT AND AGAINST THIS AND ALL THE REST OF OUR DISTRICTS FOR ABOUT FIFTY PERCENT. WE SING THIS WAY SO WE START LOOKING INTO LAW. ARE THESE ARE THE PEOPLE OUT THERE ALLOWED VOTE SO WE STARTED SPECIFICALLY LOOK AT THE DOMICILE LAW SECTION THREE FORTY NINE. WORD STATES THAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE FIX THEIR INTENSE REMAIN AND THEIR INTENT TO RETURN IF AN ABSENCE. I SEE THAT PROBABLY TWO OF THESE THINGS THAT THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO CAPABILITY FOR THEM TO RETURN TO THAT IF THERE APPS ON THAT SCENARIO. AND. NONE OF THOSE PEOPLE ARE FROM KALANGA. SO. I THINK THE CURRENT LAW AS IT SITS. TOM IS IT IS IT IS IS A GOOD LAW BUT I THINK IT NEEDS TO BE CLARIFIED WERE CURRENTLY GOING TO COURT BECAUSE WE CHALLENGE THOSE VOTES. BASED ON A ELECTION CODE THREE FORTY NINE AND SECTION TO CUT TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. NOTHING AGAINST THE PEOPLE OUT THERE AT ALL. YOU KNOW HOWEVER I CAN TELL YOU THAT OUR COMMUNITIES ARE LIVID THE WHOLE CENTRAL VALLEY IS UNHAPPY WITH THIS. ON MY WAY UP HERE I ASKED PEOPLE. WHAT THEY THOUGHT ABOUT YOU KNOW THE ESCAPEES BEEN ALLOWED TO VOTE I DIDN'T EVEN HEAR ONE PERSON SAY THAT THEY SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO VOTE PERIOD MUCH LESS IN OUR LOCAL ELECTIONS WHEN THEY HEARD THAT THEY SWUNG THAT OUR TAX? YOU KNOW PEOPLE WERE REALLY UNHAPPY ABOUT THAT SO I THINK THIS IS A MINORITY AMOUNTS OF PEOPLE THAT DEFINITELY THE VOTING RIGHTS PROTECTED. BUT I'D LIKE TO SEE IT FOR OUR CITIZENS PROTECT AT THE SAME TIME AND KALANGA HOUSING ALL OF A LOT A LOT OR IF NOT ALL OF THESE. A S. B. PEAS I THINK THAT THIS IS A. HOW IT'S THAT MY UBER DRIVER ON THE WAY HERE PUT IT HE SAID THIS IS UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES? AND SO I DISLIKE THEIR TWO WAY TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO IS THAT WE CAN FIX THESE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES AND THE CITY OF KALANGA THAT'S VERY EASY TO DO WE GO BACK TO OUR. AND THE PEOPLE COME TO US WE MAKE COMMITMENTS TO OUR ALLIES FROM EGGMAN INSTRUCT BELLS WOULD WE FIX THOSE THINGS AND SACRAMENTO I'M HERE TO DO THAT EXACT THING. AND I'M HOPING THAT YOU GUYS. WILL YOU KNOW LOOK AT THE SCENARIO AND SAY HEY YOU KNOW KALANGA HAS DONE A LOT FOR THE STATE YOU KNOW WE'RE JUST TRYING TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THESE WITH THESE THINGS IN THAT. YOU KNOW THE CURRENT LAW AS IT SITS ON. IT'S VERY CLEAR BUT WE WOULD WE'RE ASKING A TO SUPPORT AB. TWENTY EIGHT THIRTY NINE AND SUPPORT OF THE AROUND THE BILL I THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WITNESS RON RAMSEY CITY COUNCIL MEMBER FROM COLLECTED GREAT. HELLO THE ELECTION COMMITTEE I MY NAME IS RON RAMSEY AND THE CITY COUNCILMAN FROM THE CITY OF COALINGA. AND I'M ALSO TREASURER OF A CAP IT'S ERIC CALIFORNIA CITIES ALLIED FOR PUBLIC SAFETY. AND. WE JUMPED RIGHT ON THIS THAT AS THEY CAP THERE'S ABOUT TWENTY CITIES AND ALL OVER THE STATE THAT. ARE LOOKING AT THAT'S WERE LOOKING AT. ALL ASPECTS OF THIS STUFF. YEP WERE LOOKING THE DOMICILE TO A PERSON OF. THE I THINK YOU ALL KNOW THIS FROM JUST. REPEATING HEAD BUT A PERSON WHO LEAVES HIS OR HER DOMICILE ARE. HER HOME TO GO TO ANOTHER PRECINCT FOR TEMPORARY PURPOSE WITH THE INTENT OF RETURNING THERE'S NOT LOSE THEIR DOMICILE. SIMILARLY. A THE PERSON DOES NOT GAIN GAIN A DOMICILE. IN ANY PRECINCT IN WHICH THAT HERE SHE COMES TO FOR A TEMPORARY PURPOSE. WITHOUT INTENDING TO MAKE AT. THE PRECINCT HIS OR HER HOME. TO ACQUIRE NEW DOMICILE THEY'RE NOT TO BE BOTH INTENT. TO ACQUIRE A NEW DOMICILE AND THE ACT OF REMOVAL. THE PERSON DID GAIN. GAIN. ADAMBA SAW BECAUSE OF HIM HIS OR HER PRESIDENT. IN THAT PLACE. AND BECOME AN INMATE IS. OR IT OR IN THE PHYLUM WHERE PRESIDENT. ALONG THE SAME LINES WHO'D BEEN RECOGNIZE THAT IN. OF THE MILITARY THE PRESIDENT OF A MILITARY STATION WITHOUT MORE. I CANNOT BE A STATION WHERE THE SERVICEMAN DID DUMB DOWN THE FILE LIST. BECAUSE SERVICEMEN THE SUBJECT TO THE ORDERS OF THEIR SUPERIOR OFFICERS. A. IN THAT THE MARRIAGE OF THORTON NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO. A THERE'S A WHOLE WHOLE STRING APPEAR. A CASES ON IT SIMILARLY IN THE CASE OF. AT PATIENT VOTERS ARE UNDER A COURT ORDER. HERE THEIR COMMITTED THEY HAVE NO CONTROL THERE FREEDOM OF WHERE THEY CAN LIVE SO THEY DON'T HAVE AN ANTENNA. SO THEY HAVE TO GO WHERE THERE TOLD HIM. SO THEY DON'T HAVE THAT INTO. THE POWER TO CHANGE THAT. AND UNTIL THEY DO ARE THEY CAN WE DON'T CARE IF THEY VOTE. IT OUT BUT THEY SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO VOTE FROM A. WHERE THEY ARE? BECAUSE. IT'S IT CHANGES ALL THE TIME SOMETIMES THEY'RE TAKEN OUT OF THE HOSPITAL INTAKE AND OTHER PLACES SO THAT'S NOT A PERMANENT DOMICILE FOR. I I I I I JUST RETIRED FROM THERE. CORRECTIONS. THEN I WORKED AT THE STATE HOSPITAL AND I AND I WORKED AT THAT STATE PRISON BOTH AND I WASN'T TRANSPORTATION. AND WE DID TRANSFEROWN BOTH BOTH PLACES. AND IF A SERVICEMAN CANNOT HAVE A DOMICILE AHEAD OF THEIR BABIES. WHY CAN AN INMATE FLORA A PATIENT? HAVE. IT'S NOT RIGHT. IF A UP SERVICEMEN CAN'T DO IT. WHY CAN HAPPEN CONVICTED? CRIMINAL OR A PERSON THAT'S. IN THERE TO SEE IF THEY'RE GOING TO RECOMMIT. WHY SHOULD THEY HAVE THE SAME RIGHTS AND WITH THAT? I I WOULD LIKE YOU TO A. LOOK FOR HIS BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. AND THE MORNING SUZANNE FACTS ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA CITIES ALLIED WITH PUBLIC SAFETY IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING TONYA STALLS MAYOR PRO TEM KALANGA IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SEEN KNOW ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION MY ANGER I'M LEGISLATIVE ATTORNEY WITH THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA GOOD MORNING AND WE ARE HERE RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION. WE UNDERSTAND AND EMPATHIZE WITH THE FUNDING ISSUES IN COALINGA AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE CONSTITUENCY HERE MIGHT NOT BE THE MOST SYMPATHETIC POPULATION. BUT WE THINK CHANGE IN THE VOTING RIGHTS OF JUST ONE CONSTITUENCY BASED ON. THE OUTCOME OF ONE ELECTION IS ON SOUND PUBLIC POLICY. IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE SPELL ONLY TARGETS ONE SET OF PATIENTS AT THE STATE HOSPITAL NOT. THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN ADJUDICATED A SEXUALLY VIOLENT PREDATOR NOT THE OTHER PATIENTS THAT RESIDE THERE. ITS MARGIN OF THAT THESE ARE PATIENTS THEIR CIVILLY COMMITTED NOT CRIMINALLY COMMITTED LIBERTIES SERVE THEIR CRIMINAL SENSE AND LIKE MANY OTHERS OF CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS IN THE STATE. THEY HAVE VOTING RIGHTS AFTERWARDS AS LONG AS THEY MEET THE OTHER VOTING CRITERIA. ALSO POINTED OUT THAT THESE ARE LENGTHY CIVIL COMMITMENTS AS THE ANALYSIS POINTS OUT SINCE TWO THOUSAND SIX ABOUT A THOUSAND OF THESE PATIENTS HAVE BEEN COMMITTED TO THE STATE HOSPITAL. IN A DOZEN YEARS LATER EIGHTY PERCENT OF THEM REMAIN THERE SO THEY'RE IN THIS HOSPITAL FOR A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TIME. UNDER CURRENT LAW THEY CAN REGISTER TO VOTE AND THE COMMUNITIES THAT THEY CAN RESIDE FROM BUT THE SPELL ONLY LIMITS THEM TO THAT REGION. AND WE THINK THAT'S ON SOUND POLICY PUBLIC POLICY THAT'S NOT WHERE THEY LIVE THEY'RE NOT BEEN IMPACTED BY. THE LOCAL DECISIONS OF ELECTED OFFICIALS THEIR ADDRESS MAY NOT PHYSICALLY EXIST ANYMORE THEY'VE ALREADY SERVED A CRIMINAL SENTENCE NOW THEY HAVE A LINK THE CIVIL COMMITMENT SIGNIFICANT TIME HAS PASSED. THEY MAY NO LONGER HAVE FAMILY OR COMMUNITY TIES TO THE REGION THEY CAME FROM. IT'S ALSO% IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT THE CITY DID MAKE A CHOICE HERE THEY CHOSE TO ANNEX THE HOSPITAL. AND THAT CREATED TAX BENEFITS FOR THE CITY BUT IT ALSO GAVE PATIENTS AT THAT HOSPITAL THE RIGHT TO VOTE IN THAT AREA. AND NOW WE UNDERSTAND THE DISSATISFACTION WITH THESE ELECTION RESULTS BUT FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGING THE VOTING RIGHTS OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS AS THE RESULT OF ONE CLOSE ELECTION. WE THINK IS UNSOUND COURSE FOR THE STATE TO TAKE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN BERMAN GOOD MORNING VICE CHAIRMAN HARPER. AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO AB TWENTY EIGHT THIRTY NINE MY NAME IS JANICE BALUCHI AND I'M A CIVIL RIGHTS ATTORNEY. I'M ALSO EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE ALLIANCE FOR CONSTITUTIONAL SEX OFFENSE LAWS WHICH IS A NON FAT THAT'S COMPRISED OF OVER A HUNDRED AND FIVE THOUSAND CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS AND FAMILIES. MY TESTIMONY TODAY BY THE WAY IS IN ADDITION TO MY LETTER OF SIMILAR TO THE COMMITTEE THAT STATE ABLE TWENTY FIFTH. AS CURRENTLY WRITTEN AB TWENTY EIGHT THIRTY NINE WOULD DISENFRANCHISE HUNDREDS OF CALIFORNIA CITIZENS WHO ARE PATIENTS I CALLING A STATE HOSPITAL. WHILE IT'S TRUE THAT ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE PATIENTS. ARE HER HAVE BEEN DESIGNATED A SEXUALLY VIOLENT PREDATORS IT'S ALSO TRUE THAT STATE LAW HAS DECLARED AND CASE LAW HAS DETERMINED THAT ALL PATIENTS WERE NOT ON PAROLE ELIGIBLE TO VOTE. I IN FACT ELIGIBILITY TO VOTE IS NOT AT ISSUE AND AB TWENTY EIGHT THIRTY NINE BUT WHAT IS AT ISSUE IN THE BILL IS WHERE ELIGIBLE BUT A PATIENTS MAY VOTE. CURRENTLY PATIENTS ARE ALLOWED TO CHOOSE THEIR OWN DOMICILE THIS'S BEEN ESTABLISHED BY CASE LAW FOR STUDENTS FOR MILITARY MEMBERS PRISONERS AT CETERA. AND BECAUSE OF THAT THE PATIENTS OFTEN MAKE THEIR CHOICE BASED UPON WHERE THEY WILL BE DIRECTLY AFFECTED. MOST PATIENTS ARE CALLING A STATE HOSPITAL WHO ARE ELIGIBLE TO VOTE HAVE CHOSEN THE CITY OF COALINGA AS THEIR DOMICILE. AND THAT'S BECAUSE MOST OF LIFT AT THE HOSPITAL TWELVE TEN YEARS OR LONGER. AND THEY ARE ALSO DIRECTLY AFFECTED BY ISSUES SUCH AS THE CITIES. SALES TAX IT'S THEY PAY WHEN THEY PURCHASE FOOD CLOTHING AND ELECTRONICS AT THE HOSPITALS RETAIL OUTLETS. THEY'VE CHOSEN THE CITY OF CALLING UP BECAUSE THEY NO LONGER HAVE TIES TO THE LAST KNOWN ADDRESS BEFORE THEY WERE COMMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL. AND IF THEY TRY TO VOTE AT THE LAST KNOWN ADDRESS IT'S DOUBTFUL THAT THE COULD EVEN QUALIFIES VOTERS ON THAT COMMUNITY. THE FACT IS THAT AT LEAST NINETY FIVE PERCENT OF THE PATIENTS ARE CALLING THE STATE HOSPITAL WILL LIVE AT THE HOSPITAL UNTIL THEY DIE. NINETY FIVE PERCENT IF THEY ARE NOT ALLOWED TO VOTE IN THE CITY OF COALINGA THEY WILL SUFFER TAXATION WITHOUT REPRESENTATION. FOR THESE REASONS WE URGE YOU ALL TO VOTE NO ON AB TWENTY EIGHT THIRTY NINE. THANK YOU THINGS WITH. ARM FELLOW COMMITTEE MY NAME IS ROBERT TURNER I COME FROM FRESNO CALIFORNIA I LIVED STATE HOSPITAL AS A PATIENT FOR SIX YEARS. AND WAS RELEASED UNCONDITIONALLY. WITH OUR FIFTY DARTS MY NAME AND IT UP IN ALMOST SHALL TURN FRESNO. I'M CURRENTLY WORKING WITH THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE THERE OUR I WAS THE LEE A COMMUNITY LIAISON FOR THAT DETAINEE AMERICANS FOR CIVIC EQUALITY OR DAIS. IN THE RUN UP PRIOR TO THE ELECTION I WAS THE. I INTERMEDIARY WHO WAS. TALKING TO THE CITY MANAGER. AND COMMUNICATING BETWEEN. THEM INDIA PATIENTS IN THE HOSPITAL. FIFTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE THREE HUNDRED TWENTY REGISTER VOTERS TO THE HOSPITAL CAST BALLOTS. COMPARED TO TWENTY ONE PERCENT IN THE CITY. EVEN SO FIFTY OF THE HUNDREDS SEVENTY SEVEN PATIENTS WHO VOTED. WERE FOR THE MEASURE. SO THE PATIENT MANY OF THE PATIENTS WERE SYMPATHETIC TO THE CITY'S NEEDS. AND VOTE. MATTER. WHILE IT'S TRUE THAT THE PATIENT VOTE TIP THE BALANCE AGAINST THE TAX INCREASE IS SELDOM MENTIONED THAT WITHOUT THE PATIENT VOTE THE MEASURE WOULD HAVE ONLY BARELY PASSED BY FORTY VOTES. IN THE CITY WITHOUT THE WITHOUT THE HOSPITAL VOTES. IT DID NOT HAVE THE OVERWHELMING SUPPORT OF THE CITY AND YET THE HOUSE WILL PATIENTS HAVE BEEN SCAPEGOATED. FOR MEASURE SEES LOTS AND THE CITY IS SUING IN COURT TO DISQUALIFY THE PATIENTS VOTES REVERSED THE RESULT THE ELECTION SO THEY CAN HAVE THEIR TAX MONEY. PATIENTS PAY SALES TAX WILL ARE ON PURCHASE AT THE HOSPIAL THIS WOULD ADD TO THE PENNY. TO THE DOLLAR THAT'S TRUE AND AND THIS IS BEING CHARACTERIZED AS PENNIES ON AYE I DON'T HAMBURGER COST. BUT I N. AND PEOPLE DO LIKE TO AND PATIENTS ALIKE GO TO THE GRILL. ARE THEY PREFER THAT TO THE CAFETERIA FARE AND MANY CASES SOLAT MONEY IS SPENT THEIR. SOME OF THE PATIENTS MANY OF THE PATIENTS ONLY GET TWELVE FIFTY A MONTH. THAT'S THEIR ALLOWANCE OTHER PATIENTS GET MONEY SENATE FROM OUTSIDE. THEY CAN ONLY HAVE UP TO FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS THEY SHARE THAT WITH A LOT OF OTHER PATIENTS TAKING OF THE GRAIL. AND AND THEY CAN BUY THINGS. ARE. I'VE FROM MY BY MAIL ORDER. BOOKS TELEVISION VIDEO GAME PLAYERS AND GAMES DVDS AND CD PLAYERS AND DEATHS. EVEN JEWELRY AT SOME CLOTHING ITEMS HAVE THEIR LOUD. THERE IS THE POTENTIAL HERE FOR THE CITY TO GAIN THOUSANDS IF NOT TENS OF THOUSAND DOLLARS FROM THE PURCHASES THAT ARE MADE. BY THE PATIENTS AT THE AT THE HOSPITAL. ARE WHILE I HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING EXACTLY HOW LITTLE OR HOW LARGE THIS MATT WOULD BE. FOR THE CITY NEVERTHELESS THERE'S A THERE'S IMPORTANT PRINCIPLE STAKE HERE. WHAT AB TWO EIGHTY NINE IS ATTEMPTING TO DO IS TO ENSURE THAT THE CITY OF COALINGA CAN TAX THE CIVIL DETAINEES? THE STATE HOSPITAL WHILE ALLOWING THEM NO SAY IN WHO WILL DETERMINE HOW THOSE MONIES ARE SPENT. THIS IS TAXATION WITHOUT REPRESENTATION PUT IT SUCCINCTLY. AND THAT'S WHY THE REASONS WHY THIS COUNTRY DECLARED ITS INDEPENDENCE. THE BILL AUTHORED AT THE BEHEST OF THE CITY COALINGA IS PROFOUNDLY UNAMERICAN BOTH IN ITS EFFECT AND IN THIS INTENT. THE CITY IS TRYING TO DISENFRANCHISE A GROUP OF ITS OWN CITIZENS. BECAUSE THEY DO NOT LIKE THE WAY THAT THEY VOTED AND CITY ELECTION. I RECOMMEND THAT THE COMMITTEE REJECT THIS BILL. AND. IF I MAY ADD THERE IS A SOLUTION IF THEY DON'T WANT. THE PATIENTS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE CITY ELECTION AND THAT IS TO TAKE THAT SQUARE MILE THAT INCLUDES THE PRISON. AND HOSPITAL AND REMOVE IT FROM THE CITY IT'S AN OUTLIER. BUT THAT WOULD IMMEDIATELY DROPPED THE POPULATION THAT CITY BY FIVE THOUSAND. AND I DON'T THINK THEY WANT TO DO THAT. ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. EVELYN I'LL HASN'T DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA WE ALIGN OUR COMMENTS WITH THE ACLU THE OUTCOME OF AN ELECTION SHOULD. BE THE BASIS FOR CHANGING OF A PARTICULAR CLASSES DOMICILE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN OF MEMBERS NICK BROKE OUT HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THIS BILL FOR THE REASONS STATED BY THE ACLU. THANK YOU. YOUR MIND TO FROM SACRAMENTO YEAH OPPOSES SPIEL. THANK YOU.

I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY REMEMBER PLEASE WITH THEIR PATIENTS ARE NOT PRISONERS. THEY HAVE RIGHTS THOSE RIGHTS SOME OF THEM ARE TO VOTE. AND THEY ARE GOING TO BE OR ARE. MOST OF THEM SO THE IDEA THAT THERE'S ANOTHER RESIDENTS OR PLACE FOR THEM TO GO. ISRAEL SO WHEN YOU TAKE AWAY THE RIGHT TO VOTE TAKEAWAY MANY THINGS THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE. THANK YOU. SHERRI HARLOW SACRAMENTO COUNTY ALSO AXLE BOARD MEMBER AND I OPPOSE THIS BILL THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING ON MY NAME IS ARE UX GRILLING COME FROM WOODLAND HILLS CALIFORNIA ON OPPOSED BY OPPOSE THIS BILL THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MICHAEL ESCOBAR SACRAMENTO COUNTY. AND. I'M ALSO REGISTRANT. AND. I KNOW PEOPLE AT THE HOSPITAL AND. YEAH I OPPOSE THE BILL. THANK YOU. ROGER HUNNICUTT BUSINESSMEN FROM MODESTO STRONGLY OPPOSE THIS BILL AS AN AMERICAN TAXATION WITHOUT REPRESENTATION THANK YOU. ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NINE OPENS HIS ME SIR. PERFECTLY ALRIGHT. MY NAME IS HOWARD BROKE I. SACRAMENTO I'M ALSO A REGISTRANT AND I OPPOSE THIS BILL THANK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND I'D LIKE TO BRING A BEVERAGE DOT COLLEGE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS ABOUT YOUR HARBOR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH HAVE MISTER CHAIRMAN I ALSO WANT TO EXPRESS THEIR APPRECIATE BEING ABLE TALK A BRIEF YOU WITH THE A CHAIR AS WELL AS. SOME OF THE ADVOCATE SUFFERING COALINGA. BUT OF COURSE WANT TO MAKE A SOME OF THOSE POINTS ON RECORD I HEAR IN THE PUBLIC FORUM. AYE IS WELL I IN I DO THINK THAT THERE ARE SOME A POTENTIAL ALTERNATIVE SIDE TO WHAT TO THIS AS A AS A BILL. BOB OF ONE OF THE ISSUES SIDE THAT I THINK AS BEEN BROUGHT UP AND SHOULD BE A KIND OF FLUSHABLE BIT. LIES THAT ACCORDING TO THE STATE HOSPITALS AYE ONE THOUSAND FIFTY EIGHT OF THE SEXUALLY VIOLENT PREDATORS I HAVE BEEN COMMITTED TO CALLING A STATE HOSPITAL SINCE TWO THOUSAND SIX. UP BUT ONLY TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY OR TWENTY PERCENT HAVE BEEN RELEASED SORT APPEARS THAT A VAST MAJORITY THESE PERSONS WILL LIVE AT THE HOSPITAL FOR A LONG TIME. AND PROBABLY FOR THE REST THEIR LIVES I THINK OF WHERE THE TESTIMONIES WASN'T UP TO NINETY FIVE PERCENT OF THE FOLKS OUT MAYBE A FIT INTO THIS CATEGORY. AYE SO THE QUESTION I WOULD POSE IS OUT WHY SHOULD THEY BE REQUIRED TO VOTE IN A PRECINCT IN WHICH THEY NO LONGER LIVE. I AND THEY ARE HIGHLY UNLIKELY TO RETURN. I BELIEVE THAT THIS MEASURE IS CONSISTENT WITH AN ACTION THAT THIS COMMITTEE ITSELF TOOK JUST LAST MONTH. WHEN IT PASSED AB TWENTY ONE SEVENTY TWO WHICH IS NOW CLEARED THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR AS WELL. WHICH REQUIRES THE CDC ARE TO PROVIDE INFORMATION TO THE CITIZENS REDISTRICTING COMMISSION REGARDING THE LAST KNOWN PLACE OF ADDRESS OF EACH IN INMATE WHO WAS IN A FACILITY THAT IS UNDER THE CDC OURS CONTROL. SO THAT THE INMATES CAN BE COUNTED IN THE COMMUNITY THAT THEY CAME FROM. IF THEY'RE COUNTED FOR THE PURPOSES OF DECIDING WHO THEIR ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES ARE. I BELIEVE THAT THEY CAN VOTE IN THAT SAME DOMICILE. IF WE AS A STATE IN THIS COMMITTEE HAS TAKEN THAT ACTION I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS CONSISTENT. WITH THAT PREVIOUS MEASURE. AND I APPRECIATE OTHER POINTS ON THAT AND THAT'S PART OF WHY IT ACTUALLY ARGUED IN OPPOSITION TO THAT PARTICULAR BILL EVEN THOUGH I RECOGNIZE THAT IT PASSED. BUT SPECIFICALLY IN THIS SITUATION. VOTERS IN THE CALLING A STATE HOSPITAL ARE DIRECTLY AFFECTED BY LOCAL SALES TAXES ARE WHEN THEY BUY GOODS IN THE HOSPITAL IS TESTIFIED HERE IN THE CONVENIENCE STORE THE RESTAURANT. BY THE COPY CENTER AYE IN OTHER BUSINESSES UP WHY SHOULDN'T THEY BE ABLE TO VOTE ON A TAX MEASURE THAT DIRECTLY AFFECTS HOW MUCH THEY PAY ON THOSE GOODS. WILL I I ACTUALLY ONE OF REFERENCE IF I CAN THE CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS TESTIMONY I THOUGHT IT WAS. POWERFUL THAT FROM OUR SERVICE MEMBERS ARE NOT US AFFORDED THE SAME OPPORTUNITY. THAT THEY MAY HAVE BEEN HOUSED IN A COMMUNITY THAT PASSED A SALES TAX MEASURE THAT THEY COULD NOT VOTE ON. BUT THEY THEMSELVES WILL ALSO HAVE TO PAY FOR THAT TAX. SO I WOULD ALIGN MY COMMENTS IN RESPONSE TO THAT QUESTION TO THE CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS COMMENTS. AND I RESPECTFULLY SEE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THOSE IN THAT SOMEONE WHO SERVES ON A MILITARY BASE AYE IS IN A MUCH MORE TEMPORARY SITUATION WHERE IS I THINK THAT. IN THIS SITUATION AYE THE TESTIMONY AND THE. THE BACKGROUND HIS. I TESTED THAT FOLKS ONCE THEY'RE LIVING HERE TEN TEN TO LIVE HERE WITHIN MABILLE ALLOW ME ONE CHARTER STEP BECAUSE. THE MAYOR'S. POINT SHOULDN'T BE LOST THAT. WE HAVE A CITY IN MY COUNTY THAT REALLY HAS DONE EVERYTHING THAT THE STATE HAS ASKED OF. THAT IS ATTEMPTING TO. WHILE WE HAVE MANY NIMBY ISMS NOT IN MY BACKYARD WE HAD A CITY THAT WAS WILLING. AND HAS HOUSED A STATE HOSPITAL IN OUR COMMUNITY. BUT THIS IS A CITY THAT IS STRUGGLING RIGHT NOW OUR HOSPITAL CLOSED THIS WEEK. AND WERE STRUGGLING AS A CITY TO RETAIN THE POLICE OFFICERS AND FIREFIGHTERS THAT ARE NEEDED. FOR OUR COMMUNITY TO THRIVE AND WERE TRYING TO FIND SOLUTIONS AND. REALLY WOULD ASK THAT THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE LOOK AT THE FACT THAT THIS IS A DISTRICT BILL. ONE THAT WILL AFFECT. BUT MEMBERS FROM MY COMMUNITY AND. AS THEIR ADVOCATE I'M TRYING TO FIGHT FOR. THE ALL MEMBERS OF MY COMMUNITY AND I BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL HELPS US TO DO THAT. IN AND I DO APPRECIATE THAT ONE THING AYE I WAS JUST REMINDED OF THAT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TWO WHY BE DISTINCT ABOUT. AYE IS OF ON A MILITARY BASE SIDE. PERHAPS FOR THE REASONS WHY P. X. AND OTHER LOCATIONS ARE SO POPULAR IS BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE SALES TAX WHEN THEY'RE ON THAT FEDERAL FEDERAL MILITARY BASE. BOB BUT I THINK ANOTHER POINT I'D THAT WAS BROUGHT UP AYE IS VERY. WORTH EXPLORING I IN TERMS OF POTENTIALLY THE. THE OVERALL APPROACH TO THIS ISSUE AND THAT'S THAT TWENTY YEARS AGO THE LEGISLATURE ACTUALLY WAS ASKED TO PASS A BILL. A TO GRANT THE CITY COALINGA SPECIAL PERMISSION. ANNEX IN NONCONTIGUOUS PARCEL OF LAND THAT INCLUDED THE STATE PRISON AYE EVEN THOUGH IT WAS FOUR MILES AWAY. IN ORDER TO PERHAPS BOOST OUR THE POPULATION COUNT FOR THE CITY. AND THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR ANALYSIS UP FOR THAT BILL EXPLAIN. EITHER A PORTION OF BOTH THE VEHICLE LICENSE FUND FEES AND THE VEHICLE FUEL TAXES ARE ALLOCATED TO CITIES ON A PER CAPITA BASIS. AND BY ANNEXING STATE CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES AND THEREBY BRINGING PRISON RESIDENTS UNDER THE UMBRELLA OF THE CITY'S LOCAL POPULATION. THE CITY WOULD BE ENTITLED TO A LARGER PORTION OF THESE SUBVENTION. AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I WAS VERY INVOLVED IN WHEN I WORKED OU FOR THE COUNTY OF ORANGE AND SAW HOW. ORANGE COUNTY PUBLIC WORKS BENEFITTED FROM. THE POPULATION NOW THAT THEY HAD AND HOW INDIVIDUAL CITIES BENEFITTED FROM THE BAR POPULATION THEY HAD SU COALINGA. HAS BENEFITED FINANCIALLY FOR LAST TWENTY YEARS FROM BEING ABLE TO COUNT PRISONERS AT THE PLEASANT VALLEY STATE PRISON. AND PATIENTS FROM THE COALINGA STATE A STATE HOSPITAL IN THEIR POPULATION COUNT. HAVING RECEIVED THE FINANCIAL BENEFITS OF COUNTING VOTERS AT THE HOT. WHY SHOULD THE CITY NOW BE ALLOWED TO TREAT THEM AS NON RESIDENTS WITHOUT VOTING RIGHTS AYE IN TAKE THEM OFF THE VOTER ROLLS AND TRANSFORM TO OTHER LOCATIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE? I JUST BECAUSE OF POLITICAL LEADERSHIP BUT DOES NOT LIKE HOW THEY VOTED ON A MEASURE. WELL THINK THAT'S AN APPROPRIATE QUESTION BOMBS. IF WE'RE LOOKING AT A TIME LINE THOUGH I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE STATE HOSPITAL WAS NOT PRESENT WHEN THAT ANNEXATION HAPPENED. AND SO NOR WORD THE VOTING RIGHTS RESTORED UNTIL THE SUPERIOR COURT HAD RESTORED THEM IN TWENTY FOURTEEN. SO WE HAVE TWO VARIABLES THAT HAVE CHANGED SINCE THAT ANNEXATION. THE SECOND AND MORE PRESSING CONCERN IN TERMS OF THE CITY WAS STARING WITH THEIR FINANCIAL SHORTFALLS. HOW DO WE ADDRESS THE ISSUE THAT'S BEFORE US AND THEY WERE TRYING TO DEAL WITH THIS? NOW WHETHER THE CITY SHOULD ON AN AXE ISN'T DECISION THAT THE LOCALS CAN MAKE. WHAT? I WANT TO SAY IS THAT NONE OF THAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IN THE TIMELINE THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO KEEP THE POLICE OFFICERS AND FIREFIGHTERS. THAT WERE NEEDED FOR THE CITY THAT THE TIMELINE FOR THE ON ANNEXATION IF THAT WAS A CHOICE THEY WISH TO PURSUE. A WOULD NOT HAVE ALLOWED THEM TO RETAIN THOSE OFFICERS. AND. MISTER MERITED YOUR I ABSOLUTELY DID I'M I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT. YOU CAN LOOK AT THINGS AS BENEFITS. BUT LET'S TALK ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF PUBLIC SAFETY THAT'S REQUIRED WHEN YOU HAVE A STATE HOSPITAL AND YOU HAVE THE RELATIVES GUY COMING YOU HAVE A PRISON. AND YOU HAVE THE RELATIVES COMING AND A LOT OF OUR COMMUNITY STATED. WE DIDN'T WANT THE EITHER OF THESE INSTITUTIONS COMING BECAUSE OF THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES THAT COME. I JUST CHECK WE GET ABOUT TWELVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR FROM THOSE GOT GAS TAXES AND STUFF LIKE THAT TO COME THROUGH THERE. UP I WOULD GIVE THAT MONEY UP IN A HEARTBEAT EVEN THOUGH THAT WERE NOT TOM. THIS MY PERSONAL OPINION EVEN THOUGH THAT WE ARE ARE HORRIBLE POSITION TECH DEBT WISE BUT IF IT'S THE RECOMMENDATION OF THIS COMMITTEE TO ARM. YOU KNOW DE ANNEX THAT AREA. I WOULD SAY THAT THAT'S AKIN TO GERRYMANDERING ON OUR SIDE IF WE WERE TO DO THAT WE WOULD BE IN THE EXACT SAME BOAT YOU DO LOOK AT US AND SAYING SAYING. HEY WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO CUT THESE PEOPLE OUT SO WE'RE NOT GONNA BUILD A WIN FOR LOSING. AND AND HERE'S ANOTHER THING THAT OUT BUT I WOULD STATE ABOUT. THE STATE HOSPITAL BEING OUT THERE IS THAT AS YOU EVERYONE'S HAS STATED ALREADY YOU KNOW WE TOOK THAT SONG HALF OF OUR CITIZENS I BELIEVE DIDN'T WANT THAT SCENARIO. UP THE STATE HOSPITAL GETS A TON OF ITS WATER ALL OF ITS WATER FROM CITY KALANGA WHAT HAPPENS IF THEY'RE NO LONGER IN THE CITY. WHERE THEY GET THEIR WATER RINSE WHEN THE WHEN THE STATE COMES AND SAYS HEY WE NEED TO CUT OUT WATER FUNDS WE NEED TO TAKE OUT THE DAY REFERRED TO DROUGHT? YOU KNOW THAT ARE OUTLINED BUSINESSES IN AREAS WERE THE FIRST PEOPLE THAT WERE CUT OFF WHERE THEY'RE GONNA GET THEIR WATER FROM. THAT'S GONNA BE ANOTHER BIG SCENARIO I THINK THE CITY AND THE CITIZENS WOULD DEFINITELY BE INTO DE ANNEXING THAT AREA A LISTENING TO OUR CITIZENS AROUND THAT WOULD BE THAT COULD BE AN OPTION HOWEVER. I THINK THAT. WE WOULD LIKE YOU KNOW SOME KIND OF A DIRECTION TO DO THAT BECAUSE OF THAT WAS GIVEN TO US. THEN IT WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO COME BACK AROUND AND SAY THAT WE'RE GERRYMANDERING THE SITUATION AND I THINK THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT PATIENTS THAT ARE OUT THERE ACTUALLY DO BENEFIT. FROM THE SERVICES THAT WE PROVIDE THAT WE'RE NO LONGER GOING TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE. BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT OUR TAX IS SPELLED IN BECAUSE OF THE TAX THAT THE FACT THAT THE STATE DECIDED NOT TO. DO AT THE HOSPITAL ANYMORE OUR CITIZENS BILL LIKE THAT WE'RE BOONDOGGLE AND US THEY SAID THEY WOULD HIRE SIXTY PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE THERE'S ABOUT THIRTY PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE. THEY SAID THE PEOPLE COME TO LIVE HERE VAN POOLS BY TAX BONDS ARE TAKING PEOPLE AWAY FROM OUR COMMUNITY. THIS IS NOT BEEN A BENEFIT TO OUR COMMUNITY I JUST ONE POINT THAT OUT I DON'T WANT ANYONE THINKING OF THIS A BENEFIT THIS IS NOT A BENEFIT EXCEPT FOR THE JOBS. AND THE OPPORTUNITIES FROM THAT BUT GETS WET WHEN THIRTY PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE ARE ONLY WORKING LOCAL AND THE REMAINDER OF THEM ARE WORKING ELSEWHERE. THAT'S NOT SUCH A BIG BENEFIT AND I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT EVERYONE THAT WORKS THERE PAYS THAT SALES TAX EVERYONE THAT COMES THROUGH KALANGA PAYS THAT SELLS TAX. SO IT'S NOT TAXATION WITHOUT REPRESENTATION AND A LOT OF THESE PEOPLE THAT WERE OUT THERE ACTUALLY THERE WERE THERE IN LIEU. OF A SENTENCE THING I LIKE THAT THEY ACTUALLY FINISH THEIR STUFF SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SO MISS CHAIRED THAT THE LAST THING THAT I WANTED TO TO MENTION. I DON'T THINK THE COMMITTEE WOULD REALLY BE IN A POSITION TO MAKE YOU A SUGGESTION SUGGESTIONS ARE DIRECTIONS BUT I CAN MAKE. SUGGESTIONS ONE IS ARE THIS ELECTION THAT'S IN CONCERN WAS A SPECIAL ELECTION IN AN ODD YEAR. I OBVIOUSLY HAD VERY LOW TURNOUT EXCEPT FOR ONE PARTICULAR COMMUNITY THAT SEEM TO HAVE OVER FIFTY FIVE PERCENT TURNOUT WHICH WAS THE FOLKS AT THE STATE HOSPITAL. I STILL HOLDING THE ELECTION AGAIN IN PERHAPS A REGULAR GENERAL ELECTION OR REGULAR PRIMARY ELECTION. WOULD ACTUALLY HAVE A BROADER RANGE OF PARTICIPATION BY THE PEOPLE OF CALLING AND I THINK THAT THAT PROBABLY OUGHT TO BE. THE FIRST PATH I'VE FOR THE CITY TO LOOK AT IT COULD HAVE BEEN JUNE FIFTH BUT THEY WERE TOO LATE FOR THE DEADLINES ON THAT BUT OF COURSE NOVEMBER SIX IS AN OPPORTUNITY. I THEIR QUESTIONS WERE BROUGHT UP IN TERMS OF. THE LAW ON THE DOMICILE QUESTION I IN WHAT REALLY CONSTITUTES ADONIS OUT THAT SOUNDS LIKE A QUESTION FOR THE COURTS AND THE QUESTION I FOR POTENTIAL LITIGATION BY THE CITY. OUGHT TO SETTLE THAT ISSUE WHICH WOULDN'T NEED ACTION BY BY THE STATE LEGISLATURE I NO WOULDN'T BE POPULAR WITH THE MAJORITY. WITHIN THIS BODY BUT MAYBE HAVING A DISCUSSION OF. IS IT APPROPRIATE TO HAVE A VOTING RIGHTS FOR. FELONS. WHO ARE SEXUALLY VIOLENT PREDATORS EVEN AFTER THEIR? THEIR SENTENCES AYE IS A TIME FOR THAT KIND OF DISCUSSION BUT I THINK THAT ALSO ONE OF THINGS THAT WAS BROUGHT UP AND I'M GLAD PEOPLE ARE ACT BY DISCUSSING THIS. IS IS IT APPROPRIATE. TO MOVE FORWARD WITH A DOZEN CORPORATION IF INDEED. THIS FACILITY ISN'T PART OF THE COMMUNITY I I WOULD. AGREE THAT. YOU YOU STILL HAVE A SITUATION OF IT'S NOT A PART OF THE CITY COALINGA IT'S A PART OF THE COUNTY THEY STILL BE REPRESENTED BY COUNTY SUPERVISORS SIX ATRA. IN TERMS OF THEIR LOCAL GOVERNMENT ESPECIALLY SINCE THIS PARCEL AYE IS NOT CONTIGUOUS OUT WITH THE REST OF THE CITY OF. OF COALINGA SO WITH THAT I THINK THAT THERE ARE OTHER POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS AND POTENTIAL AVENUES TO BE ABLE TO WERE. I TO ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS BUT I DO APPRECIATE THEM AND I. AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THE STRUGGLE THE COMMUNITY IS HAVING AND SO I I WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THOSE WHO ARE ADVOCATES FOR THIS BILL UNDERSTAND THAT. THAT I DO UNDERSTAND THAT GIVEN WHAT ONE SECOND SIR. THANK YOU VICE ARBOR ON IT DO YOU CAN MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A CHANCE FOR APPLYING A SECOND BUT I KNOW WE OUGHT TO BE AT THE REPLACE THAT ONCE A MISTER CALDERON. THAT THINK YOU I'LL BE VERY QUICK. IT YOU KNOW I I STRUGGLE BECAUSE I I HAVE TO TWO SIDES OF THIS MONTH THE FOR SIDE IS I KNOW WHO YOU ARE ASSEMBLY MEMBER ARAMBULA I KNOW YOUR HEART I KNOW YOU'RE A GOOD PERSON. AND I KNOW THAT YOU ARE FIGHTING FOR YOUR COMMUNITY AND I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO HAVE A DISTRICT. BECAUSE I BROUGHT BILLS UP HERE WITH. THAT WERE IMPORTANT TO ME AND NOBODY ELSE BECAUSE IT ONLY AFFECTED MY DISTRICT AND I KNOW WHAT THAT'S LIKE. ARE THE OTHER THING IS IS THAT I DO KNOW. A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT BECAUSE I'VE SEEN HOSPITAL MY DESERVE METROPOLITAN. AND SO PART OF THE THING THAT I DO STRUGGLE WITH HIS IS THAT I WILL NOT A SITUATION WHERE THE STATE HOSPITAL HAS SWAYED IN THE ELECTION AND IN THE CITY OF NORWALK. OUT IT'S PRETTY LARGE CITY. AND YOU KNOW. I THINK. THESE PEOPLE ARE DIRECTLY AFFECTED WITH THE DECISIONS THAT ARE BEING MADE IN THIS CITY AND WE HAVE A LOT OF CLOSE ELECTIONS OF TIME IN THE CITY OF LAWYERS FOR GOOD EXAMPLE WE NEED A NEW LIBRARY. AND WAS A REPUBLICAN HOUSE MEMBERS AND THE OF WHAT IT ACTUALLY PUT THIS UP. SOMETHING THAT ARE WAS DIFFICULT FOR THEM BUT YET. A LOT OF THE REPUBLICAN. ELECTORATE THAT DID SHOW UP TO VOTE VOTED AGAINST IT AND END UP LOSING OUR BOND AND ORDERED IT TO BUILD A NEW LIBRARY IT'S A LOT OF TIMES WE HAVE A LOT OF CLOSE ELECTIONS. AND. I I I STRUGGLE WITH IS IT FAIR TO PLACE IT SPECIFICALLY ON THIS HOSPITAL THE INMATES AT THIS HOUR OR THE INDIVIDUALS AT THIS HOSPITAL AS BEING THE ONES RESPONSIBLE FOR SWING THE ELECTION WHEN CLEARLY. IT WAS AN ISSUE OF GETTING MORE PEOPLE OUT IN MORE PEOPLE TO VOTE AND IN SUPPORT OF THE MEASURE. AND YOU KNOW IF IT IF THE CITY IS IN SUCH DIRE NEED OF OF THESE RESOURCES. WHY WHAT WHY I SO WHY WASN'T IT ARTICULATED OR OR OR PROPERLY EXPLAINED TO THE ELECTORATE THAT WAS VOTING TO PLEASE SHOW UP PLEASE VOTE BECAUSE WE ARE IN A DIRE SITUATION WE ARE IN A DIRE POSITION? WE DO NEED THIS TAX INCREASE TO GET MORE PEOPLE IN SUPPORT ARE BECAUSE I KNOW COMMUNITIES REGARDLESS OF PARTY REPRESENTATION THEY THEY THEY DO TELL UP AND. THINGS IF THEY TRULY KNOW THAT THERE'S A PROBLEM THAT THAT AND THAT THERE'S JUST A STRUGGLE THAT A PARTICULAR COMMUNITIES HAVING SO THAT'S WHY REALLY STRUGGLE WITH THIS BILL. UP I WANNA I WANNA GIVE YOU AN OPPORTUNITY TO CAN IT CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS ISSUE I'M MORE THAN HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU ON THIS ISSUE BECAUSE I DO HAVE A MAJOR STATE HOSPITAL. IN MY DISTRICT. BUT I JUST WANT REGISTER THIS TWO CENTS A DIFFERENT APPROPRIATIONS IS ABOUT THE MISTER COMMITTEE BUT I DO THINK YOU FOR WORKING ON BEHALF YOUR COMMUNITY. THANK YOU. AND IF I. MAY I. I WOULD AGREE IN ITS HARD HAVING THEM MAYOR RIGHT HERE BUT THE CITY MAYBE SHOULD HAVE RUN A BETTER CAMPAIGN. I DON'T THINK THEY UNDERSTOOD THAT VOTING RIGHTS HAVE BEEN RESTORED. WHEN THE MEASURE WAS PUT BEFORE THE VOTERS. AND. I ALSO FIVE. CAN JUST. THE TIMING WAS OF UTMOST IMPORTANCE. THEY WERE REALLY TRYING TO. THANK YOU. TIMING NEEDED TO HAPPEN BEFORE THE OFFICERS WERE REMOVED. AND THAT WAS REALLY THE REASON FOR THE SPECIAL ELECTION THAT WASN'T THAT THAT WAS THE IDEAL TIME FOR US TO HAV THAT CONVERSATION IT WAS. THE ONLY TIME. THAT WE COULD HAVE THAT THIS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. PARIS PLEASE ARTISTS WOULD JUST LIKE TO ADD THAT TIME IN OUR TWO THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN ELECTION WHERE WE DID HAVE THAT THE TAX WE HAD DOWN. I THINK EIGHTEEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY TWO VOTERS AND IN THE OFF YEAR WHERE THE ONLY THING ON THERE WAS THIS WE HAD ELEVEN HUNDRED AND TWENTY SEVEN. SO I'D SAY WE DID A PRETTY GOOD JOB OF GETTING OUT THERE TO OUR VOTERS AND OFF YOUR WHERE WE ONLY HAD THIS ONE ISSUE. BUT WE'RE DISENFRANCHISED POPULATION WE HAVE A LARGE HISPANIC POPULATION IT DOESN'T VOTE WE HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE THERE THAT DON'T VOTE IT'S VERY HARD TO GET TO THESE COMMUNITIES AND TO GET THEM TO VOTE. ESPECIALLY WHEN THE CITY IS CANNOT SPEND CITY MONEY TO ACTUALLY PROMOTE THAT'S ALL WE CAN DO IS GIVE INFORMATION OUT SITES ON THAT AMOUNT WE DID TRY WE CAN WE WILL CONTINUE TO TRY AND I THANK YOU GUYS FOR LISTENING TO ME. THANK YOU. ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. MISTER MARLAND. FAMOUS CHAIR IN. THANK MY SEAT MATE NAM FOR HIS EFFORTS HERE AND I GENERALLY. IN INCLINED TO GIVE DEFERENCE. ON DISTRICT BILLS BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL SORTS OF LOCAL DYNAMICS THAT YOU ARE LIVING AND BREATHING THAT WE ARE. ON THIS DAY IS TRYING TO CATCH UP WITH. AYE I'M STRUGGLING WITH THE BILL. THE. THE KEY QUESTION FOR ME BEYOND THE LOCAL DYNAMICS IS THAT ONE OF. A DOMICILE AND I'M SORRY THAT I CAME INTO THE CONVERSATION A LITTLE LATE HERE. THE CONCERN I HAVE IS AROUND. THE POTENTIAL FOR DISCERN FOR LOCATE. OF THE THE PREVIOUS COMMUNITY. OF ORIGIN. IF THERE ARE. UNIQUE SITUATIONS WHERE YOU CAN'T POSITIVELY IDENTIFY. WHERE ASSEMBLY ORIGINATED WHERE THEY SORT OF HAD? THE MOST. CONNECTION. IN A COMMUNITY. OF PRIOR THE HARM RESIDENTS. SO. WHILE I DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE A FUNDAMENTAL CONCERN AROUND. DID THAT DAD VOTING RIGHTS QUESTION ABOUT CITY OF ORIGIN I'M JUST CONCERNED ABOUT THE NEGATIVE BY PRODUCTS. OF SOMEBODY WHO. IS ON THE VOTER ROLLS RIGHT NOW. THAT BECAUSE OF THEIR UNIQUE SITUATION ARE NO LONGER ABLE TO VOTE. SO I JUST WOULD ASK THAT IF THE BILL MOVES FORWARD THAT AND I'M CERTAINLY MORE THAN HAPPY TO TO WORK WITH YOU ON KIND OF. THE THAT DIABLO UNTANGLING THAT. QUESTION A LITTLE BIT. I WOULD JUST ASK THAT DEBT YOU LOOK AT THAT BECAUSE. I AM NOT COMFORTABLE VOTING FOR SOMETHING THAT HAS. THE LIKELIHOOD OF DISENFRANCHISED. PEOPLE FROM THE VOTING ROLLS. OKAY. IT'S NOT. SO MUCH THE THE PRIMARY ISSUE OF WHERE THEY VOTE IT'S THAT ULTIMATE RESULT OF SOMEBODY NOW NOT BEING ABLE TO WAY AND. ON. MAJOR ISSUES CELL. I JUST ASK THAT YOU. SHOULD THE BILL MORE FOR TODAY. LOOK AT THE POTENTIAL BYPRODUCTS OF WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE. IF I MAY I. WE WORK QUITE INTENTIONAL WITHIN THE BILL NOT TO TRY TO REMOVE ANYONE'S VOTING RIGHTS. ALL WE WERE TRYING TO DO IS HAVE THE LAST KNOWN ADDRESS. THE LAST KNOWN ONE. BE WHAT WE CONSIDER AS THEIR DOMICILE. AND. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO REALIZE THAT THOSE WHO ARE RELEASED. DON'T GET RELEASED AND TO COALINGA OR TO FRESNO COUNTY THEY GET RELEASED INTO THEIR LAST KNOWN ADDRESS. TO THEIR COUNTY OF DOMICILE. IF WE CONSIDER AND. THE PLACE AND PUT THEM IN THOSE FORMER PLACES WHY DO NOT ALLOW THEM TO VOTE. IN THE HOMES AND COMMUNITIES THAT THEY KNOW BETTER. THEY'VE NEVER TOUCHED FOOT IN CALLING UP BEFORE THEY WERE PLACED AT THE STATE HOSPITAL. I. I STRUGGLED TO TRYING TO COME UP WITH THE SOLUTION AND REALLY HAVE COME TO THE COMMITTEE WITH AN OPEN MIND. TO TRY TO WORK WITH YOU AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO STRENGTH IN THIS BILL IF IT IS ALLOWED TO CONTINUE PASSED TODAY. THANK YOU DOCTOR WEBER HIT SO I'D. SORRY I WAS STUCK IN ANOTHER COMMITTEE AND JUST GOT OUT TO COMPETE FOR THIS ITEM. I TO LIKE EVERYONE ELSE STRUGGLES WITH THIS ITEM WITH THIS ISSUE. UP PRIMARILY BECAUSE I'M YOU KNOW I MEAN I I UNDERSTAND WHAT WE GET REDISTRICTING AND THAT WAS REALLY A STEP SNAP IN TIME. BUT PROBABLY PEOPLE CHANGE SEVERE. SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO VOTE. WHEREVER THEY CHOOSE TO VOTE MOST OF THE TIME. A I'M CEMENT MOST OF US HAVE HAD KIDS WHO GOT OFF TO COLLEGE. AND THE SIDE THAT THEY GONNA KEEP THEIR VOTING AT THEIR PARENTS HOUSE. VERSUS WHETHER CURRENTLY LIVING. OF THE MAY CHANGE EVENTUALLY AND SO WE'VE NEVER HAD THIS. THIS HIGH IDEA THAT YOU KNOW YOU CAN BE EASILY DISENFRANCHISED ESPECIALLY POPULATION WE WERE TALKING ABOUT A VERY SPECIALIZED PEOPLE THAT WE. THAT WE CAN ALMOST GERRYMANDER OUT OF A SITUATION BECAUSE WE DIDN'T LIKE THE OUTCOME OF THE VOTE. AND I THINK MANY OF US HAVE HAD COMMUNITIES ARE ISSUES THAT HAVE COME FORWARD THAT WE DIDN'T REALLY. LIKE THE OUTCOME. OF BUT WE DIDN'T THINK ABOUT. DISENFRANCHISED IN THOSE FOLKS IN THAT COMMUNITY FROM BEING A PART OF THE POT THAT'S THERE WE JUST FIGURED WE HAD TO WORK HARDER. TO GET OTHER FOLKS AFTER VOTE ARE REGISTERED MORE PEOPLE OR WHATEVER MAY BE AND I KNOW YOU'VE GOT A UNIQUE SITUATION. THERE BUT IT SAME. YOUR CITY. M. X. THESE FOLKS AREN'T INCREASES POPULATION YOU KNOW FOR OTHER REASONS AND NOW YOU KNOW WITH THAT COMES. THE GOOD THE BAD AND UGLY AND ALL IN BETWEEN I MEAN WHEN YOU'RE REALLY DOING SOMETHING LIKE THAT. SO I I CAN'T REALLY SUPPORT. IT BECAUSE IT SEEMS SO MUCH LIKE GERRYMANDERING FOR ONE REASON ONLY AND ARE A POPULATION AND HOSPITAL AND WE'RE GONNA. BASICALLY DISENFRANCHISE ARE REQUIRE THEM TO VOTE US SOMEWHERE ELSE OR YOU KNOW DO NOT ALLOW THEM TO REGISTER TO VOTE IN THAT CITY. UNLESS YOU'VE WE'VE EVER DONE THAT BEFORE IN TERMS OF NOT ALLOWING A PERSON TO REGISTER TO VOTE. OF AND TO EXERCISE THAT RIGHT TO VOTEIN THAT PARTICULAR COMMUNITY SO. I DON'T OF IT SETS A GOOD PRECEDENT BAD PRECEDENT FOR THAT TO HAPPEN. I ED AND I THINK I THINK OF MISTER HARPER FOR GIVING YOU SOME SUGGESTIONS BECAUSE THOSE ARE. VERY GOOD LEGAL SUGGESTIONS ABOUT WHAT COULD HAPPEN IF YOU. YOU THINK THIS IS YOU KNOW THIS IS NOT THE NATURE OF THE CITY AND THAT THE THE ANNEXING OF THAT GROUP WAS NOT. OUR HAS NOT BEEN BENEFICIAL YOU KNOW OF. WHERE YOU WOULD PUT THEM IN THOSE KIND OF THINGS IS ANOTHER WHOLE WHOLE WHOLE LOT SITUATION BUT? I THINK IT'S KINDA DANGEROUS TO KIND OF WAIT INTO THIS GERRYMANDERING OF SITUATION. BECAUSE OF. THE OUTCOME OF THE VOTE. THANK YOU. ANY ADDITIONAL YES SIR PLEASE. I WAS. THERE WHEN WE. WE DID ANNEX THAT. STATE HOSPITAL IN AND THE PRESENT OR NOT PRESENT BUT AT THE STATE HOSPITAL. AND THAT. I REMEMBER THAT AT. WHEN THE PEOPLE AT THE HOSPITAL WERE BUYING THINGS. THEY WORK THEY WORK PAYING A LOCAL TAX. THEY WERE THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO PAY THE LOCAL TAX I DON'T KNOW WHY FOR FOR THAT REASON THEY DID BUT LATER ON IN THE YEARS THAT. IT FOLLOWED THEN THEY HAD TO START PAYMENT I DON'T KNOW IF YOU REMEMBER EXACTLY WHAT DATE IT WAS THAT THEY DIDN'T PAY LOCAL TAXES WHEN WE FIRST. FIRST THERE IT AND I HAVE NO WHO. NO ANSWER WHY. BUT I'M. IT DOES AFFECT. A LOT OF STUFF. WITH ART. THIS COUNCIL WAS GOOD. YOU'RE HERE MARK THAT MONEY FOR AT EMI STAFF. AND THEM WITH OUR HOSPITAL CLOSING THAT MEANS OUR AMBULANCE WE HAVE TWO AMBULANCES AND THE CITY OF KALINGA. AND MOST EVERY DAY THEY'RE GONE BECAUSE WE HAVE A STATE HOSPITAL. AND WE HAVE A. APPROVE THEM THERE. AND. THAT'S THAT'S WHO THEY UTILIZE FIRST THAT THEY USE UP LATE TAKE A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE FROM THE STATE PRISON AND THE STATE OFF OF THE TAKE THE PATIENTS FROM BOTH. AND THEY DIDN'T AT THE NEAREST PLACE OF HAMPERED BUT MOST OF THE TIME THEY TAKEN TO BAKERSFIELD. SO WE'RE. FOUR HOURS AWAY WITH AN AMBULANCE EVERYDAY I MEAN IT OUR ARE GUYS I I YOU I WAS A VOLUNTEER AM WITH GUY. AND I I WORK FOR THE FIRE DEPARTMENT FOR THIRTY EIGHT YEARS OF THE VOLUNTEER AND OF THE MONITOR CAPTAIN. AND I WORKED THERE FOR THIRTY EIGHT YEARS. AND WE'VE WE'VE HAD A LOT OF PEOPLE BUT WE JUST DON'T HAVE THAT MANY PEOPLE ANYMORE. AND WE'VE TRIED WE PUT THE MONEY INTO IT. THAT IT JUST DOESN'T COME BACK AND A LOT OF TIMES WHERE THERE WITH NO AMBULANCE AT ALL. AND THE CLOSEST ONE IS TWENTY MILES AWAY IN AND AVENEL. AND SO IF SOMEBODY GETS HURT HAVE A HEART ATTACK OR SOMETHING WE DON'T EVEN HAVE A HOSPITAL NOW. GO THAT'S WHAT'S HURTING SO BAD. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE FIGHTING THIS. THEY USE THE USER. THINK THANK YOU SAYING NO ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. DOCTORING BILL WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE. I WOULDN'T. I APPRECIATE THE. PLAINTIFF AND TIME THAT THIS COMMITTEE HAS INVESTED INTO THE SUBJECT MATTER AND. MY COLLEAGUES FOR HEARING US OUT. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO REPRESENT OUR COMMUNITIES AND NAM I HEARD AN OUTCRY. FROM MINE ASKING FOR A SOLUTION TO A PROBLEM. AND IT'S THE PROBLEM THAT WE PRESENT TO THE COMMITTEE WITHOUT THINKING THAT WE HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS REVIEW AND ARE WILLING TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE CHAIR IN THIS COMMITTEE AS. IF THIS BILL IS ALLOWED TO MOVE FORWARD. BUT DO YOU JUST WANT TO RESTATE IF I CAN'T. NO WE'RE HERE WE TRYING TO TAKE AWAY SOMEONE'S RIGHT TO VOTE. WE'RE JUST TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE ABLE TO VOTE IN A PLACE WHERE THEY. HAVE MORE TIES TO. THAT THE COMMUNITIES THAT THEY CAME FROM THE HOMES THAT THEY GROW UP AND THEY UNDERSTAND THEIR LOCAL DYNAMICS. FOR US IN OUR LOCAL DYNAMICS. CALLING DOES THE ONLY CITY I HAVE IN MY. DISTRICT THAT'S DECREASING IN SIZE. THEY HAVE HAD A TWENTY FIVE PERCENT REDUCTION IN THEIR POLICE FORCE THEIR HOSPITAL HAS CLOSED DOWN. AND. THEY REALLY AREN'T TO US AS A STATE TO RECOGNIZE THE. COMMITMENTS THAT THEY'VE MADE. TO HOUSE. THIS STATE HOSPITAL AND A PRISON IN THEIR BACKYARDS AND BE AFFECTS AND UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES THAT COME FROM. WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR LIFE. THANK YOU. VERY MUCH DOCTOR ARAMBULA FOR YOUR PRESENTATION TODAY AND THANK YOU FOR EVERYBODY WHO WHO. TESTIFIED ON BOTH SIDES. OF A TOUGH TOUGH ISSUE. AND GOING JUST FOR SAY THAT. OBVIOUSLY DE YEAH I'D I ADMIRE AND RESPECT YEAH YOU'D DOCTOR ARAMBULA AND HOW HARD YOU ADVOCATE. FOR YOUR DISTRICT IN THE RESPECT THAT YOU HAVE AMONGST ALL YOUR COLLEAGUES. WHEN YOU COME WITH WITH TOUGH ISSUES. AND AND I. I TRY <u>&lt;c.green&gt; DEAL WITH ME AND AND&lt;/c&gt;</u> AND MY COMMITTEE STAFF SPENT A LOT OF TIME LOOKING AT THIS ISSUE AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. YOU KNOW WHAT CHANGES COULD BE MADE IT'S A DISTRICT ISSUE. THAT STRIKES AT A FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE. THAT'S A MAKES A HARD IS NOT A DISTRICT ISSUE IN THE SENSE OF. PERMISSION DEB TO THE BILL THE BUILDING SOMEWHERE WHERE YOU SHOULDN'T OR YEAH OR YOU DONT PERMISSION OR SOMETHING LIKE IT'S IT COMES DOWN TO VOTING RIGHTS. AND YOU KNOW OUR PEOPLE WHO. DON YOU KNOW SERVED THEIR TIME OF FOR A CRIME THEY COMMITTED AND THEN ARE ARE RELEASED FROM PRISON BUT ARE HOUSED IN THE STATE. HOSPITAL A WHERE THEY GET THEIR VOTING RIGHTS BACK. YOU KNOW SHOULD WE FORCE THEM TO A VOTE IN A PLACE WHERE THERE MAY NEVER LOVE AGAIN AND AN ODDS ARE WILL NEVER LOVE AGAIN. VERSUS GIVING THEM THAT THE OPTION OF OF REGISTERING TO VOTE WHERE THEY LIVE. AND THEY HAVE THAT OPTION THAT YOU KNOW MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT. WHEN PEOPLE GO TO THE HOSPITAL ON THERE ARE A RELEASED IN THE OF THE VOTING RIGHTS BACK THEY CAN EITHER REGISTER TO VOTE WHERE THEY. CAME FROM OR THEY CAN REGISTER TO VOTE AT THE HOSPITAL AND THAT'S A DECISION THAT. THAT FOLKS MAKE THEIR. I I THINK THAT. SOME GOOD SUGGESTIONS WERE MADE BY VICE CHAIR HARPER AND OTHERS. ON ON POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS UNFORTUNATELY A SOLUTION THAT ON PERSONALLY AND JUST NOT COMFORTABLE WITH. IS THIS IDEA THAT YOU FORCE PEOPLE. ON SAID TO VOTE FROM A PLACE THAT THEY CAME FROM BUT MAY NEVER GO BACK TO AGAIN. AND ODDS ARE YOU WON'T EVER GO BACK TO AGAIN SO I'M GONNA BE LAYING OFF THE BILL BUT I I FULLY. ENCOURAGE MY COLLEAGUES TO VOTE HOWEVER THEY SEE FIT. AND WITH THAT I'M I'M SECRETARY WE PLEASE CALL VOTE. THE MOTION IS TO PASS BERMAN NOT VOTING BERMAN NOT VOTING HARPER. HARPER NO CALDERON.
