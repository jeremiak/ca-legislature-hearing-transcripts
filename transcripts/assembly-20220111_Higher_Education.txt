WE WILL BE HEARING FOR BILLS ON THE AGENDA TODAY THOSE WILL BE TAKEN UP AND FILE ORDER. THE BILLS ARE ON THE AGENDA ARE AB TWO NINE FIVE. AB ELEVEN EIGHTY SEVEN. AB TWELVE THIRTY TWO AND AB FIFTEEN OH FIVE. AT THIS TIME. ASSEMBLY MEMBER JONES SAWYER IF YOU WOULD PLEASE BEGIN YOUR TESTIMONY. ON. EIGHTY TO NINETY FIVE. THANK YOU AND GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS ENOUGH MISTER CHAIR BOB THIS BILL ESTABLISHES A WORKGROUP OF HIGHER EDUCATION REPRESENTATIVES FACULTY STAFF AND STUDENTS TO DEVELOP A PROGRAM TO PROVIDE FREE COLLEGE TO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS. SPECIFICALLY THAT'S WHAT EIGHTY TO NINETY FIVE FREE COLLEGE DOES IN CARRYING OUT THEIR WORK THIS WORKGROUP CAN FOCUS ON DETERMINING WHICH CAMPUSES WOULD BEST FIT TO DEVELOP. PROGRAM MODEL IDENTIFYING IF THERE IS ANY PARTICULAR STUDENTS THAT WOULD BENEFIT FROM THE PROGRAM AND CREATE A MODEL THAT WILL WORK IN TANDEM WITH THE EXISTING FINANCIAL PROGRAMS SUCH AS CAL GRANT. HISTORY OF COST ATTENDANCE OVER FORTY FIVE YEARS HIGHER EDUCATION CALIFORNIA'S WAS PERCEIVED AS A PUBLIC GOOD. STUDENTS WERE NOT CHARGE TUITION BECAUSE THE STATE SOUGHT TO ENSURE THAT THERE WERE AS FEW BARRIERS AS POSSIBLE TO A MORE EDUCATED CALIFORNIANS SOCIETY. THE STATE HAS MOVED IN AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT DIRECTION CONSIDERING CSU TUITION AND FEES HAVE RISEN ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND 60% AND YOU SEE TUITION AND FEES HAVE RISEN FIVE HUNDRED AND 55% SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE. ADDITIONALLY COST OF ATTENDANCE SUCH AS FOOD HOUSING HAVE RISEN 40% SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE. FURTHER ADDING TO THE ADDITIONAL STRESS ON TO PENINSULA STRESSED OF STUDENTS. DURING MY FIRST YEAR AS AN UNDERGRADUATE IN THE SEVENTIES ALONG WITH MR MEDINA. TUITION IN THE UC SYSTEM WITH ABOUT TWO THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY NINE DOLLARS PER YEAR. THIS GENERAL GENERATION SHOULD NOT BE REQUIRED TO PAY NINETEEN TIMES MORE THAN WHAT I PAID BEEN MY PUBLIC SECTOR COUNTERPART WAS REQUIRED TO PAY FOR COMPARABLE EDUCATION. I WENT TO UNIVERSITY SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA DURING THE SEVENTIES WE PAY THIRTY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR WHICH WAS A HUNDRED FORTY EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS- COMMITMENT OVER FOUR YEAR- DURING THAT SAME TIME IN THE SEVENTIES AGAIN. IT WAS TWO THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX DOLLARS PER YEAR NOW BERKELEY IS ABOUT FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN TWENTY TWENTY AND USC IS IT SIXTY THOUSAND UC'S DOUBLE BEARS. AND OBVIOUSLY THE UC SYSTEM IS WAY UP TO A HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND A YEAR AND TWO OVER FOUR YEARS AND TWO AND FORTY THOUSAND. FOR USC. PRESENT DAY INSPIRED A PAST INVESTMENTS EXISTING FINANCIAL AID DOES NOT COVER ALL STUDENTS. AND MANY REMAIN UNABLE TO AFFORD ATTENDANCE AT THE STATE'S PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES. AS THE CSU AND UC SYSTEM HAVE CONTINUED FOR PROSPER PROBE PROPOSED TUITION AND FEE INCREASES AND ACOSTA BASIC NEEDS IN THIS STATE HAVE RISEN EXPONENTIALLY THE STATE MUST CONTINUE INVESTING IN FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FOR STUDENTS. AS A FURTHER EXAMPLE IN RECENT YEARS A CSU STUDENT WITH LOW INCOME WOULD HAVE TO WORK TWENTY TO FIFTY FIVE HOURS A WEEK THE COVERAGE NET COSTS OF THEIR EDUCATION. COLLEGE STUDENTS OFTEN HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN STUDYING OR WORKING TO AFFORD THEIR TUITION AND LIVING EXPENSES. CALIFORNIA SHOULD BE IN THE BUSINESS OF STUDENT SUCCESS AND NOT STUDENT STRESS EXPANDING ACCESS TO. HIGHER EDUCATION IS MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL THE INVESTMENT FOR CALIFORNIA FOR EXAMPLE THE BATCHES DEGREE. INCREASES A PERSON'S EARNING POTENTIAL BY 65% ACCORDING TO THE U. S. BUREAU OF STATISTICS. RICK INCREASES THE OVERALL TAX CONTRIBUTION TO THE STATE. A IN THE LONG TERM FINANCIAL STABILITY FOR ALL. I APPRECIATE QUESTIONS RAISED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS AS WE MOVE FORWARD HOPEFULLY WE MOVE FORWARD I WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH ALL PARTIES I WILL HAVE DISCUSSIONS UNDER RELEVANT ESPECIALLY THE TOP TEN RECOMMENDATIONS AND ENQUIRES THEY WERE BROUGHT UP BY THIS COMMITTEE AND I WANNA THANK THEM FOR THEIR WORK. I WILL HAVE DISCUSSIONS WITH RELEVANT STAKEHOLDERS TO CONTINUE WORKING ON THIS ON THIS ISSUE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. AND I THINK MY WITNESS. COULDN'T COME IN PERSON.

GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS RON RAPP SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA FACULTY ASSOCIATION AND STRONG SUPPORT OF AB TWO NINETY FIVE. I WAS ACTUALLY THE MAIN WITNESS BUT FELT UNCOMFORTABLE COMING INTO COMMITTEES SO IF YOU DON'T MIND I'LL GO HAD READ MY STATEMENT IT'S ABOUT A MINUTE- PLEASE GO AHEAD. OKAY THANK YOU- AB TWO NINETY FIVE BUT YOU KNOW- WILL CREATE A WORKING GROUP TO DEVELOP A PILOT PROGRAM TO PROVIDE FREE COLLEGE FOR CALIFORNIA STUDENTS. MANY OF CALIFORNIA STUDENTS PARTICULARLY THOSE FROM LOW INCOME FAMILIES FIND IT DIFFICULT IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE TO AFFORD TO GO TO COLLEGE. NOT ONLY ARE THESE STUDENTS FINDING IT DIFFICULT TO AFFORD TUITION FEES AND TEXTBOOKS BUT A LARGE PERCENTAGE ALSO REPORT THAT THEY STRUGGLE WITH FOOD INSECURITY AND HOMELESSNESS. CFA BELIEVES THAT AB TWO NINETY FIVE WILL PROVIDE THE LEGISLATURE WITH THE INFORMATION THAT YOU NEED TO DEVELOP A ROADMAP ON HOW WE CAN ACHIEVE TUITION FREE COLLEGE ACROSS THE VARIOUS MODES. OF THE HIGHER EDUCATION COMMUNITY SO THAT CALIFORNIA CAN PROVIDE MORE STUDENTS WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO COMPLETE A COLLEGE EDUCATION IT IS FOR THESE REASONS THAT WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR- VOTE AB TWO NINETY FIVE.

THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER AWFUL OF THE- OPPORTUNITY FOR STUDENTS- TO EARN THEIR BACHELOR'S DEGREE OF- WITH- NO COST. BUT AS YOU KNOW THE MONEY HAS TO COME FROM SOME SOMEWHERE TO BENEFIT FROM THIS OF FREE TUITION FOR THEIR- A POST SECONDARY EDUCATION. LISTENING TO YOUR PROPOSAL- THINKING. IF WE CAN. COME UP WITH A SOME- SERVICE REQUIREMENTS SUCH AS LIKE- WEST POINT- OR MILITARY ACADEMIES. WELL AS FAR AS I KNOW THE L. OR TUITION FREE AND- REMOVED EVERYTHING PROVIDED. BUT UPON GRADUATION THEY ARE REQUIRED TO SERVE. THE COUNTRY. FIVE TO SEVEN SOMETHING YEARS. SO SIMILAR TO THAT. NOT JUST- OFFERING FREE TUITION- NUMBER RETURNED TO THE SOCIETY. I'M GONNA EDUCATE YOU ORGANIZE- FOR OUR CITIZENS WE ARE PAYING FOR YOUR TUITION. AND THE SECONDARY AND OPPORTUNITY MIGHT BE. I KNOW- BUT TYPICALLY- RECENTLY. WE HAVE A COME UP WITH US SO MANY DIFFERENT KINDS OF CLUSTER AND AIDS PROGRAMS. INCLUDING NOT FEDERAL BRAND CYSTIC GRANTS SCHOLARSHIPS AS SUCH. STOP MERIT BASED SCHOLARSHIP OPPORTUNITIES FOR THEM TO- WHAT CAR. RATHER THAN OPENING FOR ANYBODY COME. I MEAN WE ARE LIVING IN THE- DEMOCRATIC CAPITALISTIC SOCIETY WHERE- WE ONLY NEED TO COMPETE AND WHAT CAR. WHEN YOU MAKE IT THAT JUST TO OPEN. THIS SOUNDS LIKE A PROVIDE PROVIDING INCENTIVES ABOUT THE- IT COULD BE UP RIVERSIDE. INCENTIVES NO I CAN WALK INTO THE COLLEGES ANY TIME I WANT THIS OPEN AND FREE AN UNKNOWN KNOWING CENTERS. SO I HAVE DONALD FOR THE TAX MONEY THAT THE WE WILL BE EDUCATING THEM THERE HAS TO BE SOME- INCENTIVES AND THE MOST- QUALIFICATIONS THEIR COMMITMENT WHAT THEY WILL DO FOR THE SOCIETY HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT. BOB AND THANK YOU DOCTOR CHOI OF. THE EVEN GOT THIS IT'S IN IN NINETEEN SIXTY THEN GOVERNOR BROWN- DECIDED THAT IT WOULD MAKE ALL. COLLEGE FREE BUT I DON'T THINK HE UNDERSTOOD THE ULTIMATE IMPACT ON THE ECONOMY WITHIN FROM NINETEEN SIXTY TO SEVENTY NINE- PEOPLE CONSIDER US THE BEST EDUCATED WORK FORCE IN THE WORLD. COMPANIES CAME TO CALIFORNIA AND WE FLOURISHED THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT CAME INTO THE STATE BASED ON A WELL EDUCATED- CALIFORNIANS BENEFITTED US FINANCIALLY AND HELP TO. BE ABLE TO PAY FOR IT A LOT OF THIS AND SO THAT'S WHERE THIS KIND OF IDEA CAME FROM THAT IF WE GO AHEAD AND BETTER EDUCATE EVERYONE. IN ADDITION- I PUT THROUGH A BILL- BEFORE AND I THINK MAYBE BEFORE YOU GOT HERE CALL PAID FOR IT WHERE YOU WOULD GO AHEAD. AND GET YOUR DEGREE BUT THEN LIKE WE COME FROM AN INSTITUTION WHERE PEOPLE MAKE CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE ALUMNI ASSOCIATION OTHERS AND WE COME FROM AN INSTITUTION WHERE THEY RAISED BILLIONS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR A RELATIVELY SMALL GROUP. OF ALUMNI AND GRADUATE WE WOULD THEN NOT TAX BILL WOULD LOOK AT THE BENEFIT SOMEONE NOT MAKING MINIMUM WAGE BUT THE NOW MAKING- WELL OVER MINIMUM WAGE NOW BECAUSE THEY NOW HAVE A DEGREE. LOOK AT THE DELTA IN WHAT THEY PAYING IN TAXES AND THE INCREASE OVER THAT AND THEN MAYBE USE THOSE FUNDS TO DO THAT AND SO WHAT THIS COMMITTEE WOULD DO WE LOOK AT ALL OF THOSE. INCLUDING LOOKING AT PROVIDING MORE DOCTORS. COULD COME AND WORK IN MINORITY AREAS LIKE MINUS LA PROVIDING MORE SOCIAL WORKERS TO GO OUT AND DEAL WITH THEM THE HOMELESS SITUATION OUT THERE SO WE BILL THAT INFRASTRUCTURE. MAY NOT ONLY THE CAN DATA BECAUSE A WORKING SERVICE ANOTHER PLACE. THAT WOULD BE- THAT WOULD HELP. IN THE LONG RUN SO I NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT THEM THE MILITARY EXAMPLE YOU GAVE IN- THAT IS SOMETHING WILL DEFINITELY ON TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU VOICE PLANNING I'M NOT DISPUTING. A THE VALUE OF- EDUCATION OBVIOUSLY EDUCATED PERSON IS A MORE PRODUCTIVE AND OR CONTRIBUTE TO MORE. BUT THE WHEN YOU PROVIDE FREE TUITION. A MAN IN THE COMMUNIST COUNTRY WHATEVER YOU KNOW BUT THE SOMEBODY HAS TO PAY FOR THAT SO- I THOUGHT THOUGH IT WOULD BE MORE INCENTIVIZING AND THE TAXPAYERS SO- RESISTANCE OR DATED LAST SO WHEN WE EXPECT THEM TO RETURN SOMETHING. AND ALL HIGH A BAR THE CONCEPT OF FROM THE MILITARY ACADEMY STUFF THAT THAT THE OPPORTUNITY TO SERVE THE COUNTRY- UPON EDUCATION UPON COMPLETION OF THE PROGRAM SAID SO- THAT WAS SOMEONE IDEA BUT I'M I'M TALKING ABOUT THE- BECAUSE OF THIS WILL BE AN ADULT TAX BURDEN FOR. ALL OUR CITIZENS SO WHO ARE NOT. NECESSARILY BENEFITING FROM THAT WILL BE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THIS KIND OF. SO YEAH THAT'S OF THAT'S SYSTEM THANK YOU OPPENHEIMER A COUPLE BUT- WHAT ABOUT THE- WELL ROUGHLY OUT GAS AND THAN. FIFTY PER OPPOSITE SO SO WHAT TO BAY. THE BURDEN OFF WILL PAY MORE TO.

AND SECONDLY- MY BILL ABA SEVEN OH FIVE WHICH WHICH REFORM FOR MEDIAL EDUCATION PLACES MOST STUDENTS DIRECTLY AND TRANSFER LEVEL CLASSES AND IT IS CRUCIAL THAT THEY HAVE THE TOOL OF REMEDIAL EDUCATION AVAILABLE TO THEM AND IT DOES NOT- REPLACE OTHER FORMS OF CO REQUISITE FOR CONCURRENT SUPPORTS WITH ME TODAY HERE IN SUPPORT IS DAVID O'BRIEN VICE CHANCELLOR FOR EXTERNAL RELATIONS AT CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE AND BOUGHT DONALD ON BEHALF OF A NUMBER OF COMMUNITY COLLEGE. DISTRICTS YOU CAN GO FORWARD. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON- CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M DAVID O'BRIEN VICE CHANCELLOR FOR GOVERNMENT RELATIONS FOR THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES WE'RE PLEASED TO BE HERE TODAY TESTIFIED IN SUPPORT OF AB ELEVEN EIGHTY SEVEN NOW KEEP MY TESTIMONY FAIRLY BRIEF BECAUSE ASSEMBLYMEMBER IRWIN ACTUALLY I HAD A LOT OF THE IMPORTANT POINTS BUT IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THIS LEGISLATURE DID TAKE HISTORIC ACTION TO ELIMINATE LONGSTANDING INEQUITIES IN ACCESS TO. TRANSFER LEVEL ENGLISH AND MATH BY ADOPTING A B. SEVEN OH FIVE THANKS TO THE LEADERSHIP OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER IRWIN AND AS COLLEGES HAVE IMPLEMENTED AB SEVEN OH FIVE AND LOWER THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS ENROLLED IN THOSE PRE TRANSFER LEVEL FORMALLY KNOWN AS REMEDIAL COURSES THERE'S BEEN A DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS ENROLLED. IN SUPERVISED TUTORING EVEN THOUGH IT'S A PROVEN EFFECTIVE TOOL TO SUPPORT ECONOMIC SUCCESS- A STUDY CONDUCTED BY THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE ACTUALLY FOUND THAT THE COURSE SUCCESS RATE FOR STUDENTS WHO RECEIVE TUTORING IN BASIC SKILLS ENGLISH AND MATH WAS ON AVERAGE 8% HIGHER THAN STUDENTS WHO DID NOT. AND AS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER REFERENCED CURRENT LAW RESTRICTS APPORTIONMENT FUNDING FOR THE SUPERVISED TUTORING- COURSES AND THIS LIMITATION ESSENTIALLY MEANS THE COLLEGES DON'T HAVE THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO EXPAND THIS CRITICAL TOOL SO AB ELEVEN EIGHTY SEVEN WOULD REMOVE THIS RESTRICTION REMOVE SOME OF THE CONFUSION A CURRENT LAW THAT YOUR- EXCELLENT STAFF ANALYSIS REFERENCES. AND RESULT IN HIGHER STUDENT COURSE COMPLETION AND SUCCESS RATES SO JUST WANT TO SAY THAT IT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE PARADIGM THAT EIGHTY SEVEN OH FIVE ESTABLISHES RECEIVE THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER OR STAFF AND THIS COMMITTEE STAFF AND.

WHO'S VICE PRESIDENT OF INSTRUCTION FOR WOODLAND COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND HE WASN'T ABLE TO BE HERE AT A BANK MAKE IT BRIEF. BUT IT WOODLAND STUDENTS TO USE TUTORING AVERAGE AN ENTIRE LETTER GRADE HIGHER. AND HAVE A GREATER CHANCE OF PASSING THEIR COURSES. IN ADDITION TO SUCCESS TUTORING IS AN EQUITY FOCUSED PRACTICE. 77% OF OUR TUTORING STUDENTS ARE IDENTIFIED AS FIRST GENERATION. 81% AS LOW INCOME. AND 83% FROM DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED RACIAL AND ETHNIC GROUPS- CURRENTLY COLLEGES CAN ONLY GENERATE TUTORING. FOR BASIC SKILLS COURSES WHICH GOES AGAINST WHAT SEVEN A. B. SEVEN OH FIVE WAS TRYING TO DO. BRIEFLY THIS BILL WOULD INCLUDE DEGREE OF POLITICAL APPLICABLE ENTRANCE FOUR COURSES AS ELIGIBLE FOR APPORTIONMENT ACCOMPLISHING THREE THINGS COLLEGES WOULD BE PROVIDED WITH A RELIABLE FINANCIAL INCENTIVE TO PROVIDE THE SCIENTIFIC SERVICE. COLLEGES WOULD BE A BIT ABLE ABLE TO BETTER SUPPORT STUDENT SUCCESS AND ALL COURSES ESPECIALLY TRANSFER LEVEL MATH AND ENGLISH AND COLLEGES WOULD BETTER AND BETTER COURSES SUCCESS RATES LEAD TO SHORTER COMPLETION TIMES FOR STUDENTS SAY TAXPAYERS THE COST OF COURSE COMPLETION.
