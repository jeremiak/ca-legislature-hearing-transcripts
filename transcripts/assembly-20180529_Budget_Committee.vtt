00:13:32.412 --> 00:13:34.514 region:rollup2
WANT TO COMMEND THE WORK OF OUR

00:13:33.446 --> 00:13:35.882 region:rollup2
BUDGET SUB COMMITTEES OVER THE

00:13:34.514 --> 00:13:36.949 region:rollup2
LAST SIX MONTHS.

00:13:35.882 --> 00:13:38.518 region:rollup2
I THINK PEOPLE OUTSIDE THE

00:13:36.949 --> 00:13:39.786 region:rollup2
BUDGET COMMITTEE PROCESS DON'T

00:13:38.518 --> 00:13:41.621 region:rollup2
REALIZE WHAT A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT

00:13:39.786 --> 00:13:41.988 region:rollup2
OF WORK IT IS TO SERVE ON THOSE

00:13:41.621 --> 00:13:44.223 region:rollup2
SUBCOMMITTEES.

00:13:41.988 --> 00:13:45.758 region:rollup2

STAFF THAT WAS THERE TO SUPPORT

00:13:46.559 --> 00:13:50.163 region:rollup2
US OVER THE LAST SIX MONTHS

00:13:48.194 --> 00:13:51.731 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I I KNOW THAT WE'VE

00:13:50.163 --> 00:13:53.633 region:rollup2
WORKED VERY VERY HARD. POP.

00:13:51.731 --> 00:13:55.201 region:rollup2
I THINK IT IS A VERY UNUSUAL

00:13:53.633 --> 00:13:56.169 region:rollup2
SITUATION WE FIND OURSELVES AND

00:13:55.201 --> 00:13:57.770 region:rollup2
TO HOW TO SPEND A NINE BILLION

00:13:56.169 --> 00:13:59.305 region:rollup2
DOLLAR SURPLUS.

00:13:57.770 --> 00:14:00.807 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT OUT OF THE CHAIR

00:13:59.305 --> 00:14:02.375 region:rollup2
AND I SHARE A LOT OF THE

00:14:00.807 --> 00:14:04.243 region:rollup2
COMMITMENTS TO OTHER INVESTMENTS

00:14:02.375 --> 00:14:05.645 region:rollup2
IN INFRASTRUCTURE. NOW AND

00:14:04.243 --> 00:14:07.780 region:rollup2
SHORING UP THE STATE'S RESERVE

00:14:05.645 --> 00:14:09.916 region:rollup2
FUNDS ARE HOWEVER I I HAVE SOME

00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:10.416 region:rollup2
FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEMS WITH THE

00:14:09.916 --> 00:14:11.351 region:rollup2
BUDGET THAT WE HAVE PUT

00:14:10.416 --> 00:14:13.219 region:rollup2
TOGETHER.

00:14:11.351 --> 00:14:15.088 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT TOTHE EXTENT THAT

00:14:13.219 --> 00:14:16.222 region:rollup2
WE SPEND THAT SURPLUS WE NEED TO

00:14:15.088 --> 00:14:16.656 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE WE'RE SPENDING ON

00:14:16.222 --> 00:14:18.157 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT ARE TRUE

00:14:16.656 --> 00:14:19.592 region:rollup2
INVESTMENTS.

00:14:18.157 --> 00:14:21.728 region:rollup2
IN CALIFORNIA AND BY INVESTMENT

00:14:19.592 --> 00:14:23.763 region:rollup2
I MEAN A DOLLARS THAT YOU SPEND

00:14:21.728 --> 00:14:24.364 region:rollup2
TODAY EQUALS LESS MONEY THAT

00:14:23.763 --> 00:14:25.498 region:rollup2
YOU'LL HAVE TO SPEND IN THE

00:14:24.364 --> 00:14:26.899 region:rollup2
FUTURE. AND I SHARE THE

00:14:25.498 --> 00:14:28.468 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR'S CONCERNED ABOUT

00:14:26.899 --> 00:14:30.970 region:rollup2
SPENDING MONEY THE CREEK CREATE

00:14:28.468 --> 00:14:32.205 region:rollup2
SPENDING PRESSURE IN FUTURE.

00:14:30.970 --> 00:14:33.339 region:rollup2
YEARS AND FOR FUTURE

00:14:32.205 --> 00:14:33.906 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE'S AND I'M AFRAID

00:14:33.339 --> 00:14:34.874 region:rollup2
THAT WERE DOING TOO MUCH OF

00:14:33.906 --> 00:14:36.609 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:14:34.874 --> 00:14:38.077 region:rollup2
IN THIS BUDGET HIGH AND I HAVE

00:14:36.609 --> 00:14:39.312 region:rollup2
OF ONE KIND OF OVERRIDING

00:14:38.077 --> 00:14:40.747 region:rollup2
CONCERN.

00:14:39.312 --> 00:14:42.982 region:rollup2
AND THAT IS THAT THE CREATION OF

00:14:40.747 --> 00:14:44.050 region:rollup2
A THIRD. A BUDGET DEFICIT

00:14:42.982 --> 00:14:44.951 region:rollup2
SAVINGS ACCOUNT A THIRD RESERVE

00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:46.486 region:rollup2
ACCOUNT FOR.

00:14:44.951 --> 00:14:48.388 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT IN SORT OF SOME OF

00:14:46.486 --> 00:14:50.156 region:rollup2
THIS RESERVE.

00:14:48.388 --> 00:14:52.158 region:rollup2
WE ALREADY HAVE TO BUDGET

00:14:50.156 --> 00:14:53.559 region:rollup2
RESERVES ACCOUNTS THE.

00:14:52.158 --> 00:14:54.994 region:rollup2
THE OLD RECALL THE RAINY DAY

00:14:53.559 --> 00:14:56.596 region:rollup2
FUND THE BUDGET STABILIZATION

00:14:54.994 --> 00:14:58.064 region:rollup2
ACCOUNT AND THE SPECIAL FUND FOR

00:14:56.596 --> 00:15:00.133 region:rollup2
ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTIES AND

00:14:58.064 --> 00:15:02.168 region:rollup2
ALTHOUGH THE BSA HAS A CAP THE

00:15:00.133 --> 00:15:03.703 region:rollup2
SFE YOU DOES NOT HAVE A CAP.

00:15:02.168 --> 00:15:06.272 region:rollup2
SO THE ONLY REASON TO CREATE A

00:15:03.703 --> 00:15:07.807 region:rollup2
THIRD TYPE OF ACCOUNT. IS IF WE

00:15:06.272 --> 00:15:08.374 region:rollup2
WANTED TO AVOID ON AUTOMATIC

00:15:07.807 --> 00:15:10.309 region:rollup2
REDUCTION IN THE STATE SALES

00:15:08.374 --> 00:15:12.779 region:rollup2
TAX.

00:15:10.309 --> 00:15:13.446 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE ONLY CONSEQUENCE OF

00:15:12.779 --> 00:15:15.148 region:rollup2
PUTTING MORE MONEY IN THE US AND

00:15:13.446 --> 00:15:16.849 region:rollup2
FOR YOU. SO THE ONLY REASON FOR

00:15:15.148 --> 00:15:18.017 region:rollup2
CREATING THAT THIRD ACCOUNT IS

00:15:16.849 --> 00:15:19.819 region:rollup2
TO AVOID GIVING THE PEOPLE OF

00:15:18.017 --> 00:15:21.387 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA BREAK ON THEIR SALES

00:15:19.819 --> 00:15:22.455 region:rollup2
TAX AND I THINK A BRAKE IS

00:15:21.387 --> 00:15:24.123 region:rollup2
BECAUSE APPROPRIATE IN AN ERA

00:15:22.455 --> 00:15:25.925 region:rollup2
WHEN. A LOT OF OUR CONSTITUENTS

00:15:24.123 --> 00:15:27.827 region:rollup2

IN THE STATE THEM IN AN ERA WHEN

00:15:27.827 --> 00:15:30.062 region:rollup2
THE STATE HAS A NINE BILLION

00:15:28.728 --> 00:15:31.631 region:rollup2
DOLLAR BUDGET SURPLUS SO I'M

00:15:30.062 --> 00:15:33.399 region:rollup2
GONNA CONTINUE TO ADVOCATE. THAT

00:15:31.631 --> 00:15:35.568 region:rollup2
WE FUND THE SFE YOU INSTEAD OF

00:15:33.399 --> 00:15:38.237 region:rollup2
CREATING A A THIRD TYPE OF

00:15:35.568 --> 00:15:38.838 region:rollup2

TAX AND CAPITAL GAINS BOTH OF

00:46:20.678 --> 00:46:25.249 region:rollup2
WHICH ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO

00:46:22.446 --> 00:46:26.550 region:rollup2
PREDICT AN EXTREMELY VOLATILE.

00:46:25.249 --> 00:46:27.985 region:rollup2
ON THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE

00:46:26.550 --> 00:46:29.687 region:rollup2
ALEJO REVENUE FORECASTS ARE

00:46:27.985 --> 00:46:31.489 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT THEY BOTH

00:46:29.687 --> 00:46:33.291 region:rollup2
ARE ACTUALLY PRESUMING CONTINUED

00:46:31.489 --> 00:46:35.026 region:rollup2
ECONOMIC GROWTH.

00:46:33.291 --> 00:46:36.661 region:rollup2
ALTHOUGH THE ADMINISTRATION'S

00:46:35.026 --> 00:46:38.262 region:rollup2
AT A SLOWER CLIP

00:46:36.661 --> 00:46:40.031 region:rollup2
I AM EVEN THAT HAS SOME OF US

00:46:38.262 --> 00:46:41.866 region:rollup2
NERVOUS A WE ARE REACHING.

00:46:40.031 --> 00:46:44.101 region:rollup2
THE POINT OF OUR ECONOMIC

00:46:41.866 --> 00:46:46.003 region:rollup2
EXPANSION BEING ONE OF THE

00:46:44.101 --> 00:46:47.638 region:rollup2
LONGEST IN HISTORY. AND AS SUCH

00:46:46.003 --> 00:46:49.940 region:rollup2
WE THINK ON THAT THERE ARE MANY

00:46:47.638 --> 00:46:52.443 region:rollup2
RISKS ON THE HORIZON.

00:46:49.940 --> 00:46:54.045 region:rollup2
THE LA OH FORECAST RELIES ON THE

00:46:52.443 --> 00:46:55.746 region:rollup2

WITH THE GROWTH RATE OF SIX

00:47:00.818 --> 00:47:02.853 region:rollup2
POINT SEVEN PERCENT WHICH WOULD

00:47:01.452 --> 00:47:05.723 region:rollup2
BE TO

00:47:02.853 --> 00:47:06.190 region:rollup2
PERCENT ANA ABOVE FINANCES AND

00:47:05.723 --> 00:47:07.458 region:rollup2

HISTORICALLY.

00:47:07.458 --> 00:47:10.695 region:rollup2
BOTH THE ADMINISTRATION AND

ALEJO ARE ASSUMING ROBUST GROWTH

00:47:10.695 --> 00:47:13.931 region:rollup2

ON THE LA OF CAPITAL GAINS IS

00:47:21.505 --> 00:47:23.207 region:rollup2
HIGHER THAN THE

00:47:21.872 --> 00:47:25.176 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION'S.

00:47:23.207 --> 00:47:26.644 region:rollup2
IN SEVENTEEN AND EIGHTEEN AT A

TWO BILLION SO THAT GIVES YOU A

00:47:41.959 --> 00:47:45.062 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT OF CONTACTS ABOUT THE

00:47:43.227 --> 00:47:46.397 region:rollup2
GROWTH. THAT FRANKLY WERE BOTH

00:47:45.062 --> 00:47:47.798 region:rollup2
PROJECTING.
