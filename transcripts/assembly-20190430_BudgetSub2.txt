HEARING THIS IS THE ASSEMBLY BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE ON EDUCATION FINANCE TODAY WE'RE GOING TO BE DISCUSSING. A HASTINGS COLLEGE OF LAW. THE CALIFORNIA STATE LIBRARY IN THE CALIFORNIA'S TO NEED COMMISSION. IN A REVERSE ORDER SO FIRST ISSUE WE'RE GOING TO HEAR IS THAT. IS THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION AND WE KNOW THE GOVERNOR HAS TO PROPOSALS IN THE BUDGET THAT DROP BUT JANUARY BUDGET TO EXPAND FINANCIAL AID. THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT ARE SUBCOMMITTEE HAS DISCUSSED FOR A FEW YEARS NOW AND WE'RE THINK WHERE IT FINALLY AT A PLACE FOR ONE AND TAKE SOME ACTION TO REALLY LOOK AT REVAMPING OUR FINANCIAL AID. SYSTEM A MODERNIZING THAT CALTRAIN THE MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAMS TO TO MAKE THEM EASIER TO NAVIGATE AND FRANKLY LOOK AT THE STUDENTS WHO ARE JUST MISSING OUT BECAUSE OF SOME. ARBITRARY CUT OFF POINTS AS WELL AS LOOKING AT THE TOTAL COST OF TUITION AND HOW FINANCIAL AID -- DEALS WITH THAT WOULD STUDENTS IN THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY. SO WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT A FEW PROPOSALS THAT WE HAVE -- THIS YEAR. AND THE CA COMMISSION WALK US THROUGH SOME OF THE COST ESTIMATES FOR THAT -- WE'RE ALSO GOING TO OF COURSE TALK ABOUT OUR STATE LIBRARY SYSTEM AND HOW THEY COULD. BETTER SERVE OUR COMMUNITIES ESPECIALLY AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND FINALLY HEARING FROM. HASTINGS. COLLEGE OF LAW ABOUT SOME OF THEIR ISSUES SPECIFICALLY SOME OF THEIR BUDGET -- CONCERNS WITHIN ROMAN HOW THEY PLAN ON MOVING FORWARD -- SO WITH THAT LET'S BEGIN WITH THE STUDENT COMMISSION ITEMS. ISSUE NUMBER ONE IS THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL RELATED. FIRST BE OFFERING. ISSUE NUMBER ONE IS THE IS THE PROPOSAL FROM THE GOVERNOR ON STUDENTS WITH DEPENDENT CHILDREN AND INCREASED FINANCIAL AID AWARDS. YES DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS BEACH AND MARRY OUR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- JUST TO GIVE YOU A HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES TOTAL FINANCIAL AID EXPENDITURES OF JUST OVER TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION. AS YOUR AGENDA NOTES THAT THE COMBINATION OF ONE POINT SIX BILLION GENERAL FUND AND ONE POINT ONE BILLION AND REIMBURSEMENTS THE LARGEST SHARE OF WHICH IS TEMPORARY ASSISTANCE FOR NEEDY FAMILIES ARE TAN F.. AND OF COURSE -- EVEN THOUGH WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE ISSUES WERE HAPPY TO DISCUSS ANY OF THE ESTIMATES THAT ARE INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. THE FIRST ISSUE THAT YOUR AGENDA NOTES AS THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL FOR A NEW NON TUITION GRANT TO ASSIST CAL GRANT RECIPIENTS FOR STUDENTS WITH DEPENDENT CHILDREN AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY AND THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES AT A COST OF ONE OF ONE HUNDRED TWENTY ONE POINT SIX MILLION ONGOING GENERAL FUND. THESE NEW AWARDS WILL BE UP TO SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR CAL GRANT A AND B. STUDENTS REFLECTING AN INCREASE TO THE ACCESS AWARD THAT BE STUDENTS ALREADY RECEIVE. UP TO FOUR THOUSAND FOR CAL GRANT SEE STUDENTS. THIS PROPOSAL IS GUIDED BY THE ADMINISTRATION'S GOAL OF TACKLING INTER GENERATIONAL POVERTY BY SUPPORTING STUDENT PARENTS IN THEIR PERSISTENCE IN HIGHER EDUCATION. THANK YOU AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. OKAY THANK YOU LA A THANK YOU MISTER KING WITH LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. I'LL BE SPEAKING FROM YOUR TEN DAY STARTING AT THE TOP OF PAGE. THREE AS THE SUBCOMMITTEE KNOWS WHILE STUDENTS FACE NOT ONLY TUITION COSTS BUT ALSO IN ON TUITION COSTS ASSOCIATED FOOD HOUSING TRANSPORTATION AND OTHER. LIVING EXPENSES. THE STATE DOES CURRENTLYPROVIDE SOME NON TUITION COVERAGE THROUGH A WIDE CENTER BULLETIN OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS PAGE HERE. SPECIFICALLY A COW CAN'T BE RECIPIENTS RECEIVE ACCESS AWARD OF JUST OVER SIXTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR. AND HOW CAN SEE RECIPIENTS RECEIVE A SMALLER BOOK AND SUPPLY A WIDE AMY IS A LIVING EXPENSES. THERE IS SOME VARIATION IN THE LIVING EXPENSES AT DIFFERENT STUDENTS FACE SEND ONE SOURCE OF POTENTIAL VARIATION IS THAT STUDENTS WHO HAVE DEPENDENT CHILDREN STUDENT PARENTS. LIKELY FACE HIGHER COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH FOOD PERHAPS HOUSING LIKELY CHILD CARE. IMPORTANTLY STUDENT PARENTS ARE NOT NECESSARILY GUARANTEED A CAL GRANT AS YOU'LL SEE AT THE TOP OF PAGE FOR MOST STUDENTS PARENTS ARE SERVED BY THE COMPETITIVE AWARD PROGRAM. AND BECAUSE OF THE LIMITED NUMBER OF COMPETITIVE AWARDS AVAILABLE THAT MEANS THAT ONLY A SMALL SHARE OF THOSE WHO ARE FINANCIALLY ELIGIBLE FOR IT HOW CAN. GO ON TO RECEIVE. AS THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCES NOTED THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES ABOUT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWO MILLION ON GOING TO PROVIDE. ADDITIONAL NON TUITION COVERAGE FOR STUDENTS PARENTS. OUR SYSTEM OF THIS PROPOSAL. BEGINS ON PAGE FIVE OF YOUR AGENDA. WE GET THE GOVERNOR IDENTIFIES A POTENTIALLY IMPORTANT AREA OF NEED. THIS SUB GROUP OF STUDENTS WHOSE FINANCIAL NEEDS ARE LIKELY NOT MET BY OUR CURRENT SYSTEM. THAT BEING SAID WE HAVE A NUMBER OF CONCERNS WITH HOW THE PROPOSAL IS CURRENTLY STRUCTURED. THE FIRST OF THOSE CONCERNS IS THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS. EXPRESSED AN INTEREST IN SIMPLIFYING THE COW CAN SYSTEM. AND STREAMLINING THE VARIOUS RULES AFFECTING ELIGIBILITY IN A WIDE. FIVE WE THINK THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WOULD ACT COUNTER TO THE SUBJECTIVE BY INTRODUCING A NEW SET OF RULES THAT ONLY IMPACT ONE SUBGROUP OF FINANCIALLY NEEDY STUDENTS OF COMPLICATING THE SYSTEM FOR STUDENTS TO NAVIGATE. TURN THE PAGE ALSO SEE THAT WE HAVE A RELATED DISTRIBUTIONAL CONCERN. WHAT IS STUDENT HAS CHILDREN IS ONE PART OF THEIR OVERALL FINANCIAL NEED? OTHER MAJOR FACTORS THAT MIGHT SHAPE THAT NEED INCLUDE THE STUDENTS HOUSEHOLD INCOME ASSET SIZE AND SO FORTH. WE ARE CONCERNED THAT BY A PRIORITIZE NEED ACCORDING TO ONE COMPONENT OF THE OVERALL NEED THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL COULD LEAVE OUT SOME PARTICULARLY NEEDY STUDENTS INCLUDING SME OF WHOM HAVE ZERO EXPECTED FAMILY CONTRIBUTION TO THE COLLEGE COSTS. BASED ON THAT PANEL STATUS. IT IS ALSO WORTH NOTING THAT. MANY STUDENTS PARENTS WOULD NOT RECEIVE ADDITIONAL AID UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL FOR THE REASON WE DISCUSSED EARLIER. WHICH IS THE MOST STUDENT PARENTS ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR THE ENTITLEMENT PROGRAM AND THE SMITH COMPETE FOR A LIMITED NUMBER OF COMPATIBLE WITH. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WOULD NOT PROVIDE ADDITIONAL ASSISTANCE THE STUDENTS WERE ELIGIBLE FOR BUT NOT OFFERED A COMPETITIVE AWARD. IT ALSO WOULD NOT PROVIDE ADDITIONAL ASSISTANCE FOR STUDENTS PARENTS OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR SICE REGARDLESS OF THEIR LEVEL OF FINANCIAL NEED. FOR THESE REASONS WE DO RECOMMEND REJECTING THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL BUT WE KNOW ONCE AGAIN THAT. THIS PROPOSAL RAISES IMPORTANT QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER OUR CURRENT SYSTEMS ARE MEETING THE NEEDS OF STUDENTS PARENTS. AND SO THE LEGISLATURE MAY WISH TO PROVIDE TO PURSUE FURTHER STUDY OF THIS TOPIC. IF SO THAT WOULD INVOLVE BETTER UNDERSTANDING NOT ONLY THE PARTICULAR COSTS THAT STUDENT PARENTS FACE BUT ALSO THE LEVEL SUPPORT CURRENTLY AVAILABLE TO THEM THROUGH. BOTH THE STATE'S FINANCIAL AID SYSTEM AND EXISTING SOCIAL SERVICES SUCH AS COMPRESSION CALLING. THANK YOU I'D BE HAPPY TO TAKE IN QUESTION. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING CHAIR MEMBERS DAVID O'BRIEN WITH THE CALIFORNIA STUDENT AID COMMISSION -- WE JUST WANT TO NOTE THAT -- FROM OUR VANTAGE POINT IT IS SIGNIFICANT TO THE ADMINISTRATION RECOGNIZES AS WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING AS WE WILL DISCUSS LATER IN THIS HEARING THAT THE CHANGING DEMOGRAPHIC OF TODAY'S STUDENT -- CREATES CHANGING NEEDS AMONG TODAY'S STUDENTS AND THE US -- I NEED TO MAKE SURE FINANCIALLY SYSTEM STAYS UP TO DATE SO WHILE WE'RE NOT WEIGHING IN WITH AN OFFICIAL SUPPORT OPPOSE TYPE POSITION -- ON THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL WOULD KNOW THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT -- THE RESEARCH CONSISTENTLY SHOWS THAT STUDENTS PARENTS FACE -- EXCEPTIONALLY HIGH COSTS AND WE WOULD JUST SAY THAT -- WE APPRECIATE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS RECOGNIZE THE NEEDS OF THIS POPULATION AND AS PART OF OUR ONGOING EFFORTS TO ENSURE THAT ADULT LEARNERS RETURNING STUDENTS. CAN'T AFFORD AN ACCESS TO HIGHER EDUCATION -- THIS PROPOSAL IS CONSISTENT WITH THOSE GOALS OF PEOPLE WE KNOW THE ADMINISTRATION IS FOR FORT OKAY. ALREADY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. STRUGGLE -- MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENT AT THE BEGINNING THE HEARING WHERE AND YOU STATED. THEIR DESIRE TO LOOK AT SIMPLIFYING THE PROCESS TO SEE KATE. I THINK THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE AS I LOOK BACK AND I I'VE BEEN WATCHING THIS FOR A COUPLE YEARS WE HAVE THIS. YOU KNOW AND THIS MAY SOUND LIKE A SLIGHT BUT IT'S NOT BUT WE HAVE THIS STUDENT AID INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX. WHICH IS VERY -- VERY COMPLEX. FOR STUDENTS TO TO TO MATCH NAY THROUGH MYSELF AS A STUDENT MANY YEARS AGO I FOUND IT. VERY DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS AVAILABLE TO ME IF ANYTHING WAS AVAILABLE TO ME SO I JUST IGNORED IT BECAUSE IT WAS SO COMPLEX. HI I WAS WORKING. IN FULL TIME AT THAT POINT -- AND GOING ALONG THE STATE -- BUT AGAIN I I APPRECIATE THAT AND AGAIN I I JUST I AM. WHAT I'M HEARING FROM MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES IS IS WHERE'S THE SUPPORT FOR THEM I KNOW WE HAVE THE MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP? WHICH IS DONE IN A FROM A BROAD PERSPECTIVE AYE AYE AYE WE NEED TO SUPPORT THAT WE NEED A SPORT THAT MORE. WE DIDN'T MAKE SURE THAT STUDENTS ARE GETTING -- A GOOD SHARE -- GOOD A DECENT NOW. ENOUGH MONEY TO SUPPORT YOUR AVERAGE GETS THROUGH SCHOOL AND IN AN EXPEDITIOUS FASHION SO I'M REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT. THE MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP IS ONE HERE FROM AN A PLUS PARENTS AS THEY FEEL LIKE. YOU KNOW THERE'S SHE WHO WHO SUPPORTING THEM. BECAUSE WHEN YOU'VE GOT A FAMILY EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE MIDDLE CLASS -- SEE ISSUE OR YOU SEE A EDUCATION IS VERY EXPENSIVE. SO AGAIN I WANT TO BE A SUPPORTIVE OF THE MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP. MAKE SURE THAT DOESN'T GET HE WROTE IT IN ANY FASHION AND IN FACT SUPPORT THAT AS WE GO FORWARD TO MAKE MORE MONEY AVAILABLE -- YOU KNOW THE RICH CAN AFFORD IT WE KNOW THAT HI BUT I THINK YOU KNOW I I HEAR A LOT OF MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES AFTER HER VERY FRUSTRATED WITH GOVERNMENT. AND I THINK THAT'S CERTAINLY BLOOD IN OUR POLITICAL ARENA TODAY BECAUSE THEY FEEL LIKE YOU KNOW THIS STATE DOESN'T WATCH OUT FOR THEM. AND SOMETIMES I THINK THAT'S TRUE SO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE SUPPORT THE MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP GOING FORWARD. AND IN FACT EXPAND IT WITHOUT A TURN IT BACK TO YOU MISTER. THANK YOU MISTER O'DONNELL THAT YOU MAKES AN GREAT POINTS IT WILL BE DISCUSSING THOSE IN GREATER LENGTH ISSUE -- NUMBER. FIVE BUT I I GUESS THIS DOES RAISE THAT SAME ISSUE WHICH MISTER O'DONNELL STATES AS WE'RE TRYING -- TO SIMPLIFY THE CAL RANT MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP. AND NOT HAVE ASMANY CARVE OUT SO THIS IS ESSENTIALLY CARVE OUT THIS THING THIS CAL GRANT PROGRAM HAS. IT'S LISTED IN THE AD CODE -- AN INSANE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE YES YOU CAN APPLY FOR THIS YOU GET AFTER THIS BUT NOT THIS PERSON THAT PERSON. AND THAT'S WERE TRYING TO GO THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION WITH THAT NOT THAT'S NOT TO SAY IT'S NOT IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT STUDENTS WHO ARE PARENTS BUT YOU KNOW THIS GOES THE MAJORITY THIS GOES TO STUDENTS IN THE COMPETITIVE. GRANT AND YOU HAVE TO SUCH A WIN THE LOTTERY. TO GET A COMPETITIVE GRANT YOU YOUR ODDS ARE ONE IN FIFTEEN SO DIRECT. THEY'RE ABOUT CS YES -- 67% CHANCE. AND SO THOSE STUDENTS ALREADY WON THE LOTTERY SO THEY'RE GETTING A SECOND LOTTERY. WINNING BY THIS WERE SOME SINCE YOU DIDN'T GET BETTER IN THE FIRST PLACE. THAT I DON'T HAVE A CHANCE TO COMPETE FOR THIS -- THIS THAT THIS PARENT GRANT SO I THINK THOSE ARE SOME QUESTIONS WE DON'T WANT TO MINIMIZE THE IMPACT -- IN THE COST BIRTH PARENTS GOING TO COLLEGE AND YOU KNOW IT'S GETTING HARDER AND HARDER I CAN'T I DON'T EVEN I CAN IMAGINE THAT. THIRTY YEARS AGO MY MY LATE MOTHER HAD FOUR KIDS. WORK AT A BANK TWO BLOCKS FROM HERE. AND WAS A SINGLE MOM AND WENT TO SCHOOL AT NIGHT. AND WORK DURING THE DAY AND RAISED FOUR KIDS ON OUR OWN. AND THAT SHE WAS ABLE TO DO IT WITH THE FINANCIAL WITH THE CAL GRANT EQUIVALENT BACK THEN AND NOW NO WAY. THE DECK IS STACKED AGAINST YOU SO MUCH THAT I DON'T EVEN. UNDERSTAND HOW SOME OF THESE -- THESE THESE THAT STUDENTS AND STUDENTS TO A PARENT'S MULTIPLE KIDS AND ONE KID OF WHAT HAVE YOU. CAN MANAGE THE THE COST OF THE FINANCIAL AID -- THE SYSTEM HERE IN CALIFORNIA SO YOU KNOW THIS IS ENTERING PROPOSAL WE'RE GOING TO HOLD UP AND WE WANT TO EVALUATE THIS IN TOTALITY. OF THE OTHER CAL GRANT -- IDEAS WE HAVE. IN THE IN THE BUDGET SO -- WILL PRESENT WILL PROCEED WITH ISSUE NUMBER TWO NOW ABOUT THE COMPETITIVE CAL GRANT PROPOSAL. THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES FUNDING FOUR THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY NEW CAL GRANT COMPETITIVE AWARDS ANNUALLY AT A COST OF NINE POINT SIX MILLION ON GOING GENERAL FUND. THE COMPETITIVE PROGRAM IS AVAILABLE TO STUDENTS WHO ARE IN ELIGIBLE FOR AN ENTITLEMENT OUTLINED BY THE COMMISSION. SO WITH THIS INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF ANNUAL COMPETITIVE AWARDS WILL RAISE FROM 250-007-0050 TWO THIRTY THOUSAND ANNUALLY. OKAY LA A THANK YOU. AS WE JUST DISCUSSED ONLY A SMALL SHARE OF STUDENTS WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR COMPETITIVE CAL GRANT CURRENTLY RECEIVE AN AWARD OFFER BECAUSE OF THE LIMIT ON AVAILABLE WARRANT. FOR THIS MEANS THAT IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN THERE WERE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED NINETY THOUSAND ELIGIBLE APPLICANTS FOR COMPETITIVE AWARDS WHO WERE NOT OFFERED. ONE AND THOSE ELIGIBLE NON ORTIZ HAD AN AVERAGE INCOME OF ABOUT TWENTY SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS. THIS IS JUST A SAID THERE IS A LARGE AMOUNT OF UNMET DEMAND IN THE COMPETITIVE PROGRAM. AMONG STUDENTS WHO HAVE HIGH FINANCIAL NEED. GIVEN THAT WE DO THINK THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IS REASONABLE. IF LEGISLATURE WISHES TO AUGMENT FUNDING FOR THE CAL GRANT PROGRAM. WE RECOMMEND PRIORITIZING THIS PROPOSAL THANK YOU. THANK YOU CHAIR DAVID O'BRIEN AT THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION -- AS YOU MENTIONED AND ECHOING WITH THE LA ON THE PARTNER FINANCES SAID THE COMPETITIVE CAL GRANT PROGRAM IS -- MASSIVELY OVERSUBSCRIBED BE AVAILABLE NUMBER OF AWARDS IS NOT REMOTELY KEPT UP WITH THE DEMAND AND THIS IS THE PRIMARY FINANCIALLY PROGRAM THAT SERVES -- WHAT WE ONCE CALLED NONTRADITIONAL STUDENTS THAT ARE INCREASINGLY BECOMING SORT OF THE NEW NORMAL -- ADULT LEARNERS AND RETURNING STUDENTS IN A PARTICULAR COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS SO -- INCREASING THE NUMBER OF AVAILABLE WORDS IS VERY MUCH A PRIORITY FOR US OF THE COMMISSION. YES SO THIS IS A BIG PRIORITY OF THE COMMITTEE AS WELL WE'VE TRIED LAST YEAR'S TO INCREASE THAT THE NUMBER OF COMPETITIVE AWARDS SAID. MAKE IT MORE LIKELY THAT. THAT -- THE ONE IN. FIFTEEN A RATIO -- CHANGES. WHAT'S THE TOTAL NUMBER OF OF OF COMPETITIVE AWARDS WE WOULD NEED TO TO TO FULLY FUND ELIGIBILITY -- TYPICALLY IT'S OVER -- THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND FINANCIALLY ELIGIBLE STUDENTS APPLY EVERY YEAR I FIND IT'S TWENTY SOMETHING THOUSAND RIGHT TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEAH THIS WILL GET US THIS WE GET FOUR THOUSAND MORE. TO THE THREE TO THIRTY THOUSAND CORRECT YEAH SO THE QUESTION THAT KIND OF WITH A SIMILAR ISSUE BEFORE IS THAT. PARENTS REPRESENT ROUGHLY 9% OF CAL RENT RECIPIENTS ACCORDING TO THE AGENDA. AND SO THE 9% WHO GET THE COMPETITIVE FOR ACOSTA BOB AND THERE'S A BUNCH AT 91% OF NOT THE MATHIS QUITE WORK BUT A HUGE NUMBER OF A PROBABLY STUDENT. PERRANCE THE PLIGHT FOR THE COMPETITIVE DID EVEN GET THE COMPETITIVE. SO SHE SAID THIS TO THE STUDENT COMMISSIONER LA L. CAN THINK THAT WE SHOULD CONSIDER. I'M USING THATTO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF COMPETITIVE EVEN TARGET COMPETITORS FOR STUDENTS WHO ARE PARENTS. I WILL BE FROM THE COMMISSION PERSPECTIVE WE HAD NECESSARILY. THOUGHT ABOUT DOING A TARGET WITHIN THE COMPETITIVE PROGRAM -- WE'VE TENDED TO TAKE MORE OF A BLANKET POSITION THAT ANY INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF AVAILABLE WORDS. IS YOU KNOW A GOOD THING AND THAT WE WOULD SUPPORT IT AND THAT IT WOULD HAVE THOSE SORT OF RIPPLE POSITIVE AFFECTS -- SO I WILL JUST SAY THAT -- WHILE WE YOU KNOW CERTAINLY RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE UNIQUE POPULATIONS THAT HAVE. SPECIFIC NEEDS SUCH AS STUDENT PARENTS I DON'T THINK THAT WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF A COMPETITIVE PROGRAM WE HAVE CONSIDERED WHETHER OR NOT THERE SHOULD BE SOME SORT OF SPECIFIC TARGETING JUST YET [inaudible] IS THAT. IN OUR SYSTEM WE DID CONSIDER THAT THE LEGISLATURE MAY WISH TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF COMPETITIVE AWARDS BY EVEN MORE THAN WHAT TO INCLUDE IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. CONSERVING COULD EARN ALICE'S SYSTEM PLAST MEANT THAT EVERY ADDITIONAL ONE MILLION DOLLARS WOULD ALLOW THE STATE AUTHORIZED ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY EIGHT ADDITIONAL ACCESS TO WHERE IT'S THAT BEING SAID I BELIEVE THAT IN ISSUE FIVE OF THE AGENDA TODAY THERE'LL BE A PRESENTATION ON FURTHER COST ESTIMATES TO TAKE. INTO ACCOUNT FOR EXAMPLE THE COST OF ADDITIONAL RENEW AWARDS FROM EXPANDING THE PROGRAM CORRECT SO WE DO WANT. TO EXPLORE THIS COMPETITIVE ISSUE AND HAVING MORE AWARDS AND POTENTIALLY -- ADJUSTING THE THE THE AGE REQUIREMENT FOR COMPETITIVE FIRST ENTITLEMENT IN MORE WE'LL GET TO THAT. IN A IN A FEW MOMENTS SO WITH THAT WILL HOLD THIS ISSUE OPEN LESS ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM. COMMITTEE MEMBERS. SING NINE SO WE'LL MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER THREE GRANT DELIVERY SYSTEM MODERNIZATION. THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES SIX POINT TWO MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND FOR THE SECOND YEAR OF PROJECT COSTS. FOR THE COMMISSION'S GRANT DELIVERY SYSTEM MODERNIZATION PROJECT FINANCE IN THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE PROJECT REGULARLY AND CAN SAY THAT THE PROJECT IS CURRENTLY ON TIME AND ON BUDGET. JUST NEED COMMISSION IS CURRENTLY IN ITS FIRST YEAR OF THAT CAN'T DELIVERY SYSTEM MODERNIZATION PROJECT AND BASS MARV YOU BECOME CARELESS DEPARTMENT FINANCE THIS PROJECT IS GENERALLY ON SCHEDULE AND WITHIN BUDGET. AS THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE NOTED THIS PROJECT IS ALSO RECEIVING OVERSIGHT FROM THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY. WHO IS CONSISTENTLY PROVIDED AT WAVE POSITIVE RATINGS ON A MONTHLY BASIS FOR THESE REASONS WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO FIGHT A SECONDARY FUNDING FOR THIS PROJECT? CURRENTLY THE STATE NEED COMMISSION ANTICIPATES COMPLETING THIS PROJECT DURING THE TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE FISCAL YEAR AND SO WE ANTICIPATE THAT THE LEGISLATURE MAY HAVE AN ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITY TO FIGHT OVERSIGHT AS PART OF NEXT YEAR'S BUDGET PROCESS. THANK YOU. SO THIS IS THE FINAL PAYMENT. THIS IS THE FINAL YEAR OF PROJECTS SET UP COSTS -- AND THEN THERE WILL BE SOME MAINTENANCE SOME OPERATIONS COSTS AND THE THEREAFTER MY COLLEAGUE RENDER BEINGS WHOSE OUR CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICER. CAN ANSWER ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS YEAH BUT I JUST WANT TO NOTE FOR VERY APPRECIATIVE OF THE MINISTRATION -- AND THE ALIENS RECOMMENDATION FOR THEIR SUPPORT AT THIS CRUCIAL PROJECT OKAY. GOOD MORNING ARE YOU HERE FOR QUESTIONS OR YOUR SERVERS AT QUESTIONS OKAY THANK YOU. I'M NOT I DO NOT HAVE ANY QUESTIONS I KNOW WE HAVE DISCUSSED THIS -- FOR DISLEY THE FIFTH BUDGET YEAR THAT I'VE BEEN HERE WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS AND SO -- OF COURSE WE HAVE THE RECOMMENDATION FROM THE LA -- AS WELL. AND I THINK A LOT OF THIS WAS AT THE EARLY STAGES OF GO NO GO SO -- QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. SEEING NONE -- WE WILL. APPROVED THIS -- AFTER THE FINAL REVISION SELLER HOLD THIS ISSUE UP. ISSUE NUMBER FOR STATE OPERATION SUPPORTS. THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES THREE HUNDRED NINETY THOUSAND GENERAL FUND OF WHICH TWO HUNDRED NINETY THOUSAND IS ONGOING AND THREE PERMANENT POSITION. TO SUPPORT THE COMMISSION'S OPERATIONS A HUNDRED THOUSAND IS FOR SYSTEM UPDATES TO THE CURRENT GRANT DELIVERY SYSTEM TO ACCOUNT FOR RECENTLY ENACTED LEGISLATION EXPANDING CAL GRANT B. AND CHAFEE GRANT ELIGIBILITY FOR FOSTER YOUTH. OF THE THREE POSITIONS TO EIGHT TO ASSOCIATE GOVERNMENTAL PROGRAM ANALYSTS WILL BE PROVIDED TO THE INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT DIVISION AND ONE OFFICE TECHNICIAN WILL BE PROVIDED TO SUPPORT THE EXECUTIVE STAFF AT THE CONNECTION [inaudible] THANK YOU. I'LL BE DISCUSSING THESE THREE PROPOSALS IN THE ORDER THAT THEY LISTED ON YOUR AGENDA STARTING AT THE BOTTOM OF PAGE. FOURTEEN REGARDING THE FIRST PROPOSAL TO FIGHT ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND ONE TIME TO IMPLEMENT NEW FOSTER YOUTH ELIGIBILITY RULES. THE STUDENT AT COMMISSION HAS IDENTIFIED CHANGES IT MUST MAKE TO ITS CURRENT GRANT DELIVERY SYSTEM IN ORDER TO IMPLEMENT RULES CREATED AS PART OF LAST YEAR'S BUDGET PACKAGE. WE REVIEWED THIS REQUEST AND FIND IT TO BE REASONABLE. REGARDING THE SECOND PROPOSAL BY TWO HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND ON GOING INTO POSITIONS FOR INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT. YOU NEED COMMISSION HAS INDICATED THAT THEIR INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT UNIT HAS EXPERIENCED INCREASED WORKLOAD OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS. BASED ON OUR REVIEW OF THEIR DATA WE FIND THAT ONE ADDITIONAL POSITION WOULD LIKELY REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF OVERTIME THEIR EXISTING STAFF AND INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT UNIT ARE WORKING AND ALLOW THE COMMISSION. TO MAINTAIN ITS CURRENT LEVEL OF SERVICE. HOWEVER THE ADMINISTRATION'S INDICATED TO US THAT PART OF THE INTENT IN THIS PROPOSAL IS TO ALLOW THE INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT UNIT TO PROVIDE A HIGHER LEVEL OF SERVICE. IF THAT IS A LEGISLATIVE PRIORITY THE LEGISLATURE MAY WISH TO CONSIDER BOTH OF THE PROPOSED POSSESSIONS. IN DOING SO IT MAY ALSO WISH TO CONSIDER PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE THAT WOULD REQUIRE THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION REPORT ON THE ACTIVITIES OF ITS INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT UNIT. TO ENSURE THAT IT IS IN FACT HAVING THE INTENDED THE FACT. FINALLY REGARDING THE THIRD PROPOSAL TO FIVE SEVENTY THOUSAND ON GOING AND ONE POSITION TO SUPPORT THE EXECUTIVE OFFICE. THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION IS CONDUCTED A WORKLOAD ANALYSIS. ESTIMATING THE NUMBER OF HOURS EXECUTIVE OFFICE TEAM FANS ON ADMINISTRATIVE TASKS SUCH AS SCHEDULING MEETINGS AND PROCESSING TRAVEL REIMBURSEMENTS. BASED IN OUR REVIEW OF THE WORKLOAD ANALYSIS WE FIND THE REQUEST FOR ADDITIONAL ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT TO BE REASONABLE. THANK YOU CAPITA TAKEN QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU CHAIR DAVID OBRIEN STUDENT AID COMMISSION -- I JUST WANT -- TO ONCE AGAIN A CORE PRECISION TO THE MINISTRATION -- FOR UNDERSTANDING THE NEED HERE TO THE ONLY -- FOR THE SUPPORTIVE COMMENTS -- TO TO OFFER A SORT OF AN EDITORIAL POINT IF I MAY UM. WE'RE TO THIS UNIT COMMISSION FOR A FEW YEARS NOW WE ARE NOT BY ANY MEASURE AND OVERSTAFFED OVER FUNDED STATE BUREAUCRACY EVERY SINGLE ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES COMES IN EVERY DAY -- DEDICATED TO OUR MISSION WORKING HARD ON BEHALF OF STUDENTS AND AS OUR FINANCIAL AID SYSTEM CONTINUES TO TO BE A VERY COMPLEX. SORT OF MULTI FACETED SYSTEMS MEMBERS THIS COMMITTEE HAVE -- HAVE NOTED TODAY -- IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE BE ABLE TO WORK WITH OUR INSTITUTIONS AND OUR STUDENTS BOTH HIGH SCHOOL AND COLLEGE INSTITUTIONS AND OUR STUDENTS TO MAKE SURE THAT -- EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS OUR FINANCIALLY SYSTEM [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] OKAY. QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS [inaudible] ALL RIGHT. SING ON UNLESS WILL AGAIN HOLD THIS ISSUE OPEN. AND FOR PROCEED NOW ISSUE NUMBER FIVE THIS IS OUR BIG DISCUSSION ITEM FOR TODAY. THIS IS RELATED TO SOME REFORM IDEAS FOR THAT. CAL GRANT A MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM. WHICH AS WE KNOW -- SEVERAL ASSEMBLY MEMBERS OF PUTTING MYSELF AND MR MEDINA -- LEADING EFFORTS A FOCUS ON THIS THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS AND OF COURSE TODAY WE'LL TALK ABOUT THE BUDGET IMPLICATIONS. SO MISTER BRIAN GREAT THANK YOU PLEASE PROCEED. DAVID ARRIVE FOR CALIFORNIA TO NEW COMMISSION. ALL BY MY LONESOME UP HERE YES AND WAY I KNOW YOU'RE WE HAVE A NEW EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR SO WE DO JUST READING HERE IN THIS IS WE'RE LAST. TIME AT THE AT THE HELM OF THE INTERIM SO THANK YOU. YES MY YEARS THANK YOU -- CHAIR AND BEFORE THAT BEFORE YOU WALK THROUGH THE PROPOSAL'S HERE CAN YOU MAYBE JUST REMIND. THE PUBLIC IN THE COMMITTEE WHERE WE'VE BEEN THE LAST COUPLE YEARS AND HOW WE GOT HERE ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU. SO -- IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS IN PARTICULAR UNDER PREVIOUS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR LIPITOR CORTES ALKALI AND OUR CURRENT CHAIR LUNDY JOE SAY. THE STUDENT EIGHT COMMISSION WORKINGWITH PARTNERS SUCH AS THE LEGISLATURE STUDENT GROUPS AND OUR INSTITUTIONAL SIGNAL PARTNERS. HAS -- UNDERTAKEN SOME PRETTY COMPREHENSIVE STUDIES AND WORKSHOPS OF THE COMPLEXITIES OF OUR FINANCIAL AID SYSTEM AND LOOKING AT POTENTIAL MODELS OR WAYS TO OVERHAUL THE SYSTEM. TO REALLY OF MODERNIZE IT AND BRING IT IN LINE WITH WHAT A TWENTY FIRST CENTURY FINANCIAL AID SYSTEM SERVING THE STUDENTS OF TODAY WOULD LOOK LIKE AND RECOGNIZING THAT THE SYSTEM WE HAVE NOW -- AS AS STRONG AS IT IS IN CHAIR YOU'VE CALLED AT THE IN THE IN THE NATION I ABSOLUTELY BELIEVE THAT'S CORRECT. IS VERY MUCH -- BUILT FOR AN EARLIER TYPE OF STUDENT THE TYPE OF STUDENT WHO IS MORE LIKELY TO GO TO COLLEGE YOU'RE LIKELY AT A HIGH SCHOOL WHO IS MORE LIKELY TO GO DIRECTLY TO A FOUR YEAR INSTITUTION OR TWO INTO COMMUNITY COLLEGE WHO WAS. YOUR LIVING AT HOME AND MAYBE WORKING PART TIME AND THE FACT THAT MATTER IS OUR STUDENT POPULATION HAS CHANGED. IT'S IMPORTANT THAT OUR FINANCIAL AID SYSTEM SORT OF KEEP UP WITH THAT TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN MAKE THAT GOAL OF A HIGHER EDUCATION SOMETHING THAT'S AFFORDABLE. AND ACCESSIBLE FOR EVERY STUDENT. SO IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN AFTER DIRECTION FROM THE LEGISLATURE IN THE PREVIOUS YEAR'S BUDGET ACT WE COMMISSIONED A STUDY THAT THE CENTURY FOUNDATION RELEASED. CALLED -- GOTCHA FORGETTING THAT EVEN W. COMMISSIONED A STUDY BY THE CENTURY FOUNDATION A TEAM LED BY -- ROBERT CHAIRMAN AND IT WAS AN EXCELLENT REPORT THAT WAS RELEASED IN APRIL OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN THAT RECOMMENDED A SORT OF COST OF ATTENDANCE FOCUSED MODEL FOR FINANCIAL AID SO. BILL THE IDEA BEING THAT THE SYSTEM THE FINANCIAL AID SYSTEM SHOULD MAKE THE OVERALL COST OF ATTENDANCE SOMETHING THAT'S MANAGEABLE AND AFFORDABLEFOR EVERY STUDENT. NOT JUST FOCUS ON ENSURING THAT STUDENTS CAN FOR THEIR TUITION BECAUSE WE NOW -- AS THIS COMMITTEE HAS HEARD A MANY TIMES AND AS THE LEGISLATION THAT YOUR CO AUTHOR MISTER CHAIR -- FOCUSES ON THINGS LIKE HOUSING COSTS TRANSPORTATION COSTS TEXTBOOKS EDUCATIONAL SUPPLIES ETCETERA REALLY TO MAKE UP THE BULK OF STUDENTS TOTAL COST -- IN THE MODERN AGE -- AT CALIFORNIA INSTITUTIONS SO -- PURSUANT TO A STAFF REQUEST IN MANY DISCUSSIONS THAT WE HAVE HAD WITH YOUR STAFF AND WITH COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND LEGISLATIVE STAFF -- WHAT WE DID AT THE STERN THE COMMISSION IS PUT TOGETHER THIS DOCUMENT THAT I BELIEVE YOU HAVE IT SAYS CALIFORNIA STUDENT A COMMISSION COST ESTIMATES AT THE TOP? THE SORT OF LOOKS AT SOME OF THE BUDGET ACTIONS THAT COULD BE TAKEN -- IMMEDIATELY IF YOU WILL SO -- RATHER THAN -- IN LIEU OF THE LEGISLATION -- ASSEMBLY BILL THIRTEEN FOURTEEN OR THE OTHER CAL GRANT REFORM LEGISLATION OUT THERE -- TO THESE WERE SORT OF SOME THINGS THAT COULD BE DONE TO RIGHT AWAY IN THE CURRENT BUDGET ACT TO KIND OF KICK OFF -- FINANCIALLY REFORM IN CALIFORNIA SO HAPPY TO SORT OF GO THROUGH THIS DOCUMENT TALK ABOUT WHAT SOME OF THESE -- SOME OF THESE PROPOSALS ARE WITH THE DISCLAIMER OF COURSE IF I MAY OF THAT -- BUT THESE WERE PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES AND THAT THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT REPRESENT AN OFFICIAL POLICY PROPOSAL OR DOOR SPENT AT THE STUDENT A COMMISSION IS MADE. THE SENSE THE SCORING SOME OF THAT. THE WELL PUBLICIZED IDEAS THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT VERY MUCH SO CERTAINLY -- AND ALSO JUST ONE ANOTHER THIS IS NOT -- NOR IS THIS THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE OF VARIOUS BUDGET ACTIONS OUR CALVET REFORM I'M SECURE DEBATE THIS IS JUST SORT OF SOME OF THE I THINK -- COMMITTEE STAFF AND I WORK WERE JOKING THAT IS KIND OF LIKE THE OLD DAVID LETTERMAN TOP TEN IF YOU WILL OF FINANCIAL AID OR KIND OF SOME OF THE BIG TICKET ITEMS THAT WAS DAVID LETTERMAN ABOUT. THESE BOOKS ARE NOT AS OLD AND A YES. SO. HAPPY TO WALK THROUGH THIS. WITH INTERESTED YES PLEASE RIGHT. SO ONE OF THE ONE OF THE KEY COMPONENTS THAT WE HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING IN RECENT YEARS WITH REGARDS TO CAL GRANT. IS THE ACCESS WORK COMPONENT OF OUR CAL GRANT THE PROGRAM THIS IS THE STATE'S MAIN -- FINANCIAL AID AWARD THAT COVERS NON TUITION EXPENSES FOR LOW INCOME STUDENTS -- IT IS -- IT'S ACTUALLY THE ME THE ONLY CAL GRANT AWARD THAT COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS CAN RECEIVE SENSORS NO TUITION CHARGE FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND THE ECONOMY ACCESS THE WORD WHICH SERVES -- OVER A QUARTER OF A MILLION STUDENTS HAS NOT KEPT UP WITH INFLATION IT WAS FIRST INSTITUTED IN THE LATE NINETEEN SIXTIES AT NINE HUNDRED DOLLARS -- IN NINETEEN SIXTY TO NINETEEN SIXTY NINE DOLLARS SO WOULD BE WORTH MORE THAN SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR TODAY IF IT KEPT UP WITH INFLATION. IT'S CURRENTLY SET AT ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED FORTY EIGHT DOLLARS SO IT'S WORTH ABOUT A QUARTER OF WHAT IT WOULD BE SO WHAT WE DID IS WE JUST SORT OF LOOKED AT SOME COST ESTIMATES IF THE AWARD WERE TO BE INCREASED TO TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS. TO TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS NO ORDER THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS AND QUITE CANDIDLY MISTER CHAIR THIS IS A THIS IS NOT A LOW COST -- LOW LIFT ITEM EVEN INCREASING IT BY A FEW HUNDRED DOLLARS TO TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS WOULD COST A LITTLE OVER A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS -- IN ANNUAL FUNDS -- AND ABOUT THE WHAT'S DALY INCREASE YEAR OVER YEAR AS THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS RECEIVING THE AWARD INCREASES BUT AS I SAID THIS IS THE PRIMARY FORM OF NON TUITION SUPPORT MEANING SUPPORT. FOR TEXTBOOKS SUPPLIES LIVING EXPENSES AT CETERA THAT THE STATE PROVIDES THROUGH THE CAL GRANT PROGRAM. SO -- WE THINK IT WOULD PAY SIGNIFICANT DIVIDENDS BUT AGAIN -- NOT A LOW COST. MOVING ON SURE AND THE THIS WOULD BE FROM THIS. IS KIND OF GOING TO COMING TO THE END. THIS WOULD BE. THE MOST COSTLY I BELIEVE SO. YEAH OVERALLTHOUGH DEPENDING ON SOME OF THE SOME OF THE OPTIONS BUT YES BY AND LARGE. SO THE OTHER THING WE TALKED ABOUT AND THAT YOU MENTION AT THE BEGINNING OF THE HEARING -- CHAIR MCCARTY IS THE NOTION OF SORT OF CLOSING UP SOME OF THE GAPS IN OUR CURRENT STATE FINANCIAL AID SYSTEM -- AGAIN CAL GRANT BEING -- ARGUABLY THE MOST GENEROUS IN PROGRESS OF FINANCIAL AID SYSTEM IN THE COUNTRY THERE ARE STILL A LOT OF STUDENTS THAT ARE LEFT OUT THAT HAVE SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL NEED THAT -- IT CERTAINLY APPEARS WERE INTENDED TO BE SERVED BY THE CAL GRANT PROGRAM BUT THANKS TO SOME OF THESE CARD OUTSIDE OF IN BUILT IN OVER THE YEARS HAVE BEEN -- UNINTENTIONALLY LEFT OUT AND SO -- FOR EXAMPLE THANKS TO THE FACT THAT CAL GRANT A AND CAL GRANT BE HAVE DIFFERENT GPA REQUIREMENTS BUT ALSO DIFFERING INCOME CEILINGS A LOT OF STUDENTS -- WHO HAVE WHAT IN CALIFORNIA WOULD YOU KNOW NATION WIDE MIGHT BE CONSIDERED MIDDLE INCOME BUT IN CALIFORNIA -- HARDLY MIDDLE CLASS FIFTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS TO ABOUT A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN INCOME -- DON'T RECEIVE ANY CAL GRANT AT ALL EVEN THOUGH THEY MAY HAVE A GPA CLOSE TO THREE POINT NO THEY MAY GET INTO ONE OF OUR CS YOU WERE UC CAMPUSES ONE OF OUR QUALIFYING PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS. BUT BECAUSE OF THIS GAP DUE TO THE DIFFERENT GPA IN INCOME CEILINGS DON'T GET ANY CAL GRANT IT WHATSOEVER. AND SO THAT'S A CLOSE TO TEN THOUSAND STUDENTS STATEWIDE -- SIGNIFICANT NUMBER AND AT A COST OF ABOUT FORTY EIGHT MILLION -- OR ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN MILLION ON GOING WINNER NEW ALL STUDENTS ARE FACTORED IN THAT GAP COULD BE CLOSED UP SORT OF HELPING US BUILD A UNIFIED STREAMLINED. CAL GRANT SYSTEM. ANOTHER PROVISION THAT -- WAS -- THAT HAS BEEN A LAW FOR ABOUT FORTY YEARS NOW THAT WE DON'T KNOW DISCUSS MUCH BUT WITH IS SORT OF PART OF OUR VISION FOR UNIFIED CAL GRANT SYSTEM. IS A PROVISION IN OUR CAL GRANT BE CODE FOR YOU KNOW WHATEVER REASON SAYS THAT STUDENTS TO GET A CAL GRANT BE AND GO TO ONE OF OUR FOUR YEAR SCHOOLS THAT'S THE UC A CSU. OR A PRIVATE NONPROFIT OR FOR PROFIT INSTITUTION DON'T GET A TUITION AWARD IN THEIR FIRST YEAR THE GET IN YEARS TWO THREE OR FOUR BUT IN THEIR FIRST YEAR THEY ONLY GET THAT ACCESS THE WAR THAT SUPPORT FOR BOOKS AND SUPPLIES. AND AS FAR AS WERE ABLE TO TELL THAT WAS BUILT ON OUTDATED PROVISION OF LAW BACK IN THE DAY THAT ASSUME THAT LOW INCOME STUDENTS WOULD OVER WHEN WE GO TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE FIRST AND THEN THE ANSWER FOR NOW IS THAT A BETTER DEAL WHEN TUITION WAS LOWER. CERTAINLY PEOPLE MADE THE CHOICE TO ACTUALLY TRACK THAT BUT NOW BUT EVERY YEARS THAT I VISION HAS BECOME OUTDATED AND ARGUABLY GIVEN THE STATE'S YEAH OUT SUPPORT FOR LOW INCOME STUDENTS ATTENDING COLLEGE -- AN OFFENSIVE PROVISIONED YOUR TO HAVE -- IN OUR FINANCIAL AID SYSTEM ASSUMING THAT LOW INCOME STUDENTS WILL AUTOMATICALLY GO EXCLUSIVELY TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE. ARE THE THIRD NOT WORTHY QUOTE UNQUOTE OF GOING TO A FOUR YEAR INSTITUTION. SO THERE'S A KIND OF TO THE BIG YOU KNOW GAPS THAT WE TALK ABOUT OUR HOLES -- AGAIN BOTH OF WHICH CARRIED A SIGNIFICANT PRICE TAG OVER A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY TO CLOSE ON AND WE KNOW THAT IN THE CASE OF THAT CAL GRANT THE PROVISION THAT I JUST MENTIONED -- OUR PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS -- TO APPEAR BE COVERING MOST OF THE STUDENTS WITH THEIR INSTITUTIONALLY BASED FINANCIAL AID ON ANNUAL BASIS SO FORTUNATELY DOES NOT SEEM OF THERE'S A LOT OF STUDENTS IN THAT PARTICULAR PROVISION THAT ARE NOT GETTING THE TUITION SUPPORT. IT'S JUST THAT IT'S PART OF A VERY COMPLEX AND DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND SYSTEM WHEN THEY'RE TUITION SUPPORT IS COMING PARTLY FROM THE STATE PARTY FROM THE INSTITUTION AND THEN AFTER YOUR ONE IT'S WHICH IS FROM INSTITUTIONAL AID TO STATE A AND REALLY -- UNIFIED STREAMLINED SYSTEM MIGHT COVER TUITION FOR ALL STUDENTS FOR FOUR YEARS OKAY -- FINALLY ON THIS PAGE. TWO MORE PAGES -- ON PAGE TWO WE HAVE SOME -- COST ESTIMATES ARE INCREASING THE NUMBER OF COMPETITIVE CAL GRANT AWARDS AND SO WE JUST LOOK AT WHAT A COST PER AN EXTRA. FIVE THOUSAND AWARDS EVERY YEAR SO ADDING FIVE THOUSAND ADDITIONAL WORDS ABOUT ELEVEN MILLION AT THE CURRENT RATE BUT WE ALSO LOOK AT IF THE CAL GRANT. ACCESS THE WAR WERE TO BE INCREASED WHAT THAT WOULD COST BECAUSE THAT SORT OF HAS A COMPOUNDING EFFECT. SO AN ADDITIONAL IF YOU LOOK AT THE BOTTOM RIGHT AN ADDITIONAL -- FIVE THOUSAND AWARDS FOR YEARS OUT WOULD COST ABOUT TWENTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS AT THE THREE THOUSAND RATE. SO THOSE ARE DONE -- PER STAFF REQUEST TO SORT OF LOOK AT THE KIND OF COMPOUNDING -- COST SCORING. TOP OF PAGE -- THREE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT -- ARE COMMISSION HAS SUPPORTIVE IN RECENT YEARS HAS BEEN REMOVING BARRIERS TO STUDENTS GETTING A TRANSFER ENTITLEMENT CAL GRANT SO THE TRANSFER ENTITLEMENT CAL GRANT IN OUR VIEW. IS -- ONE OF THE SORT OF LESSER KNOWN IN MAY BE LESSER PUBLICIZED BUT REALLY -- MORE -- ADVANTAGEOUS PROVISIONS WERE FINANCIALLY SYSTEM THE TRANSFER ENTITLEMENT CAL GRANT SAYS TO ANY STUDENT BUT IF YOU MEET THE GPA REQUIREMENT CURRENTLY TWO POINT FOR YOUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND YOU TRANSFER PRIOR TO TURNING AGE TWENTY EIGHT AND APPLY -- YOU CAN GET A CAL GRANT FOR YOUR TWO YEARS AT THE FOUR YEAR INSTITUTION AFTER YOU TRANSFER THAT YOU'RE ENTITLED TO THAT AND THAT WILL COVER YOUR TUITION AND FEES AS WELL AS AN ADDITIONAL. AWARD FOR ACCESS COSTS IF YOU RECEIVE A CAL GRANT BE HOWEVER. IT HAS AN AGE LIMIT AGE TWENTY EIGHT AS YOU ARE REFERENCE EARLIER CHAIR SO. THAT LEAVES OUT QUITE A FEW STUDENTS SEVERAL THOUSAND STUDENTS WHO ATTEND COMMUNITY COLLEGE ENTRANCE FOR A LITTLE BIT LATER -- AGAIN SORT OF THAT NOTION OF THE TODAY'S STUDENT MEDIA DEMOGRAPHIC OF TODAY'S STUDENT SO WHAT WE'VE DONE IS SOME COST CALCULATIONS FOR IF WE WERE TO LIFT THAT AGE LIMIT TO AGE. THIRTY ABOUT THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS IT'S THIRTY FIVE BY FIFTY SEVEN MILLION. EACH FORTY ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE MILLION AND THEN JUST TO SAY NO AGE RESTRICTION ANY STUDENT WHO ATTENDS A CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE TRANSFERS MEETS OUR GPA AND ARE -- APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS WOULD GET THAT CAL GRANT AS AN ENTITLEMENT WHEN THEY TRANSFER. SO THAT'S KIND OF PART OF OUR GENERAL PRINCIPLE OF REMOVING BARRIERS TO ELIGIBILITY AND ACCESS TO CAL GRANT IS SOMETHING THAT WE'VE BEEN EMPHASIZING FOR RECENT YEARS IN THAT -- THE LEGISLATION THAT YOU MISTER DINNER CO AUTHORING EMPHASIZES AS WELL. FINALLY ON THIS PAGE THERE'S ONE MORE ITEM AFTER THE FINALLY ON PAGE THREE AND LEADING ON THE PAGE. FOR SOME OF A LOOK AT THE HIGH SCHOOL ENTITLEMENT WINDOW SO AS YOU MENTIONED EARLIER CHAIR THAT ENTITLEMENT VERSUS COMPETITIVE DISCUSSION. PRIMARILY HINGES ON HOW LONG IT HAS BEEN SINCE A STUDENT GRADUATE HIGH SCHOOL ONE OF THE MOST PROGRESSIVE STEPS THIS LEGISLATURE TOOK IN. TWO THOUSAND IN AN ACTING -- SENATE BILL SIXTEEN FORTY FOUR THE VASCONCELOS PARTICULAR TEASE CAL GRANT ACT WAS IN SAYING THAT ANY STUDENT WHO'S WITHIN ONE YEAR OF GRADUATE HIGH SCHOOL IS ENTITLED TO A CALDERON AWARD. IF THEY APPLY ON TIME MEET THE GPA AND INCOME REQUIREMENTS HOWEVER AGAIN AS WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING FOR MORE STUDENTS ARE. FOR YOU KNOW OFTEN PERFECTLY VALID REASONS TAKING A LITTLE LONGER TO ATTEND COLLEGE OR ATTENDING A LITTLE BIT LATER INTO THEIR TWENTIES OR LATER. AND SO WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT AND FOR THOSE STUDENTS THERE PRIMARILY SERVE BY THE COMPETITIVE CAL GRANT PROGRAMS SINCE -- THAT IS -- THAT'S THE STATE'S PRIMARY VEHICLE FOR SERVING THE QUOTE UNQUOTE ADULT LEARNER POPULATION SO WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT IT WOULD MAKE SENSE TO SORT OF ADD SOME TIME TO THAT WINDOW SAY. CAL GRANT TO ENTITLEMENT FOR TWO YEARS AFTER HIGH SCHOOL THREE YEARS AFTER HIGH SCHOOL FIVE YEARS OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL AND THIS ACTUALLY WILL WOULD CUT INTO THE COMPETITIVE CAL GRANT PROGRAM AND IF YOU'RE A REDUCE THAT SORT OF PRESSURE. AND DEMAND ON THE COMPETITIVE CAL GRANT PROGRAM BY PROVIDING MORE TIME FOR THE STUDENTS TO GET ENTITLEMENT CALDERON. TO ADD ONE YEAR TO MAKE IT COVER AN ANTI ONE FOR TWO YEARS AT A HIGH SCHOOL WOULD COST APPROXIMATELY THIRTY SIX MILLION. TO MAKE IT THREE YEARS GOES UP SIGNIFICANTLY NINETY SEVEN MILLION AND TO MAKE IT IN TIME FOR FIVE YEARS OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL YOU SEE ON PAGE. FOUR TWO HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN MILLION BUT AGAIN THAT WOULD IN TURN REDUCE SOME OF THE PRESSURE IN DEMAND ON THE COMPETITIVE CAL THAT PROGRAM BECAUSE THOSE OF THE STUDENTS THAT ARE PRIMARILY SURVEY THAT PROGRAM NOW. SO IT'S KIND OF AN EITHER OR VERSUS INCREASING THE NUMBER COMPETITIVE CAL GRANTS AVAILABLE OR INCREASING THE ENTITLEMENT WINDOW OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL -- FINALLY IN THIS DOCUMENT WE TALKED ABOUT -- PROVIDING ADDITIONAL CAL GRANT ELIGIBILITY FOR STUDENTS TAKING SUMMER COURSE WORK A. K. A. SUMMER CAL GRANT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS IN ASSEMBLY BILL. THIRTEEN FOURTEEN THAT HAS BEEN DISCUSSED FOR MANY YEARS NOW THAT -- OUR PARTNERS AND FRIENDS AT THE STUDENT ASSOCIATIONS ARE PROMOTING HEAVILY THIS YEAR ESSENTIALLY RIGHT NOW STUDENT WHO ATTENDS COLLEGE AND TAKE SUMMER COURSEWORK THEY CAN USE THEIR CAL GRANT FOR THE SUMMER COURSES. BUT IT DRAWS DOWN FROM THE LIFETIME ELIGIBILITY SO YOU HAVE A SITUATION WHERE STUDENTS ARE TAKING THOSE SUMMER COURSES GETTING CAL GRANT TO SUPPORT THEM BECAUSE THEY WANT TO TRAIN GRADUATE WITHIN FOUR YEARS. BUT THEN THEY MIGHT GET TO THAT FINAL SEMESTER THEIR SENIOR YEAR AND OOPS YOU'RE OUT OF CAL GRANT. YOU HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO COVER WITH LOANS WORKING EXTRA WHICH CAN ACTUALLY PROLONG SORT OF HAVE THE PERVERSE EFFECT OF PROLONGING THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT IT TAKES THEM TO GRADUATE. SO -- OUR COMMISSION IS IN SUPPORT OF THIS AND WE'RE WORKING WITH PARTNERS -- IN THE STERN ASSOCIATIONS AND WITH ASSEMBLYMEMBERS MEDINA MCCARTY AND THEY'RE LEGISLATION TO PROVIDE WHAT WE CALL BONUS ELIGIBILITY FOR STUDENTS TAKING SUMMER COURSE WORK SO THAT. THEY CAN TAKE A CERTAIN NUMBER SUMMER TERMS USE A CAL GRANT GET THAT FINANCIAL AID HOPEFULLY GRADUATE ON TIME AND NOT BE PENALIZED SORT OF ON THE BACK AND FOR THAT. THAT'S IT FOR THIS -- DOCUMENTS HERE IN MEMBERS THAT SORT OF SCORES SOME OF THESE PROPOSALS -- CALDERON AUGMENTATIONS THAT WE HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING THERE ARE SEVERAL OTHERS SOME SORT OF NO COST -- LOW LIFT CAL GRANT REFORMS THAT WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING SUCH AS INCLUDING OUR AB FIVE FORTY STUDENTS AND DREAMERS IN THE COMPETITIVE CAL GRANT PROGRAM WHICH IS NOT IN AND OF ITSELF CARRY. A COST BECAUSE THE NUMBER OF COMPETITIVE AWARDS CAPPED -- THAT WERE HAPPY TO DISCUSS AND CONTINUE TO WORK WITH YOU ON OKAY. THANK YOU FOR PROVIDING US WITH THE ROAD MAP SO I JUST HAVE THE PLAN THAT WE'RE GOING TO A TOP TRACK HERE. IN MY LITTLE NOTES SO. I CAN'T TELL YOU JUST YET DOW BUT HOPEFULLY THAT -- LEDGER THE MAY REVISE GONNA LOOK ATTRACTIVE WILL BE ABLE. TO TO TO PICK AND CHOOSE FROM THE MENU HERE. TO REALLY STEP IT UP WITH OUR FINANCIALLY THE ONE THING THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE ON HERE. THE WHICH IS IMPORTANT TO US IS THESE -- ADAM AWARDS. AND SO DO YOU HAVE ANY. ANALYSIS AS FAR AS HOW MUCH THAT IS FOR THE CAL GRANT MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP FOR THAT. FOR THE NON TUITIONS CERTAINLY AND AND WE HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING THAT WITH COMMITTEE STAFF AS WELL THAT WAS A LITTLE BIT HARDER TO SCORE -- BECAUSE IT SORT OF DEPENDS ON THE I THINK WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IS THE NOTION THAT WE WOULD CONSOLIDATE CAL GRANT AB AND C. A MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP HAVE ONE CAL GRANT TO SOME. AND HAVE THE WORDS KIND OF TAPERED DOWN AS THE STUDENTS INCOME GOES UP -- IF I RECALL CORRECTLY AND HELP YOU SOME SUPPORT FOR NON TUITION EXPENSES THE JUST SORT OF GOES SCALED DOWN AS AS THE STUDENT INCOME OR NEED YOU KNOW YEAH RACES -- NOPE WOULD WANT TO TAPER DOWN THAT SAID POLICY DISCUSSION BUT HER POTENTIALLY TAPER AT TAPERED UP. TO COVER THE THAT THE NON TUITION COSTS SPECIALLY FOR THE LOWEST INCOME. SURE YEAH AND WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THAT I THINK IT JUST DEPENDS ON THE MODEL THAT'S USED BUT WE CAN CONTINUE WORKING WITH ALL OF THE ROUTE. THAT WIND THE THE BALLPARK -- SO ARE YOU ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT HAVING LIKE -- LIKE SETTING THAT NON TUITION AWARD WILL BE CALLED THE CAL GRANT BE AXIS WARD AT ABOUT LIKE LIKE UP YEARS AGO WE DID THERE ARE. DEBT FREE COLLEGE SURE GRANTS WHERE'D. I THINK IT WAS ROUGHLY. FIFTY THREE THOUSAND AND EIGHT THOUSAND THE AVERAGE CAL GRANT RECIPIENT WILL RECEIVE. THIS AMOUNT IN ADDITION EVERY YEAR -- FOR FOR NON TUITION COSTS. SO TO DO THAT SORT OF SYSTEM WHICH I THINK REPRESENTS A PRETTY COMPREHENSIVE OVERHAUL. WOULD BE ROUGHLY IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF ONE AND A HALF TO TWO BILLION AND THAT'S A PRETTY COMPREHENSIVE OVERHAUL THAT INVOLVES IF I'M IF I'M UNDERSTANDING CORRECTLY THE SORT OF MODEL WHERE THERE'S A EXPECTED STUDENT CONTRIBUTION% FROM WORKER LOANS. AND THEN FEDERAL INSTITUTIONAL STATED WILL COMBINE TO MEET THE REMAINDER OF THE COST OF ATTENDANCE AND FOR THOSE LOW INCOME HIGHER NEED STUDENTS THAT GRANT WILL BE. A LITTLE HIGHER TO ENSURE THAT THEIR COST OF ATTENDANCE IS COVERED I'VE SEEN VARIOUS MODELS OF THAT IN THE ONE AND A HALF TO TWO BILLION DOLLAR RANGE. YES THAT'S OBVIOUSLY THE LARGEST -- DOLLAR SIGN ON THESE PROPOSAL SO IF YOU ADD UP. ALL THESE PROPOSALS AND AND LET'S SAY -- THE MOST COST EFFICIENT. CHOICE ON HERE AND SOME OF THE ONES WE HAVE MULTIPLE OPTIONS IS WHO IS WITHIN THE LOW COUPLE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR RANGE SACKED. THAT'S THE ESSENTIALLY VIABLE FEET. IF YOU DID A A MULTI YEAR IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT. SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I THINK WE WILL BE EVALUATING I GUESS I I KNOW SOME MY COLLEAGUES HE HAS SOME QUESTIONS HERE. TO ABOUT ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT I I'VE ALWAYS GRAPPLE WITH. AND IT'S IT'S KIND OF BACK TO THE FIRST ISSUE. IS IF YOU IF YOU HAVE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF STUDENTS WHO ARE WHO ARE IN. THEY HAVE A ARE YOU BETTER OFF GIVING THEM BETTER EIGHT ARE HELPING THE STUDENTS WHO DIDN'T GET A IN THE FIRST PLACE. IN OTHER WORDS WE HAVE WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO HAVE A CAL GRANT. AWARD MAYBE IT SAID INSUFFICIENT ARE INFERIOR WORD THE ACCESS GRANTS AREN'T LOW ENOUGH WE DON'T COVER. TUITION THE FIRST YEAR BUT THEY'RE GETTING AID AND SO MANY STUDENTS ARE GETTING A AT ALL. THE COMPETITIVE -- STE THE US THE STUDENTS FOR PARTICULAR PEOPLE IN THAT DONNA HOLD SO FOR SO. WHO WHAT WHAT'S THE BIGGEST? BANG FOR YOUR BUCK IF YOU COULD -- OBVIOUSLY WE WANT TO DO BOTH AND I ASKED. LAST YEAR WITH THE TO THIS QUESTION AND SHE ONE ANSWER SO IF YOU HAD. YOU KNOW A COUPLE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS HE IS CHOOSE ONE OF THE OTHER. WHAT WOULD YOU DO? IT'S GOING TO SOUND LIKE I'M HUNTING BUT WITH THE NEW EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR STARTING TOMORROW THIS THIS IS EITHER MIGHT. MY CHANCE OR I SHOULD KEEP MY MOUTH SHUT BUT I WOULD SAY IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO BE AN EITHER OR I WOULD SAY THAT -- HE IN DISCUSSIONS WE'VE HAD WITH STAKEHOLDERS THIS DOESN'T REPRESENT LIKE AN OFFICIAL POSITION OF COMMISSIONS TAKEN BUT DISCUSSIONS OF HAVE A STAKEHOLDERS I THINK THAT INTERNALLY WE HAVE INCREASINGLY COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT. IT DOES NEED TO BE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT WE WE DO NEED TO PROVIDE BOTH MORE AID. FOR STUDENTS WHO ARE ALREADY IN THE SYSTEM BUT WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE A WHOLE LOT OF STUDENTS THAT AREN'T EVEN IN DUTIES ELIGIBILITY. THERE IS WE CREATED AND ON THAT LATTER POINT TO THE ELIGIBILITY BEARERS I THINK THAT'S WHERE YOU SEE -- YOU SEE A LOT OF COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS WHO ARE SERVED AS WELL BY THE CURRENT CAL GRANT ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA. AND THAT TO A LARGE EXTENT IS WHY -- I THINK WE'D LIKE TO SEE. YOU KNOW WHETHER IT'S FIFTY FIFTY OR OR CLOSE TO FIFTY FIFTY BUT SOME SOMETHING CLOSE EQUAL ATTENTION PAID TO OF BOTH THE BREATH VERSUS DEPTH THE IDEA THAT. WE'D LIKE TO SEE MORE STUDENTS GET INTO THE FINANCIAL AID SYSTEM AND GET CAL GRANT TO BEGIN WITH BUT WOULD ALSO LIKE TO SEE THOSE THAT ARE GETTING IT. PARTICULARLY THOSE THAT HAVE THE HIGHEST NEEDHAM HEIGHTS COST GET MORE EIGHT YEAH BUT THE FLIP SIDE OF THAT IF YOU TRY TO BE A LITTLE BIT. TO A LOT OF PEOPLE YOU'RE NOTHING TO NOBODY. AND SO AND THERE'S THERE ARE SOME PIECES THAT YOU COULD JUST DO THE WHOLE THING. LIKE THAT THAT THAT THAT. DOES NOT HOLD THE STUDENTS TO HAVE INCOMES BETWEEN FIFTY AND A HUNDRED GRAND THAT HE PAYS JUST BELOW THREE POINT OUT. TO TO CLOSE THAT HOLE IS WHAT. FORTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS. AND THEN THAT THE SUMMER SCHOOL -- PIECES LESS THAN TEN MILLION DOLLARS AND WE'RE NOT SURE IF THAT ACCURATE NUMBERS ON THAT. AND SO -- YOU KNOW TO INCREASING THE WINDOW FOR TWO YEARS FOR ENTITLEMENTS THIRTY SIX MILLION CELL. WOULD YOU WOULD YOU ADVISE DOING SOME OF THOSE ALL OF THEM AS OPPOSED TO SPREADING THEM OUT IF WE IF WE DIDN'T HAVE THE AMOUNT TO DO A ALL TO GO ALL THE WAY. IN IN THAT. OUT OF THE GATE. I THINK THAT WOULD BE. I THINK THAT'S A THAT THAT WOULD BE A FAIR ASSESSMENT YEAH THAT WE HAVE THERE THERE ARE CERTAINLY SOME STEPS THAT -- IN THE INTEREST OF PURSUING A SYSTEMIC BEYOND OVERHAUL OF A FINANCIALLY SYSTEM. THAT WE WOULD PROBABLY RECOMMEND BE DONE ALL AS ONE BUT THAT AGAIN IS A POLICY CALL AND AS I THINK WE DISCUSSED IN FEBRUARY THE FINANCIAL AID HEARING. TO A LARGE EXTENT IT ALSO DEPENDS ON THE ON THE GOAL THE ON THE LEGISLATURE'S GOALS AND IF THE GOAL IS. TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF DEBT YOUNG STUDENTS GRADUATE WITH IS IF THE GOAL IS TO GET MORE STUDENTS YOU KNOW TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD IN A TOWN CALLED TO BEGIN WITH -- I THINK THAT -- OUR RECOMMENDATION WOULD BE TO ONLY START SOME DISCUSSION OF WHAT THOSE GOALS ARE AND THEN SORT OF FIGURE OUT WHICH PIECES OF THE FINANCIALLY REFORM WOULD BE MOST EFFECTIVE IN MEETING THOSE. WELL I I THINK OUR GOAL IS TWO FOLD AS YOU SAID EARLIER WE HAVE THIS CAL GRANT PROGRAM WHICH IS ONE OF THE AND THESE OF THE NATION AS FAR AS OUR OUR EFFORTS IS NEARLY TWO BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. WE SPENT ON ON FINANCIAL AID BUT WE NEED TO REALIZE TWO THINGS THAT. WON THE AWARDS JUST AREN'T WHAT THEY THEY USED TO BE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE TOTAL COST OF INSTRUCTION THAT. WE LOOK AT BOOKS AND HOUSING AND FOOD AND TRANSPORTATION. THE TUITION IS JUST A PIECE OF THE PUZZLE YESTERDAY I WAS AT THAT AT THE CSU AND WORK TWO THIRDS OF THE STUDENTS THERE. GET SOME TYPE OF FINANCIAL AID TO PAY FOR TUITION BUT THEY'RE STILL STRAPPED THEY HAD THE FOOD PANTRIES WHICH IS UNBELIEVABLE WE HAVE FOOD PANTRIES ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES NOW YEAH. ONE IN TEN STUDENTS AT CS YOUR HOMELESS WERE DEBATING A BILL TO ALLOW COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS TO SLEEP IN PARKING LOTS. MANY. THAT THAT'S UNBELIEVABLE TO GO BACK TEN OR FIFTEEN YEARS AND SO. I THINK WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE FINANCIAL AID MODEL TO COVER THESE NON TUITION COSTS SO. STREAMY PROPOLIS ON THAT ON THE ADD ON A WORDS TO TO GO TO THE BENCH WE GET TO A PATH WHERE YOU CAN GRADUATE DEBT FREE. NOT FREE CALLS BUT DEBT FREE. BUT THE BUT THE OTHER THIS ISSUE TOO IS THAT THERE'S TOO MANY STUDENTS WHO JUST. MISSED OUT AND WE'VE BEEN TWEAKING THIS GREAT CAL GRANT PROGRAM FOR DECADES BUT EVERY TWEAK IS. CARVING PEOPLE OUT AND AS AS THAT MR DONNA SAID EARLIER YOU HAVE TO HAVE THAT. AT PHD IN FINANCIAL AID TO UNDERSTAND THIS WHEN WHEN WE LITERALLY. DRAFTED THE BILL. TO REFORM THE CAL GRANT PROPOSAL IT TOOK PLEDGE COUNCIL MULTIPLE LAYERS IN A MONTH. TO FIGURE IT OUT FINALLY SAID YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS SCRAP IT AND START FROM SCRATCH BECAUSE WE HAVE SO MANY. CARVE OUTS AND ADD ONS IN THIS PERSON BUT NOT THAT PERSON THAT. AND SO IT JUST IT -- I KNOW WE'VE TRIED OVER THE YEARS TO EXPAND FINANCIALLY BUT WE MADE ONE MORE COMPLICATED INTO WERE STILL. A SQUEEZING OUT TOO MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE WHO ARE ELIGIBLE AND NEEDY SO -- THIS IS CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT. WE'RE GONNA ATTEMPTED TO STEP UP IN OUR FINAL BUDGET AND AND ATTEMPT TO IMPLEMENT OVER A NUMBER YEARS WE THINK YOU KNOW EVEN OUT. BY JUST KIND OF TIGHT WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO START TO START THIS YEAR SO SO WITH THAT LET ME I TURNED OVER A FIRST TO MISTER O'DONNELL. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AGAIN I THINK YOU BRING UP THE MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP I HOPE WE DON'T TAPER DOWN ANYTHING -- A FOR ANY LEVEL -- IN PARTICULAR -- TALK ABOUT THE THE MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP THING THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT. BECAUSE I AGAIN I I I ASSURE YOU THE FRUSTRATION ON HEARING. OUT IN THE COMMUNITY WITH REGARD. TO TO TO THE NEEDS OF THE MIDDLE CLASS WHICH I DON'T THINK THE STATE PAYS ENOUGH ATTENTION. TO PRETTY EITHER WAY -- I JUST WANNA GET A LITTLE PRACTICAL -- MY MY MY MY BACKGROUND AS CLASSROOM TEACHER I WOULD ACTUALLY HAVE STUDENTS. I SIGNED UP FOR THE FAST FOR IN MY CLASSROOM -- I WAS SOCIAL STUDIES IT WASN'T MY PURVIEW BUT I THE COUNCIL WOULD COME IN AND THEY DO HAVE THAT THE STUDENTS -- AND IT WAS AN INTERESTING EXPERIENCE -- BUT SO SO AFTER STUDENTS SENSE OF HER FAST FOLK WHO. WHOSE RESPONSIBILITY IS IT. TO EDUCATE -- ANY PARTICULAR STUDENT -- ABOUT WHAT FINANCIAL% AID MIGHT BE AVAILABLE WOULD THAT BE THE DUTY OF THE SCHOOL COUNSELOR WOULD BE THE FAMILY WOULD BE THE STUDENT WOULD BE A POTENTIALCOLLEGE. IS IS THERE ANY MANDATED PLACE OR IS IT JUST KIND OF A RIGHT IT'S IT'S KIND OF A A NETWORK -- OF OF FOLKS SO -- I WOULD SAY THAT WHEN THE STUDENT IS A WHEN THEY'RE STILL IN HIGH SCHOOL IT WOULD BE IT WOULD PRIMARILY BE SOMEBODY THE HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL HAS -- COUNSELOR THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IN ONE OF THE PREVIOUS ISSUES WE DISCUSSED HERE THAT WE'RE SEEKING MORE STAFFING FOR THE COMMISSION IS THAT WE DO WORKSHOPS ABOUT FORTY WORKSHOPS A YEAR RETRAIN HIGH SCHOOL COUNSELORS. AND BOB BECAUSE THAT'S HOW COMPLEX OUR FINANCIAL AID SYSTEM IS THAT WE O OUT WE TRAIN HIGH SCHOOL COUNCILS IT'S ALL THE WORKSHOPS WHERE WE GO THROUGH EVERY LINE OF THE FAST SO WITH THEM TO GO THROUGH ALL THE CHANGES THAT HAVE BEEN MADE -- TO MAKE SURE THEY UNDERSTAND HERE CAN'T CAN'T COMMUNICATE IT TO STUDENTS AND FAMILIES. SO YEAH THE HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL PROBABLY PRIMARILY THE COUNSELOR -- CERTAINLY THE STUDENT A COMMISSION WE PUT ON OVER THOUSAND CASH FOR COLLEGE WORKSHOPS HERE WHICH ARE FREE ALL THROUGHOUT THE STATE EVERY REGION OF THE STATE -- WHERE WE DO OUR BEST TO EDUCATE STUDENTS AND FAMILIES ABOUT FINANCIAL AID -- AS WELL AS THROUGH OUR CAL SO PROGRAM TO UP IF I TARGETED SERVICES -- TO LOW INCOME STUDENTS -- AND SORT OF FIRST GENERATION STUDENTS AND THEN. WHEN THE STUDENT GETS TO THE COLLEGE CAMPUS THERE'S A FINANCIAL AID OFFICE ON THE CAMPUS -- WHICH IS USUALLY THEIR FIRST DIRECT POINT OF CONTACT WE HAVE A CALL CENTER TO STUDENT A COMMISSION BUT PRIMARILY ONCE THEY'RE ON THE CAMPUS IT'S THEIR FINANCIAL AID OFFICER ON THE CAMPUS WHO UNDERSTANDS THE SYSTEM -- OF THE BEST SO IT IS SORT OF A NETWORK OF DIFFERENT AND IT. IT'S ALL REFLECTED OFF OF THE FASTER. YEAH THE FASTER THE CALIFORNIA DREAM ACT APPLICATION IF THEY'RE AN ELIGIBLE AB FIVE FORTY STUDENTS SO WHEN THEY DON'T DO HAS FOR THAT'S WHAT THAT'S WHAT THEY FILL OUT BECAUSE OF THEIR MAYBE THE DOCTOR CORRECTION THAT YET YES -- IT'S SO SO IS THERE IS THERE ONE OF SO THAT IT'S A MALE THEM IT'S DONE IT'S EMAIL TO THEM HOW DO THEY GET THE INFORMATION ABOUT. WHAT'S AVAILABLE TO THEM -- IT JUST SORT OF DEPENDS ON THEIR THERE'S NO UNIFORM SYSTEM I THINK FOR NOTIFYING OR DOING OUTREACH TO STUDENTS THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE CONSTANTLY LOOKING AT ITS WASTE OF SORT OF BETTER IMPROVE THAT COMMUNICATION. BUT REALLY -- IT IT USUALLY I BELIEVE MY EXPERIENCE WILL HAPPEN AT THE HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL FIRST -- THAT THEY FIND THAT OUT AND THEY CAN THE FAST IS AVAILABLE IT'S FREE IT'S AVAILABLE ONLINE -- LIKE I SAID THEY CAN COME TO ONE OF OUR CASH FOR COLLEGE WORKSHOPS BUT I DON'T THINK I THINK IT JUST SORT OF DEPENDS ON THE RESOURCES THE SCHOOL HAS THE THE AREA THE STATE THERE AND AT CENTER AS TO WHEN AND WHERE THEY GET THE INFORMATION. SO IS THERE -- IS THERE LIKE A WEBSITE THEY WOULD GO TO THE TYPE AND SOMETIME A NUMBER AND THEY TAKE. PAPA BAM THIS IS WHAT IS AVAILABLE TO ME BASED ON MY FAST FOR INFORMATION YES -- MOSTLY YES YES SIR THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION WE HAVE HISTORICALLY HOUSED -- AND THAT PRICE CALCULATOR IS THE OFFICIAL TERM THE USE IN FINANCIAL AID -- STATEWIDE -- CURRENTLY WORKING ON REVAMPING THAT BUT EVERY COLLEGE ALSO HAS A NET PRICE CALCULATOR AVAILABLE ON THEIR WEBSITE THAT SORT OF DOES A VERY ROUGH ESTIMATE IF YOU TYPE IN YOUR SITUATION YOUR FAMILY HOUSEHOLD SIZE. INCOME THINGS LIKE THAT AND AN ATTEMPT TO GET KIND OF A ROUGH BREAKDOWN OF THE TYPICAL COST AS WELL AS THE FINANCIALLY THAT WOULD LIKELY BE AVAILABLE TO A TYPICAL STUDENT THAT SITUATION. MITCHELL WORKING ON A STATE WIDE ONE I THINK WE'D LIKE TO SEE ULTIMATELY THAT WOULD ANY STUDENT IN CALIFORNIA GO TO OUR WEBSITE AND GET THAT INFORMATION FROM US I THINK THAT'S A PART I THINK THAT'S THAT'S DEFINITELY POSITIVE AS AS AS MISTER CHAIR TO CONTEMPLATE SOME OF THE CHANGES. I HOPE THAT'S PART OF THE DISCUSSION AND ACTUALLY THERE'S OTHER CHANGES THAT THAT THE COMMISSION HAS OR YOU HAVE. STUDENTS CERTAINLY HELP THOSE WILL BE INCLUDED IN ANY POTENTIAL EFFORT TO TO STREAM LIKE THIS AND MAKE IT MORE. UNDERSTANDABLE THANK YOU MR MEDINA. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE THIS MORNING -- IMPORTANT TOPIC -- TO A MISTER DONALD'S. HOW STUDENTS FIND OUT I I REMEMBER -- YEAR TWO YEARS AGO -- A. B. FIVE FORTY STUDENTS WERE NOT -- APPLYING AS MUCH FILLING OUT -- THE FINANCIAL AID AND I KNOW THAT THAT. LET YOU KNOW CAUCUS TOOK PART IN THE OUT REACH MEDIA OUT READ SO I THINK THOSE KIND OF THINGS ARE. ARE ARE VERY GOOD -- TO THE TO THE QUESTION OF WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME IF YOU COULD TELL ME. WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME THAT WE TRY TO OVERALL? OVERHAUL THE ENTIRE -- STUDENT -- EIGHT PACKAGES SURE -- I BELIEVE I WOULD SAY THAT YOU KNOW IT THERE THERE HAVE BEEN SOME SIGNIFICANT CHANGES OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP WAS ADDED. SEVERAL YEARS AGO -- THE CALIFORNIA DREAM ACT WAS ENACTED IN TWENTY ELEVEN BUT I WOULD SAY THAT THE LAST SORT OF MAJOR SYSTEMIC OVER HALLWAYS IN TWO THOUSAND THE PASSAGE OF THE VASCONCELOS -- ORTIZ BUT YOU CAN CAL GRANT US SENATE BILL SIXTEEN FORTY FOUR WHICH CREATED THE ENTITLEMENT PROGRAM HAS GONE TRANSFER ENTITLEMENT PROGRAMS TO IT'S BEEN ALMOST TWENTY YEARS CORRECT. AND THEN TO SOMETHING THAT -- THE CHAIR MCCARTY ALLUDED TO THE THE COMPLEXITY OF IT. WHICH I I I HEAR A LOT -- ALSO A HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER BEEN TO SOME OF THOSE CASH. FOR CLLEGE -- WORKSHOPS WITCHER ARE ARE VERY GOOD. DO DO WE ENVISION IN THIS -- AND AND WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO PROPOSE A SYSTEM THAT THAT GETS AWAY WITH SOME OF ALL THE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES AND TRIES -- TO MAKE IT MORE USER FRIENDLY AND AND PERHAPS SIMPLER. ABSOLUTELY I THINK -- FROM THE COMMISSION AND WORKING WITH -- THAT EXCELLENT STAFF YOUR POLICY COMMITTEE ON OFFICE STAFF IN THE BUDGET COMMITTEE STAFF -- WE HAVE CONSISTENTLY BEEN SPEAKING ABOUT IN SUPPORTING THE IDEA OF A STREAMLINED SORT OF ONE CAL GRANT SYSTEM -- FOR LACK OF A BETTER TERMINOLOGY THERE WILL STILL BE COMPLEXITIES FINANCIAL AID. IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO GET AWAY FROM SOME OF THE COMPLEXITIES BECAUSE THERE'S MULTIPLE LAYERS FEDERAL LATER STATED THERE'S A PROVIDED BY THE INSTITUTION. SO BUT AS A COLLEAGUE OF MINE LIKES TO SAY. IN OUR IDEAL WORLD WE WOULD PUT AS MUCH OF THAT COMPLEXITY BEHIND THE CURTAIN AS POSSIBLE SO THE STUDENTS AND FAMILIES DON'T NEED. TO SEE THIS DETAILED BREAKDOWN OF THE DIFFERENT COMPONENTS OF CAL GRANT APPELLATE RAN IN INCOME AN EXPECTED FAMILY CONTRIBUTION THAT THE THAT FROM THE STUDENT PERSPECTIVE -- THEY JUST NEED TO PROVIDE A SMALL AMOUNT OF INFORMATION AND THEY WOULD IDEALLY IMMEDIATELY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE ELIGIBLE FOR AND HOW TO GET IT SO YOU YOU WOULDN'T BE APPLYING. FOR YOU KNOW A. BE COMPETITIVE WE'RE TRYING TO WORK WITH WE WOULD IDEALLY LIKE TO STUDENT TO NOT EVEN HAVE TO KNOW THOSE TERMS -- IF AT ALL POSSIBLE TO JUST KNOW THAT THERE'S A CAL GRANT PROGRAM OUT THERE THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- BELIEVES IN THEM AND WANTS TO INVEST IN THEIR SUCCESS -- IN HIGHER EDUCATION. SO HOPEFULLY AT THE END OF THE DAY IT WILL BE MORE USER FRIENDLY AND AN ABSOLUTE MORE. SIMPLIFY ABSOLUTELY AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE LEGISLATION ESTIMABLE THIRTEEN FOURTEEN AND VISIONS. THANK YOU [inaudible] OKAY. ALREADY THIS IS SOMETHING WE'RE GOING -- TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON AND AND THAT WE THINK BRING BACK A PROPOSAL TO VOTE ON DURING THE MAY REVISE BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY -- YEAH THANKS FOR YOUR WORK IN AND STEPPING UP I KNOW THAT STUDENTS ACROSS -- CALIFORNIA ASKING US TO FIX FINANCIAL AID AND THIS IS THIS IS -- A BIG PIECE OF THE PUZZLE THAT WE'RE GONNA. LOOK AT DOING THIS YEAR THANK YOU THANK YOU. A WILL HOLD THIS ISSUE OPEN -- WITH THAT WE WILL PROCEED NOW TO THE ITEMS WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE LIBRARY. PLEASE COME UP. LIBRARY TEAM OKAY ISSUE NUMBER. ONE THAT CHAIRMAN CHRIS FERGUSON WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE CALIFORNIA STATE LIBRARY SERVES A CRITICAL ROLE IN STATE GOVERNMENT BY SERVING AT THE CENTRAL REFERENCE AND RESEARCH LIBRARY. FOR THE GOVERNOR AND LEGISLATURE ADDITIONALLY THE STATE LIBRARY PROVIDES CRITICAL ASSISTANCE AND DISTRIBUTES FEDERAL FUNDS TO THE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FOUR LIBRARY JURISDICTIONS IN OVER TWELVE HUNDRED LIBRARIES ACROSS THE STATE -- OVERALL THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET REPRESENTS OVER A THIRTY MILLION DOLLAR -- BUDGET GENERAL FUND BUDGET FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE LIBRARY AND THE TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY FISCAL YEAR -- FOR THE FIRST ISSUE -- THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROVIDES ONE MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME TO SUPPORT THE LUNCH AT THE LIBRARY PROGRAM -- THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA STATE LIBRARY -- IT TO LOCAL LIBRARY WHICH IS A GRANT PROGRAM FOR LOCAL LIBRARY JURISDICTIONS -- THE GOAL IS TO OF THE THE INVESTMENT IS TO ASSIST LOCAL LIBRARIES AND SETTING UP -- MEAL LUNCH PROGRAMS TO DRAW DOWN -- FEDERAL FUNDING TO SUPPORT THE ACTUAL LUNCH. OKAY HELLO. CHOOSING CONCENTRA SALLY -- FOR SOME CONTEXT ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL -- THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT RUNS A SUMMER MEAL PROGRAM -- TO PROVIDE FREE MEALS TO STUDENTS DURING THE SUMMER WHEN THEY'RE NOT IN REAL ATTENDING SCHOOL. THIS ONE TO THE LIBRARY PROGRAM. THE AIM OF IT IS TO INCREASE LIBRARY PARTICIPATION INTO THAT FEDERAL PROGRAM. THE FEDERAL FUNDS SUPPORT THE MEALS DIRECTLY AND SO WHAT THE STATE FUNDS WOULD DO IN THIS CASE WOULD. PROVIDE A SUPPORT THAT ASSIST LIBRARIES AND PARTICIPATING IN THAT FEDERAL PROGRAM SO PORTION OF FUNDING WOULD BE FOR OUT REACH TO GET MORE LIBRARIES TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM. ANOTHER PORTION OF FUNDING WOULD PROVIDE GRANTS THAT EITHER HELP LIBRARIES WITH THE START UP COSTS TO DEVELOP THE SIGHTS. IT WOULD ALSO PROVIDE FUNDING FOR WHICH YOU COULD THINK OF A WRAPAROUND SERVICES ARE READING PROGRAMS AND OTHER IN SUMMER AND MUCH MORE PROGRAMS THAT STUDENTS -- WHAT COULD PARTICIPATE IN AS THEIR -- ACCESSING A FREE MEAL. AND PROPOSED AND DEVELOPING THIS PROPOSAL WE THINK THE GOVERNOR HAS REYES A SAILING ISSUE FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER WHICH IS. OF FOOD INSECURITY AMONG CHILDREN DURING THE SUMMER -- SOME ESTIMATES SUGGEST THAT -- ABOUT 19% OF CALIFORNIA CHILDREN OR FOOD AND SECURE. THERE ISN'T DATA ON THE SEASONALITY OF THAT BUT IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THAT INSECURITY INCREASES DURING THE SUMMER WHEN STUDENTS AREN'T ENROLLED IN SCHOOL. AND THAT RATE -- FLUCTUATES SOMEWHAT -- IT'S THE TIRE INLAND -- TO TEND TO BE HIGHER IN IN ONE COUNTIES MORE ALONG THE COAST BUT THERE IS SOME VARIABILITY THERE ACROSS THE STATE. WE ALSO THINK THE GOVERNOR'S APPROACH OF OF TRYING TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE BY -- DRAWING DOWN MORE FEDERAL FUNDS IS REASONABLE -- OUR CONCERN HERE IS THAT -- BY FOCUSING JUST ON LIBRARY PARTICIPATION. WE'RE CONCERNED THAT THE GOVERNOR'S TAKING A SOMEWHAT NARROW APPROACH. OF THE FEDERAL MEAL PROGRAM LIBRARIES ARE ARE ONE IT SORT OF ENTITIES THAT CAN PARTICIPATE IN IT SCHOOLS CAN ALSO SERVICE SITES OTHER NON PROFITS AND LOCAL INDIES CAM CONSERVA SITES. AND PRESUMABLY -- COMMUNITIES VERY IN TERMS OF WHICH OF THESE SITES ARE THE BEST FOR SITES TO DELIVER MEALS TO TWO CHILDREN. GIVEN THIS CONCERN WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE DIRECT THE STATE LIBRARY TO COORDINATE -- WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO DEVELOP A A MORE COMPREHENSIVE PLAN I'M NOT COMPREHENSIVE PLAN WOULDN'T INCLUDE THINGS LIKE -- INVITING MORE SITES TO PARTICIPATE NOT JUST LIBRARIES -- WOULD CONSIDER COMPREHENSIVE SET OF PLANS -- TO ENCOURAGE MORE CHILDREN TO PARTICIPATE IN THE MAIL PROGRAM THAT COULD INCLUDE MORE SITES BUT ALSO POTENTIALLY OTHER. OPTIONS LIKE IMPROVING OUT REACH AND AN IMPROVING -- UP POP -- THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE PROGRAM AMONG THE POPULATION CAN ALSO TARGET FUNDING TOWARDS REGIONS WHERE THE INCIDENCE OF FOOD AND SECURITY IS HIGHER. NO DEVELOPING THIS PLAN YOU ONLY HAVE A FEW WEEKS BEFORE MAYOR VISION SO IT'S PROBABLY TOO LATE. TO HAVE SOMETHING IN TIME FOR FOR THE BUDGET SO THERE ARE TWO OPTIONS FOR THE LEGISLATURE ONE IS TO INVITE THE ADMINISTRATION TO COME BACK WITH THE PROPOSAL NEXT YEAR. THE SECOND OPTION IS TO APPROPRIATE THE FUNDING -- BUT RECALL. WERE DIRECT TO THE ADMINISTRATION TO COME UP WITH THE REVISED PLAN -- SAY BY NOVEMBER. A BEFORE THE RELEASE OF FUNDS THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU STATE LIBRARIAN. LUCAS FROM THE THE STATE LIBRARY -- THERE'S A GOOD DESCRIPTION OF THE PROGRAM. WHEN AND SENATOR MITCHELL CAME TO US WITH THE IDEA I MEAN HER INTENT WAS NOT TO GLOBAL LATE RESOLVE THE FACT THAT? ONE OUT OF FIVE SCHOOL KIDS TO GET -- REDUCED OR FREE LUNCH DURING THE SCHOOL YEAR ARE GETTING A LUNCH IN THE SUMMER. WHAT WHAT SHE HAD SAID WAS THAT A CATEGORY OF PLACES WHERE PEOPLE GO AND I FORGET HOW MANY DO YOU DO YOU HAVE THAT SOMETHING LIKE TWO THOUSAND OR THREE THOUSAND OF THESE? SITES WHERE SUMMER LUNCHES ARE SERVED AROUND THE STATE. AND SO SENATOR MITCHELL'S PITCH INITIALLY WAS WELL [inaudible] THE THERE'S A AND THERE'S AN INCREASING NUMBER OF PEOPLE GOING TO LIBRARIES BECAUSE THEY WANT TO GO TO LIBRARIES IT'S A SAFE AND STIGMA OF FREE ENVIRONMENT. THE KIDS CAN NOT ONLY GET A FREE MEAL -- BUT ALSO BENEFIT FROM ALL THE COOL THINGS THAT ARE AT ALL LIBRARY AND AND I'VE BEEN TO SOME OF THESE AND IT'S ABOUT. TEN TO ONE AND FOWLER -- EAST PALO ALTO ONTARIO. AND IN FOWLER FOR EXAMPLE THE GROWERS CONTRIBUTED PALLETS OF FOOD SO THE FAMILIES WOULD WALK OUT THE KIDS WOULD BE YOU KNOW LIKE. PLANTING BEANS AND DIXIE CUPS AND STUFF PRIOR TO GETTING THE LUNCH THE PARENTS WERE SITTING DOWN WITH. IT WHAT I THINK OF HIS COMMUNITY NAVIGATORS TO HELP THEM CONNECT TO SOCIAL SERVICES AND WALK OUT THE DOOR AND TAKE A PALETTE OF FRESH PRODUCE WITH THEM. AND IN ONTARIO. TO A PERSON EVERYONE WHO WALKED OUT FROM GETTING THE THE FREE MAIL WHICH LIKE IF CALIFORNIA GETS THE PEOPLE THERE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PAYS FOR THE PAYS FOR THE LUNCH. EVERY SINGLE PERSON SAID WHERE DO WE SIGN UP FOR SUMMER READING. AND I MEAN WITH RESPECT TO MEAN THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN THAT. COMMUNITY CENTERS OR PLACES THAT OUR NEXT -- HOMELESS SHELTERS ARE SOME OF THE OTHER -- IT INSTITUTIONS ARE FACILITIES THAT SERVE SUMMER LUNCHES. SO WOULD IT BE A GOOD THING TO HAVE SOME KIND OF GLOBAL STRATEGY. YEAH BUT THAT WAS NOT THE INTENT OF THIS PROPOSAL AND AND I WOULD SAY TO ECHO WHAT CHRIS SAID. I MEAN WHEN THIS PROPOSAL GOT PUT IN THE BUDGET IT WAS BEFORE THE NEW ADMINISTRATION. SO. I DON'T MEAN THIS MAINLY BUT IF THERE'S ANYONE SITTING HERE AT THE TABLE WHOSE TIGHT WITH THE BUCKETS THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO THEY WOULDN'T PUT THIS AND IF IT WAS. LIKE A PIG IN A POKE OR SOME KIND OF A BOONDOGGLE THING. SORRY I DIDN'T MEAN TO GO LONG. OKAY I GUESS I'M NOT GONNA GET THE PR JOB AT YOUR PLAN. TAKING A PUP. ALREADY WELL I I I I GUESS THAT THAT NOTION HERE IS A SIMPLE ONE IS. TO MAXIMIZE OUR EXISTING -- MEALS PROGRAMS AND DRAWN AS MUCH FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. MONEY AS WE CAN. TO BE KIDS IN THE SUMMER AND I KNOW. HERE IN SACRAMENTO I'M FAMILIAR WITH LOCATIONS THAT HAVE THESE -- SUMMER MEALS PROGRAMS ARE LOCAL LIBRARIES AND I HAVE SEEN THEM FIRST HAND AND I THINK THEY'RE THEY'RE VERY SUCCESSFUL TELLS TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN. DO THIS WITH A MILLION DOLLARS -- AT THE BECAUSE A REASONABLE -- PROPOSAL IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. SEEING NONE WILL HOLD THIS ISSUE OPEN THANK YOU FOR THE MARY VICE. ISSUE NUMBER SEVEN ZIP BOOKS. FOR THE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME GENERAL FUND TO SUPPORT THE TO BOOKS A PILOT PROJECT THROUGH THE STATE LIBRARY -- THIS PROGRAM ALLOWS LIBRARY PATRONS IN MORE RURAL AREAS OF THE STATE TO PURCHASE NEW MATERIALS WILL BECOME PART. OF THE LIBRARY'S COLLECTION -- THERE AFTER A SIMILAR INVESTMENT WAS MADE IN THE BUDGET ACT OF TWENTY AND JUST FOR SOME CONTEXT FOR THIS PROGRAM ALL THE WAY IT WORKS IS PARTICIPATING LIBRARIES. OTHER PATRONS DEMAND A BOOK THE LIBRARIES -- PURCHASE THE BOOK USUALLY BY ESTABLISHING A LINE OF CREDIT. THE STATE THEN UP PURCHASES THE BOOK -- THAT'S THEN DELIVERED TO THE PATRON WHO THEN RETURNS THE BOOK TO THE LIBRARY -- IN THE LIBRARY AT THAT POINT CAN DECIDE TO MAINTAIN THE BOOK OR I SELL THE BOOK THROUGH IT SOME FOUNDATION. OUR OUR ASSESSMENT HERE IS GOING TO SOUND SOMEWHAT SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS PROPOSAL AND A RECOMMENDATION AS WELL. BUT WE THINK THAT THE GOVERNOR IS ALSO IDENTIFIED ANOTHER A KEY ISSUE FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER WHICH IS -- PATRON ACCESS TO LIBRARY RESOURCES -- IN LIBRARY JURISDICTIONS THAT ARE RURAL AND HAVE BEEN A RELATIVELY UNDER RESOURCE. AND OF INSURING LIBRARY PATRONS HAVE ACCESS TO THOSE RESOURCES HAS BEEN A LONG STANDING STATE GOAL AND IS CURRENTLY EXPRESSED IN STATE LAW. OUR CONCERNS ARE THIS PROPOSAL IS THAT THERE WERE SOME KEY CONSIDERATIONS THAT -- THE PROPOSAL THAT WAS PROVIDED TO US -- LACKED. THE FIRST CONSIDERATION WAS A DATA ON THE EXTENT TO WHICH THIS IS HAPPENING -- THAT LIBRARIES ARE ABLE TO BE PATRON DEMANDS WHICH LIBRARIES AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE MAGNITUDE OF THE OF THIS PROBLEM SO THAT WE CAN BETTER UNDERSTAND IF THE PROGRAM IS ADEQUATELY TARGETED OR THAT IS TARGETING THE THE RIVER. RIGHT LIBRARY JURISDICTIONS. ON THE PROPOSAL ALSO OF DIDN'T CONSIDER SOME -- ADDITIONAL ALTERNATIVES THAT COULD BE USED TO EXPAND ACCESS -- TO PATRONS ARE RURAL AREAS OF THE STATE SUCH AS EXPANDING THE USE OF ELECTRONIC RESOURCES FOR EXAMPLE. AND THEN IN ADDITION THE PROPOSAL DIDN'T CONSIDER THE LOCAL RESOURCES THAT LIBRARIES -- SOMETIMES HAVE TO TO PURCHASE PRINT MATERIALS. FROM THE DATA WE LOOKED AT SUGGESTED THAT OF THE SIXTY NINE WIPERS ARE CURRENTLY PARTICIPATE IN THE BOOKS -- THEY SPEND ABOUT TEN MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY OUGHT TO ACQUIRE PRINT MATERIALS OBVIOUSLY THAT THAT ESTIMATE VARIES BY LIBRARY JURISDICTION SO SOME LIBRARIES HAVE MORE RESOURCES THAN OTHERS WITHIN THAT GROUP. TO TO PURCHASE THOSE MATERIALS. IN ADDITION WE HAD REQUESTED SOME HISTORICAL DATA ON THE PROGRAM THE PROGRAM'S BEEN AROUND FOR A FEW YEARS AT LEAST SINCE IT'S BEEN RECEIVING STATE FUNDING -- SO THAT WE CAN ASSESS WHETHER THE THE CURRENT QUEST AS IS REASONABLE AND WE WE HAVEN'T RECEIVED THAT DATA REQUEST YET WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION ON THAT. I'M THE GIVEN THESE CONCERNS WE ALSO RECOMMENDED THAT. OTHERS NEED THE LEGISLATURE DIRECT THE STATE LIBRARY IN THE ADMINISTRATION TO COME BACK WITH A A FOR PROPOSAL -- AS SIMILAR TO OUR RECOMMENDATION IN THE LUNCH THE LIBRARY PROGRAM THE LEGISLATURE COULD EITHER DO THIS BY INVITING THE ADMINISTRATION TO RETURN NEXT YEAR OR A CONDITIONING THE RELEASE OF THE FUNDS ON GETTING -- ON UPDATED PLAN -- AT NOVEMBER THANK YOU. REGULAR BECAUSE FROM THAT STATE LIBRARY AGAIN -- WELL AS JASON SAID THE PROGRAM'S BEEN AROUND% FOR FOUR OR FIVE YEARS IT BEGAN AS A PILOT PROJECT IN RURAL CALIFORNIA. AS A WAY TO IMPROVE CUSTOMER SERVICE SO THERE'S BUT 20% OF CALIFORNIA WHERE IT'S A BIG DEAL TO GO AND THE TOWN. AND SO THE THINKING BEHIND THIS WAS TO IMPROVE CUSTOMER SERVICE. AND REDUCE THE COSTS FOR LIBRARIES. AND THERE'S THERE'S A GREEN SORT OF BENEFIT AS WELL THE TRADITIONAL METHOD OF GETTING THESE BOOKS AS YOU CALL THE LIBRARY THEY THEY TALK TO ANOTHER LIBRARY SOMEWHERE ELSE USUALLY A LARGER DIRT JURISDICTION. THAT PUTS THEM ON A TRUCK AND SENDS -- IT TAKES ABOUT TWO WEEKS TO DELIVER -- IS JUST A COUPLE -- JASON POINTED OUT THAT THERE ARE ELECTRONIC ALTERNATIVES TO THIS -- ONE OF THEM WAS WHICH DOES WORK IN SOME PARTS OF THE STATE WHERE YOU TAKE THE CATALOGS OF ALL THESE DIFFERENT LIBRARIES AND MERGE THEM SO IF I AM IN -- GRASS VALLEY INSTEAD OF JUST SEEING THE BOOKS THAT ARE IN THE GRASS VALLEY LIBRARY I'D SEE THE BOOKS THAT ARE IN SORT OF GREATER ALTA CALIFORNIA. AND THIS COMMITTEE THE LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR BROWN PUT UP FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN THE LAST YEAR'S BUDGET. TO CONNECT EVERY LIBRARY NORTH OF SACRAMENTO WITH LINK PLUS. AND ULTIMATELY ONLY THREE LIBRARIES DECIDED TO DO THAT BECAUSE OF THE ONGOING EXPENSE OF THE PROGRAM WHICH IS ABOUT TWELVE THOUSAND DOLLARS. IN ANNUAL SUBSCRIPTION COSTS AND EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE LIBRARIES SENDS US AND ME PERSONALLY IN THE LIBRARY GENERALLY -- CONSTANT EMAILS A STEADY STREAM OF EMAILS AND NOTES THAT SAY PLEASE CONTINUE THE ZIP BOOKS MONEY WE LOVE IT BECAUSE IT'S LESS EXPENSIVE AND LESS HASSLE FOR US IN THE LIBRARY. AND OUR CUSTOMERS THINK IT'S TERRIFIC. AND FINALLY -- LAST WEEK WE HAD ALL THE PUBLIC LIBRARY DIRECTORS IN CALIFORNIA UP IN SACRAMENTO FOR A CONFERENCE AND SO IN THE HALL IN THE FOYER. OUTSIDE OF THE ROOM THEY WERE MEETING WE HAD POSTERS OF THE VARIOUS PROGRAMS THE STATE LIBRARY DOES THE EXERCISE WAS. TO GO AND PUT A POST IT ON EACH OF THE PROGRAMS THAT YOU LOVE OR THAT YOU FIND OR USE. AND THERE WERE SO MANY POSTED ON THE ZIP B<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; PROGRAM THAT SAID&lt;/c&gt;</u> THE LOVE THAT YOU COULDN'T REALLY TELL THAT IT WAS OF BOOKS. THE DEFENSE RESTS. YOUR WRITING WELL THIS IS AN INTRIGUING PROPOSAL I WILL NOTE THAT LAST WEEK WAS A TAKE YOUR DAUGHTER TO WORK DAY. SO MY DAUGHTER BARBARA CAME TO MY IN MY OFFICE AND SHE WAS THERE FOR MY BRIEFING WITH MY BUDGET -- CHIEF BUDGET STAFFER HERE MISTER MARTIN AND SO SHE WAS HERE ABOUT THE ZIP PROPOSAL. SO SHE WENT HOME WHICH IS TALKING ABOUT AND SHE THOUGHT THAT WAS A GOOD IDEA SO. FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH -- IT WE GOT TO DO A PR CAMPAIGN FOR THAT BABIES WITH A BETTER JOB THAN YOU MISTER LUCAS. I HAVE NO DOUBT SHE WOULD. ALREADY WE WILL HOLD THIS ISSUE -- OPEN. AND WE'LL PROCEED NOW WITH ISSUE NUMBER. EIGHT STATE GRANTS WEB PORTAL. CERTAINLY ASSEMBLY BILL -- TWENTY TWO FIFTY TWO WHICH WAS SIGNED IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN REQUIRED THE STATE LIBRARY -- TO ESTABLISHED A BROAD INTERNET WEB PORTAL FOR FUNDING GRANT OPPORTUNITIES THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET I IN RECOGNITION OF THAT LEGISLATION -- BEING SIGNED UP PROPOSES OR THAT THE APRIL LETTER THAT AS A PROPOSED A DEVELOP THE GREG GENERAL FUND TO DEVELOP THE GRANT PORTHOLE -- AND MAKE THAT AVAILABLE OF THAT THOUSAND IT'SONE TIME -- AND THE REMAINDER WOULD -- SUPPORT THE LIBRARIES CONTINUED OPERATION OF THE GRANT PORTABLE AS WELL AS WORKING WITH STATE AGENCIES TO OBTAIN THE INFORMATION THAT WOULD BE PLACED ON TO THAT WEBSITE AND THAT PORTAL. THE ONE ISSUE FOR CONSIDERATION WOULD RAISE FOR THE COMMITTEE WOULD BE THE ON GOING NEED FOR STAFF -- ONCE THE WEB PORTAL BECOME COMES ONLINE -- IN ORDER TO IMPLEMENT THIS PROJECT THERE IT IS LIKELY GOING TO BE CONSIDERABLE WORKLOAD THIS STATE LIBRARY HAS TO ENTER INTO AGREEMENTS WITH MULTIPLE STATE AGENCIES. TO AND TO ENSURE THAT THE WEB PORTAL WAS USABLE THAT THEY HAVE TO COORDINATE WITH STAKEHOLDERS TO ENSURE IT'S USABLE. I'M AND THEN IN ADDITION THEY HAVE TO DEVELOP A WEB PORTAL THAT -- WILL -- COORDINATE WITH OTHER WEBSITES AMONG STATE AGENCIES AND SO THAT WOULD BE THAT DEPRIVE THE OF WORKLOAD TO DEVELOP THAT WE WE THOUGHT TO POSITION SEEM JUSTIFIED. IN A FEW YEARS THERE THERE COULD ALSO BE SOME ADDITIONAL WORKLOAD -- THE STATE LIBRARY INDICATES THAT THERE WILL PROBABLY NEED TO BE ENTERED OF IMPROVEMENTS MADE TO THE WEBSITE. AFTER COMES ONLINE THERE COULD BE ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS THAT HAVE TO BE ENTERED INTO. I'M OUR QUESTION WAS EVENTUALLY ONCE IT TO THE EXTENT THAT THE STATE LIBRARY'S ABLE TO AUTOMATE THIS WEB PORTAL IN THE LONG RUN -- COULD THAT COULD THERE BE A CONTINUED I NEED TO HAVE -- TO PERMANENT POSITIONS. TO THAT END WE WE WOULD NORMALLY RECOMMEND -- OF THE LEGISLATURE PROVIDING LIMITED TERM FUNDING AND AND REVISITING WORKLOAD DEMANDS IN A FEW YEARS TO COME CONTINUE TO ENSURE THAT THE WORKLOAD IS JUSTIFIED. NOW WHEN WE BROUGHT THIS UP WITH THE ADMINISTRATION ONE CONCERN IT RAISED WAS THE ABILITY OF THE STATE LIBRARY. TO FILL THESE POSITIONS -- ANECDOTALLY SOME -- AGENCIES HAVE A HAVE VACANCIES WHEN THEY HAVE LIMITED TERM POSITIONS. AND SO IF THAT WORK IN FRONT OF THE LEGISLATURE AND WERE TO WANT -- TO PROVIDE THE FUNDING ON A LIMITED TERM BASIS IT COULD WORK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE STATE LIBRARY TO ENSURE -- THE EXISTING STATUTORY DEADLINES ARE ARE REASONABLE IN CAN BE MET THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU WE'RE GOING TO HOLD THIS ISSUE OPEN FOR THE MAY REVISION WE KNOW THIS IS MUCH. AN ISSUE THAT'S BASED UPON LEGISLATION SIGNED INTO LAW LAST YEAR SO IT IS WHAT IT IS OKAY THANK YOU WERE GOING TO PROCEED NOW WITH HASTINGS COLLEGE OF LAW THE MORNING JAX. THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS THE SAVINGS BECAUSE OF LOS BUDGET WITH YOU THIS MORNING. UC HASTINGS IS AFFILIATED WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SYSTEM BUT IS GOVERNED BY ITS OWN BOARD OF GOVERNORS. LOCATED IN SAN FRANCISCO THAT FROM IRA PRIMARILY SERVE STUDENTS SEEKING INTEREST DOCTOR DEGREE. BUT ALSO AS A MASTER OF LOS PROGRAMMING A MASTERS OF STUDIES IN LAW PROGRAM -- IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN UC HASTINGS AND ROLLED NINE HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR FULL TIME EQUIVALENT STUDENTS OF THESE EIGHT EARNED FIFTEEN WHERE JD STUDENTS. ANNUAL TUITION FOR ITS JURIS DOCTOR PROGRAM THIS YEAR. IS 440-003-0020 SIX DOLLARS. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN YOU SAY SIX TOTAL BUDGET FUNDED PRIMARILY BY GENERAL FUND IN TUITION FEES. IS EIGHTY NINE POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS WITH THE AMOUNT OF GENERAL FUNDING NINETEEN POINT EIGHT MILLION. IN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROVIDES A TWO POINT 5% AUGMENTATION DC HASTINGS. THIS REPRESENTED AN INCREASE OF ONE POINT FOUR MILLION ONGOING GENERAL FUND. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL ALSO INCLUDES ONE MILLION. ONE TIME GENERAL FUND TO SUPPORT UC HASTINGS DEFERRED MAINTENANCE NEEDS IN TOTAL THE GENERAL FUND APPROPRIATIONS THE COLLEGE WILL BE SIXTEEN POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY THANK YOU. THANK YOU LA -- SO YOU HAVE TO PROPOSALS BEFORE YOU WITH REGARD TO THE HASTINGS COLLEGE OF ALL THE FIRST IS THE BASE INCREASE AND THE SECOND IS THE ONE TIME FUNDING FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE ALL ADDRESS EACH AS SHE WANTED A TIME. WITH REGARD TO THE BASE INCREASE WE DON'T HAVE A HARD RECOMMENDATION ON TO ADOPTING MODIFYING OR REJECTING THE PROPOSAL. BUT WE DO CONTINUE TO ENCOURAGE THE LEGISLATURE TO KEEP HASTINGS OVERALL BUDGET CONDITION IN MIND -- AND IT'S A SIGNAL TO THE LAW SCHOOL AT THE LEGISLATURE'S INTENTIONS REGARDING COST INCREASES AND TUITION INCREASES AS THESE FACTORS WILL -- INFLUENCE A SCHOOL'S ABILITY -- TO ELIMINATE ITS BUDGET DEFICIT OVER THE REMAINDER OF THE PERIOD. AS A AS AN UPDATE THE LAW SCHOOL HAS REGULARLY. UP SUBMITTED TO US FIVE YEAR PLANS TO ELIMINATE THIS DEFICIT I'M IN THIS MOST RECENT PLANNED THE LAW SCHOOL. DISSIPATES ELIMINATING THIS DEFICIT BY -- TWENTY TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE THAT'S ABOUT ONE YEAR LONGER THAN A WHAT THE LAW SCHOOL HAD ANTICIPATED FOR LAST YEAR. ON THAT PLAN. THE MOSTLY ELIMINATES THE DEFICIT BY -- AT LEAST THE VERSION THAT WE'VE SEEN AND IT'S A PLAN THAT THAT CHANGES. YOU KNOW FROM TIME TO TIME BUT THE THE PLAN THAT WE'VE SEEN. ASSUMED -- TUITION INCREASES BEGINNING AND TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE I'M IN THE IN FROM OF THE LIMITING THIS DEFICIT THE LAW SCHOOL ANTICIPATES. COVERING THIS DEFICIT THROUGH ITS RESERVES OF THE LAW SCHOOL ANTICIPATED WILL START -- HAVING SPENT DOWN ITS OPERATING GENERAL OPERATING RESERVE AND WILL STOP START -- COVERING BECAUSE THEY'RE MEAN IT REMAINED OR DEFICIT WITH IT SO RESERVE THAT'S A DESIGNATED -- FOR BUILDING MAINTENANCE. WE WOULD NOTE THAT WHEN THE SCHOOL STARTED DEFICIT SPENDING IT WAS A PERIOD OF TIME WHEN THE ECONOMY WAS STRONG AND THE SCHOOL RECEIVING BASE INCREASES -- WERE THE STATE TO EXPERIENCE A RECESSION -- CORRECTING OF HASTINGS BUDGET DEFICIT COULD POSE RISKS THE LEGISLATURE AND COULD RESULT IN. POTENTIALLY MORE DIFFICULT DECISIONS SUCH AS HIGHER TUITION INCREASES FOR STUDENTS FOR EXAMPLE SO THAT'S WHY WE ENCOURAGE LEGISLATURE REVIEW THIS PLANET INSURANCE COMFORTABLE WITH. OTHER SECTIONS THE SCHOOLS MAKING. WITH REGARD TO THE SECOND PROPOSAL DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. I'M AS YOU'VE HEARD OUR OFFICE A MANY TIMES THROUGHOUT YOUR SUBCOMMITTEE HEARING SO WE GENERALLY FIND DEFERRED MAINTENANCE TO BE A HIGH PRIORITY FOR ONE TIME FUNDING. IN THIS CASE WE RECOMMEND REJECTING THE PROPOSAL. ON A REASONS ARE TWO FOLD THE FIRST IS THAT. A SCHOOL -- OF ITS REMAINING MAINTENANCE BACKLOG A PORTION OF THOSE PROJECTS ARE SOMEWHAT LOWER PRIORITY -- FOR EXAMPLE -- INTERIOR REPAINTING AND CARPETING REPLACEMENT -- SOME OF THE SOME OTHER PROJECTS ARE ARE MORE REGULAR CRITICAL BUILDING OPERATIONS LIKE I'LL. ELEVATOR CONTROLS FOR EXAMPLE SO THERE'S A MIX -- ON TERMS OF THE A CRITICALITY OF THOSE PROJECTS THE SECOND. REASON WHY RECOMMEND REJECTING IS THAT THE SCHOOL HAS -- RESERVES DESIGNATED FOR BUILDING MAINTENANCE WE THINK THOSE WOULD BE APPROPRIATE FUND SOURCE TO ADDRESS THEIR REMAINING MAINTENANCE BACKLOG [inaudible] THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU. A STINGS REPRESENTATIVE -- DAVID FAKE MEN ON THE DEAN IT -- HASTINGS COLLEGE OF THE LAW -- WE SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET -- IN TERMS OF THE REDUCTION OF ENROLLMENT OVER THE LAST -- FOUR TO FIVE YEARS -- THAT WAS A CONSIDERED DECISION OF THE COLLEGE -- IT FOLLOWS -- WHAT IS HAPPENING ACROSS THE COUNTRY THAT ALTHOUGH WE HADN'T ECONOMIC EXPANSION -- WE HAVE NOT HAD THAT CANNOT BE EXPANSION IN THE NUMBER OF LAW JOBS OR THE NUMBER OF LAW SCHOOL APPLICATIONS. AND SO AS FOR TO ALL THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA LAW SCHOOLS HAVE DONE AND VIRTUALLY ALL THE LAW SCHOOLS AROUND THE COUNTRY HAVE DONE -- IS THAT WE'VE TAKEN THE RESPONSIBLE ROUTE -- REDUCING THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS ABOUT 20% -- IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT OUR GRADUATES HAVE GOOD OPPORTUNITIES -- IN THE EMPLOYMENT MARKET -- THAT IS ACTUALLY PART OF A MUCH GREATER PLAN -- AS YOU KNOW OF COURSE THAT WE ARE QUITE GRATEFUL FOR THE GENEROSITY OF THE STATE AND ALLOCATING FUNDS TO BUILD A NEW ACADEMIC BUILDING -- THAT WILL BE COMPLETED THIS DECEMBER -- THAT GIVES US THE OPPORTUNITY TO DEMOLISH AND BUILD A ON OUR OLD ACADEMIC BUILDING SITE -- THAT BUILDING WILL BE A FOURTEEN STORY -- MIXED USE BUILDING -- IT WILL HAVE A REPLACEMENT ACADEMIC SPACE -- BUT ALSO HAVE ABOUT SIX HUNDRED AND THIRTY UNITS THE STUDENT HOUSING -- THOSE UNISYS JUNE HOUSING WILL BE SHARED -- WITH YOU CASF SOME WITH LIKELY WITH UNIVERSE CALIFORNIA BERKELEY -- AND THAT WILL ALSO THEN GIVE US AN OPPORTUNITY TO RENOVATE -- OUR HOUSING STRUCTURE -- SO WE WILL BE MOVING FROM HOUSING ABOUT TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY GRADUATE STUDENTS LAW STUDENTS TO HOUSING OVER -- THOUSAND GRADUATE STUDENTS BUT WOULD WHICH ONE COULD ABOUT 40% PLUS -- UCSF GRADUATE STUDENTS THAT -- SO THIS IS BUILDING -- WHAT I DESCRIBED AS AN ACADEMIC VILLAGE IN THE HEART OF SAN FRANCISCO -- WE WILL NOT BE INCREASING THE SIZE OF OUR JD CLASS BUT WILL BE -- COLLABORATING WITH AND PARTNERING WITH OF THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA CAMPUSES -- TO HAVE THIS VERY VIBRANT ENERGETIC -- VILLAGE IN THE TENDERLOIN CIVIC CENTER MID MARKET AREA OF SAN FRANCISCO. I ALSO HAD M. COMPANY BY MY CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER DAVID STEWART WHO CAN SPEAK MORE DIRECTLY TO SOME OF THE FINANCIAL ISSUES. OKAY WITH REGARDS TO THE THAT THE DEFICIT -- I UNDERSTAND THIS IS PART OF A LARGER. ISSUE LAW SCHOOLS ACROSS THE COUNTRY AS WELL AS ART ARE YOU SEE LAW SCHOOLS AND YOU HAVE THE BENEFIT OR HE IS NOT THE ENVY OF BEING SINGLED OUT HERE TODAY AS OPPOSED TO WE DON'T. HAVE HEARINGS ON YOU SEE. IRVINE -- BERKLEE COLLEGE OF LAW BUT YOU YOU'RE HERE TODAY BECAUSE YOUR SEPARATE OF COURSE IN THE A BUDGET THAT OUR STATE CONSTITUTION. SO. I GUESS SINCE YOU ARE HERE TODAY -- YOU KNOW HOW HOW CAN YOU ASSURE US THIS IS NOT GOING TO CONTINUE TO BE AT A DRIP DRIP BECAUSE YOU KNOW WANT ONLY A MILLION BUCKS. YOU KNOW WE HEARD EARLIER THAT. STUDENTS WHEN YOU SEND THE AUDIENCE ARE SLEEPING IN THEIR CARS. AND ARE TRYING TO GO TO COLLEGE IN. IN THIS WILL KIND OF A LUXURY WHEN YOU ASK THAT MANY PEOPLE ABOUT. OUR OUR LAW SCHOOLS THROUGHOUT OUR OUR STATE OR COUNTRY SO HOW CAN WE BE ASSURED THAT THIS IS NOT CONNECTED TO BE A DRAIN ON OUR SCARCE RESOURCES WELL FIRST WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE POINTS RAISED BY LET GENERALIST -- SOME OF THE THE NUMBERS IN THIS REPORT ARE -- INACCURATE SO WE DO NOT HAVE AN UPGRADE TO A FACT CHECK PRIOR TO THE RELEASE OF THE REPORT -- BUT THE CONCERNS RAISED ABOUT THE EXISTENCE OF THE ADEQUACY OF OUR RESERVES -- WE WILL HAVE A FOUR POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN OPERATING RESERVES AS OF THE END OF THE WEEK -- BEGINNING OF FISCAL YEAR. TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY I WILL END OF FISCAL YEAR WITH OF ANOTHER FIVE POINT NINE MILLION AND PLAN FOR RESERVE OR MAINTENANCE RESERVES FOR TOLL RESERVES OF TEN MILLION DOLLARS WE WILL NOT BE FULLY EXPANDING OUR OPERATING RESERVES AT THE END OF NINETEEN TWENTY AS INDICATED IN THE RECOMMENDATION. OF THAT SAID A RESERVE HAVE BEEN DEPLOYED CHIU OF SUPPORT OUR FINANCIAL AID STRATEGIES ARE PUT IN THIS COUNTY STRATEGIES TO ALLOW US TO BE COMPETITIVE. AND TO SUPPORT A LOWER ENROLLMENT OF MORE CLOSELY ALIGNED TO THE EMPLOYMENT PRADHAN BUTTONS WERE STUDENTS -- WE DO HAVE A PLAN TO ADDRESS THAT DEFICIT WE SHARE IT WITH THE COMMITTEE ON AN ANNUAL BASIS -- LAST YEAR YOU MAY RECALL OF SOME OF THE ASSUMPTIONS FOR USE OF WERE. QUESTION AND I THOUGHT APPROPRIATELY ONE OF SOME. WE INITIALLY HAD PROPOSAL. GRAHAM TO A 10% PAY INCREASE. UPON INPUT FROM THIS COMMITTEE WE FEEL THAT DOWN 25%. AND SUPPOSEDLY TO THE GOOGLE SHARES OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WERE ABLE TO AVOID THE FEE INCREASE TOTALLY FOR EIGHTH CONSECUTIVE YEAR -- AS TO DEFERRED MAINTENANCE THE THE ALLOCATION OF FUNDS BETWEEN. OPERATING AND DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PLANT FUND. IS TOTALLY OF THOSE DOLLARS ARE FUNGIBLE THE BOTH UNRESTRICTED FUNDS THEY CAN USE FOR OTHER PURPOSES. AND WE DO TAKE CARE AND MAINTAINING OUR FACILITIES. OF BECAUSE IT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT FOR THE INSTITUTION AN TO PROVIDE THE EXPERIENCE AT OUR STUDENTS EXPECT -- WE WILL BE BALANCING OUR BUDGET. AND DOING SO WITH A COMBINATION OF COST REDUCTIONS AND YOU KNOW HOPEFULLY SOME REVENUE GROWTH. EITHER THROUGH A GENERAL FUND OR IF NECESSARY TO FOR A FUTURE STUDENT PLEASE. AGAIN WE ARE GOING INTO OUR EIGHTH CONSECUTIVE YEAR AND WE'RE VERY PLEASED ABOUT THAT YEAH BUT THE BIGGER QUESTION HOW CAN YOU REASSURE US THAT. THIS IS NOT GOING TO CONTINUE TO BE. A OUT AND ASKING THAT A DRAG ON THE STATE BUDGET. OF THE FUNDING AUGMENTATIONS THAT WE DO RECEIVE ARE YOU KNOW FOR IN -- CONSISTENT WITH THOSE OF FORTITUDE TO SEE IF YOU AND IF THE SYSTEM -- IT'S EFFECTIVELY A OF OF COLA ADJUSTMENT ANOTHER CALL ABOUT THAT THEIR YOUR DEFICIT AND HAVING TO I UNDERSTAND THAT -- WE'RE WE ARE WE WE ARE SELF SUFFICIENT WE HAVE ALL THE FORMS OF REVENUE THAT ARE NOT REFLECTED IN THE ANNALS RESOURCE ONE POINT FOUR MILLION THE ON GOING HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH YOUR DEFICIT. OF THE ONE POINT FOUR MILLION HELPS US FUND OUR OPERATING COSTS FOR THE UPCOMING YEAR YEAH OF THE PLAY COMPENSATION. COST GROWTH. AND AFTER THAT ONE POINT FORMALLY NO OBLIGATION AYE AYE CLEARLY ARE DEFICIT WOULD INCREASE. SO WE ARE APPRECIATIVE IN SUPPORT OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AND BELIEVE THAT THE WORKLOAD ADJUSTMENT THAT'S BEEN PROVIDED. IS -- IT EQUITABLE IN PARITY WITH THE UC AND CSU OKAY THANK YOU [inaudible] MR MURATSUCHI. THANK YOU I ALSO ECHO THE CHAIRS -- SYMPATHY THEN THE HASTINGS HAS ITS OWN SEPARATE BUDGET AND SO. YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT -- A RELATIVELY SMALL AMOUNT OF OF OF MONEY HERE BUT BECAUSE YOU ARE REPRESENTATIVE. YOU'RE THE ONLY OPTION THAT WE HAVE TO TO HEAR WHAT'S GOING ON WITH OUR UNIVERSE A CALIFORNIA LAW SCHOOLS LIKE THAT I JUST HAD A FEW QUESTIONS SO. FIRST OF ALL IT WHAT IS THE THE CURRENT -- TUITION FOR LAW SCHOOL -- ARE WHAT SCHOOL TUITION ABOUT -- FORTY FOUR THREE WE ARE CURRENTLY BELOW ALL THE AT THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA LAW SCHOOLS -- VERY VERY -- ABOUT ONE TO FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS ABOUT OUR NUMBER. OKAY AND SO THAT THAT TUITION IS THE SAME WHETHER YOU'RE IN STATE OR OUT OF STATE -- NO I JUST THE COSTS ABOUT SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS MORE SIX THOUSAND MORE OKAY. AND I I SEE IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS THAT -- YOU HAVE A TUITION DISCOUNT [inaudible] AND THE YES. SO HISTORICALLY WE WERE BETWEEN TWENTY FIVE AND 30% TUITION DISCOUNT WHICH IS -- BASICALLY TO SUPPORT BOTH NEED AND MERIT -- DURING THE LEAN YEARS OF APPLICATIONS -- MOST AW SCHOOLS IN THE COUNTRY -- BEGAN TO UP THAT AMOUNT -- SO SCHOOLS LIKE -- DAVIS AND IRVINE PARTICULAR -- WHEN UP TO ABOUT 505560% TUITION DISCOUNT -- GIVEN OUR RESOURCES WE WENT UP -- BETWEEN FORTY AND FORTY FIVE BUT GIVEN THE BUDGET SITUATION WE ARE NOW WATCHING THAT BACK -- TOWARD THE 30% 28% -- HISTORICAL NORM. ACCORDING TO THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS THESE TUITION DISCOUNTS ARE ALLOCATED TO STUDENTS PRIMARILY BASED ON MERIT RATHER THAN. FINANCIAL NEED IS A AS AN ACTRESS. IT'S A BIT OF A MIX -- ABOUT SO EVEN WHEN WE ARE REWARDING I KNOW IT -- IT'S VERY OFTEN GOING TO STUDENTS WHO HAVE NEED -- IN PARTICULAR AS WAS DISCUSSED -- IN THE EARLIER PRESENTATION -- THE COST OF LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO AND THEN THE TO SUPPORTER NON TUITION -- ASPECTS OF OUR STUDENT NEEDS BECAUSE OF COURSE QUITE COMPELLING AS WELL OKAY. AND THEN YOU TALKED ABOUT HOW -- YOU'RE LOOKING AT ENROLLMENT NUMBERS GOING DOWN 20% -- OVER THE NEXT. THREE ACCORDING TO THE COMMITTEE ANNOUNCES THE WRITTEN ANALYSIS. NEXT THREE YEARS -- NOT OVER THE NEXT THE YEAR WAS OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS OVER THE PAST BY WE ARE TARGET -- CURRENTLY IS AROUND THREE HUNDRED AND THREE UNDER -- TWENTY WE EXPECT THAT THE HOLD STEADY -- IN IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. WITH WITH THE ENTERING CLASS SAID IN A CLASS WILL BE LIKELY AROUND THREE TEN AT THREE TWENTY AND THAT WILL CONTINUE -- FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. YEAH WE HAVE NO PLANS TO REDUCE THAT ALLOWS FOR THE CLASS OKAY -- AND AND YOU TALK ABOUT HOW THIS IS THE GENERAL TREND WITH LAW SCHOOLS ACROSS THE COUNTRY BECAUSE OF THEIR THE LEGAL JOB MARKET EXACTLY A HIGH -- I I GUESS MY MY CONCERN YOU KNOW FOR MY EXPERIENCE TO HAVE A HAVING GONE TO UCLA LAW SCHOOL IS THAT -- YEAH I I I DON'T. IT SEEMS TO ME LIKE THE **** THE LEGAL JOB MARKET IS IS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE THE CORPORATE LAW FIRMS AND IT'S NOT DRIVEN BY THE LACK OF GOOD PUBLIC SERVICE LAWYERS THAT THAT WOULD PROVIDE LIKE SAY. YOU KNOW WITH THE ADVICE IMMIGRATION ADVICE. FOR FOUR FOUR IF A FAMILY STUCK AT THE BORDER -- OUR OUR SOUTHERN BORDER OR YOU KNOW THE MANY OTHER NEEDS THAT THAT THAT WE CAN THINK OF WHERE WHERE LAWYERS CAN BE -- YOU KNOW VERY VERY USEFUL AND AND SO. WHAT IS HASTINGS DOING YOU KNOW? WHAT WHEN WHEN I SEE ON? WAIT WHEN WHEN I SEE MOST OF OF OF LAW SCHOOL GRADUATES GOING TO WORK IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR RATHER THAN WHILE WORKING AND PUBLIC SERVICE JOBS AND I I DON'T THINK THAT THE THE THE THE IT SEEMS TO ME LIKE A LIKE BE. ENROLLMENT DECISIONS ARE BEING DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY THE PRIVATE LEGAL JOB MARKET RATHER THAN THE THE THE PUBLIC JOB MARKET BANG I WANT TO GIVE YOU. A CHANCE TO RESPOND. AND I THINK THAT'S AN INTERESTING OBSERVATION I THINK IT SUBMITS BAD -- WE HAVE ABOUT INTO A SO CALLED BIG LAW WHICH MIGHT BE MORE ONE HUNDRED LAW FIRMS -- BUT OF COURSE HASTENS HAS A GREAT TRADITION OF SUPPLYING OF PUBLIC SERVICE PUBLIC INTEREST ATTORNEYS I WE HAVE A NUMBER NUMBER CENTERS YOU MENTIONED IMMIGRATION -- WE HAVE THE SENDER CENTER FOR GENDER AND REFUGEE STUDIES RUN BY COUNTY SALO -- WHO DOES EXACTLY WHAT YOU DESCRIBE WHICH IS THE SUN WARRIORS TO THE BORDER -- TO HELP -- SEPARATED FAMILIES -- TO REPRESENT -- DHAKA -- STUDENTS AND AND SO ON AND OF COURSE JEFF ADACHI WAS A GRADUATE OF HASTINGS -- COMMA HARRIS OF BETTER THE HASTINGS WILL YOU KNOW -- WILLIE BROWN WASN'T GRADUATE HASTINGS -- SO QUITE PROUD OF OF THE PUBLIC SERVICE -- THAT OUR OUR GRADUATES A GUN -- I WOULD SAY TODAY -- HOUR OR MIX NOT BE HAPPY TO ACTUALLY SUPPLY THOSE THOSE NUMBERS FOR YOU -- IN IN IN WRITING -- IS A MIX OF BIG LAW FIRMS BUT RECALL FROM JACKSON NOT HIRING AS MUCH FROM STRAIGHT FROM LAW SCHOOL OTHER CHRISLEY HIGHER LATERALS AND SO A LOT OF OUR STUDENTS JUST STARTING IN SMALLER LAW FIRMS -- AND ACTUALLY MANY YEARS STARTING DOWN A CORPORATE WELL LAW DEPARTMENTS BUT I I DON'T SEE I MEAN IF IF THEY'RE PAYING FORTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS IN IN A TUITION A YEAR I I ASSUME THERE. YOU KNOW A A WHAT THE THAT'S A OVER A HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND WHEN THEY GRADUATE. I MEAN I WOULD I WAS PAYING SEVEN THOUSAND A YEAR WHEN I WENT TO LAW SCHOOL IN IN IN IN THE NINETIES. I DON'T SEE HOW YOU CAN ANYONE CAN GOING TO PUBLIC SERVICE. YOU KNOW WITH A HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS -- TUITION BILL NOW THERE ARE PUBLIC INTEREST LOAN FORGIVENESS PROGRAMS AND AND HOW MANY. HOW MANY STUDENTS AT HASTINGS RECEIVE I HAVE THE EXACT NUMBER BUT THEN THE TO BUT I'D BE HAPPY TO SUPPLY THAT -- BUT MANY -- DO -- VIRTUALLY ALL THAT GOING PUBLIC CONTRAST -- SEEK IT OUT IF THEY HAVE A SIGNIFICANT THAT -- BUT EXACTLY YOUR OBSERVATION -- AND I'M SURE YOU HAVE FROM JENNIFER MENU CAM -- AS AN ALARM AT UCLA THAT -- MANY OF OUR ALUMNI WENT TO SCHOOL IN THE SEVENTIES EIGHTIES AND NINETIES WHEN -- WE WERE HEAVILY SUBSIDIZED BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- AND WE DO SAID WELL AND I THIS IS THE TIME TO GET BACK AND SO WE DO ASK OUR ALUMNI JUST BY -- SCHOLARSHIPS AND SUPPORT -- THAT WOULD HELP THE STUDENTS GRADUATE WITH MUCH LESS THAN -- THEN IF THEY'RE PAYING. FULL FULL FREIGHT. I I GUESS I WOULD JUST SEND A MISTER CHAIR I YOU KNOW WHERE EVER SINCE MY DAYS WITH THE WITH THE LAW SCHOOL AND AND AND AND JUST SEEING THE THE YOU KNOW. EXTREMELY HIGH TUITION COSTS THAT THAT ARE BEING CHARGED TO OUR PROFESSIONAL STUDENTS INCLUDING LAW STUDENTS. THAT. IT SEEMS TO ME LIKE. THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA INCLUDING HASTINGS SHOULD BE FOCUSING MORE ON EDUCATING ATTORNEYS TO GO INTO PUBLIC SERVICE. AND NOT NECESSARILY TO BE PROVIDING -- YOU KNOW. BUT WHAT IT WHAT I ASSUME IS IS STILL A A CHEAPER ALTERNATIVE TO TWO PRIVATE LAW SCHOOLS. YOU KNOW TO TO BE EDUCATING GO LAWYERS. FOR FOR FOR CORPORATE LAW FIRMS. WELL HE COMES. WITH A SOLUTION AND PROPOSAL. IT WILL TAKE A LOOK AT THAT BUT I I THINK YOU RAISE AN IMPORTANT ISSUE AND ONE THING I FIND INTERESTING. MISTER ICE WHICH IS IF YOU LOOK AT SAN FRANCISCO'S AND THE CSU DEBATE. SAN FRANCISCO STATE IS SEPARATE TOPIC HERE IS IS ONE THE UNIVERSITIES WERE ENROLLMENT IS DECLINING. COVERED AREA SAN FRANCISCO SO WHAT IS THAT MEANS THAT IT'S SO EXPENSIVE. THAT PEOPLE YOU KNOW THEY GOT ACCEPTED THERE LIKE NAM A PASS YOU KNOW. I CAN'T AFFORD TO LIVE THERE SO WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT FORTY FOUR THOUSAND A YEAR. TUITION FOR SOMEONE WILL STICK THAT PURSUE A CAREER IN PUBLIC SERVICE. YOU LOOK AT THE HOUSING COSTS THE AVERAGE. ONE BEDROOM APARTMENT IN SAN FRANCISCO'S FOUR THOUSAND A MONTH. SO YOU KNOW THAT'S DOUBLE THAT AS FAR AS YOUR YOUR HOUSING COSTS THROUGHOUT THE YEAR SO. YEAH I'M NOT SURE HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE. ARE ARE GOING TASTINGS TO PURSUE A CAREER WORKING FOR LUNCH COUNSELOR. SOME PUBLIC INTEREST ENTITY -- BUT BUT WITH THAT AGAIN YOU HAVE THE DISTINCTION IN THE ENVY AND THE NOT SO MUCH THE ENVY OF BEING SINGLED OUT HERE AS THE LAW SCHOOL. THAT WE TALK ABOUT THESE ISSUES ON A AND PRIVILEGE YES. ALREADY THANK YOU WILL HOLD THIS ISSUE OPEN. AND CIRCLE BACK AFTER THE MAY REVISE THAT CONCLUDES THE THE AGENDA IS. ITEM TODAY WILL NOW -- PROCEED WITH PUBLIC COMMENT ANY PUBLIC COMMENT FOR ISSUES. ON THE AGENDA OR NOT ON THE AGENDA NOW IS YOUR OPPORTUNITY. PLEASE -- COME TO THE CENTER OF THE HEARING ROOM. AND PLEASE KEEP YOUR COMMENTS TO ONE MINUTE OR LESS SIXTY SECONDS OR LESS THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING LARA AS OTHER CUBITS WITH THE INSTITUTE FOR COLLEGE ACCESS AND SUCCESS WE ARE ALSO VERY CONCERNED ABOUT NEEDY STUDENTS PARENTS BUT BELIEVE A MORE EFFECTIVE. TARGETED SOLUTION TO ADDRESSING UNMET NEED WOULD BE TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF ANNUALLY AVAILABLE COMPETITIVE CAL GRANTS. AS THE ANNOUNCES POINTS OUT THE VAST MAJORITY 71% OF COMPETITIVE CAL GRANT ELIGIBLE STUDENT PARENTS DO NOT RECEIVE ONE SIMPLY BECAUSE TOO FEW ARE AVAILABLE. THE HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWO MILLION PROPOSED COULD INSTEAD FIND OVER FIFTY THOUSAND MORE COMPETITIVE AWARDS EACH YEAR ALMOST TRIPLING THE CURRENT AMOUNT. THIS WOULD PROVIDE MUCH NEEDED STATE FINANCIAL AID TO MANY MORE OF THE OVER THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND ELIGIBLE APPLICANTS EACH YEAR. MANY OF WHOM ARE PARENTS AND MOST OF WHOM ARE VERY LOW INCOME HE DID NOT RECEIVE A CAL GRANT SIMPLY BECAUSE NOT ENOUGH FOR AVAILABLE. WE ALSO SUPPORT INCREASING THE CAL GRANT BE ACCESS THE WORD TO HELP OUR NEEDY STUDENTS BETTER COVER TOTAL COLLEGE COSTS INCLUDING LIVING EXPENSES. THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK TO HELP NEEDY CALIFORNIANS GET THE FINANCIALLY THEY NEED TO ACCESS AND SUCCEED IN COLLEGE THANK YOU. THIS YEAR MY DL REPRESENT THE CALIFORNIA LIBRARY ASSOCIATION STRONGLY SUPPORT BOTH A LUNCH IN THE LIBRARY AND THE ZIP BOOKS A PROGRAM -- MISTER LUCAS MADE REFERENCE TO THE FACT THAT THESE ARE MORE THAN JUST LUNCH AT THE LIBRARY -- JUST QUICKLY -- BUT LAST YEAR WE ASK FOR SOME INFORMATION IN ONTARIO THAT MISTER LUCAS ALSO MENTIONED SAID THAT THEY OF FAMILIES COME FOR LUNCH AND END UP STAYING FOR THE DAY THE ATTEND PROGRAMS CHECK OUT BOOKS AND USE OUR OTHER SERVICES A PORTION OF THESE FAMILIES EVERY YEAR A COMPLETELY NEW.
