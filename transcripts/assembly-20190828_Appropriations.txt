COMMITTEE AUGUST TWENTY EIGHTH HEARING NOTING THE ABSENCE OF A QUORUM WE WILL GO AHEAD AND START AS A SUBCOMMITTEE WE HAVE TWELVE BILLS CONSIDER THIS MORNING AND MISTER ALLEN. IN YOUR FIRST SINCE YOU'RE ALREADY THERE. YOU'LL BE PRESENTING ON SB SIX SIXTY FOUR. WE'RE DOING ALL SOME DIFFERENT ON THIS SO WE'RE GOING TO AFTER YOUR PRESENTATION BUT IF THERE IS A MOTION WE WILL MOVE THIS TO THE RULES COMMITTEE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR OF A APPRECIATE THAT I'M HAPPY TO TALK PROBABLY ABOUT THIS AT THIS THIS BILL DEFENDS THE VITAL PUBLIC INTEREST IN THE OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE OF CALIFORNIA'S TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE. BY AFFIRMING REGIONAL AGENCIES THE ONES THAT SERVE ALL OF OUR CONSTITUENTS TRANSPORTATION NEEDS HAVE CLEAR AUTHORITY TO RESPONSIBLE USE PERSONAL INFORMATION DURING THEIR DAY TO DAY ACTIVITIES TO OPERATE TOLL AND TRANSIT SYSTEMS ON THE PUBLIC'S BEHALF. AS THE COMMITTEES ANALYSIS OUTLINES IT IS QUITE UNLIKELY THE STATE WILL FACE DIRECT COSTS AS A RESULT OF THIS BILL HOWEVER I AM BEFORE YOU BECAUSE- A LIST OF LITIGANTS SOME PETITIONING FOR CLASS ACTION STATUS OF FILE CLAIMS AGAINST NUMEROUS. REGIONAL TOLL AGENCIES AND CONTRACTORS THROUGHOUT THE STATE ALLEGEDLY ALLEGING VIOLATIONS THAT LITTLE IMPERIL BILLIONS IN TAXPAYER DOLLARS AND JUST TO GIVE YOU A SENSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE SHARING OF NAMES AND ADDRESSES FOR THE IMPROV INTER OPERABILITY OF A FAST TRACK. YOU KNOW BOX WAR FOR TOLL COLLECTION THAT SORT OF THING. SO I IN THE MIDST OF THESE LAWSUITS A CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL WOULD APPLY RETROACTIVELY IN THE SECTIONS DESERVE VERY VERY CAREFUL SCRUTINY BY ALL OF US. ALL OF US TO ENSURE THAT GRANTING RETROACTIVITY IS INDEED IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST. NOW MY STAFF AND I HAVE ASKED A PLAINTIFFS IN THESE CASES TO DEMONSTRATE THE CONSUMER HARM TO THEIR CLIENTS HAVE SUFFERED AS A RESULT OF THE MILLIONS OF ALLEGE PRIVACY VIOLATIONS. AND WE'VE YET TO BE SHOWN ANYTHING TANGIBLE. I ABSENT CLEAR EVIDENCE THE CALIFORNIA BETTER OFFICE BILLIONS OF TAX DOLLARS ARE IMPERILED. SB SIX SIXTY FOUR PROVIDES AN IMPORTANT CLARIFICATION A STATE LAW TO CONTINUE ALLOWING TRANSPORTATION AND TRANSIT AGENCIES TO USE. NAMES AND ADDRESSES THAT KIND OF PERSONAL DATA EFFICIENTLY WHILE MAINTAINING APPROPRIATE PROHIBITIONS AGAINST IMPROPER SHARING. OF THAT INFORMATION WORK VERY CLOSELY ENGAGED WITH THE SENSE OF NEGOTIATIONS WITH POLICY COMMITTEE STAFF FROM PRIVACY COMMITTEE. AND OPPONENTS OVER THE PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL ASK FOR THIS COMMITTEE'S INDULGENCE PERMIT THOSE CONVERSATIONS TO CONTINUE. BY SENDING THE BILL OVER TO THE RULES COMMITTEE AS WAS STATED BY THE CHAIR. TODAY WHILE THE NOW SAYS NOTES THE MAKING THIS A TO YOUR BILL MIGHT PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR STAKEHOLDERS TO WORK OUT THEIR DIFFERENCES. I DO BELIEVE THAT CERTAIN DISAGREEMENTS OVER RETRO TICKET ACTIVITY IN THIS BILL WILL BE IMPOSSIBLE TO FULLY RESOLVE. AND I'M OPTIMISTIC THAT WE ARE MAKING REAL PROGRESS TO ELEVATE IMPROVE MANY TOLL AGENCY BEST PRACTICES IN THE SYSTEM STANGEL FASHION. MOVING FORWARD IN THAT WE CAN GET THIS DONE OVER THE NEXT COUPLE WEEKS. AS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. I TO THE MOTION. THANK YOU SPEAKERS IN SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND I WANT TO BE CLEAR AND I'M SORRY BECAUSE THIS IS SO UNUSUAL. SO. YOU CAN SPEAK OF COURSE IN SUPPORT BUT IT'S OBVIOUSLY NOT A POLICY COMMITTEE. IT'S A FISCAL IN THE FISCAL IS INCOMPLETE IN THAT WE EXPECT ADDITIONAL. MOVEMENT RULES AND WOULD HAVE TO COME BACK SO ALTHOUGH YOU CAN SPEAK I WOULD SUGGEST THERE'S NOT A LOT OF ROOM ON WHAT. WOULD MAKE SENSE TO SPEAK ON OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH MA'AM CHAIR. SO I'LL JUST HIGHLIGHT THAT TO MAKE IT VERY CLEAR THAT THEY HAVE BEEN NO BREACHES OF PRIVACY SALES OF CONCERTS OF CUSTOMER DATA. DATA FOR CONSUMER HAN HAS CENTER ALLEN POINTED OUT. RESULTING FROM OUR AGENCIES TOWING OPERATIONS HOWEVER CLARIFICATIONS TO THE EXISTING STATUTES ARMY IT TO RESOLVE CERTAIN GRAY AREAS IN THE VERBIAGE. IN THIS GRAY AREA IS WHAT THE VARIOUS LAWSUITS THAT HAVE BEEN TARGETED AGAINST AGENCIES HAVE SOUGHT TO EXPLOIT. SO SENATE BILL SIX SIXTY FOUR WOULD CLARIFY THESE ISSUES AND ALLOW US TO PERFORM OUR DAILY FUNCTIONS OF TOLL OPERATIONS. COLLECTING TOLLS ENFORCING THE PAYMENT TOLLS AND SUPPORTING STATE MANDATED INTER OPERABILITY. SO WE WOULD LIKE TO THANK CENTER ALLEN FOR BRINGING ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS TOGETHER ON THIS ISSUE. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO FINALIZING A MINUTES OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS TO ADDRESS THE REMAINING ISSUES. SO WITH THAT ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA'S TOLD.
