GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS STAND UP WITH THANK THE CHAIR IN THE COMMITTEE FOR ALL YOUR TIME ON THIS BILL I ACCEPT THE SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS OUTLINED ON PAGES SEVEN AND EIGHT OF THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS THIS BILL ENSURES THAT THE COLLECTION OF RENT THAT IS COVERED BY THE SAME REQUIREMENTS AS OTHER KINDS OF CONSUMER DEBT UNDER THE STATE'S ROSENTHAL FAIR DEBT COLLECTION PRACTICES ACT SPECIFICALLY THIS BILL ADDS TO THE DEFICIT ADDS TO THE DEFINITION OF CONSUMER. ANY RENTAL THAT. BECAME PAST DUE ON OR AFTER JANUARY FIRST TWENTY NINETEEN. AND DEFINES RENTAL THAT AS UNPAID RENT OR ANY OTHER UNPAID FINANCIAL OBLIGATION OF A TENANT UNDER TENDENCY. DURING THE EVICTION MORATORIUM TENANTS HAVE ACCUMULATED UNPRECEDENTED pOF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS PER FAMILY. THE RULES AND PROCESSES FOR EVICTIONS PANDEMIC THAT AND WRITTEN RELIEF HAVE BECOME COMPLEX AND ARE CONSTANTLY CHANGING MANY LANDLORDS HAVE RECEIVED ASSISTANCE FROM RATE RELIEF PROGRAMS AND IT'S CRITICAL FOR FAMILIES TO UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH DEBT THEY'VE ACCUMULATED WHICH DEBTS ARE STILL OUTSTANDING. AND THE STATUS OF PAST DUE RENT PAID THROUGH RENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAM- JUST ON THE LAST DAY OF THE STATEWIDE PROGRAM OVER THIRTY THOUSAND APPLICATIONS WERE SUBMITTED AND NEARLY OVER HALF A MILLION APPLICATIONS WERE SUBMITTED STATEWIDE. TENANTS MUST HAVE ACCURATE INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR DEBT NOW THAT RELIEF PROGRAMS HAVE ENDED AND WE ARE BEGINNING TO NAVIGATE A DIFFICULT LEGAL AND LANDSCAPE I ECONOMIC LANDSCAPE TRANSPARENCY IS EVEN MORE IMPORTANT. MY DISTRICT NEARLY 80% ARE RENTERS MANY OF THEM- LIKE MANY OF THE FAMILIES IN YOUR DISTRICTS WERE ALREADY LIVING ON THE EDGE BEFORE THE DEEP INSTABILITY OF THIS PANDEMIC. THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS NOTES- MORTGAGE DEBT IS ALREADY EXPRESSLY COVERED BY THE ROSENTHAL ACT A PERSON OWES RENTAL DEBT SHOULD ABSOLUTELY ENJOY SIMILAR PROTECTIONS AS A PERSON WHO OWES MORTGAGE DEBT. HOMEOWNERS AND RENTERS HAVE BOTH SUFFERED IN THIS CRISIS BOTH DESERVE THE DIGNITY OF THESE PROTECTIONS. SOME DAVID CHIU MORATORIUM WAS MEANT TO KEEP FAMILIES IN THEIR HOMES WHILE THE ACCESS NEEDED ASSISTANCE TO KEEP OUR COMMUNITY STABLE AS WE ATTEMPTED TO RECOVER AND HEAL FROM A CRISIS THAT IS PERMANENTLY CHANGED OUR WAY OF LIFE WE MUST NOW HELP CALIFORNIANS AS THEY WORK HARD TO BUILD THEIR LIVES TODAY I HAVE TWO WITNESSES HERE WITH US TED MERMAN FROM THE CALIFORNIA LOW INCOME CONSUMER COALITION AND DANNY KENDALL **** ON BEHALF OF A STINT. ATTENDANT TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT. JERRY BROWN MEMBERS GOOD MORNING I'M TED MERMAN FROM THE CALIFORNIA LOW INCOME CONSUMER COALITION. SENATOR RAZA THANK YOU FOR YOUR- MOVING REMARKS THIS MORNING YOU YOU'VE JUSTIFIED EXACTLY WHY THIS BILL IS SO NECESSARY WE ARE FACED TODAY WITH AN UNPRECEDENTED SITUATION WE HAVE NEVER HAD IN CALIFORNIA ANYTHING LIKE THE BACKUP OF BACK RENT DEBT THAT MILLIONS OF TENANTS AND LANDLORDS NOW FACE IN CALIFORNIA. THE PANDEMIC AND THE VIXEN MORATORIUM HAVE LED TO HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS EVEN BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT ARE GOING TO BE SUBJECT TO DEBT COLLECTION FOR THE FIRST TIME THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA NEED THE LEGISLATURE TO DO SOMETHING YOU PROBABLY HAVE DONE LONG WHICH IS TO EXTEND THE PROTECTIONS OF THE ROSENTHAL ACT. TO COVER THE COLLECTION A RENTAL THAT IT'S A QUIRK OF DRAFTING THAT THIS STATE LAW DOESN'T ALREADY EXPRESSLY APPLY TO RENTAL THAT WHAT THE FEDERAL FAIR DEBT COLLECTION PRACTICES ACT DOES THIS IS A LOOPHOLE WE CAN CLOSE NOW. TENANTS NEED DESERVE THE SAME PROTECTIONS AS OTHER DEBTORS THEY DESERVE INFORMATION ABOUT WHO IS TRYING TO COLLECT THE DEBT. THEY DESERVE A BAN ON TELEPHONE CALLS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT OR THREATS TO THROW THEM IN JAIL IF THEY DON'T PAY. AND THEY DESERVE AN EFFECTIVE WAY TO ENFORCE THOSE RULES. MEANWHILE LET BIRDS NEED THE SAME RULES OF THE ROAD AS OTHER BUSINESSES THAT ARE COLLECTING THEIR DEBTS. ALMOST ANY OTHER BUSINESS THAT A CONSUMER OWES MONEY TO IN THE STATE CAN CONSULT THE ROSENTHAL ACT. THE SEE WHAT THEY CAN AND CAN'T DO THE COLLECTED THAT FOR LANDLORDS IT'S NOT CLEAR. THEY DESERVE THE SAME CLARITY THAT THIS LEGISLATURE HAS PROVIDED OTHER BUSINESSES. THE SPONSORS APARTMENT ASSOCIATION ARE IN SOLID AGREEMENT THE HARASSMENT OF TENANTS SHOULD NEVER BE ALLOWED WE ALSO AGREE THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE A WAY TO ENFORCE THE LAW AND WE HAVE BEEN ENGAGED IN A CONSTRUCTIVE CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW BEST TO ACCOMPLISH THESE GOALS THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS ADDRESS TWO OF THE THREE ISSUES INITIALLY RAISED BY THE CA THE SPONSORS APPRECIATE THE PRODUCTIVE DISCUSSIONS WE HAVE HAD. AND WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE AS THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR IPHONE. GOOD MORNING CHAIR MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY- DANNY CANNOT BECAUSE OUR ON BEHALF OF THE CO SPONSOR OF THE BILL PUBLIC COUNCIL. OF THE WORLD'S LARGEST PRO BONO PUBLIC INTEREST LAW FIRM. OUR INTENT TODAY WAS TO BRING A TENANT HERE TO- EITHER CALL IN OR SPEAK IN PERSON. ABOUT THE ISSUES THAT SB THIRTEEN TWENTY FOUR AIMS TO ADDRESS UNFORTUNATELY. THIS WOMAN IS UNABLE TO SHARE HER STORY FIRST HAND DIRECTLY WITH YOU FOR FEAR OF FURTHER HARASSMENT BY HER LANDLORD. WILL CALL HER MISS GONZALEZ THIS PAST YEAR PUBLIC COUNCIL WORKED WITH MS GONZALEZ THROUGH ITS HOMELESSNESS PREVENTION PROJECT A SINGLE MOTHER LIVING WITH HER FOSTER DAUGHTER. SHE HAS BEEN EXPERIENCING RELENTLESS HARASSMENT FROM HER LANDLORD THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC. WE SHOULD BEGIN TO STRUGGLE TO PAY HER RENT DUE TO PANDEMIC RELATED ECONOMIC DISTRESS. LINDLAR BEGAN SHOWING UP AT HER HOME. BOTH IN ON AT NIGHT AND ON THE WEEKENDS DEMANDING RENT MULTIPLE TIMES PER WEEK AND HOUNDING MISS GONZALEZ TO PAY. ONCE A RENT RELIEF APPLICATION BECAME AVAILABLE MISS GONZALEZ IMMEDIATELY APPLIED. BUT THIS DID NOT SATISFY THE DEMANDS OF THE LANDLORD WHO CONTINUE TO HARASS MISS GONZALEZ BY SHOWING UP IN PERSON MULTIPLE TIMES PER WEEK. AGAIN AT NIGHT AND ON WEEKENDS TO DEMAND UPDATES ON THE APPLICATION STATUS. ULTIMATELY THE LANDLORD RECEIVED SEVERAL MONTHS WORTH OF PAYMENTS THROUGH THE RENTAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM IN BOTH LANDLORD AND MISS GONZALEZ THEN SUBMITTED N ADDITIONAL FUNDING REQUEST IN TWNTY TWENTY ONE. DESPITE BEING FULLY AWARE THAT MISS GONZALEZ HAD FILL UP A FILLED OUT THE SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING APPLICATION THE LANDLORD FILED AN UNLAWFUL DETAINER AGAINST MISS GONZALEZ. LYING ON THEIR COVER SHEET IN AN ATTEMPT TO OBTAIN A SUMMONS. FORTUNATELY THE CASE WAS RECENTLY DISMISSED AFTER OUT BECAUSE YOU BY PUBLIC COUNCIL. BUT IT IS CASES SUCH AS THIS AS WELL AS THOSE WHICH DO NOT HAVE SUCH OUTCOMES THE UNDERSCORE THE NEED FOR THE PROTECTIONS IN SB THIRTEEN TWENTY FOUR THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION WE URGE AND I FELT. THANK YOU MR MERMAN AND MISCONDUCT HEISER. AT NOW LET'S BEGIN WITH OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT HERE IN THE ROOM. SEEN NO OTHER WITNESSES IN A SUPPORT IN THE ROOM WE WILL MOVE TO WITNESSES TESTIFYING VIA TELECONFERENCE SERVICE MODERATOR IF YOU WOULD PLEASE PROMPTLY INDIVIDUALS WAITING TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF IT SB THIRTEEN TWENTY FOUR WE WILL BEGIN. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT SB THIRTEEN TWENTY FOUR YOU MAY PRESS ONE AND THAT IS ZERO. AGAIN IT IS ONE AND THEN THREE OF YOUR SUPPORT OF S. B. THIRTEEN TWENTY FOUR. AND WE WILL GO TO LINE FOURTEEN YOUR LINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. HI THIS IS SUSIE AND- I'LL SKI I'M CALLING FROM THAT THAT IT LEGAL SERVICES AND I'M CALLING IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AT THIRTEEN TWENTY FOUR THANK YOU. THANK YOU WE HAVE NOT FOR THIS IMPORTANT TO YOU AT THIS TIME. GREAT THANK YOU HAVING HEARD FROM ALL SUPPORTERS WHO WILL NOT FOLLOW THE SAME PROCESS AND HEAR FROM ANY OPPOSITION. THAT WE HAVE AMBER MADISON FROM THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION WHO WILL BE TESTIFYING IN PERSON SENATORS MY NAME IS AMBER MEDICINE FROM THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION AND I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT WE WHOLEHEARTEDLY SUPPORT THE INTENT OF THIS BILL. WHICH IS TO MAKE SURE THAT TENANTS ARE NOT HARASSED WHEN TRYING TO COLLECT PAST DUE RENT. WELL WE APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENTS. ARE WE STILL HAVE OPPOSITION TO THE FORM AND SUBSTANCE TO THE EXISTING. EXISTING VERSION OF S. B. THIRTEEN TWENTY FOUR FOR TWO REASONS. FIRST THE ROSENTHAL ACT PLAINLY STATES ITS PURPOSE IS TO GOVERN THE BANKING AND CREDIT SYSTEM. AND FOR DECADES CALIFORNIA COURTS HAVE HELD. THAT RENT IS NOT A CONSUMER DEBT OWED IN ADVANCE OF THE SERVICES PROVIDED. IN OTHER WORDS RENTAL HOUSING IS NOT PROVIDED ON CREDIT DISTINCT FROM MORTGAGE RIGHT WHICH THERE IS A CREDIT TRANSACTION INVOLVED. S. B. THIRTEEN TWENTY FOUR WOULD NOW SAY THAT RENTAL DEBT IS PROVIDED ON CREDIT. THE ISSUE OF CONSUMER DEBT IS COMPLICATED BECAUSE THE ROSENTHAL ACT INCORPORATES FEDERAL DEBT COLLECTION LAWS. SO BY LUMPING SOMETHING THAT IS NOT A CREDIT TRANSACTION INTO THAT SUBSTANTIVE AREA OF STATE AND FEDERAL LAW. SB THIRTEEN TWENTY FOUR NECESSARILY APPLIES PROVISIONS OF FEDERAL LAW THERE INCONGRUENT WITH OUR LANDLORD TENANT LAW. THAT BRINGS ME TO MY SECOND POINT. THE BILL CREATES A CONFLICT WITH EXISTING UNLAWFUL DETAINER LAW THAT COULD MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR LANDLORDS TO PROPERLY FILE AN UNLAWFUL DETAINER ACTION WHILE COMPLYING WITH THE BILL'S PROVISIONS. FOR EXAMPLE STATED EARLIER SB THIRTEEN TWENTY FOUR INCORPORATES THE RULES REGARDING THE FEDERAL FAIR DEBT COLLECTION PRACTICES ACT. A FEDERAL LAW REQUIRES SPECIFIC ACTIONS REGARDING THE FIRST CONTACT THE DEBT COLLECTOR MAKES WITH THE DEBTOR. THEN REQUIRES A SPECIFIC WRITTEN NOTICE CONFIRMING THAT DEBT. AND FINALLY MAKES A DISTINCT DEBT RESOLUTION PROCESS BETWEEN THE TWO PARTIES APPLICABLE. THE UNLAWFUL DETAINER PROCESS THAT WE ALREADY HAVE ALREADY BEGINS WITH A NOTICE TO PAY RUN A QUICK. NOTICES ARE ALWAYS ARE ALSO USED TO END OF TENANCY OR TO CHANGE TERMS AND ELISE SO PLAYING THESE NEW FEDERAL RULES ON TOP OF THE EXISTING. CALIFORNIA RULES WOULD EFFECTIVELY REWRITE CALIFORNIA'S LANDLORD TENANT NOTICE PROCESS. CALIFORNIA'S EXISTING UNLAWFUL DETAINER PROCESSES ARE TOO COMPLICATED AND IS COMPLICATED IN PART BECAUSE THERE'S TWO THINGS THAT ISSUE. ONE IS PAST DUE RENT THE SECOND IS POSSESSION OF PROMISES. RIGHT NOW SB THIRTEEN TWENTY FOUR DOES NOT APPRECIATE AND TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THAT LANDLORDS MUST ALSO GAINED POSSESSION OF THE PREMISES IN ADDITION TO COLLECTING PAST DUE RENT. AND WE HOPE TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE OFFER TO ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU MISTER MADISON. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION IN THE ROOM.CENA WE WILL MOVE TO WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION TESTIFYING BE THE TELECONFERENCE MODERATOR IF YOU WOULD PLEASE PROMPT THE INDIVIDUALS WAITING TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION OF S. B. THIRTEEN TWENTY FOUR WE WILL BEGIN. THANK YOU FOR OPPOSITION FOR SB THIRTEEN TWENTY FOUR YOU MAY PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO. AGAIN THAT IS THE ONE AND THEN ZERO FOR S. B. THIRTEEN TWENTY FOUR IN OPPOSITION. AND WE WILL GO TO LINE NINE YOUR LINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD MORNING- MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS CREAM GREASY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS IN OPPOSITION RESPECTFULLY REQUEST A NOTEBOOK THANK YOU. THANK YOU WE WILL GO TO LINE TWELVE PLEASE GO AHEAD. BENCHER MEMBERS BACKGROUND WITH THEIR AND RENEGOTIATES REPRESENTING THE SEVEN CALIFORNIA RENTAL HOUSING ASSOCIATION VERSION THANK YOU. THANK YOU NOW VOTE TO LINE ELEVEN. DANIEL GOOD CARE THE ONLY HALF OF THE CONSUMER FEDERATION OF CALIFORNIA APOLOGIES RESTING SUPPORT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR WE HAVE NO FURTHER ACTIVITY THANK YOU THANK YOU. I'M IN THANKS TO ALL THE SUPPORT OPPOSITION WITNESSES NOW WILL BE IN THE DISCUSSION WITH MEMBERS MEMBERS ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS WE'LL START WITH SENATOR DOLLY THEN- WESO AND CAPITAL. SO THANK YOU THE MANAGER DO YOU DO YOU THINK YOU'LL BE ABLE TO I KNOW THIS IS GOING TO JUDICIARY AFTER THIS HEARING AND YOU KNOW LOOK.I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYBODY THAT DOESN'T. I AGREE THAT PEOPLE SHOULDN'T BE HARASSED OR- CALL IN THE MIDDLE THE NIGHT AND ALL THOSE THINGS BUT ALSO. AS OF SOME WHO OWNS YOU KNOW THESE APARTMENTS OR OR IS RUNNING OUT ALSO NEEDS THE ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO HAVE. A SOME- ACTIONS AND THAT THE STUFF THAT WAS BROUGHT UP BY- DEPARTMENT SO SHE CAN CAN YOU ADDRESS WHAT YOU THINK WHAT THE OUTCOME WILL BE A FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD ARE YOU LOOKING TO TAKE SEVEN MINUTES TO MAKE THAT- THE SCENARIOS THAT HE BROUGHT FORTH THE- THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF THE BILL- TO WHERE WE CAN MAYBE MITIGATE THAT. WELL AT AS YOU SAID- THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE. WE ADDRESSED- HAVE TO DO WITH THE PURVIEW OF THIS- COMMITTEE- AND THE POTENTIAL CONFLICTS EXIST BETWEEN THE- TENNESSEE LINE THIS BILL. OUT WE HOPE TO. ENGAGE WITH THOSE CONCERNS AND THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. TO CONTACT BETWEEN OUR STATE LAW ON THE FEDERAL LAW- YOU'RE GONNA TRY TO WORK THOSE OUT IN THE NEXT COMMITTEE. WELL WITH REGARDS TO THE TENDENCY ISSUES. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GONNA WE BELIEVE THAT THAT BELONGS IN THE PURVIEW OF THE JUDICIARY AND THAT'S WHAT WE HOPE TO TAKE IT UP. THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WE HAVE SENATOR WESSEL. THANK YOU- I FOUND I FOUND THE TESTIMONY OF THE- GENTLEMAN IN OPPOSITION PRETTY COMPELLING IN THE AREA THAT REGARD THAT DEALS WITH- TENDENCY IN POSSESSION OF A RESOURCE SO WHEN SOMEBODY IS ACTUALLY AN- OCCUPYING. YOUR RESOURCE- THAT THIS WITH THIS THIS PROVISION WOULD APPLY. AS AS HE EXPLAINED THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN CREDIT THAT AND ACTUALLY SERVICE SERVICES- WHICH THIS WOULD BE- GENERALLY IS HAVE YOU CONTEMPLATED RIGHT I THINK RIGHT NOW- THERE'S ALSO VERY COMPELLING ARGUMENTS. THAT THERE IS AN OVERWHELMING NEED RIGHT NOW TO DEAL WITH THIS. AND IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER I'D LIKE TO EXTEND THE PROTECTIONS OF HARASSMENT. OF PREVENTING HARASSMENT OF ANY DEBTOR IN ALMOST ANY CIRCUMSTANCE BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S THIRD THERE ARE THE PROPER AVENUES TO COLLECT DEBTS WITHOUT HAVING TO. HARASS PEOPLE AND I THINK GENERALLY THAT THAT IN THE BILL NEEDS TO I MEAN YOU NEED TO WORK IT OUT. BUT I THINK THERE'S GOT TO BE EITHER SOME KIND OF- MAYBE A SUNSET ON THE PROVISIONS HAVING TO DEAL WITH- WITH THE RENT COLLECTION- BECAUSE OF THE COVER CRISIS BUT GOING FORWARD I THINK THERE'S STILL NEEDS TO BE SOME SOME OVER WHAT SHE NUMBER A LOT RELATED TO HARASSMENT AND MAKING SURE THAT THAT IS NOT ALLOWED IN ANY CASE- I DON'T KNOW. TO WHAT EXTENT THAT'S SOMETHING YOU'RE- WILLING TO WORK ON IN THIS BILL AS YOU MOVE FORWARD. AND YOU KNOW I COULD DEFINITELY SEND. OUR SUGGESTIONS IN TERMS OF WHAT WE THINK IS FAIR AS WELL BUT- ARE YOU NOT HELP YOU CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS BECAUSE I THINK PROVISIONS UNTIL HARASSMENT ARE VERY REAL AND SERIOUS AND NEED TO BE. PUT IN PLACE PLACE THE PROTECTIONS AGAINST SO THANK YOU ACCESS AND ARE AVAILABLE AND THEN SENATOR PORTANTINO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR- SO I WANT IT- AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUES- THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT- THAT TENANTS. NEED TO BE PROTECTED AND SOME OF THE ACTIONS- WHICH HAVE BEEN HAPPENING FOR YEARS- NEED TO BE ENACTED SO HERE'S THE PROBLEM AND I SAID ON JUDICIARY SO I'M STRUGGLING WITH THIS BECAUSE- IT'S A REAL SERIOUS ISSUE IS THAT- IS THAT CONSUMER DEBTS PROTECTING CALIFORNIA BY TWO BY TWO THINGS ONE WHICH IS A ROSENTHAL. FAIR DEBT COLLECTION PRACTICES PRACTICES ACTS ACT WHICH WE- WROTE SPECIFICALLY TO INCLUDE ALL THE FEDERAL. PROVISIONS IN THE FAIR DEBT COLLECTION PRACTICES ACT. AND SO WE DID IT BY REFERENCE AND THEN IT BRINGS IN FEDERAL LAW WHICH WE HAVE NO ABILITY TO CONTROL- IF. NOT NOW I CAN'T SAY. THAT I KNOW WHAT ALL THE PROTECTIONS ARE IN THE FEDERAL LAW AND WHETHER THEY THEIR DUPLICATIVE OF THE STATE LAW WITH SOME ADDITIONS- BUT BUT THE STATE LAW AND THEN THE FEDERAL AYE HAS SOME REQUIREMENTS THAT THAT CONFLICT WITH OUR LANDLORD TENANT LAW I JUST THINK IT IT BECOMES A MESS BECAUSE OUR LANDLORD TENANT LAW HAS BEEN CAREFULLY CRAFTED OVER THE YEARS IT. IT IS NOT PERFECT THERE ARE ALL KINDS OF ABUSES ON BOTH SIDES OF YOU KNOW WITH TENANTS THAT DON'T RESPECT THE PROPERTY IN AND MESS IT UP AND- LANDLORDS IT A BUTTE TAKE TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE FACT THAT. WE HAVE A VACANCY RATE IN MANY OF OUR COMMUNITIES UP THAT'S VERY LOW SO THAT YOU CAN GET RID OF SOMEBODY AND FIND SOMEBODY RIGHT AWAY BECAUSE THERE'S SUCH A NEED- BUT BUT THE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED. BY BOTH THE APARTMENT ASSOCIATION- AND THE REALTORS IS ISRAEL- LANDLORDS ARE HAVE VERY SPECIFIC OBLIGATIONS. AND YOU HAVE TO DOT YOUR I'S AND CROSS YOUR KEYS AND IF YOU. S. UP THEN YOU GOT TO% START ALL OVER AGAIN AND I KNOW THIS BECAUSE- AS A AS AN ATTORNEY REPRESENTING POOR PEOPLE I USED THE LAW SUCCESSFULLY TO KEEP PEOPLE IN PLACES ARE TO GIVE THEM TIME TO BE ABLE TO MOVE. BECAUSE YOU GOT TO GET RIGHT AND SO I'M WORRIED ABOUT THE IMPACT OF- I'M WORRIED ABOUT HOW THIS AMISH'S TOGETHER BECAUSE IT'S GOT TO WORK FOR BOTH THE LANDLORD AND THE TENANT. SO THAT THEY BOTH KNOW. WHAT THE RESPONSIBILITIES ARE AND HOW. AND AND WHAT HAPPENS TO THE PROPERTY WHICH IS SEPARATE FROM. YOU OWE ME MONEY AND NOW YOU GOT TO PAY ME- SO I AM- I AM I AM NOT. I'M LISTENING I GUESS IS WHAT I'M I'M I'M GONNA SAY I WANT TO SUPPORT THIS BUT I THINK THAT THAT'S A REAL SERIOUS- FLAW IN THE IN THE IN THE WAY IT'S SET UP RIGHT NOW AND I GET IT THAT THERE'S ANOTHER HEARING BUT- BUT I. HAVEN'T HEARD THAT THERE'S SOME SOLUTIONS RIGHT NOW. AND THAT HAS ME HAS ME WORRIED THE BOTTOM LINE. THANK YOU CENTER CABALLERO NEXT DID pCENTER THAT ALSO- MAYBE I'LL JUST LEAVE IT OKAY SO. SENATOR PORTANTINO FOLLOWED BY SENATOR BRADFORD. I JUST WAS GOING TO SAY. THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD YOU KNOW. HOW MANY TIMES WE SAID THE PANDEMIC HAS HAS EXACERBATED SOMETHING WE KNEW BEFORE THE PANDEMIC AND MADE THE SITUATION INTO A MUCH MORE ACUTE AND URGENT- YOU KNOW TENANTS NEED PROTECTION THE SYSTEM NEEDS TO WORK BOTH FOR THE LANDLORDS AND THE TENANTS- THERE'S ALSO A REASON WHY WE DOUBLE REFER A BILL. AND THIS IS A AN EXAMPLE OF THAT YOU KNOW WE GET TO DEAL WITH SOME OF IT IN THIS COMMITTEE AND THEN JUDICIARY- WILL DEAL WITH THE OTHER ISSUES I THINK SOME OF THE QUESTIONS AND ISSUES THAT WERE RAISED ARE ARE REAL- AND- AS MY COLLEAGUE. FROM NORTHERN CALIFORNIA HAS MENTIONED- YOU KNOW THE FEDERAL IMPLICATIONS. YOU KNOW DO NEED TO BE WORKED OUT THIS BILL NOT ONLY GOES TO TRADITION ALSO WILL GO TO APPROACH. SO THERE'S GOING TO BE HERE TO MORE OPPORTUNITIES TO WORK WIH THE OPPOSITION TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT SOME OF THOSE NUANCES OF OBVIOUS I'M TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY IT'S IMPORTANT WORK. BE DONE BUT THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE ON THE BILL AS IT MOVES THROUGH THE NEXT TO COMMITTEES. THANK YOU SENATOR PORTANTINO SENATOR BRADFORD THING ABOUT INSURANCE I DON'T. WANT TO BE REDUNDANT BUT MY CONCERNS ARE I'VE- ARE THOSE THAT ARE VERY BEEN EXPRESSED BY MY COLLEAGUES AND- AGAIN- I THINK AS- SIR PORTANTINO STATED THESE PROBLEMS EXISTED PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC BUT THEY'VE JUST BEEN EXACERBATED AND I'VE LEARNED DURING THIS PERIOD THE NUMBER OF MY FRIENDS. WERE NOT LARGE CONGLOMERATES AND LARGE CORPORATIONS AS WELL AS ON MY COLLEAGUES FOR LANDLORDS WHO HAVE SUFFERED FROM NOT BEING ABLE TO COLLECT GRATZ BUT AT THE SAME TIME DESIRES OF KEEPING FOLKS HOUSE IN THEM ORANGE OF THAT SO ON I WILL BE VOTING FOR THIS TODAY BUT I AGAIN I THINK THERE'S SOME LEGITIMATE CONCERNS THAT HAS BEEN EXPRESSED- COMPARING. RENT WITH CREDIT THAT YOU KNOW. WHEN YOU'RE IN POSSESSION OF A PIECE OF PROPERTY VERSUS. CREDIT ON YOU KNOW ON FUTURE PAYMENTS AS YOU STATED- RAIN IS DUE IN ADVANCE VERSUS. YOU KNOW ON YOUR CREDIT YOU PAY AFTER YOU'VE- YOU KNOW OBLIGATED YOURSELF TO A CERTAIN AMOUNT SO- IT'S AN ARRESTING NEW ONES THAT WE FIND OURSELVES HERE HAVE TO GO WHAT BUT- I THINK IT'S WORK IN PROGRESS THANK YOU OTHER COMMENT. AND SO I WILL SAY M. YOU KNOW THANK YOU SENATOR DRAW SO I AM APPRECIATIVE OF THE CONVERSATIONS THAT WE STARTED- YOU KNOW BETWEEN THE OPPOSITION AND SUPPORTERS ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSE- I THINK WHAT YOU'RE HEARING FROM REALLY THE GOOD THE GREAT MAJORITY OF FOLKS IS. THAT THAT THAT THERE IS. A TRYING TO FIND AN UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN FEDERAL ISSUES AND STATE ISSUES BUT ALSO BUT WITH THE ADDED CAVIAR OUT THAT WAY- DATA FOR. A MORTGAGE IS DIFFERENT BECAUSE SOMEONE'S NOT IN THE POSSESSION OF WHAT YOU ARE. READING SO I A THINK THAT THAT'S ONE ELEMENT THAT WE HOPE THE CONVERSATIONS TO CONTINUE BUT I ALSO REALLY WANT TO SAY THAT- AT AS THE CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE I UNEQUIVOCALLY BELIEVE THAT IF YOU HAVE A DEBT FOR MORTGAGE. OBVERSES A DEBT FOR RENTERS YOU SHOULD BE GIVEN THE SAME CONSUMER PROTECTIONS- BUT UNDERSTANDING THAT THE DATA DEFINITION IT'S GOING TO BE DIFFERENT AND MAY INVOLVE. ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS- I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL- AND- I. HOPE THAT THE CONVERSATIONS I DO CONTINUE I THINK THAT IT'S GONNA BE REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE FIND A WAY. TO EXTEND THE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS FOR THE RENTERS- BUT ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT- IT THERE ARE THERE IS A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT DYNAMIC THAT IS PART OF THIS CONVERSATION. WHICH IS THAT THE RENTERS ARE LIVING IN THE PROPERTY OF SOMEBODY ELSE- AND THAT'S THE PIECE. OF RIGHT THAT'S PRETTY MEANINGFUL IN AND HOW WE THINK ABOUT THE DEBT. US SO SEEING NO FURTHER COMMENTS CENTER LASSEN WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. SURE MAYBE WITH SOME OF THE TECHNICAL- ISSUES AS FAR AS THE FEDERAL AND THE STATE COULD YOU. REMEMBER RESPOND TO THAT AND THEN I'LL AND THEN I WILL. ENSURE THAT OUR GUESTS UP VERY BRIEFLY. THE ONE OF THE- AMENDMENTS TAKEN TODAY. ARE EXPLICITLY ADDRESSES THE QUESTION OF. WHETHER OUR- THAT RENTAL THAT IS A FOR OF CONSUMER CREDIT TRENDS. AND IT DEFINES IT NOT TO BE. SO NUMBER ONE OF WHAT- THIS MEDICINE WAS DESCRIBING I THINK IS ADDRESSED BY THAT I MEAN WILL THE OBVIOUSLY HAVE TO TALK ABOUT IT BE BEEN IN CONVERSATION WILL CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT IT. THE UP WE NEED TO HAVE TO SIT DOWN AND REALLY WORK THROUGH EXACTLY WHAT IN OF THE DEBT COLLECTION PROCESS ON ONE SIDE THE UNLAWFUL DETAINER PROCESS ON THE OTHER-SIDE MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S NO CONFLICT BETWEEN THE TWO OF THEM I THINK IT WILL BE ABLE TO PRESENT. TO WORK THAT. THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU EVERYBODY AND I APPRECIATE THAT YOUR STARTING POINT WAS. ALL AGREE THAT WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING TO GIVE PROTECTIONS TO RENTERS OF THIS IS NOT ABOUT THE DEBT ITSELF FORGIVING OR COUNSELING OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT THIS IS ABOUT WHAT PRACTICES. ARE USED. BUT TO TRY TO COLLECT THAT DEBT AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS WHAT KIND OF PRACTICES YOU KNOW. MAKE SURE THEY'RE NOT ABUSIVE PRACTICES- TO PRESSURE SOMEONE uPAY THAT'S REALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE DEBT ITSELF NOT TRYING TO CANCEL THE DEBT NOT TRYING TO DEAL WITH THE DEBT IS JUST HOW DO YOU DEAL AS A LANDLORD WITH THAT TENANT AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT. AND I LIKE YOU YOU KNOW THINK ABOUT THE CONSUMER WHO TAKES ON EXCESSIVE DEBT TO PURCHASE LUXURY GOODS HAS LEGAL PROTECTIONS I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT A RENTER YOU KNOW HAS THE SAME KINDS OF PROTECTIONS WHEN IT COMES TO THE PRACTICES OF TRYING TO GET PRESSURE YOU TO PAY THAT DEBT- SO WITH THAT- AGAIN I KNOW WORLD. WE ALL HAVE THE SAME GOAL ANDWE ALL HAVE THE SENSE OF UNFAIRNESS- WE WANT TO KEEP FAMILIES IN THEIR HOMES WE DON'T WANT THEM TO GET PUSHED OUT OF ILLEGALLY BECAUSE OF THE PRACTICES THAT WERE USED BECAUSE OF ITS THAT WERE CLOSED- SO WITH THAT I- RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE AND I DO COMMIT. US SUCH AS- MR BERMAN SAID WE WILL ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF THE TENDENCY IN THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH ASK FOR YOUR VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER DRESSED SO WE HAVE A MOTION TO MOVE THE BILL BY SENATOR BRADFORD AT CAN BE PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.
