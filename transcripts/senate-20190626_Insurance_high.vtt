00:13:28.407 --> 00:13:29.675
I HAVE HEARD FROM SO MANY OF MY

00:13:32.645 --> 00:13:33.812
THEIR CONSTITUENTS.

00:13:33.879 --> 00:13:34.880
WE ARE WORKING WITH MULTIPLE

00:13:34.947 --> 00:13:36.515
ENEMIES INCLUDING FAIR PLAN TO

00:13:36.582 --> 00:13:37.816
SEE HOW WE CAN INCREASE ACCESS

00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:43.455
LIVING.

00:13:43.522 --> 00:13:44.657

00:13:50.062 --> 00:13:51.797
GROWN BY 35%.

00:13:51.864 --> 00:13:53.299
AND THAT WAS BEFORE THE LAST TO

00:13:53.365 --> 00:13:55.234

00:14:01.106 --> 00:14:01.941
AS THIS BILL MOVES THROUGH THE

00:14:02.007 --> 00:14:03.075

EXPLORE HOW WE ADDRESS THESE

00:14:06.011 --> 00:14:07.046
INSURANCE CHALLENGES.

00:14:07.112 --> 00:14:08.714
A TRUE SOLUTION MUST BE ONE THAT

00:14:08.781 --> 00:14:10.182
ENCOURAGES ACCESS TO REASONABLY

00:14:10.249 --> 00:14:11.483

CONTINUED WILDFIRES.

00:15:02.568 --> 00:15:03.335
IT WILL ENSURE THAT VICTIMS OF

00:15:05.170 --> 00:15:06.839

TIMELY MANNER.

00:15:15.147 --> 00:15:16.181
VICTIMS OF THE STATE NEED TO MAY

00:15:16.248 --> 00:15:17.683
BE MADE WHOLE AND IT SHOULD BE

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:19.118
NOT DONE AS EXPEDITIOUSLY AS

00:15:19.184 --> 00:15:20.552
POSSIBLE.

00:15:20.619 --> 00:15:21.320
ALL WHILE HOLDING UTILITIES

00:15:21.387 --> 00:15:23.122
ACCOUNTABLE AND NOT AT THE

EXPENSE OF REPAIRS.

00:15:24.957 --> 00:15:25.824
I KNOW THEY'RE STILL MANY

00:15:25.891 --> 00:15:27.192
CONVERSATIONS THAT NEED TO BE

00:15:27.259 --> 00:15:28.394

WORKING WITH ALL OF YOU AS WE

00:15:29.695 --> 00:15:31.063
CONTINUE THIS WORK.

00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:32.965
THE GOAL FIRST AND FOREMOST OF

00:15:33.032 --> 00:15:34.433
ANY WILDFIRE FUND SHOULD SHOULD

00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:36.835
BE TO PROTECT ALL CURRENT AND

00:15:36.902 --> 00:15:38.137
FIX FUTURE VICTIMS.

00:15:38.203 --> 00:15:39.605
STABLING UTILITIES SHOULD BE A

00:15:39.672 --> 00:15:42.007
BY PRODUCT OF WHATEVER WE DO NOT

00:15:42.074 --> 00:15:43.475
THE FOCUS.

00:15:43.542 --> 00:15:44.843
I BELIEVE IF WE CONSIDER ALL

00:15:44.910 --> 00:15:46.512
OPTIONS THROUGH THAT LENS WILL

00:15:46.578 --> 00:15:48.480
ARRIVE AT A SOLUTION THAT WE CAN

00:15:48.547 --> 00:15:49.815
ALL STAND BEHIND.

00:15:49.882 --> 00:15:51.250
WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ACOSTA

00:15:51.317 --> 00:15:54.420
NIGHT OF THANK YOU ANYBODY ELSE

00:15:57.990 --> 00:15:59.925
THE NO INTEREST ANYONE WISHING

00:15:59.992 --> 00:16:03.062
TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION.

00:16:03.128 --> 00:16:05.197
MEMBERS HAVE ANY QUESTIONS.

00:16:05.264 --> 00:16:06.899
MR MORE LUCK THE MOTHER MISTER

00:16:06.965 --> 00:16:09.068
ARCHULETA.

00:16:09.134 --> 00:16:12.571
SOON BURKE I'M REALLY -- REALLY

00:16:12.638 --> 00:16:13.539
PLEASED TO SEE THIS BILL THANK

00:16:13.605 --> 00:16:16.875
YOU THANK YOU I I I SIDE JUST A

00:16:16.942 --> 00:16:18.444
FEW QUESTIONS BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY

00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:19.678
YOU'VE GOT YOUR BILL AND NOW

00:16:19.745 --> 00:16:20.946
WE'VE GOT SOMETHING THAT CAME

00:16:21.013 --> 00:16:23.215
OUT FRIDAY AND WE GOT EVERYBODY.

00:16:23.282 --> 00:16:24.583
GOT THE COURT CAME OUT WITH

00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:27.853
SOMETHING YESTERDAY AND SO MAYBE

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:29.655
JUST TO HAVE SOME DISCUSSION.

00:16:29.722 --> 00:16:30.956
I SERVED ON THE BUDGET

00:16:31.023 --> 00:16:31.557
CONFERENCE COMMITTEE I DIDN'T

00:16:31.623 --> 00:16:32.991
SEE ONE DOLLAR.

00:16:33.058 --> 00:16:34.560
OR OR OR ONE DOLLAR DAHLE TO SET

00:16:34.626 --> 00:16:36.962
UP A FUND OR VICTIMS FOUNDER OR

00:16:37.029 --> 00:16:38.997
OR EVEN ALLOCATE OR DEDICATE

00:16:39.064 --> 00:16:41.433
WHO'S WHO IT'S GOING TO BE -- SO

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:43.502
YOURS YOU'RE REQUESTING FIVE

00:16:43.569 --> 00:16:45.304
HUNDRED MILLION.

00:16:45.371 --> 00:16:47.106
RIGHT FROM THE BUDGET.

00:16:47.172 --> 00:16:48.340
ODD WHICH WHICH IS A BOLD MOVE

00:16:48.407 --> 00:16:49.875
SO COULD YOU EXPLAIN THAT AND

00:16:49.942 --> 00:16:51.443
WHY DON'T WE SEE IT IN THE IN

00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:53.145
THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET -- I CAN'T

00:16:53.212 --> 00:16:55.080
EXPLAIN WHY WE DON'T SEE IN THE

00:16:55.147 --> 00:16:55.647
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET BECAUSE I

00:16:55.714 --> 00:16:57.750
THINK -- I I CAN'T EXPLAIN WHY

00:16:57.816 --> 00:16:58.517
WE DON'T SEE THE GOVERNOR'S

00:16:58.584 --> 00:17:00.152
BUDGET BUT I CAN TELL YOU IS IT

00:17:00.219 --> 00:17:02.221
YES IT IS A BOLD MOVE BUT WE DO

00:17:02.287 --> 00:17:03.956
HAVE CURRENT WILD FIRE VICTIMS

00:17:04.022 --> 00:17:06.158
AND THE STATE DOES HOLD SOME

00:17:06.225 --> 00:17:07.726
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT.

00:17:07.793 --> 00:17:09.261
AND I EIGHT BELIEVE THAT THERE'S

00:17:09.328 --> 00:17:10.529
SOMETHING SHOULD BE THAT WE

00:17:10.596 --> 00:17:11.830
SHOULD TAKE SOME RESPONSIBILITY

00:17:11.897 --> 00:17:15.167
AND I THINK THE 200-017-2000

00:17:15.234 --> 00:17:15.734
EIGHTEEN WHILE FIRE VICTIMS

00:17:15.801 --> 00:17:18.203
DESERVE THAT -- AND SO FOR ME

00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:21.173
THAT WAS A AN ALLOCATION THAT I

00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:22.007
BELIEVED WAS.

00:17:22.074 --> 00:17:23.375
A SHO OF OUR SOME OF OUR

00:17:23.442 --> 00:17:24.643
RESPONSIBILITY.

00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:26.145
OF THE STATE WANTS TO USE MORE

00:17:26.211 --> 00:17:28.147
ELECTRICITY YOU KNOW WE WANT TO

00:17:28.213 --> 00:17:29.882
CHARGE CARS AND TRUCKS AND AND

00:17:29.948 --> 00:17:30.883
SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO HELP

00:17:30.949 --> 00:17:32.251
UTILITIES TO BUILD THAT

00:17:32.317 --> 00:17:34.920
INFRASTRUCTURE SO I THINK THAT'S

00:17:34.987 --> 00:17:35.921
A GOOD MOVE IN KIND OF KIND OF

00:17:35.988 --> 00:17:36.455
ART.

00:17:36.522 --> 00:17:38.056
THANKS FOR BROACHING THANK YOU --

00:17:38.123 --> 00:17:39.858
THE SECOND WAS A SURCHARGE ON

00:17:39.925 --> 00:17:43.395
RATE PAYERS.

00:17:43.462 --> 00:17:44.630
THAT CONCLUDES.

00:17:44.696 --> 00:17:45.431
IN TWENTY TWENTY SO COULD YOU

00:17:45.497 --> 00:17:46.999
EXPLAIN.

00:17:47.065 --> 00:17:49.134
SO MY VIEW WAS -- I DIDN'T

00:17:49.201 --> 00:17:50.502
WANTED AND TO INCREASE --

00:17:50.569 --> 00:17:51.804
OBVIOUSLY A VERY SENSITIVE I

00:17:51.870 --> 00:17:53.372
COME FROM A LOW INCOME COMMUNITY

00:17:53.439 --> 00:17:55.374
AND SO OBVIOUSLY MY INTENTION

00:17:55.441 --> 00:17:57.276
WAS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DIDN'T

00:17:57.342 --> 00:17:59.144
SEE AN INCREASE AND REPAIR --

00:17:59.211 --> 00:18:01.146
BILLS HOWEVER WE HAVE SPENT A

00:18:01.213 --> 00:18:02.614
LOT OF TIME LOOKING AND TALKING

00:18:02.681 --> 00:18:04.183
TO THE COMMERCIAL REPAIRS AS

00:18:04.249 --> 00:18:06.185
WELL BECAUSE D. W. R. FEES WERE

00:18:06.251 --> 00:18:08.287
WERE CREATED AS A RESULT OF THE

00:18:08.353 --> 00:18:11.023
ENERGY CRISIS AND SO -- WE'RE

00:18:11.089 --> 00:18:12.991
NOT WE DON'T ACTUALLY OUR GROUP

00:18:13.058 --> 00:18:14.993
OF CO AUTHORS BELIEVES THAT --

00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:16.595
THAT THEY DON'T HOLD THE SAME

00:18:16.662 --> 00:18:18.063
WAY BUT YET THEY STILL DO USE --

00:18:18.130 --> 00:18:19.798
LIKE TRICITY AND SO AS WE LOOK

00:18:19.865 --> 00:18:21.934
AT USING D. W. R. FUNDS AS WE

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:22.901
ARE LOOKING THROUGH THE LENS AND

00:18:22.968 --> 00:18:24.403
WORKING WITH STAKEHOLDERS TO

00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:25.737
HAVE THE CONVERSATION OF WHAT

00:18:25.804 --> 00:18:27.506
PROPORTION OF THAT WE WOULD

00:18:27.573 --> 00:18:29.041
REDUCE FOR COMING COMMERCIAL

00:18:29.107 --> 00:18:30.409
RATE PAYERS BECAUSE THEY HAVE A

00:18:30.476 --> 00:18:31.376
DIFFERENT.

00:18:31.443 --> 00:18:33.412
LEVEL OF RESPONSIBILITY HERE WE

00:18:33.479 --> 00:18:34.680
ALL HAVE RESPONSIBILITY BUT THEY

00:18:34.746 --> 00:18:35.180
HAVE A LITTLE DIFFERENT

00:18:35.247 --> 00:18:36.949
RESPONSIBILITY THAN THEY DID IN

00:18:37.015 --> 00:18:38.917
THE ORIGINAL D. W. R. FEES.

00:18:38.984 --> 00:18:41.386
IN THE LAST TWO QUESTIONS ONE IS --

00:18:41.453 --> 00:18:43.889
VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTIONS -- IS

00:18:43.956 --> 00:18:48.727
THAT REALISTIC AND THEN -- TO

00:18:48.794 --> 00:18:49.261
CAN YOU COMMENT ON WHAT'S

00:18:49.328 --> 00:18:50.596
HAPPENING IN THE FEDERAL

00:18:50.662 --> 00:18:52.397
BANKRUPTCY COURT.

00:18:52.464 --> 00:18:54.166
AND HOW COULD THIS BILL HELPS.

00:18:54.233 --> 00:18:56.435
THOSE EFFORTS -- SO I WOULD SAY

00:18:56.502 --> 00:18:58.537
THE THE VOLUNTARY YES I DO THINK

00:18:58.604 --> 00:18:59.838
IT'S POSSIBLE I THINK WITH THE

00:18:59.905 --> 00:19:01.206
COMPLETE PACKAGE I THINK THAT

00:19:01.273 --> 00:19:02.774
THE I'LL USE AND THE PO USE WILL

00:19:02.841 --> 00:19:04.176
SEE THE BENEFIT OF PARTICIPATING

00:19:04.243 --> 00:19:06.645
IN A FUND AND SO -- I THINK THAT

00:19:06.712 --> 00:19:07.980
THE GOAL IS TO USE A CARROT AND

00:19:08.046 --> 00:19:09.882
A STICK AT FIRST OF THAT SO WILL

00:19:09.948 --> 00:19:11.083
WE WE CAN DO IT.

00:19:11.149 --> 00:19:13.118
A AND SO AS OF AT THIS TIME I

00:19:13.185 --> 00:19:14.520
HAVEN'T GOTTEN A LOT OF PUSH

00:19:14.586 --> 00:19:16.355
BACK ON THE CONTRIBUTION.

00:19:16.421 --> 00:19:18.924
FROM THE I'LL USE OR THE PO USE --

00:19:18.991 --> 00:19:21.293
HOW DOES THIS HELP WITH THE --

00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:23.028
WITH THE BANKRUPTCY.

00:19:23.095 --> 00:19:24.296
I DON'T HAVE AN ACTUAL ANSWER

00:19:24.363 --> 00:19:26.131
FOR THAT I DO KNOW OBVIOUSLY

00:19:26.198 --> 00:19:27.666
THERE ARE THOSE WHO HAVE PUT IN

00:19:27.733 --> 00:19:28.367
WHO HAVE FILED WITH THE

00:19:28.433 --> 00:19:30.469
BANKRUPTCY COURT THAT SUPPORT OF

00:19:30.536 --> 00:19:33.005
FUND -- AND ARE WILLING TO

00:19:33.071 --> 00:19:34.473
PARTICIPATE ON THE BEHALF OF P.

00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:36.375
JEANNIE FOR THAT PLAN -- AND SO

00:19:36.441 --> 00:19:40.445
I THINK THAT'S KIND OF A MOVE IN

00:19:40.512 --> 00:19:41.480
THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

00:19:41.547 --> 00:19:42.347
AND IT SHOWS THAT A FUND IS

00:19:42.414 --> 00:19:43.515
NEEDED AND THAT THOSE WHO ARE --

00:19:43.582 --> 00:19:44.783
TO PARTICIPATE IN P. JEANNIE

00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:46.051
UNDERSTAND THAT THAT THEY DO

00:19:46.118 --> 00:19:47.386
HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL

00:19:47.452 --> 00:19:49.221
RESPONSIBILITY WHEN IT COMES TO

00:19:49.288 --> 00:19:50.656
WHAT THAT FUND LOOKS LIKE.

00:19:50.722 --> 00:19:51.590
THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU

00:19:51.657 --> 00:19:52.391
VENTURE THANK YOU MISTER

00:19:52.457 --> 00:19:55.027
ARCHULETA.

00:19:55.093 --> 00:19:56.762
THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND THANK

00:19:56.828 --> 00:19:58.130
YOU FOR BRITTANY'S BUILDINGS

00:19:58.196 --> 00:19:59.731
EXCELLENT EXCITED THAT IT'S HERE

00:19:59.798 --> 00:20:01.466
AND WE'RE FINALLY DOING

00:20:01.533 --> 00:20:02.968
SOMETHING. FOR SO MANY

00:20:03.035 --> 00:20:04.369
HOMEOWNERS IN AND THE STATE A

00:20:04.436 --> 00:20:05.771
CALIFORNIA.

00:20:05.837 --> 00:20:07.072
A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS IMAGINE

00:20:07.139 --> 00:20:08.540
THE MECHANISM WILL WILL

00:20:08.607 --> 00:20:11.476
REIMBURSE -- THE INSURANCE

00:20:11.543 --> 00:20:13.812
COMPANIES ARE HOMEOWNERS AND AND

00:20:13.879 --> 00:20:15.948
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WITH THE

00:20:16.014 --> 00:20:17.215
CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES.

00:20:17.282 --> 00:20:18.650
AND YOU MENTION FIVE HUNDRED

00:20:18.717 --> 00:20:20.452
MILLION DOLLARS AT WHAT POINT.

00:20:20.519 --> 00:20:21.920
IS IT CLASSIFIED FOR

00:20:21.987 --> 00:20:23.055
REIMBURSEMENT.

00:20:23.121 --> 00:20:24.790
SO RIGHT NOW WE HAVEN'T DEFINED

00:20:24.856 --> 00:20:26.458
WHAT CATASTROPHIC MEANS AND THE

00:20:26.525 --> 00:20:28.460
BILL YET -- AND WE'VE DONE THAT

00:20:28.527 --> 00:20:30.729
ON PURPOSE BECAUSE AS THE BILL

00:20:30.796 --> 00:20:31.897
CONTINUES TO MOVE AND CHANGE OUT

00:20:31.964 --> 00:20:33.165
WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE WILL MOVING

00:20:33.231 --> 00:20:34.866
CHANGE WE DO ASK THAT THE

00:20:34.933 --> 00:20:36.168
INSURANCE THAT THE UTILITIES DO

00:20:36.234 --> 00:20:38.303
TAKE UP MORE INSURANCE.

00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:39.638
AND THAT THEY ARE -- MORE CORING

00:20:39.705 --> 00:20:41.139
MORE THAN THAN TRADITIONAL TEN

00:20:41.206 --> 00:20:43.141
MILLION DOLLARS OF DEDUCTIBLE WE

00:20:43.208 --> 00:20:43.742
RAISE THAT TWO HUNDRED MILLION

00:20:43.809 --> 00:20:44.676
DOLLARS.

00:20:44.743 --> 00:20:46.178
WE BELIEVE THAT IF WE RAISE THE

00:20:46.244 --> 00:20:48.747
INSURANCE TO WHAT IS POSSIBLE IN

00:20:48.814 --> 00:20:50.015
THE MARKET AND TO BUY IT ON

00:20:50.082 --> 00:20:51.516
DESPITE SIZE OF THE SIZE OF THE

00:20:51.583 --> 00:20:53.051
MARKET OF EACH UTILITY.

00:20:53.118 --> 00:20:54.553
WHAT QUALIFIES FOR CATASTROPHIC

00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:56.555
WILDFIRE WILL BE ADJUSTED FOR

00:20:56.622 --> 00:20:59.391
SOMEONE WHO HAS 10% OF THE

00:20:59.458 --> 00:21:00.459
FOR WILDFIRE IS DIFFERENT THAN

00:21:00.525 --> 00:21:01.627
SOMEONE LIKE A P. JEANNIE WHO

00:21:01.693 --> 00:21:03.228
HAS A LARGER PERCENTAGE OF THE

00:21:03.295 --> 00:21:04.162
MARKET AND SO WE'RE STILL

00:21:04.229 --> 00:21:05.998
WORKING? TO DEFEAT USE I REALLY

00:21:06.064 --> 00:21:07.399
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN WE

00:21:07.466 --> 00:21:09.101
DEFINE WHAT CATASTROPHIC IS THAT

00:21:09.167 --> 00:21:09.701
IT IS.

00:21:09.768 --> 00:21:11.770
SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED FOR THE

00:21:11.837 --> 00:21:13.639
ENTIRE STATE -- IT IS NOT

00:21:13.705 --> 00:21:14.506
SOMETHING THAT WE'LL BE ABLE TO

00:21:14.573 --> 00:21:15.941
SLAP I DON'T BELIEVE WILL BE

00:21:16.008 --> 00:21:17.676
ABLE TO SLAP A ONE NUMBER ON A

00:21:17.743 --> 00:21:19.578
ONE SIZE FITS ALL FOR THE ENTIRE

00:21:19.645 --> 00:21:20.245
STATE I DON'T THINK THAT'S GOING

00:21:20.312 --> 00:21:20.679
TO BE APPROPRIATE.

00:21:20.746 --> 00:21:22.214
IT COULD BE THE SIZE OF THE FIRE

00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:24.416
THE THE NUMBER OF BUILDINGS IN

00:21:24.483 --> 00:21:25.817
THE AND THE THE LOSS AND THE

00:21:25.884 --> 00:21:32.991
MARKET SHARE OF THAT UTILITY.

00:21:33.058 --> 00:21:34.726
THERE YOU GO OKAY THANK YOU

00:21:34.793 --> 00:21:35.027
[inaudible]

00:21:35.093 --> 00:21:36.561
START.

00:21:36.628 --> 00:21:37.863
THANK YOU IN.

00:21:37.929 --> 00:21:39.197
AND THANK YOU AS SOMEONE THAT I

00:21:39.264 --> 00:21:41.099
I APPRECIATE YOUR LEADERSHIP ON

00:21:41.166 --> 00:21:42.501
THIS SITE JOIN IN THAT TOUR

00:21:42.567 --> 00:21:45.003
PARADISE I THINK WE ALSO OFFER

00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:46.238
CELLS WHAT A HORRIBLE.

00:21:46.304 --> 00:21:47.739
SITUATION IT IS IN THE FACT THAT

00:21:47.806 --> 00:21:48.707
THIS BILL COMES OUT OF YOUR

00:21:48.774 --> 00:21:50.275
CONCERN AND COMPASSION FOR THE

00:21:50.342 --> 00:21:51.943
VICTIMS IS THE RIGHT PLACE TO BE

00:21:52.010 --> 00:21:54.780
LOOKING AT THIS ISSUE AND AT

00:21:54.846 --> 00:21:55.747
THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF

00:21:55.814 --> 00:21:57.315
QUESTIONS THAT ARE RAISED HERE

00:21:57.382 --> 00:21:59.184
AND I I KNOW THAT THIS IS.

00:21:59.251 --> 00:22:00.419
A YOU THE KNOWLEDGE A WORK IN

00:22:00.485 --> 00:22:02.154
PROGRESS AND I KNOW WITH THAT

00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:02.754
WE'RE HEARING FROM THE

00:22:02.821 --> 00:22:04.189
ADMINISTRATION THAT THEY WANT TO

00:22:04.256 --> 00:22:06.425
BE IN THIS -- IT SOMEWHERE IN

00:22:06.491 --> 00:22:08.460
THIS SPACE AND SO I DO HAVE

00:22:08.527 --> 00:22:09.861
QUESTIONS AND THEIR SUBSTANTIAL

00:22:09.928 --> 00:22:11.897
QUESTIONS BUT I AND I APPRECIATE

00:22:11.963 --> 00:22:13.265
THAT WE WANT TO MOVE THE BILL

00:22:13.331 --> 00:22:14.366
FORD I GUESS IT JUST.

00:22:14.433 --> 00:22:16.601
GIVES ME SOME PAUSE THAT WE

00:22:16.668 --> 00:22:17.536
SHOULD.

00:22:17.602 --> 00:22:18.203
TAKE THE TIME FOR SOME OF THESE

00:22:18.270 --> 00:22:20.038
THAT YOU MAY OR MAY NOT BE ABLE

00:22:20.105 --> 00:22:23.075
TO ANSWER TODAY BUT CERTAINLY

00:22:23.141 --> 00:22:24.042
THE I'VE.

00:22:24.109 --> 00:22:25.677
THE WHOLE VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTION

00:22:25.744 --> 00:22:27.212
LIMIT FROM UTILITIES AND

00:22:27.279 --> 00:22:28.747
NOBODY'S COME HERE TO TESTIFY

00:22:28.814 --> 00:22:29.815
FOR THE UTILITIES.

00:22:29.881 --> 00:22:31.216
SO IF THEY'RE HAPPY ARE NOT

00:22:31.283 --> 00:22:32.184
HAPPY THEY'RE NOT REALLY SAYING

00:22:32.250 --> 00:22:33.518
ANYTHING WELL WE KNOW THE LET'S

00:22:33.585 --> 00:22:35.954
SAY A LOT WHEN THEY'RE NOT HAPPY

00:22:36.021 --> 00:22:37.456
DON'T THEY THAT IS TRUE.

00:22:37.522 --> 00:22:39.324
BUT MAYBE -- YOU KNOW THERE IS A

00:22:39.391 --> 00:22:39.858
QUESTION ABOUT WHY YOU'RE

00:22:39.925 --> 00:22:41.393
LIMITING YOU KNOW THE THE

00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:42.928
DAMAGES THAT HAVE BEEN COSTS ARE

00:22:42.994 --> 00:22:44.930
SIGNIFICANTLY MORE THAN WHAT I

00:22:44.996 --> 00:22:45.564
THINK YOU'RE TRYING TO RAISE IN

00:22:45.630 --> 00:22:46.698
THIS BILL.

00:22:46.765 --> 00:22:47.999
YOU'RE ONLY ASKING UTILITIES TO

00:22:48.066 --> 00:22:49.968
COME UP WITH A FIVE BILLION

00:22:50.035 --> 00:22:52.170
DOLLAR TOTAL IS THAT RIGHT RIGHT

00:22:52.237 --> 00:22:53.638
BUT IT'SNOT BECAUSE THAT'S THE

00:22:53.705 --> 00:22:54.806
TOTAL AMOUNT WE BELIEVE THE FUND

00:22:54.873 --> 00:22:57.676
WILL NEED -- WE ALSO CAN BOND ON

00:22:57.743 --> 00:22:59.377
THE FINDING WITH BETWEEN D. W.

00:22:59.444 --> 00:23:00.946
R. FEES AND THE UTILITIES

00:23:01.012 --> 00:23:02.547
CONTRIBUTION WITH BONDS AND

00:23:02.614 --> 00:23:04.282
INSURANCE WE BELIEVE WE CAN GET

00:23:04.349 --> 00:23:05.383
THAT THAT THE FUND WOULD REACH

00:23:05.450 --> 00:23:07.018
ABOUT A TWENTY FIVE BILLION

00:23:07.085 --> 00:23:07.853
DOLLAR MARK.

00:23:07.919 --> 00:23:09.020
BUT PART OF WHAT WHAT YOU'RE

00:23:09.087 --> 00:23:10.021
TRYING TO I KNOW THIS ISN'T THE

00:23:10.088 --> 00:23:13.125
FISCAL CONNECTICUT OKAY SO I

00:23:13.191 --> 00:23:13.759
UNDERSTAND THAT BUT PART OF WHAT

00:23:13.825 --> 00:23:13.992
YOU'RE.

00:23:14.059 --> 00:23:15.594
TRYING TO DO IS TO MAKE SURE

00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:16.695
THAT THERE'S AN A PORTION THAT

00:23:16.762 --> 00:23:17.729
ARE WE'RE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND

00:23:17.796 --> 00:23:19.364
THAT A PORTION AND AND AND

00:23:19.431 --> 00:23:21.566
WHETHER OR NOT -- THOSE WHO ARE

00:23:21.633 --> 00:23:22.667
REALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE

00:23:22.734 --> 00:23:24.069
PROBLEM ARE THE ONES WHO ARE

00:23:24.136 --> 00:23:25.604
STEPPING UP RIGHT ABSOLUTELY AND

00:23:25.670 --> 00:23:28.173
SO -- OBVIOUSLY THE THE FIVE

00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:29.374
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR.

00:23:29.441 --> 00:23:31.676
ANNUAL CONTRIBUTION FROM THE

00:23:31.743 --> 00:23:33.245
STATE IS A VERY GENEROUS THING --

00:23:33.311 --> 00:23:34.880
BUT IT DOES RAISE THE QUESTION

00:23:34.946 --> 00:23:36.214
AS TO WHETHER WE WE SHOULD BE

00:23:36.281 --> 00:23:38.016
PAYING VERSES THE UTILITY SHOULD

00:23:38.083 --> 00:23:39.217
BE PAYING WHO HAVE BEEN FOUND AT

00:23:39.284 --> 00:23:40.118
FAULT RIGHT AND I WOULD AGREE

00:23:40.185 --> 00:23:41.720
WITH YOU AND I THINK WHEN WE

00:23:41.787 --> 00:23:43.255
FIRST STARTED WORKING ON THIS

00:23:43.321 --> 00:23:44.856
BILL WE ACTUALLY WERE HOPING TO

00:23:44.923 --> 00:23:46.925
COVER BOTH -- UTILITY BECAUSE

00:23:46.992 --> 00:23:48.293
WILDFIRES AND NON UTILITY

00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:50.295
BECAUSE WHILE BUYERS AND WE FELT

00:23:50.362 --> 00:23:51.229
THAT WE WERE ORIGINALLY DOING

00:23:51.296 --> 00:23:53.098
THE ONGOING CONTRIBUTION FOR

00:23:53.165 --> 00:23:54.032
THOSE THAT WERE NOT UTILITY

00:23:54.099 --> 00:23:55.333
BECAUSE WHILE BUYERS AS WE'VE

00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:57.035
HAD THE CONVERSATION WE'RE

00:23:57.102 --> 00:23:58.036
STARTING TO BELIEVE THAT IT MAY

00:23:58.103 --> 00:23:59.004
BE.

00:23:59.070 --> 00:24:00.605
MORE REALISTIC TO ONLY DO IT

00:24:00.672 --> 00:24:01.907
UTILITY BECAUSE WILD FIRES AND

00:24:01.973 --> 00:24:03.708
SO WE ARE LOOKING AT AND I WOULD

00:24:03.775 --> 00:24:04.810
AGREE WITH YOU AND SO WE ARE

00:24:04.876 --> 00:24:06.912
LOOKING AT WHAT THAT ONGOING IF

00:24:06.978 --> 00:24:08.480
WE CONTINUE THAT ON GOING.

00:24:08.547 --> 00:24:13.585
THIS BILL HAS BEEN WRITTEN --

00:24:13.652 --> 00:24:14.486
FOR FOR NINE UTILITY COSTS WHILE

00:24:14.553 --> 00:24:15.587
THEY'RE BOTH ORIGINALLY WE WROTE

00:24:15.654 --> 00:24:17.489
THE BILL FOR BOTH SO IT WAS FOR

00:24:17.556 --> 00:24:19.124
UTILITY AND NON UTILITY BECAUSE

00:24:19.191 --> 00:24:20.959
WILDFIRE AND THE PORTION FOR

00:24:21.026 --> 00:24:22.594
CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA WAS CAN

00:24:22.661 --> 00:24:23.094
CUT.

00:24:23.161 --> 00:24:24.696
CONTRIBUTING WAS BECAUSE NOT ALL

00:24:24.763 --> 00:24:26.932
ONLY 10% OF WILDFIRES OF THESE

00:24:26.998 --> 00:24:27.899
LARGE WHY FIVE CAST OF

00:24:27.966 --> 00:24:28.433
WILDFLOWERS ARE CAUSED BY

00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:29.434
UTILITIES.

00:24:29.501 --> 00:24:33.471
AND SO IF IT WERE GOING TO BE.

00:24:33.538 --> 00:24:33.972
FOR NINE UTILITY BECAUSE

00:24:34.039 --> 00:24:36.041
WILDFIRES OBVIOUSLY WE CAN ASK

00:24:36.107 --> 00:24:38.243
UTILITIES TO PAY THE BURDEN FOR

00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:39.778
NON UTILITY BECAUSE WILD FIRES

00:24:39.845 --> 00:24:40.779
AND SO.

00:24:40.846 --> 00:24:41.947
THAT'S WHEN WE ORIGINALLY HAD

00:24:42.013 --> 00:24:43.048
DISCUSSED THE FIVE HUNDRED

00:24:43.114 --> 00:24:44.783
MILLION ON GOING I THINK SINCE

00:24:44.850 --> 00:24:46.218
THEN WE HAVE STARTED HOW THE

00:24:46.284 --> 00:24:47.586
CONVERSATION ABOUT WHETHER WE

00:24:47.652 --> 00:24:48.453
WILL MAKE AND THAT WE ARE

00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:49.521
CONSIDERING AN ADJUSTMENT TO

00:24:49.588 --> 00:24:51.122
THAT BECAUSE I DO AGREE THAT

00:24:51.189 --> 00:24:52.991
THAT IS A LARGE.

00:24:53.058 --> 00:24:54.125
ON GOING CONTRIBUTION.

00:24:54.192 --> 00:24:55.493
RIGHT BUT AS I UNDERSTAND YOUR

00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:57.529
BILL THIS IS A SEVENTEEN

00:24:57.596 --> 00:24:58.663
EIGHTEEN WILD FIRE VICTIMS BUILT

00:24:58.730 --> 00:25:00.932
RIGHT NOW THIS IS A CURRENT AN

VICTIM'S GROUPS AND THINGS LIKE

00:26:33.124 --> 00:26:34.859
THAT IT WAS A SUGGESTION FROM

THEM THAT THEY FELT STRONGLY

00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:36.728
THAT THAT WOULD.

00:26:36.795 --> 00:26:38.163

THEM BECAUSE THEY ARE FACING

00:26:41.499 --> 00:26:42.767
BECAUSE OF CERTAIN THINGS LIKE

00:26:42.834 --> 00:26:44.102
P. JEANNIE AND AND BEING A

00:26:44.169 --> 00:26:45.704
BANKRUPTCY THAT THEY'RE FACING

00:26:45.770 --> 00:26:46.471
SOME CHALLENGE THAT

00:26:46.538 --> 00:26:48.106
TRADITIONALLY OF VICTIMS GROUP

00:26:48.173 --> 00:26:48.873
WOULD NOT FACE.

00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:50.208
AMEND THAT PHILIP FIVE HUNDRED

00:26:50.275 --> 00:26:51.276
MILLION DOLLARS JUST TO HELP

00:26:51.343 --> 00:26:53.311
OFFSET A PORTION OF THEM.

00:26:53.378 --> 00:26:54.479
OKAY THAT THAT'S CLEAR TO ME

00:26:54.546 --> 00:26:55.914
OKAY ON A PHILOSOPHICAL LEVEL I

00:26:55.981 --> 00:26:57.115
AGREE WITH WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO

00:26:57.182 --> 00:26:58.550
DO GOING FORWARD.

00:26:58.616 --> 00:27:00.018
WITH A CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRE

00:27:00.085 --> 00:27:03.121
RELIEF FUND WITH VARIOUS

00:27:03.188 --> 00:27:04.389
COMPONENTS.

00:27:04.456 --> 00:27:04.990
BUT GOING BACKWARDS OBVIOUSLY

00:27:05.056 --> 00:27:06.558
IT'S A GREAT THING TO DO AND I

00:27:06.624 --> 00:27:07.225
UNDERSTAND WHY YOU WOULD WANT TO

00:27:07.292 --> 00:27:08.059
DO IT.

00:27:08.126 --> 00:27:09.794
IT'S NOT CLEAR TO ME THAN IF THE

00:27:09.861 --> 00:27:11.463
UTILITIES ARE AT FAULT. FOR

00:27:11.529 --> 00:27:13.498
THOSE FIRES AND SEVENTEEN

00:27:13.565 --> 00:27:14.766
EIGHTEEN DOES THE GENERAL FUND

00:27:14.833 --> 00:27:17.202
GET PAID BACK FOR THAT MONEY --

00:27:17.268 --> 00:27:18.636
I CAN SEE A POTENTIAL OF IN

00:27:18.703 --> 00:27:20.171
GENERAL FINE BEING PAID BACK FOR

00:27:20.238 --> 00:27:21.506
ALTHOUGH WE HAVE NOT GONE INTO

00:27:21.573 --> 00:27:23.074
THE DEEP DISCUSSIONS ON THAT

00:27:23.141 --> 00:27:23.641
FIVE HUNDRED MILLION I THINK

00:27:23.708 --> 00:27:24.809
THAT WAS FROM A RECENT

00:27:24.876 --> 00:27:26.478
STAKEHOLDER MEETING THAT WE HAD

00:27:26.544 --> 00:27:27.512
WHERE.

00:27:27.579 --> 00:27:28.513
WE HAD WE HAD WITH THE REPAIRS

00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:31.016
THAT WE HAD DECIDED TO MOVE

00:27:31.082 --> 00:27:32.283
FORWARD ON MOVING THAT.

00:27:32.350 --> 00:27:33.852
FIVE HUNDRED MILLION TO OKAY

00:27:33.918 --> 00:27:35.487
WELL AT LEAST THE ONE PERSON'S

00:27:35.553 --> 00:27:36.254
PERSPECTIVE WOULD BE WE WOULD

00:27:36.321 --> 00:27:38.456
HELP THAT -- THE STATE WOULD BE

00:27:38.523 --> 00:27:39.624
A YOU KNOW THAT WOULD THAT AND

00:27:39.691 --> 00:27:43.495
THE VERY IDEA STATE OBLIGATION.

00:27:43.561 --> 00:27:44.462
AT FOR THE USE THAT THE UTILITY

00:27:44.529 --> 00:27:45.363
ILLEGALITY BECAUSE WILDFIRE

00:27:45.430 --> 00:27:47.232
ARSON AND I CAN APPRECIATE THAT

00:27:47.298 --> 00:27:49.868
AND I I TAKE THAT NO SERIOUSLY

00:27:49.934 --> 00:27:50.168
[inaudible]

00:27:50.235 --> 00:27:55.106
OKAY -- AND AND SO THIS THIS

00:27:55.173 --> 00:27:57.442
PROPSAL WOULD BE GOOD IF.

00:27:57.509 --> 00:27:58.910
THERE'S TWO QUESTIONS ABOUT THE

00:27:58.977 --> 00:28:00.779
WHAT THE RATE PAYERS PAY I GET

00:28:00.845 --> 00:28:03.014
IT IS ABOUT THIRTY DOLLARS A

00:28:03.081 --> 00:28:03.615
MONTH A THIRTY DOLLARS A YEAR

00:28:03.681 --> 00:28:04.215
RIGHT.

00:28:04.282 --> 00:28:05.483
THAT'S THE COST OF THIS BILL

00:28:05.550 --> 00:28:07.252
WOULD -- ADVANCE OVER THE COURSE

00:28:07.318 --> 00:28:08.820
OF THE NEXT TEN OR TWENTY YEARS

00:28:08.887 --> 00:28:11.056
TO BUILD THIS WILDLIFE WILDFIRE

00:28:11.122 --> 00:28:12.424
A PORTION OF THE FINE.

00:28:12.490 --> 00:28:13.591
GUY BUT THAT'S WHAT THE IT

00:28:13.658 --> 00:28:14.492
PEOPLE SAID HOW MUCH DOES THIS

00:28:14.559 --> 00:28:16.661
COST PEOPLE IN MY DISTRICT AND

00:28:16.728 --> 00:28:17.829
YOUR DISTRICT IT'S IT'S THE SAME

00:28:17.896 --> 00:28:19.264
APPROXIMATELY AND LESSER LOW

00:28:19.330 --> 00:28:21.232
INCOME UNLESS YOU'RE A LOW

00:28:21.299 --> 00:28:23.968
INCOME -- PARTICIPATE IN IT.

00:28:24.035 --> 00:28:26.371
OF ANY OF THE UTILITIES OKAY AND

00:28:26.438 --> 00:28:27.238
AND THEN TO THE QUESTION THAT

00:28:27.305 --> 00:28:32.277
PEOPLE ASK US ALL THE TIME --

00:28:32.343 --> 00:28:33.645
ARE WE REALLY HOLDING.

00:28:33.711 --> 00:28:36.014
P. JEANNIE TO ACCOUNT.

00:28:36.081 --> 00:28:36.948
FOR THE PROBLEMS THAT THEY

00:28:37.015 --> 00:28:39.317
CAUSED AND THE OBLIGATIONS THEY

00:28:39.384 --> 00:28:40.251
HAVE GOING BACKWARDS AND

00:28:40.318 --> 00:28:41.619
FORWARDS WHAT WOULD YOU SAYTO

00:28:41.686 --> 00:28:44.122
THEM I WOULD SAY A 100% I WOULD

00:28:44.189 --> 00:28:45.557
SAY THAT.

00:28:45.623 --> 00:28:47.058
WELL LIKE I SAID WHEN WE'VE BEEN

00:28:47.125 --> 00:28:48.960
TALKING TO THOSE WHO ARE GOING

00:28:49.027 --> 00:28:50.061
TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE FUND THE

00:28:50.128 --> 00:28:51.496
LARGEST FUND PORTION OF THE FUND

00:28:51.563 --> 00:28:52.864
WILL COME FROM A P. JEANNIE

00:28:52.931 --> 00:28:54.766
WOULD COME FROM P. GINNY BECAUSE

00:28:54.833 --> 00:28:55.366
THEY CARRY THE LARGEST MARKET

00:28:55.433 --> 00:28:58.736
SHARE -- I AM ALL TOO AWARE --

00:28:58.803 --> 00:28:59.904
LIKE I SAID AFTER BEING TO

00:28:59.971 --> 00:29:01.673
PARADISE AND TO BEING SOME OF

00:29:01.739 --> 00:29:02.907
THESE OTHER FIRES THAT YOU THAT

00:29:02.974 --> 00:29:04.843
P. JEANNIE HOLD RESPONSIBILITY

00:29:04.909 --> 00:29:06.244
AND ANY UTILITY.

00:29:06.311 --> 00:29:08.279
THAT IS RESPONSIBLE SHOULD HOLD

00:29:08.346 --> 00:29:10.115
THE RESPONSIBILITY HOWEVER WE

00:29:10.181 --> 00:29:11.549
HAVE CREATED A SYSTEM IN WHICH

00:29:11.616 --> 00:29:12.517
VICTIMS ARE HOLDING THE

00:29:12.584 --> 00:29:13.685
RESPONSIBILITY RIGHT NOW AND I

00:29:13.751 --> 00:29:14.886
DO NOT THINK THAT THAT SHOULD BE

00:29:14.953 --> 00:29:16.121
ACCEPTABLE TO US.

00:29:16.187 --> 00:29:18.022
WE CREATED THE SYSTEM NOT THE

00:29:18.089 --> 00:29:19.124
VICTIMS AND ME MAY NOT HAVE ALL

00:29:19.190 --> 00:29:20.325
BEEN HERE WHEN THE SYSTEM WAS

00:29:20.391 --> 00:29:21.893
CREATED BUT WE'RE HERE NOW AND

00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:25.463
THERE'S A PROBLEM.

00:29:25.530 --> 00:29:26.064
AND VICTIMS ARE SUFFERING FROM

00:29:26.131 --> 00:29:27.532
IT.

00:29:27.599 --> 00:29:29.000
AND WHILE P. JEANNIE ITSELF

00:29:29.067 --> 00:29:29.601
FILED FOR BANKRUPTCY AND ALL

00:29:29.667 --> 00:29:31.069
THEIR PROTECTING THEMSELVES WE

00:29:31.136 --> 00:29:32.370
HAVE TO PROTECT THE VICTIMS AND

00:29:32.437 --> 00:29:34.339
SO WE CAN HAVE THAT ARGUMENT AND

00:29:34.405 --> 00:29:36.274
ABSOLUTELY P. JEANNIE AT THE END

00:29:36.341 --> 00:29:37.542
OF THE DAY ANY I OWE YOU.

00:29:37.609 --> 00:29:39.010
THAT IS AT FAULT FOR A WHILE

00:29:39.077 --> 00:29:40.745
FIRE THAT BURNS DOWN VICTIMS

00:29:40.812 --> 00:29:42.313
HOMES OR BURNS DOWN A COMMUNITY

00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:43.681
SHOULD BE A 100% HELD

00:29:43.748 --> 00:29:45.416
RESPONSIBLE AND THIS THIS FUND

00:29:45.483 --> 00:29:46.951
DOES NOT CHANGE THAT.

00:29:47.018 --> 00:29:48.553
BUT WHAT THIS ONE DOES IS PUTS

00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:50.622
VICTIMS FIRST AND AS AS WERE

00:29:50.688 --> 00:29:53.324
REPRESENTATIVES OF THE

00:29:53.391 --> 00:29:54.993
OUR OBLIGATION NOT TO REQUIRE

00:29:55.059 --> 00:29:55.493
THAT.

00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:57.228
COMMUNITIES WAIT SEVEN TO NINE

00:29:57.295 --> 00:29:58.563
YEARS TO SEE THAT KIND OF

00:29:58.630 --> 00:30:00.331
RECOVERY BUT THAT THING GET

00:30:00.398 --> 00:30:01.900
THEIR HOMES REBUILT NOW.

00:30:01.966 --> 00:30:03.801
THAT WHEN ENTIRE COMMUNITIES ARE

00:30:03.868 --> 00:30:05.003
BURNT DOWN AND BECAUSE OF NO

00:30:05.069 --> 00:30:06.504
FAULT OF THEIR OWN THERE IS A

00:30:06.571 --> 00:30:07.772
PRICE SURGE AND THEY CAN NOT

00:30:07.839 --> 00:30:08.907
REBUILD THEIR HOMES THAT WE HAVE

00:30:08.973 --> 00:30:10.441
CREATED SOME SORT OF SAFETY NET

00:30:10.508 --> 00:30:11.342
FOR THEM.

00:30:11.409 --> 00:30:12.844
THIS IS OUR RESPOND THERE ARE

00:30:12.911 --> 00:30:14.412
PORTIONS OF THIS THAT ARE OUR

00:30:14.479 --> 00:30:15.446
RESPONSIBILITY YES THERE ARE I

00:30:15.513 --> 00:30:16.781
OWE YOU RESPONSIBILITIES

00:30:16.848 --> 00:30:18.650
ABSOLUTELY AND MAYBE ONE DAY

00:30:18.716 --> 00:30:20.185
APPEAL YOU RESPONSIBILITY.

00:30:20.251 --> 00:30:21.953
BUT WE HAVE RESPONSIBILITY TO

00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:23.154
OUR CONSTITUENTS TO MAKE SURE

00:30:23.221 --> 00:30:24.622
THAT THEY ARE TAKNG CARE OF

00:30:24.689 --> 00:30:26.591
FIRST AND FOREMOST AND THAT'S

00:30:26.658 --> 00:30:27.759
WHERE THIS BILL COMES FROM AND

00:30:27.825 --> 00:30:28.793
THAT'S THE ITENTION.

00:30:28.860 --> 00:30:30.628
SO THAT WOULD BE MY ANSWER TO

00:30:30.695 --> 00:30:32.363
THAT QUESTION IN JUST A FISH.

00:30:32.430 --> 00:30:34.432
THANK YOU FOR THE TIME.

00:30:34.499 --> 00:30:36.167
AND THAT'S WHAT MAKES ME.

00:30:36.234 --> 00:30:38.469
SO MOTIVATED TO KEEP YOUR BILL

00:30:38.536 --> 00:30:40.004
MOVING IS BECAUSE I THINK YOU'RE

00:30:40.071 --> 00:30:41.606
DOING IT IT OF WITH THE FOR THE

00:30:41.673 --> 00:30:42.707
RIGHT REASONS.

00:30:42.774 --> 00:30:43.841
AND WHILE I THINK THAT THERE ARE

00:30:43.908 --> 00:30:45.243
A LOT OF SIGNIFICANT ISSUES THAT

00:30:45.310 --> 00:30:46.644
ARE RAISED IN YOUR BILL.

00:30:46.711 --> 00:30:48.079
THAT REALLY HAVEN'T BEEN TALKED

00:30:48.146 --> 00:30:50.081
OUT OR THOUGHT OUT COMPLETELY --

00:30:50.148 --> 00:30:52.016
THAT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT

00:30:52.083 --> 00:30:52.750
FROM A PHILOSOPHICAL POINT OF

00:30:52.817 --> 00:30:55.620
VIEW. TO INDICATE HOW MUCH WE

00:30:55.687 --> 00:30:57.188

00:30:57.255 --> 00:30:57.755
THIS IS THE UNDER THE

00:30:57.822 --> 00:30:59.324
JURISDICTION OF THIS COMMITTEE

00:30:59.390 --> 00:31:01.826
IS INSURANCE AND WHETHER OR NOT

00:31:01.893 --> 00:31:02.427
THERE'S ADEQUATE INSURANCE AND

00:31:02.493 --> 00:31:08.233
WE'VE HAD HEARINGS ON THIS TO

00:31:08.299 --> 00:31:09.701
TRY TO UNDERSTAND.

00:31:09.767 --> 00:31:10.635

00:31:13.338 --> 00:31:13.838
THESE WILD FIRES AT A LOT OF

00:31:13.905 --> 00:31:15.106

THE FAIR.

00:31:17.008 --> 00:31:18.176
PLAN AND WHETHER THAT'S REALLY

00:31:18.243 --> 00:31:19.377
BEING TAPPED TO DO IN A

00:31:19.444 --> 00:31:20.378
SIGNIFICANT WAY TO KNOW WHETHER

01:03:22.798 --> 01:03:23.866
CONVERSATION THAN A I SEE.

01:03:23.933 --> 01:03:26.802
IT ALSO ENCOURAGES THAT THE

01:03:26.869 --> 01:03:27.370
INSURANCE DEPARTMENT SHOULD

01:03:27.436 --> 01:03:29.705
SUPPORT.

01:03:29.772 --> 01:03:32.108
THE CHAIRS LIKE WATER TO MEMBER

01:03:32.175 --> 01:03:33.576
CYNOSURE SCREENING EACH HOUSE

01:03:33.643 --> 01:03:34.877
BUDGET COMMITTEE REPRESENT. TO

01:03:34.944 --> 01:03:36.045

01:03:36.112 --> 01:03:37.580
BACK AND WATCH WHAT HAPPENS TO

01:03:37.647 --> 01:03:38.614
THE ICY.

01:03:38.681 --> 01:03:39.949
AND A COMPANION ORGANIZATION THE

01:03:40.016 --> 01:03:42.885
NATIONAL COUNCIL OF INSURANCE

01:03:42.952 --> 01:03:44.053
LEGISLATORS.

01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:44.654
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO

01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:46.222
IS NATIONAL COUNCIL INSURANCE

01:03:46.289 --> 01:03:47.623
LEGISLATORS ARE STRICTLY

01:03:47.690 --> 01:03:48.758
LAWMAKERS.

01:03:48.824 --> 01:03:50.660
THE CONVENE PERIODICALLY TALK

01:03:50.726 --> 01:03:51.928
ABOUT WHAT'S HOT.

01:03:51.994 --> 01:03:52.929
ON INSURANCE FRONT THE

01:03:52.995 --> 01:03:54.297
LEGISLATURE MAY WISH TO KNOW

01:03:54.363 --> 01:03:56.098
ABOUT.

01:03:56.165 --> 01:03:57.200
ARE THE DIVERSITY GOING TO THOSE

01:03:57.266 --> 01:03:58.367
TO ME IS IF YOU GO TO THE ANY I

01:03:58.434 --> 01:03:59.835

WALK OUT OF THE FOREST.

01:04:04.740 --> 01:04:06.542
IT'S VERY CONFUSING TO SPEND A

01:04:06.609 --> 01:04:08.344
FEW DAYS IT MAY I SEE ALL THE

01:04:08.411 --> 01:04:09.946
TOPICS UNDER CONSIDERATION TO

01:04:10.012 --> 01:04:11.514
GET UP TO SPEED WALKING OFF THE

01:04:11.581 --> 01:04:12.014
STREET AS OLD.

01:04:12.081 --> 01:04:14.650
AS A MEMBER THE PUBLIC IS VERY

01:04:14.717 --> 01:04:16.052
HARD IT'S KIND OF CHAOTIC.

01:04:16.118 --> 01:04:18.921
IN COIL IS MORE OF A FOCUS CITY

01:04:18.988 --> 01:04:20.122
WHERE YOU'D BE YOU'D BE SEEN

01:04:20.189 --> 01:04:22.058
WITH OTHER LAWMAKERS THERE'S AN

01:04:22.124 --> 01:04:22.959
AGENDA THEIR SPREE FEEDS.

01:04:23.025 --> 01:04:24.760
REALLY DESIGNED EIGHT EIGHT THE

01:04:24.827 --> 01:04:26.262
QUICK LAWMAKERS SO I VIEW THIS

01:04:26.329 --> 01:04:28.864
BILL IS ISN'T KNOWLEDGE MEN OF

01:04:28.931 --> 01:04:30.233
THIS DELEGATION ISSUE.

01:04:30.299 --> 01:04:31.734
THE IMPORTANCE OF LAWMAKERS

01:04:31.801 --> 01:04:33.603
BEING INFORMED ON PUBLIC POLICY

01:04:33.669 --> 01:04:35.171
THE C. GET MATTER THAT THE

01:04:35.238 --> 01:04:36.205
GUARANTEE FUND YOU JUST TALK

01:04:36.272 --> 01:04:37.673
ABOUT THAT'S ACTUALLY ONE OF THE

01:04:37.740 --> 01:04:40.509
ACCREDITED STANDARD STATUTES IN

01:04:40.576 --> 01:04:41.244
CALIFORNIA.

01:04:41.310 --> 01:04:42.678
A IT'S JUST DESIGNED TO ENSURE

01:04:42.745 --> 01:04:45.047
THAT LAWMAKERS WHO ARE THE

01:04:45.114 --> 01:04:46.616
SOURCE OF THIS DELEGATED POWER

01:04:46.682 --> 01:04:47.883
ACTUALLY SORT OF HAVE A HANDLE

01:04:47.950 --> 01:04:49.919
ON WHAT'S ONE OF THE HOT ISSUES

01:04:49.986 --> 01:04:51.354
WHAT'S CURRENT.

01:04:51.420 --> 01:04:54.056
AND TRADITIONALLY AND I WOULD

01:04:54.123 --> 01:04:54.924
EXPECT THAT WILL CONTINUE

01:04:54.991 --> 01:04:56.592
CALIFORNIA ACTUALLY PAYS THE

01:04:56.659 --> 01:04:58.327
LEGISLATURE PAYS OUR MEMBERSHIP

01:04:58.394 --> 01:04:59.762
IN NATIONAL COUNCIL INSURANCE

01:04:59.829 --> 01:05:05.468
LEGISLATORS I WOULD NOT EXPECT

01:05:05.534 --> 01:05:06.469
THAT TO CHANGE.

01:05:06.535 --> 01:05:07.737
BUT IT DOES ASK THE DEPARTMENT

01:05:07.803 --> 01:05:08.704
SURE IS TO KIND OF COORDINATE

01:05:08.771 --> 01:05:09.338
WITH HELPING GET SOME LAWMAKERS

SENSE -- I THINK IT'S A BONUS

01:06:33.889 --> 01:06:34.657

WITH AN ELECTED INSURANCE

01:07:00.883 --> 01:07:02.485
COMMISSIONER IS THAT CORRECT ALL

01:07:07.089 --> 01:07:08.524
POSITION UNTIL PROP ONE OF THREE

01:07:08.591 --> 01:07:11.127

01:07:27.343 --> 01:07:28.944
INSURANCE COMMISSIONER DECIDES

01:07:29.011 --> 01:07:29.879
HE'S NOT GOING TO COMPLY WITH

01:07:29.945 --> 01:07:31.714
THIS WHAT'S THE ENFORCEMENT.

01:07:31.781 --> 01:07:35.618
PROCESS.

01:07:35.684 --> 01:07:37.520
THE RESPONSES ON THAT I THINK TO

01:07:37.586 --> 01:07:39.054
CHANGE THE DATE FOR THE INTEREST

01:07:39.121 --> 01:07:40.623
CHRIS OF POSITION WOULD YOU DO

01:07:40.689 --> 01:07:41.690
TO VOTE OF THE PEOPLE.

01:07:41.757 --> 01:07:43.626
THAT'S WHY PROP ON ALL THREE

01:07:43.692 --> 01:07:45.327
WERE STRUCTURED.

01:07:45.394 --> 01:07:46.362
YEAH I'M JUST I'M NOT ADVOCATING

01:07:46.429 --> 01:07:48.230
FOR ELIMINATING ELECTED

01:07:48.297 --> 01:07:49.465
INSURANCE COMMISSIONER OF RIGHT

01:07:49.532 --> 01:07:52.134
I WAS JUST STATING THAT AS A

01:07:52.201 --> 01:07:54.103
YEAH THAT'S SO THAT'S THAT'S A

01:07:54.170 --> 01:07:57.173
GIVEN -- LET'S SEE NOW THE FIRST

01:07:57.239 --> 01:07:58.841
QUESTION THEN AFTER THAT YOU

01:07:58.908 --> 01:08:01.410
MENTIONED.

01:08:01.477 --> 01:08:06.315
YEAH I DELEGATED POWERS -- YEAH

01:08:06.382 --> 01:08:11.787
I THINK -- AS A PRACTICAL MATTER

01:08:11.854 --> 01:08:13.389
ANY AS HE DOES PER PROMULGATE

01:08:13.456 --> 01:08:15.558
THESE MODELS AND THEY OFTEN COME

01:08:15.624 --> 01:08:17.226
BEFORE US.

01:08:17.293 --> 01:08:18.394
I WILL SAY IN MY CAREER WHEN

01:08:18.461 --> 01:08:20.095
I'VE SERVED AS A CONSULTANT TO

01:08:20.162 --> 01:08:22.765
THIS COMMITTEE -- AND IN THE

01:08:22.832 --> 01:08:24.733
ASSEMBLY AND NINETEEN EIGHTIES

01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:25.267
FOR ITS ASSEMBLY INSURANCE

01:08:25.334 --> 01:08:26.302
COMMITTEE.

01:08:26.368 --> 01:08:27.903
IT WAS ALWAYS MY RECOMMENDATION

01:08:27.970 --> 01:08:29.238
IT WHAT IT WHAT THE AN ICY CAME

01:08:29.305 --> 01:08:31.907
FORWARD WITH WAS A MODEL LAW OR

01:08:31.974 --> 01:08:33.409
MODEL REGULATION.

01:08:33.476 --> 01:08:34.944
THE HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE ARE

01:08:35.010 --> 01:08:36.278
JUST TREAT THEM AS SOME TO WE

01:08:36.345 --> 01:08:37.413
WOULD ADOPT BY STATUTE.

01:08:37.480 --> 01:08:39.114
WE WOULD BE IN CONTROL OF THOSE

01:08:39.181 --> 01:08:41.116
CONVERSATIONS NOT THAT THINGS

01:08:41.183 --> 01:08:43.185
GET PROPOSES REGULATIONS GOING

01:08:43.252 --> 01:08:44.887
TO DOCTORS REGULATIONS WE'VE

01:08:44.954 --> 01:08:45.754
NEVER SEEN.

01:08:45.821 --> 01:08:47.723
SO I DO THINK AN ACTIVE INTEREST

01:08:47.790 --> 01:08:49.892
BY POLICY MAKERS IN THE

01:08:49.959 --> 01:08:50.993
INSURANCE COMMITTEES CAN CAN

01:08:51.060 --> 01:08:53.462
KIND OF CONTROL THIS THIS IS

01:08:53.529 --> 01:08:55.564
PART OF WHAT THIS BILL IS

01:08:55.631 --> 01:08:57.066
DESIGNED TO SUPPORT.

01:08:57.132 --> 01:08:57.666
ON THIS OTHER ISSUE VIS A VIS

01:08:57.733 --> 01:08:58.767
DID NOT COMPLY I THINK THAT'S

01:08:58.834 --> 01:09:00.469
WHY WE PASSED A STATUTE

01:09:00.536 --> 01:09:00.769
[inaudible]

01:09:00.836 --> 01:09:05.941
THE THE OR SOURCE OF THIS BILL.

01:09:06.008 --> 01:09:07.409
NOT UNDER OUR CURRENT INSURANCE

01:09:07.476 --> 01:09:10.446
COMMISSIONER BUT IN TIMES PAST.

01:09:10.513 --> 01:09:11.881
I HAD REACHED OUT TO THE ANY I

01:09:11.947 --> 01:09:13.415
SEE.

01:09:13.482 --> 01:09:15.017
REQUESTED THEY MIGHT COME TO

01:09:15.084 --> 01:09:16.051
SACRAMENTO.

01:09:16.118 --> 01:09:17.853
AND PROVIDE A BRIEFING ON WHAT

01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:19.989
THEY WOULD DO WHAT THEY DO.

01:09:20.055 --> 01:09:22.057
BECAUSE RESIST DELEGATED POWER.

01:09:22.124 --> 01:09:25.761
AND IN THOSE DAYS THEY SAID WELL

01:09:25.828 --> 01:09:27.496
WE'LL GET BACK TO YOU.

01:09:27.563 --> 01:09:29.498
AND WHAT ENSUED WAS A REACHED

01:09:29.565 --> 01:09:31.233
OUT TO THE THE DENTURES

01:09:31.300 --> 01:09:32.568
TREASURER OF THE TIME.

01:09:32.635 --> 01:09:34.770
CALIFORNIA WHO SAYS NO I DON'T

01:09:34.837 --> 01:09:37.306
WANT TO COME TO CALIFORNIA AND

01:09:37.373 --> 01:09:38.574
THAT INITIATIVE ONE AWAY.

01:09:38.641 --> 01:09:40.142
SO THIS IS ACTUALLY A WAY TO

01:09:40.209 --> 01:09:41.410
KIND OF DO SOME STATUE TO SET US

01:09:41.477 --> 01:09:42.978
MAKE SURE.

01:10:02.898 --> 01:10:03.866
GOVERNMENT.

01:10:03.933 --> 01:10:05.367
IT IS A STATE BASED REGULATION

01:10:05.434 --> 01:10:07.570
BUT BECAUSE OF PRIVACY ISSUES OF

01:10:07.636 --> 01:10:09.705
FINANCIAL CRISES THE FEDS HAVE

01:10:09.772 --> 01:10:10.739
MORE OF A ROLE.

01:10:10.806 --> 01:10:12.374
IT'S A WAY TO KIND OF SPEND A

01:10:12.441 --> 01:10:14.109

IF WE HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THIS --

01:10:40.970 --> 01:10:42.438
THAT MIGHT BE THE TOOL THAT WE

01:10:42.504 --> 01:10:43.939
THERE YOU GO BECAUSE THE STATUTE

01:10:44.006 --> 01:10:47.076

WE'VE BEEN PROVIDED INDICATES.

01:10:57.353 --> 01:10:58.554
INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

01:10:58.621 --> 01:11:00.289
ALLOWS NON CONTROVERSIAL

01:11:00.356 --> 01:11:02.491
TECHNICAL AND PROCEDURAL CHANGES

01:11:02.558 --> 01:11:04.259
TO BECOME LAW WITHOUT DEBATE OR

01:11:04.326 --> 01:11:05.027
SCRUTINY.

01:11:05.094 --> 01:11:06.228
ASSUME THAT'S THE DELEGATION

01:11:06.295 --> 01:11:07.830
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SIR YEAH

01:11:07.896 --> 01:11:09.264
THAT WOULD BE -- THAT IS

01:11:09.331 --> 01:11:12.067
CERTAINLY -- AN ASPECT OF IT I

01:11:12.134 --> 01:11:13.569
MEAN I WOULD SAY.

01:11:13.636 --> 01:11:15.137
THE MAN DOES IT EXTEND BEYOND

01:11:15.204 --> 01:11:18.273
THAT.

01:11:18.340 --> 01:11:20.542
WELL I'LL SAY THIS THE ANY MORE

01:11:20.609 --> 01:11:22.511
ANY OF THESE MODELS THERE

01:11:22.578 --> 01:11:23.445
EIGHTEEN MODEL STATUTES ARE

01:11:23.512 --> 01:11:26.148
GENERALLY A PRODUCT OF PROBABLY

01:11:26.215 --> 01:11:28.651
TWO OR THREE YEARS OF OF DEBATES

01:11:28.717 --> 01:11:29.818
AND DISCUSSIONS INSIDE THE ANY I

01:11:29.885 --> 01:11:31.587
SEE.

01:11:31.654 --> 01:11:33.222
AND SO WE NEVER KIND OF

01:11:33.288 --> 01:11:34.757
TYPICALLY ARE PARTICIPATING HAVE

01:11:34.823 --> 01:11:36.959
ARE HERE THE GROUND HERE IN ONE

01:11:37.026 --> 01:11:38.627
OF THE TRADE OFFS BEING MADE.

01:11:38.694 --> 01:11:41.497
THEY END UP WITH A DOCUMENT

01:11:41.563 --> 01:11:42.998
WHICH IS OUR MODEL STATUTE THEY

01:11:43.065 --> 01:11:44.800
BRING TO US AND ASK US

01:11:44.867 --> 01:11:46.935
INTRODUCED. THREE YOU KNOW WORDS

01:11:47.002 --> 01:11:48.170
DO MATTER AND THERE CAN BE

01:11:48.237 --> 01:11:49.505
SUBTLETIES OF WORDING THAT

01:11:49.571 --> 01:11:51.006
REPRESENTS SOME TRADE OFF THAT

01:11:51.073 --> 01:11:52.307
HAPPENED IN A I SEE.

01:11:52.374 --> 01:11:53.275
WHICH ACTUALLY MAYBE SOME

01:11:53.342 --> 01:11:56.645
SERVICE IMPACT WE MAY NOT SEE IT --

01:11:56.712 --> 01:11:59.415
MUST BE UP THERE MUST BE A A

01:11:59.481 --> 01:12:01.383
PROTOCOL THAT WE'VE SIGNED.

01:12:01.450 --> 01:12:03.652
WELL I THINK WE I MEAN I WOULD

01:12:03.719 --> 01:12:05.354
SAY IN OUR INSURANCE CODE FOR

01:12:05.421 --> 01:12:06.789
EXAMPLE THE MARKER CONDUCT AREA

01:12:06.855 --> 01:12:09.158
WE JUST HAVE A PROVISIONS SAYS.

01:12:09.224 --> 01:12:11.360
THE MARKET CONDUCT GUIDE OF THE

01:12:11.427 --> 01:12:14.329
ANY I SEE AS A CURRENT EXIST OR

01:12:14.396 --> 01:12:15.597
FUTURE EDITIONS.

01:12:15.664 --> 01:12:17.032
OUR OUR THE ONE THAT OUR

01:12:17.099 --> 01:12:17.933
DEPARTMENT [inaudible]

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:19.735
RUNS WITH.

01:12:19.802 --> 01:12:21.036
SO THAT'S THAT COULD BE MORE

01:12:21.103 --> 01:12:23.505
THAN JUST TECHNICAL CHANGES WELL

01:12:23.572 --> 01:12:24.506
I MEAN LET ME AS COULD TO THE

01:12:24.573 --> 01:12:26.241
DIFFERENT WAYS SO WITH REGARD TO

01:12:26.308 --> 01:12:27.843
THE IN A I SEE SO.

01:12:27.910 --> 01:12:29.945
THE IN A I SEE COULD ADOPT A

01:12:30.012 --> 01:12:31.780
MODEL CODE HAVING TO DO WITH

01:12:31.847 --> 01:12:33.382
UNINSURED UNDERINSURED.

01:12:33.449 --> 01:12:34.683
AND IT WOULD AUTOMATICALLY BE

01:12:34.750 --> 01:12:36.418
INCORPORATED INTO OUR WELL IT WE

01:12:36.485 --> 01:12:38.654
WOULD HAVE TO ADOPTED WE WE HAVE

01:12:38.721 --> 01:12:40.289
TO ACT UPON THEIR MODELS.

01:12:40.355 --> 01:12:41.690
BUT THEY COULD ADOPT A MODEL

01:12:41.757 --> 01:12:43.492
WHICH WE MIGHT CONSIDER

01:12:43.559 --> 01:12:44.660
CONTROVERSIAL.

01:12:44.727 --> 01:12:46.095
AND THEY CAN INCORPORATED IN

01:12:46.161 --> 01:12:48.430
THEIR ACCREDITATION SYSTEM.

01:12:48.497 --> 01:12:49.231
AND THEN WE SORT OF HAVE A

01:12:49.298 --> 01:12:50.866
LITTLE BIT OF A WE WE NEED TO

01:12:50.933 --> 01:12:51.967
KIND OF BACK UP OUR INTEREST

01:12:52.034 --> 01:12:53.969
FORMER SAY WELL.

01:12:54.036 --> 01:12:55.404
THAT'S YOUR MODEL IS TWENTY YEAR.

01:12:55.471 --> 01:12:57.372
THINGS THAT YOU MEASURE WHETHER

01:12:57.439 --> 01:12:59.541
AN INSURANCE FARMERS ACCREDITED

01:12:59.608 --> 01:13:01.143
BUT WE ACTUALLY AS POLICY MAKERS

01:13:01.210 --> 01:13:02.177
IN CALIFORNIA OF A DIFFERENT

01:13:02.244 --> 01:13:03.579
VIEW SO APPARENTLY THEY'RE TWO

01:13:03.645 --> 01:13:05.948
DIFFERENT CATEGORIES SO IF IT IS.

01:13:06.014 --> 01:13:07.049
IF THE SUBJECT IS NON

01:13:07.116 --> 01:13:08.617
CONTROVERSIAL TECHNICAL OR

01:13:08.684 --> 01:13:10.519
PROCEDURAL IT CAN SIMPLY SLIDE

01:13:10.586 --> 01:13:11.987
RIGHT INTO OUR INSURANCE CODE

01:13:12.054 --> 01:13:13.789
WITHOUT COMING HERE.

01:13:13.856 --> 01:13:14.256
BUT IF IT'S SOMETHING

01:13:14.323 --> 01:13:16.325
SIGNIFICANT IT HAS TO COME HERE

01:13:16.391 --> 01:13:17.326
AND WE HAVE TO DEBATE AND VOTE

01:13:17.392 --> 01:13:20.395
ON IT I WOULD SAY I MEAN I'M

01:13:20.462 --> 01:13:23.398
GONNA SAY. THIRTY ASKED YOU HAVE.

01:13:23.465 --> 01:13:26.935
THEY CAN'T PASS A MODEL.

01:13:27.002 --> 01:13:28.237
SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY PASSED A

01:13:28.303 --> 01:13:29.838
MODEL IT'LL HAVE NO AFFECT US IN

01:13:29.905 --> 01:13:31.006
CALIFORNIA.

01:13:31.073 --> 01:13:32.508
THE ONLY WILL BECOME EFFECTIVE

01:13:32.574 --> 01:13:34.343
IN CALIFORNIA IS IF BECAUSE

01:13:34.409 --> 01:13:36.979
INTRODUCES A BILL.

01:13:37.045 --> 01:13:38.947
AND GOES TO OUR PROCESS.

01:13:39.014 --> 01:13:39.681
YOU KNOW THIS THE STANDARD IS

01:13:39.748 --> 01:13:41.450
REAR ENACT NO LOCKS UP BY A

01:13:41.517 --> 01:13:43.252
STATUTE NEW STATUTES UP BY BILL

01:13:43.318 --> 01:13:44.653
THAT STILL APPLIES.

01:13:44.720 --> 01:13:46.088
IF THEY GO THE REGULATORY ROUTE

01:13:46.155 --> 01:13:47.723
THEY FEEL THEY HAVE SOME

01:13:47.790 --> 01:13:49.057
AUTHORITY OR IN THE STATUTE.

01:13:49.124 --> 01:13:50.559
THEN MAYBE THERE ARE MODEL

01:13:50.626 --> 01:13:52.194
REGULATION GETS.

01:13:52.261 --> 01:13:53.562
PROMULGATED BY INSTRUCTORS AS A

01:13:53.629 --> 01:13:56.932
MODEL REGULATION STILL HAS TO GO

01:13:56.999 --> 01:13:59.268
THROUGH THAT PROCESS -- I AM

01:13:59.334 --> 01:14:01.003
JUST A PROPONENT FOR LAWMAKERS

01:14:01.069 --> 01:14:03.105
TO KIND OF UNDERSTAND.

01:14:03.172 --> 01:14:04.640
WHAT IS REPRESENTED THESE MODELS

01:14:04.706 --> 01:14:06.074
WHEN THEY COME FORWARD?

01:14:06.141 --> 01:14:07.910
AND MAYBE SOME OF THE BACKSTORY

01:14:07.976 --> 01:14:10.078
CONVERSATION.

01:14:10.145 --> 01:14:11.547
SO THAT WE HAVE A MORE INFORMED.

01:14:11.613 --> 01:14:19.087
VIEW OF WHAT WE ARE ADOPTING.

01:14:19.154 --> 01:14:21.190
WHAT IT IS?

01:14:21.256 --> 01:14:22.090
ALSO.

01:14:22.157 --> 01:14:23.091
IT'S AN INTERESTING CONVERSATION

01:14:23.158 --> 01:14:23.826
BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE VOTING

01:14:23.892 --> 01:14:24.459
ON YEAH I MEAN I DO THINK THAT

01:14:24.526 --> 01:14:25.661
WE DO HAVE PROVISIONS ON THE

01:14:25.727 --> 01:14:26.962
