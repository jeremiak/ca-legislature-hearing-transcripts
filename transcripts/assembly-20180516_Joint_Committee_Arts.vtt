00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:44.264 region:rollup2
SOCIAL SCIENCES AND THE ARTS.

00:12:42.795 --> 00:12:46.199 region:rollup2
WE ARE THE LETTERS IN COLLEGES

00:12:44.264 --> 00:12:47.400 region:rollup2
OF LETTERS ARTS AND SCIENCES WE

00:12:46.199 --> 00:12:48.701 region:rollup2
ARE THE BOOK PEOPLE.

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:49.802 region:rollup2
WE READ THEM AND WE WRITE THEM

00:12:48.701 --> 00:12:52.005 region:rollup2
AND WE MAKE OUR STUDENTS READ

00:12:49.802 --> 00:12:53.606 region:rollup2
THEM AND THINK ABOUT THEM.

00:12:52.005 --> 00:12:55.541 region:rollup2
THAT'S ONE WAY TO DEFINE THE

00:12:53.606 --> 00:12:57.310 region:rollup2
HUMANITIES AND IT'S USEFUL.

00:12:55.541 --> 00:12:58.411 region:rollup2
A SET OF FIELDS EXPLORING IDEAS

00:12:57.310 --> 00:13:00.146 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE HUMAN CONDITION AND

00:12:58.411 --> 00:13:01.814 region:rollup2
ABOUT HUMANITY.

00:13:00.146 --> 00:13:03.850 region:rollup2
ON OUR BEST DAYS WE THINK OF OUR

00:13:01.814 --> 00:13:05.418 region:rollup2
WORK AS A CALLING. AND WE REVEL

00:13:03.850 --> 00:13:06.286 region:rollup2
IN THE CIVIL EXCHANGE OF IDEAS

00:13:05.418 --> 00:13:07.620 region:rollup2
ABOUT JUST WHAT IT MEANS TO BE

00:13:06.286 --> 00:13:08.821 region:rollup2
HUMAN.

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:09.956 region:rollup2
WE ACKNOWLEDGE AND DRAW

00:13:08.821 --> 00:13:11.591 region:rollup2
SUSTENANCE FROM THAT ROOT OF THE

00:13:09.956 --> 00:13:13.826 region:rollup2
WORD ITSELF.

00:13:11.591 --> 00:13:15.294 region:rollup2
THE HUMAN IN THE HUMANITIES.

00:13:13.826 --> 00:13:16.596 region:rollup2
BUT ALLOW ME TO BRING ACADEMIC

00:13:15.294 --> 00:13:18.398 region:rollup2
AND POINTY HEADED DISTINCTIONS

00:13:16.596 --> 00:13:20.633 region:rollup2
TO THE GROUND AND A REAL

00:13:18.398 --> 00:13:22.201 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE HERE IN CALIFORNIA.

00:13:20.633 --> 00:13:24.137 region:rollup2
THE HUMANITIES ARE BRIDGE THE

00:13:22.201 --> 00:13:25.538 region:rollup2
MOST EFFECTIVE BRIDGE BETWEEN

00:13:24.137 --> 00:13:27.206 region:rollup2
SCHOLARSHIP AND THE PUBLIC WHICH

00:13:25.538 --> 00:13:28.641 region:rollup2
ALL OF US SERVE.

00:13:27.206 --> 00:13:29.776 region:rollup2
THE HUMANITIES OBLIGATE US TO

00:13:28.641 --> 00:13:31.678 region:rollup2
SPEAK TO BIG AUDIENCES AND BIG

00:13:29.776 --> 00:13:32.712 region:rollup2
PUBLIC'S.

00:13:31.678 --> 00:13:33.813 region:rollup2
OF COURSE THERE'S ROOM FOR

00:13:32.712 --> 00:13:35.615 region:rollup2
ARCANE ACADEMIC ARGUMENT AND

00:13:33.813 --> 00:13:37.183 region:rollup2
LANGUAGE.

00:13:35.615 --> 00:13:38.651 region:rollup2
THERE IS TECHNICAL PROVISIONS IN

00:13:37.183 --> 00:13:40.453 region:rollup2
THE POSITION IN THE HUMANITIES

00:13:38.651 --> 00:13:43.122 region:rollup2
ARGUMENTS STEEPED IN ARCHAIC

00:13:40.453 --> 00:13:44.757 region:rollup2
TEXTS LANGUAGES EXPERIENCES.

00:13:43.122 --> 00:13:46.592 region:rollup2
BUT AT HEART DOING HUMANITIES AS

00:13:44.757 --> 00:13:47.760 region:rollup2
AN ACT OF TRANSLATION.

00:13:46.592 --> 00:13:49.929 region:rollup2
FOSTERING THE TRANSMISSION OF

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:51.931 region:rollup2
IDEAS AND INSIGHTS FROM THE

00:13:49.929 --> 00:13:53.099 region:rollup2
ACADEMY TO BROADER PUBLIC'S.

00:13:51.931 --> 00:13:54.734 region:rollup2
BUT THIS IS A BRIDGE OPEN THE

00:13:53.099 --> 00:13:56.235 region:rollup2
TWO WAY TRAFFIC.

00:13:54.734 --> 00:13:58.237 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OUR MEDIUM IS USUALLY

00:13:56.235 --> 00:14:00.440 region:rollup2
WORDS SPOKEN WRITTEN SONG OR

00:13:58.237 --> 00:14:02.008 region:rollup2
OTHERWISE. WE CAN AND DO BRING

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:04.210 region:rollup2
THE PUBLIC'S WORDED LIVES AND

00:14:02.008 --> 00:14:05.912 region:rollup2
CONCERNS IN ACADEMIC SETTINGS.

00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:07.180 region:rollup2
SO AS TO MAKE THE PUBLIC'S YOUR

00:14:05.912 --> 00:14:09.248 region:rollup2
EARNINGS LEGITIMIZED FOR

00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:11.451 region:rollup2
ACADEMIC RESEARCH.

00:14:09.248 --> 00:14:13.186 region:rollup2
SO AS TO MAKE THE PUBLIC HEARD.

00:14:11.451 --> 00:14:15.822 region:rollup2
THE HUMANITIES COMMUNICATE.

00:14:13.186 --> 00:14:17.023 region:rollup2
ME TO MY CLASSROOM YES BUT SO

00:14:15.822 --> 00:14:19.158 region:rollup2

00:14:17.023 --> 00:14:20.693 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIANS TO THAT CLASSROOM.

00:14:19.158 --> 00:14:22.028 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIANS YOUNG AND OLD

00:14:20.693 --> 00:14:23.062 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIANS FROM EVERY WALK OF

00:14:22.028 --> 00:14:24.897 region:rollup2
LIFE AND EVERY CORNER OF THE

00:14:23.062 --> 00:14:26.833 region:rollup2
STATE.

00:14:24.897 --> 00:14:27.834 region:rollup2
WE ARE CALIFORNIANS ALL.

00:14:26.833 --> 00:14:29.669 region:rollup2
THINK OF WHAT WE ASK THE

00:14:27.834 --> 00:14:31.037 region:rollup2
HUMANITIES TO TEACH US.

00:14:29.669 --> 00:14:32.538 region:rollup2
THINK OF THE BONDS OF COMMUNITY

00:14:31.037 --> 00:14:33.873 region:rollup2
AND PURPOSE WE ASK THE

00:14:32.538 --> 00:14:35.842 region:rollup2
HUMANITIES TO FORGE.

00:14:33.873 --> 00:14:37.210 region:rollup2
THINK BACK.

00:14:35.842 --> 00:14:39.579 region:rollup2
THE HUMANITIES TELL US WHERE WE

00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:41.547 region:rollup2
WHO WE ARE. MYSTERIOUS PUZZLING

00:14:39.579 --> 00:14:43.683 region:rollup2
OPEN TO DEBATE WHO CAME FIRST TO

00:14:41.547 --> 00:14:45.752 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA WHO POPULATED THIS

00:14:43.683 --> 00:14:47.487 region:rollup2
PLACE AND WHEN.

00:14:45.752 --> 00:14:49.322 region:rollup2
THE HUMANITIES PACKAGE DATA.

ANTHROPOLOGY. AND HELP TELL

00:14:52.592 --> 00:14:56.763 region:rollup2
HUMAN STORY OF MIGRATION FROM

00:14:54.327 --> 00:14:58.398 region:rollup2
FAR TO THE NORTH. FROM THE STEPS

00:14:56.763 --> 00:15:00.733 region:rollup2
FROM ASIA OR MAYBE FROM

00:14:58.398 --> 00:15:02.335 region:rollup2
POLYNESIA BY OUTRIGGER CANOES

00:15:00.733 --> 00:15:04.871 region:rollup2
ALL THOUSANDS OF YEARS AGO

00:15:02.335 --> 00:15:07.106 region:rollup2
LIKELY MORE. THE HUMANITIES POSE

00:15:04.871 --> 00:15:08.374 region:rollup2
ORIGIN STORIES FOR CALIFORNIA

00:15:07.106 --> 00:15:09.942 region:rollup2
JUST THAT THEY INTERPRET AND

00:15:08.374 --> 00:15:10.943 region:rollup2
ANALYZE THEM.

00:15:09.942 --> 00:15:12.678 region:rollup2
THE HUMANITIES IN THIS WAY

00:15:10.943 --> 00:15:14.580 region:rollup2
REMIND US OF OUR PATRIMONY OF

00:15:12.678 --> 00:15:16.482 region:rollup2
ANCIENT DIVERSITY. PRE DATING

00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:18.317 region:rollup2
ANY MODERN JUST ASSUMPTIONS OF

00:15:16.482 --> 00:15:19.819 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCE IN MULTI CULTURALISM.

00:15:18.317 --> 00:15:21.320 region:rollup2
THEY MAKE OF CHAIN A CHAIN OF

00:15:19.819 --> 00:15:23.456 region:rollup2
HUMANITY THAT STOPS FOR THE

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:24.924 region:rollup2
MOMENT WITH US.

00:15:23.456 --> 00:15:26.459 region:rollup2
THE AMENITIES CAUTION US AND

00:15:24.924 --> 00:15:27.693 region:rollup2
THEN NOBLE US.

00:15:26.459 --> 00:15:29.529 region:rollup2
OF COURSE WE FIND PAIN AND

00:15:27.693 --> 00:15:31.063 region:rollup2
HEARTACHE IN THE PAST.

00:15:29.529 --> 00:15:32.031 region:rollup2
THE HUMANITIES TEACHERS FOR

00:15:31.063 --> 00:15:33.933 region:rollup2

00:15:37.236 --> 00:15:41.441 region:rollup2

THEY DID SPLASH

00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:51.150 region:rollup2
BUT THEY KILLED TWO.

00:15:49.782 --> 00:15:53.019 region:rollup2
THE HUMANITIES DOESN'T EXPECT

00:15:51.150 --> 00:15:54.220 region:rollup2
THEM TO BE WITHOUT SIN. NOR DOES

00:15:53.019 --> 00:15:56.155 region:rollup2

CHINATOWN.

00:28:50.195 --> 00:28:53.131 region:rollup2
I WANTED TO PULL FOCUS ON THE

00:28:51.863 --> 00:28:55.901 region:rollup2
ENCROACHING CHANGE TO THIS

00:28:53.131 --> 00:28:56.201 region:rollup2
HISTORIC NEIGHBORHOOD. BUT ALSO

I WANTED TO.

00:28:56.201 --> 00:29:00.672 region:rollup2
.

00:28:58.103 --> 00:29:02.140 region:rollup2
FOCUS ON A FEW OF THE CHINATOWN

00:29:00.672 --> 00:29:03.809 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY MEMBERS BECAUSE HE IS

00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:06.778 region:rollup2
ONLY ONE.

00:29:03.809 --> 00:29:09.047 region:rollup2
STORY AND SO IN THE END OF THE

00:29:06.778 --> 00:29:09.748 region:rollup2
FILM WE WE GET TO MEET DOROTHY

00:29:09.047 --> 00:29:11.550 region:rollup2

IN CHINATOWN. AND THE MAIN

00:29:26.698 --> 00:29:30.002 region:rollup2
REASON FOR PULLING FOCUS ON ALL

FOR ME UNTIL I SAW THE VIDEO.

00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:06.664 region:rollup2

IS HOW WE ENVISION OUR FUTURE TO

BE BUT IF WE HAD THE RESOURCES

00:37:06.491 --> 00:37:10.495 region:rollup2
TO DO THAT. ALL THE TIME THEN IT

00:37:08.827 --> 00:37:12.230 region:rollup2
WOULD TAKE JUST ONE DOCUMENTARY

00:37:10.495 --> 00:37:14.499 region:rollup2

00:37:12.230 --> 00:37:16.401 region:rollup2

THOSE WHO. SERVED IN COMBAT IT'S

00:39:02.507 --> 00:39:06.044 region:rollup2
ISOLATE AND SEPARATE THEM FROM

THOSE WHO HAVEN'T.

I PRESENTED OUR COUNTRY.

00:42:40.491 --> 00:42:46.130 region:rollup2
AT THE FINEST LEVELS.

00:42:43.127 --> 00:42:49.167 region:rollup2
I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE THAT AT ALL.

00:42:46.130 --> 00:42:51.436 region:rollup2
AND I GET PATS ON THE BACKS AND

00:42:49.167 --> 00:42:53.504 region:rollup2

PROUD THEY ARE OF ME.

00:42:53.504 --> 00:42:57.275 region:rollup2
THEY HAD NO TRUE UNDERSTANDING

00:42:54.605 --> 00:42:58.843 region:rollup2
OF HOW I FELT.

00:42:57.275 --> 00:43:00.978 region:rollup2
I WAS UNABLE TO LOVE I WAS

FRIENDS HIGH.

00:43:10.021 --> 00:43:14.492 region:rollup2
I CAN RELATE THERE WAS KNOWN

00:43:12.023 --> 00:43:18.663 region:rollup2
INTERACTION TO ME IN THEM THAT

00:43:14.492 --> 00:43:20.031 region:rollup2
WAS ON THE SAME LEVEL ANYMORE.

00:43:18.663 --> 00:43:21.365 region:rollup2
I ALWAYS KNEW I WANTED A HAND

00:43:20.031 --> 00:43:23.367 region:rollup2
GRENADE WITH WINGS TO ME THAT

00:43:21.365 --> 00:43:25.002 region:rollup2
DESCRIBES WHO I AM IN THIS WORLD

00:43:23.367 --> 00:43:26.537 region:rollup2
AS FAR AS.

00:43:25.002 --> 00:43:28.072 region:rollup2
I I FEEL LIKE THAT GRENADE WITH

00:43:26.537 --> 00:43:29.574 region:rollup2
THE PIN PULLED YOU NEVER KNOW

00:43:28.072 --> 00:43:32.009 region:rollup2
WHEN IT'S GOING TO GO OFF BUT

00:43:29.574 --> 00:43:32.610 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW EVENTUALLY IT DOES.

00:43:32.009 --> 00:43:34.212 region:rollup2
IN THE WINGS WERE SUPPOSED TO

00:43:32.610 --> 00:43:36.914 region:rollup2
MEAN.

00:43:34.212 --> 00:43:39.417 region:rollup2
MY JOURNEY THROUGH THIS WORLD.

00:43:36.914 --> 00:43:40.785 region:rollup2
AND. I DON'T KNOW WHO SAID IT

00:43:39.417 --> 00:43:42.053 region:rollup2
BUT SOMEONE SAID.

00:43:40.785 --> 00:43:43.454 region:rollup2
SERENITY IS NOT FREEDOM FROM THE

00:43:42.053 --> 00:43:46.991 region:rollup2
STORM.

00:43:43.454 --> 00:43:48.426 region:rollup2
YET IT IS PEACE AMID THE STORM.

00:43:46.991 --> 00:43:49.760 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S HOW I FEEL MY LIFE IS

00:43:48.426 --> 00:43:50.995 region:rollup2
THAT IT'S NOT GOING TO EVER BE

00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:51.529 region:rollup2
PERFECT AND IT'S GOING TO BE A

00:43:50.995 --> 00:43:53.764 region:rollup2
BATTLE AFTER BATTLE AFTER

00:43:51.529 --> 00:43:55.800 region:rollup2
BATTLE.

00:43:53.764 --> 00:43:58.469 region:rollup2
AND.

00:43:55.800 --> 00:44:00.471 region:rollup2
MY JOB ISN'T TO.

00:43:58.469 --> 00:44:02.406 region:rollup2
FIX EVERYTHING.

00:44:00.471 --> 00:44:06.177 region:rollup2
AND MAKE EVERYTHING PERFECT MY

00:44:02.406 --> 00:44:07.411 region:rollup2
JOB IS TO MAINTAIN. MY CALMNESS.

00:44:06.177 --> 00:44:10.948 region:rollup2
AND MY EMOTIONS. THROUGH THIS

00:44:07.411 --> 00:44:13.151 region:rollup2
BATTLE.

00:44:10.948 --> 00:44:14.819 region:rollup2
THAT HAD TO.

00:44:13.151 --> 00:44:16.454 region:rollup2
IS ALMOST A WAY TO KEEP MYSELF

00:44:14.819 --> 00:44:18.422 region:rollup2
IN CHECK WHEN I SEE IT.

00:44:16.454 --> 00:44:20.491 region:rollup2
IT REMINDS ME THAT.

00:44:18.422 --> 00:44:23.294 region:rollup2
I'M STRUGGLING TO GET TO A

00:44:20.491 --> 00:44:24.662 region:rollup2
HIGHER LEVEL OF ENLIGHTENMENT.

PRISON. AND WE HAVE A

00:58:53.830 --> 00:58:59.035 region:rollup2
HUMANITIES.

00:58:57.567 --> 00:59:01.471 region:rollup2
PROGRAM AND ALL ITS PROGRAM

00:58:59.035 --> 00:59:03.473 region:rollup2
CALLED WOOD DUNG CAGED WHICH ARE

00:59:01.471 --> 00:59:04.975 region:rollup2
ALL ALONG WITH THE MEN OF THE

00:59:03.473 --> 00:59:06.510 region:rollup2
ORDER THAT THE FOUNDERS OF AND

00:59:04.975 --> 00:59:09.246 region:rollup2
WE GOT OUR INITIAL FUNDING FROM

00:59:06.510 --> 00:59:10.013 region:rollup2
CAROL HUMANITIES THAT GOT THE

00:59:09.246 --> 00:59:13.050 region:rollup2
WHOLE THING OFF THE GROUND.

00:59:10.013 --> 00:59:16.153 region:rollup2
AND WHAT WE DO IN THE PROGRAM

00:59:13.050 --> 00:59:18.422 region:rollup2
WAS ON CAGED IS. IT REAL WAS

00:59:16.153 --> 00:59:20.057 region:rollup2
REALLY BORN FROM THE IDEA THAT.

00:59:18.422 --> 00:59:21.224 region:rollup2
ONCE YOU SPEND SOME TIME IN

00:59:20.057 --> 00:59:23.260 region:rollup2
PRISON ON.

00:59:21.224 --> 00:59:24.928 region:rollup2
BEEN TEACHING IN THERE FOR ABOUT

00:59:23.260 --> 00:59:26.730 region:rollup2
FIVE OR SIX YEARS NOW. YOU

00:59:24.928 --> 00:59:28.465 region:rollup2
REALIZE THAT THERE ARE SO MANY

00:59:26.730 --> 00:59:31.101 region:rollup2
ON TOLD STORIES AND POWERFUL

00:59:28.465 --> 00:59:33.070 region:rollup2
VOICES IN IN PRISON AND SO

00:59:31.101 --> 00:59:36.273 region:rollup2
WHAT'S UNCAGED AS A PLATFORM FOR

00:59:33.070 --> 00:59:37.607 region:rollup2
THOSE. VOICES TO BE HEARD BY THE

00:59:36.273 --> 00:59:39.576 region:rollup2
PUBLIC AND TO INTERACT WITH THE

00:59:37.607 --> 00:59:41.711 region:rollup2
WITH THE PUBLIC.

00:59:39.576 --> 00:59:43.280 region:rollup2
AND IT'S FOUNDED UPON THE

00:59:41.711 --> 00:59:45.882 region:rollup2
BELIEF THAT STORIES HAVE THE

00:59:43.280 --> 00:59:47.617 region:rollup2
ABILITY TO HEAL INDIVIDUAL LIVES

00:59:45.882 --> 00:59:50.720 region:rollup2
AND IMAGINE NEW COLLECTIVE

00:59:47.617 --> 00:59:53.390 region:rollup2
FUTURE. SO WE TRIED TO HAVE

00:59:50.720 --> 00:59:55.625 region:rollup2
STORYTELLING EXPERIENCES THE ALL

00:59:53.390 --> 00:59:56.827 region:rollup2
BASED IN THE PRISON BUT ALSO

00:59:55.625 --> 00:59:58.628 region:rollup2
BASED IN THE COMMUNITIES FROM

00:59:56.827 --> 01:00:00.597 region:rollup2
THE MAN FROM WHERE THE MEN. CAME

00:59:58.628 --> 01:00:01.698 region:rollup2
TO PRESENT AND THE IDEA HERE IS

01:00:00.597 --> 01:00:03.667 region:rollup2
THAT WE CAN.

01:00:01.698 --> 01:00:06.102 region:rollup2
DO SOME KIND OF COLLECTIVE

01:00:03.667 --> 01:00:07.637 region:rollup2
HEALING TOGETHER AND AND AND

01:00:06.102 --> 01:00:09.139 region:rollup2
HELP KIDS IN THOSE COMMUNITIES

01:00:07.637 --> 01:00:10.907 region:rollup2
THAT MAY BE ON THE PART OF THE

01:00:09.139 --> 01:00:12.309 region:rollup2
ENDED UP IN PRISON. OR INVOLVED

01:00:10.907 --> 01:00:13.977 region:rollup2
IN GANGS IN SOUTH LA IN THAT

01:00:12.309 --> 01:00:15.979 region:rollup2
KIND OF STUFF TO IMAGINE

01:00:13.977 --> 01:00:18.482 region:rollup2
ALTERNATIVES TO THAT AND SO THE

01:00:15.979 --> 01:00:20.484 region:rollup2
STORYTELLING PROCESS BECOMES. A

01:00:18.482 --> 01:00:22.752 region:rollup2
WAY OF DOING IT MUCH LIKE IT WAS

01:00:20.484 --> 01:00:24.254 region:rollup2
HERE IN. THE ANTI TALK ABOUT

01:00:22.752 --> 01:00:28.358 region:rollup2
EARLY ON.

01:00:24.254 --> 01:00:29.659 region:rollup2
SO IN THAT SENSE AND I'M I'M

01:00:28.358 --> 01:00:31.595 region:rollup2
KINDA TALKING ABOUT LITERATURE

01:00:29.659 --> 01:00:34.164 region:rollup2
IN ITS MOST EXPENSIVE SENTENCE

01:00:31.595 --> 01:00:36.666 region:rollup2
SAYS THAT AS A. AS A AS A WAVE

01:00:34.164 --> 01:00:38.368 region:rollup2
INCLUDING PEOPLE AND COMMUNITIES

01:00:36.666 --> 01:00:40.804 region:rollup2
SPELLING TELLING STORIES OF

01:00:38.368 --> 01:00:42.506 region:rollup2
PUBLIC HUMANITIES PROJECT RATHER

01:00:40.804 --> 01:00:44.140 region:rollup2
THAN GOING INTO PLACES AND.

01:00:42.506 --> 01:00:45.909 region:rollup2
NECESSARY TO JIM CANONICAL WORKS

01:00:44.140 --> 01:00:48.545 region:rollup2
OF THAT KIND OF THING.

01:00:45.909 --> 01:00:50.514 region:rollup2
AND BECAUSE THE GOAL OF OUR WORK

01:00:48.545 --> 01:00:52.916 region:rollup2
WITH WHAT'S ON CAGED IS TO

01:00:50.514 --> 01:00:53.450 region:rollup2
COLLAPSE THE DISTANCE BETWEEN

01:00:52.916 --> 01:00:55.585 region:rollup2
THE PRISON AND THE OUTSIDE

01:00:53.450 --> 01:00:57.387 region:rollup2
WORLD.

01:00:55.585 --> 01:00:59.656 region:rollup2
AND TO STRESS WHAT WE HAVE IN

01:00:57.387 --> 01:01:01.124 region:rollup2
COMMON AS HUMAN BEINGS OUR OUR

01:00:59.656 --> 01:01:04.160 region:rollup2
APPROACHES IS COLLABORATIVE AND

01:01:01.124 --> 01:01:05.729 region:rollup2
DIALOGICAL AS AS POSSIBLE. SO

01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:09.065 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE WE HAVE.

01:01:05.729 --> 01:01:11.568 region:rollup2
MY STUDENTS AT CAL STATE LA.

01:01:09.065 --> 01:01:12.636 region:rollup2
ONE OF WHOM IS HERE ACTUALLY TO

01:01:11.568 --> 01:01:15.672 region:rollup2
TO BE POP THE HEARING.

01:01:12.636 --> 01:01:17.607 region:rollup2
EDIT AND GIVE FEEDBACK AND

01:01:15.672 --> 01:01:19.876 region:rollup2
ENGAGE WITH THE PRISON RIGHTS IN

01:01:17.607 --> 01:01:20.844 region:rollup2
WHO. OFTEN YOU KNOW MANY OF

01:01:19.876 --> 01:01:22.879 region:rollup2
THESE MEN GO TO PRISON THE DEAN

01:01:20.844 --> 01:01:24.948 region:rollup2
DOWN TWENTY THIRTY FORTY YEARS

01:01:22.879 --> 01:01:25.982 region:rollup2
AND HAVE NEVER HAD ANYONE WRITE

01:01:24.948 --> 01:01:27.584 region:rollup2
TO THEM THEY'VE BECOME

01:01:25.982 --> 01:01:29.119 region:rollup2
DISENGAGED FROM THEIR FAMILY SO

01:01:27.584 --> 01:01:30.820 region:rollup2
THIS IS A WAY OF INTERACTING

01:01:29.119 --> 01:01:32.889 region:rollup2
ABOUT SOMETHING MEANINGFUL IN.

01:01:30.820 --> 01:01:33.857 region:rollup2
THE HUMANITIES IS THAT BRIDGE

01:01:32.889 --> 01:01:36.893 region:rollup2
THAT ENABLES THESE VERY

01:01:33.857 --> 01:01:37.427 region:rollup2
DISPARATE LIVES TO BE CONNECTED

01:01:36.893 --> 01:01:39.663 region:rollup2
THROUGH THESE DIALOGUES.

01:01:37.427 --> 01:01:42.799 region:rollup2
WE'VE HAD ACTORS PERFORM

01:01:39.663 --> 01:01:46.036 region:rollup2
DRAMATIC READINGS OF WRITINGS.

01:01:42.799 --> 01:01:47.737 region:rollup2
IN PUBLIC SETTINGS WE'VE HAD.

01:01:46.036 --> 01:01:49.139 region:rollup2
WOMAN PHOTOGRAPHERS THERE OR ON

01:01:47.737 --> 01:01:51.775 region:rollup2

PULL TRAITS OF THE MEN AND WE

01:01:51.775 --> 01:01:54.211 region:rollup2
HAVE A.

01:01:52.209 --> 01:01:56.213 region:rollup2
EVENT COMING UP AN EXHIBIT

01:01:54.211 --> 01:01:59.583 region:rollup2

.

01:02:12.796 --> 01:02:15.231 region:rollup2
AND AND THE WHOLE IDEA OF THIS

01:02:13.697 --> 01:02:16.333 region:rollup2
IS A SIZE TO USE THE HUMANITIES

01:02:15.231 --> 01:02:19.069 region:rollup2

01:02:31.281 --> 01:02:34.517 region:rollup2
PRISONS ARE VERY ISOLATED

01:02:32.916 --> 01:02:37.554 region:rollup2
LOCATIONS IN THE HIGH DESERT AND

01:02:34.517 --> 01:02:39.956 region:rollup2
PLACES LIKE THAT. AND. OBVIOUSLY

01:02:37.554 --> 01:02:40.957 region:rollup2
THE NATURE OF A PRISON IS IS ONE

01:02:39.956 --> 01:02:43.460 region:rollup2
OF NOT ALLOWING COMMUNICATION

01:02:40.957 --> 01:02:45.028 region:rollup2
AND SO FOR MANY OF THE MEN IN

01:02:43.460 --> 01:02:46.696 region:rollup2
THESE PHOTOS THAT YOU SEE HERE

01:02:45.028 --> 01:02:47.764 region:rollup2
THIS IS THE FIRST MEANINGFUL WAY

01:02:46.696 --> 01:02:50.533 region:rollup2
THEY'VE BEEN I WOULD SAY

01:02:47.764 --> 01:02:51.334 region:rollup2
INTERACT WITH THE OUTSIDE WORLD.

01:02:50.533 --> 01:02:53.303 region:rollup2
FOR YEARS.

01:02:51.334 --> 01:02:54.804 region:rollup2
I'M.

01:02:53.303 --> 01:02:56.640 region:rollup2
AND I JUST KIND OF ENUMERATE

01:02:54.804 --> 01:02:59.142 region:rollup2
WHAT WE FOUND THE HUMANITIES IN

01:02:56.640 --> 01:03:01.177 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR TO BE VALUABLE FOR IN

01:02:59.142 --> 01:03:01.945 region:rollup2
IN IN THIS DIALOGUE. I THINK THE

01:03:01.177 --> 01:03:04.547 region:rollup2
FIRST ONE IS.

01:03:01.945 --> 01:03:06.249 region:rollup2
HUMANITIES ALLOW US TO SEE WHY

01:03:04.547 --> 01:03:09.419 region:rollup2
THE STATIC BY MENTION OF VOICE

01:03:06.249 --> 01:03:10.620 region:rollup2
MASSES NOT JUST WHAT YOU SAY BUT

01:03:09.419 --> 01:03:13.323 region:rollup2
HOW YOU SAY IT.

01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:15.492 region:rollup2
THE THERE'S DIGNITY THAT COMES

01:03:13.323 --> 01:03:16.593 region:rollup2
FROM CLAIM IN ONE'S INDIVIDUAL

01:03:15.492 --> 01:03:18.495 region:rollup2
VOICE WHEN YOU HAVEN'T BEEN

01:03:16.593 --> 01:03:21.164 region:rollup2
ALLOWED TO SPEAK THAT IT IT'S

01:03:18.495 --> 01:03:21.998 region:rollup2
IT'S AFFIRMATIVE AND. GIVES A

01:03:21.164 --> 01:03:23.933 region:rollup2
SENSE OF DIGNITY.

01:03:21.998 --> 01:03:26.136 region:rollup2
THE EMPATHY COMES FROM LISTENING

01:03:23.933 --> 01:03:26.870 region:rollup2
IN OR READING OTHER PEOPLE'S

01:03:26.136 --> 01:03:29.839 region:rollup2
STORIES.

01:03:26.870 --> 01:03:31.975 region:rollup2
WITH CASH.

01:03:29.839 --> 01:03:33.309 region:rollup2
AND THE POSITIVE SOCIAL CHANGE

01:03:31.975 --> 01:03:35.278 region:rollup2
CAN BEGIN WITH THE STORY

01:03:33.309 --> 01:03:36.646 region:rollup2
STORYTELLING PROCESS EVERYTHING

01:03:35.278 --> 01:03:38.314 region:rollup2
WE SEE IN THIS ROOM EVERYTHING

01:03:36.646 --> 01:03:40.483 region:rollup2
WITH POLITICS AT SOME POINT IS

01:03:38.314 --> 01:03:41.318 region:rollup2
AN IMAGINED POSSIBILITY. SO THE

01:03:40.483 --> 01:03:43.053 region:rollup2
HUMANITIES.

01:03:41.318 --> 01:03:45.288 region:rollup2
GIVE US THAT FRAMEWORK TO

01:03:43.053 --> 01:03:46.856 region:rollup2
IMAGINE ALL THE POSSIBILITIES

01:03:45.288 --> 01:03:48.458 region:rollup2
THAN BEING A GANG MEMBER WILL GO

01:03:46.856 --> 01:03:50.293 region:rollup2
TO PRISON LIKE YOUR YOUR FAMILY

01:03:48.458 --> 01:03:52.262 region:rollup2
MAY HAVE THOUGHT.

01:03:50.293 --> 01:03:53.563 region:rollup2
I'M AM WITHOUT THE HUMANITIES I

01:03:52.262 --> 01:03:54.798 region:rollup2
DON'T THINK WE HAVE TO THINK

01:03:53.563 --> 01:03:56.199 region:rollup2
THROUGH A LOT THE DECISIONS WE

01:03:54.798 --> 01:03:58.168 region:rollup2
HAVE TO MAKE IN WORDS ON

01:03:56.199 --> 01:03:59.602 region:rollup2
OCCASIONAL THE PRODUCTION. SO TO

01:03:58.168 --> 01:04:00.637 region:rollup2
GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF THIS.

01:03:59.602 --> 01:04:02.072 region:rollup2
.

01:04:00.637 --> 01:04:04.107 region:rollup2
BEAUTY AND DIGNITY A KIND OF

01:04:02.072 --> 01:04:05.375 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT WORDS TO OUR PROJECT

01:04:04.107 --> 01:04:06.976 region:rollup2
AND AND THIS GOES ALL THE WY

01:04:05.375 --> 01:04:08.678 region:rollup2
DOWN TO THE KIND OF MICRO

01:04:06.976 --> 01:04:10.313 region:rollup2
DECISIONS WE MAKE IN ALL

01:04:08.678 --> 01:04:11.848 region:rollup2
PROJECTS SO IN THE BOOK. WE

01:04:10.313 --> 01:04:13.717 region:rollup2
ENDED UP SPENDING MORE OF THE

01:04:11.848 --> 01:04:15.385 region:rollup2
CAST HUMANITIES GRANT THEN WE

01:04:13.717 --> 01:04:17.120 region:rollup2
THOUGHT WE WOULD ON ON PRINTING

01:04:15.385 --> 01:04:19.122 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE WANTED TO USE REALLY

01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:20.323 region:rollup2
HIGH QUALITY PIPE. ONCE I TOOK

01:04:19.122 --> 01:04:22.659 region:rollup2
THE PAPER SAMPLES INTO THE

01:04:20.323 --> 01:04:22.926 region:rollup2
PRISON WHERE WE WOULD PRODUCE IN

01:04:22.659 --> 01:04:23.960 region:rollup2
THE BOOK.

01:04:22.926 --> 01:04:25.895 region:rollup2
.

01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:27.731 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW. MANY OF THE LAW FOR

01:04:25.895 --> 01:04:28.531 region:rollup2
THAT PROGRAM AS IT NEVER TOUCHED

01:04:27.731 --> 01:04:31.434 region:rollup2
A PIECE OF PAPER LIKE THAT

01:04:28.531 --> 01:04:32.369 region:rollup2
BEFORE. AND SO LIKE FOR ALLAH IS

01:04:31.434 --> 01:04:34.037 region:rollup2
THEY JUST YOU KNOW TOUCHING THE

01:04:32.369 --> 01:04:35.438 region:rollup2
PAPER AND IT AND IT SIGNALLED

01:04:34.037 --> 01:04:37.207 region:rollup2
SOMETHING TO THEM THAT THIS

01:04:35.438 --> 01:04:38.742 region:rollup2
STORY IS THE WORST THAT WE'RE

01:04:37.207 --> 01:04:40.477 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE PRINTED ON THIS. ARE

01:04:38.742 --> 01:04:42.112 region:rollup2
OF WORTH AND AND SO THAT WAS

01:04:40.477 --> 01:04:44.047 region:rollup2
KIND OF HUMAN VALUE THAT CAME

01:04:42.112 --> 01:04:45.915 region:rollup2
FROM THAT DECISION SO THERE WERE

01:04:44.047 --> 01:04:48.618 region:rollup2
NUMEROUS KIND OF THE. DECISIONS

01:04:45.915 --> 01:04:50.220 region:rollup2
WE MAKE THROUGH THE PROJECT.

01:04:48.618 --> 01:04:53.957 region:rollup2
SUCH AS THAT.

01:04:50.220 --> 01:04:56.192 region:rollup2
ENDS UP JUST THE KIND OF.

01:04:53.957 --> 01:04:58.228 region:rollup2
WE SAW BROUGHT THEIR FACES INTO

01:04:56.192 --> 01:04:58.795 region:rollup2
THE ROOM BUT I ALWAYS FEEL AT A

UNEASY SPEAK IN BEHALF OF THE

01:05:01.030 --> 01:05:04.667 region:rollup2
PROJECT BECAUSE IT'S A

01:05:02.465 --> 01:05:06.202 region:rollup2
COLLECTIVE AND THE MEN IN PRISON

01:05:04.667 --> 01:05:08.204 region:rollup2

THEY CAN'T PHYSICALLY BE HERE TO

01:05:09.672 --> 01:05:16.613 region:rollup2
SPEAK SO I WANTED TO READ A FEW

01:05:11.441 --> 01:05:17.614 region:rollup2

ANYTHING TO SAY THAT WOULD BE

01:07:54.103 --> 01:07:56.606 region:rollup2
WORTHY OF PRINTED.

YEARS OR MORE CONSTANTLY SEEKING

01:08:22.932 --> 01:08:26.569 region:rollup2
SELF REHABILITATION. NOT BECAUSE

01:08:28.371 --> 01:08:32.075 region:rollup2
LIFE WITHOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF

01:08:29.906 --> 01:08:33.610 region:rollup2
PAROLE CAUSES PEOPLE TO BECOME

01:08:32.075 --> 01:08:35.345 region:rollup2
EXTREMELY HOPELESS AND

01:08:33.610 --> 01:08:37.380 region:rollup2
DESPONDENCY BECOMES A NORMAL

01:08:35.345 --> 01:08:39.182 region:rollup2

HAPPENED SHE DIDN'T HAVE NAMES

01:11:54.477 --> 01:11:58.915 region:rollup2
OF PEOPLE SHE DIDN'T KNOW WHO

01:11:57.180 --> 01:12:00.316 region:rollup2
THEY WERE FOR THE MOST PART.

01:11:58.915 --> 01:12:01.717 region:rollup2
OTHER THAN THE ONES WHO ARE

01:12:00.316 --> 01:12:03.085 region:rollup2

TRAVIS AND WORK AND SO ON.

01:12:03.085 --> 01:12:06.189 region:rollup2
WHAT SHE CAPTURED IN A WAY THAT

01:12:05.421 --> 01:12:08.858 region:rollup2
I THINK?

01:12:06.189 --> 01:12:10.326 region:rollup2
NO ONE ELSE I'VE SEEN DEED IS

01:12:08.858 --> 01:12:12.361 region:rollup2
WHAT THIS MEANT TO THE PEOPLE

01:12:10.326 --> 01:12:14.397 region:rollup2
WHO WERE LEARNING HOW TO

01:12:12.361 --> 01:12:16.399 region:rollup2
ORGANIZE AND AND AND BEING ABLE

01:12:14.397 --> 01:12:18.367 region:rollup2
TO. EXERCISE THEIR RIGHTS

01:12:16.399 --> 01:12:22.205 region:rollup2
STOPPED THERE FOR SUCK ON THEIR

01:12:18.367 --> 01:12:25.007 region:rollup2
RIGHTS TO. TO US TO PARTICIPATE

01:12:22.205 --> 01:12:25.908 region:rollup2
IN A DEMOCRATIC PROCESS THAT

01:12:25.007 --> 01:12:27.677 region:rollup2
MOST OF THEM HAD NEVER.

01:12:25.908 --> 01:12:28.778 region:rollup2
DONE BEFORE REMOTE MOST MANY OF

01:12:27.677 --> 01:12:30.213 region:rollup2
THE FARM WORKERS AND NEVER VOTED

01:12:28.778 --> 01:12:31.847 region:rollup2
IN THEIR LIVES IN ANY KIND OF

01:12:30.213 --> 01:12:34.083 region:rollup2
ELECTION MUCH LESS A UNION

01:12:31.847 --> 01:12:37.019 region:rollup2
ELECTION THE TEATRO CAMPESINO

01:12:34.083 --> 01:12:39.155 region:rollup2
LUIS VALDEZ. WAS A PART OF THIS

01:12:37.019 --> 01:12:41.858 region:rollup2
THEY PERFORMED AND IN SORT OF

01:12:39.155 --> 01:12:42.425 region:rollup2
LITTLE FARM TOWNS UP AND DOWN

01:12:41.858 --> 01:12:43.659 region:rollup2
THE COAST AND IN THE CENTRAL

01:12:42.425 --> 01:12:44.427 region:rollup2

01:12:43.659 --> 01:12:46.362 region:rollup2
WHEN SHE CAPTURED THIS WHOLE

01:12:44.427 --> 01:12:47.630 region:rollup2
RECORD. SO WE BEGAN TO THINK

01:12:46.362 --> 01:12:49.298 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHAT WAS THE WAY TO PUT

01:12:47.630 --> 01:12:50.800 region:rollup2
THIS TOGETHER IN A WAY INTO THAT

01:12:49.298 --> 01:12:51.901 region:rollup2
WOULD CAPTURE THIS HISTORY AND

01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:54.103 region:rollup2
MAKE IT MEANINGFUL TO PEOPLE

01:12:51.901 --> 01:12:56.105 region:rollup2
TODAY. AND BE ABLE TO SORT OF

01:12:54.103 --> 01:12:58.574 region:rollup2
TELL THE STORY OF PEOPLE WHO

01:12:56.105 --> 01:13:00.943 region:rollup2
WERE STILL AROUND MANY OF THEM.

01:12:58.574 --> 01:13:02.511 region:rollup2
AND BUT BUT HAD NO SENSE OF

01:13:00.943 --> 01:13:04.680 region:rollup2
THEIR OWN HISTORY IN SOME LEVEL

01:13:02.511 --> 01:13:06.382 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY HAD NOT CAPTURED

01:13:04.680 --> 01:13:09.418 region:rollup2

THEY'RE STILL IN THE MIDDLE OF

01:18:08.751 --> 01:18:10.286 region:rollup2

DIED WITH THE LAST

01:18:41.917 --> 01:18:42.718 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION.

01:18:42.284 --> 01:18:44.353 region:rollup2

LITTLE THERE. AND THEN THE LAST

01:18:55.764 --> 01:18:59.301 region:rollup2
TIME I WENT IT WAS SO IMPRESSED

01:18:57.366 --> 01:19:01.837 region:rollup2
WITH THIS. EXTRAORDINARY MUSEUM

01:18:59.301 --> 01:19:03.072 region:rollup2

IT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE

01:19:19.355 --> 01:19:23.092 region:rollup2
COMPLICATED BECAUSE THE TERMS OF

01:19:21.390 --> 01:19:24.426 region:rollup2
THE DEAL ARE THAT THEY ARE SORT

01:19:23.092 --> 01:19:26.462 region:rollup2

PROCESS OF NEGOTIATION ON ON

01:19:30.532 --> 01:19:33.068 region:rollup2
THAT BECAUSE THE FAMILY IS A LOT

01:19:31.667 --> 01:19:34.903 region:rollup2
OF CONTROL OVER HOW THE STORIES

I WANT TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY

01:31:56.978 --> 01:32:01.383 region:rollup2
ABOUT A SECRET SUPER POWER OF

01:32:00.115 --> 01:32:03.852 region:rollup2
MUSEUMS AND CULTURAL

01:32:01.383 --> 01:32:05.687 region:rollup2
INSTITUTIONS. AND IT'S THE POWER

01:32:03.852 --> 01:32:06.721 region:rollup2
TO BRIDGE COMMUNITIES AND I'M

01:32:05.687 --> 01:32:08.656 region:rollup2
USING THIS TERM NOT

01:32:06.721 --> 01:32:10.525 region:rollup2
EUPHEMISTICALLY BUT SPECIFICALLY

01:32:08.656 --> 01:32:11.993 region:rollup2
WHEN WE THINK ABOUT HOW WE BUILD

01:32:10.525 --> 01:32:13.962 region:rollup2
SOCIAL CAPITAL IN COMMUNITIES.

01:32:11.993 --> 01:32:15.930 region:rollup2
AND WE LIVE IN A VERY DIVIDED

01:32:13.962 --> 01:32:17.465 region:rollup2
WORLD A VERY DIVIDED COUNTRY AND

01:32:15.930 --> 01:32:19.434 region:rollup2
A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE THEORIZED

01:32:17.465 --> 01:32:21.136 region:rollup2
THAT ONE OF THE CORE REASONS FOR

01:32:19.434 --> 01:32:22.237 region:rollup2
OUR DIVISIONS IS WE NOW LIVE IN

01:32:21.136 --> 01:32:23.705 region:rollup2
A WORLD WHERE THERE ARE A LOT OF

01:32:22.237 --> 01:32:25.907 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITIES TO BOND WITH

01:32:23.705 --> 01:32:27.675 region:rollup2
PEOPLE. WHO SHARE YOUR RACE

01:32:25.907 --> 01:32:29.210 region:rollup2
GENDER CLASS IDENTITY AND VERY

01:32:27.675 --> 01:32:30.779 region:rollup2
FEW OPPORTUNITIES TO BRIDGE WITH

01:32:29.210 --> 01:32:33.281 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WHO ARE TRULY DIFFERENT

01:32:30.779 --> 01:32:34.616 region:rollup2
FROM YOU? MUSEUMS AND CULTURAL

01:32:33.281 --> 01:32:36.217 region:rollup2
INSTITUTIONS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN

01:32:34.616 --> 01:32:38.186 region:rollup2
GREAT PLACES TO BOND YOU KNOW WE

01:32:36.217 --> 01:32:40.822 region:rollup2
LOVE SEEING FAMILIES ENJOY OUR

01:32:38.186 --> 01:32:42.891 region:rollup2
MUSEUM. BUT WE'VE REALLY DECIDED

01:32:40.822 --> 01:32:44.993 region:rollup2
THAT OUR PRIMARY FOCUS SHOULD BE

01:32:42.891 --> 01:32:46.394 region:rollup2
NOT ON BONDING BUT I'M BRIDGING

01:32:44.993 --> 01:32:48.229 region:rollup2
AND I'M BEING A SPACE WHERE

01:32:46.394 --> 01:32:49.230 region:rollup2
PEOPLE CAN FORM CONNECTIONS WITH

01:32:48.229 --> 01:32:51.132 region:rollup2
PEOPLE FROM DIFFERENT WALKS OF

01:32:49.230 --> 01:32:52.267 region:rollup2
LIFE. DIFFERENT AGES DIFFERENT

01:32:51.132 --> 01:32:54.669 region:rollup2
BACKGROUNDS DIFFERENT

01:32:52.267 --> 01:32:56.438 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCES I'M I'M SURE YOU'VE

01:32:54.669 --> 01:32:57.405 region:rollup2
SEEN THE RESEARCH ON THE

01:32:56.438 --> 01:32:59.340 region:rollup2
INTERCESSORY OF BRIDGING

01:32:57.405 --> 01:33:00.608 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES WHEN WE TALK ABOUT

01:32:59.340 --> 01:33:01.743 region:rollup2
SOCIAL COHESION WHEN WE TALK

01:33:00.608 --> 01:33:03.578 region:rollup2
ABOUT PUBLIC HEALTH WHEN WE TALK

01:33:01.743 --> 01:33:04.813 region:rollup2
ABOUT PUBLIC SAFETY. A LOT OF IT

01:33:03.578 --> 01:33:06.448 region:rollup2
COMES DOWN TO LOOKING AT

01:33:04.813 --> 01:33:08.049 region:rollup2
STRANGERS ON THE STREET AND

01:33:06.448 --> 01:33:09.684 region:rollup2
SEEING THEM AS POTENTIAL FRIENDS

01:33:08.049 --> 01:33:11.019 region:rollup2
INSTEAD OF POTENTIAL THREATS.

01:33:09.684 --> 01:33:12.487 region:rollup2
AND ONE OF THE MORE SURPRISING

01:33:11.019 --> 01:33:14.489 region:rollup2
PIECES OF ESEARCH I THINK ABOUT

01:33:12.487 --> 01:33:16.691 region:rollup2
BRIDGING IS THAT ONE OF THE MOST

01:33:14.489 --> 01:33:17.859 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVE WAYS TO BRIDGE PEOPLE

01:33:16.691 --> 01:33:19.494 region:rollup2
FROM DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS IS

01:33:17.859 --> 01:33:21.096 region:rollup2
THROUGH CREATIVE EXPRESSION

01:33:19.494 --> 01:33:22.430 region:rollup2
MAKING SOMETHING TOGETHER. AND

01:33:21.096 --> 01:33:23.531 region:rollup2
THROUGH SHARING IN CELEBRATING

01:33:22.430 --> 01:33:24.833 region:rollup2
CULTURAL HERITAGE.

01:33:23.531 --> 01:33:26.201 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WHEN WE MAKE SOMETHING

01:33:24.833 --> 01:33:27.469 region:rollup2
TOGETHER WE'RE GETTING

01:33:26.201 --> 01:33:29.370 region:rollup2
COMFORTABLE WHETHER IT'S JUST

01:33:27.469 --> 01:33:30.839 region:rollup2
PASSING THE SCISSORS AND GLUE OR

01:33:29.370 --> 01:33:32.240 region:rollup2
WHETHER IT'S PAINTING THAT MURAL

01:33:30.839 --> 01:33:33.641 region:rollup2
I'M AND WHEN WE SHARE STORIES

01:33:32.240 --> 01:33:35.577 region:rollup2
FROM OUR DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS

01:33:33.641 --> 01:33:37.145 region:rollup2
WE START TO SEE THOSE UNEXPECTED

01:33:35.577 --> 01:33:38.780 region:rollup2
CONNECTIONS. THAT BRING US

01:33:37.145 --> 01:33:41.015 region:rollup2
TOGETHER IN EMPATHY AND SHARED

01:33:38.780 --> 01:33:43.084 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING I'M AND SO AT OUR

01:33:41.015 --> 01:33:44.619 region:rollup2
MUSEUM IN SANTA CRUZ WE REALLY

01:33:43.084 --> 01:33:46.187 region:rollup2
FOCUS ON HOW WE CAN DESIGN

01:33:44.619 --> 01:33:47.922 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCES TO BRIDGE

01:33:46.187 --> 01:33:50.992 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES I'M MORE PROUD OF

01:33:47.922 --> 01:33:51.626 region:rollup2
THE HUNDRED THOUSAND PLUS PEOPLE

01:33:50.992 --> 01:33:52.527 region:rollup2
WHO VISIT EVERY YEAR. BUT WORRY

01:33:51.626 --> 01:33:54.295 region:rollup2
I'M MORE GRATEFUL TO THE TWO

01:33:52.527 --> 01:33:56.264 region:rollup2
THOUSAND LOCAL PARTNERS WE WORK

01:33:54.295 --> 01:33:57.398 region:rollup2
WITH EVERY YEAR HERE JUST FIFTY

01:33:56.264 --> 01:33:59.267 region:rollup2
OF THEM AND I LOOK AT THIS

01:33:57.398 --> 01:34:01.569 region:rollup2
PICTURE I SEE A LIBRARIAN I SEE

01:33:59.267 --> 01:34:03.505 region:rollup2
A COUNTY SUPERVISOR. I SEE A

01:34:01.569 --> 01:34:05.039 region:rollup2
BIKE MESSENGER I SEE A PUBLIC

01:34:03.505 --> 01:34:06.374 region:rollup2
HEALTH WORKER I SEE PEOPLE

01:34:05.039 --> 01:34:08.676 region:rollup2
REFLECTING VERY DIFFERENT

01:34:06.374 --> 01:34:10.378 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES IN OUR COUNTY WHO

01:34:08.676 --> 01:34:11.646 region:rollup2
ARE USING THE MUSEUM AS A PLACE

01:34:10.378 --> 01:34:12.547 region:rollup2
TO BUILD BRIDGES ACROSS

01:34:11.646 --> 01:34:14.616 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCES.

01:34:12.547 --> 01:34:16.284 region:rollup2
WE DESIGN INTO THE PROGRAMS WE

01:34:14.616 --> 01:34:18.286 region:rollup2
CO PRODUCED WITH PARTNERS AND WE

01:34:16.284 --> 01:34:20.088 region:rollup2
PHYSICALLY DESIGN INTO THE SPACE

01:34:18.286 --> 01:34:21.990 region:rollup2
CREATING WAYS TO ENCOURAGE AND

01:34:20.088 --> 01:34:23.958 region:rollup2
INVITE PEOPLE TO MEET A STRANGER

01:34:21.990 --> 01:34:25.760 region:rollup2
IN THE EXHIBIT. TO SHARE STORIES

01:34:23.958 --> 01:34:26.861 region:rollup2

WE'VE DONE PROJECTS ON FOSTER

01:34:29.497 --> 01:34:32.200 region:rollup2
CARE.

01:34:30.431 --> 01:34:34.135 region:rollup2
THIS IS AN EXHIBITION WE JUST

CREATED THESE PIECES ARE THIS IS

01:34:48.349 --> 01:34:51.085 region:rollup2
A PICTURE.

01:34:49.284 --> 01:34:52.320 region:rollup2
FROM THE OPENING OF JUST A FEW

01:34:51.085 --> 01:34:53.488 region:rollup2
OF THE TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY

01:34:52.320 --> 01:34:55.623 region:rollup2
FIVE ARTISTS INVOLVED IN THIS

01:34:53.488 --> 01:34:56.991 region:rollup2
EXHIBITION. MEETING EACH OTHER

01:34:55.623 --> 01:34:59.661 region:rollup2
FOR THE FIRST TIME THROUGH THIS

01:34:56.991 --> 01:35:00.562 region:rollup2
PROJECT SEEING AND BEING SEEN BY

01:34:59.661 --> 01:35:01.930 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT PEOPLE IN OUR

01:35:00.562 --> 01:35:03.631 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY BECAUSE OF THE POWER

01:35:01.930 --> 01:35:06.234 region:rollup2
OF THIS EXHIBITION.

01:35:03.631 --> 01:35:09.204 region:rollup2
AND SO I'M HERE TODAY.

01:35:06.234 --> 01:35:11.306 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT WHAT WE

01:35:09.204 --> 01:35:13.274 region:rollup2
LIVE IN A DIVIDED WORLD. IT'S A

01:35:11.306 --> 01:35:15.543 region:rollup2
WORLD THAT THOSE DIVISIONS

01:35:13.274 --> 01:35:17.278 region:rollup2
CAUSED ME A LOT OF STRESS BUT I

01:35:15.543 --> 01:35:18.646 region:rollup2
FIND AND TAKE A LOT OF HOPE IN

01:35:17.278 --> 01:35:21.049 region:rollup2
THE OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD THESE

01:35:18.646 --> 01:35:22.750 region:rollup2
BRIDGES AND TO CHANGE AND SHIFT

01:35:21.049 --> 01:35:24.385 region:rollup2
THAT DIVISION. THROUGH THESE

01:35:22.750 --> 01:35:26.354 region:rollup2
CULTURAL PROJECTS THROUGH THESE

01:35:24.385 --> 01:35:28.222 region:rollup2
CREATIVE PROJECTS I'M AND I

01:35:26.354 --> 01:35:30.925 region:rollup2
REALLY WANT TO INVITE AND ASK

01:35:28.222 --> 01:35:32.427 region:rollup2
YOU TODAY TO DO TWO THINGS.

01:35:30.925 --> 01:35:34.629 region:rollup2
FIRST TO SUPPORT THIS BRIDGE

01:35:32.427 --> 01:35:36.164 region:rollup2
BUILDING WORK AND EVEN MORE

01:35:34.629 --> 01:35:38.366 region:rollup2
IMPORTANTLY TO HOLD US TO IT

01:35:36.164 --> 01:35:39.734 region:rollup2
BECAUSE FRANKLY YOU HAVE A SUPER

01:35:38.366 --> 01:35:42.370 region:rollup2
POWER THAT WE DON'T HAVE.

01:35:39.734 --> 01:35:43.204 region:rollup2
MUSEUMS IN PARTICULAR OUR

01:35:42.370 --> 01:35:44.472 region:rollup2
FRIENDS IN LIBRARIES ARE

01:35:43.204 --> 01:35:46.975 region:rollup2
PUBLICLY SUPPORTED WHICH IS

01:35:44.472 --> 01:35:48.243 region:rollup2
AWESOME BUT MUSEUMS THEATERS

01:35:46.975 --> 01:35:50.211 region:rollup2
OTHER CULTURAL INSTITUTIONS THAT

01:35:48.243 --> 01:35:52.080 region:rollup2
ARE PRIVATE NON PROFITS. FRANKLY

01:35:50.211 --> 01:35:53.448 region:rollup2
IT'S OUR CHOICE WHETHER WE

01:35:52.080 --> 01:35:54.949 region:rollup2
DECIDE TO BE A PLACE THAT

01:35:53.448 --> 01:35:56.618 region:rollup2
BRIDGES OR WHETHER WE DECIDE TO

01:35:54.949 --> 01:35:57.752 region:rollup2
BE A BOND A PLACE FOR A CERTAIN

01:35:56.618 --> 01:35:59.253 region:rollup2
KIND OF PERSON AND A CERTAIN

01:35:57.752 --> 01:36:00.822 region:rollup2
KIND OF BACKGROUND. AND ONE

01:35:59.253 --> 01:36:02.357 region:rollup2
PUBLIC MONEY COMES INTO THE

01:36:00.822 --> 01:36:04.125 region:rollup2
PROGRAM IT CHANGES THE

01:36:02.357 --> 01:36:06.194 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABILITY TO THAT SENSE

01:36:04.125 --> 01:36:07.228 region:rollup2
THAT WE NEED TO NOT JUST BE FOR

01:36:06.194 --> 01:36:08.496 region:rollup2
PEOPLE OF A CERTAIN CLASS

01:36:07.228 --> 01:36:09.631 region:rollup2
BACKGROUND A CERTAIN RACIAL

01:36:08.496 --> 01:36:11.599 region:rollup2
BACKGROUND CERTAIN EDUCATION

01:36:09.631 --> 01:36:13.768 region:rollup2
BACKGROUND. BUT THAT WE CAN AND

01:36:11.599 --> 01:36:15.270 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE PLACES THAT ARE OF BY

01:36:13.768 --> 01:36:17.772 region:rollup2
AND FOR EVERYONE IN OUR

01:36:15.270 --> 01:36:19.707 region:rollup2

THINK ABOUT HOW WE CAN USE

CULTURE AND HUMANITIES. TO BUILD

01:36:24.612 --> 01:36:28.283 region:rollup2
BRIDGES AND HOW WE CAN USE THE

01:36:26.314 --> 01:36:30.084 region:rollup2
UNIQUE SUPER POWERS THAT WE HAVE

01:36:28.283 --> 01:36:31.486 region:rollup2
TO PUSH FOR MORE OF THIS KIND OF

01:36:30.084 --> 01:36:33.788 region:rollup2

01:36:42.964 --> 01:36:46.200 region:rollup2
STRONGER STATE.

VIRUS SO MERRIAM'S WORK RIGHT

01:42:54.902 --> 01:42:57.204 region:rollup2
HAS BEEN FOUNDATIONAL AND

01:42:56.137 --> 01:42:59.040 region:rollup2
NEARING THE FARM WORKER MOVEMENT

01:42:57.204 --> 01:43:00.341 region:rollup2

MY WORK CUT TRIES TO GO BEYOND

01:43:00.341 --> 01:43:03.778 region:rollup2
IT. TO TRIAL TO TELL WHAT KIND

01:43:02.476 --> 01:43:05.312 region:rollup2
OF URBAN STORY OF. RACIAL

01:43:03.778 --> 01:43:06.747 region:rollup2
SEGREGATION CIVIL RIGHTS AND

01:43:05.312 --> 01:43:07.848 region:rollup2
LABOR RIGHTS THAT GO BEYOND THE

01:43:06.747 --> 01:43:09.583 region:rollup2
ISSUES OF FARM LABOR.

01:43:07.848 --> 01:43:11.118 region:rollup2

OF THE NWC P. THE WAR ON POVERTY

01:43:15.890 --> 01:43:19.493 region:rollup2
SCHOOL DESEGREGATION. TO TRY

01:43:17.758 --> 01:43:20.861 region:rollup2
AGAIN TELL URBAN STORY AND WHAT

01:43:19.493 --> 01:43:23.064 region:rollup2
A LOT OF THE OUTSIDE WORLD THAT

01:43:20.861 --> 01:43:24.565 region:rollup2
CONSIDERS A A RURAL COMMUNITY

01:43:23.064 --> 01:43:25.566 region:rollup2
WRITES I TRY TO GO BEYOND THAT.

01:43:24.565 --> 01:43:27.001 region:rollup2
AND YOU ASK YOU ALSO ASK

01:43:25.566 --> 01:43:28.002 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS EARLIER ABOUT THE

NATIONAL PARK SERVICE AND AND

01:43:28.002 --> 01:43:31.672 region:rollup2
THIS IS HOW THIS NATION WE JUST

01:43:29.537 --> 01:43:32.673 region:rollup2
POSTED ABOUT TWENTY OF FOLKS WHO

01:43:31.672 --> 01:43:34.542 region:rollup2
CAME IN FROM ACROSS THE COUNTRY

01:43:32.673 --> 01:43:36.077 region:rollup2
WITH NPS IN DELANO.

01:43:34.542 --> 01:43:37.978 region:rollup2
TO IT TO TOUR HISTORIC SITES

01:43:36.077 --> 01:43:39.847 region:rollup2
AND THEN GO UP TO KEEN BECAUSE

01:43:37.978 --> 01:43:41.048 region:rollup2
THE IDEA IS TO DOEXACTLY WHAT

01:43:39.847 --> 01:43:42.817 region:rollup2
YOU TALK ABOUT WITH WITH BANDS

01:43:41.048 --> 01:43:44.785 region:rollup2
ARE REALLY PUSH THAT HARD. BUT

01:43:42.817 --> 01:43:46.554 region:rollup2
IT REQUIRES THE PUBLIC PRIVATE

01:43:44.785 --> 01:43:47.021 region:rollup2
PARTNERSHIPS REQUIRES

01:43:46.554 --> 01:43:48.122 region:rollup2
INTEGRATION IN SCHOOL

01:43:47.021 --> 01:43:49.323 region:rollup2
CURRICULUM.

01:43:48.122 --> 01:43:50.591 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S THAT'S SOME OF THE

01:43:49.323 --> 01:43:52.393 region:rollup2
WORK THAT I'M DOING IT AGAIN THE

01:43:50.591 --> 01:43:52.993 region:rollup2
MORE THAT WE CAN HIGHLIGHT THAT

01:43:52.393 --> 01:43:53.894 region:rollup2
RICH LEGACY THE FARM WORKER

01:43:52.993 --> 01:43:55.696 region:rollup2

IT BENEFITS OUR STUDENTS ARE

01:43:55.696 --> 01:44:00.134 region:rollup2

TWO THAT ARE GETTING THE MOST

01:44:07.508 --> 01:44:10.111 region:rollup2
ATTENTION.

01:44:08.175 --> 01:44:11.245 region:rollup2
AND AGAIN OF COURSE THE SITE UP

01:44:10.111 --> 01:44:12.546 region:rollup2
IN IN THE KEEN BUT AGAIN IT

01:44:11.245 --> 01:44:14.281 region:rollup2
WOULD BE A SORT OF I THINK I TRY

01:44:12.546 --> 01:44:15.649 region:rollup2
PART RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SOME

01:44:14.281 --> 01:44:16.984 region:rollup2

BUT IN REALITY AGAIN IT'S THE

01:44:23.290 --> 01:44:26.260 region:rollup2
THE RICH LEGACY OF THE AREA AND

01:44:24.758 --> 01:44:28.095 region:rollup2
WE WNT TO MAKE THAT AGAIN AT A

01:44:26.260 --> 01:44:29.964 region:rollup2
REGIONAL RESOURCE. SURE SURE

01:44:28.095 --> 01:44:31.232 region:rollup2

ART OF RELEVANCE IS THIS. ALONG

01:45:46.440 --> 01:45:48.842 region:rollup2
THE LINES OF WHAT YOU WERE

01:45:47.041 --> 01:45:50.177 region:rollup2
DESCRIBING TRYING TO MAKE

01:45:48.842 --> 01:45:52.713 region:rollup2
MUSEUMS IN THE TWENTY FIRST

01:45:50.177 --> 01:45:53.681 region:rollup2
CENTURY MORE RELEVANT TO BROADER

MUSEUMS AS WELL AS THEATERS

01:45:59.420 --> 01:46:03.023 region:rollup2
LIBRARIES PARKS THAT ARE.

01:46:01.021 --> 01:46:04.425 region:rollup2
WORKING ON HOW THEY CAN INVITE

01:46:03.023 --> 01:46:06.060 region:rollup2
PEOPLE TO NOT JUST BE CONSUMERS

01:46:04.425 --> 01:46:07.228 region:rollup2

PARTICIPATORY MUSEUM IN TWO

01:46:07.228 --> 01:46:10.864 region:rollup2
THOUSAND TEN WAS REALLY FOCUSED

01:46:09.430 --> 01:46:11.765 region:rollup2
ON THAT HAPPENING IN MUSEUMS.

01:46:10.864 --> 01:46:13.267 region:rollup2
THE ART OF RELEVANCE.

01:46:11.765 --> 01:46:15.069 region:rollup2
WHICH CAME OUT JUST A COUPLE OF

01:46:13.267 --> 01:46:16.637 region:rollup2
YEARS AGO I HAD TAKES A MUCH

01:46:15.069 --> 01:46:18.806 region:rollup2
BROADER VIEW AND ACTUALLY LEADS

01:46:16.637 --> 01:46:21.208 region:rollup2
WITH A STORY FROM ANZ IN OUR.

01:46:18.806 --> 01:46:23.244 region:rollup2
ABOUT A MAN WHO CAME OUT THERE

01:46:21.208 --> 01:46:24.745 region:rollup2
TOO HE DIDN'T HAVE ANY BIRTH

01:46:23.244 --> 01:46:27.214 region:rollup2
RECORDS AND HE.

01:46:24.745 --> 01:46:28.482 region:rollup2
HAD AN EXPERIENCE OF GOING AND

01:46:27.214 --> 01:46:30.451 region:rollup2
ENGAGING WITH A GRADUATE STUDENT

01:46:28.482 --> 01:46:33.220 region:rollup2
ARQUEBUS THERE WHO IS ABLE TO

01:46:30.451 --> 01:46:36.290 region:rollup2
FIND WITHIN THE CAMP NEWSPAPER

01:46:33.220 --> 01:46:38.392 region:rollup2
THE VERY FIRST. TIME HE'D EVER

01:46:36.290 --> 01:46:40.294 region:rollup2
SEEN ANY RECOGNITION. THAT HE

01:46:38.392 --> 01:46:42.663 region:rollup2
KIND OF SPUR STARTED TO EXIST IN

01:46:40.294 --> 01:46:44.098 region:rollup2
PRINT AND JAM BUT ONE OF THE

01:46:42.663 --> 01:46:46.066 region:rollup2
REASONS THAT THAT STORY LEADS

01:46:44.098 --> 01:46:47.835 region:rollup2
THE BOOK IS FRANKLY A LOT OF

01:46:46.066 --> 01:46:49.136 region:rollup2
CULTURAL INSTITUTIONS ARE DYING

01:46:47.835 --> 01:46:50.804 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THERE'S A PERCEPTION

01:46:49.136 --> 01:46:52.539 region:rollup2
THAT WHAT'S HAPPENING BEHIND THE

01:46:50.804 --> 01:46:54.074 region:rollup2
SCENES IN THE ARCHIVE. ISN'T

01:46:52.539 --> 01:46:55.376 region:rollup2
RELEVANT TO EVERYBODY AND I

01:46:54.074 --> 01:46:57.378 region:rollup2
THINK AS WE'RE HEARING FROM ALL

01:46:55.376 --> 01:46:59.313 region:rollup2
OF THIS TESTIMONY TODAY. IT IS

01:46:57.378 --> 01:47:00.447 region:rollup2
RELEVANT BUT IT TAKES THESE

01:46:59.313 --> 01:47:02.816 region:rollup2
BRIDGE BUILDING AN AMPLIFICATION

01:47:00.447 --> 01:47:04.318 region:rollup2
PROJECTS TO CHANGE THE SENSE OF

01:47:02.816 --> 01:47:06.587 region:rollup2
IT DUSTY BOOKS IN A ROOM

01:47:04.318 --> 01:47:07.721 region:rollup2
SOMEWHERE TO THIS IS LIVING

SO WITH THE PURPOSE OF

01:55:30.157 --> 01:55:33.160 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING WHETHER THEIR

01:55:31.825 --> 01:55:34.427 region:rollup2
EQUITY ISSUES IN PARTICULAR

01:55:39.633 --> 01:55:43.937 region:rollup2
SLOT.

01:55:42.202 --> 01:55:45.872 region:rollup2

SMALLEST HIGH SCHOOLS SO YOU CAN

01:55:50.710 --> 01:55:53.480 region:rollup2
SEE IF YOU LOOK AT THE ENGLISH

01:55:51.812 --> 01:55:55.549 region:rollup2
LANGUAGE ARTS WE DIVIDED THE

01:55:53.480 --> 01:55:58.151 region:rollup2
SCHOOLS INTO. INTO COURT TRIALS

01:55:55.549 --> 01:55:58.852 region:rollup2
BY SIZE SO THE LITTLEST SCHOOLS

01:55:58.151 --> 01:56:00.086 region:rollup2
ARE IN BLUE AND THE LARGEST

01:55:58.852 --> 01:56:01.555 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS

HIGH SCHOOL THEN AND THAT'S NOT

01:56:07.627 --> 01:56:10.030 region:rollup2

VARIETY OF COURSE WORK BUT IT IS

01:56:12.866 --> 01:56:15.435 region:rollup2
A QUESTION THAT WE GOT SO I

01:56:14.201 --> 01:56:17.337 region:rollup2
WANTED TO PUT THAT OUT IN FRONT

01:56:15.435 --> 01:56:18.638 region:rollup2
THAT. YES IN FACT THERE'S MORE

01:56:17.337 --> 01:56:19.673 region:rollup2
VARIETY IN THEM THOUGH THAT

01:56:18.638 --> 01:56:21.942 region:rollup2

SO HERE IS REALLY THE MAIN

01:56:29.483 --> 01:56:32.485 region:rollup2
FINDING WHAT WE ENDED UP DOING

SEE. I THINK THAT NUMBER IS

01:57:56.636 --> 01:57:59.372 region:rollup2
TWENTY EIGHT.

01:57:57.470 --> 01:58:00.807 region:rollup2

ANOTHER BIG.

01:58:17.057 --> 01:58:19.192 region:rollup2
GAP AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE

01:58:18.224 --> 01:58:20.293 region:rollup2
SEE IN OUR HIGH POVERTY

01:58:19.192 --> 01:58:21.995 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES THEY JUST DON'T HAVE

01:58:20.293 --> 01:58:22.596 region:rollup2
THOSE KINDS OF CORPORATE COURSE

01:58:21.995 --> 01:58:24.097 region:rollup2
OFFERINGS AT THE MIDDLE SCHOOL

REQUIREMENTS.

01:58:29.202 --> 01:58:32.706 region:rollup2
SO THIS GRAPH IS FOCUSED ON

01:58:30.403 --> 01:58:33.640 region:rollup2
STUDENT ENROLLMENT AND OF COURSE

01:58:32.706 --> 01:58:34.274 region:rollup2
ONLY A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF

STUDENTS.

01:58:34.274 --> 01:58:38.111 region:rollup2

ADVANCED COURSES IN PARTICULAR

01:58:38.111 --> 01:58:40.714 region:rollup2
SO WHAT YOU CAN SEE ALTHOUGH THE

01:58:39.212 --> 01:58:42.048 region:rollup2
NUMBERS ARE LOW ACROSS THE BOARD

01:58:40.714 --> 01:58:43.683 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF THE PERCENTAGE OF

01:58:42.048 --> 01:58:45.452 region:rollup2
STUDENTS THAT. THAT ENROLL IN AN

01:58:43.683 --> 01:58:47.220 region:rollup2
ADVANCED COURSES YOU CAN STILL

TWENTY PERCENT NEARLY TWENTY

01:58:48.488 --> 01:58:53.293 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF STUDENTS IN.

01:58:51.591 --> 01:58:54.427 region:rollup2
HI PART IN AND LOW POVERTY MORE

01:58:53.293 --> 01:58:55.829 region:rollup2
AFFLUENT HIGH SCHOOLS IN

01:58:54.427 --> 01:58:56.796 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA ARE ENROLLED IN AN

01:58:55.829 --> 01:58:58.598 region:rollup2
ADVANCED HISTORY OR SOCIAL

01:58:56.796 --> 01:58:59.933 region:rollup2
SCIENCE COURSE VERSUS ONLY TEN

01:58:58.598 --> 01:59:02.202 region:rollup2
PERCENT AND OUR HIGHER PROPERT

01:58:59.933 --> 01:59:04.137 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY. YOU SEE THE SAME GAP

01:59:02.202 --> 01:59:06.206 region:rollup2
IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE. AND YOU SEE

01:59:04.137 --> 01:59:06.773 region:rollup2
SOMEONE OF A GAP IN ENGLISH

01:59:06.206 --> 01:59:09.376 region:rollup2
ELEVEN PERCENT VERSUS EIGHT

01:59:06.773 --> 01:59:10.777 region:rollup2
PERCENT.

01:59:09.376 --> 01:59:12.245 region:rollup2
AND THEN FINALLY WE LOOKED AT

01:59:10.777 --> 01:59:13.947 region:rollup2
GENDER ISSUES IN TERMS OF

01:59:12.245 --> 01:59:15.115 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATION AND ADVANCED

01:59:13.947 --> 01:59:16.483 region:rollup2
HUMANITIES COURSE AND WE SEE

01:59:15.115 --> 01:59:17.717 region:rollup2
THAT THE MAJORITY OF STUDENTS

01:59:16.483 --> 01:59:19.419 region:rollup2
THAT ARE ENROLLED IN ADVANCE

01:59:17.717 --> 01:59:22.822 region:rollup2
HUMANITIES. COURSES IN HIGH

01:59:19.419 --> 01:59:25.091 region:rollup2
SCHOOL OUR GIRLS YOUNG WOMEN SO

01:59:22.822 --> 01:59:26.626 region:rollup2
IT'S ABOUT SIXTY FORTY IN TERMS

01:59:25.091 --> 01:59:28.194 region:rollup2
OF THAT PARTICIPATION IN THESE

01:59:26.626 --> 01:59:29.462 region:rollup2
ADVANCED HUMANITIES COURSES. SO

01:59:28.194 --> 01:59:30.830 region:rollup2
I IMAGINE IF WE HAD A SLIDE

01:59:29.462 --> 01:59:32.465 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT STEM COURSES IT MIGHT

01:59:30.830 --> 01:59:32.766 region:rollup2
LOOK IT MIGHT LOOK GOOD.

01:59:32.465 --> 01:59:35.535 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT.

01:59:32.766 --> 01:59:36.703 region:rollup2
WE DIDN'T LOOK AT THAT BUT.

01:59:35.535 --> 01:59:39.606 region:rollup2
WE WERE SOMEWHAT SURPRISED TO

01:59:36.703 --> 01:59:46.713 region:rollup2
SEE THAT GENDER DISPARITY THERE.

01:59:39.606 --> 01:59:49.115 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT'S ALL I HAVE.

01:59:46.713 --> 01:59:50.684 region:rollup2
NOW I'M NOT I MEAN YOU'RE YOU'RE

01:59:49.115 --> 01:59:50.984 region:rollup2

OF OUR COOKING IN THE POVERTY

01:59:57.390 --> 02:00:00.593 region:rollup2
ISSUE SO. NOW THINKING ABOUT IT

01:59:59.559 --> 02:00:00.794 region:rollup2
I GUESS IT'S NOT TOO SURPRISING

02:00:00.593 --> 02:00:02.996 region:rollup2
BUT.

02:00:00.794 --> 02:00:05.031 region:rollup2
I DO WONDER IF WE WOULD SEE THE

02:00:02.996 --> 02:00:06.332 region:rollup2
SAME KIND OF DIFFERENCE IF

02:00:05.031 --> 02:00:08.334 region:rollup2

ZERO OUT THE BUDGETING BUT TERMS

02:11:16.635 --> 02:11:19.038 region:rollup2

WITH AN INSTANCE LIKE YOURS HAS

02:11:21.841 --> 02:11:25.911 region:rollup2
THAT BEEN PRETTY STEADY FROM

02:11:23.409 --> 02:11:28.013 region:rollup2
BEFORE THE. THE THE CHANGEOVER

02:11:25.911 --> 02:11:29.382 region:rollup2
TO NOW YEN IN JUST TO PUT SOME

02:11:28.013 --> 02:11:30.816 region:rollup2
HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE AND IS

02:11:29.382 --> 02:11:32.551 region:rollup2
WELL THERE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN.

02:11:30.816 --> 02:11:34.019 region:rollup2
OVERTIME QUESTIONS OF WHETHER TO

02:11:32.551 --> 02:11:35.588 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THESE

02:11:34.019 --> 02:11:37.490 region:rollup2
CULTURAL AGENCIES AT THE FEDERAL

02:11:35.588 --> 02:11:39.225 region:rollup2
LEVEL THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME

02:11:37.490 --> 02:11:39.892 region:rollup2
THAT THIS HAS HAPPENED. AND SO I

02:11:39.225 --> 02:11:41.293 region:rollup2
THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE

02:11:39.892 --> 02:11:42.094 region:rollup2
ALWAYS PREPARED FOR WHICH IS ONE

02:11:41.293 --> 02:11:43.129 region:rollup2
OF THE REASONS THAT WE'RE ALWAYS

02:11:42.094 --> 02:11:44.764 region:rollup2
LOOKING FOR OTHER SOURCES OF

02:11:43.129 --> 02:11:45.965 region:rollup2
FUNDING BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT AT

02:11:44.764 --> 02:11:48.434 region:rollup2
SOME POINT MAYBE IT WILL HAPPEN.

02:11:45.965 --> 02:11:49.535 region:rollup2
AND WHAT WE'VE REALLY BEEN PROUD

02:11:48.434 --> 02:11:50.403 region:rollup2
OF OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE

02:11:49.535 --> 02:11:51.771 region:rollup2
NATIONAL ANTHEM FOR THE

02:11:50.403 --> 02:11:53.439 region:rollup2
HUMANITIES WE THINK IT'S REALLY

02:11:51.771 --> 02:11:55.608 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT TO HAVE. A PUBLIC

02:11:53.439 --> 02:11:56.709 region:rollup2
PRIVATE APPROACH TO THE WORK

02:11:55.608 --> 02:12:00.880 region:rollup2
THAT WE'RE DOING IT IN THE

02:11:56.709 --> 02:12:01.614 region:rollup2
SUPPORT THAT WE RECEIVE AND WE

02:12:00.880 --> 02:12:02.948 region:rollup2
ARE ARE.

02:12:01.614 --> 02:12:04.183 region:rollup2
VERY PROUD TO BE PART OF SUCH A

02:12:02.948 --> 02:12:06.385 region:rollup2
LARGE COALITION.

02:12:04.183 --> 02:12:08.220 region:rollup2
I THINK THERE'S A CRITICAL MASS

02:12:06.385 --> 02:12:09.722 region:rollup2
OF HUMANITY'S WORK THAT'S BEEN

02:12:08.220 --> 02:12:10.756 region:rollup2
DOING BUT HAPPENING AT THE THE

02:12:09.722 --> 02:12:13.025 region:rollup2
FEDERAL LEVEL AND AT THE STATE

02:12:10.756 --> 02:12:14.727 region:rollup2
LEVEL ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND YOU

02:12:13.025 --> 02:12:16.595 region:rollup2

MONEY COMES TO GRANTEES FROM THE

02:12:16.595 --> 02:12:19.365 region:rollup2
ANY H. DIRECTLY IS ALSO

02:12:18.497 --> 02:12:20.666 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT WE THINK IS

02:12:19.365 --> 02:12:22.368 region:rollup2
REALLY WONDERFUL IT'S IT'S

02:12:20.666 --> 02:12:24.236 region:rollup2
MULTIPLE WAYS OF SUPPORTING
