SOME SITUATIONS WHERE WE CAN

00:28:33.278 --> 00:28:34.913
HAVE SOMEONE TO SORT OF WAVE AND

00:28:34.979 --> 00:28:37.082

00:34:05.143 --> 00:34:06.911
LEGISLATION AND I THINK WE ALL

00:34:06.978 --> 00:34:09.580
ACKNOWLEDGE. THE SEVERITY OF OUR

00:34:09.647 --> 00:34:11.549
WORKFORCE CRISIS ESPECIALLY AS

00:34:11.616 --> 00:34:14.585
IT RELATES TO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH-

00:34:14.652 --> 00:34:16.654
I HAD MY STUFF LOOK REAL QUIK

00:34:16.721 --> 00:34:18.723
AT ABOUT THAT ISSUE DID THE BBS

00:34:18.790 --> 00:34:22.193
IS VERY DIFFICULT TO WORK WITH

00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:24.195
AND- I'VE ALSO. IN ADDITION

00:34:24.262 --> 00:34:26.697
SENATOR TRY TO MY TIME BOTH THE

00:34:26.764 --> 00:34:28.166
ON BMP. TO DO SOME OF THESE WORK

00:34:28.232 --> 00:34:30.101
FORCE ISSUES AND- AND SCOPE

00:34:30.168 --> 00:34:31.068
ISSUES ARE DIFFICULT AND

00:34:31.135 --> 00:34:32.603
HOPEFULLY THIS HOPEFULLY THE

00:34:32.670 --> 00:34:34.439
CRISIS IS SUCH THAT WE CAN ALL.

00:34:34.505 --> 00:34:36.908
DECIDE TO WORK COLLABORATIVELY

00:34:36.974 --> 00:34:38.509
TOGETHER TO TAKE CAR OF THIS.

00:34:38.576 --> 00:34:40.745
AND I THINK I THINK BELIEVE THIS

00:34:40.812 --> 00:34:41.846
IS DOUBLE REFERRED BECAUSE I.

00:34:41.913 --> 00:34:43.848
ONE OF MY ISSUES IS ALSO MORE%

00:34:43.915 --> 00:34:44.482
AROUND THE EDUCATIONAL COMPONENT

00:34:44.549 --> 00:34:48.352
OF IT- ESPECIALLY FOR SOCIAL

00:34:48.419 --> 00:34:49.854
WORK WE HAVE A- A NATIONAL. TO

00:34:49.921 --> 00:34:52.056
EVERY EVERY SCHOOL WAIT WHEN MSW

00:34:52.123 --> 00:34:54.492
IS MORE VALUABLE SOMEONE SAY.

00:34:54.559 --> 00:34:55.560
THE OTHER DEGREES BECAUSE OF

00:34:55.626 --> 00:34:56.727
YOUR DEGREE IN COUNSELING

00:34:56.794 --> 00:34:58.496
SOMETHING ELSE NO ONE KNOWS WHAT

00:34:58.563 --> 00:34:59.964
THAT IS. IF YOU GET AN MSW THAT

00:35:00.031 --> 00:35:00.998
AROUND THE WORLD PEOPLE KNOW

00:35:01.065 --> 00:35:02.200
WHAT THAT IS AND THERE'S

00:35:02.266 --> 00:35:03.634
ESTABLISH CRITERIA NO MATTER

00:35:03.701 --> 00:35:05.236
WHAT STATE YOU'RE IN IF YOU'RE

00:35:05.303 --> 00:35:06.838
IN. YOUR EUROPE. OR FEAR IN.

00:35:06.904 --> 00:35:09.841
MINNESOTA OR CALIFORNIA. THERE'S

00:35:09.907 --> 00:35:11.008
A CERTAIN CRITERIA THAT MUST BE

00:35:11.075 --> 00:35:12.310
MET BE A LICENSED. OR

00:35:12.376 --> 00:35:14.212
ACCREDITED. PROGRAM SO THERE

00:35:14.278 --> 00:35:16.214
SHOULDN'T BE ANY ISSUES WITH.

00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:19.650
PORTABILITY ACROSS. THE STATE

00:35:19.717 --> 00:35:21.285
SET THERE IS- BUT ONE OF THE

00:35:21.352 --> 00:35:23.287
THINGS I THINK WE REALLY NEED TO

00:35:23.354 --> 00:35:25.890
FOCUS ON. IS THIS ISSUE OF OUR

00:35:25.957 --> 00:35:27.258
POLICIES PUSHING FOR MORE

00:35:27.325 --> 00:35:28.926
CALIFORNIA STUDENTS IN OUR

00:35:28.993 --> 00:35:29.894
CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS WHICH IS

00:35:29.961 --> 00:35:31.295
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT BUT I

00:35:31.362 --> 00:35:32.897
BELIEVE WHAT HAS HAPPENED IS A

00:35:32.964 --> 00:35:34.899
LOT OF OUR GRADUATE PROGRAMS

00:35:34.966 --> 00:35:37.268
HAVE REDUCED BECAUSE THEY'RE

00:35:37.335 --> 00:35:39.670
MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE TO ADMIT.

00:35:39.737 --> 00:35:40.738
AND OUR BACHELOR'S PROGRAM SOME

00:35:40.805 --> 00:35:43.674
GROUND. WHICH ISN'T MUCH LESS

00:35:43.741 --> 00:35:47.411
EXPENSIVE SO. IN MY IN MY SMALL

00:35:47.478 --> 00:35:49.213
AMOUNT OF RESEARCH I'VE DONE ON

00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:51.015
IT SCHOOL THAT USED TO ADMIT

00:35:51.082 --> 00:35:54.252
COHORTS OF THREE HUNDRED MSW ARE

00:35:54.318 --> 00:35:56.254
NOW ADMITTING COURTS ONE HUNDRED

00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:57.255
. BASHERS PROGRAMS HAVE TRIPLED

00:35:57.321 --> 00:35:59.023
IN SIZES AND SO THEN YOU HAVE

00:35:59.090 --> 00:36:00.124
ALL THESE BACHELORS LEVEL PEOPLE

00:36:00.191 --> 00:36:01.926
WHO DON'T HAVE A MASTER'S DEGREE

00:36:01.993 --> 00:36:04.395
PROGRAM TO GO TO. AND THEY END

00:36:04.462 --> 00:36:06.130
UP GOING SOMEWHERE ONLINE PAYING

00:36:06.197 --> 00:36:07.665
A LOT OF MONEY GETTING INTO

00:36:07.732 --> 00:36:09.600
OFTENTIMES AND NOT BEING ABLE TO

00:36:09.667 --> 00:36:12.036
GET THEIR LICENSE. AND CREATING

00:36:12.103 --> 00:36:14.238
A LOT MORE ISSUES SO IT REALLY I

00:36:14.305 --> 00:36:16.073
THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME

00:36:16.140 --> 00:36:17.041
COORDINATION BETWEEN THE C.

00:36:17.108 --> 00:36:19.076
ISSUES IN THE UC'S. ON THE SLOTS

00:36:19.143 --> 00:36:21.879
THAT ARE GOING TO BE AVAILABLE

00:36:21.946 --> 00:36:23.481
FOR THE STUDENTS. THANK YOU IF I

00:36:23.548 --> 00:36:26.050
COULD JUST SAY- YOU KNOW CENTER

00:36:26.117 --> 00:36:28.352
A MAN SPECIFIC ON HIS BILL TO I

00:36:28.419 --> 00:36:29.921
KNOW IT'S ALSO BUDGET ISSUE. IF

00:36:29.987 --> 00:36:32.390
THERE ARE SPECIFIC THOUGHTS YOU

00:36:32.456 --> 00:36:33.791
HAVE ABOUT HOW WE CAN STRENGTHEN

00:36:33.858 --> 00:36:35.393
THE INTENT OF THIS BILL IS THAT

00:36:35.459 --> 00:36:37.895
MORE M. S. W.'S- BUT IF THEY'RE

00:36:37.962 --> 00:36:40.064
WAYS WE CAN STRENGTHEN THE IN

00:36:40.131 --> 00:36:40.898
THE BILL WE REALLY WALK. YOUR

00:36:40.965 --> 00:36:43.067
THE SPACE FOR ONE OF THE THINGS

00:36:43.134 --> 00:36:45.503
THAT WE ALWAYS NEED IN ORDER FOR

00:36:45.570 --> 00:36:46.571
SOMEONE TO GET LICENSE THEY HAVE

00:36:46.637 --> 00:36:47.705
TO HAVE POSTGRADUATE. SUPERVISED

00:36:47.772 --> 00:36:49.273
HOURS. AND SO THAT IS ONE OF THE

00:36:49.340 --> 00:36:51.108
ISSUES OF A LOT OF NONPROFITS

00:36:51.175 --> 00:36:52.076

01:54:36.903 --> 01:54:38.571
THERE ARE A LOT OF PARENTS

01:54:38.638 --> 01:54:40.106
AROUND THIS COUNTRY MAYBE AROUND

01:54:40.173 --> 01:54:43.243
THE WORLD WHO ARE. UNFAIRLY

01:54:43.309 --> 01:54:46.079
TERRORIZED- BY CERTAIN REPORTS

01:54:46.145 --> 01:54:48.681
ABOUT WHAT LONG COVE IT IS WHAT

01:54:48.748 --> 01:54:51.017
IT REPRESENTS. AND I THINK MANY

01:54:51.084 --> 01:54:53.553
PEOPLE WHO HAVE CHOSEN TO TAKE

01:54:53.620 --> 01:54:54.420
THE VACCINE AND PROTECT

01:54:54.487 --> 01:54:56.656
THEMSELVES OR LOW RISK OR HAVE

01:54:56.723 --> 01:54:58.591
PRIOR INFECTION ARE STILL

01:54:58.658 --> 01:55:00.326
CONCERNED ABOUT THIS POSSIBILITY

01:55:00.393 --> 01:55:01.527
AND I THINK IT'S GOOD PUBLIC

01:55:01.594 --> 01:55:03.796
HEALTH COMMUNICATION TO FOCUS ON

01:55:03.863 --> 01:55:05.832
THE DATA. AND FOCUS ON NOT

01:55:05.898 --> 01:55:07.934
SCARING PEOPLE THAT REASSURING

01:55:08.001 --> 01:55:09.035
THEM WITH REASSURING DATA WE

01:55:09.102 --> 01:55:12.272
HAVE AND- NOW I CAN GO TO THE

01:55:12.338 --> 01:55:13.973
LIST BUT THERE LARGE DATASETS

01:55:14.040 --> 01:55:15.875
FROM DENMARK ENGLAND- THE

01:55:15.942 --> 01:55:18.845
NETHERLANDS FRANCE THAT

01:55:18.911 --> 01:55:20.380
BASICALLY SHOW FOR THE LARGE

01:55:20.446 --> 01:55:22.215
PART. DIMS RESOLVE- FOR PEOPLE

01:55:22.282 --> 01:55:23.516
WHO HAVE SYMPTOMS THE SYMPTOMS

01:55:23.583 --> 01:55:25.518
THAT ARE MOST CONSISTENTLY SEEN.

01:55:25.585 --> 01:55:26.753
THAT ARE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT

01:55:26.819 --> 01:55:28.187
TO CONTROL GROUPS AND CONTROL

01:55:28.254 --> 01:55:29.255
GROUPS THAT NEVER TESTED

01:55:29.322 --> 01:55:30.690
POSITIVE FOR SARS COMMITTEE

01:55:30.757 --> 01:55:32.025
MEETING NEVER TESTED POSITIVE

01:55:32.091 --> 01:55:33.926
FOR COVE IT. IS ANOSMIA MEANING

01:55:33.993 --> 01:55:35.662
LACK OF SMALL WHICH CAN PERSIST

01:55:35.728 --> 01:55:36.963
FOR A FEW MONTHS AND WE KNOW

01:55:37.030 --> 01:55:38.164
THAT'S BECAUSE THE VIRUS TARGETS

01:55:38.231 --> 01:55:40.133
SOME OF THOSE RECEPTORS. BUT

01:55:40.199 --> 01:55:41.934
EVEN THAT RESOLVES. AND IT'S

01:55:42.001 --> 01:55:44.871
VERY REASSURING AND WHAT'S MORE

01:55:44.937 --> 01:55:45.805
IMPORTANT IS THAT. YOU KNOW

01:55:45.872 --> 01:55:47.340
SINCE TWENTY TWENTY WE'VE HAD.

01:55:47.407 --> 01:55:48.941
MENDIS AWARENESS OF VIRAL

01:55:49.008 --> 01:55:50.910
ILLNESS AS IF IT WASN'T PRESENT.

01:55:50.977 --> 01:55:53.079
PRIOR TO TWENTY TWENTY UNIT HAS

01:55:53.146 --> 01:55:54.747
BEEN AND WE HAVE SOME VERY GOOD

01:55:54.814 --> 01:55:57.083
DATA FROM- THE OTHER ONES IN

01:55:57.150 --> 01:55:59.452
PARTICULAR WAVE MIND ELECTRONIC

01:55:59.519 --> 01:56:00.853
HEALTH RECORD DATA TO LOOK AT.

01:56:00.920 --> 01:56:01.821
WHAT IS THE PERSISTENCE OF

01:56:01.888 --> 01:56:03.956
SYMPTOMS AFTER WALKER IDEA VIRAL

01:56:04.023 --> 01:56:05.191
ILLNESSES THAT WE FACE ALL THE

01:56:05.258 --> 01:56:07.627
TIME SUCH AS INFLUENZA. AND IT'S

01:56:07.694 --> 01:56:09.128
ABOUT THE SAME. AND THEY LOOKED

01:56:09.195 --> 01:56:10.596
AT OVER EIGHTY MILLION

01:56:10.663 --> 01:56:11.831
ELECTRONIC RECORDS AND THEY

01:56:11.898 --> 01:56:13.733

01:57:04.984 --> 01:57:06.152
STUDY SURVEY THAT WAS BROUGHT

SOMETHING I'D LIKE YOU TO DO AS

01:57:08.988 --> 01:57:10.923
WELL. I DO- YOU KNOW I THINK ONE

01:57:10.990 --> 01:57:12.925
OF THE POINTS I WAS TRYING TO

01:57:12.992 --> 01:57:14.694
MAKE IS IF YOU LOOK AT THE

01:57:14.761 --> 01:57:15.795
PERFORMANCE OF THESE TESTS EVEN

01:57:15.862 --> 01:57:16.796
MANAGING TEST WHICH HONESTLY

01:57:16.863 --> 01:57:18.231
GOOD LET HOME ALTERNATIVE RATHER

01:57:18.297 --> 01:57:19.232
THAN PCR WHICH CAN BE OVERLY

01:57:19.298 --> 01:57:21.067
SENSITIVE. IS THAT. GIVEN THE

01:57:21.134 --> 01:57:22.068
PERFORMANCE STATISTICS AND WE

01:57:22.135 --> 01:57:24.537
CAN GO THROUGH WHAT I MEAN BY

01:57:24.604 --> 01:57:25.638
THAT. I THINK THAT'S YOU KNOW

01:57:25.705 --> 01:57:26.639
GETTING THE WEEDS. BUT

01:57:26.706 --> 01:57:28.074
CALIFORNIA HAD BASICALLY SEVEN

01:57:28.141 --> 01:57:31.511
WEEKS WITHIN THE LAST FIFTY TWO

01:57:31.577 --> 01:57:34.614
WEEKS WERE FALSE POSITIVES WOULD

01:57:34.680 --> 01:57:35.848
HAVE BEEN LOWER THAN TRUE

01:57:35.915 --> 01:57:37.750
POSITIVES MEANING FALSE POSITIVE

01:57:37.817 --> 01:57:39.652
WOULD BE SITUATIONS WHERE

01:57:39.719 --> 01:57:40.453
CHILDREN OTHER PEOPLE WOULD BE

01:57:40.520 --> 01:57:43.456
SENT HOME. UNNECESSARILY EVEN

01:57:43.523 --> 01:57:44.524
THOUGH THEY WERE NOT TRULY

01:57:44.590 --> 01:57:47.427
INFECTED. AND THAT PERIOD OF

01:57:47.493 --> 01:57:49.395
TIME WAS ROUGHLY AROUND DECEMBER

01:57:49.462 --> 01:57:50.830
TWENTY SECOND I THINK YOU

01:57:50.897 --> 01:57:52.598
FEBRUARY SEVENTH I HAVE IN MY

01:57:52.665 --> 01:57:53.499
NOTES. BUT THAT'S THE ONLY

01:57:53.566 --> 01:57:55.268
PERIOD OF TIME WHERE THE TRUE

01:57:55.334 --> 01:57:56.602
POSITIVES WITH X. WOULD HAVE

01:57:56.669 --> 01:57:58.404
EXCEEDED THE INAPPROPRIATE

01:57:58.471 --> 01:58:00.940
POSITIVE SO TO SPEAK. AND IN THE

01:58:01.007 --> 01:58:04.777
STUDY CITED- BY- SOME OF THE

01:58:04.844 --> 01:58:06.345
PROPONENTS OF THIS BILL. THEY'RE

01:58:06.412 --> 01:58:09.782
TESTING POSITIVITY RATE WAS ZERO

01:58:09.849 --> 01:58:12.351
POINT 1% I TOLD YOU THIS WOULD

01:58:12.418 --> 01:58:15.421
BREAK IT 7% SEVEN AND A HALF

01:58:15.488 --> 01:58:17.890
ACTUALLY. TO BUY THEIR- OWN

01:58:17.957 --> 01:58:21.794
SURVEY. A SEVEN HUNDRED AND 50%

01:58:21.861 --> 01:58:24.864
DIFFERENTIAL OF FALSE POSITIVES

01:58:24.931 --> 01:58:27.099
TO TRUE POSITIVES WOULD HAVE

01:58:27.166 --> 01:58:28.734
BEEN PRESENT BY THEIR OWN DATA

01:58:28.801 --> 01:58:30.770
NOW THAT'S OFTEN FEBRUARY TWENTY

01:58:30.837 --> 01:58:31.871
TWENTY ONE BY THE WAY IT'S NOT

01:58:31.938 --> 01:58:33.172
EVEN CURRENT WITH OMICRON WHICH

01:58:33.239 --> 01:58:35.074
IS A VERY DIFFERENT SITUATION.

01:58:35.141 --> 01:58:37.109
AS ABOUT 50% OF CALIFORNIAN

01:58:37.176 --> 01:58:38.578
HOUSEHOLDS FOUND OUT IN THOSE

01:58:38.644 --> 01:58:40.179
FOSTER POSITIVES WOULD REQUIRE

01:58:40.246 --> 01:58:41.814
KIDS TO BE OUT OF SCHOOL FOR IT

01:58:41.881 --> 01:58:44.817
THAT'S CORRECT HAND YOU KNOW THE

01:58:44.884 --> 01:58:46.118
I THINK WAS MS VASES DAVE I'M

01:58:46.185 --> 01:58:48.120
SORRY SHE'S A PHYSICIAN I DON'T

01:58:48.187 --> 01:58:49.789

BROUGHT UP. SOMETHING ABOUT THE

01:58:51.657 --> 01:58:52.258
BERKELEY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT

01:58:52.325 --> 01:58:54.827
IN RAVENS WHAT I MEAN I PRACTICE

01:58:54.894 --> 01:58:56.562
IN A HOSPITAL THAT'S RECEIVING

01:58:56.629 --> 01:58:57.396
FACILITY FOR MANY PATIENTS FROM

01:58:57.463 --> 01:58:58.564
RAVENS WITH. SO WHATEVER TESTING

01:58:58.631 --> 01:59:00.466
WAS DONE THERE THAT HELPED THEM

01:59:00.533 --> 01:59:01.801
GET ACCESS THAT'S WONDERFUL BUT

01:59:01.868 --> 01:59:04.103
I SAW A LOT OF FAMILIES IN THE

01:59:04.170 --> 01:59:05.505

02:07:00.546 --> 02:07:02.147
IT'S TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE

02:07:02.214 --> 02:07:04.616
PLANS IN PLACE FOR PUBLIC HEALTH

02:07:04.683 --> 02:07:06.352
. SO OUR PUBLIC EDUCATION

02:07:06.418 --> 02:07:08.754
SYSTEMS CAN STAY OPEN. I CAN USE

02:07:08.821 --> 02:07:10.689
CAN YOU SPEAK TO THAT FOR ME.

02:07:10.756 --> 02:07:11.957
THANK YOU CENTER EGGMAN FOR THAT

02:07:12.024 --> 02:07:12.791
QUESTION REALLY APPRECIATE

02:07:12.858 --> 02:07:13.993
THAT'S BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S A

02:07:14.059 --> 02:07:15.794
LOT BEING SAID ABOUT THE BILL

02:07:15.861 --> 02:07:17.463
THAT ISN'T ACTUALLY IN THE BILL.

02:07:17.529 --> 02:07:18.998
SO WHAT THE BILL CALLS FOR IS

02:07:19.064 --> 02:07:20.933
THE COST FOR. EACH SCHOOL

02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:22.835
DISTRICT AND OTHER ELECTRICAL

02:07:22.901 --> 02:07:24.103
PRODUCTS OVER TO HAVE A TESTING

02:07:24.169 --> 02:07:27.306
PLAN AND ACTUALLY- WORK WITH THE

02:07:27.373 --> 02:07:29.174
PUBLIC HEALTH WHICH BY THE WAY

02:07:29.241 --> 02:07:30.876
WILL BE PROVIDING. ADVICE

02:07:30.943 --> 02:07:33.445
SUPPORT RIGHT HE SAID- WE WANTS-

02:07:33.512 --> 02:07:34.646
DEFINING SUPPORTIVE SERVICES

02:07:34.713 --> 02:07:37.349
INCLUDING TAX ASSISTANCE.

02:07:37.416 --> 02:07:39.351
SUPPORT GUIDANCE MONITORING

02:07:39.418 --> 02:07:45.491
EVALUATION. XIN SO THE IDEA IS

02:07:45.557 --> 02:07:46.725
THAT AND ALSO IT'S- DEPENDING ON

02:07:46.792 --> 02:07:48.293
GOING ON IN THE APARTMENT SO

02:07:48.360 --> 02:07:49.895
BRING NOW WE'RE LOW BIT A LOT

02:07:49.962 --> 02:07:51.830
FOR HALF WE DON'T NEED TO TEST

02:07:51.897 --> 02:07:53.132
THIS MUCH WHEN THE CASE. GO UP.

02:07:53.198 --> 02:07:54.900
WE NEED TO MORE BECAUSE ULTIMATE

02:07:54.967 --> 02:07:56.201
WE WANT TO KEEP. KIDS SAFE IN

02:07:56.268 --> 02:07:58.737
SCHOOL IT ALSO PARENTS WANT TO

02:07:58.804 --> 02:08:00.472
KNOW. I MEAN THINK ABOUT IT THIS

02:08:00.539 --> 02:08:02.708
I MEAN I HAVE CHILDREN IN SCHOOL

02:08:02.775 --> 02:08:04.076
MANY OF YOU HAVE CHILDREN IN

02:08:04.143 --> 02:08:05.177
SCHOOL- YOU'RE READY GAME THAT

02:08:05.244 --> 02:08:06.578
NO SAYING SOMEONE IN THIS CLASS

02:08:06.645 --> 02:08:09.314
HAD HEAD LICE RIGHT- BECAUSE

02:08:09.381 --> 02:08:11.383
PARENTS WANT TO KNOW NOW HEAD

02:08:11.450 --> 02:08:14.253
LICE IS A DEADLY DISEASE. BUT

02:08:14.319 --> 02:08:15.287
YEAH SO WHAT'S AND- IS THAT

02:08:15.354 --> 02:08:16.855
THERE ARE FAMILIES- THEIR

02:08:16.922 --> 02:08:18.590
CHILDREN IN SCHOOL WHO ARE MORE

02:08:18.657 --> 02:08:20.225
VULNERABLE TO THE DISEASE. MAY

02:08:20.292 --> 02:08:22.127
HAVE DIABETES ASTHMA OTHER

02:08:22.194 --> 02:08:24.363
CONDITIONS. THEY MAY HAVE THEY

02:08:24.430 --> 02:08:26.165
THEY MAY BE GOING HOME TO A

02:08:26.231 --> 02:08:29.134
HOUSEHOLD. AND SO WHERE SOMEONE

02:08:29.201 --> 02:08:30.936
MAY BE AT HIGH RISK OF COVERAGE.

02:08:31.003 --> 02:08:32.971
SO AGAIN. THIS IS ABOUT

02:08:33.038 --> 02:08:34.706
TRANSPARENCY FOR PARENTS THOSE

02:08:34.773 --> 02:08:36.442
TWO BECAUSE PARENTS DON'T WANT

02:08:36.508 --> 02:08:38.977
THEIR POWER IN FACT. AND KNOW

02:08:39.044 --> 02:08:41.180
ABOUT IT. HOME AND THE

02:08:41.246 --> 02:08:42.381
POTENTIALLY PUT SOMEONE ELSE IN

02:08:42.448 --> 02:08:45.017
DANGER SO. HELPS ENSURE THAT.

02:08:45.084 --> 02:08:48.554
APPLICANTS CAN FORM. CASE THEIR

02:08:48.620 --> 02:08:50.489
CHOPS SPOKE. TESTING ALLOWS US

02:08:50.556 --> 02:08:51.924
TO KNOW WHERE WE'RE GOING. AND

02:08:51.990 --> 02:08:53.625
IN TERMS OF THE DISEASE

02:08:53.692 --> 02:08:55.027
OUTBREAKS SCHOOL BECAUSE WHAT WE

02:08:55.094 --> 02:08:56.562
DON'T WANT TO DO IS. WITHOUT

EVEN A NEW PROGRAM THAT IS

02:10:59.384 --> 02:11:01.119
SOMETHING THAT'S ALREADY BEEN

02:11:01.186 --> 02:11:02.221

AT ALL IN THAT PLAN. TO BE

02:12:21.900 --> 02:12:23.669
CONSISTENT WITH THE CALIFORNIA

02:12:23.735 --> 02:12:24.936
DEPARTMENT OF THE HEALTH

OF BEING ABLE TO IMPLEMENT THAT

02:12:38.216 --> 02:12:40.485
PLAN SO IF THE CALIFORNIA

02:12:40.552 --> 02:12:42.120
DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CAN

02:12:42.187 --> 02:12:44.489
ANALYZING RECESSING THE CURRENT

02:12:44.556 --> 02:12:50.028
IN THIS CASE COVERT. NINETEEN

02:12:50.095 --> 02:12:50.962
RATE LEVEL WHATEVER THAT. HEALTH

02:12:51.029 --> 02:12:52.731
RELATED TO IS. DETERMINES THAT

02:12:52.798 --> 02:12:55.901
NO TESTING. IS REQUIRED IN THE

02:12:55.967 --> 02:12:57.969
K. THROUGH TWELVE OPERATION IN

CALIFORNIA. DOES THAT MEAN A LOT

02:13:00.372 --> 02:13:04.376
OF- LOCAL EDUCATIONAL THIRTY A

02:13:04.443 --> 02:13:05.444
SCHOOL DISTRICT WOULD NOT HAVE

02:13:05.510 --> 02:13:07.746
TO- MINUTES TESTING PLAN. YES IF

02:13:07.813 --> 02:13:09.514
WE IF THAT TURNS OUT WE ARE ABLE

02:13:09.581 --> 02:13:11.350
TO GET THE CASE RATE OF COATED

02:13:11.416 --> 02:13:14.553
LOW ENOUGH- THEN- TESTING MAY BE

02:13:14.619 --> 02:13:16.688
UNNECESSARY AND- THAT'S- AND

02:13:16.755 --> 02:13:18.090
THAT MAY BE THE RECOMMENDATION

02:13:18.156 --> 02:13:19.725
CORRECT AND THAT'S WITHIN THE

02:13:19.791 --> 02:13:21.660
PURVIEW OF THE- CALIFORNIA

02:13:21.727 --> 02:13:23.762
DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. NOT

02:13:23.829 --> 02:13:27.132
THIS LEGISLATIVE BODY THAT'S

02:13:27.199 --> 02:13:30.102
CORRECT YES THANK YOU. OKAY I

02:13:30.168 --> 02:13:31.837
THINK THAT'S EVERYONE NOW SO IT

02:13:31.903 --> 02:13:38.677
IS MY TURN- SO IT LOOKS TO ME AS

02:13:38.744 --> 02:13:41.046
THOUGH IT DOES. THE BILL DOES

02:13:41.113 --> 02:13:43.014
REQUIRE THAT A PLAN IS IN PLACE

02:13:43.081 --> 02:13:53.358
AND THAT TESTING- TAKE PLACE SO. OKAY CALIFORNIA NATIONWIDE.

02:13:53.425 --> 02:13:57.062
AND I THINK WE HAVE 12% OF THE

02:13:57.129 --> 02:13:59.998
STUDENTS IN THE COUNTRY AND WE

02:14:00.065 --> 02:14:04.136
ONLY HAD 1% OF A SCHOOL CLOSURES

02:14:04.202 --> 02:14:07.272
BECAUSE OF COPING. SO THAT SEEMS

02:14:07.339 --> 02:14:08.707
A BIT DISPROPORTIONATE AND I

02:14:08.774 --> 02:14:10.942
THINK WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IN THE

02:14:11.009 --> 02:14:14.413
DATA HAS SHOWN THAT- THESE HOME

02:14:14.479 --> 02:14:18.116
TESTS. AREN'T ALWAYS- AS

02:14:18.183 --> 02:14:20.218
EFFECTIVE AS WE WOULD LIKE AND I

02:14:20.285 --> 02:14:21.720
HAVE A PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WITH

02:14:21.787 --> 02:14:23.455
THAT AS DO OTHER MEMBERS OF MY

02:14:23.522 --> 02:14:27.392
FAMILY- THE HOME TESTS JUST.

02:14:27.459 --> 02:14:28.827
THEY'RE JUST NOT AS EFFECTIVE

02:14:28.894 --> 02:14:31.696
YOU CAN HAVE CODED AND THEN YOU

02:14:31.763 --> 02:14:33.899
KNOW IT DOESN'T SHOW POSITIVE

02:14:33.965 --> 02:14:35.867
FOR FIVE DAYS SO. REALLY WHAT

02:14:35.934 --> 02:14:38.003
ARE WE MITIGATING IF A STUDENT

02:14:38.069 --> 02:14:40.238
STATE TEST NEGATIVE- BUT

02:14:40.305 --> 02:14:42.340
ACTUALLY HAS COVE AND INCOMES TO

02:14:42.407 --> 02:14:45.110
SCHOOL ANYWAY- NOT TO MENTION

02:14:45.177 --> 02:14:48.280
THE FACT THAT. THE FOCUS IS ON

02:14:48.346 --> 02:14:50.148
ON KIDS FOR TESTING THEM BUT

02:14:50.215 --> 02:14:52.350
WHAT WE'RE NOT TAKING INTO

02:14:52.417 --> 02:14:54.519
ACCOUNT HIS. THE OTHER MEMBERS

02:14:54.586 --> 02:14:55.787
OF THEIR FAMILY THEIR PARENTS

02:14:55.854 --> 02:14:57.456
ARE PERHAPS THEIR OLDER SIBLINGS

02:14:57.522 --> 02:14:58.423
OR GRANDPARENTS TO LIVE WITH

02:14:58.490 --> 02:15:00.992
THEM WHO ARE GOING OUT IN IN

02:15:01.059 --> 02:15:02.561
BEING IN A PUBLIC SETTING AND

02:15:02.627 --> 02:15:04.062
PERHAPS YOU KNOW THEY'RE

02:15:04.129 --> 02:15:05.630
BRINGING AND HOW WE'D I DON'T

02:15:05.697 --> 02:15:08.567
THINK THAT WE CAN PINPOINT- THAT

02:15:08.633 --> 02:15:11.870
THAT. INFECTION NECESSARILY TOOK

02:15:11.937 --> 02:15:13.004
PLACE AT THE SCHOOL NOT TO

02:15:13.071 --> 02:15:15.574
MENTION. AS SYMPTOMATIC TESTING

02:15:15.640 --> 02:15:19.678
OF STUDENTS. WE HAVE SEEN JUST.

02:15:19.744 --> 02:15:21.379
REALLY DOESN'T PROVIDE ANY

02:15:21.446 --> 02:15:25.817
MITIGATING EFFECT I MEAN THAT'S

02:15:25.884 --> 02:15:31.756
THAT'S DATA WE HAVE. THE- ON

02:15:31.823 --> 02:15:38.163
HERE. OKAY SO THE- THERE IS A

02:15:38.230 --> 02:15:39.831
COMPANY THE COLOR COMPANY I

02:15:39.898 --> 02:15:42.133
THINK IT'S CALLED THEY DID A

02:15:42.200 --> 02:15:42.701
HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND

02:15:42.767 --> 02:15:43.768
RAPID TEST MUCH LIKE THE ONES

02:15:43.835 --> 02:15:45.704
THAT WE TAKE LEGISLATORS EVERY

02:15:45.770 --> 02:15:47.772
SUNDAY BEFORE WE COME UP HERE TO

02:15:47.839 --> 02:15:49.007
SACRAMENTO AND THEN WE TAKE

02:15:49.074 --> 02:15:50.942
ANOTHER ONE- ON WEDNESDAYS THEY

02:15:51.009 --> 02:15:53.144
DID HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND OF

02:15:53.211 --> 02:15:56.381
THESE RAPID TESTS- ONLY SIX

02:15:56.448 --> 02:15:57.349
HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE OF

02:15:57.415 --> 02:15:59.084
THOSE ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY

02:15:59.150 --> 02:16:01.286
THOUSAND TEST- SIX HUNDRED

02:16:01.353 --> 02:16:02.921
TWENTY THREE OF THEM SHOWED

02:16:02.988 --> 02:16:05.757
POSITIVE. OF THE 600-233-0080

02:16:05.824 --> 02:16:07.526
FIVE OF THEM ONE SEEDED A

02:16:07.592 --> 02:16:09.160
FURTHER PCR TEST WHICH IS THE

02:16:09.227 --> 02:16:12.297
GOLD STANDARD ONLY THREE HUNDRED

02:16:12.364 --> 02:16:14.199
EIGHTY FIVE OF THEM- I'M SORRY

02:16:14.266 --> 02:16:15.367
EXCUSE ME THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY

02:16:15.433 --> 02:16:16.868
FIVE OF THEM TURNED OUT TO BE

02:16:16.935 --> 02:16:18.770
NEGATIVE THEY DIDN'T HAVE

02:16:18.837 --> 02:16:21.006
COVERAGE. SO I MEAN THAT'S NOT

02:16:21.072 --> 02:16:22.073
HYPERBOLE THAT'S JUST THE FACT

02:16:22.140 --> 02:16:24.109
THAT THESE TESTS ARE JUST NOT

02:16:24.175 --> 02:16:27.045
1100% ACTIVE- ACCURATE. IN THE

02:16:27.112 --> 02:16:28.313
ANALYSIS THAT'S OUT THERE

02:16:28.380 --> 02:16:30.282
SUGGEST THAT THESE TESTS ARE

02:16:30.348 --> 02:16:32.150
MISSING ABOUT A THIRD OF THOSE

02:16:32.217 --> 02:16:33.919
WHO ARE INFECTED WITH THIS VIRUS

02:16:33.985 --> 02:16:35.887
IN KIDS AT THIRD SO WHAT'S

02:16:35.954 --> 02:16:37.989
HAPPENING IS AND I'VE SEEN IN MY

02:16:38.056 --> 02:16:41.426
OWN KIDS- SCHOOLS BECAUSE I DO

02:16:41.493 --> 02:16:42.427
STILL HAVE CHILDREN IN SCHOOL

02:16:42.494 --> 02:16:44.696
MYSELF. OR MY OWN CHILD GOT SENT

02:16:44.763 --> 02:16:48.767
HOME BECAUSE HE COST IT'S COOL.

02:16:48.833 --> 02:16:51.202
LEADING TO A TEST AND SO HE HAD

02:16:51.269 --> 02:16:51.970
A QUARANTINE AND THEN THERE WERE

02:16:52.037 --> 02:16:53.939
SOMEONE ELSE AT SCHOOL HAD

02:16:54.005 --> 02:16:54.873
QUARANTINE. BECAUSE THERE IS A

02:16:54.940 --> 02:16:56.374
POSITIVE TEST IN TURNS OUT THAT

02:16:56.441 --> 02:16:58.243
STUDENT DID NOT HAVE CODED SO

02:16:58.310 --> 02:17:00.545
NOW THEY'VE MISSED EVEN MORE

02:17:00.612 --> 02:17:03.782
INSTRUCTION AND TO ME IT'S- TO

02:17:03.848 --> 02:17:05.216
THE POINT F ABSURDITY NOW WHAT

02:17:05.283 --> 02:17:06.685
WE'RE DOING TODAY IS TO THESE

02:17:06.751 --> 02:17:08.820
KIDS YOU CANNOT KEEP REMOVING

02:17:08.887 --> 02:17:10.121
THEM FROM THE CLASSROOM

02:17:10.188 --> 02:17:11.623
ENVIRONMENT AFTER WHERE HE DID

02:17:11.690 --> 02:17:12.958
THAT TO THEM FOR MORE THAN A

02:17:13.024 --> 02:17:16.294
YEAR AND EXPECT THEM TO BE

02:17:16.361 --> 02:17:17.762
LEARNING IN A WAY THAT'S GOING

02:17:17.829 --> 02:17:19.197
TO HELP THEM SUCCEED AND THRIVE

02:17:19.264 --> 02:17:21.132
AND BE ABLE TO PASS THE TESTING

02:17:21.199 --> 02:17:22.367
GOING TO WHATEVER IT IS THEY

02:17:22.434 --> 02:17:27.505
GOING TO AFTER HIGH SCHOOL- IT.

02:17:27.572 --> 02:17:29.107
YOU KNOW I GET IT WE ALL WANT TO

02:17:29.174 --> 02:17:31.710
BE SAFE FROM CALVIN WE DO BUT

02:17:31.776 --> 02:17:33.979
IT'S THIS OBSESSION WITH

02:17:34.045 --> 02:17:36.348
FOCUSING ON KIDS I JUST THINK

02:17:36.414 --> 02:17:43.188
NEEDS TO STOP- NOT TO MENTION. I

02:17:43.254 --> 02:17:45.590
GUESS THE ONE THING WE DIDN'T

02:17:45.657 --> 02:17:47.058
TALK ABOUT WAS. YOU KNOW WHEN

02:17:47.125 --> 02:17:49.260
THESE KIDS ARE REMOVED FROM THE

02:17:49.327 --> 02:17:51.296
SCHOOL BECAUSE THEY HAVE TESTED

02:17:51.363 --> 02:17:53.098
POSITIVE IN MAYBE IT'S A FALSE

02:17:53.164 --> 02:17:54.733
POSITIVE MAYBE IT'S AN ACTUAL

02:17:54.799 --> 02:17:56.434
POSITIVE OR THEY'VE BEEN EXPOSED

02:17:56.501 --> 02:17:57.869
TO SOMEBODY IN THE CLASSROOM AND

02:17:57.936 --> 02:18:00.138
SO THEY DECIDE THIS. JOHN HAS TO

02:18:00.205 --> 02:18:02.340
QUARANTINE. WHY IS THERE NO

02:18:02.407 --> 02:18:04.442
FOCUSED ON WHAT THAT CHILD IS

02:18:04.509 --> 02:18:06.678
DOING WHEN THEY'RE NOT IN THE

02:18:06.745 --> 02:18:09.481
CLASSROOM. BECAUSE THEIR PARENTS

02:18:09.547 --> 02:18:13.451
ARE PROBABLY HOPEFULLY WORKING-

02:18:13.518 --> 02:18:14.986
WHY NO FOCUS ON THAT WHAT'S

02:18:15.053 --> 02:18:16.187
HAPPENING WITH THAT CHILD

02:18:16.254 --> 02:18:18.590
BECAUSE WE HAVE SEEN THE DAMAGE

02:18:18.657 --> 02:18:19.557
THAT HAS BEEN DONE

02:18:19.624 --> 02:18:22.027
PSYCHOLOGICALLY TO THESE KIDS

02:18:22.093 --> 02:18:23.862
FROM BEING PULLED OUT OF THEIR

02:18:23.928 --> 02:18:28.633
CLASSROOMS FOR MORE THAN A YEAR

02:18:28.700 --> 02:18:29.934
COMPUTER. THE DAMAGES THAT WE

02:18:30.001 --> 02:18:31.403
JUST HAD A BILL TALKING ABOUT

02:18:31.469 --> 02:18:33.171
THE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUE AND

02:18:33.238 --> 02:18:35.006
WANTING TO HAVE MORE FUNDING FOR

02:18:35.073 --> 02:18:36.741
WE CANNOT IGNORE WHAT HAPPENS

02:18:36.808 --> 02:18:39.177
WHEN WE KEEP THIS SYSTEM IN

02:18:39.244 --> 02:18:41.546
PLACE. OF BEING ABLE TO REMOVE

02:18:41.613 --> 02:18:43.948
KIDS FROM THE CLASSROOM. WITH

02:18:44.015 --> 02:18:47.919
KEVIN TESTING AND NOT TALK ABOUT

02:18:47.986 --> 02:18:54.259
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU DO THAT- I. I'M SORRY I CANNOT SUPPORT

02:18:54.325 --> 02:18:56.895
THIS BILL TODAY AND I DEEPLY

02:18:56.961 --> 02:19:00.832
RESPECT- THE INTENT. BEHIND

02:19:00.899 --> 02:19:02.133
TRYING TO KEEP EVERYBODY SAFE

02:19:02.200 --> 02:19:04.169
BUT THIS BILL JUST IT DOESN'T DO

02:19:04.235 --> 02:19:05.937
THAT AND I WISH THAT WE COULD

02:19:06.004 --> 02:19:07.505
STOP WITH THIS OBSESSION OF

02:19:07.572 --> 02:19:09.641
GOING AFTER KIDS WHO CAN'T STAND

02:19:09.708 --> 02:19:11.776
UP FOR THEMSELVES BECAUSE THEIR

02:19:11.843 --> 02:19:14.479
KIDS WELL THAT'S WHAT I WAS

02:19:14.546 --> 02:19:15.113
PERRANCE HERS. AND THAT'S WHAT

02:19:15.180 --> 02:19:17.348
I'M GOING TO DO SO RESPECTFULLY-

02:19:17.415 --> 02:19:19.150
I CANNOT VOTE FOR THIS BILL SO

02:19:19.217 --> 02:19:20.852

ROUGHLY ZERO I'VE HEARD THE

02:19:26.925 --> 02:19:28.993
STATEMENT THAT THE BILL REQUIRES

02:19:29.060 --> 02:19:30.628
TESTING AND- YOU KNOW MAYBE.

02:19:30.695 --> 02:19:32.497
MAYBE THAT'S ONE INTERPRETATION

02:19:32.564 --> 02:19:34.365
OF ITBUT YOU KNOW BEING. THE

02:19:34.432 --> 02:19:36.801
FORMER LAWYER THAT I AM I HAVE

02:19:36.868 --> 02:19:41.039
TO READ. THE LANGUAGE OF THIS

02:19:41.106 --> 02:19:42.107
BILL SIMPLY SAYS THE STATE

02:19:42.173 --> 02:19:43.274

SHALL ADMINISTER A TESTING

02:19:51.583 --> 02:19:53.952
PROGRAM SO THAT MAY REQUIRE.

02:19:54.018 --> 02:19:55.653
SOME LEVEL OF TESTING WE CLEAR

02:19:55.720 --> 02:19:57.589
OTHERWISE OR MAY NOT DEPENDING

02:19:57.655 --> 02:19:59.657
ON THE GUIDANCE ISSUED BY THE-

02:19:59.724 --> 02:20:01.025
CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH

02:20:01.092 --> 02:20:03.461
I JUST THINK WE OUGHTA WELL MAKE

02:20:03.528 --> 02:20:05.897

TESTING PROGRAM PURSUANT TO A

02:20:18.843 --> 02:20:22.480
PLAN. MAY REQUIRE TESTING TO

02:20:22.547 --> 02:20:23.748
DEPENDING ON WHAT THE DEPARTMENT

PUBLIC HEALTH SAYS FOR THE CDC

02:20:26.251 --> 02:20:28.153
OR IT MAY NOT SO I THINK WE

02:20:28.219 --> 02:20:30.155
OUGHT TO. JUST MAKE SURE WE KNOW

02:20:30.221 --> 02:20:32.056

OF ALL- TESTING RECOMMENDATIONS

02:22:33.211 --> 02:22:35.146
DEPENDS ON LOCAL CIRCUMSTANCES

02:22:35.213 --> 02:22:36.147
SO THERE'S A KIND OF A

02:22:36.214 --> 02:22:38.349
CONSISTENCY WELL BECAUSE OF CFC

02:22:38.416 --> 02:22:39.884

THE MORE CERVANTES THINK IF THAT

02:23:19.991 --> 02:23:21.392
GOES DOWN. SO AND PERHAPS EVEN

02:23:21.459 --> 02:23:22.927

02:23:33.338 --> 02:23:35.073
IS I DIDN'T I'M NOT TRYING TO.

02:23:35.139 --> 02:23:36.374
THERE'S NOTHING IN THE

02:23:36.441 --> 02:23:37.642
LEGISLATION SO THAT LEGISLATORS

02:23:37.709 --> 02:23:38.443

02:23:38.509 --> 02:23:40.244
LAW IN THE CODE TESTING PLANS

02:23:40.311 --> 02:23:42.347

02:23:42.413 --> 02:23:44.782
THE FARM PUBLIC HEALTH ON THAT-

02:23:44.849 --> 02:23:49.587
I. ALSO WANT NOTE- THE TERM OF

02:23:49.654 --> 02:23:51.122
THAT YOU KNOW WE DON'T WANT TO

02:23:51.189 --> 02:23:52.957
SPEAK. FROM SCHOOLS. RIGHT AND I

02:23:53.024 --> 02:23:54.826
DON'T KEEP IN MIND THAT THERE

02:23:54.892 --> 02:23:55.994
ARE CHILDREN WHO ARE CURRENTLY

02:23:56.060 --> 02:23:57.395
NOT ATTENDING SCHOOL BECAUSE

02:23:57.462 --> 02:23:58.129
THEIR PARENTS ARE WORRIED THAT

02:23:58.196 --> 02:23:59.530
THE SCHOOLS THEMSELVES AND NOT

02:23:59.597 --> 02:24:00.898
SAFE ENOUGH FOR THEIR CHILD.

02:24:00.965 --> 02:24:01.866
THEY'RE WORRIED THEIR CHILD'S

WE NEED TO LISTEN TO THOSE

02:24:18.483 --> 02:24:20.051
PARENTS. AS WELL BECAUSE THEY'RE

02:24:20.118 --> 02:24:20.952

02:25:05.496 --> 02:25:06.197
CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES- WASN'T

THAT WE NEED THIS EVEN MORE

02:53:51.420 --> 02:53:52.221

LOOKING AT LIKE TIME FOR ALL THE

02:53:54.357 --> 02:53:55.158
PLACEMENT HOW LONG DOES THAT

02:53:55.224 --> 02:53:57.126
TAKE HOW LONG SOMEBODY WAITING

02:53:57.193 --> 02:53:58.094
IN AN EMERGENCY ROOM AND THEN

02:53:58.161 --> 02:53:59.862
WHAT PART OF THE STATE IS THAT

02:53:59.929 --> 02:54:01.097
HAPPENING AND WHERE IT'S NOT

02:54:01.164 --> 02:54:02.465
BECAUSE THAT WILL TELL US ABOUT

02:54:02.532 --> 02:54:04.133
RESOURCES. SINCE THE PLACEMENT

02:54:04.200 --> 02:54:06.903

02:54:11.307 --> 02:54:12.141
FOUR COUNTIES OVER. HUGE

02:54:12.208 --> 02:54:13.910
PROBLEMS RIGHT AND THEN WE CAN

02:54:13.976 --> 02:54:15.478
BETTER DIRECT OUR INFRASTRUCTURE

02:54:15.545 --> 02:54:16.546
DOLLARS. THAT WE'RE ALSO

02:54:16.612 --> 02:54:17.680
CURRENTLY HAVING BILLIONS GO

02:54:17.747 --> 02:54:20.516

WORK FOR A LONG TIME. IT IS IT

02:54:41.470 --> 02:54:44.040
IN MY MIND- OUTRAGEOUS THAT

02:54:44.106 --> 02:54:45.208
WE'RE STILL USING THE SAME

02:54:45.274 --> 02:54:46.843
TECHNOLOGY AND HAVE THE SAME

02:54:46.909 --> 02:54:48.678

THE SOFTWARE EXIST THOUGH IT

02:55:21.544 --> 02:55:23.880
COULD BE IMPROVED IS THAT A

02:55:23.946 --> 02:55:25.715
