00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:36.495

INTERFERE IN ANY SIGNIFICANT WAY

00:11:39.632 --> 00:11:40.199

00:11:49.975 --> 00:11:51.210
I THINK THERE'S A FISCAL

00:11:51.277 --> 00:11:53.012
ARGUMENT HERE ABOUT THE AMOUNT

00:11:53.079 --> 00:11:54.280
OF MONEY THAT WE SPEND MAKING

00:11:54.346 --> 00:11:55.548
THAT COUNTACCURATE BECAUSE

00:11:55.614 --> 00:11:57.450
OBVIOUSLY ONE OF OUR INCENTIVES

00:11:57.516 --> 00:11:58.851
FOR MAKING SURE THAT EVERY

00:11:58.918 --> 00:11:59.685
CALIFORNIA GETS COUNTED IS THAT

00:11:59.752 --> 00:12:01.821
WE GET A DECADE WORTH OF FEDERAL

00:12:01.887 --> 00:12:03.422
REVENUE THAT'S BASED ON THOSE

00:12:03.489 --> 00:12:04.223
COUNTS SO.

00:12:04.290 --> 00:12:06.158
A QUESTION FOR THE LA -- HAVE WE

00:12:06.225 --> 00:12:09.061
DONE AN ANALYSIS ON HOW MUCH

00:12:09.128 --> 00:12:10.396
FEDERAL FUNDING IS AT STAKE.

00:12:10.463 --> 00:12:11.464
I'M JUST WONDERING ABOUT THE

00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:12.898
TRADE OFFS BECAUSE I KNOW THAT

00:12:12.965 --> 00:12:15.101
EVEN UNDER THE ADMINISTRATION'S

00:12:15.167 --> 00:12:17.436
PROPOSAL HERE WERE -- PROPOSING

00:12:17.503 --> 00:12:19.105
TO SPEND SUBSTANTIALLY MORE

00:12:19.171 --> 00:12:20.940
MONEY THAN ANY OTHER STATE HAS

00:12:21.006 --> 00:12:22.274
DONE.

00:12:22.341 --> 00:12:23.375
YEAH WE ACTUALLY HAVE DONE AN

00:12:23.442 --> 00:12:24.944
ANALYSIS OF THE AMOUNT OF

00:12:25.010 --> 00:12:27.947
FEDERAL FUNDING AT STAKE -- SO

00:12:28.013 --> 00:12:29.682
IN CONTRAST TO PRIOR STUDIES

00:12:29.748 --> 00:12:30.983
THAT HAVE FOUND THAT POTENTIALLY

00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:32.351
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS WOULD BE ON

00:12:32.418 --> 00:12:33.252
THE LINE.

00:12:33.319 --> 00:12:34.820
OUR ESTIMATE IS THAT WOULD BE IT

00:12:34.887 --> 00:12:36.455

00:12:36.522 --> 00:12:39.058

00:12:39.658 --> 00:12:41.827
MILLIONS.

00:12:41.894 --> 00:12:42.895
THE IS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE

00:12:42.962 --> 00:12:45.831
DELTA BETWEEN DOING NOTHING.

00:12:45.898 --> 00:12:47.233
DOING NO WAY OUT REACH AND THE

00:12:47.299 --> 00:12:48.767
DELL AND SPENDING YOU KNOW

00:12:48.834 --> 00:12:49.702
WHAT'S CONSIDERED TO BE THE

00:12:49.768 --> 00:12:52.638
MAXIMUM OUT OF OUR REACH.

00:12:52.705 --> 00:12:54.540
NO -- SO.

00:12:54.607 --> 00:12:55.541
IT'S A LITTLE BIT IT'S A LITTLE

00:12:55.608 --> 00:12:56.842
BIT NUANCED IN THE CONTEXT OF

00:12:56.909 --> 00:12:59.812
THE OUTRAGE RIGHT SO THIS IS

00:12:59.879 --> 00:13:00.913
ACTUALLY THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN.

00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:02.348
WHAT OUR ESTIMATE OF WHAT THE

00:13:02.414 --> 00:13:04.116
STATE WOULD RECEIVE AND FEDERAL

00:13:04.183 --> 00:13:05.117
FUNDING IF THERE WAS AN

00:13:05.184 --> 00:13:07.620
UNDERCOUNT SIMILAR TO THE ONE IN

00:13:07.686 --> 00:13:08.420
NINETEEN NINETY WHICH IS THE

00:13:08.487 --> 00:13:09.221
LARGEST ON ACCOUNT THAT THE

00:13:09.288 --> 00:13:12.358
STATE HAS EXPERIENCED IN -- A

00:13:12.424 --> 00:13:13.692
FEW DECADES SO THE DELTA BETWEEN

00:13:13.759 --> 00:13:15.494
WHAT WE WOULD EXPERIENCE IN

00:13:15.561 --> 00:13:17.163
NINETEEN NINETY VERSES IF YOU

00:13:17.229 --> 00:13:18.797
KNOW THE THE COW WERE.

00:13:18.864 --> 00:13:20.432
IN OUR VIEW SORT OF REASONABLY

00:13:20.499 --> 00:13:23.102
ACCURATE AND COMPLETE -- IS THAT

00:13:23.169 --> 00:13:24.136
FEW HUNDRED MILLION OF COURSE

00:13:24.203 --> 00:13:24.703
AND THERE'S THIS SORT OF

00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:26.172
ADDITIONAL QUESTION OF WHAT IS

00:13:26.238 --> 00:13:27.506
THE MARGINAL VALUE OF ADDITIONAL

00:13:27.573 --> 00:13:29.842
OUT REACH -- AND SO YOU KNOW

00:13:29.909 --> 00:13:31.777
THERE'S NO GUARANTEE NECESSARILY

00:13:31.844 --> 00:13:33.212
THAT ADDITIONAL FUNDING IS GOING

00:13:33.279 --> 00:13:34.613
TO GET YOU A PERFECTLY COMPLETE

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:36.048
COUNT SO THAT WOULD BE.

00:13:36.115 --> 00:13:38.417
A DIFFERENT ANALYSIS OKAY SO.

00:13:38.484 --> 00:13:39.451
I'M I'M UNDERSTANDING WHAT

00:13:39.518 --> 00:13:41.253
YOU'RE SAYING SO IF WHAT WHAT

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:42.988
LEVEL WOULD YOU RECOMMEND IS

00:13:43.055 --> 00:13:44.590
BEING YOU KNOW -- SUPPORTED BY

00:13:44.657 --> 00:13:45.925
THE FISCAL DATA AND LIKE -- YOU

00:13:45.991 --> 00:13:49.195
KNOW OUR EVERY DOLLAR THAT WE

00:13:49.261 --> 00:13:49.828
SPEND DEALS MORE THAN A DOLLAR

00:13:49.895 --> 00:13:52.131
IN -- IN FUTURE FEDERAL BENEFITS

00:13:52.198 --> 00:13:53.532
DISCOUNTED FOR THE CURRENT VALUE

00:13:53.599 --> 00:13:54.800
BUT WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE

00:13:54.867 --> 00:13:56.669
THAT THE CENSUS ISN'T ONLY

00:13:56.735 --> 00:13:57.970
IMPORTANT BECAUSE OF THE FEDERAL.

00:13:58.037 --> 00:13:58.737
LAND RIGHT REALIZE THE

00:13:58.804 --> 00:14:00.272
REPRESENTATION ISSUE -- THERE'S

00:14:00.339 --> 00:14:01.941
ALSO JUST HAVING ACCURATE AND

00:14:02.007 --> 00:14:03.509
COMPLETE DATA FOR THE STATE TO

00:14:03.576 --> 00:14:05.044
BE ABLE TO EVALUATE ITS POLICY

00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:07.179
DECISIONS -- HAVING ACCURATE AND

00:14:07.246 --> 00:14:09.348
COMPLETE DATA FOR STATE MONEY TO

00:14:09.415 --> 00:14:10.549
TRAVEL TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

00:14:10.616 --> 00:14:11.817
THAT'S A PIECEOF THE ANALYSIS

00:14:11.884 --> 00:14:12.985
THAT WE NEVER COVERED.

00:14:13.052 --> 00:14:14.453
SO THERE IS YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:16.655
MULTIPLE FACETS OF THIS AND THAT

00:14:16.722 --> 00:14:18.157
FEDERAL FUNDING IS REALLY ONLY

00:14:18.224 --> 00:14:23.329
ONE SMALL PIECE -- I THINK.

00:14:23.395 --> 00:14:24.263
OF THAT ANSWER THE QUESTION.

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:25.197
BUT IT ARE YOU ARE YOU ASKING

00:14:25.264 --> 00:14:26.799
FOR LIKE A A DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR

00:14:26.865 --> 00:14:29.301
COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS RETURN ON

00:14:29.368 --> 00:14:29.902
GROW JUST JUST FOR THE FEDERAL

00:14:29.969 --> 00:14:31.437
FUNDING JUST WONDERING AT WHAT

00:14:31.503 --> 00:14:32.972
LEVEL DOES THIS EFFORT PAY FOR

00:14:33.038 --> 00:14:34.440
ITSELF AND OBVIOUSLY THERE'S

00:14:34.506 --> 00:14:36.575
GOING TO BE A A LEVEL AT WHICH

00:14:36.642 --> 00:14:36.742
IT.

00:14:36.809 --> 00:14:38.210
IT STOPS PAYING FOR ITSELF AND

00:14:38.277 --> 00:14:39.078
THE ONLY REASON TO SPEND MORE

00:14:39.144 --> 00:14:40.412
THAN THAT WOULD BE THE OTHER

00:14:40.479 --> 00:14:41.480
REPRESENTATIVE ARGUMENTS THAT

00:14:41.547 --> 00:14:42.581
YOU MADE RIGHT RIGHT SO

00:14:42.648 --> 00:14:44.316
ABSOLUTELY AND AND THE QUESTION

00:14:44.383 --> 00:14:45.751
ACTUALLY COMES DOWN TO WHAT IS

00:14:45.818 --> 00:14:48.020
THE MARGINAL AFFECT OF AN

00:14:48.087 --> 00:14:48.621
ADDITIONAL DOLLAR ABOUT REACH

00:14:48.687 --> 00:14:49.021
RIGHT.

00:14:49.088 --> 00:14:50.489
HOW MANY PEOPLE DO WE COUNT WITH

00:14:50.556 --> 00:14:52.057
AN ADDITIONAL DOLLAR HOURS --

00:14:52.124 --> 00:14:53.325
HONESTLY I THINK THAT THAT

00:14:53.392 --> 00:14:54.493
QUESTION IS NOT ANSWERABLE FROM

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:55.794
OUR ANALYSIS PERSPECTIVE AND

00:14:55.861 --> 00:14:57.162
IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WE WE

00:14:57.229 --> 00:14:58.998
NECESSARILY WOULD BE ABLE TO

00:14:59.064 --> 00:14:59.665
ANSWER WITH ADDITIONAL ANALYSIS

00:14:59.732 --> 00:15:00.232
REALLY.

00:15:00.299 --> 00:15:01.100
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD

00:15:01.166 --> 00:15:03.002
ASK COMPLETE COUNT TO BE ABLE TO

00:15:03.068 --> 00:15:05.371
RESPOND TO I'M SORRY YOUR ASKED.

00:15:05.437 --> 00:15:06.472
TO COMPLETE COUNT.

00:15:06.538 --> 00:15:08.440
THE ODD THE AGENCY THAT'S IN

00:15:08.507 --> 00:15:12.344
CHARGE OF DOING OUTRAGE IS

00:15:12.411 --> 00:15:14.780
MISSING OKAY THANK YOU

00:15:14.847 --> 00:15:15.080
[inaudible]

00:15:15.147 --> 00:15:17.783
MR ROTH.

00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:18.250
HAVE TO FIGURE OUT THE

00:15:18.317 --> 00:15:18.651
MICROPHONE.

00:15:18.717 --> 00:15:19.885
THE TENS OF MILLIONS TO HUNDREDS

00:15:19.952 --> 00:15:21.754
OF MILLIONS IS THAT A YEAR OR IS

00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:23.088
OUT OF THE DECADE.

00:15:23.155 --> 00:15:24.223
THAT IS A YEAR BUT IT OULD

00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:26.392
DECLINE OVER THE DECADE BECAUSE

00:15:26.458 --> 00:15:28.060
A LOT OF WHAT BUT OUR RESEARCH

00:15:28.127 --> 00:15:29.528
SUGGESTED WAS THAT A LOT OF

00:15:29.595 --> 00:15:30.696
PROGRAMS WHILE THEY'RE NOT BASED

00:15:30.763 --> 00:15:32.464
ON THE DECENNIAL CENSUS.

00:15:32.531 --> 00:15:33.599
IN THE YEAR THAT THE CENSUS

00:15:33.666 --> 00:15:35.167
OCCURRED SO SAY IN TWENTY TWENTY

00:15:35.234 --> 00:15:36.402
AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE A LOT OF

00:15:36.468 --> 00:15:37.870
FEDERAL FUNDING FORMULAS WILL BE

00:15:37.936 --> 00:15:38.737
BASED ON THAT TWENTY TWENTY

00:15:38.804 --> 00:15:39.672
CENSUS

00:15:39.738 --> 00:15:41.340
BUT THERE AFTER -- THEIR

00:15:41.407 --> 00:15:42.975
FORMULAS WILL USUALLY RELY ON

00:15:43.042 --> 00:15:44.777
THE ANNUAL POPULATION COUNTS

00:15:44.843 --> 00:15:46.211
WHICH ARE BASED ON SURVEYS.

00:15:46.278 --> 00:15:47.913
BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- SO

00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:50.449
THE ANNUAL HOUSING SURVEY OR THE

00:15:50.516 --> 00:15:53.352
COMMUNITY POPULATION SURVEY AND

00:15:53.419 --> 00:15:55.154
THE AND THE AFFECTS OF THE

00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:56.355
UNDERCOUNT WOULD SOLELY A ROAD

00:15:56.422 --> 00:15:57.923
OVER TIME AS BIG AS THE ACTUAL

00:15:57.990 --> 00:15:59.458
DECENNIAL CENSUS IS NO LONGER

00:15:59.525 --> 00:16:02.161
USED AS PART OF THOSE FUNDING

00:16:02.227 --> 00:16:03.362
FORMULAS.

00:16:03.429 --> 00:16:04.430
SO TENS OF MILLIONS TO HUNDREDS

00:16:04.496 --> 00:16:05.297
OF MILLIONS.

00:16:05.364 --> 00:16:07.499
A YEAR DECLINING OVER THE DECADE

00:16:07.566 --> 00:16:09.301
THAT THE CENSUS COVERS THAT'S

00:16:09.368 --> 00:16:10.869
RIGHT.

00:16:10.936 --> 00:16:11.670
I'M SURE YOU SAID THIS AND I

00:16:11.737 --> 00:16:12.971
MISSED IT BECAUSE I WAS IN AND

00:16:13.038 --> 00:16:14.540
OUT BUT WHAT'S THE TOTAL AMOUNT

00:16:14.606 --> 00:16:16.809
THAT'S PROJECTED TO BE SPENT BY

00:16:16.875 --> 00:16:17.876
THE STATE ON THE CENSUS EFFORT.

00:16:17.943 --> 00:16:19.345
A HUNDRED AND FIFTY SEVEN

00:16:19.411 --> 00:16:20.713
MILLION INCLUDING THE GOVERNOR'S

00:16:20.779 --> 00:16:23.949
PROPOSAL IT WOULD BE CLOSER TO

00:16:24.016 --> 00:16:24.550
TWO HUNDRED MILLION UNDER THE

00:16:24.616 --> 00:16:25.184
HOUSES.

00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:26.552
THANK YOU THINK YOU MANAGER

00:16:26.618 --> 00:16:27.820
THANK YOU.

00:16:27.886 --> 00:16:30.856
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS SIR MORE

00:16:30.923 --> 00:16:33.859
LIFE.

00:16:33.926 --> 00:16:36.095
REDISTRICTING IS A SORT OF THIS

00:16:36.161 --> 00:16:37.129
CAN BE A TOPIC FOR WANT SERVICES

00:16:37.196 --> 00:16:38.297
ONLY COMES UP EVERY TEN YEARS

00:16:38.364 --> 00:16:39.565
BUT SOME PEOPLE REALLY.

00:16:39.631 --> 00:16:41.233
SPECIALIZE IN IT SO I'M JUST

00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:42.634
WONDERING AT THE LEGISLATIVE

00:16:42.701 --> 00:16:43.836
ANALYST'S OFFICE IS DONE.

00:16:43.902 --> 00:16:45.871
AN ANALYSIS OF SAY THE LAST FOUR

00:16:45.938 --> 00:16:46.638
CYCLES.

00:16:46.705 --> 00:16:48.907
HOW MUCH WAS SPENT?

00:16:48.974 --> 00:16:52.111
WHAT COULD BE?

00:16:52.177 --> 00:16:54.346
CALCULATED IS IS AS HAVING BEEN

00:16:54.413 --> 00:16:57.216
MAYBE THE PERCEIVED BENEFIT.

00:16:57.282 --> 00:16:57.916
IT JUST.

00:16:57.983 --> 00:16:58.751
SEEMS LIKE SOMEONE WOULD WANT TO

00:16:58.817 --> 00:17:00.686
BE INTERESTED IN THAT THAT IS IS

00:17:00.753 --> 00:17:02.988
IS THAT AVAILABLE -- YES IT IS

00:17:03.055 --> 00:17:03.922
AN AIRPORT I'M NOT GONNA HAVE

00:17:03.989 --> 00:17:05.224
THE EXACT NUMBERS OFF THE TOP OF

00:17:05.290 --> 00:17:06.425
MY HEAD BUT I WILL SAY THE

00:17:06.492 --> 00:17:07.559
AMOUNT THAT WAS SPENT IN THE

00:17:07.626 --> 00:17:09.395
LAST TWO SENTENCES CENSUSES WAS

00:17:09.461 --> 00:17:10.996
SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN THE

00:17:11.063 --> 00:17:11.764
AMOUNT THAT IS BEING PROPOSED

00:17:11.830 --> 00:17:13.365
THIS YEAR -- I BELIEVE IT MIGHT

00:17:13.432 --> 00:17:15.501
HAVE BEEN FIVE MILLION BY STATE

00:17:15.567 --> 00:17:17.169
MONEY IN -- TWENTY TEN BUT THAT

00:17:17.236 --> 00:17:18.170
WAS COUPLED WITH ACTUALLY A LOT

00:17:18.237 --> 00:17:21.373
OF PRIVATE MONEY EYES THIS IS TO

00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:22.608
ON A LOT OF THE PROPOSALS ARE.

00:17:22.674 --> 00:17:23.942
FOR PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS ALSO

00:17:24.009 --> 00:17:26.145
HAVE -- MONEY INVOLVED AND THEN

00:17:26.211 --> 00:17:37.122
IN.

00:17:37.189 --> 00:17:37.756
TWO THOUSAND I BELIEVE CAROLINE

00:17:37.823 --> 00:17:38.390
SHE RELIGIOUSLY MALES OFFICE I

00:17:38.457 --> 00:17:39.057
BELIEVE IN TWO THOUSAND THERE IS

00:17:39.124 --> 00:17:39.591
ABOUT TEN MILLION DOLLARS

00:17:39.658 --> 00:17:40.893
APPROPRIATED FOR THE CENSUS BUT

00:17:40.959 --> 00:17:41.627
I I THINK YOUR QUESTION I

00:17:41.693 --> 00:17:42.127
SENATOR HAD TO DO WITH

00:17:42.194 --> 00:17:43.629
REDISTRICTING WHICH IS A

00:17:43.695 --> 00:17:45.230
SEPARATE PROCESS -- RIGHT.

00:17:45.297 --> 00:17:46.064
THE CENSUS INFORMS THE STATE'S

00:17:46.131 --> 00:17:46.698
REDISTRICTING PROCESS BUT THERE

00:17:46.765 --> 00:17:47.800
IS A SEPARATE APPROPRIATION THAT

00:17:47.866 --> 00:17:49.568
OCCURS TO PAY FOR THAT THAT

00:17:49.635 --> 00:17:51.003
PROCESS THAT WAS.

00:17:51.069 --> 00:17:52.070
ESTABLISHED THROUGH THROUGH A

00:17:52.137 --> 00:17:54.440
PROPOSITION AND BUT I'M NOT SURE

00:17:54.506 --> 00:17:56.008
MAYBE YOUR QUESTION IS ABOUT

00:17:56.074 --> 00:17:56.608
BOTH WELL BEHIND OR EVERY SEE

00:17:56.675 --> 00:17:57.743
THE CENSUS IS CRITICAL BECAUSE

00:17:57.810 --> 00:17:59.611
YOU'RE DOING THE REDISTRICTING

00:17:59.678 --> 00:18:00.846
AS WELL BUT YOU'RE YOU'RE ALSO

00:18:00.913 --> 00:18:02.548
GETTING YOUR POPULATION NUMBERS

00:18:02.614 --> 00:18:03.549
FOR YOUR FUNDING.

00:18:03.615 --> 00:18:05.184
FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THE

00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:05.884
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S AROUND REAL

00:18:05.951 --> 00:18:06.952
BOB SO THIS IS.

00:18:07.019 --> 00:18:08.253
MY SECOND TIME THROUGH ONE OF

00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:09.455
THESE -- WIT THE FIRST WAS AS A

00:18:09.521 --> 00:18:11.757
SUPERVISOR BACK IN TWO THOUSAND

00:18:11.824 --> 00:18:14.026
AND GETTING READY FOR ALL THE

00:18:14.092 --> 00:18:15.127
FUN WORKING WITH THE FEDERAL

00:18:15.194 --> 00:18:15.627
GOVERNMENT.

00:18:15.694 --> 00:18:17.162
THE SEWERS SO SINCE WE'VE BEEN

00:18:17.229 --> 00:18:18.464
DOING THIS THERE ARE YOU KNOW I

00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:19.731
FOUND AT THAT TIME THAT THERE

00:18:19.798 --> 00:18:21.099
ARE SOME PEOPLE TO SPECIALIZE.

00:18:21.166 --> 00:18:23.135
THE KIND OF COME OUT OF THE

00:18:23.202 --> 00:18:24.436
WOODWORK EVERY TEN YEARS IN

00:18:24.503 --> 00:18:24.870
KINDA.

00:18:24.937 --> 00:18:26.071
YOU KNOW REALLY AREN'T THAT'S

00:18:26.138 --> 00:18:27.806
LIKE A HOBBY AND AND SO I'M I'M

00:18:27.873 --> 00:18:29.842
JUST SORT OF CURIOUS ABOUT WHAT

00:18:29.908 --> 00:18:31.777
WHAT IF WE DID WHAT WE LEARNED

00:18:31.844 --> 00:18:33.212
WHAT WE SPEND.

00:18:33.278 --> 00:18:35.447
YOU GIVEN THAT YOU KNOW AND AND

00:18:35.514 --> 00:18:37.115
WHY IF IT WOULD ONLY SPEND FIVE

00:18:37.182 --> 00:18:38.717
MILLION TO TEN MILLION.

00:18:38.784 --> 00:18:45.057
THE LAST TWO CYCLES WIRE TO

00:18:45.123 --> 00:18:46.291
WHITE WHITE TWO HUNDRED MILLION.

00:18:46.358 --> 00:18:46.959
SO THOSE ARE THOSE ARE THE

00:18:47.025 --> 00:18:48.660
APPROPRIATIONS FOR THE PAST --

00:18:48.727 --> 00:18:49.495
CENSUS OUT REACH EFFORTS BY THE

00:18:49.561 --> 00:18:50.295
STATE AND THEN THERE IS A

00:18:50.362 --> 00:18:50.896
SEPARATE APPROPRIATION PROCESS

00:18:50.963 --> 00:18:52.498
THAT IS SPELL AND AND FUNDING

00:18:52.564 --> 00:18:53.599
PROCESSES SPELLED OUT BY THE

00:18:53.665 --> 00:18:55.334
PROPOSITION FOR THE PURPOSES OF

00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:57.336
STATE REDISTRICTING AND HOW THAT

00:18:57.402 --> 00:19:01.373
PROCESS UNFOLDS -- THE YOU KNOW

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:02.908
THERE ARE THERE ARE A LOT OF

00:19:02.975 --> 00:19:07.279
CHANGES OCCURRING IN THE TWENTY

00:19:07.346 --> 00:19:07.846
TWENTY CENSUS ARM THAT HAVE

00:19:07.913 --> 00:19:08.814
PROMPTED A LOT OF THE EMPHASIS

00:19:08.881 --> 00:19:10.949
ON OUTREACH -- INCLUDING RELYING

00:19:11.016 --> 00:19:14.052
ON FOLKS TO RESPOND -- VIA THE

00:19:14.119 --> 00:19:15.387
INTERNET PRIMARILY AND OTHER

00:19:15.454 --> 00:19:17.189
CHANGES AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL TO

00:19:17.256 --> 00:19:18.557
THE SENSES AND I THINK THAT IT

00:19:18.624 --> 00:19:20.592
HAS BEEN A LOT OF WHY THE STATE

00:19:20.659 --> 00:19:23.161
HAS PUT SO MUCH EMPHASIS ON

00:19:23.228 --> 00:19:24.863
INCREASING OUTRAGE THIS YEAR.

00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:26.398
LET ME ALSO ADD THAT WALL AND

00:19:26.465 --> 00:19:27.900
THE LAST TWO SENSES WERE

00:19:27.966 --> 00:19:29.301
CONSIDERED VERY ACCURATE FROM A

00:19:29.368 --> 00:19:30.736
NATIONAL PERSPECTIVE THERE WAS

00:19:30.802 --> 00:19:32.204
STILL AN UNDERCOUNT IN

00:19:32.271 --> 00:19:32.804
CALIFORNIA.

00:19:32.871 --> 00:19:34.306
AND ACTUALLY THAT HAS SORT OF

00:19:34.373 --> 00:19:36.575
THIS DOUBLE WHAMMY AFFECT FOR

00:19:36.642 --> 00:19:37.376
THE STATE WHERE IF YOUR

00:19:37.442 --> 00:19:38.777
ACCOUNTING EVERYONE ELSE

00:19:38.844 --> 00:19:39.711
ACCURATELY IN YOUR COUNTING

00:19:39.778 --> 00:19:41.280
CALIFORNIA LESS THAN THE HOUSE

00:19:41.346 --> 00:19:42.814
IMPLICATIONS FOR REDISTRICTING.

00:19:42.881 --> 00:19:45.951
ALSO THIS YEAR -- CALIFORNIA IS

00:19:46.018 --> 00:19:47.252
SORT OF FOR THE FIRST TIME AT

00:19:47.319 --> 00:19:48.387
RISK OF POTENTIALLY LOSING A

00:19:48.453 --> 00:19:49.988
SEAT AND SO THOSE MARGINAL

00:19:50.055 --> 00:19:51.723
DIFFERENCES IN POPULATION CAN

00:19:51.790 --> 00:19:54.960
MAKE A PRETTY BIG DIFFERENCE.

00:19:55.027 --> 00:19:55.561
IN TERMS OF GETTING ACCURATELY

00:19:55.627 --> 00:19:56.628
COUNTED.

00:19:56.695 --> 00:19:57.229
AND SO THAT'S WHY WE'RE GONNA

00:19:57.296 --> 00:19:58.096
SPEND TEN TO TWENTY TIMES MORE

00:19:58.163 --> 00:20:00.999
THAN THE LAST CYCLE.

00:20:01.066 --> 00:20:02.234
SO I SHOULD CLARIFY THAT

00:20:02.301 --> 00:20:03.569
SPENDING IS NOT FOR THE

00:20:03.635 --> 00:20:05.270
CONGRESSIONAL SEAT IN PARTICULAR

00:20:05.337 --> 00:20:06.438
IT IS FOR THE WHOLE RANGE OF

00:20:06.505 --> 00:20:07.973
MAKING SURE THAT WERE ELIGIBLE

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:09.308
FOR ALL THE FEDERAL FUNDING THAT

00:20:09.374 --> 00:20:10.576
WE SHOULD E ENTITLED TO UNDER

00:20:10.642 --> 00:20:12.311
OUR ACTUAL POPULATION.

00:20:12.377 --> 00:20:13.145
AND THEN AS LA -- MENTION

00:20:13.211 --> 00:20:15.180
BRIEFLY BUT A LOT BOTH IN TERMS

00:20:15.247 --> 00:20:15.647
OF WHAT WE DO FOR THE

00:20:15.714 --> 00:20:17.583
ADMINISTRATION AND EVEN JUST THE

00:20:17.649 --> 00:20:18.984
GENERAL ALLOCATION OF THE

00:20:19.051 --> 00:20:20.118
FEDERAL FUNDING.

00:20:20.185 --> 00:20:21.520
IS OFTEN DEPENDENT ON THE CENSUS

00:20:21.587 --> 00:20:22.721
COUNT NOT SIMPLY THE STATE

00:20:22.788 --> 00:20:24.756
COMPARED TO OTHER STATES THAT

00:20:24.823 --> 00:20:25.190
DOES MATTER FOR THE

00:20:25.257 --> 00:20:26.191
CONGRESSIONAL SEAT AND

00:20:26.258 --> 00:20:27.292
DISTRIBUTION OF FEDERAL FUNDING

00:20:27.359 --> 00:20:29.027
ACROSS THE NATION BUT EVEN

00:20:29.094 --> 00:20:30.662
WITHIN THE STATE WHEN -- WE ARE

00:20:30.729 --> 00:20:32.564
DIRECTING RESOURCES OFTEN THOSE

00:20:32.631 --> 00:20:34.366
FORMULAS ARE DEPENDENT ON CENSUS

00:20:34.433 --> 00:20:36.401
COUNTS AND SO IT'S IMPORTANT

00:20:36.468 --> 00:20:37.703
THAT THOSE BE AS ACCURATE AS

00:20:37.769 --> 00:20:39.137
POSSIBLE NO NO I I FULLY

00:20:39.204 --> 00:20:40.872
UNDERSTAND IS A FORMER

00:20:40.939 --> 00:20:43.008
SUPERVISOR I FULLY GET IT.

00:20:43.075 --> 00:20:43.976
BUT I'M JUST KIND OF LOOKING AT

00:20:44.042 --> 00:20:46.111
THAT EXPERIENCE TO THIS.

00:20:46.178 --> 00:20:47.913
ONE JUST TRYING.

00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:48.547
TO YOU KNOW COMPARE THAT'S ALL

00:20:48.614 --> 00:20:49.314
I'VE GOT IS THE EVERY TEN YEARS

00:20:49.381 --> 00:20:50.382
WE LOOK AND SEE WHAT WE'VE DONE

00:20:50.449 --> 00:20:51.984
BEFORE NOW WHAT ARE WE DOING

00:20:52.050 --> 00:20:53.485
THIS TIME AND WHY.

00:20:53.552 --> 00:20:54.753
RIGHT AND SO I THINK LA A

00:20:54.820 --> 00:20:56.421
MENTION BUT WE DO BELIEVE IN

00:20:56.488 --> 00:20:58.023
THIS CASE -- THERE ARE SOME

00:20:58.090 --> 00:21:00.025
RISKS -- TO A PROPER COUNT THAT

00:21:00.092 --> 00:21:01.093
WE HAVEN'T SEEN IN PREVIOUS

00:21:01.159 --> 00:21:02.361
CENSUS CYCLES.

00:21:02.427 --> 00:21:04.029
AND YOU'VE BEEN ABLE TO QUANTIFY

00:21:04.096 --> 00:21:04.563
IT AND IT'S PRETTY SERIOUS

00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:05.998
AMOUNT.

00:21:06.064 --> 00:21:07.833
WHAT IS AT STAKE IS A SERIOUS IS

00:21:07.899 --> 00:21:10.669
A SERIOUS MATTER?

00:21:10.736 --> 00:21:11.837
THANK YOU MANAGER THANK YOU CAN

00:21:11.903 --> 00:21:15.907
IT IS MY SENSE ALSO GIVEN THE

00:21:15.974 --> 00:21:17.042
EXTREME.

00:21:17.109 --> 00:21:18.777
NATURE OF THE DIFFERENCE IN

00:21:18.844 --> 00:21:20.278
TERMS OF OUR EXPERIENCE WITH

00:21:20.345 --> 00:21:21.947
PAST ADMINISTRATIONS IN TERMS OF

00:21:22.014 --> 00:21:23.315
WHAT'S IN THE NEW POSSIBLE PUT

00:21:23.382 --> 00:21:25.384
FORWARD DOUBLE IMPACT THIS

00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:27.753
CENSUS COLLECTION EXPERIENCE.

00:21:27.819 --> 00:21:30.122
MISS SKINNER.

00:21:30.188 --> 00:21:31.957
TIME THANK YOU I WANTED TO ADD

00:21:32.024 --> 00:21:34.459
TO THAT THE THE REASONS --

00:21:34.526 --> 00:21:37.896
DISCUSSED SO FAR HAVE BEEN --

00:21:37.963 --> 00:21:39.665
THE LEGITIMATE IMPORTANT BUT I

00:21:39.731 --> 00:21:40.632
THINK WHAT.

00:21:40.699 --> 00:21:43.168
WAS AN ADDED IN THIS WERE COUPLE

00:21:43.235 --> 00:21:46.004
THINGS IF WE TAKE. TWENTY TEN

00:21:46.071 --> 00:21:50.809
COMPARE -- TO THIS YEAR -- WE'VE

00:21:50.876 --> 00:21:53.578
HAD A GROWTH A SIGNIFICANT

00:21:53.645 --> 00:21:54.413
GROWTH IN HOMELESSNESS IN

00:21:54.479 --> 00:21:56.448
CALIFORNIA.

00:21:56.515 --> 00:21:57.783
ON HOUSE TO PEOPLE.

00:21:57.849 --> 00:22:00.185
AND OUR OWN HOUSE TO PEOPLE JUST

00:22:00.252 --> 00:22:02.888
IN THE LAST TWO YEAR PERIOD NOT

00:22:02.954 --> 00:22:05.123
COUNTING FOR NINETEEN BUT ROSE

00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:06.858
BY 17%.

00:22:06.925 --> 00:22:09.361
ACROSS THE STATE SO WE KNOW THAT

00:22:09.428 --> 00:22:11.563
THAT FIGURE WAS EVEN HIGHER STE --

00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:13.565
OVER THE TEN YEAR PERIOD THAT'S

00:22:13.632 --> 00:22:15.600
A POPULATION THAT IS VERY HARD

00:22:15.667 --> 00:22:16.468
TO COUNT.

00:22:16.535 --> 00:22:18.637
NOW WHEN WE THINK ABOUT WHAT IS

00:22:18.704 --> 00:22:19.805
THE MONEY THAT WE LOSE IF WE

00:22:19.871 --> 00:22:20.906
UNDERCOUNT.

00:22:20.972 --> 00:22:23.141
IT IS EXACTLY THE TYPE OF FUNDS

00:22:23.208 --> 00:22:26.011
THAT SUPPORT OUR MOST LOW INCOME

00:22:26.078 --> 00:22:27.345
RESIDENTS.

00:22:27.412 --> 00:22:28.747
THE RESIDENTS THAT WERE MOST

00:22:28.814 --> 00:22:32.050
LIKELY TO NOT BE COUNTED SO FROM

00:22:32.117 --> 00:22:33.385
MY POINT OF VIEW.

00:22:33.452 --> 00:22:34.753
INDEPENDENT OF IT THERE'S NO

00:22:34.820 --> 00:22:37.889
COMPARISON WITH PAST CENSUS.

00:22:37.956 --> 00:22:39.424
IN TERMS OF WHETHER THIS IS A

00:22:39.491 --> 00:22:41.059
LEGITIMATE EXPENDITURE NOT

00:22:41.126 --> 00:22:42.994
BECAUSE WE HAVE A VERY DIFFERENT

00:22:43.061 --> 00:22:44.362
DEMOGRAPHIC.

00:22:44.429 --> 00:22:46.231
WE HAVE MUCH MORE THE END DUE TO

00:22:46.298 --> 00:22:48.934
THAT MANY MORE PEOPLE THAT COULD

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:50.635
BE UNDER COUNTY.

00:22:50.702 --> 00:22:53.271
AND BE A ON THAT UNDER COUNTING

00:22:53.338 --> 00:22:55.173
CAN RISK THE VERY FINDING THAT

00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:57.843
THAT POPULATION NEEDS SO WE HAVE

00:22:57.909 --> 00:23:00.245
ALL OF THAT AND THEN FINALLY.

00:23:00.312 --> 00:23:01.713
WE HAVE THE FEDERAL

00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:03.815
ADMINISTRATION HAVING GREATLY

00:23:03.882 --> 00:23:07.219
CUT BACK ON THE FEDERAL FUNDING

00:23:07.285 --> 00:23:08.553
FOR OUT OF REACH FOR THE CENSUS

00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:10.555
SO I THINK ALL OF THOSE REASONS

00:23:10.622 --> 00:23:12.023
TO JUSTIFY.

00:23:12.090 --> 00:23:14.993
INCREASED OF FULL VERY INCREASED

00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:17.529
EXPENDITURE ON THE PART OF

00:23:17.596 --> 00:23:18.597
CALIFORNIA.

00:23:18.663 --> 00:23:19.231

00:23:23.101 --> 00:23:23.235
OFTEN.

00:23:23.301 --> 00:23:26.972

REASSESS ITS FEE STRUCTURE -- IN

00:49:38.075 --> 00:49:39.242

COME IN EACH YEAR AS WE CLEARLY

00:49:48.585 --> 00:49:50.020
HAVE A PROBLEM.

00:49:50.087 --> 00:49:51.221
THE FUND HAS BEEN INSTALLED IN

00:49:51.288 --> 00:49:53.323
FOR SEVERAL YEARS-- THE STATE

00:49:53.390 --> 00:49:56.426
OPERATES SEVERAL UNPAID WAGE

00:49:56.493 --> 00:49:58.495

00:49:58.562 --> 00:50:00.030
FLEXIBILITY WITHIN THOSE SORT OF

GARMENT FUND FOR THIS PURPOSE --

00:50:10.841 --> 00:50:11.942
BUT IT APPEARS AT THIS POINT

00:50:12.008 --> 00:50:13.777
THAT THOSE TRANSFERS ARE NOW

00:50:13.844 --> 00:50:16.546
LIMITED -- GIVEN THE RESOURCES

00:50:16.613 --> 00:50:17.647

00:50:31.828 --> 00:50:32.763
ADMINISTRATION.

00:50:32.829 --> 00:50:33.797
MY UNDERSTANDING WAS THAT

00:50:33.864 --> 00:50:35.532
ORIGINALLY THE ADMINISTRATION

00:50:35.599 --> 00:50:37.534
HAD PROPOSED SOME TRAILER BILL

00:50:37.601 --> 00:50:39.403
LANGUAGE THAT WOULD HAVE A LINE

00:50:39.469 --> 00:50:40.971
SOME OF THE STATUTES.

00:50:41.037 --> 00:50:42.372

00:50:44.007 --> 00:50:45.509
PROGRAMS AND I WOULD HAVE THE

00:50:45.575 --> 00:50:47.177
EFFECT OF REDUCING LONG TERM

00:50:47.244 --> 00:50:48.412
LIABILITIES AND THAT PROGRAM IS

00:50:48.478 --> 00:50:49.346
SET.

00:50:49.413 --> 00:50:50.080
BY THOSE IS A TRAILER BILL

00:50:50.147 --> 00:50:52.482
LANGUAGE STILL PART OF THE

00:50:52.549 --> 00:50:56.253
ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL.

00:50:56.319 --> 00:50:57.254
HI DANIEL BRANDON DEPARTMENT OF

TRAILER BILL AND AROUND EARLY

00:51:00.657 --> 00:51:03.927
MAY -- LATE APRIL AND WE WANTED

00:51:03.994 --> 00:51:05.295
TO TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT IT SOME

00:51:05.362 --> 00:51:06.630
WORK ON IT A LITTLE BIT MORE WE

00:51:06.696 --> 00:51:08.865
HAD SOME ISSUES.

00:51:08.932 --> 00:51:10.667
OKAY SO THAT'S ACTUALLY PART OF

00:51:10.734 --> 00:51:11.768
THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL

00:51:11.835 --> 00:51:13.103
THIS YEAR BUT DO ANTICIPATE

00:51:13.170 --> 00:51:14.171
MAYBE AND NEXT YEAR THAT IT'LL

00:51:14.237 --> 00:51:15.639
BE.

00:51:15.705 --> 00:51:17.040
I DON'T WANT TO SPEAK TO WHAT

00:51:17.107 --> 00:51:18.575

00:51:21.378 --> 00:51:22.279
PROBLEMS THAT.

00:51:22.345 --> 00:51:23.580
THE PROGRAM OBVIOUSLY NEEDS

00:51:23.647 --> 00:51:25.115
ATTENTION I THOUGHT THAT THE

00:51:25.182 --> 00:51:26.483
ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL AT

00:51:26.550 --> 00:51:27.784
AREA MADE A LOT OF SENSE WAS

00:51:27.851 --> 00:51:28.819
DISAPPOINTED TO SEE THAT

00:51:28.885 --> 00:51:32.289
LANGUAGE WITHDRAWN.

00:51:32.355 --> 00:51:34.224
WHAT'S MORE LOCK.

00:51:34.291 --> 00:51:36.560
THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR -- I'M

00:51:36.626 --> 00:51:38.061
JUST CURIOUS ABOUT THE GARMENT

00:51:38.128 --> 00:51:39.796
MANUFACTURER SPECIAL ACCOUNT

00:51:39.863 --> 00:51:41.598
THANKS FOR THE HISTORY --

00:51:41.665 --> 00:51:44.301
SOMETHING HAPPENED WAGE STAFFED.

00:51:44.367 --> 00:51:46.236
SO WE DECIDED.

00:51:46.303 --> 00:51:47.304
OUR PREDECESSORS DECIDED TO

00:51:47.370 --> 00:51:49.072
ASSESS.

00:51:49.139 --> 00:51:52.142
OTHER MEMBERS OF THAT INDUSTRY.

00:51:52.209 --> 00:51:53.677
AND THOSE FUNDS WOULD GO INTO

00:51:53.743 --> 00:51:55.412
THIS ACCOUNT IN THAT WE WOULD

00:51:55.479 --> 00:51:56.980
PAY.

00:51:57.047 --> 00:51:59.149
THOSE THAT LOST WAGES FROM THE

00:51:59.216 --> 00:52:03.753
BAD ACTORS IN THAT INDUSTRY --

00:52:03.820 --> 00:52:05.121
SO I'M JUST NOW THE BALLOTS

00:52:05.188 --> 00:52:06.523
FALLING SHORT SO.

00:52:06.590 --> 00:52:08.291
IS IT BECAUSE THE INDUSTRY IS

00:52:08.358 --> 00:52:10.026
DWINDLING.

00:52:10.093 --> 00:52:13.897
OR THE FEE IS TOO LOW.

00:52:13.964 --> 00:52:15.966
BASED ON OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH

00:52:16.032 --> 00:52:17.400

PROPOSAL -- WE UNDERSTAND THAT

00:52:21.004 --> 00:52:22.072
OF THE FEE STRUCTURE IS

00:52:22.138 --> 00:52:23.773
STATUTORY SO IT'S NOT CHANGING

00:52:23.840 --> 00:52:26.409
WITH INFLATION ODD TO ACCOUNT.

00:52:26.476 --> 00:52:27.844
FOR THE STATE THE INCREASE IN

00:52:27.911 --> 00:52:28.478
THE MINIMUM WAGE SO WE'VE SEEN

00:52:28.545 --> 00:52:30.280
LAST EARLIER SO THAT'S ON THE

00:52:30.347 --> 00:52:32.282
THE REVENUE SIDE THERE'S IT'S

00:52:32.349 --> 00:52:33.717
STATIC.

00:52:33.783 --> 00:52:35.852
N. ON THE ON THE CLAIM SIDE

00:52:35.919 --> 00:52:37.320
CLAIMS ARE MORE VALUABLE FOR

00:52:37.387 --> 00:52:39.356
THAT SAME REASON -- INCREASED

00:52:39.422 --> 00:52:41.124
WAGES BUT ALSO WE UNDERSTAND

00:52:41.191 --> 00:52:43.126
THAT THAT THE NUMBER OF CLAIMS

00:52:43.193 --> 00:52:44.394
COMING IN EACH YEAR HAS

00:52:44.461 --> 00:52:46.763
INCREASED IN RECENT YEARS SO THE

00:52:46.830 --> 00:52:49.699
THE TOTAL SORT OF DRAW FOR LACK

00:52:49.766 --> 00:52:51.134
OF A BETTER PHRASE ON THE

00:52:51.201 --> 00:52:52.569
MANUFACTURE SPECIAL COUNT IS

00:52:52.636 --> 00:52:54.504
LARGER -- IN THE LAST SEVERAL

00:52:54.571 --> 00:52:55.972
YEARS AS A HAS BEEN THAN IT HAS

00:52:56.039 --> 00:52:57.240
BEEN HISTORICALLY.

00:52:57.307 --> 00:52:59.643
AND IN THE CLAIMS ARE RESULT OF

00:52:59.709 --> 00:53:02.178
BUSINESSES CLOSING AND LEAVING.

00:53:02.245 --> 00:53:03.580
AND NOT MAKING THE FINAL

00:53:03.647 --> 00:53:04.514
PAYCHECK.

00:53:04.581 --> 00:53:07.551
THAT THAT'S CORRECT GENERALLY --

00:53:07.617 --> 00:53:09.586
THERE ARE SEVERAL INDUSTRIES IN

00:53:09.653 --> 00:53:11.021
CALIFORNIA FOR WHICH THE

00:53:11.087 --> 00:53:12.322
LEGISLATURE AND THE

00:53:12.389 --> 00:53:14.190
ADMINISTRATION AS HAVE DEVELOPED

00:53:14.257 --> 00:53:16.426
SPECIAL ACCOUNTS FOR UNPAID

00:53:16.493 --> 00:53:19.930
WAGES -- AND GARMENT WORKERS IN

00:53:19.996 --> 00:53:22.365
GOVERNMENTAL FRACTURES IS ONE OF

00:53:22.432 --> 00:53:24.501
THOSE BECAUSE OF THE LIKELY

00:53:24.568 --> 00:53:26.236
HARDER OR RELATIVELY HIGH

00:53:26.303 --> 00:53:29.472
PROBABILITY THAT A WAGE CLAIM IS

00:53:29.539 --> 00:53:31.875
ON RECOVERABLE FROM THE EMPLOYER.

00:53:31.942 --> 00:53:34.110
SO WE HAVE AN INDUSTRY THAT.

00:53:34.177 --> 00:53:36.112
IS BARELY MAKING IT.

00:53:36.179 --> 00:53:37.881
AND WE'RE CHARGING THEM MORE TO

00:53:37.948 --> 00:53:39.215
TAKE CARE OF THOSE THAT.

00:53:39.282 --> 00:53:42.619

HOW MANY INDUSTRIES ARE WE DOING

00:53:47.991 --> 00:53:49.225

THE GOVERNOR'S TRAILER BILL --

BUT IT ALSO ADOPTED A TRAILER

01:01:15.838 --> 01:01:17.407
BILL LANGUAGE SEPARATE FROM THE

01:01:17.473 --> 01:01:18.908
GOVERNOR'S THAT WOULD ESTABLISH

01:01:18.975 --> 01:01:21.144
THE SPECIFIC MEMBERSHIP.

01:01:27.350 --> 01:01:29.752
ON THE ASSEMBLY REJECTED THE

GOVERNOR'S TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE

01:01:31.220 --> 01:01:32.755
AND INSTEAD DEFERRED THESE

01:01:32.822 --> 01:01:34.690
POLICY QUESTIONS TO THE

01:01:34.757 --> 01:01:36.025
LEGISLATIVE POLICY PROCESS --

01:01:36.092 --> 01:01:37.393
IT'S SIMILARLY REJECTED THE

01:01:37.460 --> 01:01:38.494
POSITIONS RELATED TO

01:01:38.561 --> 01:01:40.496

THE OUT REACH FUNDING FOR THE

01:01:42.565 --> 01:01:45.001
PAID FAMILY LEAVE PROGRAM.

01:01:45.068 --> 01:01:46.702
ON A OF A FEW COMMENTS FROM OUR

01:01:46.769 --> 01:01:48.638
OFFICE ONE THING WE WANTED TO

01:01:48.704 --> 01:01:49.906
POINT OT WAS IT ALL THREE

01:01:49.972 --> 01:01:52.108
ACTIONS ACKNOWLEDGED THE NEED

01:01:52.175 --> 01:01:53.910
FOR FURTHER WORK AND PAID FAMILY

01:01:53.976 --> 01:01:55.878
LEAVE -- THERE ARE MANY POLICY

01:01:55.945 --> 01:01:57.647
OPTIONS QUESTIONS OUTSTANDING IN

01:01:57.713 --> 01:01:58.848
EACH OF THE THREE ACTIONS

01:01:58.915 --> 01:02:01.050
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THEY DO TAKE

01:02:01.117 --> 01:02:02.251
DIFFERENT APPROACHES THOUGH.

01:02:02.318 --> 01:02:04.620
ON IN BOTH THE ASSEMBLY AND THE

01:02:04.687 --> 01:02:06.923
SENATE ACTIONS RELATED THIS ITEM

01:02:06.989 --> 01:02:09.225
WE SEE THEM AS AMPLIFYING THE

01:02:09.292 --> 01:02:11.060
LEGISLATURE'S ROLE IN

01:02:11.127 --> 01:02:12.962
DETERMINING POLICY FOR PAID

01:02:13.029 --> 01:02:15.098
FAMILY LEAVE GOING FORWARD BOTH

01:02:15.164 --> 01:02:15.598
OPTIONS WOULD GIVE THE

01:02:15.665 --> 01:02:16.966
LEGISLATURE.

01:02:17.033 --> 01:02:18.067
A STRONGER.

01:02:18.134 --> 01:02:19.569
POSITION TO DETERMINE THE

01:02:19.635 --> 01:02:22.371
POLICIES GOING FORWARD FOR PAID

01:02:22.438 --> 01:02:23.206
FAMILY LEAVE.

01:02:23.272 --> 01:02:24.941
ON THE MAIN DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

01:02:25.007 --> 01:02:27.043
THE HOUSES IS THAT THE SENATE

01:02:27.110 --> 01:02:29.445
ACTION ADOPTS THE LENGTHENING OF

01:02:29.512 --> 01:02:30.113
PAID FAMILY LEAVE IN THE BUDGET

01:02:30.179 --> 01:02:31.481
YEAR.

01:02:31.547 --> 01:02:34.250
AND THE ASSEMBLY ACTION DOES NOT --

01:02:34.317 --> 01:02:36.319
THE ASSEMBLY ACTION IN DEFERRING

01:02:36.385 --> 01:02:37.820
THESE QUESTIONS TO THE THE

01:02:37.887 --> 01:02:39.288
POLICY COMMITTEE PROCESS WOULD

01:02:39.355 --> 01:02:40.890
ALLOW SOME FURTHER TIME FOR

01:02:40.957 --> 01:02:42.291
DELIBERATION ABOUT WHETHER TO

01:02:42.358 --> 01:02:43.759
LENGTHEN THE DURATION OF PAID

01:02:43.826 --> 01:02:45.128
FAMILY LEAVE.

01:02:45.194 --> 01:02:46.429
AND WE BRING THAT UP BECAUSE IN

01:02:46.496 --> 01:02:47.964
AN IN AN EARLIER REPORT THAT OUR

01:02:48.030 --> 01:02:50.867
OFFICE PUT OUT EARLIER THIS YEAR.

01:02:50.933 --> 01:02:52.802
ONE OF THE MAIN CONSIDERATIONS

01:02:52.869 --> 01:02:54.537
WE HOPED -- TO RAISE FOR THE

01:02:54.604 --> 01:02:56.372
LEGISLATURE WAS THIS NOTION THAT

01:02:56.439 --> 01:02:59.408
THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD THINK

01:02:59.475 --> 01:03:01.644
CLEARLY ABOUT WHAT IT HOPES TO

01:03:01.711 --> 01:03:02.979
GET OUT OF FAMILY LEAVE.

01:03:03.045 --> 01:03:04.247
BECAUSE IT'S GOALS FOR THE

01:03:04.313 --> 01:03:06.449
PROGRAM REALLY DO DRIVE THE

01:03:06.516 --> 01:03:09.418
POLICY OPTIONS IT MIGHT WANT TO

01:03:09.485 --> 01:03:09.685
EXPLORE.

01:03:09.752 --> 01:03:11.988
ON FOR INSTANCE THERE ARE MANY

01:03:12.054 --> 01:03:13.456
WAYS TO CHANGE PAID FAMILY LEAVE

01:03:13.523 --> 01:03:15.057
LENGTHENING THE DURATION IS BUT

01:03:15.124 --> 01:03:17.126
ONE OF THOSE WAYS YOU COULD ALSO

01:03:17.193 --> 01:03:18.294
LOOK AT THE WAGE REPLACEMENT

01:03:18.361 --> 01:03:19.962
RATE SETS THE AMOUNT OF OF

01:03:20.029 --> 01:03:21.497
BENEFIT.

01:03:21.564 --> 01:03:23.032
THE WEEKLY BENEFIT THAT THAT --

01:03:23.099 --> 01:03:24.400
PARENTS AND CAREGIVERS GET

01:03:24.467 --> 01:03:25.968
DURING PAID FAMILY LEAVE YOU CAN

01:03:26.035 --> 01:03:27.170
LOOK AT FINANCING --

01:03:27.236 --> 01:03:28.671
CONSIDERATION FOR THE PROGRAMMER

01:03:28.738 --> 01:03:30.006
OPTIONS TO MAKE IT MORE FLEXIBLE

01:03:30.072 --> 01:03:31.541
THERE ARE A WHOLE HOST OF POLICY

01:03:31.607 --> 01:03:34.544
OPTIONS -- AND NOT JUST

01:03:34.610 --> 01:03:35.178
LENGTHENING [inaudible]

01:03:35.244 --> 01:03:37.880
ON WE THINK WE AT THIS POINT

01:03:37.947 --> 01:03:39.015
VOTE THE MAIN QUESTION BEFORE

01:03:39.081 --> 01:03:41.083
THE LEGISLATURE IS WHETHER IT'S

01:03:41.150 --> 01:03:42.785
CONFIDENT THAT LENGTHENING LEAVE

01:03:42.852 --> 01:03:44.720
FROM SIX WEEKS TO EIGHT WEEKS

01:03:44.787 --> 01:03:46.055
WILL BE PART OF ITS ULTIMATE

01:03:46.122 --> 01:03:47.623
PACKAGE OF REFORMS FOR THIS

01:03:47.690 --> 01:03:48.691
PROGRAM.

01:03:48.758 --> 01:03:51.394
IF SO -- THE SENATE ACTION TO

01:03:51.460 --> 01:03:52.562
ADOPT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO

01:03:52.628 --> 01:03:53.896
GO TO EIGHT WEEKS AT THIS TIME

01:03:53.963 --> 01:03:55.531
MAY BE THE RIGHT CHOICE.

01:03:55.598 --> 01:03:56.499
IF ON THE OTHER HAND THE

01:03:56.566 --> 01:03:58.467
LEGISLATURE BELIEVES FURTHER

01:03:58.534 --> 01:04:00.570
DELIBERATION ABOUT WHETHER IT'S

01:04:00.636 --> 01:04:02.338
WILL GO FROM SIX WEEKS EIGHT

01:04:02.405 --> 01:04:04.207
WEEKS -- IT'S REQUIRED -- THE

01:04:04.273 --> 01:04:06.008
ASSEMBLY ACTION MAY BE THE BEST

01:04:06.075 --> 01:04:07.176
CHOICE AT THIS TIME [inaudible]

01:04:07.243 --> 01:04:08.377
THANK YOU [inaudible]

01:04:08.444 --> 01:04:09.845
FINANCE.

01:04:09.912 --> 01:04:11.480
THE ADMINISTRATION CONTINUES TO

01:04:11.547 --> 01:04:12.682
SUPPORT ITS MAY REVISION

01:04:12.748 --> 01:04:14.717
PROPOSAL AND BELIEVE STRONGLY

01:04:14.784 --> 01:04:16.852
THAT THIS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED

01:04:16.919 --> 01:04:19.322
AS PART OF THE BUDGET PROCESS

01:04:19.388 --> 01:04:19.622
[inaudible]

01:04:19.689 --> 01:04:20.823
NIELSEN [inaudible]

01:04:20.890 --> 01:04:23.659
HI.

01:04:23.726 --> 01:04:25.628
THE MORE I HEAR [inaudible]

01:04:25.695 --> 01:04:27.463
ELEVATED CONCERNS.

01:04:27.530 --> 01:04:29.265
IN IT DOES APPEAR TO ME THIS IS

01:04:29.332 --> 01:04:30.766
FAR BETTER DEALT WITH IN A

01:04:30.833 --> 01:04:32.301
POLICY COMMITTEE.

01:04:32.368 --> 01:04:34.937
IN A POLICY BILL.

01:04:35.004 --> 01:04:36.305
RATHER THAN SLIPPED IN THE

01:04:36.372 --> 01:04:38.741
BUDGET THAT HAS SOME SIGNIFICANT

01:04:38.808 --> 01:04:39.709
CONSEQUENCES THERE'S SOME

01:04:39.775 --> 01:04:41.177
LANGUAGE HERE THAT SEEMS TO

01:04:41.244 --> 01:04:42.245
INDICATE.

01:04:42.311 --> 01:04:44.814
NO BIG CONSEQUENCES BUT I CAN'T

01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:46.716
QUITE ACCEPT THAT [inaudible]

01:04:46.782 --> 01:04:48.384
AB SO.

01:04:48.451 --> 01:04:49.852
MY OWN POSITION WOULD BE TO

01:04:49.919 --> 01:04:53.389
OPPOSE THIS LANGUAGE.

01:04:53.456 --> 01:04:54.690
LAST WEEK IT WOULD FOR A WEBER

01:04:54.757 --> 01:04:56.259
PREFERRED THAT WE PUT IT OVER.

01:04:56.325 --> 01:04:58.461
NOT TO CONSIDER IT IN THE BUDGET

01:04:58.527 --> 01:05:00.396
BUT CONSIDERED AND A SEPARATE

01:05:00.463 --> 01:05:01.464
BILL.

01:05:01.530 --> 01:05:02.198
IN A FULL POLICY COMMITTEE

01:05:02.265 --> 01:05:04.300
HEARING.

01:05:04.367 --> 01:05:05.835

NO.

01:05:08.404 --> 01:05:11.207
THANK YOU SIR MR OBERNOLTE.

01:05:11.274 --> 01:05:13.442
A QUESTION FOR THE LA -- SO.

01:05:13.509 --> 01:05:16.045
THE PROPOSAL HERE IS TO REDUCE

01:05:16.112 --> 01:05:17.847
THE RESERVE REQUIREMENTS FOR

01:05:17.913 --> 01:05:19.582
THAT ACCOUNT AND I'M WONDERING

01:05:19.649 --> 01:05:21.784
IF THE LA -- FEELS LIKE THAT

REDUCTION IS WARRANTED AND

01:05:23.486 --> 01:05:24.453
WHETHER OR NOT.

01:05:24.520 --> 01:05:25.554
THE ACCOUNT WOULD STILL BE

01:05:25.621 --> 01:05:27.123
SUSTAINABLE WITH THE REDUCED

01:05:27.189 --> 01:05:29.892
RESERVE REQUIREMENTS.

01:05:29.959 --> 01:05:31.727

01:05:55.918 --> 01:06:00.256
REQUIREMENT FROM 45% 230%.

01:06:00.323 --> 01:06:01.324
I'M OUR OFFICE.

01:06:01.390 --> 01:06:02.625
LOOKED BACK AT HISTORICAL DATA

01:06:02.692 --> 01:06:04.193
SENSE THE STATE'S DISABILITY

01:06:04.260 --> 01:06:06.162
INSURANCE FUND WAS ENACTED

01:06:06.228 --> 01:06:07.363
DECADES AGO.

01:06:07.430 --> 01:06:09.098
AND FOUND THAT.

01:06:09.165 --> 01:06:12.068
IT WOULD BE VERY UNLIKELY FOR

01:06:12.134 --> 01:06:13.269
BENEFIT DISBURSEMENTS SO

01:06:13.336 --> 01:06:15.504
PAYMENTS OUT IN ANY GIVEN YEAR

01:06:15.571 --> 01:06:17.640
TO EXCEED WHAT WAS DISBURSING

01:06:17.707 --> 01:06:21.510
THE PRIOR YEAR BY MORE THAN 30%.

01:06:21.577 --> 01:06:23.479
THERE ARE A COUPLE OF COPY ODDS --

01:06:23.546 --> 01:06:24.947
ONE WOULD BE THAT A MAJOR POLICY

01:06:25.014 --> 01:06:27.350
CHANGE FOR ENACTED THAT COULD

01:06:27.416 --> 01:06:29.452
EXCEED Y MORE THAN 30% IF

01:06:29.518 --> 01:06:31.587
BENEFITS WERE INCREASED -- THE

01:06:31.654 --> 01:06:34.724
THE THE OTHER -- AS AT THE

01:06:34.790 --> 01:06:35.891
OBVIOUSLY THE PAST DOESN'T

01:06:35.958 --> 01:06:37.426
ALWAYS DICTATE OR TELL US

01:06:37.493 --> 01:06:39.128
EXCLUSIVELY WILL HAPPEN IN THE

01:06:39.195 --> 01:06:41.464
FUTURE -- BUT THE THE SORT OF IT

01:06:41.530 --> 01:06:43.766
BOILS DOWN -- TO WE BELIEVE THAT

01:06:43.833 --> 01:06:45.368
REDUCING THE RESERVE REQUIREMENT

01:06:45.434 --> 01:06:48.237
FROM 45% 230% WASN'T -- PUTTING

01:06:48.304 --> 01:06:49.538
THE FUND AT RISK OF BECOMING

01:06:49.605 --> 01:06:51.440
INSOLVENT OR THE RESERVE AT RISK

01:06:51.507 --> 01:06:53.376
OF BEING -- DEPLETED IN THE

01:06:53.442 --> 01:06:55.678
FUTURE ALL RIGHT SO JUST SO I

01:06:55.745 --> 01:06:56.746
UNDERSTAND THOUGH.

01:06:56.812 --> 01:06:57.179
CHANGING THE RESERVE

01:06:57.246 --> 01:06:58.581
REQUIREMENTS I JUST A SHORT

01:06:58.647 --> 01:06:59.548
TERM ACTION.

01:06:59.615 --> 01:07:01.083
ABOUT THE LONG TERM THE SOLVENCY

01:07:01.150 --> 01:07:03.119
OF THE FUND DEPENDS ON THE FUND

01:07:03.185 --> 01:07:04.520
BEING REPLENISHED BY.

01:07:04.587 --> 01:07:06.856
CONTRIBUTIONS THAT EMPLOYEES

01:07:06.922 --> 01:07:08.557
MAKE THROUGH THE STI.

01:07:08.624 --> 01:07:12.395
PAYCHECK BOB DEDUCTION AND SO

01:07:12.461 --> 01:07:13.696
THIS QUESTION NUMBER TWO IS WITH

01:07:13.763 --> 01:07:15.631
THE PROVISION OF THIS ADDITIONAL

01:07:15.698 --> 01:07:16.632
FAMILY LEAVE.

01:07:16.699 --> 01:07:19.735
RESULT IN A HIGHER SD I

01:07:19.802 --> 01:07:21.837
CONTRIBUTION RATE FOR CALIFORNIA

01:07:21.904 --> 01:07:23.639
EMPLOYEES.

01:07:23.706 --> 01:07:27.376
IT WOULD YES ON THE STATE'S

01:07:27.443 --> 01:07:29.612
PAYROLL TAX THAT FUNDS THE STI

01:07:29.678 --> 01:07:33.549
FUND -- IS CAPPED AT ONE POINT

01:07:33.616 --> 01:07:35.484
5% OF PAY ROLL UP TO ABOUT OFF

01:07:35.551 --> 01:07:37.486
THE FIRST HUNDRED AND TWENTY

01:07:37.553 --> 01:07:39.221
THOUSAND DOLLARS AND CURRENTLY

01:07:39.288 --> 01:07:41.724
THE RATE IS ABOUT 1% TO FUND

01:07:41.791 --> 01:07:42.525
BENEFITS.

01:07:42.591 --> 01:07:44.293
BUT BENEFITS.

01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:45.861
FUNDED WITH THIS RAY ARE BOTH

01:07:45.928 --> 01:07:47.463
FOR PAID FAMILY LEAVE AND THE

01:07:47.530 --> 01:07:49.298
STATE'S SHORT TERM DISABILITY

01:07:49.365 --> 01:07:51.167
INSURANCE PROGRAM AND THE SHORT

01:07:51.233 --> 01:07:52.268
TERM DISABILITY INSURANCE IS

01:07:52.334 --> 01:07:55.104
ACTUALLY ABOUT 85% OF BENEFITS

01:07:55.171 --> 01:07:56.539
AGO OUT O IT'S A MUCH LARGER

01:07:56.605 --> 01:07:58.007
PART OF THE FUND.

01:07:58.073 --> 01:08:00.609
SUCH THAT A CHANGE.

01:08:00.676 --> 01:08:02.178
AS THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED GOING

01:08:02.244 --> 01:08:03.245
FROM SIX WEEKS EIGHT WEEKS

01:08:03.312 --> 01:08:04.447
THOUGH IT WOULD INCREASE

01:08:04.513 --> 01:08:07.016
BENEFITS -- WOULDN'T HAVE A

01:08:07.082 --> 01:08:08.784
SIGNIFICANT AFFECT ON THE

01:08:08.851 --> 01:08:10.119
PAYROLL TAX RATE WE THINK IT

01:08:10.186 --> 01:08:12.254
WOULD PROBABLY RESULT IN THAT

01:08:12.321 --> 01:08:14.557
THE AN INCREASE OF ABOUT. ONE

01:08:14.623 --> 01:08:16.525
TENTH OF 1% CERTAIN GOING FROM

01:08:16.592 --> 01:08:19.261
1% UNDER CURRENT LAW TO MAYBE

01:08:19.328 --> 01:08:20.796
ONE POINT 1%.

01:08:20.863 --> 01:08:23.399
IN ORDER TO FUND THE PROPOSED

01:08:23.466 --> 01:08:24.733
BENEFITS GOING FORWARD.

01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:25.935
OKAY BUT YOU PUT IT THAT WAY I

01:08:26.001 --> 01:08:27.169
MEAN I I WOULD SAY THAT IS A

01:08:27.236 --> 01:08:28.237
MATERIAL CHANGE BECAUSE IT'S

01:08:28.304 --> 01:08:30.105
YOUR INCREASING THAT PAYROLL TAX

01:08:30.172 --> 01:08:31.874
BY 10%.

01:08:31.941 --> 01:08:33.442
AND AND FOR FORGIVE.

01:08:33.509 --> 01:08:35.244
MY USE OF THE WORD NOT NOTABLE

01:08:35.311 --> 01:08:36.979
OR HOW I CHARACTERIZED THAT OF

01:08:37.046 --> 01:08:38.380
COURSE THAT'S NOTABLE.

01:08:38.447 --> 01:08:39.215
THE VAST MAJORITY THE STATE'S

01:08:39.281 --> 01:08:42.551
WORKFORCE PAYS THIS PAYROLL TAX --

01:08:42.618 --> 01:08:44.186
IN THE CONTEXT OF SPUR MEANING

01:08:44.253 --> 01:08:46.822
UNDER THE ONE POINT 5% CAP --

01:08:46.889 --> 01:08:48.157
THERE THERE WILL BE IMMEDIATE

01:08:48.224 --> 01:08:49.692
CONCERN THAT THAT THE PAYROLL

01:08:49.758 --> 01:08:51.026
TAX WOULD INCREASE ABOVE THAT

01:08:51.093 --> 01:08:53.729
AMOUNT -- BUT BUT YOU'RE RIGHT

01:08:53.796 --> 01:08:55.331
TO THE FEDERAL TAX WOULD

01:08:55.397 --> 01:08:57.433
INCREASE OKAY AND AND I CAN TRY

01:08:57.500 --> 01:08:59.802
TO REMEMBER THE IS THERE A

01:08:59.869 --> 01:09:02.304
MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF ANNUAL PAY

01:09:02.371 --> 01:09:03.539
THAT THE STI IS ASSESSED HONORS

01:09:03.606 --> 01:09:04.139
ITS EVERYTHING UNDER A HUNDRED

01:09:04.206 --> 01:09:05.107
THOUSAND DOLLARS.

01:09:05.174 --> 01:09:06.175
IT I BELIEVE IT'S THIS YEAR

01:09:06.242 --> 01:09:08.344
EVERYTHING UNDER A HUNDRED AND

01:09:08.410 --> 01:09:08.944
EIGHTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS AND

01:09:09.011 --> 01:09:10.279
THAT AMOUNT INCREASES WITH THE

01:09:10.346 --> 01:09:13.182
STATE'S AVERAGE WEEKLY WAGE --

01:09:13.249 --> 01:09:13.949
SO IT DOES INCREASE FROM ONE

01:09:14.016 --> 01:09:15.684
YEAR TO THE NEXT OKAY SO FOR

01:09:15.751 --> 01:09:17.186
SOMEONE MAKING SAY FIFTY

01:09:17.253 --> 01:09:20.689
THOUSAND DOLLARS.

01:09:20.756 --> 01:09:22.758
BUT TENTH OF 1% WOULD BE ANOTHER

01:09:22.825 --> 01:09:24.393
FIFTY DOLLARS A YEAR THE EVERY

01:09:24.460 --> 01:09:26.695
CALIFORNIAN WOULD PAY.

01:09:26.762 --> 01:09:27.429
BUT THE AVERAGE CALIFORNIAN

01:09:27.496 --> 01:09:31.200
WOULD PAY -- TO GET THIS BENEFIT.

01:09:31.267 --> 01:09:33.435
THAT APPEARS TO BE ROUGHLY

01:09:33.502 --> 01:09:35.571
ACCURATE.

01:09:35.638 --> 01:09:37.273
SIR MORE LIVE.

01:09:37.339 --> 01:09:38.908
THE MANAGER JUST TO FOLLOW UP ON

01:09:38.974 --> 01:09:41.644
ON THAT DISCUSSION -- IN THE LA --

01:09:41.710 --> 01:09:43.045
REPORT WE DON'T HAVE LIKE A

01:09:43.112 --> 01:09:46.382
HISTORY OF HOW THE RESERVES BEEN

01:09:46.448 --> 01:09:47.716
DOING THIS INSURANCE FIND OUT.

01:09:47.783 --> 01:09:49.451
HOW MUCH IS GOING IN EVERY YEAR

01:09:49.518 --> 01:09:50.920
HOW MUCH IS GOING OUT?

01:09:50.986 --> 01:09:51.921
IT WAS FOR DISABILITIES SAID IT

01:09:51.987 --> 01:09:56.559
WAS 1% OF ALL WAGES AT ONE POINT --

01:09:56.625 --> 01:09:57.192
SO.

01:09:57.259 --> 01:09:59.361
DO WE HAVE AN ANALYSIS BECAUSE

01:09:59.428 --> 01:10:00.496
IF EVERYONE'S CHIPPING AND THEY

01:10:00.563 --> 01:10:02.998
SHOULD GET A STOCKHOLDERS REPORT

01:10:03.065 --> 01:10:03.165
OUT.

01:10:03.232 --> 01:10:08.370
OF A THING.

01:10:08.437 --> 01:10:10.172
THE ARE THE EMPLOYMENT

01:10:10.239 --> 01:10:11.574
DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT WHICH

01:10:11.640 --> 01:10:13.475
OVERSEES THE FUND DOES ISSUE --

01:10:13.542 --> 01:10:14.810
ANNUAL FUND FORECAST WHICH

01:10:14.877 --> 01:10:16.412
INCLUDE THE AMOUNT OF

01:10:16.478 --> 01:10:17.913
DISBURSEMENTS GOING OUT AS WELL

01:10:17.980 --> 01:10:19.415
AS THE AMOUNT OF COLLECTIONS

01:10:19.481 --> 01:10:20.783
FROM THE PAYROLL TAX.

01:10:20.849 --> 01:10:22.651
INCLUDING ALSO THE RESERVE AND

01:10:22.718 --> 01:10:24.587
PRINT AMOUNT PROJECTED FOR THE

01:10:24.653 --> 01:10:26.121
FORTHCOMING YEAR THAT THAT WOULD

01:10:26.188 --> 01:10:27.856
KEEP THE FUND IN SORT OF ITS

01:10:27.923 --> 01:10:28.891
RESERVE POSITION.

01:10:28.958 --> 01:10:31.594
HAVE YOU DONE ACTUARIAL STUDY.

01:10:31.660 --> 01:10:32.595
TO SEE HOW.

01:10:32.661 --> 01:10:33.596
THIS THIS TWO WEEK EXTENSION

01:10:33.662 --> 01:10:35.130
WOULD.

01:10:35.197 --> 01:10:37.032
WHAT IMPACT THAT THE FUND

01:10:37.099 --> 01:10:37.566
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT YOU'RE

01:10:37.633 --> 01:10:38.567
TALKING ABOUT A?

01:10:38.634 --> 01:10:41.837
BIG SEGMENT OF THE POPULATION

01:10:41.904 --> 01:10:42.438
IT'S GONNA TAKE PARENTAL LEAVE

01:10:42.504 --> 01:10:43.939
RIGHT SO IT'S AS I MENTIONED

01:10:44.006 --> 01:10:45.140
EARLIER THAT THE PAID FAMILY

01:10:45.207 --> 01:10:46.675
LEAVE PORTION OF THE FUND IS

01:10:46.742 --> 01:10:49.211
ABOUT 15% OF BENEFITS THAT ARE

01:10:49.278 --> 01:10:51.947
DISPERSED SO IS THE MINORITY --

01:10:52.014 --> 01:10:56.485
BUT THE THE FUND IS IS.

01:10:56.552 --> 01:10:57.620
THROUGH THE I SHOULD SAY THE

01:10:57.686 --> 01:10:59.254
PAYROLL TAX RATE EACH YEAR IS

01:10:59.321 --> 01:11:01.423
DETERMINED BASED ON THE BALANCE

01:11:01.490 --> 01:11:04.026
OF OP DISBURSEMENTS EXPECTED TO

01:11:04.093 --> 01:11:05.828
BE PAID OUT AS WELL AS

01:11:05.894 --> 01:11:08.097
COLLECTIONS FROM THE PAY THE THE

01:11:08.163 --> 01:11:09.298
PAYROLL TAX SO.

01:11:09.365 --> 01:11:11.667
IN ESSENCE A FORMULA SETS THE

01:11:11.734 --> 01:11:13.369
THE PAYROLL TAX RATE EACH YEAR

01:11:13.435 --> 01:11:15.137
IN ORDER TO KEEP THE RESERVE AND

01:11:15.204 --> 01:11:16.772
THE ACCOUNT AND BALANCE.

01:11:16.839 --> 01:11:18.907
SO IT ISN'T AS A STRAIGHT ONE

01:11:18.974 --> 01:11:20.476
POINT 5% ANYMORE IT'S IT IT

01:11:20.542 --> 01:11:21.477
FLUCTUATES EVERY YEAR THAT'S

01:11:21.543 --> 01:11:22.678
RIGHT IT FLUCTUATES EVERY YEAR

01:11:22.745 --> 01:11:25.014
IT'S CAPPED AT ONE POINT 5% IN

01:11:25.080 --> 01:11:25.514
UNDER.

01:11:25.581 --> 01:11:28.117
CURRENT LAW THIS YEAR IT IS 141%

01:11:28.183 --> 01:11:29.385
BUT WE DON'T NEED TWENTY FIVE

01:11:29.451 --> 01:11:31.654
EMPLOYEES TO DO THE ESTIMATES

01:11:31.720 --> 01:11:33.856
RIGHT.

01:11:33.922 --> 01:11:34.757
LITTLE JOKE CHAIR FROM

01:11:34.823 --> 01:11:36.825
YESTERDAY'S DISCUSSION.

01:11:36.892 --> 01:11:40.529
HA HA HA.

01:11:40.596 --> 01:11:43.832
OKAY I I I THINK WE NEED TO DO A

01:11:43.899 --> 01:11:45.768
MARKETING.

01:11:45.834 --> 01:11:46.869
WE GET IT.

01:11:46.935 --> 01:11:48.437
EXPLAIN TO PEOPLE WHAT THEY'RE

01:11:48.504 --> 01:11:50.806
PAYING FOR THINGS WITH IN THE

01:11:50.873 --> 01:11:51.807
SALON WHICH FELL THANK YOU

01:11:51.874 --> 01:11:53.409
MANAGER.

01:11:53.475 --> 01:11:55.978
WELCOME MISTER MCCARTY.

01:11:56.045 --> 01:11:56.478
THANK YOU.

01:11:56.545 --> 01:11:58.380
SO MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE

01:11:58.447 --> 01:12:00.115
ADMINISTRATION'S POLICY IS TWO

01:12:00.182 --> 01:12:01.583
FOLD.

01:12:01.650 --> 01:12:03.652
TO ON FAMILY PAID FAMILY LEAVE

01:12:03.719 --> 01:12:05.054
WHICH I THINK THERE'S GREAT

01:12:05.120 --> 01:12:07.523
SUPPORT FOR IN THE LEGISLATURE

01:12:07.589 --> 01:12:09.124
IN CALIFORNIA HELPING.

01:12:09.191 --> 01:12:10.859
KNOWLEDGE IS FAMILIES AND

01:12:10.926 --> 01:12:13.796
WORKING MOTHERS AND THEN THE OUT

01:12:13.862 --> 01:12:17.132
THE OUTCOMES OF A YOUNG CHILDREN

01:12:17.199 --> 01:12:19.768
IN CALIFORNIA SO WE'RE ALL ALL

01:12:19.835 --> 01:12:20.169
FALL IN FOR THAT.

01:12:20.235 --> 01:12:23.238
SO IT'S TO EXTEND THE PERIOD

01:12:23.305 --> 01:12:23.972
TIME.

01:12:24.039 --> 01:12:26.875
AT AND ALSO TO HELP PAY FOR THAT

01:12:26.942 --> 01:12:28.777
ADDRESSING THE AMOUNT IN THE

01:12:28.844 --> 01:12:31.480
RESERVE RIGHT SIMPLIFIED.

01:12:31.547 --> 01:12:32.848
AND SO THEN YOU ALSO WANT TO SET

01:12:32.915 --> 01:12:34.083
UP THIS.

01:12:34.149 --> 01:12:36.418
TASK FORCE TO LOOK AT THESE

01:12:36.485 --> 01:12:38.087
OTHER POLICY CHANGES.

01:12:38.153 --> 01:12:39.254
AND AND THERE IS ONE OUT THERE

01:12:39.321 --> 01:12:41.123
BECAUSE YOU KNOW SO MY QUESTION

01:12:41.190 --> 01:12:42.224
TO THE ADMINISTRATION.

01:12:42.291 --> 01:12:46.361
IS TO FOCUS ON THAT WORKERS WHO

01:12:46.428 --> 01:12:47.896
MAKE LESS THAN A HUNDRED

01:12:47.963 --> 01:12:50.933
THOUSAND DOLLARS 41100% WAGE.

01:12:50.999 --> 01:12:53.435
REPLACEMENT AND WANTED TO ASK

01:12:53.502 --> 01:12:54.603
FINANCE HAS THAT BEEN IN YOUR

01:12:54.670 --> 01:12:57.306
CALCULATION SO FAR AND WHAT'S

01:12:57.372 --> 01:13:00.609
YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT AND WAS

01:13:00.676 --> 01:13:02.044
THAT AT ALL PART OF THE

01:13:02.111 --> 01:13:03.645
POTENTIAL PROPOSAL WHEN YOU

01:13:03.712 --> 01:13:05.581
WROTE THIS OUT IN JANUARY.

01:13:05.647 --> 01:13:07.950
SO RIGHT NOW OUR APPROACH IS --

01:13:08.016 --> 01:13:10.119
DEFERRING A QUESTION LIKE THAT

01:13:10.185 --> 01:13:11.687
TO THAT TO THE PROPOSED TASK

01:13:11.754 --> 01:13:14.289
FORCE SAID THE ONE PROPOSAL AS

01:13:14.356 --> 01:13:14.723
YOU NOTED THAT THE

01:13:14.790 --> 01:13:16.125
ADMINISTRATION WAS READY TO GET

01:13:16.191 --> 01:13:17.292
BEHIND THAT WE BELIEVE WE CAN

01:13:17.359 --> 01:13:18.127
GET BEHIND.

01:13:18.193 --> 01:13:19.628
GIVEN THE CURRENT RESERVES IN

01:13:19.695 --> 01:13:22.431
THE FIND WAS EXTENDING FROM SIX

01:13:22.498 --> 01:13:23.599
WEEKS TO EIGHT WEEKS.

01:13:23.665 --> 01:13:24.666
IN TERMS OF QUESTIONS BEYOND

01:13:24.733 --> 01:13:26.769
THAT WHETHER IT IS EXTENDING

01:13:26.835 --> 01:13:28.370
THAT WE DON'T WANT BEYOND EIGHT

01:13:28.437 --> 01:13:29.505
WEEKS WHICH THE ADMINISTRATION

01:13:29.571 --> 01:13:31.640
HAS SAID IS A GOAL OR INCREASING

01:13:31.707 --> 01:13:33.008
ANY PAY LEVELS WERE DEFERRING

01:13:33.075 --> 01:13:34.943
THOSE QUESTIONS. TO THE TASK

01:13:35.010 --> 01:13:36.612
FORCE AND WE KNOW -- TO THE

01:13:36.678 --> 01:13:37.813
DISCUSSION THAT WAS GOING ON

01:13:37.880 --> 01:13:39.047
THAT THOSE QUESTIONS ARE BOUND

01:13:39.114 --> 01:13:41.316
UP WITH HOW WE CAN PAY FOR THOSE

01:13:41.383 --> 01:13:42.017
OVER THE LONG TERM.

01:13:42.084 --> 01:13:44.019
BY SUMA IT'S A TRADE OFF THEY

01:13:44.086 --> 01:13:44.753
PROBABLY.

01:13:44.820 --> 01:13:46.688
HAVE THE EQUAL VALUES THOMAS WAS

01:13:46.755 --> 01:13:47.656
THINGS COST AND SO IN YOUR EYES

01:13:47.723 --> 01:13:49.358
THAT THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT

01:13:49.424 --> 01:13:51.493
ELEMENT IS IS TO EXTEND THE

01:13:51.560 --> 01:13:52.427
PERIOD.

01:13:52.494 --> 01:13:53.996
PEOPLE WOULD GET THE BENEFIT AS

01:13:54.062 --> 01:13:57.733
OPPOSED.

01:13:57.800 --> 01:13:58.934
TO INCREASE THE BENEFIT.

01:13:59.001 --> 01:13:59.902
SO I WOULDN'T PUT IT THAT WAY

01:13:59.968 --> 01:14:00.803
FOR THE ADMINISTRATION -- I

01:14:00.869 --> 01:14:01.804
THINK WHAT WALL WITH THAT WE ARE

01:14:01.870 --> 01:14:02.738
SAYING IS THAT THIS IS THE FIRST

01:14:02.805 --> 01:14:04.206
STEP WE'RE TAKING JUST SIX WEEKS

01:14:04.273 --> 01:14:05.374
TO EIGHT WEEKS WE KNOW THAT THIS

01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:07.075
IS NOT FULLY SOLVE THE ISSUES

01:14:07.142 --> 01:14:08.911
THAT THE ADMINISTRATION AND THAT

01:14:08.977 --> 01:14:09.545
YOU CARE ABOUT AND ARE ALL

01:14:09.611 --> 01:14:11.513
WORKING ON ALL THOSE QUESTIONS

01:14:11.580 --> 01:14:11.880
REQUIRE.

01:14:11.947 --> 01:14:13.749
A LOT OF THOUGHT AND WE'RE

01:14:13.816 --> 01:14:15.450
DIFFERENT ALL THOSE TO THE TASK

01:14:15.517 --> 01:14:15.651
FORCE.

01:14:15.717 --> 01:14:18.187
OKAY THANK YOU.

01:14:18.253 --> 01:14:20.189
WITH REGARD TO THE TASK FORCE

01:14:20.255 --> 01:14:21.990
ARE I WOULD SUGGEST THAT GIVEN

01:14:22.057 --> 01:14:23.392
THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE'S

01:14:23.458 --> 01:14:25.761
HISTORY WITH PAID FAMILY LEAVE

01:14:25.828 --> 01:14:27.262
NATIONALLY AS A POLICY.

01:14:27.329 --> 01:14:29.131
ISSUE ON THAT IT WOULD BEHOOVE

01:14:29.198 --> 01:14:31.266
ALL OF US IF THE TASK FORCE HAD

01:14:31.333 --> 01:14:33.335
REPRESENTATION OR PARTICIPATION

01:14:33.402 --> 01:14:35.070
FROM THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE

01:14:35.137 --> 01:14:36.705
EITHER MEMBERS OR STAFF I NOTE I

01:14:36.772 --> 01:14:38.173
NOTICED THAT THAT THAT WERE NOT

01:14:38.240 --> 01:14:39.875
INCLUDED AT THIS POINT -- BUT

01:14:39.942 --> 01:14:41.743
GIVEN THE PARTNERSHIP WITH WHICH

01:14:41.810 --> 01:14:43.745
WE MUST FORAGE ON TO ADVANCE A

01:14:43.812 --> 01:14:45.280
POLICY THIS CUTTING EDGE IN

01:14:45.347 --> 01:14:46.081
CRITICAL I WOULD HOPE.

01:14:46.148 --> 01:14:48.083
THAT WE WOULD BE FOR THE

01:14:48.150 --> 01:14:49.151
OPPORTUNITY TO BE INCLUDED --

01:14:49.218 --> 01:14:50.452
BECAUSE FROM MY PERSPECTIVE THIS

01:14:50.519 --> 01:14:52.688
IS CERTAINLY A PERFECT EXAMPLE

01:14:52.754 --> 01:14:55.824
OF THE PRO FAMILY POLICY ON THAT

01:14:55.891 --> 01:14:57.993
I THINK OF THE LEGISLATURE'S

01:14:58.060 --> 01:15:00.696
ENGAGEMENT IN -- WOULD -- BE

01:15:00.762 --> 01:15:01.930
MEANINGFUL AND SIGNIFICANT.

01:15:01.997 --> 01:15:03.966
SO I HOPE THAT AS WE CONTINUE TO

01:15:04.032 --> 01:15:08.470
DELIBERATE THIS ISSUE WE CAN BE

01:15:08.537 --> 01:15:11.306
INCLUDED WITH SKINNER.

01:15:11.373 --> 01:15:13.375
ECHO THAT COMMENT BY I HAVE A

01:15:13.442 --> 01:15:14.843
QUESTION ON JUST -- IF THIS WAS

01:15:14.910 --> 01:15:16.044
AN ADDRESS AND I'M JUST CURIOUS

01:15:16.111 --> 01:15:17.112
I DON'T HAVE THE HISTORY ON IT.

01:15:17.179 --> 01:15:19.848
AT WHAT POINT.

01:15:19.915 --> 01:15:22.784
THE WAS IT SAID THAT THE MAXIMUM

01:15:22.851 --> 01:15:25.387
T. TAXABLE WAGE LIMIT WOULD BE

01:15:25.454 --> 01:15:27.990
ABOUT A HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN

01:15:28.056 --> 01:15:30.559
THOUSAND AND IF THAT -- WAGE

01:15:30.626 --> 01:15:32.194
LIMITS WERE.

01:15:32.261 --> 01:15:34.229
RAISED ABOVE THAT WOULD THAT

01:15:34.296 --> 01:15:36.999
HELP OUR FUND BALANCE.

01:15:37.065 --> 01:15:38.700
SINCE WE HAVE PEOPLE RBC THAT

01:15:38.767 --> 01:15:40.669
HAVE WHICH IS HIGHER THAN A

01:15:40.736 --> 01:15:43.772
HUNDRED EIGHTEEN THOUSAND A YEAR.

01:15:43.839 --> 01:15:45.974
SENATOR SKINNER I'M NOT CERTAIN

01:15:46.041 --> 01:15:47.276
WHEN THAT CAP.

01:15:47.342 --> 01:15:49.444
WAS INSTITUTED AS A AS A POLICY

01:15:49.511 --> 01:15:51.613
COMPONENT I DO BELIEVE IT WAS

01:15:51.680 --> 01:15:53.248
MANY YEARS AGO IF NOT DECADES

01:15:53.315 --> 01:15:55.384
AGO IT HAS INCREASED WITH

01:15:55.450 --> 01:15:56.685
INFLATION OVER TIME.

01:15:56.752 --> 01:15:58.487
REGARDING YOUR SECOND POINT

01:15:58.553 --> 01:15:59.922
ABOUT.

01:15:59.988 --> 01:16:01.056
THAT BEING AN OPTION IT'S

01:16:01.123 --> 01:16:02.858
ABSOLUTELY ONE OF THE OPTIONS

01:16:02.925 --> 01:16:04.660
THAT THAT SORT OF WE RECOMMEND

01:16:04.726 --> 01:16:06.728
THE LEGISLATURE CONTEND WITH AND

01:16:06.795 --> 01:16:07.863

FAMILY LEAVE.

01:16:10.565 --> 01:16:12.301
INCREASING THAT AMOUNT -- OF THE

01:16:12.367 --> 01:16:14.970
CAP WOULD PROVIDE ADDITIONAL --

01:16:15.037 --> 01:16:16.905
COLLECTIONS FOR THE FUND WHICH

01:16:16.972 --> 01:16:18.307
COULD BE USED TO PAY FOR

01:16:18.373 --> 01:16:20.208
BENEFITS THAT'S ONE OPTION THAT

01:16:20.275 --> 01:16:20.943
THAT.

01:16:21.009 --> 01:16:22.778
THE LEGISLATURE ABSOLUTELY

01:16:22.844 --> 01:16:24.780

DEPARTMENT HAS THE ABILITY TO

01:16:34.756 --> 01:16:36.525
ADJUST.

01:16:36.591 --> 01:16:38.427

MENSTRUAL PRODUCTS.

01:17:21.937 --> 01:17:23.238
THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WOULD

01:17:23.305 --> 01:17:25.173
AUTHORIZE THESE EXEMPTIONS FOR

01:17:25.240 --> 01:17:27.275

OF TWO THE LEGISLATURE FACES A

01:17:39.221 --> 01:17:40.922
TRADE OFF AND SETTING SUNSET

01:17:40.989 --> 01:17:42.724
DATES FOR TAX EXPENDITURES ON

01:17:42.791 --> 01:17:44.259
ONE HAND.

01:17:44.326 --> 01:17:46.628
A SHORTER SUNSET PROVIDES MORE

01:17:46.695 --> 01:17:47.796
FLEXIBILITY AND MORE

01:17:47.863 --> 01:17:50.098
OPPORTUNITIES FOR OVERSIGHT ON

01:17:50.165 --> 01:17:52.167

PROVIDES MORE CERTAINTY FOR

01:17:53.935 --> 01:17:55.070
TAXPAYERS.

01:17:55.137 --> 01:17:56.638
AND ALLOWS THE LEGISLATURE TO

SPEND MORE OF ITS TIME ON OTHER

01:17:58.540 --> 01:17:59.674
ISSUES.

01:17:59.741 --> 01:18:00.976
IN LIGHT OF THAT TRADE OFF WE'RE

01:18:01.043 --> 01:18:03.011
RECOMMENDING A COMPROMISE THAT

01:18:03.078 --> 01:18:04.479
REFLECTS THE DIFFERENT POLICY

01:18:04.546 --> 01:18:06.882
CONSIDERATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH

THESE TWO EXEMPTIONS.

01:18:08.750 --> 01:18:11.453
SO FIRST ON THE DIAPER EXEMPTION

01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:13.221
WERE RECOMMENDING A SUNSET

01:18:13.288 --> 01:18:15.724
PERIOD OF I IN THE RANGE OF

01:18:17.392 --> 01:18:20.362
EXEMPTION AS ONE TOOL WITHIN A

01:18:20.429 --> 01:18:22.764
BROADER STRATEGY FOR PROVIDING

FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO PARENTS.

01:18:25.267 --> 01:18:26.868
AND THAT'S A STRATEGY THAT THE

01:18:26.935 --> 01:18:28.837
LEGISLATURE ADJUSTS PRETTY

01:18:28.904 --> 01:18:31.740
FREQUENTLY SO THE FLEXIBILITY

01:18:31.807 --> 01:18:33.275
PROVIDED BY FORTY SIX YEAR

01:18:33.341 --> 01:18:34.743
SUNSET COULD BE.

01:18:34.810 --> 01:18:37.412

BASED PRIMARILY ON AN EQUITY

01:18:46.855 --> 01:18:48.824
CONCERN AND SO THAT ADDITIONAL

01:18:48.890 --> 01:18:50.325
FLEXIBILITY THAT WOULD BE GAINED

01:18:50.392 --> 01:18:53.061
FROM A SHORTER SUNSET IS NOT AS

01:18:53.128 --> 01:18:56.398
IMPORTANT.

01:22:26.708 --> 01:22:27.275
THAT WOULD INCREASE THE CREDIT

RANGE SO LOOKING AT THE FIGURE

01:22:34.582 --> 01:22:35.950
ON PAGE.

01:22:36.017 --> 01:22:38.386
ONE IT'S MOVING THE THE PHASE

01:22:38.453 --> 01:22:41.690
OUT SLIP BY SHIFTING THIS WILL

01:22:41.756 --> 01:22:42.290
REFER TO AS THE KING POINT TO

01:22:42.357 --> 01:22:45.860
THE LEFT -- THE IN THE IN THE

01:22:45.927 --> 01:22:47.395
PACKAGE THE GOVERNOR ALSO

01:22:47.462 --> 01:22:50.298

EITC ACOSTA FLIPPING REFUND.

01:23:09.684 --> 01:23:10.218
CERTAINLY NOT A PITCH TO THE

01:23:10.285 --> 01:23:10.819
HAND OUT WE COMPARE THE

01:23:10.885 --> 01:23:12.387
DIFFERENT ACTIONS TAKEN BY EACH

01:23:12.454 --> 01:23:14.389
HOUSE TO EXPAND THE EITC

01:23:14.456 --> 01:23:16.424
STRUCTURE SPECIFICALLY.

01:23:16.491 --> 01:23:17.992
SO THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY BOTH

01:23:18.059 --> 01:23:19.494
ADOPTED THE GENERAL FRAMEWORK

01:23:19.561 --> 01:23:21.296
PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR.

01:23:21.363 --> 01:23:23.565
TOM HOWEVER BOTH HOUSES ALSO

01:23:26.401 --> 01:23:28.303
TO WORKING TAX FILERS WHO DO NOT

01:23:28.370 --> 01:23:29.671
HAVE A SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER.

01:23:29.738 --> 01:23:30.972
BUT INSTEAD FILE THEIR TAX

01:23:31.039 --> 01:23:32.741
RETURNS.

REFER TO AS AN I..

01:23:37.445 --> 01:23:38.847
TEN AND NOW THE KEY DIFFERENCE

01:23:38.913 --> 01:23:40.615
BETWEEN THE HOUSES WAS THAT THE

01:23:40.682 --> 01:23:42.283
ASSEMBLY REDUCED THE ADDITIONAL

01:23:42.350 --> 01:23:43.718
AMOUNT FOR FILERS WITH A CHILD

01:23:43.785 --> 01:23:45.387

01:23:45.453 --> 01:23:47.288
SIX SO THAT THE TOTAL COST.

01:23:47.355 --> 01:23:49.557
OF THERE IS A PROPOSED EXPANSION

01:23:49.624 --> 01:23:51.159
WOULD BE -- LOWER PERSONAL

01:23:51.226 --> 01:23:52.727
INCOME TAX REVENUES OF SIX

01:23:52.794 --> 01:23:54.095
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS.

01:23:54.162 --> 01:23:56.364
AND THAT'S ONLINE TO OF THIS

01:23:56.431 --> 01:23:57.632
TABLE ON PAGE.

01:23:57.699 --> 01:23:59.634
TWO OF WHICH COMPARES TO SEVEN

01:23:59.701 --> 01:24:00.201
HUNDRED AND NINETY MILLION

01:24:00.268 --> 01:24:01.770

01:24:01.836 --> 01:24:02.904
PROPOSAL.

01:24:02.971 --> 01:24:04.639
AND NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTY EIGHT

01:24:04.706 --> 01:24:05.273
MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE SENATE

01:24:05.340 --> 01:24:08.176
ACTION.

01:24:08.243 --> 01:24:10.044
SO TURNING NOW TO PAGE THROUGH

01:24:10.111 --> 01:24:12.781
THE WINDOW.

01:24:12.847 --> 01:24:14.983
OF MEMBERS OF BOTH HOUSES

01:24:15.049 --> 01:24:17.485
EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT THE

01:24:17.552 --> 01:24:19.421
POSSIBILITY THAT THE GOVERNOR'S

01:24:19.487 --> 01:24:21.823

01:24:23.792 --> 01:24:24.025
EIGHTY SEE.

01:24:24.092 --> 01:24:26.027
COULD -- POSSIBLY BE TREATED AS

01:24:26.094 --> 01:24:27.829
INCOME FOR THE PURPOSES OF

01:24:27.896 --> 01:24:29.464
FIGURING ELIGIBILITY AND BENEFIT

01:24:31.599 --> 01:24:32.700
PROGRAMS.

01:24:32.767 --> 01:24:34.602
AND BOTH HOUSES ARE SEEKING

01:24:34.669 --> 01:24:36.638
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BEFORE

01:24:36.704 --> 01:24:38.540
PROCEEDING WITH THAT PLAN SO THE

01:24:38.606 --> 01:24:40.575
SENATE ACTION WAS TO REJECT THE

01:24:40.642 --> 01:24:42.043
GOVERNOR'S ADVANCE MONTHLY.

01:24:42.110 --> 01:24:43.344
PAYMENTS PROPOSAL AND THEY

01:24:43.411 --> 01:24:44.679
ADOPTED BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE

01:24:44.746 --> 01:24:46.014
THAT WOULD REQUIRE THE

01:24:46.080 --> 01:24:47.782
ADMINISTRATION TO PROVIDE MORE

01:24:47.849 --> 01:24:49.617
INFORMATION ON THAT ISSUE.

01:24:49.684 --> 01:24:51.252
THE ASSEMBLY PROVIDED HALF OF

01:24:51.319 --> 01:24:52.787
THE AMOUNT REQUESTED NINE POINT

01:24:52.854 --> 01:24:54.289

ADMINISTRATION OF AN ADVANCE

01:24:55.857 --> 01:24:57.125
MONTHLY PAYMENTS PLAN BUT THAT

01:24:57.192 --> 01:24:58.393
OUR MONEY IS CONTINGENT.

01:24:58.460 --> 01:25:00.562
OR PROVISIONAL ON THE RECEIPT OF

01:25:00.628 --> 01:25:04.699
A SIMILAR REPORT.

01:25:04.766 --> 01:25:06.935
SO IN ADDITION TO THESE ITEMS

01:25:07.001 --> 01:25:08.636
THERE SOME OTHER DIFFERENCES THE

01:25:08.703 --> 01:25:10.004
ASSEMBLY PROVIDED TWO POINT TWO

01:25:10.071 --> 01:25:11.239

CHANGES NECESSARY TO ACCOMMODATE.

01:25:15.777 --> 01:25:16.611
I TEN FILERS WHILE THE SENATE

AND TAKEN IT -- SPECIFIC ACTION

01:25:18.146 --> 01:25:19.214
ON THAT I ISSUE.

01:25:19.280 --> 01:25:20.315
AND LASTLY WE NOTE THAT BOTH

01:25:20.381 --> 01:25:23.017
HOUSES AUGMENTED THE AMOUNT FOR

01:25:23.084 --> 01:25:24.185
OUTREACH BY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS

01:25:24.252 --> 01:25:26.020
BRINGING THE TOTAL AMOUNT FOR

01:25:26.087 --> 01:25:27.889
OUTREACH TO TEN MILLION DOLLARS --

01:25:27.956 --> 01:25:29.023
BUT THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT THESE

01:25:29.090 --> 01:25:30.058
ADOPTED SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT

01:25:30.124 --> 01:25:30.859
BUDGET BILLING WHICH SO

01:25:30.925 --> 01:25:31.993
SPECIFICALLY THE SENATE ADDED

01:25:32.060 --> 01:25:34.362
LANGUAGE ABOUT FREE TAX

01:25:34.429 --> 01:25:35.497
PREPARATION SERVICES.

01:25:35.563 --> 01:25:37.465
WE DON'T HAVE A SET RECOMMEND

01:25:37.532 --> 01:25:38.967
SAID RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING

01:25:39.033 --> 01:25:41.102
THESE DIFFERENCES -- AS THE SIZE

01:25:41.169 --> 01:25:43.071
OF THE EXPANSION WILL NEED TO

01:25:43.137 --> 01:25:44.639
DEPEND ON BALANCING YOUR

01:25:44.706 --> 01:25:46.307
COMPETING PRIORITIES.

01:25:46.374 --> 01:25:47.675
WE THINK THAT THE CAUTIOUS

01:25:47.742 --> 01:25:49.544
APPROACH OF BOTH HOUSES TO THE

01:25:49.611 --> 01:25:51.212
ADVANCE PAYMENTS PLAN IS

01:25:51.279 --> 01:25:53.615
REASONABLE AND EACH APPROACH HAS

01:25:53.681 --> 01:25:53.848
MERIT.

01:25:53.915 --> 01:25:55.116
YEAH -- IF YOU TO EXPAND THE

01:25:55.183 --> 01:25:56.251

SIMPLEST ACTION TO PROVIDE TWO

POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS TO FTP.

01:26:00.154 --> 01:26:02.023
OF FOR THE ADDITIONAL MINISTRY

01:26:02.090 --> 01:26:04.559
OF COST IS REASONABLE.

01:26:04.626 --> 01:26:06.794
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FINANCE.

01:26:06.861 --> 01:26:08.196
THE ADMINISTRATION CONTINUES TO

WHICH IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF

01:26:18.339 --> 01:26:19.641
THE GOVERNOR'S PLAN.

01:26:19.707 --> 01:26:20.842
AND WE CONTINUE TO PLAY THAT

01:26:20.909 --> 01:26:23.111
TALKS CONFORMITY IS THE WAY TO

01:26:23.177 --> 01:26:24.112
PAY FOR THIS PROPOSAL ON AN

01:26:24.178 --> 01:26:27.048
ONGOING BASIS WHILE KEEPING THE

01:26:27.115 --> 01:26:28.616
BUDGET AND STRUCTURAL BALANCE.

01:26:28.683 --> 01:26:29.217
IN THE ADMINISTRATION DOESN'T

01:26:29.284 --> 01:26:32.153
HAVE ANY CONCERNS ABOUT BEING

01:26:32.220 --> 01:26:33.955

ADVANCE PAYMENT OPTIONS SO WE DO

01:26:36.991 --> 01:26:38.960
AND SO -- THE WAY THAT WE ARE

01:26:39.027 --> 01:26:40.662
WORKING ON THIS PROPOSAL IS TO

01:26:40.728 --> 01:26:42.163
ENSURE THAT ALL OF THOSE

01:26:42.230 --> 01:26:43.798
CONCERNS ARE TAKEN CARE OF

01:26:43.865 --> 01:26:45.633
BEFORE WE BEGIN ANY KIND OF

01:26:45.700 --> 01:26:47.035
ADVANCE PAYMENT PROPOSE.

01:26:47.101 --> 01:26:50.138
THANK YOU QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS

MR OBERNOLTE.

01:26:52.206 --> 01:26:53.608
QUESTION FOR THE PARMA FINANCE.

01:26:53.675 --> 01:26:55.343
HOW DOES THE ADMINISTRATION FEEL

01:26:55.410 --> 01:26:56.945
ABOUT THE ACTION TAKEN BY BOTH

01:26:57.011 --> 01:26:59.447
HOUSES TO EXTEND ELIGIBILITY TO

01:26:59.514 --> 01:27:01.249
I TEN FILERS?

01:27:01.316 --> 01:27:04.085
SO RIGHT NOW WE THAT -- PROPOSAL

01:27:04.152 --> 01:27:05.153
IS NOT IN OUR BUDGET AND AS

01:27:05.219 --> 01:27:06.321
WE'VE SEEN FROM THIS DISCUSSION

01:27:06.387 --> 01:27:07.922
LIKE ALL OF US -- WE'RE KEEPING

01:27:07.989 --> 01:27:09.190
A VERY CLOSE EYE ON THE OVERALL

01:27:09.257 --> 01:27:11.092
BUDGET RESILIENCY AND SO WE WERE

01:27:11.159 --> 01:27:13.595
NOT ABLE TO FIT THAT WITHIN OUR

01:27:13.661 --> 01:27:18.032
PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME.

01:27:18.099 --> 01:27:18.600

01:27:30.912 --> 01:27:33.214
ITEM BUT HAPPY TO DESCRIBE

01:27:33.281 --> 01:27:34.549
BRIEFLY IF THAT WORKS GO AHEAD

01:27:34.616 --> 01:27:35.984
AND ANSWERS QUESTIONS YES A

01:27:36.050 --> 01:27:38.386
BASICALLY UNDER THE IT EVERY

01:27:38.453 --> 01:27:40.455
TIMETHAT FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

01:27:40.521 --> 01:27:42.256

TO CONFORM WITH THOSE MEASURES

01:27:47.362 --> 01:27:49.297
AND THOSE ARE DONE FOR A NUMBER

01:27:49.364 --> 01:27:50.431
OF REASONS.

01:27:50.498 --> 01:27:52.166
TO IMPROVE SIMPLICITY AND REDUCE

01:27:52.233 --> 01:27:53.668
THE BURDEN ON TAXPAYERS SO THAT

TAX PURPOSES.

01:27:59.307 --> 01:28:00.108
AND ALSO REDUCES THE NUMBER OF

01:28:00.174 --> 01:28:02.110
ERRORS WHEN PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO

01:28:02.176 --> 01:28:03.277
DO -- THOSE TWO TWO DIFFERENT

01:28:03.344 --> 01:28:05.179
SETS OF CALCULATIONS AND THOSE

01:28:05.246 --> 01:28:06.581
ERRORS CAN WE TO PENALTIES THEY

WE TO A GREATER ADMINISTRATIVE

01:28:07.849 --> 01:28:09.484
BURDEN BOTH ON THE STATE ON THE

01:28:09.550 --> 01:28:10.251
FTV.

FINALLY TO THE EXTENT THAT THE

01:28:13.054 --> 01:28:15.223
CHANGES ARE COULD PUBLIC POLICY

01:28:15.289 --> 01:28:16.324
AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL THAN THE

01:28:16.391 --> 01:28:17.725
STATE CAN TAKE ACTION TO CONFORM

01:28:17.792 --> 01:28:18.860
WITH THOSE SO.

01:28:18.926 --> 01:28:20.228
WHAT THE GOVERNOR HAS PROPOSED

01:28:20.294 --> 01:28:22.196
IN HIS BUDGET AND IN HIS NAY

01:28:22.263 --> 01:28:24.165
REVISION ACE WHILE ACKNOWLEDGING

01:28:24.232 --> 01:28:25.066
THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF

01:28:25.133 --> 01:28:26.334
PROPOSALS IN THE FEDERAL TAX

01:28:26.401 --> 01:28:27.135
REFORM?

01:28:27.201 --> 01:28:28.336
THAT THE GOVERNOR AND HIS

01:28:28.403 --> 01:28:29.404
ADMINISTRATION DID NOT AGREE

01:28:29.470 --> 01:28:31.272
WITH THERE WERE SOME THAT FOR

01:28:31.339 --> 01:28:32.540
SOME THE AFFIRMATION REASONS

01:28:32.607 --> 01:28:34.208
AROUND SIMPLICITY AROUND GOOD

01:28:34.275 --> 01:28:36.244
PUBLIC POLICY MADE SENSE TO

01:28:36.310 --> 01:28:36.878
CONFORM WATCHED.

01:28:36.944 --> 01:28:37.845
SOME THOSE PROVISIONS RAISE

01:28:37.912 --> 01:28:39.914
REVENUE -- SOME OF THOSE COSTS

01:28:39.981 --> 01:28:41.382
REVENUE IN PARTICULAR ONE

01:28:41.449 --> 01:28:43.184
RELATED -- TO IMPROVING THE

01:28:43.251 --> 01:28:44.786
CLIMATE FOR SMALL BUSINESSES AND

01:28:44.852 --> 01:28:46.854
HOW THEY ACCOUNT -- BUT OVERALL

01:28:46.921 --> 01:28:48.022
THE PROVISIONS RAISE ENOUGH

01:28:48.089 --> 01:28:50.892
REVENUE. TO EXPAND THE EARNED

01:28:50.958 --> 01:28:51.759
INCOME TAX CREDIT AT THE STATE

01:28:51.826 --> 01:28:53.961
LEVEL AND WE SHOULD POINT OUT

01:28:54.028 --> 01:28:54.729
THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ASO

01:28:54.796 --> 01:28:56.164
HAS AN EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT

01:28:56.230 --> 01:28:57.799
WHICH IS MUCH MORE GENEROUS ON

01:28:57.865 --> 01:29:00.735
THE WHOLE AND SO WE VIEW THIS AS

01:29:00.802 --> 01:29:02.103
GOING IN THAT DIRECTION AS WELL.

01:29:02.170 --> 01:29:07.275
AND WILL THAT TAX CONFORMITY

01:29:07.341 --> 01:29:09.944
COME THROUGH A TRAILER BILL.

01:29:10.011 --> 01:29:10.978
HAVE YET TO RECEIVE RESERVE

01:29:11.045 --> 01:29:11.546
TRAILER BILLS YES THOSE ARE

01:29:11.612 --> 01:29:13.347
POSTED.

01:29:13.414 --> 01:29:14.415
YES SO WE'LL GO THROUGH

01:29:14.482 --> 01:29:15.983
GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE.

01:29:16.050 --> 01:29:17.118
WE WE SEE ADDRESSING THIS FOR

01:29:17.185 --> 01:29:18.352
THAT BUDGET PROCESS IS THE RIGHT

01:29:18.419 --> 01:29:19.487
APPROACH THANK YOU THANK YOU

THANK YOU -- I THINK THERE'S

01:29:23.991 --> 01:29:24.659
BEEN NOTED THE THE BIG

01:29:24.726 --> 01:29:25.760
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE HOUSES IN

01:29:25.827 --> 01:29:27.595
THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IS THE

01:29:27.662 --> 01:29:29.464
ADVANCE PAYMENTS.

01:29:29.530 --> 01:29:30.765
AND I THINK THERE ARE SOME OF A

01:29:30.832 --> 01:29:32.667
LEGITIMATE ISSUES THAT OBVIOUSLY

01:29:32.734 --> 01:29:33.501
SHOULD STILL BE TALKED ABOUT ON

01:29:33.568 --> 01:29:34.635
THAT.

01:29:34.702 --> 01:29:36.738
BUT I WANTED TO SPEAK -- TO I

01:29:36.804 --> 01:29:38.239

01:29:38.306 --> 01:29:41.209
EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT AND I

01:29:41.275 --> 01:29:46.748
ALSO WAS -- THE BOTH HOUSES HAVE

01:29:46.814 --> 01:29:49.050
BEEN HAVE RECOMMENDED THAT WE

01:29:49.117 --> 01:29:50.685
INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF FINDING

01:29:50.752 --> 01:29:54.489
THAT WE UTILIZE. TO DO OUTREACH

01:29:54.555 --> 01:29:57.325
AND ACTUALLY TO ASSIST PEOPLE.

01:29:57.391 --> 01:30:02.830
IN SUBMITTING PREPARING A TAX --

01:30:02.897 --> 01:30:03.898
SUBMITTING TAX BECAUSE AS WE

01:30:03.965 --> 01:30:04.899
KNOW.

01:30:04.966 --> 01:30:08.069
A NUMBER OF HOUSEHOLDS THAT.

01:30:08.136 --> 01:30:09.637
WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR EARNED

01:30:09.704 --> 01:30:11.806
INCOME TAX CREDIT AND THAT ARE

01:30:11.873 --> 01:30:13.641
ELIGIBLE EVEN FOR THE FEDERAL.

01:30:13.708 --> 01:30:16.277
ART REQUIRED TO FILE THEIR TAXES

01:30:16.344 --> 01:30:17.111
SO.

01:30:17.178 --> 01:30:19.080

01:30:19.147 --> 01:30:20.214
FILE.

01:30:20.281 --> 01:30:22.583
AND WERE YOU CALIFORNIA ALREADY

FEDERAL EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT

01:30:30.558 --> 01:30:32.126
BECAUSE WE HAVE.

01:30:32.193 --> 01:30:33.828
A LARGE NUMBER COMPARED TO A

01:30:33.895 --> 01:30:35.897
NUMBER OF OTHER STATES A LARGE

01:30:35.963 --> 01:30:36.964
NUMBER.

01:30:37.031 --> 01:30:38.666
OF RESIDENTS WHO DON'T TAKE

01:30:38.733 --> 01:30:41.836
ADVANTAGE OF IT SO CLEARLY GIVEN

01:30:41.903 --> 01:30:43.371
THAT THE PURPOSE OF THE PROGRAM.

01:30:43.437 --> 01:30:46.340
IS TO ASSIST THOSE RESIDENTS AND

01:30:46.407 --> 01:30:49.010
TO REDUCE THE BURDEN ON OTHER --

01:30:49.076 --> 01:30:50.745
SOCIAL SERVICES THAT WE MAY BE

01:30:50.812 --> 01:30:53.915
PROVIDING THE MORE WE CAN DO TO

01:30:53.981 --> 01:30:56.918
ASSIST RESIDENTS APPLY FOR BOTH

01:30:56.984 --> 01:30:58.920

01:31:01.422 --> 01:31:02.223
THE BETTER.

01:31:02.290 --> 01:31:04.225
IN I KNOW THAT I THINK IT'S I

01:31:04.292 --> 01:31:05.059
HAVEN'T LOOKED AT THE RESEARCH

01:31:05.126 --> 01:31:07.361
RECENTLY BUT A FEW YEARS BACK

01:31:07.428 --> 01:31:09.263

HAD THE HIGHEST -- PARTICIPATION

01:31:13.701 --> 01:31:15.837
IN THE FEDERAL EARNED INCOME TAX

01:31:15.903 --> 01:31:17.205
CREDIT OF ANY OTHER STATE AND

IT WAS A STATE GOAL. TO ENSURE

01:31:23.544 --> 01:31:24.712
THAT.

ALL RESIDENTS ELIGIBLE APPLIED

01:31:26.848 --> 01:31:28.649

01:31:28.716 --> 01:31:29.317
THING FOR CALIFORNIA'S CONSIDER

01:31:29.383 --> 01:31:31.986

01:33:00.641 --> 01:33:02.376
ACTUALLY GET SOMETHING A BENEFIT

01:33:02.443 --> 01:33:03.311
FROM THAT SO THAT MAYBE THERE

01:33:03.377 --> 01:33:04.645
ISN'T OTHER GOVERNMENTAL

01:33:04.712 --> 01:33:06.714
PROGRAMS -- THAT THEY RECEIVE

01:33:06.781 --> 01:33:09.283
RECEIVE ASSISTANCE ON AS THE ONE

01:33:09.350 --> 01:33:10.318
THING I STRUGGLED.

01:33:10.384 --> 01:33:12.887
WITH THE WIND -- THE IDEA OF THE

01:33:12.954 --> 01:33:14.088
I. T. A. N. CAME UP -- IN

01:33:14.155 --> 01:33:15.356
REVENUE TAX.

01:33:15.423 --> 01:33:16.657
ABOUT BECAUSE I THOUGHT TO

01:33:16.724 --> 01:33:17.858
MYSELF YOU THESE ARE --

01:33:17.925 --> 01:33:18.759
INDIVIDUALS THAT LIVE HERE IN

01:33:18.826 --> 01:33:19.961
THE STATE IN THERE THE WORKING

01:33:20.027 --> 01:33:21.862
WE WANT THEM TO BE ABLE TO WORK

01:33:21.929 --> 01:33:23.464
BUT WE DON'T KNOW HOW LONG.

01:33:23.531 --> 01:33:25.800
THAT THAT THESE FOLKS ARE ARE

01:33:25.866 --> 01:33:27.535
GOING TO BE HERE ON IN NOT IN

01:33:27.601 --> 01:33:28.202
THE STATE WE DON'T KNOW IF I CAN

01:33:28.269 --> 01:33:29.870
BE YOUR FOR A YEAR OR TWO YEARS

01:33:29.937 --> 01:33:30.972
OR THREE YEARS IF THEY'RE GOING

01:33:31.038 --> 01:33:32.506
TO TRY. TO GET CITIZENSHIP TO BE

01:33:32.573 --> 01:33:34.575
ABLE TO A TO STAY HERE AND AND I

01:33:34.642 --> 01:33:36.677
GUESS I'M WONDERING -- WHY THAT

01:33:36.744 --> 01:33:38.279
THE ADMINISTRATION DOESN'T

01:33:38.346 --> 01:33:42.650
SUPPORT -- AT THE THE EXPANSION --

01:33:42.717 --> 01:33:44.251
TO TO I. T. I END OF FILERS IS

01:33:44.318 --> 01:33:46.787
THAT THE REASON WHY -- WHAT

01:33:46.854 --> 01:33:47.989
WHAT'S WHAT'S THE REASON WHY THE

01:33:48.055 --> 01:33:49.323
ASSEMBLY IN THE SENATE HAVE

01:33:49.390 --> 01:33:51.292
PROPOSED IT BUT THE?

01:33:51.359 --> 01:33:52.526
BUT THE GOVERNOR BROWN HAS NOT

01:33:52.593 --> 01:33:54.795
HAS NOT PROPOSED EXPANDING AT

01:33:54.862 --> 01:33:56.964
THE ATC FILERS.

01:33:57.031 --> 01:33:58.265
ARE I T&lt;c.cyan&gt; TARIAN FILERS FOR&lt;/c&gt;

01:33:58.332 --> 01:33:59.567
THE ADMINISTRATION IT'S SIMPLY A

01:33:59.633 --> 01:34:01.268
MATTER OF COST PRESSURE ON THE

01:34:01.335 --> 01:34:02.503
GENERAL FUND.

01:34:02.570 --> 01:34:03.938
NOTHING BEYOND THAT IS THERE ANY

01:34:04.005 --> 01:34:13.080
CONCERN AT ALL BY ANY EXPANSION

01:34:13.147 --> 01:34:15.583
OF THE IN OF OF FRAUD OR OR

01:34:15.649 --> 01:34:19.353
ABUSE AT ALL.

01:34:19.420 --> 01:34:20.554
YEAH -- SO IT WOULD IT WOULD BE

01:34:20.621 --> 01:34:21.922
A AN ADDITIONAL WORKLOAD FOR THE

01:34:21.989 --> 01:34:23.324
FRANCHISE TAX BOARD BOTH BECAUSE

01:34:23.391 --> 01:34:24.158
BE ADDITIONAL RETURNS AND

01:34:24.225 --> 01:34:24.725
THERE'D BE SOME ADDITIONAL

01:34:24.792 --> 01:34:25.292
HURDLES TO GO THROUGH TO TO

01:34:25.359 --> 01:34:27.395
VERIFY THE THE AMOUNTS REPORTED --

01:34:27.461 --> 01:34:30.231
BUT BUT THAT'S THAT'S WHY -- I

01:34:30.297 --> 01:34:32.233
THINK THAT THAT'S WHY -- I THINK

01:34:32.299 --> 01:34:33.367
IS THE ASSEMBLY THAT THAT ADDED

01:34:33.434 --> 01:34:34.635
A COUPLE MILLION DOLLARS TO HAVE

01:34:34.702 --> 01:34:37.805
TO BE TO TO HANDLES RETURNS I

01:34:37.872 --> 01:34:39.040
DON'T THINK THAT IT WOULD BE AS

01:34:39.106 --> 01:34:41.075
SIGNIFICANT CHANGE.

01:34:41.142 --> 01:34:41.876
IN.

01:34:41.942 --> 01:34:42.843
OR OR SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM IN

01:34:42.910 --> 01:34:44.278
TERMS OF IMPROPER PAYMENTS DO WE

01:34:44.345 --> 01:34:46.280
KNOW WHAT THE COST THE TOTAL

01:34:46.347 --> 01:34:48.482
COST WOULD BE -- FOR EXPANDING

01:34:48.549 --> 01:34:51.385
THAT THE THE THE A. T. C. T. I.

01:34:51.452 --> 01:34:54.455
TAN FOLLOW FILERS TO KNOW WHAT

01:34:54.522 --> 01:34:57.725
THE EXACT NUMBER IS.

01:34:57.792 --> 01:34:58.826
SURE SO -- WE DON'T -- WE DON'T

01:34:58.893 --> 01:34:59.460
KNOW THE EXACT COST WOULD SPIN

01:34:59.527 --> 01:35:00.561
ESTIMATED BY THE FRANCHISE TAX

01:35:00.628 --> 01:35:01.595
BOARD AND SO FOR THE SENATE

01:35:01.662 --> 01:35:03.464
PROPOSAL I BELIEVE IT'S ONE

01:35:03.531 --> 01:35:04.098
HUNDRED AND SIXTY EIGHT MILLION

01:35:04.165 --> 01:35:06.033
DOLLARS.

01:35:06.100 --> 01:35:08.135
AND FOR THE ASSEMBLY IT'S IT'S

01:35:08.202 --> 01:35:09.336
LESS THAN THAT BUT WHAT I DON'T

01:35:09.403 --> 01:35:10.171
KNOW IT'S IT'S IT'S ABOUT A

01:35:10.237 --> 01:35:11.205
HUNDRED MILLION AND IS THERE

01:35:11.272 --> 01:35:15.509
BEEN ANY ANALYSIS AT ALL DONE ON

01:35:15.576 --> 01:35:16.877
FOLKS IT WOULD BE RECEIVING THAT

01:35:16.944 --> 01:35:18.345
EA T. C..

01:35:18.412 --> 01:35:20.948
THAT THERE WOULD BE -- SOME A

01:35:21.015 --> 01:35:22.450
CALL IT A RETURN ON INVESTMENT

01:35:22.516 --> 01:35:24.351
IF YOU WILL FOR FOLKS THAT ARE

01:35:24.418 --> 01:35:25.786
RECEIVING THAT AT THAT KNOWING

01:35:25.853 --> 01:35:27.555
THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE HERE

01:35:27.621 --> 01:35:28.689
AND OVER TIME BEING THAT PAYING

01:35:28.756 --> 01:35:31.392
TAXES TO BE ABLE TO RECOVER.

01:35:31.459 --> 01:35:32.393
AT THAT AMOUNT IS THEIR BEEN ANY

01:35:32.460 --> 01:35:34.728
ANALYSIS AT ALL THAT IN PAYING

01:35:34.795 --> 01:35:36.530
THAT -- THAT GIVING THEM THAT D.

01:35:36.597 --> 01:35:37.665
A. T. C. THAT THEY'LL BE WORKING

01:35:37.731 --> 01:35:38.933
HERE AND PAYING A CERTAIN AMOUNT

01:35:38.999 --> 01:35:41.168
OF TAXES -- AFTERWARDS OR IS IT

01:35:41.235 --> 01:35:43.270
JUST -- IT IS IT JUST I DON'T

01:35:43.337 --> 01:35:44.805
USE THE TERM HAND OUT BUT THE

01:35:44.872 --> 01:35:46.774
AGAIN THE GOAL OF THIS IS A TO

01:35:46.841 --> 01:35:48.843
INCENTIVIZE -- TO INCENTIVIZE

01:35:48.909 --> 01:35:50.611
WORK THAT'S WHAT THE ATC WAS WAS

01:35:50.678 --> 01:35:51.745
ALL ABOUT AND IT SEEMS LIKE

01:35:51.812 --> 01:35:55.916
WOULD BE EXPANDING A LITTLE

01:35:55.983 --> 01:35:57.618
FURTHER BEYOND BEYOND THAT.

01:35:57.685 --> 01:35:58.219
THE THE STRUCTURE THE ATC IS

01:35:58.285 --> 01:35:59.320
SUCH THAT AS YOU INCREASE THE

01:35:59.386 --> 01:36:00.554
NUMBER OF HOURS WORKED THE THE

01:36:00.621 --> 01:36:02.056
THE CREDIT GROWS UP TO A CERTAIN

01:36:02.123 --> 01:36:04.225
POINT IN THAT PHASE IT PHASES

01:36:04.291 --> 01:36:04.792
OUT SO THERE'S NOT A A CLIFF

01:36:04.859 --> 01:36:05.259
AFFECT.

01:36:05.326 --> 01:36:06.360
THE RIGHT NO BRIGHT BUT THAT

01:36:06.427 --> 01:36:07.428
THAT'S ACTUALLY PART OF THE GOAL

01:36:07.495 --> 01:36:09.230
IS TO TO GET THEM TO BE ABLE TO

01:36:09.296 --> 01:36:10.598
TO WORK MORE SO THAT THE MORE

01:36:10.664 --> 01:36:11.232
THAT THEY WORK THE MORE THAT

01:36:11.298 --> 01:36:12.099
THEY MAKE.

01:36:12.166 --> 01:36:13.367
A RIGHT THAT THAT ACTUALLY

01:36:13.434 --> 01:36:14.568
STARTS TO TAKE YOUR TO YOUR DOWN

01:36:14.635 --> 01:36:15.836
A LITTLE BIT BUT IT WOULD MAKE

01:36:15.903 --> 01:36:17.671
SENSE OF OUR EXPANDING THIS THAT

01:36:17.738 --> 01:36:17.972
WOULD WANT.

01:36:18.038 --> 01:36:19.073
TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE

01:42:34.281 --> 01:42:36.149
TITLE BUT IT SEEMS LIKE THE

01:42:36.216 --> 01:42:37.451
CONCEPT IS SIMILAR JUST BECAUSE

01:42:37.518 --> 01:42:38.785
IT IS AN REGULATED AYE.

01:42:38.852 --> 01:42:40.254

THESE ARE TWO FAIRLY BIG PICTURE

01:43:30.671 --> 01:43:33.040
ISSUES AND ALSO BIG IN DOLLAR

01:43:33.106 --> 01:43:34.775

ABOUT BUDGET RESERVES OVERALL

RESPECT TO DEBT AND LIABILITY

01:43:42.549 --> 01:43:43.617
SO STARTING WITH BUDGET RESERVES

01:43:43.684 --> 01:43:45.419
ON THE FIRST PAGE.

01:43:45.485 --> 01:43:47.387
THE TABLE OF THE TOP SHOWS THE

01:43:47.454 --> 01:43:48.522
TOTAL RESERVES THAT WOULD BE

01:43:48.589 --> 01:43:50.357
ENACTED UNDER EACH OF THE THREE

01:43:50.424 --> 01:43:51.358
PACKAGES.

01:43:51.425 --> 01:43:52.459
AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THE TOTALS

01:43:52.526 --> 01:43:53.760
THE ASSEMBLY WITH AN AXE THE

01:43:53.827 --> 01:43:55.662
HIGHEST LEVEL OF RESERVES AT

01:43:55.729 --> 01:43:57.364
TWENTY ONE BILLION WHILE THE

01:43:57.431 --> 01:44:00.133
GOVERNOR'S TOTAL RESERVE LEVEL

01:44:00.200 --> 01:44:00.667
BE SLIGHTLY LOWER THAN THE

01:44:00.734 --> 01:44:03.470
SILENCE -- WITHIN THIS TOTAL

01:44:03.537 --> 01:44:06.106
THERE ARE FOUR DIFFERENT NOTABLE

01:44:06.173 --> 01:44:07.774
RESERVE ACCOUNTS -- WHICH WOULD

01:44:07.841 --> 01:44:09.009
EACH RECEIVE DIFFERENT AMOUNTS

01:44:09.076 --> 01:44:10.243
INTO THE DIFFERENT PACKAGES

01:44:10.310 --> 01:44:12.212
ALTHOUGH THE THREE PACKAGES

01:44:12.279 --> 01:44:13.714
THERE ARE FAIRLY SIMILAR FOR THE

01:44:13.780 --> 01:44:15.349
BSA THE STATE'S CONSTITUTIONAL

01:44:15.415 --> 01:44:16.316
RESERVE.

01:44:16.383 --> 01:44:17.684
THE ASSEMBLY WOULD ENACT A

01:44:17.751 --> 01:44:19.720
HIGHER LEVEL OF THE SFU THE

01:44:19.786 --> 01:44:21.021
STATE'S DISCRETIONARY RESERVE

01:44:21.088 --> 01:44:22.122
AND THE SENATE PUTS AN

01:44:22.189 --> 01:44:23.624
ADDITIONAL DEPOSIT OF SIX

01:44:23.690 --> 01:44:25.058
HUNDRED MILLION INTO THE SAFETY

01:44:25.125 --> 01:44:26.793
NET RESERVE WHICH IS FOR MEDI

01:44:26.860 --> 01:44:28.128
CAL AND CAL WORKS.

01:44:28.195 --> 01:44:29.262
JUST TO GIVE A LITTLE CONTEXT

01:44:29.329 --> 01:44:30.631
AROUND THESE NUMBERS OUR OFFICE

01:44:30.697 --> 01:44:32.899
IS ESTIMATED THAT ABOUT TWENTY

01:44:32.966 --> 01:44:33.634
TO FORTY BILLION DOLLARS IN

01:44:33.700 --> 01:44:35.335
RESERVES WOULD BE NEEDED. FOR

01:44:35.402 --> 01:44:36.870
THE STATE TO COVER AT B. COSTS

01:44:36.937 --> 01:44:38.538
ASSOCIATED WITH A MILD TO

01:44:38.605 --> 01:44:40.307
MODERATE RECESSION ASSUMING THAT

01:44:40.374 --> 01:44:41.575
THE LEGISLATURE DIDN'T WANT TO

01:44:41.642 --> 01:44:43.644
CUT PROGRAMS OR OTHER SPENDING

01:44:43.710 --> 01:44:46.013
RAISE REVENUES ARE SHIFT COSTS

01:44:46.079 --> 01:44:46.780
OTHER ENTITIES.

01:44:46.847 --> 01:44:48.348
NOTABLY THE ASSEMBLY ALSO

01:44:48.415 --> 01:44:50.217
CREATED A DISASTER ACCOUNT IT

01:44:50.283 --> 01:44:51.318
DOESN'T APPEAR IN THIS TABLE

01:44:51.385 --> 01:44:53.286
BECAUSE THERE'S NO BALANCE IN IT

01:44:53.353 --> 01:44:55.255
YET -- BUT WE WOULD ADD THAT

01:44:55.322 --> 01:44:57.324
THERE ARE TWO POTENTIAL MERITS

01:44:57.391 --> 01:44:58.792
ASSOCIATED WITH CREATING SUCH AN

01:44:58.859 --> 01:44:59.860
ACCOUNT.

01:44:59.926 --> 01:45:01.595
FIRST IT WOULD ALLOW THE STATE

01:45:01.662 --> 01:45:03.463
TO SORT OF SEPARATELY MENTALLY

01:45:03.530 --> 01:45:05.198
ACCOUNT FOR THE COSTS ASSOCIATED

01:45:05.265 --> 01:45:06.767
WITH THE RECESSION VERSES A

01:45:06.833 --> 01:45:07.601
DISASTER.

01:45:07.668 --> 01:45:09.903
WHICH COULD BOTH BE SIZEABLE AND

01:45:09.970 --> 01:45:11.638
COULD OCCUR SIMULTANEOUSLY AND

01:45:11.705 --> 01:45:12.873
PERHAPS IT MAKES SENSE FOR THE

01:45:12.939 --> 01:45:14.675
STATE TO SAY FOR BOTH AT THE

01:45:14.741 --> 01:45:15.676
SAME TIME.

01:45:15.742 --> 01:45:16.476
THE SECOND IS THAT IT COULD

01:45:16.543 --> 01:45:17.644
POTENTIALLY CREATE MORE

01:45:17.711 --> 01:45:19.312
TRANSPARENCY FOR THE STATE IF

01:45:19.379 --> 01:45:20.747
IT'S A SINGLE ACCOUNT WHERE.

01:45:20.814 --> 01:45:22.082
A REIMBURSEMENT FROM THE FEDERAL

01:45:22.149 --> 01:45:23.650
GOVERNMENT COULD BE DEPOSITED IN

01:45:23.717 --> 01:45:24.918
ALL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH A

01:45:24.985 --> 01:45:26.653
DISASTER RESPONSE AND RECOVERY

01:45:26.720 --> 01:45:28.889
COULD BE -- ALLOCATED FROM THAT

01:45:28.955 --> 01:45:30.424
POTENTIALLY ALLOWS THE

01:45:30.490 --> 01:45:32.125
LEGISLATURE A LEVERAGE POINT --

01:45:32.192 --> 01:45:35.262
TO USE FOR MORE OVERSIGHT OVER

01:45:35.328 --> 01:45:37.064
DISASTER COSTS.

01:45:37.130 --> 01:45:39.232
ALL TURN TO THE NEXT PAGE WHICH

01:45:39.299 --> 01:45:42.302
GIVES A AND BROAD OVERVIEW OF

01:45:42.369 --> 01:45:43.870
THE DEBT MY ABILITY PACKAGES

01:45:43.937 --> 01:45:46.039
ASSOCIATED WITH -- THE GOVERNOR

01:45:46.106 --> 01:45:47.541
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY I WON'T GO

01:45:47.607 --> 01:45:48.675
THROUGH ALL OF THESE NUMBERS IN

01:45:48.742 --> 01:45:50.610
DETAIL JUST WANT TO GIVE SOME

01:45:50.677 --> 01:45:52.446
HIGH LEVEL -- COMMENTS ABOUT

01:45:52.512 --> 01:45:54.014
SOME TRADE OFFS ASSOCIATED WITH

01:45:54.081 --> 01:45:55.449
THESE FIGURES.

01:45:55.515 --> 01:45:57.050
SO THEY'RE ESSENTIALLY TWO TRADE

01:45:57.117 --> 01:45:57.851
OFFS THAT ARE OUTLINED BY THIS

01:45:57.918 --> 01:45:59.853
TABLE THE FIRST IS A QUESTION OF

01:45:59.920 --> 01:46:01.822
PAYING OFF STATE LIABILITIES

01:46:01.888 --> 01:46:02.923
VERSUS PAYING OFF LIABILITIES

01:46:02.989 --> 01:46:04.725
ASSOCIATED WITH OTHER ENTITIES

01:46:04.791 --> 01:46:06.293
LIKE SAY SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND

01:46:06.359 --> 01:46:08.028
UNIVERSITIES IN THIS CASE.

01:46:08.095 --> 01:46:08.762
AND THE SECOND HEARD OFFICE

01:46:08.829 --> 01:46:09.796
BETWEEN THE PAYING OFF

01:46:09.863 --> 01:46:11.164
RETIREMENT LIABILITIES WITH

01:46:11.231 --> 01:46:13.366
PAYING OFF BUDGETARY LIABILITIES.

01:46:13.433 --> 01:46:15.268
WITH RESPECT TO THE STATE VERSUS

01:46:15.335 --> 01:46:16.203
SCHOOL DISTRICTS.

01:46:16.269 --> 01:46:17.471
SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS TOWARDS

01:46:17.537 --> 01:46:19.406
THE STATE LIABILITIES TO IMPROVE

01:46:19.473 --> 01:46:21.041
THE STATE'S BUDGET BOTTOM LINE

01:46:21.108 --> 01:46:22.676
OVER TIME SO SAY IN A FEW

01:46:22.743 --> 01:46:23.777
BILLION DOLLARS OF STATE

01:46:23.844 --> 01:46:25.145
PAYMENTS TODAY WOULD REDUCE

01:46:25.212 --> 01:46:26.446
STATE COSTS BY HUNDREDS OF

01:46:26.513 --> 01:46:27.614
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OVER TIME

01:46:27.681 --> 01:46:28.615
GIVING THE STATE ADDITIONAL

01:46:28.682 --> 01:46:29.783
CAPACITY.

01:46:29.850 --> 01:46:33.286
TO USE THOSE RESOURCES FOR OTHER

01:46:33.353 --> 01:46:34.521
PURPOSES.

01:46:34.588 --> 01:46:35.455
STRICT LIABILITY IS BY CONTRAST

01:46:35.522 --> 01:46:36.289
DON'T HAVE THIS POSITIVE EFFECT

01:46:36.356 --> 01:46:37.224
FOR THE STATE BUDGET CLEARLY BUT

01:46:37.290 --> 01:46:38.391
IT DOES HAVE THIS POSITIVE

01:46:38.458 --> 01:46:39.926
AFFECT FOR DISTRICT BUDGETS.

01:46:39.993 --> 01:46:42.262
AND SINCE THE STATE DOES HAVE A

01:46:42.329 --> 01:46:44.498
INCENTIVE TO IN TO ENSURE THAT

01:46:44.564 --> 01:46:45.699
THERE'S GOOD PHYSICAL HEALTH

01:46:45.766 --> 01:46:47.367
AMONG DISTRICTS AND THIS ALSO

01:46:47.434 --> 01:46:49.636
MAKES ON THE SECOND TURN

01:46:49.703 --> 01:46:50.670
OPPOSITION RETIREMENT

01:46:50.737 --> 01:46:52.205
LIABILITIES VERSES BUDGETARY

01:46:52.272 --> 01:46:53.373
LIABILITIES.

01:46:53.440 --> 01:46:54.541
IN GENERAL YOU KNOW THERE'S A

01:46:54.608 --> 01:46:55.776
LOT OF DIFFERENCES HERE BUT JUST

01:46:55.842 --> 01:46:57.244
TO BOIL IT DOWN TO ONE IMPORTANT

01:46:57.310 --> 01:46:58.345
ONE IS YOUR CONSIDERING THESE

01:46:58.411 --> 01:46:59.513
FINAL PACKAGES.

01:46:59.579 --> 01:47:01.381
RETIREMENT LIABILITIES TEND TO

01:47:01.448 --> 01:47:02.883
CARRY MUCH HIGHER INTEREST RATES

01:47:02.949 --> 01:47:04.751
AND SO BY PAYING OFF RETIREMENT

01:47:04.818 --> 01:47:07.120
LIABILITIES SOONER THE STATE CAN

01:47:07.187 --> 01:47:10.056
SAVE MORE MONEY OVER TIME.

01:47:10.123 --> 01:47:11.958
YOU'LL NOTICE THAT THE GOVERNOR

01:47:12.025 --> 01:47:15.128
AND THE SENATE MOSTLY FOCUS.

01:47:15.195 --> 01:47:16.630
MOSTLY FOCUS ON STATE PAYMENTS

01:47:16.696 --> 01:47:17.831
AND HAVE A SIMILAR MIX BETWEEN

01:47:17.898 --> 01:47:18.799
RETIREMENT AND BUDGETARY

01:47:18.865 --> 01:47:21.101
LIABILITIES THE ASSEMBLY PLACES

01:47:21.168 --> 01:47:22.269
SOME ADDITIONAL MONEY TOWARD

01:47:22.335 --> 01:47:24.037
DISTRICT UNFUNDED LIABILITIES

01:47:24.104 --> 01:47:25.238
AND I'M NOT TALK ABOUT.

01:47:25.305 --> 01:47:27.507
ODD STATE PAYMENTS FOR DISTRICT

01:47:27.574 --> 01:47:29.643
COSTS ON THE NEXT PAGE.

01:47:29.709 --> 01:47:31.912
SO THE THIRD PAGE TO SHOWS THE

01:47:31.978 --> 01:47:33.680
PAYMENTS EACH EACH OF THESE

01:47:33.747 --> 01:47:36.249
PLANS WOULD MAKE TOWARDS -- SEAT.

01:47:36.316 --> 01:47:37.951
SARS TOWARD SCHOOL DISTRICT AND

01:47:38.018 --> 01:47:40.654
COMMUNITY COLLEGES PENSION COSTS.

01:47:40.720 --> 01:47:41.822
IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT THERE'S

01:47:41.888 --> 01:47:43.857
TWO TYPES OF PAYMENTS HERE AND

01:47:43.924 --> 01:47:45.058
TWO TYPES OF PENSION PLANS HERE

01:47:45.125 --> 01:47:46.193
US IS ALREADY BEEN GIVES COSTING

01:47:46.259 --> 01:47:47.027
CONFERENCE.

01:47:47.093 --> 01:47:48.995
THE TWO TYPES OF PAYMENTS ARE

01:47:49.062 --> 01:47:50.697
RATE RELIEF WHICH IS MORE AKIN

01:47:50.764 --> 01:47:52.632
TO PAYING SOMEONE'S MORTGAGE ON

01:47:52.699 --> 01:47:53.400
THEIR BEHALF FOR A COUPLE MONTHS

01:47:53.466 --> 01:47:54.067
SAY.

01:47:54.134 --> 01:47:55.468
AND UNFUNDED LIABILITIES WHICH

01:47:55.535 --> 01:47:58.839
IS MORE CAN TO PAYING DOWN THE

01:47:58.905 --> 01:47:59.472
MORTGAGE PRINCIPLE ON SOMEONE'S

01:47:59.539 --> 01:48:00.307
HOUSE.

01:48:00.373 --> 01:48:01.441
THEN THERE'S ALSO TWO TYPES OF

01:48:01.508 --> 01:48:02.442
PENSION SYSTEMS.

01:48:02.509 --> 01:48:03.677
ARE THE GOVERNOR FOCUSES

01:48:03.743 --> 01:48:05.712
PAYMENTS ON THE CAL STIRS SYSTEM

01:48:05.779 --> 01:48:08.048
WHICH IS THE STATE PENSION

01:48:08.114 --> 01:48:09.683
SYSTEM FOR CERTIFIED TO STATE

01:48:09.749 --> 01:48:11.184
CERTIFIED EMPLOYEES LIKE

01:48:11.251 --> 01:48:12.619
TEACHERS AND ADMINISTRATORS.

01:48:12.686 --> 01:48:14.120
BUT BOTH OF THE HOUSES ALSO

01:48:14.187 --> 01:48:15.355
ALLOCATE ADDITIONAL FUNDING

01:48:15.422 --> 01:48:17.357
TOWARD THE CALPERS SYSTEM WHICH

01:48:17.424 --> 01:48:19.926
IS THE SYSTEM -- IN THIS CONTEXT

01:48:19.993 --> 01:48:21.228
FOR SCHOOL DISTRICT EMPLOYEES

01:48:21.294 --> 01:48:22.128
THAT ARE NOT STATE CERTIFIED

01:48:22.195 --> 01:48:24.397
LIKE A CAFETERIA WORKERS ARE BUS

01:48:24.464 --> 01:48:26.633
DRIVERS. ONE FINAL DISTINCTION

01:48:26.700 --> 01:48:28.235
BETWEEN THE TWO HOUSES IS THAT

01:48:28.301 --> 01:48:29.669
THE ASSEMBLY PROVIDES ADDITIONAL

01:48:29.736 --> 01:48:31.004
AMOUNTS FOR PAYING DOWN THE

01:48:31.071 --> 01:48:32.706
UNFUNDED LIABILITY ASSOCIATED

01:48:32.772 --> 01:48:34.207
WITH YOU THE SCHOOL DISTRICT

01:48:34.274 --> 01:48:35.909
CALPERS COST WHEREAS THE SENATE

01:48:35.976 --> 01:48:38.178
JUST ARGUMENTS THE RATE RELIEF

01:48:38.245 --> 01:48:40.513
ON BOTH SIDES.

01:48:40.580 --> 01:48:42.415
BE YOU THE QUESTION OF OF RATE

01:48:42.482 --> 01:48:44.150
RELIEF FORCES UNFUNDED LIABILITY

01:48:44.217 --> 01:48:45.518
IS REALLY A QUESTION OF SHORT

01:48:45.585 --> 01:48:47.687
TERM VERSUS LONG TERM IN THE

01:48:47.754 --> 01:48:49.055
RIGHT RELIEF CASE ADDITIONAL

01:48:49.122 --> 01:48:51.091
PAYMENTS CAN PROVIDE DOLLAR FOR

01:48:51.157 --> 01:48:52.459
DOLLAR SAVINGS FOR SCHOOL

01:48:52.525 --> 01:48:53.927
DISTRICTS TODAY AN ADDITIONAL

01:48:53.994 --> 01:48:55.795
AND MORE SAVINGS ESSENTIALLY IN

01:48:55.862 --> 01:48:56.730
THE SHORT TERM.

01:48:56.796 --> 01:48:58.298
BUT UNFUNDED LIABILITY PAYMENTS

01:48:58.365 --> 01:48:59.900
PROVIDE THE LOWER AMOUNTS OF

01:48:59.966 --> 01:49:01.768
SAVINGS BUT OVER TIME IT ALSO

01:49:01.835 --> 01:49:04.738
pDOLLAR SAVINGS SO.

01:49:04.804 --> 01:49:06.239
SETTING ASIDE A COUPLE BILLION

01:49:06.306 --> 01:49:08.141
OF DOLLARS WOULD SAVE SAY TWO TO

01:49:08.208 --> 01:49:09.609
THREE DOLLARS FOR SCHOOL

01:49:09.676 --> 01:49:11.211
DISTRICTS OVERTIME VERSES ONE

01:49:11.278 --> 01:49:13.580
DOLLAR -- FOR RATE RELIEF

01:49:13.647 --> 01:49:13.880
[inaudible]

01:49:13.947 --> 01:49:18.752
THANKS.

01:49:18.818 --> 01:49:20.820
FINANCE THE ADMINISTRATION

01:49:20.887 --> 01:49:21.788
CONTINUES TO SUPPORT ITS MY

01:49:21.855 --> 01:49:26.159
REVISION PROPOSAL INCLUDING

01:49:26.226 --> 01:49:28.094
LIABILITIES AND WE ARE HAPPY TO

01:49:28.161 --> 01:49:30.497
DISCUSS ANY OF THE DETAILS.

01:49:30.563 --> 01:49:33.366
AND THANK YOU MEMBERS

01:49:33.433 --> 01:49:33.667
[inaudible]

01:49:33.733 --> 01:49:35.969
MR OBERNOLTE.

01:49:36.036 --> 01:49:37.704
SO I HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE

01:49:37.771 --> 01:49:39.105
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE FIRST.

01:49:39.172 --> 01:49:41.641
HI GIVEN THAT THE LA -- SAYS

01:49:41.708 --> 01:49:44.577
THAT -- IF WE INVESTED DOLLAR

01:49:44.644 --> 01:49:46.413
RATE RELIEF WE'RE SAVING A

01:49:46.479 --> 01:49:48.248
DOLLAR THIS YEAR WE INVEST A

01:49:48.315 --> 01:49:49.749
DOLLAR IN PAYING DOWN UNFUNDED

01:49:49.816 --> 01:49:51.017
LIABILITIES.

01:49:51.084 --> 01:49:53.219
THEN WE'RE SAVING TWO TO THREE

01:49:53.286 --> 01:49:54.754
DOLLARS LONG TERM.

01:49:54.821 --> 01:49:57.424
SO WHAT IS THE ADMINISTRATION'S

01:49:57.490 --> 01:50:00.327
JUSTIFICATION FOR INCLUDING THE

01:50:00.393 --> 01:50:01.127
EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION

01:50:01.194 --> 01:50:01.895
DOLLARS THAT YOU DID FOR THE

01:50:01.962 --> 01:50:03.096
STIRS.

01:50:03.163 --> 01:50:04.197
OUR RATE RELIEF AND THAT'S WHY

01:50:04.264 --> 01:50:06.466
NOT PUT THAT TOWARDS ONE UP AT

01:50:06.533 --> 01:50:07.000
ALL TOWARDS THE UNFUNDED

01:50:07.067 --> 01:50:07.701
LIABILITIES.

01:50:07.767 --> 01:50:09.102
SO WHEN WHEN IT COMES TO THE

01:50:09.169 --> 01:50:11.137
STORES REALLY SPECIFICALLY --

01:50:11.204 --> 01:50:12.505
THE OUR JUSTIFICATION FOR THAT

01:50:12.572 --> 01:50:13.873
IS TIED UP WITH THAT CAL STIRS

01:50:13.940 --> 01:50:15.642
FUNDING PLAN -- WHICH IS A VERY

01:50:15.709 --> 01:50:18.478
COMPLICATED PIECE OF LEGISLATION --

01:50:18.545 --> 01:50:20.647
BUT LONG STORY SHORT THE RATES

01:50:20.714 --> 01:50:22.349
FOR THE NEXT TWO YEARS ARE SET

01:50:22.415 --> 01:50:25.151
BY STATUTE AND SO THE WAY THAT

01:50:25.218 --> 01:50:26.119
WE DECIDE TO STRUCTURE IT WHICH

01:50:26.186 --> 01:50:27.554
I BELIEVE IS SIMILAR IN SOME

01:50:27.620 --> 01:50:29.723
WAYS TO THE WAY THAT BOTH HOUSES.

01:50:29.789 --> 01:50:31.391
STRUCTURE THEIR OWN PROPOSALS IS

01:50:31.458 --> 01:50:32.926
TO SAY FOR THESE NEXT TWO YEARS

01:50:32.993 --> 01:50:34.394
WHICH ARE GOVERNED IN VERY

01:50:34.461 --> 01:50:36.096
SPECIFIC WAYS BY THAT PLANNED.

01:50:36.162 --> 01:50:37.130
OUT WE WILL GIVE WHAT WAS

01:50:37.197 --> 01:50:38.932
INITIALLY -- GOVERNOR'S BUDGET

01:50:38.999 --> 01:50:39.566
THREE HUNDRED FIFTY NINE DOLLARS

01:50:39.632 --> 01:50:41.534
PER YEAR NOW IN THE NAY REVISION

01:50:41.601 --> 01:50:42.836
FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN

01:50:42.902 --> 01:50:44.104
THE FIRST YEAR AND THREE HUNDRED

01:50:44.170 --> 01:50:44.471
FIFTY MILLION.

01:50:44.537 --> 01:50:45.705
IN THE SECOND YEAR AND THEN TAKE

01:50:45.772 --> 01:50:47.073
THE BALANCE WHICH IS THE VAST

01:50:47.140 --> 01:50:48.575
MAJORITY OF THE OVERALL NOW TWO

01:50:48.641 --> 01:50:50.243
POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS AND

01:50:50.310 --> 01:50:52.045
USE THAT TO BUY DOWN THE RATE

01:50:52.112 --> 01:50:53.179
OVER THE LONG TERM.

01:50:53.246 --> 01:50:54.381
AND SO YOU ARE CORRECT THAT

01:50:54.447 --> 01:50:56.249
WE'RE PROJECTING SAVINGS -- THAT

01:50:56.316 --> 01:50:58.084
ARE MORE IN THESE FIRST TWO

01:50:58.151 --> 01:50:58.918
YEARS COMPARED TO THAT BUY OUT

01:50:58.985 --> 01:51:01.054
BUT THAT BY OUT OF THE LONG TERM

01:51:01.121 --> 01:51:02.288
RATE SHOULD SAVE DISTRICTS

01:51:02.355 --> 01:51:04.224
SIGNIFICANT MONEY OVER THE

01:51:04.290 --> 01:51:05.425
COURSE OF THAT FORECAST PERIOD.

01:51:05.492 --> 01:51:07.160
SURE BUT WOULDN'T YOU SAVE MORE

01:51:07.227 --> 01:51:09.129
IF YOU PUT ALL THAT MONEY

01:51:09.195 --> 01:51:10.063
INSTEAD OF DID TO OUR RATE

01:51:10.130 --> 01:51:16.169
RELIEF PUT IT ALL TOWARDS PAYING

01:51:16.236 --> 01:51:18.338
DOWN A LONG TERM LIABILITIES.

01:51:18.405 --> 01:51:19.472
GENERALLY -- ON PRINCIPLE WOULD

01:51:19.539 --> 01:51:20.106
SAY YES BUT GIVEN THE

01:51:20.173 --> 01:51:21.007
COMPLEXITIES OF THE CAL STARS

01:51:21.074 --> 01:51:21.741
FUNDING PLAN I WOULD WANT TO

01:51:21.808 --> 01:51:23.276
CHECK BACK ON THAT BEFORE BEFORE

01:51:23.343 --> 01:51:23.576
CONFIRMING.

01:51:23.643 --> 01:51:24.577
OKAY SO.

01:51:24.644 --> 01:51:26.713
THE YOU DID NOT PROPOSE OWEVER

01:51:26.780 --> 01:51:28.248
PUTTING ANY OF THE MONEY.

01:51:28.314 --> 01:51:29.849
ON PERS THE PER SIDE TOWARDS

01:51:29.916 --> 01:51:32.252
RATE RELIEF BUT THE ASSEMBLY DID

01:51:32.318 --> 01:51:33.386
SO WHAT WAS YOUR JUSTIFICATION

01:51:33.453 --> 01:51:35.221
AND DOING T FOR STARTERS AND

01:51:35.288 --> 01:51:36.523
NOT FOR PERS.

01:51:36.589 --> 01:51:37.657
SERVICES SPECIFICALLY FOR

01:51:37.724 --> 01:51:38.725
SCHOOLS BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE DID

01:51:38.792 --> 01:51:39.926
HAVE A SUPPLEMENTAL CALPERS

01:51:39.993 --> 01:51:41.327
PAYMENT GENERALLY ON BEHALF OF

01:51:41.394 --> 01:51:43.129
THE STATE WHEN IT COMES TO THE

01:51:43.196 --> 01:51:44.297
SCHOOL PAYMENT -- THE

01:51:44.364 --> 01:51:45.999
ADMINISTRATION SENSE WAS THAT

01:51:46.066 --> 01:51:48.268
CAL STIRS HAS A LARGE --

01:51:48.334 --> 01:51:50.003
UNFUNDED LIABILITY COMPARED TO

01:51:50.070 --> 01:51:51.905
THE CALPERS SCHOOLS POOL AND IN

01:51:51.971 --> 01:51:54.674
ADDITION -- HISTORICALLY FOR CAL

01:51:54.741 --> 01:51:55.875
STAR IS THE STATE AND THE

01:51:55.942 --> 01:51:57.544
SCHOOLS HAVE SHARED

01:51:57.610 --> 01:51:58.945
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT

01:51:59.012 --> 01:52:00.647
LIABILITY AND EACH STATE VERSUS

01:52:00.713 --> 01:52:02.649
SCHOOL SHARE HAS CHANGED OVER

01:52:02.715 --> 01:52:03.817
TIME MOST RECENTLY IN THE CAL

01:52:03.883 --> 01:52:05.118
STARS FUNDING PLAN.

01:52:05.185 --> 01:52:07.020
WERE AS FOR THAT CALPERS SCHOOLS

01:52:07.087 --> 01:52:08.955
POOL THE STATE TRADITIONALLY HAS

01:52:09.022 --> 01:52:10.990
NOT SHARED IN RESPONSIBILITY FOR

01:52:11.057 --> 01:52:12.592
THAT MY ABILITY BUT THE MOST

01:52:12.659 --> 01:52:14.394
IMPORTANT POINT IS THAT THE

01:52:14.461 --> 01:52:16.663
PURPOSE OF THIS POLICY WAS TO

01:52:16.729 --> 01:52:18.098
PROVIDE SOME RELIEF BOTH IN THE

01:52:18.164 --> 01:52:18.898
NEAR TERM.

01:52:18.965 --> 01:52:20.567
AND THE LONG TERM TO SCHOOLS AND

01:52:20.633 --> 01:52:21.935
WE BELIEVE THAT OUR CAL STARS

01:52:22.001 --> 01:52:23.903
PROPOSAL WAS ABLE TO DO THAT

01:52:23.970 --> 01:52:25.271
GIVING SCHOOLS A LITTLE BIT MORE

01:52:25.338 --> 01:52:30.276
FLEXIBILITY TO MAKE INVESTMENTS

01:52:30.343 --> 01:52:32.145
THEY NEED TO MAKE.

01:52:32.212 --> 01:52:32.645
YOU KNOW I'M I'M REALLY

01:52:32.712 --> 01:52:33.246
SUPPORTIVE OF PAYING DOWN THE

01:52:33.313 --> 01:52:33.913
LONG TERM LIABILITIES I'M TRYING

01:52:33.980 --> 01:52:34.547
TO FIGURE OUT HOW I FEEL ABOUT

01:52:34.614 --> 01:52:35.815
THE RATE RELIEF BECAUSE ON THE

01:52:35.882 --> 01:52:37.150
ONE HAND I KNOW THE PRESSURE

01:52:37.217 --> 01:52:38.985
THAT OUR SCHOOLS ARE UNDER.

01:52:39.052 --> 01:52:40.053
BUT I'M NOT SURE THAT HELPING

01:52:40.120 --> 01:52:42.188
THEM WITH RATES THIS YEAR AND

01:52:42.255 --> 01:52:43.389
NEXT YEAR.

01:52:43.456 --> 01:52:45.158
REALLY IS A IS NOT DOING THEM A

01:52:45.225 --> 01:52:46.326
DISSERVICE LONG TERM BECAUSE

01:52:46.392 --> 01:52:47.560
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GET

01:52:47.627 --> 01:52:49.562
THEIR ARMS AROUND.

01:52:49.629 --> 01:52:50.130
THE FACT THAT THE RATES ARE

01:52:50.196 --> 01:52:51.965
HIGHER -- I DON'T THINK THAT

01:52:52.031 --> 01:52:53.500
THAT FROM AN ACTUARIAL STAND FOR

01:52:53.566 --> 01:52:54.834
THAT THAT'S GOING TO CHANGE.

01:52:54.901 --> 01:52:56.636
ANYTIME SOON AND SO I WOULD

01:52:56.703 --> 01:52:57.670
ALMOST PREFER.

01:52:57.737 --> 01:52:59.672
THAT.

01:52:59.739 --> 01:53:00.773
THEY GIVE THAT REALIZATION

01:53:00.840 --> 01:53:02.075
SOONER MAKE IT WORK AND THEN WE

01:53:02.142 --> 01:53:04.110
CAN SAY TWO TO THREE DOLLARS FOR

01:53:04.177 --> 01:53:06.012
EVERY DOLLAR WE INVEST IF WE PUT

01:53:06.079 --> 01:53:06.846
ALL TOWARDS THE LONG TERM.

01:53:06.913 --> 01:53:08.314
BOB.

01:53:08.381 --> 01:53:09.749
PORTION BUT I'M TRYING TO FIGURE

01:53:09.816 --> 01:53:11.384
THAT OUT MY MAIL BUT IN GENERAL

01:53:11.451 --> 01:53:13.052
I'M I'M VERY SUPPORT OF WHAT

01:53:13.119 --> 01:53:14.754
YOU'RE TRYING TO DO -- SPEAKING

01:53:14.821 --> 01:53:16.189
OF A QUESTION FOR THE LA --

01:53:16.256 --> 01:53:20.460
TALKING ABOUT THE STEP THE ARE.

01:53:20.527 --> 01:53:20.994
THE THE RELIEF PAYMENTS.

01:53:21.060 --> 01:53:22.962
COULD WE PUT STRINGS ATTACHED TO

01:53:23.029 --> 01:53:24.097
THOSE SINCE IT'S A DOLLAR FOR

01:53:24.164 --> 01:53:25.365
DOLLAR REDUCTION IN SPENDING ON

01:53:25.431 --> 01:53:27.233
THE SCHOOLS IF WE WANTED TO SAY

01:53:27.300 --> 01:53:27.867
FOR EXAMPLE.

01:53:27.934 --> 01:53:29.035
WELCOME THIS IS GOING TO BE

01:53:29.102 --> 01:53:30.436
EXTRA MONEY BUT SHOULD WE DON'T

01:53:30.503 --> 01:53:32.138
WANT YOU TO SPEND ON SALARIES WE

01:53:32.205 --> 01:53:34.007
WANT TO SPEND IT ON I DON'T KNOW

01:53:34.073 --> 01:53:34.941
LONG TERM.

01:53:35.008 --> 01:53:38.011
INFRASTRUCTURE SOMETHING COULD

01:53:38.077 --> 01:53:39.012
WE DO THAT.

01:53:39.078 --> 01:53:40.113
I'LL HAVE TO DEFER TO MY

01:53:40.180 --> 01:53:40.747
COLLEAGUE WHO IS THE EXPERT ON

01:53:40.813 --> 01:53:47.987

01:53:52.325 --> 01:53:53.626
THE STATE IN THE PAST AND IT'S

01:53:53.693 --> 01:53:55.662
GIVEN DISTRICTS DISCRETIONARY

01:53:55.728 --> 01:53:57.664
MONEY HAS SOMETIMES -- ENCOURAGE

01:53:57.730 --> 01:53:58.965
DISTRICTS SUSPENDED IN SPECIFIC

01:53:59.032 --> 01:54:01.401
WAYS FOR EXAMPLE WE HAD ONE TIME

01:54:01.467 --> 01:54:02.769
DISCRETIONARY GRANTS.

01:54:02.835 --> 01:54:04.671
AND WE A FEW YEARS AGO AND WE

01:54:04.737 --> 01:54:07.340
ASK DISTRICTS TO ALLOCATE THEM --

01:54:07.407 --> 01:54:08.875
FOR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND

01:54:08.942 --> 01:54:10.543

DAYWITH EDUCATION BUT IT'S

01:54:27.827 --> 01:54:29.062
REALLY ABOUT.

01:54:29.128 --> 01:54:31.030
TRADE OFFS.

01:54:31.097 --> 01:54:32.065

WENT THROUGH WITH THAT SCHOOL

01:54:36.035 --> 01:54:37.036
DISTRICTS AND WITH THAT.

01:54:37.103 --> 01:54:39.639
THANK MATT COMING IN TALKING

01:54:39.706 --> 01:54:41.107
ABOUT DISTRICTS ON THE BUBBLE.

01:54:41.174 --> 01:54:42.809
IN THE IT'S A REAL RIGHT NOW SO

01:54:42.875 --> 01:54:44.510
I I KNOW I KNOW IT PROBABLY IS

01:54:44.577 --> 01:54:46.012
MORE PRUDENT TO BUY THEM OUT ON

01:54:46.079 --> 01:54:47.614
A LONG TERM BUT THERE ARE

01:54:47.680 --> 01:54:49.082
DISTRICTS LITERALLY THAT WE

01:54:49.148 --> 01:54:50.316
COULD BE COMING.

01:54:50.383 --> 01:54:51.651
RUNNING AT A CAST INCLUDING OUR

01:54:51.718 --> 01:54:52.719
DISTRICT RIGHT HERE IN

01:54:52.785 --> 01:54:54.454
SACRAMENTO IN LOS ANGELES AND UP

01:54:54.520 --> 01:54:55.788
AND DOWN THE STATE.

01:54:55.855 --> 01:54:59.492
AND THAT HAS A HUGE IMPACT ON US --

01:54:59.559 --> 01:55:01.594
AS WELL IT'S THE ONE THING TO

01:55:01.661 --> 01:55:04.497
CONSIDER IS THE IF YOU LOOK AT

01:55:04.564 --> 01:55:05.431
THAT.

01:55:05.498 --> 01:55:06.532
MY UNDERSTANDING IS IS WHEN WE

01:55:06.599 --> 01:55:09.569
DID THESE -- THESE REFORMS.

01:55:09.636 --> 01:55:10.970
THAT IT HAD KEPT THAT THE

01:55:11.037 --> 01:55:14.207
DISTRICTS INCREASED PERSON STIRS

01:55:14.274 --> 01:55:16.075
CONJURED INCREASE CONTRIBUTION

01:55:16.142 --> 01:55:19.746
PLATEAUS IN BY.

01:55:19.812 --> 01:55:20.346
TWENTY TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE

01:55:20.413 --> 01:55:21.748
SO THIS KIND OF GOES HAND IN

01:55:21.814 --> 01:55:23.416
HAND WITH THEIR SO SWIMMING WE

01:55:23.483 --> 01:55:24.617
DON'T HAVE.

01:55:24.684 --> 01:55:25.652
HUGE.

01:55:25.718 --> 01:55:27.754
FINANCIAL MELTDOWN.

01:55:27.820 --> 01:55:29.355
AND IF HE STILL GROW LC A PFAFF

01:55:29.422 --> 01:55:30.923
AT A REASONABLE CLIP NEXT FEW

01:55:30.990 --> 01:55:32.492
YEARS THERE WILL BE SOME

01:55:32.558 --> 01:55:34.160
BREATHING ROOM IN A COUPLE YEARS

01:55:34.227 --> 01:55:37.497
IS THAT CORRECT.

01:55:37.563 --> 01:55:38.931
THERE IT RIGHT RIGHT NOW THE

01:55:38.998 --> 01:55:40.867
RATE PROJECTIONS FOR CALLOUSED

01:55:40.933 --> 01:55:42.168
OR IS ARE THAT THE RATES --

01:55:42.235 --> 01:55:43.503
UNDER CURRENT LAW WOULD PEAK AT

01:55:43.569 --> 01:55:45.705
AROUND NINETEEN POINT 1% AND

01:55:45.772 --> 01:55:46.406
THEN YOU'RE RIGHT THEY WERE

01:55:46.472 --> 01:55:48.207
SCHEDULED TO DROP ABOUT A

01:55:48.274 --> 01:55:49.409
PERCENTAGE POINT THE YEAR AFTER

01:55:49.475 --> 01:55:50.576
THAT.

01:55:50.643 --> 01:55:51.210
SO THERE'S A CERTAIN MOVING OUT

01:55:51.277 --> 01:55:52.145
PERIOD.

01:55:52.211 --> 01:55:53.746
RIGHT THAT IS FOR CAN AT THAT IS

01:55:53.813 --> 01:55:54.914
FAIRLY SENSITIVE TO HOW THE

01:55:54.981 --> 01:55:56.849
ECONOMY IS DOING IF WE WERE TO

01:55:56.916 --> 01:55:58.451
HAVE A RECESSION OR COASTERS

01:55:58.518 --> 01:55:59.852
WERE TO EXPERIENCE SOME

01:55:59.919 --> 01:56:01.654
SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT LOSSES

01:56:01.721 --> 01:56:02.855
IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THE RATE.

01:56:02.922 --> 01:56:04.057
AND STATE OF DROPPING COULD

01:56:04.123 --> 01:56:05.391
ACTUALLY GO UP FROM NINETEEN

01:56:05.458 --> 01:56:06.993
POINT 1% OF SORT OF PRETTY

01:56:07.060 --> 01:56:08.294
SENSITIVE.

01:56:08.361 --> 01:56:10.363
TO OUT HOW THE FUND PERFORMS AND

01:56:10.430 --> 01:56:11.964
HOW THE ECONOMY DOES THE NEXT

01:56:12.031 --> 01:56:13.566
COUPLE YEARS.

01:56:13.633 --> 01:56:14.901
SURE SO ALL THINGS BEING EQUAL

01:56:14.967 --> 01:56:16.569
WITH THIS MOVING IN THE NEXT

01:56:16.636 --> 01:56:20.573
COUPLE YEARS AND IF YOU DID THIS --

01:56:20.640 --> 01:56:21.974
ACTION HERE.

01:56:22.041 --> 01:56:23.343
THAT WOULD HELP THE DISTRICTS

01:56:23.409 --> 01:56:25.845
THE NEXT FEW YEARS THAT WOULD.

01:56:25.912 --> 01:56:27.680
PRODUCE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF

01:56:27.747 --> 01:56:29.115
FINANCE RELIEF.

01:56:29.182 --> 01:56:30.850
TODAY BUT ACTUALLY GET TO A

01:56:30.917 --> 01:56:32.618
BRIDGE TO WHERE THEY'LL HAVE

[inaudible]

01:56:32.985 --> 01:56:35.254
MORE SUSTAINABILITY.

A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT RELIEF ME

01:56:39.759 --> 01:56:41.761
ONE POINT. TWO BILLION IN IN ONE

01:56:41.828 --> 01:56:43.596
HOUSE ONE POINT EIGHT TO ANOTHER

01:56:43.663 --> 01:56:46.299
I MEAN THAT IN A IN THE SHORT

01:56:46.366 --> 01:56:46.766
TERM IT'S IT'S PRETTY

01:56:46.833 --> 01:56:48.267

01:57:35.715 --> 01:57:37.150
HEATED DISCUSSIONS WITH

01:57:37.216 --> 01:57:39.085
SACRAMENTO CITY SCHOOL DISTRICT

01:57:39.152 --> 01:57:41.087
SO THERE'S SOME SIGNS AND

01:57:41.154 --> 01:57:42.722
SIGNALS THAT WERE THAT THINGS

01:57:42.789 --> 01:57:43.589
COULD BE.

01:57:43.656 --> 01:57:46.659
COMING SO WITH THAT.

01:57:46.726 --> 01:57:47.226
I THINK THEY BOTH SHOULD BE

01:57:47.293 --> 01:57:48.461
FUNDED HIGHER.

01:57:48.528 --> 01:57:50.229

BEING DONE HERE AND BUT I I

01:58:09.849 --> 01:58:11.484
STILL HAVE.

01:58:11.551 --> 01:58:13.019
UGH SOME CONCERNS AS TO WHETHER

01:58:13.085 --> 01:58:15.555

01:58:15.621 --> 01:58:16.889
OF SOME.

01:58:16.956 --> 01:58:18.157
LEVEL OF INDEPENDENCE WITH

01:58:18.224 --> 01:58:21.260
REGARDS TO THIS PARTICULAR FUND --

01:58:21.327 --> 01:58:23.062
EVER SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE WE'VE

01:58:23.129 --> 01:58:24.397
ALWAYS HAD A PENSION PROBLEM.

01:58:24.464 --> 01:58:26.532
IN OUR SCHOOLS AND SO I'M

01:58:26.599 --> 01:58:29.335
WONDERING IF ANY OF YOU AS AN

01:58:29.402 --> 01:58:31.037

01:58:41.948 --> 01:58:47.253
ISSUES THAT WE FACE IN THIS AREA.

01:58:47.320 --> 01:58:48.187
BECAUSE I GET THE SENSE THAT

01:58:48.254 --> 01:58:49.622
EVEN IF WE GIVE A CONTRIBUTION

01:58:49.689 --> 01:58:51.457
NOW.

01:58:51.524 --> 01:58:53.559

01:58:54.961 --> 01:58:56.963
PAYING DOWN THE DEBT.

01:58:57.029 --> 01:58:57.563
THAT WILL ONE WILL STILL BE IN

01:58:57.630 --> 01:58:59.065
DEBT.

01:58:59.131 --> 01:59:00.867
AND IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS WILL

01:59:00.933 --> 01:59:02.268
BE.

01:59:02.335 --> 01:59:03.736
TALKING ABOUT THIS AGAIN.

01:59:03.803 --> 01:59:06.105
OKAY SO HAVE ANY VIEW ACTUALLY

01:59:06.172 --> 01:59:08.074

THIS PROBLEM [inaudible] FOR

01:59:12.078 --> 01:59:13.946
EVER.

01:59:14.013 --> 01:59:15.314
I'M JUST CURIOUS BECAUSE I MEAN

01:59:15.381 --> 01:59:16.849
I HAVE HAD THIS CONVERSATION

01:59:16.916 --> 01:59:17.617
EVER SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE LONG

01:59:17.683 --> 01:59:18.985
THAT BEEN ON THE BUDGET THERE'S

01:59:19.051 --> 01:59:19.785

01:59:21.153 --> 01:59:21.988
WITH THE PENSION PLANS

01:59:22.054 --> 01:59:22.288
[inaudible]

01:59:22.355 --> 01:59:24.056
DATA.

01:59:24.123 --> 01:59:25.424
SO I'M AND I ALWAYS LIKE WE DO

01:59:25.491 --> 01:59:27.193
IN SOME GOOD WE JUST REALLY

01:59:27.260 --> 01:59:29.195
WAITING FOR THE PROBLEM.

01:59:29.262 --> 01:59:30.129
TO THAT IT WON'T SOLVE ITSELF

01:59:30.196 --> 01:59:31.230
BUT WE JUST SEEM TO PRETEND THAT

01:59:31.297 --> 01:59:33.733
WE ARE AND AND AS A RESULT WE

01:59:33.799 --> 01:59:34.934
HAVEN'T REALLY.

01:59:35.001 --> 01:59:36.502

IS NOW WE NEED TO MOVE AT THIS

01:59:42.975 --> 01:59:44.410
DIRECTION WITH THIS KIND OF

01:59:44.477 --> 01:59:45.745
ACCOUNTABILITY OF THIS KIND OF

01:59:45.811 --> 01:59:46.612
RESOURCES.

01:59:46.679 --> 01:59:47.747
BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE

01:59:47.813 --> 01:59:49.715
THIS EVERY DAY I WOULD HATE TO

01:59:49.782 --> 01:59:51.250
HAVE THIS KIND OF FINANCIAL

01:59:51.317 --> 01:59:52.518
PROBLEM MY HOUSEHOLD.

01:59:52.585 --> 01:59:54.654
AND NOT THINK AT SOME POINT THAT

01:59:54.720 --> 01:59:56.856
I'M GOING TO GET OUT OF THIS DID.

01:59:56.923 --> 01:59:57.657
OR VOICE TO BASICALLY

01:59:57.723 --> 01:59:59.559
RESTRUCTURE WHAT I'M DOING OR

01:59:59.625 --> 02:00:01.227
WHATEVER I MEAN I YOU KNOW THIS

02:00:01.294 --> 02:00:02.828
IS A SEEMS TO BE AN ONGOING

02:00:02.895 --> 02:00:04.430
CONVERSATION.

02:00:04.497 --> 02:00:05.898
AND OF THOSE OF US WHO REGULARLY

02:00:05.965 --> 02:00:07.900
SIX SEVEN YEARS OR MORE HAVE HAD

02:00:07.967 --> 02:00:09.068
THIS CONVERSATION OVER AND OVER.

02:00:09.135 --> 02:00:13.306
ARE ANY OF YOU WORKING ON

02:00:13.372 --> 02:00:15.541
SOMETHING.

02:00:15.608 --> 02:00:16.976
YEAH YOU MAY BE AND YOU MAY NOT

02:00:17.043 --> 02:00:18.010
WANT TELLS WHAT IT IS BUT I JUST

02:00:18.077 --> 02:00:18.878
I JUST WHAT IT IS IF ANYONE IS

02:00:18.945 --> 02:00:19.378
WORKING ON SOMETHING.

02:00:19.445 --> 02:00:21.314
THAT BEGINS TO REALLY ADDRESS

02:00:21.380 --> 02:00:24.450
THIS VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM.

02:00:24.517 --> 02:00:25.751
I'LL SPEAK TO IT WITH A TWO

02:00:25.818 --> 02:00:27.219
POINT SEVEN FIRST.

02:00:27.286 --> 02:00:28.854
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT AND WE

02:00:28.921 --> 02:00:30.323
DIDN'T GET INTO THE SITUATION

02:00:30.389 --> 02:00:31.657
WITH THESE LARGE UNFUNDED

02:00:31.724 --> 02:00:33.259
LIABILITIES OVERNIGHT AND SO

02:00:33.326 --> 02:00:34.260
THERE'S NO WAY.

02:00:34.327 --> 02:00:35.628
TO GET OUT OF THEM QUICKLY BUT

02:00:35.695 --> 02:00:37.363
FIRST I THINK THE STATE HAS MADE

02:00:37.430 --> 02:00:38.664
SOME PROGRESS IN THE LAST

02:00:38.731 --> 02:00:39.865
SEVERAL YEARS WE MENTION

02:00:39.932 --> 02:00:41.634
MCALISTER'S FUNDING PLAN WHICH

02:00:41.701 --> 02:00:43.502
PASSED FIVE YEARS AGO -- BOTH

02:00:43.569 --> 02:00:45.171
THE CAL STIRS AND CALPERS BOARDS

02:00:45.237 --> 02:00:46.772
HAVE REDUCED THE INVESTMENT

02:00:46.839 --> 02:00:49.008
RETURN RATE ASSUMPTION -- WHICH

02:00:49.075 --> 02:00:50.810
MAKES SURE THAT -- BOTH YOU KNOW

02:00:50.876 --> 02:00:51.911
EVERYONE IS PAYING MORE INTO THE

02:00:51.978 --> 02:00:53.212
SYSTEM SO THAT WE'RE NOT ON THE

02:00:53.279 --> 02:00:54.814
HOOK LATER WHEN IT COMES TO

02:00:54.880 --> 02:00:56.015
RETIREE HEALTH.

02:00:56.082 --> 02:00:58.084
BENEFITS WE'RE NOW BEGINNING TO

02:00:58.150 --> 02:00:59.185
PRE FUND THOSE AS A STATE AND

02:00:59.251 --> 02:01:01.187
SLOWLY PAYING OFF THAT UNFUNDED

02:01:01.253 --> 02:01:02.922
LIABILITY WITH THE GOAL AS WITH

02:01:02.989 --> 02:01:04.256
CAL STAR IS A FULLY PAYING OFF

02:01:04.323 --> 02:01:09.161
THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY.

02:01:09.228 --> 02:01:09.695
TWENTY FORTY SIX BUT YOUR

02:01:09.762 --> 02:01:10.262
BROADER POINT.

02:01:10.329 --> 02:01:14.400
THAT IS THE GOAL YES.

02:01:14.467 --> 02:01:16.135
BUT TO THE TO THE BROADER POINT

02:01:16.202 --> 02:01:17.870
IT IS IT THIS IS A DISCUSSION

02:01:17.937 --> 02:01:19.505
THAT WE ALL KNOW WHAT WE NEED TO

02:01:19.572 --> 02:01:20.806
CONTINUE.

02:01:20.873 --> 02:01:22.408
BUT THE PRINCIPLE THAT THE

02:01:22.475 --> 02:01:24.377
ISSUES ARE VERY COMPLICATED BUT

02:01:24.443 --> 02:01:25.611
IN SOME WAYS THEY'RE ALSO VERY

02:01:25.678 --> 02:01:28.648
pIN NOW TO PAY OFF THE UNFUNDED

02:01:28.714 --> 02:01:29.682
LIABILITY.

02:01:29.749 --> 02:01:30.783
THE LAST THAT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE

02:01:30.850 --> 02:01:32.184
TO PUT IN A WAITER AND OVER TIME

02:01:32.251 --> 02:01:33.686
AND THAT WILL RELIEVE PRESSURE

02:01:33.753 --> 02:01:35.988
ON THE GENERAL FUND OVER THE

02:01:36.055 --> 02:01:36.555
LONG TERM AND THAT'S WHY THE

02:01:36.622 --> 02:01:38.324
GOVERNOR. THREE DAYS AFTER HE

02:01:38.391 --> 02:01:39.558
CAME INTO OFFICE AND WHEN HE PUT

02:01:39.625 --> 02:01:41.227
OUT THIS BUDGET REALLY WANTED TO

02:01:41.293 --> 02:01:42.461
PUT FORWARD THAT THREE BILLION

02:01:42.528 --> 02:01:44.030
DOLLARS FOR CAL STARS FOR

02:01:44.096 --> 02:01:45.798
SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT. TWO POINT

02:01:45.865 --> 02:01:47.066
NINE BILLION I'M SORRY THREE

02:01:47.133 --> 02:01:48.834
GOING TO CALPERS TWO POINT NINE

02:01:48.901 --> 02:01:50.636
GOING TO CAL SIRS AFTER

02:01:50.703 --> 02:01:52.304
PROPOSITION TWO PAYMENTS BECAUSE

02:01:52.371 --> 02:01:53.372
NO MATTER WHAT PLAN YOU

02:01:53.439 --> 02:01:54.907
ULTIMATELY A DOCTOR HOW YOU

02:01:54.974 --> 02:01:56.242
RESOLVE THIS OVER TIME.

02:01:56.308 --> 02:01:57.710
STARTING NOW AND PUTTING MONEY

02:01:57.777 --> 02:01:59.412
AND NOW WILL ALWAYS MAKE A

02:01:59.478 --> 02:02:00.012
POSITIVE DIFFERENCE OVER THE

02:02:00.079 --> 02:02:04.750
LONG TERM ASSUMING THE MARKET

02:02:04.817 --> 02:02:06.519
OVER TIME CONTINUES TO GROW

02:02:06.585 --> 02:02:06.819
[inaudible]

02:02:06.886 --> 02:02:08.387
OKAY.

02:02:08.454 --> 02:02:10.923
I SOME YOU'LL BE HEARING TWENTY

02:02:10.990 --> 02:02:12.925
FORTY SIX SO OKAY.

02:02:12.992 --> 02:02:13.993
I HAVE TO BELIEVE I'M NOT THE

02:02:14.060 --> 02:02:16.629
ONLY PERSON I JUST DID THAT

02:02:16.696 --> 02:02:17.229
MENTAL MATH TO FIGURE OUT HOW

02:02:17.296 --> 02:02:19.065
OLD IT.

02:02:19.131 --> 02:02:22.968
FEELS LIKE A WELL MADE MY

02:02:23.035 --> 02:02:23.235
GRANDSON.

02:02:23.302 --> 02:02:26.038
OF I'M JUST YOU KNOW I I THINK

02:02:26.105 --> 02:02:27.640
AND AND THAT'S GOOD TO KNOW THAT

02:02:27.707 --> 02:02:29.475
BUT I YOU KNOW -- SO ANYWAY JUST

02:02:29.542 --> 02:02:30.109
BECAUSE WE SEE THIS EVERY YEAR

02:02:30.176 --> 02:02:32.144
AND I'M WONDERING IF THIS IS A

02:02:32.211 --> 02:02:33.279
WHOLE THAT EVEN GROHL'S IT NEVER

02:02:33.345 --> 02:02:34.780
GETS FIELD OR WHATEVER THE DEAL

02:02:34.847 --> 02:02:36.082
MAY BE THAT NEW THINGS COME

02:02:36.148 --> 02:02:38.551
ALONG AND HEATED UP AGAIN AND SO

02:02:38.617 --> 02:02:39.985
WE'RE FOR EVER SEEM LIKE DIGGING

02:02:40.052 --> 02:02:41.620
DEEPER AND DEEPER AND I KNOW.

02:02:41.687 --> 02:02:43.823
WE WERE WORKING TO MAKE PROGRESS

02:02:43.889 --> 02:02:45.024
SO IT'S NOT ON ONE OTHER MAY NOT

02:02:45.091 --> 02:02:45.658
MAKE VERY BRIEFLY IS THAT SOME

02:02:45.725 --> 02:02:48.227
OF THESE CHANGES AND ASSUMPTIONS.

02:02:48.294 --> 02:02:49.495
THE WHOLE THAT WERE AND IS A

02:02:49.562 --> 02:02:51.097
FUNCTION OF WHAT ASSUMPTIONS YOU

02:02:51.163 --> 02:02:52.598
MAKE ABOUT WHAT PAYMENTS YOU'RE

02:02:52.665 --> 02:02:53.399
GONNA MAKE IN THE FUTURE.

02:02:53.466 --> 02:02:56.001
SO WHEN CAL STIRS OUR CALPERS --

02:02:56.068 --> 02:02:57.870
REVISES THEIR DISCOUNT OR

02:02:57.937 --> 02:02:59.271
INVESTMENT RETURN RATE OR THEY

02:02:59.338 --> 02:03:00.706
REALIZED THAT PEOPLE ARE MAY BE

02:03:00.773 --> 02:03:02.174
LIVING LONGER THAN WE THOUGHT.

02:03:02.241 --> 02:03:03.876
THE WHOLE GETS BIGGER BUT IT'S

02:03:03.943 --> 02:03:05.478
NOT THAT WE'VE LOST MONEY IT'S

02:03:05.544 --> 02:03:07.146
JUST A MORE ACCURATE REFLECTION

02:03:07.213 --> 02:03:09.448
OF THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY SO

02:03:09.515 --> 02:03:10.316
YOU'RE PUTTING WHATEVER THE SIZE

02:03:10.382 --> 02:03:11.484
OF THAT WHOLE IS IN REALITY

02:03:11.550 --> 02:03:18.057
PUTTING MONEY IN RIGHT NOW WILL

02:03:18.124 --> 02:03:18.390
MAKE IT SMALL.

02:03:18.457 --> 02:03:20.693
OKAY.

02:03:20.760 --> 02:03:21.961
HELLO YOU HAVING ANY WISDOM ON

02:03:22.027 --> 02:03:22.728
THIS MATTER.

02:03:22.795 --> 02:03:23.496
I THINK WE MIGHT JUST EMPHASIZE

02:03:23.562 --> 02:03:24.163
THAT THE CHARACTERS FUNDING PLAN

02:03:24.230 --> 02:03:25.030
WAS A REALLY SIGNIFICANT

02:03:25.097 --> 02:03:26.365
MILESTONE FOR THE STATE THE

02:03:26.432 --> 02:03:28.234
SYSTEM HASN'T.

02:03:28.300 --> 02:03:29.268
BEEN APPROPRIATELY FUNDED FOR

02:03:29.335 --> 02:03:30.636
MOST OF ITS A HUNDRED PLUS YEAR

02:03:30.703 --> 02:03:31.804
HISTORY.

02:03:31.871 --> 02:03:34.206
AND TWENTY FOURTEEN THE STATE

02:03:34.273 --> 02:03:36.108
WITH THAT PLAN WENT FROM --

02:03:36.175 --> 02:03:37.576
TRAJECTORY WHERE THE SYSTEM IS.

02:03:37.643 --> 02:03:38.744

ABOUT THEIR RECOVERY EFFORTS AND

02:11:10.596 --> 02:11:12.130

ALMOST EVERY WEEK.

02:12:20.866 --> 02:12:21.733

02:12:21.800 --> 02:12:23.602
IT'S AN APT DESCRIPTION THE

02:12:23.669 --> 02:12:25.370

BEING SUCH A VELOCITY.

02:12:42.554 --> 02:12:44.456

CITIES IN THAT COUNTY.

02:12:46.625 --> 02:12:48.026
AND THAT'S PART OF WHY THIS

02:12:48.093 --> 02:12:51.029
ASSEMBLY ACTION IS HELPFUL.

02:12:51.096 --> 02:12:52.197

02:13:20.292 --> 02:13:24.363
DECADES. TO COME BACK.

02:13:24.429 --> 02:13:25.931

FIRE WHICH IS.

02:13:40.045 --> 02:13:41.646
WHAT'S HAPPENED UP THERE IS THE

02:13:41.713 --> 02:13:43.181
WATER DISTRICTS.

02:13:43.248 --> 02:13:44.549
HAVE NO WATER CELL.

02:13:44.616 --> 02:13:46.151
THEY HAVE NO CUSTOMERS.

02:13:46.218 --> 02:13:46.885
SO WE'RE HAVING TO AND WE'RE

02:13:46.952 --> 02:13:49.087

02:13:51.590 --> 02:13:52.924
THE IMPACT ON OTHER COMMUNITIES

02:13:52.991 --> 02:13:55.460
ARE ALSO SIGNIFICANT.

02:13:55.527 --> 02:13:57.496
IT JUST BECAUSE IT'S PARADISE IT

02:13:57.562 --> 02:13:58.330

AIR AREAS THAT ARE AFFECTED.

02:14:01.199 --> 02:14:02.801

LEGISLATURE HAS BEEN VERY KIND

02:14:04.870 --> 02:14:06.238

AS WE THINK IT'S CERTAINLY

02:23:01.072 --> 02:23:02.774
APPROPRIATE FOR THE LEGISLATURE

02:23:02.840 --> 02:23:05.176
TO REQUIRE REPORTING THE

AND WITH PUBLIC SAFETY IN MIND

02:29:08.839 --> 02:29:12.310
WHAT WE ARE VERY FOCUSED ON IS

02:29:12.376 --> 02:29:14.945
TRYING TO ENSURE THAT WHEN FOLKS

02:29:15.012 --> 02:29:16.380

TALKED ABOUT THAT.

02:29:57.822 --> 02:29:58.689
WHEN WE DON'T WHEN WE TALKED IN

02:29:58.756 --> 02:30:00.257
EDUCATION SO I WON'T GO THROUGH

02:30:00.324 --> 02:30:02.760
THAT AGAIN -- BUT ONE OF THE

02:30:02.827 --> 02:30:06.097

PROGRAM WHICHIS BEEN

02:30:07.598 --> 02:30:10.334
ADMINISTERED BY THE SEC.

02:30:10.401 --> 02:30:14.939
AND IT WAS FIRST STARTED BACK IN

02:30:15.005 --> 02:30:16.340
TWENTY FOURTEEN BUT DUE TO LACK

02:30:16.407 --> 02:30:19.844
OF CLARIFICATION THE TBL. ONE

02:30:19.910 --> 02:30:21.212
VERY LITTLE OF THE MONEY THAT

02:30:21.278 --> 02:30:23.314
THE FCC MADE AVAILABLE WAS

02:30:23.381 --> 02:30:24.582
ACTUALLY DELIVERED TO THE

02:30:24.648 --> 02:30:25.850

THAT THE OR IF P. THAT WAS PUT

02:30:33.324 --> 02:30:35.059
OUT WAS DESIGNED SO THAT THE

02:30:35.126 --> 02:30:36.694
COMMUNITY BASED GROUPS WOULD BE

02:30:36.761 --> 02:30:38.295
ABLE.

02:30:38.362 --> 02:30:40.464
TO COMPLY WITH THE RULES AND

02:30:40.531 --> 02:30:42.466

02:30:50.541 --> 02:30:54.612
AND I BELIEVE -- DSCC HAD ABOUT --

02:30:54.678 --> 02:30:56.080

MONEY THAT WAS AVAILABLE.

02:31:09.827 --> 02:31:11.829
AND SO SOMETIMES WHEN WE CREATE

02:31:11.896 --> 02:31:13.931

CERTAIN KEY METRICS ON A REGULAR

02:33:17.655 --> 02:33:18.689
BASIS.

02:33:18.756 --> 02:33:19.423
THE SENATE APPROVED THIS

02:33:19.490 --> 02:33:20.057
PROPOSAL AND ADOPTED PLACEHOLDER

02:33:20.124 --> 02:33:22.059
TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE.

02:33:22.126 --> 02:33:23.294
ASSEMBLY APPROVED THE FUNDING

02:33:23.360 --> 02:33:25.229

LANGUAGE.

02:33:26.830 --> 02:33:27.965
THE ASSEMBLY PACKAGES DIFFERENT

02:33:28.032 --> 02:33:29.400
IN TWO KEY WAYS.

02:33:29.466 --> 02:33:32.102
THE FIRST IS IN RELATIONSHIP TO

02:33:32.169 --> 02:33:34.038
THE SPECIFIED GOALS OF THE PILOT

02:33:34.104 --> 02:33:36.140
THE ASSEMBLY'S PLAN IS TO LIMIT

02:33:36.206 --> 02:33:37.942
THE PILOT TO THE USE AND

02:33:38.008 --> 02:33:39.343
VALIDATION OF THOSE TOOLS.

02:33:39.410 --> 02:33:41.045
THAT MAKE THEIR METHODOLOGY

02:33:41.111 --> 02:33:42.112
PUBLICLY AVAILABLE ONCE AGAIN

02:33:42.179 --> 02:33:43.447
THAT'S LIMIT RATHER THAN EXPAND

02:33:43.514 --> 02:33:44.515
THE IS.

02:33:44.582 --> 02:33:45.916
THE SECOND DIFFERENCES IN TERMS

02:33:45.983 --> 02:33:47.318
OF ACCEPTABLE USES OF THE

02:33:47.384 --> 02:33:49.086
FUNDING THE ASSEMBLY'S PLAN

02:33:49.153 --> 02:33:52.323
ALLOWS -- FOR THE SUPPORT OF THE

02:33:52.389 --> 02:33:53.324
EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION BE.

02:33:53.390 --> 02:33:54.892
BETWEEN COURTS AND PRE TRIAL

02:33:54.959 --> 02:33:56.794
SERVICES AGENCIES RATHER THAN

02:33:56.860 --> 02:33:58.596
JUST COUNTY PROBATION AND SO

02:33:58.662 --> 02:34:00.164
THAT WOULD ALLOW OTHER COUNTY

02:34:00.230 --> 02:34:02.366
AGENCIES TO BE -- FUNDED USING

02:34:02.433 --> 02:34:03.834
THOSE DOLLARS.

02:34:03.901 --> 02:34:05.069
AND SO THIS REALLY IS AN ISSUE

02:34:05.135 --> 02:34:06.804
OF LEGISLATIVE PRIORITY FOR HOW

02:34:06.870 --> 02:34:08.572
THE LEGISLATURE WANTS THIS PILOT

02:34:08.639 --> 02:34:10.040
TO BE IMPLEMENTED.

02:34:10.107 --> 02:34:11.408
AS WELL AS WHO SHOULD BE ALLOWED

02:34:11.475 --> 02:34:13.043
TO PARTICIPATE.

02:34:13.110 --> 02:34:13.811
WE WOULD NOT THAT THERE IS

02:34:13.877 --> 02:34:15.212
ACTUALLY A TECHNICAL DIFFERENCES

02:34:15.279 --> 02:34:16.714
WHILE THE SENATE AND THE

02:34:16.780 --> 02:34:18.315
ADMINISTRATION'S PLAN IS MAINLY

02:34:18.382 --> 02:34:19.783
AND BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE VERSES

02:34:19.850 --> 02:34:21.218
THE ASSEMBLY WHICH IS MAINLY AND

02:34:21.285 --> 02:34:22.219
TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE.

02:34:22.286 --> 02:34:23.387
THIS IS A TWO YEAR PILOT SO IT

02:34:23.454 --> 02:34:25.022
COULD BENEFIT FROM HAVING THE

02:34:25.089 --> 02:34:27.491
LANGUAGE IN THE STATUTE.

02:34:27.558 --> 02:34:29.627
THANK YOU SO MUCH FINANCE WE

02:34:29.693 --> 02:34:30.661

OF THE METHODOLOGY BY WHICH

02:35:32.923 --> 02:35:34.892
JUDGESHIPS WOULD BE ALLOCATED --

02:35:34.958 --> 02:35:36.460
WE WOULD JUST NOTE THAT.

02:35:36.527 --> 02:35:37.695
THE JUDGESHIPS HAVE

02:35:37.761 --> 02:35:39.396
TRADITIONALLY OR HISTORICALLY

02:35:39.463 --> 02:35:40.464

HOLD TO ITS MAY REVISION

02:35:54.244 --> 02:35:55.479
PROPOSAL AND DOES BELIEVE

02:35:55.546 --> 02:35:57.114
STRONGLY THAT THE JUDICIAL

FOR DOING THIS THANK YOU VERY

02:36:06.757 --> 02:36:08.892
MUCH MUCH NEEDED ACROSS THE

02:36:08.959 --> 02:36:09.827
STATE NOT JUST AN INLAND

02:36:09.893 --> 02:36:11.128
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA BUT THE

02:36:11.195 --> 02:36:12.429
CENTRAL VALLEY IN.

02:36:12.496 --> 02:36:13.897
MANY OTHER PLACES.

02:36:13.964 --> 02:36:15.032
AS WE MOVE FORWARD IN AS WE

02:36:15.099 --> 02:36:16.900
CRAFT THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE

02:36:16.967 --> 02:36:17.968
WHEN I WOULD ASK.

02:36:18.035 --> 02:36:19.837
IS THAT WE ENSURE THAT THE STAFF

02:36:19.903 --> 02:36:21.438
COMPONENT.

02:36:21.505 --> 02:36:24.708
STAYS WITH THE JUDGE POSITION.

02:36:24.775 --> 02:36:26.944
AND THAT THERE IS NO OPPORTUNITY

02:36:27.010 --> 02:36:28.112
TO SPLIT.

02:36:28.178 --> 02:36:30.347
THE STAFF FUNDING OFF FROM THE

02:36:30.414 --> 02:36:31.548
JUDICIAL POSITION.

02:36:31.615 --> 02:36:32.883
BECAUSE OF COURSE THAT WOULD

02:36:32.950 --> 02:36:34.485
DEFEAT THE PURPOSE FOR CREATING

02:36:34.551 --> 02:36:36.520
NEW JUDGESHIPS IF WE CAN'T OPEN

02:36:36.587 --> 02:36:37.821
NEW COURT ROOMS.

02:36:37.888 --> 02:36:39.890
AND I HAVE HEARD ANECDOTALLY

02:36:39.957 --> 02:36:41.525
THAT THERE IS

02:36:41.592 --> 02:36:44.328
SOME -- CONVERSATION NOT IN THIS

02:36:44.394 --> 02:36:46.463
BUILDING NOT ON THE FIRST FLOOR

02:36:46.530 --> 02:36:48.699
BUT OUTSIDE. TO DO JUST THAT AND

02:36:48.766 --> 02:36:49.600
THAT WOULD BE COMPLETELY

02:36:49.666 --> 02:36:51.368
UNACCEPTABLE TO ME AND I'M SURE

02:36:51.435 --> 02:36:53.003
IT WOULD BE TO MY COLLEAGUES TO

02:36:53.070 --> 02:36:54.204

02:37:04.648 --> 02:37:05.682
NEWSOME.

02:37:05.749 --> 02:37:06.650
FOR PAYING SOME ATTENTION TO

02:37:06.717 --> 02:37:07.818
THIS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT ISSUE

02:37:07.885 --> 02:37:09.052
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE

02:37:09.119 --> 02:37:11.155
BEEN ASKING -- FOR BAKING FOR

02:37:11.221 --> 02:37:13.190
WOULDN'T BE OVERSTATING IT FOUR

02:37:13.257 --> 02:37:14.391
OF THE FIVE YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN

02:37:14.458 --> 02:37:15.626
IN THE LEGISLATURE SOMETHING I'M

02:37:15.692 --> 02:37:17.594
VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT.

02:37:17.661 --> 02:37:19.763
GOVERNOR BROWN.

02:37:19.830 --> 02:37:21.598
ALWAYS THE THE FISCAL

02:37:21.665 --> 02:37:23.200
CONSERVATIVE -- WAS OF THE

02:37:23.267 --> 02:37:25.169
OPINION THAT WE WERE OVER

02:37:25.235 --> 02:37:26.770
RESOURCE IN JUDGES IN SOME

02:37:26.837 --> 02:37:28.172
COUNTIES IN UNDER RESOURCE AND

02:37:28.238 --> 02:37:30.107
OTHERS AND HE ALWAYS WOULD TELL

02:37:30.174 --> 02:37:31.742
US THAT WE NEEDED TO TAKE JUDGES

02:37:31.809 --> 02:37:32.810
AWAY FROM.

02:37:32.876 --> 02:37:33.610
THE COURTS THEY WERE OVER

02:37:33.677 --> 02:37:35.245
RESOURCE BUT IF YOU ASK THE

02:37:35.312 --> 02:37:36.747
COURTS NONE OF THEM THINK THAT

02:37:36.814 --> 02:37:38.348
THEIR OVER RESOURCE AND SO THAT

02:37:38.415 --> 02:37:39.249
WAS JUST A POLITICAL

02:37:39.316 --> 02:37:40.717
IMPOSSIBILITY AND SO THAT WE

02:37:40.784 --> 02:37:42.686
WHICH IS PERPETUATED THIS

02:37:42.753 --> 02:37:44.388
PROBLEM OF JUDGE SHORTAGES.

02:37:44.454 --> 02:37:45.489
I WILL SAY THOUGH THAT THIS IS

02:37:45.556 --> 02:37:47.491
IT'S A GOOD START -- BUT

02:37:47.558 --> 02:37:48.859
ACCORDING TO JUDICIAL COUNCIL WE

02:37:48.926 --> 02:37:50.394
NEED ABOUT A HUNDRED NINETY

02:37:50.460 --> 02:37:52.429
JUDGES RIGHT NOW STATEWIDE TO

02:37:52.496 --> 02:37:53.330
HANDLE THE WORKLOAD SO TWENTY

02:37:53.397 --> 02:37:53.831
FIVE IS.

02:37:53.897 --> 02:37:55.098
THE IS GREAT I'M HOPING THAT WE

02:37:55.165 --> 02:37:56.567
CAN CONTINUE TO WHITTLE DOWN ON

02:37:56.633 --> 02:37:57.601
THAT IN THE FUTURE.

02:37:57.668 --> 02:37:59.703
AND I ALSO HAVE TO MAKE THE

02:37:59.770 --> 02:38:00.737
POINT THAT.

02:38:00.804 --> 02:38:03.640
IT IS EXTREMELY UNBALANCED.

02:38:03.707 --> 02:38:06.076
THE THE JUDICIAL -- THAT THE

02:38:06.143 --> 02:38:07.411
NEED FOR THESE JUDGES ACROSS

02:38:07.477 --> 02:38:08.879
CALIFORNIA WE'VEHAD

02:38:08.946 --> 02:38:10.280
HISTORICALLY A LOT OF GROWTH IN

02:38:10.347 --> 02:38:11.548
SOME AREAS OF THE STATE NOT SO

02:38:11.615 --> 02:38:12.683
MUCH IN OTHERS.

02:38:12.749 --> 02:38:15.452
AND THAT'S LEFT US WITH.

02:38:15.519 --> 02:38:16.019
SOME COURTS THAT ARE JUST

02:38:16.086 --> 02:38:16.854
COMPLETELY.

02:38:16.920 --> 02:38:18.355
OVER WORKED AND UNDER RESOURCE

02:38:18.422 --> 02:38:20.924
LIKE THE ONES IN RIVERSIDE AND

02:38:20.991 --> 02:38:21.959
SAN MARINO AND KERN.

02:38:22.025 --> 02:38:24.695
ARE THE ARE THE THREE BIGGEST SO.

02:38:24.761 --> 02:38:25.963
A I'M INTERESTED IN IS A

02:38:26.029 --> 02:38:26.964
QUESTION FOR THE LA -- I'M

02:38:27.030 --> 02:38:28.398
INTERESTED IN THE SENATE TRAILER

02:38:28.465 --> 02:38:30.167
BILL LANGUAGE BECAUSE I HAVE NOT

02:38:30.234 --> 02:38:31.134
SEEN THAT LANGUAGE AND WONDERING

02:38:31.201 --> 02:38:32.736
IF YOU HAVE SEEN THAT LANGUAGE

02:38:32.803 --> 02:38:33.337
IF YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THE

02:38:33.403 --> 02:38:34.238
INTENT.

02:38:34.304 --> 02:38:37.241
OF THE LANGUAGES.

02:38:37.307 --> 02:38:38.375
WE HAVE NOT SEEN THE LANGUAGE

02:38:38.442 --> 02:38:39.443
OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT

02:38:39.509 --> 02:38:40.844
THEY'RE JUST DISCUSSIONS THAT

02:38:40.911 --> 02:38:42.946
ARE TAKING PLACE -- FROM OUR

02:38:43.013 --> 02:38:45.082
PERSPECTIVE WE ARE THE THE

02:38:45.148 --> 02:38:47.084
ADMINISTRATION'S PER PROPOSAL

02:38:47.150 --> 02:38:48.385
INCLUDES USING THAT USUAL NEEDS

02:38:48.452 --> 02:38:49.353
ASSESSMENT WHICH HAS BEEN THE

02:38:49.419 --> 02:38:50.387
HISTORICAL.

02:38:50.454 --> 02:38:51.622
METHOD FOR DOING AND THAT REALLY

02:38:51.688 --> 02:38:54.424
FOCUSES ON USING WORKLOAD AS THE

02:38:54.491 --> 02:38:58.729
BASIS FOR IT -- ACROSS THE STATE.

02:38:58.795 --> 02:39:00.030
OKAY START MISSILE.

02:39:00.097 --> 02:39:01.865
I'M COMFORTED THAT YOU HAVEN'T

02:39:01.932 --> 02:39:02.366
SEEN IT EITHER BECAUSE I

02:39:02.432 --> 02:39:03.901
COULDN'T GET IT.

02:39:03.967 --> 02:39:05.035
I AM.

02:39:05.102 --> 02:39:07.971
VERY CONCERNED ABOUT USING ABOUT

02:39:08.038 --> 02:39:09.139
THE LEGISLATURE PUTTING THEIR

02:39:09.206 --> 02:39:10.641
HANDS ON THIS ISSUE AND TURNING

02:39:10.707 --> 02:39:12.075
THIS INTO A POLITICAL FOOTBALL I

02:39:12.142 --> 02:39:13.110
THINK THAT ALLOWING THE JUDICIAL

02:39:13.176 --> 02:39:14.611
COUNCIL TO ALLOCATE.

02:39:14.678 --> 02:39:15.913
THE JUDGES IS THE APPROPRIATE

02:39:15.979 --> 02:39:17.214
WAY OF DOING IT I THINK THE

02:39:17.281 --> 02:39:18.448
RELYING ON A JUDICIAL NEEDS

02:39:18.515 --> 02:39:19.683
ASSESSMENT THAT NONE OF US HAVE

02:39:19.750 --> 02:39:21.318
SEEN IS A FAIR WAY OF DOING IT

02:39:21.385 --> 02:39:22.386
BECAUSE NO ONE SECOND SAY FOR

02:39:22.452 --> 02:39:23.186
SURE.

02:39:23.253 --> 02:39:24.488
WHO WOULD GET WHAT AND -- SO I

02:39:24.554 --> 02:39:25.789
WOULD BE STRONGLY SUPPORTIVE OF

02:39:25.856 --> 02:39:28.292
KEEPING IT THAT WAY INSTEAD OF

02:39:28.358 --> 02:39:28.859
INSTEAD OF TRYING TO MAKE IT

02:39:28.926 --> 02:39:30.327
MORE COMPLEX.

02:39:30.394 --> 02:39:33.997
THANK YOU OTHER COMMENTS SENATOR

02:39:34.064 --> 02:39:35.332
SKINNER ACTUALLY THE JUDICIAL

02:39:35.399 --> 02:39:37.034
COUNCILS NEEDS ASSESSMENT.

02:39:37.100 --> 02:39:39.336
HAS ALREADY NUMBERS SO IT IS NOT

02:39:39.403 --> 02:39:41.071
SOMETHING NO ONE HAS SEEN.

02:39:41.138 --> 02:39:43.774
AND THERE IS A GREAT DEAL OF

02:39:43.840 --> 02:39:44.975
DEBATE.

02:39:45.042 --> 02:39:46.343
EVEN AMONGST.

02:39:46.410 --> 02:39:48.879
SOME MEMBERS NOT ALL OF THE

02:39:48.946 --> 02:39:50.247
JUDICIAL COUNCIL AROUND.

02:39:50.314 --> 02:39:56.086
THE IT'S LIKE ANY ANY -- ANY

02:39:56.153 --> 02:39:58.422
TABLE ONE DEVELOPS OR ANY SET OF

02:39:58.488 --> 02:39:59.723
CRITERIA ONE DEVELOPS TO

02:39:59.790 --> 02:40:01.858
DETERMINE A WORKLOAD DEPENDS ON

02:40:01.925 --> 02:40:02.893
WHAT.

02:40:02.960 --> 02:40:06.496
OUR CRITERIA OR PUT IN THE MIX

02:40:06.563 --> 02:40:07.264
RIGHT.

02:40:07.331 --> 02:40:10.334
AND SO THERE IS SOME DEBATE AS

02:40:10.400 --> 02:40:13.537
TO WHETHER -- IT YOU KNOW WHAT

02:40:13.603 --> 02:40:16.239
TYPE OF WHETHER CERTAIN TYPE A

02:40:16.306 --> 02:40:17.941
TRIAL NEEDS HAVE BEEN.

02:40:18.008 --> 02:40:21.111
WAITED AS MUCH AS OTHERS AND

02:40:21.178 --> 02:40:23.280
WHICH CAN OF COURSE INFLUENCE

02:40:23.347 --> 02:40:25.749
THEN WHAT IS THE WORKLOAD IN

02:40:25.816 --> 02:40:27.217
THAT PARTICULAR.

02:40:27.284 --> 02:40:30.320

02:40:35.993 --> 02:40:37.928
JUDGES -- JUDICIAL COUNCIL THINK

02:40:37.995 --> 02:40:40.597
IS NEEDED WE WOULDN'T HAVE TO BE

02:40:40.664 --> 02:40:44.134
LOOKING AT WHETHER THE WORKLOAD.

02:40:44.201 --> 02:40:45.302

CONSTRUED IS THE IS THE ONE THAT

02:40:47.738 --> 02:40:49.840
MOST REFLECTS THE NEED OR NOT

02:40:49.906 --> 02:40:52.109
BUT WHEN WE'RE ONLY FINDING

02:40:52.175 --> 02:40:53.977
TWENTY FIVE IT IS WORTH LOOKING

02:40:54.044 --> 02:40:57.280
AT THAT.

PINE AND CONTINGENT.

02:43:01.071 --> 02:43:03.273
UPON RECEIPT OF A REPORT TO THE

02:43:03.340 --> 02:43:04.508
LEGISLATURE AND HOW THE FUNDS

02:43:04.574 --> 02:43:06.176
HAVE BEEN AND ARE EXPECTED TO BE

02:43:06.243 --> 02:43:07.010
USED.

02:43:07.077 --> 02:43:08.011
THE ASSEMBLY APPROVED THE

02:43:08.078 --> 02:43:09.579
PROPOSAL AND ADOPTED PROVISIONAL

02:43:09.646 --> 02:43:11.448
BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE REQUIRING

02:43:11.515 --> 02:43:13.150

REPORTING ON THE USE OF THE

02:43:14.818 --> 02:43:16.219
FUNDS AND THE OUTCOMES ACHIEVED.

02:43:16.286 --> 02:43:17.554
THE CONFERENCE ISSUE IS THE

02:43:17.621 --> 02:43:18.688
TIMING OF THE RELEASE OF THE

02:43:18.755 --> 02:43:21.658
FUNDS AS WELL AS THE REPORTING

02:43:21.725 --> 02:43:23.160
REQUIREMENTS.

02:43:23.226 --> 02:43:24.027
US WE THINK BOTH HOUSES ACTIONS

02:43:24.094 --> 02:43:24.961
WOULD INCREASE INCREASE

02:43:25.028 --> 02:43:26.396
LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT WE THINK

02:43:26.463 --> 02:43:27.564
THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE

02:43:27.631 --> 02:43:28.932
THIS IS A NEW PROGRAM AND

02:43:28.999 --> 02:43:29.766
THERE'S A LIMITED AMOUNT OF

02:43:29.833 --> 02:43:31.668
INFORMATION AVAILABLE ON HOW

02:43:31.735 --> 02:43:33.370
THIS WILL BE IMPLEMENTED -- WE

02:43:33.436 --> 02:43:35.038
KNOW THAT THE TWO HOUSES

02:43:35.105 --> 02:43:36.373
APPROACHES ARE JUST SLIGHTLY

02:43:36.439 --> 02:43:38.642
DIFFERENT IN IN TERMS OF HOW

02:43:38.708 --> 02:43:39.943
THEY ACCOMPLISH THAT GOAL.

02:43:40.010 --> 02:43:41.011
SO ACCORDINGLY WE'RE

02:43:41.077 --> 02:43:42.546
RECOMMENDING A COMPROMISE THAT

02:43:42.612 --> 02:43:43.747
WOULD PROVIDE TWO KINDS OF

02:43:43.813 --> 02:43:45.949
REPORTS THE FIRST ONE WOULD BE

02:43:46.016 --> 02:43:48.718
REPORT EARLY ON IT COULD BE --

02:43:48.785 --> 02:43:50.687
TRIGGERED BY SOME DATES -- OR

02:43:50.754 --> 02:43:52.022
THE EXPENSE CERTAIN EXPENDITURE

02:43:52.088 --> 02:43:52.989
LEVEL FOR EXAMPLE THE

02:43:53.056 --> 02:43:54.124
LEGISLATURE COULD REQUIRED TO

02:43:54.191 --> 02:43:55.892
REPORT OUT FRONT -- AND THAT

02:43:55.959 --> 02:43:58.195
WOULD PROVIDE THE GOVERNOR'S

02:43:58.261 --> 02:43:59.696
PLAN FOR HOW -- HOW HE INTENDS

02:43:59.763 --> 02:44:01.698
TO USE THE FUNDS AND THEN SECOND

02:44:01.765 --> 02:44:03.300
WE WOULDRECOMMEND A REPORT

02:44:03.366 --> 02:44:05.035
AFTER THE FACT THAT IDENTIFIES

02:44:05.101 --> 02:44:07.537
HOW THE FUNDS WERE USED AND ALSO

02:44:07.604 --> 02:44:08.772
THE OUTCOMES THAT WERE ACHIEVED?

02:44:08.838 --> 02:44:10.106
ADDITIONALLY WE THINK OF THE

02:44:10.173 --> 02:44:11.608
LEGISLATURE HAS A CLEAR IDEA OF

02:44:11.675 --> 02:44:12.842
HOW IT ONCE THESE FUNDS TO GO

02:44:12.909 --> 02:44:14.711
OUT FOR EXAMPLE HOW MUCH TO

02:44:14.778 --> 02:44:16.246
LOCALS VERSUS STATE ENTITIES --

02:44:16.313 --> 02:44:17.514
IT CERTAINLY WOULD BE REASONABLE

02:44:17.581 --> 02:44:18.481
FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO PROVIDE

02:44:18.548 --> 02:44:21.151
THAT DIRECTION -- AT THIS TIME

02:44:21.218 --> 02:44:22.185
AS WELL.

02:44:22.252 --> 02:44:23.687
THANK YOU FINANCE WE BELIEVE

02:44:23.753 --> 02:44:25.055
THAT GIVEN THE NATUREOF THIS

02:44:25.121 --> 02:44:26.556
PROPOSAL IN THE FACT THAT IT IS

02:44:26.623 --> 02:44:28.091
A NEW PROPOSAL THAT FLEXIBILITY

02:44:28.158 --> 02:44:30.093
IS IMPORTANT AND WE'RE CURRENTLY

02:44:30.160 --> 02:44:31.328
WORKING WITH LEGISLATIVE STAFF

02:44:31.394 --> 02:44:32.963
ON HOW TO BALANCE THAT NEED FOR

02:44:33.029 --> 02:44:34.464
FLEXIBILITY WITH THE IMPORTANCE

02:44:34.531 --> 02:44:37.033
OF LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT.

02:44:37.100 --> 02:44:38.635

EXPIRED -- ADDITIONALLY THE

02:51:28.978 --> 02:51:30.780
SENATE PLAN ALSO REQUIRES DOJ

02:51:30.847 --> 02:51:31.981

02:51:35.785 --> 02:51:37.954
GONNA BE THE SECOND MAJOR

02:51:38.021 --> 02:51:38.488
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO

02:51:38.554 --> 02:51:39.422
HOUSES.

02:51:39.489 --> 02:51:40.023
SO IN THE FINAL PAGE OF YOUR

02:51:40.089 --> 02:51:41.824
HAND OUT PAGE THREE WE DO HAVE A

02:51:41.891 --> 02:51:43.526
COMPROMISE ON THIS ISSUE -- IT

02:51:43.593 --> 02:51:44.427

ONGOING GENERAL FUND SUPPORT FOR

02:51:52.235 --> 02:51:53.569
THE APP'S INVESTIGATION TEAMS

02:51:53.636 --> 02:51:55.471
JUST TO ENSURE THAT EXISTING

02:51:55.538 --> 02:51:57.073
FUNDING LEVELS ARE MAINTAINED --

02:51:57.140 --> 02:51:58.007

02:52:01.144 --> 02:52:01.878
ASSESSING THE HEALTH OF THE

02:52:01.944 --> 02:52:02.812
DRESS ACCOUNT AND THIS WOULD

02:52:02.879 --> 02:52:03.880
REALLY HELP INFORM THE

02:52:03.946 --> 02:52:05.448
LEGISLATURE'S DECISIONS MOVING

02:52:05.515 --> 02:52:07.884

02:52:07.950 --> 02:52:08.518

NEED TO BE TAKEN ON A RELATED TO

02:52:10.520 --> 02:52:12.655
SOLVENCY.

02:52:12.722 --> 02:52:15.258
THANK YOU SO MUCH -- FINANCE

02:52:16.626 --> 02:52:19.162
REVISION PROPOSAL.

02:52:19.228 --> 02:52:19.696
THANK YOU WE'LL START WITH

02:52:19.762 --> 02:52:22.765
SENATOR ROSS.

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR YOU KNOW --

02:52:24.901 --> 02:52:26.636
EVERY YEAR WE SEEM TO DISCUSS

02:52:26.703 --> 02:52:28.604
THIS ISSUE IN FUNDING AND

02:52:28.671 --> 02:52:30.606
BACKLOGS IN HOW WE'RE GOING TO

02:52:30.673 --> 02:52:32.075
CLEAR UP THE BACKLOG AND HOW

02:52:32.141 --> 02:52:33.242
WE'RE GOING TO PICK UP THESE

02:52:33.309 --> 02:52:35.011
FIREARMS FROM PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT

02:52:35.078 --> 02:52:36.846
SUPPOSED TO HAVE THEM.

02:52:36.913 --> 02:52:38.548
AND WE ARE COMMITTED THE DOJ

02:52:38.614 --> 02:52:41.150
BUDGETS AND ALLOW THEM TO HIRE

02:52:41.217 --> 02:52:42.685
MORE PEOPLE.

02:52:42.752 --> 02:52:44.887
AND I'M NOT SURE YOU CAN TELL ME

02:52:44.954 --> 02:52:46.823
I'M NOT SURE WE HAVE EVER BEEN

02:52:46.889 --> 02:52:47.957
ABLE TO GET AHEAD OF THE BOW

02:52:48.024 --> 02:52:49.459
WAVE.

02:52:49.525 --> 02:52:51.794
AND SO I GUESS MY QUESTION

02:52:51.861 --> 02:52:53.196
OBVIOUSLY WE'RE GOING TO SUPPORT.

02:52:53.262 --> 02:52:54.797
I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THIS

02:52:54.864 --> 02:52:57.166
BECAUSE WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.

02:52:57.233 --> 02:52:58.968
BUT WHY DO WE KEEP DOING IT THE

02:52:59.035 --> 02:53:00.536
SAME WAY.

02:53:00.603 --> 02:53:04.040
WILL BECOME PROHIBITED PERSONS.

02:53:04.107 --> 02:53:05.575
MY UNDERSTANDING IS.

02:53:05.641 --> 02:53:07.343
BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN IN THE

02:53:07.410 --> 02:53:08.411
COURT SYSTEM OR THE LAW

02:53:08.478 --> 02:53:10.213
ENFORCEMENT LOCAL LAW

02:53:10.279 --> 02:53:11.914
ENFORCEMENT SYSTEM AT SOME POINT.

02:53:11.981 --> 02:53:13.349
AND SOMETHING HAPPENS TO THEM

02:53:13.416 --> 02:53:14.817
THE PROHIBITS THEM FROM

02:53:14.884 --> 02:53:16.319
POSSESSING A FIREARM.

02:53:16.385 --> 02:53:18.955
WE WAIT UNTIL ALL THAT HAPPENS

02:53:19.021 --> 02:53:20.423
AND THEY DISAPPEAR INTO THE

02:53:20.490 --> 02:53:21.591
ETHER.

02:53:21.657 --> 02:53:22.959
AND THEN WE THROW MILLIONS OF

02:53:23.025 --> 02:53:26.662
DOLLARS THE DOJ WHO SENDS OUT A

02:53:26.729 --> 02:53:27.830
LIMITED NUMBER OF PEOPLE.

02:53:27.897 --> 02:53:29.565
OUT OVER THIS HUGE STATE WITH

02:53:29.632 --> 02:53:31.000
FORTY MILLION PEOPLE TO TRY TO

02:53:31.067 --> 02:53:32.535
FIND THESE FOLKS AND PICK UP

02:53:32.602 --> 02:53:33.703
FIREARMS.

02:53:33.770 --> 02:53:35.238
WHY IS IT THAT WE DON'T HAVE A

02:53:35.304 --> 02:53:36.506
SYSTEM WHERE WHEN THEY CYCLE

02:53:36.572 --> 02:53:38.241
THROUGH?

02:53:38.307 --> 02:53:39.675
OF THE PUBLIC SAFETY THE LAW

02:53:39.742 --> 02:53:41.410
ENFORCEMENT TO JUSTICE SYSTEM AT

02:53:41.477 --> 02:53:42.779
THE LOCAL LEVEL.

02:53:42.845 --> 02:53:44.914
WE WE GRABBED THE FIREARMS FROM

02:53:44.981 --> 02:53:47.283
THEM.

02:53:47.350 --> 02:53:49.519
BEFORE THEY LEAVE OUR SITE.

02:53:49.585 --> 02:53:51.654
AND WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT

02:53:51.721 --> 02:53:53.055
THE BACKLOG EXCEPT TO TRY TO

02:53:53.122 --> 02:53:54.857
WHITTLE IT DOWN.

02:53:54.924 --> 02:53:56.893
BUT MAYBE IT'S IN HERE AND I

02:53:56.959 --> 02:53:59.295
DON'T KNOW BUT MY PERCEPTION IS

02:53:59.362 --> 02:54:00.630
THERE'S NOTHING THEY WERE DOING

02:54:00.696 --> 02:54:03.032
AT THE FRONT END. TO TRY TO

02:54:03.099 --> 02:54:04.300
PREVENT THE BACKLOG.

02:54:04.367 --> 02:54:06.702
FROM OCCURRING.

02:54:06.769 --> 02:54:08.871
CAN CAN CAN SOMEONE [inaudible]

02:54:08.938 --> 02:54:10.640
ADDRESS THAT.

02:54:10.706 --> 02:54:12.208
IS IT BEING STUDIED IS A PLAN

02:54:12.275 --> 02:54:14.644
BEING DEVELOPED.

02:54:14.710 --> 02:54:17.480
IN MY OFF THE MARK -- AMADOR

02:54:17.547 --> 02:54:19.448
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I THINK --

02:54:19.515 --> 02:54:21.184
I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND YOUR

02:54:21.250 --> 02:54:22.718
CONCERNS WITH THIS AND I THINK

02:54:22.785 --> 02:54:24.387
THAT -- ATTORNEY GENERAL'S

02:54:24.453 --> 02:54:26.255
OFFICE AS HAS BEEN ESPECIALLY

02:54:26.322 --> 02:54:27.356
AFTER THIS NEW REPORT THAT

02:54:27.423 --> 02:54:28.491
THEY'VE AN ISSUE WHERE THEY

02:54:28.558 --> 02:54:30.526
REFINED THEIR APPS REVIEW LOOKED

02:54:30.593 --> 02:54:32.361
AT THE BACKLOG I THINK THEY HAVE

02:54:32.428 --> 02:54:34.163
CONCERNS AS WELL ABOUT -- WHAT

02:54:34.230 --> 02:54:35.631
YOU'VE EXPRESSED AND IT'S

02:54:35.698 --> 02:54:37.166
SOMETHING THAT WE ARE?

02:54:37.233 --> 02:54:39.735
WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT ON

02:54:39.802 --> 02:54:41.070
BUT LET ME BE MORE SPECIFIC.

02:54:41.137 --> 02:54:42.104
IF YOU'RE IN THE COURTS OF I

02:54:42.171 --> 02:54:44.340
DIDN'T DO CIVILIAN CRIMINAL LAW

02:54:44.407 --> 02:54:46.342
BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS IF

02:54:46.409 --> 02:54:48.477
YOU'RE IN THE COURT SYSTEM.

02:54:48.544 --> 02:54:49.879
AND YOU'RE IN A COURTROOM AND A

02:54:49.946 --> 02:54:51.080
JUDGE AND YOU'VE GOT A PLEA DEAL

02:54:51.147 --> 02:54:53.983
OR JUDGES ABOUT THE SENTENCE YOU.

02:54:54.050 --> 02:54:56.018
YOU'RE GONNA KNOW WHEN THE U. S.

02:54:56.085 --> 02:54:57.086
AS THE BECAUSE THE ACCUSED ARE

02:54:57.153 --> 02:54:58.287
GOING TO KNOW WHETHER YOU'RE

02:54:58.354 --> 02:54:59.522
ABLE TO POSSESS FIREARMS AND I

02:54:59.589 --> 02:55:01.190
MAY EVEN BE SOME ORDER THAT THE

02:55:01.257 --> 02:55:02.358
JUDGE SIGNS.

02:55:02.425 --> 02:55:05.528
WHY IS IT WHEN THAT INDIVIDUAL

02:55:05.595 --> 02:55:06.963
LEAVES THE COURTROOM?

02:55:07.029 --> 02:55:08.531
HAVING ACCEPTED THE PLEA DEAL

02:55:08.598 --> 02:55:10.132
EITHER BEFORE SENTENCING -- AT

02:55:10.199 --> 02:55:11.767
THE TIME OF SENTENCING THAT

02:55:11.834 --> 02:55:13.102
THERE'S NOT SOMEBODY COLLECTING

02:55:13.169 --> 02:55:15.404
THOSE FIREARMS AT THAT POINT.

02:55:15.471 --> 02:55:16.572
AND THAT'S WHAT I'D LIKE FOR

02:55:16.639 --> 02:55:18.241
SOMEBODY TO THINK ABOUT BECAUSE

02:55:18.307 --> 02:55:21.043
I SUSPECT THAT THE COST OF DOING

02:55:21.110 --> 02:55:22.812
THAT THE INCREMENTAL COST TO

02:55:22.879 --> 02:55:24.580
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT TO THE

02:55:24.647 --> 02:55:25.715
JUDICIARY.

02:55:25.781 --> 02:55:27.783
IS GOING TO BE A HECK OF A LOT

02:55:27.850 --> 02:55:29.585
LESS THAN IT IS.

02:55:29.652 --> 02:55:31.187
DOING IT ON THE BACKEND WHERE

02:55:31.254 --> 02:55:32.855
THEY FALL INTO THE BACKLOG WE

02:55:32.922 --> 02:55:35.825
HIRE ADDITIONAL INVESTIGATORS

02:55:35.892 --> 02:55:37.894
ONE FORCE FROM PEOPLE WATCHING

02:55:37.960 --> 02:55:40.830
AND PLANES AND CARS. TO TO GO

02:55:40.897 --> 02:55:43.032
HOUSE TO HOUSE TRYING TO FIND

02:55:43.099 --> 02:55:44.400
FOLKS.

02:55:44.467 --> 02:55:46.969
I'LL STOP GIVING A SPEECH BUT A

02:55:47.036 --> 02:55:48.905
WE HEAR THE YOU KNOW AND NO.

02:55:48.971 --> 02:55:50.940
I'M NOT CRITICIZING BUT THAT'S

02:55:51.007 --> 02:55:52.275
THE SAME ISSUE EVERY YEAR.

02:55:52.341 --> 02:55:53.876
AND WE HAVEN'T COME UP WITH A

02:55:53.943 --> 02:55:57.179

ITEM THE FORCE FIRST ACTUALLY

02:56:11.427 --> 02:56:14.030
DOJ HAS DONE A VERY DECENT JOB

02:56:14.096 --> 02:56:17.199
ON GETTING -- MAKING PROGRESS ON

02:56:17.266 --> 02:56:18.467
THAT BACKLOG.

02:56:18.534 --> 02:56:20.369
AND CONSIDERING THAT THE

02:56:20.436 --> 02:56:22.805
LEGISLATURE HAS -- APPROVED

02:56:22.872 --> 02:56:24.674
ADDITIONAL LEGISLATION THAT IS

SUB FIVE IN THE SENATE DON'T

02:56:42.391 --> 02:56:43.426
WITH AFTER.

02:56:43.492 --> 02:56:44.994
DISCUSSING THIS ISSUE AND HAVE

02:56:45.061 --> 02:56:46.629
BEING BOTH IN FOR INFORMATION

02:56:46.696 --> 02:56:48.664
HEARINGS AND HEARINGS ON THE

02:56:48.731 --> 02:56:50.132
PARTICULAR BCP'S.

02:56:50.199 --> 02:56:52.268
IS THAT OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF

02:56:52.335 --> 02:56:53.069
YEARS.

02:56:53.135 --> 02:56:54.537
THE BUDGETS WE'VE APPROVED HAVE

02:56:54.603 --> 02:56:57.206
INCREASED FUNDING AND POSITIONS

02:56:57.273 --> 02:56:59.542
TO DOJ TO DEAL WITH APPS.

02:56:59.608 --> 02:57:01.911
NOW THE POSITIONS AT DOJ HAVE

02:57:01.978 --> 02:57:03.579
NOT THEY'VE GONE ON FILLED NOT

02:57:03.646 --> 02:57:04.246
ALL.

02:57:04.313 --> 02:57:05.648
BUT THERE CONTINUES TO BE

02:57:05.715 --> 02:57:07.650
VACANCY AND WHAT WE HEAR FROM

02:57:07.717 --> 02:57:09.085
THE DEPARTMENT IS THAT SOME OF

02:57:09.151 --> 02:57:11.320
THAT IS DUE.

02:57:11.387 --> 02:57:13.189
TO EITHER AT THE CLASSIFICATION

02:57:13.255 --> 02:57:14.790
OF THOSE POSITIONS FOR SOME

02:57:14.857 --> 02:57:16.425
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING ISSUES I'M

02:57:16.492 --> 02:57:18.060
NOT EXACTLY SURE.

02:57:18.127 --> 02:57:20.429
BUT BASICALLY THEIR ABILITY TO

02:57:20.496 --> 02:57:24.900
EITHER HIRE PEOPLE RETAIN PEOPLE

02:57:24.967 --> 02:57:28.337
IT CHALLENGING NOW GIVEN ACT.

02:57:28.404 --> 02:57:30.373
IT SEEMED TO US AND THAT WASN'T

02:57:30.439 --> 02:57:33.109
SOMETHING THAT WE COULD FIX JUST

02:57:33.175 --> 02:57:34.877
WITH A TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE.

02:57:34.944 --> 02:57:37.413
THAT IF WE CONTINUED TO GIVE NEW

02:57:37.480 --> 02:57:40.383
FUNDING FOR NEW POSITIONS JUST

02:57:40.449 --> 02:57:42.051
HAPPEN VACANT I MEAN THE FUNDING

02:57:42.118 --> 02:57:43.352

POSITIONS ARE VACANT.

02:57:44.620 --> 02:57:48.124
SO WE LOOKED AT THE FACT THAT.

02:57:48.190 --> 02:57:53.195
THIS IS SOMETHING THE THE WITH

02:57:53.262 --> 02:57:56.098
RETRIEVAL OF WEAPONS FROM FOLKS

02:57:56.165 --> 02:57:57.400
WHO ARE ON THIS PROHIBITED

02:57:57.466 --> 02:57:58.501
PERSONS IST.

02:57:58.567 --> 02:57:59.935
HAS BEEN IN CAN BE THERE'S

02:58:00.002 --> 02:58:01.103
NOTHING IN OUR STATUTE THE

02:58:01.170 --> 02:58:03.305
PREVENTS LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT

02:58:03.372 --> 02:58:04.974
FROM DOING THIS AND IN FACT.

02:58:05.041 --> 02:58:06.108
MANY LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT

02:58:06.175 --> 02:58:08.244
AGENCIES ARE HAPPY TO BECAUSE IT

02:58:08.310 --> 02:58:10.613
ASSIST THEM ADDITIONALLY.

02:58:10.679 --> 02:58:11.547
THAT.

02:58:11.614 --> 02:58:13.716
IF IN GIVEN THAT WE HAVE LOCAL

02:58:13.783 --> 02:58:15.117
LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES

02:58:15.184 --> 02:58:17.620
EVERYWHERE EVERYWHERE IN THE

02:58:17.686 --> 02:58:18.654
STATE.

02:58:18.721 --> 02:58:21.624
AND IT WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT

02:58:21.690 --> 02:58:24.326
FOR US TO BRING DOJ UP TO THE

02:58:24.393 --> 02:58:26.362
LEVEL OF STAFFING TO GIVE THEM I

02:58:26.429 --> 02:58:27.797
MEAN THERE'S NO WAY WE CAN GIVE

02:58:27.863 --> 02:58:29.031
THEM THE TYPE OF PHYSICAL OR

02:58:29.098 --> 02:58:31.133
GEOGRAPHIC PRESENCE THAT OUR

02:58:31.200 --> 02:58:33.536
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT HOUSE.

02:58:33.602 --> 02:58:34.637
SO WE FELT THAT.

02:58:34.703 --> 02:58:36.572
KNOWING THAT WE'RE PUTTING MORE

02:58:36.639 --> 02:58:38.941
PEOPLE IN THE ARMED -- IMPROVE

02:58:39.008 --> 02:58:40.476
THE PERSON'S LIST.

02:58:40.543 --> 02:58:44.447
AND THAT DOJ'S HAD DIFFICULTY.

02:58:44.513 --> 02:58:46.315
FILLING POSITIONS THAT WE NEEDED

02:58:46.382 --> 02:58:48.517
TO EXPAND ME BE MORE CREATIVE SO

02:58:48.584 --> 02:58:50.519
WHILE WE DID NOT.

02:58:50.586 --> 02:58:52.555
ENTERTAIN WHAT -- MY COLLEAGUE

02:58:52.621 --> 02:58:54.290
SENATOR ROTH JUST RECOMMENDED

02:58:54.356 --> 02:58:55.791
AND CERTAINLY THAT SOMETHING IS

02:58:55.858 --> 02:58:58.427
WORTH US LOOKING AT NEXT YEAR.

02:58:58.494 --> 02:59:00.963
WE DID LOOK AT WELL WHO ELSE CAN

02:59:01.030 --> 02:59:02.932
HELP US WITH THIS WORK LOCAL LAW

02:59:02.998 --> 02:59:04.166
ENFORCEMENT.

02:59:04.233 --> 02:59:06.235
AND WE KNOW IN THE PAST I MEAN

02:59:06.302 --> 02:59:08.070
EVEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS

02:59:08.137 --> 02:59:10.139
PROVIDED MONEY TO OUR LOCAL LAW

02:59:10.206 --> 02:59:11.807
ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES IN MY OWN

02:59:11.874 --> 02:59:14.143
DISTRICT -- FOR EXAMPLE THE

02:59:14.210 --> 02:59:15.778
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE GAVE THE

02:59:15.845 --> 02:59:17.746
CITY OF OAKLAND A GREAT DEAL OF

02:59:17.813 --> 02:59:22.218
MONEY A COUPLE YEARS AGO. TO TO

02:59:22.284 --> 02:59:23.352
BASICALLY.

02:59:23.419 --> 02:59:25.488
RETRIEVE WEAPONS FROM EVERYBODY

02:59:25.554 --> 02:59:26.989
THAT WAS ON THE APPS LIST THAT

02:59:27.056 --> 02:59:29.725
HAD AN ADDRESS ASSOCIATED WITH

02:59:29.792 --> 02:59:30.860
OAKLAND THAT YOU KNOW HAVE.

02:59:30.926 --> 02:59:32.962
THE THERE WAS EVIDENCE THAT THEY

02:59:33.028 --> 02:59:33.596
STILL WERE.

02:59:33.662 --> 02:59:36.065
HE HAD WEAPONS AND THAT GREAT

02:59:36.132 --> 02:59:38.968
THAT ASSISTED DOJ GREATLY OUR

02:59:39.034 --> 02:59:41.337
OWN DOJ ON TO WITHOUT BACK LIKE

02:59:41.403 --> 02:59:41.937
SO.

02:59:42.004 --> 02:59:44.206
KNOWING THAT WE HAVE BOTH THE

02:59:44.273 --> 02:59:46.142
INTEREST LOCALLY AND THE ABILITY

02:59:46.208 --> 02:59:48.811
LOCALLY IT SEEMS WE SHOULD.

02:59:48.878 --> 02:59:51.447
JOIN TOGETHER AND SO THAT WAS

02:59:51.514 --> 02:59:53.182
ONE PURPOSE OF SUPPORTING THE

02:59:53.249 --> 02:59:55.818
THIS PILOT AND CERTAINLY.

02:59:55.885 --> 02:59:57.319
WE KNOW THAT LOCAL LAW

02:59:57.386 --> 03:00:00.055
ENFORCEMENT IT CAN WORK BUT WE

03:00:00.122 --> 03:00:02.491
WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT IT WAS

03:00:02.558 --> 03:00:04.160
DONE IN A WAY THAT ALSO

03:00:04.226 --> 03:00:07.997
COORDINATES WITH DOJ BECAUSE DOJ --

03:00:08.063 --> 03:00:09.064
HAS INDICATED IN HEARINGS THAT

03:00:09.131 --> 03:00:10.633
THERE'S TIMES WHEN THEY DON'T

03:00:10.699 --> 03:00:12.401
HEAR FROM LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT

03:00:12.468 --> 03:00:13.969
WHEN DAVE RETREAT WEAPONS BUT

03:00:14.036 --> 03:00:15.171
CERTAINLY THOSE ARE THINGS WE

03:00:15.237 --> 03:00:18.908
CAN PUT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS

03:00:18.974 --> 03:00:22.111
AND SUCH -- SO THAT'S WHAT WE

03:00:22.178 --> 03:00:23.078
ARE TRYING TO CHEAT WE ARE

03:00:23.145 --> 03:00:25.814
TRYING TO ACHIEVE HOW.

03:00:25.881 --> 03:00:27.149
TO BE THE SMARTEST USE OF OUR

03:00:27.216 --> 03:00:28.617
RESOURCES AND ACCOMPLISH THE

03:00:28.684 --> 03:00:29.718
GOALS.

03:00:29.785 --> 03:00:32.454
ON NOW FINALLY WHY DID WE NOT

03:00:32.521 --> 03:00:35.224
CONTINUE GENERAL FUND ON GOING.

03:00:35.291 --> 03:00:38.527
THE FRUSTRATION HERE IS THAT.

03:00:38.594 --> 03:00:40.462
THE SPECIAL FUNDS SUCH AS THE

03:00:40.529 --> 03:00:42.031
DROSS ACCOUNT THE OTHERS WERE

03:00:42.097 --> 03:00:44.400
DESIGNED WE WE CREATED THESE

03:00:44.466 --> 03:00:48.537
FEES. TO SUPPORT THIS ACTIVITY.

03:00:48.604 --> 03:00:52.041
AND IF WE MOVE TO LONG TERM

03:00:52.107 --> 03:00:53.275
GENERAL FUND THEN WE'RE

03:00:53.342 --> 03:00:54.643
BASICALLY SET WHAT'S THE POINT

03:00:54.710 --> 03:00:55.945
OF THE FEES.

03:00:56.011 --> 03:00:58.514
SO WE WANTED. TO PUT IT BACK ON

03:00:58.581 --> 03:01:00.716
DOJ TO COME BACK TO US.

03:01:00.783 --> 03:01:03.052
BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO

03:01:03.118 --> 03:01:05.321
ADJUST THESE FEES AND WHAT WOULD

03:01:05.387 --> 03:01:06.922
BE THE ADJUSTMENTS THAT MIGHT BE

03:01:06.989 --> 03:01:10.492
NECESSARY IN ORDER. TO BRING IN

03:01:10.559 --> 03:01:12.494
THE MONEY IS NEEDED TO

03:01:12.561 --> 03:01:14.930
ACCOMPLISH WHAT IT TO TO

03:01:14.997 --> 03:01:16.632
BASICALLY FULLY IMPLEMENT OUR

03:01:16.699 --> 03:01:19.835
APPS PROGRAM.

03:01:19.902 --> 03:01:21.103
SO WE DID NOT WANT.

03:01:21.170 --> 03:01:23.339
TO ROOF A LONG TERM GENERAL FUND

03:01:23.405 --> 03:01:25.007
AND GET EVERYBODY USED TO OR

03:01:25.074 --> 03:01:26.942
DEPENDENT ON USING GENERAL FUND

03:01:27.009 --> 03:01:28.510
FOR THIS PURPOSE WHEN WE HAVE

03:01:28.577 --> 03:01:29.778
SPECIAL FUNDS.

03:01:29.845 --> 03:01:31.847
SO I WAS A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED

03:01:31.914 --> 03:01:33.382
WITH THE ALEJO'S COMPROMISE ONLY

03:01:33.449 --> 03:01:35.251
BECAUSE USUALLY THE LA ALWAYS

03:01:35.317 --> 03:01:37.586
REMINDING US OF THE FACT THAT

03:01:37.653 --> 03:01:39.054
WHEN WE HAVE A GENERAL FUND.

03:01:39.121 --> 03:01:41.824
WE SHOULD BE RELYING ON GENERAL

03:01:41.890 --> 03:01:43.425
FUND AS MUCH I MEAN.

03:01:43.492 --> 03:01:44.927
WHEN WE HAVE A SPECIAL FIND WE

03:01:44.994 --> 03:01:46.028
SHOULD BE RELYING ON SPECIAL

03:01:46.095 --> 03:01:47.329
FUND FOR THAT PURPOSE AND IF

03:01:47.396 --> 03:01:48.330
THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH THE

03:01:48.397 --> 03:01:49.632
SPECIAL FUNDS SHOULD BE?

03:01:49.698 --> 03:01:51.667
MAKING THE APPROPRIATE JUST

03:01:51.734 --> 03:01:54.136
MEANT TO CORRECT IT SO THAT'S

03:01:54.203 --> 03:01:55.838
WHERE THE SENATE WAS COMING FROM.

03:01:55.904 --> 03:01:57.706
AND CERTAINLY WE WANT OUR APPS

03:01:57.773 --> 03:02:00.943
PROGRAM TO ABSOLUTELY WORK BUT

03:02:01.010 --> 03:02:01.477
WE ARE TRYING.

03:02:01.543 --> 03:02:03.479
TO BE SMART ABOUT HOW TO MAKE IT

03:02:03.545 --> 03:02:07.016
WORK GIVEN THE GEOGRAPHIC SIZE

03:02:07.082 --> 03:02:08.784
OF OUR STATE [inaudible]

03:02:08.851 --> 03:02:09.385
WORKING [inaudible]

03:02:09.451 --> 03:02:12.488
ON YEAH [inaudible]

03:02:12.554 --> 03:02:16.292
YEAH.

03:02:16.358 --> 03:02:18.894
DOES ANYONE OUT THERE KNOW WHAT

03:02:18.961 --> 03:02:20.796
THE CURRENT BACKLOG IS.

03:02:20.863 --> 03:02:23.165
THE NUMBERS OF NOW.

03:02:23.232 --> 03:02:24.600
WHEN WESAY THE NUMBER OF

03:02:24.667 --> 03:02:26.535
FIREARMS THAT DOESN'T

03:02:26.602 --> 03:02:28.470
NECESSARILY RING TRUE WITH THE%

03:02:28.537 --> 03:02:30.739
NUMBER BECAUSE MANY OF THESE?

03:02:30.806 --> 03:02:31.940
INMATES HAVE MORE THAN ONE

03:02:32.007 --> 03:02:32.808
WEAPON.

03:02:32.875 --> 03:02:35.177
BUT IF SAFE.

03:02:35.244 --> 03:02:36.345
THE LAST FIGURE I HEARD WENT

03:02:36.412 --> 03:02:37.946
FROM TWENTY ONE THOUSAND AND

03:02:38.013 --> 03:02:40.082
ABOUT TWO YEARS.

03:02:40.149 --> 03:02:40.649
TO TEN THOUSAND WHERE ARE WE

03:02:40.716 --> 03:02:41.850
TODAY.

03:02:41.917 --> 03:02:43.218
NUMBERS HAVE BEEN INCREASING TO

03:02:43.285 --> 03:02:44.887
SOME DEGREE NOT SUBSTANTIALLY I

03:02:44.953 --> 03:02:46.455
DON'T THINK BUT WHAT WHAT'S THE

03:02:46.522 --> 03:02:49.191
NUMBER OF ON ON THE CONFISCATED

03:02:49.258 --> 03:02:51.660
FIREARMS TODAY.

03:02:51.727 --> 03:02:52.695
MANY.

03:02:52.761 --> 03:02:55.364
CURRENT BUT THE NUMBER.

03:02:55.431 --> 03:02:56.865
I THINK THE LAST NUMBERS THAT WE

03:02:56.932 --> 03:02:58.634
HAVE ARE FROM THE APPS REPORT

03:02:58.701 --> 03:03:00.235
THAT THEY DID IN JANUARY AT THE

03:03:00.302 --> 03:03:01.637
BEGINNING OF THIS YEAR.

03:03:01.704 --> 03:03:04.473
AND SO IN THAT REPORT -- I THINK

03:03:04.540 --> 03:03:05.441
THAT THEY'RE A COUPLE NUMBERS

03:03:05.507 --> 03:03:07.576
MENTION SO ALL KIND OF SPLIT

03:03:07.643 --> 03:03:10.979
THAT APART -- THERE WERE NINE

03:03:11.046 --> 03:03:11.914
THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND FOUR

03:03:11.980 --> 03:03:15.617
ACTIVE CASES AND THIRTEEN

03:03:15.684 --> 03:03:16.151
THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND

03:03:16.218 --> 03:03:18.187
EIGHTEEN PENDING CASES -- THE

03:03:18.253 --> 03:03:19.555
TEN THOUSAND NUMBER I THINK --

03:03:19.621 --> 03:03:21.957
YOU'RE REFERENCING TEN THOUSAND

03:03:22.024 --> 03:03:22.524
SIX HUNDRED AND EIGHTY ONE

03:03:22.591 --> 03:03:25.027
INDIVIDUALS WERE REMOVED FROM

03:03:25.094 --> 03:03:28.497
APPS -- AND THEN BUT ELEVEN

03:03:28.564 --> 03:03:29.031
THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND

03:03:29.098 --> 03:03:29.965
THIRTY THREE INDIVIDUALS WERE

03:03:30.032 --> 03:03:32.167
ADDED TO ABSENT SO.

03:03:32.234 --> 03:03:34.136
THERE'S KIND OF MOVEMENT BOTH IN

03:03:34.203 --> 03:03:35.738
AND OUT.

03:03:35.804 --> 03:03:37.306
BUT I DON'T I'M NOT GETTING A

03:03:37.373 --> 03:03:43.078
HEAD WE'RE GETTING BEHIND. EIGHT

03:03:43.145 --> 03:03:44.646
IN THAT LONG IN WORKING WITH DOJ

03:03:44.713 --> 03:03:46.348
ON THIS ON THIS B. C. P. AND

03:03:46.415 --> 03:03:48.117
ALSO RELATED TO THIS MOST RECENT

03:03:48.183 --> 03:03:49.785
REPORTING I THINK THAT THERE ARE

03:03:49.852 --> 03:03:51.019
QUESTIONS ABOUT.

03:03:51.086 --> 03:03:52.955
HOW THE DATA WAS IDENTIFIED AND

03:03:53.021 --> 03:03:54.189
HOW IT WAS BROKEN DOWN SO TO

03:03:54.256 --> 03:03:55.324
GIVE AN EXAMPLE ON SOME OF THE

03:03:55.391 --> 03:03:56.592
PENDING CASES?

03:03:56.658 --> 03:03:57.559
THEY WERE ABLE TO KIND OF

03:03:57.626 --> 03:03:58.894
FURTHER BREAK IT OUT INTO THINGS

03:03:58.961 --> 03:04:01.230
LIKE -- WHERE THEY WERE UNABLE

03:04:01.296 --> 03:04:02.364
TO LOCATE THE INDIVIDUAL THE

03:04:02.431 --> 03:04:04.066
INDIVIDUALS OUT OF STATE OR IF

03:04:04.133 --> 03:04:06.201
THE ONLY PROHIBITION WAS RELATED

03:04:06.268 --> 03:04:07.169
TO A FEDERAL PROHIBITION WAS

03:04:07.236 --> 03:04:07.536
SEWED?

03:04:07.603 --> 03:04:09.805
STATE DOJ DOESN'T REALLY HAVE A

03:04:09.872 --> 03:04:10.806
FORTY OVER THAT AND AND SO I

03:04:10.873 --> 03:04:12.574
THINK ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT

03:04:12.641 --> 03:04:14.543
BOTH HOUSES TOOK ON IN ADOPTING

03:04:14.610 --> 03:04:16.311
THE REPORTING LANGUAGE WAS TO

03:04:16.378 --> 03:04:17.346
ENSURE THAT THAT INFORMATION

03:04:17.413 --> 03:04:18.747
STILL CAME IN.

03:04:18.814 --> 03:04:19.782
AND THAT THE LEGISLATURE COULD

03:04:19.848 --> 03:04:22.184
KEEP MONITORING IT AND COULD

03:04:22.251 --> 03:04:23.519
DECIDE WHAT TO DO IN.

03:04:23.585 --> 03:04:25.854
SUBSEQUENT YEARS WITH THAT DATA

03:04:25.921 --> 03:04:29.525
THE TROUBLE IS MA'AM EVERY YEAR

03:04:29.591 --> 03:04:30.959
WE'VE GOTTEN DIFFERENT

03:04:31.026 --> 03:04:31.260
[inaudible]

03:04:31.326 --> 03:04:32.594
VERSIONS OKAY.

03:04:32.661 --> 03:04:35.764
LAST YEAR THE BIG REASON.

03:04:35.831 --> 03:04:37.833
THAT THE BACKLOG WE PUT IN AT

03:04:37.900 --> 03:04:39.835
LEAST UP WELL OVER FORTY MILLION

03:04:39.902 --> 03:04:42.070
DOLLARS OVER TWO YEAR PERIOD AND

03:04:42.137 --> 03:04:43.906
WE'RE IT WAS REPRESENTED BEFORE

03:04:43.972 --> 03:04:45.841
OUR COMMITTEE.

03:04:45.908 --> 03:04:47.443
BY DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE THAT'LL

03:04:47.509 --> 03:04:50.078
GET RID OF THE BACKLOG IT DIDN'T.

03:04:50.145 --> 03:04:51.747
THAT WAS THREE YEARS AGO WE'RE

03:04:51.814 --> 03:04:54.683
STILL DEALING WITH THE BACKLOG.

03:04:54.750 --> 03:04:56.885
WHAT WAS ONE OF THE REASONS?

03:04:56.952 --> 03:04:58.787
WE DEPARTMENT JUSTICE CANNOT

03:04:58.854 --> 03:05:03.725
COMPETE. FOR EMPLOYEES FOR SWORN

03:05:03.792 --> 03:05:04.927
OFFICERS WITH PRIVATE.

03:05:04.993 --> 03:05:06.161
EXCUSE ME WITH WITH THE LOCAL

03:05:06.228 --> 03:05:07.729
GOVERNMENT.

03:05:07.796 --> 03:05:10.432
CHAU THOUGH WE HAVE THE MONEY.

03:05:10.499 --> 03:05:11.767
WE CAN'T FIND ANYBODY TO HIGHER

03:05:11.834 --> 03:05:14.136
SO THAT WAS A REASON.

03:05:14.203 --> 03:05:16.238
THAT WAS OFFERED UP.

03:05:16.305 --> 03:05:19.074
AND SO THEY DIDN'T GET HIRED.

03:05:19.141 --> 03:05:20.576
WELL WE ACTUALLY TRIED THIS

03:05:20.642 --> 03:05:24.279
PILOT. FIVE MILLION DOLLARS I

03:05:24.346 --> 03:05:26.682
BELIEVE IT WAS LAST YEAR IT WAS

03:05:26.748 --> 03:05:27.983
PUT IN THE BUDGET FOR LOCAL

03:05:28.050 --> 03:05:30.519
GOVERNMENT.

03:05:30.586 --> 03:05:31.820
IT WAS ONE OF THE THINGS I

03:05:31.887 --> 03:05:33.121
INSISTED ON IF YOU CAN'T DO IT

03:05:33.188 --> 03:05:35.123
LET'S GIVE IT TO SOMEBODY ELSE

03:05:35.190 --> 03:05:35.858
WHO CAN MAYBE DO IT.

03:05:35.924 --> 03:05:37.326
LOCAL GOVERNMENT.

03:05:37.392 --> 03:05:40.596
THAT MONEY DID NOT GET SPENT.

03:05:40.662 --> 03:05:42.030
THAT WAS PRETTY OFFENSIVE LAST

03:05:42.097 --> 03:05:44.266
YEAR TO FIND THAT OUT WE PUT

03:05:44.333 --> 03:05:45.000
FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR FIVE

03:05:45.067 --> 03:05:47.336
MILLION. TO HELP GIVE IT TO

03:05:47.402 --> 03:05:47.970
LOCAL GOVERNMENT YOU GO DO IT

03:05:48.036 --> 03:05:49.438
THEN.

03:05:49.505 --> 03:05:52.140
THAT DIDN'T GET SPENT.

03:05:52.207 --> 03:05:53.308
PARDON THE TWENTY SIXTH.

03:05:53.375 --> 03:05:55.310
AND TWENTY I'M SURE THAT WAS

03:05:55.377 --> 03:05:57.412
TWENTY SIXTEEN NOT [inaudible]

03:05:57.479 --> 03:05:59.515
SEVENTY OR EIGHTEEN SO WE HAVE

03:05:59.581 --> 03:06:03.685
JUST POURED DOLLARS IN.

03:06:03.752 --> 03:06:05.888
THAT MADE NO REAL HEADWAY.

03:06:05.954 --> 03:06:07.789
AND THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE FOR

03:06:07.856 --> 03:06:09.424
YOU TO COME BACK AGAIN THIS YEAR

03:06:09.491 --> 03:06:11.426
AND SAY JUST ABOUT THE SAME

03:06:11.493 --> 03:06:13.695
THING THE BIG SAID JUST DIDN'T

03:06:13.762 --> 03:06:16.265
KNOW ONCE IT'S DIFFERENT OKAY.

03:06:16.331 --> 03:06:17.432
THE NEW WATCH IT.

03:06:17.499 --> 03:06:18.567
THIS YEAR IT'S NOT BEEN BROUGHT

03:06:18.634 --> 03:06:20.702
UP THAT THEY COULDN'T FIND

03:06:20.769 --> 03:06:22.738
ANYBODY TO HIRE.

03:06:22.804 --> 03:06:24.506
BECAUSE THEY CAN'T PAY AS MUCH.

03:06:24.573 --> 03:06:25.908
AS LOCAL GOVERNMENT.

03:06:25.974 --> 03:06:27.376
THE BOTTOM LINE THE PEOPLE OF

03:06:27.442 --> 03:06:29.912
CALIFORNIA ARE ILL SERVED.

03:06:29.978 --> 03:06:32.915
BY THIS INCOMPETENCE.

03:06:32.981 --> 03:06:33.549
AND I THINK THE FAILURE OF THE

03:06:33.615 --> 03:06:35.517
LEGISLATURE NOT TO BE FIRM

03:06:35.584 --> 03:06:37.019
ENOUGH TO ENSURE THAT THESE

03:06:37.085 --> 03:06:39.521
THESE GUNS COULD CONFISCATE.

03:06:39.588 --> 03:06:40.822
WE JUST SIT AROUND TALK ABOUT IT

03:06:40.889 --> 03:06:42.324
EVERY YEAR THROUGH A BUNCH OF

03:06:42.391 --> 03:06:44.026
WORDS UP IN THE AIR.

03:06:44.092 --> 03:06:46.194
AND REPEAT THE SAME OLD THING.

03:06:46.261 --> 03:06:49.531
THE FOLLOWING YEAR.

03:06:49.598 --> 03:06:51.266
SO IN EUROPE ENTREATIES ARE

03:06:51.333 --> 03:06:54.136
FALLING ON DEAF EARS HERE FOLKS.

03:06:54.202 --> 03:06:56.605
AND I RATHER PREDICT THAT THIS

03:06:56.672 --> 03:06:57.372
TIME NEXT YEAR.

03:06:57.439 --> 03:06:59.374
THE SAME COMMITTED.

03:06:59.441 --> 03:07:03.278
WE'RE GONNA HAVE THE SAME KIND-OF OBVIOUS CATIONS [inaudible]

03:07:03.345 --> 03:07:05.581
AND REPRESENTATIONS.

03:07:05.647 --> 03:07:08.383
AND VERY FEW IF ANY RESULT.

03:07:08.450 --> 03:07:09.384
NOW AND MAYBE YOU NEED TO GET

03:07:09.451 --> 03:07:11.520
SOME EXPERTS IN THAT KNOW HOW TO

03:07:11.587 --> 03:07:13.055
DO THIS BECAUSE WE'RE OBVIOUSLY

03:07:13.121 --> 03:07:15.190
NOT GETTING THERE BY THE CURRENT.

03:07:15.257 --> 03:07:17.626
TECHNIQUES MONEY SPENT.

03:07:17.693 --> 03:07:21.597

03:09:07.969 --> 03:09:10.072
BUT THE POINT IS.

03:09:10.138 --> 03:09:12.074

IT'S IT'S ADMINISTRATIVE MORE

03:12:24.966 --> 03:12:27.235
THAN I THINK BUDGETARY SO I

THINK.

03:12:27.702 --> 03:12:28.570
SENATOR.

03:12:28.637 --> 03:12:29.971

ISSUE OR CUT MAKING ITS A BUDGET

03:12:35.076 --> 03:12:35.810
ISSUE AND IT'S REALLY TO ME

03:12:35.877 --> 03:12:37.345
MAYBE A LITTLE DIFFERENT.

03:12:37.412 --> 03:12:39.080
AND SO ARE WE GOING TO HELP HIM

03:12:39.147 --> 03:12:42.517
HELP HIMSELF IF THAT MAKES SENSE

03:12:42.584 --> 03:12:43.118
IN IN GIVING HIM.

03:12:43.184 --> 03:12:44.786

03:12:44.853 --> 03:12:45.654
YOU KNOW BY MENTORING I DON'T

03:12:45.720 --> 03:12:47.455
KNOW WHAT IT IS BECAUSE IT'S A

03:12:47.522 --> 03:12:48.023
IT'S DIFFERENT WHEN YOU STEP

03:12:48.089 --> 03:12:50.525
INTO A DEPARTMENT HEAD POSITION

03:12:50.592 --> 03:12:51.893

03:12:58.733 --> 03:13:00.468
AND THEY'RE WORKING HARD BUT

03:13:00.535 --> 03:13:01.436
THEY'RE JUST NOT.

03:13:01.503 --> 03:13:02.437
HAVING A KEEPING THEIR

03:13:02.504 --> 03:13:04.406
MAINTAINING AT THE TEN THOUSAND

03:13:04.472 --> 03:13:06.007
LEVEL BUT THEY NEED.

03:13:06.074 --> 03:13:06.741
TO GO A LITTLE FURTHER.

03:13:06.808 --> 03:13:08.843
BUT HE HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO

03:13:08.910 --> 03:13:13.481
BUILD.

03:13:13.548 --> 03:13:15.450
LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AROUND

03:13:15.517 --> 03:13:18.019

03:13:35.503 --> 03:13:36.004
SIMPLE FIX AND I THINK WE'RE

03:13:36.071 --> 03:13:37.405
SPENDING.

03:13:37.472 --> 03:13:38.306
MAYBE MAYBE NOT ATTACKING IT THE

03:13:38.373 --> 03:13:39.174
WAY THAT THAT IT COULD BE DONE

03:13:39.240 --> 03:13:40.875

03:15:14.569 --> 03:15:16.905
SCALE IS LOWER THAN THAT OF WHAT.

03:15:16.971 --> 03:15:18.306
WOULD BE PAID BY SOMEONE AT A

03:15:18.373 --> 03:15:20.275
POLICE DEPARTMENT OR SHERIFF'S

SCALE CHART FOR THOSE POSITIONS

NOW THAT SHOULD BE DONE

03:15:29.451 --> 03:15:30.685
INTERNALLY.

03:15:30.752 --> 03:15:35.223
BETWEEN HIS DEPARTMENT AND

03:15:35.290 --> 03:15:38.226
NEWMAN RELATION GIVEN RESOURCE.

03:15:38.293 --> 03:15:39.260

ARMY JUST JUST TO FINISH WHAT.

03:15:41.830 --> 03:15:43.298
SENATOR.

03:15:43.364 --> 03:15:48.069
SENATOR MITCHELL RAT -- OF THE

03:15:48.136 --> 03:15:48.803
THE TEN THOUSAND SO WHO WERE

03:15:48.870 --> 03:15:50.839
TAKEN OFF.

03:15:50.905 --> 03:15:52.440
ON THE WAS REALLY ONLY

03:15:52.507 --> 03:15:54.709
400-010-0402 WHO WERE ACTUALLY --

03:15:54.776 --> 03:15:57.912
DISARMED. SIX THOUSAND TWO

03:15:57.979 --> 03:15:58.513
HUNDRED SIXTY EIGHT WERE TAKEN

03:15:58.580 --> 03:15:59.047
OUT BECAUSE THEIR MISSION

03:15:59.114 --> 03:15:59.314
EXPIRED.

03:15:59.380 --> 03:16:01.316
IN THE TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY

03:16:01.382 --> 03:16:04.052
ONE DIED SO AGAINST 60% OF THE

03:16:04.119 --> 03:16:04.853
TEN THOUSAND TAKEN OFF WERE

03:16:04.919 --> 03:16:07.088
ACTUALLY REMOVED NOT BECAUSE OF

03:16:07.155 --> 03:16:10.892
THEY WERE DISARMED BUT THEY NO

03:16:10.959 --> 03:16:11.526
LONGER PROHIBITED.

03:16:11.593 --> 03:16:14.696
ON IT THE DAY TO GIVE -- I I

03:16:14.762 --> 03:16:16.197
WOULD I WOULD HOPE AT LEAST FOR

03:16:16.264 --> 03:16:17.332
SENATOR NIELSEN COMES AYE AYE IS

03:16:17.398 --> 03:16:19.300
MUCH THE SAME COMMON TERMS OF

03:16:19.367 --> 03:16:19.834
THIS GETS DONE THIS GETS

03:16:19.901 --> 03:16:21.035
DISCUSSED -- EVERY SINGLE YEAR

03:16:21.102 --> 03:16:23.271
THIS IS MY FOURTH CONFERENCE

03:16:23.338 --> 03:16:25.039
COMMITTEE I THINK WE DISCUSSED

03:16:25.106 --> 03:16:25.840
EACH OF THOSE HE TO THOSE FOUR

03:16:25.907 --> 03:16:27.275
YEARS -- THE ONE THING THAT DOES

03:16:27.342 --> 03:16:30.478
GIVE ME A LITTLE BIT OF HOPE

03:16:30.545 --> 03:16:31.813
AGAIN WAS.

03:16:31.880 --> 03:16:34.516
HAVING THIS LOCAL PILOT.

03:16:34.582 --> 03:16:36.284
HAVING COUNTIES AND AND THE WAY

03:16:36.351 --> 03:16:39.320
THE COUNTIES WERE IDENTIFIED IS.

03:16:39.387 --> 03:16:40.788
THE SHERIFF OF THOSE COUNTIES

03:16:40.855 --> 03:16:43.491
WERE INTERESTED IN IN DOING SO

03:16:43.558 --> 03:16:44.692
THIS IS AGAIN NOT SOMETHING THAT

03:16:44.759 --> 03:16:45.827
WE ARE.

03:16:45.894 --> 03:16:48.463
TELLING PEOPLE BUT THAT WE ARE

03:16:48.530 --> 03:16:49.264
ASKING IF THERE ARE ANY

03:16:49.330 --> 03:16:51.366
VOLUNTEERS AND YOU HAD SOME

03:16:51.432 --> 03:16:51.900
COUNTIES WERE WILLING TO

03:16:51.966 --> 03:16:53.501
VOLUNTEER.

03:16:53.568 --> 03:16:55.103
AND I THINK THOSE COUNTIES FELT

03:16:55.170 --> 03:16:56.504
VERY COMFORTABLE BECAUSE THEY

03:16:56.571 --> 03:16:57.906
WERE ALREADY DOING THIS. TO

03:16:57.972 --> 03:16:59.374
ACTIVELY PUTTING INFORMATION TO

03:16:59.440 --> 03:17:00.842
THE DATABASE.

03:17:00.909 --> 03:17:04.512
THEY ARE ALSO -- ALREADY -- DO

03:17:04.579 --> 03:17:05.647
THIS AS PART OF THEIR DAILY WORK

03:17:05.713 --> 03:17:06.147
WITH THEY ARE DISARMING

03:17:06.214 --> 03:17:07.615
INDIVIDUALS IN THEIR OWN LOCAL

03:17:07.682 --> 03:17:10.251
JURISDICTIONS -- MY HOPE MY NO

03:17:10.318 --> 03:17:11.419
NO NO THIS THERE WAS A LITTLE

03:17:11.486 --> 03:17:13.555
BIT OF CONTENTION OF THIS

03:17:13.621 --> 03:17:15.623
PROPOSAL WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF

03:17:15.690 --> 03:17:16.624
JUSTICE.

03:17:16.691 --> 03:17:18.193
AND MY HOPE IS THAT THE ATTORNEY

03:17:18.259 --> 03:17:20.195
GENERAL IN THE DEPARTMENT WILL

03:17:20.261 --> 03:17:21.329
REALLY.

03:17:21.396 --> 03:17:22.130
KIND OF WORK WORK WITH US WORK

03:17:22.197 --> 03:17:29.204
WITH THOSE COUNTIES TO TRY TO

03:17:29.270 --> 03:17:31.072
FIGURE OUT HOW.

03:17:31.139 --> 03:17:32.307
TO REALLY LEVERAGE OUR STRENGTH

03:17:32.373 --> 03:17:33.975
AS A STATE AND REALLY LEVERAGE

03:17:34.042 --> 03:17:34.609
THE RESOURCES THAT ARE ALREADY

03:17:34.676 --> 03:17:35.910
THERE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL I THINK

03:17:35.977 --> 03:17:36.844
IT'S THIS IS THE SHOULD REALLY

03:17:36.911 --> 03:17:37.946
BE A STATE AND LOCAL PARTNERSHIP.

03:17:38.012 --> 03:17:38.846
WE'RE ALL TRYING TO DO THE SAME

03:17:38.913 --> 03:17:40.081
THING WE ALL HAVE THE SAME GOALS.

03:17:40.148 --> 03:17:40.915
WE ALL WANT TO KEEP OUR

03:17:40.982 --> 03:17:42.717
COMMUNITY SAFE AND DOESN'T MAKE

03:17:42.784 --> 03:17:44.819
SENSE TO AGAIN HAVE THIS ONLY

03:17:44.886 --> 03:17:46.054
CENTRALIZED IN.

03:17:46.120 --> 03:17:48.323
SACRAMENTO MAKES SENSE TO REALLY

03:17:48.389 --> 03:17:49.657
BE WORKING WITH LOCAL LAW

03:17:49.724 --> 03:17:51.025
ENFORCEMENT.

03:17:51.092 --> 03:17:52.927
TO GET THE BEST RESULTS SO THAT

03:17:52.994 --> 03:17:55.230
THE HOPE IS THAT AGAIN -- SPOKE

03:17:55.296 --> 03:17:56.397
WITH ATTORNEY GENERAL BUT REALLY

03:17:56.464 --> 03:17:57.365
WOULD HOPE.

03:17:57.432 --> 03:17:59.100
THAT AT SOME POINT HE KEY IN THE

03:17:59.167 --> 03:18:00.168
DEPARTMENT COOPER THE COME

03:18:00.235 --> 03:18:01.703
AROUND.

03:18:01.769 --> 03:18:05.373
TO REALLY WORKING WITH -- LOCALS

03:18:05.440 --> 03:18:05.974
IN A MORE EFFECTIVE WAY THANK

03:18:06.040 --> 03:18:09.510
YOU.

03:18:09.577 --> 03:18:10.678
DOCTOR WEBER.

03:18:10.745 --> 03:18:12.480
YES I THIS IS OBVIOUSLY AN ISSUE

03:18:12.547 --> 03:18:13.748
THAT COMES UP I HAS COME UP FOR

03:18:13.815 --> 03:18:15.583
SEVERAL YEARS IN A ROW AND SO --

03:18:15.650 --> 03:18:17.819
CLEARLY IT'S SOMETHING WE SHOULD

03:18:17.885 --> 03:18:19.787
BE CONCERNED ABOUT -- I THINK

03:18:19.854 --> 03:18:20.955
ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT I

03:18:21.022 --> 03:18:22.890
DISCOVERED IN MY CONVERSATION

03:18:22.957 --> 03:18:25.326
WITH THE WITH THE AG WAS THAT.

03:18:25.393 --> 03:18:27.028
YOU KNOW THIS IS THIS APPEARS TO

03:18:27.095 --> 03:18:28.930
BE A SITUATION THAT CONTINUES TO

03:18:28.997 --> 03:18:30.164
GROW AND IT CONTINUES TO GROW

03:18:30.231 --> 03:18:32.400
BECAUSE WE KEEP ADDING PEOPLE TO

03:18:32.467 --> 03:18:34.068
THE LIST SO I DOUBT IF WE'LL

03:18:34.135 --> 03:18:35.136
EVER GET TO ZERO LIST.

03:18:35.203 --> 03:18:36.904
OF IF YOU LOOK AT IT BECAUSE

03:18:36.971 --> 03:18:39.741
WHAT FOR EVER IN TERMS OF THE

03:18:39.807 --> 03:18:40.475
COURTS.

03:18:40.541 --> 03:18:41.242
ISSUING THESE KINDS OF THINGS

03:18:41.309 --> 03:18:43.144
AND SO AS A RESULT YOU KEEP

03:18:43.211 --> 03:18:45.446
MOVING YOU DON'T WANT TO GET A

03:18:45.513 --> 03:18:46.748
LARGER LIST WHICH IT BUT AS I

03:18:46.814 --> 03:18:47.982
SAID SO MANY COMES OFF ANOTHER

03:18:48.049 --> 03:18:50.318
GROUP GOES ON SO YOU'VE GOT THAT

03:18:50.385 --> 03:18:52.487
GOING -- ADDITIONALLY THERE HAS

03:18:52.553 --> 03:18:55.223
BEEN DISCUSSION AND I THINK --

03:18:55.290 --> 03:18:56.658
AS I LISTEN -- TO SOME OF YOUR

03:18:56.724 --> 03:18:59.360
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT ACTUALLY

03:18:59.427 --> 03:19:01.195
MAKING OR FIGURE OUT A BETTER

03:19:01.262 --> 03:19:03.665
WAY TO TO CAPTURE OR TO GET THE

03:19:03.731 --> 03:19:05.767
WEAPONS BEFORE WHILE YOU STILL

03:19:05.833 --> 03:19:06.701
HAVE PEOPLE THERE.

03:19:06.768 --> 03:19:08.202
WHAT YOU HAVE ACCESS TO THEM

03:19:08.269 --> 03:19:10.305
WITH IT'S A CONDITION OF RELEASE

03:19:10.371 --> 03:19:12.874
OR WHATEVER MAY BE -- THAT WE

03:19:12.940 --> 03:19:15.076
HAVE A TENDENCY TO OF MAKE IT

03:19:15.143 --> 03:19:17.211
THE JOB MUCH MORE DIFFICULT

03:19:17.278 --> 03:19:19.080
BECAUSE WITH ACTIVE AFTER

03:19:19.147 --> 03:19:19.647
THEY'RE GONE FROM THE CORNER

03:19:19.714 --> 03:19:20.014
WHERE THEY ARE.

03:19:20.081 --> 03:19:20.915
THEN WE GO LOOKING FOR THEM AND

03:19:20.982 --> 03:19:22.884
THEIR WEAPONS AND WHAT HAVE YOU

03:19:22.950 --> 03:19:23.518
AND IT MAKES IT FAR MORE

03:19:23.584 --> 03:19:24.786
COMPLICATED.

03:19:24.852 --> 03:19:25.953
THAN IT PROBABLY SHOULD BE SO

03:19:26.020 --> 03:19:26.988
YOU KNOW WE MAY WANT TO LOOK AT

03:19:27.055 --> 03:19:28.156
SOMETHING OF THOSE OF YOU WHO

03:19:28.222 --> 03:19:29.324
ARE REALLY INTERESTED IN AND WE

03:19:29.390 --> 03:19:30.391
WANT TO LOOK AT SOME SOME PIECE

03:19:30.458 --> 03:19:32.593
OF LEGISLATION.

03:19:32.660 --> 03:19:34.228
THAT WOULD REQUIRE THAT.

03:19:34.295 --> 03:19:35.363
CAN FALLING ON THAT LIST IF

03:19:35.430 --> 03:19:35.930
THERE'S SOME OTHER KIND OF

03:19:35.997 --> 03:19:37.065
STIPULATIONS IN TERMS OF

03:19:37.131 --> 03:19:38.533
COLLECTING THE WEAPONS BEFORE

03:19:38.599 --> 03:19:39.767
THE PEOPLE ARE LEFT TO TO

03:19:39.834 --> 03:19:40.535
LEAVING TO GO SOMEWHERE ELSE AND

03:19:40.601 --> 03:19:41.469
ALL OF A SUDDEN NOW YOU'VE GOT A

03:19:41.536 --> 03:19:42.203
MAJOR PROBLEM.

03:19:42.270 --> 03:19:43.938
IS YOU HAVE TO GO FIND WHEN YOU

03:19:44.005 --> 03:19:46.474
HAD ACCESS TO THEM AND THEY

03:19:46.541 --> 03:19:48.343
COULD HAVE HAD THE FOLKS BRING

03:19:48.409 --> 03:19:48.943
THEIR WEAPONS IN BEFORE THEY

03:19:49.010 --> 03:19:50.111
EVEN GAVE HIM THE ABILITY TO BE

03:19:50.178 --> 03:19:50.778
RELEASED.

03:19:50.845 --> 03:19:52.980
OF FROM WHATEVER CAPACITY OR

03:19:53.047 --> 03:19:53.815
WHEREVER THEY WERE IF THEY WERE

03:19:53.881 --> 03:19:54.916
SO THOSE KIND OF THINGS I THINK

03:19:54.982 --> 03:19:55.983
WE NEED TO LOOK AT CAREFULLY

03:19:56.050 --> 03:19:57.151
BECAUSE IT IS MAKES A A

03:19:57.218 --> 03:19:59.520
DIFFICULT JOB TO BE DONE -- BUT

03:19:59.587 --> 03:20:00.722
DOES IN OUR COMPASS MY

03:20:00.788 --> 03:20:02.390
CONVERSATION WITH -- THE AG

03:20:02.457 --> 03:20:03.758
CLEARLY THEY'RE MOVING FOR BUT

03:20:03.825 --> 03:20:04.692
IT'S IT'S A CONSTANT MOVING

03:20:04.759 --> 03:20:05.460
TARGET BECAUSE THEY KEEP ADDING

03:20:05.526 --> 03:20:06.327
TO THE LIST.

03:20:06.394 --> 03:20:08.963
AND THAT'S ALWAYS A CHALLENGE --

03:20:09.030 --> 03:20:10.164
AS YOU POINT OUT THIS IS A VERY

03:20:10.231 --> 03:20:11.299
DANGEROUS JOB.

03:20:11.366 --> 03:20:12.233
OF BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOU GO AND

03:20:12.300 --> 03:20:13.901
LOOK FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE GUNS

03:20:13.968 --> 03:20:15.303
AND WEAPONS AND SO YOU HAVE TO

03:20:15.370 --> 03:20:17.105
FIGURE HAS STRATEGICALLY YOU GET

03:20:17.171 --> 03:20:19.040
IT WITHOUT GETTING SOMEBODY HURT.

03:20:19.107 --> 03:20:20.341
AND THAT'S AND THAT'S A MAJOR

03:20:20.408 --> 03:20:21.642
ISSUE THAT SEVERE AND I THINK

03:20:21.709 --> 03:20:23.311
COORDINATION WITH THE COUNTIES

03:20:23.378 --> 03:20:25.880
WOULD HAVE TO EXIST BECAUSE OF

03:20:25.947 --> 03:20:26.848
ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT.

03:20:26.914 --> 03:20:28.850
JOB IF YOU ARE COUNTY YOU DON'T

03:20:28.916 --> 03:20:29.851
HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO GO INTO

03:20:29.917 --> 03:20:31.219
ANOTHER COUNTY SO THESE PEOPLE

03:20:31.285 --> 03:20:32.920
TAKE THIS STUFF AND RUN ACROSS

03:20:32.987 --> 03:20:33.855
COUNTY LINES.

03:20:33.921 --> 03:20:35.022
IS THE IGGY THAT CAN GO GET THEM

03:20:35.089 --> 03:20:37.291
L. BUT BUT YOU CAN'T GO GET THEM

03:20:37.358 --> 03:20:39.360
A FEW FROM A DIFFERENT COUNTY SO

03:20:39.427 --> 03:20:40.294
THAT'S ONE OF THINGS WERE

03:20:40.361 --> 03:20:41.429
COORDINATION BECOMES A VERY

03:20:41.496 --> 03:20:42.663
IMPORTANT THAT.

03:20:42.730 --> 03:20:43.598
YOU KNOW BECAUSE THEN THE COUNTY

03:20:43.664 --> 03:20:45.600
IS LIMITED IN ITS WHAT YOU CAN

03:20:45.666 --> 03:20:46.834
COLLECTED.

03:20:46.901 --> 03:20:48.002
BUT THE WORKING WITH DEAL JAY

03:20:48.069 --> 03:20:49.103
THEY CAN THEN OBVIOUSLY STILL

03:20:49.170 --> 03:20:58.045
MAKE THAT HAPPEN SO CLEARLY

03:20:58.112 --> 03:21:00.915
THERE'S A LOT OF MEAT.

03:21:00.982 --> 03:21:01.549
FOUR FOUR OF CORD NATION OF THIS

03:21:01.616 --> 03:21:02.083
BUT IT'S A VERY MUCH MORE

03:21:02.150 --> 03:21:03.484
COMPLICATED WE ALSO LOOKED AT

03:21:03.551 --> 03:21:04.886
THE LIST AND TERMS OF A TRYING

03:21:04.952 --> 03:21:06.521
TO UNDERSTAND HOW PEOPLE ON THE

03:21:06.587 --> 03:21:07.155
LIST AND HOW LONG THE STATE ON

03:21:07.221 --> 03:21:07.422
HIS LIST.

03:21:07.488 --> 03:21:08.556
AND THEN SOME OF THEM ARE STILL

03:21:08.623 --> 03:21:09.757
ON THE LIST IN AN OPENING STATUS

03:21:09.824 --> 03:21:11.058
OR WHATEVER SIMPLY BECAUSE

03:21:11.125 --> 03:21:12.260
THEY'VE COLLECTED OF MOST OF THE

03:21:12.326 --> 03:21:13.327
GUNS WE COULDN'T FIND THE OTHER

03:21:13.394 --> 03:21:14.729
ONE IT'S SOMEBODY LOST SOMEWHERE

03:21:14.796 --> 03:21:16.731
WHERE BUT WAS AND SO THE PROCESS.

03:21:16.798 --> 03:21:18.766
FIVE AND SIX GUNS AND YOU CLICK

03:21:18.833 --> 03:21:20.234
FIVE OF THEM BOB THAT ONE IS

03:21:20.301 --> 03:21:21.402
THEIR KEEPS YOU ON THE LIST.

03:21:21.469 --> 03:21:22.136
AND AND SO THAT'S WHAT SOME OF

03:21:22.203 --> 03:21:23.604
THESE CASES ARE PENDING BECAUSE

03:21:23.671 --> 03:21:24.939
THE THE THE GUN IS.

03:21:25.006 --> 03:21:25.940
BEEN DESTROYED SOMETHING'S

03:21:26.007 --> 03:21:27.008
HAPPENED PERSONS GUNS BY

03:21:27.074 --> 03:21:27.975
STICKING ACOSTA A LINE WHATEVER

03:21:28.042 --> 03:21:29.877
MAYBE AND SO YOU CAN'T FIND IT

03:21:29.944 --> 03:21:31.479
EVEN THOUGH YOU PUT ENERGY AND

03:21:31.546 --> 03:21:32.146
TIME IN TRYING TO COLLECTED WITH

03:21:32.213 --> 03:21:32.980
THIS PERSON.

03:21:33.047 --> 03:21:33.948
THE ONLY FILE FOUND FIVE OF THE

03:21:34.015 --> 03:21:35.216
GUNS AND THEY WERE REALLY

03:21:35.283 --> 03:21:36.317
ANOTHER ONE SOMEWHERE ELSE SOLD

03:21:36.384 --> 03:21:37.118
IT'S IT'S A REALLY INTERESTING

03:21:37.185 --> 03:21:37.718
WE START LOOKING AT THE LIST

03:21:37.785 --> 03:21:38.286
THAT MAKES IT LOOK LIKE THEY

03:21:38.352 --> 03:21:39.420
HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING BUT

03:21:39.487 --> 03:21:41.055
THERE'S A LOT OF MOVEMENT THAT'S

03:21:41.122 --> 03:21:42.890
GOING ON WITHTHIS COLLECTION.

03:21:42.957 --> 03:21:44.826
AND BUT I THINK AT THE SAME TIME

03:21:44.892 --> 03:21:45.660
THEIR LOT THERE'S ALSO A LOT OF

03:21:45.726 --> 03:21:47.628
ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT IN

03:21:47.695 --> 03:21:48.796
COORDINATION WITH IT AND SO I I

03:21:48.863 --> 03:21:50.531
LOOK AT THAT.

03:21:50.598 --> 03:21:52.967
CONCERNING THE ISSUE OF SALARIES

03:21:53.034 --> 03:21:54.435
AS AN ONGOING CHALLENGE IN THE

03:21:54.502 --> 03:21:55.970
IN THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

03:21:56.037 --> 03:21:57.638
BECAUSE IT'S HARD TO GET OF

03:21:57.705 --> 03:21:59.240
FOLKS PARTICULARLY EVEN EVEN

03:21:59.307 --> 03:22:01.309
JUST ON THE OTHER SIDE IN TERMS

03:22:01.375 --> 03:22:03.211
OF THOSE WHO OF THE LEGAL SIDE

03:22:03.277 --> 03:22:04.111
IT'S HARD TO GET.

03:22:04.178 --> 03:22:06.280
OTHER PEOPLE TO COME AND TO STAY

03:22:06.347 --> 03:22:08.316
BECAUSE WE LIMITED IN OUR PAY

03:22:08.382 --> 03:22:10.751
SCALE IN AND WHAT WE HAVE AND

03:22:10.818 --> 03:22:12.954
OBVIOUSLY IT'S MUCH OF THIS IF

03:22:13.020 --> 03:22:14.288
YOU GET A LOT MORE LEAVE IN YOUR

03:22:14.355 --> 03:22:15.923
WITH SOME LAW FIRM OR IF YOU GO

03:22:15.990 --> 03:22:16.157
BECOME.

03:22:16.224 --> 03:22:17.825
SOMEONE A DISTRICT ATTORNEY

03:22:17.892 --> 03:22:18.993
WHATEVER MAY BE YOU THEN END UP

03:22:19.060 --> 03:22:20.361
MAKING MORE MONEY SO IT'S THAT

03:22:20.428 --> 03:22:22.663
HE'S HAVING A DIFFICULT TIME.

03:22:22.730 --> 03:22:23.764
KEEPING THE STAFF THAT HE HAS

03:22:23.831 --> 03:22:26.300
ATTRACTED GOOD STAFF AND KEEPING

03:22:26.367 --> 03:22:27.768
IT BECAUSE OF WHAT OUR PAY SCALE

03:22:27.835 --> 03:22:29.403
LOOKS LIKE AS THE STATE PAYS

03:22:29.470 --> 03:22:31.272
GILBERT'S ANYTHING ELSE WE FIND

03:22:31.339 --> 03:22:32.306
THAT TO BE TRUE WITH THIS IN IT

03:22:32.373 --> 03:22:32.974
OR WHATEVER IT IS.

03:22:33.040 --> 03:22:34.242
THAT IT'S HARD TO TRACK PEOPLE

03:22:34.308 --> 03:22:35.543
TO WORK FOR THE STATE UNLESS YOU

03:22:35.610 --> 03:22:36.944
JUST WANT TO WORK FOR THE STATE

03:22:37.011 --> 03:22:38.713
BECAUSE THEY CAN GET THE SKILLS

03:22:38.779 --> 03:22:40.014
THE TRAINING HERE AND THEN GO

03:22:40.081 --> 03:22:41.449
OFF AND MAKE. TWO TO THREE TIMES

03:22:41.516 --> 03:22:43.751
MORE MONEY DOING SOMETHING ELSE

03:22:43.818 --> 03:22:45.820
AND OFF AND SOLD THE FLEXIBILITY

03:22:45.887 --> 03:22:48.155
TO DO THAT -- IT LOOKS LIKE IT

03:22:48.222 --> 03:22:57.832
HAVE THAT BUT THEY REALLY DON'T

03:22:57.899 --> 03:22:58.432
IN TERMS OF THE PAY SCALE THAT

03:22:58.499 --> 03:23:00.601
WE HAVE NOT ONLY THAT THE BUDGET

03:23:00.668 --> 03:23:01.068
THAT WE GIVE TO THEM.

03:23:01.135 --> 03:23:01.936
IT ALSO PUTS LIMITATIONS ON THEM

03:23:02.003 --> 03:23:03.971
SO THEY DON'T HAVE THE BUDGET IN

03:23:04.038 --> 03:23:05.540
AND WHAT IS WHAT TO COME FROM

03:23:05.606 --> 03:23:06.274
COME FROM US SO IF WE DON'T

03:23:06.340 --> 03:23:07.775
START INCREASING SALARIES WE

03:23:07.842 --> 03:23:08.943
HAVE STUDIED CREASING BUDGETS.

03:23:09.010 --> 03:23:09.710
AND SO.

03:23:09.777 --> 03:23:10.745
YOU KNOW SO IT'S IT'S IT'S IT'S

03:23:10.811 --> 03:23:11.846
IT'S IT'S A DIFFICULT TASK TO TO

03:23:11.913 --> 03:23:13.748
MANAGE AND SO IT'S NOT JUST

03:23:13.814 --> 03:23:14.582
ABOUT EIGHT TO ARE GETTING

BE SOME CHANGES THAT ARE

03:29:19.446 --> 03:29:20.514
APPROPRIATE TO BETTER ALIGN

PROPOSAL OF THE SENATE REJECTED

03:31:29.943 --> 03:31:31.011
IT.

03:31:31.078 --> 03:31:32.246
THIS IS REALLY AN ISSUE OF

03:31:32.312 --> 03:31:33.680
LEGISLATIVE PRIORITY WE WOULD

03:31:33.747 --> 03:31:35.349
NOTE THAT TO THE EXTENT THAT

03:31:35.416 --> 03:31:37.384
ADDITIONAL RESOURCES -- WERE

03:31:37.451 --> 03:31:38.652
PROVIDED OUR UNDERSTANDING IS

03:31:38.719 --> 03:31:40.254
THAT DOJ WOULD USE THAT TO

03:31:40.320 --> 03:31:41.522
SUPPLEMENT THE WORK THAT LOCAL

03:31:41.588 --> 03:31:43.023
DJS WERE IT WOULD BE DOING IN

03:31:43.090 --> 03:31:45.793
THIS AREA.

03:31:45.859 --> 03:31:47.694
FINANCE WE SUPPORT THE ASSEMBLY

03:31:47.761 --> 03:31:52.433
ACTION ON THE SIDE OF A I HAVE A

03:31:52.499 --> 03:31:59.640
QUESTION AS WE LOOKED AT THE WAY

03:31:59.706 --> 03:32:03.744
OUT THE ENABLING LEGISLATION AB.

03:32:03.811 --> 03:32:04.244
NINETEEN NINETEEN ON MY

03:32:04.311 --> 03:32:04.945
INTERPRETATION IS MY

03:32:05.012 --> 03:32:06.647
UNDERSTANDING THAT DOJ WAS NOT

03:32:06.713 --> 03:32:08.282
TASK WITH THE ENFORCEMENT

03:32:08.348 --> 03:32:10.117
RESPONSIBILITIES OF THIS BILL.

03:32:10.184 --> 03:32:11.251
THE BILL CREATES MISDEMEANORS

03:32:11.318 --> 03:32:12.853
HER FORCIBLE BY LOCAL LAW

03:32:12.920 --> 03:32:15.656
ENFORCEMENT -- AND SO ARE YOU

03:32:15.722 --> 03:32:17.391
ANTICIPATING THAT THERE WOULD BE

03:32:17.458 --> 03:32:19.560
A GOOD NUMBER OF EXTRAORDINARY

03:32:19.626 --> 03:32:21.562
CIRCUMSTANCES WERE DEALS YOU

03:32:21.628 --> 03:32:24.164
WOULD EVEN HAVE TO BE INVOLVED.

03:32:24.231 --> 03:32:24.798
THE ALL SPEAK BRIEFLY AND THEN

03:32:24.865 --> 03:32:25.899
TURN IT OVER TO A COLLEAGUES TO

03:32:25.966 --> 03:32:26.900
GENERAL YOU -- AS YOU NOTED

03:32:26.967 --> 03:32:27.901
MADAM CHAIR LOCAL LAW

03:32:27.968 --> 03:32:29.703
ENFORCEMENT WILL PLAY A PRIMARY

03:32:29.770 --> 03:32:30.737
ROLE IN ADDRESSING THESE TYPES

03:32:30.804 --> 03:32:31.939
OF SITUATIONS.

03:32:32.005 --> 03:32:33.073
BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THE

03:32:33.140 --> 03:32:34.475
ADMINISTRATION HAS NOTICED WITH

03:32:34.541 --> 03:32:36.110
THESE EMERGENCY CASES THAT THEY

03:32:36.176 --> 03:32:37.277
DON'T NECESSARILY.

03:32:37.344 --> 03:32:38.512
THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY CONFINED

03:32:38.579 --> 03:32:39.813
TO JURISDICTIONAL LINES SO OFTEN

03:32:39.880 --> 03:32:41.548
THERE ACROSS COUNTIES ARE OTHER

03:32:41.615 --> 03:32:43.117
JURISDICTIONS SAID THE DOJ CAN

03:32:43.183 --> 03:32:44.751
PLAY A VERY HELPFUL COORDINATING

03:32:44.818 --> 03:32:46.687
ROLE ESPECIALLY IN A SITUATION

03:32:46.753 --> 03:32:47.988
OF STRESS WHEN WE ARE DEALING

03:32:48.055 --> 03:32:48.822
WITH THIS.

03:32:48.889 --> 03:32:49.523
AT THE SAME TIME THAT WE'RE

03:32:49.590 --> 03:32:51.625
TRYING TO ADDRESS THE UNDERLYING

03:32:51.692 --> 03:32:52.559
EMERGENCY.

03:32:52.626 --> 03:32:53.660
AND SO FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE TO

03:32:53.727 --> 03:32:57.297
POSITIONS WOULD BE ADEQUATE

03:32:57.364 --> 03:33:00.200
STATE WHY. FOR THIS TYPE OF

03:33:00.267 --> 03:33:00.834
COORDINATING BUT IF YOU WANT TO

03:33:00.901 --> 03:33:01.268
ADD.

03:33:01.335 --> 03:33:02.102
I THINK THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT I

03:33:02.169 --> 03:33:02.736
THINK WHEN WE ARE REVIEWING THE

03:33:02.803 --> 03:33:04.037
PROPOSAL I'M IT DOES CONSIDER

03:33:04.104 --> 03:33:06.140
CONTINUED COOPERATION WITH THE

03:33:06.206 --> 03:33:07.508
LOCALS AND THEY WOULD STILL BE

03:33:07.574 --> 03:33:09.143
ENFORCING THESE LAWS AS WELL BUT

03:33:09.209 --> 03:33:10.911
IT IS MORE OF A A COORDINATION

03:33:10.978 --> 03:33:13.947
EFFORT ON BEHALF OF DOJ AND YOU

03:33:14.014 --> 03:33:15.149
KNOW MAKING SURE THAT.

03:33:15.215 --> 03:33:17.584
THEY'RE ABLE TO HANDLE ANY CROSS

03:33:17.651 --> 03:33:19.553
IT -- JURISDICTIONAL ISSUES.

03:33:19.620 --> 03:33:20.287

ANGLE DATA ON HATE CRIMES.

03:34:30.924 --> 03:34:33.527
BUT I I'M NOT SURE IF THAT'S

03:34:33.594 --> 03:34:34.561
PREVALENT EVERY OTHER OF THE

03:34:34.628 --> 03:34:36.697
FIFTY SEVEN COUNTIES.

03:34:36.763 --> 03:34:38.065

THIS JUST.

03:34:43.103 --> 03:34:44.871

WHAT WILL FINANCE CAN RESPOND

BUT BUT IT'S?

03:34:47.874 --> 03:34:50.043
MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THAT THIS

03:34:50.110 --> 03:34:53.480
PARTICULAR ALLOCATION -- IS

03:34:53.547 --> 03:34:57.417
REALLY DEALING WITH -- DATA BASE

03:34:57.484 --> 03:34:59.920

MANAGEMENT AN INJURY.

03:35:01.955 --> 03:35:03.156
AND SO I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S

03:35:03.223 --> 03:35:04.558
THE KIND OF WORK ON THE TO THAT

03:35:04.625 --> 03:35:06.126
AT THE LOCAL LEVEL.

03:35:06.193 --> 03:35:09.763
OR NOT IT IS AN ORANGE AND IT'S

03:35:09.830 --> 03:35:11.498
WHY I JUST GOT IT.

03:35:11.565 --> 03:35:13.500

I'M NOT SURE I FULLY -- HAVE THE

03:35:19.139 --> 03:35:19.973
BACKGROUND ON WHAT YOU THE

03:35:20.040 --> 03:35:21.742
PROGRAM IS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

03:35:21.808 --> 03:35:25.245
BUT THESE POSITIONS AT DOJ ARE

03:35:25.312 --> 03:35:27.648
TO HELP WITH -- THE LOCALS AND

03:35:27.714 --> 03:35:29.283
IN REPORTING HATE CRIMES IN THE

03:35:29.349 --> 03:35:31.685
INFORMATION TO DOJ AS WELL AS

03:35:31.752 --> 03:35:33.654
PROVIDING TRAINING TO LOCAL

03:35:33.720 --> 03:35:36.757
AGENCIES ON HOW TO IDENTIFY IT

03:35:36.823 --> 03:35:39.493
AND HOW TO RECORD IT -- WE WANT

03:35:39.559 --> 03:35:40.294
TO MAKE SURE THEY WERE GETTING

03:35:40.360 --> 03:35:41.795
THIS ACCURATE INFORMATION I

03:35:41.862 --> 03:35:43.997
THINK IS WHAT THE AUDITOR FOUND

03:35:44.064 --> 03:35:45.732
IN THEIR REPORT SO.

03:35:45.799 --> 03:35:49.303
THESE POSITIONS WILL HELP DOJ --

03:35:49.369 --> 03:35:51.471
WITHOUT CLICK THE INFORMATION.

03:35:51.538 --> 03:35:52.472
AND IF I MAY I MAY PROVIDE A

03:35:52.539 --> 03:35:53.674
LITTLE BIT MORE CONTEXT TO SO

03:35:53.740 --> 03:35:55.175
SPECIFICALLY SOME OF THE

03:35:55.242 --> 03:35:56.777
FINDINGS THAT WERE MADE -- THAT

03:35:56.843 --> 03:35:58.111
THIS WOULD ADDRESS IS THAT ONE

03:35:58.178 --> 03:35:59.413
OF THE FINDINGS WAS THAT SOMEONE

03:35:59.479 --> 03:36:01.081
FORSMAN AGENCIES WERE NOT

03:36:01.148 --> 03:36:02.816
ACCURATELY IDENTIFYING HATE

03:36:02.883 --> 03:36:04.217
CRIMES AND THEN DETERMINING

03:36:04.284 --> 03:36:05.585
WHETHER OR NOT TO ENTER THEM

03:36:05.652 --> 03:36:07.020
INTO THE SYSTEM.

03:36:07.087 --> 03:36:08.388
AND THAT THEY ALSO KIND OF LACKS

03:36:08.455 --> 03:36:10.590
THE APPROPRIATE TOOLS -- EXCITER

03:36:10.657 --> 03:36:12.225
AT ANOTHER FINDING THAT THEY

03:36:12.292 --> 03:36:13.894
FOUND WAS THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT

03:36:13.960 --> 03:36:15.295
AGENCIES DIDN'T HAVE ADEQUATE

03:36:15.362 --> 03:36:17.164
POLICIES IN THIS AREA AND THAT

03:36:17.230 --> 03:36:18.799
DOJ KIND OF LACKED OVERSIGHT AND

03:36:18.865 --> 03:36:20.233
SO OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THIS IS

03:36:20.300 --> 03:36:22.202
THAT THIS BUDGET PROPOSAL IS TO

03:36:22.269 --> 03:36:23.670
ADDRESS -- AT LEAST TO THOSE TWO

03:36:23.737 --> 03:36:27.808
KEY FINDINGS ALONG WITH OTHERS.

03:36:27.874 --> 03:36:28.575
THANK YOU.

03:36:28.642 --> 03:36:30.010
BECAUSE THE HUMAN RELATIONS

03:36:30.077 --> 03:36:31.778
COMMISSION IS NOT A LAW

03:36:31.845 --> 03:36:34.715
ENFORCEMENT.

03:36:34.781 --> 03:36:35.349
AND SO.

03:36:35.415 --> 03:36:37.050
IT YEAH IF IF OUR PUBLIC SAFETY

03:36:37.117 --> 03:36:38.618
OFFICIALS AREN'T DOCUMENTING

03:36:38.685 --> 03:36:40.687

FOLLOWED BY THAT THE WEBER WITH

03:36:45.826 --> 03:36:47.761
SKINNER.

03:36:47.828 --> 03:36:49.096
YES THANK YOU -- OUR

03:36:49.162 --> 03:36:50.797

YOU KNOW WE ARE NOT GETTING THE

03:37:08.315 --> 03:37:11.118

03:37:11.184 --> 03:37:12.119
ENTITIES.

03:37:12.185 --> 03:37:14.054
BUT IS I THINK WE KNOWN WE'VE

03:37:14.121 --> 03:37:15.455

THERE ARE A LOT OF AGENCIES SO

03:37:23.730 --> 03:37:26.032
WHAT WAS FRUSTRATING IN THE

03:38:01.835 --> 03:38:04.538
HOW OFFERING FIVE WORK FUNDING

THIS ISSUE BECAUSE WE GET

03:38:26.993 --> 03:38:29.896

BECAUSE WE'VE HAD SITUATIONS

03:38:40.507 --> 03:38:42.075
WHERE WE'VE HAD?

03:38:42.142 --> 03:38:43.343
A GROUP OF STUDENTS WHO WOULD

03:38:43.410 --> 03:38:44.244
YOUNG PEOPLE WHO WOULD HAVE BEEN

03:38:44.311 --> 03:38:45.946
CONSIDERED A GANG IF THEY HAD

03:38:46.012 --> 03:38:47.514
BEEN A DIFFERENT RACE.

03:38:47.581 --> 03:38:48.815
ACTUALLY ATTACK AND KILLED A

03:38:48.882 --> 03:38:50.984

AND THEY DID ONE IS LISTED AS A

03:38:52.819 --> 03:38:54.621
HATE CRIME THEY DID IT BECAUSE

03:38:54.688 --> 03:38:57.190

03:39:02.629 --> 03:39:03.463
FOLLOWED HIM HOME AND CHILDREN

03:39:03.530 --> 03:39:05.365
OKAY -- THAT WAS NEVER LISTED AS

03:39:05.432 --> 03:39:09.202
A HATE CRIME AND NOR WOULD THEY

03:39:09.269 --> 03:39:10.704
EVER SEEN AS A GANG.

03:39:10.770 --> 03:39:13.006
SO I'VE ASKED THEM OFTEN DO YOU

03:39:13.073 --> 03:39:14.307
I KNOW YOU CHRONICLE LIST AND

KIDS WHO ARE CALLED GANG MEMBERS

03:39:17.677 --> 03:39:18.578
OKAY AND AND THAT'S A BIG THING

03:39:18.645 --> 03:39:19.713
STATEWIDE.

03:39:19.779 --> 03:39:21.081
DO YOU DO THE SAME THING FOR

03:39:21.147 --> 03:39:22.315
WHITE KIDS WHO MAY BE A PART OF

03:39:22.382 --> 03:39:24.718

THEIR RACE OR WHATEVER AND THEY

03:39:33.026 --> 03:39:34.895
DON'T -- SO THERE'S A PROBLEM IN

03:39:34.961 --> 03:39:36.396
GETTING THAT DATA.

03:39:36.463 --> 03:39:38.131
BECAUSE THE DATA WITHIN INFORM

03:39:38.198 --> 03:39:39.900
US OF THE SIZE OF THE PROBLEM

03:39:39.966 --> 03:39:41.768
WHERE IT'S LOCATED -- IT GOES

03:39:41.835 --> 03:39:44.137
ACROSS COUNTY LINES AND DID

03:39:44.204 --> 03:39:46.072

THEY DON'T REALLY DO A LOT OF

03:39:53.179 --> 03:39:53.813
THAT.

03:39:53.880 --> 03:39:55.348
AND SO -- YOU KNOW I LOOK AT

03:39:55.415 --> 03:39:56.316
THIS AND SAID OKAY THIS IS

03:39:56.383 --> 03:39:57.918
SOMETHING THAT LIKE MOST

03:39:57.984 --> 03:39:59.219
PROBLEMS YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO

03:39:59.286 --> 03:39:59.886
FIGHT IT YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO

03:39:59.953 --> 03:40:01.988
DEAL WITH THAT UNLESS YOU KNOW

03:40:02.055 --> 03:40:03.423
THE SIZE OF IT.

03:40:03.490 --> 03:40:03.957
YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE IT'S

03:40:04.024 --> 03:40:04.991
LOCATED IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO

03:40:05.058 --> 03:40:06.092
TALK ABOUT INTERVENTION AND

03:40:06.159 --> 03:40:07.394
THINGS THAT SCHOOLS IF YOU DON'T

03:40:07.460 --> 03:40:08.695
EVER SEE IT AS A PROBLEM.

03:40:08.762 --> 03:40:10.664
AND SOME COUNTIES DON'T EVER SEE

03:40:10.730 --> 03:40:11.765
IT AS A PROBLEM.

03:40:11.831 --> 03:40:13.400
YOU KNOW BECAUSE OF THE MAKE UP

03:40:13.466 --> 03:40:15.068
OF THE COUNTY OR WHATEVER IT MAY

03:40:15.135 --> 03:40:16.670
BE AN ACTIVITIES A CAR.

03:40:16.736 --> 03:40:18.405
AND THEY DON'T THINK THIS IS

03:40:18.471 --> 03:40:20.240
LIKE HORSE OF KIDS PLAN AROUND

03:40:20.307 --> 03:40:22.208
WHATEVER BABY AND YET IT REALLY

03:40:22.275 --> 03:40:23.843

SITUATION OR WHATEVER IT MAY BE

03:40:30.917 --> 03:40:32.652
BUT WE NEED TO GET TO THE POINT

03:40:32.719 --> 03:40:33.887
WE START LOOKING AT THESE THINGS.

03:40:33.954 --> 03:40:36.122
BECAUSE THEY ARE SIGNIFICANT AND

03:40:36.189 --> 03:40:38.024
WE'RE FINDING THAT -- THEY HAVE

03:40:38.091 --> 03:40:39.859
SOMEHOW INFILTRATED MANY OF OUR

03:40:39.926 --> 03:40:42.963

FIFTEEN SENATOR NIELSEN.

03:43:27.494 --> 03:43:30.196
MADAM CHAIR I THIS IS A VERY

03:43:30.263 --> 03:43:31.331
SIGNIFICANT.

03:43:31.397 --> 03:43:34.467
SUBSTANTIAL AND FAR REACHING

03:43:34.534 --> 03:43:34.768
[inaudible]

03:43:34.834 --> 03:43:36.102
APPROACH.

03:43:36.169 --> 03:43:38.772
A REDIRECTION OF THE ENTIRE.

03:43:38.838 --> 03:43:40.273
HISTORY OF JUVENILE JUSTICE IN

03:43:40.340 --> 03:43:42.108
CALIFORNIA.

03:43:42.175 --> 03:43:43.710
AND I'M NOT SAYING THAT THERE'S

03:43:43.777 --> 03:43:46.679
NOT MERIT IN THIS CHANGE.

03:43:46.746 --> 03:43:49.315
BUT THERE ARE SO MANY LOOSE ENDS.

03:43:49.382 --> 03:43:51.084
I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT WHAT WE

03:43:51.151 --> 03:43:54.087
HAVE BEFORE US TODAY IS VERY

03:43:54.154 --> 03:43:55.822
THOROUGHLY THOUGHT OUT.

03:43:55.889 --> 03:43:57.524
AND PRETTY PLAN.

03:43:57.590 --> 03:43:59.559
AS TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS

03:43:59.626 --> 03:44:03.062
TREMENDOUS CHANGE.

03:44:03.129 --> 03:44:05.832
AND AND THE STAKES ARE HIGH HERE.

03:44:05.899 --> 03:44:07.300
IT WOULD SEEM TO ME THAT THIS

03:44:07.367 --> 03:44:09.335
WOULD CERTAINLY NOT BE A GOOD

03:44:09.402 --> 03:44:11.871
CANDIDATE FOR TRAILER BILL.

03:44:11.938 --> 03:44:14.207
AND AND I AND I ARGUE THAT

03:44:14.274 --> 03:44:15.809
BULLSHIT PERSONALLY THAT THE

03:44:15.875 --> 03:44:18.745
PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA BE LET DOWN.

03:44:18.812 --> 03:44:20.113
IS THIS JUST STEPS ON WAY.

03:44:20.180 --> 03:44:21.314
THROUGH AS A TRAILER BILL IT IS

03:44:21.381 --> 03:44:24.250
A MAJOR CHANGE.

03:44:24.317 --> 03:44:24.984
IT CAN HAVE HOPE IT CAN A

03:44:25.051 --> 03:44:27.353
PROMISE.

03:44:27.420 --> 03:44:29.055
BUT DON'T INFO OVER INFLATE THE

03:44:29.122 --> 03:44:30.657
PROMISE.

COUPLE OF YEARS.

03:45:25.612 --> 03:45:27.347
WHILE NONE OF THE BILL'S

03:46:00.914 --> 03:46:03.316
DEVELOPMENT THAT WITH THE RIGHT

03:46:03.383 --> 03:46:05.118
TYPES OF INTERVENTIONS.

03:46:05.184 --> 03:46:06.619
WE COULD CONCEIVABLY HAVE A

03:46:06.686 --> 03:46:09.155
CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE WINTER REALLY

03:46:09.222 --> 03:46:10.924
DO ASSIST TURNING THESE PEOPLE'S

NAME CHANGE BUT WE FELT THAT.

03:46:32.779 --> 03:46:35.248
WE WE WANTED TO ENSURE AND NOT

03:46:35.315 --> 03:46:37.317
TO SAY THAT THE ADMINISTRATION'S

03:46:37.383 --> 03:46:38.718
INTENT IS ONLY COSMETIC.

03:46:38.785 --> 03:46:40.887
BUT WE WANTED TO ENSURE THAT

03:46:40.954 --> 03:46:42.922
THERE WERE RESOURCES TO HELP

03:46:42.989 --> 03:46:44.857
WITH THAT CULTURE CHANGE WHICH

03:46:44.924 --> 03:46:47.260
IS WHY WE INCLUDED IN OUR

03:46:47.327 --> 03:46:52.031
PACKAGE SOME FUNDING. TO BEGIN --

03:46:52.098 --> 03:46:53.399
TO DO THIS THERAPEUTIC

COMMUNITIES MODEL WHICH HAS BEEN --

03:46:55.702 --> 03:46:58.404
IS BEING APPLIED IN A NUMBER OF

OUR STATE PRISONS WITH A VARIETY

03:47:00.306 --> 03:47:01.808
OF AGES BUT FOR WHICH THE

03:47:01.874 --> 03:47:03.810
RESEARCH SHOWS HAS MORE PROMISE

03:47:03.876 --> 03:47:08.014
EVEN. FOR YOUNG PEOPLE SO THAT

03:47:08.081 --> 03:47:10.083
WAS ONE OF OUR THAT WAS OUR

03:47:10.149 --> 03:47:12.385
INTENT IN ADDING THAT COMPONENT.

03:47:12.452 --> 03:47:15.355

FEW YEARS ON THE WHOLE ISSUE OF

03:48:14.147 --> 03:48:15.982
THE JUNE JUSTICE SYSTEM AND HOW

LIVES AND AND MAKE IT NOT JUST A

03:48:21.020 --> 03:48:24.424
PIPELINE TO A BIGGER PRISON

03:48:24.490 --> 03:48:25.725
LATER ON WE WERE.

03:48:25.792 --> 03:48:27.060
COULDN'T WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE

THIS PROPOSAL WOULD BE -- TAKEN

03:48:29.295 --> 03:48:31.297
SERIOUSLY BY OUR COMMITTEE AS

03:48:31.364 --> 03:48:32.632
WELL AS EVERYONE ELSE WE

03:48:32.698 --> 03:48:34.333
REQUESTED QUITE OFTEN A LOT OF

03:48:34.400 --> 03:48:36.602
INFORMATION AND WE DIDN'T GET

03:48:36.669 --> 03:48:38.938
NECESSARY LOT OF DETAILS FROM.

03:48:39.005 --> 03:48:41.507
OF FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF

03:48:41.574 --> 03:48:42.708
FINANCE AND OTHERS WHO MAKING

03:48:42.775 --> 03:48:44.043
THE PROPOSAL SO THE PROPOSAL

03:48:44.110 --> 03:48:45.411
DIDN'T COME TO US WITH A LOT OF

03:48:45.478 --> 03:48:46.979
DETAILS A LOT OF INFORMATION.

03:48:47.046 --> 03:48:48.381
OF THAT WAS THERE THAT WAS THAT

03:48:48.448 --> 03:48:49.782
WAS PROBLEMATIC FOR ME BECAUSE

03:48:49.849 --> 03:48:51.084
I'M A DETAIL PERSON ESPECIALLY

03:48:51.150 --> 03:48:52.285
WHEN YOU START TALKING WITH

03:48:52.351 --> 03:48:54.020
CHANGING PROGRAMS AND ADJUSTING

03:48:54.087 --> 03:48:55.988
BECAUSEI KNOW IT'S ONE THING TO

03:48:56.055 --> 03:48:56.989
CHANGE I'M ANOTHER THING TO

03:48:57.056 --> 03:48:57.890
CHANGE IN A WAY THAT MAKES A

03:48:57.957 --> 03:48:58.891
DIFFERENCE.

03:48:58.958 --> 03:49:00.726
AND OUR THINKING WAS -- WITH

03:49:00.793 --> 03:49:02.195
THIS WITH REGARD TO THIS AS THE

03:49:02.261 --> 03:49:03.696
AS WE HAD ALL OF THE FOLKS

03:49:03.763 --> 03:49:05.264
TALKING AND COME IN MANY OF THE

03:49:05.331 --> 03:49:06.566
ADVOCATES WERE VERY.

03:49:06.632 --> 03:49:08.534
MUCH IN FAVOR THOSE WHO WORK

03:49:08.601 --> 03:49:10.570
WITH YOUNG PEOPLE IN BJJ -- WERE

03:49:10.636 --> 03:49:12.605
VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE CHANGE

03:49:12.672 --> 03:49:13.906
THAT THEY RECOGNIZE THAT THEY

03:49:13.973 --> 03:49:14.707
WOULD THAT WE NEED TO SOMETHING

03:49:14.774 --> 03:49:16.175
DIFFERENT WE'VE BEEN DOING SOME

03:49:16.242 --> 03:49:17.210
DIFFERENT THINGS AND REDUCING

03:49:17.276 --> 03:49:18.845
THE POPULATION BUT WE REALLY

03:49:18.911 --> 03:49:21.147
NEED TO HAVE A SYSTEM THAT WAS

03:49:21.214 --> 03:49:22.081
DIFFERENT TO DEAL WITH YOUNG

03:49:22.148 --> 03:49:24.484
PEOPLE -- AND FOR THAT REASON --

03:49:24.550 --> 03:49:25.952
WE WANTED MORE DETAILS ABOUT

03:49:26.018 --> 03:49:27.920
WHAT IS TO BE DONE WE ALSO

03:49:27.987 --> 03:49:29.922
DIDN'T WANT TO NOT THAT THIS WAS

03:49:29.989 --> 03:49:31.491
WHAT THE THE PROPOSAL WAS BUT WE

03:49:31.557 --> 03:49:32.992
DIDN'T WANT TO JUST TAKE IT.

03:49:33.059 --> 03:49:34.360
FROM.

03:49:34.427 --> 03:49:37.163
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO TO THE

03:49:37.230 --> 03:49:37.897
OTHER DEPARTMENT AND THAT WOULD

03:49:37.964 --> 03:49:38.631
BE IT BECAUSE WE DIDN'T THINK

03:49:38.698 --> 03:49:40.500
JUST MOVING A PROGRAM FROM ONE

03:49:40.566 --> 03:49:42.435
HOUSE TO THE NEXT HOUSE WOULD

03:49:42.502 --> 03:49:44.237
MAKE EIGHTY SIX ANY SUBSTANTIVE

03:49:44.303 --> 03:49:45.037
DIFFERENCE IN CHANGE.

03:49:45.104 --> 03:49:46.606
AND I WAS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY

03:49:46.672 --> 03:49:48.674
WE WANTED TO INCORPORATE OR HAVE

03:49:48.741 --> 03:49:50.076
AN ADVISORY COMMITTEE BECAUSE WE

03:49:50.143 --> 03:49:51.611
FELT THAT.

03:49:51.677 --> 03:49:53.479
IN THIS MOVE THAT GO THAT'S TO

03:49:53.546 --> 03:49:55.481
POST THAT'S TO TAKE PLACE IN

03:49:55.548 --> 03:49:56.616
THIS MOVIE THERE'S SOME THERE'S

03:49:56.682 --> 03:49:59.619
A NEED FOR SOME -- SOME ANALYSIS

03:49:59.685 --> 03:50:01.487
AND SOME INPUT AND SOME

03:50:01.554 --> 03:50:03.756
SUGGESTIONS OF OF HOW THE

03:50:03.823 --> 03:50:04.924
PROGRAM SHOULD BE THAT IS NOT

03:50:04.991 --> 03:50:07.093
JUST A MOVEMENT BUT IT REALLY IS.

03:50:07.160 --> 03:50:09.462
A TRYING TO INCORPORATE ALL THE

03:50:09.529 --> 03:50:10.363
GOOD THINGS THAT FOLKS HAVE

03:50:10.429 --> 03:50:12.765
TALKED ABOUT THOSE WHO ADVOCATES

03:50:12.832 --> 03:50:14.600
OUT THERE AND AND MANY OF THEM

03:50:14.667 --> 03:50:17.003
WERE SKEPTICAL ONE OF THE CHANGE

03:50:17.069 --> 03:50:18.504
WHAT WAS SKEPTICAL THAT WAY

03:50:18.571 --> 03:50:19.172
THERE THAT WAS JUST GOING TO BE.

03:50:19.238 --> 03:50:19.805
A MOVING FROM ONE HOUSE TO THE

03:50:19.872 --> 03:50:21.007
NEXT WITH THE SAME PEOPLE WOULD

03:50:21.073 --> 03:50:21.641
BE THE SAME.

03:50:21.707 --> 03:50:28.381
THAT THE SAME ACTIVITIES WOULD

03:50:28.447 --> 03:50:30.383
BE THE SAME AND OUTCOMES BE THE

03:50:30.449 --> 03:50:32.251
SAME BUT MAYBE UNDER DIFFERENT

03:50:32.318 --> 03:50:32.718
NAMES.

03:50:32.785 --> 03:50:34.487
SO I THINKING WAS THAT TO HAPPEN

03:50:34.554 --> 03:50:36.088
ADVISORY COMMITTEE NOT ONLY MADE

03:50:36.155 --> 03:50:37.056
UP THE INDIVIDUALS WHO WORK IN

03:50:37.123 --> 03:50:38.057
THE DEPARTMENT BUT ALL OF THAT

03:50:38.124 --> 03:50:38.724
BUT SOME OF THE ADVOCATES IN THE

03:50:38.791 --> 03:50:39.358
COMMUNITY WHO HAVE SPENT YEARS

03:50:39.425 --> 03:50:40.560
WORKING WITH YOUNG PEOPLE.

03:50:40.626 --> 03:50:41.794
AND SOME OF THEM HAD BEEN AND

03:50:41.861 --> 03:50:42.929
AND IN THE SYSTEM THEMSELVES --

03:50:42.995 --> 03:50:43.829
WHO CAME TO US AND TALK ABOUT

03:50:43.896 --> 03:50:45.064
THE THINGS THEY WERE DOING AND

03:50:45.131 --> 03:50:46.399
HOW WAS NECESSARY TO HAVE

03:50:46.465 --> 03:50:48.501
CERTAIN KINDS OF THINGS IN PLACE

03:50:48.568 --> 03:50:49.468
TO HELP YOUNG PEOPLE TO GROW AND

03:50:49.535 --> 03:50:50.436
DEVELOP AND?

03:50:50.503 --> 03:50:51.938
AND WHY THEY WERE IN THE SYSTEM

03:50:52.004 --> 03:50:53.606
AND WHAT AND HOW TO PREVENT IT

03:50:53.673 --> 03:50:54.874
IN THE FUTURE SO.

03:50:54.941 --> 03:50:56.375
WE THOUGHT AN ADVISORY COMMITTEE

03:50:56.442 --> 03:50:58.311
WOULD BE IN A WOULD BE IMPORTANT

03:50:58.377 --> 03:51:00.213
IN STRUCTURING THE PROGRAMS THAT

03:51:00.279 --> 03:51:02.515
AND AND STRUCTURE A WHAT WOULD

03:51:02.582 --> 03:51:02.815
TAKE PLACE.

03:51:02.882 --> 03:51:05.084
OF THAT IT WOULD NOT BE JUST A

03:51:05.151 --> 03:51:06.118
QUICK THING THAT WE WOULD DO IT

03:51:06.185 --> 03:51:07.653
TO BE OVER AND WE'VE DONE IT AND

03:51:07.720 --> 03:51:09.388
WE SHIFTED FROM ONE PLACE THE

03:51:09.455 --> 03:51:10.556
OTHER NOW LOOKS DIFFERENT

03:51:10.623 --> 03:51:11.357
BECAUSE THIS NEW PAINT.

03:51:11.424 --> 03:51:13.059
AND FACILITIES BUT BASICALLY

03:51:13.125 --> 03:51:14.327
SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE MUCH

03:51:14.393 --> 03:51:16.095
MORE INTERNAL IN TERMS OF WHAT

03:51:16.162 --> 03:51:17.230
THE PROGRAM WOULD LOOK LIKE WITH

THIS ROOM TO TALK ABOUT THAT AND

03:51:35.014 --> 03:51:37.783
TO BEGIN TO FASHION A PROGRAM --

03:51:37.850 --> 03:51:38.684
PRETTY MUCH LIKE MISTER NIELSEN

03:51:39.852 --> 03:51:42.421
AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT EVENT.

03:51:42.488 --> 03:51:43.689
THAT WOULD DOING AND WE SHOULD

03:51:43.756 --> 03:51:45.424
MAKE IT COUNT IT SHOULD MEAN

03:51:45.491 --> 03:51:47.026
SOMETHING IN THE AND AND THAT

03:51:47.093 --> 03:51:48.828
IT'S REALLY REALLY BE A

03:51:48.894 --> 03:51:50.196
DIFFERENT KIND OF INSTITUTION.

03:51:50.263 --> 03:51:51.764
AND MANY OF US TALK ABOUT THINGS

03:51:51.831 --> 03:51:55.368
THAT WE'VE SEEN -- THAT I'VE

03:51:55.434 --> 03:51:56.002
SEEN AS I'VE TRAVELED WORLD AND

03:51:56.068 --> 03:51:56.669
SEE.

03:51:56.736 --> 03:51:58.537
THE GOD AND ONTO THEIR WHAT WE

03:51:58.604 --> 03:52:00.072
WOULD CALL THE JUVENILE HALL AND

03:52:00.139 --> 03:52:01.474
SEE TOTALLY DIFFERENT KIND OF

03:52:01.540 --> 03:52:03.242
PHILOSOPHY OF HOW THEY HANDLE

03:52:03.309 --> 03:52:04.143
YOUNG PEOPLE AND HOW THEY

03:52:04.210 --> 03:52:05.678
REBUILD THEM WITH FAMILIES

03:52:05.745 --> 03:52:06.479
BECAUSE THERE'S SOME XIN IS.

03:52:06.545 --> 03:52:07.980
WHEN KIDS ARE IN TROUBLE IS

03:52:08.047 --> 03:52:08.781
BECAUSE THIS PROBLEMS IN THE

03:52:08.848 --> 03:52:10.082
FAMILY SO YOU GOT A BILL THE

03:52:10.149 --> 03:52:11.050
FAMILY IF YOU'RE GOING TO HELP

03:52:11.117 --> 03:52:11.751

FAMILY?

03:52:12.485 --> 03:52:14.120

03:52:14.186 --> 03:52:14.787
THINGS LIKE THAT THAT IS THE

03:52:14.854 --> 03:52:15.521

03:52:17.023 --> 03:52:17.790
THIS INSTITUTION.

03:52:17.857 --> 03:52:19.191
TAKES AN AWFUL LOT OF MONEY WE

03:52:19.258 --> 03:52:21.060
SPEND OVER THREE HUNDRED

03:52:21.127 --> 03:52:28.768

THERE ARE ASPECTS OF THE

03:58:38.570 --> 03:58:40.506
PROPOSAL THAT ARE DEFINITELY NEW

03:58:40.572 --> 03:58:41.407
AND UNIQUE TO A KERN

03:58:41.473 --> 03:58:43.075
CORRECTIONAL SYSTEM BUT MOST OF

03:58:43.142 --> 03:58:44.376
THESE COMPONENTS ARE EVIDENCE

03:58:44.443 --> 03:58:46.445
BASED FAIRS ASSESSMENTS.

03:58:46.512 --> 03:58:48.147
AND THERE'S TREATMENT AND

03:58:48.213 --> 03:58:48.747
THERE'S FOLLOW UP AND THERE'S

MOVING THROUGH LEVELS OF CARE

03:58:49.815 --> 03:58:51.450
AND ALL THOSE THINGS GENERALLY

03:58:51.517 --> 03:58:53.152
SPEAKING ARE EVIDENCE BASED.

03:58:53.218 --> 03:58:55.587
BUT IT HASN'T BEEN TESTED AND IN

03:58:55.654 --> 03:58:57.022
THIS EXACT SETTING BUT THERE

03:58:57.089 --> 03:58:58.390
MOST OF THESE PIECES HAVE

03:58:58.457 --> 03:59:00.225
ACTUALLY BEEN REVIEWED AS

03:59:00.292 --> 03:59:04.463
APPROPRIATE AND IN THE WAY OF

03:59:04.530 --> 03:59:07.366
ADMINISTERING THE PROGRAM.

03:59:07.433 --> 03:59:10.335
QUESTION FOR MEMBERS TO NIELSEN.

03:59:10.402 --> 03:59:12.237
WE'RE TALKING A LOT ABOUT.

03:59:12.304 --> 03:59:13.739
THE DRUGS THAT ARE NOW

03:59:13.806 --> 03:59:14.039
[inaudible]

03:59:14.106 --> 03:59:15.274
IN [inaudible]

03:59:15.340 --> 03:59:18.744
THE PRISON.

03:59:18.811 --> 03:59:20.813
THE CITY SHE ARE.

03:59:20.879 --> 03:59:24.583
HAVE ANY NEW IDEAS ABOUT.

03:59:24.650 --> 03:59:26.819
INTERCEPTING THE INCOMING

03:59:26.885 --> 03:59:27.119
[inaudible]

03:59:27.186 --> 03:59:32.224
DRUGS. FOR EXAMPLE SOME COME IN

03:59:32.291 --> 03:59:36.028
THROUGH THE FIRE CAMPS.

03:59:36.095 --> 03:59:38.564
THAT'S NOT THE BIGGEST PLACES.

03:59:38.630 --> 03:59:40.332
I'M TALKING ABOUT THAT WOULD

03:59:40.399 --> 03:59:42.201
GETS INTO THE INSTITUTION.

03:59:42.267 --> 03:59:43.635
YEAH I SO I THINK THERE HAVE

03:59:43.702 --> 03:59:45.404
BEEN PROPOSALS OVER THE LAST EW

03:59:45.471 --> 03:59:47.606
YEARS ABOUT INTERDICTION EFFORTS

03:59:47.673 --> 03:59:49.408
I THINK LAST YEAR FUNDED A PILOT

03:59:49.475 --> 03:59:52.177
AT ONE INSTITUTION TO DO TWENTY

03:59:52.244 --> 03:59:53.645
FOUR SEVEN SORT OF SCREENING --

03:59:53.712 --> 03:59:55.013
TO INTERDICT DRUGS THERE'S BEEN

03:59:55.080 --> 03:59:57.316
PREVIOUS PROPOSALS I THINK THIS

03:59:57.382 --> 03:59:58.817
COMMITTEE HEARD RELATED TO THE

03:59:58.884 --> 04:00:01.086
USE OF NINES FOR INTERDICTION --

04:00:01.153 --> 04:00:03.188
I THINK THE THE KEY COMPONENT

04:00:03.255 --> 04:00:06.892
HERE IS THAT THERE'S EVEN ON THE

04:00:06.959 --> 04:00:07.860
IF YOU LOOK AT THE INTERDICTION

04:00:07.926 --> 04:00:10.162
EFFORTS THERE'S STILL SORT OF

04:00:10.229 --> 04:00:11.730
SIGNIFICANT NEED FOR SUBSTANCE

04:00:11.797 --> 04:00:12.931
USE DISORDER TREATMENT THAT'S

04:00:12.998 --> 04:00:15.534
DONE IN A NEW WAY ABSOLUTELY I

04:00:15.601 --> 04:00:15.901
WOULD NOT IN.

04:00:15.968 --> 04:00:18.370
STATE YOU'D EVER GOING TO STOP

04:00:18.437 --> 04:00:20.239
ENOUGH GETTING IN.

04:00:20.305 --> 04:00:22.708
NO OF TREATMENT IS IS ESSENTIAL.

04:00:22.775 --> 04:00:24.576
BUT A TREATMENT ALSO NEEDS TO

04:00:24.643 --> 04:00:26.812
FOLLOW THE INMATE.

04:00:26.879 --> 04:00:29.915
BACK OUT INTO SOCIETY AS WELL.

04:00:29.982 --> 04:00:32.751

04:03:53.852 --> 04:03:55.554
A GOOD AMOUNT OF RESEARCH

04:03:55.620 --> 04:03:55.854
[inaudible]

04:03:55.921 --> 04:03:58.657

WHETHER THE ONES THAT GOT FUNDED

04:04:07.165 --> 04:04:10.969
HAVE FOLLOWED THE TYPE OF AREA.

04:04:11.036 --> 04:04:12.504
THAT THE RESEARCH SHOWS REALLY

04:04:12.571 --> 04:04:14.306
WORKS.

04:04:14.373 --> 04:04:16.041
YOU KNOW I CAN'T SAY BECAUSE I

04:04:16.108 --> 04:04:18.377
HAVEN'T LOOKED AT WHAT -- WHAT

04:04:18.443 --> 04:04:21.380
THE RECENT -- ENTITIES THAT WERE

04:04:21.446 --> 04:04:23.015
FUNDED IN THE MOST RECENT ROUNDS

04:04:23.081 --> 04:04:25.917
FOR BE A CC BUT CERTAINLY WHAT I

04:04:25.984 --> 04:04:29.388
IF THE REPORT SHOWS THAT WE NEED

04:04:29.454 --> 04:04:31.089
TO IMPROVE THE CRITERIA.

04:04:31.156 --> 04:04:33.725
THAT WOULD BE -- GREAT -- BUT I

04:04:33.792 --> 04:04:35.694
THINK WE WOULDN'T WANT IF IT

04:04:35.761 --> 04:04:38.663
CHOSE PERHAPS.

04:04:38.730 --> 04:04:39.931
SOME ISSUES AROUND AFFECTED MISS.

04:04:39.998 --> 04:04:42.200
IT WOULDN'T BE A MATTER OF THAT

04:04:42.267 --> 04:04:43.969
VIOLENCE INTERVENTION PROGRAMS

04:04:44.036 --> 04:04:45.470
ARE AN EFFECTIVE IT MIGHT BE A

04:04:45.537 --> 04:04:47.939
MATTER OF THE CRITERIA WE ARE

04:04:48.006 --> 04:04:49.474
USING BECAUSE THERE IS A GREAT

04:04:49.541 --> 04:04:51.476
DEAL OF BODY OF RESEARCH ON THE

04:04:51.543 --> 04:04:52.611
EFFECTIVENESS OF IT.

04:04:52.677 --> 04:04:53.845
AND IN FACT THERE'S EVEN

04:04:53.912 --> 04:04:56.181
DOCUMENTATION ON LOWERED GUN

04:04:56.248 --> 04:04:58.250
VIOLENCE RATES IN THOSE

04:04:58.316 --> 04:04:59.885
COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN

04:04:59.951 --> 04:05:02.320
RESEARCHED -- IN OAKLAND IS ONE

04:05:02.387 --> 04:05:05.891
OF THEM FOR EXAMPLE SO -- JUST

04:05:05.957 --> 04:05:07.759
BAD DATA BECAUSE I THINK THAT WE

04:05:07.826 --> 04:05:09.561
THERE IS GOOD RESEARCH SHOWING

04:05:09.628 --> 04:05:11.630
THAT APPROPRIATELY USE THESE

04:05:11.696 --> 04:05:15.167
VIOLENCE INTERVENTION PROGRAMS

04:05:15.233 --> 04:05:16.768
ARE QUITE EFFECTIVE.

04:05:16.835 --> 04:05:17.402
THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS.

NEW PROGRAMS IN CERTAIN AREAS

04:06:20.899 --> 04:06:24.236
AND THEN EXPANSIONS AND OTHERS.

04:06:24.302 --> 04:06:25.837
THE ASSEMBLY APPROVED -- THIS

04:06:25.904 --> 04:06:28.373
FUNDING ON A ONE TIME BASIS --

IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY

04:06:30.108 --> 04:06:31.076
AND THE MONEY IS GENERALLY

04:06:31.143 --> 04:06:32.410
CONTENTION ON THE ENACTMENT OF

04:06:32.477 --> 04:06:33.812
LEGISLATION CHANGING THE CURRENT

DEADLY FORC.

04:06:38.049 --> 04:06:39.718
THE FUDS WOULD GENERALLY BE

04:06:39.784 --> 04:06:41.586
USED TO HELP TRAIN THE OFFICERS

04:06:41.653 --> 04:06:43.622
ON THAT NEW STANDARD -- AND WE

04:06:43.688 --> 04:06:45.157
WOULD KNOW THAT THREE MILLION OF

04:06:45.223 --> 04:06:46.091
THE TOTAL AMOUNT WOULD BE

04:06:46.158 --> 04:06:48.527
ONGOING IN NATURE FOR POST KIND

04:06:48.593 --> 04:06:50.195
OF ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS.

04:06:50.262 --> 04:06:51.229
ADDITIONALLY THE ASSEMBLY

04:06:53.398 --> 04:06:54.900
REQUIRING ANNUAL REPORTING.

04:06:54.966 --> 04:06:55.967
AND THE OVERALL EFFECTIVENESS OF

PER OFFICER TRAINED.

04:07:11.983 --> 04:07:13.118
AND SO THE ISSUES AND CONFERENCE

04:07:13.185 --> 04:07:15.187
ARE WHETHER THE FUNDING IS ONE

04:07:15.253 --> 04:07:17.088

ON THIS PACKAGE ESSENTIALLY WE

04:07:25.130 --> 04:07:25.931
DO THINK IT'S AN ISSUE OF

04:07:25.997 --> 04:07:27.699
LEGISLATIVE PRIORITY IN TERMS OF

04:07:27.766 --> 04:07:29.000
HOW MUCH MONEY TO PROVIDE

WHATEVER PACKAGE THE LEGISLATURE

04:07:39.377 --> 04:07:41.246
DOES CHOOSE TO ADOPT THE FIRST

04:07:41.313 --> 04:07:42.514
IS AND WHATEVER PACKAGE THAT'S

04:07:42.581 --> 04:07:44.015
ADOPTED WE DO RECOMMEND THAT THE

04:07:44.082 --> 04:07:45.283
LEGISLATURE ENSURE.

04:07:45.350 --> 04:07:46.818
THAT THEIR EXPECTATIONS AND

04:07:46.885 --> 04:07:51.223
PRIORITIES RECOMMEND ADOPTING

04:07:51.289 --> 04:07:52.691
THE ASSEMBLY IS BUDGET BILL

04:07:52.757 --> 04:07:54.593
LANGUAGE ON REPORTING THAT WOULD

04:07:54.659 --> 04:07:55.460
DEFINITELY PROVIDE THE

04:07:55.527 --> 04:07:56.428
LEGISLATURE WITH MORE

04:07:56.494 --> 04:07:58.830
INFORMATION ON THE IMPACT.

04:07:58.897 --> 04:08:00.498
THE FUNDING HAD UPON TRAINING

04:08:00.565 --> 04:08:01.900
AND THAT WOULD HELP INFORM

04:08:01.967 --> 04:08:02.634
LEGISLATIVE DECISIONS IN THE

04:08:02.701 --> 04:08:04.703
FUTURE ABOUT WHERE TO PUT

04:08:04.769 --> 04:08:06.137
RESOURCES AND HOW MUCH IS

04:08:06.204 --> 04:08:08.273
NECESSARY TO ACHIEVE THE GOALS

04:08:08.340 --> 04:08:15.747
ARE INTERESTED IN [inaudible]

04:08:15.814 --> 04:08:17.215
FINANCE PLEASE.

04:08:17.282 --> 04:08:18.683
WE SUPPORT THE SENATE ACTION ON

04:08:18.750 --> 04:08:19.951
THIS PROPOSAL AND I'LL MAKE TWO

04:08:20.018 --> 04:08:23.021
BRIEF POINTS THE FIRST IS THAT.

04:08:23.088 --> 04:08:24.489
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THE NATURE

04:08:24.556 --> 04:08:25.290
OF THE FUNDING GIVEN THE

04:08:25.357 --> 04:08:26.524
IMPORTANCE THE ADMINISTRATION

04:08:26.591 --> 04:08:27.792
PLACES ON THIS PROGRAM AND THE

04:08:27.859 --> 04:08:28.994
ISSUE THAT IT'S INTENDED TO

04:08:29.060 --> 04:08:29.794
ADDRESS.

04:08:29.861 --> 04:08:31.263
WE BELIEVE THAT THIS FUNDING

04:08:31.329 --> 04:08:33.164
SHOULD BE ON GOING AND THEN THE

04:08:33.231 --> 04:08:35.267
SECOND POINT IS WITH REGARD --

04:08:35.333 --> 04:08:37.068
TO WHERE THIS FUNDING IS GOING --

04:08:37.135 --> 04:08:38.203
FOURTEEN POINT NINE MILLION IS

04:08:38.270 --> 04:08:39.804
TO RESTORE OPPOSED TO ITS

04:08:39.871 --> 04:08:41.172
HISTORICAL LEVEL OF FUNDING WHEN

04:08:41.239 --> 04:08:43.275
IT COMES TO THE REMAINING TWENTY

04:08:43.341 --> 04:08:44.009
MILLION DOLLARS THE

04:08:44.075 --> 04:08:46.111
ADMINISTRATION IS OPEN TO WAYS

04:08:46.177 --> 04:08:48.079
OF DIRECTING THAT FUNDING --

04:08:48.146 --> 04:08:49.948
SPECIFICALLY -- AIMING THESE

04:08:50.015 --> 04:08:51.216
RICH RESOURCES AT DE ESCALATION

04:08:51.283 --> 04:08:52.617
PROGRAMS WHICH WE KNOW IS A

04:08:52.684 --> 04:08:53.518
CONCERN UT FOR THE

04:08:53.585 --> 04:08:57.255
ADMINISTRATION AND MANY MEMBERS

04:08:57.322 --> 04:08:59.457
OF THE LEGISLATURE [inaudible]

04:08:59.524 --> 04:09:08.300
QUESTIONS COMMENTS.

04:09:08.366 --> 04:09:09.567
THANK YOU EVER YES I'D OUT MY

04:09:09.634 --> 04:09:13.004
LOSING TO THE COMPROMISE AND AND

04:09:13.071 --> 04:09:14.406
I THINK THERE COULD WITH WHERE

04:09:14.472 --> 04:09:15.206
WE'RE AT VARIOUS PLACES BUT I

04:09:15.273 --> 04:09:16.141
THINK WE'RE PROBABLY THE SAME

04:09:16.207 --> 04:09:18.543
CONVERSATION. ONE OF THE THINGS

04:09:18.610 --> 04:09:19.944
THAT -- WE DID AND AND COMMITTEE

04:09:20.011 --> 04:09:21.746
AND WE WERE LISTENING TO LA LA --

04:09:21.813 --> 04:09:23.048
IS THAT YOU KNOW UNLESS WE

04:09:23.114 --> 04:09:24.849
IDENTIFIED -- AT SOME POINT WE

04:09:24.916 --> 04:09:25.984
KNOW THERE'S A NEED FOR SOME

04:09:26.051 --> 04:09:27.919
ADDITIONAL MONEY THIS ON GOING

04:09:27.986 --> 04:09:29.421
BECAUSE OF THE SUFFERING WHAT

04:09:29.487 --> 04:09:30.855
WHAT THEY'VE HAD IN THE PAST IN

04:09:30.922 --> 04:09:32.324
TERMS OF REDUCTION SO YOU WANT

04:09:32.390 --> 04:09:34.492
TO STABILIZE ADMINISTRATION OF

04:09:34.559 --> 04:09:34.793
IT.

04:09:34.859 --> 04:09:36.328
BUT IF WE'RE TALKING YOU KNOW WE

04:09:36.394 --> 04:09:38.129
HAVE TO IDENTIFY WHAT WE WANT

04:09:38.196 --> 04:09:39.397
PEOPLE TO DO WITH THE MONEY.

04:09:39.464 --> 04:09:41.232
ESPECIALLY IF IF IF WE CREATE

04:09:41.299 --> 04:09:43.735
POLICY OF THAT THAT DEMANDS A

04:09:43.802 --> 04:09:45.003
DIFFERENT LEVEL OF TRAINING WE

04:09:45.070 --> 04:09:46.471
HAVE TO FUND THAT TRAINING AND

04:09:46.538 --> 04:09:47.505
AND THAT'S WHAT WE COMMITTED TO

04:09:47.572 --> 04:09:48.139
DO.

04:09:48.206 --> 04:09:49.641
THE FUN TRAINING SO THAT WE

04:09:49.708 --> 04:09:52.010
COULD REDUCE THE NUMBER OF OF

04:09:52.077 --> 04:09:54.112
DEADLY FORCE EFFORTS AND THINGS

04:09:54.179 --> 04:09:55.613
BEING USED OF IN THE GOVERNOR

04:09:55.680 --> 04:09:56.047
AGREES WITH THAT.

04:09:56.114 --> 04:09:57.849
SO WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO

04:09:57.916 --> 04:09:59.384
THAT AND AND I SAY THAT BECAUSE

04:09:59.451 --> 04:10:01.786
LAST YEAR WE GAVE AN ADDITIONAL

04:10:01.853 --> 04:10:03.154
TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN

04:10:03.221 --> 04:10:05.090
THE BUDGET -- AND FIVE IT WAS

04:10:05.156 --> 04:10:06.358
SUPPOSED TO BE FOR SPECIAL

04:10:06.424 --> 04:10:08.326
GRANTS OF THE OTHER TWENTY WAS

04:10:08.393 --> 04:10:09.527
SUPPOSED TO BEGIN AND HOPEFULLY

04:10:09.594 --> 04:10:11.629
THE TRAINING AND DE ESCALATION

04:10:11.696 --> 04:10:12.897
AND IT WASN'T DONE IT WAS IN USE

04:10:12.964 --> 04:10:13.732
FOR THAT.

04:10:13.798 --> 04:10:15.633
AND SO AND WITHOUT SOME

04:10:15.700 --> 04:10:17.369
LANGUAGES SAYS THIS IS WHAT WE

04:10:17.435 --> 04:10:19.337
EXPECT -- AND WE FIND IT TO BE

04:10:19.404 --> 04:10:20.638
TRUE IN A WHOLE LOT OF PROGRAMS

04:10:20.705 --> 04:10:22.741
IS NOT JUST THIS -- ONE BUT

04:10:22.807 --> 04:10:24.075
WE'RE BEING TOLD ALL CONSTANTLY

04:10:24.142 --> 04:10:26.244
THAT IF YOU IF YOU GIVE MONEY

04:10:26.311 --> 04:10:27.345
YOU DON'T DIRECT FOR YOU THINK

04:10:27.412 --> 04:10:29.180
IT'LL GO WITH IT'S AN EDUCATION

04:10:29.247 --> 04:10:29.848
WERE EVER.

04:10:29.914 --> 04:10:31.116
ANY GOALS FOR WHATEVER PEOPLE

04:10:31.182 --> 04:10:31.950
FEEL IT NEEDS TO HAPPEN AT THAT

04:10:32.016 --> 04:10:34.185
MOMENT AND THEN AS A LEGISLATURE

04:10:34.252 --> 04:10:35.620
WILL UPSET BECAUSE IT WOULD COME

04:10:35.687 --> 04:10:36.921
BACK AND LOOK AND SEE THAT THE

04:10:36.988 --> 04:10:37.889
PROGRAMS ARE NOT IMPLEMENTED.

04:10:37.956 --> 04:10:39.591
BOB WE RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS

04:10:39.657 --> 04:10:40.692
ONLY THE BEGINNING OF FUNDING

04:10:40.759 --> 04:10:42.026
THEY'LL BE A LOT MORE FUNDING

04:10:42.093 --> 04:10:44.062
NEEDED TO TO REALLY CHANGE THE

04:10:44.129 --> 04:10:45.663
CULTURAL POLICING IN CALIFORNIA.

04:10:45.730 --> 04:10:47.065
BUT IT WOULD IF WE'RE GOING TO

04:10:47.132 --> 04:10:48.099
START IT WE HAVE TO START WITH

04:10:48.166 --> 04:10:49.434
AN UNDERSTANDING THAT THE

04:10:49.501 --> 04:10:51.102
MONEY'S GOING IN THAT DIRECTION

04:10:51.169 --> 04:10:53.037
WHETHER ITS ONGOING COST OR

04:10:53.104 --> 04:10:54.572
WHATEVER IT MAY BE THE IDEA OF

04:10:54.639 --> 04:10:55.874
REPORTING BACK IN TERMS OF

04:10:55.940 --> 04:10:56.608
TELLING US.

04:10:56.674 --> 04:10:57.976
WHAT YOU DID WITH THE MONEY

04:10:58.042 --> 04:10:59.644
SETTING OUT SOME GOALS AND

04:10:59.711 --> 04:11:07.752
OBJECTIVES VERTICALLY MARY OF

04:11:07.819 --> 04:11:09.721
TRAINING SO THAT THE CURRICULUM

04:11:09.788 --> 04:11:11.122
BEING DEVELOPED IS BEING

04:11:11.189 --> 04:11:11.890
DEVELOPED IN IT WHAT THE

04:11:11.956 --> 04:11:12.824
PARTICULAR GOAL IN MIND?

04:11:12.891 --> 04:11:13.925
OTHERWISE WE WOULD JUST TRAINING

04:11:13.992 --> 04:11:14.793
FOLKS WE HAVE NO WAY OF

04:11:14.859 --> 04:11:15.393
DETERMINING WHETHER NOT WE'RE

04:11:15.460 --> 04:11:16.628
GOING TO COMP WAS THE GOALS THAT

04:11:16.694 --> 04:11:17.362
WE SET BECAUSE WE'RE NOT.

04:11:17.429 --> 04:11:17.962
SAYING THIS IS WHAT NEEDS TO

04:11:18.029 --> 04:11:19.497
HAPPEN -- WE DO THAT IN MANY

04:11:19.564 --> 04:11:20.365
AREAS OR THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

04:11:20.432 --> 04:11:22.033
YOU KNOW WHEN WE CHANGED OUR

04:11:22.100 --> 04:11:22.634
CURRICULUM PUBLIC SCHOOLS WE

04:11:22.700 --> 04:11:23.268
GAVE UP ABOUT HOW MANY MILLIONS

04:11:23.334 --> 04:11:24.636
OF DOLLARS BILLION DOLLARS

04:11:24.702 --> 04:11:25.670
WHATEVER IT WAS. TO BASICALLY

04:11:25.737 --> 04:11:26.571
TRAIN THEM ON THE NEW CURRICULA

04:11:26.638 --> 04:11:27.539
WHY BECAUSE WE WANT THE

04:11:27.605 --> 04:11:28.907
CURRICULUM TO BE IMPLEMENTED

04:11:28.973 --> 04:11:31.109
WITH ONE SOME SENSE OF THE DELI

04:11:31.176 --> 04:11:31.743
WE JUST GAVE A MONIES THEY HAVE

04:11:31.810 --> 04:11:33.077
STAFF DEVELOPMENT WE KNOW WHAT

04:11:33.144 --> 04:11:34.245
HAPPENS EVERYTHING HAPPENS.

04:11:34.312 --> 04:11:35.046
OTHER THAN WHAT WE WANT TO

04:11:35.113 --> 04:11:37.081
HAPPEN AND SO I I THINK IT'S

04:11:37.148 --> 04:11:39.083
IMPORTANT AS WE TALK ABOUT WHAT

04:11:39.150 --> 04:11:40.385
WE WANT TO DO IS A COLLABORATIVE

04:11:40.452 --> 04:11:42.086
IN TERMS OF PULLING THE THE

04:11:42.153 --> 04:11:44.456
VARIOUS PROPOSALS TOGETHER.

04:11:44.522 --> 04:11:45.690
THAT WE KNOW THAT SOMEONE WILL

04:11:45.757 --> 04:11:46.324
THERE'S SOME FUNNY THE NEEDS TO

04:11:46.391 --> 04:11:47.525
HAPPEN TO BASICALLY STABILIZE

04:11:47.592 --> 04:11:48.560
THE STRUCTURE GIVE THEM THE

04:11:48.626 --> 04:11:49.861
THINGS THEY NEED WHAT IT'S FORTY

04:11:49.928 --> 04:11:51.095
MILLION WHATEVER IT IS.

04:11:51.162 --> 04:11:52.130
BUT IF YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT

04:11:52.197 --> 04:11:53.465
TRAINING DOLLARS WE NEED TO

04:11:53.531 --> 04:11:55.033
IDENTIFY THE TRAINING THAT WE

04:11:55.099 --> 04:11:56.501
HAVE SET FORTH THAT WE THINK IS

04:11:56.568 --> 04:11:57.836
GOING TO MOVE US TO A DIFFERENT

04:11:57.902 --> 04:11:59.471
KIND OF CULTURAL POLICING.

04:11:59.537 --> 04:12:00.338
IN CALIFORNIA AND THAT WILL BE

04:12:00.405 --> 04:12:02.373
VERY IMPORTANT AND IN FACT IN

04:12:02.440 --> 04:12:03.942
ALL OF OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH

04:12:04.008 --> 04:12:04.876
LAW ENFORCEMENT THEY MADE VERY

04:12:04.943 --> 04:12:05.877
CLEAR IF WE'RE GOING TO

04:12:05.944 --> 04:12:07.278
IMPLEMENT THIS WE HAVE TO HAVE

04:12:07.345 --> 04:12:08.813
RESOURCES TO DO IT.

04:12:08.880 --> 04:12:09.714
WE HAVE TO HAVE THE TRAINING TO

04:12:09.781 --> 04:12:12.050
ACCOMPLISH IT AND I TOTALLY

04:12:12.116 --> 04:12:12.684
AGREE WITH THAT AND THAT'S WHY

04:12:12.750 --> 04:12:13.685
LAST YEAR WE GIVEN TWENTY FIVE

04:12:13.751 --> 04:12:15.353
MILLION DOLLARS. TO BEGIN THE

04:12:15.420 --> 04:12:16.855
PROCESS THAT DIDN'T GET. TO GET

04:12:16.921 --> 04:12:18.423
STARTED SO THIS TWENTY MILLION

04:12:18.490 --> 04:12:19.691
WILL BE ON TOP OF THE OTHER

04:12:19.757 --> 04:12:20.825
TWENTY THAT THEY ALREADY HAVE

04:12:20.892 --> 04:12:23.094
ACCESS -- TO AS WELL AS IN THE

04:12:23.161 --> 04:12:24.863

FIFTY SO WE WERE GIVING SOMEONE

04:12:27.932 --> 04:12:29.100
YEAR HOPEFULLY WE WILL DO SOME

04:12:29.167 --> 04:12:30.401
MORE BECAUSE I KNOW THAT A LOT

04:12:30.468 --> 04:12:31.936
OF OTHER THINGS DEALING WITH

04:12:32.003 --> 04:12:33.471
MENTAL HEALTH AND ALL OF THE

04:12:33.538 --> 04:12:34.005
KINDS OF TRAINING THAT.

04:12:34.072 --> 04:12:35.540
WE HAVE TO DO BUT IF WE'RE GOING

04:12:35.607 --> 04:12:37.308
TO EXPECT SOMETHING TO COME FROM

04:12:37.375 --> 04:12:38.343
THAT WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT

04:12:38.409 --> 04:12:45.149
WE'RE CLEAR ABOUT WHAT OUR

04:12:45.216 --> 04:12:47.485
