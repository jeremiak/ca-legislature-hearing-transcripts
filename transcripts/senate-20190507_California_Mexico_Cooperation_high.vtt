TO THE BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP.

00:09:10.816 --> 00:09:11.951
HAS BEEN AFOLK PROCHE FOCUSED

00:09:12.018 --> 00:09:13.552
ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY ON

IMMIGRATION AND TRADE.

00:09:14.654 --> 00:09:16.455
A FOCUS THE BLAMES MEXICO FOR

00:09:16.522 --> 00:09:18.024
THESE PROBLEMS DESPITE THERE

00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:19.492
BEING REGIONAL IN NATURE.

00:09:19.558 --> 00:09:23.362
AND A FOCUS IT DOESN'T SEEK TO

00:09:23.429 --> 00:09:23.963
CREATE CREATE OF CROSS BORDER

00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:24.830
COLLABORATION TO DEAL WITH OUR

00:09:24.897 --> 00:09:27.867
SHARED PROBLEMS AND ARE COMMON --

00:09:27.934 --> 00:09:30.002
OPPORTUNITIES -- BUT WITH LESS

00:09:30.069 --> 00:09:31.037
WELL KNOWN AS THE MEXICAN

00:09:31.103 --> 00:09:32.405
APPROACH TO THE BILATERAL

00:09:32.471 --> 00:09:33.706
RELATIONSHIP AND THE WAY IN

00:09:33.773 --> 00:09:35.574
WHICH IT ACTUALLY COMPLIMENTS

00:09:35.641 --> 00:09:36.575
THE WHITE HOUSE IS LACK OF

00:09:36.642 --> 00:09:37.443
INTEREST.

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:39.111
IN BILATERAL GATE ENGAGEMENT TO

00:09:39.178 --> 00:09:40.613
SOLVE OUR SHARED PROBLEMS R TO

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:42.014
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF OUR SHARED

00:09:42.081 --> 00:09:44.283
OPPORTUNITIES. FOR MEXICO'S

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:45.618
PRESIDENT ANDRES MANUEL LOPEZ

00:09:45.685 --> 00:09:48.054
OBRADOR AN AMATEUR HISTORIAN.

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:50.022
THE HISTORY OF MEXICO AND ITS

00:09:50.089 --> 00:09:51.357
RELATIONS WITH THE UNITED STATES

00:09:51.424 --> 00:09:52.959
AS IT'S TAUGHT IN MEXICO IS IN

00:09:53.025 --> 00:09:54.226
THE FOREFRONT OF HIS THINKING

00:09:54.293 --> 00:09:56.696
ABOUT THE BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP.

00:09:56.762 --> 00:09:57.663
SO WHAT IS IT THAT AND LOW IN

00:09:57.730 --> 00:09:59.265
MOST MEXICANS THINK ABOUT WHEN

00:09:59.332 --> 00:10:00.833
THEY THINK ABOUT HISTORY.

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:01.667
I THINK THAT THE UNITED STATES

00:10:01.734 --> 00:10:03.169
TOOK HALF OF MEXICO'S TERRITORY

00:10:03.235 --> 00:10:04.804
IN EIGHTEEN FORTY EIGHT AFTER A

00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:05.671
BRIEF.

00:10:05.738 --> 00:10:06.505
FOR THEY THINK THAT IN THE EARLY

00:10:06.572 --> 00:10:07.840
TWENTIETH CENTURY THE UNITED

00:10:07.907 --> 00:10:10.009
STATES CONSTANTLY INTERVENED IN

00:10:10.076 --> 00:10:11.377
MEXICAN INTERNAL AFFAIRS. TO

00:10:11.444 --> 00:10:12.378
INFLUENCE THE COURSE OF THE

00:10:12.445 --> 00:10:13.846
MEXICAN REVOLUTION AND TO

00:10:13.913 --> 00:10:15.348
PRESSURE MEXICO TO IMPLEMENT ITS

00:10:15.414 --> 00:10:18.451
POST REVOLUTIONARY CONSTITUTION.

00:10:18.517 --> 00:10:19.352
IN A MANNER THAT MAX SURPRISED

00:10:19.418 --> 00:10:22.021
US NOT MEXICAN INTERESTS.

00:10:22.088 --> 00:10:23.589
MEXICAN FOREIGN POLICY FOR MOST

00:10:23.656 --> 00:10:24.757
OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY WAS

00:10:24.824 --> 00:10:26.158
THUS GEARED TOWARD KEEPING

00:10:26.225 --> 00:10:27.860
UNITED STATES AT ARMS LENGTH.

00:10:27.927 --> 00:10:29.128
AND TO PREVENT IS THERE FOR FROM

00:10:29.195 --> 00:10:30.696
INTERVENING IN MEXICAN INTERNAL

00:10:30.763 --> 00:10:32.031
AFFAIRS.

00:10:32.098 --> 00:10:33.466
THAT'S WHY THIS PAST QUARTER OF

00:10:33.532 --> 00:10:34.633
A CENTURY OF U. S. MEXICO

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:36.635
RELATIONS A PERIOD OF CLOSE BY

00:10:36.702 --> 00:10:38.404
NATIONAL COLLABORATION TO DEAL

00:10:38.471 --> 00:10:40.172
WITH COMMON PROBLEMS AND ADVANCE

00:10:40.239 --> 00:10:41.474
SHARED OPPORTUNITIES HAS BEEN SO

00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:43.509
STRIKING.

00:10:43.576 --> 00:10:44.510
MEXICAN FOREIGN POLICY UNDER THE

00:10:44.577 --> 00:10:46.645
LOPEZ OBRADOR ADMINISTRATION

00:10:46.712 --> 00:10:48.114
HOWEVER IS A BIT OF A THROWBACK.

00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:49.048
IT HAS MANY OF THE

00:10:49.115 --> 00:10:50.716
CHARACTERISTICS OF THE PRE

00:10:50.783 --> 00:10:51.717
NINETEEN NINETIES MEXCAN

00:10:51.784 --> 00:10:53.819
FOREIGN POLICY OF KEEPING UNITED

00:10:53.886 --> 00:10:55.588
STATES AT ARMS DISTANCE.

00:10:55.654 --> 00:10:56.856
LOPEZ OBRADOR FIRMLY BELIEVES IN

00:10:56.922 --> 00:10:57.923
THE IMPORTANCE OF BUILDING

00:10:57.990 --> 00:10:59.759
MEXICAN NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY AND

00:10:59.825 --> 00:11:00.693
A TIME TO ME.

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:02.628
AND HE IS CONSTANTLY COGNIZANT

00:11:02.695 --> 00:11:03.696
OF THE POWER DIFFERENTIAL

00:11:03.763 --> 00:11:05.264
BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND

00:11:05.331 --> 00:11:05.998
MEXICO.

00:11:06.065 --> 00:11:07.767
AND THIS THIS STRONGLY INFORMS

00:11:07.833 --> 00:11:08.968
HIS CONCEPTION OF WHAT A

00:11:09.035 --> 00:11:10.870
COMPROMISE IS A GOOD FOREIGN

00:11:10.936 --> 00:11:12.938
POLICY.

00:11:13.005 --> 00:11:13.572
LOCUSTS OVER THERE BELIEVES THE

00:11:13.639 --> 00:11:16.008
BEST FOREIGN POLICY IS A STRONG

00:11:16.075 --> 00:11:17.443
DOMESTIC POLICY.

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:19.245
MEXICO SHOULD NOT WASTE OF TIME

00:11:19.311 --> 00:11:20.613
AND RESOURCES MEDDLING IN WORLD

00:11:20.679 --> 00:11:22.648
AFFAIRS BUT SHOULD INSTEAD FOCUS

00:11:22.715 --> 00:11:23.983
ITS EFFORTS ON STRENGTHENING

00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:25.151
ITSELF POLITICALLY AND

00:11:25.217 --> 00:11:26.819
ESPECIALLY ECONOMICALLY.

00:11:26.886 --> 00:11:28.187
HE ALSO BELIEVES THAT THE POWER

00:11:28.254 --> 00:11:29.522
DIFFERENTIAL BETWEEN OUR TWO

00:11:29.588 --> 00:11:31.090
COUNTRIES MEANS THAT MEXICO

00:11:31.157 --> 00:11:32.558
SHOULD NEVER GIVE UNITED STATES

00:11:32.625 --> 00:11:34.493
AN EXCUSE TO INTERFERE IN

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:36.295
MEXICAN AFFAIRS. FOR OUR

00:11:36.362 --> 00:11:38.364
PURPOSES THAT TODAY THIS HAS ONE

00:11:38.431 --> 00:11:39.765
MAIN IMPLICATION FOR MEXICAN

00:11:39.832 --> 00:11:41.200
FOREIGN POLICY.

00:11:41.267 --> 00:11:42.401
THE LOCALS OVER LOWER GOVERNMENT

00:11:42.468 --> 00:11:44.170
HAS NOT AND WILL NOT RESPOND TO

00:11:44.236 --> 00:11:46.672
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S PROVOCATIONS.

00:11:46.739 --> 00:11:48.441
AFTER EACH HAS TO A HOSTILE ACT

00:11:48.507 --> 00:11:50.109
A RHETORICAL OUTBURSTS LOPEZ

00:11:50.176 --> 00:11:51.477
OBRADOR'S POSITION HAS BEEN

00:11:51.544 --> 00:11:52.645
CONSISTENT.

00:11:52.711 --> 00:11:54.346
IT IS THE U. S. SOVEREIGN RIGHT

00:11:54.413 --> 00:11:55.281
TO SET ITS OWN IMMIGRATION

00:11:55.347 --> 00:11:57.249
POLICY AND TO BUILD A WALL IF IT

00:11:57.316 --> 00:11:59.985
WANTS TO MEXICO WILL NOT COMMENT.

00:12:00.052 --> 00:12:01.587
AT THE SAME TIME MEXICO DOES NOT

00:12:01.654 --> 00:12:03.589
WANT ANY PROBLEMS WITH UNITED

00:12:03.656 --> 00:12:05.057
STATES.

00:12:05.124 --> 00:12:05.658
PROBLEMS THAT MIGHT LEAD TO A

00:12:05.724 --> 00:12:06.659
CENTER INTERFERENCE IN MEXICAN

00:12:06.725 --> 00:12:08.427
INTERNAL AFFAIRS OR MIGHT

00:12:08.494 --> 00:12:10.663
OTHERWISE DISTRACT LOPEZ OBRADOR

00:12:10.729 --> 00:12:12.565
FROM HIS DOMESTIC AGENDA.

00:12:12.631 --> 00:12:13.933
NOR IS THIS POLICY OF NOT

00:12:13.999 --> 00:12:15.568
COMMENTING ON PRESIDENT TRUMP'S

00:12:15.634 --> 00:12:17.403
IMMIGRATION POLICIES A PROPOSED

00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:18.671
WALL AFTER CHANGE IN THE NEAR

00:12:18.737 --> 00:12:19.939
FUTURE FOR AT LEAST THREE

00:12:20.005 --> 00:12:20.973
REASONS.

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:23.342
FIRST THE NEW US MCA THE US

00:12:23.409 --> 00:12:26.312
MEXICO CANADA TRADE AGREEMENT.

00:12:26.378 --> 00:12:26.846
BEYOND THE VISIBLE OR NOT

00:12:26.912 --> 00:12:28.247
WANTING PROBLEMS WITH THE UNITED

00:12:28.314 --> 00:12:29.949
STATES IN GENERAL HE UNDERSTANDS

00:12:30.015 --> 00:12:31.484
THE MEXICAN ECONOMY.

00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:33.285
IS RELIANT ON FREE TRADE WITH

00:12:33.352 --> 00:12:34.720
THE UNITED STATES HE JUST NEEDS

00:12:34.787 --> 00:12:36.122
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ON

00:12:36.188 --> 00:12:38.057
MEXICO SIDE IN THE BATTLE FOR

00:12:38.124 --> 00:12:40.326
THE RATIFICATION OF THE US MCA

00:12:40.392 --> 00:12:41.727
IN THE U. S. CONGRESS.

00:12:41.794 --> 00:12:43.562
SECOND ATTITUDES TOWARDS UNITED

00:12:43.629 --> 00:12:45.464
STATES IN MEXICO.

00:12:45.531 --> 00:12:46.999
MEXICANS DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN

00:12:47.066 --> 00:12:48.134
UNITED STATES AND PRESIDENT

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:49.568
TRUMP AND THEIR ATTITUDES BUT

00:12:49.635 --> 00:12:51.537
POLLS ALSO SHOW THAT MEXICANS

00:12:51.604 --> 00:12:53.239
ARE NOT CLAMORING FOR LOPEZ

00:12:53.305 --> 00:12:55.674
OBRADOR TO BACK. TO HIT BACK AT

00:12:55.741 --> 00:12:57.009
TRUMP FOR AS IMMIGRATION

00:12:57.076 --> 00:12:59.545
POLICIES HIS CALL FOR A WALL HIS

00:12:59.612 --> 00:13:01.180
RHETORICAL ATTACKS ON MEXICO

00:13:01.247 --> 00:13:02.681
THIS GIVES LOPEZ OBRADOR A LOT

00:13:02.748 --> 00:13:05.751
OF DOMESTIC FLEXIBILITY TO

00:13:05.818 --> 00:13:07.253
CONTINUE HIS CURRENT POLICY.

00:13:07.319 --> 00:13:08.787
AND THIRD AT THE SAME TIME

00:13:08.854 --> 00:13:10.256
TRUMP'S APPARENT RESPECT FOR

00:13:10.322 --> 00:13:11.857
LOPEZ OBRADOR SEEMS TO

00:13:11.924 --> 00:13:13.392
INFORMACIóN AGENT NOT TO

00:13:13.459 --> 00:13:15.094
CRITICIZE IT MEXICO'S PRESIDENT

00:13:15.161 --> 00:13:17.163
PERSONALLY WHILE HE REGULARLY

00:13:17.229 --> 00:13:18.797
CRITICIZES MEXICO.

00:13:18.864 --> 00:13:21.400
TRUMP HAS YET TO CRITICIZE LOPEZ

00:13:21.467 --> 00:13:22.468
OBRADOR.

00:13:22.535 --> 00:13:23.702
ALL THIS HELPS TO EXPLAIN WHY

00:13:23.769 --> 00:13:25.271
THERE HAS NOT BEEN AND WHY IT'S

00:13:25.337 --> 00:13:27.339
UNLIKELY THERE WILL BE A MAJOR

00:13:27.406 --> 00:13:29.375
CLASH BETWEEN UNITED STATES AND

00:13:29.441 --> 00:13:31.243
MEXICO IN THE COMING MONTHS.

00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:32.945
HOWEVER IT ALSO MEANS THEY'RE

00:13:33.012 --> 00:13:34.246
UNLIKELY TO BE ANY POSITIVE

00:13:34.313 --> 00:13:35.915
INITIATIVES EMANATING FROM

00:13:35.981 --> 00:13:38.117
MEXICO CITY OR WASHINGTON TO

00:13:38.184 --> 00:13:39.585
DEAL WITH ARE SURE CHALLENGES

00:13:39.652 --> 00:13:41.053
AND OPPORTUNITIES.

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:42.655
THAT LEAVES A LOT OF ROOM FOR

00:13:42.721 --> 00:13:44.223
CALIFORNIA TO FILL THE VOID.

00:13:44.290 --> 00:13:45.424
INDEED CALIFORNIA SHOULD TAKE

00:13:45.491 --> 00:13:46.759
THE LEAD ON BUILDING A STRONGER

00:13:46.825 --> 00:13:48.928
BI LATERAL COLLABORATION GIVEN

00:13:48.994 --> 00:13:49.895
HOW MUCH MEXICO MATTERS TO

00:13:49.962 --> 00:13:51.797
CALIFORNIA.

00:13:51.864 --> 00:13:52.898
LET ME OFFER A QUICK REMINDER

00:13:52.965 --> 00:13:54.833
WHICH YOU PROBABLY ALREADY KNOW

00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:56.535
WHICH IS HOW MUCH MEXICO MATTERS.

00:13:56.602 --> 00:13:58.337
TO CALIFORNIA BEYOND MEXICO'S

00:13:58.404 --> 00:13:59.939
OBVIOUS INFLUENCE ON OUR

00:14:00.005 --> 00:14:02.107
DEMOCRACY AND OUR CULTURE MEXICO

00:14:02.174 --> 00:14:03.742
HAS IN STORE NEARLY IMPORTANT TO

00:14:03.809 --> 00:14:05.277
THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY.

00:14:05.344 --> 00:14:07.012
MEXICO'S CALIFORNIA'S NUMBER ONE

00:14:07.079 --> 00:14:08.814
EXPORT MARKET TAKING OVER THIRTY

00:14:08.881 --> 00:14:10.049
BILLION DOLLARS IN CALIFORNIA

00:14:10.115 --> 00:14:11.183
EXPORTS.

00:14:11.250 --> 00:14:13.385
THAT AMOUNTS TO ABOUT 17% OF

00:14:13.452 --> 00:14:14.987
TOTAL EXPORTS THE CALIFORNIA FOR

00:14:15.054 --> 00:14:16.455
CALIFORNIA.

00:14:16.522 --> 00:14:18.824
THAT TRANSLATES TO NEARLY SEVEN

00:14:18.891 --> 00:14:19.325
HUNDRED THOUSAND JOBS IN

00:14:19.391 --> 00:14:20.960
CALIFORNIA.

00:14:21.026 --> 00:14:22.361
MEXICO IS ALSO A NUMBER TO

00:14:22.428 --> 00:14:24.230
SOURCE OF IMPORTED GOODS AND BY

00:14:24.296 --> 00:14:26.031
FAR THE NUMBER ONE ORIGIN

00:14:26.098 --> 00:14:27.566
FOREIGN TRAVELERS TO CALIFORNIA.

00:14:27.633 --> 00:14:29.268
AND MEXICAN COMPANIES OPERATE IN

00:14:29.335 --> 00:14:30.769
CALIFORNIA CREATING THOUSANDS

00:14:30.836 --> 00:14:32.338
MORE JOBS.

00:14:32.404 --> 00:14:34.406
BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY IS THE

00:14:34.473 --> 00:14:36.008
CALIFORNIA'STRADE WITH MEXICO

00:14:36.075 --> 00:14:37.910
ACTUALLY OCCURS WITHIN THE SAME

00:14:37.977 --> 00:14:39.211
CLASSES OF GOODS.

00:14:39.278 --> 00:14:41.180
MACHINERY VEHICLES MEDICAL

00:14:41.247 --> 00:14:42.982
INSTRUMENTS AND ELECTRONICS AND

00:14:43.048 --> 00:14:44.850
ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT WHAT THAT

00:14:44.917 --> 00:14:46.185
MEANS IS WE DON'T JUST TRADE

00:14:46.252 --> 00:14:48.087
WITH ONE ANOTHER WE PRODUCE

00:14:48.153 --> 00:14:49.521
GOODS TOGETHER THROUGH CROSS

00:14:49.588 --> 00:14:50.990
BORDER SUPPLY CHAINS.

00:14:51.056 --> 00:14:52.391
THIS IS PARTICULARLY PRONOUNCED

00:14:52.458 --> 00:14:53.792
FOR COMPANIES IN THE SAN DIEGO

00:14:53.859 --> 00:14:56.262
TO QUAN A REGION WHERE RESEARCH

00:14:56.328 --> 00:14:57.696
DEVELOPMENT AND DESIGN.

00:14:57.763 --> 00:14:59.231
ACTIVITIES TAKE PLACE IN SAN

00:14:59.298 --> 00:15:01.166
DIEGO FOR THE MANUFACTURING

00:15:01.233 --> 00:15:02.034
INCLUDING HIGH TECH

00:15:02.101 --> 00:15:03.802
MANUFACTURING TAKES PLACE IN

00:15:03.869 --> 00:15:05.137
TIJUANA.

00:15:05.204 --> 00:15:06.839
MEXICO THOSE MATTERS ENORMOUSLY

00:15:06.905 --> 00:15:08.607
TO CALIFORNIA.

00:15:08.674 --> 00:15:09.908
SO WHERE THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR

00:15:09.975 --> 00:15:10.909
ENGAGEMENT BETWEEN CALIFORNIA

00:15:10.976 --> 00:15:12.578
MEXICO.

00:15:12.645 --> 00:15:13.846
THERE ARE MULTIPLE BILATERAL

00:15:13.912 --> 00:15:14.647
PROBLEMS AS WELL AS

00:15:14.713 --> 00:15:15.881
OPPORTUNITIES THAT WOULD BENEFIT

00:15:15.948 --> 00:15:17.650
FROM DEEPER COLLABORATION

00:15:17.716 --> 00:15:19.818
BETWEEN CALIFORNIA MEXICO.

00:15:19.885 --> 00:15:21.253
SOME OF THESE INCLUDE MIGRATION

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:22.721
EDUCATION ECONOMY WHICH I'LL

00:15:22.788 --> 00:15:23.989
LEAVE THAT UP TO MY COLLEAGUES

00:15:24.056 --> 00:15:25.524
ON THE PANEL TO DISCUSS TODAY

00:15:25.591 --> 00:15:27.660
I'D LIKE TO FOCUS ON SECURITY

00:15:27.726 --> 00:15:29.395
AND ENERGY ISSUES BRIEFLY.

00:15:29.461 --> 00:15:30.763
BEFORE I TURN TO THESE ISSUES I

00:15:30.829 --> 00:15:32.097
WANT TO EMPHASIZE ABROAD

00:15:32.164 --> 00:15:33.832
OPPORTUNITY FOR CALIFORNIA ON

00:15:33.899 --> 00:15:35.467
THE POLITICAL HORIZON.

00:15:35.534 --> 00:15:37.169
THE STATE OF BAJA CALIFORNIA

00:15:37.236 --> 00:15:38.270
WILL ELECT A NEW GOVERNOR AND A

00:15:38.337 --> 00:15:40.472
NEW LEGISLATURE ON JUNE SECOND.

00:15:40.539 --> 00:15:41.607
THIS GIVES CALIFORNIA THE

00:15:41.674 --> 00:15:43.208
OPPORTUNITY TO QUICKLY

00:15:43.275 --> 00:15:44.977
CONGRATULATE THE VICTOR AND TO

00:15:45.044 --> 00:15:46.211
MAKE IT EARLY OFFER OF BI

00:15:46.278 --> 00:15:47.579
LATERAL COLLABORATION IN THE

00:15:47.646 --> 00:15:48.580
AREAS WITH THE NEW BAJA

00:15:48.647 --> 00:15:50.316
CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT THINKS IT

00:15:50.382 --> 00:15:52.151
WOULD BE BENEFICIAL.

00:15:52.217 --> 00:15:54.887
SO LET ME NOW TURN TO SECURITY.

00:15:54.953 --> 00:15:56.355
MEXICO IS THERE ANYTHING

00:15:56.422 --> 00:15:57.890
SECURITY CRISIS DRIVEN BY THE

00:15:57.956 --> 00:15:59.425
ACTIVITIES OF ORGANIZED CRIME

00:15:59.491 --> 00:16:01.327
AND GANGS WHICH ARE CONCENTRATED

00:16:01.393 --> 00:16:03.095
IN CERTAIN STATES AND CERTAIN

00:16:03.162 --> 00:16:04.330
MUNICIPALITIES.

00:16:04.396 --> 00:16:05.597
ANY HELP UNITED STATES CAN

00:16:05.664 --> 00:16:06.999
PROVIDE MEXICO IN LOWERING WHAT

00:16:07.066 --> 00:16:08.434
IS WHICH IS ONE OF THE HIGHEST

00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:10.336
MURDER RATES IN THE WORLD WOULD

00:16:10.402 --> 00:16:12.137
BE BENEFICIAL OBVIOUSLY IN TERMS

00:16:12.204 --> 00:16:14.173
OF PERSONAL SECURITY IN MEXICO

00:16:14.239 --> 00:16:15.007
HUMAN RIGHTS.

00:16:15.074 --> 00:16:16.842
AND POLITICAL STABILITY AND A

00:16:16.909 --> 00:16:18.610
FRIENDLY NEIGHBORING COUNTRY.

00:16:18.677 --> 00:16:20.479
BUT ENHANCING SECURITY IN MEXICO

00:16:20.546 --> 00:16:21.513
IS ALSO IN THE IMMEDIATE

00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:22.948
INTEREST OF CALIFORNIA.

00:16:23.015 --> 00:16:24.149
THIS IS NOT BECAUSE OF THE

00:16:24.216 --> 00:16:25.417
THREAT OF CRIME SPREADING OVER

00:16:25.484 --> 00:16:26.885
THE BORDER FROM MEXICO INTO

00:16:26.952 --> 00:16:28.220
CALIFORNIA.

00:16:28.287 --> 00:16:29.988
DECADES OF EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT

00:16:30.055 --> 00:16:31.590
THIS RARELY HAPPENS. FOR

00:16:31.657 --> 00:16:33.559
CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA THE MOST

00:16:33.625 --> 00:16:35.594
IMPORTANT IMPACT OF SECURITY IN

00:16:35.661 --> 00:16:37.396
MEXICO IS DEAD IT'S INSTEAD ITS

00:16:37.463 --> 00:16:38.997
ECONOMIC IMPACT.

00:16:39.064 --> 00:16:40.299
IT'S NOT JUST ON THE MEXICAN

00:16:40.366 --> 00:16:42.301
ECONOMY AND THEREFORE US TRADE

00:16:42.368 --> 00:16:43.836
WITH MEXICO BUT GIVEN THE

00:16:43.902 --> 00:16:45.204
INTERDEPENDENCE BETWEEN OUR TWO

00:16:45.270 --> 00:16:47.172
ECONOMIES THE IMPACT IS ON THE

00:16:47.239 --> 00:16:49.541
CALIFORNIA ECONOMY IN CALIFORNIA

00:16:49.608 --> 00:16:51.143
PRODUCTION AS WELL.

00:16:51.210 --> 00:16:52.344
WE KNOW THAT DEALING WITH CRIME

00:16:52.411 --> 00:16:53.579
AND VIOLENCE IN MEXICO'S

00:16:53.645 --> 00:16:55.247
ELSEWHERE ULTIMATELY DEPENDS ON

00:16:55.314 --> 00:16:56.882
THE CAPACITY OF LOCAL POLICE

00:16:56.949 --> 00:16:57.683
FORCES.

00:16:57.750 --> 00:16:59.051
BUT LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT IN

00:16:59.118 --> 00:17:00.819
MEXICO IS IN NEED OF SIGNIFICANT

00:17:00.886 --> 00:17:02.421
IMPROVEMENT.

00:17:02.488 --> 00:17:03.655
AT THE SAME TIME MOST OF

00:17:03.722 --> 00:17:04.990
CALIFORNIA CITIES ARE PATROLLED

00:17:05.057 --> 00:17:06.492
BY HOW WELL TRAINED HIGHLY

00:17:06.558 --> 00:17:08.527
CAPABLE POLICE FORCES MANY OF

00:17:08.594 --> 00:17:09.528
WHICH HAVE HAD SUCCESSFUL

00:17:09.595 --> 00:17:10.896
EXPERIENCES AND FIGHT IN THE

00:17:10.963 --> 00:17:12.598
KIND OF GANG VIOLENCETHAT NOW

00:17:12.664 --> 00:17:13.966
CONFRONTS MEXICAN POLICE.

00:17:14.032 --> 00:17:15.934
CALIFORNIA CAN BRING ITS

00:17:16.001 --> 00:17:17.269
EXPERIENCE TO MEXICO.

00:17:17.336 --> 00:17:18.904
INDEED THE SAN DIEGO POLICE HAVE

00:17:18.971 --> 00:17:20.038
BEEN WORKING WITH THE TO QUAN A

00:17:20.105 --> 00:17:21.907
POLICE TO HELP THEM DEVELOP

00:17:21.974 --> 00:17:23.509
EFFECTIVE COMMUNITY POLICING.

00:17:23.575 --> 00:17:25.210
IN ORDER TO REDUCE VIOLENCE AND

00:17:25.277 --> 00:17:27.112
THE BROADER ACTIVITY OF GANGS

00:17:27.179 --> 00:17:28.714
AND ORGANIZED CRIME.

00:17:28.781 --> 00:17:30.449
THIS KIND OF CLOSE COLLABORATION

00:17:30.516 --> 00:17:32.351
BETWEEN MEXICAN AND I'M

00:17:32.418 --> 00:17:34.086
CALIFORNIAN LOCAL POLICE COULD

00:17:34.153 --> 00:17:35.087
BE EXPANDED TO INCLUDE OTHER

00:17:35.154 --> 00:17:36.922
CALIFORNIA CITIES AND OTHER

00:17:36.989 --> 00:17:39.057
MEXICAN CITIES.

00:17:39.124 --> 00:17:40.492
LET ME TURN NOW TO THE QUESTION

00:17:40.559 --> 00:17:43.262
OF ENERGY -- I BELIEVE THERE'S

00:17:43.328 --> 00:17:44.630
ROOM FOR COLLABORATION IN THE

00:17:44.696 --> 00:17:45.831
AREA OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND

00:17:45.898 --> 00:17:48.066
SPECIFICALLY IN CLEAN ENERGY.

00:17:48.133 --> 00:17:50.169
GENERATION.

00:17:50.235 --> 00:17:51.136
UNLIKE THE PREVIOUS TWO

00:17:51.203 --> 00:17:53.405
ADMINISTRATIONS IN MEXICO CITY

00:17:53.472 --> 00:17:54.873
THE LOCALS OVERLORD MINISTRATION

00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:56.642
IS NOT FOCUSED ON THE ISSUE OF

00:17:56.708 --> 00:17:58.043
CLIMATE CHANGE BUT STATE

00:17:58.110 --> 00:17:59.311
GOVERNMENTS ARE.

00:17:59.378 --> 00:18:01.079
AND THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE IN

00:18:01.146 --> 00:18:02.314
THE NEIGHBORING STATES OF BAJA

00:18:02.381 --> 00:18:04.049
CALIFORNIA AND SONORA WHERE THEY

00:18:04.116 --> 00:18:05.017
WANT TO REDUCE THEIR ARBON

00:18:05.083 --> 00:18:07.319
FOOTPRINT BY INCREASING WIND AND

00:18:07.386 --> 00:18:08.854
SOLAR POWER USAGE.

00:18:08.921 --> 00:18:10.322
CALIFORNIA IS OBVIOUSLY A LEADER

00:18:10.389 --> 00:18:12.090
AND GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE

00:18:12.157 --> 00:18:13.692
INCLUDING THE INTEGRATION OF

00:18:13.759 --> 00:18:15.327
WIND AND SOLAR POWER INTO ITS

00:18:15.394 --> 00:18:17.830
ELECTRICITY GENERATION MATRIX.

00:18:17.896 --> 00:18:19.331

ON THE ROOFTOPS OF BUSINESSES

00:18:30.476 --> 00:18:31.844

00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:09.608
YEARS I LIVED IN SAN DIEGO AND

00:20:09.675 --> 00:20:10.909
TIJUANA FOR MANY YEARS AND FR

00:20:10.976 --> 00:20:12.210
YEARS.

00:20:12.277 --> 00:20:15.814
IF NOT DECADES PEOPLE INCENDIO

00:20:15.881 --> 00:20:16.348
DEBATED WHERE TO PUT A NEW

00:20:16.415 --> 00:20:17.249
AIRPORT.

00:20:17.316 --> 00:20:18.850
THIS WAS A DEBATE THAT RAGED

00:20:18.917 --> 00:20:19.484
BECAUSE YOU KNOW FOR ALL THOSE

00:20:19.551 --> 00:20:20.052
THAT ARE FLOWN INTO THE SAN

00:20:20.118 --> 00:20:21.753
DIEGO AIRPORT IT IS A BEAUTIFUL

00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:22.421
BUT SMALL AIRPORT IN THE MIDDLE

00:20:22.487 --> 00:20:23.221
OF TOWN.

00:20:23.288 --> 00:20:25.257
A EVENTUALLY AFTER MUCH

00:20:25.324 --> 00:20:27.092
DISCUSSION THE ANSWER WAS NOT

00:20:27.159 --> 00:20:29.661
BILLION AIRPORT IN SAN DIEGO IT

00:20:29.728 --> 00:20:30.295
WAS ACTUALLY JOINING FORCES WITH

00:20:30.362 --> 00:20:31.663
THE ONE NEED TO BUILD A BRIDGE

00:20:31.730 --> 00:20:33.565
ACROSS THE BORDER FENCE.

00:20:33.632 --> 00:20:34.266
AND ACTUALLY CONNECT THE TWO

00:20:34.333 --> 00:20:35.734
CITIES ALLOW PEOPLE TO USE

00:20:35.801 --> 00:20:37.436
AIRPORT IS A LARGER AIRPORT

00:20:37.502 --> 00:20:39.171
THAT'S RIGHT ON THE BORDER.

00:20:39.237 --> 00:20:41.340
IN A VERY PRAGMATIC WAY -- ALLOW

00:20:41.406 --> 00:20:42.841
PEOPLE FROM SAN DIEGO ACCESS

00:20:42.908 --> 00:20:44.710
WHAT THE ONE ALREADY HAD AND

00:20:44.776 --> 00:20:48.080
IT'S BEEN IN MANY WAYS A SYMBOL

00:20:48.146 --> 00:20:48.947
FOR WHAT'S IN THE ON THE ONE ARE

00:20:49.014 --> 00:20:49.948
DOING TOGETHER TO CITIES THAT

00:20:50.015 --> 00:20:51.083
HAVE ACTUALLY DISCOVER THAT THEY

00:20:51.149 --> 00:20:52.551
HAVE MORE IN COMMON.

00:20:52.618 --> 00:20:53.585
THAN THEY EVER IMAGINED THE MORE

00:20:53.652 --> 00:20:54.853
COMMON THAN I WOULD HAVE REALIZE

00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:56.254
WHEN I LIVED IN THE REGION THE

00:20:56.321 --> 00:20:57.522
NINETEEN NINETIES I MEAN THIS IS.

00:20:57.589 --> 00:20:59.057
THE ONE AS BEING MORE OF A

00:20:59.124 --> 00:21:00.192
MIDDLE CLASS CITY MORE THAN

00:21:00.258 --> 00:21:02.427
INNOVATIVE CITY AS A SAN DIEGO

00:21:02.494 --> 00:21:03.462
SANDY WAS BECOME A CITY OF

00:21:03.528 --> 00:21:05.497
INNOVATION AS WELL -- AND WITH

00:21:05.564 --> 00:21:07.065
ENORMOUS AS DOCTOR STAR SAID A

00:21:07.132 --> 00:21:08.166
MINUTE AGO WITH ENORMOUS

00:21:08.233 --> 00:21:10.268
COMPLEMENTARITY IS IN TERMS OF

00:21:10.335 --> 00:21:11.970
OF THEIR INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION

00:21:12.037 --> 00:21:14.006
AND THERE ARE DE SO WHAT IS THE

00:21:14.072 --> 00:21:17.009
SAME THINGS THAT ARE PRODUCED IN

00:21:17.075 --> 00:21:17.609
SAN DIEGO ARE PRODUCED IN THE

00:21:17.676 --> 00:21:18.877
ONE A BUT YOU HAVE DIFFERENT

00:21:18.944 --> 00:21:20.078
PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES.

00:21:20.145 --> 00:21:21.980
MAKING THINGS TOGETHER THIS IS

00:21:22.047 --> 00:21:24.316
IN MANY WAYS -- AND AND AND

00:21:24.383 --> 00:21:24.850
PEOPLE'S AND THE ONE IN --

00:21:24.916 --> 00:21:26.485
INCREASINGLY TALK ABOUT A COMMON

00:21:26.551 --> 00:21:28.553
METROPOLITAN AREA -- IT IS

00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:29.988
FASCINATING TO SEE TO CITIES

00:21:30.055 --> 00:21:31.156
THAT I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF IT

00:21:31.223 --> 00:21:32.557
I BROUGHT ABOUT MANY YEARS AGO

00:21:32.624 --> 00:21:34.426
AS BEING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT

00:21:34.493 --> 00:21:35.327
TWENTY OUT TO BE ACTUALLY MUCH

00:21:35.394 --> 00:21:35.927
MORE SIMILAR TO THE ONE THING

00:21:35.994 --> 00:21:38.530
BUT BUT IN SOME WAYS. SEVENTY

00:21:38.597 --> 00:21:40.232
ONE ARE MICROCOSM OF THE BROADER

00:21:40.298 --> 00:21:42.100
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CALIFORNIA.

00:21:42.167 --> 00:21:43.502
IN MEXICO.

00:21:43.568 --> 00:21:44.569
ARM CLOSE TO A THIRD OF

00:21:44.636 --> 00:21:45.904
CALIFORNIANS TRACE THEIR

00:21:45.971 --> 00:21:47.506
RELATIONSHIP THEIR HERITAGE TO

00:21:47.572 --> 00:21:48.607
MEXICO.

00:21:48.674 --> 00:21:50.075
THE STATE DEPENDS ON MEXICO'S

00:21:50.142 --> 00:21:52.044
LARGEST MARKET FOR STATE EXPORTS

00:21:52.110 --> 00:21:53.278
OVER TWENTY FIVE BUT BILLION

00:21:53.345 --> 00:21:54.579
DOLLARS A YEAR.

00:21:54.646 --> 00:22:00.385
THESE ARE STATES ARE

00:22:00.452 --> 00:22:01.486
INEXTRICABLY LINKED.

00:22:01.553 --> 00:22:02.421
AND IF THE BORDER COMMUNITIES

00:22:02.487 --> 00:22:03.021
ARE AT THE FRONT LINES OF THIS

00:22:03.088 --> 00:22:03.522
RELATIONSHIP INDUBITABLY

00:22:03.588 --> 00:22:04.656
INCREASINGLY ALL OF CALIFORNIA'S

00:22:04.723 --> 00:22:05.490
TRULY PART OF THE BORDER TODAY

00:22:05.557 --> 00:22:05.791
[inaudible]

00:22:05.857 --> 00:22:08.593
ARM.

00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:09.861
AND I WOULD ACTUALLY MAKE THIS

00:22:09.928 --> 00:22:10.595
ARGUMENT FOR THE UNITED STATES

00:22:10.662 --> 00:22:12.464
AS A WHOLE MANY INCREASINGLY WE

00:22:12.531 --> 00:22:13.632
ARE SEEING.

00:22:13.699 --> 00:22:14.833
BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND

00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:17.769
MEXICO THE BORDER IS EXPANDING.

00:22:17.836 --> 00:22:19.371
DETROIT IS IN MANY WAYS A BORDER

00:22:19.438 --> 00:22:21.173
CITY TO DETROIT DEPENDS ON BOTH

00:22:21.239 --> 00:22:23.308
CANADA AND MEXICO SAN ANTONIO

00:22:23.375 --> 00:22:24.309
AND DALLAS OR CERTAINLY BORDER

00:22:24.376 --> 00:22:26.044
CITIES LOS ANGELES IS CERTAINLY

00:22:26.111 --> 00:22:26.778
BORDER CITY.

00:22:26.845 --> 00:22:28.280
BUT ONE COULD ARGUE THAT

00:22:28.346 --> 00:22:29.047
SACRAMENTO WAS ALSO BORDERS.

00:22:29.114 --> 00:22:30.282
INCREASINGLY THE BORDERS

00:22:30.348 --> 00:22:31.616
EVERYWHERE BECAUSE OUR ECONOMY

00:22:31.683 --> 00:22:33.051
DEPENDS ON OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH

00:22:33.118 --> 00:22:35.587
MEXICO IN VERY DEEP WAYS.

00:22:35.654 --> 00:22:37.456
ARM IN FACT IN THE FIRST TWO

00:22:37.522 --> 00:22:40.392
MONTHS OF THIS YEAR MEXICO WAS

00:22:40.459 --> 00:22:43.061
AMERICA'S LEADING TRADE PARTNER.

00:22:43.128 --> 00:22:44.262
HAS GENERALLY BEEN OUR THIRD

00:22:44.329 --> 00:22:44.930
TRADE PARTNER SECOND DESTINATION

00:22:44.996 --> 00:22:46.064
FOR EXPORTS BUT THROUGH JANUARY

00:22:46.131 --> 00:22:47.332
FEBRUARY WE HAVEN'T SEEN MARCH

00:22:47.399 --> 00:22:48.967
AND APRIL YET -- MEXICO WAS

00:22:49.034 --> 00:22:50.135
ACTUALLY LEADING TRADE PARTNER

00:22:50.202 --> 00:22:51.369
IN A LOT OF HAS TO DO WITH

00:22:51.436 --> 00:22:51.937
ACTUALLY THE TRADE WAR WITH

00:22:52.003 --> 00:22:52.838
CHINA.

00:22:52.904 --> 00:22:54.372
BUT IT'S ACTUALLY NORMALLY EVEN

00:22:54.439 --> 00:22:55.707
IN A REGULAR MONTH THEY'RE ALL

00:22:55.774 --> 00:22:57.275
VERY CLOSE ACTUALLY MEXICO WAS

00:22:57.342 --> 00:22:59.411
MOVED UP VERY CLOSE TO CANADA

00:22:59.478 --> 00:23:00.112
AND CHINA.

00:23:00.178 --> 00:23:02.047
BUT WHAT WE'VE SEEN.

00:23:02.114 --> 00:23:04.449
TRADING CREASE FIVE TIMES SINCE

00:23:04.516 --> 00:23:05.817
NAFTA WAS IMPLEMENTED A WE'VE

00:23:05.884 --> 00:23:06.718
SEEN CALMER AND WE'VE SEEN THE

00:23:06.785 --> 00:23:07.619
TRANSIT OF PEOPLE ACROSS THE

00:23:07.686 --> 00:23:09.955
BORDER INCREASE EXPONENTIALLY AS

00:23:10.021 --> 00:23:10.889
WELL.

00:23:10.956 --> 00:23:13.024
WE HAVE NOT SEEN THE KIND OF

00:23:13.091 --> 00:23:14.693
FEDERAL INVESTMENTS WE NEED TO

00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:16.161
MAKE SURE THAT OUR BORDER

00:23:16.228 --> 00:23:17.395
FUNCTIONS EFFECTIVELY.

00:23:17.462 --> 00:23:18.730
THAT SO THIS IS WHAT I WANT TO

00:23:18.797 --> 00:23:20.832
TALK ABOUT TODAY.

00:23:20.899 --> 00:23:22.267
ALL AT THE SAME TIME ON

00:23:22.334 --> 00:23:24.636
AUTHORIZED FLOWS AS WE WE HAVE A

00:23:24.703 --> 00:23:26.805
FULL COMMITTEE TODAY AGREED --

00:23:26.872 --> 00:23:27.873
THE CENTER ON AUTHORIZED FLOWS

00:23:27.939 --> 00:23:29.474
HAVE ACTUALLY INCREASED HOW MANY

00:23:29.541 --> 00:23:30.709
OF US HAVE SAID FOR YEARS THAT

00:23:30.776 --> 00:23:32.277
ON AUTHORIZED CLOSE WE'RE GOING

00:23:32.344 --> 00:23:33.912
DOWN IT WAS TRUE -- BUT WE HAVE

00:23:33.979 --> 00:23:35.480
SEEN AN INCREASE IN CENTRAL

00:23:35.547 --> 00:23:37.449
AMERICA NOT MEXICAN FLOWS IN

00:23:37.516 --> 00:23:38.316
RECENT MONTHS AND IT'S

00:23:38.383 --> 00:23:41.787
NOTICEABLE AND I THINK IT MAY BE

00:23:41.853 --> 00:23:42.354
HERE TO STAY FOR A PERIOD OF

00:23:42.420 --> 00:23:44.156
TIME -- AND SO THERE AT LEAST

00:23:44.222 --> 00:23:44.723
THREE CHALLENGES THE REQUIRE

00:23:44.790 --> 00:23:46.958
FEDERAL ACTION.

00:23:47.025 --> 00:23:48.593
AND WITHOUT FEDERAL ACTION LEAVE

00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:49.761
CALIFORNIA IN A DIFFICULT

00:23:49.828 --> 00:23:52.197
SITUATION AS MANY BORDER STATES.

00:23:52.264 --> 00:23:54.466
ARM AND WHICH CALIFORNIA

00:23:54.533 --> 00:23:56.168
CALIFORNIA POLICY MAKERS CAN

00:23:56.234 --> 00:23:57.969
PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN IN

00:23:58.036 --> 00:23:58.870
PUSHING FORWARD.

00:23:58.937 --> 00:24:01.139
ME JUST POINT THESE OUT ONE IS

00:24:01.206 --> 00:24:02.107
INVESTING IN PORTS OF ENTRY AND

00:24:02.174 --> 00:24:03.275
I DON'T SOMETHING YOU'VE WORKED

00:24:03.341 --> 00:24:04.976
ON A GREAT DEAL HERE -- OUR

00:24:05.043 --> 00:24:06.444
PORTS OF ENTRY HAVE NOT KEPT UP

00:24:06.511 --> 00:24:08.280
EITHER IN QUANTITY OR QUALITY

00:24:08.346 --> 00:24:09.881
WITH THE TRAFFIC THAT WE SEE.

00:24:09.948 --> 00:24:10.982
COMING ACROSS PRETTY THE

00:24:11.049 --> 00:24:12.050
COMMERCIAL TRAFFIC AND WE'VE

00:24:12.117 --> 00:24:14.085
ACTUALLY SEEN A REDIRECTION OF

00:24:14.152 --> 00:24:15.787
OF PORT PERSONNEL. TO SUPPORTING

00:24:15.854 --> 00:24:16.855
THE BORDER PATROL WHICH IS

00:24:16.922 --> 00:24:18.223
ACTUALLY SLOW DOWN COMMERCE

00:24:18.290 --> 00:24:20.425
RECENTLY BUT THIS IS A LONG TERM

00:24:20.492 --> 00:24:22.594
ISSUE -- YOU'LL HEAR I BELIEVE

00:24:22.661 --> 00:24:23.562
NEXT ACTUALLY FROM A CUT ABOVE

00:24:23.628 --> 00:24:24.729
THE SO I I WILL STEAL HIS

00:24:24.796 --> 00:24:26.131
THUNDER HE WILL TALK ABOUT THIS.

00:24:26.198 --> 00:24:27.632
BUT THERE IS AN INCREDIBLE

00:24:27.699 --> 00:24:29.534
AMOUNT OF CREATIVITY GOING ON IN

00:24:29.601 --> 00:24:31.369
UNIFIED CARGO PROCESSING WHERE

00:24:31.436 --> 00:24:33.305
WE HAVE U. S. MAX AND INSPECTORS

00:24:33.371 --> 00:24:34.940
COLOCATED TOGETHER TO DO A

00:24:35.006 --> 00:24:36.608
SINGLE INSPECTION INSTEAD OF TWO

00:24:36.675 --> 00:24:37.542
INSPECTIONS.

00:24:37.609 --> 00:24:38.910
PRE INSPECTION BEFORE THINGS GET

00:24:38.977 --> 00:24:40.745
TO THE BORDER HOW DO WE BEGIN TO

00:24:40.812 --> 00:24:43.782
ACTUALLY MONITOR FLOWS ROWS OF

00:24:43.849 --> 00:24:45.717
TRADE AND FLOWS OF PEOPLE RATHER

00:24:45.784 --> 00:24:46.451
THAN TRYING TO STOP PEOPLE THE

00:24:46.518 --> 00:24:47.052
BORDER.

00:24:47.118 --> 00:24:48.720
YES WE STOP EVERYONE OF THE

00:24:48.787 --> 00:24:50.088
BORDER BUT YOU DO A CURSORY

00:24:50.155 --> 00:24:50.689
CHECK AT THE BORDER IF YOU'VE

00:24:50.755 --> 00:24:52.624
ACTUALLY MONITOR THE FLOW BEFORE

00:24:52.691 --> 00:24:55.660
IT GETS TO THE BORDER -- AND YOU

00:24:55.727 --> 00:24:57.095
KNOW PUSHING THE BORDER OUT

00:24:57.162 --> 00:24:58.597
BEYOND THE BORDER ITSELF AND

00:24:58.663 --> 00:25:00.232
THEN USING NEW TECHNOLOGIES TO

00:25:00.298 --> 00:25:01.566
DETECT CONTRABAND BUT ALL OF

00:25:01.633 --> 00:25:02.968
THESE THINGS ARE STILL THEIR

00:25:03.034 --> 00:25:04.002
INFANT STAGE.

00:25:04.069 --> 00:25:06.238
THEY ALL NEED TO BE UP SCALED UP

00:25:06.304 --> 00:25:07.906
SIGNIFICANTLY AND THIS NEEDS

00:25:07.973 --> 00:25:12.177
ACTUALLY FEDERAL INVESTMENT IN

00:25:12.244 --> 00:25:13.078
FEDERAL COMMITMENT.

00:25:13.144 --> 00:25:13.912
SECONDLY MAKING ASYLUM

00:25:13.979 --> 00:25:15.080
PROCESSING MORE EFFICIENT AND

00:25:15.146 --> 00:25:16.181
TIMELY WOULD BE KEY TO DEALING

00:25:16.248 --> 00:25:17.148
WITH WITH THE UNAUTHORIZED FLOWS

00:25:17.215 --> 00:25:17.983
WE'RE SEEING.

00:25:18.049 --> 00:25:19.985
RIGHT NOW IT TAKES BETWEEN TWO

00:25:20.051 --> 00:25:20.652
TO FOUR YEARS TO GET ASYLUM

00:25:20.719 --> 00:25:22.854
HEARING IS ALL ASYLUM CASES GO

00:25:22.921 --> 00:25:24.689
TO THE COURTS THE IMMIGRATION

00:25:24.756 --> 00:25:26.358
COURTS WHICH ARE OVERLOADED.

00:25:26.424 --> 00:25:28.093
THERE IS A ACTUALLY A PRACTICAL

00:25:28.159 --> 00:25:29.661
WAY OF DEALING WITH THIS WHICH

00:25:29.728 --> 00:25:30.528
IS YOU COULD ACTUALLY HAVE

00:25:30.595 --> 00:25:32.497
ASYLUM OFFICERS BY CALLING DORIS

00:25:32.564 --> 00:25:33.565
MEISNER.

00:25:33.632 --> 00:25:34.966
OF FORMER COMMISSIONER MINUSES

00:25:35.033 --> 00:25:36.735
ACTUALLY WORKE ON THIS YOU

00:25:36.801 --> 00:25:38.503
COULD YOU COULD ACTUALLY PUT UP --

00:25:38.570 --> 00:25:40.171
ALLOW ASYLUM OFFICERS TO MAKE

00:25:40.238 --> 00:25:41.840
THE DECISION ON ASYLUM SPEED UP

00:25:41.907 --> 00:25:43.808
PROCESSING TIMES TO MONTHS

00:25:43.875 --> 00:25:45.277
RATHER THAN YEARS.

00:25:45.343 --> 00:25:46.578
I WOULD BE SUNNY MUCH MORE FAIR

00:25:46.645 --> 00:25:47.846
TO PEOPLE THAT ARE FLEEING FROM

00:25:47.913 --> 00:25:48.413
VIOLENCE WERE FLEEING FROM

00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:50.282
PERSECUTION AND AT THE SAME TIME

00:25:50.348 --> 00:25:53.685
WOULD BE A DETERRENT THE PEOPLE

00:25:53.752 --> 00:25:54.819
DID NOT A STRONG CLAIMS.

00:25:54.886 --> 00:25:55.420
I'M AND THE THIRD THING IS WE

00:25:55.487 --> 00:25:56.554
HAVE LOST WHAT HAPPENED IN THE

00:25:56.621 --> 00:25:57.422
PAST WHICH WAS ONGOING

00:25:57.489 --> 00:25:59.691
CONSULTATIONS BETWEEN THE US AND

00:26:01.326 --> 00:26:02.894
BROAD RANGE OF ISSUES.

00:26:02.961 --> 00:26:04.129
AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IT AT

00:26:04.195 --> 00:26:05.730
THE BEST POINTS INCLUDED STATES

00:26:05.797 --> 00:26:08.233

00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:09.935
FROM MIGRATION AND TRADE THE

00:26:10.001 --> 00:26:11.169
PUBLIC SECURITY IN CHAIRED BY

MENTAL CHALLENGES WE USED WE'VE

00:26:13.672 --> 00:26:14.906

00:26:17.809 --> 00:26:19.311
FAIRLY REGULARLY DIFFERENT

00:26:19.377 --> 00:26:21.846
STRUCTURES IN EACH CASE BUT

00:26:21.913 --> 00:26:23.248
THESE SEEM TO HAVE BROKEN DOWN.

00:26:23.315 --> 00:26:24.816
I THINK YOU'LL HEAR FROM MY

00:26:24.883 --> 00:26:25.784
COLLEAGUE DR DR PHIL BUT AS A

00:26:25.850 --> 00:26:27.218

00:26:27.285 --> 00:26:28.053
OPPORTUNITY FOR STATES TO STEP

00:26:28.119 --> 00:26:28.753
IN.

00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:30.188
BUT I THINK PART OF WERE STATES

00:26:30.255 --> 00:26:31.756
NEED TO STEP IT IS ACTUALLY OVER

00:26:31.823 --> 00:26:33.625
TIME WE CONSTRUCTING THE

00:26:33.692 --> 00:26:35.093
ARCHITECTURE OF THE BILATERAL

00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:36.361
RELATIONSHIP BECAUSE WE'VE LOST

00:26:36.428 --> 00:26:37.929
SOME OF THE ARCHITECTURE.

00:26:37.996 --> 00:26:39.397
THAT ADE THINGS FLOW EASILY

00:26:39.464 --> 00:26:40.966
WHEN YOU LOSE THAT ARCHITECTURE

00:26:41.032 --> 00:26:43.268
YOU LOSE THE ABILITY TO RESPOND.

CALIFORNIA HAS DEVELOPED.

01:08:52.561 --> 01:08:54.630
AS ONE OF THE TOP FIVE ECONOMIES

01:08:54.697 --> 01:08:55.531
IN THE WORLD.

01:08:55.598 --> 01:08:56.866
WITH TRADE BETWEEN CALIFORNIA

01:08:56.932 --> 01:08:59.101
MEXICO BI ONE OF THE MAIN

01:08:59.168 --> 01:09:00.769
DRIVING FORCES BEHIND THIS.

01:09:00.836 --> 01:09:02.671
TRADE ACROSS THE BORDER IS ONE

01:09:02.738 --> 01:09:04.240
OF THE MOST FRUITFUL INDUSTRIES

01:09:04.306 --> 01:09:06.876
IN THE BORDER.

01:09:06.942 --> 01:09:08.310
ESTIMATES THE US ECONOMY PUT A

01:09:08.377 --> 01:09:10.279
TRADE ACROSS THE BORDER OVER ONE

01:09:10.346 --> 01:09:11.814
POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS DAY.

01:09:11.881 --> 01:09:13.048
WHICH FROM OUR LOCAL POINT OF

01:09:13.115 --> 01:09:14.283
VIEW CAN BE SEEN WITH

01:09:14.350 --> 01:09:15.851
AGRICULTURE TRADE.

01:09:15.918 --> 01:09:17.753
AND OTHER MANUFACTURING GOODS.

01:09:17.820 --> 01:09:19.121
IN OUR REGION WE SEE THE BORDER

01:09:19.188 --> 01:09:21.056
TRADE HAPPEN ON A DAILY BASIS

01:09:21.123 --> 01:09:22.725
WITH TRANSPORT BY GROUND FREIGHT

01:09:22.791 --> 01:09:24.093
INDUSTRY CROSSING.

01:09:24.159 --> 01:09:25.160
THE BORDER CONTINUOUSLY

01:09:25.227 --> 01:09:27.229
THROUGHOUT THE DAY EVEN OUTSIDE

01:09:27.296 --> 01:09:28.631
MAJOR GOODS TRADES.

01:09:28.697 --> 01:09:30.432
IF YOU WERE ABOUT TO WALK ON

01:09:30.499 --> 01:09:31.166
BOTH SIDES OF THE BORDER YOU

01:09:31.233 --> 01:09:33.035
WOULD SEE OUR SPOT INDIVIDUAL

01:09:33.102 --> 01:09:34.570
PURCHASING GOODS ON BOTH SIDES

01:09:34.637 --> 01:09:35.738
OF THE BORDER.

01:09:35.804 --> 01:09:38.107
AND TRANSPORTING THOSE GOODS OF

01:09:38.173 --> 01:09:39.308
DOUBLE SIDED BORDER WITH A TOM

01:09:39.375 --> 01:09:40.509
FORD WITH SOME VEHICLES.

01:09:40.576 --> 01:09:42.011
ARE THE CALIFORNIA ALSO STANCES

01:09:42.077 --> 01:09:43.345
AND ECONOMIC LEADER.

01:09:43.412 --> 01:09:47.917
BECAUSE OF THE AMOUNTS OF OF

01:09:47.983 --> 01:09:49.351
RICH RESOURCES.

01:09:49.418 --> 01:09:50.286
AND THE INCREASE IN TRADE ACROSS

01:09:50.352 --> 01:09:51.420
THE BORDER BY FACILITATING BY

01:09:51.487 --> 01:09:53.022
MULTIPLE TRADE AGREEMENTS.

01:09:53.088 --> 01:09:54.123
IF NOT FOR THIS TRADE WE WOULD

01:09:54.189 --> 01:09:56.492
BE LESS RICH OF A POSITION THAN

01:09:56.559 --> 01:09:58.360
WE ARE TODAY.

01:09:58.427 --> 01:09:59.728
FROM THE PERSPECTIVE AT THEBORDER.

01:09:59.795 --> 01:10:00.930
THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES FOR

01:10:00.996 --> 01:10:02.531
PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY TO GROW

01:10:02.598 --> 01:10:04.033
BECAUSE WE HAVE A DIVERSE JOB

01:10:04.099 --> 01:10:05.501
OPPORTUNITIES AVAILABLE.

01:10:05.568 --> 01:10:07.069
BECAUSE OF THE TRADE AND

01:10:07.136 --> 01:10:08.504
INNOVATION AND NEW TECHNOLOGIES

01:10:08.571 --> 01:10:10.039
WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A TRADE AND

01:10:10.105 --> 01:10:11.874
SHIPPING POSITIONS THAT HAVE A

01:10:11.941 --> 01:10:13.208
LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY

01:10:13.275 --> 01:10:14.743
TO SUPPORT THEIR FAMILIES.

01:10:14.810 --> 01:10:16.245
AND GROW WITH THE REGION.

01:10:16.312 --> 01:10:17.846
WE HAVE ALSO SEEN INVESTMENT IN

01:10:17.913 --> 01:10:19.481
NEW TECHNOLOGIES WHERE BARREN

01:10:19.548 --> 01:10:21.350
LANDS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED TO

01:10:21.417 --> 01:10:22.851
SOLAR FARMS IN GREEN ENERGY

01:10:22.918 --> 01:10:25.354
INDUSTRIES.

01:10:25.421 --> 01:10:27.222
WHY THERE HAVE BEEN?

01:10:27.289 --> 01:10:28.958
ALWAYS A DESTRUCTIVE AMONG

01:10:29.024 --> 01:10:30.359
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITIES.

01:10:30.426 --> 01:10:31.660
WHEN IT COMES TO FINANCIAL

01:10:31.727 --> 01:10:33.562
MATTERS IN SOME SECTORS?

01:10:33.629 --> 01:10:35.631
THIS IS TRUSTS IT'S NOT ON IS IS

01:10:35.698 --> 01:10:37.766
NOT NOT UNKNOWN TO US LIVING AT

01:10:37.833 --> 01:10:38.467
THE BORDER.

01:10:38.534 --> 01:10:39.969
WALL THE QUESTION AGAINST CROSS

01:10:40.035 --> 01:10:42.571
BORDER WORK AND TRADE IS ALWAYS

01:10:42.638 --> 01:10:44.273
WHERE TO DOLLARS AND UP.

01:10:44.340 --> 01:10:45.941
BUT WHILE THIS MAY BE A NATIONAL

01:10:46.008 --> 01:10:47.643
ARGUMENT WE FIRSTHAND SEE THAT

01:10:47.710 --> 01:10:49.411
THE DOLLARS ARE SPENT ON BOTH

01:10:49.478 --> 01:10:50.879
SIDES OF THE BORDER AND ARE

01:10:50.946 --> 01:10:52.514
SPENT IN PROJECTS FOR EXAMPLE

01:10:52.581 --> 01:10:53.983
JUST IN THE IN THE RIVER FOR

01:10:54.049 --> 01:10:55.417
EXAMPLE THERE WAS.

01:10:55.484 --> 01:10:56.018
OVER A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS

01:10:56.085 --> 01:10:57.486
ABOUT TWENTY OF THOSE MILLION

01:10:57.553 --> 01:10:58.554
DOLLARS WERE SPENT.

01:10:58.621 --> 01:11:00.556
ON THE MEXICO SIDE AND OTHERS A

01:11:00.623 --> 01:11:02.391
CONTRIBUTED FROM CALIFORNIA.

01:11:02.458 --> 01:11:06.328
YET IT'S STILL THE REMAINS ABOUT

01:11:06.395 --> 01:11:07.096
EIGHTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS JUST

01:11:07.162 --> 01:11:07.796
TO SOLVE THAT PROBLEM.

01:11:07.863 --> 01:11:09.231
WELL CALIFORNIA AIMS TO CONTINUE

01:11:09.298 --> 01:11:10.833
TO GROW AND MAINTAIN AN EVER

01:11:10.899 --> 01:11:12.334
INCREASING ECONOMY.

01:11:12.401 --> 01:11:14.269
WE SHOULD BE AWARE THAT.

01:11:14.336 --> 01:11:16.105
THERE IS A PRICE TO PAY WE

01:11:16.171 --> 01:11:17.172
SHOULD NEVER DISREGARD OUR

01:11:17.239 --> 01:11:19.842
ENVIRONMENT AND SOCIAL

01:11:19.908 --> 01:11:20.609
RESPONSIBILITIES.

01:11:20.676 --> 01:11:22.011
THIS IS WHY WE BELIEVE THAT

01:11:22.077 --> 01:11:23.512
ESTABLISH AN INCREASING PRESENCE

01:11:23.579 --> 01:11:24.813
IN OVERSIGHT OVER THE BORDER

01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:27.349
REGION IS AN IMPORTANT MECHANISM.

01:11:27.416 --> 01:11:29.184
WE ARE AT THE BELIEVE THAT THE

01:11:29.251 --> 01:11:30.919
BORDER UNIT A BORDER UNIT FROM

01:11:30.986 --> 01:11:33.188
THE STATE TO PROVIDE OVERSIGHT

01:11:33.255 --> 01:11:35.391
GUIDANCE ENFORCEMENT WILL BE AN

01:11:35.457 --> 01:11:37.526
IMPORTANT FACTOR MOVING FORWARD.

01:11:37.593 --> 01:11:38.894
WITH OUR BI NATIONAL-RELATIONSHIP.

01:11:38.961 --> 01:11:40.963
WHILE NOT ALL WELCOME SUCH AN

01:11:41.030 --> 01:11:43.032

01:11:43.098 --> 01:11:45.167
NEW AVENUES TO MAKE CALIFORNIA

01:11:45.234 --> 01:11:47.503
MEXICO AN EXAMPLE OF A HEALTHY

01:11:47.569 --> 01:11:50.806
AND SOCIALLY CONSCIENCE ECONOMY.

01:11:50.873 --> 01:11:52.374
GROWING A BI NATIONAL ECONOMY.

01:11:52.441 --> 01:11:53.909

01:11:55.844 --> 01:11:57.613
BURDENS THE NEW RIVER WHICH

01:11:57.680 --> 01:11:59.548
TRAVELS NORTH AT A RATE OF TWO

01:11:59.615 --> 01:12:00.549
FEET PER SECOND.

01:12:00.616 --> 01:12:03.118
IT MAKES THE GALLEY TO CALEXICO

01:12:03.185 --> 01:12:04.319
FROM MEXICO TO CALEXICO BRINGING

01:12:04.386 --> 01:12:05.587
WASTE WATER INTO THE US

01:12:05.654 --> 01:12:07.656
REPRESENTS A MAJOR ENVIRONMENTAL

01:12:07.723 --> 01:12:09.391
CONCERN AT THE BORDER.

01:12:09.458 --> 01:12:09.992

01:12:10.993 --> 01:12:13.095
YOU KNOW WHEN WE HEAR THE

WHICH IS A REALITY YOU KNOW

01:12:16.031 --> 01:12:17.733
THERE IS A LEGAL AND ILLICIT

01:12:17.800 --> 01:12:19.902

01:12:19.968 --> 01:12:22.071
IT'S DRUGS WE UNDERSTAND THAT'S

01:12:22.137 --> 01:12:24.239
A PROBLEM BUT THE NEW RIVER

01:12:24.306 --> 01:12:26.308
TRANSPORTS AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF

01:12:26.375 --> 01:12:28.911
THE ILLEGAL IMPORTATION OF

IGNORED AS THOUGH.

01:12:33.649 --> 01:12:38.620
IT'S OKAY TO TURN A BLIND EYE ON

01:12:50.766 --> 01:12:51.233
EXTENDS FROM THE COACHELLA

01:12:52.334 --> 01:12:53.535

01:12:56.972 --> 01:12:58.640
WE SHARE THE AIR BASE IN AND WE

01:12:58.707 --> 01:13:00.676
SHARE THE AIR BEING THE LARGEST

HIGHER SALINITY.

01:13:03.545 --> 01:13:05.214
THEN THE OCEAN.

THIS HAS ALSO SERVED AS A SOME

AN IMPACT IN THE REGION AS A

01:15:16.144 --> 01:15:19.615

01:15:39.401 --> 01:15:40.168
IN THE BORDER REGION.

01:15:40.235 --> 01:15:43.839
pTWO THOUSANDS WE DID A SURVEY

01:15:43.906 --> 01:15:45.307
OUT THERE IN MAY HE KILEY WAS

01:15:45.374 --> 01:15:46.675

FINALLY -- THE STATE GOVERNMENT

NEEDS TO CREATE MORE OFFICES TO

01:16:45.267 --> 01:16:46.735
MOVE THOSE EXISTING.

01:16:46.802 --> 01:16:48.704
AND MOVE THOSE EXISTING OFFICES

01:16:48.770 --> 01:16:50.105

OF THE FEDERAL ADVISORY OARD

01:16:59.348 --> 01:17:00.315

WITH A LOT OF THIS PLANNING AND

01:17:03.285 --> 01:17:04.319
AND AND A LOT OF THE

01:17:04.386 --> 01:17:06.321
RECOMMENDATION I BE PUT NOT ONLY

01:17:06.388 --> 01:17:08.090
BY MYSELF BUT BUT MANY EXPERTS --

01:17:08.156 --> 01:17:09.691
THROUGHOUT THE YEARS AND AND YOU

01:17:09.758 --> 01:17:10.625
KNOW YOU CAN LOOK AT THOSE YOU

01:17:10.692 --> 01:17:13.161
CAN LOOK UP OR TWENTY TWENTY OR

01:17:13.228 --> 01:17:13.862
TWENTY TWELVE THE BI NATIONAL

01:17:13.929 --> 01:17:15.797
TASK FORCES I HAVE BEEN PART OF

01:17:15.864 --> 01:17:17.099
THAT FOR THE LAST TWENTY YEARS.

01:17:17.165 --> 01:17:18.533
AND IT SEEMS LIKE EVERY TIME

01:17:18.600 --> 01:17:20.002
GOVERNMENT IS GIVING AND I'M

01:17:20.068 --> 01:17:21.336
TALKING ABOUT CALIFORNIA.

01:17:21.403 --> 01:17:22.704
EVERY TIME CALIFORNIA'S GIVEN

01:17:22.771 --> 01:17:24.639
DIRECTION TO PUT A PLAN TOGETHER

01:17:24.706 --> 01:17:26.441
IT'S ALWAYS SORT OF A COPY PASTE

01:17:26.508 --> 01:17:28.143
I REVISITED THE SAME THING I

01:17:28.210 --> 01:17:30.212
THINK MEXICO AND HOW CALIFORNIA.

01:17:30.278 --> 01:17:33.215
IS IS IN A A YOU KNOW THEIR IN A

01:17:33.281 --> 01:17:34.316
DIFFERENT POSITION THAT THEY

01:17:34.383 --> 01:17:35.617
MIGHT HAVE BEEN BEFORE I THINK

01:17:35.684 --> 01:17:36.785
THERE'S A LOT MORE MOMENTUM

01:17:36.852 --> 01:17:38.286
THERE'S A LOT OF PROFESSIONALS.

01:17:38.353 --> 01:17:39.755
IN AREAS LIKE THE BORDER IT IN I

01:17:39.821 --> 01:17:41.323
CAN SAY MORE PROBABLY MORE

01:17:41.390 --> 01:17:43.392
DEFINITELY THE FINE AND IMPERIAL

01:17:43.458 --> 01:17:44.926
MEXICALI AND I'M PRETTY SURE

01:17:44.993 --> 01:17:45.127
THIS.

01:17:45.193 --> 01:17:47.162
AND SAN DIEGO A LOT OF WE DROP A

01:17:47.229 --> 01:17:48.230
LOT OF PROFESSIONS MONEY GUY

01:17:48.296 --> 01:17:49.498
BECAUSE THEY HAVE PUT THE EFFORT

01:17:49.564 --> 01:17:51.500
IN AN EMPHASIS ON CREATING A AN

01:17:51.566 --> 01:17:53.101
EDUCATED POPULATION.

01:17:53.168 --> 01:17:54.369
SO WE HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER TO

01:17:54.436 --> 01:17:55.804
BE ABLE TO CREATE SOLUTIONS

01:17:55.871 --> 01:17:57.539
TOGETHER THERE ARE RESOURCES IN

01:17:57.606 --> 01:17:59.274
CALIFORNIA THERE'S EXPERTS IN

01:17:59.341 --> 01:18:00.876
MAY HE KILEY AND I THINK THAT

01:18:00.942 --> 01:18:02.244
THE NEW ADMINISTRATION RIGHT NOW

01:18:02.310 --> 01:18:03.578
ON BOTH SIDES WHETHER IT'S

01:18:03.645 --> 01:18:04.546
CALIFORNIA.

01:18:04.613 --> 01:18:06.648
OR OR MAY HE GO A REALLY

01:18:06.715 --> 01:18:08.517
CONDUCIVE TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT

01:18:08.583 --> 01:18:10.385
I WOULD HOPE THAT THROUGH THIS

01:18:10.452 --> 01:18:13.889
HEARING THAT THERE IS A A PLAN.

01:18:13.955 --> 01:18:15.891

01:18:15.957 --> 01:18:17.225
TO MODERNIZE THE WAY WE DO

01:18:17.292 --> 01:18:20.062
BUSINESS -- INTO MY THAT POINTS

01:18:20.128 --> 01:18:21.229
REAL QUICK IS THAT THE AIR

01:18:30.005 --> 01:18:31.506
APPROVED THE CREATION OF A

01:18:31.573 --> 01:18:32.774
BORDER PROGRAM -- AND AND THAT

01:18:32.841 --> 01:18:33.742
WAS AS A RESULT OF BECAUSE THEY

01:18:33.809 --> 01:18:34.743
HAD PREVIOUSLY HAD -- DEPLOYED

01:18:34.810 --> 01:18:36.311
SOME OF THEIR STAFF THEY DID

01:18:36.378 --> 01:18:38.280
BUSINESS AS USUAL THEY LISTEN TO

01:18:38.346 --> 01:18:40.382

AGREE WE GOT TO DO THINGS

01:18:41.349 --> 01:18:42.350
DIFFERENTLY THERE'S A NEW

01:18:42.417 --> 01:18:43.919

01:40:27.020 --> 01:40:28.021
FAR MORE.

IN COMMON WITH MEXICO THAN WE

01:40:30.391 --> 01:40:32.459
HAVE DIFFERENCES AND I THINK

01:40:32.526 --> 01:40:34.628
IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT WE AS

01:40:34.695 --> 01:40:36.864
CALIFORNIANS SHOW THE LEAD AS IT

01:40:36.930 --> 01:40:38.365
RELATES TO THE ECONOMY AND THE

01:40:38.432 --> 01:40:40.033
ENVIRONMENT.

01:40:40.100 --> 01:40:41.869
AND ABD AND SHOW WHAT DIRECT

01:40:41.935 --> 01:40:43.637
IMPACT IT HAS ON BOTH COUNTRIES

01:40:43.704 --> 01:40:46.073

01:40:46.140 --> 01:40:48.642
COUNTRY -- DESPITE MUCH OF OUR

01:40:48.709 --> 01:40:50.511
DIFFERENCES WE HAVE BEEN --

01:40:50.577 --> 01:40:52.146
INTERDEPENDENCY THAT'S FAR

01:40:52.212 --> 01:40:53.547
BEYOND JUST.

01:40:53.614 --> 01:40:55.449
THE PEOPLE THAT CROSS THE BORDER

01:40:55.516 --> 01:40:57.050

01:40:58.786 --> 01:41:00.788

REACTION THERE SEEMS TO BE A

01:41:55.609 --> 01:41:57.644
CERTAIN COMING TO TERMS MAYBE

01:41:57.711 --> 01:41:59.213

AB I LOVE TO GET SOME INSIGHTS

01:42:02.182 --> 01:42:02.816
INTO THE CURRENT POLITICAL

01:42:02.883 --> 01:42:04.685
CLIMATE AS IT RELATES TO THE

01:42:04.751 --> 01:42:06.453
TRUMP PRESIDENCY HOW HE'S VIEWED

01:42:06.520 --> 01:42:08.655
HOW THE HOW HOW THINGS HAVE

01:42:08.722 --> 01:42:10.257
EVOLVED OVER THE LAST COUPLE

01:42:10.324 --> 01:42:12.726
YEARS -- AND AND HOW THAT'S MAY

01:42:12.793 --> 01:42:13.727
BE REFLECTED BY THE ELECTION

01:42:13.794 --> 01:42:15.562
RESULTS BUT I I KNOW OUR EXPERTS

01:42:15.629 --> 01:42:16.830
ARE HERE LET ME START MADE SOME

01:42:16.897 --> 01:42:18.332
COMMENTS REGARDING THAT I THINK

01:42:18.398 --> 01:42:18.932
THEY WERE THEY WERE GOOD IN

01:42:18.999 --> 01:42:20.667
TERMS OF HER ANALYSIS OF

01:42:20.734 --> 01:42:22.436
MEXICO'S POLITICAL POSITIONS

01:42:22.503 --> 01:42:25.005
WITH THIS ADMINISTRATION BUT IF

01:42:25.072 --> 01:42:27.040
YOU WANT EXPAND.

01:42:27.107 --> 01:42:28.275
COM UM I MEAN PUBLIC OPINION OF

01:42:28.342 --> 01:42:30.377
OF OF OF OF TRUMP IN MEXICO IS

01:42:30.444 --> 01:42:32.312
EXTREMELY POOR I DON'T HAVE THE

01:42:32.379 --> 01:42:33.680
NUMBERS IN FRONT OF ME.

01:42:33.747 --> 01:42:35.382
BUT I WAS A POSITIVE OPINION OF

01:42:35.449 --> 01:42:37.317
HIM IS PROBABLY IN SINGLE DIGITS --

01:42:37.384 --> 01:42:38.919
BUT AS I SAID IN MY COMMENTS

01:42:38.986 --> 01:42:40.687
MEXICAN SEPARATE OUT THEIR

01:42:40.754 --> 01:42:42.422
ATTITUDES TOWARD PRESIDENT TRUMP

01:42:42.489 --> 01:42:43.557
FROM THEIR ATTITUDES TOWARDS

01:42:43.624 --> 01:42:44.858
UNITED STATES.

01:42:44.925 --> 01:42:46.260
SENATORS TOWARDS UNITED STATES

01:42:46.326 --> 01:42:47.694
ACTUALLY STILL QUITE STRONG.

01:42:47.761 --> 01:42:49.229
I'M IN THERE STILL IS A STRONG --

01:42:49.296 --> 01:42:50.931
SUPPORT FOR THE NORTH AMERICAN

01:42:50.998 --> 01:42:51.899
FREE TRADE AGREEMENT.

01:42:51.965 --> 01:42:54.001
AND THEIR STRONG SUPPORT FOR

01:42:54.067 --> 01:42:55.168
AWHILE WILL MEXICANS ARE VERY

01:42:55.235 --> 01:42:56.770
CRITICAL OF PRESIDENT BEEN AND

01:42:56.837 --> 01:42:58.939
YET THE FOR NOT RESPONDING. TO

01:42:59.006 --> 01:43:01.241
TRUMP'S PROVOCATIONS THEY SEEM

01:43:01.308 --> 01:43:04.244
TO HAVE TURNED -- THEIR ATTITUDE

01:43:04.311 --> 01:43:06.213
SIGNIFICANTLY AT OUR BACKING

01:43:06.280 --> 01:43:08.181
LOPEZ OBRADOR'S STRATEGY OF

01:43:08.248 --> 01:43:09.850
SIMPLY NOT RESPONDING -- THERE

01:43:09.917 --> 01:43:11.518
SEEMS TO BE THIS THE GENERAL

01:43:11.585 --> 01:43:14.121
ATTITUDE THAT -- IF YOU NOTICE

01:43:14.187 --> 01:43:14.888
WANTS TO BUILD A WALL WHATEVER

01:43:14.955 --> 01:43:15.689
BUILD A WALL.

01:43:15.756 --> 01:43:20.861
OF BOUGHT -- WHAT IS THE BEST

01:43:20.928 --> 01:43:22.095
WAY TO OF THEM TO DEAL WITH

01:43:22.162 --> 01:43:23.997
UNITED STATES IS TO NOT CONFRONT

01:43:24.064 --> 01:43:25.098
PROP TRUMP AND NOT BECAUSE

01:43:25.165 --> 01:43:26.333
ADDITIONAL PROBLEMS WITH THEM

01:43:26.400 --> 01:43:27.234
BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT THE

01:43:27.301 --> 01:43:28.468
NEXT WEEK IT'S GOING TO BE? ONE

01:43:28.535 --> 01:43:29.903
TWEET AS I LEFT MEXICO ON THE

01:43:29.970 --> 01:43:31.772
NEXT STREET IS MEXICO'S THE

01:43:31.838 --> 01:43:33.206
CAUSE OF ALL OF OUR PROBLEMS.

01:43:33.273 --> 01:43:34.374
SO IN GENERAL THERE'S IS AS

01:43:34.441 --> 01:43:37.110
BROAD ATTITUDE OF JUST NOT

01:43:37.177 --> 01:43:38.979
DEALING WITH HIM AND LETTING HIM

01:43:39.046 --> 01:43:41.248
THEIR SPIN HIMSELF.

01:43:41.315 --> 01:43:42.883
ALLEN ANY IN IS THAT THAT'S SORT

01:43:42.950 --> 01:43:44.117
OF THAT THAT THERE IS THAT'S AN

01:43:44.184 --> 01:43:45.319
EVOLUTION OF SORTS FROM THE

01:43:45.385 --> 01:43:46.853
BEGINNING FROM FOR WHEN HE WAS

01:43:46.920 --> 01:43:48.021
FIRST ELECTED.

01:43:48.088 --> 01:43:50.157
WHEN TROUBLES A SELECTION YEAH

01:43:50.223 --> 01:43:51.959
OF THERE WAS A LOT OF CRITICISM

01:43:52.025 --> 01:43:53.493
OF PRESIDENT BEEN AND YET THE

01:43:53.560 --> 01:43:54.728
FOR NOT STANDING UP MORE

01:43:54.795 --> 01:43:56.463
STRONGLY TO TRUMP?

01:43:56.530 --> 01:43:57.531
AND THERE WAS A BELIEF THAT

01:43:57.598 --> 01:43:59.232
LOPEZ OBRADOR WAS ACTUALLY GOING

01:43:59.299 --> 01:44:01.201
TO BE MORE FORCEFUL ANY ACTUALLY

01:44:01.268 --> 01:44:02.603
PUBLISHED A BOOK DURING THE

01:44:02.669 --> 01:44:04.371
CAMPAIGN CALLED OR YET TRUMP.

01:44:04.438 --> 01:44:07.574
AND WHICH HE CRITICIZED US

01:44:07.641 --> 01:44:09.176
POLICY AGGRESSIVELY AND THERE

01:44:09.242 --> 01:44:09.977
WAS THE ASSUMPTION THAT THERE

01:44:10.043 --> 01:44:11.745
WAS GOING TO BE A LARGE CLASH

01:44:11.812 --> 01:44:13.747
BETWEEN THE TWO OF THEM -- BUT

01:44:13.814 --> 01:44:15.215
WHEN LOCUSTS OVER THE WAR HAD TO

01:44:15.282 --> 01:44:16.883
DECIDE DID HE WANT TO SPEND HIS

01:44:16.950 --> 01:44:18.986
TIME CONFRONTING UNITED STATES

01:44:19.052 --> 01:44:20.854
OR CONFRONTING THE ECONOMIC

01:44:20.921 --> 01:44:22.623
PROBLEMS THAT HE SEES IN MEXICO

01:44:22.689 --> 01:44:23.957
HE CHOSE THE LATTER.

01:44:24.024 --> 01:44:24.891
AND I THINK PART OF IT IS

01:44:24.958 --> 01:44:27.160
BECAUSE HE'S SO DARN POPULAR HIS.

01:44:27.227 --> 01:44:28.562
HIS APPROVAL RATINGS ARE IN THE

01:44:28.629 --> 01:44:30.497
MID SEVENTIES -- THAT THE

01:44:30.564 --> 01:44:32.032
POPULATION IS GIVING HIM THE

01:44:32.099 --> 01:44:34.034
BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT BACKING HIM

01:44:34.101 --> 01:44:35.969
ON THIS POLICY ERIDGE NOW WE ARE

01:44:36.036 --> 01:44:36.837
WE ACTUALLY WANT A LISTING US

01:44:36.903 --> 01:44:38.505
RIGHT AFTER THE TRUMP MEETING

01:44:38.572 --> 01:44:40.173
AND WE HAD A CHANCE TO TALK.

01:44:40.240 --> 01:44:42.442
TO AND PRESIDENT BEING AT ABOUT

01:44:42.509 --> 01:44:43.076
IT WAS VERY INTERESTING READING

01:44:43.143 --> 01:44:43.744
ON'T.

01:44:43.810 --> 01:44:44.611
YOUR OTHER QUESTION WANT TO ASK

01:44:44.678 --> 01:44:49.316
YOU THERE'S BEEN AT AS WAS

01:44:49.383 --> 01:44:51.618
MENTIONED A KIND OF A EARTHQUAKE

01:44:51.685 --> 01:44:52.386
ELECTORALLY.

01:44:52.452 --> 01:44:53.020
IN A SIMILAR TO WHAT WE'VE SEEN

01:44:53.086 --> 01:44:53.620
WHEN FRANCE AND AND A COUPLE

01:44:53.687 --> 01:44:55.122
OTHER PLACES WHERE THE

01:44:55.188 --> 01:44:56.957
TRADITIONAL PARTY STRUCTURE HAS

01:44:57.024 --> 01:44:59.526
RUPTURED -- YOU HAVE THIS.

01:44:59.593 --> 01:45:01.795
YEAH BRAND NEW PARTY THAT IS

01:45:01.862 --> 01:45:02.829
SEEMINGLY COME OUT OF NOWHERE

01:45:02.896 --> 01:45:03.997
VERY CLOSE ASSOCIATE WITH THIS

01:45:04.064 --> 01:45:05.432
ONE PERSON.

01:45:05.499 --> 01:45:06.933
I'M CAN YOU CAN YOU GIVE US SOME

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:08.301
INSIGHTS AS TO HOW WE SHOULD BE

01:45:08.368 --> 01:45:09.803
LOOKING AT THE POLITICAL SCENE

01:45:09.870 --> 01:45:10.971
IN MEXICO RIGHT NOW IN THE WAKE

01:45:11.038 --> 01:45:12.239
OF THE ELECTIONS AND

01:45:12.305 --> 01:45:13.840
UNDERSTANDING THOSE RESULTS.

01:45:13.907 --> 01:45:15.976
SURE I MEAN THE THE RESULTS

01:45:16.043 --> 01:45:18.578
THEMSELVES A REFLECTION OF THE

01:45:18.645 --> 01:45:20.814
DISSATISFACTION THAT MEXICO'S

01:45:20.881 --> 01:45:22.049
FELT TOWARD TRADITIONAL

01:45:22.115 --> 01:45:23.316
POLITICAL PARTIES.

01:45:23.383 --> 01:45:25.085
WHAT'S INTERESTING IS THAT --

01:45:25.152 --> 01:45:27.487
LOCUS OF A LOWER DID NOT CHANGE

01:45:27.554 --> 01:45:29.389
HIS OPINIONS AND THE MULTIPLE

01:45:29.456 --> 01:45:31.191
TIMES THAT HE RUN FOR PRESIDENT

01:45:31.258 --> 01:45:32.893
WHAT CHANGED WAS PUBLIC OPINION

01:45:32.959 --> 01:45:35.095
ATTITUDES TOWARD THE OPPOSITION

01:45:35.162 --> 01:45:36.263
AND THEREFORE TOWARD HIM.

01:45:36.329 --> 01:45:38.665
AND WE GOT TO ELECTION IN TWO

01:45:38.732 --> 01:45:41.435
TWENTY SIX IN IN IN IN IN --

01:45:41.501 --> 01:45:42.035
TWENTY EIGHTEEN AGAIN MY YEARS

01:45:42.102 --> 01:45:44.938
RIGHT -- THAT -- LEVELS OF A

01:45:45.005 --> 01:45:48.709
LOWER WAS SEEN AS THE BEST

01:45:48.775 --> 01:45:50.243
OPTION AVAILABLE WE TRIED TO PUT

01:45:50.310 --> 01:45:52.345
THE THE BOND FOR FOR TWELVE

01:45:52.412 --> 01:45:52.979
YEARS.

01:45:53.046 --> 01:45:54.481
AND THEY HAD NO PROOF THING

01:45:54.548 --> 01:45:55.882
SIGNIFICANTLY INDEED THINGS THAT

01:45:55.949 --> 01:45:57.184
WE ECONOMY SEEM TO BE QUITE

01:45:57.250 --> 01:45:58.919
STAGNANT.

01:45:58.985 --> 01:46:00.187
WITHIN TRY THE PREVIEW PROMISED

01:46:00.253 --> 01:46:01.321
A INCREASE GROWTH IN WHAT THEY

01:46:01.388 --> 01:46:03.190
GAVE US WAS A DRAMATIC INCREASE

01:46:03.256 --> 01:46:03.990
IN CORRUPTION AND NO INCREASE IN

01:46:04.057 --> 01:46:06.359
GROWTH -- AND AND IN BOTH CASES

01:46:06.426 --> 01:46:07.794
SECURITY KEPT GETTING WORSE AND

01:46:07.861 --> 01:46:10.731
WORSE AND WORSE SO WHY NOT TRY

01:46:10.797 --> 01:46:11.331
THE OTHER OPTION WE HAVEN'T

01:46:11.398 --> 01:46:13.233
TRIED -- IN THERE WAS A LOT OF

01:46:13.300 --> 01:46:16.970
OF OF ABOUT 20% OF THE VOTE FOR

01:46:17.037 --> 01:46:18.739
OF VOTERS IN MEXICO WHICH IS.

01:46:18.805 --> 01:46:19.606
I'VE MOVED UP SOME OF THE OR

01:46:19.673 --> 01:46:22.576
FROM 3250% OF THE ELECTRICITY 3%

01:46:22.642 --> 01:46:24.878
HE WON SORT OF WERE IN THAT

01:46:24.945 --> 01:46:27.080
POSITIONOF WE'RE SO DISGUSTED

01:46:27.147 --> 01:46:28.882
WITH THE OTHER TWO PARTIES THAT

01:46:28.949 --> 01:46:30.617
WE'RE GONNA GIVE HIM A TRY YEAH --

01:46:30.684 --> 01:46:32.185
AND THE OTHER TWO PARTIES HAVE

01:46:32.252 --> 01:46:33.920
IMPLODED TO A CERTAIN TO TRIP

01:46:33.987 --> 01:46:35.789
PORTENT AGREE THERE ARE THERE

01:46:35.856 --> 01:46:36.723
ARE THE PRE AND THE AND THE PIER

01:46:36.790 --> 01:46:38.291
DEAR SHADOWS OF WHICH THEY ONCE

THIS MY FIRST TIME HERE AT THE

01:55:23.816 --> 01:55:24.017
CAPITOL.

I VISITED SACRAMENTO BEFORE BUT

01:55:25.985 --> 01:55:26.753
NOT THE CAPITAL AND ACTUALLY

01:55:26.819 --> 01:55:28.221
WANTED TO ADD A LITTLE TO THE

01:55:28.288 --> 01:55:30.023
CONVERSATION I FOUND THIS --

01:55:30.089 --> 01:55:31.991
MEETING TODAY EXTREMELY -- LET

01:55:32.058 --> 01:55:32.792

01:55:36.663 --> 01:55:38.097
BEEN A BUSINESS WOMAN THERE. FOR

OVER THIRTY TWO YEARS BUT I

01:55:40.867 --> 01:55:42.435

VETERAN.

01:55:46.272 --> 01:55:47.640
AND THE REASON I THINK I WANTED

01:55:47.707 --> 01:55:48.441
TO SPEAK TODAY WAS BECAUSE I

01:55:48.508 --> 01:55:49.909

LATELY CNN HAS BEEN VISITING IS

01:55:57.450 --> 01:55:58.918

01:55:59.752 --> 01:56:01.220
AND DONE IT WAS EXTREMELY

01:56:01.287 --> 01:56:03.256
EXCRUCIATING THESE FRUSTRATING

01:56:03.323 --> 01:56:05.325
TO SEE WHAT IT IS THAT HAPPENED --

01:56:05.391 --> 01:56:10.330
WE REALLY WANTED THE COMMUNITY

01:56:10.396 --> 01:56:13.933
TO BE -- KNOWN AS A FRIENDLY

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:14.701

HAS LOST LOVED ONES TO THE NEW

01:56:29.515 --> 01:56:31.551
RIVER -- MY MOTHER WORKED IN A

01:56:31.617 --> 01:56:33.119
SAFE WAY THAT WAS -- PROBABLY

01:56:33.186 --> 01:56:34.754
ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED FEET FROM THE

01:56:34.821 --> 01:56:36.255
NEW RIVER WHICH AT THIS POINT

01:56:36.322 --> 01:56:37.690

RIGHT NEXT TO THAT RIVER AND AS

01:56:44.330 --> 01:56:44.964
IT WAS BEING BUILT I DIDN'T

01:56:45.031 --> 01:56:46.599
UNDERSTAND WHY IT WASN'T GONNA

01:56:46.666 --> 01:56:47.800
BE ENCASED.

01:56:47.867 --> 01:56:49.001

THOSE FIRST DAYS OF APRIL -- IT

01:57:10.523 --> 01:57:11.724
FELT HORRIBLE TO KNOW THAT THERE

01:57:11.791 --> 01:57:12.759
