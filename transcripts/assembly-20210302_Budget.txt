TO WORK OUR WAY TO TRY TO BE OPEN SCHOOLS WE'VE ALL SEEN THE DEVASTATING EFFECTS OF HAVING SCHOOL OF CLOTHES WHETHER IT IS LEARNING LOSS WHETHER IT'S SOCIAL ISOLATION WHETHER IT IS- DEFECTS IN TERMS OF HOW DIFFICULT IT IS FOR OUR TEACHERS AND OUR EDUCATORS. WE KNOW THAT ONCE IT IS SAFE TO GO BACK TO SCHOOLS ONCE THERE WAS A VACCINE ONCE WE COULD- PROCURE ENOUGH P. P. E. N. KEEP PEOPLE APART- THAT WE SHOULD GO AHEAD AND DO SO SB EIGHTY SIX IS PROVIDING FUNDS FOR LEARNING RECOVERY AS WELL AS- RE OPENING SCHOOLS OVER SIX BILLION DOLLARS TO. GIVE INCENTIVES TO THE DISTRICTS INTO THE EDUCATORS AND THE PARENTS TO COME BACK IN SOME FASHION AN OPEN BACK UP WE BELIEVE THAT THIS- CAN TAKE ALL THE EXCUSES OFF THE TABLE. WE KNOW THAT THEIR NUMBER CONCERNS ABOUT SAFETY REASONABLE CONCERNS ABOUT HEALTH AND SAFETY WE BELIEVE THAT WE'RE OFFERING THE RESOURCES SO THAT DISTRICTS CAN- AND SHOULD OFFER THE PROPER HEALTH AND SAFETY WE KNOW THE VACCINATION WAS A CONCERN. WITH THE GOVERNOR SETTING ASIDE 10% OF THE STATE'S VACCINE INVENTORY FOR EDUCATORS TO PRIORITIZE EDUCATORS AND CHILD CARE PROVIDERS. WE BELIEVE IT'S A HUGE STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION TO ENSURE THAT OUR EDUCATORS ARE BEING ABLE TO GET INTO LINE AND GET. VAX SUMMATION.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- GABLE AND OF ASSEMBLY BUT COMMITTEE- SPD SIX COMPASS THE THREE COMPONENTS OF THE STATE SAFE SCHOOLS FOR ALL PLAN. INTENDED TO FACILITATE THE SAFE AND PHASED APPROACH TO RE OPENING ALL PUBLIC SCHOOLS TO K. THROUGH TWELFTH GRADE. FOR IN PERSON INSTRUCTION DURING THE CURRENT SCHOOL YEAR. THIS INCLUDES PUBLIC HEALTH AND SCHOOL STATUS DATA AND VACCINES. SCHOOL RE OPENING INCENTIVE GRANTS AND STUDENT LEARNING RECOVERY GRANTS. SINCE WE COVERED THIS BILL IN GREAT LENGTH LAST WEEK I WILL FCUS IN MY REMARKS ON THE DIFFERENCES FROM IN THE ADDITIONS TO THE SB EIGHTY SIX VEHICLE THAT YOU HEARD LAST WEEK. SB EIGHTY SIX WOULD RETAIN THE DATA AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AS- YOU HEARD LAST WEEK. BUT ADDS TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS A NON PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND ENFORCEMENT. TO FOR THIS BILL. THIS BILL ALSO WOULD. REQUIRE THE STATE TO PRIORITIZE ALL TIER ONE BE ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUALS EQUALLY. AND INSTEAD OF THEIR IN LIEU OF THE LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH REQUIREMENT YOU HEARD LAST WEEK WOULD REQUIRE THE STATE TO CREATE A 10% SET ASIDE. FOR THE STATE'S THIRD PARTY VACCINE ADMINISTRATION CONTRACT FOR EDUCATION SECTOR WORKERS IN ONE B. SPECIFICALLY FOR K. TWELVE SCHOOL EMPLOYEES AND CHILD CARE WORKERS THAT ARE. OPERATING OR WORKING ON OPEN CAMPUSES. FOR RE OPENING IT IN PERSON INSTRUCTION FUNDING SB EIGHTY SIX WOULD CONTINUE TO PROVIDE TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT FUNDS FOR IN PERSON INSTRUCTION GRANTS TO EVERY ALLEY A ACCEPT NON CLASSROOM BASED CHARTERS. TO FACILITATE A SAFE RETURN TO IN PERSON INSTRUCTION WITH THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONS. BY MARCH THIRTY FIRST ELEAZAR SHALL OFFER IN SCHOOL INSTEAD IN PERSON INSTRUCTION FOR VULNERABLE TKA THROUGH TO STUDENT GROUPS. CERTAIN SMALL COHORTS USING EXISTING DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH SMALL COHORT GUIDANCE. THIS REQUIRES SCHOOLS TO PROVIDE IN PERSON INSTRUCTION TO SMALL COHORTS OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE CHILDREN REGARDLESS OF THE TIER OF THEIR COUNTIES FOR PUBLIC HEALTH PURPOSES. THE DEFINITIONS OF THOSE HORRIBLE STUDENTS REMAIN THE SAME AS THE VERSION YOU HEARD LAST WEEK. BY MARCH THIRTY FIRST IF I COUNTY IS IN THE PURPLE TEAR. I WITH CASES LESS THE TWENTY FIVE CASES PER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND IN THEIR POPULATION. ELEAZAR SHALL RE OPEN FOR IN PERSON INSTRUCTION FOR TKA THROUGH TO STUDENTS AND STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES. SCHOOLS THAT ARE INTENDING TO RE OPEN FOR TKA THROUGH TWO AS STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES IN THE PURPLE TEAR ARE REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH THE STATE TESTING PROTOCOLS. THEY ARE ALSO REQUIRED TO SUBMIT THEIR SAFETY PLANS TO THE STATE DEPARTMENT. BY MARCH THIRTY FIRST OF A. COUNTY IS IN THE RED TIER ELEAZAR SHALL OPEN FOR IN PERSON INSTRUCTION FOR T. K. THROUGH SIX STUDENTS OR WHATEVER THEIR HIGHEST ELEMENTARY GRADE IS. SCHOOLS ARE ALLOWED TO OPEN SOONER WITH A COVE IT'S- CODE NINETEEN SAFETY PLAN PURSUANT TO CURRENT PUBLIC HEALTH GUIDANCE. BY MARCH THIRTY FIRST IF THE COUNTY IS IN THE RED DEER ALLEVIATE SHALL RE OPEN FOR IN PERSON INSTRUCTION FOR ALSO AT LEAST ONE GRADE IN MIDDLE THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL. ONCE AGAIN CONSISTENT WITH SB EIGHTY SIX AS YOU HEARD LAST WEEK BUT CLARIFIED IN THIS LANGUAGE SCHOOLS THAT CHOOSE TO OPEN EARLIER BUT HAVE ALREADY OPENED. OR HAVE ALREADY ADOPTED A RE OPENING PLAN BUT HAVE NOT YET BEEN ABLE TO OPEN ARE ALLOWED TO ACCESS THESE FUNDS AND TO CONTINUE TO OPERATE UNDER THEIR LOCALLY NEGOTIATED AGREEMENTS. STUDENT LEARNING RECOVERY GRANTS. THIS BILL WOULD PROVIDE FOUR POINT FIVE SIX BILLION ONE TIME PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT FUNDING FOR STUDENT LEARNING RECOVERY GRANTS TO EVERY SCHOOL DISTRICT. TO FACILITATE THE LAUNCH OF A MULTI YEAR LEARNING LOSS PLAN CONSISTENT WITH THE PRIOR VERSION OF SB EIGHTY SIX THAT YOU HEARD LAST WEEK. IT PROVIDES THESE GRANTS BASED OFF OF THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA FOR IN PERSON SUPPLEMENTARY INSTRUCTION AND SERVICES TO ADDRESS LEARNING LOS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NOW WE'RE GONNA TURN TO MR FERGUSON DEPARTMENT FINANCE. IF YOU COULD JUST START I BELIEVE IF YOU START SPEAKING SHOULD COME ON THE SCREEN. GREAT THANK YOU- MISTER CHAIR AND THANK YOU MR VICE CHAIR- I THINK ERIN'S PRESENTATION TO SIMPLY COVERS A MANY OF THE COMPONENTS BABY EIGHTY SIX. ARE THERE ARE A COUPLE ADDITIONAL COMPONENTS THAT I WOULD- NOTE IT DOES THAT ABDC DOES CONTAIN LANGUAGE- TO AUTHORIZE THE COMMISSION ON THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION TO. WAIVE THE REQUIREMENT FOR CERTAIN STUDENTS TO SUBMIT A STANDARDIZED TEST SCORE IN LIEU OF A GPA- THEREBY ENABLING THE STUDENTS TO BOTH APPLY FOR AND BE ELIGIBLE FOR A CAL GRANT- AS WELL AS AB EIGHTY SIX ALSO. EXTENDS THE TIME LINE FOR THE EXPENDITURE OF CORONAVIRUS FOR THE FUNDS ARE PROVIDED TO US SCHOOL DISTRICTS. I IN LAST FALL'S BUDGET- WITH THAT- I CONCLUDE MY REMARKS BY SAYING I THINK THE- YOU AGREEMENT BEFORE YOU REPRESENTS- WEEK SO A VERY IMPORTANT DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN- THE LEGISLATURE YOU KNOW THE SENATE THE ASSEMBLY AND THE ADMINISTRATION- THESE EFFORTS DEMONSTRATE THE HIGH PRIORITY- ALL PARTIES ARE PLACED ON RETURNING STUDENTS EDUCATORS AND STAFF. SAFELY BACK TO SCHOOLS- AND A CONCLUDE RAIMES MICHAEL MARKS. YOU WE CAN NOW TO HELP TO MISTER FROM LA. FOR ANY COMMENTS. GOOD MORNING MEMBERS A WE WERE THE LARGEST AND OFFICE SO WE DON'T HAVE ANY. REMARKS THAT WE ARE TO AND ANY TAKEN QUESTIONS THAT MEMBERS HALF. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NOW WITH MR OVER TO MA'AM. WHO QUESTIONS. MISS MCCARTY. THANK YOU- MISTER BUDGET CHAIR. BEFORE I TALK ABOUT WHAT BEFORE US I JUST WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE OBVIOUS THAT YOU SPEND A LOT OF. LEADING THE- THE BUDGET. THE ASSEMBLY THE AKA ABOUT FOR. THAT CALIFORNIA'S I KNOW WE WERE- TALKING TO. PEOPLE UP AND DOWN STATE MAKING SURE WE ADDRESS THE PRIORITY- OF OUR- AND- I DO KNOW THAT I HEARD FROM YOU LATE AT NIGHT EARLY IN THE MORNING AND WE CAN SO THIS ISN'T A VICTORY LAP I JUST WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE FACT THAT YOU PUT IN THAT EXTRAORDINARY AMOUNT. OF TIME AS DID OUR KßT STAFF SO JUST WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT OUT OF OUT OF THE GATE AND THIS OF COURSE IS OUR ELUSIVE EDUCATION. BUDGET CODED PACKAGES IT WILL BE VOTING ON IT A COUPLE DAYS- I KNOW THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA IN THE COMMUNITIES IN THE SCHOOL DISTRICT HAVE BEEN WAITING THEY'VE BEEN DOING IT ON THEIR OWN RIGHT HERE IN OUR DISTRICT WE HAVE- PROBABLY ABOUT A THIRD OF OUR DISTRICTS THAT ARE. HAVE ALREADY REOPENED OR ABOUT TO IN THE COMING WEEKS. AND OUR GOAL IS FOR THIS PACKAGE IS TO FURTHER INCENTIVIZE HELL COULD JOEL WHATEVER IT TAKES. AS YOU SAID THAT THERE SHOULD BE A LOT OF EXCUSES- WE HEARD THAT THE WISHES TO DO NO HARM PROVIDED ADDITIONAL RESOURCES HELP US SECURE VACCINES- A LOT OF THAT STUFF IS HAPPENING ANYWAY SOMETIMES BETTER TO BE LUCKY THAN GOOD- BUT CERTAINLY WE THINK THAT THIS IS REALLY GOING TO. ADVANCE THE GOAL IS TO IS TO GET BACK IN PERSON INSTRUCTION IN A SAFE MANNER. OF COURSE IT'S NOT BUSINESS AS USUAL WILL BE A HYBRID TYPE MODEL AND- THEALSO THE ISSUE THAT WE NEED TO BE MINDFUL OF ITS NOT JUST OPENING OUR SCHOOLS NOW BUT SO MANY OF OUR KIDS. HAVE THIS TREMENDOUS LEARNING LOSS AND WE TALKED LAST TIME ABOUT THE RESEARCH AND PASTE TALK ABOUT THIRD OF CAD- AFRICAN AMERICAN LATINO STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA. HAVE MONTHS AND MONTHS MONTHS OF LOSS AND THAT'S NOT GOING TO COME BACK ON- APRIL FIRST FIRST APRIL FIFTY. MY FIFTEEN THAT'S GOING TO TAKE- HELLO OF TIME TO AND- THE MONEY THIS. PART THE PEACE WHICH I THINK IS. AS A IMPORTANT. IS THE THIRD LOS RESOURCE TO FOR ON THE-HE- AND DOING THAT IN PER. BECAUSE BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT- MORE ZOOM SCHOOL IS GOING TO FIX THE WELLS OF THEM SCHOOL. SO- I THINK THAT THIS- WASN'T. CLEARLY THE AS AS A AS AS WHAT WE STARTED IN DECEMBER WITH A B. TEN BUT IT. IT FOCUSES ON A LOT OF THE ELEMENTS AND REALLY ADAPTS TO WHAT. IS HAPPENING OUT THERE AND YOU KNOW WE WERE WE WALKED WITH WE WORKED WITH THE ADMINISTRATORS AND- TEACHERS AND CLASSIFIED WORKERS AND OTHERS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE- CAN ADDRESS ALL THESE ISSUES SO- I KNOW WE'RE NOT VOTING ON TODAY- THIS IS A CHANCE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS. AND I THINK THAT THIS REALLY SET UP GET OUR SCHOOLS BACK ON SOME. THANK YOU. THANK YOU TURN OVER OUR VICE CHAIR. I THANK YOU WITH THE CARE- I'VE QUESTIONS ME TO FROM OF FINANCE THIS IS BE A AREA I THINK YOU SHED SOME ON- SOME. MEN OF OUR DISTRICTS ARE. STILL ON THE- BECAUSE OF- THE NEED TO SUBMIT SAFETY PLANS- THE SAFETY REVIEW WAVE THAT ARE STABBING. AND WE'RE CERTAINLY GOING TO BE TAKING ACTION ON THIS BILL BEFORE. THOSE WAIVERS HAVE BEEN APPROVED OR OR IF THEY'RE DENIED IT OVER THAT MATTER- CAN YOU GIVE ME A KIND OF A SENSE OF WHERE WE ARE OR WHERE THE MISSION IS IN TERMS OF THE SAFETY REVIEW WAIVERS. HOW EXPEDITIOUSLY ARE THEY GOING TO BE REVIEWING THEM. IN APPROVING THEM HOPEFULLY- IS THERE FRAMEWORK THAT THE ADMINISTRATION. IS LOOKING AT TO GET THIS DONE. SURE I'D IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH- IS LOOKING AT- THOSE WAIVERS AND THEY ARE WORKING YOU KNOW WITHIN THE GUIDANCE. ARE PROVIDED CHIU- APPROVE THOSE WAIVERS OF WAR EDUCATE THOSE WAIVERS- SO CERTAINLY THAT IS IN PROCESS- AND MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT BY. THERE IS AN ATTEMPT TO- PROCESS THOSE APPLICATIONS AS EXPEDITIOUSLY AS POSSIBLE. OKAY I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE MINISTRATION IS AWARE OF HOW IMPORTANT THESE LABORS ARE IN TERMS OF THEIR ABILITY TO COME BACK TO SCHOOL AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. SO- AND IN TERMS OF THAT GETTING INTO THE WEEDS A LITTLE BIT ON THE FOUR POINT SIX. BILLION FOR THE ADDITIONAL- AND INSTRUCTOR EDUCATION- MY UNDERSTANDING IN READING OF THE BILL IS THAT IT HAS THE FUNDS HAVE TO BE EXPENDED- AUGUST TWENTY TWENTY ALLOWING SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO. HAVE ACCESS TO THOSE FUNDS IN THE TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY TWENTY THREE SCHOOL YEAR- WHY WAS AUGUST TWENTY TWENTY TWO CHOSEN INSTEAD OF. MAYBE DECEMBER TWENTY TWENTY TWO. THE ALLOWING SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO USE UP IN THE YEAR OF A CALENDAR. YEAR YES VICE CHAIR AND ERIN CABLE FROM THE- BUDGET- D. OF LARGEST. AND WAS EXPRESSED INCOME- WITH. THE AND- TO REALLY APPROACH LEARNING RECOVERY COMPREHENSIVELY OVER A MULTI YEAR PERIOD. THIS EARLY ACTION FUNDING IS INTENDED TO BE ABLE TO. START THAT PROCESS AND SO WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT TO SUMMER'S WORTH OF PLANNING AND FUNDING COULD BE PUT ON THE TABLE AS PART OF THIS EARLY ACTION PACKAGE TO ALLOW FOR. A THOUGHTFUL LOCAL CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW TO CONSTRUCT THOSE PLANS AND WE INTEND TO REVISIT- THE FUNDING LEVELS FOR THOSE PLANS AS WE GET INTO THE GYM BUDGET. SO IT COULD BE THAT THEIR- WOULD BE ADDITIONAL DATES AND FUNDING AS FAR AS PART OF THAT AS WELL. OKAY AND THEN- I GUESS MY LAST QUESTION IS IN TERMS OF- TO THE- TO THE AVERAGE PARENT- THERE SEEMS TO BE. A BUT CERTAINLY OCCUR A NEED IN A CONCERN TO FOCUS ON CATER. SIXTEEN THOUGH THERE'S IT SEEMS TO BE KIND OF A PHASE APPROACH. WHAT IS IT I GUESS THAT IS IN THIS BILL THAT WILL. GIVE THEM- RELIEF FORCE OR WHAT WHAT CAN PARENTS ABOUT MIDDLE SCHOOL STUDENTS AND HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS EXPECT- IN THIS BILL. IT SEEMS LIKE THAT. IT'S ONE GRADE LEVEL- FOR MIDDLE SCHOOL AT SOME POINT AND THEN THE HIGH SCHOOLS AS WELL. CAN YOU CAN YOU. I GUESS EXPAND UPON. WHAT INCENTIVE OF HIGH SCHOOL AND MIDDLE SCHOOL- HAVE TO REOPEN QUICKER. SO THE IS THE SUM TO. EIGHTY SIX TWO A AT LEAST ONE GRADE MIDDLE SCHOOL THROUGH HIGH. WAS A NEWMAN STAND THAT WE WERE INTRODUCED TO ASPIRIN THOSE CONVERSATIONS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL SO TO. REPEAT ALL OF THE STANDARDS FOR RE OPENING THAT ARE CONTAINED IN SB EIGHTY SIX ARE INTENDED TO BE A MINIMUM FLOOR. FOR THOSE I SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO ADOPT A MORE COMPREHENSIVE PLAN ALREADY TODAY. OKAY I THINK THAT'S ALL THE QUESTIONS I HAVE AT THE BIGGEST. THANK YOU MISTER DONALD. I JUST WANTED TO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- FOR ALL YOUR WORK ON THIS AND ALL THE ALL THE INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED IN MAKING THIS HAPPEN- VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THIS BUT THERE IS ONE THING I THINK WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO CONTINUE TO MONITOR. AND THAT IS THE- COMPONENT SPEAKS TO ATTEND FIRST THE 10% SET ASIDE FOR THE TEACHER VACCINATIONS. I WAS VERY IMPORTANT. THAT WE GET OUR TEACHERS ACROSSTHE STATE. VACCINATED OKAY. I'M NOT ASKING ANY TEACHER TO RETURN TO THE CLASSROOM WITHOUT BEING VACCINATED. SAID- THAT YOU KNOW I WOULDN'T RETURN TO THE CLASSROOM. WITHOUT BEING VACCINATED I'VE HAD COVERED I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT. THAT WE GET OUR TEACHERS VACCINATED I KNOW THAT'S ONE COMPONENT OF THIS BILL. A 10% SET ASIDE. BUT I REALLY URGE. THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH. BECAUSE YOU'RE GONNA BE IMPLEMENTING THIS. TO ENSURE THAT ACROSS THE STATE- WE ARE MONITORING THE COUNTIES TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE PUSHING THOSE VACCINES OUT TO OUR TEACHERS- WHETHER IT BE THE TWO DOSE VACCINE NOW APPARENTLY THERE'S THE ONE DOES THE JOHNSON AND JOHNSON MAYBE THAT WOULD BE THE ONE TO SET ASIDE. BECAUSE THE TIMELINE MIGHT BE TRUNCATED. FOR TEACHERS TO BE FULLY VACCINATED I'M NOT A SCIENTIST I DON'T KNOW. I KNOW SOME ASIDE- WE DON'T NEED TO DO THAT THERE'S THE CDC. WELL THE CDC'S BEEN RATHER INCONSISTENT. ON WHETHER OR NOT TEACHERS SHOULD RETURN TO THE CLASSROOM- EVEN DR FAUCI LAST WEEK. I WAS WATCHING ONE SUNDAY SHOWS. WHEN ASKED. WHEN DOCTOR FELT SHE WAS ASKED IF HE WOULD RETURN TO THE CLASSROOM AS A TEACHER- HE WOULDN'T ANSWER THAT QUESTION. IT'S JUST COMMON SENSE AND WE CAN DO IT. SO IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO ME. THAT WE FOCUS ON GETTING THOSE VACCINES OUT AND INTO THE ARMS OF TEACHERS. SO THAT WE CAN GET OUR KIDS BACK. INTO SCHOOL. AND ANOTHER THING THAT WE SHOULD CELEBRATED JUNE IT'S BEEN IT'S BEEN A LITTLE TOO HERE. IS CERTAINLY IT'S THE ROOT IT'S GETTING OUR KIDS BACK INTO THE CLASSROOM BUT THE LEARNING LOS COMPONENT WHICH MY COLLEAGUES HAVE SPOKEN. IS FUTURE. IT IS GIGANTIC. AT LAST IT IS NOT JUST. A ONE SUMMER THING. AND IT'S NOT LIKE THE SUMMER SCHOOL YOU MIGHT ADD. OUR INTENTION OF THAT THIS BE IS THAT IS THAT THIS BE. A MUCH MORE. COMPREHENSIVE SUMMER SCHOOL APPROACH OVER REALLY TWO SUMMERS. BUT EVEN IN THE INTERIM- STUDENTS WILL HAVE NEEDS ACADEMIC MADE TO SOCIAL EMOTIONAL NEEDS AND THAT'S WHAT THIS MONEY IS SET ASIDE TO ADDRESS. SO IT'S NOT ONLY PROBABLY TWO SUMMER SCHOOLS. BUT A LOT OF WORK TO BRING OUR STUDENTS. UP TO SPEED IN BETWEEN. SO THAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISSED ON ANY OTHER MEMBERS OF. COMMENTS SENATORS. THE FONG NOTICE- I'M A FIRST OF ALL WHEN I THINK YOU KNOW ALL OF THEM YOUR WORK ON THIS I KNOW THAT LOTS OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN- WORKING OVERTIME I'M TO TRYING TO GET HER KIDS BACK TO SCHOOL ON PARTICULARLY IN MY DISTRICT ABOUT HALF OF MY DISTRICT ARE OPEN UNDER WAIVERS AND HAVE SUBMITTED SAFETY PLANS. I'M IN MY SENIOR VALLEY SCHOOL DISTRICT I WANT TO GIVE A HUGE ROUND OF APPLAUSE TO OUR SUPERINTENDENT DR JOSEPH LYNSKEY WHO GOT ALL TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED OF HIS TEACHERS AND FACULTY VACCINATED WITH THE COUNTY OF VENTURA- WE ARE EXCITED ABOUT THE ROOM REDUCING NOW REDUCING CASES OF COVE IT- THE WIDER ACCESS TO VACCINES- ON THE 10% SET ASIDE- IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT FIRST TEACHERS IN MY DISTRICT- BUT THE BILL IS I THINK THIS BILL IS AN IMPORTANT FIRST STEP. BUT FOR ME I DO STILL HAVE CONCERNS THAT PARTICULARLY WHEN IT PERTAINS TO OUR JUNIOR HIGH MIDDLE SCHOOL AND HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS GETTING IN THE CLASSROOM- CAN YOU. TELL ME WHAT IN THIS BILL OR WHAT WHAT DOES THIS BILL DO TO GET ALL OF OUR MIDDLE CLASS IN HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS BACK. TO THE CLASSROOM AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. SO IN TERMS OF A MIDDLE SCHOOL AND HIGH SCHOOL ONCE AGAIN THIS IS JUST A MINIMUM FLOOR FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS- TO GET THEM STARTED THE INTENT HERE. IS TO- FACILITATE A SAFE FACED RE OPENING- OF THERE IS THAT UNDERLYING BELIEF IN THIS LEGISLATION THAT ADDS SCHOOL DISTRICTS GET MORE EXPERIENCE WITH SAFELY RE OPENING IN A PHASED APPROACH IT WILL DEVELOP THE CONFIDENCE NECESSARY. FOR PARENTS TO BE WILLING TO SEND THEIR CHILDREN BACK. AND FOR EMPLOYEES TO HAVE THE CAPACITY TO OPERATE SAFELY ON CAMPUS AND SO. WHILE THIS IS A MINIMUM FLOOR WE DO KNOW THAT THERE ARE MANY ELEAZAR ACROSS THE STATE THAT HAVE MUCH MORE COMPREHENSIVE OFFERINGS THAT THEY ARE PLANNING FOR THEIR MIDDLE SCHOOL STUDENTS. THE HIGH SCHOOL AND PIECE OF THIS HAS BEEN HARDER BECAUSE OF THE TRANSMISSION RATE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN OLDER STUDENTS AND YOUNGER STUDENTS AND THAT IS WHY. WE DID NOT SET A MINIMUM FOR THAT WAS HIGHER FOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS IN THIS LEGISLATION SO THEN AND IS IT LIKELY THAT OUR HIGH SCHOOL AND JUNIOR HIGH STUDENTS ARE GOING TO RETURN TO IN PERSON LEARNING UNTIL FALL. I THINK THAT THAT IS. A THIS POINT GOING CONTINUE TO BE A LOCAL DISCUSSION AND DETERMINATION. SO ONE OF MY OTHER CONCERNS- IS AROUND VICE IN MY SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE THE ON HER RETIREMENT STILL OF THE PROFESSIONALS. CAN YOU CLARIFY ARE THESE FUNDS ARE WOULD DISTRICTS BE ABLE TO. HIRE SOME OF THEIR- PART TIME CARE PROFESSIONALS INTO FULL TIME. PER PROFESSIONAL POSITIONS THAT WOULD BE A LOT YES OKAY. I AM. I ALSO WANT TO CLARIFY THE ISSUE WITH THE TESTING CADENCE PROVISIONS OF THE BILL. IF A. COUNTY IN THE RED TIER HAS SCHOOLS THAT OPEN BUT THE COUNTY BACK SLIDES INTO THE PURPLE TEAR AFTER RE OPENING WILL THOSE SCHOOLS BE REQUIRED TO ADHERE TO CD PH TESTING CADENCE FOR PURPLE TIER COUNTIES. THAT IS MY UNDERSTANDING YES. GREAT THOSE ARE ALL MY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS GARCIA. BUT THANK YOU I'M I'M I'M GOING TO VOTE FOR THIS BILL BECAUSE WHEN IT WE SEE IT IN THE FIRST THAT I WANT THE PERFECT TO BE THE ENEMY OF THE GOOD BUT FOR THE ADMINISTRATION AND OTHERS AS THE NAME AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AS WELL I HAVE. A LOT OF CONCERNS THAT WE ARE MAKING IT EASIER FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT ARE BETTER POSITIONED TO OPEN TO REOPEN AND COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE TO BE AT THE END OF THE LIST AGAIN FOR THOSE THREE OPENINGS MY READ OF AFFECTIONS ABOUT ONE IN FIVE. MY RATE OF EXCUSES ABOUT ONE IN TWENTY- WE ARE LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND EVEN WITH THESE ADDITIONAL DOLLARS IS NOT CLEAR THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE POSITION TO BE ABLE TO RE OPEN SAFELY OUT THERE AND SO I WAS A TEACHER FOR THIRTEEN YEARS I KNOW HOW IMPORTANT IT IS. FOR KIDS TO GET BACK TO THE CLASSROOM. I BUT ELSEWHERE TO MAKE SURE THEY WILL TO GET BY SAFELY MUCH OF THE- ARE WORRIED ALSO THE CA. MY ARE WORRIED ABOUT TENSIONS VISION. THERE AND WITHOUT GUARANTEE. THOSE FOR THESE COMMUTER MEMBERS. WERE NOT GOING TO BE OPEN. AND I'VE BEEN TO. THAT YOU KNOW MY SCHOOLS. FROM THAT 10% SET ASIDE. BECAUSE WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE OPEN BUT AS LONG AS WE'RE NOT BE RE VACCINATING WHENEVER GOING TO OPEN AND I HAVE. SOME OF THE HIGHEST LEARNING LOSS. SOME OF THE BIGGEST DIGITAL DIVIDE. THE LONGER I WAIT THE BIGGER IT GETS THE HARDER IT IS TO FILL IN SO WHILE WE'RE SETTING ASIDE SOME MONEY FOR JOINING US. I FEEL LIKE WE'RE SETTING THIS UP FOR FAILURE. AND SO I'M NOT GOING TO GET IN THE WAY OF THOSE THAT ARE PREPARED TO RE OPEN. BUT I DO THINK THAT WE ARE. SHORT OF WHAT WE NEED TO DO FOR COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE AND I HOPE THAT THE CONVERSATION QUICKLY. RAMPS UP IN THAT AND I AM ADVOCATING FOR THOSE TEACHERS IN THOSE HARDEST OF COMMUNITIES. TO BE AT THE FRONT OF THE LINE. ALL OF THEM THAT'S A TEACHERS THE MOVIE CARE OLIVER TICKELL IN PLACE AND WE REALLY WANT TO RE OPEN. EVERYBODY WORRY ABOUT THE EARLY LAWS AND EQUITY. THEY NEED TO BE AT THE FRONT OF THE LINE- AND SO. I JUST WANT GO ON THE RECORD OF. THAT ON THAT. I AM REALLY WORRIED OF. ONCE AGAIN BEING AT THE END THE LIST I WAS AT THE IN THE LIST FOR PP. I'VE BEEN AT THE IN THE LIST FOR TESTING. FOR VACCINES AND THIS IS THE BILL ANY DIFFERENT. AND IT'S HARD TO GO HOME AND FACE MY CONSTITUENTS. EVERY DAY TO TELL. THEM WAIT A LITTLE BIT LONGER. NO SIX. YOU FOR THE COMMENT THREE THINK YOU'RE- CORRECT- ESPECIALLY HAVE NOT DONE WHAT WE NEED TO DO FOR SO MANY COMMUNITIES THAT. ARE REALLY. AT THE HIGHEST RATE OF COVERT- BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THOSE ARE PRIMARILY THE HOMES TO ESSENTIAL WORKERS- THEY ARE THE ONES THAT ARE STRUGGLING THE MOST I THINK WE ACTUALLY AB. 101% HAVE TO DO. BETTER TO ENSURE THAT THEY'RE GETTING THE- HEALTH CARE RESOURCES AGAIN THE VACCINATIONS. AND I KNOW THAT THAT'S IN THAT WE CONTINUE TO ADVOCATE FOR BURKE CLICK YOU KNOW DOESN'T. DOESN'T MATTER IF WE ADVOCATE FOR WPF TO. DELIVER AND WE HAVE TO DO A BETTER JOB OF DELIVERING. TO ALL THOSE ALL THOSE COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE. THIS REST. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. I'D LIKE TO ECHO THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES EQUITY HAS BEEN DISCUSSED. AT EVERY LEVEL AND WE DO HAVE COMMUNITIES WHO DO NOT FEEL THAT THEY HAVE RECEIVED THEIR FAIR SHARE AND I APPRECIATE THE CHAIR'S COMMENTS I KNOW THAT THAT IS A COMMITMENT FROM THE ADMINISTRATION'S COMMITMENT FROM THIS HOUSE- I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR ALL THE WORK THAT YOU'VE PUT IN MISTER CHAIR AND- CHAIR SUB TO MOST MCCARTY. BUT I MOST ESPECIALLY WANT TO THANK THE TEACHERS. THEY NEVER STOP TEACHING THEY'VE BEEN TEACHING OUR KIDS DAY IN DAY OUT WEEKEND EVERY WEEK EVERY MONTH THEY CONTINUE TO TEACH AND I'M SO GRATEFUL TO THEM. YES WE HAVE A LEARNING LOS BUT I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT WOULD BE SUFFERING IF THE OUR TEACHERS HAD GIVEN UP ON OUR STUDENTS THEY DIDN'T THEY STAYED WITH OUR STUDENTS AND I'M EVER SO GRATEFUL TO THEM. FOR THAT. I APPRECIATE ALSO AND I HAD A MEETING THIS MORNING WITH MY DISTRICTS THEY SINCERELY APPRECIATE BEING ALLOWED THAT LOCAL CONTROL. TO BE ABLE TO DECIDE THEY KNOW THEIR COMMUNITIES BOUNCED. BUT I ALSO APPRECIATE THAT ALTHOUGH SOME OF THE DISTRICTS HAVE ALREADY DECIDED THEIR SCHOOL BOARDS OF ALREADY DECIDED. THAT THEY WILL NOT REOPEN UNTIL THE FALL. WITH THIS BILL WITH THE INCENTIVES BEING PROVIDED. I AM HOPEFUL THAT THEY WILL REVISIT. THEIR DECISION AND WILL MEET WITH OUR LOCAL DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH TO MAKE DECISIONS THAT. IN BETTER IT IMPACT OUR STUDENTS IF APPROPRIATE- THE PROCESS OF SAFELY RE OPENING OUR CAMPUSES. HAS BEEN AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE A BALANCE OF MAKING SURE STUDENTS DON'T FALL FURTHER BEHIND IN THEIR STUDIES WHILE PROTECTING THE HEALTH OF OUR TEACHERS OR SCHOOL EMPLOYEES. AT THE END OF THE STUDENTS ALL RIGHT I APPRECIATE THAT THE FOR THE BILL FOCUSES ON GETTING OUR YOUNGEST AND MOST VULNERABLE STUDENTS BACK ON CAMPUS. INCLUDING OUR HOMELESS STUDENTS ARE FOSTER STUDENTS OUR STUDENTS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS ARE ENGLISH LEARNERS KIDS WHO'VE BEEN CHRONICALLY ABSENT FROM THAT DISTANCE LEARNING AND STUDENTS AT RISK OF ABUSE AND. I APPRECIATE THAT THIS BILL. BUILDS ON THE FIFTH. WE'VE HEARD FROM OUR SCHOOLS FROM OUR FAMILIES FROM OUR COMMUNITIES FROM OUR TEACHERS ABOUT HOW TO RE OPEN OUR SCHOOLS IN THE SEPT SAFEST WAY POSSIBLE. I LOOK AT THE TIMES THAT WE'RE GOING THROUGH AND FRANKLY IT'S UNIMAGINABLE THAT AFTER A YEAR WE'RE NOW FINALLY LOOKING AT A PLAN TO RE OPEN OUR CLASSROOMS- IT'S AN IMPORTANT DAY AND IT STARTS WITH US. BEING ON THIS JOURNEY TO BRING SOME NORMALCY BACK TO THE LIVES OF OUR FAMILIES AND OUR CHILDREN. IN THE SAFEST WAY POSSIBLE. BUT I HOPE. AND I JOIN WITH MY COLLEAGUES FROM FROM LOS ANGELES I HOPE THAT WE DON'T FORGET THAT COBIT HOUSE EXPOSE THE INEQUITIES IN EDUCATION BUT I'M NOT GOING TO GO AWAY WHEN CHILDREN TURN TO CLASS ROOM TO THE CLASSROOM. AND I HOPE THAT THIS WILL REQUIRE US. TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON RECTIFYING THIS ISSUE NOW AND IN THE FUTURE EQUITY MUST BE OUR PLAN FOR THE FUTURE THANK YOU THANK YOU. THIS REVIEW. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I'M I THANK MY COLLEAGUE FROM SENATOR DINO MY COLLEAGUE FOOTBALL GUARDIANS- WE HAVE THIS DOES SAY ISSUES I HAVE COMMUNITIES ARE VERY VERY LOW INCOME AND THEN VERY OF AFRICAN I HAD A SUPERINTENDENT ROUNDTABLE LAST WEEK AND I HAD THIRTEEN SUPERINTENDENTS. AND OF COURSE AS YOU CAN IMAGINE THERE IT ISSUES WERE VERY VERY DIFFERENT SO THE POINT I WANT TO MAKE IS- FOR THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE FOR EXAMPLE THE CITY OF THE MONEY HAS A REALLY HIGH RATE OF INFECTION EVEN THOUGH WE'RE IN L. A. COUNTY. THE COMMUNITY IS AFRAID OF GOING BACK AND SOUL SOUL I ASKED- LAST WEEK IF BILLS A DISTRICTS WOULD BE ABLE TO GET A WAIVER- BECAUSE THEIR INFECTION RATE IS WAIT SOMETIMES FOUR TIMES AS HIGHER. AS HIGH AS OTHER NEIGHBORING DISTRICTS AFTER NUMBER ONE THE OTHER ISSUE THAT I HEARD WAS FROM MY SUPERINTENDENCIA EFFORT ON THE MAD RUSH TO SPEND THE MONEY WE'RE GOING TO SPEND THE MONEY AND IT'S AND I TAUGHT FOR SIXTEEN YEARS WITH THE SCHOOL BOARD FOR THIRTEEN AND WE GOT TO THE POINT WHERE THEY'RE LIKE IF YOU DON'T SPEND THAT BY FRIDAY. IT'S GOING TO GO AWAY SO WE ENDED UP BUYING THINGS THAT WE WERE OKAY TO BUY AS OPPOSED TO THINGS THAT WE REALLY REALLY NEED IT BECAUSE WE WERE UNDER A TIME FRAME SO I PLEAD WITH YOU THAT THAT SOME OF THESE DISTRICTS DO NOT FALL UNDER THAT YOU KNOW THAT- DEADLINE IF THEY CAN PROVE OR THERE'S SOME KIND OF A WAIVER. THAT RIGHT NOW THE COMMUNITY IS NOT. READY TO RE OPEN I AGREE WITH YOU KNOW THE STUDENT GETTING BACK TO SCHOOL I HAVE A THIRTEEN AND TWELVE YEAR OLD AND I'M DYING TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU KNOW THAT THEY GO BACK AND I'M SURE ALL OF THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS ARE- BUT AGAIN WE CAN'T TREAT. YOU KNOW ONE DISTRICT THE SAME AS THE OTHERS L. A. COUNTY IS HUGE I LIKE I SAID I AM THIRTEEN I HAVE EIGHTEEN SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND L. A. ONLY HAS ONE AND SO OBVIOUSLY THE DIFFERENCES ARE ARE VAST AND AGAIN I ASK THAT SOME OF MY DISTRICT ARE SOME OF THOSE DISTRICTS HAVE I I'M SURE I'M SURE THAT IT'S NOT JUST MY AREA THAT THAT WE HAVE THE SAME DYNAMICS AND- UP AND DOWN THE STATE. THAT THEY GET THE OPPORTUNITY TO AT LEAST DEMONSTRATE. THAT IT'S NOT FEASIBLE FOR THEM TO OPEN RIGHT NOW AND THAT THEY'RE NOT FORCED TO. THE MONEY JUST FOR THE SAKE OF. THANK YOU. THANK CABLE DO WANNA DRESS SOME OF THOSE QUESTIONS. YES THE- THE REASON THE LOW. FOR ON REQUIRED THE SAFE OPEN IT FOR COCA. REGARDLESS OF ACCOUNT TEAR RESPECT. OF TRYING TO DRAW THESE. WE WERE ONCE. THE VERY STE COHORT GUIDE THAT IS- BEEN DEEMED TO BE SAFE BY THE DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH REGARDLESS OF THE LEVEL OF COMMUNITY SPREAD. TO SIT TO SIT AS A BASELINE STANDARD FOR T. CASE THROUGH TWELVE. SO THAT EVEN IN COMMUNITIES WHERE WE DO HAVE GREAT CONCERN ABOUT. COMMUNITY SPREAD OR IF THERE WERE TO BE ITS TO BE ANOTHER SURGE IN THE FUTURE THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE STUDENTS ARE MOST LIKELY. TO HAVE ALREADY BEEN IMPACTED BY THE ACHIEVEMENT. GAP AND NOW TO BE IMPACTED BY. VERY LOW SCALE IN TERMS OF LEARNING RECOVERY. AT THAT THEY'D BE RECEIVING IN PERSON SUPPORT IMMEDIATELY AND CONTINUOUSLY. AND THEN FURTHER- THE ONLY OTHER REQUIREMENT IN THE PURPLE TEAR IS AROUND TWO TO THREE TWO. I WITH THE INCREDIBLY HIGH TESTING- CADENCES THAT THE STATE HAS REQUIRED. FOR SPECIFICALLY THIS PURPOSE SO TO ENSURE FOR THOSE SMALL GROUPS OF STUDENTS THE YOUNGER STUDENTS WERE THE LEAST LIKELY TO BE TRANSMITTING. AND CONTRIBUTING TO COMMUNITY SPREAD THERE ARE STILL SAFETY PROTOCOLS IN PLACE THAT ENSURE FOR THE TEACHERS SUPPORT THE SCHOOL EMPLOYEES AND FOR THE PARENTS OF THERE'S CONFIDENCE THAT ANY KIND OF- SPREAD THAT MAY START TO START ON A CAMPUS. WILL BE DETECTION VERY SWIFTLY AND CAN BE ACTED UPON. MISTER. THANK YOU GERMAN. I WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF LEARNING LOS- BY RELATING JUST THE STORY OF ONE YOUNG MAN- THAT I HOPE I THINK WE'LL BRING THIS ISSUE ALIVE IF AS I THINK OF ALL THE BIG STATISTICS OUT THERE- THERE IS ON- LATINO BOY. VERY BRIGHT FOURTH GRADER- WAS ONE OF THE BEST STUDENTS IN HIS CLASS IN TERMS OF MASS WAS METICULOUS ON TOP OF EVERYTHING SCHOOL WORKED WELL FOR ONE WHEN HE WAS IN SCHOOL BUT ONCE HOME SITUATION IS SUCH THAT HE DOES NOT HAVE SUPPORT AT HOME AND AS COVERT HERE. ONE STARTED FALLING BEHIND STARTED NOT GETTING GONE DIDN'T HAVE SUPPORT WHEN HIS WIFE I DIDN'T WORK- AND FOR. GRADUALLY FROM THE SYSTEM AND AS ONE FADED FROM THE SYSTEM HE FELL BEHIND IN MATH. AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE LEARNING LOSS IT'S BEEN REFERRED TO BY. ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES HERE I JUST WANT TO BRING THAT ONE HOME IF I FALL BEHIND IN READING IT'S EASIER TO CATCH UP. BUT IF YOU FALL BEHIND IN MATH PRETTY SOON YOU THINK YOU'RE NOT GOOD AT MATH AND THE MINUTE YOU THINK YOU'RE NOT GOOD AT MATH YOU'RE NOT GOOD AT MATH. BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT WILLING TO TAKE THAT THAT THAT NEXT STEP AND I'M SEEING THAT IN ONE AND TRYING- TO SEE. IF WOULD WE DEAL WITH LEARNING LOSS WE HAVE TO REALIZE SOME OF THIS WILL BE YOUR REVERSIBLE IF WE DON'T SPECIFICALLY FOCUS ON THINGS LIKE MATH AND MAKING SURE WE GET. THOSE STUDENTS BACK TO WHERE THEY WERE AT LEAST IN THE FOURTH GRADE LEVEL SO I WOULD JUST OFFER TO THINGS AND THAT IS WHEN WE PRIORITIZE. VACCINES FOR TEACHERS WE ARE ALSO PRIORITIZING. VACCINES FOR ONE. IN THAT'S ONE OF THE WHY I HOPE WE DO A GREAT JOB OF THIS PRIORITIZATION IN IN THAT AND THE OTHER TING IS THAT I. WANT TO IMPLORE OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO TRY TO TAKE THIS LEARNING LOS SERIOUSLY AND NOT JUST SET UP A WELL WE'VE GOT SUMMER SCHOOL IF YOU WANT TO COME. BUT REALLY TRY TO DIG DOWN AND FIND WHAT ARE THE SPECIFIC LOSSES OF EACH OF THOSE STUDENTS THAT THEY SHOULD PARTICULARLY. MUST CATCH UP ON QUICKLY AND I WOULD OFFER MATHIS IS PROBABLY IN IN MY MIND THE MOST CRITICAL THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU MISS KOREA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF FOR ALL OF YOUR HARD WORK ON WORKING ON THIS ISSUE AS WELL AS THE MEMBERS INVOLVED AND OF COURSE THAT THE COMMITTEE STAFFER. OTHER THEIR DILIGENT WORK ON THIS ISSUE AND I WANT TO THANK ALL OF OUR COLLEAGUES WHO ARE FORMER TEACHERS. WHO ARE NOW MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE WHO CAN ADD AN ADDITIONAL PERSPECTIVE. TO THIS VERY IMPORTANT TOPIC I HAVE NOT BEEN A TEACHER BUT I HAVE BEEN STUDENT. I THINK ALL OF S HERE HAVE AT SOME POINT. I REPRESENT L. THE LARGEST SCHOOL DISTRICT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE STUDENTS THAT ARE LISTED HERE STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES FOSTER AND HOMELESS YOUTH. STUDENTS AT RISK OF ABUSE OR NEGLECT OR WHAT OUR COLLEAGUE FROM SOUTH LA NOW A CALLS A- AT. STUDENTS ENGLISH I LIKE LEARNERS STUDENTS LACKING TO ACCESS DISK STUDENTS THIS IS A PRINTER FOOT PRINT OF EVERY STUDENT IN MY COMMUNITY AND WHILE I AM THANKFUL THAT WE'RE MOVING FORWARD WITH THE REOPENING AND I'M THANKFUL FOR THE TEACHERS THAT WANT TO GO BACK TO THE CLASSROOM AND THE VACCINATIONS THAT ARE GONNA TAKE PLACE. I ALSO WANT TO SAY THAT WE ARE LIVING IN THEM IN ALMOST THE A FALSE SENSE OF SECURITY BECAUSE WE CAN'T. WE CAN'T JUST SIMPLY RE OPEN SCHOOLS. AND VACCINATE TEACHERS WITHOUT LOOKING AT THE HOT ZONES IN OUR COMMUNITIES WHERE THE STUDENTS AND THOSE KIDS ARE COMING FROM. SEVERAL OF US IN HERE HAVE BEEN ADVOCATING FOR MONTHS. TO DO HOT STONE VACCINATION. BECAUSE WHAT IS THE POINT OF VACCINATING A TEACHER AND RING OPENING SCHOOLS WHEN YOU HAVE A FINANCIAL WORKERS WHO ARE PARENTS. WHO ARE MAYBE A COOK IN THE BACK OF A RESTAURANT. IN A KITCHEN SOMEWHERE WHO DOES NOT HAVE ACCESS TO THE VACCINE. THOSE FAMILIES ARE STILL EXPOSED THOSE CHILDREN ARE STILL EXPOSED AND WE ARE EXPOSING TEACHERS BY DOING THE SAME. SO I WOULD JUST IMPLORE THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND WHOEVER IS LISTENING WE HAVE TO RETHINK AND REIMAGINE. OUR VACCINE DISTRIBUTION PLAN FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND REALLY THINK ABOUT AN EQUITY LENS IT'S BEEN BROUGHT UP A LOT. WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS FOR MONTHS BUT THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO CORRELATION RIGHT NOW. IN TERMS OF HOW WE ARE VACCINATING HOT ZONES. WERE MOSTLY. OF PEOPLE OF COLOR LATINOS. ARE HIGHLY IMPACTED AND DYING STILL EVERY DAY. FROM THIS TERRIBLE. VIRUS AND WE'RE TALKING AS IF NONE OF THAT IS REAL. I EXPERIENCE IT EVERY DAY THERE ARE PEOPLE IN MY COMMUNITY THAT ARE DYING EVERY DAY. AND WE HAVE THESE HUGE VACCINE SITES THEY'RE NOT BEING USED BY THE PEOPLE OF MY COMMUNITY. MORE REPORTS REPORTS AND ARTICLES IN IN EVERY NEWSPAPER ACROSS THE STATE HAVE SIGNIFIED HAVE SIGNALED HOW. ARE EQUITY PROGRAM IS NOT WORKING. AND SO I'M JUST I'M CONCERNED I'M WORRIED AND I WANT TO HAVE IT ON RECORD. THAT THIS WELL THIS IS A GOOD STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION IT DOES NOT ADDRESS OUR HOT ZONES IT DOES NOT ADDRESS THE PARENTS OF THE CHILDREN OF THESE COMMUNITIES. IN THE DOES NOT ADDRESS THE ISSUES OF EQUITY. ON THE VACCINE ROULETTE BUT YOU KNOW I APPRECIATE ALL THE WORK BEING DONE BUT THERE'S STILL SO MUCH MORE THAT WE NEED TO AND HAVE TO DO. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER ROBERTS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MY QUESTION IS- REGARDING THE DIFFERENT DEADLINES AND TIMELINES THE- ARE- PUT OUT HERE AS FAR AS MARCH THIRTY FIRST AND THEN LOSING- BY APRIL FIRST- 1% FOR EACH DAY IN PERSON ULTIMATELY LEADING TO A MAY FIFTH- FORFEITURE OF THE MAY FIFTEENTH FOR THE FOR FORFEITURE OF THE FULL GRANT. ARE WE SETTING UP ALLEY ACE TO BE ABLE TO- PROVIDE AN ADEQUATE PLAN IN THIS TIME FRAME N. F. L. LIAISE ARE WORKING TOWARDS THAT PLAN IS THEIR WORK ABILITY WITH THE ALLEY ACE TO MAKE SURE THEY COMPLY GIVING THEM- SOME TYPE OF- HONOR SYSTEM MOVING TOWARDS GETTING TO THAT POINT I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS TIME FRAME AND THE DISCUSSION OF HOW WE CAME UP WITH THOSE DEADLINES. THERE WAS INPUT ON MAKING SURE THAT THERE WAS CONTABILIDADE THAT ALLEY ASIAN% THE STATE COULD COMPLY WITH THESE DEADLINES THAT ARE HERE BEFORE THE FORFEITURE OF GRANTS- BY MAY FIFTEENTH. THANK YOU SO THE WAY THAT THE FUNDING WOULD WORK IN A SPECIFIC TO THE TWO BILLION FOR RE OPENING GRANTS- AND BE ALL OF THE FUNDING IS GOING TO BE- AWARDED TO ELIE A SPACE UP THERE L. C. F. F. SO ALL SCHOOL DISTRICTS WILL HAVE ACCESS TO THIS FUNDING. IN THE PENALTIES BEGIN FOR EACH DAY STARTING APRIL FIRST UNTIL MAY FIFTEENTH THAT THEY HAVE NOT OPENED FOR EXACTLY THAT PURPOSE YOU JUST EXPRESSED A SEMI MEMBER IT IS INTENDED. TO ALLOW THOSE ELEAZAR WHO ARE NOT ABLE TO MEET THE STRICT REQUIREMENTS OF MARCH THIRTY FIRST BUT DO YOU IN GOOD FAITH ADOPT A RE OPENING DATE BETWEEN MARCH THIRTY FIRST AND MAY FIFTEENTH. TO ALLOW THEM TO HAVE A PORTION OF THAT FUNDING TO ACCOMMODATE THE EXPENSES THEY WILL HAVE FOR SAFELY RE OPENING. MR IF I MAY. AND WE BELIEVE THAT THAT TIME FRAME IS ENOUGH AN ADEQUATE TIME FOR ALLEY ACE TO BE ABLE TO COMPLY. WITH THE PLAN THAT IS ACCEPTABLE- FOR TO CONTINUE THE GRANT- FUNDING TO CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD TO ALLIE X. WE DO. THANK YOU AND THEN JUST ONE MORE QUESTION ON THE TWO YEARS WITH THE COUNTIES- IF THE COUNTY DOES SLIP. BACK INTO THE HIGHER TIER. DOES THAT MEAN THAT LOCAL ALLEY AS THAT WOULD HAVE TO ADJUST AND THERE COULD BE A COMPONENT OF OPENING AND CLOSING. WITHIN THE SCHOOLS ITSELF BASED ON THAT TIER OF THE COUNTIES. SO THE WAY THAT IT WORKS UNDER CURRENT PUBLIC HEALTH GUIDANCE THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT HAVE SAFELY RE OPENED WITHIN A WITHIN ADOPTED PLAN AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. THAT WOULD CONTINUE TO BE A GUIDING THEIR OPENING AND CLOSING. DECISION MAKING AND THEY'RE TESTING THEIR DISTANCE SAYING ALL OF THESE REQUIREMENTS WOULD BE. GRANDFATHERED IN SO IF THEY WERE TO HAVE. LET'S SAY- SLIPPED FROM THE RED TEAR BACK INTO THE PURPLE TEAR AT ANY POINT. THEY ARE- SUPPOSED TO PROVIDE CONTINUE TO PROVIDE CONTINUOUS INSTRUCTION TO THEIR STUDENTS- UNTIL THEY HAVE BEEN ORDERED TO BE CLOSED BECAUSE OF PUBLIC HEALTH. SO WHAT YOU WILL SEE IS IF FOR EXAMPLE THEY WERE IN THE RED TEAR AT THE WOULD HAVE BEEN OPERATING UNDER THEIR RED TIER REQUIREMENTS. IF THEY SLIPPED BACK INTO THE PURPLE TEAR. THEY WOULD THEN SHIFT TO THEIR LOCAL PLANTS PURPLE TIER REQUIREMENTS. FOR THOSE ELEAZAR WHO HAVE NOT ADOPTED A PURPLE TEAR PLAN BY MARCH THIRTY FIRST THE DEFAULT WILL BE THE STATE'S PURPLE. REQUIREMENTS AND SO THEREFORE IF THEY WERE TO HAVE SLIPPED FROM RED TEAR. INTO PURPLE TEAR THEY WOULD GO BACK INTO THOSE REQUIREMENTS BUT- IT ALSO IS VERY CLEAR THE LEGISLATION. THAT THE INTENT IS FOR CONTINUOUS STUDENT INSTRUCTIONS SO ONCE AN ALLEY A- HAS DETERMINED HOW TO SAFELY RE OPEN. AND STARTED OFFERING IN PERSON INSTRUCTION TO THOSE STUDENTS TO THOSE CHILDREN. THEY ARE INTENDED TO DO SO UNTIL PUBLIC HEALTH ORDERS THEM TO BE CLOSED. THERE ARE CURRENT PROGRAM ENTERS IN THE GUIDANCE FOR WHEN THEY DO NEED TO CLOSE. BASED OFF OF AN INDIVIDUAL SCHOOL SITES SPREAD INFECTION LEVEL. AS WELL. AS AROUND COMMUNITY SPREAD. THANK YOU DOCTOR WHAT. YES THANK YOU LIST THANK YOU EVERYONE WHO FOR ALL THE INCREDIBLE WORK ON THIS AND I. I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS I JUST I JUST HAD A QUESTION- IS WE'RE TRYING TO GET BACK TO IN PERSON LEARNING. IS THERE ARE THERE ANY REQUIREMENTS ON WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE COULD BE AN HOUR A DAY OR IS IT A FULL DAY OF LEARNING- IS THAT COMPLETELY AT THE DISCRETION OF DISTRICTS SO. COULD THEY ARE TECHNICALLY OPEN FOR AN HOUR AND RECEIVE THIS FUNDING- I JUST YEAH IS IT IS BECAUSE I DON'T FEEL LIKE THAT'S REALLY OUR INTENT BUT BUT I DON'T KNOW I MEAN COULD THEY DO THAT. THE BILLS AS CURRENTLY WRITTEN ONCE AGAIN AS A MINIMUM STANDARD DOES NOT SET A MINIMUM STANDARD FOR THE NUMBER OF IN PERSON INSTRUCTIONAL MINUTES OR IN PERSON. A SERVICES SO THAT WOULD BE A LOCAL DECISION. OKAY SO I DID HEAR FROM- ASSEMBLY MEMBER MADONNA DONNA FROM- ARE CALLING FROM A LONG BEACH THESE ME- AND HE TALKED ABOUT SUMMER SCHOOL- AND- BUT I DON'T SEE ANYTHING IN THERE REALLY ENCOURAGING SUMMER SCHOOL SO THAT'S ALL GOING TO BE COMPLETELY AT THE DISCRETION OF LOCAL DISTRICTS AS WELL OR DID I MISS SOMETHING. SEVEN PM LANGUAGE AROUND THE LEARNING RECOVERY IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE LANGUAGE THAT YOU ADOPTED IN THE BUDGET ACTOR INSTRUCTIONAL TIME. SO WE HAVE A MINIMUM INSTRUCTIONAL MINUTES PERIOD IN THE EDUCATION CODE- AND SPECIFIC TO IN DISTANCE LEARNING RIGHT NOW WHICH IS EQUIVALENT ROUGHLY TO A MINIMUM DAY. FOR ANY INDIVIDUAL SCHOOL SO THOSE MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR INSTRUCTIONAL TIME WHETHER IN DISTANCE LEARNING OR IN PERSON WOULD REMAIN IN PLACE BUT IT WOULD BE A LOCAL DISCRETION. AS TO WHICH COMBINATION OF EACH TO ACHIEVE THE IN PERSON INSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS IN SB EIGHTY SIX. SPECIFIC TO THE LEARNING RECOVERY FUNDS THOSE ARE TO BE A SPECIFICALLY IT CALLS OUT OF THOSE ARE SUPPLEMENTARY TO THE INSTRUCTIONAL MINUTES. SO THERE ARE SOME EXCEPTIONS TO THAT LIKE ONE ON ONE TUTORING OR SMALL GROUP PULLOUT. WHERE YOU COULD SEE A STUDENTS LEARNING RECOVERY PLANNING DURING THEIR INSTRUCTIONAL TIME WHERE THEY'RE GETTING SOMETHING. DIFFERENT IN SIGNIFICANT INTENSIVE BUT THE INTENT OVERALL IS THAT IF IT IS. AFTER SCHOOL BEFORE SCHOOL SUMMER SCHOOL THE OUR INTENSIVE SUPPORTS THAT ARE ABOVE AND BEYOND THE INSTRUCTIONAL DAY. SO AND THEN I GUESS MY FINAL QUESTION DO WE HAVE ANY INDICATION OF. HOW MANY SCHOOLS WILL ACTUALLY TRY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT- IN THE INTERESTS OF. HELPING STUDENTS RECOVER. I THINK THAT IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT THE LEARNING RECOVERY PART OF THIS BILL HAS BEEN UNIVERSALLY APPRECIATED BY EDUCATION LEADERS ACROSS THE STATE- THE EDUCATORS MANAGEMENT FOLKS ARE VERY- EAGER TO START. LAYING A PATH FORWARD FOR IN PERSON SUPPLEMENTARY LEARNING RECOVERY EFFORTS. AND TEACHERS HAVE AS WELL AS USE OF OKAY. OKAY THANK YOU. IT AND IT JUST IT JUST OF BIRTH FOR THE CLARIFY THE WAY THE FOUR POINT SIX BILLION. IN LEARNING COVERING WAS STRUCTURED- 85% OF IT HAS TO BE USED FOR IN PERSON INSTRUCTION. SO WHAT THEY CAN DO SOME LEVEL OF ONLINE OR DISTANCE LEARNING- THE BALL BECAUSE IT REALLY HAS TO BE USED FOR IN PERSON. MISTER JONES SAWYER. AND I JUST WANNA GO TO STEP BY A COMMENT- I'M IN WINDOWS NEED CITY WHERE UP I HAVE THE MOST LA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICTS- MEMBERS IN MY DISTRICT AND I HAVE THE MOST CHARTER SCHOOLS. THE SECOND MOST CHARTER SCHOOLS IN MY DISTRICT MY CALLING TO THE NORTH HAS THE MOST CHARTER SCHOOLS IN THE SECOND MOST L. UFT SCHOOLS AND SO WE REPRESENT A LARGE SWATH OF WHAT'S GOING ON- AND I'M REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT LEARNING LOSS- MY DAUGHTER. IS A HIGH SCHOOL MATH TEACHER IF YOU TALK TO ANY MATH TEACHERS THEY WILL TELL YOU THAT IF YOU COULD MATCH THE MATH YOU CAN MASTER ANYTHING IN THE WORLD. AND SHE WANTS TO BE SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS ONE DAY AND SHE'S ALWAYS TOLD ME IF I CAN GET EVERY STUDENT IN MY DISTRICT TO MASTER. ALGEBRA IN MIDDLE SCHOOL THEY'LL BE ABLE TO GET TO COLLEGE BE ABLE TO FILL AN APPLICATION BE SUCCESSFUL. IF YOU MISSED THAT IN THE MIDDLE SCHOOL. THAT COULD BE DEVASTATING FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE AND SO THAT'S WHY LEARNING LOSS IS SO IMPORTANT SPACE FOR AFRICAN AMERICAN LATINO STUDENTS. WORKER IT JUST FEELS LIKE AND THIS IS WHAT I GET FOR MY CONSTITUENTS IT ALMOST FEELS LIKE WHEN IT COMES TO THE PANDEMIC WHEN IT COMES TO SCHOOLS ARE SOMETIMES OUR POLICIES ARE ALMOST LIKE BACK AT A BUS KIND OF POLICIES- LIKE ROSA PARKS AND WHAT SHE DID DOESN'T MATTER WE STILL ARE DOING THINGS WHERE. IN MY DISTRICT. AN FORTY SIX AN ADULT. I SAW MORE MERCEDES LEXUS AND PEOPLE IN LAWN CHAIRS ORDING COOPER EACH TO GET VACCINATED THEY DIDN'T LIVE IN THE COMMUNITY. WHAT THE COMMUNITY IS LOOKING ALL OF WHAT'S GOING ON PEOPLE WERE JUMPING THE LINE. I JUST DON'T WANT THAT TO HAPPEN WITH OUR MOST PRECIOUS CARGO WHICH IS OUR KIDS. THAT ISRAEL DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES ARE PRESSED TO THE BACK ALIVE ECAUSE OTHERS HAVE IT HAVE MORE RESOURCES. THE ABILITY TO SEND THEIR KIDS TO PRIVATE SCHOOL DEBILITY SENT TO SCHOOLS THAT ARE ALREADY UP AND RUNNING. BUT WE'RE TRAPPED HERE- NOT PROVIDING ENOUGH RESOURCES. BUT MOST IMPORTANT IF THEY'RE NOT PUT TO THE FRONT. OF THE LINE YES WE NEED TO DO PUT WHERE THE HOT SPOTS ARE THE MOST DISADVANTAGED TO THE FRONT OF THE LINE AND THEN WE START TO TAKE CARE IT IS CRITICAL PROBLEM AND SO HOPEFULLY IN. THIS THEY ARE VOTING FOR CUTTING BEGINS THE PROCESS OF ACTUALLY FOCUSING IN DOWN EAST LA SOUTH LA AND THERE MIGHT. MY COLLEAGUE TO THE SOUTH ALSO MENTIONED- THE PROBLEMS THAT ARE HAPPENING THAT WE PRIOR TO RISE TO A COURT ORDER. WHERE MY NORTHERN CALI ME AND MY SOUTHERN KILEY. WE CAN GET TO RESEARCH SOURCES WE NEED TO MAKE SURE. WHEN THIS IS OVER WE'RE ALREADY BEHIND THINK ABOUT IT WE WERE ALREADY BEHIND. IF WE DON'T DO ANYTHING NOW WE COULD LOSE GENERATIONS AND GENERATIONS TO POVERTY. AND THINGS THAT WE THOUGHT WE WERE ON OUR WAY TO FOR THEM TO HAVE A BETTER LIFE SO THANK YOU MISTER. WELCOME BACK TO OUR ROSTER. SOME OF THE TABLE ACTION WILL COME FOR THANK YOU MR CHIU AND TO I THANK YOU ALL FOR THE- OF REMARKS THAT ALL OF YOU HAVE MADE I REPRESENT- A NUMBER OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS OF COURSE AS WELL- AND SOME OF MINOR BETTER OFF THAN OTHERS BUT ABOUT HALF OF MY CONSTITUENTS- OF ACCESO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT THE- FOR THEIR- CHILDREN. I AND I WANT TO JOIN MIKE WHO SPOKE SO L. ABOUT THE- IMPORTANCE OF- OF MAKING CERTAIN THAT WE DO NOT ALLOW CHILDREN TO FALL FURTHER BEHIND SIMPLY BECAUSE- OF WHERE THEY LIVE OR THE COLOR OF THEIR SKIN- OR ANY OF THE OTHER EQUITY FACTORS- THAT ARE IN. IN PLAY HERE WE SIMPLY CAN'T DO THAT LEASE- SUFFERS A SOCIETY- AND AS INDIVIDUALS. THE FURTHER THAT DIVIDE GROWS- IT'S REFLECTED IN FISHERS IN OUR SOCIETY- AND- IT WOULD BE OUTRAGEOUS IF THE ACTION THAT WE TAKE HERE TODAY- WERE TO FURTHER EXACERBATE THAT- I KNOW THAT NONE OF US WANT TO SEE THAT HAPPEN CERTAINLY NOT TO ART ARE CHAIR ANY OTHER MEMBER OF THIS COMMITTEE. ALL THE SUPPORTING. OF THIS BILL TODAY IS A STEP FORWARD- BUT I THINK IT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THAT WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR ITS IMPLEMENTATION. I THINK A LOT OF THE- PARENTS WHO ARE FOLLOWING THIS DEBATE- I THINK THAT WE ARE. JUST YOU KNOW HERE TO REOPEN SCHOOLS AND- YOU KNOW WE SHOULD FLIP A SWITCH AND THAT SHOULD HAPPEN AND THAT CLEARLY IS NOT WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE IT'S NOT PRACTICAL IT IS NOT 1100% ARE- WITHIN OUR JURISDICTION TO DO- HI. ADAM AND I. DO HAVE A QUESTION THAT'S RELATED TO THAT THOUGH- WE ARE- CURRENTLY TALKING ABOUT ONLY A FRACTION OF STUDENTS. WHO THROUGH OUR ACTION TODAY OR- WHEN THIS- PRESUMABLY PASSES- ON BOTH FLOORS OF THE LEGISLATURE- WILL BE INCENTIVIZED. TO THROUGH THEIR SCHOOL TO- TO RE OPEN FOR A SEGMENT SO IF YOU'RE IN THE PURPLE CARE IT'S- THE- COHORTS THAT ARE LISTED AND T. K. THROUGH TWO IF YOU'RE IN THE RED TEAR THAT INCREASES TO T. K. THROUGH SEX- AND- ONE GRADE. OF SEVEN THROUGH TWELVE. MIKE A QUESTION IS THAT THE- I THINK IT'S LAUDATORY OF THAT- WE ARE HOPEFULLY GOING TO BE SEEING- AND- IN THE VERY VERY NEAR FUTURE THOSE STUDENTS IN THOSE COHORTS RETURNING TO SCHOOL- BUT IT'S NOT ALL OF THE STUDENTS AND SO I MY QUESTION IS- WHAT IS THE PLAN. GOING FORWARD TO- ANNA AND IS THERE ANYTHING IN THE FOLDER PASSING TODAY THAT. SETS MOTION PLANNING FOR- NEXT STAGES. OF RETURN. YES THANK YOU SO THE- THERE ARE PLANS ACROSS STATE FOR LOCAL SCHOOLS AGO OBVIOUSLY- SENIOR OWN DISTRO THERE ARE MANY THAT ARE MUCH MORE PROGRESSIVE THAN THIS MINIMUM STANDARD THAT WE ARE SETTING IN THIS LEGISLATION. THIS LEGISLATION IS INTENDED TO ADDRESS THOSE SCHOOL DISTRICTS WHO HAVE NOT MADE PROGRESS TOWARDS EVEN A MINIMUM PHASE THREE OPENING APPROACH- AND HAVE REMAINED CLOSE TO HAVE PLANNED TO REMAIN CLOSE TO THE END OF THE SCHOOL YEAR. AND SO THAT IS THE FOCUS OF THIS LEGISLATION TODAY A DISTANCE LEARNING AUTHORITY DOES EXPIRE AT THE END OF THIS SCHOOL YEAR AND I KNOW THAT THE CHAIR HAS EXPRESSED IN THAT OF MANY MEMBERS HAVE HAVE EXPRESSED INCLUDING. SOME MEMBER O'DONNELL- IN INTENT TO NOT RE AUTHORIZE A BLANKET DISTANCE LEARNING AUTHORITY FOR THE NEXT SCHOOL YEAR SO THAT IF THAT WERE TO BE THE ACTION TAKEN IN JUNE AS PART OF THE BUDGET IT WOULD LEAD TO A MUCH MORE COMPREHENSIVE. RE OPENING OF SCHOOLS. SO ARE I ENTER. THE WHAT DO- JUST TOLD US- JUNE BY- IS THE TIME THAT WE WOULD- A PROVIDE FOR FURTHER INCENTIVES THE JUNE BUDGET WILL BE THE DETERMINING FACTOR IN TERMS OF WHAT SCHOOL LOOKS LIKE IN THE FALL SO THIS IS INTENDED TO BE FOCUSED ON SAFELY RE OPENING THIS SPRING ALONG. OKAY THANK YOU. MY QUESTION IS I GUESS- TO FOLLOW UP ON MY COLLEAGUES WITHIN A ROSE- I KNOW THAT THE BUDGET COMMITTEE STAFF PRESENTED AN ANSWER ON WHAT- WHAT SCHOOL WOULD LOOK LIKE AND HOW MANY HOURS WOULD BE- PROVIDED IN PERSON AND THAT WOULD BE UP TO- THE SCHOOL DISTRICT BY IF I COULD ASK THE BOMB OF FINANCES ADMINISTRATION HAVE A PREFERENCE OR DO THEY ENVISION AND A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF OR IN PERSON INSTRUCTION- THAT THAT THE GOVERNOR WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS WHAT ONE IS WANT TO SEE- IN SCHOOLS. I THINK WHAT WE WHAT WE WOULD LOOK AT THE GUIDANCE WE WOULD LOOK TO- CO WITH SAFETY PLANS- AND CERTAINLY- YOU KNOW WE ARE SUPPORTIVE OF THE LEGISLATION THAT IS BEFORE- THIS BODY. WHICH DOES PROVIDE FOR LOCAL DISCRETION IN DETERMINING THE MOST APPROPRIATE- YOU KNOW ACTION- FOR THEIR PARTICULAR SCHOOL DISTRICTS- AND HOW THEY WOULD IMPLEMENT THAT REAL. OKAY SO SEVEN AND S. OF THE- I MEAN THE MAN OF. AND PERSON STILL HAS TO BE WORKED OUT WITHIN THE SCHOOL DISTRICT AND THAT AND THAT'S HOW IT'S ENVISIONED. BOTH AIR AND DEPART FINANCE NOW THIS WOULD GO. SO DID. FOUR OF THE SITE HI ADDITION AS ABOUT THE SAME TIME AND GOT. I WOULD I WOULD JUST REITERATE THAT OF FINE OF REMOTE THE DIDN'T MINIMUM FLOOR FOR INSTRUCTIONAL MINUTES IN THE SPRING- REMAINS BUT THE- DIVISION BETWEEN IN PERSON AND ONLINE INSTRUCTION WOULD REMAIN LOCAL DECISION THROUGH THE SPRING. OKAY AND THEN- MAYBE YOU CAN CLARIFY I KNOW THE LIGHT- MY PUBLIC SECTOR BUT SINCE THERE'S SOME- AS A- HI MY AND IN CADENCES. CAN YOU JUST WALK ME THROUGH THAT- TESTING CADENCE AND WHAT ALLOWED SO IF YOU HAVE A SCHOOL DISTRICT IS- MOVING FORWARD WITH THEIR PLAN- ALREADY THEN THEY WOULD THEN BE GRANDFATHERED IN AND WOULD HAVE A TESTING CADENCE OF. ONCE EVERY TWO MONTHS AND THEN IT BUT IF THEY WORD TO- AND NOT IN AN OPEN UNDER THESE NEW GUIDANCE IS- AT BEFORE APRIL FIRST- THEN IF THERE IT DEPENDS ON THEIR TEARS OF THEIR IN THE RED HERE THEY WE TEST. EVERY WEEK AND THEN IF THERE AND- OF THAT AND THE RED IT HAS EVERY TWO WEEKS AND IF THEY'RE IN THE PURPLE THEY WOULD TEST EVERY. WEEK IS THAT CORRECT. SO THAT'S THE ONLY- TO CORRECT ME IF I GET THIS WRONG BUT- THE- THE TESTING CADENCES OF THE REQUIREMENTS IN THE PURPLE TIER. WOULD BE THE STATE REQUIREMENTS IF THEY HAVE NOT ADOPTED THEIR OWN LOCAL PLAN AROUND TESTING- BY MARCH THIRTY FIRST. SO THEN IF THEY ARE IN THE RED TEAR OR BETTER. IT IS A LOCAL TESTING CADENCE OF JUST NEED TO REPORT INTO THEIR COVERED SAFETY PLAN. SO THERE AT THE STATE DOES HAVE GUIDANCE THEY HAVE ADVICE BROWN TESTING CADENCES IN THE RED TEAR- FOR A SYMPTOMATIC TESTING AND THEN THEY HAVE. GOT REQUIREMENTS FOR TESTING RUN SYMPTOMATIC TESTING IN THE ORANGE TEARS AND BETTER. BUT THOSE WOULD REMAIN AS- GUIDANCE NOT A REQUIREMENT UNDER THIS BILL. THE DIFFERENCES THE PURPLE TEAR SO THE PURPLE TIER TESTING CADENCES. WHICH ARE- RECOMMENDED CURRENTLY BY THE DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH FOR A SYMPTOMATIC TESTING. OF TWICE WEEKLY FOR STAFF AND STUDENTS. IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A LOCAL PLAN PRIOR TO MARCH THIRTY FIRST THAT TESTING WOULD BE REQUIRED IN PURPLE. THE TWICE WITH IN THE- AND THAT ACTUALLY AS IT AND I SENT TO MY FINAL IN A IS TO THE- IN TERMS OF. I NOW AND WHAT IS WHAT IS YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON. ON THIS ON THIS BILL- IF YOU'VE A HAD A CHANCE TO DIGEST EVERYTHING.

THERE IS A WIDE RANGE OF COMFORT LEVEL AMONG PARENTS AND GUARDIANS ABOUT WHEN AND HOW THEIR CHILD RETURNS TO SCHOOL IN PERSON DURING THE ACT REQUIRES THE LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT EVEN WITH WHAT PROVIDE THE OPTION OF IN PERSON LEARNING STUDENTS HAVE THE RIGHT TO CONTINUE TO ACCESS TO QUALITY DISTANCE LEARNING IF THEY CHOOSE. THANK YOU TO THAT AND TO REINSTATE THE PROVISIONS REQUIRING DISTRICTS TO CERTIFY THAT EACH STUDENT PARTICIPATING IN DISTANCE LEARNING HAS WON THE ONE ACCESS TO A DEVICE OR AT HIGH SPEED INTERNET ACCESS.

ALL OF YOU SHOULD KNOW SINCE YOU'RE RUNNING CALIFORNIA I DIDN'T INVERTEBRATE IS THE OPPOSITE OF A VERTEBRATE AND INVERTEBRATE THERE'S A LIFE FORM WITHOUT A BACKBONE. NONE OF YOU HAVE ANY BACK BALANCE YOU ARE BLOCKED YOU ARE BOUGHT BY. TEACHERS UNIONS YOU ARE BOUGHT BY TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES YOU ARE BOUGHT BY THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY AND IN THE PROCESS YOU HAVE A LOCK YOU DOWN CALIFORNIA FOR A YEAR AND YES THIS LEGISLATURE IS RESPONSIBLE DESPITE THE FACT THAT THIS GOVERNOR. HAS BEEN RULING CALIFORNIA WITH AN IRON FIST YOU KNOW THE LEGISLATURE HAVE ABDICATED YOUR RESPONSIBILITY WHAT WE'RE SEEING IN NEW YORK. OUTCRIES AGAINST CUOMO TO IMPEACH HIM AND THAT IS THE BUSINESS YOU SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON NOW. INSTEAD YOU ARE LIKE TODDLERS IN A SAND PILE ARGUING WELL CHILDREN IN CALIFORNIA DIED WELL CHILDREN ARE KILLING THEMSELVES ONE FOSTER CHILDREN KILLING THEMSELVES AND YOU PEOPLE CAN'T GET THE SCHOOLS OPEN. IN THE MURDER BRICKS THAT'S THE WORD OF THE DAY NONE OF YOU HAVE ANY BACKBONE AND IT IS SHAMEFUL IT WAS SHAMEFUL IN SEPTEMBER OF NINETEEN WHEN YOU KICK FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND. THE KIDS OUT OF SCHOOL WHEN YOU. FORM A FASCIST LEGISLATION. SB TWO. NEXT TO HAVE A CALM FROM TWENTY FOUR TO YOUR LINE OF OPEN. GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THIS IS THEIR ECONOMIC ON BEHALF OF THE SASSER REPRESENTING THE FIFTY COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS. OUT WHAT WILL BRING IN THIS PROPOSAL TO OUR INTERNAL COMMITTEE FOR SUPPORT THIS AFTERNOON WE DID WANT TO EXPRESS HOW STRONG OF A PROPOSAL AND- FINAL LANDING THAT YOU MADE ON THE CONDITION OF THE PRIEST WITH THE LEGISLATURE. AND THE EDUCATIONAL STAFF AND THE LEGISLATURE FOR WORKING WITH US IN HEARING RESPONDS TO THE CONCERNS BROUGHT BY SCHOOL. LEADERS ON BALANCE. WE THINK THE PLAN DELIVERS RESOURCE THAT WE TO MORE SO AND PER. WELL REMOVED THE BARRIERS THAT. SO DOWN PROCESS. SO WE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TREMENDOUS WORK ON. THESE TWO BILLS THANK YOU. NEXT WE'RE GOING TO LINE TWENTY FIVE TO FIVE YOUR LINE IS OPEN. HELLO THIS IS ROBERT MENTORING FROM CHILDREN NOW FOR SMALL WANTED TO- IT GALLAGHER APPRECIATION FOR THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR'S EFFORT ON REOPENING SCHOOLS AND PROVIDING MONEY TO ACCELERATE- THAT PROCESS. AND FOR ADJUSTING LEARNING A LOT IN THE SUMMER- IN THE OFFICE AND WE ALSO WANTED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE PROGRESS MADE TO INCLUDE ENGLISH LEARNERS AS A PRIORITY GROUP WE WANT TO MAKE THREE POINTS- THAT WE THINK- IN TERMS OF CLEAN UP LEGISLATION THAT YOU MAY WANT TO CONSIDER. FIRST IS AROUND PARENT CHOICE- WE BELIEVE THAT PARENTS SHOULD HAVE THE CHOICE TO CONTINUE DISTANCE LEARNING YEAH THAT IS WHAT THEY THINK IS AN THEIR CHILD'S BEST INTEREST EITHER BECAUSE THE STUDENT HAS SOME. REAL HEALTH RISK FACTOR- OR THEY JUST SIMPLY DON'T FEEL SAFE GOING BACK WE KNOW THAT THIS PANDEMIC AND DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AND SO GIVING THOSE PARETS THE CHOICE IF THEY'RE NOT READY TO TAKE THE KIDS BACK- FOR IN PERSON INSTRUCTION.
