BILL I AGREE WITH THE MEMBER OF

00:40:16.313 --> 00:40:17.848
THE BILL IS VERY SIMPLE IT

00:40:17.915 --> 00:40:19.450
CREATES AN ARBITRARY FORMULA.

00:40:19.517 --> 00:40:20.684
THAT SAYS YOU HAVE TO TAKE A

00:40:20.751 --> 00:40:22.319
CERTAIN AMOUNT OF REVENUE FROM

00:40:22.386 --> 00:40:24.088
CERTAIN BUCKETS OF MONEY IT DOES

00:40:24.155 --> 00:40:25.389
NOTHING IT HAS NOTHING TO DO

00:40:25.456 --> 00:40:26.590
WITH SCHOOL PERFORMANCE HAS

00:40:26.657 --> 00:40:27.858
NOTHING TO DO WITH GRADUATION

00:40:27.925 --> 00:40:28.893
RATES HAS NOTHING DO WITH

00:40:28.959 --> 00:40:30.294
PLACEMENT RATES IT'S SIMPLY IS

00:40:30.361 --> 00:40:32.696
AN ARBITRARY FORMULA THAT SAYS.

00:40:32.763 --> 00:40:34.932
WHERE YOUR TUITION COMES FROM

00:40:34.999 --> 00:40:36.901
HAS TO BE THESE POTS OF MONEY --

00:40:36.967 --> 00:40:38.002
FOR INSTANCE IS SCHOOL COULD

00:40:38.068 --> 00:40:39.537
HAVE LOW TUITION AND HIGH

00:40:39.603 --> 00:40:40.604
GRADUATION RATE.

00:40:40.671 --> 00:40:42.139
SAME PROGRAM NEXT DOOR COULD

00:40:42.206 --> 00:40:43.707
HAVE HI TUITION AND LOW

00:40:43.774 --> 00:40:45.843
GRADUATION RATE THE HIGH TUITION

00:40:45.910 --> 00:40:47.411
SCHOOL WILL QUALIFY UNDER THE

00:40:47.478 --> 00:40:48.813
BILL BECAUSE THEY'LL HAVE THE

00:40:48.879 --> 00:40:51.782
MARGIN OF ERROR -- TO MEET THE

00:40:51.849 --> 00:40:52.383
EIGHTY FIVE FIFTEEN WHERE THE

00:40:52.449 --> 00:40:53.851
LOW TUITION SCHOOL WILL NOT

00:40:53.918 --> 00:40:55.753
BECAUSE WE CAN'T CONTROL HOW

00:40:55.820 --> 00:40:57.254
MUCH DEBT STUDENTS COME TO OUR

00:40:57.321 --> 00:40:59.423
SCHOOL WITH WE CAN CONTROL THE

00:40:59.490 --> 00:41:00.191
TUITION.

00:41:00.257 --> 00:41:01.792
BUT IF THEY HAVE THE MAXIMUM

00:41:01.859 --> 00:41:03.194
ALLOWED UNDER FEDERAL LAW THEY

00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:04.695

00:41:04.762 --> 00:41:05.729
THE PROGRAM.

00:41:05.796 --> 00:41:08.065

01:01:03.292 --> 01:01:04.927
ALLOWS REGULATORS TO GO AFTER

01:01:04.994 --> 01:01:06.295

FEDERAL LAW AND THE COURTS FOUND

01:15:18.680 --> 01:15:20.716
THAT THE ORIGINAL GAME PLAN

ON GOING.

01:23:27.001 --> 01:23:28.470
SOME FURTHER EXAMPLES ARE THAT

01:23:28.536 --> 01:23:30.105
BLACK AND HISPANIC PATIENTS ARE

01:23:30.171 --> 01:23:32.240

CONTRIBUTE TO UNDER TREATMENT

01:24:15.517 --> 01:24:16.484
THE PARADOX WITH UNCONSCIOUS

01:24:16.551 --> 01:24:17.552
BIAS IS THAT THE THINGS THAT

01:24:17.619 --> 01:24:19.087

OUR PERSONAL VALUES.

01:24:22.524 --> 01:24:23.758
THIS MEANS IT'S NOT NECESSARILY

01:24:23.825 --> 01:24:25.460
A GROUP OF BAD PROVIDERS WHO ARE

01:24:25.527 --> 01:24:26.528
RESPONSIBLE FOR HEALTH

DISPARITIES.

01:24:27.495 --> 01:24:28.863
RATHER IT IS LIKELY THAT IT IS A

STANDARDIZE CARE.

01:24:38.540 --> 01:24:40.108
THIS MOST LIKELY HAPPENS WHEN

ABSOLUTELYEXTRAORDINARY

01:25:14.909 --> 01:25:16.511
DISCOVERY THAT THERE ARE NARAL

01:25:16.578 --> 01:25:18.379
SCIENTIFIC COR LET'S THAT WE CAN

HOW DECISIONS WILL BE MADE --

01:25:22.717 --> 01:25:24.219
AND WHAT IS EVEN MORE IMPORTANT

01:25:24.285 --> 01:25:25.286
IS THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO

01:25:25.353 --> 01:25:27.455
IDENTIFY SPECIFIC INTERVENTIONS

01:25:27.522 --> 01:25:28.957
THEY CAN BE COMMUNICATED THROUGH

01:25:29.023 --> 01:25:30.525
TRAINING THAT WILL LOWER ONCE

01:25:30.592 --> 01:25:33.561
LEVEL OF IMPLICIT BIAS

01:25:33.628 --> 01:25:34.562
SPECIFICALLY.

01:25:34.629 --> 01:25:35.129
IT WILL CHANGE THE KNURLED

01:25:35.196 --> 01:25:36.498
PHYSIOLOGICAL REACTIONS OF THE

01:25:36.564 --> 01:25:38.299

THEIR DECISIONS IN THE FACE OF

01:25:39.868 --> 01:25:40.935
BIAS.

01:25:41.002 --> 01:25:43.171
AND THAT WILL LOWER SPECIFIC OF

01:25:43.238 --> 01:25:44.939
NEURAL PHYSIOLOGIC REACTIONS

01:25:45.006 --> 01:25:46.674

01:25:55.517 --> 01:25:56.951
BE MORE LIKELY TO ACT THE WHEN

ONE QUESTION AND A COMMENT.

01:42:09.690 --> 01:42:12.292
AND MY QUESTION IS CAL --

01:42:12.359 --> 01:42:14.695
COLORADO OREGON AND WASHINGTON I

01:42:14.761 --> 01:42:16.497
BELIEVE HAVE LOWER RATES THAN WE

01:42:16.563 --> 01:42:18.532
CURRENTLY DO A D. AND I

01:42:18.599 --> 01:42:19.533
APOLOGIZE IF I MISSED THIS

01:42:19.600 --> 01:42:20.801
BECAUSE I CAME IN HALFWAY

01:42:20.868 --> 01:42:22.336
THROUGH THE PRESENTATION BUT

01:42:22.402 --> 01:42:27.274
WELL WHAT ARE THEIR TAX RATES ON

01:42:27.341 --> 01:42:29.776
A LEGAL CANNABIS RIGHT NOW.

01:42:29.843 --> 01:42:30.344
AND MAYBE ONE THE WITNESSES

01:42:30.410 --> 01:42:31.945
COULD ANSWER.

01:42:32.012 --> 01:42:32.513
THEY ARE LOWER -- IT BUT NOT

01:42:32.579 --> 01:42:33.146
SIGNIFICANTLY I THINK COLORADO

01:42:33.213 --> 01:42:34.481
IS AROUND -- TWELVE AT THEIR ALL

01:42:34.548 --> 01:42:37.384
OVER 10% AND SO ON AT LEAST WITH

01:42:37.451 --> 01:42:38.585
THAT THE REDUCTION OF THE

01:42:38.652 --> 01:42:40.120
CULTIVATION TAX THAT WOULD ONLY

01:42:40.187 --> 01:42:41.455
BE A TEMPORARY.

01:42:41.522 --> 01:42:43.390
ON SO THAT WOULD BE A COMPLETE

01:42:43.457 --> 01:42:45.058
REDUCTION FROM MY UNDERSTANDING

01:42:45.125 --> 01:42:46.860
OKAY BUT THEY ARE THOSE THREE

01:42:46.927 --> 01:42:49.596
STATES ARE PRESENTLY HAVE LOWER

01:42:49.663 --> 01:42:50.330
RATES THAN WE HAVE.

01:42:50.397 --> 01:42:51.632
ABSENT THIS BILL.

01:42:51.698 --> 01:42:53.867
IS THAT CORRECT.

01:42:53.934 --> 01:42:54.801
OKAY.

01:42:54.868 --> 01:42:56.036
YES IT'S DEFINITELY TO RECOGNIZE

01:42:56.103 --> 01:42:57.137
THE INFORMATION.

01:42:57.204 --> 01:42:58.338

01:42:58.405 --> 01:43:00.274
YOU KNOW COMMENT WAS.

01:43:00.340 --> 01:43:02.042
WE HAVE A BLACK MARKET PROBLEM

01:43:02.109 --> 01:43:03.577
IN THIS INDUSTRY I MEAN THAT'S

01:43:03.644 --> 01:43:05.913
ON UNDENIABLE I AGREE WITH MY

01:43:05.979 --> 01:43:08.081
COLLEAGUE'S COMMENTS ON THAT --

01:43:08.148 --> 01:43:10.384
I DO BELIEVE LOWERING THE TAX

01:43:10.450 --> 01:43:13.220
RATE ON A TEMPORARY BASIS -- TO

01:43:13.287 --> 01:43:14.588
AND AND STUDYING IT AND I LIKE

01:43:14.655 --> 01:43:15.622
THE FACT THAT WE HAVE STUDY

01:43:15.689 --> 01:43:17.190
PROVISIONS LET'S LET'S WHICH WE

01:43:17.257 --> 01:43:18.091
SHOULD DO THAT MORE IN THIS

01:43:18.158 --> 01:43:19.493
BUILDING LET'S DO SOMETHING

01:43:19.560 --> 01:43:20.761
TEMPORARILY.

01:43:20.827 --> 01:43:22.362
ON A PILOT OUR TESTER TRIAL

01:43:22.429 --> 01:43:24.431
BASIS GO DO SOME RESEARCH AND

01:43:24.498 --> 01:43:26.033
FIGURE FIGURE OUT WHETHER IT'S

01:43:26.099 --> 01:43:27.067
WORKING TO THE BEST OF OUR

01:43:27.134 --> 01:43:28.302
KNOWLEDGE AND THAT'S THE

01:43:28.368 --> 01:43:29.102
APPROACH THIS BILL TAKES I THINK

01:43:29.169 --> 01:43:31.538
THAT'S THAT'S VERY WISE I THINK

01:43:31.605 --> 01:43:33.640
TAXATION IS PART OF THE BLACK

01:43:33.707 --> 01:43:35.142
MARKET PROBLEM.

01:43:35.208 --> 01:43:35.909
I DON'T THINK IT'S ALL OF IT I

01:43:35.976 --> 01:43:36.944
THINK THE LICENSING AND

01:43:37.010 --> 01:43:38.612
REGULATION.

01:43:38.679 --> 01:43:39.680
THE REGULATORY SCHEME IF YOU

01:43:39.746 --> 01:43:42.015
WILL -- NEEDS.

01:43:42.082 --> 01:43:43.817
TO PERHAPS BE ANALYZED TO SEE

01:43:43.884 --> 01:43:45.352
WHETHER WE'RE MAKING THAT

01:43:45.419 --> 01:43:46.853
OPTIMALLY EFFICIENT.

01:43:46.920 --> 01:43:48.922
AND I KNOW THAT'S OUTSIDE THE

01:43:48.989 --> 01:43:50.090
SCOPE OF WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE

MODERNIZE THE PROGRAM IN TERMS

01:54:22.188 --> 01:54:22.889
THE EFFICIENCY OF OBTAINING A

01:54:22.956 --> 01:54:24.791
PERMIT BUT WE BELIEVE IN THE

01:54:24.857 --> 01:54:26.459
PERMIT AND THE PROCESS ITSELF --

01:54:26.526 --> 01:54:27.794
IT DOES.

01:54:27.860 --> 01:54:29.028
EMPHASIZE RADIATION DOSE

01:54:29.095 --> 01:54:31.664
FEDERATION SAFETY WAS DEVELOPED

STANDARDIZES IT.

01:54:38.471 --> 01:54:40.607
MAKES THE PERMIT PORTABLE SO THE

01:54:40.673 --> 01:54:42.141
POSITIONAL PAINS THAT PERMIT CAN

01:54:42.208 --> 01:54:44.510
WORK IN MULTIPLE HOSPITALS -- WE

01:54:44.577 --> 01:54:47.280
THINK THE TEST IS A AFFECTED AND

01:54:47.347 --> 01:54:48.815
HAS BEEN UPDATED -- SEVERAL

01:54:48.881 --> 01:54:51.417
YEARS AGO THE PASS RATE IS 83%

01:54:51.484 --> 01:54:52.485
SO CERTAIN CERTAINLY THE TEST IS

01:54:52.552 --> 01:54:54.621
NOT AN IMPEDIMENT IN ITSELF TO

01:54:54.687 --> 01:54:55.688
OBTAIN A PERMIT.

01:54:55.755 --> 01:54:56.823

OUR REGULATIONS CURRENTLY DO

01:55:24.717 --> 01:55:26.853
JUST THAT THEY REQUIRE EVIDENCE

RADIATION KNOWLEDGE TO TESTING

01:55:28.254 --> 01:55:29.756

TO THE PASS RATE FOR LICENSE

01:55:51.377 --> 01:55:52.912
IT'S AS LOW PROVING THE POINT

01:55:52.979 --> 01:55:54.314
THAT MORE EDUCATION IS NEEDED

01:55:54.380 --> 01:55:55.315
NOT LESS.

01:55:55.381 --> 01:55:56.716
THE FACT IS THAT AN OPERATOR WHO

THERE'S IT'S A HUGE BLACK MARKET

02:31:11.395 --> 02:31:12.663
SO WHAT WE WANTED WAS TO

02:31:12.730 --> 02:31:14.432
LEGALIZE IT BRING IT OUT OF THE

02:31:14.498 --> 02:31:15.299

TOWARDS THE FLOOR SWEEPING IT'S

02:31:28.112 --> 02:31:30.080
MORE THESE THINGS RESULT AFTER

02:31:30.147 --> 02:31:32.283
FOUR ABSOLUTELY AND WE CONTINUE --

02:31:32.349 --> 02:31:34.285
TO WANT TO WORK AND DISCUSS WHAT

02:31:34.351 --> 02:31:37.021

CHIANG FOR A FOR THIS

02:31:42.326 --> 02:31:44.361
LEGISLATION FOLLOWING UP ON MY

02:31:44.428 --> 02:31:44.795
COLLEAGUES I STILL.

02:31:44.862 --> 02:31:46.130
AM TRYING TO SUSS OUT THE

02:31:46.197 --> 02:31:47.832
DIFFERENCE SO THAT THE THE

02:31:47.898 --> 02:31:49.266
TRIGGER FOR WEATHER ON A LOCAL

02:31:49.333 --> 02:31:50.701
JURISDICTION WOULD HAVE TO TAKE

02:31:50.768 --> 02:31:52.236
A LOOK TO COLLECTIVE ACTION.

02:31:52.303 --> 02:31:53.704
ON IS WHETHER OR NOT A MAJORITY

02:31:53.771 --> 02:31:55.439
VOTED FOR PROP SIXTY FOUR WHAT

02:31:55.506 --> 02:31:56.874
WAS A WHICH WAS ABOUT A DAHLE

02:31:56.941 --> 02:31:58.409
USE OF CANNABIS.

02:31:58.476 --> 02:32:00.277
OF BUT THE LEGISLATION IN ITS

02:32:00.344 --> 02:32:02.012
CURRENT FORMATION IS AROUND

02:32:02.079 --> 02:32:07.485
MEDICINAL USE AND I'M CONFUSED

02:32:07.551 --> 02:32:10.287
ABOUT THAT THAT.

02:32:10.354 --> 02:32:11.589
CONTRAST I THINK IT'S I THINK

02:32:11.655 --> 02:32:12.590
THAT THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION --

02:32:12.656 --> 02:32:13.724
GOING THROUGH A DISCUSSION WITH

02:32:13.791 --> 02:32:17.061
THE COMMITTEE I I THINK -- THE

02:32:17.127 --> 02:32:18.429
COMMITTEE SENSE WAS THAT HE WAS

02:32:18.496 --> 02:32:21.131
BY BETTER TO MAKE THE BILL MORE

02:32:21.198 --> 02:32:22.533
NARROW.

02:32:22.600 --> 02:32:25.269
AND MAKE IT FRANKLY -- SORT OF

02:32:25.336 --> 02:32:30.307
EASIER -- TO TO ILL TO YOU KNOW

02:32:30.374 --> 02:32:31.842
WHY A WIDER VARIETY IF YOU KNOW

02:32:31.909 --> 02:32:34.078
MEMBERS SO YEAH WE WE DECIDED TO

02:32:34.144 --> 02:32:36.013
MOVE IN THAT DIRECTION OKAY.

02:32:36.080 --> 02:32:38.682
AND WITH REGARD TO SOME OF THE

02:32:38.749 --> 02:32:39.617
AMENDMENTS THAT WERE TAKEN I

02:32:39.683 --> 02:32:41.719
THINK THE NARROWING ADDITIONALLY

02:32:41.785 --> 02:32:42.887
FOR COMMUNITIES ACTUALLY HAVE

02:32:42.953 --> 02:32:45.489
TAKEN THIS SORT OF VOTE -- IS

02:32:45.556 --> 02:32:47.725
APPROPRIATE -- GIVEN THAT YOUR

02:32:47.791 --> 02:32:49.693
BEARD YOUR TIME IS TO SIXTY FOUR

02:32:49.760 --> 02:32:51.595
THERE ARE JURISDICTIONS THAT

02:32:51.662 --> 02:32:52.830
HAVE -- LOOKED AT THIS.

02:32:52.897 --> 02:32:53.898
BY PRISON POSITIVELY AND

02:32:53.964 --> 02:32:55.866
NEGATIVELY -- AND SO EXEMPTING

02:32:55.933 --> 02:32:57.835
THEM SEEMS TO MAKE A GOOD DEAL

02:32:57.902 --> 02:33:00.204
OF SENSE I DO PUSH BACK ON THE

02:33:00.271 --> 02:33:01.639
SUGGESTION THAT.

02:33:01.705 --> 02:33:03.007
LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ARE ARE

02:33:03.073 --> 02:33:05.142
EMBRACING THIS OCCURS IN IN MY

02:33:05.209 --> 02:33:06.710
COUNTY THAT ISN'T REALLY THE

02:33:06.777 --> 02:33:09.413
CASE -- I I DON'T KNOW THE EXACT

02:33:09.480 --> 02:33:10.414
NUMBER OF TIME AHEAD OF OF

02:33:10.481 --> 02:33:12.383
CITIES -- IN THE COUNTY SAN

02:33:12.449 --> 02:33:14.318
DIEGO WE HAVE EIGHTEEN I THINK A

02:33:14.385 --> 02:33:15.986
SMALL MINORITY ACTUALLY HAVE ANY

02:33:16.053 --> 02:33:16.921
KIND OF AT THE MEET AND ABLY

02:33:16.987 --> 02:33:18.889
LEGISLATION ON IT.

02:33:18.956 --> 02:33:19.356
THE COUNTY HAS A VERY

02:33:19.423 --> 02:33:21.692
RESTRICTIVE -- LEGISLATION

02:33:21.759 --> 02:33:22.593
AROUND IT AND SO AS A

02:33:22.660 --> 02:33:24.795
CONSEQUENCE ACCESS IS CERTAINLY

02:33:24.862 --> 02:33:25.829
CURTAILED BY THINK FOR

02:33:25.896 --> 02:33:26.497
JURISDICTIONS LIKE THE CITY OF

02:33:26.564 --> 02:33:28.198
SAN DIEGO WHO STEPPED UP AND

02:33:28.265 --> 02:33:29.700
ACTUALLY PASSED AN ORDINANCE.

02:33:29.767 --> 02:33:31.669
EMILY VERY RESTRAINED -- BUT THE

02:33:31.735 --> 02:33:34.238
END RESULT IS ONE WHERE THEY'RE

02:33:34.305 --> 02:33:35.940
DEALING WITH THE IMPACTS.

02:33:36.006 --> 02:33:38.342
OF THE RETAIL ESTABLISHMENTS --

02:33:38.409 --> 02:33:39.843
WHILE OTHER JURISDICTIONS --

02:33:39.910 --> 02:33:41.111
DON'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT --

02:33:41.178 --> 02:33:42.446
AND SO THERE'S AN EQUITY HERE

02:33:42.513 --> 02:33:43.981
THAT I THINK IS IMPORTANT I

02:33:44.048 --> 02:33:44.848
THINK ONE OF THE CONCERNS I

02:33:44.915 --> 02:33:46.183
WOULD HAVE IS THE NUMBERS THAT

02:33:46.250 --> 02:33:47.351
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

02:33:47.418 --> 02:33:48.819
IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT 25%

02:33:48.886 --> 02:33:50.721
FIGURE WHICH IS A BIG CONCERN TO

02:33:50.788 --> 02:33:53.657
ME JUST ON THE TOP LINE -- FIRST

02:33:53.724 --> 02:33:54.959
OF THE 20% OF GENERAL SALES

02:33:55.025 --> 02:33:56.460
PERMIT SO IT'S NOT EVERY

02:33:56.527 --> 02:33:58.529
RESTAURANT EVERY BAR EVERY

02:33:58.596 --> 02:34:00.598
LIQUOR STORE ON EVERY GENERAL

02:34:00.664 --> 02:34:01.699
MERCHANDISE DEPARTMENT STORE

02:34:01.765 --> 02:34:08.005
THAT SELLS LIQUOR IT'S JUST

02:34:08.072 --> 02:34:09.073
LIQUOR STORES.

02:34:09.139 --> 02:34:10.174
THAT KIND OF PERMIT RIGHT TO THE

02:34:10.240 --> 02:34:11.375
25%OFF OF THE NUMBER THAT'S

02:34:11.442 --> 02:34:11.942
PROBABLY FAR LESS THAN WHAT

02:34:12.009 --> 02:34:14.311
PEOPLE THINK CORRECT BY QUARTER

02:34:14.378 --> 02:34:14.912
LOOK THINK OF THE LAST QUARTER

02:34:14.979 --> 02:34:15.546
LIQUOR STORES IN AND THERE'S A

02:34:15.613 --> 02:34:16.180
NUMBER OF FILTERS THAT YOU'VE

02:34:16.246 --> 02:34:16.814
PUT THIS THROUGH IN ORDER RIDE

02:34:16.880 --> 02:34:17.648
IN A FINAL FIGURE SEVEN SPEAKING.

02:34:17.715 --> 02:34:18.649
WITH SOME OF THE BILL PROPONENTS

02:34:18.716 --> 02:34:19.683
BUT WE SHARED WITH ME IS IT A

02:34:19.750 --> 02:34:20.317
CITY LIKE SELANNE BEACH AND MY

02:34:20.384 --> 02:34:22.820
ASSEMBLY DISTRICT THAT HAS OVER

02:34:22.886 --> 02:34:23.754
THIRTEEN THOUSAND PEOPLE UP WHAT

02:34:23.821 --> 02:34:25.789
HAS FORTY LIQUOR LICENSES UNDER

02:34:25.856 --> 02:34:26.423
YOUR BILL IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING

02:34:26.490 --> 02:34:29.560
THAT ONLY -- ONE CAMPUS RETAIL

02:34:29.627 --> 02:34:30.561
LICENSE WOULD BE ISSUED IN A

02:34:30.628 --> 02:34:32.029
CITY OF THAT NATURE THAT THAT'S

02:34:32.096 --> 02:34:33.530
RIGHT YEAH BECAUSE THE BILL ALSO

02:34:33.597 --> 02:34:34.598
SET THE FEELING.

02:34:34.665 --> 02:34:37.635
OF ONE LICENSE PER TEN THOUSAND

02:34:37.701 --> 02:34:38.769
PEOPLE.

02:34:38.836 --> 02:34:40.871
SO WHAT WHICHEVER SMALL AND SO

02:34:40.938 --> 02:34:42.239
IT WENT AYE NEGATIVELY THEY'LL

02:34:42.306 --> 02:34:43.774
BE NEW STORIES WRITTEN ABOUT

02:34:43.841 --> 02:34:44.908
THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION.

02:34:44.975 --> 02:34:47.611
ANYONE WHO RUSHES TO SAY 25% OF

02:34:47.678 --> 02:34:48.779
IN THE CASES LONG BEACH THE

02:34:48.846 --> 02:34:50.981
FORTY LIQUOR LICENSES -- NOT

02:34:51.048 --> 02:34:52.116
SUPER GREAT ON MATH BAG EVEN

02:34:52.182 --> 02:34:53.684
THAT WHEN I CAN DO -- FOURTEEN

02:34:53.751 --> 02:34:56.353
WE TELL LICENSES MEANS TEN

02:34:56.420 --> 02:34:57.488
DISPENSARIES OR TEN WE TELL

02:34:57.554 --> 02:34:58.555
ESTABLISHMENT BUT THAT'S NOT

02:34:58.622 --> 02:35:00.457
WHAT YOUR BILL DOES IN THIS

02:35:00.524 --> 02:35:01.525
PARTICULAR CASE OF THIS ONE MOST.

02:35:01.592 --> 02:35:03.894
COASTAL CITY IT WOULD BE -- ONE

02:35:03.961 --> 02:35:04.995
AGAIN INFORMATION PROVIDED ME IS

02:35:05.062 --> 02:35:06.030
THAT THE DEL MAR AND EVEN

02:35:06.096 --> 02:35:08.832
SMALLER CITY WOULD STILL JUST BE.

02:35:08.899 --> 02:35:09.600
ONE THAT'S RIGHT AND IN THAT'S

02:35:09.667 --> 02:35:10.801
IN CONTRAST TO THE ZERO THAT

02:35:10.868 --> 02:35:12.102
BOTH OF THOSE CITIES CURRENTLY

02:35:12.169 --> 02:35:13.737
HAVE WHICH COULD SEE YOUR POINT

02:35:13.804 --> 02:35:15.105
ABOUT WHO ACTUALLY IS HAVING

02:35:15.172 --> 02:35:16.373
ACCESS THAT'S RIGHT AND I THINK

02:35:16.440 --> 02:35:17.941
I THINK MY CITY SAN FRANCISCO'S

02:35:18.008 --> 02:35:20.511
FACING SIMILAR -- SITUATION TO

02:35:20.577 --> 02:35:22.613
YOUR CITY OF SAN DIEGO WHERE ARE

02:35:22.680 --> 02:35:24.682
WE HAVE BEEN SORT OF EARLY

02:35:24.748 --> 02:35:25.949
ADOPTERS I'VE MISSED MEDICINAL

02:35:26.016 --> 02:35:27.918
AND RECREATIONAL UNFORTUNATELY

02:35:27.985 --> 02:35:29.486
THE SURROUNDING CITIES IN THE

02:35:29.553 --> 02:35:31.321
BAY AREA HAVEN'T REALLY FOLLOWED

02:35:31.388 --> 02:35:32.489
SUIT SO THEN.

02:35:32.556 --> 02:35:35.092
IT REALLY ENCOURAGES EVERYBODY

02:35:35.159 --> 02:35:36.794
TO COME INTO SAN FRANCISCO JUST

02:35:36.860 --> 02:35:38.162
TO PURCHASE CANNABIS AND WHAT

02:35:38.228 --> 02:35:39.697
WE'D LIKE TO SEE IS JUST A

02:35:39.763 --> 02:35:41.532
SLIGHTLY MORE EVEN DISTRIBUTION

02:35:41.598 --> 02:35:42.666
THROUGHOUT THE STATE.

02:35:42.733 --> 02:35:44.201
IN IN THAT RESONATES FOR ME

02:35:44.268 --> 02:35:46.470
AGAIN WAS OF SHARON -- THE CITY

02:35:46.537 --> 02:35:47.071
SAN DIEGO THE CITY THE PILL

02:35:47.137 --> 02:35:48.238
BEACH I THINK OF TAKING ACTIONS

02:35:48.305 --> 02:35:49.640
BUT THAT'S TWO OF THE FIVE

02:35:49.707 --> 02:35:50.874
CITIES I REPRESENT OF THE BOUNCE

02:35:50.941 --> 02:35:52.242
OF WHICH NOT TAKEN ANY SPECIFIC

02:35:52.309 --> 02:35:53.777
ACTION AND WHILE THIS FEELS

02:35:53.844 --> 02:35:55.713
AGGRESSIVE -- I RECOGNIZE THAT

02:35:55.779 --> 02:35:56.714
WE'RE DEALING WITH A VERY

02:35:56.780 --> 02:35:58.182
SIGNIFICANT BLACK MARKET AND I

02:35:58.248 --> 02:35:58.849
DON'T BELIEVE THERE SHOULD BE A

02:35:58.916 --> 02:36:00.284
MEMBER OF THE LEGISLATURE THAT

02:36:00.350 --> 02:36:02.286
WOULD STAND BY ENABLE OR ASSIST

02:36:02.352 --> 02:36:10.828
THE BLACK MARKET TO CONTINUE TO

02:36:10.894 --> 02:36:11.762
EXIST -- WHETHER THAT'S THE

02:36:11.829 --> 02:36:12.463
NEGATIVE IMPACTS THAT

02:36:12.529 --> 02:36:13.263
UNDOUBTEDLY HAS IN YOUR DISTRICT

02:36:13.330 --> 02:36:14.598
IN MINING DISTRICTS ACROSS THE

02:36:14.665 --> 02:36:15.666
STATE OR TO THE SAID THAT IT

02:36:15.733 --> 02:36:16.600
UNDERMINES THE WORK OF OF

02:36:16.667 --> 02:36:17.201
LEGITIMATE OPERATORS ARE GOING

02:36:17.267 --> 02:36:17.801
TO THE REGULATORY PROCESS. TO

02:36:17.868 --> 02:36:18.435
ACTUALLY TRYING TO COMPLY WITH

02:36:18.502 --> 02:36:19.470
THE LAW -- I THINK THAT WE

02:36:19.536 --> 02:36:20.037
SHOULD BE IN THE BUSINESS OF

02:36:20.104 --> 02:36:20.704
TRYING TO HELP THAT I'M NOT SURE

02:36:20.771 --> 02:36:21.338
IF THIS BILL IS PERFECT IN ITS

02:36:21.405 --> 02:36:22.506
CURRENT FORM -- BUT I CERTAINLY

02:36:22.573 --> 02:36:23.607
TRUST YOU MISTER TING TO

02:36:23.674 --> 02:36:25.209
CONTINUE TO BE A DECENT STEWARD

02:36:25.275 --> 02:36:26.977
OF OF THIS KIND OF IDEA CONTINUE

02:36:27.044 --> 02:36:28.946
TO FIND IT AGAIN LOOK AT THE

02:36:29.012 --> 02:36:30.080
PERCENTAGE IN WONDER -- HOW

02:36:30.147 --> 02:36:32.483
UNNECESSARY THAT MIGHT BE -- BUT

02:36:32.549 --> 02:36:34.518
THE THE MMC TAKEN TODAY I AM I

02:36:34.585 --> 02:36:35.819
THINK OUR STEP IN THE RIGHT

02:36:35.886 --> 02:36:37.521
DIRECTION I WAS WITH BILL TODAY

02:36:37.588 --> 02:36:38.989
THEY AND AGAIN WE'RE HAPPY TO

02:36:39.056 --> 02:36:40.858
AGAIN REFINED THE PERCENTAGE --

02:36:40.924 --> 02:36:42.493
THE OTHER PART IS THE YOU KNOW

02:36:42.559 --> 02:36:44.094
MY PERSONAL CONCERN IS THAT IF

02:36:44.161 --> 02:36:45.729
WE DON'T SUPPORT.

02:36:45.796 --> 02:36:48.599
THE LICENSED -- LICENSED

02:36:48.665 --> 02:36:50.434
OPERATORS RIGHT NOW WE ARE

02:36:50.501 --> 02:36:52.002
POTENTIALLY PUTTING THEM AT RISK

02:36:52.069 --> 02:36:53.270
OF BEING PUT OUT OF BUSINESS AND

02:36:53.337 --> 02:36:54.071
THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE'VE BEEN

02:36:54.138 --> 02:36:55.405
HEARING WHICH WOULD MAKE IT A

02:36:55.472 --> 02:36:56.974
PERMANENT BLACK MARKET WHICH

02:36:57.040 --> 02:37:01.145
WOULD REALLY -- MOVE US IN THE

02:37:01.211 --> 02:37:01.745
WRONG DIRECTION THANK YOU VERY

02:37:01.812 --> 02:37:02.880
MUCH.

02:37:02.946 --> 02:37:03.981
ASSEMBLY WOMAN QUIRK SILVA

02:37:04.047 --> 02:37:05.082
FOLLOWED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER

02:37:05.149 --> 02:37:07.651
CHRIS -- THANK YOU MISTER

02:37:07.718 --> 02:37:08.919
ASSEMBLY MEMBER TING I

02:37:08.986 --> 02:37:11.255
APPRECIATE YOUR WORKING ON THIS

02:37:11.321 --> 02:37:12.689
BILL AND I'M GONNA SUPPORT IT

02:37:12.756 --> 02:37:14.825
TODAY BUT IT AS WAS MENTIONED

02:37:14.892 --> 02:37:16.727
SOME OF OUR COMMUNITIES -- WHEN

02:37:16.794 --> 02:37:18.228
WE REALLY LOOK AT THE DATA WE

02:37:18.295 --> 02:37:20.864
SEE QUITE A SPLIT ON NOT ONLY

02:37:20.931 --> 02:37:22.699
THE SUPPORT BUT ALSO THE

02:37:22.766 --> 02:37:23.934
OPPOSITION?

02:37:24.001 --> 02:37:26.670
THAT BEING SAID ORANGE COUNTY.

02:37:26.737 --> 02:37:30.474
HAS ALSO CHAU NGUYEN -- VERY

02:37:30.541 --> 02:37:33.644
SLOW -- LOOK AT IMPLEMENTING

02:37:33.710 --> 02:37:35.612
THIS WITH REALLY ONLY TWO CITIES

02:37:35.679 --> 02:37:38.048
COSTA MESA AND SANTA ANA I KNOW

02:37:38.115 --> 02:37:39.349
THAT DIDN'T FULLER TEN WHICH IS

02:37:39.416 --> 02:37:41.952
THE LARGEST PART OF MY DISTRICT --

02:37:42.019 --> 02:37:44.788
THAT -- WE THERE'S BEEN NO STEPS --

02:37:44.855 --> 02:37:47.191
TAKING AT THIS POINT AND YET THE

02:37:47.257 --> 02:37:49.092
BLACK MARKET IS WORKING.

02:37:49.159 --> 02:37:51.461
VERY ACTIVELY WORKING IN BECAUSE

02:37:51.528 --> 02:37:53.964
WE DON'T HAVE -- ON THAT PUBLIC

02:37:54.031 --> 02:37:57.034
SAFETY SIDE THE ENFORCEMENT.

02:37:57.100 --> 02:37:58.702
IT JUST SEEMS THAT EVERY TIME

02:37:58.769 --> 02:37:59.603
YOU ARE.

02:37:59.670 --> 02:38:01.839
MOVING INTO A NEW LOCATION IT'S

02:38:01.905 --> 02:38:03.340
VERY CLEAR THAT THEY'RE POPPING

02:38:03.407 --> 02:38:05.008
UP AND IT CAN TAKE SEVERAL

02:38:05.075 --> 02:38:07.744
MONTHS FOR THEM TO CLOSE.

02:38:07.811 --> 02:38:15.018
DOWN -- OPERATION -- THAT.

02:38:15.085 --> 02:38:15.819
AND AGAIN BY THE TIME THEY CLOSE

02:38:15.886 --> 02:38:17.721
ONE DOWN YOU SEE ANOTHER -- FOUR

02:38:17.788 --> 02:38:20.290
FIVE POP UP SO THAT IT -- THE

02:38:20.357 --> 02:38:22.459
CONCERN IS THERE IS THERE USING

02:38:22.526 --> 02:38:26.296
THE SYSTEM AND AS A STATE WITH

02:38:26.363 --> 02:38:29.099
THIS LEGALIZATION ONE OF THE THE

02:38:29.166 --> 02:38:32.002
OPPORTUNITIES WAS THAT WHEN WE

02:38:32.069 --> 02:38:33.403
BROUGHT IT INTO THE FOR FRONT

02:38:33.470 --> 02:38:34.972
DOOR OUT OF THE BLACK MARKET WE

02:38:35.038 --> 02:38:36.340
WOULD START TO SEE.

02:38:36.406 --> 02:38:39.877
SOME TYPE OF REVENUE THAT WOULD.

02:38:39.943 --> 02:38:41.612
NORMALLY BE USED FOR EDUCATION

02:38:41.678 --> 02:38:43.580
BUT MANY OTHER THINGS AND SO

02:38:43.647 --> 02:38:45.515
WITH THAT I'M HOPING THAT AS YOU

02:38:45.582 --> 02:38:46.750
MOVE FORWARD THAT YOU'LL LOOK AT

02:38:46.817 --> 02:38:48.785
THAT THRESH FOR THE REST A SKEWS

02:38:48.852 --> 02:38:51.722
ME THRESHOLD SO THAT -- WE CAN

02:38:51.788 --> 02:38:53.957
IN FACT GO BACK TO OUR DISTRICTS

02:38:54.024 --> 02:38:57.060
AND GIVE THEM THE CONFIDENCE

02:38:57.127 --> 02:38:59.129
THAT WERE UNDERSTANDING BOTH

02:38:59.196 --> 02:39:00.297
SIDES.

02:39:00.364 --> 02:39:02.065
THAT'S RIGHT AND I THINK -- AT

02:39:02.132 --> 02:39:05.269
THE RISK OF OVER GENERALIZING

02:39:05.335 --> 02:39:07.170
OUT WHILE YOU HAVE TO CITIES IN

02:39:07.237 --> 02:39:07.971
YOUR COUNTY THERE ARE ARE

THAT HADN'T.

02:47:23.900 --> 02:47:26.403
THOSE CATS THAT HAD BEEN DE

02:47:26.469 --> 02:47:28.438
CLAWED WERE MUCH LIKELY TO HAVE

02:47:28.505 --> 02:47:29.739
BAD BEHAVIORS.

02:47:29.806 --> 02:47:31.508
SUCH AS URINATION OUTSIDE THE

ARE TWO KITTENS THERE WERE TWO

02:47:50.894 --> 02:47:52.762
CATS THAT WERE DE CLAWED.

02:47:52.829 --> 02:47:56.399
THE FIRST WAS A MALE THAT HAD

02:47:56.466 --> 02:47:57.834
BEEN DE CLAWED WENT TO A PUBLIC.

02:47:57.901 --> 02:47:58.935

URINATING OUTSIDE THE LITTER BOX.

02:48:01.771 --> 02:48:03.873
HAD HE NOT BEEN ADOPTED HE WOULD

02:48:03.940 --> 02:48:05.575
HAVE DIED IN A FEW DAYS.

02:48:05.642 --> 02:48:06.743
DENNY WAS PULLED FROM THE

02:48:06.810 --> 02:48:09.312
SHELTER.

02:48:09.379 --> 02:48:11.080
BY DR GENS FAULT.

02:48:11.147 --> 02:48:13.249
AND DOCTOR JANICE FAULT TOOK HIM

02:48:13.316 --> 02:48:15.118
INTO HIS HOME AND FOUND THAT IF

02:48:15.185 --> 02:48:16.486
YOU USE.

02:48:16.553 --> 02:48:19.255
A CARDBOARD BOX THAT THE ANIMAL

02:48:19.322 --> 02:48:20.857
WOULD URINATE IN THAT AND WAS

02:48:20.924 --> 02:48:22.992
ABLE TO KEEP THE ANIMAL FOR MANY

02:48:23.059 --> 02:48:24.327
YEARS.

02:48:24.394 --> 02:48:25.929
THROUGH ITS NORMAL LIFE.

02:48:25.995 --> 02:48:29.232
THE SECOND WAS A FEMALE WHO HAD

02:48:29.299 --> 02:48:31.100
BEEN DE CLAWED AS A KITTEN.

02:48:31.167 --> 02:48:32.569
THE CAB AS IT GREW OLDER BECAME

02:48:32.635 --> 02:48:34.204
ON PREDICTABLY AGGRESSIVE IN

02:48:34.270 --> 02:48:35.572
WOULD BITE AT THE SLIGHTEST

02:48:35.638 --> 02:48:36.706
PROVOCATION.

02:48:36.773 --> 02:48:38.842
WITH THE INTERNET COULD NOT DEAL

02:48:38.908 --> 02:48:40.810
WITH CATS MATERIAL CAMPER --

02:48:40.877 --> 02:48:42.479
DOCTOR JANICE FALL TOOK THE CAT

02:48:42.545 --> 02:48:45.014
INTO ITS OWN HOME.

02:48:45.081 --> 02:48:46.382
AND RAISED IT.

02:48:46.449 --> 02:48:47.417
BOTH OF THESE CATS HAD BEHAVIORS

02:48:47.484 --> 02:48:48.918
THAT ARE KNOWN TO BE FOUND MORE

02:48:48.985 --> 02:48:52.689
OFTEN AND DECRIED CLASS HE'S ME.

02:48:52.755 --> 02:48:53.990
DECLAWED CATS.

02:48:54.057 --> 02:48:55.692
AND BOTH CATS CAME CLOSE TO

02:48:55.758 --> 02:48:57.594
BEING KILLED DUTY AND TOLERANCE

02:48:57.660 --> 02:48:59.362
OF THESE BEHAVIORS.

02:48:59.429 --> 02:49:01.865
IT IS MY PRIVILEGE TO BE UP HERE

02:49:01.931 --> 02:49:02.966
CALLING FOR AN END TO THIS

02:49:03.032 --> 02:49:05.935
PRACTICE WHICH IS MORE LIKELY TO

02:49:06.002 --> 02:49:11.808
HURT AN ANIMAL THEN SAVE IT.

02:49:11.875 --> 02:49:13.009
GIVEN ALL THAT IT'S NOT

02:49:13.076 --> 02:49:14.644
SURPRISING THAT THE CALIFORNIA

02:49:14.711 --> 02:49:16.446

02:49:16.513 --> 02:49:18.381
DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF CATS

RELINQUISH TO SHELTERS SINCE

02:49:20.216 --> 02:49:21.985
THEIR BANDS WHEN INTO A FACT

02:49:22.051 --> 02:49:23.419
THAT TO DECREASE.

02:49:23.486 --> 02:49:25.021
IN THOSE THAT ARE REFERRED TO

02:49:25.088 --> 02:49:26.723
SHELTERS.

02:49:26.789 --> 02:49:28.458
WELL SOME VETERINARIANS BELIEVE

02:49:28.525 --> 02:49:29.659
THAT YOU MEAN HEALTH ISSUES NEW

02:49:29.726 --> 02:49:32.428
TEST YET NECESSITATE DECLINE

02:49:32.495 --> 02:49:36.132
THIS IS INCORRECT -- WE HAVE IN

02:49:36.199 --> 02:49:38.001
FACT TESTIMONY FROM THE HEM

02:49:38.067 --> 02:49:40.637
APHELIA COUNCIL OF CALIFORNIA.

02:49:40.703 --> 02:49:42.138
BOTTOM LINE HAVE A FEEL HE IS

02:49:42.205 --> 02:49:44.374
NOT A REASONS TO CLAW YOUR CAT.

02:49:44.440 --> 02:49:47.277
WE HAVE A LETTER FROM A HAM

02:49:47.343 --> 02:49:50.380

HAMMER MYCOLOGICAL ONCOLOGIST

02:49:53.149 --> 02:49:54.417
SAYING THAT [inaudible]

02:49:54.484 --> 02:49:56.419
HE HAS.

02:49:56.486 --> 02:49:58.221
PATIENTS WHO ARE ON BLOOD

02:49:58.288 --> 02:49:59.622
THINNERS HE HAS PATIENTS WHO

02:49:59.689 --> 02:50:02.058
HAVE.

02:50:02.125 --> 02:50:04.327
POOR IMMUNE SYSTEMS AND YET HE

02:50:04.394 --> 02:50:06.062
WOULD NEVER.

02:50:06.129 --> 02:50:08.598
ASK THE CATS BE CLAWED BECAUSE

02:50:08.665 --> 02:50:10.767
IT'S SIMPLY NOT AN ISSUE.

02:50:10.833 --> 02:50:11.267
WHEN I'VE TALKED TO THE

02:50:11.334 --> 02:50:14.270
VETERINARIANS THEIR MAIN REASON?

02:50:14.337 --> 02:50:16.506
FOR ALLOWING THIS IS THE FACT

02:50:16.573 --> 02:50:18.575
THAT IT HELPS HUMAN HEALTH FOR

02:50:18.641 --> 02:50:19.609
PEOPLE WHO ARE IN FACT HAVE A

02:50:19.676 --> 02:50:22.045
PHILLY ACTS OR ON BLOOD THINNERS.

02:50:22.111 --> 02:50:23.379
AND IN FACT.

02:50:23.446 --> 02:50:25.381
THAT IS NOT THE CASE ACCORDING

02:50:25.448 --> 02:50:27.951
TO THE HUMAN DOCTORS.

02:50:28.017 --> 02:50:29.285
FURTHERMORE.

IF THE CAT CANNOT SCRATCH IT'S

02:50:30.820 --> 02:50:32.522
MORE LIKELY TO BUY THIS LEADS TO

02:50:32.589 --> 02:50:36.426
INFECTION -- WHICH CAN'T FAT CAT

02:50:36.492 --> 02:50:38.461
SCRATCHES REALLY DO.

02:50:38.528 --> 02:50:40.129
THUS THE CENTER FOR DISEASE

02:50:40.196 --> 02:50:41.531
CONTROL DOES NOT RECOMMEND

02:50:41.598 --> 02:50:42.999
PEOPLE WITH COMPROMISED IMMUNE

THE WHOLE ENTIRE STATE AND THIS

03:39:17.344 --> 03:39:18.678
DOESN'T ADDRESS THE ISSUES THAT

THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND SO

03:39:25.719 --> 03:39:28.455
WE CAN'T PICK AND CHOOSE WHICH

FOR THEM FOR ME I WANT TO

03:39:33.727 --> 03:39:35.662
ADDRESS THE ISSUE ESPECIALLY

03:39:35.729 --> 03:39:37.631
WITH THE SILVER TSUNAMI THAT'S

03:39:37.697 --> 03:39:39.866

THEY NEED CARE OUR LONG TERM

03:39:44.104 --> 03:39:45.472
CARE FACILITIES HAVE A SHORTAGE

03:39:45.539 --> 03:39:47.574
AND SO IF WE ARE GOING TO TALK

03:39:47.641 --> 03:39:49.843
ABOUT STATISTICS -- AND THERE'S

03:39:49.910 --> 03:39:52.646
AN ODD SHORTAGE IN PARTS OF

03:39:52.712 --> 03:39:54.214
CALIFORNIA THAT NEEDS TO BE

03:39:54.281 --> 03:39:55.782

AMOUNT OF ANY OTHER PROFESSIONS.

03:40:03.690 --> 03:40:05.292
AND I DON'T SEE WHY WE WOULD CAP

03:40:05.358 --> 03:40:09.162
A THIS CRITICAL -- COMPONENT OF

03:40:09.229 --> 03:40:10.864
OUR HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE SO

03:40:10.931 --> 03:40:13.867
THAT'S MY OPINION BUT IN TERMS

03:40:13.934 --> 03:40:16.303
OF THE THAT TECHNICAL ISSUES

03:40:16.369 --> 03:40:17.704
GEORGE DO YOU WANT.

03:40:17.771 --> 03:40:18.805
TO TALK ABOUT THAT.

03:40:18.872 --> 03:40:20.106
YEAH ONE ONE I'D DON'T THINK WE

03:40:20.173 --> 03:40:21.808
DISAGREE WITH COMMUNITY COLLEGES

03:40:21.875 --> 03:40:23.677
THAT SIMULATION IS ONE PORTION

03:40:23.743 --> 03:40:25.612
AND AND THE THE EXAM IS ONE

03:40:25.679 --> 03:40:26.980
PORTION AND AND YOU GOT A LOOK

03:40:27.047 --> 03:40:28.682
AT THE BODY AS A WHOLE I ALSO

03:40:28.748 --> 03:40:35.322
DON'T THINK THAT YOU GET IN THE

03:40:35.388 --> 03:40:36.056
WE ALSO AGREE THAT.

03:40:36.122 --> 03:40:36.690
IF A COMMUNITY COLLEGE SEATS ARE

03:40:36.756 --> 03:40:37.591
AVAILABLE THAT IS THE LOWEST

03:40:37.657 --> 03:40:39.593
COST OPTION AND WE'RE NOT THAT

03:40:39.659 --> 03:40:40.393
THAT IS IN FACT THE CASE IN A

03:40:40.460 --> 03:40:41.761
COMMUNITY COLLEGE SEATS ARE

03:40:41.828 --> 03:40:43.763
AVAILABLE THAT'S A GREAT OPTION

03:40:43.830 --> 03:40:45.532
ESPECIALLY IF YOU WANT TO GET IN

03:40:45.599 --> 03:40:47.067
INTO YOUR EIGHTY AND IF YOU WANT

03:40:47.133 --> 03:40:47.734
TO GO BEYOND.

03:40:47.801 --> 03:40:48.668
THAT OR WHAT HAVE YOU THERE ARE

03:40:48.735 --> 03:40:51.338
OTHER OPTIONS IN IN IT IS AN

03:40:51.404 --> 03:40:53.106
ISSUE AND THE AND THE THE THE

03:40:53.173 --> 03:40:54.574
CLINICAL SLOTS ARE AN ISSUE.

03:40:54.641 --> 03:40:55.809
WE'RE NOT TRYING TO OPEN UP THE

03:40:55.875 --> 03:40:57.110
FLOODGATES HERE.

03:40:57.177 --> 03:40:58.778
WE ARE TRYING TO WEAVE I THINK

03:40:58.845 --> 03:41:00.213
THE COMMITTEE IS PUT IN SOME

03:41:00.280 --> 03:41:01.514
GOOD AMENDMENTS.

03:41:01.581 --> 03:41:02.649
WITH THAT COMMITTEE OFFERED

03:41:02.716 --> 03:41:03.750
AMENDMENTS ABOUT MAKING

03:41:03.817 --> 03:41:06.019
CONTRIBUTIONS TO HOSPITALS AS IT

03:41:06.086 --> 03:41:07.487
WAS ALLEGED.

03:41:07.554 --> 03:41:09.122
OR MENTIONED I SHOULD SAY A

03:41:09.189 --> 03:41:10.824
MOMENT AGO.

03:41:10.890 --> 03:41:12.425
TO PUT A PROHIBITION IN PLACE.

03:41:12.492 --> 03:41:15.895
THE COMMITTEE PUT IN A COHORT

03:41:15.962 --> 03:41:17.430
DEFAULT RATE WHICHIS ACTUALLY

03:41:17.497 --> 03:41:19.399
LESS THAN HALF OF WHAT IT WOULD

03:41:19.466 --> 03:41:23.136
TAKE TO BE ABLE TO BE ELIGIBLE.

03:41:23.203 --> 03:41:24.471
FOR ACCOUNT NANCY ACTUALLY HAVE

03:41:24.537 --> 03:41:27.073
TO PERFORM IT TWICE THE LEVEL OF

03:41:27.140 --> 03:41:28.742
AN INSTITUTION QUALIFYING FOR

03:41:28.808 --> 03:41:30.477
CAL GRANTS SO I THINK THE

03:41:30.543 --> 03:41:32.512
COMMITTEE IS DONE A LOT. TO IT

03:41:32.579 --> 03:41:33.279

03:41:34.547 --> 03:41:36.316
BETTER BILL TO BE HONEST WITH

03:41:36.383 --> 03:41:37.484

03:41:37.550 --> 03:41:41.054
INTRODUCED IT.

03:41:41.121 --> 03:41:42.455
AND I THINK THAT.

03:41:42.522 --> 03:41:43.690
THE THE SPONSORS WANT TO WORK

03:41:43.757 --> 03:41:45.358
WITH THE OPPOSITION I HAD A I

03:41:45.425 --> 03:41:47.160
HAD A REALLY GOOD MEETING WITH

CONTINUE TO WORK MOVING FORWARD.

03:41:53.366 --> 03:41:54.534
AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT EVERYONE

03:41:54.601 --> 03:41:58.438
HERE WANTS WE DO NOT HAVE THIS.

03:41:58.505 --> 03:42:00.273

BECAUSE THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES

03:42:05.645 --> 03:42:06.913

THE BIG CAP THAT YOU REFERRED TO

03:42:51.224 --> 03:42:52.158
IS IT WAS REALLY NOT THE NUMBER

03:42:52.225 --> 03:42:53.626
OF NURSES THAT CAN BE EDUCATED

03:42:53.693 --> 03:42:54.627
BUT SEE A NUMBER OF CLINICAL

03:42:54.694 --> 03:42:56.229
PLACEMENTS THAT EXIST IN THE

03:42:56.296 --> 03:42:57.297

EDUCATION THAT'S NECESSARY FOR

03:42:59.532 --> 03:43:01.568
THE HOURS AND OF A CLINICAL

OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE ARE

03:43:05.071 --> 03:43:06.806
NEEDED IN ORDER TO MEET THE

03:43:06.873 --> 03:43:07.340
OBJECTIVES OF THE NURSING

03:43:07.407 --> 03:43:08.374
PROGRAM.

03:43:08.441 --> 03:43:10.810
SO WHEN GROWTH IS CENTERED IN

03:43:10.877 --> 03:43:13.213
THE CENTRAL AREA SPECIFIC AREA

03:43:13.279 --> 03:43:14.214
HOSPITALS AND HEALTH CARE

03:43:14.280 --> 03:43:15.982
AGENCIES ARE OVER RUN WITH

03:43:16.049 --> 03:43:17.684
REQUEST TO SUPPORT NURSING

03:43:17.751 --> 03:43:20.420

SEVEN DAYS A WEEK.

03:43:21.588 --> 03:43:23.423
SO THE CAP EXIST IN THE CLINICAL

03:43:23.490 --> 03:43:26.392
PLACEMENTS WHEN A NEW PROGRAM

03:43:26.459 --> 03:43:28.161
COMES IN AND CLINICAL PLACEMENTS

03:43:28.228 --> 03:43:30.296
ARE FULL OR CAPPED AND HAVE NO

03:43:30.363 --> 03:43:32.532
MORE ROOM SOMEONE ASKED TO LEAVE.

03:43:32.599 --> 03:43:34.134
THEY HAVE TO MAKE ROOM AND

03:43:34.200 --> 03:43:36.102
HISTORICALLY IT'S BEEN THE

03:43:36.169 --> 03:43:37.804
COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS WHO

03:43:37.871 --> 03:43:40.306
ARE DISPLACED BY THE GROWING

03:43:40.373 --> 03:43:42.208
PROGRAMS THAT HAVE GROWN WITHOUT

03:43:42.275 --> 03:43:46.913
REGULATION AND VERY RAPIDLY.

03:43:46.980 --> 03:43:48.515
IF I MAY I DON'T BELIEVE THAT

03:43:48.581 --> 03:43:51.117
THE THE SCHOOLS THE SPONSORS --

03:43:51.184 --> 03:43:53.286
ARE ADDING A MORE SCHOOLS THESE

03:43:53.353 --> 03:43:55.455
PRIVATE SCHOOLS IN THE CENTRAL

GOING TO ADDRESS.

03:44:02.729 --> 03:44:04.531
I DO KNOW THE WESTERN GOVERNORS

03:44:04.597 --> 03:44:06.800
UNIVERSITY IS ACTIVELY LOOKING

03:44:06.866 --> 03:44:08.334
AT PARTNERSHIPS IN THE VALLEY I

03:44:08.401 --> 03:44:09.669
KNOW THAT THEY ARE.

03:44:09.736 --> 03:44:11.037
IN DISCUSSIONS WITH THE

03:44:11.104 --> 03:44:13.206
CORRECTIONAL HOSPITAL AND I

03:44:13.273 --> 03:44:14.908
BELIEVE IT IS STOCKTON ABOUT

03:44:14.974 --> 03:44:18.211
PARTNERING WITH THEM ON BEING

03:44:18.278 --> 03:44:19.979
ABLE TO DO CLINICAL ROTATIONS.

03:44:20.046 --> 03:44:25.785
SAID THEY ARE VERY MUCH --

03:44:25.852 --> 03:44:26.386
THINK THEY'RE ALSO LOOKING TO

03:44:26.452 --> 03:44:27.487
WORK IN.

03:44:27.554 --> 03:44:29.022
THE PARTNERSHIP IN NORTHERN

03:44:29.088 --> 03:44:31.825
CALIFORNIA AS WELL IN AREAS THAT.

03:44:31.891 --> 03:44:35.094
THERE ARE -- MORE ACUTE

03:44:35.161 --> 03:44:37.864
SHORTAGES YOU THINK I CAN ANSWER
