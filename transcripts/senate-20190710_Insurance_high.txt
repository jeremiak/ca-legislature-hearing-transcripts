HE IS AMONG MANY ITEMS HIS REALLY -- IS ZEROING IN ON LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE AS WE'VE HEARD IN THIS COMMITTEE HAS HAS DECENTLY DALTON LTC MATTERS THROUGHOUT THE YEARS ANDY. CONTINUE JUST CONCERNED WITH INCREASING HIGH COST OF LTC INSURANCE RATES ON CONSUMERS IS YOU KNOW OR MIGHT KNOW THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE. DOES CONDUCT A RIGOROUS REVIEW OF ALL RATE INCREASE REQUESTS THAT COE BEFORE THE DEPARTMENT THEY LOOK AND MAKE SURE AND ONLY APPROVE A RATE INCREASE IF THE INSURER FALLS ALL CURRENT LAWS. IN ORDER TO MINIMIZE THE IMPACT WERE POSSIBLE THE DEPARTMENT IS ALSO IN HAS BEEN REVIEWING AND APPROVING NEW OUR PRODUCTS. FOR PLACEMENT ON THE MARKET THAT OFFER A DIFFERENT WAY TO PLAN FOR FUTURE ALTI SEEDS NEEDS THAT MAY PRESENT A MORE AFFORDABLE PACKAGE. FOR CONSUMERS AND SO WHAT WE'VE SEEN AND THIS. WE WE IT WITHIN THE MARKET PLACES GOING FROM STANDALONE LTC POLICIES TO MORE HYBRID -- INCH WHERE YOU HAVE EL TO SEE POLICIES AND LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES ARE PUT TOGETHER ALONG WITH VERY VERY ABEL'S WITHOUT END OF THEMSELVES AND SO. IT'S JUST LOOKING AT WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN HAVE. AND PRESENT A A A MORE AFFORDABLE PACKAGE OFINSURANCE FOR SOME CONSUMERS IF THEY SO NEEDED AND AS WELL AS THE COMMISSION IS LOOKING AT WAYS. TO IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY AN INTERNAL REVIEW TURNAROUND OF LTC AYE PRODUCTS AT THE DEPARTMENT WHILE ENSURING CALIFORNIA SPECIFIC. CONSUMER PROTECTIONS APPLY TO THESE PRODUCTS I'M CONVENE ALL OF THIS TO IN ORDER. TO A PAINT THIS PICTURE FROM THE DEPARTMENT'S PERSPECTIVE THAT THERE IS A A A A A A BIG PICTURE WITH REGARD TO LTC PRODUCTS AND AND ENSURING THAT. A WIDE DIVERSITY OF PRODUCTS ARE AVAILABLE IN THE MARKET PLACE THAT THERE ARE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS PROVIDED. AND THAT -- AND THAT THIS BILL IS A HUGE COMPONENT AND BEING ABLE TO HELP -- ADDRESS AND ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIANS ARE CLEARLY AWARE OF THE NEED TO PLAN. FOR THEIR LONG TERM CARE NEEDS. AS WHAT THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER HAD STATED. THAT THIS PRODUCT I'M SORRY THIS MEASURE WOULD GIVE CONSUMERS. A RIGHT TO ACCESS BENEFITS THEY'RE PAID.

GOOD AFTERNOON SHERRY MCCUE REPRESENT THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES WE LIKE TO THINK THE SPONSORING THE AUTHOR. FOR WORKING WITH US TO ADDRESS OUR CONCERNS WE STILL HAVE A FEW REMAINING ISSUES THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS BUT WE'RE VERY CALM FOR THE BILL MOVING FORWARD TODAY SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE THOSE CONVERSATIONS. AND ADDRESS THE ISSUES ARE BEFORE THE BILL'S TAKEN UP ON THE SENATE FLOOR THANK YOU. ANYBODY ELSE WISHING TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. IN NONE ANYBODY WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION. WITHOUT MEMBERS WISHING TO SPEAK. MISTRUST LEVELS A BILL ANYBODY ELSE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS CONCERNS COMMENTS. SO I DO HAVE ONE QUESTION IF YOU DON'T MIND -- I JUST OUT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE -- IF YOU COULD EXPLAIN HOW DID YOU COME UP WITH THE A ONE TEN AGE GROUP. GOING TO THE BELL -- IT OFFERS UP. TO CONTENTS I'M JUST CURIOUS ABOUT THAT ONE TEN A LET THE TECHNICAL QUESTIONS BE ANSWERED BY [inaudible] OR THE FAMILY YEAH. I AM A SMITH THANK YOU WELCOME. YES GOOD AFTERNOON EMILY SMITH AN ATTORNEY WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE. THE IDEA OF SETTING THE AGE AT ONE TEN IS NOT A MAGIC NUMBER BUT IT WAS DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT THE POLICY IS IS SAFE UNTIL. AS AS LONG AS THE CONSUMERS EXPECTED TO NEED IT. OKAY WELL THANK YOU I REALLY I WAS JUST. CURIOUS ABOUT THAT BUT I DO HAVE JUST ANOTHER -- STATEMENT THAT I WANT TO MAKE I KNOW THAT THAT WERE REQUIRED THE INSURERS TO OFFER NEW FEATURES ON EXISTING PRODUCTS BUT WE DO HAVE UP INFORMATION -- ABOUT NEW PRODUCTS BEING APPROVED IN TAKING UP TO THREE YEARS IN THE INSURANCE. CAN YOU SPEAK TO THAT ABOUT EXPEDITING THE APPROVAL PROCESS FOR NEW PRODUCTS. ABSOLUTELY A TRIVIA IS THAT TO DO IT I APPRECIATE THAT AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT -- JUST KINDLY MAYOR IN MY YEAH IN MY EARLIER REMARKS -- ANTICIPATING THAT IS SOMETHING OF OF KEEN INTEREST TO THE INDUSTRY WITH REGARD TO PRODUCT APPROVAL THAT. IN THE SIX MONTHS THAT -- THE COMMISSION NOW BEING THERE IS THAT HE ACTUALLY IS LOOKING AT THE INTERNAL REVIEW AND PRODUCT APPROVAL OF PRODUCTS INCLUDING LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT HE ACTUALLY IS. ROLLING UP HIS SLEEVES BECAUSE AS YOU CAN IMAGINE IT IS A IT'S AN INTERNAL ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS -- FOR REVIEWING AND AND READING AND IT'S A LOT OF BACK AND FORTH -- COLLABORATION IN AN INTERNAL DISCUSSION AS WELL AS COMMUNICATION WITH THE INSURER WHO WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THESE PRODUCTS SO AGAINST VICE TO SAY HE'S ROLLING UP HIS SLEEVES HE PERSONALLY IS. AND I'M WITH THEIR WITH THEM IN THE ROOM TO TO ME AND MEETING WITH STAFF. IS TO OKAY IF I AND AND AND YOU KNOW ACNE INSURANCE COMPANY I'VE A PRODUCT. ONE FROM POINT A TO THE NEXT STEPS HE'S LEARNING THAT IN ORDER TO SEE WHAT ARE SOME ADDITIONAL EFFICIENCIES. AN INTERNAL REVIEW TURN AROUND -- BUT A A OF FAST TRACKING THAT COULD BE POTENTIAL POTENTIALLY POSSIBLE -- AS HE AGAIN AND AND IN THE ENSUING WEEKS AND MONTHS AND HIS TENURE THERE SO IT AGAIN SOMETHING IT'S A PARTY THAT HE IS LOOKING AT THANK YOU I'M CERTAINLY CONFIDENT THAT AND HE'LL GET THERE -- I BELIEVE YOU HAD A QUESTION MUCH MORE LIKE. WE GET ASKED MORE QUESTIONS OF THIS HONOR. I'M I'M JUST CURIOUS ABOUT LAPSING -- YOUR BILL HAS NO LAPSE GUARANTEES AND INDUSTRIES CONCERNED ABOUT THAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO COMMENT. SURE SURE I AB. BASICALLY THIS THIS BILL HAD FOUR DIFFERENT COMPONENTS. THAT'S TRYING TO ADDRESS WHETHER IT'S THE NO RATE INCREASES IN LATER YEARS -- DISCLOSURE AND THE INFORMATION -- TAKING OUT OF LOANS AS WELL AS THE LAPSING OF POLICY BECAUSE WHAT'S HAPPENING IS WE'RE SEEING. THE WORK FORCE POPULATION WHO IS HAS AN AGE YET PURCHASING THESE LONG TERM CARE OR OR OR WHOLE LIFE INSURANCE WITH THE WRITERS -- LONG TERM CARE WRITERS AT SOME% POINT LATER ON SEEING THAT WHILE THEY'RE NOT EMPLOYED ANYMORE THEY'RE NOT WORKING ANYMORE. BUT THE PREMIUMS THAT THEY'RE MAKING. IS BECOMING. BIGGER AND BIGGER. A WHOLE AYE PRODUCT. UP FOR IS WITH THE ONES HAVING TO DO WITH THE LONG TERM THEY'RE BUYING HYBRIDS OR WRITER BE CRATER RIGHT. AND SO AND AND SO IN ORDER TO AND AND SOMETIMES THAT CONTRIBUTES TO LAPSING OF PAYING THE MEMES WHICH THEN LEADS THE CANCELLATION OF THE PRODUCT. AND SO THERE WERE GUARANTEED THIS IS AN ATTEMPT TO PROTECT. THESE CONSUMERS FROM THEIR PROGRAM -- FROM THEIR A INSURANCE EVER LAPSING OR BEING CANCELED ON THEM -- AND MOST RECENTLY WE'VE HAD SOME DISCUSSIONS. ABOUT. WHETHER THERE IS THE LAPSE OR WHETHER THERE IS A NO RATE INCREASE ONE LEADS TO THE OTHER. SO WE'RE STILL AN ONGOING CONVERSATIONS OVER THAT THERE WAS THE NEXT QUESTION UNIVERSALMUSIC RATE NEUTRALITY IS A NEW TERM WITH THE THE WILD FIRES IN THE UTILITIES BUT ABOUT PREMIUM NEUTRALITY [inaudible] WELL. I'LL LEAVE THAT TO THE INDUSTRY. TO THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER AND THE INDUSTRY TO TO COIN WHAT FREE AS THEY WANT UNLESS IF YOU'RE ASKING THE QUESTION I'M SORRY NO NO I'M JUST WONDERING IF IF THE BILL WILL IMPACT PREMIUM. PRICES IN IT WILL PRICE OUT YOUNGER PULL THAT THAT'S ONE OF THE CONCERNS OBVIOUSLY. AND SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE SEEING IF MAYBE IT'S YOUR AND FURTHER DISCUSSIONS TO YES. I GUESS BECAUSE MAYBE. MAYBE AS WRITTEN ITSELF CREATING TOO MANY. OF OBSTACLES FOR MOVEMENT AS WELL -- SO WE'RE NOT GOING CONVERSATION. AND WOMEN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU ANYBODY ELSE WISHING TO ASK ANY QUESTIONS. THE NINE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ANSWERING OUR QUESTIONS I DO HAVE A MOTION BY MISTER LET OUT ITS TO PASS TO SENATE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. I RUBIO I JONES. ARCHULETA AYE ARCHULETA I BATES. DODD. DODD AYE GALGIANI GALGIANI AYE GLAZER WE SO. WE SO I MITCHELL MORE LOCK. MOORLACH AYE PORTANTINO ROTH. WE'RE GONNA LEAVE THE BILL ON CALL FOR THE ABSENT MEMBERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH VERY MUCH. WE NEED. I SEE A SEVEN MEMBER BURKE -- WORK NEXT IS AB SEVEN FORTY BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER. AUTUMN BURKE PROPERTY INSURANCE WELCOME. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND SENATORS. YEAH I LATE SENATE INSURANCE SO MUCH I CAME BACK FOR MORE. I AB SEVEN FORTY HAS BEEN AMENDED TO EXPAND THE ELIGIBILITY ELIGIBLE AREAS FOR RIGHT OUT CREDITS WITHIN THE FAIR PLAN FOR A MINUTE HOMEOWNERS INSURERS. THE FAIR PLAN IS A PRIVATE ASSOCIATION COMPRISED OF ALL PROPERTY INSURANCE IN CALIFORNIA. CURRENTLY IF AN INSURER WRITES AN INDEPENDENT HOMEOWNER POLICY ANY BRUSH HAZARD AREA IS DEFINED AS I ASSUME. THE RECEIVER RIGHT OUT CREDIT WHICH MEANS THAT IN A YEAR THAT FAIR PLAN EXPERIENCES A LOSS ENSURE WITH A RIGHT OUT CREDIT WOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY THEIR FOR MARKET SHARE BACK TO THE PLAN. IT WOULD BE THEIR MARKET SHARE MINUS THE RIGHT OUT CREDITS FOR ON THE POLICIES WRITTEN IN THE BRUSH HAZARD ZONE. INTO THE COMEDIAN OUNCES THE LINES OF BUSINESS THAT ARE INCLUDED IN THE CALCULATION FOR PARTICIPATION IMPAIR PLAN INCLUDED OR FIRE AT ALLY ALLY THE LINES HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE COMMERCIAL MONTH MULTIPLE PERIL AN EARTHQUAKE. ALL WRITTEN PREMIUM DATA RECEIVED A 100% CREDIT EXCEPT FOR HOMEOWNERS PREMIUMS LITERACY ONLY THE PROPERTY PORTION OF THE PREMIUMS. THIS BILL WOULD ADD -- HI AM VERY HIGH HAZARD SEVERITY ZONES AS DETERMINE AND THAT BY CAL FIRE TO THE EXISTING AYSO BRUSH HAZARD AREA. THAT QUALIFIES INSURERS FOR CREDITS THE CURRENT ISO BRUSH HAZARD AREA ARE VERY LIMITED AND FOCUS ON MORE URBAN AREAS OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. AS A RESULT SOME REGIONAL COMPANIES HAVE NO OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN THE RIGHT OUT CREDITS. RIGHT IN ELIGIBLE AREAS TO INCLUDE THOSE OF GREATER RISK FOR WELFARE CAN INCREASE ACCESSIBILITY FOR HOMEOWNERS TO IN CHANGE AND TO OBTAIN INSURANCE POLICIES. THE GOAL OF AB SEVEN FORTY IS TO INCENTIVIZE INSURERS TO WRITE POLICIES IN. MORE HIGH RISK FIRE ZONES IN AN EFFORT TO INCREASE THE OPTIONS FOR HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE IN THESE AREAS. I AM COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE AND THEIR PLAN TO INJURIES ADDRESS ISSUES OF AVAILABILITY OF HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE IN CALIFORNIA ESPECIALLY IN AREAS OF HIGH FIRE AT RISK. CALIFORNIANS ARE EXPERIENCING ISSUES WITH THE INSURANCE AVAILABILITY NOMINALS AND UNDER INSURANCE AB SEVEN FORTY IS ONE PATHWAY. TO ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES SPECIFICALLY AROUND THE ISSUES OF INSURANCE AVAILABILITY THIS BILL CAN HELP BETTER I'M PREPARING PROTECT OUR CONSTITUENTS AGAINST FURTHER DISASTER I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST ENABLE. THANK YOU ANYBODY ELSE WISHING TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. AFTER MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE ARMAND FELICIANO ABOUT THE FAIR PLAN WE ARE IN SUPPORT OF AB. SEVEN FORTY AS THE INSURER OF LAST RESORT. ONE OF THE FEW PLANS MANDATE IS TO ENGAGE MAXIMUM. USE OF THE PRIVATE MARKET IN OBTAINING PROPERTY INSURANCE. AND WE BELIEVE THIS BILL IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. TRIBAL THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYBODY ELSE WISHING TO SPEAK. BUT AFTERNOON ANNA BUCK ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU ANYBODY ELSE WISHING TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT PLEASE COME UP TO THE MIKE. THE NO INTEREST ANYBODY WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION. I SEE NO ENTRANCE MEMBERS ANY QUESTIONS BOB KATHLEEN SERVICE I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD WE COULD HAVE PREDICTED THAT RATES WOULD INCREASE EXPONENTIALLY. AND I WAS ACTUALLY AT A A GROUP OF REALTORS RECENTLY WHERE ACTUAL MEMBERS WERE SPEAKING OF INCREASES THAT WERE FIVE TO SEVEN TIMES OVER WHAT THEY ORIGINALLY WERE PAYING. AND WHEN YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT SOMEONE'S GOING TO BE PAYING THREE TO FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS MORE A MONTH FOR HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE. THAT MEANS FOR MANY THT THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO HOLD ON TO THEIR HOME MAKE INSURANCE PAYMENT. AND THE HOUSE PAYMENT SO I PREDICT THAT UNLESS WE DO SOMETHING TO ADDRESS THIS IN A DRAMATIC WAY THAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE PEOPLE LOSING THEIR HOMES. AND THAT GOES AGAINST OUR GOALS OF MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE HAVE HOUSING AND PREVENTING ANOTHER HOUSING CRISIS IN SOME OF THESE AREAS HAVE. BEEN -- HARD HIT BY THE WILDFIRES AND BECAUSE OF FORECLOSURES. WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD THANK YOU. ANY OTHER MEMBERS WISHING TO ASK QUESTIONS. I SEEM NINE TOWN. THESE.
