DR PAN CENTER PANEL YOU MAY BEGIN THANK YOU CHAIR AT THANK YOU MEMBERS- OFFICIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY AND TO PRESENT SB SEVEN FORTY TWO A BILL THAT BALANCES ARE RIGHT TO ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE. PRIVACY AND FREEDOM OF SPEECH. FIRST I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH MY OFFICE OVER THE PAST FEW WEEKS AND I'M OF COURSE WILL BE ACCEPTING THE PROPOSED COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS SO THANK YOU. FOR OVER A YEAR WE'VE WORKED SIDE BY SIDE TO FOLLOW THE SCIENCE AND DATA TO SAVE AS MANY LIVES AS POSSIBLE DURING THE COAT. NINETEEN OFTEN AT A COST TO OTHER PARTS OF COMMUNITY AND LIFE. IN CALIFORNIA WE KNOW OF OVER THREE POINT SEVEN MILLION CASES A CO BID AND UNFORTUNATELY. OVER SIXTY THOUSAND DEATHS. WE'VE EXPERIENCED THE PAIN OF TRYING TO GRIEVE FOR LOVED ONES FROM THE FARD STRAIN. ON FAMILIES TO WORK OFTEN FROM HOME SUPPORT THEIR CHILDREN'S LEARNING THROUGH A COMPUTER TO STRUGGLE SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS. PUSH TO KEEP THE DOORS OPEN EVEN WHEN CUSTOMERS CAN COME IN AND THE WORSHIP VIRTUALLY KEEP EACH OTHER SAFE IN FACT LAST NIGHT WE TOOK ACTIONS TO TRY TO ADDRESS. THESE ISSUES. ALL OF THE SACRIFICE THAT WE'VE BEEN GIVEN IT'S BEEN ABOUT BUYING TIME TO FIND THE MEDICAL BREAKTHROUGHS WHAT SCIENCE COULD HELP US BRING AN END TO THE DARK MOMENT STAFF CALLED US. GIVE MORE THAN WE EVER THOUGHT WAS POSSIBLE. THANKFULLY BECAUSE OF DECADES OF RESEARCH AND SCIENCE RON IMMUNOLOGY. WE HAVE A CHANCE TO BRING THIS PANDEMIC TO A CLOSE. WE'RE FINALLY. STARTING TO SAFELY REOPEN OUR COMMUNITIES. BUT THAT OPPORTUNITY MAYBE A LOSS IF WE DON'T GET ENOUGH PEOPLE VACCINATED. AND WHILE THE FEDERAL STATE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE DOING BETTER AND BETTER EACH DAY AND DISTRIBUTING COVER NINETEEN VACCINES IN EDUCATING THE PUBLIC. ABOUT THE NEED FOR THE VACCINE. FORTUNATELY ANTI VACCINE EXTREMISTS THAT WE ARE ALL TOO FAMILIAR WITH EVEN VERY HERE IN THIS VERY BUILDING. HAVE BEEN ESCALATING WITH THE DISRUPTIVE TACTICS. TO STOP AND DISRUPT THESE EFFORTS TO PROTECT CALIFORNIANS. AND THAT'S WHY I'M ASKING YOU SUPPORT SB SEVEN FORTY TWO SO WE CAN MAKE SURE PEOPLE HAVE STILL HAVE AMPLE OPPORTUNITY TO PRACTICE FREE SPEECH. AND WE CAN MAKE SURE PUBLIC OFFICIALS HAVE MORE TOOLS TO ENSURE PATIENTS SO OUR CONSTITUENTS AND FRONTLINE WORKERS A VACCINE CLINICS ARE SAFE THEMSELVES SOME INTIMIDATION HARASSMENT AND PHYSICAL OBSTRUCTION. MANY OF YOU HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE SHUTDOWN OF THE VACCINE CLINIC IN JANUARY AT DODGER STADIUM. WHERE A MOB OF ANTI VACCINE EXTREMISTS STOP THE CLINIC FROM OPERATING JEOPARDIZING THE SAFETY OF PATIENTS AND FRONTLINE WORKERS. BUT UNFORTUNATELY THIS IS NOT A SINGLE. EPISODE THESE EXTREMISTS ARE CONDUCTING SIMILAR OPERATIONS ALL OVER THE STATE OFTEN TRYING TO BLEND IN AS FRONT LINE WORKERS INDESTRUCTIBLE RATIONS AND EVEN RESORT TO TACTICS LIKE TARGETING FARMWORKERS JIMMY'S THERE ALREADY BEEN HEAVILY IMPACTED BY COVE IN NINETEEN AND NEED THE VACCINE THE MOST. ADDITIONALLY WELL WE ARE JUST GIVING VACCINES IN MANY TRADITIONAL HEALTH CARE SETTINGS LIKE HOSPITALS AND DOCTORS OFFICES PHARMACIES. WE ALSO KNOW WE NEED TO USE NONTRADITIONAL SITE LOCATIONS WE NEED TO GO OUT COMMUNITIES BE ON SCHOOL CAMPUSES PARKING LOTS PERHAPS- MALLS OTHER TYPES OF PLACES WHERE WE- ARE- CREATING. NEW LOGISTICAL SITUATIONS THAT MIGHT BILL SEEKS TO ADDRESS. THE OPPONENTS OF THE BILL WELL ARGUED OR TRIED TAKE AWAY FREE SPEECH HOWEVER THIS IS A FALSE CHOICE THEY WANT TO BOXES INTO. WE CERTAINLY CAN CREATE PROPERTIES OF FREE SPEECH AND ENSURE PEOPLE OF ACCESS TO VACCINES FREE FROM INTIMIDATION. AND BOSS OF THE PRIVACY.

EDUCATION IS ONE OF THE INTEGRAL RIGHTS IN MODERN SOCIETY BUT OUR ABILITY TO RECEIVE A STATE OF EDUCATION ACTION TRYING TO THE INTERNATIONAL COVENANT ON ECONOMIC SOCIAL AND CULTURAL RIGHTS.

AND WITH THAT READ NOW WILL HAVE THE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION MATTHEW MAKE RENTALS THE PACIFIC JUSTICE INSTITUTE HE'LL BE IN BY PHONE. AND JOSHUA COLEMAN V. IS FOR A VACCINE WHO'S HERE IN PERSON FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND. YOU MAKE GO TO THE BIKE WILL WILL BEGIN WITH THE IN PERSON. IN PERSON TESTIMONY HERE TO REJECT YOU BOTH HAVE IS FIVE MINUTES ALTOGETHER SO WHAT. PLEASE LEAVE SOME TIME FOR. COMMITMENT RENTALS. HI MY NAME IS JOSHUA COLEMAN AND I'M A CO FOUNDER OF V. IS FOR VACCINE THE WORLD'S LARGEST VACCINE RISK PUBLIC EDUCATION ORGANIZATION. WHAT WE DO SPECIFICALLY IS PROVIDE GUIDANCE AND FACT BASED MESSAGING TO ACTIVISTS ACROSS THE WORLD THAT WANT TO GO OUT AND EDUCATE THE PUBLIC ABOUT THE REAL RISKS OF VACCINATION. LIKE EVERYTHING IN THIS WORLD VACCINES OF DO HAVE A RISK AND IT'S IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLETO KNOW WHAT THEY'RE GETTING INTO BEFORE CONSENTING. THE NEWS ORGANIZATION PROJECT VERITAS RECENTLY HAD MULTIPLE WHISTLEBLOWERS FROM FACEBOOK. COME FORWARD EXPOSING INTERNAL DOCUMENTS SHOWING THAT FACEBOOK ACTIVELY CENSORS CONTENT THAT IS CONSIDERED VACCINE HESITANT. MEANING THEY CENSOR ANYTHING THAT IS CONSIDERED NEGATIVE ABOUT VACCINATION. OR COULD MAKE A PERSON VACCINE HESITANT. AND FACEBOOK SPECIFIED IN THESE DOCUMENTS THEY DO THIS WHETHER THE INFORMATION IS TRUE OR NOT. I BELIEVE THE ACTUAL INTENTION OF THIS BILL IS AN EXTENSION OF THE SAME CENSORSHIP THAT IS HAPPENING ON FACEBOOK AND OTHER SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS. I DO NOT THINK THIS BILL HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH PEOPLE INTIMIDATING OR BULLYING PEOPLE AT VACCINATION AREAS. THE INCIDENT THAT CENTER PAN KEEPS BRINGING UP AT DODGER STADIUM DID NOT HAVE ACTIVISTS BLOCKING THE ENTRANCE. THE CHIEF OF POLICE IN L. A. COUNTY MADE IT A POINT TO ISSUE A PUBLIC STATEMENT AFTERWARDS SAYING THE PROTESTS DID NOT SHUT DOWN THE VACCINATION SITE. ALL APPOINTMENTS WERE MET. EVEN CNN SAID THE GATHERING WAS PEACEFUL NO ARRESTS WERE MADE. SENATOR PAN HAS SHOWED HIS CARDS HERE BY DEFINING THE WORD HARASS IN SB SEVEN FOUR TWO. AS EDUCATION. DISPLAYING A SIGN TO FOR PASSING A LEAFLET OR HAND BILL. THOSE THREE THINGS ARE NOT HARASSING. IF SOMEONE TAKES A FLYER FROM AN ACTIVIST IT IS ACCEPTED. NO ONE CAN FORCE THE FLYER ON TO SOMEONE AND FORCE THEM TO READ IT WHEN AN INDIVIDUAL WALKS AWAY WITH THE FLYER FROM ONE OF OUR ACTIVISTS. IT'S BECAUSE THEY OF THEIR OWN FREE WILL HAVE ACCEPTED IT. THE BILL IS ATTEMPTING TO STOP THAT FROM HAPPENING. I BELIEVE THE TRUE INTENTION OF THIS BILL IS TO JUST LIKE FACEBOOK BLOCKED THE DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION ON VACCINE RISK DESPITE ITS VALIDITY. IF THIS IS NOT THE INTENTION OF THE BILL I WOULD KINDLY ASK THE AUTHOR TO REMOVE THE PART THAT DEFINES HARASSMENT. AS EDUCATION. DISPLAYING A SIGN TO AND PASSING A LEAFLET OR HAND BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR. IS TO MAKE BACKGROUND. THE PHONE YET THANK YOU AND GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS BASS MAKE REYNOLDS IN THE HALF- PACIFIC JUSTICE INSTITUTE'S CENTER FOR PUBLIC POLICY- FIRST WANT TO COMMEND THE COMMITTEE AND THE STAFF FOR RECOGNIZING A NUMBER OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROBLEMS WITH- THE BILL AS IT EXISTED PRIOR TO THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS AND UNFORTUNATELY EVEN THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS- FALL FAR SHORT OF CURING THE SIGNIFICANT AND CONSTITUTIONALITY THAT WE FIND IN THIS BILL. IT IS SUBSTANTIALLY OVERBROAD WE SEEN IT SHIFTING RATIONALES WHERE IT BEGAN BY RELYING ON FUNERAL PROTEST LAWS AND NOW HAS SHIFTED TO- LARGELY ABORTION RELATED JURISPRUDENCE AND BUT EVEN IN RELATION TO THE ABORTION CLINICS THE U. S. SUPREME COURT HAS NEVER UPHELD A BUFFER ZONE AS RESTRICTIVE AS THE ONE NOW BEFORE THIS BODY. NOR AT TO UNDERSCORE THE POINT MADE BY THE PRIOR OPPOSITION WITNESS HAS A SUPREME COURT EVER COME CLOSE TO UPHOLDING A DEFINITION OF HARASSED THAT IS AKIN TO THE ONE BEING PUT FORWARD TO THIS COMMITTEE NOW AT THIS BILL WOULD REACH FAR BEYOND THE COVERT CRISIS WOULD REACH FAR BEYOND IT BEING ALLEGED HARM IS ITS PURPORTED BASIS AND WHAT EVEN RESTRICT- EVERYTHING FROM LABOR PROTEST TO BLACK LIVES MATTER PROTEST ANIMAL RIGHTS ACTIVISM. AS WELL AS PRO LIFE SPEECH OUTSIDE OF CLINICS AS WELL AS IN TRADITIONAL PUBLIC FORUMS WE JUST URGE THE COMMITTEE IN CLOSING TO LISTEN BEYOND THE EMOTIONS AND THE HEATED RHETORIC THAT OFTEN CAN ACCOMPANY THIS TOPIC AND TO LOOK CLOSELY AT THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THIS BILL AND- WE BELIEVE YOU'LL. FIND THAT THIS MEASURE CANNOT SURVIVING THE COR AND SHOULD BE THERE FOR RICH THAT COMMITTEE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER MCREYNOLDS MISTER COLEMAN YOUR WITHIN THE FIVE MINUTES OR COMMITTEE APPRECIATES THAT UP WE NOW WILL GO. TO THE PHONE LINES WELL.

THANKS FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX THANK GOD. WE HAD NO ADDITIONAL COMMENT THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL NOW BRING YOU BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. FOR ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS IT WILL BEGIN WITH THE DOCTOR COURT. WELL I WILL BE VOTING FOR THIS BILL TODAY- HOWEVER I DO THINK THE OPPOSITION HAS SOME POINTS FIRST OF ALL THE THIRTY FOOT DISTANCE. THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO EVIDENCE I KNOW OF AND I'VE BEEN LOOKING THAT YOU CAN TRANSMIT OVER THIRTY FEET OUTSIDE THAT YOU CAN TRANSMIT A- ARE COVERED AND YOU'RE PRIMARILY CONCERNED ABOUT THE COVETED VACCINES AND YOU SET IT AT THIRTY. FRANKLY IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO DO THAT EVEN INDOORS YOU CAN DO IT WITH SPECIALLY IF THE VENTILATION IS SET UP JUST RIGHT. BUT I REALLY DON'T THINK THAT THAT MEASURE AND PROBABLY SOME OF THE OTHERS THAT YOU HAVE IN THE BILL WOULD SURVIVE A COURT CHALLENGE SO. AGAIN I WILL BE VOTING FOR TODAY BUT I'D SUGGEST THAT YOU CHANGE THE BILL- I'M MOVED TO BAIL. DO YOU REMEMBER. QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. SHE NINETY MAKE COSTA RICA THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH SHARE NINE I THANK ALL THE MEMBERS FOR YOUR PATIENCE AND APPRECIATE- YOU'RE LISTENING TO ALL THE TESTIMONY- I THAT- DUCTWORK I HAVE TREMENDOUS RESPECT FOR YOU- I THINK THAT SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT HAVE COME UP IN TERMS OF DISTANCE- I MEAN THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE JUST QUIETLY STANDING THERE WAVING SIGNS RIGHT AND WE SAW IT FOR EXAMPLE AND- DODGER STADIUM- THAT THEY WERE COMING UP AND SCREAMING AT. PEOPLE YELLING- SO WE KNOW THAT WHEN PEOPLE YELL OR SAYING SO WHAT THE PROJECT VOICE YOU HAVE MUCH GREATER TRANSMISSION- THIS DOES APPLY I MEAN WE HAVE INDOORS AND OUTDOORS SO IT DOES HAVE IT DOES DEPENDS TO A CERTAIN EXTENT ON VENTILATION BUT ALSO POINT OUT THAT. WHEN YOU HEAR FROM THE USE RIGHT- YEAH WHAT WE DON'T WANT TO DO IS CREATE A SITUATION WHERE PEOPLE ARE AFRAID TO GO GET THEIR VACCINES BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THE INTENT OF THE JUST YOU KNOW THE EXTREMISTS OURS ACTUALLY TO DISCOURAGE PEOPLE FROM GETTING BACK TO THE PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY WANT TO GET VACCINATED. AND TO DISCOURAGE THEM IN FACT I FIND IT QUITE TELLING THAT- SOME OF THE PEOPLE INCLUDING THE LEAD WITNESS IN OPPOSITION AS A PERSON WHO HAS A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE AND HARASSMENT AND ACTUALLY IS PLANNING ON FACEBOOK TODAY HAVE YOU TALK ABOUT SUCH A FACEBOOK DIRECTLY SAID D. HAVE DIRECT PEOPLE TO GO TO VACCINATION SITES AND CONDUCT- THESE TYPES OF ACTIVITIES PROBABLY HOPING WAITING TILL THIS BILL HOPEFULLY. HOPING THAT THIS BILL BE DEFEATED SO THAT THEY COULD DO IT WITHOUT TRIGGERING IS MORE SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL SO I AM CONCERNED AND I THINK YOU'VE HEARD FROM THE WITNESSES SUPPORT THE USE THAT THEY ARE YOU KNOW THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE NERVOUS ABOUT THE FACT THAT- DAY WOULD BE HARASSED AND- AND ATTACKED FLOORED JUST TRYING TO. PROTECT THEMSELVES AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT NEVER WOULD REALLY WANT TO THANK- THE- COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING AND- SO I THINK ADDRESSING MANY OF THE ISSUES A CONSTITUTIONAL OTHERWISE ACTUALLY- STAFF ON BOTH BOTH. A GUIDE TO MAKE DEMOCRAT AL COMMITTEE STAFF AND RIVER. STAFF REALLY DO APPRECIATE THE WORK- WE WANT YOU KNOW WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. THIS BILL IS REALLY. ACTIVE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO GET VACCINATED SHOULD BILL GET VACCINATED WITHOUT BEING HARASSED. BUT BEING INTIMIDATED. AND ALSO WE ALSO PROTECT FREE SPEECH. AND THIS IS HOW WE'RE GOING TO GET OUT OF THE PANDEMIC. THERE'S NOTHING IN THIS BILL THAT TO PREVENT SOMEONE FROM. US GOING AND SAYING WHAT THEY WANT TO SAY- IN APPROPRIATE PLACES WHAT WE DON'T WANT TO DO. IS- PREVENT PEOPLE WHO CHOOSE TO GET IT FROM BEING ABLE TO GET VACCINATED. AND WE ALWAYS SAY THAT YOU KNOW YOU'RE YOU'RE RIGHT TO SWING YOUR FIST STOPS AT THE PERSON'S NOSE AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT. AND SO WITH THAT- I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AYE VOTE AND AGAIN THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR- YOUR CONSIDERATION. IN THE- BUT OUT OF PERSONAL PRIVILEGE. JUST BECAUSE WE HAD MEMBERS THAT WEREN'T HERE IF YOU ALLOW IT. ANY TO MEMBERS THAT WORK. BEFORE WE ENDED. FURTHER OF THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AVERAGE GIVE ME. IF GIVEN THEM AN OPPORTUNITY IF YOU WANTED TO. ASK QUESTIONS YOU'RE GOOD GOOD GOOD DIMMER WE'RE GOOD. SO WITH THAT- IS SHARMA THANK YOU FOR. WORKING WITH- BOTH PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE THE SENATE. BECAUSE THAT FOR US- THAT DEFINITELY- REAL CONCERN THAT WE GO THROUGH ALL OF THIS. YOU'RE ALL THIS TESTIMONY. AND IT GETS CHALLENGED IN COURT ON A FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHT CONSTANT THAT'S WHY YOU GOT. SO MUCH SUPPORT AND- END UP AMENDMENTS FROM BOTH COMMITTEES TO ENSURE THAT BECAUSE THAT'S VERY VERY IMPORTANT TO US THAT- WE DON'T VIOLATE THAT AND SO I THANK YOU FOR ACCEPTING- THOSE SUBMIT. AMENDMENTS- I THINK WITH WHAT DOCTOR CORP BROUGHT UP- IT'S A MATTER OF. JUST YOU KNOW PASSED. THAT'S OUT OF MY- FIELD- AS FAR AS MAY. HOW FOR. SOMEONE TO BE A PART FORTY. CONTRACT THIS LAST YEAR WE'RE LEARNING MORE ABOUT CONTRACTING. VIRUSES DID WE- EVER KNEW BEFORE AND- IS WE'D BE DEPENDING ON THE CDC PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS. AND SO AT THE I THINK IF YOU WERE TO PROVIDE. THE DATA THE VERIFICATION OF MEDICAL REASONING FOR WHY YOU YOU HAD THAT I THINK THAT WILL. THAT WILL HELP ASSUAGE WHO IF NOT ALL SOME PEOPLE'S CONCERNS ABOUT THAT THE DISTANCE. AS WITHOUT THE CHAIRED RECOMMENDED AIBO. CALDERON ON SB SEVEN FORTY TWO BY SENATOR HAND THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER JONES SAWYER AYE LACKEY. LACKEY NEL BARRICADE HAND BARRICADE HAD A LEAK LEAK I WORK HARD WORK I SANTIAGO. C. R. TELL NO C. R. TURNOUT WICKS WICKS I. THE MEASURE PASS. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WILL NOT GO ON TO- ITEMS- ACTUALLY ITEMS TO AND FOUR SB SEVEN ONE ZERO BRADFORD DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S CONFLICTS OF INTEREST AND IT ITEM NUMBER FOUR SB FIVE SIX SEVEN BRADFORD CRIMINAL PROCEDURE SENTENCING. AND MR BREAST CENTER BRADFORD WHICHEVER ONE YOU WANT TO BEGIN WITH- YOU HAVE YOUR DISK YOUR IT'S AT YOUR DISCRETION I'M GONNA START WITH SEVEN CHANCES MY WITNESSES ARE READY SO. YOUR ANCESTRY FOR A MEASURE THAT WOULD ADDRESS THE CONFLICT OF INTEREST BETWEEN PROSECUTORS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS WHO HAVE COMMITTED MISCONDUCT ON DUTY THIS BILL REQUIRED TO DISTRICT ATTORNEY TO HAVE RECEIVED MONETARY BENEFITS FROM AN ASSOCIATION THAT SOLELY REPRESENTS LAW ENFORCEMENT TO RECUSE HIMSELF. FROM THE INVESTIGATION CHARGING AND PROSECUTION OF OFFICERS THAT THAT MEMBER IS A PART OF THAT ASSOCIATION ADDITIONALLY THE BILL APPLIES IF THAT ASSOCIATION PROVIDES REPRESENTATION FOR THAT OFFICER IN THE CRIMINAL CASE. AFTER RECUSING THEMSELVES ATTORNEY GENERAL SHALL ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CASE AND IF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL HAS A CONFLICT THEN THEY WILL ASSIGN A SPECIAL PROSECUTOR. BOTH STATE LAW IN THE STATE BAR RULES OF PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT ADDRESS HOW ATTORNEY SHOULD RESPOND WHEN FACED WITH A CONFLICT OF INTEREST BUT THEY'RE UNCLEAR WITH THIS SPECIFIC TYPE OF SITUATION PROSECUTORS SOME OF THE MOST POWERFUL ACTORS. IN OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM AND THEIR ROLE IS UNIQUE. AND UNLIKE MOST ELECTED OFFICIALS- DUTIES AS TO FOR AND IN FOR THE LAW NOT SOME MAKE POLICY CHOICES. THAT BEING SAID. THIS RETURNEES HOLD A FUNDAMENTAL ROLE IN HOLDING BAD OFFICERS ACCOUNTABLE YET MANY TIMES OFFICERS IN THE STATE SERIOUSLY HARM KILL HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE EVERY YEAR AND ALMOST NONE OF THEM EVER FONG CRIMINAL LIBEL. MOSSO MARTIN NEVER EVEN CHARGED AS A RESULT. COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT OUR STATE ARE RIGHTFULLY CRITICAL OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE DISTRICT ATTORNEYS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT ASSOCIATIONS ESPECIALLY WHEN THAT ASSOCIATION DONATES TO DISTRICT ATTORNEYS AND AS FINANCING COUNSEL FOR THOSE BAD OFFICERS THIS IS A CLEAR UP THE CODE ISSUE AND OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM WILL BE. BETTER FOR. AND IN BENEFIT GREATLY BY ADDRESSING THIS CONFLICT OF INTEREST THIS BILL DOES NOT. MEMBERS STATE DOES NOT PREVENT ANY OFFICER FROM RECEIVING A FAIR AND IMPARTIAL TRIAL. THIS BILL DOES NOT PREVENT LAW ENFORCEMENT UNIONS FROM DONATING TO DISTRICT ATTORNEY CANDIDATES. NOR DOES IT FORBID JUST RETURNING FROM ACCEPTING THOSE CONTRIBUTIONS IT ONLY REQUIRES THOSE ATTORNEYS TO RECUSE THEMSELVES FROM THAT CRIMINAL CASE. REMOVING ANY OPPORTUNITY FOR BIAS OR FAVORITISM. TESTIFYING TODAY IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE. ARE TO DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S FIRST WE HAD DISTRICT ATTORNEY FROM SAN FRANCISCO CHASE THE BODINE AND AFTER WHICH WILL HAVE DISTRICT ATTORNEY FROM LOS ANGELES GEORGE GAS CONE. BOTH OF WHOM ARE MEMBERS OF THE PROSECUTOR LINES OF CALIFORNIA AND THE SPONSORS OF THIS MEASURE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. THANK YOU SO IN SUPPORT WILL BEGIN WITH THE SAN FRANCISCO DISTRICT ATTORNEY CHESTER BODINE AND THEN WILL. GO TO DALY COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY GEORGE GASCON MISTER BODINE OPERATOR WE OPEN UP THE LINE. GOOD MORNING AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE MY VIEWS THANK YOU FOR THE WALK WITH ALL OF YOU DO TO MAKE SAN FRANCISCO CA FOR MORE FAIR. MY NAME IS JASON ROUTINES ARE DIRECTED DISTRICTS. OF SAN FRANCISCO AND I'M ONE OF THE FOUNDERS OF THE PROSECUTORS ALLIANCES CALIFORNIA. WE ARE PROUD TO SPONSOR SENATE BILL SEVEN TEN BY SENATOR GRASSLEY- YEAH I WANT TO ECHO MANY OF THE COMMENTS AND I KNOW THEY MADE UP AND DOWN THE STATE ABOUT THE NEEDS OF THIS BILL. I WOULD LIKE TO BRIEFLY ADDRESS SOME OF THE ARGUMENTS. THAT WE HAVE HEARD IN OPPOSITION. THIS BILL IS. TAILORED ADVANSIX. STATE INTEREST. IN THE ENTIRE OF OUR JUDICIAL. AND FAIR TREATMENT FOR ALL THAT AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS. ALSO ALWAYS CLAIM THAT WE ARE INFRINGING ON THE FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS TO ENGAGE IN POLITICAL SPEECH TO CONTRIBUTE TO A CAMPAIGN OF ADA CANADA THEIR CHOICE I WANT TO BE CLEAR SENATE BILL CLINTON DOES NOT LIMIT THE ABILITY OF LAW ENFORCEMENT ASSOCIATIONS TO CONTRIBUTE TO CANDIDATES. ACROSS YOUR LAWSUIT YOUR SAYS THE BILL LIMIT THE ABILITY OR THE RIGHT TO DA CANDIDATES. LOOKS AFTER. THE BILL PROVIDE. THAT IN CASES AND ON MY CRIME COME ON DUTY OFFICER THE DA RECUSANTS FROM THE INTO. YES ONLY YES THE LONG ASSOCIATION ALSO PROVIDES REPRESENTATION TO THE OFFICER IN THE CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION. BOTH SONGS MUST BE MET. YES MUST HAVE GIVEN A MONETARY BENEFIT DIRECTLY TO THE AGE LONG INVESTIGATION AND YES- SOLUTION MUST BE PROVIDING REPRESENTATION TO THE OFFICER BEING INVESTIGATED AND THE REMEDY IN THAT SITUATION IS SIMPLY REFUSAL OF THE DA FROM THE INVESTIGATION OR PROSECUTION. THIS TAILORED LAW IS AIMED AT ADVANCING A COMPELLING STATE INTERESTS THAT IS MAINTAINING PUBLIC CONFIDENCE. IN THE INTEGRITY OF PROSECUTORS IN THEIR INVESTIGATIONS OF POLICE WRONGDOING. THE ALL TO COMMON AFTER PROSECUTORS ACCEPTING CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT ASSOCIATION AND THEN FAILING TO HOLD ACCOUNTABLE MEMBERS OF THOSE SAME ASSOCIATIONS FOR- APPARENTLY CRIMINAL ACTS CORRODES PUBLIC TRUST IN AN INSTITUTION WHOSE LEGITIMACY HINGES ON PUBLIC FACE IN ITS FAIRNESS AND IMPARTIALITY FILING. THE OPPOSITION ALSO POINTS OUT. THAT NUMBER IS OF LEGISLATIVE BODIES DO NOT HAVE TO RECUSE THEMSELVES FROM VOTING ON ISSUES RELATED TO ENTITIES THAT HAVE DONATED TO THEIR CAMPAIGNS. BUT PROSECUTORS SURVEY PUBLIC DUTY DISTINCT FROM OTHER ELECTED OFFICIALS WE ARE ADMINISTRATORS OF JUSTICE AND WE ARE TURNING HELLO A HIGHER STANDARD THAN ANY OTHER ELECTED OFFICIAL WE MUST HOLD ANYONE WHO BREAKS THE LAW ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR ACTIONS EVEN IF. THEIR FELLOW LAW ENFORCEMENT. IT IS A PARA IMPORTANCE THAT THE PUBLIC TRUST US TO CARRY OUT THOSE DUTIES FAIRLY IMPARTIALLY SENATE BILL SEVEN TEN IS CRITICAL TO BUILDING THAT TRUST THANK YOU AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU D. A DE CASTRO. AT&amp;T OPERATOR. K. ARMS YEAH CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW YES. RIGHT GOOD MORNING MEMBERS OF THE CANADIAN THANK YOU TO ENSURE FOR CARRYING THIS BILL.

THE NATION WIDE DEMONSTRATIONS OVER THERE GEORGE FLOORINGS AND BRIANNA TAYLOR AND COUNTLESS OTHERS HAVE MADE IT CLEAR TO LAW ENFORCEMENT FACES A CRISIS OF LEGITIMACY. NOT JUST THE POLICE. IT IS ALSO ACROSS ON THE COURT WILL OFTEN FAILING OPEN LOOK. WHEN THEY BREAK THE LAW. WHEN PEOPLE AND BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES SEE THEIR LOVED ONES CALL OFF TO JAIL FOR MINOR OFFENSES. AND THEN WALKED FOR USE OFFICERS KILLED MEMBERS OF THEIR COMMUNITIES WILL NOT FACING ANY CRIMINAL CONSEQUENCES. IT'S NOT SURPRISING THE PEOPLE CONCLUDE. THAT THE SYSTEM IS RIGGED AGAINST. SB SEVEN PENN WILL ADDRESS ONE OF THE ALL TO COMMON PRACTICE THE CONTRIBUTES TO THIS PERCEPTION. THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OPINION MONETARY BENEFITS ON THE SEND LAW ENFORCEMENT SO C. H. IN. THE REPRESENTS THE OFFICERS THAT THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO HOLD THE ACCOUNT. REGARDLESS OF THE PROSECUTORS IN PENSIONS THE FINANCIAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PROSECUTORS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT SOLICITATIONS FOR ROADS CROSS IN ORDER FOR SHELL OF THE- BUSH SERIOUSLY UNDERMINES THE LEGITIMACY OF THE ENTIRE CRIMINAL. JUSTICE SYSTEM. AS ATTORNEYS WERE HELD TO THE ETHICAL STANDARDS REGARDING CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. BUT THERE ARE CRITICAL GAPS IN THE STANDARDS THE RESULT IN A LOOPHOLE FOR THE SITUATION.

I'M NOT SURE WHICH CLIENT IS. RIGHT HERE IN THE ROOM SO MANY. UP GO AHEAD LARRY MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU SIR- MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS LARRY MORSE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION AND RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION TO SENATE BILL SEVEN TEN THIS BILL SINGLES OUT DISTRICT ATTORNEYS AMONG ALL ELECTED OFFICIALS AS BEING INCAPABLE OF RECONCILING THEIR ETHICAL DUTIES BUT HAVING RECEIVED POLITICAL SUPPORT IN THIS CASE FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT ORGANIZATIONS. WHY WOULD BE AS BE HELD TO A DIFFERENT STANDARD THE MEMBERS OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE MOST OF THEM ROUTINELY SOLICIT SIGNIFICANT CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS FROM A VAST ARRAY OF SPECIAL INTEREST TO HAVE BUSINESS IN THE LEGISLATURE AND THEN VOTE ON THEIR BILLS WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ELECTED DA RECEIVING THE FINANCIAL SUPPORT OF A LAW ENFORCEMENT UNION IN HIS OR HER COUNTY AND THEN CLEARLY AND ETHICALLY ASSESSING A SUBSEQUENT OFFICER INVOLVED SHOOTING CASE. AND A MEMBER OF THE LEGISLATURE ACCEPTING CONTRIBUTIONS THROUGHOUT HIS OR HER CAREER FROM SAY UTILITY INTERESTS AND THEN VOTING ON LEGISLATION REGULATING THOSE SAME UTILITIES PRACTICALLY SPEAKING NOT WE WOULD NOT SUGGEST THAT JUST BECAUSE A MEMBER OF THE LEGISLATURE IS TAKING CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS FROM SPECIAL INTERESTS HERE SHE IS RENDERED INCAPABLE OF VOTING HIS OR HER CONSCIENCE ON A BILL AFFECTING THAT SPECIAL INTERESTS. YET THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THIS BILL TELLS ELECTED DISTRICT ATTORNEYS WHY IS THE BILL SINGLE OUT ONLY LAW ENFORCEMENT CONTRIBUTIONS THE SPONSORS OF THIS BILL INCLUDING MY FRIEND BE ABLE BEING FROM SAN FRANCISCO LA DA GEORGE GASC DON'T HAVE BEEN ACTIVELY AND FINANCIALLY SUPPORTED BY DEFENSE BAR INTEREST BUT THE BILL DOES NOT PROHIBIT THEM FROM INVESTIGATING OR PROSECUTING AN OFFICER INVOLVED SHOOTING WHERE THOSE SAME MEMBERS OF THE DEFENSE BAR HAVE A KEEN INTEREST IN WHETHER CHARGES ARE FILED. THIS WOULD SEEM AN EGREGIOUS DOUBLE STANDARD AT BEST MISTER GASTON SUPPORT IS NOT SURPRISING GIVEN THE NEAR UNANIMOUS OPPOSITION TO HIS POLICIES BY LAW ENFORCEMENT. ACROSS CALIFORNIA IT'S DRAMATIC RIGHT CRIME RATES. AS WE READ THE BILL OF THE DISTRICT DID NOT RECEIVE POLITICAL CONTRIBUTIONS FROM THE LOCAL PEACE OFFICERS ASSOCIATION OR DEPUTY SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION BUT DID RECEIVE A CONTRIBUTION FOR THE POOR ACT A STATEWIDE ASSOCIATION WHICH HAS MEMBERS IN BOTH THE LOCAL SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT AND LOCAL POLICE AGENCIES THE DA WOULD BE DEEMED TO HAVE A CONFLICT OF INTEREST AND THUS PRECLUDED FROM CONDUCTING OFFICER INVOLVED SHOOTING INVESTIGATION IN ANY AGENCY THAT HAS PORAC MEMBERS. UNDER THIS BILL WHAT OFFICER INVOLVED SHOOTING THE CURSE D. A. WOULD BE COMPELLED TO REVIEW OR OR HIS CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS TO DETERMINE WHAT IF ANY POLICE ASSOCIATION SUPPORTED HIS OR HER CANDIDACY AND GET THAT OFFICER WAS A MEMBER OF ANY OF THEM. THE BILL IF APPROVED WOULD BE GUARANTEED TO DRAMATICALLY INCREASE THE NUMBER OF OFFICER INVOLVED SHOOTING CASES THAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL WILL SOON BE INVESTIGATING UNDER LAST YEAR'S AB FIFTEEN OH SIX MOREOVER YOU WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY HAVE SITUATIONS WHERE IN WHICH BOTH AN AG AND THE LOCAL VA RECEIVED CONTRIBUTIONS FROM PORAC OR OTHER STATEWIDE LAW ENFORCEMENT ASSOCIATION. IN SUCH CASES THE DA WILL NOT BE ABLE TO DEDUCT THE- I. S. INVESTIGATION NOR WILL BE ATTORNEY GENERAL WILL THEN BE COMPELLED TO RETAIN A SPECIAL PROSECUTOR TO CUT INDUCTEE INVESTIGATION IF THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY DOESN'T WANT TO ACCEPT CONTRIBUTIONS FROM PUBLIC SAFETY ORGANIZATIONS THEN HERE SHE CAN BE QUITE. WELL AS WOULD MEMBERS OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE DISTRICT ATTORNEY STRENUOUSLY OBJECT TO THE APPLICATION THAT THEY CANNOT DISCHARGE THEIR ALEXA DUTIES FAITHFULLY AND WITHOUT FEAR OR FAVOUR NO MATTER WHO HAS SUPPORTED THEIR CAMPAIGN FOR OFFICE WE SUPPORT THE TRANSPARENCY OF RECORDING ALL CONTRIBUTIONS TO ELECTED OFFICIALS INCLUDING DA'S AND BELIEVE THE VOTERS CAN DEPART DECIDE FOR THEMSELVES JUST AS THEY WOULD WITH MEMBERS OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE WHO ACCEPT CAMPAIGN. CONTRIBUTIONS WHETHER ANY OFFICIAL ARE TO VOTE PHONE TO. WE THE BILL SIGNIFICAN COST CHALLENGES AS WELL IN THE CALIFORNIA COURT CASE WOODLAND RESIDENTS ASSOCIATION VERSUS CITY COUNCIL OF LOS ANGELES THE COURT NOTED THAT QUOTE POLITICAL CONTRIBUTIONS INVOLVED IN EXERCISE OF FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOMS PROTECTED BY THE FIRST AMENDMENT TO THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION AND ARTICLE ONE SECTION TWO OF THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION. THIS BILL IS DANGEROUS ARBITRARY INCONSISTENT AND UNCONSTRUCTED UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A NO VOTE THANK. OKAY MISTER SHERMAN I'M A GIVE YOU EXTERMINATOR THOUGH MR MORE SAID ALMOST ALL YOUR TIME TO. I'LL TRY TO BE BRIEF YEAH. MISTER CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE MEMBERS RIGHT SHERMAN ON BEHALF OF THE FOLLOWING PUBLIC EMPLOYEE LABOR UNIONS THAT REPRESENT PEACE OFFICERS INCLUDING THE RIVERSIDE SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION LOS ANGELES SCHOOL POLICE ASSOCIATION AND POLICE OFFICER ASSOCIATIONS FROM THE CITIES OF CLAREMONT CORONA HOMEOWNER PALS FORTIES NEWPORT BEACH. BURBANK UPLAND SANTA ANA RIVERSIDE INGLEWOOD ARCADIA IN CULVER CITY THESE PUBLIC EMPLOYEE LABOR UNIONS REPRESENTING POLICE OFFICERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE ARE UNITED IN STRONG OPPOSITION S. B. TEN WE BELIEVE THIS BILL DECLARES A LEGAL FICTION OF CONFLICT OF INTEREST IN AN EFFORT TO RESTRICT POLITICAL SPEECH A PUBLIC EMPLOYEE LABOR UNIONS REPRESENT PEACE OFFICERS. THAT'S WITHIN SIX TO. ZERO SB SEVEN TEN SIXTEEN PREVENT PUBLIC EMPLOYEE LABOR UNIONS REPRESENTING PEACE OFFICERS FROM MAKING CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS TO A DISTRICT ATTORNEY OR ATTORNEY GENERAL. THE FINDINGS AND DECLARATIONS OF THIS BILL MAKE THAT GOAL QUITE CLEAR RESULTING IN SB TENSE DUBIOUS CONSTITUTIONALITY- MR MORE AID MENTION THE OTHER ISSUES CONCERNING FREE SPEECH- AND UNDER CURRENT LAW CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS ARE CURRENTLY LIMITED TO PREVENT AN ACTUAL OR PERCEIVED CONFLICT OF INTEREST. ARE CAPPED AT FORTY NINE HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR LEGISLATIVE ELECTIONS IN EIGHTY ONE HUNDRED FOR NAY G. RACE. FURTHERMORE WE BELIEVE SB TEN IMPERMISSIBLY LIMITS THE AG'S CONSTITUTIONAL POWERS AND PROHIBITS THE AG FROM PERFORMING THEIR PRESCRIBED OVERSIGHT DUTIES PURSUANT TO ARTICLE FIVE SECTION THIRTEEN OF CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION. EVEN IF THE AG ACCEPTS THE FIVE DOLLAR CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION. THE EATER. SB SEVEN TEN WILL OF CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEYS ANTI POLICE ORGANIZATIONS AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM GROUPS TO CONTRIBUTE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS TO AN AG OR DA CANDIDATE OR OFFICE HOLDER. BUT THOSE CONTRIBUTIONS ARE NOT PRESUME TO CREATE A CONFLICT OF INTEREST. SB SEVEN TEN DECIDES WHO MAY AND WHO MAY NOT DIRECTLY SUPPORT CANDIDATES FOR ELECTIVE OFFICE THIS IS A CLEAR VIOLATION OF CONSTITUTIONALLY PROTECTED RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN THE POLITICAL PROCESS. FOR THESE REASONS AND MANY MORE WE REMAIN STRONGLY OPPOSED SB SEVEN TEN. RESPECTFULLY REQUESTED OVER. THANK YOU. THANK YOU NOW ARE YOU ANY NUMBER BRING IT TO THE OUTSIDE THIRTY ANY OTHERS HELLO MONICA LEAVES THAT MAY BE IN OPPOSITION I WOULD LIKE TO GET THEIR NAME AND ORGANIZATION BEFORE WE GO TO THE PHONE LINES.

COMMENTING QUEUE AT THIS TIME THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE FOR ANY COMMENTS QUESTIONS. I MISSED. YOUR LACKEY AND THEN MR LEE. YEAH THANK YOU MISTER REBEKAH BAR QUE HAN. BURKE. LOOKS LIKE JUST RIGHT BY. YOU HAVE A LINEUP COULD YOU FIRST MR LACKEY OKAY. FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO SAY THAT I HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR YOU CENTER BRADLEY BUT- BRADLEY. BUT I'M OFF TO A GREAT START. PLEASE PLEASE FORGIVE ME I'M NOT THAT THAT'S PART OF THE SECOND TIME I'VE DONE THAT TO YOU HERE WITHIN THE LAST MONTH SO I REALLY GREATLY APOLOGIZE. YOU DESERVE BETTER THAN THAT BUT- I THINK ALSO THE PUBLIC DESERVES BETTER THAN THIS I THINK THAT- IF WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THE PURGE OF CONFLICT OF INTEREST THE BILL SHOULD BE MORE BALANCED. AND EVEN HANDED WHY LIMIT THE CONFLICT TO CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS FROM POLICE GROUPS WHAT ABOUT CONTRIBUTIONS FROM GEORGE SOROS AND MANY OF THE SOCIAL JUSTICE GROUPS SUPPORTING THIS BILL WITH A CLEAR AGENDA. A PROSECUTING MORE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS FOR ALLEGED EXCESSIVE FORCE VIOLATIONS I THINK IT'S IMBALANCED AND IT'S UNFAIRLY FOCUSED. ON FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS OF POLICE GROUPS. SO I WON'T BE ABLE TO SUPPORT. THANK YOU AND DIDN'T MR LEE YOUR NEXT. THANK YOU CENTER BRADFORD I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS AND ALSO MAKING SURE THAT YEAH THOSE WE HOLD WITH HIGH RESPECT TO IT TO ENFORCE OUR LAWS ARE ALSO HELD ACCOUNTABLE WHEN THEY BREAK THEM TO OR IN THE- ABUSE OUR PUBLIC TRUST SO THAT'S WHY I THINK THIS BILL SUPPORT I KNOW WE'VE HAD. SEVERAL CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE INFLUENCE OF CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS THE FACT EARLIER THIS YEAR. AND I'M HAPPY TO HEAR FROM THE OPPOSITION I HAD A MORE WIDE RANGING BANNOCK ON COUNTY CONTRIBUTIONS TO POLITICAL CANDIDATES AND I'M HAPPY TO HAVE THEIR SUPPORT ON IN THE FUTURE. AND DOING SUCH MEASURES LIKE THAT AND WE'VE HAD COME IN CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS BUT I THINK THIS NARROWLY. TAILORED BILL GETS TO THE HEART OF SOMETHING RIGHT. EVEN THE APPEARANCE OF A CONFLICT OF INTEREST WHICH I THINK IT IS. PUTS IDEA'S AND AGES IN A COUPLE POSITION WHERE IF THERE IS SOME SOLUTIONS LIKE THIS IT IS. AND WE'VE HEARD THIS DOCUMENT MANY TIMES THAT UNCOMFORTABLY CHAU PROSECUTING YOUR FRIEND ESSENTIALLY. AND PUTS THEM IN AWKWARD POSITION AND THIS KIND OF MAKES IT SO THAT WE CAN. HAVE THE BEST JUDICIAL PROCESS ALSO WITHOUT THE AWKWARDNESS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. AND GIVES I THINK A MORE FAIR SHOT TO BOTH PARTIES I THINK AND IT'S REPORTING. SO I'M REALLY HAPPY TO SEE THIS BILL I'M BE SUPPORTED TODAY AND I WOULD HOPE TO JOIN AS A CO AUTHOR WHEN. APPROPRIATE THANK YOU THANK YOU SOMEONE WITH. MISS REBECK ABOUT CAYENNE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU SENATOR BRADFORD AND I'M ALSO GOING TO BE SUPPORTING THE BILL FOR MANY OF THE REASONS EXPRESSED BY MY COLLEAGUE. BUT I WOULD LIKE YOU TO ADDRESS THIS QUESTION THAT HAS BEEN POSED ABOUT WHY IT ONLY RELATES TO CHARGING DECISIONS- FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS WHY ISN'T THE BILL BROADER RIGHT IF THERE WERE SOME REASON THAT THEY WOULD NEED TO CHARGE- A PUBLIC DEFENDER AND FOR EXAMPLE IF THE DA SAID YOU HAVE A PROSECUTOR WHO HAS TAKEN. MONEY FROM THE DEFENSE BAR WHY WOULDN'T THAT BE A SIMILAR CONFLICT OF INTEREST I GUESS I JUST. WANNA GIVE YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS SORT OF WHY WE ARE LOOKING AT A BROADER CONFLICT OF INTEREST AT. THE END IT'S A FAIR QUESTION BUT HERE WE ARE TRYING TO. TAKE ONE ISSUE AT A TIME AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT. PROSECUTING A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS ALMOST NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE. DO THIS CONFLICT OF INTEREST AND- THEY HERE IN THIS SITUATION. THIS IS NOT JUST ABOUT TAKING A CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION. AGAIN THE- THESE UNIONS PROVIDE- THE TOURNEY'S IN THE LEGAL DEFENSE FUNDING. FOR THOSE OFFICERS AND WORDS PROSECUTORS DON'T SO I MEAN I DEFENSE ATTORNEYS DON'T SO THAT STICK. THE CLEAR DIFFERENCE THE SAME UNION THAT IS PROVIDING A CONTRIBUTION TO A DA OR- OR THE AG IS AT THE SAME TIME. PAYING FOR THE DEFENSE ATTORNEY FOR THOSE OFFICERS SO THAT'S WHERE THE REAL CONFLICT AND- AND DIFFERENT FROM- EIGHT EIGHT. DEFENSE ATTORNEY. THANK YOU AND AS I SAID I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL AND I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT WORK AND- AS- ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEE SAID. YOU KNOW THERE'S SO LITTLE FAITH RIGHT NOW IN THE SYSTEM AND I THINK THAT THIS IS A STEP IN MAKING SURE THAT WE REBUILD TRUST IN THE DECISIONS THAT ARE BEING MADE. AB BUT I DO THINK IT'S WORTH LOOKING AT IF WE BELIEVE. THIS WILL BE HERE FOR THE FIRST BILL OF YOURS I REALLY CAN'T SUPPORT- I THINK YOU KNOW I GET MONEY FROM LABOR UNIONS. I WROTE ALL THE TIME ON THINGS THAT AFFECT THEM. AND I REALLY DO THINK- IF YOU'RE SUSPICIOUS OF DJS YOU SHOULD BE SUSPICIOUS OF LEGISLATORS. IN TERMS OF WHY THERE AREN'T MORE PROSECUTIONS FIRST OF ALL THE WAY THE LAW WAS WRITTEN IT WAS JUST VERY HARD AND PARTICULARLY INTERPRETATIONS BY THE SUPREME COURT. IT WAS JUST VERY HARD BECAUSE IF THE OFFICER HAD ANY KIND OF JUSTIFIABLE FEAR. YOU COULDN'T PROSECUTE THEM AND SO- ONE OF THE RARE CASES WAS IN ALAMEDA COUNTY WHERE I LIVE WHERE THEY- PROSECUTED SOMEONE WHO SAID THAT HE GRABBED HIS GUN WHEN HE MEANT TO GRAB HIS- TASER. AND ARM AND KILLED THE YOUNG MAN AT A BART STATION. HE WAS PROSECUTED FOR MANSLAUGHTER. ACTUALLY HE WAS PROSECUTED FOR MURDER BUT THEY GOT A CONVICTION FOR MANSLAUGHTER- WE THERE IS A CURRENTLY PROSECUTION GOING ON IN ALAMEDA COUNTY NOW. ARE WITH AND THE ONLY REASON IT'S GOING ON IS THAT WE PASSED A BILL THAT MAKES IT SO YOU HAVE TO GET YOU CAN ONLY USE FORCE WHEN IT'S NECESSARY. AND BECAUSE OF THAT MY DA IS ABLE TO NOW PROSECUTING OFFICER WHO SHOT SOMEONE WHO HAD A BASEBALL BAT. AND YEAH SO I THINK THINGS ARE CHANGING- BUT I DON'T THINK THIS IS A WAY TO PROMOTE MORE CHANGE- THE REASON WHY- PROSECUTORS AND POLICE I THINK. DO YOU OFTEN SEE THINGS THE SAME WAY AS THE NATURE OF WHAT THEY DO IN THE COOPERATION THAT'S BETWEEN THEM. AND I DON'T THINK THIS WILL CHANGE ANY OF THAT SO I WON'T BE VOTING FOR YOUR BILL TODAY I'M SORRY. ANYONE ELSE. HERE TO READ. THANK YOU SENATOR BRADFORD FROM THE REPRESENTING YOUR BILL TODAY AND- YEAH ONE OF THE QUESTIONS I HAVE ABOUT THIS IS. SO THE DA RECUSES HIMSELF WHO PROSECUTES. ARTISTS EITHER TOURNEY GENERAL ATTORNEY GENERAL HAS A CONFLICT AS WELL BILLS ASSIGNORS SPECIALLY GENERAL IS ALSO SUBJECT TO THIS YES SO YOU'RE SAYING GOES FROM FROM THE DA'S OFFICE UP TO THE STATE LEVEL. AND SO AND IF THERE'S A CONFLICT THERE IS A SPECIAL PROSECUTOR. OKAY BECAUSE- YEAH I THINK ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH THIS IS THAT- DATE WE ARE THE OBVIOUSLY IF THE DA HIMSELF. IS SUPPOSEDLY UNDER THIS GUY THE GUYS OF I'M GOING TO NOT BE FAIR AND IMPARTIAL BECAUSE I'VE ACCEPTED CONTRIBUTION. I DON'T KNOW WHERE THAT STOPS IT CERTAINLY DOESN'T STOP ANY ORGANIZATION BECAUSE EVERY WORKS FOR HIM. AND SO WE'RE WE'RE BASICALLY TAKING ALL THESE AND PUTTING THEM INTO SOMEBODY ELSE'S LAP. AND AND LOSING THAT THAT CONTROL OF FOR THAT AREA THAT LOCAL AREA IN THAT COMMUNITY- SO- IT ALSO ASSUMES THAT DID A DA WOULD WANT TO PROTECT. BECAUSE AN ORGANIZATION HAS- SUPPORTED HIM HE WOULD WANT TO PROTECT A ONE ONE BAD OFFICER AND MOST OF THE DA- PROSECUTIONS- THAT I'VE SEEN- OR SITUATIONS WHERE THEY DO HAVE. OFFICERS THAT HAVE- BEEN UNDER INVESTIGATION FOR WHATEVER ISSUE IT IS THERE'S A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF. PUBLICITY INVOLVED IN THOSE AND THERE'S A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF PRESSURE ON THEM- BY ONE GROUP TO PROSECUTE THE HECK OUT OF SOMETHING AND BY THE OTHER TO ADMINISTER A FAIR PROCESS. AND. AND THE MOST OF THE TIME I HAVE SEEN THEM. I LAND- WHERE THE LAW TELLS THEM THEY HAVE TO LAND BECAUSE THAT'S THEIR PROFESSIONAL OBLIGATION TO THE PEOPLE THAT ELECTED THEM IT'S THEIR JOB THE PEOPLE ELECTED THEM TO DO THAT JOB AND I DON'T THINK- THIS. CREATES A SITUATION WHERE THEY'RE THEY'RE GOING TO BE IMPARTIAL AND I HAVE NOT SEEN OUR- YOU KNOW THE- PLA'S UNIONS AT CENTRO WHEN OFFICER BELONGS TO A UNION THEY'RE OBLIGATED BY LAW. TO REPRESENT THEM THAT DOESN'T MEAN THEY WANT A BAD OFFICER TO STAY IN THE RANKS- THEY JUST HAVE TO PAY FOR THE DEFENSE AND THE DEFENSE WILL PUT ON THERE. IT DID ATTORNEY WILL I MEAN THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY WILL PUT ON THEIR CASE- AND I DON'T SEE THAT. IF WE'RE GOING TO ACCUSE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OF BEING- BEING AN ETHICAL BASICALLY BASED ON CONTRIBUTIONS HI DAD AND- I THINK THE CITIZENS WOULD SEE THROUGH THAT AND HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE AT THE BALLOT BOX SO I THINK THAT'S WHERE THE ACCOUNTABILITY IS IT'S WITH THE CITIZENS AND IF YOU HAVE A PROSECUTE AG A DISTRICT ATTORNEY THAT'S NOT GOING TO PROSECUTE ANY POLICE. ISSUES WHEN THERE COULD BE A VERY OBVIOUS CASE A PERSON CAN GET REMOVED IN OFFICE IT'S HAPPENED BEFORE. AND IN DEVICE VERSA TO WHEN SOMEBODY SEES SOMETHING WHERE- OTHER PEOPLE ARE GETTING PROSECUTED. THEY WIND UP GETTING RECALLS OR BOARD REMOVED ENOUGH FROM OFFICE AND EXTEND THE RUN. SO IT'S DIFFICULT FOR ME TO GO DOWN THIS PATH OF MISTRUST OF A DISTRICT ATTORNEY- THEY HAVE AN OATH THEY THEY THEY TAKE AN OATH- TO UPHOLD THE LAW. AND IF THEY DON'T THEY WON'T BE ATTORNEYS BECAUSE OF THE BAR WILL TAKE CARE OF THAT. SO I STRUGGLE WITH THAT THIS IS A STRUGGLE WITH THIS A LOT. AND I DON'T DIE I CAN'T SEE THAT I CAN SUPPORT IT. THANK. ANY OTHER COMMENTS QUESTIONS YOU MAY CLOSE SOONER BRADFORD THANK GOODNESS CHAIRED THANK YOU MEMBERS AND I THINK WE FIND OURSELVES IN A VERY UNIQUE SITUATION FAR DIFFERENT THAN A CITY COUNCIL PERSON FAR DIFFERENT THAN A LEGISLATIVE BODY WHO TAKES A CONTRIBUTION AGAIN WE DON'T DETERMINE LIFE OR DEATH WE DON'T DETERMINE THE BILITY OF SENDING SOMEONE TO AND CHARGING SOMEONE. IF THIS IS A PERFECT WORLD THEN YOU WOULD HAVE MORE THAN 1% OF OFFICERS CHARGED IN LESS THAN THAT CONVICTED IF THIS IS FAIR THERE IS INCESTUOUS RELATIONSHIP THAT EXISTS BETWEEN ONE FOUR SUBMIT NDAS AND JUDGES AND IT'S HISTORICAL AND WE'VE HAD A HUNDRED YEARS UP WE'VE HAD THIRTEEN HUNDRED SHOOTINGS. IN THE LAST TWO YEARS. HOW MANY OFFICERS WERE CHARGED. THIRTEEN WHO WOULDN'T LOVE BILLS OCT ALL THOSE THIRTEEN WHICH CHARGE FROM YOU WERE CONVICTED ONE. I HAVE A NEIGHBOR WHICH ONE IS MOST BRILLIANT. DEFENSE ATTORNEYS PROBABLY AN L. A. COUNTY HAVE NOT TO STATE. HE WAS APPOINTED TO THE BENCH A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO. AFTER TWO YEARS ON THE BENCH HE RESULT HE RESIGNED BECAUSE OF THE INCESTUOUS RELATIONSHIP THAT EXISTED BETWEEN THE D. EIGHT AND THE INVESTIGATORS OF POLICE SHOOTINGS BECAUSE WHO INVESTIGATES POLICE SHOOTINGS OTHER POLICE OFFICERS AND THE MAJORITY OF JUDGES COULD EVEN GET JUDGES TO GO ALONG EVEN IN A GRAND JURY INDICTMENT LIKE TO SAY IT'S EASIER TO INDICT A HAM SANDWICH THAN A- THAN A POLICE OFFICER. AND MY GOOD NEIGHBOR SAID I HAD TO RESIGN FROM THE PRIOR TO GOING TO THE BENCH D. EIGHT. AND IT'S A CLEAR INCESTUOUS RELATIONSHIP. BETWEEN OFFICERS AND ALL WE'RE SEEING IS THAT IF YOU MAKE A CONTRIBUTION. TO A DEAR. TO ATTORNEY GENERAL AND THERE'S A CONFLICT AGAIN IF THERE WAS NOT A CONFLICT YOU WOULD HAVE MORE THAN 1% OF OFFICER BEING CHARGE. LET'S GONNA TALK ABOUT CONVICTED CHARGE WHO DID YOU WRITE THAT OFF. IS TO IN NATURE OF THE RELATIONSHIP THAT HAS EXISTED FOR OVER A HUNDRED YEARS AND IT'S FAR DIFFERENT THAN AGAIN LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIALS AND HERE IN THIS LEGISLATIVE BODY WE ALL TAKE CONTRIBUTIONS THAT WE HAVE TO RECUSE OURSELVES TO CERTAIN AGREED ON A LOT OF THINGS BUT THE CONFLICT THAT EXIST. HERE WHAT LAW ENFORCEMENT IS FAR DIFFERENT AND YES IN THE CONSTITUTION IT'S DATA STATE BAR STATES THAT OFF. A PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT THAT YOU KNOW YOU CAN ADDRESS THOSE CONFLICTS OF INTEREST BUT THERE ARE LOOPHOLES THAT EXIST. AND THAT- GUIDELINES THAT ARE FAR DIFFERENT FROM ANYTHING THAT WE HAVE TO BE ACCOUNTABLE FOR SO IN ORDER TO BUILD TRUST. WE NEED TO HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THIS IS ABOUT TRUST AGAIN. MOST OF THE OFFICERS THE OFFICERS WHO BEAT RODNEY KING WITHIN A IT'S OUR LIFE I DON'T LOST YOUR JOBS THEY'RE STILL WORKING TODAY NO ONE FOUND GUILTY OF ANYTHING AND WE SAW ALL IN LIVING COLOR HOW MANY MORE BRIANNA TAYLOR'S DO WE NEED I MEAN MORE GEORGE FLOYD DOING BUT MOST OF THOSE OFFICERS ARE NEVER CONVICTED IF IT WASN'T FOR VIDEO TAPE DEREK SHOPPING WOULD BE WALKING THE STREETS TODAY. BECAUSE NO DA WOULD HAVE PROSECUTED THIS GUY. NO D. A. WHAT IT CHARGES GOT. THIS IS ABOUT RIGHTING A WRONG THIS IS ABOUT LOOKING AT HISTORICAL PRACTICES THAT EXISTED BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT COMMUNITY AND BUILDING TRUST AND PROVIDING TRANSPARENCY AND MOVIE REMOVING THAT INCESTUOUS RELATIONSHIP THEY CLEARLY EXISTS AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. AND I TO MISTER BRADFORD I THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS YEAR- I THOUGHT LONG AND HARD ABOUT. ACTUALLY ALTERING THIS BILL AND I THOUGHT THAT I WOULD BE A LITTLE. TO RESTRICTIVE WELL WHEN I LOOK AT THIS IT IS THIS TERM PERCEPTION IS REALITY. AND I THOUGHT ABOUT JUDGES AND WE KNOW A LOT OF JUDGES IT CAN'T CONTRIBUTED CAMPAIGNS THEY CAN'T ENDORSE THINGS AND WE HAVE MORE FAITH IN THEIR JUDGMENT. AND WE DO WITH OTHER MEMBERS OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND SO- I THINK THIS BILL IS A MEASURE BILL AND THAT YOU GIVE OPPORTUNITIES. FOR INDIVIDUAL TO STILL CONTRIBUTE AND YOU GIVE THEM STILL OPPORTUNITIES THAT THEY HAVE THEIR VOICE AND TO SPEAK IN THE IN THE POLITICAL SYSTEM- WITHOUT RESTRICTING THEM AND SO- I THINK THIS THIS IS A GOOD COMPROMISE IN IN A LOT OF WAYS. AND THAT- WE SHOULD GO AHEAD AND NOT ONLY BOTH WHICH IS MOVE THIS ALONG. BUT- MAYBE D. A. SHOULD BE AT THE HIGHER RANK OF ART AT THE HIGHER. VISIBILITY OF WHAT THE JUDGES. BUT THAT'S FOR ANOTHER DAY RIGHT NOW LET'S JUST TAKE THIS FIRST STEP. AT BEING ABLE TO GIVE THE D. A.'S. THE CREDIBILITY THAT THEY NEED TO MOVE FORWARD. AND SO WITH THAT TEACHER IS ASKING FOR AN AYE VOTE. CALDERON ON SB SEVEN TEN BY SENATOR BRADFORD THE MOTION IS G. PASSED THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER HI GENSER ATTY LACKEY. LACKEY NO BARRICADE HAN LI LI HI CORK. QUICK NOT VOTING SANTIAGO THEY ARE TELL NO C. R. TURNOUT WICKS WICKS I. THE MESSAGE ON CALL EACH TO THANK YOU MORE. AND WHENEVER YOU'RE READY FOR A CARD SB. FIVE SIX SIX SEVEN- AGAIN THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN EMBERS- I'M HERE TO PRESENT SB FIVE SIX SEVEN A BILL THAT WILL IMPROVE THE STATE FELONY DETERMINATE SENTENCING PROCESS I'M ACCEPTING TO SUGGEST TO COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS ON PAGE FIVE OF THE KNOWLES'S IS- TO MAKE PENAL CODE SECTION. ELEVEN SEVENTY POINT ONE PERTAINING TO ENHANCEMENTS CONSISTENT WITH THE APPROACH IN MY BILL THAT SECTION WOULD OTHERWISE SUNSET ON JANUARY. ONE TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY TWENTY TWO IF THIS BILL IS NOT AMENDED. JUST A LITTLE BACKGROUND CURRENT LAW SPECIFIES THAT IF THE STATUTE SPECIFIES THREE POSSIBLE SINCE SINCE SHE TURNED FOUR FELONY OFFENSES LOW MEDIC MIDDLE OR HIGH WITH VARIATIONS OF TIME TO BE SERVED THE CHOICE APPROPRIATE. APPROPRIATE TERMS REST WITH THE DISCRETION OF THE COURT EXISTING LAW SUNSETS BEGAN ON JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY TWO. AND S. B. FIVE SIX SEVEN IS A GOOD REPLACEMENT IT MAKES THE SYNCING PROCESS A LITTLE BIT MORE FAIR- THIS BILL CREATES A PRESUMPTION OF SENTENCING A JUDGMENT. NOT TO EXCEED THE MIDDLE TERM UNLESS THERE'S AGGRAVATED. CIRCUMSTANCES THAT JUSTIFY- IMPOSITION OF A HIGHER TERMS. OF THIS BILL PROVIDES- THAT WHEN I HIGHER TERMISM PULLS THE FACTS SUPPORTING THOSE AGGRAVATION SO MUST BE STIPULATED. TO BY THE DEFENDANT OR SUBMITTED TO THE JURY AND PROVEN BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT OR FOUND BY THE COURT IN A BENCH TRIAL IN THAT INSTANCE WHERE THERE WAS NO JURY INVOLVED. SB FIVE SIX SEVEN ALLOWS THE PARTIES TO DISPUTE THE FACTS IN THE RECORD OR PRESENT ADDITIONAL FACTS THIS MEASURE PERMITS DEFENDANTS TO REQUEST I BY KATIE HEARING OF TRIAL CHARGES TO BE SEPARATE IT SEPARATED FROM ENHANCEMENTS UNLESS THE FACTS AT ISSUE IS ALREADY A ELEMENT OF THE CHARGE OF THE FENCE. IN CONTEXT OVER CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM WHILE IT IS APPROPRIATE TO PUNISH PEOPLE FOR COMMITTING CRIMES WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GIVE IMPACTED PEOPLE PROPER DUE PROCESS THAT IS BUILT ON FAIRNESS AND FAX. S. B. A FIVE SIX DOES JUST THAT FINALLY LONG SINCE THE SINCE COSTS THE STATE LOTS OF MONEY AND ARE COUNTERPRODUCTIVE TO REHABILITATING PEOPLE AND BRING THEM BACK. TO THE FOLD AND TO SOCIETY WE NEED TO REVERSE THIS PRACTICE OF A FEEL OF WHAT I SHOULD SAY OF A FILL PRACTICE. I HAVE ONE WHEN THIS- HERE TODAY- STE STEPHEN- MUNCUL. THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CRIMINAL ATTORNEYS FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE MISTER MOM KILLED HAS SPENT FORTY THREE YEARS OF EXPERIENCE AS AN ATTORNEY AND HAS A CERTIFIED. IS A CERTIFIED SPECIALIST IN CRIMINAL LAW AFTER STEP TESTIMONY WILL- STAY ONLINE TO ASSIST US IF THERE'S ANY TELESCOPE TECHNICAL QUESTIONS AND MEMBERS ARE RESPECT US FOR ABOUT. THANK YOU CENTER BRADFORD. I WOULD GREATLY APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY. STEPHEN MONK HELP FROM. THESE OTHER GERMAN. YEAH THAT'S FINE STATE RUN CAL EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CJ AND SPONSOR THIS BILL. ANY FACTS USED TO INCREASE THE SENTENCE ABOVE THE STATUTORY MAXIMUM MUST BE PROVEN BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT AT TRIAL OR ADMITTED BY THE SENATE. THAT WAS THE HOLDING YOUR CUNNINGHAM VERSUS CALIFORNIA TWO THOUSAND SEVEN. IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT THIS LEGISLATURE RESPONDED TO THE DECISION BY ATTEMPTING TO FINESSE THE IDEA OF QUOTE STATUTORY MAXIMUMS SAYING RECORD WAS FREE TO CHOOSE ANY OF THREE AVAILABLE TERMS. BUT THERE'S CURRENTLY NO REQUIREMENT FOR PROOF OF AGGRAVATING FACTS AS THE SUPREME COURT REQUIRED AND FOR THAT REASON SHE SHE J. HAS ALWAYS BELIEVED THAT THE PRESENT. SYSTEM IS STILL UNCONSTITUTIONAL. SB FIVE SIXTY SEVEN IS THE FIX TO THIS CONSTITUTIONAL. BY AMENDING PENAL CODE SECTION ELEVEN SEVENTY SUBDIVISION B. IT REQUIRES PROOF OF AGGRAVATING FACTS AT TRIAL OR ADMISSION BY THE DEFENDANT. IT ALSO REQUIRES THAT THE TRIAL OF THOSE FAXED YOU SEPARATED OR BIFURCATED HUNDRED GUILT TRIAL IF THE DEFENDANT REQUESTS. THIS IS TO AVOID PREJUDICE FROM FACTORS NOT RELATED TO THE PREFER CAL. THESE NEWARK. ONLY APPLY IF THE PROSECUTION IS SEEKING AN AGGRAVATED TERMS. FIFTY EIGHT THANKS OR LOWER TERM WILL BE ADEQUATE PUNISHMENT THESE NEW REQUIREMENTS DON'T COME INTO PLAY. THE PROSECUTOR CAN EVEN PRESENT AGGRAVATING FACTS AT SENTENCING TO SUPPORT AN ARGUMENT FOR THE MIDDLE TERMS. WITHOUT DOING THE PLEADING IMPROVES OUR REQUIREMENTS JUST AS THEY HAVE ALWAYS DONE IN THE PAST. IGNORE THE DA IS SEEKING A MAXIMUM SENTENCE INVEST 3% OF FELONY CASES THAT ACTUALLY GO TO TRIAL. NOT ALL OF THEM WILL INVOLVE A BIFURCATED TRIAL. DIFFERENT AGGRAVATING FACTORS WILL BE PROVEN AS PART OF THE EVIDENCE OF JAIL THERE'S NO BIFURCATION. IF THE DEFENSE DOES NOT REQUESTED THERE'S NO BY FISH. AND EVEN WHERE THERE IS A REQUEST TO BIFURCATE EXPERIENCE WITH THE BIFURCATION OF PRIOR CONVICTIONS AT TRIAL SUGGESTED IN MOST CASES AFTER THE JURY FIND SKILLED. IN THE SENATE WILL EITHER ADMIT THE AGGRAVATING TRACKS OR WEAVE JURY SO THE COURT ALONG WILL DECIDE ON THE CRUCIBLES FAX. I UNDERSTAND THERE'S AN AMENDMENT TO THE VERSION BEFORE TODAY. WHICH MADE ACCEPTED AND WE'RE ALSO MADE CHANGES TO CANNOT. ALONG BALANCE POINT ONE REGARDING CHARGING- THIS- PROPOSED AMENDMENT WOULD REMOVE A SUNSET PROVISION.

WE HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENT THANK YOU AT THIS TIME. JERRY COULD NOT GO TO OPPOSITION WITNESSES LARRY MORSE CODE FOR DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION. UP BY PHONE. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS LARRY MORSE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION IN RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION TO SENATE BILL FIVE SIX SEVEN I WOULD NOTE THAT WE HAVE NOT HAD A CHANCE TO REVIEW THE AMENDMENT YET- THIS BILL AMENDS. CODE SECTION ELEVEN SEVENTY SUBDIVISION BE TOO SO THAT A TRIAL COURT MAY ONLY IMPOSE A SENTENCE AN AGGRAVATION IF THE CIRCUMSTANCES AN AGGRAVATION HAVE BEEN PROVEN BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT IF ADOPTED THIS WOULD REQUIRE THE PEOPLE TO THINK OF EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE AND THAT AGGRAVATION AND PLEAD THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN ADVANCE OF TRIAL. SB FIVE SIX SEVEN UNDERMINES THE LEGISLATURE SENSIBLE RESPONSE TO CUNNINGHAM VERSUS CALIFORNIA IN WHICH THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT HELD THAT CALIFORNIA'S DETERMINATE SENTENCING SCHEME AS IT STOOD WAS NOT ACTUALLY ADVISORY A JUDGE WAS REQUIRED TO IMPOSE THE MIDDLE TERM UNLESS IT BOUNCE BACKS IN AGGRAVATION RENDERING THE MIDDLE TERM THE TRUTH STATUTORY MAXIMUM. ANY FACTS AN AGGRAVATION BUS HAD TO BE PROVEN BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT TO A JURY THREE MONTHS AFTER THE DECISION AND CUNNINGHAM IN MARCH OF TWO THOUSAND SEVEN THE LEGISLATURE PASSED SENATE BILL FORTY THE SO CALLED CUNNINGHAM SIX WHICH AMENDED PENAL CODE SECTION ELEVEN SEVENTY SO THE TRIAL COURTS WERE EMPOWERED TO CONSIDER THE ENTIRETY OF THE EVIDENCE. AND IMPOSE THE MITGATED MIDDLE OR AGGRAVATED TERM AS APPROPRIATE THE LEGISLATURE DUST HELP THE COURTS AND JURORS FROM BEING OVERWHELMED BY LONG COSTLY TRIALS WHERE THE PEOPLE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PROVE BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT HOLISTIC FACTORS IN AGGRAVATION SUCH AS THE DEGREE OF PLANNING OR SOPHISTICATION OF A CRIME. WHETHER THE CRIME CONSTITUTED A HATE CRIME WHETHER THE DEFENDANT TOOK ADVANTAGE OF A POSITION OF TRUST OR A VULNERABLE VICTIM AND THE LEVEL OF VIOLENCE THE DEFENDANT. USED IN THE COMMISSION OF A CRIME SUCH TRACTORS AND SUGAR LESS. OFFENDERS GET SH SAY. AND CULPABLE OFFENDER GET SO. SB FIVE SIX SEVEN REQUIRE A BIFURCATED TRIAL ON THESE AGGRAVATING FACTORS- I'M LAST THE AGGRAVATING FACTORS AND ELEMENTS OF THE CRIME. WHAT ABOUT THE FACTORS THAT ARE NOT AN ELEMENT OF THE CRIME BUT ARE STILL AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE CHARGES SUCH AS THE VULNERABILITY OF THE VICTIM VICIOUSNESS CRUELTY AT CETERA. THESE KINDS OF AGGRAVATING FACTORS WOULD MOST LIKELY BE A PART OF THE PROSECUTION'S CASE IN CHIEF ANYWAY IT MAKES NO SENSE FROM AN EFFICIENCY OR COURT COSTS STANDPOINT BUT NOT HAVE THE JURY MAKES THESE FINDINGS AT THE SAME TIME THEY ARE DECIDING GUILT ON THE CRIME CHARGE. WE WOULD HOPE THAT CENTER FOR BRADFORD WOULD CONSIDER AMENDING THIS BILL SO THAT IF AN AGGRAVATING FACTOR IS NOT AN ELEMENT OF THE OFFENSE WHAT WOULD NECESSARILY BE PART OF THE PROSECUTION'S EVIDENCE IT WOULD NOT HAVE TO BE BIFURCATED. ALSO DEEP CONCERNS THAT SB FIVE SIX SEVEN SEVERELY RESTRICTS OF VICTIMS PARTICIPATION IN THE SENTENCING PROCESS FACTORS THAT THE VICTIM WALKED THE COURT TO CONSIDER AN AGGRAVATION COULD NOT BE CONSIDERED. UNLESS THEY WERE PLAYED IN ADVANCE OF JURY TRIAL AND PROVEN BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT THIS WOULD BE PARTICULARLY UNFAIR IN CASES WHERE EVIDENCE WAS EXPRESSLY EXCLUDED AS A RELEVANT OR INFLAMMATORY. AS WE SAW WITH THE HIGHLY PUBLICIZED BROCK TURNER CASE A FEW YEARS AGO THE SEXUAL ASSAULT VICTIM STATEMENT AT SENTENCING WAS POWERFUL. AND IMPACTFUL. SUCH TESTS TO. SHOULD NEVER BE. BECAUSE OF THESE CONCERNS THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION IS RESPECTFULLY ASKING FOR A NO VOTE. THANKS ARE.

ALLEGATIONS THAT WERE MADE TO HAVING AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE DEFENDANT TO. TESTIFY IN A BIFURCATED- SITUATION AGAINST THOSE CHARGES ONLY CREATES A AGAIN GREATER TRANSPARENCY AND FAIRNESS AND AS WE'VE SEEN- THIS MASS INCARCERATION IS ONLY IMPACTED POOR PEOPLE AND PEOPLE OF COLOR IN THIS JUST ALLOWS US TO LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD SO TO SPEAK AND RESPECT LESS RAGO. JACKSON THANK YOU MISTER BRADFORD FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD TOM THIS IS JUST ANOTHER. PILLAR IN OUR ABILITY TO CORRECT A LOT INJUSTICES IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. INSULA CHEERS RECKON I VOTE MEANT JERRY YOU MAKE CALDERON.

CRIMINAL RECORDS RELIEF. OKAY WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS- SB SEVEN THIRTY ONE WILL EXPAND CALIFORNIA'S EXISTING SYSTEM FOR ARREST AND CONVICTION RECORD RELIEF IN THREE WAYS. WHEN IT COMES TO- UP EXTENDED AUTOMATIC ARREST RECORD SEALING TO FELONIES IF THE INDIVIDUAL WAS NEITHER CHARGED NOR CONVICTED SIX YEARS AFTER THE ARREST. IT WOULD EXTEND- AUTOMATIC CONVICTION RECORD RELIEF TO NON SERIOUS AND NON VIOLENT FELONIES. AFTER AN INDIVIDUAL COMPLETES ALL TERMS OF INCARCERATION PROBATION. SUPERVISION POST RELEASE SUPERVISION PAROLE AND A FURTHER PERIOD OF FOUR YEARS WITHOUT ANYNEW CONVICTIONS. AND IT ALLOWS INDIVIDUALS CONVICTED OF A FELONY TO PETITION. IT WOULD BE BY PETITION THE COURT FOR SEAT SEEK THE CEILING BELIEF. THESE PETITIONS ARE DONE ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS AND THE COURTS MAKE THE FINAL DECISION. THERE EIGHT MILLION PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA LIVING WITH AN ARRESTER CONVICTION ON THEIR RECORD THE ARE PARENTS NEIGHBORS CO WORKERS FELLOW CHURCH GOERS. AT ONE INDIVIDUAL COMPLETES THEIR SENTENCE. THERE DEEMED TO HAVE PAID THEIR DEBT TO SOCIETY THEY'VE ACCEPTED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR ACTIONS. WHILE THEY WERE INCARCERATED WE HAVE MANY PROGRAMS WHICH THEY TAKE CLASSES THERE EARNED DEGREES IN ROLLING COUNSELING. THE PURSUE THE REHABILITATION THEY WORK HARD TO BE PREPARED FOR THEIR RE ENTRY. BUT AFTER RELEASE. INSTEAD OF BEING ABLE TO APPLY THEIR NEW SKILLS TO USE. AND BEGIN TO BUILD A NEW LIFE THEY'RE HIT WITH LITERALLY THOUSANDS OF RESTRICTIONS AND LIMITATIONS. ON REBUILDING THEIR LIFE- AN INDIVIDUAL'S CONVICTION RECORD STAYS ON. UNTIL THEY REACH OF IT A HUNDRED YEARS OF AGE. AND AS MANY AS THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS HAVE BEEN DENIED EMPLOYMENT BECAUSE OF PAST RECORDS A LOAN. THIS WILL NOT GIVE UP WILL GIVE INDIVIDUALS THE MEANS TO OVERCOME- US CIVIC EXCLUSIONS THAT A PAST RECORD BRINGS. THIS DOES NOT CHANGE HOW EXPLAINED CHEN EXPUNGEMENT RELIEF INTERACTS WITH OCCUPATIONAL LICENSING. IT DOES NOT MAKE ANY CHANGES TO EXISTING LICENSING DISCLOSURE OBLIGATIONS- HIGH SENSITIVITY LICENSING AGENCIES AND EMPLOYERS WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE FULL ACCESS TO ALL RECORDS. EVEN THOSE GRANTED RELIEF INCLUDING LAW ENFORCEMENT. HUMAN SERVICES INVOLVING CHILDREN. OF THE CARE OF CHILDREN THE ELDERLY BANKING AND COMMISSION ON TEACHER CREDENTIALING AND HIGH SENSITIVITY EMPLOYERS THAT RELY ON THE- J. LIVE SCAN FINGERPRINT BACKGROUND WILL ALSO CONTINUE TO HAVE. ALL FULL ACCESS- SB SEVEN THIRTY ONE INCLUDES STRINGENT OVERSIGHT AND STRICT SCRUTINY AT EVERY SINGLE STAGE- IT PROVIDES AMPLE OPPORTUNITY FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT TO WEIGH IN ON ANY POTENTIAL RELIEF GRANTED.

ACCORDING TO A REPORT A RECENT REPORT BY CSJ START TWO POINT FIVE MILLION WORKING AGE CALIFORNIANS SALAS ONE IN TEN LIVING WITH A FELONY RECORD CALIFORNIA MAINTAINS AN INDIVIDUAL'S CONVICTION RECORD UNTIL THAT PERSON REACHES A HUNDRED YEARS OF AGE BECAUSE OF THE WIDESPREAD USAGE OF BACK BACKGROUND CHECKS IN TODAY'S SOCIETY. THESE RECORDS PERMANENT PRESENT THOUSAND THE BARRIERS RESULTING IN WIDESPREAD CONSTRAINTS ON COMMUNITY REINTEGRATION AND ECONOMIC GROWTH THE REPORT ALSO FOUND THAT THE STATE'S GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT LOS TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS DUE TO THE BARRIER A PAST FELONY RECORD REPRESENTS FOR PEOPLE TO BE FULLY EMPLOYED.

I DID NOT RESULT IN PRISON OR JAIL TERMS SO INDIVIDUALS SUCH AS I CURRENTLY HAVE NO WAY TO RUN. REGARDLESS OF HOW YOU CHOSEN TO LIVE OUR LIVES. IT SHOULD THEN COME TO NO SURPRISE THAT 86% OF A. R. C. NUMBERS I'VE NEVER HAD A RECORD EXPUNGED AND MAJORITY EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT. HAVE BEEN DENIED WORK BECAUSE OF THEIR PRIOR CONVICTION HISTORY. BLOCKING ACCESS TO EMPLOYMENT HOUSING ARE PRIMARY FACTORS DRIVING RECIDIVISM. AND CONVICTION RECORDS ARE SEVERE BARRIERS TO SUCCESSFUL REENTRY AND AGAIN COME AT THE COST OF TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY TO CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY. AS CONTINUES OPEN UP AND BUSINESSES FACE WORK SHORTAGES WE SHOULD SUPPORT SMART AND RESTORATIVE WAYS TO ALLOW INDIVIDUALS OPPORTUNITIES TO WORK AND FIND SECURE AND STABLE HELPING.

THERE'S MORE NOTICE ALL COMMENTS THANK YOU AT THIS TIME OKAY THANK YOU NOW. WE HAVE IN OPPOSITION OF FRANCIE KOHLER CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION LICENSE INVESTIGATORS WHO SPEAK IN PERSON THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE WHENEVER YOU'RE READY TO BEGIN THANK YOU CHAIR. MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE MY NAME IS FRANCIE KAHLER I'M A PAST PRESIDENT AND CURRENT SHARE THE GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS COMMITTEE FOR THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF LICENSED INVESTIGATORS I REPRESENT OVER ELEVEN HUNDRED MEMBERS AND THEIR FAMILIES I'M ALSO. A CRIMINAL DEFENSE INVESTIGATOR AND HAVE BEEN FOR OVER THIRTY SIX YEARS. WE APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR HAS AMEND. AMENDED SB SEVEN THIRTY ONE TO INCLUDE VIOLENT AND- SERIOUS FELONIES AND TO PRESERVE ACCESS FOR FOUR YEARS RATHER THAN THE TWO YEARS THAT WAS ORIGINALLY PROPOSED. HOWEVER THE MEASURE STILL AUTOMATICALLY CLOSE RECORDS. INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE BEEN CONVICTED AND SUBSEQUENT COMPLETELY THEIR SENTENCES IN ANY PAROLE OR PROBATION VIOLATIONS ARE PART OF OUR- OUR SOCIETY. WE SUPPORT A PROCESS TO ENABLE PEOPLE TO HAVE A SECOND CHANCE. PARTICULARLY WHEN IT INVOLVES EMPLOYMENT IN HOUSING IT'S CRITICAL. THERE ARE HOWEVER MANY SITUATIONS. WHEN A CRIMINAL CONVICTION IS THAT A VITAL IMPORTANCE TO THE PROTECTION OF OUR MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY. SUCH AS EVALUATING STAKEHOLDERS IN MERGERS. ACQUISITIONS AND BUSINESS PARTNERSHIPS. VALUE IN AN INDIVIDUAL EITHER AS A ROOMMATE OR IN A ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIP. CRENNEL CUSTODY AND- PARENTAL SKEWS ME CUSTODY IN DIVORCE CASES. EDIBILITY IN CIVIL LAWSUITS SUCH AS THE RIGHT TO CONFRONT WITNESSES WITH IMPEACHMENT INFORMATION. IN THE INTEREST OF AN EQUITABLE JUSTICE SYSTEM THIS INFORMATION MUST ALSO BE AVAILABLE TO BOTH SIDES IN A CIVIL PROCEEDING. EVALUATED APPLICANTS BEEN CONVICTED OF FINANCIAL FRAUD FOR EXAMPLE THAT'S APPLYING FOR FINANCIAL POSITION IN A CARE GIVING SITUATION SUCH AS A NURSING HOME AND PUTTING THE PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES AT WORTH. AND I SEE THAT. THOSE THAT ARE CONSIDERED FOR ELECTED POSITION OUR POLITICAL APPOINTEE- DO HAVE TO SELF DISCLOSE IF THEY HAVE A CONVICTION BUT THAT'S ONLY A SELF DISCLOSURE AND NO WAY TO VERIFY. FINALLY SB SEVEN THIRTY ONE WHAT FOR ME THAT PROHIBIT MANY BUSINESSES FROM COMPLYING WITH EXISTING LAWS THAT INCLUDE SPECIFIC LOOK BACK PERIODS AND SET FOR THE MANDATORY SCOPE OF SCREENING. INSTEAD OF THE BRIDE AND COMPLETE CLOSURE OF CRIMINAL RECORDS AN ALTERNATIVE WOULD BE TO RESTRUCTURE ITS PROVISIONS SO THAT THE SAME CRITERIA APPLE COAL TO EMPLOYMENT. THAT CURLY ALLOWS ONLY SEVEN YEARS AND NOW IN THE BILL IS FOUR YEARS WOULD ACTUALLY APPLY TO HOUSING AS WELL. THE SAME RULES THAT APPLY TO EMPLOYMENT WOULD APPLY TO HOUSING WHERE THE APPLICANT OF WHERE THE RECEIVER OF THE APPLICANT COULD ONLY LOOK BACK FOR A PERIOD OF TIME AND NO MORE INSTEAD OF THE CLOSER RECORDS AND FOR THESE REASONS SB SEVEN THIRTY ONE. ACCORDING TO OUR VIEW DOES NOT STRIKE AN APPROPRIATE BALANCE BETWEEN THE ABILITY OF CONVICTED INDIVIDUALS TO BUILD A NEW LIFE. AND THE PROTECTION OF THE PUBLIC I URGE A NO VOTE IN THE COMMITTEE UNLESS IT'S AMENDED THANK YOU. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY.

SB THREE FIFTY WHICH I THINK IS A VERY IMPORTANT PUBLIC SAFETY. BILL SENATE BILL THREE FIFTY EIGHT MODERNIZES THEDEFINITION OF MAIL. AND PROTECTS ALL FORMS OF MAIL THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE DELIVERIES PROCESS. CURRENTLY THE DEFINITION OF MALE ONLY PROTECTS U. S. P. S. UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE MAIL. AND THIS DEFINITION IS OVER SEVENTY YEARS OLD. AND IS SIMPLY OUTDATED. TODAY WE HAVE MANY MALE CARE OPTIONS MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF MALE RANGING FROM POSTCARDS. TO LARGE ENVELOPES TO PACKAGES. ALL THESE SHOULD BE AWARDED THE SAME THEFT PROTECTION AS USPS MAIL. BECAUSE OF THE CURRENT COVET NINETEEN SITUATION ONLINE SALES HAVE INCREASED EXPONENTIALLY IN FACT BETWEEN MARCH TWENTY TWENTY. IN APRIL THIS YEAR ONLINE SALES HAS INCREASED FORTY NINE PERCENT. IN OUR COUNTRY. WHILE SHOPPING ONLINE CAN BE EASIER AND SAFER UNFORTUNATELY THIEVES WITH MALA TENSION ARE INCREASINGLY STEALING PACKAGES HE SEES ARE OFTEN RE REFER TO AS PORCH PIRATES. I JUST A PORTION AMOUNT OF PORCH PIRACY OCCURS IN CALIFORNIA IN 20001930% OF ALL STOLEN PACKAGES ACROSS THE NATION WERE STOLEN IN THIS STATE. I'LL SAY THAT AGAIN 30% OF ALL STOLEN PACKAGES AND UNITED STATES OF AMERICA WERE STOLEN IN CALIFORNIA. THESE PACKAGES CAN CONTAIN A WIDE VARIETY OF HIS INITIAL ITEMS SUCH AS MEDICATIONS AND FOOD. MANY SENIORS AND DISABLED INDIVIDUALS IN YOUR DISTRICT AND MY DISTRICT RELY ON THESE PACKAGES EVERY DAY FOR DELIVERY FOR THEIR FOR THEIR DAILY SURVIVAL. NOW TO PROTECT THOSE MOST VULNERABLE WE MUST TAKE EVERY STEP TO STOP THIS PACKAGE THEFT. THIS UPDATED DEFINITION OF MAIL WILL COMBAT PORCH PIRACY BY PROTECTING ALL TYPES OF MAIL INCLUDING PACKAGES FROM ALL TYPES OF MAIL CARRIERS. SB THREE FIFTY EIGHT SIMPLY BRINGS PARITY BETWEEN U. S. P. S. AND NON U. S. P. S. MAIL THEFT. NOTE THAT MISTER CHAIR THAT CONCLUDES MY OPENING I DO BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE SOME WITNESSES THAT SHOULD BE STANDING BY.

WITH MORE PEOPLE SHOPPING ONLINE MORE GOOD TO BE DELIVERED TO PEOPLE'S HOMES BY MEANS OTHER THAN THE TRADITIONAL POSTAL SERVICE WELL THIS BRINGS CONVENIENCE THAT IS ALSO MADE PACKAGES AND INVITING AND EASY TARGET RECEPTORS THROUGHOUT THE DELIVERY PROCESS. AS CONSUMERS WE OFTEN DON'T KNOW WHERE OUR PACKAGES ARE COMING FROM- WHAT KERRIER IS DELIVERING THEM WE EXPECT THAT ALL OUR PACKAGES WILL BE PROTECTED THROUGHOUT THE DELIVERY PROCESS REGARDLESS OF THE CARRIER. THE LAW IS CURRENTLY WRITTEN IS NOT EQUALLY PROTECT DIFFERENT FORMS OF MALES AND IT CAN BECOME A LIFE OR DEATH MATTER VERY SPECIAL ITEMS FOR MEDICINE. BUT A PERSONAL NOTE ONE MINUTE CHECKS WERE STOLEN FROM MY FRONT PORCH I HAD TO CANCEL MY CHECKING ACCOUNT AND DEAL WITH THE AGGRAVATION OF CHANGING ACCOUNT INFORMATION ON ALL MY DIRECT PAID BILLS.

OKAY WE NOW GO TO- OPPOSITION- WE HAVE KATHY SURE ACLU BY PHONE AND DECLINED BACCHUS THE ELLA BAKER CENTER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS DRUG POLICY ALLIANCE ALLIANCE- BOTH BY PHONE- EIGHTEEN T. OPERATOR YOU CAN OPEN UP THE LINE. GOOD AFTERNOON- MISTER KAREN MEMBERS KATHY SURE FOR ACLU CALIFORNIA ACTIONS WE RESPECTFULLY NOT DEPOSED SB THREE FIFTY EIGHT. THIS BILL WOULD DOUBLE THE POTENTIAL JAIL TERM FOR THEFT OF LOW VALUE PACKAGES FOR SIX MONTHS UNDER CURRENT LAW TO YEAR ASPECTOS DEL. I HAVE BEEN THE VICTIM OF PACKAGED BACK SEVERAL TIMES I UNDERSTAND PEOPLE'S FRUSTRATION WITH THIS CRIME. THAT SAID WHEN SOMEONE COME BONTA MY COURTS AND FIELDS MY TWENTY FIVE DOLLAR BOX OF ORGANIC SACKS MY NEW IMMERSION BLENDER OR EVEN A NICE DOWN JACKET I GOT MY PARTNER FOR CHRISTMAS. IT IS NOT AN APPROPRIATE RESPONSE OR A JUST RESPONSE TO BLOCK THAT PERSON UP FOR A YEAR. THIS IS TRUE FOR SEVERAL REASONS. FIRST WE IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK TO REDUCE THE INCIDENCE OF PACKAGE THAT. MANY YEARS OF RESEARCH SHOW THAT AN INCREASE IN THE SEVERITY OF PUNISHMENT DOES NOTHING TO DETER FUTURE OFFENSES. IT'S GROWING MONEY AWAY SPENDING IT WITHOUT ANY BENEFIT TO PUBLIC SAFETY. SECOND IT DIRECTLY CONTRAVENES THE WILL OF CALIFORNIA VOTERS AND ENACTING PROP FORTY SEVEN. THE VOTERS UNDERSTOOD THAT SPENDING THE STATE'S MONEY ON LOCKING UP LOW LEVEL OFFENDERS FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME WITH WASTEFUL AND INEFFECTIVE AND THEY OPTED TO MOVE AWAY FROM THAT APPROACH. FINALLY WE KNOW THAT ANY INCREASE IN PUNISHMENT FOR THIS TYPE OF LOW LEVEL CRIME. IS GOING TO FALL DISPROPORTIONATELY ON BLACK PEOPLE AND OTHER PEOPLE OF COLOR. CALIFORNIA HAS TAKEN MEANINGFUL STEPS TO MOVE TOWARD LESS PUNITIVE MORE EFFECTIVE AND MORE HUMANE CRIMINAL JUSTICE POLICIES. WE KNOW WHAT WORKS TO PREVENT CRIME IF YOU WANT TO STOP PACKAGE BACK UP THE REAL EDUCATIONAL AND ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY AND MORE ABOUT SOCIAL SERVICES. TO ALL COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND PROVIDE EFFECTIVE PROGRAMMING AND SUPPORT THE REINTEGRATION FOR THOSE WHO ARE CONVICTED OF CRIMES. DON'T THROW THE STATE MONEY AWAY ON LONGER SENTENCES THAT DO MORE HARM THAN GOOD. WE RESPECTFULLY AFTER YOUR NOTE. THANK YOU. NOT GLENN BACKUS ELLA BIGGEST. AFTERNOON GOING BACK ISRAEL BIGGER SENSE FOR HUMAN IN WHICH WITH ON TO THIS. IF TO GET INFORMATION FROM AMAZON ABOUT THE AVERAGE PACKAGE VALUED IN TWENTY TWELVE IT WAS PUBLISHED THAT THEIR- AVERAGE VALUE WAS FORTY SEVEN DOLLARS AND THIRTY ONE CENTS. MY MOST RECENT AMAZON PURCHASES WERE A REFRIGERATOR MAGNET. NINE DOLLARS AND SEVENTY EIGHT CENTS IN VALUE AND BEFORE THAT I GOT A FOUR PACK OF SOCKS ALL BLACK FOR SIXTEEN DOLLARS AND TWENTY CENTS. IF THEY'VE BEEN STOLEN UNDER CURRENT CALIFORNIA LAW. AB SEVENTY SIX MONTHS IN JAIL I THOUSAND DOLLAR FINE. IT'S ALREADY TOO MUCH FOR THE PERSON. FOR THEIR FAMILY TO HAVE TO BEAR THE COSTS IN THAT CONVERSATION AND FOR THE CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS TO BEAR. INCREASES TO TWELVE NINETY TO DOUBLE DOWN ON BAD POLICY AND DISRESPECTFUL OF THE VOTERS WE HAVE THREE ON ABOUT THANK YOU. THANK YOU WE NOW BRING YOU BACK TO WITNESSES. JUST GIVE ME IN OPPOSITION IN THE ROOM. SEEING NONE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION ON OUR ON THE LAWN OUTSIDE. SEEING NONE. AND THEN WE'LL GO TO LINE- AT&amp;T OPERATOR FOR WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. OPPOSITION FOR SB THREE FIVE EIGHT PLEASE PRESS ONE THEN THERE WHAT THIS TIME. ROBERT LANE NINE SEVEN HUNDRED AND NINETY TO PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD AFTERNOON BARCODE GEORGIA MAY HELP THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU. THE ISSUE. WE HAVE NO ADDITIONAL COMMENT THANK YOU AT THIS TIME. OKAY DO NOT BRING IT BACK INTO COMMITTEE MEMBERS- SO MR SANTIAGO. I GREW UP IN MR LACKEY. THANK YOU SELECTED I'LL BE VERY VERY OF. VERY BRIEF I'D I WOULD FIRST OF ALL LIKE TO JUST SAY THAT. IT'S VERY UNLIKELY THAT THESE PEOPLE COMMIT THIS OFFENSE THAT YOU'RE ADDRESSING ONLY DO ONE RESIDENTS AT A TIME. WELL AT A TIME THEY ONLY DO IT BUT I MEAN THEY CONTINUALLY DO MULTIPLE RESIDENCES BECAUSE THERE REALLY IS NO. THREAT OF ARREST OR ANY THREAT OF SIGNIFICANT CONSEQUENCES SECONDLY. IT WAS JUST A. NOT THAT LONG AGO TWENTY NINETEEN WHERE WE HAD ASSEMBLY MEMBER LOW WITH THE AB TWELVE TEN. IN A BILL WAS VERY SIMILAR TO THIS THE PAST SIX OO. BY THIS COMMITTEE AND THIS PROBLEM HAS DONE NOTHING BUT GOT WORSE. SINCE THAT ACTUALLY OCCURRED SO I'M THANKFUL YOU'RE BRINGING THIS TO OUR ATTENTION AND IT PROBABLY HAS MY SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER. MR SANTIAGO. I THINK MR CANNOT A COUPLE QUESTIONS BECAUSE I'VE HEARD A LOT OF DEBATE IN THE UNITED- TALKED ABOUT A LITTLE BEEN TRYING TO GET CLARITY. AND HERE'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO GET TO SO THERE'S THERE IS- OF COURSE THE PEOPLE SAYING THAT THIS IS GOING TO INCREASE PENALTIES AND CRIMES THE WAY I UNDERSTOOD WHEN I LOOKED AT I WANNA BE CRYSTAL CLEAR THAT I'M UNDERSTANDING YOU CORRECTLY. IS YOUR BURNT YOUR BRING IN PARITY. TO THAT SORT OF DELIVERY SYSTEM OF GOODS WHATEVER COMPANY IT MAY BE. TO WHAT THE POST OFFICE CURRENTLY DOES BUT I WANNA BE CRYSTAL CLEAR THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS TRYING TO DO. ABSOLUTELY I THINK MISTER SAN DIEGO SOME OF THE CONFUSION ON THAT IS- BASED ON PREVIOUS CONVERSATIONS. ON MISTER LOWE'S BILL. A FROM A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO MY ORIGINAL- RENDITION OF THIS BILL LAST YEAR- INCLUDED- AND FOR EXAMPLE IN MY BILL INCLUDED. YOU KNOW INTENT TO STEAL INCLUDED- ENTERING THE CARTILAGE CURTILAGE OF THE HOME. AND SO THERE WAS A LOT OF OTHER DETAILS IN IN THAT BILL THAT- AS AND IS NOT IN THIS BILL NOW. AND IN FACT THE VERY LANGUAGE OF THE BILL IS VERY CLEAR AND THEN IT'S JUST A FEW COUPLE WORDS CHANGES THAT IT'S MAKING. THEIR MODERN DELIVERY SYSTEM- OF OTHER COMPANIES. RIGHT I MEAN WE'RE JUST EQUALIZING EVERYTHING TO THE UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE IN FACT. THIS LANGUAGE WAS- WORKED OUT BETWEEN MY OFFICE. AND SENATE PUBLIC SAFETY TO COME TO A I THINK A BETTER BILL AND I AND I'M- MORE. A CLEANER BILL AND THEN EASIER TO- OPERATE UNDER THIS LAW THAN WHAT I WAS ORIGINALLY INTENDING. SO YES THAT THAT THAT IS TO ANSWER QUESTION DIRECTLY YES IS DOING EXACTLY THAT PUTTING PARITY INTO THIS. COAT MESSAGES I STARTED VOICE MAN. MISTER ROGER BUT BUT WHEN PAIRED IT WILL WORK MAN YES PLEASE THAT IS SO MISTER MISTER WITH QUESTION I'D LIKE TO CONTINUE TO ASK IF I WANT YOU TO ADDRESS MAYBE WHY WE'RE HEARING- THE OPPOSITE BECAUSE- IN AND OUT BECAUSE OF THE I MEAN THE ARGUMENT ABOUT- THE ARGUMENT ABOUT INCREASING FEES AND PENALTIES AND SUPPORT. DOES NOT SIT WELL WITH ME WHEN IT COMES TO. A SERVICE TO A TO THIS PARTICULAR- ITEM BUT- WHY THEN WOULD SOMEBODY MAKE THAT ARGUMENT WELL I THINK BASED ON THE- CURRENTLY- YOU KNOW FOR LACK OF FED EX YOU YOU PS- AND THE OTHER DELIVER COMPANIES AREN'T COVERED. UNDER THIS CODE AND SO THERE'S SOME DEBATE ON. ON YOU KNOW HOW- POLICE AND PROSECUTORS NEED TO PROSECUTE THAT CRIME SO AGAIN THIS IS JUST. BRINGING THEM ALL UNDER THE SAME CODE MAKING PARITY ON EVERYTHING WE'RE NOT CREATING A NEW. CRIME WERE NOT. INCREASING THE PENALTIES FOR ANY CRIME THE CRIME AND THE PENALTIES ARE ALREADY IN CODE. WE'RE JUST MATCHING. ALL THE OTHER DELIVERY SYSTEMS TO. WHAT THE U. S. P. S. HAS AND AGAIN IT GOES BACK TO THOSE PREVIOUS ITERATIONS OF THE BILL THE PREVIOUS CONVERSATIONS I BELIEVE BECAUSE SOME OF THAT CONFUSION. IF I HAVE ANYTHING I'LL COME BACK WITH THE SECOND COMING- IS ABOUT OKAY IS THERE FOR. YEAH OR I CAN ANSWER THE QUESTION SO THIS WOULD GIVE YOU PARITY WITH THE U. S. P. S. PENALTIES HOWEVER IT CAN ALSO RIGHT NOW TODAY IF YOU STEAL A PACKAGE IT'S ARE PROSECUTED UNDER JUST COMMON THEFT. AND THE PENALTY THERE IS SIX UP TO SIX MONTHS RATHERTHAN A YEAR EITHER WAY IT'S A MISDEMEANOR THIS ONE ALLOWS IT FOR UP TO A YEAR- UNDER PROP FORTY SEVEN ALL OF THOSE CRIMES WERE. CHECK WELL THE PENALTIES WERE CHANGED AND YOU DON'T GET MORE THAN SIX MONTHS UNLESS YOU STEAL SOMETHING OVER NINE HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS SO WITH ISN'T INCREASE OVER WHAT THE CURRENT PROSECUTION WOULD BE BUT IT JUST BRINGS IT IN LINE WITH THE U. S. POST OFFICE- I'VE GONE BACK AND FORTH ON THIS BILL I AM GOING TO VOTE FOR TO DAY- AND- BECAUSE YOU DID. CHANGE SO MUCH AND NOW SENATE PUBLIC SAFETY I THINK- RESPECTING THAT CHAIR SEVEN PUBLIC SAFETY I WILL VOTE YESTERDAY AND I GUESS I'D BETTER MOVE THE BILL. ALL RIGHT YES PLEASE. OKAY THANK YOU MR VICE CHAIR AND I JUST I WANTED TO BUILD ON THE CONVERSATION THAT'S HAPPENED SO FAR AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED THE LEGISLATURE DETERMINED THAT MAIL THEFT ALERT. SERVED TWELVE MONTHS- NOW MAIL IS DELIVERED I MEAN EVEN FROM WHEN I WAS A CHILD I THE VAST MAJORITY OF MAIL WAS DELIVERED BY THE US POSTAL SERVICE THAT'S NO LONGER TRUE THE VAST MAJORITY OF MY PACKAGES ARE NOT DELIVERED BY PRIVATE CARRIER. SO IF. AFTER THE PACKAGE WAS ENVISIONED TO BE TWELVE YEAR TWELVE MONTHS USING TWELVE MONTHS AND THAT SHOULD BE TRUE NO MATTER WHO IS DELIVERING THE PACKAGE IF THE CONVERSATION IS WHETHER OR NOT THAT IS AN APPROPRIATE AMOUNT OF TIME TO ME THAT IS A SEPARATE CONVERSATION. AND ONE OF THIS LEGISLATURE CAN TAKE UP AND- AND THEN WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS BUT THE QUESTION BEFORE US TODAY IS SHOULD IT MATTER WHO DELIVERS YOUR PACKAGE AND MAIL THEFT IS. HAPPENING ALL THE TIME TO MY CONSTITUENTS AS I'M SURE IS TRUE OF MANY OF US AND IF TWELVE MONTHS IS APPROPRIATION MATTER OF AMAZON IS YOUR DELIVER A OR THE POST OFFICE AND SO I AM LOOKING FOR AND SUPPORTING THIS TODAY. THANK YOU THANK YOU. WITH A- THANK YOU VERY ROBUST CONVERSATION FOR THIS BILL- AND I KNOW YOU AND I'VE SPOKEN ABOUT THIS BEFORE SO I JUST HAVE TWO THINGS ONE SO I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE ANDERSON IS VERY CLEARLY THAT IF YOU'LL GET MAIL DELIVERED THROUGH A PRIVATE KERRIER AMAZON UPS. FEDEX WHATEVER- IF THAT PACKAGES IS STOLEN UNDER YOUR BILL THEY WOULD THEN ADD THAT THE POTENTIAL SENTENCING WOULD BE AT PARITY WITH CURRENT UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE PENALTIES WHICH IS UP TO ONE YEAR WHAT YES AND WE'RE NOT CHANGING ANY SORT OF CURRENT US PS PENALTIES AS WRITING THE SAME. OKAY THANK YOU FOR THAT- I FORGOT MY SECOND QUESTION I'M SORRY. WHAT IT WAS JUST BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ONCE THE BILL PASSES. THANK YOU- SO YOU KNOW WHAT THIS REALLY BOILS DOWN TO IS. WHAT THEY HAVE SAID YOU KNOW THIS ABOUT MAIL AND AT THE EXPANSION OF OUR MAIL SYSTEM HAS SIX. I MEAN THEY DELIVER PACKAGES THAT ARE SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS TO YOUR FRONT PORCH. AND IF YOU'RE NOT THERE TO TAKE ON BEFORE THE PERSON COMING DOWN THE ROAD TO SEIZE IT THERE TAKES IT- THAT'S A SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS DOWN NOT TO FORTY SEVEN DOLLARS STAFF- SO THAT THAT'S TO ME THAT'S KIND OF BESIDE THE POINT. THE POINT IS PEOPLE ARE SICK AND TIRED OF HAVING YOUR STUFF STOLEN OFF THE FRONT PORCH BY THESE PART B. PORCH PIRATES. AND AND SO THAT THE ANSWER TO THAT IS TO DO EXACTLY WHAT THIS BILL IS DOING IS MAKING SURE THAT THOSE PORCH PIRATES KNOW WHAT THEY'RE GETTING INTO WHICH IS THE SAME AS IF YOU'RE BREAKING IN OUR MAILBOXES WHICH THEY DO A LOT OF. AND AND YOU GET TO PAY A PRICE FOR THAT YOU GET TO PAY A PENALTY. AND THAT'S WHAT THIS IS AND YOU KNOW WHETHER THE PENALTIES TO STEP OR NOT THAT'S LIKE. MISS BAR CANCER IS FOR ANOTHER OTHER DAY BUT I THINK IT'S A GREAT BILL AND I THINK THAT THE PUBLIC WOULD BE AS WELL RECEIVED FROM THE PUBLIC WHO ARE SICK AND TIRED OF BEING RIPPED OFF. AND AND IT'S A GREAT RESPONSE TO THAT. AND SO ARE YOU TAKING AMENDMENTS ON THE BILL BECAUSE IF YOU ARE LOVED WE HAD AND- IF WE ENCOUNTER I WOULD HAVE. YES I'D BE HAPPY TO ADD YOU AS A CO AUTHOR ANYBODY ELSE I DON'T WE DON'T HAVE ANY MEMBERS PLAN AT THIS POINT TIME BECAUSE IT'S- THE BILL'S BEEN PRETTY I DIDN'T MEAN IT IS A PRETTY EFFICIENT BUILT ON. THERE SO I THINK I'M A CO AUTHOR NOT AMENDMENTS THOUGH YEAH I THANK YOU. I'D LIKE TO BE ADDED. THANK YOU. THIS WORKS SORRY I REMEMBER SECOND GRADE- ONE OF THE THINGS UNITED. BILL EARLIER WAS- WOULD SAY THAT THIS BILL IS NOT NOT. IT'S NOT. YOU TO. SO OF YOUR OF UP. OR ONE OFF IT'S MORE GEARED TOWARDS THE SORT OF PROFESSIONAL RINGS THAT- SOME PEOPLE BELIEVE ARE PERPETRATING THESE CRIMES. CAN YOU TELL ME EXACTLY HOW THIS BILL IS. GEARED TOWARDS THAT UNIVERSE OF PEOPLE WELL I THINK THAT- YOU KNOW THE CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE OBVIOUSLY HAS A GREAT BILL THAT'S- WORKING ITS WAY THAT'S- GOING AFTER. CRIME RINGS AND- THE ORGANIZED- PACKAGE THEFT. WHICH I. YOU KNOW THIS BILL I THINK SUPPLEMENTS THAT COMPLIMENTS IT DOESN'T GET IN ITS WAY DID DOESN'T- CHANGE IT AT ALL- A LOOK IN INDIFFERENCE. I UNDERSTAND THE OPPOSITION'S ARGUMENTS ON A TWENTY FIVE DOLLAR PACKAGE OR FORTY SEVEN DOLLAR PACKAGE THAT'S- THAT. WILL I DON'T THINK ANYBODY ENVISIONS WITH THIS BILL THAT THAT'S WHAT. WE'RE GOING TO PROSECUTE RIGHT AYE AYE BUT- THE SAME PEOPLE THAT ARE RECEIVING TWENTY FIVE DOLLAR PACKAGES AND FORTY SEVEN OUR PACKAGES ARE ALSO RECEIVING ESSENTIAL. SUPPLIES MEDICATIONS FOOD- YOU KNOW SINCE THE PANDEMIC STARTED A LOT MORE PEOPLE ARE ORDERING FOOD TO BE DELIVERED THAN EVER BEFORE. MEDICATIONS OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE COMING MEDICAL DEVICES MEDICAL SUPPLIES. HE IS WE GARDASIL THE VALUE OF THOSE PARTICULAR ITEMS THAT ARE LEFT ON THE PORCH. THEIR THEIR VALUES THEIR DOLLAR IT'S NOT THE DOLLAR VALUE THAT MATTERS IT'S- WHAT IT MEANS TO THAT PERSON WHO'S RECEIVING THAT PACKAGE OF ITS A MEDICAL DEVICE OR MEDICAL SUPPLIES IT DOES MATTER HOW MUCH IT COSTS. THEY NEED THAT SUPPLY TO SURVIVE. AND SO- THIS IS DESIGNED TO GO AFTER. FOLKS THAT ARE FOR YOU KNOW FOR LACK OF A BETTER TERM MAKING A LIVING. OUT OF FOLLOWING THE AMAZON TRUCK AND WHEN THEY GO AROUND THE CORNER- GOING ON TO THAT PERSON'S. FRONT YARD AND FRONT DOOR IN AND GRABBING THAT THAT- THAT BOX. OR PACKAGE OR WHATEVER SO- YEAH GOING TO WORK YEAH I THINK THE BEST WAY TO THINK ABOUT THIS IS IF SOMEBODY REALLY JUST ONCE STOLE A TWENTY FIVE DOLLAR. OR FIFTY OR A HUNDRED DOLLARS WORTH PACKAGE- THE DA ISN'T GONNA GO ALL HOG AND PUT THEM IN JAIL FOR A YEAR- YOU KNOW THEY'LL TRY AND GET THEM TO PLEAD TO. YOU NOW. PLEAD GUILTY CAN NOW PAY FIND THEY'RE NOT GONNA PUT HIM IN JAIL FOR THE REST ON THE OTHER HAND IF IT IS. SOMEBODY GOING AROUND AND PICKING UP ONE PACKAGE AFTER ANOTHER. THEN THEY MAY GO AFTER THEM AND THEY MIGHT PUT HIM IN JAIL FOR A YEAR AND I'M OKAY WITH THAT SO. I FINALLY TALKED MYSELF INTO YOUR BILL. TOPS YOU I YOU'VE YOU'VE ARGUED YOURSELF MUCH BETTER THAN I COULD HAVE. AND THE OTHER. PEOPLE WE ASK IF YOU. WE ARE TOGETHER YEAH RIGHT OF COURSE ISN'T MUCH. IT IS NOT THE BILL IN PARLIAMENT SECOND AND ON S. THREE FIFTEEN BY SENATOR JOHNS THE MOTION. SHARES RECORD. IS NOT.

IS ASHLEY AND MICHELLE MONTERROSA MEMBERS OF THE CRIME SURVIVORS FOR SAFETY AND JUSTICE AND JUSTICE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA MEMBERS AT THE CORRECT TIME I WILL RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THE BILL. TAKEN KDM PERSONAL SECOND THANK YOU SENATOR. AND ANTE OPERATOR IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING. I THINK WHAT MIGHT'VE. IN BETTER PERSON YEAH. I KNOW IT'S AN EXCITING DAY. THANK YOU SENATOR LEYVA FOR THE INTRODUCTION GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS MICHELLE MONTH IT'LL SUCK THE ELDEST SURVIVING SISTER OF SEAN MONTERROSA JOHN WHAT THAT ALSO WAS KILLED BY VALLEJO POLICE ON JUNE SECOND OF TWENTY TWENTY HE WAS KNEELING WHAT IS HANDS IN THE AIR IN A PARKING LOT ONE BELOW POLICE OFFICER JARED TIME FIRED FIVE SHOTS FROM THE BACKSEAT OF A MOVING. UNMARKED POLICE VEHICLE AND KILLED HIM. THIS IS EQUIVALENT TO A DRIVE BY SHOOTING. THERE'S NO WAY AN OFFICER. COULD I FELL UNDER ANY THREAT FROM THE BACKSEAT OF A MOVING VEHICLE ESPECIALLY ONE WHICH IS NOT EVEN IDENTIFY UP AND IDENTIFIABLE AS A POLICE VEHICLE. AS YOU CAN IMAGINE NOTHING WILL BRING BACK SHAUN. BUT AS F. F. SB TWO NINE NINE HAD ALREADY BEEN A LAW OUR PARENTS WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO TAKE TIME OFF FROM WORK TO MOURN HIM. AND PLANETS FUNERAL. WE HAVE SISTERS COULD HAVE US THAT ACCESS COUNSELING TO HELP US PROCESS OUR GRIEF. AND WE WOULD HAVE BEEN A GOOD KNOWLEDGE THAT'S VICTIMS AND RECEIVE THE SUPPORT AND COMPASSION WE DESERVE. BUT IN REALITY WE WERE MET WITH NONE OF THAT THE LITTLE SUPPORT WE DO HAVE WHAT WE BECAUSE WE HAVE TO FIGHT FOR IT. IN ORDER TO GIVE SEAN HIS PROPER BURIAL OUR FAMILY HOW TO SET UP A GO FUND ME. AND DEPEND ON OUR COMMUNITY TO SUPPORT US THROUGH THE MOST DEVASTATING TIME IN OUR LIVES. FINDING JUSTICE FOR YOUR LOVED ONE IS NOT EASY. MY SISTER AND I HAVE QUIT OUR JOBS. OUR PARENTS WERE ONLY ABLE TO TAKE TWO DAYS OFF WORK TO GRIEVE THE LOSS OF THEIR ONLY SON AND HAVE BEEN WORKING SEVEN DAYS A WEEK WITH NO ACCESS TO COUNSELING OR THERAPY. IMMIGRATED HERE TO GIVE US THE AMERICAN DREAM ONLY TO BE MET WITH AMERICAN NIGHTMARE WHICH IS LOSING YOUR LOVED ONE TO POLICE VIOLENCE. WE NO LONGER HAVE ACCESS TO OUR BROTHER WE CANNOT SPEAK TO HIM LAUGH WITH HIM. OUR MOTHER WILL NEVER SERVE SHAUN ANOTHER MEAL. OUR FATHER WOULD NEVER HOLD SHAWN'S CHILDREN HIS LAP WE FEEL BLESSED AND GRATEFUL TO HAVE. THE SUPPORT OF OUR COMMUNITY DURING THIS TIME BUT NO ONE SHOULD HAVE TO FIGHT FOR JUSTICE AND CARRY ALL THIS PAIN WITH NO RESOURCES OR SUPPORT. NO MATTER WHAT THE POLICE REPORT SAYS THERE WERE FIVE VICTIMS CREATED WHEN MY BROTHER WAS KILLED. MY FAMILY SUFFERED AND THERE ARE TOO MANY FAMILIES LIKE OURS. OUT HERE DEALING WITH THE SAME TRAGEDY. WE'RE THANKFUL FOR THIS BILL AND BEING A PART OF PUSHING THIS CHANGE FOR ALL OF THE SURVIVORS WHOSE FOR. WHOSE DESERVE HELP. IT IS TIME TO CALIFORNIA STANDS BEHIND ALL SURVIVORS SPECIFICALLY FAMILIES AFFECTED BY POLICE VIOLENCE. I ASKED THE ALL VOTE YES ON THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR LABOR FOR THE INTRODUCTION. I'M HERE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF SB TWO NINE NINE WHICH WOULD MAKE VICTIMS COMPENSATION FOR FAMILIES AFFECTED BY POLICE VIOLENCE ATTAINABLE I'M ACTUALLY MONTERROSA THE YOUNGER SURVIVING SISTER MY BROTHER SEAN MONTERROSA WHAT OUR FAMILY HAS BEEN PUT THROUGH BY VALLEJO POLICE DEPARTMENT WILL TAKE MORE OF THE TOP MORE TIME THAN I HAVE YOUR TODAY BUT I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THE WAY IT% ILLUSTRATES THE NEED FOR SB TWO NINE NINE. LOSING SOMEONE YOU LOVE TO VIOLENCE IS AN UNIMAGINABLE PAINT THAT RIPPLES THROUGH EVERY PART OF YOUR LIFE WHEN THAT LOSS COMES AT THE HANDS OF SOMEONE TASKED WITH KEEPING YUR COMMUNITY SAFE AT THE HANDS OF A POLICE OFFICER IT'S ALSO STIGMATIZING AND DESTABILIZING. INSTEAD THERE IS NOW IN SEAN'S PACE AN ACHING VOID OF GRIEF AND ANGER TO ITS CREDIT CALIFORNIA OFFERS SERVER SERVICES TO VICTIMS OF MANY KINDS OF CRIME AND VIOLENCE BUT OUR FAMILY BECAUSE SHAUN'S KILLER HOW TO BATCH QUALIFIES FOR NONE OF THAT. ON JUNE SECOND OF TWENTY TWENTY SEAN WAS KNEELING WITH HIS HANDS UP WHEN OFFICER JR AT TIMES OF THE VALLEJO POLICE DEPARTMENT SHOT THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD OF AN UNMARKED PICKUP TRUCK WITH A R. FIFTEEN. I JUST SO HAPPEN TO TURN TWENTY THE DAY AFTER. SINCE THE MOMENT TO SEAN'S LIFE WAS TAKEN. WE'VE HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO SPRING INTO ACTION. AND CALL FOR JUSTICE. MY SISTER MICHELLE AND I FOR THE PAST YEAR HAVE CONTINUOUSLY HOW TO PUT OUR BODIES ON THE LINE WE QUIT OUR JOBS WE PUT SCHOOL ON HOLD AND I HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO PRINT GRIEF PUBLICLY. JOHN WAS ALSO PROVIDER IN OUR FAMILY NOW OUR PARENTS SPEND THEIR DAYS WORKING TWELVE TO FOURTEEN HOUR SHIFTS SEVEN DAYS A WEEK EVEN THROUGH THEIR GRIEF JUST TO STAY AFLOAT. I SAY THIS TO SHED LIGHT ON HOW FOR IMPACTED FAMILIES WILL GO FOR THEIR LOVED ONES. ALL OF THAT WHILE NOT HAVING ANY TYPE OF ACCESS TO FAMILY THERAPY. GRIEF COUNSELING OR ANY TYPE OF MENTAL HEALTH RESOURCES. THIS IN NO WAY IS AN ISOLATED CASE. THERE ARE MANY OTHER FAMILIES AND NOT JUST IN THE LAB BUT ALL ACROSS OF CALIFORNIA. WHO HAVE SO SIMILAR STORIES ABOUT THE WAYS THAT POLICE MURDERED OUR LOVED ONES THEN LEAVE THE FAMILIES WITH NO RESOURCES TO COVER SPECIFIC EXPENSES SUCH AS MEDICAL BILLS. FUNERAL AND BURIAL EXPENSES. AND COUNSELING MY HOPE IS THAT YOU ALL BEGIN TO CENTER THE VOICES OF MANY IMPACTED FAMILIES LIKE OURS AND REALIZE THE URGENCY. TO GIVE FAMILIES ACCESS OF EVERYTHING SB TWO NINE NINE PROVIDES THANK YOU GOD BLESS YOU ALL.

GIVEN THIS OPENING UP THAT DOOR. I TO RESIST- BE INJURED AND THEN CLAIM VICTIMHOOD- OVER BEING- I OVER THE CONSEQUENCES OF ESSENTIALLY- WHAT IT WAS WAS THEIR BEHAVIOR. AND IN IN THIS BILL- YOU KNOW I SEE A COUPLE OF THE ATM OF ISSUES RELATED TO THAT BUT- YOU KNOW I ALSO SEE- AND I WOULD QUESTION MAYBE YOU CAN ANSWER THIS- IF A PERSON IS OUT. SHOOTING AT PEOPLE BUT DOESN'T REALLY HIT ANYBODY BUT DAN IS- SO DUDE BY THE POLICE ARRIVING POLICE OFFICERS SO THEY MAY NOT HIT ANYBODY. WELL THEY DIDN'T CAUSE ANY INJURY. AND THEREFORE ARE THEY ELIGIBLE FOR THIS THIS VICTIM COMPENSATION FUND. AFTER THEY WERE STOPPED FROM. AFTER FUTURE INYO INJURING SOMETHING IN THE FUTURE. THE SHORT ANSWER IS NOW. SO. IN THE IN THE LANGUAGE. IT SAYS THAT. IF A PERSON IS ACCUSED OF HURTING OR KILLING SOMEONE THE BOARD INSTEAD CHANGE SHALL NOT COMPENSATE THEM IT SAYS MAY DENIED COMPENSATION ACTUALLY THAT ACTUAL LANGUAGE LARGEST WITH SHALL NOT BE ELIGIBLE IT'S VERY CLEAR SO DOES NOT SAY MAY DENY THAT IS CORRECT OKAY DID THAT GET CHANGED YES. OKAY ARGUES THAT THAT ALSO OPENS THE DOOR. IF I MAY RESPOND YES I THINK SOME OF THE CONFUSION FOR SOME FOLKS ON THIS BILL IS WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT INCENTIVIZING FOLKS IT'S NOT LIKE THIS IS A POT OF MONEY AND IF I CLAIM THAT- THE POLICE SHOT ME OR THE POLICE BOBBY- BEAT ME UP OKAY NOW COUNTY LABOR GETS YOU KNOW ONE CAL BCB IS A PAYER OF LAST RESORT AND NUMBER TWO IT'S JUST ABOUT REIMBURSEMENT SO IT'S IF YOU HAD RECEIVED COUNSELING SERVICES BECAUSE YOU WERE TRAUMATIZED BUT BY THE WAY YOU WERE TREATED IF YOU HAD TO RECEIVE- ANY HOT AT THIRTY HOSPITAL BILLS THEY WERE NOT PAID BECAUSE YOU WERE HARMED BY THE POLICE THEY WOULD BE REIMBURSED AND IF GOD FORBID. YOUR FAMILY MEMBER IS KILLED BY POLICE THE FAMILY MEMBER COULD THEN BE ELIGIBLE TO BE REIMBURSED FOR BURIAL EXPENSES SO I THINK THAT'S A VERY BIG DISTINCTION BETWEEN YOU KNOW PEOPLE THINKING THAT THEY'RE GONNA BE INCENTIVIZED TO CLAIM VICTIMHOOD BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO SOMEHOW GET SOME SORT OF MONEY THIS IS ABOUT REIMBURSING PEOPLE FOR TRAUMA THAT THEY HAVE BEEN INCURRED BY THE POLICE BUT ADDED THAT TRAUMA IS ALSO. YOU HAVE TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT HOW IT GOT THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE SOMETIMES YES SOMETIMES NO TIME AND THIS IS NOT ABOUT EVERY PERSON ASSEMBLY MEMBER SAYING THAT EVERY PERSON WHO COMMITS A CRIME SHOULD BE HAVE ACCESS TO CAL B. C. B. I MEAN ANYONE WATCHING THE NEWS OVER THE LAST HOW MANY YEARS COUPLE YEARS. HAS SEEN THAT THE PLEASE DO NOT ALWAYS DO THE RIGHT THING BY FOLKS AND THE SO THIS IS JUST A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE TRUE VICTIMS TO RECEIVE COMPENSATION BE REIMBURSED FOR TRAGEDY OR- TRAUMA THAT THEY HAVE RECEIVED TIME AND IF THEY'RE NOT IF THEY DO THEY ALSO HAVE ACCESS TO THE COURTS WHICH WILL ALLOW THEM MUCH BIGGER COMPENSATION IN THIS WOULD ALLOW AND IF THEY DID GO TO COURT AND THEY WERE GIVEN THE COMPENSATION. THEY HAVE TO PAY BACK CALLUM CB. AT THE END OF LEASE IN MY STE. CALABRESE IS. BEFORE THIS BILL IN BECAUSE EFFECTIVE OTHERS CAN GOES GOVERNOR'S. CALVI C. B. FUNDING THIRTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS. IN TAXPAYER DOLLARS YES BUT IT'S BEEN THERE BEFORE BUT IT'S BEEN THERE BEFORE MR ASSEMBLY MEMBER THIS BILL. NOT CREATE CALVI CB UNDERSTOOD THANK YOU THANK YOU THERE'S JUST I THINK IT WAS FUNDED A DIFFERENT WAY BEFORE. IT WAS FUNDED BY. YEAH THERE IS A DIFFERENCE THERE WAS YES YES OKAY THANK YOU ASSEMBLY OF CORK- YES SO. THERE'S SOME JUST I DON'T KNOW THAT THIS WILL CONVINCE MR SAY ARE TRANSPORTED PROBABLY WON'T BUT IN PARTICULAR THE BILL ALLOWS AN EXCLUSION BASED ON WHETHER THE VICTIM COULD HAVE FORESEEN THAT ILLEGAL CONTACT WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN INJURY SO IF YOU HAVE SOMEONE WHO CAN HOUSE SALSA POLICE OFFICER- MY GUESS IS THAT THEY WOULD DECIDE THAT WHATEVER THE POLICE OFFICER DID IN THAT CASE. WHAT'S TO BE EXPECTED SO YOU KNOW IT DOES HAVE THAT EXCLUSION AND IT. SO I THINK THAT WHAT THESENATORS TRYING TO DO IS TO TAKE CARE OF PEOPLE WHO- FRANKLY HAVE BEEN ABUSED BY POLICE I THINK THAT'S THE- THE INTENT AND I BELIEVE THE WAY THIS IS WRITTEN THAT'S THE WAY THIS WOULD HAPPEN. THANK YOU. MISS BURKE A HAND THANK YOU MR VICE CHAIR- I JUST WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR HER WORK TO THE POINT AND THAT MISTER CLARK JUST MADE THIS IS THAT HAVE NARROWLY CRAFTED BILL AND WE KNOW THAT GEORGE FLOOD WAS A VICTIM. AND HE'S NOT THE ONLY ONE. AND SO WE KNOW THAT CALIFORNIANS AND PEOPLE ACROSS THIS COUNTRY CAN BE THE VICTIMS EVEN IF IT IS AT THE HANDS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. ND SO TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT AND TO GIVE THEM ACCESS TO THESE FUNDS IF THEY ARE THE VICTIMS IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. SO I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THAT AND I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT AND I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT. YOU WORKED HARD TO ENSURE THAT IT IS THE VICTIMS THAT ARE GETTING THESE FUNDS AND I APPRECIATE THAT AND I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT IT TODAY. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY WOMAN. OKAY IS THERE ANY OTHER COMMENTS FROM. MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. SEEING NONE- LET ME JUST CLARIFY THAT YOU'RE ACCEPTING AMENDMENTS THAT WERE PROPOSED TO YOU YES I DO YOU MAY CLOSE MATCH. MEMBERS I WOULD JUST RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE AS I STATED EARLIER THIS IS NOT A POT OF MONEY FOR PEOPLE TO RECEIVE THAT AS MR FALCO DESCRIBED THAT'S WHAT THE COURTS ARE FOR THAT IS IN CIVIL PENALTIES COULD BE THE CASE THIS IS ABOUT REIMBURSING VICTIMS. FOR SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED TO THEM AND IT'S REIMBURSING HOSPITAL BILLS COUNSELING BILLS OR GOD FORBID IF YOUR LOVED ONE WAS KILLED BY POLICE YOU CAN GET THE FUNERAL COSTS REIMBURSED MEMBERS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR- VOTE. OKAY THANK YOU I DO THINK THE CHAIRS RECOMMENDED. AS SUPPORT AS AMENDED. AND WITH THAT WILL CALL FOR THE QUESTION. THE BILL'S IMPROPERLY MOVED AND SECONDED ON SB TWO NINETY NINE BY SENATOR LEAVE THAT THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER. BLACKIE NOT LACKING NOW BARRICADE HAND PACKING HANNAH HI LETE LETE HAI CORK CORK I SANTIAGO. THEY ARE TO THE R. TEN NO WICKS WICKS I. BUT MEMBERS ON COLLEGE MORE THANK YOU MR VICE CHAIR THANK YOU MEMBERS THANK YOU CENTER. CENTER RUBIO. SB. FIVE THIRTY EIGHT. THANK YOU. MAY I BEGIN I'M SORRY YES YOU MAY BEGIN THANK YOU AT TEARS MEMBER THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT TODAY SB FIVE THIRTY EIGHT WHICH IS A CRITICAL MEASURE FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SURVIVORS SEEKING PROTECTION FROM THEIR ABUSERS. THANK YOU SENATE BILL FIVE THIRTY WILL THAT JUST SIMPLY VICTIMS TO FILE ELECTRONICALLY. AND ALSO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY REMOTELY- I WOULD LIKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO INVITE ONE OF MY- SPEAKERS WHO'S HERE WITH US TODAY TO JUST REALLY BRIEFLY TELL HER TESTIMONY- AND THAT IS I HAVE ON THE LINE DIANNE DOROTHY BUT HERE IN PERSON I HAVE RAINY. FROM AREAS WHO WILL SPEAK ABOUT HER EXPERIENCES. SHOW ME THANK YOU YES YOU MAY PROCEED. MY NAME IS RENEE WERE MERITS MY IT CAN HERE OKAY I'M SORRY- COULD YOU ADJUST THE MICROPHONE SO IT'S NEAR- YOUR YOUR- THAT BETTER YEAH THAT'S MUCH BETTER- MY NAME IS RAINER MASS MY FOR ADULT CHILDREN. AGES TWENTY TO TWENTY FIVE AND I. ARE SURVIVORS OF AN OFFICER INVOLVED DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. BIPARTISAN BILLS AND CRY- WE WERE GRANTED A FIVE YEAR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDER ON JUNE TWENTY SEVENTH I APOLOGIZE. TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN AND ARE PURSUING OVER NO RESTRAINING ORDER ON JULY SIXTH AGAINST THE EX SPOUSE. THE CHILDREN'S FATHER. SB FIVE THIRTY EIGHT IS IMPORTANT TO MYSELF. AND MY CHILDREN BECAUSE IT WILL ALLOW REMOTE TESTIFYING FOR OTHERS LIKE US I HAD TO SIT LESS THAN FOUR FEET AWAY FROM THE ABUSER WHEN PLEADING FOR MY RESTRAINING ORDER. ONLY MY CONFIDENCE FROM THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SHELTER ADVOCATE SEATED BETWEEN MYSELF AND THE ABUSER. MY OLDEST SON TESTIFYING IN FRONT OF THE ABUSER HIS FATHER THAT DAY. REMOTEST THE MONEY ALSO MEANS OF THE ABUSER WILL NOT HAVE OPPORTUNITY TO PSYCHOLOGICALLY OR PHYSICALLY INTIMIDATE THE VICTIM IN PERSON EXAMPLE IN MY CASE AFTER THE HEARING. THE ABUSER REPEATEDLY PASSED ME IN A VEHICLE AT A TIME TO GET MINE AFTER COURT. I CANNOT EMPHASIZE ENOUGH HOW ALL ASPECTS OF THIS BILL WILL HELP OTHER VICTIMS BECOME SURVIVORS LIKE MYSELF. ALL ABUSED BECAUSE OF PSYCHOLOGICAL ABUSE THEN PHYSICAL ABUSE LIKE WHAT I UNDER BEGINS. THE EXPERIENCE OF COURTS IS TAXI IN ITSELF BUT THE FIFTY ABUSER IN A COURT ROOM IN THE WHOLE OF THE COURTROOM IS SCARY BECAUSE THIS IS STILL THE TIME OF FLIGHT OR FIGHT MODE FOR THE VICTIM. TAKING AWAY THE POLITICAL INTIMIDATION POWER OF THE ABUSER WITH REMOTE TESTIMONY AND ELECTRONIC FILING FOR THE VICTIMS IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. OF HEALING THE VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE LIKE MYSELF. THANK YOU SENATOR RUBIO FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY. ON THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS BILL I WAS SILENT FOR SO LONG IN A BRIEF EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK UP NOW ABOUT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. THANK YOU MA'AM. AT&amp;T OPERATOR IF WE COULD GET- MISS DORMITORY- FROM THE SAN DIEGO CITY ATTORNEY'S OFFICE SHE'S ON THE LINE WE'D LOVE TO HEAR TESTIMONY. THANK YOU SENATOR RUBIO MISTER RAMIREZ MR CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS WE ARE SO GRATEFUL FOR SENATOR RUBIO LEADERSHIP ON THIS IMPORTANT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ISSUE I AM DAY AND ALREADY I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE SAN DIEGO COUNTY JUSTICE CENTER. DALY DOESN'T CENTER HAS HELPED THOUSANDS OF VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN HAS PROVIDED ASSISTANCE TO VICTIMS OF SEX TRAFFICKING. AS SOMEONE WHO WORKS WITH SURVIVORS ON A DAILY BASIS I KNOW FIRST HAND HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO PROTECT THEM FROM BEING RE VICTIMIZED BY THEIR ABUSERS AS MISS RAMIREZ JUST STATED. ANY SHOW THAT THE BEING TIMES ARE OF THE- VIOLENCE COM WHEN THE VICTIM DECIDES TO LEAVE THE RELATIONSHIP AND WHEN SEEKING A RESTRAINING ORDER. NEEDS IMMENSE ANGER THEIR ABUSERS AND PROVIDE THEM WITH OPPORTUNITIES TO RETALIATE. I TESTIFYING REMOTELY VICTIMS ARE ABLE TO TELL THEIR STORY TO THE COURT WITHOUT FEAR OF PHYSICAL RETALIATION INTIMIDATION. THREATS AND COERCION. BY THE TIME BY THE DEFENDANT AND THE DEFENDANT FAMILY BEFORE DURING AND- AFTER THAT COURT HEARING. AT THE FAMILY DOESN'T MATTER WE'VE CREATED A SPACE WHERE CLIENTS CAN SAFELY SPEAK TO THE COURT IN A CALM ENVIRONMENT THAT IS FREE OF STRESS AND INTIMIDATION BY THEIR ABUSER AS WELL AS THE CONFUSION OF THE COURTHOUSE. HIS FACE STATE AND STATE AND FREE FROM THE TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCES. WITH DRIVE TIME IS RAMIREZ. CALIFORNIA COURTS HAVE NOW HAD MONTHS OF VALUABLE EXPERIENCE WITH REMOTE TESTIMONY AND IT IS WORKING WELL. IT'S REMOTE TESTIMONY IF DISTRICT AND THE VIOLENCE BY FREEING THEM FROM THE EVERYDAY FEAR OF THE COURTHOUSE AND ALSO BENEFITS THE ORDERLY AND EFFICIENT CONDUCT OF THE COURTROOM. ON BEHALF OF THE VICTIMS OF SAN DIEGO I URGE OU TO PLEASE PUT VICTIMS FIRST AND FOREMOST AND KEEP THEIR FAMILIES SAFE BY VOTING IN FAVOR OF SB FIVE THIRTY EIGHT. THANK YOU.

OKAY AND I DO BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE- MISS LIBBY SANCHEZ. SPEAKING AS A WITNESS. FROM SEIU. YES GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS WOULD YOU STAND AS ON BEHALF OF THE AT THE ARE YOU CALIFORNIA IN REQUEST TO OPPOSITION TO SB FIVE THIRTY EIGHT UNLESS IT IS AMENDED TO ADDRESS OUR CONCERNS WELL WE ABSOLUTELY SHARE THE CONCERNS EXPRESSED BY THE AUTHOR AND WITNESSES REGARDING THE VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC AND GUN VIOLENCE WE ARE CONCERNED THAT THE BILL'S PROVISIONS AUTHORIZING PARTIES AND WITNESSES TO APPEAR REMOTELY AND RESTRAINING ORDER PROCEEDINGS WILL RESULT IN UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES AS THEY RELATE THE PARTY'S RIGHTS UNDER THE LAW. UNLESS THE BILL AS AMENDED TO INCORPORATE PROTECTIONS AGAINST THOSE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES AT THE ARE YOU CALIFORNIA REPRESENTS OFFICIAL COURT REPORTERS EMPLOYED BY THE COURT THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DURING THE PANDEMIC PROCEEDINGS WERE CONDUCTED REMOTELY AND WITNESSES APPEARED REMOTELY UNDER THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL'S EMERGENCY ORDER PERMITTING SAME MY COURT REPORTERS EXPERIENCE ATTEMPTING TO ENSURE THE SANCTITY OF THE OFFICIAL VERBATIM RECORD UNDER THESE CONDITIONS HAS BEEN RIFE WITH PROBLEMS JUST AS WE ALL HAVE EXPERIENCED IN COMMITTEE HEARINGS IN CALLS OR ANY OTHER TECHNOLOGICAL PLATFORM UPON WHICH WE RELY DURING THE PANDEMIC. THINGS ARE SIMPLY NOT WORKING HARDIEST WITNESSES LAWYERS HAVE AT TIMES BEEN IMPOSSIBLE TO HEAR COURT REPORTERS HAVE HAD DIFFICULTY ALERTING JUDGES TO TECHNOLOGICAL OR AUDIBILITY CONCERNS DROPPED LINES AN ERRANT SHOOTINGS HAVE OCCURRED BACKGROUND NOISE AND SHODDY TECHNOLOGY A DEGRADED PATH TO MONEY TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT IT HAS SIMPLY BEEN IMPOSSIBLE TO TRANSCRIBE THE OFFICIAL VERBATIM RECORD SHOULD THE COURT REPORTER CANNOT TRANSCRIBE EVERY WORD UTTERED IN A PROCEEDING THE TRANSCRIPT PRODUCED IS UNFORTUNATELY UNVIABLE FOR PURPOSES OF FUTURE USE. OF THE TRANSCRIPT IS REQUIRED TO EXERCISE ONE'S RIGHTS ON APPEAL THE UNFORTUNATE TRAJECTORY OF PERMITTING PARTIES AND WITNESSES TO APPEAR REMOTELY THAT SUCH PARTY IS MAYBE GIVING UP THEIR RIGHTS ON APPEAL WITHOUT. EVEN KNOWING THEY ARE DOING THAT THIS CAN BE. PROBLEM WHERE AS HAPPENS OFTEN IN MY COURT THE BRIDGE. ORDER PARTY IS NOW A- FOR. BUT INSTEAD IS THE JOINT PROCEEDING WITH AN UNDERLYING CRIMINAL PROCEEDING. THERE ARE SEVERAL WAYS TO PROTECT AGAINST THAT FIRST REQUIRE AN OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER EMPLOYED BY THE COURT SHOULD BE IN THE COURTROOM. ALONG WITH THE PRESIDING OFFICER ANYTIME THERE IS A REMOTE APPEARANCE. TO REQUIRE A JUDICIAL ADMONITION FROM THE PRESIDING OFFICER ADVISING PARTIES OF THEIR RIGHTS AND THE POTENTIAL IMPLICATIONS TO THOSE RIGHT. AND THE OFFICIAL VERBATIM RECORD WHERE A PARTY OR WITNESS APPEARS REMOTELY AND FINALLY THREE. A LIMITATION OF AUTHORIZATION FOR REMOTE APPEARANCES TO ONLY THOSE INSTANCES WHERE THE RESTRAINING ORDER IS A STANDALONE PROCEEDING.

AMADOR ADDITIONAL COMMENTS IN QUEUE AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU WILL NOW COME TO COMMITTEE MEMBERS. IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO- YES. MEMBERS YEAH I WOULD JUST SUGGEST TO SEIU IN THE COURT REPORTERS THAT THE WAY TO FIX THIS. IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS GOOD TECHNOLOGY THERE ARE YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN ATTENDING TO MISS YOU SO MEETINGS FOR A YEAR. I HEAR THE PEOPLE JUST AS WELL ON SOON AS I WOULD IF THEY WERE IN PERSON. YOU ALSO HAVE THE OPTION OF RECORDING THE WHOLE THING- THAT'S JUST. YOU KNOW ONE OPTION- YOU JUST PRESSED SOMETHING AND IT RECORDS SO I JUST DON'T SEE THE TECHNICAL DIFFICULTY OF A COURT REPORTER IF THERE IS RELIABLE TECHNOLOGY. ARE HEARING THIS AND I THINK THAT THE PROPER SOLUTION TO THIS WOULD BE TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS PROPER TECHNOLOGY IF THERE'S NOT. PLEASE CONTACT ME AND I'LL MAKE SURE I RUN A BILL TO MAKE SURE OF THAT NEXT YEAR THANK YOU. AND I SUPPORT YOUR BILL 100% WE'VE ALREADY MOVED IT AND SO I'LL BE VOTING NINE. OKAY NOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. WELL FIRST I JUST WANT UP YOU DON'T KNOWLEDGE THE COMMENTS OF A CA YOU- I DON'T WANT TO DISMISS SOME ANTI WILL CONTINUE TO TAKE YOUR THEIR CONCERNS BUT- AS STATED THAT WE ALREADY HAVE A LOT OF COUNTIES WHO'VE ALREADY GONE REMOTELY BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC AND- AS ALL OF US ZOOMING THROUGHOUT. THE YEAR WE'VE LEARNED HOW TO GET BETTER AT IT BUT THE GOAL IS TO MAKE IT JUST EASIER FOR VICTIMS TO COME OUT OF THE SHADOWS AND FEEL CONFIDENT THAT THEY CAN-SPEAK UP IN FRONT OF THEIR ABUSER. BUT I WANT TO MAKE TWO POINTS CLEAR NUMBER ONE THIS DOES NOT ALTER DUE PROCESS AND ANYWAY THIS IS JUST ABOUT CREATING ACCESS AND NUMBER TWO- AND I HAVE TO SAY THIS YOU KNOW EVERY DAY FOR A VICTIM TO BE IN FRONT OTHER ABUSERS MAY BE THEIR LAST SO THIS IS CRITICAL. SPEAKING WITH THAT RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR RIVAL THANK YOU. WELL I CLEARLY IN APPRECIATIVE OF THIS. MEASURES I'M A CO AUTHOR. AND I BELIEVE THAT THE CHAIR IS ALSO RECOMMENDING AN AYE VOTE WITHOUT WILL GO AND TO CALL FOR THE QUESTION. AN SB FIVE THREE EIGHT BY SENATOR RUBIO THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER. LACKEY LACKEY I BARAKAT BARAKAT HAD HI LEE. LEE I CORK BY CORK I SANTIAGO. C. R. TWO C. R. TWO I WICKS. CONGRADULATIONS THAT MEASURE PASSES KATHY. I THINK WE'RE JUST WAITING FOR SKINNER AND STERN IPHONE. WE ALSO GOT LEADERS HE WOULD SHOW UP AND. YEAH YEAH YEAH. YOU KNOW I DON'T. SO SHOULD WE CALL STERN. BURKE YEAH- THE PROPOSAL. NUMBER FOUR SECURITIES WITH SOME REQUEST THE WHOLE. THREE ONE. SO WE WEREN'T REALLY SURE YEAH. THE FIRM. YEAH. THREE WELL. THIS DEGREE OF. I'M MEMBERS- FIRST WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE AND COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH US AND I JUST WANNA SAY I FOUND THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS EXTREMELY THOROUGH AND INFORMATIVE PARTICULARLY IN TALKING ABOUT THE SCIENTIFIC- FOR- FOR THE MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTION BENEFITS OF PSYCHEDELICS AND SO I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT THEIR ANALYSIS AND WE ARE- HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE- PROPOSED AMENDMENT IN ANALYSIS- REMOVING CADMIUM- FROM THE BILL CAN I MEAN THERE'S HUGE BENEFITS IN TERMS OF TREATING SEVERE DEPRESSION- BUT WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE CONCERNS ABOUT IT IN ADDITION TO CAN BE PRESCRIBED- BY A PHYSICIAN SO WERE WILL BE MOVING OUT FROM THE BILL- IN ACCORDANCE WITH- OUR DISCUSSIONS WITH THE COMMITTEE. AND THEN THERE ARE SOME OTHER TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS ARE HAPPY TO ACCEPT- AS WELL I COLLEAGUES- SB FIVE NINETEEN WILL DECRIMINALIZE THE POSSESSION- AND PERSONAL USE OF- PSILOCYBIN PSILOCIN AND DNA LSD DMT MESCALINE AIBO GAMES ARE ONLY. FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE. ONLY FOR WHO ARE TWENTY. AND OLDER THE BILL IS NO APPLICATION TO ANYONE UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY ONE. AND WE MODEL THAT STRUCTURE OVER THE APPROACH. TO CANNABIS. SO WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THE CRIMINALIZES BEEN SOME QUESTIONS AND PEOPLE SOMETIMES HEAR THE WORD. AND THEY DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT IT MEANS. WHEN WE SAY THEY CRIMINALIZE WHAT WE MEAN IS THAT UNDER SB FIVE NINETEEN. WE WILL NO LONGER ARREST PEOPLE AND INCARCERATE THEM. FOR THE SIMPLE PERSONAL POSSESSION. OF PSYCHEDELICS FOR PERSONAL. OR SHARED USE SO THAT'S REALLY THE QUESTION HERE- DO WE BELIEVE. THAT WE SHOULD BE ARRESTING SOMEONE. BECAUSE THEY POSSESS PSYCHEDELICS. FOR PERSONAL USE. I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD FRANKLY I THINK MOST PEOPLE DON'T THINK WE SHOULD BE DOING THAT. THE BILL DOES NOT DECRIMINALIZE THE SALE OF PSYCHEDELICS THAT WILL CONTINUE. TO BE A CRIME. TO PROMOTE SAFER USE THE BILL ALSO DECRIMINALIZE IS DRUG TESTING KITS SO THAT PEOPLE CAN ACTUALLY TEST SWAB ANTESTOR PSYCHEDELICS TO CONFIRM THAT THEY ARE NOT CONTAMINATED THAT IS SOMETHING WE SHOULD BE PROMOTING FOR ALL DRUG USE PARTICULARLY WITH A FENCE IN A LOCKED THEM BACK. IN TERMS OF MATH AD HER WHEN THAT'S BEING LACED BUT HERE WHERE SPECIFICALLY THE CRIMINALIZING OF FOR PSYCHEDELICS. SB FIVE NINETEEN ALSO CONVENES AN EXPERT WORKING GROUP. UNDER THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH TO DEVELOP RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING POTENTIAL FUTURE STRATEGIES. AROUND SAFE USE THAT CETERA OF PSYCHEDELICS. SINCE THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF MISINFORMATION ABOUT THIS BILL AND I SUSPECT YOU WILL HEAR SOME OF THAT IN THE PUBLIC COMMENT TODAY FRANKLY SOME OUTRAGEOUS MISREPRESENTATIONS AROUND THE BILL. JUST TO CLARIFY THE BILL DOES NOT DECRIMINALIZE THE SALE OF PSYCHEDELICS. IT DOES NOT DECRIMINALIZE. IN ANYWAY GIVING OR SHARING OR OTHERWISE PROVIDING PSYCHEDELICS TO ANYONE UNDER TWENTY ONE. ALL THAT WILL REMAIN ILLEGAL. WHAT SB FIVE NINETEEN DIES IS ENSURE THAT PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS WITHOUT BEING A CRIMINAL. TO SUBSTANCES THAT ARE LITERALLY FIXING PEOPLE'S BRAINS. LITERALLY ENDING MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTION DIAGNOSES NOT ONLY IMPROVING CONDITIONS BUT ACCORDING THIS RECENT SCIENTIFIC STUDIES FOR EXAMPLE AROUND MDMA. MAKING IT TO THE PEOPLE WITH PTSD NO LONGER HAVE A PTSD DIAGNOSIS. BUT SOMEONE ADDICTED TO HEROIN IS NO LONGER ADDICTED TO HER OR NOT JUST IMPROVING. DOT TO BUT SITUATION WHERE PEOPLE'S LIVES ARE LITERALLY TRANSFORMS BECAUSE OF THESE SUBSTANCES. FOR FAR TOO LONG THE ONLY REGULATIONS THAT WE KIND OF THESE SUBSTANCES IS THE SAY IF YOU POSSESS AND USE THAT YOU'RE A CRIMINAL AND YOU MIGHT GET ARRESTED AND PUT IN PRISON. RATHER THAN PROPERLY EVEN TRYING TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN DIFFERENT DRUG SUBSTANCES. WE JUST TREAT EVERYTHING AS SOMEHOW MORALLY. IN GENERAL HAS BEEN A FAILURE WE WERE TRYING TO ARREST OUR WAY OUT OF DRUG USE AND ADDICTION FOR FIFTY YEARS AND IT HASN'T IMPROVED ANYTHING WHATSOEVER PEOPLE ARE STILL USING- PEOPLE ARE STILL GETTING ADDICTED NOT TO PSYCHEDELICS BECAUSE THESE ARE GENERALLY NOT ADDICTIVE BUT OTHER DRUGS. AND ALL WE'VE DONE IS FILL UP OUR PRISON WITH DRUG CRIMES AND WE'RE NOT SAFER AND WE JUST SPENT A WHOLE LOT OF MONEY- THE FAILED WAR ON DRUGS. HAS BEEN A HUGE BURDEN ON TAX REVENUES TORN COMMUNITIES APART IT HAS DRAMATICALLY HARM BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES AND HAS DONE NOTHING TO MAKE THE COMMUNITY SAFER. OR TO MAKE PEOPLE SAFER IF THEY'RE USING DRUGS IN FACT IT'S MADE US LESS SAFE BECAUSE PEOPLE USE IN THE SHADOWS THEY KNOW THAT THEY'RE COMMITTING A CRIME AND SO THEY DON'T GET INFORMATION. AND EDUCATION. THAT COULD LET THEM BE SAFER. IT'S TIME THAT WE STOP OUR FAILED POLICY OF MASS INCARCERATION IN THE KNOWLEDGE. THAT NOT EVERY SUBSTANCE IS HARMFUL. JUST BECAUSE- A HUNDRED OR FIFTY YEARS AGO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DECLARED THAT A PARTICULAR SUBSTANCE. IS SOMEHOW BAD AND THUS ILLEGAL. THE SUBSTANCES IN THIS BILL HAVE BEEN FOUND NOT JUST BY POLITICIANS OR ADVOCATES BY SCIENTISTS BY SCIENTIFIC STUDIES INCLUDING AND IN NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE STUDIES AFFILIATED WITH THE FTA. BUT A MYRIAD OF MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES INCLUDING ANXIETY ADDICTION DEPRESSION INSOMNIA EATING DISORDERS PTSD SMOKING. CAN BE DRAMATICALLY IMPROVES WITH PSYCHEDELIC THERAPY. VETERANS AND MANY OF YOU ARE PROBABLY I HOPE MATTER HEARD FROM OUR VETERANS ARE SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OR TO ORGANIZATIONS OF COMBAT VETERANS WHO WORK WITH VETERANS WHO HAVE GONE TO WAR FOR OUR COUNTRY AND BEEN HARMED AS A RESULT AND COME BACK WITH PTSD WITH SEVERE DEPRESSION WITH OTHER. DISORDERS AND YOU TREATMENT TRADITIONAL TREATMENT HASN'T WORKED. AND PSYCHEDELIC THERAPY HAS ALLOWED THEM TO GET THEIR LIVES BACK AND YET WE FORCED THEM TO GO TO PERU OR MEXICO OR TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY. TO GET THIS TREATMENT AFTER THEY FOUGHT FOR OUR COUNTRY BECAUSE WE MADE IT ILLEGAL HERE. EIGHTEEN VETERANS COMMIT SUICIDE EVERY SINGLE DAY IN THIS COUNTRY EIGHTEEN EVERYDAY COMMENSURATE SIDE. WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO HELP THEM AMONG OTHER NOT JUST VETERANS AMONG OTHERS. ACTUALLY TURN THEIR LIVES AROUND. THESE IMPACTS HAVE BEEN FOUND BOTH IN A CLINICAL SETTING. IT ALSO IN NON CLINICAL SETTINGS AND IT'S TIME WE ACKNOWLEDGE THE BENEFITS OF THESE SUBSTANCES EVEN OUTSIDE OF A CLINICAL SETTING. I WANT TO BE CLEAR I SAID THIS EARLIER THAT PSYCHEDELICS ARE OVERWHELMINGLY NOT A DETECTIVE. AND PEOPLE CAN USE THEM SAFELY. BUT IT'S HARDER TO USE THEM SAFELY IF PEOPLE ARE CRIMINALIZED FOR DOING SO. BECAUSE YOU MAY HAVE SEEN THAT LAST NOVEMBER OREGON VOTERS. VOTED TO DECRIMINALIZE NOT TO PSYCHEDELICS BUT POSSESSION OF ALL DRUGS. EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM. THE MAIN HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES BECAUSE SOMETIMES WE THINK WE HAVE TO GO TO THE VOTERS FOR THESE THINGS THE MAIN HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES JUST VOTED TO DECRIMINALIZE THE POSSESSION OF ALL DRUGS A WEEK OR TWO AGO. WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING EVEN THOUGH I SUPPORT THOSE EFFORTS AND I HOPE CALIFORNIA GETS THERE IN THIS BILL WE'RE PROPOSING A MUCH NARROWER SUBSET. OF THOSE STOPS. WE KNOW THE PORTUGAL DECRIMINALIZED POSSESSION. AND WHAT TYPE THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF GLOOM AND DOOM PREDICTIONS ABOUT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IN PORTUGAL. WHAT HAPPENED IN PORTUGAL. OVERDOSE DEATHS. WENT DOWN HIV INFECTIONS WENT DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY. BECAUSE THEY STARTED TO TREAT DRUGS AS WHAT IT IS IT'S A HEALTH ISSUE NOT A CRIMINAL ISSUE. I KNOW THAT THERE IS A LOT OF FEAR THAT COULD SPREAD ABOUT PSYCHEDELICS. PEOPLE YOU KNOW GO BACK TO THE NINETEEN SIXTIES IT'S LIKE THE PSYCHEDELIC EQUIVALENT OF REEFER MADNESS THAT THIS IS GONNA LIKE DO ALL SORTS OF HORRIBLE THINGS. AND THAT IS JUST NOT TRUE ANY SUBSTANCE CAN BE MISUSED. I COULD GO HOME TONIGHT AND TAKE TOO MANY SLEEPING PILLS. AND HARM MYSELF YOU COULD TAKE TOO MUCH COUGH SYRUP. AND HARM YOURSELF YOU TAKE TOO MANY TYLENOL AND HARMS OF ANY SUBSTANCE IN THE WORLD CAN BE MISUSED AND THAT'S WHY I WANT TO GET PEOPLE HELPING EDUCATION INSTEAD OF ARRESTING THEM. BUT WE NEED TO BE CLEAR THAT PROHIBITION DOESN'T WORK IT DIDN'T WORK WITH ALCOHOL HASN'T WORKED IN THE WAR ON DRUGS AND SPECIFICALLY IT DOESN'T WORK WITH PSYCHEDELICS SO COLLEAGUES I ASKED FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO TO MOVE THIS BILL FORWARD- TAKE A HEALTH BASED BASED APPROACH TO THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE- WITH ME TODAY TESTIFIED. HARD ADJUSTING RULED WHO IS THE PRESIDENT AND FOUNDER OF THE HERO CARTS PROJECT- A COMBAT VETERANS ORGANIZATION AND A CO SPONSOR OF SB FIVE NINETEEN. AND DR ROBERT GRANT A PROFESSOR OF MEDICINE AT UC US OFF. THANK YOU. YES SIR YOU MAY PROCEED AT THE MIKE. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS JESSE GOLD AND I'M THE FOUNDER PRO CARDS PROJECT WHICH IS CO SPONSOR CALIFORNIA BILL SB FIVE ONE NINE. I COULD NEVER IMAGINE BEING IN THIS POSITION TODAY ADVOCATING FOR PSYCHEDELIC MEDICINE BUT I'VE ALWAYS FOLLOWED MY HEART AND INTUITION THAT HAS CONSISTENTLY LED ME ON A LIFE OF SERVICE. BEFORE THE MILITARY I WAS IN FINANCE ON WALL STREET BUT I DECIDED TO ENLIST IN THE ARMY TO GIVE BACK AND SERVE THIS GREAT COUNTRY. I FOUND COMMUNITY IN PURPOSE AS AN AIRBORNE RANGER AND I DEVELOPED AS A LEADER AS A NONCOMMISSIONED OFFICER OVER THREE COMBAT DEPLOYMENTS. I MADE A PLEDGE TO LEAVE NO SOLDIER BEHIND. THE FIRST FOUND PSYCHEDELIC MEDICINES OUT OF NECESSITY. HAVING TRIED ALL THAT WAS OFFERED TO ME BY MILITARY MEDICINE I WAS BARELY HOLDING ON. I TURNED TO PSYCHEDELICS AS A LAST DITCH EFFORT TO SURVIVE. AND FORTUNATELY IT WORKED AMAZINGLY WELL- CARDS PROJECT WAS CREATED EDUCATE AND CONNECT MY FELLOW VETERANS TO THESE EFFECTIVE OPTIONS. THIS WAS NEARLY FOUR AND A HALF YEARS AGO AND SINCE THEN I'VE BEEN ON THE FRONT LINES OF THE VETERAN SUICIDE EPIDEMIC THAT SENATOR WIENER RECENTLY MENTIONED. NEARLY EVERY DAY MY TEAM RECEIVES MESSAGES FROM VETERANS WHO HAVE FALLEN THROUGH THE CRACKS OF THE SYSTEM OR FROM THEIR FAMILIES WHO ARE EXHAUSTED AND DESPERATE BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF OPTIONS. IT IS HARD TO PUT INTO WORDS HOW MUCH THIS CRISIS HAS DECIMATED THE MILITARY COMMUNITY MY COMMUNITY. THE WEIGHT OF IT ALL HAS FALLEN ON INDIVIDUALS AND PRIVATE ORGANIZATIONS MANY OF WHICH ARE AT A BREAKING POINT. JUST LAST MONTH ANOTHER FRIEND OF MINE. A VETERAN TOOK HIS OWN LIFE. HE WAS DOING HIS BEST TO SAVE OTHERS BUT IT CAME AT THE EXPENSE OF HIS OWN MENTAL HEALTH. VETERANS SHOULD NOT HAVE TO FACE THIS ALONE AND IN THE SHADOWS. BUT THEY ARE DOING THAT RIGHT NOW. THE CRIMINALITY IS NOT AFFECTED THEIR ABILITY TO GO THERE THEY ARE EITHER HAVING TO GO TO OTHER COUNTRIES OR FORMING THEIR OWN GROUPS PURELY TO SAVE THEIR OWN LIVES. AT THE VETERANS SUPPORT. PSYCHEDELICS HAVE AND WILL CONTINUE TO SAY THAT OUR LIVES. JUST RECENTLY THE DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF HEALTH PRETTY PSYCHEDELIC POTENTIAL AS A THERAPEUTIC TREATMENT. A SENTIMENT HAS BEEN ECHOED BY THE FDA AS WELL AS PROMINENT UNIVERSITIES LIKE JOHNS HOPKINS. THE VETERANS ARE DYING TODAY RIGHT NOW. SB FIVE ONE NINE IS A COMPASSIONATE STEP FORWARD AND PROVIDES A MEASURE OF HOPE IN A TIME FRAME OF MONTHS NOT YEARS TO THOSE ARE BARELY HOLDING ON RIGHT NOW.

I DON'T SEE MISTER LIU NEAR ME YES WHO IS THIS. YEAH THIS IS JOHN LEVEL HI JOHN YOU MAY BEGIN WHENEVER YOU'RE READY HI HOW ARE YOU GOOD- YES- BUT FIRST OF ALL LET ME SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT ALONG. THE CALIFORNIA NARCOTIC OFFICERS ASSOCIATION IS NOT ABOUT INCARCERATING PEOPLE FOR POSSESSION IN FACT UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW NOW WITH PROPOSITION THIRTY SIX WITH A WHOLE HOST OF DRUG COURT INTERVENTIONS AND TREATMENT- THAT'S A THAT'S A GOOD PATHWAY FOR- FOR- POSSESSION. WELL ISSUES BUT I WANT TO JUST TALK ABOUT TWO ISSUES VERY QUICKLY- THE FIRST FEELS WEIRD- LSD- THE- PROBLEM WITH THE CHALLENGE WITH LSD. IS THAT IT IS MARRIED TO FLASHBACKS AND THAT'S A CONSTANT- KILL YOU ONE QUICK FAMILY STORY A FAMILY MEMBER OF MINE- WHEN SHE WAS EIGHTEEN. WAS GIVEN LSD SURREPTITIOUSLY SHE WASN'T AWARE OF THAT. AND SHE WOUND UP BEING HOSPITALIZED AND RAN FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS SHE HAD FLASHBACKS. YEAH BEFORE THIS BILL WAS HEARD I ACTUALLY CALLED HER AND I SAID WHEN WAS YOUR LAST FLASHBACK AND SHE SAID TO ME JOHN I STILL GET THE I DON'T GET THEM AS OFTEN BUT I STILL GET THEM. AND THIS IS IN FLASHBACKS ARE NOT WELL JUST ONE FAMILY NARRATION- TODAY I'D ACTUALLY- GOOGLE- FLASHBACKS BECAUSE BY L. A. B. AND I GOT OVER TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND ENTRIES ON THE ON THE INTERNET- AND- WE BELIEVE IT'S IRRESPONSIBLE. TO PUT SOMETHING OUT THERE THAT YOU KNOW TRACK IS A TRIP PEOPLE CAN HAVE FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES. THE OTHER ISSUE WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT USING SOCIAL SHARING. WE ARE VERY CAREFUL THAT WE ARE NOT INTENDED CONSEQUENCE OF THAT WILL ACTUALLY BE TO INCREASE. OVER THE METALLIC- OVER IN THE SENATE EARLIER THIS YEAR THERE WAS A BILL DEALING WITH. OPIOID OF CALORIES OR FAT NOW- THE CALORIES THERE WERE ONE HUNDRED PARENTS WHO CAME TO TESTIFY ABOUT THEIR CHILDREN WHO HAD DIED NONE OF THEIR CHILDREN FOR DRUG USERS THEY NEEDED A KILL FOR SOMETHING. AND IT TURNED OUT TO BE WRONG AND THE PERSON DIED WEEKLY. PREP SO THE SOCIAL SHE SHARING- CREATES WE'LL- POTENTIAL FOR- ON. BUT THINK THAT'S WHAT GONNA. AND WE'RE ALL VERY CAN. ABOUT pLSD WHEN THE REALITY IS THAT LST COLUMNS WITH. FLASHBACKS AND- FOR THAT REPORT WE ARE WE ARE OPPOSED TO THE BILL BASED ON BOTH PROVISIONS- IN THE BILL. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER LEE.

WE'LL BRING YOU BACK TO COMMITTEE MEMBERS MISTER SAID SAID THERE ARE TWO WILL BE FIRST. AND MISS WITH THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SO ONE OF MY QUESTIONS IS IF THE SALE OF THE SUBSTANCES IS ILLEGAL HOW ARE THESE PEOPLE GOING TO COME INTO POSSESSION OF THEM WITHOUT PARTICIPATING IN AN ILLEGAL TRANSACTIONS. WHAT IT PEOPLE WILL OBTAIN- THE SUBSTANCES FRANK OF THE SAME WAY THAT THEY DO NOW IT IS BUYING A DRUG. IS NOT ILLEGAL IT'S THE POSSESSION AND USE AND THE SELLING IS A SEPARATE CRIME- SO I WANT TO BE CLEAR THIS IS NOT LIKE A GLOBAL. CHANGE EVERYTHING ON SECOND DOCSIS IS ADDRESSING ONE PIECE THAT THE POSSESSION FOR PERSONAL USE WILL NO LONGER BE CRIMINALIZING CALIFORNIA- BUT PEOPLE SOFT FIND A WAY TO GET THE DRUG. RIGHT I HAVE A LOT OF CONCERNS WITH THIS- YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH A LOT OF THE DEPRESSION DRUGS ARE OUT THAT ARE OUT THERE TO HELP PEOPLE THAT SUFFER FROM DEPRESSION CORRECT- NOT ALL OF THEM BUT YES IN GENERAL YEAH THERE'S A LOT OF. HOWEVER THERE ARE ALWAYS- ADMINISTERED UNDER THE- WELL THEY NEED TO BE ADMINISTERED. UNDER THE WATCHFUL EYES OF PHYSICIANS. BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE REACT ONE WAY TO DOES. AND SOME PEOPLE REACTED COMPLETELY DIFFERENT WAY. AND THAT OTHER WAY IS TO ACTUALLY EXACERBATE THEIR SITUATION AND THEY WIND UP COMMITTING SUICIDE- WHEN THEY WEREN'T NECESSARILY SUICIDAL SO THESE TYPE OF SECOND THESE TYPE OF CYCLE- SECOND OF PSYCHEDELIC DRUGS- ANYWAY THE ONES THAT WOULD THAT OPERATE ON YOUR PSYCHE- HAVE DIFFERENT. DIFFERENT EFFECTS ON DIFFERENT PEOPLE AND WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THOSE EFFECTS ARE SO. YOU KNOW I HAVE EVERY SYMPATHY IN THE WORLD. FOUR YOU KNOW ESPECIALLY OUR VETERANS WHO HAVE PTSD. AND I AM ALL FOR ANYTHING THAT CAN HELP THEM- TO- HELP THEM TO DEAL WITH THAT. I'M OKAY WITH HOWEVER IT HAS T BE DONE IN A CLINICAL SETTING HAS TO BE DONE NOTHING UNDER THE WATCHFUL EYE FOR. A PHYSICIAN. BECAUSE ABSENT THAT- WHAT WE'RE DOING IS OPENING THE DOOR TO A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE THE SAME ISSUES WITH DEPRESSION DRUGS. WHERE THEY CAN BE AFFECTED IN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT WAYS AND I HAVE HEARD FROM VETERANS. WHO ARE ARE SAYING THAT HEY YOU KNOW WHAT THESE DRUGS RUINED MY FRIEND'S LIFE AND HE KILLED HIMSELF. SO A. L. HOW DO YOU CONTROL THAT IF YOU'RE JUST GOING TO OPEN IT UP AND SAY HEY IF YOU JUST HAVE IT GOOD NO BIG DEAL. WELL THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION SOME EMERGED REALLY DO APPRECIATE IT AND FRANKLY THE REASON WERE IN THAT SITUATION IS BECAUSE OF THE WAR ON DRUGS. BECAUSE INSTEAD OF TAKING A RATIONAL HEALTH BASED APPROACH TO DRUGS INCLUDING PSYCHEDELICS AS WE KNEW. IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES THIS IS NOT NEW INFORMATION THERE'S A LOT MORE SIZE SEVEN THERE WAS. BUT WE KNEW IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES. I TO GOOGLE LST HEALTH BENEFITS YOU'RE GOING TO GET BY MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND HATS. WE KNEW IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES THAT THESE DRUGS COULD BE HUGELY BENEFICIAL TO PEOPLE'S HEALTH AND WELLBEING. AND IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CAME IN. AND SHUT EVERYTHING DOWN AND RESCHEDULED ALL THE DRUGS AND SAID YOU'RE A CRIMINAL IF YOU POSSESS THEM. AND SO WE HAVE LOST FIFTY YEARS IN CALIFORNIA THEN FOLLOWED SUIT LIKE WE WERE. WE WERE MASS INCARCERATION HAPPY IN THE EIGHTIES AND NINETIES AND CRIMINALIZED EVERYTHING. AND SO DIE IT'S BECAUSE OF THE WAR ON DRUGS THAT WERE IN THIS SITUATION THAT PEOPLE DON'T HAVE THE INFORMATION THEY NEED THE PEOPLE FEEL LIKE THEY NEED TO USE IT AND THE SHADOWS. WHICH MAKES IT MORE LIKELY THAT PEOPLE MIGHT USE IT IN THE WRONG DOSAGE WERE IN THE WRONG WAY I WANT TO BE CLEAR. I WOULD LOVE IT IF THE FDA ACTUALLY GOT AROUND TO RESCHEDULING- DISSIPATE. CALAMY HAS BEEN RESCHEDULED ONE OF THE REASON ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WE WERE OPEN BUT I DON'T WANT TO. BUT I HEARD PEOPLE WERE SAYING ONE OF THE REASONS WE TOOK IT OUT. IS THAT IF YOU HAVE SEVERE DEPRESSION AND KELEMETE IS ARGUABLY ONE OF THE BIGGEST BREAKTHROUGHS IN DEPRESSION TREATMENT IN A HUNDRED YEARS. YOU CAN GO TO A DOCTOR AND GETTING A FUSION ACADEMY YOU CAN'T DO THAT RIGHT NOW WITH ANY OF THESE OTHER DRUGS. IT WOULD A DOCTOR WILL LOSE HIS LICENSE. IF YOU'RE SHE TRIES TO GET THIS YEAR. AND SO I WANT THE FDA TO DO IT. I DON'T KNOW IF THE FTA WILL EVER GET AROUND TO IT OR IF IT'S GOING TO BE IN THREE OR FIVE OR SEVEN OR TEN YEARS. BUT WHAT I DO KNOW IS THAT PEOPLE ARE HURTING AND DYING NOW- I THINK WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBER OF VETERANS WHO ARE COMMITTING SUICIDE BECAUSE OF UNTREATED. MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. I MORE TO. A I'M GOING TO BE MY LIFE. THE THAT. ANYONE WHO'S COMMITTING SUICIDE. BECAUSE THEY TOOK A PSYCHEDELIC THAT IS NOT AN EPIDEMIC. THE EPIDEMIC IS UNTREATED MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTION. LIKE THE SEVEN HUNDRED PEOPLE WHO DIED LAST YEAR IN MY COMMUNITY IN SAN FRANCISCO. OF OVERDOSES. BECAUSE THEY'RE ADDICTED TO HEROIN OR FENTANYL. OUR BATH AND IT'S ILLEGAL FOR THEM TO ACCESS. THIS TREATMENT SO I HOPE THE FTA GETS AROUND TO IT. BUT YOU KNOW. IN MY COMMUNITY WERE ALSO LOSING THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES. FROM AIDS. AND IT WAS A LEGAL TO USE CANNABIS EVEN THOUGH CANNABIS COULD KEEP PEOPLE HEALTHIER. AND ALLEVIATE THEIR SYMPTOMS. AND EVEN TODAY THE NUMBER OF SENIOR CITIZENS WHO ARE USING CANNABIS. FOR THEIR ARTHRITIS. CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICANS SENIORS. WHO ARE USING CANNABIS FOR THEIR ARTHRITIS. AND THE FDA HAS NEVER RESCHEDULED OF DOCTORS CAN LOSE THEIR LICENSE. IF THEY PRESCRIBE. SO I WANT THEM TO DO THAT BUT I KNOW THAT PEOPLE ARE HURTING NOW- AND I WANT TO HELP THEM UNDERSTAND THAT AND- A. D. TELL ME. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR TAKING THAT OFF THE LIST CAN MEANS DATE RAPE. THAT'S WHY THAT IS I JUST DON'T WITH A CONSTITUENT. WHO IS IN THE SAD CIRCUMSTANCE OF HAVING THAT HAPPEN TO THEM. AND THEY COULDN'T GET THE HOSPITAL TO GIVEN THE TEST IT'LL LET THEM KNOW THAT THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED- SO TERRY. THANK YOU FOR TAKING THAT OFF THE LIST BECAUSE I WAS REALLY THAT WAS A REAL RALLY KILLER WHEN I WAS LOOKING AT THIS. AS IF THERE WEREN'T ENOUGH OF THE OTHER ONES- WHEN I TALKED THE HIGHWAY PATROL. YOU KNOW WHAT THE NUMBER IS OF HIGHWAY. INCIDENTS ARE ON THE HIGHWAYS RIGHT NOW. 70% OF THE PEOPLE THAT ARE INVOLVED IN AN INCIDENT ON THE HIGHWAY ARE UNDER SOME KIND OF INFLUENCE OF SOME KIND OF DRUG. AND SO I DON'T SEE HOW THIS HELPS THAT OUT ANY. AND ALSO UNDER DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW WE'RE GOING TO KEEP THESE. OUT OF THE HANDS OF OUR UNDER TWENTY ONE POPULATION. BECAUSE THIS WILL BE JUST LIKE BEER YOU JUST GO GET THE TWENTY ONE YEAR OLD TO GIVE YOU THE STUFF. AND EVEN THOUGH IT'S ILLEGAL THEY'RE STILL GOING TO GET IT THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE ACCESS TO IT BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO CREATE A MARKET FOR IT. SO THAT THE ILLEGAL DRUG TRADE WILL BE ABLE TO SUPPLY THEM. ALL THESE PEOPLE THAT WANT THIS BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT ALL WITH PTSD SOMEONE JUST WANT FOR RECREATIONAL USE THERE WAS A LOT OF THAT IN THE SIXTIES. AND SO I I'M NOT SURE HOW WE'RE GOING TO CONTROL ALL OF THAT. AND ON TOP OF THAT. KEEP OUR YOUNG KIDS FROM TAKING OUT ONE PILL OF ECSTASY. IT JUST HAPPENS TO BE LACED WITH FENTANYL. BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THOSE DRUG DEALERS ARE DOING THESE DAYS. IS A RELAXING EVERYTHING WITH IT AND ALL BECAUSE THEY WANT THEIR DRUG. TO HAVE AN EXTRA KICK SO THE PEOPLE CONTINUE TO BUY. SO I THINK THIS IS. ONE OF THOSE THINGS WHERE YOU'RE PUTTING THE CART BEFORE THE HORSE. I THINK IF THE FDA FINDS THAT THIS IS A DRUG. THAT IS ARE THESE DRUGS ARE BENEFICIAL FOR A CERTAIN POPULATION. THEN I THINK THAT NEEDS TO BE REGULATED. ON REGULATING IT IS NOT GOING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM. J. THAT YOU BROUGHT THE BILL- THOSE ARE MY CONCERNS I. APPRECIATE SOME EVENT I SAY ALL OF THE BAD THINGS HE'S A SAID I AGREE. DRIVING UNDER THE INFLUENCE IS BAD. GIVING DRUGS TO KIDS IS BAD. THAT IT IS ALL HAPPENING NOW. AND THAT IS IN THIS BILL DOESN'T CHANGE THAT. BUT THAT IS ALL HAPPENING NOW AND THE QUESTION IS. IF WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO SAY THAT ARRESTING PEOPLE IS GOING TO PREVENT THAT CLEARLY IT DOESN'T. COST FIFTY YEARS LATER IT'S ALL STILL HAPPENING. AND I DO JUST WANT TO SAY YOU KNOW SOMEONE WHO LOST MY AUNT TO A DRUNK DRIVER- I YOU KNOW I IF WE GOT THE DATA FROM CHP IN TERMS OF WHAT. THEY'RE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF- I'VE LEARNED ABOUT MY LUNCH AGAIN THAT IS OVERWHELMINGLY. ALCOHOL AL CAPONE OR WANNA ALCOHOL AND ALCOHOL WHICH BY THE WAY. AND WANT TO TALK ABOUT A DATE RAPE DRUG. IT'S NOT PSYCHEDELICS IS NOT CAN I MEAN. ALCOHOL MONTHS. SCARED OF ME. ALL RIGHT. WHICH WHICH THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I JUST TO THANK AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD. I THINK IT'S A VERY CRITICAL CONVERSATION WE NEED TO DECRIMINALIZE- POSSESSION OF THESE SUBSTANCES FOR PERSONAL USE- I DO BELIEVE THAT THEY- CAN OFFER THERAPEUTIC VALUE FOR PEOPLE- I AGREE WITH YOUR COMMENTS A HUNDRED PERCENT- YOU KNOW- WE FREELY DRINK ALCOHOL AND ONE COULD SAY THAT THAT'S ACTUALLY A MUCH MORE SUBSTANCE. THAN THE SUBSTANCES WERE TALKING ABOUT HERE- IN THIS BILL AND THE OTHER PIECE OF THE EQUATION HERE IS THAT WHO'S ACTUALLY GETTING ARRESTED FOR POSSESSION IT'S KIDS OF COLOR AND PEOPLE OF COLOR MORE SO THAN. WHITE FAMILIES AND WHITE KIDS AND FOLKS WHO ARE USING THIS WE HAVE TO HAVE A REAL CONVERSATION ABOUT ABOUT THIS WAR ON DRUGS. AND WHAT IT ACTUALLY MEANS AND ITS IMPACT ON PEOPLE'S LIVES- SO I WILL MOVE THE BILL HASN'T MOVED ALREADY I WILL SUPPORT THE BILL AND I LOVE TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. MISTER LUCKY. YES SIR I'M NOT GOING TO BE LABOR THE POINTS. OF OBJECTION THAT I HAVE TO THIS PARTICULAR MEASURE I KNOW THAT YOUR- YOUR INTENTIONS. ARE SURPRISINGLY NORMAL- BUT I REALLY REALLY. TAKEN OBJECTION. BECAUSE I'VE SEEN THE HURTFUL IMPACTS OF. WHAT THESE PARTICULAR DRUGS- AND THEY ARE VERY VERY HURTFUL NUMBER THREATENING IN MANY WAYS TO THE INDIVIDUALS THEMSELVES AND MAYBE EVEN OTHERS AND I THINK BY- LEGALIZING THE SUBSTANCE THOSE TRAGEDIES ARE GOING TO INCREASE OLD THAT'S REALLY WHERE I'M COMING FROM AND I THINK YOU KNOW THAT SO I'M NOT GOING TO BE INSULTING OR- OR BE NASTY OTHERS. WILL TELL YOU THAT I THINK IT IT'S MISGUIDED BECAUSE I'VE SEEN THE OTHER SIDE OF THESE DRUGS AND IT'S VERY VERY. HEARTBREAKING THAT'S ALL I GOT. THANK YOU MR CLARK- SO I'M ALREADY A CO AUTHOR THANK YOU- LOOK AS HE AS SO ELOQUENTLY STATED BY THE AUTHOR WARRANT DRUGS HASN'T WORKED. BY MAKING THESE THINGS TOTALLY LEGAL IT'S MUCH EASIER THE PEOPLE WHO ARE SELLING THEM TO SELL THEM TO MINORS- WE OUGHT TO BE LEGALIZING POSSESSION PERIOD- HOW DOES IT HELP PEOPLE TO BE ARRESTED PARTICULARLY WHEN IT'S PREDOMINANTLY BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE WHO ARE- DISADVANTAGED BY THIS YOU KNOW WHEN I WENT TO SCHOOL AT COLUMBIA- ALL THE KIDS TO TRIED LSD AND- CANNABIS AT CETERA. NO ONE WAS EVER ARRESTED FOR ANYTHING AND- YOU KNOW A HALF MILE AWAY IN HARLEM BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE WERE BEING ARRESTED ALL THE TIME WE HAVE TO STOP THIS THANK YOU. THANK YOU ARE ANYMORE FOR COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. YOU MAY CLOSE. I THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN AGAIN YOU WERE HERE EARLIER I JUST WANT TO EXPRESS MY THANKS TO YOU AND TO THE COMMITTEE FOR WORKING WITH US- FOR PRAYER VERY THOROUGH ANALYSIS ON MY REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES TO BOTH OF YOU I KNOW- WE ALL COME FROM A GOOD PLACE ON THIS AND I APPRECIATE YOU ALL ARE VERY OPEN AND CANDID AND I UNDERSTAND WE HAVE A DISAGREEMENT ON THIS AND I HONOR THAT DISAGREEMENT. ABOUT COLLEAGUES I THINK THIS IS A BILL THAT IS LONG OVERDUE- AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. AND I WANT TO THANK YOU TO FOR A TICKING COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS ESPECIALLY IN OF JOIN. ME TO SEROTONIN PICKING UP. KIDDING ME IT. DID I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO THAT WOULD. JUST COME. VIEWS WHAT YOU ULTIMATELY WANT TO GET ACCOMPLISHED. I WITH THEIR TEACHERS RECOMMENDED I CALL THE ROLL. THE BILL'S IMPROPERLY MENTIONS ON SB FIVE NINETEEN BY SENATOR WIENER THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO THE HEALTH COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER HI GENSER HI LACKEY. LACKEY NO BARRICADE HAD. LEE LEE HIGH COURT HI CORK HI SANTIAGO SANTIAGO I SEE YOUR TO KNOW THEY ARE TURNOUT WICKS. MEASURES ARE CALLED ONE MORE THING YOU VERY MUCH COLOR MUCH OF. THANK YOU. I WAS SKIN. ITEMS NUMBER THIRTEEN. BILL NUMBER SB SIXTEEN ITEM NUMBER FOURTEEN S. B. EIGHTY ONE AND ICE MY UNDERSTANDING. YOU WOULD LIKE TO START WITH S. B. EIGHT ONE. YES BECAUSE MY WITNESSES THAT. TIME HAS TIME CONSTRAINTS. I HAD THE- OR HALF A GREAT HONOR TO SERVE ON THE COMMITTEE ON THE REVIEW OF THE PENAL CODE WHICH WAS ESTABLISHED FIRST CONCEPTUALLY BY GOVERNOR BROWN BUT THEN THE APPOINTMENTS WERE MADE BY GOVERNOR NEWSOM AND I SERVE ON ACT WITH A DEAN OF A LAW SCHOOL TO OF ONE OF OUR JUSTICES ARE SUPERIOR COURT JUSTICES IN ART ONE OF OUR JUDGES- AND- THE ACADEMIC FROM STANFORD. WHO FOCUSES ON CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND WHAT WE HAVE BEEN DOING IS TAKE HAVING X. VERY LONG MEETINGS WITH STAKEHOLDER INPUT ABOUT VARIOUS PARTS OF THE PENAL CODE. AND WE'VE HAD A NUMBER OF SESSIONS ON THE CONCEPT OF ENHANCEMENTS. AND AS YOU KNOW WHAT AN ENHANCEMENT IS A SENSE IN HANTS MEANT IS THAT IT ADDS TIME TO THE BASE SENTENCE OF THE FACE CRIME. AND INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH MOST PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THIS CALIFORNIA HAS ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SIXTY ON THE BOOKS- MY APPROACH WITH SB EIGHTY ONE WHICH WAS DEVELOPED BY. THE JUDGE AND THE JUSTICE ON OUR PENAL CODE COMMITTEE. WAS TO PROVIDE JUDICIAL GUIDANCE BECAUSE BOTH OF THESE- PEOPLE THAT SERVE ON THE BENCH. POINTED OUT THAT WHILE THERE IS SOME DISCRETION IT THEY ARE VERY IT'S UNCLEAR UNDER WHAT CONTEXT MAY DAY EXERT THAT DISCRETION IN RELATIONSHIP TO THE SENTENCE ENHANCEMENTS AND WE EVEN HAD DE ACE TESTIFIED THAT THE MAJORITY OF THE TRIAL ENDS UP BEING A DISCUSSION ON THE ENHANCEMENTS RATHER THAN ON THE CRIME ITSELF. SO WHAT SB EIGHTY ONE DOES IS PROVIDES GUIDANCE TO OUR JUDGES SO THEY HAVE SOME CRITERIA TO USE WHEN THEY ARE DETERMINING AT THE SENTENCING HANDSOMEST AT THE AT. SO IT PROVIDES THIS CLEAR GUIDANCE AND- THE COMMITTEE AND I FEEL THAT THIS WILL IMPROVE FAIRNESS IN SENTENCING AND ENSURE THAT THE PENALTY REFLECTS THE TRUE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CRIME- I WOULD LIKE MY WITNESSES NOW TO- PRESENT AND THEY ARE JUDGE PETER ESPINOZA ONE OF THE MEMBERS OF THE PENAL CODE REVIEW COMMITTEE WHO HELPED TO DEVELOP THIS POLICY. AND PROFESSOR MICHAEL ROMANO FROM STANFORD WHO IS THE CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE ON REVISION OF THE PENAL CODE. YOU MAY OPEN UP LINES AT T. OPERATORS FOR. PROFESSOR ROMERO OVER FOR- PETER ESPINOZA FORMER JUDGE. CERTAINLY THANK YOU TO BOTH OF THEIR LINES ARE OPEN TO SPEAK AT THEIR DISCRETION. THE ROMANO WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO FOR WHAT YOU WANT TO GO. ALL SURE I'LL GO FIRST- MY NAME IS MICHAEL MONO I TEACH AT STANFORD LAW SCHOOL THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME- I AM THE CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE ON THE REVISION OF THE PENAL CODE AND I HAVE THE GREAT PLEASURE OF SERVING LYNCH- SENATOR SKINNER. AND JUDGE ESPINOZA AMONG OTHERS- I JUST WANNA MAKE A FEW QUICK POINTS OF SUPPORT OF SB EIGHTY ONE- WE HAVE A AS A COMMITTEE LAST YEAR HAD OVER- FIFTY HOURS A PUBLIC HEARINGS WE HEARD FROM FIFTY SIX EXPERT WITNESSES INCLUDING LAW ENFORCEMENT VICTIMS ADVOCATE CHILL RIGHTS LEADERS THE PEOPLE DIRECTLY IMPACTED BY PUBLIC LEGAL SYSTEM. WE ALSO RECEIVED EXTENSIVE PUBLIC COMMENT IN ALMOST EVERY- SESSION THAT WE HAD THAT ONE WAVERLY ANOTHER WISH- SHOULDN'T SHOULD HANDS NEXT. WHICH AS THE COMMITTEE CERTAINLY KNOWS RESULT EXTREMELY LENGTHY SENTENCES- OF COURSE THERE OFTEN DISPROPORTIONATELY APPLIED AGAINST PEOPLE OF COLOR AND RESEARCH SHOWS THAT THEY HAVE LITTLE OR NO IMPACT ON PUBLIC SAFETY- TRIFECTA SPECIFICALLY TO SB EIGHTY ONE- DID MANAGE PENAL CODE- THIRTEEN EIGHTY FIVE. WHICH ALLOWS JUDGES TO DISMISS CERTAIN ENHANCEMENTS QUOTE IN FURTHERANCE OF JUSTICE. UNFORTUNATELY THERE IS NO STATUTORY DEFINITION OF WHAT THAT PHRASE MEANS AND THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT HAS SAID IS THAT IS A QUOTE AMORPHOUS CONCEPT. ON QUOTE AND AS. A RESULT- IT DIDN'T UTILIZE IN- IN IN A COULD JUST AND ARE. WELL PERHAPS NOT ARCHER ANYTHING. AND YOU CAN JUST ARE THE STATE. OF CALIFORNIA. HAD SOME LIMITS OF MULTIPLE KANSEN BUT LEGISLATURE PROPOSAL AWAY IN NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN- WE BELIEVE THAT SB EIGHTY ONE IS A GOOD WAY TO- INFORM JUDICIAL DISCRETION. BUT STILL PRESERVES AND PRIORITIZES- THE ABILITY TO JUDGE TO- IMPOSE SENTENCES TO PROTECT PUBLIC SAFETY. WE ALSO HELP TO HELP MINIMIZE. SOME OF THE- UNINTENDED. OF IT AND- THE LAST THAT WE WILL SAY THAT AMONG OUR WITNESSES WORK FORMER GOVERNOR JERRY BROWN WHO TOLD THE COMMITTEE QUOTE WE SHOULD GET RID OF ALL THE ENHANCEMENTS. SANTA CLARA DISTRICT ATTORNEY JEFF ROSEN SAID ENHANCEMENTS HAVE BECOME THE TAIL THAT WAGS THE DOG QUOTE- AND TRIALS AND LOS ANGELES DISTRICT ATTORNEY GEORGE GASC ON WHO I TESTIFIED THAT ENHANCEMENTS RESULT IN EXCESSIVE SENTENCES AND HAVE NO CONNECTION TO PUBLIC SAFETY- SO WITH THAT I'LL HAND THE CALL OVER TO MY COMMITTEE MEMBER- PETER ESPINOZA AND OF COURSE ANSWER. ANY QUESTIONS IF THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL. THANK YOU MICHAEL MY MR AUSTIN ALL SUMMER WITH JUDGE OF A LOS ANGELES SUPERIOR COURT JUDGE OF THE PERSONAL. WHEN YOU. CONSIDER S. B. EIGHTY ONE HUNDRED AND SENATOR SKINNER HAS REFERRED TO THE FACT THAT YOU'RE ALREADY OVER ONE HUNDRED FIFTY ENHANCEMENTS IN ALBANY CALIFORNIA PENAL CODE A CANADIAN SCHOOL IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX OVER 80% OF PEOPLE IN PRISON ARE SERVING THE TERM ONCE AND B ENHANCEMENTS AND MORE THAN 25% OF PEOPLE IN PRISON ARE SERVING SENTENCES EXTENDED BY THREE OR MORE ENHANCEMENTS. WHEN THE COMMISSION PENAL CODE- YOUR VISION WAS PUT TOGETHER ONE OF THE THINGS WE ARE ASKED TO DO AS NON CONSIDER HOW THE PENAL CODE CONTRIBUTES TO RACIAL DISPARITIES WITHIN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM LOOKING AT THE PENAL CODE AND ENHANCEMENTS THROUGH A RACIAL JUSTICE. ON RACIAL EQUITY LANDS. PORTANTINO THAT 9% OF IN PRISON WITH A GANG. OF PEOPLE OF COLOR. AND GUN ENHANCEMENT ARE PEOPLE OF COLOR. AND I JUST WANT TO REINFORCE- PROFESSOR LEMANIS- SORT OF OVERVIEW OF WHAT THE DISK THIS BILL DOES AND DOESN'T DO IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT THIS BILL DOES NOT ELIMINATE. ANY ENHANCEMENTS FROM JUDGES TO NOT LOSE THE ABILITY TO IMPOSE ENHANCEMENTS- THE GOAL IS TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE AS TO WHEN JUDGES SHOULD THIS MESS BY SCAVENGING THE PRESUMPTION THAT THEY DO STONE CIRCUMSTANCES. BUT THIS SHOULD ONLY BE DONE ALWAYS BEGUN CONSIDERATION OF PUBLIC SAFETY- AND THE JUDGE HAS THE ABILITY TO IMPOSE- ENHANCEMENT DEPOSITION PORTENTS TO PROTECTING PUBLIC SAFETY. CALIFORNIA PREVIOUSLY HAD A LIMITATION ON STACKING MULTIPLE ENHANCEMENTS THAT WAS ELIMINATED IN NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN THANK YOU. VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. NOW GOING TO THE ROOM ARE WOULD SINCE.

BEEN A LONG LONG DAY ROBERT MESSED MESSED MEANT FROM THE ORANGE COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE. BY PHONE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR ADA ROBERT MASS MEN ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY BEFORE THE COMMITTEE- I'D LIKE TO NOTE THAT- MOST ENHANCEMENTS ARE WHAT ARE KNOWN AS SPECIFIC OR CONDUCT MASON HARASSMENTS THEY ARE DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE CONDUCT AN INDIVIDUAL ENGAGES IN DURING A CRIME. A DEFENDANT SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR ENGAGING AND AGGRAVATED CONDUCT DURING THE COMMISSION OF A CRIME INCLUDING FOR USE OF A WEAPON OR FIREARM INJURY TO A VICTIM OR MULTIPLE VICTIMS AND COMMITTING A HATE CRIME. I READ ONE OF THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS THAT QUOTE PHILIPSBURG COMMITTEE IN THE SAME CRIME SOME INDIVIDUALS RECEIVE ONLY THE FACE SENTENCE WHILE OTHERS HAVE FIVE TEN OR MORE YEARS ADDED TO THEIR TIME UNQUOTE. THAT IS AN INACCURATE STATEMENT IT IS NOT THE SAME CRIME A ROBBERY COMMITTED WITH THE USE OF A WEAPON OR FIREARM FOR WHERE THE VICTIM IS INJURED IS DIFFERENT THAN JUST A REGULAR ROBBERY THOUGH THE BASE CHARGE PENAL. CODE SECTION TWO ELEVN IS THE SAME. TD IS OPPOSED S. EIGHTY ONE FOREVER OF REASONS. FIRST THE BILL IS UNNECESSARY UNDER EXISTING LAW JUDGES HAVE DISCRETION AND FLEXIBILITY DETERMINING WHETHER TO IMPOSE OR DISMISS AN ENHANCEMENT THIS BILL ACTUALLY TAKE DISCRETION AWAY FROM JUDGES ARE IN THE BEST POSITION TO EVALUATE THE FACTS OF THE CASE AND THE PARTICULARS OF THE OFFENDER. THERE ARE MULTIPLE STATUTES RULES OF COURT AND CASE LAW THAT GOVERN HOW COURTS ARE CONDUCTED SENSING SENSING HEARING WHT FACTORS TO CONSIDER AND WHETHER TO IMPOSE OR DISMISS AN ENHANCEMENT. I JUDGES IN THE BEST POSITION TO DETERMINE AN APPROPRIATE SENTENCE AND WHAT IS IN THE INTEREST OF JUSTICE TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE TOTALITY OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES. INSTEAD OF SIMPLY LISTING ADDITIONAL CRITERIA FOR THE COURT TO CONSIDER AND PROVIDING GUIDANCE AS THE COMMITTEE ON THE REVISION OF THE PENAL CODE SUGGESTS. WHICH WOULD ACTUALLY ADDRESS A MAJOR CONCERN OF THE PARK BILL'S PROPONENTS CONCERNING LACK OF CLARITY AND CONSISTENCY SB EIGHTY ONE ACTUALLY TIES THE HANDS OF JUDGES. THE BILL WILL ESSENTIALLY PROHIBIT ENHANCEMENTS IN MULTIPLE CIRCUMSTANCES BY CREATING A MANDATORY PRESUMPTION. WITH AN UNREALISTICALLY HIGH BURDEN OF PROOF CLEAR AND CONVINCING EVIDENCE OF RISK TO PUBLIC SAFETY. THAT MEANS A JUDGE COULD DETERMINE THAT IT'S MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT DISMISSAL OF ENHANCEMENT WOULD ENDANGER PUBLIC SAFETY BUT STILL BE REQUIRED TO DISMISS IT LET ME REPEAT THAT A JUDGE COULD DETERMINE THAT IT'S MORE LIKELY THAN NOT. THAT DISMISSAL ENHANCEMENT WOULD ENDANGER PUBLIC SAFETY BUT STILL BE REQUIRED TO DISMISS IT. THAT MAKES NO SENSE THAT'S WHAT THIS HIGH BURDEN OF PROOF. CLEAR CONVINCING EVIDENCE WOULD DO. AND UNLIKE THE REST THE PENAL CODE SECTION THIRTEEN EIGHTY FIVE THAT ALLOWS THE JUDGE TO STRIKE IT THE ADDITIONAL PUNISHMENT SB EIGHTY ONE PROVIDES NO SUCH DISCRETION FOR THE COURT. A JUDGE MUST DISMISS THE ENHANCEMENT IN ITS ENTIRETY IF THE MAIN CONCERN OF THE AUTHOR AND SPONSORS OF THE OF THE BILL IS THE ADDITIONAL PUNISHMENT ASSOCIATED WITH ENHANCEMENTS THAT AT A MINIMUM. THIS ASPECT OF THE BILL SHOULD BE AMENDED TO ALLOW STRIKING JUST THE PUNISHMENT UNDER THIRTEEN EIGHTY FIVE SUBSECTION B. THERE ARE ALSO NO EXCLUSIONS BILL. THE BILL WILL APPLY TO SERIOUS AND VIOLENT OFFENSES INCLUDING MURDER RAPE CHILD MOLESTATION DOMESTIC VIOLENCE HUMAN TRAFFICKING HATE CRIMES EXCEPT YOUR- FINALLY MANY OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES LISTED IN SB EIGHTY ONE THAT PRESUME THAT ENHANCE COULD BE DISMISSED HER TROUBLING INCLUDING MULTIPLE ENHANCEMENTS IF A DEFENDANT ENGAGES IN VARIOUS CONTACT THAT RESULTS IN MULTIPLE ENHANCEMENTS. SUCH AS USE OF A WALK. OF SEVERAL WEAPONS OR INFLICTION OF SERIOUS INJURY MULTIPLE VICTIMS HAD MULTIPLE ENHANCEMENTS MAY BE WARRANTED. ANOTHER CRITERIA THAT THE OFFENSES CONNECTED TO PRIOR VICTIMIZATION OF CHILDHOOD TRAUMA UNLIKE TO. THE PROVISION CONCERNING MENTAL ILLNESS IT IS UNCLEAR WHAT THE TERM CONNECTED MEANS AND THE DEFINITION OF PRIOR VICTIMIZATION IN CHILDHOOD TRAUMA IS SIMPLY TOO BROAD INCLUDING EVEN CHILDHOOD TRAUMA EXPERIENCED BY A HOUSEHOLD MEMBER. IN OTHER WORDS I DEFENDED WHO NEVER EXPERIENCED CHILDHOOD TRAUMA WOULD QUALIFY UNDER THIS PROVISION. ALSO CONVICTION UP PRIOR CONVICTIONS THAT ARE FIVE OR MORE YEARS OLD THIS MEANS THAT A SIX YEAR OLD PRIOR RAPE CONVICT CONVICTION OF A SERIAL RAPIST SHOULD BE DISREGARDED WHAT IF THE INDIVIDUAL HAD BEEN CURSORY DID OVER MOST OF THAT PERIOD. OR THE INDIVIDUAL IS RE OFFENDED MULTIPLE TIMES OVER THAT PERIOD THESE FACTORS ARE NOT CONSIDERED UNDER THE BILL. FINALLY I JUST WANT TO TALK ABOUT- ONE CASE THAT SHOWS AN EXAMPLE OF SENTENCING ENHANCEMENTS AND THAT'S THE RECENT CASE OF EIGHT AND LEO'S SIX YEAR OLD BOY WHO WAS TRAGICALLY KILLED IN A ROAD RAGE SHOOTING ON THE FIFTY FIVE FREEWAY. WITHOUT THE ENHANCEMENT FOR INTENTIONAL DISCHARGE OF A FIREARM RESULTED IN DEATH THE DEFENDANT WOULD BE RELEASED POLICE. TO SAN. SHOOTING INTO AN OCCUPIED VEHICLE HE WOULD BE RELEASED UNDER FIVE YEARS VOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER RELEASED UNDER EIGHT YEARS AND EVEN IF HE WAS CONVICTED OF SECOND DEGREE MURDER HE'D BE ELIGIBLE FOR PAROLE UNDER TEN YEARS. THAT'S SIMPLY NOT ENOUGH TIME FOR THE SENSELESS KILLING OF A SIX YEAR OLD BOY. CDA WOULD BE MORE THAN WILLING TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR AND OTHER SPONSORS OF THE BILL ON ON THE LANGUAGE OF THE BILL. BUT ADDED KERR IS CURRENTLY DRAFTED WE MUST BE OPPOSED TO SB EIGHTY ONE AND ASK YOU TO. OPPOSE IT WITH A NO VOTE THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. NORTH SORRY THERE'S NO OTHER.

PALS FORTIES UPLAND INGLEWOOD CORONA NEWPORT BEACH SANTA ANA. ARCADIA POMONA BURBANK RIVERSIDE CULVER CITY. ALL IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL THANK YOU THANK YOU NOW WILL BRING BACK MR LACKEY I THINK YOU BEGIN FIRST. OKAY WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND CENTER WITH ALL DUE RESPECT I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT I'M I'M VERY MUCH IN OPPOSITION TO THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL TO YOU BROUGHT FORWARD HERE I THINK IT GOES WAY BEYOND GUIDANCE AND IT'S MY OPINION THAT IT'S EXTREMELY BIASED. AND IT'S APPROACH AND- YOU MENTIONED EARLIER THIS TO YOUR GOAL WAS FAIRNESS. BUT IN MY OPINION OF FAIRNESS SHOULD NOT BE DEFINED BY JUST A REDUCED SENTENCE. I HAVE HERE. A BOOK THIS BOOK IS SOLELY CRIMINAL SENTENCING ENHANCEMENTS AND YOU YOUR BILL WILL ESSENTIALLY MAKE ITS CONTENTS OBSOLETE. BECAUSE YOU YOUR BILL IN ITS CURRENT FORM. DESTROYS JUDICIAL DISCRETION AS IT RELATES TO- SENATE'S ANNOUNCEMENTS. AND SO I WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SUPPORT IT. AND I'D I'M SORRY THAT- THAT'S MY POSITION BUT IT IS A VERY STRONG POSITION. THANK YOU. MISTER LEE. I THANK CENTER FOR BRING US FOR IT'S A GREAT PLEASURE TO BE SERVING ON THE COMMITTEE COMMITTEE ON THE REVISION OF THE PENAL CODE WITH YOU AS WELL AFTER OF PLACING NOW CENTER COLLAR ON IT BUT IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT I THINK WITH SUPPORT AT THIS BILL I THINK IT'S MISCONSTRUED AS THE IT'S CLARIFYING. OF THE ABILITY TO FOURTEEN JUSTICES TO DISMISS ENHANCEMENT IN THE FURTHERANCE OF JUSTICE AND THAT'S THE KEY PHRASE IN THE FURTHERANCE OF JUSTICE IF THAT PHRASE SOUNDS VAGUE TO YOU RIGHT NOW THAT OF COURSE IMAGINE IT AT THE COURT LEVEL AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO WITH THIS BILL AND I SEE IT'S ALSO PERSPECTIVE SO DOESN'T YOU RETRACTABLE THAT PEOPLE- SOME OF THE- OPPONENTS. KIND OF. MESSAGE ABOUT. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT AND YOU KNOW AS THE EVEN THAT. DISTRICT ATTORNEY OF MINE COUNTY HAD. TALKED ABOUT. AND THE COUNTIES CLARA. SANTA TAXES-REALLY HAVE BECOME THE TAIL THAT WAGS THE DOG IN MANY CASES AS- I ALSO PRESENTED A BILL BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE ANNOUNCEMENTS. THE PEOPLE SERVE A LONGER SENTENCE FOR. ADULTS FOR MANDATORY ADD ON'S AND THEY DO FOR THE PRINCIPLE CRIMES AND IF OUR SYSTEM IS ABOUT. EDUCATING THE- NUANCES OF A CRIME OR EDUCATING WHAT A DETAILS ARE ABOUT IT SHOULD BE- THE CRITICAL JUST ASSUME SHOULD BE HINGED. ON JUST THAT GIANT BOOK OF A HUNDRED SIXTY ENHANCEMENTS SO. I THINK THIS IS A VERY CLEAR. AND SIMPLE BILL ABOUT IT THAT IT'S WHICH HAS WRAPPED UP A LOT OF MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT IT. AND IF THERE IS A TIME TO BE AT HONEST CO AUTHOR OF LOVE TO JOIN YOU AS WELL CENTER SKINNER. THANK YOU. MR CLARK- YES I SUPPOSE THIS BILL AS WELL HASN'T BEEN MOVED YET. NOW I'LL MOVE THE BELL- AND I'M VERY GLAD THAT- ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEE IS ON THIS COMMITTEE AND THAT HE HAS TAKEN TO THIS COMMITTEE LIKE A DUCK TO WATER AND IT'S VERY VERY GLAD TO HAVE HIM ON HERE- LOOK THE POINT OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IS TO MAKE LIFE SAFER FOR ALL OF US. I DON'T THINK PUTTING AWAY A PERSON FOR TWENTY YEARS INSTEAD OF TEN MAKES MY LIFE SAFER. FRANKLY THE SOONER SOMEONE CAN GET A GET OUT THE MORE LIKELY THEY ARE TO BE RETURNED TO- NORMAL LIFE IS SUPPOSED TO A LIFE OF CRIME SO I JUST DON'T SEE THE POINT OF THESE LONG ANNOUNCEMENTS. THIS RESEARCH SAYS THAT THEY DO NOT DETER PEOPLE FROM. COMMITTING CRIMES SO I'M VERY MUCH IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER SEA OTTER THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER CORK THE POINT OF. OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IS ACTUALLY TO PROVIDE JUSTICE TO VICTIMS A LOT OF TIMES- IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT- THAT JUST SENTENCE- WE JUST HAD A RECENT COURT CARTER RECENT CASE THAT WAS WAS SETTLED- WELL PUBLICIZED. IT HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF MUCH ANGST OVER THE LAST YEAR. AND THAT IS THE TRIAL OF- DEAR CHILDREN. AND DEREK SHERMAN WOULD HAVE HAD A TWELVE YEAR SENTENCE HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR ENHANCEMENTS. I DON'T THINK A TWELVE YEAR SENTENCE WOULD HAVE- APPROPRIATELY ADDRESSED THE OUTRAGE AND CONCERNS OVER HIS CONDUCT- OR THE OUTCOME OF THAT CONTACT. AND IF YOU THAT WERE IN CALIFORNIA THAT'S WHAT HE WOULD GET. AND ACCORDING TO THIS. AND I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT'S IN THE BEST INTEREST OF JUSTICE- I THINK WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THAT AND HE SENATE'S ENHANCEMENTS. ARE KIND OF IN LIEU OF- TRYING THEM ON EACH EACH DIFFERENT COUNT OF WHICH WERE BLACK HAIR BAND. USED TO DOING. AND THAT'S THE JUDICATA BY THE JUDGE AT THE END AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED IN THAT TRIAL. HISENSE'S TWELVE YEARS. AND ENDED THE JUDGES ABLE TO ADD ON SENTENCING ENHANCEMENTS FOR OPERATING OF THE COLOR OF AUTHORITY OR MISUSING HIS AUTHORITY. AND AND THEN BUT I FORGOT WHAT THE OTHER ONE WAS. THE ADDED TEN YEARS AND TWENTY TWO AND A HALF YEARS SEEMS MORE LIKE A JUST SENTENCE. TEN TWELVE. IF YOU'RE OUT IN EIGHT. BECAUSE IF YOU DO GOOD TIME. GOING OUT NAY. I WOULD OFFERED AND I DOUBT VERY MUCH THAT MR CHAU VAN WOULD DO ANYTHING TO ANYBODY IF WE RELATE. IS NOT IN JAIL FOR THAT IS NOT IN JAIL BECAUSE WERE AFRAID HE'S GOING TO DO SOMETHING TO SOMEBODY ELSE IS IN JAIL BECAUSE WHAT HE DID. AND THAT'S WHAT I SEE AS THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM WORKING CORRECTLY. AND WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT IT CONTINUES TO WORK CORRECTLY IN THE FUTURE I DON'T THINK THIS HELPS. SO UNFORTUNATELY TODAY ON THIS BILL I CANNOT SUPPORT YOU KNOW THANK YOU. THANK YOU I NEED A FEW MORE COMMON FOR. YOU MAY CLOSE I'M THANK YOU CHAIR- WE OBVIOUSLY HAVE MANY BILLS REGARDING ENHANCEMENTS THAT COME BEFORE US AND- THE END THERE ARE MERITS TO ALL OF THEM THE APPROACH AS THE WITNESSES WHO TESTIFIED IN SUPPORT. EXPLAINED THAT WE ARE TRYING TO TAKE IN THIS ONE IS RATHER THAN ELIMINATING THE ENHANCEMENTS. BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY ONE COULD MAKE A GOOD ARGUMENT HE PER CLIENT FOR ANYONE OF THE HUNDRED AND SIXTY. IT WAS TO BE ABLE TO. PROVIDE GUIDANCE TO THE JUDGE NOW OBVIOUSLY THE DA'S ASSOCIATION BILLS IT TIES THEIR HANDS HOWEVER WE DID HEAR FROM JUDGE ESPINOZA WHO ALONG WITH JUSTICE CARLOS MORENO JUSTICE CARLOS MORENO WAS FORMER CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT JUSTICE. BOTH TO SERVE ON THE COMMITTEE AND BOTH TO HELP TO DRAFT THIS THEY FELT THAT THIS WAS THE APPROPRIATE WAY TO GO FOR JUDGES. AND WHEN WE LOOKED AT ENHANCEMENTS THIS WAS THE KEY RECOMMENDATIONS THAT THE COMMITTEE MADE VERSUS MANY OTHERS THAT WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CONTEMPLATE. AND THEY BELIEVE THAT IT DID STILL PROVIDE DISCRETION TO THE JUDGE- BECAUSE IN THE IF I WANT TO USE THE DIRECTOR OF AN EXAMPLE AND IT'S HARD BECAUSE I'M NOT THE JUDGE IN THAT CASE NOR WAS I THE JURY SO I CAN'T I CAN ONLY PURPORT. TO SAY WHAT I THINK EITHER HIS CHARACTER IS OR HIS MOTIVATION HOWEVER. THAT JUDGE. MAY DETERMINATION RIGHT SO IN IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES WITH THIS BILL IF THE JUDGE IN SUCH A CIRCUMSTANCE FELT THAT IT WAS THE FURTHERANCE OF PUBLIC SAFETY TO ADD ENHANCEMENTS TO THE SENTENCE OF SOMEONE LIKE MR CHILDREN HE WOULD BE ABLE TO- SO THAT'S REALLY THE PURPOSE OF THE BILL AND- WHAT I WOULD NOTE IS THAT. THE DA ASSOCIATION IS OPPOSED TO EVERY ENHANCEMENT BILL THAT IS ON THAT IS BEING PROPOSED THIS YEAR AND HAS BEEN IN THE PAST- I WOULD WELCOME SOME CONSTRUCTIVE SUGGESTIONS HOWEVER AND I'M NOT LOOKING. THEY HAVE A CERTAIN ROLE- SO WHAT THEY ARE YOU KNOW. WHETHER THEY WOULD CONSTRUCT SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENTLY OR EVEN ENTERTAINED SOMETHING DIFFERENT THIS I CAN'T REALLY SAY HOWEVER IT IS BEEN MY EXPERIENCE HAVING BEEN CHAIR OF PUBLIC SAFETY FOR FOUR YEARS IN THE SENATE. AND SERVED ON IT FOR MANY MANY MORE YEARS IT IS NOT EVER BEEN THERE'S NOT BEEN A SINGLE. BILL REGARDING ANY ASPECT OF ENHANCEMENTS MEANING TO EITHER- AB PUT GUARDRAILS ON THEM ELIMINATE THEM OR OTHERWISE THAT I'VE SEEN THE DA ASSOCIATION SUPPORT- AGAIN THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY- INDICATE THE MERIT OR NON MERIT OF THEIR ARGUMENT ANYONE CASE I JUST MEAN THAT IT IS. IT WOULD BE MORE HELPFUL FOR MANY OF US IF WE HAD KEPT THE CONSTRUCTIVE SUGGESTIONS- BUT I THINK THE BILL IS SOUND AND AS I INDICATED I ACCEPT THE COMMITTEES MMS. AND I WOULD ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. IT THANK YOU AND- THE DISHES THIS IS INTERESTING I USED TO BE ABLE TO SAY. THAT I'M PROBABLY THE LONGEST SERVING MEMBER IN THE LEGISLATURE DAN DID I SEE YOU. AND I HAVE TO STAND CORRECTED SOMEONE WHO SERVED WITH YOU IN THE ASSEMBLY ON THIS COMMITTEE YES- WE REMEMBER BACK WHEN I KNOW WHEN I CAME IN TWENTY TWELVE. WE'RE VERY SUSPICIOUS OF JUDGES BECAUSE THEY HAD BEEN TO THREE STRIKES MANDATORY MINIMUMS AND THAT'S WHAT THEY GAVE UP THEY GAVE IT OUT LIKE CANDY AND POPCORN JUST JUST GIVING IT AND WE DID TRUST. JUDGES HAVE DISCRETION. I THINK WE WERE VERY HARD. TO KIND OF CHANGE THE ATTITUDE IN THE MAKE UP OF JUDICIAL SYSTEM. TO PROVE THAT LOOK WHERE WE ARE NOW YOU'RE- YOU'RE TRYING TO GIVE JUDGES MORE DISCRETION. SO THAT THEY CAN MAKE MORE INFORMED DECISIONS ABOUT WHAT TO DO. AND AS I READ HERE THE BILL. HAS WHAT IT SAYS THIS BILL WOULD EXCEPT AS SPECIFIED. REQUIRE COURT DISMISSED AN ENHANCEMENT IF. IT IS IN THE FURTHERANCE OF JUSTICE TO DO SO. THE BILL WOULD CREATE A PRESUMPTION THAT IS IT IS IT IS IN THE FURTHERANCE OF JUSTICE TO DISMISS AN ENHANCEMENT IS SPECIFIED CIRCUMSTANCES. THE BILL WITH STATE. THAT THIS PRESUMPTION IS ONLY OVERCOME UPON A SHOWING BY CLEAR. AND CONVINCING EVIDENCE THAT DISMISSAL OF THE ENHANCEMENT WOULD ENDANGER PUBLIC SAFETY SO IT'S NOT AN AUTOMATIC IS NOT IT YOU HAVE TO YOU HAVE TO HAVE BECAUSE IN REASON AND FOR THAT REASON I'M SUPPORTING THE BILL- I THINK IT DEMONSTRATES WHERE WE ARE TODAY. AND THE FACT THAT OTHERS DO NOT WANT TO GIVE JUDGES WERE AFRAID TO GIVE JUDGES DISCRETION- SHOWS YOU HOW SUCCESSFUL WE'VE BEEN. OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME TO TRY TO CHANGE THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AT THE JUDICIAL LEVEL AND WE JUST STILL HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO WITH THE REST OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. SO THE JUDGE RECOMMENDED I BOOKED. THE BILL'S BEEN PROPERLY MOVED AND SECONDED ON SB EIGHTY ONE BY SENATOR SKINNER THE MISSION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER. HI GENSER AYE LACKEY. LACKEY NOW BARRICADE HAN. LI LI I WORK OUR- WORK I SANTIAGO. C. A. R. TO KNOW THEY ARE TO A NO WICKS FIVE WEEKS I. IT MEASURES ARE CALLED NEEDS ONE MORE HERE MAY NOW TAKE UP SB SIXTEEN PEACE OFFICERS RELEASE OF RECORDS ABOUT THE BILL SECOND. THANK YOU AND I WILL NOT PROLONG THE DISCUSSION SINCE THIS IS PRETTY MUCH THE IDENTICAL BILL THAT WENT OFF YOUR FLOOR WITH FIFTY FOUR VOTES- LAST SESSION BUT ON ITS WAY TO THE SENATE BECAUSE OF THE TIME DEADLINE. IT WAS WE WERE NOT ABLE TO TAKE IT OFF SO I'VE RE INTRODUCED IT AND- I THINK I WOULD JUST LET MY WITNESSES AND SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF NATASHA MINSKER FROM SMART JUSTICE NCP'S JOHNSON. EIGHTEEN T. OPERATOR WHENEVER. EITHER OF THE WITNESSES ARE READY AND SUPPORT TO BEGIN. CERTAINLY THERE LINE FOR US. THIS IS AN ATTACHMENT THANK YOU CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE SB SIXTEEN OF A MODEST PROPOSAL BUT ADDRESSES THE PROBLEMS FAMILY MEMBERS AND THE PUBLIC HAVE ENCOUNTERED IN ACCESSING POLICE MISCONDUCT RECORDS UNDER SENATOR SKINNER'S LANDMARK BILL SB FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE. FOR FORTY YEARS RECORDS OF SERIOUS MISCONDUCT BY POLICE WERE KEPT SECRET AND HIDDEN FROM THE PUBLIC. CENTER SKINNER'S BILL RESTORED THE PUBLIC'S RIGHT TO KNOW ABOUT SERIOUS MISCONDUCT BY POLICE. IMMEDIATELY FAMILY MEMBERS REPORTERS AND THE PUBLIC REQUESTED RECORDS AND IMMEDIATELY THEY ENCOUNTERED SERIOUS ROADBLOCKS. DEPARTMENT DESTROYED RECORDS WHICH THEY ARE LEGALLY PERMITTED TO DO UNDER CURRENT LAW. DEPARTMENTS USE ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE TO PREVENT THE FACTUAL DISCLOSURE THAT DISCLOSURE OF FACTUAL STATEMENTS BY WITNESSES. FAMILIES WERE CHARGED THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS FOR QUOTE COPYING FEES FOR RECORDS THAT ARE KEPT IN DIGITAL FORM THAT CAN BE EASILY DUPLICATED. OFFICERS RESIGNED TO BLOCK DISCLOSURE. RIGHT AWAY FOR WEEKS MONTHS EVEN MORE THAN A YEAR BEFORE DISPOSING RECORDS. SB SIXTEEN ASSEMBLY REMOVES THESE ROADBLOCKS AND MAKE MEANINGFUL THE PUBLIC'S RIGHT TO KNOW ABOUT SERIOUS MISCONDUCT BY POLICE AS THE LEGISLATURE INTENDED. SB SIXTEEN ALSO PROVIDES A MODEST EXPANSION OF PUBLIC ACCESS TO CRITICALLY IMPORTANT RECORDS SPECIFICALLY AT THE SIXTEEN ALLOWS PUBLIC ACCESS TO SUSTAIN TO COMPLAINTS OF BIAS AND PREJUDICE BY AN OFFICER. FIFTEEN COMPLAINTS OF ILLEGAL SEARCHES OR ARRESTS. AND COMPLAINTS OF EXCESSIVE USE OF FORCE WHICH ARE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT FOR PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE. SB SIXTEEN IS A MODEST PROPOSAL TO ENSURE THAT THE PUBLIC HAS ACCESS TO INFORMATION. AND IS ABLE TO ASSESS WHETHER POLICE DEPARTMENTS ARE TAKING MISCONDUCT SERIOUSLY. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT STEP FORWARD TO BUILD TRUST BETWEEN COMMUNITIES AND POLICE ON BEHALF OF BOTH MARKUPS OF CALIFORNIA AND THE PROSECUTORS ALLIANCE OF CALIFORNIA AYE URGING AYE VOTE THANK YOU.

GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS WHO SHALL MATURE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LAW ENFORCEMENT ASSOCIATION OF RECORDS TO PROVIDERS- AND I RESPECTFULLY IN OPPOSITION TO SENATE BILL. SIXTEEN THAT'S REPRESENTATIVE OF FOR OVER FOUR HUNDRED LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES ACROSS THE STATE- WE HANDLE A HIGH VOLUME OF PUBLIC RECORD. ACT REQUEST UNDERGOING FINANCIAL STRESS SB SIXTEEN WILL CREATE A SUBSTANTIAL BURDEN ON RECORDS MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL TO COMPLY WITH A VERY LABOR INTENSIVE AND COST PROHIBITIVE TASK EVEN AS RISING COSTS AND INADEQUATE REVENUES HAVE TIGHTEN OUR RECORDS MANAGEMENT BUDGET. UNDER CURRENT LAW AGENCIES RETAIN OFFICER AT PERSON OFF ON A FULL FIVE YEARS AFTER THE OFFICE AT LEAST AGENCY FOR ANOTHER AGENCY OR RETIRES.

YEAH CAN PLAY BY ITS SIX. H. A. WILL BE. TO THE SYSTEM OF STORING PERSONAL RECORDS WITHOUT ANY THOUGHT TO BUDGETING OR LOGISTICS PROPERTY TO BE VERY CLEAR IT'S NOT JUST ACTUALLY OPPOSED SENATE BILL SIXTEEN THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS CORY CELLS L. O. ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION RECENTLY MOVING FROM OPPOSED TO OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED. WE APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S EFFORTS THUS FAR TO CRAFT THE BILL- WE WOULDN'T KNOW THAT- SB FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE MADE SPECIFIED RECORDS AVAILABLE FOR PUBLIC DISCLOSURE BUT MAINLY LIMITED THE SCOPE OF WHAT COULD BE RELEASED. TO RECORDS RELATING TO USES OF FORCE THAT RESULTED IN DEATH OR GREAT BODILY INJURY OR OTHER SITUATIONS IN WHICH A COMPLAINT OF WRONGDOING HAD BEEN SUSTAINED. SB SIXTEEN EXPANDS THE RECORDS ON USE OF FORCE ALLEGATIONS THAT CAN BE RELEASED TO INCLUDE COMPLAINTS THAT ALLEGE UNREASONABLE OR EXCESSIVE FORCE. FURTHER THE BILL LANGUAGE PROVIDING THAT THE ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE SHALL NOT BE ASSERTED TO LIMIT THE DISCLOSURE OF FACTUAL INFORMATION IS UNNECESSARY. AND COULD UNDERMINE EFFECTIVE REPRESENTATION OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS BY THEIR COUNSEL. UNDER EXISTING CASE LAW GENERALLY SPEAKING INFORMATION THAT IS NOT OTHERWISE PRIVILEGE DOES NOT BECOME PRIVILEGE SIMPLY BECAUSE IT IS COMMUNICATED TO AN ATTORNEY. ADDITIONALLY PERMITTING DISCLOSURE OF BILLING RECORDS LITIGATION UNFOLDS KALAU PLAN IS TO DETERMINE WHERE THE ATTORNEYS REPRESENTING THE MUNICIPALITY IS FOCUSING HIS OR HER EFFORTS ON DEFENSE. INCLUDING WHAT SERIES OR DEFENSES THEY INTEND TO PURSUE. AGAIN WE APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENTS TAKEN TO REMOVE PROVISIONS RELATED TO CIVIL FINES IN THE ABILITY TO SEE COSTS AND ATTORNEYS FEES. AND IF THE BILL WERE FURTHER REMANDED TWO ONE LIMIT THE NEW USE OF FORCE PROVISION DESCRIBED ABOVE. TO PERMIT DISCLOSURE OF RECORDS RELATING TO AN INCIDENT INVOLVING A SUSTAINED FINDING EXCESSIVE FORCE. AND TO REMOVE THE LANGUAGE RELATIVE TO THE ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE CSSA WOULD REMOVE ITS OPPOSITION THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. NOW COME TO THE COMMITTEE RUMORED ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION C.

GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS AT LEAST OUR CITY ACCOUNT- WITH THE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES WE APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENT TAKEN BY THE OP BY THE AUTHOR BUT REMAIN OPPOSED. YOU SHOULD BE ACTED TURNED OUTLINED IN OUR LETTER THANK YOU. THANK YOU. YEAH. TRANSACTION. CALLING IT'S SHOWING NO FOR THE LINE QUEUED UP IN OPPOSITION AS CHAIR. THANK YOU BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE FOR ANY COMMENTS OR DISCUSSIONS MISTER QUESTIONS YEAH I. I'D LIKE THIS TO BE A VERY- DIFFICULT BILL FOR ME TO WORK THROUGH- BECAUSE I DON'T WANT WANT TO LOOK LIKE I'M TRYING TO PROTECT. UNSCRUPULOUS AND- PROBLEMATIC. AND OFFICERS WHO HAVE- ENGAGED IN MISCONDUCT BUT I STILL HAVE A FEW CONCERNS THAT WERE. EXPRESSED BY SOME OF THE OPPOSITION. SO I'M GONNA LAUGH TODAY AND HOPING THAT YOU WILL WORK WITH THOSE PEOPLE. AND GET THE AMENDMENTS TO WHERE I THINK. IT'S ACCEPTABLE SO THAT IT'S NOT UNFAIRLY. TARGETING OF PEOPLE WHO DON'T DESERVE TO BE UNFAIRLY TARGETED AND SO. I'LL BE LAYING OFF TODAY IN HOPES THAT I MIGHT BE ABLE TO GET TO WHERE I COULD SUPPORT. THANK YOU. IN MORE. THE QUESTION IS A QUESTION. YOU YOU MAY CLOSE Q. I KNOW YOU'VE HAD A LONG DAY WHICH IS WHY DIDN'T EXPLAIN A LOT OF THE BILL BUT BASICALLY IT'S- A LIMITED EXPANSION OF. PUBLIC ACCESS TO SOME RECORDS ON A SET OF- CONDUCT BY OFFICERS WHICH- THE- ARE WITNESSING SUPPORT ARTICULATED AND THESE ARE IN ALL CASES BUT ONE SUSTAIN FINDINGS. SO THEY MUST BE THE OFFICERS CONDUCT MUST HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATED AND SUSTAIN BEFORE THESE RCORDS WOULD BE RELEASED. NO MY THE BILL WHEN IT PASSED LAST YEAR. HAD VERY HIGH FINES ON WEEK BECAUSE WE EXPERIENCED WHEN FOR AFTER FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE WAS PASSED THAT MANY CITIES REALLY DIRECTOR FEET THERE ARE STILL JURISDICTIONS THAT HAVE NOT RELEASED RECORDS. SO WE ADDED SOME FINES AND WE'RE GOING TO ADD ATTORNEY'S FEES BUT WE REMOVED TO THOSE. IN THE SENATE APPROACH BECAUSE WE REALIZE THAT. WHILE WE WANT TO INCREASE ENFORCEMENT IT WOULD STILL REQUIRE SOMEONE TO TAKE THE JURISDICTION OF COURT AND SO REALLY WHAT WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO DO IS ACHIEVE GOOD WELL. AND WE KNOW THAT- WHAT HAPPENED WITH FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE IST WHEN IT WENT INTO EFFECT THERE WAS A FLOOD OF REQUESTS RIGHT IN THE BEGINNING OF JANUARY AND IT WAS A LOT OF WORK FOR THE JURISDICTION SO IF YOU NOTICE WHAT OF. THE AMENDMENTS I ALSO TOOK IS THAT I'VE DELAYED. THAT THERE'S NO TIME LIMITATIONS ARE PENALTIES BETWEEN. TWENTY JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY TWO IN JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY THREE SO THAT AGENCIES HAVE A FOUR YEAR DEAL GET THE REQUEST OPTED TO REQUEST WILL COME IN IF THE BILL SIGNED. THE REQUESTS FOR THESE RECORDS WILL GET SUBMITTED HOWEVER THEY DON'T HAVE TO JUST TURN AROUND AND THIRTY DAYS. AND RELEASE THEM SO WE FELT THAT THAT WAS MORE THAN FAIR. AND MOST RECORDS ARE NOW DIGITAL SO MANY OF THE CONCERNS ABOUT THE STORAGE WE HAD LESS WE FELT WERE NOT AS GREAT OF MERIT. AND- THE IS WHY THE POLICE CHIEFS NOW SUPPORT AND MOST LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES ARE NEUTRAL ON THE BILL NOT A IN OPPOSITION AND IF WE COMPARE THAT TO THE FIRST SET OF RECORDS WE TRIED TO THE FIRST BILL. THERE WAS GREAT LAW ENFORCEMENT OPPOSITION SO I THINK WE'VE MOVED. A LOT NOT JUST ME BUT ALSO. PARTNERS AND- OUR PUBLIC ARE LAW ENFORCEMENT I'VE REALLY APPRECIATED I REALLY HAVE ENJOYED WORKING WITH THEM. AND I THINK I WILL CERTAINLY WAY THE- FOR EXAMPLE- THE SHERIFF'S. LETTERS ONLY RECENT SO I'LL CERTAINLY WAY WITH THEY'VE RAISED- BUT FOR TODAY I WOULD ASK YOUR AYE VOTE AND I THINK THE BILL'S VERY SOUND. AND I'M TAKING THE COMMITTEES- THE AMENDMENTS. THAT I'M ACCEPTING OR THE WHISTLE BLOWER CLARIFICATION AND REQUIRING THAT THE MISCONDUCT REGARDING BIAS AND PREJUDICE MUST BE SUSTAINED THE RECORDS CANNOT BE RELEASED UNLESS THAT CONTACT. WAS INVESTIGATED INSISTING. WE'LL HELP YOU WITH. WE DON'T HAVE BEEN MIXED UP WHY IS IT SAY THAT. IS IT IN BLIGHTED SMILE WHICH BRIDGE GO FROM HERE. FOR ME TO CHECK MY THANK YOU MANAGING JUDICIARY COMMITTEE WELL MAYBE IT'S FOR DEEP DISH THOUGH IT SAYS PS LET ME ASK MY STAFF. ABOUT A COMMITMENT TO IT IF YOU COULD CALL NINE.

SENATE BILL COULD YOU ADD ONS FOR READING SB THREE ONE SEVEN STERN- HOPEFULLY HE GETS HERE. RIGHT NOW COME TO PUT COME TO RUSSIA YOUR TURN. MOVE THE BILL THANK. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE WE NEED THE- WHITE THINGS DOWN IN. OKAY GREAT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I'LL BE BRIEF- I DON'T THINK THIS BILL IS GOING TO FIX THE ENTIRE MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS GOING ON- FOR INCARCERATED CALIFORNIANS I AM NOT UNDER. ANY ILLUSION THAT- THERE'S GOING TO BE ONE OF SILVER BULLET TO SOLVING THESE CRISES BUT- IN THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES- AND WITH OUR PUBLIC DEFENDERS I THINK THIS BILL PRESENTS. A REALLY IMPORTANT FRAMEWORK TO ENSURE THAT THOSE DEFENDANTS WHO ARE JUDGED TO BE INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL AND THEN ESSENTIALLY CIVILLY CONFINED DURING THAT PROCESS AND HOSPITALIZATION OR OTHER. TREATMENT PROGRAMS THAT THAT'S NOT COUNTED AGAINST THEM- THOSE FACILITIES INTO ACCOUNT AND HOPEFULLY- WE CAN FIND BETTER WAYS TO USE THAT KIND OF TREATMENT- AND NOT TRY TO DO MENTAL HEALTH CARE IN OUR JAILS WE'RE JUST NOT WORKING- I ALSO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE. I KNOW THERE WERE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT- SCOPE- AND CLARITY- IN TERMS OF THE- WHAT THE- THEIR WHAT WHAT KIND OF- TRIALS THIS WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR- WE WANT TO CLARIFY IN THE BILL THAT THE SERVICES CAN ONLY BE ORDERED IF THE COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS ALREADY HAVE SERVICES AND ARE WILLING TO ACCEPT THE DEFENDANT. WE ALSO WANT TO AUTHORIZE THE COURTS TO REFER. INCOMPETENT DEFENDANTS TO A UP TO ASSISTED OUTPATIENT TREATMENT. UNDER LAURA'S LAW. AND PROVIDING SOME KIND OF MIDDLE GROUND BETWEEN ST DIVERSION AND THEN CONSERVATORSHIP- AND THEN ALSO TO INCLUDE TIMELINES THAT ENSURE SPEEDY ACCESS TO TREATMENT AND LIMIT. UNDUE PERIODS OF INCARCERATION FOR PEOPLE CHARGED WITH MISDEMEANORS WHO ARE COMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL AND JUST TO BE CLEAR MEMBERS THIS IS. INTENDED JUST TO BE ABOUT MISDEMEANORS HERE WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT- OTHER CRIMES SO- IF THAT'S NEEDED TO BE CLARIFIED AS WELL. I'M HAPPY TO DO THAT- AND I RICARDO GARCIA HERE L. A. COUNTY PUBLIC DEFENDER AND A CONTRA COSTA PUBLIC DEFENDER STEPHANIE REGULAR. STEADFAST RAP. THANK YOU AND YOU EITHER WANT TO MAYBE GET IT WHENEVER YOU'RE READY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT. EVERY YES HELLO OKAY GREAT GOOD AFTERNOON AND- THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO YOU TODAY. AND THANK YOU TO EVERYONE WHO WORKED DILIGENTLY TO BRING GREATER DIGNITY AND EQUITY TO THE JERRY VOLATILE POPULATION. I AM RICARDO GARCIA THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY PUBLIC DEFENDER. BRADLEY READ THE LARGEST AND OLDEST PUBLIC DEFENDER OFFICE IN THE NATION. AND I'VE BEEN WITH OVER TWENTY FIVE YEARS- MY CAREER DEFENDING THE VERY PEOPLE THAT THE BILL WOULD SEEK TO PROTECT. THE MODEL NUMBER THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION. SENATE BILL THREE SEVENTEEN. WILL ENSURE THE PRESUMED INNOCENT PEOPLE WHO WERE DETAINED IN THE STATE HOSPITAL FOR OTHER MANDATORY DETENTION BECAUSE OF MENTAL ILLNESS. ST CUSTODY CREDITS. PER UNIT IN PEOPLE. INCARCERATED IN COUNTY JAIL. CURTAIN ALL CONDUCT CLINICS PEOPLE WHO ARE INVOLUNTARILY CARS GRANT PRETRIAL. CREDITS ARE OFTEN THE ONLY BENEFIT OF COMPOUND INCARCERATION. HOWEVER EACH YEAR APPROXIMATELY TWO THOUSAND THIS TWO THOUSAND PRESUMED INNOCENT PEOPLE WITH SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS WHO ARE DETAINED PRE TRIAL BECAUSE OF THEIR MENTAL ILLNESS ARE NOT AWARDED THE SAME CREDIT. REPORTER ON SECOND. FOR THE LOG TODAY PUNISHES CALIFORNIANS SUFFERING FROM A MENTAL ILLNESS MORE HEAVILY USED SEVERELY THAN THOSE CORE NOT ONLY BECAUSE THEY ARE MENTALLY ILL. BECAUSE PRACTICE FURTHER PUNISHES CONDUCT THAT IS THE PRODUCT OF MENTAL ILLNESS. TO RESPOND JUST AND HUMANE. WE MUST CREATE AND HELP PEOPLE SUFFERING FROM MENTAL ILLNESS NOT PUNISH THE- THEY SHOULD NOT BE KEPT IN A CAGE. HOWEVER IF THE MENTALLY ILL ARE HELD AGAINST THEIR WILL THEY SHOULD RECEIVE THE SAME CREDITED PEOPLE HELD WITHOUT SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS. SORRY AFTER STUDY SHOWS THAT JUGGLING THE MENTALLY ILL AND DANGEROUS IMPACT ON MENTAL HEALTH. INCARCERATION CAUSES PEOPLE WITH MENTAL ILLNESS TO BE COMPENSATE AND FACE MORE SEVERE COMPLICATIONS INDICATIONS AND LIVES INCLUDING THE INCREASED LIKELIHOOD OF A REAL SENSE. THE CURRENT LAW IS ALSO FISCALLY IMPRUDENT. TAXPAYERS IN CALIFORNIA MUST PAY THE EXTRA IN CONSULTATION COST FOR MENTALLY ILL PERSON SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY DO NOT GET THE SAME CONDUCT CREDITS AS OTHERS. SB THREE ONE SEVEN WILL CLARIFY THE COMBAT CREDIT STATUTE. TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE WHO BECAUSE OF THEIR MENTAL ILLNESS SPEND THEIR PRE TELL TIME INCARCERATED IN STATE HOSPITAL OR OTHER AS I SAID MENTAL MANDATORY RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT FACILITY RECEIVED THE SAME CREDITS AT EVERYONE ELSE. IT IS CRITICAL THAT WE PROTECT INDIVIDUALS IN VULNERABLE POPULATIONS WHOSE CONDUCT IS THE PRODUCT OF THEIR MENTAL ILLNESS. WE MUST TREAT PEOPLE WITH MENTAL ILLNESS WITH THE SAME CARE AND COMPASSION WE TREAT ANYONE WITH A MEDICAL CONDITION. PERHAPS EVEN MORE SO I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME THANK YOU. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS STEPHANIE REGULAR AND A BOARD MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDER ASSOCIATION A CO SPONSOR SB THREE SEVENTEEN. I'VE ALSO BEEN A PUBLIC DEFENDER FOR TWENTY YEARS AND THE CONTRA COSTA COUNTY PUBLIC DEFENDER MENTAL HEALTH UNIT FOR THE PAST TEN YEARS. DESPITE INNOVATIVE REFORM EFFORTS BY THE LEGISLATURE. TO DIVERT INDIVIDUALS SUFFERING FROM MENTAL ILLNESS FROM CRIMINAL LEGAL SYSTEM. THOSE WERE CHARGED WITH MISDEMEANOR. FOUND INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL. REMAINER JAILED IN STATE HOSPITAL THAT. I THINK THE SAME PEOPLE YEAR AFTER YEAR AND I THINK THE CALL THAT HOMELESSNESS REPEAT INCARCERATIONS AND ENACT IN ADEQUATE ACCESS TO TREATMENT HAS ON THEIR PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH. UNDER EXISTING LAW THE COUNTIES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR INDIVIDUALS CHARGED WITH MISDEMEANORS WERE FOUND INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL. IN THE COUNTY PRESS DEDICATE THEIR ONLY. TO COMPANY COMPETENCY RESTORATION. THESE RESTORATION SERVICES RANGE FROM COUNTY TO COUNTY WITH A FOCUS ON SHORT TERM STABILITY RATHER THAN LONG TERM SOLUTIONS. I'M COUNTY USE THEIR COSTLY INPATIENT PSYCHIATRIC BEDS FOR RESTORATION. OTHER COUNTIES COMMITTEES AND VIGILS CHARGED WITH MISDEMEANORS TO THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE HOSPITALS DESPITE THE FOURTEEN HUNDRED PERSON WAITLIST AND DAILY COST OF SIX HUNDRED TWENTY SIX DOLLARS BUT THAT. AND MANY COUNTY HOW THESE INDIVIDUALS IN THE JAIL AND HOW THEY REACHED THE END OF THEIR COMMITMENT. WHAT IS STABILIZED AND COUNTY INPATIENT BAD. RESTORED AND THE STATE HOSPITAL ARE MAXED OUT IN THE COUNTY JAIL. IN THE END THESE PEOPLE ARE ALL TYPICALLY RELIEF TO THE STREET. WITH NO CONTINUITY OF CARE. THIRTEEN SEVENTY POINT OH ONE AS CURRENTLY WRITTEN. DID NOT IMPROVE OUTCOMES FOR INDIVIDUALS SUFFERING FROM MENTAL ILLNESS. BUT THIS BILL CAN. THIS BILL AUTHORED COURTS TO FLEXIBILITY TO EXISTING DIVERSION PROGRAM ALLAFRICA COURT AND OTHER COMMUNITY BASED TREATMENT OPTIONS TO TREAT RATHER THAN INCARCERATED HEARTRATE MISDEMEANOR OFFERING SOME SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS. AND THIS BILL ALLOWS CHINESE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT TO FOCUS ON EVIDENCE BASED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SOLUTIONS. WE RESPECTFULLY URGE AND I PULL IT OUT THANK YOU.
