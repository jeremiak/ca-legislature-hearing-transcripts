RIGHTLY POINTS OUT.

00:03:08.288 --> 00:03:09.856
THIS STANDARD IS THAT THIS IS A

00:03:09.923 --> 00:03:11.057
STANDARD PRACTICE IN THE

00:03:27.707 --> 00:03:29.075
IT MAY BE INTERPRETED AS

00:03:29.142 --> 00:03:31.377
LIMITING THE OTHER INSTANCES IN

00:03:31.444 --> 00:03:33.646

CONTACT CAN BE USED.

00:03:35.582 --> 00:03:36.883
OUR PROPOSED AMENDMENT WOULD

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:38.384
ALSO CLEAR FIGHT THAT WE CAN

OF THE SENATOR IT DOES NEED TO

00:03:48.595 --> 00:03:49.696
BE CLARIFIED.

00:03:49.762 --> 00:03:51.431

PROCESS.

00:04:48.988 --> 00:04:50.623

00:06:12.805 --> 00:06:13.172
SHORT.

DURING MY TENURE AT THE CFPB I

OVERSAW THE DELIBERATION OF MOST

00:20:27.659 --> 00:20:29.061
IF NOT ALL OF THE POLICY

00:20:29.127 --> 00:20:30.629
QUESTIONS THIS COMMITTEE MAY BE

00:20:30.696 --> 00:20:31.663
WRESTLING WITH.

00:20:31.730 --> 00:20:32.698
AND I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE MY

00:20:32.764 --> 00:20:33.799
VIEWS TODAY.

00:20:33.865 --> 00:20:35.300
THESE VIEWS ARE WHAT ARE OF MY

00:20:35.367 --> 00:20:38.704

MY FORMER AGENCY.

00:20:40.305 --> 00:20:41.440
FIRST QUESTION IS.

00:20:41.506 --> 00:20:43.141
IS IT UP TO A CREDIT.

00:20:43.208 --> 00:20:44.376
WHETHER OR NOT YOU W. IS

CONSIDERED CREDIT IS IMPORTANT A

00:20:46.511 --> 00:20:48.246
QUESTION DETERMINING HOW YOU W.

00:20:48.313 --> 00:20:51.283
A. SHOULD BE PROPERLY REGULATED.

00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:54.853
AND IN SHORT IN MY OPINION YOU

00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:56.622
DON'T DO IS NOT CREDIT.

00:20:56.688 --> 00:20:58.023
THE CORE PRINCIPLE OF EW ISN'T

00:20:58.090 --> 00:21:00.092
IT REALLY REALLY VERY SIMPLE.

00:21:00.158 --> 00:21:02.294
ONE SHOULD BE ABLE TO ACCESS HIS

00:21:02.361 --> 00:21:04.062
OR HER OWN A CREW WAGES.

00:21:04.129 --> 00:21:05.864
A PORTION OF THE MONEY THEY HAVE

00:21:05.931 --> 00:21:07.799
ALREADY EARNS ON DEMAND AND THE

00:21:07.866 --> 00:21:10.068
WITHOUT CREATING A DEBT

00:21:10.135 --> 00:21:10.736
OBLIGATION.

00:21:10.802 --> 00:21:12.004
THE BILL IS BASED ON THE CREW

00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:14.706
WAGES THAT ARE YET TO BE PAID.

00:21:14.773 --> 00:21:16.775
IF NO WAGES AREN'T NO ACCESS IS

00:21:16.842 --> 00:21:17.976
GRANTED.

00:21:18.043 --> 00:21:20.212
NO FUTURE WAGES AND TO THE

00:21:20.278 --> 00:21:21.513
SPECULATIVE RISK ASSOCIATED WAS

00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:24.282
TAPPING INTO THEM ARE IMPICATED.

00:21:24.349 --> 00:21:26.184
THINGS THAT CONSUMERS PAY A

00:21:26.251 --> 00:21:29.755
FIXED ONE TIME NONRECURRING FEE

00:21:29.821 --> 00:21:31.056
TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS PHONES

00:21:31.123 --> 00:21:33.859
BASED UPON OR CALCULATE THE PONG

00:21:33.925 --> 00:21:36.228
A PORTION OF THE OUR CREW INCOME.

00:21:36.294 --> 00:21:37.696
THERE IS NO DEBTS THERE'S NO

00:21:37.763 --> 00:21:39.231
INTEREST CHARGE THERE'S NO

00:21:39.297 --> 00:21:41.199
COLLATERAL OR SECURITY INTERESTS

00:21:41.266 --> 00:21:45.237
TAKEN FROM THE EMPLOYEE CONSUMER

00:21:45.303 --> 00:21:47.839
HOLDING PLAYER.

00:21:47.906 --> 00:21:49.107
AFTER CAREFULLY SCRUTINIZING

00:21:49.174 --> 00:21:50.776
EITHER UPDATE FOR ONE THE CFPB

00:21:50.842 --> 00:21:51.910
DECISION TO EXEMPT YOU W. A.

00:21:51.977 --> 00:21:52.944
FROM THE ABILITY TO REPAY

00:21:53.011 --> 00:21:54.746
REQUIREMENTS.

00:21:54.813 --> 00:21:55.981
IN THE FINAL PAY THE RULE.

00:21:56.048 --> 00:21:57.149
SEND A VERY STRONG AND CLEAR

00:21:57.215 --> 00:21:58.250
MESSAGE THAT THE EW ES IS NOT

00:21:58.316 --> 00:22:00.519
CREDIT.

00:22:00.585 --> 00:22:01.119
THE SECOND QUESTION IS REALLY

00:22:01.186 --> 00:22:02.454
ABOUT.

00:22:02.521 --> 00:22:04.089
DOES EITHER BE A PROVIDE A LOWER

00:22:04.156 --> 00:22:05.590
COST ALTERNATIVE.

00:22:05.657 --> 00:22:07.292
WHILE I PERSONALLY BELIEVE THAT

00:22:07.359 --> 00:22:08.660
MARKET FORCES REALLY IN

00:22:08.727 --> 00:22:10.162
ULTIMATELY DETERMINE THE PRICES

00:22:10.228 --> 00:22:13.031
AS AS PROVIDERS COMPETE.

00:22:13.098 --> 00:22:14.433
I UNDERSTAND WHY STATES MY

00:22:14.499 --> 00:22:16.601
WANTING STILL A PRICE CAP.

00:22:16.668 --> 00:22:18.437
THIS BILL DOES EXACTLY THAT.

00:22:18.503 --> 00:22:20.706
IN NO EVENT UNDER THIS BILL.

00:22:20.772 --> 00:22:22.808
MAY THE TOTAL FEE CHARGED TO A

00:22:22.874 --> 00:22:24.376
CONSUMER IN A SINGLE MONTH.

00:22:24.443 --> 00:22:26.812
EXCEEDS A STRICT CAP OF FOURTEEN

00:22:26.878 --> 00:22:28.046
DOLLARS.

00:22:28.113 --> 00:22:29.281
SO THIS ESSENTIALLY TRANSLATES

00:22:29.347 --> 00:22:31.917
TO A MAXIMUM OF SEVEN DOLLARS

00:22:31.983 --> 00:22:34.086
PER BI WEEKLY OR BI MONTHLY PAY

00:22:34.152 --> 00:22:35.020
PERIODS.

00:22:35.087 --> 00:22:36.421
AND THE THREE DOLLARS AND FIFTY

00:22:36.488 --> 00:22:39.391
CENTS FOR WEEKLY PAY PERIOD.

00:22:39.458 --> 00:22:40.659
HOLIDAY BECAUSE O THE BETTER

00:22:40.726 --> 00:22:42.894
TECHNOLOGIES AND TO THE VERY

00:22:42.961 --> 00:22:44.896
NATURE OF THE EE THESE PROGRAMS

00:22:44.963 --> 00:22:46.965
AT THE PRESENT TIME ARE FAR LESS

00:22:47.032 --> 00:22:48.700
EXPENSIVE IN A FEW CAP UNDER THE

00:22:48.767 --> 00:22:49.568
BILL.

00:22:49.634 --> 00:22:50.869
AND THE FAR LESS EXPENSIVE THAN

00:22:50.936 --> 00:22:52.871
PAYDAY LOANS LATE FEES OVERDRAFT

00:22:52.938 --> 00:22:53.939
FEES.

00:22:54.005 --> 00:22:55.373
I BELIEVE THE PRICE CAP PUT IN

00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:57.342
THIS PLACE PUTTING PLACING SPELL

00:22:57.409 --> 00:23:00.212
IS VERY REASONABLE AND CAL WORK

00:23:00.278 --> 00:23:01.513
FOR MOST EW ES PROVIDERS.

00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:03.281
LET ME JUST TAKE A MOMENT TO TO

00:23:03.348 --> 00:23:08.186
SHARE WITH YOU -- A CASE STUDY

00:23:08.253 --> 00:23:10.422
FOR P. ACTIVE [inaudible]

00:23:10.489 --> 00:23:12.924
ALL [inaudible]

00:23:12.991 --> 00:23:16.027
FASTER.

00:23:16.094 --> 00:23:16.795
IN THE PICTURE PATTY WAS CASE

00:23:16.862 --> 00:23:18.697
THE CUSTOMER TO ACCESS UP TO

00:23:18.764 --> 00:23:19.798
FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS.

00:23:19.865 --> 00:23:21.867
OF HIS ARM -- WAGE UP TO THREE

00:23:21.933 --> 00:23:23.602
TIMES PER PAY PERIOD. FOR SINGLE

00:23:23.668 --> 00:23:24.936
FEE OF FIVE DOLLARS THIS

00:23:25.003 --> 00:23:27.205
COMPARES TO A TYPICAL FORTY FIVE

00:23:27.272 --> 00:23:29.841
DOLLAR CHARGE FOR A TWO HUNDRED

00:23:29.908 --> 00:23:30.942
FIFTY FIVE DOLLARS HAD A LONG.

00:23:31.009 --> 00:23:32.410
SO AS YOU CAN SEE.

00:23:32.477 --> 00:23:35.847
THE PRICE POINTS THERE'S NO

00:23:35.914 --> 00:23:37.048
COMPARISON.

00:23:37.115 --> 00:23:38.784
pFURTHER A GUARD RAILS TO AVOID

00:23:38.850 --> 00:23:40.185
THAT TRAPS IT ALLOWS CONSUMERS

00:23:40.252 --> 00:23:41.753
TO CHOOSE TO ACCESS EW ES UP TO

00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:43.255
THREE TIMES IN A PAY PERIOD.

00:23:43.321 --> 00:23:44.723
NOT TO EXCEED 50% OF THE CREW

00:23:44.790 --> 00:23:46.591
AGES.

00:23:46.658 --> 00:23:47.592
THE THIRD QUESTION IS IS REALLY

00:23:47.659 --> 00:23:50.495
ABOUT DOES IT UP THEY PROVIDE A

00:23:50.562 --> 00:23:51.730
LESS RISKY ALTERNATIVE.

00:23:51.797 --> 00:23:53.832
SO I WILL I WOULD ARGUE THE BILL

00:23:53.899 --> 00:23:56.635
IS FAR LESS RISKY AND IF YOU

00:23:56.701 --> 00:23:57.936
STRUCTURE WELL -- YOU CAN

00:23:58.003 --> 00:24:00.405
PROVIDE A MUCH BETTER AND SAFER

00:24:00.472 --> 00:24:02.474
ALTERNATIVE.

00:24:02.541 --> 00:24:03.642
AND THIS BILL REQUIRED TO GET UP

00:24:03.708 --> 00:24:04.543
A NOT TO HAVE RECORDS I THINK

00:24:04.609 --> 00:24:05.977
THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT POINT I

00:24:06.044 --> 00:24:08.547
WANT TO MAKE HERE -- I AND I

00:24:08.613 --> 00:24:12.083
BELIEVE IN IN THE CURRENT -- AT

00:24:12.150 --> 00:24:13.251
PRESENT MOST OF THE W. PROGRAMS

00:24:13.318 --> 00:24:14.719
IN THE MARKET TODAY DON'T HAVE

00:24:14.786 --> 00:24:17.389
RECOURSE SO IF FULL IF FOR

00:24:17.455 --> 00:24:18.857
WHATEVER REASON OR FOR NO REASON

00:24:18.924 --> 00:24:19.558
AT ALL.

00:24:19.624 --> 00:24:20.959
THE CONSUMER DECIDES NOT TO

00:24:21.026 --> 00:24:22.527
REIMBURSABLE PROVIDER THE

00:24:22.594 --> 00:24:23.962
CONSUMER IS HELD COMPLETELY

00:24:24.029 --> 00:24:26.164
HARMLESS AS A PROVIDER HAS NO

00:24:26.231 --> 00:24:27.766
RECOURSE AGAINST CONSUMERS.

00:24:27.833 --> 00:24:28.900
THE WORST CASE THAT HAPPENS THE

00:24:28.967 --> 00:24:32.337
CONSUMER IS THE LAW ALSO FUTURE

00:24:32.404 --> 00:24:36.441
ACCESS WITHOUT DELAY.

00:24:36.508 --> 00:24:37.876
THE LAST POINT OUT TO MAKE A IS

00:24:37.943 --> 00:24:39.711
THIS BILL REQUIRES THE CONSUMERS

00:24:39.778 --> 00:24:40.946
NOT TO BE COMPELLED. TO

00:24:41.012 --> 00:24:42.047
ESTABLISH A ACCOUNTS WAS A

00:24:42.113 --> 00:24:44.616

00:24:54.092 --> 00:24:55.126
PROTECTION BUREAU.

00:24:55.193 --> 00:24:56.895
THIS PROVISION BASICALLY ENSURES

00:24:56.962 --> 00:24:58.697
THAT CONSUMERS ARE NOT TO BE

00:24:58.763 --> 00:25:01.199
TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF BY A RULED

00:25:09.641 --> 00:25:10.508
LAST DAY.

00:25:10.575 --> 00:25:11.142
ALTHOUGH THE NATURE IN THE TERMS

00:25:11.209 --> 00:25:11.910
OF THE W. PROGRAMS ARE FAR

00:25:11.977 --> 00:25:12.978
SIMPLER AND EASILY

00:25:13.044 --> 00:25:14.512
UNDERSTANDABLE FROM FOR

00:25:14.579 --> 00:25:16.414
CONSUMERS WHEN COMPARED WITH

00:25:16.481 --> 00:25:17.816

RESPONSIBLY USE IT ON THE WAY.

00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:26.258
MANY PROVIDERS TODAY ALREADY

00:25:26.324 --> 00:25:27.292
OFFER FINANCIAL WELLNESS

FINALLY THIS BILL PROVIDES A

00:25:49.447 --> 00:25:50.282

SO -- AND AND THE ATTORNEYS --

00:27:00.885 --> 00:27:02.253
NATIONALLY ARE PRETTY BUSY WITH

00:41:41.665 --> 00:41:43.033
IN FACT HELLO MIKE THIS IS

00:41:43.100 --> 00:41:44.702
ILLEGAL IN THIRTY SEVEN STATES

00:41:44.768 --> 00:41:46.270

CAPS OF 36% OR LESS -- DURING

00:41:49.206 --> 00:41:51.475
THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION IN TWO

00:41:51.542 --> 00:41:52.276
THOUSAND SIX CONGRESS PASSED THE

00:41:52.343 --> 00:41:54.245
MILITARY LENDING ACT THAT

00:41:58.582 --> 00:42:01.151
CALIFORNIA'S BEHIND AN SB FOUR

00:42:01.218 --> 00:42:02.653
EIGHTY TWO DOES NOT SOLVE THE

00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:03.621
PROBLEM.

00:42:03.687 --> 00:42:05.155
SB FORTY TWO WOULD ALLOW

00:42:05.222 --> 00:42:07.191
PREDATORY LENDERS TO DO BUSINESS

00:42:07.258 --> 00:42:09.159
AS USUAL SPECIFICALLY THE

00:42:09.226 --> 00:42:10.427
UNDERWRITING STANDARDS ARE WEAK

00:42:10.494 --> 00:42:12.129
AND DO NOT ENSURE THAT BORROWERS

00:42:12.196 --> 00:42:13.697
ARE PROTECTED FROM ON AFFORDABLE

00:42:13.764 --> 00:42:14.698
LOANS.

00:42:14.765 --> 00:42:20.137
SB FORTY TWO DOES NOT PREVENT A

00:42:20.204 --> 00:42:21.906
LENDER FOR MAKING A LOAN EAT

00:42:21.972 --> 00:42:22.873
WHICH EQUALED OR EVEN EXCEEDED

00:42:22.940 --> 00:42:23.440
THE AMOUNT OF A BORROWER'S

00:42:23.507 --> 00:42:24.308

REPAYMENT PERIOD -- IN ADDITION

00:42:26.443 --> 00:42:27.912
SB FORTY TWO DOES NOT PROHIBIT A

00:42:27.978 --> 00:42:30.180
LENDER FROM EXTENDING A LOAN OF

00:42:30.247 --> 00:42:31.148
FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS TO FIFTEEN

00:42:31.215 --> 00:42:33.017
YEARS WHILE THIS MAY BRING DOWN

00:42:33.083 --> 00:42:34.852
A MONTHLY PAYMENT IT WILL COST

00:42:34.919 --> 00:42:36.287
THOUSANDS MORE IN INTEREST IN

00:42:36.353 --> 00:42:37.588
FACT PREDATORY LENDERS ARE DOING

00:42:37.655 --> 00:42:38.689
THAT THIS NOW.

00:42:38.756 --> 00:42:39.924
SB FORTY TWO WOULD DIRECT

00:42:39.990 --> 00:42:41.926
LENDERS TO DISCLOSE TO CONSUMERS

00:42:41.992 --> 00:42:42.927
THE FACT THAT THESE ARE HIGH

00:42:42.993 --> 00:42:44.895
COST LOANS BUT THE UTILITY OF

00:42:44.962 --> 00:42:46.830
SUCH DISCLOSURES IS UNCERTAIN AT

00:42:46.897 --> 00:42:48.632
BEST WE'VE HEARD FIRST HAND FROM

00:42:48.699 --> 00:42:50.034
BORROWERS HAVE NOT GOTTEN

00:42:50.100 --> 00:42:52.569
DISCLOSURES -- IN BEFORE THE

FUNDS WERE DISPERSED INTO THEIR

00:42:54.305 --> 00:42:55.606
BANK ACCOUNT WHICH IS ILLEGAL.

00:42:55.673 --> 00:42:57.007
WE'VE HEARD THAT THEY HAVE NOT

00:42:57.074 --> 00:42:58.809
GOTTEN THE LEAD -- DOCUMENTS IN

00:42:58.876 --> 00:43:01.245
THEIR LANGUAGE WHICH IS ALSO.

00:43:01.312 --> 00:43:02.179
THAT'S A REQUIREMENT BY

WHAT WE NEED IS AN INTEREST RATE

00:43:07.551 --> 00:43:09.253
CAPS AND FOR THESE REASONS WE

00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:13.357
STRONGLY OPPOSE.

YOU KNOW THE THE LEGISLATURE IS

00:43:24.001 --> 00:43:28.172
RAP IS GRAPPLING WITH WHAT TO DO.

ABOUT -- A HETEROGENEOUS

00:43:30.407 --> 00:43:33.544
CONSUMER LENDING MARKET WHERE

THAT TIME AGAIN.

00:43:45.189 --> 00:43:46.957

00:43:48.525 --> 00:43:49.727
WORSE OFF THAN BEFORE THEY BEGAN.

00:43:49.793 --> 00:43:50.794

SUPREME COURT HAS RECOGNIZED

00:43:52.496 --> 00:43:53.664
THAT AND LAST YEAR THE

00:43:53.731 --> 00:43:55.566
CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT ISSUED

00:43:55.632 --> 00:43:57.201
A RULING -- IN THE CASH CALL WE

COURTS CAN FIND THAT IN THE LOAN

00:44:00.738 --> 00:44:03.007
WITH INTEREST RATES ABOVE 90%

00:44:03.073 --> 00:44:04.308

CONTRACT LAW.

00:44:07.578 --> 00:44:09.446
THAT'S THE COURT OPENING THE

AS TO WHAT'S A FAIR PRICE THE

00:44:16.420 --> 00:44:17.021
LOOK IT DOES SO IN OUR VIEW THE

00:44:17.087 --> 00:44:18.756
COURT HAS RAISED A QUESTION AND

00:44:18.822 --> 00:44:20.090
THE LEGISLATURE MUST ANSWER IT.

00:44:20.157 --> 00:44:21.492
WHAT IS A FAIR PRICE FOR A

00:44:26.730 --> 00:44:28.866
ISSUE THAT SQUARELY BEFORE THE

PRICING THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS

00:44:33.203 --> 00:44:34.405
AND SO UNFORTUNATELY WE DO NOT

00:44:34.471 --> 00:44:35.506
BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL.

00:44:35.572 --> 00:44:36.707
IS AN APPROPRIATE SOLUTION TO

00:44:36.774 --> 00:44:38.242

SENATOR WAS.

00:45:55.152 --> 00:45:59.523
UP -- I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS.

00:45:59.590 --> 00:46:02.860
IN THE COMMITTEES ANALYSIS.

00:46:02.926 --> 00:46:07.264
THERE WAS -- REFERENCE TO OF A

00:46:07.331 --> 00:46:08.265
PILOT PROGRAM.

00:46:08.332 --> 00:46:12.236
THAT GOES UNTIL JANUARY OF

00:46:12.302 --> 00:46:12.903
TWENTY TWENTY FOUR AND IF I

00:46:12.970 --> 00:46:14.771
UNDERSTAND THIS RIGHT.

00:46:14.838 --> 00:46:16.006
THERE WAS THERE'S A GRAPH THERE

00:46:16.073 --> 00:46:18.008
I THINK IT'S A PAGE.

00:46:18.075 --> 00:46:20.611
FOUR OF THAT COMPARES THE PILOT

00:46:20.677 --> 00:46:23.680
PROGRAM WITH THIS BILL AND

00:46:23.747 --> 00:46:24.848
COMMENTS.

00:46:24.915 --> 00:46:26.550
AS TO THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN

00:46:26.617 --> 00:46:30.787
THE PILOT PROGRAM AND THE BILL --

00:46:30.854 --> 00:46:36.493
AND THERE ARE.

00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:38.929
THERE ARE TWO AREAS IN WHICH THE

00:46:38.996 --> 00:46:41.832
REQUIREMENTS ARE IDENTICAL SO IT

00:46:41.899 --> 00:46:43.267
DOESN'T DO ANYTHING.

00:46:43.333 --> 00:46:44.868
TO IMPROVE.

00:46:44.935 --> 00:46:48.572
OF THE PILOT PROGRAM.

00:46:48.639 --> 00:46:50.741
THERE'S ACTUALLY TWO AREAS WERE

00:46:50.807 --> 00:46:52.176
SAYS A PILOT PROGRAM

00:46:52.242 --> 00:46:53.844
REQUIREMENTS ARE MORE.

00:46:53.911 --> 00:46:56.013
RIGOROUS WHICH I TAKE TO MEAN

00:46:56.079 --> 00:47:00.050
GOOD ON THE SIDE OF THE CONSUMER --

00:47:00.117 --> 00:47:01.718
AND THEN THERE'S ONE WHERE IT

00:47:01.785 --> 00:47:04.154
SAYS IT'S BASICALLY AYE

00:47:04.221 --> 00:47:06.657
IDENTICAL TO THE PILOT PROGRAM

00:47:06.723 --> 00:47:07.291
SO.

00:47:07.357 --> 00:47:13.163
IT ALMOST FEELS LIKE -- THIS IS

00:47:13.230 --> 00:47:15.632
WORSE THAN THE OR OR NOT DOING

00:47:15.699 --> 00:47:17.367
ANY BETTER IN SOME CASES WORSE

00:47:17.434 --> 00:47:18.802
THAN.

00:47:18.869 --> 00:47:20.037
THE PILOT PROGRAM SO.

00:47:20.103 --> 00:47:21.805
WHY?

00:47:21.872 --> 00:47:24.074
WHY GO IN THAT DIRECTION RIGHT

00:47:24.141 --> 00:47:27.244
WELL WE'RE TRYING TO IMPROVE --

00:47:27.311 --> 00:47:29.279
AND PROTECT THE CONSUMER WHY GO

00:47:29.346 --> 00:47:31.014
IN THAT DIRECTION INSTEAD OF

00:47:31.081 --> 00:47:33.617
STRENGTHENING THE PROTECTIONS AS

00:47:33.684 --> 00:47:37.287
AT FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE

00:47:37.354 --> 00:47:39.890
PILOT PROGRAM I JUST WANNA.

00:47:39.957 --> 00:47:41.558
MAKE IT VERY CLEAR THAT THIS

00:47:41.625 --> 00:47:43.260
BILL DOES NOT AMEND THE PILOT

00:47:43.327 --> 00:47:44.261
PROGRAM.

00:47:44.328 --> 00:47:46.496
THE PILOT PROGRAM IN THIS BILL

00:47:46.563 --> 00:47:48.198
ARE TWO SEPARATE THINGS.

00:47:48.265 --> 00:47:49.766
THE COMPARISON WITH THE PILOT

00:47:49.833 --> 00:47:51.868
PROGRAM JUST SAYING WITHIN ONE

00:47:51.935 --> 00:47:54.304
SPECIFIC CAR PILOT PROGRAM THAT

00:47:54.371 --> 00:47:56.573
SET TO SUNSET.

00:47:56.640 --> 00:47:58.308
THERE THEY ARE THESE OTHER

00:47:58.375 --> 00:47:59.943
COMPARISONS.

00:48:00.010 --> 00:48:01.511
I DON'T KNOW HOW WELL IT CAN BE

00:48:01.578 --> 00:48:03.580
FAIR IN THE SENSE THAT THESE --

00:48:03.647 --> 00:48:05.582
PROVISIONS ARE BEINGTESTED

00:48:05.649 --> 00:48:06.917
CURRENTLY UNDER THE PILOT

00:48:06.984 --> 00:48:08.785
PROGRAM BUT THE PILOT PROGRAM IS

00:48:08.852 --> 00:48:10.854
A VERY DIFFERENT PROGRAM THAN

00:48:10.921 --> 00:48:11.688
THIS PROGRAM.

00:48:11.755 --> 00:48:15.859
THE PILOT PROGRAM DOES NOT.

00:48:15.926 --> 00:48:17.694
COVER ALL THE PEOPLE THAT.

00:48:17.761 --> 00:48:19.062
LENDING COVERS IN GENERAL.

00:48:19.129 --> 00:48:21.565
PILOT PROGRAMS VERY SPECIFIC SO

00:48:21.632 --> 00:48:22.766
I WANT TO KIND OF ADD.

00:48:22.833 --> 00:48:26.403
OF A 100% PEOPLE -- TO LOOKING

00:48:26.470 --> 00:48:28.105
FOR LOANS PILOT PROGRAM OWNS

00:48:28.171 --> 00:48:30.641
ONLY COVERS A VERY SMALL

00:48:30.707 --> 00:48:31.808
PERCENTAGE OF THAT.

00:48:31.875 --> 00:48:33.243
WE CAN START WITH A CONVENTIONAL

00:48:33.310 --> 00:48:34.678
BANK ABOUT CONVENTIONAL BANK

00:48:34.745 --> 00:48:37.581
GIVES LOANS TO ONLY IF YOU'RE A

00:48:37.648 --> 00:48:39.583
BUSINESS IF YOU'RE AN INDIVIDUAL.

00:48:39.650 --> 00:48:42.319
LESS THAN TH -- UP ABOUT 10% OF

00:48:42.386 --> 00:48:43.587
OF THE BUSINESSES THAT ACTUALLY

00:48:43.654 --> 00:48:44.888
LOOK FOR A LOAN FROM A BANK

00:48:44.955 --> 00:48:46.223
ACTUALLY GET THEM THAT'S ONLY

00:48:46.290 --> 00:48:48.392
10% THAT LEAVES OUT 90% OF THE

00:48:48.458 --> 00:48:49.559
PEOPLE THAT ARE ELIGIBLE FOR

00:48:49.626 --> 00:48:52.229
LONG WE CAN GET IT. FOR A A FOR

00:48:52.296 --> 00:48:53.964
PEOPLE TO LESS THAN THAT.

00:48:54.031 --> 00:48:56.233
SO A LOT OF PEOPLE IN OUR STATE

00:48:56.300 --> 00:48:57.100
OUR OWN BANKED.

00:48:57.167 --> 00:48:59.436
OR HAVE NO CREDIT OR HAVE A VERY

00:48:59.503 --> 00:49:01.338
VERY BAD CREDIT.

00:49:01.405 --> 00:49:03.907
AND AND AND ONE OF THE THINGS

00:49:03.974 --> 00:49:06.043
THAT HAPPENS IN A IN AN

00:49:06.109 --> 00:49:07.210
ENVIRONMENT WHERE USE THAT.

00:49:07.277 --> 00:49:09.680
INTEREST RATE LIMITS IS THAT YOU

00:49:09.746 --> 00:49:11.782
BASICALLY MAKE AN ENTIRE -- A

00:49:11.848 --> 00:49:13.150
VERY LARGE PERCENTAGE OF YOUR

00:49:13.216 --> 00:49:16.486
POPULATION THAT HAS NO ACCESS TO

00:49:16.553 --> 00:49:17.921
ANY KIND OF CREDIT.

00:49:17.988 --> 00:49:20.090
IF THEY HAVE VERY POOR CREDIT

00:49:20.157 --> 00:49:21.391
AND THEY ARE HAVE BEEN

00:49:21.458 --> 00:49:24.127
COMPLETELY OMITTED FROM.

00:49:24.194 --> 00:49:25.896
THE THE LENDING MARKET HOW DO

00:49:25.962 --> 00:49:28.332
YOU RE ESTABLISH CREDIT HOW DO

00:49:28.398 --> 00:49:30.400
YOU GET ACCESS TO CAPITAL IF YOU

00:49:30.467 --> 00:49:31.868
HAVE A STATE.

00:49:31.935 --> 00:49:34.471
THAT DOES NOT ALLOW THERE TO BE

00:49:34.538 --> 00:49:35.405
SOME KIND OF LENDER THAT ALLOWS

00:49:35.472 --> 00:49:35.739
THAT.

00:49:35.806 --> 00:49:38.442
SO FIRST SOME INDIVIDUALS THEIR

00:49:38.508 --> 00:49:43.246
pTHAT THESE INDIVIDUALS NOT HAVE

00:49:43.313 --> 00:49:44.247
ACCESS TO CREDIT.

00:49:44.314 --> 00:49:46.049
AND TO HAVE ACCESS TO HIGH

00:49:46.116 --> 00:49:47.584
INTEREST RATE CREDIT. FOR THAT

00:49:47.651 --> 00:49:49.086
THE INDIVIDUALS THAT DO HAVE

00:49:49.152 --> 00:49:50.754
ACCESS TO HIGH INTEREST CREDIT A

00:49:50.821 --> 00:49:52.989
LOT OF THEM REPAY THOSE LOANS

00:49:53.056 --> 00:49:56.893
AND AND ARE GIVEN -- ARE ARE ARE

00:49:56.960 --> 00:49:58.495
ABLE TO REESTABLISH CREDIT. FOR

00:49:58.562 --> 00:49:59.429
THE ONES THAT ARE NOT.

00:49:59.496 --> 00:50:01.064
WHAT USED TO HAPPEN BEFORE IS

00:50:01.131 --> 00:50:02.666
PEOPLE WOULD GO TO THE BLACK

00:50:02.733 --> 00:50:04.067
MARKET FOR CREDIT?

00:50:04.134 --> 00:50:06.870
AND AND THEN WE'RE HERE STOCK AS

00:50:06.937 --> 00:50:08.705
LEGISLATORS.

00:50:08.772 --> 00:50:10.474
IN THE POSITION OF DECIDING.

00:50:10.540 --> 00:50:12.342
WHAT DO I PREFERRED THAT WE WE

00:50:12.409 --> 00:50:13.744
HAVE PEOPLE THAT ARE DEFAULTING

00:50:13.810 --> 00:50:14.678
ON THOSE ARE PEOPLE THEY'RE

00:50:14.745 --> 00:50:16.012
GETTING THEIR KNEES BROKEN

00:50:16.079 --> 00:50:18.148
BECAUSE THEY THEY?

00:50:18.215 --> 00:50:19.349
ARE NOT PAYING THEM.

00:50:19.416 --> 00:50:20.484
AND AND THOSE ARE REAL

00:50:20.550 --> 00:50:21.485
SITUATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN --

00:50:21.551 --> 00:50:22.586
THAT HAVE EXISTED IN OUR

00:50:22.652 --> 00:50:24.154
COMMUNITY BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE

00:50:24.221 --> 00:50:25.255
GOING TO THE BLACK MARKET FOR

00:50:25.322 --> 00:50:26.223
LOANS.

00:50:26.289 --> 00:50:30.193
OUT OF DESPERATION AND WHAT WHAT

00:50:30.260 --> 00:50:30.794
WHAT CAN WE DO TO RESPOND TO

00:50:30.861 --> 00:50:31.828
THAT.

00:50:31.895 --> 00:50:34.097
WE CAN WE CAN WHAT WITHOUT

00:50:34.164 --> 00:50:36.733
CUTTING ACCESS TO TO LOANS YEAH

00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:38.335
WE NEED TO EDUCATE.

00:50:38.402 --> 00:50:39.836
MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WHICH THIS

00:50:39.903 --> 00:50:42.406
BILL DOES ABOUT ACCESSING HIGH

00:50:42.472 --> 00:50:44.641
INTEREST RATES WE HAVE TO CREATE

00:50:44.708 --> 00:50:46.643
ALTERNATIVE PROGRAMS WHICH THE

00:50:46.710 --> 00:50:47.911
PILOT PROGRAMS BUT IT

00:50:47.978 --> 00:50:49.112
UNDERSTANDING THAT THOSE

00:50:49.179 --> 00:50:50.814
PROGRAMS.

00:50:50.881 --> 00:50:53.617
DO NOT HELP THE PEOPLE.

00:50:53.683 --> 00:50:55.452
THAT ARE.

00:50:55.519 --> 00:50:56.686
GET ACCESS TO CREDIT SO HOW DO

00:50:56.753 --> 00:50:57.888
WE HELP THE PEOPLE THAT

CREDIT OR DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO

00:51:01.024 --> 00:51:01.825

00:51:01.892 --> 00:51:03.860
THAT PROVIDE THEM CREDIT UNDER

00:51:03.927 --> 00:51:05.061
THIRTY SIX OR UNDER FORTY UNDER

00:51:05.128 --> 00:51:07.798
FIFTY OR UNDER 30% OR UNDER 20%.

00:51:07.864 --> 00:51:09.533
HOW DO WE HELP THEM?

00:51:09.599 --> 00:51:11.334
AND AND I DON'T BELIEVE THAT WE

00:51:11.401 --> 00:51:13.136
HELP THEM BY ELIMINATING ALL

00:51:13.203 --> 00:51:14.771
SOURCES TO CREDIT.

00:51:14.838 --> 00:51:16.740
BUT THERE ARE THINGS THAT WE CAN

00:51:16.807 --> 00:51:19.109
DO I MEAN I'M I'M I'M TRYING TO

00:51:19.176 --> 00:51:20.277
CREATE A BUILT.

00:51:20.343 --> 00:51:21.778
THAT CREATES A STATE BANK I'M

00:51:21.845 --> 00:51:24.414
TRYING -- TO PROVIDE FINANCIAL

00:51:24.481 --> 00:51:28.251
LITERACY I'M TRYING -- TO FIND

00:51:28.318 --> 00:51:30.320
WAYS TO HELP I HAVE A A BILL

00:51:30.387 --> 00:51:33.256
THAT ALSO HELPS PEOPLE WHEN THEY

00:51:33.323 --> 00:51:36.626
OF WHEN THEY ARE PAY THE RENT.

00:51:36.693 --> 00:51:38.295
IF THE RENT PAY THE RENT ON THE

00:51:38.361 --> 00:51:39.729
CHIMNEY BASIS HELP SOME

ESTABLISH CREDIT.

00:51:40.797 --> 00:51:42.132
THEY'RE ALL THESE THINGS THAT WE

00:51:42.199 --> 00:51:43.567
CAN DO TO HELP PEOPLE TO STAFF

00:51:43.633 --> 00:51:44.968
LEVELS SELFLESS CREDIT IF YOU

00:51:45.035 --> 00:51:47.204

LOANS BUT FOR VERY HIGH AMOUNTS.

BANKRUPTCY SO.

00:54:28.064 --> 00:54:29.633
IT MIGHT MIKE.

00:54:29.699 --> 00:54:32.836
MY BILL MAKES IT HARDER. FOR

00:54:32.902 --> 00:54:34.471
THESE LENDERS TO REPOSSESS

00:54:34.537 --> 00:54:36.740
VEHICLES IT GIVES.

00:54:36.806 --> 00:54:38.608
PEOPLE THAT WERE -- THAT MADE A

00:54:38.675 --> 00:54:43.580
DECISION OVER A MOMENTS -- YOU

00:54:43.647 --> 00:54:50.920
KNOW -- OTHER BY I MEAN HOW CAN

00:54:50.987 --> 00:54:52.355
ANY OF THESE GROUPS THAT

00:54:52.422 --> 00:54:54.224
ADVOCATE FOR CONSUMERS COME COME

00:54:54.290 --> 00:54:56.660
HERE TO THIS FORUM AND SAY I'M

00:54:56.726 --> 00:55:00.163
OPPOSED. TO A LIST OF CONSUMER

00:55:00.230 --> 00:55:01.498
PROTECTIONS.

00:55:01.564 --> 00:55:04.134
SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY'RE OPPOSED

00:55:04.200 --> 00:55:06.102
TO WHAT THE BILL DOESN'T DO.

00:55:06.169 --> 00:55:08.672
AND THAT'S LET LET'S I I I THINK

00:55:08.738 --> 00:55:10.040
HERE I THINK THE THE WHAT THEY'D

00:55:10.106 --> 00:55:13.176
LIKE TO SEE IS A CAP ON INTEREST

00:55:13.243 --> 00:55:13.777
RATE LOS WE HAVE ANOTHER BILL

00:55:13.843 --> 00:55:14.644
THAT DOES THAT.

00:55:14.711 --> 00:55:16.546
AND AND THIS BILL DOES NOT

00:55:16.613 --> 00:55:17.747
CONFLICT WITH THAT.

00:55:17.814 --> 00:55:19.382
ONE AND SO DO YOU CAN APPROVE

00:55:19.449 --> 00:55:20.850
THIS BILL IF YOU LIKE THE OTHER

00:55:20.917 --> 00:55:22.752
BILL THAT PROPOSES A CAP YOU CAN

00:55:22.819 --> 00:55:24.421
YOU CAN GO FOR THAT ONE AS WELL

00:55:24.487 --> 00:55:26.222
BUT THESE ARE NOT.

00:55:26.289 --> 00:55:27.924
BILLS A CONFLICT WITH EACH OTHER.

00:55:27.991 --> 00:55:30.026
BUT IT IS IT'S UP TO YOU FOR FOR

00:55:30.093 --> 00:55:31.394
MY TASTE.

00:55:31.461 --> 00:55:32.996
I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS

00:55:33.063 --> 00:55:34.264
THAT WE CAN DO TO HELP.

00:55:34.330 --> 00:55:35.899
PEOPLE THAT CAN ACCESS ACCESS TO

00:55:35.965 --> 00:55:37.267
CHEAPER CREDIT INCLUDING

00:55:37.333 --> 00:55:38.868
SUPPORTING PROGRAMS BUT LET'S BE

00:55:38.935 --> 00:55:40.336
HONEST.

00:55:40.403 --> 00:55:42.372
PROVIDING ACCESS TO CAPITAL IS

00:55:42.439 --> 00:55:43.873
VERY EXPENSIVE AND FOR THE

00:55:43.940 --> 00:55:44.841
PEOPLE THAT DO IT IT'S VERY

00:55:44.908 --> 00:55:45.975
RISKY.

00:55:46.042 --> 00:55:48.011
AND THEY'RE NOT GONNA DO IT IF

00:55:48.078 --> 00:55:51.514
IF THEY'RE GOING TO BE PROVIDING --

00:55:51.581 --> 00:55:56.686
RISKY LOANS. TO A OF A CROSS

00:55:56.753 --> 00:55:58.154
SECTION OF THE COMMUNITY THAT

00:55:58.221 --> 00:56:00.857
CAN AFFORD TO REPAY THEM OR HAS

00:56:00.924 --> 00:56:02.358
A LIKELY THAT THEY WON'T REPAY

00:56:02.425 --> 00:56:03.860
THEM IS JUST NOT GOING TO HAPPEN

00:56:03.927 --> 00:56:06.329
AND IT'S A AND THAT THAT PROGRAM.

00:56:06.396 --> 00:56:07.864
WHAT DO YOU LIKE IT OR NOT?

00:56:07.931 --> 00:56:09.065
IT'S GOING TO DRY UP OF FOR THE

00:56:09.132 --> 00:56:10.967
PEOPLE THAT DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO

00:56:11.034 --> 00:56:11.601
THAT.

00:56:11.668 --> 00:56:13.103
WHETHER THEY HAVE A ROOF ABILITY

00:56:13.169 --> 00:56:14.871
REPAIR OR OR PEPPER NOT IT

00:56:14.938 --> 00:56:16.306
DOESN'T MATTER BECAUSE IT WILL

00:56:16.372 --> 00:56:17.407
NOT EXIST.

00:56:17.474 --> 00:56:18.842
AND FOR THE PEOPLE THAT IT DID

00:56:18.908 --> 00:56:21.711
IT IS CURRENTLY SERVING

00:56:21.778 --> 00:56:22.645
SUCCESSFULLY.

00:56:22.712 --> 00:56:23.513
THEY WON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THAT

00:56:23.580 --> 00:56:24.781
SO WHERE WILL THEY GO WHERE WE

00:56:24.848 --> 00:56:26.516
SEND THEM.

00:56:26.583 --> 00:56:30.487
WELL THANK THE COURT HAD CENTER --

00:56:30.553 --> 00:56:31.821
I WAS JUSTASKING ABOUT THE

00:56:31.888 --> 00:56:33.857
COMPARISON BETWEEN THE TWO BUT

00:56:33.923 --> 00:56:35.892
SINCE YOU RAISE THE ISSUE OF THE

00:56:35.959 --> 00:56:39.095
PERCENTAGE OF YOU KNOW ONON

00:56:39.162 --> 00:56:41.431
LOANS -- THAT BOTHERS ME EVEN

00:56:41.498 --> 00:56:44.334
MORE THAT WORRIES ME EVEN MORE.

00:56:44.400 --> 00:56:46.703
I BEEN AROUND FOR COMMUNITIES

00:56:46.770 --> 00:56:48.171
AND WORKING CLASS COMMUNITIES MY

00:56:48.238 --> 00:56:49.506
ENTIRE LIFE.

00:56:49.572 --> 00:56:52.408
AND THE THE PROBLEM I THINK HERE

00:56:52.475 --> 00:56:54.177
IF IF THIS IS.

00:56:54.244 --> 00:56:56.579
AS CONNECTED AS YOU EAT YOU SAID

00:56:56.646 --> 00:56:58.214
WHICH WAS NOT MY QUESTION.

00:56:58.281 --> 00:57:00.316
BUT YOU'RE SAYING THIS BASICALLY

00:57:00.383 --> 00:57:03.219
LEADS TO WE NEED COMPANIES.

00:57:03.286 --> 00:57:05.155
WHO CAN LOAN MONEY TO POOR

00:57:05.221 --> 00:57:08.758
PEOPLE AND IT ALMOST DOESN'T

00:57:08.825 --> 00:57:09.359
MATTER WHAT THEY CHARGE THEM?

00:57:09.425 --> 00:57:10.560
I DON'T THINK BECAUSE SOMEONE IS

00:57:10.627 --> 00:57:11.494
POOR.

00:57:11.561 --> 00:57:12.695
THAT A COMPANY SHOULD HAVE THE

00:57:12.762 --> 00:57:14.464
RIGHT TO GOUGE THEM AND CHARGE

00:57:14.531 --> 00:57:15.865
WHATEVER THEY WANT.

00:57:15.932 --> 00:57:17.167
WE WOULDN'T DO THAT IN A

00:57:17.233 --> 00:57:18.501
HOSPITAL SAID SOMEBODY GOES TO

00:57:18.568 --> 00:57:22.172
THE HOSPITAL WE WOULD NOT ALLOW.

00:57:22.238 --> 00:57:23.706
THAT HOSPITAL TO CHARGE.

00:57:23.773 --> 00:57:25.809
WHATEVER THAT WHATEVER WHATEVER

00:57:25.875 --> 00:57:27.777
THEY WHEN IT'S HAPPENING NOW.

00:57:27.844 --> 00:57:29.245
WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW WORST STOP

00:57:29.312 --> 00:57:30.914
WHEN WE HAVE SOME THINGS IN

00:57:30.980 --> 00:57:33.449
PLACE -- WE HAVE SOME THINGS IN

00:57:33.516 --> 00:57:35.451
PLACE HI BU YOU KNOW THE THE

00:57:35.518 --> 00:57:37.153
DOESN'T MEAN BECAUSE SOMEBODY IS

00:57:37.220 --> 00:57:38.621
POOR THE YOU GONNA TAKE

00:57:38.688 --> 00:57:39.889
ADVANTAGE OF THEM.

00:57:39.956 --> 00:57:41.558
AND THAT'S WHAT'S TAKING PLACE

00:57:41.624 --> 00:57:44.561
IS COMPLETE ADVANTAGE OF POOR

00:57:44.627 --> 00:57:46.963
PEOPLE ALREADY POOR AND WE'RE

00:57:47.030 --> 00:57:48.932
GOING TO WORSEN THE CYCLE OF

00:57:48.998 --> 00:57:51.167
POVERTY SO I I GUESS I'M ONLY

00:57:51.234 --> 00:57:54.170
RESPONDING WITH THAT BECAUSE YOU

00:57:54.237 --> 00:57:55.672
YOU MADE A CASE FOR IT.

00:57:55.738 --> 00:57:57.941
I WAS SIMPLY TRYING TO SAY THE

00:57:58.007 --> 00:57:59.742
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE BILL AND

00:57:59.809 --> 00:58:02.612
THE PILOT PROGRAM DIDN'T APPEAR

00:58:02.679 --> 00:58:03.246
TO HAVE.

00:58:03.313 --> 00:58:06.149
YOU KNOW OF ANYTHING THAT WAS

00:58:06.216 --> 00:58:09.185

00:58:09.252 --> 00:58:12.388
ASKING -- FOR AND LSO ARE THERE

00:58:12.455 --> 00:58:15.291

00:58:22.665 --> 00:58:24.500
YOU KNOW I'M IF WE'RE IF IT'S A

00:58:24.567 --> 00:58:26.469
CONSUMER PROTECTION WE DON'T

00:58:26.536 --> 00:58:27.604
HAVE ANY CONSUMER GROUPS THAT

00:58:27.670 --> 00:58:29.906
ARE SUPPORTIVE AGAIN IT'S UP TO

00:58:29.973 --> 00:58:31.374
YOU TO DECIDE IF THIS IS A

00:58:31.441 --> 00:58:32.942
CONSUMER PROTECTION.

00:58:33.009 --> 00:58:33.943
CONSUMER PROTECTION.

00:58:34.010 --> 00:58:36.179
I THESE ARE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS

00:58:36.246 --> 00:58:40.817
I'VE.

00:58:40.884 --> 00:58:42.018
I'VE RECEIVED A 100%.

00:58:42.085 --> 00:58:43.419
OF WITH CONSUMER FEDS SINCE I'VE

BEEN HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE THE

00:58:44.153 --> 00:58:44.921
THESE ARE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS

00:58:44.988 --> 00:58:47.056
BUT AGAIN THE CONCERN AS WELL

00:58:47.123 --> 00:58:48.625
HE'S NOT ELIMINATE HE'S NOT

00:58:48.691 --> 00:58:49.826
CREATE A CAP.

00:58:49.893 --> 00:58:51.594
ON THE INTEREST RATE IN THIS

00:58:51.661 --> 00:58:52.462
BILL AND THAT'S A DIFFERENT

00:58:52.528 --> 00:58:53.129
THING AGAIN.

00:58:53.196 --> 00:58:55.765
IF WE SEPARATE THAT IS THIS A

00:58:55.832 --> 00:58:57.300
CONSUMER PROTECTION BILL

00:58:57.367 --> 00:58:58.701
ABSOLUTELY I MEAN.

00:58:58.768 --> 00:59:00.803
ANYBODY COULD SEE THAT THIS IS

00:59:00.870 --> 00:59:03.172
IMPOSING REQUIREMENTS TO PROTECT

00:59:03.239 --> 00:59:05.108
THE CONSUMER I'VE LISTED WHAT

00:59:05.174 --> 00:59:06.276
THEY ARE.

00:59:06.342 --> 00:59:07.577
AND THERE ARE WONDERFUL

00:59:07.644 --> 00:59:11.547
PROTECTIONS BUT AGAIN I ALSO

00:59:11.614 --> 00:59:12.782
WANT TO CLARIFY LOOK.

00:59:12.849 --> 00:59:13.416
THEY THEY SHOULD BE IN SUPPORT

00:59:13.483 --> 00:59:14.584
OF THIS BECAUSE IT IS CONSUMER

00:59:14.651 --> 00:59:15.852
PROTECTION IT'S MOVING IN THE

00:59:15.919 --> 00:59:17.687
RIGHT DIRECTION DOES IT PROVIDED

00:59:17.754 --> 00:59:19.188
EVERYTHING THEY WANT TO SEE IT

00:59:19.255 --> 00:59:22.425
DOESN'T BECAUSE I I I AGAIN I

BECAUSE THEY'RE POOR AND I JUST

00:59:31.034 --> 00:59:32.201
WANT TO CREATE THE DISTINCTION

00:59:32.268 --> 00:59:33.369
THAT'S HAPPENING TO THEM BECAUSE

00:59:33.436 --> 00:59:34.470
THEY DON'T HAVE CREDIT WHERE

00:59:34.537 --> 00:59:36.039
THEY HAVE VERY BAD CREDIT OR

00:59:36.105 --> 00:59:37.407
HAVE THEY HAVE A HISTORY.

00:59:37.473 --> 00:59:39.175
OF NOT PAYING BACK LOANS OR
