SKINNER IF YOU HAVE ANY OPENING REMARKS YOU MAY DO SO NOW. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- CHAIR RUBIO AND I'M REALLY APPRECIATIVE OF. YOUR ORGANIZING THIS TODAY BECAUSE- THESE ISSUES ARE VERY IMPORTANT AND UNFORTUNATELY I THINK ALL OF US HAVE MONITORED THE FACT THAT DURING THE PANDEMIC. INCIDENTS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WERE ON THE RICE AND OBVIOUSLY THE- THIS WHOLE EXPERIENCE OF HAVING OUR LIVES SO DISTRACTED WITH SHUTDOWNS AND NOT GOING TO SCHOOL OR WORK HAS PUT PRESSURE. ON EVERYONE AND SO FOR THE CHILL OUT FOR CHILDREN WHO ARE HERE UNDER THE PRESSURE AND THEN MAYBE IN A HOUSEHOLD WHERE THERE IS DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. THE CONSEQUENCES ARE GREAT AND YET WE ALSO KNOW THAT. I'M NOT NOT. OFTEN OR NOT THE NORM BUT- OUR CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM IN TRYING TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF THE CHILDREN CAN SOMETIMES NOT HAVE PLACEMENTS THAT REALLY. DO THE BEST FOR THEM AND SO WE WANT TO REALLY MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE ADDRESSING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ADDRESSING CHILD WELFARE AND DOING THE BEST FOR ALL PARTIES CONCERNED SIR I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR SETTING THIS UP THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH SENATOR SKINNER- YOU KNOW AS SHE STATED IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE FOCUS ON THE WHOLE PICTURE- I KNOW I'VE BEEN A STRONG ADVOCATE AS WELL AS SENATOR SKIN ON DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND- PUSHING POLICIES. AND CHILDREN AS WELL BUT NOW WE WANT TO SEE HOW WE CAN STRENGTHEN. POLICIES TO HELP THOSE CAUGHT IN LIMBO AND CHILDREN HAVE TO BE IN THE CENTER OF THIS CONVERSATION SO I REALLY APPRECIATE THE PANELISTS THAT ARE GOING TO BRING US. INFORMATION BUT ALSO SOME RECOMMENDATIONS I LOOK FORWARD TO THAT- BEFORE WE BEGIN WITH OUR FIRST SPEAKER I WOULD LIKE TO INVITE THE PUBLIC WANTING TO PARTICIPATE TO CALL IN NOW. PLEASE DIAL THE TOLL FREE NUMBER. 844-291-5489 AND ENTER THE ACCESS CODE TWO THREE FIVE FIVE THREE FOUR THREE TO BE ADDED TO THE WAITING LIST AT THIS TIME. R. NOW LET'S- GO TO OUR FIRST PRESENTER- WHICH I'M EXCITED TO HEAR FROM ANYA EMERSON WITH THE FAMILY VIOLENCE A PILOT PROJECT AN ORGANIZATION WHICH IS DEDICATED TO HELPING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SURVIVORS AND THEIR CHILDREN APPEAL DANGEROUS TRIAL COURT DECISIONS. ON THEIR BEHALF FOR FREE I WE WILL NOW MOVE TO OUR FIRST PRESENTER MISTER EMERSON THE FLOOR IS YOURS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATORS RUBIO AND SENATOR SKINNER IT'S AN HONOR TO BE HERE AND TO BE PRESENTING TO THE COMMITTEE ON THIS VERY VERY IMPORTANT TOPIC. MY NAME IS ON THE HORIZON I'M AN ATTORNEY ADMITTED IN BOTH CALIFORNIA AND NEW YORK. I CURRENTLY HAVE MY OWN SOLO LAW PRACTICE AFTER YEARS SPECIALISING IN FAMILY LAW AND DEPENDENCY IN THOSE STATES. HOWEVER I AM HERE TODAY TESTIFYING IN MY CAPACITY AS A MEMBER OF THE DEPENDENCY ADVISORY PANEL. OF THE FAMILY VIOLENCE HELLO PROJECT. AND I WANT TO ADDRESS THREE THINGS IN MY TESTIMONY TODAY. THE FIRST IS THAT I'VE BEEN ASKED BY COMMITTEE STAFF. TO GIVE A VERY BRIEF OVERVIEW. OF WHAT I DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. NO MORE COMPLICATED. I'M THAT MANY PEOPLE THINK THE SECOND IS ALL EXPLAIN WHAT MY ORGANIZATION DOES THE FAMILY VIOLENCE A PILOT PROJECT AND THIRD OF ALL ADDRESS SOME REAL ISSUES THAT WE SEE IN THE CURRENT DEPENDENCY SYSTEM IN CHILD WELFARE. SO TO BEGIN WITH- I DON'T THINK ANYONE AT THIS HEARING NEEDS TO BE TOLD THAT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS NOT A HUGE PROBLEM ONE IN FOUR WOMEN WILL EXPERIENCE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IN THEIR LIFETIMES ONE IN SEVEN MEN AND ONE IN THREE WOMEN EVERY DAY IN THE UNITED STATES ARE MURDERED BY THEIR INTIMATE PARTNERS. DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ALSO HAS VERY SERIOUS SEVERE EFFECTS ON CHILDREN WHICH I WILL NOT GO INTO BUT I THINK ONE OF THE LEADERS ANALYSTS WELL- BUT WHAT IS DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IT'S MORE COMPLICATED THAN VIOLENCE- MANY. PEOPLE THINK OF IT AS A WOMAN WITH A BLACK. BUT IT'S MORE THAN IT'S SYSTEM HOW AND CONTROL. BUT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CAN OCCUR IN ANY RELATIONSHIP NO MATTER PERSON'S GENDER RACE CLASS OR TYPE OF RELATIONSHIP. WE MOST ABUSERS ARE MEN AND MOST VICTIMS ARE OR SURVIVORS ARE WOMEN AT WHICH MEANS I WILL USE THAT MALE PRONOUN FOR ABUSE AND THAT FEMALE PRONOUN FOR SURVIVOR BUT THAT IS NOT BY NO MEANS NOT ALWAYS THE CASE. AT ITS HEART THE MASTER VIOLENCE IS ABOUT POWER AND CONTROL BY THE VIEWS ARE OVER THE VICTOR AND THIS CAN TAKE MANY FORMS IT CAN BE PHYSICAL VIOLENCE- STRANGULATION IS PARTICULARLY DANGEROUS BECAUSE THAT'S OFTEN AN INDICATOR OF FUTURE LEGALITY. RECKLESS DRIVING AND BRANDISHING FIREARMS ARE REALLY VERY DANGEROUS AS WELL A MOTIONAL ABUSE CALLING THE VICTIMS DEROGATORY NAMES TELL THEM NOTHING SHE CAN DO IS EVER RIGHT THE FOOD SHE COOKED IS TERRIBLE THE HOUSE IS A MAX. FINANCIAL ABUSE I'M TAKING A PAYCHECK AWAY PROHIBITING THEM FROM REQUIRED FROM WORKING OR REQUIRING ADDICTIONS WORK RUINING THE VICTIM'S CREDIT TAKING OUT CREDIT CARDS IN HER NAME SLASHING THE TIRES SO SHE CAN'T GET TO WORK. GIVING A BREAKDOWN AND ALLOWANCE OR NO MONEY AT ALL A RECURRING RECEIPTS FOR ALL PURCHASES ARE THREATENING EMPLOYMENT TAKING WAY PASSWORDS TO BANK ACCOUNTS THOSE ARE ALL VERY COMMON SEXUAL ABUSE. RAPE OR REQUIRING A VICTIM SHOE ACCIDENT SEXUAL ACTS SHE'S NOT COMFORTABLE WITH. OF COURSE A BIG TIME TO SEND AN ABUSER PHOTOGRAPHS OR VIDEOS OF A SEXUAL NATURE AND THEN USING THOSE LATER AS BLACKMAIL. OR ANOTHER OR PUBLISHING. DO YOU THAT YOU OUR REALLY OR FIGURES WORK. PRECEPTS TO EITHER PREVENT A THEM FROM LEAVING OR TO REINFORCE AND USER OF. AND JENNA ROLE YOU USE TELLING THE THAT GOOD WITH DO AT OR Y. OR N. L. RELATIONS. THREATENING TO REVEAL SEXUAL ORIENTATION OR PREFERRED GENDER. LEGAL AND THIS MAY COME UP LATER IN THIS HEARING I USED FOR GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES DATA. AND USERS WILL OFTEN CALL THE POLICE ON THE VICTIM. THEY'LL CALL CHILD PROTECTIVE SERVICES ON THE VICTIM GET A VICTIM OF VICTIM FROM HOUSING. HEY MIKE TRYING GET A VICTIM DEPORTED BY CALLING IMMIGRATION CONTRACEPTIVE ABUSE REQUIRE A BIG DOWN TO OBTAIN PERMISSION TO OBTAIN MEDICAL CARE OR PREVENTING. FROM OBTAINING MEDICAL CARE OR SABOTAGING OR FORCING CONTRACEPTIVE USE. OF SOCIAL ISOLATION CUTTING THE VICTIM OFF FROM FAMILY AND FRIENDS LITERALLY PREVENTING VICTIMS FROM LEAVING THE HOUSE TAKING AWAY CAR KEYS HOUSE KEYS CELLPHONES. AND TECHNOLOGICAL ABUSE TRACKING THEM AT ALL TIMES GPS TRACKERS CELLPHONES MONITORING EMAIL COMMUNICATION- REQUIRING SHE HAND OVER ALL PASSWORDS AND FINALLY ABUSE OF CHILDREN OR CATS WHICH IS OFTEN ANOTHER INDICATOR VERY SEVERE ABUSE I THINK I MAY NOT LEAVE AN ABUSER FOR FEAR OF WHAT HE WILL DO CHILDREN ARE PACKS A BIG MISTAKE BECAUSE SHE BELIEVES THAT. ALTERNATELY SAFER. NO VISIBLE- VIOLENCE THAT'S OFTEN THE MOST VISIBLE FORM OF ABUSE. VICTIMS OFTEN REPORT THAT IT'S THE OTHER TYPES OF ISSUES THAT ARE ACTUALLY HARDER TO OVERCOME. A MOTIONAL ABUSE CAN BE VERY PSYCHOLOGICALLY DAMAGING. AND THEN SIMPLE THINGS LIKE BAD CREDIT FOR LOST EMPLOYMENT OR A RAT. FALSE REPORTS OF POLICE THAT CAN RESULT IN CRIMINAL RECORDS DEPORTATIONS THE LOSS OF CHILDREN IF CVS GETS INVOLVED. THOSE ARE. THOSE ARE THINGS THAT CANNOT BE RECTIFIED. I'M I SHOULD SAY THAT IT IS CERTAINLY TRUE THAT VIOLENCE IS VERY IMPORTANT IT CAN LEAD TO DEATH IT DOES LEAD TO DEATH. IN PARTICULAR WHEN WOMEN ARE PREGNANT OR HAVE NEWBORN CHILDREN THAT INCREASES LEGALITY RIGHT IT'S A PARTICULARLY DANGEROUS TIME FOR VICTIMS. I'M ON THE ONE HAND JUST BECAUSE THERE IS SOME VIOLENCE IN A RELATIONSHIP IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE RELATIONSHIP. HAS TO MATCH THE PILOTS YOU REALLY HAVE TO LOOK AT. THIS PATTERN OF POWER AND CONTROL AND USUALLY IF THIS IS A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RELATIONSHIP THERE'S GOING TO BE SOCIAL ISOLATION THERE'S GOING TO BE PSYCHOLOGICAL ABUSE THERE'S GOING TO BE FINANCIAL ABUSE. THERE'S GOING TO BE MANY DIFFERENT THINGS NOT JUST PHYSICAL VIOLENCE AT THE SAME TIME NOT ALL ABUSERS USE PHYSICAL VIOLENCE. OFTEN EITHER THE THREAT OF VIOLENCE- OR THE USE OF THE OTHER TACTICS I JUST MENTIONED. IS ENTIRELY SUFFICIENT TO KEEP. HIM INTIMIDATED AND CONTROLLED AND PHYSICAL VIOLENCE. THE BEES OR SOMETHING DOESN'T NEED TO RESORT TO- FINALLY BATTERS TEND TO. WELL I'M OFTEN A BATTERY MIGHT BE WELL EDUCATED SMART PUT TOGETHER IMPOLITE VICTIMS MAY PRESENT VERY POORLY. YOU'RE VERY EMOTIONAL MAY NOT BE CAPABLE OF INTERACTING WELL WITH AUTHORITY FIGURES MAY HAVE TRAUMA RESPONSES AND COULD EVEN HAVE ABOUT SUBSTANCE ABUSE PROBLEMS IN RESPONSE TO TRYING TO DEAL WITH THE ABUSE. OF THE QUESTIONS WHY DON'T MAKE THEM SWEET- THE SHORT ANSWER IS A LOT OF TO LEAVE. HART AND PARTLY THIS GOES TO THE CYCLE OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE THERE IS A CYCLE. OFTEN THERE'S INTERPRETER IT WAS THEN AND HE'S EARNED IT DOWN THERE'S A BUILD UP OF STRESS. THERE'S A TRIGGER OR RELEASE. STRESS RESULTING IN AN INCIDENT WETHERBY VIOLENCE OR NOT. AND THEN WE'LL BE A HONEYMOON. AND THESE CYCLES CAN OCCUR WITH ANY FREQUENCY ONE TODAY ONCE YOU'RE ONCE A MONTH. VICTIMS ALSO OFTEN STAY BECAUSE OF THAT HONEYMOON PERIOD BECAUSE THEY WANT THE MUSIC TO CHANGE BECAUSE HE IS THE FATHER OF THEIR CHILDREN. BUT AT THE SAME TIME OFTEN STAY BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO OTHER CHOICE. AT THIS POINT THEY MIGHT HAVE NO FAMILY NO FRIENDS NO MONEY NO CAR NO HOUSE IN YOUR JOB. THERE'S NO WAY FOR THEM TO LEAVE. AND THEN FINALLY. MAY STAY BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE. IT IS TRULY SAY FOR THEM TO. IF THEY STAY HERE KILL HER YOU WILL KILL HER IN THE TWO- SORRY SHE LEAVES HE WILL KILL CHILDREN CHILDREN IF SHE STAYS SHE MIGHT BE ABLE TO AT LEAST DIRECT HIS VIOLENCE TOWARDS HER. RATHER THAN THE CHILDREN OR MAKE ME BE ABLE TO PLACATE OR MODERATE VIOLENCE IN OTHER WAYS. AS A FINAL NOTE SEPARATING FROM AN END USER IS THE MOST INTERESTING PROJECT. THAT IS WHEN EVERYONE GOES ON EVEN MOST DOWNS TRYING TO LEAVE MULTIPLE TIMES BEFORE THEIR ALTERNATELY SUCCESSFUL. IN LEADING END USER. THE DOMINANT TO THE SECOND PART OF MY PRESENTATION WHICH IS WHAT IS THE FAMILY ABOUT HOW THE PROJECT. IT'S KNOWN AS AFTERSHOCKS YOUR SHORT AND IT'S A NONPROFIT LEGAL ORGANIZATION BASED IN OAKLAND. THAT SERVES ALL OF CALIFORNIA AND RECENTLY EXPANDED TO WASHINGTON STATE. ITS PRIMARY FOCUS IS ON FAMILY LAW WITH A SECONDARY FOCUS ON DEPENDENCY BUT IT'S A GOAL IS TO END TO THE INTERGENERATIONAL SILENT CYCLE OF MY- SPECIFICALLY LEGAL SYSTEM. BOTH OF THE TRIAL COURT LEVEL THAT MEANS FAMILY COURT AND DEPENDENCY COURT IN AT THE APPELLATE LEVEL WHICH MEANS ASKING THE COURT OF APPEAL IN CALIFORNIA TO STEP IN AND EITHER AFFIRM OR REVERSE TRIAL COURT DECISIONS IN ORDER TO HELP FURTHER PROTECT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIMS. IT'S A PRETTY NEW ORGANIZATION WAS FOUNDED IN TWENTY TWELVE BY TWO UC BERKELEY LAW STUDENTS. AND THE WHOLE IDEA BEHIND IT IS THAT CALIFORNIA THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE IS ONE OF THE MOST PROGRESSIVE LEGISLATURES IN THE WORLD WE HAVE SOME REALLY GOOD LAWS ON THE BOOKS TO PROTECT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIMS. BUT THEY ARE NOT BEING ENFORCED IN TRIAL COURT. NOT ALL. BUT SOME OF THEM AND SO THAT WAS FOUNDED TO BE LIKE HEY THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME. ORGANIZATION HERE TO TRY AND ENCOURAGE TRIAL COURT JUDGES TO ACTUALLY APPLY THESE LAWS AND TO APPLY THEM IN THE RIGHT WAY LATER THEY JUST SET YOUR INTENDED TO PROTECT. AND SOMETIMES THAT MEANS APPEALING THOSE DECISIONS. AND GETTING THE COURT OF APPEAL TO TELL TRIAL JUDGES HATE YOU GOT SOMETHING WRONG. OR SOMETIMES IN CASES THIS HEY YOU GOT SOMETHING RIGHT ESPECIALLY WHEN AN ABUSER APPEALS. A TRIAL COURT DECISION THAT WENT AGAINST HIM. IN TERMS OF DEPENDENCY THAT WILL STEP IN WILL FILE AMICUS BRIEFS AMICUS. IN CERTAIN- DEPENDENCY APPEALS AND WE WILL ALSO REQUEST PUBLIC CASES THAT WE BELIEVE WILL REMOVE DEPENDENCY CASE LAW COURT WILL BETTER PROTECT VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. SO NOW I'M I DON'T HAVE THAT MUCH TIME BUT I'M NOT SURE AND SHE FINALLY WHAT ARE YOU KNOW WE'RE DOES AFFECT. WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF CHILD WELFARE AND DEPENDENCY SYSTEM WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE CHILDREN KEPT WITH NON OFFENDING SURVIVOR PARENTS CHILDREN SHOULD NOT BE PHYSICALLY REMOVED FROM VICTIM KAREN UNLESS IT IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY CHILDREN WHO HAVE WITNESSED OR EXPERIENCED DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IN THE HOME HAVE ALREADY UNDERGONE A LOT OF PROTECTIVE PARENTS THE ONLY PARENT THAT HAS STOOD UP FOR THEM AND HELP THEM. IS A MOTHER OR FATHER IS DOING ADDITIONAL HARM ABOVE AND BEYOND WHAT THEY WENT THROUGH BY EXPERIENCING THAT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. HOW DOES THIS COME UP. WHERE DO WE SEE THIS INTERESTING VIOLENCE CASES. WE TYPICALLY SEE THAT'S WHERE THE NON OFFENDING VICTIM PARENT IS ALLEGED TO HAVE FAILED TO PROTECT THE CHILD. DEPENDENCY COURT WILL COME IN. AND TAKE JURISDICTION OVER CHILD BASED ON CERTAIN- YOU KNOW STATUTES THE WELFARE AND INSTITUTIONS CODE. AND ONE OF THEM IS IF YOU FAILED TO PROTECT A CHILD FROM- YOU KNOW DANGEROUS BEHAVIOR FROM ANOTHER PERSON OR A STUDENT. AND- OFTEN ALTERNATELY CHILDREN ARE REMOVED FROM THE VICTIM'S PARENTS BECAUSE THE CHILD WELFARE AGENCY ALLEGES THAT THE JUDGE AGREES THAT THE VICTIM'S PARENTS. CHECK THE CHILD FROM WITNESSING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SO WHAT WHAT. THIS DOESN'T COMPORT WITH WHAT IS BEST FOR CHILDREN AND WE BELIEVE THAT THERE SHOULD NOT BE JURISDICTION OVER VICTIM'S PARENTS FOR FAILURE TO PROTECT FROM DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IN AND OF ITSELF. TELL YOUR TO PROTECT FROM ACTUAL PHYSICAL ABUSE OR SEXUAL ABUSE IS ANOTHER MATTER AND THAT'S CERTAINLY SHOULD STILL BE IN THE LAW BUT THIS FELT THE CURRENT PRACTICE OF REMOVING PARENTS FROM PROJECT PROMOTES A WHOLE HOST HAS A WHOLE HOST OF BACKGROUNDS ARTS. I'M OFTEN NUMBER ONE IT OFTEN PROMOTES AN INCORRECT UNDERSTANDING OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. THAT'S LIMITED TO PHYSICAL. SOCIAL WORKER TYPICALLY DON'T SEE ALL OF THE OTHER TACTICS THAT I MENTIONED ABOUT THEIR ONLY RESPONDING TO PHYSICAL VIOLENCE- PUNISHES THE VICTIM HER ACT. IT'S BASED ON THE INCORRECT ASSUMPTION THAT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS A MUTUAL OF ACTS THAT BOTH PARTIES ARE EQUALLY RESPONSIBLE AND THEY CONTROL THE KIND. THE VICTIM PARENT MAY. HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO PROTECT THE CHILD AND NOW SHE'S ALLEGED TO HAVE FAILED TO PROTECT THE CHILD. THE VICTIM PARENT MAY INDEED HAVE PROTECTED THE CHILD BY SAY TAKING AN ABUSER'S VIOLENCE AND DIRECTING THEM TO HER AND NOT THE CHILD. AND SHE'S TO HAVE FAILED THE CHILD. IT CURRENT FOR REPORTING ABUSE AND THIS IS REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT IF A VICTIM PARENT CALLS THE POLICE TO REPORT THE VIOLENCE THE POLICE OFTEN WILL CROSS REFER TO CBS THEN THERE'S A DANGER OF DEPENDENCIES IS INSTITUTED A SURVIVOR IS GOING TO BE SEPARATED FROM HER CHILDREN AND SHE MAY BE SEPARATED EVEN AT THE SAME TIME WHEN THE PROSECUTION'S REQUIRING HER TO TESTIFY. I'M USERS NO THAT'S OKAY AND THEY WILL TELL VICTIM DON'T POLICE YOU CALL THE POLICE THE SECOND REPUBLICAN BC YES WE OUT HERE AND YOUR KIDS WILL BE TAKEN AWAY. AND SO THIS IS A REAL BIG CONSIDERATION- IT WHAT. WE MEANS HAVING THIS FAILURE TO PROTECT CASE LAW IN HERE STATUTE IT DISSUADES VICTIMS FROM COMING FORWARD REPORTING YES- AND THEN WHEN THE VICTIM DOESN'T REPORT THE ABUSE ONE OF THEM DOESN'T CALL THE POLICE ON SOMEONE ELSE'S STATUS. THE VICTIM IS STILL SEPARATED FROM THEIR CHILDREN BECAUSE EMPLOYEES DO GET CALLED IN AND SHE'S TOLD SHE SHOULD HAVE CALLED THE POLICE. IT'S A CATCH TWENTY TWO AND THERE'S NO WAY FOR A SURVIVOR TO ACT THAT DOES. NOT PUT THEM AT RISK. ULTIMATELY I THINK. THIS IS A POINT OFF LOSSES TO PROTECT PUBLISHES THE CHILDREN FOR THE ACTS OF THE ABUSE- YOU KNOW GIVE A CHILD IS. AND I ALREADY SAID THIS BEFORE BUT I'M GONNA SAY IT AGAIN. IT'S PUNISHING THE CHILDREN THE CHILD IS REMOVED FROM THE ONLY PROTECTED CURRENTLY KNOWN AND PLACED IN A FOSTER. IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM. IT THAT'S NOT RIGHT IT'S NOT THE BEST INTEREST OF THE CHILD IT IS FUNDAMENTALLY DAMAGING. AND THEN FINALLY- YOUR PROTECTORS DICTION WHEN DEPENDENCY COURTS COME IN THEY'RE REALLY ONLY SUPPOSED TO REMOVE A CHILD OR EVEN ASSUME JURISDICTION OVER CHILD IF THERE IS A CURRENT RISK OF HARM TO THE CHILD. HELLO OFTEN WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT THERE MAY HAVE BEEN DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND FAMILY BUT THE VICTIM BY THE TIME IT GETS TO DEPENDENCY COURT HAS SLAPPED. A SEPARATE IT MAYBE SHE'S GOT A RESTRAINING ORDER MAYBE SHE'S IN A SHELTER MAYBE SHE HASN'T SEEN THE ABUSER FOR FOUR MONTHS- XCERRA. AND YET THE DEPENDENCY COURT STILL ASSUMES JURISDICTION OVER THAT CHILD STILL SAYS THERE IS A CURRENT RISK OF HEART WHEN THE VICTIMS LIKE. I SEPARATED I DID EVERYTHING YOU ASKED ME TO DO I AM NOW IN A SHELTER I HAVE A RESTRAINING ORDER OPERATING WITH THE PROSECUTION AND YOU ARE STILL TELLING ME. THAT I FAILED TO PROTECT MY CHILD. IT IS NOT EXACT. YEAH CONVINCE VICTIMS TO TRUST YOU KNOW GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES OR OR- OR AGENCIES AND A FUTURE SO. IF WE ARE GOING TO MAINTAIN. THIS FAILURE TO. PROTECT LANGUAGE AS IT IS CURRENTLY. NOW IN THE LAW THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE OF AN EMPHASIS ON CURRENT RISK THE CHILD JUST BECAUSE THERE IS PAST HARM. DOES NOT MEAN THAT THERE WILL BE FUTURE CAR- AND ALSO I HAVE SEEN AT BOTH JUDGES AND CHILD WELFARE AGENCIES. ONCE IS A WELL DOCUMENTED FACT AND YOUR RELATIONSHIPS TO ARGUE THAT- WELL THE VICTIMS ONLY BEEN SEPARATED TWO MONTHS. SHE'S GONNA GO BACK TO HIM SO THEREFORE WE HAVE TO STEP IN AND WE HAVE TO ASSUME JURISDICTION OR REMOVE THE CHILD. BUT BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW IF THAT SITE IS BROKEN. IT'S NOT THE RIGHT WAY OF THINKING ABOUT IT- THERE ARE PLENTY OF OTHER WAYS A CHILD WELFARE AGENCY CANTOR INFORMALLY SUPERVISOR FAMILY. I AM AT TAKING JURISDICTION OR REMOVING A CHILD FROM A PARENT SHOULD BE THE LAST SHOULD BE DRASTIC. MEASURES THAT ARE ONLY TAKEN UNDER EXTREME CIRCUMSTANCES- I HAVE PLENTY OF HER COMMENTS BUT MY TIME IS UP. B. TO TAKE QUESTIONS- I WILL NOTE THAT I WILL HAVE TO SIGN OFF AT ELEVEN AM AND DID YOU AT NEXT PANELISTS WILL BE DISCUSSING IN MUCH MORE DETAIL ADDITIONAL PROBLEMS WITH THE DEPENDENCY SYSTEM. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU SO MUCH ON YOUR FOR YOUR TESTIMONY- YOU TOUCHED ON A LOT OF ISSUES THAT ARE. REALLY SIGNIFICANT- FIRST OF POWER AND CONTROL THAT YOU DISCUSSED- I'D LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT EVERY SINGLE TIME WHEN I DO TALK TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE JUST TO HIGHLIGHT. EVERYTHING THAT YOU ADDRESS IN TERMS OF POWER AND CONTROL AND HOW WE HAVE THIS MISCONCEPTION OF WHAT IS DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND A LOT OF TIMES IT'S- ODD THE POWER CONTROL THAT HAPPENS BEFORE THE PHYSICAL ASSAULT BY WAY OF EXAMPLE EITHER. CHOOSING WHO AT THE FRIENDS ARE ISOLATING PEOPLE FROM THEIR FROM THEIR FAMILY AND FRIENDS AND SO I ALWAYS LIKE TO TELL PARENTS WHO THEY'RE LISTENING WE USED TO ASK TEENAGERS HAVE YOU BEEN ASSAULTED. HOW'S YOUR BOYFRIEND OR SIGNIFICANT OTHER ASSAULTED YOU BUT I THINK WE NEED TO CHANGE THE WAY WE ADDRESS THAT AND ALSO ASK IS YOUR- BOYFRIEND OR GIRLFRIEND COURSING YOU ARE THEY CHOOSING YOUR FRIENDS FOR YOU ARE THEY TAKING YOUR PHONES AWAY FROM YOU SO I'D LIKE TO JUST. PUT THAT OUT THERE BECAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE. THE COERCION HAPPENS WAY BEFORE THE PHYSICAL ASSAULT THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING THAT YOU SHARED AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT. WE HAVE TO CHANGE OUR MINDSET WHAT IS DOMESTIC VIOLENCE I ALSO APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT YOU BROUGHT FAILURE TO PROTECT WHICH IS AN ISSUE THAT I'VE BEEN TRYING TO. TO DELVE INTO AND RESOLVE I THINK THAT WE SHOULDN'T BE. OB TRAUMATIZING A VICTIM TWICE IN THE FIRST BY THE ASSAULT SECOND BY REMOVING A CHILD THAT SHOULD BE WITH THE NON ABUSIVE PARENT AND SO WE DEFINITELY TO LOOK INTOIT. I WANT TO TURN IT OVER TO- SENATOR SKINNER ANY COMMENTS QUESTIONS. THANK YOU- I'M GONNA DECIDE WHEN QUESTION I OBVIOUSLY I'M REALLY INTERESTED IN THIS THE. THE POINT YOU MADE ON THE ABOUT THE FAILURE TO PROTECT AND HOW THAT HURTS THE CHILDREN PUNISHES THE CHILDREN AND THE VICTIM SO DEFINITELY WE'LL TALK MORE WITH THAT MY CHAIR ABOUT HOW WE MIGHT PURSUE TRYING TO FIX THAT BUT- THE OTHER LINE I WANTED TO JUST ASK NOW IT'S NOT THE FOCUS OF THE HEARING PER SE BUT T'S- IT BEARS ON ALL OF THIS. IS OUR OUR LAWS NOW ADEQUATE FOR DEALING WITH THIS COERCIVE ASPECT IS CONTROLLING ASPECT OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. ON SENATOR RUBIO FOR EXAMPLE HAD A BILL. THAT I WORKED WITH HER- AND I THINK IT WAS MEAN COLLECTOR BUT- WHERE WE RECOGNIZED THAT. THERE WAS A LACK OF ACKNOWLEDGEMENT WITHIN OUR STATE PENAL CODE AND WITH OBVIOUSLY WITHIN THE- LAW ENFORCEMENT FOR. THE TYPE OF CONTROL OVER THE TYPE OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE THAT ISN'T THAT DOESN'T LEAVE PHYSICAL SCARS BUT IS THAT CONTROLLING DEBT IS VERY EXTRAORDINARILY DAMAGING. AND SO  WONDERED IF YOU FELT THAT WE HAVE ADEQUATELY- FIXED OUR PENAL CODE TO RECOGNIZE THAT PART. OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. I THANK YOU SENATOR CENTERED SKINNER FOR THAT QUESTION I AM GOING TO HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU BECAUSE THAT IS. AN EXCELLENT QUESTION AND- I NEED TO LOOK INTO IT FURTHER I DIDN'T PROVIDE I DIDN'T REVIEW THAT RIGHT BEFORE THE HEARING THE STORIES. I WILL BOTH THE JOURNAL INTEREST IN THAT FOR THE FUTURE AND I THINK THAT WHAT WE- ARE YOU KNOW I MEAN LOOK YOU CAN'T IT'S- IT ABUSERS. WHATEVER THE- THERE'S LOTS OF TOOLS THEY CAN USE BUT I THINK WHAT WITH. THINGS LIKE SOCIAL MEDIA NOW THE ABILITY TO MORE EASILY. FIVE SURVEIL YOUR- YOUR VICTIM THE PERSON YOU ARE TRYING TO CONTROL. THAT THERE'S- THERE CAN BE THIS THAT MANY MORE FORMS OF THAT CONTROLLING COERCIVE BEHAVIOUR. SO I THINK AND YET IT IS. EASILY IF NOT EVEN MORE DAMAGING THAN PHYSICAL VIOLENCE ABUSE AS YOU TOUCHED ON IS RISING- ESPECIALLY AS THE YOUNGER GENERATION USE TECHNOLOGY MORE AND MORE. AND IT IS SOMETHING THAT OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THE COURTS ARE GENERALLY ILL EQUIPPED TO DEAL WITH- WHETHER THAT'S BECAUSE IT REQUIRES COMPUTER FORENSICS TO TRACE SAY IT DAMAGING POST BACK TO AN END USER'S COMPUTER- OR- SIMPLY SOME TECHNOLOGICAL KNOW HOW. IT'S OFTEN BEYOND MOST JUDGES ABUSERS AND STARED SORRY MOST JUDGES AND POLICE OFFICERS TO SIMPLY SIMPLY LACK THE RESOURCES TO INVESTIGATE AND SO I THINK THE FIRST THING THAT CAME TO MY MIND WHEN I HEARD YOUR QUESTION IS. IT'S ALMOST- THE LAWS WE HAVE ON THE BOOK RIGHT NOW. CERTAINLY CAN BE IMPROVED BUT IT'S ON THE GROUND ENFORCEMENT HOW ARE THEY GONNA GET ENFORCED WHO IS GOING TO ENFORCE THAT- AND I THINK THAT OFTEN JUDGES AND POLICE OFFICERS AND YU JUST NEED TO GET JUST LOOK THE OTHER WAY THEY CAN'T DEAL WITH THAT THEY CAN DEAL WITH A BLACK EYE. THEY CANNOT DEAL WITH THE VICTIM SAYING HE POSTED IT- YOU KNOW NAKED PHOTOS HE TOOK WITHOUT MY CONSENT TO GRINDER WHICH HAPPENS ALL THE TIME. AND IT'S- THE- AN END. COME HOME. OXFORD PEOPLE ON THE GROUND. AM I THINK THAT TODAY THE PEOPLE ON THE GROUND AND I'M TALKING TO POLICE OFFICERS AND SOCIAL WORKERS. THEY KNOW THAT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS BAD AND THAT IS THAT'S GREAT BECAUSE FORTY YEARS AGO WE WERE NOT THERE. BUT THEY DON'T NECESSARILY KNOW THAT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS NOT JUST PHYSICAL VIOLENCE SAYS THERE'S AN EDUCATION AND TRAINING COMPONENT. AND THEN THERE'S A RESOURCE COMPONENT- SAY THERE IS TERRIBLE TECHNOLOGICAL ABUSE WHO WHO'S GOING TO PROSECUTE. BATTERY WAS GONNA LOOK INTO THAT REMARKS DOES THAT MY TAKE. THIS IS BECAUSE A LINE OF INQUIRY THAT WE CAN PURSUE WE DO NOT HAVE TO SPEND MORE TIME TODAY BECAUSE OUR HEARING IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT BUT I THINK THAT- WE- IN THE COURSE OF THE BILL THAT. THE SENATOR KERRY SENATOR RUBIO CHAIR. WE DISCOVERED WE MET WOMEN WHO EVEN AFTER SO THEY WERE IN THIS CASE IT WAS ONE WHO WAS SUBJECTED TO PHYSICAL VIOLENCE. BUT WHO THEN WAS ABLE TO HAVE HER ABUSER PROSECUTED FOR THE PHYSICAL VIOLENCE COMPLETELY REMOVED HERSELF AND HER CHILD FROM THAT. BUT THEN THAT ABUSER LATER WAS ABLE TO. WIPE OUT THIS WOMAN'S CREDIT HISTORY. AND PLANT THINGS THROUGH HACKING AND SUCH THAT WERE DISPARAGING TOWARD HER WHICH THEN AFFECTED HER CAREER AFFECTED HER ENTIRE PLANET I MEAN LOOK BASICALLY CREATED. LONG TERM DISASTROUS RESULTS. M. WHICH WE NEVER WERE ABLE TO BE I'M NOT ABLE TO BE BUT RATHER WERE NOT EVER PROSECUTED. SO THE REPERCUSSIONS REMAIN GREATER THAN THE INITIAL CIRCUMSTANCE BUT ANYWAY IT'S A LINE OF AREA THAT WE'VE OBVIOUSLY TO PURSUE SEPARATELY. BUT ANY INFORMATION WOULD BE HELPFUL AND I THINK THE EDUCATION. PROBABLY IS THE IMPORTANT PART. THE ONE THING I WAS IN A SPOT THAT IS WHEN- YOU'RE HAPPY WHEN I FAMILY AND THAT. SISTER AND- THE VICTIM IS TRYING TO GO THROUGH YOUR REUNIFICATION TO TRY GET HER TO BACK. WHAT YOU OFTEN SEE IS THAT BATTERIES WILL SABOTAGE THAT PROCESS FOR INSTANCE IF SHE NEEDS TO ESTABLISH INDEPENDENT HOUSING AND A JOB TO GET HER KIDS BACK OR AT LEAST TO BE STABLE ENOUGH TO DO ALL THE OTHER REQUIREMENTS THAT THE COURTS REQUIRING HER. IF HER CREDIT IS RUINED AND SHE GETS HER FIRED FROM THE JOB THAT CAN REALLY SABOTAGED VICTIMS- ATTEMPTS TO GET THE CHILD BACK SO IT ACTUALLY DOES COME UP INDEPENDENCY. IN MORE OFTEN THAN YOU WOULD THINK. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT I JUST WANT TO ADD TO ITS REAL QUICKLYSO THE BILL THAT I PASS WITH THE HELP OF FASTENERS SKINNER WAS S. B. ELEVEN FORTY ONE WHICH DEFINES COURSE OF CONTROL- AND I DO KNOW BASED ON. ALL THE MESSAGES I RECEIVED FROM VICTIMS- CONSISTENTLY IT'S STILL A CHALLENGE TO HAVE COURTS RECOGNIZES UNDERSTAND IT AND SO THE EDUCATION PIECE IS IMPORTANT AND THE ENFORCEMENT PIECE IS ALSO IMPORTANT- I WANT TO WELCOME OUR COLLEAGUE AND SENATOR ANNIKA YOU KNOW WHO HAS JUST JOINED US. WELCOME THANK YOU- FOR YOUR TESTIMONY BUT NOW I WILL TURN IT OVER TO- SENATOR COVER YOU FOR ANY COMMENTS FOR OPENING REMARKS. WELL I JUST WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR VERY MUCH FOR- SCHEDULING THIS SELECT COMMITTEE HEARING- REALLY IMPORTANT TOPIC AND- IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE INFORMAL DATA INDICATES THAT- DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. IT HAS BEEN ON THE RISE DURING THE- CURRENT VIRUS. PANDEMIC AND- AND SO WE NEED TO BE PREPARED- TO BE ABLE TO OFFER ASSISTANCE TO. THOSE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE. INTERESTED IN LEAVING AN ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP SO THAT THEY HAVE THE RESOURCES AND SO THAT OUR COMMUNITY HAS THE RESOURCES TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND TO THINK VERY MUCH OF THE CHAIR FOR. THIS OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS AREA. THANK YOU- NEXT HOUR WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT PANELIST JULIE MCCORMICK WITH THE CHILDREN LOST CENTER. SHE'S A SENIOR POLICY ATTORNEY AT CHILDREN'S LAW CENTER OF CALIFORNIA. SHE IS ALSO A PRACTICING FAMILY LAW FOR HAS BEEN PRACTICING FAMILY LAW FOR OVER A DECADE BOTH IN THE PRIVATE AND NONPROFIT SECTOR. JULIE HAS ALSO WORKED ON POLICY AND LEGISLATION IMPACTING COMMERCIALLY SEXUALLY EXPLOITED CHILDREN IN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US YOU HAVE THE FLOOR. THANK YOU CHERRY BO AND HONORABLE MEMBERS FOR SHEDDING LIGHT ON THIS CRITICAL ISSUE AND FOR PROVIDING THIS OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO SPEAK TO YOU- FIRST LET ME EXPLAIN CHILDREN'S LAW CENTER CALIFORNIA. THE ORGANIZATION I WORK FOR REPRESENTS APPROXIMATELY THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND CHILDREN AND YOUTH IN LOS ANGELES SACRAMENTO AND PLASTER. FOSTER CARE SYSTEMS- I WAS LIKE HE'S CARRYING A TRAY FOR THIS ORGANIZATION FOR ABOUT SEVEN YEARS SO DID DIRECT REPRESENTATION FOR HUNDREDS OF CHILDREN IN YEARS- PRIOR TO THAT I WAS. PRACTICING FAMILY LAW- AND WORKED- FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ORGANIZATIONS THAT FOCUSED ON TEENS AND DATING VIOLENCE- THE EDUCATION AND LEGAL REPRESENTATION OF THOSE YEARS- AND SO WE WANT TO TALK TO J. I APPRECIATE ON YA FOR LAYING SOME GROUNDWORK AND TALKING A BIT ABOUT DEPENDENCY. AND THE GENERAL OVERVIEW OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE MY- TELLS ME TODAY IS GOING TO BE FOCUSED ON- I GET A GENERAL OVERVIEW OF DEPENDENCY COURT SYSTEM. THE IMPACT OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ON CHILDREN AND THE THINGS THAT WE SEE WHEN THESE CHILDREN USE COME INTO. OUR CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM I THEN WANTED- LOOK AT THE CHILD WELFARE INTERVENTIONS IMPACT ON CHILDREN AND FAMILIES AND SORT OF THE THINGS THAT- WE SEE AS PROBLEMS AND- WHAT WE BELIEVE ARE WHAT ARE SOME OF THE POSSIBLE. SOLUTIONS GOING FORWARD SO VERY BRIEFLY- DEPENDENCY COURT THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM- YOU'LL HEAR WE HAVE A PARENT'S COUNCIL COMING ON AFTER ME THEY WILL GET MORE INTO THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK A LITTLE MORE INTO THE WELFARE INSTITUTIONS CODE. BUT THE- READ THE DEPENDENCY SYSTEM HE SAYS COME INTO OUR SYSTEM ONE OR FOR ALL THE VIEWS OR NEGLECT- COMES IN AND THAT CALL CAN COME FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT A MEDICAL PROVIDER A TEACHER. DOMESTIC VIOLENCE COUNSELOR A SHELTER- AS YOU MENTIONED IT CAN COME FROM DEBUTS ARE THEMSELVES- BOARD CAN COME- THE VICTIM- AND I THINK WHAT WE SEE IS- WHEN SOMEONE IS SEEKING OUT HOW. THAT IS SOMEHOW THAT'S WHY THEY FOUND BUYING THEM SO AND- IN A STORE. SO THEY'VE GONE TO ACCOUNTS OR THEY'VE GONE TO A SHELTER SEEKING HELP AND THEN A REFERRAL IS MADE. TO THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM THOSE REFERRALS ARE THEN INVESTIGATED AND IF THEY ARE SUBSTANTIATED CASES FILED WITH ARTWORK WITH THE DEPENDENCY COURT- AND UNDER CALIFORNIA STATE LAW. THE STATE WILL THEN GET AN ATTORNEY THE PARENT HAS AN ATTORNEY AND THE CHILD HAS A RIGHT TO AN ATTORNEY AND THAT'S WHAT THE CHILDREN'S LAW CENTER DOES WE REPRESENT. THE CHILD ENSURING THAT THEIR VOICE IS HEARD ALSO INSURING THAT THEIR MENTAL HEALTH EDUCATIONAL NEEDS ARE BEING MET DURING THE TIME THEY FALL UNDER OUR SYSTEM- ONE OF THE ISSUES WE HAVE SEEN AS REALLY IS A LACK OF GOOD SOLID DATA. AS IT RELATES TO THE INTERSECTION OF CHILD ABUSE AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. ON YOU BRIEFLY MENTIONED THAT THERE'S THIS WEEK HOW THE WELFARE INSTITUTIONS CODE THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY- AND THAT IS OUR NEGLECT STATUTE. NOW WHEN HE'S COMES IN UNDER THAT STATUTE IT'S VERY BROAD IT CAN FALL UNDER GENERAL NEGLECT IT CAN BE A MENTAL HEALTH ISSUE- THAT THE PARENT IS EXPERIENCING IT COULD BE SUBSTANCE ABUSE. AND FROM OUR EXPERIENCE A LARGE NUMBER OF THOSE CASES DO COME AND DUE TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. AND WHEN THEY COME IN WHAT THE LAUNCH OF THE PAGE IS THAT THE SYSTEM IS GOING TO PROVIDE REGIONAL. SERVICES TO THE PARENTS. RIGHT TO PREVENT REMOVE. HOWEVER BECAUSE OF A LACK OF RESOURCE.OR JUST. BETWEEN THE CHURCH WELFARE IN THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE COMMUNITY WE SEE THAT MANY OF THESE CASES LEAD TO THE CHILDREN BEING REMOVED- SO WHAT WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS. WHAT WE CAN HEAR A LOT TODAY IS WHAT THE SYSTEM IS DOING WRONG- AND THAT IT IS PUNITIVE TO PARENTS WHICH WE DO NOT DISAGREE WITH. OUR WE LIKE TO FIRST ESTABLISH THAT THERE CAN BE AN ONGOING REST. TO A CHILD IN A HOME WITH DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. SO WE'VE SEEN THERE ARE STUDIES THE IMPACT OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ON CHILDREN. THERE'S POTENTIAL RISKS THE PHYSICAL REST. STUDY SHOWING HOMES WHERE VIOLENCE BETWEEN PARENTS A CURSE PARTNERS FIRST. CHART INCREASED RISK OF BEING ABUSE. THEY ALSO CAN EXPERIENCE PHYSICAL HEALTH PROBLEMS INCLUDING GENERALIZED ANXIETY. SLEEPLESSNESS NIGHTMARES DIFFICULTY CONCENTRATING. HIGH ACTIVITY LEVELS INCREASED AGGRESSION- INCREASED ANXIETY ABOUT BEING SEPARATED FROM A PARENT OR EVEN INTENSE WORRY ABOUT THEIR SAFETY OR THE SAFETY OF THE PARENT THAT IS BEING ABUSED- WE'VE ALSO SEEN THAT THERE CAN BE. LONG TERM PHYSICAL HEALTH PROBLEMS- AND THEN BEHAVIOR PROBLEMS THAT DEVELOP INTO ADOLESCENCE. AND STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT CHILDREN THAT HAVE EXPERIENCED DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IN THE HOME- CAN HAVE A HIGHER INCIDENCE OF DELINQUENCY INVOLVEMENT THEY CAN BE 75274% MORE LIKELY. TO COMMIT A VIOLENT CRIME- 50% MORE LIKELY TO ABUSE DRUGS OR ALCOHOL. TWO TIMES MORE LIKELY TO REPEAT THE CYCLE OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE- AND I THINK IT'S TIME YEAH MENTION THEIR ORGANIZATION AND THEIR GOAL IS TO STOP THE INTERGENERATIONAL CYCLE OF VIOLENCE SO. WE DO SEE A GREAT CONCERN FOR CHILDREN THAT ARE- WITNESSING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IF THEY ARE LIKELY TO REPEAT THAT CYCLE. THEY ALSO CAN EXPERIENCE EMOTIONAL DIFFICULTIES. IN ADULTHOOD WE'VE SEEN AN INCREASE IN OPPRESSION ANXIETY DISORDER AND POST STRESS DISORDER. SO CLEARLY THERE ARE UNDOUBTEDLY SITUATIONS OR INNOVATE INTERVENTION IS NEEDED GIVEN ALL THESE INCREASED RISKS. HOWEVER WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS THE SYSTEM RESPONSE CURRENTLY IS HUGELY DETRIMENTAL TO FAMILIES- THERE'S SORT OF A ONE SIZE FITS ALL AND I BELIEVE THE PANEL ITSELF TO ME BRIAN'S GOING TO ADDRESS THAT MORE. BITE- REALLY IN THE SYSTEM BY WHICH CAN BE CAUSED BY A RANGE OF ISSUES AND WHAT I MEAN- YOU KNOW FOCUSED ON THE POWER CONTROL OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE DO SEE WE ALSO SEE FAMILIES- THAT ARE EXPERIENCING POVERTY. OR HOMELESSNESS OR SUBSTANCE ABUSE OR MENTAL HEALTH AND INSTEAD OF ADDRESSING THOSE ISSUES IT'S SORT OF A ONE SIZE FITS ALL REMOVE THE CHILD FROM THE HARM. AND NOT GIVING THE FAMILY THE SUPPORT NEEDED TO EITHER ADDRESS THEIR UNDERLYING PROBLEMS WHETHER THAT BE SUPPORT WITH HOUSING OR MENTAL HEALTH OR GETTING THEM INTO IT- SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT PROGRAM OR ADDRESSING UNDERLYING TRAUMA AND RELATIONSHIP ISSUES- SO THESE INTERTWINED ISSUES OF HOMELESSNESS AND POVERTY. REALLY PAT GREAT PART AND A LOT OF THE CASES THAT WE SEE COME BEFORE- OUR COURTS- AND I THINK THAT'S ONE THING THAT WE WANTED TO FOCUS ON IS THE MANY THE MYRIAD OF REASONS. THAT A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CASE COULD COME IN AND HOW RIGHT NOW THE SUPPORTS ARE NOT BEING PROVIDED- WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN AS I MENTIONED THERE'S A REASONABLE SERVICE REQUIREMENT- THE LAW REQUIRES THAT BEFORE FAMILY IS SEPARATED. THEY SHOULD BE PROVIDED SERVICES TO ELIMINATE THE RISK- OFTENTIMES THERE ARE GREAT BARRIER SO WHEN A- VICTIM IS BEING TOLD THAT THEY'RE FAILING TO PROTECT BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOT REMOVED HIMSELF FROM THE SITUATION. BUT AS WE KNOW HOUSING CAN BE A HUGE BARRIER I'M TELLING- EVERYONE IN CHILE AS WELL AS- BABY ALL THAT'S AVAILABLE IS A SHELTER THEY CAN ONLY KEEP OUR HER CHILDREN THERE FOR A FEW WEEKS. OR ARE THERE SOME FINANCIAL BARRIERS AND WHERE THE JOB IS- LANGUAGE BARRIERS WE SEE WE SEE IMMIGRATION BARRIERS. AND THE CURRENT PROCESS REALLY TAKES AWAY THE VICTIM'S POWER- THEY'RE EXTREMELY PRESCRIPTIVE PLANS THAT IT'S LIKE A GUY IN THIS ONE SIZE FITS ALL. THAT THIS IS WHAT'S HAPPENING OKAY YOU NEED TO IMMEDIATELY LEAVE THE ABUSER LEAVE EVERYTHING THAT YOU'LL NOW WITHOUT REALLY ADDRESSING WHAT THEIR NEEDS ARE AND WHAT SUPPORT CAN BE GIVEN TO THEM- ONE EXAMPLE WE OFTEN ENCOUNTER IN OUR- PRACTICE HERE BECAUSE WE DO REPRESENT- YOUTH WERE ALSO PARENTS THEMSELVES SO. SOME OF OUR OLDER TEENAGE CLIENTS. ARE THEMSELVES PARENTING AND THEY DO FIND THEMSELVES IN RELATIONSHIPS OR VIOLENCE IS AN ISSUE BUT INSTEAD OF TEACHING THEM ABOUT HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS OR DRESSING THEIR OWN TRAUMA. AGAIN WE GO TO THAT ONE SIZE FITS ALL SOLUTION WHICH IS TO REMOVE THEIR CHILDREN. BUT THAT'S NOT A DRESSING FOR THE SUPPORTS THEY NEED THE DEVELOPMENT OF HEALTHY RESPECTFUL NONVIOLENT RELATIONSHIPS. TEACHING TEENAGERS HOW TO MAINTAIN A HEALTHY RELATIONSHIP AND DEVELOPING SKILLS ABOUT MANAGING THEIR FEELINGS ARE COMMUNICATING IN A HEALTHY WAY. YOU KNOW FOCUSING ON PREVENTION MEASURES- LIKE HAVING SUPPORT SYSTEM FROM THEIR PEERS AND THEIR FAMILIES- AND REALLY AGAIN JUST NOT LOOKING. TOO WHAT THEY ARE- VICTIM NEEDS WHAT A FAMILY MEANS- AND AGAIN LOOKING. AT SO WHERE ARE THE- AREAS WE CAN. AND WE DO FEEL THAT ONE OF THE REASONS ONE A DRY- THIS ISSUE AS WELL AS WE CAN BE AS A LACK OF TRAINING AND KNOWLEDGE ON DOMESTIC VIOLENCE- FOR THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM- RECOGNIZING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE- AGAIN OUR FIRST PRESENTER ON YEAH YOU KNOW TALKED ABOUT THE DIFFERENT. TYPES AND THAT MANY PEOPLE IMMEDIATELY GO TO PHYSICAL VIOLENCE- NOT UNDERSTAND THAT THERE CAN BE FINANCIAL OR EMOTIONAL OR- AS THE BELL CENTRE REVIEW PART FOR THE COURSE OF CONTROL ISSUES. SO WE'RE FAILING TO EVEN RECOGNIZE THE TYPES OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE THE DIFFERENT FORMS OF IT HOW CAN WE BE SURE THAT WE'RE PROVIDING THE- CORRECT RESOURCES THAT WE EVEN ARE AWARE OF WHAT RESOURCES EXIST- AND THEN HOW TO MAKE AN INDIVIDUALIZED ASSESSMENT. OF WHAT FAMILIES NEED TO MOVE FORWARD- AND THIS TRAINING AND KNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTANDING NEEDS TO BE BY THE ENTIRE SYSTEM WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ATTORNEYS- SOCIAL WORKERS AND OUR JUDICIAL OFFICERS- ONE AREA WHERE. THE CHILDREN'S LAW CENTER IS BEGINNING TO FOCUS IS TURNING BRAIN INJURY- WE'RE LEARNING- THAT MANY VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE HAVE ENCOURAGED MATIC BRAIN INJURIES. WHICH CAN HAVE A PHYSIOLOGICAL FACTS FOR SOME PERIOD AFTER THAT INJURY- AND INSTEAD OF RECOGNIZING SIGNS OF THIS TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY- AS I MEAN I HAD MENTIONED IT IMPACTS HOW WE LOOK AT A VICTIM. WE LOOK AT THE WAY THAT THE PRESIDING AND THAT THEY ARE UNINVOLVED IN DON'T CARE ABOUT THE CHILD IF THERE'S AN APATHY OR AN UNWILLINGNESS TO ENGAGE IN SERVICES WHEN THERE MAY BE THE UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION- AND THE PHYSICAL IMPACT OF A TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY AND HOW IT MIGHT MANIFEST. AS A FAILURE TO COMPLY OR WHAT WE'VE HEARD ABOUT THE FAILURE TO PROTECT- WE'RE STARTING A PILOT ACTUALLY I'M HERE TO COLLECT DATA. WE'RE GOING TO BE SCREENING ARE OUR COMMERCIAL SEXUALLY- CHILDREN AND ARE PRAYING APPEARANCE. YOUTH FOR TRAUMATIC BRAIN GENERALSHIP INJURIES I'M SORRY SUSTAINED FROM INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE- OUR CHALLENGE IS GOING TO BE TOGETHER RESOURCES AND PROVIDERS TO FURTHER SUPPORT EDUCATION AND ADVOCACY FOR CLIENTS AND COURTS. AND COUNSEL- WITH THE GOAL TO BE TO. THREE INDIVIDUALIZE QUE CLASE PANTS ARE MORE ALIGNED WITH BRAIN TRAUMA- IN HOPES OF IMPROVING OUTCOMES- THIS GOES BACK TO THE FURTHER INSTEAD OF LIKE PROVIDING TRUE PREVENTION INTERVENTION SERVICES. OFTEN THE RESPONSE WE SEE AS TRUMP THE CHILDREN AND PLACE THEM INTO FOSTER CARE SO WHILE I DISCUSSED PREVIOUSLY THAT HARM THAT CAN COME TO THE CHILDREN BY BEING AT HOME WITH THE MYSTIC VIOLENCE I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE HARM TO THE FAMILY AND TO THE CHILD. FROM CHILD WELFARE INTERVENTION YOU KNOW IN THIS IS THAT SYSTEM THAT'S COMING INTO CONTACT- SO. WE'LL HEAR MORE FROM OTHER ADVOCATES. BUT THE HARM TO THE FAMILY. IS THE VICTIM BEING PUNISHED AND I BELIEVE I CAN COVER THAT A LOT BY WHEN THEY'RE REACHING OUT FOR HELP AND THEN THEY FIND THEMSELVES IN THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM BEING PUNISHED FOR SEEKING HELP. ARMED SERVICES CAN BE EXTREMELY OVERWHELMING AND THEY ARE NOT PAID FOR SO WE SET UP THESE PROGRAMS FOR FAMILIES TO PARTICIPATE AND WHETHER THAT BE. A BATTERER'S INTERVENTION PROGRAM OR PARENTING OR- COUNSELING- GETTING TO THOSE SERVICES CAN BE DIFFICULT AND THERE ARE YOU KNOW A FINANCIAL BURDEN TO THESE FAMILIES WHO ARE EXPERIENCING. THE LOSS OF THAT HAD TO ME ABOUT THE LOSS OF SOME FINANCIAL SUPPORT- THE FAMILY CAN SOMETIMES LOSE BENEFITS WHEN THEIR CHILDREN ARE REMOVED. AND I GUESS I SAID TRYING TO KEEP UP WITH ALL THE COURT MANDATED PROGRAMS- AND THEN ANOTHER ONE WITH TAT WE SEE AND I DON'T BELIEVE IT'S BEEN TOUCHED UPON. BUT WE OFTENTIMES PENALIZE FAMILIES IF THERE'S ANY EXPRESSED INTENT TO REMAIN TOGETHER AS A FAMILY- AND THERE ARE SITUATIONS WHERE IF SERVICES AND SUPPORTS ARE PUT IN PLACE THIS MAY BE WHAT IS BEST FOR THAT FAMILY AND ASKING THAT% FAMILY WHAT THEY NEED. SO THE ASSUMPTION IS VICTIM SHOULD IMMEDIATELY LEAVE THE ABUSER OR THERE IS A FAILURE TO BE TAXED WHERE THEN THERE MIGHT BE AN INDIVIDUAL LYSED WAY. TO BETTER SUPPORT THE FAMILY. AND SHE'S. THEN THE HARM TO CHILL. WHEN THE INTERVENTION OF THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM COMES IN AND WHERE WE JUST COME IN AND REMOVE THE CHILD- THAT'S THE TRAUMA FROM SEPARATION- YOU KNOW IT'S- WE NEED TO ADDRESS THE HARM. TO CHILDREN IN A HOME WITH DOMESTIC VIOLENCE BUT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO ALSO ADDRESS THE HOME TO BEING REMOVED AND PLACED IN FOSTER CARE AND THIS SHOULDN'T BE A DEBATE ABOUT WHAT IS WORSE WE DON'T WANT TO DO A BALANCE OF HARMS AND THAT WAY. WE SHOULD BE WORKING OUT HOW WE CAN FIX THAT- CELL LOOKING AT WHAT HAPPENS TO THESE FAMILIES AND HOW CAN WE BETTER SUPPORT THEM- BY PROVIDING PROTECTION TO THE CHILD AND TO- THE VICTIM. BUT ALSO ENSURING THAT THE SUPPORTS THAT ARE NEEDED ARE PROVIDED TO THEM- I BELIEVE I'M GETTING THE SIGNAL THAT I'M RUNNING OUT OF TIME SO I JUST WANNA THANK YOU ALL- FOR YOUR TIMEAND ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE AND I REALLY LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT TAX MONEY HOW TO LEAD I WILL NOW TURN IT OVER TO OUR MEMBERS FOR ANY. QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS WILL START WITH- SENATOR W. I DON'T. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR- THEN AND I WANT TO THANK THE PANELISTS FOR THEIR TESTIMONY ERE TODAY IT'S IMPORTANT- TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT HOW WE CAN. ENSURE THAT THE SYSTEM WORKS BETTER. NOT ONLY FOR- THE- VICTIMS FOR LACK OF BETTER WORDS THAT ARE FLEEING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE BUT ALSO THEIR CHILDREN WE KNOW THAT- THE TRAUMA. I MEAN IT'S PROBABLY ALMOST IS DIFFICULT FOR CHILDREN TO EXPERIENCE THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS THE- VICTIM THEMSELVES AND- AND MANY OF THEM CARRY IT WITH THEM. THEIR ENTIRE LIFE AND I'M I'M WONDERING IF. IF THE SYSTEM THAT HAS BEEN SET UP I'M NOT I'M NOT EVEN SURE THAT IF EVERY SINGLE COUNTY HAS A CASA. A PROGRAM THAT PROVIDES ASSISTANCE TO- EIGHT AND HERE- IF YOU WELL THAT'S NOT INVOLVED IN THE- OUTCOME OF ANY PROCEEDING- TO THE CHILDREN WHETHER THAT'S A- A VALUABLE SOURCE OR RESOURCE- AND- AND WHAT THE- WHAT THE- WHAT ARE THE SOLUTIONS TO. TRYING TO PROVIDE SOME ASSISTANCE TO THE CHILDREN AND TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE HEARD IN A COURT ROOM SETTING AS WELL. BETTER HAVE YOUR THAT WAS DIRECTED TOWARDS ME. I BELIEVE SO YES OKAY- N. AS- OF FAR AS CAUSES AN LA COUNTY- AND SACRAMENTO COUNTY THE COUNTY IS WE PRACTICED AND WE DO HAVE COSTS AS AND WE DO UTILIZE THEM- AND TO MAKE IT CLEAR AS ATTORNEYS FOR THE CHILDREN WE ARE THE VOICE OF THE CHILDREN. SO WE'D YOU- INTERVIEW THE CHILDREN WE DO INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATIONS AND WE BRING THAT- THAT VOICE TO THE COURT ARMAMENT. OBVIOUSLY DEPENDING ON THE CHILD'S AGE THAT BERRIES- WE DO HAVE TO- BUT GETTING TOO TECHNICAL MINORS COUNCIL IN CALIFORNIA HOLD A DUAL ROLE WHERE WE LOOK AT THE CHILD'S BEST INTEREST AS WELL AS THEIR STATED INTERESTS- AND I CAN DEPEND ON. YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY ON THE AGE OF THE CHILD SO WE ARE THERE IS ALWAYS A CHILD BECAUSE AS OBVIOUSLY A GREAT RESOURCE AND CAN BE ASSIGNED- BY CASE BY CASE BASIS SO THAT YOU CAN HAVE ANOTHER. OUTLET BUT WE ARE THAT WAYS WE DO THE INDEPENDENT RELATIONS I THINK THE SOLUTIONS THAT WE'RE SORT OF LOOKING AT AND WARS I TRANSPIRED FIRST PANELIST- IS IN THE FAILURE TO PROTECT AROUND- AND JUST MORE SO JUST NOT HAVING THIS ONE SIZE FITS ALL. THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT THE FAMILY AND WHAT THEY NEED AND THAT WHEN SOMEONE REACHES OUT FOR HELP THAT THERE IS NOT A PUNITIVE THE FACT THAT WE ARE. REALLY COMING TOGETHER TO SUPPORT- AND I THINK JUST THE WAY THAT THE CURRENT O'CLOCK STATUTE AS WRITTEN AND SORT OF HOW IT'S IMPLEMENTED MARCEL- THOSE SUPPORTS. ARE ALWAYS PUT IN PLACE. AND- I WAS AT THE FOREFRONT WE ANT TO PROTECT CHILDREN FROM HARM- WE WANT TO PROTECT FAMILIES- BUT SOMETIMES WHEN YOU GO TO YOUR IMMEDIATE REACTION IS JUST REMOVE AND SEPARATE- WITHOUT TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE ADDITIONAL TRAUMA THAT IS BEING PUT ON THAT CHILD. FROM THAT SEPARATION. GOT IT I GUESS MY CONCERN IS- THAT NOT EVERY FAMILY ENTERS THE COURT SYSTEM IN THE SAME WAY. AND- I HAVEN'T PRACTICED LAW. FOR A FEW YEARS NOW- BUT WHEN I DID WHEN I HAD MY LOT MY OWN LAW PRACTICE SITE I TOOK THREE HUNDRED AND SIX HUNDRED CASES COURT APPOINTED AND REPRESENTED PARENTS AND- CHILDREN DEPENDING ON. THE LANGUAGE ABILITY OF THE PARENTS- MANY TIMES I WAS APPOINTED TO BECAUSE I SPOKE SPANISH BUT- BUT MY REAL CONCERN IS THAT- IS IT WHEN YOU. WHEN YOUR COURT APPOINTED IT'S USUALLY BECAUSE A CHILD IS ALREADY GOING TO BE REMOVED FROM THE HOME AND THE ONES THAT WE DID THAT I DIDN'T GET COURT APPOINTED ON WERE THE ONES THAT WENT THROUGH THE DAY THE- DVORCE OR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SYSTEM THAT THEY DIDN'T END UP AS PART OF A THREE HUNDRED OR SIX HUNDRED CASES AND SO- AND KNOWS CHECK CHILDREN- MANY TIMES WERE NOT REPRESENTED IN COURT- IT WAS THE PARENTS FIGHTING FIGHTING IT OUT OR THE- OR- OR- THE VICTIM- IF THERE WAS NEVER A DIVORCE PROCEEDING OR CUSTODY PROCEEDING THAT KID'S- WISHES WERE NEVER. REALLY TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT AND I GUESS I'M JUST THE SYSTEM IS A COMPLICATED SYSTEM DEPENDING ON HOW YOU INTERPRET AND I'M- AND THE MORE FLEXIBILITY WE GIVE TO JUDGES THE MORE DIFFERENCE IN TREATMENT YOU SEE- AND SO WE'RE WE'RE IN A- I GUESS WORK I THINK OUR INTEREST IS MAKING SURE THAT- WE'RE PROTECTING THE INTERESTS OF THE CHILD AND THE VICTIMS. AND THAT THERE'S A SYSTEM IN PLACE TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THEM NEED AND I DIDN'T ALWAYS SEE THAT IN THE COURT I GUESS THAT'S MY BIGGEST CONCERN- YES. YEAH AND I'VE I CAN BRIEFLY ADDRESSED THAT I WORKED IN THE I WAS A FAMILY LAW ATTORNEY- AND THAT WAS KNOW HAVE A VOICE EXCEPT IN VERY LIMITED SITUATIONS WHERE. MINORS COUNCIL WAS APPOINTED- BUT THAT WAS A RARE- AND IT IS ONE OF THE REASONS I AM. AN ORGANIZATION WHERE EVERY CHILD HAS A VOICE- BUT I THINK ONE THING AND I DON'T KNOW THAT WE TOUCHED ON IT- BUT IS. IN THE BEGINNING IS SORT OF THE PREVENTION SERVICES. IS WORKING WITH SYSTEMS THAT COME INTO CONTACT WITH THESE FAMILIES- TO PREVENT THIS SORT OF THE FILINGS OF THESE CASES IN CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM WORKS TO HELP FAMILIES EVEN IN THE FAMILY LAW SYSTEM. SO IT'S PUTTING IN THOSE PREVENTION SERVICES AND SUPPORTS- THAT YOU KNOW. WHAT I GUESS RIGHT AWAY THAT YOU KNOW WE'D LIKE TO SEE THE ISSUES ADDRESSED BEFORE THEY HAVE TO EVEN COME UNDER OUR SYSTEM I REALIZE IN THE FAMILY SYSTEM THAT'S A LITTLE DIFFERENT BITES- I THINK IT COMES TO YOU KNOW BETTER TRAINING- AND FOR SOCIAL WORKERS AND FOR THOSE THAT ARE COMING INTO CONTACT WITH THESE FAMILIES- I THINK WE'VE HEARD TODAY JUST A VARIETY OF WAYS THAT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE- CAN MANIFEST AND MANY PEOPLE AREN'T AWARE OF THAT- SO BEING ABLE TO ADDRESS THIS IN A PREVENTATIVE MANNER EARLY ON. I APPRECIATE THAT THAT'S THAT'S REALLY I GUESS WHAT I WAS GETTING TO IS THE SUPPORT SERVICES SO THAT. WE DON'T END UP IN THIS IN THE SYSTEM. OURSELVES FAMILIES DON'T END UP IN THE SYSTEM IF THEY CAN AVOID IT THEY CAN MAKE THE DECISIONS FOR THEMSELVES ABOUT HAVING TO GO TO COURT AND- FIGHT IT OUT IN FRONT OF A JUDGE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU I WILL NOW TURN IT OVER TO SENATOR SKINNER. ALL PASSWORD QUESTIONS THIS TIME. THANK YOU I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY- THAT WAS- BILLION LIGHTNING AND I THINK YOU TOUCHED ON SOMETHING THAT JUST CAUGHT MY ATTENTION WHICH IS THE INTERGENERATIONAL VIOLENCE ON AND WHAT HAPPENS TO THOSE VICTIMS OF THE CHILDREN IMPACTED BY DOMESTIC VIOLENCE- AND I KNOW THAT YOU KNOW BEING A TEACHER FOR SEVENTEEN YEARS- USUALLY I CAN SPOT SOMEONE. A CHILD THAT'S BEEN EXPERIENCING SOME TRAUMA IN THE HOME BECAUSE YOU START SEEING SOME OF THE CHANGES IN ACADEMIC. UPGRADES AND CHANGES IN BEHAVIOR AND SO ONE OF MY BIGGEST CONCERNS AND CHALLENGES WHAT YOU STATED- WHEN YOU REMOVE A CHILD FROM A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE HOME. THEY DON'T HAVE NECESSARILY A GOOD MODEL OF WHAT A HEALTHY RELATIONSHIP IS THEY DON'T HAVE. ANY OTHER EXAMPLE SO IT'S I GUESS IT'S SOMETHING THAT I THINK WE NEED TO EXPLORE A LITTLE FURTHER HAD DO WE GET THOSE SERVICES TO THOSE. CHILDREN IMPACTED BY DOMESTIC VIOLENCE HOW DO WE GET THE MOM TO TWENTY STAND WHAT A HEALTHY RELATIONSHIP IS AND SO IT'S SOMETHING THAT- I WOULD JUST KEEP IN THE BACK OF MY MIND AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN FIGURE OUT HOW TO CHANGE THAT BEHAVIOR SO IT DOESN'T CONTINUE GENERATIONALLY STILL. THANK YOU FOR THAT SO NOW WE WILL MOVE OVER TO OUR NEXT PRESENTER- NEXT IS BRAIN OKAMOTO MR OKAMOTO. IS A PUBLIC DEFENDER IN ORANGE COUNTY AND HAS BEEN FOR EIGHTEEN YEARS AND BRIAN ALSO SERVES AS A MEMBER OF THE JUVENILE COURT PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT. COMMITTEE THE FLOOR IS YOURS WELCOME. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT SENATOR AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HOSTING THIS. THIS FORM SO THAT WE CAN. SHARE OUR EXPERIENCES AND I APPRECIATE YOUR OPEN MINDEDNESS TO IT ALL I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE PREVIOUS PRESENTERS- INFORMATION IS ABSOLUTELY ENLIGHTENING THERE IS SOME OVERLAP WITH. FINE AND I'LL TRY NOT TO OVERLAP TOO MUCH BUT I THINK WHAT WE'LL DO IS WE'LL UNDERSCORE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE POINTS THAT. YOU COULD HELP ME ALL THREE HAVE DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES WE'RE ALL SAYING THE SAME THANKS AND I THINK THAT'S TELLING. SO I MY NAME IS BRIAN OKAMOTO I AM A PUBLIC DEFENDER IN ORANGE COUNTY I DID CRIMINAL LAW FOR FIFTEEN YEARS AND NOW INDEPENDENT STATES IN AFRICA. OR WHEREVER SENT PARENTS. THE LAWS OBVIOUSLY DIFFERENT HERE THAN IT CRAMPED THE POPULATION WE SERVICE THE SAME. A SEMESTER HERE ARE. PARENTS WHO STRUGGLE WITH ABJECT POVERTY. SUBSTANCE USE ISSUES- DOMESTIC VIOLENCE MENTAL HEALTH. AND SOME AND OFTEN THESE THESE SYMPTOMS THAT WE SEE. ARE EXACERBATED BY THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM THAT REMOVES CHOKE. SO WHAT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT TODAY- ARE BASICALLY TWO THINGS ONE- I DON'T WANNA GO OVER TOO MUCH IN THE LAW I THINK THAT'S BEEN COVERED BUT I DID WANT TO TOUCH UPON THAT. BUT ALSO TO DESCRIBE THAT FROM MY POINT OF VIEW OF HOW THE SYSTEM ACTUALLY WORKS. AND I HOPE THAT AS I TALK ABOUT THESE TOPICS THAT THE FEW POINTS REALLY CUT TO LIGHT. ONE IS THAT THE STATUTES AND STANDARDS OF REVIEW THAT GOVERN OUR DECISIONS ON DOMESTIC VIOLENCE HERE IN DEPENDENCY. ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO BIAS SEES AND MISGUIDED PRECONCEPTIONS OKAY DO ALLOW FOR PUNITIVE AND SOMETIMES OVERSIMPLIFIED REACTIONS THAT CAN PUNISH NOT JUST DEFENDING PARENTS. BUT THE ABUSE THE PARENTS AS WELL AND EVEN THE CHILD AND I THINK THE PREVIOUS PANELISTS ADDRESSED THAT. TOO THAT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS COMPLEX AND NUANCED AND JOE WE TALKED ABOUT THIS ALREADY AND THAT WE SHOULDN'T BE APPROACHING- ADDRESSING THESE FAMILIES AND DEPENDENCY COURTS WITH A ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH THAT'S NOT JUST ASK THE DETERMINATIONS THAT WE MAKE COURT SUCH AS WHETHER OR NOT WE START JURISDICTION. OR MOVE CHOKE AND RETURN SHELLS BUT IT ALSO HAS TO DO WITH HOW WE PROVIDE SERVICES TO THESE FAMILIES WE SHOULD NOT HAVE A ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH TO THAT AS WELL. AS THIRD THAT THERE HAVE BEEN RECENT APPELLATE OPINIONS TO TWENTY TWENTY AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE ON DOMESTIC VIOLENCE INDEPENDENT STATE. AND WHILE THOSE OPINIONS ARE EXTREMELY ENCOURAGING BECAUSE OF BRINGING TO LIGHT. A LOT OF THE CAR THAT THE IT. THE RESEARCH UNDER BUYING AND GIVING SOME MORE ACCURATE ON THAT. THEY'RE ALSO CONCERNING BECAUSE HE'S OUR RECENT OPINIONS AND THOSE DECISIONS ARE BASED ON. IT HE- ARGUMENTS AND DECISIONS MADE IN OUR TRIAL COURTS AND WHAT THEY DO IS THEY REVEAL. THAT OUR SYSTEM HERE SOMETIMES WILL OPERATE ON A MISGUIDED CULTURE. A MISUNDERSTANDING OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND THAT THERE IS A NEED FOR EDUCATION REFORM. AND SO I APPRECIATE THIS OPPORTUNITY I'M A LET ME JUST JUMP IN. SO JULIE MENTIONED THAT I WOULD BE TOUCHING ON SECTION. B. AND I KNOW THAT ON YOUR ALREADY ADDRESSED AS WELL SO THIS IS JURISDICTION WHEN THE COURT TAKES JURISDICTION OVER CASE THE COURT HEARING DEPENDENCY TEXTERS DICTION OVER THE CHILD NOT THE PARENTS. THE PURPOSE OF DEPENDENCY IS NOT TO PUNISH PARENTS TO PROTECT CHILDREN AND TO REUNIFY FAMILIES THOSE ARE MANDATES. SO THREE HUNDRED B. IS THE CODE SECTION THAT WE REFER TO AS THE FAILURE TO EXTRACT YOUR- BASICALLY THREE ELEMENTS THE COURTS LOOKING FOR ONE WAS THERE JUST THE PARENT. IS THE PARENT UNABLE TO PROVIDE NECESSARY SUPERVISION OR PROTECTION OF THE CHILD. AND CAUSATION YES THAT'S TRUE. THREE SERIOUS PHYSICAL HARM. OR ILLNESS OR SUBSTANTIAL RISK OF EITHER. SO WHAT DOES THIS MEAN WHEN WE TALK ABOUT WHEN WE THINK ABOUT BURTON. RIGHT SO IS THIS A HIGH BURDEN IT'S ARGUABLY IT WOULD BE GREAT BECAUSE WE'RE WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT ANY KIND OF RISK WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A SUBSTANTIAL RISK RIGHT NOW WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT ANY KIND OF PHYSICAL MEMORY ON THIS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. SERIOUS PHYSICAL HARM ADULTS WHAT EXACTLY DO THESE TERMS MEAN SUBSTANTIAL OR SERIOUS AND WHERE IS THAT LINE. FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WHEN IT IS A RISK VERSUS A SERIOUS RISK WHERE THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL YES OR- OR JUST A REGULAR RISK WHO MAKES THOSE DETERMINATIONS BECAUSE THE CODE DOESN'T PROVIDE US A CLEAR DEFINITION. WHERE THAT LINE IT'S- SO THE ANSWER TO THAT. AND WHO PROVIDES THIS LINE THE JUDGES IT'S THE SOCIAL WORKERS ALL OF US ARE THE ONES THAT ARE TRYING TO APPLY THE STANDARD. AND THE MOST UNIFORM WAY POSSIBLE. BUT WE'RE HUMANS AND WE ALL BRING FORCED OUR UNDERSTANDINGS OR INTERPRETATIONS CIRCUMSTANCE FACTS AND YES MR VIOLENCE. AND THAT SHOULD BE CONCERNING SOMETIMES. BUT THE ROLE OF THE SOCIAL WORKER IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL AS WELL BECAUSE THE SOCIAL WORKERS MAKING RECOMMENDATIONS TO WORK TO THE COURT WHETHER OR NOT WE SHOULD ASSERT JURISDICTION WHETHER OR NOT WE SHOULD REMOVE CHILDREN'S PARENTS THE SOCIAL WORKERS ARE GIVING THESE RECOMMENDATIONS AND ARE GIVEN GREAT WEIGHT BY THE JUDGE RIGHT. BECAUSE SOCIAL WORKERS ARE DEEMED AS IMPARTIAL ARMS OF THE COURT. IN FACT HEARSAY IS ADMISSIBLE IN THE SOCIAL WORK REPORTS BECAUSE OF THEIR RECOGNIZED PROFESSIONALISM- THAT THEY'RE RELIABLE AND THAT THEIR UNBIASED. SO IT IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL EVERYONE IN OUR SYSTEM AND ESPECIALLY THE SOCIAL WORKERS INVOLVED ARE UP TO DATE AND AWARE. OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND THEIR ACT THEY HAVE AN ACCURATE UNDERSTANDING OF THAT BECAUSE THE RECOMMENDATIONS CARRY GREAT WEIGHT IN OUR COURTS. SO IF WE DON'T IF WE S. PROTECT ACTIVE SHOOTERS JUDGES AND SOCIAL WORKERS DON'T FULLY REALIZE THE REALITIES OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. BUT OFTEN TIMES WE'LL DO IS WE'LL RELY TRANSIENTS AND PRECONCEPTIONS AND THAT MAKES US GROUND. AROUND HIS DECISION FAMILIES ON IMPORTANT ISSUES. LIKE WHETHER OR NOT WE SHOULD REUNIFY FAMILIES WITH SEPARATED CHILD FROM THE PARENTS. RIGHT AND SLIPS FURTHER TRAUMA IN CHILDREN AND WORST CASE SCENARIO EVEN TERMINATION OF PARENTAL RIGHTS. SO IN PRACTICE WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE WE'VE HEARD BOTH PANELISTS TALKED ABOUT FAILURE TO PROTECT. THE AREA WHERE WE CAN SOMETIMES ACTUALLY REMOVE A CHILD FROM AN ABUSIVE PARENT AND I'VE HAD SITUATIONS WHERE I'VE HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH MY CLIENTS BUT THAT IS BEING DISCUSSED. AND WE'RE ON THE BRINK OF THE COURT REMOVING THE CHILD FROM THAT PARENTS CARE. THAT PARENT LOOKS AT ME CONFUSED WONDERING WHY. HAVING JUST BEEN ABUSE. THE COURT WOULD TAKE AWAY MY CHILD. WHY WOULD THE COURT. TO THAT TRAUMA WITH ADDITIONAL TRAUMA BY REMOVING THAT CHILD IT'S ABSOLUTELY TRAGIC FOR THE CHILD'S SPOT ACTUALLY AND IT'S TRAGIC FOR THAT PARENT AS WELL- THE PARENT DOESN'T UNDERSTAND HOW THE SYSTEM WOULD WANT TO. PLACE THAT CHILD. IN A STRANGER'S HOME. FOR A COTTAGE WITH OTHER STRANGERS IN THE CHILD NOT KNOWING WHEN HERE SHE'S GOING TO GO BACK TO THE PARENTS AND ESPECIALLY AT THIS IMPORTANT INSTANCE FRIGHTENING TIME AFTER A MASSIVE PROBLEMS OCCURRED. THESE ARE REAL CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE IN OUR SYSTEM AND I KNOW THERE'S BEEN SOME DEBATE ON THIS TOPIC AND HOW WE SHOULD PROBABLY WEAR THIS BUT I THINK AS A STARTING POINT WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE. THAT WE TO PAUSE. BEFORE WE DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS WE SHOULD HAVE WE SHOULD HAVE GUIDELINES IN PLACE TO PREVENT THIS OR MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT- I KNOW IT'S BEEN DISCUSSED. BUT I THINK IF WE ALL FOCUS ON THE TRAUMA THAT BOTH CHILDREN AND PARENTS SUFFER FROM THIS REMOVAL UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WE CAN COME TO A CONSENSUS. IN SOME WAY AND SO I. ACTUALLY APPLAUD. SENATE ROUTE SENATOR RUBIO AND EVERYONE'S EFFORTS TO GET SOMETHING PASSED ON THIS END I GRATEFUL FOR THE VOICES BEFORE ME THAT SPOKE ON THIS AS WELL. SO IT'S BEEN TALKED ABOUT BY. JULIE ABOUT- ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH DEPENDENCY WHEN IT COMES TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. THAT IS FRONT AND CENTER ONE OF MY STUDENTS BECAUSE THE EASIER CASES ACTION OKAY RIGHT EASIER. BUT THE OBVIOUS CASES ARE THOSE WHERE WE SEE CLEARLY WHO THE ABUSER ISN'T WRITTEN IT IS S. BUT SOMETIMES IT'S NOT SO CRYSTAL CLEAR. AND WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE BEST THAT VIOLENCE. SHOULD BE EXHIBITED IN DIFFERENT WEIGHTS THERE ARE PATTERNS AND CYCLES OF VIOLENCE BUT THEY'RE ALSO DIFFERENT DEGREES OF THAT. AND THERE ARE TIMES ABSOLUTELY INTERVENE AND REMOVE CHILDREN BUT THERE ARE ALSO TIMES AND WE SHOULDN'T EVEN EXERCISE JURISDICTION IN THE CASE. AND IT'S THOSE NUANCES THAT I THINK SOMETIMES GET LOST WE APPROACH DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH WE HAVEN'T READ OVER REACTS AND STATS WE SHOULD WE SHOULD HAVE TO. WHAT WE END UP TRAUMATISING CHILDREN IN THE PROCESS. SO- WHAT WHAT DOES THAT LIKE WHAT. I WILL TO TALK ABOUT THESE OPINION BECAUSE THAT WAY IT'S NOT JUST ME SPOUTING OUT SOME OF THE THINGS I'VE EXPERIENCED IN MY KIDS. YOU CAN LOOK AT THE COURT OPINIONS AND SEE WHAT OCCURRED. IN RACHAEL L. THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE CASE IT JUST CAME DOWN RECENTLY. AND IN THIS CASE THE COURT OF APPEALS FOUND THAT THE JUVENILE COURT AARON EACH FINDING JURISDICTION. AND TEAR THE JUVENILE COURT FOUND THAT THERE WAS JURISDICTION UNDER THREE HUNDRED FEET. BECAUSE OF THE PARENTS LONG HISTORY. OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ISSUES AND THE MOTHER'S REFUSAL TO PARTICIPATE IN SERVICES THE SERVICES WORK ORDER MULTIPLE ACTS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE OVER EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME. IN FACT THERE WAS ONE INCIDENT IT WAS AN INCIDENT INVOLVING QUESTION SHOVING AND GRABBING OVER A CELL PHONE THAT OCCURRED NINE MONTHS PRIOR TO THE HEARING. SO NINE MONTHS THE MOTHER LIVE WITH A CHILD WITH NO PROBLEMS THERE WAS NO ACCIDENTS THE PILOTS THE FATHER'S WHEREABOUTS WERE UNKNOWN AND MOM. VINGTAINE A RESTRAINING ORDER. THE COURT APPEALS DISMISSED THIS PETITION. AND SO WHAT IT SAYS LOOK WE CAN APPLY THE CORPORATE FROM BRITAIN'S DECISION BUT WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE ALSO THAT THE TRIAL. COURT MADE A DECISION. FOR JURISDICTION. WITHOUT SUPPORTING EVIDENCE. AND THAT IS JUST ONE CASE THERE ARE OTHERS. SO IT BEGS THE QUESTION. WHAT EXACTLY IS DOMESTIC VIOLENCE THEN THAT WOULD SUPPORT YOUR SECTION WHAT IS EXACTLY DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. WE SOMETIMES ANSWER THIS BY OUR WITH OUR EXPECTATIONS AND OUR PRECONCEPTIONS. WITH THIS ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH EFFECTIVE VICTIM MUST LOOK LOOK A CERTAIN WAY OR BEHAVE A CERTAIN WAY IT'S A BIG IF THE VICTIM MOTHER IS NOT DOING SERVICES THAT MEAN SHE DOESN'T CARE RIGHT. IF SHE'S NOT SOFT SPOKEN OR SEEMINGLY FRIGHTENS THAT WE ASSUME THAT SHE MIGHT BE JUST MORE AGGRESSIVE OR MORE DIFFICULT THERE IS NOT A ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH THIS AND I THINK IT DOWN ON YOUR BED MENTION THIS THAT SOMETIMES THAT BATTERS YOU REALLY SOPHISTICATED AND MAKE IT THEIR OWN AND WIN OVER SOCIAL WORKERS AND JUDGES IT COULD BE CHARISMATIC RELATE TO AUTHORITY FIGURES. AND THEY CAN THEY CAN. GET IT VANISHED IN THESE COURTS OVER- SO. WE'RE OVERLOOKING AS THE TRUE VICTIM. SO THERE ARE SOME OF THIS OF HOW WE HAVE THESE EXPECTATIONS ROLES RIGHT I'D E IS A TWENTY TWENTY SIX THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF THE WALL OF A SO CALLED VICTIM ISN'T REALLY CLEAR THE CASE CAME IN BECAUSE THE MOTHER LASHED OUT AT HER USER I. THROWING SOMETHING ADAM BUT LATER IT WAS REVEALED THAT THE FATHER HAD JEALOUS RAGES ISOLATOR IS ECHOED USE THAT ANGER HER VERBAL ABUSE TO HARM HERSELF STEAM AND INDEPENDENCE AND TAUNTED HER KNOWING ME KNOWING THAT IT WOULD TRIGGER A PHYSICAL REACTION. SO NOT ALWAYS. AND I THINK WE SHOULD AVOID MAKING BREAST RUSS SNAP JUDGMENTS ON THIS- AND WHAT WE EXPECTED THEM TO ACT LIKE SO- ANY CASE IN REMEDY WHICH IS ALSO TWENTY TWENTY CASE MY JURISDICTION. IN THAT CASE THE JUVENILE COURT FOCUSED ON MOTHER'S PAST AS A VICTIM OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND NOTED THAT SHE WAS UNCOOPERATIVE THE SUBSTANCE SIX DESPITE BEING TEN MONTHS FREE THE FATHER. THE COURT STILL- TOOK ISSUE WITH MOM- HE RECORDED APPEALS RECOGNIZED STATED THIS ACTUALLY. THERE WAS A RECENT TROUBLING TREND OF WHAT THEY PERCEIVE AS MOTHERS BEING VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. AND THAT MAY BE ADDED THIS QUOTE WE EXPECT SUCH VICTIMS TO BE SWEET TRYING TO WEAR BLACK LESS FRIGHTENED AND HELP US AND NOT. A MULTIFACETED WOMAN WHO MAY OR MAY NOT EXPERIENCE FEAR ANGER. THESE ARE THE PRECONCEPTIONS THAT JUDGES AND JURORS BRING WITH THEM INTO THE COURTROOM AND DISTRUST OF RATIONALLY OCCURRED STORY WE ENCOURAGE CONTINUED DILIGENCE AND EDUCATION TO GUARD AGAINST SUCH PRECONCEPTIONS. WHAT ELSE DO WE IMPOSE OUR EXPECTATIONS WE HAVE THIS EXPECTATION THAT IN ORDER TO REUNIFY THE FAMILY OR CLOSE THE CASE OR ALLOW THE CHILDREN TO REMAIN WITH THE NOT SO CALLED NOT AFFECTING. THE PARENT HAS TO DEMONSTRATE A SEPARATION FROM THE ABUSER BUT THAT'S ALSO A NEBULOUS CONCEPT BECAUSE- HOW LONG DOES THE PARENT HAVE TO BE SEPARATED FROM THE ABUSER. IN A CASE THEN IN THAT CASE AND MAY I BE THAT TWENTY TWENTY CASE IN THAT CASE THAT THE JUVENILE COURT FOUND THAT EIGHT MONTHS OF SEPARATION JUST WASN'T. AGAIN RELIED ON THE HISTORY OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND THE ARGUMENTS AND THERE WERE QUITE SHOCKING- MINUS COUNSELING AND THE COUNTY COUNCIL'S SOCIAL SERVICES ARGUED THAT THERE WAS QUOTE NO TRUE CHANGE OF CIRCUMSTANCES BECAUSE APART. AND HER PAST FAILURES TO SEPARATE YOURSELF FROM THE FATHER WERE CONCLUSIVE PROOF THAT THE INSPIRATION SHOULD PUT PROCESSED AND ONE EVEN ARGUED THAT THE BROTHERS QUOTE COMPULSIVE INVOLVEMENT. BUT THE FATHER- HAD NOT CEASED. THIS RECORD REPEAL TOOK ISSUE WITH IT SAID THAT THERE'S A SHOCKING LACK OF UNDERSTANDING ABOUT SURVIVORS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. SUCH AS COMPULSIVE INVOLVEMENT PERPETUATE THE MYTH OF THE HELP WAS WITH BATTERED WOMEN. THIS IS AGAIN AN EXAMPLE OF US IMPOSING OUR EXPECTATIONS. ON HOW- SURVIVORS NEED TO ACT BEFORE WE EITHER RETURN THEIR CHILDREN. THOSE CASES OR SEARCH OUR RESTRICTION ON AND WE CAN BE MISGUIDED ON THIS- WHEN WE BRING THOSE STANDARDS AND WE ON'T APPLY- STANDARDS THAT WE SHOULD BE APPLYING. BUT AGAIN BECAUSE THOSE TERMS LIKE SUBSTANTIAL RISK SERIOUS PHYSICAL HARM QUITE NEBULOUS IT DOES LEAVE ROOM FOR SOME OF THESE INTERPRETATIONS- FORTUNATELY THE COURTS OF APPEAL HAVE BANNED UP VIGILANT. AND HAVE ASSISTED ON THIS SO WHAT STANDARD SHOULD GOVERN. AGAIN SUBSTANTIAL RISK YOUR SPECIAL CRIME THESE ARE NEBULOUS TERMS AND SOMETIMES WE HAVE TO DEPENDENCIES SPECIAL RECESSING FOR SCHOOL A SUBSTANTIAL RISK IS. SOMEWHAT LIKE. PREDICTING ALMOST LIKE GAZING INTO A CRYSTAL BALL AND TRYING TO GUESS WHETHER OR NOT THERE IS GOING TO BE AT RISK RIGHT. OUR SYSTEM COURT ALSO TWENTY TWENTY JETS FAMILY WAS AT THE EIGHTEEN MONTH REVIEW MEETING AT THAT REGIS IS A STATUS STATUTORY STATUS RENEWED EXPECTATIONS SHORT. UNLESS THERE IS EVIDENCE OF A SUBSTANTIAL RISK OF DETRIMENT. HERE AGAIN THERE'S THAT WORD SUBSTANTIAL RIGHT- HERE THE SOCIAL WORKER APPLYING TO THE PARENTS HAD IT RESOLVED THEIR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ISSUES AND IN THE COURT ADOPTED THE RECOMMENDATION AND TERMINATE SERVICES AND BY THE WAY WHEN SERVICES ARE TERMINATED THE CASE IS NOW ON THE DOORSTEP. TO TERMINATION OF PARENTAL RIGHTS AND IN MANY INSTANCES. THING HERE THOUGH AS BOTH PARENTS FULLY PARTICIPATED IN THE SERVICE THAT'S- MOTHER HAD A SUBSTANCE ABUSE ISSUE. THE CASE THAT THE COURT ACKNOWLEDGED WAS NO LONGER A CONCERN. BUT THE SOCIAL WORKER TESTIFIED HER CONCERN WAS THAT THE PARENTS CONTINUE TO INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER EVEN THOUGH THE SOCIAL WORKER ENCOURAGED PARENTS TO INTERACT AND CO. BUT THE COURT WAS STILL CONCERNED WITH PUBLIC RELATIONSHIP WITH THE MYSTIC VIOLENCE POINT AFTER THAT. THERAPIST FOR THE MOTHER OF MINE THAT THERE WERE NO CONCERNS THIS RELATIONSHIP AND THERE WERE NO CONTRADICTING THERE WAS NO CONTRADICTING UPDATES. THE COURT STILL FOUND BOYFRIEND POST RISK THE PURPOSE OF IT EVEN AFTER KNOWLEDGE IN THAT BUT IT DIDN'T HAVE ANY THERE WERE NO CONCERNS ABOUT MONTHS RT. AS THE DATA IN THE CASE THE COURT FOUND THAT HE HAD IN FACT INSECT. DIDN'T SAY WHAT EVIDENCE SUPPORTED THAT FINDING A LACK OF INSIGHT. ALSO SO THAT THE PARENTS SEEM TO LINGER IN THE RELATIONSHIP BUT THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE THEY MAINTAIN A RELATIONSHIP. THE COURT OF APPEALS. REVERSED THAT'S WELL. IT COULD BE SO AS A BRICK. FOR HAD TO WAIT FIVE MONTHS FOR THAT DECISION TAP. THEY WOULD NOW HAVE TO RECOVER AND REBUILD SOME OF THOSE RELATIONSHIPS. SO- HOW DO WE DETERMINE WHO AT AN ARAB WE HAVE ABOUT TWO MORE MINUTES AHA YOU MAY BE AT ME WRAPPED UP THANK YOU FOR THAT OKAY SO ONE CONCERN THAT WE HAVE- FORMULAIC RESPONSE TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE BUT WE JUST BASICALLY SAY HERE'S A DV CASE BAGHDAD MOVED OUT BOMB GET KICKED BACK IT GOT PARTICIPATE IN YOUR PERSONAL POWER PROGRAM DAD GO DO YOUR SERVICES WILL KEEP THE FAMILY SEPARATED THEN WE'LL CLOSE THE CASE WITH EXIT ORDERS BUT WHAT WE'VE DONE THERE IS WHICH SEPARATED THE FAMILY WE HAVEN'T BEGUN TO FIGHT THEM. AND THE SERVICES THAT WE PROVIDE ARE WE REALLY TRYING TO BRING THE FAMILIES BACK TOGETHER AGAIN- WE JUST GIVING STRAIGHTFORWARD SERVICES LIKE GENERAL SERVICES LIKE CLASSES INSTEAD OF INTO INDIVIDUAL THERAPY AND COUNSELING SO WHAT SHOULD WE DO I THINK WE NEED JUST CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON OUR MANDATE OF. NOT SEPARATE FAMILIES AND KEEP IT SEPARATE ACCEPT IT THERE ARE TIMES WE HAVE TO BUT THERE ARE TIMES WE SHOULD ALSO BE TRYING TO BRING UP. FAMILY BACK TOGETHER AGAIN. THANK YOU. THE CHILD DOESN'T BOTH PARENTS AND HIS OR HER LIFE. AND SOME INSTANCES. THIS THIS WEEK WE NEED TO GET TO THE ROOT CAUSES AND NOT JUST THE SYMPTOMS IN THE POVERTY. DEPRESSION AND EVEN THE PARENTS ON PAST TRAUMA. I'M NOT NAIVE TO BELIEVE THAT WE COULD SOLVE EVERY CASE BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE SHOULD DEEM EVERY CASE HOPELESS. AND OUT LASTLY. THESE CASES THESE APPELLATE CASES DO GET. BECAUSE THERE'S RECOGNITION NOW I WHATDOMESTIC VIOLENCE REALLY IS AND WE HAVE LAWS THAT WE CAN CITE. BUT STILL IT FRIGHTENS ME BECAUSE THESE DECISIONS ARE BASED ON WHAT'S OCCURRING IN OUR HEARTS. OUR COURT SYSTEM I THINK IS MAKING WITH METS WE STILL HAVE ROOM TO GROW AND I. P. RIGHT NOW WE'RE AT A PIVOTAL POINT WHERE THERE'S INTEREST. AND I BELIEVE THAT WHICH WHILE THE- IRON IS HOT. I DON'T HAVE THE ANSWERS FOR EVERYTHING I KNOW THERE'S NOT JUST ONE ANSWER AND I KNOW I HAVE TO DO MY PART TO MAKE SURE THAT THE SYSTEM WORKS. AND BE INFORMED AND I'M STILL UPBEAT TO BE TO LEARNING. THE OTHER PANELISTS AND THE SENATORS SENATORS. I'M COMFORTED IN KNOWING THAT THE OTHER PANELISTS WERE FAR MORE. INFORMED THAN I AM. ARE HERE TODAY APPLE FINDS CONCERNS AND THAT WE'RE NOT JUST EXPRESSING THESE TWO JUDGES WHO HAVE MINDS MADE UP. CONTINUE SENATORS AND MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC. EYE CARE. EARNESTLY ABOUT THI POPULATION THAT WE SERVE. I'M SO GRATEFUL. FOR YOU SENATOR RUBIO AND TO ALL OF YOU FOR CONVENING. WE APPRECIATE YOUR PARTNERSHIP IN CARING FOR THE COMMUNITIES WE SERVE THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY I WILL NOW TURN IT OVER TO MEMBERS OF THE PANEL I'M SORRY THAT COMMITTEE MEMBERS ANY QUESTIONS. I DON'T HAVE A QUESTION PER SE I MEAN THAT WAS A LOT THAT YOU CAN BAIT- WHAT I WOULD APPRECIATE HOWEVER- WE ARE WE- MANY OF US TAKING NOTES WE OBVIOUSLY OUR STAFF HERE BUT IF YOU HAD. IF YOU WERE WILLING TO SEND A SEND ME EMAIL. A FEW OF THE CONCRETE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT- BASED ON WHAT YOU'VE BEEN OBSERVING IN YOUR COMMENTS THAT WOULD BE REALLY REALLY HELPFUL PRECIADO. THANK YOU CENTER AND A COUPLE YET ONLY QUESTIONS- I JUST WANT TO THANK- I THANK THE GENTLEMAN FOR MR OKAMOTO FOR- HIS PRESENTATION I'VE I'VE TAKEN NOTES IF YOU'VE GOT THE SITES FOR THOSE CASES THAT WOULD BE GREAT- ADDED. I'M I'M I'M- I'M STRUCK BY THE COMMENT ABOUT I'M NOT HAVE A HAVING A FORMULAIC APPROACH AND SO JUST SEEMS TO ME WE MAY WANNA HAVE GUIDELINES OUR GUIDEPOST. I'M I DIDN'T REALLY PRACTICED IN PRACTICE IN THE AREA- THE CIVIL AREA OTHER THAN THESE COURT APPOINTED CASES THAT I DID MOST OF MY WORK WAS IN THE M. CRIMINAL DEFENSE AREA BUT- IT- IT JUST SEEMS TO ME LIKE THAT LIKE THE- JUDICIAL COUNCIL SHOULD HAVE GUIDELINES. THAT THEY ISSUE THAT GIVES SOME PARAMETERS AROUND SOME OF THIS IT IF THAT DOESN'T EXIST MAYBE WE NEED TO ASK- THAT. THE DATE THEY PRODUCE THAT BECAUSE THESE COURT CASES ARE APPALLING- IT THERE IT'S GREAT THAT THEY WERE OVERTURNED BUT- BUT NOT TO HAVE FACTS UPON WHICH TO- TO START BREAKING UP FAMILIES THAT HAVE BEEN PARTICIPATING IN PROCESS SEES. AND DOING THE BEST THEY CAN I GUESS THAT'S MY CONCERN BUT THE OTHER THING IS THAT I'M I'M WONDERING IF ANYBODY'S DONE ANY. ANY STUDIES AROUND- ABOUT AROUND IT IMPLICIT. BIAS IN IN THE SYSTEM- I PRACTICED IN MOSTLY RURAL AGRICULTURAL AREA AND- FRANKLY THE JUDGES HAD NO. OUR CONNECTION TO MOST OF THE POOR PEOPLE THAT CAME IN THAT WERE BEFORE THEM AND- IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WE'RE PROBABLY TAKING AWAY. CHILDREN THAT. ARE IN REALLY POOR HOUSEHOLDS MORE THAN MORE THAN NOT NUMBER ONE AND NUMBER TWO THAT MANY OF THE TIMES IT'S THE POVERTY INDICATORS THAT WOULD INDICATE THE PARENTS ARE NOT DOING A VERY GOOD JOB OR THAT WOULD LEAD A JUDGE TO ISSUE OUT REMOVAL A OPPOSED TO- SOMETHING ELSE IN IN THE HOUSEHOLD IT'S HAPPENING AND SO. I JUST- I'M- VERY VERY CONCERNED THAT WE HAVE SOME PARAMETERS IN THIS AREA AND WHETHER WE LEGISLATED. OR WE DIRECT THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL TO DO IT- WHATEVER WE NEED TO DO THAT I AGREE WITH THAT. SENATOR SKINNER WE GOT IT. IF YOU'VE GOT SOME RECOMMENDATIONS I'D BE REALLY HELPFUL. THANK YOU MR AKIMOTO I ALSO WILL AGREE WITH US MY- SENATOR MEMBERS HERE THAT IF I IF YOU CAN SEND US THAT INFORMATION. EMAIL ANY RECOMMENDATIONS YOU YOU MAY HAVE WOULD BE HAPPY TO EXPLORE IT AND I PROCEED TO APPRECIATE THE CONCRETE EXAMPLES YOU PROVIDED. FOR US TODAY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE COURT SYSTEM- FIRST I WANT TO THANK ALL THE FIRST PANELIST OUT WE JUST CONCLUDED OUR FIRST PANEL WHICH WAS FOCUSED ON THE OVERVIEW OF A CHILD WELFARE AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IN CALIFORNIA COURT SYSTEM. WE WILL NOW MOVE OVER TO PANEL NUMBER TWO WHICH WILL FOCUS ON IMPROVING OUTCOMES FOR CHILDREN VICTIMS AND FAMILIES EXPERIENCING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WE WILL START WITH. JONATHAN WIGGS WHO IS- FROM W. I'M SORRY YWCA SANK A ROGUE VALLEY. AND MR WICKS IS A TRAUMA INFORMED CARE COORDINATOR FOR THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PROGRAM AT THE- WHITE W. CA AND SAN GABRIEL VALLEY THE FLOOR IS YOURS WELCOME. HELLO THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME TODAY SENATORS IT'S REALLY COOL. TO BE ABLE TO SPEAK. ON THIS TOPIC- THANK YOU FOR ALL THE PREVIOUS PRESENTERS- IT WAS AWESOME TO HEAR FROM YOU GUYS. I'M ON THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH MENTAL HEALTH SIDE OF THINGS BUT I DO. OFTEN TIMES HELP CLIENTS WITH THE LEGAL SIDE OF THE V. SO- IT'S JUST REFRESHING TO KNOW THAT. WHITE BRIAN SAID- WE'RE ALL SEEING THE SAME THINGS EVEN FROM MY PERSPECTIVE- SO I DO HAVE A UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE ON DVD. SO I DO OUR RESIDENTIAL PROGRAM- WHICH WE HAVE TWO TRACKS IT'S EITHER FORTY FIVE DAY EMERGENCY PROGRAM BUT WE ALSO HAVE A SIX TO TWELVE MONTH TRANSITIONAL PROGRAM. SO I DO GET TO SEE AND WORK WITH FAMILIES THROUGH. A DIFFERENT TIME. DIFFERENT TIME IF- AS A KIND OF MOVES FORWARD FROM THEIR RELATIONSHIPS. WHICH WE ALSO HAVE A NON RESIDENTIAL PROGRAM OUT OF THE MAIN OFFICE. WHICH WE DO SUPPORT GROUPS AND INDIVIDUAL WORK AS WELL AND THE REALITY IS A LOT OF PEOPLE. YOU KNOW TV IS SO SUBJECTIVE DEPENDING ON THE FAMILY AND I EVERYBODY WANTS TO LEAVE THEIR PARTNER- SO WE DO GET A PRETTY GOOD VARIETY OF DIFFERENT PRESENTING CHALLENGES AND SO I'VE LEARNED A LOT. JUST FROM BEING HERE- I DID MY INTERNSHIP HERE IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN. AND THEY HIRED ME AFTER SO IT'S BEEN. A VERY INSIGHTFUL JOURNEY THANKFUL TO BE HERE TODAY. BE ABLE TO TALK ABOUT SOME THINGS SO I KNOW THE GOLFER PANEL CHU IS IMPROVING OUTCOMES- SO THERE IS A GOOD AMOUNT OF PREVENTATIVE THINGS I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT- BECAUSE AGAIN WITH TV IT'S ONE OF THOSE SOCIAL ISSUES THAT IT IS VERY MUCH PRESENT. ARE PREVENTABLE. LIKE BRIAN SAID THOUGH NOT YOU KNOW I EVEN EXPECTED TO GO AWAY COMPLETELY BUT THERE'S A LOT OF WORK THAT COULD BE DYING BEFORE FAMILIES HAVE TO COME INTO A PROGRAM LIKE OURS. OR YOU KNOW PEOPLE GROW UP WITNESSING TV THERE'S WORK THAT COULD BE DONE SO THAT THEY ALSO TURN INTO A PERPETRATOR. ALSO ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT WAS TRAUMA INFORMED CARE. AND SOME OF IT I THINK I'M SEEING IT RIGHT NOW IN OUR OWN AGENCY. IS BECAUSE- WE DO HAVE. I TURNED OVER A RIGHT NOW WE'RE GETTING TEAM MEMBERS AND AS THEY COME ON BOARD- THEY ALSO NEED TO BE TRAUMA INFORMED. BECAUSE THE TRAUMA INFORMED PERSON IS A SAFER PERSON. AND SO IT DOES ALWAYS MAKE ME WONDER YOU KNOW WHAT IS. THE STANDARD FOR TRAUMA INFORMED CARE. AND WHEN I STARTED RESEARCHING AND TO TRAUMA I WAS KIND OF SURPRISED THAT THERE'S NOT. SO MUCH OF A AGREED UPON DEFINITION OF WHAT TRAUMA IT IS AND I KNOW WE ALSO GOT INTO THAT TODAY. TALKING ABOUT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE- THERE'S NOT REALLY AN AGREED UPON DEFINITION OF WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE. FOR GOOD REASON THAT'S SUBJECTIVE BUT- AS FAR AS TRAUMA INFORMED CARE GOES YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT TRYING TO. RESIST RE TRAUMATIZING A FAMILY YOU KNOW THAT'S ALREADY LEAVING A TRAUMA. I DEFINITELY. DEFINITELY SEE THE IMPORTANCE OF TRAUMA INFORMED CARE. AND SO. YOU KNOW I'M THINKING ABOUT HOW YOU GET TRAINED AS A CLINICIAN SOMETIMES AN EDUCATOR OR A MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL. AND YOU LEARN ABOUT MANDATED REPORTING. AND IT'S NOT EVEN A QUESTION THAT YOU KNOW THOSE THINGS YOU NEED TO LISTEN FOR. WHAT YOU'RE GONNA CAUSE YOU TO HAVE TO AT LEAST CONSULT. RIGHT SO WHETHER IT'S- ARMED FOR SELF HARM TO OTHERS CHILD ABUSE ELDER ABUSE. IT'S VERY COMMON KNOWLEDGE. AND I WOULD HOPE TO SEE YOU GET TO THAT POINT WITH TRAUMA INFORMED CARE. WHERE WE ALL KNOW THE SIX. PRINCIPLES OF TRAUMA INFORMED CARE YOU KNOW- OR WHATEVER IS IT'S GOING TO BE LANGUAGE WISE I JUST FEEL LIKE THERE'S A LOT OF ROOM. FOR GROWTH AS FAR AS LIKE WHAT IS THE STANDARD. FOR TRAUMA INFORMED CARE OF BECAUSE LIKE I SAID NOT JUST OUR OWN AGENCY BUT FOR OTHER AGENCIES THAT ARE SERVING THESE FAMILIES- IF THERE IS A COMMON APPROACH TO WORKING WITH THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO TRAUMA. I THINK THAT COULD DEFINITELY IMPROVE. OUTCOMES. THE OTHER THING TO. THE FOLKS. TO IS ON CHILDREN. IS- AS GUYS OF OUR MET. YOU KNOW NOT JUST DOMESTIC VIOLENCE BUT TRAUMA IN GENERAL. IT COULD HAVE A VERY- COMMON RESPONSE AS FAR AS THE CHILD'S. SCHOOL PERFORMANCE AND FELT SOMETHING THAT I REALLY APPRECIATE HERE WITHIN OUR PROGRAM THAT WE DO. AND WE'RE CONNECTED TO SCHOOL ON WHEELS. AND I DO THINK I'VE SEEN BY INCREASED. BECAUSE OF COATED AND YOU KNOW A LOT OF STUDENTS HAD THEIR WITHDRAWAL BECAUSE OF THE VIRTUAL SET UP- BUT ON TOP OF THAT YOU KNOW WHEN THEY'RE EXPRIENCING TV IN THE HOME. THERE'S DEFINITELY THAT DROP IN SCHOOL PERFORMANCE. AND SO SCHOOL ON WHEELS IS A GREAT PROGRAM BECAUSE THEY'RE ABLE TO FOLLOW FAMILIES. IT'S A FANCY DESIGNED FOR HOMELESS. FAMILIES BUT A LOT OF IT THERE'S A HUGE OVERLAP. WITH DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND HOMELESSNESS- I KNOW THERE'S A PART WHERE. THE MAYOR'S- MERA REPORT WHERE IT WAS AROUND FORTY FOUR PERCENT. OF THEM SAID THAT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS A MAJOR CAUSE OF HOMELESSNESS. SO THERE IS A HUGE OVERLAP AND I REALLY LIKE THAT SCHOOL ON WHEELS FOCUSES ON THAT. AND I CAN LIKE I SAID THEY'RE ABLE TO FOLLOW FAMILIES AS THEY REBUILD THEIR INDEPENDENCE THEIR STABILITY. AND CELL AGAIN HELPING THE CHILDREN GET RE ENGAGED WITH SCHOOL I'VE SEEN IT DO A LOT OF GOOD- WORK FOR OUR FAMILIES HERE IN OUR PROGRAM WHERE. THE CHILDREN DID COMING WITHDRAWN AND- LIKE I SAID NOT DOING TOO WELL IN SCHOOL- BUT THEY GET CONNECTED TO SCHOOL ON WHEELS AND THEY'RE ABLE TO. GET BACK INTO THE FLOW OF THEIR ACADEMICS AND MAKE A LOT OF PROGRESS. AND SO LIKE I SAID I KNOW THE SERVICE A LOT OF DIFFERENT- COUNTIES. SAMPOERNA DINO COUNTY LOS ANGELES COUNTY INTERCOUNTY- SUCH A GREAT A GREAT I THINK STEP TO TRY TO HELP FAMILIES RECOVER. SARS PREVENTION AND THERE'S ALSO A REALLY GOOD EVIDENCE BASED PROGRAM- SO I GOT TRAINED ON IT. IT'S THROUGH FUTURES WITHOUT VIOLENCE THEY'RE OUT OF SAN FRANCISCO- WHICH WAS A GREAT TRIP TO GOING GET TRAINED. BY ESSENTIALLY THEY HAVE EVIDENCE BASED. PROGRAM CALLED COACHING BOYS INTO MEN- AS FAR AS PROVING. YOU KNOW THIS IS ONE OF THOSE. WHERE THE- IS TO. UTILIZE THE REALITY OF ATHLETES HAVE AN INFLUENCE ON THEIR CAMPUSES AND SO COACHING BOYS INTO MEN. YOU ESSENTIALLY TRAIN THE COACHES ON THIS. ANTI VIOLENCE CURRICULUM. AND ONCE A WEEK TALK TO THEIR PLAYERS THROUGHOUT THE SEASON. AND LIKE I SAID IT IS EVIDENCE BASED AND SO HAVE A LOT OF POTENTIAL AND WHEN WE'RE TALKING PREVENTION. YOU KNOW ONE OF THOSE ARE MULTIPLE OF THOSE PLAYERS ON THOSE TEAMS MIGHT BE LIVING IN A HOME. WITH T. V. BUT TO HEAR THE MESSAGE COMING FROM SOMEONE THEY LOOK UP TO LIKE THEIR COACH IT COULD TOTALLY. CHANGE THEIR DIRECTION OR THEIR TRAJECTORY. AS FAR AS BEING A PERPETRATOR THEMSELVES- SO I ACTUALLY JUST GOT TO. DO A FIRST TRYING TO INSTALL THAT TRAINING FOR THE CITY OF AS YOU SAW LAST WEEK. SO I WAS ABLE TO SIT WITH THIRTEEN STAFFERS AND EXPLAIN TO THEM WHAT COACHING BOYS INTO MEN. ENTAILS AND KIND OF COME UP WITH A PLAN ON HOW WE'RE GOING TO MOVE FORWARD AND ROLL IT OUT. WHETHER IT'S THROUGH THE CITY OF ITS USE- SCHOOL DISTRICTS OR MAYBE IT'S JUST DO THEIR COMMUNITY PROGRAM BUT THAT'S ANOTHER GREAT. PREVENTATIVE EFFORT I ALSO HAD A REALLY GOOD DISCUSSION LAST WEEK WITH THE COUNCILMAN. SHE'S OUT OF SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY AND THIS JUST TO KIND OF TOUCH ON THE BALL YOU'RE TO PROTECT. CONVERSATIONAL BEEN HAVING TODAY. THAT I HAVE SEEN IT A LOT YOU KNOW WHERE OU'RE GOING AND FAMILIES THAT COME INTO OUR SHELTER. UNFORTUNATELY BILL STILL HAVE THEIR CHILDREN REMOVED- WHILE THE INVESTIGATION IS ONGOING. AND THANKFULLY I'VE SEEN A LOT OF CHILDREN RETURNED TO THEIR FAMILY. BUT THE POINT IS THEY WERE SEPARATED FOR THOSE MONTHS AS THEY DID THEIR INVESTIGATION. AND I'VE EVEN UNFORTUNATELY SCENE WHERE THE CHILDREN GET SENT TO ABUSER. AND SO. I AM TALKING ABOUT THE TRAUMA DOES TO NOT ONLY THE CHILDREN BUT ALSO THE PARENT THE NON OFFENDING PARENT- THERE'S A LOT OF ROOM FOR GROWTH. AND SO THIS COUNCIL I MEAN YOU KNOW HER VISION AND I KNOW IT'S A FAR OFF VISION AS FAR AS HOW LONG IT'LL TAKETO COMPLETE BUT- SHE ENVISIONED THE FACILITY SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED FOR THOSE FAMILIES. YOU KNOW WHERE THERE DOES NEED TO BE ABOUT MONITORING BUT INSTEAD OF SEPARATING THE FAMILY THEY ALL GO INTO THIS PROGRAM. AND LIKE I SAID WE'VE HAD CLIENTS COME INTO OUR PROGRAM WHERE. THAT'S WHAT THEY WERE TOLD YOU KNOW IF YOU DON'T GO INTO THE SHELTER YOUR CHILDREN WILL BE REMOVED. AND SO THEY COMPLY. THEY COME TO THE SHELTER AND SOMEHOW THEY STILL END UP HAVING THE CHILDREN REMOVED. SO I THINK HAVING A FACILITY SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED FOR THOSE. TYPES OF FAMILIES WHERE THERE IS A LITTLE BIT MORE SEVERE. I HAVE A NEED TO KEEP THE MONITOR IT- THAT WOULD BE GREAT YOU KNOW SO AGAIN WE CAN DECREASE THE AMOUNT OF TIME HOURS SEPARATING CHILDREN. FROM NOT SUPPORTIVE PARENT. IN SOMETHING ELSE YOU KNOW THAT I'M ALSO HOPING TO SEE HAPPEN HERE IN CALIFORNIA. IS OUT OF OHIO. THEY ARE WORKING RIGHT NOW AND TRY TO TRYING TO ESTABLISH A BILL ONLINE. A STATE OF EMERGENCY ON CHILDHOOD TRAUMA. AND ESSENTIALLY IT'S TAKING THE MODEL OF WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC. WHERE THERE WAS DECLARED ON A STATE LEVEL AND THEN OF COURSE BACK THEN PRESIDENT TRUMP. WAS ABLE TO DO THAT ON A FEDERAL LEVEL WHICH DOES CREATE. A LOT MORE ACCESS TO- JUST DIFFERENT OPPORTUNITIES TO AGAIN HELP. AND I KNOW THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S COME UP TODAY IS THE PSYCHO EDUCATION AROUND TRAUMA. AND ESPECIALLY THE CYCLE EDUCATION AROUND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. SO BEING ABLE TO DECLARE TATE OF EMERGENCY ON CHILDHOOD TRAUMA I THINK WOULD HELP. YOU KNOW THE MESSAGE REALLY GET OUT THERE THAT IT'S VERY PRETTY BASES. AND I CANNOT LIVE A LOT OF THE WORK OUT OF CALIFORNIA I THINK IT IS REALLY PROGRESSIVE I THINK OUR FIRST SPEAKER SURE ABOUT TODAY. YOU KNOW THAT WE DO HAVE A LOT OF GREAT WORK BEING DONE- BUT I THINK THERE'S ALSO THE OPPORTUNITY THERE THAT IF WE DID SOMETHING LIKE THIS IN OTHER STATES. WOULD FOLLOW SUIT AND SO WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT. YOU KNOW THE ASU STUDY. AND WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT CHILDHOOD ADVERSITY AND HOW THAT SHOWS UP ON THE ADULT SIDE OF LIFE- THERE'S A LOT OF GREAT MOTIVATION AND REASONS WHY WE WOULD WANT TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS. WHETHER IT IS JUST TO KIND OF INCREASE. THE AWARENESS OF THE CYCLE EDUCATION. BUT ALSO LIKE I SAID SURPRISE POTENTIALLY ACCESS FUNDS SO THAT. WE CAN CONNECT MORE FAMILIES TO THE SERVICES THAT THEY NEED- SO HOPEFULLY YOU KNOW LIKE I SAID A LOT OF THESE PREVENTATIVE EFFORTS. WERE ABLE TO MAKE PROGRESS ON BUT- THAT'S WHAT I HAVE TO SHARE TODAY SO. THANK YOU GUYS AGAIN FOR THE TIME. AND- MY CONCERN IS VERY RICH XING. TO HEAR FROM THE OTHER PANEL IF. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TEST- ANY QUESTIONS FROM OUR MEMBERS. SENATOR KIRBY ADAMS THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I'M I'M NOT A QUESTION I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT THAT- I REALLY APPRECIATE THIS TESTIMONY THIS IS THE HOPEFUL PART OF IT- I WHAT I. EXPERIENCED AS DOING CRIMINAL DEFENSE WORK- AND WITH DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CASES OF- IS A LOT OF TIMES IT'S REALLY HARD TO FIGURE OUT. EXACTLY WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE FAMILY WITH THE DYNAMICS ARE AND THERE WEREN'T ANY INJURIES IT JUST PUSHING AND EVERYBODY. ENDED UP GETTING ARRESTED IN. AND I ALWAYS RECOMMENDED THAT DURING THE TIME THAT WE COULD DO IT- THAT IT MAY BE- EVERYBODY BE DIVERTED AND PUTTING IT INTO A PROGRAM TOGETHER SO THAT THEY COULD START WORKING OUT. WHATEVER THE ISSUES WERE THEY THAT THEY HAD BECAUSE THEY WANTED TO BE TOGETHER AND THEY CAME IN TOGETHER AND THEY WOULD COME IN TOGETHER AND SO THIS WHOLE IDEA THAT THERE ARE INSTANCES WHERE. PEOPLE JUST NEED TO LEARN HOW TO COMMUNICATE BETTER AND HOW TO- HELP HAVE A GOOD EXPRESSED ITS APPOINTMENT I MEAN IF THERE'S ONE PLACE. THAT YOU'RE LIKELY TO BE DISAPPOINTED MAD OR- FEELING SAD IS AN EMERITUS AND OR IN A RELATIONSHIP AND IF YOU CAN LEARN HOW TO EXPRESS YOURSELF THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT SO THESE. THESE KINDS OF THINGS THESE PROGRAMS ARE REALLY- GIVE ME HOPE THAT THERE'S- A WAY TO BE ABLE TO HELP PROBABLY A MAJORITY OF THE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE ARE- ARE EXPERIENCING THIS KIND OF STRESS AND TO BE ABLE TO LEARN HOW TO COMMUNICATE BETTER CHILDREN AS WELL. THIS IS HELP. ME TODAY. THANK YOU FOR THAT SENATOR SKINNER. THANK YOU TO REVIEW AND- THANK YOU- JONATHAN FOR THAT TESTIMONY- WHAT WHAT I WAS STRUCK BY IS JUST THAT. HOW MUCH MORE WE'RE UNDERSTANDING THAT. BOTH THE PERPETRATOR OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND THE VICTIM THERE PAST TRAUMA CONTRIBUTED TO THERE BEING IN THE CIRCUMSTANCE THE RENT TO THE VICTIMS STAYING IN THAT SITUATION BUT OF COURSE THERE'S MANY OTHER COMPLICATED FACTORS- BUT ALSO THE D. D. PERPETRATOR BECAUSE THE PERPETRATOR IT'S ENOUGH WHERE IT'S ALL POWER DYNAMICS AND IT'S- LIKE MAKING UP FOR A LACK OF POWER THEY FEEL. THEY FEEL IN THEIR OWN LIVES. AND THAT. WE OUR CARCERAL SYSTEM WHETHER G. OR PRISONS ARE IS REALLY STILL NOT DESIGNED TO DEAL WITH TRAUMA AND SO WHILE CLEARLY- WE HAVE. YOU KNOW PENAL CODE STATUTES AND SUCH DEAL THIS. IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY GET AT THE UNDERLYING NOW FOR SOME PEOPLE I THINK IT ABSOLUTELY MUST BE THERE. WITH THE CAR SERRATION IS A NECESSARY HOWEVER FOR MANY IT IT MAY JUST REALLY BE MORE THAT TRAUMA INFORMED CARE. AND IN SOME CASES MAYBE NOT TOGETHER IN OTHER CASES PERHAPS TOGETHER MEETING WITH THE TWO PEOPLE OR FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY. BUT OBVIOUSLY THE IMPACT ON THE CHILDREN IS MORE TRAUMA IN TRAUMA THAT THEN CAN PLAY OUT LATER IN THEIR LIVES SO. THE MORE WE CAN FOCUS THIS WHERE APPROPRIATE ON TRAUMA INFORMED CARE THE BETTER AND YET WE ARE WOEFULLY INADEQUATE IN PROVIDING RESOURCES FOR SUCH CARE AND HAVE STILL PRIMARILY RELIED ON THE CARCERAL SYSTEM SO. AGAIN ANY OF OUR PANELISTS SUGGESTIONS ON HOW WE CAN DO THAT BETTER- CLEARLY BUDGET IS ONE ISSUE BUT IT'S THERE'S OTHER FACTORS. TOO WE WELCOME THEM. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY- I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT TWO THINGS WE WILL CERTAINLY- THE MEMBERS OF THIS PANEL EXPLORED THE STATE OF EMERGENCY THAT YOU. ARE SUGGESTED AND ALSO STRUCK ME I MEAN I WAS A TEACHER AND I KNOW WE'RE MANDATED REPORTERS. BUT IT'S THE ASSUMPTION THAT WE ALL KNOW WHAT TO LOOK FOR AND UNDERSTAND WHAT TO REPORT SO I THINK MAYBE EXPLORING SPECIFIC EXAMPLES AND GUIDELINES FOR THOSE MANDATED REPORTERS CHAINMAIL AND BE ABLE TO REPORT WHEN NEEDED SOMETIMES WE SEE THINGS AND PERHAPS WE WILL NOT RECOGNIZE IT IF WE'VE NEVER BEEN IN A SITUATION. OR COME FROM A HOME THAT'S NEVER SEEN VIOLENCE SO VERY DIFFERENT SO THANK YOU AGAIN- WE WILL NOW MOVE OVER TO OUR SECOND PANELIST WE WILL HEAR FROM. MS LABONTE SHE IS. WITH THE CALIFORNIA ADVOCATES FOR CHILD EMPOWERMENT AND SAFETY. THE FLOOR IS YOURS. GOOD AFTERNOON HONORABLE MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT AND SPEAK TO YOU AND ISN'T VERY IMPORTANT MEETING. I AM ALSO REPRESENTING ANTS OUT FORMERLY THE- FOUNDING EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA PARTNERSHIP TO END DOMESTIC VIOLENCE THE STATE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE COALITION AND I THINK I KNOW SOME OF YOU FROM THAT WORK- I AM CURRENTLY WITH. A FIVE OH ONE C. FOR ASUS FOR KIDS WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT WE HAD TO FORM OF A NATIONAL COALITION OF ADVOCATES TO ENSURE THAT CHILD SAFETY IS A TOP PRIORITY IN FAMILY COURT. BUT I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN FIRST WITH THE STORY OF CLEAR TEMP LOCAL. ON OCTOBER TWENTY SECOND TWO THOUSAND CLEAR ATTEMPT ON GOAL WAS BRUTALLY MURDERED BY HER EX BOYFRIEND TYREE RAMIREZ. RAMIREZ STABBED CLEAR TO DEATH IN HER HOME IN FRONT OF HER TWO YOUNG CHILDREN. OUR TEN YEAR OLD SON. AND HER FOUR YEAR OLD DAUGHTER. THIS WAS ONE OF THE WORST DOMESTIC VIOLENCE INCIDENTS THAT SHOOK SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA AND THE ENTIRE STATE. WHY BECAUSE DESPITE OVER ONE HUNDRED LAWS IN THE BOOKS ON DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PREVENTION ALL OUR SYSTEMS HAD FAILED TO PROTECT CLAIRE AND HER VULNERABLE CHILDREN. LIKE MOST DOMESTIC VIOLENCE HOMICIDES CLEAR ATTEMPT ON GOAL DEATH WAS COMPLETELY PREDICTABLE AND PREVENTABLE FOR MORE THAN EIGHTEEN MONTHS SHE HAD COMPLETE SHE HAD REPEATEDLY CALLED SAN FRANCISCO POLICE TO REPORT RAMIREZ'S VIOLENCE AND THREATS AGAINST HER. AGAIN AND AGAIN SHE TOLD OFFICERS OF THE ESCALATING VIOLENCE HER FEARS FOR HERSELF AND HER CHILDREN AND HER DESIRE TO TALK TO YOU IN THE OFFICE BE ARRESTED AND PROSECUTED. HOWEVER THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN CLEAR AGAIN CALLED POLICE TO HER APARTMENT REPORTING ROMEO ASSIST TERRORIST THREATS AND TELLING THE DISPATCHER THAT RAMIREZ HAD A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE WITH HER AND THAT SHE WAS SCARED HE WAS GOING TO HURT HER CLEAR SHOW THE OFFICERS THE EMERGENCY PROTECTIVE ORDER FROM A SEPTEMBER FIRST INCIDENT WHICH HAD NOT BEEN SERVED. THE POLICE FILED A QUOTE UNQUOTE TERRORIST THREATS REPORT YET RAMIREZ WAS ARRESTED AND BOOKED ONLY ON PUBLIC INTOXICATION INTOXICATION AND PROVIDING FALSE IDENTIFICATION TO POLICE. THERE WAS NO REFERENCE ON BOOKING PAPER STORE EMERITUS THREATS OR HIS HISTORY OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE MURDER RAMIREZ APPEARED IN COURT FOR A REVOCATION OF PROBATION HEARING ON THE OCTOBER NINETY NINE CHARGE OF VIOLATING HIS PROBATION BY DIPPING INTO A PUBLIC RESTROOM. NO MENTION WAS MADE OF THE PREVIOUS DOMESTIC VIOLENCE INCIDENTS BY THE DA ACCORDING TO JUDGE LILLIAN SING PROBATION WAS SENTENCED TO THIRTY DAYS IN SHERIFF'S WORK ALTERNATIVE PROGRAM. IN ORDER TO REPORT TO THE JAIL ON NOVEMBER FIRST HOWEVER. THAT ON OCTOBER TWENTY SECOND THAT WAS THE DAY HE BRUTALLY STABBED CLAIRE TEMPLE GO OVER SEVENTEEN TIMES IN FRONT OF RITUAL VALUABLE CHILDREN. I SHARE THAT STORY. CAUSE OF DEATH ROW THE NICE THE BAY AREA COMMUNITY AND ALSO FEATURES SHOWED US WHY DESPITE SOME OF OUR LAWS IN THE BOOKS THINGS CONTINUED TO FAIL US. AND WE WERE ASKED A DISPENSER CAN PANEL TO SHARE HOW WE CAN IMPROVE OUTCOMES FOR CHILDREN VICTIMS AND FAMILIES. I THINK THE VERY FIRST PROBLEM AND MANY HAVE BEEN I'VE SPOKEN TO THIS ALREADY BUT I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT IT THAT CHILD VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. NOT ONLY S. WITNESSES BUT DIRECTLY INJURED ARE NOT PROTECTED IN FAMILY COURT. NATIONAL RESEARCH BY GERALDINE STALEY PHD FOUND THAT OVER 85% OF CALIFORNIA MOTHERS WHO CAME TO COURT. TO PROTECT THEIR CHILDREN LOST PRIMARY CUSTODY. THE IDENTIFIED ABUSIVE PARENTS LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS SOCIAL WORKERS MEDIATORS CUSTODY EVALUATORS ATTORNEYS FOR THE CHILDREN AND JUDGES MINIMIZED DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND CHILD ABUSE GIVING THE EXCUSE AND SOME CONVICTED FATHERS UNSUPERVISED ACCESS TO CHILDREN. THAT MUST STOP 73% OF CALIFORNIA CHILDREN REPORTED THAT THEY WERE RE INJURED AND SOME HAVE BEEN KILLED. THESE FINDINGS REPLICATE OTHER NATIONAL STUDIES. ARMED WITH CALIFORNIA PROTECTIVE PARENTS JUST- ON A NATIONAL A STATEWIDE ORGANIZATION AND GOT A CENTER FOR JUDICIAL EXCELLENCE ALSO HAS A U. S. DIVORCE HOMICIDE CHILD HOMICIDES THAT IS ON THEIR WEBSITES. I THINK THE SECOND ISSUE THAT I HAVE ALREADY BEEN ALLUDED TO EARLIER BUT I WANT TO GIVE CREDENCE TO SOME OF THE TRAININGS THAT HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED OVER THE YEARS. IS THAT THERE IS ANY NEED FOR STANDARDIZED AND SPECIALIZED TRAINING BY DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND CHILD ABUSE SPECIALISTS FOR ALL COURT OFFICIALS NOT JUST FOR JUDGE THIS. THE NATIONAL COUNCIL ON JUVENILE AND FAMILY COURT JUDGES DOES AN AMAZING CONFERENCE EVERY YEAR AND ALSO- PROVIDES TRAININGS DOMESTIC VIOLENCE EXPERTS AND ADVOCATES THAT ALL NEED TO WORK TOGETHER. SO AT THE STATE LEVEL IF WE COULD HAVE THOSE STANDARDIZED TRAINING CONDUCTED. BY DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND CHILD ABUSE SPECIALIST FOR ALL COURT OFFICIALS WOULD REALLY HELP. WE WILL BE PRESENTING FEW TO SPECIFIC LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS WHICH I WON'T. GO INTO IT BUT JUST BRIEFLY MENTION OUR FIRST RECOMMENDATION IS BECAUSE OF THE ISSUE THE ISSUE BEING VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ARE ENDANGERED AND INTIMIDATED IN FAMILY COURTS. VICTIMS ARE COERCED INTO MEDIATING WITH ABUSERS FACE TO FACE DESPITE RULE OF COURT FIVE POINT TWO ONE FIVE. VICTIMS ARE NOT GIVEN TIME TO LEAVE COURT ROOMS BEFORE ABUSERS. EVEN WHEN THEY HAVE A RESTRAINING ORDER. VICTIMS ARE ORDERED TO MAKE CUSTODY EXCHANGES WITHOUT PROTECTION EVEN WHEN THEY HAVE A RESTRAINING ORDER. OUR PROPOSED SOLUTION IS TO AMEND PENAL CODE SECTION TWO SIX FOUR POINT TWO AND FINALLY COLD. SECTION THREE ONE EIGHT ONE. THAT WILL BE SUBMITTED TO YOU IN WRITING- BUT I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT WHY THAT'S IMPORTANT OUR COALITION OF ADVOCATES FIRST A PARTY'S REQUEST FOR SEPARATE SESSIONS IS NOT EVIDENCE OF HIS OR HER LACK OF COOPERATION WITH THE PROCESS WE WILL HIGHLIGHT THAT IN THE LANGUAGE CHANGE THAT WE WILL PROPOSE. SECOND IF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS DISCOVERED AFTER MEDIATION ARE YOU VALUATION HAS BEGUN THE PARTIES SHALL BE TOLD SEPARATELY ABOUT SAFETY RELATED ISSUES. AND THE OPTION OF CONTINUING IN SEPARATE SESSIONS AT SEPARATE TIMES THESE INCREASING INCREASES SAFETY FACTORS. THIRD THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF EACH PARTY STEIN'S ARRIVAL DEPARTURE AND MEETING SHALL BE PROTECTED. AND FOURTH ANY PARTY WHO REQUESTED SEPARATE MEDIATION SESSIONS DUE TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SHALL BE ASKED TO LEAVE THE COURT FIFTEEN MINUTES BEFORE THE ACCUSED OFFENDER IF THEY MUST APPEAR TOGETHER IN PERSON FOR A HEARING POINT OUT TO A LEGISLATIVE FIX IN EVIDENCE CODE SEVEN THIRTY. WHEN FAMILIES HAVE RESOURCES. FAMILY COURTS FREQUENTLY APPOINT PRIVATE CUSTODY EVALUATORS UNDER EVIDENCE CODE SEVEN THIRTY THE COURT THE COURT RARELY PAYS FOR THE EVALUATION EVEN THOUGH THE APPOINTMENT IS FOR THE COURTS NEEDS. THIS ADDRESSES WHAT SENATOR COUPLE GYRO HAS THAT NOT EVERY FAMILY ENTERS THE COURT IN THE SAME WAY. PARENTS ARE REQUIRED TO PAY THE UNREGULATED AND OFTEN COSTLY FEES DIRECTLY TO WITH THE EVALUATOR. THE PARENTS THEN WITH THE MOST RESOURCES MAY PAY MORE OR ALL OF THE FEES THEREBY RAISING CONCERNS OF IMMEDIATE POSSIBLE BIAS. THIS DOES NOT OCCUR IN CRIMINAL AND JUVENILE COURTS. THESE AMENDMENTS WOULD ENSURE THAT COMPENSATION FOR A PRIVATE CUSTODY EVALUATION IS MADE BY THE COURT NOT THE LITIGANTS SO WE WILL PRESENT TO USE SPECIFIC LANGUAGE AMENDING CODES. EVIDENCE CODE SEVEN THIRTY AND SEVEN THIRTY ONE. I ADDITIONAL STATE LEVEL- IDEAS THAT WE'D LIKE TO PROPOSE IS THAT. MEDIATORS AND EVALUATORS NEED TO DO IN DANGER ASSESSMENTS FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE DEFENSE RYAN I BELIEVE HIM I'M TALK ABOUT THIS A LITTLE BIT HOW DO WE SCALE AND REACH ASSESS THE LEVEL OF DANGER. AND SO WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO DO THOSE DANGER ASSESSMENTS FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIMS. AGAIN DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIMS SHOULD NEVER HAVE TO BE MEDIATE FACE TO FACE WITH THEIR ABUSERS. OR LEAVE THE COURT AT THE SAME TIME. AT LEAST DANGEROUS AND INTIMIDATING OUTCOMES HAPPEN FREQUENTLY IN COURT. ALL FAMILY COURT PROCEEDINGS HEARINGS NEED TO BE RECORDED BY EITHER A COURT REPORTER ARE ELECTRONICALLY MORE AND MORE SOME COURTS ARE DOING THIS IN DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS BECAUSE IT REQUIRES ADDITIONAL FUNDING FROM THE ON THE COUNTY OR THE STATE. ANOTHER IDEA IS- ANY DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIM WHO WAS SELF REPRESENTED WHILE THE BATTER HAS AN ATTORNEY SHOULD RECEIVE A PRO BONO ATTORNEY OR HAVE AN ATTORNEY PAID BY THE OTHER PARTY AS REQUIRED. AND THEN A THIRD ANOTHER THING IS THE RECENT LEGISLATION WHICH THAT WAS A B. ELEVEN SIXTY NINE BY ASSEMBLYWOMAN BLANCA RUBIO- REQUIRES A FORM FOR CORD CONNECTED PROFESSIONALS TO FOLLOW THE PROPER PROTOCOL FOR INVESTIGATING CHILD ABUSE CASES AND BRING FACTS AND EVIDENCE TO THE COURT BUT MORE WORK IS NEEDED TO ENSURE THE FORM IS PROPERLY UTILIZED. OUR ADVOCATES HAD TRIED FOR OVER FIFTEEN YEARS TO GET A FORM TO IMPLEMENT ANALLY CODE. THIRTY ONE EIGHTEEN IT TOOK THE HORRIBLE DEATH OF LITTLE PC AND HIS MOTHER ANA ESTEVEZ ADVOCACY AND ASSEMBLYWOMAN RUBIO STRONG ADVOCACY. BUT THIS THE COURT STILL USE EVIDENCE CODE SEVEN THIRTY EACH APPOINT EXPENSIVE PSYCHOLOGIST TO DO MENTAL HEALTH TESTING WHEN THERE ARE ALLEGATIONS OF CHILD ABUSE SPECIALLY CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE. THIS NEVER TURNS OUT WELL FOR ADULT AND CHILD VICTIMS BUT THE COURT MAKES THE PARENTS STAYED UP PROFESSIONAL DIRECTLY SO IT ONLY APPLIES WHEN ONE PARENT HAS LOTS OF RESOURCES. WE ARE ALSO AWARE OF GENDER BIAS AGAINST WOMEN IN COURTS MANY STUDIES HAVE BEEN. DONE AROUND THAT. THEY DO THIS INSTEAD OF ORDERING- ORDERING AN INVESTIGATION UNDER FAMILY CODE THIRTY ONE EIGHTEEN AND USING THE EVIDENCE BASED PROTOCOL AND YOU FORM. THE DEEPER ISSUES ARE DEAF FRIENDLY PARENTS LOST THAT LEAN THE CORD TOWARD SHARED PARENTING DESPITE THE VIOLENCE AND I THINK THIS IS WHERE WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT. ALL THOSE WORKING IN THE COURTS IN OUR LEGAL AND LAW ENFORCEMENT SYSTEMS ARE REALLY AWARE OF THAT THE LEAST VALIDATE THE SITUATION SO THAT WE CAN PROTECT BOTH THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SURVIVOR. AND THE. THE CHILD OR CHILDREN. AT THE LOK AT THE LOCAL LEVEL- WE WERE ALSO I WAS ALSO ASKED TO PRESENT- WHAT CAN BE DONE. THE COURT WATCH IT'S AN EXCELLENT LOCAL ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURE. CALIFORNIA PROTECTIVE PARENTS HAS DEVELOPED A METHOD USING COLLEGE STUDENTS ESCORT WATCHERS AGAIN I WILL SEND THAT TO YOU- WHEN- WE COMPLETE THIS HEARING. MULTI DISCIPLINARY INTERVIEW CENTERS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL SOME COUNTIES AND SOME NON PROFITS ALREADY HAVE THE BEST. INTERVIEW CENTERS FOR INTER BEING ALL ABUSED CHILDREN ARE CRUCIAL. GIVING COURT APPOINTED SPECIAL ADVOCATES SERVICES TO CHILDREN IN FAMILY COURT IN ADDITION TO JUVENILE COURT WOULD BE A GREAT HELP CASTEL WAS ALSO MENTIONED EARLIER BY SENATOR COUPLE YET I BELIEVE- AND MANY OF YOU ARE AWARE OF FAMILY JUSTICE CENTERS WITH COLOCATED. SERVICES WHICH TOGETHER WOULD GIVE VICTIMS A ONE STOP SHOP FOR SERVICES SAN DIEGO HAS A VERY NICE MODEL AS WELL AS ALAMEDA COUNTY. I THEN HAVING SPECIALIZED LAW ENFORCEMENT UNITS TO INVESTIGATE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND CHILD ABUSE HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE EFFECTIVE. ACTUALLY IF THEY CHARGE MULTIPLE CRIMES THEY NEED TO BE THE LEAD AGENCY IN ALL CRIME INVESTIGATIONS CHILD WELFARE SERVICES SOCIAL WORKERS SHOULD NOT CALL. THE ACCUSED BEFORE LAW ENFORCEMENT INTERROGATION. ANOTHER LOCAL APPROACH COULD BE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ADVOCATES SHOULD BE IN THE COURTROOM AND PART OF THE FAMILY COURT PROCESS TO ENSURE VICTIMS ARE SUPPORTED AND THE COURT DOES NOT MINIMIZE VIOLENCE THEY WOULD BE THE ICING YOURS ON BEHALF OF THE VICTIMS AND ALSO WOULD SERVE THAT LEVEL OF- TRAINING THAT THEY HAVE RECEIVED AROUND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. AND I THINK THIS WILL ADDRESS THAT THE PROTECTING THE CHILDREN I EVEN FURTHER IF A CHILD TWELVE OR OLDER WISHES TO FILE A RESTRAINING ORDER AGAINST APPEARANCE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ADVOCATES COULD HELP IN THAT PROCESS IN MANY OF THE SHELTERS- WHICH WERE MEMBERS OF THIS CALIFORNIA STATE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE COALITION BACK IN THE DAY WHEN I. SERVICE ITS FOUNDING EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR. THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ADVOCATES AT THE SHELTERS WERE STILL STRAPPED FINANCIALLY OFTEN AND THEY HAVE TO ONLY FOCUS ON THE SURVIVORS. PEOPLE WHO HAVE FLED THEIR HOMES BUT NOW THINGS ARE EASING UP AND THAT WE NEED TO ENCOURAGE THEM TO REALLY FOCUS ON THE CHILDREN TO HELP THEM ALSO FILED A RESTRAINING ORDER AGAINST THE PARENTS. ON THIS AGAIN FURTHER ADDRESSES SENATOR COUPLE YEARS. EARLIER DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ADVOCATES COULD HELP CHILDREN PROVIDES THEIR WISHES FOR CUSTODY AND VISITATION. ANY VIEWS FOURTEEN OR OLDER WISH TO TESTIFY DIRECTLY TO THE COURTS. ADVOCATES COULD HELP THEM REPAIR. ENSURE THEY DO NOT HAVE TO TESTIFY IN OPEN COURT. AND ASKED TO BE WITH THEM AS A SUPPORT PERSON. THIS IS SOCCER PRACTICE A BEST PRACTICE THAT WE NEED TO START- MAKING SURE WE IMPLEMENTED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL MR BOND OUT WE HAVE FILE ABOUT ONE MORE MINUTE- THANK YOU. I WILL BE ENDING SOON THE MYSTIC VIOLENCE ADVOCATES WELL FOR SOCIAL WORKERS NEED TO WORK CLOSELY WITH EACH OTHER IN THE FAMILY COURTS THERE HAS ALWAYS BEEN A BIT OF A SILO. AND SEPARATION BETWEEN DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND CHILD WELFARE ORGANIZATIONS THAT IS NEEDS TO COME TOGETHER AND THE FINAL THING- TWO FINAL POINTS THAT I WANT TO BRING UP IS THE FIVE THE MAIN OTHER SOLUTIONS ON PRIMARY PREVENTION- FOCUSING ON PREVENTING FIRST TIME PERPETRATION AND FIRST TIME VICTIMIZATION. CALIFORNIA ALREADY STARTED THIS THE. CENTERS OF DISEASE CONTROL CALLED DELTA. ARE YOUR AUDIO WHEN OFF OUT DO YOU MIND PAUSING FOR A SECOND. SORRY IF WE CAN FOCUS ON THOSE CELLS PREVENTING OR SOME PERPETRATION FIRST I'M VICTIMIZATION AND REDUCING RISK FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE AND PROMOTING PROTECTIVE FACTORS THAT REDUCE THE LIKELIHOOD OF INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE- AND THEN FINALLY THIS IS ALREADY ONE OF THE SUCCESSES OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ORGANIZATIONS IS THE COORDINATED COMMUNITY RESPONSES OR CC ARE. ADDRESSING INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND THEY MUST BUT THEY MUST INCLUDE MAKING CHILD SAFETY A HIGHER PRIORITY. ON THE ISSUE OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND CHILD SAFETY IS NOT JUST AN INTERSECTION TO ME IT'S NOT CO OCCURRENCE BECAUSE THAT VIOLENCE IS OCCURRING AND THEN BECOMES PERPETRATED OVER TIME. AND WHILE I'M AT IT I WOULD LIKE TO ALSO. I WORKED NOW FORCED HEALING CENTER IS THAT ARE BAD WHILE OUR BATTER INTERVENTION PROGRAMS HAVE COME A LONG WAY THERE'S MUCH TO BE DONE TO GREAT- TO MAKE SURE MOST PERPETRATORS- HAVE. WE KNOW THAT MOST PERPETRATORS HAVE BECOME- BEEN VICTIMS THEMSELVES AS CHILDREN HAVE NOT HEALED THE PROMISE OF YOUR PAST OR OVERCOME THE VIOLENCE LEARN FROM THEIR FAMILIES THEIR COMMUNITIES. AND THAT. THERE IS MUCH TO BE DONE TO CREATE A MORAL CONFLICTS ON AN INDIVIDUAL PRIOR TO COMMITTING AN ACT OF VIOLENCE THIS CAN ONLY BE ACHIEVED. THROUGH A DEEPER LOOK AT ONCE SPIRITUAL AND MORAL COMPASS. FOR FINALLY I WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE AND COMMEND THE CODE COMMITTEE FOR TACKLING THIS OFTEN NEGLECTED AND FORGOTTEN CO OCCURRENCE OF CHILD ABUSE AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE US POLICYMAKERS. WE AND OUR HAVE BOTH THE PRIVILEGE AND POWER TO INSTITUTE LEGISLATIVE CHANGES FOR ASSISTANCE WITH FOR. REFORM TO ENSURE SAFETY FOR ALL CALIFORNIA HAS CREAM YOUR ORGANIZATIONS- THE FUTURES WITHOUT VIOLENCE THAT WAS MENTIONED BY JONATHAN CENTERS FOR JUDICIAL EXCELLENCE CALIFORNIA PROTECTIVE. PARENTS ASSOCIATION AND THE CALIFORNIA STATE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE COALITION THOSE STATE ORGANIZATIONS AND ADVOCATES MUST BE USED UTILIZED BY THE- STATE LEGISLATURE US YOUR SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS THAT YOU CAN RELY ON. TO BE ABLE TO. HELP CHANGE LAWS ENACT NEW ONES AND MAKE SURE THINGS ARE THOSE LAWS ARE PROPERLY IMPLEMENTATION INSURE SAFETY FOR BOTH CHILDREN. AND WOMEN. VICTIMS THANK YOU. THE YOU SO MUCH FOR TESTING AND ONE RECOMMEND. CENTER SKINNER AND QUESTIONS. THE TRAGEDIES THAT YOU DESCRIBED ARE. BEYOND- BEYOND COMPREHENSION THE WE KNOW UNFORTUNATELY. THEY MAY NOT EVEN HAD THE ARMS. OUR VARIOUS MECHANISMS WORK IT'S POSSIBLE AND WE'VE SEEN IT BEFORE. THAT PERPETRATORS VIOLATE OD RESTRAINING ORDERS AND SUCH THOUGH CERTAINLY WHEN WE HAVE TOOLS AND THEY ARE NOT USED IT IS. YEAH IT IS WRONG AND THAT WOMEN'S COMPLAINTS LIKE THIS ARE NOT TAKEN SERIOUSLY IS SOMETHING THAT WE KNOW AND WE HAVE SEEN REPEATED AND HEARD DOCUMENTED REPEATED CIRCUMSTANCES SO WE NEED TO DO BETTER THERE BUT THEN YOU HAD MANY OTHER CONCRETE RECOMMENDATIONS WHICH I REALLY APPRECIATE IT YOU'RE GOING TO BE PROVIDED TO US IN WRITING SO I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY AND WE OBVIOUSLY ARE COMMITTED TO WORKING ON DOING BETTER. AND ONCE AGAIN THANK YOU AND I SPOKE ABOUT A CASE OF HONEST OF US WHO LOST HER LITTLE BOY PICKY WAS FIVE YEARS OLD- SHE'S FROM MY CITY AND- AND A FRIEND AND IT WAS UNFORTUNATE THAT SHE SPOKE UP SO MANY TIMES AND NO ONE WOULD LISTEN AND AT THE END SHE LOST HER LITTLE BOY TO. TEAR HER ABUSER- BECAUSE THE COURT FAILED HERSELF THANK YOU AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS HAVE YOU CAN EMAIL US WE WOULD LOVE TO HAVE THOSE POP ANDI NEED TO APOLOGIZE A LOT TO THE LAST PRESENTER WE DID HAVE TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES AT THE VERY BEGINNING SO I'M GOING TO ASK EAST YOU MIGHT HEAR TESTIMONY AS WE HAVE ANOTHER COMMITTEE HEARING AFTER THIS- SO I WOULD LIKE TO WELCOME MRS DUDLEY TAILORED THAT NEEDS. A DIRECT THAT UCLA PROFESSOR CENTER FOR STRENGTHENING CHILDREN AND FAMILIES ARE. WELCOME AND THE FLOOR IS YOURS. THANK YOU SO MUCH MADAM. HONORABLE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY. LAST YEAR WE COMMISSIONED A STUDY ON THE CONNECTION BETWEEN DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND CHILD WELFARE. WHICH I WILL REVIEW SHORTLY. TODAY GIVEN THE TIME CONSTRAINTS I'M GOING TO FOCUS ON THE RECOMMENDATIONS AND OFF THE TOP FRAME THIS DISCUSSION YOU'RE AN EQUITY LENS. AS SENATOR CAFIERO RAISED AND HIGHLIGHT HOW SOME OTHER STATES ARE ALSO ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE. I'D ALSO LIKE TO QUICKLY SHARE SOME SLIDES THAT WILL HELP ME. STAY ON TRACK ONE MOMENT PLEASE. AT UCLA WE ACKNOWLEDGE OUR PRESENCE ON THE TRADITIONAL ANCESTRAL AND UNCEDED TERRITORY OF THE GABRIELINO TONGVA PEOPLE. THE UCLA PRITZKER CENTER IS A MULTI DISCIPLINARY CENTER AT UCLA DESIGNED TO ADDRESS. AND PREVENT CHILDREN FROM ENTERING THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM AS THIS GROUP KNOWS DOMESTIC VIOLENCE FEEDS THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM TO A LARGE EXTENT AND OUR QUESTION HAS BEEN HOW TO MAKE IT STOP. FOR THOSE CURRENTLY IN FOSTER CARE BECAUSE OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WE'VE ASKED HOW FAMILIES CAN BE REUNIFIED AND SUPPORTED WITH PROPER SERVICES FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. I'LL PROVIDE A QUICK OVERVIEW OF THE STUDY THAT WE CONDUCTED WAGON NOT NEXT CHILDREN COMPRISE THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM AT AN ALARMING AND DISPROPORTIONATE RATE. THE CONFLUENCE OF POVERTY AND RACIAL TRAUMA COMPOUND AND MAKE THIS MORE LIKELY AND YET UNACCEPTABLE. NEVER THE LESS WE SEE CHILDREN REMOVED FROM THEIR HOMES AND PLACED IN FOSTER CARE FOR ISOLATED ALLEGATIONS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. THIS CAN RESULT IN FURTHER TRAUMA FOR BOTH THE SURVIVOR AND THE CHILDREN AS HAS BEEN DISCUSSED AT LENGTH. OUR WORK EXAMINES THIS DILEMMA AND THE IMPORT OF CHILD SAFETY COUPLED WITH THE CHALLENGES OF FAMILY SEPARATION BY THE ANTI ENGINEER TRANSCRIPTOMICS FOUNDATION THAT I STRATEGIES AND THE BLUE SHIELD FOUNDATION OF CALIFORNIA. WE WERE ALSO PLEASED TO THIS WORK WITH A NUMBER OF PARTNERS ACROSS LA COUNTY INCLUDING LA COUNTY DOMESTIC VIOLENCE COUNCIL EASIER FASTER. AND MANY TV AND HOW WELFARE GROUPS. OUR RESEARCH CONSISTED OF OVER FIFTY FOCUS GROUPS AND INDIVIDUAL INTERVIEWS THE SURVIVORS OF PARENTS AND FORMER FOSTER YOUTH SOCIAL WORKERS LAWYERS COMMUNITY LEADERS JUDGES POLICYMAKERS. AND PERPETRATORS WE ALSO CONDUCTED A WRITTEN SURVEY THAT RECEIVED OVER TWO HUNDRED RESPONSES. AMONG THESE INDIVIDUALS WE SPOKE WITH PRACTITIONERS IN OTHER STATES INCLUDING NEW YORK WASHINGTON NEBRASKA AND NEVADA. THESE CONVERSATIONS INFORMED OUR LEGAL RESEARCH AND THE APPROACHES THAT OTHER JURISDICTIONS TAKE TO ADDRESS DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND CHILD WELFARE. AS PART OF THE LEGAL RESEARCH WE ALSO COMPLETED A FIFTY STATE SURVEY TO UNDERSTAND HOW OTHER JURISDICTIONS ADDRESS DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND FOSTER CARE I'M PLEASED TO SHARE THAT SURVEY WITH THIS HONORABLE COMMITTEE. FOR ITS REVIEW. FOR SOME CONTACTS LOS ANGELES COUNTY HAS THE MOST CHILDREN IN FOSTER CARE IN THE COUNTRY. AS OF OCTOBER TWENTY TWENTY OVER HALF NINETEEN THOUSAND OF THE THIRTY SIX THOUSAND CHILDREN IN FOSTER CARE I'VE BEEN EXPOSED TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. IF THIS ISSUE THAT THIS BODY IS ADDRESSING TO DIAPER MEANINGFULLY ADDRESSED IMAGINE THE REDUCTION TO CHILD WELFARE INVOLVED FAMILIES AND HEALING THAT COULD OCCUR INSTEAD NUMBER OF RECOMMENDATIONS TO HELP ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. I WAS GOING TO SHOW A VIDEO BUT IN THE INTEREST OF TIME I'M GOING TO SKIP IT. TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE BALANCE OF POWER BETWEEN REMOVAL AND EXPOSURE TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WE DIDN'T EXTENSIVE LITERATURE REVIEW. WE LEARNED THAT BOTH EXPERIENCES REMOVAL FROM THE FAMILY AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CONSTITUTE WHAT IS KNOWN AS AN ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCE. EXPOSURE TO ACES CAN CAUSE IT'S WRONG OR TOXIC STRESS RESPONSE YOU HAVE A LASTING. NEGATIVE IMPACT ON HEALTH. NOT JUST DURING CHILDHOOD BUT WELL INTO ADULTHOOD. BECAUSE OF THAT WE ARE ENCOURAGING THIS BODY AND THE INVOLVED AGENCIES TO CONSIDER THE BALANCE OF POWER WHEN CONSIDERING REMOVAL BECAUSE OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. I'D LIKE TO START BY GOING ARE GOING OVER OUR FIRST RECOMMENDATION RELATING TO MANDATORY REPORTING SOMETHING THAT THIS AUDIENCE IS FAMILIAR WITH BUT WHAT OUR RESEARCH REVEALED IS THAT BECAUSE OF MANDATORY REPORTING AND SYSTEMIC RACISM AND OVERHAUL IS REQUIRED WITH RESPECT HOW WE SUPPORT AND SERVE. AS A FAMILY DISCLOSES THAT THEY'RE EXPERIENCING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WHEN TRYING TO GET HELP OR CARE IT CAN LEAD TO DCFS INVOLVEMENT. EVEN WHEN NOT SEEKING FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE A FAMILY MAN COUNTER SEVERAL MANDATED REPORTERS THROUGHOUT THEIR DAILY LIVES. FAMILIES OF COLOR AND LOW INCOME FAMILIES IN PARTICULAR ENCOUNTER ENCOUNTER MANDATED REPORTERS AT A GREATER RATE AND ARE THE SUBJECT OF MORE RECORDS THAN WHITE FAMILIES OR FAMILIES WITH SOCIOECONOMIC MEANS. ANGEL BY ALSO IMPACTS SOCIAL WORKERS INVESTIGATION AND NEEDS MORE FAMILIES OF COLOR ENSURING THE SYSTEM. BECAUSE SURVIVORS MAY FREQUENTLY INTERACTED MANDATED REPORTERS THAN USUAL PRESSURED TO HIDE THE FACT THAT THEY ARE EXPERIENCING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. THIS CONUNDRUM IS OFTEN WHAT IMPACTS THE SURVIVORS LATER IN THEIR DEPENDENCY CASE AND IS USED AGAINST THEM TO DEMONSTRATE THEIR FAILURE TO PROTECT. FOR THIS REASON MANDATORY SUPPORTING HAS BEEN PUT FORWARD AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO MANDATORY REPORTING. UNDER A MANDATORY SUPPORTING PRACTICE WE CAN CALL DCFS AND HOPE THAT IT DOESN'T NEED TO INVESTIGATION AND PROVIDE SERVICES INSTEAD. THE CALL CAN ALSO BE MADE BUT IT JUST CHANGES WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THAT CALL BY STEPPING BACK AND ASKING OURSELVES DOES THIS FAMILY SIMPLY NEED HELP. IT IS THEREFORE RECOMMENDED THAT THIS BODY CONSIDER REVIEWING MANDATORY REPORTING LAWS AND HOW THEY COMPOUND AND EXACERBATE THIS ISSUE AND EVALUATE THE POSSIBILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH MANDATORY REPORTING. IN TERMS OF THE SECOND RECOMMENDATION TRAINING ON DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS NEEDED FOR PROFESSIONALS INVOLVED IN CHILD WELFARE I UNDERSTAND THE POWER AND CONTROL DYNAMICS AND THE TRAUMA EXPERIENCED BY SURVIVORS. THE CURRENT LACK OF TRAINING CAN RESULT IN DECISION MAKERS AUTHORITIES NOT BELIEVING SURVIVORS NOT UNDERSTANDINGTHE DYNAMICS OF POWER AND CONTROL CAN LEAD TO A DECISION MAKER BLAMING SURVIVORS FOR NOT LEAVING A DV SITUATION AND I'M WILLINGNESS OR AN INABILITY TO RECOGNIZE PROTECTIVE PARENTING CAPACITY WHICH IS A SURVIVOR OFTEN DEMONSTRATES. IT IS THEREFORE RECOMMENDED THAT THIS BODY CONSIDER TRAINING REQUIREMENTS ACROSS THE ENERGY ENTITIES WORKING WITH FAMILY INCLUDING THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM AND THE COURTS WITH THE TRAUMA INFORMED FOCUS AS OUTLINED BY MR REX. IN TERMS OF THE THIRD RECOMMENDATION IT FOLLOWS THAT TRAINING AND A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WOULD LEND ITSELF TO MORE NUANCED SERVICE RECOMMENDATIONS. THE LIKELIHOOD OF REUNIFICATION AND REDUCE RECIDIVISM MORE NUANCED APPROACH TO SERVICES SHOULD BE DEVELOPED AND MORE TARGETED AND EFFECTIVE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SERVICE SHOULD BE PROVIDED. THESE SERVICES SHOULD ALSO BE PROVIDED TO FAMILIES FOR FREE OF CHARGE AND IN A CULTURALLY COMPETENT MANNER SERVICES ARE FUNDED PURSUANT TO CONTRACTS WITH VARIOUS COUNTY AGENCIES WE LEARNED AFTER INTERVIEWING A NUMBER OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ORGANIZATIONS THEY WERE NOT CONTRACTORS WITH THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM DESPITE SERVICE DELIVERY. DCFS INVOLVED FAMILIES THIS ARRANGEMENT SHOULD BE EVALUATED TO ENSURE EQUITY LINE SERVICE PROVIDERS SUPPORTING DCFS FAMILY. AND ADDRESS THE OFTEN HARSH FINANCIAL REALITIES THAT SO MANY TV ORGANIZATION SPACE. IS THEREFORE RECOMMENDED THAT THIS BODY CONSIDER HOW FUNDING IS ALLOCATED AND DIRECTED AT THE SERVICES AND ASSESS WHAT DEGREE THE SERVICE THAT ACTUALLY HELP FAMILIES AVOID. REMOVAL AND PROMOTE REUNIFICATION. I KNOW I LIKE TO TALK BRIEFLY ABOUT SPECIALIZATION IS THE LACK OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WITHIN CHILD WELFARE SYSTEMS. WE RECOMMEND THAT THE DEPARTMENT CONSIDER A SPECIALIZED SOCIAL WORKER OR A NUMBER OF THEM THAT CAN ACTUALLY ADDRESS DOMESTIC VIOLENCE HERE IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY I'M PLEASED TO SHARE BUT IT APPEARS. THE CSS IS NOW GOING TO IMPLEMENT THIS PRACTICE UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF SUPERVISOR JOEL. WE'RE PARTICULARLY INSPIRED BY SAN FRANCISCO DEPARTMENT OF CHILDREN YOUTH AND FAMILIES WHICH EMPLOYS A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SPECIALIST IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE RILEY CENTER. AND OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH THE FORMER STAFF MEMBER IN THIS ROLE WE LEARNED THAT THE SPECIALIST HAS THE ABILITY TO EIGHT SOCIAL WORKERS IN DESIGNING SAFETY PLANS. AND ASSIGN RELEVANT AND HELPFUL SERVICES. MASSACHUSETTS HAS A SIMILAR MODEL IN THEIR DEPARTMENT OF CHILDREN AND FAMILIES. IN MASSACHUSETTS THE UNIT IS COMPRISED OF A NUMBER OF SOCIAL WORKERS ALL THERE TO SUPPORT AND ADDRESS DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CASES. WITH RESPECT TO THE COURTS OUR SECOND RECOMMENDATION FOR SPECIALIZATION IS TO IMPLEMENT A SPECIALIZED DOMESTIC VIOLENCE TRACK. THIS IS A PRACTICE AND A BRASSICA THERE THEY HAVE IMPLEMENTED ESPECIALLY INDEPENDENT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE DEPENDENCY COURT WITH THE JUDGE SOCIAL WORKERS AND LAWYERS WHO HAVE EXPERIENCE AND EXTENSIVE TRAINING IN DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. IS THERE FOR RECOMMENDED THAT THIS BODY CONSIDER THE SPECIALIZATION NECESSARY WOULD THEN STEAL BOTH WITHIN THE COURTS AND IN CHILD WELFARE AGENCY. AS SENATOR CAFIERO POINTED OUT GUIDANCE FOR THE COURTS IN THIS AREA IS THE CENTRAL. LASTLY IN TERMS OF THE STATUTORY CHANGE AS I MENTIONED WE CONDUCTED A FIFTY STATE SURVEY. LOOKING AT HOW EVERY STATE IN THE NATION IS ADDRESSING THE ISSUE. IN WASHINGTON THAT'S HOW THE NEW STATUTE EXPLICITLY STATES POVERTY HOMELESSNESS OR EXPOSURE TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE DOES NOT CONSTITUTE NEGLIGENT TREATMENT OR MALTREATMENT AND OF ITSELF. ONE INTERVIEWEE FROM WASHINGTON EMPHASIZED THAT DESPITE THE STATUTORY TAX IT CAN BE DIFFICULT FOR SURVIVOR TO UTILIZE THE STATUTORY PROVISION EFFORTS BEING MADE IN THE SPACE THAT WE MAY LIKE TO CONSIDER HERE IN CALIFORNIA. ADDITIONALLY AS MR OKAMOTO OUTLINED EARLIER J. STOCK CAN BE A STRONGER FORCE OF LEGAL PROTECTION FOR FAMILIES EXPERIENCING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. IN NEW YORK THERE IS A GREAT PRESIDENT UNDER THE KNUCKLES IN CASE THAT RECOGNIZES THE HARM THAT REMOVAL EVEN GRACE CAN COST AND REQUIRES A COURT TO BALANCE THE HARM OF REMOVAL BUT THE HEART OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IN THEIR DECISION MAKING. IS THERE FOR RECOMMENDED THAT THIS BODY CONSIDER LEGISLATIVE CHANGES NECESSARY TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE WITH BOTH THE CHILD WELFARE AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE COMMUNITIES IDEAS AND INSIGHTS IN MIND. WITH THAT I'M PLEASED TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS THAT MAY BE HELPFUL TO THIS BODY THANK YOU. THANK YOU WROTE REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY ON THAT AND SORRY THAT WE HAD TO RUSH YOU BACK TO A LOT OF IMPORTANT TO OUR RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WERE OFFERED A JOB SO I APPRECIATE THAT AND- PLEASE ENSURE THAT WE HAVE YOUR POWER POINT PRESENTATION SO WE CAN SHARE WITH ALL. MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE- AND SO- I WANT TO THANK EVERY SINGLE PANELIST THAT THAT SPOKE HERE TODAY AND I DO WANT TO GIVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO- THOSE ARE REMOTE A- PEOPLE CALLING IN TO TESTIFY. SO I WOULD LIKE TO CHECK IN. WITH SENATOR SKINNER IF THERE IS ANY LAST QUESTIONS ARE COMMON FOR A PANELIST BEFORE WE MOVE ON. TO- THOSE CALLING IN. I'M JUST APPRECIATE- THE- COMMENTS BY MR ITALY AND- GLAD THAT WE ARE GOING TO GET THAT IN WRITING. AND THEN I THINK I WILL REFRAIN FROM I COULD SAY MORE BUT WE HAVE PUBLIC COMMENT AND I WILL HAVE TO LEAVE VERY SOON. THANK YOU FOR THAT- SO AGAIN THANK YOU TO ALL THE PANELISTS AND WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO ANYONE WANTING TO PROVIDE PUBLIC COMMENTS. DUE TO CONSTRAINTS REGARDING THE LENGTH OF HEARINGS TECHNOLOGY CONSIDERATIONS IN CLEANING PROTOCOLS COMMITTEE CHAIR MAY INSTITUTE LIMITS ON TESTIMONY AND I WILL DECIDE THAT IF ONCE WE KNOW HOW MANY CALLERS WE HAVE TO GO TO ROME FORTY TWO OR THREE IF THERE IS ANY WITNESSES. C. NINE WE WILL NOW GO TO TWENTY FORTY ANYONE WISHING TO SPEAK. C. NINE I THANK YOU WE WILL NOW BE A HEARING FOR PUBLIC COMMENT VIA TELECONFERENCE SERVICE OPERATOR CAN YOU SHARE HOW MANY COLORS WE HAVE. AT THIS TIME WE DO NOT HAVE ANY PUBLIC COMMENT. THANK YOU FOR THAT- SO I WILL LET THEM SENATOR SKINNER WRAP UP CLOSING COMMENTS BEFORE WE CLOSE THE COMMITTEE SENATOR SKINNER- THANK YOU TO REVIEW- SO THERE IS A OT OF RECOMMENDATIONS MADE AND WE ARE A BIG STATE. AND THE JUST THE- TAKE LA COUNTY IS HAS BEEN ALREADY INTO SOME OF THE DATA PRESENTED ALREADY THAT WE HAVE. THE LARGEST NUMBER OF CHILDREN IN FOSTER. ANY OF ANYWHERE IN THE WHOLE U. S. AND A GOOD PERCENT OF THOSE KIDS WERE- SUBJECT TO- WE'RE IN HOUSEHOLDS WITH DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. AND WE- WE KNOW THAT IN THAT THAT'S THE CASE AND- YOU KNOW MANY OF MOST OTHER EVERYWHERE ELSE IN THE STATE. SO THE QUESTION OF HOW WE IN IN CALIFORNIA IS VERY ORIENTED. TOWARDS COUNTY- COUNTY SPECIFIC PROGRAMS IN ALL THESE AREAS OUR IT'S OUR COUNTY OUR SOCIAL WORKERS ARE COUNTY WORKERS OUR COURTS ARE IN EFFECT COUNTY COURTS AND EVEN THOUGH WE SET STATEWIDE POLICY IT'S VERY MUCH UP TO THE COUNTIES TO DELIVER AND SO FOR EXAMPLE IT IS COMPLETELY AVAILABLE TO ANY COUNTY TO SET UP THE TYPE OF PROGRAM LIKE IN NEBRASKA WHERE THEY HAVE A DEPENDENCY COURT% WHERE THEY UTILIZED THE SOCIAL WORKERS AND- THE- CHART YOU KNOW INTEGRATE ALL ALL OF THE- SYSTEMS AND MAKE A VERY FOCUSED ON DEMAND. DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IT IS AVAILABLE NOT ALL OF OUR COUNTIES TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT WHETHER WE HAVE TO PROVIDE SOME MORE INCENTIVE OR I THINK THOSE ARE ALL THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO CONSIDER AND- AND OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE INCREASE THE AVAILABILITY OF TRAUMA INFORMED CARE. FOR BOTH PERPETRATORS AND- AND VICTIMS BUT OF COURSE ESPECIALLY THE VICTIMS AND THEIR CHILDREN TO MAKE SURE THAT THE VICTIMS AND THE CHILDREN ARE NOT PUNISHED FOR BEING IN THIS CIRCUMSTANCE BUT I THINK THOSE ARE VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE- D. D. CARCERAL ASPECT ALONE WILL NOT SOLVE THIS SO I REALLY I REALLY APPRECIATE ALL THE TESTIMONY AND I REALLY LOOK FORWARD TO IT TOO LOOKING AT. THE RECOMMENDATIONS IN DETAIL WITH MY STAFF AND THEN COLLABORATING WITH THEIR ARCHER I KNOW HOW- WE'VE WORKED SO WELL WHEN IT COMES TO THIS ISSUE SO I GOT WHAT I WANTED TO SAY THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE AND I'LL CONTINUE TO- TO WORK WITH YOU I KNOW WE HEARD SO MANY RECOMMENDATIONS WHEN. A LOT OF I. OPENING CASES THAT WERE SHARED- AND I THINK THAT- THE OVER ARCHING I WOULD SEE THEME IS EDUCATION AND IMPLEMENTATION AND MAKING SURE THAT EVERYONE'S ON THE SAME PAGE- AS SENATOR SKINNER SURE THERE'S A LOT OF. THINGS THAT COUNTIES COULD ALREADY DO IT'S JUST FIGURING OUT WHAT WE CAN DO TO SUPPORT THEM TO ENSURE THAT THESE PROGRAMS. OR EDUCATION HAPPENS BUT I DO WANT TO POINT OUT TWO THINGS- I KNOW ONE OF THE- PRESENTERS- DISCUSSED. MAYBE SEPARATING THE VICTIM WITH THE PERPETRATOR OR COMING AT DIFFERENT TIMES OUT SO BUT I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT A BILL THAT I PASS THIS LAST YEAR SB FIVE THIRTY EIGHT WHICH WILL ALLOW VICTIMS NOW TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY REMOTELY- YOU KNOW FOURTEEN THE COURT NEEDED SOME TIME TO IMPLEMENT AND SO IT WILL BECOME. A LAW TWEET TWENTY THREE YES TWENTY TWENTY THREE AND SO THAT WILL HELP WITH- THE INTIMIDATION AND OTHER ITEMS RECOUNTING THEIR STORIES FOR FEAR OF BEING A FUN OTHER ABUSE YOURSELFHOPEFULLY IT'S ONE STEP CLOSER TO. TO MAKING SURE THAT VICTIMS FEEL CONFIDENT AND COMFORTABLE- YOU KNOW SPEAKING THEIR TRUTH AND TELLING THEIR STORIES- WE ALSO HEARD SOME CHALLENGES WITH- I'M ON MY BILL SB ELEVEN FORTY ONE WHICH ADDRESSES COURSE OF CONTROL A LOT MORE WORK TO BE DONE IN THAT SPACE AND- AND AGAIN IT'S UNDERSTANDING- BY THE COURTS AND A PUBLIC SAFETY AND OTHERS UNDERSTANDING WHAT IT IS AND HOW WE CAN HELP ENFORCE IT AND- WHETHER WE HAVE TO PROVIDE SERVICES. OR FIND DEAN OR ANYTHING TO HELP MAKE SURE THAT- THAT IT'S BEING UTILIZED CORRECTLY- BUT LASTLY I WILL FINISH WITH THIS YOU KNOW WE HAD SOME GREAT TESTIMONY FROM ALL PANELISTS IN WHAT I. TOOK AWAY FROM IT IS YOU KNOW- DO HAVE SO MANY LAWS THAT FOLK ON PROTECT VICTIM BUT I- YOU KNOW ALSO- REALLY ENCOURAGED BY WHAT I HEARD BY ONE OF THE PANELISTS AND I GUESS IT'S TRYING TO BRING THAT BALANCE BETWEEN. LEAVING A CHILD IN A VICTIM IN A HOME WHERE THERE IS ABUSE. OB BUT THAT BALANCE OF WHAT MR. OKAMOTO SHARED AND THAT HE IS SOMETIMES THERE IS THAT THIS OVER REACTION THAT AUTOMATICALLY BREAKS UP FAMILIES- WHEN SOMETHING CAN BE DONE IN TERMS OF PROVIDING SERVICES AND COUNSELING IN KEEPING THE FAMILY UNIT TOGETHER WHICH MAY BE. WHAT'S BEST FOR THAT FAMILY CELL AGAIN TRYING TO BRING THAT BALANCE. I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH SENATOR SKINNER CENTER GOT A GENERAL AND ALL OF MY OTHER COLLEAGUES WHETHER IT'S THE ASSEMBLY AND THE SENATE TO ENSURE THAT WE CONTINUE TO PUSH ON THESE ISSUES. AGAIN I WANT TO THANK ALL THE PANELISTS HERE- TESTIMONY IS VALUABLE AND WE APPRECIATE THE TIME YOU TAKE TO BE HERE AND ANYONE LISTENING AT HOME THANK YOU FOR. FOR LISTENING- BUT IT WILL MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE ALL THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS AND THAT ALL OUR MEMBERS HERE HALF OF THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS AND WE WILL. CONVENE IN A FUTURE UPDATE SO WE CAN EXPLORE HOW WE MOVE FORWARD WITH THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS. THANK YOU EVERYONE AND THE COMMITTEE IS NOW. IN RECESS THANK YOU. THANKS EVERYBODY TAYLOR YOU WERE AWESOME I WANT TO MEET YOU I MEAN LA. OKAY GREAT I'D LOVE TO HEAR THANK YOU SO MUCH. WE CONNECT VIA EMAIL I.
