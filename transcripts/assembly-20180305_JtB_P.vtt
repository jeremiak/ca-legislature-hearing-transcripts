OF THE BENEFITS IT HAS GAINED BY

THIS MODEL OF OPERATION.

00:14:32.371 --> 00:14:36.275 region:rollup2
C. TECH HAS A PROGRAM THAT WORKS

00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:37.343 region:rollup2
VERY WELL AND SEE TECH BELIEVES

00:14:36.275 --> 00:14:39.145 region:rollup2
THAT IT SHOULD CONTINUE IN ITS

TECH DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT ANY

00:14:49.789 --> 00:14:52.492 region:rollup2
IN RELATION TO ISSUE NUMBER FOUR

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:57.830 region:rollup2
IT WAS NEVER THE INTENT OF THE

ITS LAWS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN

00:15:00.566 --> 00:15:04.237 region:rollup2

00:15:08.875 --> 00:15:11.944 region:rollup2
THIS INTENT CAN CLEARLY BE SEEN

00:15:10.643 --> 00:15:13.012 region:rollup2
BY THE FACT THAT SEE TECH DID

00:15:11.944 --> 00:15:13.513 region:rollup2

AROUND THIS TIME SEE TEXT SAW

WITH C. TECH AS TAX PREPARERS.

00:15:44.744 --> 00:15:49.215 region:rollup2

DENY THE REGISTRATION OR REVOKE

00:15:49.215 --> 00:15:53.119 region:rollup2
THEIR C. TECH REGISTRATION.

00:15:51.117 --> 00:15:54.887 region:rollup2
THIS LOOPHOLE HAS BEEN CLOSED

00:15:53.119 --> 00:15:56.389 region:rollup2
SINCE TWENTY FOURTEEN.

00:15:54.887 --> 00:15:58.224 region:rollup2
WELL SEE TECH HAS ONLY TAKEN

00:15:56.389 --> 00:15:59.692 region:rollup2
DISCIPLINARY ACTION AGAINST A

00:15:58.224 --> 00:16:01.394 region:rollup2
HANDFUL OF INDIVIDUALS.

00:15:59.692 --> 00:16:03.596 region:rollup2
THOSE CASES HAVE ALL STEM FROM

00:16:01.394 --> 00:16:04.931 region:rollup2
SITUATIONS WHERE THE BOARD OF

00:16:03.596 --> 00:16:05.364 region:rollup2

INDIVIDUALS.

00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:12.038 region:rollup2
C. TAC IS NOT AT ITS HEART AN

ENFORCEMENT AGENCY.

00:16:12.038 --> 00:16:15.942 region:rollup2

FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR BOND.

00:16:22.782 --> 00:16:25.918 region:rollup2
C. TECH DOES NOT CURRENTLY

00:16:24.050 --> 00:16:28.054 region:rollup2
REQUIRE REGISTRANTS TO SUBMIT TO

THE DOJ OR FBI.

00:16:31.591 --> 00:16:35.628 region:rollup2
INSTEAD SEE TECH RECEIVED

00:16:33.125 --> 00:16:37.663 region:rollup2
INFORMATION FROM THE IRS THE

00:16:35.628 --> 00:16:39.365 region:rollup2

FOR TAX ADMINISTRATION IN THE

00:16:42.969 --> 00:16:45.872 region:rollup2
PAST.

00:16:44.370 --> 00:16:47.073 region:rollup2
C. TAC DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT

00:16:45.872 --> 00:16:48.975 region:rollup2
THERE WOULD BE A SIGNIFICANT

00:16:47.073 --> 00:16:50.243 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT BENEFIT. IF

00:16:48.975 --> 00:16:51.911 region:rollup2
APPLICANTS AND REGISTRANTS

00:16:50.243 --> 00:16:53.346 region:rollup2
REQUIRED TO SUBMIT TO A CRIMINAL

REGISTRATION. AND ANY SUCH

00:16:56.549 --> 00:16:58.951 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENT WOULD BE QUICK WOULD

00:16:57.216 --> 00:17:00.987 region:rollup2
CREATE OVERWHELMING

00:16:58.951 --> 00:17:02.488 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATIVE BURDENS. THAT

00:17:00.987 --> 00:17:04.790 region:rollup2
WOULD RESULT IN INCREASED CROP

00:17:02.488 --> 00:17:06.993 region:rollup2
COSTS AND A LOSS OF PROCESSING

00:17:04.790 --> 00:17:08.561 region:rollup2
EFFICIENCIES.

00:17:06.993 --> 00:17:10.263 region:rollup2
IF SEATAC WERE TO SUDDENLY

00:17:08.561 --> 00:17:12.698 region:rollup2
REQUIRE AND RECEIVE CRIMINAL

00:17:10.263 --> 00:17:14.133 region:rollup2
BACKGROUND PORTS REPORTS. IT

00:17:12.698 --> 00:17:16.102 region:rollup2
WOULD HAVE TO HIRE ATTORNEYS TO

00:17:14.133 --> 00:17:17.103 region:rollup2
REVIEW THESE REPORTS. AND

00:17:16.102 --> 00:17:19.071 region:rollup2
INTERPRET THEM FOR ALL

00:17:17.103 --> 00:17:20.673 region:rollup2
APPROXIMATELY FORTY THOUSAND

00:17:19.071 --> 00:17:21.941 region:rollup2
REGISTRANTS.

00:17:20.673 --> 00:17:23.509 region:rollup2
THIS WOULD TAKE A SIGNIFICANT

00:17:21.941 --> 00:17:26.178 region:rollup2
AMOUNT OF TIME AND RESULT IN A

00:17:23.509 --> 00:17:27.980 region:rollup2
GREATLY INCREASED EXPENSE.

00:17:26.178 --> 00:17:29.415 region:rollup2
THEN THERE WOULD BE AN ONGOING

00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:31.951 region:rollup2
NEED FOR ATTORNEYS TO INTERPRET

00:17:29.415 --> 00:17:33.920 region:rollup2
SUBSEQUENT ARREST NOTIFICATIONS.

00:17:31.951 --> 00:17:36.222 region:rollup2
AS THEY ARE RECEIVED AND TO

00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:38.257 region:rollup2
REVIEW DOJ AND FBI REPORTS FOR

00:17:36.222 --> 00:17:39.825 region:rollup2
NEW REGISTRANTS.

00:17:38.257 --> 00:17:41.327 region:rollup2
APPLICANTS AND REGISTRADA BE

00:17:39.825 --> 00:17:44.096 region:rollup2
REQUIRED TO PAY FEES FOR LIFE

00:17:41.327 --> 00:17:46.399 region:rollup2
SCANS WHICH RANGE FROM FIFTY TO

00:17:44.096 --> 00:17:47.934 region:rollup2
SEVENTY FIVE DOLLARS A PERSON.

00:17:46.399 --> 00:17:50.269 region:rollup2
C. TAC WOULD HAVE TO IMPLEMENT A

00:17:47.934 --> 00:17:51.671 region:rollup2
NEW PROCESS AND PROCEDURE FOR

00:17:50.269 --> 00:17:54.040 region:rollup2
SENDING NO LONGER INTERESTED

00:17:51.671 --> 00:17:56.075 region:rollup2
NOTIFICATIONS TO THE DOJ. IN

00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:57.443 region:rollup2
SITUATIONS WHERE PEOPLE WERE NO

00:17:56.075 --> 00:17:58.778 region:rollup2
LONGER REGISTERED.

00:17:57.443 --> 00:18:00.279 region:rollup2
IT WOULD HAVE TO CHANGE ITS

00:17:58.778 --> 00:18:02.915 region:rollup2
CURRENT COMPUTER SYSTEM AND

00:18:00.279 --> 00:18:04.050 region:rollup2
APPLICATION PROCESSING SYSTEM.

00:18:02.915 --> 00:18:05.217 region:rollup2
SO THAT THESE CRIMINAL HISTORY

00:18:04.050 --> 00:18:06.919 region:rollup2
REPORTS COULD BE REVIEWED AND

00:18:05.217 --> 00:18:08.921 region:rollup2
APPROVED BEFORE REGISTRATION

00:18:06.919 --> 00:18:11.691 region:rollup2
WOULD BE ISSUED. INSTEAD OF THE

00:18:08.921 --> 00:18:12.792 region:rollup2
CURRENT PROCESS OF IMMEDIATELY

00:18:11.691 --> 00:18:15.428 region:rollup2
ISSUING REGISTRATIONS.

00:18:12.792 --> 00:18:16.896 region:rollup2
THE COST IN BOTH TIME AND MONEY.

00:18:15.428 --> 00:18:18.965 region:rollup2
TO IMPLEMENT ALL OF THESE

00:18:16.896 --> 00:18:20.700 region:rollup2
CHANGES WOULD BE STAGGERING.

00:18:18.965 --> 00:18:23.135 region:rollup2
SEE TAX CURRENT SYSTEM WORKS

00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:24.003 region:rollup2
WELL. WITH OTHERS AND GENERALLY

00:18:26.739 --> 00:18:30.209 region:rollup2
THE VAST MAJORITY OF COMPLAINTS

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:31.944 region:rollup2
DETECTS RECEIVES ARE FOR

00:18:30.209 --> 00:18:33.412 region:rollup2
UNREGISTERED ACTIVITY.

00:18:31.944 --> 00:18:35.614 region:rollup2
THESE COMPLAINTS ARE REFERRED TO

00:18:33.412 --> 00:18:37.149 region:rollup2
FTP WHO DETERMINES AT ITS OWN

ACTION.

00:18:40.586 --> 00:18:45.558 region:rollup2
C. TAXIS SEES NO NEED TO CHANGE

00:18:43.289 --> 00:18:46.859 region:rollup2
ITS HISTORIC ROLE IN ORDER TO

00:18:45.558 --> 00:18:50.196 region:rollup2
MAKE IT INTO SOMETHING IT WAS

00:18:46.859 --> 00:18:53.332 region:rollup2
NEVER INTENDED TO BE. AT GREAT

00:18:50.196 --> 00:18:54.834 region:rollup2
COST TO THE REGISTRANTS.

00:18:53.332 --> 00:18:56.636 region:rollup2
THE CURRENT SYSTEM WORKS WELL.

00:18:54.834 --> 00:18:58.471 region:rollup2
AND SEATAC DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT

00:18:56.636 --> 00:19:00.339 region:rollup2
ANY LEGISLATIVE CHANGES NEED TO

00:18:58.471 --> 00:19:01.741 region:rollup2
BE MADE IN THIS REGARD. BUT IS

SUCCESSFUL MEMORIES ARE FIGHTING

00:23:33.879 --> 00:23:37.716 region:rollup2

ALSO CORRECT IN THE PINES THEIR

00:23:37.716 --> 00:23:42.688 region:rollup2

CREATED OF TWENTY YEARS AGO.

00:23:47.192 --> 00:23:51.163 region:rollup2
BASED ON CERTAIN CONDITIONS

00:23:49.395 --> 00:23:52.998 region:rollup2
CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS AND NEEDS

00:23:51.163 --> 00:23:54.099 region:rollup2
BASICALLY OF TRYING TO REGULATE

00:23:52.998 --> 00:23:56.335 region:rollup2
AND A SENSE OF.

00:23:54.099 --> 00:23:58.570 region:rollup2
ADMINISTERING THE THE THE

00:23:56.335 --> 00:24:00.339 region:rollup2
LICENSING AND REGISTRATION OF OF

THESE THE PARTICIPANTS. HAVE YOU

00:24:00.339 --> 00:24:03.342 region:rollup2
SEEN ANYTHING OVER THE TWENTY

00:24:02.841 --> 00:24:05.244 region:rollup2
YEARS THAT HAS CHANGED.

00:24:03.342 --> 00:24:07.446 region:rollup2
IN.

00:24:05.244 --> 00:24:10.015 region:rollup2
THE INDUSTRY THAT WOULD REQUIRE

00:24:07.446 --> 00:24:12.952 region:rollup2
YOU TO CHANGE IN HOW YOU DO

00:24:10.015 --> 00:24:15.888 region:rollup2
BUSINESS OR HOW YOUR STRUCTURED.

00:24:12.952 --> 00:24:19.091 region:rollup2
AND THE. TWENTY.

00:24:15.888 --> 00:24:21.694 region:rollup2
OH EIGHT OF THE IRS DECIDED THAT

00:24:19.091 --> 00:24:23.329 region:rollup2
THEY. LIKED OUR PROGRAM SO MUCH

00:24:21.694 --> 00:24:26.565 region:rollup2
THAT THEY WANTED TO DO SOMETHING

00:24:23.329 --> 00:24:27.933 region:rollup2
NATIONALLY. AND THEY PROCEEDED

00:24:26.565 --> 00:24:31.236 region:rollup2
TO.

00:24:27.933 --> 00:24:33.138 region:rollup2
OFF WANT REQUIRE PETER NUMBERS

00:24:31.236 --> 00:24:35.140 region:rollup2
THEY WANTED TO REQUIRE AND THESE

00:24:33.138 --> 00:24:39.111 region:rollup2
WERE FOR THE NON EXEMPT

00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:40.646 region:rollup2
PREPARERS. AND THEY ALSO WANTED

00:24:39.111 --> 00:24:43.015 region:rollup2
A STANDARDIZED TEST FOR THESE

00:24:40.646 --> 00:24:45.484 region:rollup2
NON EXEMPT PREPARERS AS WELL AS

00:24:43.015 --> 00:24:46.018 region:rollup2
EDUCATION REQUIRED EDUCATION.

00:24:45.484 --> 00:24:48.654 region:rollup2
AND I THINK AT THAT POINT

00:24:46.018 --> 00:24:51.824 region:rollup2
SEATAC.

00:24:48.654 --> 00:24:54.159 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE IRS DECIDED THAT

00:24:51.824 --> 00:24:56.628 region:rollup2
SINCE WE WERE REVIEWING THE

00:24:54.159 --> 00:24:58.197 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS AND APPROVING THEM.

00:24:56.628 --> 00:24:59.998 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:24:58.197 --> 00:25:01.533 region:rollup2
THEY WERE THEN GOING TO IF THEY

00:24:59.998 --> 00:25:03.135 region:rollup2
GOT A LETTER FROM US SAYING THAT

00:25:01.533 --> 00:25:04.937 region:rollup2
THIS PERSON THIS PARTICULAR

00:25:03.135 --> 00:25:07.339 region:rollup2
SCHOOL IS APPROVED. THEY WOULD

00:25:04.937 --> 00:25:08.240 region:rollup2
AUTOMATICALLY APPROVE IT AS WELL

00:25:07.339 --> 00:25:10.642 region:rollup2
SO.

00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:11.343 region:rollup2
AT THAT POINT SEE TECH DECIDED

00:25:10.642 --> 00:25:15.614 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:25:11.343 --> 00:25:17.583 region:rollup2
WE REALLY. NEEDED TO LOOK

00:25:15.614 --> 00:25:20.719 region:rollup2
CLOSER AT THE SCHOOLS WE WERE

00:25:17.583 --> 00:25:23.255 region:rollup2
APPROVING AND TO REALLY. MAKE A

00:25:20.719 --> 00:25:26.125 region:rollup2
CONCERTED EFFORT THAT ALL THE

00:25:23.255 --> 00:25:27.059 region:rollup2
COURSES WE WERE LOOKING AT WERE.

00:25:26.125 --> 00:25:29.928 region:rollup2
YOU.

00:25:27.059 --> 00:25:32.331 region:rollup2
REALLY A VERY GOOD COURSES AND

00:25:29.928 --> 00:25:33.699 region:rollup2
WE DEVELOPED A WHOLE NEW POLICY

00:25:32.331 --> 00:25:34.867 region:rollup2
FOR THE SCHOOLS THAT WE WERE

00:25:33.699 --> 00:25:37.703 region:rollup2
PROVING.

00:25:34.867 --> 00:25:39.505 region:rollup2
ARE THE CURRICULA OF THE TESTS

00:25:37.703 --> 00:25:41.707 region:rollup2
THAT WERE BEING GIVEN BY OUR

THAT BEING SAID ARE THERE THE

00:26:34.726 --> 00:26:39.164 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT STAFFERS

00:26:36.662 --> 00:26:45.804 region:rollup2
ARE RECOMMENDING DO YOU THINK

00:26:39.164 --> 00:26:48.407 region:rollup2

YES I WE. WOULD DO THAT REALLY

00:26:54.079 --> 00:26:58.350 region:rollup2
DRESS THAT SAYS YEAH. IT WOULD

00:26:55.681 --> 00:26:59.985 region:rollup2
BE VERY DIFFICULT FOR US TO

00:26:58.350 --> 00:27:02.654 region:rollup2
ARMED TO THE ENFORCEMENT

00:26:59.985 --> 00:27:03.689 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS THAT.

00:27:02.654 --> 00:27:06.758 region:rollup2
ARE.

OUTLINED IN THOSE ISSUES ARM IT

00:27:06.758 --> 00:27:10.729 region:rollup2
WOULD IT WOULD BE EXTREMELY

DIFFICULT FOR US AN AS ALISON

00:27:10.729 --> 00:27:14.633 region:rollup2
POINTED OUT THE COSTS WOULD BE

00:27:12.764 --> 00:27:15.334 region:rollup2
EXCEEDING TOOK MANY OF THE

00:27:14.633 --> 00:27:17.803 region:rollup2
PEOPLE YOU KNOW WE HAVE BEEN

THIRTY THREE DOLLARS WE TRY TO

00:27:22.875 --> 00:27:26.011 region:rollup2
KEEP IT LOW AND I THINK THAT

00:27:24.877 --> 00:27:27.546 region:rollup2

STIR PREPARING OUR RETURNS SO I

SUCH A BURDEN ON C. TECH THAT IT

00:27:44.563 --> 00:27:47.366 region:rollup2

THIS SECTION TO SET UP THAT

00:50:04.501 --> 00:50:07.972 region:rollup2

DETERMINE. WHICH.

01:39:04.238 --> 01:39:07.642 region:rollup2
IT PLATFORM IN FACT IN FACT WILL

01:39:06.541 --> 01:39:10.077 region:rollup2
BE UTILIZED.

BY BY PROFESSIONAL FISHER'S

01:39:10.077 --> 01:39:13.047 region:rollup2
BUREAU YET TO BE DETERMINED

WHETHER OR NOT THAT IN FACT WILL

01:39:13.047 --> 01:39:16.350 region:rollup2
BE PRES.

01:39:13.948 --> 01:39:18.920 region:rollup2
SHE MENTIONED SPECIFICALLY

01:39:16.350 --> 01:39:19.454 region:rollup2
ABOUT RELEASED THREE PROGRAMS

01:39:18.920 --> 01:39:20.087 region:rollup2
ARE THAT WE'RE IN RELEASED

01:39:19.454 --> 01:39:22.990 region:rollup2
THREE.

01:39:20.087 --> 01:39:23.257 region:rollup2
THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY I

01:39:22.990 --> 01:39:28.296 region:rollup2
BELIEVE.

01:39:23.257 --> 01:39:30.198 region:rollup2
SIXTEEN PROGRAMS THAT. ARE

01:39:28.296 --> 01:39:31.833 region:rollup2
STILL GOING TO EMBARK UPON. I'M

01:39:30.198 --> 01:39:33.601 region:rollup2
THE BUSINESS MODERNIZATION PLAN

01:39:31.833 --> 01:39:35.036 region:rollup2
SO IT IS IT'S VERY POINT I

01:39:33.601 --> 01:39:36.838 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THAT.

01:39:35.036 --> 01:39:40.141 region:rollup2
RELEASE ONE AND RELEASED TO.

01:39:36.838 --> 01:39:42.243 region:rollup2
MANY OF THOSE PROGRAMS DID IN

FACT SELECT BREEZE ARE ONE

01:39:42.243 --> 01:39:46.280 region:rollup2
PROGRAM. THAT YOU ALL MAY BE

OF CANADA CANNABIS CONTROL OF IN

01:39:48.049 --> 01:39:55.223 region:rollup2
PART. BY LEARNING.

01:39:51.352 --> 01:39:56.357 region:rollup2
OR HEARD. VIA THE THE LESSONS

01:39:55.223 --> 01:39:59.160 region:rollup2
LEARNED AT HE DEPARTMENT

01:39:56.357 --> 01:39:59.994 region:rollup2
UNDERTOOK IN RELEASE ONE.

01:39:59.160 --> 01:40:01.229 region:rollup2
THE BUREAU OF CATS CAN CONTROL

01:39:59.994 --> 01:40:01.729 region:rollup2
DID NOT SELECT BREEZE AND SO

01:40:01.229 --> 01:40:03.564 region:rollup2
AGAIN MY POINT IS THAT.

01:40:01.729 --> 01:40:04.832 region:rollup2
RATHER THAN.

01:40:03.564 --> 01:40:06.767 region:rollup2
COMPELLING EACH REMAINING

01:40:04.832 --> 01:40:08.436 region:rollup2
PROGRAM AT LEAST THREE TO GO

01:40:06.767 --> 01:40:10.671 region:rollup2
THROUGH TO GO THROUGH ARE TO

01:40:08.436 --> 01:40:13.241 region:rollup2
SELECT BREEZE. THE PROCESS WILL

01:40:10.671 --> 01:40:14.775 region:rollup2
DETERMINE THAT MANY FACTORS WILL

01:40:13.241 --> 01:40:16.844 region:rollup2
BE CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING.

01:40:14.775 --> 01:40:19.714 region:rollup2
WHICH IT PLATFORM WILL IN FACT

01:40:16.844 --> 01:40:23.851 region:rollup2
BE SELECTED FOR THE REMAINING

01:40:19.714 --> 01:40:25.953 region:rollup2
RELEASED THREE PROGRAMS.

01:40:23.851 --> 01:40:28.022 region:rollup2
YET IT MAYBE THIS JUST DESERVES

01:40:25.953 --> 01:40:30.491 region:rollup2
THAT A MORE BROAD DISCUSSION

01:40:28.022 --> 01:40:31.692 region:rollup2
ABOUT BREEZY OUT IN IT IN IN

01:40:30.491 --> 01:40:33.995 region:rollup2
GENERAL AND I CERTAINLY

01:40:31.692 --> 01:40:36.564 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND IF IF. IF IT DOESN'T

01:40:33.995 --> 01:40:38.666 region:rollup2
MEET THE NEEDS. OF THE BUREAUS.

01:40:36.564 --> 01:40:40.268 region:rollup2
.

01:40:38.666 --> 01:40:41.903 region:rollup2
YEAH YOU DON'T WANT TO FORCE A

01:40:40.268 --> 01:40:43.237 region:rollup2
SQUARE PEG IN A YOU KNOW IN A IN

01:40:41.903 --> 01:40:45.139 region:rollup2
A ROUND HOLE I GET THAT BUT I

01:40:43.237 --> 01:40:46.674 region:rollup2
ALSO GET THE FACT THERE'S ONE

01:40:45.139 --> 01:40:49.076 region:rollup2
HELL OF A LOT OF COSTS

01:40:46.674 --> 01:40:50.478 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATED WITH THIS AND.

01:40:49.076 --> 01:40:54.148 region:rollup2
I THINK WE JUST NEEDTO MAKE

01:40:50.478 --> 01:40:55.416 region:rollup2
DARN SURE THAT IT YET. IT.

01:40:54.148 --> 01:40:57.018 region:rollup2
BUT THERE IS SOME OVERSIGHT

01:40:55.416 --> 01:40:59.253 region:rollup2
THERE TO MAKE SURE THAT IF IT IF

01:40:57.018 --> 01:41:00.855 region:rollup2
IT IS A POSSIBILITY OF IT BEING

01:40:59.253 --> 01:41:02.957 region:rollup2
USED EFFECTIVELY THAT WE GO THAT

01:41:00.855 --> 01:41:04.392 region:rollup2
ROUTE. I PLAYED EVERY SENATOR

01:41:02.957 --> 01:41:07.395 region:rollup2
AND BY DESIGN.

01:41:04.392 --> 01:41:09.730 region:rollup2
THAT IS THE APPROACH FOR THESE

01:41:07.395 --> 01:41:12.066 region:rollup2
RELEASED THREE. PROGRAMS AGAIN

01:41:09.730 --> 01:41:13.467 region:rollup2

01:41:29.884 --> 01:41:34.021 region:rollup2
POPULATION AND IT'S MUCH SLOWER

01:41:31.953 --> 01:41:35.556 region:rollup2
THAN THE ESTIMATE. OR THE GROWTH

01:41:34.021 --> 01:41:37.058 region:rollup2
ESTIMATE GIVEN AND DIED BACK

01:41:35.556 --> 01:41:39.527 region:rollup2
INTO THE SERVICE ONLY TO THE

01:41:37.058 --> 01:41:40.461 region:rollup2
STATE SO BIG. AND THE WORLD IS

01:41:39.527 --> 01:41:42.196 region:rollup2
SO COMPLICATED WHAT WHAT

01:41:40.461 --> 01:41:44.632 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTS OTHER THAN THE EIGHTY

01:41:42.196 --> 01:41:47.168 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF COST OF A LICENSE TO

01:41:44.632 --> 01:41:48.936 region:rollup2
THE DEAD THAT DELTA BETWEEN. THE

01:41:47.168 --> 01:41:50.805 region:rollup2
HOURS OF WHAT WAS ESTIMATED A

01:41:48.936 --> 01:41:52.873 region:rollup2
FORECAST AND HOW SMALL IT DOES

01:41:50.805 --> 01:41:54.408 region:rollup2
SEEM. LIKE IN A PROFESSION FOR

01:41:52.873 --> 01:41:54.942 region:rollup2
TEACHERS TO PROVIDE A SERVICE

01:41:54.408 --> 01:41:57.611 region:rollup2
THAT IS NECESSARY SO IS IS

01:41:54.942 --> 01:41:58.779 region:rollup2
THERE.

01:41:57.611 --> 01:42:02.950 region:rollup2
A PROBLEM WITH UNLICENSED

01:41:58.779 --> 01:42:03.317 region:rollup2
ACTIVITY. AND IF SO WHAT SHOULD

01:42:02.950 --> 01:42:04.986 region:rollup2
WE DO ABOUT IT.

01:42:03.317 --> 01:42:08.356 region:rollup2
AND.

01:42:04.986 --> 01:42:11.325 region:rollup2
AT SO AS IN RESPONSE TO HAVING A

01:42:08.356 --> 01:42:14.061 region:rollup2
SMALLER ZERO AS I UNDERSTAND

01:42:11.325 --> 01:42:15.863 region:rollup2
WHEN THE BUREAU WAS FORMED THE

01:42:14.061 --> 01:42:17.131 region:rollup2
ESTIMATES FOR THE NUMBER OF

01:42:15.863 --> 01:42:19.967 region:rollup2
LICENSEES IS BASED OFF OF THE

01:42:17.131 --> 01:42:21.435 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE HAD A.

01:42:19.967 --> 01:42:22.970 region:rollup2
DISTRIBUTION AND THAT'S WERE

01:42:21.435 --> 01:42:25.272 region:rollup2
PRACTITIONERS AT THE TIME BEFORE

01:42:22.970 --> 01:42:27.375 region:rollup2
THEY WERE REQUIRED TO BE

01:42:25.272 --> 01:42:28.743 region:rollup2
LICENSED AND.

01:42:27.375 --> 01:42:29.510 region:rollup2
WORD THAT SITE AND BELIEVE THAT

01:42:28.743 --> 01:42:30.711 region:rollup2
THAT'S HOW THEY BEAT THE

01:42:29.510 --> 01:42:34.315 region:rollup2
ESTIMATES OF WHAT THOUGH

01:42:30.711 --> 01:42:36.183 region:rollup2
LICENSURE POPULATION WOULD BE.

01:42:34.315 --> 01:42:37.284 region:rollup2
RIGHT BUT IT'S GETS CLEARLY IT'S

01:42:36.183 --> 01:42:38.819 region:rollup2
NOT GROWING PROPORTION TO THE

01:42:37.284 --> 01:42:40.221 region:rollup2
NEW YEAR EVEN THE POPULATION SO

01:42:38.819 --> 01:42:42.023 region:rollup2
WHAT DOES THAT SAY ABOUT THE

01:42:40.221 --> 01:42:44.225 region:rollup2

PERCENT AN ACTIVE LICENSES SO I

01:42:54.835 --> 01:42:58.239 region:rollup2

LIKE I'M CRITICIZING I I THINK

01:43:04.645 --> 01:43:07.982 region:rollup2

INFORMATION WE RECEIVE.

01:56:09.563 --> 01:56:12.732 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY THE DEPARTMENT DOES

01:56:11.231 --> 01:56:14.601 region:rollup2
NOT HAVE PERFORMANCE MEASURES

01:56:12.732 --> 01:56:17.270 region:rollup2
FORTS REVIEW PROCESS BUT THIS IS

01:56:14.601 --> 01:56:18.805 region:rollup2
ONE OF OUR STRATEGIC PLAN GOALS.

01:56:17.270 --> 01:56:20.173 region:rollup2
AS PART OF PROCESS TO ESTABLISH

01:56:21.908 --> 01:56:24.778 region:rollup2
THE DEPARTMENT. IS SPEARHEADING

01:56:24.244 --> 01:56:26.713 region:rollup2
A NEW REGULATION TRACKING

01:56:24.778 --> 01:56:28.081 region:rollup2
SYSTEM.

01:56:26.713 --> 01:56:30.050 region:rollup2
THAT WILL INTEGRATE EACH OF THE

01:56:28.081 --> 01:56:32.652 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT'S KEY REVIEW AREA IS

01:56:30.050 --> 01:56:33.753 region:rollup2
INTO ONE SYSTEM.

01:56:32.652 --> 01:56:35.722 region:rollup2
THIS WILL ENABLE THE DEPARTMENT

01:56:33.753 --> 01:56:36.957 region:rollup2
AND PROGRAMS TO QUICKLY

01:56:35.722 --> 01:56:38.758 region:rollup2
DETERMINE THE STATUS OF A

01:56:36.957 --> 01:56:40.727 region:rollup2
REGULATION. AND TO DEVELOP BENCH

01:56:38.758 --> 01:56:42.762 region:rollup2
MARKS FOR REVIEW DURING EACH

01:56:40.727 --> 01:56:44.164 region:rollup2
STAGE OF THE REVIEW PROCESS.

01:56:42.762 --> 01:56:45.732 region:rollup2
NOT ONLY WILL IT HOLD UP THE

01:56:44.164 --> 01:56:47.634 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT ACCOUNTABLE FOR IT

01:56:45.732 --> 01:56:48.568 region:rollup2
FOR REVIEW TIME LINES.

01:56:47.634 --> 01:56:49.870 region:rollup2
BUT WILL PROVIDE GREATER

01:56:48.568 --> 01:56:51.371 region:rollup2
TRANSPARENCY TO THE BOARDS AND

01:56:49.870 --> 01:56:54.007 region:rollup2
GROWS AWAITING FEEDBACK FROM THE

01:56:51.371 --> 01:56:55.475 region:rollup2

01:56:54.007 --> 01:56:57.878 region:rollup2

01:57:01.581 --> 01:57:04.684 region:rollup2

TIMELINES AND PERFORMANCE

01:57:04.684 --> 01:57:07.921 region:rollup2
MEASURES SHOULD BE ESTABLISHED.

01:57:06.786 --> 01:57:09.856 region:rollup2
I'M ALSO CONCERNED WITH THE

01:57:07.921 --> 01:57:11.124 region:rollup2
QUALITY OF REGULATIONS.

01:57:09.856 --> 01:57:12.492 region:rollup2
THE DEPARTMENT'S PROGRAMS

01:57:11.124 --> 01:57:14.427 region:rollup2
HISTORICALLY HAVE AT A HIGH

01:57:12.492 --> 01:57:17.097 region:rollup2

SO WHILE THE REVIEW TIME LINE

01:57:21.701 --> 01:57:25.672 region:rollup2
LEVELS OF REVIEW ARE NECESSARY

01:57:24.037 --> 01:57:27.007 region:rollup2
TO MEET THE STANDARD OF LAW.

01:57:25.672 --> 01:57:29.543 region:rollup2
I ALSO AGREE THAT ONGOING

I THINK THE KIND OF A LONG TERM.

02:03:18.191 --> 02:03:22.896 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL OF THE IMPACT.

02:03:21.227 --> 02:03:24.530 region:rollup2
ON THE DEPARTMENT AND ITS

02:03:22.896 --> 02:03:26.633 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS.

02:03:24.530 --> 02:03:30.103 region:rollup2
COULD HAVE BEEN FURTHER I GUESS

02:03:26.633 --> 02:03:32.005 region:rollup2
CONSIDERED VETTED EXCEPT TRUCK.

02:03:30.103 --> 02:03:34.307 region:rollup2
WE ARE NOW OBVIOUSLY.

02:03:32.005 --> 02:03:36.776 region:rollup2
IN CHARGE OF IMPLEMENTING YOUR

COMPLETELY RECOGNIZE THAT.

02:03:44.651 --> 02:03:47.120 region:rollup2
THERE'S ALWAYS ROOM FOR

CONSIDERED?

02:03:56.329 --> 02:04:01.768 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK IT SHOULD BE

02:03:56.863 --> 02:04:03.503 region:rollup2
CONSIDERED IN TOTALITY OF HOW HE

02:04:01.768 --> 02:04:05.271 region:rollup2
PER USAGE APPROACH.

02:04:03.503 --> 02:04:07.874 region:rollup2
COULD HAVE A DISPROPORTIONATE

02:04:05.271 --> 02:04:09.342 region:rollup2
NEGATIVE IMPACT IMPACT ON THE

02:04:07.874 --> 02:04:11.010 region:rollup2
SMALLER PROGRAMS AT DCA.

02:04:09.342 --> 02:04:13.279 region:rollup2

KNOW IT MAY SOUND KIND OF.

02:04:15.949 --> 02:04:20.653 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW ROMANTIC AN INJURY TO

02:04:18.017 --> 02:04:21.654 region:rollup2
ONE IS AN INJURY AT ALL HAS A

02:04:20.653 --> 02:04:25.158 region:rollup2
SMALLER PROGRAM.

02:04:21.654 --> 02:04:26.559 region:rollup2
CONSIDERATION SHOULD ALSO BE.

02:04:25.158 --> 02:04:27.727 region:rollup2
YOU DON'T.

02:04:26.559 --> 02:04:29.262 region:rollup2

WHEN.

02:04:29.262 --> 02:04:34.500 region:rollup2
WE ARE DISCUSSING THE POTENTIAL

02:04:31.497 --> 02:04:36.502 region:rollup2
TO GOING TO A PER USE MODEL.

02:04:34.500 --> 02:04:38.271 region:rollup2
THEIR ARMS.

02:04:36.502 --> 02:04:40.440 region:rollup2
I'M NOT BE IN. THERE TOO OUR

02:04:38.271 --> 02:04:41.774 region:rollup2
ARGUMENT IS MR FEEL ABOUT IT I

02:04:40.440 --> 02:04:43.576 region:rollup2
DIDN'T ND I WOULD AGREE WITH

SMALLER PROGRAMS.

02:04:44.277 --> 02:04:47.847 region:rollup2
BUT.

02:04:46.412 --> 02:04:50.583 region:rollup2
I WOULD SUGGEST THAT ON THE

02:04:47.847 --> 02:04:52.185 region:rollup2
SMALLER PROGRAMS.

02:04:50.583 --> 02:04:54.354 region:rollup2
IF THEY'RE NOT PAYING THEIR FAIR

02:04:52.185 --> 02:04:55.788 region:rollup2
SHARE.

02:04:54.354 --> 02:04:57.457 region:rollup2
OR THEIR FAIR SHARE WOULD BE

02:04:55.788 --> 02:05:00.493 region:rollup2
SUCH A GREAT.

02:04:57.457 --> 02:05:02.261 region:rollup2

AT THAT.

02:05:06.332 --> 02:05:10.703 region:rollup2

QUESTIONS AND THE CONCERN

02:06:33.519 --> 02:06:35.655 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT IS IT IS AN ISSUE

02:06:35.455 --> 02:06:37.090 region:rollup2
THAT.

.

02:06:37.090 --> 02:06:41.294 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE. THE

02:06:38.591 --> 02:06:42.762 region:rollup2
CHARGING AND THE FACT THAT.

02:06:41.294 --> 02:06:44.730 region:rollup2
IT'S GEORGE BASED ON THE NUMBER

02:06:42.762 --> 02:06:45.865 region:rollup2
OF AUTHORIZED BOARD PERSONNEL

02:06:44.730 --> 02:06:47.300 region:rollup2
RATHER THAN ON THE ACTUAL COST

02:06:45.865 --> 02:06:50.369 region:rollup2
OF THOSE BOARDS AND AND I I

02:06:47.300 --> 02:06:50.970 region:rollup2
FRANKLYI I DISAGREE WITH THE

02:06:50.369 --> 02:06:52.105 region:rollup2
ARGUMENT I THINK IT'S THE FACT

02:06:50.970 --> 02:06:52.939 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:06:52.105 --> 02:06:54.841 region:rollup2
THAT THERE IS A.

02:06:52.939 --> 02:06:57.009 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW CREATED A COMPUTER

02:06:54.841 --> 02:06:58.945 region:rollup2
SYSTEM OR A CHARGE SYSTEM THAT

02:06:57.009 --> 02:07:00.646 region:rollup2
WOULD ALLOCATE THOSE. THOSE

02:06:58.945 --> 02:07:02.582 region:rollup2
CHARGES TO THOSE PARTICULAR

02:07:00.646 --> 02:07:04.750 region:rollup2
BOARD SHAPIRO'S BASED ON THEIR

02:07:02.582 --> 02:07:06.419 region:rollup2
USAGE. IS A MUCH MORE EFFICIENT

02:07:04.750 --> 02:07:07.987 region:rollup2
WAY OF DOING IT IT REQUIRES

02:07:06.419 --> 02:07:11.290 region:rollup2
CERTAIN CERTAINLY.

02:07:07.987 --> 02:07:12.892 region:rollup2
HE THE ABILITY FOR THEM TO TO

02:07:11.290 --> 02:07:14.393 region:rollup2
CONSERVE FOR THE ABILITY TO FOR

02:07:12.892 --> 02:07:15.828 region:rollup2
THEM TO BECOME MORE EFFICIENT IN

02:07:14.393 --> 02:07:16.929 region:rollup2
THE PROCESS AND THERE'S NO

02:07:15.828 --> 02:07:19.365 region:rollup2
INCENTIVE TODAY.

02:07:16.929 --> 02:07:20.933 region:rollup2
FOR ANYONE TO NOT USE WHATEVER

02:07:19.365 --> 02:07:23.069 region:rollup2
SERVICES THEY WANTED IS CALLED

02:07:20.933 --> 02:07:23.636 region:rollup2
THE CA FOR WHATEVER BECAUSE

02:07:23.069 --> 02:07:24.937 region:rollup2
THERE'S GOING TO BE SOMEBODY

02:07:23.636 --> 02:07:26.873 region:rollup2
THERE TO HELP. THEM AND I THINK

02:07:24.937 --> 02:07:28.107 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT THE WAY CERTAINLY IT

02:07:26.873 --> 02:07:29.408 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE A AND I FIND THAT IT'S

02:07:28.107 --> 02:07:30.543 region:rollup2
JUST THE FACT THAT YOU MAY NOT

02:07:29.408 --> 02:07:32.011 region:rollup2
HAVE A COMPUTER SYSTEM BUT NOW

02:07:30.543 --> 02:07:33.346 region:rollup2
YOU'RE WORKING ON A NEW IT

02:07:32.011 --> 02:07:35.648 region:rollup2
SYSTEM FOR. THE TRACK

02:07:33.346 --> 02:07:37.650 region:rollup2
REGULATIONS MAYBE WE SHOULD HAVE

02:07:35.648 --> 02:07:39.385 region:rollup2
A NEW IT SYSTEM TO WORK ON THE

02:07:37.650 --> 02:07:41.187 region:rollup2
PROKHOROVKA CHARGES AND AND

02:07:39.385 --> 02:07:41.420 region:rollup2
ALLOCATE THEM APPROPRIATELY TO

02:07:41.187 --> 02:07:43.289 region:rollup2
THESE.

02:07:41.420 --> 02:07:45.791 region:rollup2
THESE DIFFERENT BOARDS AND AND

02:07:43.289 --> 02:07:46.359 region:rollup2
BUREAUS IT'S THAT IT LACKS

02:07:45.791 --> 02:07:47.326 region:rollup2
EFFICIENCY AND AND AS I SAID

02:07:46.359 --> 02:07:48.427 region:rollup2
AND.

02:07:47.326 --> 02:07:49.829 region:rollup2
AND THE CONSISTENCY OF IT WHICH

02:07:48.427 --> 02:07:55.535 region:rollup2
IS. I THINK.

02:07:49.829 --> 02:07:55.768 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT END OF IT IN THE IDEA

02:07:55.535 --> 02:07:57.803 region:rollup2
OF OF.

02:07:55.768 --> 02:07:59.906 region:rollup2
OF REQUIRING THEM AND AND I

02:07:57.803 --> 02:08:00.439 region:rollup2
THINK SENATOR DODD'S CONCERNS

02:07:59.906 --> 02:08:02.742 region:rollup2
RELATED TO.

02:08:00.439 --> 02:08:05.978 region:rollup2
THE FEAR OF REAL ESTATE AND NOW

02:08:02.742 --> 02:08:07.480 region:rollup2
THE DEPARTMENT IS IS IS CRITICAL

02:08:05.978 --> 02:08:08.781 region:rollup2
TO THE HIGH COST AND THE AND

02:08:07.480 --> 02:08:11.117 region:rollup2
THAT LEADS ME INTO THE OTHER

02:08:08.781 --> 02:08:13.252 region:rollup2

02:08:20.560 --> 02:08:23.195 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVELY AND EFFICIENTLY.

02:08:22.061 --> 02:08:25.131 region:rollup2
AND THEY'RE STILL PAYING THEIR

02:08:23.195 --> 02:08:27.166 region:rollup2
PARODIC CHARGES FOR FOR THAT USE

02:08:25.131 --> 02:08:31.204 region:rollup2
IN IN THEIR THEIR COSTS BUT THEY

02:08:27.166 --> 02:08:31.837 region:rollup2
NEEDED THOSE THAN THE GENERAL

02:08:31.204 --> 02:08:32.471 region:rollup2
BOARD I KNOW HAD THAT REQUEST.

02:08:31.837 --> 02:08:35.508 region:rollup2
IN WE'VE AUTHORIZED THAT ARE

ALLOWED THAT TO TO OCCUR IN DATE

02:08:35.508 --> 02:08:39.278 region:rollup2
IT'D BEEN DENIED BY DCA.

02:08:37.076 --> 02:08:41.747 region:rollup2
WE WANT TO SEE THE BOARDS IN

02:08:39.278 --> 02:08:43.382 region:rollup2
BUREAUS. ACTED AND WORK

02:08:41.747 --> 02:08:45.418 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBLY EFFICIENTLY. CAN

02:08:43.382 --> 02:08:48.221 region:rollup2
ALLOW THEM THE AUTONOMY IN SOME

02:08:45.418 --> 02:08:49.922 region:rollup2
CASES TO DO THAT AS THEY DESIRE.

02:08:48.221 --> 02:08:51.657 region:rollup2
IN THIS CASE IT WAS DENIED AND

02:08:49.922 --> 02:08:53.793 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO BE DENIED I TALK

02:08:51.657 --> 02:08:54.961 region:rollup2
WITH THE. OTHER SIX SECRETARY

02:08:53.793 --> 02:08:57.196 region:rollup2
PROTEST ON THE ISSUE AND SHE

02:08:54.961 --> 02:08:58.164 region:rollup2
SAID WE'RE JUST GOING TO

02:08:57.196 --> 02:08:58.698 region:rollup2
DISAGREE DECEPTIVE.

02:08:58.164 --> 02:09:00.299 region:rollup2
IT IS A GREAT WELL I MEAN

02:08:58.698 --> 02:09:01.467 region:rollup2
THAT'S.

02:09:00.299 --> 02:09:03.369 region:rollup2
THAT SEEMS TO BE A.

02:09:01.467 --> 02:09:05.605 region:rollup2
.

02:09:03.369 --> 02:09:09.175 region:rollup2
ROACH THAT IS A. IS IS NOT THE

02:09:05.605 --> 02:09:10.743 region:rollup2
MOST CONSTRUCTIVE I THINK AND. I

02:09:09.175 --> 02:09:13.713 region:rollup2
THINK IF WE WANT TO SEE SOME

02:09:10.743 --> 02:09:14.914 region:rollup2
GOOD CONSUMER PROTECTION AND

02:09:13.713 --> 02:09:16.482 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE END AND QUICK

02:09:14.914 --> 02:09:18.484 region:rollup2
RESPONSIVENESS. I MEAN THE

02:09:16.482 --> 02:09:20.152 region:rollup2
DELAYS NOW WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT

02:09:18.484 --> 02:09:21.621 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF INVESTIGATIONS AS

02:09:20.152 --> 02:09:23.689 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WHAT THREE YEARS. TWO

02:09:21.621 --> 02:09:24.090 region:rollup2
YEARS THREE YEARS FOUR YEARS IN

02:09:23.689 --> 02:09:26.759 region:rollup2
SOME CASES.

02:09:24.090 --> 02:09:27.893 region:rollup2
I MEAN THAT'S OUTRAGEOUS AND

02:09:26.759 --> 02:09:29.996 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT THAT

02:09:27.893 --> 02:09:31.397 region:rollup2
THE CONSUMER BUT THE A I BELIEVE

02:09:29.996 --> 02:09:32.832 region:rollup2
IT'S JUST AS MUCH BUSINESS AS

02:09:31.397 --> 02:09:34.567 region:rollup2
USUAL WITH THE DCA. AND WE'LL

02:09:32.832 --> 02:09:35.735 region:rollup2
JUST EXPECTED AND THAT'S JUST

02:09:34.567 --> 02:09:38.137 region:rollup2
THE WAY IT IS WELL THAT'S JUST

02:09:35.735 --> 02:09:39.939 region:rollup2
IN LIKE A BUREAUCRATIC ANSWER.

02:09:38.137 --> 02:09:41.607 region:rollup2
AND NOT AN EFFECTIVE EFFICIENT

02:09:39.939 --> 02:09:43.976 region:rollup2
GOOD GOVERNMENT ANSWER I THINK

02:09:41.607 --> 02:09:46.279 region:rollup2
WE HAVE THE SENSE THAT REVIEWS

02:09:43.976 --> 02:09:48.948 region:rollup2
EVERY FOUR YEARS AND END WITH

02:09:46.279 --> 02:09:49.615 region:rollup2
THE DC AID. IN THIS IS PROBABLY

02:09:48.948 --> 02:09:53.586 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE BEST THINGS

02:09:49.615 --> 02:09:55.788 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT DOES. IS WE REQUIRE

02:09:53.586 --> 02:10:00.960 region:rollup2
THAT ALL OF THE BOARD AND FEARS

02:09:55.788 --> 02:10:02.128 region:rollup2
THE FORTY ONE OR HOWEVER MANY OR

02:10:00.960 --> 02:10:02.962 region:rollup2
UNDER YOU AS CLOSE TO THAT.

02:10:02.128 --> 02:10:04.063 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE TO RESPOND AND BE

02:10:02.962 --> 02:10:04.764 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABLE TO THE PUBLIC AND TO

02:10:04.063 --> 02:10:06.098 region:rollup2
JUSTIFY THEIR CONTINUED

02:10:04.764 --> 02:10:06.966 region:rollup2
EXISTENCE. AND IF WE CAN'T DO

02:10:06.098 --> 02:10:08.467 region:rollup2
THAT AND REQUIRE THE SPECIALLY

02:10:06.966 --> 02:10:10.736 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU HAVE AS SENATOR DOES

02:10:08.467 --> 02:10:11.303 region:rollup2
MENTION WITHIN THE. THE THE DCA

02:10:10.736 --> 02:10:12.538 region:rollup2
THE YOU KNOW THE L. A. O.

02:10:11.303 --> 02:10:14.874 region:rollup2
SUGGESTS THE LEGISLATURE COMPEL

02:10:12.538 --> 02:10:16.942 region:rollup2
BC TO REVISIT PRO RATA CHARGES.

02:10:14.874 --> 02:10:18.544 region:rollup2
ASKING COMPEL.

02:10:16.942 --> 02:10:20.346 region:rollup2
AND WE ARE WE IT JUST AS WE ASK

02:10:18.544 --> 02:10:23.082 region:rollup2
FOR THE ATTORNEYS IN THOSE OTHER

02:10:20.346 --> 02:10:24.216 region:rollup2
AREAS AND ENOUGH TO KNOW. I

02:10:23.082 --> 02:10:27.286 region:rollup2
DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S A GOOD

02:10:24.216 --> 02:10:27.453 region:rollup2
ACCEPTABLE RESPONSE THAT WE HAVE

02:10:27.286 --> 02:10:28.354 region:rollup2
TO.

02:10:27.453 --> 02:10:30.489 region:rollup2
.

02:10:28.354 --> 02:10:32.224 region:rollup2
OR DO WE HAVE TO ACCEPT IN A WAY

02:10:30.489 --> 02:10:34.193 region:rollup2
THAT THAT I THINK PUTS UNDUE

02:10:32.224 --> 02:10:36.862 region:rollup2
BURDEN ON SOME OF THOSE BOARDS

02:10:34.193 --> 02:10:38.431 region:rollup2
WITHIN DCA THAT WE ALL EXPECT.

02:10:36.862 --> 02:10:39.999 region:rollup2
AND REQUIRE THEM TO DO AND BE

02:10:38.431 --> 02:10:42.034 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBLE FOR SO I HOPE YOU

02:10:39.999 --> 02:10:43.602 region:rollup2

02:10:42.034 --> 02:10:45.338 region:rollup2
LITTLE MORE CLEARLY AND TO ME.

02:10:43.602 --> 02:10:46.672 region:rollup2
WHAT I LOOK AT THE FRANKLIN I

02:10:45.338 --> 02:10:49.008 region:rollup2
THIS IS AT THE THE PRO RATA

02:10:46.672 --> 02:10:49.842 region:rollup2
CHARGES HAVE BECOME A CASH COW

02:10:49.008 --> 02:10:51.711 region:rollup2
FOR DCA?

02:10:49.842 --> 02:10:52.912 region:rollup2
AND IT'S GOING TO CONTINUE THAT

02:10:51.711 --> 02:10:54.513 region:rollup2
WAY UNTIL SOMETHING IS DONE

02:10:52.912 --> 02:10:56.248 region:rollup2
ABOUT IT EITHER THE LEGISLATOR

02:10:54.513 --> 02:10:58.417 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE HAS TO DO SOMETHING.

02:10:56.248 --> 02:11:01.821 region:rollup2
OR DCA TAKES IT UPON THEMSELVES

02:10:58.417 --> 02:11:04.757 region:rollup2
TO TO TO LOOK AT IT AND AND FIND

02:11:01.821 --> 02:11:08.027 region:rollup2

ANOTHER AND.

02:17:48.327 --> 02:17:52.264 region:rollup2
THE DEPARTMENT ALWAYS STRIVED

02:17:50.329 --> 02:17:53.999 region:rollup2

THEN THE SYSTEM. OF A FINAL MY

02:18:01.140 --> 02:18:04.409 region:rollup2
FINAL QUESTION. YOU CAN'T REALLY

TELL US.

02:18:10.048 --> 02:18:13.585 region:rollup2
HOW THE DIVISION OF

02:18:10.949 --> 02:18:16.455 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATION PRIORITIZES CASES

02:18:13.585 --> 02:18:18.357 region:rollup2
THAT MAY HAVE? CRIMINAL END IN

ADMINISTRATIVE VIOLATIONS TO AND

02:18:18.357 --> 02:18:20.993 region:rollup2
WHAT I'M VERY CONCERNED WITH

02:18:19.758 --> 02:18:23.128 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW IS THAT THERE ARE

02:18:20.993 --> 02:18:24.696 region:rollup2

YOUR MANA CURING TRAINING. THAT

FOCUSED ON THESE ACTORS AND ON

02:18:41.613 --> 02:18:45.951 region:rollup2
IN A TIMELY BASIS BECAUSE THOSE

VERY MUCH QUESTIONS.

02:57:10.286 --> 02:57:17.227 region:rollup2
THE COUPLE AND HE IS THE ONE IS

02:57:14.491 --> 02:57:19.195 region:rollup2
IT IS DIFFICULT FROM THE REPORT.

02:57:17.227 --> 02:57:22.699 region:rollup2
TO DETERMINE EXACTLY HOW LONG

02:57:19.195 --> 02:57:24.067 region:rollup2
THE INVESTIGATION WILL TAKE THE.

02:57:22.699 --> 02:57:25.168 region:rollup2
IN ON AVERAGE SHIP FOR THE

IS REFERRED. TO THE FILING OF AN

02:57:28.605 --> 02:57:31.341 region:rollup2
ACCUSATION UNTIL A HEARING DATE

02:57:30.373 --> 02:57:33.543 region:rollup2
IS SET IN THE FINAL DECISION

02:57:31.341 --> 02:57:34.811 region:rollup2
ISSUED ITS KIND OF THE NUMBERS

02:57:33.543 --> 02:57:36.513 region:rollup2
ARE LISTED BUT THEY'RE NOT.

02:57:34.811 --> 02:57:38.915 region:rollup2
THERE'S NO REAL TOTAL OR A WAY

02:57:36.513 --> 02:57:40.717 region:rollup2
TO LOOK AT EXACTLY HELP LONGER

02:57:38.915 --> 02:57:42.318 region:rollup2
OR AN ORDER SETTLEMENT. CAN YOU

02:57:40.717 --> 02:57:43.353 region:rollup2
GIVE US AN IDEA OF HOW LONG THE

02:57:42.318 --> 02:57:45.588 region:rollup2
CASE CAN TAKE.

02:57:43.353 --> 02:57:47.957 region:rollup2
FROM THE TIME YOU RECEIVE IT

02:57:45.588 --> 02:57:51.227 region:rollup2

ISSUED BY L. A. L. J. OR IF IT'S

02:57:51.227 --> 02:57:53.296 region:rollup2
SETTLED.

02:57:51.895 --> 02:57:55.298 region:rollup2
I KNOW EACH AGENCY IS DIFFERENT

02:57:53.296 --> 02:57:56.299 region:rollup2
BUT THE. JUST AN AVERAGE OF HOW

02:57:55.298 --> 02:58:00.803 region:rollup2
LONG IT MIGHT TAKE WOULD BE

02:57:56.299 --> 02:58:04.774 region:rollup2
HELPFUL.

02:58:00.803 --> 02:58:07.143 region:rollup2
IT DEPENDS.

02:58:04.774 --> 02:58:09.112 region:rollup2
YEAH WE WE HANDLE CASES FOR LOTS

02:58:07.143 --> 02:58:10.313 region:rollup2
OF DIFFERENT AGENCIES AND

02:58:09.112 --> 02:58:11.381 region:rollup2
THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT

02:58:10.313 --> 02:58:13.383 region:rollup2
SUBJECT MATTERS AND A LOT OF

02:58:11.381 --> 02:58:15.118 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT FACTORS THAT GO INTO

02:58:13.383 --> 02:58:17.887 region:rollup2
EACH CLIENT'S WORK.

02:58:15.118 --> 02:58:19.989 region:rollup2
SO WHEN I SAY IT DEPENDS I DON'T

02:58:17.887 --> 02:58:22.992 region:rollup2
MEAN TO BE CAVALIER. BUT FOR

02:58:19.989 --> 02:58:25.061 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE WITH THE FAST TRACK

02:58:22.992 --> 02:58:26.195 region:rollup2
PROGRAM THAT THE LICENSING

02:58:25.061 --> 02:58:29.098 region:rollup2
STARTED WITH THE BOARD OF

02:58:26.195 --> 02:58:30.266 region:rollup2
REGISTERED NURSING AND BE. PART

02:58:29.098 --> 02:58:32.502 region:rollup2
OF A CASE ON DRESSING AND

02:58:30.266 --> 02:58:34.771 region:rollup2
PSYCHIATRIC TECHNICIANS A COUPLE

02:58:32.502 --> 02:58:37.740 region:rollup2
OF YEARS AGO. WE TOOK A CERTAIN

02:58:34.771 --> 02:58:39.175 region:rollup2
SEGMENT OF THEIR CASES THOSE

02:58:37.740 --> 02:58:40.610 region:rollup2
BEING THE ONES THAT ARE THE.

02:58:39.175 --> 02:58:42.145 region:rollup2
CASES THAT DON'T REQUIRE

02:58:40.610 --> 02:58:44.781 region:rollup2
WITNESSES AND WE PUT THEM SORT

02:58:42.145 --> 02:58:46.449 region:rollup2
OF ON A FAST TRACK TO MOVE THEM

02:58:44.781 --> 02:58:47.684 region:rollup2
FORWARD QUICKLY.

02:58:46.449 --> 02:58:49.819 region:rollup2
UNDER THE THEORY THAT WE DON'T

02:58:47.684 --> 02:58:52.088 region:rollup2
WANT THOSE SIMPLER CASE IS TO

02:58:49.819 --> 02:58:53.756 region:rollup2
SIMPLY GET IN LINE BEHIND ALL

02:58:52.088 --> 02:58:55.458 region:rollup2
THE OTHER CASES THAT MAY BE MORE

02:58:53.756 --> 02:58:57.694 region:rollup2
COMPLICATED.

02:58:55.458 --> 02:59:00.063 region:rollup2
SO IN THAT BATCH OF WORK WE WERE

02:58:57.694 --> 02:59:02.465 region:rollup2
ABLE TO MOVE THOSE CASES FORWARD

02:59:00.063 --> 02:59:03.900 region:rollup2
VERY QUICKLY. AND THE

02:59:02.465 --> 02:59:06.002 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATIVE PIECE THAT YOU

02:59:03.900 --> 02:59:07.604 region:rollup2
MENTIONED ISN'T PRESENT BECAUSE

02:59:06.002 --> 02:59:09.906 region:rollup2
THE CASES ARE CASTIGATED ON THE

02:59:07.604 --> 02:59:11.774 region:rollup2
FRONT END BY THE CLIENT AGENCIES

02:59:09.906 --> 02:59:13.376 region:rollup2
AND THEN SENT TO US. AND ONE OF

02:59:11.774 --> 02:59:15.912 region:rollup2
OUR REQUIREMENTS FOR TO GO INTO

02:59:13.376 --> 02:59:17.380 region:rollup2
OUR FAST TRACK PROGRAM IS THAT

02:59:15.912 --> 02:59:19.115 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING IS GONNA BE THERE.

02:59:17.380 --> 02:59:21.618 region:rollup2
SO THOSE CASES WE'VE BEEN ABLE

02:59:19.115 --> 02:59:24.354 region:rollup2
TO MOVE FORWARD VERY QUICKLY AND

02:59:21.618 --> 02:59:28.658 region:rollup2
NOW MAY BE AND AND THE OTHER

02:59:24.354 --> 02:59:31.294 region:rollup2
PART OF IT IS. THAT IF CASES.

02:59:28.658 --> 02:59:32.829 region:rollup2
SETTLE. THEIR GOING TO RESOLVE

02:59:31.294 --> 02:59:34.831 region:rollup2
MUCH MORE QUICKLY THAN A CASES

02:59:32.829 --> 02:59:37.533 region:rollup2
GO TO HEARING. SO IN THAT BATCH

02:59:34.831 --> 02:59:41.004 region:rollup2
OF CASES THE VAST MAJORITY OF

02:59:37.533 --> 02:59:42.739 region:rollup2
THEM ARE SETTLED. AND SO WITH

02:59:41.004 --> 02:59:44.273 region:rollup2
ALL OF THOSE THINGS IN MIND THEY

02:59:42.739 --> 02:59:46.876 region:rollup2
CAN BE DONE AND REALLY VERY

02:59:44.273 --> 02:59:48.511 region:rollup2
QUICKLY ON MAYBE AN AVERAGE OF.

02:59:46.876 --> 02:59:49.946 region:rollup2
YEAH NINETY TWO HUNDRED AND

02:59:48.511 --> 02:59:51.614 region:rollup2
TWENTY DAYS.

02:59:49.946 --> 02:59:53.082 region:rollup2
BUT HEN ON THE OTHER HAND YOU

02:59:51.614 --> 02:59:55.318 region:rollup2
TAKE SOMETHING LIKE.

02:59:53.082 --> 02:59:58.354 region:rollup2
A DENTAL BOARD CASE. WHERE YOU

02:59:55.318 --> 03:00:00.290 region:rollup2
MAY HAVE A VARIETY OF CONSUMER

02:59:58.354 --> 03:00:02.325 region:rollup2
COMPLAINTS AGAINST A DENNIS SAID

03:00:00.290 --> 03:00:04.394 region:rollup2
OF EACH HAD TO BEEN INVESTIGATED

03:00:02.325 --> 03:00:05.862 region:rollup2
AND ALL INVOLVED? PATIENT

03:00:04.394 --> 03:00:08.931 region:rollup2
RECORDS AND THAT SORT OF THING

03:00:05.862 --> 03:00:11.067 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S GOING TO MOST LIKELY

03:00:08.931 --> 03:00:12.769 region:rollup2
HAVE OPPOSING COUNSEL THE CASES

03:00:11.067 --> 03:00:13.469 region:rollup2
ARE GOING TO BE MUCH MORE HARD

03:00:12.769 --> 03:00:15.405 region:rollup2
FOUGHT.

03:00:13.469 --> 03:00:18.041 region:rollup2
AND THOSE CAN TAKE MUCH MUCH

03:00:15.405 --> 03:00:20.543 region:rollup2
LONGER. SO NO ONE MESSAGE WE'D

03:00:18.041 --> 03:00:21.044 region:rollup2
LIKE TO BRING BACK IS THAT IT'S

03:00:20.543 --> 03:00:22.979 region:rollup2
NOT A ONE SIZE FITS ALL

03:00:21.044 --> 03:00:26.149 region:rollup2
APPROACH.

03:00:22.979 --> 03:00:28.384 region:rollup2
FOR HANDLING OUR CASES NOR WOULD

03:00:26.149 --> 03:00:32.055 region:rollup2
I THINK IT BE HELPFUL TO HAVE

03:00:28.384 --> 03:00:35.892 region:rollup2
JUST A. SINGULAR CONCEPT UP HOW

03:00:32.055 --> 03:00:37.694 region:rollup2
LONG CASES SHOULD TAKE.

03:00:35.892 --> 03:00:39.195 region:rollup2
THEN IN THAT A HIKE I CAN SEE

03:00:37.694 --> 03:00:40.797 region:rollup2
WHERE THAT WOULD WOULD PLAY OUT

03:00:39.195 --> 03:00:42.498 region:rollup2
OF.

03:00:40.797 --> 03:00:44.834 region:rollup2
AND AND IT'S DIFFICULT TO

03:00:42.498 --> 03:00:46.469 region:rollup2
IDENTIFIER DEFINED WITHIN ONE

03:00:44.834 --> 03:00:48.037 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR CASE IN IT YOU KNOW

03:00:46.469 --> 03:00:49.372 region:rollup2
THERE'S NO ONE SIZE FITS ALL

03:00:48.037 --> 03:00:50.873 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY IN THOSE BUT.

03:00:49.372 --> 03:00:52.008 region:rollup2
IT'S OBVIOUSLY BEEN A CONCERN OF

03:00:50.873 --> 03:00:53.810 region:rollup2
OURS IN ONE ISSUE THAT I KNOW IS

03:00:52.008 --> 03:00:54.744 region:rollup2
BEEN RAISED HIS.

03:00:53.810 --> 03:00:56.946 region:rollup2
UNDER THEIR WHEN THEY WERE

03:00:54.744 --> 03:00:57.880 region:rollup2
INSTANCES WHERE BOARDS MAY

03:00:56.946 --> 03:01:00.116 region:rollup2
PROVIDE.

03:00:57.880 --> 03:01:02.051 region:rollup2
DENTAL EVIDENCE OF VIOLATIONS.

03:01:00.116 --> 03:01:04.287 region:rollup2
OF THE LAW IT DIRECTLY TO YOUR

03:01:02.051 --> 03:01:07.390 region:rollup2
STAFF WHICH DOES NOT GO THROUGH

03:01:04.287 --> 03:01:09.359 region:rollup2
A. A IS TO DIVIDE INVESTIGATOR

03:01:07.390 --> 03:01:10.560 region:rollup2
SHOW WHICH IS CLEARLY HERE'S THE

03:01:09.359 --> 03:01:11.694 region:rollup2
VIOLATION.

03:01:10.560 --> 03:01:12.962 region:rollup2
I KNOW THE CONTRACTORS STATE

03:01:11.694 --> 03:01:16.632 region:rollup2
LICENSE BOARD HAS ITS OWN

03:01:12.962 --> 03:01:17.600 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATORS AND THEY SOMETIMES

03:01:16.632 --> 03:01:19.102 region:rollup2
WILL DO THAT.

03:01:17.600 --> 03:01:20.737 region:rollup2
BORDER FOR FOR THAT OR FOR

03:01:19.102 --> 03:01:22.638 region:rollup2
FINDINGS DIRECTLY TO YOU. OF

03:01:20.737 --> 03:01:24.640 region:rollup2
WHEN THEY BELIEVE INSPECTORS ARE

03:01:22.638 --> 03:01:26.376 region:rollup2
THERE ON SWORN INVESTOR STAFF OF

03:01:24.640 --> 03:01:28.277 region:rollup2
UNCOVERED MAJOR ISSUES. ARE

03:01:26.376 --> 03:01:31.080 region:rollup2
THERE CERTAIN CASES THAT ALWAYS

03:01:28.277 --> 03:01:33.649 region:rollup2
NEED. A DEPARTMENT OF UPPER

03:01:31.080 --> 03:01:35.084 region:rollup2
DIVISION OF INVESTIGATIONS.

03:01:33.649 --> 03:01:37.286 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATOR.

03:01:35.084 --> 03:01:39.222 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATION.

03:01:37.286 --> 03:01:39.989 region:rollup2
OR CAN YOU ACT ON JUST FACTS

03:01:39.222 --> 03:01:42.358 region:rollup2
THAT ARE BROUGHT TO YOU

03:01:39.989 --> 03:01:43.826 region:rollup2
VIOLATIONS OF OF OF LONG.

03:01:42.358 --> 03:01:45.395 region:rollup2
THAT'S A THAT'S A VERY GOOD

03:01:43.826 --> 03:01:47.330 region:rollup2
QUESTION SENATOR HELL. WE

03:01:45.395 --> 03:01:48.564 region:rollup2
BELIEVE THAT THIS REPORT WILL BE

03:01:47.330 --> 03:01:50.032 region:rollup2
ABLE TO SHOW OUR CLIENTS

03:01:48.564 --> 03:01:52.201 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY WITH THEIR OWN

03:01:50.032 --> 03:01:53.336 region:rollup2
CASELOADS. HOW FREQUENTLY THEIR

03:01:52.201 --> 03:01:55.204 region:rollup2
CASES REQUIRE FURTHER

03:01:53.336 --> 03:01:57.273 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATION BEFORE AN

03:01:55.204 --> 03:01:59.675 region:rollup2
ACCUSATION CAN BE FILED? IN THE

03:01:57.273 --> 03:02:00.910 region:rollup2
ANSWER TO THE SECOND PART YOUR

03:01:59.675 --> 03:02:02.412 region:rollup2
QUESTION AS.

03:02:00.910 --> 03:02:03.713 region:rollup2
EVEN THOUGH WE CAN USE DEPUTIES

03:02:02.412 --> 03:02:05.548 region:rollup2
TO ASSIST OUR CLIENTS.

03:02:03.713 --> 03:02:07.450 region:rollup2
FROM TIME TO TIME IT DOES

03:02:05.548 --> 03:02:09.652 region:rollup2
REQUIRE SWORN FOR NON SWORN

03:02:07.450 --> 03:02:11.053 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATOR BECAUSE THEY WILL

03:02:09.652 --> 03:02:12.488 region:rollup2
BE THE WITNESSES IN THE CASE.

03:02:11.053 --> 03:02:13.756 region:rollup2
WE BELIEVE OUR REPORT.

03:02:12.488 --> 03:02:16.425 region:rollup2
WILL ALLOW OUR CLIENTS TO

03:02:13.756 --> 03:02:17.660 region:rollup2
COMPARE THEIR FREQUENCY OF CASES

03:02:16.425 --> 03:02:18.961 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE TO SEND BACK FOR

03:02:17.660 --> 03:02:21.330 region:rollup2
MORE INVESTIGATION.

03:02:18.961 --> 03:02:22.899 region:rollup2
MISSION LIGHTER AND I BELIEVE

03:02:21.330 --> 03:02:25.101 region:rollup2
THAT BOTH SECTIONS TOGETHER OR

03:02:22.899 --> 03:02:26.836 region:rollup2
OVERALL AVERAGE IS TEN PERCENT

03:02:25.101 --> 03:02:29.038 region:rollup2
SO CLIENTS CAN COMPARE HOW THEY

03:02:26.836 --> 03:02:32.074 region:rollup2
FALL. WITHOUT AVERAGE.

03:02:29.038 --> 03:02:33.676 region:rollup2
AND WE TRY TO AVOID HAVING TO

03:02:32.074 --> 03:02:35.945 region:rollup2
SEND CASES BACK FOR MORE

03:02:33.676 --> 03:02:37.580 region:rollup2
