LIKE A RECOMMENDATION THREE WE

00:53:30.907 --> 00:53:32.375
PUT MONEY IN THE BUDGET. A

00:53:32.442 --> 00:53:34.377
RECENTLY TO ADDRESS NUMBER

00:53:34.444 --> 00:53:35.045
THREE TO CREATE SOME

00:53:35.111 --> 00:53:36.513
DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS SO THAT

00:53:36.580 --> 00:53:38.381
SCHOOLS CAN LEARN AND WE CAN

00:53:38.448 --> 00:53:40.016
CREATE SOME TRAINERS TO THEN GO

00:53:40.083 --> 00:53:40.951
OUT TO OTHER DISTRICTS AND

00:53:41.017 --> 00:53:43.453
TRAIN THEM HOW TO PERFORM THIS

00:53:43.520 --> 00:53:45.255
TYPE OF ACTIVITY BUT I'LL JUMP

00:53:45.322 --> 00:53:46.456
A RECOMMENDATION BEFORE YOU

00:53:46.523 --> 00:53:48.258
TALK ABOUT THE AUDIT THE L. A.

00:53:48.325 --> 00:53:51.461
B. BOB ON IT- SUPPORT AT THE

00:53:51.528 --> 00:53:52.629
WHAT I'VE BEEN HEARING IS

00:53:52.696 --> 00:53:54.564
DISTRICTS BILL. THEY THEY

00:53:54.631 --> 00:53:56.399
PERFORM THE SERVICE BILL FORD

00:53:56.466 --> 00:53:57.767
AND THEY'LL GET AUDITED MAYBE

00:53:57.834 --> 00:53:59.369
THREE YEARS LATER AND THEN 70%

00:53:59.436 --> 00:54:01.037
OF THEIR MONEY THEY HAVE TO PAY

00:54:01.104 --> 00:54:03.139
BACK- TO WHETHER THE FEDERAL

00:54:03.206 --> 00:54:04.975
STATE GOVERNMENT BECAUSE THEY

00:54:05.041 --> 00:54:07.577
DIDN'T FOLLOW SOME SOME PROCESS

00:54:07.644 --> 00:54:09.312
CORRECTLY AND I KNOW THAT

00:54:09.379 --> 00:54:10.747
AUDITORS AUDIT THAT'S WHAT THEY

00:54:10.814 --> 00:54:12.315
DO- THEY DON'T PERFORM THE

00:54:12.382 --> 00:54:13.683
SERVICES ON THE GROUND SO THAT

00:54:13.750 --> 00:54:14.784
MAYBE ONE OF OUR CHALLENGES

00:54:14.851 --> 00:54:15.919
BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT

00:54:15.986 --> 00:54:18.188
THERE'S A DISCONNECT. BETWEEN

00:54:18.254 --> 00:54:20.790
THE AUDIT AND THE ACTION ON THE

00:54:20.857 --> 00:54:21.758
GROUND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU

00:54:21.825 --> 00:54:23.293
COULD COMMENT ON THAT I ASSUME

00:54:23.360 --> 00:54:24.828
THIS WOULD BE THE AUDITOR THE

00:54:24.894 --> 00:54:25.962
STATE AUDITOR THAT WOULD THAT

00:54:26.029 --> 00:54:27.564
WOULD THAT THAT WOULD THAT

00:54:27.631 --> 00:54:28.498
WOULD THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO

00:54:28.565 --> 00:54:29.833
ENGAGE IN THAT KIND OF EDUCATE

00:54:29.899 --> 00:54:32.102
SOME FOLKS ON THE GROUND AS TO

00:54:32.168 --> 00:54:32.736
HOW TO DO THIS BETTER SO THAT

00:54:32.802 --> 00:54:34.571
THEY DON'T. AN AUDIT SOME YEARS

00:54:34.638 --> 00:54:40.644
LATER I HAVE TO GIVE UP. A LOT

00:54:40.710 --> 00:54:41.311
OF MONEY AND PAY PAY MONEY BACK.

00:59:51.955 --> 00:59:53.489
PRACTICAL REASONABLE SENSE FOR

00:59:53.556 --> 00:59:54.958
THEM TO BUILD THEIR OWN

00:59:55.024 --> 00:59:56.359
INDIVIDUAL INFRASTRUCTURE IN

00:59:56.426 --> 00:59:58.528
THEIR CENTRAL OFFICE. RATHER IT

00:59:58.594 --> 01:00:00.396
MIGHT BE CONSIDERATE TO LOOK TO

01:00:00.463 --> 01:00:01.798
A REGIONAL OR INTERMEDIARY

01:00:01.864 --> 01:00:03.132
ENTITY THAT MIGHT BE ABLE TO

01:00:03.199 --> 01:00:05.034
SCALE THOSE OPERATIONS. AND

01:00:05.101 --> 01:00:06.336
ALLOW THE DISTRICT TO PASS A

01:00:06.402 --> 01:00:08.304
LAW THAT HAPPENING. WE THERE

01:00:08.371 --> 01:00:10.640
ARE EXAMPLES OF THAT- BUT WHEN

01:00:10.707 --> 01:00:11.741
WE LOOK AT THE NUMBER OF THE

01:00:11.808 --> 01:00:12.809
PROPORTION OF DISTRICTS THAT

01:00:12.875 --> 01:00:14.143
ARE PARTICIPATING IN THIS

01:00:14.210 --> 01:00:15.078
PROGRAM THERE IS THAT

01:00:15.144 --> 01:00:16.946
OPPORTUNITY TO GROW AND MANY OF

01:00:17.013 --> 01:00:18.781
THOSE ARE SMALLER SYSTEMS-

01:00:18.848 --> 01:00:19.849

ON. OKAY ALTHOUGH. OVERVIEW OF

01:00:28.758 --> 01:00:31.394
HOW IT WORKS I THINK- DHS

01:00:31.461 --> 01:00:32.729
CONTRACTS DIRECTLY WITH THE L.

01:00:32.795 --> 01:00:33.997

01:00:34.063 --> 01:00:35.999
DISTRICT. L. YANG MORE GLOBALLY

01:00:36.065 --> 01:00:37.433
WILL SET UP THOSE PROCESS

01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:38.868
WITHOUT THE LOCAL LEVEL. BUT

01:00:38.935 --> 01:00:39.869

THIS TELLS ME THAT THIS IS NOT

01:00:49.912 --> 01:00:51.981
AN EASY THING TO DO. RIGHT IF

01:00:52.048 --> 01:00:52.949

NECESSARY TO REFORM THE SECTOR

01:00:57.120 --> 01:00:57.854
YOU PROBABLY SHOULD BE DOING

01:00:57.920 --> 01:00:59.555
IT. YEAH I'D PROBABLY CAN'T DO

01:00:59.622 --> 01:01:00.923
IT RIGHT IS A MAYBE A LITTLE BY

01:01:00.990 --> 01:01:02.592
THAT'S WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON.

01:01:02.658 --> 01:01:03.526
YEAH BUT I DO KNOW THAT IT'S

01:01:03.593 --> 01:01:05.328
NOT LIKE. I COULD WALK IN AND

01:01:05.395 --> 01:01:07.030
JUST. FILL OUT A FORM TO BE

01:01:07.096 --> 01:01:08.998
DONE. IT DOES TAKE A

01:01:09.065 --> 01:01:10.400
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TRAINING

01:01:10.466 --> 01:01:11.501

AKRON IS. AT THE HEALTH

01:01:21.744 --> 01:01:22.979
COMMITTEE HAD LOTS ACRONYMS AND

01:01:23.046 --> 01:01:24.414

THE WAY YOU BILL MEDICARE NOW

01:01:33.256 --> 01:01:34.924

TYPICALLY AS PROVIDERS GET

01:01:36.325 --> 01:01:38.261
THESE. AUDITS LIKE THIS. WE

01:01:38.327 --> 01:01:39.495

FOR THE SERVICE UP FRONT.

01:01:40.630 --> 01:01:41.964
THAT'S THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE

01:01:42.031 --> 01:01:43.733
AND SO. SO WE'RE NOT TYPICALLY

01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:45.134
AUDITED AND THERE'S NOT

01:01:45.201 --> 01:01:47.070
TYPICALLY CLAWBACKS. BUT JUST

01:01:47.136 --> 01:01:48.271
BEING PAID SO THIS IS A VERY

01:01:48.337 --> 01:01:49.605
DIFFERENT YSTEM THAN WHAT I'M

01:01:49.672 --> 01:01:51.574
FAMILIAR WITH. AND I COULD SEE

01:01:51.641 --> 01:01:53.676
THAT- IN MY OWN OFFICE WHEN WE

01:01:53.743 --> 01:01:55.812
WERE DOING THIS- IT WAS NOT

01:01:55.878 --> 01:01:58.147
UNUSUAL TO SAY. EVEN IT WITH

01:01:58.214 --> 01:01:58.815
THE MOST DILIGENT

01:01:58.881 --> 01:02:01.184
DOCUMENTATION. THAT THIRTY OR

01:02:01.250 --> 01:02:02.485
40% OF OUR CLAIMS ARE REJECTED

01:02:02.552 --> 01:02:03.953
BECAUSE WE MISTER. CROSSING A

01:02:04.020 --> 01:02:06.022
TEAR DOT IN AND I. THAT'S HOW

01:02:06.089 --> 01:02:08.024
DIFFICULT THE SYSTEM ITSELF- SO

01:02:08.091 --> 01:02:09.692
I. I JUST WANTED YOU TO YOUR

01:02:09.759 --> 01:02:11.494

IS A CHALLENGE IS A CHALLENGE

01:02:13.463 --> 01:02:15.264
AND- WE ACTUALLY. THE MEDICAL

01:02:15.331 --> 01:02:16.732
SYSTEM ACTUALLY. AT THAT'S AT

01:02:16.799 --> 01:02:18.201
SOME POINT DID OFFER AND I

01:02:18.267 --> 01:02:18.668
DON'T KNOW NOW I'M NOT

THAT WERE DOING BILLING FOR

01:02:21.904 --> 01:02:23.506
SERVICES NOW THIS MAYBE THAT.

01:02:23.573 --> 01:02:25.675
MAYBE THAT EXIST FOR THIS- FOR

01:02:25.741 --> 01:02:27.110
THIS PROGRAM I'M NOT AWARE.

01:02:27.176 --> 01:02:30.947
WHAT MIKE MY QUESTION IS- HOW

01:02:31.013 --> 01:02:32.181
DID THE WORK GROUP DISCUSS ANY

01:02:32.248 --> 01:02:34.083
ANYTHING RELATED TO TELEHEALTH

01:02:34.150 --> 01:02:35.685
AND- OF THE GREATER USE OF

01:02:35.751 --> 01:02:37.286
TELEHEALTH FOR. PROVIDING THE

01:02:37.353 --> 01:02:39.088
SCHOOL BASED SERVICES. THANK

01:02:39.956 --> 01:02:41.991
QUESTION I'LL I'LL LET T&lt;c.cyan&gt;.&lt;/c&gt;

01:02:42.058 --> 01:02:43.693
JUMP IN WITH A KIND OF INITIAL

01:02:43.759 --> 01:02:45.761

THE QUESTION- SO I WANT TO JUST

01:02:52.268 --> 01:02:54.170
TOUCH ON WHAT YOU. YOUR

01:02:54.237 --> 01:02:55.705
COMMENT. BEFORE I ANSWER

01:02:55.771 --> 01:02:57.573
QUESTIONS- WHICH IS TO SAY

01:02:57.640 --> 01:02:59.408
THAT- I THINK WHEN YOU LOOK

01:02:59.475 --> 01:03:01.244
RECOMMENDATION NUMBER THREE IT

01:03:01.310 --> 01:03:02.812
TALKS ABOUT SORT OF LEVERAGING

01:03:02.879 --> 01:03:03.913
ALL OF THE DIFFERENT MEDICAID

01:03:03.980 --> 01:03:05.948
ACCESS POINTS IN NOT ONLY AND

01:03:06.015 --> 01:03:07.416
EXCLUSIVELY. THINKING ABOUT

01:03:07.483 --> 01:03:08.818
SCHOOL BASED HEALTH SERVICES IN

01:03:08.885 --> 01:03:10.620
TERMS OF WHAT SCHOOLS CAN BE

01:03:10.686 --> 01:03:11.621
REIMBURSED THROUGH THE ALLEY

01:03:11.687 --> 01:03:12.788
ABOUT BECAUSE IT IS SUCH A

01:03:12.855 --> 01:03:14.557
DIFFICULT USING THE CERTIFIED

01:03:14.624 --> 01:03:16.092
PUBLIC EXPENDITURE PROGRAM

01:03:16.159 --> 01:03:17.326
TENDS TO BE REALLY DIFFICULT

01:03:17.393 --> 01:03:18.995
FOR SCHOOLS. SO I WILL SAY THAT

01:03:19.061 --> 01:03:19.996
THERE WAS A LOT OF FOCUS IN THE

01:03:20.062 --> 01:03:21.631
WORKGROUP ON HOW CAN WE EXPAND

01:03:21.697 --> 01:03:23.766
PARTNERSHIPS WITH OTHER TYPES

01:03:23.833 --> 01:03:25.568
OF ACCESS POINTS. INCLUDING

01:03:25.635 --> 01:03:26.969
THROUGH COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH

01:03:27.036 --> 01:03:28.337
PLANS STANDS IN MANAGED CARE

01:03:28.404 --> 01:03:29.872
PLANS I JUST WANTED TO TOUCH ON

01:03:29.939 --> 01:03:31.607
IT BRIEFLY- AND THEN THE

01:03:31.674 --> 01:03:33.943
QUESTION ABOUT TELEHEALTH- SO

01:03:34.010 --> 01:03:35.444
FOLKS TALK ABOUT THAT IN THE

01:03:35.511 --> 01:03:36.946
BEGINNING. PARTICULARLY OF

01:03:37.013 --> 01:03:38.548
CLOTHING AND WHEN THERE WAS

01:03:38.614 --> 01:03:40.116
WHEN THERE WERE CHALLENGES WITH

01:03:40.183 --> 01:03:43.085
TELEHEALTH. DH CS HAS PUT IN A

01:03:43.152 --> 01:03:44.320
LOT OF EFFORT INTO LET JACOB

PUT IN A LOT OF EFFORT EARLY ON

01:03:48.491 --> 01:03:50.193
IN SCALING OUT TELEHEALTH

01:03:50.259 --> 01:03:52.862
SERVICES. AND SO AS WE SORT OF

01:03:52.929 --> 01:03:53.529
MOVE THROUGH THE WORKGROUP

01:03:53.596 --> 01:03:55.464
PROCESS NOTHING RELATED TO

01:03:55.531 --> 01:03:57.099
TELEHEALTH SORT OF. MADE IT

01:03:57.166 --> 01:03:58.634
INTO THE FINAL REPORT OR AS A

01:03:58.701 --> 01:04:00.770
RECOMMENDATION. AND THAT COULD

01:04:00.836 --> 01:04:02.004
BE BECAUSE OF THE ACTIVITIES

01:04:02.071 --> 01:04:03.372
THAT DHS WHAT THE GAME GAVE

01:04:03.439 --> 01:04:05.308

ARE TELEHEALTH ONGOING.

01:04:17.620 --> 01:04:19.422
PROPOSAL THOSE DISCUSSED IN

01:04:19.488 --> 01:04:21.958
THIS. BOB POLICIES SUCH THAT

01:04:22.024 --> 01:04:24.293
DIDN'T MOVE FORWARD. OBVIOUSLY

01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:25.861
UNDER THE- CODE PUBLIC HEALTH

01:04:25.928 --> 01:04:28.030
EMERGENCIES. WE'VE EXTENDED A

01:04:28.097 --> 01:04:30.099
NUMBER OF TOTAL COAL WITH OUR

01:04:30.166 --> 01:04:32.201
TELEHEALTH ABILITIES- WE'RE

01:04:32.268 --> 01:04:33.703
CURRENTLY ENGAGED NONPROFITS

01:04:33.769 --> 01:04:37.640
WITH STAKEHOLDERS OF. ONE

01:04:37.707 --> 01:04:39.475
WHAT'S ABILITY SHOULD MOVE. AND

01:04:39.542 --> 01:04:42.578
TO PROP SPACE- WE'VE BEEN

01:04:42.645 --> 01:04:44.680
LOOKING AT- EXTENDING

01:04:44.747 --> 01:04:45.414
TELEHEALTH FLEXIBILITY AS FAR

01:04:45.481 --> 01:04:47.316
TARGET CASE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM

01:04:47.383 --> 01:04:48.718
AND I'M LOOKING AT HOW COULD

01:04:48.784 --> 01:04:50.720
WORK IN THE- LA POP TYPE

01:04:50.786 --> 01:04:55.358
PROGRAM I THINK. THE WE EIGHT

01:04:55.424 --> 01:04:56.726
CONSIDERATION WITH L. A. PAPPAS

01:04:56.792 --> 01:04:58.127
IF THE STUDENTS AT HOME

01:04:58.194 --> 01:05:00.296
RECEIVING. ADDITIONAL SERVICES

01:05:00.363 --> 01:05:01.597
HOW DOES THE HOW DOES THE

01:05:01.664 --> 01:05:02.531
TELEHEALTH SERVICE FOLLOW AND

01:05:02.598 --> 01:05:03.933
SO DEFINITELY TAKE A LOOK AT

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:05.301
THAT DON'T HAVE ANY CONCRETE

01:05:05.368 --> 01:05:06.602
INFORMATION INSTRUCTORS POINT

01:05:06.669 --> 01:05:07.803
BUT THEY'LL DEFINITELY BE

01:05:07.870 --> 01:05:09.639
INCLUDED IN. THE ONGOING

01:05:09.705 --> 01:05:10.806
CONVERSATIONS WE'RE HAVING AS

01:05:10.873 --> 01:05:13.509
A- AS A STATE RELATED TO

01:05:13.576 --> 01:05:14.944
TELEHEALTH TECHNOLOGIES. I

01:05:15.011 --> 01:05:16.279
WOULD JUST AND JUST TO THE

01:05:16.345 --> 01:05:17.947
CHAIR JUST ONE COMMENT ON THAT

01:05:18.014 --> 01:05:19.382
I HAD EIGHTY TWO SCHOOL

01:05:19.448 --> 01:05:21.017
DISTRICTS IN MY IN MY ASSEMBLY

01:05:21.083 --> 01:05:22.985
DISTRICT SO SOME OF THEM ARE

01:05:23.052 --> 01:05:25.288
VERY SMALL SO THE IDEA THAT

01:05:25.354 --> 01:05:26.622
EACH INDIVIDUAL SCHOOL DISTRICT

01:05:26.689 --> 01:05:27.590
WITH SOME HAVE TO CREATE AN

01:05:27.657 --> 01:05:29.158
INFRASTRUCTURE HERE. TO BE ABLE

01:05:29.225 --> 01:05:30.693
TO PROVIDE THESE SERVICES IS IT

01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:32.295
GOING TO WORK AND A LOT OF

01:05:32.361 --> 01:05:33.896
TIMES THE KIDS AND SOME OF THE

01:05:33.963 --> 01:05:35.498
SMALLER DISTRICTS HAVE HIGHEST

01:05:35.564 --> 01:05:36.832
NEEDS. AND ONE OF MY COUNTIES

01:05:36.899 --> 01:05:39.068
WE HAVE THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF

01:05:39.135 --> 01:05:41.103
ACES IN THE STATE IN HUMBOLDT

01:05:41.170 --> 01:05:43.139
COUNTY. AND SO THE ABILITY TO

01:05:43.205 --> 01:05:45.875
BE ABLE TO FIND A WAY TO.

01:05:45.941 --> 01:05:47.510
CREATE A SYSTEM WHERE YOU COULD

01:05:47.576 --> 01:05:49.412
ACTUALLY USE THE- TELEHEALTH

01:05:49.478 --> 01:05:50.079
FOR SOME OF THESE AS A

01:05:50.146 --> 01:05:51.247
COMBINATION FOR MULTIPLE

01:05:51.314 --> 01:05:52.715
DISTRICTS POSSIBLY CERTAINLY

01:05:52.782 --> 01:05:54.050
AROUND MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES

01:05:54.116 --> 01:05:55.751
WOULD BE REALLY REALLY VALUABLE

01:05:55.818 --> 01:05:57.119
INSTEAD OF REINVENTING THE

01:05:57.186 --> 01:05:58.954
WHEEL FOR EIGHTY TWO DISTRICTS.

01:05:59.021 --> 01:06:01.991
SO SO I MIGHT URGE I URGE IN

01:06:02.058 --> 01:06:03.859

CONSIDER THAT- CONSIDER THOSE

01:06:05.961 --> 01:06:11.434
KINDS OF MODELS BECAUSE-

01:06:11.500 --> 01:06:12.034
OTHERWISE WE LEAVE A WHOLE LOT

01:06:12.101 --> 01:06:12.568
OF KIDS BEHIND. EIGHTY TO

01:06:12.635 --> 01:06:16.205

AS YOURS IS AND THERE IS A BIT

01:06:34.824 --> 01:06:36.692
WITH THE INTERNET BROADBAND IS

01:06:36.759 --> 01:06:39.028
IN A WOULD BE A LUXURY THAT YOU

ABLE TO TRANSMIT THEIR DATA AND%

01:06:46.001 --> 01:06:47.670
INFORMATION OVER THE INTERNET

01:06:47.737 --> 01:06:49.405

THE DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS

01:06:56.779 --> 01:06:59.515
TRYING TO WORK ON- BETTER

01:06:59.582 --> 01:07:02.585
COHESION. AS YOU'RE INTEGRATING

01:07:02.651 --> 01:07:04.153
BETWEEN COUNTY HEALTH PLANS

01:07:04.220 --> 01:07:06.689

IN THIS. BUT HE WITH THE GOAL

01:07:10.626 --> 01:07:12.561
OF BETTER COHESION. HOW CAN

01:07:12.628 --> 01:07:14.130
THIS WHOLE THING BE STREAMLINED

AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS

01:07:19.969 --> 01:07:21.670
AND- YOU KNOW WE WERE AMAZED TO

01:07:21.737 --> 01:07:23.105
DISCOVER I THINK IT WAS YOUR

01:07:23.172 --> 01:07:24.840
COMMITTEE A COUPLE YEARS AGO.

01:07:24.907 --> 01:07:26.142
WHERE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE

01:07:26.208 --> 01:07:29.278
SERVICES ANNOUNCED TO US THAT.

01:07:29.345 --> 01:07:32.348
THEY DON'T SET THE RATES. IN

01:07:32.415 --> 01:07:34.417
SUBSTANCE USE THIS WAS BACK A

01:07:34.483 --> 01:07:36.318
FEW YEARS AGO. FOR SO EACH

01:07:36.385 --> 01:07:38.254
COUNTY WAS DIFFERENT SO I'M

01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:39.355
ASSUMING IN THIS CASE EACH

01:07:39.422 --> 01:07:40.456
COUNTY IS DIFFERENT HELD THEIR

01:07:40.523 --> 01:07:41.824
HANDLING OF HOW THEY'RE

01:07:41.891 --> 01:07:44.560
PROCESSING IT HOW. THEY WORK

01:07:44.627 --> 01:07:45.561
WITH THE DIFFERENT HEALTH

01:07:45.628 --> 01:07:47.530
PLANS. I MEAN I I'M JUST

01:07:47.596 --> 01:07:50.199
ASSUMING THAT. SO WOULD I MEAN

01:07:50.266 --> 01:07:53.736
BETTER COHESION WOULD BE A GOAL.

01:07:53.803 --> 01:07:55.571
IS THERE EFFORT OR IS THERE

01:07:55.638 --> 01:07:56.005
SOME WAY YOU CAN BE

01:07:56.071 --> 01:07:58.441
STANDARDIZED. SO EVERY COUNTY

01:07:58.507 --> 01:08:00.743
ISN'T RECREATING THE WHEEL OR

01:08:00.810 --> 01:08:02.578
YOU KNOW EACH LITTLE SCHOOL

01:08:02.645 --> 01:08:03.679
DISTRICTS OF THAT AND IT COULD

01:08:03.746 --> 01:08:06.916
BE MORE- INTERNET BASED OR YOU

01:08:06.982 --> 01:08:09.485
KNOW USER FRIENDLY- BECAUSE I

01:08:09.552 --> 01:08:10.519
THINK IF THE MORE WE CAN

01:08:10.586 --> 01:08:11.754
STANDARDIZE IT THE MORE WE CAN

01:08:11.821 --> 01:08:13.289
STREAMLINE THE MORE EFFICIENT

01:08:13.355 --> 01:08:14.757
THE USE OF FUNDS WILL BE AND

01:08:14.824 --> 01:08:16.392
THE MORE KIDS CAN GET ACCESS.

01:08:16.459 --> 01:08:20.095
SO I JUST I ON. THE WITH THAT

01:08:20.162 --> 01:08:21.931
COME OUT IN THIS IN THIS IN THE

01:08:21.997 --> 01:08:23.666
DEMONSTRATION PROJECT YEAH

01:08:23.732 --> 01:08:25.968
THANK YOU MEMBER WALDRON AND-

01:08:26.035 --> 01:08:27.736
ALL ASK MISTER LAMB TO CHIME IN

01:08:27.803 --> 01:08:28.704
ON THIS ONE AS WELL I THINK

01:08:28.771 --> 01:08:30.906
THAT. IN PARTICULAR YOU POINTED

01:08:30.973 --> 01:08:32.575
TO RECOMMENDATION THREE- AND I

01:08:32.641 --> 01:08:33.976
DO THINK THAT THAT IS A SPACE

01:08:34.043 --> 01:08:35.377
IN WHICH SOME OF THAT

01:08:35.444 --> 01:08:37.146
EXPERIMENTATION AND SOME OF

01:08:37.213 --> 01:08:39.281
THAT- INNOVATION COULD TAKE

01:08:39.348 --> 01:08:40.249
PLACE TO IN PARTICULAR WHAT

01:08:40.316 --> 01:08:42.451
YOU'RE- REFERRING TO AND WHAT

01:08:42.518 --> 01:08:43.519
MEMBER WOULD ALSO REFERENCED

01:08:43.586 --> 01:08:45.921
WAS- THIS NOTION OF BASICALLY

01:08:45.988 --> 01:08:47.423
ECONOMIES OF SCALE RIGHT LIKE

01:08:47.490 --> 01:08:49.058
IT'S INEFFICIENT FOR THE STATE

01:08:49.125 --> 01:08:50.392
TO INVEST RESOURCES WHEN YOU

01:08:50.459 --> 01:08:52.228
HAVE SUCH SMALL ENTITIES. THAT

01:08:52.294 --> 01:08:52.962
ARE HAVING TO BUILD UP

01:08:53.028 --> 01:08:54.663
INFRASTRUCTURE OVER AND OVER

01:08:54.730 --> 01:08:55.898
AND OVER AGAIN AND THERE ARE

01:08:55.965 --> 01:08:57.900
ENTITIES- LIKE COUNTY OFFICES

01:08:57.967 --> 01:08:58.901
OF EDUCATION COUNTY PUBLIC

01:08:58.968 --> 01:09:02.004
HEALTH OTHER. STATE INVESTMENTS

01:09:02.071 --> 01:09:03.305
THAT HAVE GONE INTO REGIONAL

01:09:03.372 --> 01:09:05.207
ACTIVITIES THAT COULD PROVIDE

01:09:05.274 --> 01:09:06.242
SOME OF THAT RISK THAT

01:09:06.308 --> 01:09:08.143
STRUCTURE AND A RECOMMENDATION

01:09:08.210 --> 01:09:09.545
THREE AND THAT WAY OFFERS A

01:09:09.612 --> 01:09:10.813
CHANCE TO REALLY KIND OF STUDY

01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:12.481
THAT AND UNDERSTAND HOW TO. HOW

01:09:12.548 --> 01:09:14.683
TO SCALE THAT QUICKLY AND WITH

01:09:14.750 --> 01:09:16.452
THAT WITH EFFECTIVENESS THE

01:09:16.519 --> 01:09:17.720
OTHER RECOMMENDATION THAT I

01:09:17.786 --> 01:09:18.153
WOULD POINT TO HIS

01:09:18.220 --> 01:09:20.489
RECOMMENDATION TO- AND THAT'S

01:09:20.556 --> 01:09:21.390
REALLY AROUND SOME OF THE

01:09:21.457 --> 01:09:22.725
TARGETED TRAINING AND GUIDANCE

01:09:22.791 --> 01:09:25.027
TO ELEAZAR- WITH THE BUDGET ACT

01:09:25.094 --> 01:09:26.262
OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE AS YOU ALL

01:09:26.328 --> 01:09:27.563
KNOW- THERE WERE SEVERAL

01:09:27.630 --> 01:09:28.998
INVESTMENTS THAT WERE MADE INTO

01:09:29.064 --> 01:09:30.933
THE SPACE- AND THAT'S SOMETHING

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:32.535
THAT'S THAT'S- THAT'S FAIRLY

01:09:32.601 --> 01:09:34.436
NEW FOR CALIFORNIA WE HAVEN'T

01:09:34.503 --> 01:09:35.437
SEEN THOSE KINDS OF INVESTMENTS

01:09:35.504 --> 01:09:38.173
BEFORE- IN WHICH- THEIR STATE

01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:39.441
DOLLARS THAT ARE COMING ALONG

01:09:39.508 --> 01:09:41.510
SIDE. THE MARGIN OF THE FEDERAL

01:09:41.577 --> 01:09:42.878
DOLLARS TO BASICALLY OPERATE

01:09:42.945 --> 01:09:44.246
THE INFRASTRUCTURE VALLEY DOT

01:09:44.313 --> 01:09:46.448
BOB AND I SMALL. SO IT CREATES

01:09:46.515 --> 01:09:48.217
A CHANCE FOR AGENCIES LIKE THE

01:09:48.284 --> 01:09:49.418
CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF

01:09:49.485 --> 01:09:50.486
EDUCATION AND THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:09:50.553 --> 01:09:53.989
HEALTH CARE SERVICES. TO MAKE

01:09:54.056 --> 01:09:55.324
INVESTMENTS IN. THOSE I'M ON

01:09:55.391 --> 01:09:56.592
THE GROUND THAT ARE HAVING TO

01:09:56.659 --> 01:09:58.327
OPERATE THE STRUCTURES. TO

01:09:58.394 --> 01:09:59.395
CREATE MORE EFFECTIVENESS

01:09:59.461 --> 01:10:01.130
CREATE MORE EFFICIENCY FROM-

01:10:01.196 --> 01:10:02.131
THOSE KINDS OF TRAINING AND

01:10:02.197 --> 01:10:03.999
SUPPORT SO. SO REALLY

01:10:04.066 --> 01:10:05.401
RECOGNITION TO IN THREE KIND OF

01:10:05.467 --> 01:10:07.469
HELP TO ADDRESS SOME PART

01:10:07.536 --> 01:10:08.637
NUMBER WALDRON- PART YOUR

01:10:08.704 --> 01:10:11.407
QUESTION BUT- MISTER LAMB WHAT

01:10:11.473 --> 01:10:12.041
WHAT ELSE WOULD YOU. YOU ADD TO

01:10:12.107 --> 01:10:15.010
THAT. YEAH I WOULD JUST NOTE

01:10:15.077 --> 01:10:20.115
THAT. D. L. A. BOB PROGRAM HAS

01:10:20.182 --> 01:10:21.984
TRANSITIONED MARC TO-

01:10:22.051 --> 01:10:24.353
ELECTRONIC BASIS IN THE LAST

01:10:24.420 --> 01:10:25.421
YEAR TO WHEN NO LONGER

01:10:25.487 --> 01:10:27.656
REQUIRING PHYSICAL HARM

01:10:27.723 --> 01:10:29.358
SIGNATURES ON DOCUMENTS ARE

01:10:29.425 --> 01:10:30.793
SUBMITTED TO THE DEPARTMENT

01:10:30.859 --> 01:10:32.561
LOOKING AT HOW WE CAN EASE SOME

01:10:32.628 --> 01:10:33.062
OF THOSE ADMINISTRATIVE

01:10:33.128 --> 01:10:35.764
BURDENS- I WOULD NOTE THAT THE

01:10:35.831 --> 01:10:36.732
UP THE RUNOFF PROGRAM THEY

01:10:36.799 --> 01:10:38.601
NOTICE ONE OF OUR OTHER BIG CP

01:10:38.667 --> 01:10:40.035
PROGRAMS IN THE STATE SO IT IS

01:10:40.102 --> 01:10:41.570
ALSO CURRENTLY AUDITS COSTS

01:10:41.637 --> 01:10:43.272
WE'RE LOOKING TO CHANGE THAT IN

01:10:43.339 --> 01:10:45.374
OUR- OF THIS PART OF OUR

01:10:45.441 --> 01:10:48.277
KILLING PROPOSAL. BEYOND

01:10:48.344 --> 01:10:51.814
LOOKING. AT L. A. POP I THINK.

01:10:51.880 --> 01:10:52.281
WHAT IMPORTANT A WRECK

01:10:52.348 --> 01:10:54.049
THROUGHOUT THIS ENTIRE. IS THAT

01:10:54.116 --> 01:10:54.950
THE ONLY BOXER IS LOOKING FOR

01:10:55.017 --> 01:10:56.385
PURPOSE TRYING FEDERAL

01:10:56.452 --> 01:10:58.821
REIMBURSED. FOR SERVICES

01:10:58.887 --> 01:11:00.489
PROVIDING SCHOOLS BUT THERE ARE

01:11:00.556 --> 01:11:02.424
CERTAINLY TECHNICAL LIMITATIONS

01:11:02.491 --> 01:11:04.126
TO HOW THAT CAN BE ROLLED OUT

01:11:04.193 --> 01:11:06.695
ONE OF WHICH AND- PRESS MAINLY

01:11:06.762 --> 01:11:08.330
IS NOT BOTHERING TO COST. AND

01:11:08.397 --> 01:11:10.299
SO YOU'LL SEE YOUR IN DIFFERENT

01:11:10.366 --> 01:11:11.433
AREAS OF THE STATE IT'S

01:11:11.500 --> 01:11:13.402
SIGNIFICANTLY MORE EXPENSIVE TO

01:11:13.469 --> 01:11:15.404
SERVICE FOR. AND A FISHERIES

01:11:15.471 --> 01:11:16.538
WHICH MEANS THOSE THERE IS A

01:11:16.605 --> 01:11:18.007
BAR BECAUSE IT COSTS MORE

01:11:18.073 --> 01:11:19.742
WHEREAS OTHER AREAS WHERE IT'S

01:11:19.808 --> 01:11:21.710
LESS EXPENSIVE. GET REIMBURSED

01:11:21.777 --> 01:11:24.947
THAT THAT LOWER RATE- UP. IN MY

01:11:25.014 --> 01:11:26.215
TESTIMONY I'LL GO TO A COUPLE

01:11:26.281 --> 01:11:27.149
OF INITIATIVES THAT WEREN'T

01:11:27.216 --> 01:11:28.484
GOOD IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE

01:11:28.550 --> 01:11:30.219
BUDGET LIKE ARE LOOKING AT. HOW

01:11:30.285 --> 01:11:32.821
DO WE INCREASE SCHOOL BASED

01:11:32.888 --> 01:11:35.057
SERVICES AND REIMBURSEMENT. OF

01:11:35.124 --> 01:11:36.392
LA BOB AND THROUGH THOSE

01:11:36.458 --> 01:11:38.460
OPTIONS I THINK. WE HAVE A

01:11:38.527 --> 01:11:39.862
CHANCE TO STANDARDIZE THE

01:11:39.928 --> 01:11:41.730
PROCESS AND KIND OF GIVE YOU

01:11:41.797 --> 01:11:43.666
SOME OF THOSE ADMINISTRATORS.

01:11:43.732 --> 01:11:44.400
GET AWAY FROM THE

01:11:44.466 --> 01:11:45.968
ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN SPECIFIC

01:11:46.035 --> 01:11:47.770
TO L. A. BACH. SO THIS IS

01:11:47.836 --> 01:11:49.405
DEFINITELY A TOPIC THAT WE ARE

01:11:49.471 --> 01:11:50.673
EXPLORING RIGHT BEACH DOESN'T

01:11:50.739 --> 01:11:53.142
HAVE. A LOT OF A LOT OF FUNDING

01:11:53.208 --> 01:11:57.613

WEEKS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND

01:11:59.615 --> 01:12:00.082
I THINK ONE OF THINGS I'M

01:12:00.149 --> 01:12:01.583
STRUGGLING HERE WITH IS IT THE

01:12:01.650 --> 01:12:02.885
PERSON WHO BILLS THAT NEED TO

01:12:02.951 --> 01:12:04.520
CHANGE THEIR PRACTICES OR IS

01:12:04.586 --> 01:12:05.854
THAT THE AUDITOR. THE NEEDS

01:12:05.921 --> 01:12:07.556
CHANGE THEIR PRACTICES IT OR IS

01:12:07.623 --> 01:12:08.657
IT SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN BUT

01:12:08.724 --> 01:12:09.692
WE'LL HAVE THAT CONVERSATION

01:12:09.758 --> 01:12:12.127
LATER A DOCTOR ARAMBULA. THANK

01:12:12.194 --> 01:12:13.195

01:12:13.262 --> 01:12:15.297
AND- I WANT TO GO BACK TO ONE

01:12:15.364 --> 01:12:15.964
OF THE COMMENTS REGARDING

01:12:16.031 --> 01:12:17.966
SHARED OWNERSHIP AND MAKING

01:12:18.033 --> 01:12:19.468
SURE THAT WE'RE- PLACING THE

01:12:19.535 --> 01:12:21.737
CHILD AT. THE CENTER I DON'T

01:12:21.804 --> 01:12:23.739
WANT TO SOLELY TO BE A

01:12:23.806 --> 01:12:25.974
RESPONSIBILITY OF CDP. BUT FOR

01:12:26.041 --> 01:12:27.876
US TO RECOGNIZE THAT WITHIN

01:12:27.943 --> 01:12:29.011
MEDIC CAL WE HAVE

01:12:29.078 --> 01:12:30.779

01:31:54.675 --> 01:31:56.410
WORK. WE HAVE TO LOOK. WITH LED

01:31:56.477 --> 01:31:58.713
AND UP THE IT WAS OF HOW. HERE

01:31:58.779 --> 01:32:00.047
THE CREEPING UP. IT ISN'T A

01:32:00.114 --> 01:32:01.682
SOMEBODY TO BID. IT'S SOMEBODY

01:32:01.749 --> 01:32:03.150
WHO CAN. CALL AND MANAGE THE

01:32:03.217 --> 01:32:05.586
ENTIRE SYSTEM WHICH MEANS THAT

01:32:05.653 --> 01:32:06.454
YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN AUDITING

01:32:06.520 --> 01:32:09.557
PROCESSES. THE TIME THAT'S NOT

01:32:09.624 --> 01:32:11.459
A ONE PERSON TYPE OF JOB THAT

01:32:11.525 --> 01:32:12.260
SOMEBODY WHO'S GOING TO OWN

01:32:12.326 --> 01:32:13.761
THAT SYSTEM IN THAT WORK. SO

01:32:13.828 --> 01:32:15.863
THEY'RE GOING TO LOOK AT HOW

01:32:15.930 --> 01:32:17.999
HOW ARE THE NOTES BEING TAKEN.

01:32:18.065 --> 01:32:20.167
OUT INFORMATION BE ADAPTED MANY

01:32:20.234 --> 01:32:21.836
HOW ARE WE CONNECTING THAT TO

01:32:21.903 --> 01:32:23.704
THE BILLING DOCUMENTS SO. WE

01:32:23.771 --> 01:32:25.172
NEED TO BUILD THAT CAPACITY

01:32:25.239 --> 01:32:26.274
THAT DOESN'T EXIST IN THE EARLY

01:32:26.340 --> 01:32:27.541
EIGHTIES RIGHT NOW I THINK THE

01:32:27.608 --> 01:32:28.476
CONVERSATIONS THAT I'VE BEEN

01:32:28.542 --> 01:32:31.379
HAVING- SINCE I JOINED IT. SB

01:32:31.445 --> 01:32:33.881
SEVENTY FIVE CAMPAIGN- IS THAT.

01:32:33.948 --> 01:32:35.783
WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE

01:32:35.850 --> 01:32:37.952
CAPACITY NEEDS ARE LEDS AND

01:32:38.019 --> 01:32:39.220
THEN IF WE START FROM HERE AND

01:32:39.287 --> 01:32:40.154
LOOK AT BUILDING THAT

01:32:40.221 --> 01:32:42.123
FRAMEWORK. THEN IT BILLS INTO

01:32:42.189 --> 01:32:43.524
THE GUIDANCE THAT WE WANT TO DO

01:32:43.591 --> 01:32:45.559
WE BILLS INTO. THE SUPPORT WE

01:32:45.626 --> 01:32:46.494
NEED TO GET IN PLACE TO BUILD

01:32:46.560 --> 01:32:48.362
IS TO. SORT OF HOW WE ARE

01:32:48.429 --> 01:32:50.064
ORGANIZING AND REALIZING-

01:32:50.131 --> 01:32:52.333
REALIGNING. WORK AT C. D. E.

01:32:52.400 --> 01:32:53.968
RELATED TO A WHOLE CHILD

01:32:54.035 --> 01:32:54.902
DIVISION THAT'S GOING TO BE

01:32:54.969 --> 01:32:57.171
ABLE. TO IMPOSITIONS TO DEVELOP

01:32:57.238 --> 01:32:58.439
THAT GUIDANCE IN OFFER THAT

01:32:58.506 --> 01:33:00.541
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. TO LEDS

01:33:00.608 --> 01:33:01.876
TO BUILD THAT CAPACITY BUT IT

01:33:01.943 --> 01:33:03.711
ISN'T. JUST ABOUT DOING THE

01:33:03.778 --> 01:33:05.313
BILL IN ITS ABOUT CREATING THE

01:33:05.379 --> 01:33:06.480
INFRASTRUCTURE AND THAT AND

01:33:06.547 --> 01:33:07.515
THAT THAT'S WHAT'S BEEN MISSING

01:33:07.581 --> 01:33:15.489
IN TODAY'S. THIS PUZZLE- I

01:33:15.556 --> 01:33:16.424
THINK I WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT

01:33:16.490 --> 01:33:17.959
THIS AS BE SEVENTY FIVE. WORK I

01:33:18.025 --> 01:33:18.726
ALSO WANT TALK ABOUT IN TERMS.

01:33:18.793 --> 01:33:20.628
OF THE WHAT DO THAT DO. SIR

01:33:20.695 --> 01:33:22.096
LOOK LIKE A I KNOW TELL CAME AS

01:33:22.163 --> 01:33:25.132
A- OPTION. IT JEFF REACHED-

01:33:25.199 --> 01:33:26.200
BEEN HAVING. WITH OUR RURAL.

01:33:26.267 --> 01:33:27.568
SCHOOL DISTRICT- PUT THERE'S A

01:33:27.635 --> 01:33:28.970
PART THOSE WHO BEEN IMPACT BY

01:33:29.036 --> 01:33:31.072
THE WILDFIRES. I THINK YOU'VE

01:33:31.138 --> 01:33:33.674
ON THE HEAT IT'S NOT JUST. THE

01:33:33.741 --> 01:33:35.910
STUDENTS IS THE STAFF YOU KNOW-

01:33:35.977 --> 01:33:36.477
MEETING WILL ONE

01:33:36.544 --> 01:33:38.779
SUPERINTENDENT. HER CONCERN IS

01:33:38.846 --> 01:33:40.514
HE SAYS HE'S NEVER. BEEN IN A

01:33:40.581 --> 01:33:42.350
POSITION I KNOW SOMEBODY NOTICE

01:33:42.416 --> 01:33:44.418
ABOUT KEEPING EDUCATORS- IN THE

01:33:44.485 --> 01:33:46.020
WORK FORCE. WHERE THEY HAVE

01:33:46.087 --> 01:33:47.688
ADULTS WHO ARE BREAKING DOWN

01:33:47.755 --> 01:33:49.357
THEY HAVE ADULTS WHO ARE ANGRY

01:33:49.423 --> 01:33:51.058
IS THAT FOR NOW SHE LIKES. IT

01:33:51.125 --> 01:33:51.993
THERE AT A BREAKING POINT

01:33:52.059 --> 01:33:53.794
BECAUSE SOME HAVE LIVED THROUGH

01:33:53.861 --> 01:33:55.629
SEVERAL WILDFIRES LOST SEVERAL

01:33:55.696 --> 01:33:57.331
HOMES WE HAVE. EDUCATORS WHO

01:33:57.398 --> 01:33:58.933
ARE HOMELESS YOU KNOW I HAVE TO

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.002
LIVE WITH OTHER COLLEAGUES OR-

01:34:01.068 --> 01:34:02.937
WHEN TEMPORARY HOUSING. SO THIS

01:34:03.004 --> 01:34:04.972
CREATING DISTRESS BUT WE ALSO

01:34:05.039 --> 01:34:06.140
UNDERSTAND THAT THIS ALSO

01:34:06.207 --> 01:34:08.376
ACCESS TO PEER ISSUE IN A RURAL

01:34:08.442 --> 01:34:10.945
AREA. SO ONE CONVERSATION THAT-

01:34:11.012 --> 01:34:12.446
I'M HAPPY. IN THE

01:34:12.513 --> 01:34:13.948
COMMUNICATIONS TEL HELP IS

01:34:14.015 --> 01:34:14.715
GOING TO BE A COMPLETE FIX

01:34:14.782 --> 01:34:16.050
BECAUSE SOME COMMUNITIES WANT

01:34:16.117 --> 01:34:17.651
THAT IN PERSON EXPERIENCE THEY

01:34:17.718 --> 01:34:19.587
WANT TO BE- BUT I BILL. SO IS

01:34:19.653 --> 01:34:21.122
LOOKING AT HOW DO WE CREATE

01:34:21.188 --> 01:34:23.124
THAT ACCESS THE KEY IS. A BILL

01:34:23.190 --> 01:34:25.192
CAPACITY PARTICULARLY IN OUR

01:34:25.259 --> 01:34:27.094
RURAL COMMUNITIES BECAUSE THAT

01:34:27.161 --> 01:34:28.262
MEANT THEY CAN'T FIX THAT

01:34:28.329 --> 01:34:29.663
THEMSELVES IT'S GOING TO TAKE

01:34:29.730 --> 01:34:31.198
ALL OF US WORKING TOGETHER TO

01:34:31.265 --> 01:34:32.666
COME UP WITH A PLAN TO DO THAT.

01:34:32.733 --> 01:34:34.168
AND ONE OF THINGS I WANT TO SAY

01:34:34.235 --> 01:34:35.736
IN TERMS WITH SOMEBODY-

01:34:35.803 --> 01:34:36.670
MATCHING THE IDEAL OF

01:34:36.737 --> 01:34:39.673
TELEHEALTH- REQUIREMENTS- THERE

01:34:39.740 --> 01:34:41.108
IS A BILL I THINK IS I WOULD.

01:34:41.175 --> 01:34:43.411
CHECK WITH THE STAFF ITSELF AB

01:34:43.477 --> 01:34:44.845
TWENTY THREE FIFTEEN- THAT

01:34:44.912 --> 01:34:46.547
REQUIRES US TO DO INCREASE THE

01:34:46.614 --> 01:34:47.648
REGULATIONS BUT THAT'S IN

01:34:47.715 --> 01:34:48.849
PARTNERSHIP. WITH THE

01:34:48.916 --> 01:34:49.717
DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE

01:34:49.784 --> 01:34:51.485
SERVICES BY TWENTY TWENTY TWO

01:34:51.552 --> 01:34:52.253
SO SOME OF THAT IS WE HAVE TO

01:34:52.319 --> 01:34:53.921
FIGURE THAT. WHAT THE PROCESS

01:34:53.988 --> 01:34:55.656
IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE. SO WE

01:34:55.723 --> 01:34:57.158
CAN TALK ABOUT THAT DELIVERY

01:34:57.224 --> 01:34:58.125
BUT BUT I THINK SOMEBODY

01:34:58.192 --> 01:34:59.560
MENTION BOARD BEING CONCERNS

01:34:59.627 --> 01:35:01.429
YOU KNOW SELL AGAIN IS HOW DO

01:35:01.495 --> 01:35:03.497
WE- SORT OF COBBLED TOGETHER IN

01:35:03.564 --> 01:35:05.299
THIS SORT OF MOMENT. OF CHANGE

01:35:05.366 --> 01:35:06.667
IN INVESTMENT AND AGAIN WE

01:35:06.734 --> 01:35:15.276
APPRECIATE THE INVESTMENT.

01:35:15.342 --> 01:35:15.910
CRITICALLY AT THE DEPARTMENT TO

01:35:15.976 --> 01:35:16.911
HELP US. B. YOU HAVE A CO PAY

01:35:16.977 --> 01:35:19.280
TO BE A PART- IN THESE KIND OF-

01:35:19.346 --> 01:35:21.048
BUT I THINK I. SAID IT'S A BIG.

01:35:21.115 --> 01:35:22.149
AND I'M NOT THE WHAT IS A- US

01:35:22.216 --> 01:35:23.284
DO. IS FIGURE OUT WHAT ANY

01:35:23.350 --> 01:35:24.685
OTHER CA. AND ISSUES THERE BUT

01:35:24.752 --> 01:35:25.653
WE HAVE A REALLY GOOD TO A PART

01:35:25.719 --> 01:35:26.887
WITH THE TO. OF CARE SERVICES

01:35:26.954 --> 01:35:28.422
SO I THINK I'M NOT GOING TO-

01:35:28.489 --> 01:35:29.590
SORT OF REITERATE SOME OF THE

01:35:29.657 --> 01:35:31.459
POINTS THAT- JACOB MENTION

01:35:31.525 --> 01:35:33.094
ABOUT. WHAT WE'RE DOING IN

01:35:33.160 --> 01:35:34.895
TERMS OF THE PROCESS IS. WE'RE

01:35:34.962 --> 01:35:36.764
PHONE CALL WAY TO PROBLEM SOLVE

01:35:36.831 --> 01:35:38.132
AND NOW YOU KNOW WE'RE QUICKLY

01:35:38.199 --> 01:35:39.667
IN A WAY THAT'S KIND OF EXTREME

01:35:39.733 --> 01:35:41.569
CONVERSATION GOT STARTED IT WAS

01:35:41.635 --> 01:35:42.837
A CONCERN FROM THE FIELD. I

01:35:42.903 --> 01:35:44.972
RESTART TO THE TEAM OVER

01:35:45.039 --> 01:35:46.507
DEPARTMENT- SERVICES RECENT

01:35:46.574 --> 01:35:47.908
WILL FIGURE OUT HOW TO FIND OUT

01:35:47.975 --> 01:35:49.443
A CREATIVE SOLUTION. BECAUSE WE

01:35:49.510 --> 01:35:50.945
UNDERSTAND THAT IF WE CAN GET

01:35:51.011 --> 01:35:52.780
MORE VACCINE OPPORTUNITIES IN

01:35:52.847 --> 01:35:53.447
THE SCHOOLS ARE SIGNIFICANT

01:35:53.514 --> 01:35:56.083
CHANGES. AND WE CAN BUILD ONE

01:35:56.150 --> 01:35:58.786
US WILL BE AFTER DOING. AND I

01:35:58.853 --> 01:35:59.820
WOULD SAY PROBABLY IN CLOSING.

01:35:59.887 --> 01:36:01.589
I DON'T THINK IN ABOUT I THINK

01:36:01.655 --> 01:36:02.523
WE TALKED ABOUT SORT OF

01:36:02.590 --> 01:36:04.658
ROLLOUT. IS THAT. SOME OF THE

01:36:04.725 --> 01:36:06.193
THINGS THAT WE'RE DOING NOW IS

01:36:06.260 --> 01:36:07.761
WE'RE APPROACHING THIS FROM THE

01:36:07.828 --> 01:36:09.930
SPACE OF. THIS IS AN

01:36:09.997 --> 01:36:10.764
OPPORTUNITY FOR SCHOOL

01:36:10.831 --> 01:36:12.199
TRANSFORMATION SERVICES ABOUT

01:36:12.266 --> 01:36:13.501
LEVERAGING A TON OF INVESTMENTS

01:36:13.567 --> 01:36:15.369
FROM COMMUNITY SCHOOLS. TO

01:36:15.436 --> 01:36:17.104
UNIVERSAL PRE K. TO THE

EXPAND IT LEARNING- IN ADDITION

01:36:21.242 --> 01:36:23.410
TO THE COMMITMENT AROUND- SO

01:36:23.477 --> 01:36:24.578
THE BEHAVIOR HEALTH DOLLARS IN

01:36:24.645 --> 01:36:26.514
HOW WE CAN INCREASE. PREVENTIVE

01:36:26.580 --> 01:36:28.482
SERVICES THIS IS A SCHOOLS IS

01:36:28.549 --> 01:36:29.717
ALSO INVESTING AROUND SOCIAL

01:36:29.783 --> 01:36:30.951
EMOTIONAL LEARNING WE HAVE TO

01:36:31.018 --> 01:36:32.686
CHANGE. THE CLIMATE IN THE

01:36:32.753 --> 01:36:34.355
SPACE OF SCHOOLS SCHOOLS WE'RE

01:36:34.421 --> 01:36:35.823
ASKING TO DO SOMETHING THAT

01:36:35.890 --> 01:36:36.957
WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT FOR

01:36:37.024 --> 01:36:38.092
DECADES BUT WE DIDN'T KIND OF

01:36:38.159 --> 01:36:39.660
MITCHELL INVESTMENT TO DO IT.

01:36:39.727 --> 01:36:41.128
AND SO BUT WE HAVE TO GET THAT

01:36:41.195 --> 01:36:43.030
BUYING FROM THEM TOO. AND WE

01:36:43.097 --> 01:36:44.165
ALSO HAVE TO DEMONSTRATE THAT

01:36:44.231 --> 01:36:45.466
WE'RE GOING TO SUSTAIN THIS

01:36:45.533 --> 01:36:47.434
BECAUSE A LOT OF SYSTEMS. WANT

01:36:47.501 --> 01:36:48.469
TO BUY INTO SOMETHING THAT'S

01:36:48.536 --> 01:36:50.905
GOING TO BE LONG LASTING AND

01:36:50.971 --> 01:36:52.273
EVERYBODY TALKS ABOUT AS WE

01:36:52.339 --> 01:36:54.008
TRANSITION. OUT OF THIS

01:36:54.074 --> 01:36:56.143
PANDEMIC BUT PEOPLE USING THE

01:36:56.210 --> 01:36:57.578
WORD THAT ISN'T DEMI WE WILL BE

01:36:57.645 --> 01:36:59.947
LIVING WITH KOBE. YOU KNOW LIKE

01:37:00.014 --> 01:37:01.849
THE FLU. SO DO WE HAVE TO DEAL

01:37:01.916 --> 01:37:02.783
WITH THE FACT THAT IF WE'RE

01:37:02.850 --> 01:37:04.952
LOOKING AT STATISTICS. WE HAVE

01:37:05.019 --> 01:37:06.654
A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF

01:37:06.720 --> 01:37:08.289
CALIFORNIA STUDENTS WHO LOST AT

01:37:08.355 --> 01:37:15.930
LEAST ONE CARE. GIVER TO GO V.

01:37:15.996 --> 01:37:18.165
WE DON'T GRIEF. WOULD DEAL WITH

01:37:18.232 --> 01:37:18.933
THE WHILE. IN THE NEXT WHOLE

01:37:18.999 --> 01:37:20.100
DIFFERENT LEVEL OF IN. TAMI

01:37:20.167 --> 01:37:21.402
GRIEF THAT HAVE TO THINK ABOUT

01:37:21.468 --> 01:37:22.503
THE- AS A RULE ARE NOT THESE

01:37:22.570 --> 01:37:24.004
PRICE. SO THE ONE THAT PIECE IS

01:37:24.071 --> 01:37:25.973
THAT WOULD HAVE THE CREATIVE.

01:37:26.040 --> 01:37:26.507
TO BE ABLE TO RISK. TO THE

01:37:26.574 --> 01:37:28.842
ISSUES IN THE MALL- AND DIDN'T

01:37:28.909 --> 01:37:29.843
REALLY TALK. THAT AS WE LOOK AT

01:37:29.910 --> 01:37:31.745
ROLE THAT WILL ALSO WORKING. ON

01:37:31.812 --> 01:37:33.514
THE STATE OF EDUCATION. TO DO A

01:37:33.581 --> 01:37:35.449
MENTAL HEALTH REFERRAL-

01:37:35.516 --> 01:37:36.917
LANDSCAPE ANALYSIS. THE SHOW IS

01:37:36.984 --> 01:37:38.352
WHAT COMMUNITIES NEED TO

01:37:38.419 --> 01:37:40.754
SUPPORT FIRST SO WE CAN START

01:37:40.821 --> 01:37:42.223
REACHING OUT TO THOSE AREAS.

01:37:42.289 --> 01:37:43.257
AND SO SURPRISE SOME OF IT IS

01:37:43.324 --> 01:37:45.793
O. ROLL COMMUNITIES- WHO NEED

01:37:45.859 --> 01:37:46.827
TO GET THE SERVICES UP AND

01:37:46.894 --> 01:37:49.964
RUNNING FIRST. SO WE CAN START-

01:37:50.030 --> 01:37:51.732
REALLY. GETTING RESOURCES ON

01:37:51.799 --> 01:37:53.267
THE GROUND AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

01:37:53.334 --> 01:37:54.568
SO LET'S NOT BE HERE BECAUSE

01:37:54.635 --> 01:37:55.302
AFTER YOU HAVE A LOT MORE

01:37:55.369 --> 01:37:56.537
QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS BUT I

01:37:56.604 --> 01:37:57.504

01:45:23.784 --> 01:45:25.686
NEEDS OF STUDENTS I'D LIKE TO

COMMENTS TO RECOMMENDATION FOR

B. WHICHURGES THE LEGISLATURE

01:45:31.425 --> 01:45:34.061
TO REVISE THE LDA BOB OUT OF

01:45:34.127 --> 01:45:36.663
PROCESS. EVERY YEAR SCHOOLS

01:45:36.730 --> 01:45:38.799
LOSE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO

01:45:38.865 --> 01:45:40.767
ALLEY A POP ARTISTS. NOT

01:45:40.834 --> 01:45:42.302
BECAUSE THE AUDITORS ALLEGE

01:45:42.369 --> 01:45:44.304
THAT SERVICES WERE PROVIDED ARE

01:45:44.371 --> 01:45:46.573
COVERED. BUT BECAUSE AUDITORS

01:45:46.640 --> 01:45:49.009
DENY CLAIMS FOR REASONS THAT

01:45:49.076 --> 01:45:50.410
FROM OUR SCHOOLS PERSPECTIVE

01:45:50.477 --> 01:45:52.946
PERSPECTIVE SEEM ARBITRARY AND

01:45:53.013 --> 01:45:56.983
CAPRICIOUS. 75% OF THE ALLEY A

01:45:57.050 --> 01:46:05.559
BOB CLAIMS. HAVE SOME. THIS

01:46:05.625 --> 01:46:06.526
LEVEL OF DISALLOWANCE IS

01:46:06.593 --> 01:46:09.362
EXTREMELY ABNORMAL AND DOES NOT

01:46:09.429 --> 01:46:11.565
HAPPEN IN ANY OTHER STATE. D.

01:46:11.631 --> 01:46:13.400
IS AN ANALOGY FOR MY DAYS AS A

01:46:13.467 --> 01:46:16.436
TEACHER IF I HAD 75% OF MY

01:46:16.503 --> 01:46:19.039
STUDENTS FAIL TO PASS THE SAME

01:46:19.106 --> 01:46:21.408
TEST OVER AND OVER AGAIN. I

01:46:21.475 --> 01:46:22.342
WOULD FIND THAT THERE WAS

01:46:22.409 --> 01:46:23.877
SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE TESTER

01:46:23.944 --> 01:46:26.980
MY TEACHING AND NOT MY STUDENTS.

01:46:27.047 --> 01:46:28.949
WHAT D. H. SIX C. S. IS

01:46:29.015 --> 01:46:30.784
REQUIRED TO AUDIT THE PROGRAM

01:46:30.851 --> 01:46:32.886
KNOW WHETHER STATE DOES IT THE

01:46:32.953 --> 01:46:35.322
WAY CALIFORNIA DOES. REVISING

01:46:35.388 --> 01:46:36.823
I'LL BE A BY PRODUCT IS

01:46:36.890 --> 01:46:39.292
ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL FOR TWO

01:46:39.359 --> 01:46:41.762
REASONS FIRST THE ALLEY A BOB

01:46:41.828 --> 01:46:43.830
PROGRAM IS CURRENTLY THE ONLY

01:46:43.897 --> 01:46:45.899
SOURCE OF SUSTAINABLE FUNDING

01:46:45.966 --> 01:46:47.334
THAT SCHOOLS CAN DIRECTLY

01:46:47.400 --> 01:46:48.802
ACCESS TO HELP PAY FOR

01:46:48.869 --> 01:46:51.371

STUDENTS. A LACK OF SUSTAINABLE

01:46:54.074 --> 01:46:56.409
FUNDING IS THE CHIEF LIMITATION

01:46:56.476 --> 01:46:58.378
THAT SCHOOL SPACE WHICH TRYING

01:46:58.445 --> 01:47:00.080

01:47:00.147 --> 01:47:02.115
UPGRADED AND MEANINGFUL

01:47:02.182 --> 01:47:04.651

01:47:16.696 --> 01:47:17.030
LACK OF SUSTAINED

BOP AUDIT ISSUES ARE THE NUMBER

01:47:23.570 --> 01:47:25.939
ONE AND NUMBER TWO REASONS THAT

NEARLY HALF OF ELEAZAR DO NOT

01:47:28.842 --> 01:47:30.544
RECEIVE MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENT.

01:47:30.610 --> 01:47:31.878
IN FACT THOUSANDS OF COUNTY

01:47:46.293 --> 01:47:48.428
CORRECT THE REASONS FOR THE

01:47:48.495 --> 01:47:49.896

RANGE FROM FIVE TO TEN PERCENT.

01:47:53.934 --> 01:47:55.735
AND IN OTHER STATES THE FUNDS

01:47:55.802 --> 01:47:57.537
ARE NOT TAKEN BACK FROM SCHOOLS

01:47:57.604 --> 01:47:59.773
FOR SUCH DIS ALLOWANCES RATHER

01:47:59.840 --> 01:48:01.208
THEY WORK COLLABORATIVELY WITH

01:48:01.274 --> 01:48:03.043
THE SCHOOLS TO FIX ANY CLEANING

01:48:03.109 --> 01:48:06.146
AS YEARS. SCHOOLS ARE TRUSTED

01:48:06.213 --> 01:48:07.881
HUBS IN THEIR COMMUNITY AND ARE

01:48:07.948 --> 01:48:09.916
EXTENSIBILITY AND CENTRALITY TO

01:48:09.983 --> 01:48:11.852
THE LIVES OF CHILDREN MAKE THEM

01:48:11.918 --> 01:48:13.954
THE IDEAL LOCATION FOR CENTERS

PRODUCTS. DECADES OF RESEARCH

01:48:17.991 --> 01:48:21.161
PROVE THAT STUDENTS ARE TEN TO

01:48:21.228 --> 01:48:22.095
TWENTY ONE TIMES MORE LIKELY TO

01:48:22.162 --> 01:48:24.764
RECEIVE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES

01:48:24.831 --> 01:48:25.332
IF THEY ARE PROVIDED IN OUR

SCHOOLS. HOWEVER AT THE ALLEY A

01:48:28.468 --> 01:48:30.270
POP AUDITS ARE NOT CORRECTED

01:48:30.337 --> 01:48:32.105
SCHOOLS WILL NOT BE ABLE TO

01:48:32.172 --> 01:48:33.106
ADDRESS THE STUDENT MENTAL

01:48:33.173 --> 01:48:34.641
HEALTH CRISIS AND THE

01:48:34.708 --> 01:48:36.576
MEANINGFUL AND SUSTAINABLE WAY.

01:48:36.643 --> 01:48:37.744
EVEN WITH ALL THE STATE

01:48:37.811 --> 01:48:39.246
INVESTMENTS BEING MADE

OVERWHELMING RESEARCH

01:48:55.962 --> 01:48:57.864
DEMONSTRATES THAT THE DIAGNOSIS

01:48:57.931 --> 01:49:00.400

REIMBURSE SCHOOLS FOR PROVIDING

ENGAGED IN THE ADVISORY GROUP

WILL HELP TO MAINTAIN A FOCUS

02:13:12.451 --> 02:13:13.885
ON WHAT SERVICES ARE MOST

02:13:13.952 --> 02:13:16.154

REIMBURSEMENT AND THE EXPANSION

02:13:28.767 --> 02:13:30.902
OF SCHOOL HEALTH SERVICES IS

02:13:30.969 --> 02:13:32.604
CRITICAL TO THE SUCCESS OF

02:13:32.671 --> 02:13:34.873
THESE EFFORTS. UNDER TO A WE

02:13:34.940 --> 02:13:36.908
BELIEVE THAT SOME DEEPER WORK

02:13:36.975 --> 02:13:38.643
ON HOW THE STATE AGENCIES

02:13:38.710 --> 02:13:40.612
WORKING WITH BOTH HEALTH PLANS

02:13:40.679 --> 02:13:42.914
AND ELLIE AS TO DEFINE WHAT

02:13:42.981 --> 02:13:46.385
CONDITIONS. NEED TO EXIST IN

02:13:46.451 --> 02:13:48.420
ORDER TO SUPPORT COLLABORATION.

02:13:48.487 --> 02:13:50.555
THAT WILL RESULT IN EXPANDED

02:13:50.622 --> 02:13:52.891
SERVICES TO STUDENTS IT IS

02:13:52.958 --> 02:13:55.427
NECESSARY. THIS SECTION OF THE

02:13:55.494 --> 02:13:56.895
RECOMMENDATIONS CALLS OUT THE

02:13:56.962 --> 02:13:58.897
CHALLENGES OF THIS EFFORT AND

02:13:58.964 --> 02:14:00.999
SUGGEST THAT ALL INVOLVED NEED

02:14:01.066 --> 02:14:02.601
TO STAY FOCUSED ON THE STUDENTS

02:14:02.667 --> 02:14:04.936
FIRST. BUT WE THINK THAT SOME

02:14:05.003 --> 02:14:06.705
SPECIFIC ACTIONS SUCH AS

02:14:06.772 --> 02:14:08.140
INTEGRATED FINANCING

02:14:08.206 --> 02:14:09.775
DOCUMENTATION AND BILLING

02:14:09.841 --> 02:14:11.376
APPROACHES SHOULD BE SPELLED

02:14:11.443 --> 02:14:14.045
OUT IN ORDER TO TAKE REAL AND

02:14:14.112 --> 02:14:16.047
TANGIBLE ACTION IN THIS AREA.

02:14:16.114 --> 02:14:17.182
WITHOUT AN AGREED UPON

INFRASTRUCTURE THAT ADDRESSES

02:14:20.352 --> 02:14:22.554
THESE CHALLENGES. IT WILL NOT

02:14:22.621 --> 02:14:25.290
BE ENOUGH FOR US JUST TO BE

02:14:25.357 --> 02:14:27.692
FOCUSED ON BEING CHILD CENTERED.

02:14:27.759 --> 02:14:30.228

IMPLEMENTATION FEEDBACK LOOPS

02:14:31.863 --> 02:14:33.465
AND I KNOW SEVERAL HAVE

02:14:33.532 --> 02:14:35.767
COMMENTED ON THIS- THE ACTIONS

02:14:35.834 --> 02:14:37.636
TAKEN UNDER THE RECOMMENDATIONS

02:14:37.702 --> 02:14:40.005
MUST CLEARLY ADDRESS ELISE

02:14:40.071 --> 02:14:41.973
CONCERNS THAT PASSED AUDITS

02:14:42.040 --> 02:14:43.442
HAVE RESULTED IN A SIGNIFICANT

02:14:43.508 --> 02:14:48.180
LOSS OF FUNDS. IN FACT. I THINK

02:14:48.246 --> 02:14:50.081
WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE FACT THE

02:14:50.148 --> 02:14:52.551
L. E. A. B. O. P. ON.

02:14:52.617 --> 02:14:54.252
DEPARTMENT THE DEPARTMENT IS

02:14:54.319 --> 02:14:56.888
FUNDED BY THE WITHHOLDING OF

02:14:56.955 --> 02:14:59.124
MEDICAID REIMBURSEMENTS PAID TO

02:14:59.191 --> 02:15:01.526
ELLIE AS THE SEEMS PROBLEMATIC

02:15:01.593 --> 02:15:03.795
TO US AND THINK WE NEED TO

02:15:03.862 --> 02:15:06.898
CONSIDER- USE OF GENERAL FUND

02:15:06.965 --> 02:15:08.934
SUPPORT. THAT WOULD FURTHER

02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:11.703
BUILD THE EFFORT UP TOWARDS

02:15:11.770 --> 02:15:13.572
CONTINUOUS QUALITY IMPROVEMENT

02:15:13.638 --> 02:15:15.407
RATHER THAN A COMPLIANCE

02:15:15.474 --> 02:15:17.876
APPROACH AND DOCUMENTING AND

AREN'T ON MEDICAID AND WITH

02:22:10.421 --> 02:22:12.457
THAT WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT

02:22:12.523 --> 02:22:14.692
PRIVATE INSURANCE HAS PARITY

02:22:14.759 --> 02:22:18.229
BOTH AN ACCESS AND IN HELPING

02:22:18.296 --> 02:22:20.198

02:24:01.165 --> 02:24:02.166
INVESTING MONEY INTO THE

CHILDREN'S AND YOUTH BEHAVIORAL

02:24:03.434 --> 02:24:05.703
HEALTH INITIATIVE. THAT THERE'S

02:24:05.770 --> 02:24:07.338
OPPORTUNITIES HERE FOR US TO BE

OF THIS PANEL AND BELIEVE THAT

02:24:19.083 --> 02:24:20.651
THE CONVERSATION WITH THE LOCAL

02:24:20.718 --> 02:24:22.086

02:24:22.153 --> 02:24:24.322
IMPORTANT. FOR US TO MAKE SURE

02:24:36.834 --> 02:24:39.437
DETAILED- BUT- THINK THAT WE

PROPOSE IN THEIR JANUARY

02:24:51.215 --> 02:24:53.785

AT THE SAME TIME- SO UNDER

02:28:53.958 --> 02:28:55.626
UNDER THE HEALTH HEALTH BUDGET

02:28:55.693 --> 02:28:57.228
TRAILER BILL AB ONE THIRTY

02:28:57.295 --> 02:28:57.962
THREE SCHOOLS WILL EVENTUALLY

02:28:58.029 --> 02:28:59.497
BE ABLE TO BILL PRIVATE AND

02:28:59.563 --> 02:29:02.033
PUBLIC HEALTH PLANS AND COUNTY

02:29:02.099 --> 02:29:02.633
MOUNT MENTAL HEALTH PLANS FOR

02:29:02.700 --> 02:29:04.001
MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. WHAT

02:29:04.068 --> 02:29:05.236
NEEDS TO HAPPEN BETWEEN NOW AND

02:29:05.303 --> 02:29:07.405
THEN- AND WIN THE REQUIREMENT

02:29:07.471 --> 02:29:08.839
THAT PLANS COVER SCHOOL BASED

02:29:08.906 --> 02:29:10.441
MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR

02:29:10.508 --> 02:29:12.410
EXAMPLE TO PROVIDERS HAVE TO GO

02:29:12.476 --> 02:29:14.979
THROUGH A PROVIDER ENROLLMENT

02:29:15.046 --> 02:29:17.648
DO YOU NEED TO ESTABLISH

02:29:17.715 --> 02:29:21.786
CONTRACTS OR AMMO USE. OKAY

02:29:21.852 --> 02:29:23.821
I'LL I'LL START. AND YEAH

02:29:23.888 --> 02:29:26.123
LYNETTE AND WITH A LOCAL BAND

02:29:26.190 --> 02:29:28.626
SO. AND I THINK THERE'S A LOT

02:29:28.693 --> 02:29:30.161
OF WORK THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN

02:29:30.227 --> 02:29:31.662
BETWEEN NOW AND THAT AND IT'S

02:29:31.729 --> 02:29:32.763
EXACTLY SOME OF THE ISSUES THE

02:29:32.830 --> 02:29:34.932
DEPARTMENT MENTIONING. I KNOW

02:29:34.999 --> 02:29:37.068
THAT THE REQUIREMENT- IN THE

02:29:37.134 --> 02:29:38.969
TRAILER BILL. AT REQUIRED

02:29:39.036 --> 02:29:40.471
REIMBURSEMENT REGARDLESS OF

02:29:40.538 --> 02:29:42.540
NETWORK PROVIDER STATUS BUT- I

02:29:42.606 --> 02:29:45.042
THINK YOU KNOW. PART OF THAT

02:29:45.109 --> 02:29:46.377
THE DAY I THINK IDEALLY THERE

02:29:46.444 --> 02:29:48.012
WOULD BE CONTACT IN PLACE.

02:29:48.079 --> 02:29:49.580
HAVING A CONTRACT IN PLACE TO

02:29:49.647 --> 02:29:51.115
ENSURE THAT THE SERVICE IS

02:29:51.182 --> 02:29:52.149
GOING TO BE DELIVERED IN A

02:29:52.216 --> 02:29:53.984
SILO. BUT THE SCHOOLS WOULD BE

02:29:54.051 --> 02:29:55.086
CONNECTED TO OUR BROADER

02:29:55.152 --> 02:29:56.821
NETWORK AND OTHER PLACES THAT

02:29:56.887 --> 02:29:58.089
CHILDREN MIGHT BE RESERVED

02:29:58.155 --> 02:29:59.790
MEETING CARE. PARTICULARLY TO

02:29:59.857 --> 02:30:01.459
THEIR PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS.

02:30:01.525 --> 02:30:03.561
SO I THINK THAT REALLY SHOULD

02:30:03.627 --> 02:30:05.329
BE THE GOAL AND NOT THAT THESE

02:30:05.396 --> 02:30:07.031
ARE SILENT SERVICES AND BETTER

02:30:07.098 --> 02:30:08.532
JUST BEING BILLED WITHOUT A

02:30:08.599 --> 02:30:09.600
CONNECTION YOU KIND OF THE

02:30:09.667 --> 02:30:11.235
BROADER ARRAY OF SERVICES. THAT

02:30:11.302 --> 02:30:14.638
CAN BE- RECEDING. SO I THINK IT

02:30:14.705 --> 02:30:16.941
IS WORKING TOWARD IDENTIFYING

02:30:17.007 --> 02:30:22.046
THE NEED- TO WORK TOWARD

02:30:22.113 --> 02:30:23.314
CONTRACT. I WOULD JUST PARA

02:30:23.381 --> 02:30:25.015
RIGHT NOW WITH. EMPLOYMENT HE

02:30:25.082 --> 02:30:26.751
PLAN I THINK WILL BE. A LOT OF

02:30:26.817 --> 02:30:30.521
SORT OF. ISSUES AS WORKS. AND

02:30:30.588 --> 02:30:31.889
WORKING WITH COMMUNITY BASED

02:30:31.956 --> 02:30:33.557
ORGANIZATIONS THAT HISTORICALLY

02:30:33.624 --> 02:30:36.260
ARE NOT MANAGED CARE PROVIDERS-

02:30:36.327 --> 02:30:39.463
THAT WILL NEED TO- HAVE CLAIMS

02:30:39.530 --> 02:30:41.432
AND BILLING SYSTEMS IN PLACE.

02:30:41.499 --> 02:30:43.901
LEARN HOW TO SUBMIT A CLAIM-

02:30:43.968 --> 02:30:46.504
THE SHARED DATA- AND A LOT OF

02:30:46.570 --> 02:30:48.672
THE- INFRASTRUCTURE ISSUES AND

02:30:48.739 --> 02:30:51.108
THEY CATCH ON I THINK ANOTHER-

02:30:51.175 --> 02:30:52.510
THE ISSUE THAT. I THINK IS

02:30:52.576 --> 02:30:54.745
WORTH FURTHER DISCUSSION IS

02:30:54.812 --> 02:30:57.481
PROVIDER TYPE- I DON'T BELIEVE

02:30:57.548 --> 02:30:59.417
THERE IS. THIRD ALIGNMENT TODAY

02:30:59.483 --> 02:31:00.851
OR THERE'S SOME OVERLAP BUT NOT

02:31:00.918 --> 02:31:02.686
COMPLETE ALIGNMENT BETWEEN. THE

02:31:02.753 --> 02:31:04.655
TYPES OF PROVIDERS THAT ARE

02:31:04.722 --> 02:31:07.124
AUTHORIZED TO PROVIDE SERVICES

02:31:07.191 --> 02:31:08.058
THROUGH THE ALLEY BUILDING

02:31:08.125 --> 02:31:09.293
PROGRAM. BIRTH OF THOSE

02:31:09.360 --> 02:31:11.061
PROVIDERS THEY'RE ALLOWED TO

02:31:11.128 --> 02:31:13.297
PROVIDE SERVICES NOT MODERATE

02:31:13.364 --> 02:31:15.065
SERVICES AND COVERED BY THE

02:31:15.132 --> 02:31:16.967
MANAGED CARE PLAN. I THINK IT'S

02:31:17.034 --> 02:31:18.002
A COMBINATION OF ALL THOSE

02:31:18.068 --> 02:31:19.336
ISSUES AND I THINK IT'S GOING

02:31:19.403 --> 02:31:21.005
TO BE A LOT OF WORK OVER THE

02:31:21.071 --> 02:31:26.677
NEXT TWO YEARS- TO WORK.

02:31:26.744 --> 02:31:27.278

FAMILY THERAPIST BECAUSE- THERE

02:31:33.484 --> 02:31:34.585

ALLOW BOTH TO PROVIDE. A BILL

PROVIDER THAT FEELS THAT.

02:34:53.283 --> 02:34:54.318
THEY'RE ADDING THAT THEY'RE

02:34:54.385 --> 02:34:56.020
ACTUALLY COMPENSATED FOR THE

02:34:56.086 --> 02:34:58.522
SERVICES THEY PROVIDE- MANY OF

02:34:58.589 --> 02:34:59.390
US WHO PROVIDED MEDICAL

02:34:59.456 --> 02:35:01.992
SERVICES. OF LOST MONEY TO

02:35:02.059 --> 02:35:03.494
PROVIDE THOSE SERVICES FOR THE

02:35:03.560 --> 02:35:04.762
PRIVILEGE OF TAKING CARE OF THE

02:35:04.828 --> 02:35:07.031
PEOPLE WHO NEED IT THE MOST- IN

02:35:07.097 --> 02:35:09.233
IN DENTISTRY FOR EXAMPLE-

02:35:09.299 --> 02:35:10.968
REIMBURSEMENT WAS THIRTY FIVE

02:35:11.035 --> 02:35:12.302
PERCENT. OF WHAT MY USUAL

02:35:12.369 --> 02:35:13.570
CUSTOMARY REASONABLE FEES MY

02:35:13.637 --> 02:35:16.040
OVERHEAD WAS 72% SO EVERY TIME

02:35:16.106 --> 02:35:17.374
I SAW A PATIENT. WHICH I

02:35:17.441 --> 02:35:20.010
ABSOLUTELY- GLADLY DID. IT COST

02:35:20.077 --> 02:35:22.212
ME MONEY AND SO. SO AND I

02:35:22.279 --> 02:35:23.247
DIDN'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO

02:35:23.313 --> 02:35:26.116
LEVERAGE- ANY RESOURCES AS A

02:35:26.183 --> 02:35:28.085
PRIVATE PRACTITIONER SO. SO I

JUST A WELCOME TO MEDICARE. AND

02:35:30.721 --> 02:35:33.624
AND- AND IT'S IN AND WHAT I

02:35:33.691 --> 02:35:34.224
JUST WANNA CLOSE WITH THIS AND

02:35:34.291 --> 02:35:35.292
I'LL MAKE THIS MY CLOSING

02:35:35.359 --> 02:35:37.294
STATEMENT TO THE CHAIR- IS

02:35:37.361 --> 02:35:41.732
THAT- THE- IT'S- I THINK. HE HE

02:35:41.799 --> 02:35:42.633
NAILED IT WITH THEIR NO

02:35:42.700 --> 02:35:43.600
QUESTION ABOUT THAT WE NEED TO

02:35:43.667 --> 02:35:46.770
DO THIS IS HOW WE DO THIS. AND

02:35:46.837 --> 02:35:48.338
YOU KNOW THROUGH JUST THE IT'S

02:35:48.405 --> 02:35:50.207
A VERY COMPLICATED TO BILL FOR

02:35:50.274 --> 02:35:51.975
THE SERVICES AND SO AS I SAID

02:35:52.042 --> 02:35:54.078
EARLIER. REJECTION OF A CLAIM

02:35:54.144 --> 02:35:56.213
WAS USUALLY WHAT HAPPENS IN THE

02:35:56.280 --> 02:35:57.614
MEDICAL AND THE MEDICAL ENDOF

02:35:57.681 --> 02:36:00.250
THIS- AUDITS. HAPPEN WITH

02:36:00.317 --> 02:36:03.320
LARGER ENTITIES. OUT THERE- BUT

02:36:03.387 --> 02:36:04.488
INDIVIDUAL PRACTITIONERS DON'T

02:36:04.555 --> 02:36:06.423
USUALLY RICK'S PERRANCE AUDITS

02:36:06.490 --> 02:36:08.225
LIKE THAT. SO IT'S MORE IT'S

02:36:08.292 --> 02:36:09.026
MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO GET

02:36:09.093 --> 02:36:14.298
PAID- 75% OF CLIP OF CLAIMS ARE

02:36:14.364 --> 02:36:16.467
BEING REJECTED. IS- IS

02:36:16.533 --> 02:36:19.236
APPALLING- AND IT AND IT POINTS

02:36:19.303 --> 02:36:21.171
TO A HUGE A HUGE DISCONNECT

02:36:21.238 --> 02:36:23.407
SOMEWHERE TO THE PROCESS. AND

02:36:23.474 --> 02:36:26.176
SO I DON'T AND- BOY HERE I I'M

02:36:26.243 --> 02:36:27.678
GONNA I'M GNNA SAY I'M GONNA.

02:36:27.745 --> 02:36:29.813
SAY WHAT I'M THINKING- WITHOUT

02:36:29.880 --> 02:36:30.681
KNOWING SOMETHING WHICH IS

02:36:30.748 --> 02:36:33.283
ALWAYS DANGEROUS. BUT BECAUSE

02:36:33.350 --> 02:36:34.818
WE'RE TRYING TO DO SOMETHING

02:36:34.885 --> 02:36:36.820
DIFFERENT. TRY TO DO SOMETHING

02:36:36.887 --> 02:36:40.124
NEW- I WONDER IF THERE IS A IS

02:36:40.190 --> 02:36:42.526
AN INNOVATION WAIVER. SOMEWHERE

02:36:42.593 --> 02:36:44.561
THROUGH THE PROCESS THAT DH CS

02:36:44.628 --> 02:36:47.264
COULD WORK ON. TO HELP. BECAUSE

02:36:47.331 --> 02:36:48.665
WE WANT TO SEE THE BIGGER WE

02:36:48.732 --> 02:36:50.234
WANT TO SEE THE OUTCOMES AND

02:36:50.300 --> 02:36:51.735
RECOGNIZE THAT THAT THEY

02:36:51.802 --> 02:36:52.870
GETTING THERE MIGHT BE A LITTLE

02:36:52.936 --> 02:36:55.205
BIT. CLUNKY FOR LACK OF A

02:36:55.272 --> 02:36:56.840
BETTER DESCRIPTION. WE DON'T

02:36:56.907 --> 02:36:58.542
WANT TO PENALIZE PROVIDERS FROM

02:36:58.609 --> 02:37:00.344
ACTUALLY DOING THIS WORK. WE

02:37:00.410 --> 02:37:01.545
WANT TO ENCOURAGE IT AND THEN

02:37:01.612 --> 02:37:03.680
SEE THE RESULTS AND SO. IF

02:37:03.747 --> 02:37:05.883
THERE COULD BE A WAY TO REDUCE

02:37:05.949 --> 02:37:07.417
SOME OF THE RIGIDITY THAT WE

02:37:07.484 --> 02:37:09.419
SEE WITH- WITH REGULATIONS

02:37:09.486 --> 02:37:11.388
AROUND- DOTTING THE TEASING

02:37:11.455 --> 02:37:13.090
CROSS IN THE EYES AND- AND

02:37:13.157 --> 02:37:14.858
MAKING SURE THE DOCUMENTATION

02:37:14.925 --> 02:37:15.793
SAYS EXACTLY WHAT IT NEEDS TO

02:37:15.859 --> 02:37:18.629
SAY. THAT WOULD BE ONE OF THOSE

02:37:18.695 --> 02:37:19.563
THINGS THAT I THINK COULD BE

02:37:19.630 --> 02:37:21.632
HELPFUL. AND IF THAT IS THE

02:37:21.698 --> 02:37:26.470
CASE- THE DH CS MIGHT AGREE OR

02:37:26.537 --> 02:37:28.038
NOT AGREE. I IF COULD POINT US

02:37:28.105 --> 02:37:30.774
TOWARDS YOU KNOW IF THEY NEED

02:37:30.841 --> 02:37:31.341
