MAKING THIS HAPPEN- VERY

00:48:31.675 --> 00:48:32.909
SUPPORTIVE OF THIS BUT THERE IS

00:48:32.976 --> 00:48:33.944
ONE THING I THINK WE'RE GOING

00:48:34.011 --> 00:48:35.612
TO HAVE TO CONTINUE TO MONITOR.

00:48:35.679 --> 00:48:37.214
AND THAT IS THE- COMPONENT

00:48:37.281 --> 00:48:40.417
SPEAKS TO ATTEND FIRST THE 10%

00:48:40.484 --> 00:48:40.951
SET ASIDE FOR THE TEACHER

VACCINATIONS. I WAS VERY

00:48:42.085 --> 00:48:43.920

VACCINATED I'VE HAD COVERED I

00:48:56.833 --> 00:48:58.335
THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT. THAT

00:48:58.402 --> 00:48:59.603
WE GET OUR TEACHERS VACCINATED

00:48:59.670 --> 00:49:01.538
I KNOW THAT'S ONE COMPONENT OF

00:49:01.605 --> 00:49:04.107
THIS BILL. A 10% SET ASIDE. BUT

00:49:04.174 --> 00:49:05.976
I REALLY URGE. THE EXECUTIVE

BRANCH. BECAUSE YOU'RE GONNA BE

00:49:07.311 --> 00:49:08.979
IMPLEMENTING THIS. TO ENSURE

00:49:09.046 --> 00:49:11.114
THAT ACROSS THE STATE- WE ARE

00:49:11.181 --> 00:49:12.916
MONITORING THE COUNTIES TO MAKE

00:49:12.983 --> 00:49:14.318
SURE THAT THEY'RE PUSHING THOSE

00:49:14.384 --> 00:49:16.453
VACCINES OUT TO OUR TEACHERS-

00:49:16.520 --> 00:49:17.621
WHETHER IT BE THE TWO DOSE

00:49:17.688 --> 00:49:18.989
VACCINE NOW APPARENTLY THERE'S

00:49:19.056 --> 00:49:20.424
THE ONE DOES THE JOHNSON AND

00:49:20.490 --> 00:49:21.591
JOHNSON MAYBE THAT WOULD BE THE

00:49:21.658 --> 00:49:23.026
ONE TO SET ASIDE. BECAUSE THE

00:49:23.093 --> 00:49:25.495
TIMELINE MIGHT BE TRUNCATED.

00:49:25.562 --> 00:49:25.996
FOR TEACHERS TO BE FULLY

00:49:26.063 --> 00:49:27.931
VACCINATED I'M NOT A SCIENTIST

00:49:27.998 --> 00:49:28.932
I DON'T KNOW. I KNOW SOME

00:49:28.999 --> 00:49:30.500
ASIDE- WE DON'T NEED TO DO THAT

00:49:30.567 --> 00:49:33.103
THERE'S THE CDC. WELL THE CDC'S

00:49:33.170 --> 00:49:35.439
BEEN RATHER INCONSISTENT. ON

00:49:35.505 --> 00:49:36.340
WHETHER OR NOT TEACHERS SHOULD

00:49:36.406 --> 00:49:38.608
RETURN TO THE CLASSROOM- EVEN

00:49:38.675 --> 00:49:40.043
DR FAUCI LAST WEEK. I WAS

00:49:40.110 --> 00:49:42.412
WATCHING ONE SUNDAY SHOWS. WHEN

00:49:42.479 --> 00:49:44.081

CLASSROOM AS A TEACHER- HE

00:49:47.584 --> 00:49:49.453
WOULDN'T ANSWER THAT QUESTION.

00:49:49.519 --> 00:49:50.821
IT'S JUST COMMON SENSE AND WE

00:49:50.887 --> 00:49:52.089
CAN DO IT. SO IT'S VERY

00:49:52.155 --> 00:49:54.791
IMPORTANT TO ME. THAT WE FOCUS

00:49:54.858 --> 00:49:56.593
ON GETTING THOSE VACCINES OUT

00:49:56.660 --> 00:49:58.595
AND INTO THE ARMS OF TEACHERS.

00:49:58.662 --> 00:50:00.664
SO THAT WE CAN GET OUR KIDS

00:50:00.731 --> 00:50:03.367
BACK. INTO SCHOOL. AND ANOTHER

00:50:03.433 --> 00:50:04.234
THING THAT WE SHOULD CELEBRATED

00:50:04.301 --> 00:50:05.168
JUNE IT'S BEEN IT'S BEEN A

00:50:05.235 --> 00:50:06.770
LITTLE TOO HERE. IS CERTAINLY

00:50:06.837 --> 00:50:07.871
IT'S THE ROOT IT'S GETTING OUR

00:50:07.938 --> 00:50:09.106
KIDS BACK INTO THE CLASSROOM

00:50:09.172 --> 00:50:10.507
BUT THE LEARNING LOS COMPONENT

00:50:10.574 --> 00:50:11.141
WHICH MY COLLEAGUES HAVE

00:50:11.208 --> 00:50:12.976
SPOKEN. IS FUTURE. IT IS

00:50:13.043 --> 00:50:15.212
GIGANTIC. AT LAST IT IS NOT

00:50:15.278 --> 00:50:18.014
JUST. A ONE SUMMER THING. AND

00:50:18.081 --> 00:50:19.416
IT'S NOT LIKE THE SUMMER SCHOOL

00:50:19.483 --> 00:50:21.051
YOU MIGHT ADD. OUR INTENTION OF

00:50:21.118 --> 00:50:22.953
THAT THIS BE IS THAT IS THAT

00:50:23.019 --> 00:50:24.287

COMPREHENSIVE SUMMER SCHOOL

00:50:26.456 --> 00:50:27.224
APPROACH OVER REALLY TWO

00:50:27.290 --> 00:50:28.825
SUMMERS. BUT EVEN IN THE

00:50:28.892 --> 00:50:30.827
INTERIM- STUDENTS WILL HAVE

00:50:30.894 --> 00:50:32.462
NEEDS ACADEMIC MADE TO SOCIAL

00:50:32.529 --> 00:50:34.030
EMOTIONAL NEEDS AND THAT'S WHAT

00:50:34.097 --> 00:50:34.798
THIS MONEY IS SET ASIDE TO

00:50:34.865 --> 00:50:36.133
ADDRESS. SO IT'S NOT ONLY

00:50:36.199 --> 00:50:37.868
PROBABLY TWO SUMMER SCHOOLS.

00:50:37.934 --> 00:50:39.736
BUT A LOT OF WORK TO BRING OUR

00:50:39.803 --> 00:50:44.408

IS AN IMPORTANT FIRST STEP. BUT

00:51:45.902 --> 00:51:47.537
FOR ME I DO STILL HAVE CONCERNS

00:51:47.604 --> 00:51:48.672

OUR MIDDLE CLASS IN HIGH SCHOOL

00:52:04.588 --> 00:52:08.859
STUDENTS BACK. TO THE CLASSROOM

AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. SO IN

00:52:10.961 --> 00:52:12.362
TERMS OF A MIDDLE SCHOOL AND

00:52:12.429 --> 00:52:13.463
HIGH SCHOOL ONCE AGAIN THIS IS

00:52:13.530 --> 00:52:15.499
JUST A MINIMUM FLOOR FOR SCHOOL

00:52:15.565 --> 00:52:17.400
DISTRICTS- TO GET THEM STARTED

00:52:17.467 --> 00:52:20.036
THE INTENT HERE. IS TO-

00:52:20.103 --> 00:52:22.038
FACILITATE A SAFE FACED RE

00:52:22.105 --> 00:52:23.907
OPENING- OF THERE IS THAT

00:52:23.974 --> 00:52:25.408
UNDERLYING BELIEF IN THIS

00:52:25.475 --> 00:52:27.244
LEGISLATION THAT ADDS SCHOOL

00:52:27.310 --> 00:52:28.912
DISTRICTS GET MORE EXPERIENCE

00:52:28.979 --> 00:52:30.881
WITH SAFELY RE OPENING IN A

00:52:30.947 --> 00:52:32.549
PHASED APPROACH IT WILL DEVELOP

00:52:32.616 --> 00:52:34.684
THE CONFIDENCE NECESSARY. FOR

00:52:34.751 --> 00:52:35.485
PARENTS TO BE WILLING TO SEND

00:52:35.552 --> 00:52:37.187
THEIR CHILDREN BACK. AND FOR

00:52:37.254 --> 00:52:39.956
EMPLOYEES TO HAVE THE CAPACITY

00:52:40.023 --> 00:52:41.224
TO OPERATE SAFELY ON CAMPUS AND

00:52:41.291 --> 00:52:43.126
SO. WHILE THIS IS A MINIMUM

00:52:43.193 --> 00:52:44.361
FLOOR WE DO KNOW THAT THERE ARE

00:52:44.427 --> 00:52:45.996
MANY ELEAZAR ACROSS THE STATE

00:52:46.062 --> 00:52:47.030
THAT HAVE MUCH MORE

00:52:47.097 --> 00:52:48.665
COMPREHENSIVE OFFERINGS THAT

00:52:48.732 --> 00:52:49.833
THEY ARE PLANNING FOR THEIR

00:52:49.900 --> 00:52:51.134
MIDDLE SCHOOL STUDENTS. THE

00:52:51.201 --> 00:52:53.036
HIGH SCHOOL AND PIECE OF THIS

00:52:53.103 --> 00:52:54.237
HAS BEEN HARDER BECAUSE OF THE

00:52:54.304 --> 00:52:55.739
TRANSMISSION RATE DIFFERENCES

00:52:55.805 --> 00:52:56.907
BETWEEN OLDER STUDENTS AND

00:52:56.973 --> 00:52:58.241
YOUNGER STUDENTS AND THAT IS

00:52:58.308 --> 00:53:01.211
WHY. WE DID NOT SET A MINIMUM

00:53:01.278 --> 00:53:02.279
FOR THAT WAS HIGHER FOR HIGH

00:53:02.345 --> 00:53:03.146
SCHOOL STUDENTS IN THIS

00:53:03.213 --> 00:53:04.848
LEGISLATION SO THEN AND IS IT

00:53:04.915 --> 00:53:06.249
LIKELY THAT OUR HIGH SCHOOL AND

00:53:06.316 --> 00:53:07.250
JUNIOR HIGH STUDENTS ARE GOING

00:53:07.317 --> 00:53:10.654
TO RETURN TO IN PERSON LEARNING

00:53:10.720 --> 00:53:11.254
UNTIL FALL. I THINK THAT THAT

00:53:11.321 --> 00:53:12.956
IS. A THIS POINT GOING CONTINUE

00:53:13.023 --> 00:53:14.057
TO BE A LOCAL DISCUSSION AND

00:53:14.124 --> 00:53:17.494
DETERMINATION. SO ONE OF MY

00:53:17.561 --> 00:53:21.631

IMMEDIATELY AND CONTINUOUSLY.

01:03:44.487 --> 01:03:45.655
AND THEN FURTHER- THE ONLY

01:03:45.721 --> 01:03:46.756
OTHER REQUIREMENT IN THE PURPLE

01:03:46.822 --> 01:03:48.691
TEAR IS AROUND TWO TO THREE

01:03:48.758 --> 01:03:50.960
TWO. I WITH THE INCREDIBLY HIGH

01:03:51.027 --> 01:03:53.029
TESTING- CADENCES THAT THE

OF STUDENTS THE YOUNGER

01:03:58.868 --> 01:03:59.936
STUDENTS WERE THE LEAST LIKELY

01:04:00.002 --> 01:04:01.604

01:04:27.230 --> 01:04:30.333
LEARNING LOS- BY RELATING JUST

01:04:30.399 --> 01:04:33.069
THE STORY OF ONE YOUNG MAN-

01:04:33.135 --> 01:04:34.971
THAT I HOPE I THINK WE'LL BRING

01:04:35.037 --> 01:04:36.706
THIS ISSUE ALIVE IF AS I THINK

01:04:36.772 --> 01:04:38.574
OF ALL THE BIG STATISTICS OUT

01:04:38.641 --> 01:04:43.846
THERE- THERE IS ON- LATINO BOY.

01:04:43.913 --> 01:04:47.717
VERY BRIGHT FOURTH GRADER- WAS

01:04:47.783 --> 01:04:49.518
ONE OF THE BEST STUDENTS IN HIS

01:04:49.585 --> 01:04:51.354
CLASS IN TERMS OF MASS WAS

01:04:51.420 --> 01:04:53.089
METICULOUS ON TOP OF EVERYTHING

01:04:53.155 --> 01:04:56.158
SCHOOL WORKED WELL FOR ONE WHEN

01:04:56.225 --> 01:04:58.327
HE WAS IN SCHOOL BUT ONCE HOME

01:04:58.394 --> 01:05:01.030
SITUATION IS SUCH THAT HE DOES

01:05:01.097 --> 01:05:04.734
NOT HAVE SUPPORT AT HOME AND AS

01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:06.602
COVERT HERE. ONE STARTED

01:05:06.669 --> 01:05:08.537
FALLING BEHIND STARTED NOT

01:05:08.604 --> 01:05:10.006
GETTING GONE DIDN'T HAVE

01:05:10.072 --> 01:05:12.308
SUPPORT WHEN HIS WIFE I DIDN'T

01:05:12.375 --> 01:05:17.079
WORK- AND FOR. GRADUALLY FROM

01:05:17.146 --> 01:05:18.681
THE SYSTEM AND AS ONE FADED

01:05:18.748 --> 01:05:20.916
FROM THE SYSTEM HE FELL BEHIND

01:05:20.983 --> 01:05:23.919
IN MATH. AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT

01:05:23.986 --> 01:05:25.254
THE LEARNING LOSS IT'S BEEN

01:05:25.321 --> 01:05:27.857
REFERRED TO BY. ALL OF MY

01:05:27.923 --> 01:05:29.759
COLLEAGUES HERE I JUST WANT TO

01:05:29.825 --> 01:05:32.061
BRING THAT ONE HOME IF I FALL

01:05:32.128 --> 01:05:34.130
BEHIND IN READING IT'S EASIER

01:05:34.196 --> 01:05:36.565
TO CATCH UP. BUT IF YOU FALL

01:05:36.632 --> 01:05:38.567
BEHIND IN MATH PRETTY SOON YOU

01:05:38.634 --> 01:05:39.969
THINK YOU'RE NOT GOOD AT MATH

01:05:40.036 --> 01:05:41.337
AND THE MINUTE YOU THINK YOU'RE

01:05:41.404 --> 01:05:42.938
NOT GOOD AT MATH YOU'RE NOT

01:05:43.005 --> 01:05:44.373
GOOD AT MATH. BECAUSE YOU'RE

01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:45.975
NOT WILLING TO TAKE THAT THAT

01:05:46.042 --> 01:05:48.577
THAT NEXT STEP AND I'M SEEING

01:05:48.644 --> 01:05:52.515
THAT IN ONE AND TRYING- TO SEE.

01:05:52.581 --> 01:05:54.984
IF WOULD WE DEAL WITH LEARNING

01:05:55.051 --> 01:05:57.053
LOSS WE HAVE TO REALIZE SOME OF

01:05:57.119 --> 01:06:00.156
THIS WILL BE YOUR REVERSIBLE IF

01:06:00.222 --> 01:06:01.857
WE DON'T SPECIFICALLY FOCUS ON

01:06:01.924 --> 01:06:03.492
THINGS LIKE MATH AND MAKING

01:06:03.559 --> 01:06:05.361
SURE WE GET. THOSE STUDENTS

01:06:05.428 --> 01:06:07.363
BACK TO WHERE THEY WERE AT

01:06:07.430 --> 01:06:08.898
LEAST IN THE FOURTH GRADE LEVEL

01:06:08.964 --> 01:06:10.733
SO I WOULD JUST OFFER TO THINGS

01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:13.602
AND THAT IS WHEN WE PRIORITIZE.

01:06:13.669 --> 01:06:15.805
VACCINES FOR TEACHERS WE ARE

01:06:15.871 --> 01:06:19.775
ALSO PRIORITIZING. VACCINES FOR

01:06:19.842 --> 01:06:20.843
ONE. IN THAT'S ONE OF THE WHY I

01:06:20.910 --> 01:06:22.845
HOPE WE DO A GREAT JOB OF THIS

01:06:22.912 --> 01:06:25.715
PRIORITIZATION IN IN THAT AND

01:06:25.781 --> 01:06:28.751
THE OTHER TING IS THAT I. WANT

01:06:28.818 --> 01:06:30.686
TO IMPLORE OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS

01:06:30.753 --> 01:06:32.154
TO TRY TO TAKE THIS LEARNING

01:06:32.221 --> 01:06:34.924
LOS SERIOUSLY AND NOT JUST SET

01:06:34.990 --> 01:06:36.359
UP A WELL WE'VE GOT SUMMER

SCHOOL IF YOU WANT TO COME. BUT

01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:41.063
REALLY TRY TO DIG DOWN AND FIND

01:06:41.130 --> 01:06:43.065
WHAT ARE THE SPECIFIC LOSSES OF

01:06:43.132 --> 01:06:44.500
EACH OF THOSE STUDENTS THAT

01:06:44.567 --> 01:06:45.835
THEY SHOULD PARTICULARLY. MUST

01:06:45.901 --> 01:06:47.903
CATCH UP ON QUICKLY AND I WOULD

01:06:47.970 --> 01:06:50.106
OFFER MATHIS IS PROBABLY IN IN

01:06:50.172 --> 01:06:52.007

VACCINATIONS THAT ARE GONNA

01:08:00.443 --> 01:08:02.311
TAKE PLACE. I ALSO WANT TO SAY

01:08:02.378 --> 01:08:05.281
THAT WE ARE LIVING IN THEM IN

01:08:05.347 --> 01:08:07.016
ALMOST THE A FALSE SENSE OF

SCHOOLS. AND VACCINATE TEACHERS

01:08:14.557 --> 01:08:15.858
WITHOUT LOOKING AT THE HOT

01:08:15.925 --> 01:08:17.793
ZONES IN OUR COMMUNITIES WHERE

01:08:17.860 --> 01:08:18.627
THE STUDENTS AND THOSE KIDS ARE

01:08:18.694 --> 01:08:20.629
COMING FROM. SEVERAL OF US IN

MONTHS. TO DO HOT STONE

01:08:24.633 --> 01:08:26.569
VACCINATION. BECAUSE WHAT IS

01:08:26.635 --> 01:08:27.937
THE POINT OF VACCINATING A

01:08:28.003 --> 01:08:29.038
TEACHER AND RING OPENING

01:08:29.104 --> 01:08:30.406

01:08:36.645 --> 01:08:39.748
A KITCHEN SOMEWHERE WHO DOES

01:08:39.815 --> 01:08:40.716
NOT HAVE ACCESS TO THE VACCINE.

01:08:40.783 --> 01:08:42.117
THOSE FAMILIES ARE STILL

EXPOSING TEACHERS BY DOING THE

01:08:46.655 --> 01:08:49.825
SAME. SO I WOULD JUST IMPLORE

01:08:49.892 --> 01:08:50.526

VACCINE DISTRIBUTION PLAN FOR

01:08:57.066 --> 01:08:58.601
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND

01:08:58.667 --> 01:09:00.202
REALLY THINK ABOUT AN EQUITY

01:09:00.269 --> 01:09:01.170
LENS IT'S BEEN BROUGHT UP A

01:09:01.237 --> 01:09:03.072

01:09:04.773 --> 01:09:07.376
ABSOLUTELY NO CORRELATION RIGHT

01:09:07.443 --> 01:09:09.245
NOW. IN TERMS OF HOW WE ARE

01:09:09.311 --> 01:09:11.881

EXACTLY THAT PURPOSE YOU JUST

01:11:51.306 --> 01:11:52.775
EXPRESSED A SEMI MEMBER IT IS

01:11:52.841 --> 01:11:54.109
INTENDED. TO ALLOW THOSE

01:11:54.176 --> 01:11:56.945
ELEAZAR WHO ARE NOT ABLE TO

01:11:57.012 --> 01:11:58.781
MEET THE STRICT REQUIREMENTS OF

01:11:58.847 --> 01:12:01.183
MARCH THIRTY FIRST BUT DO YOU

01:12:01.250 --> 01:12:03.018
IN GOOD FAITH ADOPT A RE

01:12:03.085 --> 01:12:05.421
OPENING DATE BETWEEN MARCH

01:12:05.487 --> 01:12:07.122
THIRTY FIRST AND MAY FIFTEENTH.

01:12:07.189 --> 01:12:08.691
TO ALLOW THEM TO HAVE A PORTION

01:12:08.757 --> 01:12:10.192
OF THAT FUNDING TO ACCOMMODATE

01:12:10.259 --> 01:12:12.995
THE EXPENSES THEY WILL HAVE FOR

01:12:13.062 --> 01:12:15.731
SAFELY RE OPENING. MR IF I MAY.

01:12:15.798 --> 01:12:17.066
AND WE BELIEVE THAT THAT TIME

01:12:17.132 --> 01:12:18.567
FRAME IS ENOUGH AN ADEQUATE

01:12:18.634 --> 01:12:20.469
TIME FOR ALLEY ACE TO BE ABLE

01:12:20.536 --> 01:12:23.005
TO COMPLY. WITH THE PLAN THAT

01:12:23.072 --> 01:12:25.541
IS ACCEPTABLE- FOR TO CONTINUE

01:12:25.607 --> 01:12:28.343
THE GRANT- FUNDING TO CONTINUE

01:12:28.410 --> 01:12:30.612
TO MOVE FORWARD TO ALLIE X. WE

01:12:30.679 --> 01:12:32.281
DO. THANK YOU AND THEN JUST ONE

01:12:32.347 --> 01:12:33.816
MORE QUESTION ON THE TWO YEARS

01:12:33.882 --> 01:12:35.217
WITH THE COUNTIES- IF THE

01:12:35.284 --> 01:12:37.619
COUNTY DOES SLIP. BACK INTO THE

01:12:37.686 --> 01:12:39.722
HIGHER TIER. DOES THAT MEAN

01:12:39.788 --> 01:12:41.023
THAT LOCAL ALLEY AS THAT WOULD

01:12:41.090 --> 01:12:42.191
HAVE TO ADJUST AND THERE COULD

01:12:42.257 --> 01:12:44.159
BE A COMPONENT OF OPENING AND

01:12:44.226 --> 01:12:45.394
CLOSING. WITHIN THE SCHOOLS

01:12:45.461 --> 01:12:48.263
ITSELF BASED ON THAT TIER OF

01:12:48.330 --> 01:12:48.997
THE COUNTIES. SO THE WAY THAT

01:12:49.064 --> 01:12:50.199
IT WORKS UNDER CURRENT PUBLIC

01:12:50.265 --> 01:12:51.366
HEALTH GUIDANCE THAT SCHOOL

01:12:51.433 --> 01:12:53.168
DISTRICTS THAT HAVE SAFELY RE

01:12:53.235 --> 01:12:55.137
OPENED WITHIN A WITHIN ADOPTED

01:12:55.204 --> 01:12:56.805
PLAN AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. THAT

01:12:56.872 --> 01:12:58.674
WOULD CONTINUE TO BE A GUIDING

01:12:58.741 --> 01:13:01.443
THEIR OPENING AND CLOSING.

01:13:01.510 --> 01:13:02.511
DECISION MAKING AND THEY'RE

01:13:02.578 --> 01:13:03.946
TESTING THEIR DISTANCE SAYING

01:13:04.012 --> 01:13:05.280
ALL OF THESE REQUIREMENTS WOULD

01:13:05.347 --> 01:13:07.716
BE. GRANDFATHERED IN SO IF THEY

01:13:07.783 --> 01:13:10.452
WERE TO HAVE. LET'S SAY-

01:13:10.519 --> 01:13:12.788
SLIPPED FROM THE RED TEAR BACK

01:13:12.855 --> 01:13:14.523
INTO THE PURPLE TEAR AT ANY

01:13:14.590 --> 01:13:16.458
POINT. THEY ARE- SUPPOSED TO

01:13:16.525 --> 01:13:17.860
PROVIDE CONTINUE TO PROVIDE

01:13:17.926 --> 01:13:19.528
CONTINUOUS INSTRUCTION TO THEIR

01:13:19.595 --> 01:13:21.897
STUDENTS- UNTIL THEY HAVE BEEN

01:13:21.964 --> 01:13:23.665
ORDERED TO BE CLOSED BECAUSE OF

01:13:23.732 --> 01:13:26.034
PUBLIC HEALTH. SO WHAT YOU WILL

01:13:26.101 --> 01:13:27.803
SEE IS IF FOR EXAMPLE THEY WERE

01:13:27.870 --> 01:13:28.937
IN THE RED TEAR AT THE WOULD

01:13:29.004 --> 01:13:30.405
HAVE BEEN OPERATING UNDER THEIR

01:13:30.472 --> 01:13:32.641
RED TIER REQUIREMENTS. IF THEY

01:13:32.708 --> 01:13:33.375
SLIPPED BACK INTO THE PURPLE

01:13:33.442 --> 01:13:35.577
TEAR. THEY WOULD THEN SHIFT TO

01:13:35.644 --> 01:13:37.713
THEIR LOCAL PLANTS PURPLE TIER

01:13:37.780 --> 01:13:40.282
REQUIREMENTS. FOR THOSE ELEAZAR

01:13:40.349 --> 01:13:42.518
WHO HAVE NOT ADOPTED A PURPLE

01:13:42.584 --> 01:13:45.721
TEAR PLAN BY MARCH THIRTY FIRST

01:13:45.788 --> 01:13:48.023
THE DEFAULT WILL BE THE STATE'S

01:13:48.090 --> 01:13:49.691
PURPLE. REQUIREMENTS AND SO

01:13:49.758 --> 01:13:51.293
THEREFORE IF THEY WERE TO HAVE

01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:52.928
SLIPPED FROM RED TEAR. INTO

01:13:52.995 --> 01:13:54.663
PURPLE TEAR THEY WOULD GO BACK

01:13:54.730 --> 01:13:56.431
INTO THOSE REQUIREMENTS BUT- IT

01:13:56.498 --> 01:13:57.966
ALSO IS VERY CLEAR THE

01:13:58.033 --> 01:13:59.902
LEGISLATION. THAT THE INTENT IS

01:13:59.968 --> 01:14:01.170
FOR CONTINUOUS STUDENT

01:14:01.236 --> 01:14:02.871
INSTRUCTIONS SO ONCE AN ALLEY

01:14:02.938 --> 01:14:04.940
A- HAS DETERMINED HOW TO SAFELY

01:14:05.007 --> 01:14:06.642
RE OPEN. AND STARTED OFFERING

01:14:06.708 --> 01:14:08.510
IN PERSON INSTRUCTION TO THOSE

01:14:08.577 --> 01:14:09.912
STUDENTS TO THOSE CHILDREN.

01:14:09.978 --> 01:14:11.413
THEY ARE INTENDED TO DO SO

01:14:11.480 --> 01:14:12.981
UNTIL PUBLIC HEALTH ORDERS THEM

01:14:13.048 --> 01:14:14.716
TO BE CLOSED. THERE ARE CURRENT

01:14:14.783 --> 01:14:16.084
PROGRAM ENTERS IN THE GUIDANCE

01:14:16.151 --> 01:14:17.786
FOR WHEN THEY DO NEED TO CLOSE.

01:14:17.853 --> 01:14:18.954
BASED OFF OF AN INDIVIDUAL

01:14:19.021 --> 01:14:20.856
SCHOOL SITES SPREAD INFECTION

01:14:20.923 --> 01:14:25.360
LEVEL. AS WELL. AS AROUND

01:14:25.427 --> 01:14:30.065

I. I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS I

01:14:37.472 --> 01:14:42.077
JUST I JUST HAD A QUESTION- IS

01:14:42.144 --> 01:14:43.078
WE'RE TRYING TO GET BACK TO IN

01:14:43.145 --> 01:14:45.914
PERSON LEARNING. IS THERE ARE

01:14:45.981 --> 01:14:47.349
THERE ANY REQUIREMENTS ON WHAT

01:14:47.416 --> 01:14:49.051
THAT LOOKS LIKE COULD BE AN

01:14:49.117 --> 01:14:51.320
HOUR A DAY OR IS IT A FULL DAY

01:14:51.386 --> 01:14:53.388
OF LEARNING- IS THAT COMPLETELY

01:14:53.455 --> 01:14:54.556
AT THE DISCRETION OF DISTRICTS

01:14:54.623 --> 01:14:57.092
SO. COULD THEY ARE TECHNICALLY

01:14:57.159 --> 01:14:57.659
OPEN FOR AN HOUR AND RECEIVE

01:14:57.726 --> 01:15:03.699
THIS FUNDING- I JUST YEAH IS IT

01:15:03.765 --> 01:15:04.566
IS BECAUSE I DON'T FEEL LIKE

01:15:04.633 --> 01:15:06.401
THAT'S REALLY OUR INTENT BUT

01:15:06.468 --> 01:15:08.303
BUT I DON'T KNOW I MEAN COULD

01:15:08.370 --> 01:15:10.539
THEY DO THAT. THE BILLS AS

01:15:10.606 --> 01:15:11.874
CURRENTLY WRITTEN ONCE AGAIN AS

01:15:11.940 --> 01:15:13.675
A MINIMUM STANDARD DOES NOT SET

01:15:13.742 --> 01:15:15.143
A MINIMUM STANDARD FOR THE

01:15:15.210 --> 01:15:16.411
NUMBER OF IN PERSON

01:15:16.478 --> 01:15:17.813
INSTRUCTIONAL MINUTES OR IN

01:15:17.880 --> 01:15:21.350
PERSON. A SERVICES SO THAT

01:15:21.416 --> 01:15:24.019
WOULD BE A LOCAL DECISION. OKAY

01:15:24.086 --> 01:15:26.555
SO I DID HEAR FROM- ASSEMBLY

01:15:26.622 --> 01:15:28.657
MEMBER MADONNA DONNA FROM- ARE

01:15:28.724 --> 01:15:29.858
CALLING FROM A LONG BEACH THESE

01:15:29.925 --> 01:15:32.728
ME- AND HE TALKED ABOUT SUMMER

01:15:32.794 --> 01:15:36.064
SCHOOL- AND- BUT I DON'T SEE

01:15:36.131 --> 01:15:36.832
ANYTHING IN THERE REALLY

01:15:36.899 --> 01:15:37.699
ENCOURAGING SUMMER SCHOOL SO

01:15:37.766 --> 01:15:38.867
THAT'S ALL GOING TO BE

01:15:38.934 --> 01:15:41.003
COMPLETELY AT THE DISCRETION OF

01:15:41.069 --> 01:15:41.603
LOCAL DISTRICTS AS WELL OR DID

01:15:41.670 --> 01:15:44.439
I MISS SOMETHING. SEVEN PM

01:15:44.506 --> 01:15:46.008
LANGUAGE AROUND THE LEARNING

01:15:46.074 --> 01:15:48.210
RECOVERY IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM

01:15:48.277 --> 01:15:49.978
THE LANGUAGE THAT YOU ADOPTED

01:15:50.045 --> 01:15:51.213
IN THE BUDGET ACTOR

01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:52.814
INSTRUCTIONAL TIME. SO WE HAVE

01:15:52.881 --> 01:15:54.483
A MINIMUM INSTRUCTIONAL MINUTES

01:15:54.549 --> 01:15:57.552
PERIOD IN THE EDUCATION CODE-

01:15:57.619 --> 01:15:58.820
AND SPECIFIC TO IN DISTANCE

01:15:58.887 --> 01:15:59.988
LEARNING RIGHT NOW WHICH IS

01:16:00.055 --> 01:16:01.189
EQUIVALENT ROUGHLY TO A MINIMUM

01:16:01.256 --> 01:16:03.825
DAY. FOR ANY INDIVIDUAL SCHOOL

01:16:03.892 --> 01:16:06.094
SO THOSE MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR

01:16:06.161 --> 01:16:07.663
INSTRUCTIONAL TIME WHETHER IN

01:16:07.729 --> 01:16:09.564
DISTANCE LEARNING OR IN PERSON

01:16:09.631 --> 01:16:11.099
WOULD REMAIN IN PLACE BUT IT

01:16:11.166 --> 01:16:13.101
WOULD BE A LOCAL DISCRETION. AS

01:16:13.168 --> 01:16:15.203
TO WHICH COMBINATION OF EACH TO

01:16:15.270 --> 01:16:16.338
ACHIEVE THE IN PERSON

01:16:16.405 --> 01:16:18.840
INSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS IN SB

01:16:18.907 --> 01:16:20.475
EIGHTY SIX. SPECIFIC TO THE

01:16:20.542 --> 01:16:22.411
LEARNING RECOVERY FUNDS THOSE

01:16:22.477 --> 01:16:24.279
ARE TO BE A SPECIFICALLY IT

01:16:24.346 --> 01:16:24.780
CALLS OUT OF THOSE ARE

01:16:24.846 --> 01:16:27.215
SUPPLEMENTARY TO THE

01:16:27.282 --> 01:16:29.584
INSTRUCTIONAL MINUTES. SO THERE

01:16:29.651 --> 01:16:31.420
ARE SOME EXCEPTIONS TO THAT

01:16:31.486 --> 01:16:33.622
LIKE ONE ON ONE TUTORING OR

01:16:33.689 --> 01:16:34.990
SMALL GROUP PULLOUT. WHERE YOU

01:16:35.057 --> 01:16:36.458
COULD SEE A STUDENTS LEARNING

01:16:36.525 --> 01:16:38.126
RECOVERY PLANNING DURING THEIR

01:16:38.193 --> 01:16:39.161
INSTRUCTIONAL TIME WHERE

01:16:39.227 --> 01:16:40.462
THEY'RE GETTING SOMETHING.

01:16:40.529 --> 01:16:41.697
DIFFERENT IN SIGNIFICANT

01:16:41.763 --> 01:16:43.765
INTENSIVE BUT THE INTENT

01:16:43.832 --> 01:16:46.301
OVERALL IS THAT IF IT IS. AFTER

01:16:46.368 --> 01:16:48.370
SCHOOL BEFORE SCHOOL SUMMER

01:16:48.437 --> 01:16:49.771
SCHOOL THE OUR INTENSIVE

01:16:49.838 --> 01:16:52.874
SUPPORTS THAT ARE ABOVE AND

01:16:52.941 --> 01:16:53.608
BEYOND THE INSTRUCTIONAL DAY.

01:16:53.675 --> 01:16:54.476
SO AND THEN I GUESS MY FINAL

01:16:54.543 --> 01:16:55.310
QUESTION DO WE HAVE ANY

01:16:55.377 --> 01:16:58.413
INDICATION OF. HOW MANY SCHOOLS

01:16:58.480 --> 01:17:00.015
WILL ACTUALLY TRY TO TAKE

01:17:00.082 --> 01:17:01.516
ADVANTAGE OF THAT- IN THE

01:17:01.583 --> 01:17:03.952
INTERESTS OF. HELPING STUDENTS

01:17:04.019 --> 01:17:06.388
RECOVER. I THINK THAT IT'S FAIR

01:17:06.455 --> 01:17:07.389
TO SAY THAT THE LEARNING

01:17:07.456 --> 01:17:08.824
RECOVERY PART OF THIS BILL HAS

01:17:08.890 --> 01:17:10.726
BEEN UNIVERSALLY APPRECIATED BY

01:17:10.792 --> 01:17:11.994
EDUCATION LEADERS ACROSS THE

01:17:12.060 --> 01:17:14.997
STATE- THE EDUCATORS MANAGEMENT

01:17:15.063 --> 01:17:18.400
FOLKS ARE VERY- EAGER TO START.

01:17:18.467 --> 01:17:20.168
LAYING A PATH FORWARD FOR IN

01:17:20.235 --> 01:17:22.804
PERSON SUPPLEMENTARY LEARNING

01:17:22.871 --> 01:17:25.474
RECOVERY EFFORTS. AND TEACHERS

01:17:25.540 --> 01:17:27.309
HAVE AS WELL AS USE OF OKAY.

01:17:27.376 --> 01:17:32.147
OKAY THANK YOU. IT AND IT JUST

01:17:32.214 --> 01:17:32.647
IT JUST OF BIRTH FOR THE

01:17:32.714 --> 01:17:34.082
CLARIFY THE WAY THE FOUR POINT

01:17:34.149 --> 01:17:36.084
SIX BILLION. IN LEARNING

01:17:36.151 --> 01:17:39.955
COVERING WAS STRUCTURED- 85% OF

01:17:40.022 --> 01:17:43.225
IT HAS TO BE USED FOR IN PERSON

01:17:43.291 --> 01:17:45.160
INSTRUCTION. SO WHAT THEY CAN

01:17:45.227 --> 01:17:47.929
DO SOME LEVEL OF ONLINE OR

01:17:47.996 --> 01:17:49.664
DISTANCE LEARNING- THE BALL

01:17:49.731 --> 01:17:52.601
BECAUSE IT REALLY HAS TO BE

01:17:52.667 --> 01:17:53.535
USED FOR IN PERSON. MISTER

01:17:53.602 --> 01:17:56.638
JONES SAWYER. AND I JUST WANNA

IN THE MIDDLE SCHOOL. THAT

01:19:00.168 --> 01:19:02.270
COULD BE DEVASTATING FOR THE

01:19:02.337 --> 01:19:03.572
REST OF YOUR LIFE AND SO THAT'S

01:19:03.638 --> 01:19:05.740
WHY LEARNING LOSS IS SO

01:19:05.807 --> 01:19:07.509
IMPORTANT SPACE FOR AFRICAN

01:19:07.576 --> 01:19:09.911
AMERICAN LATINO STUDENTS.

HAPPEN WITH OUR MOST PRECIOUS

01:19:55.423 --> 01:19:59.161
CARGO WHICH IS OUR KIDS. THAT

01:19:59.227 --> 01:20:00.028
ISRAEL DISADVANTAGED

RUNNING. BUT WE'RE TRAPPED

01:20:13.675 --> 01:20:16.611
HERE- NOT PROVIDING ENOUGH

01:20:16.678 --> 01:20:19.748
RESOURCES. BUT MOST IMPORTANT

01:20:19.814 --> 01:20:21.183
IF THEY'RE NOT PUT TO THE FRONT.

01:20:21.249 --> 01:20:24.686

ABOUT IT WE WERE ALREADY BEHIND.

01:21:07.195 --> 01:21:09.097
IF WE DON'T DO ANYTHING NOW WE

01:21:09.164 --> 01:21:10.665
COULD LOSE GENERATIONS AND

01:21:10.732 --> 01:21:13.702
GENERATIONS TO POVERTY. AND

01:21:13.768 --> 01:21:15.403
THINGS THAT WE THOUGHT WE WERE

BUT ABOUT HALF OF MY

01:21:40.462 --> 01:21:44.699
CONSTITUENTS- OF ACCESO UNIFIED

01:21:44.766 --> 01:21:48.637
SCHOOL DISTRICT THE- FOR THEIR-

01:21:48.703 --> 01:21:51.072
CHILDREN. I AND I WANT TO JOIN

01:21:51.139 --> 01:21:53.241
MIKE WHO SPOKE SO L. ABOUT THE-

01:21:53.308 --> 01:21:56.511
IMPORTANCE OF- OF MAKING

01:21:56.578 --> 01:21:59.447
CERTAIN THAT WE DO NOT ALLOW

01:21:59.514 --> 01:22:01.850
CHILDREN TO FALL FURTHER BEHIND

01:22:01.916 --> 01:22:04.419
SIMPLY BECAUSE- OF WHERE THEY

01:22:04.486 --> 01:22:06.254
LIVE OR THE COLOR OF THEIR

01:22:06.321 --> 01:22:08.890
SKIN- OR ANY OF THE OTHER

01:22:08.957 --> 01:22:11.226
EQUITY FACTORS- THAT ARE IN. IN

01:22:11.293 --> 01:22:13.428
PLAY HERE WE SIMPLY CAN'T DO

01:22:13.495 --> 01:22:17.432
THAT LEASE- SUFFERS A SOCIETY-

01:22:17.499 --> 01:22:20.935
AND AS INDIVIDUALS. THE FURTHER

01:22:21.002 --> 01:22:23.705
THAT DIVIDE GROWS- IT'S

01:22:23.772 --> 01:22:25.206
REFLECTED IN FISHERS IN OUR

01:22:25.273 --> 01:22:30.779
SOCIETY- AND- IT WOULD BE

01:22:30.845 --> 01:22:33.148
OUTRAGEOUS IF THE ACTION THAT

01:22:33.214 --> 01:22:36.151
WE TAKE HERE TODAY- WERE TO

01:22:36.217 --> 01:22:38.586
FURTHER EXACERBATE THAT- I KNOW

01:22:38.653 --> 01:22:40.622
THAT NONE OF US WANT TO SEE

01:22:40.689 --> 01:22:43.358
THAT HAPPEN CERTAINLY NOT TO

01:22:43.425 --> 01:22:45.827

SUPPORTING. OF THIS BILL TODAY

01:22:51.366 --> 01:22:53.535
IS A STEP FORWARD- BUT I THINK

01:22:53.601 --> 01:22:55.770
IT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THAT

01:22:55.837 --> 01:22:58.239
WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR ITS

01:22:58.306 --> 01:23:00.742
IMPLEMENTATION. I THINK A LOT

01:23:00.809 --> 01:23:03.378
OF THE- PARENTS WHO ARE

01:23:03.445 --> 01:23:06.047
FOLLOWING THIS DEBATE- I THINK

01:23:06.114 --> 01:23:09.284
THAT WE ARE. JUST YOU KNOW HERE

01:23:09.351 --> 01:23:12.153

01:23:12.220 --> 01:23:13.988
WE SHOULD FLIP A SWITCH AND

01:23:14.055 --> 01:23:15.657
THAT SHOULD HAPPEN AND THAT

01:23:15.724 --> 01:23:17.792
CLEARLY IS NOT WHAT'S HAPPENING

01:23:17.859 --> 01:23:20.428

01:23:32.874 --> 01:23:35.977
WE ARE- CURRENTLY TALKING ABOUT

01:23:36.044 --> 01:23:40.315
ONLY A FRACTION OF STUDENTS.

01:23:40.382 --> 01:23:42.250

FOR LOCAL SCHOOLS AGO

01:25:05.133 --> 01:25:06.935
OBVIOUSLY- SENIOR OWN DISTRO

01:25:07.001 --> 01:25:07.936
THERE ARE MANY THAT ARE MUCH

01:25:08.002 --> 01:25:09.671
MORE PROGRESSIVE THAN THIS

01:25:15.410 --> 01:25:17.378
WHO HAVE NOT MADE PROGRESS

01:25:17.445 --> 01:25:19.147
TOWARDS EVEN A MINIMUM PHASE

01:25:19.214 --> 01:25:20.982

PERSON AND ONLINE INSTRUCTION

01:28:06.214 --> 01:28:07.849

THROUGH THE SPRING. OKAY AND

01:28:10.385 --> 01:28:12.353
THEN- MAYBE YOU CAN CLARIFY I

01:28:12.420 --> 01:28:14.822
KNOW THE LIGHT- MY PUBLIC

THAT- TESTING CADENCE AND WHAT

ALLOWED SO IF YOU HAVE A SCHOOL

01:28:27.835 --> 01:28:30.905
DISTRICT IS- MOVING FORWARD

01:28:30.972 --> 01:28:32.840
WITH THEIR PLAN- ALREADY THEN

01:28:32.907 --> 01:28:33.641
THEY WOULD THEN BE

01:28:33.708 --> 01:28:35.376
GRANDFATHERED IN AND WOULD HAVE

01:28:35.443 --> 01:28:37.578
A TESTING CADENCE OF. ONCE

01:28:37.645 --> 01:28:39.380
EVERY TWO MONTHS AND THEN IT

01:28:39.447 --> 01:28:43.851
BUT IF THEY WORD TO- AND NOT IN

01:28:43.918 --> 01:28:45.586
AN OPEN UNDER THESE NEW

01:28:45.653 --> 01:28:48.656
GUIDANCE IS- AT BEFORE APRIL

01:28:48.723 --> 01:28:51.793
FIRST- THEN IF THERE IT DEPENDS

01:28:51.859 --> 01:28:53.261
ON THEIR TEARS OF THEIR IN THE

01:28:53.327 --> 01:28:56.164
RED HERE THEY WE TEST. EVERY

01:28:56.230 --> 01:28:58.366

01:28:58.433 --> 01:28:59.400
THAT AND THE RED IT HAS EVERY

01:28:59.467 --> 01:29:00.802
TWO WEEKS AND IF THEY'RE IN THE

01:29:00.868 --> 01:29:02.303
PURPLE THEY WOULD TEST EVERY.

01:29:02.370 --> 01:29:04.605
WEEK IS THAT CORRECT. SO THAT'S

01:29:04.672 --> 01:29:05.840
THE ONLY- TO CORRECT ME IF I

01:29:05.907 --> 01:29:08.242

NEED TO REPORT INTO THEIR

01:29:27.762 --> 01:29:30.431
