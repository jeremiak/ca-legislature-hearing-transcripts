SCIENCE JUST A FEW YEARS AGO

00:31:45.670 --> 00:31:47.572
THEY THOUGHT IT WAS ONLY SEVEN

00:31:47.639 --> 00:31:48.106
HUNDRED NEURAL CONNECTIONS

00:31:48.172 --> 00:31:50.808
EVERY SECOND. AND THAT

00:31:50.875 --> 00:31:52.210
DEVELOPMENTS THAT FOUNDATIONS

00:31:52.277 --> 00:31:52.977
FOR HOW FAR KIDS WILL

00:31:53.044 --> 00:31:55.213
ULTIMATELY GO IN SCHOOL WHAT

00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:55.813
THEY ARE AND AS ADULTS AND HOW

00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:56.648
HEALTHY THEY ARE OVER THEIR

00:31:56.714 --> 00:31:59.050
LIFETIMES. THIS DEVELOPMENT IS

00:31:59.117 --> 00:32:00.618
FUELED BY RELATIONSHIPS WITH

00:32:00.685 --> 00:32:02.153
CARING ADULTS WHO SUPPORT THEIR

00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:04.956
GROWTH AND LEARNING. AS IT'S

00:32:05.023 --> 00:32:07.525
EVER CHANGING ACROSS MOTOR

00:32:07.592 --> 00:32:08.126
COGNITIVE SOCIAL AND LANGUAGE

00:32:08.192 --> 00:32:08.693
DOMAINS AND THOSE ARE THE S.

00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:11.462
YEARS. THIS RAPID DEVELOPMENT

00:32:11.529 --> 00:32:12.530
CAN REALLY LEAVE PARENTS WITH

00:32:12.597 --> 00:32:14.699
MANY QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS AND

00:32:14.766 --> 00:32:16.100
IT CAN ALSO MASK MISSED

00:32:16.167 --> 00:32:18.369
MILESTONES IN ONE OR MORE AREAS

00:32:18.436 --> 00:32:19.537
ALTHOUGH MOST CHILDREN PROGRESS

00:32:19.604 --> 00:32:21.706
ALONG DEVELOPMENTS IN. TIMELY

00:32:21.773 --> 00:32:23.041
AND PREDICTABLE PATTERNS NOT

00:32:23.107 --> 00:32:25.276
ALL DO YOU AND AN ESTIMATED

00:32:25.343 --> 00:32:27.278
12215% OF ALL KIDS WILL

00:32:27.345 --> 00:32:27.779
EXPERIENCE SOME FORM OF

00:32:27.845 --> 00:32:30.415
DEVELOPMENTAL DELAY. RESEARCH

00:32:30.481 --> 00:32:31.983
ALSO SHOWS THAT EXPERIENCES OF

00:32:32.050 --> 00:32:33.418
TRAUMA AND CIRCUMSTANCE OF HIS

00:32:33.484 --> 00:32:34.686
OF ADVERSITY DURING THIS

00:32:34.752 --> 00:32:36.220
SENSITIVE PERIOD CAN INCREASE

00:32:36.287 --> 00:32:37.789
CHANCES OF DEVELOPMENTAL DELAYS

00:32:37.855 --> 00:32:39.357
IN FACT IT'S THE MOST COMMON

00:32:39.424 --> 00:32:41.793
MANIFESTATION OF ADVERSE

00:32:41.859 --> 00:32:42.293
CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES OF

00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:44.462
LEARNING A BEHAVIOR TROUBLES.

00:32:44.529 --> 00:32:45.730
THE STAKES IN CALIFORNIA ARE

00:32:45.797 --> 00:32:47.265
HIGH BECAUSE THE SHEER NUMBER

00:32:47.332 --> 00:32:49.734
OF INFANTS AND TODDLERS WE HAVE

00:32:49.801 --> 00:32:50.802
THERE ARE TWO MILLION CHILDREN

00:32:50.868 --> 00:32:52.170
UNDER THREE YEARS OLD IN

00:32:52.236 --> 00:32:53.905
CALIFORNIA THEY ARE MORE LIKELY

00:32:53.971 --> 00:32:55.306
TO BE LOW INCOME THAN OTHER AGE

00:32:55.373 --> 00:32:57.075
GROUPS THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO

00:32:57.141 --> 00:32:57.942
SPEAK A LANGUAGE OTHER THAN

00:32:58.009 --> 00:32:59.143
ENGLISH AT HOME. THEY ARE MORE

00:32:59.210 --> 00:33:02.947
LIKELY. TO BE ISOLATED FROM THE

00:33:03.014 --> 00:33:04.215
SYSTEM IS MEANT TO SERVE THEM

00:33:04.282 --> 00:33:06.284
BECAUSE PARENTS ARE YOUNG AND

00:33:06.351 --> 00:33:07.151
HAVEN'T HAD AS MUCH EXPERIENCE

00:33:07.218 --> 00:33:09.253
WITH GOVERNMENTS. RESEARCH

00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:10.588
SHOWS THAT RACE AN INCOME BASED

00:33:10.655 --> 00:33:12.423
DISPARITIES AN ACHIEVEMENT

00:33:12.490 --> 00:33:13.725
OPPORTUNITY OPEN VERY EARLY IN

00:33:13.791 --> 00:33:15.660
CHILDREN'S LIVES. AND ONCE

00:33:15.727 --> 00:33:17.095
PRESENT THEIR MORE DIFFICULT TO

00:33:17.161 --> 00:33:18.396
RESOLVE AND MORE LIKELY TO

00:33:18.463 --> 00:33:20.064
PERSIST THROUGH CHILDHOOD AND

00:33:20.131 --> 00:33:21.532
ADULTHOOD BUT THE RIGHT KIND OF

00:33:21.599 --> 00:33:23.701
HELP AT THE RIGHT TIME CAN GO A

00:33:23.768 --> 00:33:25.770
LONG LONG WAY FOR KIDS. I'M

00:33:25.837 --> 00:33:27.071
DESPITE SIGNIFICANT EVIDENCE

00:33:27.138 --> 00:33:28.906
THAT IDENTIFYING DEVELOPMENTAL

00:33:28.973 --> 00:33:29.741
DELAYS AND DISABILITIES AS

00:33:29.807 --> 00:33:32.043
EARLY AS POSSIBLE IS. CREATES

00:33:32.110 --> 00:33:33.478
BETTER OUTCOMES FOR CHILDREN

00:33:33.544 --> 00:33:35.313
AND ACTUALLY REDUCES UNLESS

00:33:35.380 --> 00:33:37.849
PUBLIC COSTS FOR INTERVENTION

00:33:37.915 --> 00:33:38.950
CALIFORNIA IS NOT DOING IT THE

00:33:39.016 --> 00:33:41.452
WAY WE SHOULD BE. LESS THAN

00:33:41.519 --> 00:33:43.321
HALF OF ABOUT 43% OF ALL

00:33:43.388 --> 00:33:45.089

PRIOR TO KINDERGARTEN. AND THIS

00:33:47.992 --> 00:33:49.093
COMES WITH COSTS NOT JUST FOR

00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:51.095
CHILDREN BUT ALSO FOR SCHOOL

00:33:51.162 --> 00:33:52.964

EDUCATION. EARLY IDENTIFICATION

00:33:58.236 --> 00:33:59.537
AND INTERVENTION IS A TWO SIDED

00:33:59.604 --> 00:34:01.973
COIN TO GET CHILDREN THE

00:34:02.039 --> 00:34:03.241
SUPPORTS THEY NEED YOU MUST

00:34:03.307 --> 00:34:03.875
FIRST IDENTIFY THE CHILDREN WHO

00:34:03.941 --> 00:34:06.577
NEED SUPPORT. EXPERTS LIKE THE

00:34:06.644 --> 00:34:08.079
AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS

00:34:08.146 --> 00:34:09.814
RECOMMENDS ROUTINE FORMALIZED

00:34:09.881 --> 00:34:11.015
DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENING FOR ALL

00:34:11.082 --> 00:34:13.551
INFANTS AND TODDLERS AT NINE

00:34:13.618 --> 00:34:14.152
EIGHTEEN AND THIRTY MONTHS OF

00:34:14.218 --> 00:34:16.387
AGE IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY

00:34:16.454 --> 00:34:17.021
TO IDENTIFY WHAT CHILDREN MIGHT

00:34:17.088 --> 00:34:20.224
NEED IN. TERMS OF SUPPORT A

00:34:20.291 --> 00:34:21.859

YOU MAY HAVE FILLED THEM OUT

00:34:22.527 --> 00:34:24.695
FOR YOUR OWN CHILDREN OR FOR

00:34:24.762 --> 00:34:25.763
FAMILY MEMBERS IT'S AN AGE

00:34:25.830 --> 00:34:27.331
SPECIFIC CHECKLIST THAT

00:34:27.398 --> 00:34:28.599
PROVIDES A SNAPSHOT OF WHERE

00:34:28.666 --> 00:34:31.035
KIDS ARE. AND ENABLES PARENTS

00:34:31.102 --> 00:34:32.637
PEDIATRICIANS AND EDUCATORS TO

00:34:32.703 --> 00:34:34.906
IDENTIFY PLACES WHERE A CHILD

00:34:34.972 --> 00:34:35.506
MAY NEED ADDITIONAL ASSESSMENT

00:34:35.573 --> 00:34:38.276

CHILDREN WHO DO NEED ADDITIONAL

00:34:39.644 --> 00:34:40.778
SUPPORT EARLY INTERVENTION IS

00:34:40.845 --> 00:34:43.414
CRITICAL. IT CAN BE INTENSIVE

00:34:43.481 --> 00:34:44.415
SUCH AS INDIVIDUAL SPEECH

00:34:44.482 --> 00:34:46.284

00:34:46.350 --> 00:34:48.085
PHYSICAL THERAPIES OR LESS

00:34:48.152 --> 00:34:50.021

STRATEGIES AT HOME LEARNING

00:34:51.088 --> 00:34:51.989
STRATEGIES THAT PARENTS

00:34:52.056 --> 00:34:53.624
IMPLEMENTED. IT CAN BE JUST

00:34:53.691 --> 00:34:54.992
SOMETHING THAT A CHILD NEEDS

00:34:55.059 --> 00:34:56.861
FOR A SHORT TIME OR SOMETHING

00:34:56.928 --> 00:34:57.462
THAT THEY NEED OVER A LONGER

00:34:57.528 --> 00:34:58.863
PERIOD TO GET THE BOOST THEY

00:34:58.930 --> 00:35:01.399
NEED FOR. MOST IMPORTANTLY

00:35:01.466 --> 00:35:03.501
BECAUSE INFANTS AND TODDLERS

00:35:03.568 --> 00:35:06.270
COME ATTACHED TO FAMILIES. THE

00:35:06.337 --> 00:35:07.538

00:35:07.605 --> 00:35:09.140
VERY EXPLICITLY INTENDED TO

00:35:09.207 --> 00:35:11.742

00:35:36.901 --> 00:35:39.437
THERE'S LOTS OF GAPS FAMILIES

LONG WAITS FOR SERVICES OR A

THAT 12215% OF YOUNG KIDS

00:39:00.337 --> 00:39:02.206
LIKELY ARE EXPERIENCING DELAYS

00:39:02.273 --> 00:39:03.641
AND YOU DO THE MATH AGAINST YOU

00:39:03.708 --> 00:39:04.809
MILLION INFANTS AND TODDLERS

00:39:04.875 --> 00:39:08.813

SCREENING AND FINALLY A

00:40:38.469 --> 00:40:39.336
DIAGNOSIS AND REFERRAL TO

00:40:39.403 --> 00:40:41.372
SERVICES IN CALIFORNIA AND I

00:40:41.438 --> 00:40:42.706
KNOW MANY OTHER PARENTS

00:40:42.773 --> 00:40:43.841
ENCOUNTERED SIMILAR OBSTACLES

00:40:43.908 --> 00:40:45.810
IN THIS PROCESS. WHEN MY

00:40:45.876 --> 00:40:47.311
DAUGHTER AS ONLY TWO I DID

00:40:47.378 --> 00:40:48.946
CONTACT REGIONAL CENTER

00:40:49.013 --> 00:40:50.014
EXPRESSING CONCERN THAT SHE

00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:51.515
STILL WASN'T TALKING SHE

00:40:51.582 --> 00:40:53.350
BOBBLED SAID A FEW WORDS BUT

00:40:53.417 --> 00:40:54.051
WASN'T MEETING THE MILESTONE

00:40:54.118 --> 00:40:56.287
THAT I READ AND ON THE BOOKS.

00:40:56.353 --> 00:40:57.288
AFTER A BRIEF CONVERSATION I

00:40:57.354 --> 00:40:59.323
WAS TOLD THAT BECAUSE SHE COULD

00:40:59.390 --> 00:40:59.924
SAYS WORDS SHE DIDN'T QUALIFY

00:40:59.990 --> 00:41:02.326
FOR SERVICES. I WORK WITH A LOT

00:41:02.393 --> 00:41:03.460
OF CLINICIANS NOT ONE OF THEM

00:41:03.527 --> 00:41:04.261
WOULD CONSIDER MAKING A

00:41:04.328 --> 00:41:06.130
CONCLUSION ABOUT A CHILD NEEDS

00:41:06.197 --> 00:41:08.299
WITHOUT SEEING THEM IN PERSON

00:41:08.365 --> 00:41:08.933
BUT I HAD. A CLOSED DOOR ON THE

00:41:08.999 --> 00:41:11.769
PHONE WITH ONE CALL. EVERY

00:41:11.836 --> 00:41:13.037
PEDIATRICIAN THAT WE SAW DID

00:41:13.103 --> 00:41:13.904
USE A DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENING

00:41:13.971 --> 00:41:15.639
TOOL. BUT THEY ALL GAVE IT TO

00:41:15.706 --> 00:41:16.774
US ON A CLIPBOARD IN THE

00:41:16.841 --> 00:41:18.943
WAITING ROM. NO IN ASSISTED US

00:41:19.009 --> 00:41:19.677
WITH UNDERSTANDING THE

00:41:19.743 --> 00:41:21.445
QUESTIONS INTERPRETING THEM. IF

00:41:21.512 --> 00:41:23.080
I ASKED FOR CLARIFICATION I WAS

00:41:23.147 --> 00:41:26.183
TOLD TO DO THE BEST I COULD. AS

00:41:26.250 --> 00:41:27.885
FIRST TIME PARENTS WE HAD NO

00:41:27.952 --> 00:41:30.387
REFERENCE. FOR WHAT OTHER

00:41:30.454 --> 00:41:32.790
CHILDREN LOOK LIKE HOW THOSE

00:41:32.857 --> 00:41:33.958
SKILLS WERE EXHIBITED IN OTHER

00:41:34.024 --> 00:41:36.927
KIDS. AND WE WANTED HER TO BE

00:41:36.994 --> 00:41:38.896
NORMAL AND SO WE TENDED TO FILL

00:41:38.963 --> 00:41:40.731
THOSE FORMS OUT WITH THAT. BIAS

00:41:40.798 --> 00:41:44.201
CLOUDING OUR JUDGMENT. IT WAS

00:41:44.268 --> 00:41:44.869
OUR DAUGHTER'S PRESCHOOL

00:41:44.935 --> 00:41:47.104
TEACHER WHO FIRST NOTICED SHE

00:41:47.171 --> 00:41:48.339
TOLD IS THIS USING A LACK OF

00:41:48.405 --> 00:41:50.241
SPONTANEOUS LANGUAGE BUT THIS

00:41:50.307 --> 00:41:51.609
WAS QUICKLY FOLLOWED BY

00:41:51.675 --> 00:41:52.109
REASSURANCE THAT IT WAS

00:41:52.176 --> 00:41:54.278
PROBABLY NOTHING. HER

00:41:54.345 --> 00:41:55.679
RECOMMENDATION WAS SIMPLY TO

00:41:55.746 --> 00:41:59.116
NOTE IT AND GIVE IT SIX MONTHS.

00:41:59.183 --> 00:42:01.118
WE FINALLY SAW OUR PEDIATRICIAN

00:42:01.185 --> 00:42:03.320
FOR REFERRAL AND HE ALSO SAID

00:42:03.387 --> 00:42:04.655
IT'S LIKELY NOTHING BUT LET'S

00:42:04.722 --> 00:42:06.390
GET HER A DEVELOPMENTAL

00:42:06.457 --> 00:42:06.991
SCREENING JUST IN CASE AND HE

00:42:07.057 --> 00:42:09.393
REFERRED US TO A CLINIC. MONTHS

00:42:09.460 --> 00:42:11.295
LATER AFTER I HAD PULLED

00:42:11.362 --> 00:42:13.397
RECORDS FOR A PROVIDER I HAPPEN

00:42:13.464 --> 00:42:14.531
TO READ HIS NOTES AND HE

00:42:14.598 --> 00:42:15.633
DESCRIBED HER AS GROSSLY

00:42:15.699 --> 00:42:18.102
DISENGAGED. AT THAT ENCOUNTER.

00:42:18.168 --> 00:42:19.737
I THINK HE KNEW I THINK THE

00:42:19.803 --> 00:42:21.405
TEACHER KNEW. AND I THINK THEY

00:42:21.472 --> 00:42:22.039
WERE AFRAID TO TALK TO ME ABOUT

00:42:22.106 --> 00:42:26.343
IT. AND I MAY HAVE REACTED

00:42:26.410 --> 00:42:27.811
BADLY I AM IT MAY HAVE BEEN AN

00:42:27.878 --> 00:42:30.147
UNPLEASANT TALK CONVERSATION

00:42:30.214 --> 00:42:30.915
BUT I ALSO WOULD HAVE GOTTEN

00:42:30.981 --> 00:42:32.616
SCREAM CENTER SO I THINK IT'S

00:42:32.683 --> 00:42:34.118
IMPORTANT THAT PEOPLE ON THE

00:42:34.184 --> 00:42:35.085
FRONT LINES WORKING WITH YOUNG

00:42:35.152 --> 00:42:37.221
CHILDREN KNOW HOW TO HAVE THESE

00:42:37.288 --> 00:42:37.821
CONVERSATIONS WITH PARENTS AND

00:42:37.888 --> 00:42:38.822
GET SCREENINGS. DONE QUICKER

00:42:38.889 --> 00:42:43.527
QUICKER. SO NOW IN THE MIDST OF

00:42:43.594 --> 00:42:45.629
GRIEF EXHAUSTION AND ESCALATING

00:42:45.696 --> 00:42:48.899
DIFFICULTY WITH MY DAUGHTER. I

00:42:48.966 --> 00:42:50.768
STARTED INTO A CONFUSING

00:42:50.834 --> 00:42:52.403
BUREAUCRATIC TIME CONSUMING

00:42:52.469 --> 00:42:53.570
PROCESS TO GET A FORMAL

00:42:53.637 --> 00:42:54.872
DIAGNOSIS BUT WITH LITTLE

00:42:54.939 --> 00:42:57.908
GUIDANCE OR ASSISTANCE. NOT

00:42:57.975 --> 00:42:59.877
HAVING GUIDANCE MEANT THAT I

00:42:59.944 --> 00:43:00.444
MADE MISSTEPS AND THERE WERE

00:43:00.511 --> 00:43:04.448
DELAYS. TO GIVE YOU A SENSE THE

00:43:04.515 --> 00:43:05.616
INITIAL CONVERSATION WITH HER

00:43:05.683 --> 00:43:06.216
PRESCHOOL TEACHER WAS IN JUNE

00:43:06.283 --> 00:43:09.787
OF TWENTY FIFTEEN. WE SAW THE

00:43:09.853 --> 00:43:11.488
PEDIATRICIAN TO REFER GET

00:43:11.555 --> 00:43:12.289
REFERRAL TO A SCREENING IN

00:43:12.356 --> 00:43:15.426
OCTOBER OF TWENTY FIFTEEN. IT

00:43:15.492 --> 00:43:18.295
WAS ANOTHER SIX MONTHS BEFORE

00:43:18.362 --> 00:43:18.829
WE HAD A DIAGNOSIS FROM A

00:43:18.896 --> 00:43:21.265
PSYCHOLOGIST AT REGIONAL CENTER.

00:43:21.332 --> 00:43:22.733
AND WHEN WE FINALLY RECEIVE THE

00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:23.901
FINAL REPORT FROM REGIONAL

00:43:23.968 --> 00:43:25.002
CENTER THAT OPENED THE DOOR TO

00:43:25.069 --> 00:43:26.270
THE FULL ARRAY OF SERVICES. IT

00:43:26.337 --> 00:43:29.340
WAS NOVEMBER OF TWENTY SIXTEEN.

00:43:29.406 --> 00:43:30.841
SO WELL ALMOST A YEAR AND A

00:43:30.908 --> 00:43:32.343
HALF SINCE WE FIRST STARTED TO

00:43:32.409 --> 00:43:32.876
NOTICE SOMETHING WAS WRONG

00:43:32.943 --> 00:43:35.012
THAT'S FAR TOO LONG. AND BY

00:43:35.079 --> 00:43:35.546
THIS TIME MY DAUGHTER WAS

00:43:35.612 --> 00:43:39.350
ALMOST FOUR. AND SHE DIDN'T

00:43:39.416 --> 00:43:42.286
RECEIVE YEARS OF EARLY

00:43:42.353 --> 00:43:42.820
INTERVENTION SERVICES THAT

00:43:42.886 --> 00:43:43.420
MIGHT HAVE CHANGED THE COURSE

00:43:43.487 --> 00:43:45.689
OF HER DEVELOPMENT. THAT WOULD

00:43:45.756 --> 00:43:47.458
HELP US PROPERLY CARE FOR HER

00:43:47.524 --> 00:43:48.092
AND I BELIEVE WOULD HAVE LED TO

00:43:48.158 --> 00:43:51.662
A BETTER OUTCOME FOR HER. I HAD

00:43:51.729 --> 00:43:52.896
WORKED IN SPECIAL EDUCATION AS

00:43:52.963 --> 00:43:55.532
A PROFESSIONAL. I SPENT FIVE

00:43:55.599 --> 00:43:58.235
YEARS WORKING FOR FIRST FIVE LA.

00:43:58.302 --> 00:43:59.737
I HAVE A COLLEGE DEGREE A GREAT

00:43:59.803 --> 00:44:01.271
JOB AN EXCELLENT HEALTHCARE

00:44:01.338 --> 00:44:03.841
COVERAGE MY MOM WAS A TEACHER I

00:44:03.907 --> 00:44:04.808
HAD SEVERAL FRIENDS WHO WERE

00:44:04.875 --> 00:44:06.910
EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATORS. IF

00:44:06.977 --> 00:44:08.746
ANY PARENT SHOULD HAVE BEEN

00:44:08.812 --> 00:44:10.147
ABLE TO GET THEIR CHILD

AS A FULL BOTTOM IS AND I

00:44:42.946 --> 00:44:44.248
MENTION NATION WHO DRAWS BLOOD

FOR FURTHER ANALYSIS IRON ABOUT

00:44:46.950 --> 00:44:49.453
FORTY THOUSAND ANNUALLY AND-

00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:51.622
THIS IS TOO MUCH TO QUALIFY FOR

00:44:51.688 --> 00:44:52.089
A NUMBER OF GOVERNMENT

00:44:52.156 --> 00:44:54.758
ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS. IT WASN'T

00:44:54.825 --> 00:44:56.627
UNTIL MY YOUNGEST SON WAS

00:44:56.693 --> 00:44:58.962
DIAGNOSED WITH AUTISM AT THE

00:44:59.029 --> 00:44:59.530
AGE TO THAT HE QUALIFIED FOR

00:44:59.596 --> 00:45:02.933
MEDI CAL. AFTER MY CHILDREN

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:04.935
WERE DIAGNOSED I WOULD START

00:45:05.002 --> 00:45:06.070
WANTED TO START SERVICES

00:45:06.136 --> 00:45:07.604
IMMEDIATELY I KNEW EARLY

00:45:07.671 --> 00:45:10.074
INTERVENTION IS THE KEY AND I

00:45:10.140 --> 00:45:10.641
WANTED TO GIVE THEM THE BEST

00:45:10.707 --> 00:45:13.477
POSSIBLE START. I KNEW SERVICES

00:45:13.544 --> 00:45:15.446
WOULD BE EXPENSIVE BUT IT

00:45:15.512 --> 00:45:16.080
DIDN'T I DIDN'T EXPECT IT TO BE

00:45:16.146 --> 00:45:19.316
SO DIFFICULT. TO GET THE

00:45:19.383 --> 00:45:21.218
SERVICES FOR MY CHILDREN THE

00:45:21.285 --> 00:45:24.054
NEEDS THAT THEY REQUIRE. MY

00:45:24.121 --> 00:45:25.756
DAUGHTER IS NOW SEVEN AND SHE'S

00:45:25.823 --> 00:45:28.926
CONSIDERED HIGH FUNCTIONING.

00:45:28.992 --> 00:45:29.827
SHE WAS FIRST DIAGNOSED WITH

00:45:29.893 --> 00:45:32.930
AUTISM AGE TO AN AXIS ACCESSING

00:45:32.996 --> 00:45:34.698
SERVICES TO OUR REGIONAL CENTER

00:45:34.765 --> 00:45:37.901
WAS EASY ENOUGH BUT AT AGE

00:45:37.968 --> 00:45:38.502
THREE THEY WANTED TO TAKE HER

00:45:38.569 --> 00:45:39.736
OFF OF THE ALL TO REGIONAL

00:45:39.803 --> 00:45:42.873
SERVICES WHICH MEANS. THAT I

00:45:42.940 --> 00:45:44.341
HAD TO START THE PROCESS ALMOST

00:45:44.408 --> 00:45:46.743
ALL OVER AGAIN AND FIGHT FOR MY

00:45:46.810 --> 00:45:47.911
DAUGHTER SAID THAT SHE DIDN'T

00:45:47.978 --> 00:45:49.847
LOSE THOSE SERVICES I KNEW

00:45:49.913 --> 00:45:51.849
ABOUT THE LATTER MEN ACT AND SO

00:45:51.915 --> 00:45:53.417
I TOLD THEM THAT THEY WILL NOT

00:45:53.484 --> 00:45:54.685
TAKE HER OFF OF ALL TO REGIONAL

00:45:54.751 --> 00:45:58.322
SERVICES BECAUSE OF THE

00:45:58.388 --> 00:45:58.856
LETTERMAN ACTED THAT THEY

00:45:58.922 --> 00:45:59.389
NEEDED A SERVER TISSUE IS

00:45:59.456 --> 00:46:02.459
EIGHTEEN. SO WITH ACCESSING THE

00:46:02.526 --> 00:46:05.095
SERVICES. THE TRANSITION TO THE

00:46:05.162 --> 00:46:06.997
SPECIAL EDUCATION SYSTEM WAS

00:46:07.064 --> 00:46:09.066
SEVERELY CHALLENGING. THE

00:46:09.133 --> 00:46:10.067
SCHOOL WAS INITIALLY NOT

00:46:10.134 --> 00:46:11.435
ACCOMMODATING IN SETTING UP MY

00:46:11.502 --> 00:46:13.470
DAUGHTER'S IEP AND I HAD TO

00:46:13.537 --> 00:46:15.172
CONTINUALLY WORK WITH THEM. TO

00:46:15.239 --> 00:46:16.206
ENSURE THAT SHE WAS AN

00:46:16.273 --> 00:46:18.408
APPROPRIATE SETTING AND GETTING

00:46:18.475 --> 00:46:21.278
THE RIGHT CARE FOR HER NEEDS.

00:46:21.345 --> 00:46:23.013
BECAUSE EACH CHILD IS DIFFERENT

00:46:23.080 --> 00:46:25.516
AND SO IT WAS VERY FRUSTRATING

00:46:25.582 --> 00:46:26.650
TO HAVE TO FILL THAT I HAD TO

00:46:26.717 --> 00:46:29.419
FIGHT FOR HER TWICE. MY SON HE

00:46:29.486 --> 00:46:31.255
HAS A MUCH HIGHER NEED DUE TO A

00:46:31.321 --> 00:46:34.424
SEVERITY OF HIS DISABILITY AND

00:46:34.491 --> 00:46:34.992
FORTUNATELY HE QUALIFIED FOR

00:46:35.058 --> 00:46:37.995
MEDI CAL. WHICH HELPS COVER THE

00:46:38.061 --> 00:46:40.230
COST OF HIS CARE WITHOUT THIS

00:46:40.297 --> 00:46:43.233
COVERAGE MY CO PAY FOR ADVANCE

00:46:43.300 --> 00:46:46.170
BEHAVIOR ANALYSIS SERVICES.

00:46:46.236 --> 00:46:46.770
WOULD BE SEVENTEEN HUNDRED PER

00:46:46.837 --> 00:46:50.340
MONTH. WHICH IS WAY TOO MUCH

00:46:50.407 --> 00:46:51.975
WHEN I CAN BARELY PUT FOOD ON

00:46:52.042 --> 00:46:54.912
MY CHILD ON MY TABLE AT HOME

00:46:54.978 --> 00:46:56.280
HOWEVER ENROLLING MY SON IN

00:46:56.346 --> 00:46:57.481
MEDI CAL HAS BEEN A HUGE

00:46:57.548 --> 00:47:01.985
CHALLENGE IT WAS DELAYED AND IT

00:47:02.052 --> 00:47:02.553
DELAYED THE AXIS OF SERVICES

00:47:02.619 --> 00:47:05.055
THAT HE GREATLY NEEDED. I HAVE

00:47:05.122 --> 00:47:06.690
SPENT COUNTLESS DAYS FROM WORK

00:47:06.757 --> 00:47:08.792
OFF OF WORK ON THE PHONE TRYING

00:47:08.859 --> 00:47:11.261
TO NAVIGATE HOW TO ENROLL AND

00:47:11.328 --> 00:47:13.363
GET HIM COVERAGE THE PROBLEM

00:47:13.430 --> 00:47:13.931
ALL STEMMING FROM DIFFERENT

00:47:13.997 --> 00:47:17.267
INSURANCES. WHEN TRANSFERRING

00:47:17.334 --> 00:47:18.502
MY SENT OVER TO THE SPECIAL

00:47:18.569 --> 00:47:21.405
EDUCATION SYSTEM I RECALL THAT

00:47:21.471 --> 00:47:24.041
THE AYE AYE E. P. CHALLENGES.

00:47:24.107 --> 00:47:25.676
THAT I HAD EXPERIENCE WITH MY

00:47:25.742 --> 00:47:28.645
DAUGHTER AND I THOUGHT IT WAS

00:47:28.712 --> 00:47:29.246
BEST FOR MY KIDS IF I HIRED AN

00:47:29.313 --> 00:47:32.616

NAVIGATE THIS DEVELOPMENTAL

00:47:35.586 --> 00:47:38.488
SERVICE AS THIS SO COMMON AND

00:47:38.555 --> 00:47:40.691
IT'S BECAUSE OF THE COMPLEXITY.

00:47:40.757 --> 00:47:42.526
AND NOT KNOWING WHAT THEY'RE A

00:47:42.593 --> 00:47:44.494

PROGRESSION AND DEVELOPMENT HAS

00:48:03.747 --> 00:48:04.281
BEEN BECAUSE I HAVE FOUGHT FOR

00:48:04.348 --> 00:48:07.351
THEM. IN MY EXPERIENCE THE

IT SHOULD NOT BE THIS

00:48:17.027 --> 00:48:21.465
COMPLICATED. THIS AND IT SHOULD

00:48:21.531 --> 00:48:23.200
NOT REQUIRED THIS MUCH TIME

00:48:23.267 --> 00:48:25.202

HIS CHALLENGING BEHAVIORS. THE

00:48:42.019 --> 00:48:42.486
ENTIRE PROCESS HAS BEEN A

ALONE ONE WHO HAS FELT SHUT OUT

00:48:57.200 --> 00:48:59.469
OF THE SYSTEM AND I HOPE THIS

00:48:59.536 --> 00:49:00.103
COMMITTEE CAN STUDY THE

00:49:00.170 --> 00:49:01.638
PROBLEMS AND HELP FIX THE

00:49:01.705 --> 00:49:03.373
SYSTEM. SO THAT OTHER FAMILIES

00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:04.608
DO NOT HAVE TO ENTER WHAT WE

00:49:04.675 --> 00:49:06.943
HAVE IT TAKES A VILLAGE. TO

TESTIMONY I BELIEVE YOU'VE

00:49:17.521 --> 00:49:18.088
IDENTIFIED A NUMBER OF THINGS

00:49:18.155 --> 00:49:18.889
THAT WE NEED TO WORK ON BUT

00:49:18.955 --> 00:49:21.491
MAYBE WE'LL- TRY TO IDENTIFY

00:49:21.558 --> 00:49:23.093
SOME OF THOSE ISSUES AT THE NOW

00:49:23.160 --> 00:49:25.762
THAT MISS RAMA. RATHER MAIL YOU

00:49:25.829 --> 00:49:29.032
HAD SAID EARLIER THAT THE

00:49:29.099 --> 00:49:29.633
POLICY SEEM TO BE IN PLACE BUT

00:49:29.700 --> 00:49:32.769
WE'RE STILL. WERE STILL

00:49:32.836 --> 00:49:35.172
LACKING. WE CAN YOU EXPAND A

00:49:35.238 --> 00:49:35.972
LITTLE BIT ON THAT BECAUSE I

00:49:36.039 --> 00:49:37.174
FEEL LIKE IF WE HAVE THE

00:49:37.240 --> 00:49:38.308
POLICIES OF TRY TO FIGURE OUT

00:49:38.375 --> 00:49:39.910
FROM A LEGISLATIVE PERSPECTIVE

00:49:39.976 --> 00:49:41.845
AND FROM THE LEGISLATURE LIKE

00:49:41.912 --> 00:49:44.748
WHAT MORE CAN WE DO. TO ASSIST.

00:49:44.815 --> 00:49:47.150
I THINK THE AND THERE'S ALWAYS

00:49:47.217 --> 00:49:48.618
OVER ARCHING FISCAL.

00:49:48.685 --> 00:49:50.253
CONSIDERATIONS WITH THESE

00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:53.357
SYSTEMS ESPECIALLY AS YOU KNOW

00:49:53.423 --> 00:49:54.825
POPULATION NEEDS CHANGE OVER

00:49:54.891 --> 00:49:57.027
TIME AND COSTS OF DELIVERING

00:49:57.094 --> 00:49:58.562
SERVICES CAN GO UP AND

00:49:58.628 --> 00:50:00.263
SOMETIMES THIS STATE FUNDING

00:50:00.330 --> 00:50:02.232
FOR SUCH. SERVICES DOES NOT

00:50:02.299 --> 00:50:03.734
CHANGE STAYS FLAT SAID THERE

00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:05.402
ARE THOSE. I DO THINK OF A

00:50:05.469 --> 00:50:07.738
NUMBER OF THAT I'M CHALLENGES

00:50:07.804 --> 00:50:10.240
ARE ARE FISCALLY NATURE AND THE

00:50:10.307 --> 00:50:14.010
THERE'S ALSO. THE SILOS ARE

00:50:14.077 --> 00:50:16.012
JUST A PROBLEM AND THEY THEY

00:50:16.079 --> 00:50:17.047
COME DOWN AS YOU CAN HEAR IT

00:50:17.114 --> 00:50:18.382
LIKE THAT THE CHALLENGE OF

00:50:18.448 --> 00:50:21.451
WORKING WITH. HEALTH INSURANCE

00:50:21.518 --> 00:50:23.653
COMPANIES OR OR MEDI CAL OR

00:50:23.720 --> 00:50:25.055
COMMUNITY BASED PROVIDERS ARE

00:50:25.122 --> 00:50:26.690
SOMETIMES AND THROUGH REGIONAL

00:50:26.757 --> 00:50:27.524
CENTERS MAKE BE OFFICIALLY

00:50:27.591 --> 00:50:29.359
RECEIVING THE SERVICES FROM THE

00:50:29.426 --> 00:50:29.893
REGIONAL CENTERS BUT IT'S

00:50:29.960 --> 00:50:31.428
ACTUALLY LIKE A SUB CONTRACTED.

00:50:31.495 --> 00:50:34.631
PROVIDER SO IT'S JUST A LOT OF

00:50:34.698 --> 00:50:37.667
COMPLEXITY AND THAT DOES AND IT

00:50:37.734 --> 00:50:39.302
JUST THE ELF TO. A LACK OF

00:50:39.369 --> 00:50:41.238
ALIGNMENTS AND COORDINATION AND

00:50:41.304 --> 00:50:43.907
SO FINDING SOLUTIONS THAT HELP.

00:50:43.974 --> 00:50:46.042
PROMOTE A MORE COHESIVE KIND OF

00:50:46.109 --> 00:50:49.479
THAT CENTER FAMILIES IN A WAY

00:50:49.546 --> 00:50:51.815
MORE THAN I AND- YOU KNOW KIND

00:50:51.882 --> 00:50:53.550
OF LEAVE FAMILIES TO NAVIGATE

00:50:53.617 --> 00:50:55.419
ALL THIS ON THEIR OWN EIGHT I

00:50:55.485 --> 00:50:55.986
THINK THAT THAT'S THE PLACE

00:50:56.052 --> 00:50:56.620
WHERE THE LEGISLATIVE SOLUTIONS

00:50:56.686 --> 00:50:58.789
MIGHT BE. YEAH I'M JUST TRYING

00:50:58.855 --> 00:51:00.023
TO CHECK THE NUMBERS BRING AND

00:51:00.090 --> 00:51:01.825
MATCH AND YOU KNOW THE LACK OF

00:51:01.892 --> 00:51:04.161
GUIDANCE AND ASSISTANCE SO. AS

00:51:04.227 --> 00:51:09.132
A PARENT WERE THEY. FIRST THE

00:51:09.199 --> 00:51:11.334
FIRST BEGAN WHERE YOU GO.

00:51:11.401 --> 00:51:14.438
PLEASE THEY HAD TOLD US TO LOOK

UP WITH WARM LINE WHICH IS A

00:51:15.806 --> 00:51:16.406
PLACE THAT CAN KIND OF HELP YOU

00:51:16.473 --> 00:51:17.641
BUT UNLESS YOU KNOW ABOUT WARM

00:51:17.707 --> 00:51:18.141
LINE YOU DON'T KNOW THE

00:51:18.208 --> 00:51:18.708
RESEARCH SHOWS THAT ARE OUT

00:51:18.775 --> 00:51:20.477
THERE I. WITH MY FIRST CHILD

00:51:20.544 --> 00:51:24.381
DID NOT. ENGAGE WITH WARM LINE

00:51:24.448 --> 00:51:26.850
I ISOLATEDAND I KEPT MYSELF

00:51:26.917 --> 00:51:27.951
CLOSED IN BECAUSE I WAS

00:51:28.018 --> 00:51:30.554
MOURNING. I WAS HAVING A MANY

00:51:30.620 --> 00:51:33.056
DIFFERENT EMOTIONS. AND WITH MY

00:51:33.123 --> 00:51:34.291
SECOND CHILD WITH AUTISM IT

00:51:34.357 --> 00:51:35.959
LOOKED A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT

00:51:36.026 --> 00:51:37.661
BUT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT BECAUSE

00:51:37.727 --> 00:51:40.764
I HAVE HMO. DEAD WHEN I

00:51:40.831 --> 00:51:41.932
QUALIFIED FOR MEDI CAL IS

00:51:41.998 --> 00:51:44.167
BECAUSE MY INCOME. WAS NOT

00:51:44.234 --> 00:51:47.437
FEDERALLY A NAFF BUT IT WAS TOO

00:51:47.504 --> 00:51:49.306
MUCH TO GET ANY OTHER SERVICES.

00:51:49.372 --> 00:51:52.576
SO THAT. BECAME DIFFICULTY WHEN

00:51:52.642 --> 00:51:53.944

STRAIGHT MEDIC COW WHICH WAS

00:52:02.986 --> 00:52:04.821

EMBEDS MEN TO SAY HEY I NEED

00:52:08.458 --> 00:52:10.393
FEE FOR SERVICE I CAN'T. BE

00:52:10.460 --> 00:52:11.728
ENROLLED IN A HEALTH PLAN

00:52:11.795 --> 00:52:13.763

00:52:18.802 --> 00:52:23.006
COMMON FOR MANY PARENTS AND- A

00:52:23.073 --> 00:52:23.573
LOT OF PARENTS GIVE UP. AND

00:52:23.640 --> 00:52:27.777
THEY. THEY JUST SAY I DON'T

00:52:27.844 --> 00:52:29.379
KNOW WHAT TO DO. BUT I KEPT

00:52:29.446 --> 00:52:31.081
FIGHTING FOR MY CHILDREN AND

HAVE PRIVATE INSURANCE AND THE

00:52:46.029 --> 00:52:47.764

INSURANCE SO THAT TOOK SIX

00:52:55.572 --> 00:52:57.941
MONTHS. IT SHOULD NOT HAVE TOOK

00:52:58.008 --> 00:53:00.076
THAT LONG THEY SHOULD A HAD IT

00:53:30.840 --> 00:53:32.576
FIRST CHILD WITH AUTISM. SOUNDS

00:53:32.642 --> 00:53:35.078
LIKE THEY WERE IT A VITAL

00:53:35.145 --> 00:53:38.048
LIFELINE YEAH THEY ARE.

00:53:38.114 --> 00:53:38.648

00:53:43.820 --> 00:53:46.356
HERE I I'M NOT SURE I WOULD

00:53:46.423 --> 00:53:48.258
HOPE THEY DO I KNOW THAT THEY

00:53:48.325 --> 00:53:50.660
HAVE A HERE AND I REACHED OUT

00:53:50.727 --> 00:53:51.294
TO THEM THIS YEAR. WHAT WITH MY

00:53:51.361 --> 00:53:54.731
SECOND CHILD. IN MANY

00:53:54.798 --> 00:53:55.966
COMMUNITIES DO YOU BUY IT

00:53:56.032 --> 00:53:57.267
THINGS ARE ANY THAN ACROSS THE

00:53:57.334 --> 00:53:59.069
STATE. THERE LOCAL VARIANCES ON

00:53:59.135 --> 00:54:03.373
SOMETHING WE CAN. LOOK AT. AT

00:54:03.440 --> 00:54:05.041
WHAT AGE DO PARENTS TAKE THEIR

00:54:05.108 --> 00:54:07.043
CHILD TO GET A DEVELOPMENTAL

00:54:07.110 --> 00:54:08.845
SCREENING BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE

00:54:08.912 --> 00:54:10.981
PARENTS YOU PROBABLY IDENTIFY A

00:54:11.047 --> 00:54:12.148
LITTLE BIT EARLIER BUT BEFORE

00:54:12.215 --> 00:54:15.051
IT ACTUALLY GETS DIAGNOSED YEAH

00:54:15.118 --> 00:54:16.820
I MEAN IT WHAT'S THE TYPICAL

00:54:16.886 --> 00:54:17.988
AGE THAT WE SEE MAYBE ACROSS

00:54:18.054 --> 00:54:20.123
THE STATE MAYBE I WELL I THINK

00:54:20.190 --> 00:54:22.058
THAT'S WHY THE A. P. RECOMMENDS

00:54:22.125 --> 00:54:22.826
THAT CHILDREN GET THEM

00:54:22.892 --> 00:54:23.994
REGULARLY BECAUSE THINGS CAN

00:54:24.060 --> 00:54:25.862
SHOW UP OR AND YOU KNOW

00:54:25.929 --> 00:54:27.430
DIFFERENT CHILDREN DEVELOP IN

00:54:27.497 --> 00:54:29.299
DIFFERENT WAYS AND SO YOU KNOW

00:54:29.366 --> 00:54:31.601
SEND. THAT THE IDEA THAT EVERY

00:54:31.668 --> 00:54:33.703
THREE MONTHS EVERY THREE TO SIX

00:54:33.770 --> 00:54:34.270
MONTHS AND THAT THAT FIRST

00:54:34.337 --> 00:54:35.705
COUPLE OF YEARS OF LIFE THE

00:54:35.772 --> 00:54:36.906
CHILD IS GETTING SOME SORT OF

00:54:36.973 --> 00:54:38.008
DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENINGS IS

00:54:38.074 --> 00:54:40.810
BEST PRACTICE AND DOT SHOULD BE

00:54:40.877 --> 00:54:42.479
OCCURRING JUST AS PART OF WELL

00:54:42.545 --> 00:54:44.481
CHILD CARE THE SAME WAY

00:54:44.547 --> 00:54:45.915
CHILDREN ARE GETTING IN THE

00:54:45.982 --> 00:54:46.850
DISEASE THEIR SCHEDULES OF

00:54:46.916 --> 00:54:48.118
IMMUNIZATIONS OR SCHEDULES OF

00:54:48.184 --> 00:54:49.285
OTHER KIND OF I'M HEARING

00:54:49.352 --> 00:54:51.321
VISION CHECKS MOTOR TAX IT'S

00:54:51.388 --> 00:54:53.923
THE IDEAS THAT IS JUST EMBEDDED

00:54:53.990 --> 00:54:56.760
INTO HEALTH CARE. AND SO THAT

00:54:56.826 --> 00:54:58.194
FAMILIES WOULDN'T HAVE TO DO

00:54:58.261 --> 00:54:59.462
ANYTHING ADDITIONAL THEIR

00:54:59.529 --> 00:55:01.231
PEDIATRICIAN THEIR OR THEIR

00:55:01.297 --> 00:55:03.066
PLACE OF CARE THEIR HEALTHCARE

00:55:03.133 --> 00:55:05.068
PROVIDER WOULD BE A WHEN THEY

00:55:05.135 --> 00:55:06.002
SHOW UP FOR THE APPOINTMENT

00:55:06.069 --> 00:55:07.570
JUST HANDING THEM DEVELOPMENT

00:55:07.637 --> 00:55:10.173
OPINION THAT IDEALLY AND

00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:10.807
REVIEWING THE RESULTS WITH THEM

00:55:10.874 --> 00:55:16.246
AND TALK ABOUT IT BUT I HI. AS

00:55:16.312 --> 00:55:16.846
ANY PARENT HE'S DONE IT KNOWS

00:55:16.913 --> 00:55:22.218
IT'S NOT THAT EASY. AND SO WHAT

00:55:22.285 --> 00:55:23.787
IT SHOULD THE SCREENING STARTED

00:55:23.853 --> 00:55:24.654
BEEN RE SAYING ONE YEARS AND

00:55:24.721 --> 00:55:26.723
THEY CAN. THEY ARE DESIGNED AND

00:55:26.790 --> 00:55:27.891
THAT VALIDATED FOR DIFFERENT

00:55:27.957 --> 00:55:28.925
AGE RANGES TO DEPENDING ON THE

00:55:28.992 --> 00:55:30.260
EXACT AGE OF THE CHILD SO.

00:55:30.326 --> 00:55:31.161
THREE YEAR OR IF A CHILD IS. IN

00:55:31.227 --> 00:55:32.262
THREE MONTHS AND TWO WEEKS

00:55:32.328 --> 00:55:33.530
THERE'S A SPECIFIC SCREENING

00:55:33.596 --> 00:55:34.731
THAT THEY PULL OUT OF THE

00:55:34.798 --> 00:55:36.566
LIBRARIAN GIFT THAT IS SPECIFIC

00:55:36.633 --> 00:55:38.334
TO THAT PARTICULAR POINT OF

00:55:38.401 --> 00:55:40.236
DEVELOPMENT SO CHILDREN CAN

00:55:40.303 --> 00:55:41.738
START RECEIVING. DEVELOPMENTAL

00:55:41.805 --> 00:55:43.973
SCREENINGS AS EARLY AS RIGHT

00:55:44.040 --> 00:55:45.275
AFTER BIRTH AND WE DO KNOW THAT

00:55:45.341 --> 00:55:46.810
CERTAIN SCREENINGS LIKE NEWBORN

00:55:46.876 --> 00:55:48.745
HEARING. ARE ADMINISTERED RIGHT

00:55:48.812 --> 00:55:53.016
AFTER BIRTH YOU KNOW SO IT'S-

00:55:53.083 --> 00:55:53.583
THE DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENINGS

00:55:53.650 --> 00:55:58.088
IT'S MORE ON. AS A LITTLE BIT

00:55:58.154 --> 00:55:59.923
LATER IN THE POSTNATAL PERIOD.

00:55:59.989 --> 00:56:01.524
YES PLEASE WHAT WE REALIZE AS A

00:56:01.591 --> 00:56:02.425
FAMILY WAS THE EYE CONTACT WITH

00:56:02.492 --> 00:56:03.893
MY DAUGHTER AND THAT'S WHEN WE

00:56:03.960 --> 00:56:05.228
BROUGHT IT UP TO THE DOCTOR

00:56:05.295 --> 00:56:05.762
BECAUSE THERE WAS NO EYE

00:56:05.829 --> 00:56:08.832
CONTACT WITH ONLY PEOPLE THAT

00:56:08.898 --> 00:56:10.567
WOULD WATCH HER. A BIT VERY

00:56:10.633 --> 00:56:12.402
MINIMAL SO THAT'S WHAT GAVE US

00:56:12.469 --> 00:56:13.837
THE WARNING SIGN I AM AND I GOT

00:56:13.903 --> 00:56:17.107
HER DIAGNOSED AT AGE TO. BETTER

00:56:17.173 --> 00:56:18.641
BUT SHE NOTICED A LOT EARLIER

00:56:18.708 --> 00:56:20.710
BUT THE DIAGNOSES AND HAPPENED

00:56:20.777 --> 00:56:21.778
FOR YEAH SHE WENT AND SMILE AT

00:56:21.845 --> 00:56:24.314
ISSUE IN THE CASE IN THE EYES.

00:56:24.380 --> 00:56:27.016
BUT THE EARLY INTERVENTION A

00:56:27.083 --> 00:56:27.650
WITH THE UC DAVIS REALLY HELPED

00:56:27.717 --> 00:56:30.653
HER A LOT. PLEASE ONE OF THE

00:56:30.720 --> 00:56:34.891
THINGS THAT WAS. REALLY

00:56:34.958 --> 00:56:36.226
CRITICAL IN OUR CASE IS THAT

00:56:36.292 --> 00:56:37.660
THE SYMPTOMS THAT SHE WAS

00:56:37.727 --> 00:56:39.195
EXHIBITING MORE SUBTLE ENOUGH

00:56:39.262 --> 00:56:39.963
AND I'VE READ THAT THIS IS

00:56:40.029 --> 00:56:42.198
COMMON IN GIRLS NOT ISM THAT

00:56:42.265 --> 00:56:44.501
THE SYMPTOMS DON'T MATCH THE

00:56:44.567 --> 00:56:45.068
STEREO TYPE AND SO IS PEOPLE

00:56:45.135 --> 00:56:47.904
ARE REVIEWING THIS. TOOL IT'S

00:56:47.971 --> 00:56:48.505
BASICALLY A CHECKLIST OF THE

00:56:48.571 --> 00:56:49.506
PIECE OF PAPER YOU FILL OUT THE

00:56:49.572 --> 00:56:51.407
FORM. I WITH ALL THE OTHER

00:56:51.474 --> 00:56:52.842
FORMS ARE FILLING OUT IN THE

00:56:52.909 --> 00:56:55.879
WAITING ROOM AND- IN OKAY SO

00:56:55.945 --> 00:56:58.014
FOR EXAMPLE SHE WOULD POINT.

00:56:58.081 --> 00:56:59.149
BUT NOW I LOOK BACK AND I SEE

00:56:59.215 --> 00:57:00.950
OTHER PEOPLE'S KIDS AND THEY'RE

00:57:01.017 --> 00:57:01.518
PLAYING AND EVERYTHING AND

00:57:01.584 --> 00:57:02.118
THEY'RE MAD AT YOU IF YOU'RE

00:57:02.185 --> 00:57:03.820
NOT LOOKING AT THEM. MY

00:57:03.887 --> 00:57:04.454
DAUGHTER NEVER DID THAT BUT SHE

00:57:04.521 --> 00:57:07.323
PLEADED SOMETIMES. AND SO WE'VE

00:57:07.390 --> 00:57:08.725
CHECKED IT AS YEAH SHE POINTS

00:57:08.792 --> 00:57:10.560
AT THINGS WHEN REALLY. I KNOW

00:57:10.627 --> 00:57:12.028
NOW SHE DIDN'T POINT AT THINGS

00:57:12.095 --> 00:57:13.630
THE WAY OTHER KIDS DO AND SHE

00:57:13.696 --> 00:57:14.864
REALLY WAS MUCH MORE WITHDRAWN

00:57:14.931 --> 00:57:15.632
THAN OTHER KIDS AND LESS

00:57:15.698 --> 00:57:16.933
INTERESTED IN HER ENVIRONMENT

00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:18.601
THAN OTHER KIDS. BUT IT WAS

00:57:18.668 --> 00:57:19.402
SUBTLY ENOUGH THAT WITHOUT.

00:57:19.469 --> 00:57:21.437
WITH AN UNTRAINED EYE. AND

00:57:21.504 --> 00:57:22.605
WITHOUT THIS DEVELOPMENTAL

00:57:22.672 --> 00:57:24.874
SCREENING IMPLEMENTED BY

00:57:24.941 --> 00:57:27.310
SOMEONE WHO KNOWS WHAT TO LOOK

00:57:27.377 --> 00:57:27.911
FOR AND KNOWS THE DIFFERENCE.

00:57:27.977 --> 00:57:31.748
IT WAS MISSED. SO HOW CAN WE

00:57:31.815 --> 00:57:33.650
EXPANDER. SEEMS LIKE WE NEED TO

00:57:33.716 --> 00:57:34.250
EDUCATE PEOPLE TO LOOK FOR THE

00:57:34.317 --> 00:57:38.555
SIGNS. I MEAN WHAT DO WE HAVE.

00:57:38.621 --> 00:57:40.657
THAT YOU'RE AWARE OF IN THE

00:57:40.723 --> 00:57:41.558
STATE PROGRAMS THAT DO THAT I

00:57:41.624 --> 00:57:42.025
KNOW WE HAVE A LOT OF

00:57:42.091 --> 00:57:44.394
ORGANIZATIONS THAT I TEND YOU

00:57:44.460 --> 00:57:45.995
WILL HEAR LATER IN THE PANEL

00:57:46.062 --> 00:57:48.364
FROM HOME GROWN ONE OF THAT ONE

00:57:48.431 --> 00:57:49.699
OF THE KEY TENETS OF THE HELP

00:57:49.766 --> 00:57:50.967
ME GROW APPROACH IS ACTUALLY

00:57:51.034 --> 00:57:52.402
EDUCATING HEALTH PROVIDERS AND

00:57:52.468 --> 00:57:53.870
EDUCATIONAL PROVIDERS ON CHILD

00:57:53.937 --> 00:57:54.871
DEVELOPMENT AND ABOUT

00:57:54.938 --> 00:57:55.672
DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENINGS AND

00:57:55.738 --> 00:57:58.007
THINGS LIKE THAT. IN AND EAT IN

00:57:58.074 --> 00:57:59.175
A PERFECT WORLD A CHILD

01:03:05.982 --> 01:03:06.749
MONEY THAT SHE WANTED TO PUSH

01:03:06.816 --> 01:03:08.117
IT OFF SO THAT SHE CAN GET PAID

01:03:08.184 --> 01:03:10.086
MORE. I WISH I WOULD HAVE DONE

01:03:10.153 --> 01:03:11.854

FOUND HERSELF AS THE GUARDIAN

01:11:46.669 --> 01:11:49.605
OF HER. OWN WHEN SHE CAME TO MY

01:11:49.672 --> 01:11:52.941
CHILD HERE OF COURSE HER FACE

01:11:53.008 --> 01:11:55.110
IS DIFFERENT AND SO ALL THE

01:11:55.177 --> 01:11:57.413
OTHER CHILDREN ARE MAKING

01:11:57.479 --> 01:12:01.317
COMMENTS ABOUT IT AND SO IT IT.

01:12:01.383 --> 01:12:04.286
PUT ME IN A VERY I'M GONNA SAY

01:12:04.353 --> 01:12:07.523
REWARDING POSITION. BECAUSE I

01:12:07.589 --> 01:12:11.427
HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO TEACH

01:12:11.493 --> 01:12:12.327
THE OTHER CHILDREN IN MY CHILD

01:12:12.394 --> 01:12:16.365
CARE ENVIRONMENT. THAT APRIL

01:12:16.432 --> 01:12:18.667
WAS NO DIFFERENT THAN THEY WERE.

01:12:18.734 --> 01:12:21.036
I HELPED HER MOTHER NAVIGATE

01:12:21.103 --> 01:12:23.739
HER WAY THROUGH THE RED TAPE

01:12:23.806 --> 01:12:27.076
THROUGH THE REGIONAL CENTER.

01:12:27.142 --> 01:12:29.745
GET AND HURT HER CHILD CARE TO

01:12:29.812 --> 01:12:30.746
THE RESOURCE AND REFERRAL

01:12:30.813 --> 01:12:33.882
AGENCY SHE HAD HER SPEECH

01:12:33.949 --> 01:12:35.818
THERAPIST COME TO MY CHILD CARE

01:12:35.884 --> 01:12:37.720
TO COME WORK WITH APRIL AND THE

01:12:37.786 --> 01:12:41.090
OTHER KIDS GOT TO SEE THAT. SO

01:12:41.156 --> 01:12:43.025
IT WAS IT WAS AN AMAZING TIME

01:12:43.092 --> 01:12:49.031
BED. IT'S MORE THAN JUST AUTISM

01:12:49.098 --> 01:12:52.034
I ALSO HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE

01:12:52.101 --> 01:12:54.369
THE FIRST PERSON TO RECOGNIZE

01:12:54.436 --> 01:12:57.239
THAT ONE OF MY LITTLE ONES. I

01:12:57.306 --> 01:12:58.774
BELIEVE WAS ON THE SPECTRUM AND

01:12:58.841 --> 01:13:01.543
HE WAS. THE AUTISM SPECTRUM YOU

01:13:01.610 --> 01:13:04.413
CAN EITHER BE MILDLY AUTISTIC

01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:07.716
OR SEVERELY ARTISTIC. AND ONE

01:13:07.783 --> 01:13:09.184
OF THE BEAUTIFUL THINGS ABOUT

01:13:09.251 --> 01:13:10.619
WHAT WE'RE DOING IT AT SEIU

01:13:10.686 --> 01:13:13.455
LOCAL NINETY NINE IS WE HAVE A

01:13:13.522 --> 01:13:14.757
PARTNERSHIP WITH SPECIAL NEEDS

01:13:14.823 --> 01:13:16.125
IN THAT WORK. AND WE DO THESE

01:13:16.191 --> 01:13:19.161
WORKSHOPS AND WE INVITE ALL OF

01:13:19.228 --> 01:13:21.396
OUR PROVIDERS TO COME AND WE'RE

01:13:21.463 --> 01:13:25.768
TAUGHT ON SITE SIGNS TO LOOK

01:13:25.834 --> 01:13:26.568
FOR HAVEN'T A DIFFICULT

01:13:26.635 --> 01:13:28.771
CONVERSATION WITH PARENTS

01:13:28.837 --> 01:13:29.304
TELLING THEM THAT THERE'S

01:13:29.371 --> 01:13:32.040
SOMETHING. DIFFERENT ABOUT

01:13:32.107 --> 01:13:35.811
THEIR CHILD GIVING THEM

01:13:35.878 --> 01:13:39.148
RESOURCES AND FOLKS A CONTACT

01:13:39.214 --> 01:13:41.350
AND VOLUNTEERING TO HELP THEM

01:13:41.416 --> 01:13:45.654
NAVIGATE THEIR WAY THROUGH A

01:13:45.721 --> 01:13:46.288
SYSTEM THAT CLEARLY NEEDS TO BE

01:13:46.355 --> 01:13:49.525
REFORMED. I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY

01:13:49.591 --> 01:13:50.092
TO WORK WITH ANOTHER LITTLE

01:13:50.159 --> 01:13:51.126
GIRL WHO WE THOUGHT WAS JUST

01:13:51.193 --> 01:13:53.328
SEVERELY SHY IT TURNED OUT SHE

01:13:53.395 --> 01:13:55.230
HAD SELECTED MUTISM. WHICH

01:13:55.297 --> 01:13:58.600
MEANS. SHE WOULD NOT TALK TO

01:13:58.667 --> 01:14:03.238
ANYONE. AND NOT IT WAS ALMOST

01:14:03.305 --> 01:14:06.508
LIKE BEING AFRAID TO SPEAK SO

01:14:06.575 --> 01:14:09.912
I'M I'M SHARING DIFFERENT.

01:14:09.978 --> 01:14:13.081
SPECIAL NEEDS THAT ME AS A

01:14:13.148 --> 01:14:15.250
PROVIDER I WASN'T EQUIPPED FOR

01:14:15.317 --> 01:14:17.786
THIS WHEN I GOT MY LICENSE.

01:14:17.853 --> 01:14:18.754
IT'S ALL ABOUT THE HEALTH AND

01:14:18.821 --> 01:14:21.423
SAFETY OF THE CHILDREN BUT

01:14:21.490 --> 01:14:22.991
THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT I HAD

01:14:23.058 --> 01:14:27.296
TO LEARN AND WORK WITH. IN MY

01:14:27.362 --> 01:14:29.631
CHILD CARE ENVIRONMENT. IT'S

01:14:29.698 --> 01:14:31.400
SOME IT'S REALLY SAD BECAUSE

01:14:31.466 --> 01:14:33.902
THAT THE SYSTEM IT REALLY IS

01:14:33.969 --> 01:14:38.040
CONFUSING AND FRUSTRATING. AND

01:14:38.106 --> 01:14:39.675
DIFFICULT FOR PARENTS WHO ARE

01:14:39.741 --> 01:14:42.077
ARE ALREADY TRYING TO DEAL WITH.

01:14:42.144 --> 01:14:45.113
FIRST LEARNING THAT THEIR CHILD.

01:14:45.180 --> 01:14:47.983
HAS A SPECIAL NEED OR A

01:14:48.050 --> 01:14:50.819
DISABILITY BUT I THANK GOD THAT

01:14:50.886 --> 01:14:53.255
I ENDED UP BEING LIKE A PERSON

01:14:53.322 --> 01:14:56.291
WHO CAN BE THERE AS A SUPPORT.

01:14:56.358 --> 01:14:58.727
BUT NOT EVERY CHILD CARE

01:14:58.794 --> 01:15:02.431
PROVIDER OR CHILD CARE CENTER.

01:15:02.497 --> 01:15:05.100
HAS THE ABILITY TO DO THAT AND

01:15:05.167 --> 01:15:08.437
THEN IT'S REALLY SAD THE ONCE

01:15:08.503 --> 01:15:10.572
THEY LEAVE MY CHILD HERE AND

01:15:10.639 --> 01:15:12.341
NOW THEY'RE ENTERING INTO K.

01:15:12.407 --> 01:15:14.476
THROUGH TWELVE THEY HAVE TO

01:15:14.543 --> 01:15:15.043
JUMP THROUGH THESE HOPES ALL

01:15:15.110 --> 01:15:17.880
OVER AGAIN. THERE THAT'S A

01:15:17.946 --> 01:15:20.482
PROBLEM AND SO I'M REALLY

01:15:20.549 --> 01:15:21.884
THANKFUL THAT MY FELLOW

01:15:21.950 --> 01:15:23.652
COMMISSIONERS AND LEGISLATORS

01:15:23.719 --> 01:15:24.553
WHO WERE ON THE BLUE RIBBON

01:15:24.620 --> 01:15:26.421
COMMISSION THAT WE HAD AN

01:15:26.488 --> 01:15:27.756
OPPORTUNITY TO TALK ABOUT

01:15:27.823 --> 01:15:30.525
EVERYTHING WE LEFT NO STONE.

01:15:30.592 --> 01:15:32.060
UNTURNED COVERED IN OUR

01:15:32.127 --> 01:15:34.563
CONVERSATION AND WE DID IT

01:15:34.630 --> 01:15:37.232
OUTLINES SOME RECOMMENDATIONS

01:15:37.299 --> 01:15:38.233
TO ADDRESS THAT NOT ENOUGH

01:15:38.300 --> 01:15:40.636
THOUGH AND SO LIKE I SAID I

01:15:40.702 --> 01:15:42.905
APPLAUD THE PEER TO CAMBER

01:15:42.971 --> 01:15:45.007
BECAUSE I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT

01:15:45.073 --> 01:15:47.743
THEY WERE DEALING WITH. AND I'M

01:15:47.809 --> 01:15:51.079
GONNA HAND THE BATON OVER TO

01:15:51.146 --> 01:15:51.647
NANCY BECAUSE I'LL JUST PLAY

01:15:51.713 --> 01:15:55.183
HOCKEY. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR

MOVED TO MISS. THANK YOU I'M

01:15:58.020 --> 01:15:59.121
ONE OF RECOGNIZE THE TWO OTHER

01:15:59.187 --> 01:16:00.656
MEMBERS OF THE COMMISSION WHO

01:16:00.722 --> 01:16:02.557
ARE WITH THAT'S THE ASSEMBLY

01:16:02.624 --> 01:16:05.160
MEMBER MCCARTY AND- GOT HIS

01:16:05.227 --> 01:16:07.162
RAMOS AND I NOTICED THAT YOU

01:16:07.229 --> 01:16:09.464
BOTH SMILED WHEN TINY SAID WE

01:16:09.531 --> 01:16:13.769
LEFT NO STONE UNTURNED. I'M AND

01:16:13.835 --> 01:16:16.171
AGAIN I WANTED JUST REPEAT I

01:16:16.238 --> 01:16:17.906
THINK WHAT YOU SAID SO

01:16:17.973 --> 01:16:20.242
ELOQUENTLY ASSEMBLY WOMAN.

01:16:20.309 --> 01:16:22.978
GOMEZ REYES AND THAT IS. THAT

01:16:23.045 --> 01:16:24.446
FOR THE TWO PARENTS WHO SPOKE

01:16:24.513 --> 01:16:28.216
THEY ARE. ENOUGH AND NOT FOR

01:16:28.283 --> 01:16:29.918
THE CHILDREN OF CALIFORNIA AS

01:16:29.985 --> 01:16:31.820
WELL AS THEIR OWN CHILDREN. AND

01:16:31.887 --> 01:16:34.323
A REAL BASIS OF ALL OF THE WORK

01:16:34.389 --> 01:16:36.091
BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION WERE

01:16:36.158 --> 01:16:38.593
STRONG INPUT FROM PARENTS AND

01:16:38.660 --> 01:16:40.295
IS THE SAME WAY YOUR HEARING IS

01:16:40.362 --> 01:16:42.798
BASED A LOT ON BOTH THE

01:16:42.864 --> 01:16:43.765
RESEARCH THAT CHILDREN NOW

01:16:43.832 --> 01:16:44.866
PRESENTED IN THE

01:16:44.933 --> 01:16:46.201
RECOMMENDATIONS WILL PRESENT.

01:16:46.268 --> 01:16:47.302
AND THE PROGRAMS THAT WILL

01:16:47.369 --> 01:16:48.971
DISCUSS IN THE THIRD PANEL

01:16:49.037 --> 01:16:50.472
REALLY THE COURT A LOT OF FOR

01:16:50.539 --> 01:16:52.507
ALL OF US WHO REMEMBER WHEN WE

01:16:52.574 --> 01:16:54.676
LEAVE ARE THE TWO PARENTS. AND

01:16:54.743 --> 01:16:56.678
TIME HIS EXPERIENCES AS A

01:16:56.745 --> 01:17:01.016
PROVIDER AND THAT WAS PART OF

01:17:01.083 --> 01:17:02.617
OUR BASIS AS WELL. WE ALSO I

01:17:02.684 --> 01:17:04.886
THINK IT'S SO IN. WHAT YOU SAID

01:17:04.953 --> 01:17:07.322
ABOUT BREAKING DOWN SILOS WHEN

01:17:07.389 --> 01:17:08.490
WE STARTED THE BLUE RIBBON

01:17:08.557 --> 01:17:09.324
COMMISSION WE COULD HAVE

01:17:09.391 --> 01:17:11.660
STOPPED JESS TO CHILD CARE I

01:17:11.727 --> 01:17:15.530
GUESS YOU COULD STILL DO THAT.

01:17:15.597 --> 01:17:16.231
BUT WE REALIZE YOU CAN'T

01:17:16.298 --> 01:17:17.165
BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE REALLY

01:17:17.232 --> 01:17:19.835
TALKING ABOUT IS THE WELL BEING

01:17:19.901 --> 01:17:21.169
OF CHILDREN AND FUTURE

01:17:21.236 --> 01:17:23.605
CALIFORNIA. AND MAKING SURE

01:17:23.672 --> 01:17:25.674
THAT EVERY SINGLE CHILD CAN

01:17:25.741 --> 01:17:27.576
FEEL FILLED THEIR POTENTIAL SO

01:17:27.642 --> 01:17:29.678
THE DAY CAN ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO

01:17:29.745 --> 01:17:31.780
THEIR FULL POTENTIAL TO OUR

01:17:31.847 --> 01:17:34.282
STATE SO IT'S REALLY CRITICAL.

01:17:34.349 --> 01:17:36.284
THAT WE NOT LOOK AT SILOS AND

01:17:36.351 --> 01:17:40.022
WE TALKED A LOT IN OUR REPORT

01:17:40.088 --> 01:17:40.589
WHICH AS YOU CAN SEE IS VERY

01:17:40.655 --> 01:17:44.092
LONG. IT WAS HARD TO EXCERPTED.

01:17:44.159 --> 01:17:45.761
ABOUT SOME CULTURE CHANGES THAT

01:17:45.827 --> 01:17:47.696
NEEDED TO HAPPEN. SO WHEN YOU

01:17:47.763 --> 01:17:49.965
LOOK AT THE FACT THAT WE KNOW

01:17:50.032 --> 01:17:52.134
SO MUCH MORE THAN WE USED TO

01:17:52.200 --> 01:17:54.636
ABOUT INTERVENTION. WE KNOW SO

01:17:54.703 --> 01:17:57.572
MUCH MORE THAN WE USED TO ABOUT

01:17:57.639 --> 01:18:00.675
IDENTIFICATION. AND WHAT WE

01:18:00.742 --> 01:18:02.677
HAVE TO DO IS TAKE THE

01:18:02.744 --> 01:18:04.479
SUCCESSFUL SERVICE MODELS WE

01:18:04.546 --> 01:18:06.982
HAVE. TAKE THE SYSTEMS WE HAVE

01:18:07.049 --> 01:18:09.418
THAT TOUCH CHILDREN AND REALLY

01:18:09.484 --> 01:18:11.353
BREAK DOWN THE SILOS AND CHANGE

01:18:11.420 --> 01:18:12.888
THE CULTURES FROM A CULTURE OF

01:18:12.954 --> 01:18:15.657
COMPLIANCE AND RULES. TO A

01:18:15.724 --> 01:18:17.059
WELCOMING CULTURE SELECT SAID

01:18:17.125 --> 01:18:20.228
THE WARM LINE IS OUR MODEL NOT

01:18:20.295 --> 01:18:22.731
SEVENTEENTH PAGE FORMS TO SEE

01:18:22.798 --> 01:18:26.201
IF YOU'RE ONE DOLLAR OVER. ONE

01:18:26.268 --> 01:18:28.703
QUARTER OF THIS YEAR TO GET

01:18:28.770 --> 01:18:29.738
SERVICES AND SO WE TALKED A LOT

01:18:29.805 --> 01:18:31.706
ABOUT THAT AND NOT. THAT WE

01:18:31.773 --> 01:18:33.408
DON'T HAVE A VERY STRONG

01:18:33.475 --> 01:18:35.277
EMPHASIS ON FOCUSING ON THOSE

01:18:35.343 --> 01:18:36.378
MOST IN NEED THOSE WHO ARE LOW

01:18:36.445 --> 01:18:37.479
INCOME LOOKING AT

01:18:37.546 --> 01:18:39.448
DISCRIMINATION. BUT DOING THAT

01:18:39.514 --> 01:18:40.849
ALL WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF

01:18:40.916 --> 01:18:42.484
TRUSTING AND LISTENING PARENTS

01:18:42.551 --> 01:18:45.053
AND BREAKING DOWN SILOS. SO

01:18:45.120 --> 01:18:47.122
JUST TO LOOK SPECIFICALLY AT

01:18:47.189 --> 01:18:48.590
SOME OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS

01:18:48.657 --> 01:18:49.858
THAT I WOULD COMMEND PEOPLE

01:18:49.925 --> 01:18:52.561
READ OUR WHOLE REPORT REALLY

01:18:52.627 --> 01:19:00.168
NICE. OVERRIDE OR GOING INTO IT.

01:19:00.235 --> 01:19:02.003
BUT ALSO I THINK IT'S SAD. YOU

01:19:02.070 --> 01:19:02.871
CAN LOOK AT HOW THINGS FIT

01:19:02.938 --> 01:19:03.939
TOGETHER AS WELL AS THE

01:19:04.005 --> 01:19:05.574
INDIVIDUAL WHAT'S SO OUR FIRST

01:19:05.640 --> 01:19:06.942
SET OF RECOMMENDATIONS HAD TO

01:19:07.008 --> 01:19:09.544
DO THAT THE QUALITY IS NOT

01:19:09.611 --> 01:19:11.446
EQUITY. SO YOU WERE TALKING

01:19:11.513 --> 01:19:13.548
ABOUT THE DIFFERENCES IN TERMS

01:19:13.615 --> 01:19:14.916
OF PEOPLE BINDING EARLY

01:19:14.983 --> 01:19:17.018
INTERVENTION SERVICES YOU KNOW

01:19:17.085 --> 01:19:18.753
WE CAN SAY WELL ANYONE CAN FIND

01:19:18.820 --> 01:19:20.622
A REGIONAL CENTER BUT THERE'S A

01:19:20.689 --> 01:19:22.157
LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS THAT GO

01:19:22.224 --> 01:19:23.425
INTO IT IN TERMS OF FAMILY'S

01:19:23.492 --> 01:19:25.093
EXPERIENCES FAMILIES ACCESS TO

01:19:25.160 --> 01:19:28.163
RESOURCES. A MEDICAL HOME AND

01:19:28.230 --> 01:19:28.964
SO YOU HAVE TO REALLY SPOKE

01:19:29.030 --> 01:19:33.401
FOCUS ON SPECIAL KINDS OF.

01:19:33.468 --> 01:19:36.171
BARRIERS THAT FAMILIES HAVE AS

01:19:36.238 --> 01:19:37.139
WELL AS SPECIAL STRENGTHS THAT

01:19:37.205 --> 01:19:39.474
FAMILIES HAVE ON. AND RACIAL

01:19:39.541 --> 01:19:41.743
DISCRIMINATION AND POVERTY AND

01:19:41.810 --> 01:19:42.811
RURAL AREA YOU KNOW THERE'S

01:19:42.878 --> 01:19:44.412
MANY DIFFERENT THINGS AND WE

01:19:44.479 --> 01:19:47.415
FOCUSED ON ALL OF THOSE. SO

01:19:47.482 --> 01:19:49.784
WHEN WE LOOK AT LOOK AT EARLY

01:19:49.851 --> 01:19:50.752
INTERVENTION CHILDREN WITH

01:19:50.819 --> 01:19:52.587
DISABILITIES IT'S IMPORTANT WE

01:19:52.654 --> 01:19:54.389

01:20:10.071 --> 01:20:12.240
WHOLE OTHER SET OF EYES AND

01:20:12.307 --> 01:20:12.841
EXPERTISE THAT WOULD LOOK AT

01:20:12.908 --> 01:20:15.043
EARLY INTERVENTION. IF YOU ALSO

01:20:15.110 --> 01:20:16.711

CHILD CARE SYSTEM WITH NO

WAITING LISTS. THAT ALSO WOULD

01:20:34.362 --> 01:20:35.564
BE ANOTHER SET OF EYES LOOKING

ABOUT SOME OF THE SUCCESSFUL A

01:21:12.834 --> 01:21:14.569
SERVICE MODELS AND WHAT THOSE

01:21:14.636 --> 01:21:17.305
COULD COULD MEAN TO KIDS WE

01:21:17.372 --> 01:21:19.140
WANT TO REALLY EXPAND THE CHILD

01:21:19.207 --> 01:21:20.775
BUYING PROGRAM SO THAT WE ARE

01:21:20.842 --> 01:21:22.444
OF PERMITTED THE LOOKING FOR

KIDS THAT NEED SERVICES. AND

01:21:24.679 --> 01:21:26.348
NOT HAVING PARENTS GO THROUGH

01:21:26.414 --> 01:21:30.585
ALL OF THESE BARRIERS. AND

01:21:30.652 --> 01:21:31.653
EXPAND THE CAPACITY OF EARLY

01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:33.355
START AN ELIGIBILITY

01:21:33.421 --> 01:21:35.657
DETERMINATION SO THAT IT'S NOT%

01:21:35.724 --> 01:21:38.460
33% AND 25% AND I MYSELF WHEN I

01:21:38.526 --> 01:21:39.928
WAS A STAFFER WORKED ON SOME OF

01:21:39.995 --> 01:21:41.162
THOSE DEFINITIONS. AND YOU DO

01:21:41.229 --> 01:21:42.897
NEED DEFINITIONS BUT YOU ALSO

01:21:42.964 --> 01:21:45.000
NEED TO HAVE LIKE A KIND OF

01:21:45.066 --> 01:21:46.067
DEFINITION SO THAT YOU COULD

01:21:46.134 --> 01:21:48.670
REALLY INCLUDE KIDS. THAT WILL

01:21:48.737 --> 01:21:50.038
MOST BENEFIT FROM EARLY

01:21:50.105 --> 01:21:52.240
INTERVENTION. WE WANT TO

01:21:52.307 --> 01:21:54.276
ESTABLISH A TASK FORCE TO LOOK

AT ALL THESE DIFFERENT FUNDING

01:21:55.777 --> 01:21:57.412
SOURCES YOU KNOW THERE'S SO

01:21:57.479 --> 01:21:59.114
MANY DIFFERENT THINGS AT THE

01:21:59.180 --> 01:22:00.582
STATE LEVEL THERE'S FEDERAL

01:22:00.649 --> 01:22:04.586
THEIR STATE. IN REALLY REMOVE

01:22:04.653 --> 01:22:05.820
THE BARRIERS LEADING TO THE

01:22:05.887 --> 01:22:06.788
DELAY TRANSITION BECAUSE IT'S

01:22:06.855 --> 01:22:09.557
NOT THAT THREE IS A BARRIER

01:22:09.624 --> 01:22:12.127
BECAUSE OF SOMETHING INHERENT

01:22:12.193 --> 01:22:12.727
IN THE CHILDREN IT'S INHERENT

01:22:12.794 --> 01:22:15.697
IN OUR- SYSTEM. IN THE

01:22:15.764 --> 01:22:17.399
TRANSITION THAT HAS TO GET MADE

01:22:17.465 --> 01:22:19.000
AND ALSO TO BRIDE AND SOME OF

01:22:19.067 --> 01:22:20.969
THE CURRENT LEGAL DEFINITIONS

01:22:21.036 --> 01:22:23.538
SO THAT WE CAN REALLY CAPTURE

01:22:23.605 --> 01:22:25.573
ALL THE CHILDREN THEY CAN. CAN

01:22:25.640 --> 01:22:27.342
DO THIS ELIMINATE THE RACIAL

01:22:27.409 --> 01:22:28.877
DISPARITIES THAT CHILDREN NOW

01:22:28.943 --> 01:22:30.045

SUBMITTED THIS PORT PERSONALITY

01:22:31.880 --> 01:22:34.382
AND DISCIPLINE PRACTICES BUT

01:22:34.449 --> 01:22:37.218
DON'T RECOGNIZE. A SOME OF THE

01:22:37.285 --> 01:22:39.120
CHALLENGES BASED ON SPECIAL

01:22:39.187 --> 01:22:41.823
NEEDS BUT RATHER DO LOOK AT IT

01:22:41.890 --> 01:22:43.258
FOR THAT I DISCIPLINE. SORT OF

01:22:43.325 --> 01:22:45.827
YOU THIS WAS VERY FAST IN TERMS

01:22:45.894 --> 01:22:47.329
OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS BUT I DO

01:22:47.395 --> 01:22:49.698
THINK WITHIN THE REPORT AS WELL

01:22:49.764 --> 01:22:51.299

THE DEVELOPMENT OF ALL OF

01:22:54.169 --> 01:22:55.370
THESE. THEY'RE BOTH VERY

01:22:55.437 --> 01:22:57.272
SPECIFIC IDEAS FOR THINGS WE

01:22:57.339 --> 01:22:59.607
COULD DO LIKE EXPAND CHILD BY

01:22:59.674 --> 01:23:03.044
AS WELL AS REALLY. LOOKING AT

01:23:03.111 --> 01:23:05.947
BROADER IT KIND OF THE BROADER

01:23:06.014 --> 01:23:07.782
SYSTEM AND HOW WE CAN INTEGRATE

01:23:07.849 --> 01:23:10.018
THAT ALSO VERY HAPPY TO SAY

01:23:10.085 --> 01:23:12.887
THAT IN THE BUDGET THAT WAS

01:23:12.954 --> 01:23:16.091
PASSED INSIDE OUR- OUR ADVISORY

AND ADVISE THE LEGISLATURE THE

01:23:25.066 --> 01:23:30.705
GOVERNOR AND THE SUPERINTENDENT.

01:23:30.772 --> 01:23:36.311
INTEGRATED WAY I AND ALL OF THE.

LOOK AT UNIVERSAL AS WELL AS

01:23:38.246 --> 01:23:39.614
THE PARTICULARITIES. IS IN THE

01:23:39.681 --> 01:23:41.416

01:23:41.483 --> 01:23:44.619
REALITY AS WE LOOK TOWARDS THE

ALL HAVE TAKEN SAID TO

01:23:47.956 --> 01:23:50.792
LEADERSHIP ON INITIATING. AB

01:23:50.859 --> 01:23:53.328
ONE THING PLEASE PLEASE JUST.

TO WORK WITH THESE CHILDREN I

01:24:02.637 --> 01:24:04.773
THINK WE RECOMMENDED ALSO MAYBE

01:24:04.839 --> 01:24:06.007
NOT IN THESE WORDS THESE TERMS

01:24:06.074 --> 01:24:09.544
BUT REALLY WORKING ON A WAY ON

01:24:09.611 --> 01:24:11.780
RETAINING THOSE FOLKS IN

BRINGING MORE FOLKS IN WHO WANT

01:24:15.216 --> 01:24:16.484

01:24:16.551 --> 01:24:19.454
SO. PRECIOUS AND SO VALUABLE

01:24:19.521 --> 01:24:22.123
AND SO CRITICAL BUT THAT WORK

01:24:22.190 --> 01:24:25.860
FORCE DEFINITELY NEEDS TO BE

01:24:25.927 --> 01:24:29.164
COMPENSATED AND APPRECIATE IT

01:24:29.230 --> 01:24:29.731

HEARD EVEN EARLIER HOW

01:24:33.768 --> 01:24:35.470
IMPORTANT HAVING THAT GUIDANCE

01:24:35.537 --> 01:24:37.539
AND IS TO ACTUALLY NAVIGATING

01:24:37.605 --> 01:24:38.907
EVERYTHING THERE'S A LOT OF

01:24:38.973 --> 01:24:40.241
RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE B. R. C.

01:24:40.308 --> 01:24:41.776
REPORTED I KNOW SOME OF OUR

01:24:41.843 --> 01:24:43.077
MEMBERS ARE REALLY FAMILIAR

01:24:43.144 --> 01:24:45.246
WITH THAT. BUT HOW DO WE

01:24:45.313 --> 01:24:47.949
PRIORITIZE LIKE YOU KNOW THE

01:24:48.016 --> 01:24:49.017
FOR REALLY GETTING OUT EARLY

01:24:49.083 --> 01:24:51.619
INTERVENTION SERVICES IS IT

01:24:51.686 --> 01:24:53.354
LOOKING AT THE RACIAL

01:24:53.421 --> 01:24:53.922
DISPARITIES THAT YOU JUST

01:24:53.988 --> 01:24:55.990
MENTIONED IS AT LOOKING AT IS

01:24:56.057 --> 01:24:58.393
IT ALL JUST FUNDING IS IT.

01:24:58.460 --> 01:25:00.228
TRYING TO FIND THE ADVOCATES OF

01:25:00.295 --> 01:25:00.962
MAKING SURE THAT THEY'RE

01:25:01.029 --> 01:25:02.464
COMPENSATED AND DIRECTING

01:25:02.530 --> 01:25:05.567
PEOPLE THE RIGHT WAY HOW DO WE

01:25:05.633 --> 01:25:06.167
BEGIN TO TACKLE THAT ISSUE IT

01:25:06.234 --> 01:25:09.804
JUST. MAYBE YOUR PERSONAL

01:25:09.871 --> 01:25:11.439
RECOMMENDATION IS HOW DO WE-

01:25:11.506 --> 01:25:16.511
WHERE SHE WOULD START. ONE OF

01:25:16.578 --> 01:25:18.446
THE QUESTIONS DIRECTED TO HEAR.

01:25:18.513 --> 01:25:22.217
I'M WELL I SPEAK FOR MYSELF I

01:25:22.283 --> 01:25:23.952
WAS LAZY CONSULTED I'VE BEEN A

01:25:24.018 --> 01:25:26.654
STAFFER I WAS AN ADVOCATE I'VE-

01:25:26.721 --> 01:25:27.255
BEEN AROUND A LONG TIME IF YOU

01:25:27.322 --> 01:25:32.494
CAN TELL. AND I THINK THAT

01:25:32.560 --> 01:25:33.261
WE'RE STARTING IN THE RIGHT

01:25:33.328 --> 01:25:34.562
PLACE WHEN I SAID THE ADVISORY

01:25:34.629 --> 01:25:35.763
COMMITTEE AND SENATOR ZELL

01:25:35.830 --> 01:25:37.665
ADVISORY COMMITTEES REPORTS

01:25:37.732 --> 01:25:40.468
THAT IT THAT. BUT I THINK THAT

01:25:40.535 --> 01:25:41.069
ALL THE AERATION AND BREAKING

01:25:41.135 --> 01:25:42.704
DOWN THE SILOS AT THE YEAH

01:25:42.770 --> 01:25:44.172
RACING DOWN THE SILOS IT'S

01:25:44.239 --> 01:25:47.075
LOOKING AT STARTING WITH THE

01:25:47.141 --> 01:25:49.677
NEEDS OF CHILDREN AND FAMILIES.

01:25:49.744 --> 01:25:52.313
ADD NOT STARTING WITH THE NEEDS

01:25:52.380 --> 01:25:54.148
OF BUDGET OR FEDERAL

01:25:54.215 --> 01:25:56.985
REGULATIONS I'M AND I THINK

01:25:57.051 --> 01:25:58.319
CALIFORNIA HAS REALLY BEEN A

01:25:58.386 --> 01:26:00.054
LEADER IN THAT I MEAN A LOT OF

01:26:00.121 --> 01:26:00.922
THE WORK THAT WE DO AND WHAT

01:26:00.989 --> 01:26:02.090
YOU'LL SEE DESCRIBED IN THE

01:26:02.156 --> 01:26:04.759
NEXT PANEL WE REALLY HAVE BILL

01:26:04.826 --> 01:26:06.561
PROGRAMS BASED IN THAT KIND OF

01:26:06.628 --> 01:26:09.063
WAY AND SO I WOULD SAY. THAT

01:26:09.130 --> 01:26:11.733
LOOKING OVERALL SYSTEMICALLY SO

01:26:11.799 --> 01:26:14.235
THAT WE ARE TAKING THIS

01:26:14.302 --> 01:26:15.770
INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY WITH THE

01:26:15.837 --> 01:26:18.439
LEGISLATURE THAT WE HAVE BOTH

01:26:18.506 --> 01:26:19.474
THE ASSEMBLY AND THE SENATE I

01:26:19.541 --> 01:26:21.776
WORKED IN BOTH. AS WELL AS THE

01:26:21.843 --> 01:26:24.178
GOVERNOR'S COMMITMENT TO THESE

01:26:24.245 --> 01:26:25.847
KIND OF ISSUES THAT I WILL

01:26:25.914 --> 01:26:26.814
LEAVE ASIDE THE FEDERAL

01:26:26.881 --> 01:26:31.853
GOVERNMENT UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY.

01:26:31.920 --> 01:26:36.291
MY PERSONAL OPINION. THAT WE

01:26:36.357 --> 01:26:37.325
HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY.

01:26:37.392 --> 01:26:38.426
MAKE CHANGE AND BREAK DOWN

01:26:38.493 --> 01:26:39.160
SILOS AND LOOK OVER OUR BIG

01:26:39.227 --> 01:26:41.629
GOALS. AS WELL AS WORKING ON

01:26:41.696 --> 01:26:44.098
VERY SPECIFIC SMALLER GOALS

01:26:44.165 --> 01:26:46.067
LIKE IF WE CHANGE CHILD FINE

01:26:46.134 --> 01:26:47.435
AND DID SOME OF THE CHANGES IN

01:26:47.502 --> 01:26:50.004
THE TRANSITION. BETWEEN THE

01:26:50.071 --> 01:26:51.639
REGIONAL CENTERS AND THE SCHOOL

01:26:51.706 --> 01:26:53.541
DISTRICT THAT WOULD MAKE A HUGE

01:26:53.608 --> 01:26:57.111
DIFFERENCE IF WE LOOK AT RACIAL

01:26:57.178 --> 01:26:58.479
YOU KNOW CONTINUE SOME OF THE

01:26:58.546 --> 01:27:01.082
RESEARCH THIS GOD ON ABOUT WHY

01:27:01.149 --> 01:27:02.884
ARE YOU KNOW WHAT ARE THESE

01:27:02.951 --> 01:27:04.852
DISPARITIES BASED IN HOW COULD

01:27:04.919 --> 01:27:06.554
WE THROUGH THE CHILD BY PROGRAM

01:27:06.621 --> 01:27:08.056
IN OTHER WAYS. THROUGH MEDI CAL

01:27:08.122 --> 01:27:09.891
CHANGES MAKE SURE THAT THERE

01:27:09.958 --> 01:27:11.292
WAS BETTER ACCESS ACROSS ALL

01:27:11.359 --> 01:27:13.094
THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT WOULD

01:27:13.161 --> 01:27:14.395
MAKE A DIFFERENCE AND I ALSO

CONNECTED VESTED PILOTS WHO ARE

01:27:22.303 --> 01:27:24.772
HOMELESS REFUGEE STATUS. IF WE

01:27:24.839 --> 01:27:30.478
REALLY COULD. NET CHILDREN WITH

01:27:33.982 --> 01:27:35.016

01:29:46.848 --> 01:29:47.415
SPECIFICS OF TODAY'S HEARING IS

KNOW THERE ARE FEW PROPOSALS I

01:30:02.897 --> 01:30:03.998
WORK IN A ONE THIS YEAR BUT IN

01:30:04.065 --> 01:30:06.234
THE REPORT YOU TALK ABOUT MAYBE

01:30:06.300 --> 01:30:07.135
YOU CAN THIS WOULD BE A

01:30:07.201 --> 01:30:09.637
HIGHLIGHT TO US TODAY IS THAT

01:30:09.704 --> 01:30:10.872
THERE ARE RESOURCES FROM THE

01:30:10.938 --> 01:30:12.406
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WE HAVE THE

01:30:12.473 --> 01:30:13.841
MEDI CAL PROGRAM WE'RE NOT

01:30:16.444 --> 01:30:18.913
AS MUCH AS WE COULD. TO DO THAT

01:30:18.980 --> 01:30:22.083
WORK AT THE AT AT AT THE AT THE

01:30:22.150 --> 01:30:23.518
BEGINNING WAS WONDERING IF YOU

01:30:23.584 --> 01:30:26.087
CAN TALK ABOUT THAT A LITTLE

01:30:26.154 --> 01:30:27.155
BIT NANCY AND WHAT

01:30:27.221 --> 01:30:27.789
OPPORTUNITIES WE MAY HAVE IN

01:30:27.855 --> 01:30:30.158
CALIFORNIA FTA TO LEVERAGE OUR

01:30:30.224 --> 01:30:33.861
STATE MONEY TO BRING DOWN MORE

01:30:33.928 --> 01:30:34.428
RESOURCES FOR THE WORK WE'RE

01:30:34.495 --> 01:30:40.935
TRYING TO DO. I'M. I THINK THAT

01:30:41.002 --> 01:30:44.872
WE HAVE IN IF YOU LOOK. IN

01:30:44.939 --> 01:30:45.473
DEATH AS THE HAND OUT THE FOUR

01:30:45.540 --> 01:30:49.677
PAGE HANDOUT. WE TALK ABOUT WE

01:30:49.744 --> 01:30:51.312

01:30:51.379 --> 01:30:53.414
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE MAKE

01:30:53.481 --> 01:30:55.383
AND FROM PAGE EIGHTY TO NINETY

01:30:55.449 --> 01:30:56.217
IF YOU'RE THE WHOLE REPORTED

01:30:56.284 --> 01:30:59.187
IT'S ON PAGE FOUR. OF THE HAND

01:30:59.253 --> 01:31:02.356
OUT AND SO I THINK THAT WHAT WE

01:31:02.423 --> 01:31:04.725
WANT TO DO IS MAKE SURE THAT

01:31:04.792 --> 01:31:06.027

NEVER FORGET THAT IT TOOK FOUR

01:31:10.898 --> 01:31:14.902

01:31:14.969 --> 01:31:18.739
INSURANCE CODE ON THE MEDIC HOW.

01:31:18.806 --> 01:31:20.141
KIND OF APPLICATION SO I MEAN

01:31:20.208 --> 01:31:21.008
THE FIRST THING WE CAN DO IS

01:31:21.075 --> 01:31:23.878
JUST MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S

01:31:23.945 --> 01:31:24.478
VERY GOOD TRAINING WHEN PEOPLE

ELIGIBILITY FOR A CHILD AND

01:31:33.621 --> 01:31:34.956
INTEGRATION OF SERVICES BUT WE

01:31:46.167 --> 01:31:48.502
STILL RITUALISTIC. TO LOOK AT

01:31:48.569 --> 01:31:49.637

THE MID SEVENTIES ON A REGIONAL

01:59:51.684 --> 01:59:53.586
CENTER SIDE WE'VE ACTUALLY HAD

01:59:53.653 --> 01:59:55.254
DECREASES. IN ON OUR CD HE

01:59:55.321 --> 01:59:57.957
SIGHED WE HAD A LITTLE BIT OF

01:59:58.024 --> 01:59:59.492
FUNDING INCREASE BY GOVERNOR

01:59:59.559 --> 02:00:02.194
DEUKMEJIAN IN NINETEEN EIGHTY

02:00:02.261 --> 02:00:03.195
SIX BUT NOTHING ELSE WE

02:00:03.262 --> 02:00:05.831
RECENTLY ELIMINATED FIVE POINT

02:00:05.898 --> 02:00:10.703
FIVE POSITIONS ARE NURSING. IF

A FAMILY MENTAL HEALTH SO. THE

02:00:15.441 --> 02:00:16.576
FUNDING IN DOES HAVE A HUGE

02:00:16.642 --> 02:00:18.010
IMPACT ESPCIALLY SINCE THE

02:00:18.077 --> 02:00:19.211
RESEARCH BASE TO GO OUT TO THE

02:00:19.278 --> 02:00:21.447
FAMILIES AND PROVIDE A COACHING

02:00:21.514 --> 02:00:24.250
MODEL WITH THE FAMILIES ON

02:00:24.317 --> 02:00:26.485
EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES OF.

02:00:26.552 --> 02:00:28.521
WHAT DO THEY DO DURING THE DAY

02:00:28.588 --> 02:00:30.856
WATER THEIR ROUTINES WHAT IS A

02:00:30.923 --> 02:00:32.425
LEVEL OF UNDERSTANDING OF CHILD

02:00:32.491 --> 02:00:33.859
DEVELOPMENT AND INTERVENTION

02:00:33.926 --> 02:00:35.094
ACTIVITIES THAT'LL HELP

02:00:35.161 --> 02:00:36.696
PARTICIPATION IN THE FAMILY AND

02:00:36.762 --> 02:00:39.432
THEN THOSE. DIFFERENT

02:00:39.498 --> 02:00:41.534
DISCIPLINES WILL GO OUT AND

DIFFERENT DIVERSE DISCIPLINES

02:00:45.972 --> 02:00:47.807
WORK TOGETHER SO TRAVELING OUT

02:00:47.873 --> 02:00:52.011
TO THE HOMES WAS NOT EVER ON

02:00:52.078 --> 02:00:52.545
THE COST OF THAT WAS NEVER

02:00:52.612 --> 02:00:55.781
MITIGATED WHEN. AND THE EARLY

02:00:55.848 --> 02:00:58.084
START WAS PASSED IN NINETEEN

02:00:58.150 --> 02:00:59.318
NINETY THREE SO THE FUNDING

02:00:59.385 --> 02:01:00.620
STATE FLAT BUT OUR COST

02:01:00.686 --> 02:01:04.523
INCREASE. TO TRAVEL OUT TO THE

02:01:04.590 --> 02:01:05.725

SEEING SIX TO EIGHT FAMILIES A

02:01:07.259 --> 02:01:09.061
DAY WE CAN ONLY SEE TWO TO

02:01:09.128 --> 02:01:09.695

HUNDRED FAMILIES DOWN TO NINETY

02:01:19.038 --> 02:01:21.040
FAMILIES BECAUSE THE RATES ARE

02:01:21.107 --> 02:01:22.575
PAYING US WE CAN'T SUSTAIN OUR

02:01:22.642 --> 02:01:24.777

SCREENING PRACTICES BUT I

02:02:07.219 --> 02:02:08.087
WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT SO FOR

HAVING THE CONVERSATION ABOUT

02:02:18.397 --> 02:02:19.832
INFRASTRUCTURE LIMITATIONS AND

02:02:19.899 --> 02:02:21.901

SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF

02:02:22.835 --> 02:02:24.670
SCREENING DIFFICULT TO PRACTICE

02:02:24.737 --> 02:02:26.305
A LACK OF FINANCIAL INCENTIVES

02:02:26.372 --> 02:02:27.640
AND OVERSIGHT FOR PROVIDERS AND

02:02:27.707 --> 02:02:28.607

02:02:33.679 --> 02:02:35.181
LACK OF CONSISTENCY ENERGIZED

02:02:35.247 --> 02:02:36.382
GREEN DATA COLLECTED ACROSS

02:02:36.449 --> 02:02:37.650
EARLY DEDICATION AYE

02:02:37.717 --> 02:02:39.251
INTERVENTION SYSTEMS EXISTS

02:02:39.318 --> 02:02:40.653
WELL AND THEN FOR THE LINKAGES

02:02:40.720 --> 02:02:42.755
TO SERVICES WE HAVE A REALLY

02:02:42.822 --> 02:02:45.024
FRAGMENTED SERVICE SYSTEM IN

02:02:45.091 --> 02:02:45.791
COMPLEX ELIGIBILITY AND

02:02:45.858 --> 02:02:47.560
REFERRAL PROCESSES. THAT MAKES

02:02:47.626 --> 02:02:48.828
IT DIFFICULT TO MATCH

02:02:48.894 --> 02:02:49.895
IDENTIFIED NEEDS WITH

02:02:49.962 --> 02:02:51.764
APPROPRIATE REFERRALS AND THEN

02:02:51.831 --> 02:02:52.732
THE REFERRALS AND LINKAGES TO

02:02:52.798 --> 02:02:54.633
EARLY INTERVENTION SERVICES ARE

02:02:54.700 --> 02:02:56.402
OFTEN UNSUCCESSFUL BECAUSE OF

02:02:56.469 --> 02:02:57.937
LIMITED SERVICES IN ANY GIVEN

02:02:58.003 --> 02:03:00.239
COMMUNITY TO ADDRESS THE CHILD

02:03:00.306 --> 02:03:01.741
IN FAMILIES UNIQUE NEEDS SO

02:03:01.807 --> 02:03:05.044
NETWORK ADEQUACY IS ANOTHER

02:03:05.111 --> 02:03:05.578
CONCERN. GOT IT THANK YOU.

02:03:05.644 --> 02:03:12.952
ADDITIONAL TESTIMONY. GOOD

02:03:13.018 --> 02:03:13.586
MORNING OUTS TO CAPRI ON BEHALF

02:03:13.652 --> 02:03:14.620
OF FOR SIDE CALIFORNIA. AS

02:03:14.687 --> 02:03:15.087
WE'VE HEARD TODAY THE

02:03:15.154 --> 02:03:16.088
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR EARLY

02:03:16.155 --> 02:03:17.189
START SERVICES IS TOO HIGH IN

02:03:17.256 --> 02:03:18.557
CALIFORNIA AND FAR ABOVE THAT

02:03:18.624 --> 02:03:20.326
OF MOST OTHER STATES. THIS HAS

02:03:20.392 --> 02:03:21.827
MAJOR CONSEQUENCES FOR FAMILIES

02:03:21.894 --> 02:03:23.162
PARTICULARLY THOSE WITH

02:03:23.229 --> 02:03:24.230
CHILDREN WHO HAVE MILD TO

02:03:24.296 --> 02:03:25.931
MODERATE DEVELOPMENTAL DELAYS.

02:03:25.998 --> 02:03:27.133
SO FOR CHILDREN WITH MILD TO

02:03:27.199 --> 02:03:28.734
MODERATE DELAYS EVEN LIGHT

02:03:28.801 --> 02:03:29.935
TOUCH APPROACHES CAN HELP

02:03:30.002 --> 02:03:31.604
RETURN THEM TO AN OPTICAL PATH

02:03:31.670 --> 02:03:32.705
FOR DEVELOPMENT AND THE PROCESS

02:03:32.772 --> 02:03:34.106
OF WAITING THE NEED FOR MORE

02:03:34.173 --> 02:03:34.707
COSTLY INTERVENTIONS

02:03:34.774 --> 02:03:36.642
INTERVENTIONS LATER IN LIFE.

02:03:36.709 --> 02:03:38.277
IMPORTANTLY EARLY INTERVENTION

02:03:38.344 --> 02:03:39.311
IS MORE EFFECTIVE THAN A WAIT

02:03:39.378 --> 02:03:41.413
AND SEE APPROACH PRECISELY

02:03:41.480 --> 02:03:42.014
BECAUSE THE ABILITY TO CHANGE

02:03:42.081 --> 02:03:43.816
BEHAVIOR DECREASED SAYS THAT

02:03:43.883 --> 02:03:44.850
THE CHILD GROWS OLDER AND BRAIN

02:03:44.917 --> 02:03:47.052
DEVELOPMENT SLOWS. ADDITIONALLY

02:03:47.119 --> 02:03:48.687
AND MORE BROADLY CALIFORNIA'S

02:03:48.754 --> 02:03:49.822
EARLY IDENTIFICATION

02:03:49.889 --> 02:03:50.756
INTERVENTION SYSTEM IS

02:03:50.823 --> 02:03:52.458
FRAGMENTED UNDER RESOURCE AND

02:03:52.525 --> 02:03:54.059
LACKING THE CAPACITY NECESSARY

02:03:54.126 --> 02:03:56.695
TO ADEQUATELY SERVE CHILDREN.

02:03:56.762 --> 02:03:57.363
PARENTS HAVE DIFFICULTY

02:03:57.429 --> 02:03:59.331

ELIGIBLE FOR AS WE'VE HEARD

02:04:01.233 --> 02:04:02.701
TODAY AND THAT'S DIFFICULT IT

02:04:02.768 --> 02:04:03.636
CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO A FEW

02:04:03.702 --> 02:04:05.337
DIFFERENT THINGS. ONE THE

02:04:05.404 --> 02:04:06.338

NAVIGATING ON THEIR OWN SO THE

NOTIFY FAMILIES ABOUT SERVICES

02:25:43.968 --> 02:25:44.836
DISCUSSIONS WILL CONTINUE TO

02:25:44.902 --> 02:25:47.905
HAVE YOU KNOW I APPRECIATE THE

02:25:47.972 --> 02:25:48.906
TESTIMONY OF BREAKING DOWN

02:25:48.973 --> 02:25:51.175
BARRIERS AND SILOS. I THINK

02:25:51.242 --> 02:25:52.110
IT'S ONLY THROUGH AN INTEGRATED

02:25:52.176 --> 02:25:54.345
APPROACH THAT WERE REALLY GOING

02:25:54.412 --> 02:25:56.147
TO HOLISTICALLY HELP FAMILIES

02:25:56.214 --> 02:25:58.649
IN THESE CHILDREN. WE GET WEIRD.

02:25:58.716 --> 02:25:59.951
FROM THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS AS

02:26:00.017 --> 02:26:00.885
WELL SOME OF THE WORK THAT

02:26:00.952 --> 02:26:02.753
THEY'VE DONE ON THE BLUE RIBBON

02:26:02.820 --> 02:26:03.688
COMMISSION AND SOME OF THE

02:26:03.754 --> 02:26:05.456
FINDINGS THERE. I THINK FROM

02:26:05.523 --> 02:26:06.624
EACH EVEN ALL THE PUBLIC

02:26:06.691 --> 02:26:08.259
COMMENT IS THE NEED FOR

02:26:08.326 --> 02:26:09.427
RESOURCES THEY NEED TO TACKLE

02:26:09.494 --> 02:26:11.829
THIS. I THERE IS PROBABLY NO

02:26:11.896 --> 02:26:13.464
PERFECT WAY TO TACKLE IT SO I

02:26:13.531 --> 02:26:15.967
GET THE PRIORITIES BUT- MAYBE.

02:26:16.033 --> 02:26:16.934
DIFFERENT POTS OF MONEY BECOME

02:26:17.001 --> 02:26:18.169
AVAILABLE AT DIFFERENT TIMES

02:26:18.236 --> 02:26:19.837
AND MAYBE THAT'S HOW WE JUST

02:26:19.904 --> 02:26:20.738
START TACKLING IT FROM EVERY

02:26:20.805 --> 02:26:23.040
ANGLE THAT WE CAN. BUT IT

02:26:23.107 --> 02:26:24.542
TRYING TO KEEP IN MIND THAT THE
