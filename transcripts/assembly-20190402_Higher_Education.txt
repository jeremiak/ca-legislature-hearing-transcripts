PER CAPITA THAN ANY OTHER REGION OF THE STATE. ACCORDING TO THE CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION. IN PRIMARY CARE CARE SPECIALIST ALONE. MANY CALIFORNIA COUNTIES HAVE FAR FEWER THAN SIXTY TO EIGHTY PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS PER ONE THOUSAND PEOPLE. CONSIDERED SUFFICIENT TO MEET THE MAN. IN THE INLAND EMPIRE. THERE ARE A MERE THIRTY FIVE PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS PER ONE THOUSAND PEOPLE. STUDIES SHOW THAT THE GREATEST INDICATORS OF WHERE PHYSICIANS PRACTICE IS WHERE THEY GROW UP. ADD OR COMPLETE THEIR MEDICAL TRAINING. THUS A MEDICAL SCHOOL WITH ASSOCIATED RESIDENCY TRAINING PROGRAMS IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE MEANS OF ADDRESSING THE REGION'S DOCTOR SHORTAGE. THE MISSION OF THE UC RIVERSIDE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE. IS TO IMPROVE THE HEALTH. THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA AND TO SERVE THE INLAND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. BY TRAINING A DIVERSE WORK FORCE OF PHYSICIANS. AND BY DEVELOPING IN A VERY INNOVATIVE RESEARCH AND HEALTH CARE DELIVERY PROGRAMS. pAND ROLLED AND IT'S A KNACK INAUGURAL CLASS. OF AUGUST. TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN AND WILL GRADUATE ITS THIRD CLASS IN MAY OF THIS YEAR. THE CURRENT FACILITY. AND COMMITMENT OF STATE RESOURCES DOES NOT PROVIDE FOR ADEQUATE STAFFING. TEACHING FACULTY OR STUDENT STUDY. TEACHING AND ADMINISTRATIVE SPACE. EXPANSION OF THE UC OUR SCHOOL OF MEDICINE FACILITY. IS URGENTLY REQUIRED IN ORDER TO ACCOMMODATE THE PLANNED GROWTH. OF UP TO FIVE HUNDRED PHYSICIANS IN TRAINING. THEIR BY INCREASING THE SUPPLY OF PHYSICIANS AND UNDERSERVED AREAS OF THE STATE. AND THE STATE'S ANNUAL FUNDING APPROPRIATION. MUST BE INCREASED IN ORDER TO SUPPORT THE CURRENT AND FUTURE. YOU SEE ARE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE OPERATION. HERE WITH ME TODAY ON BEHALF OF ASSEMBLY BILL.

THE COMMUNITY OF FUTURE POSITIONS THAT WE ARE TRAINING. AND MORE THAN 80% ARE PURSUING RESIDENCY TRAINING IN CALIFORNIA. WITH MORE THAN TWO THIRDS REMAINING IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND NEARLY A THIRD IN THE INLAND EMPIRE -- INLAND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. YOU SEE ARE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE IS UNDER FUNDED. AS SUCH. THE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE LACKS THE RESOURCES TO FULLY MEET THE NEEDS OF THE MEDICAL SCHOOL. THE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN MEDICAL COLLEGES. ACES OUR MEDICAL SCHOOL IN THE BOTTOM TWENTY FIRST PERCENT HOUSE. AMONG PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN TERMS OF ESTIMATED STATE FUNDING. DUE TO ALL UNDER FUNDED STATUS. THE UC OUR MEDICAL SCHOOL IS HE SENSUALLY. AT SEVEN CAP THAT SEVENTY INCOMING STUDENTS EACH YEAR. MOST MEDICAL SCHOOLS AND ROLL MORE THAN A HUNDRED STUDENTS EACH YEAR. THEREFORE IT IS ESSENTIAL. WHERE YOU SEE OUR OF MEDICAL SCHOOL TO GROW TO MEET THE PHYSICIAN WORKFORCE NEEDS OF CALIFORNIANS? THE FUNDING NEEDS OUTLINED IN AB.

SEVENTEEN FORTY I AM PLEASED TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION NEXT WITNESS. THANK YOU DEAN DAYS AND THANK YOU TO YOU AS WELL -- HONORABLE CHAIR SIMILAR RADINA AND THE REST OF THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- MY NAME IS FRANCISCO FORTY S. AND I AM CURRENTLY A FOURTH YEAR MEDICAL STUDENT AT THE UC OUR SCHOOL OF MEDICINE. I'M OFTEN ASKED THE QUESTION. WHY DID I CHOOSE TO PURSUE MEDICINE? FOR MY PASSION DESIRE TO PURSUE A MEDICAL DEGREE STEMS BACK. TO ONE PHYSICIAN. TYPICALLY THIS WAS OUR PRIMARY CARE DOCTOR. WHO FOR SO MANY YEARS DISPLAYED A LEVEL OF COMPASSION WHEN TREATING MY MOTHER? YOU HAVE TO LIVE WITH A VERY CHRONIC AND DEBILITATING CONDITION [inaudible] AND THIS CONDITION OFTEN LEFT HER FEELING VERY HOPELESS AND AND DESOLATE AT TIMES. HOWEVER WITNESSING MY PHYSICIAN'S ABILITY TO SPEAK OUR NATIVE LANGUAGE. UNDERSTAND MY MOTHER'S FORTUNATELY. AND SEEING HIM RESTORE HOPE WHERE THERE WAS ONCE NONE. LEFT IN ON IMMEASURABLE IMPACT ON MY LIFE. AND FROM THAT POINT MOVING FORWARD AND YOU WHAT TYPE OF PHYSICIAN I WANTED TO BE. THE KIND OF DOCTOR WHO WAS BOTH CULTURALLY COMPETENT AND COMPASSIONATE. AND WHO NOT ONLY RELIED ON MEDICINE TO BRING HEALING BUT COULD ALSO USE A GENTLE WORD AND THAT KIND TOUCH IS PART OF HIS ARSENAL. I CAN DECLARE WITH GREAT PRIDE THAT YOU SEE ARE IN PART OF A DIVERSE. GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO ARE ALL STRIVING TO IMPROVE THE HEALTH OF OUR NEIGHBORING COMMUNITIES. BUT DO NOT TAKE MY WORD FOR IT THE NUMBERS SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES. REPRESENTED IN MEDICINE. 564% OF OUR CLASSES COMPRISE THE FUTURE WOMEN DOCTORS. AND 40% OF MY COLLEAGUES HEALTH FROM EITHER EDUCATIONALLY AND OR SOCIAL ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED BACKGROUNDS. AND I BELIEVE THAT THE DIVERSE WORKFORCE IS ESSENTIAL TO MEETING THE VERY HEALTHCARE NEEDS. OF THE INLAND REGION IN CALIFORNIA AT LARGE. CURRENTLY I AM PURSUING A RESIDENCY IN GENERAL INTERNAL MEDICINE TO BUILD MEANINGFUL AND LASTING RELATIONSHIPS WITH MY PATIENTS. IN MY COMMUNITY AS WELL. AS I DISCOVER THROUGHOUT MY FOUR YEARS OF HIGH CALIBER MEDICAL EDUCATION AT UC RIVERSIDE. THIS IS TRULY THE ESSENCE OF MY CHOI IN MEDICINE. MORE IMPORTANTLY I WANT AND I'M MORE THAN READY TO TO SERVE IN THE INLAND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA REGION. WHICH IS AND WILL FOREVER REMAIN MY HOPE. SO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE MY EXPERIENCE AND I URGE THE COMMITTEE TO SUPPORT ASSEMBLY BILL SEVENTEEN FORTY TO HELP US CONTINUE TO BUILD THE NEXT GENERATION OF PHYSICIANS.

A FEE A FILING FEE A PRETTY SIGNATURES FROM THE COMMUNITY THAT THEY'RE SEEKING TO REPRESENT IN FACT ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES HERE ON THIS DIES TODAY YOU HAD TO PAY A FILING FEE. OUR GATHER UP TO THREE THOUSAND SIGNATURES NOT ONLY DEMONSTRATE OUR COMMITMENT TO THE OPPORTUNITY TO SERVE -- BUT ALSO THE SUPPORT THAT WE HAD FROM OUR DISTRICTS AND THE CITY OF COMMITTEE BECAUSE DISTRICT BOARD AS WELL AS THE GROSS MONTHLY MARKET COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT BOARD. THE SIMPLE DEMOCRATIC REQUIREMENTS DO NOT EXIST AB ELEVEN FIFTY ADDRESSES THIS BY REQUIRING CANDIDATES FOR THE GOVERNING BOARDS OF BOTH OF THESE COMMITTEE BECAUSE DISTRICTS TO COLLECT AT LEAST ONE HUNDRED SIGNATURES OF VOTERS. IN THEIR TRUSTY AREA TO IN SUPPORT OF THE CANDIDACY IN ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR THE BALLOT. COLLECTING SIGNATURES IS A COMMON SENSE IN DEMOCRATIC WAY TO DEMONSTRATE COMMUNITY SUPPORT ENSURE THE CANDID SEEKING PUBLIC OFFICE HAVE SUPPORT IN THEIR DISTRICTS THAT THEY'RE SEEKING TO REPRESENT. WITH ME THIS AFTERNOON OR TWO WITNESSES A BRIAN HOT WITH THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS FEDERATION AND JIM MILLER ON BEHALF OF THE A. F. T. LOCAL NINETEEN THIRTY ONE I'D LIKE TO MOVE THE BILL. THIS CHAIR MEMBER BRIAN HOW WITH THE CALIFORNIA FEDERATION OF TEACHERS WERE PROP SPONSORS OF THIS LEGISLATION. BOB I KNOW YOU HAVE A BUSY HEARING TODAY SO I'M GOING TO YIELD MY TIME TO OUR EXPERT WITNESS TESTIMONY. JIM MAILER NOT SUCH AN EXPERT -- PRESIDENT OF AMERICAN FEDERATION OF TEACHERS GO LOCAL -- NINETEEN THIRTY ONE AT THE AUTHORED POINTED OUT VERY ELOQUENTLY AT THE BILL'S PRETTY SIMPLE AND PRETTY STRAIGHT FORWARD IT JUST MAKES IT A LITTLE BIT MORE DEMOCRATIC FOR PEOPLE THAT WANT TO RUN FOR A SEAT ON ONE OF THE COLLEGE BOARDS -- THE K. TWELVE DISTRICTS AND THE UNION SENATE GO UNIFIED THAT WE CAME OUT OF SO HAS THE HUNDRED SIGNATURE REQUIREMENT FOR SOME REASON WHEN WE LEFT THEM WE LOST THAT SO. BASICALLY JUST PUTTING THAT BACK IN PLACE TO MIRROR WHAT THE UNIFIED DISTRICT AS AN HUNDRED SIGNATURES ISN'T SUCH A HIGH BAR BUT IT DOES DEMONSTRATE AT LEAST A SMALL. AMOUNT OF THAT COMMITMENT FOR PEOPLE THAT WANT TO RUN FOR THE SEATS. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU CHAIR MEMBERS MARK MCDONALD ON BEHALF OF THE SAN DIEGO COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT IN SUPPORT [inaudible] THANK YOU. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION ANY TWEETERS. AS A NUN ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU CHAIR AWESOME AND ONE OF GLORIA -- WILL BE SUPPORTING -- MOST LIKELY BUT I HAVE A CURIOUS -- QUESTION I I KNOW THIS IS A COMMON PRACTICE ABOUT THE REQUIRING HUNDRED SIGNATURES SO WHEN NOT REQUIRING. WHAT DIFFERENCES HAVE DOES A MAKE UP I NóI -- THEY EXPERIENCE A CANDIDATE THE COLLECTING THE SIGNATURES IS ADJUSTABLE. PAIN IN ALL BUT THAT DOESN'T DETER -- FROM THAT SERIOUS A CANDIDATE TO COLLECT THEM BUT WHAT THE ANY ON SIRIUS PEOPLE BECAUSE OF WHAT THIS -- REQUIREMENT -- THE THE NEVER FILED OUT WHAT WHAT IS A STACK THE PURPOSE OF REQUIRING THIS A SIGNATURE SAID NOW SO. IN ALL MY QUESTION. THIS IS TO SHOW THAT THAT -- POTENTIAL CANDIDATE ACTUALLY HAVE SUPPORT SUPPORT IN THE AREA TO LOOKING TO REPRESENT -- IT'S NOT AND DO BURDEN WE HAVE TO SUPPLY MANY MORE THOUSANDS IF WE WANTED SEEK. THE LEGISLATIVE SEATS -- BUT IT IS A SENSE OF MAKING SURE THAT THESE ARE NOT FOLKS -- TO TO SORT OF JUMP IN -- TO RACE BUT THEY HAVE SOME DEMONSTRATED ABILITY TO TELL AT LEAST A HUNDRED THEIR CONSTITUENTS CONVINCE A HUNDRED THEIR CONSTITUENTS TO PUT THEIR NAME ON A PETITION. SAYING THAT THEY ARE WORTHY PUBLIC OFFICE AND THEY COULD HAVE SOME POTENTIAL SUPPORT -- IF THEY RICHARD IF THEY CHOSE TO RUN. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE [inaudible] SEEING NONE -- I I I WOULD WANT TO ADD THAT. HAVING BEEN A COMMUNITY COLLEGE CHRISTY MYSELF I THINK THAT ONE HUNDRED SIGNATURES IS A VERY GOOD IDEA. I'VE SEEN IN MY OWN DISTRICT -- OF TRYING TO REMEMBER YOU KNOW PEOPLE WITH FLASHY NAMES AT NAMES THAT. MAYBE YOU RECOGNIZE TO THE PUBLIC BUT IT'S NOT THEM -- RUN AND SOMETIMES WHEN. AND SO -- HUNDRED SIGNATURES I THINK WOULD KIND OF STOP THOSE KIND OF THINGS FROM HAPPENING. AND WOULD BE A GOOD SHOW OF MINIMAL SUPPORT SO I SUPPORT YOUR BILL. SO WE HAD A MOTION BY MISTER LEVINE A SECOND BY MISTER LOWE AND MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION IS DUE PASSED TO THE ELECTIONS AND REDISTRICTING COMMITTEE. MEDINA HI MEDINA I CHOI. CHOI I JONES SAWYER [inaudible] BLOOM. BLOOM I GABRIEL. GABRIEL I IRWIN -- WHEN I KILEY? LEVINE. LEVINE I LOW. LOW I PATTERSON SANTIAGO WEBER WEBER I EIGHT ZERO BILL IS OUT WE'LL KEEP IT OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS BIGGEST GERMAN THANK YOU. GOING NOW BACK -- TO SIGN IN ORDER MISTER BERMAN -- FILE ITEM FOR WELCOME. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN COLLEAGUES. HOUSING AND FOOD AND SECURITY AMONG COLLEGE STUDENTS ALSO KNOWN AS BASIC NEEDS AND SECURITY. IS FINALLY GETTING THE ATTENTION IT DESERVES. STUDENTS OF COLOR FIRST GENERATION COLLEGE STUDENTS FINANCIAL AID RECIPIENTS AND FORMER FOSTER YOUTH ARE AT MUCH HIGHER RISK OF EXPERIENCING BASIC NEEDS AND SECURITY. THE MOST EXTREME FORM OF HOUSING AND SECURITY IS HOMELESSNESS THEN AT IT HAS A DIRECT IMPACT ON THE STUDENT'S ACADEMIC SUCCESS. A RECENT REPORT RELEASED BY THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE IN THE HOPE CENTER FOR COLLEGE COMMUNITY AND JUSTICE. WHICH SURVEYED NEARLY FORTY THOUSAND STUDENTS AT FIFTY SEVEN COMMUNITY COLLEGES FOUND THAT HOMELESSNESS IN THE PRIOR YEAR. IF YOU EXTRAPOLATE THAT TO CALIFORNIA'S COMMUNITY COLLEGE POPULATION OF TWO POINT ONE MILLION STUDENTS. THIS MEANS THAT BARELY LESS THAN FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND STUDENTS STATEWIDE HAVE EXPERIENCE HOMELESSNESS IN THE LAST YEAR. THIS NUMBER IS NOT ONLY SHOCKING AN ALARMING AND TRAGIC BUT IT'S A CALL TO ACTION. THIS IS WHY I INTRODUCED AB THREE OH TWO WHICH WOULD REQUIRE COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO GRANT OVERNIGHT ACCESS TO THE PARKING FACILITIES FOR HOMELESS STUDENTS TO SLEEP IN THEIR VEHICLES. EXISTING LAW ALREADY REQUIRES COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO GRANT HOMELESS STUDENTS ACCESS TO CAMPUS SHOWER FACILITIES. THIS BILL IS THE NEXT LOGICAL STEP IN HELPING OUR HOMELESS STUDENTS. UNDER AB THREE OR TWO EACH COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT WILL BE PROVIDED BROAD FLEXIBILITY TO DEVELOPING AN IMPLEMENTATION PLAN THAT MEETS THE LOCAL NEEDS AND CIRCUMSTANCES. AB THREE OH TWO ALSO IMPORTANTLY SPECIFIES THAT IT IS THE INTENT OF THE LEGISLATURE THAT HOMELESS STUDENTS TO USE THE OVERNIGHT PARKING FACILITIES THE CONNECTED TO AVAILABLE STATE. COUNTY COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT AND COMMUNITY BASED HOUSING FOOD AND FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE RESOURCES. THE GOAL ISN'T TO TO HAVE COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS OR REALLY ANYBODY SLEEP IN THEIR VEHICLES. WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO PROVIDE HOUSING FOR RESIDENTS AT EVERY INCOME LEVEL. FOR FAR AWAY FROM THAT GOAL IN CALIFORNIA TODAY. THE REALITY IS THAT STUDENTS ARE SLEEPING IN THEIR VEHICLES RIGHT NOW. AND WHEN WE DON'T PROVIDE A SAFE PLACE FOR THEM TO SLEEP WE FORCE THEM INTO THE SHADOWS IN A DARK ALLEYS AND INDUSTRIAL PARKS WHERE THE WHERE THEY ARE MOST VULNERABLE. MAKE NO MISTAKE AB THREE OR TWO IS NOT A SOLUTION TO THE HOMELESSNESS CRISIS. BUILDING MORE HOUSING IS. BUT THAT WILL TAKE YEARS AND IN THE MEANTIME THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS RIGHT NOW TONIGHT. AND WE SHOULD DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO MAKE THEIR SITUATION A LITTLE BIT BETTER. THIS IS WHAT AB THREE OH TWO DOES. IT MEETS THEIR MEDIA NEEDS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. AND WITH ME TO TESTIFY -- ARE MATTHEW BUT IS STUDENT AT FOOTHILL COLLEGE ANTHONY WHITE THE SECOND A STUDENT AT PALOMAR COLLEGE AND TO HEAR A HYATT DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA HOMELESS YOUTH PROJECT. AND THEY WILL MAKE SURE TO STAY WITHIN THE FOUR MINUTES YES SIR THANK YOU. NOT THE ONE IS ALL AGAIN A MATH DEVOTO I'M A THIRD YEAR FOOTHILL COLLEGE STUDENT I SPENT ABOUT TWO YEARS. HOMELESS PRIMARILY SLEEPING MY CAR WILL COUCHSURFING TRYING TO FIND A STABLE PLACE TO LIVE. DURING THAT TIME I WAS NOT ONLY A FULL TIME STUDENT BUT I WORK FULL TIME. WITH SOME SOME WEEKS LOOKING LIKE FOURTEEN ARE SCHOOL DAYS. THIRTEEN ARE WORK DAYS -- I WASN'T WELCOME TO SLEEP ON CAMPUS THERE NEAR THE RESOURCES THAT COMMUNITY COLLEGES PROVIDE LIKE SHOWERS. THAT I NEEDED TO USE EVERY MORNING BEFORE WORK OR SCHOOL. AND WAS FORCED TO GO OFF CAMPUS IN THE COMMUNITY NEARBY WHERE IT WAS ILLEGAL TO PARK OVERNIGHT. I CHORUS TICKETED AND VANDALIZED -- AND BECAUSE OF THAT ENDED UP PARKING FURTHER AND FURTHER AWAY FROM CAMPUS TO TRY AND FIND A SAFE PLACE TO PARK. WHICH CUT INTO THE VERY LIMITED TIME THAT I HAVE FOR THINGS SUCH AS SLEEP AND TAKING CARE OF MYSELF ON TOP OF WORKING. AND BEING A STUDENT. THERE THERE PLENTY OF STUDENTS THAT ARE IN NEED OF THIS ASSEMBLY BILL. AND MANY OF THE STUDENTS THAT ARE HOMELESS OR TRYING TO TEN AND EDUCATION TO ESCAPE FROM POVERTY AND HOMELESSNESS SO ANYTHING THAT WE CAN DO TO HELP THEM. ESPECIALLY NOW. SUCH AS THIS BILL IS. MUCH NEEDED. THANK YOU THANK YOU MATHIS. HELLO MY NAME'S ANTHONY WHITE -- I'M TWENTY YEARS OLD I'M A MARINE CORPS VETERAN STUDENT A FATHER A HUSBAND. I'M ALSO FORMALLY HOMELESS I SAID ABOUT EIGHT MONTHS LIVING IN MY TRUCK -- POST MARINE CORPS -- UNFORTUNATELY I DISSENT I'M A FULL TIME FATHER -- BUT I HAD TO SEND MY SON OUT OF STATE TO LIVE WITH HIS MOTHER IS A SINCE CAME APPARENT THAT MICE LIVING SITUATION WASN'T GONNA BE. STABLE ENOUGH FOR HIM. SO -- EIGHT MONTHS WENT BY I WAS GOING TO SCHOOL WHILE WORKING FULL TIME JOURNALIST MYSELF UP OUT OF THE SITUATION TO BE WILL HAVE MY SON BACK WITH ME. TO A MAKE SURE MY FAMILIES BACK TOGETHER AND WE'RE GONNA -- TO BETTER FOR OURSELVES AND FORTUNATELY IT WAS NOT A LOT ACCESS OR AT LEAST -- IT WAS AN ADVERTISER YOU KNOW MADE AVAILABLE ACCESS TO RESOURCES THAT COULD HELP ME GET OUT OF THE SITUATION A LOT SOONER. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES YOU KNOW A LOT OF FOOD PANTRIES ARE IN PLACE A LOT OF? YOU KNOW GOOD EFFORTS ARE MADE BUT HOMELESSNESS IS ONE OF THOSE ISSUES THAT HASN'T BEEN ADDRESSED AS MUCH AS IT SHOULD BE. AND THE RECENT HOPE LAB STUDY THAT CAME OUT IN MARCH YOU KNOW GIVES THE SPECIFIC DATA THAT SHOWS ABOUT 20% OF STUDENTS. HAS ASSEMBLYMAN BERMAN MENTION ARE FACING HOMELESSNESS THAT'S NOT HOUSING SECURE HOMES ON THE STREET WERE LIVING IN THEIR CAR HOMELESS WITH NO SICK ROOF OVER THEIR HEAD. I WAS ONE OF THAT 20%. OF THAT OUR CITY OF THAT 19% 20% OF STUDENTS SO ABOUT EIGHT EIGHTY THOUSAND STUDENTS ARE SLEEPING IN THE CARS RIGHT NOW. YOU DIVIDE THAT ACROSS ALL THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES ALL HUNDRED FOURTEEN OF THEM WHAT SEVEN HUNDRED STUDENTS AT EACH COLLEGE CAMPUS HER RIGHT NOW LIVING IN THEIR CARS. ARE NOT ABLE TO HAVE A SAFE PLACE TO SLEEP AT NIGHT OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE FOR ME WAS WHERE MY GONNA SLEEP. ON PARK IN FRONT OF LOWS BECAUSE THEIR WIFI REACHES ALL THE WAY OUT IN THE PARKING LOT A PARKING BEHIND INDUSTRIAL CENTERS BECAUSE THEIR PRIVATE I'M NOT GONNA BE DISTURBED. I IF I LOST MY VEHICLE AS MATT MENTIONED YOU KNOW IT'S CRIMINAL AND A LOT OF PLACES TO BE LIVING IN YOUR CAR AND HAD I LOST MY VEHICLE WITH A LOSS MEANS TRANSPORTATION. TO WORK TO SCHOOL WHICH ULTIMATELY HAD WITHDRAWAL FROM SCHOOL JUST BECAUSE I COULDN'T KEEP THE CHALLENGE OUT. OF TRYING. TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN MY CLASSES AND THEN YOU KNOW FROM SIX TO NINE PM GOING TO NIGHT SCHOOL AND LEAVING AND HAVING TO FIGURE OUT WHERE MY GONNA GO AT NIGHT WHERE MY GOING TO BE SAFE FOR MY NOT GONNA BE HARASSED WOMEN NOT GONNA COST TROUBLE. YOU KNOW AND I FEEL THAT AB THREE OH TWO HAD BEEN IN PLACE OF THE TIME. I WOULD'VE BEEN ABLE -- TO GET SUPPORT SOONER -- THANK PLEASE A BETTER ACCESS TO RESOURCES THAT MOST STUDENTS DON'T -- YOU KNOW I WAS ABLE TO LEAN ON THOSE RESOURCES -- YOU KNOW AFTER THAT EIGHT MONTH PERIOD TO GET MYSELF OUT OF THAT SITUATION BUT I CAN IMAGINE IF I WASN'T A VETERAN I MIGHT STILL BE IN THAT SITUATION I AM NOW THANKFULLY THAT WAS FOUR YEARS AGO I HAD MY SON A WITH ME FULL TIME. WITH A ROOF OVER OUR HEADS I'M BACK IN SCHOOL PALOMAR WITH STERN GOVERNMENT NOTE -- AND YOU KNOW IT'S ONE OF THOSE STORIES THAT YOU LOOK BACK ON YOU SAY THAT WOULD HAPPEN TO ME OR YOU KNOW YOU DON'T THINK IT'S RELATABLE BUT THEN IT HAPPENS TO YOU HAPPENS TO OUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS OUR SONS AND DAUGHTERS. THAT'S WHY I URGE YOU YOU KNOW -- TO PLEASE SUPPORT AB THREE OH TWO NOT JUST FOR POLITICS IS NOT JUST ETHICALLY RESPONSIBLE PLEASE FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE WITH THE CALIFORNIA COMMITTEE BECAUSE FUNDING FORMULA BASED ON SUCCESS OF STUDENTS NOW SHE WAS ARE GONNA BE SUCCESSFUL IF THEY'RE HUNGRY FOR HOMELESS. SO I URGE YOU TO PLEASE SUPPORT EIGHTY THREE OH TWO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IF I COULD SAY TO THE LAST WITNESS IF YOU COULD LIMITED TO AFTERNOON TERRY MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MANY MISSION HER HIGH AND I'M THE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA HOMELESS YOUTH PROJECT. ON THIS BILLS IMPORTANT STEP TOWARD PROVIDING SAFE SPACE FOR STUDENTS USING A HARM REDUCTION PHILOSOPHY WHICH IS A BEST PRACTICE IN THE FIELD OF YOUTH HOMELESSNESS. WE HAVE NUMBERS OF STUDENT HOMELESSNESS AS HIGH AS WE DO WE SHOULD HAVE A BIAS TOWARD ACTION. IT IS ALSO AN OPPORTUNITY CONNECT THESE STUDENTS TO THE COLLEGE HOMELESS LEASE ON ON CAMPUS SO THEY CAN MORE EFFECTIVELY BE REFERRED TO HOUSING AND OTHER SUPPORT OF SERVICES. A NEW STATE REPORT FOUND THAT THE RATE THAT LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ARE PROVING LOW INCOME HOUSING. MOST COUNTIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA WON'T REACH THEIR OWN HOUSING GOALS FOR DECADES. IT'S ALSO TRUE THAT MOST CITIES ACROSS THE STATE IT IS ILLEGAL TO SLEEP IN A PARKED VEHICLE OVERNIGHT BUT WE KNOW THAT MANY STUDENTS ARE PUT IN THAT POSITION. WE DON'T WANT STUDENTS TO BE CRIMINALIZED FOR THEIR LACK OF HOUSING ESPECIALLY WILL TRYING TO ATTEND COLLEGE FOR THESE REASONS WE APPLAUD SUMMER BERMAN THE TENSIONS TO BETTER SERVICE DIDN'T COMMUNITY HAPPEN ANSWER QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE THANK YOU.

TO HELP THESE STUDENTS THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS THAT ARE HOMELESS IS -- THAT WITH THAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE LATEST STATE IS ABSOLUTELY APPALLING -- I AM NOT GOING -- TO I I HOPE TO VOTE FOR THIS BILL ON THE FLOOR AND I'M NOT GOING TO SUPPORT RIGHT NOW AND I WANT -- TO LAY OUT SOME OF MY CONCERNS AFTER I HAVE TALKED. TO PEOPLE IN MY DISTRICT AND AND I THINK A LOT OF THEM WERE BROUGHT UP ALREADY. FIRST ONE IS FUNDING WE WANT TO ABSOLUTELY MAKE SURE THAT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE REIMBURSED -- FOR THIS COST -- THEY ARE READY -- DEALING WITH A LOT OF FUNDING GAPS AND WE DON'T WANT TO TAKE ANYTHING AWAY FROM OTHER PROGRAMS -- SECURITY WAS MENTIONED ALSO -- I DON'T THINK THAT THAT WAS THE AMENDMENTS THAT YOU TOOK I DON'T THINK THAT WE'VE THAT DEALT WITH GET WITH SECURITY -- THEM. I'D LIKE TO ALSO SEE -- SUNSET. AND AN EVALUATION OF THE PROGRAM. AND AND YOU KNOW MAKE SURE TO DEAL WITH THE LIABILITY ISSUES SO THAT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES STONE AND UP HOLDING THE BAG ON THIS BUT I THINK THIS IS. GOV THIS IS IT'S WE HAVE SUCH A HUGE PROBLEM HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND I THINK THIS IS A CREATIVE WAY TO DEAL WITH THAT. I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S COMPLETELY WELL THOUGHT OUT THAT WE DON'T. IMPACTS. THE THE COLLEGES AND THAT WE DON'T IMPACT NEIGHBORHOODS AND THAT WE DON'T END UP WITH STUDENTS IN A WORSE SITUATION THAN THEY WOULD BE OTHERWISE SO AGAIN -- WANT TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH YOU ON THIS AND AND HOPE TO SUPPORT YOU ON THE FLOOR THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER WHEN AND AND APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATIONS WE'VE HAD -- IN OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS AND AND I'M SURE AND THE PUSH IT YOU PROVIDING YOUR CONCERNS YEAH YOU KNOW TO ME AHEAD OF TIME AND WILL KEEP ON WORKING TOGETHER THAT TO WORK THROUGH. SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT YOU REST [inaudible] ASSEMBLYMEMBER BLOOM. THANK YOU AND THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER BERMAN -- FOR BRINGING THIS BILL I THINK IT ADDRESSES A VERY -- IMPORTANT ISSUE THAT WE HAVEN'T. SPENT ENOUGH TIME -- THINKING THROUGH -- I SHARE A LOT OF THE CONCERNS OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER -- WHEN -- I'M GONNA REACH A DIFFERENT RESULT HERE TODAY AND RESERVE -- MY THINKING ON THE BILL UNTIL -- IT COMES TO THE FLOOR -- A SEWER -- TAKING A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT APPROACH BUT I THINK THAT MY CONCERNS ARE VERY MUCH REFLECTED IN THE LETTER THAT YOU RECEIVED. FROM SANTA MONICA COLLEGE RIGHT I DO BELIEVE THAT -- WE SHOULD START THIS PROGRAM AS A PERMISSIVE PROGRAM NOT AS A MANDATE -- I THINK THAT THERE ARE SOME -- OTHER CONCERNS THAT ARE IN IN THE LETTER BUT STARTING SOMETHING IS A AS A PILOT WITH A SUNSET SO THAT WE CAN LOOK BACK SEE HOW IT'S WORKING TO ME SEEMS SO. REALLY IMPORTANT HERE. THIS IS SOMETHING OF A YEAR -- YOU'RE KIND OF ASKING TOOK UP PUT A SQUARE PEG IN A ROUND HOLE -- THIS IS NOT THE HOUSING STUDENTS IS NOT A CORE FUNCTION OF OF OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES I THINK IT SHOULD BE FRANKLY I THINK THAT COMMUNITY COLLEGES SHOULD BE. PROVIDING HOUSING -- BUT I HAVE TO SAY -- THIS ALSO ISN'T REALLY HOUSING -- WERE PROVIDING -- UP A PLACE TO PARK A VEHICLE OF I GET VERY UNEASY. WITH PROGRAMS LIKE THIS -- AND THE REASON I GET UNEASY IS BECAUSE A AN AUTOMOBILE -- IS A SUB STANDARD PLACE TO LIVE -- AND WHEN GOVERNMENT -- STEPS IN AND SAYS IT'S OKAY -- UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES AND WILL PROVIDE A PLACE -- BECAUSE THE CRISIS IS SO BAD -- WE BEGIN TO NORMALIZE THAT AND I THINK IT JUST HAS -- IN IN MY EXPERIENCE IN WORKING ON THIS ISSUE LIKE YOU FOR A LONG TIME FOR ME IT'S WELL IN EXCESS OF THIRTY YEARS NOW A LITTLE LONGER THAN I HAVE -- IT GET -- TO I I I I'VE JUST I'VE I'VE BEEN DISTRESSED TO FIND THE HOMELESSNESS HAS GOTTEN WORSE AND WORSE AND WORSE -- AS WE'VE ALLOWED -- THROUGH CONSENT DECREES AND OTHER MEANS -- PEOPLE TO SET UP TENTS AND LIVE ON SIDEWALKS -- I BELIEVE WE'VE NORMALIZE THAT BEHAVIOR AND WE'VE BECOME MORE INURED TO IT AND TO AND THAT'S NOT GOOD NOW I SEE THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ISSUE -- TOO WHICH IS THAT WE HAVE A GROWING HOMELESS POPULATION AND EVEN THOUGH WE'RE HOUSING MORE PEOPLE THAN WE EVER HAVE BEFORE LARGELY BECAUSE OF THE HOUSING CRISIS IN BECAUSE OF RISING SUBSTANCE ABUSE FIRST FOR THE WITH SOME A VERY VERY DANGEROUS CHEMICALS -- AND AND BECAUSE OF INCREASING MENTAL ILLNESS WE SEE THE POPULATION NOT BEING EVEN TO ABLE TO KEEP UP WITH OUR STRIDES IN PROVIDING HOUSING SO THERE THERE'S THERE'S DEFINITELY MULTIPLE SITES TO THIS BUT I I WANT TO MAKE SURE AND TALK ABOUT THAT A NEEDS THAT I HAVE BECAUSE WE SHOULD. NEVER -- THINK ABOUT A PROGRAM LIKE THIS AS PROVIDING OF ANY KIND OF A LONG TERM SOLUTION WHICH IS ONE OF THE REASONS THAT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE A SUNSET WE START SOMETHING LIKE THIS -- AND IT'S GOING TO TAKE ON A LIFE OF ITS OWN. AT LEAST I THINK THAT THAT POTENTIAL IS THERE THE OTHER THING THAT I THINK IS MISSING -- THAT I'D LIKE YOU TO CONSIDER -- IS IF WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A PROGRAM LIKE THIS THEN -- THERE NEEDS TO BE -- ACCESS -- TO AGE APPROPRIATE -- SERVICES -- ON AN ONGOING BASIS. I'M THAT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE PRESENT IN THE BILL RIGHT NOW. ALI CAN LET ME KNOW WHICH SERVICES ARE YOU REFERRING WELL AGE APPROPRIATE -- FOR A TRANSITION H. YOUTH SO -- OKAY YOU KNOW WHAT SPECIFIC SERVICES THOSE WOULD BE -- THAT WRAPAROUND SERVICES ARE TYPICALLY PROVIDING WHATEVER SERVICE A PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL NEEDS BUT AT AN AGE APPROPRIATE LEVEL SO IT MIGHT BE SUBSTANCE ABUSE COUNSELING IT MIGHT BE -- HELP WITH THE PSYCHOLOGICAL PROBLEMS -- IT MIGHT BE -- HELP TO FIND LONG TERM HOUSING IT SHOULD BE HELP TO FIND LONG TERM HOUSING THE THINGS LIKE THAT. THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH AS A MEMBER BLOOM AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON HOUSING ISSUES -- IN THE LEGISLATURE. DO YOU YOU KNOW AS WELL AS ANYBODY THAT WE HAVE A HOMELESSNESS CRISIS -- IN CALIFORNIA AND WE NEED DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF DIFFERENT HOMELESS POPULATIONS -- AND AND I THINK -- AND AN INFINITE NO AND AND CHAIR YOU MIGHT KNOW A LOT ABOUT THE DETAILS OF THE STUDY THAT WAS DONE BUT I I I DON'T KNOW TO WHAT EXTENT -- SUBSTANCE ABUSE IS A PROBLEM. WITH OUR HOMELESS COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS -- I THINK IT'S MORE JUST THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO FIND A PLACE TO LIVE YEAH -- AND AND SO -- BUT BUT PART PART OF THE BILL DOES SAY THAT IT'S INTENT OF THE LEGISLATURE THAT WE CONNECT PEOPLE WITH THE STATE COUNTY COMMUNITY COLLEGE LEVEL AND LOCAL. SERVICES AVAILABLE LAW TAKE IT TO HEART YOU KNOW YOUR COMMENT ON ON A DIFFERENT AGE APPROPRIATE -- SERVICES FOR FOR YOUTH AND WILL MAKE SURE THAT THAT THAT'S ADDRESSED AS WELL -- AND WELL -- I'D I'D I DON'T THINK IT CAN BE SAID THAT SUBSTANCE ABUSE -- GONNA ISN'T SIGNIFICANT ISSUE AND I ALSO WOULD WOULD POINT OUT -- THAT -- USED TO AGE TWENTY FIVE THAT IS THE PERIOD OF TIME -- WHEN YOUNG PEOPLE FREQUENTLY HAVE THEIR FIRST PSYCHOLOGICAL BREAKING -- AND END UP IN CRISIS SO -- THOSE KIND OF SERVICES ARE -- NOT -- MINOR THINGS IN MY OPINION THERE CRITICAL ABSOLUTELY I TOTALLY AGREE AND I DON'T KNOW IF. THEY'RE OR ANTHONY IF EITHER YOU YOU WANTED YEAH I'D LIKE TO ADDRESS THAT -- SO ONE OF THE THINGS I WOULD LIKE TO SAY JUST IN GENERAL -- TO MISTER WHEN MR BLOOM BUT WHEN WE RAISE SOME OF THE ISSUES AS FAR AS THE SAFETY YOU KNOW THE DRUG ABUSE ISSUES THAT THAT COULD BE PRESENT IN THE COMMUNITY. I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT WERE FOR THIS IS A STUDENT CENTRIC -- BILL WE LOOK AT THE STUDENT POPULATION THEY'VE MADE THAT INITIAL STEP TO TRY TO GET THEMSELVES IN HIGHER EDUCATION TO TRY TO GET THEMSELVES IN. OUT OF THE SITUATION AND TO BETTER THEIR LIVES. FROM THE MOST PART AND YOU KNOW I'VE INTERACTED WITH. IT COUNTLESS STUDENTS WHO HAVE BEEN IN THESE SITUATIONS. AND I WOULD SAY THAT DRUG ABUSE. I DON'T KNOW THAT IT IS AN ISSUE AND I WOULD SAY YOU KNOW WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE COLLEGE STUDENT COMMUNITY YEAH I MEAN WHEN YOU LOOK AT THOSE PEOPLE THAT ARE MOST VULNERABLE. MORE OFTEN THAN NOT IT IS THE COST OF LIVING IT IS BEING ON THEIR OWN FOR THE FIRST TIME IT'S TRANSFERRING TO A SCHOOL OUT OF STATE. THAT LEADS THEM TO THE SITUATION WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT THE GENERAL HOMELESS POPULATION DRUG ABUSE ALCOHOL ABUSE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES THOSE MIGHT BE THE MORE PREVALENT ISSUES WE TALK ABOUT THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE STUDENT CENTRIC. MOST OF THE STUDENTS THEY MIGHT BE SUFFERING WITH MENTAL INSTABILITY SOME CERTAIN ISSUES BUT IT'S GONNA BE TO A FAR LESS EXTENT. AND WE CAN SAY THAT BECAUSE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE STUDENTS THEY'RE GOING TO CLASSES IT'S INDICATIVE I'M NOT GONNA SIGN UP FOR CLASSES IF I'M YOU KNOW HAVING ALL THESE MENTAL ISSUES I'M PROBABLY NOT GONNA BE AS APT. TO ROLL INTO COLLEGE I'M HAVING A COULD BE AS APT TO YOU KNOW BE IN THAT SITUATION WHERE I'M TRYING TO BETTER MYSELF SO WE LOOK AT THOSE SITUATIONS I WOULD SAY. MOST OF THEM ARE JUST POOR CHOICES OR BEING OUT YOUNG AND ON THEIR OWN FOR THE FIRST TIME -- BUT THE STATE'S NOT SAYING YOU KNOW AS YOU SAID MR BLOOM IT'S NOT SAYING THAT IT'S OKAY TO BE HOMELESS I MEAN IT'S NOT NORMALIZING I WOULD SAY IT'S DE STIGMATIZING AND IF I WOULD HAVE KNOWN. THAT I COULD HAVE PARKED IN MY COLLEGE CAMPUS OVERNIGHT. I MEAN I I NEVER ONCE USED DRUGS -- YOU KNOW THE ENTIRE TIME I WAS LIVING IN MY CAR I NEVER MET -- ONE NEVER MET SOMEBODY. WHO IS IN A SIMILAR SITUATION WE ENDED UP IN A SITUATION BECAUSE OF DRUGS OR ALCOHOL OF TIMES? THE PEOPLE USE THEM ONCE YOU'RE IN THAT SITUATION TO NUMB THE PAIN. IT'S A PAINFUL SITUATION BEING HOMELESS BE AFRAID AT NIGHT KNOW THEM TO BE HARASSED I CAN UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW WANTED TO BE ABLE TO JUST GET A FEW HOURS OF SLEEP SO I YOU KNOW I MAYBE A DRINK WHAT ABOUT RIGHT TAKES MEDICINE. TRY TO GET YOU KNOW GET OUT OF THAT THAT FEELING OF DESPERATION THAT I HAVE BUT I WOULD SAY THAT'S NOT THE LEADING CAUSE OF THAT'S PROBABLY THAT'S MORE OFTEN THAT THE FACTOR THAT CONTRIBUTES TO BILLS PEOPLE USING THOSE. WERE ABUSING THE SUBSTANCES SO I WOULD SAY THAT THE STATE'S NOT REALLY SAYING THAT IT'S OKAY YOUR FOR YOU. YOU KNOW THIS IF THE ISSUE IS GOING TO GO AWAY. WHETHER WE PASS THIS BILL OR NOT COSTUMES ARE GONNA BE HOMELESS WE PASSED THE BILL QUESTIONS WILL CONTINUE TO BE HOMELESS WHAT THIS DOES IS IT PUTS SUPPORT IN PLACE FOR THE STUDENTS. TO WHO ARE STRUGGLING WHO DON'T KNOW WHERE TO TURN TO BE ABLE TO SAY HEY WE HAVE AN ACCESS FOR YOU TO GET YOU OUT OF THE SITUATION IT'S DEFINITELY DON'T WANT TO BE A PERMANENT SITUATION SOME PEOPLE ABUSE THAT THOSE LIVING APART RENT FREE IT'S CALIFORNIA IT'S EXPENSIVE. I DEFINITELY UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE STUDENTS FOR THE MOST PART THEY JUST WANT TO GET OUT OF THAT SITUATION. IF WE DON'T PUT A PROGRAM IN PLACE AND WHAT ARE WE OFFERING STUDENTS. YEAH IF I COULD HAVE A QUICK RESPONSE -- TO YOU KNOW I THINK THAT WORKING ON SIMULTANEOUSLY ON LONGER TERM HOUSING STRATEGIES WHILE EMPLOYING A HARM REDUCTION STRATEGY -- IS NOT A MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE GOAL I THINK WE CAN DO BOTH AT THE SAME TIME SO IT'S NOT SORT OF EITHER OR I DON'T THINK IT UNDERCUTS EFFORTS TO PROVIDE LONGER TERM HOUSING STRATEGIES. AND AT THIS BILL DOESN'T ALLOW STUDENTS TO SLEEP IN THEIR CARSTENS ARE ALREADY SLEEPING IN THEIR CARS IT ALLOWS AN OF A SAFE PLACE TO PARK AND I KNOW THAT JUST YOUR CONVERSATIONS WITH BOTH OF THE STUDENTS HERE. THEY TALKED ABOUT KIND OF NEGATIVE RAMIFICATIONS FROM THE COMMUNITY WHEN THEY DIDN'T HAVE A SAFE PLACE TO PARK AND FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND SO THAT MADE IT YOU KNOW ODD A DIFFICULT SITUATION EVEN HARDER IT SORT OF ADDING INSULT TO INJURY WHEN NOT ONLY ARE THEY IN A SITUATION THEY HAVE TO BE SLEEPING THEIR CARBON THEY'RE ALSO EXPERIENCING. YOU KNOW THE KIND OF STIGMA AND TO BE IS -- FROM THE COMMUNITY ABOUT HAVING TO DO THAT SO I THINK WHILE WE WORK ON LONG TERM STRATEGIES. RECOGNIZING THAT THIS IS A CRISIS I MEAN THAT WE SHOULD HAVE THAT BIAS TOWARD ACTION IN RESPONDING I'M WITH REALLY THE LOWEST PAYING FOR THAT WE CAN POSSIBLY THINK OF AS IMMEDIATELY AS POSSIBLE. MR GAVE UP. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I JUST WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE FOR REPORT THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE I REALLY APPLAUD YOU THIS IS A SUCH A CHALLENGE FACING OUR STATE -- AND I WANTED TO SAY THANK YOU ALSO APPLAUD THE THE WITNESSES AS WELL FOR YOUR VERY POWERFUL TESTIMONY. I KNOW THAT IT'S ARE YOU CAN IMAGINE IT'S NOT AN EASY THING TO COME UP HERE AND TO TO SHARE YOUR STORY IN SUCH A PUBLIC WAY BUT I THINK IT'S REALLY POWERFUL AND IT REALLY PUTS A FACE ON WHAT I THINK IS A HUGE MORAL CRISIS THAT WE'RE FACING. IS THE STATE'S LARGEST ONE APPLIED BOTH OF YOU FOR HAVING THE COURAGE TO COME HERE AND TO SHARE YOUR STORIES AND SO GLAD TO HEAR THAT YOU'RE BACK WITH YOUR FAMILY AND AND JUST APPRECIATE. YOUR WILLINGNESS TO TO TO BE PART OF THIS CONVERSATION -- I DO UNDERSTAND MY MY COLLEAGUES THEIR CONCERNS THIS IS THIS IS AN AS YOU'VE KNOWLEDGE BUT NOT A LONG TERM SOLUTION. RIGHT THIS IS UNCOMFORTABLE AND IN PERFECT RESPONSE TO WHAT IS A VERY VERY CHALLENGING. PLEASED TO SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY I THINK THAT FOLKS HAVE MADE SOME SUGGESTIONS ABOUT WAYS THAT MIGHT BE IMPROVED I APPRECIATE -- THE AUTHORS WILLINGNESS TO CONSIDER THOSE I WOULD SPECIFICALLY HIGHLIGHT -- ANYTHING WE CAN DO TO DO SOME TYPE OF REPORT EVALUATION ANALYSIS I THINK THAT SUPPORT WITH ANY. ANYTHING THAT WE DO IN PUBLIC POLICY -- ESPECIALLY SOMETHING LIKE THIS WHERE WE ARE -- MAYBE -- BREAKING A LITTLE BIT OF NEW GROUND I THINK EVALUATION ANALYSIS NUMBER TWO FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO HEAR IS THIS WORKING IS THIS NOT WORKING ARE THE WAYS THAT WE CAN IMPROVE UPON IT -- WOULD BE WOULD BE AN IMPORTANT THING SO AGAIN JUST ONE APPLY THE AUTHOR WANT TO APPLAUD THE WITNESSES FOR YOUR VERY POWERFUL TESTIMONY AND I'LL BE PLEASED TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY. THANK YOU MISTER CHOI. I THANK THE CHAIR AND THE NORTH SO I WANNA AT MY A US A QUOTE -- TO A. B.. THREE OH TWO AND ASSEMBLYMEMBER OF BERMAN SAID -- A CONCERN ON THIS -- HOME NESS OF STUDENTS. AND THAT THIS IS THE REALITY. IN THE LISTENING TO WITNESSES -- I MEAN THIS IS SO. NOT A FIX AS A TEMPORARY ADDING A LITTLE MORE CALM FOR THE WAY TO PARK IN HUNDRED WHEN FORCED MONTH DENTAL SO. LOCAL ORDINANCES SO WOULD NOT ALLOW. YOU TO PARK IN THE CITY BUT I AND THEN ALSO. A SOME AREAS -- DANGERS SO THIS IS A TEMPORARY -- SOLUTION BUT WHEN WE PROVIDE THAT THAT KIND OF A ADDRESS THAT THE ARE YOU GOING TO AT THAT REQUIRED THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES SO. BUT THAT THE STATE CAN PROVIDE THE FULL. BECAUSE OF THIS ONE SYSTEM TO REQUIRE HOLD CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES. SO THAT MEANS US OF THE MANDATING. SO -- IS IT GONNA BE UNFUNDED MANDATE THOUGH WHAT I CAN OUR SUGGEST A CERTAIN DAUGHTERS SO TO THAT THOUGH BECAUSE SO. I'M PICTURING MYSELF FOR IT FOLLOWS. PROVIDED THAT IS SECURE PLACE OUR APPRECIATE THE ONCE I SUBMIT THEIR AND YOU KIND OF WHAT THE REST ROOM AND THEN THE SHOWER. AND AN ON CAMPUS OR THE CAFETERIA VIDEO OR CLOSED I DON'T KNOW. SO HOW WE WANT TO ADDRESS THAT THAT ADDITIONAL CONVENIENCE AT THAT A OF THE NEEDED YEAH THANK YOU DOCTOR CHOI AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT NEEDS THE IMPORTANT QUESTION AND IF. IF IT'S REQUIRED IN THE BILL THEN IT IS A STATE MANDATE AND AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE. CAN DISTRICTS WILL GET REIMBURSED -- FOR THE EXPENSES AS A PROCESS I GIVE YOU THE WHOLE PAGE LONG ANSWER BUT ALL DAHLE D. JUST KIND OF SKIP IT AND SAY. IT'S IF IT'S A STATE MANDATE THEY GET REIMBURSED THERE'S A PROCESS TO GO THROUGH TO GET REIMBURSED -- AND AND YOU KNOW THAT THAT IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE BILL IT HASN'T WE HAVEN'T -- RECEIVED -- FINANCIAL ANALYSIS YET THAT I HAVE BEEN IN THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE AND SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT DOLLAR AMOUNT IS YET IT ALL HAPPENED THE PROVISIONS COMMITTEE IF WE MAKE IT THAT FAR -- BUT BUT IF IT'S REQUIRED IN THE BILL THEN IT'S A STATE MANDATE THAT THAT WOULD BE REIMBURSED. LIKE AT SOMETHING THAT IF I CAN -- WHEN WE LOOK AT SOME OF THE COSTS OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND -- TO BE PUT IN PLACE TO SUPPORT THIS. SO I ACTUALLY -- WE'VE HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH THE DIRECTOR OF DREAMS FOR CHANGE WHICH IS -- OVERNIGHT PARKING PROGRAM IN THE SAN DIEGO AREA THEY RUN OVER TO OVERNIGHT PARKING PROGRAM SUCCESSFULLY PROBABLY FIVE TO SEVEN YEARS NOW -- I WILL NOT WITHOUT A SINGLE INCIDENT THAT CONCERNS US SAFETY RELIABILITY FOR THE PEOPLE INVOLVED. I'M FOR THE ENTIRE TIME THAT'S DR THERESA SMITH WHO IS THE DIRECTOR OF THAT PROGRAM SO WE'VE HAD HER COME OUT -- AND PRESENTED ARE -- STERN GOVERNMENT -- MEETINGS -- AND SO THE DATA THAT WE'VE GOTTEN FOR HER AND AGAIN YOU KNOW SHE'S BEEN RUN INTO THESE PROGRAMS FOR SEVERAL YEARS. IS THAT THE COSTS FOR INFRASTRUCTURE NOW -- AS MISTER -- SOME NOT I'M GONNA STOP A LITTLE BIT THE DISCUSSION ON THAT BECAUSE I WILL REMIND THE COMMITTEE THAT THAT WE ARE THE POLICY COMMITTEE AND NOT THE AND NOT THE BUDGET COMMITTEE OR THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE SO IF I MAY JUST FOR EXPEDIENCY. OF LET'S MOVE FORWARD THAT'S ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU OKAY AT BECAUSE MR GABRIEL. THAT IS QUESTION DOCTOR WEBER AND THEN MISTER SUN -- I DO WANT TO THANK YOU FOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD YOU KNOW I DON'T. I DON'T THINK ANY OF US WOULD HAVE THOUGHT. SIX YEARS AGO NOW WHEN WE STARTED THE CAMPUS CLIMATE COMMITTEE THAT WE WOULD BE IN A POSITION OF DEALING WITH THESE KINDS OF ISSUES AS WELL AS THE OTHER ISSUES. BASED ON CAMPUSES -- BUT AS CHAIR THAT COMMITTEE BECAME VERY CLEAR THAT WE HAD NOT ONLY ISSUES OF RACE AND GENDER BUT ISSUES OF ECONOMIC ON OUR CAMPUSES. THAT HAD A THE ABILITY TO REALLY CHANGE THE CULTURE OF CAMPUSES AND MAKE THEM VERY DIFFERENT PLACES AND WE HAD ENVISIONED. BOB I'M VERY PROUD OF THE FACT THAT SO MANY OF OUR CAMPUSES OF TAKEN THE CHALLENGE OF TRYING TO MEET THE NEEDS OF STUDENTS IN TERMS OF ECONOMICS -- FOOD IN SECURITY HOUSING AND SECURITY YOU KNOW -- TAKING THE STIGMA OUT OF THE SO CALLED COUCH SURFING CULTURE AND WHICH WAS A JOKE THAT IS A REALITY FOR SO MANY STUDENTS AS THEIR THIS IS NOT A PERFECT SOLUTION BUT WE CAN IGNORE THE PROBLEM AND IF SO WE WILL HAVE EVEN MORE PROBLEMS THAN BEFORE -- WE SAW THAT IN SAN DIEGO WHEN WE TRIED TO IGNORE THE HOMELESS POPULATION AND ENDED UP WITH THIS HELP. EIGHT UP WE DIDN'T WANT TO PROVIDE RESTROOMS IN WANT TO PROVIDE WATER WE DIDN'T WANT TO PROVIDE CERTAIN THINGS INDIVIDUAL THINKING THAT THAT WOULD HELP THAT WOULD JUST GO AWAY THAT IF WE HAD. RESTROOMS AND WATER IN THOSE KINDS OF THINGS THAT SOMEONE OF THAT WOULD ENCOURAGE HOMELESSNESS AND KNOW WHAT IT DID WAS MAKE PEOPLE DO WHAT THEY HAD TO DO ALL OF THE CITY IN FACT EVERYBODY IN HAD PEOPLE DIED FROM HIP IT. AND SO WE REALIZED AT LEAST WE SHOULD HAVE THAT YOU CAN'T IGNORE THE PROBLEMS YOU HAVE PROGRESSIVELY FACE THEM THE BEST WAY YOU CAN AND THEN WORK TO MAKE SURE THOSE PROBLEMS DON'T COME BACK. WE HAVE A MAJOR PROBLEM OBVIOUSLY KNOCKED ME TO CALL JUST BECAUSE WE DON'T ADEQUATELY FUND STUDENTS TO GO TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE. YOU KNOW IT'S NOT AS THOUGH THE HOMELESS POPULATIONS WHICH GREATER THERE THAN IT IS AT SEA ISSUE AND YOU SEE BECAUSE THEY GET LARGER GRANTS TO PAY FOR HOUSING -- WE GIVE OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS JUST THE MONEY FOR CLASSES AND BOOKS BUT WE DON'T WE DON'T FUND HOUSING -- AND AND BECAUSE I SOME XIN IS THAT THESE ARE. A LITTLE BIT HIGHER THAN A HIGH SCHOOL GROUP OF FOLKS AND THEY STILL LIVING AT HOME WITH MOM AND DAD AND THE WORLD HAS CHANGED IN TERMS OF COMMUNITY COLLEGES. AND AS A RESULT WE HAVE MORE AND MORE STUDENTS AND OUR COMMUNITY IS A HIGHER PERCENTAGE THEN IT THEN AT C. ISSUE AND YOU SEE WHO ARE PRUDENT SECURE IN WHO ARE HOMELESS -- AND AND IT GOES BACK TO OUR OWN VISION OF WHAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE DOING SO. I'M HOPING THAT IN THE PROCESS OF THIS. WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE IN AND AND IT'S POINTED OUT SAN DIEGO HAS THESE PLACES WHERE PEOPLE PART BECAUSE? WE DISCOVERED THAT THERE WERE PEOPLE WITH A MOBILE HOME PARK IN ALL OF OUR NEIGHBORHOODS. YEAH YOU COME OUT IS A BIT MORE HOMELESS BEEN SIGNIFICANT RE DAYS BECAUSE THEY FIND THE CUL DE SAC THAT'S EMPTY AND IF IT IS ACTUALLY PEOPLE WHO WAS SLEEPING THERE THERE THAT THEY'VE. THEIR CAMPING THERE SO SAN DIEGO HAD TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT AND WE CREATED THESE PLACES IN SOME CHURCHES HAVE PLACES WHERE PEOPLE PART. AND THEY PROVIDE SECURITY WE HAVEN'T HAD AN INCIDENT IN SO YOU CAN SOMETIMES SEE THAT AND IT'S A STOP GAP MEASURE WHERE YOU CAN AT LEAST PUT PEOPLE TOGETHER AND TRY TO WORK WITH THEM TO GET THE RESOURCES THEY NEED. TO GET THEM OUT OF THAT POSITION AND GET THEM BACK IN THE HOUSING VERY FEW PEOPLE WANT TO BE HOMELESS. AND YOU KNOW VERY FEW THERE ARE FEW WHO WHO WHO AS YOU PULL OUT BUT MOST FOLKS DON'T WANT THAT THEY WANT TO BE SECURE SO. I THANK YOU FOR THIS I KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO DRESS ALL THE ISSUES THAT OUR CAMPUSES HAVE -- MAKING SURE THAT THERE'S SOME OF SAFETY IN THOSE KINDS OF THINGS BUT IF WE DON'T PASS THIS BILL. THEY WILL STILL BE HOMELESS. AND THEY WILL STILL BE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO PARK THE CAR AND WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO AT LEAST AT SOME POINT THIS PUTS THEM IN ONE PLACE SO WE CAN BEGIN. TO TARGET THEM AND GET THE RESOURCES THEY NEED THERE BUT ALSO THE RESOURCES ON CAMPUS SO I THANK YOU -- FOR BRINGING THE BILL FOR THANK YOU THANK YOU TO WHOEVER [inaudible] SANTIAGO. YOU KNOW I KIND OF THINK -- MISS WEBBER WAS LOOKING AT MY NOTES. THOSE ARE THE EXACT SAME TWO THINGS UP AND LEAVE. BECAUSE I I HAVE THEM IN THE AUTHOR I'VE TALKED IN THE PAST RIGHT IF I WEAR MY PREVIOUS COMMITTEE COLLEGE FOR PRESIDENT -- WAS THE PRESIDENT THE LARGEST COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT IN CALIFORNIA -- LA CCD AND IF I WERE MY POLICY ONE CAT AND THEN THIS DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. AND SIMPLY DOESN'T MAKE SENSE IN A DOZEN PENCIL OUT. BUT THEN IN THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE I CURRENTLY WITH MY HEART -- IN IN IN AND I WILL ECHO SINCE YOU'RE READING UP MY NOSE ANYWAYS YEAH REPEAT NORTH. BUT LET ME THAT. I HAVE A CHALLENGE WITH THE BUT IT'S IT'S MY HEART BUT I'M A LET LEAD ON THIS PARTICULAR THIS PARTICULAR VOTE BECAUSE NO ONE WANTS. TO BE HOMELESS. NO WAKES UP IN THE MORNING SAYS I WANT TO BE HOMELESS. I AT LEAST I HAVE MET SOMEBODY WHO SAYS THAT YET. AND MOST WE KNOW THAT HOW HOW PASSIONATE ABOUT BUT I AM ABOUT THAT ISSUE -- I REPRESENT THE AREA SKID ROW WHERE THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE LIVES ON THAT BUT I ALSO UNDERSTAND WHEN BAD POLICY DECISIONS. ARE AND WHERE AND WHEN -- URBAN PLANNING IS A WELL THOUGHT OUT IT CREATES THOSE KIND OF SITUATIONS. SOME CONSCIOUS OF THAT IN AND WHEN I TAKE A LOOK AT THIS. WHICH IS WHY I STARTED SAYING IT WITH I'M WEARING MY POLICY ONE CANNOT MORE INTO MY COMMITTEE COLLEGE BOARD ATTIC CETERA. I TAKE A LOOK AT THIS DECISION AND I GET TO GO PRETTY BAD. ABSOLUTELY PRETTY BAD ON AND THAT'S WHY I THERE'S A CAUTIOUS SIDE INSIDE AND YOU LOOK LIKE AYE AYE TRUSTING YOUR COMMITMENTS TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE ISSUES BECAUSE OUR SERVICE -- AND I TRUST THAT YOU BEEN RESPONSIBLE OF KEPT YOUR WORD AND AND AND ARE REALLY STRUGGLING TO TO ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE ISSUES -- AND THERE ARE SEVERAL RIGHT THERE'S A LIABILITY ISSUE THERE'S OF INSURANCE ISSUE -- HOW DO YOU DETERMINE -- WHO'S A STUDENT AND WHO'S NOT -- IN OUR AREA NOT THAT THEY MAY BE COOKIE CUTTER SOLUTIONS TO THEM THAT THAT THAT FOLKS A MENTION TO ME. AT THE END OF THE DAY IT DO YOU FOR SOMEBODY TO SHOW -- IDENTIFICATION OR NOT IF THERE'S OTHER PEOPLE IN THE CAR WOULD YOU DO -- THAT THERE'S A NUMBER OF THINGS MY HEART WILL LEAD TO SAY THAT WE'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING -- AND AND STUDENTS HAVE TO BE SAFE SOMEWHERE NOT NECESSARILY HAPPY WITH THAT BECAUSE OF THERE'S IT'S PROBLEMATIC -- YOU WHERE THE SHOWER -- YOU DID YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT PRESSING COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO ADDRESS AND REDEFINE THEMSELVES TO WHAT THEY SHOULD BE TODAY WHAT WHICH IS HELPING WITH WORKFORCE HOUSING WITH IS HELPING. A WITH ROB BROWN SUPPORT SERVICES WITH STUDENTS -- THE SIMPLE THINGS LIKE HAVING A STUDENT FILL OUT A FASSEL FORM -- COUNSELORS WRAPAROUND SUPPORT SERVICES GETTING EVERYONE ON THEIR FEET BUT SOMETHING LIKE THIS CAN GO PRETTY BAD IF IT'S NOT DONE. CORRECTLY. AND WHAT DO YOU DO LIKE IN OUR CARE WE STE WE CONTRACTED WITH THE SHARES -- FOR UP FOR PUBLIC SAFETY REASONS -- EIGHT WOULD YOU DO IF A STINT AS WANT TO SHOW IDENTIFICATION TO SHARE IT WOULD YOU DO IF THE SHERIFF -- WALKS AROUND IN HIS -- LOOKING IN IN THE CARS I MEAN WHAT KIND OF SAFE GUARDS TO PUT INTO PLACE -- AND THERE'S A LOT OF ANSWERED UNANSWERED QUESTIONS WHICH I BELIEVE THESE BECOME -- BECOMES A PROBLEMATIC TO IMPLEMENT AS IT IS. BUT I LEAD WITH MY HEART UNDERSTANDING IN KNOWING THAT YOU'RE GONNA DO THE VERY BEST POSSIBLE JOB. I DO THIS BUT WE'LL RESERVE MY RIGHT NONE THE LESS HI ON THE FLORIDA VOTE HOT ONE BUT YOU KNOW BUT THAT TAKES IT'S A HUGE CHALLENGE. I WOULDN'T WANT YOU TO YOU TO FOR ME -- TO BECOME COMPLACENT AND AND THINK THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE SOLVED THE PROBLEM I THINK WE'VE GOT A PUSH TO BE TO FIND WHAT COMMUNITY COLLEGES DO HOW SERVICES. ARE HANDLED WHAT COUNSELOR SHOULD DO -- WHETHER THEY BE TRY AND WHETHER WE HELP IN ROLE PEOPLE AND CAL WORKS -- MEDI CAL -- ECCENTRICS FEDERAL EITC PROGRAMS OF ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO DO WE HAVE TO PUSH SIMILAR BUT EVEN STUDENT HOUSING ALTHOUGH I UNDERSTAND THE CHALLENGES WITH. WITH TO YOUR PART TIME STUDENT SUCCESS -- BUT I THINK LOOK AT I THINK IT'S WORTH THE CONVERSATION HAVE BECAUSE WE'VE GOT TO ADDRESS -- THE HOMELESS ISSUE IN CALIFORNIA WE'VE GOT TO ALSO ADDRESS. CHILDREN IN AND SMALL -- SINGLE MOTHERS LIVING ON THE STREETS AND AND STUDENTS LIVING IN THEIR CARS. HI AM AND FOR THE REASONS HOLD ON MY HEART TO LEAD ON THIS. ONE THEY USE ON THE BIRTH. MR LIVING -- GET GREAT GREAT BILL GREAT STARTING POINT WE'RE SOLVING AN IMMEDIATE NEED WE DO THE SAME THING WITH THE SHOWERS A FEW YEARS AGO PEOPLE NEED TO HAVE A WAY TO BE SUCCESSFUL WITH THEIR DAY KNOWING WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO SLEEP IS ANOTHER IMPORTANT COMPONENT TO THAT -- DOESN'T GET THE JOB DONE AS WE KNOW AND WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT A WAY THAT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES AS THEIR IDENTIFYING WHO THOSE STUDENTS ARE ARE ALSO ABLE TO PUSH OUT -- MISS SANTIAGO MENTION WRAPAROUND SERVICES IS EVERYONE AVAILING THEMSELVES OF THE FINANCIAL AID THAT MAY CAN RECEIVE. HOW CAN WE HELP YOU TO SOMETHING BETTER THAN THIS HOMELESSNESS ARE PRECARIOUSLY HOUSE STATE AND YOUR FOR REGISTERING THOSE CARS HOWEVER STUDENTS DO THAT? THAT THAT IS ONE WAY TO CAPTURE THEM IN A POSITIVE WAY TO SAY ARE WE GIVING YOU ALL THE SUPPORT THAT YOU ALREADY QUALIFY. FOR THAT YOU JUST DIDN'T KNOW THAT YOU WERE ABLE TO GET.

I JUST WANT TO BRIEFLY TOUCH ON A FEW POINTS AND AND ALLOW MOST OF THE TIME -- FOR FOR THE WONDERFUL -- SPONSORS AND SUPPORTERS THAT THAT ARE HERE WITH ME RESEARCH HAS CONSISTENTLY SHOWN THE CORRELATION BETWEEN HIGH SCHOOL DROPOUT RATES AND POVERTY. ACCORDING TO STUDIES OF A NUMEROUS STUDIES ROUGHLY FIVE INTENT HIGH SCHOOL DROPOUTS. WERE LIVING IN POVERTY 48% COMPARED TO LESS THAN ONE IN TEN COLLEGE GRADUATES ONLY AT EIGHT POINT 6%. SECOND THERE IS GROWING RECOGNITION THAT THE COST OF HIGHER EDUCATION AND BURDEN OF STUDENT THAT OR SERIOUS BARRIERS TO ECONOMIC MOBILITY. THIS IS WHERE CHILDREN SAVINGS ACCOUNT FALLS INTO PLAYING A MAJOR ROLE AB FIFTEEN WOULD CREATE A STATEWIDE CHILDREN SAVINGS PROGRAM -- TO BY TESTING THE SCHOLARS SURE INVESTMENT BOARD TO OPERATE A MASTER FIVE TWENTY NINE ACCOUNT OWNED BY THE STATE. THE CHILD WILL AUTOMATICALLY BE ENROLLED IN THE MASTER ACCOUNT AT BIRTH AND RECEIVE AN INITIAL C. DEPOSIT -- AND THE PROGRAM WILL ALLOW PRIVATE PHILANTHROPY TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE FUND AND ENCOURAGE ADDITIONAL INCENTIVES FOR LOW INCOME FAMILIES -- THREE POINTS THAT I'D LIKE TO MAKE IS AB FIFTEEN WILL ULTIMATELY JUMP START COLLEGE SAVINGS FOR ROUGHLY. OF FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND CHILDREN. BORN EACH YEAR IN CALIFORNIA TO CREATE A GIVE CHILDREN A REAL WORLD TOOL TO PRACTICE FINANCIAL LEADERS LITERACY. AND THREE ENABLE STUDENTS TO RAISE THEIR OWN EDUCATIONAL EXPECTATIONS WITH ME I'M VERY PROUD TO HAVE NOW YOU KNOW HOW BAD YOUNG FROM GLENDALE UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. AS WELL AS SABRINA HIM FROM THE CALIFORNIA ASSET BUILDING COALITION -- AS WELL AS WELL AS BEING JOINED BY THE STAFF FROM THE US. STATE TREASURER'S OFFICE. AND WE'LL KEEP YOU TO FOUR MINUTES YOU DON'T HAVE TO USE ALL THE TIME. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH CHAIRPERSON MEDINA AND COMMITTEE -- ON HIGHER EDUCATION FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY MY NAME IS SABRINA HAM I'M THE MANAGING DIRECTOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA ASSET BUILDING COALITION -- CBC REPRESENTS OVER TO THE TWO HUNDRED ORGANIZATIONS ACROSS CALIFORNIA AND WE WORK TO SUPPORT POLICIES AND PROGRAMS TO HELP LOW TO MODERATE INCOME FAMILIES BECOME MORE FIND FINANCIALLY SECURE. AND A CHEAP ECONOMIC MOBILITY WE ARE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB FIFTEEN WHICH WOULD CREATE A UNIVERSAL CHILDREN SAVINGS% ACCOUNT FOR EVERY CHILD AT BIRTH. IN CALIFORNIA UNDER THE STATE'S BY TWENTY NINE SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM RESEARCH SHOWS THAT A CHILD WITH ANY AMOUNT OF MONEY FOR STATE FOR COLLEGE IS THREE TIMES MORE LIKELY TO ATTEND COLLEGE AND FOUR TIMES MORE LIKELY TO GRADUATE. CHILDREN SAVINGS ACCOUNT CONTINUE TO DEMONSTRATE OVERWHELMING. THE POSITIVE IMPACT ON CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES WE ARE THRILLED TO HAVE SO MANY LOCAL BASED PROGRAMS ACROSS THE STATE. HOWEVER THEY ARE NOT AVAILABLE TO ALL CHILDREN. WE ARE IN NEED OF A UNIVERSAL PROGRAM TO REACH THE CHILDREN WHO DO NOT RESIDE IN THE AREAS WERE LOCAL SAID SAVINGS. ACCOUNTS ARE OFFERED WE FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT ALL STUDENTS SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO A SAVINGS ACCOUNT PROGRAM. AND THE UNIVERSAL PROGRAM THAT AB FIFTEEN PUTS FORTH WOULD ENSURE THAT ALL CHILDREN START WITH THE SMALL AMOUNT OF SEED MONEY IN A FIVE TWENTY NINE ACCOUNT. MORE FAMILIES WILL HAVE COLLEGE GOING CULTURE AND EXPECTATION FOR THEIR CHILD. AN INCREASE CULTURE FOR AFFORDABILITY FOR LOW INCOME FAMILIES. IF WE DO NOT ACT NOW CALIFORNIANS WILL FALL BEHIND IN OUR BASEMENT IN CHILDREN. THERE ARE STATEWIDE PROGRAMS IN ABOUT FIVE OTHER STATES SEVERAL OTHER STATE LEGISLATORS ARE CONTAINED ARE CONSIDERING SIMILAR LEGISLATION IN AB FIFTEEN THIS YEAR INCLUDING ILLINOIS MASSACHUSETTS NEW YORK AND WASHINGTON. THE TIME IS NOW FOR CAP FOR THE STATE TO INVEST IN EVERY CHILD IN CALIFORNIA AND THE FUTURE OF OUR STATE. I'M I THINK ASSEMBLY MEMBER NEWSSTAND FOR HIS CONTINUED COMMITMENT AND LEADERSHIP ON THIS AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK COMMITTEE FOR YOUR AYE ABOUT THANK YOU -- HELLO I'M NINE ARENA HOW BAD YOUNG AND I'M A BOARD OF EDUCATION MEMBER AND ON THE UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT AND ALSO A FACULTY MEMBER AT CAL STATE LA IN THE SCHOOL OF SOCIAL WORK. CHILDREN SAVINGS ACCOUNT CSA'S ARE A POWERFUL TOOL TO CHANGE THE TRAJECTORY OF KIDS LIVES UNIVERSAL CSA'S GIVE FINANCIAL ASSETS TO ALL KIDS BUT IT'S THE KIDS WITH THE GREATEST NEEDS WHO SHOW THE GREATEST GAINS. BENEFITS OF SAVINGS ACCOUNTS ARE REALLY WELL RESEARCH AND DEMONSTRATED AT THIS POINT THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT IT CSA'S FROM BIRTH HAVE SHOWN TO IMPROVE CHILDREN'S. NOT ONLY WHAT WAS MENTIONED BEFORE BUT ALSO THEIR SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT. WHICH IS DIRECTLY LINKED TO LATER ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT CSA'S A CREATE A COLLEGE GOING MIND SET WHICH IS CRUCIAL FOR COLLEGE ATTENDANCE. AS AN EXAMPLE JUST LAST YEAR. IT GLENDALE UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT WE ENROLLED AT ROOSEVELT MIDDLE SCHOOL STUDENTS AND A PILOT FIVE TWENTY NINE ACCOUNT. AND WE QUICKLY NOTICED JUSTIN THE MERE. ONE HUNDRED CASES THAT WE ENROLLED -- THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE STUDENTS WHO HAD THE SEAT DOLLARS AND THE STUDENTS WHO DID NOT HAVE THE THREE DOLLARS THOSE WITH THE ACCOUNTS WERE MORE INQUISITIVE. ENTHUSIASTIC AND SERIOUSLY ENGAGED WHEN THREE MONTHS LATER WE DID AN ACTIVE WE DID ACTIVITIES AROUND CAREER AND COLLEGE PATHWAYS PLANNING. CSA'S REYES PARENTS EXPECTATIONS OF THEIR CHILDREN. AND A BOOSTED THEIR OWN MENTAL HEALTH PARENTS MENTAL HEALTH WHICH IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THAT'S LINKED TO PARENTS ENGAGING WITH THEIR STUDENTS WITH THEIR CHILDREN. AND THUS BEING ENGAGE WITH THEIR EDUCATION. SO THAT'S OUR REDEVELOPMENT TREE WE HAD PARENTS TELL US THAT THEY WOULD HAVE NEVER CONSIDERED JUST THINKING ABOUT COLLEGE AND SAVINGS HAD WE HAD NOT OPENED THESE ACCOUNTS FOR THEM LAST YEAR. AND FINALLY CSA'S INCREASE PARENTS THE LIKELIHOOD OF SAVING THEIR OWN MONEY FOR THEIR KIDS FUTURE. THE FACT IS THAT CHILDREN FORM IDEAS ABOUT THEIR FUTURE VERY VERY EARLY IN THEIR LIVES. A FORM IDEAS ABOUT THEIR CAPACITIES THERE POSSIBILITIES AND THEIR COLLEGE AND THEIR CAREER OPPORTUNITIES. POVERTY CONTINUES TO BE CORRELATED WITH MANY KINDS OF CHALLENGES STRESSORS ABUSE NEGLECT AND LACK OF OPPORTUNITY AND IT IS NOT AN OVERSTATEMENT TO SAY THAT GETTING ONE YOUTH. TO COLLEGE OR ON THE CORRECT CAREER PATH GOES A LONG WAY TOWARD LIFTING THAT WHOLE FAMILY. OUT OF POVERTY IN ONE GENERATION WITH THE STATE WIDE INTERVENTION THOUGH A STATE WIDE WHICH IS WHAT IS NEEDED LIKE AB EIGHT ONE FIVE WE CAN TRULY MOVE TOWARD GETTING OUR MOST VULNERABLE KIDS. HEAD START AND REALLY ELEVATING CHILDREN AND FAMILIES INTO A BRIGHTER FUTURE AND A STATEWIDE MEASURE. THANK YOU THINK AND OTHER WITNESSES HAVE YOU IT PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME AND THE ORGANIZATION YOU REPRESENT GOOD AFTERNOON POSH ON THE UC SOON ASSOCIATION WE'RE IN SUPPORT.

ANGELA WILLIAMS CALIFORNIA'S LIKE ALFA WORK IN SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ANY TWEETERS ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. MISTER NAZARIAN IF YOU'D LIKE TO CLOSE. I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS THANK CHAIR. FIND THE THAT THIS IS SUPPORT SUPPORT. YEAH I I YEAH I DO SUPPORT DOT. I LIKE THAT -- BECAUSE I HAVE ALSO SIMILAR -- IT NOT NOT BY SIMILAR BUT THEY'RE RELATED THIS US GONNA SHARE -- FIVE TWENTY NINE I THINK THE BILL NUMBERS OF FOUR FOUR FOUR TO HAVE A TAX -- A DEDUCTION ABILITY -- FOR PARENTS TO IN IN IN THE INVESTOR AND YET AND YET THE PERSON BUT THIS ONE IS SOME MANDATED. THE ASIAN OFF -- SCHOLARS SHARE ON THE FIVE TWENTY NINE AND THE STATE THAT AT THE IS A LACK OF SOCIAL SECURITY AUTOMATICALLY -- YOU ARE MANDATING REQUIRING FOR OUT BUT I DO SEE THAT THE ABILITY TO OPT OUT. BUT THE THE SENATE ESSENTIALLY -- YOU ARE. EXPECTING EVERYBODY -- TO IS SET UP BOB -- FIVE TWENTY NINE PLAN AND THE TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS SO THE INITIAL -- INVESTMENT THE BY THE STATE. BUT MY QUESTION IS -- ANY ANY SCHOLARSHIP FUND IS SO GOOD THEN -- NOT HAVING ANYTHING THIS IS AN CORD TO MATT AS WE HEAR FROM THAT WITNESSES SO. BUT I WONDER HOW YOU ARE NOT TECHNICALLY. HANDLE. IF I HAVE MY OWN CHARS OF FIVE TWENTY NINE PLAN ALREADY -- AND DO I A HOW DO I USED ON ONE PLAN WHAT CAN I SET UP A FIVE TWENTY NINE MULTIPLE PLANS A DUST ONE WALL. MORE THAN ONE THE C. DEPOSIT THE IS NOT GONNA BE ALLOWED THE BUT THE THAT THAT SOUNDS LIKE A YOUR ALLOWING MORE THAN. ONE FIVE TWENTY NINE PLAN SO THAT'S THE AREA I'M NOT CLEAR ABOUT IF YOU CAN EXPECT A VERY BRIEFLY MISTER CHAIR IF I CAN. OF ALL AND I'LL KEEP IT BRIEF AND I'M HAPPY TO TALK ABOUT THIS AT LENGTH LATER IF YOU'D LIKE AS WELL UP. CONGRATULATIONS IF IF YOU DO HAVE A FIVE TWENTY NINE PLAN FOR YOUR CHILD YOU ARE THE LUCKY WINNER OF BEING PART OF 3% OF CALIFORNIANS THAT ACTUALLY HAVE A PLAN FOR THEIR CHILD. THIS IS THE PROBLEM THAT WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS -- THIS IS A VERY VALUABLE TOOL AND IT'S A TOOL THAT CAN HELP UTILIZED THE MARKET GROWTH. TO HELP ENHANCE YOUR CHILD'S OPPORTUNITY. TO BE BETTER EDUCATED FOR FOR FOR HAVE A CAREER BUILDING OPPORTUNITIES BUT UNFORTUNATELY MANY PEOPLE ARE NOT UTILIZING IT SAID THIS BILL. IS JUST TO KIND OF JUMP START THAT OPPORTUNITY MAKE THAT HAVE THE STATE MAKE THE INITIAL INVESTMENT. OF MAYBE THERE WOULD BE A LOCAL MATCHING PROGRAM BECAUSE MANY CITIES AND JURISDICTIONS IN CALIFORNIA ARE NOW LOOKING AT DOING THIS AS EVIDENCED BY WHAT OF A SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER NOT THAT YOUNG WAS TALKING ABOUT. OF MOTIVATE PARENTS TO BECOME MORE ENGAGED AND INVEST. AND THEN LAST BUT NOT LEAST ALLOW PHILANTHROPIC ORGANIZATIONS AND CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS TO LOOK AND MAKE THEIR OWN ASSESSMENT SINCE THIS IS A UNIVERSAL PROGRAM. MAKE THEIR ASSESSMENT OF WHICH CHILD GIVEN THE DEMOGRAPHICS AND NEEDS THEY'D WANT TO INVEST MORE IN -- SO I THINK ALL AROUND IT'S A BENEFIT AND IT ALLOWS FOR MORE INDIVIDUALS TO PARTICIPATE. IN THE IN A PROGRAM THAT UNFORTUNATELY TOO FEW HAVE BEEN TAKING ADVANTAGE OF OR BEING INVOLVED IN. SO WILL THIS BE ARE MOVING FOR THE PLANET -- IF IT PASSES -- THEN MOVING FORWARD DIED LAST SAY UP FOR NEXT YEAR ALONE ANY ANY TYPE. OF BEING BORN ARE FROM NEXT YEAR WOULD BE AUTOMATICALLY. A REGISTERED TO AND THAT THAT WILL GIVE. RUNS -- TO INVEST MORE AND THEN IS THE SEED MONEY TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS A WOULD GROW BUT TWENTY FIVE THOMAS ITSELF IS NOT GOING TO BE. SUFFICIENT AT ALL NO MATTER HOW MUCH IT ROLES -- IS SUFFERING WE MORE BUT IT IS SUCH AN ENCOURAGEMENT SO IT IS -- TO TO ENCOURAGE PARENTS SO SO THAT'S WHY I AM IN SUPPORT OF THAT BUT THE HOW WE GONNA -- EXISTING ONCE OF PARENTS ARE. RIGHT NOW DO WE HAVE THIS ONE SO. WITH THE P. -- SSS UP RIGHT THE ONLY MOVING FOR DONE. NEW BORN CHILDREN ARE. WILL BE MANDATE. YES IT WITH THE AUTHOR'S CONSENT -- I WOULD ASK IF IF THE YOU COULD. MAYBE -- CONNECT WITH THE VICE CHAIR AND COME TO HAVE A DISCUSSION. OUTSIDE OF COMMITTEE MEETING OKAY THANK WITH THE BRIEF ANSWERS YES. YES. OR SO AS WE HAVE A MOTION.

AB SIXTEEN FORTY FIVE IS A BILL THAT WILL DESIGNATE A DREAM RESOURCE LIAISON I CALIFORNIA PUBLIC COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. SINCE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF AB FIVE FORTY THE CALIFORNIA DREAM ACT AND OTHER MEANINGFUL PIECES OF LEGISLATION ACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY TO HIGHER EDUCATION IS NOW ATTAINABLE FOR ARE UNDOCUMENTED STUDENT POPULATION. IT IS ESTIMATED THAT EACH YEAR APPROXIMATELY SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS GRADUATE FROM HIGH SCHOOL AND WHILE CALIFORNIA HAS TAKEN THE LEAD TO ENACT LEGISLATION TO PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR UNDOCUMENTED YOUTH. WE ONLY SEE 20% OF THE STUDENTS ATTENDING COLLEGE. WE MUST AND CAN DO MORE TO HELP STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES NAVIGATE THE HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM. WHERE WE ARE IN DIRE AND TURBULENT TIMES AS THERE IS NO END IN SIGHT FOR THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATIONS CONSTANT THREAT TO DR? UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS CENTERS AND STAFF PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE AT OUR COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITY CAMPUSES AS IMMIGRATION POLICIES RAPIDLY SHIFT AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. ESTABLISHING A PERMANENT AND INSTITUTIONALIZED DREAM RESOURCE LIAISON I ON CALIFORNIA COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES WE WILL PROVIDE UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS WITH ADEQUATE EDUCATIONAL SUPPORT. GUIDANCE OF STATE FUNDED LIKE JUST LEGAL SERVICES AND ON A CAMPUS PROTECTION POLICIES. A DREAM RESOURCE LIAISON WOULD SATISFY THE CENTER -- COMPONENT TO WEAR DARK WHERE STUDENTS CAN EXPRESS EXPERIENCES AND GATHER ENSURE INVALUABLE INFORMATION THAT IS ESSENTIAL IN THE OUTCOMES OF STUDENT SUCCESS. ARE DREAMERS HAVE MADE CALIFORNIA BETTER WITH THEIR COUNTLESS AND RICH RELENTLESS ADVOCACY EFFORTS THE STUDENTS LIKE ME CAME TO THE U. KNIGHTED STATES FOR A BETTER OPPORTUNITY. AND IT IS OUR DUTY TO CREATE POLICIES THAT WILL LEAD THEM TO A SUCCESSFUL FUTURE AND A BETTER QUALITY OF LIFE. HERE WITH ME TODAY I HAVE -- COPIER GARCIA A YOUTH ORGANIZER TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY ON BEHALF OF THE COALITION FOR HUMANE IMMIGRATION IMMIGRANT RIGHTS. WE ALSO HAVE DIANNE NOT A STUDENT AT SACRAMENTO CITY COLLEGE THAT WOULD LIKE TO SHARE HER STORY WITH YOU. AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST -- CHRISTOPHER SANCHEZ POLICY ADVOCATE FOR CHIRLA. TO ADD TO ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS AND AND I JUST WANT TO REMIND THE WITNESSES WHAT I JUST FINISHED SAYING THAT IT'S FOUR MINUTES. ANYWAY YOU WANT. TO DIVIDE THE FOUR MINUTE. HI GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS GOT THE THAT SEE A AND I AM TO YOUTH ORGANIZER WITH WEISS UP THE HIGH SCHOOL COMPONENT -- CHEER Là BY WEISS A PROGRAM WE WORK WITH OVER ELEVEN HIGH SCHOOLS IN LA COUNTY WITH THE MAJORITY OF THE STUDENTS BEING UNDOCUMENTED. WE PROVIDE IS YOU'D WITH INFORMATION AND RESOURCES TO GO TO COLLEGE REGARDLESS OF THEIR LEGAL STATUS TODAY THE REALITY IS THAT EVERY DAY WE NEED MORE AND MORE YOU ACQUIRE BECOMING LESS THAN COURAGE TO GOAL OR STAY IN COLLEGE. BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THE GUIDANCE OR SUPPORT OF SOMEONE WHO IS TRAINED SPECIFICALLY ON UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS ISSUES. HAVING A DREAMILY A SON A COMMUNITY COLLEGES OR FOUR YEAR UNIVERSITIES WHO CAN PROVIDE UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS WITH THE RESOURCES THAT THEY NEED CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE -- WHETHER THEY STUDENTS DROP OUT A GRADUATE COLLEGE I KNOW THIS FIRST HAND BECAUSE I WAS ONCE IN UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS. MY FAMILY AND I MIGRATED TO THE US WHEN I WAS ELEVEN YEARS OLD WE ARRIVE IN LA WHERE I ATTEND THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN HIGH SCHOOL. IN MY SENIOR YEAR I HAD TO FACE THE HARSH REALITY WHEN MY COLLEGE COUNSELOR TOLD ME THAT THERE WASN'T ANY HELP FOR ME. FEELING HOPELESS I DECIDED TO ATTEND. A COMMUNITY COLLEGE IN COMMUNITY COLLEGE I HAD TO FIGURE EVERYTHING OUT BY MYSELF BECAUSE THE COUNSELORS DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO HOLD ME. DOING RESEARCH ON MY OWN AND NAVIGATING THE COLLEGE SYSTEMS ON MY OWN I WAS ABLE TO WE SEE MY BACHELORS DEGREE WITHIN FIVE YEARS. THERE WAS NO BACK UP IN THE POLITICAL CLASS I MAIN AND SUPPORT FOR UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS WAS MUCH DIFFERENT WHEN I WAS ATTENDING SCHOOL. TODAY MY STUDENTS FACE SIMILAR CHALLENGES AS A DATE THEY THEY DON'T HAVE DOCTOR AND THEY HAVE TO BUILD UP THE KOREJE EVERYDAY TO APPROACH A NEW STAFF. TO RELIEVE THEIR STATUS AS AB FIVE FORTY NOT KNOWING HOW THE PERSON IS GOING TO REACT. FOR THESE REASONS I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF AB SIXTEEN FORTY FIVE THANK YOU. HI GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYONE MY NAME IS DIANA MY OPPONENTS ARE SHE HER HER IS THE NAME OF THE DOCUMENTS STUDENTS ARE COMING CITY COLLEGE. OUR TO OUR GRADE SCHOOL I NURTURED THE IDEA THAT I WAS ONE DAY GOING TO GROW UP AND BECOME A PROFESSIONAL SOME SORT -- BUT THE PROBLEM LETTER THE FACT THAT I HAD ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA WHAT I WANTED TO BE AND MUCH LESS OF HOW I WAS GOING TO GET THERE. NOW THIS IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST RELATABLE DILEMMAS EVER BUT IT'S HONESTLY A LOT MORE DIFFICULT TO FIGURE OUT WHEN YOU'RE DOCUMENTED FROM LOW INCOME. YOU'RE THE FIRST THING YOU FROM IT'S A COMPLETE JERK A GRADE SCHOOL EDUCATION AND THE STATE AND THEN GO TO COLLEGE. I WAS LUCKY BECAUSE I HAD A TEAM THE BEST THING ABOUT COLLEGE HAS BEEN MEETING PEOPLE WHO STRUGGLED LIKE ME. BUT HAVE TAUGHT ME TO OVERCOME THE OBSTACLES. I WAS VERY LUCKY TO HAVE GUIDANCE ON CAMPUS BY PHIL JIMERSON ALLIES WHO ARE ALSO VERY MUCH SO PROFESSIONALS -- BEING ABLE TO GO TO SCHOOL KNOWING I HAVE A DECIMATED YOUR ADVOCATE ON CAMPUS HAS MADE ME FEEL WELCOME. THROUGH THEM I HAVE INVOLVED MYSELF ON AND OFF CAMPUS I HAVE BEEN PART OF SEVERAL ORGANIZATIONS THAT HELP ME DEVELOP POSITIVE GOAL SETTING MENTALITY AND TELL ME HOW TO CREATE A SAFE SPACE FOR OTHERS. BY CREATED ONE FOR ME. I'D LEARN TO TAKE CARE OF MY MENTAL HEALTH AND I NEVER THOUGHT HOW MUCH OF AN IMPACT THAT WOULD ACTUALLY MAKE. A THROUGH MY CAMPUS ADVOCATES I RECEIVE MANY RESOURCES THAT ARE EXCLUSIVELY FOR STUDENTS LIKE ME WHETHER IT'S SCHOLARSHIP OPPORTUNITY THAT GOVERNOR WORKSHOPS POLITICAL UPDATES OR SIMPLY SOMEONE TO RELATE. TO THIS IS WHY I AM HERE TODAY I URGE YOU TO TAKE ACTION IN SUPPORT AB SIXTEEN FORTY FIVE LET'S MAKE IT'S THAT OUR SCHOOLS PRO -- DO PROVIDE US WITH THE TOOLS TO REACH OUR GOALS BECAUSE EVERYONE TO SEARCH OUT SOMEONE IN THE CORNER WHO OFFICE IN THAT CITY SPACE. ACROSS THE NATION WE HAVE DREAMERS THAT SIMPLY WANT TO SUCCEED AND CONTRIBUTE TO MAKE THIS COUNTRY A BETTER PLACE I AM FORTUNATE TO BE FROM CALIFORNIA ONE OF THE MOST PROGRESSIVE ENDEAVOR STATES.

STATE TEACHER GRANT PROGRAM -- IN THE OBVIOUSLY SHOULD BE NO SURPRISE TO ANY MEMBER OF THIS COMMITTEE. OR IN THIS LEGISLATURE THAT THE SCHOOL DISTRICT ARE HAVING A VERY DIFFICULT TIME RECRUITING AND RETAINING. QUALIFIED CREDENTIALED TEACHERS. AND THE PROBLEM ONLY SEEMS TO BE GETTING WORSE -- IN OUR SCHOOLS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. A RECENT COMPREHENSIVE SURVEY OF TWO HUNDRED ELEVEN SCHOOL DISTRICTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE CALIFORNIA REVEALED THAT NEARLY THREE QUARTERS. OF THE SCHOOLS COULD NOT FIND OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS COULD NOT FIND ENOUGH QUALIFIED TEACHERS TO FILL THE CLASSROOMS. IN FACT THE SUPPLY OF NEW TEACHERS IS CURRENTLY HOVERING AT A TWELVE YEAR LOW. AB. TWELVE SIXTY THREE I'M SORRY. AB SIXTEEN TWENTY THREE CREATE A SERVICE SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM -- BY PROVIDING A ONE TIME GRANT OF TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS TO STUDENTS AND TEACHER PREPARATION PROGRAMS. IN EXCHANGE FOR THEIR COMMITMENT TO TEACH FOR FOUR YEARS IN A HIGH NEED SUBJECT AREA -- ACCORDING TO THIS BILL AND BASED ON THE DATA -- THE HIGH NEED SUBJECT AREAS INCLUDE SPECIAL EDUCATION LAST DAM WHICH IS SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY ENGINEERING AND MATH. AND BILINGUAL EDUCATION -- AND SO CLEARLY MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE TO END THAT CALIFORNIA'S TEACHER SHORTAGE. BUT YOU KNOW AB TWELVE OR SIXTEEN TWENTY THREE A WON'T ENTIRELY SOLVE OUR STATES. THE SHORTAGE PROBLEM -- BUT WILL GO A LONG WAY TO HELP CREATE THE INCENTIVES NEEDED TO INCREASE THE PIPELINE OF QUALIFIED TEACHERS. IN THESE SUBJECT SHORTAGE AREAS -- AND SO WITH THAT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR.

TO LOOK AT HOW WE'RE GOING TO RECRUIT AND HOW WE'RE GOING TO SUPPORT -- TEACHERS COMING INTO THE STATE. WHAT I'D LIKE FOR US TO DO AS A COMMITTEE IS LOOK AT ALL OF THESE PROGRAMS WE KEEP PASSING? OF CONCERNING SUPPORTING TEACHERS IN GRANTS HAVING HEARD THREE TODAY. TWO OR THREE AND WE'VE HEARD SOME OTHERS IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAM RUN BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. TO SUPPORT TEACHERS I MEAN IT BECAUSE IT'S AFFECT THE WAY THAT IS NOW IT'S ONE HERE ONE HERE ONE HERE. AND STUDENTS MAY EVEN BE MORE CONFUSES SO WHERE DO I GO. RATHER THAN LOOKING AT A COORDINATED EFFORT AND MAYBE WE WANT TO LOOK AT THAT AS THE HIGHER IT COMMITTEE A COORDINATED EFFORT TO TALK ABOUT IT BECAUSE I THINK WE'VE HEARD A COUPLE TODAY. NONE OF THEM WERE OPPOSED TO BUT YOUGET SO MANY THEN IS TO PICK AND CHOOSE AND YOU'RE NOT SURE IF WHAT WE'RE GETTING REALLY ADDRESSES THE ISSUES THAT WE WANT TO DRESS OR DO CALL THE RECRUITMENT THAT WE WANT TO A GROUP. WE SHOULD HAVE A STANDARD PROGRAM IN THE STATE AT SOME POINT THAT MEET CERTAIN KINDS OF NEEDS BUT REALLY AS YOUNG PEOPLE CAN GO TO KNOW THAT THIS IS WHAT OUR STATE DOES TO SUPPORT TEACHING SO. THAT'S JUST MY SUGGESTION AS WE GO FORWARD BECAUSE I KNOW THAT SOME OTHERS THAT ARE GONNA BE COMING ALONG. WE'VE HEARD THESE BEFORE AND AND IN THE AT THE END OF THE DAY I'M NOT EVEN SURE WHICH ONES GET SIGNED WHICH ONES DON'T GET SIGNED WHICH WON THE GOVERNOR SUPPORTS AND DOESN'T SUPPORT. SOMEONE SUGGEST THAT THOSE OF US WHO BELIEVE IN THERE SO THOSE WHO WORK TOGETHER GET TOGETHER AND BASICALLY GIVE US A COORDINATED COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAM THE HELP WAS SUPPORT. TEACHERS COMING IN THE PROFESSION AND AND THAT WAY WILL KNOW WHAT WE'RE DOING AND KNOW WHAT THE NOT WE'RE BEING AFFECTED. THANK YOU.

A SCHOLARSHIP -- EFFORT RELATED TO YOU KNOW MAKE SURE WE GET TEACHERS IN LOW PERFORMING SCHOOLS WHERE THIS IS REALLY MUCH DIFFERENT IN THE SENSE THAT OUR PRIORITY IS -- IN THE TRYING TO PREPARE CANDIDATES IN SUBJECT AREAS THAT ARE NEEDED THROUGHOUT YOU KNOW THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ALL SCHOOL DISTRICT AND ALL SCHOOLS -- BUT WE'RE CERTAINLY HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE GOVERNOR'S YOU KNOW OUR GOALS ARE -- NOW. THAT THE CONSISTENT [inaudible] AND NOTE. MOTION WAS BY MISTER LOW SECOND BY MISTER GABRIEL. AND SECRETARY PLEASE CALL. THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE EDUCATION COMMITTEE. MEDINA AYE MEDINA AYE CHOI. CHOI I JONES SAWYER. JONES SAWYER I'D BLOOM. BLOOM I GABRIEL. GABRIEL I IRWIN -- WHEN I KILEY? LEVINE LEVINE I LOW. LOW I PATTERSON PATTERSON I SANTIAGO [inaudible] WEBER [inaudible] WEBER I GEN ZERO THAT BILL IS OUT WE WILL LEAVE IT OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS. AND NEXT ITEM. SIXTEEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER SMITH WELCOME. WHICH ALSO ENJOYS SUPPORT SUPPORT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND COLLEAGUES FOR YOUR EARLY AN AMBITIOUS SUPPORT SO I WILL TRY. TO GET THROUGH THIS AND AND GIVE YOU THE FRAME AND WE WE WILL MOVE ON AS YOU'RE APPROACHING YOUR SEVENTH INNING STRETCH HERE. CALIFORNIA IS POISED TO EXPERIENCE DRAMATIC GROWTH IN THE NEED FOR NURSES THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR HEALTH WORKFORCE ANALYSIS ESTIMATES THAT CALIFORNIA COULD BE SHORT BY FORTY FIVE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED REGISTERED NURSES BY. TWENTY THIRTY THIS SHORTAGE COULD BE POINTED TO A RANGE OF ISSUES INCLUDING THE AGING BABY BOOMER POPULATION THE INCREASE OF CHRONIC HEALTH ISSUES LIKE OBESITY AND DIABETES AND A GROWING EMPHASIS ON PREVENTIVE CARE. AT THE SAME TIME SCHOOLS ARE STRUGGLING TO ACCOMMODATE THE NUMBERS OF STUDENTS SEEKING SPOTS AN IMPACTED NURSING PROGRAMS. PART OF THE REASON FOR THIS IMPACTION HAS BEEN THE DIFFICULTY IN RECRUITING AND RETAINING NURSING FACULTY. UNLIKE OTHER PROGRAMS NURSING REQUIRES EXTENSIVE CLINICAL COMPONENTS ON TOP OF THE TIME IN THE CLASSROOM. CLINICAL EDUCATION REQUIRES THAT STUDENTS PERFORM TWELVE HOUR SHIFTS ONE TO TWO DAYS PER WEEK. CLINICAL ROTATIONS MAY EXTEND FROM SIX TO EIGHTEEN WEEKS DEPENDING ON THE COURSE AND AVAILABILITY OF CLINICAL SITES. HOSPITAL CLINICAL SITES REQUIRE FOUR TO SIX OUR ORIENTATIONS FOR ANYONE PROVIDING PATIENT CARE INCLUDING BOTH NORTH NURSING STUDENTS AND THEIR FACULTY. DUE TO THE PRACTICAL ELEMENTS OF NURSING EDUCATION NURSING INSTRUCTORS MUST MEET A UNIQUE SET OF QUALIFICATIONS FROM OTHER COMMUNITY COLLEGE FACULTY. MANY CLINICAL NURSING INSTRUCTORS CONTINUE TO SERVE AS PRACTICING LICENSE NURSES WHILE TEACHING LEADING TO A LARGE NUMBER OF PART TIME NURSING FACULTY. UNDER EXISTING LAW COURSE LOADS FOR PART TIME COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND ADULT EDUCATION FACULTY ARE CAPPED AT 67% OF THE HOURS PER WEEK OF A FULL TIME COURSE LOAD. APPROXIMATELY TWO COURSES. THIS CAP RESULTS AN INSTRUCTOR CHANGES IN THE MIDDLE OF ROTATIONS INTERRUPTING THE STUDENTS LEARNING PROCESS AND INTERRUPTING CARE AT CLINICAL SITES. FOR STUDENTS THE CHANGE OF INSTRUCTORS MID ROTATION CAN BE DISRUPTIVE TO THE LEARNING PROCESS STUDENT EVALUATIONS MAY ALSO NOT BE AS COMPREHENSIVE NEW INSTRUCTORS MAY NOT BE FAMILIAR ENOUGH WITH A STUDENT'S PERFORMANCE TO EFFECTIVELY DETERMINE PROGRESSION AND SKILL DEVELOPMENT. STUDENTS MAY BE ALLOWED MAY NOT BE ALLOWED TO ADVANCE WHEN THEY'RE NOT PREPARED. THE MID ROTATION TURNOVER IS ALSO DISRUPTIVE FOR CLINICAL SITES. EACH TIME A NEW INSTRUCTORS BROUGHT INTO A HOSPITAL THE HOSPITAL MUST PROVIDE TO THE INSTRUCTOR THE REQUISITE FOUR TO SIX HOUR ORIENTATION STACKING ONTO ALREADY BUSY SCHEDULES FOR ABOUT THE HOSPITAL AN INSTRUCTOR. CLINICAL SITES TYPICALLY HAVE TO HOST STUDENTS FROM SEVERAL SCHOOLS THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF INSTRUCTORS FROM EACH SCHOOL FOR MULTIPLE COURSES TURNING OVER IN THE MIDDLE OF EACH ROTATION CAN SEVERELY INTERRUPT CLINICAL OPERATIONS. FACULTY TURNOVER CAN ALSO A ROAD THE CLINICAL SITES CONFIDENCE IN AN EDUCATION INSTITUTION AND INSTRUCTORS. THE MID ROTATION TURNOVER IS ALSO DESTRUCTIVE FOR THE CLINICAL SITE. EACH TIME A NEW INSTRUCTORS BROUGHT INTO A HOSPITAL THE HOSPITAL MUST PROVIDE THE INSTRUCTOR THE REQUISITE FORTY SIX OUR ORIENTATION. AND THEY'RE ALREADY STOCKING ON TO THEIR BUSY HOSPITAL A ADMINISTRATIVE DUTIES. CLINICAL SITES TYPICALLY HAVE HOUSE STUDENTS FROM SEVERAL SCHOOLS. THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF INSTRUCTORS FROM EACH SCHOOL FOR MULTIPLE COURSES TURNING OVER IN THE MIDDLE OF EACH ROTATION CAN SEVERELY IMPACT OPERATIONS. AB TEN FIFTY ONE WOULD RE ESTABLISH AN EXEMPTION INITIALLY PUT IN STATUTE IN TWO THOUSAND SIX FOR PART TIME COMMUNITY COLLEGE NURSING FACULTY. TO EXCEED THE PART TIME FACULTY COURSE LOAD CAP ALLOWING FOR MORE CONTINUITY IN CLINICAL NURSING EDUCATION. THE EXEMPTION WOULD PERMIT FULL TIME CLINICAL NURSING FACULTY OR PART TIME CLINICAL NURSING FACULTY TO BE EMPLOYED BY ANY ONE COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT FOR UP TO FOUR SEMESTERS OR SIX QUARTERS. THE REESTABLISHMENT OF THE EXEMPTION WOULD ALLOW COMMUNITY COLLEGES ACROSS THE STATE TO SERVE AT LEAST THREE HUNDRED FIFTY ONE ADDITIONAL STUDENTS PER YEAR IN NURSING PROGRAMS AND WOULD ENCOURAGE THE HIRING PRACTISE AND PRACTICING. A LICENSE NURSES WHO WILL BRING VALUABLE AND RELEVANT REAL WORLD EXPERIENCE INTO THE EDUCATIONAL ENVIRONMENT. I HAVE WITH ME A FEW WITNESSES TODAY TO TESTIFY TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF TEN FIFTY ONE AND REMEMBER WE WERE UP. TO PASS. JUSTIN SELLECK ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES BOARD OF GOVERNORS THE SPONSOR OF AB. TEN FIFTY ONE AND IN THE INTEREST OF TIME ALL ALLOW OUR WITNESSES TO TAKE THE A LOT OF TIME WE HAVE -- DOCTOR SANDRA MELTON FROM THE SCHOOL OF NURSING AT VENTURA COLLEGE AND SHERRIN GOLDFARB FOR THE SOVIET DEAN OF HEALTH AT LOS MADONNA'S COLLEGE. THANK YOU -- GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS OF 50% OR FIVE FULL TIME NURSING FACULTY POSITIONS ARE CURRENTLY OPEN AT VENTURA COLLEGE. IN MY TEN YEARS AS THE PROGRAM DIRECTOR THERE I'VE NEVER HAD A FULL COMPLEMENT OF FULL TIME FACULTY. AND HAVE DONE A HIRING COMMITTEE EVERY SEMESTER FOR TWENTY SEMESTERS WITH MANY COMMITTEES RESULTING IN A FAILED SEARCH OR A SUCCESSFUL APPLICANT OFFERED THE POSITION. ONLY TO TURN IT DOWN TO TWO VERY LOW SALARY OFFERED. THIS SEMESTER I WAS FORCED TO REDUCE MY ADMISSIONS BY 20%. FOR THE GENERIC ASSOCIATE DEGREE NURSING PROGRAM AND A 100% FOR THE ADVANCED PLACEMENT LV AND TO OUR AN OPTION BECAUSE OF LACK OF FACULTY. THE ABILITY TO UTILIZE PART TIME FACULTY AS TEMPORARY FULL TIME FACULTY WOULD HAVE SAVED THESE SPOTS WITH MINIMAL COST TO THE COLLEGE COMPARED TO HIRING AN ADDITIONAL TENURE TRACK FACULTY. THE COLLEGES ONLY EXPENSE WOULD BE FULL TIME BENEFITS FOR THE PART TIME FACULTY BUT THOSE WOULD BE INCURRED FOR ONLY ONE TO FOUR SEMESTERS RATHER THAN OVER THE CAREER SPAN OF THE TENURE TRACK FACULTY. MOREOVER THE COLLEGE WOULD SAY THE EXPENSIVE RECRUITMENT COST OF ADVERTISING FOR HIRING AN ORIENTING NEW FACULTY. CONTINUED REDUCTIONS IN ADMISSIONS WILL HAVE DISASTROUS RAMIFICATIONS FOR HOSPITALS AND CLINICAL AGENCIES THAT RELY ON NEW NURSES FROM COMMUNITY COLLEGE PROGRAMS. MOREOVER IT WILL NEGATIVELY AFFECT STUDENTS LIVES STUDENTS WHO PARTICIPATE IN THE INTER COLLEGE NURSING PROGRAM BURSTS THAT BOOST THEIR EARNINGS BY AN AMAZING FOUR HUNDRED AND 12%. A 100% OF STUDENTS IN THIS PROGRAM GET A JOB IN THEIR FIELD OF STUDY AND 86% OF STUDENTS ATTAIN. THE REGIONAL LIVING WAGE PLEASE SUPPORT THIS BILL SO THAT WE MAY CONTINUE TO ADMIT AND EDUCATE NURSES TO MEET. THE HEALTH WORKFORCE NEEDS OF INTER COUNTY AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

MISTER CHAIR OF TO OUR MEDINA AND MEMBERS THIS AFTERNOON I'M HERE TO PRESENT TO YOU AB. THREE SIX NINE A BILL RELATING TO THE STRUCTURE OF SALARIES FOR C. ISSUE EMPLOYEES. I LIKE TO SAY THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON ADDRESSING THE CONCERNS IN ANALYSIS ABOUT REDUCING PROGRAM FOR STUDENTS AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON THAT. FOLLOWING IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX THE IMPASSE IN CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS THE CSU BOARD OF TRUSTEES UNILATERALLY ELIMINATED EXISTING EMPLOYEES STEP SALLY STEPS. INCREASING TIES TO JOB PERFORMANCE AND LONGEVITY. THIS HAS RESULTED IN NEW HIRES EARNING HIGHER SALARIES THAN EXISTING EMPLOYEES WHO WORKED IN THE SAME CLASSIFICATION FOR MANY YEARS. THIS IN EQUITY HAS CREATED A NINETY FIVE POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IN VIRGIN GAP BETWEEN THE SALARIES OF NEWLY HIRED AND LONG EMPLOYED SEE ISSUE STAFF. FOR TWO DECADES THE C. ISSUE HAS BEEN UNWILLING TO REINSTATE SALARY STEPS DESPITE THE FAILURE OF THE EXISTING SAU STRUCTURE AND THE INABILITY OF EMPLOYEES TO OUR IN A FAIR AND EQUITABLE WAY. AB TWELVE THIRTY ONE WILL REINSTATE 5% SALLY STEPS FOR CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY SUPPORT STAFF. THE INCREASE WILL BE MADE ANNUALLY WHEN EMPLOYEES MEET THE STANDARDS OF SATISFACTORY PERFORMANCE AS DETERMINED BY THE EMPLOYEES ADMINISTRATORS. HERE WITH ME TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF AB THREE SIX NIGHT IS TERRY WILSON WHO WORKS AT FRESNO STATE UNIVERSITY. AND CAL MASON WHO IS A MEMBER OF THE TEAMSTERS LOCAL TWENTY TEN AT SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY. AND DAVID BELL HAWKINS FROM THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY EMPLOYEES UNION -- WE'LL HAVE BEEN PRESENT NOW OKAY. WE HAVE FOUR MINUTES SO I'LL TRY OKAY. NOT PER PERSON OKAY YEAH OKAY. ALL MEANS THE END STAND YEAH. OKAY GOT IT -- MY NAME IS TERRY WILSON I'M AN ELEVEN YEAR EMPLOYEE AT FRESNO STATE. SALAR STEPS ARE NOT RAISES RAISES SUCH AS GENERAL SALARY INCREASES IN COLAS ARE NEGOTIATED AND HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH EMPLOYEES PERFORMANCE. ALL WE ARE ASKING FOR IS PARITY WITH THE OTHER AGENCIES IN OVER TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND OTHER STATE EMPLOYEES. I WAS FIRST HIRED IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN AS AN ADMINISTRATIVE ANALYST OVERSAW THE BUDGET IN THE ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT. GIVEN IT WORKING IS. THAT -- ASSISTED WITH WORKING WITH THE VICE PRESIDENT FOR STUDENT AFFAIRS WHICH REQUIRED INCREASE STAFF OVERSIGHT AND BUDGET RESPONSIBILITIES. I NOW RUN THE BULLDOG ID CARD OFFICE IN IN THE IMAGING DEPARTMENT THIRTEEN EMPLOYEES WORKING DIRECTLY UNDER ME I PRIDE PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO THE MINISTRY OF SERVICES DEPARTMENT AND UNIVERSITY CONTROLLER. I HAVE AN UNDERGRADUATE DEGREE WITH AN EMPHASIS IN MATHEMATICS SCIENCE AND BIOLOGY I HAVE TWO MASTERS DEGREES. DESPITE MY EDUCATION. CHANGES IN MY JOB RESPONSIBILITY WORKLOADS. I CONSISTENT RECEIVING OUTSTANDING EVALUATIONS. I HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANY MERIT SALARY INCREASE AT FRESNO STATE ELEVEN YEARS. HAVING FURTHER INSULT NEW EMPLOYEES ARE BEING HIRED IN THE SAME JOB CLASSIFICATION AS ME AND EARNING A HIGHER SALARY. NOT WITHSTANDING MY EXPERIENCE THAT IS SHARED BY THOUSANDS OF OTHER EMPLOYEES CSU MANAGERS AND SUPERVISORS DO RECEIVE AN ANNUAL. MERIT SALARY INCREASE DESPITE CRITICISM OF A STATE AUDIT RELEASED IN. TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THE STATE AUDIT ALSO FOUND THAT SEEKS TO MANAGEMENT POSITIONS GREAT TWICE THE RATE OF SUPPORT STAFF. WITH HALF A BILLION. DOLLARS PER YEAR IN TOTAL COMPENSATION FAR OUTPACING THE SALARY OF STUFF. AGAIN WE ARE ASKING FOR IS PARITY WITH OTHER STATE EMPLOYEES. I SHOULDN'T BE FINANCIALLY PENALIZED FOR WORKING AT THE CSU. NOR SHOULD DO EMPLOYEES BE HIRED FOR THE SAME JOB SOUTH CLASSIFICATION THAT I'VE WORKED THAT FOR YEARS. AND BE GIVEN A HIGHER SALARY. I'M ASKING TO BE FAIRLY COMPENSATED AND TREATED WITH RESPECT. AFTER OVER TWENTY YEARS OF INEQUITY I'M ASKING THE CSU SUPPORT STAFF BE MADE WHOLE AGAIN I URGE YOU TO SUPPORT A. B. THREE SIX NINE THANK YOU. MEDINA MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- DAVID BALLOT HAWK INTERPRETING THE CSU EMPLOYEES UNION -- YOU HAVE SOME HANDOUTS -- THE SERGEANT IS -- PASSING OUT RIGHT NOW ONE OF THEM IS A CHART. SHOWING THE INVERSION THAT HAS BEEN CREATED FROM A LACK OF SALARY STEPS. SO ON AVERAGE NEW HIRES FOR THE SAME POSITION ON THE SAME CAMPUS. ARE EARNING OVER SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS MORE A MONTH. THE EMPLOYEES WHO HAVE BEEN THERE FOR LONG TERM PERIOD. IT'S ABOUT AN 18% DIFFERENTIAL BETWEEN NEW HIRES AND THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN THERE FOR TEN FIFTEEN YEARS. TERRY MENTIONED THE ART AT THE DOCTOR WEBER AUTHORED -- STATE AUDIT THAT WAS DONE IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN I JUST WANTED A RE EMPHASIZE A COUPLE OF POINTS. SO THE AUDITOR FOUND THAT MID MANAGEMENT LEVEL POSITIONS THE MANAGERS SUPERVISORS GREW AT TWICE THE RATE MORE THAN DOUBLE THE RATE OF OF SEE IF YOU SUPPORT STAFF. IN THAT THEIR COMPENSATION HAS NOW REACHED A HALF A BILLION DOLLARS. THE AUDITOR CONCLUDED THAT THE SEE IF YOU COULD NOT JUSTIFY. THIS SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN PERSONNEL. AND IN THE COMPENSATION. THE AUDITOR ALSO CONCLUDED THAT THE C. ISSUES THAT WERE LOOKED AT QUOTE DO NOT ADEQUATELY OVERSEE THEIR BUDGETS. WHICH QUOTE REDUCE ASSURANCES THAT STATE FENDER BEING SPENT EFFICIENTLY AND APPROPRIATELY. SO WE BECAME CURIOUS ABOUT WHAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING TO COMPENSATION FUND SO WE FOUND THIS AUDIT WHICH YOU HAVE A COPY OF THIS IS FROM OCTOBER TO A TWENTY THIRTEEN THIS WAS NOT AT THAT THE ELAINE HOW DID OF AGENCIES THAT HAVE OUTSIDE THE CAMP WE DIDN'T KNOW THAT THE SEE. IF YOU HAD NAY OUTSIDE ACCOUNT SO THE USER ACCOUNTS ARE NOT UNDER THE OVERSIGHT. OR ACCOUNTABILITY OF THE STATE TREASURY. YOU'LL SEE IN TWO THOUSAND NINE TEN THE HIGHLIGHTED SECTION. DURING A TIME WHEN WE WERE DOING EMPLOYEE LAYOFFS AND FURLOUGHS. IN STUDENT TUITION WITH SKYROCKETING. THE CSU BANG. SIX HUNDRED AND EIGHTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS. INTO AN OUTSIDE ACCOUNT THAT WAS OUTSIDE THE STATE TREASURY. WE REPEAT THAT. WE ARE LAYING OFF AND FOR ALLOWING EMPLOYEES. STUDENT TUITION IS GOING UP. IN THE CSU PROFIT SIX HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS SO WE WORK WITH THE SENATE. AND WITH MISTER SANTIAGO. TO DO A REQUEST TO THE CSU THAT YOUR OTHER DOCUMENT ABOUT THE OUTSIDE ACCOUNTS ON PAGE TWO OF THAT DOCUMENT WHICH IS SIGNED BY CHANCE FOR WHITE. AND YOUR YOUR YOUR TIME IS ACTUALLY EXPIRED SO IF YOU COULD WRAP IT UP PLEASE. I WILL SIR. IN JUNE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT YOU'LL SEE A BALANCE IN THESE OUTSIDE ACCOUNT TO ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS THAT'S WITH THE BE. IT GREW TO THREE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS TEN YEARS LATER. OF THAT MONEY NEARLY TWO BILLION DOLLARS IS DISCRETIONARY ONGOING FUNDING. SO FOR THE CSU TO CLAIM THAT THEY DON'T HAVE MONEY TO DO THIS. WHEN HAVE CLEARLY PROFITED FROM THE ABUSE OF THESE EMPLOYEES? WE THINK IS A RATHER HYPOCRITICAL WHEN WE ASK YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU. IF OTHER WITNESSES YOUR TIME IS UP FOR MINUTES IS THE TIME ALLOTTED. CAN DIVIDE IT ANYWAY YOU WANT BUT IT'S FOUR MINUTES SO NEXT WITNESSES OF PLEASE JUST YOUR NAME AND THE ORGANIZATION YOU REPRESENT OKAY. SURE.

AND SUPPORT IN THE BILL. GOOD AFTERNOON SANDRA BARRERA ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. BRIAN HOW IT CALIFORNIA FEDERATION OF TEACHERS WERE A STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION HELLO. GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU MARTINEZ CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY -- WE MUST REALLY BEWE MUST RESPECT WILL BE OPPOSED AS MEASURE AS OPPOSED TO THE PREVIOUS BIRD VERSION OF THE BILL BUT TWELVE THIRTY ONE FROM LAST YEAR. UP I WOULD LIKE TO KIND OF JUST HIGHLIGHT THE THREE REASONS WHY WERE OPPOSED THE MEASURE AND THEN ALSO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE THE ACCOUNTS THAT. A MISTER BALL HAWKINS REYES AND I'LL HEAD OVER THAT TO TRANSFORM BACK. ARE SUCH A VICE CHANCELLOR FOR LABOR RELATIONS TO TALK ABOUT IN QUESTION YOU HAVE ABOUT THE SCOPE OF THE BILL. FIRST OF ALL WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THIS BILL BECAUSE WE BELIEVE IT TAKES AWAY FROM THE CSU STABILITY OF THE MORE JUSTICE TO MATCHES IN PLACE IT TAKES AWAY FROM OUR COLLECTIVE BARGAINING PROCESS. AND IT PUTS INTO A BILL INTO LEGISLATION. AND GIVE THE BY PRESENTS ARGUMENT -- FOR ALMOST ALL OF OUR PULLED BOYS CALLED SUPPORT STAFF FOR THE NEXT TEN YEARS THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT COST THE SYSTEM. THOSE COSTS ARE ARE GONNA BE QUICKLY COMING OUT OF OTHER POTS OF FROM THE CAMPS OPERATIONS WE ARE. WE GOT THROUGH TO BILLING DOLLARS FROM THE LEGISLATURE THE GOVERNOR EX I'M SORRY. IT'S PROPOSED IN THE BUDGET. THOSE ARE THE REAL DOLLARS THAT'S GONNA SUPPORT THE COMPETITION AGREES INCREASES THAT WE CAME TO AGREEMENT WITH OUR LABOR GROUPS -- THAT'S GOING TO BE THIRTY FIVE DOLLARS OR SO THAT'S PART OF THOSE WHICH WERE GRADUATION INITIATIVE ALL THOSE DOLLARS OF YOUR DOLLARS THAT WE HAVEN'T GOT HAVEN'T SPOKEN. FOR HOW TO PAY FOR A 5% FONG GOING IS BEYOND ME. BRING THAT DON'T WE ALSO ARE OPPOSE HIS MAGIC AS WE DON'T BELIEVE THIS BILL ADDRESSES IN VERSION BECAUSE IF THIS BILL WERE GONNA PULL INTO PLACE. ALL EMPLOYEES WITHIN THE SCHOOL WOULD RAISE BY PERCENT. YOU DO NEED A SATISFACTORY -- EVALUATION WE JUST BE 95290% OF EMPLOYEES WILL RECEIVE SUSPECT ROOMS -- VALUATION BECAUSE IT'S ON A SCALE FIVE IMMEDIATELY SO. THREE IT COMES TO THE ACCOUNTS THEY ALSO COUNTS THIS WAS AN AUDIT ITEM. I WANNA BE VERY CLEAR WITH YOU. THE LEGISLATURE. GAVE THE AUTHORITY TO WORK JUST TO STUDENTS TO OUT RUN THESE COUNTS OUTSIDE THE STATE CONTROLLER'S AUTHORITY. THOSE COUNTS ARE TIGHT SPECIFICALLY TO A SPECIFIC OBLIGATIONS SO HEALTH FACILITIES PARKING -- HOUSING ALL THE HAVE A VERY SPECIFIC PURPOSE THE CSU IS NOT IN THE BUSINESS OF A SUSPECT AS A MATTER OF FACT COUPLE YEARS AGO MR BLOCK. X. INCREASE THE ABILITY OF THE BOARD JUST TO USE TO INVEST MONEY AGGRESSIVELY MORE AGGRESSIVELY THAN THE CURRENTLY PREVIOUSLY HAD. THOUSAND FORTY BROUGHT TO GIVEN TO US BY THE LEGISLATURE. SO I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE YOU ALL UNDERSTAND HERE IS NO SLUSH FUNDS ALL THE MONIES THAT ARE AT THE OUTSIDE THE CONTROLS OFFICE ARE SPOKEN FOR AND THAT ARE GRANTED OVER JOHN SORT. A GOOD AFTERNOON. SO I APPRECIATE THIS IS A POLICY COMMITTEE SO I LIMIT MY OBJECTIONS TO POLICY. UNDER HERO. AND THE DEFINITION OF SCOPE OF REPRESENTATION WE HAVE WAGES HOURS AND OTHER TIMES AND CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT. WHAT THIS BILL WOULD DO IS ESSENTIALLY REMOVE WAGES FROM THE SCOPE OF COLLECTIVE BARGAINING? HI AND IF THAT WERE TO BE THE CASE. THEN THAT WOULD HAVE A VERY SERIOUS NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE ABILITY OF MANAGEMENT AND LABOR TO COME TOGETHER NEGOTIATE COLLECTIVELY. THIS BILL AS DRAFTED AS AND EXPLAIN WOULD ACTUALLY CATCH PROBABLY HI 90% OF OUR STAFF EMPLOYEES ARE NOT FACULTY EMPLOYEES -- WOULD DO ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES WHICH WERE RAISED WE KNOW WE HAVE SALARY STRUCTURE ISSUES -- WITH. OUR STAFF EMPLOYEES WE HAVE WORKING GROUPS ESTABLISHED IN ORDER TO DISCUSS THOUGHT OUTSIDE THE BARGAINING CYCLE. BUT SIMPLY A BROUGHT ACROSS THE BOARD STROKES OF GIVING 5% FOR SATISFACTORY EVALUATION REPEATED OF TEN YEARS IRRESPECTIVE OF THE PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH THE CSU WILL HAVE TO OPERATE DURING THOSE TEN YEARS. AT A SOMETHING WHICH THE ADMINISTRATION JUST CAN'T POSSIBLY SUPPORT. AND THEN FINALLY JUST ON THE POLICY SIDE. THESE ISSUES HAVING VERSION COMPRESSION THE COMPLEX AND THE COMPLICATED THEY DIFFER BY REGION THAT DIFFER BY CAMPUS. AND THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING PROCESS IS BY FAR AND AWAY THE BEST MEANS OF RESOLVING THAT -- IMPOSING THIS IS A UNFUNDED MANDATES WOULD ONLY BE DESTRUCTIVE OF THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING. ENVIRONMENTS AND DESCRIPTIVE OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PARTIES. THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION [inaudible] ANY TWEENER. STEPHANIE GOLDMAN OF THE FACULTY ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES OUR BOARD HAS NOT TAKEN AN OFFICIAL POSITION ON THIS BUT WE SUPPORT THE SPIRIT OF THE BILL AND STAND IN SOLIDARITY. ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE MISTER PATTERSON. AB. MEMBERS AND MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU I VOTED FOR THIS BILL LAST TIME I'M GONNA VOTE FOR IT AGAIN. I APPRECIATE -- YOU BRING THIS FORWARD AGAIN -- THIS HAS A LOT TO DO WITH. MY ALMA MATER AND FRESNO STATE. AND FRIENDS THAT I HAVE KNOWN FOR A LONG LONG TIME IN THESE KINDS OF POSITIONS. AND WHAT I FIND OUT THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE. MAKING SURE THAT BULLDOG STADIUM IS FIRST RATE WHEN WE BEAT UCLA OUR AND OTHERS WHO ARE IN THESE SUPPORT STAFF POSITIONS. UP FINDING THEMSELVES HAVING. TO STACK SHELVES AND SEVEN ELEVEN WITH A SECOND JOB. WHILE WE SIT IN THE RED SECTION. AND ENJOY A WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE. AND WHEN I DISCOVERED THAT THIS WAS THE CIRCUMSTANCE OF PEOPLE THAT I REALLY CARE ABOUT AND HAVEN'T GOTTEN TO KNOW FOR A LONG LONG TIME. THE I AM IN SUPPORT. AND I'M ALSO ON A A PURELY WAGE AND REWARD [inaudible] DECISION [inaudible] YOU KNOW [inaudible] MANAGEMENT [inaudible] FACULTY. EXECUTIVES SEEM. TO DO PRETTY WELL. THIS GROUP OF EMPLOYEES I THINK HAVE BEEN [inaudible] LEFT BEHIND. AND SO I'M GOING TO WEAR OUT. VOTE IN SUPPORT ON THIS. AND I SURE HOPE IT. YES BEYOND THIS COMMITTEE AND GETS TO A GOVERNOR WHO WILL SIGN IT. SO WHEN I GO TO MY NEXT FRESNO STATE FOOTBALL GAME. I DON'T HAVE THE PANGS OF GUILT THE SERIOUSLY. OF AN OF AN ALARM. OF A GREAT UNIVERSITY. THAT WOULD HAVE SUPPORT STAFF LIVING THE WAY THEY DO. THANK YOU [inaudible] MR LEVINE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND OCTOBER THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL BACK LAST YEAR I HAD VOTED NO IN COMMITTEE AND I VOTED AYE. ON THE FLOOR I'M GONNA PROBABLY AT LEAST KEEP TO THE FIRST PATTERN OF VOTING KNOWING COMMITTEE AT THIS POINT -- I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE DOING AND I WOULD LOVE TO HAND OUT RAISES THAT WOULD BE A FUN DAY EVERY DAY IN THIS JOB -- BUT THAT IS NOT WHAT WE DO YOU GUYS ENGAGE IN COLLECTIVE BARGAINING I WOULD NEVER. TAKE SOMETHING AWAY THAT YOU GAIN IN COLLECTIVE BARGAINING -- OR TAKE SOMETHING AWAY FROM THE CSU THAT THEY HAD. DIED HAD RECEIVED IN COLLECTIVE BARGAINING SO IT'S IT'S AN AWKWARD SITUATION FOR US TO BE IN. TO T. PLACE IN THIS. SHOULD THERE BE. ECONOMIC MOBILITY FOR EMPLOYEES AND I I FUNDAMENTALLY BELIEVE THAT THERE SHOULD BE JUST AS WE HOPE THAT THERE IS ECONOMIC MOBILITY FOR STUDENTS IN THIS ISSUE I THINK FOR THE WORK FORCE THERE SHOULD BE AS WELL. SO I THINK WHAT I WOULD JUST ASK OF THE CSU IS TO MAKE SURE THAT I HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE INFORMATION AS THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD IF IT MOVES FORWARD -- TO UNDERSTAND WHAT HAS BEEN GAINED AND LOST IN THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING PROCESS SO YOU KNOW WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS HAPPENING WELL IF WE'RE GONNA BE ASKED TO REFEREE THIS. I JUST WANT TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE INFORMATION BEFORE THIS THING GOES TO THE FLOOR -- BUT AGAIN I I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE DOING AND AND YOU KNOW WE WANT TO LIFT EVERYONE UP -- ESPECIALLY THE POOREST PEOPLE WORKING FOR AN AMAZING INSTITUTION LIKE THIS YES YOU SHOULD HAVE PEOPLE THAT ARE PAID WITH DIGNITY. AND AND SO I APPRECIATE THE THE EFFORT THAT YOU'RE PUTTING FOR DR JOY. I THOUGHT I'D GIVE THEM A CHANCE TO ANSWER. I THINK IT WAS JUST ARE GONNA FOR EIGHT RIGHT [inaudible] OKAY [inaudible] USE ME [inaudible] THE OUT. PAY INEQUITY I HEAR THE PROBLEM AND THE HOW WE CAN ADDRESS OF INTO US WHAT YOUR BILL IS ARE TRYING -- TO MAKE UP BUT TWO QUESTIONS THAT I HAVE IS THAT -- HOW YOU GONNA MAKE UP BUT THE CURRENT -- INEQUITY SITUATION. FOR THE PEOPLE WHO ARE -- BUT LESS PAID THE WITH THE LONGER OR LONGEVITY. OF WHEN YOUR EMPLOYEES SAW. WITH THERE BE A CATCH UP A SPECIAL FUND. AND HOW MUCH OF THAT WOULD BE OUR FOR THE TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES SO CH CSU SYSTEM. NUMBER. TWO QUESTION IS THAT THE WHY IT IS SO OFTEN I MEAN I HAS HAPPENED IF THIS WAS THAT THROUGH THE OF COLLECTIVE BARGAINING -- NEGOTIATIONS. I'M I'M SURE THE I UNION GIVEN CERTAIN PERCENTAGE IF THERE'S A ACTIVELY DISTRIBUTED. OUR AND THEN. THAT THE PEOPLE WHO. I HAVE BEEN WORKING THERE LONGER PERIOD. I SHOULD BEEN TAKEN CARE OF HOW WOULD. JUST A DISTRICT IN EQUITY HAS HAPPENED -- LET ME LET ME SAY FIRST OF ALL OF THEM. THE INVERSION ISSUE IS AN ISSUE THAT'S BEING ADDRESSED ANOTHER WAY IN PEOPLE'S MENTION HERE BUT THIS BILL IS NOT THE SOLUTION TO THE INVERSION FIRST OF ALL THAT WAS JUST MENTIONED SHOW YOU HOW BAD THINGS GOT. THIS BILL IS ABOUT RESTORING THE MERIT INCREASES OF THAT CAN HAPPEN FOR AN INDIVIDUAL -- AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT WHILE WE GIVE PAY HOMMAGE TO COLLECTIVE BARGAINING. AND I WAS ONE OF THE PEOPLE WAY BACK IN THE DAY WITH YOU P. C. AND THEN CFA THAT ACTUALLY GOT COLLECTIVE BARGAINING IF THIS IF THIS ISSUE SYSTEM THAT WAS ONE OF THE THINGS I DID IN THE SEVENTIES -- BUT THIS WAS DONE OUTSIDE OF COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AND THAT'S WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND IT WOULD BE DIFFERENT IF THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT HAVE BEEN COLLECTIVELY BARGAIN. NOW THE SYSTEM PAYS HOMMAGE TO COLLECTIVE BARGAINING WHEN IT'S TO THEIR ADVANTAGE. BUT WHEN IS NOT TO THEIR ADVANTAGE THEY DO WHAT THEY WANT TO DO. AND THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED IN THE SITUATION AND IT NOT ONLY HAPPENED TO THESE FOLKS BUT IT HAPPENED AB ALMOST EVERYBODY IN SYSTEM. AND SO WHAT HAPPENED WAS THEY DECIDED TO ELIMINATE STEP INCREASES THE MERIT STEP INCREASES. NOT SINCE THEN THE OTHERS HAVE GONE BACK AND GOTTEN MERIT STEP INCREASES THE VARIOUS FORMS THEY HAVE REFUSED TO BARK TO GET TO GET THIS THIS PARTICULAR GROUP THE STEP INCREASES SO THEY'RE THE ONLY ONES NOW. WITHOUT THE 5% MERIT INCREASE POSSIBILITY THAT THAT DOESN'T MEAN YOU GET EVERY YEAR. AND IT'S NOT LIKE GETTING A RAISE WHEN YOU GET A RAISE AT THE SYSTEM WE GIVE THREE POINT FOUR TWO POINT WHATEVER RAISES. EVERYBODY GETS A RAISE OKAY WE UNDERSTAND THAT APPEAR BECAUSE THAT HAPPENS OCCASIONALLY WHERE EVERYBODY GETS A RAISE. BUT THEN WHEN YOU CAN DO ASSESSMENT AND EVALUATE YOUR FACULTY OR YOUR STAFF YOU CAN YOU CAN INCREASE THOSE WAYS THAT YOU CAN DO. THERE'S MERIT KINDS OF RACES THAT ARE THERE THIS IS A SYSTEM OF MAD WHEN I CAME INTO THIS ISSUE EVERYBODY HAD THE POSSIBILITY 5%. INCREASES. THEN THEY TOOK IT AWAY WITHOUT BARGAINING AND IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN BARGAIN BUT IT WAS NOT. SO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS CORRECT SOMETHING THAT WAS DONE OUTSIDE OF THE BARGAINING THAT WAS REALLY UNFAIR AND UNJUST. AND EVERYBODY'S COAST TALK ABOUT BARGAINING WHEN THIS WAS TAKEN AWAY WITHOUT BARGAINING WHAT WAS SIMPLY TRYING TO DO IS PUT THIS PARTICULAR GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS BACK INTO THE SAME STRUCTURE AS EVERYONE ELSE AT THE UNIVERSITY. THAT ALLOWS THEM TO BASICALLY GET MERIT INCREASES THAT OF THE YEAR NOW THE INVERSION PIECE HAS OCCURRED BECAUSE OF ALL THE STUFF THAT HAPPENS AT THE UNIVERSITY. AND I CAN TESTIFY TO THE HOW HORRIBLE AND HOW DEMORALIZING INVERSION ME IS BECAUSE AS I WORK AT THE UNIVERSAL FORTY YEARS AFTER ABOUT TWENTY FIVE YEARS I HAD PEOPLE I WAS HIRING MAKING MORE MONEY THAN I WAS. AND IT TOOK A MAJOR ACT BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE CAMPUS TO INCREASE MY SALARY BECAUSE I HAD BEEN SUPERVISING PEOPLE MAKING MORE THAN I WAS BECAUSE OF THAT NEGOTIATIONS. AND ALL THE INVERSION STUFF THAT HAPPENED IT WAS STOLEN JUST. AND IS STILL A LOT OF THIS IN THE SYSTEM THAT NEEDS TO BE CLEANED OUT AND CLARIFIED AND IT'S ME. IN ITS EVEN MORE DEMORALIZING WHEN YOU CONSIDER THAT -- YOU KNOW WE WE GIVE AS WHAT WAS HAPPENING MINISTERS ARE GETTING MAJOR INCREASES. SUPPOSEDLY MERIT INCREASES WITHOUT ANY PERFORMANCE. NOW AS A A CHAIR OF A DEPARTMENT I HAD TO EVALUATE MY FACULTY EVERY YEAR. I HAD TO GIVE THEM GOALS AND OBJECTIVES AND SO FORTH AND SO ON BUT I HAD NO ABILITY AT ALL AT THAT POINT. TO SAY AND AS A RESULT THIS PROB GOING TO RECOMMEND THIS PERSON FOR ME ARE THE CHESTNUT. BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T HAVE IT. AS THEY HAD IN OTHER AREAS. AND SO WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IS AN INJUSTICE THAT OCCURRED. WHEN THEY DECIDED THE ADMINISTRATION TOOK THE MERIT OUT OF THE MERIT STEPPED OUT OF OUT OF THE ABILITY OF THESE FOLKS WHO WORK THERE? AND THEY HAVE BEEN STRUGGLING EVER SINCE TO BRING BACK BUT IT WAS NOT TAKEN IN THE NORMAL PROCESS WHICH WOULD BEEN TO COLLECTIVE BARGAINING. MAY I DON'T WANT PEOPLE CAN UNDERSTAND THE STRUCTURE THAT HAS HAPPENED AND WHY THIS IS BEING BROUGHT HERE I WOULD NOT HAVE BROUGHT IT IF IT HAD BEEN NEGOTIATED NAY LOST THE GHOST ASIANS OF THIS DATA THAT. THEY TOOK IT WITHOUT NEGOTIATIONS. BEFORE I GO TO VOTE BOTH OF THE LIKE WHATEVER'S BUT I I HAVE MEMBERS WHO SURE -- I THINK STILL HAVE QUESTIONS SO WHAT ARE THE MEMBERS FIRST. MY QUESTION GOES TO THE YES. GO AHEAD MR ROOM ON THE UHHUH. FIRST I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE -- ARE A A FRIEND FROM FRESNO IN THIS FLIGHT OF FANCY ABOUT WHAT MIGHT. WHEN YOU SEE LA SHOWS UP -- BUT BUT I WANT TO HEAR YOUR RESPONSE TO THE OF THE ISSUE THAT -- DOCTOR WEBER I JUST REYES BUT I AM I HAVE TO SAY I'M A BIT CONFUSED NOW WHETHER. THE THE ISSUE IS THE MERIT INCREASE OR THE INVERSION OR WHETHER OR AND THAT'S THE INTER CONNECTED TO THE OF THE TWO BUT MAYBE ALL OF THIS IS WHY THIS IS A SUBJECT THAT'S FRANKLY I THINK BETTER. BETTER DEALT WITH OUTSIDE OF AREA. A HEARING LIKE THIS BUT WE'RE HERE I VOTED FOR THIS LAST TIME -- I'M NOT SURE WHERE I WANT TO GO BUT I DO WANT TO HEAR FROM BOTH SIDES. ON WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED BECAUSE WE HEARD THAT CSU -- ELIMINATED -- THIS BENEFIT OUTSIDE OF BARGAINING -- AND NOW EVERYBODY ELSE HAS IT. ON SO IF THAT'S ALL THE CASE THEN THE QUESTION IS IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THERE'S IF IFIT'S ACCURATE THERE'S AN AND JUSTICE THAT'S HAPPENING AND YOU'VE HAD A YEAR NOW. TO THINK ABOUT THIS ISSUE -- I THINK IT'S BEEN A YEAR SINCE WE HEARD IT LAST AND I WOULD JUST THINK YOU WOULD HAVE SPENT SOME TIME ON IT SO YOU COULD LIKE. A JOKE ADDRESS -- COLLECTIVELY ALL THOSE ISSUES ARE. I'D VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO -- WITH THE GREATEST OF RESPECT -- THERE WAS NOTHING WHICH WAS JUST TOLD TO THIS COMMITTEE WHICH JACKIE'S AYE THE STOCK HISTORICALLY ACCURATE OR IS CURRENTLY REFLECTS THE SITUATION IN THE C. ISSUE. I'VE MAIN BARGAINING THESE CONTRACTS SINCE TWO THOUSAND SIX I'VE BEEN THE CHIEF NEGOTIATOR OF MULTIPLE CYCLES OF BARGAINING. HISTORICALLY WHAT HAPPENED WAS THAT. IN THE MID NINETEEN NINETY IS. THE STATE DECIDED TO CHANGE THE WAY THAT FUNDS WERE APPROPRIATED TO THE CSU. PREVIOUSLY THE STATE PROVIDED MONEY. FOR ARTS STEPPING INCREASES AND THAT WAS PART OF THE C. ISSUES BUDGET. THE STATE MOVED AWAY AND GAVE US A BLOCK AMOUNTS OF MONEY AND SAID YOU CSU NOW DECIDE HOW YOU SPEND THAT MONEY. SO WE NEGOTIATED WITH ALL UNIONS TO MOVE AWAY FROM. WHAT GENERALLY COULD BE COLD STEP SYSTEM EVEN THOUGH IT WILL HE DIDN'T LOOK ANYTHING LIKE STATE CIVIL SERVICE? TOWARDS A SYSTEM OF OPEN RANGES. NOW. THERE WAS ONE UNION CSU A YOU. WHO DIDN'T NEGOTIATE? OPEN RANGES AND WE WENT THROUGH THE STATURE TREAT IMPASSE PROCEDURE UNDER HERE. AND UNDER HERE AT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS THE ABILITY TO IMPOSE ITS LAST OFFER. FOR THE LAST OFFER WITHIN REASONABLE CONTEMPLATION OF THE PARTS SO TO SAY THAT IT WAS DONE OUTSIDE OF COLLECTIVE BARGAINING IS TO COMPLETELY IGNORE HERO. AND THE TERMS WHICH UNDER WHICH WE OPERATE AS COLLECTIVE BARGAINING. SO SINCE THE AND ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THE HASN'T BEEN RANGE MOVEMENT WHICH IS WHAT THIS REALLY AMOUNTS. TO IS THE EVERY TIME WE HAVE GIVEN. SALARY INCREASES BY WAY OF GENERAL SALARY INCREASES. THE UNIONS HAVE PASSED. AND DEMANDED THAT THE MINIMUM AND A MAXIMUM OF THE RANGE IS INCREASED BY THE SAME PERCENTAGE OF THE G. SI. SO WE CAN PUT HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF WE HAVE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS IN TWENTY PLAY SALARIES. AND THE POSITIONING RANGE HASN'T NECESSARILY CHANGED BECAUSE THE MINIMUM AND A MAXIMUM THROUGH COLLECTIVE BARGAINING TO BE INCREASED BY THE SAME PERCENTAGE. HE WAS A A SEPARATE MECHANISM CALLED IN RANGE PROGRESSION TO DO INDIVIDUAL INCREASES. AND THAT'S SOMETHING WHICH THE CAMPUS IS DIRECTLY FUND. SO THE SECOND PART OF THIS IS EVERYBODY ELSE GETS MERIT SALARY INCREASES THAT'S NOT A TIME WHICH WE USE INCIDENT IN THE CSU. AS FAR AS YOU THE STAFF UNITS ARE CONCERNED THEY ALSO USE THE IN RANGE PROGRESSION MECHANISM IN ORDER TO DO EQUITY ADJUSTMENTS DEAL WITH LONGEVITY. AND DEAL WITH -- ISSUES AROUND INVASION AND COMPRESSION -- THE ONLY. SALARY INCREASE WHICH IS LINKED TO ME AND MERITS IS ACTUALLY FOR THE M. P. P.'S WHERE THERE IS A REQUIREMENT OF SATISFACTORY SERVICE TO GET ANY TYPE OF INCREASE A TOLL. IN A YEAR BUT FOR THE OTHER BARGAINING UNITS -- SALARIES ARE GIVEN SO SALARY INCREASES ARE GIVEN TO EVERYBODY WHO'S IN PAY STATUS AT THE DATE THAT THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT IS RATIFIED WAR RETROACTIVELY FAST NEGOTIATED AT THE TABLE. SO ALL OF THIS IS SUBJECT TO COLLECTIVE BARGAINING ALL OF THIS IS BEING DEALT WITH. MANY MANY TIMES OVER MULTIPLE DAYS OVER MULTIPLE YEARS. I'M NOT STILL REMAINS THE BEST AND ONLY MECHANISM TO MAKE ANY MEANINGFUL PROGRESS. IN RELATION TO THESE SERIOUS ISSUES WHICH WE ARE BOTH TRIED TO FACE -- UNION AND MANAGEMENT TO LIGHT. THE OTHER ISSUE IS OF SOME UNIONS HAVE NEGOTIATED A THERE'S A USUALLY A POOL OF MONEY THAT WE PUT INTO COMPENSATION. AND THE UNION. OF SOME UNIONS HAVE CHOSEN TO SPLIT THAT UP SO THAT LOWER PAID EMPLOYEES LECTURERS ARE A FACTOR OF FACULTY. CAN'T GET COMPETITION. THIS IS QUESTION ABOUT DISTRIBUTION WE KNOW TO GET WE WE BARGAINED ESSENTIALLY THE SIZE OF THE POOL IN DOLLAR TERMS OR IN PERCENTAGE TERMS. AND THEN HOW IT'S DISTRIBUTED AMONGST THE THE DIFFERENT EMPLOYEE GROUPS. SOME OF OUR UNIONS PARTICULARLY THE CFA THE FACULTY HAVE BEING. HAVE WILLING TO WORK WITH THOSE AND COME UP WITH DIFFERENTIAL DISTRIBUTION MECHANISMS. AS FAR AS I STAFF UNITS IN PARTICULAR THE CSU YOU. EVEN THOUGH WE'VE PRESENTED THEM WITH PROPOSALS WHICH WOULD ADDRESS EQUITY ISSUES WHICH WOULD AGGRESSIVE RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION ON EACH AND EVERY OCCASION THE UNION HAS DEMANDED THAT THE MONEY BE DISTRIBUTED BY WAY OF GENERAL SALARY INCREASE. SO WE DO BARGAIN THESE THINGS BUT ULTIMATELY IT'S BEEN THE UNION THAT DEMANDED THE EVERYBODY GETS THE SAME PERCENTAGE BECAUSE THAT'S POLITICALLY. WHAT THEY CAN GET RATIFIED SO TO HEAR THAT THE CSU IS NOT BEEN SEEKING TO DO THIS IS AN ABSOLUTE -- FAILURE TO RECOGNIZE WHAT WE HAVE DONE ON THE PROPOSALS WHICH WE HAVE MADE IN WHICH WE CONTINUE TO MAKE. BOTH OUTSIDE OF BARGAINING WHICH WILL MAKE IN THE NEXT BARGAINING CYCLE. I MAY I THINK HE DID HIGHLIGHTED A POINT WHICH IS HERE UP HERE A IS GEARED TOWARDS THE EMPLOYER IT PUTS US US THE EMPLOYEES AT A DISADVANTAGE BECAUSE WE ARE REQUIRED TO TAKE. THE LAST BEST AND FINAL AND IN THIS CASE IT UNILATERALLY WE SAY IT UNILATERALLY BECAUSE WE DID NOT AGREE TO IT WAS A LAST BEST AND FINAL WHEN WE WERE STUCK WITH THE STEPS REMOVED. FROM OUR MEMBERS NOW SINCE THEN THEY'VE NEGOTIATED VARIOUS OTHER FORMS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN ARE NOT TO THE SAME CALIBER AND THAT'S PROBLEMATIC IN PART WHEN THE SALARY STEPS ARE. INCREASING REFLECTING COLA BUT WE HAVE A MEMBER THAT'S WORK FOR FIFTY THREE YEARS IS ONLY HALFWAY THROUGH THE SALARY RANGE I DON'T KNOW IF WORKING MORE THAN HALF A CENTURY. SHOULDN'T YOU TOWARDS THE MAX RANGE BUT I THINK THAT'S HIGHLY PROBLEMATIC TO REFLECT ON ACTUALLY SIX SIX OF OUR SIXTEEN THOUSAND MEMBERS ARE IN THE HIGH END OF THE RANGE. THERE'S NO CONVERSATION THAT HAPPENS AT THE NEGOTIATING TABLE I ACTUALLY HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF MEETING YOU WHEN I WAS AN INTERN DURING NEGOTIATED AND HE IS VERY TOUGH. BUT HE WAS NOT NEGOTIATED ON THIS SO I JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT HERE UP WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT TRADITIONAL COLLECTIVE BARGAINING IT IS A LITTLE BIT OF A BIASED -- ARGUMENT THAT WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT CLICK THE BARGAINING WERE UNDER A DIFFERENT SYSTEM. I JUST WANT BY FINAL PARTS OF STEP TO THE CHAIR NOT MAKE MISTER CHAIR OF TWENTY SECOND. I'M GOING TO CONTINUE TO LOOK TOWARDS THE MEMBERS OF THE MEMBERS HAVE QUESTIONS YEAH I I DO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS IN THE COMMENT BUT IF I GO THIS IS HELPFUL FOR ME OKAY. QUESTION YEAH BUT IF YOU IF YOU WANNA RESPOND GO AHEAD CERTAINLY AND AND THIS THIS GOES. TO REMEMBER THIS -- POINTS ABOUT THE THE TYPES OF EMPLOYEES HERE IF YOU EXCLUDE MP PAYS THE MANAGERS AND THE FACULTY. I WAS JUST CHECKING WE'RE LOOKING AT A RANGE OF EMPLOYEES WHO AT A MINIMUM -- THE MINIMUM THE SALARY RANGE WILL BE TWO THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS PER MONTH. AND THEN THE MAXIMUM OF THE HIGHEST RANGE WILL BE TWENTY ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS PER MONTH. SO WE'RE NOT JUST LOOKING AT PEOPLE AT THE BOTTOM AND WE HAVE A LOT OF INDIVIDUALS PARTICULAR IN THE I. T. AND YOU KNOW THE BARKING UNITS HAVE BEEN PAID VERY GOOD SIX FIGURE SALARIES. AND THIS BILL WOULD GIVE THEM THE SAME AS THE GROUNDS KEEPERS IN THE CUSTODIANS IN THE FOOD SERVICE WORKERS. IT'S A BLUNT INSTRUMENT IT DOESN'T DEAL WITH THE PROBLEM IT JUST MAKES IT WORSE. IF THANK YOU MISTER TURN ALL OF YOUR CHANCE RESPOND BECAUSE THIS IS HELPFUL FOR ME AND I I I WILL CONFESS I'M -- I'M STRUGGLING A LOT WITH THIS I FIND MYSELF IN A VERY SIMILAR POSITION TO MISTER BLOOM -- AND AND AND TRYING TO SORT THROUGH SOME OF THIS I GUEST -- HAVE A A NUMBER OF COMMENTS FOR JUST A FEW QUESTIONS FOR THE AUTHORED WANTED -- TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING FOR THIS BILL AND FOR FOR ALL OF YOUR SERVICE AND MY MY GRANDFATHER WAS -- IN A PLAY THE CSU SYSTEM FOR SEVERAL DECADES AND SO JUST WANTED TO THANK THE IN PLACER HERE TODAY I KNOW YOU GUYS DO -- EXTRAORDINARY WORKING A LOT HE PUT YOUR HEART AND YOUR SOUL INTO SERVING OUR STUDENTS AND AND CREATING A BETTER FUTURE FOR OUR STATE SO I DID WANT. TO START WITH THAT -- I GUESS MY QUESTIONS ARE WHY -- AND I'M JUST -- LOOKING AT THE THE COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND MY THINKING ABOUT THE MANDATE THAT CSU MUCH USE EXISTING RESOURCES TO PAY FOR THE ON GOING 5% OF WHAT THE THINKING IS BEHIND THAT. SURE SO -- MR GABRIEL GREAT QUESTION -- WE SOLVE THIS FUND OF MONEY -- AS MUCH AS A MISSED MARTINEZ WANTS TO CLAIM THAT IT IS EARMARKED MONEY -- AND ACTUALLY THAT HAS TRANSITIONED OVER TIME TO LAST YEAR IT STARTED OUT HIS EARMARKED MONEY. AND ABOUT LESS THAN 45% IS THERE MARKED BASED ON USER FEES THEY STAY WITHIN THE FUND THE REQUIRED USE FOR THOSE PROGRAMS WE'LL SEE WHAT THE ART IT SAYS MAY ABOUT THE PARKING PROGRAM BUT THAT'S THE INTENT. IF YOU LOOK AT THE DOCUMENT SIGNED BY CHANCELLOR WHITE. YOU'LL SEE AN ENDING ITEM CALLED CSU OPERATIONS THAT IS COMPRISED MAINLY OF STUDENT TUITION. AS WELL AS SALARY SAVINGS THE STATE COMPTROLLER TELLS US I DON'T KNOW WHO INTRODUCED TALKING TO IN THE STATE COMPTROLLER THEY'RE TELLING US. THIS IS THE ONGOING DISCRETIONARY MONEY. ONGOING DISCRETIONARY MONEY SO WE SAW THAT WE SAID WELL. WE DON'T WANT TO PUT ANY PRESSURE FOR FEE INCREASES OR ANYTHING WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS MONEY. WHICH SHOULD HAVE BEEN USED FOR THIS PURPOSE IS USED FOR THIS PURPOSE AND THAT'S WHY WE PUT THE LANGUAGE IN ABOUT THE A USING USING THE EXISTING BUDGET. MISTER SCHWARTZ BRECK. THE SALARY WISE -- TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN THIS MAN WAS MAKING TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. FIVE YEARS LATER HE'S MAKING TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS YEAR I'VE GOT JANITORS THAT WOULD LOVE TO TAKE THAT INCREASE AS AN ANNUAL INCOME. AND THEN FINALLY JUST TO CLARIFY SOME HISTORY BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S REALLY BEEN MISREPRESENTED BY MR. CHORE BRICKS COMMENTS. NINETEEN NINETY TO LOBBY BE IN THE DOCUMENTS WE HAVE PILES OF THEM. NINETY NINETEEN DO YOU NINETEEN NINETY TO THE CSU SAID WE'RE NOT GOING TO PAY YOUR STEP THAT WAS IN THE CONTRACT. WE TOOK A THE PURPOSE AN APPELLATE COURT RULED FOUR YEARS LATER THAT THE CSU VIOLATED THE CONTRACT ORDER THE CSU TO COMPENSATE FOR THOUSAND EMPLOYEES AT THE TIME IT WAS ONE OF THE LARGEST PAY OUTS THAT PERMIT EVER. HAD EVER DEALT WITH. WHAT DID SEE IF YOU DO THAT YEAR? NINETEEN NINETY SIX THEY KNEW THAT THERE WAS A COURT CASE COMING OUT IN MARCH OF NINETEEN NINETY SIX THE UNILATERALLY IMPOSED AND TOOK OUT STEPS. SO WHEN THE COURT. CAME OUT WITH THIS DECISION IN DECEMBER OF NINETEEN NINETY SIX WE COULDN'T APPLY IT TO THE ACTION. OF REMOVING STEP BECAUSE IT ONLY APPLIED TO THE PRIOR ACTION OF NOT PAYING FOR STEPS. AND COMPENSATING OUR EMPLOYEES THROUGH. NINETEEN NINETY SIX SO THEY'VE BEEN PLAYING GAMES WITH THIS. WITH THESE EMPLOYEES -- I DON'T KNOW ANY STATE AGENCY THAT HAS A MULTI BILLION DOLLAR FUND. AGAIN THEY START OUT BY SAYING IF YOU'RE MARKED LESS THAN HALF OF THAT MONEY THEN THEY SAID IT WAS ONE TIME MONEY MR GABRIEL. SO WE WENT TO THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES WITH THIS DOCUMENT. AND SAID LET'S TALK TO THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES WE PRESENTED TO THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES CHANCELLOR WHITE ON FILM IS SHAKING HIS HEAD LIKE THIS. BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL LOOKING AT HIM GOING DO WE HAVE A SLUSH FUND HE'S. SO THEY COME BACK AND TELL ME I SAID WELL THAT'S RIDICULOUS WE HAVE A DOCTOR WITH HIS SIGNATURE ON IT LET'S MAIL THIS TO THE BOARD OF TRUSTEE MEMBERS. SO WE DID. FOUR DAYS LATER MR GABRIEL FOUR DAYS LATER. CHANCE FOR WHITE COMES OUT IN THE PRESENCE AS WE ARE NOT GOING TO PURSUE A STUDENT TUITION INCREASE THIS YEAR. WHY BECAUSE WE HAVE A MULTI BILLION DOLLAR SURPLUS? HE'S NOT GOING TO SEE THAT THAT'S ONE TIME ON YOUR YOUR MARK MONEY THAT IS MONEY AS DISCRETIONARY ONGOING FIND AT THE STATE COMPTROLLER HAS THAT EXIST. THE MONEY TO PAY FOR STEP FOR ONE YEAR. 4% OF THAT FUND. OF THE DISCRETIONARY MONEY. SO WE THINK WHAT THEY WERE DOING RIGHT NOW IS IS IS CLEARLY IN AND JUSTICE. TO THESE EMPLOYEES. TO THE POINT OF THE STRING PEAS I KNOW I'M SORRY FOR SPEAKING OUT OF TURN I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THAT WAS STATUTORILY GIVEN TO US THAT AUTHORITY WAS STATUTORILY GIVEN TO US TO COLLECTORS FEES. TYPICALLY WE DO IS WE SPENT. THE OF THESE GENERAL FUND DOLLARS FIRST NAME KEEPS FROM THE STUDENT FEES SECOND. I WANT TO POINT OUT TO YOU IN THE DEPTHS OF THE DEEPEST DARKEST HOURS OF THE LOWER THE BUDGET NOT THAT LONG AGO ABOUT FOUR FIVE YEARS AGO. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ASKED US THE ASKED US TO LEND THEM MONEY TO KEEP THE STATE A FLOAT SO THIS IS NOT TOP SECRET MONEY THIS IS MONEY THAT THE LEGISLATURE AND GET THE GOVERNOR AND FINANCE ARE AWARE OF SO I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT YOUR STAMINA. AND IF I MASON ARE REALISTIC COUNTIES CLEARANCE TRANSPARENT AS WELL AS THE THIS THE REASONS WHY IT'S KEPT IN THE SOURCES OF MONEY FROM WHERE IT COMES IN THE REASONS WHY WE NEED THOSE MONIES IN VISITS. THANK YOU FOR THAT NIGHT JUST ONE OTHER QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR WHICH IS -- JUST AT THE ABOUT THE 5% NUMBER HOW YOU ARRIVED AT THAT. THAT'S BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THE NORMAL STEP WAS I MEAN THERE WAS A 5% STEP INCREASE BETWEEN THE VARIOUS LEVELS OF EMPLOYMENT IF YOU CAME IN A CERTAIN LEVEL THE NEXT STEP WAS 5% 5% DEPENDING UPON YOUR EVALUATIONS NOT DONE EVERY YEAR. AND DEPENDING UPON WHAT THE MONIES AVAILABLE AND ALSO WITH THE NOT TO GET A RECOMMENDATION. SO IT'S NOT AN AUTOMATIC THING THAT HAPPENS IS ONE OF THE FEW THINGS THAT REALLY IS AMERICA JUST WENT WITH IT HAS TO BE ASSESSMENT AND EVALUATION OF THE INDIVIDUAL. BUT THAT WAS STANDARD AT THE UNIVERSITY AND STILL IS YEAH. YOU HAVE TO THE JUST TO SAY MISTER GABER WE WOULD LOVE TO NEGOTIATE THIS VAST FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS TO PUT THIS ON THE TABLE. I'VE GOT A QUOTE I'M HAPPY TO REVIEW THAT WAS FROM NOTES FROM ONE OF THE SESSIONS -- THE BASICALLY SAID YOUR EMPLOYEES CAN ROT IN HELL BEFORE WE DO STEPS AGAIN. THAT'S NOT RESPECTFUL AT ALL -- IN. IN THOSE NEGOTIATIONS -- WE WOULD LOVE TO SIT AND TALK ABOUT IT UNFORTUNATELY WE CAN'T DO IT UNTIL WERE MADE WHOLE AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE ASKING 45% WERE SAYING LISTEN YOU YOU'VE ACCRUED ALL THIS MONEY FOR ALL THIS TIME IT. OKAY BUT FROM THIS POINT ON WE WANT TO BE MADE WHOLE. GET US TO WHERE WE WERE AND THEY WERE HAPPY TO SIT DOWN AND DO NEGOTIATIONS COLLECTIVE BARGAIN THE WAY IT WAS INTENDED TO BE. THIS WAS NOT DONE THROUGH COLLECTIVE BARGAINING IT WAS SUBVERTED. AND WE WERE IN THIS POSITION THAT WE WOULD NOT BE COMING TO YOU IF THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT WE HAD NEGOTIATED OR JUST MADE A BAD DECISION. MR SANTIAGO START TONIGHT I MISSED MR CHECK I MAKE A FEW COMMENTS IS THAT OKAY. WITH YOUR WITH YOUR PERMISSION I'LL BE VERY BRIEF -- SO SIR THANK YOU FOR THAT I I AM A THAT THE REASON I'M STRUGGLING THIS IS I'M. HAVE A A PRINCIPLE OUT THERE THAT I THINK -- YOU THINK THE THE THE AUTHORS ACKNOWLEDGED WHICH IS THAT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THINGS THAT OUGHT TO BE PART OF THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING PROCESS ARE PART OF THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING PROCESS I THINK IT'S REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT WE DON'T CREATE A PRECEDENT. THAT WOULD FOLKS DON'T GET WHAT THEY WANT IN THE PROCESS EITHER ON EITHER SIDE THAT THEY COME TO LEGISLATURE BECAUSE WE ARE NOT SUITED TO REFEREE THOSE DISCUSSIONS. THOSE ARE BEST LEFT TO THE BARGAINING UNITS TO THE UNIVERSITY TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS AND I I'M GLAD TO HEAR YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT DOCTOR EVER I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT. HAVE YOU THAT I SURE I THINK I HEARD MY COLLEAGUE FROM SANTA MONICA SAY THAT AS WELL SO I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT POINT. THE FLIP SIDE OF THAT IS IT SEEMS TO ME FROM WHAT I CAN GATHER HERE THERE DOESN'T EVEN SEEM TO BE. A BASIC AGREEMENT ON THE FACTS BUT FROM WHAT I GATHER THERE'S A REAL AND SIGNIFICANT INJUSTICE YEAR IT SEEMS TOUGH PERSISTED FOR TWO DECADES IT SEEMS THAT THERE'S A GROUP OF EMPLOYEES THAT ARE BEING TREATED. DIFFERENTLY FROM ANY OTHER CLASS OF EMPLOYEES ACROSS THE UNIVERSITY AND REALLY IT'S BEEN REPRESENTED TO ME ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND SO -- AND AND EVERYTHING THE DOCTOR WEBER SAID ABOUT THIS BEING TAKEN AWAY FROM FOLKS OUTSIDE OF THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING PROCESS -- IS VERY CONCERNING TO ME SO WHAT I'M STRUGGLING WITH IS THIS GENERAL PRINCIPLE THAT I HAVE THAT'S A VERY IMPORTANT ONE TO ME -- AND ALSO THIS DISCRETE SET OF FACTS WHICH ALSO APPEARS TO BE VERY VERY TROUBLING TO ME -- SO WANTED TO TO TO THANK DR WEBER FRONT FOR FOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL I WANT TO THANK THE THE FOLKS ARE COMING UP IN TESTIFYING ABOUT IT FOR BRING IT TO OUR ATTENTION. I WILL SAY TO THE THE FOLKS IN THE CSU I CONSIDER MYSELF ONE OF THE FOREMOST PROPONENTS OF HIGHER EDUCATION THE STATE I THINK THAT WE ARE DRAMATICALLY UNDER FUNDING HIGHER EDUCATION. I WANT TO DO EVERYTHING I CAN TO INCREASE FUNDING FOR HER EDUCATION BUT ALSO SEEMS TO ME THAT YOU ARE MISS PERCEIVING WHERE THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR ARE ARE A PRIOR GOVERNOR ON THIS ISSUE I WENT BACK AND READ. GOVERNOR BROWN TO VETO MESSAGE ON A PRIOR VERSION OF THIS BILL YOU SAW THE OVERWHELMING VOTE FOR THIS A PRIVATIZATION IN THIS LEGISLATURE SO CLEARLY FOLKS ARE -- UPSET ABOUT THE CURRENT STATUS CIRCUMSTANCES -- THE AND AND AND I WOULD YOU KNOW ENCOURAGE YOU TO GO BACK AND READ THAT LANGUAGE AND UNDERSTAND WHERE FOLKS ARE IN THE LATEST TRYING THIS MEAN CLEARLY IT'S A BIPARTISAN ISSUE THAT FOLKS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT HOW YOUR COMPENSATING THESE EMPLOYEES. AND I WOULD REALLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO THINK ABOUT THAT TRYING TO GO SHEET THAT ISSUE BECAUSE THAT'S HOW IT NEEDSTO BE DONE WHEN THERE'S A REFUSAL TO NEGOTIATE WE END UP IN THESE. THESE TYPE OF SITUATIONS SO THOSE ARE MY COMMENTS AND APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY SHARE THEM THANK YOU MISTER SANTIAGO. YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MISTER CHAIR THIS IS ONE OF THOSE BILLS WERE THAT YOU WISH A ONE AWAY BECAUSE THERE'S NO NEED FOR IT BECAUSE IT WAS ALL TAKEN CARE OF THE CONTRACT. NEGOTIATION TABLES AND I WAS MENTIONING THE AUTHOR EARLIER YOU KNOW. THAT THAT THAT YOU KNOW I I KIND OF FEEL CONFLICTED COMPLETED IN THE SENSE THAT. DOING CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS HERE IT IS IS A BIT OF A CHALLENGE HOWEVER HOWEVER WHEN CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS BREAKS DOWN THIS IS THE POINT WHERE WE TRY TO ENCOURAGE AND PUSH IT. THE END WE HOPE THAT SOMETHING FAIR WOULD COME I DON'T THINK IT'S A IT'S A GOOD PRESENCE BECAUSE YOU CAN GIVE A THING YOU CAN TAKE IT. AND THAT THAT IS ALSO A CHALLENGING SITUATION I'M TO GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING. OF WHAT ACTUALLY IS THE ISSUE NOW AND AND I SAY THAT BECAUSE I HAVEN'T BEEN ON A COMMUNITY COLLEGE FOR THE PAST WE WENT THROUGH SOME OF THE SIMILAR CONVERSATIONS RIGHT WHERE YOU HAVE AN EMPLOYEE WHO HAS BEEN THERE TWENTY FIVE YEARS -- BECAUSE RACES WERE HELD BACK OR OR NOT HAPPENING IN A CERTAIN PERIOD IN TIME INSURGENTS MAY BE A LITTLE BIT A LITTLE BIT LONGER THAN THEN YOU'D WHICH FOR BUT YOU GIVE ME FULLER DATA. GO BACK AND FORTH THAT I APPRECIATE THAT BUT SO YOU MAY HAVE EMPLOYEES BUT TWENTY FIVE YEARS TEN YEARS -- WAGED AN INCREASE FOR A CERTAIN PERIOD OF TIME -- DOING MARKET THE OR SALARY SURVEYS APPOINT TIME WAIT JUST COME UP ON THE USUALLY MADE OF WITH SOME COMPARABLE SORT OF WORK FORCE AND EXPERIENCE AND AND TIME RIGHT. AND SO YOU GET EMPLOYEES TO COME IN AND MAKE A HIGHER WAGE -- IN MY MY QUESTION IS ASSEMBLY IN TIME. WHAT PREVENTS IT WHAT WHAT'S PREVENTING YOUR SIDE FROM ACTUALLY GETTING TO ACE A STELLAR THE SALARY STEP -- A PROPOSAL THAT ADDRESSES SOME OF THOSE ISSUES COULD. THAT DOES BECOME A PROBLEM NOW VERY DIFFERENT THIS YES YOU COULD DON'T HAVE A CSU NEXT DOOR THAT COMPETES TO YOU. UP IT'S PROBABLY THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES PREVALENT THAN A AND ANY PUBLIC AGENCY WILL BE LAW ENFORCEMENT OR WHAT HAVE YOU BUT THIS SEEMS TO BE A AN OVERWHELMING PROBLEM. AND CURES LIKE WHAT IS REALLY AT THE CRUX OF THE U. PREVENTING FROM DOING SOMETHING LIKE THAT. SATCHER I'LL TRY AND BE SIMPLE -- THIS IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS WHICH YOU CAN ONLY MAKE SO SIMPLE. BUT ESSENTIALLY IT'S LIKE TRYING TO BOLT ON A PIECE FROM THE FORD ON TWO CHEVY AND EXPECTING IT TO WORK. WE HAVE AN OPEN RANGE SYSTEM. WE WOULD HAVE TO COMPLETELY RE ENGINEER ALL THE CLASSIFICATIONS AND THEN PLACE EVERY SINGLE EMPLOYEE. IN A NEWS AGNEW RANGE FOR THAT CLASSIFICATION TO GET SOMETHING SIMILAR. TO WHAT HAPPENS IN STATE CIVIL SERVICE. THEY HAVE SOME VERY NARROW RANGES WE HAVE RANGES WHICH GO I DIDN'T 50% OF THE MINIMUM. EMPLOYEES OBVIOUSLY WOULD WANT NOT TO BE. PUT DOWN TO BE PLACED ON A STEP THEY DON'T WANT TO PLACE THE FASTEST THE NATURAL RESPONSE. THE INITIAL COST TO DOING THAT WOULD BE EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE. THIS ISSUE IS IS RANGE MOVEMENT AND AND NO AND I UNDERSTAND YOU WOULD IF YOU HIRED SOMEBODY LET'S SAY TEN BUT I'M GONNA USE NUMBERS THAT DON'T REALLY EXIST RIGHT BUT AT TEN BUCKS A YEAR. THAT ARE COMING IN AND PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN WORKING THERE FOR THIRTY YEARS AT AT TWO BOOKS YEARS CERTAINLY WOULD EXPECT THOSE AT TEN YEAR AND INSTEAD OF SAYING AT TEN YEARS. WHEN YOU DO A SATELLITE I'D RESURFACE A SUPPLE THE SAUDIS GO YOU WOULD EXPECT THE NEW HIRES TO COME BACK DOWN THEY HAVE TO STAY WHERE THEY'RE AT? BUT BUT I THINK THERE IS A THERE IS A WAY TO CONTACT NEGOTIATIONS TO BEGIN. THAT PROCESS WHEN WE DID IT WE CALL THE BUDGET ALLOCATION MODEL AND IT WAS GIVEN OVER A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF YEARS WHERE WE ALIGNED -- A PRESIDENT TO A CAMPUS TO A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF DEAN'S TO POPULATION AND START STANDARDIZING THAT FORMAT ALONG THE ROAD WHEN WE WERE DOING THAT WE WERE ALSO TAKE A LOOK AT SALARY SURVEYS -- WITHIN THE REGION TO TAKE TO TO ACCOUNT NO YOU CAN'T DO THIS OVERNIGHT I GET THAT AND AND EVEN IF WE WANTED TO TAKE CARE OF ALL THOSE THINGS THAT THE CONTRACT NEGOTIATION TABLE. IT WOULD ALMOST BE IMPOSSIBLE TO TAKE CARE OF THAT ONE PARTICULAR ISSUE AT ONE TIME. BUT BUT THERE CAN BE EVEN IF EVEN IF YOU WERE TO SAY LOOK WE CAN'T DO IT NOW. IS THERE STEPS OVER A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF YEARS THEY GET YOU TO A POINT SO YOU'RE NOT FACING THIS THIRTY YEARS TONIGHT I FACE IN THIS TEN YEARS FROM NOW. THAT WOULD BE A REASONABLE STEP FORWARD IN THIS CONVERSATION TO AT LEAST THE LINE -- THOSE SALARIES -- WITH EXPERIENCE -- EXPERIENCE -- THAT WOULD MATCH UP TO A NEW SALARY SCALE. SIR I AM PLEASED TO TELL YOU THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS. HAVE MANY OF OUR CAMPUSES CAMPUS PRESIDENTS OF ALLOCATED SPECIFIC POTS OF MONEY. IN ORDER TO DO ACROSS THE BOARD CAMPUS EQUITY PROGRAMS SOME OF THOSE HAVE BEEN TAKING PEOPLE UP TO COURT HOUSE BASED ON LONGEVITY OF SERVICE. OTHERS OF LOOKED ACROSS TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S NO INVASION COMPRESSION. CAMPUSES OF SPEND VERY VERY HEAVILY TO DO THIS FROM CAMPUS FUNDS TO TO TRYING TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES -- WILL WE HAVE BEEN TRYING IN COLLECTIVE BARGAINING TO USE THE IN RANGE PROGRESSION. ALSO TO MEET THOSE SAME. GOALS AND OBJECTIVES AND OVER THE LAST THREE TO FOUR YEARS WE'VE SAME AND BOTH THE NUMBER AND AMOUNTS OF THOSE IN RANGE PROGRESSIONS SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASE IT IS THAT WE HAVE BEEN ADDRESSING IT. MISTER CHAIR. IS THERE AN ESTIMATED TIME IN YOUR IN YOUR WORLD YOUR POINT OF VIEW IS AN ESTIMATED TIME WHERE THIS WOULD BE ADDRESSED RIGHT BE TEN YEARS LIKE WHAT WE DID IT WE KNEW THAT THERE WAS THREE PHASE. THREE PHASES WHAT HAPPENED OVER FIVE YEARS IN IN IF NOT THAT WOULD BE GIVEN AN EXTRA YEAR TO WRITE. SO IT IF IT THE I ASSUME YOU WANT TO DO IT AT THE CSU LEVEL NOT AFFECT NOT AT THE CAMPUS LEVEL BUT IT BUT HAVING SAID THAT -- WHAT RANGY YEARS? IN YOUR WORLD VIEW DO YOU THINK THAT THOSE. THAT THAT THOSE EQUITY ISSUES WOULD BE BECOME ADDRESSED AND THEN I WANT TO ASK YOU THE OTHER SIDE TOO BUT I'M CURIOUS AS TO WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT THAT. IF SIR I MENTIONED WE'VE HAD WE'VE GOT A MEETING OF A THE UNION AND ADMINISTRATION TO TALK ABOUT SALARY STRUCTURE. THE PROPOSAL IS OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT YEAR WE'LL COME UP WITH SOME JOINT RECOMMENDATIONS AND TAKE THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS INTO BARGAINING. SO THE IDEA THAT WE'RE NOT. ONLY WILLING TO TALK ABOUT THIS IN COLLECTIVE BARGAINING BUT ALSO THE FACT THAT WE'RE TALKING THIS OFF CYCLE BECAUSE WE RECOGNIZE THIS IS A NOW ISSUE. RATHER THAN PUTTING OFF I THINK YOU SHOULD GIVE THIS COMMITTEE SOME REASSURANCE OF THE SEA ISSUE IS TRYING TO ADDRESS THIS. IT WILL TAKE MULTIPLE YEARS. IF THE OBJECTIVE IS TO GET EVERYBODY EQUAL OR DIFFERENTIAL BUT AS YOU POINTED OUT WE WE ARE DRIVEN BY MARKET FORCES. WHEN WE HIRE PEOPLE SAN DIEGO SAN JOSE SAN FRANCISCO IN A BOOMING ECONOMY WE HAVE TO PAY MARKET SALARIES? AND THEN WHAT WE ENCOURAGE ALL OUR CAMPUSES TO DO ALL THEIR HATE SHODDY POINT MINUTES IS LOOK AT THE SORRY OF THAT NEW HIRE LOOK AT THE CLASSIFICATION. AND USE THE IN RANGE PROGRESSION MECHANISM TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE NO IT. OR THE INEQUITIES A MITIGATED OR READY KATE. SO ALL OF THESE. PROCESSES IN RANGE PROGRESSION CAMPUS EQUITY PROGRAMS I WILL BE AN EMPLOYEE NOW. TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES. IN THE FUTURE OF A NIGHT. WRAP IT UP YES. BUT IT ON ON BEING ON YOUR SIDE OF AT ONE POINT IN TIME WE ALSO KNEW THAT OVER A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF YEARS. BY DEFAULT THE AGE AND LONGEVITY THROUGH THE DISTRICT THERE'D BE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF PEOPLE THAT WOULD NO LONGER BE THERE BY THE TIME WE GOT THE LAST PHASE SO WE ALWAYS KNEW THAT THERE BE A CERTAIN SAVINGS A DOLLARS. IF WE PUT A SALARY. A SKILL TOGETHER BECAUSE THE BY THE TIME WE GOT THERE ARE SOME OF THOSE PEOPLE WOULD NEVER MAKE IT TO TO A CERTAIN SCALE. BUT BECAUSE RETIREMENT ISSUES. SO SO THOSE NUMBERS AREN'T REALLY APPLE THE APPLE NUMBERS RIGHT BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY THERE'S SOME POPULATION THAT YOU KNOW OVER. TIME IS GONNA MAKE IT TO THE HOW TO THE HEIGHTS OURS SCALE ANYHOW. THE END ON TALK ABOUT THOSE EMPLOYEES HAVE BEEN THERE FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME. NO ONE ASKED IF I WANT ONE MORE QUESTION I KNOW ONE DUDE. THE OTHER SIDE. WHY ARE THEY NOT SEEING THE SAME WHAT WOULD THEY DO NOT SEE THE SAME THING? HI I AGREE WITH SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE HERE THAT THIS IS NOT THE BEST PLACE FOR NEGOTIATION. AND THIS IS SHOULDN'T BE NEGOTIATION -- SO. FOR THE LIMIT OF FOR FOR THE FOR TIMES SAY. BECAUSE I THINK WE COULD SIT HERE AND AND BE HERE ALL NIGHT DISCUSSING THESE THINGS. I I THINK THERE'S BEEN VERY GOOD DISCUSSION POINTS WELL TAKEN FROM BOTH SIDES OF POINTS TO BE NOTED BY BOTH SIDES. AND AND I WOULD IF PERMISSION WITH THE COMMITTEE -- FOR FOR TIME'S SAKE WE STILL HAVE A BELIEVE TEN MORE BILLS TO HEAR -- I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT SO I APOLOGIZE MISTER JONES GOING TO ASK. I WAS GONNA ASK THE PROPONENTS OF THE BILL IS HERE'S A QUESTION SO I APOLOGIZE AGAIN. SO WHAT WITH THAT IF IF THE COMMITTEE PERMITS I'M GOING TO ASK THE AUTHOR TO CLUBS THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- LET ME GO BACK TO WHERE WE STARTED. IS WHERE WE WANT IT WHERE THEY WERE GOING TO GO THERE A LOT OF ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED THAT ARE NOT WITHIN THE PURVIEW OF THIS BILL FIRST OF ALL. I MEAN THE WHOLE ISSUE OF TRYING TO RE DESIGN THE ENTIRE SYSTEM TO DEAL WITH IT. EQUITY IN SALARIES AND PEOPLE BEING HIRED AND ADMINISTRATORS AND ALL THIS KIND OF THING THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT WE KNOW THAT -- THIS BILL IS ABOUT EIGHT EIGHT A GROUP OF OF EMPLOYEES AT THE CSU SYSTEM. WHO HAD A A 5% OF STEP PROGRAM TAKEN AWAY NOT BECAUSE THEY BARGAINED FOR BUT WAS TAKEN AWAY? AND NOW THE QUESTION BECOMES DO WE GO BACK AND BARGAIN TO GET IT BACK WHEN IT WAS GIVEN TO BEEN WAS THERE'S IN THE FIRST PLACE. IT IS NICE TO HEAR ALL OF THE CONVERSATION ABOUT EVERYBODY AROUND BUT THIS IS REALLY ABOUT A SPECIFIC GROUP OF PEOPLE. WHO WANT TO TALK ABOUT HAVING A MERIT SALARY SYSTEM PLACE BACK IN THE OTHER SYSTEMS OTHER EMPLOYEES HAVE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND OTHER EMPLOYEES HAVE A TO SEE ISSUE SYSTEM? THAT WAS IN PLACE AND BOB EVEN WITH THE COMMENTS MADE BY THE GOVERNOR LAST YEAR THERE'S BEEN NO EFFORT TO GO BACK AND HAVE THIS CONVERSATION. AND THE GOVERNOR WAS HESITANT BECAUSE HE SAID THIS SHOULD BE DONE WITHIN COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AND MOST OF US FEEL THAT WAY. BUT THEY HAVE TRIED AND TRIED AND TRIED AND SO WHEN THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING SYSTEM DOESN'T COME BACK TO NEGOTIATE THIS WHAT DO YOU DO YOU JUST SAY WHATEVER AT SOME OF THE PEOPLE HAVE SAID IT RETIRED AND MOVED ON AND JUST SAY THE SYSTEM. IS NOT GONNA WORK FOR ME OR DO YOU BASICALLY COME TO THE FOLKS WHO ARE SUPPOSEDLY IN CHARGE OF THE SYSTEM WHICH IS THAT THE LEGISLATURE AND SAY. LOOK THIS WAS TAKEN AWAY WE TRIED OUR BEST EVERYONE HERE PROBABLY REALIZES THAT MOST EMPLOYEE ORGANIZATIONS IS SPECIAL INSTEAD OF CALIFORNIA HAVE A MERIT. SYSTEM BUILT INTO IT SO THAT YOU CAN DO ASSESSMENT IN YOU CAN EVALUATE PEOPLE AND THEY CAN GET MARRIED JUST ONCE WE DO THAT ALL THE TIME UP YOUR WITH OUR EMPLOYEES. THAT DOESN'T EXIST IN THE C. ISSUE FOR THIS PARTICULAR GROUP NOT FOR THE OTHERS BUT FOR THIS PARTICULAR GROUP WHICH IS THE LOWEST PAID LOWEST WAGE INDIVIDUALS IN THE SYSTEM. SO WHAT I'M ASKING IS THAT WE BASICALLY RESTORE THAT STRUCTURE BACK TO THEM NOW THE ISSUES OF ALL THE VERY SALARIES AND HOW YOU'RE GOING TO EQUITY IN HIGH GOING TO HAVE A SYSTEM AND YOU WILL TAKE FIVE YEARS TO BAG WITH THIS THIS THIS THIS. THAT IS NOT WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT I WANT TO MAKE THAT VERY VERY CLEAR WE UNDERSTOOD IT LAST YEAR WE BASICALLY RECOGNIZE THIS WAS A GOOD THING ON BOTH SIDES OF THE HOUSE. GUIDED TO THE GOVERNOR AND HE WROTE A STATEMENT -- BECAUSE HE WAS IN FAVOR BUT WROTE A STATEMENT BECAUSE HE FELT DIFFICULT MOVING INTO THAT THAT SYSTEM HOPING THAT THEY WOULD BE A FURTHER ALONG IN A CONVERSATION RIGHT NOW ABOUT HOW YOU RESTORE THE STEP INCREASES. OF THIS MERIT STEP THIS THERE THAT HAS NOT HAPPENED AND IT MAY NOT HAPPEN AND PROBABLY WON'T AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS. ISSUE WAS BROUGHT THEIR TOUGHEST NEGOTIATOR HERE BUT I WOULD REMIND HIM HE ENTERED THE SYSTEM IN. TWO THOUSAND SIX THIS HAPPENED IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX SO WHATEVER YOU THINK ABOUT OF THE HISTORY THAT HE READ ABOUT I OF THE SYSTEM IN. NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO SO I KNOW WHAT THEY DID. ALL THE EMPLOYEES AT ONE PARTICULAR TIME AND I'LL HARD IT WAS TO FIGHT TO GET BACK THE DIGNITY OF STOP MERIT STEP INCREASES OKAY AND AND EVERYONE HAS BEEN ABLE TO TAKE SOME OUT OF THE FIGURE IT OUT TO GET IT. BUT THEY HAVE BEEN RESISTANT TO GIVING IT TO OUR LOWEST PAID EMPLOYEES WILL OFTEN OUR MOST DEDICATED AND MORE COMMITTED INDIVIDUALS WHO MAKE THE SYSTEM WORK. SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK BUT I BOTH AB [inaudible] THREE SIX NINE OUR MOTION SECOND [inaudible] STORY -- I REMEMBER VERY WELL LAST YEAR AS WELL. RUSSIAN AND WE HAD A SUPPORT TO DO YOUR H HI I AGREE WITH THE AUTHOR. IT IS -- UNFAIR THAT HAVE -- EMPLOYEES WHO ARE NOT BENEFITING FROM THE SAME. KIND OF SALARIES STATUS LIVE UNDER. SO I SUPPORT THE BILL I ALSO AGREE -- ONE OF THE POINTS THAT MR GABRIEL MADE. THAT PERHAPS THE OTHER THINK ABOUT REMOVING THAT ONE OF THE PART IN THE BILL THAT IT MUST BE FROM. EXISTING.

FOLLOWED BY ASSISTANCE WITH CAL FRESH HELP WITH STAFF THE APPLICATION MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT AND REFERRALS TO FOR SUPPORT OF SERVICES OFF CAMPUS. MORE STUDENTS TO BE ABLE TO BE ASSISTED BY THIS MEASURE AND WE KNOW THERE'S A GREAT NEED FOR LEGISLATION THAT WOULD POSITIVELY IMPACT THE STUDENT COMMUNITY. AS WE'VE HEARD NEARLY ONE IN FIVE COMMITTEE CAUTIONS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS AT SOME POINT THE PAST YEAR AND IN DESPERATE NEED OF GREATER SUPPORT FOR HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS. HOMELESSNESS IS CYCLICAL AND SYSTEMIC SOLUTIONS REQUIRE PREVENTION INTERVENTION AND AFTER CARE IN ORDER TO BE SUCCESSFUL.

SIX YEARS HERE AS A MEMBER AND CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE I SEE THE NEED SO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL. FOR IT'S A MATTER SURGERY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION IS DUE PASSED TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. MEDINA AYE MEDINA AYE CHOI. CHOICE I JONES SAWYER HI JONES SAWYER I'D BLOOM. BLOOM I GABRIEL -- WHEN I KILEY? LEVINE LEVINE I LOW HIGH LOW AYE PATTERSON SANTIAGO WEBER. WEBER II. EIGHT ZERO THAT BILL IS OUT WE WILL LEAVE IT OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS AND OUR MOVING TO ITEM. EIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH RESEARCH AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS ALSO ENJOYS SAID DO PASS RECOMMENDATION ON BOTH SIDES OF THIS BILL WOULD ASSIST. WITH THE TRANSFER OF SICK LEAVE AND WITH AN IMPORTANT ASPECT TO CONTINUE TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE. EDUCATORS WHO CAN TRANSFER BETWEEN DISTRICTS AND A SEVEN AS A FOR A FACULTY MEMBER I THINK THIS IS. A BE BENEFICIAL TO THE STATE AND WITH ME HAVE OTHER WITNESSES TO TESTIFY VERY BRIEFLY IN SUPPORT. LEFT GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEDINA AND REST OF THE COMMITTEE -- YEAH YES THE INFORMATION I SAW THAT YOU ALREADY HAVE REALLY EXPLAINS THE ISSUES QUITE CLEARLY SO I DON'T NEED TO EXPLAIN THEM ANY FURTHER BUT I'LL JUST RELAY A LITTLE BIT OF MY OWN EXPERIENCE -- THE RIDLEY BILL IT'S EXPLAINED -- IN YOUR INFORMATION -- WAS TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FOURTEEN BUT I CAME OUT OF MY LOCAL FERTILITY ANSWER EXPERIENCE WE HAD TROUBLE WITH THE ADMINISTRATION ACCEPTING SICKLY FROM A PART TIME FACULTY MEMBER. WHO WAS CONSIDERING RETIREMENT BUT WAS ALSO HOPING TO TRANSFER HER SICK LEAVE SO? THE PROBLEM IS BACK THEN IT WAS ONE YEAR. OF AND THAT WAS BASED ON K. TWELVE WHERE BUT MOST K. TWELVE DOT JOBS ARE FULL TIME AND YOU CAN ONLY GO FROM ONE JOB TO ANOTHER IN ITS NATURAL THING TO TRANSFER YOUR SICK LEAVE. WHEN YOU DO THAT BUT FOR A PART TIME FACULTY AS YOU CAN READ -- THAT'S NOT THE CASE THEY NEVER QUITE KNOW WHEN THEY'RE DONE WITH ONE EMPLOYER AND ARE STARTING WITH ANOTHER. SO WE DID GET THAT BILL PASSED WE GOT A THREE YEAR WE'RE HOPING FOR A FIVE YEAR BUT A THREE YEAR PERIOD. THINK WE ONE OF THE FIVE BECAUSE WE THOUGHT THAN ANY REEMPLOYMENT RIGHTS THEY MIGHT HAVE A PART TIME FACULTY MEMBER THOSE WOULD HAVE EXPIRED AND THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN OKAY. BUT THE REALITY IS THAT PEOPLE DON'T THINK ABOUT THIS ISSUE UNTIL THEY GET TO RETIREMENT. AND A LOT OF TIME MAY HAVE PASSED BETWEEN ASSIGNMENTS AND OTHER DISTRICTS. IT'S DIFFICULT EVEN FOR FULL TIMERS BUT IT'S JUST. IMPOSSIBLE FOR PART TIMERS TO KNOW THAT THEY SHOULD TRANSFER THEIR SICK LEAVE. SO ONE OF THE ARGUMENTS BACK THEN WHEN WE WERE DOING THAT OTHER BILL WAS THE DISTRICTS SAID -- WE DON'T KEEP THOSE RECORDS WELL THEY DO KEEP THOSE RECORDS AND I'VE JUST RETIRED A LITTLE OVER A YEAR AGO. I GOT INFORMATION BACK FROM LAUSD WHERE I STARTED AT CRENSHAW HIGH SCHOOL TAUGHT FOR FOUR YEARS. NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR TO EIGHTY EIGHT THEY HAD TO GO TO MICRO FISH. BUT THEY FOUND MY UNUSED SICK LEAVE THAT I COULD TRANSFER NEWS FOR RETIREMENT. SO THIS IS THIS CAN BE DONE IT SHOULD BE DONE -- WHEN I WORKED WITH CAL STIRS ON THIS THEY WILL SAY -- THIS IS AND EARNED A BENEFIT AND THAT SHOULDN'T BE TAKEN AWAY BY SOME ARBITRARY TIME LIMIT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SEVEN A GOLDEN OF THE FACULTY ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES WERE PROUD TO SPONSOR THIS BILL AND I'M HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS JENNIFER BAKER WITH CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION ALSO IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL THIS IS BEEN AN ISSUE -- WE BONE ALSO WORKING ON FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS WITH CAL STIRS AND WE'RE VERY APPRECIATIVE OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER LOW'S EFFORTS TO TRY TO REMEDY THIS ISSUE I DO WANT TO PLANT A SEED THAT THIS IS. NOT GOING TO BE THE END OF THIS OVERALL DISCUSSION BECAUSE MR HANSEN WAS VERY LUCKY IN THE FACT THAT HIS DISTRICT. HAS KEPT RECORDS AND ON BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF DISTRICTS THEY MAY NOT HAVE KEPT RECORDS OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS WE HAVE HAD SOME INCIDENTS WITH MEMBERS THAT HAVE ACTUALLY TRIED TO GOING TO RECIEVE. RETRIEVE INFORMATION THE DISTRICTS HAVEN'T HAD -- INFORMATION WHEN YOU. FOR SOME DISTRICTS AND YOU GO BACK TEN TWENTY YEARS IT CAN BE MORE COMPLICATED AND WHEN YOU'RE PART TIME FACULTY MEMBER YOU DON'T NECESSARILY THINK THAT YOU HAVE TO KEEP PAY STUB. FOR TEN TWENTY OR EVEN THIRTY YEARS AND MANY PART TIMEFACULTY MEMBERS HAVE NOT REALLY UNDERSTOOD THE AS YOU GO FROM DISTRICT TO DISTRICT -- THAT YOU HAVE TO TRANSFER THAT SICK LEAVE AND SO NOW THAT MANY FULL TIME FACULTY IN ADDITION. OUR WHO USED TO BE PART TIME FACULTY MEMBERS ARE STARTING TO COME IN TO RETIREMENT THERE IS A REALIZATION OF ALL I HAVE SOMETHING THAT CAN BE USED TO PURCHASE QUALIFIED SERVICE AND CAL STIRS THE I DIDN'T EVEN REALIZE SO. IT IS GOING TO TAKE SOME TIME TO TRY TO GO BACK TO REMEDY THE SITUATION IN THE LONG RUN BUT WERE EXTREMELY APPRECIATIVE OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER LOW'S EFFORTS AND APPRECIATE.

IN A NEW A I I I LOST A LOT OF BENEFITS I I GUESS I NEED. TO CALL BACK IN THE ****. IS IT POSSIBLE. MR LOW IF YOU SEE NO OTHER QUESTIONS WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE I GET AND JUST LIKE THAT THANK THIS ANSWER FOR DRIVING ALL THE WAY UP -- TO HELP TESTIFY ON THIS VERY POINT AS SOON AS YOU CAN SEE THAT THIS WOULD TRANSCEND THE NUMBER OF DIFFERENT ISSUES AND GENERATION SO WITH RESPECT TO ASK FOR I FELT. I DO HAVE A MOTION. WE HAD A MOTION BY MISTER WHEN. SECOND BY. WELL DOCTOR CHOI ALL RIGHT. AS A PART TIME FACULTY. AND AS A TEACHER OF THIRTY FOUR YEARS. DOCTOR CHOI -- IT JUST A MATTER OF FAIRNESS JUST A MATTER OF FAIRNESS AND SICKLY ESPECIALLY AS YOU MOVE TO RETIREMENT IS LIKE BAY. AND THERE SHOULD BE NO REASON WHY YOU SHOULD ANYONE SHOULD LOSE IT -- BECAUSE IT IS JUST LIKE PAY AT THE END OF YOUR CAREER -- IT SERVES -- FOR LONGEVITY AND SENIORITY AND AND RETIREMENT SO.

OKAY IF NOT I HAVE A QUESTION NOT OF IF WITH THIS IS THE BEST RECOMMENDATION NOW WHY WAS THIS NOT -- BEEN PRESENTED BEFORE AND THE USED. WOULD YOU MIND CLARIFYING THE QUESTION THE BEST RECOMMENDATION ON THIS IS THE DESIGN BUILD A CONTRACT THOUGH SYSTEM. YOU ARE SAYING THAT SOUGHT OUT. BETTER SYSTEM -- NO WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT IT'S A BETTER SYSTEM BUT WE BELIEVE THAT COLLEGES HAVE REALLY BENEFITED FROM HAVING THE OPTION TO USE IT. IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO USE THIS PURPOSE PROCUREMENT METHOD FOR ALL PROJECTS BUT ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE THAT ARE LARGE A VERY COMPLEX AND CAN BENEFIT FROM. A VERY COLLABORATIVE PROCESS FROM THE BEGINNING TO DESIGN TO BRING TOGETHER THE TEAM BUT WE'LL BOTH DESIGN AND CONSTRUCT THE PROJECT FROM THE OUTSET. THERE ARE CERTAINLY BENEFITS TO THAT APPROACH FOR SOME PROJECTS. WE BELIEVE THAT IT SHOULD NOT BE A MANDATE BUT IT CAN BE AN OPTION -- FOR FOR SOME COLLEGES THAT CHOOSE TO USE THAT APPROACH. THIS IS A NON MANDATE JUST AN OPTION CORRECTIVE OPTION YES I SEE I WANT WHAT IT IS AN OPTION THAT THEY CURRENTLY DO HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO WHAT WAS NOT AN OPTION BEFORE -- IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN COMMUNITY ALL COMMUNITY COLLEGES RECEIVED THE AUTHORITY TO USE THE THE DESIGN BUILD PROCUREMENT. PRIOR TO THAT THERE WERE A FEW COLLEGES THAT HAD RECEIVED THE AUTHORITY TO DO SO IN A PILOT PROGRAM -- THERE ARE MANY OTHER AND STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES THAT TO HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO DO DESIGN BUILD THIS IS AN EXTENSION OF THE AUTHORITY FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE PROJECTS.

UNDER THE 67% THRESHOLD MANY FACULTY MEMBERS TEACH IN MULTIPLE CLICK CAT CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT. AT THE SAME TIME TO PIECE TOGETHER FULL TIME SCHEDULE LIMITING THEIR ABILITY TO PARTICIPATE AND CAP ISN'T COMMUNITY. AND THE RESOURCES TO THEIR STUDENTS -- TO TESTIFY WITH ME AND FAVOR THE BILL IS JIM MAILER PRESIDENT OF THE CFTC COMMUNITY COLLEGE. AND WENDY GROW. ONE COULD POINT. TO POINT. OKAY THIS. ONE TO TESTIFY WITH ME. GOING TO GO FIRST. SURE FIRST MEMBER YESTERDAY. I DON'T NEED. TO HI GOOD AFTERNOON -- CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY HIGHER ED COMMITTEE -- I AM WITH YOU PER ONE TOO BUT I'M HERE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF AB -- EIGHT NINETY SEVEN I'M THE CURRENT DEPARTMENT YOUR PHOTOGRAPHY A COLLEGE OF THE CANYONS. I AM THE ONLY FULL TIME FACULTY MEMBER MY DEPARTMENT AS THE MAJORITY OF THE COURSES THAT ARE COLLEGE ARE TAUGHT BY PART TIME FACULTY -- THIS IS TRUE. BUT MOST OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICTS BEFORE OBTAINING MY FULL TIME POSITION ECOLOGY CANYONS IN ONE SINGLE SEMESTER I TAUGHT A CLASS AT UC IRVINE. WHEN IT PEPPERED? COLLEGE IN MALIBU AND ONE AT CHIEF YOU COLLEGE IN ONTARIO. THOSE OF YOU FROM THE NORTH PROBABLY DON'T KNOW HOW FAR THOSE ARE PART BUT THEY'RE FAR APART -- I SPENT MORE TIME ON THE FREEWAY PER WEEK THAN I DID IN CLASS WITH MY STUDENTS BUT I WAS LUCKY I WAS ABLE TO LAND A FULL TIME JOB -- TEACHING POSITION I'M HERE TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF AB EIGHT NINETY SEVEN BECAUSE MOST OF OUR FACULTY ARE NOT SO LUCKY. WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PART TIME AND FULL TIME FACULTY AT THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES PART TIME FACULTY CAN TEACH UP 267%. OF WHAT IS CONSIDERED A FULL TIME LOW. AT COLLEGE OF THE CANYONS LIKE MOST COLLEGES A FULL TIME LOTUS FIFTEEN TEACHING HOURS PER WEEK. FOR PART TIME FACULTY THIS WOULD BE UP TO TEN HOURS PER WEEK PER SEMESTER. MANY OF THE PART TIME FACULTY I HIRED A COLLEGE THE CANYONS HAVE BEEN WITH US FOR MORE THAN A DECADE. AND MANY ALSO TEACH AT NEIGHBORING DISTRICTS OF INTER COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT AND LOS ANGELES COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT WE AFFECTIONATELY REFERRED TO THEM AS FREEWAY FLYERS. BUT THE REALITY IS THAT THEY DON'T HAVE A CHOICE. AND FOR A PROFESSIONAL POSITION REQUIRING A MASTER'S DEGREE OR HIGHER THIS LIMIT OF 67% TRANSLATES INTO APPROXIMATELY TWELVE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER SEMESTER AT COLLEGE OF THE CANYONS. HARDLY ENOUGH TO COVER RENT IT'S NOT JUST OUR STUDENTS THAT LIVE IN THEIR CARS AND RELY ON PUBLIC ASSISTANCE. IT'S ALSO OUR PROFESSORS. SOME OF MY FELLOW FACULTY HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THIS BILL AND I'D LIKE TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE MISCONCEPTIONS. BY COMPARISON THE UC'S AND CSU SYSTEMS DO NOT HAVE A CAP. IN PART TIME FACULTY HOURS THIS BILL WOULD ALIGN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES WITH OTHER -- INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION THE BILL DOES NOT AFFECT THE GRANT GRANTING OF TENURE TENURE IS A PRINCIPLE OF ACADEMIC FREEDOM. AND ACCORDING TO THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF UNIVERSITY PROFESSIONALS IT SHOULD BE AFFORDED TO ALL PROFESSORS REGARDLESS OF THE NUMBER OF HOURS THEY TEACH PER WEEK. IT ALSO DOESN'T CHANGE THE NUMBER OF CLASSES TAUGHT BY FULL TIME AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. THE 7525% LAW ENACTED NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF SECTIONS TAUGHT BY FULL TIME FACULTY 275%. HAS CREATED AN ARTIFICIAL CEILING WITH THE WITH THE MANDATE OF DISTRICTS FULL TIME OBLIGATION NUMBER OR FINE. THE FINE WAS MEANT TO BE THE FLOOR A BARE MINIMUM NUMBER FULL TIME FACULTY AT EACH DISTRICT HOWEVER DISTRICTS HAVE NO INCENTIVE CENTER OF TO HIGHER ABOVE THE FINE. ON THIS BILL WILL NOT INCREASE COSTS TO CAL STIRS OR HEALTH CARE. EXCUSE ME AB. EIGHT EIGHT NINETY SEVEN WOULD ALLOW EACH LOCAL DISTRICT TO COLLECTIVELY BARGAIN FOR PART TIME FACULTY TO TEACH UP 285% OF FULL TIME FACULTY AT LOAD. THE BILL WOULD ALLOW PART TIME FACULTY TO DECIDE TO DEDICATE MORE TIME TO TEACHING AT A SINGLE CAMPUS AND LAST TIME COMMUTING BETWEEN CAMPUSES. PART TIME FACULTY WOULD HAVE MORE TIME TO DEVOTE TO MEETING WITH STUDENTS AND PARTICIPATING IN THE GOVERNANCE THE COLLEGE. RATHER THAN RUNNING OUT THE DOOR TO DRIVE TO AN ADJACENT DISTRICT PIECING TOGETHER A LIVING AND ROLL DISTRICTS WHERE IT IS DIFFICULT TO HIRE ENOUGH FACULTY. AB EIGHT NINETY SEVEN WOULD ALLOW COLLEGES TO OFFER CLASS SECTIONS MORE CLASS SECTIONS TO A SINGLE PART TIME FACULTY MEMBER. ALTHOUGH AB EIGHT NINETY SEVEN DOES NOT ADDRESS THE NEED FOR MORE FULL TIME FACULTY IT DOES PROVIDE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR PART TIME FACULTY TO HAVE A GREATER IMPACT ON THE LIFE OF OUR STUDENTS AND THEIR SUCCESS THANK YOU [inaudible] OKAY. AS THE SECOND [inaudible] WITNESS. YEAH JIM MILLER -- PRESIDENT COMMUNITY COLLEGE COUNCIL CALIFORNIA FEDERATION OF TEACHERS -- TO ADD ON TO WHAT MY COLLEAGUE JUST SAID. AND THIS WILL ALSO BE A COST SAVINGS TO DISTRICTS BECAUSE WE WOULD HAVE. FEWER HEADS TO YOU KNOW EMPLOYEE BECAUSE OF EACH PERSON COULD TEACH A HIGHER LOAD WE WOULDN'T HAVE TO HIRE AS MANY PEOPLE. IN EACH DISTRICT IT TAKE TEACH THE SAME NUMBER OF CLASSES SO THERE'D BE LESS OVERHEAD LESS BUREAUCRACY FOR THE DISTRICTS -- TO DEAL WITH AND IT WOULD CREATE A LITTLE BIT OF A BETTER LIFESTYLE FOR ADJUNCT FACULTY WHO ARE ALREADY. NO PART OF A TWO TIER SYSTEM BUT IT WOULD GIVE THEM A LITTLE BIT MORE STABILITY. LITTLE BIT MORE DEDICATION TO THE INSTITUTION WHERE THEY COULD DO A HIGHER LOAD AND NOT HAVE TO TRAVEL THE FREEWAY AS MUCH. SO I HOPE THAT YOU CAN ALL VOTE IN FAVOUR THANK YOU. BRIAN HOW THE CALIFORNIA FEDERATION OF TEACHERS WERE ONE OF THE CO SPONSORS OF THIS BILL. OKAY ANY EDITION ARTIST SUPPORT MEMBERS SO IN THE AUDIENCE.

IS. BASICALLY WAVES TUITION FOR STUDENTS WHO HAVE HAD PARENTS WHO -- WHO LOST THEIR PARENTS IN THE LINE OF DUTY AND? THEIR TUITION IS WAIVED BUT NOT THE MANDATORY FEES THAT WE HAVE TO PAY A STUDENTS LIKE THE CAMPUS SPACE FEES SO THESE FEES CAN RANGE FROM. I KNOW IT'S SOME COLLEGES THERE LIKE ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY DOLLARS BUT THEY CAN BE UP TO TWO HUNDRED THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS. AND ON TOP OF ALSO PAYING FOR BOOKS AND ANY OTHER THINGS MAYBE TUTORING AND OTHER THINGS THAT YOU MIGHT NEED TO GET IN. A SUFFICIENT EDUCATION. THINGS LIKE THIS CAN ADD UP AND FOR AS WE KNOW STUDENTS WITH SINGLE PARENTS.

FIFTEEN OH FOUR WOULD GIVE COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS THE SAME KIND OF STUDENT REPRESENTATION. THAT WE SEE THAT CSU STUDENTS AND YOU SEE STUDENTS HAVE. YOU SEE STUDENTS AND CSU STUDENTS HAVE THE ABILITY. TO COLLECT [inaudible] A FEE [inaudible] HE FOR STUDENT ACTIVISM FOR STUDENT -- LOBBYING ON THE ISSUES THAT THE STUDENTS MOST CARE ABOUT AND THEY USE THOSE. AMONG OTHER THINGS TO COME HERE AND INTERACT WITH US -- AND TO BRING FORWARD THE THEIR CONCERNS AND THEIR ISSUES. AND SO I THINK IT IS A VERY EFFECTIVE WAY THE CSU STUDENTS AND YOU SEE STUDENTS HAVE -- TO VOICE THEIR CONCERNS UNFORTUNATELY COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS DON'T HAVE. THE WAY OF COLLECTING MONEY FROM THEIR STUDENT BODIES OF BECAUSE IT TAKES A AN ELECTION ON THEIR CAMPUSES. SO RIGHT NOW ONLY ELEVEN OUT OF THE HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN COMMUNITY COLLEGE CAMPUSES HAVE. IMPLEMENTED A TWO DOLLAR FEE WHICH IS WHAT THE STUDENTS ARE ASKING FOR THE STUDENTS. A VAST. AND I'M HAPPY TO BE THE SPONSOR OF THEIR BILL AB -- FIFTEEN FOR THAT WOULD ALLOW COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO IMPOSE A TWO DOLLAR FEE SO THAT COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS COULD HAVE. THE SAME REPRESENTATION APPEAR AS A CSU AND YOU SEE STUDENTS SO WITH ME TODAY. IS [inaudible] LEISHA. YOUNGBLOOD. I THINK YOU SHOULD AYE AYSHA. EXCUSE ME. PRESIDENT OF THE STUDENT SENATE -- FOR CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES [inaudible] AND ALSO HERE TO TESTIFY ON BEHALF OF THE BILL. OKAY I WITNESS. HI YEAH SO WE WOULD REALLY LIKE YOUR SUPPORT IN THIS BILL SO THAT WE CAN IN REALLY. LEVERAGE OUR STUDENTS VOICE IS AN ADVOCATE FOR THEM THE SAME WAY OUR COUNTERPARTS AT THE UCSC ISSUES DO CURRENTLY THIS CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE OPERATES AT A BUDGET OF LIKE THIRTEEN CENTS PER STUDENT WHEN WE REPRESENT TWO POINT ONE MILLION STUDENTS IN THE SYSTEM. VERSUS OUR COUNTERPART TO OPERATE AT NEARLY THREE DOLLARS PER STUDENT SO WITH THIS WE CAN SPEND MORE TIME SACRAMENTO LOBBYING FOR BILLS THAT REALLY AFFECT US IN OUR STUDENTS -- WE CAN DO REGIONAL. SUPPORT AND LEADERSHIP TRAINING WE CAN. REALLY. THE SKY'S THE LIMIT IF YOU HAVE THE MONEY AND ULTIMATELY WE CAN GET PROFESSIONAL STAFF BECAUSE AT THIS POINT WHERE THE ONLY STUDENT RUN ORGANIZATION THAT LEAVES LITERALLY. STUDENT RAN -- WE DO ALL OF OUR MEETINGS OURSELVES LIKE EVERYTHING SO WE WERE REALLY LOOKING FOR YOUR SUPPORT IN THIS. SEVEN WITH THE WITNESS SORRY. HI -- COMMITTEE MEMBERS OF ACTING CHAIR. THIS IS WORKING OF MY NAME IS TO BE FOUND AND I'M ALSO PART OF THE STUDENT CENTER FOR CALIFORNIA TWENTY COLLEGES. I'M WITH REGION FOR WHICH COVERS THE IS SO COMPELLING IT ALL THROUGHOUT -- THE SOUTH BAY AND SO WITH -- THE TWO SRF -- AS A STRIP WILL SEE AS A WHOLE WOULD HAVE SO MUCH MORE POTENTIAL TO JUST GIVE BACK TO WHERE IT CONSTITUENTS BASICALLY ALL TWO POINT ONE MILLION OF THEM. AND IT'S BASICALLY AN INJUSTICE TO SEE AN ADVOCATE SEE WHEN YOU COMPARE IT TO THE CSU AND YOU SEE SYSTEM. WHO RECEIVES A TIME FROM A TON OF MORE MONEY THAN WE DO? AND THEY'RE ABLE TO DO SO MUCH MORE AND IN COMPARISON TO THAT WE'RE JUST STRUGGLING. TO REALLY HAVE A VOICE IS SET UP TO THE CAPITOL IN SACRAMENTO -- OCCASIONALLY WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO GO TO WASHINGTON DC AND SO YOU SEE THE DISPARITY WHEN YOU COMPARE THOSE. THREE SYSTEMS -- ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU BREAK IT DOWN TO THE REGIONAL LEVEL -- AND SO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS WHICH ABOVE ME ARE MYSELF IN ASIA SAID ON AYE AYSHA OF OVERSEAS EVERYTHING IN BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THE REGIONS -- MYSELF REPRESENTING VISION FOR AS THE REGIONAL AFFAIRS DR -- WE HAVE OUR OWN INDIVIDUAL BUDGET AND THAT BUDGET IS VERY VERY SMALL AND WE MAKE THE BEST WITH WHAT WE HAVE. BUT THAT ALSO LIMITS OUR CAPABILITY AND HOSTING EVENTS -- GOING TO CONFERENCES -- ATTENDING DIFFERENT CONFERENCES THAT MAY BE TOO FAR AWAY AND REQUIRE EXTENSIVE TRAVEL AND WE ALSO HAVE ISSUES WITH JUST. GETTING DIFFERENT DISTRICTS TO SUPPORT. OUR REGION BECAUSE EACH INDIVIDUAL COLLEGES ALSO STRUGGLING IN SOME WAY -- DUE TO FINANCIAL RESTRICTIONS AND SO I'M REALLY HERE TODAY TO REALLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND AB FIFTY NO FOUR THANK YOU. IN ADDITION ORDER. SUPPORT SO FROM THE AUDIENCE. SEVEN GOLDEN AT THE FACULTY ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND SUPPORT. CAN MY CAR WITH WAVY P. OF LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS THIS INSIDE OF CALIFORNIA'S ME CARTER'S. CLERK FOR THE ASSOCIATED SINCE SUMMERSIDE COLLEGE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR SUPPORT. MICHELLE HALL REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE FACILITY AND THE DISTRICT BEING TWO OF THE ELEVEN COLLEGES THAT PAY INTO THE TO ANSWER IF WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS BILL. OTHER JOHNSON FROM CERRITOS COLLEGE IN SUPPORT. HI CAN YOU HEAR ENDOZA IN A CLUB COUNCIL CHARITABLE VALLEY COLLEGE BEING ONE OF THE COLLEGES THAT PAYS THIS BE WE STRONGLY SUPPORT. DANNY THEIR COAST INTERESTED FOR LOS RESIDENTES STUDENT AT SACRAMENTO CITY COLLEGE IN SUPPORT. MONTEL CAUGHT MONTEL FLIGHT FROM PRAGUE TO UNIFY -- TO ME COLLEGES SO SUPPORT. MAGALI KINCAID WITH PUBLIC ADVOCATES IN STRONG SUPPORT. THE AMISH JOHNSON FOR MERRITT COLLEGE IN STRONG SUPPORT AND ALSO THE REGION THREE TEAR THAT HAS THE ELBOW VALLEY COLLEGE CONTRA COSTA. AND ELHAM SEE THE OLD ONE OF THE ELEVEN COLLEGES THAT ARE SUPPORTING. HI TWENTY ROLLING COOPER IS A FACULTY MEMBER AT THE CAN'T CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES ONE WHO LOVES HER STUDENTS I SUPPORT. THANK YOU ANY OPPOSITION THIS. OKAY IF NOT THEN THE MEMBERS QUESTIONS -- IF NOT THEN I HAVE A QUESTION -- IF. FOR THIS BILL OF PASSES SO THAT WILL. ELIMINATE THE REQUIREMENT OF DESTROYING THE SENATE TO VOTE THAT THE THROUGH THE ELECTION NIGHT FOR ANY ASSESSMENT FEES SAYS THAT THOUGH YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE SENATE MEMBERS. MORE ON THAT. NO SO WHAT THIS. TO DO SO CURRENTLY IN ED COAT THE WAY THAT THE FEES IMPLEMENTED ON CAMPUS IS THAT EACH A HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN ASSOC. BUT STUDENT BODIES HAVE TO VOTE ON IT IN. IT'S IT'S LIKE STRENUOUSLY LIKE DOESN'T WORK SO THIS WOULD IMPLEMENT THE FEE AS I OPT OUT SO STUDENTS STILL HAVE THE ABILITY TO OPT OUT FROM THE FEE. OKAY I WONDER IF INDIVIDUAL STUDENTS. INDIVIDUALS. TO THIS ELECTION IS SO WHAT THE CAMPUS BASED -- ARE SYSTEM WIDE. THE SPACE CAMPUS BASED. MONA STERN SENATE MEMBERS MIGHT KNOW THE WHOLE STUDENT BODY HOLSTER ON BODY I SEE. SO IT HAS -- GIVEN YOU -- DIFFICULTY TO ROUTE TO CHARGE TWO DOLLARS. YEAH IF I MAY. RESPOND MOST RECENTLY. AS A ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY AND I HAVE BEEN WORKING AND SUB ONE ON ON TRYING TO REFORM OF THE CAL GRANT -- PROGRAM -- WE'VE SEEN STUDENTS COME FROM UC CSU. IN LARGE NUMBERS. AND I THINK THEY COME IN LARGE NUMBERS BECAUSE THEY HAVE A SYSTEM IN PLACE FOR STUDENT REPRESENTATION THEIR STUDENT ORGANIZATIONS THAT REPRESENT THEM. A MOBILIZE THE STUDENTS AT BOTH OF THOSE SYSTEMS AND WHEN WE HAD TWO DIFFERENT DAYS ONE FOR CSU STUDENTS. AND ONE FOR UC'S STUDENTS AND THERE WERE HUNDREDS OF STUDENTS. FROM EACH OF THOSE -- IT SYSTEMS ON THOSE DAYS. BUT WHEN IT COMES TO TRYING TO GET COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS HERE -- TOO ALSO LOBBY ON ON ISSUES THAT ARE MOST AFFECTING THEM IT IS DIFFICULT TO GET STUDENTS TO COME HERE. BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THE EQUIVALENT KIND OF ORGANIZATIONS BECAUSE IT IS SO DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO IMPOSE. THIS TO DOLLAR FEES THAT WOULD HELP THEM ORGANIZE. SO I I I I SEE THAT AS A THE REASON WHY THIS BILL IS IS NEEDED. YEAH I UNDERSTAND THE NEED FOR THE FUND FOR THE SPIRIT. STUDENT REPRESENTATIVES OF TOTAL WATER LAPPING WORK. AND WORK WITH THE CAPITAL APPEAR A WEAVER. I AM A LITTLE BIT CONCERNED ABOUT THE ELIMINATING THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS. AND THE GOVERNMENT IS SUCH TRYING TO IMPOSE. YOU YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO VOTE THE DETERMINE THAT YOU OR YOUR OWN SHE SAID IN THE WE MANDATING THEM. JUST THE TWO CHARGES ANY STORE IN TWO DOLLARS EVEN THOUGH THAT'S A SMALL AMOUNT. AND THEN A THAT'S MY FEELING AND THE SECOND SECOND QUESTION IS THAT THE US YES YOU AND DO YOU SEE IT -- STUDENTS SO DO THEY DETERMINE THE FEES SO ARE HAVE WE DECIDED THEIR FEES I I I DON'T KNOW FOR SURE DOCTOR CHOI BUT I WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED IF THE STUDENTS. DON'T DETERMINE THE FEE THEMSELVES BUT I I I DON'T KNOW ABSOLUTELY -- THIS IS STUDENTS AND THE STUDENT ORGANIZATION. I THINK THAT SPEAK ON BEHALF OF STUDENTS -- TRYING TO MAKE IT EASIER -- FOR THEM TO HAVE BETTER REPRESENTATION HE I YEAH I HEARD THEM -- BUT THE THIS IS SO IN THE SPIRIT OF WHAT A DEMOCRACY. IS A SELF GOVERNING AND THE HERE GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS A STATE LEGISLATURE TRIED TO TELL THEM MICHAEL MANAGING STUDENTS -- DECISION ON FEES RIGHT AND AN END TO THAT I I WOULD. JUST SAY THIS THIS WAS NOT A BILL THAT I THOUGHT UP THIS WAS NOT A BILL. THAT. I THOUGHT OF THE STUDENTS CAME TO ME. AND ASKS ME. I THINK FOR THE REASONS THAT DAVE EXPRESS. IF I WOULD. ON THEIR BEHALF. OF BRING THIS BILL FORWARD WHICH I WAS HAPPY TO DO. SO IT CAME FROM THE STUDENTS. OKAY I UNDERSTAND DOT OUR SUPPORT IF THE COST IS A TWO DOLLARS. EACH PERSON IS A SMALL AMOUNT THE AND THAT THAT CAN GIVE THEM THE ABILITY. TO DO THE JOB BUT THEY ARE CURRENTLY DOING AND THE DUST IN IMPORTANT BUT I I THINK YOU NEED -- TO CANNOT TELL A US TOUR AND SENATE. WE DID NOT THE VOLUNTEER TO TO ELIMINATE THEIR RIGHT TO DETERMINE THEIR SELF ASSESSMENT. IT IS A MORE OFFER YOU ARE ADVOCATING TO US HEY YOU. MAKERS CHARGE YOU YOU LEGISLATORS SO YOU YOU DEMAND US UP THE REQUIRE US TO TO PAY TWO DOLLARS SO SO BLAME IS -- FORTY ONE MY LAPSE. IS TERRIBLE. ODYSSEUS IS IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN NOT MORE OF A SELF DETERMINATION BY THE STATE RUN BODY. YOU KNOW IF YOU NEEDED IT. DâN NON THEY SHOULD BE EASY. TO DETERMINE THE TWO DOLLARS THE STAFF ASSESSMENT. BUT THE WE ARE TELLING THEM HEY YOU GUYS EVERYBODY YOU DON'T PAY TWO DOLLARS SO SO THAT'S A LITTLE BIT STOP BOTHERING ME AS TO IN THE DEMOCRATS DEMOCRATIC WHY DO THEY HAVE WESTERN SET. TO BEGIN WITH. I UNDERSTAND YOUR POINT OKAY. AND THEN -- AND IS A SECOND THIS. THIS THIS FREE SYSTEM EXIST AT THE C. ISSUES. AND THE UC'S -- AND THEY HAVE TO COME TO US TO GET THIS. THIS SELFIE THAT THAT THAT THEY'RE ASKING FOR OUR AND SO YOU SEE ISSUE YOU SEE A FEW YEARS AGO I KNOW THEY WENT FROM ONE DOLLAR TO TWO DOLLARS. A REYES IT ONE DOLLAR THEY HAD TO COME TO US TO DO IT BECAUSE THERE'S SOME. SOME ISSUES IN THE LAW THAT PREVENTS THEM FROM DOING THESE EXTRA THINGS LIKE THIS ON THEIR OWN -- AND AS A RESULT COMMUNITY COLLEGES WERE NOT INCLUDED. THIS IS NOT IN COMMON THE STUDENT COMMITTEE COLLEGE IT'S COME NOW TO ASK TO BE TREATED LIKE THIS ISSUE IN THE UC. TO HAVE FUN SO THEY CAN RUN THEIR STUDENT ORGANIZATION THAT ANY STUDENT ON THE CAMPUS CAN DECIDE THEY DON'T WANT TO PAY THE TWO DOLLARS. AND THEY DON'T HAVE. TO ALSO IT'S ALMOST LIKE A FEE THAT IS AN OPTIONAL FEE BECAUSE WHEN YOU WHEN YOU REGISTER YOU SAY KIND OF LIKE IF YOU FOLLOW NEW TAXES AND YOU WANT TO GET SOME MONEY FOR CAMPAIGNS WHATEVER YOU CAN'T. THAT'S AN OPTION BUT IT'S NOT A REQUIREMENT SO NOW THEY HAVE THIS OPTION THAT THEY CAN DO AT THIS STUDENT SAY YEAH I'LL GIVE TWO DOLLARS TO THE STUDENT BODY. THEN A DOLLAR THAT HAS TO GO TO THE ASSOCIATION -- WHAT THEY DIDN'T HAVE THAT OPTION BEFORE IN THE C. ISSUE HAS IT AND THE UC HAS IT AND THAT'S WHY THEY SAYING THAT THOSE CAMPUSES ARE MUCH MORE ACTIVE? MORE ENGAGE CAN GO TO WORKSHOPS AND SEMINARS TO HELP THE STUDENTS TO GROW AS STUDENTS BECAUSE THEY HAVE THIS MONEY IN THE SYSTEM THAT COMES FROM FEET FROM FROM A STUDENT FEE OF TWO DOLLARS. WE GET A DOLLAR BUT FOR THEIR ASSOCIATION BUT A STUDENT CAN SAY I DON'T WANT TO PAY JUST LIKE YOU DON'T HAVE TO CHECK THAT BOX WHEN YOU FILE YOUR IS THE TRUTH CHIP GERMAN. THIS IS OPTIONAL BUT IF THEY HAVE A OPT OUT I HAVE NOT TAKEN UP YEAH. ABOUT THINGS I'M NOT GOING I DON'T WANT TO IT YEAH BUT IT'S NOT AN OPT IN BUT IT'S NOT BAD OKAY IF THIS OF THE HOUSES OUT OF THE NOT THE OPTION IN THE AIR YEAH THEY DO. SO I I THINK THAT'S MORE FLEXIBLE. OKAY THEN NOT WE USED A PROMOTION PLEASE. THE MOTION IS DUE PASSED TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE OKAY CALDERON.
