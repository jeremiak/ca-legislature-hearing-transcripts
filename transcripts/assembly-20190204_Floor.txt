THAT THAT'S WHAT BASICALLY WITH NO EXPLANATION THESE FOLKS DON'T EVEN SPEAK SPANISH MOST OF THE TIME THEY SPEAK A DIALECT OF INDIGENOUS -- GUATEMALAN. LANGUAGES AND IT'S IT'S AMAZING TO ME. THAT SOMETHING THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN ABLE TO DO FOR SO LONG WITH STOPS SO ABRUPTLY AND LEFT SO MANY PEOPLE IN A VULNERABLE POSITION IT MAKES THEM VULNERABLE TO HUMAN TRAFFICKING. AND IT MAKES OUR SHELTERS ARE HOMELESS SHELTERS VULNERABLE TO HAVING MORE PEOPLE THERE QUITE FRANKLY BECAUSE WHAT ARE THESE PEOPLE SUPPOSED TO DO. THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE A GUIDE TO WHERE THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE GETTING SO THESE ORGANIZATIONS IN SAN DIEGO THEY THEY STEPPED UP THEY'VE BEEN FILLING THAT VOID. BUT THANK GOD WE HAVE A GOVERNOR WHO WENT DOWN THERE TO LOOK TO SAID WE NEED TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION THIS IS A SOLUTION THAT ALL OF US HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY.

SMITH YOU MAY OPEN. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS. I RISE TO ASK YOUR SUPPORT FOR H. R.. NINE I RISE IN HONOR OF MY MOM GAIL FISHER WHO DIED OF CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE IN MARCH OF TWENTY FIFTEEN MY MOM WAS A CRITICAL CARE REGISTERED NURSE. SHE HAS SPENT MOST OF HER NURSING CAREER IN CARDIAC SURGERY. AND IN CARDIAC SURGERY RECOVERY IN THE I SEE YOU. WELL SHE CERTAINLY FOUND HERSELF IN SEVERAL RISK CATEGORIES FOR HEART DISEASE AS A LIFELONG SMOKER. SOMEONE WHO STRUGGLE TO MAINTAIN A HEALTHY WEIGHT AND AS A TYPE TWO DIABETES SUFFER WHEN SHE HAD HER FIRST HEART ATTACK AT THE AGE OF FORTY SEVEN EVEN AS A CRITICAL CARE NURSE. SHE DID NOT ACCURATELY READ HER OWN. LIKE MANY WOMEN EXPERIENCING A HEART ATTACK HER PRESENTING SYMPTOMS WERE A TYPICAL. LEADING HER TO DELAY SEEKING TREATMENT. HER FIRST PARTY APART ATTACK WAS TREATED WITH ANGIOPLASTY AN ASSISTANT AND WAS FOLLOWED BY A SECOND HEART ATTACK TWO YEARS LATER. FORTUNATELY LIFESTYLE CHANGES AND MORE DILIGENT CARDIAC CARE KEPT HER WITH US TWENTY MORE YEARS. YET A LIFETIME OF DAMAGE HAD BEEN DONE TO HER HEART AND IT FAILED HER AT THE AGE OF SIXTY SEVEN WHEN SHE HAD SO MUCH MORE LIFE TO GIVE. THIS RESOLUTION SEEKS TO RAISE AWARENESS OF THE IMPACT OF HEART DISEASE ON WOMEN BY RECOGNIZING THE GO RED FOR WOMEN MOVEMENT. FEBRUARY IS AMERICAN HEART MONTH SO WHAT IS AN IDEAL TIME TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE ESPECIALLY WOMEN. TO FOCUS ON THEIR HEARTS AND TO GET THEIR FAMILIES FRIENDS AND COMMUNITIES INVOLVED. DISEASE IS THE NUMBER ONE KILLER OF WOMEN. TAKING MORE LIVES THAN ALL FORMS OF CANCER COMBINED. ALMOST HALF OF ALL CARDIOVASCULAR DEATHS OCCUR IN WOMEN. CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES KILL ONE WOMAN ABOUT EVERY EIGHTY SECONDS. AND YET ABOUT 80% OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES CAN BE PREVENTED. THE STATISTICS ARE STAGGERING. MORE THAN ONE IN THREE WOMEN IS LIVING WITH SOME FORM OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE. WHEN IT COMES TO STROKES FOUR MILLION STROKE SURVIVORS ALIVE TODAY ARE WOMEN? NEARLY 60% OF STROKE DEATHS ARE IN WOMEN. EACH YEAR ABOUT FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND MORE FEMALES THAN MALES HAVE A STROKE. WOMEN HAVE A HIGHER LIFETIME RISK OF STROKE THAN MEN. HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE OR HYPERTENSION IS THE SECOND REASON LEADING CAUSE OF PREVENTABLE HEART DISEASE AND STROKE DEATH SECOND ONLY TO SMOKING. MORE THAN 30% OF CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS AND WOMEN ARE DUE TO HYPERTENSION. MEMBERS THIS RESOLUTION IS VERY PERSONALLY IMPORTANT TO ME. BUT HEART DISEASE WILL TOUCH EACH OF US AT SOME POINT. SO THIS IS WHY IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE TAKE THE TIME EACH YEAR TO RECOGNIZE WHERE RED FOR WOMEN DAY HERE IN THE CAPITAL AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY. THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION THE AMERICAN STROKE ASSOCIATION AND OTHERS HAVE WORK TO RAISE AWARENESS OF THE IMPORTANCE OF CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH AND HOW WE CAN IMPROVE OUTCOMES FOR WOMEN AND ALL AMERICANS. AWARENESS IS THE FIRST STEP. KNOW YOUR NUMBERS TOTAL CHOLESTEROL HDL THE GOOD CHOLESTEROL BLOOD PRESSURE BLOOD SUGAR AND BODY MASS INDEX. TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR ABOUT WAYS TO LOWER YOUR HEART HEALTH RISK. MOVE MORE MAKE PHYSICALACTIVITY A PRIORITY IN YOUR LIFE AND FOR YOUR LOVED ONES. IT SMART MAKE HEALTHY FOOD AND BEVERAGE CHOICES A PART OF YOUR LIFESTYLE. REDUCE SODIUM INTAKE THAT ONE'S FOR MY DAUGHTER. LIMIT OR ELIMINATE HIGH SUGARY DRINK CONCEPTION THAT ONCE FOR MY OTHER DAUGHTER AND EAT MORE FRUITS AND VEGETABLES THAT'S FOR BOTH OF MY KIDS. AND FINALLY MONITOR YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE IF YOU HAVE HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE MONITOR IT REGULARLY AND TRACK IT. I'M IN THE GALLERY WITH US TODAY WE ARE WELCOMING LILY ROCHA THE OFFICIAL SPOKESPERSON FOR THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION AND A VOLUNTEER WITH THE ASSOCIATION FOR MANY YEARS. AT THE AGE OF JUST THIRTY SEVEN SHE SUFFERED A HEART ATTACK NOW TEN YEARS AFTER THE UNEXPECTED HEART ATTACK LEE HAS MADE HEART HEALTH AND ADVOCACY FOR HEART HEALTH HER PRIORITY. I'D LIKE TO THANK HER FOR TRAVELING TO SACRAMENTO TODAY AS WELL AS THE OTHER AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION VOLUNTEERS ALSO IN THE GALLERY. I WANT TO RECOGNIZE AND COMMEND HER AND THE REST OF THE VOLUNTEERS FOR THEIR HARD WORK AND DEDICATION TO THIS IMPORTANT CAUSE.
