you will start with us before for two -- and welcome you to a to present thank you Mister chair -- Committee let me get my so to give him an F. and I will be doing this from the day since we don't yet have the podium through a guests were probably saving up for that yeah good morning Mister chair and senators -- I'm here before you today to prison as before for to a bill that will ensure the California school districts are able to smoothly make a transition from at large elections to district based elections without incurring the cost and delays of California voting rights act lawsuits during that process since the passage of the California voting rights act in two thousand one to promote greater representation and equity elections more than two hundred of California's one thousand thirty seven school districts have since switched from at large elections to district based systems for the election of trustees in recent years it has been the consistent policy of both is the of this legislation to encourage political subdivisions to adopt district based elections while giving to simplify the process for doing so toward that end California education code section five zero one nine currently allows County committees that oversee the organizations school districts to establish trustee area elections in a prompt and inclusive process unfortunately as a result of an Akron isn't and state law school districts governed by a board of education provided for as part of the charter of the city or county are not entitled to the same process and are instead required to put any ordinance on establishing trust your trust year elections to the electors of the district which is a burdensome requirements often results in the need to hold in to pay for an official election in practice school districts and bypass the stature requirement by securing a waiver from the state board of education this extra step however still adds time an additional cost to the adoption of trustee -- elections with the unfortunate and ironic result that socialists have actually resulted in the holding of such an at large elections which are found to be in violation of the California voting rights act simply put these unnecessary and unproductive complexities can result in costly litigation and subsequent unlawful at large elections that perpetuate the dilution of minority voters in violation of either the spirit or the letter of the CVR ag SB four four two fixes this problem by allowing ordinances approving a proposed and to establish trustee areas to take effect immediately upon adoption without the need for an additional election to affirm approval under the terms of the bill is provisions would apply to all elections for governing board members more than one hundred twenty five days following its chapter and I'd like to thank the committee staff for their hard work in calibrating fine tuning its terms in the language governing them and I will be accepting amendments recommended by the committee that reconcile the bill was School District which you've already created independent redistricting commissions for the purpose of transitioning to district elections with these changes incorporated S. before for two will go far in streamlining the transition process for the election school district trustees while eliminating delays and additional costs borne by taxpayers resulting from delays and prospective litigation this bill is supported by the California teachers association the southwest voter registration education project and currently has no formal opposition with me today virtually is Michelle Warshaw from the California department of education to answer any technical questions with respect to the provisions of the law I am

the spotlight and ask if you would that present SB five eighty three -- thank you lord is yours thank you Mister chair as part of my bag full of bills this morning AB Mister chair and members advocated be have SB five eight three which will build out and implement a backend automatic voter registration system at the California department of vehicles and other relevant state agencies thereby taking the next logical step forward on expanding voter registration California to safely effectively and accurately include as many eligible Californians possible in our democratic process implementing backend AV R. as it is known will build on California's successful implementation of the new motor voter system to create a more efficient effective and secure process for registering new voters updating existing registrations and protecting noncitizens Colorado Oregon Alaska and Massachusetts of all passed legislation to embrace and implement back in every our intifada has a similar model under California's current hard stop voter registration DMV customers are asked a yes or no registration question during the DMV's current flow during typical DMV transactions such as applying for or renewing a license or ID card at present despite the relative ease the motor voter large numbers of Californians opt to decline to register to vote or to update their voter registration records for a range of reasons which include one they arrived to believe they're already registered to vote or that their voter registration is already up to date second they may be in a rush to leave the DMV and fully intend to do so later -- but failed to do so at a later time third that they're confused or unsure of their current rights and options with respect to both a registration this is a particular problem for formerly incarcerated individuals as well as for sixteen and seventeen year olds who are now eligible for pre reg registration as a result of recent changes in California law this so called hard stop system leads to close to fifty percent of DMV customers declining voter registration the net result of that roughly four million yeah direct net result is that roughly four million eligible Californians failed to register to vote despite being fully qualified to do so in a do Chen and perhaps more problematically the current system fails to catch an update millions of voter registration records that contain out of date information creating problems further down the line when it comes to voting SB five eight three would plug these current leaks in the information pipeline a person who is not currently registered to vote but who provides proof of US citizenship such as a passport or birth certificate during a do you the transaction would automatically have their information passed to the secretary of state for registration to include associating any language preference expressed during the DMV transactions county registrars within receive notice with the information for the new voter county registrar's offices within mail these new registrants a multi lingual notice offering the chance to decline registration as well as the option of choosing a party affiliation selecting or changing their language preference or receiving a ballot by mail the person could then return this notice on a prepaid postage basis as well as make any changes online in Colorado which is currently employing a back and if your system similar to the one being proposed here in contrast to the roughly forty five percent of Californians who declined to register under our current implementation of motor voter only one percent of Coloradans to receive mail notices decline registration at the same time since its implementation of back and if you are Colorado DMV transaction times have been reduced as well by up to seventy five seconds per customer in the last review it's worth noting that the California department of motor vehicles is already collecting and recording information with respect to the type of identity documents a person provides an automated back in system like those state like states like Colorado uses would simply leverages on going work flow to ascertain eligibility enrollment for voting in a more streamlined and secure way as noted implementing back in eighty are would also streamlined registration updates if an existing registered voter provides an address your name to the DMV that differs from registration records the DMV would then automatically for that change of information to elected officials for updating in their records the voter would then receive a notice by mail of the change to include the opportunity to make any additional updates or corrections because someone registered voters may not provide proof of citizenship during certain DMV transactions the provisions of SB five eight three would maintain the current motor voter system for unregistered people who do not provide proof of US citizenship ship during DMV transactions and to ensure appropriate protections for non citizens the back in AB are system would automatically filter out DMV customers who have provided documents establishing foreign citizenship such as a green card applicants for an AB sixty license these DMV customers would not be offered the chance to register and would not have any of their information passed on by the system to election officials by contrast the current system offers all DMV customers the opportunity to register to vote even if they have provided proof of provided proof of non citizenship as part of their transaction this quirk of the current system exposes non citizens to a needless trap if they make a mistake when faced with citizenship and registration questions as a result in attention confusion or of limited English proficiency they can inadvertently expose themselves to potentially catastrophic criminal and immigration consequences finally recognizing that the DMV does not reach all eligible voters the bill would give the sector State the authority to extend back in AB are to other state agencies that procedurally verify U. S. citizenship as part of standard agency transactions as is the case with medi cal enrollment program run by DH CS the implementation back in AB are proposed by SB five eight three offers a range of benefits and improvements compared to the current system to include an easier more streamlined workflow for the DMV safely and accurately expanding the number of registered California voters ensuring a more diverse electorate is appropriate reflective of California's diverse and dynamic population continually updating records enabling more accurate voter registration databases thereby reducing work by County registrar offices enhance protections for non citizens against unintentional or run his voter registration substantial labor and cost savings over time for the DMV the better and more efficiently enabling rights restoration for formerly incarcerated Californians who are eligible to vote but may not be so aware over the past decade California has made great strides in engaging its citizens in removing barriers to political participation and we can be proud to see that reflected both in the historically high rates of turnout by California voters in most recent round of elections as well as the continued trencher diversely in more proportional representation of women and people and of color at every level of elected governing bodies in our great state SB five eight three represents the next logical step in that process with me virtually to testify today I just of the level of from the coalition of humane immigrant rights to discuss the on the ground issues created by the current system and Neil or beyond from the center for secure and modern elections to answer any technical questions regarding bill language I would like to finish by stating that I am committed to continue to work collaborate with all stakeholders and state agencies as we move this bill through the legislative process I respectfully request your aye vote today thank you senator Newman -- we're now going to move on to those who wish to testify in support I understand you have a primary witness in support Joseph the Ella for the coalition for humane immigrant rights and so will ask the moderators to open up his line so we can hear his testimony and if you're there to testify your line should be open just go ahead and move yourself thank you -- good morning I can't I members my name is Joseph have you got a policy check back here let the coalition for humane immigrant right we are statewide membership organization with national impact we are here about but Bonta A. B. by eighty three which will provide an automatic voter registration them and it's much safer or not that that thank like when your current that that California currently currently has a hard stop AB ours that they mean which the N. B. customers what black for life and other than AB if I were like that my answer to question one I get that it's been into you want to register to vote not that there's will have limited proficiency but understand this question the time allows fearful of government interaction and can get tripped during that stressful transaction they can't will correctly a path to citizenship and register to vote through example human error without some of these issues when that system was implemented in twenty eighteen my organization CHIRLA work closely with secretary of state and department of justice by Dennis by an address this problem I know we have only had the phone and this there for a few years back to back in this then will increase voter registration and better protect not that that by relying on documentation as much as possible I can AB are limit their rate of human error with the back and it give me the customer will present a document published and not their extension like a daca student or green card holder it's not a medically filter out a lot of voter registration that that person is not offered the opportunity to make a mistake that can have a catastrophic consequence I'm not a part of executives that the market is thank protect that that those from apple came in Eric and as much as possible after all this leaders will respectfully ask you support but it's still thank you thank you very much and is that Mr the LF as I understand it that Mr -- -- Riady is there for technical question Sir it is running you want to add before we go to other witnesses in support yes if I could just say -- good morning Care members my name is nearly brownie on the policy director at the center for security model actions yes to me it is a national non partisan campaign support states in making elections more secure acceptable efficiency I'm here in support of SB five eighty three which as mentioned upgrade California's automatic voter registration system to a back end system I don't use an organ in Colorado and several other states I went and looked at some of the benefits of back in AB are over California's current system first back and if you're registered more people I will roughly forty five percent of the and the customers are declining registration under California's current system declination rates for back in mailers in Colorado or one percent actually there are also help overruled better reflect California's diverse citizenry in Oregon back in AB are registered younger less white and lower income voters left out by traditional voter registration methods second back into your create more accurate registration records automatically updating Anderson information records at the DMV I can't registration records save time and money by preventing undeliverable mail including mail ballot and reducing time spent updating information polls third second AB are relied on existing data collection at the DMV provide a more efficient system already records the identity documents provided your life transaction back into your leverages existing data collection to streamline and improve the efficacy of motor voter for these reasons we respectfully ask your support SB five thank you I thank you very much the supporters time did go a little over will make sure that the opposition side has equal amount of time -- to provide their testimony so we

testimony minutes and fifteen seconds to provide that and we welcome you our great good morning I chaired the laser Care by turn Yeltsin another committee members on Rockwell Goldman chief public policy officer I've been away -- educational fun and I want to thank you for this opportunity to raise some questions about SB five eighty three I want to clarify that our organization neither supports nor opposes this legislation the where are not unofficial opposer we just would like to urge the committee to carefully examine certain questions we have about the legislation we also acknowledge and appreciate the leadership of senator Newman and all of the proponent of that the H. ID eighty three in working to make voter registration accessible to all Californians because we share that important call so the first question we have is whether the significant changes that SB five eighty three you would make the current new motor voter program in terms of making determinations about whether certain documents show citizenship are non citizenship will indeed be more protective than the current multi step Act has station process that is use our folks have talked about human error but when you have to design a new systems automated new system train people -- come up with a new way of doing things there are certainly also -- opportunities and -- possibilities of human error there so we question what kind of testing what kind of training -- what kind of are really serious quality assurance is going to be done in creating that the automated system that is going to -- you know use documents to determine Abu would automatically be put on the voter rolls I will also note that at this time you know California is facing some serious investments that I have to make the deal with cold at nineteen -- in terms of our housing education health payer economic development and employment opportunities and we question whether we are going to get an appreciable increase in voter registration from the investment that is going to be needed -- for -- the new system -- you know we know some other states have been sighted but these are state that have very different populations in California in terms of their diversity -- and -- we also wonder whether if indeed the issue of people declining to register in front and might be addressed by some kind of education or better clarification in the current system rather than putting all of these resources in a new automated or some other kind of system based on documents -- there are some other features of the proposed SB five eighty three system that we have questions about we put this into a letter -- for example it doesn't appear to capture up front the political party or vote by mail preference of the voters -- -- these people indicate those preferences would have to stand in and respond tool for that they get in the mail and -- we have seen at least in Oregon there's not always people who answer the question or send that form back -- and we have similar questions about the way that our language preference for voting material is collected in school you can ultimately that we very much respect and appreciate the commitment of senator Newman and SB five eighty three proponents Lake photo registration acceptable to all Californians Abu share that goal but we really also urge this committee to carefully examine the thank you and we have raised in our capital thank you thank you miss school for that

queued up at this time Mister chair okay very good we thank everyone for their patience and support and in opposition to this bill -- who of -- provided their testimony on our teleconference lines -- we are going to now bring the matter back to the committee for further discussion and quite -- and I will leave it off given the absence of some of my colleagues at the moment senator Newman thank you for of bringing this bill forward at the goals that you outline our goals that I'm a hundred percent embrace week you know we had an incredible turn out of -- -- voters in this last election and I think it's something of of great accomplishment in praise for all the folks that are involved in that the secretary of state in the registrar's often down the state of the we know and you have been quite clear that there are many others that might want to participate and we should do everything we can to make that as easy and as possible I think that's the goal that you've outlined in your bill -- and I fully support it the only thing that gives me some hesitancy -- in this matter is that -- that that the department of motor vehicles is not have a great track record -- unfortunately staff past and present -- in being able to take what are a thoughtful measures such as yours and making sure that they're implemented -- fairly and yet we we have seen that track record -- we also know that what you're asking for nay actually reduced -- -- personnel time -- and and create some efficiencies but it it comes as a requirement that the technology the technology has to be there your bill is going to be some improvements in that technology and once again unfortunately struggled in that space -- as well -- and so that that's the that's the thing that worries me I I was hopeful that we would have a representative from the department of motor vehicles here to provide their thoughts and their testimony and we have not had that we reached out to them as well -- Committee is reach out to them feedback on the operational side I was also hoping that we would have someone from the secretary of state's office here to participate in this conversation -- today because they are so important in making sure that we dot all the I's and cross all the keys to make sure that the good -- goals that you have outlined in your bill -- can be operational as well and unfortunately they have not come forward to provide their testimony we've reached out to the office and the great leadership the new leadership in that office -- by secretary of state Weber and I certainly there's a lot of start up -- obligations that I'm sure they're they're wrestling with and this is one of many things that that they have to focus on but we haven't benefitted from their their their input either and so that really is the heart of it for me is not the goals but the ability to operationalize in your bill -- the timeline that you've establishes pretty aggressive -- and so that's that's the part of it troubles me as I offer year irrigation on that that question -- if you would all right -- thank you Mister I I do appreciate the questions it particularly I think it's reasonable actually obvious -- to have concerns about DMV's prior track records relates to technology implementation I would point out that the DMV is -- apparently making progress -- over the last year or so under the governor's leadership -- taking some newer very urgent projects to solving some of the problems that come up but it but it you know the the proof is always in the doing with respect to the implementation of the technology we has a state will actually in this case have the benefit of the prior experience of some other states -- and and so I think we can call on states such as Colorado for some insight -- and and and learn from their experience but -- you know these things are obviously challenging -- and then again back to your point with respect to timeline state as I've made clear -- in working with all the different stakeholders we're open to it the the sponsor the bill or are open to appropriately amending those time lines to make sure that we don't get ahead of our skis as they say but all in I think it's fairly clear especially based on the experience of other states that this is a workable scenario it has the dual benefit of increasing the efficiency of the DMV -- but just in poorly actually more importantly Sir is that very admirable goal of engaging a larger share of the electorate when it comes to opting into voting -- in that will be to the good thank you for for sharing that I guess I don't two things one is is that you know that there have been successful tech technological improvements that state governments and other places and I'll put it on California is so big and so vast and the obligations or agencies -- so much more -- in the greater in scale that unfortunately even when we've seen successes and and the implementation of technology in other states -- it still has remained a big challenge here I think it's much for our size and complexity as as anything else I'm not certainly that the good work of up all of the consultants that getting gauged in these types of things and so and fortunately even the successes was you -- report still gives me concern okay at our elections have been incredibly well run -- that given the number of up of registered -- individuals -- you know it there is set so much praise and appreciation to our secretary of state current and former as well as the registrars across the state that have conducted these elections in an extraordinarily effective and honest way you're when you have twenty million people voting that there's still going to be some concerns and problems and so yes as we look at the landscape you know we do see some examples of where someone might have received a second ballot -- and and and there are little things and I I stress how little they are in the context of all that's going on in our elections process where -- inadvertent mistakes have occurred and they raise questions and with it makes all of us uncomfortable when those questions are raised even as in as infinitesimally small as they may be and so and the reason that gives us concerns is because the integrity of our election process is foundational to our entire democracy we need people to have confidence that -- everything that we do in regard to a voter exercising their choice is done above board transparent and -- and fair I I know it's the same goals you have we all have because it's so important to our our governmental system that we have and so once again while I share the goals that you have laid out in your bill it is the confidence level that I think we must have -- that is B. as gives me pause in regard to this bill now I appreciate this is the first hearing and a lot of opportunities going forward for user and you know that your great leadership to work through these questions we hope that DMV and the secretary of state -- and other stakeholders will engage more thoroughly as the bill gets vetted but I would ask you to arrive at it as this bill moves forward and -- and I'm willing to support it to move forward that I ask you to -- to stay connected to our committee to stay connected to me and to give me some confidence going forward that that that check and will enable us to if necessary caught I don't call for applause if it's necessary if these questions have been the result I know you want to resolve them to and you're very committed to having this not just be implemented but to work he wanted to work has your name on it you wanted to have pride and how it's been done but I would ask you to give me a little more confidence and assurance that that that this committee will have that opportunity to join you -- in that level of confidence all right with that at any other members have any questions or comments enter Newman to go back to you for clothes and perhaps you can address those those issues in your clients I I'd be glad to Mister so so I I do appreciate your concerns I I actually share your concerns -- I will wholeheartedly committed to working with this committee but be you again working with all stakeholders it did these are not simple questions to solve your is Forest -- these kinds of implementations I do think it's worthy of I would also point out that in addition to the DMV's recent progress that we as a state or the the the the beneficiaries of a whole bunch of really impressive progress when it got at the Secretary state level -- in coordination with all of the County registration moving to the state wide voter registration database which was no small thing in its own right so we have in the sector states office a willing partner -- a gan we have -- but I think some good experience drawn from other states that is relevant -- not withstanding California size but to your point its original purpose to implement a system that does not work where that works worse than its predecessor and so I I share your concern I will fully commit -- to work with all stakeholders moving forward and pulling The bill back if necessary if we don't have your insurance that we can make that promise so with that I asked respectfully for an aye vote today so just to clarify if you feel that this committee feels that as the bill moves forward it hasn't been put in that that shape to have that confidence on the operational side that you will bring it back to this committee for further discussion to be clear I would have been make the commitment to reflect okay -- any other comments or questions for members -- we are on SB five eighty three over still there okay okay so we have had a close and I'm now looking for a motion on this bill -- also moved okay the Senate Health we have center Leyva has -- stepped up in and made a motion to -- to -- this would be a do pass but first to be referred to the committee on rules as I understand it as the status so indicate so with that we do have a motion to pass first referred referred to the committee on rules of the consulting with take the role SB five eight three the motion is due passed the first be referred to the committee on rules Glazer aye Glazer aye Nielsen Hertzberg Leyva aye waiver aye Newman all right Newman all right okay that the bill enjoys that the support of three members we have to absent and we'll wait to level for the long call and wait for them to join us later this morning okay so we are going to move on now to SB six six zero for those people paying attention at home -- this is six six zero we have one more bill by senator Newman after that which is six six three but we're going to focus right now on this bill SB six six zero senator Newman we welcome you back to our community and we would welcome your testimony on this bill Mr sure it's good to be back I feel like I was never way -- and and I have the this is a mixed blessing today of having for bills some of which have the same digits so the last one had a three and it would seem to get too confusing because this has to six is -- but this bill is S. B. six six zero -- and -- it is very different than the bill that will follow six X. three Mister Sanders I am here before today advocating on behalf of SB six six zero under its provisions by eliminating common practices in gathering signatures for ballot measures which incentivize the willful deception of voters SB six six year will will make necessary important steps towards safeguarding the integrity of California's initiative referendum and recall process sees California's one of a number of states whose constitutions expressly provided citizens with tools to directly redress abuses of government or malfeasance by public officials in the form of the initiative the referendum in the recall first some historical background and context if you may be aware these admirable and useful constitution director Marcus you provisions date back more than a century and are the result of the efforts of a group of progressive reformers led by then governor Hiram Johnson who then went on to become California's longest serving represented the United States Senate until -- with twenty eight years in office until recently being eclipsed by our own senator Dianne Feinstein as a result of the heroic efforts of governor Johnson and his supporters California's constitution through the initial referendum a recall makes explicit provisions that allow for the citizenry to take actions outside of the normal legislative process in order to enact repeal legislation or to remove a corrupt or malfeasance elected official from office but let me point out before I get into the meat of this this bill and its provisions have nothing whatsoever to do with the current effort to recall are sitting governor that has no urgency provision have no impact at all on that process let me go back to built to the original framers way of thinking the initiative referendum and recall represented a means for the little guy to chief directorate of and reformist actions that elected invested interest might otherwise thwart because the framers of the initial referendum a recall regarding these processes as populist actions of last resort they deliberately provided that in order to qualify for the ballot the proponents of any of these direct to the voters plebiscites would first be required to gather a sufficient number of voter signatures to validate the legitimacy and popular support for such an action over the years and especially in recent decades however something very different than the framers intent has transpired these tools are Director moxie have been effectively co opted by the very money interest they were originally created to offset as these well funded groups with it increasingly explicit self interested motivations have become ever more adept at using the initiative referendum and recall process he's to their benefit something of an arms race around the processes has ensued especially as it pertains to signature gathering at the center of these efforts the small number of specialized firms with expertise in signature gathering have risen to the fore offering their services to proponents seeking to place a measure on the ballot and any given time one of the principal tactics used by the specialized things are getting firms is the deployment of well trained professional signature gatherers typically the signature gathers are paid on a per signature or commission basis also known as a bounty at a rate determined by the market as it is assessed at that time depending on the nature of the initiative The characterised of the district the time of year or competition with other nations either within the state or in other states at that time the cost procedure can vary widely from as low as two dollars per signature gathered to as high as twenty dollars in some cases and because bounty paid signatures are incentivized to optimize their yield based on how rapidly they can secure signatures from voters they frequently traffic and misdirection misleading information and outright falsehoods in order to reduce as many voters as possible to sign in the minimum out of time thereby increasing their yield against this backdrop the determining factor getting a measure on the ballot too often has less to do with its policy merits then the depth of it's promote proponents pockets of course this is exactly the opposite of what the framers originally had in mind as the direct result of these perverse incentives the paper signature system has subverted the original idealistic content of California's founders who envisioned a people powered system of referenda in propositions validated by demonstrated public support and would succeed or fail on their merits not on what how well the system can be gamed the initiative referendum and recall processes can and should play an important value role in California politics and government this coming from somebody who has been recall it has become clear however that under the current system driven by persons you're bounties there are scant prospects for to turn bad actors who willfully mislead voters at the expense of the integrity of the electoral process SB six sixty addresses this issue by prohibiting the practice of paying signature gatherers on a personal basis when collecting signatures to place a state or local initiative referendum or recall on the ballot this measure aye I should be clear would not prohibit payment for signature gathering that is not based on the number of signatures obtained Shigure gathers still could be paid an hourly wage or salary as the proponents see fit this bill will provide assurance and transparency to the voters and it's enforcement provisions will permit both the Attorney General and any person to bring a civil claim under this section for procedure payment practices employers which is to say those who employs signature gathers who violate the provisions of SB six sixty would be subject to a fine of twenty five thousand dollars or fifty dollars per signature fraudulent gathered whichever amount is greater if that is proving this good government measure will serve to strengthen a recall referendum and issue processes by ensuring that voters are aware of exactly what they're signing and are not being deceived ultimately SB six sixty will help to restore faith in our elections and our nation processes other states such as Colorado Montana and Oregon have already examined the issues surrounding facing she gathers and of adopted legislation prohibiting procedure about two payments require that payment fishing together make may only be made on an hourly or a salary based it is time for California to do the same our democracy and our governments and our politics will be the better for it I respectfully ask for your aye vote today thank U.

N. N. A. center gathers relationship to their employer I think that's a very separate set of questions as it relates to -- independent contracting what we are trying to do is to remove the incentive to expedite the gathered signatures at the expense of the truth -- and I think in particular and local initiatives that are funded by outside groups that is a common observation that professional signature gathers in in sort of their diligent work to maximize their hourly return are sometimes less than ethical less than clear in the representations there's nothing about this bill that would prevent a signature gathering operation from paying the people who they've engaged to collect signatures important to note that having said that -- what we want in our initiative process is the assurance that if and when a measure reaches the threshold to qualify for the ballot that that that is done honestly and in so doing that represents the sentiment the true sentiment of the voters I and as such it does the work that the framers intended which is to validate the the legitimacy -- and the import of the the action being taken those things that run counter to that -- tend to corrode our faith in these processes -- and so that's my goal here is not to restrict in any way -- the public or any particular groups right to exercise -- these tools but to ensure when they are employed -- that the public in each voter that is campus has the assurance that they're participating in an honest open and ethical process that's to the good for our our state for our democracy for a politics implemented laws very similar to this again it does not prevent signature gathers from being pages not prevent groups from paying their signature gathers what it does do is is align incentives with ethical behavior -- and with that I respectfully ask your aye vote today thank you senator Newman -- I've appreciated the conversations that we've had and certainly -- going through what you have gone through I appreciate -- how -- it important the integrity of this process says and I know that we're going to hear another bill in a few minutes about the recall petition -- which I think for me at least is headed and they were in the right direction for trying to deal with that some of the concerns that you raise and none of us want to see this representation least it we assume that per provisions that are in our laws that that -- allow for someone to be prosecuted for for Mississippi and misleading and what they do and the dilemma for me is that while we share the same aims -- I I think that at the end of the day that the this measure is going to raise the cost and create greater barriers to qualify measures and that I think that's why that's why three previous governors at that cited to veto similar bills to this and -- also the the fact that there's a private right of action here creates a lot of concern for me of creating a an incentive on the opposite side someone who sees a personal profit to -- to prosecute cases that would be allowed under this bill also for me as troubling and and Y. reluctantly I'm not gonna be able to support it today -- but I appreciate all the good work that you have put in this area and I know and a moment we're going to hear another bill that I think it tries to advance some of the goals that you have to establish I do know that members are in other committees with other obligations and so I guess what I would ask is to hold this -- as we wait for other members to join and we'll see if there's a motion to -- to advance this -- in a few minutes okay with that certainly anything you wanna St close when I make sure you get that opportunity I I want to just touch on on your point regarding the private right of action -- and yeah you know I appreciate the kind of the red flag that that tends to rage at but I will say in not just my experience but the experience of of of of many recall efforts at where a patient you guys might not have been -- you know so fully ethical there is a dilemma and it's it's already as you I think alluded to it's already expressly illegal to to intention mislead a voter as to the nature intent of issues you're getting process but as it turns out there's there's virtually no possibility of enforcement -- as a practical matter -- day in it you know it's not surprising when you think about it so we give great latitude free speech I in the conduct of politics the problem more importantly most of those who would be that particular statute are themselves political actors are themselves subject to elections I and so they're they're very disinclined to take steps even when -- sort of important to do so -- and so the you know so that's the basis for that effort but they're also problems with admissibility of evidence that as it turns out you you could if you recorded a signature gather on on your cell phone -- making a clear reference misrepresentation that evidence indicate Uniserve standard coffee prices would not be admissible in court I into it creates a catch twenty two where if you know practitioners of six you got and are willing to bend the law there's very little recourse under current law despite the nominal -- probation on the misdemeanor penalty so it so that's the basis for that -- again to be clear -- you know these are all very useful tools what we're trying to do is to strengthen them -- and into your your concern I think it's it's a it's a concern shared by others as to whether not this might raise the cost of of -- do you know serve these sorts of efforts -- I'm not sure that's clear -- but I would say that that we do want the assurance that that people participating in these clips across these are properly -- work for instance -- trying to serious popular support that would be a kind of any material can concerns right because you would have no shortage of you know volunteers Energy we've seen that quite recently -- but in those cases where there's a used a moneyed interest it actually works completely in their favor -- and and against perhaps in some cases the interest of other less -- you know Shiv -- well endowed I constituencies because if you have six million dollars or let's go the other way if you have an initiative you want to bring to the ballot -- and you talk to a a signature gathering firm they tell you what the going price might be and say you need to gather the million six of signatures and it's it's it's they give the going rate is five dollars for a signature well you know progress eight million dollars if you have a million dollars it's basically a done deal right would you know that the market when working officially you'll get those strangers if you can pay for them in in many cases that you don't even have to do it -- as we are taking to the recent bill and privacy simply the threat to do so it's enough to compel the Legislature into action and compromised that's clearly counter to what the original framers intended by way of these tools so that you know there's there's always another side but I wanted in this case that this is all on balance to the good -- and my hope is that it will be support today that thank you senator Newman and I think you make a very good point -- in regard to the enforcement question and it goes beyond this issue two other issues of -- of where we put private right of action and other places in our in our codes -- because of a lack of confidence that our public law enforcement community which were has direct line responsibility and as proposed in your bill and other places -- have not stepped up as they should and he raise a number of issues that I think are legitimate -- issues in that space and I wanna I wanna make knowledge that I would note that -- the petition process is simply one part of the -- if you will action process that the end of the day the voters -- if L. one was successful -- would still have to provide their judgment and that we do know that you know how the money can influence that process to I guess I have from my own experience I would say that if you have a a a and a deep pocket financial interests that they're gonna be a lot easier for them to pay someone that versus for the signature than some other interest that maybe not as as well funded I appreciate that there can be reasonable -- the people on all sides of that question it's not an easy one to unnecessarily prudent -- certainly it it's at the heart of the that you feel is the disincentive for things to be done right and I appreciate that and -- and appreciate the expertise he experiences that you have that are -- that deep and meaningful and I think -- -- provide your leadership in this space and I admired and respected okay with that without that scene if there's any other colleagues who wish to make a comment about this I don't see any hands going up I think we're going to do on this is just a for it for a few minutes to wait for members to come back into Committee and see where they want to they want to take it all right so with that we're just gonna put that one on hold that was SB six six zero on our agenda item number six hi this is a legislation by a friend of this committee senator Newman -- and it is a different numbers of those who are paying attention please do so now this is SB six six three is a lot of excitement early in the hearing and this may be a moment to -- to step up and and share your views on that as we hear this bill so senate-room and we welcome your comments on SB six six three thank you Mister chair -- I diss the bill the S. B. six six three which apparently has instigated so much interest advocate on its behalf SB six six three will protect the integrity California's current constitution able processes for recalling a state elected space sitting alike that official by addressing a deterring unethical practices in the collection of signatures toward qualifying the recall effort by allowing the target of that ever the opportunity to communicate directly with voters whose signatures may have been fraudulently or misleadingly secured as part of an effort as noted in my earlier testimony California is one of a number of states whose constitutions express revived the public to have recourse to directly redress abuse of government or malfeasance by public officials in the form of the initiative the referendum in the recall this bills deal specifically and exclusively with the recall process and I will point out at the outset this bill has no urgency provision if signed into law it will not go into effect until next year as such it will have no impact whatsoever on the current recall effort against governor Newsom voters signed petitions protecting the high traffic locations were professional singers together set up rarely take the time to read the actual text of a petition instead rely quite often upon the representations of the signature gatherers this means you surgery gathers often operate without any sort of transparency routinely and systematically misleading voters about not only the rationale but the process and with little if any concern about legal repercussions the current law allows for voters to withdraw their signatures from recall petition the success withdrawal seizures is for all intents and purposes largely impossible for most voters for two primary reasons first request for signature withdrawals must be received by elections officials before the signature is submitted to election officials for validation yet the voter is rarely if ever aware of when the petition signatures will be submitted as and they are often done on a rolling basis second once a recall petition has been signed in process to voter has no practical way of finding out whether he or she might have been deceived into signing a petition because no one other than elections officials not even the target of a recall effort is currently permitted under existing law to inspect the signatures or the names on a particular petition as a consequence the target recall even where there is clear evidence of unethical activity in the collection of those signatures is it an immense an unfair disadvantage in trying to offset that effort and to prevent the proponents of the of the opportunity to reach the prescribed number of qualifying signatures by canvassing petition signers and asking them to rescind their signatures from particular recall petitions if they have been misinformed SB six six three would provide the target recall petition the very very closely circumcised opportunity to examine submitted signatures while the liberal establishing guardrails around how the target recall may use information obtained for the petition transparency measure adopted through this bill As sharpened by the amendments proposed by committee staff under the transit SB six six three the target of a recall effort will be limited to using petitions singer information only to win sure the voters understood the petition when they signed it and doing the support the goals of the petition if orders include they've been deceived into signing SB six six three that provides a pathway and a time line to assist voters in withdrawing their signatures the opposition will assert that making the allowance for the target of a recall effort to counter petition those who assigned to somehow and violation of the signers privacy and would leave them vulnerable to ration and retaliation not only do the amendments and other provisions ensure that this won't happen it's also true that the overall rationale the original restaurant rationale for restricting access to reap recall petition actually had nothing to do with insulating a target from its target rather these provisions were intended to prevent subsequent misuse of the petition and its information by others whose aims were unrelated to the original effort under the logic of the framers of California's recall process and ever to remove a sitting elected official to recall was meant to be something of a trial by ballot if you will it is a fundamental tenet of the American justice system that the accused should always have the right to face his or her accusers this is what we're endeavoring to do nothing more nothing less than that to that end California petition process should be respected honest and provide voters with confidence that their seizures do not result from nor contribute to the misrepresentation distortion of the basis on which the recall from office is currently being sought if the means by which features a collective qualifying are less than ethical it undermines the validity of the recall effort and brings into question the value of the signatures gathered in the conduct of that effort providing the target of the recall with the opportunity to communicate with petition signers seem reasonable and fair while respecting and protecting the signers including for retaliation and that's more than just by considering the serious implications of a recall effort I would like to thank the committee Ste you with my staff to draft amendments to protect the privacy of signers and defined the terms on which these sorts of process will take place with that would also prohibit disclosure of personal information a prior require of ages and expressly prohibit any kind of retaliation by the target of a recall I am respected X. respectfully asking for an aye vote today -- and let me once again say because I think it's necessary given kind of the nature of the interest in this bill This bill anomaly has nothing to do with the current effort directed against our governor I will also say this bill is not to be relevant to those efforts aye aye will accord effort all the respect is due because they have been nothing if not direct and honest with the people of California anybody who is signed it their petition probably has a very clear understanding as to what they're asking and why and in this case did not to take the role of the aims of my bill my bill actually it's good aspires to address the other scenario in which the terms recall are not properly represented to the signers -- and as such the target recall should have recourse to at least ascertain whether not voters understood what they were signing particularly given the eight the implications to that elected officials career and the relationship to the voters thank you Mr Jerry good thank you senator Newman as I understand it we don't have lead witnesses in support or in opposition so will allow some discretion at the start to -- -- for both sides to have -- those individuals who are speaking to provide a little bit more context to their opinions and their position so

name and understand that it's collectively three minutes so Sir your you're welcome to come on up and share your thoughts thank you thank you Mister chairman honorable senators and Mister Newman aye okay I'm take I am -- or and Heatley I am a resident of Sacramento county and I am in strong opposition to this bill for many reasons I am the lead proponent for the largest ever attempted petition drive in our nation's history okay and I worked the streets I gathered signatures I talked were afraid to participate and the petition gathering process because they were afraid their personal private information would be disclosed to the target and self and they actually would walk away from the tables -- and turn away from participating in the lawful peaceful petition gathering process their first amendment right because they're afraid of retaliation and retribution this is a dangerous and reckless bill that would give the target of a recall access to all of that data all that personal information and it would stifle the process that the constitutional process that people are guaranteed it would disenfranchise the voters of the state and -- it would basically just notify the petition gathering process for recalls as a whole so there's there's a reason that California constitution section seven article two says that voting has to be secret okay and you know why it has to be secret because you don't want to allow undue influence on the population with the with the political figures right and then -- you have -- government code sixty five three that says that signatures need to be private kept private on the petition gathering process even I can't look at signatures after they've been put on the petition okay those are taken away and this bill would open up the signatures and the personal information for the people that signed it to a third party because just the target isn't the only one who's gonna be looking at this data and information they're gonna have an entire crew if you're gonna campus over two million signatures then there's an entire crew and the likelihood of that information being leaked out business owners and you know personal information things like that being leaked out into the public it just expands that danger it's reckless and it's a dangerous bill and Mister Newman I would personally requested to withdraw very good thank you Sir

Gallagher Sacramento county aye opposed to opposition SB six six three thank you so much and -- moderator again thank you for your wonderful patients as we do our work here today I want to thank all those who of of come forward to testify in support and in opposition to this bill -- appreciate everyone's patience as we try to do our work we try to do it in a fair and balanced way hope you appreciate that we are trying to ensure that we get as much -- information and testimonies we can as we hear this bill okay so with that we're going to close the public testimony portion of the hearing and go to my colleagues on the panel for any questions or comments Center Leyva thank you Mr thank you Mister chair I'm appreciate all of the -- testimony in opposition I heard know that there are concerns over privacy but I have to say is someone who has participated in signature gathering for thirty years prior to running for office -- everyone who testified against the bill may have pure intentions but I can tell you that most of the people that I have encountered in those thirty years did not have pure intentions and -- in some cases well I mean I let's just say it when when the you recall the Mister Newman and we were when I was knocking on doors and people said I didn't know what I was signing people lie to me people told me it was about something else I mean it does happen all the time -- so I support the bill I appreciate you bring it forward and I appreciate the amendments that you took in order to help make it a little more a little cleaner a little more straight forward and hopefully people for a little more comfortable with it but obviously for the bill now moves that when it's appropriate thank you center Leyva any other comments or questions from committee members all right we're gonna and then now bring it back to center Newman would you like to close I do appreciate the concerns articulated by the witnesses not just here but -- on the phone as well -- and I want to speak a little bit of this notion of privacy rights so the the ballot in America is secret -- and that is kind of a hallowed sacred tradition but participation in politics is not intended to be secret or anonymous and again and to the intent and thinking of the original framers of these measures clearly I mean that was a different time and place the only senator Nielsen was alive at that time I'm kidding Jim but but it's it's -- what we're trying to do here is to create effective deterrence as much as anything right to center lowest point and into my early point I mean I cannot I will accord the proponents of this current recall effort for the full respect the date that you have been nothing if not honest and straight forward with your with your issue with the folks who had who US to sign and you know we have worked with the committee staff and they've actually been be extremely thorough on the the types of amendments taken in the can of the forms as a manage would take I and I'm gonna run down the list really quickly right and it's it's to provide exactly the assurance that I think you're seeking I on the one hand work which we exempts small jurisdictions if the recall target represents a a a community of of the fewer than fifty thousand registered voter that's not population that voters so it's obviously much larger out we want to make sure that that that that's a small town -- that's where people might know each other might be subject to the kinds of retaliation I think if you're concerned about -- and so we've created a line to exempt -- did it communities below a certain size we we we will not let people see the signatures right we do you know what to do we respect a person identified information prevent identity fraud it The bill prohibits disclosure -- it prohibits the trying to recall the represents from sharing that petitioners goes in the name of a signer it includes a number of other recall petition list protections -- and I won't go them to now it requires the use pledge by a recall target to submit in writing -- upon a penalty of a misdemeanor that information in any form and again I can I give the committee credit for working to live really to create the kinds assurances that I think people are speaking to but then again I will come back to this notion that you know politics and and you know public debate is is inherently Public and that's not a bad thing I also point out that is that -- what for the most part you know there is this is sort of a paradox here that -- you you the the insurance of anonymity privacy when in fact that many of the same people are Kinks dreamily active on social media -- and extremely public -- and so I would point out that if the government California were interested in retaliating he be doing so right now it's not that hard to find -- the you know the proponents the active supporters of this measure and so again what we're trying to do is to to create a deterrent structure so that in the event of a recall effort there is an incentive to act honorably I even if that that conversation is uncomfortable right because the you know the can that's in the nature of our politics not everything's competently given how divided our culture society and our state is today so having said that I am glad to work with stakeholders here or provisions that you think address your needs please bring them to me -- because again what I'm trying to do is not to stop recalls not to -- inhibit public debate but to ensure that these things are done honestly and with integrity moving forward so with that Mister chair I asked when I go to that thank you senator Newman center Leyva has an additional question -- point to make think thank you sorry about that -- when you were talking about people being very forthright and honest -- with this recall maybe all of you in here have been those of you who identified herself as part of the recall I just want to say that my personal experience was different from that when the recall first started prior to the pandemic UP I approached a couple of different folks that were gathering signatures and the line that they were using is that Gavin Newsom had raise the gas tax and I said you know that's not accurate I said because I was here when governor brown was the one who signed that into law so I just your point senator Newman people are not always honest and what I said is you can you can find this for make sure you know why you're signing he did not raise the gas tax that was the difference governor thank you thank you I center Leyva let me let me just say -- senator Newman I want to thank you for that the work that you've done with my committee staff and with me on this bill -- as you know I haven't been a big fan of this guy scheme that's kind of been in line places that we have today but I think what you're doing and the amendments that you've taken have really gone a long way to -- dealing with a lot of the concerns that I had certainly as it relates to privacy and you went through a number of those -- in detail so I won't repeat them -- but they're significant and I think that it gives a confidence anyone signing up a petition that their name will not be abused -- as it we have similar rules in place rather -- signatures that are gathered in in in a similar fashion let me also mention that one of the things you didn't know was another amendment that you took -- which that -- in and under current law when you -- advance a petition to remove someone -- that there is no highlights to -- anything that you're doing on that petition it simply as a paragraph it's all jumbled together and -- it's very difficult for anybody being asked to sign it would understand with clarity what that petition really intends to do and it goes to senator you know what am I signing what is it really do it -- the -- barking from the petition as signature gather it may not be my nay not match up with what exactly they're putting before that voter and you've taken an amendment to make it clear at the top of every page -- that that person that is being requested to be recall I think that's a significant amount as well and for those reasons it's and it's for those reasons that I'm at -- going to support your your bill today so we we have -- we've gone through the committee process in an orderly and fair way -- here -- in the capital as we do on all bills and so we've gone through that process of public testimony time I'm gonna bring the matter up again back to the committee we're looking for a motion here I think senator Leyva has asked it to be recognized at this point in the proceedings this bill do passed but first re refer to the committee on judiciary I'm saying that correctly yeah so we have a motion before the committee and will ask the consultant to please take the role SB six six three the motion is to pass the first be referred to the committee on judiciary Glazer hi there are you also Nielsen no Hertzberg Leyva five Riverside Newman aye Newman aye okay so that's a bill currently has enough votes to get apple we're gonna put it on call for an absent member all right so we have a lot of -- they just review our situation we have one final bill on the docket on call and one bill that hasn't that received a motion yet that still entertain one I'm gonna turn the gavel over to my wonderful vice chair senator Nielsen so -- we can proceed with the agenda perfect ready to present Mister chairman I am ready refocusing our this is SB six eight six -- that's what the is before the committee and what I'm presenting it would provide greater transparency and disclosure for limited liability companies that make political contributions -- as they're known L. L. C.'s have a limited existing public disclosure requirements under the political Reform Act in other existing laws they are unlike corporations that have existing filing requirements in two thousand nineteen a fair political practices commission enforcement division examination of L. L. C.'s found that it was relatively easy to find information about in L. L. C.'s type of business it's address and its agents for services up process however it was extremely difficult and many times impossible to identify in L. L. C.'s owner or the true source of funds for an L. L. C.'s political expenditures SB six eight six six to provide the public with additional information on L. L. C.'s that make campaign contributions specifically this bill would require L. L. C.'s to submit to the secretary of state upon qualifying as a committee a list of members who either have a membership interest in the L. L. C. of at least ten percent or made a cumulative capital contribution of at least a thousand dollars secondly it codifies existing F. PPC regulations focusing on reporting requirements for L. L. C.'s and requiring the disclosure of the person responsible for the L. L. C.'s political activity SB six eight six is sponsored by the fair political practices commission on the line to speak in support and answering technical questions as Lindsay Mecano with the F. PPC Californians deserve to know who's trying to influence the political process this bill is a simple yet meaningful approach to provide clarity regarding political contributions and aims to disclose the true source of funds used by L. L. C.'s and with that I respectfully ask for your aye vote thank you Mr chairman do we have anyone here in the room to testify Mister chairman we had a a a a lead supporter online Lindsay the kind of with the F. PPC and -- she's in the room or on the telephone lines good faith but she has not on the line okay please would you proceed then with your testimony in support thank you good morning Mister chair and senators my name is Lindsay McConnell and I am Legislative Council for the fair political practices commission the FCC is the state commission that administers and enforces the political Reform Act which regulates campaign financing conflict of interest lobbying and governmental ethics commission is pleased to offer the very important bill over the last couple years the FTTC headcount increasing instances out these being used as a vehicle for dark money in state and local elections under existing law LLCs can be formed quickly and relatively anonymously and to make critical contributions in after and there's usually no way for the public to find out who's actually funding the contribution The goal of SB six eight thank is to address the lack of transparency I setting like on the true source of funds used by LP's that spend money on political activity in the state I required this closure of certain members of the LLC or other words disclosure of his fund is the out of in order to come to a well thought out and down policy The Commission researched and considered a number of approaches including the approach taken by the state of New York which requires an L. L. C. that makes a political contribution or expenditure in any amounts the following statement of identity that difficult to every member of the Alfie SB six it is a narrower The New York prosje and requires the statement of members only if the L. L. C. reaches a threshold level of physical activity that would already under current law subject the out of the regulation under the political Reform Act as a committee or committee sponsor SB six eight six also requires disclosure of not every member of the Alfie rather only those who have a ten percent or greater membership interest or have made a cap cumulative capital contribution to the L. three thousand dollars or more within a specified period SB six eight would also codify Chiu recent regulations that increase the information available about Alfie expense money on political activity in the state is regulations are important steps increasing transparency in this area for a loan do not give the public information about the true source of funds which is why this bill is crucial original purposes of the political Reform Act was to establish strong disclosure laws the public is informed about the people interests who are funding campaigns in the state L. L. C. should not be a vehicle for concealing identities are skirting contribution limits are requiring disclosure of an L. L. C.'s funders when it thank money for political purposes SB six eight six strengthened the state campaign disclosure lock insures that the public has the information that they need to make informed decisions thank you to the committee and senators thank you the league of women voters of California for their support and thank you center Glazer for your leadership on this important subject thank
