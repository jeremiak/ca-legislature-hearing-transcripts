00:37:56.107 --> 00:37:58.709
RACIAL.

00:37:58.776 --> 00:38:00.444
I EQUATE THE RATIOS TO SPEAK.

00:38:00.511 --> 00:38:02.680
IF WE DON'T HAVE PENALTIES FOR

00:38:02.747 --> 00:38:04.582
VIOLATING SPEED LIMITS DRIVERS

00:38:04.649 --> 00:38:05.650
WOULD HAVE NO INCENTIVE TO

00:38:05.716 --> 00:38:07.685
FOLLOW THEM.

00:38:07.752 --> 00:38:08.986
AND THEN THEY'LL CONTINUE TO

00:38:09.053 --> 00:38:11.622
SPEED UNTIL ONE DAY SOMEONE GETS

00:38:11.689 --> 00:38:14.191
INJURED OR WORSE DICE.

00:38:14.258 --> 00:38:15.593
SO IF WE HAVE SPEEDING LAWS WHEN

00:38:15.660 --> 00:38:16.827
FORCE BUT MECHANISMS THAT

00:38:16.894 --> 00:38:18.229
PROTECT THE PUBLIC AGAINST

00:38:18.295 --> 00:38:19.530
RECKLESS DRIVERS.

00:38:19.597 --> 00:38:20.665

HOLD HOSPITALS ACCOUNTABLE FOR

00:38:22.366 --> 00:38:24.035

KNOWN AS PLANS OF CORRECTION.

00:38:42.820 --> 00:38:44.655
SURPRISINGLY THERE IS NO LIMIT

00:38:44.722 --> 00:38:46.724
ON HOW MANY PLANS OF CORRECTION

00:38:46.791 --> 00:38:48.726

POTENTIALLY AFFECT THEIR OUTCOME.

00:42:10.895 --> 00:42:12.730
THIS IS ALSO THE SAME SENTIMENT

00:42:12.796 --> 00:42:14.365

FACE SITUATIONS THAT MAKE IT

00:42:17.534 --> 00:42:19.904
DIFFICULT FOR US TO SPEND TIME

00:42:19.970 --> 00:42:21.272
WITH THEIR PATIENTS DUE TO THE

00:42:21.338 --> 00:42:22.706
HOSPITAL'S UNDERSTAFFED BEING.

00:42:22.773 --> 00:42:24.441
LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE WE

00:42:24.508 --> 00:42:26.076

00:42:26.143 --> 00:42:27.912
OF TWO PATIENTS PER NURSE OR

00:42:27.978 --> 00:42:29.246
EVEN ONE PATIENT PER NURSE A

00:42:30.581 --> 00:42:31.448
ILLNESS.

00:42:31.515 --> 00:42:33.984
BUT ALMOST EVERY DAY WE STRUGGLE

00:42:34.051 --> 00:42:35.886
TO HAVE THE PROMISED BREAK OF

00:42:35.953 --> 00:42:37.788
THIRTY MINUTES AND TWO TEN

00:42:37.855 --> 00:42:39.690

00:42:44.962 --> 00:42:45.729
PATIENTS WHILE THE OTHER NURSE

00:42:45.796 --> 00:42:48.165
GOES TO THEIR BREAK IN ADDITION

00:42:48.232 --> 00:42:49.867
THERE ARE SITUATIONS.

00:42:49.934 --> 00:42:51.335
WHERE A NURSE WILL COVER TO

00:42:51.402 --> 00:42:54.438
NURSES MEANING FOR PATIENTS SO

00:42:54.505 --> 00:42:55.639

REVIEWING THE AMENDMENTS HOWEVER --

ALL TIMES BECAUSE IT'S BASED ON

00:46:02.426 --> 00:46:03.694
THE PATIENTS ACUITY.

00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:05.262

THE REQUIREMENTS -- THERE ARE

00:46:13.036 --> 00:46:15.172
TIMES WHEN WE'RE STRUGGLING TO

00:46:15.239 --> 00:46:17.541
GET THERE AT ALL TIMES BUT WE

00:46:17.608 --> 00:46:20.277
PUT THE PATIENT FIRST -- AS OUR

00:46:20.344 --> 00:46:22.980
NURSES DO AS WELL -- ARE NURSES

00:46:23.046 --> 00:46:25.048
TO CALL IN SICK WE HAVE ABOUT A

00:46:25.115 --> 00:46:26.683
ONE IN FIVE TWO ONE IN FOR

00:46:26.750 --> 00:46:28.152
INSTANCE WHETHER COLIN SICK AND

00:46:28.218 --> 00:46:30.087
WE DO HAVE FLOW POOLS AND ACTION

00:46:30.154 --> 00:46:32.089
NURSES AND BREAK NURSES.

00:46:32.156 --> 00:46:33.590
AND THEY'RE STILL SITUATIONS

00:46:33.657 --> 00:46:35.726
WHERE -- WE MAY FIND OURSELVES

00:46:35.792 --> 00:46:37.594
OUT OF RATIO IN AN EFFORT TO PUT

00:46:37.661 --> 00:46:39.563
A PATIENT FIRST WE MAY NOT BE

00:46:39.630 --> 00:46:41.565
ABLE TO GET A BREAK -- IN SOME

00:46:41.632 --> 00:46:44.568
CIRCUMSTANCES EVEN WITH THE

00:46:44.635 --> 00:46:46.970
VARIOUS BACKUP POOLS ARE

00:46:47.037 --> 00:46:48.772
HOSPITALS EMPLOY.

00:46:48.839 --> 00:46:50.774
I'M WHEN WE LOOK AT THE BILL AND

00:46:50.841 --> 00:46:52.943
NOW THE ANALYSIS STATED -- OVER

00:46:53.010 --> 00:46:55.712
THE LAST TEN YEARS CD PH HAS --

00:46:55.779 --> 00:46:58.048
HAD WHAT ABOUT 1% OR LESS THAN

00:46:58.115 --> 00:46:59.816
1% OF VIOLATIONS WE THINK ABOUT

00:46:59.883 --> 00:47:01.752
THE THIRTY FIVE MILLION HOURS

00:47:01.818 --> 00:47:03.587
THAT HAVE BEEN WORKED OVER THE

00:47:03.654 --> 00:47:05.656
LAST TEN YEARS -- BUT WE ARE

00:47:05.722 --> 00:47:07.491
LOOKING AT THIS BILL -- AND THE

00:47:07.558 --> 00:47:08.892
AMENDMENT OFFERED BY THE

00:47:08.959 --> 00:47:10.694
COMMITTEE -- TO SEE IF THEY

00:47:10.761 --> 00:47:12.396
ADDRESS THE DYNAMIC SITUATIONS

00:47:12.462 --> 00:47:16.833
WE'VE BEEN TALKING THROUGH -- I

00:47:16.900 --> 00:47:19.269
THINK OUR CONCERN IS IS THAT --

00:47:19.336 --> 00:47:20.537
HOUSE WE PUT THE PATIENTS FIRST

00:47:20.604 --> 00:47:21.672
AND HOURS ARE HOSPITAL'S WORK IN

00:47:21.738 --> 00:47:23.540
GOOD FAITH -- TO DO THAT THAT

00:47:23.607 --> 00:47:26.109
THEY'RE NOT IN TURN PENALIZED AT

00:47:26.176 --> 00:47:29.279
RATES THAT ARE SIMILAR TO OR OR

00:47:29.346 --> 00:47:32.149
BELOW THE RATE WRITTEN WHICH WE

00:47:32.216 --> 00:47:33.650
CURRENTLY HAVE THE SYSTEM --

00:47:33.717 --> 00:47:35.519
WHICH USES PATIENT HARM SO FOR

00:47:35.586 --> 00:47:37.588
EXAMPLE IF YOU HAD A MEDICATION

00:47:37.654 --> 00:47:39.923
AIR -- AS STATED THE ANALYSIS IT

00:47:39.990 --> 00:47:41.658
WOULD BE A SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND

00:47:41.725 --> 00:47:43.160
DOLLAR PENALTY -- BUT IF YOU HAD

00:47:43.227 --> 00:47:44.895
A NURSE THAT NEEDED TO ADDRESS A

00:47:44.962 --> 00:47:47.764
PATIENT'S ACUITY -- AND WE THEN

00:47:47.831 --> 00:47:49.299
WERE HAD A GAP IN THAT RATIO

00:47:49.366 --> 00:47:50.667
WOULD BE A THIRTY THOUSAND

00:47:50.734 --> 00:47:53.470
DOLLAR PENALTY SO AS WE LOOK AT

00:47:53.537 --> 00:47:54.805
FOR THE SECOND VIOLATION OF THE

00:47:54.871 --> 00:47:56.773
LOOK AT THIS BILL WE THINK ABOUT

00:47:56.840 --> 00:47:58.141
THE CURRENT SYSTEM.

00:47:58.208 --> 00:48:00.310
WHERE THERE'S TO PUT DUPLICATION

00:48:00.377 --> 00:48:01.912
IN THE SYSTEM I'M IN THE CURRENT

00:48:01.979 --> 00:48:04.147
SYSTEM AND IN THIS BILL AND THEN

00:48:04.214 --> 00:48:05.515
HOW WE ADDRESS THAT FINE --

00:48:05.582 --> 00:48:07.084
AMOUNT SO WE ARE LOOKING AT THE

00:48:07.150 --> 00:48:08.919
AMENDMENTS TO IT TOO I'M SEE IF

00:48:08.986 --> 00:48:10.153

00:49:44.815 --> 00:49:47.384
QUICKLY -- A YEAR OR SO AGO MY

00:49:47.451 --> 00:49:49.853

00:49:53.690 --> 00:49:54.691
DISTRICT.

00:49:54.758 --> 00:50:00.097
WHERE I SAW NURSES RUN AROUND --

00:50:00.163 --> 00:50:02.766
WHAT APPEARED TO BE A LACK?

00:50:02.833 --> 00:50:05.602
OF STAFF -- AS WE TRY TO ASK

00:50:05.669 --> 00:50:07.437
QUESTIONS THEY WERE VERY

00:50:07.504 --> 00:50:09.873
SUPPORTIVE AND HELPFUL.

00:50:09.940 --> 00:50:13.410
BUT I ALSO FELT THAT -- THEY

00:50:13.477 --> 00:50:15.245
NEEDED A LITTLE BIT MORE SUPPORT --

00:50:15.312 --> 00:50:16.680
I'M GLAD.

00:50:16.747 --> 00:50:17.814
THAT THE HOSPITALS ARE IN

00:50:17.881 --> 00:50:19.750

00:50:19.816 --> 00:50:22.185
TO HOW TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES.

00:50:22.252 --> 00:50:24.621
I THINK EVERYONE IN THE ROOM

00:50:24.688 --> 00:50:27.224
WANTS TO KNOW THAT THE SAFETY.

00:50:27.290 --> 00:50:28.592
OF OUR FAMILY MEMBERS WHETHER

00:50:28.658 --> 00:50:30.560
IT'S FAMILY MEMBERS OR OUR

00:50:30.627 --> 00:50:32.295
SELVES IS THE PRIORITY.

00:50:32.362 --> 00:50:34.765
BUT THAT CAN'T HAPPEN IF NURSES

00:50:34.831 --> 00:50:36.566
ARE OVER WORKED.

00:50:36.633 --> 00:50:38.468
AND IF THERE'S AN UNDERSTAFFED

00:50:38.535 --> 00:50:39.169
THE STAFF.

00:50:39.236 --> 00:50:40.203
SO I HOPE THAT THERE'S A

00:50:40.270 --> 00:50:43.006
RESOLUTION I HOPE THAT WE CAN

00:50:43.073 --> 00:50:44.841

PATIENT RATIO THAT IS -- TO THE

00:50:55.152 --> 00:50:57.254
CORE OF WHAT NURSES DO WHICH IS

00:50:57.320 --> 00:50:58.522
TAKE CARE OF PATIENTS.

00:50:58.588 --> 00:51:00.123

00:51:12.536 --> 00:51:14.271

00:51:14.337 --> 00:51:15.172

AMENDMENTS THAT YOU TOOK.

00:51:36.226 --> 00:51:37.327

00:51:40.864 --> 00:51:42.265
THERE WE TOOK OUT BEFORE IT WENT

TO THE GOVERNOR.

00:51:43.233 --> 00:51:44.468
AND HE VETOED IT.

00:51:44.534 --> 00:51:46.002
AND IS THE VERSION THAT WE'RE

00:51:46.069 --> 00:51:47.337

COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS TO THAT

00:51:50.106 --> 00:51:50.941

00:51:51.007 --> 00:51:52.809
IT DOESN'T IT DOESN'T IT THIS IS

00:51:52.876 --> 00:51:55.111

00:51:55.178 --> 00:51:57.113
THE PENALTY AMOUNT THOSE PART OF

00:51:57.180 --> 00:51:59.182
THE AMENDMENTS THAT WE TOOK SO

00:51:59.249 --> 00:52:01.785
IT'S FIFTEEN THOUSAND AND THIRTY

00:52:01.852 --> 00:52:03.620
THOUSAND FOR A SECOND VIOLATION --

00:52:03.687 --> 00:52:04.988
AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE NEW

00:52:05.055 --> 00:52:06.623
GOVERNOR WILL DO THAT'S PART OF

00:52:06.690 --> 00:52:07.657
THE REASON WE RE INTRODUCED IT.

00:52:07.724 --> 00:52:09.459

ALRIGHT THANK YOU YOU'RE WELCOME

00:52:26.209 --> 00:52:26.443
[inaudible]

00:52:26.510 --> 00:52:29.813
ANYONE ELSE.

00:52:29.880 --> 00:52:30.514
SEE NO ONE WOULD YOU LIKE TO

00:52:30.580 --> 00:52:31.481
CLOSE CENTER YES THANK YOU VERY

00:52:31.548 --> 00:52:32.549
MUCH THANK YOU FOR THE

00:52:32.616 --> 00:52:34.150
DISCUSSION I JUST WANT TO POINT

00:52:34.217 --> 00:52:35.118
OUT TWO THINGS THAT THE

00:52:35.185 --> 00:52:36.386
OPPOSITION RAISED.

00:52:36.453 --> 00:52:38.321
I DON'T KNOW IF THE SIX HUNDRED

00:52:38.388 --> 00:52:39.923
AND THIRTY FOUR OUT OF RATIO

00:52:39.990 --> 00:52:41.424
DEFICIENCIES THAT I MENTIONED

00:52:41.491 --> 00:52:42.859
EQUAL THE 1% THAT THEY WERE

00:52:42.926 --> 00:52:44.160
TALKING ABOUT.

00:52:44.227 --> 00:52:45.962
BUT WHAT I WOULD SAY IS SIX

00:52:46.029 --> 00:52:47.531
HUNDRED AND THORPE THIRTY FOUR

00:52:47.597 --> 00:52:49.132
OUT OF RATIO DEFICIENCIES THAT'S

00:52:49.199 --> 00:52:51.167
A MINIMUM OF SIX HUNDRED AND

00:52:51.234 --> 00:52:52.068
THIRTY FOUR PATIENTS SO

00:52:52.135 --> 00:52:54.337
SOMETIMES WE LOOK AT THINGS THAT

00:52:54.404 --> 00:52:56.406
WE THINK 1% 2% IT SEEMS VERY LOW.

00:52:56.473 --> 00:52:58.041
BUT TO ME THOSE ARE SIX HUNDRED

00:52:58.108 --> 00:52:59.075
AND THIRTY FOUR LIVES AT A

00:52:59.142 --> 00:53:01.578
MINIMUM THAT WERE AFFECTED BY

00:53:01.645 --> 00:53:02.946
THOSE OUT OF RATIO --

00:53:03.013 --> 00:53:05.148
DEFICIENCIES AND THEN THE SECOND

00:53:05.215 --> 00:53:07.183
IS TO ASSEMBLYMEMBER MCCARTY'S

00:53:07.250 --> 00:53:09.853
ABOUT THE THE VIOLATIONS YOU

00:53:09.920 --> 00:53:11.121
KNOW NGUYEN DOCTOR WOULDN'T I

00:53:11.187 --> 00:53:13.857
TALKED ABOUT -- REDUCING THE

00:53:13.924 --> 00:53:15.625
AMOUNT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I

00:53:15.692 --> 00:53:17.193
MENTIONED TO HIM WAS I WORRIED

00:53:17.260 --> 00:53:18.895
THAT FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS

00:53:18.962 --> 00:53:20.764
WAS NOT ENOUGH AND THAT I WAS

00:53:20.830 --> 00:53:22.732
WORRIED THAT HOSPITALS WOULD SEE

00:53:22.799 --> 00:53:25.235
IT AS A COST OF DOING BUSINESS.

00:53:25.302 --> 00:53:26.570
SO WE FEEL LIKE WE ARE IN A

00:53:26.636 --> 00:53:28.705
POSITION WHERE THIS WILL BE SOME

00:53:28.772 --> 00:53:30.407
SORT OF A PENALTY THAT WILL THEY

00:53:30.473 --> 00:53:32.542
WILL WAKE UP AND NOT WORK A

00:53:32.609 --> 00:53:33.777
LITTLE HARDER.

00:53:33.843 --> 00:53:34.978
ON MAKING SURE THEY'RE NOT OUT

00:53:35.045 --> 00:53:36.980
OF RATIO SOMETHING ELSE THAT WE

00:53:37.047 --> 00:53:38.315
TOOK -- ANOTHER AMENDMENT THAT

00:53:38.381 --> 00:53:39.449
WE TOOK THAT I THINK IS VERY

00:53:39.516 --> 00:53:40.317
IMPORTANT.

00:53:40.383 --> 00:53:42.285
IS AN EXEMPTION FOR WHEN NURSES

00:53:42.352 --> 00:53:44.754
ARE SIX UNEXPECTEDLY INJURED OR

00:53:44.821 --> 00:53:46.823
LATE IT NOW SAYS OF A HOSPITAL

00:53:46.890 --> 00:53:48.592
CAN DEMONSTRATE THAT THERE WERE

00:53:48.658 --> 00:53:50.193
PROBLEMS EFFORTS MADE. TO

00:53:50.260 --> 00:53:52.128
REPLACE THE NURSE AND MAINTAIN

00:53:52.195 --> 00:53:54.097
THE REQUIRED STAFFING LEVELS

00:53:54.164 --> 00:53:55.665
SUCH AS EXHAUSTING THEY'RE ON

00:53:55.732 --> 00:53:57.300
CALL LISTS AND UTILIZING THE

00:53:57.367 --> 00:53:59.102
CHARGE NEW NURSE THEN THE

00:53:59.169 --> 00:54:00.770
HOSPITAL WOULD NOT BE PENALIZED.

00:54:00.837 --> 00:54:02.038
SO I THINK THOSE ARE AMENDMENTS

00:54:02.105 --> 00:54:03.640
THAT I HOPE WILL GO A LONG WAY

00:54:03.707 --> 00:54:05.208
IN ALLEVIATING THE FEARS OF THE

00:54:05.275 --> 00:54:07.544
OPPOSITION AT THE END OF THE DAY

00:54:07.611 --> 00:54:08.378
WERE LOOKING TO TAKE CARE OF

00:54:08.445 --> 00:54:09.846
PATIENTS. FOR ALSO LOOKING TO

00:54:09.913 --> 00:54:11.514
TAKE CARE OF OUR NURSES AS MANY

00:54:11.581 --> 00:54:12.949
OF YOU HAVE HEARD ME SAY --

00:54:13.016 --> 00:54:14.751
PEOPLE WHO BECOME NURSES DON'T

00:54:14.818 --> 00:54:16.052
DO IT NECESSARILY FOR THE MONEY

00:54:16.119 --> 00:54:17.420
THEY DO BECAUSE THEY TRULY CARE

00:54:17.487 --> 00:54:19.689
ABOUT PEOPLE AND THEY WILL SKIP

00:54:19.756 --> 00:54:21.157
BREAKS THEY WILL SKIP LUNCHES

00:54:21.224 --> 00:54:22.359
BECAUSE THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT

00:54:22.425 --> 00:54:23.860
THE SAFETY OF THEIR PATIENTS.

00:54:23.927 --> 00:54:28.398
SO WE HOPE THAT THIS BILL WILL

00:54:28.465 --> 00:54:30.233
MAKE THINGS BETTER FOR EVERYONE

00:54:30.300 --> 00:54:31.167
AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK

00:54:31.234 --> 00:54:31.568

LINK TO REPRODUCTIVE TOXICITY

01:02:01.250 --> 01:02:02.585
THE VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUND

01:02:02.652 --> 01:02:04.120

ENDOCRINE DISRUPTING AFFECTS.

01:02:11.794 --> 01:02:12.795
YET AS WE'VE HEARD NO FEDERAL

01:02:12.862 --> 01:02:14.564

PRODUCT MANUFACTURERS OR THE FDA.

01:02:20.369 --> 01:02:22.271
THIS MEANS THAT WELL RECOGNIZED

01:02:22.338 --> 01:02:24.307
CHEMICAL HAZARDS CAN HIDE BEHIND

01:02:24.373 --> 01:02:27.143
THE TERM FRAGRANCE OR FLAVOR

LISTED ON A PRODUCT LABEL.

01:02:28.711 --> 01:02:30.379
I BELIEVE THAT CONSUMERS AND

01:02:30.446 --> 01:02:32.815

01:02:32.882 --> 01:02:34.851

01:02:38.955 --> 01:02:40.490

01:02:40.556 --> 01:02:43.025
WHY ARE THESE EXPOSURES RELEVANT?

01:02:43.092 --> 01:02:44.026
MAYBE THERE'S ONLY A TINY AMOUNT

01:02:44.093 --> 01:02:45.394
OF THIS HAZARDOUS CHEMICAL IN A

01:02:45.461 --> 01:02:47.563
PRODUCT.

01:02:47.630 --> 01:02:48.631
THERE ARE THREE IMPORTANT POINTS

01:02:48.698 --> 01:02:50.933
ABOUT THIS THE FIRST IS THAT THE

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:52.935

01:02:53.002 --> 01:02:54.937

01:02:56.572 --> 01:02:57.507
DATA.

01:02:57.573 --> 01:02:58.808
SHOWS THAT THE EMISSIONS OF

01:02:58.875 --> 01:03:00.409
VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS FROM

01:03:00.476 --> 01:03:02.311

TONS A DAY IN CALIFORNIA.

01:03:06.983 --> 01:03:08.217
THIS GIVES YOU A SENSE OF THE

01:03:08.284 --> 01:03:09.485
VOLUME OF THESE CHEMICALS IN

01:03:09.552 --> 01:03:10.920

01:03:10.987 --> 01:03:12.855
SECOND EXPOSURES TO EVEN VERY

01:03:12.922 --> 01:03:14.390
LOW DOSES OF HORMONALLY ACTIVE

01:03:14.457 --> 01:03:15.458
CHEMICALS TURNED OUT TO BE

01:03:15.525 --> 01:03:16.826
PARTICULARLY SIGNIFICANT FOR

01:03:16.893 --> 01:03:18.327
PREGNANT WOMEN INFANTS AND

01:03:18.394 --> 01:03:20.363

HORMONAL SIGNALS.

01:03:24.834 --> 01:03:26.435
AND FINALLY WE'RE NOT EXPOSED TO

FRAGRANCE ALLERGIES.

01:04:01.971 --> 01:04:03.039

MORTALITY IS REALLY A TIME FOR

02:01:05.024 --> 02:01:06.359
COURAGEOUS CHANGE AND I THINK

02:01:06.425 --> 02:01:09.629
SENATE BILL FOUR SIX FOUR WILL

02:01:09.695 --> 02:01:11.931
DO THAT FOR US -- THERE'S JUST

02:01:11.998 --> 02:01:14.100
FOUR THINGS I WANT TO COMMENT ON

BRIEFLY.

02:01:14.400 --> 02:01:16.669
ON THE BILL.

02:01:16.736 --> 02:01:18.137
THE FIRST IS.

02:01:18.204 --> 02:01:21.040
WE NEED MORE INFORMATION ABOUT

02:01:21.107 --> 02:01:23.042
THE DEATHS OF WOMEN.

02:01:23.109 --> 02:01:25.177
AND OF THEIR BABIES OFTENTIMES A

02:01:25.244 --> 02:01:27.847
MEDICAL RECORDS ARE NOT COMPLETE.

02:01:27.913 --> 02:01:30.483
I DID A FULL AUDIT A ONE OF THE

THOSE OF YOU THAT MIGHT KNOW THE

02:01:34.854 --> 02:01:37.823
AREA -- I DID A FULL AUDIT TO MY

YEAR PERIOD OF TIME ALL THEIR

02:01:45.531 --> 02:01:49.669
DELIVERY RECORDS TO SEE WHAT

02:01:49.735 --> 02:01:51.203
THERE WERE MANY.

02:01:51.270 --> 02:01:52.805
WE DON'T NEED TO GO INTO THAT WE

02:01:52.872 --> 02:01:54.407
KNOW THAT WE CAN TELL THAT THERE

02:01:54.473 --> 02:01:56.108
ARE BIASES BASED ON INFANT

02:01:56.175 --> 02:01:58.277
MORTALITY THAT IS FOUR TIMES

02:01:58.344 --> 02:02:00.279
HIGHER -- THREE TWO TIMES HIGHER

TIMES HIGHER IN THE BLACK

02:02:03.816 --> 02:02:04.684
COMMUNITY.

02:02:04.750 --> 02:02:07.253
WE CAN NO LONGER JUST SIT BACK

02:02:07.319 --> 02:02:07.887
BUT YOU KNOW I SAID THAT THIRTY

02:02:07.953 --> 02:02:09.422
YEARS AGO.

02:02:09.488 --> 02:02:10.990
AND MICKEY LELAND'S HEARING IN

02:02:11.057 --> 02:02:12.391
IN IN [inaudible]

02:02:12.458 --> 02:02:16.228
WASHINGTON -- BUT WE NEED MORE

02:02:16.295 --> 02:02:18.164
INFORMATION ON OUR BIRTH

02:02:18.230 --> 02:02:21.067

02:02:21.133 --> 02:02:22.601
AUTOMATICALLY NOW IN OUR

02:02:22.668 --> 02:02:24.103
ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS.

02:02:24.170 --> 02:02:25.871
SHARE WITH THE PHYSICIANS TO

02:02:25.938 --> 02:02:26.839
DELIVERED.

02:02:26.906 --> 02:02:28.841
THE BABIES THEY DON'T HAVE TO

02:02:28.908 --> 02:02:30.943
SHARE THE NAMES BUT THEY SHOULD

02:02:31.010 --> 02:02:33.079
KNOW OF ALL THEIR DELIVERIES HOW

02:02:33.145 --> 02:02:34.814
MANY OF THESE BABIES ACTUALLY

02:02:34.880 --> 02:02:36.282
DIED IN CONGREGATE.

02:02:36.348 --> 02:02:38.050
HOW MANY OF THE MOTHERS HAD

02:02:38.117 --> 02:02:40.186
PROBLEMS POST PARTUM AND PASSED

02:02:40.252 --> 02:02:41.587
AWAY POSTPARTUM?

02:02:41.654 --> 02:02:43.055
WE DON'T EVEN KNOW THAT AS OF

02:02:43.122 --> 02:02:45.091
THIS POINT THE PHYSICIAN RECORDS

02:02:45.157 --> 02:02:46.992
ARE NOT ACCURATE ENOUGH THEY

02:02:47.059 --> 02:02:48.160
NEED TO HAVE A CASE.

02:02:48.227 --> 02:02:49.695
THERE HAS TO COME FROM THE BIRTH

02:02:49.762 --> 02:02:50.563
RECORD.

02:02:50.629 --> 02:02:53.499
AND THE PHYSICIANS OFTENTIMES DO

02:02:53.566 --> 02:02:54.467
NOT HAVE THAT.

02:02:54.533 --> 02:02:56.435
SECONDLY I THINK THERE NEEDS TO

02:02:56.502 --> 02:02:58.204
BE AN ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM. FOR

02:02:58.270 --> 02:02:59.739
THE DOCKS AND THIS WOULD BE ONE

02:02:59.805 --> 02:03:01.507
OF THE ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEMS

02:03:01.574 --> 02:03:03.976
THERE'S RIGHT NOW THEY'RE NOT

02:03:04.043 --> 02:03:05.077
ACCOUNTABLE TO ANYBODY

02:03:05.144 --> 02:03:05.377

02:03:05.444 --> 02:03:07.079
IN REALITY.

02:03:07.146 --> 02:03:08.280
THEY'RE NOT ACCOUNTABLE TO

02:03:08.347 --> 02:03:09.281
ANYBODY.

02:03:09.348 --> 02:03:10.850
EVEN TO SOME OF THE COMMITTEES

02:03:10.916 --> 02:03:12.985
IN THE HOSPITALS THEY DON'T HAVE

02:03:13.052 --> 02:03:15.121
TO ACTUALLY REPORT ON ALL OF THE

02:03:15.187 --> 02:03:16.756
ISSUES THAT HAVE MAY HAVE RISEN

02:03:16.822 --> 02:03:17.690
AND WHAT THEY HAVE DONE TO

02:03:17.757 --> 02:03:18.891
IMPROVE.

02:03:18.958 --> 02:03:20.860
ON THOSE ISSUES.

02:03:20.926 --> 02:03:22.461
NEEDLESS TO SAY.

02:03:22.528 --> 02:03:25.331
THINGS AROUND IMPLICIT BIAS.

02:03:25.397 --> 02:03:27.133
WHICH IS IN THE OLD DAYS YOU

02:03:27.199 --> 02:03:28.634
JUST CALLED STRAIGHT UP RACISM.

02:03:28.701 --> 02:03:30.269

EVEN SEEN THE PATIENT.

02:03:41.914 --> 02:03:43.849
THAT IS REALLY A PROBLEM.

02:03:43.916 --> 02:03:46.085
SO WE REALLY NEED TO BE ABLE TO

AMENDMENT THAT WE ARE STILL

ALREADY WHEN IN THE BILL ON THE

REQUIREMENTS TO OSHKOSH WE ARE

02:22:59.570 --> 02:23:01.539
SIMPLY LOOKING FOR THE SAME

02:23:01.606 --> 02:23:04.042
DELAY -- INTO LAS POD CAN DO

02:23:04.108 --> 02:23:06.210

AT AT THE QUARTERLY REPORTING

02:23:17.889 --> 02:23:19.624
BUT WE SIMPLY WOULD ASK FOR A

02:23:19.691 --> 02:23:22.093
DELAYED IMPLEMENTATION TO ALLOW.

02:23:22.160 --> 02:23:23.695
A KAISER PERMANENTE TO RAMP UP

02:23:23.761 --> 02:23:24.896

02:23:31.536 --> 02:23:32.704
HAVE AGREED TO ALMOST EVERYTHING

02:23:32.770 --> 02:23:34.772
IN THIS BILL WE WE ACTUALLY HAVE

02:23:34.839 --> 02:23:36.107
MET THE AUTHOR.

02:23:36.174 --> 02:23:37.909

APPRECIATE -- ALL OF THAT THE

02:23:41.045 --> 02:23:42.780
CONVERSATIONS SENATOR PAN

02:23:42.847 --> 02:23:44.782
COMMITTED EARLY ON I IN IN THE

02:23:44.849 --> 02:23:46.884
SENATE TO WORK WITH US IN IN TO

02:23:46.951 --> 02:23:48.853
ENTERTAIN REASONABLE AMENDMENTS

02:23:48.920 --> 02:23:50.121
THAT WOULD ADDRESS OUR CONCERNS

02:23:50.188 --> 02:23:51.489
WHICH WE DO APPRECIATE.

02:23:51.556 --> 02:23:53.791
I THINK THIS IS THE EPITOME OF A

02:23:53.858 --> 02:23:55.793
REASONABLE MAN AND AND JUST TO

02:23:55.860 --> 02:23:57.462
ADDRESS THAT THE SPONSORS --

02:23:57.528 --> 02:23:58.429
HEALTHCARE COSTS ARE ARE

02:23:58.496 --> 02:24:00.031
CONCERNED AS WELL -- WE

02:24:00.098 --> 02:24:01.632
ABSOLUTELY SURE THAT CONCERN

02:24:01.699 --> 02:24:02.634
WHICH IS ACTUALLY WHY THIS

02:24:02.700 --> 02:24:09.640
AMENDMENT IS SO IMPORTANT IS IT.

02:24:09.707 --> 02:24:10.942
WILL ALLOW US -- TO HAVE

02:24:11.009 --> 02:24:11.976
ADMINISTRATIVELY MORE SIMPLIFIED

02:24:12.043 --> 02:24:13.378
WAY OF REPORTING THIS DATA IN

02:24:13.444 --> 02:24:13.911
EIGHTEEN MONTHS IF WE WAIT

02:24:13.978 --> 02:24:14.512
EIGHTEEN MONTHS -- OFSHE BUT

02:24:14.579 --> 02:24:15.013
WILL HAVE UPGRADED THEIR

02:24:15.079 --> 02:24:16.514
TECHNOLOGY SO I WON'T HAVE TO

02:24:16.581 --> 02:24:18.850
HIRE ADDITIONAL PEOPLE TO DO

02:24:18.916 --> 02:24:20.852
THIS THOUSANDS OF FIELD OF

02:24:20.918 --> 02:24:22.687
MANUAL DATA ENTRY WHICH IS HOW

02:24:22.754 --> 02:24:24.789
WE WOULD HAVE TO DO IT NOW -- WE

02:24:24.856 --> 02:24:26.791
THINK IT MAKES MORE SENSE -- AND

02:24:26.858 --> 02:24:28.593
IS MORE COST EFFECTIVE TO JUST

02:24:28.659 --> 02:24:30.595
ALLOW OURSELVES TO BUILD UP TO

02:24:30.661 --> 02:24:31.963
THAT SYSTEM ALLOW OCCUPIED TO

02:24:32.030 --> 02:24:34.766
BUILD UP TO THAT AND TO CONTINUE --

02:24:34.832 --> 02:24:36.100
TO BE GOOD STEWARDS OF OUR

02:24:36.167 --> 02:24:37.735
MEMBER DOLLARS SO --

02:24:37.802 --> 02:24:38.736
UNFORTUNATELY WITHOUT THAT A

02:24:38.803 --> 02:24:40.438
MINUTE WE WILL HAVE TO CONTINUE

02:24:40.505 --> 02:24:42.006
TO OPPOSE THE BILL BUT AGAIN --

02:24:42.073 --> 02:24:43.441

[inaudible]

02:24:50.014 --> 02:24:52.550
ANYONE ELSE. TO KNOWN BRING IT

02:24:52.617 --> 02:24:54.318
BACK TO COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS

02:24:54.385 --> 02:24:55.820

FOR DR PANDERING TO SEE YOU AND

02:24:57.321 --> 02:24:58.723
THE FIRST TIME I HEARD THIS BILL

02:24:58.790 --> 02:25:00.391
IT HAS COME A LONG WAY SO I MEAN

02:25:00.458 --> 02:25:01.459
DESERVE A TIME A CREDIT FOR

02:25:01.526 --> 02:25:02.827
WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION IT'S

02:25:02.894 --> 02:25:04.462
ACTUALLY QUITE REMARKABLE HOW

02:25:04.529 --> 02:25:05.897
WELL THIS IS COME TOGETHER.

02:25:05.963 --> 02:25:06.497
BUT I DO HAVE JUST THAT ONE

02:25:06.564 --> 02:25:08.332
QUESTION IN YOUR OPINION WHAT IS

02:25:08.399 --> 02:25:09.133
THE CONCERN.

02:25:09.200 --> 02:25:12.103
WITH THE LANE IMPLEMENTATION OF

02:25:12.170 --> 02:25:13.471
THE QUARTERLY FILINGS.

02:25:13.538 --> 02:25:15.339
SO -- I THINK THE CHALLENGES IS

02:25:15.406 --> 02:25:17.575
THAT -- WHAT WE THE PURPOSE OF

02:25:17.642 --> 02:25:20.278
THE BILL IS TO HAVE KAISER

02:25:20.344 --> 02:25:22.713
REPORT -- RECOGNIZING THE KAISER

02:25:22.780 --> 02:25:25.183
IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT -- TO HAVE

02:25:25.249 --> 02:25:27.218
THAT ESSENTIALLY REPORT THAT

02:25:27.285 --> 02:25:29.287
SAME OR SIMILAR DATA -- WITHIN

02:25:29.353 --> 02:25:31.322
REASON AS ALL OTHER HOSPITALS

02:25:31.389 --> 02:25:33.925
AND HEALTH PLANS RIGHT AND SO.

02:25:33.991 --> 02:25:35.560
THE CHALLENGE ON THE QUARTERLY

02:25:35.626 --> 02:25:37.428
REPORT RIGHT NOW SO I CERTAINLY --

02:25:37.495 --> 02:25:40.264
YOU KNOW KAISER SAID CAN WE WAIT

02:25:40.331 --> 02:25:41.165
EIGHTEEN MONTHS BECAUSE I ASK

02:25:41.232 --> 02:25:42.100
WHAT'S GOING TO MOVE TO

02:25:42.166 --> 02:25:43.634
ELECTRONIC SYSTEM.

02:25:43.701 --> 02:25:45.103
AND SO THEREFORE THEY WOULD HAVE

02:25:45.169 --> 02:25:49.273
TO FILE THESE REPORTS MANUALLY.

02:25:49.340 --> 02:25:50.074
I GUESS THE CHALLENGE WERE FACED

02:25:50.141 --> 02:25:53.044
WITH IS THAT.

02:25:53.111 --> 02:25:54.579
HOSPITALS ALL THE OTHER

02:25:54.645 --> 02:25:56.581
HOSPITALS IN THE STATE.

02:25:56.647 --> 02:25:59.250
ARE HAVING TO REPORT THE SAME OR

02:25:59.317 --> 02:26:01.986
SIMILAR DATA MANUALLY.

02:26:02.053 --> 02:26:03.654
ALREADY RIGHT SO THEY ARE

02:26:03.721 --> 02:26:06.657
CURRENTLY DOING IT NOW AND SO I

02:26:06.724 --> 02:26:07.625
GUESS THE QUESTION IS IS THAT

02:26:07.692 --> 02:26:09.127
AND THERE YOU KNOW I MEAN WE

02:26:09.193 --> 02:26:10.261
DON'T WANT TO SUPPOSE EXPECTS

02:26:10.328 --> 02:26:11.462
FENCES ON EVERYBODY BUT THEY'RE

02:26:11.529 --> 02:26:12.864
ALSO THEY'RE ACTUALLY OCCURRING

02:26:12.930 --> 02:26:15.800
THAT EXPENSE OF MANUALLY AND

02:26:15.867 --> 02:26:16.434
THINGS THAT THE ONLY WAY TO DO.

02:26:16.501 --> 02:26:16.767
IT RIGHT NOW.

02:26:16.834 --> 02:26:17.935
I THOUGHT IS MOVING TO

02:26:18.002 --> 02:26:19.237
ELECTRONIC SYSTEM SO HOPEFULLY

02:26:19.303 --> 02:26:20.738
EVERYBODY WILL BE ABLE TO MOVE

02:26:20.805 --> 02:26:22.974
AT THE SAME TIME -- IN EIGHTEEN

02:26:23.040 --> 02:26:23.708
MONTHS.

02:26:23.774 --> 02:26:25.276
BUT I THINK THE CHALLENGES SO

02:26:25.343 --> 02:26:27.078
THE QUESTION IS IS THIS IT'S NOT

02:26:27.145 --> 02:26:28.880
THAT KAISER CAN'T REPORT THE

02:26:28.946 --> 02:26:30.214
DATA [inaudible]

02:26:30.281 --> 02:26:31.716
RIGHT.

02:26:31.782 --> 02:26:34.152
BUT IT WOULD TAKE SOME EXTRA

02:26:34.218 --> 02:26:36.020
EFFORT TO DO THAT BUT EVERY

02:26:36.087 --> 02:26:37.855
OTHER HOSPITAL IN THE STATE IS

02:26:37.922 --> 02:26:39.524
CURRENTLY REQUIRED BY LAW TO

02:26:39.590 --> 02:26:41.092
EXERT THAT EFFORT THEMSELVES TO

02:26:41.159 --> 02:26:42.627
DO THAT.

02:26:42.693 --> 02:26:44.962
AND SO YOU KNOW THAT THERE'S A

02:26:45.029 --> 02:26:46.030
QUESTION IF THERE IF THERE'S A

02:26:46.097 --> 02:26:46.764
SO THIS IS LIKE THIS FINAL

02:26:46.831 --> 02:26:47.431
LITTLE BIT BUT THERE'S A

02:26:47.498 --> 02:26:50.201
QUESTION OF FAIRNESS ABOUT WELL.

02:26:50.268 --> 02:26:51.969
IF KAISER DOESN'T HAVE TO DO IT

02:26:52.036 --> 02:26:53.304
EVERY OTHER HOSPITAL AND THEY

02:26:53.371 --> 02:26:54.305
HAVE BY THE WAY THEY'RE SPENDING

02:26:54.372 --> 02:26:55.339
MONEY TRY YOU KNOW PROVIDING

02:26:55.406 --> 02:26:56.474
THAT INFORMATION AND THAT

02:26:56.541 --> 02:26:58.242
INFORMATION IS USEFUL.

02:26:58.309 --> 02:27:00.178
I MEAN IT'S NOT IT'S NOT JUST

02:27:00.244 --> 02:27:00.978
LIKE ALWAYS WANT YOU FILL OUT

02:27:01.045 --> 02:27:02.146
PAPER JUST STOPPED PAPER.

02:27:02.213 --> 02:27:04.549
IT IS IT IS IT USEFUL TO

02:27:04.615 --> 02:27:07.218
UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON YOU

02:27:07.285 --> 02:27:09.620
KNOW AT SO YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS

02:27:09.687 --> 02:27:11.622
IS IT FAIR TO SAY WELL BECAUSE

02:27:11.689 --> 02:27:12.690
YOU HAVE IT WOULDN'T GIVE YOU

02:27:12.757 --> 02:27:13.758
EXTRA TIME.

02:27:13.824 --> 02:27:15.560
VERSES EVERYONE ELSE TO ACTUALLY

02:27:15.626 --> 02:27:17.528
HAVE TO DO IT STILL HAS TO DO IT

02:27:17.595 --> 02:27:19.063
RIGHT AND I THINK THAT'S THAT

02:27:19.130 --> 02:27:20.665
THAT THAT'S THE BIT WERE

02:27:20.731 --> 02:27:23.901
STRUGGLING WITH BECAUSE I

02:27:23.968 --> 02:27:25.269
CERTAINLY HEAR WHAT KINDS ARE

02:27:25.336 --> 02:27:25.937
SAYING YOU KNOW WE HAVE A DUE TO

02:27:26.003 --> 02:27:27.538
WE RAMP UP AND SO FORTH BUT IT'S

02:27:27.605 --> 02:27:30.575
NOT.

02:27:30.641 --> 02:27:31.209
THAT THEY CAN'T DO IT IT'S JUST

02:27:31.275 --> 02:27:32.243
THAT.

02:27:32.310 --> 02:27:33.377
THEY SAID YEAH IT DOES TAKE --

02:27:33.444 --> 02:27:33.978
SOME EXTRA PEOPLE SOME EXTRA

02:27:34.045 --> 02:27:35.112
WORK BUT EVERY OTHER HOSPITAL.

02:27:35.179 --> 02:27:37.181
WE'VE ACTUALLY MADE ALSO THEY'RE

02:27:37.248 --> 02:27:38.382
READY HAVE MEET THEY HAVE TO

02:27:38.449 --> 02:27:39.884
ALSO SPEND THAT EXPENSE DOING IT

02:27:39.951 --> 02:27:41.719
AS WELL AND I AM GLAD THAT

02:27:41.786 --> 02:27:42.753
OXFORD'S MOVING TO A SYSTEM

02:27:42.820 --> 02:27:44.088
THEY'LL ACTUALLY REQUIRE LESS

02:27:44.155 --> 02:27:45.523
EFFORT IN EIGHTEEN MONTHS.

02:27:45.590 --> 02:27:47.058
BUT UNTIL THEN EVERY OTHER

02:27:47.124 --> 02:27:48.759
HOSPITAL CLEAN HOSPITALS IN YOUR

02:27:48.826 --> 02:27:50.161
DISTRICT ARE NOT KAISER ARE.

02:27:50.228 --> 02:27:51.462
TAKING THE TIME TO DO THAT SO

02:27:51.529 --> 02:27:52.563
THAT WE CAN HAVE THE DATA AND WE

02:27:52.630 --> 02:27:54.498
NEED TO DO THE OVERSIGHT AND

02:27:54.565 --> 02:27:58.402
THAT'S WHY WE'RE HAVING.

02:27:58.469 --> 02:28:00.705
THIS YEAH WE DECIDE NOT TO TAKE

02:28:00.771 --> 02:28:03.341
THEM AND THAT -- YEAH.

02:28:03.407 --> 02:28:05.176
BUT THE FAIRNESS ISSUE THERE.

02:28:05.243 --> 02:28:06.110
NO IT IS AND I APPRECIATE THAT

02:28:06.177 --> 02:28:06.844
RESPONSE YOU KNOW AND JUST

02:28:06.911 --> 02:28:07.745
RIDLEY ALL ALL WRAPPED UP

02:28:07.812 --> 02:28:08.279
BECAUSE IT'S BEEN A LONG

02:28:08.346 --> 02:28:08.579
COMMITTEE.

02:28:08.646 --> 02:28:09.213
IN ON ON THE ON THE STRICTLY

02:28:09.280 --> 02:28:10.348
BUSINESS SIDE OF IT YOU KNOW

02:28:10.414 --> 02:28:12.383
COMING FROM OUR OUR FAMILY SIDE

02:28:12.450 --> 02:28:14.118
A MUCH SMALLER SMALLER SCALE

02:28:14.185 --> 02:28:15.353
LIKE WHEN WE IMPLEMENT A NEW

02:28:15.419 --> 02:28:16.887
PROCEDURE WHETHER WE HAVEN'T

02:28:16.954 --> 02:28:18.055
DONE IT BEFORE.

02:28:18.122 --> 02:28:19.490
AND THEN IT'S GOING TO CHANGE IN

02:28:19.557 --> 02:28:21.259
EIGHTEEN MONTHS AGAIN IT'S KIND

02:28:21.325 --> 02:28:21.892
OF DOUBLE NOT SAYING THAT THEY

02:28:21.959 --> 02:28:22.960
SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE IT PRIOR NOT

02:28:23.027 --> 02:28:24.161
SEEN ANY OF THAT.

02:28:24.228 --> 02:28:25.463
BUT JUST KIND LIKE THIS DOUBLE

02:28:25.529 --> 02:28:27.865
WHAMMY SO WHAT KIND OF TEACHING

02:28:27.932 --> 02:28:28.866
AN OLD DOG NEW TRICKS TWICE.

02:28:28.933 --> 02:28:30.501

I APPRECIATE WHERE YOU'RE COMING

02:28:47.418 --> 02:28:48.386

HAD AN EXCEPTION TO THIS FOR

02:28:49.854 --> 02:28:51.455
OVER TWENTY YEARS -- THIS

02:28:51.522 --> 02:28:54.292
REPORTING REQUIREMENT AND AS WE

02:28:54.358 --> 02:28:55.693
HEARD I BELIEVE.

02:28:55.760 --> 02:28:57.428
INFORMATION IS POWER AND IS

02:28:57.495 --> 02:28:58.963
IMPORTANT I BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE

02:28:59.030 --> 02:28:59.864
THAT INFORMATION AS SOON AS

02:28:59.930 --> 02:29:03.467
POSSIBLE SO -- GRANTED THERE IS

02:29:03.534 --> 02:29:05.036
EXPENSE TO EVERYTHING WE DO AND

02:29:05.102 --> 02:29:05.536

FROM THAT.

02:29:11.008 --> 02:29:12.243
I THINK AN EIGHTEEN MONTH DELAY

02:29:12.310 --> 02:29:14.478
IS IS UNFAIR TO OTHERS IN

02:29:14.545 --> 02:29:15.813
CALIFORNIA WE COULD BE

02:29:15.880 --> 02:29:17.281
BENEFITING FROM THAT INFORMATION.

02:29:17.348 --> 02:29:19.483
AND WHICH IS WHY WE DIDN'T ASK

02:29:19.550 --> 02:29:20.885
YOU TO TAKE THAT AMENDMENT.

02:29:20.951 --> 02:29:23.688
