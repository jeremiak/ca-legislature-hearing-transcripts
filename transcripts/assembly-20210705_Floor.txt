PULSE WAS SOLUTION THIRTY NINE BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER GIPSON AND OTHERS RELATIVE TO EQUITY IMPACT ANALYSIS OF LEGISLATION EVER GIPSON YOU MAY OPEN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MR SPEAKER AND MEMBERS. THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO. ZACKS HR THIRTY NINE THIS RESOLUTION ENCOURAGE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSEMBLY TO EXPLORE METHODS TO FORMALLY INTEGRATE EQUITY IN THE IMPACT OF EQUITIES IN EXISTING COMMITTEES AND FLOOR ANALYSIS FOR LEGISLATION AND EQUITY IMPACT ANALYSIS WOULD BE THE ANALYTICS LIENS THAT COMMITTEES COULD ADOPT TO ENSURE THAT LEGISLATION DOES NOT NEGATIVELY. COMPROMISE THE LEVEL OF OPPORTUNITY SERVICE OR A SUPPORT THAT LOW INCOME AND MODERATE INCOME COMMUNITIES RECEIVE HARDWORKING COMMITTEE CONSULTANTS KNOW BEST IT IS THE INTENT OF HR THIRTY NINE TO ENCOURAGE NOT TO MANDATE. THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE EQUITY LENS FOR LEGISLATION ANALYSIS MY HOPE IS THAT WHEN WE TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT LEGISLATION THROUGH THE EQUITY LANDS. WE INSURE THAT OUR CONSTITUENTS HAVE EQUAL ACCESS TO SERVICES SUCH AS QUALITY CARE FINANCIAL AID FOR HIGHER EDUCATION AND HOME OWNERSHIP. STRUCTURAL RACISM AFFECTS THE MOST VULNERABLE PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITY COBIT NINETEEN EXPLORES DISPARITIES IN HEALTH EDUCATION. ECONOMIC OUTCOMES FOR LOW INCOME FAMILIES EXPRESSLY FAMILIES OF COLOR NOW MORE THAN EVER EQUITY MATTERS IN CALIFORNIA PUTTING EQUITY AT THE FOREFRONT OF OUR WORK WILL HELP IDENTIFY GAPS IN OUR DECISION MAKING PROCESS AS WELL AS INTRODUCE- OR BOTH ONE PIECE OF LEGISLATION WITHOUT IT EQUITY FOCUS LANDS WE CANNOT DO THE PEOPLE'S BUSINESS WE HEARD COMMUNITIES THAT WE'RE ABSOLUTELY TRYING TO HELP I RESPECTFULLY ASK WOULD I VOTE.
