QUESTIONS -- I KNOW THE VAPING

00:19:35.173 --> 00:19:36.842
ISSUEIS JUST YOU KNOW HOT ON

00:19:36.909 --> 00:19:39.311
THE PRESS IS TODAY BUT SO I DID

KNOW VERY BEING AND IT SHOWED UP

00:19:47.853 --> 00:19:48.554
SET UP SO IN IT DID SHOW UP

00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:50.155
STUFF THAT LOOK LIKE A CHARGER

00:19:50.222 --> 00:19:51.957
LOOK LIKE A PAN.

00:19:52.024 --> 00:19:55.193
LOOK LIKE A LIKE A U. S. B. COR --

00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:57.162
PORT LIKE SOMETHING THAT WOULD

00:19:57.229 --> 00:19:57.362
CARRY.

00:19:57.429 --> 00:19:59.064
SO I GUESS TWO QUESTIONS ONE IF

00:19:59.131 --> 00:20:00.432
YOU CAN DO A GOOD EASY GOOGLE

00:20:00.499 --> 00:20:05.270
SEARCH AND HAVE IT -- WHAT WHAT

00:20:05.337 --> 00:20:06.505
WHAT MAKES YOUR BILL DIFFERENT

00:20:06.572 --> 00:20:07.606
OTHER AND I KNOW YOU'RE GONNA

00:20:07.673 --> 00:20:08.640
REPORTED TO DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC

00:20:08.707 --> 00:20:10.075
HEALTH BUT I GUESS MY SECOND

00:20:10.142 --> 00:20:11.810
QUESTION A FOLLOW UP ON THAT IS?

00:20:11.877 --> 00:20:13.378
WHAT IS THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC

00:20:13.445 --> 00:20:15.147
HEALTH GOING TO DO WITH IT?

00:20:15.213 --> 00:20:16.214
THAT WITH THANK YOU FOR THE

00:20:16.281 --> 00:20:17.349
QUESTION WELL FIRST OF ALL THIS

00:20:17.416 --> 00:20:19.818
SUGGEST -- IS A BEGINNING OF AN

00:20:19.885 --> 00:20:21.019
EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM AND I'LL

00:20:21.086 --> 00:20:21.587
TELL YOU ANYBODY CAN GOOGLE

00:20:21.653 --> 00:20:22.487
SEARCH.

00:20:22.554 --> 00:20:23.655
BUT THAT WOULD IMPLY THAT ALL OF

00:20:23.722 --> 00:20:25.090
US ARE LOOKING I DON'T HAVE

00:20:25.157 --> 00:20:27.593
CHILDREN SO AS AN EDUCATOR I

00:20:27.659 --> 00:20:29.094
NEVER EVEN THOUGHT THAT THESE

00:20:29.161 --> 00:20:31.129
ITEMS EXISTED AGAIN UNLESS

00:20:31.196 --> 00:20:32.998
YOU'RE ACTIVELY LOOKING YOU

00:20:33.065 --> 00:20:33.398
WOULDN'T SEE IT.

00:20:33.465 --> 00:20:33.899
SO OUR HOPE IS THAT THE

00:20:33.966 --> 00:20:35.834
DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH CAN

00:20:35.901 --> 00:20:36.602
PUT TOGETHER.

00:20:36.668 --> 00:20:38.270
A VISUAL EVERY TIME I NEW

00:20:38.337 --> 00:20:40.572
PRODUCT COMES TO THE MARKET THAT

00:20:40.639 --> 00:20:42.641
WE CAN SEND OUT -- TO TO SCHOOL

00:20:42.708 --> 00:20:43.842
DISTRICTS AND BY WAY OF THE IF

00:20:43.909 --> 00:20:45.811
EXAMPLE -- AS AN EDUCATOR WE

00:20:45.877 --> 00:20:47.412
HAVE STAFF MEETINGS EVERY WEEK

00:20:47.479 --> 00:20:49.214
AND SO ON MY HOPE IS THAT THE

00:20:49.281 --> 00:20:50.582
SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE AMEND

00:20:50.649 --> 00:20:52.017
EVERY TIME THEY GO TO STAFF

00:20:52.084 --> 00:20:53.285
MEETING AND ANYTIME THAT THERE

00:20:53.352 --> 00:20:54.453
IS NOT A NEW DEVICE.

00:20:54.519 --> 00:20:55.921
THEY CAN -- MAKE SURE THAT EVERY

00:20:55.988 --> 00:20:57.856
TEACHER KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT TO

00:20:57.923 --> 00:20:59.891
LOOK -- FOR SO SO THAT IT'S

00:20:59.958 --> 00:21:00.959
DIFFERENT AND NOT AGAIN WE'RE

00:21:01.026 --> 00:21:02.461
GONNA BE VERY SPECIFICALLY PUT

00:21:02.527 --> 00:21:03.829
IN THE INFORMATION THE HOUNDS OF

00:21:03.895 --> 00:21:05.297
SCHOOL DISTRICTS SO THAT PASSED

00:21:05.364 --> 00:21:06.365
DOWN TO TEACHERS.

00:21:06.431 --> 00:21:10.502
AND WHAT THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:21:10.569 --> 00:21:12.037
HEALTH WILL DO IS JUST.

00:21:12.104 --> 00:21:12.871
ADMINISTER THAT THAT THE PROGRAM

00:21:12.938 --> 00:21:13.972
IN TERMS OF PUTTING IT ON A

00:21:14.039 --> 00:21:14.640
WEBSITE AND MAKE SURE THAT EVERY

00:21:14.706 --> 00:21:16.274

00:33:27.138 --> 00:33:28.973
TOOK IN A DAY THEY KNOW NOW --

00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:30.074
THE GREAT THING ABOUT BLOCKCHAIN

00:33:30.141 --> 00:33:32.243
IS THAT A DECENTRALIZED AS THE

00:33:32.310 --> 00:33:33.745
INFORMATION AND MAKES IT

00:33:33.811 --> 00:33:35.446
SIGNIFICANTLY MORE DIFFICULT

00:33:35.513 --> 00:33:37.014
TASK -- WASHOE COUNTY USES

00:33:37.081 --> 00:33:39.317
TIGHTEN SEAL WHICH IS RUN ON THE

00:33:39.384 --> 00:33:40.551

BY DESIGN WOULD BE INCREDIBLY

00:33:51.729 --> 00:33:52.964
DIFFICULT TO HACK.

00:33:53.030 --> 00:33:54.332
CURRENTLY IF YOU WANTED TO YOU

00:33:54.399 --> 00:33:55.767
KNOW FIND BIG NO PAPER AND PHOTO

00:33:55.833 --> 00:33:56.534
SHOP IT THAT WOULD BE VERY

00:33:56.601 --> 00:33:58.035
DIFFICULT TO DO BUT LESS

00:33:58.102 --> 00:33:58.936
DIFFICULT THAN HACKING THE

01:00:34.764 --> 01:00:37.433
SO IF THIS BILL IS ENACTED WOULD

01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:38.935
PUBLIC SERVICE AGENCIES BE

01:00:39.002 --> 01:00:42.138
PERMITTED TO ACT OUTSIDE OF THE

01:00:42.205 --> 01:00:43.973

01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:45.274

01:00:45.341 --> 01:00:48.711

01:00:48.778 --> 01:00:50.513
OR MEDICARE'S PRODUCTIVITY.

01:00:50.580 --> 01:00:53.316
CHRISTIE OR THERE ARE EXPERT A

01:00:53.383 --> 01:00:58.154
GIVE YOU FURTHER DETAIL Là.

01:00:58.221 --> 01:00:58.721
JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY TO DO

01:00:58.788 --> 01:01:00.189
THAT ONE SHOULD ANSWER JUST

01:01:00.256 --> 01:01:01.124
QUESTION I DID HEAR THE QUESTION

01:01:01.190 --> 01:01:01.924
IF THIS BILL SO IF THIS BILL IS

01:01:01.991 --> 01:01:02.725
ENACTED IF THIS BILL BECOMES LAW.

01:01:02.792 --> 01:01:04.227
WITH THE PUBLIC SERVICE AGENCIES

01:01:04.293 --> 01:01:05.695
DOING THE NINE ONE ONE BECAUSE

01:01:05.762 --> 01:01:07.530
RIGHT NOW I THINK THAT. 90% OF

01:01:07.597 --> 01:01:10.800
THAT IS DONE BY PUBLIC SERVICE

01:01:10.867 --> 01:01:12.568
AGENCIES ARE CORRECT.

01:01:12.635 --> 01:01:13.202
SO IF THIS BILL IS ENACTED DOES

01:01:13.269 --> 01:01:14.070
IT CHANGE ANYTHING THAT IS

01:01:14.137 --> 01:01:16.072
DIFFERENT.

01:01:16.139 --> 01:01:17.440
WITH DOES EVERYTHING STAY THE

01:01:17.507 --> 01:01:19.675
SAME LIKE RIGHT NOW I KNOW NINE

01:01:19.742 --> 01:01:20.443
ONE ONE I HAD THIS CONVERSATION

01:01:20.510 --> 01:01:21.911
WITH CHRIS YESTERDAY WE ALL KNOW

01:01:21.978 --> 01:01:23.079
HOW I FEEL ABOUT CERTAIN THINGS

01:01:23.146 --> 01:01:24.614
AND THEM PUBLIC SERVICE AGENCIES

01:01:24.680 --> 01:01:25.782
AND THINGS LIKE THAT.

01:01:25.848 --> 01:01:27.650
BUT NINE ONE ONE YOU KNOW I

01:01:27.717 --> 01:01:29.285
THINK SHOULD PROBABLY BE UNDER A

01:01:29.352 --> 01:01:31.788
PUBLIC SERVICE AGENCY PURVIEW.

01:01:31.854 --> 01:01:34.257
BUT I AM CONCERNED THAT IT DOES

01:01:34.323 --> 01:01:36.426
TAKE THE MEDICAL CONTROL AWAKE

01:01:36.492 --> 01:01:37.593
FROM LOCAL AUTHORITY.

01:01:37.660 --> 01:01:39.996
AM I AM CONCERNED WHICH I DIDN'T

01:01:40.063 --> 01:01:43.499
HEAR YESTERDAY S. ABOUT AS THE

01:01:43.566 --> 01:01:44.667
THE PATCHWORK SCENARIO WHERE THE

01:01:44.734 --> 01:01:46.135
CITY FIRE DEPARTMENT BILL TO

01:01:46.202 --> 01:01:47.303
DISPATCH FOR LEASE COUNTY

01:01:47.370 --> 01:01:48.471
OUTSIDE THE REAL COUNTY AREA

01:01:48.538 --> 01:01:49.705
SUBJECT.

01:01:49.772 --> 01:01:51.007
TO NOT THE SAME THINGS BUT MY%

01:01:51.074 --> 01:01:52.542
UNDERSTANDING IS IT

01:01:52.608 --> 01:01:54.444
SIMULTANEOUSLY TO AND IS THAT

01:01:54.510 --> 01:01:55.912
NOT CORRECT.

01:01:55.978 --> 01:01:58.815
SO WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHEN

01:01:58.881 --> 01:02:00.116
THE CALL COMES IN WE'RE A HOW

01:02:00.183 --> 01:02:01.551

01:02:02.318 --> 01:02:03.219
GHOST OF POLICE DEPARTMENT IS

01:02:03.286 --> 01:02:04.754

THAT INFORMATION TO OUR DISPATCH

01:02:13.029 --> 01:02:15.231
CENTER WE HAVE THE SAME LEVEL OF

01:02:15.298 --> 01:02:17.300
A DISPATCH PROCESS AS THE OTHER

01:02:17.366 --> 01:02:19.335
COUNTY DOES-- BUT WE DON'T GET

01:02:19.402 --> 01:02:21.037
THE LIVE COLOR WHICH GIVES US

01:02:21.104 --> 01:02:22.071
THE INABILITY TO HAVE THAT

01:02:22.138 --> 01:02:24.740
SOMETIMES PERTINENT INFORMATION

01:02:24.807 --> 01:02:26.676
DURING OUR RESPONSE -- WITHOUT

01:02:26.742 --> 01:02:30.113
HAVING THAT -- THAT LIVE COLOR

01:02:30.179 --> 01:02:32.148
IT REALLY AT IT IF IT.

01:02:32.215 --> 01:02:33.049
TAKES AWAY OUR ABILITY TO

01:02:33.116 --> 01:02:33.716
PROVIDE THE BEST SERVICES SOME

01:02:33.783 --> 01:02:35.351
OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE

01:02:35.418 --> 01:02:36.519
POPULATIONS.

01:02:36.586 --> 01:02:38.521
WE COULD DISPATCH RIGHT NOW FOR

01:02:38.588 --> 01:02:40.156
THE ENTIRE COUNTY FTP BUT AT

01:02:40.223 --> 01:02:41.924
THIS TIME BY PROCESS WE DON'T

01:02:41.991 --> 01:02:43.693
HAVE THAT AUTHORITY NOW WE DO

01:02:43.759 --> 01:02:45.495
STILL FALL UNDER MEDICAL FORTY

01:02:45.561 --> 01:02:48.030
UNDER OUR TO PLAN FOR EMS UNDER

01:02:48.097 --> 01:02:50.233
OUR DISPATCH SYSTEM WE REPORT.

01:02:50.299 --> 01:02:51.501
ANYTIME THAT WE HAVE EM D. TYPE

01:02:51.567 --> 01:02:52.768
CALLS ARE CALLS FOR SERVICE THAT

01:02:52.835 --> 01:02:55.071
REQUIRE EMS RESPONSE REPORT THAT

01:02:55.138 --> 01:02:56.472
TO OUR LIVES ARE SO THE SYSTEM

01:02:56.539 --> 01:02:57.607
PROCESS WHEN IT CHANGED THE

01:02:57.673 --> 01:03:01.477
DIFFERENCE WOULD BE.

01:03:01.544 --> 01:03:03.246
WHO HAS THE LIVE CALLER?

01:03:03.312 --> 01:03:05.181
OKAY SO RIGHT NOW LIKE I SAID

01:03:05.248 --> 01:03:07.650
90% OF AT DISPATCHES IS

01:03:07.717 --> 01:03:08.251
CONTROLLED BY AND BY

01:03:08.317 --> 01:03:09.519
FIREFIGHTERS OR PEOPLE IN PUBLIC

01:03:09.585 --> 01:03:11.521
SERVICE RIGHT IT'S FRESNO WHEN A

01:03:11.587 --> 01:03:12.455
FEW EXEMPTIONS.

01:03:12.522 --> 01:03:13.756
UNDER THAT SCENARIO RIGHT NOW

01:03:13.823 --> 01:03:15.291
THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS THAT YOU

01:03:15.358 --> 01:03:17.426
DON'T GET THE LIVE CALL DIRECT

01:03:17.493 --> 01:03:18.828
ANYONE TO LIVE CALL YOU LIKE A

01:03:18.895 --> 01:03:20.163
LOT OF COLOR IN GETTING THE LIVE

01:03:20.229 --> 01:03:21.097
CALL SORRY.

01:03:21.164 --> 01:03:22.865
AND GETTING THE LIVE CALL WILL

01:03:22.932 --> 01:03:24.100
YOU STILL BE UNDER THE MEDICAL

01:03:24.167 --> 01:03:27.470
PER VIEW OF THE COUNTY AUTHORITY

01:03:27.537 --> 01:03:29.639
TO WHERE THEY KNOW WHAT'S GOING

01:03:29.705 --> 01:03:31.407
ON YES HOUSE.

01:03:31.474 --> 01:03:33.643
WE HAVE A MEDICAL DIRECTOR THAT

01:03:33.709 --> 01:03:35.344
OVERSEES ALL MEDICAL OPERATIONS

01:03:35.411 --> 01:03:36.379
WITHIN SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY THEY

01:03:36.445 --> 01:03:38.181
SAID THE POLICY THE PRACTICE

01:03:38.247 --> 01:03:39.182
WHAT TYPE OF AN EMT STRUCTURE WE

01:03:39.248 --> 01:03:39.849
HAVE.

01:03:39.916 --> 01:03:40.783
WHAT TYPE OF THE SYSTEM WE USE

01:03:40.850 --> 01:03:42.785
OUR CABS SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE

01:03:42.852 --> 01:03:43.719
IMPLEMENTED ALL THAT IS UNDER

01:03:43.786 --> 01:03:45.922
THEIR THEIR REGULATION WE REPORT

01:03:45.988 --> 01:03:47.657

SPECIFIC FINDINGS IN REGARDS TO

01:03:49.592 --> 01:03:50.026
EMS?

01:03:50.092 --> 01:03:51.761
SO IT THE THE DIFFERENCE IN THE

01:03:51.827 --> 01:03:52.428
SYSTEM WOULD BE THE LIVE CALL IN

01:03:52.495 --> 01:03:53.296
A LIVE CALL WOULD NOT BE

01:03:53.362 --> 01:03:54.330
TRANSFERRED TRANSFERRED OUT OF

01:03:54.397 --> 01:03:55.765
OUR COUNTY TO A PRIVATE DISPATCH

01:03:55.831 --> 01:03:58.234
CENTER HE LEFT IN OUR COUNTY.

01:03:58.301 --> 01:04:00.036
FOR OUR RESOURCES TO TO BE

01:04:00.102 --> 01:04:03.005
DEPLOYED THEN.

01:04:03.072 --> 01:04:05.141
SO CAN I GET A RESPONSE BECAUSE

01:04:05.208 --> 01:04:06.242
THIS OKAY WE HAVE ALREADY MADE

01:04:06.309 --> 01:04:06.809
IT CLEAR THAT I REALLY THINK

01:04:06.876 --> 01:04:08.578
THAT NINE ONE ONE BELONGS IN A

01:04:08.644 --> 01:04:11.013
PUBLIC AGENCY I DO -- I DO BUT I

01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:12.381
AM VERY VERY CONCERNED ABOUT

01:04:12.448 --> 01:04:14.083
LOCAL CONTROL AND LOSING THAT

01:04:14.150 --> 01:04:15.151
AND ESPECIALLY THE PATCHWORK

01:04:15.218 --> 01:04:17.453
EFFECT BECAUSE I'VE BIG CITIES

01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:19.622
BUT I GOT I GO ALL THE WAY DOWN

01:04:19.689 --> 01:04:21.057
TO THE NEEDLES I GOT A NEEDLE

01:04:21.123 --> 01:04:22.625
THERE IS ON THE BORDER RIGHT AND

01:04:22.692 --> 01:04:23.392
THERE'S OT BIG CITIES DOWN.

01:04:23.459 --> 01:04:24.994
THERE SO I'M VERY CONCERNED

01:04:25.061 --> 01:04:28.698
ABOUT THAT PARTICULAR PIECE --

01:04:28.764 --> 01:04:31.367

01:04:31.434 --> 01:04:32.001
ON BEHALF OF C. SACK AGAIN AND

01:04:32.068 --> 01:04:33.436
THOSE ARE HAT'S THE CORE OF OUR

01:04:33.502 --> 01:04:34.403
CONCERN BECAUSE WE HAVE THE

01:04:34.470 --> 01:04:35.871
COUNTY PERSPECTIVE WE NEED TO

01:04:35.938 --> 01:04:37.540
LOOK AT IT COUNTY WIDE.

01:04:37.607 --> 01:04:39.842
AND CURRENTLY THAT AUTHORITY --

01:04:39.909 --> 01:04:42.144
AND AND KATHLEEN HERE DOCTOR

01:04:42.211 --> 01:04:44.714
CONFIRM IS A MEDICAL DIRECTOR

01:04:44.780 --> 01:04:46.115
AND SO.

01:04:46.182 --> 01:04:47.683
THE THE GENTLEMAN IS CORRECT

01:04:47.750 --> 01:04:48.517
THAT THEY DO SERVE UNDER THE

01:04:48.584 --> 01:04:49.785
MEDICAL CONTROL AND REPORT THESE

01:04:49.852 --> 01:04:51.354
THINGS TO THE COUNTY CURRENTLY

01:04:51.420 --> 01:04:52.788
UNDER THE CURRENT SYSTEM.

01:04:52.855 --> 01:04:53.956
THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW THEM TO

01:04:54.023 --> 01:04:55.157
EXEMPT THEMSELVES FROM THAT AND

01:04:55.224 --> 01:04:57.260
THAT LAST CLAUSE WE MENTIONED IN

01:04:57.326 --> 01:04:58.227
THE CURRENT VERSION OF THE BILL

01:04:58.294 --> 01:04:59.695
MORE OPEN TO TALKING WITH THE

01:04:59.762 --> 01:05:01.130
SPONSORS ABOUT AMENDMENTS --

01:05:01.197 --> 01:05:03.032
ALLOWS OF IF THIS BILL WERE TO

01:05:03.099 --> 01:05:04.166
PASS THE FIRE DEPARTMENT COULD

01:05:04.233 --> 01:05:06.068
SAVE VOLUNTARILY NO WE DON'T

01:05:06.135 --> 01:05:08.104
WANT IT HERE TO THAT -- WE DON'T

01:05:08.170 --> 01:05:09.572
NEED TO WE MAY REPORT SOME

01:05:09.639 --> 01:05:11.040
THINGS OR YOU MAY REPORT ALL BUT

01:05:11.107 --> 01:05:12.141
IT REALLY TAKES WITH THE

01:05:12.208 --> 01:05:13.476
OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY OF

01:05:13.542 --> 01:05:15.011
HAVING A DOCTOR HAVE OVERSIGHT

01:05:15.077 --> 01:05:16.112
ON THE SYSTEM.

01:05:16.178 --> 01:05:18.247
YES MA'AM -- SO ERRORS WILL

01:05:18.314 --> 01:05:19.782
HAPPEN ERRORS DO HAPPEN THEY

01:05:19.849 --> 01:05:21.417
HAPPEN BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE

01:05:21.484 --> 01:05:22.318
DISPATCH.

01:05:22.385 --> 01:05:24.120
AND THE CONCERN IS THAT WHEN

01:05:24.186 --> 01:05:26.489
IT'S BEING DEALT WITH ONLY BY

01:05:26.555 --> 01:05:27.623
THAT ENTITY THAT'S DOING THE

01:05:27.690 --> 01:05:28.858
DISPATCH THAT THAT TRUE

01:05:28.924 --> 01:05:30.726
OVERSIGHT ISN'T HAPPENING WE

01:05:30.793 --> 01:05:32.128
ALREADY HAVE A VERY GOOD --

01:05:32.194 --> 01:05:35.464
OVERSIGHT AND PLEASE INCLUDING --

01:05:35.531 --> 01:05:36.799
AND A LOT OF PLACES THE CMT

01:05:36.866 --> 01:05:38.301
WHERE THE DISPATCHER GIVES

01:05:38.367 --> 01:05:41.604
MEDICAL -- ADVICE TO SOMEONE

01:05:41.671 --> 01:05:43.739
BEFORE THE AMBULANCE I EVEN GETS

01:05:43.806 --> 01:05:45.374
THERE -- WHEN THAT DOESN'T

01:05:45.441 --> 01:05:47.209
HAPPEN APPROPRIATELY THAT'S

01:05:47.276 --> 01:05:48.778
REALLY SOMETHING THAT'S ON THE

01:05:48.844 --> 01:05:50.579
DOCTOR LEVEL THAT I THINK NEEDS

01:05:50.646 --> 01:05:52.248
TO BE INVOLVED IN I AGREE WITH

01:05:52.315 --> 01:05:58.621
YOU THAT THAT'S MY CONCERN?

01:05:58.688 --> 01:06:00.623
I'M ALSO.

01:06:00.690 --> 01:06:01.524
JUST TO SAY WITHIN THE I'M I

01:06:01.590 --> 01:06:02.458
UNDERSTAND THE PUBLIC DISPATCH --

01:06:02.525 --> 01:06:03.225
BUT THE OTHER CONCERN IS THAT

01:06:03.292 --> 01:06:03.959
DOES THIS FRAGMENT TO EACH

01:06:04.026 --> 01:06:06.896
SPECIFIC -- FIRE AGENCY BECAUSE

01:06:06.962 --> 01:06:08.731
STUDIES SHOW OUTSIDE OF THE

01:06:08.798 --> 01:06:10.166
STATE AND EVEN WITHIN THIS -- IN

01:06:10.232 --> 01:06:11.600
IN OTHER COUNTRIES THAT

01:06:11.667 --> 01:06:13.069
CENTRALIZING DISPATCH HELPS THAT

01:06:13.135 --> 01:06:17.106
PATIENT CARE IT HELPS -- THE

01:06:17.173 --> 01:06:18.674
SPEED OF CARE TO GET TO THOSE

01:06:18.741 --> 01:06:20.109
PATIENTS ESPECIALLY IN PATIENTS

01:06:20.176 --> 01:06:22.378
THAT WE KNOW NEED FAST RESPONSES

01:06:22.445 --> 01:06:23.879
CARDIAC ARREST.

01:06:23.946 --> 01:06:25.581
DROWNINGS SEIZURES THEY ALL NEED

01:06:25.648 --> 01:06:27.450
SOMEONE QUICKLY BECAUSE THEY

01:06:27.516 --> 01:06:30.419
NEED MEDICINES AN INTERVENTION --

01:06:30.486 --> 01:06:31.220
ALSO BY PROVIDING DISPATCH

01:06:31.287 --> 01:06:34.290
INSTRUCTIONS -- TO PATIENTS THAT --

01:06:34.357 --> 01:06:35.791
TO SEE THE CALLER FOR SOMEONE IN

01:06:35.858 --> 01:06:37.960
CARDIAC ARREST SIGNIFICANTLY

01:06:38.027 --> 01:06:39.061
INCREASES THE NUMBER OF

01:06:39.128 --> 01:06:40.996
BYSTANDER CPR THAT'S PERFORMED

01:06:41.063 --> 01:06:41.931
IT GOES UP.

01:06:41.997 --> 01:06:43.566
EXPONENTIALLY THERE'S NOT THAT

01:06:43.632 --> 01:06:45.334
MUCH BY SENIOR CPR THAT HAPPENS

01:06:45.401 --> 01:06:46.936
UNLESS A DISPATCHER TELLS THEM

01:06:47.002 --> 01:06:51.040
TO DO IT -- BUT THAT WE ALSO

01:06:51.107 --> 01:06:53.008
KNOW IMPROVE SURVIVAL.

01:06:53.075 --> 01:06:54.477
I I JUST HAVE ONE MORE IT SORRY

01:06:54.543 --> 01:06:56.379
GO AHEAD CHRISTIE SORRY MISS

FROM SORRY THROUGH THE CHAIR IF

01:06:57.847 --> 01:06:58.981
I MAY JUST TWO QUICK POINTS.

01:06:59.048 --> 01:07:00.316
THE COMMITTEE ESTAS TO TAKE

01:07:00.383 --> 01:07:01.650
AMENDMENTS OF THAT VOLUNTARY

01:07:01.717 --> 01:07:04.787
CONSENT IS TO REDUCE SERVICES

01:07:04.854 --> 01:07:06.555
PURSUANT TO THE MEDICAL CONTROL

01:07:06.622 --> 01:07:07.857
POLICIES OF THE COUNTY.

01:07:07.923 --> 01:07:09.191
SO IT'S NOT TOO DOES DO WHATEVER

01:07:09.258 --> 01:07:11.727
THEY WANT IT'S TO DO LESS THAN

01:07:11.794 --> 01:07:12.495
THE OTHER WAS.

01:07:12.561 --> 01:07:14.096
OTHERWISE WOULD DO IN THEIR

01:07:14.163 --> 01:07:15.398
COMMUNITY.

01:07:15.464 --> 01:07:17.566
VOLUNTARILY REDUCING THE SERVICE

01:07:17.633 --> 01:07:18.768
THANK YOU FOR THE RECORD

01:07:18.834 --> 01:07:20.102
RECOMMENDATION AND THAT IS

01:07:20.169 --> 01:07:22.538
EXACTLY WHAT OUR INTENT WAS --

01:07:22.605 --> 01:07:24.173
AND SECONDARILY.

01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:25.040
BUT BY THE BILL SAYING YOU COULD

01:07:25.107 --> 01:07:26.542
ONLY CONTRACT TO ANOTHER PUBLIC

01:07:26.609 --> 01:07:28.411
ENTITY IT IS NOT TAKING THE

01:07:28.477 --> 01:07:29.678
DECISION AWAY FROM THE COUNTY TO

01:07:29.745 --> 01:07:32.314
HOW TO COVER THE ENTIRE COUNTY.

01:07:32.381 --> 01:07:34.683
THEY'RE JUST IT JUST SAYS DON'T

01:07:34.750 --> 01:07:35.818
GIVE IT TO A PRIVATE PROVIDER.

01:07:35.885 --> 01:07:37.753
SO THAT ALL THE COUNTY CAN STILL

01:07:37.820 --> 01:07:39.121
PULL ALL THE FIRE DEPARTMENTS TO

01:07:39.188 --> 01:07:40.990
THE TABLE AND SAY HOW ARE WE

01:07:41.056 --> 01:07:41.991

ARE WE GOING TO MAKE SURE EVERY

01:07:43.392 --> 01:07:45.961
SQUARE MILE IS COVERED AND EVERY

AND THAT'S THAT'S THEIR JOB NOW.

01:07:52.301 --> 01:07:55.004

01:07:55.070 --> 01:07:56.505
THANK YOU KEEP IN PLACE I I HAVE

01:07:56.572 --> 01:07:57.239

I WOULD SAY FOR ENTITIES THAT

DISPATCH IT IS A VERY SIMPLE

01:08:48.691 --> 01:08:50.125
PROCESS FOR ENTITIES THAT MAY

01:08:50.192 --> 01:08:51.527
NOT HAVE EVER DONE IT OR MAYBE

01:08:51.594 --> 01:08:52.862
DON'T HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE I

01:08:52.928 --> 01:08:54.363
THINK THAT THERE WOULD BE A COST.

01:08:54.430 --> 01:08:56.131
AND A TIME FOR THEM TO GET UP TO

01:08:56.198 --> 01:08:57.833
SPEED WE APPRECIATE THE

01:08:57.900 --> 01:08:58.968
INVESTMENTS THAT THE FIRE

01:08:59.034 --> 01:09:00.202
DEPARTMENTS AND OTHER PLACES OF

01:09:00.269 --> 01:09:01.904
MADE IN THE ONES THAT DO HANDLE

DISPATCH FOR US -- BUT I DON'T

01:09:03.606 --> 01:09:05.174
THINK THAT EVERY AT LIKE NEEDLES

01:09:05.241 --> 01:09:06.275
OR OTHER SMALL AREAS OR EVEN

01:09:06.342 --> 01:09:08.811
SMALLER FIRE DISTRICTS WOULD BE

01:09:08.878 --> 01:09:11.213
ABLE TO DO THE DISPATCH PER SE.

01:09:11.280 --> 01:09:12.848
IS THAT YES SIR.

01:09:12.915 --> 01:09:14.216
I'M SORRY I DIDN'T MEAN TO

01:09:14.283 --> 01:09:16.418
INTERRUPT YOU BUT IF I COULD

01:09:16.485 --> 01:09:17.620
JUST ADD TO THAT YOU PART OF OUR

01:09:17.686 --> 01:09:19.221
CONCERN IS NOT THAT YOU CAN

01:09:19.288 --> 01:09:21.323
BUILD A SYSTEM THAT HAS MULTIPLE.

01:09:21.390 --> 01:09:22.958
POINTS OF DISPATCH WITHIN IT BUT

01:09:23.025 --> 01:09:24.527
IT COMPLICATES THE SYSTEM IN A

01:09:24.593 --> 01:09:26.762
MEXICAN THIS IS THE OPPORTUNITY

01:09:26.829 --> 01:09:28.898
TO DROP A CALL AND HAVE A FAILED

01:09:28.964 --> 01:09:31.333
RESPONSE INCREASE WHICH IS ONE

01:09:31.400 --> 01:09:31.934
OF THE REASONS WHY SAN JOAQUIN

01:09:32.001 --> 01:09:32.635
COUNTY.

01:09:32.701 --> 01:09:34.436
CHOSE TO HAVE A SINGLE

01:09:34.503 --> 01:09:37.806
CENTRALIZED DISPATCH CENTER SO

01:09:37.873 --> 01:09:39.141
POSSIBILITY.

01:09:39.208 --> 01:09:40.142
AIR STILL OCCUR NOT SAYING

01:09:40.209 --> 01:09:42.077
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BUT THERE'S

01:09:42.144 --> 01:09:43.112
A WAY OF IDENTIFYING IT IN

01:09:43.178 --> 01:09:46.048
CORRECTING IT UNDER THE MEDICAL

01:09:46.115 --> 01:09:47.249
DIRECTION THE MEDICAL DIRECTOR.

01:09:47.316 --> 01:09:49.051
AND IF THE BILL.

01:09:49.118 --> 01:09:49.952
DOESN'T TAKE AWAY THE MEDICAL

01:09:50.019 --> 01:09:51.720
DIRECTORS AUTHORITY WHICH I

01:09:51.787 --> 01:09:52.555
THINK IT DOES BUT IT'S PLAIN

01:09:52.621 --> 01:09:54.189
READING.

01:09:54.256 --> 01:09:55.457
IF THEY JUST WANT TO PROHIBIT

01:09:55.524 --> 01:09:57.259
CONTRACTING OUT TO TO A PRIVATE

01:09:57.326 --> 01:09:57.927
ENTITY.

01:09:57.993 --> 01:09:59.828
THEN YOU CAN DROP ALL THE

01:09:59.895 --> 01:10:00.663
AMENDMENTS TO HEALTH AND SAFETY

01:10:00.729 --> 01:10:01.230
CODE.

01:10:01.297 --> 01:10:02.264
BECAUSE CHANGING HEALTH AND

01:10:02.331 --> 01:10:03.799
SAFETY CODE IS ABOUT RESTRICTING

01:10:03.866 --> 01:10:05.301
MEDICAL CONTROL.

01:10:05.367 --> 01:10:08.804
SLICE PLAIN PLAIN LANGUAGE

01:10:08.871 --> 01:10:09.104
[inaudible]

01:10:09.171 --> 01:10:11.106
AND SO.

01:10:11.173 --> 01:10:11.740
A CITY CENTER HERTZBERG THAT'S

01:10:11.807 --> 01:10:12.708
RIGHT HAVE A PROBLEM AND I KNOW

01:10:12.775 --> 01:10:13.709
YOU GET THE BILL OUT WITHOUT MY

01:10:13.776 --> 01:10:14.843
THOUGH TO I'M NOT YOU KNOW IT'S

01:10:14.910 --> 01:10:16.345
NOT IT'S NOT THAT BUT I REALLY

01:10:16.412 --> 01:10:17.313
THINK THAT THERE IS.

01:10:17.379 --> 01:10:18.814
AN ISSUE THERE IF IT'S ABOUT

01:10:18.881 --> 01:10:20.649
MAKING SURE THAT A PUBLIC AGENCY

01:10:20.716 --> 01:10:21.917
IS IN CHARGE OF NINE ONE ONE

01:10:21.984 --> 01:10:22.818
THEN LET'S MAKE THE BILL ABOUT A

01:10:22.885 --> 01:10:24.653
PUBLIC AGENCY IN CHARGE OF NINE

01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:26.288
ONE ONE BUT NOT MESS WITH.

01:10:26.355 --> 01:10:27.890
THE LOCAL CONTROL OF MEDICAL

01:10:27.957 --> 01:10:31.093
CONTROL THAT HAS OVERSIGHT -- I

01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:32.227
KNOW MY COUNTY BURSARY

01:10:32.294 --> 01:10:33.996
SPECIFICALLY TO LARRY WAS HERE

01:10:34.063 --> 01:10:34.597
TO OPPOSE IT.

01:10:34.663 --> 01:10:37.032
AND THEY WANT MEDICAL CONTROL

01:10:37.099 --> 01:10:39.401
AND AND I HAD NOT HEARD THE

01:10:39.468 --> 01:10:41.437
PATCHWORK OF PORTION OF IT THAT

01:10:41.503 --> 01:10:42.871
KIND OF BOTHERS ME A LITTLE BIT

01:10:42.938 --> 01:10:43.739
I'M A LITTLE BIT MORE AT EASE

01:10:43.806 --> 01:10:45.274
NOW THAT I KNOW YOU JUST FLIP A

01:10:45.341 --> 01:10:47.409
SWITCH IT GOES TO YOU SO.

01:10:47.476 --> 01:10:47.977
BUT CAN YOU FLIP THE SAME

01:10:48.043 --> 01:10:49.111
SWITCHING GO TO NEEDLES

01:10:49.178 --> 01:10:51.480
CALIFORNIA OR YOU KNOW I DON'T

01:10:51.547 --> 01:10:55.284
KNOW MODESTO MERCED IN OUR RULED

01:10:55.351 --> 01:10:58.854
VALLEY AREAS -- I THINK IT

01:10:58.921 --> 01:10:59.922
SHOULD BE IN THE PUBLIC PURVIEW

01:10:59.989 --> 01:11:01.523
I DO THAT'S ONE THING POLICE

01:11:01.590 --> 01:11:04.460
FIRE AND NINE ONE LINE SHOULD

01:11:04.526 --> 01:11:05.761
DEFINITELY BE IN THE PUBLIC.

01:11:05.828 --> 01:11:08.998
PURVIEW BUT NOT AN I DON'T THINK

01:11:09.064 --> 01:11:10.199
IT I THINK THERE SHOULD BE SOME

01:11:10.265 --> 01:11:11.700
TYPE OF LOCAL CONTROL WITH

01:11:11.767 --> 01:11:12.668
ESPECIALLY THE MEDICAL.

01:11:12.735 --> 01:11:15.504
OVERSIGHT.

01:11:15.571 --> 01:11:17.673
SO THANK YOU FOR ANSWERING THOSE

AMENDMENTS THAT WERE TAKEN THAT

01:11:28.550 --> 01:11:30.052
OUR COMMITTEE WORKED ON WAS FOR

01:11:30.119 --> 01:11:31.520
