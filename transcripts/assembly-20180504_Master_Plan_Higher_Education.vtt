00:12:23.375 --> 00:12:25.344
AWAY FROM ESCAPE THROUGH TWELVE

00:12:25.411 --> 00:12:26.946

ADDITIONAL TRAINING IN PEDAGOGY

00:12:45.064 --> 00:12:45.631

00:12:47.099 --> 00:12:47.600

00:12:59.111 --> 00:13:00.913
THAT APPROACH WAS REJECTED IN

00:14:20.993 --> 00:14:22.928
HOWEVER WE FAILED TO PRIORITIZE

00:14:22.995 --> 00:14:24.997
THE MOST BASIC ASPECT OF

00:14:25.064 --> 00:14:25.664
TEACHING AND LEARNING. WHICH IS

00:14:25.731 --> 00:14:27.166

VALUABLE FOR INSTITUTIONS IT IS

00:14:35.107 --> 00:14:35.574
INSUFFICIENT FOR WHAT OUR

00:14:35.641 --> 00:14:37.343
FACULTY NEED AND BY EXTENSION

00:14:37.409 --> 00:14:38.978
FOR OUR STUDENTS.

00:14:39.044 --> 00:14:41.046
THE STATE CAN ENSURE THE HEALTH

00:14:41.113 --> 00:14:42.848
AND VITALITY OF HIGHER EDUCATION

00:14:42.915 --> 00:14:44.850
BY INVESTING OUR MOST IMPORTANT

WORKING AT OUR COLLEGES

00:14:46.919 --> 00:14:49.255
ONE ACTION THAT WOULD NOT

00:14:49.321 --> 00:14:49.922
REQUIRE ADDITIONAL FUNDING WOULD

00:14:49.989 --> 00:14:51.457
BE TO DESIGNATE A PERCENTAGE OF

OUR BASE FUNDING BE ALLOCATED TO

00:14:53.359 --> 00:14:55.027

00:14:55.094 --> 00:14:56.895
ANOTHER ACTION THAT DOES REQUIRE

00:14:56.962 --> 00:14:59.064
FUNDING NEW FUNDING WOULD BE TO

00:14:59.131 --> 00:14:59.531
FIND THE PROFESSIONAL

COLLEGES AND SURE THAT WE ARE

00:15:07.439 --> 00:15:08.007

00:15:09.008 --> 00:15:11.277
I'D LIKE TO TURN OUR ATTENTION

00:15:11.343 --> 00:15:11.844
NOW TO THE ISSUE OF FACULTY

00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:14.947
DIVERSE.

00:15:15.014 --> 00:15:15.547
THE ACADEMIC SENATE HAS LONG

00:15:15.614 --> 00:15:16.915
BEEN IN SUPPORT OF INCREASING

00:15:16.982 --> 00:15:17.516
THE DIVERSITY OF FACULTY TO

00:15:17.583 --> 00:15:19.285
REFLECT THE DIVERSITY OF OUR

00:15:19.351 --> 00:15:21.186
STUDENT POPULATION. DOING SO IS

00:15:21.253 --> 00:15:22.988
CRITICAL TO IMPROVING THE

00:15:23.055 --> 00:15:23.656
EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE OF ALL OF

00:15:23.722 --> 00:15:24.957

HANDBOOK ON BEST PRACTICES FOR

PROVIDE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT

00:15:39.104 --> 00:15:39.672
WORKSHOPS ON IMPLEMENTING THOSE

00:15:39.738 --> 00:15:39.838
BEST

00:15:39.905 --> 00:15:40.839
SINCE

00:15:40.906 --> 00:15:43.008
WORKSHOPS WERE WELL ATTENDED AND

00:15:43.075 --> 00:15:43.642
RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT CHANGES

00:15:43.709 --> 00:15:44.877
MOST OF OUR COLLEGES.

00:15:44.943 --> 00:15:47.346
THESE CHANGES WERE PUT INTO

00:15:47.413 --> 00:15:49.048
PRACTICE WHEN COLLEGES HIRED

00:15:49.114 --> 00:15:50.949
FULL TIME FACULTY USING A ONE

00:15:51.016 --> 00:15:51.550

POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS A

00:15:53.319 --> 00:15:55.154
COUPLE OF YEARS AGO. WHICH

00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:56.955
RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT INCREASE

00:15:57.022 --> 00:15:57.589
IN UNDER REPRESENTED MINORITIES

00:15:57.656 --> 00:16:00.893
IN FIRST TIME FULL TIME HIRES.

00:16:00.959 --> 00:16:03.362
HOWEVER WE WILL NEVER ACHIEVE

00:16:03.429 --> 00:16:04.963
THE RESULTS WE DESIRE FREE

00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:06.965
CONTINUE RELY ON AN INTERMITTENT

00:16:07.032 --> 00:16:07.599
APPROACH WHEN WE HIRE A GOOD

00:16:07.666 --> 00:16:09.301
NUMBER FACULTY ONE YEAR BUT IN

00:16:09.368 --> 00:16:11.337
OTHER YEARS EVEN WHEN THE STATE

00:16:11.403 --> 00:16:13.372
BUDGET IS STRONG WE RELY ON OUR

00:16:13.439 --> 00:16:15.240
PART TIME FACULTY. AND PERHAPS

00:16:15.307 --> 00:16:17.242
REPLACE THE RETIREMENTS THAT WE

00:16:17.309 --> 00:16:18.944
HAVE.

00:16:19.011 --> 00:16:19.578
WE NEED A SUSTAINED EFFORT THE

00:16:19.645 --> 00:16:21.313
RESOURCES NECESSARY TO MAKE REAL

00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:23.048
PROGRESS.

00:16:23.115 --> 00:16:25.017
AB SEVENTEEN TWENTY FIVE SET A

00:16:25.084 --> 00:16:25.684
GOAL OF SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF

00:16:25.751 --> 00:16:27.286
CREDIT INSTRUCTION TAUGHT BY

00:16:27.353 --> 00:16:28.954
FULL TIME FACULTY.

00:16:29.021 --> 00:16:29.555
CURRENTLY OUR SYSTEM HOVERS

00:16:29.621 --> 00:16:31.390
AROUND THE AN AVERAGE OF FIFTY

00:16:31.457 --> 00:16:33.058
FIVE PERCENT.

00:16:33.125 --> 00:16:35.127
THIS LOW PERCENTAGE OF FULL TIME

00:16:35.194 --> 00:16:35.728
FACULTY HAS SOME VERY REAL

00:16:35.794 --> 00:16:37.229
CONSEQUENCES FOR OUR STUDENTS

00:16:37.296 --> 00:16:39.064
AND OUR COLLEGES.

00:16:39.131 --> 00:16:40.933
HIRING FULL FULL TIME FACULTY

00:16:40.999 --> 00:16:41.533
EVERY YEAR WOULD ALLOW US TO

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:43.202
MAKE PROGRESS ON THE SEVENTY

00:16:43.268 --> 00:16:45.003
FIVE PERCENT GOAL. IMPROVE THE

00:16:45.070 --> 00:16:46.939
DIVERSITY OF THE ACADEMY AND

00:16:47.005 --> 00:16:47.606
PROVIDE THE CRITICAL SUPPORT OUR

00:16:47.673 --> 00:16:49.241
STUDENTS NEED FROM FACULTY OF

00:16:49.308 --> 00:16:51.243
ALL BACKGROUNDS TO ACHIEVE THEIR

00:16:51.310 --> 00:16:52.978
EDUCATIONAL GOALS.

00:16:53.045 --> 00:16:53.645
AND WHEN WE DO HIRE PART TIME

00:16:53.712 --> 00:16:55.414
FACULTY WE NEED TO HONOR THEM AS

00:16:55.481 --> 00:16:57.282
PROFESSIONALS BY ENSURING THAT

00:16:57.349 --> 00:16:59.218
THEY HAVE THE SUPPORT NECESSARY

00:16:59.284 --> 00:16:59.785
TO TEACH OUR DIVERSE BODY OF

00:16:59.852 --> 00:17:00.986
STUDENTS.

00:17:01.053 --> 00:17:03.288
SUPPORT FOR ANY ANY FACULTY

00:17:03.355 --> 00:17:05.357
MEMBER SHOULD INCLUDE OFFICE

00:17:05.424 --> 00:17:07.192
SPACE TO MEET WITH STUDENTS

00:17:07.259 --> 00:17:09.027
ADEQUATE COMPENSATION TO TEACH

00:17:09.094 --> 00:17:10.929
AND SUPPORT STUDENTS SO THAT WE

00:17:10.996 --> 00:17:11.563
DON'T HAVE THIS IDEA FREEWAY

00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:12.898
FLYERS.

00:17:12.965 --> 00:17:15.033
ACCESS TO HEALTH BENEFITS AND

00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:15.534
PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT

00:17:15.601 --> 00:17:16.902
OPPORTUNITIES.

00:17:16.969 --> 00:17:19.204
IMPORTANTLY WE NEED TO RECRUIT

00:17:19.271 --> 00:17:21.106
OUR OWN STUDENTS TO COME BACK

00:17:21.173 --> 00:17:23.008
AND TEACH AT OUR COLLEGES.

00:17:23.075 --> 00:17:23.675
THIS MEANS THAT THERE MUST BE A

00:17:23.742 --> 00:17:25.310
CLEAR PATH FROM THE COMMUNITY

00:17:25.377 --> 00:17:27.379
COLLEGES TO SEE ES UN YOU SEE AS

00:17:27.446 --> 00:17:29.314
WELL AS MENTORING AND PAID

00:17:29.381 --> 00:17:31.016
INTERNSHIP OPPORTUNITIES.

00:17:31.083 --> 00:17:32.985
A CRITICAL COMPONENT IN THAT

00:17:33.051 --> 00:17:35.053
PATHWAY IS SOME ASSURANCE THAT A

00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:36.989
TEACHING POSITION OR SYSTEMS IN

00:17:37.055 --> 00:17:38.924
OBTAINING A POSITION IS AND AS

00:17:38.991 --> 00:17:40.959
AVAILABLE AT THE END OF THE PATH.

00:17:41.026 --> 00:17:41.527
TAKEN TOGETHER THESE THREE

00:17:41.593 --> 00:17:43.295
EFFORTS DEDICATED FUNDING TO

00:17:43.362 --> 00:17:44.930
HIRE FULL TIME FACULTY

00:17:44.997 --> 00:17:47.132
PARITY FOR PART TIME FACULTY AND

00:17:47.199 --> 00:17:49.001
A PATH WE TO TEACHING IN THE

00:17:49.067 --> 00:17:49.535
COMMUNITY COLLEGES. WILL

00:17:49.601 --> 00:17:51.303
ULTIMATELY PROVIDE A SUSTAINABLE

00:17:51.370 --> 00:17:53.005
STRATEGY FOR IMPROVING THE

00:17:53.071 --> 00:17:55.073
DIVERSITY OF OUR FACULTY TO THE

00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:55.707
BENEFIT OF OUR STUDENTS AND OUR

00:17:55.774 --> 00:17:56.975
COLLEGES.

00:17:57.042 --> 00:17:59.278
TEACHING AS AN INTERPERSONAL

00:17:59.344 --> 00:18:00.979
ENDEAVOR.

00:18:01.046 --> 00:18:01.613
FUNDAMENTAL TO ITS SUCCESS IS

00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:03.115
THE CONNECTION BETWEEN FACULTY

00:18:03.182 --> 00:18:04.850
AND STUDENTS

00:18:04.917 --> 00:18:07.186
FACULTY REMINDED DAILY OF THE

00:18:07.252 --> 00:18:07.853
POWER OF THIS CONNECTION IN OUR

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:09.354
LEARNING SPACES BOTH FORMAL AND

00:18:09.421 --> 00:18:11.323
INFORMAL. AND WE ARE DEEPLY

00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:13.325
COGNIZANT OF THE NECESSITY OF

00:18:13.392 --> 00:18:15.294
SUSTAINED INTERACTION BETWEEN

00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:17.196
FACULTY AND STUDENTS AS THE MOST

00:18:17.262 --> 00:18:19.064
MEANINGFUL FACTOR THAT

00:18:19.131 --> 00:18:20.899
CONTRIBUTES TO STUDENT SUCCESS.

00:18:20.966 --> 00:18:23.101
SUPPORTING PROFESSIONAL

00:18:23.168 --> 00:18:23.669
DEVELOPMENT FOR ALL FACULTY

00:18:23.735 --> 00:18:25.204
WHILE IMPROVING THE DIVERSITY

00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:27.339
AND NUMBER OF FULL TIME FACULTY

00:18:27.406 --> 00:18:28.907
ARE COLLEGES WILL ENSURE A

00:18:28.974 --> 00:18:30.976
VIBRANT AND ENGAGING COLLEGE

00:18:31.043 --> 00:18:31.610
COMMUNITY WHERE STUDENTS WILL

00:18:31.677 --> 00:18:33.445
ENJOY A RICH ACADEMIC LIFE ARE

00:18:33.512 --> 00:18:34.913

CONVERTING THESE COURSES IS

00:19:47.019 --> 00:19:47.619
REQUIRED A GREAT DEAL OF FACULTY

00:19:47.686 --> 00:19:49.187

SKILLS GAPS AND HELPING STUDENTS

00:20:29.294 --> 00:20:31.163
TO SUCCEED. CSU FACULTY ARE

00:20:31.229 --> 00:20:33.098
MINDING THE GAP HERE.

00:20:33.165 --> 00:20:35.300
THE NEXT GAP HAS TO DO WITH

00:20:35.367 --> 00:20:35.734
GRADUATION RATES FOR

00:20:35.801 --> 00:20:37.569
HISTORICALLY UNDERSERVED

00:20:37.636 --> 00:20:39.237
POPULATIONS SUCH AS STUDENTS OF

00:20:39.304 --> 00:20:41.607
COLOR SO I'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT

00:20:41.673 --> 00:20:42.274
HOW FACULTY DEVELOPMENT IS HELP.

00:20:42.341 --> 00:20:45.410
CLOSE THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP.

00:20:45.477 --> 00:20:46.979
AS IN A PROFOUND DEVELOPER CALL

00:20:47.045 --> 00:20:49.247
VOLUME PRACTICES WERE HIPS.

00:20:49.314 --> 00:20:50.882
HIPS THINGS LIKE STUDY ABROAD

00:20:50.949 --> 00:20:51.483
SERVICE LEARNING INTERNSHIPS

00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:53.218
LEARNING COMMUNITIES AND THE

00:20:53.285 --> 00:20:55.053
LINK BETWEEN HIPS AND

00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:55.721
ACHIEVEMENT GAPS CAN BE SEEN IN

00:20:55.787 --> 00:20:58.957
EXAMPLES LIKE CSU NORTHRIDGE WHO

00:20:59.024 --> 00:21:00.959
REPORT THAT LATINO STUDENTS ARE

00:21:01.026 --> 00:21:03.095
TEN PERCENT MORE LIKELY THAN

00:21:03.161 --> 00:21:03.762
THEIR PEERS. TO EARN A BACHELORS

00:21:03.829 --> 00:21:06.898
DEGREE IF THEY DO JUST ONE HIP

00:21:06.965 --> 00:21:09.067
AND IF THEY DO MORE THAN ONE THE

00:21:09.134 --> 00:21:10.936
EFFECT IS CUMULATIVE.

00:21:11.003 --> 00:21:11.570
BUT THERE'S A BIG HOBBY I HEAR

00:21:11.637 --> 00:21:13.105
QUALITY MATTERS AND FACULTY

00:21:13.171 --> 00:21:15.073
DEVELOPMENT MATTERS BECAUSE

00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:16.975
THAT'S HOW YOU GET THE QUALITY.

00:21:17.042 --> 00:21:17.609
THERE WAS A STUDY PUBLISHED IN

00:21:17.676 --> 00:21:19.111
THE JOURNAL OF HIGHER EDUCATION

00:21:19.177 --> 00:21:21.046
WHICH SAID OFFERING JUST

00:21:21.113 --> 00:21:21.580
OFFERING AND LABELING AND

00:21:21.647 --> 00:21:23.382
ACTIVITY AS A HIP. DOESN'T

00:21:23.448 --> 00:21:25.350
GUARANTEE STUDENTS WILL BENEFIT

00:21:25.417 --> 00:21:27.352
FROM IT WHAT IS EFFECTIVE IS

00:21:27.419 --> 00:21:29.287
SUPPORTING FACULTY DEVELOPMENT

00:21:29.354 --> 00:21:29.855
TO MAKE THEM HIGH QUALITY

00:21:29.921 --> 00:21:31.156
EXPERIENCES AND THEN THEY CAN

00:21:31.223 --> 00:21:33.358
REALLY MOVE THE NEEDLE ON THE

00:21:33.425 --> 00:21:33.759
ACHIEVEMENT GAP.

00:21:33.825 --> 00:21:35.427
SO AGAIN REMINDING THE GAP ON

00:21:35.494 --> 00:21:37.062
STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT BY DEVOTING

00:21:37.129 --> 00:21:39.297
RESOURCES TO HELPING FACULTY

00:21:39.364 --> 00:21:40.999
DEVELOP HIGH QUALITY HIPS.

00:21:41.066 --> 00:21:42.968
WE'RE ALSO PAYING CLOSE

00:21:43.035 --> 00:21:45.370
ATTENTION TO COMPLETION GAPS

00:21:45.437 --> 00:21:46.038
WHAT WE WANNA SEE IS THAT WHEN A

00:21:46.104 --> 00:21:47.439
STUDENT ENTERS THE INNER CITY

00:21:47.506 --> 00:21:49.207
THAT PERSON.

00:21:49.274 --> 00:21:51.410
WHATEVER PAYS FOR THAT.

00:21:51.476 --> 00:21:52.878
WE'D RATHER NOT SEE THEM STOP

00:21:52.944 --> 00:21:53.545
AND WE CERTAINLY DON'T PERCEIVE

00:21:53.612 --> 00:21:54.913
ROB.

00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:57.015
SO WE LOOK FOR.

00:21:57.082 --> 00:21:57.549
YOU CAN PERSISTENCE RATES

00:21:57.616 --> 00:21:59.117
WHICH ULTIMATELY CLOSES

00:21:59.184 --> 00:22:01.019
COMPLETION GAPS.

00:22:01.086 --> 00:22:03.221
ONE KEY REASON WHY STUDENTS

00:22:03.288 --> 00:22:03.789
MIGHT NOT STICK WITH THEIR

00:22:03.855 --> 00:22:05.390
EDUCATION IS COST INCLUDING THE

00:22:05.457 --> 00:22:07.025
COST OF TEXTBOOKS.

00:22:07.092 --> 00:22:09.094
SO THERE FACULTY DEVELOPMENT

I'VE TALKED ABOUT TODAY COSTS

00:24:09.648 --> 00:24:11.750
MONEY BUT LEAVE THE LAST COUNT

00:24:11.817 --> 00:24:13.118
GONNA TALK ABOUT. THAT THE GAP

00:24:13.185 --> 00:24:15.153
BETWEEN THE AMOUNT OF STATE

00:24:15.220 --> 00:24:17.155
FUNDING WE. AND THE AMOUNT OF

00:24:17.222 --> 00:24:17.689
MONEY WE NEED TO OPERATE.

00:24:17.756 --> 00:24:19.291
ALL OF THE INITIATIVES I'VE

00:24:19.357 --> 00:24:21.026
TALKED ABOUT ART FREE AND YOU

00:24:21.092 --> 00:24:23.028
GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR.

00:24:23.094 --> 00:24:23.595
AS YOU KNOW THE GOVERNOR'S

00:24:23.662 --> 00:24:25.163
PROPOSED BUDGET BARELY COVERS A

00:24:25.230 --> 00:24:27.132
THIRD OF OUR NEED AND DOESN'T

00:24:27.199 --> 00:24:29.000
EVEN COVER OUR BASIC OUR MOST

00:24:29.067 --> 00:24:29.501
BASIC MANDATORY COSTS.

00:24:29.568 --> 00:24:31.303
IT ALSO DOESN'T FUND THE

00:24:31.369 --> 00:24:33.071
GRADUATION INITIATIVE WHICH IS

00:24:33.138 --> 00:24:35.240
THE LYNCH PIN OF SO MUCH OF WHAT

00:24:35.307 --> 00:24:35.774
I'VE TALKED ABOUT TODAY.

00:24:35.841 --> 00:24:37.375
WE BUILT UP A LOT OF MOMENTUM

00:24:37.442 --> 00:24:39.110
WITH THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE

00:24:39.177 --> 00:24:41.012
WITHOUT FULL FUNDING THAT

00:24:47.118 --> 00:24:49.020
THIS WOULD BE A TIME WHEN STATE

00:24:49.087 --> 00:24:49.654
RESERVES ARE HUGE IN THE RAINY

00:24:49.721 --> 00:24:51.022

00:24:51.089 --> 00:24:52.991
A FIVE LOGIC.

00:24:53.058 --> 00:24:55.227

00:25:05.036 --> 00:25:07.105
IMPERATIVE THAT THE STATE SHOULD

EDUCATE ITS CITIZENRY.

00:25:09.074 --> 00:25:09.541

IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEIR MISSION.

00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:15.680
THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE STATE

00:25:15.747 --> 00:25:17.315
IN TURN IS TO PROVIDE THE

00:25:17.382 --> 00:25:19.417

OF COURSE EVERY CAMPUS HAS ITS

00:32:17.068 --> 00:32:19.237
REMEDIATION GENERALLY IF YOU SEE

00:32:19.304 --> 00:32:21.272
WE DO NOT OFFER REMEDIAL COURSES

00:32:21.339 --> 00:32:23.074
INSTEAD WE DO THINK TWO THINGS

00:32:23.141 --> 00:32:24.976
MORE IMPORTANT I THINK IN BETTER

00:32:25.043 --> 00:32:26.978
ONE IS WE TRY TO ENSURE. THAT

00:32:27.045 --> 00:32:28.980
OUR STUDENTS HAVE EXCELLENT

00:32:29.047 --> 00:32:29.614
PREPARATION COMING IN EXAMPLE

00:32:29.681 --> 00:32:31.182
WOULD BE WORKING WITH OUR

00:32:31.249 --> 00:32:33.384
PARTNERS TO CREATE AND UPDATE

00:32:33.451 --> 00:32:34.919
THE ATG CURRICULUM.

00:32:34.986 --> 00:32:37.322
ANOTHER ONE WOULD BE THE ENTRY

00:32:37.388 --> 00:32:38.990
LEVEL WRITING REQUIREMENT YELL

00:32:39.057 --> 00:32:40.925
W. ARE.

00:32:40.992 --> 00:32:41.492
SO WE TRY TO MAKE SURE THE

00:32:41.559 --> 00:32:42.960
STUDENTS ARE WELL PREPARED TO

00:32:43.027 --> 00:32:43.594
COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY WHEN THEY

00:32:43.661 --> 00:32:44.929
ARISE.

00:32:44.996 --> 00:32:47.231
IF THEY'RE NOT INSTEAD OF SAYING

00:32:47.298 --> 00:32:48.933
STOP AND HOLDING THEM UP.

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:51.302
UP FOR REMEDIATION WE DO

00:32:51.369 --> 00:32:51.669
SOMETHING ELSE.

00:32:51.736 --> 00:32:53.037
WE DO.

00:32:53.104 --> 00:32:55.340
HAVE A COLLEGE LEVEL INTENSIVE

00:32:55.406 --> 00:32:56.941

00:32:59.677 --> 00:33:00.978
PROGRESS.

00:33:01.045 --> 00:33:01.312
SO THAT IS.

00:33:01.379 --> 00:33:03.414
ARE ALTERNATIVE APPROACH TO

00:33:03.481 --> 00:33:06.984
REMEDIATION.

00:33:07.051 --> 00:33:09.053

BUT. WE.

00:33:11.155 --> 00:33:12.990
GENERATE.

00:33:13.057 --> 00:33:15.460
MORE THAN TWENTY PERCENT OF THE

00:33:15.526 --> 00:33:17.295

00:33:26.971 --> 00:33:29.006
WHAT CAN WE DO?

00:33:29.073 --> 00:33:31.075
ALL THE LOW HANGING FRUIT HAVE

00:33:31.142 --> 00:33:31.709
ALREADY BEEN PICKED THERE'S NOT

00:33:31.776 --> 00:33:33.544
MUCH THAT WE CAN DO THAT WON'T

00:33:33.611 --> 00:33:35.012
REQUIRE MORE FUNDING.

00:33:35.079 --> 00:33:39.016
OUR REAL PROBLEM IS.

00:33:39.083 --> 00:33:41.285

00:33:47.492 --> 00:33:49.494
WE USE THE WHERE APPEARS THERE

A DECADE AGO ONE NOT ANY MORE

00:33:50.962 --> 00:33:54.932

00:34:21.459 --> 00:34:23.227
THIS IS ONLY IN SCHOOL BEING

THE SUPPORT YOU CAN SEE IN THE

00:34:39.277 --> 00:34:39.777
WAY IS THAT WE DEVELOP OUR

00:36:25.416 --> 00:36:27.051
LITTLE BIT ABOUT A KILLJOY ABOUT

00:36:27.118 --> 00:36:28.986

WROTE AN ARTICLE IN NINETEEN

00:36:35.927 --> 00:36:37.328
SEVENTY EIGHT EIGHTEEN YEARS

00:36:37.395 --> 00:36:39.130

WRITTEN THIS IS WHAT HE SAYS.

00:36:40.965 --> 00:36:44.969
HE CONSIDERS IN RETROSPECT THE

00:36:45.036 --> 00:36:45.603
VAST EXPANSION OF THE COMMUNITY

00:36:45.670 --> 00:36:48.940

IDEA OF THE FIRST LINE OF

00:37:05.590 --> 00:37:06.924
DEFENSE.

00:37:06.991 --> 00:37:08.993
IT MEANS THAT THE MASTER PLAN

00:37:09.060 --> 00:37:11.262
WAS DESIGNED TO BLOCK THE VAST

00:37:11.329 --> 00:37:13.364
MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIANS FROM

THAT IT GET.

00:37:27.044 --> 00:37:27.578
AND TODAY THOSE RESULTS HAVE

00:37:27.645 --> 00:37:30.982
RACIAL IMPLICATION.

00:37:31.048 --> 00:37:31.449

I AM HERE TODAY TO TALK ABOUT

00:38:07.418 --> 00:38:08.953
WHAT OUR CENTER IS DOING IN THE

00:38:09.020 --> 00:38:10.921
AREA OF PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT.

00:38:10.988 --> 00:38:11.489

FACULTY OF COLOR ENHANCE THE

00:41:15.639 --> 00:41:17.441
SENSE OF BELONGING THAT STUDENTS

THEIR FACULTY HIRING PROCESS YOU.

00:41:38.996 --> 00:41:40.898
TEAMS OF TEN LOOK AT DATA ABOUT

00:41:40.965 --> 00:41:43.033
HOW CANDIDATES PROCEED THROUGH

00:41:43.100 --> 00:41:43.701
THE HIRING PROCESS AND THEY ARE

00:41:43.767 --> 00:41:45.536
NOT BY THE PRECISE POINTS WHEN A

00:41:45.603 --> 00:41:48.939
POOL BECOMES LESS DIVERSE.

00:41:49.006 --> 00:41:49.607
THEY LOOK INTO THE LANGUAGE OF

00:41:49.673 --> 00:41:51.375
THEIR JOB ANNOUNCEMENTS AND SEE

00:41:51.442 --> 00:41:53.177
HOW THEIR COLLEGE IS PRESENTING

00:41:53.244 --> 00:41:55.145
THEIR VALUES AROUND RACIAL

00:41:55.212 --> 00:41:56.947
EQUITY TO POTENTIAL HIRES.

00:41:57.014 --> 00:42:01.418
THE TEAMS WORK TOGETHER TO LEARN

00:42:01.485 --> 00:42:03.087
ABOUT IMPLICIT BIAS AND TO BUILD

00:42:03.153 --> 00:42:03.888
INTERPERSONAL STRATEGIES TO

00:42:03.954 --> 00:42:07.091
DISRUPT EXPLICIT BIAS WHEN IT

00:42:07.157 --> 00:42:07.658
EMERGES IN HIRING COMMITTEE

00:42:07.725 --> 00:42:07.925
MEETING.

00:42:07.992 --> 00:42:09.593
WE ARE ALREADY SEEING WIDESPREAD

00:42:09.660 --> 00:42:11.328
CHANGES AND JOB ANNOUNCEMENTS

00:42:11.395 --> 00:42:13.097
USED ACROSS THE STATE AFTER ONE

00:42:13.163 --> 00:42:13.631
YEAR OF ENGAGING IN THIS

00:42:13.697 --> 00:42:15.065
IMPORTANT WORK.

00:42:15.132 --> 00:42:17.301
THIS IS ONE EXAMPLE OF OUR

00:42:17.368 --> 00:42:17.968
METHODOLOGY FOR FOR PROFESSIONAL

00:42:18.035 --> 00:42:19.069
DEVELOPMENT.

00:42:19.136 --> 00:42:21.405
WE CONVENE FACULTY FROM ACROSS

00:42:21.472 --> 00:42:23.173
CAMPUS AREAS TO ENGAGE DEEPLY

00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:24.875
AND DISCUSSIONS OF RACIAL EQUITY.

00:42:24.942 --> 00:42:27.378
THEY BECOME RESEARCHERS INTO

00:42:27.444 --> 00:42:29.146
THEIR OWN PRACTICE AND CHANGE

00:42:29.213 --> 00:42:31.248
AGENTS WILLING TO ADVOCATE FOR

00:42:31.315 --> 00:42:31.815
THEIR RACIALLY MINORITY HIGH

00:42:31.882 --> 00:42:32.983
STUDENTS.

00:42:33.050 --> 00:42:35.319
TO CONCLUDE I WONDER RESTATE THE

00:42:35.386 --> 00:42:36.854
IMPORTANCE OF FACULTY

00:42:36.921 --> 00:42:37.454
DEVELOPMENT OUTSIDE OF THEIR

00:42:37.521 --> 00:42:39.023
SUBJECT AREAS.

00:42:39.089 --> 00:42:41.225
THE STATE SHOULD BE FUNDING MORE

00:42:41.292 --> 00:42:43.127
PROGRAMMING FOR FACULTY TO COME

00:42:43.193 --> 00:42:45.229
TOGETHER AND LEARN HOW TO BRING

00:42:45.296 --> 00:42:45.896
CRITICAL RACE CONSCIOUSNESS INTO

00:42:45.963 --> 00:42:47.031
THEIR PRACTICE.

00:42:47.097 --> 00:42:49.366
ONE ACTION THE STATE CAN TAKE

00:42:49.433 --> 00:42:51.335
THAT DOES NOT REQUIRE FUNDING IS

00:42:51.402 --> 00:42:52.970
TO SHIFT THE LANGUAGE THAT WE

00:42:53.037 --> 00:42:55.039
USE AROUND ACHIEVEMENT VERSES

00:42:55.105 --> 00:42:56.941
OPPORTUNITY GAPS.

00:42:57.007 --> 00:42:57.641
WE CANNOT BEGIN TO TALK ABOUT IN

00:42:57.708 --> 00:42:59.376
ACHIEVEMENT GAP UNTIL WE ENSURE

00:42:59.443 --> 00:43:02.913
THAT ALL OF OUR STUDENTS DO HAVE

00:43:02.980 --> 00:43:03.480
EQUAL OPPORTUNITY TO HIGHER

00:43:03.547 --> 00:43:05.049
EDUCATION.

00:43:05.115 --> 00:43:07.251
IT IS CRUCIAL THAT WE STOP

00:43:07.318 --> 00:43:08.919
TALKING ABOUT THE ACHIEVEMENT

00:43:08.986 --> 00:43:10.921
GAP AS A PROBLEM OF STUDENT

00:43:10.988 --> 00:43:11.388
MOTIVATION OR STUDENT

00:43:11.455 --> 00:43:14.992
PREPARATION. AND INSIST IN NO

00:43:15.059 --> 00:43:15.526
UNCERTAIN TERMS THAT OUR

00:43:15.592 --> 00:43:17.261
INSTITUTIONS ARE THE SOURCE OF

00:43:17.328 --> 00:43:17.828
THE INEQUITIES THAT WE ARE

00:43:17.895 --> 00:43:18.963
SEEING.

00:43:19.029 --> 00:43:22.933
THIS REFRAMING HAS CHIU BENEFITS

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:23.567
THE FIRST IS TO ACKNOWLEDGE AND

00:43:23.634 --> 00:43:24.969
ATTEMPT TO CORRECT.

00:43:25.035 --> 00:43:27.204
MANY CENTURIES OF GOVERNMENT

00:43:27.271 --> 00:43:29.106
SPONSORED EDUCATIONAL INJUSTICE

FROM JIM CROW SEGREGATION TO

NATIVE AMERICAN BOARDING SCHOOLS

00:43:33.143 --> 00:43:34.878
FOR LANGUAGE ERADICATION.

00:43:34.945 --> 00:43:37.047
THE SECOND BENEFIT IS TO RE

00:43:37.114 --> 00:43:39.049
FRAME EDUCATIONAL INEQUITY AS A

00:43:39.116 --> 00:43:41.151
PROBLEM OF PRACTICE WITHIN THE

00:43:41.218 --> 00:43:41.719
SPHERE OF INFLUENCE OF OUR

00:43:41.785 --> 00:43:42.987

00:43:43.053 --> 00:43:44.888
A PROBLEM WITH A SOLUTION.

00:43:44.955 --> 00:43:47.191
THAT WE CAN ACHIEVE THROUGH

00:43:47.257 --> 00:43:47.758
REFLECTION AND PROFESSIONAL

00:43:47.825 --> 00:43:48.892
LEARNING.

00:43:48.959 --> 00:43:51.195
WE WILL NOT ACHIEVE THE AIMS OF

00:43:51.261 --> 00:43:52.896
A JUST AND EQUITABLE SYSTEM

00:43:52.963 --> 00:43:55.065
WITHOUT DISMANTLING OUR

00:43:55.132 --> 00:43:55.666
EUPHEMISTIC LANGUAGE AROUND

00:43:55.733 --> 00:43:57.034
RACIAL INJUSTICE.

00:43:57.101 --> 00:43:58.969
CHALLENGING OUR MYTHS OF

00:51:51.708 --> 00:51:53.376
BUT THE NOTION THAT THESE

00:51:53.443 --> 00:51:55.178
INSTITUTIONS ARE COLEGIO

00:51:55.245 --> 00:51:57.214
INSTITUTIONS AND THEY ARE. THAT

00:51:57.280 --> 00:51:59.149
ARE RUN BY FACULTY. THAT THE

00:51:59.216 --> 00:52:01.117
ISSUES OF CURRICULUM AND HIRING

00:52:01.184 --> 00:52:03.353
AND THOSE KINDS OF THINGS GOAL

00:52:03.420 --> 00:52:03.720
TO THE FACULTY.

00:52:03.787 --> 00:52:05.355
I AND HAVING BEEN IN THAT SYSTEM

00:52:05.422 --> 00:52:07.023
IN THOSE POSITIONS OF PERSONAL.

00:52:07.090 --> 00:52:09.259
OWN PERSONAL COMMITTEES AND

00:52:09.326 --> 00:52:10.894
WHAT HAVE BEEN HIRING THINGS

00:52:10.961 --> 00:52:13.196
THAT IS TRUE. SO FROM YOUR

00:52:13.263 --> 00:52:15.165
PERSPECTIVE AS CHEERS OF THESE

00:52:15.232 --> 00:52:17.000
ACADEMIC IS SENATE'S WHICH

00:52:17.067 --> 00:52:19.035
EVERYBODY PAYS HOW MUCH DO. I

00:52:19.102 --> 00:52:21.071
SERVE IN ACADEMICS AND SO I

00:52:21.137 --> 00:52:23.306
DON'T PAY AS MUCH HOW MUCH AS

00:52:23.373 --> 00:52:25.041
EVERYBODY ELSE.

00:52:25.108 --> 00:52:25.609
IT SIX OR SEVEN YEARS I CAN

00:52:25.675 --> 00:52:27.043
REMEMBER LAW PART OF MY.

00:52:27.110 --> 00:52:29.079
SEEM LIKE ON ACADEMIC SENATE.

00:52:29.145 --> 00:52:31.214
SO WHAT DO YOU. WHAT DO YOU SEE

00:52:31.281 --> 00:52:33.450
AS OTHER THAN FUNDING BECAUSE AT

00:52:33.517 --> 00:52:34.985
DEFINING WHAT THE KEY I'D

00:52:35.051 --> 00:52:35.585
PROBABLY GO FIND THE MONEY FOR

00:52:35.652 --> 00:52:36.953
YOU BUT?

00:52:37.020 --> 00:52:39.189
WHAT DO YOU SEE AS THE KEY TO?

00:52:39.256 --> 00:52:42.959
CHANGING THE DYNAMICS.

00:52:43.026 --> 00:52:44.928
OF ALL OF THESE INSTITUTIONS

00:52:44.995 --> 00:52:47.163
AROUND THE ISSUE OF HIRING AND

00:52:47.230 --> 00:52:49.165
RESEARCH WAS EVEN THOUGH WE CAN

00:52:49.232 --> 00:52:49.366
SAY.

00:52:49.432 --> 00:52:51.468
THE ACTIVITIES YOU ENGAGE IN

00:52:51.535 --> 00:52:53.403
FOR DIVERSITY OR WHATEVER SHOULD

00:52:53.470 --> 00:52:54.971
COUNT LIKE THE OTHERS.

00:52:55.038 --> 00:52:57.407
ANYBODY IN ITS INSTITUTION KNOWS

00:52:57.474 --> 00:53:01.011
IS A VERY BEAUTIFUL WORDS.

00:53:01.077 --> 00:53:01.511
BUT IN THOSE PERSONNEL

00:53:01.578 --> 00:53:03.013
COMMITTEES WHAT I'VE SAID.

00:53:03.079 --> 00:53:05.248
I PEOPLE SAY YES IT'S WONDERFUL

00:53:05.315 --> 00:53:07.050
THAT THEY'VE GONE OUT AND AND

00:53:07.117 --> 00:53:08.985
RESCUE ALL THESE KIDS OF THEIR

00:53:09.052 --> 00:53:09.553
WORKING WITH THEM IN THERE

00:53:09.619 --> 00:53:10.887
HELPING THEM TO BE SUCCESSFUL

00:53:10.954 --> 00:53:11.154
HOWEVER.

00:53:11.221 --> 00:53:13.390
THEY SHOULD OF DONE ONE MORE

00:53:13.456 --> 00:53:13.657
ARTICLE.

00:53:13.723 --> 00:53:17.193
AND SO THEY DID TO THE GUY WHO

00:53:17.260 --> 00:53:19.029
DID NOTHING THE A THREE.

00:53:19.095 --> 00:53:19.729
AND THE THREE GETS PROMOTED INTO

00:53:19.796 --> 00:53:23.033
A NEED AND A TWO PERSON GETS A A

00:53:23.099 --> 00:53:23.700
A SAY YOU KNOW YOU NEED TO GET

00:53:23.767 --> 00:53:25.302
ENOUGH ARTICLE AND BLAH BLAH

00:53:25.368 --> 00:53:27.203
BLAH AND SO. IN SOME SMALL WAY.

00:53:27.270 --> 00:53:29.472
AND WHICH IS REALLY LARGE OF

00:53:29.539 --> 00:53:31.374
THE EMPHASIS IS IS SAID AND IN

00:53:31.441 --> 00:53:33.410
MANY WAYS IT THIS IS UNIMPORTANT

00:53:33.476 --> 00:53:34.945
IN THE REAL WORLD.

00:53:35.011 --> 00:53:37.080
AND THE WORLD OF TENURE

00:53:37.147 --> 00:53:39.049
PROMOTION AND RESOURCES WORKING

00:53:39.115 --> 00:53:41.051
WITH THESE POPULATIONS IS NOT

00:53:41.117 --> 00:53:42.953
THAT IMPORTANT.

00:53:43.019 --> 00:53:45.155
IT'S IMPORTANT BUT IT'S NOT

00:53:45.221 --> 00:53:47.123
BECAUSE IT DOESN'T COUNT IN IN

00:53:47.190 --> 00:53:48.959
IN TERMS OF HOUSEHOLDS CAN.

00:53:49.025 --> 00:53:49.626
FOLKS IN WHO THEY CELEBRATE WITH

00:53:49.693 --> 00:53:51.494
A LOT WHEN THEY BECOME THE DEAN

00:53:51.561 --> 00:53:53.296
WHO BECOMES WHATEVER ELSE THAT

00:53:53.363 --> 00:53:55.131
USED TO BE WE KNOW WHO GETS THAT

00:53:55.198 --> 00:53:56.967
SO HOW DO WE CHANGE THAT.

00:53:57.033 --> 00:53:57.367
AS YOU FOLKS ARE.

00:53:57.434 --> 00:53:59.402
SHARES OF THE ACADEMIC SENATE.

00:53:59.469 --> 00:54:01.338
WHICH ACCORDING TO AND BEING

00:54:01.404 --> 00:54:03.306
TOLD VALUE PRESIDENTS AND

00:54:03.373 --> 00:54:04.975
CHANCELLORS THAT IF YOU FOLKS

00:54:05.041 --> 00:54:07.110
SAID IT WOULD HAPPEN. THAT'S

00:54:07.177 --> 00:54:08.979
WHAT THEY TELL US WHICH I KNOW

00:54:09.045 --> 00:54:10.880
THAT'S NOT ALWAYS TRUE EITHER

00:54:10.947 --> 00:54:11.581
BUT WHAT WOULD YOU WHAT WHAT DO

00:54:11.648 --> 00:54:13.583
I MEAN WHAT CAN WE DO TO CHANGE

00:54:13.650 --> 00:54:15.418
THAT DYNAMIC BECAUSE EVERYBODY

00:54:15.485 --> 00:54:16.019
KIND OF SHIFTS THAT EVERYBODY

00:54:16.086 --> 00:54:16.920
ELSE.

00:54:16.987 --> 00:54:17.487
NO WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO

00:54:17.554 --> 00:54:19.389
FIGURING OUT HOW YOU GONNA MOVE

00:54:19.456 --> 00:54:21.224
THESE INSTITUTIONS TO TO REALLY

00:54:21.291 --> 00:54:22.959
OPEN UP TO THE POPULATION OF

00:54:23.026 --> 00:54:25.261
STUDENTS WERE HERE. AND TO MAKE

00:54:25.328 --> 00:54:27.063
A DIFFERENCE IN CALIFORNIA ARE

00:54:27.130 --> 00:54:29.299
WHAT WHAT WHAT. IF THERE WAS ONE

00:54:29.366 --> 00:54:31.101
THING YOU COULD THINK ABOUT THAT

00:54:31.167 --> 00:54:31.735
WOULD CHANGE IT WHAT WOULD IT BE

00:54:31.801 --> 00:54:33.036
SINCE.

00:54:33.103 --> 00:54:33.703
LIKE I SAID YOU GUYS AT YEARS OF

00:54:33.770 --> 00:54:39.042
ACADEMIC SENATE.

00:54:39.109 --> 00:54:39.242
WELL.

00:54:39.309 --> 00:54:41.344
THANK YOU I WISH THAT WE DID

00:54:41.411 --> 00:54:43.380
HAVE THE POWER THAT YOU THOUGHT

00:54:43.446 --> 00:54:45.215
AND YOU HAVE.

00:54:45.281 --> 00:54:47.350
AND I THANK YOU FOR YOUR YEARS

00:54:47.417 --> 00:54:48.952
OF SERVICE.

00:54:49.019 --> 00:54:50.954
.

00:54:51.021 --> 00:54:53.356
I I SEE A A COUPLE OF COMMENTS

00:54:53.423 --> 00:54:55.458
ONE IS IT'S A CHICKEN AND EGG

00:54:55.525 --> 00:54:56.960
SITUATION.

00:54:57.027 --> 00:54:59.362
WE'VE GOT TO DO BETTER WITH THE

00:54:59.429 --> 00:55:00.964
PIPELINE.

00:55:01.031 --> 00:55:02.966
THAT'S ABSOLUTELY.

00:55:03.033 --> 00:55:04.968
FUNDAMENTAL.

00:55:05.035 --> 00:55:07.303
WE HAVE GOT TO HAVE THE PERFECT

00:55:07.370 --> 00:55:09.039
STORY AT MACADAM THE THAT

00:55:09.105 --> 00:55:09.673
REPRESENTS AND IS REFLECTIVE OF

00:55:09.739 --> 00:55:10.974
THE PEOPLE.

00:55:11.041 --> 00:55:13.009
THE GETTING THERE.

00:55:13.076 --> 00:55:16.913
IS THE HARD BIT.

00:55:16.980 --> 00:55:20.984
WE HAVE SAID WHAT WE WANT

00:55:21.051 --> 00:55:23.053
WE HAVE SAID WHAT OUR IDEALS ARE

00:55:23.119 --> 00:55:25.155
WE HAVE ENCODED. IN OUR

00:55:25.221 --> 00:55:25.755
PRACTICES THE IMPORTANCE OF

00:55:25.822 --> 00:55:26.356
DIVERSITY IN CONTRIBUTIONS TO

00:55:26.423 --> 00:55:29.025
DIVERSITY.

00:55:29.092 --> 00:55:30.894
WE'VE GOT THAT IN THE APPLICANT

00:55:30.960 --> 00:55:32.929
HAVING IT RISKY STATE.

00:55:32.996 --> 00:55:34.931
WE'VE GOT ABOUT IN OUR.

00:55:34.998 --> 00:55:37.033
APPRAISAL OF THE APPLICANT.

00:55:37.100 --> 00:55:39.369
I THINK WHAT PROFESSOR CLARK

00:55:39.436 --> 00:55:41.037
SAID IS.

00:55:41.104 --> 00:55:43.273
WE GOT TO RECOGNIZE THAT WE HAVE

00:55:43.339 --> 00:55:43.873
A PROBLEM AND THAT WE ARE THE

00:55:43.940 --> 00:55:46.943
PROBLEM.

00:55:47.010 --> 00:55:47.544
I BELIEVE WE DO BECAUSE WE'VE

00:55:47.610 --> 00:55:48.945
BEEN MAKING THOSE CHANGES.

00:55:49.012 --> 00:55:51.047
TO OURSELVES.

00:55:51.114 --> 00:55:53.049
SO IT'S A CHICKEN AND EGG.

00:55:53.116 --> 00:55:55.485
WE GO TO BREAK THE CYCLE WE'VE

00:55:55.552 --> 00:55:58.955
GOT TO HAVE A BETTER PIPELINE.

00:55:59.022 --> 00:56:01.057
AND I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT.

00:56:01.124 --> 00:56:03.259
THE FACULTY SENATE MAY GET TO

00:56:03.326 --> 00:56:04.961
MAKE A RECOMMENDATION.

00:56:05.028 --> 00:56:06.963
IT'S THE ADMINISTRATION.

00:56:07.030 --> 00:56:08.965
WHO MAKE THE HIGHER?

00:56:09.032 --> 00:56:10.967
WE MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS.

00:56:11.034 --> 00:56:11.534
AND ADMINISTRATOR MAKES THE

00:56:11.601 --> 00:56:12.969
HIGHER.

00:56:13.036 --> 00:56:16.940
SO THE LEADERSHIP AT ALL LEVELS

00:56:17.006 --> 00:56:17.440
WHETHER IT SENATORS OR

00:56:17.507 --> 00:56:18.975
ADMINISTRATIVE.

00:56:19.042 --> 00:56:19.576
DEAN OR CHANCELLOR HAS GOT TO

00:56:19.642 --> 00:56:20.977
LIVE THAT.

00:56:21.044 --> 00:56:22.979
TO.

00:56:23.046 --> 00:56:24.981
SO I GUESS IN A WAY.

00:56:25.048 --> 00:56:25.648
I'M NOT PASSING THE BUCK BUT I'M

00:56:25.715 --> 00:56:28.985
SHARING IT.

00:56:29.052 --> 00:56:30.987
A WITH THE ADMINISTRATION.

00:56:31.054 --> 00:56:31.654
I WOULD ALSO SAY WE GOT ANOTHER

00:56:31.721 --> 00:56:32.889
EXAMPLE.

00:56:32.956 --> 00:56:35.024
AT UC.

00:56:35.091 --> 00:56:37.026
OUR STUDENT BODY AS LONG.

00:56:37.093 --> 00:56:41.030
IN WAITED TOWARDS FEMALE GENDER.

00:56:41.097 --> 00:56:43.032
BUT.

00:56:43.099 --> 00:56:45.068
BUT THE NEXT STEP GRAD SCHOOL WE

00:56:45.135 --> 00:56:45.702
LOSE SOME OF THAT AT THE NEXT

00:56:45.769 --> 00:56:47.403
STEP POSTDOC WE LOSE SOME OF

00:56:47.470 --> 00:56:49.038
THAT.

00:56:49.105 --> 00:56:49.672
AT THE NEXT STEP FACULTY WE DO

00:56:49.739 --> 00:56:51.040
SOME OF THAT.

00:56:51.107 --> 00:56:54.944
NOW WE HAVE.

00:56:55.011 --> 00:56:55.578
BABY FOR PRESIDENT LAST YEAR WE

00:56:55.645 --> 00:56:56.946
HAD.

00:56:57.013 --> 00:56:58.948
A LADY AS PROVOST.

00:56:59.015 --> 00:57:00.950
WE HAVE.

00:57:01.017 --> 00:57:03.052
TWO LADIES AS COUNSELORS.

00:57:03.119 --> 00:57:04.954
WE'RE GETTING THROUGH THAT.

00:57:05.021 --> 00:57:07.056
BUT WE'VE GOT TO.

00:57:07.123 --> 00:57:09.125
RIGHT THIS THING AND IT'S A

00:57:09.192 --> 00:57:10.960
CHICKEN AND EGG THING.

00:57:11.027 --> 00:57:13.229
IT'S VERY VERY HARD TO DO BUT I

00:57:13.296 --> 00:57:15.298
REALLY SEE THE PIPELINE. WE'VE

00:57:15.365 --> 00:57:17.433
GOT TO PUT OUR RESOURCES INTO

00:57:17.500 --> 00:57:18.968
THAT PIPELINE.

00:57:19.035 --> 00:57:21.371
I HOPE I'M HELPING. YOU CONTEXT

00:57:21.437 --> 00:57:22.972
AND ADDRESS YOUR QUESTION.

00:57:23.039 --> 00:57:24.974
YOU ARE.

00:57:25.041 --> 00:57:27.110
GOOD COULD I FOLLOW UP ON AYE

00:57:27.177 --> 00:57:29.245
AYE REFERENCE THE YEAR NINETEEN

00:57:29.312 --> 00:57:29.579
SIXTY EIGHT.

00:57:29.646 --> 00:57:31.014
SINCE THEN.

00:57:31.080 --> 00:57:33.016
NO DOCTOR WEBER.

00:57:33.082 --> 00:57:35.218
I HAVE GOT THROUGH.

00:57:35.285 --> 00:57:39.022
GOT HER DOCTORATE AT UCLA.

00:57:39.088 --> 00:57:40.924
THERE ARE MANY MORE LIKER.

00:57:40.990 --> 00:57:43.226
WHO GRADUATED AND GOT THEIR

00:57:43.293 --> 00:57:45.295
DOCTORATES FROM OUR INSTITUTIONS

00:57:45.361 --> 00:57:45.762
FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF

00:57:45.829 --> 00:57:47.030
CALIFORNIA?

00:57:47.096 --> 00:57:49.432
SO IS IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE

00:57:49.499 --> 00:57:50.934
NUMBER OF.

00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:51.201
QUALIFY.

00:57:51.267 --> 00:57:52.936
.

00:57:53.002 --> 00:57:57.106
FOLKS WITH WITH P. H. D.'S HAVE

00:57:57.173 --> 00:57:59.042
VASTLY INCREASED.

00:57:59.108 --> 00:58:01.044
OVER THE LAST FIFTY YEARS.

00:58:01.110 --> 00:58:03.413
BUT STILL THE NUMBER OF FACULTY

00:58:03.479 --> 00:58:07.116
REMAIN. THE SAME SO I I I I I

00:58:07.183 --> 00:58:08.918
UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW WANTING TO

00:58:08.985 --> 00:58:09.085
TO.

00:58:09.152 --> 00:58:12.922
INCREASE THE PIPELINE BUT I WAS

00:58:12.989 --> 00:58:15.191
A STUDENT HERE. AND I I GOT MY

00:58:15.258 --> 00:58:17.126

00:58:38.948 --> 00:58:41.017
SO I I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT JUST

00:58:41.084 --> 00:58:41.284
BE KNOW.

00:58:41.351 --> 00:58:44.988
FIFTY YEARS AGO WE WERE SAYING

00:58:45.054 --> 00:58:45.622
THE SAME THING. WE WERE ST FIFTY

00:58:45.688 --> 00:58:47.290
YEARS AGO THAT THERE WERE NOT

00:58:47.357 --> 00:58:49.025
ENOUGH.

00:58:49.092 --> 00:58:50.894
BUT BUT THERE HAVE BEEN THE

00:58:50.960 --> 00:58:53.029
NUMBER HAS HAD TO HAVE INCREASED.

00:58:53.096 --> 00:58:53.663
AND IN THE IN THE POOL AS THEY

00:58:53.730 --> 00:58:56.933
SAY.

00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:59.002
I'M CAN I SPEAK BRIEFLY TO THAT

00:58:59.068 --> 00:58:59.602
THE PIPELINE QUESTION BECAUSE

00:58:59.669 --> 00:59:00.203
IT'S SOMETHING WE'VE TALKED A

00:59:00.270 --> 00:59:01.304
LOT ABOUT WORKING WITH COMMUNITY

00:59:01.371 --> 00:59:03.306
COLLEGES SO I KNOW THAT THAT THE

00:59:03.373 --> 00:59:04.007
UC IS OF COURSE A VERY DIFFERENT

00:59:04.073 --> 00:59:05.041
CONTACTS.

00:59:05.108 --> 00:59:07.277
BUT I CAN TELL YOU WE HEAR THE

00:59:07.343 --> 00:59:09.279
SAME EXACT ARGUMENTS EVERY TIME

00:59:09.345 --> 00:59:11.214
WE SPEAK TO FACULTY FROM

00:59:11.281 --> 00:59:13.082
COMMUNITY COLLEGES ABOUT WHY

00:59:13.149 --> 00:59:14.951
CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES.

00:59:15.018 --> 00:59:17.086
I'M HAVE A SUCH A VAST MAJORITY

00:59:17.153 --> 00:59:19.022
OF WHITE FACULTY THAT HAS NOT

00:59:19.088 --> 00:59:21.090
BUDGED IN ANY SUBSTANTIAL WAY IN

00:59:21.157 --> 00:59:21.724
THESE YEARS THAT YOU'RE TALKING

00:59:21.791 --> 00:59:23.359
ABOUT. ON AND WHAT SO WHAT WE

00:59:23.426 --> 00:59:25.495
DID OUR CENTER IS WE WENT AND WE

00:59:25.561 --> 00:59:27.363
FOUND IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS

00:59:27.430 --> 00:59:30.934
EVERY SINGLE PERSON WHO MEETS

00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:31.567
THE MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS WHO

00:59:31.634 --> 00:59:33.303
IS AFRICAN AMERICAN AND NATIVE

00:59:33.369 --> 00:59:35.271
AMERICAN LATIN NEXT PACIFIC

00:59:35.338 --> 00:59:37.373
ISLANDER. AN ASIAN AMERICAN IN

00:59:37.440 --> 00:59:39.208
THE STATE FROM THE CS YOU AND

00:59:39.275 --> 00:59:41.077
THAT YOU SEE SYSTEM. SO WE

00:59:41.144 --> 00:59:43.179
ACTUALLY CREATED A POCKET FOR

00:59:43.246 --> 00:59:45.214
ALL OF OUR FACULTY TO SHOW THIS

00:59:45.281 --> 00:59:48.985
IS YOUR POOL AND IT'S ACTUALLY A

00:59:49.052 --> 00:59:51.120
MASSIVE POOL SO THEY HEARD

00:59:51.187 --> 00:59:53.189
SOMETHING ELSE THAT IS GOING ON.

00:59:53.256 --> 00:59:55.124
ARE YOU IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE

00:59:55.191 --> 00:59:57.060
SYSTEM WHERE THE REQUIREMENT TO

00:59:57.126 --> 00:59:58.928
TEACH IS A MASTER'S DEGREE.

00:59:58.995 --> 01:00:01.264
ARE YOU GOING FOR THAT WHITE

01:00:01.331 --> 01:00:03.132
CANDIDATE WITH THE PHD AND IF

01:00:03.199 --> 01:00:05.068
YOU ARE DEAD Y..

01:00:05.134 --> 01:00:07.437
WHAT ARE THE WAYS YOU NEED TO

01:00:07.503 --> 01:00:11.007
REPHRASE? YOUR NOTION OF MERIT

01:00:11.074 --> 01:00:13.176
SO THAT YOU CAN BE SURE THAT YOU

01:00:13.242 --> 01:00:14.978
ARE ACTUALLY FULFILLING THE

01:00:15.044 --> 01:00:19.048
NEEDS OF YOUR STUDENTS.

01:00:19.115 --> 01:00:19.649
I'D LIKE TO JUST CHIME IN I

01:00:19.716 --> 01:00:21.250
FIGURED YOUR SPOT ON AND AND I

01:00:21.317 --> 01:00:23.119
THINK ONE OF THE THINGS AT LEAST

01:00:23.186 --> 01:00:23.753
FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES IS THAT

01:00:23.820 --> 01:00:25.455
WE DON'T HAVE. WHEN YOU LOST ME

01:00:25.521 --> 01:00:27.190
ON THE ARTICLES FOR TENURE AND

01:00:27.256 --> 01:00:28.925
ALL THAT RIGHT BECAUSE IT'S VERY

01:00:28.992 --> 01:00:29.559
DIFFERENT FOR US. ARM AND IS

01:00:29.625 --> 01:00:31.160
ABOUT THE TEACHER RIGHT AND WE

01:00:31.227 --> 01:00:32.962
ARE COLLEGES OF OF TEACHING.

01:00:33.029 --> 01:00:35.298
SO I THINK REALLY THE

01:00:35.365 --> 01:00:35.865
CONVERSATION IT HAS TO BE A

01:00:35.932 --> 01:00:36.966
MORAL IMPERATIVE.

01:00:37.033 --> 01:00:39.402
IT HAS TO BE THE IDEA THAT THIS

01:00:39.469 --> 01:00:41.237
IS A MORAL IMPERATIVE AND SO WE

01:00:41.304 --> 01:00:43.006
HAVE GOT TO START EXAMINING OUR

01:00:43.072 --> 01:00:45.108
PROCESS SEIZE WE'VE GOT TO

01:00:45.174 --> 01:00:45.742
REDUCE THOSE BARRIERS WE HAVE

01:00:45.808 --> 01:00:47.310
GOT TO THAT POOL IS OUT THERE.

01:00:47.377 --> 01:00:49.212
AND WE HAVE GOT TO FIGURE OUT

01:00:49.278 --> 01:00:52.982
WHY WERE NOT RECRUITING APPLE

01:00:53.049 --> 01:00:53.683
HOWEVER NOT RECRUITING THAT PULL

01:00:53.750 --> 01:00:56.986
TO GET IN SO THAT WE WIDEN. THAT

01:00:57.053 --> 01:00:57.620
PULL THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT AND

01:00:57.687 --> 01:01:00.990
ENSURING THAT WE ARE HIRING

01:01:01.057 --> 01:01:02.959
THOSE THAT ARE READY TO MEET OUR

01:01:03.026 --> 01:01:03.526
STUDENTS AND AND AND THAT'S

01:01:03.593 --> 01:01:05.028
REALLY.

01:01:05.094 --> 01:01:07.196
WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT I DO I DO

01:01:07.263 --> 01:01:09.098
THINK ALSO THERE HAS TO BE THIS

01:01:09.165 --> 01:01:10.900
CHANGE IN THE WAY THAT WE TALK

01:01:10.967 --> 01:01:11.534
ABOUT TEACHING AND LEARNING AND

01:01:11.601 --> 01:01:11.801
PEDAGOGY?

01:01:11.868 --> 01:01:13.302
AND WE HAVE TO GO BACK TO

01:01:13.369 --> 01:01:15.038
CRITICAL PEDAGOGY AND AND AND

01:01:15.104 --> 01:01:16.939
WE'VE GOT TO FIGURE THAT OUT.

01:01:17.006 --> 01:01:18.908
AMONGST OURSELVES AND I THINK

01:01:18.975 --> 01:01:19.575
THAT'S WHY RELEASED WHEN WE LOOK

01:01:19.642 --> 01:01:21.344
AT WHAT'S HAPPENING.

01:01:21.411 --> 01:01:23.279
FOR FACULTY IN THE

01:01:23.346 --> 01:01:25.048
COMMUNICATIVE JUST.

01:01:25.114 --> 01:01:25.681
WE NEED TO HAVE THE COURAGE TO

01:01:25.748 --> 01:01:27.216
HAVE THE CONVERSATIONS TO

01:01:27.283 --> 01:01:29.052
CONFRONT.

01:01:29.118 --> 01:01:31.254
OUR COLLEAGUES AND OUR PRACTICES

01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:33.356
AND WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO

01:01:33.423 --> 01:01:37.060
GET RID OF.

01:01:37.126 --> 01:01:37.660
THE STUFF THAT IS NOT SERVING

01:01:37.727 --> 01:01:39.095
OUR STUDENTS AND REALLY FOCUS ON

01:01:39.162 --> 01:01:41.230
WHERE WE NEED TO SERVE THEM. AND

01:01:41.297 --> 01:01:41.497
SO THAT.

01:01:41.564 --> 01:01:43.032
THAT TAKES

01:01:43.099 --> 01:01:46.936
TIME AND IT TAKES ON SPACE

01:01:47.003 --> 01:01:49.138
TO DO AND SO I THINK REALLY IF

01:01:49.205 --> 01:01:51.007
WE CAN FIGURE OUT.

01:01:51.074 --> 01:01:53.076
AND AND AND JUST CREATE THAT

01:01:53.142 --> 01:01:53.709
SPACE AND I THINK WE'RE REALLY

01:01:53.776 --> 01:01:55.378
STARTING TO I THINK THE WORK.

01:01:55.445 --> 01:01:57.413
THAT AND Q. IS DOING I THINK THE

01:01:57.480 --> 01:01:59.348
WORK THAT OF THE CHANCELLOR'S

01:01:59.415 --> 01:02:01.150
OFFICE IN THE ACADEMIC SENATE SO

01:02:01.217 --> 01:02:01.818
I THINK THE WORK THEY WERE DOING

01:02:01.884 --> 01:02:03.352
AROUND THE GUIDED PATHWAYS AWARD

01:02:03.419 --> 01:02:05.154
PROGRAM. IS ACTUALLY PART OF

01:02:05.221 --> 01:02:06.889
THAT IS BRINGING PEOPLE TOGETHER

01:02:06.956 --> 01:02:09.025
TO REALLY LOOK AT WHAT ARE WE

01:02:09.092 --> 01:02:09.492
CREATING AS BARRIERS.

01:02:09.559 --> 01:02:13.062
BUT. IT IT IT'S IT HAS TO BE AN

01:02:13.129 --> 01:02:13.729
INSTITUTION WIDE AND BECAUSE OUR

01:02:13.796 --> 01:02:15.331
COLLEGES OUR LOCAL COMMUNITY

01:02:15.398 --> 01:02:19.068
BASED INSTITUTIONS THAT WORK IS

01:02:19.135 --> 01:02:21.037
FOR THEM TO REALLY DIGGIN INTO.

01:02:21.104 --> 01:02:23.005
BUT I TAKE MISTER MEDINA'S POINT

01:02:23.072 --> 01:02:25.074
IT'S BEEN FIFTY YEARS WE'VE HAD

01:02:25.141 --> 01:02:27.110
THAT MORAL IMPERATIVE EVEN BACK

01:02:27.176 --> 01:02:29.011
THEN IS WHAT'S NOT THE MERE

01:02:29.078 --> 01:02:30.947
MORAL IMPERATIVE THAT'S CHANGED.

01:02:31.013 --> 01:02:31.514
I WOULD SAY WHAT'S THE BIG

01:02:31.581 --> 01:02:33.116
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FIFTY YEARS

01:02:33.182 --> 01:02:35.084
AGO AND NOW IS WHETHER WE CAN BE

01:02:35.151 --> 01:02:36.953
MORE INTENTIONAL ABOUT IT.

01:02:37.019 --> 01:02:39.122
AND INTENTIONALITY A LOT OF THE

01:02:39.188 --> 01:02:39.722
RIVER THE THINGS THAT DRIVE

01:02:39.789 --> 01:02:41.357
FACULTY IS DATA. WE HAVE DATA

01:02:41.424 --> 01:02:43.326
DASHBOARDS NOW THAT WE NEVER HAD

01:02:43.392 --> 01:02:45.528
BACK FIFTY YEARS AGO WE HAVE THE

01:02:45.595 --> 01:02:48.965
DATA LIKE THE THE THE.

01:02:49.031 --> 01:02:51.033
THAT SLIDES THAT HAVE BEEN

01:02:51.100 --> 01:02:53.069
SHOWN TODAY THAT SHOW THE FOR

01:02:53.136 --> 01:02:55.104
THE THE SITUATION AND WE CAN

01:02:55.171 --> 01:02:55.638
POINT TO THAT RATHER THAN

01:02:55.705 --> 01:02:57.006
ANECDOTES.

01:02:57.073 --> 01:02:59.175
WE KNOW FOR INSTANCE THAT THAT

01:02:59.242 --> 01:03:00.977
STUDENTS TELL US I SUCCEED

01:03:01.043 --> 01:03:02.979
BETTER WHEN I SEE SOMEONE LIKE

01:03:03.045 --> 01:03:03.646
ME UP IN FRONT OF THE CLASSROOM

01:03:03.713 --> 01:03:05.381
AND THAT'S IT ANECDOTES. WHEN WE

01:03:05.448 --> 01:03:07.150
CAN WHEN WE CAN TAKE DATA AND

01:03:07.216 --> 01:03:09.051
PUT IT TO THOSE ANECDOTES IT

01:03:09.118 --> 01:03:11.087
GIVES US MORE AMMUNITION TO BE

01:03:11.154 --> 01:03:13.055
INTENTIONAL. AND ONCE WE CAN GET

01:03:13.122 --> 01:03:13.623
INTENTIONAL ABOUT IT WE CAN

01:03:13.689 --> 01:03:15.024
REWARD.

01:03:15.091 --> 01:03:17.026
SO WE CAN REMOVE THEM FROM A

01:03:17.093 --> 01:03:18.895
REWARDING FOR INSTANCE

01:03:18.961 --> 01:03:21.164
PUBLICATIONS TO RIP TO REWARDING

01:03:21.230 --> 01:03:23.232
HOW MANY STUDENTS OF COLOR HAVE

01:03:23.299 --> 01:03:23.699
YOU HELPED THIS YEAR.

01:03:23.766 --> 01:03:25.401
THAT KIND OF THING WHERE WE CAN

01:03:25.468 --> 01:03:27.236
ACTUALLY NOW BEGIN TO TRACK IT

01:03:27.303 --> 01:03:29.305
AND AND HOPEFULLY BEGIN TO

01:03:29.372 --> 01:03:31.374
REWARDED SO THE MORAL IMPERATIVE

01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:33.009
IS STILL THERE AND I THINK IT'S

01:03:33.075 --> 01:03:35.344
IT'S STRONG. IT JUST NEEDS TO

01:03:35.411 --> 01:03:37.113
HAVE SOME BACKING TO IT NOW WITH

01:03:37.180 --> 01:03:37.680
THE REWARD STRUCTURE IN MORE

01:03:37.747 --> 01:03:38.948
INTENTIONALITY.

01:03:39.015 --> 01:03:41.350
I'D I'D I THINK YOU YOU YOU.

01:03:41.417 --> 01:03:42.952
.

01:03:43.019 --> 01:03:44.921
I THINK CLEARLY INTENTIONALITY

01:03:44.987 --> 01:03:45.388
IS CRITICAL BECAUSE.

01:03:45.454 --> 01:03:47.456
IF YOU DON'T MAKE THAT YOUR

01:03:47.523 --> 01:03:49.525
GOAL. A TO DO YOU WON'T NEED IT

01:03:49.592 --> 01:03:51.227
BECOMES NO MORE THAN OPEN

01:03:51.294 --> 01:03:52.962
STATEMENTS.

01:03:53.029 --> 01:03:54.964
AND I THINK ALSO WE HAVE TO ASK

01:03:55.031 --> 01:03:55.765
OURSELVES IN AND I'M SURE YOU DO.

01:03:57.033 --> 01:03:59.135
WHY IS IT THAT THOSE WHO COME

01:03:59.202 --> 01:04:01.003
DON'T STAY SOMETIMES?

01:04:01.070 --> 01:04:03.105
IT HAS A LOT TO DO WITH THE THE

01:04:03.172 --> 01:04:03.773
FACT THAT THE ENVIRONMENT IS NOT

01:04:03.839 --> 01:04:05.007
ALWAYS WELCOMING.

01:04:05.074 --> 01:04:08.978
A YOU CAN'T EXPECT TO INFUSE

01:04:09.045 --> 01:04:11.080
WOMEN AND PEOPLE OF COLOR INTO

01:04:11.147 --> 01:04:13.182
AN INSTITUTION AND EXPECT THEM

01:04:13.249 --> 01:04:14.951
TO ACT LIKE MEN WERE WHITE. OF

01:04:15.017 --> 01:04:17.019
THEY BRING A DIFFERENT KIND OF

01:04:17.086 --> 01:04:19.021
FLAVOR AFFECTED THEM. ALL A

01:04:19.088 --> 01:04:19.622
DIFFERENT ATMOSPHERE TO THE

01:04:19.689 --> 01:04:21.324
CAMPUS AND THAT'S PROBABLY WHAT

01:04:21.390 --> 01:04:23.025
STUDENTS ARE TRACKED A TO DO.

01:04:23.092 --> 01:04:25.161
BOB AND SO IF YOU IF YOU IF YOU

01:04:25.228 --> 01:04:27.296
ARE COSTLY LOOKING FOR THOSE

01:04:27.363 --> 01:04:29.332
FACULTY OR YOUR COLLEAGUE WHO

01:04:29.398 --> 01:04:31.234
LOOKS LIKE YOU WHO MAY NOT LOOK

01:04:31.300 --> 01:04:33.035
LIKE YOU WOULD ACT LIKE YOU.

01:04:33.102 --> 01:04:34.937
THEN YOU END UP.

01:04:35.004 --> 01:04:37.006
BASICALLY BRINGING PEOPLE INTO

01:04:37.073 --> 01:04:38.908
A INSTITUTION WHICH WE OFTEN DO

01:04:38.975 --> 01:04:39.609
THAT HAVE LITTLE RELATIONSHIP TO

01:04:39.675 --> 01:04:42.912
THE STUDENTS AT ALL. OKAY AND SO

01:04:42.979 --> 01:04:43.579
I I DIDN'T ADMIT IT'S NOT ONLY

01:04:43.646 --> 01:04:45.281
YOU IT'S ALSO K. TWELVE AND

01:04:45.348 --> 01:04:47.083
EVERYBODY ELSE AND SO I THINK WE

01:04:47.149 --> 01:04:48.951
HAVE TO MAKE REALIZE OF ONCE YOU.

01:04:49.018 --> 01:04:50.953
DECIDE THAT THE INSTITUTION.

01:04:51.020 --> 01:04:53.322
NEEDS TO BE INFUSED WITH THAT

01:04:53.389 --> 01:04:55.224
WITH A DIVERSE FACULTY ARE

01:04:55.291 --> 01:04:57.093
DIVERSE CURRICULUM WE HAVE TO

01:04:57.159 --> 01:04:58.928
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THAT IVORY

01:04:58.995 --> 01:04:59.562
TOWER WOULD NO LONGER BE IVORY

01:04:59.629 --> 01:05:01.063
COLORED ANYMORE.

01:05:01.130 --> 01:05:03.132
IT WILL BE YOU KNOW MAYBE

01:05:03.199 --> 01:05:05.001
JAMAICAN COLORED OR WHATEVER BUT

01:05:05.067 --> 01:05:07.303
IT WILL NOT BE THE SAME AND THAT

01:05:07.370 --> 01:05:09.171
AND AND I FOUND AS A FACULTY

01:05:09.238 --> 01:05:11.140
MEMBER. ON THE SENATE AND CHAIR

01:05:11.207 --> 01:05:12.975
OF THE DEPARTMENT ABOUT THIRTY

01:05:13.042 --> 01:05:14.977
YEARS AND EVERYTHING ELSE THAT

01:05:15.044 --> 01:05:15.611
THAT WAS PROBABLY THE GREATEST

01:05:15.678 --> 01:05:17.346
CHALLENGE THAT PEOPLE WANTED

01:05:17.413 --> 01:05:19.348
FOLKS THERE BUT THEY WANTED THEM

01:05:19.415 --> 01:05:20.883
TO ACT LIKE THEM. AND I'D REMIND

01:05:20.950 --> 01:05:21.584
THAT THIS IS AN AFRICAN AMERICAN

01:05:21.651 --> 01:05:23.319
MALE HE DOESN'T ACT LIKE THE

01:05:23.386 --> 01:05:25.321
OTHER ONES AND HE'S IT AND THE

01:05:25.388 --> 01:05:26.989
STUDENTS ARE TRACKED IT TO HIM

01:05:27.056 --> 01:05:27.657
BECAUSE HE HAS A SWAGGER TO HIM

01:05:27.723 --> 01:05:29.158
THAT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE

01:05:29.225 --> 01:05:31.060
EXCITING. UP HIS CURRICULUM YOU

01:05:31.127 --> 01:05:33.062
KNOW HIS SUBJECT MATTERS IS

01:05:33.129 --> 01:05:33.663
CLEAR HE TEACHES A CLASS HE

01:05:33.729 --> 01:05:35.498
KNOWS MATERIAL WHAT HE MAY BE A

01:05:35.564 --> 01:05:37.266
LITTLE LOUDER IN THE HALLWAY

01:05:37.333 --> 01:05:37.900
THAN SOMEBODY ELSE OR WHATEVER

01:05:37.967 --> 01:05:39.468
IT MAY BE. AND SO WE HAVE TO

01:05:39.535 --> 01:05:41.370
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IF YOU'RE IN

01:05:41.437 --> 01:05:43.039
THE PROCESS OF CHANGE IT IS

01:05:43.105 --> 01:05:43.673
GOING TO CHANGE IT IS NOT GOING

01:05:43.739 --> 01:05:45.508
TO LOOK LIKE WHAT YOU WANT TO

01:05:45.574 --> 01:05:47.209
LOOK LIKE. AND I THINK THAT MORE

01:05:47.276 --> 01:05:47.777
THAN ANYTHING ELSE IS THE

01:05:47.843 --> 01:05:49.345
HARDEST PART A I'D YOU KNOW AND

01:05:49.412 --> 01:05:51.314
AND AND AND. AND AND IT'S

01:05:51.380 --> 01:05:53.349
INTERESTING BECAUSE WHEN I WAS

01:05:53.416 --> 01:05:55.017
ON THE FACULTY. WE WOULD HAVE

01:05:55.084 --> 01:05:56.919
FOLKS WHO WOULD DIE GO OUT WITH

01:05:56.986 --> 01:05:58.954
EVERY INTENTION TO HIRE A PERSON.

01:05:59.021 --> 01:05:59.622
AND BRING THEM TO CAMPUS AFRICAN

01:05:59.689 --> 01:06:00.956
AMERICAN.

01:06:01.023 --> 01:06:01.457
BRING THEM TO CAMP WAS

01:06:01.524 --> 01:06:03.225
INTRODUCED INTO THE FACULTY

01:06:03.292 --> 01:06:03.659
INTRODUCED INTO THE

01:06:03.726 --> 01:06:04.293
ADMINISTRATION AND THEN I WOULD

01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:04.960
LEAD.

01:06:05.027 --> 01:06:07.229
THEY WOULD GET HOME THEY WOULD

01:06:07.296 --> 01:06:09.131
CALL ME BECAUSE SOMEBODY SAID

01:06:09.198 --> 01:06:11.033
DID YOU MEET GOT THE WEBER GOOD

01:06:11.100 --> 01:06:11.734
CHEER FOSCA SAID NO. AND SO THEY

01:06:11.801 --> 01:06:13.436
WOULD CALL ME AND SAY I DIDN'T

01:06:13.502 --> 01:06:15.438
MEET ANY BLACK PEOPLE WHAT I WAS

01:06:15.504 --> 01:06:15.738
ON CAMPUS.

01:06:15.805 --> 01:06:17.273
WHERE IS THAT BLACK LIFE THAT

01:06:17.340 --> 01:06:19.041
I'M GOING TO BE A PART OF THE

01:06:19.108 --> 01:06:19.709

I MENTION THAT TO COLLEAGUES ARE

01:06:23.946 --> 01:06:24.980
SO WHAT WE DON'T THINK THAT WAS

01:06:25.047 --> 01:06:25.481
VERY IMPORTANT. WHAT IS

01:06:25.548 --> 01:06:27.316
IMPORTANT YOU HIRING AFRICAN

01:06:27.383 --> 01:06:29.385
AMERICANS KNOW THAT THERE'S AN

01:06:29.452 --> 01:06:30.986
AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY IN

01:06:31.053 --> 01:06:33.122
SAN DIEGO THERE'S ONE ON CAMPUS

01:06:33.189 --> 01:06:35.091
FACULTY AND STAFF? AND THAT THEY

01:06:35.157 --> 01:06:35.725
MAY WANT TO BE A PART OF IT

01:06:35.791 --> 01:06:37.360
BECAUSE AND THEN THEY REALIZE I

01:06:37.426 --> 01:06:39.095
COULD NOT ONLY TEACH HERE BUT I

01:06:39.161 --> 01:06:41.097

01:22:11.092 --> 01:22:13.461
CFA RECOMMENDS FUNDING THE CSU

ONLY THIS FUNDING LEVEL WOULD

01:22:25.073 --> 01:22:26.908
ADDITIONAL EIGHTEEN THOUSAND FTE

01:22:26.975 --> 01:22:29.044

01:22:29.110 --> 01:22:29.678
THAT IS BEING TURNED AWAY ONLY

01:22:29.744 --> 01:22:32.947

OUR WEBSITE CAL FACT DOT ORG

01:22:37.218 --> 01:22:39.254
EQUITY INTERRUPTED SHOWED THAT

01:22:39.321 --> 01:22:41.423
THE CSU SYSTEM EDUCATES MORE

01:22:41.489 --> 01:22:43.458
DIVERSE STUDENT BODY TODAY THAN

01:22:43.525 --> 01:22:44.959
IT DID THIRTY YEARS AGO.

01:22:45.026 --> 01:22:47.429
BUT ASTHMA NUMBER OF STUDENTS OF

01:22:47.495 --> 01:22:49.264
COLOR INCREASED THE FUNDING WENT

01:22:49.331 --> 01:22:53.001
DOWN AS WE SEE IT WHEN THE

01:22:53.068 --> 01:22:53.601
STUDENT BODY GOT DARKER THE

01:22:53.668 --> 01:22:56.971
FUNDING GOT LIGHTER.

01:22:57.038 --> 01:22:58.973
ONLY IT'S NOT FUNNY.

01:22:59.040 --> 01:23:01.076
NINETY FOUR PERCENT OF THE

01:23:01.142 --> 01:23:03.111
STUDENT BODY IN THE CSU IS FROM

01:23:03.178 --> 01:23:05.280
CALIFORNIA THREE QUARTERS OF

01:23:05.347 --> 01:23:05.880
THEM IDENTIFY AS STUDENTS OF

01:23:05.947 --> 01:23:06.981
COLOR.

01:23:07.048 --> 01:23:09.451
WE KNOW HIGHER EDUCATION IS SUCH

01:23:09.517 --> 01:23:11.186
AN IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITY

01:23:11.252 --> 01:23:13.355
STRUCTURE AND THAT IT'S HELPFUL

01:23:13.421 --> 01:23:15.290
FOR THE ECONOMY AS WELL SO WE

01:23:15.357 --> 01:23:18.893
URGE THAT THE CSU BE FUNDED AT A

01:23:18.960 --> 01:23:19.427

ADMITTED TO A PUBLIC UNIVERSITY.

01:23:27.102 --> 01:23:29.003
OUR REQUEST FOR THAT FOUR

01:23:29.070 --> 01:23:29.671
HUNDRED TWENTY TWO MILLION WOULD

01:23:29.738 --> 01:23:31.506
ONLY RETURN US TO HALF THE LEVEL

01:23:31.573 --> 01:23:33.375
OF SUPPORT ENJOYED BY STUDENTS

01:23:33.441 --> 01:23:35.310
IN CALIFORNIA OF THE NINETEEN

01:23:35.377 --> 01:23:37.212
EIGHTIES WHEN THE AVERAGE

01:23:37.278 --> 01:23:39.047
STUDENT WAS A WHITE MALE.

01:23:39.114 --> 01:23:41.082
IN TERMS OF EQUITY A RELATED

01:23:41.149 --> 01:23:45.019
ASPECT IS THE STUDENTS NEED

01:23:45.086 --> 01:23:47.122
FACULTY WHO CAN PROVIDE THEM

01:23:47.188 --> 01:23:49.124
WITH EQUITY IN EDUCATION WHICH

01:23:49.190 --> 01:23:51.393
IS NOT POSSIBLE BECAUSE OF

01:23:51.459 --> 01:23:53.094
PROBLEMS OF IMPLICIT BIAS IN

01:23:53.161 --> 01:23:55.230
FACULTY HIRING AND EVALUATION.

01:23:55.296 --> 01:23:57.265

01:23:57.332 --> 01:23:58.967
DIVERSIFICATION OF THE FACULTY.

01:23:59.033 --> 01:24:03.037
A SHORT HURT TERM I'M FOR THAT

01:24:03.104 --> 01:24:04.939
WOULD BE RACISM

01:24:05.006 --> 01:24:07.075
RACISM IS A PROBLEM HAVEN'T

01:24:07.142 --> 01:24:09.144
HEARD THAT WORD TODAY SO I FEEL

01:24:09.210 --> 01:24:09.711
LIKE PUTTING THAT OUT ON THE

01:24:09.778 --> 01:24:10.979

01:24:29.097 --> 01:24:30.999
MUST TRANSFORM TRADITIONAL

01:24:31.065 --> 01:24:33.067

01:24:53.021 --> 01:24:55.089

CAN ONLY BE ASSURED BY ENDING

01:25:11.005 --> 01:25:11.473
THE RECENT TRENDS TOWARD

01:25:11.539 --> 01:25:13.174
RELIANCE ON QUOTE UNQUOTE

MENTORING COLLABORATIVE WORK

01:25:43.404 --> 01:25:45.206
WITH STUDENTS COMMITTEE SERVICE

01:25:45.273 --> 01:25:48.910
ACADEMIC PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT AND

REVIEW FACULTY PEER EVALUATION

01:25:51.279 --> 01:25:51.546
AND SO FORTH.

01:25:51.613 --> 01:25:53.348
FIFTY YEARS OF RESEARCH SHOWS

01:25:53.414 --> 01:25:55.383
THAT STUDENT AT VANCE MEN IN AND

01:25:55.450 --> 01:25:57.118
BEYOND COLLEGE DEPENDS ON

01:25:57.185 --> 01:25:59.220
RELATIONSHIPS THEY BUILD WITH

01:25:59.287 --> 01:26:01.289
FACULTY THROUGH THE KINDS OF

01:26:01.356 --> 01:26:03.124
SERVICE THAT TENURE TRACK

01:26:03.191 --> 01:26:03.525
FACULTY PROVIDE.

01:26:03.591 --> 01:26:05.493
FOR GROWING NUMBERS OF STUDENTS

01:26:05.560 --> 01:26:07.161
WHO ARE OF COLOR WHO ARE

01:26:07.228 --> 01:26:09.264
IMMIGRANT WHO ARE FIRST

01:26:09.330 --> 01:26:11.032
GENERATION WHO ARE VETERAN THESE

01:26:11.099 --> 01:26:13.001
MENTORING RELATIONSHIPS ARE

01:26:13.067 --> 01:26:14.969
CRITICAL TO THEIR SUCCESS.

01:26:15.036 --> 01:26:17.171
EXAMPLE I HAD A STUDENT WHO

01:26:17.238 --> 01:26:19.040
WISHES WALK INTO THE CAFETERIA

01:26:19.107 --> 01:26:21.075
WHEN I SAW HER SHE WAS ON THE

01:26:21.142 --> 01:26:22.944
VERGE OF DROPPING OUT I HAD NO

01:26:23.011 --> 01:26:25.013
IDEA. BUT WHEN WE SPOKE SHE

01:26:25.079 --> 01:26:26.948
STAYED IN SCHOOL SHE GOT

01:26:27.015 --> 01:26:29.117
STRATEGIES TO STAY AND SHE IS A

01:26:29.183 --> 01:26:31.052
NATIVE WOMAN AN INDIGENOUS WOMAN

01:26:31.119 --> 01:26:33.321
WHO IS NOW A FULL PROFESSOR. AT

01:26:33.388 --> 01:26:34.989
A COLLEGE.

01:26:35.056 --> 01:26:36.991
WE CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

01:26:37.058 --> 01:26:41.029
SO THROUGH TENURE TRACK FACULTY.

01:26:41.095 --> 01:26:42.997
WE CAN PROVIDE THESE KINDS OF

01:26:43.064 --> 01:26:43.531
SERVICES IMPORTANT TO OUR

01:26:43.598 --> 01:26:45.266
STUDENTS BUT THE GROWING

01:26:45.333 --> 01:26:47.001
RELIANCE ON THE CONTINGENT

01:26:47.068 --> 01:26:49.170
FACULTY WORKFORCE MEANS THAT WE

01:26:49.237 --> 01:26:51.039
ARE UNDER SERVING THOSE STUDENTS.

01:26:51.105 --> 01:26:53.107
AND IT ALSO MEANS A GREATER

01:26:53.174 --> 01:26:53.741
BURDEN ON THOSE WHO OUR FACULTY

01:26:53.808 --> 01:26:57.178
OF COLOR IN THE CFA WE CALL THIS

01:26:57.245 --> 01:26:59.247
CULTURAL TAXATION THAT FACULTY

01:26:59.314 --> 01:27:01.249
OF COLOR HAVE TO PAY AS THEY ARE

01:27:01.316 --> 01:27:03.351
THE ONES WHO KNOW WHAT THEIR

01:27:03.418 --> 01:27:04.953
STUDENTS NEED.

01:27:05.019 --> 01:27:07.188
AND I SEE THIS THROUGH EFFORTS

01:27:07.255 --> 01:27:09.157
OF MY COLLEAGUES SO FOR EXAMPLE

01:27:09.223 --> 01:27:11.092
STUDENTS WILL SAY PROFESSOR X.

01:27:11.159 --> 01:27:13.027
KEPT ME IN SCHOOL OR I DIDN'T

01:27:13.094 --> 01:27:13.561
FEEL I BELONGED HERE BUT

01:27:13.628 --> 01:27:15.430
PROFESSOR X. TOLD ME ABOUT HER

01:27:15.496 --> 01:27:17.365
JOURNEY TO THE PHD. AND SHE HAD

01:27:17.432 --> 01:27:19.500
THE SAME STRUGGLES IT GAVE ME

01:27:19.567 --> 01:27:21.035
CONFIDENCE

01:27:21.102 --> 01:27:22.937
SO PROFESSOR ACCESS CULTURALLY

01:27:23.004 --> 01:27:25.173
TAX BUT SHE WILL PAY THAT TAX TO

01:27:25.239 --> 01:27:25.740
HELP THOSE STUDENTS STAY IN

01:27:25.807 --> 01:27:26.975
SCHOOL.

01:27:27.041 --> 01:27:30.945
CFA THEREFORE PROPOSES A BUDGET

01:27:31.012 --> 01:27:32.947
THAT SETS ASIDE FIFTY MILLION

01:27:33.014 --> 01:27:33.514
DOLLARS OF EXISTING ONGOING

01:27:33.581 --> 01:27:35.416
FUNDS JUST TO TARGET THE HIRING

01:27:35.483 --> 01:27:36.985
OF TENURE TRACK FACULTY.

01:27:37.051 --> 01:27:39.420
THE THIRD FRAMING QUESTION WAS

01:27:39.487 --> 01:27:41.255
HOW THE MASTER PLAN OF MET THE

01:27:41.322 --> 01:27:43.558
NEEDS OF FACULTY AND WHAT IS AN

01:27:43.625 --> 01:27:45.426
ACTION THE STATE COULD TAKE THAT

01:27:45.493 --> 01:27:47.328
WOULD REQUIRE FUNDING WHAT IS

01:27:47.395 --> 01:27:48.997
ONE THAT WOULD.

01:27:49.063 --> 01:27:51.132
SHARED GOVERNANCE COST NOTHING

01:27:51.199 --> 01:27:53.201
TO THE CSU IT'S IMPORTANT FOR

01:27:53.267 --> 01:27:55.203
THE CSU TO RESPECT THE WAYS THAT

01:27:55.269 --> 01:27:57.171
FACULTY CONSULTATION CAN INFORM

01:27:57.238 --> 01:27:59.073

01:28:07.515 --> 01:28:08.950

ADMINISTRATIVE FIATS FOR EXAMPLE

01:28:11.386 --> 01:28:13.287
WITH CHANGES IN GRADUATION

01:28:13.354 --> 01:28:16.958

01:28:17.025 --> 01:28:17.492
IN TERMS OF ONE THING THE

01:28:17.558 --> 01:28:19.394
LEGISLATION COULD DO TO SUPPORT

01:28:19.460 --> 01:28:21.229
NEEDS A FACULTY THAT DOES HAVE A

01:28:21.295 --> 01:28:23.264
COST WE NEED A LONG TERM FUNDING

01:28:23.331 --> 01:28:25.266
SOURCE TO SUPPORT. FREE PUBLIC

01:38:05.312 --> 01:38:07.281
INVOLVED IN PART TIME HIRING AND

01:38:07.348 --> 01:38:09.350
THE RATIO. THAT EXISTS BETWEEN

01:38:09.416 --> 01:38:11.385
FACULTY FULL TIME TENURE TRACK

01:38:11.452 --> 01:38:13.454
FACULTY AND A PART TIME FACULTY.

01:38:13.520 --> 01:38:15.389
IT IS CRITICAL FOR AN

01:38:15.456 --> 01:38:17.391
INSTITUTION TO HAVE A LOT OF

01:38:17.458 --> 01:38:19.126
TENURED FACULTY.

01:38:19.193 --> 01:38:21.195
BECAUSE THAT REALLY GETS TO US

01:38:21.262 --> 01:38:23.297
OF THE MISSION WE WANT WHICH IS.

01:38:23.364 --> 01:38:25.132
THAT ONLY GIVING STUDENTS THE

01:38:25.199 --> 01:38:27.067
OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE. A MENTOR

01:38:27.134 --> 01:38:29.136
AND A SUPPORTER. BUT DODD TO

01:38:29.203 --> 01:38:30.904
STABILIZE THE INSTITUTION AND

01:38:30.971 --> 01:38:31.538
OFFERINGS OF THE YEAR AND TO

01:38:31.605 --> 01:38:33.374
ACTUALLY RUN THE INSTITUTIONS

01:38:33.440 --> 01:38:35.242
YOU KNOW IF FACULTY ARE SUPPOSED

01:38:35.309 --> 01:38:37.011
TO RUN THE UNIVERSITIES WHICH

01:38:37.077 --> 01:38:39.079
THEY TELL US. WHEN YOU HAVE TO

01:38:39.146 --> 01:38:39.513
HAVE ENOUGH OF US.

01:38:39.580 --> 01:38:41.615
AS IT ALSO STILL HAVE THIS BAND

01:38:41.682 --> 01:38:43.417
A DIVINITY BUT ANYWAY WE NEED TO

01:38:43.484 --> 01:38:45.252
HAVE ENOUGH OF THEM I PUT TO BE

01:38:45.319 --> 01:38:48.922
ABLE TO SERVE ON ALL THESE

01:38:48.989 --> 01:38:49.523
COMMITTEES OTHERWISE YOU BURN

01:38:49.590 --> 01:38:49.723
OUT.

01:38:49.790 --> 01:38:49.923
AND.

01:38:49.990 --> 01:38:51.091
AND SO YOU DON'T GET THE

01:38:51.158 --> 01:38:51.792
QUALITY THAT YOU WANT THAT'S THE

01:38:51.859 --> 01:38:55.029
AS WELL AS FACULTY. A PART TIME

01:38:55.095 --> 01:38:55.729
FACULTY THAT RUNS AROUND I THINK

01:38:55.796 --> 01:38:57.398
ONE OF THE THINGS WE HAVE TO

01:38:57.464 --> 01:38:59.166
ALSO LOOK AT IS THAT I FOUND

01:38:59.233 --> 01:39:01.235
DISTURBING. I WHEN I WAS IN AND

01:39:01.302 --> 01:39:03.003
MOST IF IT'S STILL THERE I'M

01:39:03.070 --> 01:39:03.637
SURE HE IS AYE MANOMETER LONG.

01:39:03.704 --> 01:39:05.406
IS THAT WHEN WE GET READY TO

01:39:05.472 --> 01:39:07.408
HIRE PERMIT FACULTY WE GENTLY

01:39:07.474 --> 01:39:08.042
DON'T LOOK TO OUR PART TIMES TO

01:39:08.108 --> 01:39:11.078
HIRE.

01:39:11.145 --> 01:39:13.080
AT THE C. ISSUE. OF THAT AND AND

01:39:13.147 --> 01:39:14.948
AND IT'S IT WAS ALWAYS ALARMING

01:39:15.015 --> 01:39:15.282
TO ME THAT.

01:39:15.349 --> 01:39:17.351
I'D HAVE I'D MEET INDIVIDUALS

01:39:17.418 --> 01:39:19.186
WHO HAVE BEEN AT THE UNIVERSITY

01:39:19.253 --> 01:39:21.188
FOR TEN TWENTY YEARS WORKING AND

01:39:21.255 --> 01:39:23.123
SOMETIMES TEACHING FIVE AND SIX

01:39:23.190 --> 01:39:25.125
CLASSES WITH THE AVERAGE FACULTY

01:39:25.192 --> 01:39:27.027
TEACHES ABOUT TWO TO THREE.

01:39:27.094 --> 01:39:29.029
AND WHAT IT CAME DOWN TO HIRE A

01:39:29.096 --> 01:39:30.998
PERMANENT PERSON PERMIT FACULTY

01:39:31.065 --> 01:39:33.200
THEY DID NOT CONSIDER. THIS PART

01:39:33.267 --> 01:39:35.436
TIME WHO HAD A STRONG RECORD OF

01:39:35.502 --> 01:39:37.271
TEACHING. WHO MAY NOT HAVE A

01:39:37.338 --> 01:39:39.340
STRONG RECORD OF A PUBLICATIONS

01:39:39.406 --> 01:39:39.973
BECAUSE THEY WERE TEACHING SO

01:39:40.040 --> 01:39:41.375
MANY CLASSES RUNNING ALL OF THE

01:39:41.442 --> 01:39:43.377
WORLD? IT WAS RARE I MEAN

01:39:43.444 --> 01:39:47.014
ABSOLUTELY IT'S RARE WHEN A PART

01:39:47.081 --> 01:39:48.916
TIME FACULTY GOT A FULL TIME

01:39:48.982 --> 01:39:49.450
POSITION AT THE UNIVERSITY

01:39:49.516 --> 01:39:51.418
AFTER TEACHING FOR FIVE TEN

01:39:51.485 --> 01:39:52.953
FIFTEEN YEARS.

01:39:53.020 --> 01:39:55.255
AND I FOUND THAT TO BE ALARMING

01:39:55.322 --> 01:39:56.957
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S CHANGED ANY.

01:39:57.024 --> 01:39:57.157
BUT.

01:39:57.224 --> 01:39:59.326
YOU KNOW HERE'S SOMETHING

01:39:59.393 --> 01:39:59.927

01:40:05.366 --> 01:40:06.934
FACULTY POSITION

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.069
SO BEING IDENTIFIED AS AN

01:40:09.136 --> 01:40:11.105
ADJUNCT WITHOUT FACULTY IS

01:40:11.171 --> 01:40:12.973
REALLY A LIFE SENTENCE.

01:40:13.040 --> 01:40:13.574
YOU WANT TO BE THAT ADJUNCT

RESOURCES AND OF SORTS IT BUT IT

01:41:41.094 --> 01:41:41.628
IS SOMETHING I THINK THAT THE

01:41:41.695 --> 01:41:43.297
LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO CONTINUE

01:41:43.363 --> 01:41:43.630

THIS MORNING ON MY FACEBOOK PAGE

01:42:25.105 --> 01:42:27.040
AND I ASK THE QUESTION. WHY

01:42:27.107 --> 01:42:28.976
SHOULD WE WAIT ANOTHER YEAR?

01:42:29.042 --> 01:42:31.078

01:42:31.144 --> 01:42:32.980
SERIOUSNESS.

01:42:33.046 --> 01:42:34.982
I SAY THAT IN ALL SERIOUSNESS.

01:42:35.048 --> 01:42:36.984
WEEKLY SHOULD NOT HAPPEN.

01:42:43.790 --> 01:42:45.125

01:42:45.192 --> 01:42:47.027
THE IMPORTANCE OF FUNDING.

01:42:47.094 --> 01:42:49.496
I I DON'T THINK THE STUDENTS OF

01:42:49.563 --> 01:42:51.398
CALIFORNIA CAN WAIT ANOTHER YEAR

01:42:51.465 --> 01:42:53.133
AND WE'RE HEARING THAT.

01:42:53.200 --> 01:42:55.035
I THINK VERY DRAMATICALLY A

01:42:55.102 --> 01:42:55.636
THROUGHOUT THE YEARS STUDENTS

01:42:55.702 --> 01:42:57.404
CAN'T WAIT ANOTHER YEAR SO.

AND I DON'T THINK THERE'S A MUCH

01:43:27.267 --> 01:43:28.969
BY EN.

01:43:29.036 --> 01:43:31.171

HEARD.

01:43:37.144 --> 01:43:39.146
FROM PROFESSOR MCCLOUD THAT

01:43:39.212 --> 01:43:41.048
THERE HASN'T BEEN CONSULTATION

01:43:41.114 --> 01:43:42.983
THERE HASN'T BEEN CONSULTATION.

CAMINO.

01:43:51.058 --> 01:43:53.360

01:48:25.298 --> 01:48:27.300
IMPORTANT US JUST EXPRESSED TO

01:48:27.367 --> 01:48:27.934

INCARCERATED AND SYSTEM AFFECTED

01:48:39.212 --> 01:48:41.381
INDIVIDUALS WE ARE WORK WITH.

01:48:41.448 --> 01:48:43.383
FOLKS THAT ARE HOMELESS THERE

CIRCUMSTANCES IN TERMS OF THEIR

01:48:49.322 --> 01:48:50.991
SOCIAL LIFE SO. THE QUESTION

THAT WE HAVE IN FRONT OF US IS

01:48:51.725 --> 01:48:53.326
HOW DO WE BEST MOVE FROM A

01:48:53.393 --> 01:48:55.295
SYSTEM BROADLY BASED ON ACCESS

01:48:55.362 --> 01:48:57.030
AND ENROLLMENT. TOWARDS A

01:48:57.097 --> 01:48:58.932

ADDRESSING EQUITY.

01:49:03.103 --> 01:49:05.071
AND I THINK AS WELL BECAUSE WE

01:49:05.138 --> 01:49:07.073
HAVE THE THE SYSTEMS HERE ARE

01:49:07.140 --> 01:49:08.909
HOW DO WE HAVE A MORE GLOBAL

01:49:08.975 --> 01:49:11.011
INTERSECT MENTAL APPROACH ACROSS

01:49:11.077 --> 01:49:13.046
STUDENT SUPPORT SYSTEMS.

01:49:13.113 --> 01:49:13.747
BECAUSE IT'S NEEDED IN TERMS OF

01:49:13.813 --> 01:49:15.282
BUILDING A MORE STRUCTURED AND

01:49:15.348 --> 01:49:17.083
INTENTIONAL PIPELINES FOR

01:49:17.150 --> 01:49:19.085
STUDENTS THERE IS FRUSTRATION ON

01:49:19.152 --> 01:49:21.121
HOW DO WE MOVE OUR STUDENTS FROM

01:49:21.187 --> 01:49:22.923
OUR SYSTEM AS A CALIFORNIA

01:49:22.989 --> 01:49:24.991
COMMUNITY COLLEGES. INTO THE

01:49:25.058 --> 01:49:27.060
UC'S END TO THE CS USE AND

01:49:27.127 --> 01:49:29.062
ESPECIALLY IN TERMS OF CAPACITY.

01:49:29.129 --> 01:49:31.531
WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT BUILDING

01:49:31.598 --> 01:49:33.166
CAPACITY ON PROFESSIONAL

01:49:33.233 --> 01:49:33.500
DEVELOPMENT.

01:49:33.566 --> 01:49:35.335
ON LOCAL CAMPUSES NOT NOT JUST

01:49:35.402 --> 01:49:37.270
TO KNOW WHY WE NEED TO CHANGE

01:49:37.337 --> 01:49:39.272
BUT HOW TO EXTRACT CHANGE AT

01:49:39.339 --> 01:49:41.274
SCALE ESPECIALLY IN AREAS OF

01:49:41.341 --> 01:49:43.043
INTEGRATED STUDENT SUPPORT SO I

01:49:43.109 --> 01:49:45.145
HAVE FOUR MAIN POINTS I'M GOING

01:49:45.211 --> 01:49:47.147
TO FOCUS ON TODAY. ON THE FIRST

01:49:47.213 --> 01:49:47.614
ONE IS ABOUT OUR OWN

01:49:47.681 --> 01:49:49.215
TRANSFORMATIONAL DEMANDS AHEAD

01:49:49.282 --> 01:49:51.418
OF US AS THE CALIFORNIA RECALL

01:49:51.484 --> 01:49:53.520
SYSTEM. I'M WHICH MEANS THAT WE

01:49:53.586 --> 01:49:55.088
NEED INFRASTRUCTURE TOOLS

01:49:55.155 --> 01:49:57.157
SUPPORT AND TRAINING FOR

01:49:57.223 --> 01:49:59.125
ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE.

I'M IN THIS ERA OF GUIDED

01:50:01.061 --> 01:50:03.029
PATHWAYS WHICH I THINK IS.

01:50:03.096 --> 01:50:03.563
MOVING US IN THE RIGHT

01:50:03.630 --> 01:50:05.432
DIRECTION IN TERMS OF ALIGNMENT.

01:50:07.067 --> 01:50:09.069
AND TRANSFORMATIONAL WORK ON

01:50:09.135 --> 01:50:09.669
COMMUNITY COLLEGE CAMPUSES.

01:50:09.736 --> 01:50:11.438
AS WE RETHINK ABOUT HOW

01:50:11.504 --> 01:50:13.206
STUDENTS MOVE THROUGH OUR

01:50:13.273 --> 01:50:14.908
COLLEGES THERE'S GREAT NEED FOR

01:50:14.975 --> 01:50:15.342
RETRAINING STRUCTURE

AND THERE'S BEEN A BEEN A REAL

02:07:27.573 --> 02:07:29.541
SHIFT I THINK THE LAST THREE TO

02:07:29.608 --> 02:07:31.377
FIVE YEARS ABOUT THINKING ABOUT

02:07:31.443 --> 02:07:35.014

02:07:36.982 --> 02:07:39.084
WAYS AND THAT AND THAT HAS HAS

02:07:39.151 --> 02:07:41.153

MOVING FROM ENROLLMENT TO

02:07:52.998 --> 02:07:55.167

WE WERE DOING THAT ALL ALONG BUT

02:07:59.171 --> 02:07:59.738
THE WAY IN WHICH WE'RE TALKING

02:07:59.805 --> 02:08:01.340
ABOUT PERHAPS BEING FUNDED.

02:08:01.407 --> 02:08:04.943

CONVERSATIONS ON OUR CAMPUSES SO.

02:08:07.212 --> 02:08:09.148

I THINK THIS IS A THEME WE'VE

THE NATURE OF THE WORK. HOWEVER

02:17:07.285 --> 02:17:09.120
WHEN THE WORK CAN BE DONE BY ONE

HIGH TURNOVER AND MULTIPLE

02:17:31.309 --> 02:17:33.111
VACANCIES CAN ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO

02:17:33.178 --> 02:17:33.645
INCREASED WORKLOAD ON THE

ONE ACTION THAT THE STATE CAN

02:17:53.798 --> 02:17:55.066
TAKE A THAT WOULD REQUIRE FRONT.

02:17:55.133 --> 02:17:57.202

WORK IN THIS AREA THROUGH HIS

02:18:07.646 --> 02:18:09.080
LABOR MANAGEMENT INITIATIVE.

THE DISCUSSIONS ARE NOT ALWAYS

02:18:19.024 --> 02:18:19.591

IN SOME WAYS IT'S ALMOST COMMON

02:18:27.132 --> 02:18:27.699
SENSE THAT WHEN ALL EDUCATORS

THIS WOMAN HAPPENS TO BE LATINA.

03:06:31.246 --> 03:06:33.315
SHE ALSO HAPPENS TO BE A MEMBER

03:06:33.382 --> 03:06:35.350
OF THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY. AND SHE

03:06:35.417 --> 03:06:37.486
ALSO HAPPENS TO BE OVER THE AGE

03:06:37.553 --> 03:06:39.054
OF FIFTY FIVE.

03:06:39.121 --> 03:06:41.290
SHE WAS A MEMBER OF A CANDIDATE

03:06:41.356 --> 03:06:45.027

BUT THE CHOSEN CANDIDATE WAS A

03:06:51.133 --> 03:06:51.667
WHITE MALE COULD ONLY BEEN

03:06:51.733 --> 03:06:53.001
TEACHING FOR FIVE YEARS.

03:06:53.068 --> 03:06:55.003
WHO HAD A PHD IN HAND?

03:06:55.070 --> 03:06:59.074
AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW THE PHD

03:06:59.141 --> 03:06:59.641
DOES NOT NECESSARILY MAKE.

03:06:59.708 --> 03:07:01.376
A GREAT COMMITTEE BECAUSE

03:07:01.443 --> 03:07:03.011
TEACHER EVEN THOUGH I AM ONE.

03:07:03.078 --> 03:07:05.380
YEAH IT EXCEPTIONS SUCH AN

03:07:05.447 --> 03:07:07.249
ACCORD. ANOTHER ANOTHER THING I

03:07:07.316 --> 03:07:09.084
WOULD LIKE YOU TO BEAR IN MIND

03:07:09.151 --> 03:07:09.751
AS YOU WORK ON THE MASTER PLAN

03:07:09.818 --> 03:07:11.587
IS A GROUP THAT I HAD NOT HEARD

03:07:11.653 --> 03:07:14.990
MENTION TODAY. THAT OFTEN SOUNDS

03:07:15.057 --> 03:07:16.992
IS SILENT AND THAT IS THE LGBTQ

03:07:17.059 --> 03:07:19.094
COMMUNITY. WE'VE HEARD A LOT

03:07:19.161 --> 03:07:21.096
ABOUT DIVERSITY IN TERMS OF RACE

03:07:21.163 --> 03:07:22.998
WE'VE HEARD SOME ABOUT DIVERSITY

03:07:23.065 --> 03:07:23.665
AND SOCIO ECONOMIC CLASS. BUT I

03:07:23.732 --> 03:07:27.035
HAVE NOT HEARD ONE PERSON TODAY.

03:07:27.102 --> 03:07:29.137

HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES IDENTIFIED

03:07:33.275 --> 03:07:35.210
AS A MEMBER OF THAT POPULATION

03:07:35.277 --> 03:07:37.312
SO THAT IS CRUCIALLY IMPORTANT.

03:07:37.379 --> 03:07:39.147
TO WHO WE ARE.

03:07:39.214 --> 03:07:41.149

BUT WE PARTNERED WITH THE DOCTOR

03:07:47.789 --> 03:07:49.024
STUDENTS

03:07:49.091 --> 03:07:51.226

03:07:51.293 --> 03:07:53.128
POPULATIONS FEAR FOR THEIR

03:07:53.195 --> 03:07:55.097

03:07:55.797 --> 03:07:57.065

STATEWIDE GOVERNANCE.

03:12:47.255 --> 03:12:49.424
COLLEGE LEADERS SET THE TONE

03:12:49.491 --> 03:12:51.459
VALUES AND DIRECTION OF THEIR

03:12:51.526 --> 03:12:53.094

03:12:53.161 --> 03:12:53.762

03:12:53.828 --> 03:12:57.065
NOT REFLECTIVE OF THE DIVERSITY

03:12:57.132 --> 03:12:59.200
OF THE STUDENT POPULATION.

03:12:59.267 --> 03:13:01.002

03:13:09.577 --> 03:13:11.012

03:13:15.350 --> 03:13:16.985
MODELS WHO UNDERSTAND AND

03:13:17.052 --> 03:13:19.020
VALIDATE THEIR EXPERIENCES.

03:13:19.087 --> 03:13:21.156
OUR STATE AND COLLEGE LEADERS

03:13:21.222 --> 03:13:23.291
MUST GO BEYOND AN INTELLECTUAL

03:13:23.358 --> 03:13:25.126
COMMITMENT TO DIVERSITY. THAT

03:13:25.193 --> 03:13:27.228
FOR TOO LONG HAS TOLERATED.

03:13:27.295 --> 03:13:31.066
TOLERATED ITS ABSENCE.

03:13:31.132 --> 03:13:31.633

STATE.

03:13:45.146 --> 03:13:47.315
THESE POSITIONS ARE CRITICALLY

03:13:47.382 --> 03:13:49.217
IMPORTANT TO SETTING THE TONE

03:13:49.284 --> 03:13:49.684
AND DIRECTION OF THE

03:13:49.751 --> 03:13:51.086
INSTITUTIONS THEY SERVE.

03:13:51.152 --> 03:13:53.588
WE ALSO URGE THE LEGISLATURE TO

03:13:53.655 --> 03:13:57.092

THIS INCLUDES DEFINED GOALS FOR

03:14:11.306 --> 03:14:13.108
IMPROVEMENT.

03:14:13.174 --> 03:14:13.808

03:14:13.875 --> 03:14:17.045

03:15:25.080 --> 03:15:25.580
THE UC SYSTEM NEEDS TO STOP

03:15:25.647 --> 03:15:27.248
TRYING TO FIND SHORTCUTS WHEN IT

03:15:27.315 --> 03:15:28.983

I APPRECIATE EVERY SINGLE

03:16:03.251 --> 03:16:03.818
STUDENT THAT DOES TEACH THESE

03:16:03.885 --> 03:16:05.386
CLASSES BECAUSE THEY WORK ICED

03:16:05.453 --> 03:16:07.655
TEA EIGHTIES AND YOU SHOULD BE

03:16:07.722 --> 03:16:09.491

03:16:12.193 --> 03:16:12.994
PEOPLE.

03:16:13.061 --> 03:16:15.363
ON MOST OF THEM ARE MATH MAJORS

03:16:15.430 --> 03:16:17.265
IN A LOT OF THEM ARE YOU SEE

03:16:17.332 --> 03:16:18.967
VERY HAPPY BECAUSE OF THE

03:16:19.033 --> 03:16:21.136
WORKING FOR THAT BUT YOU SEE AND

03:16:21.202 --> 03:16:21.803
GETTING PAID FIFTEEN DOLLARS AN

03:16:21.870 --> 03:16:25.006
HOUR. AND.

03:16:25.073 --> 03:16:25.640
AS MUCH AS I APPRECIATE THEM

03:16:25.707 --> 03:16:27.442
THEY MAY NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES

03:16:27.509 --> 03:16:29.344
OF THE TRAINING THAT THEY NEED

03:16:29.410 --> 03:16:31.112
TO BE TEACHING OTHER STUDENTS.

03:16:31.179 --> 03:16:33.047
ON A WIDE IS THE UC SYSTEM DO

03:16:33.114 --> 03:16:35.150
THIS BECAUSE THEY CAN PAY A

03:16:35.216 --> 03:16:37.352
STUDENT HAS. BEEN THEY SHOULD BE

03:16:37.418 --> 03:16:39.287
TRAINING DAY THAN THEY SHOULD BE

03:16:39.354 --> 03:16:40.989
PAYING TRAIN SOME OF THAT'S

03:16:41.055 --> 03:16:41.623
TRAINING HAS A REQUIREMENTS FOR

03:16:41.689 --> 03:16:43.024
THIS. M..

03:16:43.091 --> 03:16:45.126
YOU KNOW THAT.

03:16:45.193 --> 03:16:49.164
A LITTLE SAD M. AND I THINK.

03:16:49.230 --> 03:16:49.764
STUDENTS WHO SERVE MORE THAN

03:16:49.831 --> 03:16:51.432
THAT THERE'S SO MANY STUDENTS

03:16:51.499 --> 03:16:53.301
HERE AND FAMILIES WHO DO

03:16:53.368 --> 03:16:55.003
EVERYTHING THAT THEY POSSIBLY

03:16:55.069 --> 03:16:57.372
CAN TO BE A YOU SEE ARE. AND THE

03:16:57.438 --> 03:16:59.407
FACT THAT SOMETIMES THEY'RE NOT

03:16:59.474 --> 03:17:01.442
GIVING US THE LEVEL OF EDUCATION

03:17:01.509 --> 03:17:03.077
WE DO SERVE IS.

03:17:03.144 --> 03:17:05.313
DISGRACEFUL AND I THINK WE NEED

03:17:05.380 --> 03:17:05.847
TO DO BETTER THAN THAT.

03:17:05.914 --> 03:17:09.050
SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS A LAB

03:17:09.117 --> 03:17:09.717
CAN REALLY IMPACT YOUR LEARNING

03:17:09.784 --> 03:17:11.619
AS ANYONE KNOWS WHEN YOU'RE IN A

03:17:11.686 --> 03:17:13.388
LAB WHERE NO DISCUSSION THAT'S

03:17:13.454 --> 03:17:15.190
WHY YOU DO MOST OF THE ACTUAL

03:17:15.256 --> 03:17:17.292
WORK WHEN. YOU'RE IN A SMALLER

03:17:17.358 --> 03:17:19.060
GROUP AND YOU CAN ASK QUESTIONS

03:17:19.127 --> 03:17:21.062
RATHER THAN YOU DO IN A LECTURE

03:17:21.129 --> 03:17:21.696
SO. IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S VERY

03:17:21.763 --> 03:17:23.298
EMPLOYMENT AND IT'S A SERIOUS

03:17:23.364 --> 03:17:24.999
ISSUE.

03:17:25.066 --> 03:17:27.302
HOME SO THAT'S JUST SOMETHING ON

03:17:27.368 --> 03:17:27.835
IT UP TO BRING UP TO NORTH

IN GIVING TOO MANY AIDS.
