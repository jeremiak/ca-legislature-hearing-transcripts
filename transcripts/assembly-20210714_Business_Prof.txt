KEY WITNESS AS WELL AS A TWENTY MINUTES TOTAL FOR ANY ADDITIONAL MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WISHING TO SIMPLY SIGNIFIED THEIR NAME. AND POSITION AGAIN SIMPLY SIGNIFYING THEIR NAME AND POSITION. WITH THOSE INSTRUCTIONS OUT OF THE WAY SENATOR RUSS PLEASE PRESENT WHATEVER READY. THANK YOU CHAIR THIS IS IN FACT THE SUNSET BILL THAT MANY HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR. IT'S THE BILL HAVING TO DO WITH THE BOARD OF BARBERING AND COSMETOLOGY IN THE NEXT CHANGES STEMMING FROM FRANKLY THE YEARS LONG SUNSET REVIEW OVERSIGHT EFFORTS. FOR THE BOARD THAT THIS COMMITTEE AND THE COMMITTEE IN THE SENATE HAVE ENGAGED IN. THE GOAL HAS BEEN AND CONTINUES TO BE FRANKLY TO BALANCE ECONOMIC MOBILITY AND EFFORTS TOWARD PROFESSIONALISM AMONG THE PERSONAL PARENTS PROFESSIONALS WITH THE NECESSARY ROLE THAT THE STATE. MUST PLAY IN MANDATING TRAINING HOURS AND REQUIRING APPROVAL FOR INDIVIDUALS TO PROVIDE. BEAUTIFICATION SERVICES IN SHORT TO ENSURE THAT INDIVIDUALS ARE PROPERLY TRAINED PROPERLY TRAINED TO ENSURE. THE PROTECTION OF CONSUMERS WHILE AT THE SAME TIME THAT WE ELIMINATE UNNECESSARY BARRIERS TO EMPLOYMENT IN THE STATE FOR OUR STATE RESIDENTS. THIS BILL UPDATES THE BARBERING AND COSMETOLOGY ACT TO REFLECT CHANGES IN THE BEAUTIFICATION SERVICES INDUSTRY OVER THE PAST NUMBER OF YEARS BY MODERNIZING THE LAW TO BETTER REFLECT NECESSARY REGULATION FOR SERVICES. THAT MAKE CARRY A RISK TO THE CONSUMER AND ALSO TO THE ARTIST PROVIDING THOSE SERVICES. THE BILL PROVIDES OUR STATE'S PERSONAL APPEARANCE ARTISTS AND PROFESSIONALS WITH THE FLEXIBILITY TO GET TO WORK QUICKLY. DOING THEIR CRAFT WITH APPROPRIATE RELEVANT TRAINING AND A CONTINUED FOCUS ON SAFETY. NOW LICENSING REQUIREMENTS ARE NECESSARY TO PROMOTE SAFETY AND PROFESSIONALISM AND THIS BILL STREAMLINES THE PROCESS THAT APPEARANCE PROFESSIONALS MUST UNDERGO IN OTHER WORDS TRAINING. THEY MUST UNDERGO IN ORDER TO LEGALLY PROVIDE BEAUTIFICATION SERVICES IN THE STATE. BY REDUCING THE REQUIRED NUMBER OF HOURS THE REQUIRED NUMBER OF HOURS FOR BARBERS AND COSMETOLOGISTS FROM FIFTEEN HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN HUNDRED HOURS RESPECTIVELY TWO ONE THOUSAND HOURS. AND THROUGH AMENDMENTS BY REGULATING HERE ONLY SERVICES AND REQUIRING TRAINING NOT LESS THAN SIX HUNDRED HOURS. THE CHANGES RELATED TO THE PRACTICAL EXAMINATION ARE INTENDED TO ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIA'S PERSONAL APPEARANCE PROFESSIONALS. DEMONSTRATE COMPETENCY COMPETENCY IN THE CURRENT ASPECTS OF THEIR PRACTICE AND THAT THEY DO SO DURING THE COURSE. OF THE TRAINING PROGRAM THAT THEY UNDERGO. NOW I MUST SAY THAT THERE HAVE BEEN MANY MANY MISCONCEPTIONS AND MYTHS ABOUT THIS BILL THAT I'VE READ ABOUT IN THE NEWSPAPERS AND LISTEN TO ON THE RADIO AND THE TELEVISION. AND THOSE QUITE FRANKLY ARE IN FACT MISCONCEPTIONS BILLS NOT SPONSORED BY CORPORATIONS THAT COME FROM THE SUNSET REVIEW PROCESS AND THE OVERSIGHT OF THE BOARD BY THIS LEGISLATURE THE BILL DOES NOT PREVENT PEOPLE FROM BEING INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS AND AS THEY CAN DO TODAY. IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH LABOR TAX OR WAGE RULES THE BOARD OF BARBERING AND COSMETOLOGY HAS NO ROLE IN WAGING LABOR CLASSIFICATION FORM ONE FORSMAN IT IS NOT PLAY A ROLE IN ENSURING THAT PEOPLE FOLLOW THE LAW AND PAY TAXES. THE BILL WILL NOT CAUSE MORE PEOPLE TO GET INFECTIONS AND BE AND BE HARMED IN FACT THE BILL INCREASES THE NUMBER OF HOURS IN INFECTION CONTROL AND DISINFECTANT AND SANITATION. TRAINING AND THE BILL WILL NOT FOR SALONS TO CLOSE. WE ALL KNOW. MANY OF US IN THIS ROOM. THAT WE TREASURE OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR HAIR STYLIST IN THIS BILL DOES NOT. CHANGE THAT. THE BILL WILL STILL ENSURE THAT STUDENTS LEARN SAFELY AND SAFETY NECESSARY TO PROTECT THEMSELVES AND THEIR CLIENTS. ONE THOUSAND HOURS OF SCHOOL IS REQUIRED IN MANY STATES. VERMONT TEXAS RHODE ISLAND REQUIRES SIX HUNDRED HOURS. AND ALLOWS THE PROFESSIONALISM AND SAFETY LEARN IN SCHOOL TO STILL BE ACQUIRED IN THAT STATE AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT WILL BE REQUIRED HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I AM HAPPY TO ACCEPT ALL OF THE AMENDMENTS LISTED IN THE ANALYSIS. AND APPRECIATE YOUR PARTNERSHIP SURE LOW AS WE CONTINUE TO WORK ON THESE IMPORTANT ISSUES NOT ONLY TODAY. BUT OVER THE NEXT SIX TO EIGHT WEEKS INCLUDING. FURTHER CLARIFYING THAT BOARD LICENSEES ARE NOT MASSAGE THERAPISTS. AUTHORIZING STUDENT EXPERIENCE TO GET PAID AND PARTICIPATE IN THAT PROGRAM FOR UP TO TWENTY FIVE HOURS PER WEEK. AFTER COMPLETING ONLY 25% OF COURSE INSTRUCTION WHICH OF COURSE IS DOWN FROM THE SIXTY PERCENT. THE CURRENT LAW REQUIRES. FOLLOWING THE LEAD IN THE GOOD WORK OF YOUR COLLEAGUE ASSEMBLY MEMBER PATTERSON. FINALLY RESPONDING THE LICENSEES FROM THROUGHOUT THE STATE ABOUT CONCERNS THAT HER CUTTING SHOULD REMAIN LICENSE. AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THESE AMENDMENTS TO. IN THIS BILL. AT THE APPROPRIATE POINT IN TIME SURE I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK. FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON THIS MEASURE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH JIM AND ROTH AND FOR ALSO ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE MAINTENANCE. WILL NOW MOVE ON TO PRIMARY WITNESS IN SUPPORT OF A LIMIT THAT TESTIMONY TO MANAGE PER INDIVIDUAL.

IN PERSON. OPPOSITION OF ALL THEN BY OPPOSITION ON THE TELEPHONE LINE SO OPERATOR WHICH WE PLEASE GO TO THE- PRIMARY TWO WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. WILL ALSO LIMIT YOUR PUBLIC TESTIMONY TO NO MORE THAN TWO MINUTES FOR THE PRIMARY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION ON THE LINES. PARDON ME ASSURE I ONLY SHOW THE TWO WITNESSES IN PERSON. OKAY OKAY GO TO THE TO BEAR WITH THIS IS IT IN PERSON PLEASE- YOUR NAME AFFILIATION AND NO MORE THAN TWO MINUTES WELCOME THANK YOU. I AM GOING TO SETTING ALSO I AM THE FOUNDER OF BARBERS ASIDE WITH OVER FORTY THOUSAND MEMBERS I'M A BARBER SHOP OWNER IN AN INDUSTRY ORGANIZER FROM LOS ANGELES AS YOU HEARD US ADDITIONS ARE IN SUPPORT OF SB EIGHT OR THREE BECAUSE IT STRENGTHENS OUR LICENSE AND SCOPE OF PRACTICE. BUT LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT IT DOES TO THE BARBER AND COSMETOLOGIST AS VITA THREE PRESENTS ITSELF AS WELL INTENTIONED SUGGESTING THE BARRIER OF ENTRY INTO THE BEAUTY PROFESSION BE LOWERED AND MADE MORE ACCESSIBLE TO INDIVIDUALS WANTING TO ENSURE THE TRAIT WHICH RAISE THE QUESTION WHAT INDUSTRY DO THESE FUTURE PROFESSIONALS. BE ENTERING A HUNDRED YEARS AGO TRADESPEOPLE IN THIS PROFESSION ORGANIZED CREATING EDUCATION REGULATION LICENSING AND STANDARDS TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC AND WORKERS THIS INDUSTRIES MAJORITY SMALL BUSINESSES OWNED AND OPERATED BY UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES THAT INCLUDE PEOPLE OF COLOR IMMIGRANTS WOMEN VETERANS AND LGBT Q. PLUS. FOR OVER A CENTURY HAS ALLOWED US TO HAVE OWNERSHIP OPPORTUNITIES THAT TRANSLATE TO EQUITY IN THE MARKET THE CORPORATIONS AND BILLIONAIRES SUPPORTING THIS BILL WILL SLOWLY TAKE THAT AWAY FROM MICRO SMALL BUSINESSES AND SMALL BUSINESSES AS A TAKE OVER A LARGER PART OF OUR MARKET SHARE. BY SUPPORTING REGULATIONS A LOWER HOURS IN TRAINING THIS NOT ONLY DIMINISHES OUR PROFESSIONALISM BUT COMPROMISES OUR LIVELIHOODS THE COMPANIES BEHIND. THIS BILL IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. ONLY HAVE ONE GOAL IN MIND AND THAT'S TO MASS PRODUCE TECHNICIANS TO FILL THEIR SHOPS THAT STRUGGLE TO RETAIN PROFESSIONALS CURRENTLY. THE NUMBER ONE REASON WHY PROFESSIONALS DON'T WANT TO WORK FOR CORPORATIONS IS THAT THEY'RE LIMITED IN IN IN THE EARNING POTENTIAL. THEY WORK FOR A SYSTEM THAT TAKES FIFTY TO SIXTY. OF THEIR EARNINGS IN ADDITION TO STATE AND FEDERAL TAXATION CORPORATION SUPPORTING. LOWER TO LOWER THE BARRIERS OF ENTRY WILL ALLOW THEM TO HAVE. A BIGGER POOL OF EMPLOYEES TO HIRE. BUT WHAT THEY FAIL TO THINK ABOUT IS WHAT IT WILL DO TO THE FUTURE OF OUR PROFESSION. WE SAW WAS STARBUCKS DID TO THE LOCAL COFFEE SHOP. WHAT AMAZON DID TO THE LOCAL BOOKSTORE AND NOW WE'RE ASKING FOR THE SAME THING TO NOT. BE DONE TO LOCAL SALONS AND BARBERSHOPS. TO SOME THIS GRASS. THIS CRAFT HAS BEEN PASSED DOWN FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION. FOR OTHERS WILL COME FROM TOUGH BACKGROUNDS THIS WAS THEIR ONLY SHOT TO MAKE SOMETHING OF THEMSELVES. NO MATTER HOW WE GOT HERE WE ALL SHARE THE SAME LOVE GRATITUDE AND ADMIRATION FOR TRADE. AND WHAT THE FUTURE OF OUR INDUSTRY TO CONTINUE TO BENEFIT FROM THE WORK LAID OUT BY OUR PREDECESSORS. AND ENSURE THAT THE MAJORITY OF THE MARKET SHARE BE TAKEN UP BY THE PEOPLE WHO TRULY MAKE UP THIS BEAUTIFUL INDUSTRY. AND NOT BE HANDED OVER TO A HANDFUL OF BILLIONAIRES. SO I ASK YOU TODAY PUBLIC SERVANTS AND OFFICIALS TO LOOK BEYOND THE INTERESTS OF CORPORATIONS WHO ALREADY HAVE A LOT AND ARE TRYING TO GET MORE. GET AND LOOK AFTER THE LIVELIHOODS OF YOUR CONSTITUENTS. AYE OPPOSED. SB ZERO THREE. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WELL NOW MOVE ON TO THE FINAL PRIMARY WITNESS IN OPPOSITION CHRIS TELL US IF YOU GET A MAJOR TEST MY TO NO MORE THAN TWO MINUTES WELCOME GOOD AFTERNOON I'M CHRIS TELUS CALIFORNIA COLLEGE OF BARBERING AND COSMETOLOGY I'M HERE REPRESENTING SEVERAL THOUSAND BARBERSHOPS SALONS IN OVER TWO HUNDRED FORTY VOCATIONAL SCHOOLS THAT OVERWHELMINGLY OPPOSE THIS BILL. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THIS INDUSTRY IS PRIMARILY COMPOSED OF INDEPENDENT WORKERS WORKERS WHO CAN MOVE FREELY BETWEEN JOBS RENT A CHAIR OR OPEN A SALON BEAUTY SERVICES PEPSI HISTORICALLY BEEN A SANCTUARY FOR WOMEN PEOPLE OF COLOR AND MEMBERS OF THE LGBTQ PLUS COMMUNITY ALLOWING THEM TO PROSPER IN A WORLD THAT HAS PROVIDED FEW OPPORTUNITIES AND MANY IMPEDIMENTS. THIS IS BECAUSE IN BEAUTY SERVICES THERE IS NO ESTABLISHED HIERARCHY TO HOLD YOU BACK. HOWEVER AS IT INDEPENDENT DISAGGREGATED WORKFORCE THERE IS NO OPPORTUNITY FOR BEAUTY SERVICE PROFESSIONALS TO UNIONIZE. THE FULL TRAINING AND LICENSE THEREFORE IS A FORM OF UNIONIZATION PROVIDING PROTECTION. FOR THESE PROFESSIONALS SO THAT THEY CAN MAKE GOOD WAGES AND MOVE UP THE ECONOMIC LADDER. LAST WEEK I UP LOADED FOR YOUR PACKET THE HIGHLY REGARDED TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN STUDY FROM THE NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH BY PETER BLAIR OF HARVARD. AND BOBBY JOHN FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO WHICH CONFIRMED THAT OCCUPATIONAL LICENSING REDUCES THE RACIAL PAY GAP BY UP TO FORTY THREE PERCENT. THE MISSION OF THIS STUDY BY STAFF UNDERLIES THE APPALLING LACK OF DATA OR CONSTITUENT CONSULT CONSULTATION BEHIND THIS LATE. THIS LEGISLATION. EIGHTY THREE CALLS FOR REDUCING THE HOURS REQUIRED TO GET A LICENSE BUT IF THE YOU LOWER THE HOURS WHAT YOU ACTUALLY GET IS A FLOOD. DRIVING DOWN WAGES FOR AN ALREADY EMBATTLED POPULATION. AND ONCE AGAIN YOU HAVE A CASE WHERE ENTITLED ELITE ATTEMPTS TO IMPOSE REFORMS ON A MINORITY POPULATION THAT WAS NOT CONSULTED AND DOES NOT WANT IT. IT IS YET ANOTHER TIME ONE CASE OF WE KNOW WHAT'S BEST FOR YOU. IT IS PATRONIZING AND INSULTING TO THE HARD WORKING ESTABLISHED PROFESSIONALS IN THIS INDUSTRY. ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THE LEGISLATOR IS BASED ON EMOTION AND STEREOTYPES NOT RESEARCH OR REASON. WORST OF ALL YOU HAVE A BUNCH OF PEOPLE WITH ADVANCED DEGREES TELLING WOMEN AND MINORITIES THAT THE BARRIER TO EMPLOYMENT IS TOO MUCH EDUCATION. UNBELIEVABLE WHAT IS GOING ON HERE WHERE IS THE SCIENCE THIS WILL DUMB DOWN THE TRAINING AND DRIVE DOWN WAGES ONLY FOUR STATES OUT OF FIFTY ONE HAVE A THOUSAND OUR PROGRAMS AND THOSE FOUR DO NOT HAVE THE MULTI CULTURAL POPULATION. OF CALIFORNIA. NOW THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT THE INDUSTRY THE REGULATIONS AND THE CURRICULUM NEED REFORM WE SEE THAT. WE WANT TO BE INVOLVED IN IT BUT THIS IS NOT THE BILL. THIS BILL WILL BACKFIRE ON ITS OWN INTENTIONS SO WE ASK YOU TO TABLE SB EIGHT OH THREE. AND ALLOW FOR FURTHERS FURTHER STUDY. WE RESPECTFULLY ASK THAT YOU STOP THIS BILL AND ALLOW US TO WORK TOGETHER TO CRAFT MEANINGFUL REFORM LEGISLATION. AGAIN WE WANT YOU TO BE OUR HEROES WE NEEDED WORK WITH US NOT AGAINST US. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR- PRIMARY WITNESS IN OPPOSITION. WILL NOW MOVE ON TO THE PORTION OF THE MEETING FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO SIGNIFY THEIR OPPOSITION HERE IN THE CHAMBERS AND IN THE GALLERY.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE NOW CONCLUDES THE PORTION OF THE HEARING IN WHICH WE HEARING PUBLIC TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION. WELL NOW MOVES TO THE COMMITTEE FOR ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE TO THE AUTHOR AND JUST AS A REMINDER THERE IS A DO PASS RECOMMENDATION ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER. ASSEMBLY MEMBER GIPSON. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FOR CERTAINLY HAS SPARKED A GREAT CONVERSATION- HERE TODAY AND APPRECIATE OF THOSE WHO TESTIFIED WHETHER IN SUPPORT OR AGAINST I JUST HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS FROM THE AUTHOR BECAUSE I RECEIVED AS I'VE BEEN SITTING HERE RECEIVING TEXTS FROM INDIVIDUALS MY DISTRICT ADDISON MIXED AND SO DOES THE SOME CLARIFICATION AS RELATES TO- THIS PROPOSAL ONE HOW DID- WE DO DERIVE FROM. CITY REDUCING FROM SIXTEEN HUNDRED HOURS TO ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS AND THEN DOES THAT DIMINISH ANY KIND OF WAY WITH RESPECT TO THE TRAINING BECAUSE OF SIXTEEN HOURS FOR A STUDENT TO GO THROUGH TO GET THEIR LICENSE AND NOW WE'RE GOING TO REDUCE IT TO ONE THOUSAND HOURS- WHAT IS THE MECHANISMS TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU KNOW THAT TOP THE SIX THE SIX HUNDRED HOURS ABSOLUTELY- CAPTURED AND TRAINING IS NOT DIMINISHED TO A QUICK. INDIVIDUAL SPECIAL AROUND SAFETY. AND AN OTHERWISE MOVING FORWARD. WELL IN FIRST PLACE BOTH THE CURRENT LAW AND THIS BILL. THE STANDARD IS NOT LESS THAN SO UNDER THE CURRENT LAW IT'S NOT LESS THAN. SIXTEEN HUNDRED HOURS UNDER THIS BILL IT'S NOT LESS THAN ONE THOUSAND HOURS. THE QUESTION IS WHAT ARE THE STUDENTS DOING FOR SIXTEEN HUNDRED HOURS. IN COSMETOLOGY COSMETOLOGY PROGRAM OR FIFTEEN HUNDRED HOURS INTO BARBERING PROGRAM. V. THIS LEGISLATOR LEGISLATURE AND THE COMMITTEES BOTH IN THE ASSEMBLY AND THE SENATE HAVE BEEN ASKING THAT QUESTION FOR YEARS. AND WE HAVE ASKED THE INDUSTRY TO PARTICIPATE WITH US IN THE SCHOOLS THAT ARE INVOLVED. IN ASSESSING THE PROGRAMS AND THE CURRICULUM REQUIREMENTS AND THE REASON AND THE RATIONALE FOR SIXTEEN HUNDRED HOURS FOR COSMETOLOGIST. WITHOUT RESULT. AND IN FACT THE RESPONSE THAT WE HAVE RECEIVED. EACH AND EVERY TIME WAS SIXTEEN HUNDRED HOURS IN THE CASE OF COSMETOLOGISTS FIFTEEN HUNDRED HOURS FOR BARBERS. IS APPROPRIATE. AS WE IN CALIFORNIA HAVE WATCHED THESE PARTS OF THE REST OF THE COUNTRY RHODE ISLAND VERMONT NEW YORK TEXAS TEXAS. STEADILY REDUCING THE NOT LESS THAN HOURLY REQUIREMENT. AS I MENTIONED VERMONT TEXAS A THOUSAND HOURS RHODE ISLAND SIX HUNDRED HOURS NEW YORK ABOUT A THOUSAND OR SO CERTAINLY LISTEN SIXTEEN HUNDRED HOURS AND WE STAY THE SAME. SO THIS TIME WE ASK AGAIN. NO RESPONSE FROM INDUSTRY AS YOU'VE HEARD EXCEPT- COMPLAINTS AND REQUESTED A REMAIN THE STATUS QUO IN THE BOARD WORKED WITH US THIS TIME TO IN FACT DETERMINE THAT A THOUSAND HOURS APPEARED APPROPRIATE WITH AN INCREASE BY THE WAY IN THE MANNER TRAINING. SPECIFIED FOR DISINFECTION AND SANITATION BECAUSE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE COSMETOLOGY TRAINING CURRICULUM AND YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBER OF HOURS THAT ARE REQUIRED FOR ITS SANITATION AND DISINFECTING. AND I FORGET WHETHER WAS TWENTY OR SIXTY OR MAYBE A HUNDRED I'D HAVE TO LOOK. I DON'T THINK IT WAS THAT MUCH FOR THAT PARTICULAR A SEGMENT OF HEALTH AND SAFETY YOU WOULD BE SURPRISED AND YOU WOULD SAY IF YOU'RE SPENDING SIXTEEN HUNDRED HOURS IN A CURRICULUM. AND THIS IS AN INDUSTRY WERE INTERESTED IN CONSUMER PROTECTION WHY WOULDN'T YOU SPEND MORE TIME. WORKING ON. DISINFECTION AND SANITATION AND SO. IT APPEARED TO AT LEAST SOME OF US THAT A THOUSAND HOURS. WHAT'S UP WAS APPROPRIATE CERTAINLY CERTAINLY APPROPRIATE VERMONT TEXAS NEW YORK. WE ASK THE BOARD THE BOARD- AGREED WITH US. SUBJECT TO THE LIMIT THE AMENDMENTS THAT WE'VE TAKEN IN THIS BILL. SO WE DON'T THINK. WE ME DON'T THINK THAT THIS IS GOING TO IMPACT HEALTH AND SAFETY CONSUMER PROTECTION OR FRANKLY THE TRAINING OF THE STUDENTS IN THE SCHOOLS AND I THINK YOU ALL ARE WELL AWARE THAT STUDENTS PAY A FAIR AMOUNT OF MONEY FOR THE SCHOOLS THAT CAN BE UPWARDS OF FIFTEEN THOUSAND TWELVE TO FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR TRAINING PROGRAM SO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE HOURS REQUIRED. WE SAID IT RIGHT. BECAUSE IT CAN BE A BARRIER TO EMPLOYMENT. IF THE COSTS ARE HIGH THE HOURS ARE EXCESSIVE AND THAT'S WHAT. ASSEMBLY MEMBER THAT WE WERE TRYING TO DO HERE AND IF WE HAVEN'T FOR NOT GETTING IT RIGHT. WE'LL CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS ISSUE TO GET IT RIGHT WE OWE IT TO THE STUDENTS WHO ARE INTERESTED IN CAREERS IN BARBERING AND COSMETOLOGY. AND ALL OF THE OTHER FEELS REGULATED BY THIS PARTICULAR BOARD. CENTER THANK YOU VERY MUCH I APPRECIATE YOUR RESPONSE. I HAVE OTHERS ONE ADDITIONAL QUESTION- BECAUSE WHEN I GO GET MY HAIR CUT. THAT WAS A JOKE. OF THE REAL QUESTION IS WITH THE REDUCTION IN HOURS- AFFECTS STUDENTS- THAT MOVED OUT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA MOVED INTO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA NO SHOULD NOT AFFECT THEM AT THAT HAS TO DO WITH THE TESTING REQUIREMENTS IN THIS THAT THE OTHER AND WILL MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS. THAT THERE IS ABILITY AND MOBILITY WITH RESPECT TO BARBERING AND COSMETOLOGY BUT IT'S NOT MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE WILL BE ANY ANY ANY ADVERSE IMPACT THANK AND IF IT TURNS OUT THAT THERE IS WILL FIX THAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ASSEMBLY MEMBER ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS AT THIS TIME. I SEE NO DIGITAL- QUESTIONS COMMENTS AT THIS TIME I JUST WANT TO AGAIN REMIND INDIVIDUALS WHO HAD- WE'VE BEEN ON THE PHONES THAT THEY CAN ALSO SUBMIT THEIR COMMENTS TO THE COMMITTEE BY EMAIL OR THROUGH THE ONLINE PORTAL FOR ME TO GET MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WHO DO NOT GET TO TESTIFY. DUE TO TIME CONSTRAINTS FEEL FREE TO SUBMIT YOUR COMMENTS TO THE COMMITTEE BY EMAIL. OR THROUGH THE PORTAL. ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS COMMENTS HAVE BEEN MEMBERS AT THIS TIME SEE NON. KEVIN ROTH TO WISH TO CLOSE THANK YOU CHAIR LET ME JUST MAKE A COUPLE COMMENTS TO ADDRESS THOSE WHO SPOKE BOTH HERE AND OUTSIDE. OUTSIDE THE CHAMBER I WANT TO ASSURE THEM THAT- THOSE THAT ARE EVER INVOLVED WITH THE OPPOSITION THAT BIG CORPORATIONS HAVE NOT BEEN INVOLVED IN DRAFTING. THE PROVISIONS CONTAINED IN THE SUNSET BILL. A RATHER WAS A VERY DEDICATED TEAM OF STAFFERS BOTH HERE IN THE ASSEMBLY AND IN THE ASSEMBLY AND THE SENATE. WHO WORKED ON IT THIS YEAR AND HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THESE ISSUES. FRANKLY FOR YEARS. N. AS TO THOSE WHO SAY THAT. QUESTION WHETHER YOU KNOW REGULATION. CAN SERVE AS A BARRIER TO EMPLOYMENT I THINK IT'S PRETTY CLEAR IN THEIR NUMEROUS STUDIES THAT. GOVERNMENT REGULATION OF BUSINESS AND OCCUPATIONS CAN SERVE AS A BARRIER TO EMPLOYMENT BOTH IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ACROSS THE NATION. AND WE REGULATE TO PROTECT CONSUMERS AND TO ENSURE THAT STUDENTS. RECEIVE THE TRAINING THEY NEED AND DESERVE. WITHOUT UNNECESSARY BARRIERS SUCH AS EXCESSIVE TRAINING REQUIREMENTS OR IN SOME CASES EXCESSIVE. TUITION NO MORE. AND NO LESS AND AS I MENTIONED TO THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER IN MY RESPONSE. YOU KNOW I I'M DELIGHTED THAT WE HAVE INDUSTRY REPRESENTATIVES PARTICIPATING IN THIS DISCUSSION TODAY. FRANKLY THESE COMMITTEES HAVE BEEN REQUESTING THE INDUSTRY AND THOSE INVOLVED WITH IT INCLUDING THE SCHOOLS. TO WORK WITH US TO REVIEW THE SPECIFIC TRAINING HOURS REQUIRED. IN LIGHT OF ADVANCING TECHNOLOGY. BUT WITHOUT RESULT AS I INDICATED OTHER THAN. THE RESPONSE OF THE STATUS QUO IS OKAY SO WITH THE BOARD'S HELP WE MOVE FORWARD WITH THAT EFFORT THIS YEAR. TO PROVIDE THE ANALYSIS AND OF COURSE YOU SEE THE RESULT NOW I WANT TO STATE ON THE RECORD THAT I WILL COMMIT TO WORK WITH THOSE STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING THOSE WHO SPOKEN TODAY. AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS BILL TO TRY TO DO THE WORK THAT WE HAVE BEEN REQUESTING FRANKLY FOR YEARS. AND WITH THAT MISTER CHAIR I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH JIM ROTH- OF HERSELF IT TO LIGHT I WOULD LIKE TO. COMMEND AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS ISSUE- MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC IN MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE WELL NO THAT YOU'VE SERVED AS CHAIR OF THE SENATE BUSINESS PROFESSIONS COMMITTEE JUST STARTING THIS YEAR.

EIGHT ZERO THREE. SENATOR ROTH WILL NOW MOVE ON TO OUR FINAL ITEM THIS IS SENATE BILL. EIGHT ZERO SIX FILE ITEM NUMBER SIX. HE'S PREFERRED PRESERVATIVE READY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THIS IS THE SUNSET BILL FOR THE MEDICAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA HEALING ARTS THE CHANGES IN THIS BILL STEM FROM A SUNSET REVIEW OVERSIGHT PROCESS INCLUDING TWO RECENT PUBLIC HEARINGS AS THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON BUSINESS PROFESSIONS IN THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON BUSINESS PROFESSIONS HELLO THIS YEAR O DISCUSS THIS IMPORTANT REGULATORY BODY IN THE VERY IS VERY IMPORTANT ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH IT. I WITHOUT THIS BILL TODAY THIS MEDICAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA WILL EXPIRE THE BILL EXTENDS THE BOARD'S OPERATIONS FOR TWO YEARS THE MEDICAL BOARD'S ENFORCEMENT PROCESS STARTING WITH HAVE COMPLAINTS FROM THE PUBLIC ARE HANDLED STRETCHING ALL THE WAY TO THE END OF THE BOARD AND ITS MEMBERS MAKES DECISIONS ABOUT LICENSEE DISCIPLINE HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF SIGNIFICANT CONCERN. AND QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS AND THE PUBLIC ALIKE INCLUDING A RECENT LOS ANGELES TIMES NEWSPAPER ARTICLE TODAY SIGNIFICANTLY SB EIGHT OH SIX PROPOSES ENFORCEMENT MONITOR AT THE MEDICAL BOARD TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE INDEPENDENT INFORMATION AND REPORTS ABOUT WHAT IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING AT THE MEDICAL BOARD. WITH REGARD TO A VARIETY OF ISSUES INCLUDING THE DISCIPLINARY PROCESS INFORMATION THAT I HOPE WILL PROVIDE GUIDANCE ON THE NECESSARY NEXT STEPS TO SUPPORT THE MEDICAL BOARD'S IMPORTANT WORK. THE MEASURE ALSO REINSTATES THE MEDICAL BOARD'S AUTHORITY I SAY AUTHORITY TO RECOVER COSTS ACCRUED DURING ENFORCEMENT CASES. THIS CHANGE HAS BEEN REQUESTED BY THE MEDICAL BOARD ITSELF FOR MULTIPLE SUNSET REVIEWS OVER A PERIOD OF YEARS. AND IS LIKELY TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL REVENUE TO OFFSET COSTLY BUT NECESSARY DISCIPLINARY ACTION. MEMBERS I KNOW YOU KNOW THIS BUT THE MEDICAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA IS INSOLVENT AND HAS NOT HAD AN ADJUSTMENT TO INCREASE RESOURCES TO SUPPORT BART OPERATIONS FOR ALMOST FIFTEEN YEARS. THE BILL INCREASES FEES FOR ALL MEDICAL BOARD LICENSEES AND REGISTRANTS AND INCLUDES LANGUAGE TO ENSURE PROPER LEGISLATIVE REVIEW OF THIS PROGRAMS FUNDED CONDITION IN THE COMING YEAR AND THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL FEES. ALL IN ANTICIPATION OF A FURTHER AND MORE DETAILED FINANCIAL ANALYSIS PREPARED BY THE BOARD ITSELF. ANALYZING EXPENSES AND REVENUE MANAGEMENT OPERATIONS AND IMPROVEMENTS THAT COULD BE ACHIEVED. SENATE BILL EIGHT OH SIX TAKES THE FIRST STEP IN RESOLVING ISSUES THAT POSITION GROUPS AND HEALTH CARE PRESENT FACILITIES HAVE IDENTIFIED ABOUT REQUIREMENTS FOR LICENSURE. DURING PHYSICIAN PARTICIPATION IN POST GRADUATE TRAINING CORPS PROGRAMS A VERY VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE. THE LAW ESTABLISHED THROUGH PRIOR SUNSET REVIEW OVERSIGHT OF THE MEDICAL BOARD AT THE BOARD'S REQUEST AND WITH THE LEGISLATURE'S APPROVAL NOW REQUIRES A PHYSICIAN TO COMPLETE THIRTY SIX MONTHS. OR RECEIVE CREDIT FOR THIRTY SIX MONTHS OF POST GRADUATE TRAINING. THREE YEARS IS THE SHORTEST RESIDENCY PROGRAM AND MANY PHYSICIANS COMPLETE MANY MORE THAN THIRTY SIX MONTHS. AS AMENDED. SB EIGHT OH SIX NOW INCLUDES PLACEHOLDER LANGUAGE THAT WILL CONTINUE TO TAKE SHAPE OVER THE NEXT. TWO MONTHS OR SO TO AUTHORIZE A POSITION TO BECOME LICENSED AS A FULL SCOPE PHYSICIAN AND SURGEON AFTER THE PHYSICIAN AND SURGEON COMPLETES TWELVE MONTHS OF A RESIDENCY PROGRAM EXACTLY AS IT WAS BEFORE THE LAW CHANGE WAS ADOPTED IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. THE POSITION A SURGEON WOULD THEN HOLD THAT LICENSE AND ONLY BE ELIGIBLE TO RETAIN AND RENEW IT UPON RECEIVING THIRTY SIX MONTHS CREDIT. FOR POST GRADUATE TRAINING. FAMILY OR MEDICAL LEAVE OR OTHER NECESSARILY WILL STILL BE ACCOMMODATED. FOR RESIDENT PHYSICIANS AND POST GRADUATE TRAINING RECEIVE FOR THE LEAVE PERIOD JUST AS THE BILL CURRENTLY PROVIDES OUR GOAL IS TO SEND A BILL TO THE GOVERNOR THE PROVIDES THE MEDICAL BOARD WITH THE TOOLS AND DIRECTION TO ENSURE SWIFT OUTCOME FOR CASES. MOST ESPECIALLY CASES INVOLVING ALLEGATIONS OF SIGNIFICANT DEVIATION FROM THE STANDARD OF CARE THAT RESULTED IN PATIENT HARM. THIS LEGISLATIVE PROCESS IS JUST THAT A PROCESS AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU WOULD SURE LOVE WITH THE MEDICAL BOARD WITH PATIENCE AND WITH PHYSICIANS. TO MAKE MEANINGFUL CHANGES WERE NECESSARY AND TO GET THIS RIGHT. AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR RIVAL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SURE ROTH. WILL NOW MOVE ON TO PRIMARY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT WILL LIMIT THE TESTIMONY TO NO MORE THAN TWO MINUTES. PER INDIVIDUAL FOR PUBLIC TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT OPERATOR WOULD YOU PLEASE OPEN UP THE LINES FOR PRIMARY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU WE DO HAVE AARON BROWN ON THE LINE PLEASE GO AHEAD. HELLO GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS BILL PACIFICA I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE MEDICAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA HAS INDICATED IN THE ANALYSIS THE BOARD HAS ADOPTED A SUPPORT YES AMENDED POSITION ON SB EIGHT OH SIX. FIRST THE BOARD IS GRATEFUL THAT SB EIGHT OH SIX RESTORES THE BOARD'S AUTHORITY TO OBTAIN RECOVERY OF ITS INVESTIGATION AND PROSECUTION COSTS RELATED TO DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS AGAINST ITS POSITION LICENSEES THIS WHITE WOODS PUTS US ON A PAR WITH OTHER TCA BOARDS. AND IS EXPECTED TO HELP SUPPORT THE TIMELY RESOLUTION OF THE BOARD'S DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS AND MEDICATE CERTAIN ENFORCEMENT EXPENSES FURTHER THE BOARD SUPPORTS CREATING AN ENFORCEMENT MONITOR AND HOPE THAT THIS WILL ADD GREATER TRANSPARENCY TO THE PROCESS. AND THAT THERE ARE REPORTS WILL HELP TO SPUR- ENHANCEMENTS TO THE BOARD'S AUTHORITY AND RESOURCES THAT FURTHER ITS CONSUMER PROTECTION MISSION. THE BOARD WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS TO ESTABLISH THE AMOUNT THAT WILL ADEQUATELY SUPPORT THE BOARD'S OPERATIONS AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING WITH THAT WORK IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO.

FIRST I WANT TO START BY THANKING THE AUTHOR- SENATOR ROTH AS CHAIR OF THE SENATE AND- BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS COMMITTEE FOR TAKING THE TIME TO MEET WITH ME TO DISCUSS SOME OF THE PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL. SPECIFICALLY CONCERNING THE POST GRADUATE TRAINING LICENSE. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO THANK THE CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE AND STAFF ARE ALSO TAKING THE TIME TO SPEAK WITH ME AND OTHERS ABOUT THIS ISSUE. AS YOU KNOW SENATOR RON. I ALONG WITH MANY OTHERS HAVE SERIOUS CONCERNS. ABOUT THE UNINTENDED YET PROBLEMATIC CONSEQUENCES. OF OUR EXISTING POST GRADUATE TRAINING LICENSE REQUIREMENTS. IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THE LEGISLATURE ESTABLISH THE POST GRADUATE TRAINING LICENSE WHICH CREATED BARRIERS FOR OUR POSITION RESIDENTS TO PROVIDE THE BEST CARE POSSIBLE FOR THEIR PATIENTS. IT ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY LIMITED OUR MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS FROM RECEIVING TIMELY PRIMARY CARE DUE TO THE INABILITY OF OUR RESIDENT PHYSICIANS TO MOONLIGHT AND COMMUNITY CLINICS. ALTHOUGH I HOPE THAT I WOULD HAVE SEEN THE SPECIFIC LANGUAGE IN THIS BILL TO RESOLVE THESE OBSTACLES THAT WERE PUT IN PLACE BY THE PTO. I KNOW THAT AMENDMENTS CONTAINING INTENT LANGUAGE TO RESOLVE THIS WENT INTO PRINT TODAY. AS A MEMBER OF APPROPRIATIONS I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING A RESOLUTION ON THE PTO ISSUE IN THAT COMMITTEE WHEN WE RETURN FOR SUMMER RECESS. I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL TODAY TO ENSURE THAT THE MEDICAL BOARD CAN CONTINUE ITS GOOD WORK OF PROTECTING CONSUMERS. AND BECAUSE OF THE INTENT LANGUAGE ON THE PTL ISSUE. I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING THE RESOLUTION THAT SOLVE THESE REAL IMPACTS THAT ARE EXISTING LICENSURE FRAMEWORK. HAS ON OUR CURRENT AND PROSPECTIVE WORK FORCE AND SAFETY NET CLINICS. THANK YOU CHAIR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH DR WEBER. EXCEPT ASSEMBLY MEMBER FONG. I THINK IT WAS CHAIR OF FIRST ALLIED OFFICER THEY WANT TO APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS BY MY BY MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO- AND THE WORK- BY YOUR DOCTOR- BY. BY YOUR CHAIR ROTH WITHOUT THE WORK YOU'RE PUTTING INTO WORKING OUT A SOLUTION TO THE POST GRADUATE LICENSING- REPORTED ALSO SEE THE SPECIFICS. WHICH I THINK ARE IMPORTANT TO INCREASE ACCESS TO- HEALTHCARE IN MY AREA I JUST REAL COMMUNITIES- AND HOSPITALS. SO CERTAINLY APPRECIATE- YOUR COMMITMENT TO THAT I DID WANT TO- MOVE TO AND FOCUS MORE ON THAT THE COP THEM FORTUNATE MECHANISMS AND THE CONCERNS- ROUND THAT I BELIEVE IN OUR LAST- CENSORED HEARING ON THIS- YOU. OUTLINED SOME CONCERNS UNDER EXAMPLES THAT YOU'VE HEARD- I THINK- A CHIRLA ALSO YOU KNOW HAD EXAMPLES OF. OF- A BAD ACTORS- THAT- I THINK- WERE NOT- PROPERLY REVIEWED AND- AND ADMONISHED BY THE MEDICAL BOARD SO I WOULDN'T WANT TO AT LEAST GET YOUR THOUGHTS ON. THE SPECIFICS OF THE ENFORCEMENT PROVISIONS IN THIS BILL- HOW THE DISPARATE ACTIONS ARE CAN BE MORE ROBUST. AND IF YOU COULD ADDRESS- IS OF THE COMPANY LETTERS OF- THAT I THINK THE- MADE AWAY- YOU KNOW HOW THAT GOING TO OPERATE. I KNOW THAT I HAVE A NUMBER OF. IN TO- THAT HAVE BEEN. TO HAVE CONCERN ABOUT THAT'S WHY LIKE TO SEE GET GET YOUR- ON THAT. CERTAINLY OF. WHAT WE HEARD WAS OF COURSE. INFORMATION THAT WAS PASSED ON THAT WASN'T NECESSARILY PASSED ON TO US BY THE MEDICAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA. I'M NOT AN EXPERT ON THIS BUT IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING CERTAINLY I'VE BEEN TOLD THAT THE PROBLEMS HAVE TO DO WITH PHYSICIANS AND PHYSICIAN DISCIPLINE AND THEIR DESIRE. OBVIOUSLY WELL PLACED TO HAVE CONFIDENTIALITY REGARDING THESE CASES AND SO WHEN WE ASK ABOUT THE CASE INCLUDING OF A TRAGIC CASE THAT WAS THAT WAS DETAILED OF OVER SOME PERIOD OF TIME DURING OUR HEARING THE TOOK OVER A MATTER OF TEN OR ELEVEN YEARS TO GET TO THE ACCUSATION- WHEN I ASK QUESTIONS WE SENT A LETTER IS FOR RESPONSE WE'RE TOLD- THE CASES IN LITIGATION IT'S A CONFIDENTIAL. MATTER AND WE CAN'T PROVIDE YOU ANY INFORMATION. SO I'VE NOT BEEN ON THIS BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS TRAIN. BEFORE THIS YEAR THIS IS MY FIRST RODEO BUT WHAT I HAVE DECIDED IS IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO COME UP WITH A FIX PARTICULARLY WITH THE MEDICALBOARD AND WITH PHYSICIANS. WHEN WE CAN'T GET TO THE DATA TO DECIDE WHETHER THE PROCESS IS GOOD BAD OR INDIFFERENT WHETHER THE CASES ARE BEING SETTLED PROPERLY OR IMPROPERLY BECAUSE WE CAN'T GET THE DATA REGARDING THE PHYSICIAN MISCONDUCT. INVOLVED REDACTED OR OTHERWISE. AND SO WITH RESPECT TO THE PUBLIC MEMBER PROCESS SOME OF YOU MAY KNOW. WE I PUT THE PUBLIC MEMBER PROVISION IN THE SENATE BILL INITIALLY BECAUSE I THOUGHT THAT WAS THE WAY TO GO. BUT WHAT I CONCLUDED WAS WE HAVE PUBLIC MEMBERS ON THE MEDICAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA. NOT JUST THE MAJORITY. THEY'RE NOT A MAJORITY BUT WE HAVE PUBLIC MEMBERS AND PART OF THE PROCESS IS THE PUBLIC MEMBERS ON THE MEDICAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA ARE NOT INVOLVED IN THE ENFORCEMENT PROCESS FROM THE BEGINNING. THEY'RE INVOLVED AT SOME LATER STAGE OF THE PROCESS AND THE QUESTION IS THE ENTIRE PROCESS DOES THE ENTIRE PROCESS WORK IS IT EFFECTIVE. WE ALSO LEARNED AS YOU MAY RECALL THAT THEY SETTLE. I DON'T KNOW 82% OF THEIR CASES IN. EIGHTY SOMETHING PERCENT OF THE OF THOSE CASES THE SETTLEMENTS FAILED TO MEET. THE DISCIPLINARY GUIDELINES THAT THE MEDICAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA PUBLIC ITSELF PROMULGATED AND PUBLISHED. SO WE NEED TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THAT WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHY THAT IS WHY THEY HAVE A HIGH SETTLEMENT RATE WHY MORE ARE TRIED. AND WHEN THEY DO HAVE A SETTLEMENT RATE WHY DON'T THE SETTLEMENTS MEET THE DISCIPLINARY GUIDELINES. ADDING ONE OR TWO. OR THREE PUBLIC MEMBERS TO THE BOARD SINCE THEY'RE NOT INVOLVED IN THE INTER DISCIPLINARY PROCESS I DON'T THINK GETS IS THERE AND SO. WE DECIDED YES THERE'S BEEN AN ENFORCEMENT MONITOR IN THE BOARD LONG BEFORE MY TIME BUT WE DECIDED TO PUT AN ENFORCEMENT MATTER INTO THE BOARD. WITH THE PROCESS THAT HOPEFULLY HAS SOME TEETH ON IT IN IT AND IF IT DOESN'T WE'LL PUT SOME TEETH TO IT. REQUIRE PERIODIC REPORTS AND A FINAL REPORT SO WE CAN GET TO THE BOTTOM OF HOW THIS ENFORCEMENT PROCESS THE MEDICAL BOARD WORKS. AND WHETHER THE MEDICAL BOARD IS IN FACT TAKING APPROPRIATE. DISCIPLINARY ACTION AGAINST PHYSICIANS WHO VIOLATE THE STANDARD OF CARE ONE BECAUSE SOME OF ITS MEDICAL MALPRACTICE ALLEGATIONS. THE STUFF YOU HEARD ABOUT TODAY OVER THE- ON THE REMOTE TESTIMONY. AND SOME OF IT HAS TO DO WITH PHYSICIAN MISCONDUCT ALCOHOL ABUSE SUBSTANCE ABUSE- LACK OF HONESTY IN TERMS OF IMPORTANT ISSUES THE LEAST IMPORTANT MEDICAL BOARD A WHOLE VARIETY OF OTHER THINGS AND WE NEED TO ANALYZE THAT SO HOPEFULLY. THIS ENFORCEMENT MONITOR PROCESS WILL GET TO THE HEART OF THAT WILL PROVIDE US THE DATA THAT WE NEED IN THIS COMMITTEE. IN THE ASSEMBLY AND THE SENATE COMMITTEE IN BUSINESS PROFESSIONS TO MAKE SOME DETERMINATION AND SOME ADJUSTMENT WITH RESPECT TO THE WAY THIS. MEDICAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA WORKS AND THEN AT THAT POINT IN TIME. WE CAN ONCE AGAIN ADDRESSED THE ISSUE A PUBLIC MEMBERSHIP BECAUSE REMEMBER THIS IS NOT THE ONLY. HEALING ARTS BOARD IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND IF THIS BOARD NEEDS PUBLIC MEMBERS SO TO THE OTHER BY A PUBLIC MEMBER MAJORITY SO TO THE OTHER BOARDS. IN CALIFORNIA WE MUST WILL TACKLE THOSE TWO. THAT I'M CLOSE TO ANSWERING YOUR QUESTION SIR YES IT DID- I DID WANT TO- DID YOU ENVISION THE INDEPENDENT FOR SOME WATER TO HAVE- MORE RESPONSIBILITY HOW DOES IT COMPARE TO- PREVIOUS- AND FOR SOME WATER SO I WASN'T HERE SO LIKE I WASN'T HERE EITHER SO I CAN'T ADDRESS THAT BUT WHAT WE WHAT I MEAN BUT WE INTEND IS THAT THE ENFORCEMENT MINOR HAVE FULL ACCESS TO THE PROCESS. LIKE DATA ANALYZED APPROPRIATENESS. INAPPROPRIATENESS PRESSES THESE THAT NEED TO BE CHANGED. AND PROVIDE US A REPORT AND WHAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FIGURE OUT IS HOW WE GET THE SPECIFIC DATA WITHOUT GETTING THE- WITHOUT BREACHING THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF THESE PERSONAL MATTERS THE COMPANY. THAT YOU KNOW THE DISCIPLINE CASES INVOLVE POSITIONS BUT WE'RE GONNA NEED TO CRACK THAT NUT BECAUSE WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND. WHY THE SETTLEMENT RATES HIGH Y. THE WHY THE DISCIPLINARY GUIDELINES ARE MET. N. Y. MORE CASES ARE TRIED MAYBE THERE. WAS A MAYBE THERE'S A REASON MAYBE THEY'RE TAKING TOO MANY COMPLAINTS COMPLAINTS THAT DON'T REALLY HAVE- GRAVITAS IT. AT ALL LEVELS AND THEN THEY SETTLE THEM THEY CAN'T THEY CAN I DON'T KNOW I DON'T THINK ANY OF US. AND TO GET TO THE LETTER OF ADVICE THAT WE REQUEST BY. THE BOARD PERHAPS TO HIM THOSE. LOW LOW LEVEL. VIOLATE YOU KNOW THAT DON'T NECESSARILY NEED THE MORE FORMAL PROCESS WHERE YOU HAVE AN INVESTIGATION ACCUSATION INVOLVEMENT BY THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND ALL THE REST WHICH DRIVE FRANKLY DRIVES UP THE COST AND IN APPROPRIATE CASES THAT PROCESS SHOULD BE FOLLOWED AND IN APPROPRIATE CASES CASES SHOULD BE TRIED BUT WE NEED TO SORT OF TRIAGE THIS AND THAT THAT WAS THE RATIONALE FOR THE BOARD'S REQUEST FOR THE LETTER OF ADVICE. FIVE I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE ANSWER I KNOW I AGREE WITH YOU I THINK YOU'VE I'VE I THINK YOU'VE HIGHLIGHTED ALL THE KEY CHALLENGES THAT WE NEED TO FOCUS ON THE DATA IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT SO I KNOW YOUR COMMITMENT TO PATIENT SAFETY SO- I WOULD LOOK FOR TO WORKING WITH YOU IN TERMS OF MAKING OF LOOKING AT THE DATA AND SEEING THAT WE HAVE TO MAKE THE AND THE ENFORCEMENT PROVISIONS MORE OF US THANK YOU VERY MUCH WELL I WOULD JUST THAT I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT. THE LETTER OF VICE THE LETTER OF ADVICE PROCESS WAS NOT INCLUDED TO CLOSE CLOSE THIS DISCIPLINARY PROCESS IN IN ANY MORE SECRECY THAN THAN IT. SEEMS TO HAVE SO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ASSEMBLY MEMBER FONG ASSEMBLY MEMBER CUNNINGHAM. THANK YOU MISTER JR. CENTER I HAD A COUPLE QUESTIONS RELATING TO THE COST RECOVERY FEES. MY FIRST QUESTION IS IT. UNDER THIS BILL WITH THE COST RECOVERY. PAUL ALTERNATELY ON THE PHYSICIAN OR ON THE POSITIONS- MALPRACTICE INSURANCE CARRIER I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT I WOULD SUSPECT THAT IT HAS TO DO WITH THE MALPRACTICE POLICY PROVISIONS BUT I DON'T REALLY KNOW. AND THE COST RECOVERY OBVIOUSLY APPLIES WHEN THERE'S- WHEN SOMEBODY'S LOST. YES RECOVER COSTS SO THE IF YOU YOU KNOW IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY APPLY IF YOU SETTLE A CASE UNLESS THERE'S SOME AGREEMENT SO IF 82% OF YOUR COMPLAINTS ARE SETTLED. IF THAT REMAINS A STATISTIC I DON'T KNOW THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A HUGE NUMBER OF CASES BUT ONCE AGAIN I'M GUESSING TO SOME EXTENT WE ASK FOR SOME PROJECTIONS ON REVENUE RECOVERY ASSOCIATED WITH. WITH THE COST RECOVERY PRESENT A PROVISION IN. THE DATA THAT WE WERE PROVIDED AT LEAST IN AN INFORMAL WAY SUGGESTS THAT IT'S IN THE LOW MILLIONS OF DOLLARS POTENTIALLY. OKAY SO I'M CURIOUS AS TO YOUR RESPONSE TO THAT I GUESS CMA'S CONCERN THEY REYES WHICH- STRIKES ME AS IT MIGHT BE A WELL FOUNDED CONCERN WHICH IS THE SENSE THAT. THE COSTSOF THE INVESTIGATIONS ARE HARD TO KNOW UP FRONT AND CAN BE HIGHLY VARIABLE AND SOME OF THEM. I'M ASSUMING FROM WHAT THEY SAY CAN BE VERY. EXPENSIVE BY INSERTING A COST RECOVERY BACK IN THE SCHEME- OR THE SYSTEM I SHOULD SAY- ARE YOU CREATING AN INCENTIVE FOR PEOPLE TO. LEVERAGE THE POTENTIAL OF AN EXPENSIVE COST RECOVERY THAT'S GOING TO BE THE BILL FOR WHICH WILL BE LAID. AT THE POSITION STORE OR THEIR CARRIER ONE OF THE TWO- JAHRBUCH ARE. ARE IS THAT COULD BE ABUSED IN A WHERE'S OUR POTENTIAL FOR ABUSE TO LEVERAGE. PEOPLE INTO JUST RESOLVING TO GET IT DONE BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO END UP WITH. A HIGH SIX FIGURE BILL FOR THE INVESTIGATIVE COSTS WELL THEY DON'T HAVE IT NOW REMEMBER AND THESE THE THEY'RE SETTLING I DON'T REMEMBER FOUR PERCENT. 84% OF THE CASES NOW SO I DON'T KNOW. THAT THAT CMA CONCERN HAS ANY LEGS FRANKLY. OKAY THAT'S THAT'S FAIR I LOOK AT THE SETTLEMENT PIECE ACTUALLY FROM THE MAYBE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT'S EVIDENCE THAT THE SYSTEM ISN'T WORKING. I MEAN GENERALLY ACROSS ALL SORTS OF. TYPES OF- DISPUTES I MEAN- A HIGH SETTLEMENT RATE IS. OFTEN A GOOD SIGN. RIGHT I MEAN YOU KNOW PEOPLE ARE RESOLVING THEIR THEIR THINGS WITHOUT. EXPENSIVE LONGER JUDICATA PROCESS OF IT WELL I THINK IF I CAN RESPOND I MEAN. THE SUNSET REVIEW HEARINGS AND YOU HAD CASES WHERE. THE POSITION RECEIVED A LETTER OF REPRIMAND AND IT WAS A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CASES I'M REMEMBERING. YOU HAVE PHYSICIANS WHO PERHAPS GOT A LETTER RECEIVED A LETTER OF REPRIMAND OR WHATEVER THE- WHATEVER THE TERM IS- IN CASES WHERE. THERE WAS AN ADMITTED TO INSTANCE OF- OF DISHONESTY. SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT I DO KNOW IS THE MEDICAL BOARD ITSELF HAS TOLD US. THAT IN A HIGH PERCENTAGE OF THOSE SETTLEMENT CASES THE DISCIPLINARY GUIDELINES WHATEVER THEY CALL THEM. VETERAN REGULATION THAT THEY PROMULGATED. WE'RE NOT. ONE OR MORE THE CENTRAL ISSUE CENTREPOINT NOT SATISFIED SO THEY'RE NOT MEETING THEIR OWN DISCIPLINARY GUIDELINES IN THE DISCIPLINE THAT THEY'RE IMPOSING. IN SETTLEMENT SO. THAT MAY BE A PROBLEM IT'S CERTAINLY INDICATED BY SOME OF THE TELEPHONE CALLS THAT IN TESTIMONY THAT WE RECEIVED HERE IN THAT WE RECEIVED DURING THE SUNSET REVIEW BUT WE NEED TO LOOK AT THAT I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION. TO DRAW A CONCLUSION MYSELF AND I SUSPECT YOU WILL FEEL THE SAME. I APPRECIATE YOUR ANSWERS THANK YOU. I WILL NOT ON THE COST RECOVERY THAT THE IRONY OF. THE CMA'S POSITION IS NOT LOST ON ME. OPPOSED TO COST RECOVERY WHICH HAS SOME REVENUE GENERATING POTENTIAL IN TERMS OF THOSE CASES THAT DRAG ON. PERHAPS BECAUSE OF PHYSICIANS DRAGOMAN. AND AT THE SAME TIME ARGUING AGAINST A FEE INCREASE FOR MEDICAL BOARD THAT IS IN SELF. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. EDUCATIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS AT THIS TIME. SEIGNER ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS AT THIS TIME. EMIRATI WISH TO CLOSE. D. WELL LET ME JUST IF I COULD MAKE ONE OTHER POINT TO THOSE OF LICENSED MIDWIVES I UNDERSTAND THE CONCERN AND THE INTEREST IN ESTABLISHING A ON A NEW LICENSED. MIDWIFERY BOARD OF FRANKLY THOUGH WE NEED TO DO MORE FINANCIAL ANALYSIS- TO ENSURE THAT THE LICENSE FEES THAT THE LICENSED MIDWIVES. ARE GOING TO PAY ARE WILLING TO PAY OR SUFFICIENT TO FUND THE BOARD BECAUSE OF YOU ALL KNOW THESE BOARDS ARE SPECIAL FUNDED. AND NOT GENERAL FUND AND THE LICENSEES HAVE TO SUPPORT THE GOVERNMENT OPERATION THAT WE SET UP SO I PLEDGE TO THOSE WHO CALLED AND I PLEDGE TO DO THAT I'M NOT SURE LOW JOINS ME IN THAT IT WILL TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT THIS AND SEE WHAT WE NEED TO DO. SO WITH THAT HELLO- THIS BILL IMPORTANTLY CONTINUES NOT ONLY THE OPERATIONS OF THE MEDICAL BOARD WITH THE OSTEOPATHIC MEDICAL BOARD THE PODIA TRICK MEDICAL BOARD AND THE PHYSICIAN ASSISTANT BOARD. STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO RESPECTFULLY US FOR NOT VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SHARON ROTH- AGAIN I'D LIKE TO COMMEND YOU. FOR TAKING ON THIS.

ALSO LIKE TO THANK THE ADVOCATES AND PATIENTS WHO HAVE BEEN IN CONTACT WITH OUR RESPECTIVE OFFICES. PARTICULARLY THOSE WHO HAVE. EXPERIENCED GREAT LOSS. DUE TO MAKE A MEDICAL NEGLIGENCE. MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE WILL ALSO RECALL THAT WE HAVE HAD MULTIPLE OVERSIGHT HEARINGS. IN WHICH WE'VE EXPRESSED CONSIDERABLE FRUSTRATIONS WITH THE MEDICAL BOARD'S FAILURE TO BE. PROACTIVE AND PROTECT PATIENTS. AND IN FACT JUST THIS MORNING IN THE LA TIMES ARTICLE. FOUND THAT NEARLY OUT OF THE NINETY THOUSAND COMPLAINTS AGAINST DOCTORS. OVER THE PAST DECADE LESS THAN HALF A PERCENT RESULTED IN A LICENSE. REVOCATION THIS OF COURSE IS EITHER A STATISTICAL ANOMALY. OR COMPLETE FAILURE BY THE MEDICAL BOARD TO TAKE ACTION TO PROTECT EVERYDAY CALIFORNIANS. AND NOW WE ARE NOT ADDRESSING A NUMBER OF OUTSTANDING ISSUES I KNOW. GERMAN ROTH AND I STAND DEEPLY COMMITTED. TO ADDRESSING THOSE ISSUES MOVING FORWARD. BUT LET'S MAKE IT VERY CLEAR THAT WHILE WE ARE EXTENDING THE BOARD. SENSE AT EXTENSION FOR TWO YEARS. THE BOARD IS CERTAINLY NOT OFF THE HOOK. I KNOW THAT SHERMAN ROSS SHARES THE DEEP COMMITMENT TO ENSURING STRONG OVERSIGHT. OVER THE COMING YEARS AND WILL CONTINUE TO MAN ANSWERS. BUT THE RESPECTIVE. CHAIRS AND COMMITTEE STAFF ALONG WITH MEMBERS OF THESE COMMITTEES. I ALSO WANT TO ENSURE AND ENCOURAGE AND REAFFIRMED HIS. COMMENTS BY DR WEBER AND ADDRESSING OUTSTANDING ISSUES AND I KNOW THAT WILL COLLECTIVELY. WORK OUT THOSE ISSUES AS IT CONTINUES TO MOVE FORWARD. AS WELL AS A HAVING REPORTS FROM INDEPENDENT.
