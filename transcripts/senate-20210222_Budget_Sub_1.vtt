STAND FOR. I'M ENGLISH LEARNER

00:29:28.666 --> 00:29:30.468
PROFESSION GROUP PROFICIENCY

00:29:30.535 --> 00:29:35.206
PROCESS THANK YOU. A. M. THEN

00:29:35.273 --> 00:29:39.444
ARM. IT THE OTHER THING THAT I

00:29:39.511 --> 00:29:41.513
WAS TRYING TO UNDERSTAND IT AND

00:29:41.579 --> 00:29:44.415
WHAT YOU SAID IS THIS THE

00:29:44.482 --> 00:29:45.783
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAVE TO

00:29:45.850 --> 00:29:48.586
GRANT A WAIVER FOR THE STATE TO

00:29:48.653 --> 00:29:52.524
SUSPEND ASSESSMENTS OR IS IT

00:29:52.590 --> 00:29:54.959
JUST THE STATE DOES ASSESSMENTS

00:29:55.026 --> 00:29:56.461
AS PER STATE LAW THEY CAN

00:29:56.528 --> 00:29:58.396
SUSPENDED ON THE STATE LEVEL

00:29:58.463 --> 00:29:59.297
BUT THEY DON'T GET TO REALLY

00:29:59.364 --> 00:30:01.366
SUSPENDED UNTIL THE FEDS GRANT

00:30:01.432 --> 00:30:03.668
A WAIVER IS THAT CORRECT THAT

00:30:03.735 --> 00:30:05.470
IS CORRECT IT REQUIRES BOTH

00:30:05.537 --> 00:30:08.339
OKAY. SODA IF THE GOVERNOR DID

00:30:08.406 --> 00:30:09.741
AN EXECUTIVE ORDER WHICH SHE

00:30:09.807 --> 00:30:11.276
DID IT JUST DOESN'T REALLY TAKE

00:30:11.342 --> 00:30:14.345
AFFECT UNTIL THE OF THE FEDS

00:30:14.412 --> 00:30:15.947
GRANT THE WAIVER ON TOP OF IT

00:30:16.014 --> 00:30:17.382
THAT IS CORRECT AND HOW LONG

00:30:17.448 --> 00:30:18.816
HAS IT TAKEN THE FEDS TO DO

00:30:18.883 --> 00:30:22.053
AWAY FOR IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS

00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:23.254
PANDEMIC. IT DEPENDS ON THE

00:30:23.321 --> 00:30:25.590
TYPE OF WAIVER THE AND BITES-

00:30:25.657 --> 00:30:26.824
THE LAST WAIVER THAT THEY

00:30:26.891 --> 00:30:29.260
ISSUED WAS STREAMLINED WAIVER

00:30:29.327 --> 00:30:32.330
WHICH AT THEIR INVITATION.

00:30:32.397 --> 00:30:34.465
BASED SIGNALED THROUGH STATES

00:30:34.532 --> 00:30:36.467
THAT IF WE SUBMITTED THIS

00:30:36.534 --> 00:30:38.169
WAIVER IT WOULD BE GRANTED

00:30:38.236 --> 00:30:40.805
ONLY. IF THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN

00:30:40.872 --> 00:30:41.906
THEN WE WOULD HAVE TO GO

00:30:41.973 --> 00:30:42.907
THROUGH A GENERAL WAIVER

00:30:42.974 --> 00:30:45.410
PROCESS AND THAT PROCESS COULD

00:30:45.476 --> 00:30:47.445
TAKE MONTHS. AND THEN IT'S

00:30:47.512 --> 00:30:49.847
EXPECTED THAT FOR THE NEXT

00:30:49.914 --> 00:30:51.950
SCHOOL YEAR. EVERYTHING WILL

00:30:52.016 --> 00:30:55.186
COME BACK IT SUGGESTED WE WILL

00:30:55.253 --> 00:30:58.056
ALL MAKE AN ASSESSMENT AT THE

00:30:58.122 --> 00:30:59.123
BEGINNING OF THE SCHOOL YEAR

00:30:59.190 --> 00:31:00.925
WHETHER THERE'S SOMETHING FROM

00:31:00.992 --> 00:31:02.360
THE PANDEMIC THAT STILL IN

00:31:02.427 --> 00:31:05.063
EFFECT WOULD CAUSE. A REASON

00:31:05.129 --> 00:31:07.198
NOT TO COME BACK FULLY IN THE

00:31:07.265 --> 00:31:09.500
ASSESSMENTS IN THE DASHBOARD IS

00:31:09.567 --> 00:31:12.136
THAT RIGHT. THAT IS CORRECT FOR

00:31:12.203 --> 00:31:13.738
THIS NEXT YEAR BUT THAT'S ALSO

00:31:13.805 --> 00:31:16.074
CORRECT READ THIS YEAR AS WELL

00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:18.076
SO I AT THIS TIME WE ARE

00:31:18.142 --> 00:31:20.745
CURRENTLY PENDINE- ANY WAIVER

00:31:20.812 --> 00:31:22.347
FROM THE U. S. DEPARTMENT OF

00:31:22.413 --> 00:31:24.782
EDUCATION WE ARE MOVING FORWARD

00:31:24.849 --> 00:31:27.552
WITH ASSESSMENTS. NO I'M NOT

00:31:27.619 --> 00:31:29.287
INTERESTED IN THIS YOU MEAN FOR

00:31:29.354 --> 00:31:30.321
THE CURRENT SCHOOL YEAR WERE

00:31:30.388 --> 00:31:32.857
IN. YES THAT WAS GREAT HOW CAN

00:31:32.924 --> 00:31:34.859
A AND IS THAT BASED ASSESSMENTS

00:31:34.926 --> 00:31:36.694
AFTER DISTANCE LEARNING IS THAT

00:31:36.761 --> 00:31:39.731
BASICALLY WIDE ASSESSMENTS ARE

00:31:39.797 --> 00:31:43.001
CONTINUING. AND GOING TO DO IT.

00:31:43.067 --> 00:31:45.503
I'M SORRY. THE SCHOOLS OF

00:31:45.570 --> 00:31:46.904
OVERWHELMINGLY BEEN AND

00:31:46.971 --> 00:31:48.139
DISTANCE LEARNING SO IT'S

00:31:48.206 --> 00:31:49.907
REALLY AN ASSESSMENT IN GENERAL

00:31:49.974 --> 00:31:51.309
OF DISTANCE LEARNING OF THE

00:31:51.376 --> 00:31:53.911
SUCCESS OR THE PROGRESS MADE AS

00:31:53.978 --> 00:31:56.147
A RESULT OR NOT MADE AS A

00:31:56.214 --> 00:31:58.116
RESULT OF DISTANCE LEARNING.

00:31:58.182 --> 00:32:00.018
YES IT WOULD IT WOULD BE A

00:32:00.084 --> 00:32:01.252
SIMILAR TALL ASSESSMENTS

00:32:01.319 --> 00:32:02.654
ACTUALLY I WOULD SAY WITH THE

00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:04.122
SUMMIT IF IS THAT IT WOULD BE

00:32:04.188 --> 00:32:05.189
AN ASSESSMENT OF TEACHING AND

00:32:05.256 --> 00:32:07.158
LEARNING AND FOR THIS YEAR WITH

00:32:07.225 --> 00:32:09.427
IN THE CONTEXT OF KOPEN. AND

00:32:09.494 --> 00:32:11.195
WILL THERE BE SOME SPECIAL

00:32:11.262 --> 00:32:13.831
VALUE TO THAT BECAUSE- THERE

00:32:13.898 --> 00:32:19.137
CAN BE A TRUE ASSESSMENT OF.

00:32:19.203 --> 00:32:19.704
DISTANCE LEARNING AND IF. IT

00:32:19.771 --> 00:32:21.639
GOT FOR BID BUT BUT IF I WAS

00:32:21.706 --> 00:32:23.508
EVER A TIME WE HAD TO DO

00:32:23.574 --> 00:32:25.510
DISTANCE LEARNING AGAIN. THE

00:32:25.576 --> 00:32:27.879
ASSESSMENT WOULD GIVE US A READ

00:32:27.945 --> 00:32:30.815
ON HOW TO WEAR THE DEFICIENCIES

00:32:30.882 --> 00:32:33.851
WERE IN DISTANCE LEARNING. WE

00:32:33.918 --> 00:32:35.186
WOULD HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTAND

00:32:35.253 --> 00:32:36.354
OF THAT UNDERSTANDING OF THAT

00:32:36.421 --> 00:32:38.656
OF ONCE WE COLLECT THE DATA TAT

00:32:38.723 --> 00:32:39.791
TO SEE THIS THE WHAT THE

00:32:39.857 --> 00:32:41.726
VALIDITY AND RELIABILITY OF THE

00:32:41.793 --> 00:32:42.427
DATA WOULD BE BUT THAT IS OUR

00:32:42.493 --> 00:32:45.129
WHOLE. THANK YOU. AND THEN LET

00:32:45.196 --> 00:32:46.464
ME ASK THE COLLABORATIVE A

00:32:46.531 --> 00:32:48.933
QUESTION BECAUSE- AND I DIDN'T

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:50.368
KEEP A LIST OF THE SCHOOLS YOU

00:32:50.435 --> 00:32:51.836
TALKED ABOUT TWO SCHOOLS THAT

00:32:51.903 --> 00:32:54.505
YOU DID TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE.

00:32:54.572 --> 00:32:56.107
TO ONE FOR WYO I REMEMBER THAT

00:32:56.174 --> 00:32:57.942
BECAUSE I'M- PROBABLY THE ONLY

00:32:58.009 --> 00:32:59.177
MEMBER OF THE LEGISLATURE

00:32:59.243 --> 00:33:00.411
THAT'S PRODUCT OF THE HIGHER

00:33:00.478 --> 00:33:02.447
PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM. AND THEN

00:33:02.513 --> 00:33:04.415
YOU SAID FOR THAT YOU'RE DOING

00:33:04.482 --> 00:33:07.151
AND R. ONE WAS SALINAS. WHAT

00:33:07.218 --> 00:33:09.320
DID YOU LEARN FROM THE

00:33:09.387 --> 00:33:11.022
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE YOU

00:33:11.089 --> 00:33:12.824
OFFERED TO THOSE FIRST TWO.

00:33:12.890 --> 00:33:14.992
THAT WILL HELP YOU WITH THE

00:33:15.059 --> 00:33:16.561
NEXT FOR THAT YOU MIGHT NOT

00:33:16.627 --> 00:33:20.231
HAVE KNOWN. WHEN YOU STARTED

00:33:20.298 --> 00:33:21.299
OUT DOING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE.

00:33:21.366 --> 00:33:22.600
SHIN SO WE'VE LEARNED A LOT

00:33:22.667 --> 00:33:23.801
FROM WORKING WITH INGLEWOOD

00:33:23.868 --> 00:33:25.370
UNIFIED AS WELL AS VALLEJO CITY

00:33:25.436 --> 00:33:28.106
UNIFIED- PRIMARILY WHAT WE

00:33:28.172 --> 00:33:29.874
FOUND IS THAT THERE'S A LOT OF

00:33:29.941 --> 00:33:31.242
EFFORT THAT NEEDS TO BE

00:33:31.309 --> 00:33:33.378
PROVIDE- THAT ME SO CURRENT.

00:33:33.444 --> 00:33:36.280
AND BUILDING CAPACITY- ON

00:33:36.347 --> 00:33:38.316
EITHER HE INSTRUCTIONAL SYSTEMS

00:33:38.383 --> 00:33:39.317
AND STRUCTURES THAT MAYBE

00:33:39.384 --> 00:33:40.585
THEY'VE BEEN MISSING SO THINGS

00:33:40.651 --> 00:33:41.486
LIKE WHAT ARE YOUR

00:33:41.552 --> 00:33:42.887
INSTRUCTIONAL PRIORITIES WHAT

00:33:42.954 --> 00:33:44.822
ARE YOUR BENCHMARKS AND TARGETS

00:33:44.889 --> 00:33:46.057
AND HOW DO WE START TO REALLY

00:33:46.124 --> 00:33:47.091
ENGAGE IN CONTINUOUS

00:33:47.158 --> 00:33:48.793
IMPROVEMENT CYCLES. TO MAKE

00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:49.594
SURE THAT YOU'RE MAKING THE

00:33:49.660 --> 00:33:53.431
PROPER HE CAME TO- ACHIEVE. THE

00:33:53.498 --> 00:33:54.332
OTHER THING WE HAVE FOUND IS

00:33:54.399 --> 00:33:56.534
THAT PROFESSIONAL LEARNING OR

00:33:56.601 --> 00:33:58.436
KINDS OF SUPPORTS FOR TEACHERS

00:33:58.503 --> 00:33:59.871
REALLY SHOULD BE GROUNDED ON A

00:33:59.937 --> 00:34:01.506
FEW PARTIES TOO OFTEN MANY OF

00:34:01.572 --> 00:34:02.673
OUR DISTRICTS ARE TRYING TO

00:34:02.740 --> 00:34:04.008
TAKE ON A LOT OF DIFFERENT

00:34:04.075 --> 00:34:05.276
THINGS. AND WHEN YOU'RE TRYING

00:34:05.343 --> 00:34:06.144
TO ADDRESS SOME ISSUES OF

00:34:06.210 --> 00:34:07.745
EQUITY A REALLY REQUIRES YOU TO

00:34:07.812 --> 00:34:09.280
LOOK AT THE OVERALL

00:34:09.347 --> 00:34:10.882
INSTRUCTIONAL QUALITY BUT THEN

00:34:10.948 --> 00:34:12.183
TRY TO SEE WHAT NEEDS TO BE

00:34:12.250 --> 00:34:13.584
UNIQUE FOR CERTAIN STUDENT

00:34:13.651 --> 00:34:15.186
GROUPS. AND SO BUILDING THEIR

00:34:15.253 --> 00:34:16.154
CAPACITY WORKING WITH THEIR

00:34:16.220 --> 00:34:19.424
TEACHERS TO BE ABLE TO- LEARN

00:34:19.490 --> 00:34:20.691
WHAT WOULD BE THE BEST

00:34:20.758 --> 00:34:22.293
PRACTICES TO BENEFIT THOSE

00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:24.429
STUDENTS PRIMARILY. WE'VE ALSO

00:34:24.495 --> 00:34:26.164
FOUND THAT SOME PROCEDURES FOR

00:34:26.230 --> 00:34:27.432
EXAMPLE ESPECIALLY FOR STUDENTS

00:34:27.498 --> 00:34:29.167
EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS WE

00:34:29.233 --> 00:34:31.736
FIND THAT. WE MAY NEED TO

00:34:31.803 --> 00:34:33.404
ESTABLISH STRONGER PROCEDURES

00:34:33.471 --> 00:34:34.772
THAT OCCUR ALL YEAR LONG RATHER

00:34:34.839 --> 00:34:35.940
THAN AT THE TIME OF

00:34:36.007 --> 00:34:36.974
REGISTRATION OR THINGS LIKE

00:34:37.041 --> 00:34:38.209
THAT TO ENSURE THAT THOSE

00:34:38.276 --> 00:34:38.810
STUDENTS WHO NEED THOSE

00:34:38.876 --> 00:34:40.478
SUPPORTS THE MOST. OF THEM

00:34:40.545 --> 00:34:41.979
THROUGHOUT THE YEAR RATHER THAN

00:34:42.046 --> 00:34:43.181
AT CERTAIN PERIODS OF TIME IN

00:34:43.247 --> 00:34:45.016
THE YEAR- AND THEN I WOULD SAY

00:34:45.082 --> 00:34:46.651
LASTLY THE OTHER THING WE HAVE

00:34:46.717 --> 00:34:48.586
FOUND IS THAT WE NEED TO ALSO

00:34:48.653 --> 00:34:50.154
INVEST IN SOME ADDITIONAL

00:34:50.221 --> 00:34:51.923
RESOURCES THAT EITHER ARE

00:34:51.989 --> 00:34:52.657
AVAILABLE THROUGH THE COUNTY

00:34:52.723 --> 00:34:55.693
OFFICE- A THROUGH C. D. THROUGH

00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:58.429
CCTV TO ENSURE THAT THOSE-

00:34:58.496 --> 00:34:59.730
TARGETED. AREAS WHERE WE'RE

00:34:59.797 --> 00:35:00.932
SEEING THE MOST INTENSIVE

00:35:00.998 --> 00:35:02.433
INTERVENTION IS NEEDED THAT WE

00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:04.368
CAN PROVIDE THAT KIND OF DAY TO

00:35:04.435 --> 00:35:05.436
DAY SUPPORT IN PRACTICE OF

00:35:05.503 --> 00:35:10.107
ORGANISED. THE ACCELERATION OF

00:35:10.174 --> 00:35:10.675
IMPROVEMENT. THANK YOU VERY

00:35:10.741 --> 00:35:11.642
MUCH ANYBODY ELSE WISH TO. ON

00:35:11.709 --> 00:35:16.481

01:02:26.342 --> 01:02:28.544
ABOUT THE ABILITY OF US HAVING

01:02:28.611 --> 01:02:29.946
ENOUGH TEACHERS TO COME IN

01:02:30.012 --> 01:02:31.114
BEHIND THEM BECAUSE WHEN YOU

01:02:31.180 --> 01:02:32.915
LOOK AT ALL THESE INDIVIDUAL

01:02:32.982 --> 01:02:34.050
PROGRAMS THEY'RE GOOD AND WE

01:02:34.117 --> 01:02:34.984
HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE

01:02:35.051 --> 01:02:36.986
INDIVIDUAL PROGRAMS BUT I DON'T

01:02:37.053 --> 01:02:37.720
UNDERSTAND FULLY WHAT THE

01:02:37.787 --> 01:02:41.090
OVERALL. SITUATION IS OF

01:02:41.157 --> 01:02:42.525
WHETHER WE HAVE A SHORTAGE

01:02:42.592 --> 01:02:43.793
BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE RETIRING AT

01:02:43.860 --> 01:02:45.561
A MUCH FASTER RATE THAN NEW

01:02:45.628 --> 01:02:48.164
TEACHERS ARE COMING AND- I JUST

01:02:48.231 --> 01:02:49.632
DIDN'T GET A SENSE OF THAT FROM

01:02:49.699 --> 01:02:51.868
THE- OF THE INFORMATION I DON'T

01:02:51.934 --> 01:02:53.236
KNOW WHO WANTS TO TAKE THAT

01:02:53.302 --> 01:02:54.670
FIRST SHOULD I. START WITH

01:02:54.737 --> 01:02:58.274
DOCTOR SANDY AND THEN SEE ABOUT

01:02:58.341 --> 01:02:59.142
EITHER THE L. A. O. OR- FOR

01:02:59.208 --> 01:03:06.415
FINANCE. YES THANK YOU- THE

01:03:06.482 --> 01:03:07.016
ELITE SO THE COMMISSION DOES%

01:03:07.083 --> 01:03:10.520
NOT KEEP TRACK OF REQUIREMENTS

01:03:10.586 --> 01:03:14.590
PERCENT- WE HAVE DATA IN A IN A

01:03:14.657 --> 01:03:15.625
REPORT SOMEWHEREAND I

01:03:15.691 --> 01:03:17.093
CERTAINLY CAN GET THIS YEAR

01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:19.128
THAT INDICATES THE AGE RANGES-

01:03:19.195 --> 01:03:21.397
IN WHICH THE CURRENT POPULATION

01:03:21.464 --> 01:03:23.366
ALL OF WHICH COULD BE AN

01:03:23.432 --> 01:03:25.468
INDICATOR OF YOU KNOW WHEN TO

01:03:25.535 --> 01:03:26.402
BEGIN TO PREDICT REQUIREMENTS

01:03:26.469 --> 01:03:28.304
BUT I DON'T HAVE GOOD DATA AND

01:03:28.371 --> 01:03:30.206
MAYBE I SHOULD ASK EITHER.

01:03:30.273 --> 01:03:31.340
FINANCES THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:03:31.407 --> 01:03:33.109
EDUCATION FOR THE ELDERLY- IF

01:03:33.176 --> 01:03:34.877
ANY OF YOU FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE

01:03:34.944 --> 01:03:37.780
ENOUGH INFORMATION TO SPEAK TO

01:03:37.847 --> 01:03:44.987
THAT QUESTION. CHANNEL AIRED

01:03:45.054 --> 01:03:45.988
LIKE HONOR ON BEHALF OF THE

01:03:46.055 --> 01:03:47.190
STATE SUPERINTENDENT

01:03:47.256 --> 01:03:48.524
UNFORTUNATELY CD DOESN'T

01:03:48.591 --> 01:03:49.759
COLLECT THAT IF THAT

01:03:49.825 --> 01:03:50.893
INFORMATION BUT I BELIEVE THAT

01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:52.662
CAL SISTERS. MAY HAVE THAT

01:03:52.728 --> 01:03:54.463
INFORMATION SO EIGHT I THINK

01:03:54.530 --> 01:03:55.498
THAT WE HAVE TO GO TO A

01:03:55.565 --> 01:03:57.066
DIFFERENT AGENCY FOR THAT INFO

01:03:57.133 --> 01:03:58.000
OKAY BUT YOU SEE IT'S REALLY

01:03:58.067 --> 01:04:01.103
HARD. TO CONSIDER ALL THE

01:04:01.170 --> 01:04:02.905
TEACHER TRAINING PROGRAMS AND

01:04:02.972 --> 01:04:04.840
ASSESS THE RETIREMENTS THAT ARE

01:04:04.907 --> 01:04:06.409
POINTED OUT HERE THAT ARE

01:04:06.475 --> 01:04:08.010
DISPROPORTIONATELY HAPPENING

01:04:08.077 --> 01:04:10.446
DURING COLD FOOD. AGAINST WHAT

01:04:10.513 --> 01:04:12.448
THE NEED IS AND WHETHER WE'RE

01:04:12.515 --> 01:04:14.884
FALLING SHORT AND IT. AND WHILE

01:04:14.951 --> 01:04:16.919
I'M GOING TO LOOK AT THESE. ON

01:04:16.986 --> 01:04:18.154
THE FACE OF IT FOR WHAT THEY

01:04:18.221 --> 01:04:20.256
ARE WHICH IS WHICH IS OVERALL

01:04:20.323 --> 01:04:23.059
GOOD. IT WOULD BE NICE TO KNOW

01:04:23.125 --> 01:04:24.460
BEFORE MISSING A TARGET FOR

01:04:24.527 --> 01:04:25.628
WHAT WE REALLY NEED FOR

01:04:25.695 --> 01:04:26.996
TEACHERS AND WHETHER WE SHOULD

01:04:27.063 --> 01:04:28.598
BE AIMING SOME OF THESE EFFORTS

01:04:28.664 --> 01:04:30.566
NUMERICALLY TO THAT DOESN'T

01:04:30.633 --> 01:04:32.635
TELL US. WHETHER THESE NUMBERS

01:04:32.702 --> 01:04:36.372
ARE VALUABLE AGAINST WHAT THE

01:04:36.439 --> 01:04:38.808
OVERALL TRENDS ARE- AND LET ME.

01:04:38.874 --> 01:04:43.946
ASK AND I DON'T KNOW. WHETHER

01:04:44.013 --> 01:04:47.850
IT'S FINANCE OR THE COMMISSION

01:04:47.917 --> 01:04:49.652
WHEN THAT THE LEGISLATIVE

01:04:49.719 --> 01:04:52.722
ANALYST SAYS THAT OF THE

01:04:52.788 --> 01:04:54.523
CLASSIFIED PROGRAMS IN HIGH

01:04:54.590 --> 01:04:57.126
DEMAND BUT IS NOT TARGETED TO

01:04:57.193 --> 01:04:58.160
THE AREAS WHERE THERE ARE

01:04:58.227 --> 01:05:00.429
SHORTAGES DO EITHER OF YOU WANT

01:05:00.496 --> 01:05:05.434
TO SPEAK TO THAT. I CAN START

01:05:05.501 --> 01:05:06.035
AND SAY THAT THAT WASN'T IT

01:05:06.102 --> 01:05:08.471
WASN'T. THAT'S NEVER BEEN ONE

01:05:08.537 --> 01:05:10.539
OF THE PROVISIONS OF THE- OF

01:05:10.606 --> 01:05:14.777
THAT PROGRAM. THE TARGET SO.

01:05:14.844 --> 01:05:15.911
SELFISH ELIGIBILITY FOR THE

01:05:15.978 --> 01:05:17.380
GRASS BASED ON THE ELIGIBILITY

01:05:17.446 --> 01:05:18.648
DETERMINED BY THE LEGISLATURE

01:05:18.714 --> 01:05:20.716
WINNING THE PEACE FUNDS IN

01:05:20.783 --> 01:05:24.186
MOTION. THIRD I GUESSED THAT

01:05:24.253 --> 01:05:25.321
THE OUR WAY OF SAYING IT WOULD

01:05:25.388 --> 01:05:27.590
REALLY BE DESIRABLE TO TARGETED

01:05:27.657 --> 01:05:28.591
TO THE AREAS THAT ARE

01:05:28.658 --> 01:05:32.728
UNDERSERVED EVEN A. N. THE L.

01:05:32.795 --> 01:05:35.031
A. O. ARE YOU REALLY SUGGESTING

01:05:35.097 --> 01:05:36.365
THAT SINCE THIS ISN'T ON THE

01:05:36.432 --> 01:05:38.467
LEGISLATURE SHOULD ACTUALLY

01:05:38.534 --> 01:05:40.469
CONSIDER AS A POLICY MATTER.

01:05:40.536 --> 01:05:42.338
ADDING THAT AS A THING WHERE

01:05:42.405 --> 01:05:45.174
WHERE IT WOULD BE TARGETED TO

01:05:45.241 --> 01:05:46.976
THE UNDERSERVED AREAS. YES

01:05:47.043 --> 01:05:48.110
SENATOR THAT IS OUR

01:05:48.177 --> 01:05:49.979
RECOMMENDATION TO ADD YOUR

01:05:50.046 --> 01:05:51.213
LANGUAGE THAT WOULD PRIORITIZE

01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:52.214
DISTRICTS THAT ARE MOST

01:05:52.281 --> 01:05:54.417
AFFECTED BY SCHOOL DE SORRY

01:05:54.483 --> 01:05:58.554
TEACHER SHORTAGES. KERN IF

01:05:58.621 --> 01:06:00.222
THEY'RE GONNA GO BACK TO EITHER

01:06:00.289 --> 01:06:02.224
FINANCE OR FOR DOCTOR SANDY IF

01:06:02.291 --> 01:06:04.026
THE LEGISLATURE WERE TO DO

01:06:04.093 --> 01:06:08.164
THAT. DO YOU BELIEVE THAT WOULD

01:06:08.230 --> 01:06:11.267
BE HARDFOR YOU TO IMPLEMENT.

01:06:11.334 --> 01:06:13.469
WELL I DON'T IT'S NOT

01:06:13.536 --> 01:06:14.403
CHALLENGING TO IMPLEMENT THAT

01:06:14.470 --> 01:06:16.472
WE SIMPLY PUT THAT IN THE GRANT

01:06:16.539 --> 01:06:18.774
CONDITIONS FOR RATIFICATION AND

01:06:18.841 --> 01:06:20.109
THAT WILL LIMIT THE POOL OF WHO

01:06:20.176 --> 01:06:22.111
APPLIES. TO RECEIVE THESE

01:06:22.178 --> 01:06:24.547
GRANTS I DO WONDER HOWEVER

01:06:24.613 --> 01:06:26.282
WHETHER THIS IS THE RIGHT TIME

01:06:26.349 --> 01:06:29.752
TO DO THAT- IT'S NOT CLEAR TO

01:06:29.819 --> 01:06:31.921
ANY OF US YET WHAT RETIREMENTS

01:06:31.987 --> 01:06:33.322
ARE GOING TO BE LIKE THIS YEAR

01:06:33.389 --> 01:06:35.725
BASED ON CO. WE HEAR ABOUT IT

01:06:35.791 --> 01:06:36.992
IN THE WAY IN FACT WE DON'T I

01:06:37.059 --> 01:06:40.296
HAVEN'T WE DON'T WE WON'T KNOW

01:06:40.363 --> 01:06:43.065
OF. UNTIL FOR A FEW MONTHS YET.

01:06:43.132 --> 01:06:45.634
HOW MANY TEACHERS DECIDE THAT.

01:06:45.701 --> 01:06:47.069
THEY'RE GONNA RETIRED THIS YEAR

01:06:47.136 --> 01:06:48.104
BASED ON CODE BASED ON ANY

01:06:48.170 --> 01:06:49.472
NUMBER OF OTHER CONDITIONS SO

01:06:49.538 --> 01:06:51.307
IT'S CHALLENGING AT THE MOMENT

01:06:51.374 --> 01:06:53.309
TO KNOW WHERE THE AREAS OF NEED

01:06:53.376 --> 01:06:56.045
ARE GOING TO BE- IS AS WE MOVE

01:06:56.112 --> 01:06:59.081
FORWARD I THINK THOUGH THAT

01:06:59.148 --> 01:07:00.750
WHAT'S BEING POINTED OUT. IS

01:07:00.816 --> 01:07:03.519
THAT. IT IS NOT MEETING A

01:07:03.586 --> 01:07:05.521
DEMAND FOR THE SHORTAGES ARE

01:07:05.588 --> 01:07:06.856
AND I THINK THAT WHEN YOU DO

01:07:06.922 --> 01:07:08.991
THIS. YOU DON'T PRECLUDE THE

01:07:09.058 --> 01:07:10.393
OTHERS FROM APPLYING AND

01:07:10.459 --> 01:07:11.627
PRECLUDE THE OTHERS FROM BEING

01:07:11.694 --> 01:07:14.897
FUNDED IT IS. IT IS JUST THAT

01:07:14.964 --> 01:07:16.966
YOU TRY TO GO TO WHERE THE NEED

01:07:17.032 --> 01:07:19.034
IS AND THEN. IF THE

01:07:19.101 --> 01:07:20.836
APPLICATIONS ARE ONLY FROM

01:07:20.903 --> 01:07:21.537
AREAS THAT DON'T HAVE

01:07:21.604 --> 01:07:24.206
UNDERSERVED AND DID YOU. YOU

01:07:24.273 --> 01:07:25.508
SUCCESSFULLY RANKED THOSE

01:07:25.574 --> 01:07:26.942
APPLICATIONS AND MOVE IT OUT

01:07:27.009 --> 01:07:29.678
THE DOOR I DON'T THINK IT'S- IT

01:07:29.745 --> 01:07:31.680
WAS A SUGGESTION THAT IT BE.

01:07:31.747 --> 01:07:33.549
EXCLUDED THE OTHERS IT'S JUST

01:07:33.616 --> 01:07:36.252
IF THERE ARE. ARE HIGH NEEDS

01:07:36.318 --> 01:07:38.521
AND- IF IT TURNS OUT THAT THE

01:07:38.587 --> 01:07:40.656
DATA CHANGES YEAR TO YEAR THAT

01:07:40.723 --> 01:07:42.491
IS ACTUALLY RELATES TO MY

01:07:42.558 --> 01:07:43.692
PREVIOUS QUESTION WHICH IS IT

01:07:43.759 --> 01:07:45.761
WOULD BE REALLY GOOD TO HAVE A

01:07:45.828 --> 01:07:47.329
SENSE OF THE TRENDS BECAUSE

01:07:47.396 --> 01:07:49.231
WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW

01:07:49.298 --> 01:07:51.867
TO EFFECTIVELY. RESPOND TO THE

01:07:51.934 --> 01:07:54.136
TREND SENATE. EVERYBODY WAS

01:07:54.203 --> 01:07:55.738
POINTING TO ANOTHER AGENCY THAT

01:07:55.805 --> 01:07:57.873
IS NOT HERE BUT- BUT YOU'RE THE

01:07:57.940 --> 01:07:59.775
ONES ADDED MINISTERTHE TH THE

01:07:59.842 --> 01:08:02.311
PROGRAMS THAT. ARE SUPPOSED TO

01:08:02.378 --> 01:08:04.413
ADDRESS THE TRENDS SO IT WOULD

01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:07.116
BE REALLY GOOD TO KNOW. THAT IF

01:08:07.183 --> 01:08:08.384
THERE'S A SHORTAGE WE ARE

01:08:08.451 --> 01:08:10.152
REALLY ADDRESSING WHERE THE

01:08:10.219 --> 01:08:12.321
SHORTAGES. AND NOT JUST

01:08:12.388 --> 01:08:13.689
FIGURING MARC THIS IS GOOD AND

01:08:13.756 --> 01:08:14.890
WE'RE JUST GONNA DO THIS AND

01:08:14.957 --> 01:08:16.091
THERE'S BOUND TO BE A SHORTAGE

01:08:16.158 --> 01:08:17.493
SO WE NEED TO DO IT WOULD BE

01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:19.962
NICE TO HAVE SOME. SOME DATA

01:08:20.029 --> 01:08:25.935
THAT THAT SORT OF. COULD

01:08:26.001 --> 01:08:27.503
ADDRESS THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL

01:08:27.570 --> 01:08:29.538
SURE- AND WE COLLECT AND THAT

01:08:29.605 --> 01:08:30.506
THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION

01:08:30.573 --> 01:08:32.341
COLLECTS ANNUALLY IN THE FALL

01:08:32.408 --> 01:08:34.076
OF PROJECTED HIRES FOR THE

01:08:34.143 --> 01:08:35.678
FOLLOWING YEAR. AND WE DO

01:08:35.744 --> 01:08:37.947
REPORT THAT IN ORDER TO JUSTIFY

01:08:38.013 --> 01:08:41.217
REPORT EVERY YEAR- SO IT'S A

01:08:41.283 --> 01:08:43.552
PROJECTION. AND YOU KNOW AS OUR

01:08:43.619 --> 01:08:45.120
DATA SYSTEMS GET BETTER WILL BE

01:08:45.187 --> 01:08:46.288
ABLE TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE

01:08:46.355 --> 01:08:48.224
PROJECTION WAS ACCURATE OR NOT.

01:08:48.290 --> 01:08:50.826
BUT THE PROJECTIONS WE SEE FOR

01:08:50.893 --> 01:08:53.362
HIRING AROUND TWENTY THOUSAND

01:08:53.429 --> 01:08:54.697
WERE PROJECTED FOR THE NINETEEN

01:08:54.763 --> 01:08:58.134
TWENTY- ACADEMIC YEAR AS NEEDED

01:08:58.200 --> 01:08:59.902
TO BE HIRED. BY DISTRICTS

01:08:59.969 --> 01:09:01.971
REPORTED THIS ABOUT 30% OF

01:09:02.037 --> 01:09:03.506
THOSE REFER MULTIPLE SUBJECT

01:09:03.572 --> 01:09:04.840
TEACHERS WHO WORK PRIMARILY

01:09:04.907 --> 01:09:09.011
INDICATE ENVIRONMENT. OF ABOUT-

01:09:09.078 --> 01:09:12.348
10% 9% IN IN SCIENCE 9% IN

01:09:12.414 --> 01:09:14.817
ENGLISH A SINGLE SUBJECT AREAS.

01:09:14.884 --> 01:09:17.553
THAT 7% ACROSS THE SCIENCES-

01:09:17.620 --> 01:09:19.722
THAT'S MORE OR LESS HOW THE%

01:09:19.788 --> 01:09:21.657
BREAKDOWNS WERE FOR THE NUMBERS

01:09:21.724 --> 01:09:22.691
OF TEACHERS ACROSS DIFFERENT

01:09:22.758 --> 01:09:25.261
CREDENTIAL. TYPES IF THAT'S

01:09:25.327 --> 01:09:27.162
HELPFUL BUT I THINK THE STATE

01:09:27.229 --> 01:09:29.064
DOES NEED TO GET BETTER AND

01:09:29.131 --> 01:09:30.299
WE'D LIKE TO GET BETTER AT

01:09:30.366 --> 01:09:32.801
PROJECTING. A DEMAND. WELL WE

01:09:32.868 --> 01:09:34.069
CAN TELL YOU A LOT ABOUT WHO'S

01:09:34.136 --> 01:09:37.339
COMING INTO PREPARATION- AND

01:09:37.406 --> 01:09:38.641
PEOPLE COME IN AND OUT OF

01:09:38.707 --> 01:09:40.609
TEACHING OF FOR A WHOLE VARIETY

01:09:40.676 --> 01:09:41.977
OF REASONS THAT HAVEN'T BEEN

01:09:42.044 --> 01:09:43.512
PART OF THE SCOPE OF OUR STUDY.

01:09:43.579 --> 01:09:44.613
WE WOULD CERTAINLY LIKE TO BE

01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:45.714
ABLE TO SUPPORT THAT KIND OF

WILL THAT OUT OF WAY BUT- LAST

01:10:08.771 --> 01:10:11.807
YEAR. THE COMMISSION WAS ONLY

01:10:11.874 --> 01:10:13.309
TO ALLOCATE TWENTY SEVEN. OF

01:10:13.375 --> 01:10:15.377
THE- MONEY THAT HAD BEEN

01:10:15.444 --> 01:10:17.713
PROVIDED FOR THAT PROGRAM. AND

01:10:17.780 --> 01:10:19.915
THAT'S NOT DUE TO A LACK OF

01:10:19.982 --> 01:10:21.850
DEMAND FOR THE PROGRAM OR A

01:10:21.917 --> 01:10:24.920
LACK OF. EFFORT ON THE PART OF

THEY WERE ABOUT TO ALLOCATE

ADDITIONAL GRANTS AND SO THERE

01:10:36.031 --> 01:10:39.602
IS ALREADY WAITING APPLICATIONS

01:10:39.668 --> 01:10:41.070
TO BE BURNED. OUT FOR THE

01:10:41.136 --> 01:10:44.206
RESIDENCY PROGRAM SO I. I HAVE

01:10:44.273 --> 01:10:47.476
SOME CONCERN ABOUT. CUTTING THE

01:10:47.543 --> 01:10:50.512
PROPOSAL. TO BE LESS THAN A

01:10:50.579 --> 01:10:52.114
HUNDRED MILLION THAT IT WEEK

INCLUDED IN THAT GOVERNOR'S

01:10:53.315 --> 01:10:55.284
BUDGET SO IT JUST. BUT IT

01:10:55.351 --> 01:10:57.353
SHOULD BE THAT PROGRAM ON THAT

01:10:57.419 --> 01:11:03.792
NOTE. AND THEN LIVING ACTUALLY.

01:11:03.859 --> 01:11:05.728
CLASSIFIED PROGRAM. WE'RE OPEN

01:11:05.794 --> 01:11:07.196
TO. ABOUT ADJUSTING REQUIRE.

01:11:07.262 --> 01:11:10.633
FOR ELLIS IN THE PROGRAM- BUT I

01:11:10.699 --> 01:11:13.002
WOULD LIKE TO. KIND OF RAISED

01:11:13.068 --> 01:11:17.006
THE- IDEA TO THINK ABOUT IT WE

01:11:17.072 --> 01:11:19.208
BASED ELIGIBILITY ON LET'S SAY

01:11:19.274 --> 01:11:21.143
EXAMPLE EMERGENCYPERMITS OR

01:11:21.210 --> 01:11:22.277
WAIVERS YOU SHOULD KEEP IN

01:11:22.344 --> 01:11:25.914
MIND. THAT THOSE TYPES OF-

01:11:25.981 --> 01:11:28.150
LICENSORS FOR TEACHERS TO

01:11:28.217 --> 01:11:29.785
PROVIDE CLASSROOM INSTRUCTION

01:11:29.852 --> 01:11:31.887
ARE TEMPORARY THEY CAN ONLY BE

01:11:31.954 --> 01:11:33.088
ISSUED WARRANTS AND THEY'RE

01:11:33.155 --> 01:11:34.490
KIND OF LIKE THIS LOADING

01:11:34.556 --> 01:11:36.625
NUMBER SO A SCHOOL MAY HOW MANY

01:11:36.692 --> 01:11:38.794

01:11:38.861 --> 01:11:41.530
WORKED IN NEXT YEAR AND THAT'S

01:11:41.597 --> 01:11:44.933
SOMETHING TO KEEP IN MIND THAT-

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:46.735
DATE DATE COULD BE ELIGIBLE ONE

01:11:46.802 --> 01:11:48.404
YEAR AND THEN NOT ELIGIBLE FOR

01:11:48.470 --> 01:11:50.706
NEXT YEAR SO IT'S- LIKE I SAID

01:11:50.773 --> 01:11:52.574
WE'RE OPEN TO A CONVERSATION

01:11:52.641 --> 01:11:54.043
AROUND THAT BUT WE NEED TO

01:11:54.109 --> 01:11:55.077
DEFINITELY. WORK WITH THE

01:11:55.144 --> 01:11:56.845
COMMISSION ON THE DETAILS OF

01:11:56.912 --> 01:11:58.847
HOW THAT WOULD STRONG SHOWING

01:11:58.914 --> 01:12:02.117
WORK IN IMPLEMENTATION. THAT'S

01:12:02.184 --> 01:12:03.886

01:12:07.022 --> 01:12:08.924
ASK A CENTER MENIFEE HAS ANY

01:12:08.991 --> 01:12:11.093
QUESTIONS. YEAH I JUST WANTED

01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:12.494
TO REVISIT THAT RESIDENCY

01:12:12.561 --> 01:12:15.898
PROGRAM- ACCORDINGLY- REPORT

01:12:15.964 --> 01:12:18.667
THESE PROGRAMS HAVE HIGH COSTS

01:12:18.734 --> 01:12:20.736
ARE HIGH START UP COSTS. IT'S I

01:12:20.803 --> 01:12:21.770
GUESS MY QUESTION IS YOU KNOW

01:12:21.837 --> 01:12:23.706
WE ARE PROJECTING OUT IF I'M

01:12:23.772 --> 01:12:27.876
RECALLING. CORRECTLY I.

01:12:27.943 --> 01:12:28.744
SHORTFALLS IN THE BUDGET IN THE

01:12:28.811 --> 01:12:30.679
SUBSEQUENT YEARS OF THIS THIS-

01:12:30.746 --> 01:12:31.680

SURPLUS IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS.

01:12:35.951 --> 01:12:37.386
WILL BE ONES WERE FACING MORE

01:12:37.453 --> 01:12:39.621
CHALLENGES. GIVEN THAT THESE

01:12:39.688 --> 01:12:41.156
PROGRAMS COST SO MUCH TO SET UP

01:12:41.223 --> 01:12:42.891
DOES IT MAKE MORE SENSE TO

01:12:42.958 --> 01:12:45.194
ALLOCATE OUT. SOME OF THESE

01:12:45.260 --> 01:12:46.862
FUNDS OVER THREE FOUR YEARS

01:12:46.929 --> 01:12:49.031
PERHAPS OR- TO DO SOMETHING

01:12:49.098 --> 01:12:51.300
OTHER THAN COMMITTED AS ONE

01:12:51.366 --> 01:12:53.969
TIME. ONE YEAR FUNDING. YEP

01:12:54.036 --> 01:12:55.537
THIS IS KEN LAY HERE AGAIN WITH

01:12:55.604 --> 01:12:58.741

PERIOD SO IT'S ONE TIME FUNDING

01:13:07.449 --> 01:13:08.350
ONE HUNDRED MILLION BUT IT'S

01:13:08.417 --> 01:13:11.954
AVAILABLE OVER FIVE YEARS. SO

01:13:12.020 --> 01:13:12.821
THE THOUGHT WOULD BE THAT

01:13:12.888 --> 01:13:15.090
INITIALLY THE COMMISSION WOULD

01:13:15.157 --> 01:13:16.825

PERIOD AND THEN- THE SECOND

01:13:25.834 --> 01:13:28.670

01:13:28.737 --> 01:13:30.639

01:37:23.971 --> 01:37:25.539
EARLY JANUARY AT THE FEDERAL

01:37:25.606 --> 01:37:27.274

NINE BILLION TO CALIFORNIA I

01:37:33.113 --> 01:37:34.949

TO TITLE ONE SCHOOLS AND DIDN'T

01:37:36.617 --> 01:37:38.552
PASS THROUGH THE STATE. BUT

01:37:38.619 --> 01:37:40.354
THERE WAS SOME DISCRETIONARY

01:37:40.421 --> 01:37:42.356
MONEY IN THE HUNDREDS OF

01:37:42.423 --> 01:37:44.625
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND YOU'RE

01:37:44.692 --> 01:37:46.026
SAYING THAT YOU DON'T THINK

01:37:46.093 --> 01:37:48.028
ANYTHING WITHIN THAT IS A

01:37:48.095 --> 01:37:51.432
CANDIDATE TO COMPLEMENT THIS

01:37:51.498 --> 01:37:54.902
THESE PROGRAMS. ELEAZAR HOW THE-

01:37:54.969 --> 01:37:55.369

COMPLEMENT THE OTHER ROWING

01:37:58.072 --> 01:37:59.540
THOSE AS BUT I'M I'M SAYING

01:37:59.607 --> 01:38:01.542
THAT THERE'S A CERTAIN AMOUNT

01:38:01.609 --> 01:38:02.543
THAT COMES THROUGH THE STATE

01:38:02.610 --> 01:38:03.611

01:38:03.677 --> 01:38:06.146
APPROPRIATE AND- AND- I'M

01:38:06.213 --> 01:38:07.915
GATHERING FROM YOUR COMMENT.

THE L. A. L. L. E. AS THAT GOT.

01:38:13.621 --> 01:38:15.122
FEDERAL MONEY THAT SHOULD USE

01:38:15.189 --> 01:38:16.924
THAT TO COMPLIMENTED IT SHOULD

01:38:16.991 --> 01:38:20.628
NOT BE ANY OF THE DISCRETIONARY

01:38:20.694 --> 01:38:21.195
MONEY THAT CAME THROUGH THE

01:38:21.262 --> 01:38:23.998
STATE. I'M SORRY I DIDN'T CATCH

01:38:24.064 --> 01:38:26.767
THE END OF THE- THERE'S

01:38:26.834 --> 01:38:29.203
DISCRETIONARY MONEY THAT CAME

01:38:29.270 --> 01:38:31.438
THROUGH THE STATE AND YOU SAY

01:38:31.505 --> 01:38:33.474
THEY CAN USE FEDERAL MONEY TO

01:38:33.540 --> 01:38:36.677
DO IT AND NOT EVERY DISTRICT IS

01:38:36.744 --> 01:38:38.912
A TITLE ONE DISTRICT. AND WE

01:38:38.979 --> 01:38:40.781
HAVE DISCRETIONARY MONEY IN THE

01:38:40.848 --> 01:38:42.716
HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS

01:38:42.783 --> 01:38:45.419
AND I AM ASKING IF WHEN YOU SAY

01:38:45.486 --> 01:38:46.353
THEY SHOULD JUST USE FEDERAL

01:38:46.420 --> 01:38:48.989
MONEY. THAT YOU'RE NOT

01:38:49.056 --> 01:38:50.758

DISCRETIONARY MONEY THAT PASSES

01:38:52.793 --> 01:38:55.429
THROUGH- IS A VERY SMALL PIECE

01:38:55.496 --> 01:38:57.998
OF THAT WOULD BE USEFUL FOR

01:38:58.065 --> 01:39:02.036
THIS PURPOSE. I AM NOT PREPARED

01:39:02.102 --> 01:39:04.004

WOULD JUST SAY IT'S SOMETHING

01:39:14.114 --> 01:39:14.715
WE SHOULD CONSIDER HEADING

01:39:14.782 --> 01:39:17.351

01:39:17.418 --> 01:39:21.488
