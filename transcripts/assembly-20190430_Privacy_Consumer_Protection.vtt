00:24:19.291 --> 00:24:20.992
CATHERINE COOLEY --

TRADITIONALLY THE AMERICAN

00:24:21.626 --> 00:24:23.562
APPROACH TO PRIVACY HAS BEEN

00:24:23.628 --> 00:24:24.563
SECTOR BY SECTOR.

00:24:24.629 --> 00:24:25.797
WE'VE GONE INTO A SECTOR

00:24:25.864 --> 00:24:29.167
UNWRITTEN RULES FOR THE RULES OF

00:24:29.234 --> 00:24:30.769

A MORE GLOBAL APPROACH TO

00:24:39.544 --> 00:24:40.912
PRIVACY.

00:24:40.979 --> 00:24:43.448
THIS REPRESENTS A GREAT

00:24:43.515 --> 00:24:44.683
FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE IN HOW WE

00:24:44.749 --> 00:24:46.218

00:24:46.284 --> 00:24:48.687

00:24:53.959 --> 00:24:55.227
MY CONCERN.

00:24:55.293 --> 00:24:56.595
IS A WE HAVE A GREAT MANY

00:24:56.661 --> 00:24:58.363
PROGRAMS AT THE STATE LEVEL THE

00:24:58.430 --> 00:25:00.699
LOCAL LEVEL CITIES AND COUNTIES.

00:25:00.765 --> 00:25:03.134
OR UNITS A GOVERNOR TASKED WITH

00:25:03.201 --> 00:25:04.502
TRACKING DEAD BEAT DADS IN.

00:25:04.569 --> 00:25:06.304
AND WATCHING HOW MEDICAL CARE

00:25:06.371 --> 00:25:08.173
GETS DELIVERED AND MAINTAINING

00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:09.541
AFFORDABILITY HEALTHCARE SYSTEM.

00:25:09.608 --> 00:25:11.610
A WIDE ARRAY OF AREAS WHERE WE

00:25:11.676 --> 00:25:13.345
RUN GOVERNOR PROGRAMS WE SHOULD

00:25:13.411 --> 00:25:15.747
BE AFFECTED RELY UPON DATA AND

00:25:15.814 --> 00:25:17.148
THE ACCESS TO DATA.

00:25:17.215 --> 00:25:19.117
AND I HAVE A DEEP CONCERN THAT

00:25:19.184 --> 00:25:21.620
AS WE MAKE THE JUMP WHICH IS THE

00:25:21.686 --> 00:25:22.721
TRAINS LIKE TO STATION DO.

00:25:22.787 --> 00:25:24.055
THE MOVE THE MORE GLOBAL

00:25:24.122 --> 00:25:24.956
STANDARD.

00:25:25.023 --> 00:25:26.591
THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF LEGACY

00:25:26.658 --> 00:25:28.593
PROGRAMS ON THE BOOKS AND I AM

00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:31.529
CONCERNED FOR HOW WE HARMONIZE.

00:25:31.596 --> 00:25:32.330
THE ESTABLISHED PROGRAMS WITH

00:25:32.397 --> 00:25:34.332
THE NEW STANDARD.

00:25:34.399 --> 00:25:36.268
AND THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL.

00:25:36.334 --> 00:25:37.168
IS ABOUT FORCING NOW

00:25:37.235 --> 00:25:38.870
HARMONIZATION.

00:25:38.937 --> 00:25:40.705
I'VE I AM THANKFUL TO COMMITTEE

00:25:40.772 --> 00:25:42.741
SUBS OF AMENDMENTS I THINK THEY

00:25:42.807 --> 00:25:44.442
ARE COMPATIBLE THAT OBJECT.

00:25:44.509 --> 00:25:46.077
BUT HONESTLY THE ADDITION OF A

00:25:46.144 --> 00:25:48.313
SUNSET.

00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:49.080
IS TO MAKE CLEAR THAT EVEN AT

00:25:49.147 --> 00:25:50.515
THIS BILL SIGNED AND BY THE

00:25:50.582 --> 00:25:51.816
GOVERNOR AS I WOULD EXPECT IT

00:25:51.883 --> 00:25:53.752
WOULD BE.

00:25:53.818 --> 00:25:55.387
THAT ALL INTERESTED PARTIES DUE

00:25:55.453 --> 00:25:57.122
TO STAY ON THIS PROBLEM OF

00:25:57.188 --> 00:25:59.190
HARMONIZATION.

00:25:59.257 --> 00:26:01.660
SO WHY THEY IT ADEQUATELY

00:26:01.726 --> 00:26:02.460
HARMONIZED BY THE MEMBERS TODAY

00:26:02.527 --> 00:26:04.663
OR IF NOT WE HAVE FOUR YEARS TO

00:26:04.729 --> 00:26:06.131
WORK OUT THOSE DETAILS.

00:26:06.197 --> 00:26:07.966
BECAUSE FAILING THAT.

00:26:08.033 --> 00:26:09.334
THE SUNSET WILL OPERATE IT WOULD

00:26:09.401 --> 00:26:10.769
JUST GO BACK TO THE PRIVACY

00:26:10.835 --> 00:26:15.073
BILLS AND NOT ADOPTED LAST YEAR.

00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:16.408
SO IT'S SORT OF PUTTING EVERYONE

00:26:16.474 --> 00:26:19.277
ON THE GUN TO MAKE SURE THAT THE

00:26:19.344 --> 00:26:20.779
SYSTEMS ARE WORKING.

00:26:20.845 --> 00:26:22.681
AS WE HARMONIZE THE PRIOR WORK

00:26:22.747 --> 00:26:23.648
OF LEGISLATURE'S SPECIFIC DOUBLE

00:26:23.715 --> 00:26:25.684
PROGRAMS WITH THE NEW PRIVACY

00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:27.152
STANDARDS.

00:26:27.218 --> 00:26:30.021
SO THIS IS NOT A CASE EVEN HAVE.

00:26:30.088 --> 00:26:30.889
TAKEN THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS SO

00:26:30.956 --> 00:26:31.823
THEY WILL BE IN PLACE FOREVER.

00:26:31.890 --> 00:26:33.191
THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS WILL ONLY

00:26:33.258 --> 00:26:35.126
DEVIATE FROM LAST YEAR PRIVACY

00:26:35.193 --> 00:26:36.227
ACT.

00:26:36.294 --> 00:26:38.930
OF FORT BILLS FOR YEARS UNLESS

00:26:38.997 --> 00:26:40.699

00:26:40.765 --> 00:26:42.300
MODIFY THE RULES OR SOME WAY.

00:26:42.367 --> 00:26:43.802
AND I ACTUALLY SEE THAT AS WAY

00:26:43.868 --> 00:26:44.536
TO DRIVE IN NEED OF

00:26:44.602 --> 00:26:48.707
HARMONIZATION OF OUR STATUTES.

00:26:48.773 --> 00:26:49.541
SO WHAT THAT IS BACKDROP

WITH BLOOD RELATIVES.

00:28:08.486 --> 00:28:09.454
AND THAT'S COULD BE A

00:28:09.521 --> 00:28:11.289
CONTROVERSY TIME EXCUSE AFFECTED

OUR FOSTER CARE SYSTEM IN THIS

THE ANALYSIS POINTS OUT THE VERY

00:36:34.325 --> 00:36:34.825
QUESTION THAT THE COMMITTEE

SHOULD CONSIDER -- WHERE IT SAYS

00:36:36.627 --> 00:36:37.929
THE FUNDAMENTAL POLICY QUESTION

00:36:37.995 --> 00:36:39.130
AS TO WHETHER AND WHEN

AS YOU ALL KNOW.

00:36:46.938 --> 00:36:47.538

00:36:47.605 --> 00:36:48.472
RIGHT TO PRIVACY IS ENSHRINED IN

00:36:48.539 --> 00:36:49.840
ARTICLE ONE SECTION ONE OF THE

00:36:49.907 --> 00:36:51.142
CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION.

00:36:51.208 --> 00:36:52.710
WE BELIEVE THAT THE PROVISIONS

00:36:52.777 --> 00:36:54.445
IN THE C. C. PA THAT PROVIDE A

00:36:54.512 --> 00:36:56.447

00:36:56.514 --> 00:36:57.782
OF THE SALE OF THEIR DATA.

00:36:57.848 --> 00:36:59.817
OR REQUESTS FOR DATA A BUSINESS

00:36:59.884 --> 00:37:01.252
TO DELETE THEIR DATA ARE

00:37:01.319 --> 00:37:03.287
MECHANISMS FOR A CONSUMER TO

00:37:03.354 --> 00:37:04.555
REALIZE THAT CONSTITUTIONAL

00:37:04.622 --> 00:37:05.790
RIGHT AND PRACTICES NOT BECAUSE

00:37:05.856 --> 00:37:07.625
THERE WANT TO PARTICIPATE IN

00:37:07.692 --> 00:37:08.960
FRAUDULENT ACTIVITY.

00:37:09.026 --> 00:37:11.596
OR DO SOMETHING INAPPROPRIATE BE

00:37:11.662 --> 00:37:12.163
BECAUSE BECAUSE I WANT TO

00:37:12.229 --> 00:37:14.465
REALIZE THEIR RIGHT TO PRIVACY

00:37:14.532 --> 00:37:16.033
TO DATE.

00:37:16.100 --> 00:37:16.601
IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT

00:37:16.667 --> 00:37:17.835
GOVERNMENT.

00:37:17.902 --> 00:37:19.570
AGENCIES AND OTHERS HAVE BECOME

00:37:19.637 --> 00:37:21.072
TO RUN HAVE COME TO RELY ON

00:37:21.138 --> 00:37:23.774
LARGE DATABASES WHERE FOLKS PUT

00:37:23.841 --> 00:37:25.943

PROGRAM IF A CONSUMERS EXERCISE

00:37:31.782 --> 00:37:32.950
THE RIGHT TO OPT OUT.

00:37:33.017 --> 00:37:33.951

GOVERNMENT AGENCY STILL BE ABLE

00:37:36.454 --> 00:37:38.356
TO COLLECT DATA ON THAT CONSUMER

00:37:38.422 --> 00:37:38.990
FOR POTENTIALLY NEEDING IT IN

00:37:39.056 --> 00:37:40.124
THE FUTURE.

00:37:40.191 --> 00:37:42.026
I THINK WE HAVE A SERIOUS WE

00:37:42.093 --> 00:37:43.127
THINK THAT PRESENTS A SERIOUS

00:37:43.194 --> 00:37:44.528
POLICY QUESTION THAT SHOULD BE

CONSIDERED HERE.

00:37:46.297 --> 00:37:47.331
JUST BECAUSE IT CAN IF CONSUMERS

THE RETAIL PURCHASES.

00:37:53.537 --> 00:37:54.572
SHOULD THAT DAY TO STILL BE ABLE

00:37:54.639 --> 00:37:56.340
TO BE SOLD TO GOVERNMENT FOR A

00:37:56.407 --> 00:37:58.909
PURPOSE OF POTENTIALLY FINDING.

00:37:58.976 --> 00:38:01.278
A RELATIVE FOR ANOTHER MECHANISM

00:38:01.345 --> 00:38:02.513
I KNOW SOME OF THE THINGS THAT

00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:04.749
WERE MENTIONED HERE INCLUDED

00:38:04.815 --> 00:38:06.784

DEVELOPED OR IN PLACE TO PROTECT

00:38:15.626 --> 00:38:16.661
THAT TYPE OF BEHAVIOR BUT THERE

00:38:16.727 --> 00:38:17.995
ARE MECHANISMS THROUGH THE

00:38:18.062 --> 00:38:20.031

00:38:22.133 --> 00:38:23.534
AND THERE'S MECHANISMS.

00:38:23.601 --> 00:38:25.469

NEEDS TO BE SOLVED BUT I I DO

00:41:57.181 --> 00:41:58.282

I DO NOT BELIEVE THIS IS A BILL

00:42:31.482 --> 00:42:32.650
THAT TAKES THE BOTTOM OUT OF THE

00:42:32.716 --> 00:42:34.485

00:42:34.551 --> 00:42:36.020
SOMETHING UNIQUE IS HAPPENING IN

00:43:34.678 --> 00:43:36.113
IT FORCES IT BACK INTO THE HOLES

00:43:36.180 --> 00:43:37.481

00:55:58.188 --> 00:55:59.656
ALLOW US TO MANIPULATE IT SO

00:55:59.723 --> 00:56:00.790

01:10:54.683 --> 01:10:56.585
ECONOMY IS BROADLY SHARED --

01:10:56.652 --> 01:10:59.722
MISTER MEMBERS WE WERE PERSUADED

01:10:59.788 --> 01:11:01.590
TO SUPPORT THE BILL BASED ON THE

01:11:01.657 --> 01:11:03.425
AMENDMENTS AT THAT ARE REFLECTED

01:11:03.492 --> 01:11:04.727
IN THE ANALYSIS AND WE HOPE THAT

01:11:04.793 --> 01:11:06.729
YOU WILL AS WELL. FOR THREE

01:11:06.795 --> 01:11:08.731
REASONS THE FIRST IS HOPEFULLY

01:11:08.797 --> 01:11:10.199
WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT PERHAPS

01:11:10.265 --> 01:11:12.368
OTHER THAN PUTTING A CAMERA IN

01:11:12.434 --> 01:11:14.036
YOUR HOME THE ABILITY OF

01:11:14.103 --> 01:11:15.871
TECHNOLOGY TO EAVESDROP ON YOUR

01:11:15.938 --> 01:11:16.639
MOST INTIMATE AND PERSONAL

01:11:16.705 --> 01:11:18.874
CONVERSATIONS IN THE HOME.

01:11:18.941 --> 01:11:20.376
BETWEEN YOUR WIFE BETWEEN YOUR

01:11:20.442 --> 01:11:21.610
HUSBAND DEALING WITH YOUR

01:11:21.677 --> 01:11:24.113
CHILDREN IS PERHAPS THE MOST

01:11:24.179 --> 01:11:28.684
SERIOUS PRIVACY INVASIVE RISK

01:11:28.751 --> 01:11:29.818
IMAGINABLE.

01:11:29.885 --> 01:11:31.186
WE BELIEVE THAT TO SIMPLY BE

01:11:31.253 --> 01:11:32.087
TRUE.

01:11:32.154 --> 01:11:34.690
THE SECOND IS THAT THE CCPA.

01:11:34.757 --> 01:11:36.492
DOES NOT REALLY GRAPPLE WITH THE

01:11:36.558 --> 01:11:38.193
KIND OF PERSONAL INFORMATION

01:11:38.260 --> 01:11:40.229
REVEALED IN A RECORDED

01:11:40.295 --> 01:11:42.765
CONVERSATION IN SEVENTEEN NINETY

01:11:42.831 --> 01:11:44.299
EIGHT POINT -- ONE FOR THE

01:11:44.366 --> 01:11:45.634
DEFINITIONS OF PERSONAL.

01:11:45.701 --> 01:11:46.935
INFORMATION DEAL WITH THINGS

01:11:47.002 --> 01:11:48.804
LIKE IDENTIFIERS LIKE SOCIAL

01:11:48.871 --> 01:11:49.638
SECURITY NUMBER AND THOSE SORTS

01:11:49.705 --> 01:11:51.640
OF THINGS OR INTERNET BROWSING

01:11:51.707 --> 01:11:52.675
HISTORY.

01:11:52.741 --> 01:11:54.810
IT'S MORE REALLY ABOUT WHO YOU

01:11:54.877 --> 01:11:55.944
ARE.

01:11:56.011 --> 01:11:57.780
AND WHAT YOU MIGHT DO.

01:11:57.846 --> 01:12:00.049
BUT NOT VERY CLEARLY IF AT ALL

01:12:00.115 --> 01:12:03.085
ABOUT WHAT YOU SAY.

01:12:03.152 --> 01:12:04.720
AND THE FACT THAT THE CCPA DID

01:12:04.787 --> 01:12:06.155
NOT REPEAL.

01:12:06.221 --> 01:12:07.556
THE TELEVISION EAVESDROPPING

01:12:07.623 --> 01:12:10.092
STATUTE THAT THE AMENDMENTS

01:12:10.159 --> 01:12:12.861
AMEND IN THE ANALYSIS.

01:12:12.928 --> 01:12:15.164
IS AT LEAST INFERENTIAL LEE.

01:12:15.230 --> 01:12:16.365
OF THE FACT THAT THERE IS A

01:12:16.432 --> 01:12:19.168
SPECIAL NEED HERE FOR PRIVACY

01:12:19.234 --> 01:12:20.202
AND THAT THE CZ P. A. DOES

01:12:20.269 --> 01:12:21.570
SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

01:12:21.637 --> 01:12:23.172
THAN WHAT IS PROPOSED BY THIS

01:12:23.238 --> 01:12:25.207
BILL PROPORTIONAL TO THE

01:12:25.274 --> 01:12:26.442
POTENTIAL PRIVACY INVASION.

01:12:26.508 --> 01:12:28.243
AND THE THIRD AND FINALLY I

01:12:28.310 --> 01:12:28.777
THINK THIS IS ONE OF THE

01:12:28.844 --> 01:12:29.912
INSTANCES.

01:12:29.978 --> 01:12:31.146
WHERE THE LANGUAGE OF THE BILL

01:12:31.213 --> 01:12:32.247
AS IT IS PROPOSED TO BE AMENDED

01:12:32.314 --> 01:12:35.584
ITSELF MAKES THE BEST CASE FOR

01:12:35.651 --> 01:12:37.419
VOTING FOR THE BILL ON PAGE

01:12:37.486 --> 01:12:38.454
SEVEN OF YOUR ANALYSIS THE

01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:39.888
AMENDMENTS -- THE PROPOSED

01:12:39.955 --> 01:12:40.923
AMENDMENTS BEGINNING YOU WILL

01:12:40.989 --> 01:12:41.657
SEE.

01:12:41.724 --> 01:12:43.392
THAT ALL WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:12:43.459 --> 01:12:44.193
HERE WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:12:44.259 --> 01:12:45.994
THE POSSIBILITY OF RECORDED

01:12:46.061 --> 01:12:48.897
CONVERSATIONS BETWEEN YOU AND

01:12:48.964 --> 01:12:50.165
YOUR FAMILY IN YOUR HOME.

01:12:50.232 --> 01:12:51.767
IS REALLY TWO THINGS.

01:12:51.834 --> 01:12:53.802
THE FIRST IS THAT THE WARNING

01:12:53.869 --> 01:12:55.771
ABOUT THAT HAPPENS NOT AT SOME

01:12:55.838 --> 01:12:57.740
OTHER OCT IN PLACE BUT DURING

01:12:57.806 --> 01:13:00.242
THE INSTALLATION OF THE PRODUCT

01:13:00.309 --> 01:13:01.643
THAT'S THERE IN SUBDIVISION A

01:13:01.710 --> 01:13:03.445
THAT SEEMS PROPORTIONAL TO THE

01:13:03.512 --> 01:13:04.446
SERIOUSNESS.

01:13:04.513 --> 01:13:05.881
OF THE IDEA OF A RECORDED

01:13:05.948 --> 01:13:07.649
CONVERSATION IN YOUR HOME WHICH

01:13:07.716 --> 01:13:09.251
IS WHY WE DID IT FOR TELEVISIONS

01:13:09.318 --> 01:13:10.719
AND WHICH IS WHY DIDN'T DO WORD

01:13:10.786 --> 01:13:13.555
EVEN AFTER THE CCPA WAS AN ACTOR.

01:13:13.622 --> 01:13:14.123
THE SECOND IS THE ASSEMBLY

01:13:14.189 --> 01:13:16.291
MEMBER SAID OR TALKING ABOUT

01:13:16.358 --> 01:13:18.660
CONSUMER CONSENTED IT IS WRITTEN

01:13:18.727 --> 01:13:20.229
AGAIN IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE

01:13:20.295 --> 01:13:21.930
RECORDING CONVERSATIONS THAT

01:13:21.997 --> 01:13:23.532
TAKE PLACE IN THE HOME.

01:13:23.599 --> 01:13:25.300
SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE

01:13:25.367 --> 01:13:26.268
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR DR.

01:13:26.335 --> 01:13:29.004
THANK YOU VERY MUCH ADDITIONAL

01:13:29.071 --> 01:13:29.538
SUPPORTERS -- PLEASE COME

01:13:29.605 --> 01:13:31.140
FORWARD.

01:13:31.206 --> 01:13:32.875
SEEN AN OPPOSITION PLEASE COME

01:13:32.941 --> 01:13:41.683
FORWARD.

01:13:41.750 --> 01:13:43.318
WELCOME THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR

01:13:43.385 --> 01:13:44.620
ACCORDING JENSEN ALTEC MATT AND

01:13:44.686 --> 01:13:47.156
I IN OPPOSITION -- WE APPRECIATE

01:13:47.222 --> 01:13:49.324
THE DIRECTION OF THE BILL AND

01:13:49.391 --> 01:13:50.893
AND THE AMENDMENTS I'M IN THE

01:13:50.959 --> 01:13:53.996
ANALYSIS -- WE DID SEE THE

01:13:54.062 --> 01:13:55.964
AMENDMENTS ON FRIDAY SO ARE

01:13:56.031 --> 01:13:58.634
STILL DIGESTING -- AND STILL

01:13:58.700 --> 01:14:00.135
SORT OF LOOKING THROUGH THAT THE

01:14:00.202 --> 01:14:01.303
NEW DIRECTION THAT THIS BILL'S

01:14:01.370 --> 01:14:03.539
GOING AND SORT OF JUST ONE TO

01:14:03.605 --> 01:14:05.040
ADD COME UP HERE AND AND KIND OF

01:14:05.107 --> 01:14:06.642
TALK ABOUT HOW THESE DEVICES

01:14:06.708 --> 01:14:07.843
WORK AND WHAT THEY DON'T DO.

01:14:07.910 --> 01:14:11.146
AND DEVICES ARE NOT LISTENING IN --

01:14:11.213 --> 01:14:12.748
AFTER THE FACT COMPANIES MAY

01:14:12.815 --> 01:14:14.683
REVIEW A SMALL NUMBER OF DE

01:14:14.750 --> 01:14:17.052
IDENTIFIED UTTERANCES RECORDED

01:14:17.119 --> 01:14:19.087
FROM A RANDOM SET OF CUSTOMERS

01:14:19.154 --> 01:14:21.423
IN ORDER TO AUDIT AND IMPROVE

01:14:21.490 --> 01:14:23.058
MACHINE LEARNING TOOLS.

01:14:23.125 --> 01:14:24.526
SO FOR EXAMPLE THIS INFORMATION

01:14:24.593 --> 01:14:26.728
HELPS TRAIN SPEECH RECOGNITION

01:14:26.795 --> 01:14:29.164
AND NATURAL LANGUAGE SYSTEMS SO

01:14:29.231 --> 01:14:30.999
A DEVICE CAN BETTER BETTER

01:14:31.066 --> 01:14:33.435
UNDERSTAND YOUR REQUEST ENSURE

01:14:33.502 --> 01:14:35.938
THE SERVICE WORKS FOR EVERYONE --

01:14:36.004 --> 01:14:38.941
BY DESIGN VOICE DEVICES DETECT A

01:14:39.007 --> 01:14:40.776
SPECIFIC WORD TO WAKE UP LIKE A

01:14:40.843 --> 01:14:43.111
VERBAL ON BUTTON AND THE DEVICE

01:14:43.178 --> 01:14:45.113
DETECTS THE WAKE WORD OF THE HOT

01:14:45.180 --> 01:14:46.715
WORD AND WHATEVER IT'S CALLED BY

01:14:46.782 --> 01:14:49.384
IDENTIFYING ACOUSTIC PATTERNS.

01:14:49.451 --> 01:14:51.854
THAT MATCH THAT WORD NO AUDIO IS

01:14:51.920 --> 01:14:53.822
STORED OR SENT TO THE CLOUD

01:14:53.889 --> 01:14:56.391
UNLESS THE DEVICE FIRST DETECTS

01:14:56.458 --> 01:14:58.961
THE WAKE WORD OR IN SOME A

01:14:59.027 --> 01:15:00.495
BUTTON IS ACTUALLY PUSHED.

01:15:00.562 --> 01:15:03.398
AND IN RARE CASES A VOICE DEVICE

01:15:03.465 --> 01:15:05.467
WILL WAKE UP DUE TO A WORD AND

01:15:05.534 --> 01:15:06.835
BACKGROUND CONVERSATION AND

01:15:06.902 --> 01:15:08.837
COMPANIES CONTINUE TO IMPROVE

01:15:08.904 --> 01:15:11.306
WAKE WORD ACCURACY AND MINIMIZE

01:15:11.373 --> 01:15:13.575
FALSE RESPONSES IN PART BY

01:15:13.642 --> 01:15:15.344
REVEALING RECORDINGS.

01:15:15.410 --> 01:15:16.712
I ALSO WANT TO STATE THAT

01:15:16.778 --> 01:15:18.380
MANUFACTURERS OF THESE DEVICES

01:15:18.447 --> 01:15:20.415
ALREADY GIVE CONSUMERS CONTROL

01:15:20.482 --> 01:15:22.384
OVER THEIR RECORDINGS CONSUMERS

01:15:22.451 --> 01:15:24.586
CAN ALREADY ACCESS MANAGE AND

01:15:24.653 --> 01:15:27.055
DELETE RECORDINGS ASSOCIATED

01:15:27.122 --> 01:15:28.624
WITH THE CONSENT CONSUMERS

01:15:28.690 --> 01:15:29.291
ACCOUNT.

01:15:29.358 --> 01:15:31.226
SO IF FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU HAVE

01:15:31.293 --> 01:15:32.027
ONE OF THESE DEVICES IN YOUR

01:15:32.094 --> 01:15:33.495
HOME YOU CAN ACTUALLY GO ON TO

01:15:33.562 --> 01:15:35.664
YOUR ACCOUNT SEE WHAT WAS

01:15:35.731 --> 01:15:36.565
RECORDED.

01:15:36.632 --> 01:15:41.136
AT REVIEW IT AND DELETE IT IF

01:15:41.203 --> 01:15:42.170
YOU WOULD LIKE TO AND SO YOU

01:15:42.237 --> 01:15:43.405
ALREADY HAVE THAT OPTION AS A

01:15:43.472 --> 01:15:44.006
CONSUMER.

01:15:44.072 --> 01:15:46.041
AND TO THE CCPA POINT CCPA WAS

01:15:46.108 --> 01:15:47.209
WRITTEN TO ENCOMPASS ALL

01:15:47.276 --> 01:15:50.078
TECHNOLOGIES -- AND YOU KNOW WE

01:15:50.145 --> 01:15:53.048
WE UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS --

01:15:53.115 --> 01:15:54.883
YOU KNOW TECHNOLOGY THAT IS --

01:15:54.950 --> 01:15:56.351
GROWING AND PEOPLE ARE LEARNING

01:15:56.418 --> 01:15:58.353
MORE ABOUT -- BUT WE THINK THAT

01:15:58.420 --> 01:16:00.355
TECHNOLOGY SPECIFIC BILL I'M

01:16:00.422 --> 01:16:01.390
WHEN WE'RE STILL DEALING WITH

01:16:01.456 --> 01:16:02.457
THE C. C. PAY AND THE

01:16:02.524 --> 01:16:04.526
IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT I'M MAY

01:16:04.593 --> 01:16:07.229
NOT BE NECESSARY -- AND

01:16:07.296 --> 01:16:10.365
ESPECIALLY WITH THE A BREATH OF

01:16:10.432 --> 01:16:11.566
THE CCPA IN THE PERSONAL

01:16:11.633 --> 01:16:13.635
INFORMATION DEFINITION IN CCPA

01:16:13.702 --> 01:16:16.071
WHICH IS WHICH DOES COVER --

01:16:16.138 --> 01:16:18.473
RECORDINGS AUDIO VISUAL I'M

01:16:18.540 --> 01:16:20.208
PURCHASE HISTORY MANY OTHER

01:16:20.275 --> 01:16:23.011
THINGS -- IN THE C. C. P. AS YOU

01:16:23.078 --> 01:16:23.679
ALL ARE VERY WELL AWARE AT THIS

01:16:23.745 --> 01:16:26.949
POINT AND SO WE DO BELIEVE THAT

01:16:27.015 --> 01:16:29.451
ENTERING AND HAVING A NEW BILL

01:16:29.518 --> 01:16:30.819
THAT IS NOT.

01:16:30.886 --> 01:16:32.554
INTRODUCING A CONSUMER OPT IN

01:16:32.621 --> 01:16:33.855
WHEN WE ALREADY HAVE A CONSUMER

01:16:33.922 --> 01:16:35.891
OPT OUT COULD BRING ON A LEVEL

01:16:35.958 --> 01:16:37.225
OF CONFUSION TO THIS MARKET

01:16:37.292 --> 01:16:39.628
PLACE -- AGAIN WE ARE CONTINUING

01:16:39.695 --> 01:16:41.563
TO ROUTE REVIEW THE LANGUAGE BUT

01:16:41.630 --> 01:16:42.898
SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WE HAVE

01:16:42.965 --> 01:16:44.733
IDENTIFIED THERE'S NO DEFINITION

01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:46.568
OF THIRD PARTY -- WRITTEN

01:16:46.635 --> 01:16:48.537
CONSENT -- YOU KNOW THAT COULD

01:16:48.603 --> 01:16:50.739
BE A WITH A WHOLE HOST OF THINGS

01:16:50.806 --> 01:16:52.507
IF WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT --

01:16:52.574 --> 01:16:54.810
AUTHORIZATION AND THAT MAYBE

01:16:54.876 --> 01:16:56.545
SOMETHING BY A WRITTEN CONSENT --

01:16:56.611 --> 01:16:58.180
COULD BE VERY BROAD AND THERE'S

01:16:58.246 --> 01:16:59.548
NO DEFINITION OF HOW THAT THAT

01:16:59.614 --> 01:17:02.384
WOULD -- TAKE PLACE IN A LOT --

01:17:02.451 --> 01:17:04.619
SHARING -- THERE'S NO DEFINITION

01:17:04.686 --> 01:17:06.455
OF SHARING OR SOLD -- DURING

01:17:06.521 --> 01:17:08.056
INSTALLATION WHAT DOES THAT

01:17:08.123 --> 01:17:09.825
NECESSARILY MEAN -- SO GIVEN THE

01:17:09.891 --> 01:17:10.692
FACT THAT WE'VE SEEN THIS BILL

01:17:10.759 --> 01:17:12.527
ON FRIDAY THE LANGUAGE ON FRIDAY

01:17:12.594 --> 01:17:13.895
WORD WERE WORKING THROUGH A

01:17:13.962 --> 01:17:15.630
WHOLE HOST OF ISSUES THAT WE CAN

01:17:15.697 --> 01:17:16.999
SEND YOU TO SEE AND THIS

01:17:17.065 --> 01:17:18.033
LANGUAGE.

01:17:18.100 --> 01:17:19.901
AND AND SO WE ARE IN AN OPPOSE

01:17:19.968 --> 01:17:22.270
POSITION AND BASED ON THAT --

01:17:22.337 --> 01:17:24.239
EVEN THOUGH WE APPRECIATE THE

01:17:24.306 --> 01:17:25.674

TERRIBLE WITH CAL CHAMBER -- WE

01:17:30.679 --> 01:17:32.247
ASSOCIATE OUR COMMENTS FOR THOSE

01:17:32.314 --> 01:17:39.021

PERSONALLY TO POSITION OF

01:18:18.660 --> 01:18:19.461
SUPPORT BUT I HAVE SOME SERIOUS

01:18:19.528 --> 01:18:20.862
CONCERNS THAT I JUST WANT TO

01:18:20.929 --> 01:18:22.164
HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT.

01:18:22.230 --> 01:18:23.065
FIRST WILL JUST TO MAKE SURE

01:18:23.131 --> 01:18:24.633
THAT I'M UNDERSTANDING CORRECTLY

01:18:24.699 --> 01:18:26.001
BECAUSE THE ANALYSIS ISN'T VERY

01:18:26.068 --> 01:18:27.069
CLEAR.

01:18:27.135 --> 01:18:29.171
THE YOU'VE MOVE WHERE THIS BILL

01:18:29.237 --> 01:18:30.372
THE SECTION OF CODE THAT THIS

01:18:30.439 --> 01:18:32.107
BILL IS LOCATED IN RIGHT IN THE

01:18:32.174 --> 01:18:33.442
IN THE AMENDMENTS SO.

01:18:33.508 --> 01:18:35.110
IS IT OF THE AMENDMENTS THAT

01:18:35.177 --> 01:18:36.344
YOU'RE TAKING COMPLETELY DID

01:18:36.411 --> 01:18:38.647
DELETE THE ENTIRE BILL IT'S IN

01:18:38.713 --> 01:18:39.848
PRINT AND REPLACE IT WITH THE

01:18:39.915 --> 01:18:40.782
AMENDMENTS IN THE ANALYSIS IS

01:18:40.849 --> 01:18:42.150
THAT RIGHT THAT'S CORRECT AND

01:18:42.217 --> 01:18:44.319
THE THE REASON FOR THAT AND

01:18:44.386 --> 01:18:45.654
WORKING WITH COMMITTEE STAFF WAS

01:18:45.720 --> 01:18:47.456
THAT WE ORIGINALLY HAD THE

01:18:47.522 --> 01:18:50.559
CONCEPT OF THIS -- IN AND WE'RE

01:18:50.625 --> 01:18:51.960
GONNA AND THEN THE CIVIL CODE

01:18:52.027 --> 01:18:55.063
AND SINCE THE THERE'S A BASELINE

01:18:55.130 --> 01:18:56.298
ALREADY AND A STATUE IN THE

01:18:56.364 --> 01:18:57.532
BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS CODE

01:18:57.599 --> 01:18:59.568
THAT APPLIES. TO SMART

01:18:59.634 --> 01:19:01.403
TELEVISIONS SO IT MADE A LOT

01:19:01.470 --> 01:19:03.572
MORE SENSE TO PUT THIS LANGUAGE

01:19:03.638 --> 01:19:04.039
INTO THE BUSINESS AND

01:19:04.106 --> 01:19:06.141
PROFESSIONS CODE AND EXTENDED TO

01:19:06.208 --> 01:19:09.077
OTHER TYPES OF ENABLED DEVICES.

01:19:09.144 --> 01:19:09.711
I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH YOU I

01:19:09.778 --> 01:19:11.780
THINK IT MAKES A LOT MORE SENSE

01:19:11.847 --> 01:19:12.914
THE WAY THAT YOU'VE DONE IT IN

01:19:12.981 --> 01:19:19.221
THE AMENDMENTS YOU CAN THANK

01:19:19.287 --> 01:19:22.357
COMMITTEE BECAUSE IT WAS THIRD.

01:19:22.424 --> 01:19:23.258
FOR AWHILE MANY LET'S TAKE IT

01:19:23.325 --> 01:19:24.025
OFF AND WHAT WELL I'M IF I'M

01:19:24.092 --> 01:19:24.759
TAKING COMMITTEE LET ME JUST SAY

01:19:24.826 --> 01:19:25.494
THAT IT WOULD BE MUCH MORE

01:19:25.560 --> 01:19:26.528
HELPFUL BEFORE FOR THOSE OF US

01:19:26.595 --> 01:19:26.995
THAT LIKE TO DO THINGS

01:19:27.062 --> 01:19:27.662
ELECTRONICALLY WHEN YOU SAY

01:19:27.729 --> 01:19:28.597
STRIKE OUTLINES BLANK THROUGH

01:19:28.663 --> 01:19:28.830
BLANK.

01:19:28.897 --> 01:19:29.731
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THAT MEANS

01:19:29.798 --> 01:19:31.266
THERE'S NO LINE NUMBERS ON THE

01:19:31.333 --> 01:19:34.102
ELECTRON AREA SO WE'LL MAKE THAT

01:19:34.169 --> 01:19:34.936
TOP.

01:19:35.003 --> 01:19:35.737
OUR UPLAND LET'S TALK ABOUT THE

01:19:35.804 --> 01:19:36.304
THE MY MAJOR PROBLEM THAT'S

01:19:36.371 --> 01:19:37.739
REMAINING WITH THE BILL WHICH IS

01:19:37.806 --> 01:19:38.140
THE WORD STORED.

01:19:38.206 --> 01:19:41.643
SO THE WAY THAT YOU'VE GOT THE

01:19:41.710 --> 01:19:43.145
BILL WORDED RIGHT NOW -- ACTUAL

01:19:43.211 --> 01:19:44.112
AUDIO RECORDINGS OF SPOKEN WORDS

01:19:44.179 --> 01:19:45.413
COLLECTED THROUGH THE DEVICES

01:19:45.480 --> 01:19:47.082
CANNOT BE STORED AND LESS THE

01:19:47.149 --> 01:19:48.650
CONSUMER PROVIDES A WRITTEN

01:19:48.717 --> 01:19:49.518
CONSENT.

01:19:49.584 --> 01:19:51.253
AND I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT

01:19:51.319 --> 01:19:54.289
BECAUSE AS A SOMEONE THAT HAS.

01:19:54.356 --> 01:19:56.024
WRITTEN CODE FOR THESE KINDS OF

01:19:56.091 --> 01:19:57.626
SYSTEMS BEFORE I CAN TELL YOU

01:19:57.692 --> 01:19:58.693
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO GET THE

01:19:58.760 --> 01:20:01.029
DEVICE TO TO OPERATE WITHOUT

01:20:01.096 --> 01:20:02.697
STORING IT SO I MEAN.

01:20:02.764 --> 01:20:04.699
IN LAYMAN'S TERMS YOUR AMAZON

01:20:04.766 --> 01:20:06.701
SPEAKER IS IS GOT A MICROPHONE

01:20:06.768 --> 01:20:08.537
AND WHEN YOUR ARE TALKING.

01:20:08.603 --> 01:20:11.339
IT'S IT'S DIGITIZING YOU KNOW

01:20:11.406 --> 01:20:12.941
THE THE THE MICRA THE INPUT FROM

01:20:13.008 --> 01:20:14.075
THE MICROPHONE AND STORING THAT

01:20:14.142 --> 01:20:15.143
IN COMPUTER MEMORY AND THEN IT'S

01:20:15.210 --> 01:20:16.478
LOOKING AND TRYING TO PARSE THAT

01:20:16.545 --> 01:20:18.713
INTO WORDS MATCHING UP AGAINST

01:20:18.780 --> 01:20:19.381
YOUR VOICE.

01:20:19.447 --> 01:20:21.650
RIGHT -- IT CAN'T GET PAST THAT

01:20:21.716 --> 01:20:23.084
FIRST STEP.

01:20:23.151 --> 01:20:24.486
WITHOUT STORING IT IN MEMORY

01:20:24.553 --> 01:20:25.687
IT'S GOT TO BE STORED THERE

01:20:25.754 --> 01:20:27.088
FIRST AND SO.

01:20:27.155 --> 01:20:28.323
I'M NOT SURE THAT YOU MEANT IT

01:20:28.390 --> 01:20:29.791
TO BE THAT BROAD.

01:20:29.858 --> 01:20:31.793
BUT IF YOU MEANT IT TO BE MORE

01:20:31.860 --> 01:20:33.028
NARROW LIKE.

01:20:33.094 --> 01:20:34.729
IT CAN'T BE TRANSMITTED BACK UP

01:20:34.796 --> 01:20:36.698
TO THE MOTHER SHIP.

01:20:36.765 --> 01:20:39.434
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT THAT IN

01:20:39.501 --> 01:20:40.468
THAT ANY IDEA IS SO BECAUSE

01:20:40.535 --> 01:20:42.871
STILL WHEN YOU SAY STORED IN A

01:20:42.938 --> 01:20:44.005
TECHNICAL SENSE THE MOMENT.

01:20:44.072 --> 01:20:45.874
YOU READ THAT MICROPHONE INTO

01:20:45.941 --> 01:20:47.142
COMPUTER MEMORY IT'S BEEN STORED.

01:20:47.209 --> 01:20:48.677
IT'S AYE AYE STE I SEE YOUR

01:20:48.743 --> 01:20:50.345
POINT THAT'S A THAT'S A GREAT

01:20:50.412 --> 01:20:53.048
POINT YEAH THAT -- WHAT WE'RE

01:20:53.114 --> 01:20:54.349
SEEKING TO PREVENT IS THE

01:20:54.416 --> 01:20:56.551
RETENTION OF PERSONAL

01:20:56.618 --> 01:20:58.653
CONVERSATIONS ARE RECORDED?

01:20:58.720 --> 01:20:59.888
I ASSUME IT'S GOING IN THE CLOUD

01:20:59.955 --> 01:21:00.956
WORSE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT

01:21:01.022 --> 01:21:02.457
IT'S TRANSMITTED BACK TO THE

01:21:02.524 --> 01:21:03.225
MOTHER SHIP.

01:21:03.291 --> 01:21:04.359
SO IF WE NEED TO TIGHTEN THE

01:21:04.426 --> 01:21:06.494
LANGUAGE TO ACCOMPLISH CYCLE

01:21:06.561 --> 01:21:07.128
THAT I THINK WE SHOULD TAKE THE

01:21:07.195 --> 01:21:08.563
LANGUAGE.

01:21:08.630 --> 01:21:11.333
I MEAN THERE'S BECAUSE THERE'S

01:21:11.399 --> 01:21:14.102
NO TEMPORAL ASPECT TO STORED AS

01:21:14.169 --> 01:21:14.469
WE'VE WRITTEN.

01:21:14.536 --> 01:21:16.304
THIS IS IF I UNDERSTAND THE

01:21:16.371 --> 01:21:18.106
CONCERN CREDIT RIGHT SO GOES IN

01:21:18.173 --> 01:21:20.275
THE RAM OR SOMETHING RIGHT

01:21:20.342 --> 01:21:22.177
COMPUTER MEMORY OF YOUR STORY SO

01:21:22.244 --> 01:21:22.577
THEY WOULD HAVE.

01:21:22.644 --> 01:21:23.945
THIS SITE WHICH POTENTIALLY

01:21:24.012 --> 01:21:26.147
COULD RENDER THE DEVICE IS NON

01:21:26.214 --> 01:21:28.016
FUNCTIONAL.

01:21:28.083 --> 01:21:29.651
RIGHT YES YEAH THAT'S A PROBLEM

01:21:29.718 --> 01:21:30.051
SO.

01:21:30.118 --> 01:21:31.353
WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON

01:21:31.419 --> 01:21:33.054
RICH REFINING INFORMATION WHAT

01:21:33.121 --> 01:21:35.257
WE'RE SEEKING. TO TO PREVENT IS

01:21:35.323 --> 01:21:37.792
THE ON CONSENTED.

01:21:37.859 --> 01:21:39.628
TO RECORDING AND RETENTION OF

01:21:39.694 --> 01:21:40.195
PRIVATE CONVERSATIONS IN THE

01:21:40.262 --> 01:21:41.963
HOME.

01:21:42.030 --> 01:21:46.368
SO SO -- OKAY SO LET ME IT'S

01:21:46.434 --> 01:21:47.202
TRICKY STUFF THESE ARE YOU KNOW

01:21:47.269 --> 01:21:48.370
YEAH SO LET ME TALK ABOUT A MORE

01:21:48.436 --> 01:21:49.938
NUANCED.

01:21:50.005 --> 01:21:51.573
CONCERNED WITH THE WORD STORED

01:21:51.640 --> 01:21:52.841
SO.

01:21:52.907 --> 01:21:55.610
THE OTHER WAY THESE DEVICES WORK

01:21:55.677 --> 01:21:56.244
THAT THEY'RE VERY SOPHISTICATED

01:21:56.311 --> 01:21:59.047
AND THEY'RE TRAINED OVER TIME

01:21:59.114 --> 01:22:01.383
[inaudible] TO RECOGNIZE THE

01:22:01.449 --> 01:22:04.019
NUANCES OF USERS VOICE SO IF I'M.

01:22:04.085 --> 01:22:05.754
SAYING IF I SAY TOMATO INSTEAD

01:22:05.820 --> 01:22:07.756
OF TOMATO.

01:22:07.822 --> 01:22:08.590
OVER TIME IT'S GOING TO PICK

01:22:08.657 --> 01:22:09.658
THAT UP.

01:22:09.724 --> 01:22:11.660
IF I SAY POTATO INSTEAD OF

01:22:11.726 --> 01:22:12.961
TOMATO IT CAN LOOK IN THE

01:22:13.028 --> 01:22:14.229
CONTEXT OF WHAT I'VE SAID THE

01:22:14.296 --> 01:22:16.264
SENTENCE AND REALIZE WHAT I

01:22:16.331 --> 01:22:17.632
MEANT EVEN THOUGH THAT MIGHT

01:22:17.699 --> 01:22:20.335
MAYBE WAS ALL GARBLED ARTS LEARN

01:22:20.402 --> 01:22:20.902
A LITTLE BIT WHEN I SAID IT.

01:22:20.969 --> 01:22:22.504
SO.

01:22:22.570 --> 01:22:23.838
YOU KNOW THAT HAS GOT TO PERSIST

01:22:23.905 --> 01:22:24.506
AND MAYBE THAT'S NOT DATA THAT

01:22:24.572 --> 01:22:27.075
COULD SET UP TO THE MOTHER SHIP.

01:22:27.142 --> 01:22:28.777
BUT CERTAINLY WITHIN THE DEVICE

01:22:28.843 --> 01:22:30.078
THAT'S THINGS THAT THAT'S THAT'S

01:22:30.145 --> 01:22:32.013
INFORMATION IS USEFUL FOR THE

01:22:32.080 --> 01:22:34.883
CONSUMER TO HAVE THEIR SO.

01:22:34.949 --> 01:22:36.284
YOU KNOW I I THINK THAT THE THE

01:22:36.351 --> 01:22:37.786
CONCEPT OF WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO

01:22:37.852 --> 01:22:38.887
DO IS YOU DON'T WANT.

01:22:38.953 --> 01:22:41.056
THIS RECORDED CONVERSATION BEING

01:22:41.122 --> 01:22:42.223
SET UP TO A SERVER SOMEWHERE

01:22:42.290 --> 01:22:42.824
THAT.

01:22:42.891 --> 01:22:44.192
THAT SOMEONE AT THE COMPANY CAN

01:22:44.259 --> 01:22:46.461
ACCESS AND YOU DON'T WANT

01:22:46.528 --> 01:22:47.729
SOMEONE TO BE ABLE.

01:22:47.796 --> 01:22:49.731
TO CONNECT TO THE DEVICE AND GET

01:22:49.798 --> 01:22:51.433
ACCESS TO THAT INFORMATION BUT I

01:22:51.499 --> 01:22:52.801
THINK IT'S OKAY IF THE DEVICE

01:22:52.867 --> 01:22:54.469
CAN USE THAT INFORMATION IN ITS

01:22:54.536 --> 01:22:55.170
OPERATION.

01:22:55.236 --> 01:22:57.038
SO IF YOU'RE GOING TO USE THE

01:22:57.105 --> 01:22:58.940
WORD STORED IN THERE I THINK

01:22:59.007 --> 01:23:00.442
IT'S GOING TO REQUIRE.

01:23:00.508 --> 01:23:02.844
A LOT OF TECHNICAL FOCUS ON

01:23:02.911 --> 01:23:05.280
EXACTLY WHAT YOU MEAN BY STORED.

01:23:05.347 --> 01:23:06.781
WELL I I'D WELCOME A COUPLE

01:23:06.848 --> 01:23:08.383
THINGS AND THEN I'D LIKE MY

01:23:08.450 --> 01:23:09.551
WITNESS I THINK HE HAS SOMETHING

01:23:09.617 --> 01:23:12.087
TO SAID TO ADDRESS THAT AS WELL

01:23:12.153 --> 01:23:13.755
AND HE'S PROBABLY MORE TECHNICAL.

01:23:13.822 --> 01:23:18.159
TECHNICALLY SAVVY THAN I I GUESS

01:23:18.226 --> 01:23:24.199
NOT BUT HAVING A YEAH I I WOULD

01:23:24.265 --> 01:23:26.468
ADD TO THIS THIS THOUGHT THOUGH.

01:23:26.534 --> 01:23:27.902
IF PEOPLE WANT THAT ENHANCE

01:23:27.969 --> 01:23:29.537
EXPERIENCE WHERE THERE'S A

01:23:29.604 --> 01:23:31.272
MACHINE LEARNING ELEMENT AND IT

01:23:31.339 --> 01:23:32.674
CAME OUT IN THE MEDIA COUPLE

01:23:32.741 --> 01:23:34.209
WEEKS AGO AMAZON'S GOT A

01:23:34.275 --> 01:23:35.076
THOUSAND POLICE INTO FOUR

01:23:35.143 --> 01:23:37.078
DIFFERENT COUNTRIES ARE ACTUALLY

01:23:37.145 --> 01:23:38.413
GOING THROUGH CONVERSATIONS MAY.

01:23:38.480 --> 01:23:39.314
YOU KNOW MANUALLY AND

01:23:39.381 --> 01:23:42.150
TRANSCRIBING THINGS AND SENDING

01:23:42.217 --> 01:23:43.918
THAT DATA BACK TO THE COMPANY.

01:23:43.985 --> 01:23:46.221
AND I PRESUME AND THEY'RE DOING

01:23:46.287 --> 01:23:47.389
THAT.

01:23:47.455 --> 01:23:48.656
TO INCREASE THE USER EXPERIENCE

01:23:48.723 --> 01:23:50.225
SO THAT THEY CAN LEARN TO MADE

01:23:50.291 --> 01:23:51.993
OVERSEAS TOMATO AND SO FORTH

01:23:52.060 --> 01:23:53.862
MAYBE DIALECTS ACCENTS WHAT HAVE

01:23:53.928 --> 01:23:54.662
YOU.

01:23:54.729 --> 01:23:56.698
I DO THINK THE CONSUMER SHOULD

01:23:56.765 --> 01:23:58.366
BE GIVEN A CHOICE THOUGH IF THAT

01:23:58.433 --> 01:24:00.668
COMES AT A COST OF THEIR PRIVATE

01:24:00.735 --> 01:24:02.003
CONVERSATIONS IN THE HOME BEING.

01:24:02.070 --> 01:24:03.438
A RECORDED AND RETAINED BY A

01:24:03.505 --> 01:24:05.106
COMPANY I THINK THE CONSUMER

01:24:05.173 --> 01:24:06.107
SHOULD HAVE.

01:24:06.174 --> 01:24:08.243
LIKE YOU COULD SAY AND IT SHE'S

01:24:08.309 --> 01:24:09.911
GOT A GOOD POINT I THINK ON

01:24:09.978 --> 01:24:11.379
WHICH IS VERY ARTICULATE.

01:24:11.446 --> 01:24:12.847
AND MAKES A GOOD POINT ON THE

01:24:12.914 --> 01:24:14.115
THE THAT WE PROBABLY NEED TO

01:24:14.182 --> 01:24:16.484
REFINE HOW THE WRITTEN CONSENT

01:24:16.551 --> 01:24:18.319
WOULD WORK -- WE DO THIS WITH

01:24:18.386 --> 01:24:19.654
WARRANTY CARDS AND THINGS OF

01:24:19.721 --> 01:24:20.755
THAT SORT HE COULD SENSE

01:24:20.822 --> 01:24:21.923
SOMETHING AND YOU COULD HAVE AN

01:24:21.990 --> 01:24:24.225
EMAIL HEY WOULD YOU LIKE THE

01:24:24.292 --> 01:24:25.860
ENHANCED EXPERIENCE.

01:24:25.927 --> 01:24:27.562
IF SO YOU KNOW.

01:24:27.629 --> 01:24:29.063
DO YOU CONSENT TO US --

01:24:29.130 --> 01:24:30.064
RECORDINGS.

01:24:30.131 --> 01:24:31.966
YOUR VERBAL COMMANDS AND YOU

01:24:32.033 --> 01:24:33.067
PUTTING THEM THROUGH A MACHINE

01:24:33.134 --> 01:24:34.702
LEARNING PROCESS OR SOMETHING TO

01:24:34.769 --> 01:24:36.137
IMPROVE YOUR PRODUCTS OF A YOU

01:24:36.204 --> 01:24:38.106
KNOW YOU MAKE SURE YOU GET ROCK

01:24:38.173 --> 01:24:38.940
MUSIC CANNOT COUNTRY OR WHATEVER

01:24:39.007 --> 01:24:39.374
IT IS.

01:24:39.441 --> 01:24:41.109
AND THEN PEOPLE CAN SEND AN

01:24:41.176 --> 01:24:42.911
EMAIL IN THERE AND YOU KNOW THAT

01:24:42.977 --> 01:24:43.878
I WOULD SUBMIT THAT PROBABLY

01:24:43.945 --> 01:24:45.113
SOLVE A PROBLEM THAT WOULD PUT

01:24:45.180 --> 01:24:46.381
THE CONSUMER BACK IN THE

01:24:46.448 --> 01:24:47.248
DRIVER'S SEAT OF THAT.

01:24:47.315 --> 01:24:49.083
OF THAT DECISION RIGHT NOW THE

01:24:49.150 --> 01:24:50.652
DECISIONS BE MADE FOR THEM

01:24:50.718 --> 01:24:51.920
WITHOUT THEIR KNOWLEDGE WHEN

01:24:51.986 --> 01:24:53.354
THEY BUY THE DEVICE SO THIS IS

01:24:53.421 --> 01:24:54.722
REALLY GETTING TO THE CRUX OF

01:24:54.789 --> 01:24:55.857
OUR DISAGREEMENT BECAUSE I DON'T

01:24:55.924 --> 01:24:56.224
HAVE.

01:24:56.291 --> 01:24:58.460
A PROBLEM WITH MY SMART SPEAKER

01:24:58.526 --> 01:25:00.662
RECORDING AND DOING ALL OF THIS

01:25:00.728 --> 01:25:03.431
ANALYTICS ON MY MY VOICE AS LONG

01:25:03.498 --> 01:25:07.669
AS IT NEVER GOES ANYWHERE ELSE.

01:25:07.735 --> 01:25:08.236
I ANY OTHER PEOPLE DOES GO

01:25:08.303 --> 01:25:09.437
SOMEWHERE ELSE THOUGH I THINK IT

01:25:09.504 --> 01:25:10.939
GOES TO THE CLOUD UNDER THAT ON

01:25:11.005 --> 01:25:13.274
THAT'S HOW THEY ARE ABLE TO GET

01:25:13.341 --> 01:25:13.942
IT IN THE HANDS OF THE INTERNAL

01:25:14.008 --> 01:25:15.143
IS NUANCED CASES THAT WE'RE

01:25:15.210 --> 01:25:16.110
TALKING ABOUT.

01:25:16.177 --> 01:25:17.579
YOU KNOW WHERE IT'S JUST USED IN

01:25:17.645 --> 01:25:19.447
ITS RETAIN STORED IF YOU WILL

01:25:19.514 --> 01:25:20.482
BUT IT'S USED.

01:25:20.548 --> 01:25:22.050
YOU KNOW INTERNALLY IN THE

01:25:22.116 --> 01:25:23.351
DEVICE TO IMPROVE THE USER

01:25:23.418 --> 01:25:25.653
EXPERIENCE IN THE FUTURE I DON'T

01:25:25.720 --> 01:25:26.354
HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT.

01:25:26.421 --> 01:25:28.990
SOURCE SAYING THAT YOU DO HAVE A

01:25:29.057 --> 01:25:29.591
PROBLEM WITH THAT YOU NEED YOU

01:25:29.657 --> 01:25:29.991
YOU THINK THAT.

01:25:30.058 --> 01:25:35.063
A USER SHOULD HAVE TO PROVIDE

01:25:35.129 --> 01:25:36.197
WRITTEN CONSENT.

01:25:36.264 --> 01:25:37.365
YEAH I I I DO HAVE A PROBLEM

01:25:37.432 --> 01:25:37.632
WITH IT.

01:25:37.699 --> 01:25:39.334
I I THINK THAT THE MAJORITY OF

01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:40.702
OUR CONSTITUENTS WOULD HAVE A

01:25:40.768 --> 01:25:42.303
PROBLEM WITH IT AND I THINK THAT

01:25:42.370 --> 01:25:45.640
AN OPT IN MAKES SENSE BECAUSE

01:25:45.707 --> 01:25:47.442
YOU HAVE TO HAVE SAFEGUARDS FOR

01:25:47.509 --> 01:25:48.877
PRIVACY COMMENSURATE WITH THE

01:25:48.943 --> 01:25:50.478
THREAT TO PRIVACY IN THE THREAT

01:25:50.545 --> 01:25:51.813
TO PRIVACY OF A DEVICE THAT.

01:25:51.880 --> 01:25:53.915
IN YOUR HOME IN YOUR BEDROOMS IN

01:25:53.982 --> 01:25:55.783
YOUR KITCHENS.

01:25:55.850 --> 01:25:57.485
INTERCONNECTED AND BEAMING

01:25:57.552 --> 01:25:58.953
THINGS BACK BUT YOU'RE SAYING TO

01:25:59.020 --> 01:26:00.855
YOUR KIDS AND YOUR SPOUSE OR

01:26:00.922 --> 01:26:03.992
PARTNER -- CONSTANTLY AT THAT'S

01:26:04.058 --> 01:26:05.927
THAT'S A PRETTY BIG THREAT I

01:26:05.994 --> 01:26:08.129
MEAN THERE'S THERE'S NO WAY

01:26:08.196 --> 01:26:11.132
AROUND THAT I THINK AND SO I I'M.

01:26:11.199 --> 01:26:13.268
I'M SAYING I THINK IT SHOULD BE

01:26:13.334 --> 01:26:14.936
AN OPT IN SYSTEM.

01:26:15.003 --> 01:26:16.871
BEFORE A COMPANY CAN RECORD YOUR

01:26:16.938 --> 01:26:18.873
PRIVATE CONVERSATIONS.

01:26:18.940 --> 01:26:22.176
AND IN I'M NOT TRYING.

01:26:22.243 --> 01:26:25.480
TO PROHIBIT THE THE USE OF

01:26:25.547 --> 01:26:29.050
MACHINE LEARNING OR THE USE OF

01:26:29.117 --> 01:26:31.052
THESE CONVERSATIONS IN A IN A

01:26:31.119 --> 01:26:32.754
MANNER THAT.

01:26:32.820 --> 01:26:35.423
MAKES THE PRODUCT BETTER -- BUT

01:26:35.490 --> 01:26:36.424
YOU KNOW WHAT'S WRONG WITH

01:26:36.491 --> 01:26:37.959
SAYING LOOK YOU YOU GOT TWO

01:26:38.026 --> 01:26:39.260
OPTIONS WE CAN MAKE THE SMART

01:26:39.327 --> 01:26:40.628
SPEAKER THE GREATEST THING

01:26:40.695 --> 01:26:42.497
THAT'S EVER EXISTED IT CAN --

01:26:42.564 --> 01:26:43.798
YOU KNOW.

01:26:43.865 --> 01:26:44.866
IN TEN YEARS WILL BE READING OUR

01:26:44.933 --> 01:26:46.267
MINDS OF PUTTING COUNTRY MUSIC

01:26:46.334 --> 01:26:48.469
ON FOR YOU GET UP I DON'T KNOW.

01:26:48.536 --> 01:26:53.041
AS A SO.

01:26:53.107 --> 01:26:54.709
BUT YOU KNOW IF PEOPLE WANT TO

01:26:54.776 --> 01:26:55.076
HAVE.

01:26:55.143 --> 01:26:56.811
CONFIDENCE THAT THE DEVICE IS

01:26:56.878 --> 01:26:57.645
NOT.

01:26:57.712 --> 01:26:59.080
EFFECTIVELY POTENTIALLY SPYING

01:26:59.147 --> 01:27:03.318
ON THEM -- PASSIVELY ALBEIT BUT

01:27:03.384 --> 01:27:04.686
IN A RECORDING THINGS THAT THEY

01:27:04.752 --> 01:27:05.787
HAVE NOT GIVEN IT PERMISSION TO

01:27:05.853 --> 01:27:06.588
RECORD.

01:27:06.654 --> 01:27:08.590
THEY CAN OPT FOR I GUESS THE

01:27:08.656 --> 01:27:09.724
LOWER TECH VERSION.

01:27:09.791 --> 01:27:11.159
SO YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GOOD IF YOU

01:27:11.225 --> 01:27:12.827
IF IF I GIVE A VERBAL COMMAND

01:27:12.894 --> 01:27:14.996

SO IT'S IT SOUNDS LIKE.

01:27:26.908 --> 01:27:27.642

STILL.

01:27:50.164 --> 01:27:51.532
ALLOWING THE DEVICE TO FUNCTION

01:27:51.599 --> 01:27:55.169
IN A WAY THAT BENEFITS CONSUMERS.

01:27:55.236 --> 01:27:56.337
THANK YOU ALL RIGHT.

WANT TO THANK YOU FOR IN THIS

01:28:00.541 --> 01:28:01.809
BILL I DON'T HAVE ONE OF THESE

01:28:01.876 --> 01:28:04.345
DEVICES BECAUSE I AGREE WITH YOU

01:28:04.412 --> 01:28:06.080
HOME IS THERE A SACRED PLACE I

01:28:06.147 --> 01:28:07.215
WAS AT A FRIEND'S HOUSE AND HE

01:28:07.281 --> 01:28:09.217
PULLED UP HIS -- FEET ON HIS

01:28:09.283 --> 01:28:11.452
AMAZON DEVICE SHOWING ME HOW

01:28:11.519 --> 01:28:15.256
MANY BITS OF HIS CONVERSATION IT

01:28:15.323 --> 01:28:16.557
HAD RECORDED ON I WAS.

01:28:16.624 --> 01:28:17.225
SHOCKED AND I AGREE WITH YOU THE

01:28:17.291 --> 01:28:17.692
BOTH THE JUDICIAL AND

01:28:17.759 --> 01:28:19.260
LEGISLATIVE BRANCHES OF OVER

01:28:19.327 --> 01:28:19.927
TIMES OF THEWHAT HAPPENS IN THE

01:28:19.994 --> 01:28:20.428
SANCTITY OF THE HOME IS

01:28:20.495 --> 01:28:22.063
ABSOLUTELY ONE OF THE MOST

01:28:22.130 --> 01:28:23.431
PRIVATE SPHERES AND IT IS

01:28:23.498 --> 01:28:24.732
INCUMBENT UPON US TO PROTECT IT.

01:28:24.799 --> 01:28:26.501
BUT IN ALL OF THAT I ACTUALLY

01:28:26.567 --> 01:28:28.136
DON'T HEAR MUCH OF DISPUTE

01:28:28.202 --> 01:28:29.937
BETWEEN YOU AND THE OPPOSITION.

01:28:30.004 --> 01:28:31.139
I THINK THAT FIRST ON THE

01:28:31.205 --> 01:28:32.874
DEFINITIONS I'VE ALREADY HEARD

01:28:32.940 --> 01:28:34.042
MISTER CUNNINGHAM SAY THAT HE'S

01:28:34.108 --> 01:28:36.077
ABSOLUTELY HAPPY TO FIND CONSENT

01:28:36.144 --> 01:28:38.279
SO THAT THAT'S A WORKABLE.

01:28:38.346 --> 01:28:41.516
TERM DIED SOMEWHERE RIGHT -- AND

01:28:41.582 --> 01:28:43.217
ALSO ON THE COMPUTER LEARNING

01:28:43.284 --> 01:28:45.086
PIECE I MEAN EVERY.

01:28:45.153 --> 01:28:47.121
WE HEAR BILLS EVER HEARING THE

01:28:47.188 --> 01:28:48.289
DEAL WITH THE IDENTIFIED DATA

01:28:48.356 --> 01:28:50.858
AND ALLOW FOR THAT KIND OF WORK

01:28:50.925 --> 01:28:52.560
WHERE IT IS WE JUST DID A BILL

01:28:52.627 --> 01:28:53.695
WHERE WAS AGGREGATE IN DE

01:28:53.761 --> 01:28:55.096
IDENTIFIED AND WOULD ENABLE THE

01:28:55.163 --> 01:28:56.330
TYPE OF COMPUTER LEARNING THAT

01:28:56.397 --> 01:28:57.365
YOU'RE LOOKING.

01:28:57.432 --> 01:28:59.133
FOR WITHOUT STORING THE TYPE OF

01:28:59.200 --> 01:29:00.601
CONVERSATIONS THAT MR CUNNINGHAM

01:29:00.668 --> 01:29:02.203
IS CONCERNED ABOUT AND SO I

01:29:02.270 --> 01:29:04.372
THINK THAT IN YOUR CONCERN ABOUT

01:29:04.439 --> 01:29:05.573
THE ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO MAKE

01:29:05.640 --> 01:29:06.708
THESE DEVICES SMARTER THERE IS A

01:29:06.774 --> 01:29:08.309
WAY TO PROTECT THE PRIVACY OF

01:29:08.376 --> 01:29:09.844
THESE CONVERSATIONS.

01:29:09.911 --> 01:29:11.179
AND SO I WOULD URGE BOTH OF YOU

01:29:11.245 --> 01:29:12.246
TO WORK TOGETHER ON A SOLUTION

01:29:12.313 --> 01:29:13.548
THAT IS WORKABLE BECAUSE I THINK

01:29:13.614 --> 01:29:14.716
THAT AT THE END OF THE DAY WE

01:29:14.782 --> 01:29:16.050
NEED TO PROTECT.

01:29:16.117 --> 01:29:16.818
THE PRIVACY OF THESE

01:29:16.884 --> 01:29:18.219
CONVERSATIONS I DON'T HEAR

01:29:18.286 --> 01:29:23.324
ANYTHING IN THE OPPOSITION THAT

01:29:23.391 --> 01:29:23.891
WOULD MAKE THAT AND WORKABLE

01:29:23.958 --> 01:29:24.192
[inaudible]

01:29:24.258 --> 01:29:25.226
THANK YOU.

01:29:28.196 --> 01:29:29.063
FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD

01:29:29.130 --> 01:29:30.498
AND I'M ALSO A CO AUTHOR SO I

01:29:30.565 --> 01:29:31.432
YOU KNOW.

01:29:31.499 --> 01:29:32.567
VERY STRONGLY BELIEVE IN WHAT

01:29:32.633 --> 01:29:33.634
HE'S TRYING TO DO HERE AND I I

01:29:33.701 --> 01:29:34.836
THINK THAT YOU KNOW THERE ARE

01:29:34.902 --> 01:29:35.870
OBVIOUSLY SOME THINGS THAT WE

01:29:35.937 --> 01:29:37.305
CAN THAT WE CAN WORK THROUGH

01:29:37.371 --> 01:29:38.406
HERE AND THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT

01:29:38.473 --> 01:29:40.041
OF THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS BY

01:29:40.108 --> 01:29:41.976
THE WAY IS TO CONTINUALLY TAKE

01:29:42.043 --> 01:29:42.210
INPUT.

01:29:42.276 --> 01:29:44.545
MAKE SURE THIS IS GOOD POLICY AT

01:29:44.612 --> 01:29:46.314
THE END OF THE DAY IT'S WORKABLE --

01:29:46.380 --> 01:29:48.082
BUT TWO VERY IMPORTANT THINGS

01:29:48.149 --> 01:29:49.450
THAT I THAT I THINK MAYBE A

01:29:49.517 --> 01:29:50.551
LITTLE BIT.

01:29:50.618 --> 01:29:52.186
MISSING HERE YEAH I THINK IT

01:29:52.253 --> 01:29:53.888
SHOULD BE OFTEN.

01:29:53.955 --> 01:29:54.655
WHEN IT WHEN IT COMES TO YOUR

01:29:54.722 --> 01:29:57.058
HOME IT SHOULD BE OFTEN YOU KNOW

01:29:57.125 --> 01:29:58.726
BECAUSE THESE ARE VERY PROUD

01:29:58.793 --> 01:30:00.228
THIS IS THE MOST PRIVATE?

01:30:00.294 --> 01:30:02.163
YOU KNOW SACRED PLACE IN THE

01:30:02.230 --> 01:30:03.331
WORLD IS THE HOME.

01:30:03.397 --> 01:30:05.032
YOU KNOW AND WE AND I THINK

01:30:05.099 --> 01:30:06.400
WE'VE ALWAYS AGREED UPON THAT

01:30:06.467 --> 01:30:08.069
AND SO.

01:30:08.136 --> 01:30:09.670
YES I THINK IT SHOULD BE OFTEN

01:30:09.737 --> 01:30:11.739
ALSO THERE SHOULD BE A NOTICE

01:30:11.806 --> 01:30:13.007
ABOUT HEY HOW IS THIS.

01:30:13.074 --> 01:30:14.442
BEING USED AND I THINK THAT'S

01:30:14.509 --> 01:30:17.178
ALSO THE INTENT HERE IS IS TO IS

01:30:17.245 --> 01:30:19.113
TO REALLY CLEARLY SAY WHAT ARE

01:30:19.180 --> 01:30:20.348
YOU GOING TO BE DOING ARE YOU

01:30:20.414 --> 01:30:21.949
GOING TO BE RECORDING.

01:30:22.016 --> 01:30:23.317
INFORMATION SO THAT PEOPLE KNOW

01:30:23.384 --> 01:30:25.086
THAT NOW YES WE BALD NOW

01:30:25.153 --> 01:30:26.854
DISCOVERED THAT AMAZON DOES THIS

01:30:26.921 --> 01:30:28.322
ONLY BECAUSE IT BROKE IN A NEWS

01:30:28.389 --> 01:30:30.158
STORY NOT BECAUSE THEY CAME

01:30:30.224 --> 01:30:32.093
FORWARD AND VOLUNTARILY GAVE

01:30:32.160 --> 01:30:34.328
THAT INFORMATION OUT TO PEOPLE --

01:30:34.395 --> 01:30:35.696
WE DIDN'T FIND OUT ABOUT GOOGLE

01:30:35.763 --> 01:30:38.299
NAST BECAUSE GOOGLE DECIDED.

01:30:38.366 --> 01:30:40.301
TO FINALLY TO FINALLY TELL US

01:30:40.368 --> 01:30:42.003
ABOUT THAT -- YOU KNOW IT'S IS

01:30:42.069 --> 01:30:43.437
AGAIN THIS STUFF SHOULD BE ON

01:30:43.504 --> 01:30:47.341
THE FRONT END HERE'S HOW WE'RE

01:30:47.408 --> 01:30:49.477
DOING THIS ARE YOU OKAY WITH IT.

01:30:49.544 --> 01:30:50.611
NO IN AND IT'S EITHER YES OR NO

01:30:50.678 --> 01:30:51.279
AND AND LOOK I THINK THERE IS A

01:30:51.345 --> 01:30:54.215
WORKABLE WAY OF DOING THAT WHILE

01:30:54.282 --> 01:30:55.683
STILL GIVING YOU THE BENEFIT.

01:30:55.750 --> 01:30:57.718
OF WHAT THIS TECHNOLOGY PROVIDES

01:30:57.785 --> 01:30:58.920
AND I THINK THAT'S REALLY THE

01:30:58.986 --> 01:30:59.954
YOU KNOW THE FUNDAMENTAL THING

01:31:00.021 --> 01:31:01.455
OF WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO WITH

01:31:01.522 --> 01:31:03.224
THIS BILL -- CERTAINLY WILL

01:31:03.291 --> 01:31:04.492
CONTINUE TO WORK THROUGH SOME OF

01:31:04.559 --> 01:31:06.861
THE TWEAKS AT I THINK WHAT MY

01:31:06.928 --> 01:31:09.063
COLLEAGUE -- FROM BIG BEAR LAKE

01:31:09.130 --> 01:31:10.164
HAS BROUGHT UP IS IS SOME VERY

01:31:10.231 --> 01:31:11.566
GOOD POINTS ABOUT HOW THIS

01:31:11.632 --> 01:31:12.800
ACTUALLY WORKS IN.

01:31:12.867 --> 01:31:15.203
FUNNY WAYS TO ACTUALLY YOU KNOW --

01:31:15.269 --> 01:31:17.839
ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS -- BUT

01:31:17.905 --> 01:31:19.640
AGAIN THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE

01:31:19.707 --> 01:31:20.942
HERE IS THAT YES YOU KNOW.

01:31:21.008 --> 01:31:23.144
IF IF OTHERS ARE GOING TO BE

01:31:23.211 --> 01:31:25.513

OR THEIR RECORDINGS THAT HAVE

01:31:34.956 --> 01:31:36.624
BEEN RANDOMLY TAKEN FROM

01:31:36.691 --> 01:31:38.326
CONVERSATIONS IN THE HOME AND I

01:31:38.392 --> 01:31:39.460
GUESS MAYBE THE ONE OF THE

01:31:39.527 --> 01:31:40.695
PROBLEMS IS.

01:31:40.761 --> 01:31:43.831

AS CHAIR RIGHT.

01:31:45.867 --> 01:31:47.401
AND SO.

01:31:47.468 --> 01:31:49.237
THE WAY IT SO WHEN YOU USE THE

01:31:49.303 --> 01:31:50.571
WAKE WORD OF THE HOT WHEREVER

01:31:50.638 --> 01:31:52.073

BUT THOSE ARE NEVER STORED OR

01:32:00.214 --> 01:32:02.116
TRANSMITTED TO THE CLOUD OR THE

01:32:02.183 --> 01:32:02.350
SERVER.

01:32:02.416 --> 01:32:03.851
OR WHATEVER STORING IN SO DOING

01:32:03.918 --> 01:32:05.786
THINGS THAT ARE STORED IS WHEN

01:32:05.853 --> 01:32:07.121
YOU USE THE HOT WORD OR WAKE

01:32:07.188 --> 01:32:09.257

WHAT I'M TELLING YOU BUT IF THE

01:32:12.493 --> 01:32:13.928
IF THE CONSUMER WANTS TO ENSURE

01:32:13.995 --> 01:32:15.296
THAT THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING.

01:32:15.363 --> 01:32:16.931
THEY CAN GO INTO THEIR ACCOUNT

01:32:16.998 --> 01:32:19.433
ON THEIR APPS -- OR ONLINE INTO

01:32:19.500 --> 01:32:21.302
THEIR ACCOUNT AND SEE EVERYTHING

01:32:21.369 --> 01:32:23.304
THE DEVICES RECORDED AND THEY

01:32:23.371 --> 01:32:24.739
CAN LEAVE THOSE RECORDINGS THERE

01:32:24.805 --> 01:32:26.140
IF THEY WANT THE DEVICE TO

01:32:26.207 --> 01:32:27.375
CONTINUE TO LEARN HOW THEIR

01:32:27.441 --> 01:32:29.377
SPEECH WORKS OR THEY CAN GO IN

01:32:29.443 --> 01:32:30.845
AND MANUALLY AND DELETE EVERY

01:32:30.912 --> 01:32:32.313
SINGLE ONE OF THOSE RECORDINGS

01:32:32.380 --> 01:32:32.613
OR RECORD.

01:32:32.680 --> 01:32:34.448
OR DELETE SOME OF THE RECORDINGS

01:32:34.515 --> 01:32:35.583
OR WHATEVER THEY WANT TO DO BUT

01:32:35.650 --> 01:32:37.318
THEY CAN MANAGE THOSE RECORDINGS

01:32:37.385 --> 01:32:38.986
THAT'S ALREADY THAT ALREADY

01:32:39.053 --> 01:32:40.821
EXISTS THE COMPANIES HAVE GIVEN

01:32:40.888 --> 01:32:42.323
CONSUMERS CONTROL OVER THIS

01:32:42.390 --> 01:32:43.491
TECHNOLOGY.

01:32:43.557 --> 01:32:44.425
AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT YOU KNOW

01:32:44.492 --> 01:32:45.826
WE KEEP HEARING IS CAN YOU WANT

01:32:45.893 --> 01:32:47.328
CONSUMER CONTROL THAT ALREADY

01:32:47.395 --> 01:32:50.598
EXISTS WITHIN CCPA THE NOTICES

01:32:50.665 --> 01:32:52.600
IN EXISTENCE THE CPA AND THEN

01:32:52.667 --> 01:32:53.601
THEY ALSO EXIST WITH WHAT

01:32:53.668 --> 01:32:55.336
MANUFACTURERS HAVE DONE TO MAKE

01:32:55.403 --> 01:32:56.504
SURE THAT CONSUMERS.

01:32:56.570 --> 01:33:01.342
ARE TRUSTING THEIR DEVICES IN

01:33:01.409 --> 01:33:02.276
THEIR HOMES.

01:33:02.343 --> 01:33:02.944
IN IT AND I THINK THAT'S PART OF

01:33:03.010 --> 01:33:03.544
THIS IS LIKE LET'S PUT THAT ON

01:33:03.611 --> 01:33:04.178
THE FRONT END.

01:33:04.245 --> 01:33:05.947
YOU KNOW IT'S REALLY PUT THAT ON

01:33:06.013 --> 01:33:07.782
THE FRONT AND HERE'S WHAT WE DO --

01:33:07.848 --> 01:33:09.183
BECAUSE THAT HASN'T BEEN DONE I

01:33:09.250 --> 01:33:10.451
MEAN I THINK UNDER THE STATUS

01:33:10.518 --> 01:33:12.053
QUO THAT'S NOT WHAT'S HAPPENING

01:33:12.119 --> 01:33:13.087
I MEAN YOU FIND OUT ABOUT THIS

01:33:13.154 --> 01:33:14.288
SORT OF WAY -- YOU CAN GO ON

01:33:14.355 --> 01:33:16.457
YOUR PRIVACY PROTECTIONS BUT I

01:33:16.524 --> 01:33:17.024
DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH THAT'S

01:33:17.091 --> 01:33:18.492
REALLY.

01:33:18.559 --> 01:33:20.895
OUT THERE AT THE OUTSET.

01:33:20.962 --> 01:33:23.531
IF MR GABRIEL GO AHEAD.

01:33:23.597 --> 01:33:24.598
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SIR JUST

01:33:24.665 --> 01:33:25.232
A QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR I YOU

01:33:25.299 --> 01:33:26.567
KNOW I KNOW HERE THAT THAT WE'RE

01:33:26.634 --> 01:33:28.336
DEFINING SMART SPEAKER DEVICES

01:33:28.402 --> 01:33:29.470
TO FIND IS NOT INCLUDING A

01:33:29.537 --> 01:33:30.538
CELLULAR TELEPHONE AND SO I'M

01:33:30.604 --> 01:33:32.073
JUST CURIOUS ABOUT WHY THAT

01:33:32.139 --> 01:33:33.374
DECISION WAS MADE [inaudible]

01:33:33.441 --> 01:33:37.678
WELL THE MY ORIGINAL INTENT WAS

01:33:37.745 --> 01:33:39.814
TO FOCUS THIS.

01:33:39.880 --> 01:33:41.716
WITHOUT BEING TOO TECHNOLOGICAL

01:33:41.782 --> 01:33:44.418
TECHNOLOGY SPECIFIC AT DEVICES

01:33:44.485 --> 01:33:46.053
THAT ARE IN THE HOME.

01:33:46.120 --> 01:33:48.489
AND WE'RE AS CELLULAR TELEPHONES

01:33:48.556 --> 01:33:49.690
POSE A DIFFERENT.

01:33:49.757 --> 01:33:51.092
SET OF ISSUES I THINK IN THE

01:33:51.158 --> 01:33:54.495
ATTEMPTING -- TO APPLY NEW LOSS

01:33:54.562 --> 01:33:56.263
OF THEM BECAUSE THEY TRAVEL

01:33:56.330 --> 01:33:57.398
EVERYWHERE WITH YOU.

01:33:57.465 --> 01:34:00.101
I GO TO YOUR CAR THEY GO HERE

01:34:00.167 --> 01:34:02.136
COMMITTEES THEY GO.

01:34:02.203 --> 01:34:03.471
TO NOW YOUR BALL GAMES THEY ALL

01:34:03.537 --> 01:34:04.205
OVER THE PLACE.

01:34:04.271 --> 01:34:06.774
SO -- IS THAT THAT'S THE REASON

01:34:06.841 --> 01:34:08.042
FOR THE DISTINCTION.

01:34:08.109 --> 01:34:10.578
I MEAN I THINK THE WAY.

01:34:10.644 --> 01:34:16.417
IT'S DRAFTED NOW -- IT MAY NOTED

01:34:16.484 --> 01:34:18.352
SAYS CONNECTED DEVICE WITH THE

01:34:18.419 --> 01:34:20.187
VOICE RECOGNITION FEATURE.

01:34:20.254 --> 01:34:22.556
AND THAT'S OF THIS ABOUT

01:34:22.623 --> 01:34:23.624
PROBABLY AS NEUTRAL AS WE CAN

01:34:23.691 --> 01:34:23.924
[inaudible]

01:34:23.991 --> 01:34:28.529
GET AS I'M SORRY SO THAT IS AS

01:34:28.596 --> 01:34:29.363
YOU CAN BECAUSE YOU CAN YOU KNOW

01:34:29.430 --> 01:34:30.231
LOOK AT THE HOUSES AS A SMART

01:34:30.297 --> 01:34:31.699
SPEAKER DEVICE SHALL NOT INCLUDE

01:34:31.766 --> 01:34:36.470
A CELLULAR TELEPHONE -- IF I

01:34:36.537 --> 01:34:37.071
COULD HAVE MY WHAT I THINK I

01:34:37.138 --> 01:34:38.072
THINK THE AMENDMENT DOES SO

01:34:38.139 --> 01:34:40.408
PROVIDE FOR THE CELL OF OF PHONE

01:34:40.474 --> 01:34:44.145
ON PAGE -- EIGHT SECTION BE.

01:34:44.211 --> 01:34:45.546
SECOND PARAGRAPH -- SECOND TO

01:34:45.613 --> 01:34:47.748
THE LAST LINE I THINK IT DOES

01:34:47.815 --> 01:34:53.554
INCLUDE A SOLAR PHONE.

01:34:53.621 --> 01:34:54.889
IF I MADE IT THROUGH THE CHAIR.

01:34:54.955 --> 01:34:56.891
ONE AMPLIFICATION OF OF RECKLESS

01:34:56.957 --> 01:34:58.459
TWO APPLICATIONS THE FIRST IS

01:34:58.526 --> 01:34:59.493
THE BLOOMBERG STOCK BLOOMBERG

01:34:59.560 --> 01:35:01.395
STORY DID -- DISCLOSE THAT IT

01:35:01.462 --> 01:35:03.030
WASN'T JUST WAKE WORDS THAT WERE

01:35:03.097 --> 01:35:05.366
BEING RECORDED BUT I BELIEVE IT

01:35:05.433 --> 01:35:08.302
WAS WELL OVER A HUNDRED WORDS

01:35:08.369 --> 01:35:10.137
PER DAY SO IT IT WAS NOT SIMPLY

01:35:10.204 --> 01:35:11.539
THAT THE SIGNAL WORK THAT WAS

01:35:11.605 --> 01:35:13.641
BEING RECORDED BUT A MUCH MORE

01:35:13.707 --> 01:35:14.542
SUBSTANCE.

01:35:14.608 --> 01:35:17.845
THAN THAT.

01:35:17.912 --> 01:35:20.948
ON ALL BUT ONE OTHER.

01:35:21.015 --> 01:35:22.216
THE THE THE ASSEMBLYMEMBER

01:35:22.283 --> 01:35:23.517
OBERNOLTE IS POINTS ARE ALWAYS

01:35:23.584 --> 01:35:25.319
EXTRAORDINARILY WELL AFFORDABLE

01:35:25.386 --> 01:35:26.153
TAKEN ON THESE MATTERS -- OF THE

01:35:26.220 --> 01:35:27.121
TECHNICAL MATTERS THE ONE THING

01:35:27.188 --> 01:35:27.655
I WILL NOTE IS THAT THE

01:35:27.721 --> 01:35:30.391
PROTECTIONS AFFORDED TO THE BILL

01:35:30.458 --> 01:35:31.559
GO TO TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:35:31.625 --> 01:35:33.127
GALLAGHER'S POINT.

01:35:33.194 --> 01:35:33.761
WHICH IS THAT WHAT WE'RE REALLY

01:35:33.828 --> 01:35:35.963
TALKING ABOUT HERE.

01:35:36.030 --> 01:35:37.565
THE TECHNICAL ISSUES.

01:35:37.631 --> 01:35:38.599
THAT NEED TO BE AMPLIFIED AND

01:35:38.666 --> 01:35:39.066
RESULT.

01:35:39.133 --> 01:35:43.003
IS WHAT DO YOU DO ABOUT IT.

01:35:43.070 --> 01:35:44.338
AND THE THINGS THAT ARE REQUIRED

01:35:44.405 --> 01:35:46.140
BY THIS BILL.

01:35:46.207 --> 01:35:49.443
FRANKLY EMBRACE BOTH KINDS OF

01:35:49.510 --> 01:35:50.244
SENSITIVITIES TO PERSONAL

01:35:50.311 --> 01:35:52.480

A RETENTION BETTER OF WAKE WORDS

01:36:01.188 --> 01:36:03.624
OR SIGNAL WORDS BUT OTHERS MAY.

01:36:03.691 --> 01:36:05.893
AND WHAT THE BILL PERMITS IS

01:36:05.960 --> 01:36:08.929
BOTH SENSITIVITIES TO BE

01:36:08.996 --> 01:36:09.964
PROTECTED.

01:36:10.030 --> 01:36:11.165
BECAUSE IF DURING THE INITIAL

01:36:11.232 --> 01:36:12.066
STAGE OF THE SET UP FOR

01:36:12.133 --> 01:36:13.167

LIKEWISE YOU MAY CONSENT -- IN

01:36:23.978 --> 01:36:26.147
WRITING WHERE SOMEONE WITH A

01:36:26.213 --> 01:36:27.281
DIFFERENT SENSITIVITY.

01:36:27.348 --> 01:36:28.415
MAY COME TO A DIFFERENT

01:36:28.482 --> 01:36:31.685
CONCLUSION AND THAT'S THE WAY

01:36:31.752 --> 01:36:33.020
THAT WE PRETTY MUCH PROTECT

01:36:33.087 --> 01:36:34.021
PRIVACY IN AMERICA.

01:36:34.088 --> 01:36:38.058
THAT IS BY ALLOWING CONSUMERS --

01:36:38.125 --> 01:36:39.293
THE INFORMATION UP FRONT.

01:36:39.360 --> 01:36:41.695

REQUIRING EITHER AN OPT IN OR

01:36:46.767 --> 01:36:48.002
OPT OUT.

01:36:48.068 --> 01:36:50.704
IN THAT WAY ALL THE WHOLE GAMUT

01:36:50.771 --> 01:36:52.339
OF PERSONAL SENSITIVITIES WHEN

01:36:52.406 --> 01:36:53.607
IT COMES TO PRIVACY.

01:36:53.674 --> 01:36:55.242
ARE PROTECTED AT THE MOST

01:36:55.309 --> 01:36:57.878
INDIVIDUAL LEVEL AND SUBJECTIVE

01:36:57.945 --> 01:36:58.412
LEVEL HUMANLY POSSIBLE AND

01:36:58.479 --> 01:37:01.949
THAT'S WHY IT WAS SUCH A IT

01:37:02.016 --> 01:37:03.017
INSPIRED SUGGESTION.

01:37:03.083 --> 01:37:04.251
MISTER CHAIRMAN OF FROM THE

01:37:04.318 --> 01:37:07.454
COMMITTEE TO SIMPLY ADD THIS ON

TO THE MOST ANALOGOUS PRODUCT

01:37:09.056 --> 01:37:10.424
THAT ALREADY EXISTS.

01:37:10.491 --> 01:37:13.494
IN CURRENT LAW.

01:37:13.561 --> 01:37:16.864
WHICH WAS THAT THE TELEVISION.

01:37:16.931 --> 01:37:18.199
WITH THE TEARS FROM JUST LIKE TO

OTHER CONNECTED DEVICE WITH THE

01:37:31.679 --> 01:37:32.780
VOICE RECOGNITION FEATURE.

01:37:32.846 --> 01:37:34.615
I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR ON ON ON

01:37:34.682 --> 01:37:35.149
ON THE RECORD AS THE CHAIR

01:37:35.216 --> 01:37:37.785

01:37:37.851 --> 01:37:40.988
ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS SIR.

01:37:41.055 --> 01:37:41.956
YES -- FOR UNDERGRAD.

01:37:42.022 --> 01:37:43.757
NO FILIBUSTER FOR A LITTLE BIT

01:37:43.824 --> 01:37:46.660
WELL ACTUALLY DECIDED I'M GONNA

01:37:46.727 --> 01:37:52.733
VOTE -- BECAUSE BECAUSE OKAY

01:37:52.800 --> 01:38:00.241
BECAUSE I'M STRUGGLING -- THAT'S

01:38:00.307 --> 01:38:03.210
RIGHT -- SO I HAVE A LOT OF

01:38:03.277 --> 01:38:04.311
CONCERNS AND I THINK OF THIS FOR

01:38:04.378 --> 01:38:05.613
THE FINAL FORM OF THE BILL I

01:38:05.679 --> 01:38:07.181
DEFINITELY GO NO -- HI IT'S IT'S

01:38:07.248 --> 01:38:09.149
EASY TO SAY YOU KNOW -- WILL YOU

01:38:09.216 --> 01:38:11.485
KNOW CERTAIN DEVICES YOU KNOW IF

01:38:11.552 --> 01:38:13.120
YOU CAN SEND THEM THE DEVICE

01:38:13.187 --> 01:38:15.756
WILL BE ABLE TO USE -- YOU KNOW --

01:38:15.823 --> 01:38:17.791
A AYE TECHNOLOGY THE BETTER

01:38:17.858 --> 01:38:19.593
PERFECT THE USER EXPERIENCE --

01:38:19.660 --> 01:38:21.295
AND THEN IF SO IF YOU IF YOU

01:38:21.362 --> 01:38:22.997
DON'T WANT THAT THEN YOU CAN

01:38:23.063 --> 01:38:24.765
VOLUNTARILY NOT HAVE THAT BUT

01:38:24.832 --> 01:38:25.666
IT'S NOT ACTUALLY THAT THAT'S

01:38:25.733 --> 01:38:27.167
ACTUALLY INCREDIBLY COMPLICATED

01:38:27.234 --> 01:38:29.203
IN TERMS OF THE IMPACT THAT HAS.

01:38:29.270 --> 01:38:30.671
IN IN THE MARKET PLACE BECAUSE

01:38:30.738 --> 01:38:33.007
PEOPLE WHO SAY WELL I DON'T WANT

01:38:33.073 --> 01:38:34.608
YOU TO USE A I'D TO TO PERFECT

01:38:34.675 --> 01:38:36.176
THE EXPERIENCE BUT THEN THEY'RE

01:38:36.243 --> 01:38:38.479
GONNA GET ON REVIEW SITES AND

01:38:38.545 --> 01:38:40.214
TRASH OUR PRODUCTS.

01:38:40.281 --> 01:38:40.781
BECAUSE THEY'RE ESSENTIALLY

01:38:40.848 --> 01:38:43.317
USING AN INFERIOR PRODUCT -- AND

01:38:43.384 --> 01:38:44.451
THEY CHOSE TO USE AN INFERIOR

01:38:44.518 --> 01:38:46.987
PRODUCT BUT THEN THEY GO ON IT

01:38:47.054 --> 01:38:48.922
IN IN INTO THE TO THE DOMAIN OF

01:38:48.989 --> 01:38:51.325
OF REVIEWS AND THEY TRASHED THE

01:38:51.392 --> 01:38:52.726
PRODUCT WITHOUT NECESSARILY

01:38:52.793 --> 01:38:54.061
SAYING HEY BY THE WAY.

01:38:54.128 --> 01:38:55.296
I'M REALLY USING AN INFERIOR

01:38:55.362 --> 01:38:56.764
PRODUCT BECAUSE I VOLUNTARILY

01:38:56.830 --> 01:38:58.165
MADE THAT CHOICE BY THIS PRODUCT

01:38:58.232 --> 01:39:00.234
SUCKS WHEN I DON'T WANT TO DO

01:39:00.301 --> 01:39:00.834
ALL THAT IT REALLY SHOULD BE

01:39:00.901 --> 01:39:03.437
ABLE TO DO -- AND I DON'T THINK

01:39:03.504 --> 01:39:05.673
THAT'S FAIR TO TO THE COMPANY --

01:39:05.739 --> 01:39:07.408
WAIT WHICH DO WHO DESIGNS THE

01:39:07.474 --> 01:39:08.742
PRODUCT IN A WAY THAT'S MEANT TO

01:39:08.809 --> 01:39:10.544
MAXIMIZE THE THE USER EXPERIENCE

01:39:10.611 --> 01:39:11.979
WHEN A USER DECIDES VOLUNTARILY

01:39:12.046 --> 01:39:14.181
NOT. TO AVAIL THEMSELVES OF OF

01:39:14.248 --> 01:39:15.649
THAT OPPORTUNITY -- AND SO I

01:39:15.716 --> 01:39:16.850
THINK THAT'S JUST MUCH MORE

01:39:16.917 --> 01:39:18.652
COMPLICATED THAN THAN IT SOUNDS

01:39:18.719 --> 01:39:20.054
WHEN YOU TO SAY YOU CAN

01:39:20.120 --> 01:39:21.422
VOLUNTARILY USE IT OR NOT --

01:39:21.488 --> 01:39:22.623
BECAUSE THAT HAS A BROADER

01:39:22.690 --> 01:39:24.591
IMPACT ON ON THE REPUTATION OF

01:39:24.658 --> 01:39:25.826
THE COMPANY AND AND THE

01:39:25.893 --> 01:39:28.295
REPUTATION OF THE PRODUCT -- I

01:39:28.362 --> 01:39:29.530
THINK THE IDEA OF SENDING IN A A

01:39:29.596 --> 01:39:31.565
POSTCARD OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT

01:39:31.632 --> 01:39:33.000
IS MUCH MORE ONEROUS THAN WE

01:39:33.067 --> 01:39:34.635
MAKE IT SOUND LIKE IT IS I MEAN

01:39:34.702 --> 01:39:35.803
I GOT A NEW DISHWASHER.

01:39:35.869 --> 01:39:37.338
THEY GIVE ME A LITTLE CARD TO

01:39:37.404 --> 01:39:42.643
GET THE WARRANTY AND I I DID YOU

01:39:42.710 --> 01:39:44.044
KNOW.

01:39:44.111 --> 01:39:45.212
WHAT WAS GONNA NOT BOTHER

01:39:45.279 --> 01:39:45.713
FILLING IT OUT BECAUSE I

01:39:45.779 --> 01:39:46.980
COULDN'T BE BOTHERED ON THAT I

01:39:47.047 --> 01:39:48.615
COULD AT LEAST LIKE TO TAKE A?

01:39:48.682 --> 01:39:49.817
CUE OUR SCAN OF A CO I MEAN I

01:39:49.883 --> 01:39:51.185
COULD DO IT A LOT EASIER.

01:39:51.251 --> 01:39:52.252
THAN IT THAN SENDING A POSTCARD

01:39:52.319 --> 01:39:53.687
BY THE SENATE A POSTCARD I

01:39:53.754 --> 01:39:56.156
PROBABLY SAID FORGET IT.

01:39:56.223 --> 01:39:57.157
FORGET FORGET MY POSTCARD IDEA.

01:39:57.224 --> 01:39:59.059
BUT YOU KNOW EMAIL OR OR SOME OR

01:39:59.126 --> 01:40:00.294
TAKE A PICTURE AND SEND IT TO

01:40:00.361 --> 01:40:00.761
SOME MAYBE THERE YEAH

01:40:00.828 --> 01:40:02.162
TECHNOLOGICAL SOLUTION I'M SURE

01:40:02.229 --> 01:40:03.964
TO THE WRITTEN CONSENT ISSUE

01:40:04.031 --> 01:40:05.866
YEAH -- I MEAN I I I TOTALLY

01:40:05.933 --> 01:40:07.835
AGREE WITH YOU THAT COMPANIES

01:40:07.901 --> 01:40:09.403
NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB.

01:40:09.470 --> 01:40:12.072
OF MAKING THEIR THEIR CONSUMERS

01:40:12.139 --> 01:40:14.308
AWARE OF ALL THAT IS HAPPENING

01:40:14.375 --> 01:40:16.143
WITH THE PRODUCT THAT THEY BY

01:40:16.210 --> 01:40:17.745
AND AND SO FOR THAT.

01:40:17.811 --> 01:40:18.345
YOU KNOW YOU AND I ARE TOTALLY

01:40:18.412 --> 01:40:23.150
ALIGNED -- I I THINK THAT AND IF --

01:40:23.217 --> 01:40:25.819
HE COMPANIES OR THE DOING MORE

01:40:25.886 --> 01:40:27.187
THAN THEY SAY THEY'RE DOING I

01:40:27.254 --> 01:40:27.921
MEAN IF THEY SAY THAT THEY'RE

01:40:27.988 --> 01:40:29.289
JUST RECORDING SO YOU KNOW

01:40:29.356 --> 01:40:30.657
CERTAIN PHRASES TO BUT IT TO

01:40:30.724 --> 01:40:31.859
BETTER THE EXPERIENCE.

01:40:31.925 --> 01:40:32.693
THAT'S ONE THING IF THEY'RE

01:40:32.760 --> 01:40:34.094
ACTUALLY RECORD YOU KNOW

01:40:34.161 --> 01:40:36.163
RECORDING A LOT MORE AND USING

01:40:36.230 --> 01:40:37.865
THAT INFORMATION TO THEN.

01:40:37.931 --> 01:40:40.000
YEAH -- THE SELL THAT TO PEOPLE

01:40:40.067 --> 01:40:41.535
WHO THEN MARKET CERTAIN PRODUCTS

01:40:41.602 --> 01:40:43.170
TO YOU FOR EXAMPLE I THINK

01:40:43.237 --> 01:40:46.807
THAT'S YOU KNOW PRETTY BAD -- IT

01:40:46.874 --> 01:40:48.342
AWFUL IT IF IF YOU HAVEN'T

01:40:48.409 --> 01:40:49.710
ACTUALLY CONSENTED TO THE USE OF

01:40:49.777 --> 01:40:51.078
YOUR PRIVATE CONVERSATIONS IN

01:40:51.145 --> 01:40:53.480
THAT WAY -- AND AND SO I THINK

01:40:53.547 --> 01:40:55.048
THAT IT YOU KNOW THAT IS ONE

01:40:55.115 --> 01:40:57.384
THING I THINK -- YEAH RECORDING

01:40:57.451 --> 01:40:58.619
THE DATA SO THAT THEY CAN BETTER

01:40:58.685 --> 01:41:00.954
PERFECT THE PRODUCTS BEFORE FOR

01:41:01.021 --> 01:41:02.389
YOU IS IT IS A DIFFERENT.

01:41:02.456 --> 01:41:04.258
IS A DIFFERENT SET OF ISSUES I

01:41:04.324 --> 01:41:05.159
ALSO THINK AND YOU AND I HAVE AT

01:41:05.225 --> 01:41:06.660
SOME PRIVATE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT

01:41:06.727 --> 01:41:08.629
DE IDENTIFIED DATA -- IN AND

01:41:08.695 --> 01:41:10.164
WHETHER OR NOT DATA THAT'S THE

01:41:10.230 --> 01:41:15.135
IDENTIFIED SHOULD REALLY FALL

01:41:15.202 --> 01:41:19.773
UNDER THE SAME AND THEN USED FOR

01:41:19.840 --> 01:41:21.809
MARKETING PURPOSES OR THE LIKE

01:41:21.875 --> 01:41:22.943
AND AND SO I THINK.

01:41:23.010 --> 01:41:23.877
THERE NEEDS TO BE THE

01:41:23.944 --> 01:41:25.646
DELINEATION BETWEEN THOSE THINGS

01:41:25.712 --> 01:41:26.947
IN THE BILL AND AND DIFFERENT

01:41:27.014 --> 01:41:28.849
DATA TREATED.

01:41:28.916 --> 01:41:29.316
DIFFERENTLY.

01:41:29.383 --> 01:41:30.984
BECAUSE IT HAS A DIFFERENT

01:41:31.051 --> 01:41:32.986
IMPACT ON OUR ON OUR PART YOU

01:41:33.053 --> 01:41:36.924
KNOW PRIVACY RIGHTS -- SO

01:41:36.990 --> 01:41:38.625
THERE'S A LOT AND THERE'S A LOT

01:41:38.692 --> 01:41:40.527
THAT IS IN IN HERE YET.

01:41:40.594 --> 01:41:43.797
AND AND I I DON'T KNOW.

01:41:43.864 --> 01:41:45.165

RIGHT POLICY AT THE END OF THE

01:41:55.242 --> 01:41:55.943
DAY SO.

01:41:56.009 --> 01:41:58.345
I'M GONNA STOP FILIBUSTERING

02:03:24.230 --> 02:03:26.665
THE WAY THAT YOU DEFINE MARKET

02:03:26.732 --> 02:03:28.400

THAT MARKET PLACE HAS A PHYSICAL

02:03:34.473 --> 02:03:36.075
PRESENCE IN THE STATE AND I

02:03:36.142 --> 02:03:38.444
WONDERED IF THAT WASN'T SETTING

02:03:38.511 --> 02:03:41.113
US UP FOR PRE EMPTION UNDER THE

02:03:41.180 --> 02:03:42.882
FEDERAL CONSTITUTIONS INTERSTATE

02:03:42.948 --> 02:03:44.450

FOR YEARS OVER -- THE

02:03:47.753 --> 02:03:49.688

JUST RECENTLY WE GOT A SUPREME

02:03:53.926 --> 02:03:55.427
COURT RULING THAT ALLOWED US TO

02:03:55.494 --> 02:03:56.929

02:03:56.996 --> 02:03:57.797
SEEMS LIKE.

02:03:57.863 --> 02:04:00.199
THIS KIND OF REGULATION IS A LOT

02:04:00.266 --> 02:04:03.669

02:07:11.724 --> 02:07:12.491
I WOULD SAY IN MANY WAYS MAYBE

02:07:12.558 --> 02:07:14.960
IS LEAD TO LOWER PRICES.

02:07:15.027 --> 02:07:17.529
RIGHT BE ABLE TO ACCESS THINGS

02:07:17.596 --> 02:07:19.765
AT LOWER PRICES -- BUT IS ALSO

02:07:19.832 --> 02:07:21.967
IT'S BECOME KIND OF A MAIN HUB

02:07:22.034 --> 02:07:23.869
OF COMMERCE.

02:07:23.936 --> 02:07:26.972
IN THE SAME WAY THAT IT YOU KNOW.

02:07:27.039 --> 02:07:28.474
UPWARDS OF VIA.

02:07:28.540 --> 02:07:31.643
MY BELIEVE THE CONTENT WAS 5260%.

02:07:31.710 --> 02:07:32.544
OF THE E. COMMERCE MARKET AT

02:07:32.611 --> 02:07:35.447
THIS POINT IN TIME -- AND AND IN

02:07:35.514 --> 02:07:37.416
SUCH A WAY AS WE HAVE SEEN

02:07:37.483 --> 02:07:38.617
ISSUES WITH.

02:07:38.684 --> 02:07:40.486
IT MAKES IT HARD FOR SMALLER MOM

02:07:40.552 --> 02:07:43.522
AND POP BUSINESSES -- TO TO

02:07:43.589 --> 02:07:45.524
COMPETE OR ORDER BASICALLY HAVE

02:07:45.591 --> 02:07:46.992
TO USE THOSE.

02:07:47.059 --> 02:07:48.827
THOSE CHANNELS -- AND PAY

02:07:48.894 --> 02:07:52.431
ASSOCIATED FEES IN ORDER -- TO

02:07:52.498 --> 02:07:54.666
TO PARTICIPATE IN THAT AND THAT

02:07:54.733 --> 02:07:56.735
COMMERCE -- SO.

02:07:56.802 --> 02:07:59.138
YOU KNOW LOOK AT THE ISSUE HERE

02:07:59.204 --> 02:08:00.906
IS ONE THAT WE DO HAVE TO TO TRY

02:08:00.973 --> 02:08:02.241
AND ADDRESS NOW WE NEED TO DO IT

02:08:02.307 --> 02:08:06.145
IN A WAY -- ULTIMATELY THAT.

02:08:06.211 --> 02:08:07.312
HAD THAT IS WORK ONE IT SOUNDS

02:08:07.379 --> 02:08:08.580
LIKE WE'RE ALREADY WERE ALREADY

02:08:08.647 --> 02:08:10.282
KIND OF MAKING PROGRESS ON ON

02:08:10.349 --> 02:08:13.919
THAT FRONT -- BUT I AM CONCERNED

MORE MORE IN IN A C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; AS A&lt;/c&gt;</u>

02:08:21.393 --> 02:08:23.128
MONOPOLY POSITION WE PUT IT THAT

02:08:23.195 --> 02:08:26.565
WAY -- THAT IT COULD HAVE A LOT

02:08:26.632 --> 02:08:27.166
OF NEGATIVE IMPACT IN THIS IS

02:08:27.232 --> 02:08:28.600
THING THOUGH.

02:08:28.667 --> 02:08:31.370
AS MUCH AS YOU KNOW.

02:08:31.437 --> 02:08:32.671
I THINK WE AS REPUBLICANS HAVE

02:08:32.738 --> 02:08:34.673
ALWAYS BEEN CONCERNED CERTAINLY

02:08:34.740 --> 02:08:36.508
ABOUT GOVERNMENT REGULATION.

02:08:36.575 --> 02:08:40.712
CAN STIFLE COMPETITION -- WEEKLY

02:08:40.779 --> 02:08:42.181
IN THE PAST TO BE CONCERNED

POWER IN ONE COMPANY -- THAT

02:08:47.653 --> 02:08:49.955
COULD ALSO STIFLE COMPETITION

02:08:50.022 --> 02:08:51.824
AND ULTIMATELY INNOVATION.

02:08:51.890 --> 02:08:54.126

TO CHANGE OVER TIME AND THAT'S

02:09:18.517 --> 02:09:19.084
WHY GOVERNMENT WILL HAVE TO

AT AMAZON DOES OPERATE A

02:09:42.441 --> 02:09:43.475
MARKETPLACE BUT WE'RE CERTAINLY

02:09:43.542 --> 02:09:44.910
NOT THE ONLY -- ONLINE RETAILER

02:09:44.977 --> 02:09:45.911
THAT OPERATES A MARKETPLACE

02:09:45.978 --> 02:09:47.846
WALMART OPERATES A MARKETPLACE A

02:09:47.913 --> 02:09:48.914
GOOGLE OPERATES A MARKETPLACE OF

02:09:48.981 --> 02:09:49.915
COURSE EBAY HAS BEEN AROUND

02:09:49.982 --> 02:09:51.116
SINCE BEFORE WE HAVE BEEN THERE

02:09:51.183 --> 02:09:53.118
BEEN INCREASING NUMBERS OF

02:09:53.185 --> 02:09:54.720
ENTRANTS INTO THIS SPACE.

02:09:54.786 --> 02:09:56.555
JUST IN THE LAST FEW YEARS SO TO

02:09:56.622 --> 02:09:57.523
SUGGEST.

02:09:57.589 --> 02:09:59.525
THAT AMAZON SOMEHOW OPERATES OR

02:09:59.591 --> 02:10:01.727
ENJOYS A MONOPOLY POSITION -- IS

02:10:01.793 --> 02:10:03.228
RESPECTFULLY NOT CONSISTENT WITH

02:10:03.295 --> 02:10:04.329
WHAT WE'RE SEEING BECAUSE WE

02:10:04.396 --> 02:10:05.230
HAVE TO FIGHT EVERY DAY TO

02:10:11.904 --> 02:10:14.406
FACT -- RUNNING THOSE BY

02:10:14.473 --> 02:10:15.274
PROVIDING SELLERS WITH OTHER

02:10:15.340 --> 02:10:16.041
OPTIONS.

02:10:16.108 --> 02:10:17.409
AND WE'RE PROUD OF THE FACT THAT

02:10:17.476 --> 02:10:18.777
WE ENABLE SMALL MEDIUM SIZE

02:10:18.844 --> 02:10:21.046

02:15:21.079 --> 02:15:22.113
NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS ARE

02:15:22.180 --> 02:15:24.082
JUST ONE PIECE.

02:15:24.149 --> 02:15:25.350

ABILITY BUT ALSO PROVIDES A

02:15:56.214 --> 02:15:57.382
STRINGENT CAP RATHER THAN

WITH BIG DATA COMES BIG

02:16:22.073 --> 02:16:23.975
RESPONSIBILITY WE CANNOT ALLOW

THE HARD WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE

02:16:52.003 --> 02:16:53.471
AND THE OPEN DOOR THROUGHOUT

02:16:53.538 --> 02:16:54.873
THIS ENTIRE PROCESS SO JUST

AFTERNOON WELCOME TIMOTHY BLOOD

02:16:59.878 --> 02:17:01.346
ON BEHALF OF CONSUMER TREES OF

02:17:01.413 --> 02:17:03.548
CALIFORNIA A WE OPPOSE UNLESS

02:17:03.615 --> 02:17:03.815
AMENDED.

02:17:03.882 --> 02:17:05.150
I'M OUR ISSUE IS WITH THE TIME

02:17:05.216 --> 02:17:07.686
FRAME -- WITHIN FORTY FIVE DAYS

02:17:07.752 --> 02:17:09.654
IS TOO LONG -- OF COURSE THE

02:17:09.721 --> 02:17:11.356
PURPOSE OF THE NOTIFICATION --

02:17:11.423 --> 02:17:13.558
PROVISION IS TO NOTIFY CONSUMERS

02:17:13.625 --> 02:17:15.093
SO THEY CAN PROBABLY TAKE ACTION

02:17:15.160 --> 02:17:16.394
TO PROTECT THEMSELVES AGAINST

02:17:16.461 --> 02:17:17.529
IDENTITY THEFT.

02:17:17.596 --> 02:17:19.264
OR IF IDENTITY THEFT IS ALREADY

02:17:19.331 --> 02:17:20.899
OCCURRED TO MITIGATE THE

02:17:20.966 --> 02:17:23.134
CONSEQUENCES OF THAT IDENTITY

02:17:23.201 --> 02:17:23.935
THEFT.

02:17:24.002 --> 02:17:24.402
UP.

02:17:24.469 --> 02:17:25.637
TODAY WE CAN NOTIFY PEOPLE

02:17:25.704 --> 02:17:28.039
FASTER -- AND AT A LOWER COST

02:17:28.106 --> 02:17:29.407
THAN WE COULD TEN YEARS AGO AND

02:17:29.474 --> 02:17:30.675
OF COURSE THAT THAT IS GOING TO

02:17:30.742 --> 02:17:31.876
CONTINUE.

02:17:31.943 --> 02:17:34.145
AS WE MOVE FORWARD IN TIME ALSO

02:17:34.212 --> 02:17:36.314
DATA THIEVES ARE ABLE TO STEAL

02:17:36.381 --> 02:17:38.483
DATA FASTER THAN THEY COULD TEN

02:17:38.550 --> 02:17:41.019
YEARS AGO AND THAT IS ALSO GOING

02:17:41.086 --> 02:17:42.320
TO CONTINUE AS WE GO FORWARD.

02:17:42.387 --> 02:17:43.922
SO IT IT BECOMES A DIFFICULT

02:17:43.989 --> 02:17:49.694
TRICK IN PICKING A A TIME PERIOD.

02:17:49.761 --> 02:17:51.096
INSTITUTIONALIZING A TIME PERIOD

02:17:51.162 --> 02:17:52.297
THAT IS ACTUALLY GOING TO WORK --

02:17:52.364 --> 02:17:55.667
AS TECHNOLOGY ADVANCES UP WITHIN

02:17:55.734 --> 02:17:57.168
FORTY FIVE DAYS IS TOO LONG.

02:17:57.235 --> 02:17:59.204
UNDER TODAY'S CIRCUMSTANCES AND

02:17:59.270 --> 02:17:59.838
CERTAINLY WILL BE TOO LONG INTO

02:17:59.904 --> 02:18:01.773
THE FUTURE -- WE THINK THAT A

02:18:01.840 --> 02:18:03.742
BETTER MODEL IS THE

02:18:03.808 --> 02:18:05.310
CONFIDENTIALITY OF MEDICAL

02:18:05.377 --> 02:18:06.578
PRIVACY ACT.

02:18:06.645 --> 02:18:07.846
THAT PROVIDES THAT REQUIRES

02:18:07.912 --> 02:18:09.748
NOTIFICATION WITHIN FIFTEEN

02:18:09.814 --> 02:18:11.349
BUSINESS DAYS AS A CURRENT

02:18:11.416 --> 02:18:13.084
CALIFORNIA LAW THAT IS PLACED ON

02:18:13.151 --> 02:18:14.953
HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS WHERE

02:18:15.020 --> 02:18:15.820
INFORMATION.

02:18:15.887 --> 02:18:17.789
ABOUT MEDICAL INFORMATION IS

02:18:17.856 --> 02:18:19.724
TAKEN ON PATIENTS REQUIRES

02:18:19.791 --> 02:18:21.059
HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS TO PROVIDE

02:18:21.126 --> 02:18:22.827
NOTIFICATION WITHIN FIFTEEN

02:18:22.894 --> 02:18:23.762
BUSINESS DAYS.

02:18:23.828 --> 02:18:26.531
THAT HAS WORKED PERFECTLY FINE --

02:18:26.598 --> 02:18:27.532
THERE'S WE DON'T BELIEVE ANY

02:18:27.599 --> 02:18:29.100
REASON WHY IT WOULD NOT WORK

02:18:29.167 --> 02:18:31.236
FINE HERE ALSO THERE ARE OTHER

02:18:31.302 --> 02:18:33.371
STATES IN THE UNITED STATES THAT

02:18:33.438 --> 02:18:35.206
HAVE NOTIFICATION PROVISIONS.

02:18:35.273 --> 02:18:38.309
SIMILAR TO CALIFORNIA'S -- THOSE

02:18:38.376 --> 02:18:40.945
STATES ARE ARE AS LOW AS THIRTY

02:18:41.012 --> 02:18:42.013
DAYS AND AGAIN.

02:18:42.080 --> 02:18:43.114
THERE'S NO PROBLEM THAT THESE

02:18:43.181 --> 02:18:44.582
OTHER STATES HAVE IN COMPLYING

02:18:44.649 --> 02:18:45.984
WITH THOSE TIME PERIODS AND SO

02:18:46.051 --> 02:18:48.253
WE THINK FIFTEEN BUSINESS DAYS

02:18:48.319 --> 02:18:49.554
WOULD BE SUFFICIENT.

02:18:49.621 --> 02:18:52.791
AND SOMETIME IN THE FUTURE IT'S

02:18:52.857 --> 02:18:53.391
PROBABLY GOING TO BE EVEN LESS

02:18:53.458 --> 02:18:54.392
TIME THAN THAT.

02:18:54.459 --> 02:18:54.959
THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- NEXT

02:18:55.026 --> 02:18:58.430

WOULD LOVE TO BE IN SUPPORT OF

02:19:01.766 --> 02:19:02.467
THIS MEASURE HOWEVER WOULD

02:19:02.534 --> 02:19:03.668
AFFILIATE MY COMMENTS WITH THOSE

02:19:03.735 --> 02:19:04.869
OF THE CONSUMER ATTORNEYS WE DO

02:19:04.936 --> 02:19:06.571
HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT.

02:19:06.638 --> 02:19:08.339
THE FORTY FIVE DAY DURATION

02:19:08.406 --> 02:19:09.541
HAPPY TO CHAT WITH THE AUTHORS

02:19:09.607 --> 02:19:10.141

02:19:11.543 --> 02:19:13.845
ANALYSIS OF THESE PROVISIONS AND

02:19:33.732 --> 02:19:35.100
APPALLING STORIES ABOUT OUR DATA

02:19:35.166 --> 02:19:36.534
GETTING OUT ESPECIALLY WITH THE

02:19:36.601 --> 02:19:38.036
EQUIFAX BREACH AND AND I AGREE

02:19:38.103 --> 02:19:39.104
THAT CONSUMERS SHOULD BE

02:19:39.170 --> 02:19:40.205
NOTIFIED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND

02:19:40.271 --> 02:19:41.706
IT'S POSSIBLE TO DO IT IN

02:19:41.773 --> 02:19:42.407
FIFTEEN DAYS THAT WOULD BE GREAT --

02:19:42.474 --> 02:19:44.375
I APPRECIATE THE EXEMPTION --

02:19:44.442 --> 02:19:46.878
FOR ONGOING INVESTIGATIONS BUT

02:19:46.945 --> 02:19:48.246
WHAT WE'VE SEEN.

02:19:48.313 --> 02:19:49.781
AS WE'VE LOOKED AT AT THAT THERE

02:19:49.848 --> 02:19:52.917
ARE CERTAIN SYSTEMS THAT --

02:19:52.984 --> 02:19:54.786
THERE MIGHT JUST BE A PROBLEM

02:19:54.853 --> 02:19:56.521
PATCHING IT THAT QUICKLY.

02:19:56.588 --> 02:19:57.455
AND YOU KNOW THE SAME IS WITH

02:19:57.522 --> 02:19:59.424
YOUR IPHONE AND THE CONCERN IS

02:19:59.491 --> 02:20:02.060
THAT IF THE SYSTEM CANNOT BE.

02:20:02.127 --> 02:20:04.929
PATCHED IN FORTY FIVE DAYS --

02:20:04.996 --> 02:20:07.832
AND THEN YOU TELL OTHER HACKERS

02:20:07.899 --> 02:20:09.567
THAT THERE IS A BREACH THAT YOU

02:20:09.634 --> 02:20:13.538
COULD BE EXPOSING USERS DATA --

02:20:13.605 --> 02:20:15.340
TO OF MANY HACKERS AS OPPOSED TO

02:20:15.406 --> 02:20:17.108
THE ONE THAT THAT WAS ABLE TO

02:20:17.175 --> 02:20:19.043
GET AND SO IS THERE ANY SAFE

02:20:19.110 --> 02:20:21.045
GUARD WHERE MAYBE THE ATTORNEY

02:20:21.112 --> 02:20:24.616
GENERAL COULD SAY -- YES THIS IS

02:20:24.682 --> 02:20:25.950
THIS IS LEGITIMATE THEIR THEIR

02:20:26.017 --> 02:20:27.652
SYSTEM IS STILL WIDE OPEN AND

02:20:27.719 --> 02:20:28.520
THEY HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO PATCH

02:20:28.586 --> 02:20:32.557
IT I MEAN LIKE I SAID I WOULDN'T

02:20:32.624 --> 02:20:34.793
MIND THE FIFTEEN DAYS BUT BUT

02:20:34.859 --> 02:20:35.360
KEEPING.

02:20:35.426 --> 02:20:38.129
A VULNERABILITY OPEN IS IS TO BE

02:20:38.196 --> 02:20:39.297
A PROBLEM -- IT ABSOLUTELY

02:20:39.364 --> 02:20:41.132
CURRENT LAW -- ALLOWS FOR LAW

02:20:41.199 --> 02:20:42.066
ENFORCEMENT WHICH WOULD INCLUDE

02:20:42.133 --> 02:20:43.301
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OR ANY LAW

02:20:43.368 --> 02:20:45.303
ENFORCEMENT AGENCY THAT HAPPENS

02:20:45.370 --> 02:20:48.139
TO BE INVESTIGATING AT TO PERMIT

02:20:48.206 --> 02:20:49.808
THE COMPANY TO TO TELL THE

02:20:49.874 --> 02:20:51.109
COMPANY DID NOT NOTIFY --

02:20:51.176 --> 02:20:53.511
CONSUMERS AND THERE'S A COUPLE

02:20:53.578 --> 02:20:56.981
OF REASONS WHY -- ONE FORCE THAT

02:20:57.048 --> 02:20:57.415
WOULD NOT NOT WANT.

02:20:57.482 --> 02:20:58.516
CONSUMERS TO BE NOTIFIED YOUR

02:20:58.583 --> 02:21:00.018
CONCERN IS ONE OF THEM ANOTHER

02:21:00.084 --> 02:21:01.119
ONE IS SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY'RE

02:21:01.186 --> 02:21:01.986
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHO THE BAD

02:21:02.053 --> 02:21:03.955
GUY IS AND THEY DON'T WANT THE

02:21:04.022 --> 02:21:07.058
BAD GUY TO KNOW THAT THEY KNOW.

02:21:07.125 --> 02:21:10.161
SO SO CURRENT LAW -- TAKES CARE

02:21:10.228 --> 02:21:11.629
OF THAT PROBLEM SO AT THE END OF

02:21:11.696 --> 02:21:12.797
LIKE IF I CAN FIX YOU LOOK AT

02:21:12.864 --> 02:21:13.665
THE LANGUAGE IS ON PAGE THREE IF

02:21:13.731 --> 02:21:14.332
YOU HAVE IT IN FRONT OF YOU --

02:21:14.399 --> 02:21:16.701
IF YOU LOOK AT THE LINES

02:21:16.768 --> 02:21:17.335
FOURTEEN TO TWENTY WHERE IT SAYS

02:21:17.402 --> 02:21:18.536
THAT CAN CONSIST OF THE LEDGE TO

02:21:18.603 --> 02:21:19.637
THE GYM IT NEEDS OF LAW

02:21:19.704 --> 02:21:21.139
ENFORCEMENT AS PROVIDED IN

02:21:21.206 --> 02:21:23.007
SUBDIVISION AND THEN IT GOES ON

02:21:23.074 --> 02:21:24.943
SO THE I THINK WE TALKED A

02:21:25.009 --> 02:21:26.611
LITTLE BIT OUT IN THE HALLWAY --

02:21:26.678 --> 02:21:28.313
MAYBE THIS DOESN'T ADDRESS YOUR

02:21:28.379 --> 02:21:30.481
YOUR CONCERN AND I'D BE HAPPY TO

02:21:30.548 --> 02:21:31.082
WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE A TWO

02:21:31.149 --> 02:21:32.383
FOOT TO ADDRESS THAT BECAUSE WE

02:21:32.450 --> 02:21:33.785
CERTAINLY DON'T WANT IF THERE IS

02:21:33.852 --> 02:21:35.620
A SMALL BREACH TO YOUR POINT WE

02:21:35.687 --> 02:21:36.521
DON'T WANT THAT BREACH TO GET

02:21:36.588 --> 02:21:36.855
MUCH.

02:21:36.921 --> 02:21:38.489
MUCH LARGER AND TO CREATE MORE

02:21:38.556 --> 02:21:39.858
OF A LIABILITY THAN THAT THAN

02:21:39.924 --> 02:21:41.593
THERE ALREADY IS AT THE SAME

02:21:41.659 --> 02:21:42.961
TIME WE DON'T WANT THE COMPANIES

02:21:43.027 --> 02:21:45.997
TO HAVE SOME EXCUSE -- FOR NOT

02:21:46.064 --> 02:21:47.532
LETTING OF FOLKS KNOW THAT

02:21:47.599 --> 02:21:48.166
THERE'S BEEN A BIT BEEN A DATA

02:21:48.233 --> 02:21:50.001
BREACH AND SO WOULD BE OPEN TO

02:21:50.068 --> 02:21:51.469
THAT TO THAT CONVERSATION AT

02:21:51.536 --> 02:21:53.838
THAT'S AND AND I I ABSOLUTELY

02:21:53.905 --> 02:21:56.007
AGREE WE HAVE TO HOLD THESE

02:21:56.074 --> 02:21:57.108
COMPANIES ACCOUNTABLE I JUST.

02:21:57.175 --> 02:21:58.209
YOU JUST DON'T WANNA MAKE THE

02:21:58.276 --> 02:22:00.044
SITUATION WORSE SO IF IT'S TAKEN

02:22:00.111 --> 02:22:02.080
CARE OF BY THAT STATEMENT IS

02:22:02.146 --> 02:22:04.249
ABOUT LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THAT'S

02:22:04.315 --> 02:22:08.386
FINE OTHERWISE -- HOPEFULLY

02:22:08.453 --> 02:22:10.788
THAT'S SOMETHING YOU CAN WORK ON

02:22:10.855 --> 02:22:13.524
SURE.

02:22:13.591 --> 02:22:15.093
SO I AGREE WITH THE COMMENTS

02:22:15.159 --> 02:22:16.394
FROM MY COLLEAGUE THAT.

02:22:16.461 --> 02:22:17.228
WE WANT.

02:22:17.295 --> 02:22:17.762
THIS TO HAPPEN AS SOON AS

02:22:17.829 --> 02:22:18.930
POSSIBLE SEVENTY TWO HOURS

02:22:18.997 --> 02:22:21.833
FIFTEEN DAYS BUT IT MOST FORTY

02:22:21.900 --> 02:22:22.634
FIVE HER THAT'S HOW I READ THE

02:22:22.700 --> 02:22:25.036
LAW TO BE AS MISTER IS PROPOSING

02:22:25.103 --> 02:22:26.437
IT SAYS.

02:22:26.504 --> 02:22:27.272
THAT THE DISCLOSURE SHALL BE

02:22:27.338 --> 02:22:28.773
MADE IN THE MOST EXPEDIENT TIME

02:22:28.840 --> 02:22:30.375
POSSIBLE AND WITHOUT AND

02:22:30.441 --> 02:22:31.476
REASONABLE THE LAKE BUT IN NO

02:22:31.542 --> 02:22:34.045
CASE LONGER THAN FORTY FIVE DAYS

02:22:34.112 --> 02:22:35.747
OF COMPANY WERE TO BE FOUND. TO

02:22:35.813 --> 02:22:36.748
REFER TO BE POSSIBLE TO DISCLOSE

02:22:36.814 --> 02:22:38.182
WITHIN SEVENTY TWO HOURS OR

02:22:38.249 --> 02:22:38.783
FIFTEEN DAYS THEY WOULD BE IN

02:22:38.850 --> 02:22:41.386
VIOLATION OF THIS LAWS I READ IT.

02:22:41.452 --> 02:22:42.553
BUT AT NO FORTY FIVE AN HOUR

02:22:42.620 --> 02:22:43.955
OUTSIDE.

02:22:44.022 --> 02:22:47.792
SO I GUESS I DON'T UNDERSTAND

02:22:47.859 --> 02:22:49.727
YOUR OPPOSITION.

02:22:49.794 --> 02:22:50.762
HAVING LITIGATE THESE CASES THE

02:22:50.828 --> 02:22:51.930
THE FORTY FIVE DAY WHATEVER THE

02:22:51.996 --> 02:22:52.330
TIME WHEN IT IS.

02:22:52.397 --> 02:22:53.231

02:22:56.434 --> 02:22:56.968
STATUTES.

02:22:57.035 --> 02:22:58.503
THAT BECOMES THE NORM THAT'S

02:22:58.569 --> 02:23:00.004
WHAT COMPANIES SHOULD FOR AND

02:23:00.071 --> 02:23:01.005
THERE'S NEVER REALLY ANY

02:23:01.072 --> 02:23:03.374
INCENTIVE TO IMPROVE THAT TIME

02:23:03.441 --> 02:23:04.475
AND THEN IT BECOMES SOMETHING

02:23:04.542 --> 02:23:05.777
THAT HAS TO BE LITIGATED ABOUT

02:23:05.843 --> 02:23:07.145
WHETHER OR NOT.

02:23:07.211 --> 02:23:09.113
A COMPANY SHOULD HAVE --

02:23:09.180 --> 02:23:09.981
COMPLIED WITH A NOTE OF CARE

02:23:10.048 --> 02:23:12.150
PROVIDED NOTIFICATION EASE EVEN

02:23:12.216 --> 02:23:12.817
EARLIER.

02:23:12.884 --> 02:23:14.385
SO.

02:23:14.452 --> 02:23:17.388
THE HAVING AN OUTSIDE DATE.

02:23:17.455 --> 02:23:20.325
GET IT IS A DOUBLE EDGED SWORD

02:23:20.391 --> 02:23:21.326
BECAUSE IT ENDS UP AS SOON AS

02:23:21.392 --> 02:23:23.094
CALIFORNIA SAYS FORTY FIVE DAYS.

02:23:23.161 --> 02:23:25.396
IT'S FORTY FIVE DAYS AND IT'S

02:23:25.463 --> 02:23:27.265
ONLY GOING TO BE REALLY IN THE

02:23:27.332 --> 02:23:29.634
EXCEPTION THAT IT'S EVER GONNA

02:23:29.701 --> 02:23:30.668
BE SHORTER THAN THAT.

02:23:30.735 --> 02:23:32.937
IN THERE AS TECHNOLOGY ADVANCES

02:23:33.004 --> 02:23:34.806

ORDERS OF THE COURT SUBPOENAS.

02:37:25.369 --> 02:37:26.937

02:37:29.807 --> 02:37:31.208
LAW ENFORCEMENT DOES NOT HAVE

AVAILABLE TO IT AT THE

02:37:32.409 --> 02:37:34.645
INVESTIGATION STAGE A SUBPOENA

02:37:34.711 --> 02:37:35.412
IT'S NOT.

02:37:35.479 --> 02:37:36.814
SOMETHING IT'S NOT A TOOL THAT

02:37:36.880 --> 02:37:38.315
THEY HAVE IN THEIR TOOL BOX.

02:37:38.382 --> 02:37:40.117

02:37:59.903 --> 02:38:02.840
REPEATED WHAT THE BILL DOES HAVE

02:38:02.906 --> 02:38:03.674
SOME.

02:38:03.740 --> 02:38:04.575
I I DON'T I HAVEN'T HEARD -- A

02:38:04.641 --> 02:38:05.809
JUSTIFICATION FOR WHY THIS

02:38:05.876 --> 02:38:06.910
IMPORTANT DISTINCTION SHOULD NOW

02:38:06.977 --> 02:38:11.381
BE TRAVERSED FOR THE FIRST TIME.

02:38:11.448 --> 02:38:12.883
IT IN IN MANY CASES COVERED BY

02:38:12.950 --> 02:38:14.318
THE BILL CONSENT WOULD BE

02:38:14.384 --> 02:38:15.719
ATTAINABLE OBVIOUSLY WHEN THE

GIVE CONSENT.

02:38:19.556 --> 02:38:21.258
THEN THAT MIGHT BE ONE LIMITED

02:38:21.325 --> 02:38:22.759
CIRCUMSTANCE BUT THAT'S NOT THE

02:38:22.826 --> 02:38:24.628
ONLY CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH TO BUILD

02:38:24.695 --> 02:38:27.664
PLIES.

02:38:27.731 --> 02:38:28.265
AND YOU VIEW THIS IS SORT OF A

02:38:28.332 --> 02:38:29.766

02:38:52.055 --> 02:38:52.456
CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE.

02:38:52.522 --> 02:38:54.191
CERTAIN INFORMATION IS NOT

02:38:54.258 --> 02:38:55.459
ALWAYS AVAILABLE.

02:38:55.525 --> 02:38:57.494
ON FOR SPENT IN CERTAIN

02:38:57.561 --> 02:38:59.763
CIRCUMSTANCES -- WHAT WE'RE

02:38:59.830 --> 02:39:01.131
TALKING ABOUT HERE IS A FAIRLY

02:39:01.198 --> 02:39:05.202
NARROW SITUATION IT IT SEEMS --

02:39:05.269 --> 02:39:09.039
BUT IT IS NOT -- LIKELY TO BE

02:39:09.106 --> 02:39:12.109
ONE THAT ARISES OFTEN -- AND AND

02:39:12.175 --> 02:39:13.410
NOT ONE THAT WE THINK IT'S

02:39:13.477 --> 02:39:15.112
SUFFICIENT TO JUSTIFY DEPARTING

02:39:15.178 --> 02:39:17.314
FROM OUR LONG STANDING

02:39:17.381 --> 02:39:19.116
CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES.

02:39:19.182 --> 02:39:21.451
IN THE EVENT THAT WE RUN INTO A

02:39:21.518 --> 02:39:22.452
SITUATION WHERE SOMEBODY IS A

02:39:22.519 --> 02:39:23.854
SEES TO IT WOULD SEEM THAT THE

02:39:23.921 --> 02:39:25.389
LAW IS LACKING IN TERMS OF HOW

02:39:25.455 --> 02:39:26.623
YOU CAN OBTAIN THIS INFORMATION

02:39:26.690 --> 02:39:28.191
IT COULD HELP YOU DETERMINE.

02:39:28.258 --> 02:39:30.727
THE THE THE CIRCUMSTANCES

02:39:30.794 --> 02:39:31.828
SURROUNDING THE ACCIDENT OF

02:39:31.895 --> 02:39:32.863
CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING IT

02:39:32.930 --> 02:39:34.064
WHATEVER THE SITUATION IS THAT

02:39:34.131 --> 02:39:36.066
YOU COULD MAYBE LEARN FROM BEING

02:39:36.133 --> 02:39:37.968
ABLE TO HAVE ACCESS TO THIS TYPE

02:39:38.035 --> 02:39:39.202
OF INFORMATION -- I MAY NOT

02:39:39.269 --> 02:39:40.804
NECESSARILY THOROUGHLY DISAGREE

OPENING THIS PER PROCESS UP BUT

02:39:47.511 --> 02:39:48.845
IT SEEMS LIKE SEEMS TO ME THAT

02:39:48.912 --> 02:39:50.347
THERE COULD BE A GAP.

02:39:50.414 --> 02:39:52.482
IN GETTING GAINING ACCESS TO

02:39:52.549 --> 02:39:54.451
THIS TYPE OF INFORMATION --

02:39:54.518 --> 02:39:55.352
ESPECIALLY IN THE EVENT THAT

02:39:55.419 --> 02:39:57.721
SOMEBODY HAS BEEN -- DECEASED SO

02:39:57.788 --> 02:39:58.822

WHICH WAS.

02:40:15.672 --> 02:40:16.907
WILL GIVES ME COMFORT IS THE

02:40:16.974 --> 02:40:18.809

ALTHOUGH I MY UNDERSTANDING OF

02:40:21.044 --> 02:40:22.279
THIS WOULD BE THAT THE STANDARD

02:40:22.346 --> 02:40:24.014
WOULD BE DIFFERENT. FOR THESE

SERIOUS CRIMES.

02:41:13.497 --> 02:41:14.531
THAT'S THE SITUATION IN WHICH WE

02:41:14.598 --> 02:41:17.934
AUTHORIZE SEARCH WARRANTS.

02:41:18.001 --> 02:41:18.769
GOT IT BUT THE COURT WOULD STILL

02:41:18.835 --> 02:41:20.203
HAVE TO DO THAT DETERMINATION TO

02:41:20.270 --> 02:41:22.072
BALANCE THE PRIVACY INTEREST OF

02:41:22.139 --> 02:41:23.340
THE INDIVIDUAL FOR WHOM THIS

02:41:23.407 --> 02:41:25.075
DATA WAS BEING.

02:41:25.142 --> 02:41:27.310
SOUGHT AND THE NEED FOR THE DATA

WARRANTS. TO THE WHOLE LITANY OF

02:41:33.617 --> 02:41:37.387
OTHER POTENTIAL LOW LEVEL

02:41:37.454 --> 02:41:40.290
INFRACTIONS.

02:41:40.357 --> 02:41:42.592
LOOK AT WHERE THEY DID NOT EXIST

02:41:42.659 --> 02:41:45.796
OKAY I UNDERSTAND THANK YOU.

02:41:45.862 --> 02:41:47.531
A MISTER GALLAGHER -- JUST TO

02:41:47.597 --> 02:41:48.165
QUIT BUT IT WOULD STILL HAVE TO

02:41:48.231 --> 02:41:49.766
INVOLVE A SITUATION WHERE.

02:41:49.833 --> 02:41:51.635
DEATH OR SERIOUS BODILY INJURY

02:41:51.701 --> 02:41:53.003
HAD OCCURRED CORRECT THAT'S

02:41:53.070 --> 02:41:54.938
CORRECT THAT'S THE WAY WE'VE

02:41:55.005 --> 02:41:57.607
NARROWLY TERREL TAYLOR THE BILL

02:41:57.674 --> 02:42:04.781
ONLY IN THOSE ACCIDENTS.

WOULD JUST BE BACK ON NOW THAT --

02:42:08.718 --> 02:42:11.088
OB GRANTED THERE IS STILL THE

02:42:11.154 --> 02:42:12.989
BUFFER OF REQUIRING A SEARCH

02:42:13.056 --> 02:42:13.256
WARRANT.

02:42:13.323 --> 02:42:15.392
I THINK THAT THE DEFINITION FOR

02:42:15.459 --> 02:42:18.361
OF PUBLIC OFFENDS AND ALSO THE

02:42:18.428 --> 02:42:21.731
SERIES -- BODY INJURY -- A SOLO

02:42:21.798 --> 02:42:24.935
NEBULOUS LET ME JUST POINT OUT.

02:42:25.001 --> 02:42:26.103
TO WHERE I STAND ON IT.

02:42:26.169 --> 02:42:27.471
UP I THINK WHEN IT COMES TO

02:42:27.537 --> 02:42:28.772
PUBLIC OFFENSE I THINK IT'S BEEN

02:42:28.839 --> 02:42:34.411
ARTICULATED -- BY THE DA AND OB.

02:42:34.478 --> 02:42:34.945
TO INCLUDE INFRACTIONS FOR

02:42:35.011 --> 02:42:36.680
EXAMPLE.

02:42:36.746 --> 02:42:38.615
NOW AS FAR AS THE TERM SERIOUS

02:42:38.682 --> 02:42:39.716
BODILY INJURY.

02:42:39.783 --> 02:42:41.451
THE WAY THAT I READ IT IS THAT

02:42:41.518 --> 02:42:43.053
IS IT SAYS.

02:42:43.120 --> 02:42:44.187
ON THEY DEFINE CERES BODILY

02:42:44.254 --> 02:42:46.022
INJURY TO MEAN A SERIOUS

02:42:46.089 --> 02:42:48.024
IMPAIRMENT OF PHYSICAL CONDITION

02:42:48.091 --> 02:42:50.227
INCLUDING BUT NOT.

02:42:50.293 --> 02:42:52.262
LIMITED TO THE FOLLOWING. ONE

02:42:52.329 --> 02:42:54.898
LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS CONCUSSION

02:42:54.965 --> 02:42:55.765
BONE FRACTURE.

02:42:55.832 --> 02:42:57.000
AND THAT'S THE ONE THAT I'M

02:42:57.067 --> 02:42:59.269
CONCERNED ABOUT BECAUSE I WHEN I

02:42:59.336 --> 02:43:00.704
WAS IN PRACTICE I DID A FEW

02:43:00.770 --> 02:43:01.905
FENDER BENDER CASES AND ALL.

02:43:01.972 --> 02:43:05.542
IN MANY OF THOSE INSTANCES OF

02:43:05.609 --> 02:43:07.244
PEOPLE HAD BILL FACTOR.

02:43:07.310 --> 02:43:09.513
AND DOT AND THEY WERE IN FASHION

02:43:09.579 --> 02:43:13.450
CASES SO WITH THIS NEW LAW.

02:43:13.517 --> 02:43:17.320
THERE WERE TALKING ABOUT --

02:43:17.387 --> 02:43:17.988
SOMEBODY THE GOVERNMENT IN FACT

02:43:18.054 --> 02:43:19.990
TO HAVING THE ABILITY.

02:43:20.056 --> 02:43:22.492
TO GET POTENTIALLY GET THE BLACK

02:43:22.559 --> 02:43:23.793
BOX OF THAT VEHICLE.

02:43:23.860 --> 02:43:26.196
EVEN IF THE INJURY IS SIMPLY A

02:43:26.263 --> 02:43:27.731
BONE FRACTURE.

02:43:27.797 --> 02:43:29.232
SO WHICH IS AN INFRACTION.

02:43:29.299 --> 02:43:32.068
SO THAT'S FOR MY CONCERN IS OUR

02:43:32.135 --> 02:43:34.838
NOW.

02:43:34.905 --> 02:43:37.541
DE GRANTED AGAIN YOU KNOW DO YOU

02:43:37.607 --> 02:43:38.909
STILL HAVE THAT BUFFER BEING

02:43:38.975 --> 02:43:39.509
THAT THAT SEARCH WARRANT YOU

02:43:39.576 --> 02:43:40.143
KNOW THE JUDGE WOULD STILL HAVE

02:43:40.210 --> 02:43:41.511
TO APPROVE IT AND ALL THAT.

02:43:41.578 --> 02:43:44.181
BUT IT DOES OPEN UP SOME SOME --

02:43:44.247 --> 02:43:46.183
SOME DOOR WHICH IS A WHICH

02:43:46.249 --> 02:43:47.951
DEVIATES FROM WHAT CURRENT LAW

02:43:48.018 --> 02:43:50.453
SAYS WHICH IS CAL UP ON OUR END

02:43:50.520 --> 02:43:51.988
AS FAR AND THE DA ALSO MISSION

02:43:52.055 --> 02:43:54.391
ABOUT THE THE PENAL CODE

02:43:54.457 --> 02:43:54.991
FOURTEEN TWENTY FOUR A BELIEF

02:43:55.058 --> 02:43:56.593
THAT PERTAINS ONLY.

02:43:56.660 --> 02:43:57.961
TO ON YOU KNOW BUT NON

02:43:58.028 --> 02:43:59.663
ELECTRONIC DEVICES BUT WE'RE

02:43:59.729 --> 02:44:00.931
TALKING ABOUT YOU KNOW SMART

02:44:00.997 --> 02:44:02.832
PHONES AND AND AND AND AND

02:44:02.899 --> 02:44:04.201
YOU'RE TRYING TO DEVICES AND THE

02:44:04.267 --> 02:44:05.702
LIKE IN THIS PARTICULAR

02:44:05.769 --> 02:44:06.603
SITUATION.

02:44:06.670 --> 02:44:09.072
SO SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE

02:44:09.139 --> 02:44:10.774
ISSUES THAT I SO HAVE.

02:44:10.840 --> 02:44:13.777
IT'S IT'S A IT'S A FINE ON ARMED.

02:44:13.843 --> 02:44:15.312
THE DIFFERENCE -- BUT YET AYE

02:44:15.378 --> 02:44:16.012
AYE YEAH I DO APPRECIATE THE

02:44:16.079 --> 02:44:18.014
FACT THAT YOU YOU TRY TO LIMIT

02:44:18.081 --> 02:44:19.816
THE BILL TO A VERY.

02:44:19.883 --> 02:44:21.718
VERY PARTICULAR SITUATION --

02:44:21.785 --> 02:44:23.520
SITUATIONS BUT BUT YET I I'M

02:44:23.587 --> 02:44:24.988
STILL NOT VERY COMFORTABLE WITH

02:44:25.055 --> 02:44:26.156
THE WITH THE FOOTBALL FRACTURE

02:44:26.223 --> 02:44:28.225
SITUATION WHICH WILL CALL FOR

02:44:28.291 --> 02:44:30.126
THE BLAK BOX TO BE. TO BE

02:44:30.193 --> 02:44:33.663
HANDED OVER OF FOR EXAMPLE -- SO

02:44:33.730 --> 02:44:39.636
IF YOU HAVE AN ANSWER I I'D LOVE

02:44:39.703 --> 02:44:40.971
TO HEAR SO. TO BE CLEAR THE

02:44:41.037 --> 02:44:41.805
DEFINITION OF SERIOUS BODILY

02:44:41.871 --> 02:44:42.339
INJURY THAT YOU QUOTED.

02:44:42.405 --> 02:44:44.140
IS NOT FROM THIS BILL WE JUST

02:44:44.207 --> 02:44:45.809
REFERENCED THE SECTION OF STATE

02:44:45.875 --> 02:44:46.409
CO THE TO FIND SERIOUS BODILY

02:44:46.476 --> 02:44:48.345
INJURY BECAUSE WE WERE TRYING

02:44:48.411 --> 02:44:49.346
NOT TO REINVENT THE WHEEL.

02:44:49.412 --> 02:44:50.914
THAT THAT'S THE REASON WHY IT'S

02:44:50.981 --> 02:44:53.283
TO FIND THE WAY IT IS -- BUT SO

02:44:53.350 --> 02:44:54.784
WE HAD TO DRAW THE LINE

02:44:54.851 --> 02:44:56.386
SOMEWHERE AND THEN DO YOU KNOW

02:44:56.453 --> 02:44:57.520
THE DEFINITION OF SERIOUS BODILY

02:44:57.587 --> 02:44:58.154
INJURY ELSEWHERE IN STATE CODE

02:44:58.221 --> 02:44:58.989
IS.

02:44:59.055 --> 02:45:00.290
IS WHERE WE CHOSE TO DO IT BUT

02:45:00.357 --> 02:45:01.691
I'M OPEN TO ANY SUGGESTIONS

02:45:01.758 --> 02:45:04.227
ABOUT HOW TO FURTHER NARROW THE

02:45:04.294 --> 02:45:05.262
FOCUS OF THE BILL.

02:45:05.328 --> 02:45:06.263
SO THAT WE ACCOMPLISH WHAT WE'RE

02:45:06.329 --> 02:45:07.197
TRYING TO DO HERE WITHOUT

02:45:07.264 --> 02:45:08.765
JEOPARDIZING PEOPLE'S PUBLIC

02:45:08.832 --> 02:45:10.533
SAFETY AND I THINK I'VE

02:45:10.600 --> 02:45:11.735
DEMONSTRATED A WILLINGNESS AS WE

02:45:11.801 --> 02:45:12.602
MOVE TO THE PROCESS HERE. TO TO

02:45:12.669 --> 02:45:14.004
REALLY BEND OVER BACKWARDS TO

02:45:14.070 --> 02:45:14.971

COMFORTABLE SO WOULD YOU LIKE TO

02:45:28.118 --> 02:45:28.952
CLOSE YES BUT WE AS I SAID WE

02:45:29.019 --> 02:45:29.853
TRIED VERY HARD TO STRIKE AN

02:45:29.919 --> 02:45:31.054

THE WIRELESS INDUSTRY.

02:50:33.823 --> 02:50:35.291
INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION WE HAVE

02:50:35.358 --> 02:50:37.293
BEEN WORKING WITH MR WAY AND AND

02:50:37.360 --> 02:50:38.828
HAD OUR SOME OF OUR COMPANY'S

02:50:38.895 --> 02:50:40.663
PRIVACY EXPERTS ON THE PHONE

02:50:40.730 --> 02:50:41.698
WITH THEIR STAFF THE OTHER DAY.

02:50:41.764 --> 02:50:43.666
TO TRY TO WORK THROUGH SOME OF

02:50:43.733 --> 02:50:45.435
THE ISSUES AND I THINK THE THE

02:50:45.501 --> 02:50:46.836
ANALYSIS DOES POINT OUT THAT

02:50:46.903 --> 02:50:48.438
THERE IS SOME CONFUSION AN

02:50:48.504 --> 02:50:50.173
OVERLAP WITH THE C. C. P. A.

02:50:50.239 --> 02:50:51.207
WITH THE FEDERAL RULES AND THE

02:50:51.274 --> 02:50:52.375
LIKES IS WE'RE TRYING.

02:50:52.442 --> 02:50:54.143
TO SORT SOME OF THAT OUT BUT I

02:50:54.210 --> 02:50:55.545
THOUGHT IT IMPORTANT TO MAYBE

02:50:55.612 --> 02:50:59.716
SET THE CONTEXT FOR HOW.

02:50:59.782 --> 02:51:03.119
THIS HAPPENED -- THE DATA WAS

02:51:03.186 --> 02:51:04.787
PROVIDED TO A THIRD PARTY

02:51:04.854 --> 02:51:06.489
AGGREGATOR BY EACH OF THE

02:51:06.556 --> 02:51:09.425
CARRIERS. TO TO DO THINGS LIKE

02:51:09.492 --> 02:51:10.793
PROVIDE DATA FOR ROADSIDE

02:51:10.860 --> 02:51:12.795
ASSISTANCE IN LIFE ALERT --

02:51:12.862 --> 02:51:16.132
CHECK VERIFICATION -- THE THINGS

02:51:16.199 --> 02:51:17.567
THAT HELP CUSTOMERS IN THE

02:51:17.634 --> 02:51:19.102
DECIDED TO USE THE AGGREGATOR

02:51:19.168 --> 02:51:20.303
BECAUSE IT WAS EASY TO WORK

02:51:20.370 --> 02:51:22.672
THROUGH ONE ENTITY RATHER THAN

02:51:22.739 --> 02:51:23.640
HAVE EACH CARRIER DO THAT.

02:51:23.706 --> 02:51:26.009
OF THE INFORMATION UNFORTUNATELY

02:51:26.075 --> 02:51:27.410
WAS TAKEN BY THAT AGGREGATOR AND

02:51:27.477 --> 02:51:29.379
USE FOR PURPOSES THAT THE

02:51:29.445 --> 02:51:31.447
CARRIERS HAD NOT INTENDED --

02:51:31.514 --> 02:51:32.815
THAT PRACTICE WAS STOPPED

02:51:32.882 --> 02:51:36.653
PERHAPS NOT QUICKLY ENOUGH --

02:51:36.719 --> 02:51:37.420
FOR FOR FOR SOME BUT IT HAS

02:51:37.487 --> 02:51:40.556
STOPPED -- IN IT IT ALSO HAS

02:51:40.623 --> 02:51:42.358
KIND OF RAISED A COUPLE OF A

02:51:42.425 --> 02:51:45.695
POTENTIAL ISSUES WITH SUPPORTING.

02:51:45.762 --> 02:51:47.463
OF THOSE.

02:51:47.530 --> 02:51:49.699
SERVICES -- ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE

02:51:49.766 --> 02:51:52.201
IN LIFE ALERT I MEAN BASED UPON.

02:51:52.268 --> 02:51:53.803
THE WAY THE BILL IS WRITTEN IT'S

02:51:53.870 --> 02:51:56.606
CONCEIVABLE THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE

02:51:56.673 --> 02:51:58.241
TO GO AND GET WRITTEN CONSENT TO

02:51:58.307 --> 02:51:59.442
GET A TOW TRUCK I DON'T THINK

02:51:59.509 --> 02:52:01.644
THAT'S WHAT IT'S INTENDED.

02:52:01.711 --> 02:52:04.247
BUT WITH THE WAY THAT THE BILL

02:52:04.313 --> 02:52:06.182
HAS IS CRAFTED -- WE'RE

02:52:06.249 --> 02:52:07.750
CONCERNED THAT THAT THE ABILITY

02:52:07.817 --> 02:52:10.119
TO ACCESS THAT INFORMATION IS --

02:52:10.186 --> 02:52:13.189
HIS HIS PERHAPS -- THREATENED --

02:52:13.256 --> 02:52:15.091
WE HAVE HAD SOME CONVERSATIONS

02:52:15.158 --> 02:52:16.025
THAT THE FOOD AND AND IF THERE

02:52:16.092 --> 02:52:17.260
WAS AN EARLIER BILL WE TALKED

02:52:17.326 --> 02:52:18.594
ABOUT THE SAME THING WERE

02:52:18.661 --> 02:52:19.862
WRITTEN CONSENT.

02:52:19.929 --> 02:52:22.665
IS PROBABLY NOT A STANDARD THAT

02:52:22.732 --> 02:52:24.200
THAT IS APPROPRIATE IN THIS

02:52:24.267 --> 02:52:25.401
INSTANCE AND AND THERE OUGHT TO

02:52:25.468 --> 02:52:27.036
BE A IT OUGHT TO BE A BROADER

02:52:27.103 --> 02:52:30.239
WAY TO DEAL WITH THAT IF IN FACT --

02:52:30.306 --> 02:52:30.973
WE'RE GONNA MOVE FORWARD.

02:52:31.040 --> 02:52:32.108
MOVE FORWARD LIKE THIS.

02:52:32.175 --> 02:52:34.444
BUT AGAIN THIS IS A TECHNOLOGY

02:52:34.510 --> 02:52:36.379
SPECIFIC BILL.

02:52:36.446 --> 02:52:38.981
IT PROVIDES A THE REQUIREMENT OF

02:52:39.048 --> 02:52:40.883
OF NOW WRITTEN CONSENT OR

02:52:40.950 --> 02:52:44.120

02:52:45.855 --> 02:52:47.356
TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROVIDERS --

02:52:47.423 --> 02:52:50.293
BUT BUT IT'S ANY KIND OF GEO

02:52:50.359 --> 02:52:52.628
LOCATION -- IT'S NOT PRECISE

02:52:52.695 --> 02:52:54.197
YOUR LOCATION NECESSARILY COULD

02:52:54.263 --> 02:52:56.032
BE STATED COULD BE CITY IT COULD

02:52:56.099 --> 02:52:58.434
BE STUFF THAT'S HARMLESS NOT --

02:52:58.501 --> 02:52:59.435
CONNECT DOUBLE REASONABLY

02:52:59.502 --> 02:53:02.371
LIKABLE TO PERSONAL INFORMATION --

02:53:02.438 --> 02:53:03.539
AND SUCH THAT I THINK RULE

02:53:03.606 --> 02:53:05.842
RAISES SOME CONCERNS ABOUT HOW

02:53:05.908 --> 02:53:06.976
OF YOU KNOW WORKING WITH THE

02:53:07.043 --> 02:53:09.545
PHILLY IT'S ABOUT.

02:53:09.612 --> 02:53:11.047

IRWIN AND WE DISAGREE ON THIS

02:53:18.955 --> 02:53:22.759
POINT -- BUT THERE ARE MEN IN

02:53:22.825 --> 02:53:28.865
THE ANALYSIS DOES POINT OUT --

02:53:28.931 --> 02:53:31.501
THAT -- THAT THIS DOES NOT APPLY

02:53:31.567 --> 02:53:32.368
TO OTHER BUSINESSES THAT MAKE

02:53:32.435 --> 02:53:33.469
APPLICATIONS AVAILABLE ON A

02:53:33.536 --> 02:53:34.137

02:53:36.506 --> 02:53:38.541
SOMETIMES GPS DATA -- THAT'S FAR

02:53:38.608 --> 02:53:40.643
MORE ACCURATE THAN THE THAN THAN

02:53:40.710 --> 02:53:44.413
THE WIRELESS THE CELL SITE DATA --

02:53:44.480 --> 02:53:46.616
WE DO GET CRITICIZED SOMETIMES

02:53:46.682 --> 02:53:48.651
IN THE NINE ONE ONE ERR ARENA

02:53:48.718 --> 02:53:50.052
FOR THE LOCATION NOT BEING

02:53:50.119 --> 02:53:53.723
PRECISE ENOUGH -- YET IRONICALLY --

02:53:53.790 --> 02:53:56.192
WE NOW ARE THE ONLY ONES TO BE

02:53:56.259 --> 02:53:58.060

02:55:13.903 --> 02:55:15.872
OPPOSITION AND IT MIGHT JUST BE

02:55:15.938 --> 02:55:17.573
A LIMITATION OF MY UNDERSTANDING

02:55:17.640 --> 02:55:18.975
OF FEDERAL LAW BUT THIS FEDERAL

02:55:19.041 --> 02:55:20.042
LAW.

ANONYMIZED DATA OF THIS TYPE.

02:55:25.815 --> 02:55:27.283
I I DON'T THINK I THINK THIS IS

02:55:27.350 --> 02:55:29.785
ANONYMIZED DATA BUT BUT IT WAS

02:55:29.852 --> 02:55:31.420
ALSO PROVIDED WITH CONSENT SO

02:55:31.487 --> 02:55:34.957
THAT THE SITUATION THAT WE ARE --

02:55:35.024 --> 02:55:36.559
THE I. DESCRIBED AND I'VE I

02:55:36.626 --> 02:55:38.227
NEGLECTED TO SAY THAT THE

02:55:38.294 --> 02:55:39.295
INFORMATION THAT WAS PROVIDED TO

02:55:39.362 --> 02:55:43.432
THE AGGREGATOR WAS -- WITH THE

02:55:43.499 --> 02:55:47.670
CONSENT. FOR THE ABILITY -- TO

02:55:47.737 --> 02:55:49.805
TO PURSUE THE SERVICES THAT --

02:55:49.872 --> 02:55:51.641
THAT WAS PROVIDED FOR OKAY SO

02:55:51.707 --> 02:55:53.576
WAS THE DATA THAT WAS PROVIDED

02:55:53.643 --> 02:55:55.478
TO THE AGGREGATOR WAS AT

02:55:55.544 --> 02:55:57.713
ANONYMIZED OR NON ANONYMIZED

02:55:57.780 --> 02:56:00.283
BILLY WAS ANONYMIZED OKAY BUT

BUT ALSO WITH WITH CONSENT.

02:56:01.484 --> 02:56:02.251
OKAY SO

02:56:02.318 --> 02:56:04.787
MY QUESTION IS IF THE DATA WAS

02:56:04.854 --> 02:56:06.889
ANONYMIZED A MEANS TO SO SOME OF

02:56:06.956 --> 02:56:10.259
THE PROBLEM CASES THAT HAVE BEEN --

02:56:10.326 --> 02:56:11.827
WOULD THAT HAVE LED TO THIS BILL

02:56:11.894 --> 02:56:15.464
ARE CASES WHERE -- PEOPLE HAD --

02:56:15.531 --> 02:56:16.265
A BOUNTY HUNTER.

02:56:16.332 --> 02:56:17.800
YOU KNOW IT ACQUIRED THE DATA

02:56:17.867 --> 02:56:19.001
FOR EXAMPLE IS ONE SO HOW WOULD

02:56:19.068 --> 02:56:21.137
THAT HOW WOULD ANONYMIZE DATA BE

02:56:21.203 --> 02:56:22.038
OF ANY USE.

02:56:22.104 --> 02:56:23.739
IN THEIR CATECHISM UNDERSTAND

02:56:23.806 --> 02:56:25.408
HOW HOW IT COULD HAVE BEEN

02:56:25.474 --> 02:56:27.777
ANONYMIZED IN YEAH AND STILL BIT

02:56:27.843 --> 02:56:28.010
OF USE.

02:56:28.077 --> 02:56:29.078
I BELIEVE THAT THERE WAS A

02:56:29.145 --> 02:56:31.280
COMBINATION OF THE DATA AND THEN

02:56:31.347 --> 02:56:32.581
THE USE OF APPS.

02:56:32.648 --> 02:56:34.216
IN ADDITION TO SOME OF THE DATA

02:56:34.283 --> 02:56:38.287
WHICH LED -- TO MORE SPECIFIC

02:56:38.354 --> 02:56:40.790
ABILITY -- TO TO IDENTIFY THE

WAS AND AGAIN.

02:56:46.062 --> 02:56:47.630

02:56:47.697 --> 02:56:48.931
THAT DATA BE PROVIDED TO A

02:56:48.998 --> 02:56:49.932
BOUNTY HUNTER BUT I DON'T

02:56:49.999 --> 02:56:51.467
BELIEVE IT WAS PERSONALLY

02:56:51.534 --> 02:56:53.102
IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION.

02:56:53.169 --> 02:56:53.736
OKAY WELL I MEAN I JUST THINK

02:56:53.803 --> 02:56:55.471
THAT THE THAT PARTICULAR

02:56:55.538 --> 02:56:57.506
CIRCUMSTANCES AN ILLUSTRATION OF

02:56:57.573 --> 02:56:58.374
WHY.

02:56:58.441 --> 02:57:00.209
THIS TYPE OF DATA IS SO

02:57:00.276 --> 02:57:00.910
SENSITIVE.

02:57:00.977 --> 02:57:02.244
THERE IS IT SOMEONE CAN TAKE IT

02:57:02.311 --> 02:57:03.446
AND USE IT IN WAYS THAT WE

02:57:03.512 --> 02:57:04.547
DIDN'T IN TOWN MAYBE IN

02:57:04.613 --> 02:57:05.781

AGREED AND IT'S AGAIN IT'S NOT

02:57:14.957 --> 02:57:16.359

02:59:22.051 --> 02:59:24.220
AND WOOD OVER LOVE -- OVERLAP

02:59:24.286 --> 02:59:25.654
WITH THIS BILL AS IT DOES WITH

02:59:25.721 --> 02:59:30.493
LAND MINES ALSO AND AND SO -- WE

02:59:30.559 --> 02:59:31.427
THINK THAT WE'VE GONE THROUGH

02:59:31.494 --> 02:59:32.628
THE DIFFERENCE IN OURS BUT I

02:59:32.695 --> 02:59:34.296
CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND.

02:59:34.363 --> 02:59:35.965
THAT -- WITH YOU BEING THE

02:59:36.031 --> 02:59:37.933
AUTHOR OF CCPA THAT YOU WANT TO

02:59:38.000 --> 02:59:38.767
BE A LITTLE BIT MORE CAUTIOUS

02:59:38.834 --> 02:59:41.437
BUT AGAIN THIS IS BASED ON YOU

02:59:41.504 --> 02:59:43.005
KNOW BECAUSE I THINK THINGS WERE

02:59:43.072 --> 02:59:43.906
A LITTLE.

02:59:43.973 --> 02:59:45.774
OF METAL THIS IS BASED ON A

02:59:45.841 --> 02:59:48.611
SITUATION WHERE -- THE REAL TIME

02:59:48.677 --> 02:59:53.082
INFORMATION WAS AVAILABLE -- TO

02:59:53.149 --> 02:59:55.684
A TWO BOUNTY HUNTERS AND ANYBODY

02:59:55.751 --> 02:59:57.186
ELSE THAT WANTED TO FOLLOW

02:59:57.253 --> 02:59:58.821
SOMEBODY THIS IS IT AND WILL BE

02:59:58.888 --> 03:00:00.589
REALLY SPECIFIC THIS IS -- CELL

03:00:00.656 --> 03:00:02.791
PHONE TOWER TRIANGULATION THIS

03:00:02.858 --> 03:00:04.293
IS NOT LOCATION DATA FROM THE

03:00:04.360 --> 03:00:05.728
APPS.

03:00:05.794 --> 03:00:08.998
AND THIS IS ALREADY AGAINST OF

03:00:09.064 --> 03:00:10.633
FEDERAL LAW.

03:00:10.699 --> 03:00:12.468
BUT THE FCC IS NOT ENFORCING IT

03:00:12.535 --> 03:00:13.335
SO WE THOUGHT IT WAS VERY

03:00:13.402 --> 03:00:15.771
IMPORTANT TO GET IT TO BE BUT

03:00:15.838 --> 03:00:18.274
PART OF CPUC.

03:00:18.340 --> 03:00:20.109
CODE TO MAKE SURE THAT SAID THAT

03:00:20.176 --> 03:00:21.477
WE HAD FORCES AND THE REASON

03:00:21.544 --> 03:00:24.180
THAT IT IT DOES NOT APPLY. TO

03:00:26.982 --> 03:00:29.018

03:00:29.084 --> 03:00:30.586
SEEN THIS.

03:00:30.653 --> 03:00:32.421
BEHAVIOR FRANKLY FROM THEM THIS

03:00:32.488 --> 03:00:34.557
IS THE SPECIFICALLY THE CELL

03:00:34.623 --> 03:00:35.257
PHONE COMPANIES THAT WERE

03:00:35.324 --> 03:00:36.926

<u>&lt;c.magenta&gt;R GEL IN THAT IS THE YOU'VE GOT&lt;/c&gt;</u>

03:03:27.796 --> 03:03:28.364
A LONG HISTORY ON THIS ISSUE --

03:03:28.430 --> 03:03:30.332
WHICH IS IS REALLY HELPFUL AS AN

03:03:30.399 --> 03:03:32.768
AUTHOR -- I UNDERSTAND THE

03:03:32.835 --> 03:03:34.269
CIRCUMSTANCES THAT LED UP TO THE

03:03:34.336 --> 03:03:36.105
INTERSECTION OF THIS PARTICULAR

03:03:36.171 --> 03:03:37.940
BILL -- I'M JUST WONDERING HOW

03:03:38.006 --> 03:03:39.875
WOULD A WEBSITE KNOW IF SOMEONE

03:03:39.942 --> 03:03:41.643
WAS A MINOR I MEAN IT'S REALLY

03:03:41.710 --> 03:03:43.479
DIFFICULT WHEN.

03:03:43.545 --> 03:03:44.113
HERE YOU KNOW YOU'VE GOT SOME

03:03:44.179 --> 03:03:45.314
PHYSICAL DISTANCE BETWEEN YOU

03:03:45.381 --> 03:03:46.281

03:03:46.348 --> 03:03:47.649
CONSUMERS REPRESENTING THAT

03:03:47.716 --> 03:03:49.084
THEY'RE NOT A MINOR.

03:03:49.151 --> 03:03:50.352
AND YES I MEAN I UNDERSTAND THAT

03:03:50.419 --> 03:03:51.754
THERE'S IT LENDS ITSELF TO ABUSE

03:03:51.820 --> 03:03:53.489
YOU CAN'T HAVE YOUR BLINDERS ON%

03:03:53.555 --> 03:03:55.824
BUT ALSO YOU CAN'T ABSOLUTELY

03:03:55.891 --> 03:03:57.326
KNOW WITH CERTAINTY THAT SOMEONE.

03:03:57.393 --> 03:03:59.094
IS THE AGE THAT THEY'RE SAYING

03:03:59.161 --> 03:04:00.629
THAT THEY ARE SO -- YOU HAVE

03:04:00.696 --> 03:04:02.231
LANGUAGES AND PREVIOUS BILLS

03:04:02.297 --> 03:04:03.298
THAT YOU RUN.

03:04:03.365 --> 03:04:04.400
YOU KNOW WHERE YOU GOT MORE

03:04:04.466 --> 03:04:06.468
CIRCUMSPECT ABOUT THE WAY YOU TO

03:04:06.535 --> 03:04:08.036
FIND THAT AND AND PUT SOME

03:04:08.103 --> 03:04:09.571
SPECIFICITY INTO.

03:04:09.638 --> 03:04:11.840
WHAT RESPONSIBILITIES OR TRY

03:04:11.907 --> 03:04:13.308
PROVIDERS HAVE YOU KNOW HAD --

03:04:13.375 --> 03:04:17.246
BUT THIS BILL IS VERY STARK SO I

03:04:17.312 --> 03:04:17.780
JUST WONDERED IF YOU COULD

03:04:17.846 --> 03:04:18.981
COMMENT ON THAT.

03:04:19.047 --> 03:04:20.149
ALL THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION

03:04:20.215 --> 03:04:22.050
THERE'S NEVER ANY GUARANTEE THAT

03:04:22.117 --> 03:04:23.218
YOU KNOW A WEBSITE IS --

03:04:23.285 --> 03:04:27.122
PARTICULARLY TAYLOR AN AWFUL FOR

03:04:27.189 --> 03:04:28.157
FOR FOR FOR MINORS BIT BUT BUT I

03:04:28.223 --> 03:04:30.459
THINK ESSENTIALLY YOU KNOW --

03:04:30.526 --> 03:04:31.693
BASING IT ON STATISTICS I THINK

03:04:31.760 --> 03:04:34.062
SO SO THAT'S WHAT THE ORIGINAL

03:04:34.129 --> 03:04:36.398
OF BILL WAS SO BASED ON ALSO I

03:04:36.465 --> 03:04:38.467
THINK WHEN WE PASS -- THE

03:04:38.534 --> 03:04:40.602
STEINBERG BILL -- FEW YEARS AGO --

03:04:40.669 --> 03:04:43.038
SO WE WERE BASICALLY TARGETING

03:04:43.105 --> 03:04:47.776
WEBSITE SAID WE BELIEVE ARM THAT.

03:04:47.843 --> 03:04:51.046
KIDS WOULD VISIT NUMBER ONE OR

03:04:51.113 --> 03:04:52.214
SUIT THAT'S ALL BASED ON

03:04:52.281 --> 03:04:54.683
STATISTICS.

03:04:54.750 --> 03:04:56.952
AND AND ARE YOU KNOW SO.

03:04:57.019 --> 03:04:59.121
SO YEAH I THINK THAT'S THE SHORT

03:04:59.188 --> 03:05:00.656
ANSWER.

03:05:00.722 --> 03:05:09.898
TO YOUR QUESTION ON SOUL -- SO

03:05:09.965 --> 03:05:12.367
IT AT A YOU WANT TO ADD ANY MORE

03:05:12.434 --> 03:05:13.435
TO IT.

03:05:13.502 --> 03:05:17.339
THE ASSEMBLY THROUGH THE CHAIR.

03:05:17.406 --> 03:05:22.177
YOUR TEACHER -- THE I THINK THE

03:05:22.244 --> 03:05:23.345
ANSWER IS WHITE WHAT'S NOT IN

03:05:23.412 --> 03:05:24.346
THE BILL ASSEMBLY MEMBER THE

03:05:24.413 --> 03:05:25.581
BILL SPECIFIES THAT THERE NEEDS

03:05:25.647 --> 03:05:26.982
TO BE AN EFFORT TO GET PARENTAL

03:05:27.049 --> 03:05:27.649
CONSENT DIRECTED AT THE PARENTS.

03:05:27.716 --> 03:05:29.017
IT DOES NOT SPECIFY A

03:05:29.084 --> 03:05:29.585
CONSEQUENCE IF IN FACT IT

03:05:29.651 --> 03:05:30.219
GENERALLY DOESN'T HAPPEN THAT

03:05:30.285 --> 03:05:31.420
ABSOLUTE CONSISTENT WITH THE WAY

03:05:31.487 --> 03:05:32.054
THAT WORKS IN THE REAL WORLD --

03:05:32.120 --> 03:05:33.088
WITHIN THE LAST TIME THIS BILL

03:05:33.155 --> 03:05:33.722
IS BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE WE HAD

03:05:33.789 --> 03:05:34.990
A ROBUST CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW

03:05:35.057 --> 03:05:35.591
PARENTAL CONSENT WORKS IN THE

03:05:35.657 --> 03:05:35.891
REAL WORLD.

03:05:35.958 --> 03:05:37.326
MOST CHILDREN DON'T WHY -- MY

03:05:37.392 --> 03:05:38.861

03:05:52.941 --> 03:05:54.042
ABLE TO NOT NECESSARILY DRAW ME

03:05:54.109 --> 03:05:56.111
