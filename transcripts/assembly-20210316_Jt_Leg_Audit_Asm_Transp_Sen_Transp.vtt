GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION

00:29:42.981 --> 00:29:45.183
PROGRAMS OVERSEEN BY CARB. IS A

00:29:45.250 --> 00:29:46.885
VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE THE

00:29:46.951 --> 00:29:48.686
CALIFORNIA'S ME TREMENDOUS

00:29:48.753 --> 00:29:50.622
STRIDES IN REDUCING GHG.

MANY AND ADDRESSING CLIMATE

00:29:54.058 --> 00:29:56.094
CHANGE. HOWEVER THERE ARE STILL

00:29:56.161 --> 00:29:58.630
LARGE AREAS OF OUR STATE I KNOW

00:29:58.696 --> 00:29:59.497
LIKE FOR THE CENTRAL VALLEY FOR

00:29:59.564 --> 00:30:01.699
INSTANCE I WHERE I RESIDE THAT

00:30:01.766 --> 00:30:04.068
WHERE THE AIR QUALITY RANKS

00:30:04.135 --> 00:30:05.103
AMONG THE WORST IN THE NATION.

00:30:05.170 --> 00:30:07.238
POLLUTED AIR IS LINKED TO A

00:30:07.305 --> 00:30:08.573
VARIETY OF HEALTH CONCERNS

00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:12.243
RANGING FROM. SERIOUS DISEASES

00:30:12.310 --> 00:30:14.045
OR EVEN PREMATURE DEATH NOT

00:30:14.112 --> 00:30:15.480
ONLY ARE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS

00:30:15.547 --> 00:30:17.182
LIVING IN POLLUTED AREAS WHERE

00:30:17.248 --> 00:30:18.116
THEY ARE EXPERIENCING HIGHER

00:30:18.183 --> 00:30:20.418
HEALTH RISKS BUT SOME ARE ALSO

00:30:20.485 --> 00:30:22.954
LIVING IN EXTREME POVERTY. LOW

00:30:23.021 --> 00:30:24.255
INCOME COMMUNITIES AND

00:30:24.322 --> 00:30:25.790
INDIVIDUALS HAVE CARRIED THE

00:30:25.857 --> 00:30:27.158
DISPROPORTIONATE BURDEN OF

00:30:27.225 --> 00:30:29.060
ENVIRONMENTAL INJUSTICE.

00:30:29.127 --> 00:30:30.361
THEREFORE IT IS CRITICAL THAT

00:30:30.428 --> 00:30:32.063
IN ADDITION TO REDUCING HG

00:30:32.130 --> 00:30:33.932
EMISSIONS. THE PROGRAMS

00:30:33.998 --> 00:30:35.667
OVERSEEN BY CARP SHOULD ALSO

00:30:35.733 --> 00:30:36.601
ACHIEVE SOCIAL ECONOMIC

00:30:36.668 --> 00:30:38.603

DISADVANTAGED AND LOW INCOME

00:30:40.538 --> 00:30:42.907
COMMUNITIES. MOREOVER I BELIEVE

00:30:42.974 --> 00:30:44.676
THAT GHG POLICIES AND PROGRAMS

00:30:44.742 --> 00:30:46.010
IN THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR

00:30:46.077 --> 00:30:47.745
MUST BE APPLIED FAIRLY AND

00:30:47.812 --> 00:30:49.681
EQUITABLY IN ORDER FOR THEM TO

00:30:49.747 --> 00:30:52.850
BE EFFECTIVE. HOWEVER IN LATE

00:30:52.917 --> 00:30:53.484
TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE LEGISLATIVE

00:30:53.551 --> 00:30:54.686

STATUTORY GHG EMISSION GOALS

00:31:01.259 --> 00:31:02.193
AND THAT LEFT ME AND MANY

00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:04.295
OTHERS WITH MORE QUESTIONS THAN

BENEFITS OF THESE PROGRAMS AND

00:31:10.368 --> 00:31:12.470

00:31:12.537 --> 00:31:14.606
THE ALEJO'S FINDINGS LEFT ME

00:31:14.672 --> 00:31:16.774
WONDERING. HOW THE STATE COULD

00:31:16.841 --> 00:31:17.976
SPEND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON

00:31:18.042 --> 00:31:20.278
INCENTIVE PROGRAMS AIMED AT

00:31:20.345 --> 00:31:22.580
LOWERING GHG BULAK PROGRAM

00:31:28.519 --> 00:31:30.321
RAISES SIMILAR QUESTIONS AND

00:31:30.388 --> 00:31:32.724
CONCERNS SPECIFICALLY IT FOUND

00:31:32.790 --> 00:31:34.659
THAT CAR HAS NOT DONE ENOUGH TO

00:31:34.726 --> 00:31:36.227
MEASURE THE GHG EMISSION

00:31:36.294 --> 00:31:38.830

DETERMINE WHETHER. OR HOW ITS

00:31:47.272 --> 00:31:50.341
INCENTIVE PROGRAMS REDUCE GHG

00:31:50.408 --> 00:31:52.543
EMISSIONS WITHOUT PROGRAM

00:31:52.610 --> 00:31:53.945

WE ARE HAVING THE BEST IMPACT

00:32:00.051 --> 00:32:01.452
FOR THAT DOLLAR IN OUR MOST

00:32:01.519 --> 00:32:03.421
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES.

00:32:03.488 --> 00:32:04.856
ADDITIONALLY THE REPORT FOUND

00:32:04.922 --> 00:32:06.291

CHANGE- RIGHT NOW IS CERTAINLY

00:33:15.393 --> 00:33:16.527
ON EVERYONE'S MIND IN FEW

00:33:16.594 --> 00:33:17.862
BELIEVE IN SCIENCE WHICH I DO

00:33:17.929 --> 00:33:18.863
AND LISTEN TO SCIENTISTS

00:33:18.930 --> 00:33:20.431
CLIMATE CHANGE AND CLIMATE

00:33:20.498 --> 00:33:22.066
IMPACTS IN THE FUTURE IF WE

00:33:22.133 --> 00:33:23.835
DON'T TAKE RADICAL ACTION ARE

00:33:23.901 --> 00:33:24.702
GOING TO BE THE BIGGEST

00:33:24.769 --> 00:33:26.537
CHALLENGE THAT THIS THAT ANYONE

00:33:26.604 --> 00:33:27.538
IN RECENT MEMORY HAS EVER

00:33:27.605 --> 00:33:29.374
FACED. IT'S SOMETHING THAT I

00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:30.608
WORRY ABOUT EVERY DAY I WORRY

00:33:30.675 --> 00:33:33.010
ABOUT MY DAUGHTER AND THE

00:33:33.077 --> 00:33:33.945
PLANET THAT SHE'S GOING TO

00:33:34.011 --> 00:33:36.647
INHERIT I WORRY ABOUT OUR OWN

00:33:36.714 --> 00:33:37.749
STATE AND OUR CONSTITUENTS AND

00:33:37.815 --> 00:33:41.786
THERE WILL HOW THEY WILL ADJUST

00:33:41.853 --> 00:33:44.355
TO CLIMATE CHANGE TO DROUGHT TO

00:33:44.422 --> 00:33:45.423
THE TYPES OF CROPS THAT WERE

00:33:45.490 --> 00:33:46.991
ABLE TO ARE NOT ABLE TO GROW IN

00:33:47.058 --> 00:33:48.359
CALIFORNIA TO WHAT'S GOING TO

00:33:48.426 --> 00:33:49.927
HAPPEN TO OUR COASTLINE TO OUR

00:33:49.994 --> 00:33:51.596
COMMUNITIES THIS IS SOMETHING

00:33:51.662 --> 00:33:54.532
THAT WE NEED TO TAKE EXTREMELY

00:33:54.599 --> 00:33:55.066
SERIOUSLY. NOW THE

00:33:55.133 --> 00:33:56.300
TRANSPORTATION SECTOR HAS

00:33:56.367 --> 00:33:57.735
STRUGGLED FOR MANY YEARS WITH

00:33:57.802 --> 00:33:59.404
GHG REDUCTIONS IN THE CONTINUES

00:33:59.470 --> 00:34:01.406
TO STRUGGLE IN. IN MY MIND IT'S

00:34:01.472 --> 00:34:02.707
NOT JUST BECAUSE OF THE TYPE OF

00:34:02.774 --> 00:34:04.509
FUEL THAT'S USED. IT'S ALSO

00:34:04.575 --> 00:34:06.244
HAS- HAS TO DO WITH LAND USE

00:34:06.310 --> 00:34:08.613
POLICIES. AND HOW WE ALLOW

00:34:08.679 --> 00:34:10.114
PEOPLE ARE DOING ALLOW PEOPLE

00:34:10.181 --> 00:34:11.883
TO MOVE AROUND THEIR

00:34:11.949 --> 00:34:13.851
COMMUNITIES- IT'S ABOUT WHERE

00:34:13.918 --> 00:34:15.520
WE LIVE IT OUT WE CAN AFFORD TO

00:34:15.586 --> 00:34:17.722
LIVE IT'S ABOUT WHAT WE- NEED

00:34:17.789 --> 00:34:19.490
TO GET TO HAVE OUR LIVES.

00:34:19.557 --> 00:34:21.526
BEYOND A MANY OF THESE ISSUES

00:34:21.592 --> 00:34:23.661
GO WELL BEYOND CARBS OR CARBS

00:34:23.728 --> 00:34:25.897
OF THIRTY. AND SO I THINK AS WE

00:34:25.963 --> 00:34:27.031
MOVE FORWARD IT'S IMPORTANT TO

00:34:27.098 --> 00:34:28.032
REMEMBER THAT THERE'S A LOT OF

00:34:28.099 --> 00:34:30.067
FACTORS THAT GO INTO. HOW

00:34:30.134 --> 00:34:31.002
PEOPLE MOVE AROUND THE

00:34:31.068 --> 00:34:32.870
COMMUNITY HOW THEY DRIVE AND

00:34:32.937 --> 00:34:34.739
WHAT CAR WAS ABLE TO DO AND NOT

00:34:34.806 --> 00:34:37.108
ABLE TO DO. THAT I WANT TO SAY

00:34:37.175 --> 00:34:38.543
JUST KIND OF OUTSIDE OF THIS

00:34:38.609 --> 00:34:39.877
TOPIC A LITTLE BIT I THINK THAT

00:34:39.944 --> 00:34:40.611
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT AS WE

00:34:40.678 --> 00:34:42.113
MOVE FORWARD THAT WE DECIDE LOW

00:34:42.180 --> 00:34:43.314
A LOT OF THESE CONVERSATIONS

00:34:43.381 --> 00:34:44.615
TRANSPORTATION LAND USE

00:34:44.682 --> 00:34:46.117
HOUSING. THEY'RE ALL PART OF A

00:34:46.184 --> 00:34:48.519
LARGER. CONVERSATION THAT NEEDS

00:34:48.586 --> 00:34:50.555
TO BE MORE HOLISTIC. I AM

00:34:50.621 --> 00:34:51.789

ALL OF YOU TO PARTICIPATE IN

00:34:56.994 --> 00:34:59.197
THAT. I DO TODAY WANT TO DIVE

00:34:59.263 --> 00:35:00.498
INTO TALK ABOUT FEASIBLE

00:35:00.565 --> 00:35:01.999
REALISTIC CHANGES THAT CAN BE

00:35:02.066 --> 00:35:03.734
MADE. WITH THE UNDERSTANDING

00:35:03.801 --> 00:35:04.802
THAT THE ANSWERS TO SOME OF

00:35:04.869 --> 00:35:06.070
THESE QUESTIONS MIGHT VERY WELL

00:35:06.137 --> 00:35:08.739
BE ON NOBLE. AND I HOPE TO COME

00:35:08.806 --> 00:35:09.507
AWAY TODAY WITH AN

00:35:09.574 --> 00:35:11.075

WE'RE GOING TO GO OVER AYE WE

00:41:31.188 --> 00:41:33.290

THREE PAGES AND BASICALLY WHAT

THOSE PAGES WILL DO WILL

00:41:44.768 --> 00:41:46.670
ILLUSTRATE. EACH OF THE KEY KEY

00:41:46.737 --> 00:41:47.605
ISSUES THAT I'M GOING TO

00:41:47.671 --> 00:41:49.840
DISCUSS SO THE FIRST ISSUE AS

00:41:49.907 --> 00:41:52.810
AS SOME OF THE MEMBERS THAT

00:41:52.877 --> 00:41:54.578
INTRODUCED IT. NUMBER FRIEDMAN

00:41:54.645 --> 00:41:56.947
MISTER SALAS AND GONZALEZ IS

00:41:57.014 --> 00:41:58.916
THERE ARE IMPORTANT PROGRAMS

00:41:58.983 --> 00:42:01.018
THAT CALIFORNIA ADMINISTERS-

00:42:01.085 --> 00:42:03.254
BUT WHAT WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT

00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:04.722
IN THE FIRST ISSUE IS WHETHER

00:42:04.788 --> 00:42:06.991
OR NOT CARD IS ABLE TO.

00:42:07.057 --> 00:42:09.193
PROPERLY MEASURE THE EFFECT OF

00:42:09.260 --> 00:42:10.728
THOSE PROGRAMS AND WE HAVE

00:42:10.794 --> 00:42:12.763
REGULATORY PROGRAMS REQUIRED

00:42:12.830 --> 00:42:14.398
PROGRAMS AND THEN WE ALSO

00:42:14.465 --> 00:42:15.366
CERTAINLY HAVE INCENTIVE

00:42:15.432 --> 00:42:17.468
PROGRAMS AND THOSE PROGRAMS AND

00:42:17.534 --> 00:42:19.703
MANY CASES WORK TOGETHER. ON

00:42:19.770 --> 00:42:21.238
THE ISSUE WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA

00:42:21.305 --> 00:42:23.540
IS CARD DOESN'T HAVE THE

00:42:23.607 --> 00:42:25.276
ABILITY OR DOESN'T AT THIS

00:42:25.342 --> 00:42:27.311
POINT IN TIME. HAVE THE

00:42:27.378 --> 00:42:29.246
CAPABILITY OF MEASURING THE

00:42:29.313 --> 00:42:31.715
DISTINCTION BETWEEN WHAT GHG

00:42:31.782 --> 00:42:33.817
EMISSION BENEFITS AS CALIFORNIA

00:42:33.884 --> 00:42:35.419
RECEIVING FROM ITS REGULATORY

00:42:35.486 --> 00:42:37.554
PROGRAMS VERSES IT'S INCENTIVE

00:42:37.621 --> 00:42:39.356
PROGRAMS THE REASON THAT'S

00:42:39.423 --> 00:42:41.425
IMPORTANT IS AS CALIFORNIA.

00:42:41.492 --> 00:42:44.528
DECIDES TO INVEST MORE AND MORE

00:42:44.595 --> 00:42:47.131
DOLLARS INTO INCENTIVE PROGRAMS

00:42:47.197 --> 00:42:48.098
WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE'RE

00:42:48.165 --> 00:42:50.000
INVESTING IN THE PROGRAMS THAT

00:42:50.067 --> 00:42:51.669
ARE MOST BENEFICIAL TO THE

00:42:51.735 --> 00:42:53.137
STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ARE IN

00:42:53.203 --> 00:42:55.339
REDUCING GHG EMISSIONS AND

00:42:55.406 --> 00:42:56.941
CERTAINLY- CREATING-

00:42:57.007 --> 00:42:58.809
SOCIOECONOMIC BENEFITS OFFER

00:42:58.876 --> 00:43:00.044
COMMUNITIES DISADVANTAGED

00:43:00.110 --> 00:43:01.445
COMMUNITIES LOW INCOME

00:43:01.512 --> 00:43:02.947
COMMUNITIES SO THE FIRST KEY

00:43:03.013 --> 00:43:05.749
ISSUE IS. WHETHER OR NOT CARD

00:43:05.816 --> 00:43:07.685
AND WE FOUND A CAR DOESN'T HAVE

00:43:07.751 --> 00:43:09.086
THE ABILITY RIGHT NOW WE THINK

00:43:09.153 --> 00:43:11.622
THEY CAN AND SHOULD. BE ABLE TO

00:43:11.689 --> 00:43:13.490
IDENTIFY THE BENEFITS DERIVED

00:43:13.557 --> 00:43:15.426
FROM ITS REGULATORY PROGRAMS

00:43:15.492 --> 00:43:17.428
VERSUS ITS INCENTIVE PROGRAMS.

00:43:17.494 --> 00:43:18.762
THE REASON THIS IS CRITICALLY

00:43:18.829 --> 00:43:20.631
IMPORTANT AS WELL IN ADDITION

00:43:20.698 --> 00:43:21.265
TO INVESTING IN THE APPROPRIATE

00:43:21.332 --> 00:43:25.602
PROGRAMS IS. A WE HAVE A VERY

00:43:25.669 --> 00:43:26.804
AGGRESSIVE. ALL OF READ. GHG

00:43:26.870 --> 00:43:28.772
EMISSIONS BY TWENTY THIRTY AND

00:43:28.839 --> 00:43:29.206
IT HAS TO BE REDUCED

00:43:29.273 --> 00:43:31.041
SIGNIFICANTLY WE'RE GONNA

00:43:31.108 --> 00:43:32.443
SPEAKING ABOUT TRANSPORTATION

00:43:32.509 --> 00:43:34.211
SECTOR THAT'S SPECIFICALLY WHAT

00:43:34.278 --> 00:43:35.212
THE AUDIT COMMITTEE MR

00:43:35.279 --> 00:43:37.648
BRADFORD'S REQUEST ASK US TO

00:43:37.715 --> 00:43:39.416
LOOK AT. BECAUSE THE

00:43:39.483 --> 00:43:41.418
TRANSPORTATION SECTOR.

00:43:41.485 --> 00:43:43.620
PASSENGER VEHICLES TRUCKS-

00:43:43.687 --> 00:43:46.857
HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS ETCETERA. ARE

00:43:46.924 --> 00:43:50.327
MAJOR CONTRIBUTORS TO EMISSIONS

00:43:50.394 --> 00:43:52.563
IN CALIFORNIA GREENHOUSE GASES-

00:43:52.629 --> 00:43:53.697
SO THAT'S THE SECTOR THAT

00:43:53.764 --> 00:43:55.199
CALIFORNIA REALLY NEEDS TO

00:43:55.265 --> 00:43:57.501
FOCUS ON IN FACT THAT SECTOR

00:43:57.568 --> 00:43:58.769
OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS

00:43:58.836 --> 00:44:00.571
CONTINUES TO SHOW AN INCREASE

00:44:00.637 --> 00:44:01.972
IN EMISSIONS RATHER THAN A

00:44:02.039 --> 00:44:04.074
DECREASE IN THE NATION SO.

00:44:04.141 --> 00:44:04.908
THERE REALLY DOES NEED TO BE A

00:44:04.975 --> 00:44:07.811
FOCUS ON THIS PARTICULAR SECTOR

00:44:07.878 --> 00:44:09.513
AND THOSE REGULATORY PROGRAMS

00:44:09.580 --> 00:44:10.547
AS WELL AS THE INCENTIVE

00:44:10.614 --> 00:44:12.282
PROGRAMS SO THAT'S THE FIRST

00:44:12.349 --> 00:44:13.450
ISSUE THAT WE IDENTIFIED IN THE

00:44:13.517 --> 00:44:15.285
REPORT- AND MR WRITER REAL

00:44:15.352 --> 00:44:16.620
STEPPING THROUGH SOME MORE

00:44:16.687 --> 00:44:18.322
SPECIFICS RELATED TO THAT. THE

00:44:18.389 --> 00:44:19.623
SECOND ISSUE IS THE SOCIO

00:44:19.690 --> 00:44:21.325
ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF THE

00:44:21.392 --> 00:44:22.760
LEGISLATURE CLEARLY HAD

00:44:22.826 --> 00:44:24.294
INTENTION AT SOME OF THESE

00:44:24.361 --> 00:44:25.929
PROGRAMS WOULD BENEFIT

00:44:25.996 --> 00:44:27.598
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES LOW

00:44:27.664 --> 00:44:29.166
INCOME YOU LOW INCOME

00:44:29.233 --> 00:44:32.236
COMMUNITIES- AND ACTUALLY

00:44:32.302 --> 00:44:33.971
REQUIRED CARD TO INVEST A

00:44:34.038 --> 00:44:35.773
CERTAIN AMOUNT OF FUNDING IN

00:44:35.839 --> 00:44:37.341
THOSE COMMUNITIES 25%

00:44:37.408 --> 00:44:39.143
DISADVANTAGED. 10% AND LOW

00:44:39.209 --> 00:44:41.211
INCOME IN THE AGGREGATE

00:44:41.278 --> 00:44:43.380
CALIFORNIA IS DOING THAT WE ARE

00:44:43.447 --> 00:44:45.549
INVESTING A LOT. MORE THAN THAT

00:44:45.616 --> 00:44:47.785
THOSE PARTICULAR PERCENTAGES.

00:44:47.851 --> 00:44:49.720
THE PROBLEM WE FOUND WITH THIS

00:44:49.787 --> 00:44:52.122
PARTICULAR AREA IS CARD NOT

00:44:52.189 --> 00:44:53.524
DOING AS GOOD A JOB AS IT

00:44:53.590 --> 00:44:56.126
SHOULD AND IS REQUIRED TO DO TO

00:44:56.193 --> 00:44:57.761
MEASURE WHETHER OR NOT THOSE

00:44:57.828 --> 00:44:59.530
SOCIOECONOMIC BENEFITS ARE

00:44:59.596 --> 00:45:02.032
OCCURRING IN THOSE COMMUNITIES-

00:45:02.099 --> 00:45:05.169
I'M SPECIFICALLY TALKING ABOUT-

00:45:05.235 --> 00:45:07.638
LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. AND

00:45:07.704 --> 00:45:08.705
SOME OF THE JOB TRAINING

00:45:08.772 --> 00:45:10.474
PROGRAMS THAT THAT CARB

00:45:10.541 --> 00:45:12.309
INTENDED TO ESTABLISH AND FUND

00:45:12.376 --> 00:45:13.777
WHETHER OR NOT THOSE PROGRAMS

00:45:13.844 --> 00:45:16.013
ARE PROVIDING JOB TRAINING TO

00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:17.247
INDIVIDUALS IN LOW INCOME

00:45:17.314 --> 00:45:18.849
COMMUNITIES SO THEY CAN GAIN

00:45:18.916 --> 00:45:21.085
EMPLOYMENT IN THIS INDUSTRY. IN

00:45:21.151 --> 00:45:22.052
ADDITION THERE WERE SOME

00:45:22.119 --> 00:45:25.823
REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO JOB

00:45:25.889 --> 00:45:26.824
CREATION HI OF JOBS THAT THESE

00:45:26.890 --> 00:45:29.193
PROGRAMS SUPPORT. AND SO WE

00:45:29.259 --> 00:45:30.994
EXPECTED TO SEE BETTER

00:45:31.061 --> 00:45:33.697
MEASUREMENT BY CARD AS TO THOSE

00:45:33.764 --> 00:45:35.399
BENEFITS AND IN FACT CARBS OWN

00:45:35.466 --> 00:45:37.367
GUIDELINES FROM TWENTY FIFTEEN

00:45:37.434 --> 00:45:39.203
THEY ESTABLISHED IN TWENTY

00:45:39.269 --> 00:45:40.337
FIFTEEN REQUIRED THEM TO TRACK

00:45:40.404 --> 00:45:41.972
SOME OF THIS INFORMATION. AND

00:45:42.039 --> 00:45:43.407
MAY NOT ARE NOT DOING AS GOOD A

00:45:43.474 --> 00:45:45.409

LEGISLATURE AS THEY COULD AND

00:45:48.479 --> 00:45:50.681
SHOULD BE DOING. SO IN THE AREA

00:45:50.747 --> 00:45:52.549
OF SOCIOECONOMIC BENEFITS EVEN

00:45:52.616 --> 00:45:54.284
THOUGH IN THE AGGREGATE AGAIN

00:45:54.351 --> 00:45:55.686
THEY ARE INVESTING IN

00:45:55.752 --> 00:45:56.787
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES IN

00:45:56.854 --> 00:45:58.322
LINE CAN COMMUNITIES THE

00:45:58.388 --> 00:46:00.157
IMPORTANT ASPECT IS ARE THEY

00:46:31.755 --> 00:46:33.290
EXPECTING CARP TO BE ABLE TO

00:46:33.357 --> 00:46:35.025

THINK WE AS A MOST RECENT DATA.

00:49:34.871 --> 00:49:36.073
CALIFORNIA USED TO REDUCE TOTAL

TRANSPORTATION CONTINUES TO BE

00:50:03.734 --> 00:50:05.302
AN AREA WHERE WE HOPE THAT

00:50:05.369 --> 00:50:08.605
THERE'S A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY

00:50:08.672 --> 00:50:09.072

ROADS BY TWENTY THIRTY THAT'S

00:53:00.377 --> 00:53:02.178
AN AMBITIOUS GOAL. IN ORDER TO

ARE SOME OF THE KNOWN PRO ARE.

00:54:00.704 --> 00:54:02.606
PETE THAT'S A VEHICLE READING

00:54:02.672 --> 00:54:04.608
PROGRAM AND THEN- THERE ARE

00:54:04.674 --> 00:54:05.809
ALSO SOME PROGRAMS ARE SLIGHTLY

00:54:05.875 --> 00:54:08.411
SMALLER IN SIZE. INCLUDING THE

TO. TO A MOTIVATE THEM TO

00:54:19.756 --> 00:54:22.359
pALREADY YOU'RE SEEING THE

00:54:22.425 --> 00:54:23.793
OVERLAP IS A REGULATION THAT

00:54:23.860 --> 00:54:24.828
REQUIRES THE SALE OF THESE

00:54:24.894 --> 00:54:26.596

ENCOURAGE THEM TO PURCHASE THE

00:54:32.535 --> 00:54:33.003
PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN CRIMES

LIKE THE HIGH OCCUPANCY VEHICLE

00:54:41.511 --> 00:54:45.248
LANES- SO YOU CAN SEE WHERE THE

00:54:45.315 --> 00:54:47.384
OVERLAPPING THE COMPLICATION

00:54:47.450 --> 00:54:49.753
STARTS. OUR UNFORTUNATELY ARE

00:54:49.819 --> 00:54:50.987
REVIEWED ON A CAR DOES NOT DO

00:54:51.054 --> 00:54:52.022
ENOUGH TO COORDINATE ITS

00:54:52.088 --> 00:54:53.556
MEASUREMENT OVERLAPPING

00:54:53.623 --> 00:54:55.425
REGULATORY INCENTIVE PROGRAMS-

00:54:55.492 --> 00:54:56.459
THAT HAS TO DO WITH ON THE

00:54:56.526 --> 00:54:57.827
FRONT END IT DOESN'T DO ENOUGH

00:54:57.894 --> 00:54:58.528
IN THE DESIGN AND

00:54:58.595 --> 00:55:03.566
IMPLEMENTATION. ANOTHER AND

00:55:03.633 --> 00:55:04.434
THAT IS WHEN THEY DEVELOP A

00:55:04.501 --> 00:55:06.403
REGULATION PROGRAM THEY'RE NOT

00:55:06.469 --> 00:55:08.304
NECESSARILY LOOKING FOR THE

00:55:08.371 --> 00:55:10.006
INFLUENCE OF THE OF THE-

00:55:10.073 --> 00:55:11.408
INCENTIVE PROGRAMS AND VICE

00:55:11.474 --> 00:55:13.543
VERSA THEY'RE NOT ACCOUNTING

00:55:13.610 --> 00:55:14.411
FOR REGULATORY PROGRAMS THAT

00:55:14.477 --> 00:55:15.879
MIGHT REQUIRES THEMSELVES WHEN

00:55:15.945 --> 00:55:16.646
THEY PUT INTO PLACE SOMETHING

00:55:16.713 --> 00:55:18.615
LIKE CTRP OR RATHER WHEN THEY

00:55:18.682 --> 00:55:19.482
GO BACK TO THE TABLE AND

00:55:19.549 --> 00:55:20.417
DETERMINE WHETHER THEY SHOULD

00:55:20.483 --> 00:55:23.486
BE FINE CTRP MAKE ANY CHANGES

00:55:23.553 --> 00:55:25.555
TO IT. THAT ISSUE CARRIES ON

00:55:25.622 --> 00:55:26.656
THROUGH THE MEASUREMENT OF

00:55:26.723 --> 00:55:29.592
THESE PROGRAMS WE FOUND. THAT

00:55:29.659 --> 00:55:31.261
WHEN THE WAY THE CAR MEASURES

00:55:31.327 --> 00:55:32.829
COMPLIANCE WITH ITS REGULATORY

00:55:32.896 --> 00:55:34.531
PROGRAMS DOES NOT TRANSLATE

00:55:34.597 --> 00:55:36.633
EASILY HOW IT TALKS ABOUT ITS

00:55:36.700 --> 00:55:38.435
INCENTIVE PROGRAMS. THAT IS THE

00:55:38.501 --> 00:55:39.836
COMPLIANCE WITH THIS REGULATORY

00:55:39.903 --> 00:55:41.237
PROGRAMS ARE NOT FOCUSED ON THE

00:55:41.304 --> 00:55:42.939
NUMBER OF VEHICLES NECESSARILY

00:55:43.006 --> 00:55:44.207
WHERE IS THAT IS HOW CAR TRACKS

00:55:44.274 --> 00:55:45.875
REPORTS ON THE INCENTIVE

00:55:45.942 --> 00:55:48.178
PROGRAM SO ALREADY. CARP HAS

00:55:48.244 --> 00:55:49.179
PUT ITSELF IN A POSITION WHERE

00:55:49.245 --> 00:55:50.447
IT'S DIFFICULT FOR ITS TWO

00:55:50.513 --> 00:55:53.283
DIFFERENT PROGRAMS TO TALK TO

00:55:53.349 --> 00:55:53.883
ONE ANOTHER IN TERMS OF THEIR

00:55:53.950 --> 00:55:55.518
OUT. AND THEN THERE'S A LARGE

00:55:55.585 --> 00:55:56.619
QUESTION RELATED TO CONSUMER

00:55:56.686 --> 00:55:58.588
BEHAVIOR AGAIN THE PURPOSE OF

00:55:58.655 --> 00:55:59.789
THESE INCENTIVE PROGRAMS IS TO

00:55:59.856 --> 00:56:00.957
GET CONSUMERS TO DO THINGS THAT

00:56:01.024 --> 00:56:02.859
THEY WOULDN'T OTHERWISE DO BY

00:56:02.926 --> 00:56:03.393
MAKING IT MORE ATTRACTIVE

00:56:03.460 --> 00:56:05.295
PROPOSITION. HOWEVER WE FOUND

00:56:05.361 --> 00:56:06.229
THAT CAR GENERALLY CANNOT

00:56:06.296 --> 00:56:07.630
DEMONSTRATE THAT ITS INCENTIVE

00:56:07.697 --> 00:56:09.466
PROGRAMS TO THAT. ONE REASON

00:56:09.532 --> 00:56:10.500
THEY CANNOT IS THAT CRIME

00:56:10.567 --> 00:56:12.068
GENERALLY DOESN'T ACTUALLY ASK

00:56:12.135 --> 00:56:13.336
ITS PARTICIPANTS WHETHER OR

00:56:13.403 --> 00:56:16.139
NOT- THE INCENTIVE PROGRAM WAS

00:56:16.206 --> 00:56:17.941
WAS INSTRUMENTAL OR OR WAS THE

00:56:18.007 --> 00:56:20.643
DECIDING FACTOR IN THEIR

00:56:20.710 --> 00:56:22.378
DECISION TO PURCHASE. AND SO IF

00:56:22.445 --> 00:56:23.279
THAT'S NOT THE CASE THEN IT

00:56:23.346 --> 00:56:24.681
DIFFICULT FOR CARP TO ASSIGN

00:56:24.748 --> 00:56:27.050
CREDIT FOR THAT PURCHASE TO THE

00:56:27.117 --> 00:56:31.955
INCENTIVE PROGRAM- THAT THAT'S

00:56:32.021 --> 00:56:33.256
IMPORTANT BECAUSE AGAIN ALL

00:56:33.323 --> 00:56:35.725
THESE BENEFITS FLOW FROM THE

00:56:35.792 --> 00:56:36.926
INFLUENCE OF THE INCENTIVE

00:56:36.993 --> 00:56:38.928
PROGRAM ON A PURCHASE DECISION.

00:56:38.995 --> 00:56:40.396
AND KNOWING HOW EFFECTIVE THAT

00:56:40.463 --> 00:56:41.931
PROGRAM IS REQUIRES

00:56:41.998 --> 00:56:44.534
DISENTANGLING THAT BENEFIT FROM

00:56:44.601 --> 00:56:45.135
FROM SOMETHING LIKE THE

00:56:45.201 --> 00:56:47.370
REGULATIONS. IN THE CASE OF CRP

00:56:47.437 --> 00:56:48.505
WHICH IS THE ONE PROGRAM WE

00:56:48.571 --> 00:56:52.108
REVIEWED WHERE CAR ACTUALLY-

00:56:52.175 --> 00:56:53.543
MEASURES AND SURVEYS ITS

00:56:53.610 --> 00:56:54.744
PARTICIPANTS ABOUT WHAT

00:56:54.811 --> 00:56:55.745
MOTIVATED THEM TO PURCHASE THE

00:56:55.812 --> 00:56:57.647
VEHICLE. ABOUT HALF OF PEOPLE

00:56:57.714 --> 00:56:58.681
SLIGHTLY SLIGHTLY LESS THAN

00:56:58.748 --> 00:57:00.183
HALF PEOPLE SAY THEY WOULD HAVE

00:57:00.250 --> 00:57:01.184
PURCHASED THE VEHICLE EVEN

00:57:01.251 --> 00:57:03.019
WITHOUT THE CVR PETE REBATE.

00:57:03.086 --> 00:57:05.588
AND SO- WHAT WE WHAT WE NOTED

00:57:05.655 --> 00:57:06.556
HOWEVER IS THAT CARPET DONE

00:57:06.623 --> 00:57:08.191
VERY LITTLE IN THAT PROGRAM OR

00:57:08.258 --> 00:57:09.492
ANY OF ITS OTHER RELATIVES

00:57:09.559 --> 00:57:11.961
RELATED PROGRAMS TO DETERMINE.

00:57:12.028 --> 00:57:14.030
BASICALLY TO DETERMINE WHAT

00:57:14.097 --> 00:57:14.597
THAT MEANS IN TERMS OF THE

00:57:14.664 --> 00:57:16.599
PROGRAM'S EFFICACY AND TO MAKE

00:57:16.666 --> 00:57:17.967
CHANGES TO THE PROGRAM THAT

00:57:18.034 --> 00:57:19.736
WAITING YOU KNOW INCREASED IT'S

00:57:19.803 --> 00:57:21.004
THE EFFECTIVENESS OF MOTIVATING

00:57:21.070 --> 00:57:22.705
CONSUMERS TO DO YOU TAKE A STEP

00:57:22.772 --> 00:57:24.440
THEY WOULDN'T OTHERWISE DO YOU.

00:57:24.507 --> 00:57:25.175
REDUCE THE NUMBER OF WHAT WE

00:57:25.241 --> 00:57:32.816
CALL THE REPORT. THREE RIDERS-

00:57:32.882 --> 00:57:38.555
BUT- THE SO IN ORDER TO EXECUTE

00:57:38.621 --> 00:57:39.322
ARMIES TO BE COLLECTING MORE

00:57:39.389 --> 00:57:40.356
INFORMATION ON NOT JUST AS

00:57:40.423 --> 00:57:41.658
PARTICIPANTS BUT ALSO OTHER

00:57:41.724 --> 00:57:42.625
FACTORS THAT MIGHT DRIVE

00:57:42.692 --> 00:57:45.862
DECISIONS RELATED TO- CONSUMERS

00:57:45.929 --> 00:57:47.096
PURCHASES SUCH AS THESE

00:57:47.163 --> 00:57:49.065
EXTERNAL FACTORS LIGHT FEDERAL

00:57:49.132 --> 00:57:51.534
TAX CREDITS IS IN PREFERENCE

00:57:51.601 --> 00:57:54.137
IT'S BETTER AND SO I'M REALLY

00:57:54.204 --> 00:57:54.804
HAS A LOT OF WORK TO DO IN THAT

00:57:54.871 --> 00:57:57.607
AREA. AND THESE THESE HAVE

00:57:57.674 --> 00:57:58.708
IMPLICATIONS FOR SHORT TERM

00:57:58.775 --> 00:58:00.410
REPORTING IT FOR LONG TERM

00:58:00.476 --> 00:58:01.845
REPORTING ABOUT GHG EMISSIONS

00:58:01.911 --> 00:58:03.613
ON THE SHORT END MISTER

00:58:03.680 --> 00:58:06.950
AUDITOR'S ALLUDED TO AT THE

00:58:07.016 --> 00:58:08.618
BEGINNING. THANK BY SHOULD AND

00:58:08.685 --> 00:58:10.453
VIA THAT PROGRAM PAYS FOR CHIU

00:58:10.520 --> 00:58:12.422
IT'S- EMISSIONS REPORTING TO A

00:58:12.488 --> 00:58:15.158
LEGISLATURE CARBON OVERSTATING.

00:58:15.225 --> 00:58:16.593
THE I. GHG EMISSIONS AND ITS

00:58:16.659 --> 00:58:18.394
PROGRAMS ACHIEVE. AN IN SHORT

00:58:18.461 --> 00:58:20.430
IS TAKING CREDIT FOR CPR BEFORE

00:58:20.496 --> 00:58:22.131
EVERY DEBATE YOU THE ARCHITECT

00:58:22.198 --> 00:58:24.500
IS OUT. WITHOUT TAKING ACCOUNT

00:58:24.567 --> 00:58:25.768
FOR THE INFLUENCE OF THINGS

00:58:25.835 --> 00:58:27.637
LIKE REGULATIONS REQUIRING SALE

00:58:27.704 --> 00:58:28.504
WITHOUT TAKING ACCOUNT FOR

00:58:28.571 --> 00:58:29.873
THINGS LIKE CONSUMER PREFERENCE

00:58:29.939 --> 00:58:34.043
THAT. WOULD HAVE GIVEN THEM TO

00:58:34.110 --> 00:58:34.577
PURCHASE THE VEHICLE EVEN

00:58:34.644 --> 00:58:35.712
WITHOUT CPR. THAT HAS A SHORT

00:58:35.778 --> 00:58:37.213
TERM OF ALSO OBSCURE. THE

00:58:37.280 --> 00:58:38.414
PROGRAM'S COST EFFECTIVENESS

00:58:38.481 --> 00:58:40.250
BECAUSE WHEN THEY'RE TAKING

00:58:40.316 --> 00:58:41.885
CREDIT FOR LARGER AND LARGER

00:58:41.951 --> 00:58:44.254
AMOUNTS OF GHG REDUCTIONS THEM

00:58:44.320 --> 00:58:45.788
BACK SO WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR.

00:58:45.855 --> 00:58:47.090
BOB I MAKE THEM LOOK MORE COST

00:58:47.156 --> 00:58:49.592
EFFECTIVE OR EFFICIENT THAN

00:58:49.659 --> 00:58:50.393
THEY MIGHT IN REALITY. AND

00:58:50.460 --> 00:58:51.628
THESE HAVE LONGER TERM

00:58:51.694 --> 00:58:53.229
CONSEQUENCES IN TERMS OF CARDS.

00:58:53.296 --> 00:58:57.000
ARE USING THESE PROGRAMS YOU-

00:58:57.066 --> 00:58:59.002
GENERATE. BUT STILL

00:58:59.068 --> 00:59:00.770
SUSTAINABILITY IN THE AMONG

00:59:00.837 --> 00:59:02.138
THESE ARE THESE NEW TECHNOLOGY

00:59:02.205 --> 00:59:03.640
VEHICLES SO BRINGING USING

KNOWLEDGE YOUR SPRING CLEAN BUS

00:59:07.610 --> 00:59:09.812
TECHNOLOGY TO THE POINT WHERE

00:59:09.879 --> 00:59:11.180
INCENTIVES ARE NO LONGER NEEDED

00:59:11.247 --> 00:59:12.782
AND THEY CAN BE ON THE FAST

00:59:12.849 --> 00:59:13.716
TRACK TO ACHIEVING THOSE

00:59:13.783 --> 00:59:14.951
OBJECTIVES ABOUT THE PUTTING

00:59:15.018 --> 00:59:17.153
THOSE VEHICLES. OUT THERE ARE

00:59:17.220 --> 00:59:18.087
SHORT TERM AND LONG TERM

00:59:18.154 --> 00:59:20.423
IMPLICATIONS FOR PROGRAM DESIGN

00:59:20.490 --> 00:59:20.890
AND FOR REPORTING THE

00:59:20.957 --> 00:59:25.495
LEGISLATURE. THAT. STEM FROM

00:59:25.561 --> 00:59:26.095
THESE GAPS WERE IDENTIFIED. AS

00:59:26.162 --> 00:59:27.263
A RESULT WE MAKE US YOUR

00:59:27.330 --> 00:59:29.465
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT AS BEEN

00:59:29.532 --> 00:59:31.701
SPENT STATED YOU KNOW FOCUS ON

00:59:31.768 --> 00:59:33.136
IMPROVED DATA COLLECTION%

00:59:33.202 --> 00:59:34.837
APPROVED DATA ANALYSIS SOME OF

00:59:34.904 --> 00:59:36.005
THOSE ARE AS SIMPLE AS

00:59:36.072 --> 00:59:37.140
COORDINATING THE METRICS BEING

00:59:37.206 --> 00:59:39.142
USED. OTHERS ARE RELATIVELY

00:59:39.208 --> 00:59:40.643
SIMPLE IN TERMS OF EXPANDING

00:59:40.710 --> 00:59:42.812
CARDS SURVEY ACTIVITIES AND

00:59:42.879 --> 00:59:44.280
ENSURING THAT IT'S COLLECTING

00:59:44.347 --> 00:59:45.982
INFORMATION FROM PARTICIPANTS

00:59:46.049 --> 00:59:47.016
WERE ALREADY YOU KNOW WILLING

00:59:47.083 --> 00:59:48.117
PARTICIPANTS RECEIVING A

00:59:48.184 --> 00:59:49.585
FINANCIAL BENEFIT FROM THE

00:59:49.652 --> 00:59:51.354
PROGRAM. AND THEN YOU KNOW

00:59:51.421 --> 00:59:52.922
USING THOSE IN THAT INFORMATION

00:59:52.989 --> 00:59:54.791
ABOUT BEHAVIOR ABOUT THE

00:59:54.857 --> 00:59:56.492
REGULATORY PROGRAMS IMPACT. ON

00:59:56.559 --> 00:59:58.528
AN INTERIM BASIS IMPROVE THE

00:59:58.594 --> 01:00:00.997
MEASUREMENT OF THE PROGRAM'S

01:00:01.064 --> 01:00:02.932
GHG EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS IN

01:00:02.999 --> 01:00:04.667
REPORTS THE LEGISLATURE AND

01:00:04.734 --> 01:00:05.768
BECAUSE WE EXPECT THAT TO

01:00:05.835 --> 01:00:07.704
CONTINUE TO POTENTIALLY BE AN

01:00:07.770 --> 01:00:09.505
ONGOING PROCESS. IT ALSO

01:00:09.572 --> 01:00:10.840
RECOMMENDED THAT CAR KEEP IT

01:00:10.907 --> 01:00:11.975
SUPPORT IN THE LEGISLATURE

01:00:12.041 --> 01:00:14.444
APPRAISE ITS PROGRESS WHERE IS

01:00:14.510 --> 01:00:15.578
IT ABLE TO IDENTIFY THIS

01:00:15.645 --> 01:00:17.013
INFORMATION IS HAVING PROBLEMS

01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:18.481
COLLECTING SOME INFORMATION.

01:00:18.548 --> 01:00:20.249
THAT WAY THE LEGISLATURE HAS

01:00:20.316 --> 01:00:21.384
MORE TRANSPARENCY ABOUT THE

01:00:21.451 --> 01:00:22.852
RELIABILITY OF THE TOOLS IT'S

01:00:22.919 --> 01:00:24.354
USING TO ALLOCATE THIS MONEY

01:00:24.420 --> 01:00:25.888
THIS MONEY EVERY YEAR AND CAN

01:00:25.955 --> 01:00:27.156
POTENTIAL YOU KNOW PROVIDE

01:00:27.223 --> 01:00:29.125
ASSISTANCE TO OUR- GIFT CARD IS

01:00:29.192 --> 01:00:29.525
RUNNING UP AGAINST

01:00:29.592 --> 01:00:31.361
ADMINISTRATIVE OTHER HURDLES.

01:00:31.427 --> 01:00:36.466
IN PERFORMING IN PERFORMING-

01:00:36.532 --> 01:00:37.533
DISTANT ENHANCED MUCH. SO THE

01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:38.234
LAST AREA I'LL SPEAK ABOUT

01:00:38.301 --> 01:00:40.737
TODAY HAS TO DO WITH- THE

01:00:40.803 --> 01:00:42.305
SOCIAL ECONOMICAL ASSOCIATE

01:00:42.372 --> 01:00:44.974
WITH SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS. AS

01:00:45.041 --> 01:00:45.942
BEEN STATED THERE ARE SOME

01:00:46.009 --> 01:00:47.810
BROAD GOALS THAT CAN PERTAIN TO

01:00:47.877 --> 01:00:49.212
THE ENTIRETY OF THE CAP AND

01:00:49.278 --> 01:00:50.613
TRADE'S FUNDED PROGRAMS IN THE

01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:52.281
STATE BUDGET PERTAIN TO THINGS

01:00:52.348 --> 01:00:54.550
LIKE JOB CREATION AND THE ON

01:00:54.617 --> 01:00:55.485
THE THIRD DISADVANTAGED

01:00:55.551 --> 01:00:57.153
COMMUNITY AND LOW INCOME AND

01:00:57.220 --> 01:00:58.521
MIDDLE INCOME FROM ANY EXCUSE

01:00:58.588 --> 01:01:01.591
ME. SENDING REQUIREMENTS THAT-

01:01:01.657 --> 01:01:03.559
THAT HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED-

01:01:03.626 --> 01:01:05.028
HOWEVER THERE ARE ALSO VERY

01:01:05.094 --> 01:01:07.764
SPECIFIC PROGRAM- GOALS THAT

01:01:07.830 --> 01:01:09.365
CARP HAS DEMONSTRATED OR HAS

01:01:09.432 --> 01:01:11.134
RATHER- CLEAN FOR ITS PROGRAMS

01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:12.935
THAT RELATE TO THINGS LIKE

01:01:13.002 --> 01:01:14.404
INCREASING PARTICIPANTS CREDIT

01:01:14.470 --> 01:01:15.571
SCORES THE STATE AUDITOR

01:01:15.638 --> 01:01:17.473
SUMMARIED IN HER REMARKS. BY

01:01:17.540 --> 01:01:18.975
ENABLING PARTICIPANTS TO TRAVEL

01:01:19.042 --> 01:01:20.109
OUTSIDE OF THEIR COMMUNITIES

01:01:20.176 --> 01:01:21.344
BECAUSE NOW THEY HAVE ACCESS TO

01:01:21.411 --> 01:01:23.446
A RIDESHARE PROGRAM ALLOW THEM

01:01:23.513 --> 01:01:25.314
TO GET TO DOCTORS APPOINTMENTS

01:01:25.381 --> 01:01:29.052
OR GROCERY. STORE THEY COULDN'T

01:01:29.118 --> 01:01:29.685
PREVIOUSLY ACCESS. EVEN CLAIMS

01:01:29.752 --> 01:01:31.454
A MAXIMIZE. YOU KNOW PROBABLY

01:01:31.521 --> 01:01:32.722
MAXIMIZING PARTICIPANTS

01:01:32.789 --> 01:01:34.290
ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES BECAUSE

01:01:34.357 --> 01:01:35.892
NOW THEY HAVE A MORE RELIABLE

01:01:35.958 --> 01:01:37.226
LESS EXPENSIVE SOURCE OF

01:01:37.293 --> 01:01:39.328
TRANSPORTATION. I CAN GET THEM

01:01:39.395 --> 01:01:40.396
TO TWO JOBS THEY CAN OTHERWISE

01:01:40.463 --> 01:01:41.697
WORKING GET THEM GET THEM

01:01:41.764 --> 01:01:44.467
THEY'RE RELIABLY. HOWEVER WHEN

01:01:44.534 --> 01:01:45.368
WE LOOK AT WHAT CARD IS

01:01:45.435 --> 01:01:46.335
ACTUALLY MEASURING AND

01:01:46.402 --> 01:01:48.204
REPORTING IT REALLY IS JUST

01:01:48.271 --> 01:01:49.205
LIMITED TO THOSE LEGALLY

01:01:49.272 --> 01:01:51.574
REQUIRED DOLLAR SPENDING AND

01:01:51.641 --> 01:01:53.376
DISADVANTAGED LONG. MINUTES

01:01:53.443 --> 01:01:54.777
NORTHERN PARDON METRICS BUT

01:01:54.844 --> 01:01:55.611
THEY'RE AT THE PROBABLY THE

01:01:55.678 --> 01:01:57.346
HIGHEST LEVEL YOU KNOW THE

01:01:57.413 --> 01:01:58.748
BROADEST LEVEL OF DETAIL THAT

01:01:58.815 --> 01:02:00.450
CAR COULD POSSIBLY BE REPORTING

01:02:00.516 --> 01:02:02.485
IN SOME OF THESE AREAS. AND SO

01:02:02.552 --> 01:02:04.420
WHEN OUR TEAM WENT TO FIGURE

01:02:04.487 --> 01:02:05.488
OUT WHAT WAS HAPPENING BETWEEN

01:02:05.555 --> 01:02:07.056
THIS GAP ABOUT THE BENEFITS

01:02:07.123 --> 01:02:08.624
THESE PROGRAMS ARE SUPPOSED TO

01:02:08.691 --> 01:02:09.826
CONFER. AND WHAT'S ACTUALLY

01:02:09.892 --> 01:02:12.128
COMING OUT OF CAR. WE FOUND

01:02:12.195 --> 01:02:14.730
THAT THERE ARE TWO BASIC

01:02:14.797 --> 01:02:15.364
REASONS WHY THIS IS A CURRENT.

01:02:15.431 --> 01:02:16.666
THE FIRST IS THAT CAR MIGHT NOT

01:02:16.732 --> 01:02:17.767
JUST. IT MIGHT NOT BE

01:02:17.834 --> 01:02:19.102
COLLECTING THE DATA IN NEEDS TO

01:02:19.168 --> 01:02:20.803
BE RESPONSIVE TO THE INTENTION

01:02:20.870 --> 01:02:22.138
OF THE PROGRAM. THAT'S

01:02:22.205 --> 01:02:23.406
CERTAINLY TRUE OF WHAT THE

01:02:23.473 --> 01:02:24.674
STATE HONOREE FOR TWO REGARDING

01:02:24.740 --> 01:02:27.443
THE LOAN REPAYMENT NUMBERS FOR

01:02:27.510 --> 01:02:29.345
ITS FINANCING SYSTEM PROGRAM.

01:02:29.412 --> 01:02:30.613
WE ASKED WHY CAR CAN'T MEASURE

01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:32.148
THE LOAN REPAYMENT IN ORDER TO

01:02:32.215 --> 01:02:34.083
JUSTIFY WERE TO BACK UP ITS

01:02:34.150 --> 01:02:35.151
CLAIMS ABOUT INCREASED CREDIT

01:02:35.218 --> 01:02:36.853
SCORES. HARPALUS WELL THEY

01:02:36.919 --> 01:02:38.121
DON'T THEY DON'T CONTROL THE

01:02:38.187 --> 01:02:40.223
LOANS THEMSELVES. SO AS A

01:02:40.289 --> 01:02:42.291
RESULT THEY DON'T KNOW WHETHER-

01:02:42.358 --> 01:02:44.360
PARTICIPANTS ARE ASKED TO BE

01:02:44.427 --> 01:02:45.828
PAYING OFF ONE. NO WE WOULD

01:02:45.895 --> 01:02:46.462
OBVIOUSLY ENCOURAGE CARPET DO

01:02:46.529 --> 01:02:48.131
WHATEVER IT COULD TO ACCESS

01:02:48.197 --> 01:02:49.398
THAT INFORMATION THROUGH ONE OF

01:02:49.465 --> 01:02:50.666
ITS THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATORS

01:02:50.733 --> 01:02:51.434
ARE YOU KNOW USING ITS

01:02:51.501 --> 01:02:52.768
AUTHORITY. OR LOOK FOR REMEDIES

01:02:52.835 --> 01:02:54.403
TO DO SO IN ANOTHER WAY WITH

01:02:54.470 --> 01:02:55.404
THE HELP OF THE LEGISLATURE

01:02:55.471 --> 01:02:57.206
WHAT HAVE YOU. THAT MINIMUM WE

01:02:57.273 --> 01:02:58.708
WOULD NOT EXPECT HARD TO DESIGN

01:02:58.774 --> 01:03:01.210
A PROGRAM AND MAKE CLAIMS ABOUT

01:03:01.277 --> 01:03:04.013
THAT PROGRAMS I THINK YOU SEE

01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:05.548
THAT CAN'T BACK UP. WITH THAT.

01:03:05.615 --> 01:03:06.816
ON THE OTHER HAND. THERE ARE

01:03:06.883 --> 01:03:07.984
SITUATIONS IN WHICH CARP

01:03:08.050 --> 01:03:09.952
HAPPIER LATELY HAS ACCESS TO IT

01:03:10.019 --> 01:03:11.154
YOU COULD BE USING TO MEASURE

01:03:11.220 --> 01:03:12.922
AND REPORT IS PROGRAMS BUT IT

01:03:12.989 --> 01:03:15.191
JUST HASN'T DONE SO. I EXAMPLE

01:03:15.258 --> 01:03:16.626
THERE HAS TO DO WITH ITS CLEAN

01:03:16.692 --> 01:03:18.895
CARS FOR ALL PROGRAM- THAT

01:03:18.961 --> 01:03:21.197
PROGRAM- PAYS PAYS. FOLKS TO

01:03:21.264 --> 01:03:23.566
SCRAP OLD INEFFICIENT VEHICLES

01:03:23.633 --> 01:03:24.433
TO REPLACE THEM WITH WITH NEWER

01:03:24.500 --> 01:03:26.903
USED. VEHICLES INCLUDING SATURN

01:03:26.969 --> 01:03:28.638
HYBRID VEHICLES. AND PART OF

01:03:28.704 --> 01:03:30.673
THE ASSUMPTION THAT PROGRAM IS.

01:03:30.740 --> 01:03:31.941
NOW THIS INDIVIDUAL HAS A MORE

01:03:32.008 --> 01:03:32.708
RELIABLE SOURCE OF

01:03:32.775 --> 01:03:33.876
TRANSPORTATION NOW THEY'RE

01:03:33.943 --> 01:03:35.711
GONNA BE ABLE TO GET TO JOBS

01:03:35.778 --> 01:03:37.313
AND JOB INTERVIEWS. WITH THIS

01:03:37.380 --> 01:03:38.748
YEAR FINANCIAL BENEFIT TO THEM.

01:03:38.814 --> 01:03:40.249
THAT'S THAT'S GOOD BEYOND THE

01:03:40.316 --> 01:03:41.450
SECOND OR THIRD ORDER BEYOND

01:03:41.517 --> 01:03:45.188
JUST PROVIDING. THEM YOU ACCESS

01:03:45.254 --> 01:03:46.088
TO A VEHICLE SO. HI RECOGNIZED

01:03:46.155 --> 01:03:47.590
WE KNOW TO BE NOTE BECAUSE NOT

01:03:47.657 --> 01:03:48.391
ONLY DOES IT MAKE THE CLAIM

01:03:48.457 --> 01:03:49.392
THAT THIS IS THE PROGRAM'S

01:03:49.458 --> 01:03:52.161
INTENT. BUT IT DESIGNED A

01:03:52.228 --> 01:03:53.062
FOURTEEN DIFFERENT OCCASIONS

01:03:53.129 --> 01:03:54.497
WHEN ENTERING INTO CONTRACTS

01:03:54.564 --> 01:03:55.898
WITH LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS. IT

01:03:55.965 --> 01:03:57.767
DESIGN SAMPLE SURVEY QUESTIONS

01:03:57.833 --> 01:03:58.467
THAT TRYING TO GET AT THESE

01:03:58.534 --> 01:04:00.603
VERY ISSUES. HOW MUCH HOW HOW

01:04:00.670 --> 01:04:01.604
HAS YOUR INCOME CHANGED SINCE

01:04:01.671 --> 01:04:03.272
YOU'VE GOTTEN YOUR VEHICLE HOW

01:04:03.339 --> 01:04:04.941
LIABLE AS YOUR NEW VEHICLE HOW

01:04:05.007 --> 01:04:05.975
MUCH DOES IT COST YOU TO

01:04:06.042 --> 01:04:07.109
MAINTAIN YOUR NEW VEHICLE IS

01:04:07.176 --> 01:04:08.244
THATMORE OR LESS THAN USED.

01:04:08.311 --> 01:04:09.679
RIGHT RUSSIANS ARE VERY

01:04:09.745 --> 01:04:11.614
PERTINENT TO BE BIG THE I YOU

01:04:11.681 --> 01:04:13.416
KNOW THE THEORY BEHIND THE

01:04:13.482 --> 01:04:14.984
PROGRAM'S SECOND THIRD LEVEL

01:04:15.051 --> 01:04:17.587
BENEFITS. HOWEVER WE WANT TO

01:04:17.653 --> 01:04:19.055
LOOK AT THAT SURVEY DATA WE

01:04:19.121 --> 01:04:19.622
FOUND CRIME ISN'T ACTUALLY

01:04:19.689 --> 01:04:22.325
COLLECTED. AND NO AND NO AND

01:04:22.391 --> 01:04:23.993
NOT ONLY DO THEY NOT COLLECTED

01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:24.860
BUT THEY DON'T ACTUALLY

01:04:24.927 --> 01:04:27.029
REQUIRE. THEIR DISTRICTS TO ASK

01:04:27.096 --> 01:04:28.764
THOSE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS SO

01:04:28.831 --> 01:04:30.032
KARMAZIN KNOW WHAT QUESTIONS

01:04:30.099 --> 01:04:31.067
THEY ARE DISTRICT IS ACTUALLY

01:04:31.133 --> 01:04:32.835
ASKING. THOSE QUESTIONS ABOUT

01:04:32.902 --> 01:04:34.503
SOME UNRELATED QUESTIONS IT'S A

01:04:34.570 --> 01:04:37.807
MIX OF QUESTIONS- SO. FAR MAY

01:04:37.873 --> 01:04:39.275
HAVE A TROVE OF VERY USEFUL

01:04:39.342 --> 01:04:40.676
DATA CENTER MAY HAVE SOMETHING

01:04:40.743 --> 01:04:42.278
THAT'S COMPLETELY UNUSABLE YOU

01:04:42.345 --> 01:04:46.749
KNOW SEVERAL YEARS. INTO THIS

01:04:46.816 --> 01:04:48.584
PROJECT. SO CAN TO CONNECT THE

01:04:48.651 --> 01:04:49.819
TENER DRESSED BE. THIS OF

01:04:49.885 --> 01:04:50.853
ISSUES BY. WE PUT TOGETHER WE

01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:52.054
THINK ARE PRETTY CALM. SET OF

01:04:52.121 --> 01:04:53.222
RECOMMENDATIONS OF MISTRUST IN

01:04:53.289 --> 01:04:56.859
THE LEFT SIDE. THOSE INCLUDE.

01:04:56.926 --> 01:04:58.628
ARE GOING THROUGH AND- DOESN'T.

01:04:58.694 --> 01:05:01.397
RICHARDS IT EXPECTS TO OPT.

01:05:01.464 --> 01:05:03.666
THESE THAT ARTICLE JUST GO BE

01:05:03.733 --> 01:05:05.901
GHG REDUCTIONS THAT'S IMPORTANT

01:05:05.968 --> 01:05:07.069
BECAUSE IT'S AN IMPORTANT PIECE

01:05:07.136 --> 01:05:09.071
OF TRANSPARENCY. TO ALLOW

01:05:09.138 --> 01:05:10.506
PARTICIPANTS AND THAT AND

01:05:10.573 --> 01:05:11.607
STAKEHOLDERS IN THE LEGISLATURE

01:05:11.674 --> 01:05:13.643

THESE PROGRAMS BUT IT'S ALSO

01:05:14.910 --> 01:05:16.412
IMPORTANT FROM ACCOUNTABILITY

01:05:16.479 --> 01:05:17.480
STANDPOINT BECAUSE THESE

01:05:17.546 --> 01:05:18.614
PROGRAMS. IT COSTS

01:05:18.681 --> 01:05:21.484
SIGNIFICANTLY MORE TO OPERATE.

01:05:21.550 --> 01:05:22.485
THE FINANCING ASSISTANCE

01:05:22.551 --> 01:05:24.086
PROGRAM COSTS ABOUT SEVEN TIMES

01:05:24.153 --> 01:05:25.888
AS MUCH TO REDUCE ONE TONNE OF

01:05:25.955 --> 01:05:27.823
GHGS SOMETHING LIKE. T. V. R.

01:05:27.890 --> 01:05:29.458
P. AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS

01:05:29.525 --> 01:05:31.093
THERE'S A LOT MORE INVESTMENT

01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:32.228
AND NOT JUST THE FINANCIAL

01:05:32.295 --> 01:05:35.364

01:05:35.431 --> 01:05:37.500
PARTICIPANTS- YOU KNOW THERE'S

01:05:37.566 --> 01:05:38.434
HIGHLIGHTED LARGE STAFFING

01:05:38.501 --> 01:05:40.536
COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH. WALKING

01:05:40.603 --> 01:05:41.437
PARTICIPANTS THROUGH THE LOAN

01:05:41.504 --> 01:05:42.605
PROCESS COACH YOU ABOUT

01:05:42.672 --> 01:05:44.473
FINANCIAL LITERACY BUT AS I'VE

01:05:44.540 --> 01:05:45.908
ALLUDED TO ALREADY THAT'S KIND

01:05:45.975 --> 01:05:47.810
OF WHERE THE INVESTMENT STOPS

01:05:47.877 --> 01:05:48.577
AND WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER THAT

01:05:48.644 --> 01:05:50.079
WAS. A SIZEABLE DOLLAR

01:05:50.146 --> 01:05:51.647
INVESTMENTS ARE ACTUALLY PAYING

01:05:51.714 --> 01:05:56.719
OFF. LIKE OUR STUDENTS.

01:05:56.786 --> 01:05:57.386
OBVIOUSLY THE WE WOULD LIKE

01:05:57.453 --> 01:05:59.255
CALL TWO GO USE THAT THAT. AND

01:05:59.322 --> 01:06:01.057
MAKE SURE THAT MADE METRICS

01:06:01.123 --> 01:06:03.592
WITH USABLE DATA. THAT CAN THAT

01:06:03.659 --> 01:06:04.994
CAN BE USED TO REPORT TO THE

01:06:05.061 --> 01:06:07.396
LEGISLATURE AND TO EXPORT ON.

01:06:07.463 --> 01:06:08.364
YOU KNOW WHETHER PROGRAMS ARE

01:06:08.431 --> 01:06:10.099
ACTUALLY WORKING AS A BASE TO

01:06:10.166 --> 01:06:10.833
MAKE YOU BASED ON THE LOGIC

01:06:10.900 --> 01:06:12.768
MODELS AND CREATIVE. AND

01:06:12.835 --> 01:06:14.337
FINALLY USE THAT INFORMATION TO

01:06:14.403 --> 01:06:15.905
RECOMMEND HAS ALREADY BEEN

01:06:15.971 --> 01:06:17.506
ALLUDED TO IN THIS DISCUSSION.

01:06:17.573 --> 01:06:19.275
THIS PROGRAM IS REALLY WORKING

01:06:19.342 --> 01:06:20.376
IT'S REALLY PAYING OFF IN TERMS

01:06:20.443 --> 01:06:21.844
OF THE SOCIOECONOMIC SIDE IT'S

01:06:21.911 --> 01:06:22.978
WORTH THE ADDED INVESTMENT

01:06:23.045 --> 01:06:24.714
VERSES. WE NEED TO TREAT THIS

01:06:24.780 --> 01:06:26.482
OTHER PROGRAM WE NEED TO WE

THESE TYPES OF BENEFITS ARE

01:06:28.884 --> 01:06:30.252
ACTUALLY REASONABLE TO EXPECT

01:06:30.319 --> 01:06:31.921
MUCH TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM.

01:06:31.987 --> 01:06:35.725

WERE TALKING ABOUT- WHAT WAS

01:07:40.055 --> 01:07:41.724
THE REASON WHY CARVE- DID NOT

01:07:41.791 --> 01:07:43.592
FOLLOW THESE GUIDELINES THAT

01:07:43.659 --> 01:07:45.027
WERE OUTLINED BACK IN TWENTY

01:07:45.094 --> 01:07:46.729
FIFTEEN. YOU KNOW WHAT DID THEY

01:07:46.796 --> 01:07:48.731
SAY AS A REASON WHY THEY DIDN'T

01:07:48.798 --> 01:07:52.468
DO THIS. THEY PROVIDED US TWO

01:07:52.535 --> 01:07:55.438
REASONS MISTER SALAS ONE WAS.

01:07:55.504 --> 01:07:56.972
THE COMPLEXITY THE TECHNICAL

01:07:57.039 --> 01:07:59.074
COMPLEXITY INVOLVED IN

01:07:59.141 --> 01:08:00.709
DEVELOPING A WAY TO MEASURE JOB

01:08:00.776 --> 01:08:02.778
CREATION AS A FUNCTION OF THE

01:08:02.845 --> 01:08:03.345
INVESTMENT ITS PROGRAMS ARE

01:08:03.412 --> 01:08:06.715
MAKING HOWEVER WE KNOW WE'VE

01:08:06.782 --> 01:08:08.350
GOT THAT IN OUR TEXT BY SAYING

01:08:08.417 --> 01:08:10.319
WHAT THEY ULTIMATELY SETTLED ON

01:08:10.386 --> 01:08:11.387
WAS A FAIRLY STANDARD AND

01:08:11.454 --> 01:08:14.690
WIDELY USE INPUT OUTPUT- MODEL

01:08:14.757 --> 01:08:16.559
THAT HAS BEEN USED IN THIS AREA

01:08:16.625 --> 01:08:18.527
FOR A LONG TIME SO- WE DON'T

01:08:18.594 --> 01:08:19.962
BELIEVE THAT THE YOU KNOW THE

01:08:20.029 --> 01:08:21.263
TECHNICAL COMPLEXITY WAS REALLY

01:08:21.330 --> 01:08:22.865
A LIMITING FACTOR IN THEIR

01:08:22.932 --> 01:08:25.067
ABILITY TO ROLL THIS OUT- THE

01:08:25.134 --> 01:08:25.935
OTHER ISSUE THAT THEY- WANTED

01:08:26.001 --> 01:08:28.037
TO. IS THESE GRANT AGREEMENTS I

01:08:28.103 --> 01:08:29.238
WOULD ADD TO THAT BUT THEY

01:08:29.305 --> 01:08:30.906
ENTER INTO WITH THE THIRD

01:08:30.973 --> 01:08:32.274
PARTIES THAT ADMINISTER A LOT

01:08:32.341 --> 01:08:34.376
OF THESE PROGRAMS IN THE FIELD

01:08:34.443 --> 01:08:35.911
AND THEY HAD SAID WELL BASED ON

01:08:35.978 --> 01:08:36.912
THE TIMING OF SOME OF THESE

01:08:36.979 --> 01:08:38.814
AGREEMENTS WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE

01:08:38.881 --> 01:08:40.449
TO IN INSERT REQUIREMENTS INTO

01:08:40.516 --> 01:08:42.785
THESE AGREEMENTS THAT COMPEL

01:08:42.852 --> 01:08:44.720
THE ADMINISTRATORS TO REPORT

01:08:49.291 --> 01:08:51.026
KNOW NOT ONLY HOW MANY OF THESE

01:08:51.093 --> 01:08:56.232
AGREEMENTS ENTERED INTO POST.

01:08:56.298 --> 01:08:57.199
TWENTY FIFTEEN BUT THAT. I'M

01:08:57.266 --> 01:08:57.800

EXTENDING TIME EXTENDING DOLLAR

01:09:03.105 --> 01:09:04.840
AMOUNTS AND SO FORTH SO WE

01:09:04.907 --> 01:09:06.342
STRONGLY ENCOURAGE CARP TO

01:09:14.783 --> 01:09:16.485
ANALYSIS FOR US SO THAT WE CAN

REMEDIES YEAH. THANK YOU SO. TO

01:09:30.566 --> 01:09:31.500
THE FIRST POINT THE TECHNICAL

01:09:31.567 --> 01:09:33.502
COMPLEXITY YOU'RE SAYING- YOU

01:09:33.569 --> 01:09:34.737
BELIEVE THEY CAN STILL PROVIDED

01:09:34.803 --> 01:09:36.205
THAT INFORMATION IN TO THE

01:09:36.272 --> 01:09:39.108
SECOND POINT- WHEN THEY AMENDED

01:09:39.174 --> 01:09:39.875
ALL THE THIRD PARTY

01:09:39.942 --> 01:09:41.143
ADMINISTERED CONTRACTS THEY

01:09:41.210 --> 01:09:42.745
COULD ADD AN AMENDMENT IN THERE

01:09:42.811 --> 01:09:45.314
TO ACTUALLY BUILD IN THE DATA

01:09:45.381 --> 01:09:47.016
THAT WAS REQUIRED. UNDER

01:09:47.082 --> 01:09:51.020
LEGISLATION. CORRECT HELLO OKAY

01:09:51.086 --> 01:09:52.254
I WANTED TO ASK ABOUT ONE OF

01:09:52.321 --> 01:09:53.556
THE INCENTIVE PROGRAMS THAT YOU

01:09:53.622 --> 01:09:55.391
GUYS TALKED ABOUT IN THE REPORT

01:09:55.457 --> 01:09:57.026
AB AND THAT'S THE CLEAN VEHICLE

01:09:57.092 --> 01:09:58.727
REBATE PROGRAM THE CVR P.

01:09:58.794 --> 01:10:00.563
PROGRAM WHICH YOU KNOW IS THE

01:10:00.629 --> 01:10:01.664
SME WAY PROGRAM THAT ALLOWS

01:10:01.730 --> 01:10:03.198
CONSUMERS TO APPLY FOR REBATES

01:10:03.265 --> 01:10:04.466
IF THEY PURCHASED BATTERY

01:10:04.533 --> 01:10:05.634
ELECTRIC VEHICLES HYDROGEN

01:10:05.701 --> 01:10:07.369
FUELED ELECTRIC VEHICLES OR

01:10:07.436 --> 01:10:09.438
PLUG IN HYBRID ELECTRIC LIGHT

01:10:09.505 --> 01:10:10.873
DUTY VEHICLES ARE ZERO

01:10:10.940 --> 01:10:12.975
EMISSION- MOTORCYCLES AND WHEN

01:10:13.042 --> 01:10:14.076
I LOOKED AT THE REPORTER WAS

01:10:14.143 --> 01:10:16.378
NEARLY ONE BILLION IN CAPITAL

01:10:16.445 --> 01:10:16.979
RATE FUND THAT HAVE BEEN SPENT

01:10:17.046 --> 01:10:19.582
ON THE PROGRAM. WHEN YOU LOOK

01:10:19.648 --> 01:10:21.183
AT THAT. WHAT PERCENTAGE WAS

01:10:21.250 --> 01:10:22.618
ACTUALLY SPENT AND

01:10:22.685 --> 01:10:25.821
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. SURE

01:10:25.888 --> 01:10:27.523
THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION- WE

01:10:27.590 --> 01:10:28.824
DON'T WE DON'T HAVE THAT NUMBER

01:10:28.891 --> 01:10:30.893
OVER THE LIFE OF THE PROGRAM

01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:31.927
ONE ONE REASON FOR THAT IS THAT

01:10:31.994 --> 01:10:33.696
THE PROGRAM ACTUALLY PREDATES

01:10:33.762 --> 01:10:35.598
THE REQUIREMENT IN STATE LAW SO

01:10:35.664 --> 01:10:36.732
IT PREDATES THE LEGISLATION

01:10:36.799 --> 01:10:38.434
THAT THAT PUT THOSE THAT

01:10:38.500 --> 01:10:40.302
CREATED THE AC I DISADVANTAGED

01:10:40.369 --> 01:10:41.003
COMMUNITIES AND LOW INCOME

01:10:41.070 --> 01:10:43.706
COMMUNITIES- SO WHAT I CAN TELL

01:10:43.772 --> 01:10:45.808
YOU THAT IN RECENT YEARS- THOSE

01:10:45.874 --> 01:10:47.142
NUMBERS HAVE BEEN RELATIVELY

01:10:47.209 --> 01:10:48.544
LOW COMPARED TO SOME OF THE

01:10:48.611 --> 01:10:50.779
OTHER PROGRAMS CARVE OPERATES.

01:10:50.846 --> 01:10:53.082
I BELIEVE IN TWENTY NINETEEN TO

FOR YOUR ACCOUNT YOUR TWENTY

01:10:54.516 --> 01:10:55.584
NINETEEN JUST THE MOST RECENT

01:10:55.651 --> 01:10:56.218
YEAR ON WHICH CAR WAS REPORTED

01:10:56.285 --> 01:10:59.355
THAT THE RP WAS AROUND TEN OR

01:10:59.421 --> 01:11:01.457
11% IN SPENDING IS A PASSIONATE

01:11:01.523 --> 01:11:03.425
SPENDING WHEREAS SOME OTHER

01:11:03.492 --> 01:11:05.294
PROGRAMS LIKE THE- TRUCK AND

01:11:05.361 --> 01:11:06.495
BUS ABOUT YOUR PROGRAM WERE

01:11:06.562 --> 01:11:09.031
MUCH MUCH HIGHER AROUND FORTY

01:11:09.098 --> 01:11:10.799
OR EVEN UP TO FIFTY PERCENT-

01:11:10.866 --> 01:11:12.968
AND THEN I'D ALSO NOTE THAT IN

01:11:13.035 --> 01:11:14.570
PREVIOUS YEARS OUR CAR WAS WAS

01:11:14.637 --> 01:11:16.739
REPORTING. A LARGER POOL OF

01:11:16.805 --> 01:11:18.607
CTRP SPENDING IN THOSE

01:11:18.674 --> 01:11:20.409
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES

01:11:20.476 --> 01:11:22.177
HOWEVER THAT WAS UNDER A

01:11:22.244 --> 01:11:24.647
PREVIOUS- VERSION OF THE LAW

01:11:24.713 --> 01:11:26.715
AND THE KINDS FROM CATTLE YEAH

01:11:26.782 --> 01:11:29.485
ALLOWED PARDON OTHER AGENCIES

01:11:29.551 --> 01:11:30.953
TO TAKE CREDIT FOR SPENDING

01:11:31.020 --> 01:11:32.454
THAT DIDN'T TAKE PLACE DIRECTLY

01:11:32.521 --> 01:11:33.455
INSIDE DISADVANTAGED

01:11:33.522 --> 01:11:35.658
COMMUNITIES BUT RATHER IN A IN

01:11:35.724 --> 01:11:36.659

FROM FROM THE INVESTMENT

01:11:41.196 --> 01:11:44.033

I AM TWENTY- TWENTY SIXTEEN

01:11:47.069 --> 01:11:48.404
CAME THROUGH AND SAID NO WE

01:11:48.470 --> 01:11:50.506
DEFINITELY WANT TO FOCUS THE

01:11:50.572 --> 01:11:52.074
SPENDING IN THE DISADVANTAGED

01:11:52.141 --> 01:11:53.175
COMMUNITIES THEMSELVES THAT'S

01:11:53.242 --> 01:11:54.877
WE WANT TO SEE THE BENEFITS BUT

01:11:54.943 --> 01:11:56.845
NCPR PIECE CASE THAT THAT SEEMS

01:11:56.912 --> 01:11:57.880
TO HAVE COINCIDED WITH THAT A

01:11:57.946 --> 01:11:59.581
PRETTY MARKET REDUCTION IN THE

01:11:59.648 --> 01:12:01.317
NUMBER OF DOLLARS BEING SPENT

01:12:01.383 --> 01:12:03.519
INTO MANAGEMENT. CON THANK YOU

01:12:03.585 --> 01:12:05.054
AND I DON'T HAVE MY STAFF- PULL

01:12:05.120 --> 01:12:06.622
UP SOME OF THE NUMBERS AND I

01:12:06.689 --> 01:12:09.258
KNOW FROM TWENTY SIXTEEN AND

01:12:09.324 --> 01:12:11.193
THE CV RP THE REBATE PROGRAM-

01:12:11.260 --> 01:12:13.262
MORE THAN 80% WHICH WAS THIRTY

01:12:13.328 --> 01:12:15.898
FOUR MILLION DOLLARS WAS SPENT.

01:12:15.964 --> 01:12:17.466
OUTSIDE OF THE DISADVANTAGED

01:12:17.533 --> 01:12:19.134
COMMUNITIES AND SO I JUST

01:12:19.201 --> 01:12:20.335
WANTED TO ASK TO SEE IF YOU HAD

01:12:20.402 --> 01:12:21.670
LOOKED AT THAT SPECIFICALLY IF

01:12:21.737 --> 01:12:29.011
NOT THAT WE CAN MAKE. SURE

01:12:29.078 --> 01:12:29.578
WE'RE ASKING CARP WHEN THEY

01:12:29.645 --> 01:12:30.312
COME UP AFTER. AND I JUST I

01:12:30.379 --> 01:12:31.580
WOULD NOTE SIR THAT THAT THAT

01:12:31.647 --> 01:12:32.815
HE PERCENT AS I. OVER THERE

01:12:32.881 --> 01:12:35.150
DISTANT COMMUNITY SPENDING SO.

01:12:35.217 --> 01:12:35.684
THEY THEY CLAIM FORTY TWO

01:12:35.751 --> 01:12:36.552
MILLION JUST ABOUT WHEN USED.

01:12:36.618 --> 01:12:37.953
IN EIGHTY PER OF ACTIVE PLACE

01:12:38.020 --> 01:12:38.987
OUTSIDE. OF THE DISK MANAGEMENT

01:12:39.054 --> 01:12:41.223
AND SELF SO. IT'S A LITTLE EVEN

01:12:41.290 --> 01:12:43.192
MORE NOTABLE THAN THANK YOU

01:12:43.258 --> 01:12:44.026
HAVE GOT IT SOME OF THE FORTY

01:12:44.093 --> 01:12:45.060
TWO MILLION THAT THEY WERE

01:12:45.127 --> 01:12:45.694
SUPPOSED TO SPEND IN A

01:12:45.761 --> 01:12:47.429
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY 80% OF

01:12:47.496 --> 01:12:48.630
THAT WAS SPENT OUTSIDE OF A

01:12:48.697 --> 01:12:51.133
DSADVANTAGED COMMUNITY. OF

01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:51.834
THAT POCKET OF MONEY. THAT'S

01:12:51.900 --> 01:12:54.603
WHAT I GOT IT. YES SIR. OKAY

01:12:54.670 --> 01:12:56.638
AND THEN YOU HAD MENTIONED- AND

01:12:56.705 --> 01:12:58.774
MISSILE ALSO TALKED ABOUT IT.

01:12:58.841 --> 01:13:00.642
BUT THE OVERLAP IN THE%

01:13:00.709 --> 01:13:04.780
PROGRAMS. AB DID THEY IS WAS

01:13:04.847 --> 01:13:05.681
THERE ANY METRIC THAT CARD

01:13:05.748 --> 01:13:09.017
PROVIDED TO ADJUST FOR THE

01:13:09.084 --> 01:13:09.885
OVERLAP IN THE PROGRAMS THAT

01:13:09.952 --> 01:13:11.186
YOU GUYS WERE WE TALKED ABOUT

01:13:11.253 --> 01:13:15.691
IN THE AUDIT REPORT. NO SO YOU

01:13:15.758 --> 01:13:16.391
KNOW WE LOOK AT EVERY PROGRAM

01:13:16.458 --> 01:13:17.893
WE WENT TO WE WENT THROUGH IN

01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:19.595
DETAIL THE REGULATORY-

01:13:19.661 --> 01:13:21.263
JUSTIFICATION DOCUMENTS AND

01:13:21.330 --> 01:13:22.731
THEN MANY OF THE FUNDING.

01:13:22.798 --> 01:13:23.599
THAT'S ON THE REGULATORY

01:13:23.665 --> 01:13:25.334
PROGRAM SIDE AND THEN. ON THE

01:13:25.400 --> 01:13:27.035
INCENTIVE PROGRAM SIDE ALL OF

01:13:27.102 --> 01:13:28.837
THE MATERIALS ASSOCIATED WITH

01:13:28.904 --> 01:13:30.539
THE FUNDING PLANS FOR CARP

01:13:30.606 --> 01:13:32.541
POSES FUNDING FOR THE PROGRAM.

01:13:32.608 --> 01:13:34.343
LOOKING FOR ANY REALLY ANY

01:13:34.409 --> 01:13:36.879
ACKNOWLEDGEMENT. OR ANY FORMAL

01:13:36.945 --> 01:13:38.147
KIND OF EIGHT AND NOW IT'S JUST

01:13:38.213 --> 01:13:39.948
OF THAT OVERLAP WHICH IS YOU

01:13:40.015 --> 01:13:41.617
KNOW VERY STARK IN MANY CASES

01:13:41.683 --> 01:13:44.286
AND DID NOT FIND IT- I WILL NOT

01:13:44.353 --> 01:13:45.721
AND THIS IS IMPORTANT I DON'T

01:13:45.788 --> 01:13:46.889
THE CONCLUSIONS YOU REACH AN

01:13:46.955 --> 01:13:49.591
ODD IT. IS THAT THE REASON CARP

01:13:49.658 --> 01:13:51.226
GAVE ON THE REGULATORY PROGRAM

01:13:51.293 --> 01:13:53.028
SIDE WAS. THAT IT WANTS TO

01:13:53.095 --> 01:13:55.030
DEVELOP STANDARDS REGULATIONS

01:13:55.097 --> 01:13:57.099
AND RULES THAT ARE ACHIEVABLE

01:13:57.166 --> 01:13:58.934
WITHOUT THE HELP OF INCENTIVE

01:13:59.001 --> 01:14:00.736
PROGRAM- BECAUSE IT DOESN'T

01:14:00.803 --> 01:14:02.004
KNOW WHETHER INCENTIVE POGRAMS

01:14:02.070 --> 01:14:03.906
LIKE CBRC WILL EXIST IN

01:14:03.972 --> 01:14:05.174
PERPETUITY. OR WHETHER THERE'LL

01:14:05.240 --> 01:14:06.942
BE ENOUGH MONEY TO ACCOUNT FOR

01:14:07.009 --> 01:14:08.143
THE ENTIRETY OF THE INDUSTRY

01:14:08.210 --> 01:14:09.912
THAT'S BEING AFFECTED. AND SO

01:14:09.978 --> 01:14:11.380
WE YOU KNOW WE KIND OF GAVE

01:14:11.446 --> 01:14:12.581
CARD BENEFIT DOWN SO THAT'S A

01:14:12.648 --> 01:14:14.716
REASONABLE APPROACH WHAT THAT

01:14:14.783 --> 01:14:15.851
WHAT THAT MEANS ALMOST BY

01:14:15.918 --> 01:14:17.553
DEFINITION IS THAT. THE

01:14:17.619 --> 01:14:18.887
INCENTIVE DOLLARS SHOULD BE

01:14:18.954 --> 01:14:21.123
CREATING REDUCTIONS ABOVE AND

01:14:21.190 --> 01:14:22.624
BEYOND WHAT YOU REGULATIONS

01:14:22.691 --> 01:14:23.792
WHICH YOU ALONE AND THAT'S

01:14:23.859 --> 01:14:25.561
WHERE WE REALLY EXPECTED TO SEE

01:14:25.627 --> 01:14:27.496
AN ANALYSIS FROM CLARK ABOUT.

01:14:27.563 --> 01:14:29.832
OKAY WE HAVE C. B. R. P. WE

01:14:29.898 --> 01:14:31.433
KNOW WE HAVE IS THAT REGULATION

01:14:31.500 --> 01:14:33.101
THAT'S SUPPOSED TO STAND ON ITS

01:14:33.168 --> 01:14:33.535
OWN IN TERMS OF ITS

01:14:33.602 --> 01:14:35.704
EFFECTIVENESS. WHAT ELSE THE C.

01:14:35.771 --> 01:14:37.573
B. R. P. BRING TO THE TABLE IN

01:14:37.639 --> 01:14:39.641
TERMS OF VEHICLE SO. AND THERE

01:14:39.708 --> 01:14:41.810
IS SOME INDICATION IN STATEWIDE

01:14:41.877 --> 01:14:44.012
DATA THAT- IS THERE ARE BEING

01:14:44.079 --> 01:14:44.913
THERE ARE MORE IS THAT IS BEING

01:14:44.980 --> 01:14:46.181
SOLD IN THE REGULATIONS

01:14:46.248 --> 01:14:48.016
CURRENTLY REQUIRE. A CAR HASN'T

01:14:48.083 --> 01:14:50.085
DONE ANY ANY FORMAL EFFORT TO

01:14:50.152 --> 01:14:51.320
DETERMINE WHETHER THAT'S THE

01:14:51.386 --> 01:14:52.554
RESULT OF CVR PETE WHETHER

01:14:52.621 --> 01:14:53.922
THAT'S THE RESULT OF. THE

01:14:53.989 --> 01:14:55.290
CONSUMER PREFERENCE WHETHER

01:14:55.357 --> 01:14:56.325
THAT'S THE RESULT OF FEDERAL

01:14:56.391 --> 01:14:57.860
PROGRAMS ETCETERA SO THERE

01:14:57.926 --> 01:14:59.528
STILL ARE PRETTY MUCH IN THE

01:14:59.595 --> 01:15:01.296
DARK ABOUT THE MARGINAL BENEFIT

01:15:01.363 --> 01:15:02.764
AT THE INCENTIVE PROGRAM TO

01:15:02.831 --> 01:15:04.433
BRING TO THE TABLE. CALLACHAN

01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:05.801
NOT OVERLAP DO YOU HAVE ANY

01:15:05.868 --> 01:15:07.836
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE

01:15:07.903 --> 01:15:08.704
LEGISLATURE TO RECREATE A

01:15:08.770 --> 01:15:16.411
POLICY. THAT ENSURES CLEAR

01:15:16.478 --> 01:15:18.113
OUTCOMES FOR THOSE. WE DON'T

01:15:18.180 --> 01:15:18.680
HAVE A LEGISLATE RECORD. I

01:15:18.747 --> 01:15:19.715
DIRECTOR AT THIS. WE TRIED TO

01:15:19.781 --> 01:15:21.350
BE- WE TRY TO GET AWAY BEING

01:15:21.416 --> 01:15:22.484
OVER THE- ABOUT THE PROCESS

01:15:22.551 --> 01:15:25.520
THAT CARD SHOULD- SHOULD. SHIP

01:15:25.587 --> 01:15:26.622
APPROACH THAT'S WHERE ANOTHER

01:15:26.688 --> 01:15:28.590
WE WORK. VERY PRESCRIPTIVE

01:15:28.657 --> 01:15:29.024
ABOUT THE TYPES OF

01:15:29.091 --> 01:15:30.525
CONSIDERATIONS SHOULD MAKE.

01:15:30.592 --> 01:15:31.693
PART OF THAT IS YOU KNOW

01:15:31.760 --> 01:15:33.161
THEY'RE THESE THIS ISSUE MAY

01:15:33.228 --> 01:15:35.097
OR- MAY OR MAY NOT APPLY IN A

01:15:35.163 --> 01:15:36.798
MEAT PIE MORE OR LESS GIVEN TO

01:15:36.865 --> 01:15:38.000
SPECIFIC PROGRAM GIVEN THE

01:15:38.066 --> 01:15:39.468
SPECIFIC VEHICLE. WE

01:15:39.534 --> 01:15:41.169
INTENTIONALLY LOOK AT PROGRAMS

01:15:41.236 --> 01:15:42.504
THAT WE THOUGHT HAD A HIGH RISK

01:15:42.571 --> 01:15:44.806
OF OVERLAP OR POSSIBLE.

01:15:44.873 --> 01:15:47.209
DUPLICATION OR REDUNDANCY- AND

01:15:47.276 --> 01:15:49.077
IN ANOTHER ISSUE ANOTHER REASON

01:15:49.144 --> 01:15:51.546
RATHER IS THAT CAR MADE YOU

01:15:51.613 --> 01:15:53.148
KNOW HAS SIGNIFICANT WORK TO DO

01:15:53.215 --> 01:15:54.783
TO THINK ABOUT. HOW THESE

01:15:54.850 --> 01:15:57.286
PROGRAMS ARE DESIGNED. IN ORDER

01:15:57.352 --> 01:15:58.420
TO STIMULATE THE GREATEST

01:15:58.487 --> 01:15:59.588
ACTIVITY ON THE BACK END BUT

01:15:59.655 --> 01:16:00.956
ALSO TO MAKE SURE THEY HAVE

01:16:01.023 --> 01:16:02.658
METRICS THAT THEY CAN THEY CAN

01:16:02.724 --> 01:16:05.527
BE ACCOUNTABLE FOR. THAT SAID-

01:16:05.594 --> 01:16:07.529
YOU KNOW IF THERE IF THERE IS A

01:16:07.596 --> 01:16:09.531
ROLE FOR LEGISLATIVE. OVERSIGHT

01:16:09.598 --> 01:16:11.533
OR OR- EVER KIND OF BELIEVE

01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:13.035
THAT CAR IS DOING THAT. NO WE

01:16:13.101 --> 01:16:20.108
CAN CERTAINLY. KEEP PROVIDING.

01:16:20.175 --> 01:16:20.742
SURGICAL SYSTEMS THAT YOU MIGHT

01:16:20.809 --> 01:16:21.510
NEED. THANK YOU I HAVE A

01:16:21.576 --> 01:16:22.210
QUESTIONS REMAIN A DEFERRED OF

01:16:22.277 --> 01:16:23.245
COLLEAGUE IN THE ROOM- FOR

01:16:23.312 --> 01:16:25.147
THEIR QUOTE. OF I DO WAY TO ASK.

01:16:25.213 --> 01:16:25.914
MEMBERS KNOW THAT ARE

01:16:25.981 --> 01:16:27.582
PARTICIPATING REMOTELY IF YOU

01:16:27.649 --> 01:16:29.551
WANT TO GET ON THE LISTS TO ASK

01:16:29.618 --> 01:16:31.420
A QUESTION. I BELIEVE THE

01:16:31.486 --> 01:16:33.021
QUICKEST AND MOST EFFICIENT WAY

01:16:33.088 --> 01:16:35.424
IS TO JUST TEXT. ME AND I THINK

01:16:35.490 --> 01:16:36.258
MY NUMBER WAS PROVIDED TO EACH

01:16:36.325 --> 01:16:38.226
OF THE MEMBERS- TEXT ME AND

01:16:38.293 --> 01:16:40.062
I'LL GET YOU AND Q. FOR A LINE

01:16:40.128 --> 01:16:41.196
OF QUESTIONING SO WITH THAT

01:16:41.263 --> 01:16:42.564
WE'RE GOING TO MOVE. TO

01:16:42.631 --> 01:16:46.368
ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRIEDMAN THAN

01:16:46.435 --> 01:16:46.935
TO SENATOR GONZALEZ SENT TO

01:16:47.002 --> 01:16:48.303
SENATOR DOLLY. THANKS AT FIRST

01:16:48.370 --> 01:16:49.671
I WANT TO THANK THE AUDITOR AND

01:16:49.738 --> 01:16:50.706
THANK SENATOR BRADFORD FOR

01:16:50.772 --> 01:16:51.707
BRINGING THIS FORWARD IT'S

01:16:51.773 --> 01:16:53.608
CRUCIAL. THAT WE HAVE GOOD

01:16:53.675 --> 01:16:54.843
QUANTITATIVE DATA TO UNDERSTAND

01:16:54.910 --> 01:16:56.478
THESE PROGRAMS THAT IMPROVE THE

01:16:56.545 --> 01:16:57.045
MOVING FORWARD I THINK THAT

01:16:57.112 --> 01:16:58.780
SHOULD BE EVERYBODY'S GOAL. AND

01:16:58.847 --> 01:17:00.983
I REALLY APPRECIATE FROM. THE

01:17:01.049 --> 01:17:02.517
AUDITOR HIGHLIGHTING SOME OF

01:17:02.584 --> 01:17:03.685
THE DEFICIENCIES IN THE

01:17:03.752 --> 01:17:05.554
REPORTS. I JUST HAVE A FEW

01:17:05.620 --> 01:17:07.522
QUICK QUESTIONS- FIRST OF ALL.

01:17:07.589 --> 01:17:10.058
ANOTHER STATEMENT I. DO THINK

01:17:10.125 --> 01:17:11.793
THAT WHEN IT COMES TO. I'M

01:17:11.860 --> 01:17:12.894
LOOKING AT THE ISSUE WITH

01:17:12.961 --> 01:17:14.763
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND

01:17:14.830 --> 01:17:17.933
THE SORT OF UNDER UTILIZATION

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:19.768
OF. THE INCENTIVES I THINK T'S

01:17:19.835 --> 01:17:21.536
ALSO REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE

01:17:21.603 --> 01:17:22.971
USE DATA TO UNDERSTAND THAT

01:17:23.038 --> 01:17:25.007
THERE PROBABLY THAT THERE. VERY

01:17:25.073 --> 01:17:27.109
WELL MIGHT BE BARRIERS. BEYOND

01:17:27.175 --> 01:17:28.276
THE INCENTIVE THAT PREVENT

01:17:28.343 --> 01:17:29.578
THOSE COMMUNITIES FROM TAKING

01:17:29.644 --> 01:17:32.047
ADVANTAGE. OF THE PROGRAM- THE

01:17:32.114 --> 01:17:33.715
INABILITY TO INSURE A CAR IN

01:17:33.782 --> 01:17:35.384
ABILITY TO STORE CAR CHARGER

01:17:35.450 --> 01:17:37.352
CARD IS A LOT OF THINGS BEYOND

01:17:37.419 --> 01:17:39.388
THE PROGRAM ITSELF. SOME OF

01:17:39.454 --> 01:17:40.956
WHICH COULD BE VERY WELL OUT OF

01:17:41.023 --> 01:17:42.991
CARDS CONTROL AND I REALLY LIKE

01:17:43.058 --> 01:17:44.326
THE COMMON FROM THE AUDITOR.

01:17:44.393 --> 01:17:45.961
ABOUT LOOKING AT MOBILITY AND

01:17:46.028 --> 01:17:48.363
EQUITY- YEAH AND SERVING

01:17:48.430 --> 01:17:49.197
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES IN

01:17:49.264 --> 01:17:51.666
TERMS OF. HAVING AN EYE TOWARDS

01:17:51.733 --> 01:17:53.435
NOT JUST SAYING WE WANT

01:17:53.502 --> 01:17:54.369
EVERYBODY IN THESE COMPANIES

01:17:54.436 --> 01:17:56.171
TO. PURCHASE A VEHICLE OR BE

01:17:56.238 --> 01:17:57.606
ABLE TO BUT TO SAY WE WANT

01:17:57.672 --> 01:17:59.107
EVERYBODY IN THESE COMMUNITIES

01:17:59.174 --> 01:18:01.343
TO HAVE VERY GOOD CONVENIENT

01:18:01.410 --> 01:18:03.712
MOBILITY OPTIONS. THAT ARE-

01:18:03.779 --> 01:18:05.147
PROVIDE THEM BETTER MOBILITY

01:18:05.213 --> 01:18:06.715
MODE TO MOBILITY NEEDS TO BE

01:18:06.782 --> 01:18:08.250
THE GOAL NOT ANY PARTICULAR

01:18:08.316 --> 01:18:12.888
TYPE OF VEHICLE- SO. MY

01:18:12.954 --> 01:18:14.456
QUESTION IS IF AND WHEN MORE

01:18:14.523 --> 01:18:15.590
COMMON IN THE MY QUESTION

01:18:15.657 --> 01:18:16.591
EITHER CALL COMMENT IS THAT

01:18:16.658 --> 01:18:17.692
SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT YOU

01:18:17.759 --> 01:18:18.794
HAD HIGHLIGHTED AS POTENTIAL

01:18:18.860 --> 01:18:20.262
QUESTIONS TO ASK PEOPLE IN

01:18:20.328 --> 01:18:22.364
THESE COMMUNITIES ABOUT. THEIR

01:18:22.431 --> 01:18:24.733
FINANCIAL STATUS BEFORE HAVING

01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:26.902
A CAR AND AFTER INCOME. I DO

01:18:26.968 --> 01:18:28.070
THINK COULD BE SEEN BY SOME

01:18:28.136 --> 01:18:29.337
MEMBERS OF THE CAN OF THAT

01:18:29.404 --> 01:18:30.205
COMMUNITIES BEING VERY

01:18:30.272 --> 01:18:31.473
INTRUSIVE QUESTIONS SO I THINK

01:18:31.540 --> 01:18:33.275
THAT IT'S NOT THAT EASY. TO GET

01:18:33.341 --> 01:18:34.543
PARTICIPATION WITH THAT KIND OF

01:18:34.609 --> 01:18:37.112
LINE OF QUESTIONING FOR ANYBODY

01:18:37.179 --> 01:18:37.746
THEY'RE THEY'RE PRETTY INVASIVE

01:18:37.813 --> 01:18:40.749
QUESTIONS. SO MY QUESTION IS.

01:18:40.816 --> 01:18:42.751
THAT I WONDER WHETHER. THAT

01:18:42.818 --> 01:18:45.320
THAT A LOT OF THESE IMPACTS ARE

01:18:45.387 --> 01:18:46.288
ONLY BE ON CARBS. KIND OF

01:18:46.354 --> 01:18:48.190
JURISDICTION UP BEYOND THEIR

01:18:48.256 --> 01:18:50.192
ABILITY TO REALLY ASCERTAIN.

01:18:50.258 --> 01:18:50.959
AND I'M WONDERING IF THE

01:18:51.026 --> 01:18:52.327
AUDITOR HAS ANY SUGGESTIONS OF

01:18:52.394 --> 01:18:53.662
WHO REALLY SHOULD BE DOING THIS

01:18:53.728 --> 01:18:55.931
pLOOKING AT THIS BECAUSE I SAYS

01:18:55.997 --> 01:18:58.033
LISTENING TO I WONDER WHETHER

01:18:58.100 --> 01:19:00.936
CARP IS THE CORRECT. BODY TO DO

01:19:01.002 --> 01:19:03.238
SO EVALUATION OF THOSE KINDS OF

01:19:03.305 --> 01:19:03.772
IMPACTS SO THAT'S MY FIRST

01:19:03.839 --> 01:19:09.578
QUESTION. CERTAINLY SO. I DON'T

01:19:09.644 --> 01:19:10.045
I DON'T THINK IT'S OUR

01:19:10.112 --> 01:19:11.613
INTENTION TO RULE OUT THE

01:19:11.680 --> 01:19:12.214
ASSISTANCE FOR THE

01:19:12.280 --> 01:19:13.882
PARTICIPATION OF ANY OTHER

01:19:13.949 --> 01:19:16.151
ENTITY AND AS WE AS WE INCLUDE

01:19:16.218 --> 01:19:17.752
IN OUR REPORT CARD IS UNDER

01:19:17.819 --> 01:19:19.421
CONTRACT WITH YOU SEE AND OTHER

01:19:19.488 --> 01:19:22.557
ENTITIES AND- I WITH THE- THE

01:19:22.624 --> 01:19:25.727
AIM OF. OF A ATTEMPTING TO HAVE

01:19:25.794 --> 01:19:26.495
IMPROVED SO MUCH DATA

01:19:26.561 --> 01:19:29.164
COLLECTION- BUT I THINK WHAT WE

01:19:29.231 --> 01:19:31.266
KEEP COMING BACK SO WE KEPT

01:19:31.333 --> 01:19:32.467
COMING BACK TO IN OUR ANALYSIS

01:19:32.534 --> 01:19:34.803
WAS IN. UNDERSTANDING THE

01:19:34.870 --> 01:19:36.471
BARRIERS THAT THAT YOU THAT YOU

01:19:36.538 --> 01:19:38.106
RAISED ABOUT SOME OF THE

01:19:38.173 --> 01:19:39.975
QUESTIONS ARE ACCESSING THESE.

01:19:40.041 --> 01:19:40.642
THOSE QUITE YOU KNOW THE

01:19:40.709 --> 01:19:41.643
QUESTIONS YOU'RE REFERENCING

01:19:41.710 --> 01:19:43.712
ARE ARE ARE CARDS ONLY DESIGNED

01:19:43.778 --> 01:19:45.714
SO. IT APPEARS THAT THERE'S AN

01:19:45.780 --> 01:19:47.048
ACKNOWLEDGEMENT CARL WHEN THEY

01:19:47.115 --> 01:19:48.150
DESIGNED THESE PROGRAMS AND

01:19:48.216 --> 01:19:49.684
THAT THEY CREATE A LOGIC MODEL

01:19:49.751 --> 01:19:51.720
THAT SHOULD BE MEASURABLE- THAT

01:19:51.786 --> 01:19:53.655
THEY EXPECT TO HAPPEN- WE JUST

01:19:53.722 --> 01:19:55.457
HAVEN'T SEEN. THE LEVEL OF

01:19:55.524 --> 01:19:57.559
EFFORT ON THE BACK AND SO YOU

01:19:57.626 --> 01:19:59.594
KNOW IF WE HAD MORE OF THAT

01:19:59.661 --> 01:20:01.630
EFFORT TRIAL AND ERROR TO

01:20:01.696 --> 01:20:03.665
ASSESS AND WE KNEW MORE ABOUT

01:20:03.732 --> 01:20:06.034
WHAT- IN ACTUALITY WHAT THE

01:20:06.101 --> 01:20:07.435
BEARS HAVE BEEN TO CARD DATA

01:20:07.502 --> 01:20:09.004
COLLECTION IT WOULD BE EASIER

01:20:09.070 --> 01:20:11.106
FOR US TO SPEAK TO. WHO THE

01:20:11.173 --> 01:20:12.841
RIGHT PERSON IS IF IT'S NOT CAR

01:20:12.908 --> 01:20:15.243
BUT UNFORTUNATELY THAT'S NOT

01:20:15.310 --> 01:20:17.345
KIND OF A- A REALITY WE WERE

01:20:17.412 --> 01:20:19.648
ABLE TO EVALUATE. SO YOU DON'T

01:20:19.714 --> 01:20:21.783
HAVE ANY ANY IDEAS OF KIND OF

01:20:21.850 --> 01:20:23.985
WHAT THE RIGHT. WHO WHAT THEIR

01:20:24.052 --> 01:20:25.620
IDENTITY WOULD BE SAID TO DO

01:20:25.687 --> 01:20:26.821
THIS KIND OF ANALYSIS OR EVEN

01:20:26.888 --> 01:20:28.089
TO THE DATA COLLECTION BECAUSE

01:20:28.156 --> 01:20:33.595
IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE IT'S- DONE

01:20:33.662 --> 01:20:34.196
TO MY- CAR. TO ME. WELL IT'S

01:20:34.262 --> 01:20:36.865
NOT JUST CAR. CAR PARTY. CAR

01:20:36.932 --> 01:20:39.734
PAYS- ERR DISTRICTS AND ALL

01:20:39.801 --> 01:20:41.503
NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS TO

01:20:41.570 --> 01:20:43.538
ADMINISTER. THESE PROGRAMS TO

01:20:43.605 --> 01:20:45.040
INTERFACE WITH PARTICIPANTS TO

01:20:45.106 --> 01:20:47.442
HANDLE. ALL OF THE APPLICATION

01:20:47.509 --> 01:20:49.711
PROCESS SEES. AND SO ON THEY

01:20:49.778 --> 01:20:51.546
MAY NOT BE CARVE ON THE GROUND

01:20:51.613 --> 01:20:53.882
ASKING THESE QUESTIONS. BUT

01:20:53.949 --> 01:20:55.817
THAT WOULD BE YOU KNOW THAT'S

01:20:55.884 --> 01:20:57.352
KIND OF A NATURAL. YOU KNOW

01:20:57.419 --> 01:21:00.555
INROAD INTO- YOU KNOW WORKING

01:21:00.622 --> 01:21:03.391
WITH PARTICIPANTS REMAINING BE.

01:21:03.458 --> 01:21:04.726
COLLECTING DATA WHATEVER IT MAY

01:21:04.793 --> 01:21:06.494
BE RELEVANT TO THE PROGRAM BUT

01:21:06.561 --> 01:21:08.396
WHAT WE HAVEN'T SEEN IS

01:21:08.463 --> 01:21:09.931
APPROPRIATE KIND OF FORESIGHT

01:21:09.998 --> 01:21:12.300
IN OVERSIGHT I'M CARP TO ENSURE

01:21:12.367 --> 01:21:15.503
THAT IS POSITIONING ITSELF. TO

01:21:15.570 --> 01:21:16.838
REQUIRE THAT DATA COLLECTION TO

01:21:16.905 --> 01:21:18.607
HELP ITS PROGRAM ADMINISTRATORS

01:21:18.673 --> 01:21:19.975
KNOW WHAT TO COLLECT AND

01:21:20.041 --> 01:21:21.643
CERTAINLY TO REVIVE IT WHETHER

01:21:21.710 --> 01:21:23.812
OR NOT IT'S BEING COLLECTED SO

01:21:23.878 --> 01:21:26.047
AGAIN I WOULD I KIND OF JUST.

01:21:26.114 --> 01:21:26.915
LIKE A BETTER PHRASE DEFERRED

01:21:26.982 --> 01:21:29.417
TO THE FACT THAT- THERE DO SEEM

01:21:29.484 --> 01:21:31.519
TO BE A RESOURCES IN PLAY AND

01:21:31.586 --> 01:21:33.922
WITHOUT HAVING SEEN- EVIDENCE

01:21:33.989 --> 01:21:35.924
OF IT BEING UNSUCCESSFUL IN THE

01:21:35.991 --> 01:21:38.760
NEXT LEVEL OF EFFORT IT'S HARD

01:21:38.827 --> 01:21:41.263
FOR US TO SPECULATE ABOUT WOULD

01:21:41.329 --> 01:21:42.731
BE A MORE. A RESOURCE OKAY I

01:21:42.797 --> 01:21:44.065
ASK BECAUSE YOU KNOW I DO I

01:21:44.132 --> 01:21:45.033
THINK IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE

01:21:45.100 --> 01:21:46.668
HAVE BETTER DATA AND WE HAVE

01:21:46.735 --> 01:21:49.271
THE DATA AS WE EVALUATE- THESE

01:21:49.337 --> 01:21:51.106
PROGRAMS. AND THEN MY LAST

01:21:51.172 --> 01:21:53.608
QUESTION FOR NOW IS- WHAT IS

01:21:53.675 --> 01:21:54.943
YOUR OFFICE AND BUSINESS THE

01:21:55.010 --> 01:21:56.978
IDEAL OUTCOME FROM THIS AUDIT.

01:21:57.045 --> 01:21:58.780
IS IT TO HAVE CARBS SPEND MORE

01:21:58.847 --> 01:22:01.616
TIME ON PROGRAMMATIC YOU KNOW

01:22:01.683 --> 01:22:04.819
QUALIFICATIONS AND- VALUATIONS

01:22:04.886 --> 01:22:06.621
OR IS IT TO ELIMINATE THE

01:22:06.688 --> 01:22:07.856
PROGRAM SAID AREN'T REALLY

01:22:07.922 --> 01:22:10.258
DIRECTLY. REDUCING EMISSIONS. I

01:22:10.325 --> 01:22:12.127
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT A GOOD.

01:22:12.193 --> 01:22:13.228
POINT OF THE AUDIT IS AT THE

01:22:13.295 --> 01:22:15.230
LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO UNDERSTAND

01:22:15.297 --> 01:22:16.064
HOW THESE PROGRAMS INTERACT

01:22:16.131 --> 01:22:17.632
WITH EACH OTHER RIGHT. BECAUSE

01:22:17.699 --> 01:22:19.134
NO ONE PROGRAM IS GOING TO KIND

01:22:19.200 --> 01:22:20.468
OF BE THE SILVER BULLET YOU'RE

01:22:20.535 --> 01:22:22.504
A LOT OF DIFFERENT PROGRAMS AND

01:22:22.570 --> 01:22:24.239
A LOT OF DIFFERENT POLICY. CAN

01:22:24.306 --> 01:22:25.607
THIS ONLY BE ACCOMPLISHED WITH

01:22:25.674 --> 01:22:27.075
THE QUANTIFICATION OF THE

01:22:27.142 --> 01:22:28.443
IMPACTS OF THE PROGRAM OR IS

01:22:28.510 --> 01:22:30.312
IT. JUST AS IMPORTANT FOR US TO

01:22:30.378 --> 01:22:31.680
HAVE SORT OF A BETTER NARRATIVE

01:22:31.746 --> 01:22:33.048
OF HOW ALL THESE PROGRAMS WORK

01:22:33.114 --> 01:22:36.318
TOGETHER AND THE REGULATORY

01:22:36.384 --> 01:22:39.754
SIDE WORK TOGETHER. THANK YOU.

01:22:39.821 --> 01:22:42.424
I THINK THE NARRATIVE. THE

01:22:42.490 --> 01:22:44.125
NARRATIVE IS RELATIVELY IN

01:22:44.192 --> 01:22:45.927
PLACE IN SOME CASE RIGHT THAT

01:22:45.994 --> 01:22:48.096
THE LOGIC MODELS DO YOU KNOW

01:22:48.163 --> 01:22:50.298
THAT THE ASSUMPTIONS ARE NOT

01:22:50.365 --> 01:22:51.800
UNREASONABLE AND OF PROGRAM BY

01:22:51.866 --> 01:22:54.369
PROGRAM BASIS IT'S NOT- I DON'T

01:22:54.436 --> 01:22:55.437
WE DIDN'T APPROACH THIS WITH

01:22:55.503 --> 01:22:57.038
THE ANY SORT OF PRECONCEIVED

01:22:57.105 --> 01:22:58.773
NOTIONS ABOUT YOU KNOW WHETHER

01:22:58.840 --> 01:22:59.774
WHETHER IT DOES OR DOES NOT

01:22:59.841 --> 01:23:01.576
MAKE SENSE TO ON THE ONE HAND

01:23:01.643 --> 01:23:02.844
COMPELS CERTAIN TYPES OF

01:23:02.911 --> 01:23:03.945
PRODUCTION AND SALE ON THE

01:23:04.012 --> 01:23:05.647
OTHER HAND REALLY TRY TO HELP

01:23:05.714 --> 01:23:07.749
PEOPLE. BRING CALIFORNIA PASSED

01:23:07.816 --> 01:23:08.950
WHAT REGULATIONS CAN

01:23:09.017 --> 01:23:09.951
REALISTICALLY ACHIEVE ON THEIR

01:23:10.018 --> 01:23:11.753
OWN I DO THINK AT THIS POINT

01:23:11.820 --> 01:23:13.755
REALLY DOES COME DOWN TO BEING

01:23:13.822 --> 01:23:15.490
INTENTIONAL ABOUT LEARNING FROM

01:23:15.557 --> 01:23:16.691
WHAT FOR MEASURING WHAT

01:23:16.758 --> 01:23:18.059
PROGRAMS ARE ACTUALLY ABLE TO

01:23:18.126 --> 01:23:20.395
ACHIEVE IN THESE DIFFERENT WAYS

01:23:20.462 --> 01:23:20.929
AND WE ARE DIFFERENT DATA

01:23:20.995 --> 01:23:22.797
SOURCES. AND BEING INTENTIONAL

01:23:22.864 --> 01:23:24.699
ABOUT WHETHER THOSE PROGRAMS

01:23:24.766 --> 01:23:26.634
ARE ADDING THE MAGNITUDE OF

01:23:26.701 --> 01:23:27.535
BENEFITS THAT THAT THE STATE

01:23:27.602 --> 01:23:29.304
WOULD EXPECT AND FUNDAMENTALLY

01:23:29.371 --> 01:23:32.173
IN TERMS OF OUR PRODUCTS WE

01:23:32.240 --> 01:23:33.174
WOULD HOPE THAT THAT IS

01:23:33.241 --> 01:23:37.979
INFORMATION. FOR THE

01:23:38.046 --> 01:23:38.480
LEGISLATURE THAT JOINS.

01:23:38.546 --> 01:23:40.281
EVERYWHERE DATA ABOUT. YOU KNOW

01:23:40.348 --> 01:23:41.616
THESE OF INCENTIVE PROGRAMS

01:23:41.683 --> 01:23:42.984
PROVIDE THESE TYPES OF BENEFITS

01:23:43.051 --> 01:23:45.153
RELIABLY MAYBE THESE DO NOT AS

01:23:45.220 --> 01:23:47.055
MUCH WE SHOULD WE SHOULD INVEST

01:23:47.122 --> 01:23:49.791
MORE IN PROGRAMS ACCESS AND

01:23:49.858 --> 01:23:51.693
CONSIDER REVISIONS TO PROGRAM

01:23:51.760 --> 01:23:53.828
WHY I THINK THE PROBLEM RIGHT

01:23:53.895 --> 01:23:55.764
NOW IS THAT THE SAME SORT OF

01:23:55.830 --> 01:23:57.499
LIMITATION EDELWEISS

01:23:57.565 --> 01:23:59.367
MEASUREMENT WISE REPORTING WHY.

01:23:59.434 --> 01:24:01.269
ARE KIND OF PRESENCE ACROSS THE

01:24:01.336 --> 01:24:02.971
ENTIRE RANGE OF INCENTIVE

01:24:03.037 --> 01:24:05.206
PROGRAMS BE REVIEWED AND SO THE

01:24:05.273 --> 01:24:07.375
LEGISLATURE IS AS IT IS FORCED

01:24:07.442 --> 01:24:09.611
TO TAKE AT FACE VALUE THE YOU

01:24:09.677 --> 01:24:10.612
KNOW THE RELATIVE EFFICACY OF

01:24:10.678 --> 01:24:12.480
THOSE PROGRAMS WHEN IN FACT

01:24:12.547 --> 01:24:14.149
THOSE DON'T ACTUALLY THOSE

01:24:14.215 --> 01:24:15.150
MEASUREMENTS DON'T ACTUALLY

01:24:15.216 --> 01:24:17.051
TELL THE STORY ABOUT HOW THE

01:24:17.118 --> 01:24:18.219
PUSH AND PULL WITH REGULATIONS

01:24:18.286 --> 01:24:20.221
OR THE- THE INFLUENCE FROM

01:24:20.288 --> 01:24:21.623
OUTSIDE OF CARDS CONTROL

01:24:21.689 --> 01:24:23.091
WHETHER IT BE FROM OTHER STATE

01:24:23.158 --> 01:24:24.993
PROGRAMS OR FEDERAL PROGRAMS.

01:24:25.059 --> 01:24:27.395
SO IT DON'T START A SAYS IT IS

01:24:27.462 --> 01:24:28.530
TO CLARIFY IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE

01:24:28.596 --> 01:24:29.364
YOU'RE SAYING THAT REALLY THE

01:24:29.431 --> 01:24:30.865
ULTIMATE GOAL OF THE AUDIT IN

01:24:30.932 --> 01:24:35.336
THE END OF THE DAY IS FOR US TO

01:24:35.403 --> 01:24:37.038
UNDERSTAND THAT BIGGER PICTURE

01:24:37.105 --> 01:24:37.939
OF HOW THESE PROGRAMS. INTERACT

01:24:38.006 --> 01:24:39.808
WITH EACH OTHER. RIGHT SO IT'S

01:24:39.874 --> 01:24:41.609
NOT REALLY TIED TO SAY THAT

01:24:41.676 --> 01:24:43.445
ANYONE PROGRAMS NOT WORKING

01:24:43.511 --> 01:24:45.113
IT'S- IT IS TO DEVELOP THAT

01:24:45.180 --> 01:24:47.048
DATA SET THAT GIVES US THAT

01:24:47.115 --> 01:24:49.250
THAT HOLISTIC PICTURE. WE WOULD

01:24:49.317 --> 01:24:50.718
HOPE THAT THAT DATA SAID WOULD

01:24:50.785 --> 01:24:52.420
TASK THE ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT HOW

01:24:52.487 --> 01:24:54.422
THESE PROGRAMS FIT TOGETHER.

01:24:54.489 --> 01:24:55.490
AND GIVE THE IN THE LEGISLATURE

01:24:55.557 --> 01:24:56.791
INFORMATION ABOUT WHERE THEY'RE

01:24:56.858 --> 01:24:58.126
GETTING BANG FOR THEIR BUCK

01:24:58.193 --> 01:24:59.060
WHERE THEY'RE GETTING RETURN ON

01:24:59.127 --> 01:25:00.795
INVESTMENT. SO THE LISTENER CAN

01:25:00.862 --> 01:25:02.764
MAKE INFORMED AND RELIABLE

01:25:02.831 --> 01:25:04.466
DECISIONS ABOUT WHERE TO PUT

01:25:04.532 --> 01:25:06.401
OUR RESOURCES IN THE PURSUIT OF

01:25:06.468 --> 01:25:10.038
THE CALLS SO YES. UNDERSTANDING

01:25:10.104 --> 01:25:10.905
ROGAN'S WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED

01:25:10.972 --> 01:25:12.440
TO ACCOMPLISH IS A KEY STEP.

01:25:12.507 --> 01:25:14.008
BUT YOU KNOW THAT IN AND OF

01:25:14.075 --> 01:25:15.743
ITSELF IS NOT GOING TO BE

01:25:15.810 --> 01:25:16.344
SUFFICIENT FOR THE LEGISLATURE

01:25:16.411 --> 01:25:18.713
TO MAKE. YOU KNOW CLEAN BASS

01:25:18.780 --> 01:25:20.615
MAKES RELIABLE INVESTMENTS NOW

01:25:20.682 --> 01:25:22.050
IT MIGHT ONLY BE SUFFICIENT TO

01:25:22.116 --> 01:25:23.284
ALLOW US TO GET TO TWENTY

01:25:23.351 --> 01:25:23.985
THIRTY AND THEN LOOK BACKWARDS

01:25:24.052 --> 01:25:25.920
AND SAY. YOU KNOW WE'RE OUR

01:25:25.987 --> 01:25:27.789
ASSUMPTIONS CORRECT YES OR NO.

01:25:27.856 --> 01:25:28.690
THAT'S NOT THAT WE DON'T

01:25:28.756 --> 01:25:29.958
BELIEVE THAT'S A SUFFICIENT

01:25:30.024 --> 01:25:32.460
PLACE FOR THE STATE TO KIND OF.

01:25:32.527 --> 01:25:33.027
WAIT AROUND. THANK YOU VERY

HAVE YOU CAN DETERMINE. THE

01:25:40.535 --> 01:25:41.069
MOST BANG FOR THE BUCK IS KIND

01:25:41.135 --> 01:25:42.837
WITH THEIR- TALKED ABOUT WITH

01:25:42.904 --> 01:25:44.305
THE WILL OF THE CENTRE GONZALEZ

01:25:44.372 --> 01:25:47.509
AND THEN WILL MOVE TO- SON.

01:25:47.575 --> 01:25:48.877
SENATOR DOLLY THEN ASSEMBLY

01:25:48.943 --> 01:25:50.478
MEMBER FRAZIER THAN ASSEMBLY

01:25:50.545 --> 01:25:51.246

YOU CHAIR SALASAND THANK YOU

VERY MUCH FOR THIS- PANEL. MOST

01:25:59.621 --> 01:26:00.355
OF THE QUESTIONS THAT I ASK

01:26:00.421 --> 01:26:01.623
ACTUALLY HAVE BEEN ANSWERED

01:26:01.689 --> 01:26:03.358
BUT- I JUST WANT TO DRILL DOWN

01:26:03.424 --> 01:26:05.026
ON ON ONE PARTICULAR PROGRAM

01:26:05.093 --> 01:26:06.227
THAT YOU'D MENTIONED WHICH IS

01:26:06.294 --> 01:26:07.929
THE LOAN REPAYMENT INCREASE

01:26:07.996 --> 01:26:11.099
CREDIT SCORES GOAL- AND I GUESS

01:26:11.165 --> 01:26:13.968
THE- DISCUSSION THERE WAS THAT

01:26:14.035 --> 01:26:15.937
THEY- DON'T. FROM CARBS

01:26:16.004 --> 01:26:17.171
PERSPECTIVE IS THAT THEY DON'T

01:26:17.238 --> 01:26:18.940
CONTROL THE LOANS BUT CAN YOU

01:26:19.007 --> 01:26:21.276
GIVE US MORE. ON WHAT

01:26:21.342 --> 01:26:22.710
RECOMMENDATIONS COULD BE PUT

01:26:22.777 --> 01:26:24.913
FORWARD IN ADDITION TO JUST

01:26:24.979 --> 01:26:28.216
STATING FLATLY THAT THEY CAN'T

01:26:28.283 --> 01:26:29.050
CONTROL THE LOANS I MEAN WHAT.

01:26:29.117 --> 01:26:30.852
I MEAN THIS I THINK IS A BIG

01:26:30.919 --> 01:26:32.921
FACTOR IN. OBVIOUSLY THIS THIS

01:26:32.987 --> 01:26:36.858
PROGRAM AS WELL. IT DEFINITELY

01:26:36.925 --> 01:26:38.459
SO YOU KNOW POTENTIALLY

01:26:38.526 --> 01:26:40.161
POSSIBLY MINUS REMARKS KIND OF

01:26:40.228 --> 01:26:40.995
SHOWED UP YOU WEREN'T FULLY

01:26:41.062 --> 01:26:43.298
CONVINCED BY THAT YOU KNOW LACK

01:26:43.364 --> 01:26:45.033
OF OWNING A LOAN AS A AS A TRUE

01:26:45.099 --> 01:26:47.402
LIMITING FACTOR AND- YOU KNOW

01:26:47.468 --> 01:26:49.037
UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT'S BEEN

01:26:49.103 --> 01:26:50.505
RAISED ABOUT THE POTENTIAL YOU

01:26:50.572 --> 01:26:51.906
KNOW. INVASIVENESS OF QUESTIONS

01:26:51.973 --> 01:26:53.274
YOU KNOW WE ARE ENCOURAGED HARD

01:26:53.341 --> 01:26:54.876
TO DO WHAT I CAN TO WORK WITH

01:26:54.943 --> 01:26:56.377
THIS PROGRAM ADMINISTRATORS TO

01:26:56.444 --> 01:26:58.479
SAY. YOU KNOW ARE YOU A

01:26:58.546 --> 01:26:59.714
SUCCESSFULLY REPAYING YOUR LOAN

01:26:59.781 --> 01:27:00.848
I MEAN THE CARB CARB

01:27:00.915 --> 01:27:02.884
ALTERNATIVE WE IDENTIFIED THE

01:27:02.951 --> 01:27:05.620
FREQUENCY- REPOSSESSIONS OF

01:27:05.687 --> 01:27:07.589
VEHICLES IS ANOTHER POTENTIAL-

01:27:07.655 --> 01:27:08.890
TOOL THEY COULD USE BUT THAT'S

01:27:08.957 --> 01:27:09.991
NOT SOMETHING THEY'VE LOOKED AT

01:27:10.058 --> 01:27:11.693
FORMALLY WHEN WE RAISE THAT

01:27:11.759 --> 01:27:13.461
WITH THAT MAKE IT KIND OF WENT

01:27:13.528 --> 01:27:14.829
AND LOOKED TO SEE WHAT HAPPENED

01:27:14.896 --> 01:27:16.664
AND- AND SO IT'S A SMALL SMALL

01:27:16.731 --> 01:27:18.166
PROGRAM THUS FAR SO WE HAVEN'T

01:27:18.232 --> 01:27:20.868
REALLY. UTILIZE THIS DATA TO

01:27:20.935 --> 01:27:22.971
TRY AND EXTRAPOLATE ABOUT HOW

01:27:23.037 --> 01:27:25.173
EFFECTIVE THE PROGRAM IS. A

01:27:25.239 --> 01:27:25.873
HUNDRED AND THAT WAS WELL IT

01:27:25.940 --> 01:27:28.009
IT'S A HIGHLY PROGRAM SO IT'S

01:27:28.076 --> 01:27:29.344
KIND OF RELATIVELY SMALL BY ITS

01:27:29.410 --> 01:27:31.879
NATURE AND WHAT BETTER TIME TO

01:27:31.946 --> 01:27:33.715
BE USING TAKING ADVANTAGE OF

01:27:33.781 --> 01:27:38.586
THE PROGRAM'S RELATIVE. SIZE TO

01:27:38.653 --> 01:27:39.253
BE CREATIVE ABOUT. HOW GOING TO

01:27:39.320 --> 01:27:40.421
CALL THE GAP. WHITE WHERE YOU

01:27:40.488 --> 01:27:42.156
ARE NOW AND WHAT YOU THINK THE

01:27:42.223 --> 01:27:43.825
PROGRAM IS SUPPOSED TO PROVIDE

01:27:43.891 --> 01:27:45.226
TO ITS PARTICIPANTS IN TERMS.

01:27:45.293 --> 01:27:47.395
IT'S PAST SUPPORT SO. WE'RE NOT

01:27:47.462 --> 01:27:48.730
WE'RE NOT OPPOSED TO USING A

01:27:48.796 --> 01:27:50.798
REASONABLE STANDING OR PROXY

01:27:50.865 --> 01:27:54.102
FOR. CREDIT SCORES BUT CAR IS

01:27:54.168 --> 01:27:55.803
KIND OF WELL SHORT OF THAT. AND

01:27:55.870 --> 01:27:56.838
I MEAN THE LAST THING I'LL SAY

01:27:56.904 --> 01:27:57.839
ABOUT THIS PROGRAM SINCE YOU'VE

01:27:57.905 --> 01:27:59.707
EXPRESSED INTEREST IS. ALREADY

01:27:59.774 --> 01:28:02.076
OVER THE PROGRAM DATA THAT CAR

01:28:02.143 --> 01:28:04.078
DOES COLLECT. THE SUGGEST THAT

01:28:04.145 --> 01:28:05.513
THERE'S PRETTY WIDE VARIATION

01:28:05.580 --> 01:28:07.649
IN THE LOAN INTEREST RATES THAT

01:28:07.715 --> 01:28:10.251
THE PROGRAM IS INVOLVED. SO YOU

01:28:10.318 --> 01:28:11.352
DON'T MISS ANY LOANS ACHIEVED

01:28:11.419 --> 01:28:12.720
THROUGH THE PROGRAM DIRECTLY

01:28:12.787 --> 01:28:14.355
BUT WE SAW ALONE DESPITE YOU

01:28:14.422 --> 01:28:17.759
KNOW UPWARDS OF25% ON SOME OF

01:28:17.825 --> 01:28:19.127
THESE OTHER VEHICLE. DITIONS

01:28:19.193 --> 01:28:21.362
AND SO I GUESS I'M- TRY TO

01:28:21.429 --> 01:28:22.764
DIVORCE FROM WHAT'S DIRECTLY

01:28:22.830 --> 01:28:24.065
INSIDE AND OUTSIDE OF CARDS

01:28:24.132 --> 01:28:25.667
CONTROL WE DO FEEL LIKE IT'S IN

01:28:25.733 --> 01:28:27.168
OUR CONTROL IS TO BE. VERY

01:28:27.235 --> 01:28:28.670
PROACTIVE AND RESPONSIVE TO

01:28:28.736 --> 01:28:29.604
WHAT THEY'RE SEEING IN THAT

01:28:29.671 --> 01:28:31.005
THERE THE SITE IS THAT ALONE

01:28:31.072 --> 01:28:32.106
THAT WE WANT TO ASSOCIATE WITH

01:28:32.173 --> 01:28:33.908
OUR PROGRAM IS THAT A LOAN THAT

01:28:33.975 --> 01:28:35.977
PROVIDES. THE PARTICIPATE WITH

01:28:36.044 --> 01:28:37.412
THAT TYPE OF OPPORTUNITY

01:28:37.478 --> 01:28:39.347
PROGRAM IS INTENDED TO PROVIDE

01:28:39.414 --> 01:28:41.249
AND IF NOT THEN WE NEED TO SEE

01:28:41.315 --> 01:28:41.849
INTERVENTIONS AND WE NEED TO

01:28:41.916 --> 01:28:43.918
SEE THEM. AT THE PILOT PROGRAM

01:28:43.985 --> 01:28:46.087
STAGE BEFORE THERE IS A

01:28:46.154 --> 01:28:47.355
DECISION MADE TO EXPAND THIS

01:28:47.422 --> 01:28:49.524
PROGRAM LARGER OR ALTERNATELY

01:28:49.590 --> 01:28:51.726
NOT TO PURSUE IT SO I HOPE I

01:28:51.793 --> 01:28:53.528
ANSWERED YOUR QUESTION. YES YOU

01:28:53.594 --> 01:28:54.929

01:28:55.797 --> 01:28:57.732
WANTED TO THE POINT I GUESS I'M

01:28:57.799 --> 01:28:58.933
TRYING TO MAKE AS WELL AS THAT

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:00.702
YOU KNOW. THERE'S SO MANY OTHER

01:29:00.768 --> 01:29:02.303
ISSUES THAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED

01:29:02.370 --> 01:29:03.905
BECAUSE OF LACK OF OVERSIGHT

01:29:03.971 --> 01:29:05.173
WHICH IS THESE HIGH INTEREST

01:29:05.239 --> 01:29:06.340
RATES WHICH PUTS PEOPLE DEEPER

01:29:06.407 --> 01:29:11.312
IN. DEBT AND THAT- A MUCH MORE

01:29:11.379 --> 01:29:12.180
DIFFICULT SITUATION THAN THEY

01:29:12.246 --> 01:29:14.115
NEED TO BE- SO I APPRECIATE

01:29:14.182 --> 01:29:15.750
THAT AND SO I'LL LEAVE IT THERE

01:29:15.817 --> 01:29:16.984
BUT WELL I WHAT I WILL SAY IS

01:29:19.020 --> 01:29:20.955
BY THE LACK OF DATA COLLECTION

01:29:21.022 --> 01:29:22.156
THIS LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAM

01:29:22.223 --> 01:29:24.258
THAT SHOULD BENEFIT PEOPLE AND

01:29:24.325 --> 01:29:26.227
THEN THE CONSUMER BEHAVIOR

01:29:26.294 --> 01:29:26.961
TRENDS SHOULD BE A GOAL AS YOU

ORDER. SO I GUESS I CAN SAY

01:31:16.938 --> 01:31:17.705
THAT EXECUTIVE ORDER WASN'T

01:31:17.772 --> 01:31:20.007

WHATSOEVER TO TELL US. WE WOULD

01:33:23.597 --> 01:33:25.700
HAVE HOUGHT THAT THROUGH THAT

01:33:25.766 --> 01:33:28.235
PROCESS WITH THE TRANSPORTATION.

COMMITTEE THAT THAT WOULD HAVE

01:33:30.104 --> 01:33:33.941
EVOLVED. BUT IT SEEMS TO COME

01:33:34.008 --> 01:33:37.078
FORWARD THAT. THERE'S THIS KIND

01:33:37.144 --> 01:33:39.547

WHAT WE WANTED TO. AND YOU KNOW

01:33:44.752 --> 01:33:45.886
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IF YOU

01:33:45.953 --> 01:33:47.822
LOOK AT. THE MONIES THAT HAVE

01:33:47.888 --> 01:33:49.991
BEEN SPENT SINCE. CAP AND TRADE

01:33:50.057 --> 01:33:52.960
IS BEEN INVOLVED. 25% OF CAP

01:33:53.027 --> 01:33:54.362
AND TRADE GOES TO HIGH SPEED

01:33:54.428 --> 01:33:58.199
RAIL. ANOTHER 25% OF CAP AND

01:33:58.265 --> 01:34:01.369
TRADE GOES TO TRANSIT. WE HAVE

01:34:01.435 --> 01:34:03.371
GONE THROUGH A HUGE RECESSION

01:34:03.437 --> 01:34:05.373

A HUGE PANDEMIC. BUT THERE WAS

01:34:11.645 --> 01:34:13.814
NEVER ANY RELIEF FOR GOALS OR

01:34:13.881 --> 01:34:15.282
ANYTHING THROUGH INDUSTRY SO

01:34:15.349 --> 01:34:17.518
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE ECONOMIC

01:34:17.585 --> 01:34:19.754
IMPACTS THAT WERE INVOLVED IN

01:34:19.820 --> 01:34:23.324
PEOPLE FOR REGULATION TO COMPLY.

01:34:23.391 --> 01:34:25.526
THERE WAS NO COMPASSION

01:34:25.593 --> 01:34:26.627
WHATSOEVER IT WAS ONLY ONE

01:34:26.694 --> 01:34:28.929
GOAL. AND YOU HAD TO COMPLY NO

01:34:28.996 --> 01:34:30.965
MATTER WHAT. I'VE SEEN

01:34:31.032 --> 01:34:33.200
BUSINESSES COMPLETELY

01:34:33.267 --> 01:34:33.834
DEVASTATED BECAUSE OF THE TRUCK

01:34:33.901 --> 01:34:36.337
AND BUS ROLL. PEOPLE LATER ON

01:34:36.404 --> 01:34:37.605
IN LIFE THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO

01:34:37.671 --> 01:34:39.573
RE INVEST. HUNDREDS OF

01:34:39.640 --> 01:34:40.775
THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN

01:34:40.841 --> 01:34:43.077
EQUIPMENT SO THEY CAN FINISH

01:34:43.144 --> 01:34:43.711
OUT THE LAST TWO OR THREE YEARS

01:34:43.778 --> 01:34:50.284
OF THEIR- YOU KNOW WORKING LIFE-

01:34:50.351 --> 01:34:52.286
I AM SO HAPPY THAT WE WERE

01:34:52.353 --> 01:34:52.887
FINALLY I THINK THIS IS THE

01:34:52.953 --> 01:34:58.059
FIRST AUDIT OF THIS AGENCY. L.

01:34:58.125 --> 01:34:59.627
I AM HAPPY AND I CAN'T THINK

01:34:59.693 --> 01:35:02.663
THE STATE AUDITOR AT A NOT FOR

01:35:02.730 --> 01:35:05.499
MAKING THIS. EFFORT WHO IS ALSO

01:35:05.566 --> 01:35:09.437
A FANTASTIC UMPIRE. THROUGH THE

01:35:09.503 --> 01:35:15.276
JOINT BASEBALL SOFTBALL UP BUT-

01:35:15.342 --> 01:35:17.178
MISTER CHAIR ONE OF THE THINGS

01:35:17.244 --> 01:35:19.180
THAT THIS WAS CLEARLY OUTLINED

01:35:19.246 --> 01:35:20.781
IN THE TRANSPORTATION HEARINGS

01:35:20.848 --> 01:35:24.185
IS THIS EXACT EXAMPLE WHAT WAS

01:35:24.251 --> 01:35:24.785
CLEARLY BROUGHT FORWARD IN THE

01:35:24.852 --> 01:35:29.290
A LOT OF. WE HAVE THE ROLE AS A

01:35:29.356 --> 01:35:31.792
AS A BODY TO PROVIDE OVERSIGHT

01:35:31.859 --> 01:35:34.795
FOR THE MONEY THAT IS SPENT.

01:35:34.862 --> 01:35:36.397
WHEN YOU LOOK SENSE CAP AND

01:35:36.464 --> 01:35:39.366
TRADE DISPENSED INSTALLED IN

01:35:39.433 --> 01:35:40.267
TWELVE TWENTY THIRTEEN I THINK

01:35:40.334 --> 01:35:40.868
INVESTMENT WAS STARTING TO BE

01:35:40.935 --> 01:35:45.005
MADE. TWELVE POINT FIVE BILLION

01:35:45.072 --> 01:35:46.707
DOLLARS HAVE BEEN INVESTED TO

01:35:46.774 --> 01:35:49.310
REDUCE I THINK APPROXIMATELY

01:35:49.376 --> 01:35:50.311
FORTY FIVE MILLION METRIC TONS

01:35:50.377 --> 01:35:53.848
OF. CARBON WHICH IS VERY VERY

01:35:53.914 --> 01:35:55.783
BOTTOM PLATES VERY. I AM VERY

01:35:55.850 --> 01:35:59.019
PROUD OF THAT. BUT IN THEIR

01:35:59.086 --> 01:36:00.254
SCOPING PLAN THEY DON'T

01:36:00.321 --> 01:36:01.889
IDENTIFY NATURAL CARBON

01:36:01.956 --> 01:36:05.459
EMISSIONS. AND SO THAT FORTY

01:36:05.526 --> 01:36:07.495
FIVE MILLION METRIC TONS AND

01:36:07.561 --> 01:36:08.028
TWELVE AND A HALF BILLION

01:36:08.095 --> 01:36:10.297
DOLLARS THAT WAS SPENT. WITH

01:36:10.364 --> 01:36:12.800
NEGATED BY THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN

01:36:12.867 --> 01:36:13.934
WILDFIRES IN CALIFORNIA WANT TO

01:36:14.001 --> 01:36:14.568
TALK ABOUT DISADVANTAGED

01:36:14.635 --> 01:36:16.203
COMMUNITIES. EVERYTHING IN

01:36:16.270 --> 01:36:19.573

01:36:19.640 --> 01:36:23.444
COMMUNITY WITH ALL THAT SMOKE.

01:36:23.511 --> 01:36:24.912
SIXTY EIGHT MILLION METRIC TONS

IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN- NEGATING

01:36:27.381 --> 01:36:28.916
SEVEN YEARS OF INVESTMENT.

01:36:28.983 --> 01:36:32.253
SEVEN YEARS WE NEED TO BE ABLE

BIGGEST BANG FOR OUR BUCK AND

01:36:34.488 --> 01:36:36.323
INVESTMENT TAILPIPE EMISSIONS

01:36:36.390 --> 01:36:38.559
ARE IMPORTANT BUT IF YOU KEEP

01:36:38.626 --> 01:36:40.227
THROWING BAD MONEY AFTER GOOD.

01:36:40.294 --> 01:36:41.428

01:38:20.794 --> 01:38:22.296
WE'RE EVALUATING IN THE BUDGET

01:38:22.363 --> 01:38:23.697
YOU KNOW BILLIONS OF DOLLARS

01:38:23.764 --> 01:38:25.299
THAT ARE GOING TO BE GOING TO

01:38:25.366 --> 01:38:26.867
HE'S PROGRAMS BUT WE CAN'T AS A

01:38:26.934 --> 01:38:29.169
LEGISLATURE EVALUATE WHETHER

01:38:29.236 --> 01:38:32.439
THINGS ARE WORKING OR NOT. AND

01:38:32.506 --> 01:38:32.940
YOU KNOW IF YOU'VE GOT.

01:38:33.007 --> 01:38:34.074
PROGRAMS THAT CARVER SAYING

01:38:34.141 --> 01:38:35.809
WORKS BUT THERE'S NO EVIDENCE

01:38:35.876 --> 01:38:37.478
TO BACK IT UP AND THEN THERE.

01:38:37.544 --> 01:38:38.879
BOB GRAHAM'S THAT DON'T HAVE

01:38:38.946 --> 01:38:40.848
ANY DATA WHATSOEVER SO. HOW DO

01:38:40.914 --> 01:38:42.750
I JUST SUPPOSE THAT REALITY

01:38:42.816 --> 01:38:44.318
WITH THE TIMELINESS OF THE FACT

01:38:44.385 --> 01:38:45.519
THAT WE'RE MAKING DECISIONS

01:38:45.586 --> 01:38:48.289
RIGHT NOW. SO AND SO HOW DO I

01:38:48.355 --> 01:38:49.390
HOW DO I EVALUATE THOSE

01:38:49.456 --> 01:38:51.292
RECOMMENDATIONS WERE. YOU

01:38:51.358 --> 01:38:54.561
ASKING FOR AN ANNUAL REPORT.

01:38:54.628 --> 01:38:58.666
BUT WE'RE MAKING DECISIONS NOW.

01:38:58.732 --> 01:39:00.634
I CERTAINLY. HAS WITH THE WITH

01:39:00.701 --> 01:39:02.036
THE CHALLENGE THERE AND I CAN

01:39:02.102 --> 01:39:03.504
ONLY SAY IN TERMS OF THE TIMING

01:39:03.570 --> 01:39:04.571
OF OUR REPORT OUR

01:39:04.638 --> 01:39:06.340
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT THOSE ARE

01:39:06.407 --> 01:39:08.108
ARE IN PART A FUNCTION. WHAT

01:39:08.175 --> 01:39:08.876
KIND OF THE LACK OF A STRONG

01:39:08.942 --> 01:39:10.911
FOUNDATION FOR MANY OF THE

01:39:10.978 --> 01:39:13.447
PROGRAMS- I JUST WANT TO BACK

01:39:13.514 --> 01:39:14.682
UP SLIGHTLY TO CLARIFY THAT I

01:39:14.748 --> 01:39:16.717
THINK. YOU KNOW THERE IS A

01:39:16.784 --> 01:39:18.686
SPECTRUM OF LEVEL OF DIFFICULTY

01:39:18.752 --> 01:39:20.054
POTENTIAL LEVEL OF EFFORT TO

01:39:20.120 --> 01:39:21.522
SOME OF THIS DATA BUT I DON'T

01:39:21.588 --> 01:39:22.523
KNOW THAT WE IDENTIFIED

01:39:22.589 --> 01:39:24.158
REPORTED ON MANY THAT ARE

01:39:24.224 --> 01:39:25.559
SQUARELY WITHIN THE CAR CANNOT

01:39:25.626 --> 01:39:27.828
ACCESS. THAT ARE HAS NO WAY OF

01:39:27.895 --> 01:39:29.663
THE- HEATING OR- IF FOR NO

01:39:29.730 --> 01:39:32.433
OTHER REASON THAN- CARB IS NOT

01:39:32.499 --> 01:39:34.268
DEMONSTRATED THE EFFORT FROM

01:39:34.335 --> 01:39:37.171
OFFER TO DO SO. SO THAT THAT

01:39:37.237 --> 01:39:39.873
LACK OF DATA COLLECTION- THAT

01:39:39.940 --> 01:39:42.009
LACK OF A PROGRAM AND YOU KNOW

01:39:42.076 --> 01:39:44.144
DESIGN OR SYSTEMS BUILT INTO

01:39:44.211 --> 01:39:46.647
PLACE TO BE. HERE IT IS AND TO

01:39:46.714 --> 01:39:48.048
BE RESPONSIVE TO DATA WHEN IT

01:39:48.115 --> 01:39:49.817
COMES AND OTHER P. BEHAVIORAL

01:39:49.883 --> 01:39:56.457
DATA. BUT- BE- THEY ABOUT. THE

01:39:56.523 --> 01:39:57.191
NEW YOU KNOW THE NUMBER OF.

01:39:57.257 --> 01:39:59.059
BEING STOLEN CALIFORNIA RIGHT

01:39:59.126 --> 01:39:59.960
YOU KNOW IT'S A THAT COME TO

01:40:00.027 --> 01:40:01.428
REGULAR. OF TO THE SYSTEM

01:40:01.495 --> 01:40:03.697
THAT'S CURRENTLY BEING USED.

01:40:03.764 --> 01:40:06.767
THE WILL TAKE TIME FOR CAR TO

01:40:06.834 --> 01:40:12.673
PUT IN PLACE. AND TO. TEST YOU

01:40:12.740 --> 01:40:14.708
KNOW THE- THEIR ASSUMPTIONS

01:40:14.775 --> 01:40:16.176
KNOW WE'VE- WE IDENTIFY I THINK

01:40:16.243 --> 01:40:17.077
THE REPORT WHERE THERE'S LOW

01:40:17.144 --> 01:40:19.646
HANGING. AND WE EXPECT TO BE.

01:40:19.713 --> 01:40:21.014
JUDICIOUS IN AND CRY. OF

01:40:21.081 --> 01:40:22.916
GETTING AFTER THAT STUFF FIRST

01:40:22.983 --> 01:40:24.551
AND FOREMOST AND- MAKING- YOU

01:40:24.618 --> 01:40:26.587
KNOW LARGE CONCLUDE. FOR FROM

01:40:26.653 --> 01:40:27.654
THAT THERE COLLECTION THEY IF

01:40:27.721 --> 01:40:30.224
THEY WERE AND THEIR SIR EFFORTS.

01:40:30.290 --> 01:40:30.924
THAN YOU KNOW YOU COULD YOU

01:40:30.991 --> 01:40:32.326
COULD TEST SOME BASIC

01:40:32.393 --> 01:40:33.360
ASSUMPTIONS AT LEAST ON THE

01:40:33.427 --> 01:40:36.597
SUBJECT. SIDE CATCH THE VERY

01:40:36.663 --> 01:40:38.065
QUICKLY. BUT I'M FOR. YES

01:40:38.132 --> 01:40:38.799
THERE'S GOING TO HAVE TO BE

01:40:38.866 --> 01:40:40.367
INTERNET. AND A COMPLEX PROCESS

01:40:40.434 --> 01:40:43.704
DID NOT THAT. SO I THINK YOU

01:40:43.771 --> 01:40:47.241
KNOW. FINANCIER QUESTIONS I CAN

01:40:47.307 --> 01:40:48.542
THERE IS YOU KNOW THE LEGACY OF

01:40:48.609 --> 01:40:49.543
THE TIME LAG BETWEEN WHEN SOME

01:40:49.610 --> 01:40:51.278
OF THESE PROGRAMS HAVE GONE IN.

01:40:51.345 --> 01:40:52.379
PLACE THE MONEY THAT'S BEEN

01:40:52.446 --> 01:40:53.981
SPENT ON THEM AND WHEN WE FIND

01:40:54.047 --> 01:40:55.649
OURSELVES NOW. SO THERE'S A

01:40:55.716 --> 01:40:56.583
LITTLE BIT NOT ISN'T THE

01:40:56.650 --> 01:40:58.385
SITUATION OF MISSED OPPORTUNITY

01:40:58.452 --> 01:41:00.354
WITH RESPECT TO THAT AND- THAT

01:41:00.421 --> 01:41:01.789
WAS CERTAINLY. NOT FRUSTRATING

01:41:01.855 --> 01:41:03.090
TO US AS A TEAM BUT WE TRIED

01:41:03.157 --> 01:41:05.993
TO- BE STRATEGIC AND BE DIRECT

01:41:06.059 --> 01:41:08.295
ABOUT WHERE CARP SHOULD GO IN

01:41:08.362 --> 01:41:10.798
ORDER TO. RECTIFY THAT GOING

01:41:10.864 --> 01:41:13.400
FORWARD. SO I'M I'M- I

01:41:13.467 --> 01:41:15.235
APPRECIATE THAT- AND- THAT

01:41:15.302 --> 01:41:17.438
PERSPECTIVE I GUESS- I KNOW I'M

01:41:17.504 --> 01:41:19.873
GONNA CHANNEL MY- FRUSTRATIONS

01:41:19.940 --> 01:41:22.075
I THINK FOR- THROUGH THE- WHAT

01:41:22.142 --> 01:41:23.377
WAS SAID- TO THE FORMER

01:41:23.444 --> 01:41:24.411
TRANSPORTATION CHAIR OF THE

01:41:24.478 --> 01:41:26.180
ASSEMBLY. THAT YOU KNOW YOU

01:41:26.246 --> 01:41:27.448
WOULD THINK THAT THESE THINGS

01:41:27.514 --> 01:41:27.981
WOULD HAVE BEEN PUT INTO

01:41:28.048 --> 01:41:31.185
MOTION. A DECADE AGO. AND NOW

01:41:31.251 --> 01:41:33.654
WE'RE- OVER A DECADE IN AND WE

01:41:33.720 --> 01:41:35.556
STILL DON'T KNOW OR WE MAY NOT

01:41:35.622 --> 01:41:36.957
HAVE THE ABILITY. TO KNOW

01:41:37.024 --> 01:41:38.258
WHETHER THESE PROGRAMS OR EVEN

01:41:38.325 --> 01:41:40.494
AN ACTIVE OR NOT. AND THEN AT

01:41:40.561 --> 01:41:42.529
THE SAME TIME THE VERY AGENCY

01:41:42.596 --> 01:41:44.064
THAT IS. NOW GONNA COME BEFORE

01:41:44.131 --> 01:41:46.066
US AS A LEGISLATURE IS ASKING

01:41:46.133 --> 01:41:47.568
FOR MORE MONEY. TELLING US TO

01:41:47.634 --> 01:41:48.902
THESE PROGRAMS ARE WORKING WE

01:41:48.969 --> 01:41:50.003
DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE WORKING

01:41:50.070 --> 01:41:52.473
OR NOT- SO I THINK THAT'S THE

01:41:52.539 --> 01:41:54.708
BIG CHALLENGE WE HAVE AS-

01:41:54.775 --> 01:41:56.610

01:42:10.023 --> 01:42:12.459
ALSO. UNDERSTANDING THAT THEY

01:42:12.526 --> 01:42:14.394
MAY NOT BE VERY OBJECTIVE. IN

01:42:14.461 --> 01:42:16.363
TERMS OF WHETHER. THE PROGRAMS

ARE WORKING OR NOT. I'VE NEVER

01:42:18.432 --> 01:42:23.804
HAD AN AGENCY TESTIFIED BEFORE.

01:42:23.871 --> 01:42:24.438

01:45:27.454 --> 01:45:28.789
WHAT CAR DID WAS THE INVERSE OF

01:45:28.855 --> 01:45:30.657
THAT. THEY JUST ASSUMED YOU

01:45:30.724 --> 01:45:32.426
KNOW A SCENARIO IN WHICH FIVE.

01:45:32.492 --> 01:45:34.194
MILLION VEHICLES WILL BE SOLD.

01:45:34.261 --> 01:45:35.362
AND THEN YOU JUST HISTORICAL

01:45:35.429 --> 01:45:37.364
DATA TO SAY WELL WE ON AVERAGE

01:45:37.431 --> 01:45:38.999
PAY FOR ABOUT ONE OUT OF TWO IS

01:45:39.066 --> 01:45:39.766
THAT IS THAT ARE SOLD IN THE

CALIFORNIA. IN CALIFORNIA TO

01:45:41.101 --> 01:45:42.703
SEE THE R. P. THEREFORE WILL

01:45:42.769 --> 01:45:45.205
JUST DO THE MATH. AND SO THAT

01:45:45.272 --> 01:45:47.307
TO US IS A BUDGETING EXERCISE.

01:45:47.374 --> 01:45:49.743
IT'S NOT AN EXERCISE IN TRYING

01:45:49.810 --> 01:45:53.413
TO ACCOMPLISH. WHAT THE PROGRAM

01:45:53.480 --> 01:45:53.980
IS SET TO DO WHICH IS YOU.

01:45:58.118 --> 01:46:00.454
VEHICLE MARKET GOING FORWARD.

01:46:00.520 --> 01:46:03.090

REACH THE GOVERNOR'S GO. I'M

01:46:11.064 --> 01:46:12.332
AFRAID I CANNOT SPEAK TO THAT

01:46:12.399 --> 01:46:13.867
NOW IF CARP WERE TO HAVE

01:46:13.934 --> 01:46:16.069

INVEST NOW TO DRIVE. PRICES

DOWN BUT WE KNOW WHEN WE'VE

01:46:30.751 --> 01:46:33.086
MADE SUFFICIENT- INVESTMENTS

01:46:33.153 --> 01:46:34.221
THAT INCENTIVES MAY NOT KNOW

01:46:34.287 --> 01:46:35.889
HOW TO BE NECESSARY IF I HAD

01:46:35.956 --> 01:46:37.657
DONE THE RESEARCH TO KNOW OUR

01:46:37.724 --> 01:46:39.059
INCENTIVE AMOUNTS THE MOST

01:46:39.126 --> 01:46:40.794
AFFECTED THEY COULD BE. THEN WE

01:46:40.861 --> 01:46:42.596

WE BRING UP THE NEXT PANEL.

01:47:11.391 --> 01:47:13.026
WITH WITH THAT WE'RE GONNA MOVE

BUY IT CONFIRM HERE M. THE

01:47:35.849 --> 01:47:37.184
HEADLINES WERE QUITE DRAMATIC

01:47:37.250 --> 01:47:39.386
EXIT IS NOTHING HERE SHOWS THAT

01:47:39.452 --> 01:47:42.556
CARBS PROGRAMS ARE COURT

01:47:42.622 --> 01:47:43.190
CORRECT WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT

01:47:43.256 --> 01:47:46.393
AN E. D. D. S. SITUATION WITH

01:47:46.459 --> 01:47:49.129
SIGNIFICANT WASTE IT SEEMS LIKE

01:47:49.196 --> 01:47:51.131
THE MAIN FINDING IS THAT CORBYN

01:47:51.198 --> 01:47:54.167
CLICKED AS MUCH DATA AS THEY

01:47:54.234 --> 01:47:55.569
SHOULD- PROBABLY IN. BENEFITS

01:47:55.635 --> 01:47:57.671
AND POSSIBLY COULD BE

01:47:57.737 --> 01:47:59.439
OPTIMIZING THE USE THE FUNDS

01:47:59.506 --> 01:48:02.943
BETTER IS THAT SEPARATE. YES

01:48:03.009 --> 01:48:03.844
THAT'S CORRECT IN THE SENSE

01:48:03.910 --> 01:48:05.078
THAT WE YOU KNOW WE DON'T

01:48:05.145 --> 01:48:06.680
CURRENTLY HAVE SUFFICIENT DATA

01:48:06.746 --> 01:48:08.281
TO MAKE INFORMED DETERMINATIONS

01:48:08.348 --> 01:48:10.417
ABOUT THE RELATIVE BENEFITS OF

01:48:10.483 --> 01:48:11.585
PROGRAMS OR HOW EFFECTIVE THEY

01:48:11.651 --> 01:48:12.819
ARE COMPARED TO OTHER USES

01:48:12.886 --> 01:48:14.421
JEFFERIES OF THE MONEY. FOR

01:48:14.487 --> 01:48:16.223
THAT REASON YOU KNOW WE DON'T

01:48:16.289 --> 01:48:17.390
WE DON'T HAVE ANYWHERE IN OUR

01:48:17.457 --> 01:48:18.925
REPORT RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT

01:48:18.992 --> 01:48:20.260
PROGRAMS THAT SHOULD GO AWAY

01:48:20.327 --> 01:48:20.961
PROGRAMS THAT SHOULD BE

01:48:21.027 --> 01:48:22.629
EXPANDED WE CERTAINLY WOULD

01:48:22.696 --> 01:48:23.763
LOOK TO MAKE THOSE TYPES OF

01:48:23.830 --> 01:48:25.332
RECOMMENDATIONS WHERE THE DATA

01:48:25.398 --> 01:48:27.167
ARE AVAILABLE SO- OUR

01:48:27.234 --> 01:48:28.501
CONCLUSION HERE IS THAT WE

01:48:28.568 --> 01:48:29.903
DON'T KNOW WE HAVE REASON TO

01:48:29.970 --> 01:48:30.871
BELIEVE THAT THERE SOMEWHERE ON

01:48:30.937 --> 01:48:32.706

100% EFFECTIVE AND NOT IT NOT

01:48:34.107 --> 01:48:35.375
EFFECTIVE AT ALL BUT THE

01:48:35.442 --> 01:48:36.877
EVIDENCE REALLY ISN'T ISN'T

01:48:36.943 --> 01:48:37.878

CONTINUE ON A GIVEN PROGRAM

01:48:39.779 --> 01:48:41.548
WOODLAND WHICH OF COURSE

01:48:41.615 --> 01:48:43.250
INHIBITS STATE'S ABILITY TO

01:48:43.316 --> 01:48:47.487
PICK THE WINNERS AND ENSURE WE-

01:48:47.554 --> 01:48:48.455

02:04:28.194 --> 02:04:30.729
EXAMPLE OF CARP USING AND I'M

02:04:30.796 --> 02:04:32.932

02:04:50.382 --> 02:04:51.984
AS DISINGENUOUS AT BEST. GIVEN

RESPONSIVE TO AUDIT FINDINGS.

02:04:59.425 --> 02:05:01.794
FRANKLY I THINK YOUR TRACK

02:05:01.861 --> 02:05:03.262
RECORD GIVES UP CALL FOR ALARM.

02:05:03.329 --> 02:05:05.497
THAT WE ALL SHOULD BE CONCERNED

DESIGNED PROGRAM THAT PROVIDES

02:05:15.007 --> 02:05:17.643
RESULT IN JOB CREATIONS AND

02:05:17.710 --> 02:05:19.278
THAT THOSE JOBS TO BE TRACKED

02:05:19.345 --> 02:05:20.946
THIS IS STATE LAW BUT THREE

02:05:21.013 --> 02:05:23.649
YEARS LATER. IN TWO THOUSAND

02:05:23.716 --> 02:05:24.617
EIGHTEEN CARP UPDATED

CREATION AND TRAINING SHOULD

02:05:27.319 --> 02:05:29.088
FOCUS ON DISADVANTAGED AND LOW

02:05:29.154 --> 02:05:30.956
INCOME COMMUNITIES HOWEVER

02:05:31.023 --> 02:05:33.225
DESPITE ALL THIS TIME. AND

SUPPOSED TO LIVE WORK THAT WAS

02:05:35.361 --> 02:05:37.596
DONE I THOUGHT IT BOB KARP HAS

02:05:37.663 --> 02:05:40.933
FAILED TO DO SO IN A TIMELY AND

02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:42.835
COMPREHENSIVE WAY. THIS AUDIT

COLLECTED BUT NOT REPORTED THIS

02:05:56.615 --> 02:05:58.684
REFLECTS A FUNDAMENTAL FAILURE

02:05:58.751 --> 02:06:00.252
TO DELIVER ON THESE IMPORTANT

02:06:00.319 --> 02:06:02.388

THAT'S ABOUT FOUR YEARS OR

02:12:31.610 --> 02:12:34.212
NEWER AND FAR FAR CLEANER FACT

02:12:34.279 --> 02:12:35.247
THAT THE HIGHEST SELLING

STAYS IN FUTURE. AND SO I WOULD

02:13:03.175 --> 02:13:04.276
IMAGINE THAT MISTER COREY THAT

02:13:04.343 --> 02:13:05.911
WOULD BE THAT CVR P. PRO HELPS

02:13:05.977 --> 02:13:08.747
CAL. REACHES CLIMATE GOALS-

02:13:08.814 --> 02:13:09.481
THAT'S CORRECT ASSUMPTION I'M

02:13:09.548 --> 02:13:11.717
SO. BASED OFF YOUR ANSWER. THAT

02:13:11.783 --> 02:13:15.053
IS OKAY SOMETHING. I JUST WANT

02:13:15.120 --> 02:13:15.620
TO ASK BECAUSE I WAS TO WITH

02:13:15.687 --> 02:13:17.522
OUR BUDGET COMMITTEE AND- THE

02:13:17.589 --> 02:13:18.657
CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE

02:13:18.724 --> 02:13:21.760
MEMBERS AND I'M JUST WONDERING

02:13:21.827 --> 02:13:24.529
IF CARP IS GOING TO BE PUSHING

02:13:24.596 --> 02:13:26.031
FOR AN ALLOCATION OF FUNDS FOR

02:13:26.098 --> 02:13:27.666
THE C. V. R. P. PROGRAM BECAUSE

02:13:27.733 --> 02:13:29.101
IN THE GOVERNOR'S INITIAL

02:13:29.167 --> 02:13:31.803
BUDGET IT'S ELIMINATED. AND SO

02:13:31.870 --> 02:13:33.572
FROM CARBS PERSPECTIVE TRYING

02:13:33.638 --> 02:13:34.973
TO MEET MEET OUR CLIMATE GOALS

02:13:35.040 --> 02:13:37.275
WILL YOU BE PUSHING TO

02:13:37.342 --> 02:13:38.210
REINSTATE THAT MONEY INTO THE

02:13:38.276 --> 02:13:40.946

02:13:42.848 --> 02:13:44.149
COURSES YOU KNOW THE

02:13:44.216 --> 02:13:46.118
ADMINISTRATION IN CONSULTATION

02:13:46.184 --> 02:13:47.986
WITH THE LEGISLATURE THAT'S

02:13:48.053 --> 02:13:48.453
SUBJECT TO A SPECIFIC

02:13:48.520 --> 02:13:50.822
APPROPRIATION- IN A PLAYED OUT

02:13:50.889 --> 02:13:52.290
IN THE BUDGET PROCESS BUT WHAT

02:13:52.357 --> 02:13:54.760
I WOULD SAY IS. WE KNOW WE NEED

02:13:54.826 --> 02:13:55.961
MORE ELECTRIC VEHICLES IN

02:13:56.027 --> 02:13:57.662
LONDON LET ME BE REALLY CLEAR

02:13:57.729 --> 02:13:59.097
ON THIS BECAUSE I THINK THE

02:13:59.164 --> 02:14:02.134
NEXT GUY THE MESSAGE WAS MUTED.

02:14:02.200 --> 02:14:03.568
DURING THE CONVERSATION. NOT

IN NO DOUBT I TALKED ABOUT THE

02:14:23.321 --> 02:14:25.223
FACT WE ARE HAPPY TO COUNTRIES

02:14:25.290 --> 02:14:27.926

UNDERSTAND REGULATION. SO THE

02:22:20.598 --> 02:22:22.500
DEREGULATION IS A MANUFACTURER

02:22:22.567 --> 02:22:24.369
A REQUIREMENT FOR PRODUCTION

02:23:26.064 --> 02:23:27.932
FORESTED IN OUR WATERSHEDS.

02:23:27.999 --> 02:23:29.400
WHICH HAS BEEN SPEWING OUT

02:23:29.467 --> 02:23:31.703
CARBON WE HAD FOUR POINT TWO

02:23:31.769 --> 02:23:33.237
MILLION ACRES LAST YEAR BURNED

02:23:33.304 --> 02:23:35.606

02:23:35.673 --> 02:23:37.442
THE YEARS PASSED SINCE TWO

02:23:37.508 --> 02:23:38.910
THOUSAND TWELVE WE HAD BIGGEST

02:23:38.977 --> 02:23:41.145
FIRES IN THE STATE'S HISTORY.

02:23:41.212 --> 02:23:43.147

02:23:53.858 --> 02:23:55.460
A BILL THAT WILL REQUIRE YOU TO

02:23:55.526 --> 02:23:56.761
COUNT THAT HOPEFULLY WILL GET

02:23:56.828 --> 02:23:58.696

COULD TALK ABOUT THERE'S JUST

02:24:05.670 --> 02:24:07.438

SENATOR BRADFORD. DID A VERY

02:24:09.307 --> 02:24:10.541

FRUSTRATION THAT I THAT THAT IS

02:24:12.877 --> 02:24:13.478
HAPPENING HERE IN THE

02:24:13.544 --> 02:24:16.481

02:24:28.926 --> 02:24:32.764
SAY. AND WE'RE GONNA RELY ON.

02:24:32.830 --> 02:24:33.865
PRETTY SOON. THE COMBUSTIBLE.

02:24:33.931 --> 02:24:36.267

MAGNITUDE OF THE CHALLENGE IT'S

02:24:50.615 --> 02:24:52.250
SIGNIFICANT THERE'S JUST NO

02:24:52.316 --> 02:24:53.217

GONNA GET A SUGAR COAT IT'S-

02:24:54.886 --> 02:24:57.989
EASY. BUT YOU WILL GET THE FACT

02:24:58.056 --> 02:24:59.924

02:28:31.636 --> 02:28:33.804
INITIAL BUDGET BUT OBVIOUSLY WE

02:43:32.135 --> 02:43:33.370
UNDERSTANDING THE QUESTION BUT

02:43:33.436 --> 02:43:34.571
THERE'S BEEN ABOUT FOURTEEN

02:43:34.638 --> 02:43:36.506
WHICH COMPANIES HOW MUCH MONEY

02:43:36.573 --> 02:43:39.776
IS LEFT IN THE PROGRAM. IT

02:43:39.843 --> 02:43:41.311
SHOULD LET ME TRY AND TAKE IT

02:43:41.378 --> 02:43:43.380
STANDS I THINK I AM TRACKING

02:43:43.446 --> 02:43:44.848
THE QUESTION BECAUSE THERE'S

02:43:44.915 --> 02:43:46.016
THREE PROGRAMS THEY WERE TALK

02:43:46.082 --> 02:43:48.652
ABOUT DIFFERENTLY. I WITH

02:43:48.718 --> 02:43:51.621

02:44:01.464 --> 02:44:03.200
MILLION SO BOTH OF THOSE ARE

02:44:03.266 --> 02:44:05.769
ABOUT I AM IN THE BALLPARK DID

02:44:05.835 --> 02:44:06.636
YOU CAN CORRECT ME BUT I THINK

02:44:06.703 --> 02:44:08.838
THAT WAS THE QUESTION IS ONE OF

02:44:08.905 --> 02:44:11.241
THE REMAINING DOLLARS IN THOSE

02:44:11.308 --> 02:44:13.443
TWO PROGRAMS AND THAT THOSE ARE

02:44:13.510 --> 02:44:15.512
APPROXIMATE AND I WILL FOLLOW

02:44:15.579 --> 02:44:16.413
UP WITH THE PRECISE NUMBERS BUT

02:44:16.479 --> 02:44:18.281
THOSE ARE. THOSE ARE PROXIMATE

02:44:18.348 --> 02:44:20.450
ON THE SPOT RESPONSES IT SHOULD

02:44:20.517 --> 02:44:23.186
BE CORRECT. AS I UNDERSTAND

02:44:23.253 --> 02:44:25.689
SYDNEY INDICATED THAT- YOU

02:44:25.755 --> 02:44:28.091

GET READY TO RUN OUT WAS THAT

02:44:32.629 --> 02:44:37.234
CORRECT. I DON'T THIS DINNER

WHICH ARE INTENDED FOR SOCIAL

02:45:31.788 --> 02:45:34.658
ECONOMIC BENEFITS. AUDIT FINDS

02:45:34.724 --> 02:45:37.694
THAT IT WOULD ACCEPT. IT WOULD

02:45:37.761 --> 02:45:39.462
EXPECT CARD TO DEMONSTRATE.

02:45:39.529 --> 02:45:41.831

LET ME OUR FIRST MAKE AN

02:46:13.096 --> 02:46:14.164
IMPORTANT POINT BECAUSE YOUR

02:46:14.230 --> 02:46:18.001

CARS FOR ALL THOSE VEHICLES ARE

02:46:28.111 --> 02:46:28.712
OPERATING IN LOW INCOME

IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. THESE

02:46:41.291 --> 02:46:43.493
DOLLARS SUBSTANTIAL ARE

02:46:43.560 --> 02:46:45.028
CLEANING UP TRUCKS NOT ENOUGH

02:46:45.095 --> 02:46:46.763
DOLLARS BECAUSE THERE ARE A LOT

02:46:46.830 --> 02:46:48.465
OF TRUCKS CLICK GETTING CLEANER

02:46:48.531 --> 02:46:50.367
TRUCKS ON THE ROAD REDUCING

YOUR JOBS QUESTION IT WAS A

02:47:04.147 --> 02:47:05.582
FAIR CRITICISM ARE WE

02:47:05.648 --> 02:47:08.718
COLLECTING DATA FROM CONSUMERS

02:47:08.785 --> 02:47:10.487
THAT PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM

02:47:10.553 --> 02:47:13.289
ABOUT THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS IN

02:47:13.356 --> 02:47:15.558
ADDITION TO THE CALL CLEAN CAR

02:47:15.625 --> 02:47:17.827
THAT THEY GOT. AYE THAT'S

02:47:17.894 --> 02:47:19.462
CHALLENGING AND MY POINT IS

02:47:19.529 --> 02:47:20.530
EITHER GOOD KNOWLEDGE IT

02:47:20.597 --> 02:47:22.432
STRAIGHT UP GETTING THAT DATA

02:47:22.499 --> 02:47:24.234
IT WAS NOT COMPLETE WE NEED TO

02:47:24.300 --> 02:47:28.271
GET IT. AND SOME CONSUMERS MAY

02:47:28.338 --> 02:47:29.606
BE. NOT AS WELL TO SHOW IT

02:47:29.672 --> 02:47:31.307
BECAUSE IT ARE PERSONAL AND

02:47:31.374 --> 02:47:32.976
FOR. RELATED ISSUES BUT- YOU

02:47:33.042 --> 02:47:34.644

THAT ASKED THAT DATE YOU KNOW

02:47:37.547 --> 02:47:38.815
SO IT'S NOT ABOUT THE CLEANER

02:47:38.882 --> 02:47:40.950
VEHICLES YOU'RE GETTING. IT'S

02:47:41.017 --> 02:47:42.452
ABOUT JUST GETTING THE CLEANER

02:47:42.519 --> 02:47:44.721
VEHICLE CREATE OTHER

02:47:44.788 --> 02:47:47.390
OPPORTUNITIES JOBS AND SO ONE

02:47:47.457 --> 02:47:49.426
THAT THAT THAT DATA IS MUCH

02:47:49.492 --> 02:47:52.061
MORE CHALLENGING TO GET OUT AND

02:47:52.128 --> 02:47:55.398
WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS ON. OKAY

02:47:55.465 --> 02:47:57.066
WHAT MISTER CHAIR IF I MAY

THE AUDIT'S FINDINGS ARE JUST

02:48:03.006 --> 02:48:07.911
FINE- THE FACT THAT THIS BODY

02:48:07.977 --> 02:48:09.546
IS IN THE PROCESS OF A DAY OF

02:48:09.612 --> 02:48:11.681
ADOPTING SOME CAP AND TRADE

02:48:11.748 --> 02:48:13.550
EXPENDITURES THEY ARE EARLY

02:48:13.616 --> 02:48:17.020
ACTION. HOW CAN HOW CAN THE

02:48:17.086 --> 02:48:21.991
LEGISLATURE JUSTIFY EXPANDING.

02:48:22.058 --> 02:48:23.460
TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS

02:48:23.526 --> 02:48:24.928
BEFORE THE AUDITORS

OBSERVATION AND I THINK IT'S AN

02:48:39.776 --> 02:48:42.946
IMPORTANT ONE. I CALIFORNIA HAS

02:48:43.012 --> 02:48:44.214

02:48:45.949 --> 02:48:48.685
ENORMOUS PROGRESS UNDENIABLE

02:48:48.751 --> 02:48:51.387
PROGRESS IN IT AS THE
