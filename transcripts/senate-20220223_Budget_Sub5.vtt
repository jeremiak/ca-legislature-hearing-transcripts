00:07:06.526 --> 00:07:08.761
SUBCOMMITTEE NUMBER ONE- AND THE

00:07:08.828 --> 00:07:10.830
DOJ TASK FORCE PROGRAM FUNDING

00:07:10.897 --> 00:07:13.266
WHICH IS ISSUE FOR ON TODAY'S

00:07:13.332 --> 00:07:15.568
AGENDA. REGARDING THE REMAINING

00:07:15.635 --> 00:07:16.836
FUNDING WE RECOMMEND THAT THE

00:07:16.903 --> 00:07:18.437
LEGISLATURE DETERMINED ITS

00:07:18.504 --> 00:07:20.573
HIGHEST. PRIORITY PUBLIC SAFETY

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:23.209
GOALS SPECIFY CLEAR OBJECTIVES

00:07:23.276 --> 00:07:24.844
AND THEN ONLINE FINDING IN A

00:07:24.911 --> 00:07:27.680
MANNER. THAT ENSURES ITS GOALS

00:07:27.747 --> 00:07:29.982
AND OBJECTIVES ARE ACHIEVED. AND

00:07:30.049 --> 00:07:31.050
THIS IS BECAUSE WE FOUND THAT

00:07:31.117 --> 00:07:32.518
THE GOVERNOR'S OVERALL PLAN

00:07:32.585 --> 00:07:34.153
LACKS CLEAR AND SPECIFIC

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:36.222
OBJECTIVES FOR ACHIEVING EACH OF

00:07:36.289 --> 00:07:38.524
ITS STATED GALS- AND WITHOUT

00:07:38.591 --> 00:07:39.826
OBJECTIVES IT MAKES IT DIFFICULT

00:07:39.892 --> 00:07:41.460
FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO ASSESS

00:07:41.527 --> 00:07:42.995
WHETHER THE PROPOSALS WOULD BE.

00:07:43.062 --> 00:07:45.264
EFFECTIVE IN INITIATING OUR

00:07:45.331 --> 00:07:51.070
CALLS- FOR EXAMPLE- THE GOALAND

00:07:51.137 --> 00:07:52.772
THE VARIOUS TYPES OF CRIMINAL

00:07:52.839 --> 00:07:55.274
ACTIVITIES THAT CAN FALL WITHIN

ORGANIZED RETAIL FAST AS DEFINED

00:07:57.343 --> 00:07:59.378
IN CALIFORNIA. AND SO FOR

00:07:59.445 --> 00:08:01.047
EXAMPLE THAT CAN RANGE FROM TWO

00:08:01.113 --> 00:08:03.950
PEOPLE WORKING TOGETHER TO- SHOP

00:08:04.016 --> 00:08:05.818
LEFT AND RETURNED MERCHANDISE

00:08:05.885 --> 00:08:07.053
FOR STORE CREDIT TO A CRIMINAL

00:08:07.119 --> 00:08:08.654
ORGANIZATION THAT IS EXPLOITING

00:08:08.721 --> 00:08:11.023
OR EVEN TRAFFICKING PEOPLE. TO

00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:12.959
STEAL ON ITS BEHALF AND SO

00:08:13.025 --> 00:08:14.026
WITHOUT CLEAR AND SPECIFIC

00:08:14.093 --> 00:08:15.895
OBJECTIVE IT'S OBJECTIVES IT'S

00:08:15.962 --> 00:08:17.430
DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE WHICH OF

00:08:17.496 --> 00:08:19.065
THE VARIOUS TYPES OF CRIMINAL

00:08:19.131 --> 00:08:20.867
ACTIVITIES WITHIN THE REALM OF

00:08:20.933 --> 00:08:22.501
ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT. ARE

00:08:22.568 --> 00:08:24.237
INTENDED TO BE TARGETED BY THE

00:08:24.303 --> 00:08:28.808
GOVERNOR- AND THEN WITHOUT. AND

00:08:28.875 --> 00:08:29.909
KNOWING WHAT ACTIVITIES ARE

00:08:29.976 --> 00:08:31.410
INTENDED TO BE TARGETED IT'S

00:08:31.477 --> 00:08:33.546
DIFFICULT TO IDENTIFY. SPECIFIC

00:08:33.613 --> 00:08:35.815
ACTIONS THAT WOULD MAKE SENSE TO

00:08:35.882 --> 00:08:37.650
EFFECTIVELY PURSUE THOSE

00:08:37.717 --> 00:08:39.085
CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES- OR THOSE

00:08:39.151 --> 00:08:41.187
TARGETED OBJECTIVES WITH LIMITED

00:08:41.254 --> 00:08:43.656
RESOURCES. TO THE EXTENT THAT

00:08:43.723 --> 00:08:44.790
THE LEGISLATURE WANTS TO

00:08:44.857 --> 00:08:46.525
PRIORITIZE CRIME REDUCTION AS

00:08:46.592 --> 00:08:48.961
PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR. CRIME

00:08:49.028 --> 00:08:50.596
DATA SUGGESTS THAT THE

00:08:50.663 --> 00:08:52.164
GOVERNOR'S SPECIFIC GOALS AS

00:08:52.231 --> 00:08:55.234
REFLECTED- IN THE PACKAGE MAY

00:08:55.301 --> 00:08:57.837
NOT BE WELL TARGETED. AND WHILE

00:08:57.904 --> 00:09:00.006
THERE'S NO OFFICIAL DATA ON ALL

00:09:00.072 --> 00:09:02.041
REAL RETAIL THEFT IN CALIFORNIA

00:09:02.108 --> 00:09:04.143
THE CLOSEST REALLY DATA POINT WE

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:07.346
HAVE A SHOPLIFTING- THAT DID

00:09:07.413 --> 00:09:09.548
DECLINED SIGNIFICANTLY BY NEARLY

00:09:09.615 --> 00:09:11.617
30% BETWEEN TWENTY NINETEEN AND

00:09:11.684 --> 00:09:14.420
TWENTY TWENTY. WHICH SOME AMOUNT

00:09:14.487 --> 00:09:16.989
OF THAT DECLINE IS LIKELY DUE TO

00:09:17.056 --> 00:09:18.925
STORE CLOSURES AND PEOPLE MOVING

00:09:18.991 --> 00:09:20.326
HOME DUE TO PUBLIC HEALTH AND

00:09:20.393 --> 00:09:21.594
PUBLIC HEALTH ORDERS STATE

00:09:21.661 --> 00:09:25.731
HOMEOWNERS IN ONE NIGHT. DURING

00:09:25.798 --> 00:09:26.732
THE EARLIER PART OF TWENTY

00:09:26.799 --> 00:09:28.134
TWENTY- AND PRELIMINARY DATA

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:29.535
FROM TWENTY TWENTY ONE DOES

00:09:29.602 --> 00:09:31.370
SUGGEST THAT OVERALL LARCENY

00:09:31.437 --> 00:09:33.406
WHICH INCLUDE SHOPLIFTING IS.

00:09:33.472 --> 00:09:35.808
INCREASING BUT IT HADN'T

00:09:35.875 --> 00:09:38.444
RETURNED AS OF OCTOBER TWENTY

00:09:38.511 --> 00:09:39.378
TWENTY ONE TO PRE PANDEMIC

00:09:39.445 --> 00:09:40.613
LEVELS SO SORT OF THE TAKE AWAY

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:42.548
IS THAT WHILE YES CRIME. MAYBE

00:09:42.615 --> 00:09:44.984
INCREASING OUR RETAILS HAVE MADE

00:09:45.051 --> 00:09:46.419
INCREASING IT APPEARS TO BE IN

00:09:46.485 --> 00:09:49.255
THE CONTEXT OF THAT- I DID

00:09:49.322 --> 00:09:50.957
DURING A PRETTY SIZEABLE DEBT

00:09:51.023 --> 00:09:52.558
DURING THE EARLIER PART OF THE

00:09:52.625 --> 00:09:56.028
PANDEMIC- IN CONTRAST. THE LAST

00:09:56.095 --> 00:09:57.730
COUPLE YEARS- I HAVE SEEN

00:09:57.797 --> 00:10:00.232
INCREASES IN HOMICIDE AGGRAVATED

00:10:00.299 --> 00:10:02.335
ASSAULT AND MOTOR VEHICLE THEFT

00:10:02.401 --> 00:10:07.073
THAT COULD MERIT- ATTENTION. IT

00:10:07.139 --> 00:10:09.308
IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTE

00:10:09.375 --> 00:10:10.376
HOWEVER THAT AND WHILE THERE IS

00:10:10.443 --> 00:10:12.611
NO. DATE LINE OFFICIAL

00:10:12.678 --> 00:10:15.448
STATISTICS- SOME EXPERTS AND

00:10:15.514 --> 00:10:18.684
RETAILERS HAVE OBSERVED AT. AN

00:10:18.751 --> 00:10:21.387
ANECDOTE IT ANECDOTES- HAVE

00:10:21.454 --> 00:10:22.822
POINTED TO INCREASED CRIMINAL

00:10:22.888 --> 00:10:24.557
SOPHISTICATION AND LEVEL OF

00:10:24.623 --> 00:10:26.325
CRAZINESS AND VIOLENCE INVOLVED

00:10:26.392 --> 00:10:27.793
IN INCIDENTS OF RETAIL STAFFED

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:29.261
SO THAT COULD WARRANT AND

00:10:29.328 --> 00:10:30.596
LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION

00:10:30.663 --> 00:10:32.331
ALTHOUGH AS I NOTED THERE ISN'T.

00:10:32.398 --> 00:10:33.432
VERY GOOD INFORMATION ABOUT THE

00:10:33.499 --> 00:10:37.470
SCALE OF THOSE- ISSUES. WE ALSO

00:10:37.536 --> 00:10:39.472
KNOW THAT CRIME DOES TEND TO

00:10:39.538 --> 00:10:42.074
TEND TO VARY BY- PRETTY

00:10:42.141 --> 00:10:43.743
SIGNIFICANTLY SOMETIMES BY

00:10:43.809 --> 00:10:45.244
REGION AND TYPE OF CRIME SO

00:10:45.311 --> 00:10:48.047
WHILE RETAIL THEFT MAY NOT BE OF

00:10:48.114 --> 00:10:50.249
SIGNIFICANT STATEWIDE CONCERN IT

00:10:50.316 --> 00:10:51.317
COULD BE SOMETHING THAT WOULD

00:10:51.384 --> 00:10:53.652
MAKE SENSE TO TARGET- IN

00:10:53.719 --> 00:10:55.321
PARTICULAR AREAS OF THE STATE.

00:10:55.388 --> 00:10:56.455
UNTIL THE LEGISLATURE IS

00:10:56.522 --> 00:10:59.158
INTERESTED IN CRAFTING ITS OWN

00:10:59.225 --> 00:11:00.526
PACKAGE FOCUS ON ADDRESSING

00:11:00.593 --> 00:11:02.194
ADDRESSING CRIME RELATED PUBLIC

00:11:02.261 --> 00:11:04.030
SAFETY GOALS OUR PUBLICATION.

00:11:04.096 --> 00:11:05.698
HAS VARIOUS OPTIONS OF THE

00:11:05.765 --> 00:11:07.066
LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER THAT

00:11:07.133 --> 00:11:08.734
GENERALLY EXPAND ON EXISTING

00:11:08.801 --> 00:11:13.372
PROGRAMS OR- SUGGEST OPTIONS FOR

00:11:13.439 --> 00:11:14.707
. I DIRECTING FUNDING TOWARDS

00:11:14.774 --> 00:11:16.509
RESEARCH BASED TOOLS OR

00:11:16.575 --> 00:11:20.479
STRATEGIES SUCH AS- AMPLE

00:11:20.546 --> 00:11:23.015
CAMERAS ARE USE OF OUR GPS

00:11:23.082 --> 00:11:25.017
TRACKING TECHNOLOGY TO REDUCE

00:11:25.084 --> 00:11:28.354
RETAIL THEFT. FOUR TWO AND MORE

00:11:28.421 --> 00:11:32.324
EFFECTIVELY. ADDRESS IT- AND

00:11:32.391 --> 00:11:34.360
THEN IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO

00:11:34.427 --> 00:11:37.029
NOTE THAT. M. CRIME IS AT A

00:11:37.096 --> 00:11:39.231
HISTORIC LOW RIGHT NOW SO IT

00:11:39.298 --> 00:11:40.800
COULD BE REASONABLE FOR THE

00:11:40.866 --> 00:11:41.267
LEGISLATURE TO SIMPLY

00:11:41.333 --> 00:11:43.936
PRIORITIZE- PUBLIC SAFETY GOALS

00:11:44.003 --> 00:11:45.971
THAT ARE NOT DIRECTLY RELATED TO

00:11:46.038 --> 00:11:48.140
REDUCING CRIME. THAT CONCLUDES

00:11:48.207 --> 00:11:49.575
MY OVER ARCHING COMMENTS AND

00:11:49.642 --> 00:11:51.811
THEN I'LL JUST TURN TO OUR OUR

00:11:51.877 --> 00:11:53.779
TWO MAJOR AND CONCERNS THAT ARE

00:11:53.846 --> 00:11:55.281
SPECIFIC TO THE PROPOSALS ON

00:11:55.347 --> 00:11:57.416
TODAY'S AGENDA. BEFORE I

00:11:57.483 --> 00:11:58.717
CONCLUDE AND THOSE ARE FIRST

00:11:58.784 --> 00:12:00.920
THAT WE'RE CONCERNED THAT THE

00:12:00.986 --> 00:12:02.855
THREE YEAR- PROPOSED THE SEC

00:12:02.922 --> 00:12:04.890
GRANT PROGRAMS WHICH ARE TWO AND

00:12:04.957 --> 00:12:07.593
TWO OF WHICH ARE IN THIS AGENDA

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:09.261
ITEM AND ONE IS IN THE NEXT-

00:12:09.328 --> 00:12:10.663
ITEM WOULD PROVIDE THE SEC WAS

00:12:10.729 --> 00:12:11.697
SIGNIFICANT IMPLEMENTATION

00:12:11.764 --> 00:12:12.631
AUTHORITY AFTER THE BUDGET IS

00:12:12.698 --> 00:12:14.366
ENACTED. AND BECAUSE OF THAT

00:12:14.433 --> 00:12:15.901
IT'S CURRENTLY UNCLEAR HOW THE

00:12:15.968 --> 00:12:16.836
FUNDING WOULD BE ALLOCATED AND

00:12:16.902 --> 00:12:19.572
USED- WHETHER THE PROGRAMS WOULD

00:12:19.638 --> 00:12:21.474
BE EFFECTIVE- AND IT MAKES IT

00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:23.209
HARD TO RULE OUT THAT THE GRANTS

00:12:23.275 --> 00:12:25.244
WOULD NOT- SUPPLANT LOCAL

00:12:25.311 --> 00:12:27.079
FUNDING. FOR EXAMPLE BECAUSE WE

00:12:27.146 --> 00:12:28.380
DON'T KNOW HOW THE FUNDING WOULD

00:12:28.447 --> 00:12:30.282
BE FOR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT WE

00:12:30.349 --> 00:12:32.084
WOULD BE USED IT COULD END UP.

00:12:32.151 --> 00:12:33.385
GOING TO INCREASING LAW

00:12:33.452 --> 00:12:34.920
ENFORCEMENT PATROL OF RETAIL

00:12:34.987 --> 00:12:36.489
LOCATIONS TO PARTICIPATING IN

00:12:36.555 --> 00:12:39.592
TASK FORCES. OR TO PURCHASING

00:12:39.658 --> 00:12:41.227
CAMERAS OR OTHER EQUIPMENT ALL

00:12:41.293 --> 00:12:42.595
OF WHICH COULD HAVE DIFFERENT

00:12:42.661 --> 00:12:44.964
OUTCOMES AND BE- OF THE

00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:45.397
DIFFERENT LEVELS OF

00:12:45.464 --> 00:12:47.433
EFFECTIVENESS. AND THEN SECOND

00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:48.801
CERTAIN PROPOSALS MAY NOT BE

00:12:48.868 --> 00:12:50.369
TARGETED OR EXCUSE ME MAY NOT BE

00:12:50.436 --> 00:12:51.871
STRUCTURED TO ACHIEVE THEIR

00:12:51.937 --> 00:12:54.073
DESIRED OUTCOMES. FOR EXAMPLE

00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:56.108
THE CHP ORGANIZED RETAIL CRIME

00:12:56.175 --> 00:12:57.610
TASK FORGET FORCE EXPANSION

00:12:57.676 --> 00:12:59.311
COULD FACE CHALLENGES BECAUSE

00:12:59.378 --> 00:13:01.147
HE- C. H. P. CURRENTLY DOES NOT

00:13:01.213 --> 00:13:02.681
HAVE THE ABILITY TO DEDICATE

00:13:02.748 --> 00:13:04.650
FULL TIME OFFICERS TO THE

00:13:04.717 --> 00:13:06.185
PROPOSED NEW TASK FORCE IT'S-

00:13:06.252 --> 00:13:07.887
DUE TO A HIGH. THEY CAN SEE RATE

00:13:07.953 --> 00:13:10.156
WHICH WE- ARE CONCERNED COULD

00:13:10.222 --> 00:13:12.191
IMPACT THE OUTCOMES ACHIEVED.

00:13:12.258 --> 00:13:14.293
AND THEN WE KNOW THAT DOJ DOES

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:15.895
HAVE EXISTING EXPERIENCE IN

00:13:15.961 --> 00:13:17.429
MANAGING TASK FORCES-

00:13:17.496 --> 00:13:19.598
PARTICULARLY THOSE. TARGETING

00:13:19.665 --> 00:13:21.133
COORDINATED CRIMINAL GANGS ARE

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:23.402
NETWORKS AND SO DOJ COULD BE A

00:13:23.469 --> 00:13:25.104
BETTER AND- ENTITY TO ADMINISTER

00:13:25.171 --> 00:13:26.639
THE ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT TASK

00:13:26.705 --> 00:13:28.641
FORCES. THAT CONCLUDES MY

00:13:28.707 --> 00:13:34.280
COMMENTS AND. I'M AVAILABLE FOR

00:13:34.346 --> 00:13:36.015
QUESTIONS THANK YOU. I THANK YOU

00:13:36.081 --> 00:13:38.884

THANK YOU FOR THE MANAGER JUST A

00:13:49.428 --> 00:13:52.231
QUESTION FOR THE ADMINISTRATION-

THE NOTICING IN- TO THE L. A. O-

00:13:56.402 --> 00:13:57.836
IT JUST SEEMS LIKE THERE'S MORE

00:13:57.903 --> 00:13:59.371
QUESTIONS THAN ANSWERS.

00:13:59.438 --> 00:14:01.207
REGARDING THE IMPLEMENTATION SO

00:14:01.273 --> 00:14:02.608
I DID THIS BUT I KIND OF HAD A

00:14:02.675 --> 00:14:04.443
SIMILAR REACTION PARTICULARLY TO

00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:07.246
THE FIRST. PIECE OF THIS THE

00:14:07.313 --> 00:14:09.081
EIGHTY FIVE MILLION OF EIGHTY

00:14:09.148 --> 00:14:09.615
FIVE MILLION DOLLAR GRANT

00:14:09.682 --> 00:14:11.917
PROGRAM. TO LOCAL LAW

00:14:11.984 --> 00:14:15.154
ENFORCEMENT IS I'M JUST TRYING

00:14:15.221 --> 00:14:17.890
TO GET IN I IDEA. AS TO WHAT THE

00:14:17.957 --> 00:14:20.326
VISION IS FOR THE FLOW OF THOSE

00:14:20.392 --> 00:14:22.361
DOLLARS IT IS EIGHTY FIVE

00:14:22.428 --> 00:14:24.330
MILLION DOLLARS IN GRANTS

00:14:24.396 --> 00:14:26.198
DIRECTLY TO CITIES AND COUNTIES

00:14:26.265 --> 00:14:28.300
FOR EXAMPLE AND THEN THE IDEAS

00:14:28.367 --> 00:14:30.236
THAT THEY WOULD DECIDE. HOW TO

00:14:30.302 --> 00:14:33.172
BEST DEPLOY THOSE DOLLARS.

00:14:33.239 --> 00:14:34.974
THROUGH THERE ONE FOR SOME

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:35.808
ORGANIZATIONS OR- IS IT GOING TO

00:14:35.874 --> 00:14:37.776
BE MORE SPECIFICITY I'M A TRYING

00:14:37.843 --> 00:14:41.814
TO IMAGINE. HOW RETAIL. TENDS TO

00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:43.983
WORK- IN RELATION TO LAW

00:14:44.049 --> 00:14:47.753
ENFORCEMENT- IN OUR ARIAN IN

00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:50.356
PENCIL CAN VALUE TENDS TO BE-

00:14:50.422 --> 00:14:52.825
RESERVE OFFICERS WHO ARE

00:14:52.891 --> 00:14:55.394
ACTUALLY DIRECTLY PAID FOR BY

00:14:55.461 --> 00:14:57.363
THE CITY BUT ARE PAID FOR-

00:14:57.429 --> 00:14:59.131
TYPICALLY RETIREES THAT ARE PAID

00:14:59.198 --> 00:15:01.400
FOR THROUGH A SEPARATE

00:15:01.467 --> 00:15:03.535
ORGANIZATION AND OBVIOUSLY A LOT

00:15:03.602 --> 00:15:08.440
OF RETAILERS- AS WE ALL KNOW-

00:15:08.507 --> 00:15:09.041
REALLY PROVIDE THEIR SECURITY

00:15:09.108 --> 00:15:11.844
THROUGH- THROUGH PRIVATE

00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:15.080
SECURITY SERVICES- THE DATE THEY

00:15:15.147 --> 00:15:18.550
DEPLOY AND THAT THEY MANAGE-

00:15:18.617 --> 00:15:20.586
PRESUMABLY I'LL JUST SAY. IT'S

00:15:20.653 --> 00:15:21.987
NOT PART OF MY QUESTION BUT I

00:15:22.054 --> 00:15:23.856
WOULD ASSUME THAT BETWEEN THERE

00:15:23.922 --> 00:15:25.858
AREN'T. FOR MOST RETAILERS

00:15:25.924 --> 00:15:26.959
BETWEEN THEIR INSURERS AND THEIR

00:15:27.026 --> 00:15:29.561
OWN. RISK ANALYSIS LOSS

00:15:29.628 --> 00:15:32.398
PREVENTION THEY WOULD INVEST IN-

00:15:32.464 --> 00:15:33.999
IN EITHER RESERVISTS OR OR

00:15:34.066 --> 00:15:36.068
SECURITY OFFICERS THEMSELVES

00:15:36.135 --> 00:15:38.604
THAT SAID. LET ME JUST GO BACK

00:15:38.671 --> 00:15:40.506
TO THE SIMPLE QUESTION HOW WILL

00:15:40.572 --> 00:15:42.174
THIS MONEY FLOW TO CITIES AND

00:15:42.241 --> 00:15:46.278
COUNTIES IS AT THE IDEA. I'M NOT

00:15:46.345 --> 00:15:47.813
SURE THIS IS KATIE HOW ARE WE

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:50.883
YES YOU SEE I'D LIKE TO JUMP IN

00:15:50.949 --> 00:15:53.886
IF THAT'S OKAY WITH YOU AT-

00:15:53.952 --> 00:15:55.954
CENTER CORTESE HI GOOD AFTERNOON

00:15:56.021 --> 00:15:57.489
KATIE HOWARD WITH THE ARTISTIC

00:15:57.556 --> 00:16:00.459
COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS- I WOULD

00:16:00.526 --> 00:16:02.261
OBSERVE GENERALLY. THAT OFTEN

00:16:02.328 --> 00:16:04.330
WHAT HAPPENS AS- THE GOVERNOR

00:16:04.396 --> 00:16:07.266
PROPOSES NEW KINDS OF GRANT- YOU

00:16:07.333 --> 00:16:08.367
GUYS GRANTS IN A VARIETY OF

00:16:08.434 --> 00:16:10.002
DIFFERENT AREAS THAT HE HAS TO

00:16:10.069 --> 00:16:11.770
SEE IF MINISTERS. THERE MIGHT BE

00:16:11.837 --> 00:16:13.238
A BROAD GOALS STATED INITIALLY

00:16:13.305 --> 00:16:15.174
AND THEN AS WE WORK THROUGH THE-

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:17.142
SUBCOMMITTEE HEARING PROCESS AND

00:16:17.209 --> 00:16:18.544
GET MORE INPUT FROM THE

00:16:18.610 --> 00:16:19.945
LEGISLATURE AND CERTAINLY THE

00:16:20.012 --> 00:16:21.980
ANALYSIS OF THE- ALLEY- MAKES A

00:16:22.047 --> 00:16:23.315
LOT OF SENSE. YOU KNOW I THINK

00:16:23.382 --> 00:16:25.617
AS WELL THAT WE OUGHT TO BE-

00:16:25.684 --> 00:16:27.419
SPECIFYING WHAT THE OBJECTIVES

00:16:27.486 --> 00:16:30.055
ARE HERE- TO THE FIRST PART OF

00:16:30.122 --> 00:16:32.091
YOUR QUESTION CENTER CORTESE.

00:16:32.157 --> 00:16:34.460
IS- THE- GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES

00:16:34.526 --> 00:16:36.028
ARE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE THIS

00:16:36.095 --> 00:16:37.396
FUNDING IN TERMS OF THE EIGHTY

00:16:37.463 --> 00:16:38.797
FIVE. MILLION DOLLAR PORTION

00:16:38.864 --> 00:16:40.699
WHICH IS. ANNUALLY FOR THREE

00:16:40.766 --> 00:16:42.835
YEARS AND YOU KNOW. WHAT THE

00:16:42.901 --> 00:16:44.203
ELIGIBLE ENTITIES WOULD BE

00:16:44.269 --> 00:16:45.838
POLICE DEPARTMENTS AT THE CITY

00:16:45.904 --> 00:16:47.706
LEVEL AND THEN. THE SHERIFFS AND

00:16:47.773 --> 00:16:49.942
PROBATION DEPARTMENTS. AND HOW

00:16:50.008 --> 00:16:53.445
THE DSCC MINISTERS GRANTS-

00:16:53.512 --> 00:16:55.547
PARTICULARLY COMPETITIVE GRANTS.

00:16:55.614 --> 00:16:57.883
AND WHEN WE GET INTO- ITEM TOO I

00:16:57.950 --> 00:16:59.651
MIGHT MAKE SOME OF THE SAME

00:16:59.718 --> 00:17:01.687
POINTS- FOR EXAMPLE THE-

00:17:01.754 --> 00:17:02.721
CALIFORNIA VIOLENCE INTERVENTION

00:17:02.788 --> 00:17:04.390
AND PREVENTION GRANT CELTIC I

00:17:04.456 --> 00:17:05.491
THINK THAT'S A GOOD. SORT OF

00:17:05.557 --> 00:17:07.292
PARALLEL WE HAVE WHAT WE CALL AN

00:17:07.359 --> 00:17:08.494
EXECUTIVE STEERING COMMITTEE

00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:10.963
PROCESS I KNOW MANY MEMBERS OF

00:17:11.029 --> 00:17:12.030
THE SUBCOMMITTEE ARE AWARE AS

00:17:12.097 --> 00:17:13.399
WELL AS MY- COLLEAGUES ON THE

00:17:13.465 --> 00:17:15.701
PANEL. WE BRING TOGETHER SUBJECT

00:17:15.768 --> 00:17:17.436
MATTER EXPERTS TO COME TOGETHER

00:17:17.503 --> 00:17:20.372
AND CRAFT A GRANT PROPOSAL SO

00:17:20.439 --> 00:17:22.975
THEY SET OUT- ALL THE SPECIFICS

00:17:23.041 --> 00:17:24.209
IN TERMS OF WHO'S ELIGIBLE TO

00:17:24.276 --> 00:17:25.677
APPLY BUT THE GRANT AMOUNTS CAN

00:17:25.744 --> 00:17:28.013
BE AND THEN. AS YOU WERE ASKING

00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:30.482
ABOUT. WHAT KINDS OF ACTIVITIES

00:17:30.549 --> 00:17:32.351
AND PROGRAMS AND THINGS WOULD BE

00:17:32.418 --> 00:17:33.952
SUPPORTED THIS FINDING. THE

00:17:34.019 --> 00:17:35.854
DEVELOPMENT OF A COMPETITIVE

00:17:35.921 --> 00:17:37.823
GRANT WITH LATE ALL OF THOSE

00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:40.125
THINGS OUT. SO I THINK THERE'S

00:17:40.192 --> 00:17:41.927
SOME REALLY GOOD BALANCE BETWEEN

00:17:41.994 --> 00:17:43.962
THE LEGISLATURE BY ALL MEANS

00:17:44.029 --> 00:17:47.199
FEEL FREE TO. FURTHER SPECIFY OR

00:17:47.266 --> 00:17:49.968
EVEN PERHAPS. TIGHTEN THE FOCUS

00:17:50.035 --> 00:17:59.878
AROUND. ORGANIZED RETAIL STAFF

00:17:59.945 --> 00:18:03.515
BEING THE- CONCERN. IT RAISED

00:18:03.582 --> 00:18:04.383
MAKES SENSE TO ME WE TALKING

00:18:04.450 --> 00:18:06.485
ABOUT THE IN X. OBVIOUSLY LOT OF

00:18:06.552 --> 00:18:07.453
PEOPLE ARE AWARE OF THIS AND

00:18:07.519 --> 00:18:08.554
GRABS THE HAD BEEN OVER LAST

00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:10.255
SEVERAL MONTHS AND GET MY MORE

00:18:10.322 --> 00:18:12.658
DRAMATIC WAY BUT- OUR GRAND WITH

00:18:12.724 --> 00:18:14.927
LATE OUT- QUITE ON COULD

00:18:14.993 --> 00:18:16.261
PROPOSALS WOULD BE SO. AN

00:18:16.328 --> 00:18:17.930
THERE'S ALL- YOU KNOW LANGUAGE

00:18:17.996 --> 00:18:19.231
OUR CREDIT THAT WOULD

00:18:19.298 --> 00:18:21.133
DISAPPOINTING CONCERN YEAH I

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:22.801
AGREE IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE THAT

00:18:22.868 --> 00:18:24.303
A NEW GRANT PROGRAM WOULD PAY

00:18:24.369 --> 00:18:25.671
FOR THINGS THAT ENTITIES COULD

00:18:25.737 --> 00:18:27.906
BE FINDING ANYWAY THE IDEA HERE

00:18:27.973 --> 00:18:30.275
IS LIKE YES IS TO HAVE NEW

00:18:30.342 --> 00:18:32.311
TARGETED RESPONSIVE ACTIVITIES

00:18:32.377 --> 00:18:36.715
TO THIS. ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT

00:18:36.782 --> 00:18:37.850
CONCERN. JUST A FEW THOUGHTS

00:18:37.916 --> 00:18:39.818
HAPPY TO TAKE ANY OTHER. THANK

00:18:39.885 --> 00:18:40.419
YOU. AND THEN TAKE A FOR THE

00:18:40.486 --> 00:18:44.056
THOROUGH- A MUCH BEYOND MY

00:18:44.122 --> 00:18:46.525
EXPECTATION- EIGHT I APPRECIATE

00:18:46.592 --> 00:18:48.093
THE VISION FOR HOW THINGS WILL

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:49.027
WORK AND THEN HOW.

00:18:49.094 --> 00:18:50.462
IMPLEMENTATION SO SECURE

00:18:50.529 --> 00:18:52.798
COMMUNICATION. CRITERIA OR GRANT

00:18:52.865 --> 00:18:55.033
WRITING CRITERIA WILL COME.

00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:56.902
SHORTLY AFTER THE LEGISLATION.

00:18:56.969 --> 00:18:59.371
AND IT IS TO THE INVITATION FOR

00:18:59.438 --> 00:19:01.874
ANY. LEGISLATIVE COMMENT-

00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:04.643
GUIDELINES ON THIS OR DIRECTION-

00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:05.811
I'M NOT SURE HOW THAT WILL

00:19:05.878 --> 00:19:07.579
UNFOLD THROUGH A LARGER. A

00:19:07.646 --> 00:19:10.516
BUDGET COMMITTEE- AS INTO

00:19:10.582 --> 00:19:13.485
ARCHER- I'M SHOULD BE A LOT OF

00:19:13.552 --> 00:19:14.386
DIFFERENCE TORTURE ON THIS BUT I

00:19:14.453 --> 00:19:16.421

00:19:18.824 --> 00:19:20.759
ABOUT REDUNDANCY WITH. WHATEVER

00:19:20.826 --> 00:19:24.229
INSURANCE FOR. INSURERS IN IN

WELL HEELED WITH RETAILERS ARE

00:19:25.797 --> 00:19:27.699
DOING ON THEIR OWN. THE IDEA

00:19:27.766 --> 00:19:29.635
THAT IT IS GOING TO RUN THROUGH

00:19:29.701 --> 00:19:30.769
THE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES

00:19:30.836 --> 00:19:33.805
BECAUSE I THINK- THAT TAKES CARE

00:19:33.872 --> 00:19:35.407
OF A WHOLE LOT OF OTHER ISSUES.

00:19:35.474 --> 00:19:38.744
RELATIVE TO. THE WAGES- BENEFITS

00:19:38.810 --> 00:19:44.616
CONCERNS. LIKE THAT THAT THAT WE

GOVERNOR'S INTENT FOR SURE BUT I

00:19:55.961 --> 00:19:57.296
JUST WANT TO EXPRESS MY

00:19:57.362 --> 00:20:00.098
AFFIRMATION OF THAT IDEA I THINK

00:20:00.165 --> 00:20:02.568
ONCE YOU'RE COMING THROUGH THE

00:20:02.634 --> 00:20:04.970

THEY WANT TO APPLY FOR A

COMPETITIVE GRANTS SO THEY WOULD

00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:31.089
KNOW IN A PARTICULAR. DEPARTMENT

00:21:31.156 --> 00:21:32.624

WOULD SAY IS- IT'S NOT AS IF.

00:21:59.051 --> 00:22:00.652

00:29:16.020 --> 00:29:16.721
DISTRICT ATTONEY'S OFFICE IT

00:29:16.788 --> 00:29:18.490
DOESN'T MATTER. HOW IS GIVING

00:29:18.556 --> 00:29:19.557
THEM ADDITIONAL FUNDING AND

00:29:19.624 --> 00:29:22.694
ALLOW THEM TO PROSECUTE AGAINST

00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:24.963
THE LAW THAT DOESN'T ALLOW YOU

00:29:25.029 --> 00:29:26.798
TO PROSECUTE THESE INDIVIDUALS

00:29:26.865 --> 00:29:28.800
AND PROP A PROPOSITION THAT

00:29:28.867 --> 00:29:30.502
DOESN'T ALLOW YOU TO PROSECUTE

00:29:30.568 --> 00:29:33.071
THESE INDIVIDUALS THAT'S WHAT

00:29:33.138 --> 00:29:34.739
I'M TRYING TO FIND OUT. AND I

00:29:34.806 --> 00:29:37.675
THINK- THE ADMINISTRATION IS- IT

00:29:37.742 --> 00:29:40.211
IS FOCUSING ON THE CRIME OF

00:29:40.278 --> 00:29:41.946
ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT WHICH IS

00:29:42.013 --> 00:29:43.781
IN A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT LANE

00:29:43.848 --> 00:29:46.317
IF YOU WELL. FROM OTHER KINDS OF

00:29:46.384 --> 00:29:48.620
FAST- AND OF COURSE DISTRICT

00:29:48.686 --> 00:29:51.723
ATTORNEYS- WELL I WOULD. RATHER

00:29:51.789 --> 00:29:52.957
NOT GET INTO ALL THE CHALLENGES

00:29:53.024 --> 00:29:54.792
DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S FACE BUT IT

00:29:54.859 --> 00:29:56.895
IS IT IS CLEAR THAT WHEN IT

00:29:56.961 --> 00:29:58.163
COMES TO ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT

00:29:58.229 --> 00:29:59.931
THERE'S A LOT. OF WORK THAT CAN

00:29:59.998 --> 00:30:01.533
BE DONE AND THAT'S WHAT THIS

00:30:01.599 --> 00:30:04.102
GRANT GOES AFTER. DIRECTLY AND

00:30:04.169 --> 00:30:05.436
SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT YOU

00:30:05.503 --> 00:30:07.105
RAISE ARE SIMPLY OUTSIDE OF THE

00:30:07.172 --> 00:30:09.174
SCOPE OF THIS GRANT. OKAY SO

00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:11.209
JUST AND THEN ONE MORE QUESTION.

00:30:11.276 --> 00:30:12.877

COUNTRY THAT'S THE GOVERNOR'S

00:30:22.086 --> 00:30:24.255

HONEST WITH YOU WHEN THE LAW WAS

00:36:53.311 --> 00:36:54.345
IMPLEMENTED IN TWO THOUSAND

00:36:54.412 --> 00:36:56.447
NINETEEN- WE ASK YOURSELF THE

00:36:56.514 --> 00:36:58.082
SAME QUESTION WHAT IS THE HARD

00:36:58.149 --> 00:36:59.250
DRIVE TO BE WITH RETAIL THEFT

00:36:59.317 --> 00:37:01.519
BUT- ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT WAS

00:37:01.586 --> 00:37:03.554
A NEW CRIME. AND A LEGISLATOR

00:37:03.621 --> 00:37:05.756
ASKED US TO TAKE ON ESTABLISHING

00:37:05.823 --> 00:37:07.291
THE STATE TASK FORCE WHICH ARE

00:37:07.358 --> 00:37:09.260
NOT NEW TO US AND WE DO HAVE

00:37:09.327 --> 00:37:11.562
EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE IN RUNNING

00:37:11.629 --> 00:37:14.632
TASK FORCE BUT TODAY WE HAVE TWO

00:37:14.699 --> 00:37:16.100
HUNDRED FOUR MEMBERS SERVING ON

00:37:16.167 --> 00:37:16.667
NINETY SEVEN DIFFERENT TASK

00:37:16.734 --> 00:37:20.104
FORCE. MANY OF WHICH WE TAKE THE

00:37:20.171 --> 00:37:21.238
LEAD ROLE ON. AND I JUST WANT TO

00:37:21.305 --> 00:37:22.873
BRAG A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT OUR

00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:25.543
FOCUS IS DONE WITH RETAIL THEFT

00:37:25.610 --> 00:37:32.283
SINCE. TWENTY NINETEEN- WE- IN

00:37:32.350 --> 00:37:33.551
OVERNIGHT OR AT RETAIL CRIME BUT

00:37:33.618 --> 00:37:34.752
- FREE. TWENTY POINTS MILLION

00:37:34.819 --> 00:37:36.787
DOLLARS IN STORE MERCHANDISE AND

00:37:36.854 --> 00:37:38.122
HAVE MADE THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY

00:37:38.189 --> 00:37:40.891
EIGHT. ARRESTS IN RESULTS THAT.

00:37:40.958 --> 00:37:42.059
I THINK IN OUR EXPERIENCE WE

00:37:42.126 --> 00:37:44.495
FOUND THAT- THAT'S THERE'S A LOT

00:37:44.562 --> 00:37:45.863
MORE WORK OUT THERE TO DO.

00:37:45.930 --> 00:37:47.264
THERE'S THE ABILITY TO EXPAND

00:37:47.331 --> 00:37:49.266
INTO OUR OUR VALLEY AND INTO THE

00:37:49.333 --> 00:37:51.469
CENTRAL VALLEY- AND WE THINK

00:37:51.535 --> 00:37:54.739
THAT'S IMPORTANT REASON THAT-

00:37:54.805 --> 00:37:55.706
RUSSIAN ABOUT THE OVERTIME AND

00:37:55.773 --> 00:37:58.042
THE STAFFING- WE TALKED AOUT

00:37:58.109 --> 00:37:59.710
YESTERDAY WE DO HAVE SIGNIFICANT

00:37:59.777 --> 00:38:00.811
VACANCY ISSUES THAT WE'RE

00:38:00.878 --> 00:38:01.912
DEALING WITH ABOUT A THOUSAND

00:38:01.979 --> 00:38:04.915
VACANCIES. ON THE OFFICER RANKS

00:38:04.982 --> 00:38:07.318
AND ARE ASKING IS THAT WE WOULD

00:38:07.385 --> 00:38:12.089
USE THIS FUNDING TO- USE OVER

00:38:12.156 --> 00:38:12.757
TIME TO KIND OF BRIDGE THAT GAP.

00:38:12.823 --> 00:38:14.325
BEFORE WE GET TO THE NEXT OF

00:38:14.392 --> 00:38:15.426
WINE AND THEN AS WE FILL THOSE

00:38:15.493 --> 00:38:17.128
VACANCIES WILL DEVOTE RESOURCES

00:38:17.194 --> 00:38:18.629
TOWARDS THESE GENES IN THOSE

00:38:18.696 --> 00:38:22.466
AREAS AND WITHOUT COMPROMISING

BE PAID ATTENTION TO AND THAT

00:40:46.177 --> 00:40:47.511
THAT'S AN IMPORTANT PRIORITY

00:40:47.578 --> 00:40:50.681

00:41:30.888 --> 00:41:33.057
PROPOSAL NEEDING TO STATE THEIR

00:41:33.123 --> 00:41:34.992

WOULD COME BACK TO IS- I'M NOT

00:42:12.329 --> 00:42:13.631
CONVINCED THAT WE HAVE

00:42:13.697 --> 00:42:17.301
ESTABLISHED THE BASIS FOR THIS

00:42:17.368 --> 00:42:19.136
TYPE OF INVESTMENT WE HAVEN'T

00:51:34.057 --> 00:51:35.192
ENTERTAINED ITEM FOR THE-

00:51:35.258 --> 00:51:36.760
RESTORATION IS THAT THE GOAL.

00:51:36.827 --> 00:51:38.495
BROADLY IS TO REDUCE THE NUMBER

00:51:38.562 --> 00:51:39.863
OF FIREARMS NOT NECESSARILY

00:51:39.930 --> 00:51:41.731

THAT FINDING THIS STATEWIDE

00:51:51.775 --> 00:51:53.243
EFFORT WOULD NOT ONLY REDUCE THE

00:51:53.310 --> 00:51:55.078
NUMBER OF FIREARMS BOTH THOSE

00:51:55.145 --> 00:51:57.214
THAT POTENTIALLY MAY HAVE BEEN

00:51:57.280 --> 00:51:59.416
OR POTENTIALLY COULD BE INVOLVED

IT'S REALLY ACCOMPLISHING THE

00:55:59.155 --> 00:56:02.125
SAME KIND OF A GOAL SO. THOSE

00:56:02.192 --> 00:56:04.027
ARE THAT'S MY TWO CENTS ON THE

00:56:04.094 --> 00:56:07.230

COLLEAGUE MISTER O'NEILL

01:01:19.175 --> 01:01:20.710
MENTIONS- THIS IS ONE OF THE

01:01:20.777 --> 01:01:22.211
PROPOSALS THAT WE EVALUATED AS

01:01:22.278 --> 01:01:23.312
PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S PUBLIC

01:01:23.379 --> 01:01:25.948
SAFETY PLAN- WE DID IN OUR

01:01:26.015 --> 01:01:28.084
REVIEW- I RECOMMEND THAT THE

01:01:28.151 --> 01:01:29.819
LEGISLATURE CONSIDER APPROVING

01:01:29.886 --> 01:01:32.255
MASS AS IT WOULD MAINTAIN DOJ'S

01:01:32.321 --> 01:01:34.257
PARTICIPATION OF TASK FORCES TO

01:01:34.323 --> 01:01:35.525
DEAL WITH THESE COMPLEX AND

01:01:35.591 --> 01:01:37.393
MULTI JURISDICTIONAL.

01:01:37.460 --> 01:01:38.761
INVESTIGATIONS THAT COULD HAVE

01:01:38.828 --> 01:01:41.030
BOTH STATEWIDE AND REGIONAL

01:01:41.097 --> 01:01:42.999
REGIONAL BENEFITS THIS IS REALLY

01:01:43.066 --> 01:01:44.167
BECAUSE EACH OF THE

01:01:44.233 --> 01:01:46.836
PARTICIPATING AGENCIES IS PAYING

01:01:46.903 --> 01:01:48.337
FOR THE COSTS OF THE INDIVIDUALS

01:01:48.404 --> 01:01:50.506
THAT ARE PARTICIPATING- AND THIS

01:01:50.573 --> 01:01:52.175
REALLY PROVIDES INCENTIVE TO

01:01:52.241 --> 01:01:54.944
ENSURE THAT EACH TASK FORCE IS

01:01:55.011 --> 01:01:56.746
FOCUSING ON INVESTIGATING THOSE

01:01:56.813 --> 01:01:58.314
CRIMES THAT ARE OF THE HIGHEST

01:01:58.381 --> 01:01:59.949
PRIORITY ALL OF THE

01:02:00.016 --> 01:02:01.484
PARTICIPATING MEMBERS WHICH ARE

01:02:01.551 --> 01:02:02.485
GENERALLY THOSE THAT ARE THE

01:02:02.552 --> 01:02:05.321
MOST PRESSING ENTER THE MOST

01:02:05.388 --> 01:02:07.223
COMPLEX. AND CERTAINLY WITH THAT

01:02:07.290 --> 01:02:08.424
WHEN YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT YOUR

01:02:08.491 --> 01:02:10.293
HIGHEST PUBLIC SAFETY PUBLIC

01:02:10.359 --> 01:02:12.495
SAFETY GOALS- ONE OF THE THINGS

01:02:12.562 --> 01:02:14.497
THAT WE TALKED ABOUT WERE-

01:02:14.564 --> 01:02:16.332
THINGS LIKE RETAIL FAST OR YOU

01:02:16.399 --> 01:02:17.500
KNOW PARTICULAR INCREASES IN

01:02:17.567 --> 01:02:21.070
CRIME- OUTSIDE OF RETAILFAST.

01:02:21.137 --> 01:02:22.405
AND SO SOME OF THAT MIGHT

01:02:22.472 --> 01:02:23.873
DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTS

01:02:23.940 --> 01:02:25.208
CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS OF THE

01:02:25.274 --> 01:02:26.409
LEGISLATURE THINKS THAT THAT'S A

01:02:26.476 --> 01:02:27.944
PRIORITY TO ADDRESS THAT

01:02:28.010 --> 01:02:30.213
INEQUITY IT COULD ACTUALLY EVEN

01:02:30.279 --> 01:02:32.515
CONSIDER EXPANDING. THESE

01:02:32.582 --> 01:02:34.383
PROGRAMS BECAUSE THEY OPERATE

01:02:34.450 --> 01:02:35.585
REGIONALLY AND SO WHAT YOU COULD

01:02:35.651 --> 01:02:38.221
GET- IS THAT YOU CAN HAVE ONE

01:02:38.287 --> 01:02:39.355
FOR SOME PARTICIPANTS WORKING

01:02:39.422 --> 01:02:41.124
TOGETHER- POOLING THEIR

01:02:41.190 --> 01:02:42.992
RESOURCES AND MAKING USE OF THAT

01:02:43.059 --> 01:02:44.494
PARTICULAR SKILL SETS THAT EACH

01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:46.562
OF THEM HAVE. AND SO THE LOCAL

01:02:46.629 --> 01:02:47.964
LAW ENFORCEMENT WOULD ALSO HAVE

01:02:48.030 --> 01:02:49.499
INCENTIVE TO PARTICIPATE BECAUSE

01:02:49.565 --> 01:02:50.600
OF THOSE CRIMES BEING

01:02:50.666 --> 01:02:51.901
INVESTIGATED ARE DIRECTLY

01:02:51.968 --> 01:02:54.470
IMPACTING THE LOCAL COMMUNITY

01:02:54.537 --> 01:02:56.372
THE STATE ALSO BENEFITS BECAUSE

01:02:56.439 --> 01:02:57.507
THE STATE'S NOT BEARING THE FULL

01:02:57.573 --> 01:02:59.709
COST. OF KIND OF DEALING WITH

01:02:59.775 --> 01:03:01.177
THAT AND SO THOSE ARE JUST A

01:03:01.244 --> 01:03:05.248
COUPLE BLOCKS. AND WE'D BE HAPPY

01:03:05.314 --> 01:03:05.815

PLANNED AS A LOAN SH AND THIS

01:12:33.048 --> 01:12:34.516
WOULD BE SIMILAR TO THE TWENTY

01:12:34.583 --> 01:12:35.751
FIVE MILLION DOLLAR START AT ONE

01:12:35.818 --> 01:12:37.553

THE SECOND RECOMMENDATION- IS WE

01:12:55.137 --> 01:12:55.738

TRANSACTION FEE. THIS IS EXACTLY

01:13:01.243 --> 01:13:02.377
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE ONE

01:13:02.444 --> 01:13:04.113
THAT'S CURRENTLY ONE DOLLAR. PER

01:13:04.179 --> 01:13:06.582
TRANSACTION- THE INTENSIVE

01:13:06.648 --> 01:13:08.183
PROPOSITION SIXTY THREE AND

01:13:08.250 --> 01:13:09.818
ACTUALLY TWELVE THIRTY FIVE WAS

FOR FEE REVENUES TO COVER THE

01:13:11.286 --> 01:13:13.155
STATE'S REASONABLE REGULATORY

AND ENFORCEMENT COSTS. RELATED

01:13:15.124 --> 01:13:17.459
TO AMMUNITION PURCHASES AND SO-

01:13:17.526 --> 01:13:19.361
IF YOU LOOK AT THE FIGURE BEFORE

01:13:19.428 --> 01:13:22.030
YOU ON PAGE TWENTY SIX- A FEE

01:13:22.097 --> 01:13:23.098
INCREASE WILL BE NEEDED TO

01:13:23.165 --> 01:13:25.334
ADDRESS THE FINES- OPERATIONAL

01:13:25.400 --> 01:13:26.802
SHORTFALL WHICH HAS EXISTED

01:13:26.869 --> 01:13:29.138
SINCE THE FUND. HAS BEEN CREATED

01:13:29.204 --> 01:13:31.540
AS WELL AS TO START REPAYING

01:13:31.607 --> 01:13:33.342
THAT GENERAL PLAN START UP WELL.

01:13:33.408 --> 01:13:34.610
WE WOULDN'T KOW THAT IF THE

01:13:34.676 --> 01:13:37.112
INCREASE WOULD REQUIRE. A 55%

01:13:37.179 --> 01:13:38.480
APPROVAL BY EACH HOUSE OF THE

01:13:38.547 --> 01:13:40.149
LEGISLATURE AS WELL AS THE

01:13:40.215 --> 01:13:41.850
GOVERNOR'S SIGNATURE. WHEN

01:13:41.917 --> 01:13:43.786
THINKING ABOUT THAT FEE INCREASE

01:13:43.852 --> 01:13:45.621
THE LEGISLATURE HAS VARIOUS

01:13:45.687 --> 01:13:46.355
OPTIONS THAT THEY COULD

01:13:46.421 --> 01:13:48.824
CONSIDER. SUCH AS- AND- AS ARE

01:13:48.891 --> 01:13:50.092
THINKING ABOUT YOU KNOW VARIOUS

01:13:50.159 --> 01:13:52.361
FACTORS INCLUDING THE MAXIMUM

01:13:52.427 --> 01:13:54.663
PER TRANSACTION FEES DESIRED HOW

01:13:54.730 --> 01:13:56.498
QUICKLY THEY WANT THE GENERAL

01:13:56.565 --> 01:13:58.133
PLANS START AT ONCE TO BE

01:13:58.200 --> 01:13:59.168
REPAID. AND WHEN THE DESIRE TO

01:13:59.234 --> 01:14:00.402
SEE INCREASED SHOULD TAKE A

01:14:00.469 --> 01:14:03.272
FACT. SO FOR EXAMPLE- ASSUMING

01:14:03.338 --> 01:14:04.573
LITTLE CHANGING PURCHASER

01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:07.276
BEHAVIOR- INCREASING THE FEE BY

01:14:07.342 --> 01:14:08.877
TWO DOLLARS SO FOR A TOTAL THREE

01:14:08.944 --> 01:14:10.579
DOLLARS EACH THAT COULD

01:14:10.646 --> 01:14:12.447
BASICALLY HELP ENSURE THAT THE

01:14:12.514 --> 01:14:14.583
FUNDS OPERATIONAL SHORTFALL WAS

01:14:14.650 --> 01:14:16.018
ADDRESSED AND DEAL WITH KIND OF

01:14:16.084 --> 01:14:17.252
MINOR CHANGES IN REVENUES AND

01:14:17.319 --> 01:14:19.688
EXPENDITURES. AN ADDITIONAL ONE

01:14:19.755 --> 01:14:22.057
DOLLAR INCREASE FOR A TOTAL OF

01:14:22.124 --> 01:14:23.425
FOUR DOLLAR FEET THAT COULD

01:14:23.492 --> 01:14:24.893
ACTUALLY GENERATE SUFFICIENT

01:14:24.960 --> 01:14:26.562
REVENUES TO RETAIN THE GENERAL

01:14:26.628 --> 01:14:28.697
FUND LONG WITHIN THE NEXT

01:14:28.764 --> 01:14:34.803
FIFTEEN YEARS. SO THOSE ARE ALL

01:14:34.870 --> 01:14:36.238
THINGS THAT CAN BE WAIT. RELATED

01:14:36.305 --> 01:14:37.973
THE DNA I DON'T. FINDS WE HAVE

01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:38.640
THREE RECOMMENDATIONS RELATED TO

01:14:38.707 --> 01:14:40.042
THAT- WE WOULD NOTE FOR THE

01:14:40.108 --> 01:14:41.977
COMMITTEE THAT THIS IS ACTUALLY

01:14:42.044 --> 01:14:42.945
ONE OF THE STATE'S SPECIAL PLANS

01:14:43.011 --> 01:14:44.513
THAT IS IMPACTED BY DECLINING

01:14:44.580 --> 01:14:45.981
COLONEL FINANCE DEPARTMENT.

01:14:46.048 --> 01:14:46.782
WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT THIS

01:14:46.849 --> 01:14:48.383
COMMITTEE HAS TALKED ABOUT IN

01:14:48.450 --> 01:14:49.551
PRIOR EXPERIENCES WE JUST WANTED

01:14:49.618 --> 01:14:52.254
TO FIND. OUT SO FIRST WE WOULD

01:14:52.321 --> 01:14:53.455
RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE

01:14:53.522 --> 01:14:55.557
REQUIRE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO

01:14:55.624 --> 01:14:57.326
PORSCHE PARTIALLY SUPPORT THE

01:14:57.392 --> 01:14:59.027
BUREAU FORENSIC SERVICES.

01:14:59.094 --> 01:15:02.297
BEGINNING IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE

01:15:02.364 --> 01:15:02.965
TWENTY FOUR AM PROVIDE DOJ WITH

01:15:03.031 --> 01:15:04.900
DIRECTION ON HOW MUCH OF ITS

01:15:04.967 --> 01:15:07.102
OPERATIONS SHOULD COME FROM

01:15:07.169 --> 01:15:08.570
LOCAL AGENCIES SUCH AS LIKE ONE

01:15:08.637 --> 01:15:10.572
THIRD OR ONE HALF. AND THIS

01:15:10.639 --> 01:15:12.307
COULD REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF

01:15:12.374 --> 01:15:14.042
GENERAL FUND NEEDED TO SUPPORT

01:15:14.109 --> 01:15:15.043
THE BFS COST ON AN ONGOING

01:15:15.110 --> 01:15:17.246
BASIS. IN THE AGENDA BEFORE YOU

01:15:17.312 --> 01:15:19.648
ON PAGE TWENTY SEVEN YOU HAVE A

01:15:19.715 --> 01:15:20.816
GOOD CHART SHOWS BASICALLY THE

01:15:20.883 --> 01:15:22.184
GENERAL PLAN BACK FILL THAT HAS

01:15:22.251 --> 01:15:26.688
BEEN PROVIDED. IN RECENT YEARS.

01:15:26.755 --> 01:15:27.456
AND YOU CAN SEE THAT IT'S KIND

01:15:27.522 --> 01:15:28.957
OF INCREASING- WOULD ALSO THAT

01:15:29.024 --> 01:15:29.558
THIS RECOMMENDATION WOULD BE

01:15:29.625 --> 01:15:30.959
MORE EQUITABLE THAN THE EXISTING

01:15:31.026 --> 01:15:32.761
SYSTEM IN WHICH CERTAIN LOCAL

01:15:32.828 --> 01:15:33.929
GOVERNMENTS ARE RECEIVING

01:15:33.996 --> 01:15:36.098
SERVICES AT NO CHARGE WHILE

01:15:36.164 --> 01:15:37.733
OTHERS ARE PAYING TO OPERATE

01:15:37.799 --> 01:15:39.835
THEIR OWN LABORATORIES. AND SO

WITHOUT SUCH A FUND IN THE FIRST

01:19:43.445 --> 01:19:44.880
PLACE I DON'T KNOW THE GRAPHING

01:19:44.946 --> 01:19:47.249
HERE GOES BACK TO TWENTY SIXTEEN

01:19:47.315 --> 01:19:49.317
I DON'T REMEMBER WHEN IT WAS-

01:19:49.384 --> 01:19:51.019
ORIGINALLY LEGISLATED INTO

01:19:51.086 --> 01:19:53.822
EXISTENCE BUT- HAS THERE BEEN

01:19:53.889 --> 01:19:55.991
ANY SEPARATE AND APART FROM

INTENDED THE LEGISLATIVE INTENT

01:20:16.311 --> 01:20:17.846
WAS TO KEEP. THE WRONG PEOPLE

01:20:17.913 --> 01:20:19.314
FROM GETTING AMMUNITION IN THE

01:20:19.381 --> 01:20:22.617
FIRST PLACE BUT- IF IT MADE IT

01:20:22.684 --> 01:20:24.119
MAY MAKE SOME SENSE OF SOMETHING

01:20:24.186 --> 01:20:25.687
FOR US TO HAVE A FEEL FOR

01:20:25.754 --> 01:20:27.289

ESTIMATES WERE SIMPLY- BASED ON

01:20:56.685 --> 01:20:58.486
OUR ESTIMATES OF WHAT WE BELIEVE

01:20:58.553 --> 01:20:59.554
THAT THOSE TRANSACTIONS WOULD

01:20:59.621 --> 01:21:02.424
BE- NOW THAT THE PROGRAM HAS

01:21:02.490 --> 01:21:03.758

YEARS- WE'VE IDENTIFIED THAT THE

01:21:05.860 --> 01:21:07.128
COST OF THE PROGRAM

ANNUALLY- THE OPERATIONAL COSTS

01:21:14.369 --> 01:21:15.804

DOLLAR FEE REVENUES THAT ARE

01:21:16.972 --> 01:21:19.107
COMING IN- AND A NEED FOR

ADDITIONAL REVENUE EXISTS TO

IN LIGHT PLAN WE FIND THIS TO BE

01:29:15.983 --> 01:29:17.652
NECESSARY FOR SEVERAL DIFFERENT

01:29:17.719 --> 01:29:19.520
REASONS TO BEGIN WITH THE NUMBER

01:29:19.587 --> 01:29:21.122
AND SEVERITY OF EMERGENCY USE

01:29:25.093 --> 01:29:26.661
VARIOUS REASONS SUCH AS CLIMATE

01:29:26.728 --> 01:29:28.396
CHANGE TO THINK THAT THIS

01:29:28.463 --> 01:29:30.264
INCREASED LEVEL OF EMERGENCIES

01:29:30.331 --> 01:29:32.100

01:29:37.472 --> 01:29:38.106
SIGNIFICANTLY AUGMENTED THE

01:29:59.360 --> 01:30:01.863
INCREASE ON WHAT WE FIND THAT

01:30:01.929 --> 01:30:03.297
IT'S REASONABLE FOR THE GOVERNOR

01:30:03.364 --> 01:30:04.766
TO PROPOSE TO INCREASE THE

01:30:04.832 --> 01:30:05.833

AMOUNT OF EFFORT TO GET THE

01:37:15.296 --> 01:37:16.997

COURSE WE CAN NEVER INSURE FOR-

01:37:39.787 --> 01:37:42.223
OPERATIONAL CONTINUITY AND

01:37:42.289 --> 01:37:43.123
EXPERTISE TO BE DEVELOPED

TODAY AND WHAT WE PROJECT INTO

01:38:31.105 --> 01:38:33.574
THE FUTURE. ALL WILL BE HANDED

01:38:33.641 --> 01:38:35.142

DAYS AND- AND WE'VE BEEN DEALING

01:38:46.720 --> 01:38:49.657
WITH- WELL SINCE TWO THOUSAND

01:38:49.723 --> 01:38:53.427

NOT TO MENTION EARTHQUAKES AND-

01:39:02.569 --> 01:39:03.871
FLOODING IN OTHER KINDS OF

01:39:03.937 --> 01:39:05.572
EVENTS WE HAD AND ALL OF THAT IS

01:39:05.639 --> 01:39:07.875
TAKEN A LOT OF THAT EFFORT TO

01:39:07.941 --> 01:39:08.809
GET THESE THESE COMMUNITIES

01:39:08.876 --> 01:39:11.645
RECOVERED- AND- AND BACK UP ON

01:39:11.712 --> 01:39:13.681

PRIOR TO THE SHAKING REACHING-

01:53:28.535 --> 01:53:30.904
THE TRAIN TRACKS AND DERAILING A

01:53:30.970 --> 01:53:33.206
TRAIN FOR EXAMPLE SO WORK THIS

01:53:33.273 --> 01:53:35.141
IS THIS CONSTANT OUR RESEARCH

01:53:35.208 --> 01:53:37.577
EFFORT TO MAKE SURE WE ARE ON

01:53:37.644 --> 01:53:39.045
THE CUTTING EDGE. WILL BE

01:53:39.112 --> 01:53:41.314
IMPORTANT SO THIS OUT PROPOSAL

01:53:41.381 --> 01:53:48.288
IS- A PROPOSAL TO- CONTINUE TO-

01:53:48.354 --> 01:53:53.693
TO AMPLIFY THE THIS THE. SYSTEM

01:53:53.760 --> 01:53:54.460
AND PUT IT IN PLACE. THANK YOU

OF PRESENTATION BUT AVAILABLE TO

01:54:01.401 --> 01:54:04.437
HELP ANSWER QUESTIONS THANK YOU-

01:54:04.504 --> 01:54:07.140
AND LA- PLEASE. SIMILAR TO THE

01:54:07.207 --> 01:54:09.409
PROPOSALS- WE DISCUSSED EARLIER

01:54:09.475 --> 01:54:10.743
WE'RE RECOMMENDING THAT THIS

01:54:10.810 --> 01:54:12.512
APPROACH PROPOSAL BE APPROVED ON

01:54:12.579 --> 01:54:14.214
A THREE YEAR LIMITED TERM BASIS

01:54:14.280 --> 01:54:16.249
AND BE RECONSIDERED AFTER THE

01:54:16.316 --> 01:54:18.384
COMPLETION OF THE STRATEGIC

01:54:18.451 --> 01:54:20.153
PLANNER BASELINE BUDGET REVIEW I

01:54:20.220 --> 01:54:22.021
MENTIONED EARLIER- WELL THE

01:54:22.088 --> 01:54:23.890
SYSTEM IS POTENTIALLY PROMISING

01:54:23.957 --> 01:54:25.558
WITHOUT A STRATEGIC PLAN IT'S

01:54:25.625 --> 01:54:27.093
UNCLEAR WHETHER THE CURRENT

01:54:27.160 --> 01:54:28.228
APPROACH TO BUILDING OUT THE

01:54:28.294 --> 01:54:29.762
SYSTEM ALIGNS WITH THE STATE'S

01:54:29.829 --> 01:54:32.765
OVERALL RESPONSE CAPACITY GOALS.

01:54:32.832 --> 01:54:33.933
SO FOR EXAMPLE IT'S UNCLEAR

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:35.201
WHETHER THE CURRENT EFFORTS TO

01:54:35.268 --> 01:54:36.469
EXPAND THE SYSTEM WOULD PROVIDE

01:54:36.536 --> 01:54:38.238
THE HIGHEST PRIORITY BENEFITS OR

01:54:38.304 --> 01:54:39.639
WHETHER ALTERNATIVE STRATEGIES

01:54:39.706 --> 01:54:41.341
SUCH AS INCREASED FUNDING FOR

01:54:41.407 --> 01:54:42.875
BUILDING SEISMIC RETROFITS WOULD

01:54:42.942 --> 01:54:46.846
BETTER INDICATE. THE POTENTIAL

OF THE IN AUGMENTATION. THAT

02:12:28.874 --> 02:12:29.841
SOME CASES CAN BE VERY

02:12:29.908 --> 02:12:30.942

LIMITED TO A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE

02:12:37.683 --> 02:12:38.784
BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF
