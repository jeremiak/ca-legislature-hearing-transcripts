00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:12.597 region:rollup2
IN THE STATE AND BEYOND.

00:32:10.829 --> 00:32:14.599 region:rollup2
WE ARE WORKING WITH OUR PARTNERS

00:32:12.597 --> 00:32:16.401 region:rollup2
IN THE DAM SAFETY INDUSTRY AS

00:32:14.599 --> 00:32:18.370 region:rollup2
WELL AS WITH ACADEMIA.

00:32:16.401 --> 00:32:20.672 region:rollup2
THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND OUTSIDE

00:32:18.370 --> 00:32:23.074 region:rollup2
EXPERTS TO IDENTIFY STRONGER

00:32:20.672 --> 00:32:26.411 region:rollup2
SCIENCE BASED STRATEGIES AND

00:32:23.074 --> 00:32:29.247 region:rollup2
METHODS TO EVALUATE OPERATE AND

00:32:26.411 --> 00:32:31.483 region:rollup2
MAINTAIN PARDEE HOMES.

00:32:29.247 --> 00:32:32.851 region:rollup2
THE REPORT IDENTIFIES ISSUES

00:32:31.483 --> 00:32:34.119 region:rollup2
WITH THE ORIGINAL DESIGN AND

00:32:32.851 --> 00:32:35.954 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTION OF THE MAIN

00:32:34.119 --> 00:32:37.389 region:rollup2
SPILLWAY. AND HIGHLIGHTS THE

00:32:35.954 --> 00:32:39.891 region:rollup2
NEED FOR MORE IN DEPTH

00:32:37.389 --> 00:32:42.127 region:rollup2
EVALUATIONS OF ALL ASSOCIATED

00:32:39.891 --> 00:32:44.396 region:rollup2
STRUCTURES OF A DIEM FACILITY

00:32:42.127 --> 00:32:45.997 region:rollup2
NOT JUST THE DAM ITSELF.

00:32:44.396 --> 00:32:47.799 region:rollup2
ADDITIONALLY IT SHOWS THE NEED

00:32:45.997 --> 00:32:50.735 region:rollup2
TO DIG DEEPER INTO THE ORIGINAL

00:32:47.799 --> 00:32:53.138 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTION AND GEOLOGICAL DATA

00:32:50.735 --> 00:32:55.106 region:rollup2
IN FUTURE REVIEWS OF DAMS AND

00:32:53.138 --> 00:32:57.008 region:rollup2
THEIR ASSOCIATED STRUCTURES.

00:32:55.106 --> 00:32:58.276 region:rollup2
FOR THESE REASONS THE DIVISION

00:32:57.008 --> 00:32:59.511 region:rollup2
OF SAFETY OF DATA HOMES HAS

00:32:58.276 --> 00:33:02.414 region:rollup2
ALREADY BEGUN THESE RE

00:32:59.511 --> 00:33:04.049 region:rollup2
EVALUATIONS OF SPILLWAYS THAT

00:33:02.414 --> 00:33:05.784 region:rollup2
ARE SIMILAR TO OR OF BILLS IN

00:33:04.049 --> 00:33:07.319 region:rollup2
THEIR AGE THEIR SIZE AND THEIR

00:33:05.784 --> 00:33:10.755 region:rollup2
DESIGN. AND WE'LL TALK A BIT

00:33:07.319 --> 00:33:12.524 region:rollup2
MORE ABOUT THAT LATER.

00:33:10.755 --> 00:33:13.391 region:rollup2
WITH THE HELP OF OUR CONTRACTOR.

00:33:12.524 --> 00:33:13.825 region:rollup2
AND THE OVERSIGHT FROM AN

00:33:13.391 --> 00:33:15.727 region:rollup2
INDEPENDENT BOARD OF

00:33:13.825 --> 00:33:18.096 region:rollup2
CONSULTANTS.

00:33:15.727 --> 00:33:21.032 region:rollup2
STATE AND FEDERAL REGULATORS

00:33:18.096 --> 00:33:22.801 region:rollup2
GW R. HAS SUCCESSFULLY REBUILT

00:33:21.032 --> 00:33:24.669 region:rollup2
THE MAIN SPILLWAY. I'M AS OF

00:33:22.801 --> 00:33:26.705 region:rollup2
NOVEMBER FIRST BRINGING IT TO

00:33:24.669 --> 00:33:27.873 region:rollup2
TODAY'S STANDARDS.

00:33:26.705 --> 00:33:30.675 region:rollup2
AND IN DESIGNING AND

00:33:27.873 --> 00:33:33.144 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTING THE MAIN SPILLWAY.

00:33:30.675 --> 00:33:35.514 region:rollup2
GWR TOOK INTO CONSIDERATION THE

00:33:33.144 --> 00:33:37.582 region:rollup2
TWENTY FOUR POTENTIAL FAILURE

00:33:35.514 --> 00:33:38.850 region:rollup2
MECHANISMS THAT WERE IDENTIFIED

00:33:37.582 --> 00:33:41.086 region:rollup2
BY THE INDEPENDENT FRIENDS

00:33:38.850 --> 00:33:43.421 region:rollup2
SIXTEEN BACK IN THERE MEMO FROM

00:33:41.086 --> 00:33:44.456 region:rollup2
OF THE MAY TIMEFRAME.

00:33:43.421 --> 00:33:46.958 region:rollup2
WE HAVE TAKEN THOSE INTO

00:33:44.456 --> 00:33:50.362 region:rollup2
CONSIDERATION. WE'VE INCLUDED.

00:33:46.958 --> 00:33:52.030 region:rollup2
MANY MODERN STANDARDS AND

00:33:50.362 --> 00:33:53.665 region:rollup2
ADDRESSED ISSUES IN THE.

00:33:52.030 --> 00:33:56.935 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTION OF THE REPAIRS OF

00:33:53.665 --> 00:33:57.369 region:rollup2
THE MAIN SPILLWAY.

00:33:56.935 --> 00:33:59.037 region:rollup2
THESE.

00:33:57.369 --> 00:34:00.772 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL CAUSES ARE ALSO A

00:33:59.037 --> 00:34:04.576 region:rollup2
FOCUS OF THE DIVISION OF SAFETY

00:34:00.772 --> 00:34:06.278 region:rollup2
OF DAMS SPILLWAY RE EVALUATIONS.

00:34:04.576 --> 00:34:08.980 region:rollup2
AND WITH THAT I'M GONNA SWITCH

00:34:06.278 --> 00:34:10.649 region:rollup2
GEARS AND MOVE INTO THE POWER

00:34:08.980 --> 00:34:12.617 region:rollup2
POINT PRESENTATION ALBUM.

00:34:10.649 --> 00:34:14.219 region:rollup2
TRY TO KEEP US GOING ON WHICH

00:34:12.617 --> 00:34:16.922 region:rollup2
NUMBER SLIGHT MONSTER.

00:34:14.219 --> 00:34:18.356 region:rollup2
OKAY EVERYONE HAS THAT SUNROOM

00:34:16.922 --> 00:34:19.324 region:rollup2
IN BEHIND ME AND I'M ITS PROBLY

00:34:18.356 --> 00:34:20.859 region:rollup2
NOT VISIBLE BECAUSE IT'S

00:34:19.324 --> 00:34:23.328 region:rollup2
DIRECTLY BEHIND ME BUT WE HAVE

00:34:20.859 --> 00:34:24.462 region:rollup2
SOME BLOWN UP FIGURES JUST A FEW

00:34:23.328 --> 00:34:26.164 region:rollup2
OF THE IMAGES THAT ARE IN YOUR

00:34:24.462 --> 00:34:28.333 region:rollup2
POWER POINT. AND WE MAY REAP

00:34:26.164 --> 00:34:30.135 region:rollup2
REFERENCE THOSE IT DOWN AGAIN AS

00:34:28.333 --> 00:34:31.736 region:rollup2
WE GO THROUGH THE PRESENTATION.

00:34:30.135 --> 00:34:33.905 region:rollup2
OKAY SO MANY JUMPED TO SLIDE

00:34:31.736 --> 00:34:35.573 region:rollup2
NUMBER TWO WHICH IS AN OVERVIEW

00:34:33.905 --> 00:34:37.642 region:rollup2
OF THE LAKE OROVILLE SPILLWAYS

00:34:35.573 --> 00:34:38.777 region:rollup2
INCIDENT AREA. AND THIS IS JUST

00:34:37.642 --> 00:34:40.412 region:rollup2
QUICKLY TO REORIENT EVERYONE TO

00:34:38.777 --> 00:34:41.513 region:rollup2
WHAT.

00:34:40.412 --> 00:34:43.448 region:rollup2
THE STRUCTURES LOOK LIKE IN THE

00:34:41.513 --> 00:34:43.982 region:rollup2
ORIENTATION UP THERE SO VERY

00:34:43.448 --> 00:34:44.916 region:rollup2
QUICKLY IF YOU LOOK AT THE

00:34:43.982 --> 00:34:46.885 region:rollup2
IMAGE.

00:34:44.916 --> 00:34:48.987 region:rollup2
.

00:34:46.885 --> 00:34:50.922 region:rollup2
TO THE RIGHT OF OF THE PAGE IS

00:34:48.987 --> 00:34:52.857 region:rollup2
THE DAM ITSELF.

00:34:50.922 --> 00:34:54.426 region:rollup2
AND AT THE BASE OF THE DAM IS

00:34:52.857 --> 00:34:56.027 region:rollup2
THE HIGHEST POWER PLANT IN

00:34:54.426 --> 00:34:57.929 region:rollup2
CONCEDE THERE'S SMALL A GREAT

00:34:56.027 --> 00:34:59.965 region:rollup2
FIGURE. AND THERE'S ALSO THE

00:34:57.929 --> 00:35:00.865 region:rollup2
DIVERSION POOL WHICH.

00:34:59.965 --> 00:35:02.233 region:rollup2
COMES OUT OF THEM AT THE BOTTOM

00:35:00.865 --> 00:35:04.002 region:rollup2
OF THE DAM.

00:35:02.233 --> 00:35:05.470 region:rollup2
IF YOU MOVE OVER TO THE LEFT

00:35:04.002 --> 00:35:06.905 region:rollup2
SIDE OF THIS FIGURE I SHOULD

00:35:05.470 --> 00:35:08.340 region:rollup2
POINT OUT THERE'S THERE'S FIVE

00:35:06.905 --> 00:35:09.874 region:rollup2
STRUCTURES ARE MINUTE.

00:35:08.340 --> 00:35:12.510 region:rollup2
POINT TO THE DAM THE POWER

00:35:09.874 --> 00:35:15.413 region:rollup2
PLANTS THEDIVERSION PULL MOVING

00:35:12.510 --> 00:35:16.648 region:rollup2
OVER TO THE LEFT THE MAIN ITEM

00:35:15.413 --> 00:35:18.750 region:rollup2
OR GATED.

00:35:16.648 --> 00:35:19.851 region:rollup2
SPILLWAY WILL PROBABLY GO BACK

00:35:18.750 --> 00:35:20.986 region:rollup2
AND FORTH WITH TERMINOLOGY ON

00:35:19.851 --> 00:35:22.320 region:rollup2
THOSE TWO SAME THING MAIN

00:35:20.986 --> 00:35:23.321 region:rollup2
SPILLWAY.

00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:25.390 region:rollup2
I'M YOU CAN SEE THAT THE IMAGE

00:35:23.321 --> 00:35:27.359 region:rollup2
THERE AND HOW THE WATER SORT OF

00:35:25.390 --> 00:35:27.859 region:rollup2
FANS OUT BECAUSE THIS PHOTO WAS

00:35:27.359 --> 00:35:29.060 region:rollup2
TAKEN AFTER THE INCIDENT

00:35:27.859 --> 00:35:30.362 region:rollup2
OCCURRED.

00:35:29.060 --> 00:35:31.863 region:rollup2
AND THEN SHIPPED TO THE LEFT OF

00:35:30.362 --> 00:35:33.231 region:rollup2
THAT IS THE EMERGENCY SPILLWAY

00:35:31.863 --> 00:35:34.733 region:rollup2
WHICH IS KIND OF. THAT YOU CAN

00:35:33.231 --> 00:35:36.768 region:rollup2
SEE IT'S.

00:35:34.733 --> 00:35:38.036 region:rollup2
SORT OF THE RED SOIL BEAR AREA

00:35:36.768 --> 00:35:39.671 region:rollup2
THAT'S TO THE LA JUST TO THE

00:35:38.036 --> 00:35:42.207 region:rollup2
LEFT OF THE MAIN SPILLWAY. SO

00:35:39.671 --> 00:35:44.009 region:rollup2
THIS IS THE DAM IN ALL OF THE

00:35:42.207 --> 00:35:46.011 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATED STRUCTURES THAT ARE

00:35:44.009 --> 00:35:47.946 region:rollup2
THE SUBJECT OF THE HEARING IN

00:35:46.011 --> 00:35:51.683 region:rollup2
OUR INFORMATION TODAY.

00:35:47.946 --> 00:35:53.218 region:rollup2
SO MOVING IN TO THE NEXT SLIDE.

00:35:51.683 --> 00:35:54.753 region:rollup2
QUICKLY AGAIN WANTED TO REMIND

00:35:53.218 --> 00:35:56.554 region:rollup2
EVERYONE AND SET THE STAGE AGAIN

00:35:54.753 --> 00:35:58.690 region:rollup2
FOR THE WEATHER. THAT WE WERE

00:35:56.554 --> 00:36:01.159 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCING FEBRUARY JANUARY

00:35:58.690 --> 00:36:03.361 region:rollup2
AND FEBRUARY OF LAST YEAR. THIS

00:36:01.159 --> 00:36:06.064 region:rollup2
IMAGE SHOWS THE SERIES OF

00:36:03.361 --> 00:36:08.166 region:rollup2
ATMOSPHERIC REVERSE THAT HIT THE

00:36:06.064 --> 00:36:09.668 region:rollup2
WEST COAST OF NORTH AMERICA

00:36:08.166 --> 00:36:11.736 region:rollup2
BETWEEN JANUARY AND FEBRUARY.

00:36:09.668 --> 00:36:13.705 region:rollup2
AYE SHE THIS IS A LONGER STRETCH

00:36:11.736 --> 00:36:15.473 region:rollup2
I'M SORRY IF I CAN KEEP IT ONE

00:36:13.705 --> 00:36:17.275 region:rollup2
ONE SECOND IF YOU JUST GO BACK

00:36:15.473 --> 00:36:19.277 region:rollup2
FOR.

00:36:17.275 --> 00:36:20.211 region:rollup2
BUT AND AND TALK ABOUT THE

00:36:19.277 --> 00:36:21.980 region:rollup2
TRANSMISSION LINES I WAS

00:36:20.211 --> 00:36:25.083 region:rollup2
RELEASED REQUIRE THAT WHEN I WAS

00:36:21.980 --> 00:36:25.684 region:rollup2
OUT. A ON THE OPEN AND LOOKING

00:36:25.083 --> 00:36:27.318 region:rollup2
AT THE DAM.

00:36:25.684 --> 00:36:28.653 region:rollup2
JUST THE AMOUNT OF WORK THAT

00:36:27.318 --> 00:36:29.754 region:rollup2
HAD TO GO INTO A DON'T KNOW THAT

00:36:28.653 --> 00:36:31.890 region:rollup2
BUT PEOPLE I THOUGHT ABOUT ALL

00:36:29.754 --> 00:36:32.457 region:rollup2
THE TRANSMISSION LINES THAT WERE

00:36:31.890 --> 00:36:33.591 region:rollup2
OUT THERE THAT ALL HAD TO BE

00:36:32.457 --> 00:36:34.459 region:rollup2
MOVED.

THIS IMAGE BUT YES THOSE WERE

00:36:37.262 --> 00:36:39.898 region:rollup2
PART OF IN. WALL TALK ABOUT

00:36:39.230 --> 00:36:41.366 region:rollup2
THOSE WHEN WE GET INTO SORT OF

00:36:39.898 --> 00:36:42.267 region:rollup2
THE BALANCING OF THE RISK WHEN

00:36:41.366 --> 00:36:45.670 region:rollup2
THE INCIDENT OCCURRED IN AND

00:36:42.267 --> 00:36:48.540 region:rollup2
THAT WAS.

THE LEFT

00:36:56.381 --> 00:37:01.853 region:rollup2
OF THE A SPILLWAY WAS A GREAT

00:36:58.650 --> 00:37:03.288 region:rollup2
CONCERN AND THAT TOWER. WORKS

00:37:01.853 --> 00:37:04.055 region:rollup2
BACKWARDS TOWARDS.

00:37:03.288 --> 00:37:04.823 region:rollup2
TO.

00:37:04.055 --> 00:37:06.157 region:rollup2
DISC.

00:37:04.823 --> 00:37:09.327 region:rollup2
POWER THE TRANSMISSION LINE FOR

00:37:06.157 --> 00:37:11.329 region:rollup2
P. G. ANY SO THAT LINE IF WE HAD

00:37:09.327 --> 00:37:13.832 region:rollup2
LOST IT AT THE TIME WOULD HAVE

00:37:11.329 --> 00:37:15.700 region:rollup2
LOST POWER TO THE RADIO GATES.

00:37:13.832 --> 00:37:17.268 region:rollup2
THAT WERE ALLOWING US TO TO

00:37:15.700 --> 00:37:19.437 region:rollup2
RELEASE WATER AND IT WOULD HAVE.

00:37:17.268 --> 00:37:21.039 region:rollup2
TAKEN OUT THE POWER FOR THE

00:37:19.437 --> 00:37:23.274 region:rollup2
POWER PLANT WHICH WOULD HAVE

00:37:21.039 --> 00:37:25.443 region:rollup2
TAKEN AS MONTHS TO REBUILD THAT

00:37:23.274 --> 00:37:26.711 region:rollup2
POWER LINE SO TO TO ACTIONS WERE

00:37:25.443 --> 00:37:28.613 region:rollup2
TAKING AT THE TIME DURING THE

00:37:26.711 --> 00:37:30.515 region:rollup2
IMMERSING ONE IS TO RELOCATE THE

00:37:28.613 --> 00:37:33.218 region:rollup2
POWER LINES UP ABOVE. THE.

00:37:30.515 --> 00:37:33.785 region:rollup2
THE RADIO GAVE STRUCTURE SO

00:37:33.218 --> 00:37:34.886 region:rollup2
THAT IT'S OUT OF THE WAY AND

00:37:33.785 --> 00:37:37.055 region:rollup2
THEN.

00:37:34.886 --> 00:37:38.356 region:rollup2
ULTIMATELY REROUTED COMPLETELY

00:37:37.055 --> 00:37:40.058 region:rollup2
AWAY FROM THE SPILLWAY SO THAT

00:37:38.356 --> 00:37:43.862 region:rollup2
IT WOULD NO LONGER BE A THREAT

00:37:40.058 --> 00:37:45.497 region:rollup2
NOW AND INTO THE FUTURE.

00:37:43.862 --> 00:37:46.397 region:rollup2
THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

00:37:45.497 --> 00:37:48.099 region:rollup2
OKAY SO.

00:37:46.397 --> 00:37:50.468 region:rollup2
QUICKLY ON THE NEXT SLIDE

00:37:48.099 --> 00:37:52.437 region:rollup2
WANTED TO AGAIN POINT OUT THE

00:37:50.468 --> 00:37:55.106 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF ATMOSPHERIC REVERSED

00:37:52.437 --> 00:37:56.608 region:rollup2
THAT HIT OF THE WEST COAST LAST

00:37:55.106 --> 00:37:58.042 region:rollup2
WINTER. AND ESPECIALLY IN

00:37:56.608 --> 00:38:01.746 region:rollup2
JANUARY AND FEBRUARY WE

00:37:58.042 --> 00:38:03.481 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCED THE WETTEST ABOUT.

00:38:01.746 --> 00:38:05.617 region:rollup2
TWO MONTHS ON IN A. HUNDRED AND

00:38:03.481 --> 00:38:06.751 region:rollup2
TEN YEARS OF RECORD KEEPING FOR

00:38:05.617 --> 00:38:06.918 region:rollup2
THE FEATHER RIVER BASIN.

00:38:06.751 --> 00:38:09.087 region:rollup2
SO.

00:38:06.918 --> 00:38:12.056 region:rollup2
.

00:38:09.087 --> 00:38:14.626 region:rollup2
AS. WE WERE BALANCING INFLOWS

00:38:12.056 --> 00:38:15.727 region:rollup2
AND RAINFALL AND STORM EVENTS IN

00:38:14.626 --> 00:38:17.562 region:rollup2
THE MIDST OF ALL THIS AND YOU

00:38:15.727 --> 00:38:19.130 region:rollup2
WILL SEE ON THE NEXT SLIDE. WE

00:38:17.562 --> 00:38:21.466 region:rollup2
HAD THE INCIDENT OCCUR AT THE

00:38:19.130 --> 00:38:22.800 region:rollup2
MAIN SPILLWAY.

00:38:21.466 --> 00:38:25.270 region:rollup2
AND ONE THING ABOUT BEEF I WILL

00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:26.604 region:rollup2
JUST MENTION IN TERMS OF INFLOW.

00:38:25.270 --> 00:38:27.972 region:rollup2
RIGHT AT THE POINT OF THE TIME

00:38:26.604 --> 00:38:30.041 region:rollup2
OF INCIDENTS AROUND THE SIXTH OR

00:38:27.972 --> 00:38:31.376 region:rollup2
SEVENTH OF FEBRUARY. THE STORM

00:38:30.041 --> 00:38:32.944 region:rollup2
THAT WE EXPERIENCED DURING THAT

00:38:31.376 --> 00:38:34.913 region:rollup2
TIME FRAME EXCEEDED THE

00:38:32.944 --> 00:38:36.314 region:rollup2
FORECASTED AMOUNT IN THIS WAS

00:38:34.913 --> 00:38:38.249 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT WE EXPERIENCE

00:38:36.314 --> 00:38:39.818 region:rollup2
SEVERAL TIMES LAST WINTER. AND

00:38:38.249 --> 00:38:41.486 region:rollup2
IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE IT BE

00:38:39.818 --> 00:38:43.254 region:rollup2
AMOUNT WAS SUCCEEDED BY ABOUT

00:38:41.486 --> 00:38:44.222 region:rollup2
FIFTY THOUSAND CUBIC FEET PER

00:38:43.254 --> 00:38:45.924 region:rollup2
SECOND OVER THE.

00:38:44.222 --> 00:38:47.859 region:rollup2
AS THE MAIN SPILLWAY BEGAN TO A

00:38:45.924 --> 00:38:49.427 region:rollup2
ROAD SAYS WE'RE HAVING THE ISSUE

00:38:47.859 --> 00:38:52.330 region:rollup2
WE ARE ALSO HAVING A STORM THAT

00:38:49.427 --> 00:38:54.065 region:rollup2
WAS MUCH LARGER THAN WE HAD BEEN

00:38:52.330 --> 00:38:57.569 region:rollup2
ABLE TO PREDICT THE FORECASTING.

00:38:54.065 --> 00:38:58.236 region:rollup2
SO THIS NEXT SLIDE SHOWS THE.

00:38:57.569 --> 00:39:00.672 region:rollup2
THE INCIDENT.

00:38:58.236 --> 00:39:02.307 region:rollup2
AS IT BEGAN ON THE SEVENTH.

00:39:00.672 --> 00:39:04.442 region:rollup2
THIS WAS A POINT THAT DID OF

00:39:02.307 --> 00:39:05.910 region:rollup2
YOUR STOPPED FLOWS ON THE MAIN

00:39:04.442 --> 00:39:08.346 region:rollup2
SPILLWAY DURING THE SEVENTH TO

00:39:05.910 --> 00:39:10.748 region:rollup2
ASSESS THE INITIAL DAMAGE. YOU

00:39:08.346 --> 00:39:13.384 region:rollup2
CAN SEE BY THE PHOTO ON THE LEFT

00:39:10.748 --> 00:39:15.353 region:rollup2
HAND SIDE OF OF YOUR PAPER THAT

00:39:13.384 --> 00:39:16.688 region:rollup2
ANNA WE PUT SOME STATS IN THERE

00:39:15.353 --> 00:39:17.755 region:rollup2
THAT THE DAMAGE INITIALLY WAS

00:39:16.688 --> 00:39:18.957 region:rollup2
ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY FEET

00:39:17.755 --> 00:39:20.391 region:rollup2
WIDE.

00:39:18.957 --> 00:39:22.393 region:rollup2
FORTY FEET LONG AND THIRTY TO

00:39:20.391 --> 00:39:24.462 region:rollup2
FORTY FEET DEEP.

00:39:22.393 --> 00:39:25.663 region:rollup2
THE WHOLE THAT HAD BEEN CREATED.

00:39:24.462 --> 00:39:27.532 region:rollup2
BUT I AND I ALSO WANT TO POINT

00:39:25.663 --> 00:39:29.400 region:rollup2
OUT EVEN AS WE WERE STOPPING

00:39:27.532 --> 00:39:32.303 region:rollup2
FLOWS WE ARE EVALUATING THIS

00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:33.605 region:rollup2
INITIAL DAMAGE WE HAD D. W. ARE

00:39:32.303 --> 00:39:35.840 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES IN CREWS THAT WERE

00:39:33.605 --> 00:39:36.908 region:rollup2
BEGINNING PLANNING FOR RECOVERY

00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:38.409 region:rollup2
AND REPAIRS IN THE IMMEDIATE

00:39:36.908 --> 00:39:38.977 region:rollup2
TIME.

00:39:38.409 --> 00:39:41.212 region:rollup2
AND.

00:39:38.977 --> 00:39:42.614 region:rollup2
ALSO BEGINNING TO THINK LONGER

00:39:41.212 --> 00:39:45.350 region:rollup2
TERM THROUGH THE WINTER SEASON

00:39:42.614 --> 00:39:46.217 region:rollup2
THE SPRING AND BEYOND.

00:39:45.350 --> 00:39:50.421 region:rollup2
SO.

00:39:46.217 --> 00:39:52.257 region:rollup2
MOVING TO THE NEXT SLIDE HOME.

00:39:50.421 --> 00:39:53.391 region:rollup2
WHAT'S GOING ON RIGHT SIDE HERE.

00:39:52.257 --> 00:39:55.059 region:rollup2
OH I'M SORRY I'M NOT BUT THAT'S

00:39:53.391 --> 00:39:55.627 region:rollup2
OKAY WE CAN JUST GO THERE AND

00:39:55.059 --> 00:39:56.794 region:rollup2
ALL KEEP TALKING FOR AWHILE

00:39:55.627 --> 00:39:58.096 region:rollup2
HERE.

00:39:56.794 --> 00:40:00.298 region:rollup2
THIS IS WHERE I WANTED TO POINT

00:39:58.096 --> 00:40:01.933 region:rollup2
OUT AND THE FOUR MAIN RISKS THAT

00:40:00.298 --> 00:40:03.968 region:rollup2
THE DEPARTMENT HAD TO BALANCE

00:40:01.933 --> 00:40:04.869 region:rollup2
DURING THOSE HOURS AFTER BETWEEN

00:40:03.968 --> 00:40:06.671 region:rollup2
FEBRUARY SEVENTH. AND THE

00:40:04.869 --> 00:40:08.172 region:rollup2
TWELFTH.

00:40:06.671 --> 00:40:11.009 region:rollup2
AS A WATER CONTINUED TO FLOW

00:40:08.172 --> 00:40:11.509 region:rollup2
DOWN THE DAMAGED MEAN SPILLWAY

00:40:11.009 --> 00:40:12.410 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE HAD TO MANAGE

00:40:11.509 --> 00:40:14.312 region:rollup2
INFLOWS.

00:40:12.410 --> 00:40:15.980 region:rollup2
EROSION IN THE FAILURE OF THE

00:40:14.312 --> 00:40:17.282 region:rollup2
SHOOT ITSELF CONTINUED AT AN

00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:18.650 region:rollup2
ALARMING RATE EROSION WAS MOVING

00:40:17.282 --> 00:40:21.886 region:rollup2
UP.

00:40:18.650 --> 00:40:23.588 region:rollup2
UPWARDS UPHILL FASTER THAN WE

00:40:21.886 --> 00:40:25.356 region:rollup2
HAD ANTICIPATED INITIALLY.

00:40:23.588 --> 00:40:26.891 region:rollup2
THE HIGHEST RISK THAT WAS FACING

00:40:25.356 --> 00:40:28.393 region:rollup2
THE DEPARTMENT WAS THE CONTINUED

00:40:26.891 --> 00:40:29.727 region:rollup2
EROSION OF THE MAIN SPILLWAY

00:40:28.393 --> 00:40:31.596 region:rollup2
TOWARDS THOSE GATES.

00:40:29.727 --> 00:40:32.897 region:rollup2
THAT WE BELIEVE.

00:40:31.596 --> 00:40:35.099 region:rollup2
HOW IT MADE ITS WAY TO THE GATES

00:40:32.897 --> 00:40:36.768 region:rollup2
WOULD HAVE MEANT CATASTROPHIC AN

00:40:35.099 --> 00:40:37.969 region:rollup2
UNCONTROLLED RELEASES OF WATER?

00:40:36.768 --> 00:40:39.270 region:rollup2
SO THAT WAS OUR ONE OF OUR

00:40:37.969 --> 00:40:41.072 region:rollup2
NUMBER ONE CONCERN WAS HOW DO WE

00:40:39.270 --> 00:40:43.775 region:rollup2
ADDRESS THAT.

00:40:41.072 --> 00:40:45.543 region:rollup2
ADDITIONALLY WE HAD VAST AMOUNTS

00:40:43.775 --> 00:40:47.345 region:rollup2
OF CONCRETE AND DEBRIS THAT HAD.

00:40:45.543 --> 00:40:48.146 region:rollup2
BEEN PUSHED DOWN.

00:40:47.345 --> 00:40:49.480 region:rollup2
THIS BILL WAY AND WERE BEING

00:40:48.146 --> 00:40:50.581 region:rollup2
COLLECTED IN THE DIVERSION

00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:52.517 region:rollup2
POLITIC POINTED OUT

00:40:50.581 --> 00:40:53.718 region:rollup2
THE BOTTOM OF THE DAM.

00:40:52.517 --> 00:40:55.687 region:rollup2
AND THAT WAS BEGINNING TO CAUSE

00:40:53.718 --> 00:40:57.956 region:rollup2
A BACKUP OF WATER TOWARDS THE

00:40:55.687 --> 00:40:59.324 region:rollup2
HYATT POWER PLANT IN INCREASING

00:40:57.956 --> 00:41:01.726 region:rollup2
THE LIKELIHOOD OF FLOODING IN

00:40:59.324 --> 00:41:02.627 region:rollup2
THAT CRITICAL STRUCTURE.

00:41:01.726 --> 00:41:03.594 region:rollup2
SO WITH A BROKEN MAIN SPILLWAY

00:41:02.627 --> 00:41:05.630 region:rollup2
THE POWER PLANTS

00:41:03.594 --> 00:41:07.432 region:rollup2
AS WE.

00:41:05.630 --> 00:41:09.167 region:rollup2
SOUGHT AND CONTINUE TO SEE IT

00:41:07.432 --> 00:41:11.636 region:rollup2
BECAME INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT AS

00:41:09.167 --> 00:41:13.871 region:rollup2
THE ONLY OTHER WAY TO MANAGE.

00:41:11.636 --> 00:41:14.839 region:rollup2
WATER RELEASES OUT OF THE REST

00:41:13.871 --> 00:41:16.808 region:rollup2
OF WAR AND TO HAVE CONTROLLED

00:41:14.839 --> 00:41:18.977 region:rollup2
RELEASES.

00:41:16.808 --> 00:41:21.412 region:rollup2
FOR THE REMAINDER OF WINTER AND

00:41:18.977 --> 00:41:23.247 region:rollup2
BEYOND INTO THE SPRING SESSION.

00:41:21.412 --> 00:41:25.149 region:rollup2
AT THE SAME TIME DWI ARE NEEDED

00:41:23.247 --> 00:41:26.918 region:rollup2
TO PROTECT THE POWER LINES HAS

00:41:25.149 --> 00:41:28.119 region:rollup2
TOLD JUST DESCRIBED HOME TO US

00:41:26.918 --> 00:41:30.188 region:rollup2
WHICH WERE INSTALLED ON THE

00:41:28.119 --> 00:41:31.689 region:rollup2
HILLSIDE THAT WAS PARALLEL TO

00:41:30.188 --> 00:41:33.558 region:rollup2
THE MAIN SPILLWAY. SAME HILLSIDE

00:41:31.689 --> 00:41:35.059 region:rollup2
THAT WAS ERODING. WITHOUT THESE

00:41:33.558 --> 00:41:36.627 region:rollup2
POWER LINES AS JOE POINTED OUT

00:41:35.059 --> 00:41:38.596 region:rollup2
D. W. R. WOULD HAVE TEMPORARILY

00:41:36.627 --> 00:41:39.831 region:rollup2
LOST ITS ABILITY TO OPERATE NOT

00:41:38.596 --> 00:41:41.332 region:rollup2
ONLY THE POWER PLANT BUT HE

00:41:39.831 --> 00:41:43.101 region:rollup2
MAIN GATES AT THE TOP OF THE

00:41:41.332 --> 00:41:44.602 region:rollup2
SPILLWAY.

00:41:43.101 --> 00:41:46.537 region:rollup2
AND THIS WOULD HAVE ON HIM

00:41:44.602 --> 00:41:47.939 region:rollup2
TEMPORARILY COULD HAVE BEEN JUST

00:41:46.537 --> 00:41:48.573 region:rollup2
A FEW DAYS BUT IN THE CASE OF

00:41:47.939 --> 00:41:50.508 region:rollup2
THE POWER PLANT MIGHT HAVE BEEN

00:41:48.573 --> 00:41:51.709 region:rollup2
MONTHS.

00:41:50.508 --> 00:41:53.678 region:rollup2
SO TO REDUCE THE RISK TO THE

00:41:51.709 --> 00:41:55.780 region:rollup2
MAIN SPILLWAY THE POWER LINES IN

00:41:53.678 --> 00:41:57.849 region:rollup2
THE POWER PLANT DWI ARE DECIDED

00:41:55.780 --> 00:42:00.418 region:rollup2
TO REDUCE RELEASES FROM THE MAIN

00:41:57.849 --> 00:42:02.186 region:rollup2
SPILLWAY. DWS MODELING SHOW THAT

00:42:00.418 --> 00:42:03.621 region:rollup2
AT THESE REDUCED RELEASES THE

00:42:02.186 --> 00:42:04.756 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT WOULD STILL BE ABLE

00:42:03.621 --> 00:42:06.357 region:rollup2
TO KEEP THE WEIGHT LAKE LEVEL AT

00:42:04.756 --> 00:42:08.092 region:rollup2
A SAFE.

00:42:06.357 --> 00:42:10.795 region:rollup2
LEVEL BELOW THE EMERGENCY

00:42:08.092 --> 00:42:13.064 region:rollup2
SPILLWAY CELL.

00:42:10.795 --> 00:42:14.699 region:rollup2
HOWEVER INFLOWS INCREASED AND AS

00:42:13.064 --> 00:42:16.968 region:rollup2
I MENTIONED BECAUSE OF THE STORM

00:42:14.699 --> 00:42:18.169 region:rollup2
EVENT THAT HAD COME IN AND HAD.

00:42:16.968 --> 00:42:19.570 region:rollup2
IT ACTUALLY HAS SEVERAL STORMS

00:42:18.169 --> 00:42:21.572 region:rollup2
ARE COMING ITS APART.

00:42:19.570 --> 00:42:23.174 region:rollup2
THEMSELVES OVER THE AREA AND THE

00:42:21.572 --> 00:42:26.677 region:rollup2
RINK CONTINUE TO COME TO THE

00:42:23.174 --> 00:42:28.613 region:rollup2
INFLOWS. CONTINUE TO INCREASE.

00:42:26.677 --> 00:42:30.982 region:rollup2
AND LASTED LONGER THAN WE HAD

00:42:28.613 --> 00:42:33.151 region:rollup2
ANTICIPATED HARM. AND.

00:42:30.982 --> 00:42:34.485 region:rollup2
AND LAKE LEVELS CONTINUE TO RISE

00:42:33.151 --> 00:42:36.721 region:rollup2
WHICH RESULTED IN THE ULTIMATE

00:42:34.485 --> 00:42:37.688 region:rollup2
USE OF THE EMERGENCY SPILLWAY ON

00:42:36.721 --> 00:42:40.124 region:rollup2
FEBRUARY STARTING ON FEBRUARY

00:42:37.688 --> 00:42:41.859 region:rollup2
ELEVENTH.

00:42:40.124 --> 00:42:42.627 region:rollup2
AND SO NOW THE SUSPECTS ARE THE

00:42:41.859 --> 00:42:43.928 region:rollup2
SLIGHT HAD YOU GUYS TURNED TO

00:42:42.627 --> 00:42:45.496 region:rollup2
WAS JUST AS AN IMAGE OF THE

00:42:43.928 --> 00:42:47.598 region:rollup2
EMERGENCY SPILLWAY AS EROSION

00:42:45.496 --> 00:42:49.967 region:rollup2
WAS OCCURRING. THIS PHOTO TAKEN

00:42:47.598 --> 00:42:52.737 region:rollup2
ON FEBRUARY TWELFTH.

00:42:49.967 --> 00:42:54.338 region:rollup2
SO. ON FEBRUARY TWELFTH AS WE

00:42:52.737 --> 00:42:56.274 region:rollup2
WATCHED THE HILLSIDE BELOW THE

00:42:54.338 --> 00:42:58.376 region:rollup2
EMERGENCY SPILLWAY BEGIN TO

00:42:56.274 --> 00:43:00.244 region:rollup2
ERODE AND AGAIN MORE QUICKLY AT

00:42:58.376 --> 00:43:02.447 region:rollup2
THAN WE HAD ANTICIPATED. THIS

00:43:00.244 --> 00:43:04.115 region:rollup2
WAS THE POINT IN TIME THAT IN

00:43:02.447 --> 00:43:06.084 region:rollup2
PROVIDING INFORMATION TO THE

00:43:04.115 --> 00:43:08.519 region:rollup2
BUTTE COUNTY SHERIFF HER SHARE

00:43:06.084 --> 00:43:10.621 region:rollup2
OF COREY HONI. IT WAS DECIDED

00:43:08.519 --> 00:43:11.722 region:rollup2
THAT IN EVACUATION NEEDED TO

00:43:10.621 --> 00:43:13.024 region:rollup2
OCCUR IN THE INTEREST OF PUBLIC

00:43:11.722 --> 00:43:13.825 region:rollup2
SAFETY SO THIS WAS ON THE

00:43:13.024 --> 00:43:16.727 region:rollup2
TWELFTH.

00:43:13.825 --> 00:43:17.795 region:rollup2
EAH.

00:43:16.727 --> 00:43:18.696 region:rollup2
SO JUST ADD A LITTLE MORE

00:43:17.795 --> 00:43:20.031 region:rollup2
INFORMATION AND I WAS PART OF

00:43:18.696 --> 00:43:21.399 region:rollup2
THE INCIDENT

00:43:20.031 --> 00:43:23.301 region:rollup2
COMMAND TEAM THAT WAS UP THERE

00:43:21.399 --> 00:43:24.802 region:rollup2
FROM THE SEVENTH AND ULTIMATELY

00:43:23.301 --> 00:43:26.971 region:rollup2
BECAME THE INCIDENT COMMANDER

00:43:24.802 --> 00:43:28.673 region:rollup2
SOON AFTER THE EVACUATION SO I

00:43:26.971 --> 00:43:30.441 region:rollup2
WAS THERE FROM THAT ALL THE WAY.

00:43:28.673 --> 00:43:32.410 region:rollup2
ALMOST TO THE END OF MARCH.

00:43:30.441 --> 00:43:33.478 region:rollup2
TO WE STABILIZED BUT I THINK

00:43:32.410 --> 00:43:35.379 region:rollup2
THOSE RISKS.

00:43:33.478 --> 00:43:37.381 region:rollup2
MANAGING THOSE RISKS MEANT THAT

00:43:35.379 --> 00:43:38.916 region:rollup2
WE DID HAVE A TEAM THAT WAS

00:43:37.381 --> 00:43:40.718 region:rollup2
PUTTING TOGETHER CONTINGENCIES

00:43:38.916 --> 00:43:42.120 region:rollup2
FOR ALL THOSE RISKS.

00:43:40.718 --> 00:43:44.122 region:rollup2
IN THE EVENT ANY OF THEM

00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:45.289 region:rollup2
HAPPENED SO WE WERE NOT ONLY

00:43:44.122 --> 00:43:46.924 region:rollup2
MANAGING THAT THEY WOULDN'T

00:43:45.289 --> 00:43:48.659 region:rollup2
HAPPEN REDUCE THE RISK BUT WE

00:43:46.924 --> 00:43:50.361 region:rollup2
WERE MANAGING RISK UP IF THAT

00:43:48.659 --> 00:43:52.296 region:rollup2
HAPPENED WILL OUR CONTINGENCY

00:43:50.361 --> 00:43:54.165 region:rollup2
PLANS. AND I THINK ON THE

00:43:52.296 --> 00:43:55.933 region:rollup2
EMERGENCY SPILLWAY. OUR INTENT

00:43:54.165 --> 00:43:58.035 region:rollup2
WAS NEVER TO USE IT.

00:43:55.933 --> 00:44:00.304 region:rollup2
BUT THAT WASN'T ENOUGH WE NEEDED

00:43:58.035 --> 00:44:02.540 region:rollup2
TO BE PREPARED IN CASE.

00:44:00.304 --> 00:44:03.941 region:rollup2
THINGS UNPREDICTABLE THINGS LIKE

00:44:02.540 --> 00:44:05.943 region:rollup2
THE WEATHER HAPPEN AND WE NEEDED

00:44:03.941 --> 00:44:07.912 region:rollup2
TO THAT'S WHY YOU SAW A

00:44:05.943 --> 00:44:08.546 region:rollup2
SCRUBBING THE HILLSIDE CLEARING

00:44:07.912 --> 00:44:09.313 region:rollup2
IT.

00:44:08.546 --> 00:44:11.716 region:rollup2
PUTTING.

00:44:09.313 --> 00:44:13.217 region:rollup2
SHOTCRETE OR CONCRETE ON THE

00:44:11.716 --> 00:44:15.720 region:rollup2
PRINTING THOSE WERE ALL

00:44:13.217 --> 00:44:17.088 region:rollup2
CONTINGENCY PLANNING EFFORTS.

00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:18.789 region:rollup2
IN THE EVENT IT HAPPENED EVEN

00:44:17.088 --> 00:44:19.657 region:rollup2
THOUGH IT WAS NOT AND WE WERE

00:44:18.789 --> 00:44:21.459 region:rollup2
HOPE WE WERE TRYING NOT TO LET

00:44:19.657 --> 00:44:23.494 region:rollup2
THAT

00:44:21.459 --> 00:44:25.062 region:rollup2
SO I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT.

00:44:23.494 --> 00:44:26.864 region:rollup2

AND NOT ONLY FOR THE IMMEDIATE

00:44:28.266 --> 00:44:33.037 region:rollup2
BUT. IN THE EVENT THINGS

HAPPENED.

00:44:33.037 --> 00:44:35.806 region:rollup2
THINKING JAW. SO I JUST WANT TO

00:44:34.572 --> 00:44:37.041 region:rollup2
END ON ON THIS PARTICULAR SLIDE

00:44:35.806 --> 00:44:39.110 region:rollup2

LOST.

00:44:41.245 --> 00:44:43.915 region:rollup2
AND THE DEPARTMENT RECOGNIZES

00:44:42.914 --> 00:44:45.049 region:rollup2

IN THAT THIS WAS A VERY

00:44:48.719 --> 00:44:51.956 region:rollup2
TERRIFYING EXPERIENCE FOR THEM.

00:44:50.254 --> 00:44:52.957 region:rollup2

SUMMARIZE.

00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:20.144 region:rollup2
EARLY ON WHAT THE KEY OBJECTIVES

pTOWARDS US LAST YEAR WE HAVE A

00:46:35.559 --> 00:46:39.563 region:rollup2
NOVEMBER HAD IN NOVEMBER ONE.

00:46:37.895 --> 00:46:41.866 region:rollup2
MILESTONE DATE TO GET THE MAIN

00:46:39.563 --> 00:46:44.669 region:rollup2
SPILLWAY TO A PLACE WHERE IT

00:46:41.866 --> 00:46:45.503 region:rollup2
COULD. TAKE FLOWS FROM THE.

00:46:44.669 --> 00:46:47.571 region:rollup2
FEATHER RIVER.

00:46:45.503 --> 00:46:49.707 region:rollup2
AT ABOUT A HUNDRED THOUSAND CFS

00:46:47.571 --> 00:46:52.009 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE WINTER SEASON WE MET

00:46:49.707 --> 00:46:54.045 region:rollup2
THAT MILESTONE. A THAT WAS

00:46:52.009 --> 00:46:54.412 region:rollup2
DEFINITELY R. NUMBER ONE ONE OF

00:46:54.045 --> 00:46:55.546 region:rollup2
OUR NUMBER ONE.

00:46:54.412 --> 00:46:56.847 region:rollup2
.

00:46:55.546 --> 00:46:58.015 region:rollup2
NICHOLS THROUGH THIS LAST YEAR

00:46:56.847 --> 00:47:00.051 region:rollup2
AND A VERY ACCELERATED RATE AND

00:46:58.015 --> 00:47:01.986 region:rollup2
TO ACHIEVE THAT.

00:47:00.051 --> 00:47:03.020 region:rollup2
THE SECOND GOAL WAS TO HOPE

00:47:01.986 --> 00:47:04.021 region:rollup2
SORRY THAT WAS THE SECOND GOING

00:47:03.020 --> 00:47:05.956 region:rollup2
MERGE THEM.

00:47:04.021 --> 00:47:07.291 region:rollup2
AND THE LAST ONE ON HERE'S

00:47:05.956 --> 00:47:08.592 region:rollup2
HAVING TO DO WITH THE EMERGENCY

00:47:07.291 --> 00:47:10.461 region:rollup2
SPILLWAY SO ALSO PART OF OUR

00:47:08.592 --> 00:47:12.797 region:rollup2
RECOVERY PLANNING OVER THE LAST

00:47:10.461 --> 00:47:17.201 region:rollup2
YEAR WAS TO BUILD A SEE CAN'T

00:47:12.797 --> 00:47:19.270 region:rollup2
CUT OFF WALL. IN TO THE BASE AT

00:47:17.201 --> 00:47:21.505 region:rollup2
DOWN THE SWORD DOWN HILL A BIT

00:47:19.270 --> 00:47:22.707 region:rollup2
FROM THE EMERGENCY SPILLWAY SILL

00:47:21.505 --> 00:47:25.376 region:rollup2
SO THAT.

00:47:22.707 --> 00:47:27.845 region:rollup2
SHOULD WE HAVE TO USE IT THAT IS

00:47:25.376 --> 00:47:29.080 region:rollup2
NOT THE INTENTION ON THE SEASON

00:47:27.845 --> 00:47:30.781 region:rollup2
BUT SHOULD THAT OCCUR THIS

00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:32.216 region:rollup2
CONCRETE WALL GOES DOWN INTO THE

00:47:30.781 --> 00:47:33.984 region:rollup2
FOUNDATION AND WOULD STOP

00:47:32.216 --> 00:47:35.586 region:rollup2
EROSION FROM COMING BACK UP THE

00:47:33.984 --> 00:47:36.987 region:rollup2
HILL SO ARE TO THOSE WORDS.

00:47:35.586 --> 00:47:38.956 region:rollup2
PRIMARY GOALS

00:47:36.987 --> 00:47:40.224 region:rollup2
AND THE NEXT SERIES OF PHOTOS

00:47:38.956 --> 00:47:42.093 region:rollup2
GIVE YOU A SENSEOF SOME OF THE

CONSTRUCTION THAT WENT ON OVER

00:47:42.093 --> 00:47:46.363 region:rollup2
THE YEAR SO THAT NEXT THREE

00:47:44.361 --> 00:47:49.233 region:rollup2
SLIDES IF YOU WILL. GIVE YOU A

00:47:46.363 --> 00:47:51.302 region:rollup2

MAIN SPILLWAYS AND WHAT THAT

00:47:56.273 --> 00:47:58.743 region:rollup2
LOOKS LIKE IN TERMS OF INCURRING

VERY EXTENSIVELY WITH THE ARMY

00:48:41.786 --> 00:48:45.456 region:rollup2
CORPS OF ENGINEERS AS WE'VE

00:48:43.454 --> 00:48:46.957 region:rollup2
MOVED THROUGH THIS PROCESS. AND

00:48:45.456 --> 00:48:48.359 region:rollup2
IN FACT THROUGH.

00:48:46.957 --> 00:48:50.294 region:rollup2
ALL OF THESE ENTITIES WE

00:48:48.359 --> 00:48:51.762 region:rollup2
RECEIVED SOMEWHERE AROUND EIGHT

00:48:50.294 --> 00:48:53.864 region:rollup2
HUNDRED AND SIXTY INDIVIDUAL

00:48:51.762 --> 00:49:01.038 region:rollup2
COMMENTS THAT ASSISTED US IN OUR

00:48:53.864 --> 00:49:02.807 region:rollup2
DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION PROCESS.

00:49:01.038 --> 00:49:04.875 region:rollup2
OKAY AND THEN I'M GONNA JUMP TO

00:49:02.807 --> 00:49:07.945 region:rollup2
DISLIKE HERE WHICH IS THE SORT

00:49:04.875 --> 00:49:09.814 region:rollup2
OF A SERIES OF. PHOTOGRAPHS THAT

00:49:07.945 --> 00:49:11.515 region:rollup2
GO FROM MAY THROUGH NOVEMBER

00:49:09.814 --> 00:49:13.517 region:rollup2
FIRST FIRST THAT SHOW THE

00:49:11.515 --> 00:49:15.553 region:rollup2
PROGRESS OF CONSTRUCTION.

00:49:13.517 --> 00:49:17.955 region:rollup2
AS I MENTIONED MAY AND NOVEMBER

00:49:15.553 --> 00:49:20.191 region:rollup2
FIRST WAS A MAJOR MILESTONE AND

00:49:17.955 --> 00:49:21.492 region:rollup2
WE ACHIEVE THE ABILITY TO PASS A

00:49:20.191 --> 00:49:23.093 region:rollup2
HUNDRED THOUSAND CUBIC FEET PER

00:49:21.492 --> 00:49:24.829 region:rollup2
SECOND OF FLOW OVER THE MAIN

00:49:23.093 --> 00:49:25.663 region:rollup2
SPILLWAY. THROUGH THIS WINTER

00:49:24.829 --> 00:49:27.898 region:rollup2
AND SPRING HOME.

00:49:25.663 --> 00:49:30.501 region:rollup2
SEASON.

00:49:27.898 --> 00:49:32.470 region:rollup2
IT'S IMPORTANT I THINK TO AND I

00:49:30.501 --> 00:49:33.804 region:rollup2
FLEW TO THIS BUT TO RECOGNIZE

00:49:32.470 --> 00:49:35.372 region:rollup2
THAT THE AMOUNT OF DESIGN AND

00:49:33.804 --> 00:49:37.308 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTION THAT THE DEPARTMENT

00:49:35.372 --> 00:49:40.644 region:rollup2
HAS IT WITH THEIR CONSULTANTS IN

00:49:37.308 --> 00:49:42.379 region:rollup2
OUTSIDE EXPERTISE HAS. COMPLETED

00:49:40.644 --> 00:49:43.948 region:rollup2
THIS LAST YEAR ERECTION REALLY

00:49:42.379 --> 00:49:45.916 region:rollup2
IN ABOUT SIX MONTHS IS

00:49:43.948 --> 00:49:47.451 region:rollup2
UNPRECEDENTED THIS IS USUALLY

00:49:45.916 --> 00:49:49.153 region:rollup2
MORE OF A FIVE YEAR IRISH

00:49:47.451 --> 00:49:50.754 region:rollup2
PROCESS BETWEEN DESIGN AND

00:49:49.153 --> 00:49:53.290 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTION. ON THOSE THAT'S

00:49:50.754 --> 00:49:54.692 region:rollup2
MORE NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES THIS

00:49:53.290 --> 00:49:57.595 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY WAS.

00:49:54.692 --> 00:49:59.864 region:rollup2
HUGE ENDEAVOR THAT TIME WE ARE

00:49:57.595 --> 00:50:01.765 region:rollup2
VERY HAPPY TO REPORT THAT WE MET

00:49:59.864 --> 00:50:03.534 region:rollup2
THE FIRST MAJOR MILESTONE. BUT

00:50:01.765 --> 00:50:04.101 region:rollup2
THE WORK IS NOT COMPLETE TWENTY

00:50:03.534 --> 00:50:06.437 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN LOOKS EVERY BIT AS

00:50:04.101 --> 00:50:08.339 region:rollup2
BUSY.

00:50:06.437 --> 00:50:10.174 region:rollup2
ON A WE HAVE A LOT MORE WORK TO

00:50:08.339 --> 00:50:11.542 region:rollup2
DO IN TERMS OF GETTING THE

00:50:10.174 --> 00:50:14.678 region:rollup2
EMERGENCY SPILLWAY.

00:50:11.542 --> 00:50:15.212 region:rollup2
REPAIRS DONE A HAND FINISHING

00:50:14.678 --> 00:50:18.949 region:rollup2
REPAIRS NEEDED TO THE MAIN

00:50:15.212 --> 00:50:21.552 region:rollup2
SPILLWAY.

00:50:18.949 --> 00:50:22.686 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE NEXT SLIDE IS THE A

00:50:21.552 --> 00:50:24.455 region:rollup2
GRAPHIC OF THE EMERGENCY

00:50:22.686 --> 00:50:26.323 region:rollup2
SPILLWAY A GIVES YOU A SENSE OF

00:50:24.455 --> 00:50:28.592 region:rollup2
THAT UNDERGROUND CUT OFF WALL

00:50:26.323 --> 00:50:30.261 region:rollup2
WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE. AND THE

00:50:28.592 --> 00:50:32.162 region:rollup2
AGAIN THE PURPOSE OF THAT IS TO

00:50:30.261 --> 00:50:34.665 region:rollup2
PREVENT UPHILL OR HAD CUTTING

00:50:32.162 --> 00:50:35.599 region:rollup2
EROSION SHOULD WE NEED TO USE

00:50:34.665 --> 00:50:38.769 region:rollup2
THE EMERGENCY SPILLWAY THE

00:50:35.599 --> 00:50:41.171 region:rollup2
SEASON.

00:50:38.769 --> 00:50:42.907 region:rollup2
AND THEN MY LAST SLIDE IS A

00:50:41.171 --> 00:50:46.076 region:rollup2
QUOTE FROM THE INDEPENDENT

00:50:42.907 --> 00:50:48.012 region:rollup2
FORENSIC TEAM REPORTS AND I

00:50:46.076 --> 00:50:49.747 region:rollup2
GUESS I WOULD READ IT THOUGH

00:50:48.012 --> 00:50:51.348 region:rollup2
THAT WE SENSIBLE AWKWARD BUT

00:50:49.747 --> 00:50:52.182 region:rollup2
FOUND LITTLE. TEA AT MY LAST

00:50:51.348 --> 00:50:53.951 region:rollup2
POINT I SUPPOSE.

00:50:52.182 --> 00:50:55.553 region:rollup2
SO THE QUOTE IS THE FACT THAT

00:50:53.951 --> 00:50:56.854 region:rollup2
THIS INCIDENT HAPPENED TO THE

00:50:55.553 --> 00:50:58.989 region:rollup2
OWNER OF THE TALLEST DAM IN THE

00:50:56.854 --> 00:51:00.758 region:rollup2
UNITED STATES. UNDER REGULATION

00:50:58.989 --> 00:51:02.960 region:rollup2
OF A FEDERAL AGENCY WITH

00:51:00.758 --> 00:51:04.929 region:rollup2
REPEATED EVALUATION BY REPUTABLE

00:51:02.960 --> 00:51:07.031 region:rollup2
OUTSIDE CONSULTANTS.

00:51:04.929 --> 00:51:08.832 region:rollup2
IS A STATE IN A STATE WITH THE

00:51:07.031 --> 00:51:10.968 region:rollup2
LEADING DAM SAFETY REGULATORY

00:51:08.832 --> 00:51:11.502 region:rollup2
PROGRAM IS A WAKE UP CALL FOR

00:51:10.968 --> 00:51:13.604 region:rollup2
EVERYONE INVOLVED IN DIEM

00:51:11.502 --> 00:51:15.239 region:rollup2
SAFETY.

00:51:13.604 --> 00:51:16.407 region:rollup2
CHALLENGING CURRENT ASSUMPTIONS

00:51:15.239 --> 00:51:18.509 region:rollup2
ON WHAT CONSTITUTES BEST

00:51:16.407 --> 00:51:20.344 region:rollup2
PRACTICE

00:51:18.509 --> 00:51:22.179 region:rollup2
IN OUR INDUSTRY IS OVERDUE.

00:51:20.344 --> 00:51:23.881 region:rollup2
AND SO WE WANTED TO TO POINT OUT

00:51:22.179 --> 00:51:25.249 region:rollup2
TO THIS QUOTE AGAIN WERE

00:51:23.881 --> 00:51:27.051 region:rollup2
APPRECIATIVE OF THE WORK THAT

00:51:25.249 --> 00:51:29.086 region:rollup2
FORENSIC TEAM HAS DONE BUT I

00:51:27.051 --> 00:51:30.921 region:rollup2
THINK THIS TRULY IS A HOME THERE

00:51:29.086 --> 00:51:32.756 region:rollup2
ARE MANY LESSONS TO BE LEARNED.

00:51:30.921 --> 00:51:34.391 region:rollup2
FROM WHAT HAPPENED LAST FEBRUARY

00:51:32.756 --> 00:51:35.859 region:rollup2
THE DEPARTMENT IS TAKING.

00:51:34.391 --> 00:51:37.661 region:rollup2
THE FINDINGS IN THE REPORT VERY

00:51:35.859 --> 00:51:38.996 region:rollup2
SERIOUSLY WE HAVE

00:51:37.661 --> 00:51:40.464 region:rollup2
BEGIN TO MAKE CHANGES WILL TALK

00:51:38.996 --> 00:51:42.266 region:rollup2
ABOUT THOSE THERE ARE MORE TO

00:51:40.464 --> 00:51:43.968 region:rollup2
COME. BUT THE INDUSTRY AS A

00:51:42.266 --> 00:51:45.402 region:rollup2
WHOLE I THINK NEEDS TO WE NEED

00:51:43.968 --> 00:51:46.503 region:rollup2
TO COLLECTIVELY MOVE THIS

00:51:45.402 --> 00:51:49.273 region:rollup2
FORWARD WITH THE INFORMATION WE

00:51:46.503 --> 00:51:51.575 region:rollup2
HAVE AT HAND.

00:51:49.273 --> 00:51:54.044 region:rollup2
SO WITH THAT I THINK I AM DONE

00:51:51.575 --> 00:51:56.246 region:rollup2
FOR NOW ENDS DO WE WANT TO GO

00:51:54.044 --> 00:51:58.115 region:rollup2
AHEAD AND MOVE THINGS OVER JUST

00:51:56.246 --> 00:52:01.118 region:rollup2
HARD BUT YOU COULDN'T GIVE

00:51:58.115 --> 00:52:02.753 region:rollup2
PRESENTATIONS WELL WE'RE GONNA.

00:52:01.118 --> 00:52:04.855 region:rollup2
WE'LL GO TO MR OKAY RISK

00:52:02.753 --> 00:52:07.224 region:rollup2
MISPRINTS IT BUT I DO HAVE ONE

00:52:04.855 --> 00:52:07.791 region:rollup2
QUESTION AND THEN I COULDN'T

00:52:07.224 --> 00:52:08.225 region:rollup2
WAIT TO QUESTIONS AT THE END

00:52:07.791 --> 00:52:09.460 region:rollup2
BUT.

00:52:08.225 --> 00:52:10.361 region:rollup2
YOU READ THAT LAST QUOTE SO.

00:52:09.460 --> 00:52:10.995 region:rollup2
ARE WE AWAKE.

00:52:10.361 --> 00:52:12.863 region:rollup2
WE ARE WEAK.

00:52:10.995 --> 00:52:13.764 region:rollup2

TEAM ON SOMETHING THAT'S ARE SO

00:52:35.119 --> 00:52:39.089 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT NOT JUST TO.

WATER PROJECT.

00:52:40.157 --> 00:52:43.694 region:rollup2
BUT TO THE ARE DAM SAFETY

00:52:42.159 --> 00:52:45.329 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY WHICH IS UP INDUSTRY

00:52:43.694 --> 00:52:46.830 region:rollup2
I'VE BEEN A PART OF FOR OVER

00:52:45.329 --> 00:52:49.133 region:rollup2
THIRTY YEARS NOW.

00:52:46.830 --> 00:52:51.335 region:rollup2
AND LOCAL TELL YOU THAT OUR OUR

THIS ON.

00:52:52.336 --> 00:52:55.839 region:rollup2
FEELING A PROFESSIONAL DUTY TO

00:52:54.505 --> 00:52:58.242 region:rollup2
DO THIS AS THOROUGHLY AND

00:52:55.839 --> 00:52:59.810 region:rollup2
COMPLETELY UNFAIRLY AS WE COULD.

00:52:58.242 --> 00:53:01.478 region:rollup2
AYE AND THAT'S THE WAY WE CHOSE

00:52:59.810 --> 00:53:02.780 region:rollup2
TO DO TO DO OUR SCI MED AND HOPE

00:53:01.478 --> 00:53:03.680 region:rollup2
THAT WE WERE SUCCESSFUL IN DOING

00:53:02.780 --> 00:53:03.881 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:05.649 region:rollup2
THE.

00:53:03.881 --> 00:53:08.052 region:rollup2
.

00:53:05.649 --> 00:53:08.686 region:rollup2
THE.

00:53:08.052 --> 00:53:09.620 region:rollup2
ONE THING I'VE LEARNED WORKING

00:53:08.686 --> 00:53:10.554 region:rollup2
MY FRIENDS OF THE COURT

00:53:09.620 --> 00:53:11.455 region:rollup2
ENGINEERS OVER THE LAST FEW

00:53:10.554 --> 00:53:12.923 region:rollup2
YEARS IS IN ALL THEIR

00:53:11.455 --> 00:53:14.158 region:rollup2
PRESENTATIONS THEY REQUIRE THE

00:53:12.923 --> 00:53:14.658 region:rollup2
PRESENTERS TO GIVE THE BOTTOM

00:53:14.158 --> 00:53:16.727 region:rollup2
LINE UP FRONT.

00:53:14.658 --> 00:53:17.961 region:rollup2
SORT OF.

00:53:16.727 --> 00:53:19.363 region:rollup2
WHAT WHAT ARE WE REALLY LEARNED

00:53:17.961 --> 00:53:20.197 region:rollup2
OUT OF THIS THING AND AND I TOOK

00:53:19.363 --> 00:53:22.633 region:rollup2
A QUOTE OUT OF?

00:53:20.197 --> 00:53:23.667 region:rollup2
THE SUMMARY OF OUR REPORT.

00:53:22.633 --> 00:53:25.669 region:rollup2
WHICH WAS THAT THE INCIDENT WAS

00:53:23.667 --> 00:53:27.604 region:rollup2
CAUSED BY A LONG TERM SYSTEMIC

00:53:25.669 --> 00:53:29.640 region:rollup2
FAILURE. OF THE D. W. OUR

00:53:27.604 --> 00:53:31.175 region:rollup2
REGULATORY AND GENERAL INDUSTRY

00:53:29.640 --> 00:53:32.810 region:rollup2
PRACTICES AND I WAS VERY

00:53:31.175 --> 00:53:34.711 region:rollup2
CAREFULLY PUT TOGETHER THAT IT'S

00:53:32.810 --> 00:53:37.147 region:rollup2
THE IT'S THE SYSTEM AND IT'S NOT

00:53:34.711 --> 00:53:39.116 region:rollup2
JUST THE W. ARE IT'S ITS DEBUT

00:53:37.147 --> 00:53:40.184 region:rollup2
ARE THE REGULATORS. OF THE

00:53:39.116 --> 00:53:42.152 region:rollup2
CONSULTANTS WHO WERE WORKING IN

00:53:40.184 --> 00:53:43.287 region:rollup2
S. EVERYONE AND A HAND IN THIS

00:53:42.152 --> 00:53:44.855 region:rollup2
EVERITT A LOT OF PEOPLE TOUCH

00:53:43.287 --> 00:53:48.125 region:rollup2
THIS PROJECT SO.

00:53:44.855 --> 00:53:49.393 region:rollup2
IT INVOLVED A LOT OF PEOPLE SO

00:53:48.125 --> 00:53:50.861 region:rollup2
IS A FAILURE OF OF THAT.

00:53:49.393 --> 00:53:52.563 region:rollup2
PRACTICE TO RECOGNIZE AND

00:53:50.861 --> 00:53:53.864 region:rollup2
ADDRESS WHAT WERE INHERENT

00:53:52.563 --> 00:53:56.400 region:rollup2
SPILLWAY DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION

00:53:53.864 --> 00:53:57.835 region:rollup2
WEAKNESSES POOR BEDROCK QUALITY.

00:53:56.400 --> 00:53:59.570 region:rollup2
AND TERRY DETERIORATED SERVICE

00:53:57.835 --> 00:54:01.371 region:rollup2
SPILLWAYS SHOOT CONDITIONS.

00:53:59.570 --> 00:54:03.273 region:rollup2
AND BECAUSE OF THAT SORT OF

00:54:01.371 --> 00:54:04.742 region:rollup2
BROUGHT EVERYBODY TOUCHING IT WE

00:54:03.273 --> 00:54:07.578 region:rollup2
REALLY CAN'T REASONABLY BLAME A

00:54:04.742 --> 00:54:09.113 region:rollup2
SINGLE ORGANIZATION OR SINGLE

00:54:07.578 --> 00:54:10.948 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL. AND AIR THAT THAT

00:54:09.113 --> 00:54:12.015 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT. ALWAYS SATISFYING TO

00:54:10.948 --> 00:54:14.051 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WHO WOULD LIKE TO FIND

00:54:12.015 --> 00:54:15.519 region:rollup2
SOMEONE OR SOME ORGANIZATION

00:54:14.051 --> 00:54:17.354 region:rollup2
THAT WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS.

00:54:15.519 --> 00:54:19.123 region:rollup2
BUT BECAUSE SO MANY PEOPLE

00:54:17.354 --> 00:54:21.525 region:rollup2
TOUCHED IT WE ALL TO SOME DEGREE

00:54:19.123 --> 00:54:22.159 region:rollup2
SHARE THE BLAME FOR THIS THING.

00:54:21.525 --> 00:54:25.362 region:rollup2
AND AS AN INDUSTRY.

00:54:22.159 --> 00:54:27.064 region:rollup2
IT LIKE OTHER INDUSTRIES A WE

00:54:25.362 --> 00:54:28.632 region:rollup2
NEED TO LEARN FROM FROM WHAT

00:54:27.064 --> 00:54:30.000 region:rollup2
HAPPENED IF I THINK IF YOU LOOK

00:59:49.386 --> 00:59:52.456 region:rollup2
AND US.

00:59:51.488 --> 00:59:52.956 region:rollup2
IN LESS A CORD OR SOME LEGAL

00:59:52.456 --> 00:59:53.957 region:rollup2
ENTITY CAME FORWARD AND

00:59:52.956 --> 00:59:55.992 region:rollup2
COMPELLED US.

00:59:53.957 --> 00:59:57.828 region:rollup2
SO WE WE WANTED THEM TO BE

00:59:55.992 --> 00:59:59.830 region:rollup2
FRANK AND FORTHCOMING AND WE WE

00:59:57.828 --> 01:00:01.097 region:rollup2
PROVIDED THAT ASSURANCE TO THEM.

00:59:59.830 --> 01:00:02.432 region:rollup2
I AND THEN WE HAD A NUMBER OF

01:00:01.097 --> 01:00:04.034 region:rollup2
WORKING SESSIONS AMONGST OUR

01:00:02.432 --> 01:00:05.135 region:rollup2
GROUP BECAUSE AS YOU CAN IMAGINE

01:00:04.034 --> 01:00:07.337 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU START TO LOOK AT THIS

01:00:05.135 --> 01:00:08.305 region:rollup2
INFORMATION. YOU COME AWAY WITH

01:00:07.337 --> 01:00:09.873 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT IMPRESSIONS AND YOU

01:00:08.305 --> 01:00:11.608 region:rollup2
HAVE TO TALK THOSE THROUGH AND

01:00:09.873 --> 01:00:13.176 region:rollup2
COME TO A COMMON CONSENSUS ON

01:00:11.608 --> 01:00:15.011 region:rollup2
WHAT WE AS A GROUP THINK.

01:00:13.176 --> 01:00:16.146 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES YOU CAN SEE WHAT

01:00:15.011 --> 01:00:17.214 region:rollup2
HAPPENED YOU SEE SOME

01:00:16.146 --> 01:00:18.915 region:rollup2
INFORMATION AND YOU AB ONE

01:00:17.214 --> 01:00:19.950 region:rollup2
INTERPRETATION OF IT SOMEBODY

01:00:18.915 --> 01:00:21.051 region:rollup2
ELSE ON THE TEAM MIGHT HAVE A

01:00:19.950 --> 01:00:22.252 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT WHEN IT WE TALKED AT

01:00:21.051 --> 01:00:23.987 region:rollup2
THROUGH IN. AND CAME TO A

01:00:22.252 --> 01:00:25.188 region:rollup2
CONSENSUS TO I CAN TELL YOU

01:00:23.987 --> 01:00:27.023 region:rollup2
CONFIDENTLY THAT REPORT IS A

01:00:25.188 --> 01:00:27.858 region:rollup2
CONSENSUS THAT ALL SIX MEMBERS

01:00:27.023 --> 01:00:30.093 region:rollup2
STAND BEHIND.

01:00:27.858 --> 01:00:31.261 region:rollup2
.

01:00:30.093 --> 01:00:32.796 region:rollup2
VERY BRIEFLY FOR SOME OF THE

01:00:31.261 --> 01:00:33.997 region:rollup2
CONTENT OF THE REPORT OF THE

01:00:32.796 --> 01:00:35.632 region:rollup2
WHAT HAPPENED THIS IS THE

01:00:33.997 --> 01:00:38.034 region:rollup2
PHYSICS OF WHAT HAPPENED.

01:00:35.632 --> 01:00:38.602 region:rollup2
THIS IS THE FIFTH SLIDE IN IN

01:00:38.034 --> 01:00:39.336 region:rollup2
THE PACKET THAT WAS GIVEN TO

01:00:38.602 --> 01:00:41.138 region:rollup2
YOU.

01:00:39.336 --> 01:00:41.671 region:rollup2
UP WITH REGARD TO THE SERVICE

01:00:41.138 --> 01:00:43.940 region:rollup2
BILL WAY.

01:00:41.671 --> 01:00:45.642 region:rollup2
YOU'VE PROBABLY HEARD THIS AND

01:00:43.940 --> 01:00:46.910 region:rollup2
PREVIOUSLY BUT WHAT WE BELIEVE

01:00:45.642 --> 01:00:48.378 region:rollup2
HAPPENED THIS IS SOMEWHERE IN

01:00:46.910 --> 01:00:49.246 region:rollup2
THIS.

01:00:48.378 --> 01:00:51.648 region:rollup2
AREA OF.

01:00:49.246 --> 01:00:53.483 region:rollup2
BETWEEN THIRTY FOUR PLUS ZERO

01:00:51.648 --> 01:00:55.218 region:rollup2
ZERO AND THIRTY THREE PLUS ZERO

01:00:53.483 --> 01:00:56.786 region:rollup2
ZERO THAT SHOWN ON THAT FIGURE.

01:00:55.218 --> 01:00:58.555 region:rollup2
SOMEWHERE WITHIN THAT AREA A

01:00:56.786 --> 01:01:00.957 region:rollup2
SECTION OF THE CONCRETE SHOOTS

01:00:58.555 --> 01:01:02.459 region:rollup2
LAB WAS LIFTED UP. BY PRESSURE

01:01:00.957 --> 01:01:03.560 region:rollup2
WATER PRESSURE UNDERNEATH OF IT

01:01:02.459 --> 01:01:04.928 region:rollup2
BEING GREATER THAN THE

01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:05.529 region:rollup2
RESISTANCE THAT THAT SECTION OUT

01:01:04.928 --> 01:01:06.663 region:rollup2
AND IT COULD HAVE BEEN A SMALL

01:01:05.529 --> 01:01:07.931 region:rollup2
SECTION.

01:01:06.663 --> 01:01:09.099 region:rollup2
IT COULD HAVE BEEN A COUPLE FEET

01:01:07.931 --> 01:01:11.635 region:rollup2
BY A COUPLE FEET IT COULD HAVE

01:01:09.099 --> 01:01:13.169 region:rollup2
BEEN LARGER. BUT ONCE IT LIFTED

01:01:11.635 --> 01:01:16.439 region:rollup2
WHAT HAPPENS IS WHEN YOU HAVE A

01:01:13.169 --> 01:01:18.141 region:rollup2
SECTION OF SLAB THAT LIFTS INTO.

01:01:16.439 --> 01:01:19.142 region:rollup2
INTO HIGH FULL OF THEIR VERY

01:01:18.141 --> 01:01:21.077 region:rollup2
QUICKLY FLOWING WATER LIKE ELLEN

01:01:19.142 --> 01:01:22.512 region:rollup2
THE SHOOT THAT WATER HITS.

01:01:21.077 --> 01:01:24.447 region:rollup2
THAT FACE THE CONCRETE AND THE

01:01:22.512 --> 01:01:25.949 region:rollup2
CONCRETE STOPS THE WATER AND

01:01:24.447 --> 01:01:27.350 region:rollup2
WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT KINETIC

01:01:25.949 --> 01:01:29.052 region:rollup2
ENERGY OF THE VELOCITY THE WATER

01:01:27.350 --> 01:01:30.187 region:rollup2
THEN GETS TURNED INTO PRESSURE.

01:01:29.052 --> 01:01:31.588 region:rollup2
THAT PRESSURE GROWS UNDERNEATH

01:01:30.187 --> 01:01:32.422 region:rollup2
THE SLAB AND JUST INCREASES THE

01:01:31.588 --> 01:01:33.690 region:rollup2
PRESSURE AND CONTINUES TO LIFT

01:01:32.422 --> 01:01:35.492 region:rollup2
IT UP.

01:01:33.690 --> 01:01:36.960 region:rollup2
SO IT LIFTED UP AND WHAT

01:01:35.492 --> 01:01:38.862 region:rollup2
HAPPENED IS WHEN IT LIFTED UP

01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:40.497 region:rollup2
THE FOUNDATION IN THIS AREA WAS

01:01:38.862 --> 01:01:40.997 region:rollup2
STRONGLY WEATHERED ROCK POP

01:01:40.497 --> 01:01:42.699 region:rollup2
POSSIBLY EVEN SOIL LIKE

01:01:40.997 --> 01:01:43.800 region:rollup2
MATERIAL.

01:01:42.699 --> 01:01:45.168 region:rollup2
AND AS SOON AS THAT CHUNK OF

01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:47.103 region:rollup2
SLAB WAS GONE IN THAT HIGH

01:01:45.168 --> 01:01:48.572 region:rollup2
VELOCITY FLOW HITS THAT MATERIAL

01:01:47.103 --> 01:01:50.840 region:rollup2
RICHES STARTS TO A ROAD. AND

01:01:48.572 --> 01:01:52.776 region:rollup2
THEN IT JUST GOES OUT OF CONTROL

01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:53.610 region:rollup2
INTO ROADS AND REMOVE SLABS AND

01:01:52.776 --> 01:01:55.211 region:rollup2
WE CREATED THE WHOLE THAT WE SAW

01:01:53.610 --> 01:01:57.013 region:rollup2
THERE SO THAT'S THAT THE PHYSICS

01:01:55.211 --> 01:01:58.181 region:rollup2
OF WHAT HAPPENED WE BELIEVE IN

01:01:57.013 --> 01:01:59.549 region:rollup2
THE SERVICE BUT WAY.

01:01:58.181 --> 01:02:01.251 region:rollup2
THE EMERGENCY SPILLWAY EVERYONE

01:01:59.549 --> 01:02:03.186 region:rollup2
GOT TO WATCH THAT HAPPEN.

01:02:01.251 --> 01:02:04.688 region:rollup2
AND A WHAT HAPPENED THERE IS

01:02:03.186 --> 01:02:05.222 region:rollup2
WHEN THE WATER BEGAN TO FLOW

01:02:04.688 --> 01:02:06.790 region:rollup2
OVER THE.

01:02:05.222 --> 01:02:08.491 region:rollup2
THE HILLSIDE DOWNSTREAM OF THE

01:02:06.790 --> 01:02:11.027 region:rollup2
CONCRETE STRUCTURES.

01:02:08.491 --> 01:02:12.295 region:rollup2
IT FOUND PLACES WHERE THERE WAS

01:02:11.027 --> 01:02:14.731 region:rollup2
STRONGLY WEATHERED ROCK.

01:02:12.295 --> 01:02:17.033 region:rollup2
TO DEPP'S GREATER THAN A FEW

01:02:14.731 --> 01:02:20.170 region:rollup2
FEET AND IT STARTED TO A ROAD

01:02:17.033 --> 01:02:22.405 region:rollup2
DOES IT WAS PROBABLY AIDED BY. A

01:02:20.170 --> 01:02:23.373 region:rollup2
CONCENTRATIONS IN TOPOGRAPHY AND

01:02:22.405 --> 01:02:25.375 region:rollup2
PERHAPS SOME OF THE

01:02:23.373 --> 01:02:26.876 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE LIKE ROADS AND

01:02:25.375 --> 01:02:27.844 region:rollup2
OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WOULD

01:02:26.876 --> 01:02:30.013 region:rollup2
CONCENTRATE THAT FLOW AND

01:02:27.844 --> 01:02:31.748 region:rollup2
CONCENTRATE THE EROSIVE FORCES.

01:02:30.013 --> 01:02:33.016 region:rollup2
THOSE AREAS OF STRONGLY

01:02:31.748 --> 01:02:34.684 region:rollup2
WEATHERED ROCK HAPPEN TO BE

01:02:33.016 --> 01:02:36.353 region:rollup2
ORIENTED IN A WAY THAT WHEN IT

01:02:34.684 --> 01:02:38.488 region:rollup2
STARTED TO ROAD THEY BEGAN

01:02:36.353 --> 01:02:39.923 region:rollup2
MOVING TOWARDS THE SPILLWAY AND

01:02:38.488 --> 01:02:40.724 region:rollup2
AS THEY MOVE TOWARDS THIS BILL

01:02:39.923 --> 01:02:42.859 region:rollup2
WHEN THEY MOVE. RELATIVELY

01:02:40.724 --> 01:02:46.196 region:rollup2
QUICKLY AND THE.

01:02:42.859 --> 01:02:47.063 region:rollup2
THE DECISION TO TO EVACUATE

01:02:46.196 --> 01:02:49.466 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY IN OUR VIEW WAS A

01:02:47.063 --> 01:02:51.034 region:rollup2
PRUDENT ONE AT THAT POINT TIME

01:02:49.466 --> 01:02:51.568 region:rollup2
THERE WAS NO CHOICE BUT TO MAKE.

01:02:51.034 --> 01:02:54.271 region:rollup2
THAT DECISION IN THE THE

01:02:51.568 --> 01:02:55.572 region:rollup2
INTEREST OF PUBLIC SAFETY.

01:02:54.271 --> 01:02:55.772 region:rollup2
ARE MOVING ON TO THE THE SIX

01:02:55.572 --> 01:02:57.674 region:rollup2
LIED.

01:02:55.772 --> 01:02:58.775 region:rollup2
.

01:02:57.674 --> 01:03:02.579 region:rollup2
VOTES TITLED WHY THE INCIDENT

01:02:58.775 --> 01:03:04.347 region:rollup2
HAPPENED SERVICE SPILLWAY.

01:03:02.579 --> 01:03:05.315 region:rollup2
IT MIGHT ALSO BE TITLED.

01:03:04.347 --> 01:03:07.183 region:rollup2
COME WHY DID WE NOT EXPECT THAT

01:03:05.315 --> 01:03:08.485 region:rollup2
TO HAPPEN.

01:03:07.183 --> 01:03:10.086 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT REALLY IS HIS INTO

01:03:08.485 --> 01:03:11.287 region:rollup2
THE QUESTION OF WHY DID WE NOT

01:03:10.086 --> 01:03:13.089 region:rollup2
KNOW AHEAD OF TIME THIS THIS IS

01:03:11.287 --> 01:03:14.257 region:rollup2
HAPPENING.

01:03:13.089 --> 01:03:16.059 region:rollup2
AND AND THE Y..

01:03:14.257 --> 01:03:17.360 region:rollup2
HAD IT HAPPENED.

01:03:16.059 --> 01:03:19.562 region:rollup2
FROM THE HUMAN ORGANIZATIONAL

01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:21.064 region:rollup2
SIDE IS THAT WE. AS WE DUG INTO

01:03:19.562 --> 01:03:21.598 region:rollup2
THIS WE FOUND IS IS HAS

01:03:21.064 --> 01:03:23.867 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTED THAT SPILLWAYS

01:03:21.598 --> 01:03:25.335 region:rollup2
SHOOT.

01:03:23.867 --> 01:03:26.936 region:rollup2
WAS INCOMPATIBLE WITH ITS

01:03:25.335 --> 01:03:28.071 region:rollup2
FOUNDATION AND HYDRAULIC

01:03:26.936 --> 01:03:29.839 region:rollup2
CONDITIONS THE HYDRAULIC

01:03:28.071 --> 01:03:31.374 region:rollup2
CONDITIONS BEING THE VERY HIGH

01:03:29.839 --> 01:03:33.143 region:rollup2
VELOCITY FLOWS OF WATER. THE

01:03:31.374 --> 01:03:33.743 region:rollup2
FOUNDATION BEING THAT IN PLACES

01:03:33.143 --> 01:03:35.645 region:rollup2
RATHER THAN BEING CONSTRUCTED

01:03:33.743 --> 01:03:37.881 region:rollup2
ON.

01:03:35.645 --> 01:03:39.516 region:rollup2
A RELATIVELY SOUND ROCK WHICH

01:03:37.881 --> 01:03:41.284 region:rollup2
WITH THE DESIGNERS INTENT IT

01:03:39.516 --> 01:03:42.619 region:rollup2
ENDED UP BEING CONSTRUCTED ON

01:03:41.284 --> 01:03:44.020 region:rollup2
STRONGLY WEATHERED ROCK.

01:03:42.619 --> 01:03:46.289 region:rollup2
OVER IN PARTICULAR IN THE AREA

01:03:44.020 --> 01:03:48.792 region:rollup2
WHERE THE SHOOT FAILED.

01:03:46.289 --> 01:03:50.193 region:rollup2
THE SO THE SLAB HAD FROM THE

01:03:48.792 --> 01:03:51.861 region:rollup2
VERY BEGINNING IN NINETEEN SIXTY

01:03:50.193 --> 01:03:53.096 region:rollup2
NINE THERE WERE CRACKS.

01:03:51.861 --> 01:03:54.364 region:rollup2
OVER TOP OF THE DRAINS UNDER THE

01:03:53.096 --> 01:03:55.865 region:rollup2
SLAB BECAUSE OF THE WAY THE

01:03:54.364 --> 01:03:57.233 region:rollup2
DRAINS.

01:03:55.865 --> 01:03:58.401 region:rollup2
THE IN THE CONCRETE SECTION

01:03:57.233 --> 01:03:59.703 region:rollup2
ABOVE THE THE SLAPPING AS THE

01:03:58.401 --> 01:04:01.738 region:rollup2
SLABS

01:03:59.703 --> 01:04:03.573 region:rollup2
OCT CURED AFTER BEING PLACED

01:04:01.738 --> 01:04:05.241 region:rollup2
CRACKS DEVELOPED OVER THOSE THAT

01:04:03.573 --> 01:04:06.609 region:rollup2
DRAINS IN THOSE CRACKS EXTENDED

01:04:05.241 --> 01:04:08.478 region:rollup2
ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE CONCRETE

01:04:06.609 --> 01:04:10.113 region:rollup2
SECTION DOWN TO THE DRAIN. SO

01:04:08.478 --> 01:04:11.214 region:rollup2
THEY ALLOWED WATER TO ENTER. IN

01:04:10.113 --> 01:04:12.582 region:rollup2
ADDITION THE.

01:04:11.214 --> 01:04:13.917 region:rollup2
THE JOINTS BETWEEN THE

01:04:12.582 --> 01:04:15.618 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT PANELS OF THE SLAB DID

01:04:13.917 --> 01:04:16.686 region:rollup2
NOT HAVE WATER STOPS.

01:04:15.618 --> 01:04:18.088 region:rollup2
WHICH IS SOMETHING WE COMMONLY

01:04:16.686 --> 01:04:20.223 region:rollup2
DO TODAY SO THIS WOULD BE A

01:04:18.088 --> 01:04:21.591 region:rollup2
RUBBER. GASKET IF YOU LIKE

01:04:20.223 --> 01:04:22.592 region:rollup2
ACROSS THE JOINTS THAT WATER

01:04:21.591 --> 01:04:24.627 region:rollup2
COULDN'T PENETRATE SO THOSE

01:04:22.592 --> 01:04:25.161 region:rollup2
JOINTS WERE DID NOT HAVE THAT'S

01:04:24.627 --> 01:04:26.396 region:rollup2
WATER CA GOING THROUGH THE

01:04:25.161 --> 01:04:27.797 region:rollup2
JOINTS.

01:04:26.396 --> 01:04:30.266 region:rollup2
SO AS A RESULT.

01:04:27.797 --> 01:04:31.468 region:rollup2
WHENEVER THIS BILL WE OPERATED

01:04:30.266 --> 01:04:32.335 region:rollup2
THOSE UNDER DRAINS WOULD FLOW IN

01:04:31.468 --> 01:04:34.871 region:rollup2
THAT FLOW A LOT THEY WERE

01:04:32.335 --> 01:04:36.239 region:rollup2
ORIGINALLY INTENDED. TO.

01:04:34.871 --> 01:04:36.906 region:rollup2
TO COLLECT MINIMAL GROUNDWATER

01:04:36.239 --> 01:04:37.974 region:rollup2
THAT HAVE BEEN ENCOUNTERED

01:04:36.906 --> 01:04:39.409 region:rollup2
DURING INVESTIGATIONS BUT

01:04:37.974 --> 01:04:40.009 region:rollup2
INSTEAD THEY WERE COLLECTING

01:04:39.409 --> 01:04:41.211 region:rollup2
THIS WATER COMING THROUGH THE

01:04:40.009 --> 01:04:42.846 region:rollup2
CHUTE.

01:04:41.211 --> 01:04:44.381 region:rollup2
AND THAT WAS OBSERVED AGAIN

01:04:42.846 --> 01:04:46.082 region:rollup2
FIRST TIME THIS BILL WE OPERATED

01:04:44.381 --> 01:04:48.752 region:rollup2
NINETEEN SIXTY NINE. QUESTION

01:04:46.082 --> 01:04:50.787 region:rollup2
WAS RAISED ABOUT IS THIS NORMAL

01:04:48.752 --> 01:04:51.087 region:rollup2
DISTRICT WE PLEA SAW DOCUMENT

01:04:50.787 --> 01:04:54.324 region:rollup2
THAT SAID.

01:04:51.087 --> 01:04:55.592 region:rollup2
DESIGNERS ARE LOOK AT THIS AND

01:04:54.324 --> 01:04:57.394 region:rollup2
WE DIDN'T SEE ANY FOLLOW UP TO

01:04:55.592 --> 01:04:59.195 region:rollup2
THAT THERE WAS NO INDICATION

01:04:57.394 --> 01:05:00.997 region:rollup2
THAT SOMEONE LOOKED AT IT SAID

01:04:59.195 --> 01:05:02.499 region:rollup2
YES IT'S OKAY SOMEONE LOOKED AT

01:05:00.997 --> 01:05:03.700 region:rollup2
ITS IT NOW TO PROBLEM IT JUST.

01:05:02.499 --> 01:05:04.934 region:rollup2
IT WAS SO THE ONE DOCUMENTS THAT

01:05:03.700 --> 01:05:06.369 region:rollup2
LOOK AT IT AND NOTHING FURTHER

01:05:04.934 --> 01:05:06.669 region:rollup2
AND THEN WHAT SEEMS TO HAVE

01:05:06.369 --> 01:05:07.036 region:rollup2
HAPPENED IS.

01:05:06.669 --> 01:05:09.372 region:rollup2
.

01:05:07.036 --> 01:05:11.174 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:05:09.372 --> 01:05:12.876 region:rollup2
THE CRACKS IN THE BRAIN FLOWS

01:05:11.174 --> 01:05:14.544 region:rollup2
BECAME NORMALIZED.

01:05:12.876 --> 01:05:16.546 region:rollup2
THERE'S A CONCEPT WE TALK ABOUT

01:05:14.544 --> 01:05:18.148 region:rollup2
IT ACTUALLY DEVELOPED FROM THE.

01:05:16.546 --> 01:05:19.983 region:rollup2
THE SPACE SHUTTLE CHALLENGER

01:05:18.148 --> 01:05:21.618 region:rollup2
DISASTER A NORMALISATION THE

01:05:19.983 --> 01:05:23.119 region:rollup2
DEVIANTS WHERE SPACE SHUTTLE

01:05:21.618 --> 01:05:24.487 region:rollup2
CHALLENGER IF YOU REMEMBER.

01:05:23.119 --> 01:05:25.722 region:rollup2
THERE WAS WHEN THEY WENT BACK

01:05:24.487 --> 01:05:26.990 region:rollup2
AND LOOKED THERE WAS A LOT OF

01:05:25.722 --> 01:05:29.058 region:rollup2
QUESTION ABOUT THE O. RINGS THAT

01:05:26.990 --> 01:05:31.060 region:rollup2
ULTIMATELY FAILED YEARS BEFORE

01:05:29.058 --> 01:05:32.295 region:rollup2
THAT FAILURE BUT THEY CONTINUED

01:05:31.060 --> 01:05:33.463 region:rollup2
TO HAVE LUNCH AFTER LAUNCH THAT

01:05:32.295 --> 01:05:34.964 region:rollup2
WORKED.

01:05:33.463 --> 01:05:36.800 region:rollup2
AND EVEN THOUGH THE O. RINGS

01:05:34.964 --> 01:05:38.601 region:rollup2
WERE WORKING IT WAS A. DEPARTURE

01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:40.236 region:rollup2
FROM WHAT WAS EXPECTED.

01:05:38.601 --> 01:05:41.805 region:rollup2
BECAME ACCEPTED AS NORMAL AND

01:05:40.236 --> 01:05:43.907 region:rollup2
ULTIMATELY LED TO THE CHALLENGER

01:05:41.805 --> 01:05:45.441 region:rollup2
IN THIS CASE. THESE CRACKS IN

01:05:43.907 --> 01:05:47.310 region:rollup2
THOSE FLOWS BECAME ACCEPTED AS

01:05:45.441 --> 01:05:48.711 region:rollup2
NORMAL AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT ALL

01:05:47.310 --> 01:05:49.846 region:rollup2
THE EXPECTATION REPORTS THEY

01:05:48.711 --> 01:05:51.114 region:rollup2
NOTE THE CRACKS ARE THERE THE

01:05:49.846 --> 01:05:52.749 region:rollup2
DURING FLOWS IT THERE. BUT

01:05:51.114 --> 01:05:53.683 region:rollup2
THERE'S NO.

01:05:52.749 --> 01:05:54.584 region:rollup2
COMMENT OR CONCERN AS TO WHAT

01:05:53.683 --> 01:05:56.119 region:rollup2
WHAT THE WHAT WAS WRONG WITH

01:05:54.584 --> 01:05:57.921 region:rollup2
THEM.

01:05:56.119 --> 01:05:59.889 region:rollup2
SUBSEQUENT SECTIONS EVALUATIONS

01:05:57.921 --> 01:06:01.724 region:rollup2
DIDN'T IDENTIFY.

01:05:59.889 --> 01:06:03.960 region:rollup2
AND THEN BECAUSE IT WASN'T

01:06:01.724 --> 01:06:05.628 region:rollup2
IDENTIFIED AS A SERIOUS DEFECT

01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:07.197 region:rollup2
THE REPAIRS TENDED TO BE

01:06:05.628 --> 01:06:08.598 region:rollup2
RELATIVELY SHALL REPAIRS THAT

01:06:07.197 --> 01:06:10.533 region:rollup2
JUST RESTORED.

01:06:08.598 --> 01:06:12.635 region:rollup2
THE SURFACE OF THE SLAB TO A

01:06:10.533 --> 01:06:14.270 region:rollup2
SMOOTH UNIFORM SURFACE RATHER

01:06:12.635 --> 01:06:16.206 region:rollup2
THAN RECOGNIZING THAT THERE WAS

01:06:14.270 --> 01:06:17.340 region:rollup2
THIS INHERENT PROBLEM. A WITH

01:06:16.206 --> 01:06:18.808 region:rollup2
THE SLAP IN WHICH FOUNDATION TO

01:06:17.340 --> 01:06:20.543 region:rollup2
THE SLAB.

01:06:18.808 --> 01:06:22.846 region:rollup2
SO THOSE ARE THE WHY IT HAPPENED

01:06:20.543 --> 01:06:23.780 region:rollup2
WITH THE THE SERVICE BILL WAY.

01:06:22.846 --> 01:06:25.648 region:rollup2
THE EMERGENCY SPILLWAY.

01:06:23.780 --> 01:06:27.050 region:rollup2
.

01:06:25.648 --> 01:06:28.718 region:rollup2
WHAT THE BIGGEST THING THAT WE

01:06:27.050 --> 01:06:30.787 region:rollup2
POINT OUT THERE IS THAT THE?

01:06:28.718 --> 01:06:31.888 region:rollup2
OVER TIME THE GEOLOGY OF THE

01:06:30.787 --> 01:06:33.590 region:rollup2
HILLSIDE REALLY BECAME MISS

01:06:31.888 --> 01:06:34.958 region:rollup2
UNDERSTOOD.

01:06:33.590 --> 01:06:36.426 region:rollup2
A WHEN WE GO BACK AND LOOK AT

01:06:34.958 --> 01:06:38.495 region:rollup2
THE GEOLOGY REPORTS FROM THE

01:06:36.426 --> 01:06:40.330 region:rollup2
DESIGN PERIOD NINETEEN SIXTY TO

01:06:38.495 --> 01:06:42.832 region:rollup2
NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR. WE SEE

01:06:40.330 --> 01:06:44.601 region:rollup2
DRILL HOLE LOGS AND WE SEE A THE

01:06:42.832 --> 01:06:45.835 region:rollup2
TEXT IN THE REPORTS THAT

01:06:44.601 --> 01:06:46.903 region:rollup2
INDICATE THAT THAT HILLSIDE

01:06:45.835 --> 01:06:48.071 region:rollup2
ALTHOUGH IT'S THE FEEBLE LIGHT

01:06:46.903 --> 01:06:50.106 region:rollup2
ROCK THAT HAS A LOT OF GOOD

01:06:48.071 --> 01:06:51.574 region:rollup2
QUALITY ROCK. IT ALSO HAS SOME

01:06:50.106 --> 01:06:54.110 region:rollup2
AREAS OF DEEPER STRONGLY

01:06:51.574 --> 01:06:55.945 region:rollup2
WEATHERED ROCK. UP TO TEN TEN

01:06:54.110 --> 01:06:57.847 region:rollup2
FEET TWENTY FEET TENS OF FEET.

01:06:55.945 --> 01:06:59.249 region:rollup2
INTO THE ROCK OF THAT'S IN

01:06:57.847 --> 01:07:00.917 region:rollup2
THOSE FIRST COUPLE OF REPORTS

01:06:59.249 --> 01:07:02.385 region:rollup2
THAT THE REPORT THAT WAS DONE

01:07:00.917 --> 01:07:04.120 region:rollup2
RIGHT AFTER CONSTRUCTION THE

01:07:02.385 --> 01:07:04.888 region:rollup2
GEOLOGY REPORT.

01:07:04.120 --> 01:07:07.156 region:rollup2
IT DOESN'T INCLUDE THE DRILL

01:07:04.888 --> 01:07:09.225 region:rollup2
HOLES. AND THEN IT.

01:07:07.156 --> 01:07:11.661 region:rollup2
IT FURTHER.

01:07:09.225 --> 01:07:13.429 region:rollup2
HAS SOME STATEMENTS THAT GIVE

01:07:11.661 --> 01:07:14.964 region:rollup2
AN IMPRESSION THAT THE HILLSIDES

01:07:13.429 --> 01:07:17.166 region:rollup2
FEES AWFULLY GOOD.

01:07:14.964 --> 01:07:18.668 region:rollup2
AND WHAT HAPPENED OVER TIME

01:07:17.166 --> 01:07:20.837 region:rollup2
APPARENTLY IS THAT.

01:07:18.668 --> 01:07:23.072 region:rollup2
BETTER INTERPRETATION OF THE

01:07:20.837 --> 01:07:24.841 region:rollup2
HILLSIDE IS WHAT. COLLECTIVELY

01:07:23.072 --> 01:07:26.509 region:rollup2
GOT INTO THE MINDS OF OF THE

01:07:24.841 --> 01:07:28.044 region:rollup2
FOLKS WHO WERE MANAGING THE

01:07:26.509 --> 01:07:28.645 region:rollup2
PROJECT IN THE HILLSIDE WAS

01:07:28.044 --> 01:07:30.013 region:rollup2
THOUGHT OF THOUGHT TO BE VERY

01:07:28.645 --> 01:07:31.915 region:rollup2
GOOD.

01:07:30.013 --> 01:07:33.483 region:rollup2
A THE BEST EXAMPLES OF THAT ARE

01:07:31.915 --> 01:07:35.618 region:rollup2
IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE.

01:07:33.483 --> 01:07:37.553 region:rollup2
THERE WAS A MEMO ON THAT WAS

01:07:35.618 --> 01:07:38.922 region:rollup2
WRITTEN IN RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS

01:07:37.553 --> 01:07:41.090 region:rollup2
THAT CAME UP DURING THE FOR

01:07:38.922 --> 01:07:42.625 region:rollup2
RELICENSING PROCESS.

01:07:41.090 --> 01:07:43.927 region:rollup2
AND THAT PRODUCE SEEMS PRETTY

01:07:42.625 --> 01:07:45.628 region:rollup2
STRONG LANGUAGE CHARACTERIZES

01:07:43.927 --> 01:07:47.297 region:rollup2
THE ROCK.

01:07:45.628 --> 01:07:49.165 region:rollup2
IN THE HILLSIDE DOWNSTREAM OF

01:07:47.297 --> 01:07:51.000 region:rollup2
THE MERCY SPILLWAY AS BEING VERY

01:07:49.165 --> 01:07:52.268 region:rollup2
GOOD QUALITY.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:54.504 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY EROSION RESISTANT

01:07:52.268 --> 01:07:56.873 region:rollup2
ROCK IT AT THE SAME TIME IT

01:07:54.504 --> 01:07:58.274 region:rollup2
INCLUDED BORE HOLES THAT WERE.

01:07:56.873 --> 01:07:59.175 region:rollup2
WHERE THE CREST STRUCTURE IS IN

01:07:58.274 --> 01:08:00.777 region:rollup2
THE EMERGENCY SPILLWAY BUT NONE

01:07:59.175 --> 01:08:01.978 region:rollup2
THE LESS

01:08:00.777 --> 01:08:03.046 region:rollup2
SOME OF THOSE BORE HOLE DID

01:08:01.978 --> 01:08:04.981 region:rollup2
SHOW WEATHERED ROCK TO

01:08:03.046 --> 01:08:06.983 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT DEPP'S?

01:08:04.981 --> 01:08:08.184 region:rollup2
SO THE DATA EVEN IT TAX THE MEMO

01:08:06.983 --> 01:08:09.385 region:rollup2
SORT OF DID NOT WAS NOT

01:08:08.184 --> 01:08:11.220 region:rollup2
CONGRUENT.

01:08:09.385 --> 01:08:12.956 region:rollup2
WITHOUT WITH WHAT WAS DONE THAT

01:08:11.220 --> 01:08:13.923 region:rollup2
WAS SUBMITTED TO FOR FOR DID NOT

01:08:12.956 --> 01:08:15.391 region:rollup2
OBJECT TO IT.

01:08:13.923 --> 01:08:16.926 region:rollup2
AND IT WENT FORWARD THERE WAS

01:08:15.391 --> 01:08:18.461 region:rollup2
ANOTHER MEMO ISSUED IN TWO

01:08:16.926 --> 01:08:19.896 region:rollup2
THOUSAND NINE.

01:08:18.461 --> 01:08:21.564 region:rollup2
THAT WAS LOOKING AT THE

01:08:19.896 --> 01:08:24.067 region:rollup2
QUESTION HOW MUCH MATERIAL MIGHT

01:08:21.564 --> 01:08:25.802 region:rollup2
A ROAD INTO THE RIVER IF THE

01:08:24.067 --> 01:08:26.636 region:rollup2
EMERGENCY SPILLWAY OPERATED.

01:08:25.802 --> 01:08:29.038 region:rollup2
THAT ONE.

01:08:26.636 --> 01:08:30.473 region:rollup2
AGAIN CONCLUDED.

01:08:29.038 --> 01:08:32.375 region:rollup2
REFERENCE DO THOUSAND FIVE MEMO

01:08:30.473 --> 01:08:34.243 region:rollup2
AND CONCLUDED. THAT IT WOULD BE

01:08:32.375 --> 01:08:35.678 region:rollup2
THREE TO FOUR FEET OF SOIL AND

01:08:34.243 --> 01:08:36.613 region:rollup2
ROCK WITH A ROAD AND THEN WE HIT

01:08:35.678 --> 01:08:38.014 region:rollup2
NOT A RELIABLE MATERIAL ON IT

01:08:36.613 --> 01:08:40.583 region:rollup2
WOULD STOP.

01:08:38.014 --> 01:08:42.218 region:rollup2
BUT IT IN IT ALSO INCLUDED A

01:08:40.583 --> 01:08:43.886 region:rollup2
TABLE OF SEVERAL OF THESE DRILL

01:08:42.218 --> 01:08:45.688 region:rollup2
HOLES IN WITHIN THE TABLE ARE

01:08:43.886 --> 01:08:47.657 region:rollup2
NUMBERED DRILL HOLES THAT SHOW.

01:08:45.688 --> 01:08:49.325 region:rollup2
WHETHER PROCTOR GREATER DEPTH SO

01:08:47.657 --> 01:08:51.594 region:rollup2
DOES TO.

01:08:49.325 --> 01:08:52.729 region:rollup2
DESPITE HAVING DATA WITHIN THEM

01:08:51.594 --> 01:08:54.697 region:rollup2
REACH A CONCLUSION THAT IS A

01:08:52.729 --> 01:08:56.332 region:rollup2
LITTLE HARD TO SUPPORT.

01:08:54.697 --> 01:08:57.734 region:rollup2
WE DO TALK IN THE REPORT A BIT

01:08:56.332 --> 01:08:58.935 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE RISK BALLOTS IN THE

01:08:57.734 --> 01:09:00.136 region:rollup2
TRADE OFFS AND JUDGMENTS DURING

01:08:58.935 --> 01:09:01.971 region:rollup2
THE EVENT.

01:09:00.136 --> 01:09:03.406 region:rollup2
AND I WANT TO STRESS AGAIN AS AS

01:09:01.971 --> 01:09:05.608 region:rollup2
WE SAY IN THE REPORT.

01:09:03.406 --> 01:09:07.110 region:rollup2
ITSELF THAT WE'RE NOT TRYING TO

01:09:05.608 --> 01:09:08.678 region:rollup2
CRITICIZE THE DECISION MAKERS

01:09:07.110 --> 01:09:10.446 region:rollup2
I'VE AT LEAST THREE TIMES IN MY

01:09:08.678 --> 01:09:12.215 region:rollup2
CAREER I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN DAM

01:09:10.446 --> 01:09:13.783 region:rollup2
INCIDENTS IN EMERGENCIES.

01:09:12.215 --> 01:09:15.351 region:rollup2
AND I KNOW IT'S A SITUATION IT'S

01:09:13.783 --> 01:09:16.853 region:rollup2
A STRESSFUL SITUATION YOU HAVE A

01:09:15.351 --> 01:09:18.321 region:rollup2
LOT OF INFORMATION COMING AT YOU

01:09:16.853 --> 01:09:19.822 region:rollup2
FROM DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS. YOU

01:09:18.321 --> 01:09:21.858 region:rollup2
MAKE THE BEST JUDGMENT THAT YOU

01:09:19.822 --> 01:09:22.425 region:rollup2
CAN AT THE TIME AND I WAS

01:09:21.858 --> 01:09:25.428 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY ASK A QUESTION. ON

01:09:22.425 --> 01:09:27.296 region:rollup2
THIS.

01:09:25.428 --> 01:09:29.832 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD HE DO I KNOW FOR

01:09:27.296 --> 01:09:30.733 region:rollup2
CERTAIN THAT IF I WERE IN THAT

01:09:29.832 --> 01:09:32.602 region:rollup2
ROOM I WOULD HAVE MADE A

01:09:30.733 --> 01:09:34.103 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT DECISION TO USE THE

01:09:32.602 --> 01:09:35.338 region:rollup2
SPILLWAY MORE AND DON'T TAKE

01:09:34.103 --> 01:09:37.473 region:rollup2
LESS OF A CHANCE OF OPERATING

01:09:35.338 --> 01:09:38.408 region:rollup2
EMERGENCY SPILLWAY. AND I CAN'T

01:09:37.473 --> 01:09:39.542 region:rollup2
TELL YOU I WOULD DO THAT

01:09:38.408 --> 01:09:40.777 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I WASN'T IN THAT ROOM

01:09:39.542 --> 01:09:42.011 region:rollup2
AND YOU HAVE TO BE IN THE ROOM

01:09:40.777 --> 01:09:43.780 region:rollup2
TO REALLY KNOW THAT WE'RE TRYING

01:09:42.011 --> 01:09:45.181 region:rollup2
TO POINT OUT HERE. IS THAT WHEN

01:09:43.780 --> 01:09:46.949 region:rollup2
YOU LOOK AT THE INFORMATION

01:09:45.181 --> 01:09:48.251 region:rollup2
THERE WAS INFORMATION AVAILABLE

01:09:46.949 --> 01:09:49.619 region:rollup2
THAT MIGHT HAVE LED YOU TO A

01:09:48.251 --> 01:09:50.153 region:rollup2
REASONABLE TO A DIFFERENT

01:09:49.619 --> 01:09:52.055 region:rollup2
DECISION WITH A REASONABLE

01:09:50.153 --> 01:09:53.456 region:rollup2
BASIS.

01:09:52.055 --> 01:09:55.458 region:rollup2
TO THINK ABOUT THAT FOR THE

01:09:53.456 --> 01:09:56.626 region:rollup2
FUTURE AND HOW CAN WE PERHAPS

01:09:55.458 --> 01:09:59.228 region:rollup2
COMMUNICATE BETTER DURING THESE

01:09:56.626 --> 01:10:00.930 region:rollup2
THESE EMERGENCIES.

01:09:59.228 --> 01:10:02.632 region:rollup2
SO WITHOUT WHAT DID WE LEARN HOW

01:10:00.930 --> 01:10:04.967 region:rollup2
WE SUGGEST IN THE REPORT SOME

01:10:02.632 --> 01:10:06.836 region:rollup2
LESSONS TO BE LEARNED ABOUT FOR

01:10:04.967 --> 01:10:08.304 region:rollup2
SOME PRETTY W. ARE IN SOME FOR

01:10:06.836 --> 01:10:12.442 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY AS A WHOLE.

01:10:08.304 --> 01:10:13.976 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY FOR D. W. ARE.

01:10:12.442 --> 01:10:15.778 region:rollup2
I'M WE BELIEVED TO BE OUR NEEDS

01:10:13.976 --> 01:10:18.347 region:rollup2
TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON.

01:10:15.778 --> 01:10:19.982 region:rollup2
MATURING IT'S DAM SAFETY CULTURE

01:10:18.347 --> 01:10:22.218 region:rollup2
AND ORGANIZATION AND THEM CAN

01:10:19.982 --> 01:10:23.853 region:rollup2
IMPROVE THE PRIORITY WITHIN THE

01:10:22.218 --> 01:10:24.721 region:rollup2
W. ARE ON THE DAM SAFETY.

01:10:23.853 --> 01:10:27.690 region:rollup2
WE.

01:10:24.721 --> 01:10:29.158 region:rollup2
.

01:10:27.690 --> 01:10:31.260 region:rollup2
THE THE ORGANIZATION HAS A DAM

01:10:29.158 --> 01:10:32.595 region:rollup2
SAFETY PROGRAM WE ASK IN A

01:10:31.260 --> 01:10:34.997 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF OUR INTERVIEWS WHO IS

01:10:32.595 --> 01:10:36.432 region:rollup2
THE SENIOR EXECUTIVE AT GW R..

01:10:34.997 --> 01:10:38.134 region:rollup2
WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR DAM

01:10:36.432 --> 01:10:39.402 region:rollup2
SAFETY AND WE WOULD GET

01:10:38.134 --> 01:10:40.436 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT ANSWERS SO WHEN YOU

01:10:39.402 --> 01:10:41.704 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT ANSWERS THAT MEANS THE

01:10:40.436 --> 01:10:43.473 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONS A WHOLE DOESN'T

01:10:41.704 --> 01:10:45.508 region:rollup2
EXACTLY KNOW WHO THAT INDIVIDUAL

01:10:43.473 --> 01:10:46.409 region:rollup2
IS? SO THERE REALLY NEEDS TO BE

01:10:45.508 --> 01:10:47.777 region:rollup2
AN INDIVIDUAL THAT THE

01:10:46.409 --> 01:10:48.978 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATION KNOWS IS

01:10:47.777 --> 01:10:50.747 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT.

01:10:48.978 --> 01:10:52.381 region:rollup2
AND THAT INDIVIDUAL NEEDS TO BE

01:10:50.747 --> 01:10:54.050 region:rollup2
BRIEFED BY THE DAM SAFETY

01:10:52.381 --> 01:10:55.585 region:rollup2
PROFESSIONALS THE CHIEF DAM

01:10:54.050 --> 01:10:57.954 region:rollup2
SAFETY OFFICER ENGINEER IN THIS

01:10:55.585 --> 01:10:59.589 region:rollup2
CASE ON A REGULAR BASIS WHAT ARE

01:10:57.954 --> 01:11:03.292 region:rollup2
ISSUES WHAT SHOULD WE BE DOING.

01:10:59.589 --> 01:11:05.061 region:rollup2
pORGANIZATION HAS ONLY SO MUCH

01:11:03.292 --> 01:11:06.629 region:rollup2
MONEY AND HAS TO BALANCE ITS

01:11:05.061 --> 01:11:08.131 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT PRIORITIES OBJECTIVES

01:11:06.629 --> 01:11:09.766 region:rollup2
BUT TO BE SURE THE DAM SAFETY

01:11:08.131 --> 01:11:11.067 region:rollup2
GETS ITS APPROPRIATE.

01:11:09.766 --> 01:11:13.035 region:rollup2
VOICE IN THAT DECISION WHEN

01:11:11.067 --> 01:11:15.171 region:rollup2
THINGS ARE BEING MADE.

01:11:13.035 --> 01:11:16.706 region:rollup2
BOB WE'VE FEEL THERE WAS SOME

01:11:15.171 --> 01:11:18.441 region:rollup2
OVER CONFIDENCE AND COMPLACENCY.

01:11:16.706 --> 01:11:21.544 region:rollup2
THAT THE LEGEND IS THAT.

01:11:18.441 --> 01:11:24.647 region:rollup2
STATE WATER PROJECT WAS WAS WAS

01:11:21.544 --> 01:11:25.748 region:rollup2
BUILT A BEST BEST PRACTICES AT

01:11:24.647 --> 01:11:28.551 region:rollup2
THE TIME.

01:11:25.748 --> 01:11:30.553 region:rollup2
AND.

01:11:28.551 --> 01:11:30.553 region:rollup2
IT'S WAS THAT THERE'S LITTLE

01:11:30.620 --> 01:11:32.622 region:rollup2
THAT THAT THAT STUFF IS REALLY

01:11:31.654 --> 01:11:34.557 region:rollup2
GOOD INFRASTRUCTURE WE DON'T

01:11:32.622 --> 01:11:35.491 region:rollup2
NEED TO WORRY ABOUT IT WELL. NAY

01:11:34.557 --> 01:11:36.926 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO BE A BIT MORE

01:11:35.491 --> 01:11:37.493 region:rollup2
CRITICAL THAT MORE QUESTIONING

01:11:36.926 --> 01:11:38.327 region:rollup2
OF WORRY ABOUT A LITTLE BIT

01:11:37.493 --> 01:11:40.429 region:rollup2
MORE.

01:11:38.327 --> 01:11:41.397 region:rollup2
WE THINK THEY'D SOME NEED TO

01:11:40.429 --> 01:11:42.698 region:rollup2
ADDRESS INSULARITY IN THE

01:11:41.397 --> 01:11:44.066 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATION

01:11:42.698 --> 01:11:45.268 region:rollup2
A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE W. ARE

01:11:44.066 --> 01:11:46.903 region:rollup2
SPEND THEIR ENTIRE CAREERS

01:11:45.268 --> 01:11:48.104 region:rollup2
WITHIN ONE ORGANIZATION AND

01:11:46.903 --> 01:11:49.305 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT FUNDAMENTALLY PROBLEM

01:11:48.104 --> 01:11:50.673 region:rollup2
THERE OTHER ORGANIZATIONS THAT

01:11:49.305 --> 01:11:52.208 region:rollup2
DO THAT TOO. BUT YOU NEED TO

01:11:50.673 --> 01:11:53.209 region:rollup2
REACH OUT AND LEARN FROM WHAT

01:11:52.208 --> 01:11:54.577 region:rollup2
OTHER ORGANIZATIONS IN YOUR

01:11:53.209 --> 01:11:56.045 region:rollup2
BUSINESS OR DOING.

01:11:54.577 --> 01:11:57.113 region:rollup2
AND CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT

01:11:56.045 --> 01:11:59.015 region:rollup2
CREATES A BIT OF A CHALLENGE

01:11:57.113 --> 01:12:00.483 region:rollup2
WITH THAT FOR APPROVALS TO GO

01:11:59.015 --> 01:12:02.084 region:rollup2
OUT OF STATE FOR TRAINING AND.

01:12:00.483 --> 01:12:04.353 region:rollup2
AND CONFERENCES WHERE THAT

01:12:02.084 --> 01:12:05.421 region:rollup2
INFORMATION EXCHANGES SO.

01:12:04.353 --> 01:12:06.756 region:rollup2
IT PERHAPS LOOK TO YOU TO ARE

01:12:05.421 --> 01:12:08.724 region:rollup2
THERE WAYS THAT THERE COULD BE

01:12:06.756 --> 01:12:10.293 region:rollup2
RELIEF FOR THE FOR DWI TO BE

01:12:08.724 --> 01:12:11.427 region:rollup2
ABLE DO THAT MORE EASILY. AND

01:12:10.293 --> 01:12:12.862 region:rollup2
THEN DELIVERY ARE COULD ALSO

01:12:11.427 --> 01:12:14.163 region:rollup2
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF DISTANCE

01:12:12.862 --> 01:12:15.698 region:rollup2
LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES IN

01:12:14.163 --> 01:12:17.533 region:rollup2
PERHAPS BRINGING TRAINING IN THE

01:12:15.698 --> 01:12:19.335 region:rollup2
STATES WOULD REACH OUT AND LEARN

01:12:17.533 --> 01:12:21.571 region:rollup2
MORE WITH OUR BUSINESS IS DOING.

01:12:19.335 --> 01:12:23.072 region:rollup2
DWI NEEDS TO WORK TO BUILD A

01:12:21.571 --> 01:12:25.341 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE SIZE COMPOSITION

01:12:23.072 --> 01:12:27.310 region:rollup2
EXPERTISE OF TECHNICAL STAFF

01:12:25.341 --> 01:12:29.045 region:rollup2
INVOLVED IN DAM SAFETY. AND DAM

01:12:27.310 --> 01:12:30.479 region:rollup2
ENGINEERING AND AGAIN THAT MAY

01:12:29.045 --> 01:12:31.847 region:rollup2
BE SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN HELP

01:12:30.479 --> 01:12:33.216 region:rollup2
WITH BECAUSE.

01:12:31.847 --> 01:12:34.750 region:rollup2
BUT WE HEARD A LOT THAT THERE

01:12:33.216 --> 01:12:36.018 region:rollup2
ARE A LOT OF CONSTRAINTS ON D.

01:12:34.750 --> 01:12:38.254 region:rollup2
W. ARE HIRING NUMBERS OF

01:12:36.018 --> 01:12:39.822 region:rollup2
POSITIONS. AND AN ABILITY TO

01:12:38.254 --> 01:12:41.691 region:rollup2
ELEVATE PEOPLE TO SENIOR

01:12:39.822 --> 01:12:43.626 region:rollup2
POSITIONS AS TECHNICAL EXPERTS

01:12:41.691 --> 01:12:45.595 region:rollup2
NOT AS MANAGERS.

01:12:43.626 --> 01:12:46.262 region:rollup2
AND SOME HELP WITH THAT WITH

01:12:45.595 --> 01:12:48.731 region:rollup2
WITH THOSE BUREAUCRATIC

01:12:46.262 --> 01:12:50.132 region:rollup2
PROCESSES WOULD BE GOOD.

01:12:48.731 --> 01:12:51.667 region:rollup2
AND THEN ALSO ON EMPTY

01:12:50.132 --> 01:12:53.569 region:rollup2
INFORMATION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

01:12:51.667 --> 01:12:55.438 region:rollup2
COULD BE IMPROVED WEEKS WE HAD

01:12:53.569 --> 01:12:57.240 region:rollup2
STRUGGLED WITH FINDING

01:12:55.438 --> 01:12:59.175 region:rollup2
INFORMATION AND AND IF. DATA BR

01:12:57.240 --> 01:13:00.610 region:rollup2
COULD REALLY TAKE ON HOW CAN WE

01:12:59.175 --> 01:13:02.011 region:rollup2
HAVE A STATE OF THE PRACTICE.

01:13:00.610 --> 01:13:04.347 region:rollup2
INFORMATION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

01:13:02.011 --> 01:13:06.048 region:rollup2
FOR OUR DAM SAFETY INFORMATION.

01:13:04.347 --> 01:13:07.516 region:rollup2
OUR INDUSTRY ALSO HAS A LOT OF

01:13:06.048 --> 01:13:08.484 region:rollup2
LESSONS TO LEARN.

01:13:07.516 --> 01:13:10.853 region:rollup2
ONE BEING.

01:13:08.484 --> 01:13:12.655 region:rollup2
THE IMPORTANCE BECAUSE DWI R.

01:13:10.853 --> 01:13:14.323 region:rollup2
THESE RECOMMENDATIONS WE MADE TO

01:13:12.655 --> 01:13:16.492 region:rollup2
D. W. ARE IF I WERE GOING TO

01:13:14.323 --> 01:13:18.527 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF OTHER OR A

01:13:16.492 --> 01:13:18.995 region:rollup2
DANCE TONY ORGANIZATIONS I

01:13:18.527 --> 01:13:19.862 region:rollup2
PROBABLY MAKE THE SAME

01:13:18.995 --> 01:13:20.930 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATION.

01:13:19.862 --> 01:13:22.164 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT THE D. W. OURS AT THE

01:13:20.930 --> 01:13:23.099 region:rollup2
BOTTOM OF THE PACK THERE RIGHT

01:13:22.164 --> 01:13:24.767 region:rollup2
IN THE MIDDLE THERE A LOT OF

01:13:23.099 --> 01:13:26.636 region:rollup2
THEM. THERE LIKE THAT THERE ARE

01:13:24.767 --> 01:13:27.203 region:rollup2
SOME THAT ARE BETTER BUT THEY'RE

01:13:26.636 --> 01:13:28.037 region:rollup2
A LOT THERE RIGHT THERE WITH

01:13:27.203 --> 01:13:29.905 region:rollup2
THEM.

01:13:28.037 --> 01:13:31.474 region:rollup2
AND AND PART OF THAT IS THIS TOP

01:13:29.905 --> 01:13:33.943 region:rollup2
DOWN DAM SAFETY CULTURE THAT I

01:13:31.474 --> 01:13:35.544 region:rollup2
MENTIONED REALLY HAVE A SENIOR

01:13:33.943 --> 01:13:37.313 region:rollup2
EXECUTIVE RESPONSIBLE HAVE HIM.

01:13:35.544 --> 01:13:39.181 region:rollup2
GET THE PROPERTY INFORMATION.

01:13:37.313 --> 01:13:40.549 region:rollup2
OF PHYSICAL INSPECTIONS ARE DAM

01:13:39.181 --> 01:13:42.952 region:rollup2
SAFETY PROGRAM IN THE UNITED

01:13:40.549 --> 01:13:44.987 region:rollup2
STATES IS IN LARGE PART DRIVEN

01:13:42.952 --> 01:13:46.022 region:rollup2
BY GOING OUT ANNUALLY IN LOOKING

01:13:44.987 --> 01:13:47.623 region:rollup2
AT THAT THE DAM AND SEEING WE

01:13:46.022 --> 01:13:49.558 region:rollup2
SEE ANY ISSUES.

01:13:47.623 --> 01:13:50.726 region:rollup2
THE ISSUES HERE WERE UNDER THE

01:13:49.558 --> 01:13:51.794 region:rollup2
SLAB AND ONCE YOU HAVE DECIDED

01:13:50.726 --> 01:13:53.496 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:13:51.794 --> 01:13:55.264 region:rollup2
THE CRACKS IN THE DRAIN FLOWS

01:13:53.496 --> 01:13:57.233 region:rollup2
WERE NOT THEY WERE NORMAL THAT

01:13:55.264 --> 01:13:58.134 region:rollup2
THEY WERE NOT ABNORMAL PROBLEMS.

01:13:57.233 --> 01:13:59.769 region:rollup2
THERE VISUAL INSPECTION WOULD

01:13:58.134 --> 01:14:01.270 region:rollup2
YOU SHOW YOU ANYTHING YOU HAD TO

01:13:59.769 --> 01:14:02.838 region:rollup2
DO WHAT'S NEXT IN THE BULLET

01:14:01.270 --> 01:14:04.407 region:rollup2
THERE IS TO GO BACK AND DO A

01:14:02.838 --> 01:14:05.741 region:rollup2
COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW DIG INTO

01:14:04.407 --> 01:14:07.410 region:rollup2
THE DESIGN DIGGING TO THE

01:14:05.741 --> 01:14:09.211 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTION RECORDS. IDENTIFY

01:14:07.410 --> 01:14:11.147 region:rollup2
THOSE INHERENT DEFECTS THAT WERE

01:14:09.211 --> 01:14:14.183 region:rollup2
BUILT IN AT THE BEGINNING.

01:14:11.147 --> 01:14:15.084 region:rollup2
AND THEN. A WHAT CAN HAPPEN ON

01:14:14.183 --> 01:14:16.385 region:rollup2
A PROJECT LIKE OROVILLE YOU'VE

01:14:15.084 --> 01:14:18.287 region:rollup2
GOT A SEVEN HUNDRED SEVENTY FOOT

01:14:16.385 --> 01:14:20.256 region:rollup2
EMBANKMENT DAM. OVER THERE WHEN

01:14:18.287 --> 01:14:21.490 region:rollup2
YOU'RE DOING REVIEWS IT TENDS TO

01:14:20.256 --> 01:14:23.359 region:rollup2
DRAW A LOT OF ATTENTION.

01:14:21.490 --> 01:14:24.927 region:rollup2
AND PEOPLE CAN SOMETIMES FORGET

01:14:23.359 --> 01:14:26.529 region:rollup2
THESE APARTMENT FACILITIES LIKE

01:14:24.927 --> 01:14:28.097 region:rollup2
THE SPILLWAY THE OUTLET WORKS

01:14:26.529 --> 01:14:29.398 region:rollup2
THE POWER PLANT THEY DON'T GET

01:14:28.097 --> 01:14:30.967 region:rollup2
AS MUCH ATTENTION BECAUSE THAT

01:14:29.398 --> 01:14:33.102 region:rollup2
REALLY BIG ELEPHANT THE ROOM.

01:14:30.967 --> 01:14:34.236 region:rollup2
GETS THE ATTENTION SO WE NEED

01:14:33.102 --> 01:14:35.404 region:rollup2
THAT TO THINK ABOUT THAT AND

01:14:34.236 --> 01:14:35.871 region:rollup2
HAVE THAT ATTENTION BY THE

01:14:35.404 --> 01:14:37.340 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WITH THE RIGHT

01:14:35.871 --> 01:14:38.874 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE.

01:14:37.340 --> 01:14:40.476 region:rollup2
WE HAVE A PROCESS CALLED THE

01:14:38.874 --> 01:14:42.178 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL FAILURE MODES ANALYSIS

01:14:40.476 --> 01:14:44.613 region:rollup2
A PROCEDURE THAT USED TO LIVE IN

01:14:42.178 --> 01:14:46.048 region:rollup2
DAM SAFETY AND I WANT.

01:14:44.613 --> 01:14:46.916 region:rollup2
I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH YOU KNOW

01:14:46.048 --> 01:14:48.517 region:rollup2
ABOUT THAT UP HAPPY TO ANSWER

01:14:46.916 --> 01:14:49.585 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS IF YOU WANNA KNOW MORE

01:14:48.517 --> 01:14:50.786 region:rollup2
BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

01:14:49.585 --> 01:14:52.254 region:rollup2
HAPPENS WITH IT IT WAS DONE AT

01:14:50.786 --> 01:14:53.322 region:rollup2
ORACLE. BUT IT FOCUSES ON THE

01:14:52.254 --> 01:14:54.223 region:rollup2
RISK

01:14:53.322 --> 01:14:56.359 region:rollup2
OF HAVING RESERVOIR WATER

01:14:54.223 --> 01:14:57.994 region:rollup2
RELEASED.

01:14:56.359 --> 01:14:59.362 region:rollup2
SO IF YOU GET TO A POINT LIKE AT

01:14:57.994 --> 01:15:00.930 region:rollup2
THE SERVICE BILL WAY.

01:14:59.362 --> 01:15:02.865 region:rollup2
WHEN THEY DID THIS THEY

01:15:00.930 --> 01:15:04.400 region:rollup2
CONCLUDED THAT THE ROCK THE

01:15:02.865 --> 01:15:05.835 region:rollup2
SERVICE SPILLWAY WAS SUCH THAT

01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:07.636 region:rollup2
EVEN IF EROSION HAPPENED EVEN IF

01:15:05.835 --> 01:15:09.405 region:rollup2
THE SLAB.

01:15:07.636 --> 01:15:10.806 region:rollup2
WITH FAILED THE EROSION

01:15:09.405 --> 01:15:12.575 region:rollup2
WOULDN'T GO BACK UP TO THE GATE

01:15:10.806 --> 01:15:14.110 region:rollup2
STRUCTURE WOULDN'T RELEASE THE

01:15:12.575 --> 01:15:15.378 region:rollup2
STORAGE SO THEY STOPPED IT LOOK

01:15:14.110 --> 01:15:16.645 region:rollup2
ANY FURTHER AND. WELL THEIR RISK

01:15:15.378 --> 01:15:18.147 region:rollup2
AS.

01:15:16.645 --> 01:15:19.749 region:rollup2
PROS BY THIS INCIDENT AND AS

01:15:18.147 --> 01:15:21.684 region:rollup2
DISCUSSED EARLIER TODAY WITH

01:15:19.749 --> 01:15:22.818 region:rollup2
THESE POWER LINES HIM DOWNSTREAM

01:15:21.684 --> 01:15:24.286 region:rollup2
OF THE MERCY SPILLWAY THAT IN

01:15:22.818 --> 01:15:26.389 region:rollup2
OUR CURRENT USE THE PROCESS

01:15:24.286 --> 01:15:27.123 region:rollup2
DON'T COME OUT.

01:15:26.389 --> 01:15:27.923 region:rollup2
AND PROBABLY NEW NEED TO COME

01:15:27.123 --> 01:15:28.824 region:rollup2
OUT.

01:15:27.923 --> 01:15:30.359 region:rollup2
AND THEN.

01:15:28.824 --> 01:15:32.495 region:rollup2
THE LAST ONE THERE FOR OUR

01:15:30.359 --> 01:15:33.662 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY IS OWNERS OFTEN THINK

01:15:32.495 --> 01:15:35.331 region:rollup2
THAT IF THEY DO WHAT THE DIRECT

01:15:33.662 --> 01:15:35.831 region:rollup2
WHAT THE REGULAR TELLS THEM TO

01:15:35.331 --> 01:15:37.166 region:rollup2
DO ALL OF THEIR RISK ARE

01:15:35.831 --> 01:15:39.034 region:rollup2
DRESSED.

01:15:37.166 --> 01:15:39.668 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY TRUE

01:15:39.034 --> 01:15:42.204 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THROUGH IT REGULATORS

01:15:39.668 --> 01:15:43.672 region:rollup2
AGAIN OFTEN ARE FOCUSED ON. THIS

01:15:42.204 --> 01:15:46.142 region:rollup2
RELEASE OF RESERVOIR AND NOT

01:15:43.672 --> 01:15:47.910 region:rollup2
THESE OTHER NON RELEASE.

01:15:46.142 --> 01:15:49.879 region:rollup2
INCIDENT SO THAT'S WHAT OUR

01:15:47.910 --> 01:15:52.748 region:rollup2
REPORT HAD TO SAY AND IN SHORT

01:15:49.879 --> 01:15:55.217 region:rollup2
AND UP BE HAPPY TO. ENTERTAIN

01:15:52.748 --> 01:15:57.653 region:rollup2
ANY QUESTIONS OR DISCUSSION ON.

01:15:55.217 --> 01:16:00.523 region:rollup2
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I'M JUST

01:15:57.653 --> 01:16:02.057 region:rollup2
START ONE OF A START UP BY AM.

01:16:00.523 --> 01:16:05.261 region:rollup2
THINKING IT PW R..

01:16:02.057 --> 01:16:05.828 region:rollup2
I KNOW IT'S IT IT'S BEEN AT

01:16:05.261 --> 01:16:07.029 region:rollup2
LEAST INCREDIBLY STRESSFUL

01:16:05.828 --> 01:16:08.464 region:rollup2
SITUATION TO HAVE THE WHOLE

01:16:07.029 --> 01:16:11.200 region:rollup2
STATE EYES ON YOU.

01:16:08.464 --> 01:16:12.501 region:rollup2
AND HAVING YOUR YOUR WHOLE AND

01:16:11.200 --> 01:16:15.037 region:rollup2
DIVISION EVERYONE EVERYONE'S

01:16:12.501 --> 01:16:16.839 region:rollup2
EYES ARE ON THAT RIGHT. THEM.

01:16:15.037 --> 01:16:18.607 region:rollup2
SO I THINK IT IS IT IS A. IT IS

01:16:16.839 --> 01:16:19.208 region:rollup2
NATURAL

01:16:18.607 --> 01:16:20.676 region:rollup2
I FEEL.

01:16:19.208 --> 01:16:22.511 region:rollup2
DEFENSIVE IT UNDER THE

01:16:20.676 --> 01:16:24.246 region:rollup2
MICROSCOPE BECAUSE YOU ARE RIGHT

01:16:22.511 --> 01:16:25.815 region:rollup2
YOU ARE IN EVERYBODY'S WATCHING.

01:16:24.246 --> 01:16:27.817 region:rollup2
AND I ALSO UNDERSTAND THE

01:16:25.815 --> 01:16:29.618 region:rollup2
CONTEXT IN WHICH IT OCCURRED

01:16:27.817 --> 01:16:31.821 region:rollup2
THAT THE ABUSES MILLIONS OF

01:16:29.618 --> 01:16:33.789 region:rollup2
ACRES FEET OF WATER A MASSIVE

01:16:31.821 --> 01:16:36.158 region:rollup2
AMOUNT OF WATER THAT WE HOLD TO.

01:16:33.789 --> 01:16:38.527 region:rollup2
TO TRANSFER ACROSS THE STATE.

01:16:36.158 --> 01:16:39.095 region:rollup2
THEN AND IT BRAIN AWAY MORE

01:16:38.527 --> 01:16:40.129 region:rollup2
THAN ANYBODY THOUGHT IT WAS

01:16:39.095 --> 01:16:41.864 region:rollup2
GOING TO WRITE SO THE CONTEXT

01:16:40.129 --> 01:16:42.264 region:rollup2
WAS.

01:16:41.864 --> 01:16:45.234 region:rollup2
AND THAT HAPPENED.

01:16:42.264 --> 01:16:46.735 region:rollup2
.

01:16:45.234 --> 01:16:50.506 region:rollup2
BUT AS WE AS GOING FORWARD AND

01:16:46.735 --> 01:16:52.174 region:rollup2
TO MR FRANCE.

01:16:50.506 --> 01:16:54.577 region:rollup2
JUST WANTED ENGINEER SOCIAL

01:16:52.174 --> 01:16:55.911 region:rollup2
WORKER RIGHTS AYE I START DOING

01:16:54.577 --> 01:16:57.980 region:rollup2
ANALOGIES IN MY HEAD OF. LONG

01:16:55.911 --> 01:16:58.481 region:rollup2
TERM RELATIONSHIPS

01:16:57.980 --> 01:16:59.882 region:rollup2
RATES WE GET MARRIED THE

01:16:58.481 --> 01:17:00.749 region:rollup2
SIXTIES%

01:16:59.882 --> 01:17:01.917 region:rollup2
THAT YOU THOUGHT IT WAS A REAL

01:17:00.749 --> 01:17:03.385 region:rollup2
FIRM FOUNDATION AND AS THEY GO

01:17:01.917 --> 01:17:04.420 region:rollup2
ON.

01:17:03.385 --> 01:17:05.054 region:rollup2
THINGS STILL SHAKY TO GET

01:17:04.420 --> 01:17:06.489 region:rollup2
COMPLACENT AND THEN A BIG CRISIS

01:17:05.054 --> 01:17:07.423 region:rollup2
OCCURS.

01:17:06.489 --> 01:17:08.958 region:rollup2
AND THE RELATIONSHIP BEGINS TO

01:17:07.423 --> 01:17:10.759 region:rollup2
CRUMBLE AND YOU THINK YOU KNOW

01:17:08.958 --> 01:17:11.727 region:rollup2
HOW. SO IN A RELATIONSHIP WHO

01:17:10.759 --> 01:17:13.629 region:rollup2
SCUTTLED BACK HOW HOW COULD WE

01:17:11.727 --> 01:17:15.197 region:rollup2
HAVE SEEN THIS.

01:17:13.629 --> 01:17:16.599 region:rollup2
AND I KNOW YOU HAD ALL THE THE

01:17:15.197 --> 01:17:17.666 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTIONS AND EVERYTHING

01:17:16.599 --> 01:17:19.001 region:rollup2
GOING ON AND I UNDERSTAND IT

01:17:17.666 --> 01:17:19.702 region:rollup2
SOUNDS LIKE AND HAPPENS IN

01:17:19.001 --> 01:17:21.937 region:rollup2
BUREAUCRACIES IN ANY

01:17:19.702 --> 01:17:24.440 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATION. COMPLACENCY OCCURS

01:17:21.937 --> 01:17:25.274 region:rollup2
AS A DOZEN RELATIONSHIPS.

01:17:24.440 --> 01:17:27.309 region:rollup2
WHAT COULD HAVE MINK SO NOW

01:17:25.274 --> 01:17:29.278 region:rollup2
YOU'VE DONE A FORENSIC?

01:17:27.309 --> 01:17:31.113 region:rollup2
REPORT IT ARE THERE MORE KIND OF

01:17:29.278 --> 01:17:32.481 region:rollup2
ONGOING FORENSIC. INSPECTIONS

01:17:31.113 --> 01:17:35.150 region:rollup2
THAT CAN OCCUR DUE TO HAVE BEEN

01:17:32.481 --> 01:17:36.552 region:rollup2
ABLE TO CATCH THIS. EARLIER

01:17:35.150 --> 01:17:37.887 region:rollup2
BECAUSE ALSO YOU WANT THROUGH

01:17:36.552 --> 01:17:39.255 region:rollup2
THE RELATIONSHIP AWAY RIGHT AND

01:17:37.887 --> 01:17:40.589 region:rollup2
I KNOW I MEAN TO BE IT TO THAT

01:17:39.255 --> 01:17:42.258 region:rollup2
THE AMOUNT OF REPAIRS THAT

01:17:40.589 --> 01:17:47.530 region:rollup2
HAPPEN TO GO DOWN TO REACH

01:17:42.258 --> 01:17:48.831 region:rollup2
BEDROCK. WAS ENCRYPT IT YOU KNOW

01:17:47.530 --> 01:17:49.965 region:rollup2
AND AN INCREDIBLE HOW COULD THAT

01:17:48.831 --> 01:17:51.200 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN DONE WHILE THE DAM WAS

01:17:49.965 --> 01:17:53.502 region:rollup2
OPERATING WITHOUT THIS CRISIS

01:17:51.200 --> 01:17:55.371 region:rollup2
OCCURRING.

01:17:53.502 --> 01:17:58.374 region:rollup2
IT'S A FACT I LIKE THE ANALOGY

01:17:55.371 --> 01:17:59.041 region:rollup2
OF THE THE MARRIAGE SENSE NOT OF

01:17:58.374 --> 01:18:01.644 region:rollup2
THAT ONE BEFORE BUT I LIKE THAT.

01:17:59.041 --> 01:18:02.645 region:rollup2
.

01:18:01.644 --> 01:18:03.846 region:rollup2
THE THE THE THING THAT WOULD

01:18:02.645 --> 01:18:04.780 region:rollup2
HAVE POINTED OUT IN AND THE TWO

01:18:03.846 --> 01:18:06.215 region:rollup2
THOUSAND FOURTEEN PFM A ALMOST

01:18:04.780 --> 01:18:07.750 region:rollup2
GOT THERE.

01:18:06.215 --> 01:18:09.051 region:rollup2
THEY FOR THE THE ISSUE AT THE

01:18:07.750 --> 01:18:09.885 region:rollup2
SERVICE BILL WAY THEY IDENTIFIED

01:18:09.051 --> 01:18:12.221 region:rollup2
THE PARTICULAR FAILURE MODE THAT

01:18:09.885 --> 01:18:14.523 region:rollup2
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. BUT BECAUSE

01:18:12.221 --> 01:18:15.991 region:rollup2
THE FOCUS WAS ON ONE WOULD IT

01:18:14.523 --> 01:18:17.927 region:rollup2
RELEASED THE RESERVOIR OR NOT.

01:18:15.991 --> 01:18:19.795 region:rollup2
OF ONCE THEY FELT THE GEOLOGY

01:18:17.927 --> 01:18:21.463 region:rollup2
WAS WAS.

01:18:19.795 --> 01:18:22.898 region:rollup2
SUCH THAT IT WOULD NOT REACH

01:18:21.463 --> 01:18:24.066 region:rollup2
THE RESERVOIR.

01:18:22.898 --> 01:18:25.134 region:rollup2
THE FAILURE MODE WASN'T

01:18:24.066 --> 01:18:26.435 region:rollup2
CONSIDERED ANY FURTHER AND IN

01:18:25.134 --> 01:18:27.703 region:rollup2
RETROSPECT IT MAY OF BEEN A

01:18:26.435 --> 01:18:29.071 region:rollup2
CORRECT CONCLUSION BECAUSE IN

01:18:27.703 --> 01:18:30.406 region:rollup2
RETROSPECT. YOU PUT A HUNDRED

01:18:29.071 --> 01:18:32.341 region:rollup2
THOUSAND CFS THROUGH THAT

01:18:30.406 --> 01:18:34.376 region:rollup2
STRUCTURE AFTER THE MERGE THE

01:18:32.341 --> 01:18:35.811 region:rollup2
SPILLWAY ISSUE DEVELOPED ANY

01:18:34.376 --> 01:18:37.212 region:rollup2
DIDN'T PROGRESS BACK TOWARDS THE

01:18:35.811 --> 01:18:38.781 region:rollup2
TO SO THAT WAS PROBABLY CORRECT

01:18:37.212 --> 01:18:39.582 region:rollup2
INCLUSION ACTUALLY.

01:18:38.781 --> 01:18:41.217 region:rollup2
BUT.

01:18:39.582 --> 01:18:42.551 region:rollup2
THAT'S WERE REPORTING IT TO THE

01:18:41.217 --> 01:18:45.020 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY AS WE NEED TO STEP BACK

01:18:42.551 --> 01:18:47.222 region:rollup2
AND REALIZE. THAT THERE THERE

01:18:45.020 --> 01:18:49.458 region:rollup2
ARE OTHER THINGS THAT.

01:18:47.222 --> 01:18:51.226 region:rollup2
WE WE TALK ABOUT OUR REPORTS

01:18:49.458 --> 01:18:52.962 region:rollup2
COMPONENT FAILURES WOULD THINK

01:18:51.226 --> 01:18:53.462 region:rollup2
OF THIS SHOOT THE SHOOTER IS A

01:18:52.962 --> 01:18:54.930 region:rollup2
COMPOUND IN THE OVERALL

01:18:53.462 --> 01:18:56.632 region:rollup2
STRUCTURE.

01:18:54.930 --> 01:18:58.567 region:rollup2
AND THIS SHOOT FAILED IS YOU

01:18:56.632 --> 01:18:59.868 region:rollup2
CAN'T.

01:18:58.567 --> 01:19:01.170 region:rollup2
TAKE THAT WORD AWAY I HAVE THIS

01:18:59.868 --> 01:19:03.005 region:rollup2
IS NOT A DAMN FAILURE BECAUSE

01:19:01.170 --> 01:19:04.573 region:rollup2
THE RESERVOIR WAS RELEASED BUT

01:19:03.005 --> 01:19:06.575 region:rollup2
THE SHOOT FAIR. AND THAT

01:19:04.573 --> 01:19:08.143 region:rollup2
COMPONENT FAILURE THEN LED TO D.

01:19:06.575 --> 01:19:09.712 region:rollup2
W. ARE NOT BEING ABLE TO CONTROL

01:19:08.143 --> 01:19:11.080 region:rollup2
THE REST OF WAR THE WAY IT WOULD

01:19:09.712 --> 01:19:12.548 region:rollup2
LIKE TO CONTROL THE REDS WERE IT

01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:14.383 region:rollup2
LED TO ALL THAT. THE BRISK TRADE

01:19:12.548 --> 01:19:15.150 region:rollup2
OFFS AND LED ULTIMATELY TO THE

01:19:14.383 --> 01:19:17.920 region:rollup2
WATER GOING OVER THE EMERGENCY

01:19:15.150 --> 01:19:19.521 region:rollup2
SPILLWAY. SO WE NEED TO AS A AS

01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:21.824 region:rollup2
A DAM SAFETY PRACTICE OR STEP

01:19:19.521 --> 01:19:23.325 region:rollup2
BACK AND REALIZE THAT. WE WE

01:19:21.824 --> 01:19:26.395 region:rollup2
NEED TO SOMEHOW FIND A WAY TO

01:19:23.325 --> 01:19:28.998 region:rollup2
IDENTIFY THOSE MORE SERIOUS.

01:19:26.395 --> 01:19:29.898 region:rollup2
NINE RELEASE FAILURE MODES THAT

01:19:28.998 --> 01:19:32.601 region:rollup2
THAT AN OWNER NEEDS TO THINK

01:19:29.898 --> 01:19:34.737 region:rollup2
ABOUT. AND AND IF THE REGULATORS

01:19:32.601 --> 01:19:35.638 region:rollup2
OF IT WE HAVE A VERY COMPLEX

01:19:34.737 --> 01:19:36.939 region:rollup2
REGULATORY SYSTEM IN THE UNITED

01:19:35.638 --> 01:19:40.009 region:rollup2
STATES.

01:19:36.939 --> 01:19:41.243 region:rollup2
WE HAVE THE THE THE FEDERAL DAM

01:19:40.009 --> 01:19:42.911 region:rollup2
OWNERS PUREXML MISSION COURT

01:19:41.243 --> 01:19:44.613 region:rollup2
ENGINEERS REGULATE THEMSELVES.

01:19:42.911 --> 01:19:47.082 region:rollup2
THE FEDERAL YOU REGULATORY

01:19:44.613 --> 01:19:48.584 region:rollup2
COMMISSION FOR. REGULATES THE

01:19:47.082 --> 01:19:49.518 region:rollup2
HYDRO POWER GENERATING DAMS

01:19:48.584 --> 01:19:51.587 region:rollup2
ALL THE REST OF THEM ARE

01:19:49.518 --> 01:19:52.321 region:rollup2
REGULATED BY THE STATES.

01:19:51.587 --> 01:19:52.888 region:rollup2
AND ALL THE STATE'S ARE

01:19:52.321 --> 01:19:55.157 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT.

01:19:52.888 --> 01:19:55.924 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA'S FORTUNATE THAT

01:19:55.157 --> 01:19:57.793 region:rollup2
REALLY HAVE IF YOU STATE IS A

01:19:55.924 --> 01:19:59.762 region:rollup2
GOOD PROGRAM IT HAS BEEN A GOOD

01:19:57.793 --> 01:20:01.297 region:rollup2
PROGRAM. AND I'M CONFIDENT WILL

01:19:59.762 --> 01:20:02.231 region:rollup2
LEARN FROM THIS INCIDENT WILL BE

01:20:01.297 --> 01:20:02.431 region:rollup2
AN EVEN BETTER PROGRAM.

01:20:02.231 --> 01:20:04.133 region:rollup2
BUT.

01:20:02.431 --> 01:20:06.969 region:rollup2
.

01:20:04.133 --> 01:20:08.804 region:rollup2
THOSE PROGRAMS HAVE AS WE SAY

01:20:06.969 --> 01:20:10.673 region:rollup2
HERE BEEN DRIVEN BY THE PHYSICAL

01:20:08.804 --> 01:20:11.240 region:rollup2
INSPECTIONS WHICH IN THIS CASE

01:20:10.673 --> 01:20:12.675 region:rollup2
WOULD NOT HAVE INDICATED THE

01:20:11.240 --> 01:20:13.342 region:rollup2
PROBLEM.

01:20:12.675 --> 01:20:14.209 region:rollup2
AND.

01:20:13.342 --> 01:20:16.412 region:rollup2
THE.

01:20:14.209 --> 01:20:17.980 region:rollup2
THEY'VE BEEN DRIVEN BYBOTH

01:20:16.412 --> 01:20:18.881 region:rollup2
THAT AND THEN OCCASIONALLY AN

01:20:17.980 --> 01:20:20.482 region:rollup2
INCIDENT THAT LEADS IN TO DO

01:20:18.881 --> 01:20:22.518 region:rollup2
SOMETHING DIFFERENT FOR MEMBER

01:20:20.482 --> 01:20:24.119 region:rollup2
BACK TO. OF FOLSOM DAM HEN THE

01:20:22.518 --> 01:20:24.887 region:rollup2
GATES FAILED CALIFORNIA THEN

01:20:24.119 --> 01:20:25.988 region:rollup2
WENT OUT AND LOOKED AT ALL THE

01:20:24.887 --> 01:20:27.756 region:rollup2
THE GATES AS IT DID OTHER

01:20:25.988 --> 01:20:30.225 region:rollup2
REGULATORS SO WHAT WE'RE SAYING

01:20:27.756 --> 01:20:32.227 region:rollup2
IS WE REALLY NEED TO DO NOW STEP

01:20:30.225 --> 01:20:33.395 region:rollup2
BACK AND POLICE WITH CITIES FIND

01:20:32.227 --> 01:20:35.230 region:rollup2
AWAY IN WITH THAT THAT'S.

01:20:33.395 --> 01:20:36.865 region:rollup2
MORE RESOURCES OR ALLOCATING THE

01:20:35.230 --> 01:20:39.435 region:rollup2
RESOURCES WE HAVE IN A DIFFERENT

01:20:36.865 --> 01:20:42.204 region:rollup2
WAY TO DO THESE LOOK BACKS AT

01:20:39.435 --> 01:20:43.105 region:rollup2
WHAT WAS DESIGNED AND BUILT. HOW

01:20:42.204 --> 01:20:44.940 region:rollup2
DOES IT LOOK IN THE WHAT WE

01:20:43.105 --> 01:20:46.108 region:rollup2
SUGGESTED HERE'S THE QUESTION

01:20:44.940 --> 01:20:47.576 region:rollup2
YOU'RE ASKING IS YOU LOOK AT?

01:20:46.108 --> 01:20:48.877 region:rollup2
HOW WAS IT DESIGNED AND BUILT

01:20:47.576 --> 01:20:49.812 region:rollup2
HOW DOES THAT COMPARE TO THE WAY

01:20:48.877 --> 01:20:51.346 region:rollup2
WE WOULD DESIGN AND BUILD IT

01:20:49.812 --> 01:20:53.816 region:rollup2
TODAY?

01:20:51.346 --> 01:20:54.983 region:rollup2
AND. IF IT IS DIFFERENT DO THE

01:20:53.816 --> 01:20:56.885 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCES BUT HAS LIKE

01:20:54.983 --> 01:20:58.087 region:rollup2
COMPROMISE THE STRUCTURE.

01:20:56.885 --> 01:20:59.621 region:rollup2
AND IF THEY DO THEN YOU NEED TO

01:20:58.087 --> 01:21:01.657 region:rollup2
TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT IF YOU

01:20:59.621 --> 01:21:02.624 region:rollup2
DON'T KNOW THEN YOU NEED TO DO

01:21:01.657 --> 01:21:03.392 region:rollup2
FURTHER INVESTIGATIONS INTO YOU

01:21:02.624 --> 01:21:05.494 region:rollup2
DO NOW.

01:21:03.392 --> 01:21:07.396 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S THE.

01:21:05.494 --> 01:21:08.364 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE BIG TAKEAWAY FOR OUR

01:21:07.396 --> 01:21:09.565 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY IS WE'RE NOT DOING THAT

01:21:08.364 --> 01:21:10.933 region:rollup2
NOW. AND IF WE'RE NOT THAT WE

01:21:09.565 --> 01:21:11.967 region:rollup2
DON'T DO THAT

01:21:10.933 --> 01:21:13.235 region:rollup2
THERE WILL BE THINGS LIKE THIS

01:21:11.967 --> 01:21:14.403 region:rollup2
THAT WILL HAPPEN AGAIN IN THE

01:21:13.235 --> 01:21:15.304 region:rollup2
NEXT TIME IT MIGHT NOT BE A

01:21:14.403 --> 01:21:16.739 region:rollup2
SPILLWAYS MAYBE SOMETHING ELSE

01:21:15.304 --> 01:21:18.440 region:rollup2
OF THE.

01:21:16.739 --> 01:21:20.709 region:rollup2
THE LESSON DOESN'T APPLY JUST TO

01:21:18.440 --> 01:21:21.176 region:rollup2
SPILLWAYS IT APPLIES TO THE DAM

01:21:20.709 --> 01:21:23.846 region:rollup2

THE DIFFERENT. AGENCIES ARE THE

01:22:06.221 --> 01:22:09.458 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT.

01:22:06.522 --> 01:22:10.025 region:rollup2
DIVISIONS OF THE DEPARTMENT TO

01:22:09.458 --> 01:22:14.897 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE THAT THAT DOESN'T

01:22:10.025 --> 01:22:17.432 region:rollup2

ACNE THING SO THANK YOU FOR THE

01:22:19.735 --> 01:22:23.472 region:rollup2
QUESTION.

01:22:20.135 --> 01:22:24.773 region:rollup2
THE YEAH I THINK THAT.

01:22:23.472 --> 01:22:26.508 region:rollup2
.

01:22:24.773 --> 01:22:28.844 region:rollup2
WE'VE ALREADY TAKEN SOME STEPS

01:22:26.508 --> 01:22:29.711 region:rollup2
OVER THIS LAST YEAR TO IMPROVE

01:22:28.844 --> 01:22:31.880 region:rollup2
COMMUNICATIONS AND ALL RUN

01:22:29.711 --> 01:22:33.882 region:rollup2
THROUGH A FEW OF THOSE. I THINK

01:22:31.880 --> 01:22:35.217 region:rollup2
THE REPORT THAT THE ROAD

01:22:33.882 --> 01:22:35.717 region:rollup2
INDEPENDENT FORENSIC TEAMS PUT

01:22:35.217 --> 01:22:38.720 region:rollup2
OUT GIVES US SOME GOOD

01:22:35.717 --> 01:22:40.255 region:rollup2
GUIDELINES AS TO WHAT.

01:22:38.720 --> 01:22:41.256 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE FOLKS MAYBE WERE

01:22:40.255 --> 01:22:42.491 region:rollup2
THINKING THAT THEY INTERVIEWED

01:22:41.256 --> 01:22:45.227 region:rollup2
OR WHERE THERE WERE GAPS IN

01:22:42.491 --> 01:22:47.196 region:rollup2
INFORMATION THAT WE CAN.

01:22:45.227 --> 01:22:47.796 region:rollup2
I MOVE FORWARD TO FILL AND. SO

01:22:47.196 --> 01:22:48.864 region:rollup2
PART OF IT.

01:22:47.796 --> 01:22:49.865 region:rollup2
IS

01:22:48.864 --> 01:22:51.967 region:rollup2
I THINK CLEARLY IDENTIFYING WE

01:22:49.865 --> 01:22:54.937 region:rollup2
DO HAVE EXECUTIVE LEVEL POINT.

01:22:51.967 --> 01:22:56.505 region:rollup2
PEOPLE FOR THE VARIOUS FACETS OF

01:22:54.937 --> 01:22:57.139 region:rollup2
DAM SAFETY IN THE DEPARTMENT AND

01:22:56.505 --> 01:22:57.906 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE THINGS TO REMEMBER AS

01:22:57.139 --> 01:23:00.576 region:rollup2
WE HAVE.

01:22:57.906 --> 01:23:01.910 region:rollup2
MULTIPLE FACETS OF BROWN'S

01:23:00.576 --> 01:23:04.246 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE DAM SAFETY SO I

01:23:01.910 --> 01:23:05.914 region:rollup2
THINK IT'S MAKING SURE THAT.

01:23:04.246 --> 01:23:07.082 region:rollup2
IT ALL OVER FOLKS UNDERSTAND

01:23:05.914 --> 01:23:09.117 region:rollup2
THAT TOLL AS THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR

01:23:07.082 --> 01:23:11.019 region:rollup2
FOR THE STATE WATER PROJECT IS

01:23:09.117 --> 01:23:12.688 region:rollup2
THE DAM OWNER SO FROM THAT SIDE

01:23:11.019 --> 01:23:14.089 region:rollup2
OF DWI ARE. ULTIMATELY THOUGH HE

01:23:12.688 --> 01:23:17.693 region:rollup2
HAS MULTIPLE DIVISIONS UNDER HIM

01:23:14.089 --> 01:23:18.894 region:rollup2
THAT YOU KNOW DEAL WITH THAT.

01:23:17.693 --> 01:23:21.363 region:rollup2
OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE AND

01:23:18.894 --> 01:23:23.031 region:rollup2
ENGINEERING ULTIMATELY HE IS

01:23:21.363 --> 01:23:23.966 region:rollup2
THE THE HEAD OF THAT.

01:23:23.031 --> 01:23:25.801 region:rollup2
PART OF THE WITHIN THE

01:23:23.966 --> 01:23:27.069 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT AND ALL THE DECISIONS

01:23:25.801 --> 01:23:29.204 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW BANNER RECOMMENDATIONS

01:23:27.069 --> 01:23:30.172 region:rollup2
COME UP THROUGH HIM AND HE IS

01:23:29.204 --> 01:23:31.507 region:rollup2
HOUSED THEM FINAL SAY ON THAT SO

01:23:30.172 --> 01:23:32.941 region:rollup2
MAKING SURE THAT.

01:23:31.507 --> 01:23:34.743 region:rollup2
AS A DIEM OWNER EVERYONE

01:23:32.941 --> 01:23:36.879 region:rollup2
INTERNALLY KNOWS THAT'S JEWEL IN

01:23:34.743 --> 01:23:40.015 region:rollup2
HIS ROLE WE ALSO HAVE OUR

01:23:36.879 --> 01:23:41.950 region:rollup2
REGULATORY ARM THE DIVISION OR.

01:23:40.015 --> 01:23:42.951 region:rollup2
SAFETY OF DAMS AND WE HAVE ERA

01:23:41.950 --> 01:23:43.485 region:rollup2
COKE IS GONNA BE PART OF THE

01:23:42.951 --> 01:23:46.388 region:rollup2
NEXT PANEL IS OUR DEPUTY

01:23:43.485 --> 01:23:47.422 region:rollup2
DIRECTOR FOR THAT PIECE. HAS

01:23:46.388 --> 01:23:48.891 region:rollup2
WHEELS ARE CHIEF ENGINEER

01:23:47.422 --> 01:23:50.092 region:rollup2
SHARING TAPIO SO.

01:23:48.891 --> 01:23:51.193 region:rollup2
PEOPLE ARE IN PLACE BUT

01:23:50.092 --> 01:23:52.327 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU DO WE

01:23:51.193 --> 01:23:52.861 region:rollup2
NEED TO MAKE SURE EVERYBODY.

01:23:52.327 --> 01:23:53.662 region:rollup2
THROUGHOUT THE DEPARTMENT

01:23:52.861 --> 01:23:54.863 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDS

01:23:53.662 --> 01:23:57.299 region:rollup2
WHERE THAT RESPONSIBILITY IN THE

01:23:54.863 --> 01:23:58.600 region:rollup2
ROLES LIFE SO I THINK THAT IS.

01:23:57.299 --> 01:23:59.868 region:rollup2
AN EASY FIX IN MY OPINION I

01:23:58.600 --> 01:24:01.703 region:rollup2
THINK IT'S JUST MAKING SURE WE

01:23:59.868 --> 01:24:02.538 region:rollup2
CLARIFY THAT ALL THE WAY DOWN

01:24:01.703 --> 01:24:04.706 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE RANKS.

01:24:02.538 --> 01:24:07.242 region:rollup2
.

01:24:04.706 --> 01:24:09.378 region:rollup2
WE HAVE DONE ALSO A BIT OF WOOD

01:24:07.242 --> 01:24:11.713 region:rollup2
AND BEGINNING TO CONTINUE TO RE

01:24:09.378 --> 01:24:13.682 region:rollup2
ORGANIZE INTERNALLY TO HAVE A

01:24:11.713 --> 01:24:15.250 region:rollup2
COUPLE OTHER POINTS PEOPLE WE

01:24:13.682 --> 01:24:17.152 region:rollup2
HAVE SOMEBODY THAT WE RECENTLY

01:24:15.250 --> 01:24:20.155 region:rollup2
PUT IN PLACE AS A. EXECUTIVE

01:24:17.152 --> 01:24:22.224 region:rollup2
LEVEL OB PROJECT MANAGER FOR ALL

01:24:20.155 --> 01:24:23.425 region:rollup2
THINGS WERE A BILL SO THIS

01:24:22.224 --> 01:24:24.626 region:rollup2
PERSON WORKS WHICH ALL THEY WORK

01:24:23.425 --> 01:24:25.661 region:rollup2
WITH THEIR COKE BUT THEY'RE ALSO

01:24:24.626 --> 01:24:27.062 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT THE BROADER SCALE

01:24:25.661 --> 01:24:28.697 region:rollup2
KEEPING AN EYE ON THE

01:24:27.062 --> 01:24:30.465 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTION THE DAY TO DAY. SO

01:24:28.697 --> 01:24:32.367 region:rollup2
WE'RE MAKING SURE EVERYBODY

01:24:30.465 --> 01:24:34.403 region:rollup2
KNOWS THAT THAT PERSON. ALL

01:24:32.367 --> 01:24:35.771 region:rollup2
ORVILLE COMMUNICATIONS

01:24:34.403 --> 01:24:37.039 region:rollup2
CORRESPONDENCE

01:24:35.771 --> 01:24:38.240 region:rollup2
GOES THROUGH THAT PERSON AND IN

01:24:37.039 --> 01:24:39.841 region:rollup2
FACT THAT PERSON KEEPS MYSELF

01:24:38.240 --> 01:24:41.710 region:rollup2
FOR DIRECTOR IN THE OTHER

01:24:39.841 --> 01:24:43.045 region:rollup2
DEPUTIES INFORMED SO WE'RE GONNA

01:24:41.710 --> 01:24:44.780 region:rollup2
TIGHTENING THAT THAT INTERNAL

01:24:43.045 --> 01:24:47.282 region:rollup2
STRUCTURE AROUND INFORMATION

01:24:44.780 --> 01:24:48.583 region:rollup2

01:24:47.282 --> 01:24:50.552 region:rollup2
AND INSIDE AND OUT AND I KNOW

01:24:48.583 --> 01:24:52.521 region:rollup2
THERE WILL BE OTHERIMPROVEMENTS

01:24:50.552 --> 01:24:53.522 region:rollup2
SERVE ENHANCEMENTS THAT WE WILL

01:24:52.521 --> 01:24:56.058 region:rollup2
NEED TO MAKE.

WE HAVE YOU KNOW THE CAPACITY

01:24:56.058 --> 01:24:59.962 region:rollup2
TO DO THINGS THERE ARE INTERNAL

THE PUBLIC BUT ALSO WE HAVE A

01:25:08.804 --> 01:25:11.673 region:rollup2
LOT OF STAFF THAT.

01:25:10.539 --> 01:25:12.975 region:rollup2
HER ARMOR CLUED INTO THAT

01:25:11.673 --> 01:25:14.543 region:rollup2
LOOKING TO THAT GETTING

01:25:12.975 --> 01:25:16.044 region:rollup2
INFORMATION FROM THERE AS WE CAN

01:25:14.543 --> 01:25:18.614 region:rollup2
USE THAT AS A TOOL TO KEEP

PEOPLE INFORMED WE HAVE AN FAQ.

01:25:18.614 --> 01:25:21.483 region:rollup2
I THINK THEY'LL BE SOME

01:25:19.648 --> 01:25:23.352 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL FAQS THAT COME OUT OF

01:25:21.483 --> 01:25:24.152 region:rollup2
THE FORENSIC TEAM REPORT THAT WE

01:25:23.352 --> 01:25:25.787 region:rollup2
WANT TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE ARE

01:25:24.152 --> 01:25:27.856 region:rollup2
AWARE OF. THIS IS

01:25:25.787 --> 01:25:28.991 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW UP.

01:25:27.856 --> 01:25:30.459 region:rollup2
GOOD THE ROLES OF DIFFERENT

01:25:28.991 --> 01:25:31.994 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS THIS IS WHAT DIFFERENT

01:25:30.459 --> 01:25:33.328 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS RESPONSIBLE FOR SO

01:25:31.994 --> 01:25:34.029 region:rollup2
WE CAN WE CAN GET THE WORD OUT

01:25:33.328 --> 01:25:35.664 region:rollup2
THAT WAY AS WELL.

01:25:34.029 --> 01:25:36.465 region:rollup2

01:25:36.465 --> 01:25:40.769 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY WITH OUR

01:25:38.166 --> 01:25:42.504 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONAL TOM.

01:25:40.769 --> 01:25:43.171 region:rollup2
S. STRUCTURE TRAINING THAT

01:25:42.504 --> 01:25:44.239 region:rollup2
SOMETHING WILL NEED TO LOOK AT

01:25:43.171 --> 01:25:45.641 region:rollup2
IT AND I THINK THERE WERE SOME

01:25:44.239 --> 01:25:47.743 region:rollup2
GOOD OPTIONS WITHIN THE

01:25:45.641 --> 01:25:49.211 region:rollup2

JUST GIVE THAT INFORMATION FLOW

01:26:05.160 --> 01:26:08.630 region:rollup2
I THINK IN IN MY OPINION.

01:26:07.496 --> 01:26:10.899 region:rollup2
PART OF WHAT I I GOT FROM THE

01:26:08.630 --> 01:26:12.501 region:rollup2
REPORT WAS WE JUST NEED TO MAKE

WILL CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION

01:26:24.479 --> 01:26:27.249 region:rollup2
AND IF THERE'S AN ADDITIONAL

01:26:25.047 --> 01:26:28.383 region:rollup2

01:26:29.251 --> 01:26:30.919 region:rollup2
PROVIDE UPDATES AS WE KIND OF

01:26:30.419 --> 01:26:32.688 region:rollup2
BUILD IT'S IT'S IT'S A

01:26:30.919 --> 01:26:34.723 region:rollup2
COMPLICATED. PROCESS IT'S A BIG

01:26:32.688 --> 01:26:36.158 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT WE'VE MADE SOME

01:26:34.723 --> 01:26:37.159 region:rollup2
INITIAL STEPS THAT WE'RE GOING

01:26:36.158 --> 01:26:38.493 region:rollup2
TO BUILDING A PRCE LIKE THINK

01:26:37.159 --> 01:26:39.628 region:rollup2
MY CONCERN IS THAT IT SOUNDS

01:26:38.493 --> 01:26:40.529 region:rollup2
LIKE A LOT OF FOLKS I DIDN'T

01:26:39.628 --> 01:26:43.165 region:rollup2
REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT THE

01:26:40.529 --> 01:26:44.666 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITIES OR. AND SO IF

01:26:43.165 --> 01:26:48.503 region:rollup2
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE

01:26:44.666 --> 01:26:50.739 region:rollup2
ADDRESSING THAT I HAVE MY ANSWER

01:26:48.503 --> 01:26:51.740 region:rollup2
OR I'M SORRY THE ANSWER THAT I'M

01:26:50.739 --> 01:26:57.913 region:rollup2
LOOKING FOR.

01:26:51.740 --> 01:27:00.849 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW A COMPLACENCY I LOVE.

01:26:57.913 --> 01:27:02.417 region:rollup2
DOCTOR EGGMAN'S ANALOGY BECAUSE

01:27:00.849 --> 01:27:05.287 region:rollup2
THE COMPLACENT SOUNDS LIKE.

01:27:02.417 --> 01:27:07.989 region:rollup2
THERE WAS A LOT OF COMPLACENCY

01:27:05.287 --> 01:27:10.192 region:rollup2
AND I. PEOPLE DIDN'T REALLY

01:27:07.989 --> 01:27:14.096 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND WHAT THE ROLES AND

01:27:10.192 --> 01:27:15.997 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITIES WERE AND SO

01:27:14.096 --> 01:27:21.770 region:rollup2
THAT'S A MORE WHEN I'M LOOKING

01:27:15.997 --> 01:27:25.207 region:rollup2
FOR OKAY. I'M I THINK TO A DO

01:27:21.770 --> 01:27:30.512 region:rollup2
OU WANT HIM MAYBE IF I CAN HAVE

01:27:25.207 --> 01:27:31.513 region:rollup2
A LITTLE. TOO DEPUTY

01:27:30.512 --> 01:27:32.647 region:rollup2
I JUST SAID.

01:27:31.513 --> 01:27:34.416 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW ONE.

01:27:32.647 --> 01:27:35.584 region:rollup2
WE WE AS WE WERE EXAMINING

01:27:34.416 --> 01:27:36.518 region:rollup2
OURSELVES AFTER FEBRUARY WE

01:27:35.584 --> 01:27:37.119 region:rollup2
STARTED RECOVERY THERE'S A LOT

01:27:36.518 --> 01:27:42.524 region:rollup2
OF CONCLUSIONS IN HERE THAT WE

01:27:37.119 --> 01:27:45.293 region:rollup2
OURSELVES CRADDOCK.

01:27:42.524 --> 01:27:46.762 region:rollup2
AND HE'S HE'S ALSO SUPPORTING SO

01:27:45.293 --> 01:27:49.698 region:rollup2
WE HAVE NOW TAKEN CARE ALL

01:27:46.762 --> 01:27:52.434 region:rollup2
COMMUNICATION. ALL THAT'S GOING

01:27:49.698 --> 01:27:53.668 region:rollup2
ON THROUGH ONE EXECUTIVE THAT IS

01:27:52.434 --> 01:27:55.003 region:rollup2
WAYNE AND AND THAT'S HIS DAY JOB

01:27:53.668 --> 01:27:58.106 region:rollup2
NOW.

01:27:55.003 --> 01:28:00.175 region:rollup2
FOR NOW. AS WE CONTINUE TO TAKE

01:27:58.106 --> 01:28:01.676 region:rollup2
THIS BECAUSE WE'RE NOT DONE. YOU

01:28:00.175 --> 01:28:03.578 region:rollup2
KNOW ABSORBING ALL OF IT AND

01:28:01.676 --> 01:28:04.813 region:rollup2
REALLY COMING OUT WITH WHAT IS

01:28:03.578 --> 01:28:07.749 region:rollup2
THE WORK STRUCTURE THAT MAKE

01:28:04.813 --> 01:28:09.751 region:rollup2
SURE THEIR IS A SINGLE EXECUTIVE

01:28:07.749 --> 01:28:11.987 region:rollup2
THAT'S REALLY WEIGHING IN ON ALL

01:28:09.751 --> 01:28:13.288 region:rollup2
DECISIONS RELATED THEY CAN MAKE

01:28:11.987 --> 01:28:15.757 region:rollup2
TAKEN THAT RISK.

01:28:13.288 --> 01:28:18.894 region:rollup2
AND PUT IT INTO HOW WE MANAGE

01:28:15.757 --> 01:28:20.162 region:rollup2
ALL OUR ASSETS.

01:28:18.894 --> 01:28:21.496 region:rollup2
PUTTING THE DAM SAFETY PROGRAM.

01:28:20.162 --> 01:28:23.899 region:rollup2
AND SO I THINK THAT WE'RE TAKING

01:28:21.496 --> 01:28:25.967 region:rollup2
THOSE STEPS THE COMMUNICATION.

01:28:23.899 --> 01:28:29.371 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW UNFORTUNATELY UNTIL ONE

01:28:25.967 --> 01:28:30.338 region:rollup2
AM. D. AN ENGINEERING HIS.

01:28:29.371 --> 01:28:31.506 region:rollup2
CARMEN IN THE INDUSTRY THAT

01:28:30.338 --> 01:28:32.507 region:rollup2
THERE'S ALWAYS THAT NATURAL

01:28:31.506 --> 01:28:34.509 region:rollup2
ENGINEERING TENSION.

01:28:32.507 --> 01:28:36.912 region:rollup2
BUT IT CAN NOT CONTINUE

01:28:34.509 --> 01:28:38.046 region:rollup2
OTHERWISE THE DOCKS THAT MR

01:28:36.912 --> 01:28:39.047 region:rollup2
FRANCE WAS TALKING ABOUT WON'T

01:28:38.046 --> 01:28:41.082 region:rollup2
ALWAYS GET CONNECTED SO THE

01:28:39.047 --> 01:28:42.384 region:rollup2
COMMUNICATION IS VERY IMPORTANT

01:28:41.082 --> 01:28:43.518 region:rollup2
AND WE NEED TO BUILD WE NEED TO

01:28:42.384 --> 01:28:44.953 region:rollup2
BREAK DOWN THE SILOS AND MAKE

01:28:43.518 --> 01:28:46.254 region:rollup2
SURE THEY ARE COMMUNICATING.

01:28:44.953 --> 01:28:48.323 region:rollup2
SO THAT WHEN WE IMPLEMENT THE

01:28:46.254 --> 01:28:49.357 region:rollup2
NEW PROCESS IS A MORE

01:28:48.323 --> 01:28:51.760 region:rollup2
COMPREHENSIVE REVIEWS ALL THE

01:28:49.357 --> 01:28:53.728 region:rollup2
WAY TO DESIGN.

01:28:51.760 --> 01:28:56.231 region:rollup2
THAT DOES DOTS ARE LOOKED AT AND

01:28:53.728 --> 01:28:58.166 region:rollup2
SEEN AND AND WE CAN TAKE ACTION

01:28:56.231 --> 01:28:59.467 region:rollup2
ON SO WE STARTED NOW WITH AN

01:28:58.166 --> 01:29:00.969 region:rollup2
EXECUTIVE WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE

01:28:59.467 --> 01:29:03.638 region:rollup2
TO PUSH THAT AND THIS FORENSIC

01:29:00.969 --> 01:29:06.675 region:rollup2
REPORT. INFORMATION WILL LEAD US

01:29:03.638 --> 01:29:07.342 region:rollup2
TO VOTERS WAS OUR FINAL OR.

01:29:06.675 --> 01:29:10.545 region:rollup2
AND THAT TOP DOWN APPROACH LOOKS

01:29:07.342 --> 01:29:12.514 region:rollup2
LIKE.

01:29:10.545 --> 01:29:13.882 region:rollup2
IS IT OKAY TO ADD JUST ONE MORE

01:29:12.514 --> 01:29:14.716 region:rollup2
THING TO CIRCLE BACK TO SORT OF

01:29:13.882 --> 01:29:16.685 region:rollup2
THE RELATIONSHIP QUESTION I JUST

01:29:14.716 --> 01:29:17.786 region:rollup2
WANTED TO COMMENT THAT I THINK

01:29:16.685 --> 01:29:18.920 region:rollup2
YOU FOR THE KNOWLEDGE MEAN ABOUT

01:29:17.786 --> 01:29:20.822 region:rollup2
BEING UNDER THE MICROSCOPE AND

01:29:18.920 --> 01:29:22.991 region:rollup2
ALL EYES ON US. IT IS A VERY

01:29:20.822 --> 01:29:24.392 region:rollup2
UNCOMFORTABLE PLACE BUT I WILL

01:29:22.991 --> 01:29:25.460 region:rollup2
SAY THAT I THINK.

01:29:24.392 --> 01:29:27.195 region:rollup2
THE SILVER LINING OF IT IS IT

01:29:25.460 --> 01:29:28.530 region:rollup2
WILL.

01:29:27.195 --> 01:29:30.365 region:rollup2
MOVE US FORWARD IN TERMS OF

01:29:28.530 --> 01:29:31.499 region:rollup2
IMPROVEMENTS AND CHANGES AND

01:29:30.365 --> 01:29:33.001 region:rollup2
ENHANCEMENTS NONPROFIT A FASTER

01:29:31.499 --> 01:29:35.503 region:rollup2
PACE

01:29:33.001 --> 01:29:37.939 region:rollup2
THEN WE WOULD SO WHILE NOT FUN I

01:29:35.503 --> 01:29:39.407 region:rollup2
DO. MYSELF AND OTHERS WELCOME IT

01:29:37.939 --> 01:29:42.010 region:rollup2
AS.

01:29:39.407 --> 01:29:43.578 region:rollup2
OF MOMENTUM TO TO KIND OF KEEP

01:29:42.010 --> 01:29:45.180 region:rollup2
THIS GOING HANGING MAKE THE

01:29:43.578 --> 01:29:46.381 region:rollup2
IMPROVEMENTS IN THE CHANGES AND

01:29:45.180 --> 01:29:48.383 region:rollup2
BE CREATIVE AND ADD AND KIND OF

01:29:46.381 --> 01:29:48.984 region:rollup2
THINKING OUTSIDE OF THE BOX SO I

01:29:48.383 --> 01:29:50.418 region:rollup2
JUST WANTED TO THROW THAT OUT

01:29:48.984 --> 01:29:51.052 region:rollup2
THERE.

01:29:50.418 --> 01:29:52.687 region:rollup2
JUST AN ADDITIONAL COMMENT ARM.

01:29:51.052 --> 01:29:55.423 region:rollup2
IT.

01:29:52.687 --> 01:29:57.759 region:rollup2
I'VE ASKED IN.

01:29:55.423 --> 01:29:58.193 region:rollup2
IT'S DIFFERENT MOVIES BUT WHAT

01:29:57.759 --> 01:29:59.828 region:rollup2
UC ACCOUNTABILITY.

01:29:58.193 --> 01:30:01.296 region:rollup2
.

01:29:59.828 --> 01:30:02.731 region:rollup2
PRACTICES I GUESS IF YOU IF YOU

01:30:01.296 --> 01:30:04.332 region:rollup2
WELL I MEAN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:30:02.731 --> 01:30:05.200 region:rollup2
IMPROVEMENTS YOU KNOW ETCETERA

01:30:04.332 --> 01:30:06.268 region:rollup2
ETCETERA WHAT ACCOUNTABILITY

01:30:05.200 --> 01:30:07.535 region:rollup2
MECHANISMS ARE GOING TO PUT IN

01:30:06.268 --> 01:30:09.638 region:rollup2
PLACE TO MAKE SRE THAT. YOU

01:30:07.535 --> 01:30:11.206 region:rollup2
KNOW THESE FOLKS THAT.

01:30:09.638 --> 01:30:13.608 region:rollup2
WHATEVER THE THE ISSUES MAY BE.

01:30:11.206 --> 01:30:15.210 region:rollup2
KIDS WE CAN TALK ABOUT

01:30:13.608 --> 01:30:16.511 region:rollup2
PRACTICES AND YOU KNOW CHANGIN

01:30:15.210 --> 01:30:17.345 region:rollup2
THE POLICIES AND ALL OF THAT BUT

01:30:16.511 --> 01:30:19.281 region:rollup2
IF THERE'S NO ACCOUNTABILITY

01:30:17.345 --> 01:30:21.116 region:rollup2
WILL. MATTER.

01:30:19.281 --> 01:30:22.117 region:rollup2
UNIT WE CAN PUT THE BEST

01:30:21.116 --> 01:30:23.285 region:rollup2
PRACTICES IN PLACE BUT IF

01:30:22.117 --> 01:30:25.854 region:rollup2
THERE'S NOBODY BEING HELD

01:30:23.285 --> 01:30:27.889 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT.

01:30:25.854 --> 01:30:30.091 region:rollup2
WHATEVER YOU PUT IN PLACES IS IS

01:30:27.889 --> 01:30:31.393 region:rollup2
BEING FOLLOWED SO. I GUESS IT'S

01:30:30.091 --> 01:30:32.994 region:rollup2
NOT REALLY A QUESTION IT'S MORE

01:30:31.393 --> 01:30:34.162 region:rollup2
OF A COMMENT BUT YOU KNOW I I

01:30:32.994 --> 01:30:34.629 region:rollup2
URGE YOU TO THINK ABOUT

01:30:34.162 --> 01:30:36.097 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABILITY BECAUSE

01:30:34.629 --> 01:30:38.833 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES.

01:30:36.097 --> 01:30:39.567 region:rollup2
AND I FOUND THAT IN MANY OF OUR

01:30:38.833 --> 01:30:42.704 region:rollup2
AGENCIES THERE IS NO REAL

01:30:39.567 --> 01:30:45.206 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABILITY. AYE AND.

01:30:42.704 --> 01:30:46.207 region:rollup2
THE THE WE CAN TALK TO OR PLAN

01:30:45.206 --> 01:30:47.709 region:rollup2
THE FACE BUT IF NOBODY'S BEEN

01:30:46.207 --> 01:30:49.277 region:rollup2
HELD ACCOUNTABLE THEN INCIDENTS

01:30:47.709 --> 01:30:49.844 region:rollup2
LIKE THIS CAN HAPPEN AGAIN ARE

01:30:49.277 --> 01:30:50.912 region:rollup2
HOPEFULLY NOT TO THIS EXTENT

01:30:49.844 --> 01:30:52.614 region:rollup2
BUT.

01:30:50.912 --> 01:30:54.582 region:rollup2
WE HAVE A LOT OF OTHER NO ILENE

01:30:52.614 --> 01:30:56.284 region:rollup2
AYE INFRASTRUCTURE. ARE AND IF

01:30:54.582 --> 01:30:57.519 region:rollup2
THERE IS NO COMMUNICATION AND

01:30:56.284 --> 01:30:58.987 region:rollup2
THERE'S NO REAL ACCOUNTABILITY

01:30:57.519 --> 01:31:01.022 region:rollup2
IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AGAIN AND

01:30:58.987 --> 01:31:04.025 region:rollup2
SO I GUESS IN IN YOUR AYE

01:31:01.022 --> 01:31:07.595 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTATION OF. OF OUR

01:31:04.025 --> 01:31:09.631 region:rollup2
PRACTICES THERE HAS TO BE A REAL

01:31:07.595 --> 01:31:11.599 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABILITY.

01:31:09.631 --> 01:31:12.600 region:rollup2
BOB PIECE ATTACHED TO ALL THOSE

01:31:11.599 --> 01:31:13.268 region:rollup2
AND SO HOPEFULLY WHEN YOU COME

01:31:12.600 --> 01:31:14.369 region:rollup2
UP WITH THAT IF WE CAN GET SOME

01:31:13.268 --> 01:31:16.438 region:rollup2
INFORMATION ON HOW. YOU'RE GOING

01:31:14.369 --> 01:31:17.372 region:rollup2
TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE

01:31:16.438 --> 01:31:19.441 region:rollup2
PRACTICES ARE BEING PHAM.

01:31:17.372 --> 01:31:21.476 region:rollup2
THINK.

01:31:19.441 --> 01:31:23.578 region:rollup2
DISA DERBY CAN BE VERY PAINFUL.

01:31:21.476 --> 01:31:25.347 region:rollup2
OF AND I'M ALSO PLEASED.

01:31:23.578 --> 01:31:26.047 region:rollup2
AND ALL SAVE FOR FOR THOSE WHO

01:31:25.347 --> 01:31:27.582 region:rollup2
DON'T KNOW THAT THAT NEW

01:31:26.047 --> 01:31:28.984 region:rollup2
DIRECTOR JUST PINPOINT GRANT

01:31:27.582 --> 01:31:30.719 region:rollup2
DAVIS. IS FROM OUTSIDE THE

01:31:28.984 --> 01:31:31.653 region:rollup2
AGENCY SO I THINK THAT'S A GOOD

01:31:30.719 --> 01:31:33.288 region:rollup2
THING YOU TALKED ABOUT SOME THE

01:31:31.653 --> 01:31:34.622 region:rollup2
COMPLACENCY THAT CAN OCCUR WHEN

01:31:33.288 --> 01:31:36.057 region:rollup2
EVERYBODY'S BEEN A REALLY LONG

01:31:34.622 --> 01:31:37.392 region:rollup2
TIME. WHICH IS TO CONVERT NATURE

01:31:36.057 --> 01:31:38.560 region:rollup2
BUREAUCRACY BUT HAVING NEW

01:31:37.392 --> 01:31:39.527 region:rollup2
OUTSIDE EYES COMING IN AS A

01:31:38.560 --> 01:31:44.299 region:rollup2
DIRECTOR.

01:31:39.527 --> 01:31:46.234 region:rollup2
I THINK WILL BE GOOD A.

01:31:44.299 --> 01:31:48.470 region:rollup2
MR PATERSON DID YOU.

01:31:46.234 --> 01:31:49.504 region:rollup2
MISTER PATTERSON.

01:31:48.470 --> 01:31:51.606 region:rollup2
A COUPLE QUESTIONS.

01:31:49.504 --> 01:31:54.309 region:rollup2
FIRST TO UP.

01:31:51.606 --> 01:31:55.110 region:rollup2
FRETS UMP. AYE. I'M REALLY

01:31:54.309 --> 01:31:57.078 region:rollup2
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND.

01:31:55.110 --> 01:31:58.580 region:rollup2
.

01:31:57.078 --> 01:32:00.749 region:rollup2
WHAT APPEARS TO BE CANARIES IN

01:31:58.580 --> 01:32:04.886 region:rollup2
THE COAL MINE THAT WERE IGNORED?

01:32:00.749 --> 01:32:05.053 region:rollup2
WE HEARD WE HEARD ABOUT CRACKS.

01:32:04.886 --> 01:32:07.122 region:rollup2
AND.

01:32:05.053 --> 01:32:08.390 region:rollup2
FLOWS.

01:32:07.122 --> 01:32:10.925 region:rollup2
AND WE ALSO HEARD ABOUT BORE

01:32:08.390 --> 01:32:12.594 region:rollup2
HOLES AS FUNDAMENTAL REASONS FOR

01:32:10.925 --> 01:32:14.362 region:rollup2
I GUESS THAT.

01:32:12.594 --> 01:32:16.765 region:rollup2
A FAILURE.

01:32:14.362 --> 01:32:20.268 region:rollup2
.

01:32:16.765 --> 01:32:22.704 region:rollup2
HOW WOULD YOU ASSESS?

01:32:20.268 --> 01:32:25.173 region:rollup2
WHETHER THIS WAS.

01:32:22.704 --> 01:32:27.409 region:rollup2
A REASONABLE OVERSIGHT.

01:32:25.173 --> 01:32:28.877 region:rollup2
OUR A PRACTICE OVER TIME THAT

01:32:27.409 --> 01:32:29.677 region:rollup2
SOMEHOW DEVELOPED WITH MAYBE

01:32:28.877 --> 01:32:31.579 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE COMPLACENCY THAT

01:32:29.677 --> 01:32:34.015 region:rollup2
WE'RE HEARING ABOUT.

01:32:31.579 --> 01:32:36.551 region:rollup2
AND TO WHAT DEGREE DID THIS

01:32:34.015 --> 01:32:38.386 region:rollup2
SURPRISE YOU OR SH SHAKE YOU.

01:32:36.551 --> 01:32:40.789 region:rollup2
.

01:32:38.386 --> 01:32:41.956 region:rollup2
WAS IT A RED LIGHT SIGNAL GOING

01:32:40.789 --> 01:32:43.858 region:rollup2
OFFER WAS IT A CAUTION SIGNAL

01:32:41.956 --> 01:32:45.160 region:rollup2
THAT WAS.

01:32:43.858 --> 01:32:47.095 region:rollup2
FLASHING SHOULD THIS HAVE BEEN

01:32:45.160 --> 01:32:49.164 region:rollup2
DISCOVERED.

01:32:47.095 --> 01:32:51.666 region:rollup2
IT.

01:32:49.164 --> 01:32:52.600 region:rollup2
IT WAS NOT A RED LIGHT SIGNAL OF

01:32:51.666 --> 01:32:54.702 region:rollup2
AND IF I CAN GO BACK TO YOUR

01:32:52.600 --> 01:32:55.336 region:rollup2
CANARIES IN THE COALMINE ANALOGY

01:32:54.702 --> 01:32:57.405 region:rollup2
A MOMENT AGO.

01:32:55.336 --> 01:32:59.174 region:rollup2
THE CANARIES MAY HAVE BEEN IN

01:32:57.405 --> 01:33:01.209 region:rollup2
THE COAL MINE BUT THEY WERE IN A

01:32:59.174 --> 01:33:01.709 region:rollup2
DEEP SECTION OF THE COAL MINE

01:33:01.209 --> 01:33:03.311 region:rollup2
THAT WASN'T BEING WORKED

01:33:01.709 --> 01:33:05.079 region:rollup2
ANYMORE.

01:33:03.311 --> 01:33:07.482 region:rollup2
SO THAT PEOPLE WEREN'T THERE

01:33:05.079 --> 01:33:08.950 region:rollup2
SEEING THOSE CANARIES THAT THE

01:33:07.482 --> 01:33:10.452 region:rollup2
DATA THAT SHOWED LEAD TO

01:33:08.950 --> 01:33:12.087 region:rollup2
PROBLEMS WITH THE GEOLOGY WAS IN

01:33:10.452 --> 01:33:13.588 region:rollup2
THE RECORDS.

01:33:12.087 --> 01:33:15.190 region:rollup2
OF THE W. ARE THEY WERE THERE

01:33:13.588 --> 01:33:16.357 region:rollup2
BUT YOU HAD TO GO DEEP INTO

01:33:15.190 --> 01:33:17.959 region:rollup2
THOSE RECORDS BACK TO NINETEEN

01:33:16.357 --> 01:33:20.195 region:rollup2
SIXTIES YOU NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR

01:33:17.959 --> 01:33:22.096 region:rollup2
TO FIND. SOME OF THE LATER

01:33:20.195 --> 01:33:24.165 region:rollup2
REPORTS DIDN'T REPEAT IT AND

01:33:22.096 --> 01:33:25.934 region:rollup2
THEN AS I TALKED ABOUT WITH THIS

01:33:24.165 --> 01:33:27.902 region:rollup2
NORMALIZATION OF THE OF THE

01:33:25.934 --> 01:33:29.537 region:rollup2
UNUSUAL BEHAVIOR THE CRACKS IN

01:33:27.902 --> 01:33:31.306 region:rollup2
THE AND THE TRAINS. NOBODY

01:33:29.537 --> 01:33:33.408 region:rollup2
THOUGHT ABOUT IT ANYMORE.

01:33:31.306 --> 01:33:35.176 region:rollup2
THAT I MENTIONED EARLIER THAT

01:33:33.408 --> 01:33:35.643 region:rollup2
THE TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN

01:33:35.176 --> 01:33:37.779 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL FAILURE MODE

01:33:35.643 --> 01:33:40.014 region:rollup2
ANALYSIS-ALMOST GOT THERE.

01:33:37.779 --> 01:33:41.983 region:rollup2
BUT BECAUSE

01:33:40.014 --> 01:33:43.151 region:rollup2
THEY CONCLUDED THAT IT WOULDN'T

01:33:41.983 --> 01:33:45.119 region:rollup2
RELEASED THE RESERVOIR THEY

01:33:43.151 --> 01:33:46.454 region:rollup2
DIDN'T DIG THAT BIT DEEPER THAT

01:33:45.119 --> 01:33:47.722 region:rollup2
YOU HAD TO GO BACK INTO THOSE

01:33:46.454 --> 01:33:49.390 region:rollup2
RECORDS TO FIND IT. SO IT WAS

01:33:47.722 --> 01:33:51.059 region:rollup2
THERE

01:33:49.390 --> 01:33:52.160 region:rollup2
BUT YOU HAD TO DIG FOR THAT

01:33:51.059 --> 01:33:53.261 region:rollup2
THERE WASN'T A FLASHING RED

01:33:52.160 --> 01:33:55.063 region:rollup2
LIGHT RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU AND

01:33:53.261 --> 01:33:56.331 region:rollup2
THAT'S A LITTLE. IS WE TALK

01:33:55.063 --> 01:33:59.868 region:rollup2
ABOUT THIS MORE DETAIL IN THE

01:33:56.331 --> 01:34:01.703 region:rollup2
REPORT IT'S MORE A PRACTICE.

01:33:59.868 --> 01:34:03.204 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT A TYPICAL PRACTICE WHAT

01:34:01.703 --> 01:34:04.839 region:rollup2
OUR INDUSTRY IS DOING RIGHT NOW

01:34:03.204 --> 01:34:06.241 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S WHY OUR INDUSTRY I'M

01:34:04.839 --> 01:34:08.376 region:rollup2
A PART OF IT IS SO I NEED TO

01:34:06.241 --> 01:34:10.445 region:rollup2
LEARN THIS TO. WE NEED TO LEARN

01:34:08.376 --> 01:34:11.279 region:rollup2
THAT THAT WE NEED TO DO MORE OF

01:34:10.445 --> 01:34:12.046 region:rollup2
THAT DEEP DIVE INTO THE

01:34:11.279 --> 01:34:15.550 region:rollup2
INFORMATION.

01:34:12.046 --> 01:34:16.584 region:rollup2
.

01:34:15.550 --> 01:34:19.254 region:rollup2
SO FROM THE STANDPOINT OF DID IT

01:34:16.584 --> 01:34:21.289 region:rollup2
SURPRISE US.

01:34:19.254 --> 01:34:23.091 region:rollup2
IT DID SURPRISE ME UNFORTUNATELY

01:34:21.289 --> 01:34:24.626 region:rollup2
I HAVE TO SAY NO IT DIDN'T

01:34:23.091 --> 01:34:26.394 region:rollup2
SURPRISE ME BECAUSE.

01:34:24.626 --> 01:34:28.263 region:rollup2
I KNOW THE WAY THE INDUSTRY

01:34:26.394 --> 01:34:30.832 region:rollup2
WORKS AND AND THAT'S WHERE WE

01:34:28.263 --> 01:34:31.466 region:rollup2
HAVE TO IMPROVE OUR WAY OF DOING

01:34:30.832 --> 01:34:32.534 region:rollup2
THINGS TO DO IT BETTER SO THERE

01:34:31.466 --> 01:34:34.435 region:rollup2
WASN'T A FLASHING RED LIGHT THAT

01:34:32.534 --> 01:34:36.237 region:rollup2
WAS MISSED. YOU HAD TO BE A LOT

01:34:34.435 --> 01:34:37.138 region:rollup2
MORE DILIGENT TO GET IS THERE IS

01:34:36.237 --> 01:34:39.240 region:rollup2
THERE ANY.

01:34:37.138 --> 01:34:40.808 region:rollup2
UP.

01:34:39.240 --> 01:34:42.210 region:rollup2
IN YOUR EXPERIENCE HERE AND

01:34:40.808 --> 01:34:45.213 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT THIS.

01:34:42.210 --> 01:34:46.881 region:rollup2
ARE THERE OTHER.

01:34:45.213 --> 01:34:47.749 region:rollup2
BUT WHAT KEEPS YOU AWAKE AT

01:34:46.881 --> 01:34:50.084 region:rollup2
NIGHT YOU HAVE DUG THROUGH ALL

01:34:47.749 --> 01:34:51.886 region:rollup2
OF THIS.

01:34:50.084 --> 01:34:52.787 region:rollup2
AND YOU ARE A RENOWNED EXPERT

01:34:51.886 --> 01:34:53.988 region:rollup2
AND YOUR TEAM WAS A RENOWNED

01:34:52.787 --> 01:34:56.457 region:rollup2
EXPERT.

01:34:53.988 --> 01:34:57.992 region:rollup2
.

01:34:56.457 --> 01:35:00.061 region:rollup2
APART FROM LEARNING ABOUT WHAT

01:34:57.992 --> 01:35:03.164 region:rollup2
WENT WRONG HERE.

01:35:00.061 --> 01:35:03.932 region:rollup2
DO YOU. HAVE ANY CONCERNS THAT

01:35:03.164 --> 01:35:05.867 region:rollup2
THERE ARE OTHER TICKING TIME

01:35:03.932 --> 01:35:06.935 region:rollup2
BOMBS BECAUSE OF THE STRUCTURE

01:35:05.867 --> 01:35:08.369 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THE OVER CONFIDENCE

01:35:06.935 --> 01:35:10.538 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF.

01:35:08.369 --> 01:35:12.607 region:rollup2
OF THE COMPLACENCY.

01:35:10.538 --> 01:35:14.142 region:rollup2
ARE THERE OTHER.

01:35:12.607 --> 01:35:15.343 region:rollup2
THINGS GOING ON OUT THERE WE

01:35:14.142 --> 01:35:16.978 region:rollup2
DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT YOU WORRY

01:35:15.343 --> 01:35:18.680 region:rollup2
OVER.

01:35:16.978 --> 01:35:20.782 region:rollup2
I DO.

01:35:18.680 --> 01:35:22.550 region:rollup2
BECAUSE PARENTS THE THE DAMN

01:35:20.782 --> 01:35:24.419 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE IS RELATIVELY OLD

01:35:22.550 --> 01:35:25.620 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT THE AVERAGE

01:35:24.419 --> 01:35:26.854 region:rollup2
AGE OF DAMS IS FIFTY YEARS ARE

01:35:25.620 --> 01:35:29.257 region:rollup2
GREATER.

01:35:26.854 --> 01:35:30.425 region:rollup2
AND A LOT OF OUR PROGRAMS ARE

01:35:29.257 --> 01:35:31.693 region:rollup2
NOT DOING THIS DEEP DIVE INTO

01:35:30.425 --> 01:35:33.561 region:rollup2
THE INFORMATION SO THAT'S THE

01:35:31.693 --> 01:35:34.829 region:rollup2
WORRY AND THAT'S WHAT I BELIEVE

01:35:33.561 --> 01:35:36.431 region:rollup2
IS THE WAKEUP CALL TO WEAR

01:35:34.829 --> 01:35:37.865 region:rollup2
INDUSTRIES WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND

01:35:36.431 --> 01:35:40.034 region:rollup2
THAT WE'RE RIGHT NOW NOT.

01:35:37.865 --> 01:35:42.036 region:rollup2
DIGGING IS DEEPLY AS WE NEED TO

01:35:40.034 --> 01:35:42.937 region:rollup2
DEFINE THOSE TICKING TIME BOMBS

01:35:42.036 --> 01:35:43.871 region:rollup2
IF YOU LIKE.

01:35:42.937 --> 01:35:45.573 region:rollup2
AND.

01:35:43.871 --> 01:35:47.642 region:rollup2
HOPEFULLY THIS WILL BE A LESSON

01:35:45.573 --> 01:35:48.910 region:rollup2
R. INDUSTRY WILL TAKE TO HEART

01:35:47.642 --> 01:35:50.311 region:rollup2
WILL LEARN AND WILL.

01:35:48.910 --> 01:35:50.945 region:rollup2
WE BUT IT IS GOING TO BE A

01:35:50.311 --> 01:35:52.914 region:rollup2
CHALLENGE FOR.

01:35:50.945 --> 01:35:55.116 region:rollup2
.

01:35:52.914 --> 01:35:56.050 region:rollup2
CORD LEGISLATURE'S LIKE YOURS

01:35:55.116 --> 01:35:57.485 region:rollup2
AND IN OTHER STATES AND THE

01:35:56.050 --> 01:35:59.320 region:rollup2
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BECAUSE IT

01:35:57.485 --> 01:36:00.488 region:rollup2
MAY TAKE MORE RESOURCES THAN

01:35:59.320 --> 01:36:02.724 region:rollup2
WE'VE BEEN PUTTING ON A

01:36:00.488 --> 01:36:05.026 region:rollup2
HISTORICALLY. I THINK AGENCIES

01:36:02.724 --> 01:36:06.761 region:rollup2
WILL TAKE A LOOK AT CAN THEY RE

01:36:05.026 --> 01:36:09.163 region:rollup2
EVALUATE AND AND REASSIGNED THE

01:36:06.761 --> 01:36:09.731 region:rollup2
RESOURCES THEY HAVE BUT SOME OF

01:36:09.163 --> 01:36:11.866 region:rollup2
THEM ARE GOING TO NEED MORE

01:36:09.731 --> 01:36:13.301 region:rollup2
RESOURCES. ALSO DEDUCED THESE

01:36:11.866 --> 01:36:15.770 region:rollup2
DEEP DIVES INTO THE INFORMATION

01:36:13.301 --> 01:36:16.404 region:rollup2
AND THEN MAKE THOSE EVALUATIONS

01:36:15.770 --> 01:36:18.139 region:rollup2
AYE YEAH I THINK THERE'S A LOT

01:36:16.404 --> 01:36:19.874 region:rollup2
OF OTHER. MEMBERS IN THIS

01:36:18.139 --> 01:36:20.575 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE WHO HAVE EXPRESSED

01:36:19.874 --> 01:36:21.676 region:rollup2
REAL CONCERN THAT ARE

01:36:20.575 --> 01:36:23.411 region:rollup2
FUNDAMENTAL INFRASTRUCTURE IS

01:36:21.676 --> 01:36:25.613 region:rollup2
NOT BEEN MODERNIZED. IN A LONG

01:36:23.411 --> 01:36:26.147 region:rollup2
LONG TIME AND THAT WE HAVE NOT

01:36:25.613 --> 01:36:28.716 region:rollup2
REALLY SPENT THE KIND OF

01:36:26.147 --> 01:36:32.387 region:rollup2
RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE A GEM OF

01:36:28.716 --> 01:36:33.721 region:rollup2
THE HYDROLOGY SYSTEM. BUT IT IS

01:36:32.387 --> 01:36:34.656 region:rollup2
OLD OUTDATED AND.

01:36:33.721 --> 01:36:35.957 region:rollup2
FRAUGHT WITH WITH SOME PROBLEMS

01:36:34.656 --> 01:36:37.125 region:rollup2
AND SO THIS IS NOT ONLY I THINK

01:36:35.957 --> 01:36:38.993 region:rollup2
FROM A WAKE UP CALL. FOR THE

01:36:37.125 --> 01:36:39.594 region:rollup2
OPERATION IT IS A WAKE UP CALL

01:36:38.993 --> 01:36:41.229 region:rollup2
FOR THE MODERNIZATION OF OUR

01:36:39.594 --> 01:36:42.497 region:rollup2
ENTIRE SYSTEM

01:36:41.229 --> 01:36:42.964 region:rollup2
AND IT CANNOT WAIT ANY ANY

01:36:42.497 --> 01:36:45.166 region:rollup2
LONGER A QUESTION TO.

01:36:42.964 --> 01:36:47.335 region:rollup2
.

01:36:45.166 --> 01:36:49.437 region:rollup2
TO DO D. W. ARE UP.

01:36:47.335 --> 01:36:52.106 region:rollup2
THAT PAGE FIFTY NINE AND IN THE

01:36:49.437 --> 01:36:54.208 region:rollup2
REPORT.

01:36:52.106 --> 01:36:57.111 region:rollup2
USED SOME LANGUAGE OF

01:36:54.208 --> 01:36:58.446 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANTLY OVERCONFIDENT.

01:36:57.111 --> 01:36:59.047 region:rollup2
AND COMPLACENT ABOUT THE

01:36:58.446 --> 01:37:00.381 region:rollup2
INTEGRITY OF ITS STATE WATER

01:36:59.047 --> 01:37:02.083 region:rollup2
PROJECT.

01:37:00.381 --> 01:37:03.785 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE.

01:37:02.083 --> 01:37:05.987 region:rollup2
.

01:37:03.785 --> 01:37:08.956 region:rollup2
I DO YOU. DO YOU CONCUR WITH THE

01:37:05.987 --> 01:37:10.124 region:rollup2
FINDINGS THAT.

01:37:08.956 --> 01:37:14.796 region:rollup2
THERE WAS COMPLACENCY THAT

01:37:10.124 --> 01:37:16.864 region:rollup2
OVERCONFIDENCE.

01:37:14.796 --> 01:37:19.367 region:rollup2
RIGHT POLLSTER WITHOUT ON ON.

01:37:16.864 --> 01:37:21.569 region:rollup2
AYE.

01:37:19.367 --> 01:37:22.970 region:rollup2
WE ARE CONFIDENT WE HAVE BEEN

01:37:21.569 --> 01:37:24.706 region:rollup2
CONFIDENT ABOUT THE

01:37:22.970 --> 01:37:26.441 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE OVERCONFIDENT I

01:37:24.706 --> 01:37:27.809 region:rollup2
DON'T KNOW THAT I.

01:37:26.441 --> 01:37:30.011 region:rollup2
COMPLETELY AGREE ARE NECESSARILY

01:37:27.809 --> 01:37:32.714 region:rollup2
AGREE WITH THAT STATEMENT.

01:37:30.011 --> 01:37:34.849 region:rollup2
I THINK THE CONFIDENCE CAME.

01:37:32.714 --> 01:37:36.751 region:rollup2
IN PART FROM THE INFORMATION

01:37:34.849 --> 01:37:38.619 region:rollup2
THAT WE'VE BEEN THE DATA WE'VE

01:37:36.751 --> 01:37:42.156 region:rollup2
BEEN WORKING WITH THAT. CONTINUE

01:37:38.619 --> 01:37:44.392 region:rollup2
TO LEAD US TO BELIEVE THAT.

01:37:42.156 --> 01:37:46.561 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE WAS.

01:37:44.392 --> 01:37:48.963 region:rollup2
IN GOOD SHAPE THEIR WARRANT

01:37:46.561 --> 01:37:50.131 region:rollup2
ISSUES THAT WE NOW RECOGNIZE

01:37:48.963 --> 01:37:52.066 region:rollup2
THERE ARE.

01:37:50.131 --> 01:37:54.068 region:rollup2
HOME I THINK.

01:37:52.066 --> 01:37:55.770 region:rollup2
BUT I WOULD ALSO.

01:37:54.068 --> 01:37:59.207 region:rollup2
NOT WHOLE HEARTEDLY AGREE WITH

01:37:55.770 --> 01:38:01.309 region:rollup2
COMPLACENCY BUT I. WOULD

01:37:59.207 --> 01:38:03.644 region:rollup2
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT.

01:38:01.309 --> 01:38:06.414 region:rollup2
AS A WAKE UP CALL THAT THIS IS

01:38:03.644 --> 01:38:08.316 region:rollup2
WE DO NEED TO NOT ONLY FOR THIS

01:38:06.414 --> 01:38:09.550 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR FOR STRUCTURE BUT THE

01:38:08.316 --> 01:38:11.152 region:rollup2
OTHER DAMS THAT WE ARE

01:38:09.550 --> 01:38:11.819 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT WE'VE

01:38:11.152 --> 01:38:13.755 region:rollup2
ALREADY BEGUN THESE RE

01:38:11.819 --> 01:38:14.922 region:rollup2
EVALUATIONS.

01:38:13.755 --> 01:38:18.292 region:rollup2
WE REALLY NEED TO NEED TO TAKE A

01:38:14.922 --> 01:38:19.727 region:rollup2
STEP BACK AND REALIZE THAT.

01:38:18.292 --> 01:38:21.529 region:rollup2
WE HAVE BEEN OPERATING TO THE

01:38:19.727 --> 01:38:23.798 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY STANDARDS TO WHAT THE

01:38:21.529 --> 01:38:25.299 region:rollup2
REGULATORS HAVE ASKED US TO DO

01:38:23.798 --> 01:38:26.834 region:rollup2
BUT WE DO NEED TO DO A DEEPER

01:38:25.299 --> 01:38:27.935 region:rollup2
DIVE AT THIS POINT TO REALLY

01:38:26.834 --> 01:38:30.037 region:rollup2
LOOK AT.

01:38:27.935 --> 01:38:32.006 region:rollup2
IT.

01:38:30.037 --> 01:38:32.306 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL ISSUES THE TRUE NATURE

01:38:32.006 --> 01:38:35.143 region:rollup2
OF THE TRUE.

01:38:32.306 --> 01:38:36.177 region:rollup2
.

01:38:35.143 --> 01:38:38.112 region:rollup2
I AM LOSING MY WE'RE HERE THE.

01:38:36.177 --> 01:38:40.281 region:rollup2
CURRENT STATUS OF.

01:38:38.112 --> 01:38:42.250 region:rollup2
DAMS OF OTHER SPILLWAYS SO WE

01:38:40.281 --> 01:38:43.785 region:rollup2
HAVE TO GET. AWAY AND COME BACK

01:38:42.250 --> 01:38:44.819 region:rollup2
WITH SOME FRESH ICE I THINK

01:38:43.785 --> 01:38:47.221 region:rollup2
MAYBE THAT'S THE WAY I WOULD

01:38:44.819 --> 01:38:48.756 region:rollup2
PERMITTED TO SAY. WE NEED TO DO

01:38:47.221 --> 01:38:49.891 region:rollup2
A DEEPER DIVE WE NEED TO GO ON

01:38:48.756 --> 01:38:50.558 region:rollup2
WITH A FRESH SET OF EYES. AND

01:38:49.891 --> 01:38:53.261 region:rollup2
I'M.

01:38:50.558 --> 01:38:53.828 region:rollup2
AND.

01:38:53.261 --> 01:38:55.630 region:rollup2
WE WILL DO THE ON PAGE PAGE

01:38:53.828 --> 01:38:57.331 region:rollup2
SIXTY.

01:38:55.630 --> 01:38:59.100 region:rollup2
EW R. WAS LARGELY IN A MODE TO

01:38:57.331 --> 01:39:00.468 region:rollup2
REACT TO PROBLEMS.

01:38:59.100 --> 01:39:02.336 region:rollup2
WITHITS STATE WATER PROJECT

01:39:00.468 --> 01:39:04.038 region:rollup2
CIVIL INFRASTRUCTURE.

01:39:02.336 --> 01:39:04.939 region:rollup2
AT AS THEY AROSE IN THE SHORT

01:39:04.038 --> 01:39:06.440 region:rollup2
TERM RATHER THAN TAKING

01:39:04.939 --> 01:39:08.910 region:rollup2
PREEMPTIVE ACTIONS PROACTIVELY

01:39:06.440 --> 01:39:14.215 region:rollup2
TO PREVENT THE PROBLEMS.

01:39:08.910 --> 01:39:15.149 region:rollup2
DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT FINDING.

01:39:14.215 --> 01:39:16.384 region:rollup2
YOU MIND IF I PUMP THIS ONE TWO

01:39:15.149 --> 01:39:17.418 region:rollup2
YEARS.

01:39:16.384 --> 01:39:19.587 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THAT COMPREHENSIVE

01:39:17.418 --> 01:39:20.988 region:rollup2
NEEDS ASSESSMENT OF.

01:39:19.587 --> 01:39:21.956 region:rollup2
PUT THIS ON OVER TO JOLT JUST

01:39:20.988 --> 01:39:23.391 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I THINKING GIVING HIM

01:39:21.956 --> 01:39:25.026 region:rollup2
MORE IN DEPTH ANSWER REACTIVE

01:39:23.391 --> 01:39:27.595 region:rollup2
RATHER THAN PROACTIVE THAT'S A

01:39:25.026 --> 01:39:29.330 region:rollup2
CLAIM IN THE REPORT RIGHT.

01:39:27.595 --> 01:39:30.932 region:rollup2
DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT.

01:39:29.330 --> 01:39:32.700 region:rollup2
NO BUT GOING BACK TO YOUR OTHER

01:39:30.932 --> 01:39:33.434 region:rollup2
QUESTION JUST ADD A LITTLE BIT I

01:39:32.700 --> 01:39:35.403 region:rollup2
I WANT TO REALLY LEVERAGE

01:39:33.434 --> 01:39:37.472 region:rollup2
THE.

01:39:35.403 --> 01:39:39.140 region:rollup2
THE A FORENSICS REPORT LESSONS

01:39:37.472 --> 01:39:41.676 region:rollup2
LEARNED ON THE PROBABLE FAILURE

01:39:39.140 --> 01:39:43.578 region:rollup2
MODES ANALYSIS BECAUSE.

01:39:41.676 --> 01:39:46.814 region:rollup2
FUNDAMENTALLY THAT IS THE

01:39:43.578 --> 01:39:49.016 region:rollup2
BEGINNING. AND SETS REALLY THE

01:39:46.814 --> 01:39:50.685 region:rollup2
OBJECTIVE FOR. WHAT YEAR

01:39:49.016 --> 01:39:52.420 region:rollup2
PROTECTING FROM?

01:39:50.685 --> 01:39:54.589 region:rollup2
AND IF CURRENTLY WERE PROTECTING

01:39:52.420 --> 01:39:57.258 region:rollup2
FROM A FULL DAM FAILURE.

01:39:54.589 --> 01:39:58.759 region:rollup2
THEN THAT DOES.

01:39:57.258 --> 01:40:01.429 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW COULD. REALLY TAKE AWAY

01:39:58.759 --> 01:40:03.197 region:rollup2
ALL THOSE OTHER FAILURES THAT

01:40:01.429 --> 01:40:04.632 region:rollup2
HAVE COME AND DON'T MEAN NOT A

01:40:03.197 --> 01:40:06.901 region:rollup2
FULL DAM FAILURE BUT STILL ENDS

01:40:04.632 --> 01:40:07.502 region:rollup2
UP BEING AND IT'S.

01:40:06.901 --> 01:40:09.136 region:rollup2
OR NUMBERS SEE WHAT I WANT TO

01:40:07.502 --> 01:40:11.873 region:rollup2
GET TOO SO I THINK FUNDAMENTALLY

01:40:09.136 --> 01:40:13.741 region:rollup2
WE HAVE TO CHANGE THAT THINKING.

01:40:11.873 --> 01:40:14.375 region:rollup2
WHICH THEN PULLS YOU INTO NOW

01:40:13.741 --> 01:40:15.309 region:rollup2
YOU'RE LOOKING AT EVERY

01:40:14.375 --> 01:40:16.944 region:rollup2
COMPONENT OF THIS OF THE OF THE

01:40:15.309 --> 01:40:19.547 region:rollup2
SYSTEM.

01:40:16.944 --> 01:40:22.116 region:rollup2
ON THE ONTHE BEING REACTIVE OR

01:40:19.547 --> 01:40:23.551 region:rollup2
NOT. I THINK THE DEPARTMENT.

01:40:22.116 --> 01:40:24.952 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IN TWO THOUSAND EVEN IN

01:40:23.551 --> 01:40:26.721 region:rollup2
TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN STARTED

01:40:24.952 --> 01:40:29.123 region:rollup2
UPGRADING OUR ASSET MANAGEMENT

01:40:26.721 --> 01:40:30.558 region:rollup2
PROGRAM TO REALLY LOOK AT. EVERY

01:40:29.123 --> 01:40:33.961 region:rollup2
ASSET

01:40:30.558 --> 01:40:35.763 region:rollup2
FROM MY RISK PUBLIC SAFETY TWO

01:40:33.961 --> 01:40:36.731 region:rollup2
EVEN TO THE BUSINESS PROCESS

01:40:35.763 --> 01:40:38.199 region:rollup2
ABOUT.

01:40:36.731 --> 01:40:39.734 region:rollup2
DELIVERING WATER IN IN THE

01:40:38.199 --> 01:40:41.602 region:rollup2
REPORTED DOES SAY WE NEED TO

01:40:39.734 --> 01:40:43.137 region:rollup2
CONTINUE LEVERAGE THAT'S I THINK

01:40:41.602 --> 01:40:44.805 region:rollup2
THAT'S SOMETHING WE IT STARTED

01:40:43.137 --> 01:40:46.741 region:rollup2
IT'S A FIVE YEAR PROJECT WE'RE

01:40:44.805 --> 01:40:49.577 region:rollup2
NOT COMPLETELY THERE YET. BUT I

01:40:46.741 --> 01:40:52.313 region:rollup2
THINK THAT WAS VERY PROACTIVE OF

01:40:49.577 --> 01:40:54.782 region:rollup2
PARIS DAM THE DEPARTMENT TOOK ON

01:40:52.313 --> 01:40:55.550 region:rollup2
ON ITS OWN THAT PROJECT TO

01:40:54.782 --> 01:40:57.184 region:rollup2
REALLY.

01:40:55.550 --> 01:40:59.186 region:rollup2
BOLSTER IT FROM FROM THE

01:40:57.184 --> 01:41:01.522 region:rollup2
SEISMIC PERSPECTIVE AND WE WERE

01:40:59.186 --> 01:41:03.257 region:rollup2
NOT TOLD BY FOR COR DS SO NEED

01:41:01.522 --> 01:41:04.625 region:rollup2
TO DO THAT THAT WAS ON OUR OWN

01:41:03.257 --> 01:41:07.295 region:rollup2
AND THAT WAS A VERY EXPENSIVE.

01:41:04.625 --> 01:41:09.397 region:rollup2
PROJECT BUT IT'S THINGS LIKE

01:41:07.295 --> 01:41:11.832 region:rollup2
THAT THAT WE'RE CONTINUING TO DO

01:41:09.397 --> 01:41:13.067 region:rollup2
SO I SEE OURSELVES AS A.

01:41:11.832 --> 01:41:15.136 region:rollup2
PROACTIVE ORGANIZATION BUT I CAN

01:41:13.067 --> 01:41:16.938 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND FROM THE INFORMATION

01:41:15.136 --> 01:41:18.773 region:rollup2
THE FORENSICS TEAM HAD AND WHAT

01:41:16.938 --> 01:41:20.207 region:rollup2
HAPPENED HERE. THAT YEAH THERE

01:41:18.773 --> 01:41:22.043 region:rollup2
SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE DONE ON

01:41:20.207 --> 01:41:23.377 region:rollup2
THAT SPILLWAYS IF WE HAD BEEN

01:41:22.043 --> 01:41:24.912 region:rollup2
ABLE IF WE HAD DONE THE

01:41:23.377 --> 01:41:26.280 region:rollup2
INSPECTIONS THAT THEY INDUSTRY

01:41:24.912 --> 01:41:28.416 region:rollup2
IS LEARNING FROM AND WOULD HAVE

01:41:26.280 --> 01:41:29.550 region:rollup2
DONE SO.

01:41:28.416 --> 01:41:30.251 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THAT'S NOW AT LEAST IN

01:41:29.550 --> 01:41:32.653 region:rollup2
MY OPINION. THE.

01:41:30.251 --> 01:41:33.654 region:rollup2
.

01:41:32.653 --> 01:41:34.755 region:rollup2
THERE'S A CONVERSATION HERE FROM

01:41:33.654 --> 01:41:35.856 region:rollup2

BUREAUCRACIES.

01:41:50.171 --> 01:41:53.207 region:rollup2
IT IS ALMOST THE NATURE OF

01:41:51.005 --> 01:41:54.775 region:rollup2

ASSESSMENT WITH A RISK

01:43:32.640 --> 01:43:36.210 region:rollup2
ASSESSMENT.

01:43:34.175 --> 01:43:37.678 region:rollup2
MOVING THAT INTO IMPLEMENTATION

01:43:36.210 --> 01:43:40.548 region:rollup2
PHASE

01:43:37.678 --> 01:43:42.383 region:rollup2
I KNOW WE CAN GET THERE BUT.

01:43:40.548 --> 01:43:43.617 region:rollup2
I SPEND HOURS AT NIGHT.

01:43:42.383 --> 01:43:45.152 region:rollup2

THAT WE CAN'T MAKE THESE CHANGES

01:43:54.695 --> 01:43:56.997 region:rollup2
AND BE ACCOUNTABLE BUT.

01:43:56.397 --> 01:43:59.200 region:rollup2
WE ARE A BIG DEPARTMENT THERE

01:43:56.997 --> 01:44:01.635 region:rollup2
IS.

01:43:59.200 --> 01:44:03.804 region:rollup2
A LOT OF WORK TO DO HERE AND HOW

01:44:01.635 --> 01:44:05.339 region:rollup2
I AM VERY DEDICATED AS IS THE

01:44:03.804 --> 01:44:07.074 region:rollup2

THERE YOU KNOW JUST MAKING THIS

01:44:07.074 --> 01:44:10.811 region:rollup2
WEEK IS.

01:44:08.943 --> 01:44:11.378 region:rollup2
GONNA BE A HECK OF A LOT OF WORK

01:44:10.811 --> 01:44:12.813 region:rollup2
ONE FINAL QUESTION MR FRANCE

01:44:11.378 --> 01:44:14.215 region:rollup2
THE.

01:44:12.813 --> 01:44:15.916 region:rollup2
STATE WATER PROJECT IS UNIQUE IN

01:44:14.215 --> 01:44:16.484 region:rollup2
THAT THE W. OUR FUNCTION

01:44:15.916 --> 01:44:18.619 region:rollup2
AS AS BOTH THE OWNER IN THE

01:44:16.484 --> 01:44:19.920 region:rollup2
REGULAR.

01:44:18.619 --> 01:44:21.789 region:rollup2
I CONSIDERING THE W. ARE

01:44:19.920 --> 01:44:23.457 region:rollup2
SUBSTANTIAL RESPONSIBILITY OF

01:44:21.789 --> 01:44:24.892 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONAL COMPLEXITY.

01:44:23.457 --> 01:44:26.494 region:rollup2
THEN YOU BELIEVE THAT IT WOULD

01:44:24.892 --> 01:44:29.230 region:rollup2
BE HELPFUL TO HAVE ANOTHER

01:44:26.494 --> 01:44:30.931 region:rollup2
ENTITY ASSIST WITH OPERATIONS OF

01:44:29.230 --> 01:44:33.100 region:rollup2
THE STATE WATER. PROJECTS

01:44:30.931 --> 01:44:34.668 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY THE.

01:44:33.100 --> 01:44:35.569 region:rollup2
ORAL VILLE FACILITIES AND DO YOU

01:44:34.668 --> 01:44:37.037 region:rollup2
BELIEVE THAT THE DIVISION OF

01:44:35.569 --> 01:44:40.708 region:rollup2
SAFETY AND DAM SHOULD REMAIN

01:44:37.037 --> 01:44:42.009 region:rollup2
UNDER THE W. ARE.

01:44:40.708 --> 01:44:43.244 region:rollup2
YES IT IS RICOCHET DO OF THE

01:44:42.009 --> 01:44:44.545 region:rollup2
SITUATION WHERE THE THE ONE

01:44:43.244 --> 01:44:46.514 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT HAS BOTH THE

01:44:44.545 --> 01:44:47.915 region:rollup2
REGULATOR AND DAM OWNER.

01:44:46.514 --> 01:44:48.749 region:rollup2
AYE I WOULD COMMITTEES NOT

01:44:47.915 --> 01:44:50.551 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY UNIQUE.

01:44:48.749 --> 01:44:51.619 region:rollup2
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF OTHER

01:44:50.551 --> 01:44:53.187 region:rollup2
STATES WHERE EXACTLY THE SAME

01:44:51.619 --> 01:44:54.355 region:rollup2
SITUATION EXISTS IN MY HOME

01:44:53.187 --> 01:44:56.657 region:rollup2
STATE OF COLORADO.

01:44:54.355 --> 01:44:58.292 region:rollup2
THE SAME SITUATION EXISTS

01:44:56.657 --> 01:44:59.093 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT NATURAL RESOURCES.

01:44:58.292 --> 01:45:01.796 region:rollup2
HOUSES THE.

01:44:59.093 --> 01:45:03.364 region:rollup2
THE DAM SAFETY PROGRAM AND IT

01:45:01.796 --> 01:45:04.932 region:rollup2
ALSO HOUSES THE PARKS AND

01:45:03.364 --> 01:45:06.767 region:rollup2
WILDLIFE DEPARTMENT WHICH OWNS

01:45:04.932 --> 01:45:08.402 region:rollup2
DAMS THAT ARE REGULATED BY THAT

01:45:06.767 --> 01:45:09.870 region:rollup2
GROUP I BELIEVE IN MEXICO'S THE

01:45:08.402 --> 01:45:11.038 region:rollup2
SAME WAY I THINK YOU'LL FIND

01:45:09.870 --> 01:45:12.706 region:rollup2
MULTIPLE STATES ACROSS THE

01:45:11.038 --> 01:45:14.341 region:rollup2
COUNTRY IT IS SAME WAY. I DON'T

01:45:12.706 --> 01:45:16.210 region:rollup2
THINK THAT'S AN INHERENT FLAW I

01:45:14.341 --> 01:45:18.746 region:rollup2
THINK THOSE ORGANIZATIONS WORK

01:45:16.210 --> 01:45:22.316 region:rollup2
VERY WELL. IT DOES RELY ON

01:45:18.746 --> 01:45:24.685 region:rollup2
KEEPING THAT REGULATOR.

01:45:22.316 --> 01:45:27.354 region:rollup2
KEEPING SEPARATION PUNIT

01:45:24.685 --> 01:45:30.925 region:rollup2
REGULATOR AND THE OWNER.

01:45:27.354 --> 01:45:33.260 region:rollup2
AND WE DID WE'VE BELIEVE FROM

01:45:30.925 --> 01:45:35.896 region:rollup2
WHAT THE DISCUSSIONS WE'VE HAD

01:45:33.260 --> 01:45:38.566 region:rollup2
AND WE SAW IS THAT. THAT'S

01:45:35.896 --> 01:45:42.870 region:rollup2
REALLY NOT A FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM

01:45:38.566 --> 01:45:46.273 region:rollup2
HERE DSO DE IS NOT EASIER ON D.

01:45:42.870 --> 01:45:47.107 region:rollup2
W. ARE THAT IS ON ON ITS OTHER

01:45:46.273 --> 01:45:48.209 region:rollup2
OWNERS.

01:45:47.107 --> 01:45:49.510 region:rollup2
IN IN FACT IF ANYTHING WE

01:45:48.209 --> 01:45:51.145 region:rollup2
PERHAPS A LITTLE BIT OF OF

01:45:49.510 --> 01:45:52.513 region:rollup2
EVIDENCE THAT SUGGESTED DSO DE

01:45:51.145 --> 01:45:53.914 region:rollup2
MIGHT BE EVEN A LITTLE HARDER ON

01:45:52.513 --> 01:45:55.182 region:rollup2
D. W. ARTISTS OCCUR COMPENSATE

01:45:53.914 --> 01:45:56.584 region:rollup2
FOR THAT SITUATION SO. THAT

01:45:55.182 --> 01:45:57.284 region:rollup2
THERE ARE OTHER MODELS AND NOT

01:45:56.584 --> 01:45:57.885 region:rollup2
SAYING THATTHE THERE'S NOT

01:45:57.284 --> 01:45:59.420 region:rollup2
REASON TO THINK ABOUT ANOTHER

01:45:57.885 --> 01:46:00.354 region:rollup2
MODEL BUT IT'S NOT UNIQUE IT'S

01:45:59.420 --> 01:46:01.555 region:rollup2
NOT TO BE A FATAL FLAW IT

01:46:00.354 --> 01:46:02.923 region:rollup2
DEPENDS ON THE DEDICATION OF THE

01:46:01.555 --> 01:46:03.891 region:rollup2
DAM SAFETY OF THE PEOPLE IN THE

01:46:02.923 --> 01:46:04.992 region:rollup2
DAM SAFETY DIVISION AND. I THINK

01:46:03.891 --> 01:46:06.360 region:rollup2
YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF GOOD

01:46:04.992 --> 01:46:08.796 region:rollup2
DEDICATED PEOPLE HERE AND THAT'S

01:46:06.360 --> 01:46:10.998 region:rollup2
HOW I DON'T SEE THAT. UP I'LL

01:46:08.796 --> 01:46:12.466 region:rollup2
JUST CONCLUDE WE EAT.

01:46:10.998 --> 01:46:14.001 region:rollup2
WE HEARD THE A WORD ABOUT WE ARE

01:46:12.466 --> 01:46:15.269 region:rollup2
FORTUNATE THAT.

01:46:14.001 --> 01:46:16.136 region:rollup2
LIVES WERE NOT LOST.

01:46:15.269 --> 01:46:17.004 region:rollup2
SEEMS TO ME THAT WE WERE MORE

01:46:16.136 --> 01:46:18.138 region:rollup2
LUCKY THAN GOOD.

01:46:17.004 --> 01:46:19.240 region:rollup2
AND IT SEEMS THAT IT'S ABOUT

01:46:18.138 --> 01:46:20.207 region:rollup2
TIME FOR US NOT TO DEPEND ON

01:46:19.240 --> 01:46:20.774 region:rollup2
BLOCK SO MUCH.

01:46:20.207 --> 01:46:24.645 region:rollup2
TO GET A WHOLE LOT BETTER AT

01:46:20.774 --> 01:46:25.813 region:rollup2
WHAT.

01:46:24.645 --> 01:46:28.315 region:rollup2
THINK MISTER PATTERSON ALMOST

01:46:25.813 --> 01:46:29.783 region:rollup2
FRAZIER.

01:46:28.315 --> 01:46:31.919 region:rollup2

HAS BEEN.

01:46:32.186 --> 01:46:37.591 region:rollup2
DISCUSSED.

01:46:34.588 --> 01:46:39.693 region:rollup2
VERY ON A VERY SMALL SCALE. WHOM

01:46:37.591 --> 01:46:40.561 region:rollup2
WE HAD LOMA PRIETA IN CALIFORNIA

01:46:39.693 --> 01:46:41.862 region:rollup2
WE WENT THROUGH IN REEF

01:46:40.561 --> 01:46:43.731 region:rollup2
RETROFITTED ALL THE BRIDGES IN

01:46:41.862 --> 01:46:45.132 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA AND EX A COST.

01:46:43.731 --> 01:46:47.101 region:rollup2
IT WAS ENORMOUS.

01:46:45.132 --> 01:46:48.636 region:rollup2
BUT THERE WAS NO.

01:46:47.101 --> 01:46:50.104 region:rollup2
EXPENSE SPARED BECAUSE.

01:46:48.636 --> 01:46:52.206 region:rollup2
OF THE SAFETY.

01:46:50.104 --> 01:46:54.375 region:rollup2
THAT IT AFFORDED.

01:46:52.206 --> 01:46:55.709 region:rollup2

.

01:47:01.916 --> 01:47:04.885 region:rollup2
BECAUSE CONCRETE DOES HAVE A

01:47:02.883 --> 01:47:06.854 region:rollup2
LIFESPAN.

01:47:04.885 --> 01:47:07.955 region:rollup2

01:49:42.075 --> 01:49:46.113 region:rollup2
THE DEPARTMENT HAS A DAMN OWNER

01:49:43.577 --> 01:49:48.515 region:rollup2
AS MANY OTHER DAM OWNERS DO.

01:49:46.113 --> 01:49:50.851 region:rollup2
THEY ARE. WRITTEN DOWN THEY'VE

01:49:48.515 --> 01:49:52.853 region:rollup2
BEEN FOLLOWED WE.

01:49:50.851 --> 01:49:55.856 region:rollup2
WHO OVER THE ENTIRE?

01:49:52.853 --> 01:49:57.324 region:rollup2
HISTORY YEAR LIFESPAN OF THE DAM

01:49:55.856 --> 01:49:59.326 region:rollup2
AND OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE WE HAVE

01:49:57.324 --> 01:50:01.562 region:rollup2
DONE OUR ANNUAL INSPECTIONS ARE

01:49:59.326 --> 01:50:02.396 region:rollup2
EVERY TWO YEAR INSPECTIONS ARE

01:50:01.562 --> 01:50:04.331 region:rollup2
FIVE YEAR INSPECTION SO THESE

01:50:02.396 --> 01:50:07.835 region:rollup2
ARE. LAID OUT BY THE DIFFERENT

01:50:04.331 --> 01:50:09.570 region:rollup2
REGULATORY ENTITIES WE HAVE OUR

01:50:07.835 --> 01:50:11.071 region:rollup2
STAFF THAT

01:50:09.570 --> 01:50:12.306 region:rollup2
OR TRAINED.

01:50:11.071 --> 01:50:14.308 region:rollup2
IN THESE AREAS OF DAM SAFETY

01:50:12.306 --> 01:50:15.943 region:rollup2
AND.

01:50:14.308 --> 01:50:18.278 region:rollup2
FIELDS OF ENGINEERING BUT WE

01:50:15.943 --> 01:50:19.580 region:rollup2
ALSO UTILIZE A LOT OF OUTSIDE

01:50:18.278 --> 01:50:21.915 region:rollup2
EXPERTISE IN TERMS OF

01:50:19.580 --> 01:50:23.884 region:rollup2
CONSULTANTS THAT ARE EXPERTS IN

01:50:21.915 --> 01:50:24.985 region:rollup2
THESE FIELDS SO.

01:50:23.884 --> 01:50:26.720 region:rollup2
WE DO HAVE OUR OUR FOLKS THERE

01:50:24.985 --> 01:50:28.655 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY.

01:50:26.720 --> 01:50:30.390 region:rollup2
MS TURNOVER IN STAFF BUT THE

01:50:28.655 --> 01:50:32.860 region:rollup2
FRAMEWORK IS THERE BY WHICH WE

01:50:30.390 --> 01:50:34.061 region:rollup2
OPERATE UNDER IN REPORT OUT

01:50:32.860 --> 01:50:36.630 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE HAND SO IT'S IT'S

01:50:34.061 --> 01:50:39.299 region:rollup2
BEYOND.

01:50:36.630 --> 01:50:42.269 region:rollup2
JUST DWI R..

01:50:39.299 --> 01:50:43.937 region:rollup2
TIGHTEN UP THAT.

01:50:42.269 --> 01:50:45.639 region:rollup2
GOING TO GET HIM HOME LOOKING

01:50:43.937 --> 01:50:46.673 region:rollup2
FOR BECAUSE IF THE PROTOCOLS ARE

01:50:45.639 --> 01:50:48.642 region:rollup2
IN PLACE.

01:50:46.673 --> 01:50:50.310 region:rollup2
WE HAD A MASSIVE FAILURE BECAUSE

01:50:48.642 --> 01:50:52.746 region:rollup2
PARTICLES PART FOLLOWED IN SOME

01:50:50.310 --> 01:50:53.380 region:rollup2
FORM OF RESPECT OF THE REPAIRS.

01:50:52.746 --> 01:50:54.214 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE REPAIRS WERE DONE IN

01:50:53.380 --> 01:50:56.283 region:rollup2
THE APPROPRIATE FASHION.

01:50:54.214 --> 01:50:58.352 region:rollup2
IN THE WASN'T INTRUSION PIMP.

01:50:56.283 --> 01:51:00.087 region:rollup2
I'M SAYING POSSIBLY.

01:50:58.352 --> 01:51:03.557 region:rollup2
THE

01:51:00.087 --> 01:51:06.126 region:rollup2
FAILURE MAY HAVE BEEN MINIMIZED.

01:51:03.557 --> 01:51:07.694 region:rollup2
SO COULD WE SHOULD WRITE BUT.

01:51:06.126 --> 01:51:10.297 region:rollup2
WE DIDN'T DO THINGS

01:51:07.694 --> 01:51:11.098 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATELY IN.

01:51:10.297 --> 01:51:12.1000 region:rollup2
AND CONCRETE I MEAN THERE'S

01:51:11.098 --> 01:51:13.867 region:rollup2
THREE THINGS IN LIFE DEATH TAXES

01:51:12.1000 --> 01:51:16.069 region:rollup2
IN CONCRETE CRACKS OKAY.

01:51:13.867 --> 01:51:16.603 region:rollup2
GUARANTEED.

01:51:16.069 --> 01:51:18.705 region:rollup2
I'M WILL TALK WITH THE NEW

01:51:16.603 --> 01:51:20.674 region:rollup2
PANEL.

01:51:18.705 --> 01:51:22.276 region:rollup2
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE COULD

01:51:20.674 --> 01:51:25.145 region:rollup2
CRACK CRACK OF CONCRETE AND IN

01:51:22.276 --> 01:51:25.579 region:rollup2
THE UP. THE NEW SPILLING HER IN

01:51:25.145 --> 01:51:27.414 region:rollup2
THE IN THE CURRENT.

01:51:25.579 --> 01:51:27.915 region:rollup2
OF.

01:51:27.414 --> 01:51:28.715 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT.

01:51:27.915 --> 01:51:30.517 region:rollup2
.

01:51:28.715 --> 01:51:33.987 region:rollup2
I'M I'M.

01:51:30.517 --> 01:51:35.756 region:rollup2
CONCERNED ABOUT IS THAT.

01:51:33.987 --> 01:51:37.824 region:rollup2
THERE IS NO. CONSISTENCY.

01:51:35.756 --> 01:51:39.560 region:rollup2
IN.

01:51:37.824 --> 01:51:42.296 region:rollup2
GOING OUT IN NUMBERS ACCOUNTABLE

01:51:39.560 --> 01:51:43.697 region:rollup2
HIS AS. I MEAN.

01:51:42.296 --> 01:51:45.465 region:rollup2
WHAT HAPPENS IF THEY DON'T DO IT

01:51:43.697 --> 01:51:47.134 region:rollup2
RIGHT ONLY ONE THAT PAYS FOR THE

01:51:45.465 --> 01:51:49.536 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL REPAIRS ARE THEY ARE

01:51:47.134 --> 01:51:51.371 region:rollup2
THE FAILURE IS THE TAXPAYER?

01:51:49.536 --> 01:51:52.039 region:rollup2
THE AGENCY JUST CLOSE MY EYES AS

01:51:51.371 --> 01:51:53.774 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO DO WE NEED TO FIX IT.

01:51:52.039 --> 01:51:55.542 region:rollup2
.

01:51:53.774 --> 01:51:56.877 region:rollup2
SOMEONE LOOKING FOR.

01:51:55.542 --> 01:51:58.345 region:rollup2
IN THIS PROCESS.

01:51:56.877 --> 01:52:00.781 region:rollup2
THAT

01:51:58.345 --> 01:52:02.583 region:rollup2
THERE'S MORE THAN.

01:52:00.781 --> 01:52:04.985 region:rollup2
AND I THINK IT WAS. TOUCHED ON

01:52:02.583 --> 01:52:06.553 region:rollup2
BY MISTER PATTERSON.

01:52:04.985 --> 01:52:10.290 region:rollup2
SEPARATION OF CHURCH AND STATE

01:52:06.553 --> 01:52:11.191 region:rollup2
ONE COMES TO FOLLOW UP AND THAT

01:52:10.290 --> 01:52:11.758 region:rollup2
THEY DID TO REPAIRS WERE DONE

01:52:11.191 --> 01:52:12.693 region:rollup2
ACCORDANCE TO.

01:52:11.758 --> 01:52:14.728 region:rollup2
STRINGENT GUIDELINES.

01:52:12.693 --> 01:52:18.265 region:rollup2
.

01:52:14.728 --> 01:52:20.334 region:rollup2
AND THAT WE GO FORWARD. AND KNOW

01:52:18.265 --> 01:52:22.536 region:rollup2
THE FACT IS WE'RE GOING IN TO DO

01:52:20.334 --> 01:52:25.472 region:rollup2
EXACTLY WHAT IS NECESSARY TO

01:52:22.536 --> 01:52:26.807 region:rollup2
PREVENT FUTURE. DEGRADATION OF

01:52:25.472 --> 01:52:30.577 region:rollup2
THE CONCRETE A REBAR WHATEVER

01:52:26.807 --> 01:52:32.946 region:rollup2
GOING FOR. SO HOW DO YOU.

01:52:30.577 --> 01:52:35.048 region:rollup2
HOW DOES HE W. OR LOOK AT THAT?

01:52:32.946 --> 01:52:36.750 region:rollup2
ON.

01:52:35.048 --> 01:52:39.586 region:rollup2
GOING FORWARD I MEAN. DIDN'T DO

01:52:36.750 --> 01:52:41.622 region:rollup2
YOU GUYS HAVE A PLAN. HARD TO

01:52:39.586 --> 01:52:42.189 region:rollup2
PUT THAT THAT UP BOUNCING CHECKS

01:52:41.622 --> 01:52:45.392 region:rollup2
AND BECAUSE IT WASN'T THERE

01:52:42.189 --> 01:52:48.362 region:rollup2
BEFORE.

01:52:45.392 --> 01:52:50.497 region:rollup2
I THINK. SO. I BELIEVE WE DO I

01:52:48.362 --> 01:52:51.865 region:rollup2
MEAN THE FORENSICS REPORT KIND

01:52:50.497 --> 01:52:53.200 region:rollup2
OF LAYS OUT THE LESSONS LEARNED

01:52:51.865 --> 01:52:55.302 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE TO INCORPORATE

01:52:53.200 --> 01:52:56.103 region:rollup2
THERE'S NO.

01:52:55.302 --> 01:52:57.804 region:rollup2
YEAH AND IF SOMEBODY'S WE

01:52:56.103 --> 01:52:59.473 region:rollup2
HAVEN'T INCORPORATED WE HAVE

ALREADY USE PULL THEM ALL

01:53:29.002 --> 01:53:32.372 region:rollup2
TOGETHER TO COME UP WITH. WHAT

01:53:30.904 --> 01:53:34.274 region:rollup2
SHOULD OUR LOOK LIKE?

01:53:32.372 --> 01:53:36.910 region:rollup2
WHAT'S EXPERTISE THAT WE EITHER

01:53:34.274 --> 01:53:38.712 region:rollup2
HAVE DON'T HAVE OR NEED MORE.

01:53:36.910 --> 01:53:40.247 region:rollup2
AND WHAT'S THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF

COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENT SO.

01:53:43.417 --> 01:53:46.753 region:rollup2
THAT INITIATIVE.

01:53:45.185 --> 01:53:47.921 region:rollup2
IS WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT THAT

01:53:46.753 --> 01:53:49.856 region:rollup2
WILL KIND OF.

SPECIFICALLY THAT'S A TWO YEAR

01:54:31.565 --> 01:54:35.569 region:rollup2
ASSESSMENT OUT OF IT WILL COME.

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:37.637 region:rollup2
PROJECTS TO BUILD ANOTHER

01:54:35.569 --> 01:54:39.239 region:rollup2
SPILLWAY. WHAT DO WE DO WITH THE

ITSELF AND SO THOSE WILL BE OUR

01:54:43.510 --> 01:54:46.279 region:rollup2
ROADMAP ON NOT JUST WHAT WE DO

01:54:45.212 --> 01:54:48.382 region:rollup2
OR HELP CONSTRUCTION

01:54:46.279 --> 01:54:49.950 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE TO BUT MODERNIZE

DETERMINED THAT IT WASN'T

01:55:17.477 --> 01:55:19.679 region:rollup2
NECESSARY.

.

01:55:30.423 --> 01:55:34.761 region:rollup2
IN SOME OF THE. THINGS TO GO

01:55:32.592 --> 01:55:36.396 region:rollup2
FORWARD. BUT DO WE HAVE THAT

01:55:34.761 --> 01:55:38.999 region:rollup2
SITUATION IN OTHER.

01:55:36.396 --> 01:55:40.734 region:rollup2
DAMS IN CALIFORNIA.

01:55:38.999 --> 01:55:41.802 region:rollup2
OF THE WHERE YOU'VE MADE A

01:55:40.734 --> 01:55:43.270 region:rollup2
DETERMINATION WAS UNNECESSARY

01:55:41.802 --> 01:55:47.607 region:rollup2
AND THEN.

01:55:43.270 --> 01:55:48.708 region:rollup2
NOW YOU'RE AT RISK.

01:55:48.708 --> 01:55:50.610 region:rollup2
CAN.

01:55:50.310 --> 01:55:52.445 region:rollup2
AND AS WELL.

01:55:50.610 --> 01:55:55.081 region:rollup2
.

01:55:52.445 --> 01:55:56.516 region:rollup2
SO I JUST WANT TO ADD TO DOLE'S

01:55:55.081 --> 01:55:58.485 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION OF A COMPREHENSIVE

01:55:56.516 --> 01:55:59.986 region:rollup2
NEEDS ASSESSMENT OF IN TERMS OF

01:55:58.485 --> 01:56:02.222 region:rollup2
THE EMERGENCY SPILLWAY FOR

01:55:59.986 --> 01:56:04.591 region:rollup2
OROVILLE.

01:56:02.222 --> 01:56:06.059 region:rollup2
PART OF THE LIST OF

01:56:04.591 --> 01:56:07.928 region:rollup2
POSSIBLE ENHANCEMENTS THAT WILL

01:56:06.059 --> 01:56:09.296 region:rollup2
BE LOOKING AT.

01:56:07.928 --> 01:56:11.031 region:rollup2
WE WILL CIRCLE BACK TO THE

01:56:09.296 --> 01:56:12.132 region:rollup2
EMERGENCY SPILLWAY TO SEE BEYOND

01:56:11.031 --> 01:56:13.733 region:rollup2
THE CUT OFF WALL IN THE

01:56:12.132 --> 01:56:14.935 region:rollup2
IMMEDIATE ACTIVITIES.

01:56:13.733 --> 01:56:16.136 region:rollup2
WHAT MORE SHOULD WE BE THINKING

01:56:14.935 --> 01:56:17.838 region:rollup2
ABOUT DOING THERE SO WE'LL

01:56:16.136 --> 01:56:20.340 region:rollup2
CIRCLE BACK TO THAT PARTICULAR

01:56:17.838 --> 01:56:22.642 region:rollup2
ONE? IN TERMS OF OF OTHER

01:56:20.340 --> 01:56:24.878 region:rollup2
SPILLWAYS ARE OR DAM FACILITIES

01:56:22.642 --> 01:56:27.981 region:rollup2
IT MIGHT BE SIMILAR I AM I THINK

01:56:24.878 --> 01:56:29.616 region:rollup2
THAT WILL COME OUT OF THESE.

01:56:27.981 --> 01:56:31.918 region:rollup2
EVALUATIONS IT ARE BEING

01:56:29.616 --> 01:56:33.687 region:rollup2
CONDUCTED ON NUMEROUS OTHER DAMS

01:56:31.918 --> 01:56:34.688 region:rollup2
THAT ARE SIMILAR IN SIZE AGAIN

01:56:33.687 --> 01:56:37.190 region:rollup2
AND DESIGN IN AN AGE

01:56:34.688 --> 01:56:39.659 region:rollup2
SO THAT.

01:56:37.190 --> 01:56:41.928 region:rollup2
THIS REEVALUATION.

01:56:39.659 --> 01:56:43.463 region:rollup2
IDEA THAT'S.

01:56:41.928 --> 01:56:45.365 region:rollup2
CAPTURED THEN DESCRIBE IN THE.

01:56:43.463 --> 01:56:47.934 region:rollup2
PRINCE EIGHTEEN REPORT IS

01:56:45.365 --> 01:56:49.369 region:rollup2
REALLY I THINK THIS NEXT WEEK WE

01:56:47.934 --> 01:56:51.004 region:rollup2
STARTED TO DO THAT IT'S THE NEXT

01:56:49.369 --> 01:56:52.706 region:rollup2
NEXT BIG STEP THAT GIVES US

01:56:51.004 --> 01:56:54.507 region:rollup2
INFORMATION.

01:56:52.706 --> 01:56:55.842 region:rollup2
PROBLY BETTER INFORMATION TO

01:56:54.507 --> 01:56:57.444 region:rollup2
FIGURE OUT HOW WE MOVE AHEAD AND

01:56:55.842 --> 01:56:58.078 region:rollup2
WHAT SORT OF ENHANCEMENTS WE

01:56:57.444 --> 01:56:58.879 region:rollup2
MIGHT NEED TO BE THINKING ABOUT

01:56:58.078 --> 01:57:02.883 region:rollup2
IT THIS

01:56:58.879 --> 01:57:04.384 region:rollup2
THIS POINT THAT WE HADN'T.

01:57:02.883 --> 01:57:06.353 region:rollup2
I AM GOING TO GET TO THE NEXT

01:57:04.384 --> 01:57:07.087 region:rollup2
PANEL BUT I THINK. AND GET THE

01:57:06.353 --> 01:57:08.922 region:rollup2
QUESTION. OKAY.

01:57:07.087 --> 01:57:10.457 region:rollup2
.

01:57:08.922 --> 01:57:12.058 region:rollup2

ISSUES.

01:58:54.628 --> 01:58:57.497 region:rollup2
CAN THE OTHER QUESTION I HAD WAS

01:58:56.363 --> 01:58:59.132 region:rollup2
A I'M AWARE THAT TO MANY OF THE

01:58:57.497 --> 01:59:00.967 region:rollup2
EVACUEES HAVE SUBMITTED CLAIMS

01:58:59.132 --> 01:59:01.568 region:rollup2
FOR DAMAGES.

01:59:00.967 --> 01:59:03.003 region:rollup2
I THAT THEY'VE INCURRED AS A

01:59:01.568 --> 01:59:04.304 region:rollup2
RESULT OF THE EVACUATION

01:59:03.003 --> 01:59:05.505 region:rollup2
WHILE I KNOW THAT THE DEPARTMENT

01:59:04.304 --> 01:59:06.973 region:rollup2
GENERAL SERVICES IS HANDLING

01:59:05.505 --> 01:59:07.907 region:rollup2
THESE CLAIMS THE W. R. HAS

01:59:06.973 --> 01:59:09.676 region:rollup2
INDICATED THAT WOULD SUPPORT

01:59:07.907 --> 01:59:11.711 region:rollup2
LEGITIMATE CLAIMS.

01:59:09.676 --> 01:59:13.713 region:rollup2
THAT'S FAR EVERY CLAIM HAS BEEN

01:59:11.711 --> 01:59:14.414 region:rollup2
DENIED WHAT IS D. W. ARE.

01:59:13.713 --> 01:59:15.315 region:rollup2
DONE TO SUPPORT CLAIMS

01:59:14.414 --> 01:59:17.350 region:rollup2
BEING.

01:59:15.315 --> 01:59:19.686 region:rollup2
.

01:59:17.350 --> 01:59:21.554 region:rollup2
I DONE AS A RESULT.

01:59:19.686 --> 01:59:23.423 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S HOME.

01:59:21.554 --> 01:59:25.992 region:rollup2
THE TOUGH QUESTION JUST IN TERMS

01:59:23.423 --> 01:59:27.527 region:rollup2
OF THE G. D. GS AS ROLE IN THIS.

01:59:25.992 --> 01:59:29.963 region:rollup2

CLAIMS HAVE BEEN DENIED THERE

01:59:29.963 --> 01:59:34.134 region:rollup2
ALSO ARE.

01:59:31.731 --> 01:59:36.536 region:rollup2
A COUPLE OF CLASS ACTION SUITS

01:59:34.134 --> 01:59:37.837 region:rollup2

SPEAK TOO MUCH TO THIS

01:59:40.306 --> 01:59:47.814 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR TOPIC.

01:59:45.078 --> 01:59:49.182 region:rollup2
GALLAGHER BRIEFLY.

01:59:47.814 --> 01:59:50.984 region:rollup2
I THINK YOU MEANT CHAIR OF. THIS

01:59:49.182 --> 01:59:52.852 region:rollup2
IS SERIOUS BUSINESS YOU KNOW AND

01:59:50.984 --> 01:59:53.553 region:rollup2
AND I THINK ITS SERIOUS BUSINESS

01:59:52.852 --> 01:59:56.456 region:rollup2
FOR ALL OF US.

01:59:53.553 --> 01:59:57.490 region:rollup2
INSANE UP HERE BUT CERTAINLY.

01:59:56.456 --> 01:59:59.759 region:rollup2
FOR MYSELF.

01:59:57.490 --> 02:00:00.860 region:rollup2
HAVING BEEN AN EVACUEE MYSELF

01:59:59.759 --> 02:00:02.695 region:rollup2
MY FAMILY WAS AFFECTED BY THIS

02:00:00.860 --> 02:00:04.564 region:rollup2
INCIDENT.

02:00:02.695 --> 02:00:05.565 region:rollup2
MY CONSTITUENTS. HAVE BEEN

02:00:04.564 --> 02:00:07.267 region:rollup2
AFFECTED BY.

02:00:05.565 --> 02:00:09.002 region:rollup2
.

02:00:07.267 --> 02:00:09.769 region:rollup2
OVER THE YEARS YOU'RE NOT JUST

02:00:09.002 --> 02:00:12.572 region:rollup2
THIS INCIDENT.

02:00:09.769 --> 02:00:14.340 region:rollup2
BUT BY THE THINGS THAT HAVE

02:00:12.572 --> 02:00:17.610 region:rollup2
BEEN IDENTIFIED IN THIS REPORT.

02:00:14.340 --> 02:00:18.945 region:rollup2
SO. WHAT I'M REALLY LOOKING FOR

02:00:17.610 --> 02:00:21.915 region:rollup2
IS IS REALLY HEARING A FIRM

02:00:18.945 --> 02:00:23.583 region:rollup2
COMMITMENT OUT OF D. W. ARE? TO

02:00:21.915 --> 02:00:24.751 region:rollup2
ADDRESSING THE ISSUES THAT HAVE

02:00:23.583 --> 02:00:26.252 region:rollup2
BEEN BROUGHT UP IN THIS FRIENDS

02:00:24.751 --> 02:00:27.787 region:rollup2
IT REPORT AND I JUST WANNA

02:00:26.252 --> 02:00:29.122 region:rollup2
DETAIL.

02:00:27.787 --> 02:00:31.925 region:rollup2
VERY QUICKLY YOU NO. I THINK MR

02:00:29.122 --> 02:00:33.059 region:rollup2
FRANCE POINTED OUT TWO VERY BIG.

02:00:31.925 --> 02:00:35.095 region:rollup2
THERE'S THAT THINK THERE'S THREE

02:00:33.059 --> 02:00:37.097 region:rollup2
VERY FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN

02:00:35.095 --> 02:00:38.832 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONAL PROBLEMS.

02:00:37.097 --> 02:00:39.766 region:rollup2
THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED BY

02:00:38.832 --> 02:00:41.601 region:rollup2
THIS REPORT BUT THERE'S A LOT IN

02:00:39.766 --> 02:00:43.837 region:rollup2
HERE BUT.

02:00:41.601 --> 02:00:45.238 region:rollup2
THAT ONE IS THE GEOLOGY THE WHAT

02:00:43.837 --> 02:00:47.874 region:rollup2
WHAT MR FRANCE CALLED THE MIS

02:00:45.238 --> 02:00:49.275 region:rollup2
CHARACTERIZATION OF THE GEOLOGY.

02:00:47.874 --> 02:00:51.411 region:rollup2
I THINK IN THE REPORT IT BECAUSE

02:00:49.275 --> 02:00:52.846 region:rollup2
IT A MYTHOLOGY.

02:00:51.411 --> 02:00:54.881 region:rollup2
REGARDING THE GEOLOGY THERE WAS

02:00:52.846 --> 02:00:56.316 region:rollup2
A REPORT.

02:00:54.881 --> 02:00:58.318 region:rollup2
DONE WHEN THIS DAM WAS BUILT

02:00:56.316 --> 02:00:59.853 region:rollup2
THAT CLEARLY IDENTIFIED.

02:00:58.318 --> 02:01:02.222 region:rollup2
WHETHER GROK IN THE EMERGENCY

02:00:59.853 --> 02:01:04.023 region:rollup2
SPILLWAY HILLSIDE. AND WHERE THE

02:01:02.222 --> 02:01:05.859 region:rollup2
GATED SPILLWAY WAS DONE.

02:01:04.023 --> 02:01:07.994 region:rollup2
AND OVER TIME.

02:01:05.859 --> 02:01:11.064 region:rollup2
THIS VERY CLEARLY SHOWS IN THE

02:01:07.994 --> 02:01:12.665 region:rollup2
REPORT THAT THE ORGANIZATION.

02:01:11.064 --> 02:01:14.033 region:rollup2
AT SOME POINT CREATED THIS

02:01:12.665 --> 02:01:16.436 region:rollup2
MYTHOLOGY THAT WAS ALL COMPANY

02:01:14.033 --> 02:01:18.104 region:rollup2
ROCK AND THERE WERE NO PROBLEMS.

02:01:16.436 --> 02:01:18.872 region:rollup2
AND IN FACT IN RESPONSE TO WHAT

02:01:18.104 --> 02:01:20.340 region:rollup2
WAS BROUGHT UP DURING THE FIRST

02:01:18.872 --> 02:01:22.976 region:rollup2
PROCESS.

02:01:20.340 --> 02:01:24.711 region:rollup2
THAT WAS BOLDLY ASSERTED THAT NO

02:01:22.976 --> 02:01:26.446 region:rollup2
THIS IS COMPANY ARRIVED IN THE

02:01:24.711 --> 02:01:28.948 region:rollup2
EMERGENCY SPILLWAY.

02:01:26.446 --> 02:01:30.049 region:rollup2
AND THERE WON'T BE THE KIND OF

02:01:28.948 --> 02:01:31.851 region:rollup2
HAD CUTTING EROSION. OF THAT WE

02:01:30.049 --> 02:01:32.819 region:rollup2
SAW.

02:01:31.851 --> 02:01:35.054 region:rollup2
IN FEBRUARY TWO THOUSAND

02:01:32.819 --> 02:01:37.791 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN THAT WAS INCORRECT.

02:01:35.054 --> 02:01:38.324 region:rollup2
AND SO THAT'S A BIG.

02:01:37.791 --> 02:01:39.392 region:rollup2
THE A MONUMENTAL FAILURE I

02:01:38.324 --> 02:01:41.027 region:rollup2
WOULD.

02:01:39.392 --> 02:01:41.828 region:rollup2
I WOULD CALL IT. A OF THE

02:01:41.027 --> 02:01:44.497 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATION.

02:01:41.828 --> 02:01:46.332 region:rollup2
.

02:01:44.497 --> 02:01:47.333 region:rollup2
THERE WAS CLEARLY A DESIGN FLAW.

02:01:46.332 --> 02:01:48.868 region:rollup2
IN THE ORIGINAL DESIGN OF THE

02:01:47.333 --> 02:01:50.270 region:rollup2
SPILLWAY.

02:01:48.868 --> 02:01:52.539 region:rollup2
THAT NOT ONLY MR FRIENDS AND HIS

02:01:50.270 --> 02:01:54.507 region:rollup2
TEAM IDENTIFIED IN THE EMBEDDED

02:01:52.539 --> 02:01:56.209 region:rollup2
DRAINS AND NOT SUFFICIENT

02:01:54.507 --> 02:01:57.710 region:rollup2
THICKNESS CRACKING THAT SOON

02:01:56.209 --> 02:01:59.412 region:rollup2
APPEARED AFTER THE CONSTRUCTION

02:01:57.710 --> 02:02:01.414 region:rollup2
OF IT. BUT PRETTY MUCH EVERY

02:01:59.412 --> 02:02:03.416 region:rollup2
EXPERT THAT'S LOOKED AT THIS IS

02:02:01.414 --> 02:02:04.684 region:rollup2
SAID THAT DESIGN WAS FLAWED.

02:02:03.416 --> 02:02:06.519 region:rollup2
AND AT NO POINT IN THE LAST

02:02:04.684 --> 02:02:08.054 region:rollup2
FIFTY YEARS.

02:02:06.519 --> 02:02:09.389 region:rollup2
DID ANYBODY EVER GO BACK AND

02:02:08.054 --> 02:02:10.757 region:rollup2
LOOK AT THAT DESIGN AND SAY YOU

02:02:09.389 --> 02:02:11.824 region:rollup2
KNOW WE HAVE PROBLEMS HERE WE

02:02:10.757 --> 02:02:12.759 region:rollup2
HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT

02:02:11.824 --> 02:02:13.726 region:rollup2
THAT'S A MONUMENTAL

02:02:12.759 --> 02:02:15.829 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONAL.

02:02:13.726 --> 02:02:17.697 region:rollup2
FAILURE.

02:02:15.829 --> 02:02:19.432 region:rollup2
BUT WHAT I ALSO WANT TO GET TO

02:02:17.697 --> 02:02:21.501 region:rollup2
IS THIS VERY CLEAR FINDING.

02:02:19.432 --> 02:02:22.368 region:rollup2
AND.

02:02:21.501 --> 02:02:24.604 region:rollup2
IN THE HUMAN FACTORS FRAMEWORK

02:02:22.368 --> 02:02:27.207 region:rollup2
APPENDIX.

02:02:24.604 --> 02:02:29.776 region:rollup2
PAGE J. TEN.

02:02:27.207 --> 02:02:31.277 region:rollup2
THAT IS CLEARLY STATES DWI OR

02:02:29.776 --> 02:02:34.214 region:rollup2
DID NOT HAVE A SUFFICIENTLY

02:02:31.277 --> 02:02:35.915 region:rollup2
STRONG DAM SAFETY CULTURE.

02:02:34.214 --> 02:02:38.218 region:rollup2
AND DAM SAFETY DID NOT HAVE

02:02:35.915 --> 02:02:40.220 region:rollup2
ADEQUATE PRIORITY RELATIVE TO

02:02:38.218 --> 02:02:41.721 region:rollup2
NON SAFETY GOALS.

02:02:40.220 --> 02:02:43.056 region:rollup2
SUCH AS DELIVERING WATER.

02:02:41.721 --> 02:02:45.792 region:rollup2
GENERATING POWER

02:02:43.056 --> 02:02:47.327 region:rollup2
AND CONTROLLING COSTS.

02:02:45.792 --> 02:02:48.761 region:rollup2
AND IS SAID TO MR FRANCES OUT A

02:02:47.327 --> 02:02:50.063 region:rollup2
PRETTY CLEAR.

02:02:48.761 --> 02:02:51.197 region:rollup2
DEPICTION OF SOME OF THE HUMAN

02:02:50.063 --> 02:02:54.133 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONAL PROBLEMS THAT

02:02:51.197 --> 02:02:55.568 region:rollup2
WE'RE FACING HERE.

02:02:54.133 --> 02:02:57.770 region:rollup2
I THINK THERE'S ARE ALL CORRECT

02:02:55.568 --> 02:02:59.472 region:rollup2
DEPICTIONS INTERPRETATIONS OF

02:02:57.770 --> 02:03:01.207 region:rollup2
THE REPORT OKAY THANK YOU. AS A

02:02:59.472 --> 02:03:02.909 region:rollup2
NOW TO THE W. ARE WHAT I WANT TO

02:03:01.207 --> 02:03:05.178 region:rollup2
HEAR IS DO YOU AGREE.

02:03:02.909 --> 02:03:06.246 region:rollup2
WITH THESE FINDINGS.

02:03:05.178 --> 02:03:07.914 region:rollup2
OF THE INDEPENDENT FORENSIC

02:03:06.246 --> 02:03:10.683 region:rollup2
REPORT OF OF THESE FUNDAMENTAL

02:03:07.914 --> 02:03:11.818 region:rollup2
HUMAN ORGANIZATIONAL PROBLEMS.

02:03:10.683 --> 02:03:13.553 region:rollup2
AND I'M REALLY LOOKING FOR YES

02:03:11.818 --> 02:03:15.054 region:rollup2
OR NO ANSWER.

02:03:13.553 --> 02:03:16.923 region:rollup2
AND THE MUCH AND THE FOLLOW UP

02:03:15.054 --> 02:03:17.891 region:rollup2
AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW IS OKAY.

02:03:16.923 --> 02:03:19.726 region:rollup2
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO TO TO

02:03:17.891 --> 02:03:22.428 region:rollup2
ADDRESS?

02:03:19.726 --> 02:03:23.696 region:rollup2
THOSE VERY CLEAR.

02:03:22.428 --> 02:03:25.531 region:rollup2
PROBLEMS THAT HAVE BEEN SPELLED

02:03:23.696 --> 02:03:29.535 region:rollup2
OUT IN THIS INDEPENDENT THE

02:03:25.531 --> 02:03:31.104 region:rollup2
FORENSIC ANALYSIS.

02:03:29.535 --> 02:03:32.972 region:rollup2
I WISH I COULD GIVE YOU AYE YES

02:03:31.104 --> 02:03:36.276 region:rollup2
SERRANO I THINK MY ANSWER IS IN

02:03:32.972 --> 02:03:37.577 region:rollup2
PART WE AGREE I THINK THERE ARE.

02:03:36.276 --> 02:03:39.045 region:rollup2
SOME STATEMENTS IN THE FRIENDS

02:03:37.577 --> 02:03:40.313 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN REPORT THAT WE DON'T

02:03:39.045 --> 02:03:42.081 region:rollup2
COMPLETELY AGREE WITH AT THIS

02:03:40.313 --> 02:03:45.418 region:rollup2
POINT.

02:03:42.081 --> 02:03:47.787 region:rollup2
BUT I CAN SAY THAT YES MOVING

02:03:45.418 --> 02:03:50.023 region:rollup2
FORWARD WE ARE COMMITTED TO

02:03:47.787 --> 02:03:51.257 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT FOR EXAMPLE AS WE'VE

02:03:50.023 --> 02:03:52.892 region:rollup2
BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE FULL

02:03:51.257 --> 02:03:55.495 region:rollup2
REEVALUATION.

02:03:52.892 --> 02:03:57.864 region:rollup2
UP OF THE SPILLWAY.

02:03:55.495 --> 02:03:59.899 region:rollup2
THE OTHER ASSOCIATED STRUCTURES

02:03:57.864 --> 02:04:01.634 region:rollup2
APPLYING IT TO OUR FACILITIES

02:03:59.899 --> 02:04:03.403 region:rollup2
ASKING OTHER DAM OWNERS TO ALSO

02:04:01.634 --> 02:04:04.904 region:rollup2
GO THROUGH THIS EXERCISE SO THAT

02:04:03.403 --> 02:04:07.340 region:rollup2
WE CAN.

02:04:04.904 --> 02:04:08.875 region:rollup2
MOVE FORWARD AND ADDRESS.

02:04:07.340 --> 02:04:09.709 region:rollup2
THE ISSUES AND HAVE THAT DATA

02:04:08.875 --> 02:04:12.745 region:rollup2
SAID.

02:04:09.709 --> 02:04:14.681 region:rollup2
BE.

02:04:12.745 --> 02:04:16.316 region:rollup2
CURRENT AND I KNOW ONE OF THE

02:04:14.681 --> 02:04:17.016 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE REPORT

02:04:16.316 --> 02:04:19.018 region:rollup2
HAS TO DO WITH INFORMATION

02:04:17.016 --> 02:04:21.020 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT I THINK THAT'S VERY

02:04:19.018 --> 02:04:22.288 region:rollup2
KEY AS WE MOVE ALONG. THIS IS

02:04:21.020 --> 02:04:25.325 region:rollup2
THE TYPE OF INFORMATION THAT

02:04:22.288 --> 02:04:26.993 region:rollup2
CANNOT GET LOST IT MUST BE

02:04:25.325 --> 02:04:28.728 region:rollup2
PULLED FORWARD.

02:04:26.993 --> 02:04:30.229 region:rollup2
EACH TIME WE DO INSPECTIONS EACH

02:04:28.728 --> 02:04:31.597 region:rollup2
TIME WE'RE DOING SOME REPAIRS IT

02:04:30.229 --> 02:04:33.499 region:rollup2
HAS TO BE LOOKED AT AGAIN I

02:04:31.597 --> 02:04:36.135 region:rollup2
THINK THAT'S A CHANGE.

02:04:33.499 --> 02:04:38.338 region:rollup2
ON THAT WE WILL INSTITUTE MOVING

02:04:36.135 --> 02:04:40.773 region:rollup2
AHEAD THAT IS DIFFERENT.

02:04:38.338 --> 02:04:41.774 region:rollup2
AND I BELIEVE ADDRESSES.

02:04:40.773 --> 02:04:43.409 region:rollup2
COUPLE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS IN

02:04:41.774 --> 02:04:44.377 region:rollup2
THE REPORT.

02:04:43.409 --> 02:04:45.878 region:rollup2
OKAY BUT DO YOU BELIEVE THE YOU

02:04:44.377 --> 02:04:47.113 region:rollup2
HAVE A SUFFICIENTLY STRONG DAM

02:04:45.878 --> 02:04:48.981 region:rollup2
SAFETY CULTURE.

02:04:47.113 --> 02:04:50.316 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW.

02:04:48.981 --> 02:04:52.685 region:rollup2
AND DOES IT ADEQUATELY

02:04:50.316 --> 02:04:54.187 region:rollup2
PRIORITIZE DAM SAFETY RELATIVE

02:04:52.685 --> 02:04:55.321 region:rollup2
TO THE NON SAFETY GOALS OF

02:04:54.187 --> 02:04:57.490 region:rollup2
DELIVERING WATER GENERATING

02:04:55.321 --> 02:04:59.659 region:rollup2
POWER CONTROLLING COSTS.

02:04:57.490 --> 02:05:02.628 region:rollup2
I BELIEVE THAT WE DO PRIORITIZE

02:04:59.659 --> 02:05:06.099 region:rollup2
DIEM SAFETY IS THE GROUP BIG

02:05:02.628 --> 02:05:07.600 region:rollup2
ENOUGH NO WE HAVE. A CORE GROUP.

02:05:06.099 --> 02:05:09.669 region:rollup2
AND WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE

02:05:07.600 --> 02:05:11.170 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE. THE ADMINISTRATION

02:05:09.669 --> 02:05:13.506 region:rollup2
THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO

02:05:11.170 --> 02:05:15.141 region:rollup2
BOLSTER THAT GROUP SO THAT WE

02:05:13.506 --> 02:05:16.876 region:rollup2
CAN.

02:05:15.141 --> 02:05:20.513 region:rollup2
AS WE MOVE FORWARD HAVE THE

02:05:16.876 --> 02:05:22.415 region:rollup2
EXPERTISE HAVE THE RESOURCES TO

02:05:20.513 --> 02:05:25.485 region:rollup2
DO THIS DEEPER DIVE IN TERMS OF

02:05:22.415 --> 02:05:26.619 region:rollup2
DAM SAFETY AND INSPECTIONS AND.

02:05:25.485 --> 02:05:27.687 region:rollup2
CHANGES TO THE INDUSTRY

02:05:26.619 --> 02:05:28.254 region:rollup2
STANDARDS THAT WE ANTICIPATE

02:05:27.687 --> 02:05:30.456 region:rollup2
WILL HAPPEN.

02:05:28.254 --> 02:05:32.091 region:rollup2
SO.

02:05:30.456 --> 02:05:34.227 region:rollup2
RIGHT OPINION IS IT IS A

02:05:32.091 --> 02:05:35.862 region:rollup2
PRIORITY FOR THE DEPARTMENT WILL

02:05:34.227 --> 02:05:37.463 region:rollup2
IT DOES IT.

02:05:35.862 --> 02:05:39.932 region:rollup2
WARRANT SOME ENHANCEMENTS

02:05:37.463 --> 02:05:41.901 region:rollup2
ABSOLUTELY.

02:05:39.932 --> 02:05:43.269 region:rollup2
LET ME JUST GIVE HER A QUICK

02:05:41.901 --> 02:05:43.903 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE THAT WAS IDENTIFIED

02:05:43.269 --> 02:05:45.371 region:rollup2
REPORT MISTER FRIENDS MAYBE YOU

02:05:43.903 --> 02:05:46.639 region:rollup2
CAN.

02:05:45.371 --> 02:05:48.808 region:rollup2
HELP ELABORATE ON THIS DURING

02:05:46.639 --> 02:05:50.476 region:rollup2
THE EMERGENCY INCIDENT.

02:05:48.808 --> 02:05:53.012 region:rollup2
YOU IDENTIFY THAT THERE WAS TWO

02:05:50.476 --> 02:05:55.948 region:rollup2
VERY CRITICAL DECISIONS MADE.

02:05:53.012 --> 02:05:58.017 region:rollup2
REGARDING SENDING FLOWS DOWN

02:05:55.948 --> 02:06:00.686 region:rollup2
THE REGULAR SPILLWAY THAT WAS

02:05:58.017 --> 02:06:02.388 region:rollup2
BROKEN AT THE TIME.

02:06:00.686 --> 02:06:04.157 region:rollup2
TWO KEY POINTS WHERE BASICALLY

02:06:02.388 --> 02:06:06.426 region:rollup2
FLOWS WERE REDUCED.

02:06:04.157 --> 02:06:09.862 region:rollup2
OR THEY WERE DELAYED.

02:06:06.426 --> 02:06:12.098 region:rollup2
A BECAUSE THERE WAS TWO GROUPS.

02:06:09.862 --> 02:06:13.800 region:rollup2
WITHIN THE W. ARE AT THE TIME.

02:06:12.098 --> 02:06:15.268 region:rollup2
ONE THAT WAS SAYING. NON THAT

02:06:13.800 --> 02:06:17.603 region:rollup2
THE GREATER RISK WAS LOSING THE

02:06:15.268 --> 02:06:19.739 region:rollup2
POWER HOUSE.

02:06:17.603 --> 02:06:20.706 region:rollup2
AND ANOTHER THAT WAS MUCHMORE

02:06:19.739 --> 02:06:22.809 region:rollup2
CONCERNED ABOUT THE EMERGENCY

02:06:20.706 --> 02:06:25.645 region:rollup2
SPILLWAY.

02:06:22.809 --> 02:06:26.679 region:rollup2
BECAUSE. AT THIS POINT THEY HAD

02:06:25.645 --> 02:06:28.514 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY PULLED THAT YELLED YOU

02:06:26.679 --> 02:06:29.782 region:rollup2
POURED OUT THE SHELF.

02:06:28.514 --> 02:06:31.017 region:rollup2
AND PEOPLE WOULD SAID YOU KNOW

02:06:29.782 --> 02:06:32.351 region:rollup2
WE GOT SOME REAL PROBLEMS WITH

02:06:31.017 --> 02:06:32.952 region:rollup2
THE EMERGENCY SPILLWAY TWO

02:06:32.351 --> 02:06:35.588 region:rollup2
GROUPS.

02:06:32.952 --> 02:06:37.056 region:rollup2
WHO?

02:06:35.588 --> 02:06:38.758 region:rollup2
WORSE YOU KNOW AND ULTIMATELY

02:06:37.056 --> 02:06:39.759 region:rollup2
THE GROUP THAT WANTED TO SAVE

02:06:38.758 --> 02:06:41.260 region:rollup2
THE POWERHOUSE THAT THOUGHT THAT

02:06:39.759 --> 02:06:43.296 region:rollup2
THAT WAS THE GREATER RISK ONE

02:06:41.260 --> 02:06:46.232 region:rollup2
OUT. YOU DESCRIBE THAT IN THE.

02:06:43.296 --> 02:06:47.800 region:rollup2
AT LEAST ONE OF THE REASONS.

02:06:46.232 --> 02:06:49.068 region:rollup2
BEHIND THE DECISION TO SAY THE

02:06:47.800 --> 02:06:51.337 region:rollup2
POWER HOUSE WAS THE CONCERN OVER

02:06:49.068 --> 02:06:53.139 region:rollup2
WATER DELIVERIES.

02:06:51.337 --> 02:06:55.875 region:rollup2
FOR LATER IN THE SUMMER OF THAT

02:06:53.139 --> 02:06:57.043 region:rollup2
YEAR. IS IS THAT A CORRECT

02:06:55.875 --> 02:06:58.578 region:rollup2
DEPICTION OF YOUR FINER THAN ME

02:06:57.043 --> 02:06:59.979 region:rollup2
ELABORATE IS.

02:06:58.578 --> 02:07:01.848 region:rollup2
HOWEVER YOU LIKE MR FRETS BUT IS

02:06:59.979 --> 02:07:03.516 region:rollup2
THAT ONE OF THE.

02:07:01.848 --> 02:07:05.418 region:rollup2
IS THAT AN EXAMPLE OF ONE OF THE

02:07:03.516 --> 02:07:07.487 region:rollup2
ISSUES HERE WE SAY THE.

02:07:05.418 --> 02:07:08.921 region:rollup2
THE DAM SAFETY COMPONENT IS OUT

02:07:07.487 --> 02:07:13.092 region:rollup2
OF BALANCE WITH OTHER NON SAFETY

02:07:08.921 --> 02:07:15.061 region:rollup2
CONCERNS.

02:07:13.092 --> 02:07:15.394 region:rollup2
BUT AGAIN AS I MENTIONED EARLIER

02:07:15.061 --> 02:07:18.030 region:rollup2
IT'S.

02:07:15.394 --> 02:07:19.365 region:rollup2
IT IS DIFFICULT PUT YOURSELF IN

02:07:18.030 --> 02:07:20.733 region:rollup2
THE PLACE IN THE THE PLACE TO

02:07:19.365 --> 02:07:22.268 region:rollup2
THE PEOPLE WHO WERE IN THE ROOM

02:07:20.733 --> 02:07:23.469 region:rollup2
THAT THE DEPICTION OF THE THE

02:07:22.268 --> 02:07:25.104 region:rollup2
INFORMATION COMING FROM THE TWO

02:07:23.469 --> 02:07:26.205 region:rollup2
SIDES IS CORRECT THAT'S WHAT WE

02:07:25.104 --> 02:07:27.540 region:rollup2
HEARD IS THAT.

02:07:26.205 --> 02:07:29.809 region:rollup2
THE DECISION MAKERS WERE BEING

02:07:27.540 --> 02:07:31.544 region:rollup2
ADVISED.

02:07:29.809 --> 02:07:32.945 region:rollup2
BY ONE GROUP THAT THE THE

02:07:31.544 --> 02:07:35.148 region:rollup2
PARAMOUNT CONCERN WAS THE

02:07:32.945 --> 02:07:36.616 region:rollup2
POWERHOUSE ANOTHER GROUP WAS

02:07:35.148 --> 02:07:37.683 region:rollup2
VERY CONCERNED AND AND THOUGHT

02:07:36.616 --> 02:07:39.085 region:rollup2
IT WAS A MORE IMPORTANT

02:07:37.683 --> 02:07:40.887 region:rollup2
CONCERNED THAT WE NOT OPERATE

02:07:39.085 --> 02:07:41.487 region:rollup2
THAT EMERGENCY SPILLWAY KNOWING

02:07:40.887 --> 02:07:42.688 region:rollup2
WHAT THE NEW AT THAT POINT IN

02:07:41.487 --> 02:07:44.824 region:rollup2
TIME.

02:07:42.688 --> 02:07:46.692 region:rollup2
OF WHAT WENT INTO THAT DECISION

02:07:44.824 --> 02:07:47.760 region:rollup2
AND THE CONFIDENCE IN THE MODELS

02:07:46.692 --> 02:07:50.096 region:rollup2
THAT GOOD MERCY SO IT WOULDN'T

02:07:47.760 --> 02:07:51.063 region:rollup2
BE USED. THAT'S WHERE I WASN'T

02:07:50.096 --> 02:07:52.465 region:rollup2
IN THE ROOM WHEN I DIE I DON'T

02:07:51.063 --> 02:07:53.399 region:rollup2
KNOW SO I CAN ABSOLUTELY FALL

02:07:52.465 --> 02:07:56.235 region:rollup2
THAT DECISION I MIGHT HAVE MADE

02:07:53.399 --> 02:07:58.104 region:rollup2
THE SAME THING SAME DECISION AND

02:07:56.235 --> 02:08:01.807 region:rollup2
AND IF I WERE IN THE SAME PLACE.

02:07:58.104 --> 02:08:03.709 region:rollup2
IT IT IS A.

02:08:01.807 --> 02:08:05.411 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT WILL WE DON'T KNOW.

02:08:03.709 --> 02:08:06.946 region:rollup2
IS EXACTLY.

02:08:05.411 --> 02:08:08.848 region:rollup2
WITH THE STRUCTURE OF THE DAM

02:08:06.946 --> 02:08:11.217 region:rollup2
SAFETY PROGRAM BEING WHAT IT WAS

02:08:08.848 --> 02:08:12.818 region:rollup2
WITHIN DWL R.. HAD IT HAD A

02:08:11.217 --> 02:08:14.687 region:rollup2
HIGHER PROFILE WOULD ITS VOICE

02:08:12.818 --> 02:08:15.488 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN HEARD MORE LOUDLY AT

02:08:14.687 --> 02:08:17.723 region:rollup2
THAT PARTICULAR POINT TIME

02:08:15.488 --> 02:08:18.724 region:rollup2
PERHAPS YES.

02:08:17.723 --> 02:08:21.494 region:rollup2
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S AN

02:08:18.724 --> 02:08:23.195 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE PERHAPS AN EXAMPLE OF OF

02:08:21.494 --> 02:08:25.565 region:rollup2
OF THE CULTURE.

02:08:23.195 --> 02:08:27.466 region:rollup2
COULD SIDE OF SIDE OF THINGS.

02:08:25.565 --> 02:08:28.868 region:rollup2
SO.

02:08:27.466 --> 02:08:30.803 region:rollup2
IT'S I DON'T WANNA FAULT THAT

02:08:28.868 --> 02:08:31.938 region:rollup2
THE CIVIC HAD WE'VE.

02:08:30.803 --> 02:08:33.272 region:rollup2
WE TRIED TO WRITE THE REPORT AS

02:08:31.938 --> 02:08:34.941 region:rollup2
CAREFUL AS WE COULD BUT

02:08:33.272 --> 02:08:36.342 region:rollup2
SOMETHING SOMETIMES THING SCREAM

02:08:34.941 --> 02:08:37.843 region:rollup2
OUT MORE LOUDLY THAT WE WANTED

02:08:36.342 --> 02:08:39.178 region:rollup2
TO SCREAM OUT I THINK THIS MAY

02:08:37.843 --> 02:08:40.646 region:rollup2
BE A BIT ONE WE REALLY DON'T

02:08:39.178 --> 02:08:41.614 region:rollup2
WANT TO SAY WE WE'RE NOT SAYING

02:08:40.646 --> 02:08:42.582 region:rollup2
THAT WAS A WRONG DECISION.

02:08:41.614 --> 02:08:44.483 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WHEN YOU'RE IN

02:08:42.582 --> 02:08:45.217 region:rollup2
EMERGENCIES LIKE THAT THERE

02:08:44.483 --> 02:08:46.586 region:rollup2
AREN'T WRONG DECISIONS YOU'RE

02:08:45.217 --> 02:08:47.920 region:rollup2
MAKING THE BEST DECISION YOU CAN

02:08:46.586 --> 02:08:50.323 region:rollup2
WITH WHAT YOU KNOW.

02:08:47.920 --> 02:08:51.991 region:rollup2
THEY THE CULTURE IDEA IS THAT

02:08:50.323 --> 02:08:53.993 region:rollup2
HE GOES BACK TO THE CULTURE IN

02:08:51.991 --> 02:08:56.562 region:rollup2
THE BALANCE.

02:08:53.993 --> 02:08:59.632 region:rollup2
GOES BACK TO THIS QUESTION OF

02:08:56.562 --> 02:09:00.700 region:rollup2
WHEN ANY ORGANIZATION HAS ITS

02:08:59.632 --> 02:09:02.535 region:rollup2
LIMITS ON AN AMOUNT OF MONEY IT

02:09:00.700 --> 02:09:04.136 region:rollup2
HAS IT HAS IT HAS AVAILABLE AND

02:09:02.535 --> 02:09:05.871 region:rollup2
IT HAS DIFFERENT OBJECTIVES.

02:09:04.136 --> 02:09:07.106 region:rollup2
AND WHILE WE'RE ALL WE'RE TRYING

02:09:05.871 --> 02:09:09.642 region:rollup2
TO SAY THIS REPORTS WE THINK

02:09:07.106 --> 02:09:11.043 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW WITH WHERE THE DAM

02:09:09.642 --> 02:09:13.346 region:rollup2
SAFETY PROGRAM IS WITHIN THE O.

02:09:11.043 --> 02:09:14.747 region:rollup2
M. ORGANIZATION. AND THEY'RE

02:09:13.346 --> 02:09:16.549 region:rollup2
THEY'RE NOT BEING AS FAR AS WE

02:09:14.747 --> 02:09:19.151 region:rollup2
COULD UNDERSTAND REGULAR

02:09:16.549 --> 02:09:20.586 region:rollup2
BRIEFINGS TO JOE OR ANOTHER

02:09:19.151 --> 02:09:22.455 region:rollup2
EXECUTIVE.

02:09:20.586 --> 02:09:23.856 region:rollup2
ON THE DAM SAFETY PROGRAM THAT

02:09:22.455 --> 02:09:25.257 region:rollup2
IT PERHAPS IS IN GETTING ITS

02:09:23.856 --> 02:09:26.892 region:rollup2
VOICE IN BALANCE WITH SOME OF

02:09:25.257 --> 02:09:28.494 region:rollup2
THOSE OTHER OBJECTIVES AND WOULD

02:09:26.892 --> 02:09:30.363 region:rollup2
LIKE TO SEE IT HAVE A. BIT OF A

02:09:28.494 --> 02:09:31.530 region:rollup2
LOUDER AND MORE PROMINENT VOICE

02:09:30.363 --> 02:09:32.798 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE SUGGESTING

02:09:31.530 --> 02:09:34.300 region:rollup2
NEEDS TO HAPPEN IN THEIR

02:09:32.798 --> 02:09:35.635 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT WAYS TO DO THAT.

02:09:34.300 --> 02:09:37.169 region:rollup2
A DIFFERENT WAYS FOR THAT TO

02:09:35.635 --> 02:09:38.704 region:rollup2
HAPPEN AND THAT'S FOR THAT'S THE

02:09:37.169 --> 02:09:40.806 region:rollup2
PUZZLE FOR DWI TO FIGURE OUT IS

02:09:38.704 --> 02:09:41.841 region:rollup2
HOW BILL IT.

02:09:40.806 --> 02:09:43.442 region:rollup2
AND THEN AND THEN PEOPLE WERE

02:09:41.841 --> 02:09:44.844 region:rollup2
INVOLVED IN DAM SAFETY TO REALLY

02:09:43.442 --> 02:09:45.878 region:rollup2
FEEL FREE THAT THEY CAN RAISE

02:09:44.844 --> 02:09:47.780 region:rollup2
ISSUES.

02:09:45.878 --> 02:09:51.284 region:rollup2
AND AND AND DAM SAFETY GETS ITS

02:09:47.780 --> 02:09:52.284 region:rollup2
VOICE.

02:09:51.284 --> 02:09:53.719 region:rollup2
SIMILAR IN GALLAGHER.

02:09:52.284 --> 02:09:54.687 region:rollup2
AND CHAIRMAN IF YOU WOULD MIND

02:09:53.719 --> 02:09:56.789 region:rollup2
I MEAN IF I COULD ADD A LITTLE

02:09:54.687 --> 02:09:58.791 region:rollup2
BIT TO THAT I WAS IN THE ROOM

02:09:56.789 --> 02:10:00.626 region:rollup2
NOT FOR EVERY MEETING WHILE THAT

02:09:58.791 --> 02:10:02.395 region:rollup2
WAS GOING ON AND CHAO'S ACTUALLY

02:10:00.626 --> 02:10:03.029 region:rollup2
GONNA GET TO THAT CERTAINLY

02:10:02.395 --> 02:10:04.130 region:rollup2
COULD YOU KNOW BECAUSE I KNOW

02:10:03.029 --> 02:10:05.598 region:rollup2
JOE YOU WERE PART OF THE.

02:10:04.130 --> 02:10:06.499 region:rollup2
INCIDENT COMMAND YOU KNOW I MEAN

02:10:05.598 --> 02:10:07.500 region:rollup2
I'M JUST.

02:10:06.499 --> 02:10:08.100 region:rollup2
FOR APPENDIX CELL I THINK

02:10:07.500 --> 02:10:08.734 region:rollup2
EVERYBODY ON THIS COMMITTEE

02:10:08.100 --> 02:10:09.969 region:rollup2
SHOULD LOOK AT IT BECAUSE IT

02:10:08.734 --> 02:10:11.537 region:rollup2
REALLY SHOWS WHAT HAPPENED ON

02:10:09.969 --> 02:10:12.672 region:rollup2
THE TIMELINE.

02:10:11.537 --> 02:10:14.974 region:rollup2
AND THE DISCUSSIONS THAT WERE

02:10:12.672 --> 02:10:16.776 region:rollup2
GOING ON BUT I JUST READ FROM A

02:10:14.974 --> 02:10:17.977 region:rollup2
COUPLE BUT CAN ARTS AND THERE IS

02:10:16.776 --> 02:10:18.511 region:rollup2
AND I'LL ASK YOU KNOW ASK YOU TO

02:10:17.977 --> 02:10:20.246 region:rollup2
RESPOND JEWELERS.

02:10:18.511 --> 02:10:21.981 region:rollup2
.

02:10:20.246 --> 02:10:23.482 region:rollup2
AT ONE POINT EXECUTIVE SAYS THE

02:10:21.981 --> 02:10:25.518 region:rollup2
PLANT IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE

02:10:23.482 --> 02:10:26.652 region:rollup2
EMERGENCY SPILLWAY. IN TERMS OF

02:10:25.518 --> 02:10:28.954 region:rollup2
PRIORITY

02:10:26.652 --> 02:10:30.056 region:rollup2
.

02:10:28.954 --> 02:10:31.190 region:rollup2
ONE FEBRUARY TENTH THERE WAS A

02:10:30.056 --> 02:10:33.426 region:rollup2
DECISION MADE.

02:10:31.190 --> 02:10:35.961 region:rollup2
.

02:10:33.426 --> 02:10:36.629 region:rollup2
TO TAKE THE FLOWS THERE OF SPILL

02:10:35.961 --> 02:10:37.997 region:rollup2
IS RUNNING AT SIXTY FIVE

02:10:36.629 --> 02:10:40.032 region:rollup2
THOUSAND CFS.

02:10:37.997 --> 02:10:41.600 region:rollup2
AT THAT TIME.

02:10:40.032 --> 02:10:42.902 region:rollup2
AND THE EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT

02:10:41.600 --> 02:10:44.603 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY TALE REYES WAS GOING

02:10:42.902 --> 02:10:46.305 region:rollup2
DOWN SO THE THREAT OF FLOODING

02:10:44.603 --> 02:10:48.074 region:rollup2
TO THE POWER HOUSE.

02:10:46.305 --> 02:10:49.475 region:rollup2
NOW WAS NOT A MINUTE AT THAT

02:10:48.074 --> 02:10:51.944 region:rollup2
TIME IT WAS DECREASING.

02:10:49.475 --> 02:10:53.179 region:rollup2
AT THAT TIME. AND THERE WAS A

02:10:51.944 --> 02:10:55.247 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT DECISION MADE.

02:10:53.179 --> 02:10:57.283 region:rollup2
.

02:10:55.247 --> 02:10:58.851 region:rollup2
TO LOWER THE LEVELS FROM SIXTY

02:10:57.283 --> 02:11:01.020 region:rollup2
FIVE THOUSAND A FIFTY FIVE

02:10:58.851 --> 02:11:02.555 region:rollup2
THOUSAND IS DETAILED THAT. HAD

02:11:01.020 --> 02:11:03.189 region:rollup2
THE KEPT RUNNING AT SIXTY FIVE

02:11:02.555 --> 02:11:03.456 region:rollup2
THOUSAND WE WOULD HAVE GOTTEN TO

02:11:03.189 --> 02:11:04.156 region:rollup2
EMERGENCY

02:11:03.456 --> 02:11:06.192 region:rollup2
SPILLWAY.

02:11:04.156 --> 02:11:07.593 region:rollup2
.

02:11:06.192 --> 02:11:09.261 region:rollup2
BUT THERE WAS A DECISION MADE TO

02:11:07.593 --> 02:11:11.297 region:rollup2
LOWER BACK DOWN TO FIFTY FIVE

02:11:09.261 --> 02:11:13.666 region:rollup2
THOUSAND THAT DECISION WAS MADE.

02:11:11.297 --> 02:11:14.934 region:rollup2
QUOTE HERE AND ON PAGE EL TEN

02:11:13.666 --> 02:11:16.602 region:rollup2
THERE WAS SILENCE RATHER THAN

02:11:14.934 --> 02:11:18.604 region:rollup2
EXPLICIT AGREEMENT.

02:11:16.602 --> 02:11:20.005 region:rollup2
FROM MOST AND THOSE MOST

02:11:18.604 --> 02:11:21.841 region:rollup2
PREVIOUSLY VOCAL IN THEIR

02:11:20.005 --> 02:11:23.576 region:rollup2
OPPOSITION WERE NOT PART OF THE

02:11:21.841 --> 02:11:24.877 region:rollup2
DECISION INCLUDING THE CHIEF DAM

02:11:23.576 --> 02:11:27.079 region:rollup2
SAFETY OFFICER.

.

02:11:27.079 --> 02:11:30.182 region:rollup2
THAT I WOULD ALSO POINT OUT.

02:11:29.615 --> 02:11:31.884 region:rollup2
THERE WHEN THAT DECISION WAS

02:11:30.182 --> 02:11:33.819 region:rollup2
MADE.

02:11:31.884 --> 02:11:35.821 region:rollup2
IT ALSO STATES THE INCIDENT

02:11:33.819 --> 02:11:38.457 region:rollup2
COMMAND DISAGREED WITH THAT.

02:11:35.821 --> 02:11:40.226 region:rollup2
DECISION.

02:11:38.457 --> 02:11:41.527 region:rollup2
AND ALL.

02:11:40.226 --> 02:11:51.337 region:rollup2

RIGHT NOW THAT. LEAH THE

02:11:53.639 --> 02:11:57.443 region:rollup2
INCIDENT COMMAND THAT DISAGREE

02:11:55.574 --> 02:11:59.478 region:rollup2
WITH THAT AND TRY TO OVERTURN

02:11:57.443 --> 02:12:00.980 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT MANAGEMENT SAID THE

02:11:59.478 --> 02:12:02.348 region:rollup2
DECISIONS ALREADY BEEN MADE.

02:12:00.980 --> 02:12:04.917 region:rollup2
WE'RE KEEPING IT FIFTY FIVE

NOT THE INCIDENT COMMANDER BUT I

02:12:14.693 --> 02:12:18.230 region:rollup2

02:13:17.590 --> 02:13:21.360 region:rollup2
AND. THERE'S BAD ROCK BAD ROCK

02:13:19.458 --> 02:13:23.562 region:rollup2
UNDER THE SPILLWAY AND WE CANNOT

02:13:21.360 --> 02:13:25.664 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO ERODE IT. SO THERE

02:13:23.562 --> 02:13:27.166 region:rollup2
WAS RISKS IN ALL THOSE AREAS

02:13:25.664 --> 02:13:29.368 region:rollup2
THAT WE WERE TRYING TO MANAGE IT

02:13:27.166 --> 02:13:32.438 region:rollup2
WASN'T A SINGLE ONE THAT WAS

02:13:29.368 --> 02:13:34.440 region:rollup2
BEING FOCUSED IS CAN WE FIND.

02:13:32.438 --> 02:13:36.242 region:rollup2
FLOWS

02:13:34.440 --> 02:13:37.610 region:rollup2
THAT MAKE THE WHOLE SITUATION

02:13:36.242 --> 02:13:38.944 region:rollup2
AND COME OUT WITH THE BEST

02:13:37.610 --> 02:13:40.179 region:rollup2
OUTCOME AND SO THAT'S WHAT WE

02:13:38.944 --> 02:13:42.114 region:rollup2
WERE MANAGING THROUGH AND

02:13:40.179 --> 02:13:43.649 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY IN A CRISIS. THERE'S

02:13:42.114 --> 02:13:44.884 region:rollup2
INFORMATION FROM A LOT EXPERTS

02:13:43.649 --> 02:13:47.219 region:rollup2
COMING IN FROM A LOT OF

02:13:44.884 --> 02:13:49.188 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT AREAS IN THE HARD PART

02:13:47.219 --> 02:13:51.156 region:rollup2
AT THAT MOMENT A TIME IS AT RISK

02:13:49.188 --> 02:13:52.925 region:rollup2
IS HARD TO CALCULATE. AT EVERY

02:13:51.156 --> 02:13:54.560 region:rollup2
MOMENT A TIME AND YOURS YOU'RE

02:13:52.925 --> 02:13:55.794 region:rollup2
TAKING IN THAT INFILL MAKING

02:13:54.560 --> 02:13:58.397 region:rollup2
DECISIONS SO THEY.

02:13:55.794 --> 02:14:00.799 region:rollup2
WHEN WE DECIDED TO MOVE TO FLOWS

02:13:58.397 --> 02:14:02.568 region:rollup2
FROM SIXTY FIVE TO FIFTY FIVE IT

02:14:00.799 --> 02:14:04.737 region:rollup2
WAS BECAUSE THE MODELING WAS

02:14:02.568 --> 02:14:06.672 region:rollup2
SHOWING THAT THAT. WAS ENOUGH TO

02:14:04.737 --> 02:14:09.041 region:rollup2
KEEP THE WATER AWAY FROM FLOWING

02:14:06.672 --> 02:14:11.210 region:rollup2
OVER THE EMERGENCY SPILLWAY.

02:14:09.041 --> 02:14:13.712 region:rollup2
THAT WAS PUTTING THE IN THE.

02:14:11.210 --> 02:14:17.283 region:rollup2
FLOOD CONTROL OUTLET SPILLWAY

02:14:13.712 --> 02:14:19.084 region:rollup2
IN LESS RISK OF CONTAINING DO

02:14:17.283 --> 02:14:21.053 region:rollup2
ROAD WHICH WE WERE SAYING SO WE

02:14:19.084 --> 02:14:22.855 region:rollup2
WERE SEEN THAT HAPPENED IT

02:14:21.053 --> 02:14:24.290 region:rollup2
WASN'T LIKE A RISK THAT COULD

02:14:22.855 --> 02:14:27.159 region:rollup2
HAPPEN WE WERE SEEN CHUNKS OF A

02:14:24.290 --> 02:14:28.327 region:rollup2
HUNDRED FEET. OF SPILLWAY.

02:14:27.159 --> 02:14:29.628 region:rollup2
ALMOST ON A DAILY BASIS IS BEING

02:14:28.327 --> 02:14:32.097 region:rollup2
LOST

02:14:29.628 --> 02:14:34.767 region:rollup2
AND WE HAD THOSE TRIGGERS OF.

02:14:32.097 --> 02:14:36.468 region:rollup2
WE CANNOT LET IT GET TO A POINT.

02:14:34.767 --> 02:14:38.771 region:rollup2
WHERE IT MAKES THAT SPILLWAYS

02:14:36.468 --> 02:14:41.106 region:rollup2
UNSERVICEABLE AND NOW YOU HAVE A

02:14:38.771 --> 02:14:42.541 region:rollup2
SITUATION WHERE? IT'S BASICALLY

02:14:41.106 --> 02:14:44.376 region:rollup2
A RUN OF THE RIVER DAM WHERE

02:14:42.541 --> 02:14:46.445 region:rollup2
WHATEVER'S COMING AND IS COMING

02:14:44.376 --> 02:14:47.446 region:rollup2
OUT WE CANNOT AND THAT THERE SO.

02:14:46.445 --> 02:14:49.315 region:rollup2
IT WAS TRYING TO MANAGE ALL

02:14:47.446 --> 02:14:51.216 region:rollup2
RISKS.

02:14:49.315 --> 02:14:53.385 region:rollup2
AND TAKE PUBLIC SAFETY AS THE

02:14:51.216 --> 02:14:54.954 region:rollup2
HIGHEST PRIORITY. AND FIND THAT

02:14:53.385 --> 02:14:56.255 region:rollup2
SWEET SPOT WHERE IS EVERY

02:14:54.954 --> 02:14:58.190 region:rollup2
DECISION PERFECT.

02:14:56.255 --> 02:14:59.959 region:rollup2
I DON'T KNOW.

02:14:58.190 --> 02:15:01.293 region:rollup2
BUT THEY WERE DECISIONS THAT

02:14:59.959 --> 02:15:03.262 region:rollup2
WERE BEST A SITUATION THAT WE

02:15:01.293 --> 02:15:04.396 region:rollup2
HAD AND I THINK THAT'S.

02:15:03.262 --> 02:15:06.432 region:rollup2
KIND OF WHAT I HEARD THE

02:15:04.396 --> 02:15:06.899 region:rollup2
FORENSICS TEAM SAY WHEN ASKED

02:15:06.432 --> 02:15:10.436 region:rollup2
WOULD THEY DO ANYTHING

02:15:06.899 --> 02:15:11.170 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT.

02:15:10.436 --> 02:15:12.605 region:rollup2
RIGHT AND AGAIN I THINK IT'S

02:15:11.170 --> 02:15:14.440 region:rollup2
BEEN SO WE'RE NOT TRYING TO YOU

02:15:12.605 --> 02:15:16.075 region:rollup2
KNOW SECOND GUESS EVERY DECISION

02:15:14.440 --> 02:15:17.743 region:rollup2
THAT WAS MADE IN THERE BUT THERE

02:15:16.075 --> 02:15:18.444 region:rollup2
WERE DECISIONS BEING MADE IN

02:15:17.743 --> 02:15:20.079 region:rollup2
THERE WAS A DECISION MADE

02:15:18.444 --> 02:15:22.448 region:rollup2
ULTIMATELY.

02:15:20.079 --> 02:15:24.683 region:rollup2
TO REDUCE THAT FLOW FROM SIXTY

02:15:22.448 --> 02:15:25.918 region:rollup2
FIVE THOUSAND CFS TO FIFTY FIVE

02:15:24.683 --> 02:15:27.753 region:rollup2
THOUSAND CFS NO ONE AGAIN AND

02:15:25.918 --> 02:15:29.088 region:rollup2
ALL THE DETAILS BUT. IT'S ALSO

02:15:27.753 --> 02:15:30.756 region:rollup2
VERY CLEARLY SPELLED OUT HERE

02:15:29.088 --> 02:15:32.358 region:rollup2
THAT THE EROSION AT THE SPILLWAY

02:15:30.756 --> 02:15:34.760 region:rollup2
AND ACTUALLY STABILIZED AT THAT

02:15:32.358 --> 02:15:36.729 region:rollup2
POINT. HAS HAD THE STABILIZATION

02:15:34.760 --> 02:15:37.262 region:rollup2
OF THE POWER OF THE POWER LINE

02:15:36.729 --> 02:15:38.030 region:rollup2
THAT PEOPLE WERE CONCERNED

02:15:37.262 --> 02:15:40.065 region:rollup2
ABOUT.

02:15:38.030 --> 02:15:42.234 region:rollup2
BUT.

02:15:40.065 --> 02:15:43.369 region:rollup2
DID THE VERY CLEAR FINDING HERE

02:15:42.234 --> 02:15:45.337 region:rollup2
IN NOT JUST RELATED TO THE

02:15:43.369 --> 02:15:47.740 region:rollup2
EMERGENCY INCIDENT.

02:15:45.337 --> 02:15:49.608 region:rollup2
BUT JUST ACROSS THE BOARD IS

02:15:47.740 --> 02:15:50.843 region:rollup2
THAT PUBLIC SAFETY PRIORITY IS

02:15:49.608 --> 02:15:52.978 region:rollup2
OUT OF BALANCE WITH OTHER NON

02:15:50.843 --> 02:15:54.880 region:rollup2
SAFETY PRIORITIES THAT IS THE

02:15:52.978 --> 02:15:55.981 region:rollup2
FINDING OF THIS REPORT.

02:15:54.880 --> 02:15:58.784 region:rollup2
THAT'S VERY CLEAR IS THAT RIGHT

02:15:55.981 --> 02:16:00.552 region:rollup2
MR FRANCE.

02:15:58.784 --> 02:16:02.021 region:rollup2
THAT'S PERHAPS STATED A LITTLE

02:16:00.552 --> 02:16:03.455 region:rollup2
MORE STRONGLY THAN I WOULD

02:16:02.021 --> 02:16:04.490 region:rollup2
STATED OR I THINK THE REPORT

02:16:03.455 --> 02:16:06.759 region:rollup2
STATES IT BUT.

02:16:04.490 --> 02:16:08.894 region:rollup2
IT DID.

02:16:06.759 --> 02:16:09.695 region:rollup2
THE DAM SAFETY WE THINK NEEDS A

02:16:08.894 --> 02:16:11.764 region:rollup2
LOUDER VOICE THAN IT HAS.

02:16:09.695 --> 02:16:13.666 region:rollup2
.

02:16:11.764 --> 02:16:15.300 region:rollup2
AND AND TO BE ISSUE TO BE MORE

02:16:13.666 --> 02:16:17.870 region:rollup2
CONFIDENT THAT ALL THOSE.

02:16:15.300 --> 02:16:19.872 region:rollup2
OBJECTIVES ARE IN BALANCE.

02:16:17.870 --> 02:16:20.873 region:rollup2
AND WHAT I WANT TO KNOW BECAUSE

02:16:19.872 --> 02:16:22.107 region:rollup2
I'VE HEARD FROM MISS YOU MR

02:16:20.873 --> 02:16:23.442 region:rollup2
PATTERSON ASKED YOU A QUESTION

02:16:22.107 --> 02:16:25.444 region:rollup2
YOU SAID WE DON'T QUITE AGREE

02:16:23.442 --> 02:16:26.011 region:rollup2
THAT WE'RE OVERCONFIDENT. WE

02:16:25.444 --> 02:16:27.079 region:rollup2
DON'T QUITE AGREE THAT WERE

02:16:26.011 --> 02:16:28.047 region:rollup2
COMPLACENT.

02:16:27.079 --> 02:16:29.281 region:rollup2
I'M HERE AND WE DON'T REALLY

02:16:28.047 --> 02:16:30.382 region:rollup2
QUITE AGREE THAT WERE OUT OF

02:16:29.281 --> 02:16:32.851 region:rollup2
BALANCE ON.

02:16:30.382 --> 02:16:34.219 region:rollup2
PUBLIC SAFETY OF THE FIRST PART

02:16:32.851 --> 02:16:35.320 region:rollup2
OF THIS WHOLE THING OF CHANGE

02:16:34.219 --> 02:16:35.821 region:rollup2
THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN IS

02:16:35.320 --> 02:16:37.923 region:rollup2
ADMITTING THAT THERE'S A

02:16:35.821 --> 02:16:39.458 region:rollup2
PROBLEM.

02:16:37.923 --> 02:16:41.827 region:rollup2
AND THERE'S A LOT TO DO IN THIS

02:16:39.458 --> 02:16:44.229 region:rollup2
AND I KNOW IT'S GONNA TAKE TIME.

02:16:41.827 --> 02:16:46.098 region:rollup2
BUT FIRST I WANT TO HEAR IDW R.

02:16:44.229 --> 02:16:48.267 region:rollup2
WE AGREE WITH THESE FINDINGS.

02:16:46.098 --> 02:16:50.402 region:rollup2
WE AGREE THERE'S A PROBLEM.

02:16:48.267 --> 02:16:51.336 region:rollup2
AND WERE GOING TO.

02:16:50.402 --> 02:16:51.970 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT THESE AND

02:16:51.336 --> 02:16:54.106 region:rollup2
OTHER SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS

02:16:51.970 --> 02:16:55.441 region:rollup2
IN HERE.

02:16:54.106 --> 02:16:56.775 region:rollup2
THAT ARE TWO D. W. ARE NOT TO

02:16:55.441 --> 02:16:58.410 region:rollup2
THE INDUSTRY AT LARGE BUT TO D.

02:16:56.775 --> 02:16:59.978 region:rollup2
W. ARE.

02:16:58.410 --> 02:17:02.681 region:rollup2
ARE THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS GOING

02:16:59.978 --> 02:17:03.982 region:rollup2
TO BE IMPLEMENTED BY YOU.

02:17:02.681 --> 02:17:05.651 region:rollup2
AND WOULD YOU AND AND I AS JUST

02:17:03.982 --> 02:17:07.186 region:rollup2
A QUICK FAULT THAT WOULD YOU BE

02:17:05.651 --> 02:17:09.288 region:rollup2
OPEN TO HAVING MR FRANCE MAYBE

02:17:07.186 --> 02:17:11.523 region:rollup2
THE FORENSIC TEAM OR AN OUTSIDE

02:17:09.288 --> 02:17:11.990 region:rollup2
BODY STAY ON. TO ENSURE THAT

02:17:11.523 --> 02:17:15.494 region:rollup2
THOSE ARE IMPLEMENTED

02:17:11.990 --> 02:17:18.764 region:rollup2
ADEQUATELY.

02:17:15.494 --> 02:17:20.466 region:rollup2
OKAY WELL I WILL START SO WHILE

02:17:18.764 --> 02:17:22.201 region:rollup2
I HAVE BEEN THE ONE WHO IS SAID

02:17:20.466 --> 02:17:23.435 region:rollup2
I DON'T QUITE AGREE. ON THOSE

02:17:22.201 --> 02:17:25.704 region:rollup2
VARIOUS FACETS.

02:17:23.435 --> 02:17:27.906 region:rollup2
THERE IS.

02:17:25.704 --> 02:17:29.775 region:rollup2
A PORTION IN ALL OF THOSE THAT I

02:17:27.906 --> 02:17:31.443 region:rollup2
DO AGREE WITH AN EVEN IF I DON'T

02:17:29.775 --> 02:17:33.645 region:rollup2
THIS IS.

02:17:31.443 --> 02:17:35.581 region:rollup2
THE FOR THE.

02:17:33.645 --> 02:17:38.550 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO TAKE A HALF STEP BACK

02:17:35.581 --> 02:17:40.486 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO APPROACH THIS.

02:17:38.550 --> 02:17:43.755 region:rollup2
FRESH EYES WITH EGO CHECKED AT

02:17:40.486 --> 02:17:45.557 region:rollup2
THE DOOR WITH HEY THIS IS ABOUT

02:17:43.755 --> 02:17:47.760 region:rollup2
MOVING FORWARD ABOUT MAKING

02:17:45.557 --> 02:17:49.595 region:rollup2
IMPROVEMENTS ENHANCEMENTS DOING

02:17:47.760 --> 02:17:50.929 region:rollup2
THINGS DIFFERENTLY WITHIN THE

02:17:49.595 --> 02:17:52.331 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT AND HOW THAT CAN

02:17:50.929 --> 02:17:55.367 region:rollup2
MODEL THE WAY.

02:17:52.331 --> 02:17:57.503 region:rollup2
FOR THE INDUSTRY ITSELF SO YES

02:17:55.367 --> 02:17:58.937 region:rollup2
WE ARE COMMITTED TO.

02:17:57.503 --> 02:18:01.106 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTING THE RECOMMENDATIONS

02:17:58.937 --> 02:18:02.875 region:rollup2
IN THIS REPORT DO WE HAVE ALL

02:18:01.106 --> 02:18:04.943 region:rollup2
THAT SORTED OUT NOT QUITE YET

02:18:02.875 --> 02:18:06.512 region:rollup2
WE'RE STILL GOING THROUGH THE

02:18:04.943 --> 02:18:07.913 region:rollup2
REPORT ITSELF AS MR FRANCE SAID

02:18:06.512 --> 02:18:09.948 region:rollup2
WE.

02:18:07.913 --> 02:18:12.684 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOT GIVING.

02:18:09.948 --> 02:18:13.685 region:rollup2
IN ADVANCE COPY THE DRAFT OR

02:18:12.684 --> 02:18:16.088 region:rollup2
ANYTHING LIKE THAT'S A WORSE

02:18:13.685 --> 02:18:16.688 region:rollup2
STILL GOING THROUGH IT AND.

02:18:16.088 --> 02:18:18.423 region:rollup2
FIGURE OUT WHAT OUR GAME PLAN

02:18:16.688 --> 02:18:20.425 region:rollup2
IS.

02:18:18.423 --> 02:18:21.960 region:rollup2
TWO MOVIES FOR AND THAT'S

02:18:20.425 --> 02:18:23.829 region:rollup2
SOMETHING WE COULD COME BACK.

02:18:21.960 --> 02:18:24.863 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY BUT IT WE HAVE A

02:18:23.829 --> 02:18:26.431 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT BETTER BAKED WE CAN

02:18:24.863 --> 02:18:28.133 region:rollup2
KIND OF LAY IT OUT FOR THE

02:18:26.431 --> 02:18:29.301 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE MEMBERS WE'D BE HAPPY

02:18:28.133 --> 02:18:31.436 region:rollup2
TO DO THAT.

02:18:29.301 --> 02:18:33.071 region:rollup2
SO THERE IS A COMMITMENT I WILL

02:18:31.436 --> 02:18:34.807 region:rollup2
SAY THAT YES TO IMPLEMENTING NOW

02:18:33.071 --> 02:18:35.808 region:rollup2
ABOUT TO HAVE AN OUTSIDE EXPERT

02:18:34.807 --> 02:18:36.675 region:rollup2
BODY.

02:18:35.808 --> 02:18:39.178 region:rollup2
HELPING WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION

02:18:36.675 --> 02:18:40.979 region:rollup2
OF THOSE.

02:18:39.178 --> 02:18:42.748 region:rollup2
SO IS PART OF THIS A

02:18:40.979 --> 02:18:45.217 region:rollup2
COMPREHENSIVE NEEDS ASSESSMENT.

02:18:42.748 --> 02:18:47.019 region:rollup2
WE ARE HIRING A.

02:18:45.217 --> 02:18:49.087 region:rollup2
FLORIDA CONSULTANTS PER SE AND

02:18:47.019 --> 02:18:50.556 region:rollup2
WILL AGAIN LIKE LIKE THE BORDER

02:18:49.087 --> 02:18:52.324 region:rollup2
CONSOLES IN THE FORENSICS TEAM

02:18:50.556 --> 02:18:54.193 region:rollup2
NOW WE'RE GONNA GO TO THIS DANCE

02:18:52.324 --> 02:18:55.994 region:rollup2
SAFETY ORGANIZATION.

02:18:54.193 --> 02:18:57.429 region:rollup2
HAVE THEM PICK YOU KNOW THE

02:18:55.994 --> 02:18:59.464 region:rollup2
EXPERTS IN THE WORLDAND HAVE

02:18:57.429 --> 02:19:01.400 region:rollup2
THEM BE ANOTHER CONSOLE ABOARD A

02:18:59.464 --> 02:19:02.701 region:rollup2
CONSULTANT'S BASICALLY TO REVIEW

02:19:01.400 --> 02:19:04.336 region:rollup2
OUR FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

02:19:02.701 --> 02:19:05.604 region:rollup2
YES.

02:19:04.336 --> 02:19:07.573 region:rollup2
PRIVATE I MEAN BECAUSE WE KNOW

02:19:05.604 --> 02:19:08.907 region:rollup2
MORE ABOUT THIS JEWEL THAT I

02:19:07.573 --> 02:19:09.708 region:rollup2

02:21:47.232 --> 02:21:50.635 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENTAL AGENCY.

02:21:49.267 --> 02:21:53.772 region:rollup2
GETS OSSIFIED BECOMES INSULAR

WHATEVER IT HAPPENS.

D. W. ARE IN THIS SPECIFIC CASE

02:21:55.707 --> 02:22:00.312 region:rollup2

DID POINT THAT OUT FOR DECADES.

02:22:00.312 --> 02:22:03.081 region:rollup2
LET ME ABOUT FIFTY YEARS.

02:22:02.447 --> 02:22:04.850 region:rollup2
CERTAIN THINGS ARE NOT ATTENDED

02:22:03.081 --> 02:22:07.486 region:rollup2
TO.

02:22:04.850 --> 02:22:08.053 region:rollup2
WHAT INSPECTIONS DID OCCUR?

02:22:07.486 --> 02:22:10.155 region:rollup2
SOME KIND OF THINGS DID NOT

02:22:08.053 --> 02:22:12.324 region:rollup2
HAPPEN.

02:22:10.155 --> 02:22:13.892 region:rollup2
ONE OF MY FIRST QUESTION IS DID

02:22:12.324 --> 02:22:14.693 region:rollup2
YOU DO ANY BORING. BUSH BORE

02:22:13.892 --> 02:22:15.293 region:rollup2

SEE WHAT'S GOING ON UNDERNEATH

02:22:15.293 --> 02:22:28.140 region:rollup2
SEVEN THE GALLAGHER DID SOME

02:22:26.204 --> 02:22:31.610 region:rollup2
RESEARCH AND JUST SUFFICE TO SAY

02:22:28.140 --> 02:22:34.312 region:rollup2
THERE WAS NOT MUCH BORING DOT.

02:22:31.610 --> 02:22:35.414 region:rollup2
MORE SURFACE INSPECTION.

02:22:34.312 --> 02:22:37.516 region:rollup2
AND THEN NOT ATTENDING TO THOSE

02:22:35.414 --> 02:22:39.684 region:rollup2
SIX.

02:22:37.516 --> 02:22:40.252 region:rollup2
THAT BEING THE CASE THEN.

02:22:39.684 --> 02:22:41.887 region:rollup2
WHAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT IS

02:22:40.252 --> 02:22:43.121 region:rollup2
WHAT?

02:22:41.887 --> 02:22:47.626 region:rollup2
KIND OF OVERSIGHT PROSPECTIVELY

02:22:43.121 --> 02:22:50.128 region:rollup2
CAN OCCUR.

02:22:47.626 --> 02:22:52.164 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATIONS TO. THAT DIFFERENT

02:22:50.128 --> 02:22:53.565 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONS ARE HIRING

CONSULTANTS THAT'S FINE.

02:22:53.565 --> 02:22:56.601 region:rollup2
BUT THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME OTHER

02:22:54.266 --> 02:22:58.336 region:rollup2
MORE STRUCTURAL CHANGES

02:22:56.601 --> 02:22:59.704 region:rollup2
NOW ONE OF THE DRASTIC ONES

02:22:58.336 --> 02:23:01.673 region:rollup2
WOULD BE TO TAKE THE DIVISION OF

02:22:59.704 --> 02:23:03.008 region:rollup2

AND.

02:23:11.416 --> 02:23:14.586 region:rollup2
THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME CHANGES.

02:23:13.552 --> 02:23:17.322 region:rollup2
AND ON THE TIMELINE.

02:23:14.586 --> 02:23:18.890 region:rollup2

02:24:50.916 --> 02:24:54.219 region:rollup2
MAYBE A HIGH LEVEL PLAN THAT WE

02:24:52.717 --> 02:24:55.787 region:rollup2
BE TURNING AND FOR BUT MAYBE A

02:24:54.219 --> 02:24:56.922 region:rollup2
MORE DETAILED PLAN THAT.

02:24:55.787 --> 02:24:58.156 region:rollup2
IF YOU GUYS AT QUESTIONS WE GET

02:24:56.922 --> 02:25:03.495 region:rollup2
ANSWERS SO WE DO INTEND TO DO

02:24:58.156 --> 02:25:05.263 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:25:03.495 --> 02:25:07.232 region:rollup2
THEN IT SPEECH GOTO AND AND I

02:25:05.263 --> 02:25:08.600 region:rollup2
WAS GONNA SAY THANK YOU TO ALL

02:25:07.232 --> 02:25:09.801 region:rollup2
THAT YES I THINK.

02:25:08.600 --> 02:25:11.803 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD BE AN INITIAL HIGH

02:25:09.801 --> 02:25:12.237 region:rollup2
LEVEL KIND OF SKETCHED OUT PLAN

02:25:11.803 --> 02:25:13.738 region:rollup2
BUT.

02:25:12.237 --> 02:25:14.573 region:rollup2
SORT OF EVEN BACK TO

02:25:13.738 --> 02:25:15.907 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLYMEMBER PATTERSON'S

02:25:14.573 --> 02:25:16.942 region:rollup2
QUESTION ABOUT WHAT KEEPS ME UP

02:25:15.907 --> 02:25:20.011 region:rollup2
AT NIGHT THE FOUR TO SIX MONTHS

02:25:16.942 --> 02:25:21.880 region:rollup2
IN MY. MIND IS A PLAN THAT IS

02:25:20.011 --> 02:25:24.049 region:rollup2
MORE DETAIL THAT REALLY FOR THE

02:25:21.880 --> 02:25:25.350 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT WE IDENTIFY CLEARLY

02:25:24.049 --> 02:25:26.851 region:rollup2
WHO'S DOING WHAT WHAT ARE THE

02:25:25.350 --> 02:25:28.520 region:rollup2
MECHANISMS TO IMPLEMENT TO

02:25:26.851 --> 02:25:30.488 region:rollup2
ACCOUNT FOR TO REPORT SO IT

02:25:28.520 --> 02:25:32.324 region:rollup2
WOULD BE A.

02:25:30.488 --> 02:25:33.892 region:rollup2
A. MORE ROBUST PLAN IF YOU WILL

02:25:32.324 --> 02:25:35.660 region:rollup2
DETAILED THAT REALLY SKETCHES

02:25:33.892 --> 02:25:37.362 region:rollup2
THINGS OUT FROM THE DEPARTMENT

02:25:35.660 --> 02:25:39.064 region:rollup2
AND ILLUSTRATES HOW WE'VE

02:25:37.362 --> 02:25:41.299 region:rollup2
CHANGES WE'VE MADE.

02:25:39.064 --> 02:25:43.001 region:rollup2
HOW WE MADE SHIFT

02:25:41.299 --> 02:25:45.737 region:rollup2
SOME? ACTIONS WITHIN THE

02:25:43.001 --> 02:25:46.938 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT TO PRIORITIZE WERE

02:25:45.737 --> 02:25:49.507 region:rollup2
MOVED RESOURCES TO THIS

02:25:46.938 --> 02:25:51.243 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR AREA SO I THINK IT'LL

02:25:49.507 --> 02:25:52.777 region:rollup2
COME INTO FACES IS PROBABLY THE

02:25:51.243 --> 02:25:55.146 region:rollup2
SHORT ANSWER TO LET ME DOWN

02:25:52.777 --> 02:25:55.747 region:rollup2
EMPHASIZE SOMETHING THAT THAT I

02:25:55.146 --> 02:25:58.750 region:rollup2
AM LOOKING FOR AN EXPECTED.AS

02:25:55.747 --> 02:26:02.053 region:rollup2
YOU PROCEED PROSPECTIVELY TO

02:25:58.750 --> 02:26:04.155 region:rollup2
ADDRESS THESE AREAS OF CHANGE.

02:26:02.053 --> 02:26:06.524 region:rollup2
THAT THEY BE DONE IN AN OPEN

02:26:04.155 --> 02:26:09.027 region:rollup2
PUBLIC PROCESS I ASKED THE

02:26:06.524 --> 02:26:10.829 region:rollup2
QUESTION IN A RECENT MEETING

02:26:09.027 --> 02:26:12.297 region:rollup2
WHERE THESE GOING TO BE IF MUCH.

02:26:10.829 --> 02:26:13.898 region:rollup2
EMBODIED AND REGULATIONS AND

02:26:12.297 --> 02:26:15.266 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVE THROUGH REGULATION AND

02:26:13.898 --> 02:26:17.369 region:rollup2
IT WAS KIND OF THERE WAS

02:26:15.266 --> 02:26:19.304 region:rollup2
RESISTANCE TO THE DEPARTMENT.

02:26:17.369 --> 02:26:21.539 region:rollup2
IF YOU SEPARATE DO IT BY D. O.

02:26:19.304 --> 02:26:23.141 region:rollup2
M. DEPARTMENT OPERATION MANUAL

02:26:21.539 --> 02:26:25.076 region:rollup2
OR BUT BY EDICT WELL THAT'S NOT

02:26:23.141 --> 02:26:26.177 region:rollup2
REALLY PERMIT. AND IT DOESN'T

02:26:25.076 --> 02:26:26.811 region:rollup2
AND AND THE REASON I'M PUSHING

02:26:26.177 --> 02:26:29.848 region:rollup2
SO HARD.

02:26:26.811 --> 02:26:31.883 region:rollup2
THE BIGGEST PROBLEM.

02:26:29.848 --> 02:26:32.784 region:rollup2
IN SOCIETY IN CALIFORNIA BUT

02:26:31.883 --> 02:26:33.718 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR IN THE AREA THE MOST

02:26:32.784 --> 02:26:36.321 region:rollup2
AFFECTED.

02:26:33.718 --> 02:26:39.457 region:rollup2
THERE'S NO TRUST.

02:26:36.321 --> 02:26:40.458 region:rollup2
THE AGENCY IS NOT TRUST.

02:26:39.457 --> 02:26:42.527 region:rollup2
AND I'LL SAY THAT SOMEONE

02:26:40.458 --> 02:26:43.795 region:rollup2
GALLAGHER AND I DON'T.

02:26:42.527 --> 02:26:45.530 region:rollup2
TRUST YOU EITHER IN MANY

02:26:43.795 --> 02:26:46.965 region:rollup2
RESPECTS WE LIKE YOU PERSONALLY.

02:26:45.530 --> 02:26:48.300 region:rollup2
AND EVEN GREAT UNDER THE

02:26:46.965 --> 02:26:50.101 region:rollup2
PRESSURE YOU HAVE CUT TO CONTEND

02:26:48.300 --> 02:26:51.569 region:rollup2
WITH INCREDIBLY.

02:26:50.101 --> 02:26:52.971 region:rollup2
BUT THERE'S NO TRUST IN THAT HAS

02:26:51.569 --> 02:26:54.306 region:rollup2
GOT TO BE ELEVATED AND IT'S GOT

02:26:52.971 --> 02:26:56.174 region:rollup2
TO BE ELEVATED IN THE WAY THAT

02:26:54.306 --> 02:26:57.876 region:rollup2
PEOPLE CAN BE ASSURED THAT IT'S

02:26:56.174 --> 02:26:59.377 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE SUSTAINING. SO I

02:26:57.876 --> 02:27:01.413 region:rollup2
ENCOURAGE YOU TO DO WHAT YOU CAN

02:26:59.377 --> 02:27:01.980 region:rollup2
AND REGULATION.

02:27:01.413 --> 02:27:02.514 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT ADMINISTRATIVE

02:27:01.980 --> 02:27:04.416 region:rollup2
PROCEDURE PROCESS IS VERY

02:27:02.514 --> 02:27:06.718 region:rollup2
FORMAL.

02:27:04.416 --> 02:27:07.819 region:rollup2
AND THE PUBLIC DOES HAVE INPUT.

02:27:06.718 --> 02:27:09.754 region:rollup2
AND YOU CAN'T CHANGE IT WITHOUT

02:27:07.819 --> 02:27:11.623 region:rollup2
DOING ANOTHER REGULATION.

02:27:09.754 --> 02:27:13.124 region:rollup2
AND MOST IMPORTANTLY WHATEVER

02:27:11.623 --> 02:27:14.926 region:rollup2
YOU DO HAS GOT TO HAVE A

02:27:13.124 --> 02:27:17.629 region:rollup2
STATUTORY FOUNDATION

02:27:14.926 --> 02:27:19.798 region:rollup2
SO PLEASE DO. CONSIDER THAT.

02:27:17.629 --> 02:27:21.066 region:rollup2
AS WE PROCEED AND LET JUST LET

02:27:19.798 --> 02:27:23.234 region:rollup2
ME EMPHASIZE THAT THAT ISSUE.

02:27:21.066 --> 02:27:23.702 region:rollup2
OF THE TRUST.

02:27:23.234 --> 02:27:27.205 region:rollup2
AND THEN THE THAT. THE

02:27:23.702 --> 02:27:29.607 region:rollup2
SILTATION.

02:27:27.205 --> 02:27:30.975 region:rollup2
AND DREDGING OF THE CHANNELS.

02:27:29.607 --> 02:27:32.877 region:rollup2
THIS IS BEEN A BIG ISSUE THOSE

02:27:30.975 --> 02:27:34.079 region:rollup2
AFFECTED OUR FISHERY.

02:27:32.877 --> 02:27:36.014 region:rollup2
AND WE GOT A HECK OF A PROBLEM

02:27:34.079 --> 02:27:37.749 region:rollup2
THIS YEAR.

02:27:36.014 --> 02:27:39.751 region:rollup2
OF A GOOD WATER YEAR.

02:27:37.749 --> 02:27:40.819 region:rollup2
BUT A BAD YEAR FOR.

02:27:39.751 --> 02:27:42.387 region:rollup2
KIND OF DESTROYING.

02:27:40.819 --> 02:27:44.456 region:rollup2
HABITAT.

02:27:42.387 --> 02:27:46.157 region:rollup2
FOR THE REWRITE.

02:27:44.456 --> 02:27:48.193 region:rollup2
AND IS NOT GOING TO BE A PART OF

02:27:46.157 --> 02:27:50.328 region:rollup2
YOUR PLAN.

02:27:48.193 --> 02:27:52.130 region:rollup2
DREDGING PARTS UP AND DOWN THAT

02:27:50.328 --> 02:27:53.264 region:rollup2
RIVER NOW YOU DREDGED IN FRONT

02:27:52.130 --> 02:27:54.966 region:rollup2
AT THE FOOT OF THE DAM AND

02:27:53.264 --> 02:27:55.867 region:rollup2
THAT'S ALL OUT.

02:27:54.966 --> 02:27:57.969 region:rollup2
BUT DOWNSTREAM THERE'S AN AWFUL

02:27:55.867 --> 02:27:59.504 region:rollup2
LOT OF.

02:27:57.969 --> 02:28:02.240 region:rollup2
BUT OF SELF.

02:27:59.504 --> 02:28:04.075 region:rollup2
AND ACTUALLY YOU HAVE THE UP THE

02:28:02.240 --> 02:28:06.478 region:rollup2
SNAG.

02:28:04.075 --> 02:28:07.212 region:rollup2
MANY TREES WE WATCHING GO BY IN

02:28:06.478 --> 02:28:09.247 region:rollup2
FRONT OF OUR HOUSE.

02:28:07.212 --> 02:28:11.015 region:rollup2
RIGHT DOWN THE RIVER.

02:28:09.247 --> 02:28:12.417 region:rollup2
THEY HANG UP AND THINGS THAT GO

02:28:11.015 --> 02:28:13.952 region:rollup2
BUMP ON THAT WITH IS THAT GOING

02:28:12.417 --> 02:28:16.187 region:rollup2
TO BE A PART OF ADDRESSING THESE

02:28:13.952 --> 02:28:18.590 region:rollup2
ISSUES. BUT SOMETHING REGARDING

02:28:16.187 --> 02:28:20.291 region:rollup2
GETTING THAT SILT AND THOSE.

02:28:18.590 --> 02:28:23.661 region:rollup2
TREES OUT OF THE LA RIVER

02:28:20.291 --> 02:28:25.263 region:rollup2
CHANNEL.

02:28:23.661 --> 02:28:26.164 region:rollup2
SO I THINK THE WAY HAVE BEEN

02:28:25.263 --> 02:28:27.465 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT THIS AND AGAIN I'M

02:28:26.164 --> 02:28:29.167 region:rollup2
SORRY I'M NOT GONNA GIVE YOU AN

02:28:27.465 --> 02:28:30.635 region:rollup2
ABSOLUTE YES OR NO AT AT THIS

02:28:29.167 --> 02:28:32.570 region:rollup2
POINT BUT IT'S IT'S KIND OF.

02:28:30.635 --> 02:28:34.806 region:rollup2
RELATED SCHOOL SO WE HAVE YOU

02:28:32.570 --> 02:28:36.407 region:rollup2
KNOW OBVIOUSLY DAM SAFETY.

02:28:34.806 --> 02:28:37.976 region:rollup2
AND THE FACILITIES UP THERE

02:28:36.407 --> 02:28:38.943 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING.

02:28:37.976 --> 02:28:39.744 region:rollup2
THING THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING

02:28:38.943 --> 02:28:40.979 region:rollup2
ABOUT WITH THE PRINCE AKEEM

02:28:39.744 --> 02:28:43.348 region:rollup2
REPORT THAT WE'RE GONNA TO SET

02:28:40.979 --> 02:28:44.783 region:rollup2
INTO MOTION. THERE'S ALSO THE

02:28:43.348 --> 02:28:46.484 region:rollup2
LICENSE THAT.

02:28:44.783 --> 02:28:48.820 region:rollup2
BRINGS AND OTHER ELEMENTS NOT

02:28:46.484 --> 02:28:51.322 region:rollup2
HOME ENTIRELY UNRELATED BUT YOU

02:28:48.820 --> 02:28:52.323 region:rollup2
KNOW. KIND OF.

02:28:51.322 --> 02:28:54.025 region:rollup2
THE ADDED BENEFIT OF

02:28:52.323 --> 02:28:54.926 region:rollup2
IMPROVEMENTS AND THEN. THE

02:28:54.025 --> 02:28:56.494 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION THAT WE'VE BEEN

02:28:54.926 --> 02:28:57.729 region:rollup2
HAVING WITH THE COALITION THAT

02:28:56.494 --> 02:28:59.898 region:rollup2
WE WILL CONTINUE HAVE I KIND OF

02:28:57.729 --> 02:29:01.466 region:rollup2
THINK OF RIGHT NOW IS THAT THIRD

02:28:59.898 --> 02:29:03.168 region:rollup2
LEG OF THE STOOL. THERE ARE

02:29:01.466 --> 02:29:04.102 region:rollup2
ELEMENTS THAT ARE OBVIOUSLY

02:29:03.168 --> 02:29:05.804 region:rollup2
RELATED.

02:29:04.102 --> 02:29:07.172 region:rollup2
TO THE OTHER TWO BUT I THINK

02:29:05.804 --> 02:29:08.673 region:rollup2
WE'RE STILL AT A POINT WHERE WE

02:29:07.172 --> 02:29:10.308 region:rollup2
HAVE TO FIGURE OUT.

02:29:08.673 --> 02:29:11.876 region:rollup2
IF THEY'RE NOT HOW DO WE MOVE

02:29:10.308 --> 02:29:13.178 region:rollup2
FORWARD WITH THEM TO MAKE

02:29:11.876 --> 02:29:14.913 region:rollup2
IMPROVEMENTS IN THE AND FOR ME

02:29:13.178 --> 02:29:16.848 region:rollup2
I'M STILL KEEPING THAT ONE.

02:29:14.913 --> 02:29:17.615 region:rollup2
SENTIMENT REMOVAL MAYBE THINGS

02:29:16.848 --> 02:29:20.385 region:rollup2
LIKE SNAGS.

02:29:17.615 --> 02:29:21.019 region:rollup2
IN THAT.

02:29:20.385 --> 02:29:23.388 region:rollup2
THIRD LEG.- UNTIL WE CAN REALLY

02:29:21.019 --> 02:29:25.023 region:rollup2
SORT OUT

02:29:23.388 --> 02:29:26.458 region:rollup2
HOW OLD.

02:29:25.023 --> 02:29:28.593 region:rollup2
HOW WE CAN MOVE AHEAD WHAT KIND

02:29:26.458 --> 02:29:29.427 region:rollup2
OF ENHANCEMENTS IMPROVEMENTS

02:29:28.593 --> 02:29:31.729 region:rollup2
COULD BE MADE THERE BECAUSE IT'S

02:29:29.427 --> 02:29:32.997 region:rollup2
JUST? IT IT DOESN'T CLEANLY FIT

02:29:31.729 --> 02:29:35.967 region:rollup2
JUST YET AND TO THE OTHER TWO

02:29:32.997 --> 02:29:37.602 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S THAT'S BEEN.

02:29:35.967 --> 02:29:39.470 region:rollup2
LAST POINT I'D MAKE IS IT AND I

02:29:37.602 --> 02:29:40.538 region:rollup2
APPRECIATE THE YEAR AGREEMENT TO

02:29:39.470 --> 02:29:42.841 region:rollup2
WORK WITH ME ON THIS CONCEPT.

02:29:40.538 --> 02:29:44.309 region:rollup2
IT'S OVERSIGHT.

02:29:42.841 --> 02:29:46.144 region:rollup2
AND IN THAT GOVERNS EVERYTHING

02:29:44.309 --> 02:29:48.046 region:rollup2
BUT ONE ASPECT OFTHE OVERSIGHT

02:29:46.144 --> 02:29:50.748 region:rollup2
THAT IS NECESSARY IS LOCAL.

02:29:48.046 --> 02:29:51.583 region:rollup2
INVOLVEMENT.

02:29:50.748 --> 02:29:52.784 region:rollup2
THE PEOPLE WHO WERE MOST

02:29:51.583 --> 02:29:54.686 region:rollup2
AFFECTED BY WHAT GOES ON WITH

02:29:52.784 --> 02:29:55.920 region:rollup2
THE DAM.

02:29:54.686 --> 02:29:57.121 region:rollup2
AND A LOT MORE THAN JUST A

02:29:55.920 --> 02:29:59.390 region:rollup2
HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT THOUSAND.

02:29:57.121 --> 02:30:00.892 region:rollup2
ARE AFFECTED BY IT.

02:29:59.390 --> 02:30:02.393 region:rollup2
AND IN FACT IT'S THE KIND OF THE

02:30:00.892 --> 02:30:05.196 region:rollup2
KEY OF THE WHOLE STATE WATER

02:30:02.393 --> 02:30:06.030 region:rollup2
PROJECT SO MANY MILLIONS.

02:30:05.196 --> 02:30:07.799 region:rollup2
ARE AFFECTED BY BUT I HAVE

02:30:06.030 --> 02:30:09.901 region:rollup2
SUGGESTED.

02:30:07.799 --> 02:30:11.369 region:rollup2
SOME KIND OF A.

02:30:09.901 --> 02:30:12.871 region:rollup2
NOT A FORMAL REGULATORY

02:30:11.369 --> 02:30:14.906 region:rollup2
AUTHORITY WE DO NOT NEED ANYMORE

02:30:12.871 --> 02:30:18.376 region:rollup2
OF THOSE.

02:30:14.906 --> 02:30:19.177 region:rollup2
BUT A BODY PROSCRIBED BY LAW.

02:30:18.376 --> 02:30:21.079 region:rollup2
WHERE BY PERIODICALLY THAT

02:30:19.177 --> 02:30:22.780 region:rollup2
ENTITY NAY EACH?

02:30:21.079 --> 02:30:24.849 region:rollup2
THE TALKS ABOUT THE ISSUES

02:30:22.780 --> 02:30:27.452 region:rollup2
RELATED. TO THE OPERATION AND

02:30:24.849 --> 02:30:28.753 region:rollup2
THE CONDUCT OF THE DAM.

02:30:27.452 --> 02:30:30.522 region:rollup2
WE GET SOMETHING BACK IN THE

02:30:28.753 --> 02:30:31.556 region:rollup2
EIGHTIES CALLED OF.

02:30:30.522 --> 02:30:33.825 region:rollup2

AS A SYSTEM.

02:35:42.733 --> 02:35:45.036 region:rollup2

02:35:46.737 --> 02:35:51.309 region:rollup2
HOWEVER INSPECTIONS ALONE ARE

02:35:48.372 --> 02:35:52.176 region:rollup2
NOT ENOUGH TO CONNECT THE DOTS.

02:35:51.309 --> 02:35:54.912 region:rollup2

BUT THAT AGAIN IN ITSELF WILL

02:36:05.323 --> 02:36:09.694 region:rollup2
NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM.

02:36:07.992 --> 02:36:11.696 region:rollup2
SYSTEMATIC ISSUES CAN ONLY BE

02:36:19.370 --> 02:36:22.406 region:rollup2
REEVALUATION PROGRAM.

02:36:21.239 --> 02:36:25.209 region:rollup2
TO INCLUDE SPILLWAYS AND OTHER

02:36:22.406 --> 02:36:26.043 region:rollup2
PERTINENT STRUCTURES.

02:36:25.209 --> 02:36:27.979 region:rollup2
START DAM OWNERS OF NINETY THREE

02:36:26.043 --> 02:36:30.314 region:rollup2
DAMS

02:36:27.979 --> 02:36:31.716 region:rollup2
SPILLWAYS SIMILAR TO LIKE OR

02:36:30.314 --> 02:36:32.917 region:rollup2
RELATIVES HAVE BEEN ENGAGED AND

02:36:31.716 --> 02:36:34.051 region:rollup2
WE'RE WORKING CLOSELY WITH THEM

02:36:32.917 --> 02:36:35.686 region:rollup2
AND ARE INDEPENDENTLY EVALUATING

02:36:34.051 --> 02:36:38.389 region:rollup2
THEIR STRUCTURES AND THEIR

02:36:35.686 --> 02:36:39.290 region:rollup2
PERMIT STRUCTURES.

02:36:38.389 --> 02:36:41.392 region:rollup2
WITH MORE THAN HALF OF THE

02:36:39.290 --> 02:36:42.660 region:rollup2
JURISDICTIONAL DAMS.

02:36:41.392 --> 02:36:43.794 region:rollup2
BEING OVER FIFTY YEARS OLD WITH

02:36:42.660 --> 02:36:46.130 region:rollup2
AN AVERAGE AGE.

02:36:43.794 --> 02:36:47.231 region:rollup2
AB SEVENTY YEARS.

02:36:46.130 --> 02:36:48.899 region:rollup2
MANY DAMS WILL NEED SOME LEVEL

02:36:47.231 --> 02:36:51.369 region:rollup2
OF REPAIR.

02:36:48.899 --> 02:36:53.371 region:rollup2
AND FOR SOME FOR REPLACEMENT.

02:36:51.369 --> 02:36:55.139 region:rollup2
THIS WILL EQUATE TO BILLIONS OF

02:36:53.371 --> 02:36:56.674 region:rollup2
DOLLARS NEEDED TO REPAIR. AND

02:36:55.139 --> 02:36:57.575 region:rollup2
BRING THESE FACILITIES UP TO

02:36:56.674 --> 02:37:00.011 region:rollup2
CURRENT STANDARDS AND

02:36:57.575 --> 02:37:01.679 region:rollup2
OPERATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS.

02:37:00.011 --> 02:37:03.180 region:rollup2
HOWEVER GIVEN THE DIVERSITY OF

02:37:01.679 --> 02:37:06.751 region:rollup2
DAM OWNERSHIP. FROM A SINGLE

02:37:03.180 --> 02:37:07.852 region:rollup2
FARMER TWO MAJOR UTILITIES.

02:37:06.751 --> 02:37:09.654 region:rollup2
AND THERE VARYING FINANCIAL AND

02:37:07.852 --> 02:37:11.355 region:rollup2
TECHNICAL RESOURCES

02:37:09.654 --> 02:37:11.889 region:rollup2
MANY DAM OWNERS WILLBE

02:37:11.355 --> 02:37:12.990 region:rollup2
CHALLENGED IN FIXING THEIR

02:37:11.889 --> 02:37:15.126 region:rollup2
DOWNS.

02:37:12.990 --> 02:37:16.193 region:rollup2
AS IS CURRENTLY THE CASE TODAY.

02:37:15.126 --> 02:37:17.695 region:rollup2
THE RESULT IS THE FORCED

02:37:16.193 --> 02:37:18.863 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTATION OF RISK REDUCTION

02:37:17.695 --> 02:37:20.831 region:rollup2
MEASURES SUCH AS RESERVOIR

02:37:18.863 --> 02:37:21.565 region:rollup2
RESTRICTIONS.

02:37:20.831 --> 02:37:23.301 region:rollup2
PARTIAL OR FULL DRAINING OF

02:37:21.565 --> 02:37:24.535 region:rollup2
RESERVOIRS.

02:37:23.301 --> 02:37:26.003 region:rollup2
WHICH IN TURN RESULTS IN THE

02:37:24.535 --> 02:37:26.938 region:rollup2
LOSS OF NEEDED WATER SUPPLY IN

02:37:26.003 --> 02:37:29.840 region:rollup2
CRITICAL FLOOD.

02:37:26.938 --> 02:37:30.908 region:rollup2
PROTECTIONS STORAGE.

02:37:29.840 --> 02:37:33.077 region:rollup2
WELL WE'RE SHIFTING THE PARADIGM

02:37:30.908 --> 02:37:34.412 region:rollup2
OF THE NCP ACROSS CALIFORNIA AND

02:37:33.077 --> 02:37:35.947 region:rollup2
WORKING WITH OUR PARTNERS

02:37:34.412 --> 02:37:37.548 region:rollup2
NATIONALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY.

02:37:35.947 --> 02:37:39.383 region:rollup2
TO ACCOUNT FOR AND COUNTER THE

02:37:37.548 --> 02:37:40.151 region:rollup2
LESSONS LEARNED AND ORVILLE.

02:37:39.383 --> 02:37:41.385 region:rollup2
WE MUST ALSO RECOGNIZE

02:37:40.151 --> 02:37:43.220 region:rollup2
INTELLECTUALLY OVERCOME THE

02:37:41.385 --> 02:37:44.055 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES AND BARRIERS IN

02:37:43.220 --> 02:37:45.690 region:rollup2
REPAIRING AND MAINTAINING OUR

02:37:44.055 --> 02:37:47.692 region:rollup2
DAMS.

02:37:45.690 --> 02:37:48.392 region:rollup2
WITH FUNDING PERMITTING RESEARCH

02:37:47.692 --> 02:37:50.528 region:rollup2
AND DAM ORDER AND SAFETY

02:37:48.392 --> 02:37:51.195 region:rollup2
EDUCATION.

02:37:50.528 --> 02:37:53.197 region:rollup2
SO WITH THAT I WANT TO TURN IT

02:37:51.195 --> 02:37:54.131 region:rollup2
OVER TO SHARE AND WHO WILL GO

02:37:53.197 --> 02:37:54.398 region:rollup2
FOR THE FLIGHT DECK THAT YOU

02:37:54.131 --> 02:37:55.466 region:rollup2
GUYS HAVE.

02:37:54.398 --> 02:37:56.867 region:rollup2
IT.

02:37:55.466 --> 02:37:58.402 region:rollup2
IT IN YOUR PACKETS AND MOVE

02:37:56.867 --> 02:38:02.473 region:rollup2
ALONG THEN TO TINA.

02:37:58.402 --> 02:38:05.142 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

02:38:02.473 --> 02:38:05.743 region:rollup2
THANK YOU A GOOD AFTERNOON AND

02:38:05.142 --> 02:38:08.145 region:rollup2
THANK YOU FOR HAVING US HERE

02:38:05.743 --> 02:38:09.914 region:rollup2
TODAY. AND IN YOUR PACKET I HAVE

02:38:08.145 --> 02:38:11.148 region:rollup2
ABOUT TEN SLIDES NOW GO THROUGH

02:38:09.914 --> 02:38:13.918 region:rollup2
PRETTY RAPIDLY.

02:38:11.148 --> 02:38:15.019 region:rollup2
ERIC KINDA CAPTURE THE JUST OF

02:38:13.918 --> 02:38:16.687 region:rollup2
IT BED IT'S KINDA NICE TO SEE

02:38:15.019 --> 02:38:18.389 region:rollup2
SOME PHOTOS AND GRAPHICS TO GO

02:38:16.687 --> 02:38:20.491 region:rollup2
ALONG WITH THAT.

02:38:18.389 --> 02:38:22.159 region:rollup2
SO THE FIRST ONE IS OUR DAM

02:38:20.491 --> 02:38:23.594 region:rollup2
SAFETY PROGRAM THAT. BIG CHANGES

02:38:22.159 --> 02:38:25.062 region:rollup2
TO OUR PROGRAM HAVE OCCURRED

02:38:23.594 --> 02:38:26.897 region:rollup2
HISTORICALLY THROUGH BIG

02:38:25.062 --> 02:38:28.399 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT INCIDENCES AND AND

02:38:26.897 --> 02:38:30.167 region:rollup2
FAILURES.

02:38:28.399 --> 02:38:32.603 region:rollup2
AND WE STARTED OUR PROGRAM IN

02:38:30.167 --> 02:38:33.804 region:rollup2
NINETEEN TWENTY NINE AS A RESULT

02:38:32.603 --> 02:38:35.873 region:rollup2
OF THE SAINT FRANCIS STATE DAM

02:38:33.804 --> 02:38:36.607 region:rollup2
FAILURE THAT OCCURRED THE YEAR

02:38:35.873 --> 02:38:38.242 region:rollup2
PRIOR.

02:38:36.607 --> 02:38:39.143 region:rollup2
THAT DAM FAILURE WILL BE

02:38:38.242 --> 02:38:40.711 region:rollup2
HITTING ITS NINETIETH

02:38:39.143 --> 02:38:42.413 region:rollup2
ANNIVERSARY IN MARCH OF THIS

02:38:40.711 --> 02:38:43.447 region:rollup2
YEAR.

02:38:42.413 --> 02:38:45.116 region:rollup2
OVER FOUR HUNDRED PEOPLE LOST

02:38:43.447 --> 02:38:47.651 region:rollup2
THEIR LIVES.

02:38:45.116 --> 02:38:49.453 region:rollup2
AND ANOTHER BIG CHANGE SAID THAT

02:38:47.651 --> 02:38:51.455 region:rollup2
CHANGE BROUGHT ON THE REGULATION

02:38:49.453 --> 02:38:53.357 region:rollup2
OF ON SCREEN DANCE.

02:38:51.455 --> 02:38:54.759 region:rollup2
IN NINETEEN SIXTY THREE THERE IS

02:38:53.357 --> 02:38:55.326 region:rollup2
THE FAILURE OF THE OFF STREAM

02:38:54.759 --> 02:38:57.762 region:rollup2
BALDWIN HILLS DAM IN THE LA

02:38:55.326 --> 02:38:59.864 region:rollup2
AREA.

02:38:57.762 --> 02:39:02.533 region:rollup2
IN THAT CAUSED THE LOSS OF FIVE

02:38:59.864 --> 02:39:03.934 region:rollup2
FIVE PEOPLE LOST THEIR LIVES.

02:39:02.533 --> 02:39:05.069 region:rollup2
THIS AMENDED THE WATER COATING

02:39:03.934 --> 02:39:07.104 region:rollup2
NOW INCLUDE OFF STREAM

02:39:05.069 --> 02:39:09.106 region:rollup2
RESERVOIRS.

02:39:07.104 --> 02:39:11.175 region:rollup2
AND DOWN BELOW YOU'LL SEE LOWER

02:39:09.106 --> 02:39:12.977 region:rollup2
SAN FERNANDO WHICH AS MANY OF

02:39:11.175 --> 02:39:14.378 region:rollup2
YOU MAY BE FAMILIAR WITH. THIS

02:39:12.977 --> 02:39:16.614 region:rollup2
ONE WE HAVE THE LOWER SAN

02:39:14.378 --> 02:39:18.516 region:rollup2
FERNANDO EARTHQUAKE OCCURRED IN

02:39:16.614 --> 02:39:21.018 region:rollup2
NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE.

02:39:18.516 --> 02:39:22.953 region:rollup2
YOU'LL SEE THAT.

02:39:21.018 --> 02:39:24.955 region:rollup2
THERE'S EIGHTY THOUSAND PEOPLE

02:39:22.953 --> 02:39:27.324 region:rollup2
DOWNSTREAM OF THE STAND AND WHAT

02:39:24.955 --> 02:39:29.293 region:rollup2
HAPPENED. LUCKILY AT THE TIME.

02:39:27.324 --> 02:39:30.961 region:rollup2
R. DIVISION HAD HAD THIS DAMN

02:39:29.293 --> 02:39:32.129 region:rollup2
RESTRICTED ACTUALLY FOR A

02:39:30.961 --> 02:39:33.531 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT REASON IT WASN'T

02:39:32.129 --> 02:39:35.900 region:rollup2
SEISMIC REASON.

02:39:33.531 --> 02:39:37.368 region:rollup2
SO IT WAS RESTRICTED AND THE DAM

02:39:35.900 --> 02:39:38.969 region:rollup2
OWNER ACTUALLY HAD HELD THE

02:39:37.368 --> 02:39:42.039 region:rollup2
WATER EVEN LOWER.

02:39:38.969 --> 02:39:43.441 region:rollup2
AND WHEN THE EARTHQUAKE OCCURRED

02:39:42.039 --> 02:39:44.408 region:rollup2
HAD DUE TO HOW THIS DAM WAS

02:39:43.441 --> 02:39:47.077 region:rollup2
BUILT IT.

02:39:44.408 --> 02:39:48.746 region:rollup2
LIQUEFIED IN THE WHOLE ENTIRE

02:39:47.077 --> 02:39:50.181 region:rollup2
STE UPSTREAM SLOPES LATE INTO

02:39:48.746 --> 02:39:51.515 region:rollup2
THE RESERVOIR.

02:39:50.181 --> 02:39:52.750 region:rollup2
AND SO THE WATER LEVEL HAD BEEN

02:39:51.515 --> 02:39:55.252 region:rollup2
DOWN THIRTY FIVE FEET AT THAT

02:39:52.750 --> 02:39:56.153 region:rollup2
TIME IN YOU CAN SEE THIS IS THAT

02:39:55.252 --> 02:39:58.289 region:rollup2
THE RESULT THAT THE END OF THE

02:39:56.153 --> 02:39:59.957 region:rollup2
EARTH QUAKE. IT WAS WITHIN FEET

02:39:58.289 --> 02:40:01.725 region:rollup2
OF OVERTOPPING AND THAT'S WHAT

02:39:59.957 --> 02:40:03.194 region:rollup2
TRIGGERED THIS EVACUATION.

02:40:01.725 --> 02:40:04.829 region:rollup2
SO TO KEEP IN MIND WITH

02:40:03.194 --> 02:40:06.197 region:rollup2
EARTHQUAKES AND LIKE WHAT WE SAW

02:40:04.829 --> 02:40:08.666 region:rollup2
WITH ORVILLE ON THE FLIGHT EVENT

02:40:06.197 --> 02:40:09.767 region:rollup2
THERE IS NO TIME TO EVACUATE.

02:40:08.666 --> 02:40:14.171 region:rollup2
EARTHQUAKES HAPPEN

02:40:09.767 --> 02:40:15.739 region:rollup2
INSTANTANEOUSLY.

02:40:14.171 --> 02:40:17.708 region:rollup2
GOING ON TO THE NEXT SLIDE IS

02:40:15.739 --> 02:40:19.477 region:rollup2
JUST A PICTURE OF OUR OVERALL

02:40:17.708 --> 02:40:21.479 region:rollup2
INVENTORY WE HAVE TWELVE HUNDRED

02:40:19.477 --> 02:40:22.413 region:rollup2
FORTY NINE DANCE. YOU'LL SEE IN

02:40:21.479 --> 02:40:24.148 region:rollup2
THE LITTLE CHART THE VERY.

02:40:22.413 --> 02:40:25.616 region:rollup2
.

02:40:24.148 --> 02:40:27.384 region:rollup2
FROM ORVILLE BEING OUR HIGHEST

02:40:25.616 --> 02:40:29.253 region:rollup2
IS SEVEN HUNDRED SEVENTY AND

02:40:27.384 --> 02:40:31.388 region:rollup2
THEY GO DOWN TO.

02:40:29.253 --> 02:40:32.156 region:rollup2
VERY SMALL DAMS. HOWEVER WE DO

02:40:31.388 --> 02:40:35.292 region:rollup2
HAVE

02:40:32.156 --> 02:40:37.328 region:rollup2
AND.

02:40:35.292 --> 02:40:39.263 region:rollup2
I HAVE VERY VARIETY OF TYPES OF

02:40:37.328 --> 02:40:41.732 region:rollup2
DAMS TO.

02:40:39.263 --> 02:40:43.501 region:rollup2
AT OUR OWNERSHIP OR OWNERSHIP IS

02:40:41.732 --> 02:40:44.969 region:rollup2
ALSO VERY VARIED ACROSS THE

02:40:43.501 --> 02:40:46.937 region:rollup2
STATE YOU'LL SEE THE CHART ON

02:40:44.969 --> 02:40:49.440 region:rollup2
THE RIGHT. AND ALSO WHO HAS

02:40:46.937 --> 02:40:51.108 region:rollup2
EXTREMELY HIGH IN HIGH DAMS.

02:40:49.440 --> 02:40:52.910 region:rollup2
WE HAVE SOME OF THE LARGEST DAMS

02:40:51.108 --> 02:40:55.913 region:rollup2
IN THE NATION THE MOST COMPLEX

02:40:52.910 --> 02:40:57.715 region:rollup2
GEOLOGY AND VERY COMPLEX SEISMIC

02:40:55.913 --> 02:40:59.583 region:rollup2
REGIME. AND WITH THEIR OWNERS

02:40:57.715 --> 02:41:01.752 region:rollup2
THEY VERY BOTH TECHNICALLY AND

02:40:59.583 --> 02:41:03.821 region:rollup2
IN THEIR RESOURCES FOR FINANCIAL

02:41:01.752 --> 02:41:05.422 region:rollup2
SUPPORT.

02:41:03.821 --> 02:41:07.458 region:rollup2
ON THE NEXT SLIDE LITTLE BIT

02:41:05.422 --> 02:41:10.261 region:rollup2
ABOUT EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS

02:41:07.458 --> 02:41:12.163 region:rollup2
SO I CALIFORNIA ACTUALLY PRIOR

02:41:10.261 --> 02:41:13.731 region:rollup2
TO THE OROVILLE EVENT HAD BEEN

02:41:12.163 --> 02:41:15.1000 region:rollup2
ENCOURAGING DAM OWNERS TO HAVE

02:41:13.731 --> 02:41:17.501 region:rollup2
THE KEYS IT WASN'T REQUIRED.

02:41:15.1000 --> 02:41:19.403 region:rollup2
THOUGH WE KNEW THE IMPORTANCE

02:41:17.501 --> 02:41:21.338 region:rollup2
OF IT AND PROBABLY AT THAT TIME

02:41:19.403 --> 02:41:23.174 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA WAS LAGGING IN THE

02:41:21.338 --> 02:41:24.808 region:rollup2
NATION ON THIS.

02:41:23.174 --> 02:41:26.076 region:rollup2
SO WE ENCOURAGE THEM WE SET OUT

02:41:24.808 --> 02:41:28.579 region:rollup2
TO.

02:41:26.076 --> 02:41:30.548 region:rollup2
NATIONALLY A LEARN ABOUT IT

02:41:28.579 --> 02:41:31.815 region:rollup2
INUNDATION MAPPING TOOL THAT

02:41:30.548 --> 02:41:33.684 region:rollup2
WE'VE BEEN YOU UTILIZING AND

02:41:31.815 --> 02:41:34.585 region:rollup2
WE'RE ACTUALLY HELPING DAM

02:41:33.684 --> 02:41:35.786 region:rollup2
OWNERS.

02:41:34.585 --> 02:41:38.222 region:rollup2
DUTY EIGHT KEYS.

02:41:35.786 --> 02:41:39.223 region:rollup2
SO FROM THAT WE AFTER THEY WERE

02:41:38.222 --> 02:41:40.658 region:rollup2
RELEVANT NOW WE HAVE THE

02:41:39.223 --> 02:41:41.992 region:rollup2
AUTHORITY TO REQUIRE INUNDATION

02:41:40.658 --> 02:41:44.428 region:rollup2
MAPS WE LEARNED A LOT FROM

02:41:41.992 --> 02:41:46.197 region:rollup2
MARVEL WE NEED SPECIALIZED MAPS

02:41:44.428 --> 02:41:47.932 region:rollup2
FOR CRITICAL PRINCES. SO THAT

02:41:46.197 --> 02:41:50.334 region:rollup2
YOU EVACUATION SCANNED BE

02:41:47.932 --> 02:41:52.069 region:rollup2
CONTAINED WITHIN THE BOUNDARIES.

02:41:50.334 --> 02:41:53.804 region:rollup2
AND NOT DISPLACED PEOPLE WHO

02:41:52.069 --> 02:41:54.705 region:rollup2
DON'T NEED TO BE DISPLACED.

02:41:53.804 --> 02:41:56.674 region:rollup2
AND.

02:41:54.705 --> 02:41:58.175 region:rollup2
.

02:41:56.674 --> 02:41:59.877 region:rollup2
THIRTEEN A NEXT MEAN SHE HAS NOW

02:41:58.175 --> 02:42:00.377 region:rollup2
THE AUTHORITY TO REVIEW AND

02:41:59.877 --> 02:42:01.912 region:rollup2
APPROVE.

02:42:00.377 --> 02:42:03.681 region:rollup2
HE PEES

02:42:01.912 --> 02:42:05.916 region:rollup2
DID PICTURE YOU SEE HERE IS

02:42:03.681 --> 02:42:08.319 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY PARRIS DAM IT'S ONE IDW

02:42:05.916 --> 02:42:09.620 region:rollup2
R. STAMP. AND YOU'LL SEE WE HAVE

02:42:08.319 --> 02:42:12.489 region:rollup2
WE HAVE JUST DEVELOPMENT

02:42:09.620 --> 02:42:14.692 region:rollup2
OCCURRING ALL ACROSS THE STATE

02:42:12.489 --> 02:42:16.794 region:rollup2
JUST AT AT DID THE DOWNSTREAM

02:42:14.692 --> 02:42:18.229 region:rollup2
TEARS OF THE STANDS TWENTY YEARS

02:42:16.794 --> 02:42:20.397 region:rollup2
AGO THIS DbN LIKE LIKE THIS APP

02:42:18.229 --> 02:42:22.032 region:rollup2
AT PARIS SO. WE DO HAVE A LOT OF

02:42:20.397 --> 02:42:24.235 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT IN CALIFORNIA IN

02:42:22.032 --> 02:42:25.202 region:rollup2
REAL I HAVE A LOT OF LARGE DAMS

02:42:24.235 --> 02:42:26.570 region:rollup2
BETTER UPSTREAM OF THESE

02:42:25.202 --> 02:42:29.206 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES EMERGENCY

02:42:26.570 --> 02:42:30.874 region:rollup2
PREPAREDNESS IS VERY IMPORTANT.

02:42:29.206 --> 02:42:32.710 region:rollup2
THE NEXT SLIDE IS JUST A QUICK

02:42:30.874 --> 02:42:33.844 region:rollup2
SLIDE SHOWING OUR OVERVIEW. OF

02:42:32.710 --> 02:42:36.447 region:rollup2
WE ARE ABLE TO LAUNCH THIS

02:42:33.844 --> 02:42:38.549 region:rollup2
PROGRAM VERY RAPIDLY THIS YEAR

02:42:36.447 --> 02:42:40.517 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE ALREADY HAD BEEN

02:42:38.549 --> 02:42:42.319 region:rollup2
ENGAGED WITH OWNERS ON MAPS IN

02:42:40.517 --> 02:42:44.655 region:rollup2
THE EIGHTIES. WE ALREADY HAVE

02:42:42.319 --> 02:42:46.523 region:rollup2
THE TOOL ESTABLISHED AND WE HAVE

02:42:44.655 --> 02:42:47.491 region:rollup2
A VERY STRUCTURED PROCESSAND

02:42:46.523 --> 02:42:49.460 region:rollup2
HOW WE DO OUR DAM REVIEWS

02:42:47.491 --> 02:42:51.595 region:rollup2
EMERGES FOLLOWING A VERY SIMILAR

02:42:49.460 --> 02:42:53.063 region:rollup2
MECHANISM TO GET THE PROGRAM UP

02:42:51.595 --> 02:42:54.598 region:rollup2
AND RUNNING.

02:42:53.063 --> 02:42:57.468 region:rollup2
L. LITERALLY WE HAVE BEEN

02:42:54.598 --> 02:42:59.903 region:rollup2
INUNDATED WITH INUNDATION MAPS.

02:42:57.468 --> 02:43:01.538 region:rollup2
IN DECEMBER THEY BECOME AND

02:42:59.903 --> 02:43:03.173 region:rollup2
BOXES TO US AND.

02:43:01.538 --> 02:43:05.809 region:rollup2
AND I KNOW KALAYEH SAYS

02:43:03.173 --> 02:43:08.612 region:rollup2
RECEIVING THE SAME BOXES.

02:43:05.809 --> 02:43:10.414 region:rollup2
ON THE NEXT SLIDE SLIDE SIX IS

02:43:08.612 --> 02:43:12.416 region:rollup2
JUST A QUICK STATUS OF OUR

02:43:10.414 --> 02:43:14.818 region:rollup2
INUNDATION MAPPING PROGRAM.

02:43:12.416 --> 02:43:15.019 region:rollup2
I DAM OWNERS ARE VERY ENGAGED IN

02:43:14.818 --> 02:43:16.353 region:rollup2
THIS.

02:43:15.019 --> 02:43:18.389 region:rollup2
THAT THEY'RE ON THE PHONE TWO

02:43:16.353 --> 02:43:20.124 region:rollup2
S. QUITE QUITE A BIT. TRYING TO

02:43:18.389 --> 02:43:21.792 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THE REQUIREMENTS IN

02:43:20.124 --> 02:43:23.761 region:rollup2
WHAT THEY NEED TO DO WHAT THE

02:43:21.792 --> 02:43:25.429 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS ARE FOR THE MAPS IN

02:43:23.761 --> 02:43:27.064 region:rollup2
THE TIME LINES.

02:43:25.429 --> 02:43:27.831 region:rollup2
WE KNOW THAT SOME DAM OWNERS

02:43:27.064 --> 02:43:29.566 region:rollup2
LIKELY WILL NOT MEET THESE

02:43:27.831 --> 02:43:31.301 region:rollup2
DEADLINES.

02:43:29.566 --> 02:43:34.204 region:rollup2
AS SOME OF THEM DID NOT HAVE ANY

02:43:31.301 --> 02:43:36.140 region:rollup2
AP IN MATH IN PLACE OF WHEN THE

02:43:34.204 --> 02:43:37.875 region:rollup2
LEGISLATION WAS APPROVED.

02:43:36.140 --> 02:43:40.511 region:rollup2
AND THEY ARE WORKING TO TO MEET

02:43:37.875 --> 02:43:42.046 region:rollup2
THE DEADLINE SO SO OUR GOAL IS

02:43:40.511 --> 02:43:43.781 region:rollup2
TO REALLY WORK WITH DAM OWNERS

02:43:42.046 --> 02:43:45.349 region:rollup2
AND TO GET E. AP'S BECAUSE WE

02:43:43.781 --> 02:43:47.351 region:rollup2
MEDIATE HE'S COMING WE NEED TO

02:43:45.349 --> 02:43:48.719 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE. THAT THERE APPROVED

02:43:47.351 --> 02:43:50.854 region:rollup2
IT SO THAT THEY'RE CORRECT IN

02:43:48.719 --> 02:43:52.656 region:rollup2
ACCURATE IN CAN BE IN PLACE OF

02:43:50.854 --> 02:43:54.391 region:rollup2
AN EMERGENCY WERE TO OCCUR TO

02:43:52.656 --> 02:43:56.860 region:rollup2
PROTECT THE PUBLIC.

02:43:54.391 --> 02:43:59.830 region:rollup2
THE NEXT SLIDE IS SLIDE SEVEN.

02:43:56.860 --> 02:44:01.198 region:rollup2
THIS GOES BACK TO INSPECTIONS

02:43:59.830 --> 02:44:04.368 region:rollup2
AS WAS ALREADY DISCUSSED.

02:44:01.198 --> 02:44:06.670 region:rollup2
BY MR FRANCE.

02:44:04.368 --> 02:44:08.739 region:rollup2
INSPECTIONS IN OUR VIEW ARE ARE

02:44:06.670 --> 02:44:11.475 region:rollup2
VERY IMPORTANT.

02:44:08.739 --> 02:44:13.043 region:rollup2
BUT THEY'RE NOT THE AND ALL OF

02:44:11.475 --> 02:44:15.679 region:rollup2
YOU REALLY GOT IT DO YOU DEEP RE

02:44:13.043 --> 02:44:16.980 region:rollup2
EVALUATIONS TENDER STAND. BUT

02:44:15.679 --> 02:44:19.183 region:rollup2
ONE THING I WANT TO POINT OUT ON

02:44:16.980 --> 02:44:21.051 region:rollup2
INSPECTIONS IS IS THE VALUE THAT

02:44:19.183 --> 02:44:22.152 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE. IS THAT THEY MAKE

02:44:21.051 --> 02:44:23.620 region:rollup2
SURE THAT THE DAM OWNERS

02:44:22.152 --> 02:44:24.988 region:rollup2
OPERATING AND MAINTAINING THE

02:44:23.620 --> 02:44:27.124 region:rollup2
DAM PROPERLY.

02:44:24.988 --> 02:44:28.992 region:rollup2
IN TWO THOUSAND SIX THERE IS A

02:44:27.124 --> 02:44:30.761 region:rollup2
DAM FAILURE IN HAWAII WHERE

02:44:28.992 --> 02:44:33.097 region:rollup2
SEVEN PEOPLE LOST THEIR LIVES.

02:44:30.761 --> 02:44:34.698 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE STATE I HAD NOT BEEN

02:44:33.097 --> 02:44:36.367 region:rollup2
OUT INSPECTING THE DAM IN NEW

02:44:34.698 --> 02:44:37.000 region:rollup2
DAM OWNER TOOK OVER AND THEY

02:44:36.367 --> 02:44:38.502 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY FILL THE SPILLWAY WITH

02:44:37.000 --> 02:44:40.704 region:rollup2
DIRT.

02:44:38.502 --> 02:44:42.172 region:rollup2
AND OF IN A STORM CAME THE DAM

02:44:40.704 --> 02:44:43.373 region:rollup2
OVERTOPPED BECAUSE THE SPILLWAY

02:44:42.172 --> 02:44:45.409 region:rollup2
WASN'T CLAIRE.

02:44:43.373 --> 02:44:48.011 region:rollup2
SO WIVES ARE STILL BEING LOST

02:44:45.409 --> 02:44:49.446 region:rollup2
AND. WITH INSPECTIONS NOT BEING

02:44:48.011 --> 02:44:51.048 region:rollup2
DONE SO INSPECTIONS ARE

02:44:49.446 --> 02:44:52.850 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT PART OF A GOOD DIEM

02:44:51.048 --> 02:44:53.917 region:rollup2
SAFETY PROGRAM.

02:44:52.850 --> 02:44:56.487 region:rollup2
WE ARE.

02:44:53.917 --> 02:44:57.621 region:rollup2
BEING A MORE AGGRESSIVE ON OUR

02:44:56.487 --> 02:44:59.289 region:rollup2
INSPECTIONS NOW WE'RE GONNA GIVE

02:44:57.621 --> 02:45:00.691 region:rollup2
DAM OWNERS LESS TIME TO GET

02:44:59.289 --> 02:45:02.826 region:rollup2
REPAIRS DONE.

02:45:00.691 --> 02:45:05.462 region:rollup2
WE'RE GONNA BE MONITORING THOSE

02:45:02.826 --> 02:45:07.431 region:rollup2
REPAIRS MORE CLOSELY. AND OF

02:45:05.462 --> 02:45:11.635 region:rollup2
FOLLOWING UP AND TRACKING THAT

02:45:07.431 --> 02:45:12.002 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING'S BEEN DONE PROPERLY.

02:45:11.635 --> 02:45:13.404 region:rollup2
SLIDE EIGHT IS.

02:45:12.002 --> 02:45:15.139 region:rollup2
.

02:45:13.404 --> 02:45:17.241 region:rollup2
A QUICK SNAPSHOT OF OUR

02:45:15.139 --> 02:45:18.876 region:rollup2
REEVALUATION PROGRAM RE

02:45:17.241 --> 02:45:21.278 region:rollup2
EVALUATIONS AREN'T NEW TO US. WE

02:45:18.876 --> 02:45:22.913 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN DOING THEM FOR DECADES

02:45:21.278 --> 02:45:24.782 region:rollup2
THAT WE STARTED WITH THE LOWER

02:45:22.913 --> 02:45:26.283 region:rollup2
SAN FERNANDO. HAD THAT WAS

02:45:24.782 --> 02:45:28.018 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY STE A CHANGE IN

02:45:26.283 --> 02:45:30.154 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY BECAUSE THE WHOLE

02:45:28.018 --> 02:45:32.289 region:rollup2
MECHANISM OF UNDERSTANDING HOW

02:45:30.154 --> 02:45:33.891 region:rollup2
SOILS LIQUEFY WAS LEARNED

02:45:32.289 --> 02:45:35.626 region:rollup2
THROUGH THIS EVENT.

02:45:33.891 --> 02:45:36.660 region:rollup2
AND ONCE THAT HAPPENED THE

02:45:35.626 --> 02:45:39.029 region:rollup2
DIVISION DID.

02:45:36.660 --> 02:45:40.697 region:rollup2
OF REEVALUATION STUDY OF ALL

02:45:39.029 --> 02:45:43.100 region:rollup2
THE HYDRAULIC PHIL DANCE IN THE

02:45:40.697 --> 02:45:45.669 region:rollup2
STATE. AND ALMOST NEARLY ALL OF

02:45:43.100 --> 02:45:47.104 region:rollup2
THOSE ARE ARE FIXED NOW THERE'S

02:45:45.669 --> 02:45:48.305 region:rollup2
A FEW.

02:45:47.104 --> 02:45:50.140 region:rollup2
STILL OUT THERE THAT THE DAM

02:45:48.305 --> 02:45:51.575 region:rollup2
OWNERS HAVE FINANCIAL RESOURCES

02:45:50.140 --> 02:45:53.443 region:rollup2
AND ARE NOT ABLE TO FIX BUT

02:45:51.575 --> 02:45:55.679 region:rollup2
THOSE ARE RESTRICTED.

02:45:53.443 --> 02:45:57.681 region:rollup2
AND NEXT UP WE HAD FULL SUMGAIT

02:45:55.679 --> 02:45:59.716 region:rollup2
FAILURE AND AGAIN WE EVALUATED

02:45:57.681 --> 02:46:02.452 region:rollup2
TWO HUNDRED DAMS.

02:45:59.716 --> 02:46:04.922 region:rollup2
TWO HUNDRED GATES IN THE STATE.

02:46:02.452 --> 02:46:06.557 region:rollup2
BUT WHAT WE HAVE BEEN DOING IS

02:46:04.922 --> 02:46:07.991 region:rollup2
IS CONTINUING ADVANCING AN

02:46:06.557 --> 02:46:08.559 region:rollup2
EARTHQUAKE ENGINEERING LIKE I

02:46:07.991 --> 02:46:10.294 region:rollup2
SAID.

02:46:08.559 --> 02:46:12.996 region:rollup2
EARTHQUAKES HAPPEN THERE'S NO

02:46:10.294 --> 02:46:14.097 region:rollup2
NOTICE WE HAVE SO ANY DAMS IN

02:46:12.996 --> 02:46:15.799 region:rollup2
THIS NOT JUST THE AGE OF THE

02:46:14.097 --> 02:46:17.501 region:rollup2
DAMS IT'S SIERRA THAT THEY WERE

02:46:15.799 --> 02:46:19.303 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTED AND. SO WHEN YOU

02:46:17.501 --> 02:46:20.470 region:rollup2
HAVE DANCE EVER CONSTRUCTED IN

02:46:19.303 --> 02:46:22.339 region:rollup2
THE AIR THEY DIDN'T UNDERSTAND

02:46:20.470 --> 02:46:23.674 region:rollup2
LIQUEFACTION YOU HAVE A LOT OF

02:46:22.339 --> 02:46:25.776 region:rollup2
SOILS UNDER THE DAMN SICK COULD

02:46:23.674 --> 02:46:28.679 region:rollup2
LIQUEFY. YOU HAVE SOILS WITHIN

02:46:25.776 --> 02:46:30.280 region:rollup2
THE DAM THE CA LIQUEFY SO IT'S

02:46:28.679 --> 02:46:33.016 region:rollup2
ON EARTH DAMS IT'S REALLY THAT

02:46:30.280 --> 02:46:34.618 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTION AT THE TIME THAT.

02:46:33.016 --> 02:46:37.921 region:rollup2
AND THE METHODOLOGIES THAT WERE

02:46:34.618 --> 02:46:40.724 region:rollup2
USED VERSUS A CONCRETE

02:46:37.921 --> 02:46:42.392 region:rollup2
STRUCTURES ARE WE SEE THAT

02:46:40.724 --> 02:46:43.160 region:rollup2
THAT'S AN AGING PROBLEM BUT IT.

02:46:42.392 --> 02:46:43.794 region:rollup2
BEEN ADDITION TO UNDERSTANDING

02:46:43.160 --> 02:46:45.395 region:rollup2
STANDARDS AND CODE REQUIREMENTS

02:46:43.794 --> 02:46:46.496 region:rollup2
TO.

02:46:45.395 --> 02:46:48.899 region:rollup2
AS SORT OUR CON OR EARTHQUAKE

02:46:46.496 --> 02:46:50.133 region:rollup2
ENGINEERING REEVALUATION PROGRAM

02:46:48.899 --> 02:46:51.802 region:rollup2
LOOKS AT EARTH DAMS CONCRETE

02:46:50.133 --> 02:46:53.203 region:rollup2
DAMS AND WE ALSO DO A PRINT AND

02:46:51.802 --> 02:46:55.072 region:rollup2
STRUCTURES LIKE OUTLET TOWERS

02:46:53.203 --> 02:46:56.607 region:rollup2
AND GATES.

02:46:55.072 --> 02:46:58.542 region:rollup2
AND THEN OBVIOUSLY WITH ORVILLE

02:46:56.607 --> 02:47:00.577 region:rollup2
WE STARTED THIS YEAR ANNEGRET

02:46:58.542 --> 02:47:02.546 region:rollup2
VERY AGGRESSIVE PROGRAM OF

02:47:00.577 --> 02:47:04.381 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT SPILLWAYS. AYE WE'RE

02:47:02.546 --> 02:47:06.283 region:rollup2
STARTING WITH THESE NINETY THREE

02:47:04.381 --> 02:47:07.851 region:rollup2
THIS IS A START.

02:47:06.283 --> 02:47:10.320 region:rollup2
THIS IS NOT THE END ALL IN OUR

02:47:07.851 --> 02:47:12.656 region:rollup2
INVENTORY WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE.

02:47:10.320 --> 02:47:14.057 region:rollup2
AT EACH YEAR TO GRAB ANOTHER

02:47:12.656 --> 02:47:16.326 region:rollup2
BALK AT OF OF DAMS THAT WE

02:47:14.057 --> 02:47:18.862 region:rollup2
CONSIDER THE HIGHEST PRIORITY.

02:47:16.326 --> 02:47:20.898 region:rollup2
AND GET THOSE OWNERS ENGAGED.

02:47:18.862 --> 02:47:21.465 region:rollup2
I DO WANT TO SAY AND I THINK

02:47:20.898 --> 02:47:22.699 region:rollup2
WE'LL GET TO IT ON THE NEXT

02:47:21.465 --> 02:47:24.935 region:rollup2
SLIDE.

02:47:22.699 --> 02:47:25.736 region:rollup2
AND THE OWNERS ARE VERY ENGAGED

02:47:24.935 --> 02:47:27.037 region:rollup2
IN THIS THIS.

02:47:25.736 --> 02:47:28.805 region:rollup2
YOU TALKED ABOUT HIM ARE YOU

02:47:27.037 --> 02:47:30.574 region:rollup2
AWAKE.

02:47:28.805 --> 02:47:32.743 region:rollup2
EVERY DAMN OWNER OUT THERE IS

02:47:30.574 --> 02:47:34.311 region:rollup2
AWAKE I WILL TELL YOU THAT. I WE

02:47:32.743 --> 02:47:36.880 region:rollup2
HAVE DIEM OWNERS ALREADY.

02:47:34.311 --> 02:47:38.549 region:rollup2
HAD ORVILLE NOT OCCURRED THE

02:47:36.880 --> 02:47:40.584 region:rollup2
WAY IT DID.

02:47:38.549 --> 02:47:42.219 region:rollup2
WE HAVE DIMINISH NOW. TELLING

02:47:40.584 --> 02:47:42.753 region:rollup2
US ARE GONNA BE REPLACING THEIR

02:47:42.219 --> 02:47:45.355 region:rollup2
SPILLWAYS.

02:47:42.753 --> 02:47:48.292 region:rollup2
THEY UNDERSTAND THE SEVERITY OF

02:47:45.355 --> 02:47:49.660 region:rollup2
THIS AND WHAT IT CAN LEAD TO SO

02:47:48.292 --> 02:47:50.861 region:rollup2
I'M THERE THAT THE HEIGHTENED

02:47:49.660 --> 02:47:52.162 region:rollup2
AWARENESS IS OF THIS IS OUT

02:47:50.861 --> 02:47:54.197 region:rollup2
THERE.

02:47:52.162 --> 02:47:55.666 region:rollup2
AND.

02:47:54.197 --> 02:47:57.768 region:rollup2
BUT I DO WANT TO SAY THESE DO

02:47:55.666 --> 02:47:58.669 region:rollup2
TAKE TIME. DOING THESE

02:47:57.768 --> 02:48:01.638 region:rollup2
EVALUATIONS.

02:47:58.669 --> 02:48:03.307 region:rollup2
REQUIRES US TO HAVE THEM GO OUT

02:48:01.638 --> 02:48:05.642 region:rollup2
AND DO DRILLING TO GET THE DATA.

02:48:03.307 --> 02:48:07.477 region:rollup2
AND AND TO REALLY UNDERSTAND

02:48:05.642 --> 02:48:09.413 region:rollup2
WHAT'S UNDER THERE AND HOW

02:48:07.477 --> 02:48:11.081 region:rollup2
SERIOUS IS IT IS IT SERIOUS

02:48:09.413 --> 02:48:12.082 region:rollup2
ENOUGH TO DO A FULL REPLACEMENT

02:48:11.081 --> 02:48:13.550 region:rollup2
IS A PARTIAL REPLACEMENT

02:48:12.082 --> 02:48:17.120 region:rollup2
SUFFICIENT.

02:48:13.550 --> 02:48:18.956 region:rollup2
AND SO THESE PROJECTS DO TAKE.

02:48:17.120 --> 02:48:20.591 region:rollup2
TIME TO EVALUATE AND THEN ONCE

02:48:18.956 --> 02:48:22.726 region:rollup2
IT'S DETERMINED TO GOES INTO

02:48:20.591 --> 02:48:24.795 region:rollup2
PLANNING THESE CAN TAKE A COUPLE

02:48:22.726 --> 02:48:26.063 region:rollup2
YEARS OF PLANNING. THEN THE PER

02:48:24.795 --> 02:48:28.398 region:rollup2
THERE'S OBVIOUSLY THE PERMITTING

02:48:26.063 --> 02:48:29.866 region:rollup2
PROCESS THAT THEY HAVE TO GO TO

02:48:28.398 --> 02:48:31.101 region:rollup2
AND THEN THE CONSTRUCTION SO YOU

GONNA BE DOING A COMPLETE AND

02:48:39.943 --> 02:48:43.013 region:rollup2
ALMOST DAM REPLACEMENT.

02:48:41.345 --> 02:48:44.181 region:rollup2
AND NOW THEY'RE GONNA DO THE

02:48:43.013 --> 02:48:45.882 region:rollup2
SPILLWAY ALONG WITH IT SO.

02:48:44.181 --> 02:48:49.086 region:rollup2

DOING OUTLETS.

02:49:00.097 --> 02:49:03.533 region:rollup2
OUTLETS ARE ANOTHER CONCERN

02:49:01.999 --> 02:49:06.303 region:rollup2
THAT WE NEED TO BE ADDRESSING ON

02:49:03.533 --> 02:49:08.038 region:rollup2

ARE GOOD AND WE GOT TO BE

02:49:08.572 --> 02:49:11.842 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT DRAINAGE SYSTEMS AND

02:49:10.073 --> 02:49:13.577 region:rollup2
DANCE BECAUSE THERE. THAT'S WHAT

02:49:11.842 --> 02:49:15.579 region:rollup2

THANK YOU NEED GOOD FILTERS.

02:49:18.148 --> 02:49:21.918 region:rollup2
SO IT ARE.

02:49:20.884 --> 02:49:22.886 region:rollup2
HAVE YOU TALKED MY ONLY THING IS

02:49:21.918 --> 02:49:24.154 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT WE HEARD

02:49:22.886 --> 02:49:25.489 region:rollup2
BEFORE WAS THAT PEOPLE JUST

02:49:24.154 --> 02:49:26.623 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT THE DAM THE STRUCTURE

02:49:25.489 --> 02:49:28.091 region:rollup2
FAILURE VERSUS ALL THE DIFFERENT

02:49:26.623 --> 02:49:29.659 region:rollup2
COMPONENTS THAT MAKE UP THE DAM

02:49:28.091 --> 02:49:31.194 region:rollup2
SYSTEM.

02:49:29.659 --> 02:49:32.863 region:rollup2
IF YOU WILL SO WHEN YOU'RE DOING

02:49:31.194 --> 02:49:34.831 region:rollup2
THESE NEW EVALUATIONS ARE YOU

02:49:32.863 --> 02:49:35.932 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT IT HOLISTICALLY AS A

02:49:34.831 --> 02:49:37.601 region:rollup2
DAM SYSTEM AND NOT JUST

02:49:35.932 --> 02:49:38.201 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS.

02:49:37.601 --> 02:49:40.003 region:rollup2
WE'RE ACTUALLY GONNA BE DOING

02:49:38.201 --> 02:49:42.105 region:rollup2
BOTH.

02:49:40.003 --> 02:49:43.874 region:rollup2
IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES LIKE

02:49:42.105 --> 02:49:45.242 region:rollup2
ON SPILLWAYS YOU REALLY GAIN

02:49:43.874 --> 02:49:47.811 region:rollup2
THAT EXPERTISE WHEN YOU'RE

02:49:45.242 --> 02:49:48.412 region:rollup2
FOCUSED AND AND AND YOU DIE DEEP

02:49:47.811 --> 02:49:49.946 region:rollup2
IN YOU LEARN EVERYTHING ABOUT

02:49:48.412 --> 02:49:52.349 region:rollup2
IT.

02:49:49.946 --> 02:49:53.817 region:rollup2
BUT WHAT THAT TYPICALLY OPENS UP

02:49:52.349 --> 02:49:55.318 region:rollup2
IS YOU'RE LOOKING AT MORE THAN

02:49:53.817 --> 02:49:56.520 region:rollup2
JUST THAT.

02:49:55.318 --> 02:49:58.655 region:rollup2
A LOT OF TIMES WITH THEIR DANCE

02:49:56.520 --> 02:50:01.024 region:rollup2
WHEN WE LOOK AT THE SIZE MAKE IT

02:49:58.655 --> 02:50:02.159 region:rollup2
AUTOMATICALLY MARKS IT YOU KNOW

02:50:01.024 --> 02:50:04.294 region:rollup2
IT'S LIKE WHEN YOU DO YOUR HOUSE

02:50:02.159 --> 02:50:06.963 region:rollup2
REMODEL IT IT IN MARCH BECAUSE

02:50:04.294 --> 02:50:08.498 region:rollup2
YOUNG COVER THIS NEW AND COVER

02:50:06.963 --> 02:50:09.433 region:rollup2
THAT. WELL OVER THERE YEAH.

02:50:08.498 --> 02:50:09.599 region:rollup2
AND THAT THAT'S HOW IT HAPPENS

02:50:09.433 --> 02:50:11.468 region:rollup2
BUT.

02:50:09.599 --> 02:50:13.670 region:rollup2
.

02:50:11.468 --> 02:50:15.672 region:rollup2
KNOWING THE.

02:50:13.670 --> 02:50:17.240 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW. KNOWING WHAT HAPPENED

02:50:15.672 --> 02:50:19.876 region:rollup2
OR AVAIL AND HOW SIGNIFICANT

02:50:17.240 --> 02:50:22.145 region:rollup2
THAT WAS AND IT WILL BE FOCUSED

02:50:19.876 --> 02:50:23.647 region:rollup2
ON SPILLWAYS BUT IT'S ALSO GOING

02:50:22.145 --> 02:50:27.984 region:rollup2
TO BE LOOKING AT.

02:50:23.647 --> 02:50:28.785 region:rollup2
COMPREHENSIVELY MORE THAN THAT.

02:50:27.984 --> 02:50:34.357 region:rollup2
IT'S GOING TO HAVE SOMETHING

02:50:28.785 --> 02:50:35.292 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC TO THIS PRESENTER.

02:50:34.357 --> 02:50:37.260 region:rollup2
OKAY I JUST HAVE A COUPLE MORE

02:50:35.292 --> 02:50:38.328 region:rollup2
SITES AND.

02:50:37.260 --> 02:50:40.730 region:rollup2
MEANING YOU GUYS HAVE ALREADY

02:50:38.328 --> 02:50:41.898 region:rollup2
STRESSED YOU GUYS KNOW THAT WE

02:50:40.730 --> 02:50:43.366 region:rollup2
HAVE THE AGING INFRASTRUCTURE

02:50:41.898 --> 02:50:44.701 region:rollup2
AND LACK OF INVESTMENT AND I

02:50:43.366 --> 02:50:46.636 region:rollup2
DON'T NEED TO GO THROUGH THAT.

02:50:44.701 --> 02:50:49.272 region:rollup2
AND BASICALLY THE COMMON THEMES

02:50:46.636 --> 02:50:51.541 region:rollup2
WE SEE IS A DAMNING REGULATOR.

02:50:49.272 --> 02:50:53.543 region:rollup2
THESE ARE TOP THREE IT'S IT'S

02:50:51.541 --> 02:50:55.412 region:rollup2
THAT FUNDING MECHANISMS.

02:50:53.543 --> 02:50:57.347 region:rollup2
DANNEMEYER OWNER SOME OF THEM

02:50:55.412 --> 02:50:59.816 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE A LOT OF OPTIONS FOR

02:50:57.347 --> 02:51:01.184 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT FUNDING MECHANISMS.

02:50:59.816 --> 02:51:03.453 region:rollup2
THAT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE.

02:51:01.184 --> 02:51:05.188 region:rollup2
EVEN THOUGH SOMEONE MAY HAVE A

02:51:03.453 --> 02:51:07.557 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW P. ELI SINCE.

02:51:05.188 --> 02:51:09.493 region:rollup2
THEY MAY NOT BE A SPECIALIST IN

02:51:07.557 --> 02:51:11.094 region:rollup2
DAM SAFETY AND THERE THERE ISN'T

02:51:09.493 --> 02:51:12.429 region:rollup2
A HUGE INDUSTRY OF DAM SAFETY

02:51:11.094 --> 02:51:13.964 region:rollup2
EXPERTS.

02:51:12.429 --> 02:51:15.866 region:rollup2
SO WE DO HAVE TO WORK VERY

02:51:13.964 --> 02:51:17.701 region:rollup2
CLOSELY WITH THE CONSULTANTS

02:51:15.866 --> 02:51:20.237 region:rollup2
THAT ARE DAM OWNERS CHOOSE.

02:51:17.701 --> 02:51:21.571 region:rollup2
AND AND AND BRING THEM ALONG AND

02:51:20.237 --> 02:51:23.206 region:rollup2
TO ENSURE THAT WE GET ADEQUATE

02:51:21.571 --> 02:51:24.541 region:rollup2
PLANS AND SPECS.

02:51:23.206 --> 02:51:25.375 region:rollup2
AND THEN LASTLY S THE

02:51:24.541 --> 02:51:28.712 region:rollup2
PERMITTING.

02:51:25.375 --> 02:51:31.114 region:rollup2
PERMITTING DOES. DOES TAKE TIME

02:51:28.712 --> 02:51:32.649 region:rollup2
AND DAM IS SO WHERE THAT IMPEDE

02:51:31.114 --> 02:51:34.851 region:rollup2
STAMMER NURSES THEY CAN'T GO OUT

02:51:32.649 --> 02:51:36.153 region:rollup2
AND QUICKLY DO A REPAIR IF IF

02:51:34.851 --> 02:51:37.387 region:rollup2
THEY SEE SOMETHING AND IF THEY

02:51:36.153 --> 02:51:39.089 region:rollup2
HAVE FUNDING AVAILABLE FOR THAT

02:51:37.387 --> 02:51:41.057 region:rollup2
YEAR IT REALLY HAS TO BE PLANNED

02:51:39.089 --> 02:51:43.226 region:rollup2
OUT IN ADVANCE.

02:51:41.057 --> 02:51:44.261 region:rollup2
AND THEN AGAIN ON THAT SIDE YOU

02:51:43.226 --> 02:51:46.062 region:rollup2
SEE ALL THE DIFFERENT TYPES

02:51:44.261 --> 02:51:47.664 region:rollup2
OWNERS SO AGAIN THEY EACH HAVE

02:51:46.062 --> 02:51:49.166 region:rollup2
THEIR OWN ABILITY AND KNOWING

02:51:47.664 --> 02:51:50.934 region:rollup2
HOW TO DO EACH OF THESE

02:51:49.166 --> 02:51:53.670 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT COMPONENTS.

02:51:50.934 --> 02:51:56.273 region:rollup2
AND THEN LASTLY ADVANCING DAM

02:51:53.670 --> 02:51:58.108 region:rollup2

02:59:19.649 --> 02:59:22.919 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATELY THERE'S A LOT OF

02:59:20.783 --> 02:59:25.054 region:rollup2
REASONS TO EVACUATE.

02:59:22.919 --> 02:59:26.055 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA WE

OKAY DEBT AND AS AS HAD OF DS SO

03:04:04.333 --> 03:04:06.469 region:rollup2
DE AND THEN AS THAT OF THE

03:04:05.902 --> 03:04:08.404 region:rollup2
INTEGRATED WATER MANAGEMENT

03:04:06.469 --> 03:04:10.273 region:rollup2
OKAY.

03:04:08.404 --> 03:04:11.607 region:rollup2
.

03:04:10.273 --> 03:04:13.676 region:rollup2
YOU MENTIONED THE FOURSOME GAVE

03:04:11.607 --> 03:04:16.312 region:rollup2
FAILURE. A MISSTEP VIA AND I

03:04:13.676 --> 03:04:18.814 region:rollup2
KNOW AND THAT HIGHLIGHTED THE A

03:04:16.312 --> 03:04:19.248 region:rollup2
THIS PROBLEMS WITH ANCHOR TENANT

03:04:18.814 --> 03:04:21.150 region:rollup2
RODS THAT ARE AGED.

03:04:19.248 --> 03:04:23.719 region:rollup2
.

03:04:21.150 --> 03:04:26.389 region:rollup2
WHAT'S THE STATUS OF WAR BILLS.

03:04:23.719 --> 03:04:29.058 region:rollup2
ACRE TEN IN RAZA KNOW THAT WAS

03:04:26.389 --> 03:04:31.227 region:rollup2
THERE SIMILAR AGE AS FULSOME.

03:04:29.058 --> 03:04:31.827 region:rollup2
AND HAVE WE REPLACE THOSE YET

03:04:31.227 --> 03:04:34.430 region:rollup2
WHAT IS THE STATUS OF THOSE.

03:04:31.827 --> 03:04:35.898 region:rollup2
AND.

03:04:34.430 --> 03:04:36.332 region:rollup2
SO WITH WITH FULL SUMGAIT THE

03:04:35.898 --> 03:04:38.200 region:rollup2
ACTUAL.

03:04:36.332 --> 03:04:39.969 region:rollup2
FAILURE MECHANISM WAS ACTUALLY

03:04:38.200 --> 03:04:41.804 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT WAS NOT KNOWN AT

03:04:39.969 --> 03:04:43.606 region:rollup2
THE TIME INDUSTRY AND THAT WAS.

03:04:41.804 --> 03:04:44.607 region:rollup2
THE TRUNNION FRICTION.

03:04:43.606 --> 03:04:46.375 region:rollup2
SO IT'S ACTUALLY WHERE THE GATE

03:04:44.607 --> 03:04:48.444 region:rollup2
ROTATES AND THAT FRICTION

03:04:46.375 --> 03:04:48.911 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THAT THE TRUNNION

03:04:48.444 --> 03:04:50.780 region:rollup2
PENS WEREN'T PROPERLY

03:04:48.911 --> 03:04:52.281 region:rollup2
MAINTAINED.

03:04:50.780 --> 03:04:53.849 region:rollup2
THE FRICTION GOT TOO HIGH IN

03:04:52.281 --> 03:04:56.552 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHAT CAUSED THE GATE TO

03:04:53.849 --> 03:04:58.020 region:rollup2
BUYING DE. UM AND THEN WHEN IT

03:04:56.552 --> 03:04:59.689 region:rollup2
FINDS THAT THEN IT EFFECTS THE

03:04:58.020 --> 03:05:02.892 region:rollup2
TENDONS BUT TENANTS ARE IN AN

03:04:59.689 --> 03:05:03.392 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY ISSUE. BECAUSE THERE

03:05:02.892 --> 03:05:04.794 region:rollup2
EMBEDDED INTO CONCRETE.

03:05:03.392 --> 03:05:05.728 region:rollup2
AND.

03:05:04.794 --> 03:05:06.896 region:rollup2
AND THEY'RE THEY'RE VERY

03:05:05.728 --> 03:05:08.798 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT TO RETROFIT.

03:05:06.896 --> 03:05:10.666 region:rollup2
AND SO I KNOW THE ONES THAT

03:05:08.798 --> 03:05:12.935 region:rollup2
OROVILLE ARE BEING EVALUATED.

03:05:10.666 --> 03:05:13.502 region:rollup2
NOT TOO LONG AGO I. THINK

03:05:12.935 --> 03:05:15.371 region:rollup2
JUST A MONTH OR TWO AGO THAT

03:05:13.502 --> 03:05:17.440 region:rollup2
AND.

03:05:15.371 --> 03:05:19.108 region:rollup2
D. W. R. HAD A WORKSHOP ON IT

03:05:17.440 --> 03:05:21.243 region:rollup2
AND I HAD SOME OF OUR STRUCTURAL

03:05:19.108 --> 03:05:22.511 region:rollup2
EXPERTS IN OUR DIVISION ATTENDED

03:05:21.243 --> 03:05:24.080 region:rollup2
SO WE'RE FOLLOWING ALONG WITH D.

03:05:22.511 --> 03:05:24.714 region:rollup2
W. ARE. WHAT THEY'RE DOING WITH

IT?

03:05:24.714 --> 03:05:26.649 region:rollup2
I DON'T THINK THERE'S A

03:05:25.214 --> 03:05:29.151 region:rollup2
DEFINITE PLAN YET THEY'RE STILL

03:05:26.649 --> 03:05:30.753 region:rollup2
UNDER INVESTIGATION. BUT OF

03:05:29.151 --> 03:05:32.121 region:rollup2
REPLACING TENDONS.

03:05:30.753 --> 03:05:33.489 region:rollup2
I THINK YOU'LL YOU'LL SEE.

03:05:32.121 --> 03:05:35.124 region:rollup2
MAYBE PROBABLY WHATEVER COMES

03:05:33.489 --> 03:05:37.059 region:rollup2
OUT OF D. W. ARE. COULD LEAD THE

03:05:35.124 --> 03:05:39.895 region:rollup2
NATION AND AND IN THE TECHNOLOGY

03:05:37.059 --> 03:05:41.330 region:rollup2

MAYBE THEY NEED REPLACEMENT

03:10:20.709 --> 03:10:24.980 region:rollup2

WELL.

03:11:21.003 --> 03:11:26.542 region:rollup2
CURRENT SOMETHING TO CONSIDER

03:11:22.671 --> 03:11:28.077 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK THAT.

03:11:26.542 --> 03:11:30.279 region:rollup2
THE DIALOGUE WE HAVE BEEN HAVING

03:11:28.077 --> 03:11:32.348 region:rollup2
IN THE STRUCTURING HAVE IT UNDER

03:11:30.279 --> 03:11:34.783 region:rollup2
WORKS I MEAN I THINK A PART OF

03:11:32.348 --> 03:11:37.219 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO WE HAVE REGULARLY.

03:11:34.783 --> 03:11:39.655 region:rollup2
SCHEDULED MEETINGS IN WHICH WE.

03:11:37.219 --> 03:11:41.156 region:rollup2
TALK WITH THE CONTRACTORS IN

03:11:39.655 --> 03:11:43.459 region:rollup2
PART IS THEY NEED TO PLAN FOR

03:11:41.156 --> 03:11:45.427 region:rollup2
UPCOMING EXPENSES AND BILLS AND

03:11:43.459 --> 03:11:46.795 region:rollup2
CHANGES IN THE BILL SO.

03:11:45.427 --> 03:11:48.897 region:rollup2
THAT NECESSITATES THE NEED TO

03:11:46.795 --> 03:11:50.466 region:rollup2
REALLY.

03:11:48.897 --> 03:11:53.535 region:rollup2
BRING THEM ALONG IN THESE

03:11:50.466 --> 03:11:54.770 region:rollup2
PLANNING. EFFORTS AND AS WE KNOW

03:11:53.535 --> 03:11:56.939 region:rollup2
BIGGER EXPENSES ARE COMING DOWN

03:11:54.770 --> 03:11:57.806 region:rollup2
THE LINE WE NEED IT WE'RE TRYING

03:11:56.939 --> 03:12:01.010 region:rollup2
TO PROVIDE THEM TIME TO.

03:11:57.806 --> 03:12:02.478 region:rollup2
.

03:12:01.010 --> 03:12:04.146 region:rollup2
I JUST THEIR BUDGETS AND AND

03:12:02.478 --> 03:12:05.080 region:rollup2
WHAT NOT TO A ADDRESS A BILLS

03:12:04.146 --> 03:12:11.920 region:rollup2
WHEN THEY COME AND.

03:12:05.080 --> 03:12:12.988 region:rollup2
SO.

03:12:11.920 --> 03:12:14.089 region:rollup2
IN IT WE KNOW THERE'S A LOT I

03:12:12.988 --> 03:12:15.791 region:rollup2
NEED AROUND THE STATE AND WE'RE

03:12:14.089 --> 03:12:16.725 region:rollup2
STARTING TO GET A LOT MORE

03:12:15.791 --> 03:12:18.761 region:rollup2
INFORMATION ON THAT AND I THINK

03:12:16.725 --> 03:12:20.629 region:rollup2
THAT I MEAN THAT WAS AN ISSUE

03:12:18.761 --> 03:12:21.630 region:rollup2
THAT I REACHED ON. ON NOW THE

03:12:20.629 --> 03:12:23.132 region:rollup2
OROVILLE TOUR AS WELL.

03:12:21.630 --> 03:12:24.566 region:rollup2
HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT THE

03:12:23.132 --> 03:12:26.335 region:rollup2
BENEFICIARIES ARE PAYING FOR THE

03:12:24.566 --> 03:12:27.336 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE UPDATE

03:12:26.335 --> 03:12:29.138 region:rollup2
AND EVERYTHING AS WE'RE GOING

03:12:27.336 --> 03:12:29.738 region:rollup2
FORWARD?

03:12:29.138 --> 03:12:31.774 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING

03:12:29.738 --> 03:12:33.008 region:rollup2
THAT WE STILL.

03:12:31.774 --> 03:12:33.876 region:rollup2
MOVE NEED TO PUT HAVE A LOT OF

03:12:33.008 --> 03:12:34.943 region:rollup2
ATTENTION ON NOW I UNDERSTAND

03:12:33.876 --> 03:12:37.246 region:rollup2
IT'S GONNA BE A NEW ABILITY TO

03:12:34.943 --> 03:12:39.848 region:rollup2
FINE OWNERS A THOUSAND DOLLARS A

03:12:37.246 --> 03:12:40.449 region:rollup2
DAY YOU'RE HOPING IF THAT'S ALSO

03:12:39.848 --> 03:12:40.883 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE IN A MECHANISM TO

03:12:40.449 --> 03:12:43.152 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE.

03:12:40.883 --> 03:12:45.120 region:rollup2
THAT PEOPLE ACTUALLY.

03:12:43.152 --> 03:12:46.555 region:rollup2
AGAIN THE IT IN PARTICULAR THE

03:12:45.120 --> 03:12:48.557 region:rollup2
DAMS THAT THEY HAVE IN ORDER SO

03:12:46.555 --> 03:12:49.658 region:rollup2
THEY CAN MEET SAFE USED.

03:12:48.557 --> 03:12:52.027 region:rollup2
YEAH AND YOU KNOW I THINK

03:12:49.658 --> 03:12:53.128 region:rollup2
THAT'LL WORK MOST EFFECTIVELY

03:12:52.027 --> 03:12:53.395 region:rollup2
WITH THE OWNERS WHO ARE NON

03:12:53.128 --> 03:12:55.364 region:rollup2
COMPLIANT.

03:12:53.395 --> 03:12:56.865 region:rollup2
.

03:12:55.364 --> 03:12:57.1000 region:rollup2
THE ONES THAT AREN'T ABLE TO DO

03:12:56.865 --> 03:12:59.768 region:rollup2
IT BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE. THE

03:12:57.1000 --> 03:13:01.570 region:rollup2
RESOURCES.

03:12:59.768 --> 03:13:02.871 region:rollup2
IT'S LIKE YOU KNOW HOW EFFECTIVE

03:13:01.570 --> 03:13:04.039 region:rollup2
IS THAT REALLY GOING TO BE.

03:13:02.871 --> 03:13:05.641 region:rollup2
TOUGH BYNUM AND THAT'S WHERE

03:13:04.039 --> 03:13:07.876 region:rollup2
THE RESERVOIR RESTRICTIONS COME

03:13:05.641 --> 03:13:09.545 region:rollup2
AND IT'S MORE THE PHYSICAL STUFF

TEAM IDENTIFIED EARLY ON.

03:18:06.808 --> 03:18:10.178 region:rollup2
WE ADDRESS THOSE

03:18:08.610 --> 03:18:12.381 region:rollup2
IN THE DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION

03:18:10.178 --> 03:18:15.016 region:rollup2
OF THE MAIN SPILLWAY SO.

03:18:12.381 --> 03:18:15.650 region:rollup2
THAT WAS AN IMMEDIATE CHANGE.

03:18:15.016 --> 03:18:16.952 region:rollup2

IN INCOME AND CONSTRUCTION HANCE

03:18:23.291 --> 03:18:25.160 region:rollup2
MINTS.

03:18:23.492 --> 03:18:28.430 region:rollup2
.

03:18:25.160 --> 03:18:30.599 region:rollup2
WE WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE.

03:18:28.430 --> 03:18:32.400 region:rollup2
M.. ERIC AYE I WILL JUST POINT

PURVIEW I KNOW DS SO DE THERE IS

03:18:50.786 --> 03:18:54.156 region:rollup2
ALWAYS A FIREWALL BUT THAT WE

03:18:52.454 --> 03:18:56.324 region:rollup2
NEED TO MAINTAIN. BUT I THINK

03:18:54.156 --> 03:18:57.993 region:rollup2
JUST IN TERMS OF COMMUNICATIONS

03:18:56.324 --> 03:18:59.194 region:rollup2
REPORTING WERE JUST TALKING

03:18:57.993 --> 03:19:00.862 region:rollup2
ABOUT HOW.

03:18:59.194 --> 03:19:02.364 region:rollup2
HOW WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO

03:19:00.862 --> 03:19:04.366 region:rollup2
THINGS DIFFERENTLY TO KIND OF

03:19:02.364 --> 03:19:05.801 region:rollup2
HAVE SOME TRANSPARENCY IF YOU

03:19:04.366 --> 03:19:07.435 region:rollup2
WILL I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE

03:19:05.801 --> 03:19:08.970 region:rollup2
THEM? THEMES WE'VE HEARD OVER

03:19:07.435 --> 03:19:11.106 region:rollup2
THE LAST.

03:19:08.970 --> 03:19:11.940 region:rollup2
NO SINCE LAST FEBRUARY IS IS HOW

03:19:11.106 --> 03:19:13.975 region:rollup2
CAN THE DEPARTMENT BE MORE

03:19:11.940 --> 03:19:15.710 region:rollup2
TRANSPARENT AND WHAT WE'RE DOING

03:19:13.975 --> 03:19:18.380 region:rollup2
IN CHANGES WERE MAKING. SO NOT

03:19:15.710 --> 03:19:19.681 region:rollup2
WANT.

03:19:18.380 --> 03:19:20.882 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOT DONE THERE'S A LOT

03:19:19.681 --> 03:19:21.850 region:rollup2
MORE TO COME I THINK

03:19:20.882 --> 03:19:23.885 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FRIENDS

03:19:21.850 --> 03:19:25.453 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN REPORT WILL BE AND NEXT

03:19:23.885 --> 03:19:27.856 region:rollup2
BIG STEP FOR US.

03:19:25.453 --> 03:19:29.558 region:rollup2
WE HAVE SOME STRIKE TEAMS WE

03:19:27.856 --> 03:19:31.827 region:rollup2
PUT TOGETHER INTERNALLY TO DEAL

03:19:29.558 --> 03:19:33.895 region:rollup2
WITH DIFFERENT SPECIFIC ELEMENTS

03:19:31.827 --> 03:19:35.664 region:rollup2
AROUND THE OROVILLE. FACILITY

03:19:33.895 --> 03:19:36.131 region:rollup2
WHETHER IT'S THE SPILLWAY

03:19:35.664 --> 03:19:37.098 region:rollup2
WHETHER AT SOME OF THE

03:19:36.131 --> 03:19:39.034 region:rollup2
RECREATIONAL.

03:19:37.098 --> 03:19:40.769 region:rollup2
EARLY IMPLEMENTATION ACTION SO

03:19:39.034 --> 03:19:42.103 region:rollup2
WERE WERE FOR IDENTIFYING PEOPLE

03:19:40.769 --> 03:19:43.004 region:rollup2
IN PULLING THOSE TEAMS TOGETHER

03:19:42.103 --> 03:19:44.372 region:rollup2
TO MOVE A LITTLE BIT MORE

03:19:43.004 --> 03:19:47.142 region:rollup2
EFFICIENTLY AND QUICKLY ON SOME

03:19:44.372 --> 03:19:48.810 region:rollup2
OF THESE ELEMENTS.

03:19:47.142 --> 03:19:50.045 region:rollup2
AND THERE MIGHT BE MORE BUT I

03:19:48.810 --> 03:19:50.946 region:rollup2
WAS OF THE ONES THAT. ARE

03:19:50.045 --> 03:19:53.982 region:rollup2
POPPING UP IN MY HEAD RIGHT AT

03:19:50.946 --> 03:19:56.318 region:rollup2
THE MOMENT.

03:19:53.982 --> 03:19:57.953 region:rollup2
THINK YOU'RE A MUCH.

03:19:56.318 --> 03:19:59.654 region:rollup2
AND THINK TO THIS PANEL IT'S

03:19:57.953 --> 03:20:00.622 region:rollup2
ALSO BEEN VERY INFORMATIVE AND

03:19:59.654 --> 03:20:02.524 region:rollup2
WE APPRECIATE IT.

03:20:00.622 --> 03:20:04.459 region:rollup2
AND NOW WE'RE GONNA HAVE PUBLIC

03:20:02.524 --> 03:20:05.160 region:rollup2
COMMENTS SO PEOPLE ONE OF HAVE

03:20:04.459 --> 03:20:07.329 region:rollup2
SOMETHING TO SAY ONE LINE UP ON

03:20:05.160 --> 03:20:08.697 region:rollup2
THE SIDE OVER HERE AND THEN TAKE

03:20:07.329 --> 03:20:22.911 region:rollup2
NOT MORE THAN TWO MINUTES TO

03:20:08.697 --> 03:20:24.379 region:rollup2
EXPRESS YOURSELF.

03:20:22.911 --> 03:20:26.014 region:rollup2
RON STRUCK FRANCE OF THE RIVER.

03:20:24.379 --> 03:20:27.482 region:rollup2
WE WERE ONE OF THE OUTSIDE

03:20:26.014 --> 03:20:28.750 region:rollup2
GROUPS THAT I RAISE THE. ISSUE

03:20:27.482 --> 03:20:31.152 region:rollup2
OF.

03:20:28.750 --> 03:20:33.121 region:rollup2
OF THEM.

03:20:31.152 --> 03:20:33.989 region:rollup2
G. LOGICAL TO POLLUTE STABILITY

03:20:33.121 --> 03:20:36.758 region:rollup2
OF THE WHOLE SIDE.

03:20:33.989 --> 03:20:38.827 region:rollup2
.

03:20:36.758 --> 03:20:41.096 region:rollup2
CLEARLY THIS THIS HAD BEEN A

03:20:38.827 --> 03:20:42.597 region:rollup2
VERY INFORMATIVE HEARING.

03:20:41.096 --> 03:20:43.498 region:rollup2
BOTH A MACHETE YOU AS WELL AS

03:20:42.597 --> 03:20:45.033 region:rollup2
TO MEMBERS OF THE AUDIENCE.

03:20:43.498 --> 03:20:47.235 region:rollup2
.

03:20:45.033 --> 03:20:48.303 region:rollup2
IT ALSO I THINK HIGHLIGHTS THE

03:20:47.235 --> 03:20:50.739 region:rollup2
INCREDIBLE.

03:20:48.303 --> 03:20:53.341 region:rollup2
.

03:20:50.739 --> 03:20:55.076 region:rollup2
TRUST THAT WE HAVE TO PLACE.

03:20:53.341 --> 03:20:57.312 region:rollup2
OR THAT WE WE. WE'RE WE'RE

03:20:55.076 --> 03:20:59.514 region:rollup2
FORCED PLACE IN THAT APARTMENT

03:20:57.312 --> 03:21:01.750 region:rollup2
AND THE DAM SAFETY REGULATORS.

03:20:59.514 --> 03:21:03.285 region:rollup2
.

03:21:01.750 --> 03:21:05.020 region:rollup2
BUT EXAMPLE.

03:21:03.285 --> 03:21:06.922 region:rollup2
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I'VE

03:21:05.020 --> 03:21:08.156 region:rollup2
HEARD.

03:21:06.922 --> 03:21:10.559 region:rollup2
THE CONCERNED.

03:21:08.156 --> 03:21:11.893 region:rollup2
IN DURING THE INCIDENT

03:21:10.559 --> 03:21:13.762 region:rollup2
THAT IF THERE WAS A FAILURE OF

03:21:11.893 --> 03:21:16.131 region:rollup2
THE.

03:21:13.762 --> 03:21:20.435 region:rollup2
ELECTRICAL POWER STANDARD

03:21:16.131 --> 03:21:21.937 region:rollup2
ELECTRICAL POWER TO THE. US OF

03:21:20.435 --> 03:21:23.805 region:rollup2
FLOOD CONTROL ADVOCATES. THAT IT

03:21:21.937 --> 03:21:25.473 region:rollup2
WILL TAKE SEVERAL DAYS TO SOME

03:21:23.805 --> 03:21:26.608 region:rollup2
ANOTHER GET BACK CONTROL OF THE

03:21:25.473 --> 03:21:26.775 region:rollup2
KATE'S.

03:21:26.608 --> 03:21:28.910 region:rollup2
THE.

03:21:26.775 --> 03:21:31.146 region:rollup2
.

03:21:28.910 --> 03:21:33.682 region:rollup2
ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS MANUAL

03:21:31.146 --> 03:21:35.483 region:rollup2
CLEARLY STATES FOR OROVILLE

03:21:33.682 --> 03:21:38.887 region:rollup2
CLEARLY STATES THAT THERE'S.

03:21:35.483 --> 03:21:41.957 region:rollup2
BACKUP POWER INDEPENDENT POWER.

03:21:38.887 --> 03:21:43.091 region:rollup2
AT THE DAM THAT IS FULLY CAPABLE

03:21:41.957 --> 03:21:45.660 region:rollup2
OF OPERATING THE GATES.

03:21:43.091 --> 03:21:47.629 region:rollup2
.

03:21:45.660 --> 03:21:49.831 region:rollup2
I SO I ASSUME THAT WAS IN INDEED

03:21:47.629 --> 03:21:51.866 region:rollup2
IN PLACE I'M SURPRISED HERE

03:21:49.831 --> 03:21:53.868 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT THE CASE.

03:21:51.866 --> 03:21:55.670 region:rollup2
OR PERHAPS IT WAS A MISSTATEMENT

03:21:53.868 --> 03:21:58.073 region:rollup2
BUT THE THE ISSUE.

03:21:55.670 --> 03:22:01.176 region:rollup2
FOR THE COMMITTEE AND FOR US.

03:21:58.073 --> 03:22:04.813 region:rollup2
AND FOR THE DEPARTMENT IS.

03:22:01.176 --> 03:22:06.414 region:rollup2
THAT THAT'S CRITICAL ENERGY.

03:22:04.813 --> 03:22:07.682 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE INFORMATION

03:22:06.414 --> 03:22:09.117 region:rollup2
THAT'S REALLY NOT AVAILABLE TO

03:22:07.682 --> 03:22:11.152 region:rollup2
THE PUBLIC THE DEPARTMENT

03:22:09.117 --> 03:22:13.121 region:rollup2
PROBABLY WOULDN'T FEEL.

03:22:11.152 --> 03:22:15.290 region:rollup2
THAT HE COULD DISCUSS.

03:22:13.121 --> 03:22:18.360 region:rollup2
ANY DEFICIENCIES THAT IT MIGHT

03:22:15.290 --> 03:22:20.629 region:rollup2
HAVE IN EMPOWER INDEPENDENT

03:22:18.360 --> 03:22:25.033 region:rollup2
POWER RELIABLE POWER TO THE

03:22:20.629 --> 03:22:26.234 region:rollup2
FLOOD CONTROL OUTLETS. AND SO.

03:22:25.033 --> 03:22:27.068 region:rollup2
AND WE WE IN EFFECT HAVE TO

03:22:26.234 --> 03:22:29.304 region:rollup2
TRUST THE DEPARTMENT.

03:22:27.068 --> 03:22:30.839 region:rollup2
AND.

03:22:29.304 --> 03:22:32.640 region:rollup2
THE FEDERAL REGULATORS.

03:22:30.839 --> 03:22:36.077 region:rollup2
THAT.

03:22:32.640 --> 03:22:37.946 region:rollup2
THAT INDEED IS NOT A PROBLEM.

03:22:36.077 --> 03:22:40.081 region:rollup2
AND WE ALSO HEAR THAT WEALTH OF

03:22:37.946 --> 03:22:41.916 region:rollup2
THE EMPHASIS HAS BEEN ON.

03:22:40.081 --> 03:22:43.618 region:rollup2
.

03:22:41.916 --> 03:22:44.219 region:rollup2
A DEALING WITH ISSUES THAT FAIL

03:22:43.618 --> 03:22:46.821 region:rollup2
THE DAM.

03:22:44.219 --> 03:22:48.423 region:rollup2
.

03:22:46.821 --> 03:22:50.558 region:rollup2
NOT HAVING POWER TO THE FLOOD

03:22:48.423 --> 03:22:52.560 region:rollup2
CONTROL OUTLETS IS A VERY

03:22:50.558 --> 03:22:54.896 region:rollup2
SERIOUS DEFICIENCY. AND LET IT

03:22:52.560 --> 03:22:57.699 region:rollup2
VERY WELL MAY NOT FEEL THE DAM.

03:22:54.896 --> 03:22:58.433 region:rollup2
LEAST IF THE EMERGENCY SPILLWAY.

03:22:57.699 --> 03:22:59.401 region:rollup2
DOESN'T FAIL.

03:22:58.433 --> 03:23:01.236 region:rollup2
.

03:22:59.401 --> 03:23:03.905 region:rollup2
SO.

03:23:01.236 --> 03:23:05.273 region:rollup2
SO I DON'T KNOW IF

03:23:03.905 --> 03:23:06.508 region:rollup2
I'M FULLY CONFIDENT OR THE

03:23:05.273 --> 03:23:07.575 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENTS FULLY CONFIDENT

03:23:06.508 --> 03:23:09.210 region:rollup2
WHERE YOU AND YOUR OVERSIGHT

03:23:07.575 --> 03:23:11.613 region:rollup2
ROLE.

03:23:09.210 --> 03:23:13.415 region:rollup2
IS FULLY CONFIDENT THAT.

03:23:11.613 --> 03:23:15.016 region:rollup2
THE DEPARTMENT AND THE

03:23:13.415 --> 03:23:18.253 region:rollup2
REGULATORS REALLY HAFTA.

03:23:15.016 --> 03:23:18.653 region:rollup2
FIRM HAND ON THIS.

03:23:18.253 --> 03:23:20.655 region:rollup2
THE.

03:23:18.653 --> 03:23:21.222 region:rollup2
THE SECOND POINT I WOULD JUST

03:23:20.655 --> 03:23:23.625 region:rollup2
RAISE.

03:23:21.222 --> 03:23:24.159 region:rollup2
WHICH IS A POINT I ALWAYS RAISE.

03:23:23.625 --> 03:23:25.994 region:rollup2
IS.

03:23:24.159 --> 03:23:26.895 region:rollup2
IT'S GOOD TO HEAR THAT THE

03:23:25.994 --> 03:23:28.730 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT IS CONSIDERING.

03:23:26.895 --> 03:23:30.932 region:rollup2
.

03:23:28.730 --> 03:23:33.368 region:rollup2
ON EMERGENCY SPILLWAY THAT

03:23:30.932 --> 03:23:33.902 region:rollup2
WON'T THROW LARGE QUANTITIES OF.

03:23:33.368 --> 03:23:36.404 region:rollup2
A HILLSIDE INTO THE CANYON

03:23:33.902 --> 03:23:38.506 region:rollup2
BELOW.

03:23:36.404 --> 03:23:40.141 region:rollup2
BUT AT LEAST AT THIS POINT I

03:23:38.506 --> 03:23:41.209 region:rollup2
THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY. THE

03:23:40.141 --> 03:23:42.577 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT HAS NO PLANS TO DO

03:23:41.209 --> 03:23:45.046 region:rollup2
THAT.

03:23:42.577 --> 03:23:47.916 region:rollup2
SO SOME OF THE DEFICIENCIES

03:23:45.046 --> 03:23:51.286 region:rollup2
THAT YOU SAW SOME OF THE CHAOS.

03:23:47.916 --> 03:23:51.486 region:rollup2
THAT WAS ASSOCIATED WITH.

03:23:51.286 --> 03:23:54.722 region:rollup2
THE.

03:23:51.486 --> 03:23:56.357 region:rollup2
INCIDENT HAS YET TO BE.

03:23:54.722 --> 03:23:58.193 region:rollup2
FULLY ADDRESSED

03:23:56.357 --> 03:24:00.562 region:rollup2
AND.

03:23:58.193 --> 03:24:02.330 region:rollup2
AND I HOPE THE DEPARTMENT DOES

03:24:00.562 --> 03:24:04.432 region:rollup2
AND HOPE THE REGULATORS.

03:24:02.330 --> 03:24:05.233 region:rollup2
ADDRESS THAT.

03:24:04.432 --> 03:24:08.503 region:rollup2
BUT.

03:24:05.233 --> 03:24:10.004 region:rollup2
FOR AS AN OUTSIDE GROUP OR JUST

03:24:08.503 --> 03:24:11.940 region:rollup2
AS A MEMBER OF THE INTERESTED

03:24:10.004 --> 03:24:13.742 region:rollup2
PUBLIC IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR

03:24:11.940 --> 03:24:15.577 region:rollup2
US TO ENGAGE.

03:24:13.742 --> 03:24:17.612 region:rollup2
WE'VE HAD FOR.

03:24:15.577 --> 03:24:18.379 region:rollup2
FORMAL COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE

03:24:17.612 --> 03:24:20.882 region:rollup2
FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY

03:24:18.379 --> 03:24:23.017 region:rollup2
COMMISSION SINCE THE INCIDENT.

03:24:20.882 --> 03:24:23.885 region:rollup2
AND THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE

03:24:23.017 --> 03:24:25.153 region:rollup2
CHARGED WITH MAKING SURE THAT

03:24:23.885 --> 03:24:27.055 region:rollup2
THE FACILITIES ARE ADEQUATE TO

03:24:25.153 --> 03:24:28.523 region:rollup2
HIS.

03:24:27.055 --> 03:24:30.024 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW OF SUSTAIN THE

03:24:28.523 --> 03:24:32.260 region:rollup2
FUNCTIONS THE MISSION OF THE

03:24:30.024 --> 03:24:33.394 region:rollup2
PROJECT. AND WE'VE YET TO HEAR

03:24:32.260 --> 03:24:35.130 region:rollup2
ANYTHING BACK FROM THE

03:24:33.394 --> 03:24:38.666 region:rollup2
COMMISSION.

03:24:35.130 --> 03:24:43.104 region:rollup2
SO. I HAVE WARY NOW.

03:24:38.666 --> 03:24:44.706 region:rollup2
QUIT. YOUR ROLE AS A AS A AS A.

03:24:43.104 --> 03:24:46.875 region:rollup2

MANDY BE ERY IMPORTANT SOME OF

03:24:46.875 --> 03:24:50.178 region:rollup2
THESE ISSUES.

03:24:48.576 --> 03:24:52.881 region:rollup2
AND. IT WOULD NEED TO BE

03:24:50.178 --> 03:24:54.582 region:rollup2
ADDRESSED SUCCESSFULLY AND IN A

03:24:52.881 --> 03:24:56.451 region:rollup2
WAY THAT INVOLVES.

03:24:54.582 --> 03:24:58.586 region:rollup2
MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC SO THAT WE

03:24:56.451 --> 03:24:59.254 region:rollup2
CAN TRUST THAT.

03:24:58.586 --> 03:25:01.890 region:rollup2
ON THE DEPARTMENT OF THE

03:24:59.254 --> 03:25:03.892 region:rollup2
REGULATORS ARE DOING THEIR JOB.

03:25:01.890 --> 03:25:04.592 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S KIND OF MY MY REMARKS

03:25:03.892 --> 03:25:05.927 region:rollup2
FOR THINK IT'S PREMATURE

03:26:24.072 --> 03:26:26.941 region:rollup2
WHEN THE OROVILLE DAM WAS BUILT

03:26:25.373 --> 03:26:28.443 region:rollup2
IT WAS PART OF ONE OF MANY

03:26:26.941 --> 03:26:30.111 region:rollup2

03:26:33.581 --> 03:26:36.417 region:rollup2
SO THAT THE WATER THAT WATER

THOUSAND ACRE FEET OF WATER.

03:27:37.812 --> 03:27:40.348 region:rollup2
THAT SCHEME THAT THEY CAME UP

COULDN'T FIND ALONG WITH.

03:27:54.896 --> 03:27:58.1000 region:rollup2
BORE HOLE DRILLING WAS THEIR OWN

03:27:56.698 --> 03:28:00.201 region:rollup2
OPERATIONAL MANUAL THAT REQUIRED

03:27:58.1000 --> 03:28:01.636 region:rollup2
THEM TO LOOK RELEASED TEN TO

SPILLWAY.

03:28:04.639 --> 03:28:07.775 region:rollup2
WHICH EVERYBODY SAYS THEY NEVER

03:28:05.640 --> 03:28:09.410 region:rollup2
WANTED TO USE.

03:28:07.775 --> 03:28:10.878 region:rollup2
THEIR OWN OPERATION MANUAL WAS

03:28:09.410 --> 03:28:12.780 region:rollup2
COMPROMISE IN DOING SO THEY

03:28:10.878 --> 03:28:14.182 region:rollup2
COMPROMISED.

03:28:12.780 --> 03:28:16.584 region:rollup2
TWENTY PERCENT OF THE FLOOD

03:28:14.182 --> 03:28:18.119 region:rollup2
STORAGE SPACE ON THAT RIVER.

03:28:16.584 --> 03:28:19.387 region:rollup2
TWENTY PERCENT WOULD HAVE KEPT

03:28:18.119 --> 03:28:21.222 region:rollup2
THE WATER FROM REACHING THE TOP

03:28:19.387 --> 03:28:22.990 region:rollup2
THE LEVEES BACK IN EIGHTY SIX

03:28:21.222 --> 03:28:24.392 region:rollup2
AND NINETY SEVEN. WE WOULD HAVE

03:28:22.990 --> 03:28:26.361 region:rollup2
HAD THAT THE LEVEE SLUMPING WE

03:28:24.392 --> 03:28:27.495 region:rollup2
WOULD HAVE HAD.

03:28:26.361 --> 03:28:28.796 region:rollup2
THE STATE PAYING OUT FOUR

03:28:27.495 --> 03:28:30.431 region:rollup2

DOLLARS IN DAMAGES IN NINETY

03:28:30.431 --> 03:28:34.002 region:rollup2
SEVEN.

03:28:32.333 --> 03:28:35.069 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY COMPROMISED FLOOD

03:28:34.002 --> 03:28:40.908 region:rollup2
PROTECTION FOR THE SAKE OF WATER

03:28:35.069 --> 03:28:42.710 region:rollup2
DELIVERIES.

03:28:40.908 --> 03:28:44.812 region:rollup2
I FIND IT.

03:28:42.710 --> 03:28:46.881 region:rollup2
IRONIC THAT AT THIS MOMENT THAT

03:28:44.812 --> 03:28:47.982 region:rollup2
YOUR BILL DAM HAPPEN BOTH THOSE

03:28:46.881 --> 03:28:49.684 region:rollup2
SETS OF REGULATIONS ARE BEFORE

CONTRACTORS.

03:28:57.859 --> 03:29:02.030 region:rollup2
HIDDEN IN THAT IS. NOT ONLY DO

03:29:00.795 --> 03:29:03.765 region:rollup2
THEY WANT TO MAINTAIN A FOUR

03:29:02.030 --> 03:29:04.999 region:rollup2
POINT TWO MILLION ACRE FEET OF

03:29:03.765 --> 03:29:06.501 region:rollup2

03:29:04.999 --> 03:29:07.802 region:rollup2
UNDELIVERABLE.

03:29:06.501 --> 03:29:09.470 region:rollup2
BUT THEY ALSO WANT TO SET UP

03:29:07.802 --> 03:29:10.438 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL COMMITTEE.

03:29:09.470 --> 03:29:13.007 region:rollup2
THAT GIVES STATE WATER

BUDGETING SHOULD BE DONE.

03:29:17.879 --> 03:29:21.649 region:rollup2
AND NO WHERE IN THAT.

03:29:19.881 --> 03:29:23.017 region:rollup2

GOING TO BE COMING OUT SHORTLY.

03:29:28.056 --> 03:29:32.360 region:rollup2
IS THERE ANY PUBLIC RECORD

03:29:29.357 --> 03:29:33.694 region:rollup2
CETACEAN ANY PUBLIC TRANSPARENCY

03:29:32.360 --> 03:29:36.130 region:rollup2
OF THE BUDGETING THAT GOES

03:29:33.694 --> 03:29:38.633 region:rollup2
TOWARDS PUBLIC SAFETY THAT THEY

03:29:36.130 --> 03:29:39.700 region:rollup2
SAY IS OUR NUMBER ONE PRIORITY.

03:29:38.633 --> 03:29:41.469 region:rollup2
I THINK THIS COMMITTEE SHOULD DO

03:29:39.700 --> 03:29:42.570 region:rollup2
TWO THINGS.

03:29:41.469 --> 03:29:44.205 region:rollup2
I THINK YOU SHOULD PUT TOGETHER

03:29:42.570 --> 03:29:46.074 region:rollup2
A LETTER JUST LIKE A LOT OF THE

03:29:44.205 --> 03:29:47.542 region:rollup2
LOCAL COALITIONS HAVE. YOUR

03:29:46.074 --> 03:29:49.577 region:rollup2

DOWNSTREAM OF THAT DAMN.

03:29:58.252 --> 03:30:00.955 region:rollup2
THE SECOND THING THAT THIS

03:29:59.187 --> 03:30:02.990 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE OUGHT TO DO. IS TAKE A

03:30:00.955 --> 03:30:04.659 region:rollup2
HARD LOOK AT THE RELICENSING UP

03:30:02.990 --> 03:30:06.127 region:rollup2
WITH THE STATE WATER CONTRACTORS

03:30:04.659 --> 03:30:08.062 region:rollup2
IN TAKE OUT THOSE CLAWS THAT ARE

03:30:06.127 --> 03:30:10.465 region:rollup2
SELF SERVING.

03:30:08.062 --> 03:30:11.899 region:rollup2
