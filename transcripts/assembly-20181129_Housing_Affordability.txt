estate market and we think it's a it's a good place to be it's a good space to be in because it's it's an affordable space and it's also -- A very sustainable space -- Once you get the formulas down so I'm gonna quickly go over a couple projects were doing -- Just to kind of show. The concept and then I can get into my opinions on my car housing in Michael can you hold the microphone close enough yeah sorry my arm is a a little. Got on my own microphone stand -- Okay so here we go this is -- A property we are currently developing in Logan heights -- It's seventy five hundred square foot lot in which we are able to get municipal code. Legally what. I'm special permissions right twenty one it the the lock was to seize on law and it was really only allowing five units to be built. And so use and density bonus and then we use an FAA are bonus to squeeze in twenty one small apartments which would have normally been five large apartments -- And that's gonna house twenty one people this specific project we are. Really hoping and we're we're targeting -- Specifically -- X. homeless veterans who hold the veteran voucher from the VA. Okay and then -- Another one we're doing -- This one is an escrow on of a lot that's about fourteen thousand square feet -- Were able to fit forty two of these micro units on this property -- The normal allowance for this would have been fourteen large. Town homes or apartments so you can see are maximizing the dirt to fit as many houses as we cannot even other small. So -- So -- She's my little assistant. So -- So that tech kind of give you an idea of what we can do with each size of what -- And also to know these are half market rate and half of them are deed restricted we're working with any of housing commission. In order to do waste -- Mixed use contact with just on chorus -- I can show you what we could do if that say we had unlimited money -- This is a one acre lot also in Logan heights and we would be able to if permitted and funded. Bill three hundred of these units and this would be more of a permanent supportive care housing facility -- This property -- At of it's been in and out of Esther a bunch of times the they keep calling us -- And the reason is because the affordable developers can't close on the deal due to the financing. For some reason they can't get their financing -- So that's something I would love to tackle it's it's an ambitious one who knows maybe we'll get there okay. So just kind of cap over at this was -- I was showing this to the home a select committee kind of showing how much dirt we need to go how many units so on seventy five hundred square feet we are able -- To fit twenty one units. Fourteen thousand square feet forty two units and if you give us an anchor we can fit over three hundred units in this is all housing people -- And so that's kind of confusing idea of per square foot what we can build -- So the the construction we're using is a modular construction we're choosing to you shipping containers -- There's other types of modular construction they're sticking brick modular there is metal panels much of those concrete paneling modular -- And the benefits of these at this that they're built in factories off site and then the units are are fully furnished and then delivered. And then we just place them on site with crane and there you go there's your there's your unit your apartment -- Some of the benefits of this is this. Speed is an obvious benefit -- Because it allows for the development to could be going on while you're also being permitted for your site control. And these things are approved at state level so the city doesn't take the permitting liability -- The state does and then is delivered in all out. Twice what it would take to build it sticks and bricks on the site -- Another cool factor this that we didn't know. Was that if we are forced to use prevailing wages which a lot of portable buildings are and and that's a good. Good thing to be using -- One of the challenges with affordable development is that there's such expensive developments -- Typically in affordable development will cost four hundred thousand dollars per residents delivered -- We've been able to deliver ours were we think we're gonna do four hundred and forty thousand actually might even do it for less -- But on the affordable side the prevailing wage costs is cut by a third because most of the work is being done off site in the factory. So -- That will help affordable developers with their bottom line -- Also cool part of is that the its its warranty it's similar to a cars so. If something goes wrong you know who who to call -- So that's what we're doing. So this this. Power point was really geared toward homelessness so I'm going to quickly go through this because we are aye I'm on the board a path connections and so. That's kind of where I focus -- Our efforts -- Most skip this one so what we're trying to do is rent to homeless people and partner with service providers by using a masterpiece meaning instead of renting each unit -- One at a time we are hoping to rent the entire property -- Under master these which for a landlord that means one check and for the service provider. That means they've got a whole property in which they can run their services we also don't need a conditional use permit if we do a master lease -- And that's also another benefit of master leasing versus doing permits support of care -- It's a much more streamlined process -- This is the master leasing I was talking about so happy landlord -- Makes it simple. So. This is the strategy here serve of basically there's some strategies for mass releasing because the the service providers need service money and they also hold liability because their clients -- They can't be the landlord to their own client so we have to have a property manager in the middle and then the owner. And that's the structure of how you master these so the service writer rents pays the manager the manager in the landlord. Manage the property for the service provider -- And so. Service money is a big deal I don't know if this is the right panel to be speaking about service money on but I will tell you the almost service providers. Really needs service money in order to be able to rent from typical landlords the concept is if we can build this thing so can any other builder and that opens up a new. Supply chain for service providers who need housing for their outgoing -- Clients -- X. almost people that are in care -- And so the service monies really important right now the service providers really need about ten thousand dollars per client every year. Plus the rent money in order to have a successful -- Non reoccurrence of homelessness. So and that solutions lesson so far one of the things about micro housing -- Is that -- Really helps the middle income level -- What we see in San Diego as we have all these houses that a three bedroom two bedroom three bedroom two bath houses? That -- Are still does roommates -- I know I was one once my brother is one and and and people are even families your even cohabitating -- Where there's the you know single parents sharing a house -- Two separate families and so with this micro housing concept really offers that we haven't seen in San Diego. Is that roommates now have another option. So instead of renting a room and sharing a hundred or two hundred dollars more a month you get your own apartment -- Your own bathroom your own kitchen cinnamon stealing your leftovers I know that was I was always the problem for me. And and your own pocket so -- It really does. Fill that need -- And so but there are challenges and so my partner is going to speak to some of the challenges we've had some financing challenges of their concept because it is mixed use market rate. Deed restricted a sorrows as a commercial space -- And so all that him touch on that. Okay [inaudible] Right. Thank you Michael on as that takes over if you need to take off we understand you thank you so much of it as you dogs extremely well behaved very impressed with. Demanded housing development skills thank you she's much more professional than me yes -- I'm my name's Doug arms I'm going to see if you all don't mind. The more comfortable that way -- My Michael's partner in -- Makana properties and I've been and developer builder and San Diego for thirty plus years now so I have. A great deal of experience in non affordable housing. Building and construction I met up with. Years ago and you tell me what it was doing in the affordable housing space and I got really excited about it so I partnered up with him. And here we are today. So we've we've come up with the concept -- Of he didn't he didn't mention this bed were worried needed mission were using the modular housing. Another piece of our model is that. We're really seeking no public financing so. Our project is under percent privately financed and we believe that. With the efficiency of the construction method for the at the container units both in terms of entitlements and construction. Paired with the private financing model. We have a very. Viable solution to putting a dent in the affordable housing crisis that it's probably better than most because our time from. Property acquisition to completion. We are targeting less than a year. Which is pretty impressive -- Michael talked about the pastor least being. Concept -- Service provider or some other Writer -- I'm gonna talk about the possibilities of not getting the masterly switches which you know where we're kind of learning as we go. Because it's such a novel concept -- We don't know for gonna get master these or not still all our alternative. Our water are there. We have some problems in our of alter are took his his me of our alternatives -- So are a project requires no public financing. Were currently working with the housing commission to read restrict but technically we're not required -- To we are passionate about affordable housing and we want to make this an affordable housing project. The housing commission for the S. R. O. S. R. O. units. Is providing a voucher rate rental -- Which is which makes the prop economically feasible. IBM is is that permanent lenders. Don't land on tenant based vouchers there's going to look at the market rate [inaudible] So. In order for us as an incentive. To make this an intolerable affordable housing project. We're trying to work a system out with the housing commission. And the city of San Diego council to come up with a way. To essentially guarantee -- As a voucher rate grant for all of our units Doug I'm very started wretched there may be a problem with that particular microphone would you mind using the wireless one okay okay. If you -- So. So what we're trying to get a day rental guarantee on the battery units in order to incentivize as to not make to to make that the project affordable -- The current no for is. Available to the San Diego housing commission -- Really. Don't we don't have any opportunities in those no phase -- The way they are structured now to get any subsidies. From San Diego San Diego housing commission so what we're really doing. Is appealing to the city of San Diego. Council in mayor to come up with another funding source to subsidize our vouchers. At if we don't you know we do there are options are going to it and entirely market rate. Project and you know maybe having to step out of the affordable space. So our theory is this the housing commission right now is. Paying -- Current SRO owners. Quite a bit of money to extend their as sorrows for another ten years -- When we're offering? Twenty one brand new as sorrows into the housing stock. In our only request is that we get some sort of voucher rent subsidy. So we're thinking that. If we push hard enough we can probably get make make a solution out of that -- The concept is scalable if we are able to get through our financing hurdles. We could do this we could put three to four hundred units. On the street in the next two to three years and which is far ahead of your typical. Tax credit. Affordable housing developers so we're really excited about the concept. And we'll have to see where it goes. Thank you dot org of what transition out of Mister gentry for going to secure nay -- We think your patience while we took care of Michael on the child care needs that I know you understand that kind of stuff -- Problem around Todd in. The streaking of the weather. Is one of the good folks at recruited me and brought me here ten years ago. Rain is fine -- Let me. Set a little bit of a a perspective here on the nature of the problem well we've got it for the missing metal that is. And instrument hope the dog that well we're working on with you and mark we can make work out. There sure is taking money that flows down. In vertical streams with. Rooms and and regulations and restrictions attached to it. Which makes me think about it and nobody in their right mind going hand on order and taxpayers money. Local government officials without some strings attached to it they're just not going to happen. Initial making sure the the the the attached requirements. Are dapple adaptable enough to fit local circumstances which may not always fit. Then is out of the funding trains in this part of the mission here. In a large room or broader sense. This whole issue of housing commission was set up nearly forty years ago. To serve the housing needs primarily people who are low and moderate income. And that's typically low income is typically defined as 80% of median whatever. In our most all of the money that comes in to us is for folks that. Income level or lower. Most Mister over 50% of median or less some. Begin in the homelessness Arambula. Or elderly and disabled folks Of reach of those are the name for a subsidy -- Addition in order to make the the economics work. The issue is what happens when you get into folks in the middle income range. Which is typically defined as about depending on their own circumstances. Number. Of a that -- With those people -- Which creates a problem let me give you an example. If you go back about eight years ago. In the middle of the Great Recession. The housing commission which among other -- Programs under that bridge about thirty seven hundred and as hard and it's of housing -- Which have Reyes of degrees of subsidy attached to it. We had a turnover rate of about So over a three year time period would you won't turn over the inventory. People have something new. To in one of the server running is a plan to the Great Recession is over a lot there was a lot of naturally occurring affordable housing developed. And available back then. When I moved to Tara biggest housing problems for closures? We had more housing bills and then then the market could take care. So the issue background 35%. The turnover rate right now no units. This 14%. It takes seven noted Turner product inventory over for people to move up and out. As you can you can do the math on that the difference between thirty five and 14%. Is a man's a paper to have a place to move. To are you going to the private sector about compassion from for conventional run apartments. Is 50% a year. So what it tells you the people that can afford to market place can move they can move up and out. Of people who cannot afford that. Cannot. The jump in the price tag is just too big. Let me give you numbers the numbers just illustrates. In San Diego right now the two bedroom apartment rents for about two thousand two hundred and seven dollars. That comes from a rich study done in October of this year. But I household earning 80% of the area median income. Which is 770-008-0050 dollars for a family of four can afford to pay using 30% should. Can afford to played one thousand six hundred and seventy three dollars per month. After you take out an eighty dollar adjustment for typical mentally utilities. That leaves a difference of five hundred and thirty four dollars per month. With a lower income hassle can afford. In the market rent for two bedroom apartment. And the so there's there's nothing this plus the metal between that affordability number. It we'll the family can afford to pay. Because virtually no production a middle income housing in that time period. For the period. Seventeen the city of San Diego produced. Only. Thirty three units and that's what I mean two digits three three thirty three units. Of middle income housing. In that time period. Ins in seven years personal population one point three million people. As is obvious this lack of supply -- Moderate income housing. Affects the the city's market place to attracting key people who are -- Necessary folks but don't have a great deal of income. People are teachers first respond or social services folks. The need of a sentiment parleys and sexual to the economy. We cannot afford the rent and in this gap is where we come to carve the missing middle -- This last year of Mister Gloria some assembly member Gloria someone call you city council member. The assembly member Gloria -- Introduced AB. Sixteen thirty seven a state -- Bill which the governor signed to learn October of last year. Which allows. To which initially allowed to public housing agencies in the state. Both last June San Diego and also Santa Clara county. Who -- Try this intentional so stroller developers image don't come developments where there was a mixture of low income and moderate income folks in the development. And the center county San Bernardino letter themselves of this makes this year as well. So now there are three localities here in California. Trying to make this thing work. And one of the difficulties in it is -- Well when promised me set this up. For very good reason. Eserver would not use any of the subsidies for the lower income people. There are many properties work for moderate income people. You know to cannibalize one sort of programs in college. We're sort of problems for very poor people help those were in the middle. Make their own way. And it means that we the the the the guy is. Wearing an experimental time period now. To try to make this thing work -- Will also introduce a second bloom -- A. B. twenty three seventy two of the casa act. Which will help to address the same issue. And what of we're going to be doing is trying to figure out a way to make. Of the production missing that. The meme got too many pieces of paper homeowners. Aimed steady the the housing commission produced last year like to refer you to is what I'm a give you a website address for the housing commission. Is WWW dot S. the H. soon for the same vehicle housing commission. Dot org or just Google us. Well the stuff on the website it is a good. One we produced a study by the mackenzie folks in September. Seventeen that -- Identified. Goals for the city of San Diego needs to produce in terms of new housing units. Over the final in ten years at all income levels. This would brown from Twenty eight and then it showed that we need to produce in order to keep up and or catch up With. Normal projected population growth. You need to increase our housing stock -- Anywhere from a hundred and housing. Over the next ten years. That means we need to produce between. Seventeen thousand new units of housing to keep up. And twenty four thousand units per year to catch up. Over the next ten years. The largest number of housing units so we produced in San Diego for the last five years. Was [inaudible] Six thousand four hundred well. The cost of Transoxiana higher over the last few years. Supply simple supply and demand. The more demand is less ride. Coasters up. Who gets pushed out of the bottom and who's missing in the middle? This report of one out of one ahead to show that this is a solvable this can be dealt with. If there's no will to do it. In fact the study points out five different areas to those in the study that I can going to run to a bed. Was this the the housing can be produced. The was always is going to be for those however who cannot afford the market place. Had a make up for of of what doctor very well a few minutes ago. The gap financing to bridge between the missing level -- Income rise and what they can market place. Thank you. Thank you Mister gentry -- It will -- We have. You know a stickler for time restaurants president I which I keep these things going right -- So I wanna make sure we get to our second panel but just perhaps of a couple of points and I appreciate it -- Michael's comments about almost as babies slightly disconnected from the discussion today about working and middle class housing but I want to just be very clear I think they're very much connected and that our inability to build. Middle income housing is pushing -- Folks up full time jobs into units of adorably be occupied by folks with far more modest means and means of those units are now -- Pushing almost people out on the streets right this is dysfunctional housing economy that we have -- That's you know meant most obviously manifested by are homeless but also speaking to what Michael mentioned about families doubling tripling up and you know young adults dean in a roommate situation much being played out across our community are I think seen and unseen every single day. And so I do appreciate the inclusion of the discussion of homelessness and today's conversation is very focused on a higher economic class -- But a very much related all of us are tied up into this housing crisis and all of us have a role to play in fixing it. Up if if I can't -- Just a couple questions for Doug with your on the proposal's these are great slides I think of vision of what the future may look like. In a world where we need to build a second amount more housing at a lower cost -- Where you at a with -- This particular project in terms of the the development process sure -- We are -- We're almost entirely there were there designed were anticipating submitting to the city for building permits and a couple weeks -- Which for their container type projects -- The city approval. Is pretty much just the foundation site plan utilities. And the the whole modular portion of the building is state approval so Senate discretionary review by the city council no playing video. We're not asking for any variances in it's just pretty much a straight a building permit. So for Californians it think that this is somewhat exotic this completely fits within a lot of the code and is a fairly normal that's kind of our model is our our entitlement process. If this had to go through DST and and and the building department this is a six month ordeal -- Because the billing department. And then it it will still go through DST but we've already. Submitted for a preliminary approval through them. And gotten very positive feedback and they they frankly -- Deferred a lot of their review to the housing commission regarding the S. R. as but so -- Or intent when for design -- But our entitlement time we're estimating maximum the month month and a half while yeah. And then and then construction time on top of that. Because of the containers one level is dropped in one day. So our our can total construction time for this project is probably four months. Total while -- But in the end you have to be it I develop expert understand a quick. Right with all with all went. To that would take longer than that right yeah -- In in I guess what's excited that that is there's we trying to grapple with the size and scale this particular problem. The need for innovation in the space pretty obvious in this seems like innovative solution. But it does fit well within existing regulatory environment I mean yes you need it AB. Sixteen thirty seven five to work in this space a little bit but on the whole the distal existing develop a code supports this development it does I mean are. We are are well within the to the the zoning code flora ratio it's after it center center so where are. You know. The end and being privately financed also frankly is really expedites process if we had to apply for public funds and and wait around for that. It would it would kind of Brecher model -- Set is so the key to our problem as I said really is. Figuring out a way to get permanent financing on the project. And committing to and affordable -- Model got kind of an of perhaps you the video at the live stream right now that. This is happening here but it could happen in their communities -- To there are I think that there's and the couple projects in LA and people are are are kind of getting yeah. I don't know if they are quite. Using the S. R. O. model that we are. I guess our Ozer differently defined India in every municipality -- So but yeah that the word is is getting out okay and then just there was the comment about -- With reduction the Costa prevailing wages but the point is is that you still prevailing wages on the onsite work correct -- We're not required to and and less we take public subjects take some public substance correct it if you did you what. If we did -- Are at the impact of prevailing wages to us is substantially reduced because most of the work -- Is done in the factory with the pre fab containers but the work that would be need to be done on site which would. Fall under that. The yeah they've got the work done Ste wage if if we if the project were were preventing which brought understood. Exciting stuff appreciating is to very quickly the network -- Need to possibly on the next panel -- This yet you we did some good work together I think. Sixteen thirty seven twenty three seventy two any ideas you know part of the the the deliverable from this hearing is intended to be legislative concepts that we can -- Introduced practice it is next Monday I'll give us more time that but anything right now that you can. Maybe identifies areas that we should work on in the new legislative session. Of the cans are roses making the numbers work making the money for that. And I think is right to go to be mixed income housing with different Stratotanker homes. And multifamily setting there will be huge making around the system works -- I think the everything that can be done to lower construction cost chambers Mister home just mention it is wonderful. To but I think that if there's gonna be a gap. The problem now gap in money. There's a need to fill that gap and think mixed income where you get different income strat in the same property. Is largely going to be a way that works out. Agree provide some form of redevelopment and to provide you some state. Investment in these projects -- Remains be seen how we necessarily fit better finance that the state has its own budget -- To but it is a lot of energy -- In the assembly caucus to do that -- We had a bill this past session was not successful -- But was a pulmonary attempted this and I said I would welcome eternity gentleman's input on what that should look like in. Twenty nineteen it's really the audiences well -- I'd no doubt the bill be introduced and what form it what details may be seen and making sure that we eliminate the excesses of the past in the in the abuses of the past. But really fine tuning honing in so that homelessness but I think also on middle income housing -- Would be is really what I to to try and influence to be involved in this process so -- To be continued. John thank you very much for your time a last the next that said a panelist to come forward and staff will help but folks out to get situated. Steve held my distractor room I'm also here at your service and how they're Gomez from my team here is. I'm also a point as an account to be here today at the city's it. Sir early slow a is here as well as our planning director my Kansen guy thank you both for being here for the innovative stuff you're doing. At the city of San Diego. I'm calling Clements from -- Sandbags here thank you so much. Housing transportation these things go together right we have to we have to work together my roast us from a lucid. Well Hans take a San Diego I did it myself briefly -- Is is here I mission is individuals because I'm not presenting today -- But I appreciate the the collaboration -- That your presence here -- Indicate -- And indication that we're trying to work on all this collectively right -- And then we have in a couple of like to officials offices are present this out afternoon there pro tem -- Our own Toni Atkins please tell Tony hello -- And if markets bush -- From. I'm not I almost accounts president but see I million ahead of myself councilmember Georgette Gomez please tell accounts number appreciate her -- Collaboration -- Acosta bill this year I think that's going to be the news for next year what we got done in the twenty eighteen session and then last but certainly not least out a raft Democrat for about council president medicals office. A murder that old and dear friend and she's in her service to the city San Diego soon -- We thank her for all for leadership on housing for so many years please thing myrtle five thank you. OB I see our next panel is. At the table thank you guys so much for being a position -- We're gonna start off with low about filing -- From habitat for humanity low is an old friend it's great to see you here of please take it away glad to be here. See my side to ready to go. On really glad to be talking about the missing middle and thinking about all the efforts that are going on and they know that housing. Just just to give some a conversation to the public into the elected officials that we need housing and it's okay to vote for housing. It's difficult to do that. I'm also again again let Rick and you said about of Sam Neill wouldn't the cost of housing is so high that the missing the middle or taking up the low income housing. It when I'm trying to build housing for low income families and I go to a rotary club and I'm trying to you know Chen up so many for low income housing and you're looking at a whole aye audience. Of people can't afford a house themselves as hard to get at expand the supply for low income housing. Is gets more difficult. So I just wanted to share a little bit about what hand habitat does and we build new homes we partner with families. That are -- We partner with families to help they will help build their own home we build with volunteers and we partner with city so it takes a lot of effort to bring -- House together and we sell the this is an example some people of asked when you build with volunteers what does the house look like. It looks like a very nice house like any housing when with that went to live in and they're pretty proud to be able to help both at home and to be able. To afford that home at the 30% a level so I have a couple of examples and if you start at the bottom. Of this is a families income in at your fifty thousand dollars at 30% they have twelve hundred dollars available for their a housing costs. You have to add the mortgage taxes insurance an H. away so that's the twelve hundred and seventy one so we will tell the home to the family. At to their first mortgage would be two hundred and nineteen thousand dollars habitat would end up with a silent second I would look for down payment assistance wherever we can. Fortunately for one project the housing commission is providing I'm some have died down payment assistance really appreciate that a great deal so they're not family will be in that home for two hundred and twenty thousand dollars. At the home itself cost us four hundred thousand dollars so it's a lot of fund raising fifty than. This is another -- Another family -- Just is similar Levin hundred dollars is available for housing they would have a mortgage once again we just divide their hot income. By 30% to figure out what they're housing cost so a ten am very beneficial to the families because that's where they can build wealth -- We want them to be a part of the community they become part of the fabric of the community they also need. For that -- Bill there up. Yeah. Hundred ninety two thousand that they pay to habitat. This last family is a moderate and in a middle income family so when you think about the opportunity to provide for that missing middle -- What kind of subsidy would it take and in this particular project we have a -- The land was provided to us at a very low cost so then our housing costs are about four hundred thousand makes it so that this family can afford their entire mortgage. In there's no subsidy -- In that sense except for the 0% mortgage. So they're they're at their monthly amount available for housing nineteen hundred and seventy four you get the markets taxes insurance an H. away. In there that says that still a good example of what we could provide -- And a backup when we think about what you need for future -- Legislation you've talked about -- Redevelopment as an opportunity where also looking at sequel reform habitat in California just got -- So resolve the and frivolous lawsuit a sequel lawsuit it held the project up for two and a half years a neighbor that. Protested the project Acosta to pay for that -- Or fund raise for it that habitat did in. That particular habitat dead so sequel reform is very important also -- So when we think about this a surplus land that the state of California has or cities have we need some clarification on that. Because which I think the rules are you supposed to get the highest and best price but if we really need a willing at affordable housing middle income housing low income housing. And maybe state could think about transferring that land to a land trashed making it permanently available for affordable housing -- In in a lot of different ways so that would be one way that would help and also I think there's some clarification for special districts because of the water district owns it. They don't really wanna make it. They don't want to lose that asset to the from the repair so I think there's some conversation ask to go along with that. And also developer impact fees -- Are they proportionate for the cost of the home and what we're building. So just a couple of ideas for the middle income aspect of this. Thank you Laurie -- I think Jim is next up on are advertised agenda okay. Thank you very much and I and kills member of being tied to the same thing on behalf of the local economic development. Corporation EDC is a recently adopted a very visionary program called inclusive economic development and it's quite exciting when. You add the word inclusive and from the words economic development. And one of the tears of that is affordability and obviously a huge part of affordability is housing. One of the things that we're trying to do is to develop better data sets so that instead of people just talking in a totally. Were talking through their own biases we use data one of the studies that we're working on now is to develop a good data on the various layers of income strategy in the community. We're trying to match that with building permits and housing to graphically show what we all intuitively know. And that is that there's a big hole in the middle but we want to use the data for that. There's a there's another fundamental point of lead into my ideas for legislative action costs to a project. Assuming incomes art level then the number of people that can qualify necessarily goes down the cost of a certain percent of your consumers of your market. Cannot afford to buy the property or cannot afford to rent the property. And we want again be able to quantify that. And all all of our use an example of one that that a lot of people have said to us in this is not send the political context and not even said from an agenda point of view. They deeply believe from their analysis of the numbers. That the city of San Diego increases its inclusionary housing level. From 10220% and if it goes to a prevailing wage standard nothing will be built. It won't not be built because people are angry and take their marbles and go home it will not be built. Because the numbers will not work and you're gonna have even a bigger gap between the affordable that a subsidized and the market that to some extent immune from these things. And again those things have to be done with data and that's complicated in walls a lot of issues. And we just talk about some things and somebody's there are a lot of it's funny very similar worries. But in our community tied the water quality control board storm water management requirements that they imposed -- My adjective arrogantly. My age if but today imposed having have. Dramatically impacted our ability to do. Housing in San Diego and I'm not talking about green field here that's different even a big project you're designing from scratch you can build a lot of systems and so I'm. Specifically talking about in cell the legislature does have the authority. To go in and and legislative around a water quality control board mandate those numbers are twenty to forty thousand dollars I personally was trying to do some infill projects very simple infill projects. And I happen to get caught in the switches windy when those laws came into effect. The water quality control board does not tell the city's what they have to do. But they tell the city so that they don't do what the water quality control board wants him to do the board will find them. So the city's naturally take a belt and suspenders approach and I would say I personally got clobbered because no one knew what to do so I would urge the legislature and I know that's not easy. It's consultant people talk about water quality but again infill if you think about in filament shark in mature communities. It's it's such a small thing. Arm. The CC date again I'm nomina for likely to exceed eagle had I am a passionate advocate for renewable energy. But the C. E. C. mandate for all housing in California to have solar after these two thousand twenty or maybe beginning in. Two thousand twenty is it is a financial disaster. It's going to add twenty thousand dollars at least of the cost of each year a single family residence. Now into McAllister said well but you'll get that in savings that's mathematically incorrect it presupposes a certain level of utility consumption and most people don't have. So I would -- Eight in the match and thanks to won't give you credit for that so when they're under writing helping alone you can get into warriors ratios. Trust me they're not going to say -- G. Jim's utility bill went down four dollars a month so I'm gonna capitalize that increases mortgage. So that's a pure cost that will again every cost shrinks the the number of people that -- They can qualify for a given product -- Laurie mentioned seek reform I and it's incredibly complicated. The the the lawsuits that the tactical lawsuits are what upsets people it isn't being environmentally conscious it's it's just being is being used as a weapon. If you could just add an attorney prevailing party attorneys fees costs. To the sequel so that people have to think seriously and I I understand the social argued against that for people that don't have that capacity but it's got to be carefully thought of but something that simple will would have. Kept that neighbor from doing what they did to you and you wouldn't have that expense -- Doing infill site small projects if we if and if you have full lots are less you don't have to go through the some. Map actively for the three birds in the feel like a leasing là maybe you take that for making eight I don't know what the number is. Which you increase that number soul larger percent of your properties can be done at our at at without going to the subdivision map act and what that would do it within the zoning within the community. If I I I was involved the piece of property that the prior owner subdivided into four lights it was a huge in for it should have been. Eight within the community standards it was for why because it was easier so there's four lots off the off the inventory so just a little thing like that. From then some other things that apply probably not so much at the state level but I think no cities it. Is off the charts again I was there. One city just in my opinion extorted me on that were as good city Chula Vista allows you just sign something that runs with the land it's as if the street is ever expanded. You will test you will consistency. The provide the second be anyway. So that would be one the other thing is incremental under grounding of utilities. It's it it's probably ten X. two underground a half a block than it is to underground a mile. Of utilities if we believe is a people the underground electric utilities is a good public outcome. The net should be a C. P. you see imposed three that applies to all ratepayers is managed by the utility. And if they do it scale. And you don't impose that on individual property owner because it it does just one infill in particular just turn your numbers upside down I was Limón girls. Six houses we want to bring them all in under four hundred fifty thousand dollars. The combination of the underground and cost and the and the half wood street improvements and I and now it will permanently forever never be one house and said a six and I I know enough about this community to know there are. Thousands and thousands maybe tens of thousands of units locked up through these little. Of policies that I would certainly like to Laurie mentioned the deaths. I mean the the the development impact fees the traffic impact fees or or out of control again I don't think it's the state but I would like. To to to say you cannot collect the fee for anything you don't plan to build in ten years. Make it very finite. Because again I was in a project right to pay fees for road and managed they had scheduled for two thousand and two thirds Ritesh. SO you get if you don't within ten years you can't charge me the death now I take some administrative work but once the systems up and running I think I think that would take care of itself and I would make it. In not take any Jean a money out of defines for any purpose when you build the project can you maybe do 5%. So those are just a few ideas that I think and can. In a lot of a conserve personal experience autumn comes from work I've done. In the public and the private sector -- Then I I think with their a lot of people believe me that want to build middle income housing in our community. There's property there it's already zone it is ready to go and the the series of little things incrementally grammatically incrementally add up make the projects impossible. Great Jim thank you very much and good ideas and there are last on this panel is popping up that Dr Sir the floor is yours. Thank you very much. Jennifer you gonna cheat up Coming -- Just before the see my power point work down here work years working fine right. What are they while we're waiting I just want to say that? I'd I'd none of my projects from the city of asking of the city of San Diego but the city San Diego probably as for all the criticism against prop is the best reputation of any city in the county. In terms of trying to work to get make things happen so thanks guys. Good afternoon and thank you for coming out for the public hearing this afternoon -- We have a high housing crisis and that's why we're all here. But more importantly we have a another car the housing that no one's really talking about. And and so as a member of the two hundred I'm here to talk about the home ownership crisis. Others a lot of talk about affordable housing which is needed but there's also need to have more homeowners particularly for people with the of middle income us hours a lot of working class individuals. So that's going to be the nature of my presentation I want to build on some of the ideas that Laurie and then Jim have talked about. They're they're the experts in the field there their builders and and so -- More de ideas I'm gonna be discussing is is all of the more concept. So at the table back here is is a copy this of of of my presentation there's gonna be a number of graphs. Not you know I don't know if you can see those numbers very well but if you want more detail. There are they'll be there in the back. So the the the problem from my perspective is that there is a tremendous wealth gap between of white and and and ethnic minorities and it was exacerbated during the Great Recession. And so this is a a charter was put together by the by the pew. Institute and in thirteen of the the the wealth gap between blacks and whites was -- Thirteen times the at the white -- Of wealth was to thirteen times more than blacks and then ten times for them of Latinos or Hispanics. And and and that's a problem that maybe has improved just from -- We bet but probably not enough. And and and homeownership can can address that -- Wealth gap -- Going forward. This is a of some information up -- On data from the federal home -- So station on loans and you can see that over from. Nineteen thirty four to nineteen sixty two the differences in terms of the the the the the value of real estate loans made to whites versus blacks in this particular case. Just a big big big difference and then over to right you can see the big difference in terms of the the investment that. Both communities have earned during that same period. Very big difference and so then if you take those. hand side you have both real estate and investment value for whites which is now. A five trillion dollars during this period of time I'm sure it's gone up. Another five trillion dollars of thanks to the of the 1%. Of it but then in the right you have that of the ethnic minorities ethnic minorities from those. For those two charts right there represents less than 2%. Of of of what the White real estate values and investments have been during that that period of time. So if -- If you want to read more about of the discrimination that is taking place over the years this is an excellent book. There's a lot of stories in there to it it's just going to blow your mind you know you you you you it highlights how of red line you know I I thought. That that that the banks were responsible for red light that's the federal government they came up with that they they they wrote memos so how to redline communities and then. Of course everybody else -- Waldron so excellent book right now -- This is provided by the California association of realtors and and the idea behind this chart is to this to this to determine. Whether the the various ethnic groups are buying at at the at that their at at the there pro rata share of the population so everybody if every household up there. By ethnicity was buying -- One one home for houses out there it would be at zero so what you have on the on the on the on the very top is at roughly -- Whites are buying -- their parity and and the courts deadly the Hispanics which is down below they're they're they're buying about 17% less than their parents or another words. The way they did the math and this one is that in two thousand fourteen of Hispanic households was about 38% -- Of of California and then when you take a look at the when you take a look at the hot tub household ownership it's 22% so. Twenty two from thirty eight to seventeen so a still a lot of disparity that. So there's a number of factors that the going to why -- We have this housing crisis can blame it on line cost labor costs. Over regulation sequel for sure -- You know everyone blames it on greedy developers but the fact is. Is it it's this supply in if you were to ask of of former president Bill Clinton he would probably say. He would policy it's the supply stupid. And so -- And they're a lot of contribute a reason why. So in California. We have here of as of two thousand can't read that over there are. Two thousand seventeen eighteen up. Of the number of homes built versus multi family so over here in in about nineteen eighty six of those -- Disproportion number of of apartment was the result of a lot of federal -- Incentives that were provided to developers then they lost some so then they stop building as many apartments then in about ninety in the nineteen nineties it was a big real estate recession recession as well but really. Really big of real estate recession and then again at two thousand seven it's the beginning of the Great Recession and so we're not just getting out about. Soul the far right. They're projecting that to just to stay at at equilibrate you need to build a hundred eighty a thousand homes here but that. So quickly -- County the most under bill county. And take a look at how job this person's housing permits. Of so the problem is the good news is a lot of jobs the bad news is there's no housing and therefore goes up. So down payment. When it was? But now was the housing finance agency has a program that can provide of down payment assistance what can San Diego county. I think that number is -- Less than a hundred fifty seven thousand roughly so -- There is a lot of assistance there so pretty much you can get both the down payment and any mortgage from from -- Cal of housing finance agency to to buy a home at about seven hundred thousand and that number and and that they're going to increase that limit -- Here beginning in January -- Lot of mortgages up there the problem is. You know. The buyers you to be aware of of the cell old mortgages that got us in trouble. Ten years ago. So. A lot of emphasis has been put on affordable housing but there rentals and the problem with rentals that you can never building the wealth. And so -- What -- The two hundred has been advocating for more -- Home homeownership quickly. You know -- The there was an opportunity a years ago to do a lot more fix and flip. But those fix implicit were being. Converted to rentals now I'm proposing to do fix and flips and and and and and sold to first time home buyers. This is example of some of it was an old a GM plant in east Oakland. Was converted into beautiful of community there of this is another urban infill condos in Sacramento but these. Soul recently in the five point. Five hundred thousand so -- That's the type of product ID like to see available for the for the middle income and working class. So there's a lot of local fixes -- Back back to be done -- And you can you can read more about it if you pick up. Presentation -- So [inaudible] Five phone that would enable us small lot developers and other people but they can they can buy these homes. Renovate them and then sell to first time home buyers of is is is the big idea behind this right now -- So if you do this. Of the whole community benefits by that because there's a lot of people that have the money but that their to product it's just not available we can't afford a million dollar. Home and at the same time they can't afford to live in affordable rental rentals because they make more than 80% of the median income. So -- So the the whole idea about getting people to homes it's it's going to close the wealth gap you can spend more time with the families. Of their of their of their of their family budgets what are not gonna be stretch because right now we of their driving you know. Probably a hundred fifty miles a day. And that status for expensive. So -- I'll just leave it with that. Thank you Robert of cash should go back on the slides to the the bar graph showing the the housing production or lack there of California. Is as we do Q. and a and maybe to lex person as a presentation I think at least a graphically illustrates the challenge that you it was here and try to get them to understand the scale the size of what we're discussing it what we kind of need to hit. Where we are today -- I think this is the slide that when I've seen in the past I think just brings home for the average constituent we're talking about and why every neighborhood has to do its part of the city must do its part -- Hopefully you all got from organizing of this panel is a more about -- Single family development or sort of free standing -- Non makes non multi family product -- As well as this -- What rob was getting out -- About homeownership and that you know we talk a lot about the rent but we also we don't always talk it nearly as often about people's ability to actually transfer to being first time home buyers. In developing the wealth that really envisioned you stained. A California for long haul right as talk about you eight we tested a lot in their education An attack. Arizona of a nay and that's a that's a huge minutes insult the taxpayers who who help to do that any kids want to stay right but it gets to the central issue that you're. And so -- Toni Atkins -- When -- When she was in the assembly did get of -- So much just station passed and she did put to put in some money for homeownership and then most recently. I think it was with prop one or prop to with the prop to whether a veterans housing so. The good news is all about money a hundred and fifty million dollars is going over -- To California housing finance agency for this down payment assistance program. They have the ability I'm not sure how they do it -- There's somebody here staff member you're you might tell us how how they do it but they're able to leverage it twenty seven times so that. Hundred through through private sources funny so that one hundred and fifty million is not going to be -- A little over four billion. And so -- That's going to be able to provide down payment assistance to about fifteen thousand individuals. So it's it's the it's a it's it's a tremendous program and more money is going to programs like that. Thank you Bob wills we're hill from college FAM in the next panel Lloyd thank you number one for a knowledge in their lives his here -- Housing matters I think it's important have cheerleaders for housing -- And and that's what the organization does and hopefully we can every can you do their part -- You mention a number of legislative ideas when you mentioned that -- Animates me as surplus land -- Even with my own assembly district the state has a tremendous amount of land under utilized -- With zero intention of utilizing any better -- my staff and exploring currently on parcel specific -- Piece of land that it just preview -- We've really old state building in two full city blocks in downtown San Diego with zero housing and wants to make a lot of sense so -- They may see a bill from you shortly to try and force the force to hand on that parcel. Key talk more about that concept that what you personally be observing and what you think would be -- Useful in a potential legislative concept to to better utilize that publicly only. So what I would have seen -- Land become available and hi after and the land for so to speak in order the housing on it so -- It there and it's not clear to the agencies what they're supposed to get or how they're supposed to offer it at so some clarity would be very helpful. Some so clarity -- Even a prioritization. And priorities yeah so a very ation of that -- Is where the the the public agency does not sell the land but makes it available gives the developer a long term lease. And on that long term lease they can get financing then to build condominiums a bill homes and so what happens is then you have a shared appreciation lease. So -- So it. By not having to pay for that line up front the developer then can the build. The homes or or condos and then the public agency can get their money back over time. And that's a great concept that almost promoted by. Low you may think you what Laurie made mention of such a copper special districts as an right fast but I don't think I got what you're trying to say so. So I one piece of land that became available to us. That they put out was from a water district and so we wanted to after them zero for it and they don't want except zero because of what they're water repairs paid for the land. So and I know that and sometimes -- A so that the rate payers are made whole a new future years housing dollars to pay for the land -- But if they're not told that that's what they need to do or that there's a priority for building housing then they won't follow through with that. Okay. Get some ideas. On Jimmy had some awesome ideas -- I think we've made mention of these and perhaps other settings -- The course -- Half with street improvements so I got Voepel eight years the city council not knowing what you're talking about can you clarify what that is sure I'm again I use an example of that name in the jurisdiction we were doing a with in the middle of a very long walk. But it legal on block -- There were four houses on two acres aim is a tragic miss usual and but that's another issue we probably at a hundred yards maybe a hundred and twenty yards of frontage. So the city wanted us to come into the street and this is a mature street. And do a scholarship in. Bill the half with with curb gutter and sidewalk and scholar back out. I'm the worst flooding Rangers. It's not functional and it's a stupid waste of money -- And again the my way to handle to the city believes that as a future interest in possibly widening the street. Then you make me reserve an easement. And agreed not contested so I'm not saying you abandon it. Just coincidently the place rather for thirty years there's a easement in front of my house and such okay but you can't but you low those numbers. Up front -- You warm up front to the the reference to the way that cost for that particular project to do well the the to build it would have been about sixty five thousand dollars this was part of the two thousand and thirty five traffic improvement. Study yes and are they allowed me to buy out of it for forty thousand dollars cash. Which I would bet you -- Nguyen in their general fund. Which makes it legal yeah. We can. One what about deaths in. About the legacies of of the communities and I've. The one thing a we've learned if if you look at the city of San Diego a few the south of ninety four tiny look at the districts the deaths are a lot higher there. Now Robert mentioned redlining you know a lot we're still living with the legacies of of of segregation were living with the second of the legacies of racial profiling. So if you look for most of our land is in the city of San Diego. It's actually south of the ninety four the south of the ninety four has the highest deaths. Why is that it's because historically it was community of color so that wasn't capital invested in? It's fundamentally unfair and I think it just continues a pattern. Of of in inadvertent in today's age but it continues a pattern of underdevelopment. And it might be impossible but I think would be interesting if this instead of being district by district. Or committee by community were in the entire the some portion of it was in the entire city. So that you can get money into these neighborhoods because the numbers of the value of the unit you produce is not high enough to support. The deaths that are indirectly the result of past political decisions to wonder invest. That address the issue of conserve you're describing of we can't build in ten years dot Charlie for right because you know in many cases these monies are seen accounts going on spent and the really hard question is this the political society have an obligation to collectively put money. Into a place that have historically under invested in. As a hard one but I got some visions for equity agenda for the city that I think gets to what you're talking. To yeah on it last I'd say the subdivision map act idea makes a ton of sense to me -- It kind of feels it quickly from law would have a similar approach to maybe the state's recent actions on as as we go on units. Of you to do so the at the state level they could really functionally increase the number of actual doors being bill in communities took the communities of maybe generally resistant -- To to housing development is that right deferred of my friends the city San Diego has been a leader in that they know a lot more about those things and then I then I do so I would for to them. Added because I did not know whether many have been built and how that's worked out to the city's trying to make that happen. This really incentivize in and I would echo the kudos you why with the city's -- And that's impressive in you know I I one of my usual of complaints is that said it is a lead as much as it needs to or should -- In this regard it is leaking -- And it's a that it's by it legislation was not successful not this year at least -- But stay tuned I think what you prove something as a concept it's it working in communities and actually enriching communities looks more likely to do but I'm not possible without actual examples of thank you guys for what you're doing -- But I I think that's an area of that with this committee would be very should pursuing a piece of legislation as you say leading -- Useful and under utilized makes zero sense gets built mortar Roberts point I think you're saying because you're type a single family home felt aye freestanding. Stuff that we actually create for sell product. And and get another very common problem exists we talk about special districts or water districts and sewer districts and again be anybody in this room has tried to do any project is encountered this you come in and you're the last person or you're at that sort of the and they come. And say Gee for your five units you the need I'm only can much I understand but you're the last person to show up. Now I'm not sure which is slated we how you deal with that but to not have the last property standing. Have to do a disproportionate load and what is in my opinion an essential social service like water sewer for example. Is is really hurting and again what are we talking about to limit infill existing communities middle income housing. And it's really putting an unfair burden. The way and the the way the Mathis down within these districts and I've I've seen a lot and I'm sure everybody else has also. Taken a we got over a little time here so I'll I'll take you very much for your time and your your contributions this afternoon thank you all. Three I'll call up the next panel and will bring them forth -- Yeah might just you know give some homework to my public agencies who are here but as you hear so these ideas if any of them stand out. To you from the city or stand at either so the advocate groups who are here -- I certainly be interested in your feedback on as we develop the proposal it's something you think. We can do -- At that would certainly make it -- Vice things that we could enter. It does but it is instance here caption steps and and if you can bet it out and share with your agency organization would support it -- That would be extremely helpful as we before developing these concepts are surrounded our next panel -- Which focused on middle income production minimums -- Jerry made it welcome thank you that is how it should be a lot of effort to be here. Visit how many cities today to be present a couple. Crossed over into Mexico for a little bit. In to Phoenix and sadly Las Vegas have to do that too just to fund affordable housing so -- Illustrates the point I'm I'm so glad you're here you might start is off with this man. Thank you. Good afternoon chairman and honorable members of the assembly my name is Gerry Glasser Hedrick and I'm the director of business and government affairs for the California housing finance agency. I thank you for allowing me to participate I'm here to talk a little bit about what Kelly to pay is doing in the mixed income and missing middle space -- I have a presentation here -- By way of background Kelly to phase serves as the state's affordable housing lender. And was created to develop public Berman and private capital investment. Investors to help increase and preserve affordable housing. College of a is self supported and does not rely on the general fund for its operations. Since its inception college of a has supported the production and preservation of multi family housing. As well as homeownership programs down payment and closing assistance programs. Special programs in concert with local governments. Ample cities and counties and also has -- Provided -- Veterans housing this scope in approach to a continuum of housing needs is addressed in caliphates mission which is to create. And finance progressive housing solutions so that more Californians have a place to call home -- As indicated what I'm here to talk to you about today. Is our mixed income program but before I get into the next income program I wanted to give you a little bit of history. Regarding how the funding came to fruition I'm to my knowledge this is the only state program and that is aimed at a continuum of housing affordability between thirty and a hundred and 20% area median income which I'll. Get to in a minute but as those of you in the room might recall to the the big year for housing in the state. I'm not only was a four billion dollar housing bond passed by both the legislature and the governor which was just -- Approved at the ballot in November and is going -- To go into went to a fact to and hopefully that -- Bond is going to recharge a lot of our gap financing programs at the state level but in addition to that large effort there was -- At at a bill that might have gotten a little bit less notoriety -- But might be very familiar with San Diegans because it was championed by and senator Atkins at the time -- But it was Senate bill two which created the building home and jobs act -- Which became effective in two thousand eighteen and what that did is create a permanent source for affordable housing throughout the state -- It's based on a seventy five dollar recreation fee -- That's recorded on certain real estate transactions those resources go into a pot of funds -- Which then is divided I'm Tina was Nguyen eight city and local jurisdictions in 20001915% of the proceeds. I'm which is approximated to be about thirty million dollars will come to cal HFA. On to develop a mixed income housing program. So that's essentially how we got to where we are today -- Our executive director T. about men Patterson is very interested in the concept of more integrated community is and the mix of incomes within projects which for those of you who are engaged in the portable housing. Community husband challenging because the tax credit program really focuses on or has in the past focused on income levels and 60% and below. And so there's been an absence of production of mixed income projects and have a units that are targeted above I'm sixty or Just because they've been really challenging to finance -- So -- For the last year Callie Jeff a has been out -- Talking to the development community out financing units outside of the tax credit round. Given the loss of both the tax credit financing and what is used to finance projects in California -- The welfare exemption which exams affordable housing projects from property taxes. I'm it's really challenging for developers to produce units outside of the tax credit program. And we heard a lot of this feedback from the development community. And so we we kind of came back with all that that that information. And we crafted a program to try to reflect the market conditions that exist in the community. And what we've done is we're trying to leverage our existing affordable housing programs through the bond and 4% tax arena -- And to try to leverage on the fact that -- The federal government approved new income averaging laws which allow projects -- To target unit 60% up 280% as long as I'm the average affordability is is 60%. And then also we're trying to provide incentives but not mandates that -- Developers included tron XIV units that go above her outside the tax credit -- Restrictions so that were really creating a continuum of housing with in projects with. Some units that will be targeted below sixty sixty eighty and then hopefully above eighty as well. I am we initially sent out a term sheet in late August this year we received a lot of feedback from the development community and we've been retooling our term sheet. Sense then -- But generally our program will be focused on new construction I think assembly member -- Gloria was was perceptive with regard to the fact that we're just not producing enough units in the state to keep pace with demand. And so -- There is a supply problem -- You know all others argue that there is there is a demand problem as well but but markedly we have just not been producing enough units to keep pace with with the need. I'm so this program husband I'm specifically designed as a new construction program. Their resources that college of Faye receives from -- The permanent so born and financing very similar to the way other -- Programs are structured at the state level and the unique thing about the program is that the resources will be able to be used on units that are restricted anywhere from thirty two hundred and 20% area median income -- And the resources -- Will be paired with a bond and or bond in tax credit project. But the number of tax credited units can be as little as 20% of the units on side so it could be a very -- It could be a partial tax credit and market rate development -- The units could also go up 281% we're trying to provide people a lot of flexibility. With regard to what they end up building but trying to pair it with existing -- Under utilized resources at the state level -- There are going to be -- To preferences -- In addition to some geographic and project type parameters that will govern the program -- We are gonna give priority to acts that -- Target at least 10% of their units to eighty one two hundred and 20% area median income. I'm it will be a requirement of the program but to the extent that a feasible option for people we want to try. To encourage people -- To target that level and we definitely heard the challenges in developing those sorts of units given the loss of tax credits in the welfare exception. But the development community is remarkably -- Creative and we're hopeful that they'll be some interesting ideas that they're able to bring to the table -- The other preference will be the lowest -- Subsidy request per unit. The idea here is to try to incentivize developers to leverage other resources to the greatest extent possible and to try to reduce costs as as much as possible -- In addition to those preferences we are trying to ensure that there is some. Geographical distribution of the projects and no one county will be able to receive more than fifteen million dollars of the subordinate financing. And we also want to ensure that we have more than one sponsor is able to benefit from the program. And so -- No one sponsor will be able to obtain more than ten million dollars of resources. In addition to that -- There will be -- Housing to family units -- targeted to projects will be a to projects that have at least -- than 40% of the resources. That are provided -- Through the program will be for senior projects there's been a lot of discussion about micro units -- I think especially in San Diego and college Ave is really open -- To the idea and the creativity that developers are harnessing with my car units but we still want to ensure that some of that units produced as a result of this program -- Are targeted for families -- The program will allow of forty thousand dollars per unit per restricted unit and so. It's not only the that are eight on the U. it's it's all of the all of the restricted units in the project we're hopeful that this makes the program attractive to developers. That have -- Potentially bond in tax credit deals -- In order to become feasible and they might convert them to meet this prototype and also bring. Potentially other projects into the mix that wouldn't have been feasible absent this money -- Into the mix the we will charge the percent simple interest for the resources -- So that is the general -- Kind of an overview of the program we are hopeful -- That the thirty to thirty five million dollars that we produce will result in -- You know seven to ten mixed income projects throughout the state it's not -- A significant amount of units but it is -- It is important and I think we will begin -- To create space within the mixed income missing middle I'm continue -- That we hope will will catch on the program roll out and is scheduled -- In mid January we will go to our board for approval in mid January and will roll out term sheets -- There after we will be is into put on February action. Solicit applications by the end of April. There was a slight -- Correction that I wanted to make or just I guess the difference with regard to our single family programs it was it was stated in the presentation before that the additional one point five million dollars of down payment assistance would -- Potentially SS -- Fifteen thousand homeowners and are that it will assist at up to twenty thousand I'm homeowner so with that -- All hands -- The Mike over to them part. Thank you bad thanks for being here. Questions first year what taken together okay. So my name's been work on with the California municipal finance authority it's a group most of you have never heard of but we are kh to a bond issuer. What that means is we just actors that we just issue the bonds we don't actually have money in the project -- The same FAA we do a bunch of other things besides affordable housing but at this point we've done about six billion dollars in affordable housing bonds -- That's been about four hundred twenty projects. Which it was about thirty five thousand units throughout the state -- Currently have worked in over four hundred cities and counties and states. Wanted citizen counties throughout the state -- Seem if a we also have a kind of a sister organization we do nation wide issuances. And I've worked in the state of Oregon since New Hampshire and Florida. Doing bond issuances in local jurisdictions there -- The reason I I say this is because I kind of I feel like I'm a macro perspective of affordable housing in the way things are done -- Not all. California but throughout the and then I've been able to see over the past couple years -- Other states. Operate and how they do their four wheel housing and it's been interesting to see the different programs and incentives that -- Other states offer is anyone been Cañada lately. I haven't either but apparently there's no homeless people there. So what why it why do they have no homeless in the we have LA were closing off entire city blocks for homeless people. You know or you look at New York wise the homeless population increasing rapidly in Boston homeless population. Decreasing wrapping. To so. Stop. To speak local instead as for producing that middle. Bracket -- Bowls of people that are really. In a tangible benefit there's not many there's not very many programs the California has to offer cities don't get some kinda. Extra bonus they don't get some kind of vouchers or anything like that because they produced. X. amount of homes it's 70% area median income -- But obviously there's a lot of intangible benefits diversifying housing the markets -- Surveying people that are underserved behaving being able to keep families in place. On keeping transportation costs down there's a bunch a macro economic. Statistics statistics you to look at for families that live within a certain. Area is a poster driving into those. Those areas so if you're looking at a map review affordable housing is actually very simple. To qualify for affordable housing project you need forty first you need to have 60%. Very median income and 40% of the units that were you do 50% area median income in 20% of the units. On a federal level that's it there's nothing else. In the state we have overlays upon overlays upon overlays of things that need to happen to be able. To issue the bonds for affordable housing before they so it's an interesting perspective if you go to Tennessee or go to Texas to get in for will housing you just go to the state treasures window say I want to affordable housing. They give you allocation. And there you go you're you're you're moving right along -- If you're in not the city but if you're in other cities it can be up to a year and a half right now just to get an inducement resolution. Which really starts the window of being able to capture those costs and bonds in your taxes are Bonta make your financing much cheaper. So we got a look at what what's hurting affordable housing and and what I've seen on the hundred plus housing bills I do a year [inaudible] Is. This nor trên obviously we lost already a we lost the gap financing were luckily getting some gap financing coming back. That's not going to cure the problem but one of the bigger problems that we've seen. Is construction costs in the delays and timing so projects going up so right now we're we're about 829% of our projects having to go back into said lack and receive supplemental allocation. Where they have to increase their barring amount? As a construction costs have gone up in the year that they decided to doing the project. We've done a lot of projects that sister projects. That within one year construction costs not locales gone up almost a 100%. And so really one of the driving factors I think to producing affordable housing. At the forty and 60% of them are -- Sorry 1650% in my in -- Those higher brackets is speeding up the process making things -- Much easier to do. And we are going to then a second -- But making the process much easier and to get construction part started because if you're adding an extra couple million dollars in the financing of borrowing to produce the same amount of units it's not doing. Anything for us. And that's really one of the biggest things we're looking at is a five ten years will ten years ago we're really looking at greening every affordable housing project there was they couldn't figure out. Why we ballooning three hundred twenty five thousand dollars per unit and now we're getting? Six fifty seven fifty San Francisco sitting a million dollars per affordable housing in it you're in riverside you're hitting five in a fifty thousand dollars per unit you can build a house. Interceptor five in a fifty thousand dollars but we're building a single unit an apartment complex. Some things don't make sense and so we really got a look at the fees. That are being charged we got a look at the overall construction overall costs it's not just a simple cost it's all the things that are added. And then the timing because the unfortunately the developers are competing its market rate guys. And they don't have to go through the entire process getting crushed it's taking year to get going on a project where mercury guys can get going right away. And in that time their construction sought throughout the state and it's getting hard to line up the the construction companies to get moving on the projects and so the the cost of the project -- On increasing. So one of the things to benefits or two two bright spots I see -- Unfortunately bonds are still a little bit behind on tax credits bonds. If you're. It 60% so you have one get 61% doesn't matter federal doesn't care. So that you don't get any extra benefit for doing for bringing in somebody at 61% -- For tax credits they've recently made some changes and now you can average incomes so we're hoping within this next let you what -- And federal legislation cycle the bonds may be able to catch up in your you can average income a lot more and I think that'll directly impact -- Whatever what's your for today's you can start adding since -- even higher. An average it down with some of the lower median incomes -- In with that that's I mean that's just kind of the map reviews of what I've seen. And we will be happy to take any questions it's awesome of thank you both for presenting -- Injury I'm sorry I think it's a bit stretching aim at the beginning. Above should happens a fair amount but I'm grateful that publicly all the effort you made to be here today. Up you know I think you the first panel did talk about Michael units -- Any mention an openness okay talk a little bit more about that that seem to get a better traction -- In in the early part of this hearing. Yeah I think that -- Micro units have been response in in somewhat to the increasing construction costs and just the changing demographics in urban areas. To try to address the housing needs -- I think that you know out I've spent most of my career in a kind of traditional bond in the in the traditional bond and tax credit world and there's there's very prescriptive. Especially in the 9% program kind of very prescriptive -- Criteria for projects and unit sizes -- Eight I think they front types is of house I think so. That we word word trusting market concerns -- And that the projects that are being constructed with subordinate financing are are consistent with with what is being produced by the market. So we're not producing markets are subsidizing Ana projects that are that are inconsistent with with what is going on in local markets but I think were definitely open -- And you know there's been a lot of discussion about -- Modular unit sand bringing in the kind of kid. Different sorts of storage containers -- Menu better man pre manufactured to decrease -- Construction times I'm so I think there's a lot of innovation going on in the kind of the bill environment associated with affordable housing which we want to be open -- To we just also want to be really cognitive that we we were we continue to serve -- Families and seniors given -- That they they are a large population of need it with in the group of individuals that. One of my that's a full here the the part of the previous conversation was -- And observation that these projects are are permissible under kind of existing codes -- But that the challenges been financing -- In some ways and the presentation of Doug still here -- Of trying to do with private financing for a variety of reasons -- But it at all knowledge meant or even an interest -- For public financing in the space -- Might be to the the last piece to actually get the doors open on the string. Bed you made mention of that for door costs -- Recognizing the part B. play this pick the role -- Eight any observations on jurisdictions are doing well and getting that number down or bringing it down. Well. If you're using. Fifties living where you can. You know look it's on for says there's a strong requires required. Where you're? One of the things was done as the title twenty four requirements that were put into place while ago really. Increase and things are coming down from there. But jurisdiction wise I think of a cost per door is that how quickly a financing can get done. And that's from the start of the financing to getting into said lack. To getting the bonds issued -- Take a year to go through that process. And it's because of all the checks and balances that been put into place -- A lot of its very redundant and there's a lot of you know some of the cities and counties just have. This is how it's done it's always been down that way and that's just how it's going to continue to be done. And it's just their own internal policies and procedures as opposed to what's really required on federal or state level to be able to qualify. So that time line if you can get to the dirt quicker it's obviously gonna bring down per door. And we've seen a working with a lot of cities and counties over the last little while. We've seen cities and counties -- At asks to come help them through the process [inaudible] Gone. Two dozen counties and they're getting the process is down. Procedures Donald a little bit so they can get into said lack and to teach các and to be able to have the bonds issued at a quicker pace. Interpreting question the purpose of this hearing is to tease out legislative ideas and concepts of between. Nineteen legislative year. In that sort -- Guidance that would be okay legislation that might prescribe a time line to get you to get two things we have. The bonds will be fixed and to kind of a long term. The construction cost seems to be one of the bigger problems I think the developers are. Are hitting right now and there's a lot of local requirements like I said I've worked in for her plus cities and counties. Throughout the state the require different things that. You would put on your own home yeah and it really drives up the cost per unit and they don't pencil. You know northern California just as an example because I can. Known for the California terms and but there's a lot of the the lot of the developers will add on every random -- Bonus they can get within like the celebrity school programs in a senior facility. Does make any sense but they want to score the Max amount of points and they they commit themselves themselves to different things or cities and counties will make them do different things after to the project. Which really costs a lot per unit. And so it's a matter of cities and counties looking through their affordable house requirements and saying do we want to build affordable housing projects. Or do we just kinda want to manager process ago is interpreting you saying was that there were -- Perhaps -- Public hearings or procedural votes a redundancy in that process that you're perhaps we could make clarify that those are necessary or or even actually counterproductive so there's a few federal once you have to do to be able to get your bonds unit of an inducement have to have a tougher. Yet of a final resolution -- Inducement resolutions you can show me clear this is since you're you're doing it able. Can capture any bond good. The bonds. There's a lot of cities and counties you work with to do the tough for her you know for helping them with their inducements -- It may take him three four months just to get going on an inducement an inducement is done by the city's -- Bond counselor that it's the bond counts the rights the let the resolution. In an inducement should really take more than two weeks for a total review I don't even know why would take two weeks from an application to review. As opposed -- To I'm doing it tough for right now on working with and do some processes hearings to do whatever. And so a tough for a firm this and now a tougher as mandated by -- Nineteen eighty four tax code essentially just says you have to have a fourteen day notice they've updated that's also hard notice. Any out of a public hearing that's it. If you're in Texas you can be five counties over within twenty five miles and the tempers good you don't even have to be when you're jurisdiction. So there's all these different things that we deal with tougher as to look one zero sum up they have a five step process were first they have a tougher hearing. And then they have a tougher monitoring and they have the actual hearing it city council in your to wait another two weeks to do the ratification and then two more weeks to get the numbers minutes before you get your actual approval. That that that adds months under project. Which doesn't do anything yeah. Interesting. That maybe some for follow. Up there with one of our time thank you are both -- For that -- Presentations -- Will transition to our final panel this afternoon thank you again -- Panel discussion so we'll probably have to have you come up here like the palaces to capture -- On the video and audio -- Our last panel -- Are two fine gentlemen I'm really good glad you both could be here. Today -- We'll start off with Steven Meisel who's exactly director of our very own standing housing federation. Do think so much for being here. Thank you some remember. You for the opportunity to be here will start with you they will go. To great. So -- Thank you my I am Steven Russell executive director of the San Diego housing federation and chairman Gloria thank you for the opportunity to be here -- Our vision at that send you housing federation -- Is that state or region is a thriving Ste was safe and stable place that we can afford to call home. And of course the reason is that a safe place to call home is the basis for all other successful outcomes in life -- Social medical educational vocational -- And also add a search in this would would say that the populations we primarily seek to serve -- Are -- Low income working families seniors veterans transition each use neighbors living with mental or physical disabilities and recently homeless individuals and permissible of housing we also work coalition with house California C. H. C.. And are sister organizations scamp -- NPH Kennedy commission C. C. R. H. and others -- When we talk about -- Housing and and even talking about middle income or moderate income housing it's important we accurately identify our housing production we we definitely have a good handle on the demand side. Of housing but not so much on the supply and when I talk about that is really -- Both production in existing supply. When I is this is a slight that I often uses for may be familiar to folks -- That we Chen. Housing production in the region from 200-032-2000 thirteen so in that decade this is segregated by -- That the categories the Reno looks at low as you can see according to this truck with over produced in the above moderate income bracket -- In in moderate income and low income we produce roughly a fifth of of the the demand over that period of time -- Fume important take was first of all. It's not exactly accurate we will narratively we know this is roughly true the at the data that is gathered about moderate income housing is not very consistent across the state. And that's that's a problem it's it's easier for a lot of municipalities merely claim above moderate housing rather than go through methodology to prove that they have produced moderate income housing. Please numbers very and I believe there seventeen jurisdictions in the state that go through a methodology to actually identify the moderate income production it's easier just to sweep it all up into the top. So that's there's a problem there in terms of actually knowing what we produced. It still the narrative is still roughly true though we we we believe that -- There is a lack of supply in a moderate income housing bracket and that it has disastrous effects on the lower income -- Because residents because those folks who are moderate income do not go without housing they make choices for housing that maybe. Sub optimum for them maybe a neighbor they don't want a smaller place apartment versus a home with moderate income households do not go without housing. Are they simply by up or rent up the housing that has been occupied by lower income. Individuals -- Next I think so what's important is also recognizing the differential impact the housing costs have a different income levels as I've just described -- And I'm gonna school through some of the income sites really quickly because the late hour but when you look at what 60% MI is and who that serve you can see that these are critical members of our community. When you look at what the wage went gap is we we look at -- The first two partial with what you need to for a one bedroom and what is needed to forty two bedroom and then you look at folks below 80% and mind what they're making. And you can see that there's a significant gap for us professions that are we consider middle class in any case as a legal secretary a police officer -- Nurse should all be obviously able to afford to live here. At about. AM my the gap less severe obviously honest. Which is a this. Are in this sort of ties into really a when a rental gap -- Affordability gap when you look at somebody police officers 60% a mind that is a starting salary -- Minus over time and you can see that even a police officers over paying five hundred and forty a month typically on average -- For a real local department the the apartment costs for market point realty advisors -- Is is obtained through October nineteen Tribune story you can see that. The gap is less severe as you move up the income scale there's no no surprises there with important quantify those things. Is important to note that we have both a supply problem and a use problem. And by that I mean not all the housing in the region's and this is a recent analysis that Sanday did the show the 5% of the entire market is off. Market -- And that includes a variety of things that include of vacation rentals vacation homes -- Impressive occasion rental short term vacation rentals rental homes -- In many cases cash depositories for foreign nationals were protecting assets in US denominated real estate US dollars -- With that's why we're producing hundred and 30% of the above moderate income housing is region's because we're serving and national and international market in that sector. But that's 5% is a crucial number because it is we we may work well recall 5% vacancy rate is considered a healthy vacancy rate in the region at which landlords and tenants have equal bargaining power. Weirdest two point 823% vacancy rate right now with which means it's total in the landlords favor and with 5% of the housing market pulled off if even half of that were actually potentially available for rental we could turn this into a renter's market just by making that housing available. This is the actual numbers that were produced mesa however stepped up blessed with on the sand. For producing these numbers reports -- What would we be looking forward -- To adequate site standards -- We should be requiring -- In with arena. Must identify there's land available but it doesn't actually have to be is on for housing when is included in our housing element has to be put the potential has to be there. But I think we might ask municipalities to half subject because that is how we're going to get to buy right development in these municipalities. We also need I think to increase our improve our data collection requirements -- Improve protocols by which we identify what price point a product is entering the market place. And also to better understand -- The loss of naturally affordable housing because we we talk a lot about expiring affordability and that refers only to that which is covenant at that which is supported by public subsidy. The vast majority of court in court affordable housing we have lost in the last decades has been naturally for the housing bid up. A rented up by middle income residents like look at north park in city heights of classic examples of this -- And I think it's it's would also the state would help was better identify when speculative pressures are driving up costs because even in the discussion about rent control the goal there is to is to remove speculation from the market place not to read not. To not to impair production and not to to degrade the housing spot but to take the speculative -- Interests -- To reduce those impacts on the actual price of housing is a number of ways that speculation comes in which is short term vacation rentals as one sure speculation were investors come and take an existing building. By for high price and rented up at a higher rate no new housing is being produced but the rents can sometimes go a 50% or more. Up it's worth pointing out what a type of data collection also some numbers been thrown around about housing production costs -- My look misinterpret recollections of the how for the past five years so that's below some of the the larger numbers -- I also know examples -- Interfaith housing I was St seniors was about two hundred and forty thousand a unit and the whole reason there was the land was banked. In these whistles bottle low price when we look at solutions land banking public land trust and other things of come earlier today certainly have some real value -- So another thing I would I would recommend that we do maybe it legislatively it's to look at some off market housing measures. Enabling legislation -- That would make it easier for municipality to control short term vacation rentals maybe provide bumper guard so that it's not a considered a taking but makes it easier because we all well know what happened locally. And it is a terrible problem and you see speculation going into that as well people over pay for properties because they can anticipate that they can use in the short term vacation rentals rather typical rental -- We also could be looking at second home mortgage interest deductions that was looked at previously as with financing -- You what what what we're doing is we are subsidizing people have to homes and our people right now who have none and I think we need to be looking at whether. The purpose of mortgage home interest deduction -- It inflates the cost of the stock and it it -- In incentivize people to on more housing than they actually use -- Finally I would say -- In conclusion the development of it at go to relieve the pressure on lower income households. At portions of this market are never going to function for all residents even in the moderate income you talk to developers how low could you actually bring the price. They struggle to so that they can bring something to the one twenty written. market forces all the deregulation in the world I'd love to solve that problem I believe it's going to take a public intervention funds or other special considerations. And if we do that we need to make sure that housing stays in that housing costs bracket that we don't simply put housing out there that is then flipped. And and rises to a two new higher level -- I with other things we could be doing is -- Local revenue sources we need local revenues as other regions have done. Apps lowering the threshold for housing bonds and expanding the breadth of application for those -- Better coordination transportation and land use of how we spent transportation dollars that in support of housing production. When since US and transmit three comes along let's require that these funds be spent things like that half road expansion Mister wearing was talking about could very well have been a regional cost that was born not something apply to the individual units -- And I do think that the creation funding of land trust could be critical if we create a land trust the you have to continue to feed it money to be able to grow its its mission. But it is a way of making sure the housing comes on the market below market. And stays there overtime others are a number of ideas we have. Time I will let. Find him. To be in. So my friend Helen I we California be where a new housing advocacy organization -- That advocates for state legislation to make California affordable and accessible -- For everyone -- Insuperable races but was like we believe that California's for everyone -- Whether a migrant from Ohio El Salvador or if your right here from San Diego -- We believe that everyone. Should be able to achieve their full potential -- Enjoy -- Quality schools access to good jobs in safe secure a formal housing -- Unfortunately as piping was -- Mentioned this sort of California dream has become a California nightmare for millions of us are for to many Californians are burdened with a very high rents that just keep on increasing -- And have no hope at achieving their dream of Californians cities have made it more costly time consuming. Difficult in a legal to build enough housing to keep up with population growth. During the nineteen sixties seventies and eighties Los Angeles for instance made it illegal to book apartment buildings and condos in most their neighborhoods including the neighborhoods where they had long been a permitted. The result is that LA zone capacity went from ten million it to three point nine million even as the population increased by 40%. Spiking rents rising homelessness and lower rates of homeownership were predicted and unfortunately all came to a fruition. So short when a crisis -- And in a crisis leaders need to take decisive action to solve the problem. So we need to be done well as several independent analysts have suggested we need to build three point five million homes within that. The next a decade in in order to do that the state legislature to pass a sweet a policy changes to get California Boeing again. First. The legislature must reverse the down zoning of the past in. Legalize apartment buildings and missing little housing areas well served by transit and jobs. The state should build on the success of a success rate one unit of legislation and help increase our construction throughout the state. Also known as easy use granny flats are cheaply built around as long as owners of regulations don't get in the way. The state must streamlined the production of housing that complies with the rules of local governments. Forty years ago the state passed the permit streamlining act. Yet permits or anything but streamlined -- It's long past time to close -- Those of the that the state must also curtail the ever increasing -- Fees that local governments and special used districts impose a new homebuilding as previous palace and mentioned we're taxing we most need new homes. Which ensures that -- Homes are only built at a time when prices are very high. At the state passed a bill called the mitigation fee after thirty years ago but it too is. Riddled with the house of the polls that and and the speed dressed -- And I just really want to hit on appointed early panelists made Benefit everyone. For everyone -- If if you think of that civilization is a worthy goal if you think that social democracy is a is a worthy goal than it's worth paying -- For you don't decades ago of former housing activists recognize that these impact fees reform exclusionary zoning. I challenge people to go back to the man that would like nineteen seventy one yellow review article that Paul Devon off road -- What the tiny of advocacy planning he's calling out -- It infrastructure fees on on homes as being exclusionary and locking out lower and middle income people because it does -- Does he like to really address the crisis. California needs to take a page from. The previous time in history with is a national emergency in over two and bill temporary workforce housing to house the carpenters labors and trades people that we will need. To build a California tomorrow -- We also need to dismantle local governments of the revenue at that they need to adequately address the needs of low income Californians. On twenty twenty there'll be a ballot initiative -- To eliminate property protections for many commercial properties this measure could race at six to ten billion dollars a year -- That's a lot of money and I am a huge proponent of it. And I also think to your point. That we need to take a look at the more at the state mortgage interest deduction -- It many studies have shown that it does not actually promote first time -- Homeownership the the tax savings is to capitalize into the cost of housing about making it a more expensive and the fact that we haven't second homes. Is just. The criminal. We need to hear that -- I but you know we spend billions of dollars every year on the MIT select. What would it just California budget look like I mean not in the pre it's of legislation -- And if we were really serious about -- And me and then the needs -- Of a Limón Californians than what we will be spending five billion dollars a year on the mortgage interest at a deduction -- And so I just close by saying that our our housing challenges
