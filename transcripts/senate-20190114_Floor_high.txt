I SHE IS RETIRING LATER THIS WEEK. CHANCES ARE THERE HAVE ONLY BEEN ONE PRINCIPLE COMMITTEE CONSULTANT. IN THE HISTORY OF THE SENATE. WHO ALSO HAD CAREERS AS A CONGRESSIONAL AIDE? A PROFESSIONALLY TRAINED PASTRY CHEF. AND A. C. I. A. ANALYST. THAT DISTINCTION BELONGS TO ERIN RYAN. WHOSE WINDING PATH OVER THE COURSE OF AN EXTRAORDINARY LIFE. BROUGHT HER NOT ONCE BUT TWICE TO OUR OWN INSURANCE COMMITTEE. I HAD THE PLEASURE OF GETTING T KNOW HER LAST YEAR. AS THE CHAIR OF THE PANEL. I'M SORRY TO SEE HER GO BECAUSE IN THE SHORT TIME WE HAVE WORKED TOGETHER. SHE ADDED A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT TO MY INSURANCE LAW I. Q.. BUT BEFORE SHE GOES I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT TO SHARE WITH YOU SOME OF THE HIGHLIGHTS OF AARON'S LIFE. HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND AROUND THE WORLD. THOSE WHO OF WORK WITH ERIN NO THAT SHE CAN BE A TENACIOUS ANALYSTS. GRABBING HOLD OF A PROBLEM AND REFUSING TO LET GO UNTIL SHE KNOWS IT AS WELL AS ANYONE. TO UNDERSTAND THAT TENACITY. IT HELPS TO KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT. HER FAMILY FROM WHERE SHE CAME AARON'S FATHER [inaudible] LEO RYAN. WAS A PROUD IRISH AMERICAN AND A CALIFORNIA ASSEMBLY MEMBER FROM SAN FRANCISCO FIRST ELECTED IN THE EARLY NINETEEN SIXTIES. HIS EARLY CAMPAIGN FEATURED APPEARANCES BY THE RYAN GIRLS. ERIN AND HER TWO SISTERS. WHO DRESSED IN GREEN AND ORANGE OUTFITS ON BY THEIR MOTHER? TO CELEBRATE THE FAMILY'S ETHNIC HERITAGE. NOW WE TALK A LOT ABOUT OVERSIGHT IN THE LEGISLATURE. BUT LEO RYAN DID MORE THAN TALK. HE WAS A BORN INVESTIGATOR. AFTER THE WATTS RIOT. RYAN WENT TO LOS ANGELES IN WORK AS A SUBSTITUTE TEACHER TO GET A FIRST HAND LOOK AT CONDITIONS IN THE AREA. LATER AS CHAIRMAN OF A COMMITTEE OVERSEEING PRISON REFORM. HE POSED AS A DEATH ROW INMATE AT FOLSOM PRISON. TO GATHER INFORMATION ON PRISON CONDITIONS FOR HIS COMMITTEE. AND AS MANY OF YOU KNOW. LEO RYAN'S LIFE ENDED TRAGICALLY. AMID YET ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THIS THERE IS FOR INFORMATION. THE LEE ALL SERVING IN CONGRESS AARON'S FATHER WAS ASSASSINATED. ON A SOUTH AMERICAN AIRSTRIP WHILE INVESTIGATING THE JOHNSTOWN ENCAMPMENTS. WHICH HOUSE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE DRAWN FROM HIS DISTRICT IN SAN FRANCISCO. TO JOIN A CULT KNOWN AS THE PEOPLE'S TEMPLE. ERIN WAS JUST TWENTY ONE WHEN HER FATHER WAS KILLED IS WORK AND HIS DEATH. WERE THE INSPIRATION FOR HER IN PUBLIC SERVICE. HE EARNED A BACHELOR OF SCIENCE IN FOREIGN SERVICE AT GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY. AND A LAW DEGREE FROM HASTINGS. HE THEN SERVED EIGHT YEARS AS AN INTELLIGENCE OFFICER IN THE CIA. FOR JOBS INCLUDED ADDING THE PRESIDENT'S DAILY BRIEF AND BRIEFING THE SECRETARY OF STATE AND THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE. HE LATER SPECIALIZED IN LATIN AMERICA AND AFRICAN ISSUES. SHE WAS THE PRIMARY AUTHOR OF THE NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE ESTIMATE ON SOUTH AFRICA. AT A TIME OF INTENSE DEBATE AND UNREST AT THE END OF THE APARTHEID ERA. BUT THIS WORK TOOK ITS TOLL. AND AARON NEEDED A BREAK. SO SHE PACKED HER BAGS FOR NEW YORK IN PURSUIT ANOTHER PASSION FOR ANOTHER KIND OF SERVICE WITH THE DIFFERENT. CIA THE CIA WAS THE CULINARY INSTITUTE OF AMERICA. AND IN HIGH PARK WHERE SHE ATTENDED THE THEIR INSTITUTE A SHE GOT A GREAT EDUCATION RETURN TO CALIFORNIA'S A PASTRY CHEF. IN SAN MATEO COUNTY IN SACRAMENTO INCLUDING AT THE HYATT REGENCY ACROSS THE STREET FROM THE CAPITOL. BUT AFTER LEARNING HOW TO MAKE PASTRY WITH THE BEST OF THEM. ERIN DECIDED TO SEE HOW THE LEGISLATIVE SAUSAGE WAS MADE. THAT'S WHAT SHE CROSSED THE STREET TO JOIN THE STAFF OF SENATOR JACKIE SPEAR. JACKIE HAD WORKED FOR LEO RYAN AS MANY OF YOU NOW. WAS SHOT FIVE TIMES AND LEFT FOR DEAD IN THE SAME AMBUSH THAT KILLED AARON'S FATHER. JACKIE AND ERIN'S FAMILY HAD DEEP TIES SO IT WAS A PERFECT MATCH OF SENATOR AND STAFF. AARON SERVICE JACKIE'S LEGISLATIVE AIDE IN LATE LATER AS A CONSULTANT. TO THE BANKING FINANCE INSURANCE COMMITTEE HE ROSE TO BECOME PRINCIPAL CONSULTANT UNDER CHAIRMAN MIKE MACHADO. HE THEN FOLLOWED SENATOR SPEAR TO WASHINGTON. AFTER SEVERE WAS ELECTED TO CONGRESS AMONG OTHER ISSUES ERIN PLAYED A KEY ROLE IN REPRESENTING JACQUI ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. AND THE DODD FRANK LAW THAT REFORM THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY AFTER THE HOUSING CRASH IN. TWO THOUSAND EIGHT THE JACQUI WANTED TO BE HERE TODAY. BUT SHE COULD NOT BE ABSENT FROM HER DUTIES IN WASHINGTON. HE SENT ME A NOTE DESCRIBING ERA HAS QUOTE ONE OF THE SMARTEST. MOST DEDICATED AND RESOURCEFUL PUBLIC SERVANTS SHE'S EVER MET. ERIN SHE SAID WAS A REMARKABLY TALENTED LEADER AND WE KNOW THAT. IT WAS A STAND OUT IN EVERYTHING THAT SHE TOUCH. AFTER FIVE YEARS IN WASHINGTON ERIN'S LOVE FOR CALIFORNIA ONCE AGAIN TO HER BACK TO THE STATE. THIS TIME TO COMPLETE CAREER. SINCE TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN ERRANT'S BEEN A PRINCIPAL CONSOLE INSURANCE COMMITTEE. IN OUR WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE ERIN'S HOW HELP CRAFT LEGISLATIVE COMPROMISES. TO PRESERVE THE CALIFORNIA EARTHQUAKE AUTHORITY. STAFF HEARINGS ON CATASTROPHIC THREATS FACING CALIFORNIA FROM CLIMATE CHANGE DROUGHT AN EARTHQUAKE. ERIN IS A CONSUMER AND PROFESSIONAL DEDICATED TO HER WORK TO THE SENATE AND TO THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. BUT SHE ALSO KNOWS HOW TO ENJOY YOURSELF AND SHE HAS A LOVE FOR TRAVEL FINE WINE AND HORSES. I WISH YOU THE BEST A SHE LEAVES THE SENATE TEAM AND TRADES LATE NIGHT AT WORK FOR A CHANCE TO RIDE LITERALLY. INTO THE SUNSET [inaudible] CONGRATULATIONS [inaudible] I WARNED. MARTY THANK YOU. MEMBERS I REYES TO TEACH ME ALSO RATE IS WE HAVE TO BE RECOGNIZED BY THAT I'M READING OF THE STORY CENTER RUBIO. THANK YOU UP MEMBERS I RISE TO ALSO RECOGNIZE HER I'VE ONLY HAVE THE REASON PLEASURE OF KNOWING AARON BUT IT DOESN'T TAKE MUCH. TO RECOGNIZE HER PROFESSIONALISM COMPETENCE AND PASSIONATE FOR CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS SHE HAS A DEEP RESPECT FOR THE SENATE THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS AND STUFF. THAT RESPECT IS ME TOO I LIKE TO SHOW A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT WERE SHARED WITH ME BY OTHER PEOPLE. AT CENTER GLAZER MENTIONED ALREADY MANY WHO KNOW HER ARE IMPRESSED WITH THE BREADTH OF HER BACKGROUND NOTING THAT SHE GRADUATED FROM TWO CIA'S AS HE MENTIONED EARLIER. THE CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY IN CULINARY INSTITUTE FOR THE ARTS THIS ELECTRIC BACKGROUND HELPS TO EXPLAIN HOW SHE BECAME SO PERSISTENT. KNOWLEDGEABLE AND GENEROUS ONE OF OUR FORMER SENATE COWORKERS ONCE HOUSE IF SHE HAD A FUN MEMORY WHEN SHE WORKED IN THE CIA. SHE REMARKED THAT DURING HER TRAINING SHE ENJOYED. WHO CAN SAY THAT BUT WHILE FEW PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT HER TIME PROTECTING THE COUNTRY FAR MORE HAVE TASTED HER ACCOMPLISHMENTS AS A PASTRY CHEF? WHEN AARON FIRST JOINED THE SENATE ONE OF HER COLLEAGUES WOULD CAUTION ALL THE LOBBYISTS AND ANYBODY THAT WOULD COME CLOSE TO HER THERE'S TWO THINGS YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND ABOUT AARON? FIRST SHE'S SMARTER THAN YOU AND SECOND SHE'S WEAPON TRAINED. DURING THOSE YEARS SHE FOUGHT TIRELESSLY TO IMPROVE THE LIVES OF EARTHQUAKE AND FIRE VICTIMS AS WELL AS IMPROVE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS FOR LIFE INSURANCE PRODUCTS ESPECIALLY THOSE SOLD TO SENIORS. ALTHOUGH SHE'S MOVING ON WE WILL-BUILD ON ERRANT'S EFFORTS THIS YEAR AND THE YEARS TO COME AND BELIEVE ME I TRIED VERY HARD TO CONVINCE HER TO STAY WHEN WE HAD OUR LITTLE SIT DOWN. I AM SORRY AGAIN TO SEE HER GOAL BUT WE ALL WISH YOU'RE VERY WELL THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE ERIN. THANK YOU SENATOR RUBIO AND AGAIN A WARM. AND WELL DESERVED RETIREMENT SENATOR ROTH ON THIS.

I'M NOT GONNA REPEAT THE WELL DESERVED ACCOLADES OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE SPOKEN OF AND THEY ARE EXTRAORDINARILY WELL DESERVED -- BUT I WILL SAY THAT -- AS A STAFFER MYSELF FOR MOST OF MY THIRTY TWO YEARS IN THE AIRFORCE AND HAVING SERVED AS A COMMITTEE CHAIR OR SUB COMMITTEE CHAIR ON ONE COMMITTEE OR ANOTHER AROUND HERE FOR NOW GOING ON WHAT WILLBE. SOON SEVEN YEARS I THINK I KNOW WHAT A GREAT STAFF LEADER LOOKS LIKE. AN I CAN SAY THAT AARON IS ONE OF THE BEST IF NOT THE BEST. STAFF LEADER THAT I HAVE EVER HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF WORKING WITH AND FOR ACTUALLY. IN OR OUT OF THE MILITARY. AND YES I HAVE TRIED THE PASTRIES. NO KNOW TEARS IN THE SENATE. NOW - AARON YOU'LL REMEMBER THIS FROM YOUR FEDERAL SERVICE BUT SENIOR MILITARY OFFICERS HAVE A UNIQUE WAY. HAVE HAD AND CONTINUE TO HAVE A UNIQUE WAY OF RECOGNIZING SUPERIOR PERFORMANCE. IT IS THROUGH THE PRESENTATION OF SOMETHING IN A MILITARY WE CALL A CHALLENGE ACCORDING. AND SO ERIN. I'M GONNA PRESENT YOU WITH MY CHARGE GOING AND TELL YOU HOW MUCH WE'RE GONNA MISS YOU. I THANK YOU SIR ARE. IN [inaudible] WARMEST REGARDS. PERHAPS THE SENATE NEED TO SHIP SENATOR MORNING. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT.

ONE IN A IN A HOME THAT WAS INCINERATED ALONG WITH THE OCCUPANT THERE IS NO WAY TO DETERMINE. IF HE HAD LIFE INSURANCE FOR FIRE INSURANCE BECAUSE EVERYTHING WAS BURNED. AND THE CONSTITUENTS HAD DIRECT TO EVERY INSURANCE COMPANY IN CALIFORNIA. TO SEE IF THEY HAD A RECORD FROM THIS PERSON. AND WE WORKED WITH THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER IN THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY TO TRY TO THREAD THIS NEEDLE BUT IT WAS AARON WHO CAME UP WITH THE PLAN THAT ALLOWS A SIMPLE. ELECTRONIC ALERTING ANYONE LICENSED IN CALIFORNIA THEY NOW HAVE TO RESPOND TO THAT QUESTION IF THEY HAVE A POLICY IN THE NAME. OF THE DECEASED WHO LOVED ONES HAD NO WAY OF GETTING THAT INFORMATION SO THAT'S JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF AARON'S CREATIVITY AND PROBLEM SOLVING. BUT AS A FRIEND THERE AND WE'RE GONNA MISS YOU -- IN ADDITION TO THE WORK YOU ARE ALSO REALLY FUN TO HANG OUT WITH SO ALL THE BEST TO YOU IN YOUR NEXT COOKING CAREER. THANK YOU SENATOR MONEY. SENATOR GLAZER. AND T CONCLUDE THAT MADAM PRESIDENT TO HONOR AND RECOGNIZE AND THANK YOUR AND WE'RE HAVING A RECEPTION FOR HER ROOM IN ROOM.

IT'S THANK YOU A COLLEAGUE SO I STAND TO CHURN IN THE OF A AN EXTRAORDINARY. LEADER. OF A WOMAN WHO REALLY WAS CALLED THE GODMOTHER OF TITLE. NINE HER NAME WAS DOCTOR BERNICE SANDLER BETTER KNOWN AS BUNNY SAMPLER. SHE DIED AT THE AGE OF NINETY AND LIVED IN EXTRAORDINARY LIFE WHICH I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE BRIEFLY WITH YOU AS WE CONTINUE TO FIGHT. FOR EQUALITY OF OPPORTUNITY. BACK IN THE THIRTIES AND FORTIES WHEN SHE WAS A SCHOOL GIRL. SHE WAS ANNOYED AND THAT'S PROBABLY NOT HER WORD BUT SHE WAS ANNOYED THAT SHE WASN'T ALLOWED TO DO THINGS THAT THE BOYS WERE ALLOWED TO DO LIKE BE A CROSSING GUARD. OR OPERATE THE SLIDE PROJECTOR. SHE WAS A GIRL AND SHE WASN'T ALLOWED TO DO THAT DON'T ASK ME WHY GIRLS COULDN'T DO THOSE THINGS BUT THEY WERE NOT ALLOWED TO DO SO. SHE DID GO ON HOWEVER. TO GET HER DEGREE IN PSYCHOLOGY FROM BROOKLYN COLLEGE IN NINETEEN FORTY EIGHT HER MASTER'S IN PSYCHOLOGY. FROM CC AND WHY. SHE GOT A DOCTORATE IN EDUCATION IN. NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT NOW SHE EXPERIENCE BETWEEN THE TIME SHE GOT HER MASTER'S AND WENT ON FOR DOCTOR. SHE XPERIENCED HER SELF THE DISCRIMINATION AS YOUNG ACADEMIC IN THE SIXTY SHE WAS TOLD BY UNIVERSITY DEANS THAT SHE WAS PASSED OVER FOR TEACHING POSITIONS. BECAUSE SHE QUOTE CAME ON TOO STRONG FOR A WOMAN. I'M LOOKING AROUND THIS ROOM HERE. AND THAT MAY HAVE APPLIED TO ALL OF US HERE. OF OUR GENDER. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN TO BE TOO STRONG FOR WOMAN? WELL. SHE WAS VERY VERY ANNOYED BY THAT. THE ACT A SUGGESTION. AND OUR CLAIMS THAT SHE WENT HOME AND CRIED. BUT SHE GATHERED UP HER COURAGE SHE DID SOME READING AND DISCOVERED THAT. THERE WAS A LITTLE KNOWN CLAUSE IN AN EXECUTIVE ORDER. THE PROHIBITED AMONG OTHER TYPES OF DISCRIMINATION. DISCRIMINATION BASED ON GENDER IN AWARDING FEDERAL CONTRACTS. THAT HAD BEEN -- PUT INTO AN EXECUTIVE ORDER BY THEN PRESIDENT LYNDON BAINES JOHNSON. WELL THAT WAS HER EUREKA MOMENT. SHE WAS NOT TRAINED IN THE LAW OR LEGISLATIVE PRACTICE BUT SHE USED THE FEDERAL ORDER TO FILE ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS IN OVER TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY CASES. AGAINST THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ACTIONS WHICH LED TO THE EVENTUAL CRAFTING OF TITLE. NINE NOW SHE RECEIVED MULTIPLE AWARDS DURING HER LIFE DOZENS OF HONORARY DEGREES AND WAS INDUCTED INTO THE NATIONAL WOMEN'S HALL OF FAME IN. TWENTY THIRTEEN BUT OF THE MANY STORIES THAT I'VE READ ABOUT BUNNY. MY FAVORITE IS THE ONE WHERE THE COST MOST CLUBS IN WASHINGTON DC DIDN'T ALLOW WOMEN UNTIL NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT AND IF YOU WERE. GOING TO BE ASKED TO SPEAK THERE YOU AS A WOMAN W'RE SUPPOSED TO GO IN THE BACK DOOR. WHICH SHE REFUSED TO DO. AND BECAUSE SHE WAS SO ANNOYED BY THIS SHE CARRIED WITH HER DOZENS OF OF THE STICKERS THAT SAID UPPITY WOMEN UNITE. AND ONE OF THE WAITERS AT THE COSMOS CLUB HE ASKED HER FOR HANDFUL OF THEM WHICH HE THEN DISPLAYED IN THE URINALS IN THE MEN'S ROOM. MUCH TO THEIR CONSTERNATION BUT TO HER PLEASURE. AND TO OUR PLEASURE I SUSPECT THE WORD WAS OUT. SO I SAY IN THE FORTY SEVEN YEARS SINCE TITLE NINE WAS AND ENACTED EVERY WOMAN IS GOING TO COLLEGE GOTTEN A LAW DEGREE OR A MEDICAL DEGREE. OR WAS ABLE TO TAKE -- SHOP INSTEAD OF HOME ECONOMICS. OWES DOCTOR SANDLER GREAT DEBT. TO GENERATIONS NOW OF WOMEN DOCTORS LAWYERS AND ATHLETES CAN LOOK AT HER WORK TO FOR EXAMPLE TO HER INTELLECT TO HER DETERMINATION. TO HER BEING ANNOYED BY NOT BEING ABLE TO OPERATE THE SLIDE PROJECTOR BACK IN THE THIRTIES AND FORTIES. SHE WAS INDEED THE START OF IT ALL SHE SPENT DECADES OF OUR LIFE IN THE FIGHT FOR WOMEN TO BE SEEN AS EQUALS AND TO BE JUDGED NOT ON THE BASIS OF THEIR SEX. BUT ON THE CONTENT OF THEIR CHARACTER. THANK YOU DOCTOR BERNIE SANDLER FOR A LIFE WELL LIVED FOR HELPING SO MANY OF US AS WE HAVE A TRIED TO NAVIGATE AND FIGHT FOR EQUALITY FOR OURSELVES AND OUR DAUGHTERS AND OUR SISTERS.
