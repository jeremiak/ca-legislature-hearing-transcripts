MY PARENTS ARE ACTIVISTS TO THEIR CORE. FIERCE FORCES FOR FAIRNESS AND HER FIGHT FOR JUSTICE HAS BEEN HARDWIRED INTO WHO I AM. AFTER BLOODY SUNDAY MY DAD HEADED TO SELMA ALABAMA AS A COLLEGE STUDENT TO STAND WITH MARTIN LUTHER KING JUNIOR. AND ORGANIZE FOR VOTING RIGHTS AND FOR CIVIL RIGHTS. AS A YOUNG FAMILY MOVED TO LET US THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE UNITED FARM WORKERS OF AMERICA MOVEMENT. IN THE TAXI MOUNTAINS OUTSIDE OF BAKERSFIELD. MY PARENTS HAVE BEEN RECRUITED TO HELP FILIPINO. LATINO FARMWORKERS ADVOCATE FOR BETTER WAGES AND WORKING CONDITIONS AND THEY WORK ALONGSIDE DOLLARS WHERE TAXES ARE CHAVEZ AND PHILIP VERACRUZ. MOST OF ALL WHAT IS STUCK WITH ME. ARE THE LESSONS ABOUT THE QUALITY THAT LA PAZ TAUGHT ME. IN THE PAST IT DIDN'T MATTER AFTER DALLAS AS A CHAVEZ. OR MIGRANT WORKER. IT DIDN'T MATTER IF YOUR FILIPINO. CHANNEL BLACK. OR WHITE EVERYONE THOUGHT AND JUSTICE IN THE WORLD. AND WANTED TO FIX IT. I FAMILY LAUGH APARTMENT WAS TIME FOR MY BROTHER NEED TO START SCHOOL. BUT THOSE EARLY LESSONS WITH DON. THAT AND INJUSTICE AGAINST ONE. IS AN INJUSTICE AGAINST ALL. THAT'S WHY I DECIDED TO BECOME AN ATTORNEY. TO FIGHT FOR THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN WRONGED. WE'RE SCARED WE'RE HURT. WERE MISTREATED. AND NEEDED SOMEONE TO FIGHT FOR THEM. AND IT'S NOT FIGHT FOR JUSTICE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS THAT MOTIVATES ME TODAY. AFTER GRADUATING FROM LAW SCHOOL AND SPENDING A SHORT TIME AND PRACTICE. I DECIDED TO PRACTICE FOR THE PEOPLE FULL TIME. JOINING THE SAN FRANCISCO CITY ATTORNEY'S OFFICE. AS A DEPUTY CITY ATTORNEY. I DID THAT FOR NEARLY A DECADE BEFORE ULTIMATELY JOINING YOU ALL IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE. FOR THE PAST EIGHT PLUS YEARS I'VE BEEN EXCITED TO WAKE UP EVERY DAY AND HIT THE GROUND RUNNING. WORKING FOR THE PEOPLE OF THIS GREAT STATE. IN THIS LIKE IN THIS LEGISLATURE. I'VE BEEN PROUD TO PARTNER WITH EACH OF YOU. TO PASS A NUMBER OF MAJOR REFORMS. AND TO RIGHT HISTORIC WRONGS. TO REPAIR OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. TO TAKE ON BIG POLLUTERS. AND PROTECT RENTERS. HOMEOWNERS CONSUMERS AND WORKERS. NUMBER TWO I'M PARTICULARLY PROUD OF THE WORK WE'VE DONE AND CONTINUE TO DO. TO COMBAT HATRED AND HELP VICTIMS OF HATE CRIME SO IMPORTANT TODAY. NOW MORE THAN EVER WE NEED LEADERS WHO WILL BUILD BRIDGES WITH THOSE WHO BEEN PERSECUTED. OTHER AND TARGETED. THAT WOULD BE ONE OF MY FIRST PRIORITIES ATTORNEY GENERAL FOR THE HONOR TO BE CONFIRMED. TO ENSURE THAT THOSE WHO ARE TARGETED BY THE FORCES OF HATE. ARE PROTECTED. AND THAT THOSE WHO USE HATE VIOLENCE. ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. STRENGTHENING OUR DEFENSES AGAINST HATE. IS NOT THE ONLY PROBLEM WE FACE. THERE ARE STILL TOO MANY WHO ARE WRONG IN CALIFORNIA. TOO MANY TO BECOME VICTIMS OF TRAFFICKING ABUSE. AND MISTREATMENT. TOO MANY WHO ARE TREATED UNFAIRLY BY THE MANY BROKEN PARTS. OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. AND DESERVE MORE JUSTICE. MORE HUMANITY AND A SECOND CHANCE. TOO MANY HAVE BEEN CHEATED BY BIG CORPORATIONS OR LIED TO. AS PART OF AN ORGANIZED SCAM. OR FRAUD. AS ATTORNEY GENERAL. THESE FIGHTS CALIFORNIANS FIGHTS WILL BE MY FIGHTS. I KNOW THERE ARE A NUMBER OF CHALLENGING CHALLENGES FACING THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE BUT I'M ALSO KEENLY AWARE OF THE DEDICATION OF THE CAREER STAFF AND THE TREMENDOUS WORK THAT IS DONE. BY THE DEPARTMENT EVERYDAY. THESE ARE SOME OF THE BRIGHTEST LEGAL MINDS IN CALIFORNIA WORKING INCREDIBLY HARD. EVERY DAY. TO PROTECT OUR FAMILIES. CALIFORNIA DOJ MUST BE AN ORGANIZATION THAT USES MORE JUSTICE MORE HUMANITY. MORE FAIRNESS AND MORE SAFETY. INTO OUR INSTITUTIONS. HAVE TO INFER I HOPE TO FURTHER ADVANCE THOSE EFFORTS AND SOLIDIFIED THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE'S REPUTATION. AS A NATIONAL VANGUARD REFORM. WITH THAT I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR QUESTIONS IN OUR CONVERSATION. THE AB SO WHAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE OW IS A SERIES OF INDIVIDUALS EVER RESPOND TO THE EIGHT TO SEE- TOPICS THAT I MENTIONED EARLIER- YOUR PERSPECTIVES ON WHAT YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES SHOULD BE ON AS A NEXT ATTORNEY GENERAL AND IMMEDIATELY AFTER THAT WE HAVE PUBLIC COMMENT. SO WE WILL BEGIN ON ITEM A PUBLIC DEFENDER. MANOHAR RAJU SAN FRANCISCO PUBLIC DEFENDED- OPERATOR. COULD YOU BRING IN THE SAN FRANCISCO PUBLIC DEFENDER. AND ALSO WE ALSO MADE ATTEMPTS TO ASK. DIFFERENT PEOPLE COMING FROM BOTH SIDES OF AN ISSUE SOME DECLINE MOST DECLINE AND SO THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT WANTED TO RESPOND BUT WE DID MAKE AN EFFORT. TO BE ABLE TO HEAR BOTH SIDES OF AN ISSUE. GOOD AFTERNOON CAN YOU HEAR ME. YES WE CAN GO AHEAD OKAY GOOD AFTERNOON HONORABLE SEVEN MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE A PART OF THIS CONVERSATION MY NAME IS BUT- RAJU AND I'M DELIGHTED PUBLIC DEFENDER A SEPARATE CISCO. I'M HONORED TO REPRESENT THE CRIMINAL DEFENSE COMMUNITY AND THE MOVEMENT FOR TRUE AND TRANSFORMATIVE JUSTICE IN CALIFORNIA. I WANT TO BEGIN TODAY WITH THE GUILTY VERDICT. RETURNED BY THE JURY THE DIRECTIONAL CONTROL YESTERDAY. TO BE CLEAR THE JURY REACHED THE RIGHT DECISION. BUT AS OTHERS HAVE SAID. THIS ISN'T JUST THIS. JEFF THIS IS GEORGE FLOYD BEING ALIVE TODAY. JUSTICE IS ENDING POLICE VIOLENCE AGAINST BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES. JEFF THIS IS DIVERTING RESOURCES FROM POLICE TO PROGRAMS THAT WILL HELP THOSE COMMUNITIES DEPRIVED. A GUILTYVERDICT HERE PROVIDE SOME MEASURE OFACCOUNTABILITY BUT IT IS FAR SHORT OF JUSTICE. IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THIS OUTCOME WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE IT KEEPS ALISON THE ATTORNEY GENERAL MINNESOTA NOT STEPPED IN TO HANDLE THE CASE. SIMPLY PUT IF THIS PROSECUTION HAD BEEN BUT TO LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT DIRECTION OF AND LIKELY WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN CONVICTED. IN THE PAST YEARS OUR COUNTRY HAS AWAKENED TO THE FREQUENCY AND BRUTALITY OF POLICE VIOLENCE AND JUST THIS WEEK WE STATED AGAIN. THE KIA BRYANT KILLED BY POLICE JUST AFTER THE SHOWN VERDICT WAS ANNOUNCED. AND MARIO GONZALEZ KILLED MONDAY DURING A WORK IN A REST BY THE ALAMEDA POLICE DEPARTMENT. AND AGAIN WE WONDER. WE KNOW THE TRUTH OF WHAT HAPPENED. IF THE VERIFICATION REVEALS WRONGDOING WILL IT BE SWEPT UNDER THE RUG. OR WILL IT BE BROUGHT TO LIGHT. IT'S CRUCIALLY IMPORTANT AT LAW ENFORCEMENT ACCOUNTABILITY BE A TOP PRIORITY OF THE NEXT ATTORNEY GENERAL. THIS RESPONSIBILITY ALSO EXTENDS BEYOND THESE MOST EXTREME CIRCUMSTANCES IN INTO ROOTING OUT RACIST BIASED AND BISLETT SUBCULTURES WITHIN THE RANKS. IT IS NOT JUST IMPORTANT THAT THE NEXT ATTORNEY GENERAL STEP UP ON LAW ENFORCEMENT ACCOUNTABILITY ISSUES. THEY MUST ALSO STEP DOWN WHEN PUSH TO DEPEND ON JUST AN INMATE POLICIES AND PRACTICES ON BEHALF OF THE STATE AND LOCAL PROSECUTORS. HISTORICALLY CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL'S A BIGGER SAY CONSISTENTLY FOUGHT AGAINST THE APPEALS AND PETITIONS OF INCARCERATED PEOPLE CHALLENGING WRONGFUL CONVICTIONS OR ANY MADE PRISON CONDITIONS. THIS INCLUDES THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL'S CONTINUED DEFENSE OF EVERY DEATH SENTENCE. REFUSAL TO ACKNOWLEDGE STRONG INNOCENCE CLAIMS RACIAL BIAS IN THESE DECISIONS OR THE FACT THAT MANY PEOPLE ON DEATH ROW SUFFER FROM MENTAL ILLNESS IT INCLUDES THE WAY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE'S DEFENDED THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION TO ACTION. WHICH CONTRIBUTED TO THE DEATHS OF TWO HUNDRED TWENTY ONE PEOPLE IN CDCR CUSTODY SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC. THE PHYSICIANS IN THE VACATION RELATED TO CRIMINAL APPEALS THE DEATH PENALTYPRISON CONDITIONS AND MORE ARE IN THE HUBEYSAN. THERE SHAMEFUL. WE BELIEVE IT IS POSSIBLE FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE TO FULFILL ITS OBLIGATION TO REPRESENT THE STATE NEEDS ACCESS WITHOUT FURTHER DEGRADING THE HUMAN BEINGS AT THE CENTRE OF THE ISSUE AND WE CALL UPON THE NEXT ATTORNEY GENERAL. TO MAKE IT SO. FINALLY I WANT TO KNOW A FEW OTHER THINGS THAT WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE NEXT ATTORNEY GENERAL TAKING A KEY LEADERSHIP ROLE ON. CLEAN STATE EFFORTS. THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE HAS THE MOST POWER AND RESPONSIBILITY FOR MAINTAINING AND EXPUNGING CRIMINAL RECORDS. CALIFORNIA IS READY FOR A NEW MORE EFFICIENT EFFECTIVE AND FAIR APPROACH. WE URGE THE NEXT ATTORNEY GENERAL. ROLE TO TAKE A STRONG POSITION REGARDING ENDING THE PRACTICE OF TURNING PEOPLE OVER TO ICE. AFTER THEY'VE EARNED THEIR RELEASED FROM JAIL AND PRISON. IF CONFIRMED WE LOOK FORWARD TO ATTORNEY GENERAL BOTTAS CONTINUED LEADERSHIP AT THE INTERSECTION OF THE CRIMINAL LEGAL SYSTEM AND PRIVATE INDUSTRY BY ENSURING THAT RE ELIMINATE THE PREDATORY BAIL BONDS INDUSTRY. AND CONTINUE TO MOVE AWAY FROM USING PRIVATE PRISONS AND DETENTION CENTERS. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO HIS CONTINUED LEADERSHIP AND TAKING POWERFUL AND REFRESHING STANCES REGARDING VIOLENCE AGAINST THE ASIAN. THE PACIFIC ISLANDER COMMUNITY AND OTHERS BY RECOGNIZING THE PUNISHMENT IS NOT THE ONLY POSSIBLE TOOL AND OFTEN NOT THE BEST SOLUTION. TO THESE PROBLEMS. THIS IS A UNIQUE MOMENT IN THE HISTORY OF OUR STATE AND COUNTRY. PEOPLE ARE READY FOR TRUE CHANGE IN THE CORAL ECOSYSTEM IN A WAY THAT WE HAVEN'T SEEN BEFORE. IF CONFIRMED ATTORNEY GENERAL BONTA HAS AN INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY TO SEIZE THAT MOMENTUM MOMENTUM GENERATED BY COMMUNITIES IMPACTED BY THE SYSTEM AND THEIR ALLIES TO TRULY TRULY AND MEANINGFULLY ADDRESSED THE SYSTEM'S FAILURES. TO PROMOTE TO JUSTICE CREW CUT ABILITY TO PUBLIC SAFETY HEALTH AND HEALING. I ALONG WITH MY OFFICE WILL BE HERE TO SUPPORT HIM IN THESE EFFORTS AND TO HELP KEEP HIM ACCOUNTABLE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

THE CURRENT ATTORNEY GENERAL AIRPORT ANNOUNCED LAST YEAR. THAT NEVADA HAD ELIMINATED THEIR BACK LOT. THE ILLINOIS ATTORNEY GENERAL LISA MADIGAN BUT IT EFFORT TO PASS A LAW REQUIRING LAW ENFORCEMENT TO ADOPT EVIDENCE BASED. TRAUMA INFORMED POLICIES. AND REQUIRED SPECIALIZED TECHNICAL TRAINING FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES ACROSS THE STATE. THE ENTUCKY ATTORNEY GENERAL CREATED A NEW UNIT AND HIS OFFICE TO INVESTIGATE AND PROSECUTE SEXUAL FELT COLD CASES. AND AT THE ATTORNEY. GENERAL FOR OHIO CREATED A SIMILAR UNIT. I REGRET AND EFFECTIVE RESPONSE TO SUCH A LOT OF THE HUGE LEFT IT WILL TAKE STRONG LEADERSHIP COMMITMENT AND INVESTMENT BY THE STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL. JOYFUL HEART STRONGLY RECOMMENDS THAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AT THAT IS A NEAT UNIQUE PROPOSITION RESPONSIBLE FOR OVERSEEING AND ENFORCING COMPLIANCE. WITH EXISTING SEXUAL ASSAULT POLICIES. SO THAT THINGS LIKE A STATEWIDE AUDIT ARE BEAUTIFUL OPTIONAL. ADDITION THAT WOULD SEE THE LARGER PICTURE SUGGESTS INNOVATIVE CHANGES. THE POSITION WOULD CREATE A POINT PERSON AT WORK THE VERY AGENCIES ADDRESSING THE VIOLENCE INCLUDING THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND EFFECTIVE IN THE MANAGEMENT FIELD. PERHAPS THIS IS A LARGE INITIATIVE MENTIONED IN A RECENT HEALTH MATTERS ARTICLE. I BELIEVE CALIFORNIA WOULD BE AMONG THE FIRST STATE IN THE COUNTRY MAYBE THE FIRST STATE TO HAVE SUCH A DEDICATED POSITION.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. MR BONTA THANK YOU FURTHER CONVERSATION THEM I REALLY APPRECIATE THE REACHED OUT TO EVERYONE OF US AND HAD THOSE- INDIVIDUAL CONVERSATION SO I'LL JUST GO THROUGH MY WHICH YOU WERE AWARE OF WHAT I'LL BE ASKING- THE PROBLEM BILL OF ILLEGAL MARIJUANA HAS BECOME QUITE PRONOUNCE INTERVIEW TONIGHT THE REGION I REPRESENT SPECIFICALLY AND SISKIYOU COUNTY. THIS HAS DETRIMENTAL IMPACTS WERE ENVIRONMENT. TOXIC ILLEGAL PESTICIDES ARE BEING USED ON THESE GROW SITES TO DESTROYING ECO SYSTEMS RUNOFF FROM FIELDS ARE POLLUTING OUR WATERWAYS AND HABITAT FOR ENDANGERED SPECIES. IT ALSO BRINGS SERIOUS PUBLIC SAFETY CONCERNS INCLUDING HUMAN TRAFFICKING ORGANIZED CRIME MONDAY MONEY LAUNDERING MANDIRA LAUNDRY EXCUSE ME IN EXTREME CASES HOMICIDES. AS ATTORNEY GENERAL HOW TO ADDRESS ORGANIZED CRIME THAT IS ILLEGALLY CULTIVATING CANNABIS AND ENDANGERING OUR COMMUNITIES. AND WILL YOU COMMIT TO WORKING IN PARTNERSHIP WITH ME AND MULTI AGENCY TASK FORCE TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM IS SISKIYOU COUNTY AND SURROUNDING AREAS. THANK YOU AT THE FOREVER DAILY FOR THEIR EARLIER CONVERSATION THAT WE HAD AND THE QUESTION THAT YOU POSED YOU YOU RAISE AN ISSUE OF- SHARED CONCERN AND PRIORITY FOR ME AND FOR OTHER MEMBERS. ASSEMBLY MEMBER LACKEY AND- SENATOR GROW AT THAT AS WELL I HAVE HAVE RAISED THIS ISSUE AND IT'S AN IMPORTANT ISSUE- IT'S A IT'S AN ISUE THAT I HOPE MY RECORD SHOWS. I CARE ABOUT HAVE TAKEN STEPS TO TRY TO ADDRESS MORE STEPS NEED TO BE TAKEN BECAUSE WE HAVE RESULT YET. BUT WE KNOW THAT WITH M. C. RSA THAT I WORKED ON WITH. KERR JONES SAWYER AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER LACKEY- SOMETHING MEMBER WHAT IF THE MEMBER COOLEY AND PROP SIXTY FOUR- AFTER THAT WE CREATED A REGULATORY REGIME AROUND MEDICAL CANNABIS AND ADULT USE CANNABIS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND THE CONTACT. OF THE ARRANGEMENT IS. COME OUT OF THE SHADOWS INTO THE LIGHT. BE A LEGAL BUSINESS FOLLOWING ALL THE RULES FOLLOW TH REGULATORY REGIME AND YOU CAN BE SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA. ALL RIGHT YOU CAN CREATE GOOD JOBS AND PAY YOUR TAXES. AND HAVE A THRIVING BUSINESS. BUT WE HAVEN'T HAD THAT SHIFT YET- FROM THE ILLICIT MARKET PLACE TO THE LEGAL REGULATED MARKETPLACE. SO WHAT DO WE DO ABOUT IT WE NEED TO ADDRESS IT. AND THE ONE THING YOU KNOW WE NEED TO PRIORITIZE IT WE NEED TO STOP THE OPERATIONS THAT'S WHAT'S KEY IT UNDERMINES THE LEGAL BUSINESSES THAT ARE STRUGGLING MIGHTILY TO COMPLY TO FOLLOW ALL THE RULES TO PAY THEIR TAXES TO DO IT RIGHT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR THEIR PRODUCT IS TESTED IN A STAYS AWAY FROM KIDS AND THAT THERE ARE- AM HONORING THE ENVIRONMENT. SO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY THEY GET SHUT DOWN EXACTLY HOW I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE IT. I'D LIKE TO HAVE ADDITIONAL CONVERSATION ABOUT THE OF THE DOJ LIKE TO HEAR FROM YOU FROM SEVEN MEMBER LACKEY WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE. I DO WANT TO AVOID. ANY ACNE WAR ON DRUGS. I DON'T WANT TO GO THE OVER CRIMINALIZATION ROUTE. BUT I DO WANT THE ILLICIT MARKET. TO IT TO GO AWAY AND TO HAVE ONE MARKET PLACE I REGULATED REGULATED SAFE MARKET PLACE THAT HONORS OUR- OUR ENVIRONMENT OUR CHILDREN. AND PUBLIC SAFETY AND TO THE EXTENT THERE IS ADDITIONAL CRIMINAL ACTIVITY OCCURRING ABOVE BESIDES ACTUAL ILLICIT- OPERATIONS THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED. IN A HUMAN TRAFFICKING YEAH I THINK WHEN YOU WE SPOKE YOU MENTIONED EVEN MURDER- YOU KNOW IF THERE NEEDS TO BE- ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THAT. WE HAVE TOOLS TO MAKE SURE THAT HAPPENS AND I KNOW ALSO IN RURAL AREAS LIKE LIKE YOURS. YOU TALK ABOUT RESOURCES AND STAFFING NEED FOR SUPPORT AFTER DOJ CAN CAN COME IN I HOPE AND BELIEVE JOINT TASK FORCE IS WORKING TOGETHER MAKING SURE THAT THERE'S APPROPRIATE RESOURCES TO ADDRESS. THE SIZE SCOPE AND SCALE OF THE ACTUAL PROBLEM. SO HI THIS IS AN AREA WHERE I WANT TO GET FULLY BRIEFED UP BY THE DEPARTMENT JUSTICE BUT AN AREA OF CONCERN AS A LEGISLATOR. AND AREA THAT I'D LIKE TO WORK ON WITH YOU. THE YOU. FOR THAT CAN TO IT AND I'D LOVE TO TAKE A TOUR YOU CAN SEE FIRSTHAND. I GUESS. MY NEXT QUESTION IS WE ALL KNOW THERE'S CONCERNS WITH THE BACKLOG IN THE APPS SYSTEM. WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS PROBLEM FOR YEARS I'VE YET TO SEE ANY REAL PROGRESS WHAT WE DO TO PROCESS THE BACKLOG AND ENSURE RE REMOVING FIREARMS FROM PROHIBITED PERSONS. THAT'S ANOTHER AREA OF A SHARED. PRIORITY AND CONCERN AND EVERY THAT THAT I'VE WORKED ON AND LEGISLATURE RIGHT WHEN I FIRST CAME IN TWENTY TWELVE TO HELP SUPPORT A I BUDGET ALLOCATION TO- HELP REDUCE THE APPS LIST. AND I WON'T YOU WANT TO REDUCE THE LAST AS FAST AS WE CAN AS AS ACCURATELY AND THOROUGHLY AS WE CAN AND KEEP THE NUMBERS AS LOW AS POSSIBLE. AND THE ONE THING I DO WANT TO POINT OUT ABOUT THE APPS LIST IS THAT IT THE DYNAMIC AS YOU REMOVED PEOPLE FROM THE LIST MORE COME ON ABOUT TEN THOUSAND NEW- ADDITION TO THE LISTING FOR EVERY YEAR AND ABOUT ON AVERAGE TEN THOUSAND ARE REMOVED SO THERE IS PROGRESS BEING MADE IN TERMS OF PEOPLE BEING- MORE ACTIVE CASES COME IN. AND WHEN I WAS ELECTED IN TWENTY TWELVE THAT BUDGET ALLOCATION DID LEAD TO THE BACKLOG AT THAT TIME BEING ARE TOTALLY ADDRESSED OVER THREE YEARS BUT MORE HAVE COME IN AND JUST TO CHALLENGES REALLY AS I UNDERSTAND IT THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE THAT CAN HELP ADDRESS THIS ISSUE ONE IS- A TECHNOLOGICAL PLATFORM. THAT'S COUNTY AND NOT AS MODERNIZE AND AS AS HELPFUL AS POSSIBLE- IN TERMS OF HOW YOU CAN DO KERRY'S AND I AND HAVE ACCURATE DATA THAT IS UP TO DATE THAT CAN BE HELPFUL IN LEADING TO WHAT IS DONE AS YOU KNOW ON THE GROUND WHICH IS ACTUALLY- AGENTS KNOCKING ON SOMEONE'S DOOR- AN INDIVIDUAL WHO HAS- A WEAPONS THAT THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE UNDER THE LAW. THE SECOND ISSUE IS WE HAVE ABOUT A 30% VACANCY RATE IN. THAT WORK FORCE A SPECIAL AGENTS WHO DO THE WORK. AND SO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ADDRESS THOSE ATTRACTION AND RETENTION ISSUES. I HAVE. TOP NOTCH HIGH QUALITY SPECIAL AGENTS THAT CAN DO THE JOB. EFFECTIVELY AND SAFELY- AND THEN I'M OPEN TO OTHER IDEAS FOR HOW WE CAN WORK ON IT TOGETHER. I ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I THOUGHT WOULD BE IMPORTANT WOULD BE TO HAVE. PERHAPS A LEGISLATIVE DOJ WORKING GROUP. HOWEVER WE WORK ON THIS TOGETHER WE CAN GIVE UPDATES ON WHAT WE'RE DOING WE CAN TALK ABOUT THE CHALLENGES THAT I HAVE THE HONOR OF BEING CONFIRMED. AND WE CAN WORK COLLABORATIVELY ON HOW TO OVERCOME THOSE OBSTACLES. SO MY HOPE IS THAT IS YOUR HELP AND I'M I'M I PARK AT THE PRIORITY FOR ME. AND I'M COMMITTED TO GETTING THE APPS WEST. AT THE LOWEST. LEVEL POSSIBLE. JUST A FOLLOW UP TO THAT I READ. NINE COUNTIES AND I'VE HEARD CONCERNS FROM MY COUNTY SHERIFF'S. THAT IN THE PAST THE DOJ HAS- COME INTO THOSE LOCAL COUNTIES. SPECIFICALLY TO- DO WHAT THEY CALL BLOCKING TALKS WITH THE- PEOPLE YOU KNOW FOR. PERSONS ON THE OUTPUT LIST. I JUST WAS WONDERING- HOW YOU A BETTER COMMUNICATION IN THE FORT BUT THE DOJ AND THE LOCAL SHERIFFS AND OF THOSE DEPARTMENTS THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE ASKING FOR IS THAT THEY DON'T FIND OUT AFTER THE FACT THAT THEY'VE BEEN IN THEIR AREA- AGENTS HAVE COME IN WITHOUT THEIR KNOWLEDGE SELF I WOULD JUST ASK FOR BETTER COMMUNICATION FOR OUR LOCAL. ELECTED AND I JUST I HAVE ONE MORE ONE MORE QUESTION. WITH THE MESSAGE VIOLENCE AND HATE CRIMES ON THE RISE THROUGHOUT OUR STATE OUR COMMUNITIES ARE SCARED. IN THE RURAL DISTRICTS LIKE MINE ON CHRISTMAS SERVICE FIRST RESPONDERS AND PROVIDE CRITICAL SUPPORT TO THEIR COMMUNITIES. IN MANY PORTIONS OF MY DISTRICT IN THE STATE RESPONSE TIMES ARE. FOR THE NEAR SHORE AFTER DEPUTY COMMITTEE UP TO AN HOUR. ADDITIONALLY LAW ENFORCEMENT BUDGETS. FIND KEY AVENUES FOR JUSTICE AN ESSENTIAL HEALTH CARE SERVICES FOR VICTIMS SUCH AS SEXUAL ASSAULT MEDICAL FORENSIC EXAMS. HOW DO YOU BALANCE THE NEED FOR REFORM WHICH WILL AGREE. BUT ALSO THE NEED FOR COMMUNITY PROTECTION. THANK YOU LET ME LET ME ANSWER YOUR FIRST QUESTION FIRST. WHICH IS AN IMPORTANT ONE. I THINK WE SPOKE YESTERDAY AND SINCE THEN I LOOKED INTO THE ISSUE OF COMMUNICATION WHEN THE APPS A SPECIAL AGENTS ARE. ARE DOING NOTHING TAX OR- YOU KNOW FLUCTUATING- A SEIZURE OF GUNS FROM SOMEONE WHO SHOULDN'T HAVE THEM. THE INTENT AND THAT THE PROTOCOL IS TO HAVE COMMUNICATION WITH LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT- SOMETIMES OVERLAPPING LAW ENFORCEMENT LIKE A POLICE DEPARTMENT AND THE SHERIFF MIGHT HAVE SOME OVERLAPPING JURISDICTION. AND SO MAYBE ONE OF THEM COULD BE COMMUNICATED TO BUT NOT THE OTHER I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE SURE EVERYONE. THE SHARES THAT JURISDICTION. IS AWARE I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO BE DOING WORKIG TOGETHER COLLABORATING. COMMUNICATING AS THE SECOND QUESTION. THE. MY BELIEF IS THAT CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM. AND PUBLIC SAFETY ARE NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE THAT REFORM SMART REFORM MAKES US SAFER IN ADDITION TO MAKING US MORE JUST AND MORE FAIR. AND SO. THAT BROUGHT IN THIRTY TWO YEAR YOUR QUESTION IS WE NEED TAX UPLIFT ABOUT- FAIRNESS AND JUSTICE. AND WHILE WE ALSO EMPHASIZE SAFETY AND I THINK WE CAN AND ARE ABLE TO GET BOTH OF THOSE DONE SO IN OUR CONVERSATIONS- THAT ISSUES ARE NUANCED AND IF IT'S A CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM IDEA BEING PROPOSED AND- SOMEONE SAYS WELL LET'S TALK ABOUT THE IMPACTS ON COMMUNITY SAFETY THAT'S APPROPRIATE WE SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT THAT. AND THERE SHOULD BE GOOD GOOD RESPONSES TO HAVE IT ALSO MAKES A OUR COMMUNITY SAFE- AND AT THE CORE. I BELIEVE IT TOUGH TO MUCH OF THIS IS THE NEED TO BUILD GREATER COMMUNITY FAST- BUTTON ALONG FOR SMITH AND OUR COMMUNITY AND MY VIEW IS THAT- ARE LAW ENFORCEMENT PERSONNEL. ARE INVALUABLE PARTS OF OUR COMMUNITIES THE VAST MAJORITY OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. WANTS TO BUILD AND MAINTAIN THAT TRUST I JUST TALKED ABOUT. AND ALSO ARE DESERVING OF SUPPORT. AND TRAINING- FOR HOW TO IMPLEMENT. REFORM THAT KEEPS THEM SAFE KEEP THE COMMUNITY SAFE IT ALSO MAKES US. MORE JUST MORE FAIR THE COMMUNITY AND A SOCIETY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU HAVE AS FAR HE HAD IN THIS ROCKY. WELL THANK YOU RESTAURANTS HAVE FOR BEING HERE AND- IT'S AN HONOR IS YOUR COLLEAGUE TO HAVE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO- HAVE THIS CONVERSATION AND VOTE ON YOUR CONFIRMATION TODAY SO THANK YOU FOR THE TIME YOU'VE SPENT WORKING ON. HEARING FOR THIS AND HAVING THIS CONVERSATION WITH THAT. I WANT TO START WITH REPRODUCTIVE CHOICE. AND THE AG'S OFFICE PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN ENSURING THAT WE CONTINUE TO HAVE ACCESS TO COMPREHENSIVE HEALTHCARE IN CALIFORNIA. GENERALLY BY OVERSEEING MERGERS OF HOSPITALS. IN MANY PARTS OF THE STATE WE'RE SEEING MERGERS WITH CATHOLIC HOSPITALS THAT PREVENT SAYS TOO MANY REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH SERVICES. I'D LIKE FOR YOU TO DISCUSS YOUR POSITION ON THESE MURDERS THAT WOULD DENY WOMEN ACCESS TO TUBAL LIGATION TNCS ABORTIONS AND OTHER SERVICES. AND WE DO NOT A TRANCE CALIFORNIANS ACCESS TO THE CARE THEY NEED TO TRANSITION WITH DIGNITY I WHAT YOU WOULD DO TO PREVENT. THAT THE DENIAL OF BACK HERE. THANK YOU THAT ABSOLUTELY IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE- BACK IN FORCE AND SUPPORT THE EXISTING LINE CALIFORNIA- THAT ENHANCE THAT HAS BEEN VERY SUPPORTIVE OF REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM WE HAVE SOME OF THE STRONGEST LAWS IN THE NATION AND SO THE EIGHTIES WRONG GENERALLY IS TO- DEFEND AND ENFORCE OUR LAWS I ONE OF THAT SPECIFIC ROLES THAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL HOUSE IS TO- REVIEW AND APPROVE OR NOT OR NOT APPROVE- CONSOLIDATIONS OF NONPROFIT HOSPITALS SO IT'S LIMITED AMOUNT PASSED WITH AT THE MOMENT OF THE BILLS IN THE PAST THAT WE'RE AWARE OF THAT HAVE SOUGHT TO EXPAND AT A THIRTY BUT NOW IT'S FOR NONPROFIT HOSPITALS. AND IF THEY FOR EXAMPLE A RELIGIOUS AFFILIATED HOSPITAL. DOES NOT PROVIDE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE. YEAH TO MERGE. WITH AN HOSPITAL THAT DOES. IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT THE ATTORNEY- DO A REVIEW AND I AND MAKING SURE THAT THOSE THAT REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE- SERVICES CONTINUE TO BE PROVIDED. THAT THAT'S WHAT THE AG'S OFFICE IN THE PAST AND COMMITTED TO CONTINUE TO DO THAT GOING FORWARD. REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM IS A CRITICAL ISSUE FOR ME AND I WILL BE CHAMPION FOR. THANK YOU SO ONE FOLLOW UP THAT I JUST YOU KNOW I'M I'M YOUR COLLEAGUE HERE AND WORK WITH YOU AND I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE AN INCREDIBLE RECORD. ON REPRODUCTIVE CARE PROTECTING REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM IN CALIFORNIA. BUT YOU HAVE ANY ROLE IN THIS JOB AND SO I JUST WANT TO KNOW IF YOU COMMIT TO DEFENDING. SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE- AND SPECIFICALLY ABORTION SERVICES IN CALIFORNIA. IN YOUR ROLE AS AG. YES I MEAN THAT WE HAVE AS I MENTIONED WE HAVE THE STRONGEST LOSS IN SUPPORT OF REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE- ABORTION ACCESS. I WILL FIGHT IN DEFENDING CHAMPION THOSE LAWS THANK YOU- I WANT TO ECHO THE COMMENTS OF MOVING ON TO GUN VIOLENCE PREVENTION- OF OUR COLLEAGUE FROM THE NORTH STATE WHO TALK ABOUT THE APPS LESS I THINK IT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT PIECE WE PASS A LOT OF US. IN THIS BODY AND ENFORCEMENT OF THEM IS REALLY CRITICAL AND NOW YOU WILL HAVE A ROLE TO ENFORCE THEM AND I THINK THE APPS LIST IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF THAT AND I WON'T ASK ANOTHER QUESTION THAT BECAUSE THAT WAS ADDRESS BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT WE HAVE SPENT A LOT OF MONEY. THE GOVERNMENT TRYING TO CLEAR THAT OBSOLESCENCE AND I THINK WE NEED TO THINK DIFFERENTLY WE FAIL TO DO IT AND I THINK WE NEED TO USE NEW TECHNIQUES AND I COMMEND OUR COLLEAGUE ASSEMBLYMEMBER IRWIN WHO IS THOUGHT ABOUT HOW WE CAN BETTER COORDINATE WITH LOCAL AUTHORITIES AND I JUST HOPE THAT WE WILL DO THE WORK YOU TALKED ABOUT- AND BEING CREATIVE TO ENSURE WE'RE TAKING THOSE GUNS AWAY FROM INDIVIDUALS IN CALIFORNIA WHO SHOULDN'T HAVE THEM AND POSE A RISK- THE- IN YOUR LETTER YOU ADDRESSED. ONE ISSUE THAT MR KING IS CURRENTLY TAKING UP IN THIS BODY WHICH IS THE CURRENT REFUSAL OF OUR ATTORNEY GENERAL TO PROVIDE THE NECESSARY DATA FOR UC DAVIS TO DO THE WORK THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS AND ASK THEM TO DO. TO REALLY DO THE RESEARCH THAT OUR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS FAILED TO DO ON OUR GUN VIOLENCE PREVENTION POLICIES AND HOW THEY WORK AND I THINK DATA AN UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE AND HOW IT'S EXCEEDING IS SO CRITICAL ESPECIALLY IN SUCH A CONTROVERSIAL SPACE AS GUN VIOLENCE PREVENTION SO I KNOW YOU DISCUSSED IT- SHORTLY IN YOUR LETTER BUT I JUST WANTED YOU TO SPEAK ABOUT YOUR DEDICATION. OR YOUR WILLINGNESS. TO REALLY BE A PARTNER IN THAT RESEARCH. I WANT TO BE THE STRONGEST PASSED NOT RESEARCH THE RESEARCH IS CRITICAL WE ALL TALK ABOUT EVIDENCE BASED POLICY DATA DRIVEN POLICY YOU NEED TO HAVE THE DATA AND THE EVIDENCE THE DRIVE THAT POLICY AND YOU NEED THE RESEARCHERS TECH TO PROVIDE TO PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION THAT INPUT SO MY GOAL WOULD BE TO PROVIDE ALL DATA THAT IS LEGALLY PERMISSIBLE TO BE PROVIDED FOR RESEARCHERS TO RESEARCHERS TODAY SO THEY CAN DO THEIR WORK WORK THEIR MAGIC AND BE THE PARTNERS IN DRIVING GOOD POLICY IN CALIFORNIA THEY CAN BE. THANK YOU I'M SO MOVING ON TO THE ENVIRONMENT I KNOW. WE'RE BOTH PARENTS AND I KNOW WE'RE BOTH ENVIRONMENTAL WARRIORS AND I THINK THAT OUR KIDS ARE A HUGE PART OF WHY. WE CARE SO DEEPLY ABOUT- OUR FUTURE AND CLIMATE CHANGE ON THIS PLANET BEING HABITABLE- AND I APPRECIATE YOUR DEDICATION THAT YOU'VE SHOWN ALREADY TO THAT ISSUE AND I. I KNOW YOU WILL CONTINUE TO SHOW- I WANTED TO TOUCH A LITTLE BIT ON ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE- YOU DISCUSSED IN YOUR LETTER. THAT ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE IN THE IMPORTANCE OF IT. IS YOU KNOW I PRACTICED ENVIRONMENTAL LAW FOR. AND FOR A FEW YEARS AND- YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS AGAIN WE CAN PASS ALL THE ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS WE WANT IN THIS BODY BUT IF ENFORCEMENT IS NOT EQUITABLE THAN OUR LAWS WILL BE EQUITABLE. AND I THINK THAT IT'S REALLY CRITICAL THAT WE ENSURE THAT THE RESOURCES OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE. ARE USED TO ENSURE THAT THOSE. ENTITIES THAT ARE HARMING OUR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR ARE LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES ARE HELD TO ACCOUNT. AND I THINK THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT IS ANALYZING. THE WAYS THAT THE ENVIRONMENTAL AND THOSE LAWYERS WERE INCREDIBLE LAWYERS DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. THAT ENFORCE OUR BERMAN ALLIES. WILL YOU ANALYZE HOW THAT'S BEING USED AND SURE THAT THE RESOURCES OF THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE ARE BEING USED TO. TO GO AFTER THOSE THAT ARE HARMING OUR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR WHO HAVE SUFFERED SO FOR SO LONG WITH A HEALTHY CONDITION. IN SHORT YES. THE A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT NAMES FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SOME SAY THE TOP TAX SOME SAY THAT CHIEF OPERATION OFFICER SOME SAY THE CHIEF LAW OFFICER. I CALLED THE PEOPLE'S ATTORNEY THE PERSON WITH A CHAMPION FOR THE VOICELESS THE VULNERABLE THE OVERLOOKED THE CAST ASIDE. AND SEE THEM AND FIGHT FOR THEM ESPECIALLY IF THEY'RE BEING HURT BY THOSE WHO ARE OVER REACHING THEIR POWER ABUSING THEIR POWER THAT'S THE JOB. IN THE HIGH LEVEL THAT'S THE JOB DESCRIPTION AND WHEN IT COMES TO USING LIMITED RESOURCES WE NEED TO HELP THOSE WHO NEED IT MOST FIRST SO THAT IS OUR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THAT IS A VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES THAT IS THOSE WHO ARE SUFFERING AT THE INTERSECTION OF POLLUTION AND POVERTY OFTEN. BUTTON BROWN COMMUNITIES COMMUNITIES OF COLOR SO YES. THANK YOU. I'M MOVING ON TO A TOPIC I KNOW YOUR PASSION ABOUT POLICE ACCOUNTABILITY AND COLONEL JUSTICE REFORM. HAVE YOU IN YOUR LETTER DISCUSSED. RENEWING TRUST. AND THAT BEING A BIG PART OF THE WORK WE HAVE AHEAD OF US BETWEEN OUR COMMUNITIES AND LAW ENFORCEMENT AND I THINK IT WAS SUCH AN IMPORTANT FOCUS AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THAT- UNDER EIGHTY FIFTEEN OH SIX THE ATTORNEY GENERAL THE INVESTIGATING. OFFICER INVOLVED SHOOTINGS OF UNARMED CIVILIANS BUT THAT NARROW. RIGHT IN THAT IT'S ONLY UNARMED CIVILIANS- AND THERE ADDITIONAL INSTANCES WHERE. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IS NEEDED TO STEP IN IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE FAITH IN THE PROCESS- AND- YOU KNOW I KNOW THAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE HAS BEEN HESITANT TO DO THAT THESE ARE CONTROVERSIAL CASES. BUT THIS IS WHERE TRUST CAN BE BROKEN IF THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY HAS A CONFLICT OF INTEREST OR SOME OTHER REASON THAT THERE WOULD BE AN APPROPRIATE AUTHORITY AND THEY ASK THE ATTORNEY GENERAL THE STEP AND- YOU KNOW I BELIEVE THAT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE THAT. OFFICE STEP IN AND DO WHAT IS NEEDED IN THE COMMUNITY TO ENSURE WE REBUILD TRUST AND SO I WANTED TO HEAR FROM YOU WHAT WHAT YOUR POSITION IS ON- OTHER SITUATIONS WHERE DE ASKING TOURNEY GENERAL THE STEP IN WHERE THERE'S BEEN- AN OFFICER INVOLVED SHOOTING BUT MAYBE THE INDIVIDUALS FIRST. FOR EXAMPLE ARMED. THANK YOU. THE AGAIN AND LAW ENFORCEMENT PERSONNEL ARE ABSOLUTELY INVALUABLE PARTS OF OUR COMMUNITY I BELIEVE MOST THE VAST MAJORITY WANT TO BUILD AND MAINTAIN THE TRUST THAT I TALK ABOUT I WANT IMPORTANT PART OF TRUST AS POLICE ACCOUNTABILITY BECAUSE YOU CAN'T HAVE TRUST WITHOUT ACCOUNTABILITY ALSO NEED OTHER THINGS I CAN THINK ANY INVESTMENTS- SERVICE TRAINING SUPPORT- THE ADDRESS IMPLICIT AND EXPLICIT BIAS DE ESCALATION COMMUNITY POLICING. AND IDENTIFY INVESTIGATE HATE CRIMES. AND PLEASE KINDLY WITH THE SPEC OPS IN MARKETING IS AWFULLY CRITICAL- THE MESSAGE THANK YOU TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY WHO WORKED ON THIS BILL IN MULTIPLE VERSIONS FOR MULTIPLE YEARS I WAS PROUD TO WORK WITH HIM AND BE A CO AUTHOR OF AB FIFTEEN OH SIX IT IS ONE OF. THE MOST IMPORTANT- PRIORITIES AND THINGS THE NEXT DAY HE WILL DO WHICH IS STAND UP. THE OFFICER INVOLVED SHOOTING. DIVISION IN THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE. IT'S SO IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT WE NEED TO GET IT RIGHT. IT NEEDS TO BE DONE ARE THESE INVESTIGATIONS NEED TO BE DONE COMPREHENSIVELY AND THOROUGHLY AND ACCURATELY- WITH WITH THE UTMOST INTEGRITY TO EARN THE TRUST THAT I MENTIONED WE DON'T HAVE INTO MANY COMMUNITIES. IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE GENERALLY HAS NOT DONE A LARGE NUMBER OF THESE INVESTIGATIONS EACH YEAR SO IT'S IN SOME WAYS A- A LARGER- RESPONSIBILITY THAN THEY'VE EVER HAD- WE EXPECT BASED ON HISTORICAL DATA THAT ABOUT. THAT THERE WILL BE ABOUT FORTY QUALIFYING OFFICER INVOLVED SHOOTINGS EACH YEAR. A HUNDRED EIGHTY FIFTEEN OH SIX AND THOSE ARE OFFICER INVOLVED SHOOTINGS. THAT RESULT IN THE DEATH OF AN UNARMED CALIFORNIA. I'M COMMITTED TO GETTING THAT RIGHT IF I HAVE THE HONOR PRIVILEGE OF BEING THE NEXT ATTORNEY GENERAL I GETTING THE RIGHT PERSON NON PLACE. GETTING THE RIGHT INFRASTRUCTURE GETTING THE RIGHT. GIVEN THE ABILITY TO DO TO TRANSPORT ANYWHERE IN CALIFORNIA GET ON THE SCENE. IN SHORT NOTICE FLECKED OF THAT STORE THE EVIDENCE PUT TOGETHER A CASE EVALUATED MAKE A CHARGING DECISION THE CHARGING DECISION IS TO CHARGE. MOVED TO TRIAL. AND PERON- YOU KNOW A STRONG CASE OF JUSTICE GO WITH A LOT OF FACTS TAKE YOU. SO THAT'S MY FOCUS AND THAT'S MY PRIORITY I SHOULD I HAVE THE HONOR OF BEING CONFIRMED- ARE THERE OTHER TIMES WHEN- ANNOUNCER BOB SHOOTING REQUIRES INVESTIGATION POTENTIALLY BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. YES THERE ARE- THERE ARE COMPLICATIONS WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE TAKES NOW WHEN A DISTRICT ATTORNEY FOR EXAMPLE A FAMILY MEMBER OR A MEMBER OF THE OFFICE IS EITHER A VICTIM OR A DEFENDANT IN THE CASE SAID THOSE ARE SORT OF CLEAR CASES OF CONFLICT AND IT TURNED OUT HAS TAKEN ON TAKING THOSE ON HIS OTHER CASES WHERE SOMEONE. OR A DISTRICT ATTORNEY- IT'S MAYBE NOT A FORM OFFICIAL CONFLICT BUT- THAT COULD BE THE PARENTS OF A CONFLICT AND SO THEY THINK IT'S BEST NOT TO TAKE THE CASE OR MAYBE THEY DECIDE NOT TO CHARGE. THAT THE FAMILIES OF THE PERSON WHOSE LIFE WAS LOST. IN THOSE INTERACTIONS WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT THEY DESERVE JUSTICE AND THEY DESERVE SOMEONE TO LOOK AT THE CASE. WHO AND WITH WHAT RESOURCES WE'RE GONNA NEED TO TALK ABOUT IT COULD BE IN AND OUTSIDE DISTRICT ATTORNEY OR IT COULD BE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE BUT AGAIN- IF I AM RETURNING GENERAL AND I HAVE THE HONOR OF A TO BE CONFIRMED MY COMMITMENT. IS TO. BE ACCURATE AND COMPREHENSIVE AND THOROUGH. AND GET IT RIGHT FOR EVERY OFFICER INVOLVED SHOOTING THAT WE DO THAT'S WHAT I WE GO TO THE FAMILY. OF THE LOVE ONE LAST. THE PERSON UNDER INVESTIGATION FOR THE LEGISLATURE THAT IS ASKING THE AG TO DO THESE INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU- THE NEXT TOPIC IS A- TIMELY ONE JUST TODAY THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY OF CONTRA COSTA COUNTY CHARGED OFFICER. FOR MANSLAUGHTER IN THE SHOOTING AND THE STAR BALATA. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN. THAT OFFICER WENT ON TO SHOOT ANOTHER INDIVIDUAL JUSTICE ABOUT A MONTH AGO IN OUR COMMUNITY AFTER HE STAYED ON THE JOB. AFTER COMMITTING WHAT. IS KNOWLEDGE SEVEN MANSLAUGHTER- AND I THINK THAT. THIS BODY LAST YEAR STARTED THE CONVERSATION ABOUT DECERTIFICATION AND WHAT OFFICES ARE APPROPRIATE TO CARRY THE BATCH AND CONTINUE TO CARRY THE BADGE AFTER CERTAIN ACTIONS AND I THINK IT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT CONVERSATION AND ONE THAT IS ON GOING IS YOU KNOW IN THIS BODY. I'M CURRENTLY THE PROPOSALS ON THE TABLE OR DIFFERENCE WE HAVE SEVERAL PROPOSALS OF WHAT DECERTIFICATION WILL LOOK LIKE- SB TWO PROPOSES THAT THE DECERTIFICATION PROCESS WOULD SIT IN POST. AND I THINK THAT'S- ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT THAT I HAVE FOR YOU AND IT'S AN OPEN QUESTION FOR ME IS THAT MY GUT TELLS ME THE BEST PLACE FOR THAT PROCESS DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IS NOT A POLICE OFFICER STANDARDS AND TRAINING- AND I JUST WONDERED WHAT YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON THAT IS AND WHETHER YOU WOULD BE A PARTNER IN HAVING THAT CONVERSATION ABOUT WEIRD BASS THE DECERTIFICATION PROCESS SHOULD SET. THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION THE- CONTACT WITH THE CERTIFICATION IS ONE I'VE- AS A LEGISLATOR I'VE BEEN DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN- CO AUTHOR OF SB. TWO CALIFORNIA TAX OFTEN ABOUT HOW WE LEAD WERE FIRST REVOLT- NOT WITH WHEN IT COMES TO DECERTIFICATION WITH FORTY FIVE OTHER STATES ALREADY HAVE DONE THIS SO THIS IS NOT A YOU SHOULD NOT BE A CONTROVERSIAL- CONCEPT THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT- HOW WE DO IT IS IMPORTANT- DUE PROCESS IS IMPORTANT- WHO MAKES THE DECISION IS IMPORTANT. SO I'M SUPPORTIVE OF THE CONCEPT THE DECERTIFICATION. AT THIS TIME I DON'T HAVE A FIRM OPINION ABOUT ALL OF THE DIFFERENT BODIES THAT COULD BE JUNE THE DECERTIFICATION OF COURSE YOU'VE MENTIONED TO POST IN THE OJ I'D LIKE TO GIVE THAT SOME THOUGHT IF- IF POSSIBLE MAYBE CONSULT WITH SOME OF THE- EXPERT IN DOJ ON THIS ISSUE JUST TO PROVIDE AN OPINION ON THAT BUT- I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT WHERE IT RESTS.AND WE'RE RESIDES BECAUSE- YOU KNOW WE ALL BELIEVE THAT SOMEONE WHO HAS COMMITTED EGREGIOUS MISCONDUCT SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO BE FIRED FROM A JOB AND THEN POP UP SOMEWHERE ELSE AND HER COMMUNITIES IN THAT NEW PLACE- BUT WE HAVE TO HAVE TRUST IN IN THAT SYSTEM THAT IS BEING DONE RIGHT. AND ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY SO- I LIKE TO GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT AFTER AFTER FURTHER REFLECTION IF THAT'S OKAY YES OF COURSE THANK YOU AND ONE LAST QUESTION. AND I'LL TURN OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE- SO ONE OF THE THINGS. YOU I HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF SITTING ON THE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE WITH. CHRISTINE SHARE- AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT OFTEN. I KNOW MY COLLEAGUES WHO I BELIEVE IS GOING NEXT- OFTEN REFLECTS ON IN COMMITTEE. IS THAT THE VICTIMS ARE OFTEN MISSING FROM OUR CONVERSATIONS ABOUT CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM AND YOU ACTUALLY MENTIONED THIS EARLIER THAT. A LOT OF OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM CAN BENEFIT VICTIMS THE VICTIMS- ARE A PART OF THE CONVERSATION I KNOW IN YOUR LETTER YOU SPOKE ABOUT RESTORATIVE JUSTICE AND I BELIEVE THEY WERE SORT OF JUSTICE OFTEN IS SOMETHING THE VICTIMS- YOU KNOW ARE PART OF IN SOME OF THESE MOVES IN A LOT OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CAN BE A VICTIM CENTERED. BUT I JUST THINK THAT IT'S SO IMPORTANT THAT WE CONTINUE TO KEEP THEM. IN THE CONVERSATION AND CENTERED IN THE WORK WE DO AS WE DO WORK ON CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM AND SO I WAS WANTED TO HEAR BRIEFLY FROM YOU HOW YOU IS. OUR ATTORNEY GENERAL KEEP VICTIMS IN THE CENTER OF THIS CONVERSATION. THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION. YOU KNOW RIGHT NOW OUR CURRENT SYSTEM. ASK THE QUESTION WHO COMMITTED THE CRIME OF THE CRIMES COMMITTED WHO COMMITTED IT WHAT WE COULD DO ABOUT PERSONAL PASSION- WHATEVER TRIBUTE OF SYSTEM THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE FOR THE MOST PART A RESTORATIVE JUSTICE SYSTEM AFTER A FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT QUESTION THAT IS VICTIM CENTERED. THAT'S WHO'S THE VICTIM WHAT DO THEY NEED TO HEAL AND HOW WE CAN PROVIDE THAT- THAT'S SUPER IMPORTANT TO ME THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE- TO CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORMERS TO MAKE SURE RIGHT NOW WE HAVE A VICTIM IMPACT STATEMENT THAT THAT HAPPENED WITH THE VOICE OF A VICTIM CAN COME INTO THE TO THE- PROCESS. IN SENTENCING IT NEEDS TO BE MORE CENTER THAN NOT- AND ONE OF THE THINGS I'VE BEEN TALKING I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT SHOULD I HAVE DONE APPROVED TO BEING CONFIRMED IS HAVING A MORE ROBUST CENTRALIZED VICTIMS SERVICES COMPONENT THAT THE DOJ IS A PART OF PERHAPS WITH OTHER PARTS OF THE OF THE STATE OKAY THAT'S MORE ROBUST AND PROVIDES THEM GREATER VOICE AND GREATER OPPORTUNITY FOR SUPPORTING HAILING. FROM BEGINNING TO THE END OF THE PROCESS NOT JUST WHEN IT'S TIME TO SENSE. THANK YOU THAT'S THE QUESTION I HAVE I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR OPENNESS HERE TODAY BUT ALSO OVER THE YEARS THAT WE'VE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK TOGETHER AND I KNOW. AND THAT GOING FORWARD AS- YOU KNOW IF THIS BODY CONFIRMS YOU AND THE SENATE- THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE A COLLABORATIVE RELATIONSHIP ON MANY OF THE ISSUES THAT WE- AND THE VALUES THAT WE SHARE I THINK IT WAS. THANK YOU THANK YOU HISTORICALLY HAVE I HAVE MR LACKEY THAN MISTER CHALLENGES WITH. SLASH WELL YOU I'D LIKE TO BEGIN BY USER FEEDBACK IS IT JUST ME. THIS YEAR. I LIKE TO THINK THAT YOU'RE FORGIVEN FOR NOT THE CHAIR BUT- THE LEADER OF. THE STATE ASSEMBLY FOR ALLOWING ME TO- BE PART OF THIS PROCESS IT'S CLEARLY AN HONOR. AND THERE THERE ARE A FEW LEGISLATORS THAT- HAVE LESS IN COMMON WITH ME THAN THE ONE I'M SPEAKING TO NOW AS FAR AS POLITICALLY GOES. BUT I HAVE TO SAY THAT YOU'RE ALSO A PERSON THAT'S PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST COLLEGIAL. IN THE WAY THAT- YOU DISAGREE AND THAT IS. THAT'S A SOUGHT AFTER GIFT IN MY OPINION I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW HOW MUCH OF APPRECIATED. BEING ABLE TO WORK WITH YOU EVEN THOUGH THERE'S ONLY BEEN A FEW THINGS THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO WORK TOGETHER ON. AND- IT TRULY IS AN HONOR. AND I WOULD LIKE TO SAY. JUST SOME. REALLY QUICK AND COGENT REMARKS FROM ON SOME VERY VERY HEARTFELT. SENTIMENTS THAT I HAVE TOWARDS POLICE ACCOUNTABILITY. I BELIEVE IT'S HURTFUL AND UNFAIR TO DEFINE THE LAW ENFORCEMENT PROFESSION THROUGH MISCONDUCT OF A FEW. AND INSTEAD I BELIEVE THAT WE MUST LEARN FROM THAT MISCONDUCT AND MUST REDEFINE. THE PROFESSION TO REASONABLE MEASURES. AND I'M HOPING THAT YOU'LL BE ABLE TO PARTNER WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT. IN ARRIVING AT SOLUTIONS BECAUSE- EXCLUSION LEADS TO WITNESS AN INCLUSION LEADS TO STRENGTH AND I WOULD JUST LIKE TO MAKE THOSE REMARKS BECAUSE I THINK THAT THEY'RE VERY VERY. IMPORTANT TO THE OF PUBLIC SAFETY OF OUR STATE HERE. AND I'D LIKE TO BEGIN. BY FOLLOWING UP WITH THE- SOME OF THE REMARKS OF THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY EXPRESSED ABOUT CANNABIS ENFORCEMENT AND I KNOW THAT YOU KNOW A GREAT DEAL ABOUT THOSE OF THIS ISSUE BUT IT IS BECOMING. AN ALARMING PROBLEM I MADE A VERY VERY. IT'S NOT ONLY SOCIALLY A PROBLEM IT'S BECOME AN ECONOMICALLY A BIG BIG PROBLEM AND AN INCENTIVE FOR PEOPLE WHO SHOULD NOT BE- GETTING PROFITS THROUGH THIS- THIS ISSUE SO. A RECENT FORBES ARTICLE SUGGESTED THE CALIFORNIANS- CALIFORNIA IS A LIST OF CANNABIS MARKET PLACES ANYWHERE FROM TWICE TO THREE TIMES AS BIG AS THE LEGAL MARKET. AND AS WE SAW WITH THE PREVIOUS ATTORNEY GENERAL THERE WAS A LOT OF FINGER POINTING. AS TO WHOSE RESPONSIBILITY IT WAS. TO GO AFTER THE ILLICIT GROWERS ANALYSTS AT RETAILERS THE STATE WOULD SHIFT THE AUTHORITY TO LOCALS IN THE LOCALS WOULD SHIP THE AUTHORITY TO THE STATE. AND SO AS THE STATE. I WOULD SAY TOP. LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIAL BUT YOU LIKE ATTORNEY BETTER SO LET THAT- HOW YOU DIRECT YOUR RESOURCES TOWARD SHUTTING DOWN THE ILLICIT MARKET AND AGAIN. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT I'M NOT ADVOCATING UNIVERSITY ASPECT. I WANT TO GO AFTER THE MONEY. AND THE MONEY IS HOW YOU HAVE IMPACT ON THIS PROBLEM. YES THANK YOU SOME NEVER LACKING FOR LET ME JUST FIRST THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENT TO THE VERY BEGINNING- I'VE ALWAYS APPRECIATED OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH CARTER BILLS TOGETHER WE'VE- ASKED WE WORK ON THE M. C. RSA A HUGE. IMPACT AND MINE- VIEW OF ALONG WITH A CHAIR JONES SAWYER AND OTHERS- BREAKTHROUGH ON AN ISSUE THAT HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT AND CHALLENGING TO OVERCOME. AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THE WAY HE WAS CONDUCTING YOURSELF WITH ME WE'VE HAD OUR DISAGREEMENTS BUT RESPECTFUL ONES AND I'VE I'VE LEARNED FROM MY CONVERSATIONS WITH YOU. AND IT'S MADE ME I HOPE- A BETTER MORE THOUGHTFUL LEADER SO I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK. YOU FOR THAT THANK YOU- THE LIST MARKET PLACE. ME ATTENTION AND TO ADDRESS IT WILL BE RESOURCES. HI I SHARE YOUR VIEW OF NOT MAKING THE RESPONSE ONE THAT LEADS TO- YOU KNOW. PEOPLE IN CUSTODY YOU KNOW IN CRIMINAL CUSTODY I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE ANSWER IS THAT- BUT I KNOW THAT THAT WE DO NEED TO GET AS YOU SAY TO THE MONEY WE NEED TO END THE OPERATIONS. I DON'T KNOW- WHAT THE INTRODUCTION OF WHAT THAT ACTION WHAT THE VARIATION MENU OF OPTIONS ARE AND WHICH ONE IS BEST BUT THAT IS SOMETHING I'D BE COMMITTED TO WORKING ON WITH YOU. I WITH OTHER STAKEHOLDERS TO CERTAINLY WITH THE EXPERT AT THE DEPARTMENT JUSTICE. BECAUSE I AGREE WITH YOU WE HAVE. RESOUNDING AGREEMENT ON THE PROBLEM- IT'S UNACCEPTABLE AND IT'S GROWING. AND IT NEEDS ATTENTION. AND EACH OTHER PRIORITIES BY WHERE YOU PUT YOUR RESOURCES THIS NEEDS RESOURCES. AND IT NEEDS- THE FINGER POINTING THAT YOU THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT. IT IT TO THE EXTENT THAT HAPPENING WE SHOULD BE WORKING TOGETHER COLLABORATIVELY- AND A NOT TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM AT HAND HOW POINT FINGERS AT ONE ANOTHER SO- I'D LIKE TO WORK ON THAT WITH YOU. AND WITH THAT COMES THE DEPARTMENT JUSTICE AND I SHARE YOUR CONCERN ABOUT THE GROWING SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM. WELL THANK YOU THAT I REALLY LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK TOGETHER ON THIS ISSUE I DON'T SUSPECT YOU HAVE THE ACT. THE ANSWER AT THIS POINT. JUST A COMMITMENT TO WORK ON THIS PROBLEM BECAUSE IT HAS BECOME A VERY VERY SERIOUS ONE. NOW FOR THE STICKY WICKET QUESTION- LAST NOVEMBER CALIFORNIANS REJECTED PROPOSITION TWENTY FIVE WHICH WOULD ELIMINATED CASH BAIL HOWEVER A FEW MOMENTS I'M SORRY FEW MONTHS LATER YOU AUTHORED A BILL THAT WOULD. SET BALLOT ZERO FOR MORE STE MOST CRIMINAL OFFENSES AND MANY WOULD SEE THAT IS DEFYING THE WILL OF THE VOTERS THE NEW TWENTY SIXTEEN. VOTERS REJECTED PROP SIXTY TWO WHICH WOULD HAVE ELIMINATED TE DEATH PENALTY IN TWENTY NINETEEN GOVERNOR NEW CEMENT ISSUED A MORATORIUM ON THE DEATH PENALTY AND YOU RELEASED A STATEMENT SAYING YOU APPLAUD THE GOVERNOR'S MORATORIUM ON THE DEATH PENALTY. AND THAT YOU BELIEVE THE DEATH PENALTY IS WRONG FOR CALIFORNIA. ALSO TWENTY NINETEEN YOU CO AUTHOR MEASURE THAT WOULD HAVE ELIMINATED THE DEATH PENALTY. HOW CALIFORNIA'S TRUST THAT YOU REALLY RESPECT THEIR VOICES NOT OVERRIDE THEM THROUGH YOUR OFFICE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION. TOP TWENTY FIVE. WITH WITH WITH THE VOTERS DECIDED AND YOU KNOW PEOPLE WILL HAVE THEIR DIFFERENT VIEWS- TO ME IT IS ABSOLUTELY CLEAR THAT IT WAS NOT A WARM EMBRACE OF THE STATUS QUO MONEY BAIL SYSTEM. I DID SEE ONE ADVERTISEMENT I DID SEE ONE CAMPAIGN COMMUNICATION I DON'T SEE ONE COMMERCIAL THAT SAID VOTE FOR PROP TWENTY FIVE BECAUSE THE EXISTING MONEY BAIL SYSTEM IS GOOD. THE ONLY DISCUSSION THE ONLY DEBATE THE ONLY CAMPAIGN COMMUNICATION. WAS ABOUT WHAT THE REPLACEMENT SYSTEM SHOULD BE AND WHETHER THERE WERE THE PROPOSED FREE TRIAL REPLACEMENT SYSTEM. IN SB TEN IN PROP TWENTY FIVE. WAS APPROPRIATE. THERE WERE SOME VERY POWERFUL PROGRESSIVE VOICES THROUGHOUT THE STATE HE DID NOT THINK IT WAS APPROPRIATE. THEY HAD ANOTHER VISION. AND THAT'S WHERE I THINK THAT'S WHAT I THINK. THAT I FEEL YOUR PROPOSITION TWENTY FIVE STANFORD STANDS FOR. THE PROPOSITION THAT. MONEY BAIL- IS HOME SAFE UNFAIR UNJUST- AND WE DON'T YET AGREE ON WHAT THE REPLACEMENT SYSTEM SHOULD BE. OTHERS WILL DISAGREE WITHOUT THAT'S MY VIEW SO YOU'RE SO IT'S CLEAR I BELIEVE I AM BEING CONSISTENT WITH WHAT THE VOTERS- OF CALIFORNIA I HAVE STATED THEY HAVE THAT BELIEVE THEY STATED THAT THEY WANT ME TO GO BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD. AND IDENTIFY A FAIR SYSTEM TO THE EXISTING STATUS QUO DUST THE BILL. THAT SENATOR HERTZBERG SENATOR SKINNER AND I AUTHORED. HAD MULTIPLE COMPONENTS- ONE- THAT THAT. WAS TO REQUIRE THAT THE ABILITY TO PAY BE CONSIDERED IN SETTING BAIL THE STATE SUPREME COURT JUSTICE CITED THAT THAT IS THE LAW OFFICE OF THE STATE SO THAT COMPONENT IS CONSTITUTIONAL IS LEGAL WE ALSO HAD A ZERO BAIL COMPONENT WHICH MIRRORED IS IT IS ZERO BAIL POLICY OF THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL DURING COATED- I HAD A COUPON IT SO THAT THERE'S NO COST FOR- ANY- CONDITIONS OF. RELEASE AND IT ALSO HAD A HIGHER REFUND ABILITY COMPONENT BUT IT DIDN'T- IT IS OKAY SO IF IT'S A PROPOSAL- THE LEGISLATURE WILL DECIDE THOSE ISSUES WERE NOT VOTED ON AND TOP TWENTY FIVE. THE MORNING PROPERTY FIVE- SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THE LEGISLATURE CAN CONSIDER- THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WILL BE SUBJECT TO DEBATE CANNOT DELIVER TO PROCESS. MAYBE TO PASS MAYBE IT WON'T- BUT THAT THE INABILITY TO PAY COMPONENT IS BECAUSE OF THE JUDICIAL DECISION A CONFERENCE IS NOW. A LOT OF THE STATE. DEFINITELY EXCUSE ME FOR THAT SO THAT THAT WAS ALL ABOUT- I'M AGAINST THE DEATH PENALTY THAT'S MY PERSONAL CHOICE MY PERSONAL VIEW. I THINK IT'S WRONG FOR CALIFORNIA. I DID STAND WITH THE GOVERNOR WHEN HE ISSUE THE MORE TIME I WAS PROUD TO DO THAT. I SHOULD THE STATEMENT THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT I DID ISSUE I DID JOIN WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER- LEVINE. IN A PROPOSAL- TO PUT ON THE BALLOT FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE VOTERS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO- ABOLISHED THE DEATH PENALTY THAT- IS CONSISTENT. WITH SUPPORTING THE VOTERS BECAUSE IT ALLOWS THE VOTERS TO DECIDE. AND HAVE. DEFINITELY MY VIEW IS IN HUMANE. IT DOES NOT DETER- IT IS BOTH FALLIBLE MEANING WERE WRONG WHEN YOU SEE THE DEATH PENALTY SOMETIMES- THE MOST EGREGIOUS CASES WHEN WE- HAVE ISSUE THE DENTIST DEFINITELY TO AN INNOCENT PERSON. AND A REVERSIBLE YOU CAN'T BE BOTH. AND IT'S RACIST SO FOR ALL THOSE REASONS I'M AGAINST THE DEATH PENALTY I ALSO AM VERY WELL MY CONSTITUTINAL DUTIES SHOULD I BE CONFIRMED AS THE CHIEF LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER PEOPLE'S ATTORNEY- IN THE CONSTITUTION AND I WILL- DO VOEPEL HONOR AND MY OBLIGATIONS AND DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITY AND- AS THE TWENTY GENERAL FUND CONFIRMED AND- AND BASED ON THAT IDENTIFY A PROPER PATHWAY FOR REFORM- THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH MY RESPONSIBILITY MY DUTIES. OKAY I'M GONNA MOVE ON TO A RAPE KIT. AND I'VE READ YOUR PROJECT YOUR SUBMITTED REMARKS REGARDING RATE CAPS HOWEVER I JUST WANT TO HAVE FOR THE CLARIFY- YOUR COMMITMENT TO THIS DEGREE JUST PROBLEM TWENTY SEVEN STATES HAVE COME. COMMITTED TO TESTING THEIR BACKLOG OF RAPE KITS ACCORDING TO THE JOYFUL HEART FOUNDATION WHICH WE HEARD FROM EARLIER- A RESPECTED NATIONAL ORGANIZATION THAT ADVOCATES TO END THE BACKLOG- NOT CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA LAW REQUIRES THE TESTING OF ALL S. C. E. CAPS COLLECTED SINCE TWENTY SIXTEEN. BUT NOT BEFORE. THE RECENT DOJ AUDIT OF THE RAPE KIT BACKLOG IDENTIFIED AS SHE INDICATED JUST UNDER FOURTEEN THOUSAND UNTESTED KITS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THE SIGNIFICANT UNDERCOUNTS DO THE DO THE DISMAL RESPONSES SHE INDICATED A FROM THE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES MEDICAL FACILITIES IN CRIME LABS THAT WERE LEGALLY REQUIRED TO REPORT. WHAT IS YOUR PLAN AS A THE NEW NEWLY APPOINTED ATTORNEY GENERAL TO AND CALIFORNIA'S RAPE KIT BACKLOG. I'M COMMITTED TO. AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. REDUCING AND REMOTE AND GETTING RID OF THE STATE'S- AND I SAID I PROBABLY MAKE IT BACK WHILE GOING TO TELL YOU WHAT I LIKE WHAT I MEAN AND- AT THE SEXUAL ASSAULT EVIDENCE KITS I THINK IS WHAT I SAY. HE STANDS FOR. AND I'M GONNA CALL BACK- THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DO D. O. J. DOES NOT HAVE A BACKLOG. WHEN IT COMES TO SEXUAL ASSAULT EVIDENCE KITS THERE ARE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THAT DO. AND I TALKED TO AND OUR SEXUAL. IT COMES OF SEXUAL ASSAULT- DESERVE SUPPORT- THAT THEIR RIGHTS NEED TO BE VINDICATED- THEY HAVE GONE THROUGH A HORRIBLE TRAUMA. AND A SECOND ONE- WHEN THEY'VE GIVEN THE EXAM AND I'VE TALKED TO SOME MEMBER DOLLY ABOUT THAT AND THEN TO SEE THAT KICKED. ON A SHELF SOMEWHERE GATHERING DUST. INSTEAD OF BEING PROCESSED ON THE PATHWAY TO JUSTICE. IT'S JUST WRONG. I WAS LISTENING TO THE COMMENTS TODAY I WAS ACTUALLY TAKING HOMES ABOUT HAVING A PHYSICAL POTENTIAL POSITION IN THE OFFICE WHOSE JOB IT IS TO REDUCE THE SEXUAL ASSAULT EVIDENCE KITS BACKLOG. FOR I HEARD THAT THEY DID NOT CAROLINA THEY PROVIDED GRANTS AND PUSH THEM OUT TO LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO HELP WITH THE PROCESSING AND TO REDUCE THE BACKLOG SO I'M TAKING NOTES ABOUT THE BEST IDEAS INVEST APPROACHES TO HELP ADDRESS- AND REDUCE AND REMOVE THAT BACKLOG AND I'M COMMITTED TO. REMOVING IT. THANK YOU. SOME OF. THANK YOU MISTER LACK OF THIS CHAPTER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- FIRST OF ALL CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR NOMINATION TO BE OUR NEXT EASY ARE YOUR NOMINATION IS INDEED HISTORIC IN THAT- YOU BE. CALIFORNIA'S FIRST ATTORNEY GENERAL OF FILIPINO DESCENT AND AS A MEMBER OF THE API COMMUNITY I COULD NOT BE PROUDER. OVER THE YEARS I BELIEVE YOU HAVE- VIGOROUSLY REPRESENTED YOUR CONSTITUENTS AND CALIFORNIANS ON. MANY IMPORTANT ISSUES- DRESSING JUSTICE IN JUSTICES- ADVANCING REFORMS JUST TO NAME A FEW. BOB YOU'RE A PRAGMATIC APPROACH TO RESOLVING ISSUES AND YOUR ABILITY TO WORK WITH DIFFERENT DIVERSE GROUPS OF STAKEHOLDERS WILL NO DOUBT CONTINUE TO SERVE YOU WELL. AS WELL AS THE STATE. I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS THE FIRST QUESTION DEALS WITH HATE CRIME SO WHICH YOU MENTIONED IN YOUR OPENING REMARKS. I IN FACT OVER THE LAST YEAR WE HAVE SEEN AS SKYROCKETING OF RACIALLY MOTIVATED HATE INCIDENTS AGAINST ASIAN COMMUNITY ACROSS THE STATE. AND THE NATION. THE ORGANIZATIONS STOP EIGHTY P. I. T. REPORTED ABOUT THE- FOUR THOUSAND PIECES OF HATE RELATED INCIDENTS OVER A TEN MONTH PERIOD. AND THIS IS ONLY THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG. NOW THIS ISSUE IS PERSONAL TO ME BUT- THE SENTIMENT IS ALSO SHARED BY MANY OF OUR COLLEAGUES BECAUSE- WHEN THESE VIOLENT ACTS- I COMMITTED THERE NOT. ONLY IMPACTING THE INDIVIDUAL VICTIMS AND ALSO THE COMMUNITY. AT LARGE. HOWEVER MANY HATE CRIMES AND VIOLENT ACTS ARE NOT BEING REPORTED OR PROSECUTED BECAUSE IT'S DIFFICULT TO PROVE THE PERPETRATORS SO INTENT. MY QUESTION IS HOW WOULD THE DOJ UNDER YOUR LEADERSHIP. IMPROVE THE DETECTION INVESTIGATION AND PROSECUTION OF HATE CRIMES AND HATE INCIDENTS. AND AS A COOK A QUICK FOLLOW UP I UNDERSTAND THAT THE RAPID RESPONSE TEAM WITHIN THE DOJ FOCUSES ALL ONLY ON A SERIOUS CRIMES. SO THE QUESTION IS HOW WOULD THE DOJ AGAIN UNDER YOUR LEADERSHIP WORK WITH OTHER AGENCIES TO ADDRESS HATE RELATED INCIDENTS. THANK YOU SOME EVER TELL FOR YOUR YOUR COMMENTS IN YOUR QUESTION. FOR THE API COMMUNITY RIGHT NOW WHEN IT COMES TO HATE CRIMES WERE AN AWFUL STATE OF CRISIS AND A FULL STATE OF EMERGENCY IN MY HEART GOES OUT TO. ALL OF THE VICTIMS AND SURVIVORS OF HATE CRIMES THROUGHOUT THIS NATION INCLUDING IN ATLANTA- BUT ALSO. IN MY OWN DISTRICT IN OAKLAND AND SAN FRANCISCO AS YOU MENTIONED THIS BEFORE THOUSAND CASES. OVER THE PAST YEAR- FROM C. SPITTING AND YELLING AT INDIVIDUALS TO. PUNCH IN THE FACE AND- WASHING THEM DOWN TO. SLASHING HIM ACROSS THE FACE AND MURDERING THEM. AND IT'S UNACCEPTABLE AND WE HAVE A PROBABLY HAD ALLIES AND MEMBERS OF LEADERS NAY PI COMMUNITY COMMITTEE LEADERS CONDEMN AND DENOUNCE AND WE'RE ALSO BEEN TAKING ACTION I KNOW THAT A NUMBER OF YOU HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE HAVE INTRODUCED LEGISLATION TO ADDRESS. AT THE STATE EMERGENCY THE STATE OF CRISIS AND I APPRECIATE THAT THE PASSION ON THIS ISSUE AND THE PROPOSAL OF SOLUTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN PUT FORWARD- THE DOJ. CAN DO A NUMBER OF THINGS ONE IS. HELP OTHER JURISDICTION'S LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES APPROPRIATELY IDENTIFY AND INVESTIGATE HATE CRIMES THAT IS NOT ALWAYS SOMETHING. THAT IS FOCUSED ON PRIORITIZED- AND LET ME JUST BACK BACK UP ONE STEP INTO SAFE IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT ONE REALLY POINTING THE DOJ CAN DO IS TO CARE. AND TO PRIORITIZE THIS ISSUE AND MAKE IT A TOP PRIORITY AND- THE INVESTIGATION AND IDENTIFICATION SHE WAS ONE BUILDING STRONG RELATIONS BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND COMMUNITY SO THAT COMMUNITY WILL COME FORWARD AND REPORT. I'M SUPPORTING VICTIMS- IN DIFFERENT WAYS WHETHER IT BE PROVIDING MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OR ACTION TRAUMA INFORMED CARE FOR LANGUAGE ACCESS- FOR SOME OF OUR API COMMITTEE MEMBERS- FROM THAT WOULD BE SUPPORTIVE AND HELPFUL AND THEN THE REPORTING SYSTEM IS ALSO VERY IMPORTANT- I KNOW SOME OF OUR COLLEAGUES HAVE PUT FORWARD AN IDEA FOR A HE CAN TIMELINE. I TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GET ACCURATE REPORTING THEY CAN DRIVE APPROPRIATE POLICY AND INTERVENTION. SO- YOU KNOW WE CAN PUT UP- TO ABOUT- TO SHOW OTHER. THE BEST WAY TO ADDRESS TAKE HOME SO WE CAN SHOW THAT'S PACKED. ONE THING I THINK IS SUPER. IS TO GET OUT IN THE COMMUNITY. AND LISTEN. AND SEE COMMUNITY C. IMPACTS MANY WHO'VE BEEN HURT. ASK WHAT THEY NEED ASK WHAT- SUPPORT THE DOJ CAN PROVIDE SO I KNOW THAT'S A- RATHER- LONG MENU OF OPTIONS. AND ACTIONS THAT THE DOJ CAN TAKE BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT I'VE. THOUGHT ABOUT AND I THINK ALL CAN ADD VALUE. ANOTHER AREA OF INTEREST FOR ME IS- DATA PRIVACY WHICH IS- BECOMING MORE AND MORE. IMPORTANT IN LIGHT OF THE FACT THAT. ALL PERSONAL INFORMATION IS CONSTANTLY BEING COLLECTED AND SHARED BY OTHERS- LAST YEAR IN TWENTY TWENTY TO VOTERS IN CALIFORNIA. A PASSED PROPOSITION TWENTY FOUR- WHICH BASICALLY CREATED THE NEW A NEW. PRIVACY PROTECTION AGENCY MY QUESTION TO YOU IS. HOW DO YOU FORESEE THE DOJ WORKING WITH THIS NEW AGENCY- IN ENFORCING CONSUMER PRIVACY LAWS IN CALIFORNIA. JORDAN COLLABORATIVELY WORKING TOGETHER. AND WORKING AS A TEAM- AS- DEFENDERS OF PRIVACY AND SUPPORTERS OF CONSUMERS- I KNOW THIS IS BEEN A PRIORITY FOR YOU- AT AREA OF PASSION I APPRECIATE YOUR LEADERSHIP IN THE SPACE. AND THE PROPOSITION PROVIDES ROLE AND RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE NEW PRIVACY AGENCY IT ALSO PROVIDES A REAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE DEPARTMENT JUSTICE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. SO IT'S IMPORTANT THEY'RE COMMUNICATING WORKING TOGETHER- MAKING SURE THAT BETWEEN THE TWO OF THEM. ALL ISSUES THAT CAN BE ADDRESSED ARE BEING ADDRESSED. TO ENSURE THE PRIVACY OF CONSUMERS IN CALIFORNIA. I THANK YOU. THIS WORKS. MISTER CHAIR- EXCITED TO SEE YOU HERE ASSEMBLY MEMBER BONTA AS MY NEIGHBORING COLLEAGUES- WE SHARE THE CITY OF THE GREAT CITY OF OAKLAND- AND NOW YOU'RE DISTRICTS CAN I GET A LOT BIGGER- HERE INSTEAD OF CALIFORNIA- I HAVE FOUR QUESTIONS- FOR YOU SOME OF WHICH HAVE ALREADY. BEEN ADDRESSED BY THE LITTLE BIT OF A TRICK ON THEM I ALSO WANT TO ECHO THE CONCERNS AND- HOPES THAT- THE VIN REYES- BY- TO OUR COLLEAGUES HERE ON THE APPS PROGRAM ENSURING THAT- AND I THINK IF YOU ANSWER THE QUESTION ADEQUATE I. TWENTY GO ON THE RECORD SHOWING THAT CONCERN AS WELL AND HOPEFULLY HE WILL- IMPLEMENTS- ABSENT A MORE EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT WAY- ONE OF THE QUESTIONS MY COLLEAGUE FROM AROUND IT. DISCUSSED A LITTLE BIT IN TERMS OF- THE GUN VIOLENCE DATA TRANSPARENCY ISSUES THAT WE'RE SEEING RECENT YOU KNOW NEWS STORIES ABOUT DOJ- INCREASINGLY BLOCK GUN VIOLENCE RESEARCHERS ACCESS OF THE QUESTION THAT SHE ASKED- WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY VERY VERY CRITICAL TO UNDERSTANDING THE IMPACT OF. GUN SAFETY LAWS. I'M AS WELL AS THE GAPS IN THOSE LAWS. IN ADDITION TO THAT THERE'S A PART HAS ALSO RECENTLY PROPOSED NEW REGULATIONS THAT WOULD FORMALISE THESE RESTRICTIONS- AND SHOULD YOU- BECOME OUR ATTORNEY GENERAL WHICH IS A PRETTY GOOD SENSE YOU WILL BE. WOULD YOU REVERSE THOSE NEW PROPOSALS OTHERS YOU PROPOSED REGULATIONS AND INSTEAD YOU KNOW REVIVED THE DEPARTMENT'S LONGSTANDING PRACTICE OF MAKING RELEVANT RECORDS. ACCESSIBLE TO RESEARCH CONSISTENT WITH EXISTING PRIVACY PROTECTIONS. LET ME JUST SAY THIS FIRST DAY THANK YOU FOR ALL THAT THE WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE IN THE SPACE FOR TO PROVIDE MORE GUN SAFETY ADDRESSING GUN VIOLENCE FOR YOU AND YOUR FAMILY. AT THE BIG LEADERS NATIONALLY IN THE SPACE. AND WE KNOW THE RESEARCH IS IMPORTANT AND MY GUT AND MY HEART MY VALUES TELL ME. WE SHOULD BE DISCLOSING AS MUCH DATA AS LEGALLY PERMISSIBLE TO THE RESEARCHERS TO AS YOU SAY YOU HAVE GOT TO GUIDE US IDENTIFY THE GAPS TELL US WHAT POLICIES CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE TO MOVE THE NEEDLE- I HAVEN'T SEEN THAT THAT THE REGULATIONS- IF I AM CONFIRMED. WHEN I FIRST ORDERS OF BUSINESS WILL BE TO REVIEW THEM GET BRIEFED ON THEM. NOW WHAT'S BEING PROPOSED AND WHY AND THEN MAKE A DECISION ABOUT THEM THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH MY VALUES. I ALSO KNOW THAT ASSEMBLYMEMBER TING IS HELPING TO ADDRESS AN ISSUE THAT CAN PROVIDE CLARITY AND I'VE ALSO EARD AND AS I'M GETTING MY HEAD AROUND SORT OF- THE POSSIBILITY OF A TWENTY EXECUTIVE BRANCH THAT WHEN WE AS LEGISLATORS. LEGISLATE WE DO OUR BEST BUT THE BEST POLICY INTO THE WORLD BUT WHEN IT'S RECEIVED BY THE PERSON OR ENTITY OR DEPARTMENT AGENCY RESPONSIBLE FOR IMPLEMENTING. THERE MIGHT BE SOME AMBIGUITY THERE MIGHT BE AN UNATTENDED CONSEQUENCE THERE MIGHT BE SOMETHING THAT'S NOT CLEAR- AND THAT AND- I WOULD ON ISSUES THAT. IF I AM I HAVE THE HONOR OF BEING CONFIRMED AS THE AG IT IS AN ISSUE THAT RELATES TO THAT APARTMENT I WOULD TRY TO. WORK WITH MY COLLEAGUES TO ADDRESS THOSE BEFORE THEY BECOME LAW AND IF THEY DO BECOME LAW- YOU KNOW WORK ON THAT CLARIFICATION SO WE CAN GET THE WHAT. GET TO THE GOAL THE GOAL HERE IS TO GET SUBSTANTIALAFFECTIVE HEALTH RESEARCH I WANT TO GET TO THAT GOAL AND I WORK WITH YOU TO GET THERE. GREAT THANK YOU I WILL WORK WITH YOU AS WELL AS YOU KNOW- MY SECOND QUESTION IS ABOUT DONOR ADVISED FUNDS WHICH WAS RAISED- IN THE PERSPECTIVES- FROM- ONE OF THE WITNESSES EARLIER- AND I'VE DONE SOME WORK IN THE SPACE FROM THE LEGISLATURE- BUT JUST AS A SORT OF REFER CALIFORNIA FORGOES FORGOES. A CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATE OF ABOUT. THREE OR FORTY MILLION A YEAR AND THE GENERAL FUND REVENUE. TO PROVIDE TERRIBLE DOT. FOR DONOR BY FUND COUNTRY- WITH COMPARE. BENEFIT TO THE PUBLIC. WELL DRAFT UNDERTAKEN IMMEDIATE TAX DEDUCTION THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT ANY DOUBT FUNDS WILL ACTUALLY REACH CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS. THE MONEY CONSIDER THE DEATHS. IN PERPETUITY- MANY OF SOME OF THE MONEY DOES MAKE IT INTO THE COMMUNITY AND SOME OF IT DOESN'T WE JUST DON'T KNOW THERE'S NOT A LOT OF TRANSPARENCY- AROUND IT AND I THINK ACCOUNTABILITY ON THIS MONEY IS CRITICAL ESPECIALLY AS WE'RE MAKING THIS DEAL THAT. YOU KNOW A DONOR CAN GIVE A TAX WRITE OFF THAT COMES OUT OF OUR GENERAL FUND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THE MONEY DIDN'T. MAKES IT INTO THE NONPROFIT THAT ARE SERVING OUR COMMUNITIES. AS ATTORNEY GENERAL HOW YOU UTILIZE YOUR AUTHORITY AS A CHARITABLE TRUST REGULATOR TO REQUIRE ADDITIONAL TRANSPARENCY REPORTING. BY DONOR ADVISED FUNDS ESPECIALLY WITH. THOSE ASSOCIATED WITH THE LARGER COMMERCIAL INVESTMENT BANKS. LET ME START BY SAYING I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT. THE GOOD WORK OF OUR- CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS ON THE GROUND HELPING PEOPLE- AND WE YOU KNOW WE HAVE A TAX CODE THAT ALLOWS FOR- DONATIONS TO CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTIONS FREE OF TAX IN ORDER TO SUPPORT THEIR IMPORTANT WORK. AND. THAT THE DONOR ADVISED FUND ISSUE THAT YOU HAVE TO HELP ME UNDERSTAND BETTER THANK YOU- YOU KNOW IT YOU YOU BOOKED THE HEAD THE CALIFORNIA BUDGET. AND YOU- AND- THE TAX WRITE OFF IS TAKEN BY THE DONOR BUT THAT BUT THE WHOLE REASON FOR THE POLICY. TO HAVE- ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR CHARTER ORGANIZATIONS DOING GOOD WORK ON THE GROUND IS NOT REALIZED YET. MAYBE IT WILL BE IN THE FUTURE BUT IT HASN'T YET SO I UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM- I GUESS MY- RESPONSE TO A QUESTION ABOUT WHAT WILL I DO IS I'D LIKE TO WORK WITH YOU TO IDENTIFY AND WHAT ARE THE BEST PATHWAYS I LIKE TO WORK WITH THE DOJ EXPERTS IN IN AND OUR- YOU KNOW CHARTER ORGANIZATION ACCOUNTABILITY GROUP TO GET ADVICE ON WHAT TO THIRTY WE DO HAVE I MEAN WHAT A THIRTY WE MIGHT NEED. TO BE ABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT- PARDON REVISED FUNDS ARE WORKING IN A WAY THAT. ARE RIGHT FOR THE STATE AND RECORDS ARE BALKANIZATION. THINKING OF- MOVING ON TO REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM IN IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN KINGS COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY D. A. KEITH- BURGUNDY'S CHARGED A DORA PREZ A TWENTY NINE YEAR OLD WOMAN WITH MURDER AFTER SHE EXPERIENCED A STILLBIRTH. A YEAR LATER HE BROUGHT SIMILAR CHARGES AGAINST CHELSEA BECKER THAN TWENTY FIVE UNDER VIRTUALLY IDENTICAL FACTS BOTH WOMEN. I HAVE A SUBSTANCE ABUSE DISORDER AND WERE REPORTED TO THE POLICE BY STAFF AT ADVENTIST HEALTH HANFORD HOSPITAL. DURING HER INITIAL- THE PROSECUTION THE DOOR OF HER KAREZ RECEIVED INADEQUATE LEGAL COUNSEL AND PLED GUILTY TO MANSLAUGHTER FOR LOSING HER FETUS A CRIME THAT DOESN'T ACTUALLY EXIST IN CALIFORNIA. SHE IS NOW THREE YEARS INTO ELEVEN YEAR PRISON SENTENCE. CHELSEA BECKER IS STILL CHALLENGE YOUR PROSECUTION BUT IS BEING HELD IN JAIL ON A TWO MILLION DOLLAR BAIL WHICH DATE- FIGURE THIS EXPLICITLY ARGUES. IS TO QUOTE PREVENT THE PROSPECT OF INSPECTOR BECOMING PREGNANT AGAIN. THESE CASES REPRESENT A GROWING EFFORT. ON TOP OF THE WIDE SCALE ROWS OF ABORTION RIGHTS TO CONTROL AND REGULATE FORGET PEOPLE'S BODIES. PRIOR TO THESE CASES EVERY CALIFORNIA COURT THAT IS TAKEN UP THIS QUESTION IS A FIRM THAT WOMEN CANNOT BE PROSECUTED FOR THE OUTCOMES OF THEIR PREGNANCIES. CRIMINALIZING PREGNANCY OUTCOMES OPENS THE DOOR FOR THE STATE TO INTERROGATE AND PROSECUTE ANY ACTION THAT COULD POTENTIALLY LEAK WILL. LEAD TO A PREGNANCY LOSS. MISCARRIAGES AND STILLBIRTHS ARE UNFORTUNATELY COMMON OUTCOME OF PREGNANCY AND THIS PRESIDENT WOULD DISPROPORTIONATELY HARM BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES WHO WAS A PRODUCT OF DECADES OF STATE DISCRIMINATION ELECT. HAVE ADEQUATE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE AND OTHER VITAL RESOURCES THAT PLACE THEIR HEALTH AND THEIR FAMILIES AT RISK THOSE CASES ARE ALARMING TO ME AND I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT'S HAPPENING. IN CALIFORNIA OR IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. SO AS AG- THE CREDIT FORMER AG UP IS THERE A FILED AN AMICUS BRIEF EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR THESE TWO WOMEN HELSEA AND ADORA WHO HAVE BEEN ERRONEOUSLY PROSECUTED FOR PREGNANCY LOSS. IN THESE BRIEF HE AFFIRMED THAT THE PORTION OF THE CALIFORNIA PENAL CODE THAT APPLIES TO FETAL MURDER EXPLICITLY EXCLUDES THE PREGNANCY THE PREGNANT PERSON'S. PERSONAL SELVES FROM PROSECUTION UNDER THE STATUTE WILL YOU COMMIT TO CONTINUING SUPPORT FOR MISS BACKER AND DISPERSED CASES AND ANY OTHERS LIKE THIS. YES I DO NOT AGREE WITH THE PROSECUTOR DECISIONS THAT WERE MADE IN THOSE ASES I DO AGREE WITH THE AMICUS BRIEF. SUBMITTED BY TWENTY JOURNALISTS ARE. THANK YOU AND JUST ONE LAST QUESTION- POGOR POLICE OFFICER BILL RATES- MANY ADVOCATES- HAVE EXPRESSED DESIRE FOR REFORMS ON THIS ESPECIALLY IN THE WAKE OF WHAT WE'VE BEEN SEEING IN TERMS OF THE NATIONAL CONVERSATION- AROUND POLICE BRUTALITY- I WANTED TO GET A SENSE FROM YOU ON DO YOU THINK COBAR NEEDS REFORMS- AND IF SO DO YOU HAVE SPECIFIC OFF ON IT. ALSO GENERALLY WE'RE IN A- RACIAL JUSTICE RECKONING AND A AND A RECKONING ON ON HOW WE POLICE AND WHAT'S WORKING AND WHAT'S NOT WHAT WE CAN DO BETTER WHAT REFORM LOOKS LIKE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THINGS LIKE THE CERTIFICATION WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THINGS. LIKE SB FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE DISCLOSURE OF POLICE PERSONNEL RECORDS UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES- WE'RE TALKING pSTATUTORY IMMUNITY IN CERTAIN CASES THOSE OF THE RIGHT DISCUSSIONS WE NEED TO. BE THOUGHTFUL- BALLOTS- REFORM- BALANCE IN OUR REFORM JUSTICE AND FAIRNESS COMPASSION HUMANITY AND MAKE SURE OUR WORK SUPPORTING SAFETY AS WELL. AND BUT FOR PROPOSALS THAT REFLECT THOSE VALUES- OF JUSTICE AND SAFETY OF FAIRNESS AND COMPASSION SO. I THINK WHERE WE'VE BEEN AND I'M PROUD THAT WE'VE BEEN IN THIS BODY- LEADERS IN THAT IN THAT DISCUSSION. AND I THINK IT WILL LEAD TO GOOD RESULTS. WELL I APPRECIATED AND- TO BE MAKING THREE LOOK FOR TO WORKING WITH YOU ON ALL THESE ISSUES AND MANY MORE. THANK YOU FOR MEMBERS. THANK YOU BUSINESS HOURS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. AND I WANT TO APOLOGIZE WE PLAYED PHONE TAG BUT DIDN'T GET TO SPEAK BUT IF I TOLD YOU LAST NIGHT VIA TEXT AND REALLY HAVE NO CONCERNS SO- I DIDN'T FEEL IT WAS REALLY NECESSARY- MY ONLY CONCERN WOULD BE OF COURSE THAT YOU CONTINUE YOUR GREAT ADVOCACY- THAT YOU EXPRESSED AS A LEGISLATOR IN THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE. I HAVE A QUESTION- THAT WASN'T COVERED BY ANY OF THE KIND OF GROUPS IN AREAS WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER OR WASN'T ASKED BUT AS YOU KNOW AND BE PART OF THIS BODY- SINCE WE FIRST GOT HERE THERE HAS BEEN A SYSTEMATIC ATTACK ON ENFORCEMENT. ANY TYPE OF ENFORCEMENT OF LABOR LAWS AND BILLS SO WHEN WE FIRST GOT HERE IT WAS TAKING OUT THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION FOR WORKERS TO PURSUE THEIR OWN INTEREST- THAT THERE WAS THEN AN ATTACK CONTINUES THE ATTACK ON PADA WHICH ALLOWS YOU KNOW ATTORNEYS TO BE PERSONALLY JEEZ- AND NOW JUST RECENTLY WE SAW THE MOST CRITICAL ATTACKS ON- FUNDING OF THE LABOR AGENCY IN ORDER TO ENFORCE LABOR LAWS. THAT BEING SAID WE ALWAYS HAVE A BACKSTOPS TO DETERMINE GENERAL'S OFFICE AND- WE'VE BEEN WRITING IN THAT BACKSTOPS MORE MORE LAWS IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE TO THAT END- THE PREVIOUS ATTORNEY GENERAL HAVE YOU EVER SET UP WAS AN INCREDIBLE PARTNER IN- REALLY ESTABLISHING. STANDARDS FOR A- INVESTIGATION AND PROSECUTIONS- SCOPE IN FACT IN JANUARY HE ESTABLISHED A WORKER RIGHTS AND FAIR LABOR SECTION. OF THE DOJ WHAT ARE NUMBER ONE WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS FOR THAT SECTION. AND ARE YOU WILLING TO CONTINUE- TO STAND UP AND SOMETIMES STAND AGAINST YOU KNOW VERY POWERFUL CORPORATIONS WERE MISTREATING WORKERS- ON BEHALF OF PEOPLE CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU AS A MEMBER GONZALEZ FLETCHER FOR. GIVE ME JUST A YEAR YOUR FIERCE UNPARALLELED LEADERSHIP SUPPORTING WORKERS AND I AGREE WITH- THAT THE VISION AND VALUES- ATTORNEY GENERAL ETCETERA AND CREATING- OTHER WORKERS RIGHT TO FAIR LABOUR SECTION. AND I PLAN TO CONTINUE. GRAYSON FOR HIM STARTING IT AND USE IT TO ADDRESS ANY ABUSES OR MISTREATMENT OR HARM TO WORKERS WHETHER THAT'S MISS CLASSIFICATION OR WASTE AFTER UNDERGOING CANNOT KANEMI OR HUMAN TRAFFICKING FOR LABOUR- HEALTH AND SAFETY VIOLATIONS. WORKERS DESERVE SUPPORT IT IS OUR CHAMPION WILL DEFEND THEM INTERVIEW MISTREATED AND ABUSED SO I WILL LEAN INTO THAT WORK AND BUILD ON THE GREAT WORK ALREADY STARTED BY TWENTY CAMPUS THAT. THANK YOU THIS CUNNINGHAM. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- CONGRADULATIONS AS MANY OF SAID ON YOUR ON YOUR NOMINATION- THANK YOU I HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR YOU I'VE ENJOYED OUR TIME TOGETHER IS COLLEAGUES LIKE WITH. ANTICIPATED I'LL BE SAD TO SEE GO- I DID HAVE A COUPLE. LINES OF INQUIRY- ONE REGARDS THE INITIATIVE PROCESS AND THE- THE RESPONSIBILITY THAT I BELIEVE VERY IMPORTANT POSSIBILITY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL CALIFORNIA TO WRITE BALLOT MEASURE TITLES AND SUMMARIES FOR STATEWIDE INITIATIVES- IN FACT UNDER THE ELECTION CODE SECTION NINE ZERO FIVE ONE C. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S REQUIRED BY LAW TO DRAFT QUOTE TRUE AND IMPARTIAL. IN QUOTE TITLES AND SUMMARIES. THAT ARE NOT QUOTE LIKELY TO CREATE PREJUDICE FOR OR AGAINST THE PROPOSED MEASURE- IT HAS BEEN OBSERVED BY SOME. IT'S MY PERSONAL OPINION THAT NOT EVERY ATTORNEY GENERAL WE'VE HAD IN THE PAST THIS- THE STATE FAITHFUL TO THIS LEGAL REQUIREMENT. ELECTION CODE AND I'M NOT ALONE IN THAT OPINION THE MERCURY NEWS EDITORIAL BOARD IN TWENTY TWENTY- CALLED OUT TO A PARTICULAR BALLOT DESCRIPTION AS TRICKING THE ELECTRIC. AND SAID THE DISTRUST THE GOVERNMENT CAN SPILL OVER INTO OTHER ISSUES IN THE CONSEQUENCES CAN BE SEVERE. AND THE L. A. TIMES EDITORIAL BOARD ALSO WROTE LAST FALL. THAT A PARTICULAR. BALLOT MEASURE FOR CERTAIN FORSAKES IMPARTIALITY IN FAVOR OF LOADED AND MISLEADING LANGUAGE DESIGNED TO SWAY. VOTERS THE BOTH OF THOSE EDITORIAL BOARDS THOSE PAPERS CALLED ON A BALLOT INITIATIVE IRONICALLY TO BE PLACED ON THE BALLOT FOR VOTERS TO TAKE THE ROLE OF DRAFTING THE DAUGHTER OF SUMMARY AWAY FROM THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. AND PUT IT IN THE NONPARTISAN LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. OTHER PLACES YOU COULD GO BUT THAT. MAKE CERTAIN ASSETS SIDE COUPLE QUESTIONS FOLLOWING UP ON THAT BACKGROUND MATERIAL THE FIRST IS- DO YOU AGREE THAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SHOULD HAVE% THE ROLE. OF DRAFTING BALLOT TITLE AND SUMMARY. WOULD YOU BE OPEN TO IT- TO A REFORM IN THAT REGARD THAT WOULD PUT IT WITH THE L. A. O. THE- FIRST QUESTION THE SECOND QUESTION IS- I GUESS. IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO ME BECAUSE EVERYBODY LIKES A LOADED BALLOT TITLE AND SUMMARY WHEN IT GOES THE WAY THEY WANT ON THE INITIAL- BUT THAT. IS A DOUBLE EDGED SWORD AND LONG RUN. MY FEAR IS. THAT IF THIS IMPORTANT SACRED DUTY THAT IS VESTED RIGHT NOW WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO WRITE A TRULY- TRUE AND IMPARTIAL TITLE AND SUMMARY THAT DOESN'T PROJECTS WHEN WE'RE NOT. IS NOT HEATED IT WILL UNDERMINE A COREFUNCTION AND TRUST IN THE CORE FUNCTION OF OUR UNIQUE DIRECT DEMOCRACY SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA THAT IS. PART AND PARCEL OF HAVINGA STRONG DEMOCRACY- SO I'M LOOKING FOR AN ANSWER TO THE FIRST QUESTION AS TO WHETHER YOU THINK THAT THAT ROLES REMAIN WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE OPEN TO THAT CHANGING AND THE AND THEN I'M LOOKING FOR. A COMMITMENT TO THE BEST OF YOUR ABILITY TO DISCHARGE THIS DUTY UNDER THE ELECTION CODE NINE ZERO FIVE ONE C. IN THE BEST WAY YOU POSSIBLY CAN TO BE TRULY. A FAIR AND IMPARTIAL. THANK YOU. HI FOR CENTER STAND IN APPRECIATE YOUR CONCERN ABOUT THE IMPACT ON. TRUST AND IN OUR DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS. AND RIGHT NOW- THE LAW IS THAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL- PREPARES THE TITLE AND SUMMARY I BELIEVE. IF I HAVE DONE A BILL WOULD HAVE BEEN CONFIRMED THAT I. CAN AND WILL- DISCHARGED THAT DUTY I TRUTHFULLY. AND IMPARTIALLY FAIRLY. AND ACCURATELY AND- YOU MENTIONED SOMETHING WE SPOKE THAT I THOUGHT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT TALKING ABOUT- USING LANGUAGE THAT IS INFORMATIVE AND HELPFUL. AND CLEAR AND NOT CONFUSING FOR VOTERS THAT- THAT THE TITLE SUMMARY SHOULD MAKE IT CLEAR TO VOTERS WHAT THEY'RE VOTING ON CAMPAIGNS ARE FOR PERSUASION TITLE AND SUMMARY IS FOR. UNDERSTANDING THE ISSUE. AND THE JOB OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IS TO CALL BALLS AND STRIKES WHEN IT COMES THE TITLE AND SUMMARY AND I'M I BELIEVE THAT I CAN AND WILL. I DO THAT QUICKLY AND IMPARTIALLY AND FAIRLY IF I. HAD THE HONOR OF BEING CONFIRMED. THANK YOU FOR THAT ANSWER I AGREE WITH YOU AND I LOVE THE DESCRIPTION OF CALLING BALLS AND STRIKES I THINK THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THE- ELECTION CODE CALLS ON THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO DO- MY OTHER LINE ANGRY REGARDS- ANTI TRUST LAW AND THE ROLE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL- THE SHORT ANSWER THE SHORT VERSION THIS QUESTION THAT I'VE- GOT A LITTLE ABERRATION- IS ARE YOU WILLING TO LOOK AT MODERN. GIANT TECHNOLOGICAL TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES THROUGH A MAYBE NONTRADITIONAL. LANCE AND THE REASON I ASK THAT IS. A MULTI FACTORED- ONE IS WE'VE STARTED WE'VE SEEN AN INCREASE INTERESTS ABOVE THE FEDERAL LEVEL AND STATE LEVEL OF LOOKING AT SORT OF- THE POWER AND SIZE OF CERTAIN GIANT TECH COMPANIES MANY OF WHOM. WERE BORN AND BRED AND RAISED IN CALIFORNIA CALL CALIFORNIA HOME- WE ALSO HAVE A LONG TRADITION CALIFORNIA IT'S IN OUR- STATE CONSTITUTION THAT THERE'S A RIGHT TO PRIVACY- IT'S IMPORTANT. TO CALIFORNIANS TO HAVE PRIVACY- IN THEIR DATA IN THEIR HOMES. AND OTHER OTHER THINGS OF THAT NATURE- AND THERE'S BEEN LAWSUIT CERTAIN LAWSUITS BROUGHT BY ATTORNEYS GENERAL FROM. I THINK THAT'S THE RIGHT WAY TO SAY IT ATTORNEYS GENERAL. FROM ACTUALLY ALL FIFTY STATES- THE RECENTLY ALLEGING ANTI COMPETITIVE PRACTICES BUT CERTAIN COMPANIES- PUTS PERHAPS CALIFORNIA IN A BIT OF A HOT SEAT BECAUSE THESE ARE OUR COMPANIES- BUT I THINK IT'S RATHER IMPORTANT- CALIFORNIA BECAME IN DECEMBER THE LAST STATE ACTUALLY TO JOIN. THAT FIFTY STATE LAWSUIT- AND MANY PEOPLE HAVE ARGUED THAT ARE AN INTEREST LAWS BOTH FEDERAL AND STATE THE CARD RIGHT ACT AS THE STATE VERSION OR MAYBE. THIS THING RINGING LIKE CRAZY- ARE MAY BE IN NEED OF A CERTAIN DEGREE OF MODERNIZATION TO BETTER FIT THE BUSINESS MODELS OF THESE. COMPANIES FOR INSTANCE UNDER. THE SHERMAN AND CLAYTON ACTS OF FEDERAL LAW THE WAY YOU LOOK AT WHETHER COMPANIES A MONOPOLY. IS YOU LOOK AT THEIR MARKET POWER AND SIZE ONE INTO YOU LOOK AT WHETHER THEY'RE ABLE TO RAISE PRICES WITHOUT LOSING CUSTOMERS WELL THAT DOESN'T FIT REAL WELL WHEN. THE COMPANY'S OFFER PRODUCTS OR SERVICES FOR WHICH THEY DO NOT CHARGE ANYTHING IT IS A FREE PRODUCT AND SERVICE. AND THEY MAKE THEIR MONEY. AND A CONSIDERABLE GOBS OF IT AT THAT BY USING PEOPLE'S DATA AND USER DATA THAT THEY DERIVE THROUGH THE USE OF THAT PRODUCT. BOB SO I THINK WE'VE GONE FOR FORTY YEARS OR SO UNDER THE CHICAGO SCHOOL MODEL AND LOOKING AT. THE CHICAGO SCHOOL ECONOMICS WAY OF DEFINING A MONOPOLY. AND MAYBE OUR STATUTES NEED TO BE UPDATED MAYBE THEY NEED TO BE MODERNIZED. AND I SEE THAT IS AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT A CRITICAL ONE. OF CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SAFEGUARDING THAT PRIVACY THAT CALIFORNIANS EXPECT- IN THEIR DATA AND THEIR HOME IN THE USE OF THEIR DEVICES AND SO ON SO FORTH. SO LONG WINDED QUESTION BUT IT COMES DOWN TO ARE YOU OPEN TO EXAMINING WHETHER CALIFORNIA'S ANTI TRUST LAWS SHOULD BE REFORMED OR MODERNIZE ALONG THOSE LINES- AND MAYBE THERE MAYBE THERE ADEQUATE BUT IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE LOOKED AT. AND SECONDLY MORE GENERALLY WHAT ARE YOUR ROLE WHAT ARE YOUR VIEWS ON THE ROLE OF THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL. IN PROTECTING CONSUMER PRIVACY. THANK YOU. I THINK THAT THE IMPORTANT GOAL IS TO KEEP IN MIND OUR- BACK TO THAT FRAME I HAD ABOUT WHAT I THINK THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S ROLE IS. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S ROLE THIS TIME JERRY. IN A BROADLY SPEAKING PROTECT A LITTLE BACK. AGAINST OVERREACH AND ABUSE OF POWER BY THE BIG GUY. AND IT COULD TAKE A LOT OF FORMS- CERTAINLY- IF A COMPANY IS- OVERSTEPPING ITS ITS LEGAL AUTHORITY IF IT IS ENGAGE IN ANTI COMPETITIVE PRACTICES IT IS IF IT IS VIOLATING CONSUMER PRIVACY BECAUSE ABUSING CONSUMERS AND OTHER WAYS. AND IN VIOLATION OF THE LAW IT DOESN'T MATTER WHERE THEY'RE FROM OR HOW BIG THEY ARE- THE ATTORNEY GENERAL- AND IT SHOULD I HAVE THE HONOR OF BEING CONFIRMED SHOULD. TAKE ON. THAT COMPANY AND GO WITH A LAN FACTS TAKE THEM. IN SO. I THINK IT IS THE ROLE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO PROTECT CONSUMERS FROM ABUSE. BY ANY POWERFUL ABUSERS THAT COULD BE TECH COMPANIES IF THE LAW AND THE FACTS. ARE DETERMINED SO HERE THE POINT IS ABOUT ADVOCACY OF THE LAW ATTENTION NEED FOR MODERNIZATION. I THINK IT'S A REALLY INTERESTING INSIGHT YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY BEEN VERY THOUGHTFUL ABOUT THIS AND LOOK INTO THIS ISSUE- I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER. BUT I DO- I UNDERSTAND THE ARGUMENT THAT- BIG TECH COMPANIES THEIR BUSINESS MODELS THEIR BUSINESS APPROACHES. ARE DIFFERENT PERHAPS THAN OIL AND STILL COMPANIES FROM DECADES AGO. AND THE- ORIGINAL GOAL THAT WE HAD TO PROTECT CONSUMERS FROM PRICE GOUGING ANTI COMPETITIVE PRACTICES AND THE ABUSE OF MONOPOLIES- THAT SHOULD BE MAINTAINED THAT PROTECTION. AND I THINK IT WILL REQUIRE SOME ADDITIONAL THINKING AND COLLABORATING AROUND WHETHER IT'S NECESSARY AND IF SO WHAT THAT WOULD LOOK LIKE BUT I APPRECIATE YOUR OBSERVATION. THAT'S THAT'S ALL THE QUESTIONS I HAVEN'T THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THOSE ANSWERS I- I HOPE YOU KEEP THOSE THINGS IN MIND- I'D ASK THAT YOU DO AS YOU MOVE FORWARD INTO. WHAT I ANTICIPATE WILL BE A SUCCESSFUL. NEW DIRECTION. THANK YOU SENATE MEMBER CUNNINGHAM WE HAVE BEEN AT THIS FOR A LITTLE WHILE MOST OF BONTA I THINK WE OWE YOU A LITTLE BIT OF A BREAK BEFORE WE CONTINUE. SO WHAT ARE WE- TAKE FIVE OR TEN MINUTES AND GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO. RELAXER EVEN STATED FOR QUITE A TIME SO LET'S TAKE FIVE OR TEN MINUTES AND THEN WE'LL- THEN WE'LL WRAP UP IF THAT'S OKAY ITH YOU. ABSOLUTELY I'D FOR THE CHECK THANK YOU. SH WITH KOMBUCHA WE COME BACK TO ORDER. AND FINISH. OUR TASK HERE TODAY. SO NEXT I THINK THE CULTURE OF MR JONES SAWYER AND I HAVE A FEW FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS. AND THEN I WILL LOOK FOR A MOTION AND I WOULD THEN LIKE TO GIVE MR BONTA THE LAST WORD. BEFORE WE TAKE A VOTE AND THEN WRAP UP THAT'S THE PLAN SO THIS JONES SAWYER THANK YOU AND- THANK YOU MR BONTA UNITED CAME IN TOGETHER AND IN TWENTY TWELVE. AND WE'VE WE'VE DONE A LOT- I DON'T THINK MANY PEOPLE KNOW AND I JUST COULDN'T MAKE SURE A LOT OF THINGS ON THE RECORD. AND- LIKE YOU'RE YOU ARE ONE OFTHE FOUNDING FATHERS OF CANNABIS IN CALIFORNIA WITH THE BONTA. COOLEY JONES SAWYER BLACKIE AND WOOD WHERE ONCE THE ROAD TO THE LAWS FOR CANNABIS. SO IN THAT- APART THAT DISCUSSION THAT YOU HAD WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE HERE. I KNOW FROM ALL OF US THAT WORKED ON IT WE WANT TO GET RID OF THE ILLEGAL MARKET. AND I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE YOU. PEOPLE KNOW THAT YOU'RE NOT JUST COMMITTED TO IT BECAUSE IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO. BUT YOU ARE FULLY VESTED IN IT BECAUSE YOU STARTED. THE WHOLE THING. SO IF YOU JUST JUST LET US KNOW- AND I ALSO HAVE. TALKED WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL BEFORE. ABOUT GETTING THEM ENOUGH RESOURCES AND MONEY TO SHUT DOWN THE ILLEGAL MARKET. BY SHUTTING DOWN THEIR CASH FLOW. NOTHING IN THE JAIL- AND I KNOW I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO SAY THINGS LIKE ASSET FORFEITURE. BUT IF WE- TAKE AWAY LANDLORDS ASSETS WE GOING HERE AND TO START SHUTTING DOWN THE MARKET DOWN IN AND TAKING WHAT THEY USE TO MAKE THEIR PROFIT AWAY FROM THEM. I'VE BEEN LANDLORDS WOULD BE LESS. MMHM RIVERA RESISTED THE TO DO THAT SO I JUST WANTED YOU TO COMMENT ON THAT JUST REAL QUICK. MY COMMENT IS I AGREE WITH WITH WITH YOU WITH YOUR OBSERVATION. ACTUALLY THE POINT THAT- YOU KNOW. I'M COMMITTED TO THIS FROM BEGINNING TO END AND WE HELP WITH THE BEGINNING THAT WILL HELP CREATE THAT THE RULES AND REGULATIONS OF THE REGULATED MARKET PLACE AND I'M COMMITTED TO SEEING IT SUCCEED. ONE CRITICAL COMPONENT TO MAKE IT SUCCEED IS TO STOP THE PART THE ILLICIT MARKET PLACE FROM UNDERMINING THE REGULATED MARKET PLACE SO. AND I APPRECIATE YOUR PARTNERSHIP AROUND- RESOURCES IN YOUR- VALUES AROUND NOT PUTTING PEOPLE IN JAIL. BUT ANY LISTEN MARKETPLACE THROUGH OTHER MEANS. THANK YOU AND SO I WANT TO JUST MAKE SURE WE JUST REITERATE OF. ABOUT A FIFTY FIVE THINGS BAD APPS THAT APPLE'S BAD CITIES THAT DEPARTMENTS AND YOU JUST FASTER BOB THAT CANNABIS- AS YOU PROBABLY HEARD DESPITE FROM EVERYBODY HERE AND AS YOU KNOW WHEN WE GOT HERE. WE WERE TOLD BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL THAT THEY WOULD GET THEY WOULD FIX APPS GIVES ENOUGH TIMES AND WE WOULD FIX IT. AND SO WHAT I'M GOING TO ASK YOU IS NOT ONLY DO YOU MAKE A COMMITMENT TO FIX IT. BUT YOU GIVE US MEASURES OF SUCCESS ON HOW YOU'RE GOING TO FIX IT. SO THAT. AS I THINK YOU SAID IN WHEN YOUR STATEMENTS- YOU BELIEVE THAT WE CLEANED OFF. THE LIST BUT THEN MORE CAME IN- I DON'T THINK THIS LEGISLATURE KNEW THAT. INSTEAD BY THE TIME WE HEARD ABOUT WHAT WAS GOING ON AGAIN IT WAS AT THE SAME NUMBER SO THAT WAS KIND OF THE FRUSTRATION WE GAVE YOU TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS. THAT YOU GAVE AGES TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS THERE WAS SOME SUCCESS. BUT THEN THE BACKLOG CAME UP AGAIN. I THINK JUST JUST IF YOU MAKE A COMMITMENT. TO LET US KNOW EVERY STEP OF THE WAY OR ASSIGN SOMEBODY TO LET THIS LEGISLATURE NO. NOT ONLY WILL WE MAY EVEN GIVE MORE MONEY. BUT WE MAY BE ABLE TO TALK ABOUT- INNOVATIVE WAYS TO GET THIS DONE. AND WE CAN BE-PARTNERS IN EVENTUALLY LEARNING TO LISTEN BECAUSE WE HEAR A LOT FROM. OUR COLLEAGUES- MAY NOT BE SO- ENAMORED WITH GUN CONTROL. THAT WHY WE GOING AFTER THE BAD GUYS WELL THIS IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE LET'S GO AFTER THE BAD GUYS WITH GUNS. LET'S MAKE A VALIANT EFFORT TO GET THAT DONE SO. HOPEFULLY I GET YOUR COMMITMENT ON THAT. IT I. THANK TO WITH YOU TO THE APPS ISSUE- I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO HAVE METRICS- INTERNALLY IN THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND I HAVE THE HONOR OF BEING CONFIRMED AND ALSO. EXPRESSED TWO PARTNERS AND LEGISLATURE LIKE YOU CARE DEEPLY ABOUT THIS. I THINK ONE OF THE I THOUGHT SOME UNIQUE ABOUT ABOUT ME THAT'S BEEN MY GOOD FORTUNE IS THAT- MY PATHWAY. TO THIS NOMINATION HAS BEEN THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE. THROUGH WORKING WITH WITH YOU. ALL OF THE ARMENIAN PEOPLE IN OUR CLASS. BY THE NUMBERS ON THIS FLOOR ON THE OTHER FLOOR. AND I'VE LEARNED. SO MUCH FROM FROM MY COLLEAGUES I'VE I'VE SEEN THINGS DIFFERENTLY I'VE GROWN AS A LEADER. AND I APPRECIATE THE PARTNERSHIP AND- FROM MY PERSPECTIVE I DON'T WANT THAT PARTNERSHIP TO END. IF I AM CONFIRMED. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE WORK TOGETHER. ESPECIALLY WHEN WE HAVE A COMMON GOAL LIKE REDUCING. THE APPS LIST TO THE LOWEST AMOUNT POSSIBLE SO. I INVITE THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK TOGETHER TO IDENTIFY METRICS. AND TAB. I BE SUCCESSFUL AND HAVE US UNDERSTAND COMMUNICATE WITH ONE ANOTHER WHAT THAT SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE. J. AND THEN BAD APPLES ESPECIALLY IN IN LAW ENFORCEMENT- IT IS. IT HURTS THEM. MORE THAN IT IT HURTS US BECAUSE THE INTEGRITY. OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AS IT GOES DOWN- AND THEY START TO LOSE THAT- I THINK IT JUST. DISRUPTS THE WHOLE PUBLIC SAFETY SYSTEM. IT JUST MAKES IT A LITTLE MORE SKEWS SO- IF EVERYONE- LAW ENFORCEMENT DETAINEE GENERAL'S OFFICE. AND US IN THE LEGISLATURE. IF WE WORK REAL HARD TO AS YOU YOU SAID. WE'RE NOT LOOKING AT A LOT OF PEOPLE- BUT 1% OF ANY GROUP. COULD BECOME VERY PROBLEMATIC ONE PERCENT. OF A LEGISLATIVE BODY. THEN WE ALL GET PAINTED. WITH THE SAME BRUSH THAT THEY'RE ALL THAT WAY. AND SO WE BOTH. UNDERSTAND WHAT IT'S LIKE. TO BE IN. IN A BUBBLE AND HAVE PEOPLE LOOK AT A SO- I PURCHASED MY TO COMMIT THAT. WE AGGRESSIVE- GO AFTER AND PROSECUTE THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO MAY NOT SHOULD NOT FROM THE BEGINNING EVER BECOME LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS- AND THAT WE GET MORE PEACE OFFICERS IN SO WE JUST PROFESSIONAL ICE- THE ORGANIZATIONS. I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE A LAW ENFORCEMENT COMMUNITY THAT HAS THE TRUST OF. THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE AND THAT TAKES A DIFFERENT FORMS PART OF IT IS APPROPRIATE TRAINING AND SUPPORT- PART OF IT IS ACCOUNTABILITY. AND I KNOW YOU'RE PASSIONATE ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY SO MINE CANNOT CAN REALLY HELPS LEAD TO TRUST SO STANDING A BABY FIFTEEN OH SIX DECERTIFICATION- THOSE ARE IMPORTANT PART OF THAT CONVERSATION SO I AM COMMITTED TO GETTING. BUILDING THAT TRUST-BACK INTO LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THE COMMUNITY AND TAKING APPROPRIATE STEPS TO GET THERE. AND THEN UP. WHICH YOU MAY NOT KNOW WE HAVE BAD CITIES. AT THE LOWER SOUTHERN IN OF MY DISTRICT. YOU'VE HEARD OF BEFORE THE BELL BELL GARDENS AND JUST RECENTLY THERE WAS AN ARTICLE. ABOUT HUNTINGTON PARK WHICH IS A PART OF MY WHERE. THEY'RE THEY'RE OFFERING BUDGET FOR PERSONNEL IS FOURTEEN MILLION DOLLARS. BUT THE WHOLE FINANCE DEPARTMENT WAS RAIDED BY THE FBI BECAUSE THEY SENT IN EIGHT MILLION DOLLAR Y. TRANSFER. TO NEW YORK TO FOR GOD KNOWS WHAT- SO THAT OBVIOUSLY NO ACCOUNTABILITY BUT THIS IS BEEN GOING ON FOR ALL THOSE CRESCENT CITIES BECAUSE OF THE CORRUPT CRESCENT MOON- BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN SO MANY. CITIES DOWN THERE AND ALMOST LIKE IN A BUBBLE AND NOBODY THE DA'S OFFICE- ORDER. OR EVEN FBI OR EVEN THE AG'S OFFICE HAVE PUT IN RESOURCES SO BEFORE YOUR PREDECESSOR LEFT- I OFFERED HIM. AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO GIVE THEM MORE MONEY AND RESOURCES TO ACTUALLY GO IN THERE BECAUSE- LOOK THEY'RE STEALING MONEY FOR. FOR LATINO AFRICAN AMERICAN PEOPLE JUST JUST BEFORE THEY THEY- THEY CAN'T COME TO A MEETING LIKE THIS. AND THERE'S LOCAL CITY COUNCIL THEY GOTTA WORK. AND SO THEY CAN'T KEEP AN EYE ON- PEOPLE WHO ARE ROBBING THE CITY BLIND. SOMETIMES TWENTY MEAN HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WITH THE DEBT AND THEY HIDE BECAUSE- NO ONE'S REALLY MAKING A VALIANT EFFORT AND SO I WOULD HOPE. WORKING WITH THE DA'S OFFICE- IN LOS ANGELES WE CAN FINALLY PUT JUSTICE CORRUPT PRESIDENT OUT OF BUSINESS BECAUSE IT'S JUST NOT IT IT JUST ALSO MAKE PEOPLE NOT TRUST GOVERNMENT. AND ALL SO HOPEFULLY YOU CAN COME UP WITH SOME SOME WAYS TO DO THAT I'VE ALSO OFFER THE TWO DID NOT LIKE. THAT TO SEE IF WE HAVE SURPLUS. AFTER WE NEED TO PUT MORE MONEY IN THOSE DIRECTIONS AND IN CITIES. THAT WE KNOW. ARE ARE HAVING REAL FINANCIAL. PROBLEMS CORRUPTION. THANK YOU FOR IDENTIFYING THAT THAT HAS ISSUE OF BETWEEN PEOPLE IN THE GOVERNMENT OF THE THAT'S RIGHT. AND IT'S A RISK COURSE WHEN THERE'S PUBLIC CORRUPTION WHEN THERE'S MISUSE OF PUBLIC FUNDS WHEN THERE'S EMBEZZLEMENT. I DIDN'T THINK THAT YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT IT IS AN AREA OF OVERLAPPING SURE JURISDICTION AS YOU IDENTIFY WITH DA'S HAVING JURISDICTION THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AS WELL. AND I'D LIKE TO SEE WHAT OUR OPERATION LOOKS LIKE IN THE DEPARTMENT JUSTICE IF I HAVE THE HONOR OF BEING CONFIRMED AND SEEING HOW WE CAN BE PART. OF ROOTING OUT PUBLIC CORRUPTION IN CALIFORNIA AS WELL INCLUDING IN THE AREAS THAT YOU'VE DISCUSSED. THANK YOU AND- THE LAST THING IS- WE GOT CLEAN OUR OWN HOUSE- YOU KNOW- I KNOW THAT THE AG'S OFFICE. YEARS HOPEFULLY SOON TO BE YOUR OFFICE. HAS BEEN WORKING WITH ALL THE AS ACROSS THE STATE- ON D. E. D. D. PROBLEM. SLASH CDC ARE PROBLEMS. OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. THAT HAVE BEEN DEFRAUDED- FROM FROM THE GOVERNMENT. AND WHEN YOU WHEN YOU GET DOWN IN THE PROBLEM YOU WONDER NOT ONLY WHAT WAS GOING ON IN THE OUTSIDE. BUT EVIDENTLY. SOME OF OUR EMPLOYEES MAY HAVE BEEN INVOLVED AND I HOPE THAT WE JUST DON'T. JUST DON'T. I DON'T OVERLOOK IT. LET IT GO BY COULD YOU CAN GET THE MONEY BACK OR WHATEVER- BUT THAT WE SERIOUSLY LOOK AT WHO DEFRAUDED US THAT WE FULLY GO AFTER WHETHER THEY WERE IN CDCR. WHETHER D. THAT WE GO AFTER THAT CORRUPTION WE CLEAN UP OUR OWN HOUSE. OUR OWN HOUSE AND MAKE IT CLEAR THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO STAND FOR IT ANYMORE A LOT OF TIMES GOVERNMENTS TRY TO SWEEP IT UNDER THE RUG. BECAUSE IT'S EMBARRASSING IT IS EMBARRASSING. BUT I ALSO BELIEVE IF YOU PROSECUTE PEOPLE WHO DO MALFEASANCE AND FRAUD IN GOVERNMENT. IS SEND A MESSAGE TO THE OTHERS DID NOT DO IT AND SO HOPE I GET YOUR COMMITMENT TO ALSO- AND I KNOW YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE THE ATTORNEY FOR US. HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND WHAT IS CONSTITUTIONALLY OR- ITS BUYOUT. TALK PRACTICE OF POLICY BUT YOU ARE TECHNICALLY OUR LAWYER WHEN YOU COME A G. BUT WE ALSO NEED SOMEONE THAT CAN KEEP US IN CHECK. I THINK IT'S ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE THAT- THESE FUNDS THAT ARE MEANT FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO PAY THEIR NEXT MONTH'S RENT OR THE BUTTON ON THEIR TABLE WHO DESPERATELY ARE IN NEED OF A EASY CHECK IT THAT IT'S BEEN THE STOLEN THAT'S BEEN DEFRAUDED THESE ARE ALSO PUBLIC TAX DOLLARS TAXPAYERS MONEY THAT'S BEEN- STILL STOLEN AND MISUSED. AND FROM MY UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT IS HAPPENING THERE ARE TRANS NATIONAL CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIONS INVOLVED AND IT INVOLVES I THINK A MULTI JURISDICTIONAL STRATEGY- WORKING WITH THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S WHO WHO ARE WORKING ON THIS WORKING WITH OTHER STATES OTHER STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL- PERHAPS THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO DO THAT INVESTIGATION AND I DO THE BEST WE CAN TO- RECOVER IN RECOUP- THE FACT THAT STATE TAXPAYER DOLLARS AND ALL GO WHEREVER. ON THIS ISSUE OVER THE LONG THE FAX LEAD- I'M NOT AWARE OF GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES BEING INVOLVED BUT I'LL GO WHEREVER THE FACTS IN THE LEAD AND GET TO THE BOTTOM OF IT GET TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS HAPPENING. AND- TRY TO REMEDY THIS THE HORRIBLE- VIOLATION OF TRUST AND AFTER THESE CRITICAL TAXPAYER DOLLARS THAT SHOULD BE IN THE POCKETS OF. CALIFORNIANS IN NEED. YOU'LL YOU'LL FIND IT GOES IS PRETTY PERVASIVE AND THROUGHOUT. STATE GOVERNMENT SO. THE VISION ABOUT THAT THANK YOU THANK YOU. RIGHT THANK YOU MISTER JONES SAWYER- MISS BONTA JUST TO A FEW MORE QUESTIONS REALLY KIND OF CLARIFICATION AND I THINK WHAT'S TRUE IS MOST OF THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE ASKED WERE INDIVIDUAL INTERESTS OF LEGISLATORS. BUT I THINK A LOT OF COMMON INTEREST FOR MOST OF THIS. PERFECT NOT TO BEAT A DEAD HORSE BUT THE IT'S LIKE THE APPS PROCESS AND THE FRUSTRATION THAT SITTING ON SOME FIVE WE'VE HAD AS WE TRY. TO PUSH THAT ISSUE AND YET THE REALITY IS WE WE'RE HEARING THOSE OF US. ESPECIALLY IN IN SO WITH SOME RURAL DISTRICTS. CARING DIFFERENT THINGS FROM SHERIFF'S AND IN AND LOCAL POLICE OFFICERS ABOUT. THEIR INVOLVEMENT IN TRYING TO GET GUNS OUT OF PEOPLE'S HANDS AND SO THE NOTION OF COMMUNICATING WITH THE LOCAL AGENCIES IN PROVIDING SOME SUPPORT AND SOME HELP I THINK IT'S IT IS REALLY A KEY ONE THERE BUT JUST A- COUPLE OF CLARIFICATIONS AND YOU HAD MENTIONED. THE SENATE BILL FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE WHERE WE WERE TRYING TO MAKE IT CLEAR ON THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC RECORDS ACT. THAT WE WANTED INFORMATION TO HELP. LAW ENFORCEMENT ACCOUNTABLE AND YOUR PREDECESSOR TOOK THE- I TOOK THE POSITION THAT I THINK I THINK INCORRECTLY THAT IT APPLIED ONLY TO CURRENT EVENTS OR TO FUTURE RECORDS AS OPPOSED TO REALLY GOING INTO THE DATA ABOUT POLICE MISCONDUCT BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THE BILL WANTED TO DO. AND IT REALLY BEGS THE QUESTION. YOU NOW IF YOU GET THIS CONFIRMATION WILL BE IN DOING AN ADMINISTRATIVE ROLE WE BEING LEGISLATIVE AND NOT TO UNDERMINE. THE SEPARATION OF POWERS HERE. BUT HOW HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT WHAT THE LAWS THAT WE PASS AND WE FEEL ARE FAIRLY CLEAR. THAT WE CAN COMMUNICATE THAT WITH YOU AND I THINK IT IS VERY FRUSTRATING FOR US WHEN IN ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENT. TAKES A COUNTER. INTERPRETATION OF THE STATUTE NOT BASED ON THE WORDS OF THE STATUTE BUT IT'S WOULD BE BASED ON. ANOTHER DESIRE HOW DO WE SORT THAT. LET ME TRY TO ANSWER SPECIFICALLY FIRST AND GENERALLY SECOND WHEN IT COMES TO SB FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE. AS PART OF THAT BILL- IT WAS A BILL WHOSE LETTER AND INTENT WAS FOR DISCLOSURE OF ADDITIONAL PERSONAL RECORDS PERSON PURSUANT TO THAT THE CATEGORIES. ANIMATED IN THAT IN THAT LAW. AND. HI IF I HAVE THE HONOR OF BEING CONFIRMED I HOPE TO BE ABLE TO EXECUTE ON THAT DISCLOSURE PURSUANT TO LINE CARRY OUT THE LAW. THERE THERE WERE SOME. RUSSIANS ABOUT WHETHER. IT WAS APPLIED TO PROSPECTIVE RECORDS ONLY VERSUS RETROSPECTIVE WHETHER IT APPLIED TO. DOCUMENTS THAT THAT WERE ARE CREATED- AN ACTUAL DOJ DOCUMENTS OR DOCUMENTS IN THE POSSESSION OF THE DOJ THAT WERE THIRD PARTY DOCUMENTS THAT'S ALL CLEARED UP NOW AS I UNDERSTAND IT SO OR OR OR CLOSER TO DISCLOSURE. AND THAT'S THE INTENT OF THE BILL OF LAW AND THAT'S WHAT I WILL SEEK TO BE- PARTICIPATING IN DISCLOSING THE BILL'S PURSUANT TO THAT LAW. GENERALLY SOMETIMES WE WRITE BILLS AS LEGISLATORS AND I'VE DONE THIS- WHERE WE THINK WE HAVE A TAPE AND IT HAS ALL THE COMPONENTS OF THE GUIDANCE NEEDED AND THE SOMETHING THAT I JUST NEVER THOUGHT OF. AND WHEN THE AGENCY OR DEPARTMENT RESPONSIBLE FOR IMPLEMENTING- SEES THE BILL THERE'S SOMETHING THAT AN ANTENNA CONSEQUENCE OR AMBIGUITY OR LACK OF CLARITY I THINK I HOPE I BELIEVE THAT WE CAN AVOID THAT. IF WE'RE ENGAGED EARLIER MEANING IF THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE'S LEGISLATIVE TEAM ARE WORKING WITH LEGISLATORS CARRYING BILLS THAT IMPACT APARTMENT JUSTICE TO- YOU KNOW PROVIDE INPUT TO PROVIDE SUGGESTIONS TO POINT OUT AREAS THAT COULD CREATE THAT AND BEGIN AMBIGUITY OR THAT UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES THAT WE HAVE PUT IT ON THE FRONT END. INSTEAD OF BEING FRUSTRATED ON THE BACKEND. NINETY AND I APPRECIATE THAT IN AND- YOU DID RIGHT GOOD ANSWER ON ON SPECIFICALLY THE FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE BUT IS USING THAT IS A BIT OF AN EXAMPLE BECAUSE I THINK IT JUST SEEMS LIKE. THE PREDECESSOR. I WANTED AN OUTCOME. BUT WAS FRUSTRATING ULTIMATELY TO WHAT THE PURPOSE OF DISCLOSURE. AND TRANSPARENCY. THAT WAS EMBODIED IN IN IN THE BILL AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN FIGURE OUT. WAYS TO OVERCOME THOSE. THOSE DIFFERENCES I HAVE BEEN CHASTISED BY JUDGES. WHO TELL US THAT OUR JOB IS TO WRITE CLEAR LAW YOU HAVE TO EXPLAIN TO THEM. THAT'S NOT REALLY OUR JOB OUR JOB IS TO PASS THE LAW THAT THE BEST WAY WE CAN. GIVEN THE DYNAMICS THIRTY PEOPLE TO SIT ON THE SCHOOL. AND WE ARE NOT ALWAYS GOING TO BE AS CLEAR AND WE ARE GOING TO NEGOTIATE OVER SOME VERY SPECIFIC SO YOUR POINT IS WELL TAKEN. THAT THE ULTIMATE THE INTERPRETATION WAR SOMETHING THAT IS NOT COMPLETELY CLEAR AS WE NEGOTIATE PRETTY HEAVILY SOME OF THESE BILLS. CAN BE A CHALLENGE BUT I HOPE THAT GIVEN YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF OUR PROCESSES AND WHAT WE DO. THAT WE CAN HAVE SOME LINES OF COMMUNICATION TO CLEAR THINGS UP. SO THAT THERE'S NOT ALL TO MILLION FRUSTRATION. AT THE END ON THE ISSUE OF. PUBLIC TRUST KIND OF ACCOUNTABILITY AND THINGS IN THIS IS SOMETHING THAT. THAT IS IMPORTANT THAT. AND WHEN THE QUESTIONS THAT THAT I. **** I THINK THAT THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT CONFLICT THAT IS DEVELOPED OVER THE YEARS. AND THAT IS WITH LOCAL DJS AND EVEN WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE. TAKING CAMPAIGN MONEY AS IS. TRADITIONAL FROM ORGANIZATIONS IN AND FOR US BECAUSE OF OUR LEGISLATIVE ROLE THERE'S NOT NECESSARILY A DIRECT AS AS DIRECTOR CONNECTION GOOD FOR DISTRICT ATTORNEY OR FOR EVEN THE ATTORNEY GENERAL HAVING SPECIFIC DISCIPLINARY RESPONSIBILITY OVER A GROUP THAT IS GIVING CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS I THINK THIS POTENTIAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST AND I JUST WANNA GET YOUR TAKE DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT DO YOU. DISAGREE WITH THAT. AS I MENTIONED EARLIER I REALLY BELIEVE THAT ONE OF THAT THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT AND PRESSING ISSUES THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS WHEN IT COMES TO LAW ENFORCEMENT AND COMMUNITIES BUILDING THAT TRUST BACK BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND OUR COMMUNITIES. AND THE BILL- THE CONCEPT THAT YOU REFER TO. SPECIFICALLY THAT A DISTRICT ATTORNEY WHO HAS CRIMINAL CHARGING POWER THAT IS VERY UNIQUE AMONG ELECTED OFFICIALS. IF THEY RECEIVE A CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION FROM A POLICE UNION AND THEN ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR AN INVESTIGATION OF A MEMBER OF THE POLICE UNION A POLICE OFFICER- THEN THEY CAN- EITHER NOT. WE CAN PROCEED WITH THE INVESTIGATION IF THEY'RE NOT TAKING- DIVERSITY CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION OR THEY WOULD BE RECUSED IF THEY WERE- IF ACCEPTING THAT CONTRIBUTION I THINK THAT THAT WAS A PROPOSAL THAT I- CAME FORWARD WITH. TO HELP ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF REBUILDING COMMUNITY TRUST BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THE COMMUNITY I'VE HAD. PEOPLE COME UP TO ME AND SAY. HOW CAN THEY BE A MAKE AN OBJECTIVE DECISION. ON THIS ON THIS POLICE OFFICER. ON WHETHER THEY USED EXCESSIVE FORCE OR- YOU KNOW- YOU KNOW VIOLATED EIGHTY TO NINETY TWO. WHEN THAT WHEN THAT UNION HAS GIVEN A CONTRIBUTION TO THAT DISTRICT ATTORNEY AND SO. THAT WAS A CLEAR INDICATION TO ME THAT THAT TRUST IS MISSING. AND MY HOPE IS THAT THAT BILL WOULD HELP RESTORE THAT TRUST. AND I AGREE AND I KNOW YOU GOT WE GOT SOME PUSH BACK. FROM THE ATTORNEY GENERAL ON THAT SO I AM GLAD. THAT YOU ARE PROPOSED FOR THIS POSITION UNDERSTAND THAT ISSUE BECAUSE I THINK IT IS CLEAR IT DOES NOT MESS IN MY VIEW DOES NOT MEAN THAT THERE'S A CONFLICT. THAT POTENTIAL CONFLICTS. AND ACTUAL CONFLICT SOMETIMES THAT DRIVES OUTCOMES. IS DETRIMENTAL TO BUILDING TRUST CONFIDENCE KIND OF ACROSS THE BOARD- AND THEN IN MY FINAL COMMENT TO IT IN I KNOW YOU UNDERSTAND THIS ISSUE THIS IS BEEN RAISED A LITTLE BITON THE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ISSUE CALIFORNIA THIS IS SOMETHING WE STRUGGLED WITH. QUITE A BIT I THINK THAT CALIFORNIA HAS LED THE NATION FOR DECADES ON ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY ENVIRONMENTAL ENFORCEMENT. I THINK THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S. OFFICE HAS DONE A GREAT JOB ON ENVIRONMENTAL FOR- ENVIRONMENTAL. ENFORCEMENT OF OUR LAWS HOWEVER THE PIECE THAT IS REALLY THE TO ME THE NEXT GENERATION STEP THAT WE NEED TO TAKE IS ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE BECAUSE IF WE JUST ENFORCE THE ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS THE WAY WE HAVE WE KNOW THAT WE'RE LEAVING COMMUNITIES BEHIND. AND YET IN AGGREGATE CALIFORNIA'S CLEAN AIR CLEAN WATER ARE EXEMPLARY BUT IF YOU DRILL DOWN AND LOOK AT SPECIFIC COMMUNITIES THAT IS NOT THE CASE. SO WHAT I'M HOPING IS THAT INSTEAD SHE GIVEN YOUR EXPERTISE YOUR BACKGROUND AND YOUR SENSITIVITY TO SEE ISSUES. IS THAT. THAT'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE WHAT HAS BEEN EXEMPLARY ENVIRONMENTAL ENFORCEMENT. AND RECAST IT AS NECESSARY AS IS NECESSARY WITH MORE OF AN ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE LANDS SO THAT THAT BECOMES WHAT THE ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM THE PRIMARY DRIVER TO BEHIND THE FORCING MECHANISM BECAUSE I THINK TAT IS. A LONG STANDING DEFICIT IN HOW WE HAVE VIEWED ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY ALL THE TIME THOSE COMMUNITIES OF LOS AND THEY WILL CONTINUE TO LOSE SO I AM JUST ASKING THAT YOU WHICH YOU HAVE SAID BUT THIS IS I THINK A VERY VERY IMPORTANT. ISSUE THAT THAT WE LOOK AT ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY ESPECIALLY BERMAN FORTRESS- DEPARTMENTAL ENFORCEMENT THROUGH THAT EQUITY LENS THROUGH THAT JUSTICE LET. BECAUSE I THINK THAT LEADS US TO DIFFERENT CONCLUSIONS AND POTENTIALLY DIFFERENT PRIORITIES IF. 100% YEAH GOOD AND I JUST REALLY APPRECIATE LEADERSHIP INTHIS HOUSE- YOU SOME OF OUR QUE HAN LAUGHTER VERY SIMILAR QUESTION. WITH THE SAME CONCERN ASSEMBLY MEMBER CRISTINA GARCIA EDUARDO GARCIA WE HAVE REALLY PUT A STAKE IN THE GROUND ON THE IMPORTANCE OF NOT JUST DEFENDING PROTECTING OUR ENVIRONMENT AS YOU MENTIONED BY ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE- MAKING SURE THAT THOSE. AT THE INTERSECTION OF POVERTY POLLUTION DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES ARE SEEN AND PRIORITIZED AND- AT THE SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES BEST SET UP WHEN HE WAS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. I HAD THE FORESIGHT AND VISION AND VALUES TO CREATE THE BUREAU ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE WHERE THOSE VALUES THAT LANDS IS EMPHASIZED AND PRIORITIZED. IN HIS HOUSE AND I WANT TO BUILD ON THE THAT HIS VISION AND HIS VALUES AND CONTINUE THAT WORK WITH THE EQUITY LINES THAT YOU. MENTIONED WHICH WHICH I HAVE EVERY CONFIDENCE IN WHICH IS WHY IT WASN'T REALLY A QUESTION. BUT I. AM JUST EXCITED ABOUT THE POSSIBILITIES AND THEN BECOME. PERVASIVE AND WHAT THE OFFICE OF ATTORNEY GENERAL IN HOW THAT OFFICE VIEWS ITS ENFORCEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES- CROSS THE BORDER IS THROUGH THAT. EQUITY LEFT.
