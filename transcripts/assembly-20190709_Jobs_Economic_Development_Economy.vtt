01:19:31.967 --> 01:19:34.136
RANKING -- CRITERIA FOR THE

01:19:34.202 --> 01:19:36.838
REVIEW OF ANY APPLICATIONS WHAT

01:19:36.905 --> 01:19:37.706
ARE YOU ENVISIONING AS A

01:19:37.772 --> 01:19:40.075
PROGRAMS PRIORITIES -- AND

01:19:40.142 --> 01:19:46.448
EVALUATION CRITERIA.

01:19:46.515 --> 01:19:48.850
OF THE THE MAIN THING IS THAT

01:19:48.917 --> 01:19:51.253
NEEDS TO BE A NEW EVENT --

01:19:51.319 --> 01:19:52.854
THAT'S COMING OR IT NEEDS TO BE

01:19:52.921 --> 01:19:54.189
ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE --

01:19:54.256 --> 01:19:56.158
SIGNIFICANT AKRON INCREMENTAL

01:19:56.224 --> 01:19:58.527
VALUE SO EVEN IF IT IS A AN

01:19:58.593 --> 01:20:02.397
EVENT THAT IS PERHAPS BàN.

01:20:02.464 --> 01:20:02.964
IN A SMALLER CITY COULD BE

01:20:03.031 --> 01:20:03.632
GILROY.

01:20:03.698 --> 01:20:05.033
GARLIC VESSEL JUST USING AS AN

01:20:05.100 --> 01:20:08.436
EXAMPLE IF THEY WANT TO INCREASE

01:20:08.503 --> 01:20:10.138
IT SO THAT IT IS GOING TO BE

01:20:10.205 --> 01:20:11.940
AGAIN GENERATE SIGNIFICANT --

01:20:12.007 --> 01:20:13.808
TRUCK NEW BUSINESS FROM OUT OF

01:20:13.875 --> 01:20:15.977
STATE INTO STATE -- THAT WOULD

01:20:16.044 --> 01:20:18.013
HELP QUALIFY IT IT CERTAINLY CAN

01:20:18.079 --> 01:20:20.115
BE A MAJOR EVENT THAT IS GOT

01:20:20.182 --> 01:20:22.083
PROVEN ECONOMIC IMPACT THERE

01:20:22.150 --> 01:20:23.418
WILL NEED TO BE A STUDY DONE

01:20:23.485 --> 01:20:25.487
AHEAD OF TIME OR PROJECTION OF

01:20:25.554 --> 01:20:26.087
FORECAST.

01:20:26.154 --> 01:20:27.556
OF WHAT THAT ECONOMIC BENEFIT

01:20:27.622 --> 01:20:29.024
WOULD BE AND THEN AT THE

01:20:29.090 --> 01:20:30.325
CONCLUSION OF THE EVENT

01:20:30.392 --> 01:20:34.062
OBVIOUSLY THERE WOULD BE A POST --

01:20:34.129 --> 01:20:35.697
SERVICE THIS STUDY DONE AS WELL.

01:20:35.764 --> 01:20:37.465
THANK YOU AND ARE JUST AN

01:20:37.532 --> 01:20:39.067
ADDITIONAL QUESTION HOW DO YOU

DO YOU SEE A FOR SMALLER

01:20:47.676 --> 01:20:49.444
COMMUNITIES WHERE YOU'RE ABLE TO

01:20:49.511 --> 01:20:51.947
HAVE A REGIONAL EVENT -- SUCH AS

01:20:52.013 --> 01:20:54.182

BENEFIT OF ALL COMMUNITIES IN

01:20:59.421 --> 01:21:00.922
CALIFORNIA BUT IN PARTICULAR

01:21:00.989 --> 01:21:02.791
SMALLER COMMUNITIES SO --

01:21:02.857 --> 01:21:04.125
CALIFORNIA IS A LOT OF NATURAL

01:21:04.192 --> 01:21:06.294
ADVANTAGES WHEN WE'RE COMPETING

SHAKESPEARE FESTIVAL.

01:21:10.799 --> 01:21:12.934
BUT IF THE COMMUNITY FOR EXAMPLE

01:21:13.001 --> 01:21:14.269
HERE IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA

01:21:14.336 --> 01:21:15.737
WANTED TO COMPETE WITH THE STATE

01:21:15.804 --> 01:21:17.339
OF OREGON FOR THE SHAKESPEARE

01:21:17.405 --> 01:21:18.607
FESTIVAL WHICH WOULD BE A NEW

01:21:18.673 --> 01:21:21.142
ENTERPRISE -- IN A SMALLER

01:21:21.209 --> 01:21:21.710
COMMUNITY COULD HAVE BEEN A

01:21:21.776 --> 01:21:22.844
GREATER.

01:21:22.911 --> 01:21:24.045
IMPACT AT LEAST --

01:21:24.112 --> 01:21:25.714
PROPORTIONATELY TO SMALLER

01:21:25.780 --> 01:21:27.182
COMMUNITIES SO MY VISION IS THAT

01:21:27.249 --> 01:21:28.950
THIS WOULD BE PARTICULARLY

01:21:29.017 --> 01:21:31.653

COMMUNITIES ONE THAT HAS MOVED

01:21:42.530 --> 01:21:43.465
FROM WHAT WOULD WOULD HAVE BEEN

01:21:43.531 --> 01:21:44.666
CONSIDERED A SMALL COMMUNITY TO

01:21:44.733 --> 01:21:46.167
A NICE MID SIZE CITY NOW.

01:21:46.234 --> 01:21:47.469
AND IT WAS EXACTLY BECAUSE OF

01:21:47.535 --> 01:21:49.337

01:22:00.815 --> 01:22:01.950
SIZED TOWNS AND THEY'RE LOOKING

01:22:18.099 --> 01:22:19.601
VIRTUALLY ANY PLACE IN THE

01:22:19.668 --> 01:22:20.502
COUNTRY.

POINT IN TIME -- ALAN JO JUMP IN

BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT

01:23:10.919 --> 01:23:12.887
WILL IT THE THE THAT WILL

01:23:12.954 --> 01:23:14.789

HAVE TO HAVE AN ONGOING

01:23:20.762 --> 01:23:22.063

I MEAN IDEALLY -- YOU KNOW THE

01:23:31.673 --> 01:23:33.141
STATE WOULD GET BEHIND ONE

01:23:33.208 --> 01:23:34.676
APPLICANTS SO IT WOULD HAVE TO

01:23:34.743 --> 01:23:36.544
EVALUATE THOSE COMPETING

01:23:36.611 --> 01:23:37.979
APPLICATIONS. TO START.

01:23:38.046 --> 01:23:39.614
I CAN ONLY SPEAK TO MY OWN

01:23:39.681 --> 01:23:42.083
VISION MY OWN VISION WOULD BE IF

01:23:42.150 --> 01:23:44.052
FOR EXAMPLE ONE OF THE LARGEST

01:23:44.119 --> 01:23:45.520

WITH. FOR EXAMPLE A SMALLER

01:23:49.190 --> 01:23:51.326
LOCATION IT WOULD BE MY PERSONAL

01:23:51.393 --> 01:23:53.695
POINT OF VIEW -- THIS IS NOT THE

01:23:53.762 --> 01:23:54.696
WORK OUT MY PERSONAL POINT OF

IMPACT IN THE SMALLER COMMUNITY.

01:24:00.235 --> 01:24:02.103
MEANS THE THAT THE STATE HAS A

01:24:02.170 --> 01:24:07.709
GREATER INTEREST IN LOCATING

01:24:07.776 --> 01:24:08.209
THAT OF AND THE SMALLER

01:24:08.276 --> 01:24:09.577
