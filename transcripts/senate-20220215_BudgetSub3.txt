CSK WAS CHARGED WITH IMPLEMENTING A TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND JUST SPECIFICALLY PROVIDE UPDATES ON BOTH THE CALIFORNIA REGION PAYMENT PROGRAM. AND THE FEDERAL LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLD WATER SYSTEMS PROGRAM. THE PRIMARY FOCUS OF CSP'S THE ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF PROGRAMS THE SERVANT UP LEFT THE LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS. LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES HAVE EXPERIENCED A DISPROPORTION FINANCIAL IMPACT DURING THE CODE NINETEEN PANDEMIC. THROUGHOUT THIS PAST YEAR TUESDAY'S BEEN FOCUSING ON SUPPORTING THE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT OPERATE THE DEPARTMENT'S PROGRAMS AS THEY HAVE ADAPTED TO THE CHANGES BROUGHT ON BY THE PANDEMIC. THESE LOCAL LEVEL ADAPTIONS ADAPTATIONS INCLUDE COMMUNITY SERVICE BLOCK GRANT AGENCIES THE SUPPORT FOOD BANKS THAT PIVOTED TO FOOD DROP OFFS AND HOME DELIVERY. AND THE DISTRIBUTION OF PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT THE FARMERS ASSISTANCE PROGRAM AGENCIES CREATED NEW WAYS TO DEVELOP IN HOME EMERGENCY AND WEATHER IS ATION SERVER. YEAH I'M PROUD OF HOW CSP AND ITS NETWORK IS ADAPTED TO MEET THESE CHALLENGES FEDERALLY FUNDED FUNDING COMES PRIMARILY FROM THREE FEDERAL GRANTS. TO COMMUNITY SERVICE BLOCK GRANT OR CDBG. THE LOW INCOME HOME ENERGY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM FOR LIGHT HEAT. AND THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY'S WEATHER IS THE WEATHER IS ATION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. CURRENTLY THE LARGER C. S. B. G. UNLIKE IT GRANTS ARE BEING FUNDED UNDER FEDERAL CONTINUING RESOLUTION. IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE CALIFORNIA RECEIVED SIXTY SIX MILLION FOR C. S. B. G. ONE HUNDRED NINETY NINE MILLION FOR LIKE EIGHT. EIGHT MILLION FOR THE DEAL WE WEATHER RESISTANT WEATHER STATION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM UNDER THE REGULAR ANNUAL GRANTS DISTRIBUTED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. BOB CST WON'T HAVE FINAL WORDS UNTIL THE FEDERAL BUDGET PROCESS HAS CONCLUDED. FUNDING FOR THE REGULAR ANNUAL GRANTS HAVE BEEN RELATIVELY STABLE OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS. THAT'S SAD OVER THE COURSE OF THE COVERT NINETEEN BENJAMIN CST IS SEEN A SIGNIFICANT INFLUX OF SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING AS FEDERAL GOLF DOLLARS OF AUGMENTED REGULAR FUNDING LEVELS. UNDER BOTH THE CONSOLIDATED APPROPRIATIONS. I WOULD KNOW FOR THE PUBLIC THAT WE ARE EXPERIENCING SOME TECHNICAL DIFFERENCE DIFFICULTIES. HOLD ON ONE SECOND DIRECTOR.

CST IS A MASTER THIS GRANT SINCE TWENTY SIXTEEN. THIS IS LOW INCOME WEATHERIZATION PROGRAM OR LIE WHAT IS CURRENTLY FUNDED WITH A MIX OF CAP AND TRADE AUCTION PROCEEDS IN GENERAL FUND DOLLARS. WHY WOULD AS A CALVARY CLIMB INVESTOR PROGRAM THAT IS PRICED AT THAT AS THE PRIMARY GOAL OF REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS IS THE ONLY PROGRAM OF ITS KIND IN CALIFORNIA FOCUSING EXCLUSIVELY ON SERVING LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. WITH NO COST SOLAR PEAVEY SYSTEMS AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY UPGRADES. TWO COMPONENTS OF WHY WHAT ARE CURRENTLY IN OPERATION. THE FARM WORKER HOUSING COMPONENT WHICH SERVES LOW INCOME FARMWORKER HOUSING AND THE MULTI FAMILY COMPONENT WHICH SERVICES MULTI FAMILY AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE CEST RECEIVED TWENTY FIVE MILLION FROM FROM THE GENERAL FUND TO SUPPORT THE FARMWORKER HOUSING COMPONENT WITH FIFTEEN MILLION APPROPRIATED FROM THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND.

FINALLY THIS IS IN THE PROCESS OF IMPLEMENTING A NEW THREE MILLION DOLLAR PROGRAM FOR GRANTS TO COUNTIES TO ESTABLISH FARMWORKER RESOURCE CENTERS. SHE IS THE ONLY HAS ONE B. C. B. THIS YEAR AND THE BASIC YOUR QUEST THE SHIFT OF SEVEN FULL TIME POSITIONS FROM THE DEPARTMENT'S TEMPORARY HELP LIKE IT. DIDN'T APARTMENTS PERMANENT POSITION OF AUTHORITY. REQUEST PROVIDED TRUE OF THE POSITION OF FORTY TO REFLECT POSITION USAGE MORE ACCURATELY WITHIN DEPARTMENT BASED ON MY JAVADI TENURE AND WORKLOAD. THERE IS NO FUNDING ASSOCIATED WITH THIS REQUEST BECAUSE IT'S A SHIFT THE POSITION. OF AUTHORITY WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT'S EXISTING BUDGET. IT TWENTY TWENTY ONE CEST WAS ALSO GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO IMPLEMENT TWO MAJOR NEW PROGRAMS. FIRST THE CALIFORNIA RIDGE PAYMENT PROGRAM OR CAP. WHICH IS MEANT TO ADDRESS THE HISTORIC LEVELS OF ENERGY BILL THAT CALIFORNIA'S ACCRUED DURING THE CODE NINETEEN PANDEMIC. SECOND THE FEDERAL LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLD WATER SYSTEMS PROGRAM WERE LIGHT WALK WHICH WILL PROVIDE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS TO REDUCE WATER AND WASTE WATER DEBT. ACCRUED AS A RESULT OF THE CALIFORNIA NINETEEN PANDEMIC. ASCAP AND MY ONE OR SUBJECT OF THE NEXT TWO ISSUES ON THE AGENDA.

OKAY LET US MOVE ON NOW TO THE SECOND AGENDA ITEM IS AN OVERVIEW OF THE CALIFORNIA. THE PROGRAM DIRECTOR ARE YOU READY TO BEGIN. ABSOLUTELY. THIRD TWENTY TWENTY ONE STATE BUDGET DIRECTED ONE BILLION IN FEDERAL AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN AT FUNDING FOR THE NEWLY CREATED CALIFORNIA RESEARCH PAYMENT PROGRAM TO REDUCE PASSED BILL BILL BILL BALANCES INCURRED BY ENERGY UTILITY CUSTOMERS DURING THE KATKO THAT NINETEEN PANDEMIC. RESIDENTIAL COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS IN THE UTILITY BILLS THAT WERE SIXTY DAYS OR MORE PAST DUE FOR ENERGY USE DURING THE PANDEMIC RELIEF BILL PERIOD BETWEEN MARCH FOURTH TWENTY TWENTY. THREE JUNE FIFTEENTH TWENTY TWENTY ONE ARE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE A CAP BENEFIT. THE NEW CAP GOVERNMENT CODE SECTION NINE HUNDRED NINETY THREE POINT FIVE MILLION AND FIGHT IN FUNDING WAS TO BE EXPENDED BY PRIORITY GROUP. AND THEREFORE PRAY RECORDS. FIRST OUR ACTIVE RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMERS AT RISK OF DISCONNECTION SECOND ALL ACTIVE RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMERS WITH PAST DUE BALANCES. THIRD ALL INACTIVE RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMERS WITH PAST DUE BALANCES ENFORCED. ALL COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS WITH PAST DUE BALANCES. C. AS HE WAS REQUIRED TO DISTRIBUTE ALL CAP FUNDING TO ENERGY UTILITIES BY JANUARY THIRTY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TWO. ONE TIME SURVEY RESULTS FROM SEPTEMBER TWENTY TWENTY ONE ESTIMATED TOTAL TOTAL STATE WHITE ENERGY UTILITY REAR JUST TO BE NEAR NEARLY TWO BILLION DOLLARS. IN THE ONE BILLION CAP FUNDING WILL ADDRESS ROUGHLY HALF OF ALL STATEWIDE ENERGY A RELIGIOUS ACCRUED DURING THE PANDEMIC. BILL RELIEF PERIOD. TO GAIN A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE CURRENT STATUS OF PAST YOU BOUNCES AFTER ALL CAP BENEFITS ARE APPLIED TO CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS. GST WILL BE SERVING ALL UTILITIES ARE RECEIVING CAPITAL CATION. THIS SURVEY WILL CAPTURE REAR JUST FROM NOT ONLY THE PANDEMIC BILL RELIEF PERIOD. OF MARCH TWENTIETH TO JUNE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUT ALSO INCLUDES THE PERIOD BEFORE MARCH TWENTY TWENTY. AND THE PERIOD FOLLOWING JUNE TWENTY TWENTY ONE. ZERO DE AND- COMPLETING THIS REAR SIR. IN THE SPRING. WITHIN SIX MONTHS OF RECEIVING A CAPITAL OCCASION AND ENERGY UTILITIES REQUIRED TO REPORT ON CAP OUTCOMES FOLLOWING THE DELIVERY BENEFITS THESE OUTCOMES INCLUDE AMONG OTHER DATA POINTS. THEY DON'T TOTAL FUNDS DISTRIBUTED NUMBER OF CUSTOMER SERVICE AN AVERAGE BENEFIT AND SEE IF YOU MUST POST A STAT ON ITS PUBLIC WEBSITE WITHIN SIXTY DAYS OF RECEIPT AFTER ALL ENERGY UTILITIES SUBMIT THE REPORTS TO THE DEPARTMENT. FOR THE PUBLIC WE'VE HAD ANOTHER LITTLE FREEZE. EXPERIMENTATION I WOULD LIKE TO START BY STATING HOW PROUD I AM OF OUR SMALL DEPARTMENTS ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY ADMINISTERED THE ONE BILLION DOLLAR CAP PROGRAM UNDER SUCH A COMPRESSED TIME FOR IT CST HIT THE GROUND RUNNING IN JULY AND USE IT EXISTING STAFF RESOURCES TO SUCCESSFULLY DISTRIBUTE FUNDING THAT WILL SUPPORT OVER ONE POINT FIVE MILLION CALIFORNIA ENERGY CUSTOMERS TO PAY DOWN THEIR UTILITY DEBT. WHILE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF CAP STREAM CSP'S CAPACITY IT WAS THROUGH THE DEDICATIONOF THE DEPARTMENT STAFF. CLOSE COORDINATION WITH ENERGY UTILITIES AND OUR MEMBER ASSOCIATIONS AS WELL AS THE CAB AS WELL AS TO SEE IF YOU SEE. I CAN FOR THE PUBLIC OR HAVING SOME IN AND OUT. DIRECTLY BACK IN A SECOND. CURRENTLY REESTABLISHING CONNECTIONS. GOING TO TAKE A BRIEF RECESS WE TRY TO REESTABLISH OUR CONNECTION. IF YOU CAN HEAR ME. TO GO BACK TO MISTER SCRIBNER AND YOU WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT THE SIXTY DAYS THE UTILITIES HAD THÀNH TO NOTIFY. OKAY. LET'S SEE SO THAT THE SUBCOMMITTEE ALSO DEPARTMENTS RESPOND TO DO TO ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS ON CAP. THE FIRST WHICH REQUESTED SHE IS DUE TO PROVIDE A BRIEF UPDATE ON THE ROLLOUT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF CAP AND HIGHLIGHT THE SIGNIFICANT SUCCESSES OR CHALLENGES OF APARTMENTS FASTER IMPLEMENTATION. I'D LIKE TO START BY STATING HOW PROUD I AM OF OUR SMALL DEPARTMENTS ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY ADMINISTER THE ONE BILLION DOLLAR CAP PROGRAM UNDER SUCH A COMPRESSED TIME FRAME. CST HIT THE GROUND RUNNING IN JULY AND YOU. TO PAY DOWN THEIR UTILITY THAT. WELL THE IMPLEMENTATION OF CAP STRANGE YES THESE CAPACITY IT WAS THROUGH THE DEDICATION OF THE DEPARTMENT STAFF CLOSE COORDINATION WITH ENERGY UTILITIES AND THEIR MEMBER ASSOCIATIONS AS WELL TO SEE IF YOU SEE THIS IS THE SUCCESSFULLY DISTRIBUTED ALL CALIFORNIA TO ENERGY UTILITIES BY THE JANUARY THIRTY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TWO DEADLINE. FURTHERMORE SINCE SHE IS THE APPROVED CAP APPLICATIONS ON A FLOW BASIS. QUALIFIED CUSTOMERS HAVE BEEN RECEIVING CAPITAL CREDITS SINCE DECEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. CAPITA FUTURE BE APPLIED TO CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS ARE ONLY BASIS BANERJEE CHILES INSISTED EXPECTS ALL GOT FUNDS WILL BE CREDITED TO QUALIFIED ACCOUNTS NO LATER THAN EARLY APRIL OF THIS YEAR. THE MOST NOTABLE CHALLENGES YOU FACED WITH CAPITAL LIMITATION WAS NAVIGATING THE COMPLEXITIES OF SHARED UTILITY BILLING SYSTEMS. AND ENSURING ALL ELIGIBLE UTILITIES RECEIVE THEIR SHARE OF CAP FUNDS IN ACCORDANCE WITH PROGRAM RULES. JUST USE ABLE TO NAVIGATE THOSE ISSUES ALONG WITH CHALLENGES THAT INEVITABLY ARISE WITH IMPLEMENTING A PROGRAM OF THIS SCALE BY COORDINATING CLOSELY WITH THE UTILITIES IN THEIR MEMBER ASSOCIATIONS TO QUICKLY AND COLLABORATIVELY ADDRESS ISSUES AS THEY AROSE. ENSURE THE CAPTAIN OF HIS RICH CUSTOMERS AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. THE SECOND QUESTION A SUBCOMMITTEE YES YES YOU DO DRESS WAS WHETHER DEPARTMENT COORDINATED PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION WITH OTHER SOURCES OF ENERGY UTILITY RESEARCH ASSISTANTS AND IF SO. DESCRIBE THE DETAILS OF THIS COORDINATION. THE START IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE STATE'S EFFORTS TO ADDRESS CALIFORNIA'S ENERGY GETTING KERR DURING THE KEPT THE CODE NINETEEN PANDEMIC PREDATE THE CAP PROGRAM WILL CONTINUE AFTER THIS FUNDING IS DISBURSED. SEE IF YOU SEE AN ENERGY UTILITIES AND TAKEN A NUMBER OF STEPS TO OFFER ASSISTANCE TO CUSTOMERS ECONOMICALLY IMPACTED BY THE PANDEMIC. IT WOULD STRUGGLE WITH UTILITY PAYMENTS AS A RESULT. THIS INCLUDES DISCONTENT DISCONNECT MORE TORRANCE PAYMENT PLANS TO RAISE CUSTOMER DEBTS. AND DISCOUNT PROGRAMS TO LOWER ONGOING ENERGY CALLS. DURING CAPS IMPLEMENTATION CSTS CLEVER COLLABORATED CLOSELY WITH THE CQC ENERGY UTILITIES COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATORS AND STATE ASSOCIATIONS SUCH AS THE CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL UTILITIES ASSOCIATION. AS WELL AS PREVIOUSLY THIS CORONATION WAS CRITICAL TO THE SUCCESSFUL AND TIMELY ROLL OUT OF CAPITALIST UTILITIES A QUALIFIED CUSTOMERS OFFERED UNDER CAP. THIS IS PROVIDED ENERGY UTILITIES AND CUSTOMERS WITH INFORMATION ABOUT OTHER SOURCES OF ASSISTANCE FOR CUSTOMERS STRUGGLING TO PAY THEIR UTILITY BILLS INCLUDING CSP'S LOW INCOME HOME ENERGY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. AS WELL AS CALIFORNIANS CODE NINETEEN BRETT RELIEF PROGRAM WHICH PROVIDES FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FOR RENT AND UTILITIES TO INCOME ELIGIBLE CALIFORNIA RENTERS AND LANDLORDS. HAVE BEEN IMPACTED BY THE COVER NINETEEN PENDENNIS. CSP'S LIE HE PROGRAM IS ALSO PRIORITIZING TWO HUNDRED THREE MILLION DOLLARS IN SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING FROM THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN ACT. TOWARDS FINANCIAL SYSTEMS TO REDUCE ENERGY BILL REAR JUST FOR LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. AS A SUBCOMMITTEE OF ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS ON THE CAP PROGRAM AT THIS TIME. WELL FIRST I'D I'D LOOK AT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. I YES IS JULIA BAKER WE HAVE NO CONCERNS WITH THIS SUMMARY OF THE CAP PROGRAM THANK YOU WE'RE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU VERY MUCH L. A. L. THANK YOU ANGELES SHORT WITH THE L. A. O. WE WANTED TO NOTE THAT THE ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN FUNDING PROVIDED FOR CAP- MARCH QUITE A SIGNIFICANT AUGMENTATION TO THE DEPARTMENT'S BUDGET. AND THE DEPARTMENT HAS MANAGED TO CONDUCT A STATEWIDE ENERGY UTILITY A RESEARCH SURVEY FIELD APPLICATIONS AND ALLOCATE FUNDS ALL IN A TIMELY MANNER- WE WANTED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THESE EFFORTS AND ALSO KNOWLEDGE THAT THE DOCUMENTS AND INFORMATION CST HAS ENSURING ON THEIR WEBSITE. AB HELPED FACILITATE TRANSPARENCY AND OVERSIGHT OF THE PROGRAM- WE'RE CONTINUING TO MONITOR THE PROGRESS OF CAP. PARTICULARLY AS THE PROGRAM NOW ENTERS INTO THE RECORDING PHASE AND WILL BE SHORTER REYES ANY FUTURE ISSUES FOR LEGISLATIVE. THANK YOU MAKE SURE YOU FOR YOU WE FROZE FOR A MINUTE BUT I THINK WE GOT WE GOT ALL OF IT. AND DIRECTOR SCRIBNER'S NOT OFTEN YOU GET A SHOUT OUT FROM THE L. A- SO CONGRATULATIONS ON THAT- I JUST HAD A FEW QUESTIONS. JUST KIND OF FOR THE PUBLIC TO SO THE PAYMENTS GO TO THE UTILITIES CORRECT IT'LL GO DIRECTLY TO THE CONSUMER. BUT THERE WILL BE CREATED ON TO A CONSUMER BUILT ON TO THE CONSUMERS BILLS SO THE PAYMENT DID GO FROM THE DEPARTMENT DIRECTLY TO THE UTILITY. AND THEN THERE WILL BE A CREDIT OUGHT THAT WILL SHOW UP ON. EACH ELIGIBLE A CUSTOMER'S BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THEN MY SECOND QUESTION AROUND THAT IS. WE SAID WE ARE PAYING IT DOWN SO WE ARE WE ARE WE JUST. ARE WE SPREADING IT OUT AND PAYING PEOPLE'S. HOW MUCH THEY OWE DOWN ARE WE PAYING IT OFF. FOR EVERY INDIVIDUAL- OF A FAMILY AND THEN GOING TO THE NEXT. THE NEXT PERSON. IT WILL- IT DEPENDS BY UTILITY- THE ALLOCATION- IN IN SOME INSTANCES WOULD REPRESENT A PERCENTAGE OF IT THE TOTAL OWED BY A PARTICULAR CUSTOMER IT JUST DEPENDS ON HOW LARGE THE AVERAGE BALANCES. AND IN OTHER INSTANCES IT WOULD BE ABLE TO- HAVE PAID OFF ONE PARTICULAR. PRAYER GROUPS- AMOUNT OWED. AND THEN PUSH DOWN FURTHER. WHAT WE CALL THE WATERFALL THROUGH THE FOR PRIORITY GROUPS. AND PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO THOSE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF CUSTOMERS AS IT WENT THROUGH. BUT AGAIN I DID GO TO- PRIMARILY TO HOW MUCH WAS OWED BY EACH PRIORITY GROUP- AND BY UTILITY. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH DIRECTOR. AT THIRTY PAN QUESTIONS. Q. AND THE END OF I MISSED THIS BUT YOU YOU MENTIONED SO WE HAVE THE FOR PRIORITY GROUPS- AND YOU MENTIONED THAT ROUGHLY ESTIMATED TWO BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF REAR SO- SO HOW FAR. DOWN THESE PRIORITY GROUPS ARE WE GOING TO YET- SO. IT SO WHEN YOU'RE DISTURBING THE MONEY TO THE UTILITIES. IS A ARE YOU GETTING EVERYTHING I MEAN CUTTING INFORMATION FROM THEM. IS IT THAT YOU'RE EXAMPLE EVERYONE OF COURSE YOU KNOW HOPEFULLY THERE'S ENOUGH MONEY COVERED ONE IN THE FIRST PRIORITY GROUPS AND THEN WERE MIDWAY THROUGH THE SECOND OR THIRD SO HOW HOW HOW EXACTLY DOES THAT DOES THAT WORK IN TERMS OF. GOING THROUGH PRIORITY GROUPS IS THAT. IT'S NOT LIKE DO YOU ALLOCATE AMOUNT TO EACH UTILITY AND THEN THEY SEE HOW FAR THEY CAN GO DOWN. OR YOU SERVE SAYING OKAY WE'RE PULLING ALL THIS DATA TOGETHER AND THEN WERE. THEN EVERYONE IS THE FIRST PARTY GROUP NO MATTER WHAT UTILITY AND THEN WE GO TO THE SECOND GROUP AT CETERA SO HOW'S THAT WORK. YEAH YOU DID GREAT QUESTION AND IT IS A LITTLE BIT OF A COULD A COMPLEX- KIND OF MATH PROBLEM AT. THAT IT DID THE BASE IS ALWAYS COMES FROM THE ARREARS THAT'S REPORTED BY A PARTICULAR UTILITY. AND OBVIOUSLY WE DID THE INTENT WAS ALWAYS TO ADDRESS- 1100% A BILL RICH FROM PRAIRIE GROUP ONE AND ANYTHING THAT REMAINED WHAT WE CALL WAS WATERFALL DOWN TO EACH PRIORITY GROUP. AS THEY COULD BE PAID OFF IN FULL. SO THAT THERE WAS ALWAYS- THE FIRST BY THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF PRAYER YOU PAID FOR- WITH THESE DOLLARS. NOW THE COMPLEXITY COMES FROM THE FACT THAT DIFFERENT UTILITIES WOULD HAVE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF A REAR AGES AND A DIFFERENT ALLOCATION. WHICH THEIR ALLOCATION IS BASED ON A POLL PERCENT. OF THE- REARRANGE. A STATEWIDE. SO SOME UTILITIES AGAIN LIKE I HAD STATED WOULD BE ABLE TO PAY OFF MOVING A PRAYER GROUP DETENTION MOVE INTO THREE AND FOUR. THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES AS AN EXAMPLE. I DID NOT REPORT ANY PRAYER GROUP ONE UTILITIES BECAUSE AS I MENTIONED EARLIER BECAUSE OF THE MORE MORATORIUMS THE DISTRICT YOU SEE. NO RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMER WAS FACING IMMINENT JUST CONNECTION AT THE TIME THAT SURVEY WAS IMPLEMENTED AND THAT APPLICATION. ALL FUNDS THEN FOR THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES WOULD GO DIRECTLY TO PRIMARY GROUP TO CUSTOMERS. BUT THE L. U. ARREARS DATA WAS SO HIGH. IT WAS ONLY ABLE TO ADDRESS A PERCENTAGE OF EACH CUSTOMER'S BILL AND EACH CUSTOMER WOULD RECEIVE THE EXACT SAME AMOUNT WHICH WOULD MEAN. IF THE ALLOCATION. TO FOR EXAMPLE P. GINNY WOULD ONLY HIT. JUST LIKE THAT. BRAD I AND THAT AGAIN THAT BENEFIT VARIES BY UTILITY AND BY ALLOCATION ACROSS THE BOARD ALL OF THAT INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE ON THE CSU WEBSITE WE DO HAVE- A OF KIND OF A SCORECARD- THAT EVERYONE COULD LOOK AT AND SEE NOT ONLY WITH THE ARREARS WAS THE ALLOCATION AND THEN THE PERCENTAGE PAID TO EACH OF THE FOUR PRIMARY GROUPS OKAY SO THAT'S ALL AVAILABLE ON YOUR WEBSITE. YES IT IS PER UTILITY OKAY YES IT IS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. LET'S MOVE ON THEN TO ISSUE NUMBER THREE AND I WOULD JUST SAY. FOR A DAILYO AND THEN- DEPARTMENT FINANCE I'M GONNA CALL ON YOU EVERY TIME JUST BECAUSE- WE'RE HAVING A LITTLE TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES AND I DON'T HAVE IT UP ON MY SCREEN SO I CANNOT SEE. YOUR RAISE HAND ON MY ON MY- LAPTOP SO MANY COLONY EVERY TIME YOU DON'T HAVE TO JUST TELL ME NOTHING IF YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING OKAY. ISSUE NUMBER THREE DIRECTOR. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THIS IS ALSO IMPLEMENTING THE NEW FEDERAL LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLD WATER ASSISTANCE PROGRAM OR MY WALK. UNDERLIE WHAT CALIFORNIA WAS ALLOCATED ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME FUNDING TO PROVIDE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. TO LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS FOR THE RESIDENTIAL WATER UTILITY COSTS- FEDERAL GUIDANCE I WALKED AS MODELED ON EXISTING LOW INCOME HOME ENERGY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM PROCESS. THESE PROCEDURES AND POLICIES. CONSISTENT WITH THE GOVERNMENT FELT THE PROGRAM WILL FOCUS ON ADDRESSING WATER AND WASTEWATER RELIGIOUS FOR LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. THE SUBCOMMITTEE ASKED THE DEPARTMENT JUST TO RESPOND TO ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS ON MY WALL THE FIRST OF WHICH REQUESTED CST TO PROVIDE AN UPDATE ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF LAW I WANT. TO HIGHLIGHT ANY SIGNIFICANT SUCCESSES OR CHALLENGES THE DEPARTMENT SPACE DURING PROGRAM ROLL OUT. IN AUGUST TWENTY TWENTY ONE CEST FINALIZED THE LIE WACHTER HALF STATE PLAN AFTER STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS AND THE DRAFT STATE PLANS RELEASED FOR PUBLIC COMMENT. WE RECEIVED FINAL STATE PLAN APPROVAL FROM FEDERAL OFFICIALS IN NOVEMBER. CST CONTINUES TO RECEIVE ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE FROM THE US DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES I FEDERAL EXPECTATIONS FOR PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION. CST IS ALSO BEEN. MY WALK. IN COSTS WITH AGENCIES THAT WILL PROVIDE OUTRAGE INTAKE AN ELIGIBILITY SERVICES AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. DEPARTMENT PLANS ON RELEASING THOSE PROGRAM GUIDELINES FOR FINAL PUBLIC COMMENT LATER ON THIS WEEK. THROUGHOUT THE DEVELOPMENT OF WHY WHAT CST IS BEEN IN REGULAR CONSULTATION WITH THE CPUC AND THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD AS THE BOARD IMPLEMENTS ITS ONE BILLION DOLLAR WATER AND WASTEWATER RESEARCH PROGRAM. THE STATE WATER BOARD IS REPORTED THAT THROUGH THEIR WATER RESEARCH PROGRAM PAYMENTS TOTALING APPROXIMATELY THREE HUNDRED ONE MILLION DOLLARS FOR ISSUE TO PARTICIPATING TOO MANY WATER SYSTEMS. TO ADDRESS 1100% OF QUALIFY DRINKING WATER DEBT. WASTE REARS DATA HAS NOT BEEN SURVEYED THE STATE WATER BOARD. FIFTEEN TO TWENTY TWENTY ONE PANDEMIC RELIEF BILL PERIOD. WELL I WANT TO PLAY A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN CLOSING THIS GAP BY OFFERING FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS CONTINUING TO EXPERIENCE DIFFICULTY MAKING PAYMENTS FOR WATER AND WASTEWATER SERVICES. I WANT SERVICE DELIVERY SCHEDULED TO COMMENCE IN MAY. SINCE CSP AND ITS SERVICE PROVIDERS HAVE NOT ADMINISTERED WATER BENEFITS IN THE PAST THE DEPARTMENT IS INVESTING SIGNIFICANT UP FRONT TIME AND RESOURCES TO DEVELOP Y. WHAT GUIDELINES ENGAGE WITH WATER PROVIDERS IN ORDER TO ENSURE EFFECTIVE PROGRAM ADMINISTRATION AND SERVICE DELIVERY FOR CUSTOMERS ACROSS THE STATE AT PROGRAM LAUNCH. CST CONTINUES TO RECEIVE UPDATED GUIDANCE FROM FEDERAL OFFICIALS ON EXPECTATIONS FOR PROGRAM ADMINISTRATION. AND THAT FACTORED ND THE REALITY THAT WE ARE DEPENDENT ON WATER UTILITIES OPTING IN TO PARTICIPATE THE PROGRAM THROUGH DIRECT PAY AGREEMENTS. DOES CREATE SOME UNKNOWNS THAT ARE OUTSIDE THE DEPARTMENT'S CONTROL. WITH THAT BEING SAID WE ARE CONFIDENT THAT WE'RE LAYING THE GROUNDWORK FOR SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM LAUNCH. EIGHT COMING IN MAY. THE SECOND QUESTION THE SEVERITY THE SUB COMMITTEE WISHED CST DO ADDRESSED WITH WINDOWS THE PART EXPECT TO RELEASE PROGRAM GUIDELINES FOR THE FOUR LINE WHAT. AS STATED PREVIOUSLY CST WILL BE RELEASING FINAL FINAL WHY WHAT PROGRAM GUIDELINES FOR PUBLIC COMMENT THIS WEEK. IN THE DEPARTMENT WILL ALSO BE HOLDING PUBLIC MEETINGS ARE A PUBLIC MEETING TO REVIEW THE GUIDELINES FOLLOWING PROGRAM GUIDELINES RELEASE. ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE OR COMMENTS FROM FINANCE RALLY- AT THIS TIME ONLINE WHAT. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. NO COMMENTS OR CONCERNS AT THIS TIME THANK YOU. ELIA. YES ANGELES SHORT WITH YELLOW AS NOTED IN YOUR AGENDA OF THE FUNDING FOR A LIE WHAT IS A RELATIVELY SMALL. THE STATE WATER BOARD OF FOR US SIMILAR PURPOSE OF ADDRESSING WATER AND WASTEWATER RIDGES THEREFORE WE VIEW COLLABORATION BETWEEN THE TWO ADMINISTERING ENTITIES AS AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF EFFECTIVELY IMPLEMENTING THE TWO PROGRAMS- YOU JUST HEARD DIRECTOR SCRIBNER SPEAK A BIT TO THIS COLLABORATION SO WE HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENTS AT THIS TIME- BUT WILL BE CONTINUING TO MONITOR IMPLEMENTATION PROGRESS OF THE PROGRAM AND WILL CERTAINLY RAISE ANY FUTURE ISSUES FOR LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION THANK YOU VERY MUCH. DR GRANT. THANKS THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THAT PRESENTATION NOTING THAT THEIR APPROXIMATELY THREE THOUSAND WATER AND WASEWATER SYSTEMS I DON'T KNOW IF EACH ONE OF THEM HAVE A SEPARATE YOU KNOW. BILLING AND IT'S CETERA- I GUESS IN THE TERMS OF. IT'S A TRIED TO BUY YOU TALKED ABOUT SOME OF THE CHALLENGES IN TERMS OF THE ROLL OUT OF YOU. SO HOW. DO YOU HAVE SUFFICIENT DATA TO BE ABLE TO BE SURE WE'RE TARGETING THE FUNDS SOME OF WHICH ARE YOU KNOW SAID THAT. IT'S ON SMALLER SCALE TWO HUNDRED SIXTEEN MILLION. I MEAN IT'S A LOT OF MONEY BUT STILL IT'S A MUCH SMALLER SCALE IN TERMS BEACH OVER TARGETING THE RIGHT HOUSEHOLDS WITH THIS I MEAN GIVEN THE FACTORS UNLIKE UTILITIES WHICH WE JUST TALKED ABOUT. YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT MORE WATER SYSTEMS. SO IN TERMS OF- BEING ABLE TO PRIORITIZE THAT WHILE NOT DRIVING UP THE OVERHEAD- I'M ON THIS PARTICULAR PROGRAM. YES THEY THE PROGRAM IS SINCE IT'S MODELED AFTER SHE IS THESE LIE HE PROGRAM IT IS ADMINISTERED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WHICH MEANS IT IS A ONE CUSTOMER ONE APPLICATION APPROACH. AND SO ELIGIBLE CUSTOMERS WILL BE COMING INTO THEIR LOCAL SERVICE PROVIDERS. AND SUBMITTING BILLS- SEEKING THESE- THESE FUNDS SO- THE DEPARTMENT IS WORKING WITH A THIRD PARTY IMPLEMENTOR. WHO WILL BE HANDLING THE DIRECT PAY AGREEMENTS. ARE BETWEEN THE FUNDING SOURCE THE DEPARTMENT AND THE WATER AND WASTEWATER UTILITY. AS LAW DOES NOT PERMIT THE DEPARTMENT TO ISSUE ANY BENEFITS DIRECTLY TO CUSTOMERS IT MUST GO TO THE UTILITY ITSELF. BUT CENTER HANDED THE APPLICATION PROCESS WILL BE TARGETED SPECIFICALLY TO LOW INCOME CUSTOMERS WITHIN THE AREAS THAT ARE AGENCIES COVER STATEWIDE. OKAY AND- YOUR ALLOCATION TO THE DIFFERENT AGENCIES IS THAT BASED ON. THE ESTIMATED PERCENTAGE OF LOW INCOME CUSTOMERS ARE. AS SONYA YET I'M JUST I'VE GOT THE ACCOUNTABILITY PART AT THE BACK AND SO. I MEAN I KNOW YOU TO USE YOUR BEST EFFORTS TO GET THE MONEY TO THE RIGHT PEOPLE. AND THEN ARE WE GONNA HAVE THE KIND OF INFORMATION GOING BACK SAYING WELL THIS IS WHO THE MONEY ACTUALLY ENDED UP GOING TO AND- THE AND SO FORTH OF WE CAN AVAIL FOR IMPROVEMENT. THE DISTRIBUTION OF FUNDS TO THE LOCAL AGENCIES IS GOING TO BE BASED ON A SIMILAR OF MULTI FACTOR OF FORMULA THAT WE USE FOR OUR LIGHT HEAT FUNDS AND SO THAT THE DISTRIBUTION OF FUNDS WHAT WILL BE BASED. A LOT ON IT TO THOSE THAT POINTS A NUMBER OF LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS THE AREA AS WELL AS- THE DOLLARS NEEDED BY THE AGENCIES SO IT IS A AGAIN IT A LITTLE BIT OF A MATH ISSUE BUT THE IN AND SINCE WE DON'T HAVE THAT SURVEY DATA WERE THAT. THAT THE OVERALL CONNECTION WITH THE WATER UTILITIES- WE WILL BE GETTING REPORTING BACK FROM OUR AGENCIES ON THE LOW INCOME CUSTOMERS THAT HAVE BEEN SERVED UNTIL I WALK PROGRAM. I GUESS ONE OTHER QUESTION IS THAT IT IS THAT YOU KNOW WHAT THREE THOUSAND DIFFERENT THAT'S A SITE THAT THE WATER AGENCIES COME IN ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT SIZES I KNOW JUST FOR MY OWN DISTRICT UNITY OF LARGE ONES SAY OF SMALLER ONES. AND TO BE FRANK WE'VE DEALT WITH THIS BEFORE- WATER ISSUES YOU KNOW SOME OF THEM ARE MUCH MORE CAPABLE ADMINISTRATIVELY THAN OTHERS OTHERS HAVE RUN INTO SOME CHALLENGES IN TERMS OF THEIR ABILITY TO. BUY THEIR SUPPLY WATER ARE YOU KNOW IN MINISTER THINGS SO IS THAT IS THAT PROVING TO BE A CHALLENGE BECAUSE I OFTENTIMES ACTUALLY SOME OF THE SMALLER ONES. WHICH MAY HAVE LESS CAPACITY- FOR UNDERSTANDING WHAT'S IN JAIL FOR MANAGING THEIR WATER SYSTEMS. ALSO TEND THIS ALSO SERVES THE LOWEST INCOME. NEIGHBORHOODS SO I JUST WONDER AS FAR AS YOUR- EXPERIENCE OUR MEDIA INTERMEDIARY THAT AGENTS DON'T PERSON CONTRACTING WITH- HOW. HOW YOU'RE DEALING WITH THAT PARTICULAR ISSUE- IT'S- YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE GIVING MONEY DIRECTLY TO THE AGENCIES- NOW SOME AGENCIES A SAID HOUSE LESS CAPACITY FOR HANDLING. THINGS THAN OTHERS. YEAH THIS THE FUNDS ARE GOING TO BE- IDENTIFIED BY AGENCY BUT YET THEY WILL BE PAID DIRECTLY TO THE WATER UTILITIES THROUGH OUR OUR THIRD PARTY IMPLEMENTOR AND IT IS A CHALLENGE THAT WE ARE ADDRESSING BECAUSE WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO ESTABLISH DIRECT PAY AGREEMENTS. WITH THREE THOUSAND WATER. UTILITIES BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT THE OUR THIRD PARTY IMPLEMENTOR HAS EXPERIENCE DOING- THEY WE FEEL VERY CONFIDENT THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET THIS PROGRAM UP AND RUNNING AND START. THIS PROCESS FROM DAY ONE- BUT AGAIN IT IS TO YOUR POINT CENTER AND IT IS UP TO YOU THOSE PARTICULAR- WATER UTILITIES TO BEND YOU DON'T PARTICIPATE WITH BUT THE DEPARTMENT AND OUR THIRD PARTY IMPLEMENTOR- TO ESTABLISH THAT AGREEMENT SO THAT FUNDS CAN FLOW ONCE APPLICATIONS ARE BEING RECEIVED BY OUR AGENCIES FOR THEIR PARTICULAR CUSTOMERS OKAY. WELL I APPRECIATE THE EFFORT I KNOW THERE'S A LOT CHALLENGES I THINK THE IMPORTANT THING IS FIRST AND ON THE BACK AND THAT'S WAS ASKING OF THE BACK AND EVALUATION SO THAT WE SEE GAPS- YOU KNOW THERE'S CERTAIN WATER AGENCIES FOR HOOVER SAID SUMMARIES ARE NOT EITHER DON'T PARTICIPATE ARE NOT PARTICIPATING IN A WAY. YET THEY HAD THEIR SERVING COMMUNITIES THERE- PARTICULARLY DISADVANTAGED- WE WILL FIGURE OUT THEN WHAT OTHER APPROACHES WE MIGHT TAKE TO BE SURE THAT THOSE CUSTOMERS ARE HEALTH SO AGAIN I KNOW IT'S A YOU'RE YOU'RE TRYING TO STAND A PROGRAM VERY QUICKLY. AND WITH A SOMEWHAT COMPLEX WATER SYSTEM THE L. DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM- IN TERMS OF NOT JUST ORGANIZATIONALLY NOT JUST MECHANICALLY- SO BUT OF THE VERY INTERESTED IN SEEING WHAT THE ANYTHING THE VALUATION RESULT AT THE BACK AND ESPECIALLY. WE FEEL THAT MORE FUNDS MIGHT MIGHT MAKE AVAILABLE FOR THIS WILL BE SURE TO USE DEFECTIVE WE KNOW WE'RE LEARNING. LESSONS FROM FROM THIS EXPERIENCE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO PAN AM ANA THAT. GOOD BOTH ON ON THE WATER AS WELL AS ON UTILITIES. FORGIVE ME FOR NOT KNOWING ALL THE BUCKETS BY HEART BUT DO WE TAKE INTO ACCOUNT. PLACES LIKE I REPRESENT UP AND DOWN IN THE VALLEY WHERE WE HAVE. JUST INCREDIBLY HIGH- LACK OF WATER AND VERY HIGH HEATS WHERE PEOPLE. HAVE NO OTHER CHOICE BUT TO ROUTE RUNNER UTILITIES ALMOST AROUND THE CLOCK. WHAT WENT ON WHEN OFTENTIMES YOU KNOW THEY THEY HAVE THE LEAST ENERGY EFFICIENT ONES. IS THE IS OUR REGION TAKE INTO ACCOUNT AS WELL OR JUST LEVELS OF POVERTY. BOTH OF THESE PROGRAMS. WELL FOR THE FOR CAP- THE IT WAS JUST BASICALLY THAT THE TOTAL REAR RIDGE BY UTILITIES SO KNOW THAT THOSE ISSUES WERE TAKEN- CAL BUT I THINK THAT THEY WOULD JUST NATURALLY BE PART OF THE MATH THAT WOULD COME INTO IT THE HIGHER ARREARS DOLLARS WOULD BE REPRESENTATIVE FROM THOSE THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE USING- THEIR UTILITIES MORE- IN HIGH HEAT- SCENARIOS. AS FAR AS LIKE WHAT THE FACTORS IN DETERMINING THE NUMBERS GOING TO THE AGENCIES WILLINCLUDE THE INCOME POPULATION AND THEN THE WATER COST SO- THOSE INS DOES AREAS THAT MAY HAVE HIGHER INSTANCES OF- THE COST JUST TO GET WATER MAIN NECESSARILY- RECEIVED A- A LARGER ALLOCATION AND AT THE ABILITY TO HAVE A POTENTIALLY MORE CUSTOMERS- AFFECTED IN AND IMPACTED. BY THE LAYOFFS OF FUNDING. OKAY I THINK YOU HAVE TO GET SOME OF BERMAN A LOOK INTO MORE IN THE FUTURE LIKE THIS. REGIONAL ISSUES WITH ALL THIS MONEY WE'RE HAVING FOR UTILITIES- THEM OKAY LET'S MOVE ON. THE DEPARTMENT OF. CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES. WE'RE GOING TO HEAR THEM FROM DIRECTOR DAVID KILGOUR. AND WE THANK YOU DIRECTOR SCRIBNER FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. AFTERNOON SENATORS OF YOUR SECOND DAVID US ABOUT THIS. AFTERNOON THAT THEY. YES SAID DID YOUR DAD DIRECTOR FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORT SERVICES I'M HAPPY TO BE HERE IN FRONT OF YOU SHARING THREE MAJOR INITIATIVES THAT WE HAVE IN THIS YEAR'S PROPOSALS FOR THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. AND THE FIRST I WOULD LIKE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT IS THE FULL PASS THROUGH AND CURRENCY FOR ON FORMER CHILD SUPPORT CASES THIS IS A CONTINUATION OF SEVERAL YEARS OF EFFORTS ON THE DEPARTMENT'S BEHALF GM. IMPLEMENT WHAT WE CAN IN IN THE FIGHT AGAINST POVERTY PREVENTION HERE IN CALIFORNIA THE FIRST OF THOSE CHANGES WAS ARE CHANGED TO THE DEFICIT D. R. A. DEFICIT DEFICIT REDUCTION ACT AND DISTRIBUTION MODEL FOR CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES WHICH INCLUDES ALL PAYMENTS FROM ALL SOURCES. GOING TO PAY OFF FAMILIES FIRST BEFORE GOVERNMENT THE SECOND THOSE CHANGES STARTED IN NEGOTIATIONS IN NINETEEN TWENTY WITH THE MINISTRATION THE LEGISLATIVE OFFICE ABOUT CURRENT SUPPORT PASTOR AND HOW MUCH WE PASSED THROUGH ON ON THOSE OF MONEY IN THE CAMANCHE NEGOTIATION THERE WAS TO GO TO THE FEDERAL MAXIMUM AND I'LL TALK ABOUT THAT A BIT MORE OF THE TERM ACTION IS ONE OR TWO HUNDRED. IN COLLABORATION WITH THE FARMERS SOCIAL SERVICES AND WITH CHILD SUPPORT AND WE WERE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT THE TECHNICAL CHANGES LAST YEAR TO FULLY IMPLEMENT THAT EFFECTIVE JANUARY FIRST OF THIS YEAR STOCKS INCREASED IN PAST DUE TO FAMILIES WENT FROM FIFTY DOLLARS TO ONE HUNDRED AND TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS. THIS THIRD PIECE HERE THAT YOU'RE SEEING FOR YOU TODAY IS A CONTINUATION OF THAT UTILIZING THE FEDERAL ALLOWABLE OPPORTUNITIES BEFORE US TO PASS TO TAKE TO EXERCISE THE OPTION TO PASS THROUGH ALL OF THE CLASSES THAT WE RECEIVED ON OUR FORMALLY ASSISTED FAMILIES THROUGH THE FAMILIES INSTEAD OF RETAINING THAT THE GOVERNMENT. AND THAT WOULD AMOUNTS TO IN IMPACTS THE STATE'S BUDGET OF ABOUT NINE THREE MILLION DOLLARS THIS YEAR BUT IT ALLOWS US TO DO STUPID ALMOST DOUBLE THAT FAMILIES CLOSING ON TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS ANNUALLY MOVING FORWARD AT FOR THEIR ASSISTANCE. THERE ARE ASERIES OF QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAD ON THIS PARTICULAR PIECE- WHAT IS ONE OCCURRENCE OF COURT- WHEN I PASSED THROUGH ALL OF. TRANSIT ON FOR FIRST THE SYSTEM FAMILY. NO THREE MAY REASON WHY THAT THAT'S BEEN CHALLENGING THE FIRST IS- WE HAD A MOVED WITH THE- FOR. TO GO TO ONE HUNDRED HUNDRED DOLLAR. AND THE START OF YEAR. AND JUST PIECE IS WE DO NOT HAVE THAT AUTHORITY TO GO ABOUT THAT SO IF WE WERE TO MAKE THE DECISION TO PASS THROUGH. AND THE ADDITIONAL HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR CURRENTLY ASSISTED FAMILIES WE WOULD HAVE TO MAKE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HOLES FOR THEIR 50% OF THE SHARES RECOLLECTION SO. THERE'S AN ADDED IMPACTS TO THE STATE'S BUDGET. AND TO MAKE THEIR OWN GOVERNMENT HOLE THERE IS A DISCUSSION FEDERAL LEVEL ABOUT WHETHER THAT'S GOING TO BE CHANGED ON THE ROAD BUT THEY'RE NOT QUITE THERE YET. AND THEN THE THIRD PIECE- ON THIS. CONCEPT ABOUT. MOVING TO CURRENT PASSED THROUGH ALL TRANSPORT REALLY HAS TO DO WITH OUR SYSTEMS ITSELF WE JUST IMPLEMENTED ONE AND TWO HUNDRED WE REALLY WANT TO SEE THE IMPACTS OF THAT AND THE FACT IT HAS ON THE FAMILY WE- TO GO ABOVE AND BEYOND THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO GO INTO FRTHER DISCUSSIONS ABOUT EXACTLY WHAT WE JUST REGARD WHEN IT COMES TO OTHER TYPES OF SERVICES ON THE PARCEL SERVICES SIGN. AND THEN JUST FRONT TECHNOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE WHICH PARCEL SERVICE IS GOING TO THEIR MAJOR OVERHAUL AND SYSTEMS WE DON'T FEEL WE WOULD BE ABLE TO GET TO THIS AND TELL TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE YEAR AT THE EARLIEST SO WE HAVE A LITTLE BIT TIME I THINK TO LOOK AT THE NUMBERS IN THE SASS WERE WRAPPED WITH THIS INCREASE FASTER THAN WE CAN MAKE SOME DISCUSSIONS ABOUT. FOR THE PAST DOING. CURRENT SUPPORT AS YOU MOVE DOWN THE ROAD. I WANTED TO. IT OVER TO NAY. SECULAR ABOUT THEM TO. BUDGET AND THE LOCAL TRANSPORT. AGENCIES. HI HI GOOD AFTERNOON- CENTERED EGGMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE- MUNNINGS MANSION- I WANTED TO GO OVER QUICKLY THE- COVERS BUDGET FOR DEPARTMENT TRANSPORT SERVICES ON THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET POSES ONE POINT ONE SIX BILLION DOLLARS THREE HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR NINE GENERAL FUND FOR THE DEPARTMENT JOHNSON SERVICES INCREASE OF SIXTY SIX NINE DOLLARS FROM THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO PROJECT ON ONE OF OUR MAJOR CHANGES IS FIFTY NINE MILLION DOLLARS OR TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND FOR LOCAL CHILD SUPPORT AGENCY ADMINISTRATION. THIS IS THE CONSTANT CONTINUATION OF A MOTOR YOUR WRAP UP TO PROVIDE SUFFICIENT INEQUITABLE FUNDING UNDER FUNDED ALL CSAS AND BRING THEM INTO PARITY WITH THE US YES THE FUNDING METHODOLOGY THAT WAS ADOPTED IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY- THE BY. ALSO INCLUDE THE TRUMP WHICH PASSED THROUGH WHICH DAVID DISCUSSED- EARLIER. AND TROUBLING WHICH FOR SOME FINAL WHICH CHRIS WILL TALK ABOUT LATER ON- AS FAR AS COLLECTIONS IS CONCERNED DEPARTMENT ESTIMATES TWO POINT FIVE BILLION IN TOTAL DISTRIBUTOR COLLECTIONS FOR FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. THIS IS A ECREASE OF ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS COMPARED TO THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BY JACK. THIS DECLINE IS- IS THE CONTINUING DOWNWARD TREND DUE TO BE COPING RELATED STIMULUS MEASURES ROLLING OFF. SUCH AS ENHANCED UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS AND DECLINING TAX ANCEPS WELL THE LABOR MARKET IS SLOWLY RECOVERING. AS THE AMBIENCE ASK FOR THE IMBALANCE BETWEEN THE DECLINES IN ASSISTANCE QUESTION VERSUS NOT ASSISTANCE QUESTIONS THIS IS ATTRIBUTED TO A NET ZERO SHIFT OF ASSISTANCE QUESTIONS TO NON ASSISTANCE QUESTIONS. DUE TO THE DEPARTMENTS FOR PASSED THE PROPOSAL WHICH REFLECTS THESE DOLLARS GOING FROM FOUND GOING. TO FAMILIES AND SET OF GOVERNMENT WORK- HAVE YOU TAKE ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE. SINCE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. I YES AND NO CONCERNS OR QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME MESOPOTAMIANS ANYTHING. LOL THIS IS JACKIE BRISTOW WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST OFFICE- WE'RE STILL WORKING ON FINALIZING OUR ANALYSIS OF THE CHILD SUPPORT BUDGET BUT I CAN PROVIDER INITIAL HIGH LEVEL COMMENTS FOR EACH PROPOSAL- WITH REGARDS TO THE PAST THROUGH PROPOSAL. GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL REFLECTS ONE PASTOR OPTION WHERE THE STATE DOES WAS PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED WOULD MAXIMIZE THE FEDERAL FLEXIBILITY WHEN IT COMES TO THE PASTOR AMOUNT FOR FORMER CAL WORKS% FAMILIES OR FAMILIES THAT PREVIOUSLY RECEIVED CAL WORKS- COULD TEND TO BE LOW INCOME FAMILIES I'M ALTERNATIVE POP THROUGH OPTIONS INCLUDE INCREASING THE AMOUNT OF CHILD SUPPORT PAYMENTS FOR CURRENT CAL WORKS FAMILIES THOSE THAT ARE CURRENTLY RECEIVING- CAL WORKS CASH EIGHT ALTERNATELY WE BELIEVE THAT THE PASSED THROUGH FRAMEWORK THAT THE LEGISLATURE DOCKS SHOULD REALLY REFLECT ITS OWN GOALS. I'M FOR EXAMPLE IF THE LEGISLATURE WANTED TO MINIMIZE THE PAST THEIR DIFFERENCES BETWEEN CURRENT AND FORMER CAL WORKS FAMILIES WELL AT THE SAME TIME MAXIMIZE THE NUMBER OF LOW INCOME CHILDREN AND FAMILIES THAT RECEIVE ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS IT COULD INCREASE PASSED THROUGH LEVELS FOR BOTH FORMER. AND CURRENT CAL WORKS FAMILIES. OF SOMETHING THAT THE- WE NEED TO CONSIDER WHAT THAT POLICY OPTION WOULD BE HOW QUICKLY THE PASTOR CHANGES COULD BE IMPLEMENTED AS WAS MENTIONED ANY PASTOR CHANGES FOR CRYING CAL WORKS FAMILIES. COULD NOT BE IMPLEMENTED UNTIL SOMETIME IN TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE JUST DUE TO LIMITATIONS ON IT SYSTEMS RIGHT NOW HOWEVER THAT COULD GIVE THE LEGISLATURE TIME SOME TIME TO CONSIDER. I'M SOME OF THESE OTHER PROGRAMMATIC IMPLICATIONS- SUCH AS WHAT. AN INCREASING CURRENT PASSED THROUGH- FOR POWER EXPAND THESE WOULD MEAN FOR THEIR CHARACTER ELIGIBILITY OR ELIGIBILITY AND OTHER SOCIAL SERVICES PROGRAMS. ADDITIONALLY OF COURSE THE LEGISLATURE- WE NEED TO CONSIDER IT BE INCREASE AN ESTIMATED GENERAL FUND IMPACT. AND OVERALL WE ARE STILL IN THE PROCESS OF ASSESSING THE COST ESTIMATES FOR EACH OF THE COSTS ARE EACH OF THE PAST THROUGH OPTIONS INCLUDING THE GOVERNOR'S. BUDGET PROPOSAL I'M JUST SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD FLAG IS BECAUSE WE CAN'T NECESSARILY GO OFF THE- PASTOR CURRENT COST LEVELS ARE COLLECTION LEVELS BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT- DOES TEND TO INCREASE OR DECREASE WITH CAL WORKS CASELOAD LEVELS- WHICH WE- WERE ESTIMATING. ARE JUST GOING TO INCREASE IN THE FUTURE. I'M MOVING ON TO THE- PROPOSAL FOR THE INCREASED FUNDING ALLOCATION TO LOCAL CHILD SUPPORT AGENCIES ADMINISTRATIVE FUNDING LEVELS WE CONTINUE TO HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE ADMINISTRATION'S FUNDING METHODOLOGY. AND THAT IT DOES NOT FULLY INCENTIVIZE THE ADOPTION OF PROGRAM EFFICIENCIES THAT COULD ALSO HAVE THE EFFECT OF REDUCING COST PRESSURES AND FREE UP EXISTING BONDS. MORE OVER WE HAVE A CONCERN THAT THE FUNDING METHODOLOGY I MAY NOT REFLECT ACTUAL FUNDING NEEDS. I'M GIVEN THAT PROGRAM UP FOR OPERATIONS HAVE ANY CONTINUED TO MOVE FURTHER AWAY FROM TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN OPERATION LEVELS. WHICH SERVE AS THE BENCHMARK WHEN CALCULATING OVERALL LCSC FUNDING NEEDS WITHIN THE ADMINISTRATION'S FUNDING METHODOLOGY. THUS I'M EVEN IF THE FUNDING METHODOLOGY WAS DEEMED APPROPRIATE AND TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY- THERE'S NO CERTAINTY THAT IT CONTINUES TO ACCURATELY MEASURE CURRENT AND FUTURE LCSC ADMINISTRATIVE FUNDING NEEDS. WITH THAT SAID AND WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE NOT PROVIDE ANY FUTURE ON TUESDAY FUNDING INCREASES UNTIL THE ADMINISTRATION REVISES ITS FUNDING METHODOLOGY TO ADDRESS THESE IDENTIFIED SHORTCOMINGS. SOME CHANGES THAT ARE PRETTY STRAIGHT FORWARD THAT COULD BE ADDED TO THE FUNDING METHODOLOGY RELATIVELY QUICKLY INCLUDE LIMITING THE COST OF DOING BUSINESS ADJUSTMENTS ON THAT ARE INCLUDED IN THE FUNDING METHODOLOGY TO A FIXED RATE AS A WAY TO CONTROL THE STATE SHARE COST- FOR COUNTY CONTROLLED SALARY AND BENEFIT INCREASES AND- SUCH CONTROLS. AND THE STATE SHARE COST ARE COMMON IN OTHER PROGRAMS THAT ARE ADMINISTERED AT THE COUNTY LEVEL. ADDITIONALLY ANOTHER POSSIBLE CHANGE- COULD BE TO ADD ON A ONGOING PROCESS AND WHICH BUDGETS ARE UNDERFUNDED- OF OVERFUNDED LCCS MEETING LCCS THAT HAVE ACCESS FUNDS ABOVE THEIR CALCULATED FUNDING NEEDS CERTAIN TIME PERIOD AND THEN THOSE EXCESS FUNDS ARE REDISTRIBUTED TO UNDERFUNDED ALSEA. SA- I'M HAPPY TO GO TO DO BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT- KRISTIN FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES WAS ALSO GONNA PRESENT. ON THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE AND OUR INITIAL HIGH LEVEL COMMENTS ON THAT WAS WE'RE STILL REVIEWING IT WAS JUST RELEASED ON FRIDAY BUT TWO THINGS WOULD FLAG FOR THE LEGISLATURE NOW IS- REQUESTING A SUMMARY OF THIS STAKEHOLDER FEEDBACK THAT WAS COLLECTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES- AND JUST REQUESTING INFORMATION ON HOW THOSE- ON HOW THE PROPOSED LANGUAGE DOES OR DOES NOT. ADDRESS THOSE STAKEHOLDER FEEDBACK THAT CAME UP- BUT ALSO ONE THING THAT WE WILL BE LOOKING FOR IN THE LANGUAGE IS IDENTIFYING WHETHER THERE ARE CERTAIN AREAS WHERE IT MAKES SENSE FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO ADOPT MORE DETAILED LANGUAGE. AROUND THE NEW CRITERIA THAT CAN BE CONSIDERED WHEN ESTABLISHING A CHILD SUPPORT ORDER AND THIS IS MORE FOR THE PURPOSES OF ENSURING STANDARDISED APPROACH- AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE CRITERIA FOR ALL FAMILIES ACROSS THE STATE. THANK YOU. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH- TRUE DON'T STEP BACK BUDGET JUST TO SEE WITH YOU EARLIER- THE WOMAN TARA FOR THE PASSED THROUGH. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THERE ARE BASICALLY TWO TWO PARTS OF FAMILIES ON CAL WORKS A POST CAL WORKS. ON EITHER LEVEL OF THOSE AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THE COMPLICATIONS OF TRYING TO GIVE IT TO PEOPLE WHO ARE CURRENTLY ON CAL WORKS BUT ARE WE LOOKING AT LEVEL OF NEED FOR THE AMOUNT OF THAT PASSED THROUGH OR OR THEY'RE PRIORITIZING. PEOPLE WITH HIGHER LEVEL OF NEEDS OR IS THERE JUST NOT THE DATA TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT LEVEL OF. CRITERIA. MY UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THE- PROPOSAL FOR A BI INCREASING PASTOR FOR FORMER CAL WORKS FAMILIES. IS IT WE HAVE TO TREAT ALL FAMILIES WELL IT'S KIND OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THEIR CONDITION IS IF YOU'RE GOING TO. INCREASE THE PASSED THROUGH YOU HAVE TO DO IT EQUALLY- SO IF YOU'RE IF IT WILL WILL BE WILLING TO FORGIVE OUR SHARE OF THAT PAYMENT IF THE STATE DOES THE SAME AND THEY PASSED THROUGH THE EXACT SAME AMOUNT TO FAMILIES- HOWEVER IN YOUR CONVERSATIONS ABOUT MAYBE HOW DO CURRENT. CAL WORKS FAMILIES COMPARED TO FORMER CAL WORKS FAMILIES. BOTH ARE LOW INCOME. HOWEVER BASED OFF OF. INCOME DATA THAT WE RECEIVED FROM THAT- DEPARTMENT OF CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES A FEW YEARS AGO IT DOES SEEM LIKE. CURRENT CAO WORKS FAMILIES TEND TO BE ANY WORSE ECONOMIC POSITION- RELATIVE TO FORMER CAL WORKS FAMILIES- AND IN IN THE IN THE CASE OF FORMER CAL WORKS FAMILIES. OF THE OF THE CARE OF THE FAMILIES THAT WOULD BENEFIT UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. AND MANY OF THEM NO LONGER HAVE AN ACTIVE CHILD SUPPORT ORDER IN PLACE AND THAT COULD BE A SIGN THAT. THE CHILD HAS ALREADY REACHED ADULTHOOD. AND THAT MAKES SENSE BECAUSE THE TYPES OF PAYMENTS THAT WOULD GO TO FAMILIES TYPICALLY ARE THE LAST. PAYMENTS THE LAST BUCKET BUT GETS PAID IN ALL CASES. I'M SO THE CHILD POSSIBLY HAS ALREADY REACHED ADULTHOOD BY THE TIME. THOSE PAYMENTS ARE BEING MADE- VERSES WITH THE CURRENT COVERAGE FAMILY WE KNOW THAT THERE'S A CHILD IN THAT HOUSEHOLD TODAY. I'M SO DEPENDING ON THE LEGISLATURE'S CALLS YOU CAN STRUCTURE IN A WAY WHERE PERHAPS YOU ARE. PRIORITIZING ARE BENEFITING FAMILIES THAT YOU DEEM ARE EITHER IN A MORE NEED RELATIVE I BASED OFF OF THEIR RELATIVE ECONOMIC SITUATION OR RELATIVE TO THE FAMILY THE HOUSEHOLD COMPOSITION AS THEIR CHILD- IN THE HOUSEHOLD X. SENTARA. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH IS THAT VERY HELP- DIRECTOR DAVID ON THE L. CSA FUNDING- ARE YOU LOOKING AT DIFFERENT SORTS OF OBJECTIVES TO BE ABLE TO. MAKE THOSE DECISIONS. YES THEY ARE OUR FIRST INITIATIVE- WHAT THEY OUGHT TO STAY FUNDING WAS TO BRING PARITY TO ALL THE LOCAL CHANNELS FOR AGENCIES ACROSS THE STATE SO THERE ARE SOME VERY WELL FUNDED COUNTIES THERE CELESTE FUNDING COUNTIES THE FUNDING CALCULATOR BRINGS EVERYBODY TO THE MIDDLE TO JACQUI SECOND POINT IS THAT THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF MONEY SUPPOSING EVERYBODY WAS AT THE MIDDLE IS THAT THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF MONEY TO ADEQUATELY FUND THE SOUTHEAST ASIA NOT. THAT'S I THINK WHERE FURTHER ANALYSIS NEEDS TO COME INTO PLAY AND WE HAVE A WAY TO STARTED TO RAMP UP FOUR EIGHT EIGHT A CONTRACT TO DO A LEVEL OR EFFORT STUDY- ON THE CHILD SUPPORT PROGRAM AT THAT POINT IN TIME RIGHT NOW IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER THE LEVEL OF EFFORT IS ACCURATE OR NOT BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T GOTTEN INTO AN EQUAL PLAYING FIELD ACROSS ALL THE LOCAL CHANNELS FOR AGENCIES. SO THAT'S OUR FIRST GOAL WITH THIS IS TO BRING ACROSS THE STATE AND THEN WE WILL ASSESS AND ANALYZE WHETHER WE NEED ADDITIONAL FUNDS TO ADEQUATELY SUPPORT THE ACTIVITIES THE CHILD SUPPORT PROGRAM OR IF THERE'S LESS FUNDS AND ALSO TO TAKE CARE OF THOSE COUNTRIES THAT ARE OVER THE FUNDING TACULAR BRINGING THEM INTO LINE WITH THE FUNDING CHECK LATER AS STANCE TODAY. SO THERE'S CERTAINLY NOTHING IN THE CONVERSATION BUT IT IS THE NEXT STEP THAT WE NEED TO BRING SOME PERISHABLE. TRANSPORTATION JUST CROSS THE STATE. OKAY BUT WE WILL NOT NOT ALL THINGS ARE EQUAL SO TO AND CHECK HIS POINT ABOUT- THERE ARE SOME THAT. YOU KNOW HAVE. OF FUNDING AND THEN OTHERS WITHOUT ENOUGH. DOES IT MAKE SENSE TO BE GIVING THOSE WITH PLENTY OF FUNDING MORE FUNDING. THIS FUNDING THAT ALSO THIS EDITION OF. MONEY THAT WE'RE PROVIDING IS ONLY GOING TO BE UNDERFUNDED COUNTIES NOT PLEASE COUNTIES THAT ARE OVER FUNDED SO YOU JUST BRING THE BOTTOM UP TO ALIGN IT WITH THE FUNDING CALCULATOR. AND WHEN WE HAD- A YEAR AND A HALF AGO WITH AT THE BEGINNING OF THE- OF THE PANDEMIC WE HAD TO REMOVE FUNDING FROM THE CHILD SUPPORT PROGRAM. WE TOOK A LARGER PORTION OF THAT FUNDING FROM THE LARGER FROM THE MORE WEALTH THAN THE CUNTIES THAT A LOWER FUNDING. AND WE'RE CONTINUING TO BRING THE BOTTOM UP SO WE ARE NOT PROVIDING ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO ANY. COUNTY THAT IS OVER THE FUNDING METHODOLOGY OKAY AND THEN GOING FORWARD THEY'LL- WE'RE GONNA TAKE INTO ACCOUNT HOW DO WE KEEP THOSE OVER FRIEND THOSE COUNTIES THAT DO VERY WELL- I KEEP OUR EYE ON THAT AND JUST TO MAKE SURE THE BOTTOM. THE BOTTOM KEEPS UP WITH THE TOP. THAT IS CORRECT AS WE BRING THE PRODUCT TO HAVE PARITY WE ARE EXPECTING THOSE. COUNTIES WITH THE HIGHER FUNDING TO COME INTO LINE WITH THE FUNDING FORMULA. THAT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING WITH THE DECLINING CASELOAD AND INCREASING COSTS FOR SALARIES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS. AND WE'RE NOT SEEN THAT THEY'RE MAKING PROGRESS TOWARDS THAT THAT'S. WHEN WE HAVE THOSE DISCUSSIONS WITH INDIVIDUAL COUNTY. THANK YOU DR ALL I WANT TO RECOGNIZE AND THANK THE PHARMACY CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES FOR THE WORK DONE ON THE LCS A FUNDING METHODOLOGY SELF- I APPRECIATE THE L. A. AS COMMENTS I ALSO WANTED TO RECOGNIZE THAT- DOES NOT THAT MANY YEARS AGO- THAT- WE HAD THIS TREMENDOUS FUNDING DISPARITY BETWEEN COUNTIES THAT CAME OUT OF A FORMULA OR AN EQUATION. THAT WAS ACTUALLY IN EXISTENCE FOR SEVERAL DECADES IN FACT I THINK IT WAS FULLY AND CHILD SUPPORT WAS I THINK IN THE THIRTY GENERAL'S OFFICE AND NOT IN SOCIAL SERVICES AND SO FORTH IN FACT WE HAD A VERY DYSFUNCTIONAL- FUNDING MECHANISM FOR CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES THAT DIDN'T THAT DIDN'T RECOGNIZE THE ACTUAL NEED. AND IN FACT- DEPARTMENTS CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES WORKING WITH COUNTY WITH THE LOCAL CHILD SUPPORT AGENCIES WORKED HARD TO COME TO AN AGREEMENT THAT LED TO MORE FAIRNESS BETWEEN THE COUNTIES- THAT THAT'S WHY WE HAVE THIS FUNDING MECHANISM I CAN APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR PUTTING IN THE FUNDS- TO CAN TO BE SURE WE- WORK OUT THAT ENTIRE AGREEMENT BECAUSE OVER SEVERAL YEARS WILL BRING THE BOTTOM UP AS MENTIONED. AND. AND SO THAT. EACH COUNTY AND EACH LOCALITY WOULD HAVE THE RESOURCES NECESSARY TO ATTICA TO PROPERLY ADMINISTER TO CHILD SUPPORT SERVICE AND IN FACT. BECAUSE OF THAT- I BELIEVE- THAT WE ARE ACTUALLY. HAVING MORE EFFECTIVE COLLECTIONS OF CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES ULTIMATELY IN THE END IT'S NOT ABOUT HOW MUCH MONEY THE- COUNTY THAT THE STATE SPENDING AND HOW MUCH COUNTIES ARE GETTING. AS MUCH AS HOW MUCH OF THE FAMILY'S GETTING RIGHT IN BEING SURE THAT WE DO WHAT WE CAN SUPPORT THE FAMILY SO. I CERTAINLY. CONCUR WITH THE L. A. L. O. THAT DOES WORK WITH MOVING FORWARD YOU KNOW WE WANT TO LOOK AT WHAT SORT OF GUARD RAILS YOU PUT IN PLACE. BUT I ALSO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE FACT THAT AND I WANNA THANK THE GOVERNOR FOR PUTTING THE FUNDING SO WE FULLY WORK OUT FUND THE AGREEMENT THAT WAS COME TO SEVERAL YEARS AGO THAT PROVIDE MORE EQUITABLE FUNDING BETWEEN COUNTIES. THAT WAS AS A RESULT OF A NEGOTIATION. BETWEEN THE STATE AND THE COUNTIES THAT. ACTUALLY THAT ACTUALLY- FINALLY FIXED A PROBLEM THAT GONE ON FOR DECADES CLEARLY DECADES OR A ESSENTIALLY- WHERE WE'VE IT IS FRANKLY HAD A VERY DYSFUNCTIONAL WAY OF DISTURBING THE FUNDS BETWEEN COUNTY FOR SOME GOT WAIT NOW GOT A LOT MORE AND OTHERS GOT. WHAT WE'RE WE'RE TREMENDOUSLY UNDERFUNDED COUNTIES ARE UNDER FUNDED TO BE ABLE TO ADMINISTER CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES. SO WHAT. SO I GUESS I WOULD JUST SAY IS THAT- I APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR PUTTING IN THE MONEY NOW WE HAD A LITTLE PIES WHEN THE COVETED WE WERE AFRAID WE'RE GOING TO HAVE ANOTHER BUDGET DOWN FALL. BUT THAT WE ACTUALLY GET TO THE POINT WHERE WE AGREED TO. AND THEN OF COURSE MOVING FORTY ONE ENSURE WE CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN BALANCE AND APPROPRIATE LEVELS OF FUNDING FOR THE COUNTIES. SO I DO APPRECIATE WHAT'S HERE IN THE LTSA FUNDING METHODOLOGY. THE FULL PASS THROUGH I THINK AGAIN IS. APPRECIATED- ENTER WE'RE HOPING THAT WITH THE FOR PASSED PEOPLE TO BE MORE WILLING THE PPO TO GET. THAT WE'RE GONNA BE A COLLECT MORE MONEY BE. THE PEOPLE FAILURE TO CHILD SUPPORT WILL KNOW THAT THE MONEY IS ACTUALLY GOING TO THEIR CHILD AND NOT JUST TO ADMINISTRATION. I GUESS THE QUESTION I HAVE AND I THINK IF WE TOUCH A LITTLE BIT ON IT IS THAT. AND ACTUALLY I DO I MAKE A COMMENT THAT. I'M ACTUALLY KIND OF HARD TO HEAR THAT THE PEOPLE ARE POST CAL WORKS ARE DOING BETTER BECAUSE THAT MEANS AT LEAST BECAUSE WE GET LIKE YOUR IN CAR WORKS WE DO ALL THAT WE DO JOB TRAINING WE DO A LOT OF OTHER THINGS EDUCATION ETCETERA. SO I'M GLAD TO KNOW THOSE FAMILIES ARE ACTUALLY. DOING SLIDERS ARE BETTER OFF THAN THE ONES ARE CURRENTLY AND THAT MEANS. AT LEAST THAT INTERVENTION DURING THE TIME THEY WEREN'T CAL WORKS OR HELPING THEM OUT. IN AB PUTTING THEM ON A BETTER FOOTING I HOPE- BUT I GUESS THE QUESTION IS THAT- FOR THE FAMILIES THAT ARE CURRENTLY ON CAL WORKS WHAT IS DO DO WE HAVE THE ESTIMATE FOR WHAT THE COST WOULD BE IF WE DID A PASS THROUGH FOR THOSE FAMILIES AS IT. IS A COST PROHIBITIVE I UNDERSTAND OR SOME CHALLENGES YOU KNOW WHETHER IT'S IT OTHER THINGS TO DO THAT BUT- A IS THAT IT IS THERE A COST ISSUE THAT WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT OR IS IT MORE. OF A YOU KNOW IMPLEMENTATION ISSUE. THANK YOU CENTER AND THAT COST FOR PASSING SISTER CASES BE APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED FIFTY NINE DOLLARS. AND A ONE FOR ONE BENEFIT TO THOSE FAMILIES. AND TO FULLY PASSED THAT THROUGH BECAUSE NOT ONLY DO THEY HAVE TO GET THE MONEY WE HAVE TO MAKE THEIR OWN GOVERNMENT HOLE FOR THEIR PORTION OF IT. THE BENEFIT WE HAVE ON THE- THE FORMALLY SUGGESTED SITE IS THAT FOR EVERY. DOLLAR WE'RE LOSING IN RECRUITMENT TWO DOLLARS IS GOING OUT TO THE FAMILIES OF THOSE FOREIGN RELEASED AS A CASES. WE HAVE A STATUTORY AUTHORITY THROUGH THE DEFICIT. REDUCTION ACT TO IMPLEMENT THIS WITHOUT ANY ISSUES FROM THE PRO GOVERNMENT. NEWS OR EXERCISING THEN. AND HAS BEEN OFFICIAL. THERE ARE CONVERSATIONS WITH COLORADO. WHO IS THE ONLY STATE THAT IS CURRENTLY DOING PASSED THE RUN CURRENT SUPPORT CASES. THEY DID NOT ELECT TO DO JUST. THAT THE DISTRIBUTION ON THE FORMALLY SYSTEM CASES SO. IF THE PERSON PAYS IN THE MONTH OF THE OBLIGATIONS DO. BECAUSE AFTER THE FAMILY IF THEY DON'T PAY IT GOES INTO ARREARS. AND THAT ARREARS IS SELECTED. IN THE RETAIN AFTER THE GOVERNMENT. COLORADO IN OUR CONVERSATION HE- SAID HAPPY TO DO IT OVER AGAIN. THEY WOULD HAVE STARTED WITH YOURS AND THEN. THANKS FOR ITS SUPPORT. AS FOR CURRENT SUPPORT ITSELF AND- AND THAT'S I THINK IS A IS A TOUGH FOR NEGOTIATION WHETHER WE CAN DO POLLS OR NOT. BUT WE ALREADY HAVE THE STATE STREET THIRTY G. D. FORMALLY ASSISTED CASES NOW. OKAY AND ARE YOU SENATE BUT HE THAT ARE YOU SAYING YOU DON'T THE STATURE THOUGHT YET THE I MEAN I'VE- FOR. PEOPLE ARE CURRENTLY ON OUR- WELL WE DO IT IT'S JUST THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL NOT WAIVE THEIR PORTIONS SO IN ADDITION TO PASSING THE GRANT THE MONEY THROUGH THE FAMILY WE WILL HAVE TO MAKE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. OTHER OKAY NO I UNDERSTAND IT'S PART OF THE EXPENSE OKAY BECAUSE HE'S A STATUTORY AUTHORITY OVER THE CLEARANCE TILTED TO BACK TO WHETHER TO ATTACH IT TO THE BARRIERS WELL OKAY. WELL THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OKAY LET'S MOVE ON TO- ISSUE UMBER FIVE CHILD SUPPORT BUDGET INVESTMENTS. RIGHT S. SENATOR WE DID TRY TO SAVE A LITTLE BIT ON THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE I'M HAPPY TO GO BACK TO THAT AND HAVE CHRISTIAN TALK ABOUT THAT TOGETHER WE CAN NO ARSENAL TALK ABOUT THAT PLEASE. OKAY KRISTEN GRANT THANK YOU SATURDAY WHEN THE SUBCOMMITTEE- THE INTERNET ITSELF DOES A GREAT JOB OF DESCRIBING THE FINAL RULE WHICH IS THE FLEXIBILITY EFFICIENCY AND MODERNIZATION CHILD SUPPORT ANIMAL THIS WAS FINAL IN DECEMBER TWENTY SIXTEEN AND HAS A NUMBER OF REQUIREMENTS FOR CHILD SUPPORT AGENCIES ACROSS THE NATION. WITH REGARD TO CALIFORNIA WE HAD A FEW BAD REQUIREMENTS BUILT YOU NEEDS ARE DEADLINE FOR THOSE IN SEPTEMBER TWENTY WHEN YOU DUE TO THE CURRENT PANDEMIC AND THERE WERE SOME FEDERAL FLEXIBILITY IS GRANTED TO ASK AND ARE DEADLINE WAS EXTENDED TO SEPTEMBER TWENTY TWENTY FOUR.

INTO ACCOUNT WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT. AND APPLY NOW. WHICH GIVES ON. HE'S ON THINGS IS BASED ON- ECONOMIC RESEARCH INTO IMPACTS. HE ARE PARENTS ABILITY EARN BUT JUST HIS GAME. OR RESIDING IN A COUNTY WHERE THERE IS A HIGHER THAN AVERAGE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE. THAT IS WOULD CONTINUE THAT ROLE WE HAVE IN PLACE THAT WAS BASED ON A WORK FORCE- I AM WORKERS CAME TOGETHER AND CREATED A TOXIC WORK PROGRAM AS WE KNOW IT TODAY THAT BALANCES- I THINK SHE SEES AND YOUR PROCESS WHERE THIS IS ESSENTIALLY A PLACE HOLDER ORDER AND IF WE LATER FIND ACTUAL INCOME FOR THE PARENTS OUR LOCAL AGENCIES ARE THEN REQUIRED TO TAKE THAT CASE TO WORK AND HAVE IT RESET BASED ON THE- ACTUAL AND- OPERATES AS A PLACEHOLDER. WE DO BELIEVE THAT MEETS US FINAL WORLD FIREMEN'S WHILE STILL PRESERVING THE EFFICIENCIES AND THE DUE. PROCESS RIGHTS OF OUR PARENTS. ADDITIONALLY THEY ARE SOME CHANGES WITH REGARDS PERSPIRATION.

I LOST MY BY. S. MANSION ACCOUNT OF AN UPDATE ON- LAST YEAR'S ACTIVITIES. HE DAVID- SO LAST YEAR OUR SCENIC TWENTY TIME PROJECT ON THE BUDGET INCLUDED I'M FIFTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS OR NINETY NINE DOLLARS GENERAL FUND IN ADDITIONAL FUNDING TELL CSAS THIS FUNDING RESTORE STATE WHITE HOUSE YOU SEE FUNDING LEVELS WERE REDUCED IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE FISCAL YEAR AS A RESULT OF COMING NINETY AS DIRECTOR HERE WERE MENTIONED THE HIGHER PROPORTION OF THE REDUCTIONS WERE TAKEN FROM US YES HE'S ABOVE THE FUNDING METHODOLOGY WHEREAS THE RESTORATION. ON MORE ONLY ALLOCATED TO UNDERFUNDED COUNTIES WHICH COUNTIES HAVE BEEN FOCUSED ON USING THE NEW FUNDING TO HIRE ADDITIONAL STAFF AND BRING UP THEIR CASE THE STAFF OPERATIONS IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE FISCAL YEAR HOUSE YES HE'S RAMPED UP THEIR HIRING IMPLEMENTED EFFORTS TO REACH AS MANY FOLKS AS POSSIBLE AND RECRUITMENT EFFORTS DAY POSTED ON LINKED IN ANOTHER ON APPROVING WEBSITES AND SERVICES SOME COUNTY'S AGAIN SURGERY EITHER SIRENS CONCERNING OPTIONS TO MAKE THEIR POSITIONS MORE ATTRACTIVE AND COMPETITIVE. DURING THIS TIME ASSISI'S EXPERIENCE HIGH LEVELS OF STAFFING ATTRITION AS A AS A RESULT OF RETIREMENTS AND EMPLOYEES LEAVING FOR OTHER JOB OPPORTUNITIES FOR BETTER PAY AND BENEFITS IN LINE WITH THE NINTH NATIONAL TREND OF A TIGHT LABOR MARKET HOWEVER WE ARE BEGINNING TO SEE THE COUNTIES OVERCOME THESE INITIAL CHALLENGES AS MORE POSITIONS ARE BEING HELD JEFF ATTRITION HAS MODERATED IN OVERALL NET POSITIONS AT THE US UC'S ARE BEGINNING TO INCREASE DECSS WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR AND REPORT THIS INFORMATION IN ITS QUARTERLY SR PORT WE ARE HOPEFUL AND BELIEVE THAT THE COUNCIL MAKE SIGNIFICANT. PROGRESS IN THE SECOND HALF OF THIS YEAR. THANK YOU. PARTY FINANCING. YES NO CONCERNS WITH THE DESCRIBED IMPLEMENTATION THANK YOU SO MUCH. LMAO YES AS THE DEPARTMENT MENTIONED- SOME L. C. ESSAYS SINCE THE RESTORATION OF THESE BONDS ON THEIR FUNDING LEVELS HAVE ACTUALLY DECREASED- THIS SEEMS TO BE DUE TO- ED TOUGH LABOR MARKET SAID NOT AS MANY PEOPLE FLYING FOR OUR FOR POSITIONS BUT THEN ALSO AS WAS HIGHLIGHTED AND THE SRO REPORT THAT THE DEPARTMENT SUBMITTED BACK IN DECEMBER. I'M SOME PEOPLE ACTUALLY- REJECTING THE JOB OFFERS- AND A HIGH LEVEL A HIGH NUMBER OF RETIREMENTS AS WELL- SO WE'LL CONTINUE TO MONITOR STOPPING TRENDS- IN PARTICULAR AS IT PERTAINS TO UNDERFUNDED ALL CSAS AND TO THEIR ABILITY TO SPEND SHOULD THE PRIOR RESTORED FUNDING- AS IT MADE THAT HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR THEIR- LEVEL OF READINESS FOR AN ADDITIONAL INFLUX OF RESOURCES. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH- DO WE DO KEEP TRACK OF I'M SURE YOU KEEP TRACK OF BUT AGAIN REGIONS THAT ARE. HAVING MORE DIFFICULTY THAN OTHERS AND IF SO IS THERE A TRIGGER AT WHICH POINT THE STATE WOULD HAVE TO COME IN AND HELP IF PEOPLE WEREN'T ABLE TO. TO DO THE BASIC FUNCTIONS OF GETTING THE CHILD SUPPORT. OUT SO AT THIS TIME THAT THE BASIC FUNCTIONS OF THE TRUCKS WERE PROGRAM ARE STRAIGHT AWAY THEY'RE USED TO- DELIVERING THE SERVICES THEY'RE JUST NOT. CAPABLE OF DELIVERING THE SAME QUALITY AS THEIR HIGHER FROM THE COUNTIES MIGHT OTHERWISE BE ABLE TO DO. SO AS THEY'RE RAMPING UP IT JUST GIVES THEM. A REDUCED CASELOAD- CASE WORKER- RATIO WHICH ALLOWS THEM TO BE MORE ENGAGING MORE SUPPORT OF THE CONSTITUENTS THAT THEY START. BUT ALSO TO THE POINT OF AS MORE FUNDING COMES IN. THE STRUGGLE MORE TO GET THAT THAT FUNDING OUT- SO WE'RE JUST MAKING SURE WE KEEP AN EYE ON THE COUNTIES THAT HAVE MORE DIFFICULTY THAN SOME OF THE MORE WELL FUNDED COUNTIES. YOU KNOW STRUGGLE GETTING THE FINDING OUT REAL ESTATE WHY DISBURSING UNIT- THAT COVERS THE ENTIRE STATE AND THAT'S A CONTRACT THAT WE HOST ALL THE MONEY COMES IN THE STATE RIGHT SPACE MEAN AND THEY JUST GIVE IT OUT SO. THE IMPACT ON THE LC STAYS IS WORKING WITH THE INDIVIDUAL ON CASE BY CASE BASIS TO ADDRESS ANY. ISSUES OR CHALLENGES THAT THEY'RE HAVING IN PAYING THEIR CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES SO- PAYING CHILD SUPPORT SO IT'S REALLY ABOUT THE HANDS ON SUPPORT THE LC STAYS AGO ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE.

I THINK. DIRECTOR JOHNSON ARE YOU COMING. YEAH GOOD GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRED BY SENATOR CAN CAN JOHNSON DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES A LOT AT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THIS AFTERNOON IN TERMS OF OUR CASH IN SUPPORT OF SERVICES AND CAL WORKS IN THE CHANGES THAT WE'VE BEEN MAKING IMPROVEMENTS TO STRENGTHEN THAT PROGRAM. AS WELL AS OUR FOOD ASSISTANCE AND OUR HOUSING SO I WILL START WITH TURNING IT OVER TO OUR CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR CHEN CHIU CHOI. WELCOME DEPUTY. THANK YOU DIRECTOR JOHNSON AND GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS IT'S WONDERFUL TO BE HERE WITH YOU THIS AFTERNOON I'M THE FIRST QUESTION THAT YOU ASKED OF US AND WITH RESPECT TO THE COW WORKS ITEMS IS TO JUST PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF THEIR PROPOSED TWENTY TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE CAO WORKS BUDGET AND TO OFFER A DESCRIPTION OF THE SIGNIFICANT AUGMENTATIONS INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. I AS YOU KNOW WELL THE COW WORKS PROGRAM IS THE CORNERSTONE OF THE STATE SAFETY NET FOR LOW INCOME FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN. PROVIDING CASH ASSISTANCE AND EMPLOYMENT AND EDUCATION RELATED SERVICES AND SUPPORTS INCLUDING CHILD CARE. A TOTAL PROPOSED BUDGET FOR THE PROGRAM. IN TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE INCLUDES SIX POINT NINE BILLION DOLLARS. IN A MIX OF THE FEDERAL AND STATE FUNDS. THE MOST RECENT ACTUAL DATA REFLECTS THAT THE PROGRAM WAS SERVING AROUND THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND FAMILIES. AS WE'LL TALK ABOUT MORE WITH THE NEXT QUESTION- WE ARE PROJECTING FOR THE PROGRAM TO GROW BY OVER TWO. AND TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. WITH RESPECT TO CASH ASSISTANCE WE ARE PROJECTING AN INCREASE OF A SEVEN POINT 1% TO THE MAXIMUM GRANTS. THIS WOULD BRING THE MAXIMUM GRANT FOR A FAMILY OF THREE AND A HIGH COST COUNTY TWO NINE HUNDRED AND NINETY ONE DOLLARS A MONTH. IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE AS WE LOOK AT THE TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE BUDGET THAT THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET INCLUDED A NUMBER OF CHANGES AND SIGNIFICANT AUGMENTATIONS RELATIVE TO THE COW WORKS PROGRAM. THAT WE ARE IMPLEMENTING THIS YEAR AND IN SOME INSTANCES THAT DON'T BEGIN UNTIL THE BUDGET YEAR IN TERMS OF THEIR EFFECTIVE TIMING. A COUPLE OF KEY EXAMPLES THERE INCLUDE THE EXTENSION OF TIME LIMIT FROM FORTY EIGHT TO SIXTY MONTHS. WHICH WILL BE EFFECTIVE MAY OF THIS YEAR I INCREASES TO THE EARNED INCOME DISREGARD PREGNANCY RELATED BENEFITS. AND ASSISTANCE TO FAMILIES TRYING TO REUNIFY WITH THEIR CHILDREN THROUGH THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM. IMPLICIT BIAS TRAINING FOR COUNTY CAO WORKS STAFF. AND BENEFITS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO AFGHAN MILITARY AND PAROLEES. SO WE ARE WORKING DILIGENTLY TO IMPLEMENT ALL OF THESE RECENT CHANGES AND INVESTMENTS WHILE ALSO LOOKING AHEAD TO THE TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE BUDGET- WITHOUT I WILL PAUSE AND SEE IF YOUR- QUESTIONS ON THIS HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW AND THEN FROM THERE. CRISTINA MESSA WHO IS THE CHIEF OF OUR CAO WORKS AND FAMILY RESILIENCE BRANCH IS PREPARED TO ANSWER THE NEXT QUESTIONS FOR THIS ITEM. I THINK WE'LL MOVE ON YEAH OKAY THE QUESTIONS PLEASE. OKAY THEN I'LL TURN IT OVER TO THE SOFA THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH SENATORS THINK INTENDED AFTERNOON. I'M AND TO THE NEXT QUESTION IS SPECIFIC TO THAT HOW WORKS HE SPOKE. AYE WELL CAO WORKS CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE A DECLINE IN OERALL QUISO THROUGHOUT THE FIRST HALF OF THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE CALENDAR YEAR- THE COLORS PROGRAM DID EXPERIENCE A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN APPLICATION VOLUME DURING THE LATE SUMMER. AND FALL MONTHS OF LOS CALENDAR YEAR. AROUND THE SAME TIME THAT MANY CALIFORNIANS EXPERIENCE A LOSS OF SIGNIFICANT UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS. THE DEPARTMENT WORKED CLOSELY WITH THE FOLKS OVER AT TV TO ENSURE. THAT PARTICIPANTS THAT WORK THE THING THAT BENEFIT CLASS HAD ACCESS TO THE RESOURCES AND INFORMATION NEEDED I HAD TO APPLY FOR SAFETY NET BENEFITS WHICH OF COURSE IS INCLUSIVE. OF BOTH CALFRESH IN COLOR. WE ARE STILL AT THIS TIME WAITING ON FINAL DATA TO DEMONSTRATE WHETHER OR NOT- THAT INCREASE THAT WERE EXPERIENCING AN APPLICATION VOLUME CONTRIBUTED TO AN INCREASE IN CASELOAD. BUT WE ANTICIPATE THAT WE WILL SEE AN INCREASE ONCE THAT DATA IS AVAILABLE ON. WE ALSO KNOW NOW THAT DENIALS CROSS CAL WORKS FOR APPLICATIONS THAT WERE PROCESSED. DURING THE PANDEMIC WERE HEAVILY DENIED DUE TO BEING OVER INCOME. HOWEVER WE ONLY HAVE DATA AVAILABLE THROUGH JULY OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE SO WERE UNABLE TO SPEAK. AT LEAST AT THIS TIME IF THAT TREND- REMAINS DURING THAT BENEFIT QUITE YET. CURRENTLY OUR CASELOAD IS REPRESENTATIVE OF JUST ABOUT THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND FAMILIES AS A GINGER SHARED- BUT AGAIN WE'RE WAITING ON MORE OF THAT ACCURATELY THAT- A FORMER COUNTY TO DEMONSTRATE THAT HE SAID INCREASES THAT WERE ANTICIPATING. OUT WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO EXIT RATE. AS THE KING SAUD HELD A FAIRLY STEADY THROUGHOUT THIS PAST YEAR. MEDIA LAST COMPONENT OF COLOR HE SAID THAT WE WANTED TO SHARE- WE WERE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT GOOD CAUSE DURING THE PANDEMIC FOR MANY OF OUR WELFARE TO WORK PARTICIPANTS- AND SO WE EXPERIENCE. IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE DECLINE IN SANCTIONED HE'S LOADED- WHICH NOW MAKES UP JUST ABOUT 3% OF OUR TOTAL KEYSTONE ARTWORK. BECAUSE THERE IS BUSY MAKING SIDE QUESTIONS AS KICK OFF. PERFECT THANK YOU I THE NEXT QUESTION IS DIRECTLY PERTAINING TO FUNDING FOR HOW WORKS IN THE FUNDING CHANGES AS TO THE FUNDING FOR HOW WORKS ELIGIBILITY ADMINISTRATION- IS DETERMINED BY A NEW METHODOLOGY THAT WAS DEVELOPED IN COORDINATION. WITH OUR COUNTY PARTNERS IN THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN TWENTY NINETEEN FISCAL YEAR AT THE VERY HIGH CASELOAD OF FORECASTS DURING THE PANDEMIC I DID NOT MATERIALIZE AND CAL WORKS ALTHOUGH A FUNDING AGREEMENTS FOR COUNTIES WERE MAINTAINED ARE PROVIDED IN BOTH THE- NINETEEN TWENTY AND TWENTY TO TWENTY TWENTY ONE FISCAL YEARS. AGO THE CASELOAD IS PROJECTED TO INCREASE IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWENTY TWO TO TWENTY TWENTY THREE IT IS NOT INCREASING AND KNOCKED ME CLEAN ALL OF THOSE INCREMENTS INCREASES THAT WERE PROVIDED IN THE. TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO TWENTY TWENTY TWO FISCAL YEAR. AT LEAST ON THE UPPER METHOD- THE CASELOAD WOULD NEED TO BE FORECASTED. TO INCREASE TO ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED AND SIX THOUSAND CAL WORKS FAMILIES AT TWO NINETEEN THE FUNDING LEVEL THAT WAS PROVIDED IN THAT. AT TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWENTY TWO FISCAL YEAR. AS A CALL YET TO THAT POINT I THIS IS NOT INCLUSIVE OF THE ON GOING TO INCREASE AND BE SPENDING- PROVIDED BY THE LEGISLATURE TO COUNCILS. I THINK HOW WORK SINGLE ALLOCATION FUNDS EMPLOYMENT SERVICES ARE THE ELIGIBILITY ADMINISTRATION ALEC HOW LEARN INTENSIVE CASE MANAGEMENT- OF THE TOTAL SINGLE ALLOCATION FUNDING FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO FISCAL YEAR. 63% TWENTY EMPLOYMENT SERVICES. 36% FOR THAT ELIGIBILITY ADMINISTRATION AND THEN THE REMAINING 1% WERE DISTRIBUTED TO COUNTY. WE ALSO WANTED TO NOTE THAT- WHILE THIS IS DESCRIPTIVE IN TERMS OF FUNDING FOR THE SINGLE ALLOCATION BUT NOT FUNDED THROUGH SINGLE ALLOCATION BUT FUNDED SEPARATELY ARE MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE SERVICES FAR HOW WORKS FAMILIES AS WELL AS MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE SERVICES FOR- PROVIDED THEIR INDIAN HEALTH CLINIC. IT'S ALSO NOT INCLUSIVE OF THE EXPANDED SUBSIDIZE EMPLOYMENT PROGRAM WHICH IS- THE PROGRAM IN WHICH WERE ABLE TO PAY THE WAGES OF PARTICIPANTS FOR ENGAGE IN WORK EXPERIENCE OPPORTUNITIES THE WELFARE TO WORK. IT ALSO DOES NOT INCLUDE THE FAMILY STABILIZATION- A SERVICES THAT WE PROVIDE OUR CAL WORKS FAMILIES BY DOES NOT INCLUDE THE HOUSING SUPPORT PROGRAM PROGRAM. OR THE HOME VISITING PROGRAM THAT WE HAVE AND CAL WORKS IN FOR HOME VISITING PROGRAM IT SEPARATELY BY THEY FOR BOTH THE HOME VISITS THEMSELVES AS WELL AS THE ADMINISTRATIVE. PORTION AT A VISITING. BUT THAT OPPOSE THIS. AT THERE'S QUESTIONS ON THE FUNDING ITEMS. DOES THAT COMPLETE CAL WORKS PRESENTATION VERY MUCH I THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE. NO COMMENTS AT THIS TIMEBUT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS DELEO. GOOD AFTERNOON RYAN ANDERSON WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE JUST LIKE TO. ELABORATE ON ONE POINT THAT THE DEPARTMENT MADE ABOUT RECENT CASE LAW DYNAMICS POST PANDEMIC I KNOW THIS IS BEEN A BIG FOCUS OF THE COMMITTEE HAS ALSO BEEN A BIG FOCUS FOCUS OF OUR OFFICE. JUST TO REVIEW WE ALL EXPECTED AT THE OUTSET OF THE PANDEMIC THAT HAS UNEMPLOYMENT INCREASED CASE LOAD WOULD INCREASE IN SOME PROPORTION TO THAT THAT THAT'S HISTORICALLY WHAT WE'VE SEEN. AND INSTEAD OF GETTING AN INCREASE WE'D GUIDE HISTORIC DECREASE- FROM THE SUMMER OF TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY THROUGH NEARLY THE MOST RECENT DATA- SEPTEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME INVESTIGATING. WELL WHAT IS THE CAUSE OF THIS DECREASE IN PART BECAUSE WE WERE CONCERNED ABOUT WHETHER POLICY MEASURES WE COULD TAKE TO ENSURE THAT ELIGIBLE FAMILIES WHO ARE NOT. REACHING THE PROGRAM COULD BE REACHED IN PART BECAUSE IT'S A- FORECASTING A DILEMMA RIGHT- WE HAD THIS QUESTION OF AT WHAT POINT WITH THE DATA TO CATCH UP WITH HISTORIC NORMS IN THE CASE OF START GROWING AGAIN. WE KNOW THE ADMINISTRATION ALSO CONDUCTED THEIR OWN INVESTIGATION OF THOSE QUESTIONS INDEPENDENTLY WE BOTH I. THINK THROUGH A PROCESS OF ELIMINATION. I CAME UP WITH A BEST GUESS B. AND THEN THIS WILL SOMEHOW TO THE EXTRA- FINANCE. AND ECONOMIC SUPPORT OFFERED BY THE STATE AND ESPECIALLY BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HOUSE PANDEMIC. ESPECIALLY THE EXPIRATION OF ENHANCED UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS AND THIS IS BOTH THE SIX HUNDRED DOLLAR A WEEK- ARE I BENEFIT AND THE STAFF WAS MEANT OF THE CANON. PANDEMIC UNEMPLOYMENT ASSISTANCE WHICH ALLOWED FOR THE FIRST TIME SELF EMPLOYED WORKERS TO RECEIVE YOU AYE BENEFITS THOSE WITH EXPIRED IN SEPTEMBER. IN BOTH OUR OFFICE IN THE ADMINISTRATION. ARE PROJECTING THAT WITH THAT EXPIRATION WE WOULD SEE SOME RETURN TO THIS HISTORICAL NORMS A- RESUMPTION OF GROWTH IN THE PROGRAM. AS A RESULT DESPITE THE FACT THAT RECENTLY OUR TWO OFFICES HAVE HAD WILDLY DIVERGING PROJECTIONS FOR THIS CASE THOUGH. I CURRENTLY WE'RE RIGHT ON THE SAME PAGE OF COURSE THE BIG QUESTION IS WELL. ARE WE BOTH RIGHT- THE INITIAL DATA. IT'S NOT REALLY CLEAR IT IS TRUE THAT IN THE MOST RECENT DATA IN SEPTEMBER AND OCTOBER OF LAST YEAR- CASELOAD STARTED GROWING AGAIN AND THAT'S THE FIRST TIME WE'VE SEEN IT BROWN. AGAIN SINCE THE FIRST MONTHS OF THE PANDEMIC BUT THE GROWTH WAS RELATIVELY MODEST ABOUT TWO THOUSAND CASES A YEAR BOTH OUR OFFICES WERE EXPECTING SOMETHING CLOSER TO TEN THOUSAND CASE IT TEN THOUSAND CASES A MONTH. HI WE'RE STILL WAITING ON MORE RECENT DATA SO THIS UNTESTED AS ASSUMPTION REMAINS TO BE PROVEN BUT- INITIAL DATA SOMEONE ENCOURAGING BUT THAT'S THE ONLY POINT I NEED TO MAKE RIGHT NOW. BUT HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU YES WE ALL ON THAT FOR ESPECIALLY IF YOU TIME. AT FOOD OR TALKING TO OUR A MISDEMEANOR HUGE NEED AROUND BASIC RESOURCES AND SO IT IT IT REMAINS. VERY CURIOUS TO A TO ALL OF US IN YOUR RIGHT IT REALLY IT HAMPERS PROJECTIONS- IF YOU'RE NOT QUITE SURE IF IT'S GOING TO COME BACK OR NOT- SO I GUESS I GUESS. SO ARE YOU COMFORTABLE WITH THE WITH THE CURRENT. TWELVE POINT SIX INCREASE THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS PROJECTING. YES OUR OFFICE. INDEPENDENTLY PROJECTED A VERY SIMILAR CASELOAD INCREASE SO. WE HAVE NO PROBLEMS WITH THE-ADMINISTRATION'S PROJECTIONS AT THIS TIME OF COURSE. FOR ALL REVISIT THIS AGAIN IN MAY WHEN WILL HAVE MORE RECENT DATA. FFESTINIOG PRINT. THANK YOU IF YOU QUESTIONS SO ONE IS THAT- YOU KNOW YOU TALK ABOUT OF COURSE UNEMPLOYMENT- TO THESE ENDING IN SEPTEMBER ALSO- THE CHILD TAX CREDIT ENDED- JUST ENDED SO TO WHAT DEGREE DO YOU THINK IT IS THAT SORT FACT I'M SURE YOU FACTORED IN BUT- HOW MUCH OF IMPACT YOU THINK THAT'S GOING TO HAVE ON CAL WORKS AND ROMAN WHICH- WHICH OFTEN. INVOLVES FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN TREMENDOUS IMPACT I'D BE IN INTERIOR NEARLY EVERY CAL WORKS FAMILY IF NOT EVERY- EXCEPTING MAYBE THOSE THAT ARE AFFECTED BY IT SOME IMMIGRATION- EXCLUSIONS SHOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR THE EXPANDED- CHILD TAX CREDIT THAT WE SAW. THROUGHOUT THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE YEAR- THAT WAS THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH THAT COMPARES VERY FAVORABLY AT THE PER CHILD TO ATTACK COMPARES VERY FAVORABLY TO THE ASSISTANCE THAT'S OFFERED BY CAL WORKS ITSELF SO. POTENTIALLY A VERY ATTRACTIVE ALTERNATIVE TO BEING ENROLLED IN THE PROGRAM- IT CERTAINLY A GOOD HYPOTHESIS THAT WITH THAT EXPIRATION IN DECEMBER WE WOULD SEE SOME ADDITIONAL IMPACT ON CASELOAD. I THINK THE COMPLICATING FACTOR THERE MIGHT BE- THE ONE PAPER MANY OF THESE FAMILIES WERE ELIGIBLE DID IN FACT RECEIVE IT AND ALL A LOT OF TIMES THAT DEPENDS ON WELL DID THEY FILE TAXES IN THE PRIOR YEAR A LOT OF CAL WORKS FAMILIES REPORTED ZERO EARNED INCOME. AND A LOT OF THOSE FAMILIES DON'T FILE TAX RETURNS AND THUS WHEN AND IF IT FOR ME BUT I GUESS THE QUESTION IS THE AMOUNT OF PAPERWORK TO FILE TAXES HOW'S THAT WAY AGAINST ABOUT PEOPLE WORK IT TAKES ABOUT THE CALYX RIGHT. HOW MUCH EFFORT IT TAKES ALL RIGHT IT'S A GOOD QUESTION YEAH. THE OTHER THE OTHER- ACTUALLY QUESTION I ASK IS THAT- AND AGAIN APPRECIATE THE PRESENTATION FROM THE ADMINISTRATION'S RECORD THAT SO- WE DID. SO MANY ISSUES THAT CAME BACK AS THEY CAME UP SEVERAL YEARS AGO WAS- AFTER WE GET THROUGH THE GREAT RECESSION WAS. THE SINGLE ALLOCATION FORMULA ISSUE. THAT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IS TIMES WOULD BE TREMENDOUSLY UNDERFUNDED FOR THEIR STAFF AND THEN WHEN THE RECESSION HIT SUDDENLY HAVE TO YOU KNOW UP. UP FUND AND THEN DON'T HIRE PEOPLE AT CETERA. I KNOW IN THIS CASE HERE BASED ON THAT TESTIMONY FROM THE ADMINISTRATION YELLED THAT. REDUCTION OF FIFTY FIVE MILLION IS DUE TO I GUESS. THE INTENSIFICATION THE DIDN'T WAY OUT FORTUNATELY ACTUALLY- THAT WE WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE A LOT MORE PEOPLE AND ROLLED- WHEN KOBE HEAD- BUT I GUESS MY QUESTION IS THAT. THE OF THE REFORMS THAT WE MAY TWO. I USED TO COUNTY ADMINISTRATION AND IN TERMS OF WHAT WE FIND FOR YOU KNOW SINGLE ALLOCATION AND BE SURE TO BE ADEQUATE FUND THE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR- THE COUNTY ELIGIBILITY WORKERS AND OTHER WORKERS WO ADMINISTER CAL WORKS IS THAT WORKING APPROPRIATELY ARE WE HAVING LARGE AND THAT THIS IS AN 8% REDUCTION FROM I UNDERSTAND FROM THIS BUDGET. IT ARE WE HAVING ENOUGH STABILITY IN THE LEVEL FUNDING WE'RE PROVIDING TO COUNTIES TO MAINTAIN THEIR- THE INFRASTRUCTURE NECESSARY SO THAT WE CAN CONSISTENTLY ADMINISTERS PROGRAMS PARTICULARLY ELDERLY UPSWINGS IN THE ECONOMY THINGS GET BETTER AND THEN THERE'S LESS FUNDING YEAH SO I JUST WANTED TO TOUCH ON THAT- SINCE WE DID MAKE THOSE REFORMS MANY YEARS AGO NOW WE'RE GOING TO THE CYCLE WITH COKE. I GUESS THAT'S THE QUESTION PERHAPS FOR BOTH ADMINISTRATION L. A. L. THEY WANT TO COMMENT ON THAT. THANK YOU ADEGOKE THE- FACT ADDS THAT JUSTIN FREITAS WANTS TO JUMP AND GO AHEAD. AND ANNOUNCE FILE. YES RAISED FOR YOU DIRECTOR- JOHNSON I THINK YOU'RE RECORDS AND JUST A KIND OF ANSWERING THE BIT ACROSS IS. IT IS NOT NECESSARILY FOLDER. IN THE FUNDING THAT- THAT METHODOLOGY YOU MAY WAS A GREETED. BY THE LEGISLATURE IN THE MID. TWENTY EIGHTEEN. THEN IN THE TWENTY ONE BY ACT. THERE WERE- TO DIFFERENT ON. TO THIS YOUNG CATION FUNDING ONE WAY THAT- A ONE TIME AUGMENTATION. OF AROUND TWENTY SEVEN MILLION AND THEN THERE IS A SECOND AUGMENTATION IT WAS AN ONGOING AUGMENTATIONS THE BASE. SO WHAT YOU'RE REALLY SEEING HERE IS- IS- AND- A COMMITMENT AND AN END TO WHAT THE CURRENT METHODOLOGY IS. TEN YEARS SEEN A DIFFERENCE IN THE BUDGET YEAR PROJECTION JUST BECAUSE THERE WAS AN ADDITIONAL ONE TIME. INCLUDED IN THE BUDGET ACTS. SO BASED ON THE WEIGHT SHE SERVE HIS BEEN TRAINING AND WORKING IN THAT THIS THIS METHODOLOGY FOR THE ADMIN FUNDING IS. IS APPEARING TO BE IN LINE. WITH WHAT I COUNTY NEEDS TO BE AND THEN AGAIN DIRECTOR JOHNSON IF THERE'S ANYTHING. THAT YOU WANT TO ADD ON THE- I THINK I THINK YOU. OKAY AND OUT OF ANY KIND AT ANY COME FROM A. L. YEAH. SENATOR PANDUIT WE THINK YOU'RE ASKING THE CRUCIAL CRUCIAL QUESTION HERE THAT'S IT THERE'S TWO CATEGORIES- ONE IS WHETHER THE SPECIFIC ADJUSTMENT THAT. WAS MADE IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WAS APPROPRIATE JUST BY THE BOOK RIGHT AND WE'RE STILL WORKING THROUGH UNDERSTAND EXACTLY ALL THE MOVING PIECES THERE BUT IT DOES LOOK LIKE. DESPITE HOW AUDIT APPEARS THEY IT WAS APPROPRIATE UNDER THE LETTER OF THE LAW FOR THAT DROPPED TO OCCUR. PERCENT DOES LEAVE OPEN THE FUN TO QUESTION WHICH IS- IS THE FORMULA OPERATING AS INTENDED BUT CERTAINLY ONE OF THE INTENSE OF THE FORMULA AS WE UNDERSTAND IT WAS TO ENSURE THAT CHANGES TO. THIS FUNDING AMOUNT WERE IN LINE BOTH WITH COUNTIES ABILITY TO CHANGE THEIR ADMINISTRATIVE CAPACITY AND ALSO THE CHANGING NEEDS OF THE PROGRAM AND- THAT SECOND POINT DOESN'T APPEAR TO BE ADDRESS WHENEVER YOU HAVE A SITUATION. WHERE FUNDING IS DECREASING AT A TIME WHEN NEED IS INCREASING- THERE'S ALSO JUST YOU KNOW UNDERLYING QUESTIONS ABOUT- WHETHER ON GOING FORWARD THE UNDERLYING FUNDING AMOUNT IS ADEQUATE TO MEET THE NEED WHERE WE'RE STILL WE'RE- WAITING ON ADDITIONAL DATA FROM- COUNTY IS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THAT QUESTION. NOW AFTER IT PRECIADO AND ALSO APPRECIATED MINISTRATION POINTING OUT THAT- PART OF THE QUOTE REDUCTION IS BECAUSE OF AUGMENTATIONS MADE AND- MILLION PRIOR BUDGET SO- BUT I DID I DO HOPE THAT AND YOU KNOW BEGAN THE SYSTEM HAVING BEEN ON THIS COMMITTEE FIRST YET FOR A FEW YEARS THAT- WE ARE. DEVELOPING THE INFRASTRUCTURE SO YOU IN THE BASE FUNDING ETCETERA THAT WE ARE YOU KNOW I'D BE SURE THAT WE MAINTAIN THE APPROPRIATE INFRASTRUCTURE. TO ADMINISTER THIS PROGRAM IN A WAY THAT EVEN WITH FLUCTUATING CASES DUE TO ECONOMIC YOU KNOW AND OTHER REASONS THAT- WE HAVE THE CAPACITY TO SERVE PEOPLE NOW THAT THAT THE BENEFICIARIES AND- THAT- THAT. THAT- YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT WHICH WE PREVIOUSLY DID HAVE WHAT WOULD BE A RAMP UP AND YOU KNOW WIND OUT AND RAMP UP THE MINE DOWN OFTENTIMES IN BOTH THE WINDING UP THE ON RAMP BEING PARTICULARLY IN RAMPING UP WE WERE ALWAYS PLAYING CATCH UP. BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE SUFFICIENT BASE FUNDING AND SO FORTH SO I JUST HOPE THAT AS WE'RE GOING THROUGH THE STORE CONTINUE TO EXAMINE THAT AND MAKING REFINEMENTS. AND OF COURSE I'M SURE WE'LL HEAR FROM STAKEHOLDERS LIKE THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS AND OTHER COMMUNITIES AS WELL FROM THEIR EXPERIENCE HOW THEY FEEL THIS IS WORKING AS WELL SO I APPRECIATE THAT THE ANSWERS TO THAT. I THINK WITH THAT- AT LEAST I THINK I'M DONE WITH CALYXT IN THIS BACK TO YOU OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MY- THE TIME IN THE AFTERNOON. GETTING LET'S TALK A CERTAINLY AN AGAIN I CAN JOHN DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT GOING TO TURN IT OVER TO T. DEPUTY TRAFFIC YOU THINK. THANK DIRECTOR JOHN. AGAIN CHEN. I DEATH DIRECTOR OF THE- SO. THE FIRST QUESTION THAT YOU ASK FOR SO TO CALPERS IN NATURE PROGRAM WAS ALL. FOR AN OVER. OF THE PATELLA BUDGET FOR TWENTY TWO TWENTY- CALFRESH AS YOU KNOW IT'S IS. CAL VERSION OF THE SUPPLEMENTAL NUTRITION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM OR SNAP HISTORICALLY KNOWN AS FOOD STAMPS- AND SOMETIMES STILL REFERRED TO THAT WAY. THE PROGRAM PROVIDES CLOSE TO TEN BILLION DOLLARS AND FEDERALLY FUNDED FOOD ASSISTANCE. TO COMBAT HUNGER AND FOOD INSECURITY AMONG CALIFORNIANS. ANOTHER CRITICAL ASPECT OF OUR SPEAKING THAT. AROUND FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION CALIFORNIANS BENEFIT FROM THIS ESSENTIAL SUPPORT. IN ADDITION TO THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES TO PROVIDE TWO POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN FEDERAL STATE AND COUNTY FUNDS FOR THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE CALFRESH PROGRAM. SOME OTHER CRITICAL ITEMS OF NOTE WITH RESPECT TO NUTRITIONAL PROGRAMS OPERATED BY CDSS AND THE COUNTIES IN THE TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE BUDGET. INCLUDES SOME ADDITIONAL DETAILS RELATED TO THE EXPANSION OF THE CALIFORNIA FOOD ASSISTANCE PROGRAM OR C. FACT. THE SEAT BACK PROGRAM PROVIDES FOOD ASSISTANCE TO INDIVIDUALS CURRENTLY WHO ARE INELIGIBLE FOR CALFRESH BECAUSE OF CHANGES THAT WERE MADE IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX TO EXCLUDE CERTAIN NON CITIZENS FROM FEDERAL FOOD ASSISTANCE. LAST YEAR THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE LEGISLATURE AGREED TO EXPAND THE FACT TO ADDITIONAL CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS WHO ARE INELIGIBLE FOR CALIBRATION REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRATION STATUS PROPOSING SOME ADDITIONAL DETAILS RELATIVE TO THAT EXPANSIONAND MORE SPECIFICALLY OUR PROPOSAL IS TO SERVE CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS WHO ARE AGE FIFTY FIVE OR OLDER. THE BUDGET INCLUDES FORTY MILLION DOLLARS IN THE BUDGET YEAR FOR AUTOMATION OUT OF REACH AND STATE OPERATIONS IN PREPARATION FOR THIS EXPANSION. ANOTHER THING I WOULD HIGHLIGHT IS THE P. EBT PROGRAM OR PANDEMIC ELECTRONIC BENEFIT TRANSFER PBT IS A FEDERALLY FUNDED PROGRAM AS WELL IF MINISTERED BY CDFI IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. GROUP P. A. B. TEAM WE PROVIDE FOOD BENEFITS TO- CHILDREN WHO ARE UNABLE TO ATTEND SCHOOL OR CHILD CARE- IN PERSON BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC. THE PROGRAM HAS BEEN EXTENDED- THROUGH THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO SCHOOL YEAR SO PLANNING FOR THAT EXTENSION HAS JUST BEGUN AS WE ARE PLAYING SOME CATCH UP WITH THE ADMINISTRATION OF THESE BENEFITS THAT WE STOOD UP DURING THE PANDEMIC. SO CURRENTLY WE EXPECT TO ISSUE BENEFITS THOSE BENEFITS IN THE SUMMER OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND THE BUDGET DOES INCLUDE SOME- FUNDING IN THE BUDGET YEAR FOR TRANSACTION COSTS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED. FINALLY I WOULD EMPHASIZE BACK HEALTH FOOD. WHICH IS AT A FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR ONE TIME AUGMENTATION IN FUNDING TO PROVIDE FOR THE PURCHASE AND DISTRIBUTION OF ADDITIONAL FOOD. FOR THIS EMERGENCY FOOD ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. SO WITH THAT I WILL- LEAVE IT THERE FOR THE HIGH LEVEL SUMMARY AND FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF QUESTIONS IN THIS ITEM AND PASS IT TO OUR DEPUTY DIRECTOR OVER THE FAMILY ENGAGEMENT AND EMPOWERMENT DIVISION. JENNIFER HERNANDEZ. THANK YOU WELCOME BACK TO BE HERNANDEZ. GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU CHAIRMAN YOUR WOMAN- WE ARE WILL GO ON TO THE NEXT SERIES OF QUESIONS- THE FIRST QUESTION IS RELATED TO HOW WE REACH THE- SETTLED ON THE FIFTY MILLION AMOUNT PROPOSED FOR THE FOOD BANKS- SO CURRENTLY AT CDSS WE'RE PROVIDING TEN MILLION AND FOOD BOXES PER MONTH TO THE FOOD BANKS UTILIZING OUR COMPLETED NINETEEN FOOD BANKS SUPPORT FUNDING. AND THIS FUNDING IS OLD- REALLY GEARED AT ALLOWING OUR FOOD BANKS TO DISTRIBUTE AT THIS LEVEL OF TEN MILLION THROUGH JUNE OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO THIS ADDITIONAL FIFTY MILLION AS AN AUGMENTATION TO THE COP WOULD PROGRAM IS PROPOSED TO ALLOW EMERGENCY FOOD BOX PROGRAM TO END OUT WHILE PROVIDING FOOD BANKS WITH RESOURCES FOR THE SMOOTHER RAMP DOWN AS FEDERAL AND STATE EMERGENCY FOOD. ALLOCATION START TO TAPER OFF. NICOLE ABOUT THAT THROUGH ALTHOUGH ALL RIGHT. THE SECOND ITEM IS REALLY TO OUR PRIDE AND OUR SPENDING PLANS- FOR A LITTLE BIT OF CONTEXT FOR FEDERAL FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWO- WE CONSULTED WITH OUR COUNTY STAKEHOLDERS CLIENT ADVOCATES- ED TO INVEST THE FORTY THREE MILLION IN. THE FOLLOWING AREAS WE INVESTED AROUND RACE ACCORDING COLLUSION AND IMPLICIT BIAS TRAINING- TARGETED OUTREACH TO EXPAND CALFRESH INCLUDING STRATEGIES ON ENSURING THAT INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE ELIGIBLE CAN COME INTO OUR PROGRAM. THERE WAS ALSO AN INVESTMENT IN BENEFITS CALON CAL SAUCE- WITH SPECIFIC ENHANCEMENTS ENHANCEMENTS THAT ARE FOCUSED ON COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS- BEING ABLE TO SUPPORT AS- ALONG WITH APPLICATION THE SISTERS NEEDED IN ORDER TO MAXIMIZE. OUR CLIENTS SUPPORTIVE SERVICES WHICH WE KNOW IS THAT IS A CRITICAL NEED IN IN MANY COMMUNITIES- AND THEN LASTLY WE DID INVEST ADDITIONALLY AROUND EXPANDED ACCESS LANGUAGE ACCESS INCLUDING. ADDITIONAL LANGUAGES FOR ALL ONLINE AND PAPER FORMS- AND THEN LASTLY WE ALSO PRIORITIZE INVESTMENT AROUND IMPROVING EBT CARD SECURITY- SUCH AS THE CVV WHICH IS TYPICALLY WHAT YOU SEE ON CARDS THE NUMBER ON THE BACK. I'M IN TERMS OF OUR PLAN FOR FEDERAL FISCAL YEAR TWENTY THREE- WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF PLANNING FOR CONVENE OUR STAKEHOLDERS I LATER THIS SPRING WE WILL ALSO INCLUDE OBVIOUSLY THE CALIFORNIA WELFARE DIRECTORS. ASSOCIATION AND ITS MEMBERS ALONG WITH OTHER CLIENT ADVOCATES TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN COLLECTIVELY IDENTIFY PRIORITIES FOR OUR OUR BUT FUNDS AND SO THAT WILL HAPPEN LATER THIS SPRING AND WE CAN- REPORT AT A LATER DATE IN TERMS OF WHERE. WE LAND ON INVESTMENTS. THE NEXT ITEM IN REALLY TO A DEAN- CALFRESH- BUDGET METHOD- IN TERMS OF WHERE WE'RE AT IN THE PROCESS THE STATE IN COUNTIES- WILL NOT BE RESUMING ADMIN REBASE SCENE AT THIS TIME- A NEW METHODOLOGY. AND TOLE- WE'RE AT A PLACE IN THE PANDEMIC WHERE- WE HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE CAPACITY AND THINGS ARE STABILIZED IN TERMS OF- ELIGIBILITY IN THIS ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIVITIES. WITHIN THE OPERATIONS- THE CALIFORNIA ADMIN REBASE WILL RIGHT SIZE THE CALPERS COUNTY PROPHECIES THAT ARE IN PLACE- WHILE WE ALSO DEVELOP A MULTI YEAR PLAN TO BRING EFFICIENCIES TO THE PROGRAM. IN THE END THOSE ARE FIRST SERIES OF QUESTIONS IF YOU'D LIKE OUR- ANY QUESTIONS NOW. THANK YOU VERY MUCH DEPARTMENT FINANCE. THIS IS JIMMY DR WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE NO COMMENTS AT THIS TIME BUT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. LMAO NO COMMENTS AT THIS TIME THANK YOU OKAY. M. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I JUST WANT TO. THANK THE DEPARTMENT VERY MUCH ESPECIALLY FOR THE EBT ONLINE PURCHASING IT WAS SUDDENLY HEARD ABOUT A LOT IN THE DISTRICTS.

ESPECIALLY TO SHOP SAFELY FOR FOOD AT DURING THE PANDEMIC- DID WE SEE THAT TALK TO ME ABOUT THE CASELOAD NUMBERS. IN IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE CAL WORKS CASELOAD NUMBERS. SURE SO WE'RE ACTUALLY AT AN ALL TIME HIGH IN TERMS OF OUR CASELOAD FOR CALIFORNIA- WERE AT OVER TWO MILLION- HOUSEHOLDS AND OVER- FOUR THOUSAND FOUR MILLION INDIVIDUALS- IN TERMS OF WHAT WE'VE SEEN- COMPARED TO CAL WORKS. OBVIOUSLY THE INCREASES HAVE BEEN FAR GREATER- IN IN CALFRESH HOWEVER- THERE ARE HISTORIC SORT OF CHIPS THAT WE SEE TYPICALLY TOWARDS THE END OF THE YEAR. DECEMBER JANUARY ISSUE AND WE DID SEE THOSE MATERIALIZE HOWEVER- WE STARTED TO SEE A PIC IN APPLICATIONS IN JANUARY OF THIS YEAR. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND MAYBE THIS IS FOR A DIRECTOR JOHNSON HOW ARE WE DOING AND I KNOW IT'S THE NOTES ARE IN THE PROCESS BUT WORLD I WOULD HAVE ONE APPLICATION AND- GOING TO QUALIFY FOR EVERYTHING THAT YOU'RE QUALIFIED FOR. HOW IS THAT PROCESS COMING ALONG. YEAH WE ARE ABSOLUTELY. SURE WE ARE WORKING ON OUR HEALTH BENEFITS. AT EXTERNALITY WITHIN OUR COUNCIL COUNCIL SYSTEMS SO WE'RE GLAD TO PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.

DEDICATED RESOURCES TO START WITH ON CAL WORKS OUT REACH TO HOWARD THAT HEALTH PRESSURE OUT REACH CAL WORKS OUT REACH. OF THE TOTALITY OF THE ARRAY THAT CALIFORNIA HAS BUILT TO SUPPORT IN DESTRUCTIVE READY FOR ANY INDIVIDUAL EXPERIENCE AND HOW THOSE THINGS COME TOGETHER.

AND SO FUNDING FOR ANY NEW POLICIES THAT ARE NOT FULLY CAPTURED IN THE CASELOAD. TRENDED EXPENDITURE PROJECTIONS OF CENTER ARE ALL BUDGETED SEPARATELY IN THE CURRENT METHODOLOGY. SO- THIS IS SORT OF THAT THE INITIAL FRAMEWORK THAT WERE OPERATING UNDER. OKAY AND SELL OTHER WORDS AFTER TWENTY YEARS THIS FRIDAY AT GREATER AND GREATER DISCONNECT BETWEEN- WHAT'S. REALLY GOING ON AND HOW WE'RE FUNDING IT. HE HEARD MY COLLEAGUES SAID DR IF THEY WANT TO ADD ANY OTHER. I YES I JUST REYES MARNA FINANCE A I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THINGS THAT- SERVING THAT THE- THE REBATES FOR DISCUSSES THE LOOK AT GIVE AND- A COMPARISON OF HOW. OUR RESORT COSTS ARE RELATED TO THE PROGRAM BUT ALSO IN COMBAT AND COMPARING THAT TO ALL THE ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS OF THE LEGISLATURE IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF MADE OVER THE YEARS STOP STREAMLINED THE PROGRAM. AND THEN HOW FUNDING HAS BEEN PROVIDED FOR ALL OF THIS NEW PROGRAM SAYS APARTMENT AS- DIRECTOR- AS MENTIONED. AGAIN THERE IS A NEW PRO AND- IN CAIRO RECALL. OF THE DEPARTMENT FOR THIS PROGRAM- THERE'S ALWAYS FUNDING INCLUDED IN THE- THE BUDGET BY THE LEGISLATURE ADMINISTRATION PARTS SO. IT'S IN A SENSE ALMOST TO LOOK LIKE THAT. I GUESS IT SEEMS A LOCAL EVENT LIKE TO SING OBLIGATION ACCOUNT JUST CLICK ON THAT. WHAT THE COST WOULD BE BUT IT WAS JUST DELAYED DUE TO COPE AND OKAY ALL RIGHT NOW I APPRECIATE THAT I JUST I THINKIT'S IMPORTANT RETALIATES I KNOW THAT SOMETIMES WE- HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS OF A YEAR TO YEAR THING BUT- ALSO THESE THINGS THAT SOMETHING HAS GONE ON FOR DECADES. AND I THINK WE TOUCH ON SEVERAL THEM RAY EVEN JUST TODAY. SO I DO APPRECIATE THAT I HOPEFULLY- UNDERSTANDING COVE IT HAS THE LATEST BUT I THINK IT'S JUST IMPORTANT TO REMIND US- KEEP THAT IN MIND AND THAT WE DO NEED TO FIX THESE THINGS SO THAT THEY'RE- YOU KNOW. DATE THEY WORK WELL AND THAT IT'S FAIR FOR COUNTIES AND STATE AND SO FORTH AND MOST IMPORTANTLY OF COURSE THAT WE MOST EFFICIENTLY ARE ABLE TO DELIVER THE- YOU KNOW THE HELP TO OUR CONSTITUENTS CELL. DEATH OKAY THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MOVE ON TO A- NUMBER EIGHT STAYING WITH CALFRESH AND NUTRITION PROGRAMS IT STARTED AGAIN JENNIFER HERNANDEZ SO IN TERMS OF WHERE WE'RE AT WITH THE SEA FROM EXPANSION- WE KICK OFF OUR PROCESS LATE LAST YEAR IN OCTOBER- WHERE WE HAD. THE HOLDER LISTENING SESSION THERE ARE REGULARLY SCHEDULED QUARTERLY SEEK OUT STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS I'M ALREADY UNDER WAY WHERE THE FOCUS IS PRIMARILY ON IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES- AND THE THOUGHT RIGHT NOW WE GET IS THAT WE WILL BE RAMPING UP THAT EFFORT THAT ENGAGEMENT TO BUY MONTHLY. EVERY OTHER MONTH AS WE GET CLOSER TO ANTICIPATED IMPLEMENTATION DATE I IN TERMS OF THE AUTOMATION WE ARE MEETING ON A MONTHLY BASIS WITH- DEPARTMENTS ENTITIES THAT ARE ENGAGED IN THE PROCESS WITH CAL SIDES. AND CEDAR BDA JUST TO START PLANNING AND- ARRANGING WHAT THE REQUIREMENTS WILL BE- SO I DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE A FURTHER DETAILS ON THE SPECIFICS. BUT WE ARE IN IN THE STATE OF. THE NEXT ITEM. ISRAEL TO THE STATUS OF THE SIMPLIFIED APPLICATION FOR OLDER ADULTS AND INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES- BEING ARE CURRENTLY THE PROGRAM CALFRESH NUTRITION BRANCH HAS BEEN WORKING WITH OUR RESEARCH AUTOMATION AND DATA DIVISION HUMAN CENTERED DESIGN UNIT WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT. TO START TO- FACILITATING THE PLANNING PROCESS SO THAT WE CAN DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT- THE NEW APPLICATION SO WE'VE ALREADY HAD A SERIES OF INTERNAL MEETINGS- ACROSS THESE ARE TEAMS THAT ARE INVOLVED IN THE PROCESS. AND WITHIN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS WE WILL BEGIN BRINGING OUR EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDER PARTNERS TO OBTAIN THEIR INPUT ON THE SIMPLIFIED APPLICATION AND WE ARE ON TRACK TO. RELEASE. IN JULY OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE. THE THIRD ITEM IS RELATED TO THE SUPPLEMENTAL NUTRITION BENEFITS SMB AND TRANSITIONAL NUTRITION BENEFIT TNB PROGRAMS- IN TERMS OF. HOW MANY FAMILIES ARE ENROLLED ETCETERA AND SO- AT THIS TIME THERE IS NO DATA AVAILABLE TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE INVESTMENTS PROVIDED IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET HELP TO MITIGATE ATTRITION IN THE TNB PROGRAM HOWEVER WE ANTICIPATE RECEIVING UPDATED DATA WITHIN THE FOLLOWING WEEKS- AS A REMINDER I FOR EVERYONE HERE. THAT TNB RECERTIFICATION POTS WENT INTO EFFECT IN NOVEMBER OF TWENTY ONE AND SO WITHIN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS WE WILL BE APPY TO REPORT BACK WITH- UPDATED DATA. MOVING ON TO NUMBER FOUR- RELATED TO THE SS I SS P. EXPANSION. SO THE EXPANSION OF CALFRESH TO ACCESS SITE AND ASSESS THE RECIPIENTS WAS IMPLEMENTED IN JUNE OF TWENTY NINETEEN. AND SINCE THAT IMPLEMENTATION- BAND I'D GRADUAL INCREASES IN TOTAL SS I SS BE RECIPIENTS WITH THE MOST RECENT DECEMBER TWENTY TWENTY ONE MONTH TOLD LIVING TOTALING. ABOUT INDIVIDUAL RECIPIENTS RECEIVING CALFRESH SO THAT HAS BEEN MOVING ALONG. QUITE WELL. THE LAST ITEM- IN TERMS OF OUR- JUST THIS CATEGORY IS RELATED TO RECOMMENDATIONS- AROUND A STATE WIDE TELEPHONE BASED SERVICE MODEL. AND SO- PURSUANT TO SECTION SEVENTY. OF ASSEMBLY BILL ONE THIRTY FIVE I THE DEPARTMENT WAS CHARGED WITH- ENGAGING WITH COUNTIES WOULD ADVOCATES BEST I SEE ARE YOU AND THE STATEWIDE AUTOMATED WELFARE SYSTEM SIZE- TO UNDERGO A PROCESS WE WOULD FACILITATE AND IDENTIFY RECOMMENDATIONS- TO IMPLEMENT- FULLY TELEPHONE BASED SERVICE MODEL. AND SO THE RECOMMENDATIONS- THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED ARE AGAIN REFLECTIVE OF THE STAKEHOLDERS PURSUANT TO THE STATUTE- AND THE INDUSTRY ADMINISTRATION HAS NOT YET EVALUATED OR TAKING A POSITION ON THEM- HOWEVER I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE PROCESS THAT WE USED- IN IDENTIFYING- THESE RECOMMENDATIONS. SO AS MENTIONED CALFRESH ELIGIBILITY REPRESENTATIVES WERE ENGAGED THE COUNTY FOOD ADVOCATES AND OUR PARTNERS. S. C. A. YOU I'M COUNTIES WERE ABLE TO PROVIDE US WITH INFORMATION ON THEIR EXISTING TELEPHONE BASED PRACTICES- AND THEIR BUSINESS OPERATION PRACTICES INCLUDING CALL CENTER ACTIVITIES- WE ALSO COLLECTED FEEDBACK FROM THE SIZE. AND INCORPORATED THOSE SUGGESTIONS INTO OUR FINAL- RECOMMENDATIONS- THAT. WE ARE CURRENTLY EVALUATING. A THEN IN ADDITION TO THAT INFORMATION THERE WAS ALSO A- OUR PARTNER NOURISHED. WHO WAS A SPONSOR OF THIS SECTION OF THE BILL POSTED A LISTENING SESSION TO GATHER ADDITIONAL FEEDBACK FROM OTHER EXPERTS WITH EXPERIENCE IN TELEPHONE BASED SERVICE MODELS. AND SO- IN ADDITION TO THAT WE ALSO HIRED- COUNTY- AT WELFORD DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION AND THEIR MEMBERS- AND OTHER FOOD ADDICT ADVOCATES WHO PARTICIPATED AND IN THE PROCESS- SO THE END RESULT. AT THE MOMENT IS THAT THESE RECOMMENDATIONS- I SORT OF HAVE FOR HIGHER HIGHER TEAMS IF YOU WELL. CENTERED AROUND HOW TO. A TELEPHONIC- ACROSS THE STATE AND THOSE A RECORD AND TWENTY CALL CENTER. TO EXPLORE EXPANSIONS- INTERACTIVE VOICE RESPONSE OR OTHERWISE KNOWN AS I. VR'S AND TRANSFORM CREW MENTIONED HOW THE COUNTIES- I IDENTIFIED AS CALLERS IN OUTBOUND CALLS FOR INSTANCE- IF IT SACRAMENTO CALLING YOU THAT IT WOULDN'T SAY IT'S BLOCKED IT WOULD BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY SACRAMENTO COUNTY PER SE- SO THAT'S- A GREAT SUMMARY OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED- FOR CONSIDERATION- BY THE STATE. WHAT OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH BYE DEPARTMENT FINANCE. MR NEED DOCTOR WITH FINANCE NO COMMENTS AT THIS TIME BUT HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. ILIO. RYAN ANDERSON LEGISLATIVE ANALYST OFFICE JUST SOME CONTEXT AND- COMMENTS WITH REGARDS TO THE PROPOSED EXPANSION OF C. FAP- IN JUST TO START BY REMINDING US ALL HOW WE GOT HERE- THE C. FLAP IS A PROGRAM THAT CURRENTLY SERVES A VERY SMALL SLICE OF FOLKS WHO ARE INELIGIBLE FOR FEDERAL CALFRESH SHORT SNAP BENEFITS DUE SOLELY TO IMMIGRATION THIS IS ABOUT THIRTY SOME THOUSAND A LEGAL PERMANENT RESIDENTS WHO. UNDER EARLIER REGIMES FOR THE FOOD STAMPS PROGRAM WOULD HAVE BEEN ELIGIBLE BUT- AFTER THE WELFARE REFORM OF THE LATE NINETEEN NINETIES FOR NO LONGER ELIGIBLE OF COURSE THERE ARE MANY MORE. OF RESIDENTS OF CALIFORNIA HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS MORE THAT ARE INELIGIBLE FOR THESE BENEFITS ENTIRELY DUE TO THEIR IMMIGRATION STATUS AND THE LEGISLATURE STRODE- A LOT OF INTEREST IN EXPANDING BENEFITS TO THOSE FOLKS IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET THEY- THEY PUT IN SOME MONEY TO START OVERCOMING. SOME OF THE MANY AUTOMATION AND ADMINISTRATIVE CHALLENGES THAT YOU WOULD NEED TO OVERCOME TO SERVE THOSE POPULATIONS AND THEY SAID THAT- BENEFITS WOULD ROLL OUT USING AN AGE BASED APPROACH BUT THEY THEY DON'T REALLY SPECIFY. WHICH AGE RANGES WOULD BENEFIT FIRST NOW THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSALS TO START WITH- ALL THE IMMIGRANTS FROM PRIMARILY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT UNAUTHORIZED INDIVIDUALS- AGES FIFTY FIVE AND OLDER WHO WOULD OTHERWISE BE INCOME ELIGIBLE FOR THIS PROGRAM. IN AND THAT'S CERTAINLY CONSISTENT WITH THE LEGISLATURE'S INTENT BUT- WE DO JUST WANT TO REMIND YOU ALL THE NEAR YOU COULD CHOOSE TO TARGET OTHER POPULATIONS CERTAINLY- BASED ON OUR INITIAL ESTIMATES WHAT WE THINK THAT. THERE ARE OTHER AGE POPULATIONS YOUNGER- POPULATIONS THAT ARE MORE NUMEROUS IN THE STATE AND IT MAY ALSO BE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE A HIGHER PROPORTION WHO ARE INCOME ELIGIBLE FOR THIS PROGRAM SO A LOT OF CONSIDERATIONS THERE OF COURSE. IN THE MEANTIME- BUT IT MINISTRY AND- AUTOMATED MASON CHALLENGES ARE GOING TO BE THE SAME FOR ALL THE POPULATION SO. THAT DOLLARS ARE BEING SPENT IN THE BUDGET HERE ARE BEING PROPOSED FOR THE BUDGET YEAR WOULD BE APPLICABLE TO ALL THOSE RANGES. THAT'S ALL FOR NOW THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THEN BACK TO THE PARTY CAN YOU CAN YOU TALK ABOUT HOW YOU LANDED ON FIFTY FIVE AN OLDER AND AGAIN THAT THAT HAS ALSO BEEN A TARGET POPULATION WE'RE LOOKING AT. BUT AS WE JUST WERE TALKING ABOUT THAT MOVING YOU KNOW MOVING SOME FAMILIES WITH KIDS OUT OF POVERTY- HOW DO YOU PICK FIFTY FIVE AN OLDER HAS DIPPED POPULATION YOU'RE GOING TO START WITH FOR THIS PROGRAM. I CAN NOT A LITTLE BIT OF CONTEXT THERE SO- AS YOU MAY KNOW IN GENERAL THERE TEND TO BE FEWER SUPPORTS AN ALTERNATIVE. FOR OLDER ADULTS RIGHT- AND SO THAT THIS WOULD PROVIDE. ADDITIONAL SUPPORT FOR THAT PARTICULAR POPULATION- ALSO WE THINK ABOUT IDENTIFYING AND ADDRESSING HE NEEDS AND SUPPORTS FOR OLDER AND INDIVIDUALS. THAT ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE MASTER PLAN ON AGING- AND SO. YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S ANOTHER RATIONALE- BUT ALSO THERE ARE KEY GAPS IN SOCIAL SAFETY NETS FOR OUR FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS AND- THIS PART THIS PARTICULAR POPULATION IS- ALSO CONSISTENT WITH THE MEDICAL EXPANSION- MEDIC CAL EXPANSION TO ALL PERSONS REGARDLESS OF DOCUMENTATION STATUS SO- THERE THERE SEEM TO BE. A STRONG ALIGNMENT AND IN THOSE OTHER- PRIORITIES AS WELL. OKAY THANK YOU. CAN AND TELL ME AGAIN WHEN YOU'RE GOING TO WHEN YOU ADD ANTICIPATE GETTING UPDATES ON ON BOTH THE TMB IN THE S. AND B. PROGRAMS I KNOW JUST. START RECENTLY BUT WHEN YOU. EXPECT TO BE ABLE TO- SEE HOW THAT'S GOING. WE ARE A FEW WEEKS OUT- RECEIVING THAT DATA. OKAY THANK DR PEPPER. THANK YOU SO- SO BASICALLY JUST JUST TO BE CLEAR THE PROPOSAL START WITH- AT THAT FOR THE C. FLAP PROGRAM. FIVE MILLION THEN FORTY MILLION TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE FOR. RESIDENTS FIFTY FIVE AND OLDER- I APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR'S LEADERSHIP AND ACTUALLY CLOSING THE FINAL GAP HOPEFULLY. WE'LL PASS AT THIS YEAR I KNOW- WILL HAVE SOME DEBATE ABOUT HOW LONG IT TAKES TO REALLY IMPLEMENT IT BUT AT LEAST THAT IS A PROPOSAL ON THERE TO AT LEAST A FEW YEARS TRYING TO GET TO THAT PLACE. IS THERE IS THERE A PROPOSAL TO. SO IN THE OUT YEARS TO GO BEYOND THE FIFTY FIVE IT WHAT HOW MUCH WOULD IT COST TO. TO BRING THAT AGE DOWN ARE ACTUALLY JUST ELIMINATE THAT GAP ALTOGETHER. I'LL LET MY COLLEAGUE SENT OFF ON. YOUR. YEAH YOU GUESSED RESPONDFINANCE AND AT THE SAME THAT THE PROPOSAL JUST IS TO EXPAND BEYOND OUR EXPAND TO THOSE FIFTY FIVE AND OLDER I REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRATION STATUS- DURING JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EXTRA CONTEXT AND WHAT- DALY RESPONDED OR COMMENTED ON THAT- THERE WASN'T UNDER IS THERE THERE IS A DISCUSSION AGREEMENT THE FINAL BUDGET NEGOTIATIONS THE TWENTY ONE BUDGET ACTS. SIX SPEND THE PROGRAM BY IDENTIFYING WHICH POPULATION AND THEN POTENTIALLY SOME THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH IT WERE SOMETHING THAT WERE PROPOSED WE LOOKED AT THIS YEAR SO AGAIN TO REITERATE- DIRECTOR HERNANDEZ'S COMMENTS THAT- ADMINISTRATION EXIT AT LEAST FOR THE EXPANSION TO THE FIFTY FIVE PLUS IT MAKES MORE SENSE NOW. GIVEN THAT YOUR SUPPORT SIR ALTERNATIVES AS OLDER ADULTS FOR EXAMPLE- SOME USE MAY BE ELIGIBLE FOR SCHOOL BASED- MEALS- CAL WORKS PROGRAM ETCETERA BUT AT THIS TIME NO OTHER EXPANSION THE ON THIS- THE STATE'S POPULATION HAS THERE EVER HAS IT HAS ESTÁ BEEN BEEN MADE IF WE DECIDED. TO JUST FIND EVERYBODY HOW MUCH THAT WOULD COST. WE CAN WITH SOME THAT WE AT. WE HAD OUR- WHAT WE WOULD I GUESS A PROBLEM ONE WE WAS SHARED BY INDUSTRY WITH ALLEGE. DURING THE FINAL BUDGET NEGOTIATIONS LAST FISCAL YEAR- BUT WE HAVE ONCE BEEN REQUESTED AND WE'VE- COMMENTED THAT WE'RE WORKING ON ONE WE JUST WEREN'T ABLE TO GET ONE TOGETHER OTHER TIMES ARE QUESTIONING FOR THIS HEARING. OKAY SO MANY RECEIVED REQUEST LAST WEEK I JUST A FEW DAYS AGO. SO I THINK OF THE HELPFUL JUST AT LEAST ESTABLISH I GUESS WE CALL THE OTHER BROWN GREAT WHAT'S IF WE JUST WENT FOR EVERYBODY ELSE THE LAW OF SALES TO. NEGOTIATE GO BACK AND FORTH AS TO WHAT WE THINK WE CAN ACTUALLY DO- BUT I'D LIKE TO KNOW. THAT THEY'LL BE HELPFUL WE CAN GET THAT NUMBER- THE OTHER QUESTION I HAD IS- ACTUALLY AGAIN REALLY APPRECIATE THAT- WE'RE WILL CONTINUE TO GROW THE NUMBER OF- THAT TO. INCREASE ACCESS TO CALFRESH AND PEOPLE OF S. S. I. S. P. THAT WAS- THAT TOOK DECADES BEFORE WE- THAT HAVE- SO NOW THAT WE MADE IT HAPPEN SEVERAL YEARS AGO. DOES MENTION TO ACTIONS QUITE PRECISE WE HAVE SIX HUNDRED TWENTY THREE. THOUSAND FOUR TO FOURTY ONE PEOPLE. UNNECESSARY ASSIST YOU ON CALFRESH. DO WE KNOW IF YOU HAVE A ROUGH IDEA OF LIKE WHAT WAS AS A PERCENTAGE OF ALL THE PEOPLE WHO MIGHT BE ELIGIBLE I MEAN ARE WE- ARE. AT THE END IS THERE SOME SPEND NEARLY. ALL OF THAT IS THAT ALMOST EVERYBODY IS THAT HALF OF THE PEOPLE DO HAVE SOME IDEAS TO. SELL AGAIN FREESHEET IT'S INCREASING APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT'S BEEN PUT INTOIT JUST WANT TO GET A SENSE OF. OUR YOU KNOW HOW HOW. HOW HOW MUCH WE'RE PENETRATING THE MARKET CONSIDER THAT LIKE. OF PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY COULD BENEFIT FROM WHO ARE IN ESSENCE I ASSIST YOU BENEFIT FROM B. AND CALFRESH. SO I THINK WE'LL HAVE TO- GO BACK- COME BACK TO YOU AND PROVIDE YOU WITH THAT DATA I DON'T HAVE THAT OFFHAND. OKAY IF YOU COULD THAT BE GOOD SO AGAIN APPRECIATE THAT WE'RE INCREASING EVERY YEAR SO THAT'S THAT'S GREAT I JUST WANNA KNOW LIKE HOW MUCH FARTHER DO WE HAVE TO GO I KNOW THAT'S IT. I MEAN OVERALL FOR CALIFORNIA THE MET DID MENTION WE HAVE A RECORD NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN CALFRESH. BUT ACTUALLY CALIFORNIA IS A STATE HISTORICALLY HAS ACTUALLY. BEEN LOWER THAN ANY OTHER STATES IN TERMS OF THE PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE WHO PEOPLE. ALLEN TERMS OF PEOPLE WHO'D BE ELIGIBLE CALFRESH VERSUS WHO'S ACTUALLY AND ROLL. AND- OF COURSE WE'VE HAD MANY DISCUSSIONS AS TO THE REASONS WHY. AND SEEMS LIKE A SO MANY OTHER STATES HAVE DONE MUCH BETTER. BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO GET A SENSE OF. YOU KNOW WHAT CAN WE TRY TO DO AGAIN FOR PEOPLE QUALIFY CUTTER FOR CALFRESH- WHAT IS IT. THAT KEEPS THEM FROM BEING AND ROLLED AND- SO- ALWAYS AN UPDATE AS TO WHERE WE ARE AND- RELICT AND- I THINK- IT IS ALWAYS HELPFUL TO NOW. SO AND I'M CERTAINLY INTERESTED IN THIS PARTICULAR POPULATION BUT PERHAPS EVEN OVERALL- AND THEN FINALLY I GUESS AND- IN TERMS OF THE PHONE. SERVICE AGAIN FEATURED THE WORK THERE AGAIN THIS IS A- AN EFFORT TO REDUCE THE BARRIERS TO PEOPLE. SIGNED UP FOR COVERAGE WOULD QUALIFY- AND DOING THE STATE WIDE NETWORK. I GUESS ONE OF. THE QUESTIONS I HAVE IS THAT- NOWADAYS- USED TO BE WHEN PEOPLE OF THE LAND LINES THEY WOULD HAVE A- AREA CODE THAT'S TIED TO GEOGRAPHY. NOW PEOPLE GET A CELLPHONE AND THEY MIGHT HAVE MOVED INTO THE STATE TO MOVE FROM ONE PLACE. TO ANOTHER PART OF THE STATE IN THEIR AREA CODE IS SOMEWHERE ELSE. SO YOU ABLE IN TERMS OF BE SURE THAT YOU CAN. AND IN A STATEWIDE. SYSTEM TELEPHONE BASED SERVICE MODEL. AND YOU TALKED ABOUT HOW YOU DIRECT PEOPLE TO DIFFERENT LOCALITIES- ARE YOU. ARE YOU. HOW HOW'S THAT GOING HOW'S THAT WORKING WITH DO YOU YOU CAN OVERCOME THAT TECHNICAL PROBLEM WHERE. SOMEONE'S YOU KNOW IT CAN YOU ACTUALLY DEFY THE GEOGRAPHY IN WHICH THE PERSON'S ACTUALLY. LIVING JUST BASED ON WHERE. CALLING FROM TO BE SURE YOU. SIMPLY ARSENAL. ANYWAY TO THAN I AM CURIOUS ABOUT THAT- THAT ISSUE. YES SO WE THERE'S STILL A LOT THAT WOULD NEED TO HAPPEN IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THAT WE'VE ALSO HEARD FROM- EXISTING OPERATIONS ABOUT. AND THIS IS THIS ISSUE AND IT KIND OF FEDS INTO- SORT OF HOW THE APPROACH WOULD BE TAKEN SO I DON'T HAVE A SOLUTION PER SE- BUT IT IS ONE OF THOSE ISSUES THAT HAS BEEN BROUGHT UP IN THIS STAKEHOLDER PROCESS JUST BECAUSE- THAT FOLKS I'M TRAVELING WITHIN THE STATE- AND THE REALITY THAT THEY MAY HAVE A HOME A HOME CELL PHONE NUMBER THAT ISN'T REFLECTIVE OF WHERE THEY LIVE SO WE RECOGNIZE THE CHALLENGE NOT SURE YET IF WE CAN OVERCOME IT- ON THE TECHNOLOGY SIDE OKAY ALL RIGHT WELL I GUESS IT'S ON YOUR RADAR SCREEN JUST. THERE SORRY THANK YOU. AND THEN IF I MAY DOCTOR PENSA AD IN RESPONSE TO SOME OF YOUR OTHER COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS WE WERE ABLE TO- PHONE A FRIEND WHILE HIM WELL. DEPUTY DIRECTOR HERNANDEZ WAS SPEAKING AND TO FIND OUT THAT WITH RESPECT TO THE EFFORTS BY S. S. B. RECIPIENTS WE ARE ACTUALLY WE HAVE ACTUALLY MET OR EXCEEDED THE NUMBER. OF THE ALLEN INDIVIDUALS WE HAD ESTIMATED WERE ELIGIBLE- AND THEN I WOULD ALSO ADD AND WITH RESPECT TO YOUR COMMENTS ABOUT- IN THE PAST WITH OUR OUR REACH OF THE CALIBRATION PROGRAM THAT AND- IN TWENTY TEN- WE WERE ESTIMATING THAT WE HAD REACHED 50% OF ELIGIBLE CALIFORNIANS. AND THROUGH VERY TARGETED EFFORTS TO THEM AND QUITE A BIT OF WORK FROM THE LEGISLATURE AND THE ADMINISTRATION. TO IMPROVE THAT UPTAKE AND IN TWENTY NINETEEN WE WERE UP 270% SO THERE HAVE BEEN SOME VERY SIGNIFICANT GAINS IN. RECENT YEARS WITH RESPECT TO PROGRAM PARTICIPATION BUT OF COURSE WE SHARE YOUR INTEREST IN ENSURING THAT EVERYONE WHO IS ELIGIBLE. DOES INDEED TAKE UP THE PROGRAM SO THERE IS ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT IN THAT AND STILL TO COME. WELL. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SHARING THOSE METRICS. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. LET'S MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER NINE. HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS OVERVIEW. AND WE KNOW YOU DON'T HAVE ALL THE HOUSING HOMELESSNESS PROGRAMS IN THE STATE BUT YOU HAVE A BUNCH.

IS ALSO PROPOSED AND THE GOVERNOR'S TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE BUDGET. THE NEXT SECOND MOVED TO THE SECOND QUESTION I'M REQUESTING A STATUS ON ALLOCATIONS AND IMPLEMENTATION. SO SOON AFTER THE BUDGET WAS ENACTED ON JULY NINETEENTH THE HOUSING HOMELESSNESS RANCH AN OUNCE ALL CURRENT. PROGRAM GRANTEES WERE AUTHORIZED TO BEGIN UTILIZING THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE FUNDING APPROPRIATIONS AFFECTED BACK TO JULY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AND MEDIA WE FOLLOWING THE BUDGET ENACTMENT WE BEGAN DEVELOPING GUIDANCE RELATED TO STATUTORY CHANGES MADE BY AB ONE THIRTY FIVE AND THREE ROBUST STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT THE DEPARTMENT EVALUATED LESSONS LEARNED AND PROMISING PRACTICES WHICH WERE USED TO STRENGTHEN AND EXPAND. THE PROGRAM GUIDANCE THEN USED TO SUPPORT LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO PREPARE TO SCALE THE HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS PROGRAMS AND EFFECTIVELY UTILIZE THE TREMENDOUS FUNDING EXPANSIONS. THAT WERE MADE THIS BUDGET YEAR. C. IS ANNOUNCED TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE HOUSING SUPPORT PROGRAMS AND AN ADDITIONAL EIGHTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE BRINGING FAMILIES HOME PROGRAM FOR A TOTAL OF THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN FUNDING TO SUPPORT AND STABILIZE FAMILIES. EXPERIENCING OR AT RISK OF HOMELESSNESS. THESE FUNDS ARE EXPECTED TO SERVE NEARLY TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND FAMILIES FOR BOTH THAT HOUSING SUPPORT PROGRAM IN BRINGING FAMILY SOME PROGRAM OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS. IN ADDITION TO THE FAMILY PROGRAMS BY- AS A JUDGE JANUARY THIRTY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TWO CDSS IS MADE OVER NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS AVAILABLE TO LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO SERVE SENIORS.

IN ADDITION TO UPDATED PROGRAM GUIDANCE CDSS IS UTILIZED A PORTION OF THE FUNDS APPROPRIATED TO ESTABLISH A COMPREHENSIVE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE INITIATIVE WHICH WE LAUNCHED IN EARLY JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO. THE TA INITIATIVE IS DESIGNED TO SUPPORT THE EXPANSION AND GROWTH OF THE CDSS FUNDED HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS PROGRAMS STATEWIDE.

PROJECT WHEN HE SERVES BALL XP OMELESSNESS WHO ARE NINE HIGH ORYX HE OUT FOR DAYS STATE AN INDIVIDUAL WHO AT HIGH RISK A MEDIC CUMPLIR. SHOULD THEY CATCH THAT I OFTEN FOR LONGER STATE. PROJECT IS A LOW LET OF AND. AND DATE OF FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE HAVE SERVED PROJECT HE AND AS OF EARLY FOR. OVER EIGHT THOUSAND ARE BEING. THREE SITES ACROSS FORTY FIVE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY. THE KERN OCCUPANCY DATA CAN BE FOUND ON OUR DATA WHICH IS A THE- AND AT THE HEIGHT OF THE PRO AND AUGUST OF TWENTY TWENTY. SIXTEEN BALLOT FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY SEVEN ROOMS FOR SIX. THEIR PROJECT ROOM KEY AFTER STATE SIR. OUR STATE GOAL AND FIFTH THOUSAND RAM. AND MOVING ON TO OUTCOMES TODAY TEN THOUSAND HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN PARTICIPANTS AND EXITED TO PERMANENT HOUSING. 30% A PARTICIPANT HAVE AG TODAY. HOUSING ARE CONGER SHELTERS 8% AND DOES. ANTI PERCENT TO INSTITUTIONS OR OTHER DESTINATIONS. LOCALLY OPERATED PROGRAMS ACROSS THE STATE CONTINUE WORKING HARD TO HELP PARTICIPANTS MEET THEIR HOUSING GOALS.

IS CLOSE 260% COMPARED TO THE STATE AND NATIONAL AVERAGES WHICH IS A PART ARE APPROXIMATELY 37% AND I'LL STOP THERE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH A DEPARTMENT FINANCE. NINE MONTHS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE NOTHING FURTHER TO ADD AT THIS MOMENT- LMAO. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR GINNY BALLOT WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND YOUR AGENDA INDICATES AND AS WE'VE JUST DISCUSSED THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES RECEIVED SIGNIFICANT AUGMENTATIONS FOR THEIR HOMELESSNESS PROGRAMS IN THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET. ONLY OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS THE DEPARTMENT HAS EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT AND RAPID GROWTH IN THESE PROGRAMS. WE THINK YOUR FOCUS TODAY ON OVERSIGHT AND YOUR CONTINUED FOCUS ON OVERSIGHT REALLY MAKES A LOT OF SENSE IN THIS AREA. IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND HOW THESE PROGRAMS ARE WORKING THE OUTCOME THEY'RE PRODUCING AND WHETHER THEY'RE EXPERIENCING ANY CHALLENGES OR BARRIERS TO GETTING THE MONEY OUT THE DOOR OR GETTING THE PROGRAM UP AND RUNNING. SO THAT THOSE CHALLENGES CAN BE ADDRESSED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. AND CERTAINLY BEFORE ANY ADDITIONAL FUNDING AS AUTHORIZED. I WE ALSO JUST WANTED TO MENTION THAT OUR OFFICE RECENTLY PUBLISHED OUR INITIAL ANALYSIS OF THE GOVERNOR'S OVERALL PACKAGE OF HOMELESSNESS PROPOSAL. AND IT IS REALLY FAN AS YOU INDICATED EARLIER MULTIPLE DEPARTMENTS IN MULTIPLE PROGRAMS THROUGHOUT THE STATE BEYOND TO THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES PROGRAMS BUT- ONE OF THE TAKE AWAY FROM THAT ANALYSIS THAT IS MOST RELEVANT. FOR OUR HEARING TODAY IS REALLY THE FOCUS AND THE IMPORTANCE OF THE COORDINATION OF THE VARIOUS HOMELESSNESS PROGRAMS THAT EXIST THROUGHOUT THE STATE. MAKING SURE THAT THE IN THE STATE'S ENTIRE PORTFOLIO OF PROGRAMS WORKS TOGETHER EFFECTIVELY ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS AND REALLY UNDERSTANDING HOW THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES. PROGRAMS FUNDS INTO THAT OVERALL APPROACH- ON THAT NOTE THERE IS- AND IN YOUR AGENDA REQUEST- FOR SOME POSITIONS TO ASSIST WITH THE HOMELESSNESS. MANAGEMENT SYSTEM AND WE'VE REVIEWED THAT REQUEST AND WE HAVE NO CONCERNS AS WE SEE IT TO BE VERY HELPFUL IN FACILITY FACILITATING BOTH OVERSIGHT. AND COORDINATION THANK YOU. THE YOU VERY MUCH- AND I KNOW WE'RE PLAYING WE'RE PAYING CATCH UP WITH A HUGE HUGE HUMANITARIAN CRISIS WE SEE ON OUR STREETS AND I APPRECIATE THE WORK THE DEPARTMENT HAS DONE- AND THE URGENCY WITH WHICH IT IS DOING IT. CAN YOU CALL BACK AGAIN TO TURN. TO THE PROJECT ROOM KEYS ARE YOU SAYING. THAT WE HELPED ABOUT FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE AND THERE'S ONLY 18% OF THOSE. WHO HAVE KIND OF CIRCLE BACK TO THE STREETS. EVERYBODY ELSE NOW HAS A PLACE TO STAY OUT OF THAT. I'M I'M MIGHT DEDICATE THOSE NUMBERS RIGHT. YES SO I'M THAT PROJECT PEOPLE THIS STATE PROJECT GRANTEES FOR ABOUT SHORT STATE AND LONG TERM STAY. SO OVERALL OF ALL THAT- THE PERCENTAGE AND PEOPLE THAT HAVE. I PERCENT EXITED THE TEMPORARY HOUSING OUR CONGREGATIONAL CHURCH 18% AND NOW I'M IN TEN PERCENT. INSTITUTIONS ARE OTHER DESTINATIONS. OKAY AND OF THAT TEMPORARY HOUSING DO WE KNOW THEIR STATUS AT ALL. SO WE DON'T TRACK THAT STATUS AFTER THEY REPORT AND EXIT BUT THOSE STATUSES MAY BE TRACKED THROUGH THE LOCAL HOMELESS MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM. OKAY OKAY I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO KEEP LOOKING AT AND I MIGHT ASK THE L. A. O. BACK AGAIN AS WE'RE LOOKING AT THE COLLECTION OF ALL THIS DATA AND IN YOUR ANALYSIS WERE YOU ABLE TO TRACK THOSE THOSE POPULATION TO WHO TEMPORARILY TOOK OFF THE STREET BUT THEN WHERE WAS OUR FINAL DESTINATION THE FINAL STILL BREAK A YEAR OUT. BUT IS THERE ENOUGH COORDINATION AMONGST ALL THE DEPARTMENT WHO WHO HAVE THEIR HANDS ON THIS AND FROM THE LOCALS TO BE ABLE TO ACTUALLY TRACK THE EFFECTIVENESS OF GETTING PEOPLE OFF THE STREETS. PERMANENTLYYOU MADAM CHAIR GINNY PUBLIC IN WITH THE ANALYST'S OFFICE IT'S A GOOD QUESTION AND ONE THAT IS CERTAINLY ON OUR MINDS AS WELL- IT. NGUYEN VIET ARISTIDE BEGAN THE SIGNIFICANT AUGMENTATIONS TOWARDS HOMELESSNESS IN RECENT YEARS. OUR OFFICE DID RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT THE COORDINATION AND WHO IS SORT OF LEADING THE EFFORT- WE WILL SAY THAT FROM AN ADMINISTRATIVE PERSPECTIVE WE DO SEE THAT THERE'S BEEN SOME PROGRESS DEFINITELY ON THE DATA COLLECTION FRONT WITH THE- H. T. I. AFTER THAT HOMELESSNESS DATA INFORMATION SYSTEM AT THE LOCAL LEVEL BEING ABLE TO COLLECT. MORE INFORMATION THAN WE HAD BEFORE FROM THE CONTINUUM OF CARE SO WE ARE CONTINUING. IT'S NEW THOUGH I GUESS IS WHAT WE WOULD SAY IF THE WORST SORT OF STILL WAITING TO GET SOME OF THAT INFORMATION OUT- AND THEN THERE'S ALSO THAT CALIFORNIA INTERAGENCY COUNCIL ON HOMELESSNESS WHICH IS THE NEW. RENAMED REVAMPED ORDINATING BODY THAT REALLY FOR NEED TO CROSS THE STATE DEPARTMENTS AND ENTITIES AGAIN VERY NEW ALSO ALSO. LOOKING TO SEE HOW IT WORKS IN PRACTICE BUT SOMETHING. THAT WE REALLY SEE AS- FROM IT IN MINISTRY OF INFRASTRUCTURE CROCKER PARK ASSEMBLY TO BE PROGRESS. OKAY SO I GUESS- SO OVERALL I MEAN. THE RICHARD JOHNSON IF WE HAD TO SAY HOW ARE ALL THESE PROGRAMS WORKING IF YOU KNOW AS A PROFESSOR OF YOUR GRADING. HOW ARE WE DOING BECAUSE IF YOU IF YOU ASK THE PUBLIC WE'RE STILL NOT DOING VERY WELL AND I'M YOU'RE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR PUBLIC OPINION CERTAINLY- BUT AS WE'RE INVESTING MILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS INTO IT HOW I MEAN. DO YOU HAVE A MAGIC WAND TO TELL US HOW HOW THESE ARE DOING AND WHAT YOU'D LIKE TO SEE DIFFERENT. WHAT WOULD HELP. REALLY APPRECIATE THE QUESTION THAT SHARE IN THAT I DO WANT TO LIFT UP. WITH LA AND JUST MENTIONED IN TERMS OF OUR ABILITY COLLECTIVELY. TO AT TELL JUST THAT STORY AS TO THE DATA SYSTEMS AND REALLY BEING ABLE TO LOOK AT THE INDIVIDUAL THE PERSON. IN TERMS OF THEIR ABILITY TO MEET THEIR HOUSING GOALS AND BEING ABLE TO REPORT ON THAT HOLISTICALLY. AND NO MATTER IF THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES PROGRAM. ADD HOUSING COMMITTEE DEVELOPMENT ETCETERA SO. THAT THAT. IS A COMMITMENT I THINK OF ALL OF OURS REALLY APPRECIATE BOTH THE SECRETARY OF BUSINESS CONSUMER SERVICES HOUSING AND EXPECTED CHERRY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES. LEADING THAT EFFORT IN ENSURING THAT THE LEADERSHIP OF THE DEPARTMENT START THEIR PRESENCE- AND WORKING TOWARDS THOSE COMMON A WIND ADD GOALS TO BE ABLE TO BE ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE THAT OUTCOME. I WOULD SAY THAT. I JUST WANT TO LIFT UP THE TREMENDOUS WORK THAT'S HAPPENING LOCALLY HERE. I WHICH OBVIOUSLY MAKES ALL THE DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD IN TERMS OF THE INVESTMENTS I CERTAINLY WANT TO APPRECIATE OUR TEAM AND- AND- ONLY AT WORKING. REALLY DILIGENTLY TO GET OUT AT THE GUIDANCE AND WORKING WITH PARTNERS TO ENSURE THAT GUIDANCE- IS CONSISTENT WITH EVERYONE'S INTENTION AND WHAT WE THINK WORKS FAST. BUT ALSO THEN TO GET- STAFFING. RAMPED UP KIND OF ACROSS THE BOARD TO BE OUT. IN COMMUNITIES. IN SERVING POPULATIONS AND SUPPORTING THEM SO. I'VE CERTAINLY HAD THEIR WORK FORCE HERE- READ MORE IS NEEDED AS AS IN MANY OTHER PLACES YOU CAN SEE ABBOTT IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ADDITIONAL. RESOURCES COMMITTED TO ENSURE THAT THAT WORK FORCE IS AVAILABLE- AND WE'RE INVESTING THERE. IN TERMS OF THEIR ABILITY TO REACH OUT POPULATIONS BUT IT'S TAKING A MINUTE TO ENSURE WE HAVE THAT WORKFORCE NOT THE PLACE THAT. I WILL CONTINUE TO FOCUS. SENATE OVER ARCH THE ABI THIS ALL FITS WITH. A THE LARGE IN OUR- APARTMENTS. AT WAR AFFORDABLE. I IS TO MAKE A BIG. SO THAT. IF WE ARE WE'RE ON ONE. IS RIGHT AGAIN YOU HEARD FROM ACTING BRANCH CHIEF WOULD QUICKLY WAS THAT WE ARE. EXPANDING SOME OF OUR PROGRAMS NOT ONLY IN TERMS OF REACH ACROSS THE STATE BUT ALSO IN TERMS OF. ABILITY TO DO MORE ON THE PREVENTATIVE ENDS- AND THAT'S HUGE AND TREMENDOUS AND IT'S GOING TO REQUIRE- AGAIN DOES ACTUAL PORTABLE HOUSING. AT LOCATIONS TO BE AVAILABLE AND OPTIONS TO BE AVAILABLE TO FIX IT YEAH INDIVIDUALS IN NEED SO. AGAIN I THINK OUR OUR EFFORT IS MULTI PRONGED WE HAVE A COMMITMENT ACROSS LEADERSHIP ACROSS STATE GOVERNMENT'S WORK ON IT TOGETHER. AT TO BEABLE TO TELL THE STORY AND I THINK ALSO JUST AGAIN THE MORE WE CAN CONTINUE TO BOTH. ENSURE INVESTING IN THE POPULATIONS TODAY THAT NEED EXTRA NEED OUR SUPPORT. BUT ALSO LOOKING AT PREVENTATIVE. MEASURES SET TO GET IN FRONT ADDS. ADD THAT THE NEEDS GOING FORWARD. OKAY I KNOW PROGRAM LKE. LIKE THAT IT LIKE ALL THE COUNTIES ARE INVOLVED BUT HOW ABOUT SOME OF THESE OTHER BUT THE PROGRAMS LIKE PROP PROJECT ROOM KEY- HOME SAFE SOME OF THE OTHER ONES. ARE ALL THE COUNTIES EQUALLY- AT TAKING ADVANTAGE OF SOME OF THE OPPORTUNITIES. I'M NOT A VISITOR A LOT OF PROGRAMS AND SOMETIMES YOU HEAR FROM FOLKS ON THE GROUND THAT. THAT THERE COUNTY HASN'T BEEN ABLE TO APPLY OR PURPLE DOWN FUNDING OR- OR PERHAPS- NO WILLING TO SOME OF THE- TO RECEIVE HOLES THE STATE GET OUT. TURNOVER AT BRANCH CHIEF FOR TO GO OVER ONE TIME KIND OF THE PROGRAMS THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS ADMINISTERING HOW MANY COUNTIES ARE PARTICIPATING IN EACH SO YOU HAVE A SENSE OF BACK- YOU KNOW THE PROGRAMS THEMSELVES ARE ALSO IN DIFFERENT- EVOLUTION IN TERMS OF HOW LONG THEY'VE BEEN AROUND IN OUR ABILITY TO REFINE AND STRENGTHEN NEEDS TO GO FORWARD THAT HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT BUT- YOU ALSO HEARD. ACTING AT SHE'S MCCARTY SPEAK TO THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FFORTS THAT WE ARE KIND OF BRINGING ON ALL PARTIES TO HELP INSURE THAT WE HAVE OF BOTH THE TOOLS AND GUIDES AT THE STATE'S DEVELOPING AROUND. BLENDING AND BRAIDING THAT THE DIFFERENT RESOURCES THE FUNDING THAT STAND OUT BUT ALSO HAVE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE HELPING AT TRAINING THOSE CASE MANAGERS AND SUPPORT. THE ON THE GROUND COMMUNITY EFFORTS ACTION SURE THAT AGAIN OUR INDIVIDUALS ARE MEETING THEIR HOUSING GOALS FOR ALTERNATIVE ROUTES YOU ACTING CHIEF RECORDED TO SPEAK TO YOU. KIND OF THE. REACH OF OUR PROGRAMS BY PROGRAM. THINKING STRAIGHT JOHNSON YES WE ARE ON STATE. WE'RE NOT. 100% STATEWIDE BUT THERE'S A C. INCREASE. IN PARTICULAR AND THE HOME SAFE PROGRAM THAT THAT PROGRAM IS FIFTY EIGHT COUNTY HAS ACCEPTED THE NONCOMPETITIVE ALLOCATIONS THAT WERE MADE AVAILABLE EARLY AGE EARLIER THIS YEAR- WITH THE HOUSING AND DISABILITY ADVOCACY PROGRAM WE HAVE FIFTY SEVEN COUNTIES. AND TO TRIBAL ENTITIES WHICH ARE SERVING EIGHT TRY- WITH THE HOUSING SUPPORT PROGRAM WE HAVE FIFTY FIVE PARTICIPATING COUNTIES. AND WITH THE BRING FAMILY'S HOME PROGRAMS THAT ALLOCATIONS WERE RELEASED JUST EARLIER THIS WEEK WE CURRENTLY HAVE TWENTY TWO COUNTIES AND ONE TRY BUT WE ARE EXPECTING. A GREATER. PARTICIPATION THROUGHOUT THE STATE. OKAY AND YES THE NEXT STEP OF ACTUALLY HAVING HOUSING FOR PEOPLE TO MOVE INTO AFTER WE GET THEM STABILIZED IS A IS A IS A HUGE ISSUE AND CERTAINLY WE ALL HEAR ABOUT I AM TOLD WILL BE INTERESTED TO HEAR ABOUT THE NEXT BUT THE NEXT BRIDGE COMING UP ALSO. DR THANK YOU AND- APPRECIATE THE WORK BEING DONE BY THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES. AND TRYING TO PROVIDE HOUSING. I GUESS- THE FIRST QUESTION I GUESS I HAVE IS THAT- AND YOUR YOU HAVE TO BILLION OTHER TWELFTH THAT'S BE INVESTED- THERE ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN DIFFERENT PROGRAMS- I REALIZE EACH ONE HAS ITS OWN PERHAPS NICHE. BUT AND SOME OF THEM SEEM TO BE SOMEWHAT SIMILAR AND AGAIN MAYBE THAT'S DUE TO IGNORANCE- AND YOU CAN SPECIFY THE BUT- SO. DO WE KNOW TO WHAT DEGREE DO PEOPLE AND UP BEING SIR YOU KNOW SOME PEOPLE MAY BE SERVED BY MULTIPLE PROGRAMS OTHER. NOT AND AS YOU KNOW SOME OF THE PROGRAMS- AND ONLY IN SOME OF THE COUNTY SO FOR EXAMPLE. THE DOCTOR VIA CAL WORKS HOUSING SUPPORT PROGRAM WE WILL BRING FAMILY'S HOME PROGRAM ONES IN FIFTY FOUR COUNTIES AS WELL TWENTY TWO COUNTIES AND ONE TRIED. DESCRIPTION SEEMS SOMEWHAT SIMILAR SO. SO ANYWAY I'M JUST TRYING TO GET A SENSE OF HOW DO YOU. HOW TO BE SURE THAT THERE'S COORDINATION BETWEEN ALL THESE ARE THEY BEING CORNY AT THE STATE LEVELS ARE COORDINATION AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. IF YOU'RE PURCHASING THE MULTIPLE COUNTY SO- AND THEN I GUESS H. TAPPED THE HOUSING THIS BILL HAS THE PROGRAM MADE MENTION THAT THEY'RE ALSO INTEGRATING WITH PROJECT ROOM KEYS I GUESS THAT'S A POSITIVE MOVEMENT OR TRY TO LIKE FIGURE OUT HOW TO THE SCENE INTERFACE. HE SPEAK TO HOW. HOW RECORDING BETWEEN SETS EIGHTY SEVEN PROGRAMS THAT ARE JUST IN THE PARCEL SERVICES ALONE THERE'S OTHER PROGRAMS AND OTHER AGENCIES- SELL SELL. YOUR FARMS OKAY. OR EVEN WITHIN THE PARTY SOCIAL. BETWEEN THE SEVEN PROGRAMS AND EIGHT OTHERS THIS ENTERED THIS OTHER THERE'S ALSO THERE'S INTERAGENCY COUNCIL. BUT BASICALLY HOW TO BE SURE WE'RE OPTIMIZING OUR MAXIMIZING. WHO ARE DELIVERING YOU KNOW THE ACCESS TO THE SERVICES. YES SO- I WOULD SAY COORDINATION AT ALL LEVELS IS REALLY IMPORTANT SO AS THE STATE WE PRIDE WE- AIM TO PROVIDE COORDINATED GUIDANCE ACROSS ALL OF THE PROGRAMS TO ENSURE THAT. A LOCAL COMMUNITIES THAT ARE OPERATIONAL ISING IN IMPLEMENTING THE PROGRAM HAVE LOW BARRIERS TO PROVIDE DAY CRITICAL HOUSING SUPPORTS TWO DAY INDIVIDUALS AND THEY'RE SERVING. SO YOU'RE RIGHT THERE IS A LOT OF SIMILARITY ACROSS ALL OF THE PROGRAMS THEY'RE ALL VERY FLEXIBLE- IN INTENDED TO BE HOUSING FIRST LOW BARRIER AND PROVIDE- HOUSING SUPPORTS TO PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS FOR AT RISK OF HOMELESSNESS. AND THEN THE PART WHERE IT DIFFERS A LITTLE BIT IS JUST BASED ON THAT THE SOCIAL SERVICE PROGRAM AT THE INDIVIDUAL MAYBE SERVICE THROUGH A LOCALLY SO. FOR EXAMPLE AND THE HOUSING SUPPORT PROGRAM FOR A FAMILY THAT'S RECEIVING HOW WORKS IF THERE'S A HOUSING NEEDS. THAT THAT COW WORKS CASE WORKER IS ABLE TO IMMEDIATELY PROVIDE HOUSING RESOURCE TO THAT PERCENTAGE THERE'S NOT A REQUIREMENT THAT THE- YOU KNOW GO THROUGH DIFFERENT DOORS OR- FOLLOW DIFFERENT PASSED IN ORDER TAKE. AND ACCESS TO HOUSING SUPPORTS SO- COORDINATION AT THE STATE LEVEL WITH OUR GUIDANCE COORDINATION AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND JUST MAKING SURE THAT NINETEEN EIGHTIES ARE LOOKING AT HOW THEY'RE ADDRESSING HOMELESSNESS. ACROSS THE BOARD IN A CLASSIC COMMUNITY AND WE'VE- AND PARTICIPATED IN. THAT STRATEGIC FUNDING GUIDE THAT WAS SPREAD OUT THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA INTERAGENCY COUNCIL ON HOMELESSNESS WITH HOW COMMUNITIES CAN LOOK AT THE DIFFERENT OPTIONS OF FUNDING AVAILABLE IN THEIR COMMUNITY TO SERVE THE DIFFERENT POPULATIONS IN NEED. BUT ESSENTIALLY WE AIM FOR THERE TO BE NO WRONG DOOR THAT ANY FAMILY OR INDIVIDUAL THAT SERVES THERE IS SOCIAL- SERVICE PROGRAM HAS. ACCESS TO HOUSING SUPPORT. I SO I GUESS THE THAT IS I'M GONNA BRING UP THIS IS THAT I. P. AND RONGO APPROACH IS THAT. IT SAYS DIFFERENT PROGRAM- AND THERE BE SIMILARITIES- WHETHER- PEOPLE ARE HAVING THIS SPEND TIME FIGURING OUT OKAY DO CLASS OR THIS ONE OR THAT ONE AND OR SO FORTH SO TO THINK ABOUT IS THERE A WAY TO SIMPLIFY IT SO DON'T HAVE SO MANY DIFFERENT PROGRAMS WHICH NOW WE'RE GOING OKAY WHEN A CHECK FOR THIS PROGRAM WILL TAKE THAT PROGRAM CHECK THAT PROGRAM. AND YES THERE'S NO WRONG DOOR BUT BUT THERE THERE'S LIKE OKAY WELL CAN WE SIMPLIFY THE OVERHEAD AND ADMINISTRATION OF MULTIPLE PROGRAMS AND DECREASE THE NUMBER OF PROGRAMS I GUESS ARE ARE DECREASE THE BARRIERS YOU KNOW HOW TO ADMINISTER AND FORTH. AND- SOMETIMES YOU KNOW WE DO HAVE MULTIPLE ROMANCE BECAUSE MULTIPLE FUNDING STREAMS AND IF IT'S A FEDERAL FUNDING STREAM THEM IF CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS ONE FUNNY SCENE VERSUS THE OTHER BUT I NOT SURE THAT'S NECESSARILY. TRUE IN THIS CASE ALTHOUGH I COULD BE WRONG. HEY JULIE YEAH. ONE POINT I WAS JUST GOING TO MAKE THAT- WE SAID ASSISTANCE NOW WE THIS CIGNA INCREASE IN THE FUNDING WE ARE LOOKING- IN PARTICULAR ABOUT THE PROJECTS FOR THE PRO TO. AND TO WIN THAT STREAMLINED AND THE MOST EFFECTIVE USE OF THE FUNDS SO THERE'S NOT ISN'T THIS PROGRAM OR THAT PROGRAM OKAY I'M ANSWER I WOULD JUST ADD THAT THESE ARE POPULATION SPECIFIC SO YOU KNOW HOME SAFE IS SUPPORTING THE INDIVIDUAL THAT'S BEEN ENGAGED IN THE ADULT PROTECTIVE SERVICES SYSTEM CAL WORKS HM HOUSING SUPPORT PROGRAM IS BECAU WORKS RECENTLY THE FAMILY THEY ARE DIFFERENT POPULATION FOCUSED. PROGRAMS AT THIS POINT BUT TO YOUR POINT THERE'S ALWAYS OPPORTUNITIES NO MATTER IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OUR PROGRAMS OTHERS AGAIN THAT WERE PARTNERED WITH TO ADD BRIDGE SHE'S MCCARTY MENTIONED TO BE FINANCING GUY WE'RE TRYING TO LAY OUT- THAT ROAD MAP IN THOSE OPPORTUNITIES LOCALLY SO THAT THAT THE COUNTIES HAVE AVAILABILITY AFTER THROUGH THAT TARGETED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND THIS I RESOURCE TO BE ABLE TO ENSURE THAT. INDIVIDUALS ARE CONNECTED WITH THE APPROPRIATE PROGRAM BATCH I ALWAYS A WORTHWHILE GOAL IN IN SOMETHING THAT WILL CONTINUE TO EXPLORE OKAY YES SIMPLIFICATION IS THAT AND TRYING TO FIND PUT THINGS TOGETHER AFTER ALL IF YOU END UP FIND YOURSELF HAVING TO TRAIN PEOPLE EXTENSIVELY TO NAVIGATE ALL THE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS WELL THAT MAY BE OF SOME BENEFIT MAYBE WE'VE MADE THE- ROAD MAP TO COMPLICATED FOR PEOPLE IF WE IF PEOPLE NEED TO HAVE BE TRAINED UP TO FIGURE OUT WHICH PROGRAM. PEOPLE FIT INTO HM GPS HAS ROAD MAP OUT EXACTLY- THE OTHER THE OTHER THING IS I DO APPRECIATE SO WE HAVE A YOU KNOW I GUESS 300-520-0042 POSITIONS TO HELP PEOPLE WITH THE HOMELESS MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM I GUESS MY QUESTION IS GIVEN. THE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS AND SO FORTH IS THAT ENOUGH THAT I MEAN- IS TO BE T. PEOPLE'S GOING TO IT SO WE TALKED A BIT ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF DATA AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT YOU KNOW WHAT OUR RESULTS ARE- IT'S MY CHECKED. ESTIMATE THAT THE SMALLER I M. IN OUR USUAL BUT THINGS. AND IF THAT'S ENOUGH THAT ENOUGH- BUT I DID WANT TO RAISE THAT GIVEN HOW MUCH. OF THE RESOURCES ARE PUT INTO A- THE DRESSING THE ISSUE. EVERY THAT QUESTION VERY MUCH SENATOR- I DO THE T. HAS- BIG STAFFING READ THAT WE HAVE A WHOLE LIST LOOKING AT DATA THE THIS IS. ABOUT THIS THAT THERE OF WHAT WE CHARACTER STILL THE IN TERMS OF THE EXPERT OF THESE PROGRAMS AND ARE AT OUR INTERACTION WITH THE STATE ASSISTANT VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE QUESTION SO I'M JUST GONNA SAY IS DON'T TELL ME YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH PEOPLE. DON'T TELL ME THAT A COUPLE YEARS LATER YOU WON'T TELL CENTER EGGMAN THEY DON'T HAVE THE PEOPLE TOGETHER TODAY THAT SHE NEEDED BECAUSE YOU ONLY ASK FOR TWO PEOPLE TODAY SO JUST JUST RAISING THAT- OKAY. NO I APPRECIATE THE THAT I'M SURE THERE'S MORE THAT WE CAN GET INTO- BUT- YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF GOOD WORK BEING DONE- WE UP BY LKE ONE JUST LAST THING A PROJECT ROOM KEY- I UNDERSTAND AND- OUR ANALYSIS THAT WE EXPECT THAT- FEMA'S GOING TO FUNDED THROUGH AT LEAST APRIL FIRST TWENTY TWENTY SECOND AS OUR ANTICIPATION ALTHOUGH I KNOW YOU CAN'T PREDICT THE FUTURE. THAT'S GOING TO GO BEYOND THAT OR- BESKOW. WE HAVE CERTAINLY THIS IS OBVIOUSLY BEEN THAT A TREMENDOUS PARTNERSHIP WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT NEEDS RESOURCES THAT I'VE MADE AT OUR OFFENSE THAT LEVERAGES DIDN'T EVEN FURTHER AND SO THERE IS A COMMITMENT THAT THEY HAVE TO ALWAYS GIVE US AT LEAST A THIRTY DAY NOTICE OF TURNING THE PROGRAM OFF WE WE'RE THRILLED THAT WE WERE GETTING KIND OF THE MONTH TO MONTH APPROVALS THAT SHIFTED AT SAID MANY MONTHS ADMIN THIS LAST APPROVAL SO I CERTAINLY ENGAGED AND ADDS TALKING WITH THEM FREQUENTLY AROUND- THE POTENTIAL FOR EXTRA SURE THAT OUR BEST. YOUR SUPPORTING THE READ- STRATEGY AND SEARCH THAT'S OUR AS WE ARE SEEING SOME OUR PROGRAM- BAG IS AT AT AND USE THE KIND TO PASS THAT THEY'VE HAD A TO DATE OF COURSE WE ALSO HAVE THE TREMENDOUS SUCCESS OF THE HOME KEY TRANSITION STORY ACTUALLY BEEN ABLE. TO ACQUIRE SOME OF THESE PROPERTIES BUT CERTAINLY WE ARE IN TOUCH WITH THE MAC FREQUENTLY AND WILL GIVE YOU THAT UPDATE AND HOPEFULLY GOOD NEWS THE CENTERS WE RECEIVE IT OKAY ALL RIGHT WELL CERTAINLY I GUESS WE JUST HAVE TO AND RECOGNIZING OF THOROUGHLY PROVIDING US IN DEPRECIATED PRICE AT LEAST SEVERAL MONTHS THAT WE'RE ALWAYS GONNA HAVE TO FIGURE OUT- POSITION. TO POSITION OURSELVES FOR. A YOU KNOW PLAN B. F. SOME REASON THEY SOMEBODY TELL US WHAT THE MONEY'S GONNA START DRYING OUT- THAT- GIVEN THAT THE SIZE OF THE PROGRAM THAT- WE'RE NOT CAUGHT FLAT FOOTED SO- AGAIN HOPEFULLY THE GOVERNMENT. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL SEE THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS PROGRAM THE NEED TO CONTINUE TO FUND IT AND- I CERTAINLY HOPE MY CONGRESSIONAL REPRESENTS A HEARING YOU SAY THAT RIGHT NOW- BUT ALSO JUST. YOU KNOW BE SURE WE ALSO ARE READY THAT WE DON'T LEAVE PEOPLE STRANDED WHICH I KNOW YOU WANT TO SELL. THANK YOU NUMBER TEN. COMMUNITY CARE. EXPANSION C. C. E. PROGRAM. OKAY SO AGAIN ENGINE THAT PROVIDES AN OVERVIEW AND I'M THE COMMUNITY CARE EXPANSION PROGRAM. ON M. P. H. TWENTY SIX AND- IT'S EXCITING TO TALK ABOUT AND THAT BUILDING HAVE HOUSING OPTIONS SO AS INDICATED THERE'S FIVE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS MADE AVAILABLE VIA THEIR REQUEST FOR APPLICATIONS ON JANUARY THIRTY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TWO FOR THIS YOU SEE CAPITAL EXPANSION PROJECT. ON AN INFORMATIONAL WEBINAR WALKING THROUGH THE REQUEST FOR APPLICATIONS WAS PRESENTED ON FEBRUARY TENTH AND INCLUDED OVER FIFTEEN HUNDRED WEBINAR PARTICIPANTS FOLLOWING THE WEAPON ARE WE'VE HAD A HUNDRED AND FORTY SEVEN PRE APPLICATION CONSULTATION REQUESTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE THAT NUMBER'S BEEN GROWING BY THE DAY SO- IT'S PROBABLY EVEN HIGHER THAN THAT THEY COUNT THAT I GOT LAST NIGHT. THESE PROSPECTIVE APPLICANTS ARE CURRENTLY WORKING WITH IMPLEMENTATION SPECIALIST SPECIALISTS TO DEVELOP THEIR- COMMUNITY CARE EXTENSION APPLICATION AND WE'RE MONITORING THE APPLICATION CONSULTATIONS VERY CLOSELY TO UNDERSTAND WHICH TYPES OF PROJECTS WILL BE SUBMITTED ANY ASSESSMENT OF NEED FOR THE RESIDENTIAL CARE SETTINGS COMMITTEE SUBMITTED BY EACH OF THE APPLICATIONS. ON THE NUMBER OF NEW BADGER UNITS THAT WILL BE ESTABLISHED THROUGH THE COMMUNITY CARE EXPANSION WILL ULTIMATELY DEPEND ON THE TYPE OF FACILITIES AND PROJECTS THAT ARE APPROVED AND FUNDED WITH EARLY ESTIMATES WE PROJECTED AT APPROXIMATELY FOUR THOUSAND BEDS CREATED AND ABOUT THREE THOUSAND ADS TO BE PRESERVED AGAIN THOSE ARE EARLY ESTIMATES- AND MOVING ON TO THAT SECOND QUESTION IN RELATION TO THE ESTIMATED. NEED FOR THE PRESERVATION. I'M SPECIFIC. CAPITAL ON SUBSIDY RAZOR. SO THEY CAN CARE. WAS ESTABLISHED A RECOGNITION THAT THE STATE NEEDS A BROADER PORTFOLIO OF HOUSING TO END HOMELESSNESS WHICH CAN BE ACHIEVED THROUGH CONTINUED ACQUISITIONS AND CREATION OF NEW UNITS. SO THIS IS C. C. E. INCLUDES A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT OF FIFTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS SPECIFICALLY TO PROVIDE. OPERATING SUBSIDY PAYMENTS IN ORDER TO PRESERVE BADS FOR SSI RECIPIENTS AND LICENSED ADULT AND SENIOR CARE FACILITIES. AND THRILLED COMMUNITY CARE LICENSING SURVEY DATA WE ESTIMATE THAT THERE ARE ABOUT FOURTEEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED INDIVIDUALS CURRENTLY RECEIVING SSI AN EXISTING LICENSE ADULT AND SENIOR CARE FACILITIES. SO IF WE USE AN ESTIMATE OF APPROXIMATELY ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER AND NEED FOR EACH CURRENT SSI RECIPIENTS IN LICENSE FACILITIES. THAT WOULD PROVIDE OPERATING SUBSIDY PAYMENTS FOR JUST ABOUT FOUR MONTHS IF WE LOOKED AT. THE FUNDING DISTRIBUTED STATEWIDE. AND IN PARTNERSHIP COUNTY STRIVE AND THIS R- ARE DEPARTMENT WILL CAN TO. THE NEEDS OF THE PROGRAM A IMPLEMENTS THEIR THIS. AND FINALLY THE LAST QUESTION- ASKING HOW THE DEPARTMENT ENVISIONS THE PRESERVATION FUNDS WILL BE ALLOCATED WE ARE STILL IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING THE ALLOCATION METHODOLOGY BUT WE ARE ANTICIPATING TO USE. THAT ESTIMATES OF THAT CURRENT- SSI RECIPIENTS IN LICENSED AT. LICENSE FACILITIES AS I MENTIONED THERE'S FOURTEEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED SO WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING AT USING THAT ESTIMATE AND THE PROPORTION OF INDIVIDUALS IN THOSE BAGS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND I WILL STOP THEIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH A DIFFERENT FINANCING THING TO ADD NOTHING AT THIS MOMENT LMAO. ANGELA SHORT WITH THE L. A. O. JUST A SOMEWHAT ECHO MY L. A. O. COLLEAGUES COMMENTS FROM THE PREVIOUS AGENDA ITEM- WE WOULD JUST NOTE THAT CCP DOES REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT- AUGMENTATION FOR A NEW PROGRAM- FOR DEEP A CDS US FOR HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS- AND AS THE PROGRAM MOVES INTO DE UM APPLE APPLICATION AND ALLOCATION FACES WE- THINK THAT THE LEGISLATURE'S APPROACH ON OVERSIGHT MAKES SENSE- AND ALSO WOULD STRESS THE IMPORTANCE OF ONCE AGAIN UNDERSTANDING THAT COORDINATION PIECE. AND HOW THIS PROGRAM- FITS INTO THE STATE'S OVERALL STRATEGY TO ADDRESS HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I THINK- I MEAN IT WE OUGHT WE ALL SEE THAT THE PERFECT SENSE- THIS BUDGET PROPOSAL MAKES AT THAT. WE HAVE ALL THE STUFF UP FRONT WE HAVE A HUGE NEED FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING BUT WE NEED THAT BRIDGE IN PLACE. TO KEEP PEOPLE IN SOMEPLACE. AS WE CONTINUE TO BUILD OUT. CAN I ASK HOW HOW DID YOU COME UP WITH THAT AMOUNT. I MEAN IS IT BASED ON THE- ANALYSIS OF THE NEED OF THE AMOUNT OF BEDS. OR DID YOU JUST DOUBLE WHAT WHAT THE FEDS ARE PAYING OR HOW DO WE COME UP WITH A EIGHT HUNDRED AND FIVE. MILLION GENERAL FUND FOR THREE YEARS. I'M CENTER EGGMAN DESIGNS- NINE GOT IT WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SAID THE EIGHT HUNDRED AND FIVE MILLION WAS INCLUDED IN THAT TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET ACT- BOTH ON DISCUSSIONS ON WHAT WAS AVAILABLE OF A GENERAL FUND AND THEN THAT. ARE H. C. B. S. AND IN THE STATE THIS GOAL RECOVERY. OKAY AND WE AND WE FEEL LIKE THAT THAT IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO FOUR THOUSAND BEDS. OR PROJECTING. EARLY ESTIMATES AT THIS TIME FOR THE EXPANSION COMPONENT OF THE PROGRAM ESTIMATE FOUR THOUSAND ADS. AND THEN THREE THOUSAND BEDS FO THAT PRESERVATION THE PROGRAM COMPONENT OF THE PROGRAM. OKAY AND SO THE DATA AND AGAIN THAT JUST WENT OUT SO YOU'RE THE APPLICATIONS ARE ARE COMING IN. AND DO YOU FEEL LIKE WE HAVE ENOUGH STAFF TO BE ABLE TO TURN THOSE AROUND TO BE ABLE TO START GETTING THAT MONEY OUT THE DOOR IN TIME FOR THE FEDERAL FUNDS. TO BE OUT. SO WE ARE WORKING WITH A THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATOR FISCAL INTERMEDIARY- TO HELP US ENSURE THAT. THE PROGRAM IS STOOD UP AND IMPLEMENTED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE UNDERSTANDING THE URGENT NEED. FOR IT BUT THAT'S TO BE CREATED AND PRESERVED SO WE ARE AND- WE DESIGNED A PROGRAM THAT CONSISTENT WITH THE SPENDING TIME LINES THAT. HAVE BEEN THAT ARE IN PLACE WITH THE FEDERAL FUNDS BEING USED. WE'RE ALSO ALSO SEE WE'RE PROVIDING A SIGNIFICANT LEVEL OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO HELP APPLICANTS UNDERSTAND THAT DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT AND CONSTRUCTION PROCESS. OF THESE FACILITIES AND SETTINGS TO ENSURE THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO. AGGRESSIVE TIMELINES. OKAY AND WHEN YOU SEE THE- THE CERTAIN AMOUNT FOR THE OPERATING AND THAT THAT IS JUST. HE DID SO THAT'S NOT FOR THE PRESERVATION AS FOR THE OPERATION OF THE FACILITIES SO AS I JUST MCNALL ADJOURNMENT THAT OUR CURRENT LEVEL OF REIMBURSEMENT FOR A BED. IS INADEQUATE FOR THE LEVEL OF NEED. OF EACH INDIVIDUAL IN THE BED HAS GONE UP. SO THE QUESTION IN THE AGENDA RELATING TO THE FIFTY FIVE MILLION FOR THE OPERATING SUBSIDY PAYMENTS IS IN RELATION TO- PROVIDING HE MAN. FOR EXISTING- FACILITIES SERVING AND SSI RECIPIENTS SO WHO KNOWS AND TYPES OF PAYMENTS WOULD BE USED TO COVER OPERATIONAL DEFICIT SO IT COULD BE- THINGS TO DO WITH JUST OPERATING A FACILITY NOT RELATED TO THE SERVICES. THAT ARE PROVIDED TO INDIVIDUALS IN THE FACILITIES SO THAT UTILITY BILLS FOR- ADMINISTRATION AND THOSE TYPES AND- ACOSTA COVERAGE TO THE OPERATING PAYMENT. THE INSURANCE ADD AS CERTAINLY WE BEEN FOCUSED ON ENSURING THAT WE ARE AT RETAINING THE ADULT SENIOR CARE SETTINGS ACROSS CALIFORNIA WHILE WE SEE WHEN WE SEE PROGRAMS CLOSE RIGHT THEY INDICATE DIRECT COMMUNICATOR LICENSING DIVISION THAT THEY'RE- PLANNING TO GO ON TO BE AN ACTIVE STATUS ARE CLOSE WE'VE BEEN SERVING THOSE PROGRAMS- AND SO AT THE COST OF OPERATING WAS ONE AND THEN CERTAINLY THAT KIND OF LARGEST RESPONSE. ON THOSE SURVEYS THAT WE SAW ESPECIALLY AS IT RELATES AGAIN TO SETTINGS THAT WERE SUPPORTING SSI RECIPIENTS SO THAT'S KIND OF HOW WE'RE GETTING TO- THIS OPERATING SUBSIDIARIES RESERVE COMPONENT AT THIS PROGRAM AND WILL CERTAINLY BE STUDYING. IT'S IMPACTS ON THE ABILITY OF PROGRAMS TO USE THATREMAIN OPEN THEY NEED THEIR COSTS RIGHT BECAUSE ONCE THAT SUBSIDY GOES AWAY WE'RE STILL GOING TO HAVE THAT. THAT GAP THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO FILL SOME KIND OF WAY FOR. AN END CAN YOU WIND WHEN YOU'RE SERVING THE- THE FACILITIES THAT ARE THAT ARE THINKING ABOUT CLOSING. IS IT BECAUSE OF THE COST OF REAL ESTATE OR IS IT BECAUSE THE COST OF PROVIDING CARE IN THE AND THE COMPLICATIONS. OF FUNDING. YEAH WE IT'S A BIT HABIT WORK REFINING OUR SURVEY TO OVER TIME IT'S BEEN A BIT OF THAT A MORE OPEN ENDED. QUESTIONS SO IT'S BEEN MOSTLY AND MORE GENERICALLY RESPONDED TO BUT WE CAN CERTAINLY LOOK AT. HOW WE'RE ASKING THAT QUESTION IN OUR ABILITY TO GET A LITTLE MORE SPECIFIC TO YOUR QUESTION- IS THAT WE DO EXACTLY WHAT HAS BEEN WAS THE DRIVER AROUND ANY COSTS AT A CHALLENGES THAT THEY'RE FACING SO GLAD TO MAKE SURE THAT'S- A PART OF OUR OUR QUESTIONS GOING FORWARD. THAT WOULD BE GREAT BECAUSE THAT'S SOMETHING WE HEAR REPEATEDLY THAT THESE THAT THE STEP DOWNS ARE OR CLOSING THAT'S HARD TO FIND- AND IF WE CAN'T SOLVE THAT THEN. THEN THAT'S A HUGE CHUNK MISSED OUT OF OUR OUR SYSTEM. AND WILL IMPACT EVERYTHING ELSE SO I THINK IF WE COULD FIND OUT EXACTLY SOME OF THE DIRECT REASONS- AND SEE WHAT WE CAN DO ABOUT. FOR THOSE HOLES OR- DOING SOMETHING ABOUT GAPS. I THINK TO KEEP THOSE THOSE. NOT ONLY TO GROW THE NUMBER WHO ARE OFFERING THE SERVICES BUT TO MAINTAIN THE ONES. THAT WE HAVE WHICH- IS WOULD BE REALLY VALUABLE DATA AND I'D APPRECIATE IT. IF WE COULD FOCUS ON THAT. DOCUMENT I THANK YOU AND I JUST ALSO WANT TO REITERATE WHAT- CARE EGGMAN MENTIONED I THINK FOR BOTH OF THESE. NOW FOR THIS PROGRAM BOTH CAPITAL EXPANSION PROJECTS WHERE YOU HAVE A CAPITALIZE OPERATES OF THE RESERVE. FOR FIVE YEARS AND THEN THE FACT ALLOCATED FIFTY FIVE MILLION FOR. YEN OPERATING. A SPEAKS TO WE NEED TO REVISIT THAT OUR REIMBURSEMENT PAYMENTS BECAUSE- I MEAN I DON'T THINK YOU CAN TELL SOMEONE WELL. YOU KNOW WHAT. YOU DON'T WORRY ABOUT UTILITIES. BECAUSE ON OUR SUBSIDIZING WELL DIFFERENTIALLY AT LEAST ONCE OF THE STOPS WE'RE GOING TO ASK. YOU KNOW THE THOUGHT THE PD TELECEL- OUR WATER. SO WE REALLY DO NEED I THINK THIS INDICATES THAT WE REALLY DO NEED TO LOOK AT THESE THINGS SO IT'S GREAT WE'RE PROVIDING. PEOPLE SOME TEMPORARY RELIEF. BUT YOU KNOW YOU DON'T BUILD A NEW BUILDING YOU PROVIDING A SUBSIDY FOR FIVE YEARS FOR. OPERATING SUBSIDY AND THEN AFTER FIVE YEARS IS OVER ESSENTIALLY THEY CAN'T STAY AFLOAT RIGHT. AND STAY NEEDED THAT SUBSIDY THAN- THAN- MAYBE THEY ALSO NEED. BETTER REIMBURSEMENT. I DO HAVE- AGAIN REALLY DO APPRECIATE THIS THIS INVESTMENT- OF. OF EIGHT HUNDRED FIVE MILLION- HE- THE CONSULT RESEARCH. WHAT'S THE WHAT ARE HOW MUCH OF HOW MUCH THAT THE HUNDRED FIVE NO. ARE THEY GETTING PAID. FOR THAT THE THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATOR YES- WE'RE WORKING ON OUR CONTRACT WITH THEM CURRENTLY BUT WE ANTICIPATE IT TO BE LESS THAN 5% OF THE BUDGET EVEN PROBABLY LESS THAN THAT. OKAY ALL RIGHT SO YOU NICELY STILL WORKING ON THAT HOPEFULLY IT'S LESS THAN 5% OKAY WELL WE'LL JUST. I MEAN IT- AND IT DOES STILL COST MONEY FOR SOME TO DO THEIR JOB SO I'M NOT SAYING IT'S- JUST WANT TO KNOW WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT AND THEN THE OTHER THE OTHER QUESTION I WOULD HAVE IS AGAIN YOU KNOW ANYTHING APPRECIATE THE INVESTMENT HERE- AND- TALKING ABOUT OVERLAPPING PROGRAM SO FORTH- SO. YOU KNOW PREVIOUSLY WE HAVE A HOUSING DISABILITY ADVOCACY PROGRAM. ASSIST PEOPLE EXPERIENCING OR AT RISK OF HOMELESSNESS I GUESS THIS IS THE AT RISK OF HOMELESSNESS ALSO LIKELY ELIGIBLE FOR DISABILITY BENEFITS. SO SEEMS LIKE SOME OVERLAP SO WHAT'S GOING TO BE THE INTEGRATION BETWEEN C. C. E. AND THE EIGHT STEP PROGRAM WHICH SEEMS TO BE SERVING AT LEAST SOMEWHAT SIMILAR POPULATIONS MAYBE I'M MISSING IT. MAYBE THEY ARE DIFFERENT- BUT I THINK IT WOULD BE NOTE THAT- WELL LISA PRESERVATION WE'RE TALKING TO PEOPLE ON SS I SS PIECE THAT'S PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. WE ALSO NOTE THAT EACH STEP PROGRAM OR BACKGROUND AT LEAST SAID THAT- THERE WERE FOUR THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED DISABILITY APPLICATION OF THIS ALL BACK TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN TO HELP TWO THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED PEOPLE SO IT LOOKS LIKE IT WAS OVERSUBSCRIBED. SO CAN WE TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW THESE TWO WHICH SEEMS TO DISTRICT SOMEWHERE POPULATIONS WILL BE COORDINATED INTEGRATED ARE- CONNECTED. OR IS THIS ARE WE GONNA FOLD EACH TAP INTO THIS ARE SO I JUST YEAH AGAIN BACK TO THE MULTIPLE PROGRAMS ISSUE. SO THEY CAN BE CARED. PROGRAM INTENDED TO BRING ON MORE RESIDENTIAL CARE SETTINGS OKAY MORE INDIVIDUALS SERVICE THROUGH FOR EXAMPLE THE AGE THAT PROGRAM OR FOR EXAMPLE THROUGH THE PROJECT CAN KEEP PROGRAMS. THOSE ARE IDENTIFIED THAT NEED A HIGHER LEVEL OR A LONGER TERM CARE. PLACEMENTS SETTING- WITH THE LEAST. AMOUNT OF RESTRICTIONS AND TO AVOID A FACILITY. OKAY SO- INSTITUTIONALIZATION EXCUSE WILL SELL YES WE DEFINITELY SEE A COORDINATION BETWEEN THE HOUSING AND DISABILITY ADVOCACY PROGRAM. AND THE COMMUNITY CARE EXPANSION MAKING SURE THAT THERE ARE LONGER TERM CARE OPTIONS. FOR INDIVIDUALS. HM FOR EXAMPLE THAT REQUIRE THAT LEVEL OF CARE OKAY SO CCP PROVIDES THE NEW. PLACEMENTS ARE LOCATIONS FOR PEOPLE WHO IN THAT SAME MIGHT NEED HOUSING AND H. WHO WERE TRYING TO HELP AN H. DAPPER ROOM KEY. THAT TELLING ME. OKAY AND REALLY ABOUT THE LONG TERM CARE CONTINUUM SENATORS RIGHT SO. IT'S REALLY BASED ON THE NEEDS OF THE INDIVIDUAL WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE GONNA NEED THAT THE LEVEL OF CARE THEY'RE GONNA NEED IN HAVING THOSE OPTIONS ALONG THAT CONTINUUM SO THAT'S REALLY. WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE WITH WITH THIS PROGRAM OKAY. AND I GUESS THE OTHER QUESTION A TYPICALLY WHAT THE PRESERVATION. PROJECTS- SO YOU KNOW SO WE'RE GOING TO BE INVESTING TO HUNDRED ONE FIFTY FIVE WILL BE FOR OPERATOR PIECE RIGHT SO THAT'S A ROUGHLY TWO HUNDRED MILLION- TO PRESERVE LICENSE FACILITIES NOW WHEN IT COMES TO THESE FACILITIES AND WE'RE PROVIDING. GRANTS TO- THE COUNTIES AND TRIBES PROVIDES FACILITIES. RECOGNIZING THAT AT LEAST IN CERTAIN PARTS OF THE STATE UNFORTUNATELY HAVE A HOUSING SHORTAGE AND- THAT'S DRIVING UP THE COST OF HOUSING BUT ALSO. DRIVING UP THE VALUE OF SOME OF THESE PROPERTIES AS WELL. HOW DO YOU HOW WELL THE THINK THAT THIS PROGRAM WILL BE SUBSCRIBER TO CLEAN THOSE COMMUNITIES ARE THERE RESTRICTIONS YOU RECEIVE FUNDS. FROM THIS PROGRAM TO PRESERVE THESE BEDS ARE THE RESTRICTIONS ON YOUR ABILITY TO THEN SELL OUR- YOU KNOW VISIBILITY WHICH- MAYBE THE BUILDINGS WERE THOUGHT BECOMES FOURTH WORSE A LOT OF MONEY OR SOMETHING. SO HOW WE GONNA BALANCE THAT OUT- IN TERMS OF- IN TERMS OF TRYING TO PRESERVE. BEDS FOR- FAMILY SO JUST RECOGNIZING IT'S PART OF THE STATE WHERE HOUSING VALUES ARE PROPERTY VALUES ARE GOING UP DESPERATE MORE ACTIVE DESCRIPTION. AND AND THEN PEOPLE ALSO- AND IN TERMS OF- PEOPLE SUBSCRIBING FOR THESE FUNDS. AND AND BEING ABLE TO ENSURE THAT WERE ABLE TO PRESERVE THESE FACILITIES- IN THE LIGHT OF THE FACT THAT THERE MAY BE ALTERNATIVE USES THAT ARE LESS HELPFUL IN THE SOCIAL SERVICE SIDE BUT- ACTUALLY MAKE. THREE GIVE GREATER RETURN FOR THE OWNERS- SOAKING EUSTICE SPEAK TO HOW THAT MIGHT BE ADDRESSED AND WHETHER WE'RE GONNA SEE AN ISSUE WITH- PEOPLE SUBSCRIBING TO THIS PARTICULAR. PROGRAM PARTICULARLY IN THOSE COMMUNITIES. SO ON THE CAPITALIST. PROJECT THERE IS A REQUIREMENT FOR A USE RESTRICTION. SO THERE THERE'S A THIRTY YEAR USE RESTRICTION FOR ANY NEW FACILITY THAT'S CONSTRUCTED AND A TWENTY YEAR USE RESTRICTION FOR ANY CURRENT FACILITY OPERATOR. LOOKING TO EXPAND THEIR SERVICES SO THAT'S FOR THE POPULATION MOVING FORWARD. OKAY AND- YOU DON'T AND AGAIN I DON'T DISAGREE WITH THE USE RESTRICTION AFTER ALL WE'RE INVESTING MONEY INTO IT BUT DO YOU SEE THAT THERE WE MIGHT HAVE SOME CHALLENGES A CERTAIN PARTS OF THE STATE WHERE SOMEONE MAY NOT BE WILLING TO SIGN UP FOR A TWENTY YEAR. RESTRICTION GIVEN THAT THE- THE SPEED AT WHICH- VALUE PROPERTY VALUES MAY BE CHANGING ARE RISING PARTICULAR AND THOSE PARTICULAR REGIONS OF STATE. IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE TRACKING AND WORKING TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE ON TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE DRYING IN- APPLICANTS AND HELPING THEM TO FACILITATE THE APPLICATION PROCESS SO THAT. THE GOALS OF THE PROGRAM CAN BE ACHIEVED OKAY ALL RIGHT WELL I HOPE THAT NOW AGAIN I DON'T REALLY HAVE A SOLUTION MYSELF BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO MONITOR AND SEE BECAUSE WHAT I REALLY HATE TO DO IS WE ALLOCATE THIS BUDGET THIS MONEY. YOU PUT THE MONEY OUT THERE AND PEOPLE DON'T SIGN UP FOR EIGHT AND- AND THEN WE FIND OUT THAT WE DON'T REALLY HAVE AS MANY FACILITIES AS WE HELP WE DON'T HAVE THE FOURTH OUT THE SEVEN THOUSAND BEDS THAT YOU'RE PROJECTING BECAUSE PEOPLE AREN'T SIGNING UP FOR ITSELF- SO HOPEFULLY YOU CAN PROVIDE US WITH UPDATES ON THAT AS THIS ROLLS OUT SO THAT WE ARE WHERE YOU KNOW WE MAY HAVE CERTAIN PARTS OF STATE WORDS GOOD OTHER PARTS THAT. DIDN'T SELL AND DISTINTA WE'RE FIGHTING THESE FUNDS IN A NON COMPETITIVE WAY TO ALL COUNTIES THAT'S GREAT I THINK EVERYONE SHOULD BE ABLE TO BENEFIT BUT I SAID WHAT IS THE UP TAKEN THESE VARIOUS COUNTIES ESPECIALLY GIVEN YOUR PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES. ALL RIGHT SO NOW I APPRECIATE IT I THINK THIS IS YOU KNOW CERTAINLY YOU KNOW PROGRAM WE WANT TO BE SUPPORT OF- BUT I ALSO WANT TO BE SURE THAT- IT WE WERE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT IT AND. I KNOW THAT YOU'RE WORKING HARD ON THAT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I. A I THINK DIRECTOR. AND ANNA AND- ALL THE- AB. ALL THE THERE HAVE HAVE BEEN VERY- RECEPTIVE TO THE IDEA OF NO WRONG DOOR AND MAKING IT AS EASY AS POSSIBLE TO APPLY. NOT JUST FOR THE INDIVIDUALS THAT FOR THE COUNTIES AND AGENCIES AS WELL- BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW EVER THE- FROM THE STATE LEVEL DOWN TO THE- TO THE CITY AND DRIVING COUNTY LEVEL EVERYBODY STRUGGLING WITH THE WORK FORCE ISSUE. AND SO- THE EASIER WE CAN MAKE IT TO GET THAT MONEY OUT. AND GUARD AGAINST FRAUD- IS A YEOMAN'S TASK AND WE- WE APPRECIATE THAT YOU ARE EMBRACING IT- AND CONTINUE TO LIFT IT UP IN A LIGHT SO THAT WE CAN ALL TAKE A LOOK AT IT. HOW WILL CONTINUE ON THIS PROCESS TOGETHER- SO I THINK YOU VERY MUCH AND THAT IS ALL FOR THE PRESENTATIONS TODAY. I EIGHT WILL NOW GO TO PUBLIC COMMENTS MODERATOR ARE YOU THERE.
