AS OPEN ON THE BILL I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE AND HONOR TO SIT UNDER THE GAZE OF IRELAND TO HOLD OVER THERE I WORKED WITH HER AND SHE SUCCESSFULLY IMPROVE THE SENATE BY GETTING ELECTED TO THE ASSEMBLY- OR TOLERATING IT IS THAT HAPPENED ACTIONS. ANYWAY I THINK WE'RE BETTER OFF. AREA. GOOD MORNING MR CHARMERS I'M HERE TODAY TO PRESENT A. B. TWENTY ONE FIFTY FOUR THIS STREAMLINES THE CONFERENCE ROOMS GUARANTY ASSOCIATION ABILITY MAKE FUNDING READILY ACCESSIBLE AND LESS COSTLY TO ACCESS SO IT'S A SINGLE BILL AND SICK OF COURSE IS THE FIRST LINE OF DEFENSE FOR CONSUMERS IS RATE MAKING TO MAKE SURE THAT RATES ARE ADEQUATE FOR INSURANCE. BUT IF THERE'S EVER THE EVENTUAL OF AN INSURANCE COMPANY THAT STUMBLES AND RUNS INTO INSOLVENCY THAN CIGNA KICKS IN SILVER SO THE ADVERSE EFFECTS OF INSUFFICIENT REYES DOESN'T FALLING CONSUMER THE SYSTEM KICKS IN AND ALL CHARACTERS IN THAT LINE. OOPS SO THIS IS A SEEK A BILL SUPPORTING THIS ROLE OF PROTECTING CONSUMERS THERE ARE. SEGA'S CURRENT SUBJECT TO TWO STATUES WHICH ALLOW C. COULD ISSUE BONDS BONDS AS A SOURCE OF REVENUE IN THE EVENT OF A NEEDING FUNDS TO COVER. COVERED CLAIMS ONE DEALS WITH NATURAL DISASTER OF IMMENSE- AND THE SECOND WAS TO WORKERS COMPENSATION BONDS SOLD TO LARGER AS WE CAN HAVE AN INORDINATE YOUR CLAIMS THAT CUTTING IT WITH THE ADVERSE TIMING FOR THE INSURANCE SYSTEM. ARM AND OF THE BOND TO PROVIDE REVENUE THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE WHEN EXISTING FUNDS AND ASSESSMENTS ARE NOT SERVICE TO COVER CLAIMS. AB TWENTY ONE FIFTY FOUR REPEALS THE PROVISIONS FOR THE SIG ISSUANCE OF NATURAL DISASTER BONDS. WHICH IS A SEPARATE PROVISION. AND REVISES THE BOND PROVISIONS FOR WORKERS COMP TO INCLUDE DENTAL DISASTER AS WELL. SO IT'S CONSOLIDATES THIS BOND AUTHORITY INSEEGO UNDER ONE STEP TOWARD MECHANISM. OF STREAMLINED THE PROCESS FOR COMBINED THESE TWO STATUTES WILL MAKE IT A SINGLE BONDAGE WAS MORE EFFICIENT. ON THERE'S ALSO A- SINCE EVERY KERRIER IS SUPPOSED TO HELP SUPPORT THE SYSTEM AND BEARS SURCHARGES THAT GO ACROSS ALL THOSE IDENTICAL PRODUCTS THERE IS A POTENTIAL GAP IN THE CIGNA STATUTE PERTAINING TO THE NEW MEMBER SURCHARGE CURRENTLY THE SURCHARGES BASED ON THE SICK IS A SEPARATE FROM A PREVIOUS YEAR. IF YOU WERE A NEW CARRIER ON THE MARKET YOU DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE A PREVIOUS YEAR SO THERE'S NOT A CARE SURCHARGE MECHANISM. AND RATHER LET A NEW CARRIER SALAS PRODUCT BELOW THE SURCHARGE RATE FOR A YEAR WHICH IS NOT. FAIR TO EVERYBODY WHO HAS THIS OBLIGATION BE A PARSI GO. ON THIS BILL ADDRESSES THAT ISSUE. OF WHEN A NEW COMPANY BECOMES LIGHTS A CALIFORNIA COMPANY COLLECTS THE SURCHARGE YOU DOES NOT RECEIVED ASSESSMENT. THE SEARCH ARE DUE TO BE COLLECTED AS I SEE TO AVOID OUT FOR COMPETITION. THIS BILL ACTUALLY REQUIRES YOU GET A OUT DROPPED A PLAN OF OPERATION REQUIRES ALL MEMBER INSURERS RECOUP DISKS. TO CHARGE PAPER MATURE THROUGH A SURCHARGE OF PREMIUMS CHARGED FOR INSURANCE POLICIES IN THE YEAR FOLLOWING THE PREMIUM CHARGE. ANY SURCHARGES COLLECTED DID BE REMITTED TO SEE GOOD USED. TO PAY FUTURE INSOLVENCIES. FIVE SICK HAS IDENTIFIED ISSUES WITH CYBERSECURITY POLICIES. BECAUSE THESE POLICIES TAILORED TO A VERY SPECIFIC TYPE OF PROBLEM- THERE ARE CERTAIN BENEFITS WHICH ARE NOT ALWAYS CONSIDERED INSURANCE IS FOR TO GET INTO A GRAY AREA SADE UNIQUE TO CALIFORNIA ALL GUARANTEED SO SHE'S FACED SIMILAR ISSUES. SO SIGNAL IS TERRIFYING IN CALIFORNIA'S DID REMOVE ANY AMBIGUITIES AS TO COVERAGE. AND SEE FOR A CYBER SECURITY PRODUCT CLARIFIES OF CYBER SECURITY POLICIES ARE COVERED CLAIMS AS LONG AS HE GETS TOTAL LIABILITIES NOW EXCEED ONE MILLION DOLLARS OR THE POLICY LIMITS WHICHEVER IS LESS. OUR BY DRESSING THESE GAPS IN CEDAR STATUTE THIS WILL ALLOW YOU SO SHOULD QUICK RESPOND WHEN CANCER RENTS RESULT IN INSOLVENCIES. AND CALIFORNIA SEEK RELEASE. A SEEK RELIEF PARTLY AB TWENTY ONE FIFTY FOUR SUPPORT BY SEEK AND RECEIVE NO OPPOSITION AND I'M DELIGHTED TO HAVE- JOHN NORWOOD HERE'S BEGINS THE SUPPORT THE BILL FOR SIKA. ROLE WITH. THEM THE- GERMAN MEMBERS JOHN NOR WOULD I BE AFTER THE CALIFORNIA INSURANCE GUARANTY ASSOCIATION HAPPY TO ANSWERING QUESTIONS I DON'T THINK I CAN ADD TOO MUCH MORE. THAN THAT MR COOLEY IS ALREADY DONE BUT I THINK IS REALLY CRITICAL TO CLARIFY THAT A CYBER INSURANCE IS A COVERED CLAIM UNDER US AGAIN THAT THIS BILL DOES THAT AND SECONDLY IT MADE NOTHING BUT SENSE TO TAKE THE TO STATUTES AUTHORIZING. US TO GET ISSUE BONDS IN THE- EVENT OF A- CASH FLOW CRISIS AND PUT IT INTO THE ONE- AUTHORITY THAT'S BEEN USED AND HAS PROVEN TO BE VERY SUCCESSFUL AND EFFICIENT SO- FOR THOSE REASONS WE SUPPORT THE BILL AND- DRIVE UP THANK YOU VERY MUCH ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU. NOR WOULD- WE WILL IN. ANY SUPPORTING TESTIMONY ON THIS BILL AT THIS POINT. ARE THERE ANY PERSONS HERE WHO WE WISH TO SPEAK IN FAVOR OF THE BILL. LET'S GO THEN TO OUR PHONE LINES WHICH IS OUR PRACTICE- MR OPERATOR ARE YOU WITH US. YES A RESEARCHER WE ARE WAITING FOR YOU. BEAUTIFUL WOULD YOU WERE.

AND MR OPERATOR IS THERE ANYONE ON THE PHONE LINE WHO WISHES TO SPEAK AGAINST THE BILL. WHEN ONCE AGAIN TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO AT THIS TIME. AND ONCE AGAIN MR SURE WE HAVE NO RESPONDENTS THINK. THANK YOU SIR A COMMITTEE MEMBERS SO WE DON'T HAVE A QUORUM YET SO WE WON'T BE VOTING HAVE YET ON THIS BILL BUT DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME. MR VOEPEL. NOT A QUESTION JUST A- COMMENT ON THE BILL WONDERFUL BILL AND I REMIND THE COMMITTEE THAT- WHEN COMPANIES GO BROKE USUALLY BETWEEN CIGNA AND INSURANCE COMMISSIONER THEY FIND A CONSORTIUM OR OTHER COMPANIES THAT WILL BY THE BROKE COMPANIES SO THIS IS SIMPLY LIKE THE THIRD BACKSTOP IN THE SYSTEM. GREAT BILL THANK YOU SIR THANK YOU FOR COMING THANK YOU MR VOEPEL ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. MYLEX AKON IF NOT WE WILL- WILL BE VOTING ON THAT AT THE- WHEN THE OPPORTUNITY PRESENTS ITSELF THANK YOU FOR THAT BILL MR COOLEY THANK YOU MISTER NORWOOD. AND NOW WE'RE HEARING AB TWENTY FIVE SIXTY EIGHT ALSO BY MR COOLEY. VERY GOOD. YOU SCOTT. WERE GO AHEAD CAN OUR COLLEAGUES AND PLEASED TO BE HERE PRESENT THIS BILL AND- THIS IS ABOUT THE SHORTEST INSURANCE BILL YOU WILL ENCOUNTER- LOOKS LIKE ABOUT- SEVEN EIGHT LINES OF TEXT THE UPSHOT IS THERE ARE THREE VERY IMPORTANT CLASSIFICATIONS OF REGULAR REGULATED ENTITIES UNDER INSURANCE. THEY ARE PRODUCERS OF SURPLUS LINES BROKERS AND LIFE AND DISABILITY INSURANCE ANALYSTS HERE BROAD CLASSES OF LICENSEES SMALL BUSINESS PEOPLE VERY OFTEN AND- THIS BILL ACTUALLY RELATES TO THE FACT THAT THROUGH TIME INSURANCE SORT OF JUST ITSELF TO WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE WORLD YEAH. BECAUSE IN TWENTY FIFTEEN WE IN THE LEGISLATURE FINALLY WROTE THE RULES FOR MEDICAL CANNABIS BY TWENTY SIXTEEN TO VOTERS APPROVED MORE BROADLY IN THE STATE. AND A LOT IS IN SUIT FROM THAT AND THE ISSUE OF THIS BILL IS SIMPLY. IF A PRODUCER SURPLUS LINES BROKER LIFE AND DISABILITY ANALYST IS DOING SOMETHING INVOLVING WRITING MARIJUANA DO THEY VIOLATE THEIR LICENSING LAW IN THIS BILL SAYS NO SO THAT'S KIND OF THE NATURAL ON THE BILL DIDN'T TAKE VERY. TO ME LINES WHICH HAVES OF THOSE THREE CLASS OF LICENSEES ARE NOT- DO NOT COMMIT A CRIME UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW SOLELY PROVIDING INSURANCE RELATED SERVICES TO PERSONS LICENSE GAUGING COMMERCIAL CANNABIS ACTIVITY. SO- AS I SAY VOTERS APPROVED USYK CANVAS FOR MEDICAL PURPOSES IN NINETY SIX BEGIN TO PRODUCE OF ADULT CANNABIS USE IN TWENTY SIXTEEN. OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS CALPERS WERE TO STAND UP AND WILL REGULATE CANNABIS MARKET PLACE. AN AREA WHERE COMMERCIAL ACTIVITY HAS LAGGED HOWEVER HAS BEEN INSURANCE COVERAGE. ALTHOUGH CANVASES FEDERALLY ILLEGAL LONGSTANDING GUIDELINES FROM THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT TO ALLOW FOR INSTITUTIONS TO WORK OR CAMPUS BUSINESSES PROVIDED THEY FOLLOW CERTAIN. EXTRA REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. THERE'S ALSO FEDERAL CASE LAW INDICATES DONORS GREEN EARTH WELLNESS CENTER VERSES ATTAINS PROVENCHER AND COMPANY. THAT'S A TWENTY SIXTEEN CASE THAT ESTABLISHED THAT FEDERAL CLASSIFICATION CANVAS IS NOT RELEVANT IN AN INSURANCE PROVIDERS DETERMINES TO WRITE AN INSURANCE POLICY. AND THEN WE ALSO HAVE FROM NINETEEN FORTY FIVE THE MCCARRAN FERGUSON ACT A FEDERAL LAW WHICH STATES HAS STATES REGULATE THEIR OWN INSURANCE MARKETPLACES NOT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. SO IS THE COMMERCIAL MARKET HAS GROWN FOR CANNABIS SO HAS THE NEED FOR INSURANCE FOR CULTIVATORSTESTING LABS- AND RETAIL CURRENTLY ONLY EIGHT IT BEEN INSURERS PROVIDE INSURANCE FOR CANVASSING CALIFORNIA- AND WHILE THERE ARE MANY SURPLUS LINE INSURERS ARE PROVIDING SURE SIR POLICIES ONLY COVER THE RETAIL MARKET. AUTOMATION TESTING COVERAGE WHICH REQUIRES A CORPORATION ADMITTED INSURERS PROVIDE PRODUCT IS NOT COVERED. AS A RESULT THERE IS A SHORTAGE IN PROVIDERS AND COVERAGE IN THE CALIFORNIA CANNABIS MARKET PLACE. AND AS WITH ANY BUSINESS IT'S IMPORTANT A COMMERCIAL CANNABIS BUSINESSES ALL PRESENT A CALIFORNIA LAW HAVE ACCESS TO BROAD INSURANCE PRODUCTS TO SUPPORT THEIR SURVIVAL AS A BUSINESS LINE. SO THIS BILL TERRIFIED TO RUN INSURANCE FOR COMMERCIAL CANNABIS DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A CRIME SINCE CANVAS IS PART OF A LEGAL REGULATED MARKET IN CALIFORNIA- IT DOES NOT MANDATE THE CREATION OF A PRODUCT. AND ALWAYS USED TO CLARIFY EXISTING PRAXIS STATUE TO ENCOURAGE GREATER PARTICIPATION MARKETPLACE AS I SAID IT DOESN'T BY. CLARIFYING THE LICENSING STATUTES FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE NOT RUN AFOUL OF THE LAW. OF THE BILL IS SUPPORTED BY THE CALIFORNIA FARM CHURCH IT HAS RECEIVED OFF. OPPOSITION I BELIEVE MICHAEL MARTINEZ WILL JOIN US- TO OFFER TEST WHEN SUPPORT THE BILL FOR COMMISSIONER LARA. THANK YOU MR COOLEY WE HAVE A QUORUM OF PRESENCE SO WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD.

THIS BILL SIMPLY EXTENDS THE JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY THREE SUNSET DATE FOR THE CURRENT COVERT RELATED WORKERS COMPENSATION PRESUMPTIONS STANDS FOR TWO MORE YEARS UNTIL JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. THE TWO PRESUMPTIONS IN THIS BILL RECUPERATED BY S. B. ELEVEN FIFTY NINE IN TWENTY TWENTY WHICH I JOIN AUTHORED- WITH THE SENATOR. JERRY HILL. ACTUALLY I WAS PRINCIPAL CO AUTHOR. THE TWO PRESUMPTIONS PROVIDE FOR REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION THAT A PEACE OFFICER FIREFIGHTER SPECIFIED FRONTLINE EMPLOYEES IN CERTAIN HEALTH CARE EMPLOYEES WHO CONTRACT COVERT NINETEEN WERE INFECTED WITH THE VIRUS AT THE WORK PLACE AND THE SECOND ESTABLISHES A REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION FOR EMPLOYEES WHO CONTRACT OVER NINETEEN FROM ANY EMPLOYER THAT EXPERIENCES AN OUTBREAK. OF KOBE NINETEEN CASES AT A PARTICULAR WORK LOCATION. EXTENDING THESE PRESUMPTIONS WILL ALLOW WORKERS IMPACTED BY COVERT NINETEEN TO MORE EASILY ACCESS THE WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM AND RECEIVE THE CARE AND SUPPORT THEY NEED WITHOUT DELAY. ALSO IT WILL ENCOURAGE WORKERS WHO CONTRACT THE VIRUS AT THE WORK PLACE TO REMAIN HOME AND RECEIVE CARE INSTEAD OF FURTHER SPREADING THE ILLNESS AS A SPREAD OF CLOVER NINETEEN HOPEFULLY DIMINISHES. CLAIMS WILL NATURALLY DECREASE AND PRESUMPTIONS WILL BE USED LESS FREQUENTLY BUT STILL REMAIN AVAILABLE FOR THOSE IN NEED. HERE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL IS MAY CONSUMERS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS. THANK YOU MEGAN GO AHEAD THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MAKE CONSUMERS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS. BUT WE WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE CHAIR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD AND ALSO THE ORIGINAL BILL SB ELEVEN FIFTY NINE. BUT WE ARE OBVIOUSLY IN A IN A BETTER CONDITION IN TERMS OF KOPET NINETEEN RIGHT NOW BUT WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO STAY AHEAD. OF THE VARIANTS THAT- WE'VE SEEN AND THE ONES THAT COULD BE COMING- SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE THINK EXTENDING THIS PRESUMPTION. IS IMPORTANT TO ENSURE THAT- FRONTLINE WORKERS INCLUDING FIREFIGHTERS HAVE ACCESS TO THE WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM AND- TIMELY ACCESS TO MEDICAL TREATMENT IF THEY ARE DIAGNOSED WITH THIS WORK RELATED- I ILLNESS AND SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MR VOEPEL A THIS CAN BE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR COMMITTEE QUESTIONS OR WILL WE CAN GO STRAIGHT TO THE- PHONE IN TESTIMONY I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYONE ELSE HERE IN THE ROOM WHO WANTS TO SPEAK. IS THERE ANYONE IN THE HEARING ROOM IT WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK. GOING TO THE PHONES IN SUPPORT.

WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THEIR WORK ON THE BILL- OUR COALITION OPPOSE THE PASSAGE OF SB ELEVEN FIFTY NINE AND TWENTY TWENTY BUT WE WORKED IN GOOD FAITH WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS TO PASS THE TIME LIMITED EMERGENCY MEASURE THAT WENT THE EXTRA MILE TO PROTECT WORKERS IN THE MIDST OF AN UNFOLDING PANDEMIC TO BE CLEAR CALIFORNIA EMPLOYERS HAVE STEPPED UP TO THE PLATE RESPONSIBLY FIELDED OVER A QUARTER MILLION WORKERS COMPENSATION CLAIMS FOR COVERED NINETEEN. WE BELIEVE THAT THE LEGISLATURE COULD SAFELY ALLOW THIS POLICY TO SUNSET HAS PLANNED ON JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY THREE THIS IS FOR SEVERAL REASONS VERY QUICKLY- FIRST THERE ARE MULTIPLE VACCINES AVAILABLE TO EMPLOYEES WHO WISH TO PROTECT THEMSELVES FROM THE MOST SEVERE CONSEQUENCES OF COVERT NINETEEN SECONDS THE CALLOW J. EGS PROVIDES EXTENSIVE PROTECTION TO EMPLOYEES AND MAKES THE WORKPLACE AMONG THE SAFER ENVIRONMENTS OUT THERE- AND THIRD THE PRESUMPTION IS DONE ITS JOB IT PROVIDED BROAD AND HINDERED ACCESS TO THE WORKERSCOMPENSATION SYSTEM IN THE MIDST OF A PANDA UNFOLDING PANDEMIC. BUT THE CONDITIONS HAVE CHANGED SUBSTANTIALLY SO DESPITE OUR BELIEF THAT THE PRESUMPTION COULD SAFELY SUNSET- WE UNDERSTAND WHY LEGISLATORS MIGHT NOT BE READY TO MAKE THAT DECISION CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE- AND THE CODE NINETEEN ROLLER COASTERS TAUGHT US ALL TO BE CAUTIOUS WE UNDERSTAND THAT FOR THAT REASON WE WOULD BE WILLING TO REMOVE OPPOSITION TO THE CONTINUATION OF THIS PRESUMPTION UNDER TWO CIRCUMSTANCES- ONE- ON THE CONDITION THAT NO DETAILS OF THE UNDERLYING POLICY CHANGE SO THAT THE POLICY. THAT WAS NEGOTIATED IN 2020% IT'S- INTO IN THE IS THE AND- PIECE- BUT YOU KNOW RELATIVE TO WHAT'S IN THE CURRENT- IF THE BILL WERE AMENDED TO EXT. THE SUNSET FOR ONE YEAR INSTEAD OF TWO- IF IT'S NEEDED FOR TO THE LEGISLATURE COULD ALWAYS DECIDE TO COME BACK AND DO THAT AGAIN NEXT YEAR- BUT WE DON'T SEE ANY REASON TO EXTEND IT FOR TWO YEARS. AT THIS POINT- AND WITHOUT THAT CONCLUDES MY COMMENTS AND I THINK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. VERY WELL THANK YOU. ANY ONE ELSE. ON THE PHONE IN OPPOSITION. VERY WELL AND- THERE WAS TWO SUGGESTIONS. THERE WAS TWO SUGGESTIONS FOR AN AMENDMENT- DOES THE AUTHOR WANT TO DO ANY AMENDMENTS. OF READ RESPECTFULLY ALL DECLINE NOW. THOSE SUGGESTIONS AT THIS TIME ROGER THAT THEY'RE WELL TAKEN BONTA.
