EVERYONE AND WELCOME TO OUR FIRST HEARING THIS YEAR OF THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE ON CLIMATE CHANGE POLICIES. TODAY'S INFORMATIONAL HEARING WILL BE ON THE ANNUAL UPDATE ON STATEWIDE TRENDS OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. AS WELL AS AN OVERVIEW OF THE TWENTY TWENTY TO SCOPING PLAN. A BEFORE WE BEGAN I WANT TO. MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE IS AWARE THAT TO DO THE- ONGOING PANDEMIC THAT WE HAVE A MASK REQUIREMENT FOR ALL INDIVIDUALS IN THE HEARING ROOM. WE ARE ACCEPTING PUBLIC COMMENT AT THE END OF THIS HEARING FROM THOSE- HERE IN PERSON. THOSE APPEARING REMOTELY ON THE NORTH STEPS OF THE CAPITOL AND FROM THOSE CALLING BY PHONE. THE CALL IN BY PHONE AND THE PHONE NUMBER IS. TOLL FREE. THE ACCESS CODE IS. ONE THREE ONE FIVE FOUR THREE SEVEN AGAIN THAT IS ONE THREE ONE. FIVE FOUR THREE SEVEN. EACH PERSON- DURING THE PUBLIC COMMENT WILL HAVE ONE MINUTE- TO SPEAK. AND WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO BEGIN THE HEARING. TODAY'S HEARING IS INTENDED TO NOT ONLY MEET- OUR STATUTORY REQUIREMENT FOR THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD TO PROVIDE THIS COMMITTEE WITH AN ANNUAL UPDATE ON STATEWIDE TRENDS OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. BUT AS THE AND JENNA INDICATES- WE- WILL BE DISCUSSING MUCH MORE. WE ALL KNOW THAT- HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE ARE. SEEING IMMEDIATELY VIA FAX OF THE CLIMATE CRISIS WITH THE WILD FIRES THE EXTREME DROUGHT. THE EXTREME HEAT- SEALEVEL RISE AND IN SO MANY MORE REALITIES THAT CALIFORNIANS ARE FACING ON A DAY TO DAY BASIS. GIVEN THE URGENCY OF THE MOMENT GIVEN THE TIMING OF THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD'S SCOPING PLAN. THE RECENT- INTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE. REPORT AS WELL AS THE GOVERNOR'S RECENT LETTER ASKING THE A ARE BE TO LOOK AT WHETHER- THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA CAN ACHIEVE CARBON NEUTRALITY- EARLIER ON EARLIER TIMELINE BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THIS COMMITTEE TO HAVE A DEEPER DISCUSSION WITH THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD ON ITS PLANS FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY TWO SCOPING PLAN. AS WELL AS THEIR EVALUATION OF OUR PROGRESS TOWARD THE NEAR TERM. TWENTY THIRTY GOLD THE STATUTORY TWENTY THIRTY GOAL- AS- CODIFIED. THROUGH SENATE BILL THIRTY TWO. AS WELL AS THEIR WORK ON CHARTING A PATH TOWARD CARBON NEUTRALITY. AS SUCH THE ARB WILL REPEAT BE PRESENTING ON EACH OF THESE ITEMS AS INDICATED ON THE AGENDA. FOR IN ADDITION TO THE A. R. BE ABLE TO GIVE AN OVERVIEW OF OUR THE REST OF OUR AGENDA WE WILL ALSO BE HEARING- FROM. TO REPRESENTATIVES OF THE INDEPENDENT EMISSIONS MARKET ADVISORY COMMITTEE- BE HEARING FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. AS WELL AS A FROM A DIVERSE GROUP OF STAKEHOLDERS ON THEIR VIEWS ON THESE TOPICS THAT WILL BE ADDRESSING TODAY. I WE WILL ALSO LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING THEIR SUGGESTIONS ON WHAT THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD BE CONSIDERING AS WE DELIBERATE A PATH TOWARD CARBON NEUTRALITY. I WOULD LIKE TO ENCOURAGE ALL OF THE SPEAKERS TODAY TO- SUBMIT WRITTEN COMMENTS TO THIS COMMITTEE- THIS COMMITTEE WILL BE PUBLISHING. A FOLLOW UP DOCUMENT- AFTER THIS HEARING THAT WILL SUMMARIZE- THE VERBAL AS WELL AS- WRITTEN COMMENTS. SUBMITTED TODAY. THIS DOCUMENT- WILL- NOT ONLY CAPTURE WHAT IS DISCUSSED TODAY BUT- FORMULATE- SUGGESTIONS FOR OUR NEXT STEPS FOR THE LEGISLATURE- THESE SUGGESTIONS WOULD BE IN THE FORM OF ACTIONABLE ITEMS FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER AND PURSUE- SO WITH THAT I WOULD LIKE TO. NOW TURN OVER THE FIRST TO THE VICE CHAIR THIS COMMITTEE- CENTER BACKER AND TO THE- OTHER MEMBERS OF THIS JOINT COMMITTEE. STE THANK YOU OF A FEW I THANK THE CHAIR OKAY. RIGHT GOT IT. THANK YOU I'D LIKE TO THANK THE CHAIR AND HIS TEAM FOR THE WORK PREPARING FOR AS A KID THE A HEARING TODAY AND ALLOW US TO MAKE SOME OPENING COMMENTS I ALSO WANT TO THANK VERY MUCH ALL THE PANELISTS THAT WE'LL HEAR FROM TODAY. FOR SHARING THEIR EXPERTISE AND KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCES WITH US- AS THE CHAIR MENTION IT'S HARD TO THINK OF A TOPIC MORE IMPORTANT THAN THIS ONE- WITH LARGE PARTS OF OUR STATE OUR OUR LITTLE ON FIRE AND EXPERIENCE A HISTORIC DROUGHT- BOTH EVIDENCE. OF THE- IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE ALREADY. I THINK WE'RE AT A CRUCIAL POINT. I WAS REMARKING RESET MEMBER IN SCENA FIRST PROTOTYPE ELECTRIC VEHICLE IN NINETEEN NINETY ONE WE WERE. PREPARING FOR THE CLEANER MARKET PLACE CONFERENCE AS HELPING THE EPA LAUNCH AT THE TIME. AND I REMEMBER THINKING THIS WOULD BE ON THE ROAD IN NO TIME WE'LL SEE DRAMATIC PROGRESS- AND OBVIOUSLY. THE PROGRESS WAS LIMITED BUT THAT IT WAS REALLY LIMITED BY THE TECHNOLOGY WE REALLY WEREN'T QUITE READY AT THAT TIME. AND NOW THINGS ARE DIFFERENT. BUT THE TECHNOLOGY IS CLEARLY THERE TO ACCOMPLISH OUR GOALS. AND SO WITH THAT IT REALLY IS A POLICY. QUESTION CALIFORNIA NEEDS POLICIES TO SPEED UP THE DEPLOYMENT OF TECHNOLOGIES WE ALREADY HAVE. AND RIDE THE RIGHT INCENTIVE SO ENGINEERS ENTREPRENEURS CAN CONTINUE TO WORK ON NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND REFINING AND SPEEDING UP THE ONES WE HAVE WHETHER THAT BE A SOLAR WIND GEOTHERMAL- LOW CARBON CEMENT AND LOTS OF OTHER AREAS. THE NEWS FROM THE I PCC IS EXTREMELY ALARMING AND THE SITUATION IS EVEN MUCH MORE DIRE THAN WE THOUGHT SO AS LEGISLATORS AND POLICY MAKERS IT'S REALLY UP TO US CALIFORNIA'S ALWAYS BEEN A GLOBAL LEADER IN CLIMATE POLICY. SO WHAT WE DO MATTERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND ACROSS THE WORLD. AND IF WE SUCCEED WE PROVIDE A ROADMAP TO OTHERS IF WE FAIL TO PROGRESSIVE PASSED ENOUGH. THEN YOU KNOW HOW TO EXPECT OTHER STATES AND COUNTRIES TO DO SO I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH ALL MEMBERS. OF THIS COMMITTEE AND WITH THE CHAIR TO MAKE SURE THE CALIFORNIA DOES SUCCEED. ASSESSING FOR THE REST OF WORLD TO FOLLOW THANK YOU. THANKS VERY MUCH CENTER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH CENTER BACKER. WOULD ANY OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE LIKE TO CENTER SKINNER. THANK YOU CARE AND- VICE CHAIR- APPRECIATE YOUR COORDINATING AND SETTING THIS HEARING UP AND THE PANELISTS THAT WE'RE ABOUT TO HEAR FROM AND THE COMMENTS THAT YOU BOTH MADE- WE CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN VERY GOOD. AT SENDING VERY STRONG MARKE SIGNALS THAT HAVE HELPED US. ON THIS PROCESS OF OR ARE TRANSITION TO DECARBONIZE OUR ECONOMY AND WE CAN LOOK AT THE SUCCESS OF SOLAR WE CAN LOOK AT THE SUCCESS AT MULTIPLE ELECTRIC VEHICLES. ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES SO MUCH MORE- BUT WE'RE AT A CROSSROADS ACROSS I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT. I'D EVERY TERMINOLOGY AND I MIGHT CHOOSE TO USE RIGHT NOW SEEMS TRIVIAL CONSIDERING THE ENORMITY OF THE CRISIS THAT WE ARE FACING RIGHT NOW AND THE SCIENCE. THE CLARITY OF THE SCIENCE THAT THE I. P. P. C. REPORT JUST REVEALED. AND SO WHAT I AM ALSO INTERESTED IN CLEARLY I WANT US TO CONTINUE TO SEND VERY STRONG MARKET SIGNALS BUT I ONE OF US TO ALSO MAKE SURE THAT WE LOOK AT. THOSE WAYS THAT WE CAN CAPTURE CARBON AND BY THAT I DON'T MEAN ONLY THAT CAPTURING CARBON SAY AT A FOSSIL FUEL FACILITY BUT RATHER. IN ALL OF THE NATURAL SYSTEMS BECAUSE THERE IS THE I. P. P. REPORT ALSO REVEALS THAT THERE IS GREAT CAPACITY WITHIN OUR NATURAL SYSTEMS SOILS. GRASSLANDS OTHERS TO DO THAT FOR US IN ADDITION TO VARIOUS TECHNOLOGIES AND TECHNOLOGICAL WAYS TO DO IT AND I- IT'S UNDERSTANDABLE THAT WE MAY NOT HAVE FOCUSED ON THAT BECAUSE OUR- FOCUS TO DATE LEGITIMATELY HAS BEEN AN EMISSIONS REDUCTION. BUT I THINK WE ALSO NEED TO GREATLY- FOCUS IN THAT AREA AND I'M CURIOUS TO HEAR FROM. OUR PANELISTS- THOUGHTS ON THAT SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH CENTER SKINNER. ASSEMBLY MEMBER. I WASN'T PLANNING ON SPEAKING- BUT OUT OF THE HABIT IS TO SAY A FEW WORDS. I DO THINK IT IN WITH MY COLLEAGUES HERE- I THINK I'M THE ONE I NINE- A PARTISAN ON THIS- ON THIS DAY IN THIS COMMITTEE. BUT IT'S ALSO CLIMATE CHANGE HAS BEEN ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT- AFTER LOOKING AND STUDYING THE SCIENCES SOMETHING I'VE I'VE TAKEN UP- AND UNDERSTANDING THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS- THAT IS NOT JUST A REAL IT'S AND IT'S WITH THOSE PURSING IT EVERY SINGLE DAY. I THINK THE ONE FRUSTRATION FOR ME IS WHEN WE LOOK AT CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN A LEADER. IN THIS SPACE ARE CERTAINLY NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT GLOBALLY WE'VE BEEN WE'VE BEEN A LEADER. I STILL DON'T BELIEVE WE HAVE A VERY CLEAR ROADMAP ON WHAT IT IS THAT WE'RE GOING. TO DO WAS IT JUST. A REDUCING OUR CARBON EMISSIONS IS NOT ENOUGH WE HAVE TO GET TO A POINT. TO NOT ONLY A CARBON NEUTRAL ABOR ALSO CARBON NEGATIVE. THE QUESTION IS HOW DO WE GET THERE AND WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE WHAT'S THE ROAD MAP. FOR US TO FOLLOW AND THAT'S NOT CLEAR I EVEN STATE POLICY WE'VE DONE SOME AMAZING STATE POLICY. IN THIS SPACE BUT IT ISN'T VERY CLEAR VERY WELL THOUGHT OUT POLICY WE PICKED A LOT OF WINNERS AND LOSERS. AND YET BUT WE HAVEN'T DONE IS JUST DECIDED HERE'S WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO HERE IS THE ROADMAP FOR US TO BE ABLE TO GET YOU SO HOPEFULLY. WITH THIS COMMITTING AS WE BEGIN TO WORK- WITHIN BOTH HOUSES. AND NOT JUST THIS LEGISLATIVE SESSION BUT NEXT LEGISLATIVE SESSION. WE CAN PUT THAT TOGETHER. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH ASSEMBLY MEMBER JUST AS AN ASIDE. I DO HAVE A PLAN FOR THAT BUT WE CAN TALK ABOUT THAT. AND THEN THE LOCATION. I ALSO WANT TO WELCOME CENTER ALLEN- BUT- LIKE I JUST REPLY WITH IMMENSELY IMPORTANT TOPIC- I WAS. ALREADY PRETTY FIRED UP ABOUT THIS ISSUE I'VE GOT ALL THE MORE SO BY READING THAT IPCC REPORT MA'AM I'M CERTAINLY LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS DISCUSSION TODAY. THANK YOU SENATOR SO WITH THAT. OF THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD LIANE RANDOLPH- MADAM CHAIR WELCOME AND PLEASE BEGIN YOUR PRESENTATION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HAVING ME- I AM GOING TO BE SHARING FOR THE SLIGHTEST PART OF MY PRESENTATION- THIS IS THE- FIRST OPPORTUNITY I HAVE PRIDE YOU APPEAR BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE AND GIVE AN UPDATE ON OUR AB ONE NINETY SEVEN WORK SO I'M VERY PLEASED TO BE WITH YOU TODAY. ALRIGHT. OKAY SO FIRST I WANTED TO START- WITH AIR QUALITY. THAT CALIFORNIA HAS HAD REMARKABLE SUCCESSES IN TERMS OF- DEALING WITH OUR AIR QUALITY RESPONSIBILITIES BPA THAT HEALTH BASED STANDARDS AND IT'S REQUIRED BY FEDERAL LAW TO REGULARLY REVIEW THOSE STANDARDS TO ENSURE THAT THEIR HEALTH PROTECTIVE BASED ON THE LATEST SCIENCE AND INPUT FROM CARD. NOT OXIDES OF NITROGEN ARE ONE OF THE KEY SMOG FORMING POLLUTANTS WE CONTROL TO PREVENT OZONE. FORMATION AND THE CHART ON THE SLIDE SHOWS CALIFORNIA'S PROGRESS IN REDUCING NOT COMMISSION SINCE TWO THOUSAND. EMISSIONS HAVE BEEN STEADILY DECREASING SINCE THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES DUE TO MULTIPLE REGULATIONS OVER ADOPTED OVER TIME. AND THAT'S PROGRESS REALLY REFLECTS THE BENEFITS OF CARBONI PA PROGRAMS FOR MOBILE BIRTH IS AN AIR DISTRICT PROGRAMS FOR STATIONARY. MOBILE SEARCHES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE LARGEST SHARE OF NOT EMISSIONS REDUCTION DUE TO MORE STRINGENT ENGINE STANDARDS CLEANER FUEL AN INCENTIVE FUNDING. OUR GRAPH REFLECTS THESE BENEFITS. BECAUSE MOBILE SOURCES THEIR RESPONSIBLE 480% OF **** MISSION DANCE- STANDARDS. WIENER FEELS AN INCENTIVE FINDINGS HAVE BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR A LARGE PORTION OF THIS PROGRESS. FOR EXAMPLE EMISSIONS FROM A NEW CAR ARE 99% CLEANER THAN A CAR FROM THE EARLY NINETEEN SEVENTIES. AND AS YOU KNOW THE STANDARD SET HERE IN CALIFORNIA A COPY THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY AND THE WORLD. THAT PEOPLE WELL BEYOND OUR BORDERS BENEFIT FROM OUR LEADERSHIP. HARPER AND THE AIR DISTRICTS HAVE ALSO WORKED TO REDUCE RISK OF EXPOSURE TO AIR TOXICS FROM INDUSTRIAL SOURCES LIKE REFINERY. SMALLER SOURCES LIKE GAS STATIONS AND MOBILE SOURCES LIKE DIESEL TRUCKS. CALIFORNIA THEIR TACTICS PROGRAM BEGAN IN NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE WITH THE ADOPTION OF THE TOXIC AIR CONTAMINANT IDENTIFICATION AND CONTROL ACT. AND THE STATE HAS IDENTIFIED OVER TWO HUNDRED SUBSTANCES THAT ARE HAZARDOUS TO HEALTH. AND HAVE ADOPTED NUMEROUS REGULATIONS TO REDUCE EMISSIONS AND EXPOSURE TO THESE POLLUTANTS INCLUDING LIMITING THE LEVELS OF BENZENE IN GASOLINE AND PHASING OUT THE USE OF. CARCINOGENS FROM DRY CLEANERS BY TWENTY TWENTY THREE. THE STATE'S EFFORTS CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON REDUCING EMISSIONS OF DIESEL PARTICULATE WHICH ACCOUNT FOR ABOUT 70% OF THE TOTAL KNOWN CANCER RISK RELATED TO TOXIC AIR CONTAMINANT. THESE NUMBERS AND TRENDS ARE IMPRESSIVE. THE AIR IS CLEANER. THREE THIRTY THOUSAND PREMATURE DEATHS ARE AVOIDED EACH YEAR TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND ASTHMA CASES HAVE BEEN AVOIDED. ALL THE WHILE CALIFORNIA HAS GROWN TO BE THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD. BUT LET ME BE CLEAR THERE ISN'T MORE WORK AHEAD OF US. ACTION AT LEAST ONE THIRD OF CALIFORNIA'S THIRTY NINE POINT FIVE MILLION RESIDENTS STILL LIVE IN COMMUNITIES THAT EXCEED FEDERAL HEALTH PROTECTIVE STANDARD. EXPOSURE TO DIESEL PARTICULATE IS TOO HIGH ESPECIALLY IN COMMUNITIES NEAR FREIGHT FACILITIES AT THE PORT RASHGUARDS DISTRIBUTION CENTERS AND CLOSE TO FREEWAY. GRAPHIC SHOWS SOME OF THE PROGRESS WE'VE MADE SINCE EIGHTEEN THIRTY TWO WEST SIDE AND SINCE WE STARTED DISCUSSING PLAN PROCESS. IN TWO THOUSAND WE HAVE MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN REDUCING EMISSIONS PER CAPITA THIRTY EIGHTY P. AND IN TOTAL WHILE THE ECONOMY AND POPULATION CONTINUE TO GROW. THE PIE CHART SHOWS WHICH SECTORS CONTRIBUTE THE MOST TO OUR GHG EMISSIONS IN THE AB THIRTY TWO GHG INVENTORY. SB THAT 24% IS INDUSTRIAL AND APPROXIMATELY HALF OF THAT INDUSTRIAL SECTOR IS RELATED TO OIL AND GAS EXTRACTION AND REFINING. WHICH PUTS THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR AT ABOUT SO FOCUSING ON THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR IS CRITICAL. IN TWENTY NINETEEN CALIFORNIA'S GHG EMISSIONS WERE FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTEEN MILLION METRIC TONS OF CO TWO EQUIVALENT. TRANSPORTATION IS THE LARGEST ANTHROPOGENIC SOURCE OF CALIFORNIA GHG EMISSIONS. THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR IS ALSO THE DOMINANT SOURCE OF NITROGEN OXIDES ARE NOT EMISSIONS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO OZONE AND OUR PARTICULAR AIR QUALITY PROBLEMS AS I MENTIONED EARLIER. DOMINATED BY THE HEAVY TRANSPORTATION SEGMENT INCLUDING HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS BUSES READY TO QUIT MEANT LOCOMOTIVES. MARINE VESSEL. AND OTHER OFF ROAD EQUIPMENT ACCOUNTING FOR OVER 60% OF THE STATE'S NOT COMMISSION. IN ADDITION DIESEL PARTICULATE MATTER MAKES UP 30% OF ALL PARTICULATE MATTER EMISSIONS FROM THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR. UNLIKE THE OTHER PARTICULATE MATTER INCLUDED IN THE PIE GRAPHS DIESEL PM IS NOT A CRITERIA POLLUTANT BUT IT'S A TOXIC AIR CONTAMINANTS. SO LET'S PIVOT TO THE AB THIRTY TWO STEPPING PLAN AND THE WORK THAT LIES AHEAD. THE THIRTY PLANT ARE ACTIONABLE PLANS TO LAY OUT COST EFFECTIVE AND TECHNOLOGY FEASIBLE TECHNOLOGICALLY FEASIBLE PATH TO ENSURE THAT WE MEET THESE GHG REDUCTION TARGET. EACH CUTTING PLAN HAS INCLUDED A SUITE OF POLICIES AND HAVE NEVER RELIED ON JUST ONE APPROACH TO REDUCING EMISSIONS. THEY EACH HAVE A COMBINATION OF INCENTIVES REGULATIONS AND CARBON PRICING MECHANISMS. IMPORTANTLY THE PLAN IS ECONOMY WIDE AND SPANS MANY YEARS I THOUGHT IT COULD NOT GO INTO THE DESIGN DETAILS OF ANY PARTICULAR PROGRAM A REGULATION NORDIC AT THE PLANT OR CREATE NEW STATUTES AND REGULATIONS. THE FIRST STEPPING PLAN WAS RELEASED IN TWENTY THIRTEEN AND SUBSEQUENT UPDATES HAVE BEEN RELEASED AT LEAST ONCE EVERY FIVE YEARS. EVERY PREVIOUS SCOPING PLAN WAS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE GHG AND AIR POLLUTION EMISSIONS REDUCTION. WE ARE REQUIRED TO IN A- MINIMIZE LEAKAGE WHICH IS WHEN THE PRODUCTION OF GOODS AND JOBS LEAVES THE STATE. SO IT LOOKS LIKE WE REDUCED EMISSIONS BUT IN FACT THEY MERELY REMOVED WERE MOVED OUT OF OUR INVENTORY THAT WE NEED TO BE CAREFULLY ANALYZING LEAKAGE. FINALLY AB THIRTY TWO REQUIRES US TO FACILITATE SUBNATIONAL AND NATIONAL COLLABORATION. AND THAT POLICIES BECAUSE DEFECTIVE AND FLEXIBLE WITH COMPLIANCE. CLIMATE CHANGE IS A GLOBAL ISSUE AND WITHOUT ACTION FROM LIKE MINDED PARTNERS WE WILL STILL FACE THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE. OR GLOBAL POLLUTANTS SUCH AS GREENHOUSE GASES. A REDUCTION ANYWHERE IS A BENEFIT EVERYWHERE. OUR GOAL HAS ALWAYS BEEN TO DEVELOP SCALABLE AND EXPORTABLE PROGRAMS THAT OTHER JURISDICTIONS CAN USE TO IMPLEMENT AND REDUCE EMISSIONS WITHIN THEIR BORDERS. THE TWENTY TWENTY TO THE SCRAPPING PLAN WILL AFFECT PROGRESS TO ACHIEVING OUR TWENTY THIRTY TARGET AND IT WILL IT WILL EVALUATE HOW TO PUT OURSELVES ON A PATH THAT ULTIMATELY ACHIEVES CARBON NEUTRALITY. ONYX GRAPHICS YOU CAN SEE THE TWENTY THIRTY TARGET OF 40% BELOW NINETEEN NINETY LEVELS BY TWENTY THIRTY. IF WE ACHIEVE THAT TARGET AND MAINTAIN THAT RATE OF REDUCTION WE WOULD BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE 80% BELOW NINETEEN NINETY LEVELS BY TWENTY FORTY. THAT PUTS US IN A GOOD POSITION TO ACHIEVE CARBON NEUTRALITY BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE. TWENTY THIRTY IS A MILESTONE ON THE WAY TO ACHIEVING CARBON NEUTRALITY. THE LEVEL OF TRANCE FORMATION REQUIRED TO HIT CARBON NEUTRALITY BY MIDCENTURY MEANS THAT WE SHOULD PRIORITIZE ACTIONS IN TECHNOLOGIES THAT WILL NOT RESULT IN STRANDED ASSETS AFTER TWENTY THIRTY. AND THAT WE NEED TO BE THINKING ABOUT LONGER POLICY SIGNAL. TO ATTRACT PRIVATE CAPITAL FOR ACTION AND INVESTMENT IN CLEAN TECHNOLOGY. I LAUGHED AT THE PLAN ADOPTED IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN LAID OUT A PATH TO ACHIEVE THE TWENTY THIRTY TARGET A 40% BELOW NINETEEN NINETY. BUT INCLUDE ACTION ON EVERY SECTOR OF THE ECONOMY AND IDENTIFIED THE NEED FOR CLEAN ENERGY AND TECHNOLOGY. ALTERNATIVE MOBILITY OPTIONS. THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM AND SLASHING SHORT LIVED CLIMATE POLLUTANT. IMPORTANTLY IT HIGHLIGHTED THE NEED TO LEVERAGE OUR EXISTING AIR QUALITY PROGRAMS TO ACHIEVE OUR GHG TARGETS AND CONTINUE TO DRIVE DOWN HARMFUL AIR POLLUTION IN VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. IMPORTANTLY KEEP PROGRAMS SUCH AS THE RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD AND CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM. HAVE DOUBLED IN STRINGENCY AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS YEAR TO REFLECT A STEEPER RATE REDUCTIONS NEEDED TO ACHIEVE THE TWENTY THIRTY PACKAGE. SO THE HISTORICAL PERFORMANCE OF THESE PROGRAMS DOES NOT NECESSARILY REFLECT THE IMPACT THESE PROGRAMS WILL HAVE HUNDRED INCREASED DJINDJIC THE ESTABLISHED FOR THE SECOND. MINISTRATIONS THE LEGISLATURE AND STATE AGENCIES HAVE BEEN WORKING DILIGENTLY TO SEND STEADY POLICY SIGNALS THAT WE WANT TO REDUCE GHGS AND ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE. WE ARE NOW IN THE SECOND DECADE OF TACKLING CLIMATE CHANGE AND WE ARE SEEING OUTCOMES THAT WE HAD HOPED FOR. WE KNOW CLIMATE ACTION COULD CREATE AND KEEP HIRING JOBS SUCH AS IN OUR CLEAN TECH SECTORS. WE HAVE SEEN SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT AND INCREASED INVESTOR INTEREST IN CLEAN ENERGY AND CLEAN TECHNOLOGY. FOR EXAMPLE WE HAVE AT LEAST TWO REFINERIES DEVASTATED THEY WILL STOP PRODUCING CONVENTIONAL DIESEL AND INSTEAD PRODUCE RENEWABLE DIESEL. WHICH PRODUCES 30% LESS DIESEL PM. THEY CANCER CAUSING POLLUTANTS THAT CONCENTRATES NEAR FREEWAYS. BENEFITING HEAVILY BURDENED COMMUNITIES WHICH ARE OFTEN ADJACENT. SO I WANT TO DIGRESS FOR A MOMENT AND TALK ABOUT THE IMPORTANT ROLE OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN THIS WORK. MANY FACILITIES WE NEED TO MEET OUR CLIMATE GOALS SUCH AS RENEWABLE ENERGY FACILITIES IS NEARING MISSION VEHICLE CHARGING STATIONS. CONVERSIONS OF REFINERY CLEANER FUEL THAT THEY MENTION. COMPOSTING FACILITIES WHICH ARE ESSENTIAL TO REDUCING EMISSIONS FOR ORGANIC WASTE. ARE ALL SUBJECT TO LOCAL PERMITTING AND SITING REQUIREMENTS. IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TAKE THE URGENCY OF ADDRESSING CLIMATE CHANGE INTO ACCOUNT AS THEY ARE REVIEWING THESE LAND USE ISSUES. ACHIEVING SUCCESS ON CLIMATE CHANGE MEANS THAT WE NEED TO REMOVE OBSTACLES FOR THE CLEAN TRANSITION OF EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE. OR BUILD OUT OF NEW CLEAN ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE AND RECOGNIZE THE EXECUTION OF THE SCOPING PLAN. REALLY DOES RELY ON A STORY AT BOTH THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVEL. WE KICKED OFF THE TWENTY TWENTY TO SCOPING PLAN WITH A SERIES OF WORKSHOPS IN JUNE. AND THE PLAN WILL BE CONSIDERED BY THE BOARD IN LATE TWENTY TWENTY TWO. IT DOES DIFFER FROM THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN STEPPING PLAN IN CONTENT AND PURPOSE. ANY THIRTY TARGETED IN STATUTE AND WE MUST REDUCE GHG EMISSIONS BY AT LEAST 40% FROM NINETEEN NINETY LEVELS BY TWENTY THIRTY BY LAW. BUT WE WILL BE ASSESSING PROGRESS TOWARDS ACHIEVING THAT TARGET. WE ALSO RECOGNIZE AS I MENTIONED EARLIER THAT TWENTY THIRTY IS A MILE DOWN ON WHERE RECENT GIANT SAYS WE NEED TO BE BY MID CENTURY. SO WE CAN'T WAIT UNTIL TWENTY THIRTY ONE TO START PLANNING FOR TWENTY FORTY FIVE. BECAUSE THE LEVEL OF TRANSFORMATION NEEDED ACROSS THE ECONOMY IS UNPRECEDENTED SO WE NEED TO START PLANNING FOR THAT NOW. WHICH MEANS LOOKING FOR ACTION TO DEPLOY CLEAN ENERGY AND CLEAN TECH HIT THE TWENTY THIRTY TARGET AND PUT US ON THE PATH TO THE TWENTY FOUR FORTY FIVE TARGET. CAN'T THE COUPLE THE TWO. IT LOOKS OUT OVER TWENTY YEARS THIS COPING PLAN WILL HAVE THE LONGEST PLANNING HORIZON OF ANY PREVIOUS VERSION. BUT AS NOTED EARLIER WE ARE ALSO WE VALUE IT IN A PATH TO ACHIEVE CARBON NEUTRALITY BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE HER DIRECTION FROM GOVERNOR NEWSOM. MEANS THAT WE WILL PLACE A LARGER FOCUS ON OUTCOMES WE NEED TO ACHIEVE BY THAT TIME. IN IDENTIFYING OUTCOME THE MODELING WILL PROVIDE PASSED FOR CLEAN TECHNOLOGY AND ENERGY DEPLOYMENT. FOR EXAMPLE THE RATE OF SALES OF LIGHT DUTY ELECTRIC VEHICLE OR ELECTRIC APPLIANCES. METRICS IN ADDITION TO THE ANNUAL GHG INVENTORY CAN HELP US TRACK PROGRESS MOVING FORWARD. IMPORTANTLY THESE OUTCOMES MUST BE CONSIDERED BOTH IN THE CONTEXT OF ACHIEVING NEAR TERM AIR QUALITY BENEFITS AND LONGER TERM GREENHOUSE GAS BENEFITS. THE COPING PLAN UPDATE WILL ALSO REQUIRE US TO REDEFINE OUR SCOPE OF SOURCES AND THINK IN THE FRAMEWORK OF CARBON NEUTRALITY. THAT PROTECTS CONFIDENTIALITY IS ACHIEVED REMISSION SOURCES EQUAL THANK. UP UNTIL NOW EVERY SCOPING PLAN AS MENTIONED EARLIER HAS FOCUSED ON REDUCING EMISSIONS FROM THE SOURCES DEFINED IN AB THIRTY TWO INVENTORY WHICH FOCUSES ON FOSSIL ENERGY AND INDUSTRIAL FORCES. AND WE DO HAVE A SEPARATE INVENTORY FOR NATURAL AND WORKING LANDS. BUT AS WE SHIFTED A FRAMEWORK OF CARBON NEUTRALITY WE WILL EXPAND THE SCOPE TO INCLUDE ALL SOURCES WHICH MEANS THE EMISSIONS FROM NATURAL THE WORKING LAND AT ALL THINK. WHICH CAN BE NATURAL AND WORKING LANDS CARBON CAPTURE AND SEQUESTRATION FOR LARGE EMITTERS DIRECT AIR CAPTURE AND PERMANENT STORAGE OF CO TWO FROM THE ATMOSPHERE. THE PATHWAY TO CARBON NEUTRALITY STUDY DEVELOPED FOR CARP BY ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL ECONOMICS EXAMINES THREE BROAD PATHWAYS. TO ACHIEVING CARBON NEUTRALITY. EACH PATHWAY CHARTED THE SAME PATH 280% OF REDUCTIONS THEN CHARTED DIFFERENT PATHWAYS AFTER. ONE SCENARIO MADE USE OF EXPANDED CARBON DIOXIDE REMOVAL STRATEGIES ANOTHER ACHIEVED ZERO FOSSIL FUEL EMISSIONS BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE AND THE THIRD SCENARIO WOULD HAVE BEEN A BLENDING OF THE TWO. WATER ZERO CARBON ENERGY SCENARIO ACHIEVED IN 92% REDUCTION IN GREENHOUSE GASES BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE. THE IDEAL BALANCE OF REDUCTIONS PURSUE COVERING NOUVEAU REMOVAL STRATEGIES IS NOT YET NOW. ENTER THIS PROCESS WITH AN OPEN MIND ON EVALUATING STRATEGIES. BUT AS THE SCALE OF THE CRISIS BECOMES CLEARER IT IS BECOMING VERY APPARENT THAT WE NEEDED NOT ONLY THINK ABOUT REDUCING EMISSIONS BUT ALSO WAYS THAT WE CAN ACTIVELY REMOVE GREENHOUSE GASES FROM THE ATMOSPHERE. THERE WILL BE SOME CHANGES TO THE DATA AND METRICS FOR THE SCOPING PLAN. AS REQUIRED UNDER EIGHTY ONE NINETY SEVEN WE WILL BE INCLUDING THE COST PER TON OF POLICY. THE SOCIAL COST OF CARBON. AN ESTIMATED AIR QUALITY BENEFITS. WE DO BELIEVE THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION WILL HAVE UPDATED SOCIAL COST OF CARBON VALUES THAT ARE PROJECTED TO BE HIGHER THAN THE OBAMA ERA VALUES THAT WE USED IN THE LAST PLAN THAT WE WILL INCORPORATE THAT INTO OUR WORK. AND I WORK WITH THE C. E. C. AND B. PC FOR THE F. B. ONE HUNDRED REPORT. CARD INCLUDED AN UPDATED APPROACH TO THE HEALTH ANALYSIS. WE WILL BUILD OFF WHAT WE DID IN ALASKA BEEN PLAN AND THE SB ONE HUNDRED REPORT TO INCLUDE NEW HEALTH AND POINTS AND INCLUDE THE ECONOMIC IMPACTS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS NEW AND POINTS. AND WILL BE HAVING WORKSHOPS ON THAT LATER THIS YEAR. WE WILL DO A PUBLIC HEALTH ANALYSIS. AND OF COURSE WE WILL DO IS HE QUITE ANALYSIS. UNDER LEGAL REQUIREMENTS WE HAD TO OFFICIALLY STATE THE START OF THE SECRET ADMINISTRATIVE RECORD AND WE CHOSE MID JANUARY AS POSTED TO OUR WEBSITE. WHICH IS WHEN WE GOT STARTED- WORKING ON CONVENING KEY ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ADVISORY COMMITTEE. AND NOTIFYING OUR LEGAL OFFICE THAT WE WOULD NEED- CONTRACTOR HELP YOU TO SEE WHAT WORK. IN CLOSING AND THEY MENTIONED AB THIRTY TWO REQUIRES THAT THE CRAPPY PLAN BE UPDATED EVERY FIVE YEARS SO WE WILL NEED TO BRING THE PLAN BEFORE THE CARDBOARD FOR ADOPTION BY THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY Q. THE TIMELINE HERE DEPICTS MAJOR MILESTONES WERE PLANNING TO MEET THAT- DEADLINE. THERE WILL BE AMPLE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE PUBLIC TO ENGAGE THROUGH UPCOMING WORKSHOPS. THE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ADVISORY COMMITTEE MEETINGS AND FOR COMMUNITY MEETINGS THAT WILL OCCUR- IN THE FALL AND ON GOING THROUGH NEXT YEAR. AT THE WHITE SHOWS THAT WE PLAN TO READ RELEASED THE DRAFT CAPPING PLAN- AND PRESENT TO THE BOARD AND SPRING- AND THEY'LL BE ADDITIONAL ENGAGEMENT BETWEEN THE DRAFT AND THE FINAL LATER IN THE YEAR. WELL I JUST DETAILS THE REPORTING AND OVERSIGHT THAT EXIST FOR CARDS PROGRAM IN THE PROGRAMS INCLUDING OUR ANNUAL UPDATES TO OUR GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY AND MANDATORY REPORTING. STATUS UPDATES ETCETERA. AND I WILL BE PROVIDING THIS TO THE COMMITTEE. HOWEVER OUTSIDE OF OFFICIAL REPORTS AND OUR ROBUST PUBLIC PROCESS I WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH EACH OF YOU IN THE COMING YEARS AS WE STRIVE TO ACHIEVE OUR GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION GOALS. AND TO REDUCE THE BURDEN OF AIR POLLUTION ON ALL CALIFORNIANS ARE PARTICULARLY THOSE MOST IMPACTED. AS WAS DISCUSSED AT THE OUTSET OF THE HEARING WE CANNOT UNDERSTATE HOW SIGNIFICANT THE CHALLENGES AHEAD ARE. ACHIEVING CARBON NEUTRALITY REQUIRES A NEARLY COMPLETE TRANSFORMATION OF CALIFORNIA FROM A STATE STILL HEAVILY DEPENDENT ON FOSSIL FUELS. WE DO EVERYTHING FROM GET TO WORK THE LIGHTER HOME. IT WAS STATE WHERE ALMOST EVERYTHNG WE CAN DO IF POWERED BY RENEWABLE ENERGY. WE NEED A MASSIVE EXPANSION OF CLEAN PUBLIC TRANSIT WE NEED CHANGES IN HOW WE DESIGN OUR BUILT ENVIRONMENT. WE NEED COULD UNDO POLICIES AND INCENTIVES THAT FAVOUR SPRAWL. WILL NEED TO EXPAND OUR REGIONAL PARTNERSHIPS. COORDINATE WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. AND COLLABORATE WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO ACHIEVE NATIONAL CLIMATE SOLUTIONS THAT BUILD ON OUR PIONEERING WORK HERE IN CALIFORNIA. WITH THE NEW FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO NOT ONLY EXPORT. OUR POLICIES NATIONALLY BUT ALSO WORK TO ACHIEVE REDUCTIONS PROTECTORS WE CURRENTLY CAN'T REGULATE SUCH AS AVIATION AND THE RAIL SECTOR. I THANK GOD THE IPCC JUST RELEASED A STUDY SHOWING THAT RECENT CHANGES IN OUR CLIMATE- WIDESPREAD RAPID AND INTENSIFYING. ACHIEVING NET ZERO IF NECESSARY. YET THIS IS AN ALL HANDS ON DECK MOMENT THAT REQUIRES OLD COMMITTED LEADERSHIP. THE TIME FOR QUIBBLING OVER DEFINITELY MANISHA OR AGONIZING OVER DEMAND IN A SPENDING CHANGES AS LONG PASSED. BUT AFTER THAT FIRE NO ONE WORRIES THAT THERE ARE TOO MANY FIRE TRUCKS. ALL THAT MATTERS IS PUTTING OUT THE FIRE. IT'S TIME FOR US TO BE THINKING ABOUT THE CLIMATE CRISIS THE SAME WAY AND TO FOCUS ON BOTH PLANS AND ACTION AT ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT. THE TASK IS DAUNTING BUT I HAVE FAITH WITH THE HEART IN THE HARD WORK AND DEDICATION OF OUR STAFF WITH THE AMBITION OF GREEN ENTREPRENEURS AND THE VISION OF THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE WE CAN MEET THE CHALLENGE AND CREATE A HEALTHIER AND MORE EQUITABLE CALIFORNIA FOR ALL. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT BEFORE THE COMMITTEE AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO ANSWERING YOUR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE CHAIR RANDOLPH I LIKE. TO SEE IF- ANY MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. WOULD LIKE TO START WITH QUESTIONS FOR THE CHAIR. ASSEMBLY MEMBER. THE MANAGER THAT WAS A FANTASTIC PRESENTATION ON A THANK YOU FOR THAT- BECAUSE YOU ARE BEING- VERY REAL- IN YOUR IN YOUR ANALYSIS SO- AGAIN WANNA I DON'T WANT TO THANK YOU- IT JUST THAT THE QUESTION THAT REALLY THAT I HAVE IS KNOWING WHERE WE'RE AT TODAY EVEN WITH THE RECENT- IPCC REPORT- AND HOW DIRE SITUATION IS. CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHETHER CURRENT STATE POLICY. NOT A WEATHER WE'VE MAXIMIZED. EFFICIENCY WITH MAXIMIZED DOLLARS THAT ARE BEING COLLECTED WHETHER WE'VE MAXIMIZE THE THAT THE POLICIES THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE TODAY HAVE WE USED THOSE POLICIES IN THOSE DOLLARS TO BE ABLE TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS TO. THE GREATEST EXTENT. WE HAVE A LOT MORE TO DO- I THINK IT MET WE HAVE BEEN VERY EFFECTIVE IN- IN REDUCING GREENHOUSE GASES UP TO THIS POINT- AND WE HAVE ACHIEVED SOME SUCCESSES BUT THE REALITY IS IT'S NOT ENOUGH AND IT'S NOT FAST ENOUGH- AS I MENTIONED THERE'S MANY DIFFERENT IMPLEMENTATION- STRATEGIES THAT WE NEED TO LEAN INTO- AND WE NEED TO DEPLOY ALL OF THE- INCENTIVES THAT. THE REGULAR START REGULATORY STAT- AND THE MARKET MECHANISMS THAT WE CAN TO GET WHERE WE NEED TO GO- I THANK YOU. YOU KNOW I'LL GIVE A SMALL EXAMPLE- ONE OF THE CHALLENGES AROUND- INCENTIVE PROGRAM IS SORT OF THIS KIND OF THE STOP AND START NATURE OF THEM YOU KNOW WE'LL HAVE FUNDING AND THEN IT'LL RUN OUT AND THEN WE'LL GET MORE SPENDING OR- WILL RECONSTRUCT THE PROGRAM. AND I THINK IT'S IT CAN BE CHALLENGING- AND SO- THAT'S JUST ONE SMALL EXAMPLE OF. AREAS WHERE WE CAN REALLY LEAN AND- ANOTHER EXAMPLE AS I MENTIONED WAS- THINKING ABOUT THE ROLE OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS- AND- THEIR STRATEGIES AROUND. LAND USE AND REDUCING VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED AND INCITING- RENEWABLE ENERGY FACILITIES THINGS LIKE THAT SO WE REALLY ALL NEED TO BE WORKING TOGETHER AT THE STATE- AS HARD AND AS FAST AS WE POSSIBLY CAN. WELL THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THAT- AND I GUESS PART OF THIS AND YOU BROUGHT UP VEHICLES MOUNT THE VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED WHICH IS A SORE SUBJECT FOR AREAS LIKE MINE IN THE INLAND BUILDING A MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING OR HOUSING THAT'S MORE AFFORDABLE THAN IT IS IN. IN ORANGE COUNTY AND LA AND YET WE'VE GOT POLICIES LIKE V. M. T. THAT HAVE SAID ALWAYS WE'RE NOT GONNA WE'RE NOT GONNA LIE TO BE ABLE TO BUILD ANYMORE ROAD SO THERE'S MORE TRANSPORTATION ISSUES I WANT TO GET GO DOWN THAT ROAD. THE REASON PART OF THE REASON I'M ASKING THIS QUESTION IS THAT I THINK ABOUT HOW WE'RE SPENDING MONEY WITH THEM WITHIN THE G. G. R. F. FUND- AND I CAN TELL YOU. A FOR ME A FEW YEARS AGO I WE SPENT A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OR MORE ON WATER- WHICH BY THE WAY IS. SUPER NEEDED WE KNOW NOW WE'RE IN A IN A DROUGHT. AND YET I THOUGHT THAT THE REASON THAT WE USED TO THE G. R. F. DOLLARS WERE SUPPOSED TO BE USED TOWARD REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND SO. IT SEEMS AS THOUGH ON ONE SIDE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A POLICIES. THAT THAT WERE SAYING THAT WERE TALK ABOUT THIS OVERALL. PLAN THAT WE'VE GOT TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AT THE WORLD IS. AS FUN AS THIS ACCESS TO THREAT BEFORE A- BUT TO BE VERY REAL- OUR POLICIES AND OUR EXPENDITURES. DON'T ALIGN WITH THAT AND SO AGAIN I WANT TO GO BACK TO THANKING YOU FOR. YOUR PRESENTATION BECAUSE I THINK YOU MADE THAT YOU MADE THAT VERY CLEAR IN YOUR COMMENTS- BY THE WAY ARE. ARE VERY DIPLOMATIC IN RESPONSE VERY DIPLOMATIC AS WELL SO THANK YOU WHAT. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER SET OF EYES CHAU BAKER. THANK YOU I THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR COMMENTS AND THAT SUPER INFORMATIVE PRESENTATION REALLY APPRECIATE THAT. I'M JUST SORT OF WHAT I GUESS SIR ONE COMMENT AND WHEN ONE QUESTION YOU YOU DID MENTION CAP AND TRADE AND KNOW THAT THAT DOES PLAN IMPORTANT ROLE IN ME THE TWENTY THIRTY TARGETS AND I'VE APPROVAL EXPRESSED MY- INTEREST BELIEVE THAT WE NEED A STRONG. MARKET A SIGNAL THERE- SO IF YOU ANY ANY ANY COMMENTS ON THAT- BUT- THE IMMEDIATE QUESTION IS. HAVE YOU RUN A BUSINESS YOU KNOW WE PUT TOGETHER FINANCIAL TARGETS WE USUALLY DON'T IF I SET UP ACTIONS WE BELIEVE CAN OVER ACHIEVE THE TARGETS KNOWING THAT EVERYTHING IS NOT GOING TO GO ACCORDING TO PLAN. SO YOU WANT TO KNOW THAT WE CAN HIT THE TARGET WITH CONSERVATIVES OPTIONS. I'M AND THERE FOR HAVE A GOOD CHANCE EXCEEDING THE TARGETS ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT A CLIMATE PLAN THIS WAY IN THE SCOPING PLAN AND- PRINTED PLANT. TO GET A PLANTS WILL CONSERVATIVELY HIT THE TARGETS THAT WILL POTENTIALLY OVERACHIEVE. IF THINGS GO WELL OR WE RISK THAT IF ANY OF THESE POLICIES DON'T GO AS PREDICTED THAT WE WILL MISS OUR- OUR TARGETS. NAY ALLEN. I GUESS I WOULD SAY A COUPLE THINGS- DEAN THE PURPOSE OF THE SCOPING PLAN IS. REALLY TO KIND OF LAY OUT THAT STRATEGY AND LOOKING AT DIFFERENT- TIME FRAMES LIKE. LOOKING AND TO TWENTY THIRTY FIVE FOR CARBON NEUTRALITY AS WELL AS TWENTY FORTY FIVE. WILL REALLY GIVE US THE OPPORTUNITY TO THINK ABOUT. WAYS THAT WE CAN MOVE FASTER IN IN DIFFERENT AREAS- AND FULLY ANALYZING HOW MUCH. EACH OF OUR PROGRAMS WE ANTICIPATE TO ACHIEVE THE REDUCTIONS THAT WE NEED- WE WERE FORTUNATE WE REACHED OUR TWENTY TWENTY GOALS A SENIOR THAN WE THOUGHT- SO I THINK WE HAVE- EFFECTIVELY LAID OUT STRATEGIES THAT HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO- CAN MOVE. MORE QUICKLY- AND THAT'LL BE SOMETHING THAT WE WILL BE- ANALYZING IN THE SKIPPING PLANET. THANK YOU. I DON'T SKINNER I'M CHAIR AND OFF YOU MENTIONED THAT THE- SCENARIO THE- REPORT THAT YOU RECEIVED THE SCENARIOS THAT GAVE THE SAY IT WELL IN FACT HAD THE SAME MEASURES FOR REACHING 80% BUT THEN THE 20% WERE DIFFERENT OPTIONS- AND IT I THINK IF I HEARD IT RIGHT BUT I MAY HAVE NOT HEARD CORRECTLY THE ONLY ONE OF THE THREE OPTIONS WAS A MORE FOCUSED ON THE CAPTURING AND SEQUESTERING OF CARBON. IS THAT ACCURATE. RIGHT RIGHT SO ONE LEANED INTO AND THAT HE NEEDED TO THAT OF THE STRATEGY I'M ALONE I'M JUST DOUBLE CHECKING MY NOTES I WANT TO MAKE SURE I'M NOT GIVING YOU THEIR- INFORMATION- AND THEN THE- AT ONES THAT ARE YELLOW. AT LEANED HEAVILY INTO THAT REMOVAL STRATEGIES WHILE THE OTHER SCENARIO- LEANED INTO AT JERRY WE MISSION SO OKAY OKAY THING MORE ON REDUCING EMISSIONS AND THEN THE THIRD SCENARIO DID A COMBINATION OF COMBO OKAY. SO OF THE 80% HOW MUCH WAS REMOVAL FACTORED IN IN JUST GETTING TO THE 80% WAS IT. OR WAS IT PRIMARILY ARMS REDUCTION IT WAS PRIMARILY IN THIS INTRODUCTION OKAY- AND THERE ARE THESE THE ONLY SCENARIOS THE BOARD IS GOING TO LOOK AT THE REASON I RAISE IT- YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW. OKAY GO AHEAD. YEAH I THOUGHT SORRY TO INTERRUPT BUT I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU KNOW THE DANCE THAT WAS THE CARBON NEUTRALITY STUDY THAT WAS DONE BY E THREE- AND WE WILL BE LOOKING AT A MUCH BROADER SUITE OF POSSIBLE SCENARIOS. IN THE SCOPING PLAN OKAY- AND THE REASON I REASON AND I DON'T I MEAN OBVIOUSLY I. I DO WANT TO ASK QUESTIONS AND HAVE THE ANSWERS BUT I'LL AND I DON'T WANT TO JUST BE SETTING UP QUESTIONS FOR LEADING LEADING YOU TO I'M- GOING TO EXPRESS THE OPINION THAT I THINK THAT. WE- THAT WE NEED TO HAVE REMOVAL EVEN IN OUR 80% AND THAT AND I DON'T MEAN I IN NO WAY WANT TO DIMINISH. THE EMISSIONS REDUCTION SO I AM NOT ADVOCATING THAT WE MOVE AWAY FROM THAT EMPHASIS I'M ONLY ALSO ADVOCATING. THAT WE AT WE CONCURRENTLY PUT AS MUCH EMPHASIS ON THE REMOVAL GIVEN WHERE WE'RE AT RIGHT NOW. ABSOLUTELY I COMPLETELY AGREE I MEAN I THINK ONE OF THE KEY STRATEGIES FOR THIS ROUND OF THE SCOPING PLAN IS REALLY- IT DIVING INTO WHAT ARE THE OPPORTUNITIES AND NATURALLY WORKING LAND AND THEN WHAT OUR TECHNOLOGICAL OPPORTUNITIES- BUT BY NO MEANS ARE WE GOING TO I'M NOT ALSO CONSIDER- THE EMISSIONS REDUCTION SO. I THINK WE ARE IN COMPLETE ALIGNMENT ON AND REALLY MAKE REALLY UNDERSTANDING WAYS THAT WE CAN REMOVE CARBON- AS WE TRY TO YOU KNOW. ADDRESS THAT CRISIS. THANK YOU. FOLLOWING CENTER SCANNERS- QUESTIONS REGARDING THE IMPORTANCE OF CARBON REMOVAL- TECHNOLOGIES I- I'M REFERRING CHAIR AROUND OFF- TO. A COPY OF THE- THE PATHWAYS STUDY THAT I BELIEVE YOU'RE REFERRING TO THAT THE- WE'RE EXPLORING THAT THE THREE- POTENTIAL. BROAD PATHWAYS IN ACHIEVING CARBON NEUTRALITY BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE ARM. AND IN THE EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF THE R. PATHWAY STUDY- IT TALKS ABOUT HOW. WHILE THE- THIS IS ANDERSON ERROR RESULTS IN THE EXECUTIVE SUMMARY UNDER THE HIGH. CARBON DIOXIDE REMOVAL SCENARIO THAT- THAT THIS SCENARIO RELIES ON QUOTE RELATIVELY UNTESTED CARBON DIOXIDE REMOVAL STRATEGIES- WHICH ARE NOT WIDELY COMMERCIALIZED. COULD YOU- ASCHE SHARE YOUR OPINION IN TERMS OF. YOU KNOW WHAT IS. THE- WHAT WHAT WHERE WE ADD IN TERMS OF THE- THE- THE RELIABILITY AND THE- THE TESTED THE NATURE OF THE OF THESE TECHNOLOGIES I MEAN I MY QUESTION IS REALLY TRYING TO GET A GET OUT WHETHER WE ARE YOU KNOW WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE PUT OUR EGGS IN THE BASKET OF REAL TECHNOLOGY THAT ACHIEVE REAL. REDUCTIONS. WHETHER IN- CAPTURING CARBON BEFORE RELEASED OR WHETHER AND REMOVING. CARBON THROUGH THE SINKS CAN CAN YOU GIVE US. A SENSE OF- SOME OF THE STATE OF THE CARBON- REMOVAL A TECHNOLOGY AS IT CURRENTLY STANDS. YES ABSOLUTELY- WE RECENTLY HAD A- WORKSHOP ON THIS TOPIC WHERE WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS SOME OF THE KEY POLICY ISSUES AROUND- CARBON CAPTURE AND REMOVAL AND THEN ALSO HAD. SOME PRESENTATIONS ABOUT DIFFERENT- PROJECTS THAT EXIST- AND I GUESS I WOULD SORT OF JAM IT UP BY SAYING IT'S EARLY DAYS- THERE ARE AND THERE ARE STRATEGIES THAT ARE- THAT HAVE BEEN DEPLOYED- BUT THERE'S STILL A LOT OF. QUESTIONS ABOUT AND F WE'RE THINKING ABOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HOW EXACTLY AT THESE PROJECTS TO BE DEPLOYED WHAT TYPES OF- WHAT THE DIFFERENT. OPTIONS ARE AND WHAT SOME OF THE CONCERNS ARE I'M THINKING ABOUT- AIR QUALITY ISSUES ARE THINKING ABOUT- PERMANENCY AS RUDE AS IT RELATES TO SEE FRUSTRATION AND NEITHER ARE REALLY IMPORTANT KEY THINGS THAT NEED TO BE DISCUSSED- AS PART OF THE SCOPING PLAN PROCESS- SO THAT WE CAN UNDERSTAND- HOW WE CHARACTERIZE IT AND HOW WE THINK ABOUT IT AND IN THE CONTEXT OF THE SUITE OF STRATEGIES- AS I'VE AS I MENTIONED EARLIER AND I SAY ALL THE TIME- THIS IS REALLY THIS IS NOT AN EITHER OR KIND OF. MOMENT DIFFER THEY LET'S SEE BUT- HE WAS MUCH AS WE CAN AND UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING TO BE THE MOST EFFECTIVE- AND SO THAT'S A LOT OF WHAT THE. WORKING THE SKIPPING PLAN IS GOING TO BE ABOUT. YES I AND I CERTAINLY. YOUR CALL FOR BOLD ACTION WERE. AND THIS IS NOT A TIME TO BE QUIBBLING ABOUT TO. ABOUT YOU KNOW- SMALL DIFFERENCES- IN THAT THAT WE MAY HAVE FIGHT I HEAR THERE BUT I THINK THE POINT THAT TO ALL OF US- YOU KNOW WANT TO MAKE AT. WHAT WHAT WANT TO GET ADDED WE IS. YOU KNOW WE SEE WE SEE THE- THE END OF THE GRASS THAT YOU PRESENTED- AND YEAH WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ACHIEVING. IN A REAL PROGRESS TOWARD- GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS AS WELL AS- REAL PROGRESS TOWARD ACHIEVING CARBON NEUTRALITY WORLD THE SCIENTISTS ALL AROUND THE WORLD- THAT- YOU KNOW HAVE CLEARLY STATED THAT WE NEED TO. OUR REACH- YOU KNOW IF NOT BY MID CENTURY- MUCH MUCH SOONER AS AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE SO GOING GOING BACK TO THAT THAT THE BIGGER POINT YOU KNOW THE ONE OF YOUR- CHARTS WAS.HAD THAT THAT MAPPED OUT- THE R. R. CALIFORNIA'S PROGRESS TOWARD OUR TWENTY THIRTY GOAL I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE. YOU KNOW HOW YOU ARE. YOU KNOW FOCUSED ON THE IMMEDIATE STATUTORY GOAL OF S. SB THIRTY TWO- THE 40% REDUCTION OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS COMPARED TO NINETEEN NINETY LEVELS BY TWENTY THIRTY. ARE WE ON TRACK TO ACHIEVE- THE TWENTY THIRTY GO UNDER SB THIRTY TWO- YES I BELIEVE WE ARE- I MEAN. HELPING PLAN IS GOING TO BE AFFECTING THAT- BUT WE HAVE BEEN ACHIEVING REDUCTIONS WE'VE ACHIEVED REDUCTIONS AHEAD OF SCHEDULE AND IMPORTANTLY OUR PROGRAMS ARE GETTING MORE STRINGENT- YOU KNOW STARTING THIS YEAR WE HAD. WE HAD- MODIFICATION TO THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM TO MAKE IT MORE STRINGENT- WE ALSO HAVE THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER WHICH WE ARE IMPLEMENTING IN THE TRANSPORTATION- AS HEARING MISSION SPACE THAT WE HAVE- REGULATORY WORK AROUND THAT. AND ALL OF THOSE MORE STRINGENT- STRATEGIES- I THINK WE'LL SHOW AS WE GOT TO DISCUSSING PLAN PROCESS THAT WE CAN MAKE IT TO OUR TWENTY THIRTY CALL. AND AND I AND I THINK THAT'S WHY YOUR- DIRECTION AND GUIDANCE IS GOING TO BE SO IMPORTANT IN THIS WORK- THINKING ABOUT HOW THE LEGISLATURE VIEWS- THE DIFFERENT STRATEGIES THE INCENTIVES- AND HOW ALL THAT PLAYS TOGETHER. IT'S GOING TO BE REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT. THANK YOU ARE. ON THE POINT OF YOU KNOW V. D. THE BALANCE BETWEEN THE DIRECT EMISSION REDUCTIONS VERSES THE- RELIANCE ON. CARBON CAPTURE AND SEQUESTRATION TECHNOLOGIES AS WELL AS NATURAL- SOLUTIONS- IF EFFORT FIRST FALL EVERITT WHICH WHICH YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT- THAT THERE ARE CO BENEFITS TO THE EMPHASIS ON THE DIRECT EMISSION REDUCTIONS NAMELY THE ODD AND NOT JUST IT SHAVING THE CARBON NEUTRALITY GOALS NOT JUST IN ITS EVEN THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION GOALS BUT ALSO THE- ACHIEVING THE AIR POLLUTION REDUCTIONS IN. THE AND OUR FRONT LINE COMMUNITIES WITH AN EMPHASIS ON THE DIRECT EMISSION REDUCTIONS. YES I MEAN I THINK THAT I THINK WE KNOW THAT- AB ONE NINETY SEVEN YOU KNOW REQUIRES US TO BE- MEANING INTO THOSE DIRECT- EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS AND- AND WE HAVE MANY STRATEGIES THAT CAN ACHIEVE BOTH AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT A LOT OF THE WORK- REGARDING DIRECT EMISSIONS HAVE NOT STOPPED AT THE AIR DISTRICT LEVEL- A COUPLE OF RECENT EXAMPLES WHERE THE SOUTH COAST AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT'S INDIRECT SOURCE ROLE- AROUND THEIR HOUSES AND THEN THE BAY AREA AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT. RECENTLY ADOPTED A NEW ROLE REGARDING REFINERY OPERATIONS SO THAT WORK CONTINUES- AND- AND AS YOU MENTIONED THERE ARE THEY GHG STRATEGIES HAVE BENEFITS AS RELATES TO AIR QUALITY IN THE AIR QUALITY STRETCH IDEAS HAVE BENEFITS. AS RELATE QGA GMS AND- ALL RIGHT. YOU TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT- SOME OF THE CONSIDERATIONS THEY THAT THE PLANS THAT- ARE TAKING PLACE AS PART OF THE TWENTY TWENTY TO SCOPING PLAN FOR PLANNING FOR THESE THESE THESE ESSENTIALLY- YOU KNOW. AND DO ALL- EXECUTIVE ORDERS- YOU GOVERNOR BROWN'S EXECUTIVE ORDER- TO ACHIEVE CARBON NEUTRALITY BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE- AND MORE RECENTLY GOVERNOR NEWSOM'S EXECUTIVE ORDER- CALLING UPON THE AIR B. TO EXPLORE. AFTER WAYS FOR ACHIEVING CARBON NEUTRALITY BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE- IT ARE ARE ARE ARE THERE ANY. TRADEOFFS ARE ARE THERE ANY DOWNSIDES. TO EXPLORING- A- A SHORTER TIMELINE TO TWENTY THIRTY FIVE- TIMELINE. I GUESS THE WAY I WOULD ARTICULATED IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT A TWENTY THIRTY FIVE GOAL YOU'RE REALLY THINKING ABOUT- IN RELATIVELY SHORT TIME FRAME INTO YOU'RE REALLY THINKING ABOUT THE TECHNOLOGIES THAT WE ALREADY HAVE THAT ARE EITHER. YOU KNOW IN THE MARKET OR ARE ABOUT TO- REACH MARKET- AND REACH MORE WIDESPREAD ADOPTION. IF YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT TWENTY FORTY FIVE- YOU YOU KNOW THERE'S SOME FLEXIBILITY AND THINKING ABOUT OKAY WHAT WHAT MIGHT THE FUTURE HOLD- WHAT MIGHT WE SEE IN TERMS OF- NEW TYPES OF BATTERIES FOR INSTANCE YOU KNOW WILL THERE BE AN OPPORTUNITY TO MOVE BEYOND LITHIUM ION YOU KNOW. HOW ARE WE THINKING ABOUT ARE THERE GOING TO BE ANY- AT. ANY ENERGY STRATEGIES THAT WE DON'T YET HAVE RIGHT NOW THAT WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO DEPLOY- SO I THINK AS AS YOU LOOK AT THE- THE DIFFERENT TIME FRAMES- WHEN YOU CAN GET ABOUT TWENTY THIRTY FIVE YOU'RE REALLY THINKING ABOUT OKAY WHAT HERE IN FRONT OF US- IN EITHER. SITUATION YOU KNOW YOU'RE GONNA NEED TO BE THINKING ABOUT WHAT ARE THE AND- THE RIGHT COST EFFECTIVE STRATEGIES AND HOW ARE YOU GOING TO BE- INCENTIVIZING THEM AND ROLLING THEM OUT AND DEPLOYING THEM IN AN EFFECTIVE WAY AND THAT'S TRUE- AT WHICH EITHER A TIME FRAME THAT YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT. ALL RIGHT UNLIKE MY LAST QUESTION FOR NOW IS. AGAIN GOING TO THAT- THAT THE BALANCING ACT BETWEEN THE DIRECT EMISSION REDUCTIONS VERSUS- THE RELIANCE ON CARBON CAPTURE AND SEQUESTRATION. IN YOUR OPINION SHOULD THE LEGISLATURE- REQUIRE A MINIMUM LEVEL OF EMISSION RDUCTIONS- THAT MUST BE ACHIEVED IN CALIFORNIA. IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE OUR CARBON NEUTRALITY GOAL. I THINK HE- THE IMPORTANCE OF THE SCOPING PLAN PROCESS IS THAT EVERY FIVE YEARS WE GET TO LOOK AT WHERE WE ARE. AND WHAT WE'VE ACHIEVED WHAT WE HAVEN'T ACHIEVED AND WHERE WE NEED TO GO NOW. AND I THINK THE IMPORTANCE OF THAT CAREFUL DETAILED ANALYSIS THAT ACCOMPANIED BY PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT- YOU THAT THE SCIENCE AND THAT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE REAL WORLD. I THINK THAT PROCESS IS THE RIGHT PROCESS YOU THINK ABOUT. MAINTAINING THAT NEEDED THE FLEXIBILITY TO GET TO THE GOAL THAT WE NEED TO ACHIEVE. THANK YOU SIR ALAN BUDD'S THANK YOU MANAGER THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR ALL YOUR WORK. I'M I JUST LOVE TO GET YOUR THOUGHTS ON ON- THE CHANGING. RELATIONSHIP WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ON THE ISSUES YOUR CON AND HOW YOUR- SEEING THEIR WORK MOVING FORWARD HI GIVEN SOME OF THE THINGS WE'RE HEARING KIND OF THE WHITE HOUSE. AND ALSO OTHER STATES. SURE WE AT CARP HAVE ENGAGED- WITH THE FEDERAL EMIGRATE FOR MANY YEARS AND- AND WHEN I STARTED MY POSITION I WAS FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO HAVE- YOU KNOW A NEW ADMINISTRATION THAT WAS- INTERESTED IN THE SAME GOALS WE WERE- AND SO- WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO. ENGAGE WITH THEM AND REALLY ADVOCATE ON SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WE THINK ARE REALLY CRITICAL NEXT STEPS- THE NEW- EMISSION STANDARDS- IN LIGHT DUTY VEHICLES BUT ALSO- THINKING ABOUT WHERE- THE FEDERAL LEADERSHIP CAN BE IN FEDERALLY REGULATED SOURCES- SO THAT. ASKING THEM TO CONSIDER ADOPTING SOMETHING SIMILAR TO OUR LOW NOT OMNIBUS RULE TO CLEAN UP- TRACKING NATIONWIDE- THE THINKING ABOUT ACTORS LAKE LOCOMOTIVES AND AVIATION- AND SO WE HAVE REALLY BEEN ADVOCATING AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL- THAT. THAT MAY INTO THE STRAW THAT WILL HAVE NATIONWIDE- AND WORLDWIDE BENEFITS- BUT AS WE MENTIONED EARLIER- YOU KNOW WE NEED THE WHOLE COUNTRY TO BE MOVING IN THE SAME DIRECTION- SO AND THEN OF COURSE THE BIG DISCUSSION AROUND INFRASTRUCTURE- IS REALLY IMPORTANT THE- INVESTMENTS THAT WE NEED TO BE. IN AT VERY MISSION TECHNOLOGIES AND- AND THAT THE HEALING INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THAT- THOSE ARE ALL ALL IMPORTANT CONVERSATIONS- THAT WE HAVE AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL- AND SO I THINK I AM VERY OPTIMISTIC- THAT WE CAN MAKE IT PROGRESS. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. IF NOT I I'D LIKE TO. PERHAPS WELL THE LAWYER I KNOW I SHOULD NEVER SAID THIS IS MY LAST QUESTION BUT- GOING FOLLOWING UP ON YOUR YOUR YOUR LAST RESPONSE IN TERMS OF THE IMPORTANCE OF THE SCOPING PLAN HAVING THE FLEXIBILITY TO ASSESS IN REAL TIME THE- THE REALITIES NOT ONLY OF. THE EMISSIONS THE TOXIC POLLUTANTS BUT ALSO THE STATE OF THE ECONOMY THE STATE OF. YOU KNOW ANY ANY LEAKAGE MEANT THAT MAYBE TAKEN PLACE- YOU KNOW I WANTED TO. SEE WHAT YOU THOUGHT OF- THAT THE FACT THAT IT TO MY UNDERSTANDING- THE STATE'S OF WASHINGTON AND THE STATE OF THAT THE STATE OF WASHINGTON IN THE STATE OF. MASSACHUSETTS HAVE IN THE PAST YEAR ADOPTED- CARBON NEUTRALITY- LAWS THAT- THAT SPECIFY- AT LEAST A NINETY PERCENT- YOU KNOW EIGHT SHAVING CARBON NEUTRALITY THROUGH AT LEAST A NINETY PERCENT- CARBON EMISSIONS- REDUCTION- I MEAN NAG I DIRECT EMISSION REDUCTIONS- COULD COULD COULD YOU WELL. COMMENT ON YOUR OPINION ON ON YOU KNOW. THE WISDOM OR ARE YOU KNOW WHETHER CALIFORNIA SHOULD IT SHOULD BE OF A FOLLOWING. A SIMILAR PATH IN TERMS OF HAVING GONE. A REALISTIC- ROADMAP TO ACHIEVING CARBON NEUTRALITY- INTERSTATE. I AM I WAS REALLY PLEASED WITH THE- WASHINGTON MASSACHUSETTS YOU KNOW- IMPLEMENT THE- THEIR NEW LEGISLATION AND- AND I THINK IT'S I THINK IT'S AN EXCITING OPPORTUNITY- I HAVE TO SAY I FEEL THAT- YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA HAS MADE A LOT OF PROGRESS AND- AND CONTINUES TO MAKE PROGRESS AND SO- I LEAVE IT TO THE WISDOM OF THE LEGISLATURE AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THEY WANT TO DO SOMETHING. DIFFERENT SO I GUESS I'LL JUST LEAVE IT AT THAT. VERY DIPLOMATICALLY STATED THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS ARE A LOT LIKE TO- WELCOME ASSEMBLY WOMAN BURKE- MEMBER THEY THAT THE COMMITTEE- ASSEMBLY WOMAN ON AND DID YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS OR ANY QUESTIONS. OKAY ARE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. ALL RIGHT CHEN AROUND OFF THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. I REALLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT TO A NEXT- I'D LIKE TO PROCEED TO OUR SECOND PANEL. WHICH IS- A PRESENTATION FROM OUR LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE ROSS BROWN- PRINCIPLE FISCAL AND POLICY ANALYST ON CLIMATE CHANGE- AS WELL AS- TWO MEMBERS OF THE INDEPENDENT. AND LET'S GET THAT LONG ACRONYM- MIXED UP ARE YOU MAC- DOCTOR DAN CULLEN WARD. AND PROFESSOR MEREDITH VALLEY SO LIKE TO ASK- MISTER BROWN WITH THE L. A. L. TO- START OF STARTS OFF ON THE SECOND PANEL OF OUR HEARING TODAY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN BIRDS ROSS BROWN WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- I'VE BEEN ASKED TO. REALLY KIND OF FOCUS ON THREE QUESTIONS AS PART OF OUR PRESENTATION HERE ONE WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE STATE'S PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW- TO ARE WE ON TRACK TO MEET THE STATE'S SB THIRTY TWO GOALS IN TWENTY THIRTY. AND THREE WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS OF CAN ANSWER STUDENTS QUESTIOS FOR A LONG TERM CARBON NEUTRALITY GOALS. ARE SO BEFORE I KIND OF GET INTO THOSE QUESTIONS I DID JUST WANT TO REITERATE A COUPLE THINGS AND PROVIDE JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE CONTEXT AT SOME OF THIS DISCUSSION- AS CHAIR RANDOLPH MENTIONS AND AS I'M SURE ALL OF YOU KNOW WE'VE MET OUR- TWENTY TWENTY GOAL EARLY BUT THE TWENTY THIRTY GOAL- WE HAVE AS MUCH MORE AMBITIOUS AND JUSTIN. QUANTITATIVE TERMS THE ANNUAL REDUCTIONS NEEDED TO MEET OUR THE TWENTY TWENTY GOAL IS ABOUT ONE PERSON PER YEAR- WHEREAS THE REDUCTIONS NEEDED TO MEET THE TWENTY THIRTY GOALS ABOUT 4% PER YEAR SO THAT'S A- BIG DIFFERENCE IN TERMS OF. THE LEVEL OF AMBITION- AND AS FAR AS CERTAIN MEETING OUR GOALS SO FAR- AGAIN COMPANIES YOUR PROBABLY ALL WELL WELL AWARE OF BUT THE ELECTRICITY SECTOR EMISSIONS HAVE REALLY BEEN THE LARGEST CONTRIBUTOR TO THE REDUCTION SO FAR- BUT IN ORDER TO MAKE THAT MORE AMBITIOUS TWENTY THIRTY GOAL IT'S GONNA REQUIRE REDUCTIONS FROM OTHER AREAS BESIDES JUST. THE ELECTRICITY SECTOR- THEY ARE THING I JUST WANTED TO ON THIS HAS. AS I DO KNOW BRIAN OF POWER I'M NOT TO WALK ALL OF THEM. AROUND OFF ON A LOT OF THEM INCLUDING RIGHT. AND SEND. CAP AND TRADE- I THINK FROM OUR OFFICES PERSPECTIVE WHAT KIND OF SOME OF THE FRAMING THAT WE USED TO THINK ABOUT- YOU KNOW CONSIDERATIONS FOR MERIT TO THE DIFFERENT POLICIES. INCLUDE THE COST EFFECTIVENESS IS ALWAYS KIND OF- AN IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION FOR OUR OFFICE AND SOMETHING THAT WE LOOK INTO- BUT ALSO- COMPENSATES WHICH APARTMENT DISCUSSED ABOUT THINGS LIKE ARTICLE POLLUTION LOCAL AIR POLLUTION. EQUITY CONSIDERATIONS AND DISTRIBUTION OF COSTS AND BENEFITS. AND FINALLY THE AFFECTS OF THE STATE'S POLICIES- BUT HAPPENS IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS- AND THAT COULD MEAN. THINGS LIKE THAT RICH WHICH CALIFORNIA'S POLICIES. PROMOTE NEW TECHNOLOGIES ARE OR REDUCE THE COST OF DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGIES THAT CAN GET UP IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS. OR WHETHER OR NOT IT'S A POLICY IS SERVICES AND EFFECTIVE DEMONSTRATION FOR OTHER JURISDICTIONS THAT ARE LOOKING TO ADOPT. MORE AMBITIOUS CLIMATE POLICIES AND SO- THESE ARE ALL KIND OF THINGS TO THINK ABOUT OF COURSE I'M THINKING ABOUT YOU KNOW WHAT WE'VE ACHIEVED SO FAR IN TERMS OF POLICIES BUT ALSO. CONSIDERATIONS GOING FORWARD. SO WITH THAT I WANT JUST OUTLINED INTO AN- MY- ON A OF THE BY. THAT I'M- MISTER MY TIME ON THIS FOR QUESTION ABOUT WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF. OTHER PROGRAMS AND POLICIES THAT WE ALREADY HAVE IN PLACE- FOR CONTEXT OUR OFFICE DOES HAVE AN ANNUAL REPORTING REQUIREMENT AND STATUTE RIGHT NOW. TO REPORT ANNUALLY ON THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS AND COSTS OF THE STATE'S. CLIMATE PROGRAMS AND SO RICHARD A COUPLE REPORTS ONE OF THEM I FOCUSED ON THE STATE'S MAJOR TRANSPORTATION POLICIES. ANOTHER FOCUS ON ELECTRIC ELECTRICITY GENERATION SO SOME OF MY COMMENTS ARE REALLY BASED ON. FINDING AND FINDING THEM THOSE RECORDS. I THINK REALLY THE KEY FINDING FROM- ONE OF THE KEY FINDINGS FROM BOTH OF THOSE REPORTS IS THAT WE REALLY DON'T HAVE GREAT. PROGRAM ABOUT ASIAN INFORMATION- ABOUT KIND OF THE OVERALL COSTS AND BENEFITS OF SPECIFIC POLICIES AND SPECIFIC PROGRAMS- THERE'S A MAKING OF LIMITED INFORMATION IN MANY CASES- NOW BASED ON THAT INFORMATION THAT IS AVAILABLE- BUT SOME OF THAT THE FINDINGS THAT WE DON'T HAVE OR THAT- YOU KNOW THAT THINGS LIKE THE RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO. LIKELY HAD THE BIGGEST EFFECT ON A MISSION REDUCTIONS OF THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. AND A RELATIVELY MODEST OR MODERATE COSTS ARE BASED ON OUR SOME OF OUR BACK OF THE ENVELOPE CALCULATIONS IS ABOUT SIXTY TO SEVENTY DOLLARS. PER TON WHICH IS NO MORE THAN THAT ARE THE PRICE OF A CAP AND TRADE ALLOWANCE BUT LESS THAN. SOME OF THE OTHER POLICIES WHICH- THE AVAILABLE INFORMATION SUGGESTS THE COST PER TON ARE. YOU KNOW NOT TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS PER TIME ROUGHLY IN THE CASE OF THE LCS US FOR EXAMPLE OR IN THE CASE OF SOME OF OUR- INCENTIVE PROGRAM THAT'S OVER A- THOUSAND DOLLARS PER TIME- AND SO I DON'T BUT IN MOST CASES THERE'S REALLY LIMITED KIND OF RELIABLE INFORMATION ON THE COSTS. AND BENEFITS OF SOME OF THE DIFFERENT POLICIES- AND SO I MEAN I DO IT IN THAT VEIN I THINK I DO WANT TO ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT. IN MANY CASES. IT'S VERY HARD TO KIND OF MEASURE THESE THINGS REALLY WELL- IT'S NOT JUST A MATTER OF COLLECTING DATA AND TRACKING EMISSIONS INTERPRET. SO I WE WANT TO KNOW EFFECT OF THE PARTICULAR POWER. THERE'S A LOT OF OTHER. FACTORS CHANGING. CONDITIONS CHANGES IN MY PRICE THAT MIGHT HAVE OCCURRED OTHERWISE FEDERAL AND LOCAL POLICIES. AS WELL AS JUST OVERLAP BETWEEN KIND OF THE DIFFERENT STATE POLICIES THAT WE HAVE BEEN SO WONDERFUL THIS IS OUR- ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES WE HAVE. REGULATION ENCOURAGING I'M MORE PRODUCTION OF ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES. AS WELL AS INCENTIVES TO ENCOURAGE CONSUMERS TO PURCHASE VEHICLES AN ANSWER AS TO. ENCOURAGE ADDITIONAL CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE AND SO- TRYING TO THIRTIES OUT. WOULD BE AFFECTED AFFECTED NURSING AFFECTS ALL OF THOSE DIFFERENT POLICIES THAT EXTREMELY CHALLENGING SO THAT. WE SAY THANK ARE ARE RELATED MAIN RECOMMENDATION FROM SOME OF THESE RECORDS- IF YOU KIND OF THE IT'S MY TESTIMONY WITH ONE THING I THINK THIS IS REALLY AT AS- WE DO RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE REALLY KIND OF THINK ABOUT CONSIDER PROCESS FOR GETTING BETTER INFORMATION ABOUT PROGRAM AFFECTS. A POLICY THAT WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED SO FAR. AND THIS COULD INCLUDE THINGS LIKE- PLANNING BEFOREHAND BEFORE POLICY IS IMPLEMENTED A NEW POLICIES IMPLEMENTED OR PROGRAM IS EXPANDED. ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTS. AND I CAN INCLUDE THINGS LIKE WORKING WITH EXPERTS OUR OUTSIDE APPETITE ECONOMICS ON WHAT DATA WOULD BE NEEDED. YOU KNOW WHAT METHODS MIGHT BE USED WHAT ARE NOT THERE'S A. FINALLY IT GOOD COULD LIKELY MANY CASES REQUIRE A LITTLE BIT A BIT MORE FUNDING TO. SUPPORT THESE TYPES OF EFFORTS BUT IN OUR DELUXE ARE. RELATIVELY IT WOULD BE A RELATIVELY MODEST AMOUNT PROBABLY COMPARED TO JUST THE OVERALL SIZE AND SCOPE OF THESE PROGRAMS. I REALLY THAT. YOU HAVE THAT REASON FOR- IN FOCUSING ON EVALUATING PROGRAMS WE HAD I THINK ARE ARE KIND OF TWO FOLD ONE. JUST YOU KNOW HAVING THAT INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT'S WORKING AND WHAT'S NOT- IS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR INFORMING LONG TERM POLICY DECISIONS IN CALIFORNIA ON THE EFFECTS THAT. OCCUR IN CALIFORNIA. TRYING TO ADOPT THE MOST AFFECTED PROGRAMS. BUT ALSO IN THE SPACE AND THE CLIMATE CHANGE SPACE. ARE AT STAKE I HAVE THE POTENTIALLY HELP SERVICE. I'M NOT SORT OF DEMONSTRATION ROLE TO THE REST OF THE WORLD TO THE DEGREE WE HAVE. BETTER INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT'S WORKED WHAT WORKS WHAT DOESN'T QUITE WORK WHAT TE DIFFERENT TRADE OFFS OF ARE ASSOCIATED WITH DIFFERENT OPTIONS. I CAN REALLY CAN HELP INFORM SOME OF THOSE DECISIONS IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS AND PERHAPS GOING TO PROMOTE. MORE AMBITIOUS ACTION THERE. SO THAT WAS MAIN THOSE ARE OF THE MAIN. I WANTED TO MAKE A KIND OF TALK ON A COUPLE OTHER. ARE OTHER ONE I WE ON. TO THE TWENTY THIRTY GOAL. ARE B. MOST RECENT SCOPING PLAN TWENTY SEVENTEEN- RELIES PRETTY HEAVILY ON CAP AND TRADE TO MEET THE- TWENTY THIRTY GOALS AND IN GENERAL OUR OFFICE IS ARE SUPPORTED BY OF CARBON PRICING. INCLUDING CAP AND TRADE IS REALLY A- A CORE STRATEGY FOR ACHIEVING REMISSION REDUCTIONS WE DO THINK. THERE'S A LOT OF EVIDENCE SUGGESTING THAT THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE APPROACH TO REDUCING EMISSIONS- BUT IT'S NOT CLEAR THAT THE PROGRAM HAS STRUCTURED TODAY. TODAY IN DESIGNS AND IMPLEMENTED TODAY IT'S REALLY SET OUT TO ACCOMPLISH THE TASK PASCO COUNTY. ALLOWING THE STATE TO ME THAT'S TWENTY THIRTY GOALS ARE HAPPY TO KIND OF DISCUSS THOSE CAP AND TRADE ISSUES AND DESIGN ISSUES. ARE FURTHER- BUT IT IT JUST KIND OF WANT TO FLAG THAT IS SORT OF ONE OF THE KEY KIND OF UP TO DRAW CONCERNED AREAS OF CONCERN WE HAVE ABOUT WHETHER NOT THE CURRENCY TO POLICIES. IS SET UP TO CHEAT THE LEGISLATORS. TWENTY THIRTY GOALS- FINALLY. OUT WHAT IS. ALL FIVE CARBON. BY THEY'RE THEY'RE STILL I THINK A LOT WORK TO- TO MEET THOSE TWENTY THIRD. OUR GOALS THAT WE ALREADY HAVE IN STATUTE AND I SOME UNCERTAINTY RIGHT NOW ABOUT EXACTLY HOW THOSE GOALS WILL BE MET- AND OF COURSE THERE. WILL BE CAN'T EVEN MORE UNCERTAINTY ABOUT. SOME OF THE LONGER TERM GOALS AND HOW THEY'RE NOT. OUT WE DO THINK LONGER TERM GOALS CAN BE HELPFUL TO REALLY GUIDE PLANNING- AND HELP. OUT FOR EXAMPLE- AVOID THINGS LIKE STRANDED ASSETS AND INVESTING IN THINGS THAT WON'T BE USED ANYMORE. AS WELL AS PROVIDE- LONG TERM MARKET SIGNALS- BUT AGAIN CIRCLING BACK TO KIND OF ONE OF OUR MAIN POINTS OUT WE THINK NOT GOOD EVALUATION IS REALLY KEY TO UNDERSTANDING. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF TRADEOFFS ASSOCIATED WITH THE POLICY CHOICES WE HAVE AND INFORMED DECISIONS ABOUT. I WISH POLICIES TO ADOPT A REALLY KIND OF THE HOW HOW WE GET THERE WE THINK IS A REALLY. IMPORTANT- I. GONNA MARC MARKS POWER. COME ALLEGED TO ME ITS GOAL OF THE MOST. COME FOR POTENTIAL TREATED MORE AMBITIOUS. AT AT SIMILAR. JUST OTHER SWEET OF. POLICIES THAT MIGHT BE ABLE BIT MARC. SO ARE THOSE ARE ARE MAIN. OF COURSE HAPPY TO- CONTINUE DISCUSSION AND ANSWER ANY QUESTION THAT YOU HAVE. STATE THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER BROWN- QUESTIONS. SENATE SKINNER THAN CENTER BACKER. WHAT THE MOVE IN THE GLASS ALL OVER SORRY- THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS AND- NO OF THE L. A. O. IS ISSUED NUMEROUS REPORTS OVER THE YEARS ON CAP AND TRADE THE ON YOU KNOW ON THE EXPENDITURE PLAN LAST YEAR BACK WHEN WE WERE AND- RENEWING ITS THE- THE WHOLE. THE PROPOSAL IS YOU DID EVALUATION OF THOSE. WHAT I'M WONDERING IS IF THE L. A. ALWAYS PLANNING ON YOU MADE A REFERENCE TO THAT THE L. A. O. SUPPORTS MARKET MEASURES AS BEING ONE OF THE MORE EFFECTIVE WAYS FOR US TO MEET OUR GOALS AND CAP AND TRADE BEING ONE. HI HAS THE L. A. O. CONSIDERED PRODUCING REPORT ON WHAT OTHER MARKET MEASURES WE MIGHT BE CONSIDERING AND- ADDITIONALLY HOW THE L. A. O. WOOD. REVISE RESTRUCTURE OR WHATEVER- OR RECOMMENDATIONS FOR. REVISIONS TO OUR CURRENT CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM HAS L. A. O. CONSIDERED. USING THAT. YEAH SENATORS GONNA THEIR- BOTH KIND OF ISSUES THAT WE THOUGHT QUITE A BIT ABOUT I DON'T KNOW I CAN'T SAY THAT WE HAVE- HAVE A PRODUCT IN THE WORKS RIGHT NOW- I THINK THOSE ARE BOTH VERY IMPORTANT ISSUES AND- I THINK JUST GOING BACK TO. WELL ACTUALLY BOTH OF THEM I THINK WE HAVE OFFERED SOME OF OUR COMMENTS. REGARDING ALTERNATIVE MARKET MEASURES LIKE A CARBON TAX I THINK THERE ARE. THE TRADE OFFS BETWEEN SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND CAP AND TRADE- AND OF COURSE HAPPY TO EXPLORE THOSE WERE SOME TIME AGO AND CLEARLY THINGS. THAT WAS THEN THIS IS NOW. SURE SO WHAT WE ARE OF COURSE ALWAYS- OPEN TO- KIND OF DIVING INTO SOME OF THESE ISSUES FOR IT PARTICULARLY IF YOU HAVE AN INTEREST OR THE INTERESTS OF THE COMMITTEE. THAT KIND OF LOOKING INTO SOME OF THOSE ALTERNATIVE OPTIONS IN MORE DETAIL I IN TERMS OF KIND OF REVISIONS TO THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM- AGAIN AT IT YOU KNOW ITS- IT'S NOW KIND OF A COUPLE YEARS OLD BUT I THINK. SOME OF THE OPTIONS THAT WE HAVE LOOKED AT IN THE PAST WAS JUST KIND OF YOU KNOW ESSENTIALLY OPTIONS TO DEAL WITH. WHAT WE DO AS- A LARGE AMOUNT OF BANKED ALLOWANCES THAT ARE OUT THERE THAT- HAVE EFFECTIVE KIND OF REDUCING MARKET PRICES OUT THERE AND START SETTING UP THE- PROGRAM IN A WAY THAT ISN'T REALLY CONSISTENT WITH THE AMBITION OF THE LEGISLATURE SCHOOLS AND- ARABI SORT OF CLEAREST WAY TO ADDRESS THAT COULD BE SOMETHING LIKE. ADJUSTING SORT OF THE- NUMBER OF ALLOWANCES THAT ARE ISSUED IN THE FUTURE AND THERE'S A RIGHT OF WAYS YOU COULD DO THAT. AB RIGHT IT KIND OF CONSIDERATIONS AROUND THAT BUT I THINK THAT'S ONE THING THAT IMMEDIATELY COMES TO MIND BUT AGAIN THAT'S ANOTHER. ISSUE WHERE- WE'RE HAPPY TO KIND OF CONTINUE TO KEEP EXPLORE FOR THEIR WITH WITH YOU AND THAT THE REST OF THE LEGISLATURE EFFECTS OF INTEREST. SIR SO ARE YOU IS THAT ARE YOU MORE OR LESS. INDICATING THAT WE WOULD NEED TO PROMPT. UP L. ROSE PRODUCTION OF SUCH THREE. I MEAN I THINK IT'S- IT'S ALWAYS HELPFUL TO FOR US TO KNOW- YOU KNOW WHICH QUESTIONS YOU ALL HAVE A COMMON MOST RELEVANT TO YOUR- POLICY DECISIONS AND SO- YEAH I CAN GET IT BUT IT'S ALWAYS HELPFUL TO KIND OF GET A SENSE. FROM YOU ALL- AROUND KIND OF WHAT WHAT THE KEY QUESTIONS ARE THAT YOU ARE MOST INTERESTED IN AND THEN- WE'RE ALWAYS HAPPY TO- KIND OF CONDUCT OUR ANALYSIS IN A WAY THAT THAT THAT THAT IT KIND OF HELPS ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS. OKAY SO WE WILL DEFINITELY FOLLOW UP ON A- PERHAPS EMITTING A REQUEST TO THE- L. A- CENTER BECKER AND THEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER. THANK YOU THANKS FOR COMMENTS. IT YOU MENTIONING A CAP AND TRADE AND- RESPONSE CENTER SCANNERS QUESTION AND THE OVER ALLOCATION OF BANK ALLOWANCES IS SOMETHING SO A STRONG A CONCERN TO ME AS WELL ESPECIALLY AS OUR- A CARBON PRICE HAS HAS BUMPED ALONG AT THE BOTTOM OF THE MARKET. RIGHT EIGHTEEN DOLLARS A TIME WHERE YOU'RE BRIGHT HOUSE AT SIXTY DOLLARS A TON SO I THINK WE DO HAVE TO. LOOK AT THAT AND WHAT WE CAN DO TO SEND A STRONGER MARKET SIGNAL THERE'S APPRECIATE YOU. RAISING THAT. BUT I GUESS THE QUESTION WE TALK ABOUT COST EFFECTIVENESS- REPORT FROM A NONPROFIT CALLED TOUR JUST CAME OUT NOW LOOKING AT SUPER USERS- OF TRANSPORTATION WE LOOK AT TRANSPORTATION AS A- AS ONE OF THE AREAS OF REDUCING. EMISSIONS INTO TERMS OF COST EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR- OUR INCENTIVES OF PEOPLE TRANSITIONING SAY TO ELECTRIC VEHICLES THAT HE THOUGHT AT ALL ABOUT THAT AND HOW DO WE TARGET PEOPLE WHO ARE DRIVING THE MOST AND OFTEN HAVE. THE CARS THAT HAVE THE LEAST FUEL EFFICIENCY AND HOW CAN WE TARGET OUR CENTERS THAT WAY FROM A COST. BENEFIT ANALYSIS. YEAH I MEAN I THINK- THERE'S A FEW DIFFERENT OPTIONS YOU HAVE I MEAN I THINK JUST THE FIRST THING THAT IMMEDIATELY COMES TO MIND AS AND THIS TIES BACK TO THE KIND OF CARBON PRICING CONVERSATION- WHICH IS THAT NO CARBON PRICE KIND OF. DOES THAT- TO A LARGE EXTENT ON THE NATURAL- SO YOU KNOW- INDIVIDUALS OR HOUSEHOLDS WHO ARE ARE BURNING A LOT OF FUEL EMITTING A LOT OF- CARBON FROM OTHER FUEL CONSUMPTION- THEY'RE THE ONES THAT KIND OF- TEND TO KIND OF HAVE TO- YOU KNOW THEY THEY SEE MORE OF KIND OF THE CARBON PRICING- SIGNAL AND SO IT KIND OF NATURALLY. I PROVIDES A LITTLE BIT OF THAT- IN TERMS OF. THE TARGET- SAY FINANCIAL INCENTIVES FOR- YOU KNOW VEHICLE NEW VEHICLE PURCHASES FROM HEAVY USERS I DON'T I'M NOT SOMETHING I GUESS WE HAVEN'T REALLY. LOOKED INTO AN A GREAT AMOUNT OF DEBT YEAH BUT AGAIN KIND OF HAPPY TO- TO. CIRCLE BACK AROUND WITH YOU AND YOUR STAFF TO THINK ABOUT THE ISSUE A LITTLE BIT MORE. THANKS TO THESE IMPORTANT SHOULD LOOK AT GOING FORWARD. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER MAYES THAN ASSEMBLYMEMBER BURKE- THANK YOU ROSS JUST- WANTED OF A TO ASK YOU THE SAME REALLY THE SAME QUESTION LAST OF THE OF THE CHAIR. OF CARVE- IN REGARDS TO THE EXPENDITURES THE DOLLARS THAT WE'VE COLLECTED- FOR- FROM THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM THE G. G. R. F. HOW WE SPENT THOSE DOLLARS AND THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO MAXIMIZE REDUCTIONS IN GREENHOUSE GASES. ARE THERE OTHER ALTERNATIVES- THAT WE SHOULD HAVE DONE AND SHOULD LOOK AT THE TOWARD REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. YEAH I MEAN I THINK IN TERMS OF JUST THE INFORMATION WE HAVE AVAILABLE AND THE ABSTINENCE OF WHAT EACH PROGRAM IS ACCOMPLISHING IN TERMS OF COST PER TIME REDUCED- AT LEAST IN TERMS OF DIRECT REDUCTIONS I THINK IT'S PRETTY CLEAR THAT YOU KNOW WE ARE NOT NECESSARILY FOCUSING OUR SPENDING ON. THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE- APPROACHES I MEAN IF YOU LOOK AT EVEN JUST THE REPORTING FROM THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD ON A COST PER TIME YOU'LL SEE A RANGE FROM YOU KNOW ROUGHLY TEN DOLLARS PER TIME OUT TO A FEW THOUSAND DOLLARS PER TIME- NOW I THINK YOU KNOW OUR PERSPECTIVE IS THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO KIND OF. NOTE THAT YOU KNOW THAT'S KIND OF LOOKING AT IT FROM A TERROR SORT OF DIRECT CARBON EMISSION REDUCTIONS AND THAT'S OBVIOUSLY IMPORTANT I THINK A LOT OF OTHER CONSIDERATIONS GO INTO SPENDING DECISIONS OF COURSE AS YOU KNOW- AROUND KIND OF OTHER TYPES OF COAL POLLUTANTS AND CO BENEFITS THAT MIGHT SORT OF PLAY INTO SOME OF THOSE CONSIDERATIONS- I THINK ANOTHER BIG PIECE. IS THE SORT OF TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT AND QUESTION A LOT OF THE PROGRAMS WE HAVE TO FOCUS ON PILOTS AND DEMONSTRATIONS ARE WITH KIND OF THE IDEA THAT THERE WILL BE A LONG TERM BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH. PROMOTING A- KIND OF NEWER TECHNOLOGY AND SO THOSE ARE THOSE ARE BENEFITS THAT ARE A LITTLE BIT MORE DIFFICULT TO QUANTIFY AND DON'T REALLY SHOW UP IN SOME OF THOSE JUST CARE COST PER TIME CONSIDERATIONS BUT WE ARE WE DO WE DO THINK THAT'S KIND OF ONE IMPORTANT THING TO THINK ABOUT AS WELL. RIGHT RIGHT AND DID YOU THINK IT BE DIFFERENT IF THERE ARE SOME OTHER MECHANISM OF REVENUE LIKE A CARBON TAX THAT THERE'S A DIRECT CARBON TAX DO YOU THINK THAT WE WOULD BE BETTER- WITH COLLECTING THAT REVENUE AND SPENDING. IT TOWARD REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. THAT'S SOMETHING I CAN'T- I CAN'T REALLY SAY I MEAN THOSE- APPROPRIATION DECISIONS ARE ARE UP TO THE LEGISLATURE- AND MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE. SO I CAN'T SAY SORT OF HOW ON A SPENDING WITH THIS. CHANGE AT ALL IF THEY WERE JUST A DIFFERENT KIND OF MECHANISM FOR COLLECTING. FOR COLLECTING THE REVENUE I WHAT I CAN SAY ON THE REVENUE SIDE AS THE- YOU KNOW THERE ARE ALTERNATIVE OPPORTUNITIES ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES- LIKE A CARBON TAX- THEY DO HAVE DIFFERENT CHARACTERISTICS IN TERMS OF THE VOLATILITY OF THE REVENUE SO THERE'S- POTENTIALLY WAYS TO KIND OF STRUCTURE THOSE THAT- REDUCE SOME OF THE REVENUE VOLATILITY THAT WE'VE SEEN IN PAST YEARS SO- I THINK A LOT OF A DIFFERENT SORT OF SHOW UP ON THAT SIDE OF THINGS- BETTER KIND OF DECISIONS ABOUT HOW THE MONEY IS ALLOCATED. REALLY SORT OF DEPENDS ON LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES AND ALLOCATIONS. OKAY THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY WOMAN- BURKE. SO MIKE A GROUP BECAUSE BY TO THIS. COMING ABOUT THOSE WHO TRY FURTHER- AND A CARBON TAX AND THE COST AFFECTS I WAS WONDERING WHEN YOU LOOK AT THOSE THINGS ESPECIALLY FOR PEOPLE OF MY DISTRICT THEY DRIVE FURTHER BECAUSE- THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO LIVE. WHERE THEY WORK- ARE THOSE EQUITY CONVERSATIONS GOING TO BE INCLUDED IN ANY REPORT YOU'RE DOING ARE ARE THEY INCLUDED IN THOSE CONVERSATIONS- AND REPORTS AS YOU'RE HAVING THEM- DIRECT EFFECT WE DON'T HAVE ELECTRIC VEHICLES IN OUR DISTRICT BECAUSE WE CAN'T. AFFORD THEM NOR DO OUR HOUSING STRUCTURES ALLOW- HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY OR THE ABILITY TO HAVE THEM SELL- I'M JUST WONDERING WHERE EQUITY FALLS IN THAT CONVERSATION. YEAH I MEAN IT THREE EQUITIES CONSIDERATIONS- AND ARGUE SHOULD ABSOLUTELY BE PART OF THE- CONVERSATION- AND I THINK THAT'S PART OF WHAT SORT OF MAKES A LOT OF THE DECISIONS SO DIFFICULT AND ONE. POLICY MIGHT- MIGHT WORK WELL I'M KIND OF ONE METRIC WHETHER IT COST-EFFECTIVENESS- AND MAYBE NOT AS WELL ON SOME OTHER METRIC- LIKE EQUITY I MEAN I THINK IN THE CASE OF. A CAP AND TRADE OR A CARBON PRICING IN GENERAL THERE'S- IT HAS THE BENEFIT OF HAVING A LOT OF OPTIONS FOR TRYING TO ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE% EQUITY CONSIDERATIONS THE FACT THAT. THE STATE DOES COLLECT REVENUE AS A RESULT IN CAN USE THAT REVENUE IN A WAY THAT. IS TARGETED TO OFFSET SOME OF THOSE EFFECTS- IS SORT OF A BENEFIT OF CARBON PRICING IN GENERAL BUT I THINK OVERALL. WE THINK ABOUT THE DIFFERENT POLICY OPTIONS WE HAVE THINKING ABOUT NOT JUST COST EFFECTIVENESS BUT HOW THOSE COSTS AND BENEFITS ARE DISTRIBUTED IS REALLY. IMPORTANT PART OF THE CONVERSATION OF SOMETHING THAT WE- WILL CONTINUE TO TRY TO- CONSIDER AND ACTIVISTS ACTORS GET INFORMATION KIND OF HIGHLIGHT I WAS SORT OF ONE OF THE TRADE ALSO CONSIDERATIONS. AND THE DIFFERENT POLICY OPTIONS WE HAVE. THANK YOU. FOR I GUESS I'D LIKE TO- RUN OUT OUR- REQUEST FOR YOU MISTER BROWN WITH THE- YOU BRING IT BACK TO. ONE OF MY MAIN QUESTIONS- GLENN ONE OF MY MAIN GOALS FOR THIS HEARING TODAY IS TO TRY TO GET. YOU KNOW. AS CLOSER DEFINITIVE ANSWER IN IN IN TERMS OF WHETHER WE'RE ON TRACK TO MEET OUR TWENTY THIRTY GOAL- I HEARD YOU SAY THAT. THE TWENTY THIRTY GOAL IS MUCH MORE AMBITIOUS I HEARD YOU SAY THAT THE TWENTY THIRTY- SCOPING PLAN THE LAST CUP INCLINED- THE PLAN RELIES HEAVILY. ON CAP AND TRADE THAT WHILE- IT IT- IS APPEARS TO BE THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE THAT IT'S- WHAT I HEARD YOU SAYING WAS ADDED RAISES CONCERNS ABOUT WHETHER WE ARE IN FACT ON TRACK TO MEETING OR TWENTY THIRTY GOAL. YEAH I MEAN I THINK- BASED ON KIND OF THE INFORMATION WE HAVE NOW IN THE PLAN THAT THE STATE ADOPTED SEVERAL YEARS AGO AND WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT- THE ROLE CAP AND TRADE PLAYED AND SO KIND OF HOW IT'S ACTUALLY- DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED RIGHT NOW I THINK WE HAVE WE DON'T I FRANKLY HAVE A LOT OF CONFIDENCE THAT KIND OF THE CURRENT- POLICY FRAMEWORK AND KIND OF SET OF POLICIES AND DESIGN OF POLICIES IT'S GONNA- IS GONNA HELP US MEET THAT TWENTY THIRTY BALK NOW THERE'S A LOT OF. A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY OF COURSE BETWEEN NOW AND TWENTY THIRTY THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS THAT COULD CHANGE- EVEN OUTSIDE OF SORT OF THE STATE POLICY WORLD LIKE CHANGING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS WE OBVIOUSLY ARE STILL NOT A PANDEMIC WHICH AS YOU KNOW HUGE EFFECTS THERE COULD BE CHANGES IN FEDERAL POLICY THAT HAVE. A SIGNIFICANT AFFECTS ON ON STATE EMISSIONS AND SO ALL THOSE THINGS- YOU KNOW COULD SORT OF REALLY CHANGE CHANGE THE WORLD GOING FORWARD OUT OF TWENTY THIRTY BUT AS FAR AS- WHERE WE SIT NOW AND WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT KIND BUT IT'S NOT A PLAN THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW. WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF CONFIDENCE THAT WERE. OUR CURRENT SORT OF. IS GOING TO HELP US MEET THOSE. ARE I THINK WE DON'T. A LOT OF FOLKS THAT- THAT THEY- NEW MODELING DONE BY A RP. THAT'S OF ITS TWENTY SCOPING PLAN WILL REALLY- HELP ANSWER THIS QUESTION OF RIGHT A LITTLE BIT MORE INSIGHTS INTO. WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW- GIVEN THAT THE LAST GOVERNMENT PLAN WAS SEVERAL YEARS AGO. IN TERMS OF WHAT OUR CURRENT POLICY SCENARIO IS AND WHAT WE SORT OF INVASION. OUR CURRENT POLICIES ARE GOING TO ACHIEVE AND THEN- AND THEN HELP SPREAD THIS CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT IF ANYTHING- IN TERMS OF ADDITIONAL POLICIES ARE NEEDED TO MEET UP TWENTY THIRTY GOAL. SO YOU WITH YOUR. CONCERN ABOUT WHETHER. ARE YOUR YOUR YOUR LEVEL OF CONFIDENCE AND WHETHER WE ARE ON TRACK TO MEETING OUR TWENTY THIRTY GOAL- I KNOW THAT FOR EXAMPLE ASSEMBLY BILL ON ONE NINETY SEVEN. REQUIRED DATE THE A R. B. TO PRIORITIZE DIRECT EMISSION REDUCTIONS- AND YET- THE AND THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN SCOPING PLAN- HAS INCREASED IN THE- BED THE EXPECTED ROLE OF REDUCTIONS TO NEARLY HALF OF ALL REQUIRED- THROUGH CAP AND TRADE- SHOULD WE BE. PASSING POLICIES THAT PLACE GREATER EMPHASIS ON PRIORITIZING DIRECT EMISSION REDUCTIONS OVER CAP AND TRADE. I THINK THE ANSWER THAT COMIC COMES DOWN TO SOMEBODY'S THE QUESTIONS WE'VE ALREADY BEEN DISCUSSING AROUND- YOU KNOW HOW THE LEGISLATURE PRIORITIZES- DIFFERENT CRITERIA ON HONEST POLICIES ON TERMS OF COST EFFECTIVENESS THINK AGAIN KIND OF YOU KNOW CONCENTRATE OR SOME SORT OF CARBON PRICING POLICY. IF THAT'S YOUR OVER PRIMARY METRIC FOR ACHIEVING THOSE GOALS WE THINK KIND OF ANGEL CHANGES THEY ARE FOCUSING ON MAKING SURE THAT THAT THE PRICING POLICIES ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE STATE'S GOALS THAT IS REALLY WHERE YOU SHOULD FOCUS YOUR EFFORTS. I'M NOT NECESSARILY KIND OF OTHER- DIRECT EMISSION REDUCTION POLICIES HOWEVER THERE ARE pCONSIDERATIONS- AROUNDS- YOU KNOW- DEVELOPING NEWER TECHNOLOGIES OR- OTHER CO POLLUTANT ISSUES THAT THERE ARE ARE JUST KIND OF THERE'S A PROFIT OTHER POLICIES WILL REDUCE COPELAND'S MORE THAN CAP AND TRADE FOR EXAMPLE. AND THAT COULD BE A CONSIDERATION ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE LEGISLATURE WAYS THOSE OF THE OTHER THINGS- I BELIEVE AND- THERE CAN CERTAINLY BE AN ARGUMENT. FOR FOCUSING ON SOME OF THOSE OTHER POLICIES. IF OUR PRIMARY IF THE- PRIMER. IS TO TUNE IN MATE V. STATUTORY- GOAL OF- SB THIRTY TWO THAT THE TWENTY THIRTY GOAL. SHOULD A GREATER EMPHASIS BE PLACED ON DIRECT EMISSION REDUCTIONS. I THINK NOT NECESSARILY AND I THINK- I THINK YOU YOU HAVE THE OPTION OF LOOKING AT DIRECT EMISSION REDUCTIN POLICIES OR CARBON PRICING IN CAP AND TRADE AND I THINK- IF IT'S IF IT'S STRICTLY ON KIND OF A- COST EFFECTIVENESS CARBON REDUCTIONS. OUT WE THINK KIND OF FOCUSING ON- MODIFYING THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM TO KIND OF PROVIDE GREATER INCENTIVES FOR THAT PROGRAM IT'S REALLY SORT OF THE WAY TO GO- WELL I THINK IT IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THAT THAT REALLY MEANS EFFECTIVELY THAT YOU WERE HAVING. QUITE A BIT HIGHER CARBON PRICES LIKELY AND SO YOU KNOW THERE ARE THINGS THAT YOU NEED TO THINK THROUGH ASSOCIATED WITH THAT BUT- I DON'T THINK IT'S NECESSARILY I HAVE THAT DIRECT EMISSION REDUCTIONS- ARE ARE NEEDED- OR KIND OF A- NON CAP AND TRADE RELATED POLICIES ARE NECESSARILY NEEDED TO MEET THE TWENTY THIRTY BILLS THERE'S ALSO THE OPTION OF. A CHANGES TO THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM. ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SEEN ON THANK YOU MISTER BROWN. I LIKE TO MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT BIGGER- DANI COLIN WARD HE IS THE POLICY DIRECTOR AT CARBON PLAN A NONPROFIT CLIMATE RESEARCH ORGANIZATION. AND ALSO THE VICE CHAIR OF THE- I IMAC. DR THANK YOU LORD. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN RICHARD THE PLEASURE TO BE HERE THANK YOU TO SENATOR BACKER AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AS WELL- I'M GONNA TOUCH ON A COUPLE OF ISSUES FOR THE AGENDA RELATED TO CARBON REMOVAL AND THE CONSTRUCTS OF CARBON NEUTRALITY- BEFORE I TOUCH ON THOSE MATTERS I WANT TO AFFIRM EVERYTHING I HEARD FROM DOCTOR BROWN- IN THE PREVIOUS DISCUSSION- THE FACT THAT. I THINK LET ME ACTUALLY EMPHASIZE WHAT HE SAID AND GO A STEP FURTHER IN IN MY PROFESSIONAL OPINION I'M VERY CONFIDENT WE ARE NOT ON TRACK TO THE TWENTY THIRTY TARGET THEM YOU NEED TO MAKE SUBSTANTIAL INCREASES IN OUR POLICY AMBITION TO BRING THAT ONLINE I THINK THAT'S ENTIRELY TECHNICALLY FEASIBLE IT ON THE COULD ANY CONCERNS ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO DO THAT AT THE CURRENT PACE OF PROGRESS IT'S NOT IN LINE WITH WHERE WE NEED TO GO. WE HAD A VERY GOOD YEAR IN THE EMISSION REDUCTIONS FROM THE CALENDAR YEAR TWENTY EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY NINETEEN WHICH IS THE MOST RECENT YEAR COMMISSIONS WE CUT ABOUT SEVEN MILLION TIMES THE MISSIONS WE NEED TO ABOUT DOUBLE THAT RATE- INSISTING THAT RATE EVERY SINGLE YEAR FROM- INCLUDING TWENTY TWENTY FORWARD IF WE'RE GONNA HIT R. TWENTY THIRTY TARGET. AND AS DR BROWN- MENTIONED AND CHAIRMAN BIRDS MENTIONED THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN SCOPING PLAN CALLS ON CAPITATE TO DELIVER ABOUT AFTER THE RESULTS- BY THE YEAR TWENTY THIRTY TO GET THAT JOB DONE IF YOU LOOK AT THE CUMULATIVE EFFORTS CARB FORECASTED IN ITS LAST OPEN PLAN THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM IN THE SHORT LIVED CLIMATE POLLUTANT PROGRAMS ARE MEANT TO ACCOMPLISH THAT THREE QUARTERS OF A CUMULATIVE PRODUCTIONS- I DON'T THINK WE'RE ON TRACK FOR THAT AND AS DR BROWN TOLD YOU. ALMOST ALL OF THE REDUCTIONS WE OBSERVE TODAY HAVE BEEN IN THE LECTURES THE SECTOR WHERE OTHER REGULATORY AGENCIES AND TECHNOLOGY CHANGES PLAYED A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN DRIVING THOSE OUTCOMES WE CANNOT RELY ON THOSE OUTCOMES AND OUR CONTINUED POLICY GOALS TO DECARBONIZE THE ELECTRICITY GRID TO GET TO TWENTY THIRTY LET ALONE. DEEPER TARGETS AROUND CARBON NEUTRALITY. WITH THAT- PRACTICE OF THE WAY I WANTED TO A LITTLE BIT ABOUT CARBON NEUTRALITY AND CONCEPT OF CARBON NEUTRALITY- AND IT'S- TO BE HONEST IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO TALK ABOUT THIS BECAUSE IT INVOLVES. OFTEN A LOT OF MAGICAL THINKING AND MAGICAL THINKING AROUND ISSUES THAT I THINK ARE HURTING. PEOPLE RIGHT NOW AND I JUST WANT TO TAKE NOTE OF THE FACT THAT. YOU KNOW. PEOPLE JUST EAST OF WHERE YOU ARE IN ELDORADO COUNTY HER BY PULLING FROM THEIR HOMES IS A MASSIVE WILDFIRE HAS ERUPTED YET ANOTHER. AND WE'RE HEADED INTO RED FLAG CONDITIONS- THIS IS A HUGE DEAL FOR. COMMUNITIES THAT ARE IMPACTED BY FAR IT'S A HUGE DEAL I'M PREPARING TO ROLL OUT MY AIR PURIFIERS BECAUSE THE ENTIRETY OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA IS ABOUT TO BE INUNDATED WITH PARTICULAR MATTER AS THE WIND SHIFTS- THIS IS A LIFE. RIGHT NOW. AND WHAT WE NEED TO DO AND TO THINK ABOUT TO GET TO CARBON NEUTRALITY WHICH IS HOW WE STOP ADDING PRESSURE TO MAKE THE CLIMATE PROBLEM WORSE. INVOLVES A LOT OF HARD WORK. AND OFTEN INVOLVES PEOPLE MAKING HER WROTE AND I'M JUSTIFIABLE ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO GET THE JOB DONE. PARTICULARLY WHEN IT COMES TO CARBON REMOVAL- I SAID THIS IS SOMEBODY THINKS. REMOVED IS GOING TO PLAY AN IMPORTANT. PART OF OUR OVERALL STRATEGY IN CALIFORNIA AND FRANKLY EVERYWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD IF WE'RE GOING TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM. BUT WE CANNOT INDULGE. IN MAGICAL THINKING TO GET THE JOB DONE. IT'S GOING TO TAKE DIFFICULT WORK TO GET TO THE CARBON NEUTRALITY GOAL PARTICULARLY BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE- I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF TECHNICAL WORK THAT SHOWS. HOW TO MAKE THE KINDS OF TRANSITIONS THAT ARE NEEDED. HOW YOU WOULD DO THAT HOW YOU WOULD IMPLEMENT THAT- I'M ENCOURAGED THE CARD IS PLANNING AND THINKING ABOUT THAT. AND I'M CONCERNED ABOUT TALKING ABOUT CARBON NEUTRALITY BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE WHEN WE ARE NOT ON TRACK FOR A 40% CUT AND REDUCTIONS LET ALONE SOMETHING CLOSER TO A 100% NOT CUT. I'M ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT THE EXTENT TO WHICH- PROMISES ABOUT THE FUTURE ROLE OF CARBON REMOVAL HAVE BEEN USED. IN CLIMATE POLICY CONVERSATIONS. INCLUDING THE PRIVATESECTOR TO DEFRAY THE NEEDED ACTION THAT IS NEEDED RIGHT NOW. AND I WANT TO BE VERY VERY CLEAR AND RAISING THESE CONCERNS I'M NOT SOMEBODY WHO SAYS CARBON REMOVAL SHOULD BE PART OF THE CONSIDERATION- I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT PART. OF WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO. BUT IF ONE WANTS TO BANK ON EXTENSIVE CARBON REMOVAL AS A GET OUT OF JAIL FREE CARD FOR REDUCING OUR EMISSIONS. WE'RE SETTING OURSELVES UP FOR SERIOUS PROBLEMS- I THINK. IT'S REALLY PART IN THESE CONVERSATIONS TO TALK ABOUT CARBON REMOVAL BECAUSE- IT MEANS SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS TO DIFFERENT PEOPLE- THE TYPICAL CATEGORIES WE SEE BROKEN DOWN WHEN PEOPLE TALK ABOUT CARBON REMOVAL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT ARE CALLED. ENGINEERED SOLUTIONS FOR YOU THINK ABOUT. CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE UNDERGROUND GEOLOGIC INJECTION MAYBE YOU'RE GONNA MINERALIZED CO TWO OUT OF THE ATMOSPHERE THROUGH CHEMISTRY- PEOPLE ALSO TALK ABOUT NATURAL CLIMATE SOLUTIONS ARE NATURAL CARBON REMOVAL- WHERE WE TALK ABOUT FORESTS AND SOILS SEQUESTER MORE CARBON. THESE ARE VERY DIFFERENT APPROACHES- AND THEY ALL HAVE MAJOR RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH% THEM THE RISKS ARE OFTEN COMPLETELY DISTINCT. AND REQUIRE VERY CAREFUL THOUGHT TO NOT. TOO HARD ON THE WRONG STRATEGY OR COMBINATION OF STRATEGIES. ENGINEER CARNIVAL IS VERY EASY TO MEASURE IT'S VERY EASY TO BE CONFIDENT IN THE OUTCOMES WHEN YOU BUILD A FACILITY TO- CARBON DIOXIDE INTO THE ATMOSPHERE THERE ARE SOME DEMONSTRATION FACILITIES THE DIFFERENCE. IT IS NOT HARD TO MEASURE IT IS VERY HARD TO GET COMFORTABLE WITH PARTICULARLY WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THESE TECHNOLOGIES. AND THE INCUMBENT FOSSIL FUEL INDUSTRIES- WHICH COULD POTENTIALLY BE SUPPORTED AND HAVE THEIR LIVES EXTENDED BY THESE APPROACHES DEPLOYED IN A CERTAIN WAY. AND WHICH COULD ALSO SEE THESE TECHNOLOGIES BECOME A SUSTAINABLE AND EQUITABLE PATHWAY FOR HIGH QUALITY JOBS TO BE MAINTAINED IN THE LOCATIONS IN COMMUNITIES WHERE THEY ARE CURRENTLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE FOSSIL ENERGY SYSTEM. NATURAL CARBON SOLUTIONS- ARE VERY EASY TO GET COMFORTABLE WITH PEOPLE LOVE FORESTS AND SOILS- IT'S EXTREMELY HARD TO MEASURE CARBON IN THE SYSTEMS IN FACT IT'S NOT REALLY BEING DONE WELL AT ALL WHEN IT COMES TO AGRICULTURAL OR SOIL CARBON. AND WHEN IT COMES TO FOREST CARBON WE ARE MUCH BETTER AT MEASURING IT WILL BE A VERY VERY CHALLENGED BY OUR ABILITY TO MAKE IT STAY PUT. AND ANYONE LIVING IN CALIFORNIA KNOWS WHAT THAT MEANS RIGHT NOW WITH THE FIRE SEASONS WE HAVE THIS YEAR AND LAST YEAR. THE WAY THE CALIFORNIA RESOURCES BOARD HAS MANAGE THESE ISSUES IN RELATED FOREST CLIMATE POLICIES INCLUDING A VERY PROMINENT ROLE FOR EXPORT CARBON FOREST CARBON OFFSETS. IS NOT AT ALL IN KEEPING WITH THE SCIENTIFIC UNDERSTANDING. OF THE THREAT OF FIRE OR ECOLOGICAL SYSTEM CHANGE TO FIRES FOR STARRING IN THE WESTERN UNITED STATES. I THINK IT'S GONNA BE VERY DIFFICULT TO GET OUR HEADS AROUND THESE THINGS EEN THOUGH IT'S VERY EASY TO SAY. WE LIKE TREES AND WE LIKE SOILS. AND LIKE HEALTHY FARMING PRACTICES. AND I ALL THE THINGS WE THESE TWO DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO CARBON REMOVAL HAVE THEIR OWN UNIQUE CHALLENGES AND IF WE- ASSUME WE ARE GOING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM. BY ANYONE OF THOSE WORKING OUT AT A VERY LARGE SCALE AND WE CHOOSE NOT TO TAKE SIGNIFICANT ACTION TO INCREASE OUR CLIMATE POLICY AMBITIONS. WE WILL GET NOW CLOSE. TO CARBON NEUTRALITY AND WE WILL WASTE OPPORTUNITIES TO MEANINGFULLY IMPROVE CALIFORNIANS LIVES IN THE INTERIM. I APOLOGIZE FOR THE TONE OF MY REMARKS BUT IT IS A VERY DIFFICULT THING TO LOOK FOR CLIMB THE PROBLEM SQUARE IN THE EYE AND TO. ACKNOWLEDGE THE GRAVITY OF WHAT IS HAPPENING AND WHAT IS REQUIRED TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEMS BEFORE US. AND IT IS DEEPLY FRUSTRATING AND- PAINFUL TO. PARTICIPATE IN CONVERSATIONS WHERE WE DO NOT SPEAK HONESTLY ABOUT WHAT IS REQUIRED. TO BEGIN TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS THAT ARE BEFORE US. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME AND LOOK FOR THE ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THAT THE COMMITTEE MIGHT HAVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH CALLING WORD. CENTER SKINNER. SO DOCTOR CONGER YOU APOLOGIZE FOR YOUR TOTAL BUT YOU KNOW I DON'T I APPRECIATE SOMEONE BEING FRANK HOWEVER. WHAT I. THE ENORMITY THE GRAVITY OF THE CRISIS YOU ARE BEING VERY FRANK ABOUT THE THEIR REALITY IN THE NECESSITY FOR THE TRANSITION OFF FOSSIL FUELS AS FAST AS WE CAN. FRANK HOWEVER I FEEL LIKE THE DISCUSSION AROUND THE CAPTURE OR THE SEQUESTRATION WITHIN. THE NATURAL SYSTEMS. YOU KNOW I GUESS I FEEL IT'S. I FELT YOUR VET CAVALIER BECAUSE I IN NO WAY WANT TO DIMINISH. THE ESSENTIAL OF THE OTHER AND DO NOT WANT A DIRECTION OR INACTION TOWARDS ANYTHING WITHIN OUR NATURAL ECOSYSTEMS TO BY ANY MEANS REPLACE OR TO BE THE DOMINANT STRATEGY. HOWEVER I. EIGHT I. D. I GUESS I QUESTION YOUR DESCRIPTION THAT THE SCIENCE AROUND THE CAPACITY OF BIOLOGICAL. PROSTHESES TO IT HAS THAT'S INEFFECTIVE WE LOOK AT THE CARBON CYCLE THAT'S WHAT THE CARBON CYCLE IS AND WHILE WE MAY NOT HAVE GOOD MEASURING TOOLS AND I AGREE WITH THAT AND CLEARLY AS OUR FORESTS BURNED OBVIOUSLY RELYING ON OUR FORESTS TO BE OUR CARBON CAPTURE IS INADEQUATE BUT THE CAPACITY OF. MICROORGANISMS WITHIN A VARIETY OF ECOSYSTEMS IS STRONG AND THERE ARE OTHER BENEFICIAL. OF BENEFITS TO THAT SO I GUESS. I WONDER IF YOUR ARE YOU BEING ASKED IN MY WORDS CAVALIER BECAUSE YOU'RE AFRAID THAT THAT THAT WE WOULD GO IN THAT DIRECTION AT THE EXPENSE OF THE FOSTER REDUCTIONS OR BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME SIGNS THAT I'M NOT SEEN. THANK YOU SENATOR SKINNER AND I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK FRANKLY- I THINK THE NATURE OF MY CONCERN IS PRIMARILY ONE THAT DEPENDING ON HOW WE SET UP OUR POLICY TARGETS WE COULD SUBSTITUTE. AWAY FROM DIRECT EMISSION REDUCTIONS BY ASSUMING WE WILL DELIVER LARGE VOLUMES OF CARBON REMOVAL THAT TURNS OUT NOT TO BE POSSIBLE IN THE WAYS WE HAD HOPED AN ANTICIPATED SO I DO WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT CONCERN AND I HEAR YOU SAYING THAT IT'S NOT FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU ARE ADVOCATING FOR- AND I DIDN'T MEAN TO SUGGEST OTHERWISE. HOW WE DEFINE CARBON NEUTRALITY AND WHETHER OR NOT WE REQUIRE A MINIMUM DIRECT EMISSION REDUCTION SPEAKS DIRECTLY TO THAT QUESTION AND ON THAT ISSUE I THINK. THE SCIENCE STRONGLY COUNSELS BEING RISK AVERSE ON THESE ISSUES AND BEING THOUGHTFUL AND CONSIDERATE ABOUT PUSHING FIRST AND FOREMOST ON DIRECT EMISSION REDUCTIONS AND I SAID THIS IS SOMEBODY WHO THINKS CARBON REMOVAL HAS AN IMPORTANT ROLE TO PLAY AND I DON'T WANT TO DIMINISH- THE MOTIVATIONS THAT- THAT HAD EVEN OTHERS BRING TO THAT CONVERSATION. YOU UNDERSTAND THE SCIENCE SIDE ACTUALLY THE SCIENCE IS INCREASINGLY CLEAR THAT THE RISKS FROM FIRE AND DROUGHT TO THE PROMINENCE OF FOREST NOT THE ABILITY OF TREES THE UPTAKE CARBON BUT THE ABILITY OF ECOSYSTEMS TO SUSTAIN IN THE FACE OF THE ECOLOGICAL CHANGE WE ARE OBSERVING WHICH IS ACCELERATING RAPIDLY. IT'S INCREASINGLY CLEAR THERE ARE PARTS OF CALIFORNIA THAT ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE FOREST BY THE END OF THE CENTURY THAT HISTORICALLY THROUGHOUT ALL OF OUR LIVES TO THE MEMORIES OF THE FAMILIES WHO MOVED HERE BEFORE. I'M OUT FOR US I THINK THAT'S ACTUALLY INCREASINGLY CLEAR AS A SCIENTIFIC FACT THAT IT'S VERY LIKELY TO HAPPEN SOME AREAS THE PRESSURES FROM THE CLIMATE SYSTEM ON THE FUNDAMENTAL DRIVERS OF FIRE RISK ARE INCREASING RAPIDLY AS THE CONCERN HERE IS NOT WHETHER NOT TREES UP TO CARMEN. IT'S HOW STABLE ARE OUR CURRENT LANDSCAPE PATTERNS AND THE WAY WE MANAGE THOSE LANDS ARE THE TRADE OFFS BETWEEN TRYING TO MANAGE FOR CARBON AND MANAGING FOR FIRE. AND IF WE PUT ALL OUR EGGS IN THE FOREST CARBON BASKET AND WE DO SO IN A WAY THAT SUBSTITUTES. AWAY FROM DIRECT EMISSION REDUCTIONS THAT I THINK IT'S SOMETHING AVOID. EVEN THOUGH I WHICH- AND WHO. WANTS TO CAREFULLY LOOK AT POTENTIAL INCLUDING THE CURRENT RISKS. WITH NATURAL CLIMATE SOLUTIONS I'M LOOKING AT WHAT WE CAN DO ON THAT FRONT. WITHOUT CLOSING OUR EYES TO. BE CLIMATE RISKS THAT ARE VERY MUCH IN FRONT OF US. FREESHEET CLARIFICATION THOUGH I DON'T THINK IT NECESSARILY ANSWER THE QUESTION IT REINFORCED THAT YOU DON'T WANT US WHICH I AGREE WITH TO RELY. NOT ONLY DOMINANT LEAD BUT EVEN WHATEVER TO HAVE ANY ILLUSION ABOUT. THE NECESSITY FOR THE ACTUAL REDUCTIONS- MEANING DIRECT EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS NOW HOWEVER I THINK THAT THE SCIENCE ON. THE CAPACITY OF THE CARBON CYCLE TO IF WE WERE- RESPECTING IT. GREATER THE CAPACITY FOR IT TO KEEP TO STORE CARBON IS STILL HIGH. THANKING CENTER BACKER. THANK YOU I GUESS. I'M MOVE AWAY FROM EITHER OR FROM AN EXTERNAL DON'T AS TO CENTER SKITTISH POINTED DIMINISH THE ABILITY OF AN ACTUAL WORKING LANDS TO SEQUESTER CARBON BUT- THIS CALL WOULD YOU BEEN OUTSPOKEN ABOUT THE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT OFFSETS WE'RE GRANTING. THAT REALLY HAVE A CLIMATE BENEFIT EQUIVALENT TO ALLOWING. POWER PLANT OR FACTORY TO MEET AN EXTRA. TEN OF CO TWO RIGHT OTHERWISE WERE ALLOWING. EXTRA POLLUTION WITHOUT TRULY GETTING OFFSETTING. THE BENEFITS SO CAN YOU ELABORATE ON SOME SITUATIONS IN WHICH- YOU ARE CONCERNED THESE OFFSETS ARE NOT. MEETING THAT STANDARD WE'RE GETTING A OFFSETTING BENEFITS. SURE I'LL BE HAPPY TO AND I WANT TO- BEFORE I DO THAT JUST MENTIONED THAT THE FRAMING OF CARBON OFFSETS FOR YOU ALLOW A POLLUTER TO CONTINUE POLLUTING IN RETURN FOR A PROMISE OF A REDUCTION ST IN A FOREST SYSTEM. IS THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT I HEARD SENATOR SKINNER ADVOCATE FOR WHAT WE'RE YOU'RE PURSUING IDEALLY BOTH STRATEGIES AT THE SAME TIME THIS IS AN EITHER OR SITUATION AND I THINK THAT'S THE CRUX OF THE PROBLEM. WITH THE OFFSETS PROGRAM TODAY THERE ARE A COUPLE DIFFERENT PROBLEMS IN THE OFFSETS PROGRAM I THINK THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF- I THINK VERY IMPORTANT INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALISM THAT IS DOCUMENTED SCENARIOS WHERE PEOPLE ARE CLAIMING CREDIT FOR BUSINESS AS USUAL ACTIVITIES. SO THEY'RE DOING THE SAME THINGS THEY WERE PLANNING TO DO THEY'RE NOW CLAIMING THAT THE THING THAT THEY WERE ALWAYS DOING IS A NEW CHANGE AND THEREFORE JUSTIFIES CREDITS THAT ALLOW FOR EXAMPLE A STATIONARY SOURCE REFINERY OF POWER PLANT TO INCREASE OR MAINTAIN ITS EMISSIONS. SO THIS PROBLEM OF NONTRADITIONAL CREDITING I THINK WHEN WE LOOK REALLY CAREFULLY THE SYSTEM TO FIND A LOT OF EVIDENCE THAT THAT PEOPLE ARE DOING BUSINESS AS USUAL ACTIVITIES AND CLAIMING THAT SOMETHING NEW- I WAS INVOLVED IN ON A LARGE SCALE STUDY THAT LOOKED AT ANOTHER QUESTION WHERE THE FUNDAMENTAL ACCOUNTING MECHANISMS BY WHICH- THE CREDITS ARE AWARDED IT CALIFORNIA'S CARBON OFFSETS SYSTEM. HI MY COLLEAGUES AND I THINK ARE INFLATING THE STATED CLIMATE REDUCTIONS BY ABOUT 30% FROM WHAT WE COULD SEE WITH WHETHER IT TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE AS THE FIRST INDEPENDENT AUDIT OF THE ENTIRE PROGRAM- WE ARE ALSO SEEING RIGHT NOW I THINK A CRISIS- STARTED IN A MOST VISIBLY LAST YEAR BUT IT'S BEEN AN ISSUE IN THE PROGRAM FOR SOME TIME WHERE. THE PREVALENCE OF FOREST FIRES IS RENDERING THAT PROMINENCE CLAIMS THAT THESE OFFSET PROJECTS ARE MAKING THAT THEY'RE GOING TO PROTECT AND STORE THE CARBON IN THE TREES. FOR AT LEAST A HUNDRED YEARS. I'M THAT IS NOT LOOKING LIKE A VERY SAFE THAT. I'M WE HAD A COUPLE OF FIRE IN THE LAST FEW YEARS. THE LIKE FIRE IN SOUTHERN OREGON VERY PROMINENTLY HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTING A LARGE PROJECT- CALLED PLYMOUTH EAST AND WE HAVE RIGHT NOW AN UNCONTROLLED FIRE BURNING IN ONE OF THE LARGEST PROJECTS. THE OFFSETS PROGRAM UP EASTERN WASHINGTON THE COCOA PROJECT- THE SCALE OF THE CARBON LOSSES THAT WE EXPECT FROM THE PROJECTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY ON FIRE AND IT RECENTLY BEEN ON FIRE ARE NOT AT ALL CONSISTENT. WITH THE PROTECTIONS THAT THE PROGRAM IS ANTICIPATED- FOR MAKING SURE THAT THE OVERALL INTEGRITY THE PROGRAM DELIVERS THOSE REAL CLIMATE BENEFITS. AND IT'S ALSO PRETTY CLEAR AT THIS POINT THAT THE PROGRAM IS NOT DESIGNED WITH EITHER CLIMATE RISKS IN MIND OR EVEN TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE FACT THAT. WESTERN FORESTS ARE MUCH MORE FIRE PRONE EASTERN FORESTS EVERYBODY FACES THE SAME SORT OF INSURANCE RISK PREMIUM. WHETHER THEY'RE LOCATED IN AN AREA THE PARENTS REGULARLY AND WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY KERN- AS AREAS OF EASTERN WASHINGTON SOUTHERN OREGON AND PARTS OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WILL IN OUR LIFETIMES. OR WHETHER THEY'RE LOCATED IN A IN A FAIRLY FIRE SAFE PLACE LIKE FOR EXAMPLE UPSTATE NEW YORK. OR VERMONT SO MR JUST THREE WISHES I COULD GO ON BUT I THINK THE OFFSETS PROGRAM IS AN EXAMPLE OF AN AREA WHERE WE HAVE- COLLECTIVELY. IN THE STATE EMPHASIZED. OUR FOR CLAIMING CLIMATE BENEFITS IN FORESTS AND THE SO CALLED NATURAL CLIMATE SOLUTIONS THAT HAVE DIVERTED ATTENTION AWAY FROM DIRECT EMISSION REDUCTIONS. THAT IS NOT THE ONLY WAY WE CAN PURSUE. ACTIVITIES IN THAT SPACE BUT IT IS THE WAY WE HAVE INVESTED SEVERAL BILLION DOLLARS SO FAR. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FOR ASSEMBLY MEMBER MAYES- DOCTOR CONGER THANK YOU- FOR YOUR FOR YOUR TIME TODAY AND I APPRECIATE THE INTENSITY- IN YOUR IN YOUR VOICE- AND I AND I KNOW IT CAN BE INCREDIBLY FRUSTRATING- THE AS AS WE ARE TRYING TO FIGURE ALL OF THIS OUT AFFECT IF IT'S OKAY- TO REPEAT SOMETHING IT SENATORS SKINNER SAID EARLIER TALKING ABOUT THAT SHE'D BEEN WORKING ON THIS- BEEN ALMOST TWENTY FIVE YEARS SINCE. SHE WAS EIGHT THAT KYOTO I KNOW IT'S A LOT OF PEOPLE TO WORK ON THIS FOR A VERY VERY LONG TIME AND EVEN THOUGH I HEAR THE INTENSITY IN YOUR VOICE- I DIDN'T HEAR A WHOLE LOT OF HOPE AND SO MAYBE I'M I'M I'M I'M WISHING THAT YOU WOULD PROVIDE MAYBE A LITTLE BIT OF HOPE- AND I WANT TO COME BACK TO THAT AND HAVE YOU ADDRESS IT. BUT WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT DIRECT EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS AND I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT AS A MEMBER BURKE WAS SAYING WE'RE TALKING ABOUT EQUITY THE FOLKS THAT LIVE IN IN MY DISTRICT IN- IN THE INLAND EMPIRE ASSEMBLY IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY AND THEY CAN AFFORD TO LIVE THERE THEY CAN AFFORD TO BUY HOMES THERE BUT FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD. A TO BUY HOMES THERE THEY HAVE TO GET IN THEIR CAR- WHICH ARE POLLUTERS A TO BE ABLE TO DRIVE INTO SAN DIEGO THE ORANGE COUNTY AND LA WHERE THEY WORK THEY CAN AFFORD TO LIVE IN THOSE COUNTIES SO THEY LIVE IN A MY TO COUNTIES AND THEN GET IN THEIR CAR AND THEY DRIVE A TWO TWO AND A HALF HOURS EVERY SINGLE DAY. A TO BE ABLE TO WORK AND THEY'RE POLLUTING THERE'S A COST FOR THAT THEY'VE MOVED OUT BECAUSE THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO LIVE IN THOSE IN THOSE OTHER COUNTIES AND SO THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE OF GETTING IN THEIR CAR AND THEIR- PUTTING GAS IN THEIR VEHICLES- AND THEY ARE POLLUTING BY DRIVING INTO THESE- IN THESE OTHER COUNTIES THIS IS THE QUESTION OF. OF EQUITY THAT COMES UP SO WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE DIRECT EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS A WHAT I HEAR IN THAT IS THAT IT'S GOING TO COST THE PEOPLE IN MY DISTRICT MORE MONEY TO BE ABLE TO SURVIVE TO BE ABLE TO LIVE. SOME OF US HAVE SOME HOPE WHEN WE HEAR OF FROM- THE- THERE'S TWO COMPANIES THAT I KNOW BECAUSE- WORKS AND CARBON ENGINEERING- THAT ARE. I'VE BEEN WORKING ON A DIRECT AIR CAPTURE- THE TECHNOLOGY MAYBE ISN'T. NECESSARILY THERE YET BUT IT LOOKS LIKE. THEY'RE ABLE TO SUCK STUFF OUT OF THE AREA BE ABLE TO REDUCE- OF THE CARBON IN IN THE ATMOSPHERE AND I THINK TO MYSELF. WHY ARE WE SPENDING AS MUCH MONEY AS WE POSSIBLY CAN IN TRYING TO SUCK THE CARBON DIRECTLY. OUT OF THE ATMOSPHERE BUT YOU ADDRESSED THAT A LITTLE BIT IN YOUR OPENING. A SUGGESTING THAT MAYBE THAT MIGHT BE OF A FAIRY TALE IF I HEARD YOU CORRECTLY THAT MIGHT THAT MIGHT BE. A FAIRY TALE OF THAT WE. BE ABLE. AND TO THINK THAT WAS. THE ANSWER SO I GUESS THE ONE. IS IS THE HOPE. WHAT WE DO HAVE WE HAVE A- ECONOMY AT THE SAME TIME. A RETREAT. THIS NEGATIVE EXTERNALITY- AND- AND SOLVE THIS CRISIS. I THINK THAT THE FIRST ANSWER YOUR QUESTION IS BY HAVING AN HONEST CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON THAT INCLUDES THE EQUITY CONSIDERATIONS INCLUDING GEOGRAPHIC CONSIDERATIONS THAT. THAT I HEARD FROM BOTH YOU. AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER BURKE- TWO THINGS TO SAY. ONE I'M ACTUALLY ACTUALLY ON THE VERY OPTIMISTIC SIDE OF THE DIRECTOR CAPTURE SPECTRUM. I THINK THERE'S SOME REALLY INTERESTING STUFF GOING ON AND IT COULD POTENTIALLY BE A SIGNIFICANT PART OF THE WAY WE TACKLE THESE PROBLEMS- YOU ARE NOT. I DON'T THINK GOING TO BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN. THE CURRENT. STATUS AND STRUCTURE OF HOW. WE DRIVE CARS AND THE KINDS OF CARS WE DRIVE IT'S NOT SUSTAINABLE IN THE LONG RUN- SO DIRECTOR CAPTURES IN THE QUESTION OF WHETHER OR NOT WE HAVE TO COME UP WITH THE FOUR DOUBLE AN EQUITABLE SOLUTIONS BOTH TO HOUSING AND THE TRANSPORTATION COSTS THAT YOU SITE. BUT IT COULD BE A BIG PART OF WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO. THE PROBLEM IS YOU HAVE LIKE TWO DEMONSTRATION FACILITIES IN ICELAND RIGHT NOW AND MOST OF THE DEPLOYMENT THAT IS BEING CONSIDERED. TO TEST THESE SYSTEMS AT SCALE. IS ABOUT PRODUCING MORE OIL AND GAS RATHER THAN DIRECTLY SEQUESTERING CO TWO AN UNDERGROUND STORAGE RESERVOIRS MOUNTED ON THE GAS PRODUCTION PURPOSE. SO I COULDN'T BE MORE OPTIMISTIC WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH COMPANIES. THAT ARE THINKING ABOUT INVESTING IN THESE ISSUES. AND WORKING SPECIFICALLY WITH THE COMPANIES YOU MENTIONED THERE'S A LOT OF GOOD STUFF HAPPENING- THAT IS NOT AN ANSWER. TO THE QUESTION OF HOW WE HANDLE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR EMISSIONS. SO IN LAST FOR OTHER ISSUES OKAY. AGAIN THE BIG EXASPERATION HEARING IS IF WE INDULGE IN FANTASY THINKING WE WILL SCREW THIS UP. BUT I HOPE SENATOR SKINNER REMEMBER ME WHICH SHE BEGAN. HER INNOVATIVE ADVOCACY. WELL BEFORE HER TIME IN THE LEGISLATURE. I THINK ANYBODY THOUGHT RENEWABLES ARE GOING TO BE AS CHEAP AS THEY ARE. IT IS REMARKABLE HOW QUICKLY THE ELECTRICITY SECTOR HAS STARTED TO MOVE. ON RENEWABLE ENERGY AND I THINK STORAGE. AND THE PACE OF ELECTRIC VEHICLE INNOVATION IS JUST OUT OF CONTROL IN A POSITIVE WAY THAT- MY GREAT HOPE IS THAT. IN A FEW YEARS WE WILL BE HAVING A CONVERSATION ABOUT. WHETHER OR NOT THERE ARE EFFORT. YOUR COST BARRIERS FOR FOLKS WHO ARE LIVING FAR AWAY FROM CENTERS TO DOCTOR. THE BE SHORT. IN OUR- TO GET ENOUGH KERR TO PEOPLE AS QUICKLY AS THEY WANT THEM- THAT'S HOPE. AND I AM REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THE ELECTRICITY SYSTEM AND THE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM IN THE MEDIUM TERM. WHAT I'M WORRIED ABOUT IS. TALKING ABOUT. THE IDEA THAT WE ARE ON TRACK FOR CUTTING OR POLLUTION BY 40% IN THE NEXT TEN YEARS WITHOUT STEPPING UP THE PACE OF MEDICATION POLICIES- AND I'M I'M WORRIED IF WE DON'T HAVE HONEST CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THESE THINGS. WE WON'T BE ABLE TO BALANCE THE EQUITY AND GEOGRAPHIC CONSIDERATIONS THAT HAVE TO BE A PART OF THIS LONG TERM THINKING. SO PLEASED TO HEAR ME AS SOMEBODY WHO IS DEEPLY OPTIMISTIC ABOUT SOME INCREDIBLY CONCERNED ABOUT. THE MAGICAL THINKING THAT I SEE- IN MANY CONVERSATIONS NOT EXCLUSIVE TO THE CALIFORNIA POLICY SITUATION BUT DEFINITELY PRESENT HERE AS WELL. GENERALITY I LOVE TO GET YOUR PERSONAL THINGS AGAIN I I'VE GOTTEN A CHANCE TO HEAR YOUR THOUGHTS AS THEY'VE EVOLVED OVER THE YEARS AND I ALWAYS APPRECIATE YOUR CANDOR AND- AND REAL TALK- I LOVE TO GET YOUR THOUGHTS. ON THE- EVER EVOLVING DISCUSSION OVER THE EXTENT TO WHICH WE REALLY- DOUBLE DOWN ON ELECTRIFICATION VERSUS OTHER ALTERNATIVE FUELS AND THAT'S OBVIOUSLY A BIG BATTLE THAT THAT TAKES PLACE HERE- YOU KNOW MONKS AMONGST PEOPLE WHO ARE PUSHING FOR EVERYTHING FROM HYDROGEN TO. NATURAL GAS AND IT'S AFTER. SENATOR ARE YOU ASKING WITH RESPECT TO THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR ADVERTISING SECTOR I'M SORRY. I THINK THERE ARE OTHERS WHO ARE PROBABLY. HAVE DEEPER EXPERTISE ON THIS ISSUE WHEN I TO WHO ARE SERIOUS EXPERT IN THE SPACE. I DON'T. MUCH INTO THE FOR NOW ELECT STRATEGY IN THE DUTY ARE AND I HEAR A ROBE DEBATE. FOR HAVING VEHICLE BEEN TRY SPACE AND- I AM NOT ENOUGH OF THE EXPERT TO SAVE YOU. I'M TO PUT MY FINGER IN THE AIR ANSWERED GASSET THAT'S ALL GOING TO GO THE FALLING COST OF BATTERIES AND THE RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS THAT SPACE HAS OPENED UP POSSIBILITIES THAT SEEMED. LESS LIKELY A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO- I'M ALSO WATCHING CAREFULLY I THINK. YOU KNOW IF WE WATCH CAREFULLY CONVERSATIONS IN EUROPE AND THE UNITED KINGDOM FOCUS MORE ON HYDROGEN IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE LONG TERM DECARBONISATION BY THAN WE HAVE THUS FAR TALKED ABOUT IN CALIFORNIA- I TRY TO BE AGNOSTIC ABOUT THESE THINGS BUT- THE- MAIN MESSAGE I'M HEARING FROM COLLEAGUES WHO. CONCENTRATE ON THE CERES THAT LIGHT DUTY VEHICLES THE CARS AND TRUCKS THAT REGULAR PEOPLE DRIVE. THE ELECTRIC DRIVE TRAIN IS WHERE THE ACTION IS GOING TO BE THERE. AND WHEN YOU MOVE INTO THE HAVE YOUR TUTOR DUTY VEHICLES THERE ARE. ROBUST DEBATES ABOUT THE EXACT PATH FORWARD. BUT WHEN YOU SEE CRAZY THINGS LIKE PEOPLE FIGURED OUT HOW TO ELECTRIFY YOU KNOW. LIKE SHIPPING BARGES LIKE SOME OF THE BARGE BASED TRANSPORTATION ON THE OCEANS LIKE PEOPLE ARE ELECTRIFYING THINGS THAT. DID NOT SEEM POSSIBLE SEVERAL YEARS AGO AND IT'S JUST IT'S FASCINATING TO WATCH. THE DEGREE TO WHICH GIVE LIKE- YOU YOU COULD TURN THAT INTO AN ELECTRIC APPLICATIONS WELL THAT SEEMS TO BE PLAYING OUT IN PLACES. TEN YEARS AGO I NEVER WOULD HAVE IMAGINED. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU SEEING NO FURTHER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH DR COLIN WARD. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. LAST BIGGER ON THIS PANEL IS- DR MEREDITH VALLEY SHE IS AN ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR AT UC BERKELEY- FIRST VALLEY. THANK YOU CAN YOU HEAR ME OK YES THANK YOU GREAT THANK YOU AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE PART OF THIS CONVERSATION I AM A UC BERKELEY ECONOMIST HYMAN DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE RESOURCE ECONOMICS AND FACULTY DIRECTOR OF THE ENERGY IS CHEATED HAAS SO MY EXPERTISE- THIS IS RELATIVELY NARROW- LOOKING AT- THE ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECONOMIC REGULATION OF ENERGY MARKETS. AND GIVEN THE URGENCY OF THE CLIMATE CHANGE PROBLEM I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT TODAY'S SESSION IS NOT ASKING WHETHER CALIFORNIA SHOULD ACT BUT WHAT PATH TO TAKE WHICH POLICY LEVERS TO PULL. AND HOW SWIFTLY TO MOVE THE WORLD'S FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY ONTO A MORE SUSTAINABLE PATH. IT'S LATE AND I KNOW I'VE MY TIME IS LIMITED SO I'M JUST GOING TO TRY AND MAKE THREE POINTS ALL STATE THEM UP FRONT AND THEN. EXPAND AS TIME PERMITS SO THE FIRST POINT IS THAT CALIFORNIA'S NET ZERO GOAL IS A MEANS TO AN END NOT AN END TO ITSELF AND I KNOW WHO THE COMMITTEE APPRECIATE FAST BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN MIND THAT OUR GUIDING PRINCIPLE. SHOULD BE TO INNOVATE AND DEMONSTRATE- TECHNOLOGY THE POLICIES THAT CAN BE EXPORTED TO OTHER JURISDICTIONS FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF PROJECTED TO FUTURE GREENHOUSE GASES ARE ARE EXPECTED TO HAPPEN. MY SECOND POINT IS THAT IT'S NOT JUST WHAT WE DO BUT HOW WE DO IT THAT MATTERS SO IN PARTICULAR IF WE WANT TO ENSURE A CLEAN ENERGY TRANSITION THAT EQUITABLE AND AFFORDABLE. WE NEED INNOVATION ACROSS THE BOARDS OF COURSE WE NEED NEW TECHNOLOGIES WE NEED INFRASTRUCTURE MODERNIZATION BUT IT'S ALSO GOING TO REQUIRE REINVENTING THE INSTITUTIONAL AND REGULATORY STRUCTURES. THAT GUIDE WHICH INVESTMENTS WE MAKE HOW WE PAY FOR THEM AND WHO ULTIMATELY PAYS THE PRICE. AND FINALLY- AND THIS IS PICKING UP ANYTHING THAT'S COME UP ALREADY THERE'S A TEMPTATION TO MANDATE OUR WAY TO THE ZERO CARBON- AND THIS COULD UNDERMINE- THE ROLE OF CALIFORNIA'S CARBON MARKET IN THE COST EFFECTIVENESS IT BRINGS WE DON'T KNOW THE PATH FROM HERE TO THERE. THAT'S GOING TO DEPEND ON INNOVATION AND TO BE DETERMINED ADVANCES AND SO AN IMPORTANT ADVANTAGE OF A CARBON MARKET IS IT PROVIDES A WAY TO INCENTIVIZE THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE- MEASURES WITHOUT REALLY KNOWING WHERE OR- HOW THEY CAN THAT. THEY. CAN MANIFEST OR CAN BE FOUND. SO FIRST POINT. IN THE PROJECTIONS ARE THAT GLOBAL GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS ARE GOING TO REACH SIXTY FIVE GIGA TONNES UNDER BUSINESS AS USUAL BY TWENTY THIRTY. OUR CALIFORNIA INVENTORY IS ESTIMATING TWENTY NINETEEN GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AT JUST OVER POINT FOUR GIGA TONS SO. EVEN IF WE ZERO OUT OUR CALIFORNIA EMISSIONS WOULD REDUCE PROJECTED GLOBAL GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS BY. POINT SEVEN PERCENT. AND THIS IS NOT TO SUGGEST THAT CALIFORNIA'S DECARBONIZATION EFFORTS ARE FEW TILE BUT RATHER TO UNDERSCORE THE FACT. THAT THE REASON WE'RE HERE TODAY IS TO MOVE THE GLOBAL BALL FORWARD. NEVER GOING TO MAKE A DENT IN THE CLIMATE CHANGE PROBLEM IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN THROUGH LEADERSHIP AND DEMONSTRATING THE MOST PROMISING CLIMATE SOLUTIONS. SO THIS IS TRUE FOR TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION AND MANY FIRMS IN CALIFORNIA ARE WELL. POSITIONED TO CAPITALIZE ON THAT SO IN THAT RESPECT I THINK INCENTIVES ARE RELATIVELY WELL ALIGNED. BUT IT'S ALSO TRUE FOR POLICY INNOVATION. AND I THINK IN SOME CASES THERE WILL BE TENSIONS BETWEEN THE PURSUIT A VERY AMBITIOUS STATE LEVEL TARGETS. AND FOCUSED EFFORTS TO CRAFTING DEMONSTRATE MODELS THEY CAN BE EXPORTED ELSEWHERE AND SO WHEN THAT WHERE THOSE TENSIONS ARISE I HOPE WE PRIORITIZE THE LATTER. I ALSO WANT TO PICK UP ON AN IMPORTANT POINT THAT ROSS BROWN MADE- IF WE WANT TO MAXIMIZE THE GLOBAL IMPACT OF OUR CLIMATE POLICY INNOVATION. WE SHOULD BE DOING MORE TO EXTRACT UNDERSTAND LESSONS THAT WE'RE LEARNING BY DOING SO OTHERS CAN FOLLOW- SO ROSS BROWN MADE REALLY ARTICULATE ARGUMENTS ALONG THOSE LINES I WANT TO ALSO DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT THERE'S PRECEDENT FOR DOING THIS DELIBERATELY AND EFFECTIVELY. SO QUICK EXAMPLE BACK IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN THE FEDERAL RECOVERY ACT INCLUDED BILLIONS. IN MATCHING FUNDS TO ACCELERATES MARKET INVESTMENTS. RECOGNIZING THAT THIS PRESENTED AN OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY LEARN ABOUT WHAT INVESTMENTS WORK IN WHICH FALL SHORT. THEY DO YOU REQUIRED GRANT RECIPIENTS DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT PROGRAM ABOUT AERATION PLANS THAT MET PREDETERMINED CRITERIA. SO I WAS FORTUNATE TO WORK WITH SMART ON THERE FROM INTO SMART GRID ELECT PRICE PROGRAM. AND THAT'S ABA. TO THINK ABOUT EVALUATION AS WE DESIGNED THE PROGRAMS MEANT THAT ONCE THE PROGRAMS ARE UP AND RUNNING WE HAD WHAT WE NEEDED TO RIGOROUSLY STUDY WHAT WAS WORKING AND WHAT WAS FALLING SHORT OF EXPECTATIONS. AND FINDINGS FROM THOSE STUDIES HAVE SINCE INFORMED AND SHAPED CQC'S DECISIONS INCLUDING SOME RECENT DECISIONS WHICH WILL REDUCE THE COST OF INTEGRATING HIGHER LEVELS OF RENEWABLE GENERATION. SO I SOME I THINK THAT CALIFORNIA'S POLICY EXPERIMENTATION CAN HAVE A GLOBAL IMPACT BUT TO REALIZE THAT POTENTIAL WE NEED TO FOCUS ON EXPORTABLE SOLUTIONS. AND IDEALLY INVEST MORE IN UNDERSTANDING HOW THIS EXPERIMENTATION IS WORKING. THE SECOND POINT I WANT TO MAKE I THINK IS REALLY IMPORTANT AND IF WE TAKE ONE AWAY FROM HIM FROM THE CENTER AND THINGS COME UP THAT I HOPE WITH THIS ONE. IT'S ABOUT THE NEED FOR ENERGY SECTOR REFORM SO IT'S REALLY EXCITING TO THINK ABOUT THE NEW TECHNOLOGIES WE CAN DEPLOY. AND THE STEPS WE CAN TAKE TO FIGHT CLIMATE CHANGE SOMEWHAT LESS EXCITING WESTERN ECONOMIST- BUT NO LESS IMPORTANT IS TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE PAY FOR ALL THIS. SO HOW WE FUND OUR CLIMATE AMBITION IS GOING TO DETERMINE WHAT IT COST AND WHO PAYS THE PRICE. AND TO ELUCIDATE THIS POINT I WANT TO DRAW FROM SOME WORK I'M DOING WITH AND ENERGY INSTITUTE COLLEAGUES THAT INVESTIGATES WHY CALIFORNIA'S REGULATED RETAIL ELECTRICITY PRICES. SO THE PRICE WE ALL PAY PER KILOWATT HOUR FOR ELECTRICITY FROM THE GRID. OUR HIGH AND INCREASINGLY ALIGNED WITH THE REST OF THE COUNTRY HAS THE ANSWERS HAVE IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS FOR THE CONVERSATION WE'RE HAVING TODAY. SO IF ECONOMY WITH OR DOES ELECTRO PRICES. I WOULD SET THE PRICE PER KILOWATT HOUR TO REFLECT THE MARGINAL SOCIAL COST OF CONSUMING ELECTRICITY SO WHEN I RUN MY DISHWASHER AND CONSUME A KILOWATT HOUR OF ELECTRICITY. THE PRICE TO REFLECT THE COST OF THE FUEL AND THE CLIMATE COST OF THAT INCREMENTAL CONSUMPTION. BUT WHAT WE'RE SHOWING IN OUR WORK IS THAT THE MARGINAL SOCIAL COST IS ARE EFFICIENT PRICE BENCHMARK FOR ELECTRICITY IF YOU WELL. HAS BEEN DECLINING IN CALIFORNIA HAS OUR GREAT GETS CLEANER SO WE'RE ESTIMATING THAT IN TWENTY NINETEEN. THIS EFFICIENT PRICES ABOUT EIGHT TO TEN CENTS PER KILOWATT HOUR. BUT THE RETAIL PRICES WERE PAYING ARE MUCH HIGHER SO IN MY TERRITORY. MOST CUSTOMERS PAY ABOUT THREE TIMES THAT. LOW INCOME CUSTOMERS WHO QUALIFY FOR THE CARE RATE HE TWO TIMES THAT EFFICIENT PRICE. AND THE REASON WE'RE PAYING AND EFFICIENTLY HYLEK CHRISTY PRICES. IF CALIFORNIA HAS A PRACTICE OF. SB CONSUMPTION TO THE REVENUES WE REALLY NEED FOR INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS AND GRID MODERNIZATION AND WILDFIRE ADAPTATION. AND ROOFTOP SOLAR SUBSIDIES THE LIST GOES ON. WE HAVE A LOT OF THESE EXPENSES. PARTLY PREVENT MITIGATE CLIMATE CHANGE. PARTLY BECAUSE WE'RE TRYING TO ADAPT TO CLIMATE CHANGE. THESE COSTS ARE ONLY GOING TO ESCALATE. AND SO HERE'S MY KEY POINT RECOVERING THESE COSTS IN ELECTRICITY RATES TAXING ELECTRICITY CONSUMPTION IS PROBLEMATIC FOR TWO REASONS. ONE AS WE'VE DISCUSSED ELECTRIFICATION IS A KEY TO THE DECARBONISATION. HI ELECTRICITY PRICES ARE GONNA SLOW PROGRESS ON ELECTRIFICATION. SO IN CARP SCOPES OUT THAT WE NEED X. PERCENT OF ELECTRIC CARS BY TWENTY THIRTY. WE NEED DRIVERS TO CHOOSE TO GET INTO ELECTRIC CARS AND RESEARCH SHOWS THAT IT'S MUCH HARDER. TO PROMOTE ELECTRIFICATION WHEN ELECTRICITY PRICES ARE HIGH AND RISING. AND THE SECOND REASON TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT A TAX ON ELECTRICITY CONSUMPTION IS ONE OF THE MOST REGRESSIVE TAXES WE CAN THINK OF. BECAUSE LOW INCOME. THIS IS MARCUS OF THAT GAS TAX A SALES TAX MUCH MORE AGGRESSIVE THAN IN INCOME TAX. SO WE'RE THINKING ABOUT DECARBONISING THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY IT'S CLEAR WE NEED TO REVOLUTIONIZE HOW WE GENERATE ELECTRICITY AND PUBLIC TRANSPORT ELECTRICITY AND HOW WE CONSUME ELECTRICITY. BUT WE ALSO NEED TO RETHINK HOW WE PAY FOR ELECTRICITY FOR BOTH EQUITY AND EFFICIENCY REASONS. I KNOW I'M AT A TIME LET ME MAKE MY FINAL POINT BRIEFLY WE'VE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT THIS. BUT WITH RESPECT TO THE CARBON MARKET CARBON PRICING IS NOT A SILVER BULLET BUT IT'S AN ESSENTIAL PIECE OF CALIFORNIA'S CLIMATE CHANGE POLICIES. SO WE HAVEN'T PLACED AN ECONOMY WIDE CARBON MARKET WHICH ENSURES THAT SOME PART I'D LIKE TO SEE THE PRICE BE HIGHER BUT SOME PART OF THE COST OF EMITTING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. IS TRANSMITTED IN THE FORM OF A CARBON PRICE ALMOST EVERYWHERE. CARBON IS IMPLICITLY BOUGHT AND SOLD SERVICE PROVIDES AN INCENTIVE. FOR AGENTS TO INTERNALIZE PART OF THE CLIMATE COST. IF WE RELY PRIMARILY ON MANDATES AND STANDARDS AND SUBSIDIES TO ACHIEVE OUR FUTURE TARGETS WILL DEPRESSOR DILUTE THIS CARBON PRICING ALSO I THINK THERE'S A BALANCE TO STRIKE. BETWEEN RELYING ON THE CARBON MARKET VERSUS PRESCRIPTIVE REGULATIONS TO GET WHERE WE NEED TO GO. SO I'VE ONLY SCRATCHED THE SURFACE I'M WAY OVER TIME I WILL CLOSE BY SAYING THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF RESEARCHERS STUDENTS AND FACULTY. AT UC BERKELEY DOING RESEARCH RELEVANT TO THE THREE THINGS I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT. AN IMPORTANT MOTIVATION THIS WORK IS TO INFORM HIGH STAKES POLICY DECISIONS SO PLEASE DO NOT HESITATE TO FOLLOW UP WITH ME. IF ANY OF THE COMMENTS I MADE PEAK YOUR INTEREST BECAUSE WE'D WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY TO ENGAGE. FURTHER AND I'LL STOP THERE. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. A FELL. I'M SURE EACH OF. TOUCHED UPON WHAT YOU NORMALLY CALL A COVER AN ENTIRE SEMESTER'S OUR TEXTBOOKS. ABOUT WE APPRECIATE THE- THE HIGHLIGHTS ANY. QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. IS YOUR ARE YOU OR YOUR GROUP PLANNING ANY- BASED ON YOUR RESEARCH ANY REPORTS ON A POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS AROUND ELECTRICITY PRICING CALIFORNIA. YEAH SO WE- WROTE A QUICK SURVEY- ONE REPORTER PRELIMINARY REPORT THAT WAS PARTLY SUPPORTED BY NEXT TEN WHICH WE RELEASED A LAST SPRING IN ORDER TO TRAIN INFORM THE POLICY DISCUSSION AS IT UNFOLDED BUT THIS WORK IS I'M GOING SO THEY'LL BE A SUBSEQUENT REPORT COMING OUT IN THE FALL AND PROBABLY MORE TO FOLLOW. BUT I'D BE HAPPY TO SHARE THE REPORT WITH YOU- THAT WE HAVE. THAT'S ALREADY OUT- IN FUTURE REPORTS AS THEY BECOME AVAILABLE. THAT WOULD BE GREAT. SEND IT TO THE FOLKS THAT CONTACTED YOU TO ARRANGE FOR YEP BECAME HAPPY TO DO THAT AND HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS WE CAN. DEFINITELY YOU YOU TALKED ABOUT HOW YOU KNOW WE NEED TO KEEP A- VIA THE PROPER PERSPECTIVE ON ON CALIFORNIA'S. ROLE WHICH IS TRYING TO MAXIMIZE THE GLOBAL IMPACT ON ON ON CLIMATE CHANGE- GIVEN OUR- YOU KNOW A FRACTION OF OUR GLOBAL CONTRIBUTION TO THE GREENHOUSE GAS GASES IT AND I AND OUR LARGER POTENTIAL TO BE ABLE TO INNOVATE AND EXPORT EXPORT. TO- IN A GAME CHANGING- TECHNOLOGY- DO YOU HAVE ANY ANY TOPLINE RECOMMENDATIONS IN TERMS OF HOW. THE LEGISLATURE CAN BEST INCENTIVIZE THOSE TYPE OF- INNOVATIONS. YEAH I MEAN GENERALLY SPEAKING- I'VE BEEN TRYING TO THINK ABOUT SOMETHING MORE CONCRETE I CAN OPERATE BECAUSE I THINK IT'S A REALLY GOOD QUESTION- I DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT PUSHING TOO QUICKLY TOWARDS GOALS THAT WE NEED TO REACH AT SOME POINT MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE COST OF THAT LAST 23% REDUCTIONS ARE GOING TO BE QUITE HIGH GIVEN THE TECHNOLOGIES WE ALREADY HAVE IN HAND TODAY BUT THAT THOSE COSTS COULD FALL AS TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION PROCEED TO PAY SO- I GUESS STRIKING A BALANCE BETWEEN DOING IT BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE AT GRAPHIC OFTEN POTENTIALLY. IMPACTED PARTICULARLY TO LOWER INCOME CALIFORNIANS OF VERSES US ARE MORE MEASURED APPROACH OF THINKS ABOUT ALL THE INNOVATIONS IN THE CHILLING WE'RE GONNA NEED TO MAKE FROM THE INFRASTRUCTURE FROM THE TECHNOLOGY TO THE INSTITUTIONS AND REGULATIONS SO WE CAN DEMONSTRATE A SYSTEMIC OUT SET OF POLICY INTERVENTIONS AND AN INCENTIVE THAT WE NEED TO GET THERE SO I THINK IT'S JUST THINKING ABOUT WHY WE'RE DOING IT AND WHETHER- PUSHING HARD AT GREAT COST TO HIT A TARGET I'M IN CALIFORNIA WHAT THAT DEMONSTRATES THE WORLD CLASS VERSUS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE VARIOUS CHALLENGES THAT WE'RE GONNA NEED TO MAKE TO MAKE SURE THE EFFORT OF THAT THE TRANSITION. IS EQUITABLE AND SUSTAINABLE AND AFFORDABLE. ASSEMBLY ONE BURKE YEAH ON THE CHAIRS QUESTION ABOUT OUR ROLE AS A LEADER AND- I APPRECIATE THE LAST THING YOU JUST SAID BECAUSEYOU DID MENTION THAT. YOU KNOW A LOT OF THE THINGS ARE AGGRESSIVE A LOT OF. OPPORTUNITIES WE'RE TAKING OUR OUR REGRESSIVE AND- I AM CURIOUS WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ARE ON WHAT OUR RESPONSIBILITY. IS AS A LEADER TO SHOW THAT ALL COMMUNITIES COME ALONG ON THIS JOURNEY- TWO OF OUR NINE PANELISTS ARE. PEOPLE OF COLOR. AND SO I AM CURIOUS WHAT WHAT YOU THINK OUR ROLE AS LEADERS IS. IS IN NOT ANY OF OUR IN THE SPACE- NOT OBVIOUSLY JUST TO EACH OTHER BUT TO THE WORLD. I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR QUESTION- SO I GUESS ONE THING THAT I DIDN'T GET A CHANCE TO GET INTO DO AS I THINK I WANNA- MAKE CLEAR THAT. THE WHAT I SEE IS THE PROMISE SPECIALLY IN THE ELECTRICITY IN THE CASE OF ELECTRICITY IS NOT NOT NECESSARILY INVESTMENTS WERE MAKING BUT HOW WE'RE PAYING FOR THEM. SO FOR EXAMPLE IN OUR REPORT WE TALK ABOUT HOW AND INCREASED INCOME TAX WOULD BE FAR LESS REGRESSIVE YOU WOULD WRITE RECOVER THE REVENUES WE NEED TO COVER THESE COSTS BUT IN A FAR LESS AGGRESSIVE WAY. AND IN A MORE EFFICIENT WAY TO THE EXTENT THAT ALLOWS US TO REDUCE ELECTRICITY PRICES CLOSER TO WHERE EFFICIENT PRICE WOULD BE. I SEE AND WE HAVE BEEN ARGUING AS PART OF THE PROJECT I MENTIONED THAT WE DO HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO DEMONSTRATE LEADERSHIP NOT ONLY IN TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. BUT ALSO IN DEMONSTRATING HOW YOU DEPLOY THESE TECHNOLOGIES AND HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THIS TRANSITION IN AN EQUITABLE AND AFFORDABLE WAY SO I DO SEE. AND I'D BE HAPPY TO TALK FURTHER WE TALKED ABOUT INCOME BASED FIXED CHARGES THERE ARE NUMBER OF DEGREES OF FREEDOM WE HAVE AND WE'RE TRYING TO RAISE THE REVENUES TO COVER THESE INVESTMENTS IN COSTS. THAT STRIKES A BETTER BALANCE BETWEEN CLIMATE CHANGE ACTION WE NEED TO MAKE. ANY EQUITY. EQUITY AND AFFORDABILITY CONCERNS. THAT SHOULD BE TOP OF MIND IN MY OPINION. I APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU JUST REAL QUICK I THINK YOU YOU SAID THIS BUT DO YOU BELIEVE. A CURRENT CAPTURE MARKET PRICES ARE PLANNING A STRONG ENOUGH. PRICE SIGNAL RELATIVE TO THE PACE OF CHANGE WE NEED. NOW YEAH. I THINK THEY NEED TO BE HIGHER AND I THINK ONE THING TO. TO AT RUNS AND BROWN AND HIS COLLEAGUES HAVE DONE EXCELLENT WORK AND IF HE ARTICULATED IT CAN BE HARD TO UNDERSTAND THE MARGINAL. IMPLICIT COSTS WERE PAYING FOR OTHER MEASURES BUT I THINK THE BULK OF THE EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT. YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE PAYING PER TON OF CARBON REDUCE BY SOME OF OUR MANDATES MORE PRESCRIPTIVE REGULATIONS AS WELL ABOVE THE PRICE WE'RE SEEING. IN THE MARKET WHICH SUGGESTS THAT THERE COULD BE. RELATIVELY COST EFFECTIVE CARBON REDUCTION OPTIONS AND MEASURES THAT WE'RE NOT DEPLOYING THAT COULD BE DEPLOYED BEFORE HIGHER STRONGER CARBON PRICE SIGNAL. THANK ALL RIGHT SAYING NO FURTHER QUESTIONS THANK YOU VERY MUCH JEFF VALLEY. THANK YOU. THIS CONCLUDES OUR OUR SECOND PANEL AREN'T AREN'T EARLY NEXT AND FINAL PANEL IS GOING TO BE A- AN OPPORTUNITY TO HEAR FROM A WIDE RANGE OF STAKEHOLDERS WHERE WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE A THE QUESTIONS WE'RE GOING TO RESERVE THE QUESTIONS FOR THE NEXT PASS A PANEL- AS AS A GROUP AFTER ALL. FIVE HAVE HAD A CHANCE TO PRESENT AND SO- WE ARE WANT TO WELCOME- PAULINA TORRANCE STAFF ATTORNEY FOR THE SENATE RACE POVERTY AND ENVIRONMENT- THEN FOLLOWING HER ANDREW MEREDITH THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA REGIONAL DIRECTOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL- THIRD LANCE HASTINGS PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF THE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION OF FOURTH CATHARINE REES BOYD PRESIDENT AND CEO OF THE WESTERN STATES PETROLEUM ASSOCIATION- AND LAST BUT CERTAINLY NOT LEAST K. CAITLYN ROAD NEAR SADR SENIOR MANAGER- U. S. CLIMATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE FUND. LIKE START OFF AND- WELCOME- PAULINA TORRES. GOOD AFTERNOON MURATSUCHI AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I THANK YOU FOR AN OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE AN ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE PERSPECTIVE ON THESE BURYING BRING CRIME ISSUES HI MY NAME IS TELLING A TORRANCE AND THE MEMBER AND THE EIGHTY THIRTY TWO ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ADVISORY COMMITTEE AND AN ATTORNEY WITH THE CENTER ON RACE POVERTY NEED VITAMINS. SYRUPY IS AN ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE NONPROFIT THAT PROVIDES LEGAL AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT TO COMMUNICATE COMMUNITY GROUPS. THROUGHOUT THE SOUTHERN SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY ON AN ARRAY OF POLLUTION ISSUES THEY DISPROPORTIONATELY ACE. MANY IF NOT ALL OF WHICH ARE RELEVANT TO TODAY'S DISCUSSION. THERAPY ALSO WORKS IN CORRELATION WITH VARIOUS STATE BY GROUPS INCLUDING PRICES IN SOLITARY SOLIDARITY AGAINST WHEN THE NEIGHBORHOODS WITH KNOWLEDGE ON THE COMPANY BY MR JUSTICE ALLIANCE CENTRAL VALLEY AIR QUALITY COALITION AMONG MANY OTHERS. THE TOPICS DISCUSSED TODAY ARE ISSUES THAT YOU GROUPS STATEWIDE HAVE CONCERNS QUESTIONS AND MOST IMPORTANTLY EXPERTISE INCLUDING LIVED EXPERIENCES AREN'T. SO I STRONGLY ENCOURAGE THE COMMITTEE TO HOLD A SEPARATE EASY FOCUS HEARING. THE COMMUNITIES I REPRESENT AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY SHARE MANY CONCERNS ABOUT TOPICS DISCUSSED DURING THE COMMITTEE THUS FAR. BUT I'LL FOCUS MY COMMENTS ON REMIND MAIN POINTS IN THE INTEREST OF TRYING. ON THE FIRST SEASON SHARING MEANINGFUL ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE INTEGRATION AND PROCESS. AND ADDRESSING CLIMATE ISSUES. WE HAVE THIS TIME ARM THAT'S SIMPLY JACK. HAVE QUITE AS ARE MY- IT AN BY JOHN FROM IDEATION TO IMPLEMENTATION. AND THIS MEANS THAT COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AND WORKING WITH DJ COMMUNITIES WITH COMMUNITIES MOST IMPACTED. ISN'T JUST A PHASE IN AND AGENCIES- ARE CARDS OVER. IT HIGHLIGHTS THAT ENGAGEMENT IS A CONTINUOUS TASK IN EVERY PHASE OF THE PROJECT. AND WHILE WE RECOGNIZE THE URGENCY OF ADDRESSING THE CLIMATE CRISIS. I'M CARD NEEDS TO LISTEN TO THE JACK WHEN WE SAY WE NEED THE TIME I WE NEED THE RESOURCES TO DO THIS RIGHT HI TO ENSURE THAT OUR COMMUNITIES DON'T GET LEFT BEHIND AS THE STATE DEVELOPS ITS CLINIC POLICIES. I'LL JUST GIVE ONE EXAMPLE AT THE LAST YOU JACK MEETING I'M MEMBERS OF THE EXACT EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT THE PROCESS MOVING TOO QUICKLY. I THAT WE NEED MORE TIME TO UNDERSTAND THE MATERIAL SHARED BY CARP BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY THAT WE NEED AT THE TIME AND RESOURCES TO SHARE THESE COMPLICATED MATERIALS ARE THERE PARTICULARLY ON- MODELING SCENARIO. I'M WITH OUR COMMUNITY. AND IN RESPONSE A REPRESENTATIVE FROM CARVE ICE HE STATED I'M AND INCLUDING IF WE DON'T HEAR FROM YOU ALL WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM IS THE INDUSTRY SIDE BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL READY TO GO. AND AS YOU CAN IMAGINE THIS WAS DEEPLY CONCERNING AND MAINLY BECAUSE THE ONLY ADVISORY GROUP REQUIRED BY LAW FOR CARDS A CONSOLE. FEEDBACK IS ASKING FOR MORE TRYING TO MANY MEANINGFULLY ENGAGE WITH COMMUNITIES AND CARVE. IT'S TELLING US THAT WE RISK GETTING LEFT BEHIND. AND SO I'M KERN IT COMMITTEE TO ENSURE THAT IT WILL IT'S A LIVE. PROGRESS AT THE FROM CAR WHICH THAT THAT PROGRESS IS AN EXTRA LINKED TO THE EFFORTS. WE AND SOLUTION MADE BY AND ON SIDE E. G. COMMUNITY. AND I FURTHER URGES COMMITTEE TO ASK CARBON EACH TO CALL OUTLINED AN EASY PROCESS FOR THE SCOPING PLAN. THAT ENSURES EASY INTEGRATION THROUGHOUT. I THE SECOND CONCERN I'D LIKE TO ADDRESS IS CARDS RELIANCE ON ALL SOLUTIONS TO CLIMATE CHANGE THEY'RE BEING PUSHED FORWARD WITHOUT REGARD TO THEIR POTENTIALLY AND FOR SOME. UNKNOWN CONTINUE DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACTS EACH YEAR COMMUNITIES. IN THAT AND I JUST OF TIME OFF OKAY CENTER HIGHLIGHTS CONCERNS REGARDING THESE ALSO LUCIEN'S. AT THE EXPENSE OF PRIORITIZING DIRECT EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS. AND FOR EXAMPLE WE SHARE MANY CONCERNS- DISCUSSED SO FAR SOME ITERATED BY GERMANY CG ABOUT THAT. BERMAN CAPTAINCY SEQUESTRATION TECHNOLOGIES THAT PERPETUATE THE USE OF FOSSIL FUELS AS PART OF THE CLIMATE SOLUTIONS ARE. GENEROUSLY I. B. STEP KNOWLEDGE'S FUNDAMENTALLY PROLONG THE LIFE OF EXISTING FOSSIL FUEL INFRASTRUCTURE. WHICH MEANS ALSO PROLONGS ITS HARMFUL IMPACTS ON COMMUNITIES. IT'S EVIDENT THAT CARBON IS RELYING ON CCS TECHNOLOGIES TO SOME DEGREE BUT THESE TECHNOLOGIES AFFECTIVELY ALLOW POLLUTERS TO POLLUTER ABSENT AS WELL WITH CARDS FRAMEWORK- OF SOURCES EQUAL SEATS. INSIDE ONE OF REEMPHASIZE THAT INCORPORATING CCS TECHNOLOGIES WAS PROPOSE AND DEVELOP WITHOUT THE INPUT. OF THE E. JACK OR EAT EAT A COMMUNITIES. AND ALSO UNDERLYING OUR CONCERN REGARDING FUNDS CLIMATE SOLUTIONS IS THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM INSIDE LIKE THEY JUST. THANK BY SHARE BACKER FOR THE LETTER SUBMITTED ALONGSIDE SENATORS HERTZBERG IN MY CASKET SECURE RANDOLPH. THIS LETTER CAPTURED OUR CONCERNS ABOUT AB ONE NINETY SEVEN UNEQUIVOCAL MANDATE THAT CAR PRIORITIZE DIRECT EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS IN THAT THERE IS NO AMBIGUITY ABOUT AB ONE NINETY SEVENS IN CHINA. THAT IT WAS DESIGNED. TO FOCUS ATTENTION ON POLICIES OTHER THAN HAPPENED. IT'S WHITE THE COMMITTEE TO OVERSEE CUTS TO BUY BUY THEIR OF WHEN I SEVEN. BY ENSURING THAT PRIOR. OF DRUG WITH. AND FRANKLY ABOUT HAPPENED HE DOES NOT. EMISSIONS REDUCTION MEASURE. AND WE HOPE THAT THIS FOR. UNDER LEGISLATIVE OVER WITH CARD TO. THE FAILURE FAILURES ON THE CAPTAIN PROGRAM AND I KNOW I'M RUNNING OUT OF TIME SO FIND THE WANT TO MAKE- I LAUGHED WHEN- THAT CLARK MUST PRAYER. A G. B. ACHIEVING THAT THIRTY TWO TWO THIRTY TWO. AND I UNDER THAT PART HAS INTERPRETED ITS REQUIREMENT. TIED TO THE TWENTY THIRTY STATUTORY TARGETS TO ENCOMPASS OTHER REQUIREMENTS SUCH AS LIKE CARBON AND NEUTRALITY EXECUTIVE ORDERS. WHAT I WANT TO EMPHASIZE ON THE NEED TO REFOCUS CRACKED THE TENSION TO ARE REQUIRED IN MORE IMMINENT SB THIRTY TWO GOAL OF REDUCING GHG EMISSIONS. 40% BELOW AT THE NINETEEN NINETY LEVELS BY TWENTY THIRTY- I WOULD APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE'S TIME AND GET AGAIN ENCOURAGES SEPARATE COMMITTEE HEARING EXCLUSIVELY FOCUSED ON ENVIRONMENTAL. JUSTICE ISSUES THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I WANT TO. THAT TO YOU ABSOLUTELY RIGHT I MEAN SO MANY OF THESE ISSUES THIS SURVEY. A HEARING AID AND- AND OF A SELF TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE THAT YOU'RE RAISING AND SO. I DO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT. NEXT WE HAVE A ANDREW MEREDITH- REPRESENTING THE STATE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL. GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN THANK YOU FOR GIVING US THE OPPORTUNITY TO WEIGH IN TODAY. WE HAD. THIS CONVERSATION TO SOME DEGREE LAST WEEK WITH THE SECRETARY OF LABOR OUR BROTHER MARTY WALSH. WE'RE HAPPY TO SHARE SOME OF THESE TALKING POINTS TODAY AS WELL. THE PHONE CONFIRMING YES IT HAS BEEN TESTED. SO AGAIN ON THE INTERNET WITH THE STATE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL. AS MOST OF YOU KNOW WE REPRESENT ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND CONSTRUCTION WORKERS ACROSS THE STATE. INCLUDING OVER SEVENTY THOUSAND REGISTERED STATE APPRENTICES. WE HAVE BUILT THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE COMMERCIAL SCALE RENEWABLE ENERGY PROJECTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. INCLUDING OVER TWENTY SIX THOUSAND MEGAWATTS OF SOLAR ALONE. I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT FIRST ABOUT THE THINGS THAT WE BELIEVE THAT WORKS FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM WE THINK HAS HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL IT'S HELPS PROTECT MANUFACTURING JOBS IN CALIFORNIA. AND IT'S PROTECTED OUR ABILITY TO BE A MANUFACTURING POWERHOUSE IN THIS COUNTRY. WE ALSO BELIEVE PUBLIC INVESTMENTS IN RENEWABLE ENERGY HAVE HAVE BEEN MEANINGFUL. AND THEY HAVE DRIVEN THE MARKET TO THE POINT WHERE THE ENERGY IS CHEAP AND IT'S AFFORDABLE TO DEPLOY WE ALSO BELIEVE THE INITIAL PHASING OF THE EEVEE CHARGING APPARATUS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN MAJOR METROPOLITAN PARTS OF THE STATE. RURAL PARTS OF THE STATE THOUGH HAVE BEEN LEFT BEHIND IT WILL NEED TO BE EXPANDED AS WE FURTHER DEPLOY EVEY VEHICLES. SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE WANT THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER MOVING FORWARD. WE BELIEVE THAT SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC INVESTMENT IS GOING TO BE REQUIRED IN THE FIRST CARBON REDUCTION AND RENEWABLE PORTFOLIOS. CARBON CAPTURE GREEN HYDROGEN PUMP STORAGE OFFSHORE WIND. BIOMASS SOLAR ALL OF THESE TECHNOLOGIES ARE VIABLE THEY ALL DESERVE ATTENTION THEY SHOULD BE MODELED AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH THE SCOPING PLAN. AND THEY THEY'RE DEFINITELY SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH THAT PUBLIC INVESTMENT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED. WE ALSO BELIEVE STRICT LABOR STANDARDS SHOULD BE A PART OF ANY PUBLIC INVESTMENTS IN THESE TECHNOLOGIES. INCLUDING THE INTERNALIZATION OF PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENTS COMMUNITY WORKFORCE TRAINING AGREEMENTS. AND SKILLED AND TRAINED LANGUAGE BEING INSERTED ACTUALLY INTO FUTURE LEGISLATION. LASTLY WE BELIEVE INCLUDING WORKERS IN THESE CONVERSATIONS SHOULD BE PARAMOUNT AT ALL TIMES WE HAVE BEEN ENGAGED IN THE SCOPING PLAN PROCESS WITH CARD WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITY. BUT FRANKLY WE FEEL OUR VOICE HAS BEEN MARGINALIZED IN THESE DISCUSSIONS. TO THE POINT THAT WE'VE LITERALLY HAD TO DEMAND THAT CARVE INCLUDE A LEVER VOICE ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMITTEE WE DON'T THINK THINGS SHOULD GET TO THIS POINT. WE BELIEVE LABOUR'S VOICE SHOULD BE PARAMOUNT WE BELIEVE IT IT'S IMPORTANT IN THIS DISCUSSION AND WE BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD BE LISTEN TO. THE OVER OVER OVER ARCHING MESSAGE OF OUR ORGANIZATION IS THAT WE HAVE BEEN A GOOD STRONG PARTNER IN DEPLOYING RENEWABLE ENERGY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. YOUR VOICES CONSISTENT CONSISTENTLY BEEN MARGINALIZED IN THESE DISCUSSIONS AS I JUST EXPLAINED. EXTREMIST VIEWS ON ADDRESSING CLIMATE CHANGE SEEM TO RULE THE DAY. BUMPER STICKER TALKING POINTS LIKE SHUT OFF EVERYTHING NOW WILL BE IN FOSSIL FUELS TOMORROW SEEM TO RESONATE WITH TOO MANY MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE TOO MANY FOLKS THAT CARB. THESE TALKING POINTS SIGNAL OR SCIENCE BIG NOR DATA AND IGNORE THE FACTS ON THE GROUND. CALIFORNIA IS FRANKLY NOT READY TO SHUT EVERYTHING OFF IN THE FOSSIL FUEL SECTOR. OUR POWER GRID IS ALREADY STRUGGLING. IN FACT THE STRUGGLING TO THE POINT THAT STARTING TOMORROW HUNDREDS OF OUR WORKERS AROUND THE STATE. ARE WORKING UNDER A EMERGENCY AGREEMENTS. TO DEPLOY GAS TURBINE GENERATION- TECHNOLOGY IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE STATE TO DEAL WITH WHAT IS EXPECTED TO BE UNPRECEDENTED POWER SHORTAGES IN THE NEXT THIRTY DAYS. THERE IS A PUSH TO IGNORE STRATEGIES LIKE CARBON CAPTURE BECAUSE SOME WOULD RATHER SEE WHOLE INDUSTRIES CRUMBLE. BEEN SEE IF CARBON REDUCTION MEASURES CAN KEEP THEM VIABLE FOR A PERIOD OF TIME. WE ARE CONSTANTLY FIGHTING ON THE FRONT LINES TO DEPLOY RENEWABLE PROJECTS LIKE WIND ENERGY ONES WENT VIRAL MENTAL GROUPS FREQUENTLY RISE TO OPPOSE THEM. WHEN OFFSHORE WIND BEGINS TO MATERIALIZE IN THE STATE WE WILL BE BATTLING THE SAME GROUPS IN THE SAME BOTTLES. JUST IN DIFFERENT AREAS OF CALIFORNIA. INDUSTRY IS RESPONDING FOR THE CLIMATE CRISIS PROJECTS LIKE RODEO RENEWED IN CONTRA COSTA COUNTY WHERE PHILLIPS SIXTY SIX WILL INVEST IN TRANSITIONING THEIR EXISTING PLANT. TO BE ABLE TO PRODUCE OVER EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION GALLONS OF RENEWABLE DIESEL OR AN EXAMPLE OF THAT. WELL THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNITY EMBRACE IT. CALIFORNIA COMPANIES ARE RESPONDING AS WELL IN OTHER SECTORS. BLUE PLANET FOR EXAMPLE BASED OUT OF LOS GATOS. IS UTILIZING CO TWO TO REPLACE TRADITIONAL BUILDING MATERIALS INCLUDING IN CONCRETE. THERE CONCRETE WAS ACTUALLY DEPLOYED IN AN EXPANSION PROJECT AT THE SAN FRANCISCO INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT. NONE OF THESE EFFORTS WILL CONTINUE AND THERE WON'T BE ANY OTHER EFFORTS LIKE THEM IF MESSAGING FROM THE LEGISLATURE OR MESSAGING FROM CARP CALLS THESE TECHNOLOGIES INTO QUESTION. WE NEED STRONG MESSAGING IN STRONG SUPPORT FROM ELECTED OFFICIALS AND GOVERNMENT AGENCIES THAT THESE TYPES OF TECHNOLOGIES ARE IMPORTANT. AND SHOULD BE PART OF OUR PLAN TO ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE IN CALIFORNIA. HE BY DID ADMINISTRATION IS LEADING THIS DIALOGUE NOW THEY'RE CALLING FOR SUPPORT OF CARBON CAPTURE THEIR INVESTING TIME EFFORT AND MONEY INTO OFFSHORE WIND. WE NEED TO REGAIN OUR PLACE AT THE HEAD OF THAT DISCUSSION. AS THIS RELATES TO OUR MEMBERS WANT TO POINT OUT THAT IN SOME POINT IN EVERY CALENDAR YEAR. OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND OF OUR MEMBERS ARE WALKING THROUGH GATES TO PERFORM WORK IN THE FOSSIL FUEL INDUSTRY. THESE JOBS ARE LIKE A LOT OF THE LIKE ALL OF THE OTHER JOBS IN THE BUILDING TRADES THAT BARRIER FREE. THERE'S NO CONSIDERATION GIVEN TO AN INDIVIDUAL'S RACE ECONOMIC BACKGROUNDS. YOUR INCARCERATION IN FOSTER CARE STATUS THEIR BARRIER FREE THESE MEMBERS ARE HIGHLY SKILLED THE HIGHLY PRODUCTIVE AND THEY'RE FULLY CAPABLE OF TRANSITIONING THEIR SKILLS INTO OTHER MEANINGFUL TECHNOLOGIES. AS THE INDUSTRY TRANSITIONS THESE WORKERS HAVE NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT IF WE EMBRACE TECHNOLOGY LIKE CARBON CAPTURE IF WE EMBRACE CARBON SEQUESTRATION. AND IF WE IGNORE THE BUMPER STICKER TALKING POINTS THAT WE'RE CONSTANTLY BOMBARDED WITH. THE WAY WE PHASE OUT FOSSIL FUELS IN THE STATE WILL BE PARAMOUNT IN DETERMINING WHETHER OR NOT WE WILL HAVE A BLUE COLLAR WORKING MIDDLE CLASS IN THE STATE IN THE FUTURE. TO THAT END IF THE LAST DROP OF OIL. IN CALIFORNIA ISN'T EXTRACTED AND REFINED IN THE STATE WE FAILED NOT ONLY THE ENVIRONMENTS. AS OUR LABOR STANDARDS ARE STRICTER HERE THAN THEY ARE IN ANY OTHER PART OF THE COUNTRY AND OUR ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS ARE JUST DISTRICTS. BUT WE ALSO FEEL THESE WORKERS. THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ARE MASSIVE IN CALIFORNIA AND WE RECOGNIZE THAT. OUR RESERVOIRS ARE RUNNING DRY OR FORESTS ARE CONSTANTLY BURNING AND THINGS ARE GETTING BETTER. BY THE TIME I GET HOME TONIGHT FROM MY HOME AND TO HIM A COUNTY BY POWER WILL BE SHUT OFF AS PART OF THE PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF PROGRAM. WE CANNOT. HOWEVER MOVE FORWARD WITH THE STRATEGY THAT BELIEVES WE CAN SHUT OFF ALSO FUELS TOMORROW. DROPPING EVEY VEHICLE AND EVERYONE'S DRIVEWAY TOMORROW NIGHT. AND THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO. GOOD FAITH OUR WAY THROUGH THE CLIMATE CHANGE CRISIS WE MUST EMBRACE ALL TECHNOLOGIES WE MUST DEPLOY THESE TECHNOLOGIES WE MUST INVEST IN THEM WE MUST EMBRACE THINGS LIKE THE SOLEMNIZATION AN OFF STREAM STORAGE TO DIVERSIFY OUR WATER PORTFOLIO. WE MUST HARD AND DIVERSIFY OUR ELECTRICAL GRID. BOOKS OF THE SUBSIDIZATION WILL BE PARAMOUNT TO MAKING THIS HAPPEN. LASTLY WE GET ASKED THIS QUITE A BIT ABOUT THE TERM JUST TRANSITION I DON'T WANT TO BE CLEAR ABOUT WHAT OUR ORGANIZATION BELIEVES ABOUT THE TERM UST TRANSITION. OR MEMBERS JUST WANT TO HAVE A MIDDLE CLASS JOBS OUR MEMBERS JUST WANT TO HAVE A DIGNIFIED RETIREMENTS OR MEMBERS JUST WANT TO KEEP THEIR MEDICAL DENTAL VISION BENEFITS MOVING INTO THE FUTURE. OUR MEMBERS JUST WANT TO HAVE A VOICE IN MAKING SURE THAT THAT CONTINUES TO HAPPEN INTO THE FUTURE. AND OUR MEMBERS JUST ARE LOOKING TO YOU FOR SOLUTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR MEREDITH AND I. I HAD FORGOTTEN THAT YOU WERE AND I BELIEVE THE ONLY SPEAKER THAT'S HERE IN PERSON SO I APPRECIATE YOUR PATIENCE AND FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. NEXT WE HAVE A LANCE HASTINGS A PRESIDENCY OF THE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I WILL TAKE HIS PRESIDENT OF CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION WE REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR INVITATION. YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON THE STATE'S CLIMATE POLICIES AND THE HEARING TODAY. I THINK MANY OF YOU KNOW THE TNC REPRESENTS MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED MANUFACTURERS. THEY WERE INDUSTRY THAT EMPLOYS MORE THAN ONE POINT TWO MILLION AMERICAN WORKERS HERE IN CALIFORNIA. OUR AVERAGE WAGES EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR WHICH IS FANTASTIC AND REALLY SUPPORTS THE MIDDLE CLASS. AND IT DOES PROVIDE AN EXCITED UPWARDLY MOBILE CAREER TO A DIVERSE MIDDLE CLASS WORKFORCE. MANY FACTORS SECTOR ALSO CREATES FOR THE LARGEST POSITIVE IMPACTS ON OUR ECONOMY. WITH EACH OF OUR JOBS ACCORDING AT LEAST TO HELP OTHERS IN THE STATE. AS WELL AS THE MASSIVE SUPPLY CHAINS. BUT FOR MANY REASONS THEREFORE MANUFACTURING DISCIPLINE THE BACKBONE CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY. ALL OF THAT CALIFORNIA'S GHG POLICY DISCUSSIONS AND REGULATIONS REALLY MUST ANSWER TO THRESHOLD QUESTIONS FOR THE FIRST. IS A COST EFFECTIVE AND IT'S SECONDARILY IT WAS DEPARTMENT BASED ON THE OTHER COMMENTS TODAY IS A TECHNOLOGICALLY FEASIBLE. PRESERVATION AND BEST ANIMATION OPTIONALITY. TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL POLICY WILL ALLOW CAPITAL ENVIRONMENTAL MARKETS IDENTIFY THE MOST EFFECTIVE SOLUTIONS. MANY OF OUR MEMBERS ARE OBLIGATED PARTIES ARE COVERED ENTITIES AND HAVE RESPONSIBILITY TO REDUCE THEIR EMISSIONS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE STATE'S CLIMATE POLICY REQUIREMENTS. MOST IF NOT ALL HAVE SPENT A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF RESOURCES AND GHG REDUCTIONS ALREADY FOR THE FIRST TWO ROUNDS OF CALIFORNIA'S CLIMATE REQUIREMENTS IT IS VERY EFFICIENCIES OR THE CAP AND TRADE SYSTEM. MANY FACTORS ARE ENERGY INTENSIVE TRADE EXPOSED BUSINESSES. THIS IS THE PASSAGE OF AB THIRTY TWO IN TWO THOUSAND SIX. THE LEGISLATURE TO RECOGNIZE THAT OUR STATE'S CLIMATE POLICIES SHOULD NOT RESULT IN EMISSIONS LEAKAGE AND SIFTING. MANY FACTORS OUTSIDE OF OUR BORDERS AS WAS MENTIONED EARLIER TODAY AS WELL. ACT WE NEED TO KEEP THAT MANUFACTURING SECTOR HERE SO THAT WE CAN HAVE THE JOBS TO SUPPORT STATE LOCAL FINANCES. TELL MEDICAID AGAINST THE POSSIBILITY BACKING- CARPET WOMEN OF THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM CERTAIN DESIGN ELEMENTS TO PROTECT AGAINST THAT LEAKAGE AND AS RECENTLY AS LAST YEAR SEE HIM TO DATE. STOOD RESOLUTELY TO PROTECT- THAT THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM AS IT EXISTS. OUR COMMITMENT CLIMATE POLICIES TO BE SUCCESSFUL FOR CALIFORNIA TO BE A MODEL FOR THE REST OF THE WORLD. OUR MEMBERS NEED TO HAVE TOOLS TO COMPLY. WITH THE PROGRAM AND HELP CONTAIN COSTS. I THINK YOU'LL BE HERE IN A MOMENT ABOUT. MORE OF THE CCS PROGRAM FROM MY OTHER- PANELS AND COLLEAGUES SO I'M GONNA FOCUS MY EFFORTS HERE ON COST CONTAINMENT. IT'S NO QUESTION THAT THE DEPARTMENT. POPCORN SB THIRTY TWO ESPECIALLY IN YOUR PENDING AB THIRTEEN NINETY FIVE MISTER CHAIRMAN. WILL BE EXPENSIVE TO CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA. THERE'S NO SCENARIO THAT I'M AWARE OF. WHERE WE CAN ACHIEVE THIS DRAMATIC EMISSION REDUCTIONS WITHOUT THE COST OF CONVENTIONAL ENERGY SOURCES INCREASING. VERY SIGNIFICANTLY IN FACT THERE ARE TWO STUDIES COMMISSIONED BY THE LEGISLATURE ANDRE BE SEVENTY FOUR IN SB ONE HUNDRED THE STATE CLEARLY THAT ACHIEVING THESE CARBON TROPICALES IN THE ELECTRICITY AND TRANSPORTATION SECTORS WILL BE EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE FOR YOUR CONSTITUENTS. IT FOR BUSINESSES HERE IN CALIFORNIA. FOR THAT REASON COST CONTAINMENT POLICY DESIGNED THAT A MANAGED DECLINE IS CRITICAL FOR CMG MEMBERS AND CONSUMERS. THE LEGISLATURE DID RECOGNIZE THE NEED FOR COST CONTAINMENT WHEN THEY PASSED AB THREE NINETY EIGHT AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN. AS MANY OF YOU RECALL AT THE LEGISLATURE PASSED MR GARCIA'S AB THREE NINETY EIGHT. I TO SUPPORT IN A TWO THIRDS. THAT LEVEL OF STAKEHOLDER BOTHER COOPERATION CAME TOGETHER THEN CHECKS DOWN THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM OUT TO TWENTY THIRTY WAS INCREDIBLY SIGNIFICANT SHOULD BE THE GOAL FOR YOU TODAY. STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING CMC MEMBERS LABOR AND ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS ALSO PORTED AB THREE NINETY EIGHT. WE AGREED THAT WELL DESIGNED CLIMATE CLIMATE POLICY ALSO HAD TO PROTECT JOBS. CORRECT COMPANIES WITHIN THE STATE. AB THREE NINETY EIGHT CLEARLY DIRECTED YOUR RESOURCES BOARD TO CONTAIN COSTS WE KNOW THAT THESE PROGRAMS ARE NOT ZERO COST WE MUST DESIGN AND TO BALANCE THE NEED FOR PROGRESS TOWARD. OUR CLIMATE GOALS AND PROTECTING YOUR CONSTITUENTS FROM ALREADY RISING COSTS. FOR THE REGULATORS THE LEGISLATURE LOOK TOWARD IMPLEMENTING THE TWENTY THIRTY GOALS INVESTIGATING PATHWAYS TO CARBON NEUTRALITY. WE MUST BE MINDFUL TO TAKE AN ECONOMY WIDE APPROACH AND AVOID OVERBURDENING SPECIFIC SECTORS. YEAH PEOPLE I CLIMATE CHANGE WITHOUT ALSO PROTECTING OUR JOBS AND THE ECONOMY. AS THE BACKBONE OF OUR STATE'S ECONOMY MANUFACTURED AS IMPORT ROLEPLAY DEVELOPING AND IMPLEMENTING EACH EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS TECHNOLOGIES THEY WANT TO WORK WITH YOU AND THEIR RESOURCES BOARD DIPLOMAT CRITICAL POLICY DESIGNS THAT WILL ACHIEVE OUR STATE'S EMISSION REDUCTION GOALS FOR THE SAME TIME. PROTECT OUR MANUFACTURING JOBS AND OUR ECONOMY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY AND REPORTS ANY QUESTIONS THE MAKE UP AFTER THE PANEL CONCLUDED THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU MISTER HASTINGS I THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE ALSO. I AND NEXT WE HAVE A KATHY READ HIS BOYD- PRESIDENT AND CEO OF THE WESTERN STATES PETROLEUM ASSOCIATION. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN MURATSUCHI CAN YOU HEAR ME OK YES WE CAN. OKAY WONDERFUL- GOOD AFTERNOON AND TO YOU AND TO MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M CATHERINE HIGHS BUOYED AND I'M PRESIDENT AND CEO OF THE WESTERN STATES PETROLEUM ASSOCIATION I WANT TO THANK YOU. FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY IN FRONT OF THE COMMITTEE TODAY. ARE THE TOPICS THAT ARE PRESENTED TO YOU TODAY ARE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THEIR PORTENT FOR DETERMINING THE PATHWAY FORWARD TO MEETING OUR STATE'S COMICAL AND A GOAL THAT WE ALL SHARE. BUT I THINK EVEN EVIDENCE TODAY AS ALWAYS THE DETAILS OF HOW WE GET THERE ACTUALLY DO MATTER. AND WE CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THAT AT ALL OF THE ABOVE APPROACH FIRST ANIMAL ENERGY FUTURE IS OF UTMOST IMPORTANCE. JUST FOUR YEARS AGO THIS BODY PASSED SIGNIFICANT CLIMATE LEGISLATION THAT DIRECTED THE STATE TO MEET OUR TWENTY THIRTY GOALS IN A MANNER THAT MINIMIZE COSTS TO YOUR CONSTITUENTS. AND PROTECTS CALIFORNIA JOBS AND BUSINESSES. YOUR EXTENDED THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM OUT TO TWENTY THIRTY WHICH WE SUPPORTED. AND YOU DIRECTED CARP TO PRIORITIZE COST CONTAINMENT IN THEIR IMPLEMENTATION. OF THE STATE'S CLIMATE POLICIES. WE ARE ONLY EIGHT MONTHS INTO CARDS IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SB THIRTY TO TARGET. AS OUTLINED IN THE BACKGROUND PAPER WHICH BY THE WAY I THOUGHT WAS VERY WELL DONE. YOUR RESOURCES BOARD IS CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE PATHWAYS TO MEET OUR TWENTY THIRTY GOALS AS WELL AS CARBON NEUTRALITY BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE COOL. THIS EVALUATION INCLUDES A VERY ROBUST AND LINK THE STAKEHOLDER PROCESS. AND WILL ULTIMATELY YIELD A SET OF POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE AIR B. THIS WORK IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. ESPECIALLY AS THE LEGISLATURE IS CONSIDERING NEW. AND DRAMATICALLY MORE AGGRESSIVE TARGETS IN AB AB THIRTEEN NINETY FIVE. A PROPOSAL FOR NEW CAR TARGETS FAR INTO THE FUTURE BEYOND TWENTY THIRTY. IS INCOMPLETE WITHOUT CERTAINTY ON THE POLICIES ARE TOOLS THAT WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR COMPLIANCE AND WE KNOW WHAT TOOLS WE HAVE THROUGH TWENTY THIRTY BECAUSE OF THE DIRECTION THIS LEGISLATURE PROVIDED IN AB THREE NINETY EIGHT IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN. SO IT IS CRITICAL THAT WE KNOW WHICH TOOLS AND PATHWAYS WILL BE AVAILABLE TO TREAT THE NEW GOALS THAT REACH BEYOND TWENTY THIRTY. WITHOUT THIS INFORMATION WE YOU CAN'T BEGIN TO HAVE AN INFORMED DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT FUTURE TARGETS WILL MEAN. TO YOUR CONSTITUENTS INTO THE STATE'S ECONOMY. THE PATH BOTH THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM AND THE LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD PROGRAM HAVE DRIVEN TREMENDOUS INNOVATION AND CERTAINLY IN OUR INDUSTRY AND OTHERS. AND WE MUST CONSIDER HOW THESE POLICIES CONTINUE TO EFFECTUATE THE PORTENT GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS AND INNOVATIONS GOING FORWARD FORWARD. AND I BELIEVE RATHER THAN SETTING A NEW GOAL TWENTY FOUR YEARS OUT. AS PROPOSED IN AB THIRTEEN NINETY FIVE THAT THIS LEGISLATURE CAN MAKE MUCH MORE SIGNIFICANT CLIMATE PROGRESS THIS YEAR. BY DEMONSTRATING THE POLITICAL WILL NECESSARY TO DEPLOY CARBON CAPTURE AND SEQUESTRATION IN CALIFORNIA AND ENSURING THAT THE STATE IS ON TRACK TO MEET OUR CLIMATE GOALS. AND I HAVE BEEN IN THAT CONVERSATION FOR QUITE SOME TIME WHEN I WAS APPOINTED. BY THE LEGISLATURE IN THE ENERGY COMMISSION TO SIT ON A PANEL WHEN WE MAPPED OUT C. C. U. S. QUITE SOMETIME AGO FOR HOW TO REACH THAT IN CALIFORNIA. AN EXPERT INCLUDING THE IPCC AND FRANKLY. THE ENTIRE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AGREED THAT CCS TECHNOLOGY WILL BE KEY IN ADVANCING OUR CLIMATE GOALS. AND SENATOR SKINNER APPRECIATE YOU KNOW THE OPPORTUNITIES HERE AND I KNOW THAT THEY ARE BROUGHT OPPORTUNITIES AND WE- ARE INTERESTED IN ALL OF THEM- IT CERTAINLY EVEN ONCE ON THE NATURAL WORKING LANDS. SO WHY OTHER STATES AND COUNTRIES ARE PERMITTING AND BUILDING THESE PROJECTS AND THERE ARE MANY WHICH I COULD ARTICULATED BUT THAT PART TIME. CALIFORNIA IS IN MY OPINION FALLING WOEFULLY BEHIND DESPITE HAVING SOME OF FRANKLY THE BEST SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKFORCE. THE WORLD'S LEADING UNIVERSITIES AND LABORATORIES A HIGHLY MOTIVATED INDUSTRIAL SECTOR AND SOME OF FRANKLY THE BEST GEOLOGY IN THE WORLD TO STORE CARBON. SO NOW IS OUR OPPORTUNITY TO FRANKLY MAKE UP FOR LOST TIME ENSURE THAT WE CAN LEAD OUR TECHNOLOGIES AND SOLUTIONS AND OUR INDUSTRY. LET ME REPEAT OUR INDUSTRY IS HERE TO HELP YOU THAT AND WE HAVE MANY PROJECTS TO TALK ABOUT BEING CONSIDERED IN THIS ROUND. SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THIS COMMITTEE THE LEGISLATURE CARBON OTHER STATE AGENCIES. TO REALLY ENSURE WERE SUCCESSFUL IN MEETING OUR CURRENT CLIMATE GOALS AND LEADING THE WORLD. IN WHAT WE BELIEVE ARE TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU- AS REYES BOYD- I WHITFORD AND CONTINUE THIS CONVERSATION OUR QUESTION AND ANSWER AND LAST IN TERMS OF OUR OUR PANEL SPEAKERS BUT CERTAINLY NOT LEAST WE HAVE CAITLYN RODNER SUTTER WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE FUND. THANK YOU SO MUCH TERROR AT CG CAN YOU HEAR ME OK YES WE CAN THANK YOU. EXCELLENT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY I'M CAITLIN REDNER CENTER WITH ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE FUND- AND I'D LIKE TO START BY ADDRESSING THE TWENTY THIRTY GOAL THAT WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING- EDS PERSPECTIVE ON ON SOME NEEDED POLICY ADJUSTMENTS TO MEET THAT GOAL. THEN DISCUSS THE IMPROPER IMPORTANCE OF EIGHT NO LATER THAN TWENTY FORTY FIVE NET ZERO GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION GOAL. AND I'M ALSO GOING TO BRIEFLY TOUCH ON SOME AIR QUALITY CONSIDERATIONS AND IN MEETING BOTH OF THOSE GOALS. SO SB THIRTY TO CONTINUE CALIFORNIA'S CLIMATE LEGACY OF CLIMATE LEADERSHIP AND CODIFIED- TWENTY THIRTY GOAL. IN MEETING THIS GOAL IS ESSENTIAL FOR LIMITING CALIFORNIA'S IMPACT ON THE CLIMATE. THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT CALIFORNIA ALREADY HAS THE SWEET OF POLICIES IT NEEDS TO MEET THIS GOAL INCLUDING THE ECONOMY WIDE DECLINING LIMIT ON GREENHOUSE GASES. WHEN WELL DESIGNED TO THIS LIMIT OR CAP PROVIDES THE GREATEST POSSIBLE CERTAINTY OF MEETING THE WRIT BEATING REDUCTION GOALS AND IT IS V. ESSENTIAL FEATURE OF THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM. IT'S SECTOR SPECIFIC POLICIES ACHIEVE GREATER REDUCTIONS THAN EXPECTED THEN THERE IS LESS PRESSURE ON THE CAP AND THAT'S FINE. BUT IF OTHER PROGRAMS DELIVER FEWER REDUCTIONS IN THE CAP HAS TO REMAIN THE BACKSTOPS TO ENSURE EMISSIONS CONTINUE TO DECLINE AT THE PEACE REQUIRED TO MEET OUR GOALS. HOWEVER IN ORDER TO CONTINUE PLAYING THE ROLE OF BACKSTOPS EMISSIONS CAP HAS TO BE CALIBRATED TO ACTUALLY MEET THE TWENTY THIRTY PEOPLE. IN CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO INCREASE THE AMBITION OF THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM THAT IS TIGHTEN THE CAP. TO ENSURE REQUIRED REDUCTIONS BY TWENTY THIRTY. A TIGHTER CAP MEANS THE EMISSIONS BUDGET IS SMALLER FEWER ALLOWANCES ARE ISSUED AND THE LEVEL OF EMISSIONS IS LOWER. AND WE HAVE THIS OPPORTUNITY BECAUSE THIS STATE CELEBRATED AND JUSTIFIABLY SO A GREAT ACHIEVEMENT WHEN IT MET ITS TWENTY TWENTY GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION GOAL OF RETURNING TO NINETEEN NINETY LEVELS FOUR YEARS AHEAD OF SCHEDULE. AND THAT'S SUCCESS MEANS THAT WE HAVE THE CHANCE TO INCREASE THE STRINGENCY OF THE CAP BY SETTING IT BASED ON ACTUAL EMISSIONS WHICH ARE BELOW THE TWENTY TWENTY TARGET. A LOWER EMISSIONS CAP ESSENTIALLY MAKES THOSE REDUCTIONS PERMANENT. ADDITIONALLY THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE ESTIMATED THAT THERE ARE BETWEEN ONE HUNDRED AND THREE HUNDRED MILLION BANKED ALLOWANCES IN THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM. THAT IS ALLOWANCES THAT HAVE BEEN SAVED FOR FUTURE COMPLIANCE USE. NOT WILL BANKING IS NOT INHERENTLY PROBLEMATIC THE BANK HAS TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR IN SETTING THE ADMISSIONS CAP. SO TAKEN TOGETHER THERE IS A NEED TO RE CALIBRATE THE EMISSIONS CAP TO ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIA IS ON TRACK TO MEET ITS TWENTY THIRTY GOAL. IS NOT THE ONLY THING THE STATE NEEDS TO DO BUT IT ISN'T NECESSARY. THE STATE HAS TO AGGRESSIVELY INCREASE THE AMBITION OF ITS POLICY ESPECIALLY CAP AND TRADE AND IT MUST HAPPEN AS SOON AS POSSIBLE TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS STILL TIME TO GET ON TRACK TO TWENTY THIRTY. AT THE SAME TIME CALIFORNIA SHOULD ALSO SEEK ADDITIONAL MEASURES TO ENSURE THE STATE IS ACHIEVING REDUCTIONS IN LOCAL AIR POLLUTION. ALONGSIDE GLOBAL CLIMATE POLLUTION. WELL CALIFORNIA HAS MADE GREAT PROGRESS IN IMPROVING AIR QUALITY IS CHAIR RANDOLPH EXPLAINED EARLIER TODAY. MUCH OF THE STATE STILL SUFFERS FROM DANGEROUS AIR POLLUTION AND THIS PROBLEM IS ESPECIALLY ACUTE IN COMMUNITIES WITH LOWER WEALTH IN COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. EARLIER THIS YEAR WASHINGTON STATE ADOPTED THEIR CLIMATE COMMITMENTS ACT WHICH INCLUDES AIR QUALITY PROVISIONS THAT CALIFORNIA COULD CONSIDER INCLUDING. PERCENT DISABILITY SPECIFIC LIMITATIONS ON OFFSET MEANS ENFORCEABLE CRITERIA POLLUTANT TARGETS THE COMMUNITIES HISTORICALLY OVERBURDENED BY POLLUTION. AND REGULAR PROGRAM REVIEWS TO ENSURE PROGRESS IN REDUCING BOTH CLIMATE AND CONVENTIONAL POLLUTION. WASHINGTON HAS BUILT ON CALIFORNIA'S EXCEPTIONAL CLIMATE LEADERSHIP AND IS NOW EXPLORING ADDITIONAL WAYS TO ADDRESS CLIMATE AND LOCAL POLLUTION IN THE SAME POLICY FRAMEWORK. NOW NEEDING THE TWENTY THIRTY GOAL ALSO HAS SIGNIFICANT IMPLICATIONS FOR MEETING A NO LATER THAN TWENTY FORTY FIVE NET ZERO GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION GOAL WHICH CARD IS ALREADY PLANNING FOR IN IN THE SCOPING PLAN IN WHICH YOU'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT TODAY. ACHIEVING THE TWENTY THIRTY GOAL PUTS US ON TRACK TO ACHIEVE NET ZERO EMISSIONS. AND IS CARB IS DOING WE HAVE TO START PLANNING FOR NET ZERO TODAY. DECISIONS MADE NOW WITH OUR I AM TWENTY THIRTY HAVE TO BE CONSISTENT WITH THE NEED TO ACHIEVE NET ZERO AS SWIFTLY AS POSSIBLE. WE ALSO HAVE TO ENSURE STRATEGIES TO MEET BOTH GOALS PRESERVE ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRITY. AND GOOD AT AN ABSOLUTE MINIMUM STRATEGIES DO NOT CREATE OR EXACERBATE AIR POLLUTION HOT SPOTS. CALIFORNIA NEEDS A LONG TERM VISION OUT TO TWENTY FORTY FIVE ALONGSIDE AN AMBITIOUS PLAN TO MEET THE TWENTY THIRTY GOAL. AT A TIME WHEN THE STATE IS ON FIRE AROUND US AND THE I. P. C. C. IS ISSUING A CODE RED ALERT FOR HUMANITY CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO ENSURE IT IS MAXIMIZING ITS CLIMATE AMBITION AND THE GREATEST POSSIBLE AMOUNT OF EMISSION REDUCTIONS FROM POLLUTING SOURCES. OUR STATE HAS A LONG BEEN A CLIMATE LEADER STATES AND NOW EVEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ARE FOLLOWING OUR EXAMPLE BUT WE MUST ENSURE WE HAVE POLICY IN PLACE TO ACTUALLY MEET THE COMMITMENTS THAT WE'VE MADE. AND THAT WE CONTINUE TO AGGRESSIVELY LEAD ON CLIMATE AMBITION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME TODAY- AND WITH THAT I WILL I WILL CLOSE. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH- AS A RUNNER- WE REALLY- PRACTICE- SO MANY- GREAT SPEAKERS- THIS DID NOT ALL IN THIS PANEL BUT BUT THROUGHOUT THE AFTERNOON AND SO WE REALLY THANK A- ALL OF YOU. WE HAVE A QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SURVISCOR SURE JUST YET THANKS WE COVERED A LOT THERE AS YOU AS YOU SAID- PROFESSIONAL JUSTICE TO CONCERNS ON JOBS TO A NEW TECHNOLOGIES AROUND A CARBON CAPTURE TO- A TO A YEAR COMING BACK TO CAP AND TRADE UP AGAIN. AS A- AS A AS A MECHANISM IN STRENGTHENING CAPTURE WHICH I THINK IS ONE OF THE THEMES THAT WE'VE WE'VE WE'VE SEEN HERE TODAY. SO I'M JUST TRYING TO TRY TO THINK WITH MY- TIME HERE- AT. FIRST PAULINA TORRES WHAT WAS THAT PHRASE YOU HAD ID FROM THE REMOTE JUSTICE FROM IDEATION TO. LIKE THAT PHRASE SERVICES CENTER WILL BE TRAPPED CAPTURE THAT. AND HE'S ABLE TO RESPOND TO THAT. HI CAN YOU HEAR ME YES YES- OKAY I'M IT'S THE FROM ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE FROM IDEATION TO IMPLEMENTATION. YEAH I THINK THAT'S A GOOD FREE MARKET FOR US TO KEEP IN MIND AND I WILL KEEP THAT IN MIND I APPRECIATE THAT- S. R. MENTION A COUPLE THINGS FROM OUR FRIENDS. WITH THE BUILDING TRADES AGAIN THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF DOUBLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD WHICH IS WE'VE HEARD IS ONE OF THE MAJOR. SOURCES OF REDUCTIONS- TODAY AND FOR THE BUILDING TRADE SUPPORT THERE AND- UP OF MY ATTEMPTS TO EXPAND THAT WITH SB SIXTY SEVEN. WHICH WILL BRING BACK IN SOME FORM- NEXT YEAR'S I APPRECIATE. THAT AND- I GUESS FOR CATHERINE APPRECIATE YOU. THAT TALKING ABOUT YOU KNOW SOLUTIONS AND BEING SOLUTION. FOCUSED AND- I GUESS THAT THE QUESTION IS YOU KNOW. WITH WITH YOUR MARKETING DO YOU DO YOU ARE YOU SUPPORT OF A TARGET OF NET ZERO EMISSIONS BY. BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE IN PHILIP THAT'S ACHIEVABLE. YES THANK YOU SENATOR AND YOU KNOW I'M I'M A COMBINATION OF A PRACTICE MEDICINE AND OPTIMISTIC- I DO BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE IN THE SCOPING PLAN AND I THINK THE FOCUS- THIS HEARING ON THE SCOPING PLAN IS REALLY IMPORTANT. BECAUSE ALL OF THOSE SCENARIOS THAT EVERYONE REFERS TO. THAT WE WILL BE LOOKING AT ARE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AS YOU'RE BALANCING. BE GOALS WITH THE IMPACT ON THE ECONOMY AND I SAY THAT. BECAUSE AS WE ALL KNOW AND I DON'T SAY THIS THAT CALIFORNIA SHOULD NOT BE A LEADER IN THE SPACE OF COURSE WE SHORT. BUT CALIFORNIA'S LESS THAN 1% OF THE GLOBAL EMISSIONS IN THIS WORLD AND SO WE DO HAVE TO DEMONSTRATE LEADERSHIP THROUGH PROGRAMS THAT WORK AND THAT BALANCE THE ECONOMY AND THE ENVIRONMENT AND OUR SOCIAL JUSTICE NEEDS ARE OF OUR MIDDLE JUSTICE NEEDS. THAT'S GOING TO BE IMPERATIVE. BUT THE ECONOMIC SIDE OF THIS IS EQUALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE AS WE LOOK AT THESE SCENARIOS AND WE LOOK AT THE TARGET DATES AND WE LOOK AT THE SCOPING PLAN. THEY'RE GOING TO BE ONES THAT CAN THAT IS THAT HAVE OF MUCH HIGHER COSTS THAN OTHERS AND YOU CAN STILL ACHIEVE THE GOALS. IN THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE WAY SO IT'S A LONG WAY TO SAY THAT I THINK WHAT CARP HAS OUTLINED GIVES US MULTIPLE OPPORTUNITY. TO EXPLORE THE RIGHT COMBINATION OF WHAT'S GOING TO BE EFFECTIVE TO MEET THESE GOALS BECAUSE THEY ARE AGGRESSIVE THEY DO SHOW LEADERSHIP. BUT WE CAN'T BRING SO MUCH ECONOMIC CARD ON THE CONSTITUENTS AND CITIZENS OF THE STATE. THAT WE CAN'T HAVE A PROGRAM THAT WILL SURVIVE AND SO I AM OPTIMISTIC ARC OUR MEMBERS ARE ALL OVER INNOVATION IT'S AN EXCITING TIME- I DIDN'T MENTION ALL OF THE CCS ACTIVITY WE HAVE IN THE STATE THAT'S EITHER ON THE BOOKS ARE BEING DISCUSSED. I THINK IT'S VERY EXCITING OPPORTUNITIES AND MANY OF THOSE ARE ARE NOT IN THE FOSSIL FUEL SECTOR THEY ARE AND THEY ARE IN OTHER SECTORS AS WELL SO. WHERE THERE WERE YOU KNOW INNOVATION IS AN R. D. AS I'VE SAID BEFORE OF MANY MANY YEARS AND BEING OUT THIS FOR FORTY YEARS I CAN SAY THAT- BUT I DO THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A BALANCE OF ALL OF IT. AND I DON'T THINK IT'LL BE A SINGLE ANSWER AND I THINK WE WILL BE ABLE TO FIND THE RIGHT PATH. TO GET US THERE IN THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE WAY- POSSIBLE. YEAH THANK YOU FOR THAT AND I GUESS YOU SEE. THE ISSUE IN THE FUTURE WITH PARK IF WE FAR FEWER- GAS OR DIESEL POWERED. VEHICLES ON THE ROAD I THINK YOU AND SHE'S A STRONG ROLE TO PLAY HE SAID IN HYDROGEN OR- CCS FIVE FUELS IN THE FUTURE. BUT HOW HOW DO YOU THINK THE- INDUSTRY LOOKS LIKE IN THAT IN THAT RESPECT AND- YOU KNOW HOW CAN WE WORK TOGETHER ON SOLUTIONS AND TO. TO MOVE TO THE FUTURE. YEAH THANK YOU CENTER AND I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS I LOOK TO IS A LOT OF THE SCENARIOS THAT SOME OF THE COMPANIES PUT TOGETHER WHETHER IT'S SHALL OR- OR B. P. OR OTHERS. AND THE ONE THAT A PARTICULAR INTEREST TO ME IS THE SHELLS AND ARTICLE THE SKY SCENARIO IS YOU LOOK FORWARD. KNOWING WHAT WE KNOW TODAY WE CAN ACTUALLY LOOK INTO THE FUTURE AND AT LEAST MAP OUT WHAT WE THINK WILL HAPPEN WHEN WILL THESE TECHNOLOGIES REALLY TAKE OFF WHEN WILL THEY INTERSECT WHEN WILL NATURAL GAS DECLINED AND HYDROGEN INCREASED- RENEWABLE DIESEL YOU HEARD RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS AND RUN. AND HYDROGEN OUR BIG BOB POTENTIALS IN IN THE WORLD OF TRANSPORTATION FUELS IN THE WORLD OF ELECTRICITY SO I THINK YOU KNOW IT'S NOT TO SAY IT'S AN EXCITING TIME WE HAVE SO MUCH INNOVATION GOING ON. I THINK OUR INDUSTRY IS JUST ANXIOUS WILLING COMMITTED TO STEP TO THE PLATE AND TO ENGAGE IN ALL OF THAT WITH THE LEGISLATURE WITH KERR- WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE TO FIGURE OUT. HOW DO WE GET WHERE WE WANT TO GO IN A WAY THAT KEEPS THE ECONOMY MOVING. AND ALLOWS PEOPLE AS I ALWAYS SAY IF AND PEOPLE GET TIRED OF HEARING IT. ALLOWS US TO WAKE UP EVERY DAY AND DRIVE TO BE. TURN OUR LIGHTS ON AND HEAT AND COOL OUR HOMES AFFORDABLY AND RELIABLY IT CLEANLY AND I THINK WE'RE CAPABLE OF DOING THAT. BUT WE'VE GOT TO BE PRAGMATIC AND WE GOT A LOOK AT THE FACT THAT WE GOT TO SEE WHERE WE ARE AND WHERE WE NEED TO GO I THINK GOD CHAIRWOMAN- FROM CAR MADE MADE THOSE POINTS VERY CLEAR I THINK WORK WEEK WE'VE GOT A LOT OF WORK TO DO BUT- THE SCOPING PLAN IS AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT ONE. AND WERE EXTREMELY ENGAGED AT. FEDERATE THANK YOU VERY MUCH SIR- SALOON MAYES- THE THANK YOU- MISTER CHAIR- THE QUESTION FOR- KATHY AND I APOLOGIZE IF YOU ADDRESSED THIS- DURING YOUR BRIEFING I WAS ACTUALLY RUNNING BACK UP FROM- FROM ANOTHER MEETING- BUT I KNOW THAT EARLIER- IN THE HEARING TODAY BOTH THE SUMMER BURKE AND I WERE TALKING ABOUT THE QUESTION OF EQUITY- KNOWING THAT FOLKS IN THE INLAND EMPIRE WHERE I REPRESENT RIVERSIDE SAN BENITO COUNTY DRIVE A LOT- THEY DRIVE. ME TO THE ANYWHERE FROM FROM A COUPLE MILES A DAY BUT MOST FOLKS WILL DRIVE- AN HOUR HALF AN HOUR AND A HALF TO TWO AND A HALF HOURS EVERY SINGLE DAY TO BE ABLE TO GET TO GET TO WORK AND JUST WANTED TO FIND OUT IN REGARDS TO OIL- AND GASOLINE- AND TALK ABOUT TRANSPORTATION- AND THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR- WHERE WHERE IS THE INDUSTRY AT- TODAY WHERE WE AT WITH TRANSPORTATION AND WHAT IT WHAT ARE YOU GUYS THINKING. THAT'S GOING TO LOOK LIKE- OVER THE NEXT- YOU COULD COUPLE OF YEARS- AND EVEN EVEN DECADES HERE IN CALIFORNIA. YEAH THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE FOR THE QUESTION A FAMILY MAN AND- YOU CAN REALLY GETTING INTO THE TRANSPORTATIONS THE DEMAND SIDE OF THE SENATE IT'S OUR JOB. FRED IT'S OUR JOB TO PROVIDE THE ENERGY CONSUMERS DEMAND. BECAUSE THEY DO THAT EVERY DAY RIGHT WE'VE GOT. FORTY MILLION PEOPLE THAT DRIVE THIRTY SIX MILLION CARS AND TRUCKS- AND EVEN THOUGH THE GOVERNOR PLANS TO BAN THE SALE OF INTERNAL COMBUSTION TO TWENTY THIRTY FIVE. WE'RE STILL GOING TO HAVE CLOSE TO THAT AMOUNT. FOR SOMETIME TO COME THAT HAVE TO BE FUELED. AND I KNOW THIS LEGISLATURE IS GOING TO DEMAND THAT WE DO THAT. WE ARE GOING TO AND WHAT WORK AND WILL HAVE TO DO IT IS YOU KNOW CLEAN AND BEST AS WE POSSIBLY CAN. TO MAKE SURE THAT THE ECONOMY CONTINUES TO MOVE. IT IS A FACT THAT THIS STATE IS THE THIRD LARGEST CONSUMER OF TRANSPORTATION FUELS IN CALIFORNIA THAT'S ALL OF US. YOU KNOW THAT EVERYBODY IN THE STATE WE ARE THE THIRD LARGEST CONSUMER. AND THE ONLY ONE WHO IS ABOVE US IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND CHINA. SO WE WILL IT'S A IT'S A BIG ISSUE AND- YES WE'RE MAKING GREAT STRIDES IN ELECT AND IN ELECTRIC VEHICLES. BUT WE STILL ONLY HAVE LESS THAN A HUNDRED THOUSAND OF THEM AND SO. THE TIMING OF THIS IS VERY VERY CRITICAL WE ARE TOTALLY INVESTED IN MAKING LIQUID FUELS. AS CLEAN AS POSSIBLE. WE'RE TOTALLY INVESTED IN THINGS LIKE RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS RENEWABLE DIESEL HYDROGEN. WE ALSO ARE VERY INVESTED. IN AND FIVE THOUSAND THIS COMMITTEE AS PART OF MY COMMENTS. WRITEN COMMENTS AS THE GERMAN SUGGESTED. THE INNOVATIONS INITIATIVE WE PUT TOGETHER THAT CATALOGS WHAT THIS INDUSTRY IS DOING IN WIND AND SOLAR AND INVESTING IN ELECTRIC VEHICLE. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND ELECTRIC VEHICLE. CHARGING STATIONS. ALL OF THAT IS WONDERFUL OPTIMISTIC AND INNOVATIVE WHILE WE STILL HAVE TO KEEP ORDER FIRST AND FOREMOST. WE'VE GOT FORTY MILLION PEOPLE THAT WANT TO WAKE UP TOMORROW AND DRIVE SOMEWHERE AND SO. IT IS YOU KNOW GASOLINE DIESEL JET FUEL ARE GOING TO BE WITH US TO YOUR POINT. FOR QUITE A WHILE AS WE'RE DOING THIS. AS FAST AS FAR. AND YOU'RE SEEING IT THE CAP AND TRADE. LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD THEY ARE DELIVERING THE INNOVATIONS. YOU HAVE TO REFINERS- JUST CONVERTED A HYDROCARBON. BASED OUR REFINERIES IN THE BAY AREA TWO WERE LOCALS COMPLETELY RENEWABLES SO. THE INNOVATION IS STARTING IT IS IT IS HAPPENING YOU'VE GOT WONDERFUL INNOVATION HAPPENING WITH OUR OUR INDUSTRY IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY YOU'VE GOT CHEVRON AND SHELL. YOU KNOW AND NEW ENERGY AND MICROSOFT AND CLEAN ENERGY WHO JUST ANNOUNCED PLANS ON A BIOENERGY CCS PROJECT. TO GIVE CARBON NEGATIVE POWER TO MENDOTA. THAT'S EXCITING. YOU'VE GOT DODD C. R. C. WHO IS ANNOUNCED A SUSTAINABILITY GOAL TO CAPTURE THEIR CARBON FROM A FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY MEGAWATT POWER PLANT NOW KILLS SO. ALL OF THESE GET AT THE METRIC TONS THAT WE HAVE TO GET. IN A COMBINATION. OF EVERYTHING IN EVERY SECTOR SO. I HOPE THAT BEGINS TO ANSWERED I SEE GREAT INNOVATION FOR THE FUTURE I SEE OUR COMPANIES ALL OVER IT. AND IT'S EXCITING BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO REMEMBER WE GOT A LOT OF PEOPLE HERE. THAT WE ARE REQUIRED TO SUPPLY FUEL. IN ALL OF THESE SECTORS AND- YOU KNOW I THINK SOUTHWEST JUST ANNOUNCED THAT A GREAT THING FOR RENEWABLE JET FUEL SO AGAIN. SO MUCH GOING ON I'M VERY OPTIMISTIC BUT WE MUST KEEP A REALISTIC CONVERSATION GOING REAL TALK I THINK AS SOMEONE SAID EARLIER. ABOUT WHAT THE FACTS ARE OF WHERE WE ARE AND WHERE WE NEED TO GO. AGAIN IN THE FUTURE IF I CAN- KATHY THANK YOU FOR THAT- I KNOW- YOU KNOW FOR ME BECAUSE A LOT OF FOLKS IN MY- DISTRICT IN MY REGION THE DRIVE GAS POWERED VEHICLES I DO BOTH OF MY VEHICLES ARE BOTH GAS. A GAS POWERED. I'M SO EVERY TIME I GO TO THE GAS TANK AND I AND I PHILIP. IT'S THE MISSIONS THAT ARE COMING OUT OF MY TAIL PIPE THAT I AM I'M ACTUALLY PUTTING. CARBON INTO THE ATMOSPHERE THAT'S THAT'S ON. A FOR- FOR DOING I THINK WE ALL HAVE TO. HAVE TO RELY BUT I DON'T HAVE ANOTHER OPTION BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE. AN ELECTRIC POWERED POWERED VEHICLE- AND IF I CAN ASK MAYBE DIFFICULT QUESTION- BECAUSE- YOU KNOW I WAS- IN CONSERVATIVE POLITICS- BACK IN. THE NINETEEN NINETIES- AND I REMEMBER BACK IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES. I THAT THERE WAS AN AWFUL LOT OF TALK IN FACT HAD SEVERAL FRIENDS. THAT WORKED FOR DIFFERENT GROUPS- THAT WE'RE TRYING TO SKEW. OF THE PUBLIC RELATIONS IN REGARDS TO- THE QUESTION OF CLIMATE CHANGE- I KNOW THAT- THE OIL ALMOND BIG OIL BIG OIL'S REALLY BAD I GUESS BIG WHEELS REALLY BAD ALTHOUGH I USED A PRODUCT BIG WHEELS REALLY BAD- BUT IN THAT. IT IN THE NINETIES- A BIG OIL WAS FUNDING- SOME OF THAT WE KNOW THAT WE KNOW THAT THAT IS THAT IS TRUE. I MYSELF- IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES DID NOT BELIEVE THAT CLIMATE CHANGE. WAS WAS REAL THE IN THE TWO THOUSANDS I DIDN'T BELIEVE THAT CLIMATE CHANGE. I WAS REAL OF COURSE IS A MANY ARE AWARE- I ENDED UP HAVING SORT OF A RECKONING AFTER I WENT LOOKED AT THE SCIENCE MYSELF AND SAID NO ACTUALLY. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S VERY REAL WE HAVE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS THAT ARE INCREASING IT'S MY BEHAVIOR THAT IS CAUSING- THAT- AND- I'VE COME TO THE REALIZATION- OR EVOLUTION YOU MIGHT SAY. THAT I HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. I'VE ALSO SEEN THAT- WITH. WITH BIG OIL AS WELL. IN FACT A COUPLE YEARS AGO I REMEMBER BEING- IN- IN THE NETHERLANDS. ACT THAT DOES SHOW FOR THE RESEARCH FACILITY AND I WAS SHOCKED TO SEE. THAT A COMPANY LIKE SHELL WAS SAYING THAT THERE'S GOT TO BE THAT WE ARE PART OF THE PROBLEM- AND WE'VE GOT ALSO GOT TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION IN FACT WE'RE TALK TALKING ABOUT AN INTERNATIONAL GLOBAL PRICE ON CARBON. IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY IS LIKE FIFTY DOLLARS SO IT SEEMS TO ME THAT BIG OIL'S COME AROUND TO THIS IDEA. THAT SOMETHING HAS TO BE DONE AND SO IT SEEMS TO ME LIKE MAYBE A FOR US AS POLICYMAKERS. INSTEAD OF THINKING OF BIG WELL THE PROBLEM MAYBE WE- ALL. THINK OF BIG OIL AS MAYBE PART OF THE SOLUTION. AS WELL TO HELPS MITIGATE- THIS THIS EXISTENTIAL CRISIS THAT'S FACING US GIVE ANY THOUGHTS ON THAT. I YES THANK YOU. YOU ARTICULATED THAT QUITE WELL AND WE ARE VERY COMMITTED TO WORKING ON THIS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT ISSUE. IT'S WHY I PERSONALLY WITH MY COLLEAGUE WENT TO COP TWENTY FIVE- IN MADRID IT'S. BECAUSE IT'S SO IMPORTANT THAT WE ARE PART OF THE SOLUTION- WE WANT TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION WE CANNOT KEEP TALKING PAST EACH OTHER WE MUST TALK WITH EACH OTHER. BECAUSE IT IS ONLY OUR COLLECTIVE THINKING ON THIS IN MY OPINION THAT WILL SOLVE THIS PROBLEM AND THAT'S ALL OF US IN BECAUSE WE'RE ALL PART OF IT WE'RE ALL PART OF THOSE ISSUES A PART OF THE PROBLEM AS YOU SAID- AND WE HAVE TO ENGAGE. IN THOUGHTFUL DISCUSSION ON HOW WE'RE GOING TO DEAL WITH THIS. MY ONLY PLEASE IS THAT WE DO HAVE A PRAGMATIC SIDE OF THAT CONVERSATION THAT ALSO LOOKS AT THE ECONOMIC IMPACT AND I'M NOT SAYING ECONOMICS ABOVE ENVIRONMENTAL I'M SAYING ECONOMICS IN IN BALLOTS WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL AND WITH THE SOCIAL JUSTICE ISSUES THAT WEEK WE HAVE TO COME TO TERMS WITH BECAUSE IT'S- IT'S- ALL OF THEM. AND IT IN THAT AND I TRULY BELIEVE WE ALMOST HAVE A SEAT AT THE TABLE TO MAKE SURE WE'RE ALL HEARD WE ALL USE OUR COLLECTIVE THINKING. THAT WE DON'T ALL NOBODY HAS THE CORNER WAS DUMB I CERTAINLY DON'T OUR INDUSTRY CERTAINLY DOESN'T AND BUT WE DO BRING TO THE TABLE IN MY OPINION. JUST AMAZING INNOVATION AND AN OPPORTUNITY FOR HOW WE CAN ADDRESS THIS TOGETHER SO I'M- THAT'S MY OPTIMISTIC SIDE AND THEN MY PRAGMATIC SIDE IS TO JUST MAKE SURE WE ARE LOOKING AT THE FACTS OF THE SITUATION WHERE WE ARE WHERE WE NEED TO GO BECAUSE- IT ISN'T EASY. WE JUST CANNOT SWITCH OFF YOU KNOW FLIP A SWITCH AND HAVE THIS ALL HAPPEN TOMORROW WHEN YOU'VE GOT SUCH A WIDE RANGE OF. OF WHERE WE ARE AND WHERE WE NEED TO GO BUT THAT'S WHY I THINK THE PART SCOPING PLAN IS A GOOD ONE IT IS TO LOOK AT ALL THOSE DETAILS BUT THAT ON THE TABLE AND FIND A PATH WE CAN ALL AGREE WITH. AND NOBODY'S GONNA BE HAPPY IT'S GONNA BE A PATH THAT YOU KNOW THERE'S COMPROMISE ON ALL SIDES AND I THINK WHEN WE DO% THAT. WE WILL- IF WE BALANCE ECONOMY AND ENVIRONMENT AND SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EQUITY WE WILL HAVE THE PROGRAM. IT'S ONLY ONE WAY DON'T TAKE THE BALANCED APPROACH THAT WE END UP HAVING TOPIC. THANK YOU SO MUCH OF HIS CHAIR. THANK YOU- EVERYONE HI I AM. I MEAN I HAVE I I'VE JOTTED DOWN SO MANY NOTES FROM EACH ONE OF THE SPEAKERS AND I COULD TO YOU KNOW CONTINUE THIS OF THIS CONVERSATION FOR HOURS BUT THAT WE ARE LIMITED IN TIME AND SO I JUST WANT TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO THANK ALL ALL OF OUR OF OUR OUR SPEAKERS ON ON ON THE THIRD PANEL AND- LIKE A- IS REYES VOID- JUST. STATED THIS IS A CONVERSATION THIS TO TAKE ALL OF US TO. TO CONTINUE TO PRESENT PARTICIPATE RIGHT WERE. WERE ARE NOT GONNA HAVE ANY EASY SOLUTIONS- TODAY BUT THE REALLY APPRECIATE ALL OF YOU FOR- DISSIPATING AND TODAY'S CONVERSATION- SO I'D LIKE TO MOVE ON THEN- TO- PUBLIC COMMENT. AGAIN EACH. PERSON WHO WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A PUBLIC COMMENT- IS LIMITED TO A MINUTE- AND- WE WILL START WITH THOSE- OF YOU HERE AND THE HEARING ROOM IN PERSON THEN WILL GO TO THOSE APPEARING REMOTELY ON THE NORTH STEPS OF THE CAPITOL- IF ANY. AND FINALLY TO THOSE A CALLING AND BY PHONE SO I LIKE TO START TO- WITH THEM- IT DOESN'T PERSON. SIR OF PLEASE PROCEED. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS JASON LINDSAY ON THE OF PRESIDENT BUSINESS AGENT OF IRONWORKERS LOCAL THREE SEVENTY EIGHT. MY QUESTION IS WHY ARE WE NOT TRIPLING DOWN ON RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND GREEN HYDROGEN- RENEWABLES NATURAL GAS AND YES DARE I SAY IT NUCLEAR AND FOR HIM- WE NEED A SOLID PLAN IN PLACE TO TRANSITION FROM ONE ENERGY SOURCE TO ANOTHER- OTHERWISE IT'S ONLY HAVE BACON DOOMED TO FEEL DUE TO FAIL. THERE ARE FIVE REFINERIES IN MY JURISDICTION- ALWAYS HERE LOCALLY IS ONE SIDE SAYING SHUT IT DOWN AND US SAYING SAVE OUR JOBS- EVERY PART OF OUR SOCIETY IS EMBEDDED WITH PRODUCTS MADE FROM FOSSIL FUELS FROM THE CLOTHES WE WEAR. TO THE CHAIRS YOU ARE SITTING IN- IF WE FLIP THE SWITCH OR MAKE IT SO HARD FOR THIS INDUSTRY TO OPERATE IT WOULD BE THE EQUIVALENT OF QUITTING A JOB BEFORE WE HAVE ANOTHER ONE IN PLACE. THE OIL USAGE WON'T STOP IT WILL ONLY COME FROM DIRTY OR SOURCES AND COST A LOT MORE MONEY. FURTHER DRIVING A WEDGE BETWEEN THE HAVES AND THE HAVE NOTS THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR. EXPECT A PLACE. GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS MIKE WESTON I REPRESENT THE INTERNATIONAL UNION OF PAINTERS AND ALLIED TRADES I APPRECIATE DR FAMILIES- CLASSIFICATION AS CLIMATE CHANGE BEING A WORLDWIDE- CRISIS- THE FOR INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTIONS IN OUR WORLD HISTORY CAME FROM COAL AND THE STEAM ENGINE FROM SEVENTEEN SIXTY SO THE EIGHTEEN SEVENTIES. FOSSIL FUEL EXTRACTION THE CONDUCT INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE FOLLOWED UP WITH A BY MANUFACTURING INCREASES AND IN THE EIGHTEEN SEVENTIES TO THE NINETEEN FORTIES THE THIRD ONE BEING ELECTRONICS AND NUCLEAR- INNOVATIONS FROM THE NINETEEN FORTIES TO THE NINETEEN NINETIES AND THE NE THAT WERE IN CURRENTLY IS CALLED THE INTERNET AND RENEWABLE ENERGY INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION THE INTERNET LAUNCHED ON APRIL THIRTIETH NINETEEN NINETY THREE AND IS JUST TWENTY EIGHT YEARS OLD. I HAVE CHILDREN THAT ARE OLDER THAN THAT- THEN THE- INNER INCEPTION OF THE INTERNET WE DIDN'T THROW OUT ALL OF OUR ENCYCLOPEDIAS BEFORE WE GOT THE INTERNET AND SO BOTH THE SCIENTIFIC AND COMMON SENSE PLAN TO ACHIEVE CARBON REDUCTION GOALS WILL BE THE BEST SOLUTION FOR OUR STATE OUR ECONOMY AND OUR JOBS UNTIL FARM EQUIPMENT HEAVY HIGHWAY EQUIPMENT CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT AND INTERSTATE TRUCKING OR ELECTRIFIED AND THE CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE SUPPORTED BY OUR ALREADY FRAGILE POWER GRID. WE CANNOT JUST SIMPLY SHUT DOWN THE FOSSIL FUEL EXTRACTION AND REFINING HERE IN CALIFORNIA THE COST TO INCREASE THE CONSTRUCTION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING BY INCREASED FUEL COSTS WILL CONTINUE TO DRIVE THOSE HOME PRICES OUT OF REACH FOR MOST PEOPLE INCLUDING THOSE WERE IN THE BUILDING TRADES MANY OF WHICH COMMUTE TWO PLUS HOURSEACH WAY TO THE JOB SITE THEY WORK ON IN ORDER TO PROVIDE AN AFFORDABLE HOUSE FOR THEIR FAMILY THANK YOU. FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK THANKS SIR. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS ON KEVIN FERRER THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE SACRAMENTAL SEARS BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL. WE STAND IN SOLIDARITY WITH THE STATE BUILDING TRADES. AND WE'RE ASKING THE COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER THAT. BALIK ELECTRIFICATION OF OUR BUILDINGS AND CARS WILL COLLAPSE THE POWER GRID BLACKOUTS AND BROWNOUTS ARE BECOMING THE NEW NORM FOR FEAR OF OVER STRESSING OUR POWER GRIDS. THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR CO CHAIR OF ROB STOKER REPRESENTING SHEET METAL WORKERS LOCAL ONE OH FOUR AND ALSO PRESIDENT OF THE BUILDING CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL ALAMEDA COUNTY. SO CARBON NEUTRALITY SHOULD BE OF THE HIGHEST PRIORITY BUT HOW AND WHEN WE GET THERE IS EQUALLY AS IMPORTANT IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE HUNDRED AND SIX METRIC TONS OF CARBON WAS EMITTED INTO THE AIR NOT FROM PLANES TRAINS AND AUTOMOBILES BUT FROM WILDFIRES. WE MUST NOT CREATE POLICY AND TIME LINES THAT WILL HAVE DEVASTATING UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES FOR BLUE COLLAR WORKING WOMEN AND MEN. I LEARNED AS EARLY AS A SHEET METAL APPRENTICE THAT YOU USE EVERY TOOL IN THE TOOLBOX THAT MEANS CARBON CAPTURE RENEWABLE POWERS AND FUELS AND OTHER TECHNOLOGIES. WE NEED TO BE THOUGHTFUL AND STRATEGIC ON OUR PATH TO CARBON NEUTRALITY SO THAT WORKING FAMILIES ARE DEVASTATED AND LEFT BEHIND THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR. GOOD AFTERNOON THERE'S A MUG REALLY IN WITH PAIR'S NOW TRACED HER COUNSEL SIXTEEN. SOLIDARY WITH THE STATE BUILDING TRADES I THINK IS IMPORTANT WHEN WE DO OR DON'T CLIMATE CHANGE POLICIES THOUGH KEEP IN MIND THE FINANCIAL BURDEN THE PEOPLE CALIFORNIA WHAT THE BEARS RESOLVE THESE POLICIES. CALIFORNIA'S ALREADY ONE OF THE MOST EXPENSIVE STATES TO RESIDE IN OUR HOMES POPULATION SPIRALING OUT OF CONTROL MOST WORKING FAMILIES CANNOT AFFORD THE BILLS THAT THEY CURRENTLY HAVE LET ALONE THE COST OF AN ELECTRIC CAR. OR TO HAVE THEIR LECTURED BUILDING THEIR COMMUTE COSTS CONTINUE TO INCREASE WE NEED TO BE CAREFUL NOT TO MAKE IT MORE EXPENSIVE FOR THE WORKING FAMILIES THEY'RE BARELY HANGING ON WHILE MANY MIGHT BE ONE PAYCHECK AWAY FROM BEING HOMELESS THEMSELVES. THANK YOU THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MY NAME IS RESTING JOHNSON I'M SPEAKING HERE TODAY AS THE PRESIDENT OF THE NORTHEASTERN CALIFORNIA BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL. THE LARGEST COALITION TRADE CONSTRUCTION WORKERS IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. WE ARE THE ONLY PATHWAY TO THE MIDDLE CLASS AND SOME CALIFORNIA'S MOST REAL COMMUNITIES INCLUDING SOME OF THOSE HIT BY THE DEVASTATING WILDFIRES MADE WORSE BY THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE. AS WE LOOK TOWARDS THE FUTURE MARY NEEDS THE FOLLOWING INVESTMENTS ELECTRICAL GRID HARDENING. EXPANSION EVEY CHARGING NETWORKS INVESTMENTS IN WIND ENERGY CARBON CAPTURE PUBLIC STORAGE INC RETIRED GEN. WITH ALL THESE INVESTMENTS WE NEED THE LEGISLATURE TO REQUIRE STRICT LABOR STANDARDS OF MOST PERFORMING THE WORK. REQUIREMENTS THAT GO BEYOND PREVAILINGWAGE DEMAND SKILLED AND TRAINED LANGUAGE DEMANDING GATES SPENT WITH WORKERS THROUGH PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENTS COMMITTEE WORKFORCE IMPROVEMENTS AN ECCENTRIC. THANK YOU THANK YOU. SLOVAK COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS MITCHELL BECHTEL I'M HERE TODAY ON BEHALF THE IRON WORKERS LOCAL ONE EIGHTEEN AND TO STAND IN SOLIDARITY WITH THE STATE BUILDING TRADES. IT'S MY HOPE THAT THE COMMITTEE WILL CONSIDER INVESTING IN INCENTIVIZING MORE RESEARCH INTO CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE FOR INDUSTRIES THAT ARE FOUNDATIONAL IN NATURE. HI A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF THIS IS THE CONCRETE INDUSTRY THIS IS THE THIRD LARGEST PRODUCER OF CO TWO IN THE WORLD. RIGHT THE NEED FOR SUSTAINABLE RESOURCES IS GREATER THAN EVER AND WE SHOULD BE FINDING WAYS TO UPCYCLE AND INCORPORATE- CAPTURED CARBON INTO CONCRETE AND OTHER BUILDING TRADES MATERIALS. CURRENT MODELS ESTIMATE THAT NEARLY 70% OF THE AGGREGATE USING CONCRETE AS LIMESTONE. BUT THERE ARE COMPANIES TODAY IN CALIFORNIA THAT CREATE SYNTHETIC FIND STOLEN THROUGH CAPTURED CARBON RIGHT THIS IS A PERFECT MARRIAGE. HI YOU KNOW THIS TECHNOLOGY HAS ALREADY BEEN ANALYZED TESTED AND IMPLEMENTED ON HUGE MAJOR PROJECTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE- WHAT WE'RE REALLY LOOKING FOR IS FOR YOU GUYS TO PUSH THAT PUBLIC INVESTMENT. TO INCENTIVIZE COMPANIES TO USE THIS STUFF THANK YOU GUYS THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY MORE SPEAKERS IN THE HEARING ROOM. SAYING NONE OF LIKE TO TURN IT- TO ANY. SPEAKERS APPEARING REMOTELY ON THE NORTH STEPS OF THE CAPITOL. I DON'T SEE. ANYONE STEPPING FORWARD FOR SHOWING ON THE SCREEN. LAST BUT NOT LEAST ANY. PUBLIC COMMENTS FROM THOSE CALLING IN BY PHONE AGAIN THE PHONE NUMBER IS. 877-692-8957 ACCESS CODE. ONE THREE ONE FIVE FOUR THREE SEVEN. SERRET OPERATOR. YES MICHAEL LINE NUMBER OF SEVENTY TWO AGAIN LINE NUMBER SEVENTY TWO YOUR LINE IS OPEN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THIS IS BILL MCGOVERN WITH THE COALITION FOR CLEAN AIR. AND I THINK THAT IT'S EALLY TRUE THAT WE ARE AT THIS POINT NOT ON TRACK TO REACH THE SB THIRTY TO TARGET SO LET ME FOCUS ON A FEW THINGS THAT THE LEGISLATURE. SHOULD DO TO ADDRESS THAT- ONE I THINK IS YOU COULD PAST CHAIRMAN BIRDS TO CHOOSE BILL AB THIRTEEN NINETY FIVE. AT THE BROAD LEVEL AND THEN LOOKING AT THE SECTORS WHERE WE NEED THE MOST HELP. BUT TRANSPORTATION EMISSIONS HAVE BEEN GROWING AND SO THE LEGISLATURE COULD HELP. BY TAKING ACTION TO HELP PROVIDE TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS TO REDUCE THE MILES TRAVELED BY OUR VEHICLES CAN ALSO BY CONTINUING TO PROVIDE INCENTIVE FUNDING. FOR THE TURNOVER OF OLDER DIRTIER VEHICLES TO QUEEN ELECTRIC TRANSPORTATION- THIS YEAR'S BUDGET PROVIDED BILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND WE NEED TO CONTINUE THAT FUNDING INCLUDING BY RE AUTHORIZING THE AB EIGHT PROGRAM. THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR ALSO NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED AND BY DIRECT EMISSION REDUCTIONS RATHER THAN OUTSOURCING INITIAL REDUCTIONS TO OTHER STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES DIRECT PRODUCTIONS ARE MORE EFFECTIVE AND MORE EQUITABLE AND THEY ARE NOT ABOUT. RAISING COSTS FOR LONG DISTANCE COMMUTERS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. X. COLUMN LINE NUMBER OF EIGHTY ONE CANALI NUMBER EIGHTY ONE YEAR LATER OPEN. HI THIS IS JASON VARGAS WITH THE UNION OF CONCERNED SCIENTISTS THANKS FOR THE HEARING TODAY AN OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT- YOU GOT SOME MEMBERS THAT KNOWLEDGE THERE LATER IN THE HEARING- YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA'S LONG BEEN A LEADER IN ADDRESSING THE THREAT OF CLIMATE CHANGE. BUT THE TRUTH IS THAT OUR OUR CLUB CURRENT AMBITION IS AN INSUFFICIENT RESPONSE TO THE CASCADING EMERGENCY OF CLIMATE CHANGE. IN FACT MANY OTHER STATES AND COUNTRIES ARE NOW MORE AMBITIOUS AND A GLOBAL WARMING EMISSIONS REDUCTION TARGETS CALIFORNIA. EVEN THE BY THE MINISTRATIONS TARGET FOR TWENTY THIRTY IT'S MORE AMBITIOUS THE. CALIFORNIA SB THIRTY TWO AND- CALIFORNIA AGREE WITH MANY OF THE SPEAKER THAT- I THANK YOU SEE AT THE TWENTY THE SPEAKERS TODAY THAT. CALIFORNIA IS NOT ON TRACK TO MEET THE STATE'S EXISTING TWENTY THIRTY ONE. I AFFECT WE BELIEVE THAT ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT OBJECTIVES THAT THAT THE OPEN PLAN UPDATE. IT A GREAT AMBITIOUS AND DETAILED PLANS. TO MEET EMISSION REDUCTION LIMITS BY TWENTY THIRTY- WE WILL- ECHO THE COMMENTS MADE AND I'M GONNA GO BACK ON THE GATHERED THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT STEP- OVER THE LEGISLATURE BLACK MONTH. IT'S PAST EIGHTY THIRTEEN NINETY FIVE TO CODIFY THE STATE'S COMMITMENT TO ACHIEVE NET ZERO GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS NO LATER THAN TWENTY POINT FIVE. CONTRIBUTE. TO GLOBAL EFFORTS TO KEEP WARMING BELOW TWO DEGREES CELSIUS. CALIFORNIA REALLY MARKET AGGRESSIVELY ACCELERATED COMMITMENT TO REDUCE EMISSIONS. I CAN CREATE THE OPPORTUNITY. I AM NOT AN OPPORTUNITY NOT JUST FOCUSED SOLELY A TECHNOLOGICAL SHIFT BUT ALSO THE SYSTEMIC CHANGES THAT ONE MIGHT GREATER CLIMATE AMBITION AND- THEIR OUTCOMES FOR ALL. THANK YOU AGAIN THANK YOU. LOCALI NUMBER EIGHTY THREE ARE DEADLINE NUMBER EIGHT THREE YOUR LINE IS OPEN. GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THIS IS JENNIFER FEARING ON BEHALF OF THE CENTER FOR FOOD SAFETY AND- I KEEP FINDING IN THE NEWLY RELEASED AUDI T REPORTED THAT METHANE EMISSIONS AMID HUGE CONTRIBUTION TO CURRENT FORMING. 3250% OF THE CURRENT RISE IN TEMPERATURES OF COD BY THIS POWERFUL THE SHORE THE GAS. AND AS YOU WELL KNOW ANIMAL AGRICULTURE PARTICULARLY CONFINED ANIMAL FEEDING OPERATIONS ARE CAPABLE ARE MAJOR CONTRIBUTORS TO METHANE EMISSIONS AND THEIR LOCATIONS CREATES SERIOUS COMMUNITY HEALTH HAZARDS WHICH EQUITABLY HARM BONOBO CALIFORNIANS. TODAY CALIFORNIA'S PRIMARY INVESTMENT- BAG METHANE EMISSIONS HAVE BEEN BURIED I JESTERS FACILITIES THAT CREATE BIOGAS FROM THE NEWER EMISSIONS AT LARGE PAPERS. AND WE JOINT ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COLLEAGUES IN COMMUNITIES AROUND THE STATE IN OPPOSING FURTHER TAXPAYER AND RATEPAYER INVESTMENT BECAUSE BIO GAS IS NOT CLEAN. DIGEST OR DO NOT ADDRESS ENTERIC EMISSIONS FROM CALIBER OTHER GHG EMISSIONS FROM DERRY AND ONLY VERY LARGE DAIRIES CAN PROVIDE ENOUGH MINORITY GIVE DIED AFTER TECHNOLOGY ANY PRAYER PENCILING OUT ECONOMICALLY. SO THAT MEANS THAT DIGEST CERTAIN CENTER BY JERRY TO GET BIGGER AND MORE CONCENTRATED IN ADDING MORE AND MORE ENTERIC METHANE CAUSING SERIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT PARTICULARLY IN NEARBY COMMUNITIES. CONTAMINATING GROUNDWATER EMITTING AIR CONTAMINANTS BEYOND METHANE ATTRACTING HEAVY DUTY TRUCK TRAFFIC AND PRODUCING ODORS ALL OF THESE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES TO PRODUCE A GAS THAT EMITS CARBON. DIOXIDE UPON COMBUSTION. HELLO HAS BEEN ON THE ADMIT THEY RELAX STRATEGY AND WE SHOULD OUR LOS. WE URGE YOU ALL IN THE LEGISLATURE ADMINISTRATION TO RESIST THE MAN'S FOR FURTHER INVESTMENT IN DIRTY DEAL FROM DIED YESTERDAY AT THE FINALIZED THE CLIMATE RESILIENCE PACKAGE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

THANK YOU MELISSA ROMERO WITH THE CALIFORNIA LEAGUE OF CONSERVATION VOTERS- SO I WANT TO SAY FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HOLDING THIS HEARING FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT. WE MUST ACT SWIFTLY AND DECISIVELY TO DRASTICALLY REDUCE EMISSIONS IT WILL BE COSTLY IT WILL REQUIRE A GREAT DEAL OF COLLABORATION ACROSS INDUSTRIES ACROSS IN YOUR INTEREST BUT THE ALTERNATIVE OF INSTALLING SHORT IS MUCH MORE COSTLY AND THAT INCLUDES A LOSS OF HUMAN LIFE. WHICH WE ABSOLUTELY SHOULD NOT ACCEPT WE CAN WE CAN BUILD A BETTER FUTURE AND WE MUST NOT LET CORPORATE POLLUTERS CONVINCED THAT THIS IS NOT A WORTHWHILE EFFORT. WE HAVE TO BE HONEST WITH OURSELVES ABOUT THE SCALE OF EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS THAT WILL BE REQUIRED TO ACHIEVE CARBON NEUTRALITY AND THE STATE CLIMATE GOALS THAT ARE ALREADY IN PLACE. THE REALITY IS THAT THE MAJORITY OF THE WORK TO ACHIEVING CARBON NEUTRALITY MUST BE CARBON EMISSIONS WE ARE TO ACHIEVE THE TARGET. AND WHEN CONSIDERING TECHNOLOGICAL SOLUTIONS FOR CARBON REMOVAL IN ADDITION TO MAJOR BANKS CARNAVAL WHICH HAVE HUGE POTENTIAL NOT ONLY REMOVING CARBON EMISSIONS BUT ALSO A MULTITUDE OF COMPANIES THAT IT IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL THAT THE LEGISLATURE WAY THEN TO ENSURE THAT THE USE OF TECHNOLOGICAL SOLUTIONS THAT'S NOT CONTINUE OUR RELIANCE ON FOSSIL FUELS. AND DOES NOT INCREASE TOXIC AIR POLLUTION WE CANNOT CONTINUE BUSINESS AS USUAL AND WE'RE LOOKING FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO PROVIDE TESTIFIED THE DIRECTION TO ENSURE THAT. HìNH IS NOT THE CASE. TIME COMING. CALIFORNIA PROVEN. ARGUE AGAIN CLIMATE BY. AND WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO IT I'M ACTUALLY LARGELY QUICKLY ACCOUNT OF THE NATION'S LARGEST CORPORATION BETTER RIGHT NOW PUTTING SMALL BUSINESSES OUT OF BUSINESS. BETTER UNDERPAYMENTS READING WORKERS ARE THE ONES WHO ARE MOST RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MAJORITY OF CARBON EMISSIONS. WHICH HAVE CAUSED THE CLIMATE CRISIS PLEASE PLEASE. CONTINUE OKAY. WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME MAKING DECISIONS WHICH WILL IMPACT NOT TO FUTURE GENERATIONS BUT RIGHT NOW CURRENT GENERATION- AND WE REJECT THE NOTION THAT ADDRESSING CLIMATE SCALE AND TAKE NECESSARY.

AVOIDING A SEQUENCE OF POLICIES THAT WOULD PRODUCE OUT WINDOWS LEAGUE. LEAKAGE OR INFIGHTING HIGHER GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS FROM OUT OF THE REGION AND UNINTENTIONALLY REDISTRIBUTING ENERGY TO. SUPPLY OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA IT IS CRITICAL THAT WE FOCUS ON DEMAND AND BUILD UP OUR DOMESTIC. ENERGY OUR CAPACITY IN THE OTHER FIRST STEP HERE IN THE END- BUT OUR QUEST FOR NET ZERO. POINT EVENTUALLY WE ALSO NEED CONSISTENT STRONG REPRESENTATION OF LABOUR ACROSS ALL PLANNING POLICY AND IMPLEMENTATION IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE AS PRETTY WELL ARTICULATED BY EARLIER SPEAKERS.

WINDFARM PROJECTS HAVE BEEN CANCELLED BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN LABELED AS BIRD BINDERS HYDRO PROJECTS HAVE BEEN SHOT DOWN BECAUSE THEY'RE LABELED AS FISHMONGERS. CARBON CAPTURE FACILITIES HAVE BEEN SCRAPPED BECAUSE THEY WILL PROLONG LIFE REFINERIES. I POINT IS THIS ENVIRONMENTALISTS DON'T WANT TO BUILD ANYTHING. YOU WANNA SHUT EVERYTHING DOWN WITHOUT A WAY TO REPLACE THE LOSS OF ENERGY USAGE ANY POLICY ON CLIMATE IS ALSO POLICY ON ENERGY AND THEREFORE ORGANIZED LABOR SHOULD HAVE A SEAT AT THE TABLE TO HELP PROMOTE THE MOST. REALISTIC WAY TO REMAIN ENERGY EFFICIENT. WE WANT TO BUILD AND CLIMATE IN. BUT WE NEED A SEAT AT THE TABLE TO HELP INSURE DAY ACTUALLY GET BUILT THANK YOU AND I DID HAVE ONE QUESTION I DIDN'T HEAR ANYBODY ADDRESS WITH ALL THE ELECTRIC VEHICLES. THAT'S THE FUTURE POLICY.
