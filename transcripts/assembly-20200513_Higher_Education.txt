THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN CALLING. WE KNOW ONLY TOO WELL THE BASIC NEEDS AND SECURITY HAS A DIRECT IMPACT ON STUDENT ACADEMIC SUCCESS. IN THE HARSH REALITY IS A COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS ARE STRUGGLING TO MEET THEIR BASIC NEEDS AT ALARMING RATES. RELEASED IN MARCH TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN BY THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE AND THE HOPE CENTER FOR COLLEGE COMMUNITY AND JUSTICE. FOUND A 19% OF THE SURVEY STUDENTS RESPONDENTS EXPERIENCED HOMELESSNESS IN THE PREVIOUS YEAR. 60% OF STUDENTS WERE HOUSING AND SECURE IN THE PREVIOUS YEAR AND 50% OF STUDENTS WHO ARE FOOD INSECURE IN THE PRIOR THIRTY DAYS. THESE NUMBERS ARE HEARTBREAKING AND IS CAMPUS IS A PHYSICALLY CLOSED AND MOVED ONLINE CLASSES DURING THE CLOVER NINETEEN CRISIS. THE EXISTING BASIC NEEDS CHALLENGES THEIR STUDENTS FACE HAS BECOME EVEN MORE PRONOUNCED AND URGENTLY REQUIRE ACTION. COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE STEPPING UP TO MEET THE BASIC NEEDSOF THEIR STUDENTS THROUGH FOOD PANTRIES HOUSING RELATED EFFORTS AND OTHER SERVICES AND RESOURCES. HOWEVER FINDING THESE RESOURCES OFTEN INCLUDES NAVIGATING DISCONNECTED SYSTEMS THAT CAN BE CONFUSING FOR STUDENTS. THEREFORE AB TWENTY THREE EIGHTY EIGHT WOULD PROVIDE A COORDINATED AND INTEGRATED APPROACH TO MEET STUDENTS BASIC NEEDS BY ESTABLISHING A BASIC NEED CENTER AND BASIC MEANS COORDINATOR ON EACH COMMUNITY COLLEGE CAMPUS ON OR BEFORE. JULY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THE BASIC NEEDS COORDINATOR WOULD ACT AS A BROKER AND IDENTIFYING SUPPORTING AND LINKING STUDENTS TO ON AND OFF CAMPUS SERVICES AND RESOURCES. THE BASIC NEEDS CENTER IS INTENDED TO BE A ONE STOP CENTRALIZED LOCATION FOR STUDENTS TO MORE EASILY ACCESS IN AWARENESS AND BE CONNECTED TO EXISTING SERVICES AND RESOURCES. UNDER THIS BILL COMMUNITY COLLEGES WILL ALSO DEVELOP A DOCUMENT THAT CLEARLY LISTS ALL ON AND OFF CAMPUS BASIC NEEDS SERVICES AND RESOURCES THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE AT THE CENTER AS WELL AS ON THE CAMPUSES WEBSITE AND STUDENT PORTAL. AB TWENTY THREE EIGHTY EIGHT ALSO IDENTIFIES POTENTIAL FUNDING SOURCES THEY CAMPUSES MAY USED TO ESTABLISH THE CENTER IN COORDINATOR SUCH AS STUDENT EQUITY AND ACHIEVEMENT PROGRAM FUNDING AS WELL AS GIFTS AND DONATIONS. THE IDEA OF A COORDINATED AND INTEGRATED APPROACH IS NOT NEW. IN FACT FIFTY THREE COMMUNITY COLLEGES HAVE REPORTED HAVING SOME FORM OF BASIC NEEDS CENTER. DURING THESE UNPRECEDENTED IN CHALLENGING TIMES COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS ACROSS ALL CAMPUSES NEED OUR SUPPORT NOW MORE THAN EVER. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE AND I'M HONORED TO BE JOINED BY TWO COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS.

I DO WISH THAT WE COULD SUPPORT IT WITH MONEY FROM ANOTHER PLACE- HIGH- DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT IT THE LOTTERY YOU CAN AS THE MARKET ALLOW PEOPLE TO DREAM AND HAVE A DIVERSION WHICH SOMETHING WE ALL PROBABLY NEED A LITTLE BIT MORE OF RIGHT NOW. THAT WE KNOW- REALLY PRAISE UPON THE POOREST CALIFORNIANS AND TAKES MONEY FROM THE POOREST CALIFORNIANS AND IF WE COULD JUST FUND OUR SCHOOLS HAD JUST GENERALLY- BETTER WE WOULDN'T HAVE TO RELY ON A LOTTERY THAT TAKES MONEY FROM THE POOR- ESSENTIALLY JUST.

YES MISTER CHAIR- I'M A NO I'M A NOT VOTE ON THIS ONE I WANT TO LET YOU KNOW WHY I HAD CONCERNS- NUMBER ONE IS THE LOTTERY RECENTLY THROUGH THE STATE COMPTROLLER AND THE- GOVERNOR AND I'M NOT QUITE SURE WHERE THE LEGISLATURE- CAME IN ON THIS LOWERED PRIZES AND EDUCATION FROM 87% 84% AND REALLY TROUBLING TO ME IS OVERHEAD FOR THE LOTTERY. WENT FROM 30% 216% THAT'S A 6% CHUNK OUT OF THE MONEY THAT WAS GOING BASICALLY THE EDUCATION THAT CONCERNS ME GREATLY. ALSO THERE MAY BE A QUESTION DOWN THE ROAD ABOUT THE CONSTITUTIONALITY- SPECIFICALLY AB ONE FORTY TWO HIGH I SEE IN. TWO THOUSAND TEN. CHANGE THE LOTTERY WITHOUT A VOTE OF THE PEOPLE NOW HOWEVER AB ONE FORTY TO INCREASE PRIZE AWARDS SO IT'S UNLIKELY THE PUBLIC WOULD HAVE SUED SO THE LEGISLATURE KIND OF SLID BY THAT ONE. NOT QUITE SURE HOW THIS WOULD GO. ON AND THEN FINALLY IT JUST TO WRAP IT UP. HELPING THE HOMELESS PROVIDING FOOD ASSISTANCE AND HOUSING ARE WORTHY CAUSES AND I SUPPORT THOSE CAUSES BUT IT'S NOT PART OF THE MAIN MISSION OF COMMUNITY COLLEGES. THERE MAIN MISSION IS TO PROVIDE EDUCATION AND MY CONCERN IS IF YOU GET OFF INTO THE WEEDS HERE. YOU'RE NOT AS EFFECTIVE IN EDUCATING OUR SERVICES THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR.

I BELIEVE THE FORMULA WILL ALLOW FOR PREDICTABILITY. SENSE OF SOMETHING THAT IS CRUCIAL. AS WE ALL SEEK WAYS TO BOUNCE BACK FROM THE DEVASTATION TO OUR ECONOMY. DO TO COPE WITH NINETEEN. THIS MEASURE WILL ASSIST STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES. AS A PLAN FOR THEIR EDUCATIONAL GOALS AND PROVIDES EQUITY FOR STUDENTS. I DO HAVE A MOTION FOR THIS BILL. FIRST AND SECOND MATTER THE- MOTION BEFORE US IS DO PASSED TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE BUT I'M SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE MEDINA HI MEDINA I WILL TELL. WILL TELL HI ARAMBULA ARAMBULA HI BLOOM BLOOM HI GABRIEL GABRIEL HI EARLY.

THANK YOU MADAM SECRETARY THE BILL PASSES YOUR BILL IS OUT- I WILL LEAVE THE ROLE OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS. THE NEXT BILL IN FILE IN ORDER. TO BE HEARD IS AB TWENTY FOUR SIXTEEN. ASSEMBLY MEMBER GABRIEL WHEN YOU'RE READY PLEASE BEGIN. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I AM PLEASED TODAY 2% AB TWENTY FOUR SIXTEEN WHICH WILL REQUIRE COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO CONSIDER HOMELESSNESS AS AN EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCE WHEN DETERMINING WHETHER A STUDENT SHOULD LOSE THEIR FINANCIAL AID FOR FAILURE TO MEET CERTAIN ACADEMIC BENCHMARKS. UNDER CURRENT LAW STUDENTS ARE REQUIRED TO ACHIEVE SATISFACTORY ACADEMIC PROGRESS OR SAT TO REMAIN ELIGIBLE FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. EVERY YEAR THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIA STUDENTS LOSE THEIR FINANCIAL AID BECAUSE THEY FAIL TO MAINTAIN SATISFACTORY ACADEMIC PROGRESS. A STUDENT WHO FALLS BELOW ESSAY P. MAY FILE AN APPEAL ASKING TO RETAIN THEIR FINANCIAL AID BASED ON EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES. WHAT MAY BE CONSIDERED EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES CURRENTLY VARIES WIDELY FROM CAMPUS TO CAMPUS AS INDIVIDUAL INSTITUTIONS ARE PROVIDED WITH SIGNIFICANT FLEXIBILITY TO DETERMINE WHAT FACTORS MAY BE CONSIDERED FOR PURPOSES OF RETAINING FINANCIAL AID. AB TWENTY FOUR SIXTEEN WOULD PROVIDE GUIDANCE TO CALIFORNIA'S INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION BY REQUIRING THEM TO CONSIDER STAINLESS STUDENT HOMELESSNESS AS AN EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCE. THIS CHANGES WARRANTED GIVEN THE EXTRAORDINARY IMPACT OF HOMELESSNESS CAN HAVE ON STUDENT SUCCESS THE ROLE THE HIGHER EDUCATION COMPLAIN LIFTING STUDENTS AND FAMILIES OUT OF POVERTY AND THE MAGNITUDE OF OUR STATE HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS CRISIS. WHICH IS LIKELY TO BE EXACERBATED BY THE COVERT NINETEEN CRISIS. INDEED THIS COMMITTEE HAS REPEATEDLY HER TESTIMONY ABOUT THE BROAD AND DEVASTATING IMPACT OF STUDENT HOMELESSNESS IN CALIFORNIA. WHICH IMPACTS NEARLY 20% OF OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS AND MORE THAN ONE IN TEN AT CSCO. WE ALSO KNOW THAT STUDENTS FROM HISTORICALLY UNDER REPRESENTED COMMUNITIES ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED BY HOMELESSNESS IN AN ONGOING ACCESS TO FINANCIAL AID IS A CENTRAL FOR LOW INCOME STUDENTS TO REMAIN ENROLLED IN GRADUATE. IN SHORT AB TWENTY FOUR SIXTEEN IS A MODEST BUT IMPORTANT MEASURE THAT WILL MAKE IT EASIER FOR STUDENTS WHO ARE STRUGGLING WITH HOMELESSNESS. AND ALL OF THE RELATED CHALLENGES TO REMAIN ENROLLED ACHIEVE ACADEMIC SUCCESS TO PULL THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES OUT OF POVERTY. WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THIS LEGISLATION ARE DEBBIE ROCKER FROM JOHN BURTON ADVOCATES FOR YOUTH. AND TISSUE ORTIZ A STUDENT FROM CSU HE EXPECTS. THANK YOU RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE BOTH. THANK YOU SIMPLY MEMBER GABRIEL EIGHTEEN T. MODERATOR THE FIRST WITNESS CALLING IN FOR AB TWENTY FOUR SIXTEEN IS DEBBIE RUPTURE. PROJECT DIRECTOR WITH THE JOHN BURTON ADVOCATES FOR YOUTH. AS ROGER PLEASE PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MY NAME IS DEBBIE RUSHER AND I'M WITH JOHN BURTON ADVOCATES FOR YOUTH APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY. IN THE FACE OF COVER NINETEEN AND THE CONSEQUENT LOSS OF INCOME FOR MANY COLLEGE STUDENTS THE RATE OF HOMELESSNESS AMONG STUDENTS IS LIKELY TO RISE. EVEN PRIOR TO THE CRISIS 19% OF STUDENTS A COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND 11% OF CSU STUDENTS REPORTED EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. 60% OF COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS REPORTED HOUSING AND SECURITY. FOR THE STUDENTS AND THE MANY MORE LIKE TO FACE SOME OF THIS IN THE YEARS AHEAD I'M GOING ACTIONS TO FINANCIALLY ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL TO THEIR ABILITY TO REMAIN INVOLVED. IN IT EVERY YEAR THOUSANDS OF THE STUDENTS LOSE ACCESS TO FINANCIAL AID BECAUSE THEY FALL BELOW THE SATISFACTORY ACADEMIC PROGRESS STANDARDS. MY WORK WITH COLLEGE CAMPUSES STAFF AND FACULTY CHARGED WITH SUPPORTING THE STUDENTS REPORT THE LOSS FINANCIAL AID IS A MAJOR BARRIER TO CONTINUED INVOLVEMENT. ALMOST COLLEGES OFFER THE OPPORTUNITY TO APPEAL ACOSTA FINANCIAL AID TO SAP APPEALS PROCESS FEES VARY TREMENDOUSLY BY CAMPUS. CULTURE GIVEN SIGNIFICANT LATITUDE UNDER FEDERAL REGULATIONS TO DEFINE THE CRITERIA FOR A SUCCESSFUL APPEAL BUT MANY DO NOT TAKE AND DID NOT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS FLEXIBILITY. WHEN A STUDENT EXPERIENCES HOMELESSNESS GRAY IT'S OFTEN DROP HOWEVER HOMELESSNESS IS NOT UNIVERSALLY DEFINED BY COLLEGES IS A SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCE. THE WARRANTS A STUDENT BEING GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAINTAIN FINANCIALLY IN ORDER TO REMAIN ENROLLED AND REGAIN ACADEMIC STANDING. STILL VERY HOMELESSNESS SHOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET BACK ON TRACK RATHER THAN THEIR EXPERIENCE OF HOMELESSNESS MEANING THE END OF THEIR ACADEMIC CAREER. CONTINUED ACCESS TO FINANCIAL AID IS A VITAL TOOL TO ALLOW THE STUDENTS TO REMAIN ENROLLED THE TROOPS ARE ACADEMIC STANDING. AB TWENTY FOUR SIXTEEN WILL OFFER STUDENTS WHO EXPERIENCE HOMELESSNESS THIS OPPORTUNITY THANK YOU. THANK YOU MS ROGER EIGHTEEN T. MODERATOR THE SECOND WITNESS CALLING IN THIS TO SHIP FORTIES.

NINETEEN THIRTY. AB NINETEEN THIRTY WILL INCREASE THE OVERSIGHT A PUBLIC UNIVERSITY'S ADMISSION AND ELIGIBILITY POLICIES TO ENSURE THE POLICY CHANGES ARE EQUITABLE AND DO NOT HAVE NEGATIVE. OR AN INTENDED IMPACT ON UNDER REPRESENTED STUDENT POPULATIONS. LAST YEAR THE CALIFORNIASTATE UNIVERSITY PROPOSED A NEW QUANTITATIVE REASONING ADMISSIONS ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS FOR FRESHMAN APPLICANTS. THIS PROPOSAL WOULD REQUIRE FUTURE INCOMING FRESHMEN AT THE CSU TO COMPLETE AN ADDITIONAL YEAR OF QUANTITATIVE REASONING. THE LEGISLATURE VOICE MANY CONCERNS ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL AND THE IMPACT THAT IT COULD HAVE ON UNDER REPRESENTED STUDENTS. WELL THE CSU ULTIMATELY DECIDED TO DELAY THE VOTE ON THIS PROPOSAL AND TOOK FURTHER STEPS TO EVALUATE ITS IMPACT THE STATE NEEDS TO DEVELOP A CLEAR AND TRANSPARENT PROCESS FOR HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS TO FOLLOW. WHEN CONSIDERING THE ADOPTION OF NEW ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS. FOR PROPOSALS WITH THE STAKES IS HIGH IS THIS MORE TIME AND EVALUATION IS NEEDED PRIOR TO REACHING A DECISION. AB NINETEEN THIRTY WILL ENSURE THAT THE MISSION OF THE ELIGIBILITY POLICIES ARE MORE TRANSPARENT. HAVE PROPER OVERSIGHT AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS INCLUDE COORDINATED IMPLEMENTATION PLANS WITH PUBLIC ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION SYSTEMS WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO BUILD UPON OUR GOOD WORK AND ENSURE THAT OUR PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES REMAIN ENGINES OF ECONOMIC MOBILITY FOR UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS AND NOT INCREASE BARRIERS TO ACCESS TO ACCESS.

THE PUBLIC ALSO DEMANDS AND DEMANDS THAT HIGHER EDUCATION AND OUR K. TWELVE SCHOOL SHOULD BE WORKING TOGETHER. WE HAVE A COMMON GOAL WITH CHAIR MEDINA AND SUPPORT AT THIS BILL IT IS ACT ACCESS TO OUR PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES NOT JUST INSTITUTION INTEREST.

ADDITIONALLY WE ALSO LIKE TO THANK CHAIRMAN DEAN THE FIRST COMMITMENT TO HIGHER EDUCATION ALWAYS SUPPORTING OUR STUDENTS AND FINING PATHWAYS THAT WILL LEAD TO THEIR SUCCESS. WITH THAT SAID IT'S NOT EASY TO OPPOSE ANY BILL PUT FORTH BY GERMAN DINA. AT THE OP THERE IS MENTION THE IMPETUS FOR THE BILL IN PART- OR THE ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE CSU BOARD OF TRUSTEES IN JANUARY TO REQUIRE AN ADDITIONAL YEAR WANTED KATE OF REASONING. AS PART OF THE ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS YES YOU. SIR COULD YOU MENTION BY THE BOARD BENEFITTED SIR COULD YOU WRAP UP YOUR COMMENTS. I'M SORRY BUT THERE'D BE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR OPPOSITION.

BY THE BOARD BENEFIT FROM STAKEHOLDER INPUT AND HAVE BEEN REVISED ON MULTIPLE OCCASIONS BEFORE AN- IMPLEMENTATION PLAN. WAS ADOPTED THIS PAST JANUARY. AS WE EVALUATE AB NINETEEN THIRTY WE FIND THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF SIMILARITIES THE PLAN THAT WE'VE ALREADY IMPLEMENTED SUCH AS FIFTY IF YOU WILL BE INCORPORATING A STEERING COMMITTEE TO PROVIDE IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE. AND PROVIDE AND MONITORED METRIC TO ASSESS THE IMPACT AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THE REQUIREMENT. IS INTENDED THAT THE STEERING COMMITTEE WOULD BE MADE UP OF MULTIPLE STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING STATE OFFICIAL PK TWELVE- DISTRICT PERSONNEL STUDENTS FACULTY AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS. INCREASED TRANSPARENCY THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF ANNUAL REPORTS TO A BOARD TRUSTEES AND AN EXTRA REVIEW BY A NONPARTISAN RESEARCH ORGANIZATION TO INFIRM INFORM THE AND IMPLEMENTATION. OVER EIGHTY NINETEENTH WOULD APPLY REQUIREMENTS TO NOT ONLY CHANGES TO EIGHT EIGHT THREE JUNE POLICIES. BUT ANY AND ALL ELIGIBILITY ADMISSIONS POLICIES.

IDEA THANK YOU FOR CALM MODERATOR THEIR OF TWEENER ON THE FOR OR INDICATE. NO FURTHER TRAINERS IN THE QUEUE. THANK YOU MODERATOR. TO THE COMMITTEE ARE THERE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. YES SIR. YEAH THANK YOU MISTER VICE CHAIR AND ALSO THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR FOR INTRODUCING THIS THOUGHTFUL CONVERSATION I REALLY STRUGGLED WITH THIS BILL- I DON'T UNFORTUNATELY I'M GONNA BE ABLE TO SUPPORT IT TODAY- I THINK THAT WHAT WE SAW THIS YEAR'S USE PROPOSAL WAS A WAY TO. ACHIEVE THE GOAL THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS ASKED OF IT WHICH IS TO SPEED UP GRADUATION RATES AND SO THEY WANTED TO FIND A WAY TO PREPARE STUDENTS BETTER FOR WHEN THEY WOULD GET TO COLLEGE SO THAT THEY COULD- COMPLETE COLLEGE THEN DROPPING OUT. AND THEY SEND COMMUNITY WHICH IS YOU KNOW WHAT WE REALLY WANT OUR INSTITUTIONS TO DO A PARTICULARLY LA U. S. D. WHICH SAID WE JUST SIMPLY CAN'T PROVIDE THESE CLASSES RIGHT NOW I WHICH IS VERY SAD TO HEAR US YES YOU HEARD THAT THEY CHANGED THEIR RECOMMENDATION AND- AND SO THEY'RE NOT IMPLEMENTING THAT REQUIREMENT- AT THE TIME THAT THEY WANTED TO. WHICH IS GOING TO HURT OUR ABILITY TO GET TO THE GRADUATION RATE GOAL THAT WE HAVE AND OF COURSE TO GET O. THE WORK FORCE THAT WE WANT CALIFORNIA TO HAVE. FOR THE FUTURE GENERATION OF CALIFORNIAN THE ECONOMIC MIGHT OF THE STATE AND ENGAGE CITIZENRY. THAT THE STATE DESERVES. I WANT TO THROW OPEN THE GATES OF HIGHER EDUCATION TO EVERYBODY. I ABSOLUTELY DO AND- AND SO WE HAVE AS AS- IN OUR JOBS IN THE PAST FEW YEARS. DONE EVERYTHING WE CAN TO DO THAT CREATE MORE SEATS AVAILABLE AT CSU. AND YOU SEE AND MAKE OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE AS AFFORDABLE AS IT CAN BE YOU KNOW FREE EXCEPT FOR YOUR COST OF LIVING. AND I AND THERE ARE SO MANY WAYS FOR STUDENTS EVEN IF THEY DON'T MEET THIS QUANTITATIVE REASONING REQUIREMENT IF IT WAS IN PLACE. TO CONTINUE THROUGH WITH COMMUNITY COLLEGE WHICH IS PROBABLY THE SMARTEST EDUCATIONAL CHOICE ANY CALIFORNIAN CAN MAKE IS TO GO TO CATCH A COMMUNITY COLLEGE FOR THEIR FIRST TWO YEARS. AND DIED AND THAT DOESN'T CHANGE PARTICULARLY NOW IN LIGHT OF THE MOMENT THAT WERE IN. AND I SPEAK NOT JUST AS A POLICYMAKER BUT I SPEAK WITH SOMEONE WITH A GREAT DEAL OF EXPERIENCE. WITH ROAD BLOCKS TO GRADUATION. I AM A GRADUATE OF CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE. AND I NEEDED TO TAKE REMEDIAL MATH. WHEN I GOT TO CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE IT WASN'T A SURPRISE. I GRADUATED HIGH SCHOOL JUST FINE ON BUT- WHEN I TOOK ALGEBRA TWO MY TEACHER. WAS THE FOOTBALL COACH AND THE P. E. TEACHER. AND HE WAS A REALLY GOOD DRIVERS ED TEACHER I HAD AN FOR DRIVER SAID AS WELL. AND I IS THAT DRIVERS ED EXAM. NO MY KIDS MIGHT THINK I DIDN'T. BUT I DID NOT GET PREPARED FOR COLLEGE LEVEL MATH. SHOCKER AND THAT'S A STORY THAT I THINK A LOT OF STUDENTS HAVE. ANY EXPERIENCE I THINK THAT THIS YES YOU LISTEN TO L. L. U. S. T. I. I DIDN'T GO TO LAUSD SCHOOL- BUT- THAT STUDENTS AREN'T GETTING THE PREPARATION THEY NEED IN HIGH SCHOOL. AND SO NOW THE CSU IS DEALING WITH THAT CHALLENGE THEY DEALT WITH IT WHERE I HAD TO. TAKE REMEDIAL MATH ANY NUMBER OF TIMES BECAUSE I DID DROP OUT A FEW TIMES I ACTUALLY. DID NOT PASS IT THE FIRST TIME I TOOK IT I FINALLY TOOK COLLEGE LEVEL MATH THE FALL OF MY SENIOR YEAR I PUT IT OFF AND PUT IT OFF. I DID JUST FINE. I DID JUST FINDING BECAUSE OF HIM ACTUALLY ENJOYED THE CLASS BUT- BUT THIS YES YOU LISTEN TO THAT EXPERIENCE AND SAID THIS ISN'T HELPING OUR STUDENTS GRADUATE AND IN FACT WE CAN TEACH ALL OF THEM- AT AT A COLLEGE LEVEL WITHOUT MAKING AND TAKE WHAT ESSENTIALLY WAS A AN OBSTACLE COURSE FOR ME. I WHERE I HAD TO SPEND MONEY ON CLASSES THAT DID NOT GIVE ME COLLEGE CREDIT. AND SLOWED DOWN AND SLOW DOWN HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS PROBABLY OVER THE YEARS OF STUDENTS. FROM GRADUATING AND TIMELY MANNER. SO I BELIEVE THIS ISSUE IS DOING EVERYTHING THEY CAN. THE SERVICE POPULATION. WILL CALIFORNIA POPULATION BUT IF YOU JUST LOOK AT THE DATA A PARTICULARLY OF OUR- UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS IN CALIFORNIA THAT WE ARE DOING AMAZING IN GETTING MINORITY STUDENTS TO GRADUATE DEGREES THAT COME OUT OF THE CSU- SO. THEY'RE DOING THE THINGS THAT WE'RE ASKING OF THEM AND THEY'RE TRYING TO FIND WAYS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE WORK FOR. AND WE PEOPLE IN TIME AND IN FACT THEY'RE DOING AS WE HEARD ON THE CALL I DIDN'T EVEN MEET WITH THEM ABOUT THIS I JUST KNOW FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE AND WHAT I'VE READ THEY'RE DOING THE THINGS THAT WE'RE ASKING THEM TO DO IN THIS BILL. I DON'T MIND BELTS AND SUSPENDERS- FOR GROUPS THAT WE DON'T TRUST ON I KNOW THIS YEAR'S HE'S WORKING REALLY HARD ON THIS ISSUE AND- AND THAT'S WHY TODAY AND REALLY SADLY YOU KNOW I WRESTLED WITH THIS OVERNIGHT I LISTEN TO. THE TESTIMONY AND FOR SOME NOT ABLE TO SUPPORT IT BUT I DO APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION THAT WE'RE HAVING THE GOAL THAT WERE HAVING AND- OF MAKING SURE THAT THE DOORS TO HIGHER AT OUR OPEN EVERYONE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER LEVINE ASSEMBLY MEMBER WEBER. YES I WANT TO THANK. OUR CHAIR FOR THIS BILL AND I'M ONE OF THE CO OP IS ON THE BILL AND I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUE BECAUSE- IN MANY WAYS THEY ARE CORRECT TO THE EXTENT THAT THE UNIVERSITY HAS- LISTENED EVENTUALLY TO THE AUDIENCE TO THE PUBLIC AND DECIDED TO GO IN THAT DIRECTION AND THAT AND THAT'S IMPORTANT. I GUESS THE PROBLEM COMES IN IS THAT THE TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF ENERGY THAT WAS EXPENDED AND THE KIND OF ANXIETY CREATED AS A RESULT OF THEM NOT HAVING THE PROCESS AND NOT HAVING INCLUSION OF THE PUBLIC- COMMENTS AND RESEARCH IN ADVANCE RATHER THAN AFTER THE FACT YOU KNOW AFTER BEING PRESSURE AND THE KIND OF PUBLICITY AND ANXIETY THAT STUDENTS AND- AND STAFFERS HAD ABOUT THIS. WAS REALLY UNNECESSARY WITH THEIR IT ENGAGED IN THIS PROCESS OF THE BEGINNING AND BASICALLY SOUGHT OUT THE INFORMATION THAT WAS NECESSARY THEN WE WOULDN'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS WOULD HAVE HAD HEARINGS ON IT HERE AT THE CAPITOL WOULD HAVE GONE TO ALL THESE THINGS IN THE HEARING TO REALLY WILL BY WERE BOB PROCESS AND WHETHER THAT THE RIGHT QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN ASKED. AND SO FORTH AND SO ON AND SO THIS BILL IS REALLY ABOUT NOT NECESSARILY CONDEMNING THE WOULD MAKING SURE THAT IN THE FUTURE IF THERE ARE CHANGES AND SHIFTS AND REQUIREMENTS THERE'S A PROCESS IN PLACE THAT DIDN'T DOES THIS SO THE WE DON'T FIND OURSELVES ONCE AGAIN HAVING LISTENED TO IT ON THE NEWS FIGURE OUT WHO DID WHAT SO FORTH AND SO ON BUT BASICALLY ADDRESSED THE ISSUE AS IT SHOULD BE YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY CORRECT THE C. ISSUED TO THE UC'S ARE WRESTLING WITH. ISSUE OF ADMISSIONS AND QUALIFICATIONS AND THE PROBLEM LIES REALLY UNFORTUNATELY YEAH IF THE WITH ALL OF THEM BECAUSE I COULD SAY WELL TO KEEP TWELVE ISSUE BECAUSE L. L. A. U. S. V. COMES BACK AND SAYS WE CAN'T OFFER THESE CLASSES WE DON'T HAVE QUALIFIED STAFF. IF WE HAVE NOT STUDENTS FOR THE EDUCATED WHICH IS A FORTUNATE THAT THEY HAVE NOT DONE THAT- AND SO AS A RESULT NO YEAH IT'S OUR K. TWELVE BUT THE I BACK UP AND ALWAYS SAY TO EVERYBODY WHO TRAIN ALL THE TEACHERS IN CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW AND BASICALLY OVER 80% OF OUR TEACHERS ARE MORE TRADE. BAR SEE ISSUE AND USE STATE SO ARTS. OF A- THAT OCCUR. BY UNIV. ARE NOT ADDED. FOR OUR TEACHERS WERE TEACHING MAP. AND SO FORTH AND SO ON TO BASICALLY MEET THE CHALLENGE SO. WE START POINTING FINGERS AT ALL COMES BACK TO ALL OF THAT. AND THEN IT COMES BACK TO US BECAUSE WE HAVE NO ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM. AND HAVE NOT DEALT WITH A HEART ISSUES THE TEACHER CERTIFICATION. THE TEACHER REQUIREMENT TEACHER AT OF ASSESSMENT THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN AND THE EXPECTATIONS AND HOLDING OUR OWN K. TWELVE SYSTEM ACCOUNTABLE. SO EVERYONE IS REALLY AT FAULT AT THIS POINT AND THE LAST PERSON WHO SHOULD PAY FOR. OTHER STRUGGLING STUDENTS TO ATTENDING OUR SCHOOLS. PUTTING THEIR ENERGY INTO A THINKING THAT WE'RE GIVING THEM THE BEST THAT WE HAVE. AND WE'RE NOT AND SO AS A RESULT THEY SHOULD BE THE LAST ONES WHO BASICALLY SUPPER. AND FIND THEMSELVES IN A SITUATION OF HAVING TO GO TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE. COMMUNITY COLLEGE IS A GREAT THIS IS THE BILL. BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE SUCCESS RATE KIDS OF COLOR IN COMMUNITY COLLEGE. IT IS NOT THE GREATEST PLACE FOR THEM BECAUSE THE MOST OF THEM DON'T GRADUATE FROM A COMMUNITY COLLEGE- GIVE VERY FEW EIGHTY DEGREES WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT. MANY OF THEM DROP OUT COME BACK DROP OUT AND COME BACK BECAUSE OF THE STRUCTURE AND WHAT HAVE YOU. AND SO WE'RE TRYING TO IMPROVE OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE. BUT IT IS NOT THE FOR MANY STUDENTS GOING TO A FOUR YEAR INSTITUTION EVEN IF THEY STRUGGLE. BECAUSE EVERYONE THERE IS TRYING TO GET A DEGREE THE END OF WITH FORCES. AT THE FOUR YEAR. THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SO WE HAVE A LOT OF CHALLENGES THAT WE NEED TO MEET. BUT THE LAST PERSON WHO SHOULD BASICALLY PAY FOR OUR STUDENTS WILL PUT THEIR BEST INTO WHAT WE GAVE THEM. AND THEN FIND THEMSELVES SHORT. SO I'M BACK TO ASTRONOMICAL. TO THIS PARTICULAR BILL. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER WEBER. ARE THERE ANY OTHER. QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. THANK YOU AND MISTER CHAIR TO HAVE CLOSING STATEMENTS THANK YOU I THOUGHT I'D LIKE TO THANK BOTH OF MY COLLEAGUES WERE THERE- COMMENTS AND DISCUSSION ON THIS BILL. AND. TO THE- MY COLLEAGUES WHO STRUGGLE WITH HIGH SCHOOL MATH. I NEVER MADE IT TO THIRD YOUR MATH IN HIGH SCHOOL. BECAUSE I HAD SUCH A HARD TIME WITH WITH THE SECOND YEAR OF YOUR GEOMETRY. THE SECOND YEAR OF HIGH SCHOOL MATH. TO THE CHAGRIN OF MY FATHER THE CIVIL ENGINEER. BUT I IT WAS SUCCESSFUL IN COLLEGE- GOING TO PREVIEW UNIVERSITY WHERE I MAJORED FIRST AND POLITICAL SCIENCE AND THEN IN HISTORY WHEN I TRANSFERRED TO YOU SEE YOU ARE. AND I WANT TO THANK DOCTOR WEBER IN HER REMARKS BECAUSE I THINK THE NECESSARY CITY OF THIS BILL. IS THAT THE CSU DID NOT ENGAGE THE CSU DID NOT ENGAGE. EITHER WITH THE LEGISLATURE. AND TELL THEY REALLY HAD TO OR WITH THE K. TELL K. TWELVE SYSTEM WITH THE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION NOR WITH- K. TWELVE DISTRICTS THEMSELVES. SO THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL I THINK IT'S DOCTOR WEBER WELL POINTED OUT IS TO ENSURE THAT THE NEXT TIME. THE CSU- CONSIDERS CHANGING THE A THROUGH G. REQUIREMENTS IT WILL ENGAGE WITH THOSE WHO WILL HAVE TO- THERE- THE CHANGES AND THOSE ARE THE K. TWELVE AND- AND THE STUDENTS SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR FIVE OF. PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.
