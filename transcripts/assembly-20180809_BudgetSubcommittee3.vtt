WHILE WE DO THIS IF THIS IS.

00:12:59.578 --> 00:13:01.280
THE REALITY OF HOW IT'S GOING TO

00:13:01.347 --> 00:13:01.947
BE AND IT'S NOT GOING TO GET ANY

THE EXIDE BATTERY CLEAN UP IT'S

00:14:16.355 --> 00:14:17.189
CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT I

00:14:17.256 --> 00:14:18.357
WANTED TO JUMP IN THIS IS A

00:14:18.424 --> 00:14:19.925
COMMUNITY THAT I HAVE GROWN UP

IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT

00:14:27.366 --> 00:14:28.801
THINGS THAT WE NEED TO THINK

00:14:28.867 --> 00:14:30.135
ABOUT IT'S ONE OF THE WORST

00:14:30.202 --> 00:14:31.403
ENVIRONMENTAL DISASTERS AT THE

STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS SEEN.

00:14:32.871 --> 00:14:33.906
AND YET.

00:14:33.973 --> 00:14:36.442
THE VERY PEOPLE VERY FEW PEOPLE

00:14:36.508 --> 00:14:37.243
ACTUALLY KNOW ABOUT.

I WOULD LIKE TO THANK EVERYONE

00:14:38.577 --> 00:14:39.845
THAT MADE TONIGHT POSSIBLE

00:14:39.912 --> 00:14:41.180
INCLUDING RESURRECTION

00:14:41.247 --> 00:14:42.815
RESURRECTION CHURCH FOR OPENING

00:14:42.881 --> 00:14:45.217
ITS DOORS AND ALLOWING THIS FACE.

00:14:45.284 --> 00:14:46.352
AND THIS DIALOGUE TO ACTUALLY

00:14:46.418 --> 00:14:49.622
HAPPEN.

00:14:49.688 --> 00:14:51.257
OVER THE PAST SEVERAL DECADES

00:14:51.323 --> 00:14:53.025
EXIDE BATTERY RECYCLING FACILITY

00:14:53.092 --> 00:14:55.227
HAS EXPOSED FAMILIES AND

00:14:55.294 --> 00:14:57.496
RESIDENTS TO DANGEROUS LEVELS OF

00:14:57.563 --> 00:14:58.130
LEAD.

00:14:58.197 --> 00:14:58.764
WE KNOW THAT EVEN A SMALL

00:14:58.831 --> 00:15:01.233
PERCENTAGE SON OF LETTUCE

00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:03.569
DANGEROUS SO THE LEVELS THAT WE

00:15:03.636 --> 00:15:05.571
HAVE SEEN.

00:15:05.638 --> 00:15:06.739
THEIR HORRIFIC FOR THIS

00:15:06.805 --> 00:15:08.073
COMMUNITY IF YOU THINK ABOUT

00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:10.509
CHILDREN PREGNANT MOTHERS OR

00:15:10.576 --> 00:15:11.944
PREGNANT WOMEN X. SOON TO BE

00:15:12.011 --> 00:15:13.912
EXPECTING.

00:15:13.979 --> 00:15:14.480
AND WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING

00:15:14.546 --> 00:15:16.248
ABOUT THAT THE CENTER FOR

00:15:16.315 --> 00:15:17.850
DISEASE CONTROL PREVENTION

00:15:17.916 --> 00:15:20.653
IDENTIFIED LED TO BE THE POTENT.

00:15:20.719 --> 00:15:23.022
NEUROTOXIN WITH NO SAFE LEVEL OF

00:15:23.088 --> 00:15:24.456
EXPOSURE.

00:15:24.523 --> 00:15:26.392
THAT IS EXTREMELY HAZARDOUS

00:15:26.458 --> 00:15:28.894
SUBSTANCE KNOWS KNOWN TO CAUSE

00:15:28.961 --> 00:15:30.396
BRAIN DEVELOPMENT BECAUSE

00:15:30.462 --> 00:15:32.731
LEARNING PROBLEMS AND EVEN SLOW

00:15:32.798 --> 00:15:34.199
PHYSICAL GROWTH IN YOUNG

00:15:34.266 --> 00:15:35.000
CHILDREN.

00:15:35.067 --> 00:15:37.236
IT IS CRITICAL THAT WE CLEAN UP

00:15:37.303 --> 00:15:39.672
THIS HAZARDOUS THIS HAZARD AS

00:15:39.738 --> 00:15:41.140
QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.

00:15:41.206 --> 00:15:43.776
THE NEGLIGENCE THAT HAS BEEN.

00:15:43.842 --> 00:15:45.511
PREVAILING IN THIS COMMUNITY

00:15:45.577 --> 00:15:47.846
THAT HAS FOR QUITE TOO LONG BEEN

00:15:47.913 --> 00:15:49.515
DISENFRANCHISED.

00:15:49.581 --> 00:15:51.583
IS CRIMINAL AND SO WE NEED TO DO

00:15:51.650 --> 00:15:52.618
SOMETHING ABOUT IT AND NOW THAT

00:15:52.685 --> 00:15:54.453
WE ARE.

00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:56.121
NOW WE HAVE TO ASK THE QUESTION

00:15:56.188 --> 00:15:58.324
WHY IT'S TAKEN SO LONG.

00:15:58.390 --> 00:15:59.858
IN ADDITION TO WHAT'S ALREADY

00:15:59.925 --> 00:16:01.327
BEEN MENTIONED THE HOMES THE

00:16:01.393 --> 00:16:03.128
PARKWAYS THE GRASS THE SOIL THE

00:16:03.195 --> 00:16:05.164
SIDEWALKS HAVE ALSO LARGELY BEEN

00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:07.166
NEGLECTED.

00:16:07.232 --> 00:16:08.667
I WAS TOLD WHEN I FIRST.

00:16:08.734 --> 00:16:10.002
GOT INTO OFFICE AND STARTED

00:16:10.069 --> 00:16:11.503
ASKING QUESTIONS ABOUT EXCITED

00:16:11.570 --> 00:16:12.571
THAT EVERYTHING THAT COULD

00:16:12.638 --> 00:16:14.406
POSSIBLY BE DONE HAD ALREADY

00:16:14.473 --> 00:16:16.075
BEEN DONE.

00:16:16.141 --> 00:16:19.011
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT TO BE TRUE.

00:16:19.078 --> 00:16:20.879
SCRATCHED THE SURFACE OF WHAT IT

00:16:20.946 --> 00:16:22.915
TRULY MEANS TO LOOK AT THIS AS

00:16:22.981 --> 00:16:24.750
AN ENVIRONMENTAL --

00:16:24.817 --> 00:16:26.685
HARM TO THIS COMMUNITY AND WHAT

00:16:26.752 --> 00:16:27.820
WE CAN DO TO ENSURE THAT

00:16:27.886 --> 00:16:30.456
EVERYONE REGARDLESS OF LEVELS

00:16:30.522 --> 00:16:32.458
HAVE SAFETY AND DIGNITY AND

00:16:32.524 --> 00:16:34.193
PROSPEROUS HEALTHY LIVES IN THIS

00:16:34.259 --> 00:16:35.728
COMMUNITY.

00:16:35.794 --> 00:16:37.529
WE'RE NOT ONLY LOOKING AT EXIDE

00:16:37.596 --> 00:16:39.164
OVER LOOKING AT EVERYTHING ELSE

00:16:39.231 --> 00:16:41.233
THAT HAS IMPACTED THIS COMMUNITY

00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:42.701
COMMUNITY FOR FAR TOO LONG.

00:16:42.768 --> 00:16:46.004
THE UNFORTUNATE MINIMAL PROGRESS

00:16:46.071 --> 00:16:47.439
BY THE DEPARTMENT OF TALK TALK

00:16:47.506 --> 00:16:49.241
THAT SUBSTANTIAL.

00:16:49.308 --> 00:16:50.242
THAT HAS BEEN MADE WITH THIS

00:16:50.309 --> 00:16:52.211
CLEAN UP IS REALLY QUITE FRANKLY

00:16:52.277 --> 00:16:54.179
UNACCEPTABLE IF THIS COMMUNITY

00:16:54.246 --> 00:16:56.315
LOOKED ANY DIFFERENT.

00:16:56.382 --> 00:16:56.915
THAN THE COMMUNITY THAT LIVES

00:16:56.982 --> 00:16:58.016
HERE.

00:16:58.083 --> 00:16:59.952
I CAN ALMOST GUESS THAT THAT

00:17:00.018 --> 00:17:00.552
CLEAN UP WOULD HAVE BEEN DONE

00:17:00.619 --> 00:17:01.920
MUCH FASTER.

00:17:01.987 --> 00:17:03.222
AND THAT IS DEFINITELY SOMETHING

00:17:03.288 --> 00:17:04.890
TO CONSIDER.

00:17:04.957 --> 00:17:06.859
DISCOURSE IS IMPORTANT OVER THE

00:17:06.925 --> 00:17:08.026
BRIEF TIME THAT I'VE BEEN IN THE

00:17:08.093 --> 00:17:09.194
STATE ASSEMBLY HAD BEEN

00:17:09.261 --> 00:17:10.996
COMMITTED TO LISTENING.

00:17:11.063 --> 00:17:12.731
LEARNING ESPECIALLY ON THIS

00:17:12.798 --> 00:17:14.833
ISSUE I HAVE ALSO SPOKEN TO THE

00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:16.068
COMMUNITY MEMBERS.

00:17:16.135 --> 00:17:18.871
LEADING THE CHARGE OF THIS CLEAN

00:17:18.937 --> 00:17:19.471
UP AND I WANT TO THANK FATHER

00:17:19.538 --> 00:17:21.306
JOHN READ UP FOR LEADING THAT

00:17:21.373 --> 00:17:22.875
CHARGE HIM FOR OPENING UP SPACE

00:17:22.941 --> 00:17:24.343
BECAUSE THE MOST IMPORTANT THING

00:17:24.410 --> 00:17:26.178
THAT ELECTED OFFICIALS CAN DO.

00:17:26.245 --> 00:17:27.913
IS LISTEN TO THE CONSTITUENTS

00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:29.348
LISTEN TO THE PEOPLE THAT WE

00:17:29.415 --> 00:17:30.816
ACTUALLY REPRESENT.

00:17:30.883 --> 00:17:33.118
AND HOPEFULLY DO THE RIGHT THING

00:17:33.185 --> 00:17:35.020
AND DO IT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.

00:17:35.087 --> 00:17:35.654
SO THAT PEOPLE CAN LIVE HEALTHY

00:17:35.721 --> 00:17:37.456
LIVES.

00:17:37.523 --> 00:17:39.458
DR JILL JOHNSON IS ALSO A LEADER

00:17:39.525 --> 00:17:40.893
THAT I WANT TO RECOGNIZE SEEKING

00:17:40.959 --> 00:17:42.628
ANSWERS OF BEHALF OF THE

00:17:42.694 --> 00:17:44.029
COMMUNITY HER STUDIES.

00:17:44.096 --> 00:17:46.365
HAVE FOUND TO BE ALIGNED WITH

00:17:46.432 --> 00:17:50.402
THE HEALTH CONCERNS THAT EXIDE --

00:17:50.469 --> 00:17:52.304
HAS PREVAILED IN THIS COMMUNITY.

00:17:52.371 --> 00:17:54.039
I AM DETERMINED --

00:17:54.106 --> 00:17:54.640
WITH THE COORDINATION BETWEEN

00:17:54.706 --> 00:17:56.975
OUR COMMUNITIES STATE LEADERS

00:17:57.042 --> 00:17:58.911
THAT WE CAN ENSURE THAT FUNDS

00:17:58.977 --> 00:18:00.412
ARE BEING USED IN THE MOST

00:18:00.479 --> 00:18:03.015
EFFECTIVE WAYS TO MISS GARCIA'S

00:18:03.081 --> 00:18:04.516
POINT TODAY WE DID MEET WITH

00:18:04.583 --> 00:18:05.083
RIGHT WHETHER WHAT WITH THE

00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:06.552
PRESIDENT TODAY.

00:18:06.618 --> 00:18:08.086
WE ALSO MET WITH WORKERS.

00:18:08.153 --> 00:18:10.656
SOME OF WHOM HAVE STUDIED UNDER

00:18:10.722 --> 00:18:12.891
LABORERS LOCAL THREE HUNDRED

00:18:12.958 --> 00:18:14.026
SOME HAVE.

00:18:14.092 --> 00:18:15.494
JOIN THE UNION FOR THIS WORK

00:18:15.561 --> 00:18:17.229
SOME HAVE AND WE KNOW THAT THIS

00:18:17.296 --> 00:18:18.997
WORK IS BEING DONE TO A PROJECT

00:18:19.064 --> 00:18:19.631
LABOR AGREEMENT AND I WANT TO

00:18:19.698 --> 00:18:20.532
MAKE SURE.

00:18:20.599 --> 00:18:21.834
THAT MOVING FORWARD THESE

00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:23.068
WORKERS.

00:18:23.135 --> 00:18:25.337
ARE ACTUALLY USING THE SAFETY

00:18:25.404 --> 00:18:27.039
STANDARDS THAT ARE NECESSARY TO

00:18:27.105 --> 00:18:28.874
DO THIS WORK IT'S CONCERNING TO

00:18:28.941 --> 00:18:29.842
ME.

00:18:29.908 --> 00:18:32.044
THAT A PROJECT THAT HAS HIGH

00:18:32.110 --> 00:18:33.545
LEVELS OF LEAD.

00:18:33.612 --> 00:18:35.314
IS BEING DONE.

00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:37.683
WITHOUT THE PROTECTION NECESSARY

00:18:37.749 --> 00:18:39.485
TO ENSURE THAT THE PEOPLE DOING

00:18:39.551 --> 00:18:40.552
THIS WORK.

00:18:40.619 --> 00:18:42.120
ARE PROTECTED AGAINST ANY

00:18:42.187 --> 00:18:43.322
ADDITIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL HARMS

00:18:43.388 --> 00:18:45.257
TO THEMSELVES.

00:18:45.324 --> 00:18:46.992
SO I'D BE VERY INTERESTED IN IN

00:18:47.059 --> 00:18:48.393
LEARNING ABOUT THAT PROCESS AND

00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:50.028
LEARNING TO ENSURE THAT THE THE

00:18:50.095 --> 00:18:51.663
WORKERS WHO ARE DOING THIS CLEAN

00:18:51.730 --> 00:18:53.465
UP.

00:18:53.532 --> 00:18:55.968
ARE ALSO OF FOLLOWING THE SAFETY

00:18:56.034 --> 00:18:57.536
STANDARDS THAT THEY NEED SO THAT

00:18:57.603 --> 00:18:58.904
FIVE YEARS FROM NOW.

00:18:58.971 --> 00:19:00.005
WE'RE NOT LOOKING AT CANCER

00:19:00.072 --> 00:19:01.139
LEVEL RATES.

00:19:01.206 --> 00:19:02.741
ARE BASED ON THE PEOPLE THAT DID

PARK WHICH IS THERE ARE SEVERAL

00:45:52.749 --> 00:45:54.451
THINGS THAT THE TSC NEEDS TO

00:45:54.518 --> 00:45:56.253
CONSIDER --

00:45:56.320 --> 00:45:57.454
WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THIS

ACTUALLY WORK CLOSER TO ST SO

00:46:17.574 --> 00:46:18.909
THEY'LL BE IN THE ROADWAYS.

00:46:18.976 --> 00:46:20.611

PARKWAY IN SOME CASES IS SOLE

00:46:47.538 --> 00:46:49.973

01:05:58.321 --> 01:05:59.722
STATEMENT AND IF WE ARE LOOKING

01:05:59.789 --> 01:06:01.457
AT THAT WHY ARE WE WHY ARE WE

01:06:01.524 --> 01:06:03.292
COMFORTABLE WITH THE A LEVEL

01:06:03.359 --> 01:06:05.661
THAT THE STATE IS NOT

01:06:05.728 --> 01:06:06.295
COMFORTABLE IN GENERAL ANYWHERE

01:06:06.362 --> 01:06:07.430

GARCIA WE HAVE NOT CHANGED OUR

01:06:13.769 --> 01:06:15.237
CLEANUP.

01:06:15.304 --> 01:06:16.906
STANDARDS --

01:06:16.972 --> 01:06:18.074
EIGHTY PARTS PER MILLION IS A

01:06:18.140 --> 01:06:18.908
SCREENING LEVEL THAT WAS

01:06:18.974 --> 01:06:20.409
ESTABLISHED FOR THE OUT BY THE

01:06:20.476 --> 01:06:21.310
OFFICE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH

01:06:21.377 --> 01:06:24.213
HAZARD ASSESSMENT DTS USES THAT.

01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:26.649
AT THIS SITE AND AT OTHER SITES

01:06:26.716 --> 01:06:28.117
AS WELL --

01:06:28.184 --> 01:06:30.553
DDS HE WAS APPROPRIATED.

01:06:30.619 --> 01:06:34.390
MONEY TO CLEAN UP THE MOST --

01:06:34.457 --> 01:06:35.858
IMPACTED PROPERTIES THE

01:06:35.925 --> 01:06:37.226
PROPERTIES THAT HAVE THE HIGHEST

01:06:37.293 --> 01:06:39.128
LEVELS OF LEAD AND THE GREATEST

01:06:39.195 --> 01:06:40.529
EXPOSURE TO SENSITIVE

01:06:40.596 --> 01:06:42.465
INDIVIDUALS --

01:06:42.531 --> 01:06:44.467
WE RECEIVED ENOUGH FUNDING TO

01:06:44.533 --> 01:06:47.837
CLEAN UP APPROXIMATELY TWENTY

01:06:47.903 --> 01:06:48.637
FIVE HUNDRED PROPERTIES.

01:06:48.704 --> 01:06:50.906
THAT'S NOT ALL OF THE PROPERTIES%

01:06:50.973 --> 01:06:53.242
THAT ARE THAT ARE TESTING SHOWS

01:06:53.309 --> 01:06:56.345
HAVE ELEVATED LEVELS OF LEAD.

01:06:56.412 --> 01:06:58.080
WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO STRETCH

01:06:58.147 --> 01:07:00.082
THAT FUNDING TO ENSURE THAT WE

01:07:00.149 --> 01:07:01.183
ARE CLEANING UP ALL OF THE

01:07:01.250 --> 01:07:02.952
PROPERTIES THAT HAVE FOUR

01:07:03.018 --> 01:07:04.620
HUNDRED PARTS PER MILLION OR

01:07:04.687 --> 01:07:04.820
LESS.

01:07:04.887 --> 01:07:06.055
OF LEAD OR HIGHER --

01:07:06.122 --> 01:07:08.858
AS WELL AS THE HOT SPOTS THAT

01:07:08.924 --> 01:07:09.825
THE COMMUNITIES WERE WORRIED

01:07:09.892 --> 01:07:13.396
ABOUT WHERE EVEN THOUGH THE OF

01:07:13.462 --> 01:07:15.231
THE THE REPRESENTATIVE LEAD

01:07:15.297 --> 01:07:17.967
LEVEL OF THE PROPERTY WAS.

01:07:18.033 --> 01:07:18.801
FOUR HUNDRED THERE MIGHT HAVE OR

01:07:18.868 --> 01:07:21.137
BELOW FOUR HUNDRED THERE MY A

01:07:21.203 --> 01:07:24.273
SINGLE SAMPLE THAT WAS ABOVE A

01:07:24.340 --> 01:07:25.374
THOUSAND AND WE ARE CLEANING UP

01:07:25.441 --> 01:07:27.109
ALL OF THOSE AS WELL.

01:07:27.176 --> 01:07:28.244
SO WE HAVEN'T CHANGED THE

01:07:28.310 --> 01:07:32.348
ULTIMATE GOAL BUT WE HAVE INDEED --

01:07:32.415 --> 01:07:34.550
BEEN ABLE TO CLEAN UP TO FOUR

01:07:34.617 --> 01:07:35.518
HUNDRED WITH THE THE FUNDING WE

01:07:35.584 --> 01:07:37.686
HAVE NOW THAT I WANT TO BE SURE

01:07:37.753 --> 01:07:39.221
YOU UNDERSTAND ALSO.

01:07:39.288 --> 01:07:41.157
THAT WHEN WE CLEAN THE PROPERTY

01:07:41.223 --> 01:07:43.192
UP WE IDENTIFY THE PROPERTY

01:07:43.259 --> 01:07:44.560
THAT'S ABOVE FOUR HUNDRED BUT

01:07:44.627 --> 01:07:46.395
WHEN WE CLEAN IT UP WE CLEAN IT

01:07:46.462 --> 01:07:48.164
UP.

01:07:48.230 --> 01:07:48.764
TO EIGHTY THANK YOU FOR THAT

01:07:48.831 --> 01:07:49.598
CLARIFICATION.

01:07:49.665 --> 01:07:50.699
AND THAT LEADS ME TO MY SECOND

01:07:50.766 --> 01:07:52.268
QUESTION WE ALL KNOW WE NEED

01:07:52.334 --> 01:07:53.736
MORE THAN A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY

01:07:53.803 --> 01:07:54.970
SIX MILLION DOLLARS THAT HAS

01:07:55.037 --> 01:07:55.738
BEEN CLEAR FROM THE VERY

01:07:55.805 --> 01:07:56.705
BEGINNING.

01:07:56.772 --> 01:07:57.740
THE ESTIMATES HAVE BEEN ANYWHERE

01:07:57.807 --> 01:08:00.476
FROM HALF A BILLION TO UPWARDS

01:08:00.543 --> 01:08:01.710
OF A BILLION DOLLARS.

01:08:01.777 --> 01:08:02.778
TO JUST FOR THE CLEAN UP THAT

01:08:02.845 --> 01:08:03.546
DOESN'T INCLUDE THE HEALTH

01:08:03.612 --> 01:08:05.448
IMPACTS AND OTHER NEAT THAT WE

01:08:05.514 --> 01:08:06.849
HAVE ASSOCIATED WITH.

01:08:06.916 --> 01:08:10.519
CONTAMINATION WE WE PASSED AB

01:08:10.586 --> 01:08:11.454
TWENTY ONE FIFTY THREE WITH THAT

01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:12.054
WHICH IS A LETTER BATTERY FEE

01:08:12.121 --> 01:08:13.856
BILL STARTING TO COLLECT FUNDS

01:08:13.923 --> 01:08:16.025
IN THAT CITY WHY ARE WE TAKING

01:08:16.091 --> 01:08:17.159
THAT MONEY AND USING IT TO PAY

01:08:17.226 --> 01:08:18.727
BACK A LOAN INSTEAD OF MAKING

01:08:18.794 --> 01:08:19.762
SURE WE HAVE IT THERE TO WE

01:08:19.829 --> 01:08:20.629
COULD CLEAN.

01:08:20.696 --> 01:08:22.531
UP THE OTHER HOMES AND FOLLOW

01:08:22.598 --> 01:08:23.532
THROUGH WITH THE PROMISE THAT

01:08:23.599 --> 01:08:26.502
WE'RE NOT GOING TO LEAVE ANYONE

01:08:26.569 --> 01:08:28.170
BEHIND.

01:08:28.237 --> 01:08:32.308
THIS MAY BE A IT IT IT THIS WEEK

01:08:32.374 --> 01:08:32.975
TO WAIT ON THOSE ONE HUNDRED AND

01:08:33.042 --> 01:08:33.742
SEVENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS AND

01:08:33.809 --> 01:08:34.610
WE KNOW.

01:08:34.677 --> 01:08:36.479
HOW MUCH WE'RE GOING TO NEED AND

01:08:36.545 --> 01:08:37.813
AND AT THE RATE AT WHICH THAT

01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:39.482
BATTERY BILL IS?

01:08:39.548 --> 01:08:41.317
IS COLLECTING FINE I I HOPEFULLY

01:08:41.383 --> 01:08:43.252
IN FLORIDA WE ARE COMMITTED TO

01:08:43.319 --> 01:08:44.987
LEAVING THAT MONEY THERE FOUR TO

01:08:45.054 --> 01:08:45.921
TEN THE PURPOSE AND WE DO NOT

01:08:45.988 --> 01:08:46.989
USE IT TO PAY BACK THE LOAN

01:08:47.056 --> 01:08:48.724
UNTIL AFTER WE HAVE CLEANED UP

01:08:48.791 --> 01:08:49.792
ALL THESE FILMS AND WE HAVE A

01:08:49.859 --> 01:08:50.926
LET.

01:08:50.993 --> 01:08:55.264
ANYONE BEHIND --

01:08:55.331 --> 01:08:56.799
INCREASE THAT FEE BECAUSE AT THE

01:08:56.866 --> 01:08:57.633
RATE AT WHICH WERE COLLECTING

01:08:57.700 --> 01:08:59.068
WE'RE GOING TO NEED A LOT A LOT

01:08:59.134 --> 01:09:00.503
MORE HOW.

01:09:00.569 --> 01:09:02.204
IT'S FRUSTRATING. TO TO COME

01:09:02.271 --> 01:09:03.772
HOME BECAUSE THESE ARE MY

01:09:03.839 --> 01:09:04.907
NEIGHBORS.

01:09:04.974 --> 01:09:06.442
ODD TO SEE THE DESPAIR IN THEIR

01:09:06.509 --> 01:09:08.511
FACE WHEN THEY KNOW THEY HAVE

01:09:08.577 --> 01:09:11.113
NOW BEEN ENGAGED AND EDUCATED OF

01:09:11.180 --> 01:09:13.082
THE LEVEL OF TOXICITY AND WHAT

01:09:13.148 --> 01:09:14.783
THAT MEANS AND THOSE FORCES.

01:09:14.850 --> 01:09:16.685
AND THEY FEEL HELPLESS TO DO

01:09:16.752 --> 01:09:17.920
ANYTHING ABOUT IT AND THEY KNOW

01:09:17.987 --> 01:09:19.054
WHAT THEIR KIDS OR GRANDKIDS AND

01:09:19.121 --> 01:09:19.855
OURSELVES.

01:09:19.922 --> 01:09:21.423
ARE LIVING IN A CONTINUAL

01:09:21.490 --> 01:09:23.559
EXPOSURE AT MAKING THEM SICK AND

01:09:23.626 --> 01:09:24.593
THERE THAT I'M EXCITED WHAT'S

01:09:24.660 --> 01:09:26.395
COMING DOWN THE ROAD WHETHER

01:09:26.462 --> 01:09:27.530
IT'S CANCER WHAT IS THE LAST

01:09:27.596 --> 01:09:28.430
TIME A BATH MUCH.

01:09:28.497 --> 01:09:30.232
INDEED CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT

01:09:30.299 --> 01:09:31.634
IT AND YOU'RE BEING TOLD YOU

01:09:31.700 --> 01:09:33.469
KNOW WHAT JUST CLOSE YOUR DOORS

01:09:33.536 --> 01:09:34.370
AND CLOSER WHEN THOSE WHO WERE

01:09:34.436 --> 01:09:35.437
JUST OUTSIDE RIGHT NOW.

01:09:35.504 --> 01:09:36.872
AND THIS IS NOT AN EXCEPTIONAL

01:09:36.939 --> 01:09:38.707
DAY OF HOW WARM IT IS THAT'S NOT

01:09:38.774 --> 01:09:40.409
UNLIKE THAT OF PRAGMATIC

01:09:40.476 --> 01:09:41.710
SOLUTION.

01:09:41.777 --> 01:09:42.811
ON AND BOOKS ARE GONNA BE

01:09:42.878 --> 01:09:44.480
WAITING AT THE RATE WE'RE GOING

01:09:44.547 --> 01:09:46.282
TWO YEARS FOUR YEARS FIVE YEARS

01:09:46.348 --> 01:09:47.216
TEN YEARS FOR CLEAN UP.

01:09:47.283 --> 01:09:48.317
I THINK WE HAVE TO START

01:09:48.384 --> 01:09:50.386
THINKING ABOUT THAT KID THAT WAS

01:09:50.452 --> 01:09:51.987
BORN INTO THIS CONTAMINATION.

01:09:52.054 --> 01:09:53.489
AT FOUR HUNDRED PARTS PER

01:09:53.556 --> 01:09:55.691
MILLION OR TWO HUNDRED PARTS PER

01:09:55.758 --> 01:09:57.192
MILLION AND WHAT WE KNOW IT DOES.

01:09:57.259 --> 01:09:57.960
AND THE FACT THAT THEY'RE GONNA

01:09:58.027 --> 01:09:59.461
HAVE TO WAIT TEN YEARS FOR THE

01:09:59.528 --> 01:10:00.429
CLEANUP AND WHAT HAVE YOU DONE

01:10:00.496 --> 01:10:02.131
TO THEIR DEVELOPMENT AND WHAT

01:10:02.197 --> 01:10:03.332
WE'RE GOING TO BE PAYING FOR

01:10:03.399 --> 01:10:05.167
LIKE A LEADER AS TAXPAYERS.

01:10:05.234 --> 01:10:09.004
DON'T WE OWE THAT KID BETTER.

01:10:09.071 --> 01:10:10.439
THEY ARE NOT.

01:10:10.506 --> 01:10:13.909
AND SO I WE ARE THINKING OF

01:10:13.976 --> 01:10:15.678
CLEAN UP BUT WE'RE ALSO THINKING

01:10:15.744 --> 01:10:16.579
OF OTHER CREATIVE WAYS AND WE

01:10:16.645 --> 01:10:18.147
START THINKING ABOUT POSSIBLY WE

01:10:18.213 --> 01:10:20.015
NEED TO HELP THESE INDIVIDUALS.

01:10:20.082 --> 01:10:21.684
FIND AFFORDABLE HOUSING MAYBE

01:10:21.750 --> 01:10:23.085
HELP TO FUNDING FOR THAT I MEAN

01:10:23.152 --> 01:10:24.653
I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE DO BUT WE

01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:26.221
HAVE TO START THINKING BEYOND

01:10:26.288 --> 01:10:27.856
JUST CLOSE YOUR DOORS AND CLOSE

01:10:27.923 --> 01:10:29.792
YOUR WINDOWS AND WAIT FOR FIVE

01:10:29.858 --> 01:10:30.926
TO TEN YEARS.

01:10:30.993 --> 01:10:32.294
UP TO DO THIS.

01:10:32.361 --> 01:10:34.530
AND SO IF THIS IS THE BEST WE

01:10:34.597 --> 01:10:35.965
COULD DO AND IS AS FAST AS WE

01:10:36.031 --> 01:10:39.068
COULD CLEAN UP I CAN'T KEEP

01:10:39.134 --> 01:10:39.668
COMING HOME AND TELLING PEOPLE

01:10:39.735 --> 01:10:40.502
TO SWAY.

01:10:40.569 --> 01:10:41.503
WE HAVE TO START THINKING OF

01:10:41.570 --> 01:10:43.472
OTHER WAYS TO DO THIS AND IF

01:10:43.539 --> 01:10:46.342
IT'S OUR LAWS AND REGULATIONS

01:10:46.408 --> 01:10:46.909
THAT ARE UPON THAT ONLY THIS

01:10:46.976 --> 01:10:47.676

WE HAVE ENOUGH TALENT

01:10:48.243 --> 01:10:49.712
COLLECTIVELY TO FIGURE OUT HOW

01:10:49.778 --> 01:10:50.346
TO BRING SOME OF THESE DOWN AT

01:10:50.412 --> 01:10:51.313
THEM AND THEN DOWN IN THESE

01:10:51.380 --> 01:10:55.918
EXTRAORDINARY CRISIS MOMENTS.

01:10:55.985 --> 01:10:57.252

EXPECT TO BE CLEANED UP BY THE

01:11:31.153 --> 01:11:32.354
END OF THIS YEAR AND WE'VE HAD

01:11:32.421 --> 01:11:33.522
SOME HEATED DEBATES.

01:11:59.882 --> 01:12:01.083
TO CHANGE OUT LOUD TO MAKE THAT

01:12:01.150 --> 01:12:02.718
EXPLAINS THE GO AWAY SO THAT WE

01:12:02.785 --> 01:12:03.686
CAN.

01:12:03.752 --> 01:12:05.554
HAVE SOME SUBSTANTIVE CHANGES

01:12:05.621 --> 01:12:07.322
BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR --

01:12:07.389 --> 01:12:09.425
WHAT IS THAT NUMBER AND WHAT

01:12:09.491 --> 01:12:11.260
DOES IT LOOK LIKE IN THE RAMP

01:12:11.326 --> 01:12:12.795
FACE WENT?

01:12:12.861 --> 01:12:15.264
MOSTLY NEWS TOUCHED ON THAT A

01:12:15.330 --> 01:12:17.166
LITTLE AND THANK YOU THAT'S A

01:12:17.232 --> 01:12:18.500
GOOD QUESTION --

01:12:18.567 --> 01:12:20.102
ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND AND I THINK

01:12:20.169 --> 01:12:22.171
IN MY PRESENTATION I DID MENTION

01:12:22.237 --> 01:12:22.838
THAT.

01:12:22.905 --> 01:12:24.740
AS OF THIS WEEK WE HAVE THIRTEEN

01:12:24.807 --> 01:12:26.508
CRUISE OUT IN THE FIELD AND

01:12:26.575 --> 01:12:29.011
THERE SCHEDULING TWELVE TO

01:12:29.078 --> 01:12:30.479
FIFTEEN PROPERTIES PER WEEK.

01:12:30.546 --> 01:12:31.847
SO IF YOU JUST COUNT HOW MANY

01:12:31.914 --> 01:12:34.116
WEEKS ARE LEFT TO THE END OF THE

01:12:34.183 --> 01:12:35.451
YEAR WE CAN WE CAN.

01:12:35.517 --> 01:12:37.486
ESTABLISH A ROUGH NUMBER ON HOW

01:12:37.553 --> 01:12:38.954
MANY PROPERTIES WILL BE CLEANING

01:12:39.021 --> 01:12:40.022
BUT ONCE WE GET.

01:12:40.089 --> 01:12:42.324
ONCE YOU KNOW ONCE WE GET TO THE

01:12:42.391 --> 01:12:44.059
NEXT CONTRACT WE ARE PLANNING TO

01:12:44.126 --> 01:12:45.861
WRAP THIS UP EVEN FURTHER AND GO

01:12:45.928 --> 01:12:47.429
UP TO AS MANY AS TWENTY FIVE

01:12:47.496 --> 01:12:48.630
PROPERTIES PER WEEK.

01:12:48.697 --> 01:12:50.165
SO I CAN'T GIVE YOU AN EXACT

01:12:50.232 --> 01:12:51.700
NUMBER BUT I THINK YOU CAN GET A

01:12:51.767 --> 01:12:54.636
SENSE THAT SOMEWHERE BETWEEN

01:12:54.703 --> 01:12:55.270
FIFTEEN TO TWENTY TO TWENTY FIVE

01:12:55.337 --> 01:12:57.339
PROPERTIES THAT WE ARE OUR

01:12:57.406 --> 01:13:00.209
TARGET TO CLEAN UP TO THE END

01:13:00.275 --> 01:13:00.843
THAT'S WHAT WE ARE ESTABLISHING

01:13:00.909 --> 01:13:01.777
HERE.

01:13:01.844 --> 01:13:04.847
AS OUR COMMITMENT AND AS ORACLE.

01:13:04.913 --> 01:13:07.683
AND IF I COULD JUST ADD TO THAT --

01:13:07.750 --> 01:13:10.152
IN TERMS OF WHAT LIMITS THE RATE

01:13:10.219 --> 01:13:12.421
THE THE THERE ARE TWO THINGS

01:13:12.488 --> 01:13:13.922
THAT AFFECT THE RAMP UP.

01:13:13.989 --> 01:13:16.358
THE FIRST IS WE WANT TO EXPAND

01:13:16.425 --> 01:13:17.459
THE RATE.

01:13:17.526 --> 01:13:20.462
ONLY AS FAST AS WE CAN SAFELY.

01:13:20.529 --> 01:13:22.731
INSURE THAT ALL THE LOGISTICS

01:13:22.798 --> 01:13:24.466
ARE DONE PROPERLY THE CLEANUP IS

01:13:24.533 --> 01:13:27.035
DONE PROPERLY IF YOU IF WE HAD

01:13:27.102 --> 01:13:28.203
EVERYBODY OUT GOING.

01:13:28.270 --> 01:13:29.972
FULL BORE RIGHT AWAY THERE WOULD

01:13:30.038 --> 01:13:31.039
BE A GREATER.

01:13:31.106 --> 01:13:32.808
CHANCE THAT THINGS WOULD NOT GO

01:13:32.875 --> 01:13:34.810
WELL AT A GIVEN PROPERTY WE WANT

01:13:34.877 --> 01:13:36.245
TO MAKE SURE IT'S DONE RIGHT.

01:13:36.311 --> 01:13:38.313
AND SO WE'RE GRADUALLY

01:13:38.380 --> 01:13:39.982
INCREASING THE RATE TO MAKE SURE

01:13:40.048 --> 01:13:41.250
IT'S DONE RIGHT.

01:13:41.316 --> 01:13:42.718
THE SECOND THING THAT AFFECTS IT

01:13:42.785 --> 01:13:46.054
IS HOW MANY ACCESS AGREEMENTS WE

01:13:46.121 --> 01:13:48.957
ARE ABLE TO SECURE YOUHEARD --

01:13:49.024 --> 01:13:52.661
AT MISTER SATAN IS AND HUNDRED

01:13:52.728 --> 01:13:53.862
PROPERTIES READY TO BE.

01:13:53.929 --> 01:13:56.231
CLEANED UP WE NEED TO HAVE MORE

01:13:56.298 --> 01:13:57.833
PROPERTIES WITH ACCESS

01:13:57.900 --> 01:13:59.768
AGREEMENTS IN PLACE WITH THE

01:13:59.835 --> 01:14:02.504
LANDSCAPING SELECTED SO --

01:14:02.571 --> 01:14:04.039
WHAT THE COMMUNITY WHAT THE

01:14:04.106 --> 01:14:05.774
COMMUNITY CAN DO IS IF YOU'RE

01:14:05.841 --> 01:14:06.809
INTERESTED IN HAVING YOUR

01:14:06.875 --> 01:14:07.910
PROPERTY CLEANED UP AND YOU'VE

01:14:07.976 --> 01:14:09.344
BEEN NOTIFIED THAT YOU'RE PART

01:14:09.411 --> 01:14:10.646
OF THIS --

01:14:10.712 --> 01:14:12.247
PHASE OF THE CLEAN UP PLEASE

01:14:12.314 --> 01:14:14.183
WORK WITH US TO QUICKLY GET

01:14:14.249 --> 01:14:16.118
ACCESS AGREEMENTS IN PLACE

01:14:16.185 --> 01:14:17.653
BECAUSE THAT'S SOMETHING THAT.

01:14:17.719 --> 01:14:19.721
THAT WE NEED TO HAVE IN PLACE IN

01:14:19.788 --> 01:14:21.690
ORDER TO MOVE MORE QUICKLY HAVE

01:14:21.757 --> 01:14:22.157
BEEN DOING SOME ROUGH

01:14:22.224 --> 01:14:23.992
CALCULATIONS IN MY HEAD AND MY

01:14:24.059 --> 01:14:25.994
SENSE IS THAT THE ANSWER TO YOU

01:14:26.061 --> 01:14:27.863
IS WE SHOULD BE DONE WITH THAT

01:14:27.930 --> 01:14:28.730
TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN THAT WE

01:14:28.797 --> 01:14:31.066
STARTED IN MAY BUY SOMETIME IN

01:14:31.133 --> 01:14:31.300
OCTOBER.

01:14:31.366 --> 01:14:32.367
THAT WAS THE GOALS I REQUIRE SO

01:14:32.434 --> 01:14:33.769
THAT'S THAT TRUNKS WE WERE

01:14:33.836 --> 01:14:35.704
TRYING TO DO BEFORE WE GOT THE

01:14:35.771 --> 01:14:37.139
LARGER CONTRACT IN THE PLACE.

01:14:37.206 --> 01:14:39.474
IN THE GOAL I THINK AS I RECALL

01:14:39.541 --> 01:14:40.943
FROM THE BRIEFING DOCUMENTS WAS

01:14:41.009 --> 01:14:41.977
TO HAVE.

01:14:42.044 --> 01:14:43.612
THE TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED THAT

01:14:43.679 --> 01:14:45.113
FIRST SET THE ONES THAT WERE

01:14:45.180 --> 01:14:46.715
PAYING FOR WITH A HUNDRED AND

01:14:46.782 --> 01:14:47.950
SEVENTY SIX POINT SIX MILLION

01:14:48.016 --> 01:14:48.150
DONE.

01:14:48.217 --> 01:14:50.052
WITHIN TWO YEARS BECAUSE THIS

01:14:50.118 --> 01:14:51.453
AFTER I RECALL THAT CORRECT SO

01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:52.187
THAT'S THE ANSWER TO YOUR

01:14:52.254 --> 01:14:54.890
QUESTION WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TWO

01:14:54.957 --> 01:14:55.490
HUNDRED FIFTEEN ADDITIONAL ONE

01:14:55.557 --> 01:14:57.059
FROM MAY TO OCTOBER.

01:14:57.125 --> 01:14:58.327
AND THEN WE HOPE TO HAVE THIS

01:14:58.393 --> 01:14:59.928
FIRST GROUP THAT'S PAYING FOR BY

01:14:59.995 --> 01:15:01.296
THE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX

01:15:01.363 --> 01:15:04.566
POINT SIX MILLION --

01:15:04.633 --> 01:15:06.735
DONE WITHIN TWO YEARS.

01:15:06.802 --> 01:15:07.603
SO I'M READING THIS RIGHT

01:15:07.669 --> 01:15:09.471
THERE'S ABOUT A HUNDRED AND

01:15:09.538 --> 01:15:10.072
FIFTEEN THAT WOULD GET DONE BY

01:15:10.138 --> 01:15:11.640
OCTOBER.

01:15:11.707 --> 01:15:12.274
NO NO WE WE SHOULD BE HAVING

01:15:12.341 --> 01:15:12.708
THAT.

01:15:12.774 --> 01:15:14.009
SINCE WE STARTED IN MAY WE

01:15:14.076 --> 01:15:16.378
SHOULD HAVE DONE TWO HUNDRED AND

01:15:16.445 --> 01:15:17.679
FIFTEEN OR SO BY OCTOBER SET TO

01:15:17.746 --> 01:15:19.081
HIKE OVER FIFTEEN WEEK WE RAMP

01:15:19.147 --> 01:15:21.183
IT UP FROM FIVE PROPERTIES A

01:15:21.250 --> 01:15:23.752
WEEK UP TO NOW 212-215-

01:15:23.819 --> 01:15:25.854
PROPERTIES PER WEEK BUT WE WE

01:15:25.921 --> 01:15:28.523
ARE UP PROBABLY OVER EIGHTY

01:15:28.590 --> 01:15:31.226
PROPERTIES OF THE TWO HUNDRED

01:15:31.293 --> 01:15:31.560
FIFTEEN THAT.

01:15:31.627 --> 01:15:33.395
WE WERE PLANNING TO CLEAN UP AND

01:15:33.462 --> 01:15:37.432
SO WE HAVE CLEAN UP MY ACT OVER

01:15:37.499 --> 01:15:38.467
AND AFTER DAD WE'RE GOING TO

01:15:38.533 --> 01:15:40.002

01:15:44.606 --> 01:15:45.140
TWENTY TO TWENTY FIVE PER WEEK

01:15:45.207 --> 01:15:48.076
SO THAT WILL GIVE US ANOTHER --

01:15:48.143 --> 01:15:49.778
NOVEMBER DECEMBER YOUNG MINDS

01:15:49.845 --> 01:15:51.747
AND AND THAT WAS MY QUESTION IF

01:15:51.813 --> 01:15:53.515
IT'S ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND

01:15:53.582 --> 01:15:54.349
FIFTEEN TO OCTOBER THE ESTIMATED

01:15:54.416 --> 01:15:55.150
AMOUNT.

AND THE POSSIBLE RAMP UP FACE

01:15:58.520 --> 01:16:00.555
GOES. TO TWENTY FIVE FOR WEEK.

01:16:00.622 --> 01:16:02.024
AT WHEN YOU DO THE MATH ALINA

01:16:02.090 --> 01:16:03.859
LIST MY UNLESS I MISSED

01:16:03.926 --> 01:16:04.426
SOMETHING HERE WE COULD BE

01:16:04.493 --> 01:16:06.428
LOOKING AT POTENTIALLY HOLDING

01:16:06.495 --> 01:16:10.799

IN THE YEAR.

01:16:12.234 --> 01:16:13.468
POTENTIALLY YES BUT IT WILL TAKE

01:16:13.535 --> 01:16:15.704
AWHILE TO RAMP UP TO TWENTY FIVE

01:16:15.771 --> 01:16:16.405
WE WON'T START THAT

01:16:16.471 --> 01:16:17.739
INSTANTANEOUSLY WITH THE NEW

01:16:17.806 --> 01:16:21.476
CONTRACT [inaudible]

01:16:21.543 --> 01:16:24.746

01:16:24.813 --> 01:16:26.515
SO.

01:16:26.581 --> 01:16:27.816
LIKE WHAT I REALLY ENJOY ABOUT

01:16:27.883 --> 01:16:29.184
THIS HEARING IS THAT WE'RE ALL

01:16:29.251 --> 01:16:30.285
COMING FROM VARIOUS DIFFERENT

01:16:30.352 --> 01:16:31.620
PERSPECTIVES --

01:16:31.687 --> 01:16:33.322
HE'S LOS ANGELES IS A COMMUNITY

01:16:33.388 --> 01:16:35.457
THAT IS 20% BELOW THE NATIONAL

01:16:35.524 --> 01:16:37.092
POVERTY LINE I'M SURE.

01:16:37.159 --> 01:16:39.161
SOMEONE OR SOME GOGGLES AND

01:16:39.227 --> 01:16:40.629
ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA AND SHARE

01:16:40.696 --> 01:16:43.231
VERY SIMILAR STATISTICS.

01:16:43.298 --> 01:16:45.467
NOT ONLY ARE WE INTERESTED IN

01:16:45.534 --> 01:16:47.402
THE CLEANUP BUT I'M ALSO VERY

01:16:47.469 --> 01:16:48.704
INTERESTED IN ENSURING THAT WE

01:16:48.770 --> 01:16:49.805
ARE CREATING JOBS IN OUR

01:16:49.871 --> 01:16:50.906
COMMUNITY.

01:16:50.973 --> 01:16:52.808
IN WHICH THE PEOPLE THAT

01:16:52.874 --> 01:16:54.876
ACTUALLY LIVE HERE HAVE AN

01:16:54.943 --> 01:16:56.912
OPPORTUNITY FOR THIS TYPE OF

01:16:56.979 --> 01:16:58.347
WORK AND THAT THE TRAINING IS

01:16:58.413 --> 01:17:00.649
AVAILABLE.

01:17:00.716 --> 01:17:02.217
SO I'M CURIOUS AS TO IF YOU'RE

01:17:02.284 --> 01:17:04.619
TALKING ABOUT FIVE TO FIFTEEN

01:17:04.686 --> 01:17:06.521
PROPERTIES OF WEAK RAMPING UP

01:17:06.588 --> 01:17:08.256
FROM FIFTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE

01:17:08.323 --> 01:17:09.424
PROPERTIES OF WEAK MOVING

01:17:09.491 --> 01:17:10.158
FORWARD.

01:17:10.225 --> 01:17:11.860
HOW MANY COMMUNITY MEMBERS ARE

01:17:11.927 --> 01:17:15.397
ACTUALLY CURRENTLY EMPLOYED?

01:17:15.464 --> 01:17:16.932
I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT

01:17:16.999 --> 01:17:18.700
QUESTION OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD

01:17:18.767 --> 01:17:19.334
BUT WE WILL GET THAT NUMBER FOR

01:17:19.401 --> 01:17:21.136
YOU [inaudible]

01:17:21.203 --> 01:17:24.072
YEAH.

01:17:24.139 --> 01:17:29.044
THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO US.

01:17:29.111 --> 01:17:33.648
YEAH SO MY ROUGH CALCULATION ON

01:17:33.715 --> 01:17:35.684
OF HOW MANY OF OUR JOB TO BE

01:17:35.751 --> 01:17:37.152
COMPLETE BUT TO COMPLETE PER

01:17:37.219 --> 01:17:38.553
MONTH IF YOU'RE DOING.

01:17:38.620 --> 01:17:40.655
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN FIFTEEN AND

01:17:40.722 --> 01:17:41.223
TWENTY FIVE AND WE SEEM AN

01:17:41.289 --> 01:17:43.025
AVERAGE OF TWENTY IS GOING TO BE

01:17:43.091 --> 01:17:44.593
SOMEWHERE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF

01:17:44.659 --> 01:17:45.961
EIGHTY FIVE PER MONTH.

01:17:46.028 --> 01:17:48.463
SENSES ARE ANOTHER WAY OF OF OF

01:17:48.530 --> 01:17:53.802
OF LOOKING AT WITH THE GOAL

01:17:53.869 --> 01:17:55.904
MIGHT BE HERE WHAT COURSE SHOULD

01:17:55.971 --> 01:17:58.306
WE WE ALSO ANTICIPATE THROUGH

01:17:58.373 --> 01:18:00.142
THE HOLIDAY SEASON.

01:18:00.208 --> 01:18:01.943
ARE MORE RELUCTANT TO HAVE THEIR

01:18:02.010 --> 01:18:03.478
PROPERTIES WORKED ON TO THE

01:18:03.545 --> 01:18:05.180
EXTENT WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO WANT

01:18:05.247 --> 01:18:07.716
TO WE WILL ABSOLUTELY MAINTAIN.

01:18:07.783 --> 01:18:09.351
THAT PACE THROUGH THE HOLIDAY

01:18:09.418 --> 01:18:12.154
SEASON BUT BUT THERE IS THE

01:18:12.220 --> 01:18:13.388
POSSIBILITY THAT FOLKS WILL BE.

01:18:13.455 --> 01:18:14.790
I UNDERSTOOD THAT THAT COULD BE

01:18:14.856 --> 01:18:16.792
COULD BE DIFFICULT TO HAVE ANY

01:18:16.858 --> 01:18:18.160
ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS.

01:18:18.226 --> 01:18:19.561
I DO ACTUALLY I HAVE ANOTHER

01:18:19.628 --> 01:18:21.963
QUESTION ON YOUR PREVIOUS

01:18:22.030 --> 01:18:23.065
PRESENTATION TO YOU JUST A

01:18:23.131 --> 01:18:24.599
COUPLE MINUTES AGO.

01:18:24.666 --> 01:18:25.867
ON PARKWAYS.

FROM THE OPERATIONS AT THAT SITE --

01:20:13.942 --> 01:20:17.045
THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE THE ABILITY

DONE.

01:20:24.319 --> 01:20:25.720
BUT I WOULD ADD THAT --

01:20:25.787 --> 01:20:27.055
IF WE FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THIS

01:20:27.122 --> 01:20:28.857
PARKWAY IS IF WE FIND OUT THAT

01:20:28.924 --> 01:20:30.025

ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO DEAL WITH

01:20:36.464 --> 01:20:37.699
THIS WHETHER WE USE.

01:20:37.766 --> 01:20:39.801
LEAD ACID BATTERY FINDING WHERE

01:20:39.868 --> 01:20:41.336
WITH THE FUNDING WOULD COME FROM

01:20:42.537 --> 01:20:43.405
LOOK AT WHAT WE NEED TO KNOW A

01:20:43.471 --> 01:20:45.140
LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE EXTENT

01:20:45.207 --> 01:20:46.741
OF THE CONTAMINATION AND THE UP

01:20:46.808 --> 01:20:48.376
PARKWAYS BEFORE COULD MAKE A

01:20:48.443 --> 01:20:49.644
FINAL RECOMMENDATION IS THAT

01:20:49.711 --> 01:20:51.179
SOME OF THE ONE OF THE THINGS.

01:20:51.246 --> 01:20:52.380
THAT WILL BE LOOKING AT

01:20:52.447 --> 01:20:53.548

AS SOON AS THAT WAS OVER WE

01:21:27.015 --> 01:21:28.216
START THE CYCLE OVER AGAIN IN

01:21:28.283 --> 01:21:30.819
THE WORK AT THE DEPARTMENT LEVEL

01:21:30.885 --> 01:21:32.721
AND IT -- IS

01:21:32.787 --> 01:21:35.590
IS ON GOING SO IN THAT --

01:21:35.657 --> 01:21:37.259
IN THAT VEIN.

01:21:37.325 --> 01:21:40.595
LET ME JUST SAY NOW THAT WE ARE --

01:21:40.662 --> 01:21:42.764

IF IT'S SO IN THE COMING GOT A

01:21:52.307 --> 01:21:53.942
BUDGET CYCLE IF FUNDS ARE GOING

01:21:54.009 --> 01:21:56.144
TO BE DEPLETED AND DISAPPEAR WE

WANT TO KNOW THAT SO THAT WE CAN

01:21:58.480 --> 01:22:00.515

OUR BUDGETS CAN LOOK LIKE THIS

01:22:01.549 --> 01:22:01.950
YEAR.

01:22:02.017 --> 01:22:03.685
BUT WE WANT TO TRY AND KEEP THIS

01:22:03.752 --> 01:22:05.754
PROCESS MOVING FORWARD AND MAKE

01:22:05.820 --> 01:22:10.458
ALLOCATIONS THAT ARE APPROPRIATE

01:22:10.525 --> 01:22:11.826

THAT INFORMATION.

01:22:15.463 --> 01:22:16.698
I COULD ADD TO THAT TO FINISH

01:22:16.765 --> 01:22:17.932
OFF ON MY QUESTION AND THE

01:22:17.999 --> 01:22:18.366
COMMENT.

01:22:18.433 --> 01:22:18.933
YOU KNOW THE PARK WHICH IS

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.069
SOMETHING THAT THE COMMUNITY HAS

01:22:21.136 --> 01:22:22.370
BEEN ASKING.

01:22:22.437 --> 01:22:23.371
FOR FOR WAS THE VERY BEGINNING

01:22:23.438 --> 01:22:24.639
AND SO WE TALKED ABOUT HOW

01:22:24.706 --> 01:22:25.874
THAT'S BEEN ALMOST SIX YEARS.

01:22:25.940 --> 01:22:27.042
AND WE FINALLY HAVE APPROPRIATED

01:22:27.108 --> 01:22:30.111
THE AND TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:22:30.178 --> 01:22:31.513
THEY'RE NOT LEFT BEHIND.

01:22:31.579 --> 01:22:33.415
AND WE KNOW THERE'S REALLY HIGH

01:22:33.481 --> 01:22:34.716
PROBABILITY THAT'S NOT GOING TO

01:22:34.783 --> 01:22:36.551
BE ENOUGH MONEY HOW MUCH WE NEED

01:22:36.618 --> 01:22:37.786
THIS HOLLY THE QUESTION THAT'S

01:22:37.852 --> 01:22:39.220
OUTSTANDING AND THAT'S WHAT THE

01:22:39.287 --> 01:22:40.689
TESTING WILL HELP --

01:22:40.755 --> 01:22:42.724
ANSWER BUT I THINK WE CAN NOW

01:22:42.791 --> 01:22:44.626
START. TO HAVE THAT DISCUSSION

01:22:44.693 --> 01:22:46.461
KNOW WHERE WOULD THIS MONEY COME

01:22:46.528 --> 01:22:47.996
FROM TO TO COME FROM.

01:22:48.063 --> 01:22:50.398
OUR GENERAL FUND IS TO COME FROM

01:22:50.465 --> 01:22:51.966
A BATTERY FIELD AND SOME

01:22:52.033 --> 01:22:53.234
MODIFICATIONS THERE IS A COMPANY

01:22:53.301 --> 01:22:54.369
SOMEPLACE ELSE.

01:22:54.436 --> 01:22:56.471
AND THAT WORK SHOULD BE DONE NOW

01:22:56.538 --> 01:22:57.906
WITH BUILDING TO BE INTRODUCED

01:22:57.972 --> 01:22:59.441
SHOULD BE INTRODUCED IN JANUARY.

01:22:59.507 --> 01:23:00.809
AND NOT WAIT UNTIL WE HAVE THE

01:23:00.875 --> 01:23:02.610
EXACT ANSWER OF WHAT WE'RE GOING

01:23:02.677 --> 01:23:03.178
TO NEED.

01:23:03.244 --> 01:23:05.480
I THINK BEING PROACTIVE IS

01:23:05.547 --> 01:23:07.482
ANOTHER WAY IN WHICH WE GAIN THE

01:23:07.549 --> 01:23:10.952
COMMUNITY STRESSED --

01:23:11.019 --> 01:23:12.987

SAY THAT THERE HAVE BEEN

01:23:15.090 --> 01:23:15.990
IMPROVEMENTS.

01:23:16.057 --> 01:23:17.325
SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS TO THE

01:23:17.392 --> 01:23:18.827
BEING ABLE TO LOOK UP ONLINE

01:23:18.893 --> 01:23:20.562

01:23:20.628 --> 01:23:20.862
WAREHOUSE.

01:23:20.929 --> 01:23:22.497
IT'S AN IMPROVEMENT ON THAT WE

01:23:22.564 --> 01:23:24.432
DIDN'T HAVE BEFORE --

01:23:24.499 --> 01:23:26.034
YOU KNOW HOW I MEAN I DO SAY I'M

01:23:26.101 --> 01:23:27.268
HAPPY IN MY HOUSE IS FAIRLY

GOOD SERVICE WILL BE PART OF THE

01:23:30.505 --> 01:23:31.272
WAY HER YOUNGER LOAD.

01:23:31.339 --> 01:23:32.774
IS REALLY GOOD AND WE SHOULD NOT

01:23:32.841 --> 01:23:33.808
FORGET THOSE.

01:23:33.875 --> 01:23:35.043
THOSE SUCCESSES BUT WE SHOULD

01:23:35.110 --> 01:23:37.312
NOT BE SATISFIED WITH THOSE

01:23:37.379 --> 01:23:38.947
SUCCESSES AND AND I THINK BE

01:23:39.013 --> 01:23:40.882
PRACTICAL HOW COMPLICATED THIS

01:23:40.949 --> 01:23:42.183
PROCESS IS AND TRY.

01:23:42.250 --> 01:23:44.919

01:23:56.731 --> 01:23:57.298
FRUSTRATING AT THE PACE AT WHICH

VOLUNTEERS TO GO DOOR TO DOOR WE

01:37:20.568 --> 01:37:23.370
KNOCKED ON HOUSEHOLD DOORS.

SANTIAGO WAS THERE AT THE

01:37:26.941 --> 01:37:30.811

01:37:38.085 --> 01:37:40.154
IT WAS A LEARNING EXPERIENCE AND

01:37:40.221 --> 01:37:41.589
ONE THAT WAS VERY HUMBLING.

01:37:41.655 --> 01:37:42.356
BECAUSE THERE WERE MANY

01:37:42.423 --> 01:37:45.292
RESIDENTS THAT WERE OF WANTING

01:37:45.359 --> 01:37:47.528

BUT DIDN'T BOTHER TO COME BACK.

01:37:53.734 --> 01:37:55.903
AND EXPLAIN WHAT THAT MEANT.

01:37:55.970 --> 01:37:57.671
AND MANY WERE CONFUSED ABOUT THE

01:37:57.738 --> 01:37:59.573
HEALTH IMPACTS AND WEREN'T FULLY

01:37:59.640 --> 01:38:02.543
AWARE OF WHAT THE POTENTIAL THAT --

01:38:02.610 --> 01:38:04.812
LEAD EXPOSURE HAS ON A PERSON'S

01:38:04.878 --> 01:38:06.413
BODY.

01:38:06.480 --> 01:38:08.449
AND I TOOK IT VERY SERIOUSLY

01:38:08.515 --> 01:38:10.084
BECAUSE SADLY WHAT I LEARNED IS

01:38:10.150 --> 01:38:11.051
THAT THERE WERE.

01:38:11.118 --> 01:38:13.787
A LOT OF MISCOMMUNICATION A LOT

01:38:13.854 --> 01:38:16.490
OF OF I THINK INABILITY TO

01:38:16.557 --> 01:38:18.292
COMMUNITY COMMUNICATE AND

01:38:18.359 --> 01:38:19.960

01:38:20.027 --> 01:38:22.263
COMPETENT MANNER. TO OUR

01:38:22.329 --> 01:38:24.698
COMMUNITY IT IS PRIMARILY AN

01:38:24.765 --> 01:38:26.233
IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY SPANISH

01:38:26.300 --> 01:38:28.469
SPEAKING DOMINANT SPEAKERS.

01:38:28.535 --> 01:38:30.838
AND OTHERS BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY

01:38:30.904 --> 01:38:34.408
I THINK WHAT I CAME AWAY WITH

01:38:34.475 --> 01:38:35.009
WAS THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK

01:38:35.075 --> 01:38:35.743
TO DO.

01:38:35.809 --> 01:38:38.245
AND IT CAN'T JUST BE THE STATE

01:38:38.312 --> 01:38:39.680
IT CAN'T JUST BE THE COUNTY.

01:38:39.747 --> 01:38:40.948
IT ALSO HAS TO BE OTHER

01:38:41.015 --> 01:38:43.884
STAKEHOLDERS AND I REALLY

01:38:43.951 --> 01:38:44.118
BELIEVE.

01:38:44.184 --> 01:38:48.155
THAT WE SELLS A DISSERVICE IF WE

01:38:48.222 --> 01:38:49.456

01:38:49.523 --> 01:38:51.825
WHAT THIS MEANS TO OUR YOUNG

01:38:51.892 --> 01:38:53.794

01:38:53.861 --> 01:38:56.196

ON THE CRITERIA THAT.

01:39:01.201 --> 01:39:03.304
THE DTS ASSETS AND THEY

01:39:03.370 --> 01:39:04.605
EXPLAINED THAT THERE WAS A YOUNG

01:39:04.672 --> 01:39:06.407
COUPLE THAT JUST PURCHASED A

01:39:06.473 --> 01:39:07.474
HOME THERE.

01:39:07.541 --> 01:39:09.276
AND BECAUSE OF THE CLEANUP.

01:39:09.343 --> 01:39:11.345
THE MOTHER THE FEMALE THERE WAS

01:39:11.412 --> 01:39:12.146
NOW GOING.

01:39:12.212 --> 01:39:14.315
TO HAVE A CHILD.

01:39:14.381 --> 01:39:16.250
WHAT DOES THAT SAY [inaudible]

01:39:16.317 --> 01:39:18.619
TO HER.

01:39:18.686 --> 01:39:20.688
IF HER NEIGHBORS AREAS AREN'T

01:39:20.754 --> 01:39:22.690
CLEANED UP AT THE SAME RATE AND

01:39:22.756 --> 01:39:25.359
MAGNITUDE OF HER HOUSEHOLD.

01:39:25.426 --> 01:39:27.261
HER NEIGHBORS.

01:39:27.328 --> 01:39:28.629
SO I HAVE TO ASK THAT QUESTION

01:39:28.696 --> 01:39:30.431
WHEN WE SEE WHEN WE REALLY THINK

01:39:30.497 --> 01:39:31.932
ABOUT WHAT WE'RE CLEANING.

01:39:31.999 --> 01:39:34.668
WHOSE HOUSE AND WHY NOT OTHERS

01:39:34.735 --> 01:39:37.304
AND WHY NOT THE PARKWAYS.

01:39:37.371 --> 01:39:38.806
AND I RAISE THAT ISSUE.

01:39:38.872 --> 01:39:40.941
I WENT TO SACRAMENTO AND TALKED

01:39:41.008 --> 01:39:42.509
WITH MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY AND

01:39:42.576 --> 01:39:43.410
THE SENATE.

01:39:43.477 --> 01:39:45.546
AND WE WE WORKED WITH OUR STAFFS

01:39:45.612 --> 01:39:46.580
TO TRY TO PROVIDE THE BEST

01:39:46.647 --> 01:39:48.849
INFORMATION BECAUSE WE DON'T

01:39:48.916 --> 01:39:50.217
THINK IT'S WORTH JUST CLEANING.

01:39:50.284 --> 01:39:52.486
THE SOILED AREAS IN THE FRONT

01:39:52.553 --> 01:39:53.754
YARD IN THE BACKYARD.

01:39:53.821 --> 01:39:57.257
IF YOU CAN'T PREDICT THE YOU CAN

01:39:57.324 --> 01:39:59.059
CLEAN THE PARAMETER THE PARKWAY

01:39:59.126 --> 01:40:01.795
IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE WHICH WAS

01:40:01.862 --> 01:40:04.698
DESCRIBED BY T. D. TSC IS PUBLIC

01:40:04.765 --> 01:40:04.998
[inaudible]

01:40:05.065 --> 01:40:06.633
AND THEN.

01:40:06.700 --> 01:40:09.069
RE EXPLAIN THAT EXCITES

01:40:09.136 --> 01:40:10.504
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CLEANUP OF

01:40:10.571 --> 01:40:13.107
ANY LEAD CONTAMINATION THAT

01:40:13.173 --> 01:40:16.744
INCLUDES IN OUR DEFINITION

01:40:16.810 --> 01:40:17.044
[inaudible]

01:40:17.111 --> 01:40:18.412
THE PARKWAYS.

01:40:18.479 --> 01:40:20.180
AND WHILE THESE HOUSES ARE BEING

01:40:20.247 --> 01:40:22.282
CLEANED AND NOW THE ONES THAT WE

01:40:22.349 --> 01:40:23.917
DID SEE.

01:40:23.984 --> 01:40:25.419
I MEAN I'M HAPPY ABOUT THAT I'M

01:40:25.486 --> 01:40:26.987
GLAD THAT THAT'S HAPPENING.

01:40:27.054 --> 01:40:28.722
BUT I'M NOT HAPPY IF WE THEN

01:40:28.789 --> 01:40:31.959
HAVE TO GO BACK TO YEARS LATER.

01:40:32.025 --> 01:40:33.894
AND FIGURE OUT THAT WELL SIX

01:40:33.961 --> 01:40:36.296
MILLION FOR CLEAN UP OF PARK

01:40:36.363 --> 01:40:38.532
PLACE IS NOW MADE AVAILABLE.

01:40:38.599 --> 01:40:39.299
AND THAT WON'T EVEN GET TO MAYBE

01:40:39.366 --> 01:40:42.002
THE TWO HUNDRED OR THREE HUNDRED

01:40:42.069 --> 01:40:43.504
THAT WE DO NEED TO CLEAN SO I

01:40:43.570 --> 01:40:46.106
I'M I'M CONFUSED ABOUT THE MATH

01:40:46.173 --> 01:40:47.207
THERE I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING

01:40:47.274 --> 01:40:48.142
TO BE SUFFICIENT.

01:40:48.208 --> 01:40:49.643
SO WE REALLY SHOULD BE DRILLING

01:40:49.710 --> 01:40:52.980
DOWN I THINK ON THAT ASPECT AND

01:40:53.046 --> 01:40:54.782
I AND I ALSO.

01:40:54.848 --> 01:40:55.916
BELIEVE THAT IT'S VERY IMPORTANT

01:40:55.983 --> 01:41:00.354
THAT EVENTS IN A WAY.

01:41:00.421 --> 01:41:02.656
THAT ARTICULATES A CONCERN.

01:41:02.723 --> 01:41:05.359
A WHAT THE DISADVANTAGES ARE IF

01:41:05.426 --> 01:41:08.695
WE DO NOT CLEAN UP THE INTERIOR.

01:41:08.762 --> 01:41:10.764
OF THE HOUSEHOLD AND IT ISN'T

01:41:10.831 --> 01:41:13.600
JUST A VACUUMING EXPERIENCE IT

01:41:13.667 --> 01:41:15.636
HAS TO BE METHODICAL IN IT HAS

01:41:15.702 --> 01:41:16.737
TO BE DONE BY COMPETENT

01:41:16.804 --> 01:41:19.139
INDIVIDUALS THAT CAN ASSURE US.

01:41:19.206 --> 01:41:21.175
THAT THERE IS SAFETY.

01:41:21.241 --> 01:41:22.876
AND THAT DOES LEAD LEVELS ARE

01:41:22.943 --> 01:41:24.945
NOT AT A HIGH RATE SO THOSE ARE

01:41:25.012 --> 01:41:26.713
THINGS THAT I BELIEVE HAVE TO BE

01:41:26.780 --> 01:41:27.414
DONE.

01:41:27.481 --> 01:41:28.916
AND I AND I I WOULD SAY YES

01:41:28.982 --> 01:41:30.384
THERE'S AN IMPROVEMENT SOMEWHAT

01:41:30.451 --> 01:41:31.518
OVER WHAT HAPPENED.

01:41:31.585 --> 01:41:32.920
A YEAR OR TWO YEARS AGO WHEN

01:41:32.986 --> 01:41:34.755
PEOPLE WERE GIVEN A COUPON THAT

01:41:34.822 --> 01:41:36.223
WAS MAILED TO THEM.

01:41:36.290 --> 01:41:37.858
THAT WAS IN ENGLISH NOT

01:41:37.925 --> 01:41:39.393
NECESSARILY IN SPANISH AND WAS

01:41:39.460 --> 01:41:41.295
NOT EXPLAINED PEOPLE THOUGHT IT

01:41:41.361 --> 01:41:43.163
WAS JUST ANOTHER ADVERTISEMENT

01:41:43.230 --> 01:41:44.565
COMING IN THE MAIL.

01:41:44.631 --> 01:41:47.367
IN FACT ONE OF MY ASSISTANTS IN

01:41:47.434 --> 01:41:49.336
MY OFFICE BROUGHT ME THAT COUPON

01:41:49.403 --> 01:41:51.738
AND I THOUGHT THIS IS INCREDIBLE.

01:41:51.805 --> 01:41:53.540
DID THAT WE ARE DOING THAT

01:41:53.607 --> 01:41:55.075
SOMETHING LIKE THIS IS OCCURRING

01:41:55.142 --> 01:41:58.645
UNACCEPTABLE IN MY OPINION --

01:41:58.712 --> 01:42:00.214
IT'S AN IMPROVED PROVED.

01:42:00.280 --> 01:42:01.482
PROCESS NOW.

01:42:01.548 --> 01:42:03.484
BUT MY NEXT QUESTION IS AT THE

01:42:03.550 --> 01:42:05.385
RATE OF CLEANUP IF WE ARE ONLY

01:42:05.452 --> 01:42:07.554
GOING TO DO TWENTY TO MAYBE

01:42:07.621 --> 01:42:08.522
TWENTY FIVE HOUSES.

01:42:08.589 --> 01:42:11.592
AND NOT THE PARKWAYS IT'S STILL

01:42:11.658 --> 01:42:13.393
GOING TO TAKE US.

01:42:13.460 --> 01:42:16.663
MAYBE FOR FIVE YEARS. FOR CLEAN

01:42:16.730 --> 01:42:20.167
UP OF OF A TOTAL NUMBER TWENTY

01:42:20.234 --> 01:42:21.902
FIVE HUNDRED OR TWENTY THREE

01:42:21.969 --> 01:42:22.903
HUNDRED AND I WOULD SAY THAT ONE

01:42:22.970 --> 01:42:24.605
OF THE ONE OF THE PRIORITIES

01:42:24.671 --> 01:42:26.306
THAT WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT AND

01:42:26.373 --> 01:42:28.075
I'M HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU ON

01:42:28.141 --> 01:42:28.742
THIS.

01:42:28.809 --> 01:42:29.476
IS TO SEE IF THERE'S A WAY TO

01:42:29.543 --> 01:42:32.346
GET MORE CALM IS HERE.

01:42:32.412 --> 01:42:34.081
BECAUSE IF YOU RELY ON ONE OR

01:42:34.147 --> 01:42:35.716
TWO THAT IS INSUFFICIENT I

01:42:35.782 --> 01:42:37.251
DIDN'T HEAR THAT DISCUSSION.

01:42:37.317 --> 01:42:38.886
AND THE POSSIBILITIES YOU HEARD

01:42:38.952 --> 01:42:40.320
ABOUT A NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO

01:42:40.387 --> 01:42:42.523
COULD BE HIRED UP AS CONTRACTORS

01:42:42.589 --> 01:42:44.491
WE OUGHT TO BE SOMEHOW

01:42:44.558 --> 01:42:45.592
INCREASING.

01:42:45.659 --> 01:42:48.195
THAT FEEL TEAM AND MAKING THAT

01:42:48.262 --> 01:42:49.596
INVESTMENT NOW.

01:42:49.663 --> 01:42:51.131
AND THEY'RE PROBABLY CAN BE

01:42:51.198 --> 01:42:52.399
MONEY FOUND IN THE BUDGET I

01:42:52.466 --> 01:42:55.302
WOULD HOPE AND MAYBE GOING BACK

01:42:55.369 --> 01:42:57.137
TO OF WHAT -

01:42:57.204 --> 01:42:59.039
SIMPLY MEMBER CHRISTINA GARCIA

01:42:59.106 --> 01:43:00.507
TALKED ABOUT WAS LOOKING AT THE

01:43:00.574 --> 01:43:02.075
BY THE BATTERY FEE THAT I

01:43:02.142 --> 01:43:03.944
BELIEVE HAS ANYWHERE FROM TWENTY

01:43:04.011 --> 01:43:06.046
MILLION OR MORE DOLLARS.

01:43:06.113 --> 01:43:09.049
THERE AND EACH YEAR THAT WILL.

01:43:09.116 --> 01:43:12.185
CONTINUE. TO INCREASE --

01:43:12.252 --> 01:43:14.922
I THINK IT'S EQUALLY IMPORTANT

01:43:14.988 --> 01:43:16.223
FOR US TO TALK ABOUT.

01:43:16.290 --> 01:43:18.225
WHAT OUR ROLE IS AT THE COUNTY?

01:43:18.292 --> 01:43:20.160
AND WE HAVE A ROLE.

01:43:20.227 --> 01:43:23.096
AND ON THE BUSES WE WERE WE WERE

01:43:23.163 --> 01:43:25.198
TALKING ABOUT WHO WAS INVOLVED

01:43:25.265 --> 01:43:26.500
AT THE LOCAL LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT

01:43:26.567 --> 01:43:28.101
WE'RE TRYIG TO FIGURE OUT HOW

01:43:28.168 --> 01:43:29.570
WE CAN EXPEDITE OUR PERMIT

01:43:29.636 --> 01:43:30.537
PROCESS.

01:43:30.604 --> 01:43:32.239
AND I THINK OUR STAFF WILL WILL

01:43:32.306 --> 01:43:34.474
HELP TO ADDRESS THAT.

01:43:34.541 --> 01:43:36.076
BUT I CAN TELL YOU THIS --

01:43:36.143 --> 01:43:38.145
CURRENTLY FOR A HOUSEHOLD IT IS

01:43:38.211 --> 01:43:39.813
GOING TO BE.

01:43:39.880 --> 01:43:41.481
PERMITTED TO BE CLEANED UP THE

01:43:41.548 --> 01:43:44.418
GOING RATE CAN GO ANYWHERE FROM

01:43:44.484 --> 01:43:45.018
SEVEN HUNDRED TO FOUR TO FOUR

01:43:45.085 --> 01:43:46.019
HUNDRED DOLLARS.

01:43:46.086 --> 01:43:47.220
PER HOUSE.

01:43:47.287 --> 01:43:47.888
WE'RE GONNA TRY TO DO AS BEST WE

01:43:47.955 --> 01:43:51.792
CAN TO REDUCE THAT AND THAT

01:43:51.858 --> 01:43:53.360
WON'T BE A COST.

01:43:53.427 --> 01:43:54.561
THAT WOULD BE PASSED ON TO THE

01:43:54.628 --> 01:43:56.196
HOUSEHOLD.

01:43:56.263 --> 01:43:58.298
OWNER OR TENANT IT WOULD BE IT

01:43:58.365 --> 01:43:59.700
WOULD GO TO DO TSC.

01:43:59.766 --> 01:44:01.201
BECAUSE WE ALSO HAVE TO HAVE OUR

01:44:01.268 --> 01:44:02.402
INSPECTORS.

01:44:02.469 --> 01:44:05.205
OUT THERE AND MONITORING SO I I

01:44:05.272 --> 01:44:06.840
WANT TO MAKE A COMMITMENT THAT

01:44:06.907 --> 01:44:08.609
WILL DO WHAT WE CAN.

01:44:08.675 --> 01:44:10.043
IN THAT MANNER --

01:44:10.110 --> 01:44:12.746
BUT I THINK THAT THE URGENCY.

01:44:12.813 --> 01:44:15.382
OF CLEANING UP.

01:44:15.449 --> 01:44:17.317
CAN'T BE UNDERSCORED ENOUGH.

01:44:17.384 --> 01:44:18.518
AND THAT WE REALLY HAVE TO

01:44:18.585 --> 01:44:19.853
UNDERSTAND.

01:44:19.920 --> 01:44:22.489
THAT ANY HOUSEHOLD IT HAS.

01:44:22.556 --> 01:44:24.024
AND THE ONES THAT WE SAW TODAY

01:44:24.091 --> 01:44:26.126
AT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT --

01:44:26.193 --> 01:44:28.295
THOSE ARE HIGH RISK PROPERTIES

01:44:28.362 --> 01:44:29.796
WITH A THOUSAND PARTS PER

01:44:29.863 --> 01:44:32.532
MILLION.

01:44:32.599 --> 01:44:33.767
AND THE STANDARD IS AS WE KNOW

01:44:33.834 --> 01:44:35.602
IS MUCH LOWER.

01:44:35.669 --> 01:44:38.305
SO WE ARE WE ARE ALLOWING FOR

01:44:38.372 --> 01:44:41.975
THIS TO CONTINUE IN THE NEXT.

01:44:42.042 --> 01:44:43.010
THREE TO FOUR FIVE YEARS AT THE

01:44:43.076 --> 01:44:44.678
SAME PACE.

01:44:44.745 --> 01:44:46.947
OF REMEDIATION I DON'T THINK

01:44:47.014 --> 01:44:49.483
THAT IS ACCEPTABLE BY ANYBODY

01:44:49.549 --> 01:44:51.418
WHO LOGICALLY LOOKS AT WHAT THE

01:44:51.485 --> 01:44:52.586
IMPACT.

01:44:52.653 --> 01:44:55.022
THAT LEAD POISONING HAS ON A

01:44:55.088 --> 01:44:57.591
CHILD ON A PREGNANT WOMAN AND ON

01:44:57.658 --> 01:44:59.126
INDIVIDUALS THAT REPRESENT OUR

01:44:59.192 --> 01:45:00.327
COMMUNITY.

01:45:00.394 --> 01:45:02.062
I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO YEARS

01:45:02.129 --> 01:45:03.930
AGO TO BRING UP A YOUNG MAN I

01:45:03.997 --> 01:45:05.966
DON'T KNOW IF HE'S HERE TODAY --

01:45:06.033 --> 01:45:07.968
ANTHONY THINGS HAPPENING

01:45:08.035 --> 01:45:08.268
[inaudible]

01:45:08.335 --> 01:45:10.404
AND UP.

01:45:10.470 --> 01:45:12.406
WHEN MEMBERS OF THE?

01:45:12.472 --> 01:45:16.176
COMMITTEE THAT WE SPOKE BEFORE --

01:45:16.243 --> 01:45:17.911
SAW THE PICTURES THAT I SHARED.

01:45:17.978 --> 01:45:20.313
OF THIS YOUNG MAN.

01:45:20.380 --> 01:45:24.818
HE LOOKED AS THOUGH HE WAS AGE.

01:45:24.885 --> 01:45:25.452
TWELVE WAS TWENTY SEVEN YEARS OF

01:45:25.519 --> 01:45:27.154
AGE.

01:45:27.220 --> 01:45:30.057
HAD SPINAL OF DISFIGUREMENT.

01:45:30.123 --> 01:45:31.591
BRAIN TUMOR.

01:45:31.658 --> 01:45:33.727
AND HAD OTHER AILMENTS HE LIVED

01:45:33.794 --> 01:45:36.163
VERY CLOSE TO EXCITE.

01:45:36.229 --> 01:45:38.398
NOT A BEAUTIFUL SIGHT.

01:45:38.465 --> 01:45:39.433
AND MAYBE THAT'S WHAT IT'S GOING

01:45:39.499 --> 01:45:41.201
TO TAKE FOR SOME PEOPLE TO TRULY

01:45:41.268 --> 01:45:44.104
UNDERSTAND THE MAGNITUDE.

01:45:44.171 --> 01:45:47.407
OF THE EXPOSURE OVER TIME.

01:45:47.474 --> 01:45:48.542
THIRTY THREE YEARS IS ONE PART

01:45:48.608 --> 01:45:51.344
OF IT BUT NOW A NEW LIFE A LIFE

01:45:51.411 --> 01:45:53.447
THAT IS IS TENDER THAT'S FIVE

01:45:53.513 --> 01:45:55.348
YEARS OLD IT'S GROWING UP HERE.

01:45:55.415 --> 01:45:58.385
IN OUR COMMUNITIES SHOULD NOT BE

01:45:58.452 --> 01:46:00.654
ALLOWED TO SUFFER.

01:46:00.721 --> 01:46:01.855
BECAUSE THIS WILL BE ONGOING FOR

01:46:01.922 --> 01:46:03.724

01:59:33.533 --> 01:59:35.868
THROUGH OUR COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH

01:59:35.935 --> 01:59:38.271
DEPARTMENT A THREE POINT FOUR

01:59:38.337 --> 01:59:40.273
MILLION DOLLAR GRANT FINE FROM

01:59:40.339 --> 01:59:41.374
THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND

01:59:41.440 --> 01:59:43.543
URBAN DEVELOPMENT. TO CONTINUE

01:59:43.609 --> 01:59:46.045
INTERIOR CLEAN UP SO I WANTED TO

01:59:46.112 --> 01:59:48.948
SAY THAT BECAUSE I'VE HEARD SOME

01:59:49.015 --> 01:59:49.782
BACK.

01:59:49.849 --> 01:59:53.352
NOISE THAT THE COUNTY HASN'T.

01:59:53.419 --> 01:59:55.655
AND INITIALLY WHEN WE STARTED

01:59:55.721 --> 01:59:57.590
WHEN I FIRST TOOK OFFICE ONE OF

01:59:57.657 --> 01:59:59.492
THE FIRST THINGS I ASKED ASKED

01:59:59.559 --> 02:00:01.527
WAS OUR STAFF. TO COME TOGETHER

02:00:01.594 --> 02:00:03.262
SO WE COULD DO SOME TESTING WE

02:00:03.329 --> 02:00:05.464
IMMEDIATELY PUT OVER TWO MILLION

02:00:05.531 --> 02:00:07.667
DOLLARS AND WERE ABLE TO SHOW

02:00:07.733 --> 02:00:09.969
THAT WE COULD TEST AT A FASTER

02:00:10.036 --> 02:00:10.169
RATE.

02:00:10.236 --> 02:00:12.104
THAN THE STATE COULD AND I'M

02:00:12.171 --> 02:00:13.272
GLAD THAT WHAT WE LEARN FROM

02:00:13.339 --> 02:00:15.675
THAT DTS C. HAS.

02:00:15.741 --> 02:00:18.044
HAS LOOKED AT THAT WE WANT TO BE

02:00:18.110 --> 02:00:19.779
HELPFUL WE WANT TO PROVIDE

02:00:19.845 --> 02:00:21.514
WHATEVER EXPERTISE WE CAN WE

02:00:21.581 --> 02:00:22.915
DON'T HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS BUT

02:00:22.982 --> 02:00:24.684
IF WE WORK TOGETHER I THINK WE

02:00:24.750 --> 02:00:25.351
CAN SOLVE.

02:00:25.418 --> 02:00:27.019
A LOT OF THESE PROBLEMS THANK

02:00:27.086 --> 02:00:29.055
YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU

02:00:29.121 --> 02:00:30.389
VERY MUCH AND I THINK --

02:00:30.456 --> 02:00:33.859
MS GARCIA HAS A QUESTION TO BE.

02:00:33.926 --> 02:00:35.061
I DO YOU --

02:00:35.127 --> 02:00:36.662
THIS PRAYER YOU SPOKE ABOUT THIS

02:00:36.729 --> 02:00:39.298
FALSE SENSE OF WE ARE SAFE IF

02:00:39.365 --> 02:00:40.766
IT'S FOUR HUNDRED FOUR FOUR

02:00:40.833 --> 02:00:42.468
HUNDRED PARTS PER MILLION AND WE

02:00:42.535 --> 02:00:43.102
KNOW THAT THAT'S NOT THE SAME

02:00:43.169 --> 02:00:43.936
WAY.

02:00:44.003 --> 02:00:44.971
YOU KNOW WE KEEP REFERRING TO

02:00:45.037 --> 02:00:46.238
THE CHILDREN AND INTO THE

02:00:46.305 --> 02:00:49.408
PREGNANT MOTHERS OUT THERE --

02:00:49.475 --> 02:00:50.610
BUT I MEAN I I THINK AND ALONG

02:00:50.676 --> 02:00:51.944
THAT VEIN.

02:00:52.011 --> 02:00:54.080
WHAT ABOUT EVERYONE ELSE ARE

02:00:54.146 --> 02:00:56.482
THEY SAFE AND?

02:00:56.549 --> 02:00:57.783
WHAT ARE THE EFFECTS OF THE

02:00:57.850 --> 02:01:01.320
CONTINUED EXPOSURE I IT'S THE

02:01:01.387 --> 02:01:02.922
THIRTY YEARS PLUS?

02:01:02.989 --> 02:01:04.724
YOU KNOW THE SIX YEARS THAT THIS

02:01:04.790 --> 02:01:05.858
THAT WE'VE ALL BEEN ENGAGED AND

02:01:05.925 --> 02:01:07.393
THEN WE'LL REPORT POSSIBLY

02:01:07.460 --> 02:01:08.527
ANOTHER SEVEN YEARS IF EVER

02:01:08.594 --> 02:01:09.328
THERE JUST WITH THE CLEAN UP AT

02:01:09.395 --> 02:01:10.529
LEAST A TEN THOUSAND MEAN I'D

02:01:10.596 --> 02:01:11.664
LIKE.

02:01:11.731 --> 02:01:14.300
TO INVITE A DOCTOR OF RAG AND TO

02:01:14.367 --> 02:01:17.003
COME UP ON HIS OUR TOXICOLOGIST.

02:01:17.069 --> 02:01:18.771
HOME AND I FEEL LIKE THIS IS A

02:01:18.838 --> 02:01:21.440
QUESTION OF THAT OF REALLY

02:01:21.507 --> 02:01:26.445
DEMAND SORT OF A VERY CONCISE

02:01:26.512 --> 02:01:27.847
KNOW AROUND THE TOXICOLOGY LAB

02:01:27.913 --> 02:01:31.784
DOCTOR MAYBE YOU CAN USE THE

02:01:31.851 --> 02:01:32.385
MICROPHONE THAT DON'T.

02:01:32.451 --> 02:01:37.690
AT THE LECTERN [inaudible]

02:01:37.757 --> 02:01:41.027
YEAH.

02:01:41.093 --> 02:01:42.028
YEAH IT'S NOT MY CAR.

02:01:42.094 --> 02:01:43.496
YEAH THANK YOU [inaudible]

02:01:43.562 --> 02:01:45.631
TEST TEST [inaudible]

02:01:45.698 --> 02:01:49.135
SO THE THE QUESTION ABOUT

02:01:49.201 --> 02:01:51.370
ONGOING OF LEAD EXPOSURE IN THE

02:01:51.437 --> 02:01:53.539
SITUATION AS IT IS IS QUITE A

02:01:53.606 --> 02:01:54.106
COMPLEX ONE BUT I'LL TRY TO

02:01:54.173 --> 02:01:56.242
CLARIFY.

02:01:56.308 --> 02:01:58.077
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT?

02:01:58.144 --> 02:01:59.445
THE MULTIPLE SOURCES OF LEAD

02:01:59.512 --> 02:02:01.080
THAT WE HAVE IN OUR ENVIRONMENT

02:02:01.147 --> 02:02:02.548
IT'S IT'S REALLY QUITE --

02:02:02.615 --> 02:02:04.784
QUITE A WIDE ARRAY AND WE OFTEN

02:02:04.850 --> 02:02:05.985
THINK ABOUT LEG PAIN IS BEING

02:02:06.052 --> 02:02:07.286
THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF LEAD

02:02:07.353 --> 02:02:08.587
EXPOSURE FOR MOST PEOPLE ACROSS

02:02:08.654 --> 02:02:10.122
THE COUNTRY.

02:02:10.189 --> 02:02:12.124
AND THAT STILL HOLDS TRUE TODAY.

02:02:12.191 --> 02:02:13.159
WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT'S GOING ON

02:02:13.225 --> 02:02:14.827
HERE HOWEVER IT'S A LITTLE BIT

02:02:14.894 --> 02:02:16.829
OF A DIFFERENT SITUATION?

02:02:16.896 --> 02:02:18.064
YES THERE ARE A LOT OF HOMES

02:02:18.130 --> 02:02:19.432
THERE THAT MAY HAVE LEAD PAINT.

02:02:19.498 --> 02:02:21.500
THERE'S ALSO A NUMBER OF HOMES

02:02:21.567 --> 02:02:22.268
THAT HAVE LIKE CONTAMINATION IN

02:02:22.334 --> 02:02:24.637
THE SOIL SEMI CONTAMINATION HAS

02:02:24.704 --> 02:02:26.238
BEEN DEPOSITED IN THAT SOIL.

02:02:26.305 --> 02:02:27.807
ACTUALLY NOT JUST FOR THE PAST

02:02:27.873 --> 02:02:29.675
THIRTY YEARS BUT FOR THE PAST.

02:02:29.742 --> 02:02:31.177
EIGHTY OR NINETY YEARS THAT THAT

02:02:31.243 --> 02:02:32.278
THAT PLAN ACTUALLY HAS BEEN IN

02:02:32.344 --> 02:02:34.113
OPERATION JUST EXCITED TO HAVE A

02:02:34.180 --> 02:02:35.448
PERMIT FOR THIRTY YEARS BUT HE'S

02:02:35.514 --> 02:02:36.882
REALLY BEEN GOING ON FOR SEVERAL

02:02:36.949 --> 02:02:38.350
MORE DCADES BEFORE THAT.

02:02:38.417 --> 02:02:39.385
AND THE MISSIONS THAT WERE GOING

02:02:39.452 --> 02:02:41.754
ON IN THOSE PREVIOUS YEARS WE

02:02:41.821 --> 02:02:43.022
DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THOSE

02:02:43.089 --> 02:02:44.290
LEVELS OF EMISSIONS WERE AND

02:02:44.356 --> 02:02:45.691
WHAT THE EXPOSURES MAY HAVE BEEN

02:02:45.758 --> 02:02:47.193
FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE LIVED HERE.

02:02:47.259 --> 02:02:49.795
ALL THOSE SEVERAL DECADES SO

02:02:49.862 --> 02:02:50.830
RIGHT NOW IT'S VIRTUALLY

02:02:50.896 --> 02:02:53.532
IMPOSSIBLE TO REALLY QUANTIFY.

02:02:53.599 --> 02:02:55.468
AND DETERMINE EXACTLY WHAT

02:02:55.534 --> 02:02:56.836
PEOPLE'S EXPOSURES MAY HAVE BEEN.

02:02:56.902 --> 02:02:58.504
THAT BEING SAID WHEN WE LOOK

02:02:58.571 --> 02:03:00.873
TODAY.

02:03:00.940 --> 02:03:02.742
IT'S A BIG MYSTERY BECAUSE WHEN

02:03:02.808 --> 02:03:04.110
WE TALK ABOUT SOMETHING LIKE

02:03:04.176 --> 02:03:05.277
LIKE LIKE PAINT.

02:03:05.344 --> 02:03:06.312
WE CAN LOOK AT THE LEAD PAINT

02:03:06.378 --> 02:03:07.913
AND WE CAN TAKE MEASURES THAT

02:03:07.980 --> 02:03:09.715
ARE NECESSARY IN ORDER TO

02:03:09.782 --> 02:03:11.150
PREVENT EXPOSURES TO LEAD PAINT

02:03:11.217 --> 02:03:12.551
INSIDE A HOME AND WE'VE GOT

02:03:12.618 --> 02:03:13.953
PROCEDURES AND PROTOCOLS FOR

02:03:14.019 --> 02:03:14.153
THAT.

02:03:14.220 --> 02:03:16.489
AND THEY WORK.

02:03:16.555 --> 02:03:17.056
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO LETTING

02:03:17.123 --> 02:03:18.057
YOUR SOIL.

02:03:18.124 --> 02:03:19.325
IT'S A BIG MYSTERY HOW DO YOU

02:03:19.391 --> 02:03:20.659
KNOW WHERE YOUR CHILD IS PLAYING

02:03:20.726 --> 02:03:21.794
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT THEY'RE NOT

02:03:21.861 --> 02:03:22.862
IN THE HOT SPOT HOW DO YOU KNOW

02:03:22.928 --> 02:03:23.295
THAT.

02:03:23.362 --> 02:03:24.163
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO PLAY IN

02:03:24.230 --> 02:03:25.598
THAT SPOT TODAY OR TOMORROW OR

02:03:25.664 --> 02:03:26.766
THE NEXT DAY AND HOW MUCH LATER

02:03:26.832 --> 02:03:28.200
THE REALLY NTERESTING.

02:03:28.267 --> 02:03:29.869
IT'S REALLY A GIANT QUESTION

02:03:29.935 --> 02:03:32.271
MARK AND WHEN WE GO AND SAMPLE

02:03:32.338 --> 02:03:34.373
THESE LOCATIONS ALL OVER THE

02:03:34.440 --> 02:03:36.175
COMMUNITY WE MAY FIND A HOT SPOT

02:03:36.242 --> 02:03:37.176
IN ONE HOME.

02:03:37.243 --> 02:03:38.944
WE MAY FIND THAT THERE'S NOT A

02:03:39.011 --> 02:03:41.447
HOT SPOT ANOTHER HOME BUT THAT

02:03:41.514 --> 02:03:42.414
HOME THAT WE DIDN'T FIND A HOT

02:03:42.481 --> 02:03:42.915
SPOT.

02:03:42.982 --> 02:03:44.683
MAY HAVE SEVERAL HOT SPOTS AND

02:03:44.750 --> 02:03:46.252
WE HAVE TO LOOK AT IT THAT WAY

02:03:46.318 --> 02:03:47.486
WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE NOTION

02:03:47.553 --> 02:03:49.455
THAT IF YOU FIND A HOT SPOT IN

02:03:49.522 --> 02:03:50.389
ONE PROPERTY.

02:03:50.456 --> 02:03:51.590
THAT YOU MAY ACTUALLY HAVE THE

02:03:51.657 --> 02:03:52.591
SAME KIND OF LEVEL OF

02:03:52.658 --> 02:03:54.160
CONTAMINATION IN THE NEXT

02:03:54.226 --> 02:03:55.327
PROPERTY.

02:03:55.394 --> 02:03:55.928
EVEN THOUGH YOU DIDN'T

02:03:55.995 --> 02:03:57.296
NECESSARILY FIND IT WITH YOUR

02:03:57.363 --> 02:03:58.297
SAMPLING.

02:03:58.364 --> 02:04:00.166
SO WE HAVE SITUATIONS WHERE ONE

02:04:00.232 --> 02:04:01.667
HOUSEHOLD NEEDS TO BE CLEAN THE

02:04:01.734 --> 02:04:03.102
NEXT HOME ISN'T ON THE LIST BUT

02:04:03.169 --> 02:04:04.203
THE HOME RIGHT NEXT TO THAT IS

02:04:04.270 --> 02:04:05.404
ON THE LIST.

02:04:05.471 --> 02:04:06.839
AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE WE NEED

02:04:06.906 --> 02:04:08.474
TO TAKE A MUCH MORE BROAD AND

02:04:08.541 --> 02:04:10.409
COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH BECAUSE

02:04:10.476 --> 02:04:12.845
EVERYONE IS EXPOSED TO ALL THE

02:04:12.912 --> 02:04:14.113
LIGHT IT'S NOT JUST ON YOUR

02:04:14.180 --> 02:04:16.182
PROPERTY OR JUST ON THE PARKWAY

02:04:16.248 --> 02:04:17.249
THAT MIGHT BE FROM YOUR HOUSE

02:04:17.316 --> 02:04:19.051
IT'S EVERYONE EXPOSED TO ALL THE

02:04:19.118 --> 02:04:19.451
LEAD.

02:04:19.518 --> 02:04:20.553
SO WE NEED TO TAKE A VERY

02:04:20.619 --> 02:04:22.087
COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH BECAUSE

02:04:22.154 --> 02:04:24.323
WE CAN'T QUANTIFY WHAT THAT

02:04:24.390 --> 02:04:24.924
EXPOSURES GOING TO BE FOR THIS

02:04:24.990 --> 02:04:27.626
COMMUNITY.

02:04:27.693 --> 02:04:29.094
BUT WE ARE ALL THAT RACE

02:04:29.161 --> 02:04:30.996
ANYWHERE IN THIS COMMUNITY NOT

02:04:31.063 --> 02:04:32.264
JUST CHILDREN AND MOTHERS.

02:04:32.331 --> 02:04:33.566
ABSOLUTELY ANY ALL ALL THE

02:04:33.632 --> 02:04:34.633
POPULATIONS ARE THE PEOPLE WHO

02:04:34.700 --> 02:04:35.968
ARE THE HIGHEST RISK.

02:04:36.035 --> 02:04:38.971
IN GENERAL WE WE SAY ARE THE

02:04:39.038 --> 02:04:40.005
MOTHERS MOTHERS OF CHILDBEARING

02:04:40.072 --> 02:04:41.473
AGE IN THE CHILDREN BUT

02:04:41.540 --> 02:04:43.742
CERTAINLY EVERYBODY IS AT RISK

02:04:43.809 --> 02:04:45.177
AND AND WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE

02:04:45.244 --> 02:04:46.312
END THAT HOLISTIC FASHION.

02:04:46.378 --> 02:04:47.413
I ASKED THAT QUESTION I KNEW THE

02:04:47.479 --> 02:04:48.314
ANSWER BUT I THINK IT'S

02:04:48.380 --> 02:04:49.782
IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT'S BEEN

02:04:49.849 --> 02:04:51.317
GOING ON FOR SO LONG THAT WE'RE

02:04:51.383 --> 02:04:52.418
STARTING TO NORMAL LIFE.

02:04:52.484 --> 02:04:53.853
WAS STARTING TO CHANGE OUR

02:04:53.919 --> 02:04:55.654
EXPECTATION EVER SINCE THEY ALL

02:04:55.721 --> 02:04:57.223
WELL I'M NOT AT A THOUSAND PARTS

02:04:57.289 --> 02:04:58.924
PER MILLION I'M ONLY A FOUR

02:04:58.991 --> 02:05:00.059
HUNDRED TOM OKAY BUT NOW WE KNOW

02:05:00.125 --> 02:05:01.260
THAT'S NOT TRUE ALL WHILE I'M

02:05:01.327 --> 02:05:04.230
NOT PREGNANT I DON'T HAVE A TWO

02:05:04.296 --> 02:05:04.563
YEAR OLD FROM.

02:05:04.630 --> 02:05:11.837
EVEN THE ONES THAT --

02:05:11.904 --> 02:05:12.304
GIVEN WHAT YOU JUST.

02:05:12.371 --> 02:05:13.072
TOLD ME WHICH I JUST LEARNED

02:05:13.138 --> 02:05:13.906
SOMETHING NEW ABOUT THE FACT

02:05:13.973 --> 02:05:14.840
THAT YES EVEN THOUGH THE WHITE%

02:05:14.907 --> 02:05:16.809
HOUSE OVER MIGHT NOT BE TESTING

02:05:16.876 --> 02:05:17.977
THAT THAT THOUSAND PARTS PER

02:05:18.043 --> 02:05:18.244
MILLION.

02:05:18.310 --> 02:05:20.746
I MEAN IT TO THEIRS OUT AT IT IS

02:05:20.813 --> 02:05:21.680
THAT WE'RE ALL EXPOSED.

02:05:21.747 --> 02:05:22.648
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY WE KEEP

02:05:22.715 --> 02:05:24.516
SPENDING MONEY IN THE IN THE IN

02:05:24.583 --> 02:05:25.851
THE PROCESS WITH TESTING.

02:05:25.918 --> 02:05:27.953
WHEN WE TAKE LESS IT'S CLEAN IT

02:05:28.020 --> 02:05:30.189
UP?

02:05:30.256 --> 02:05:35.594
I WELL THE SCHOOL WHILE YOU'RE

FROM EXIDE.

02:11:37.689 --> 02:11:38.390
THAT WE'RE GOING TO GET THIS

02:11:38.457 --> 02:11:40.025
MONEY BACK.

02:11:40.092 --> 02:11:43.095
AND SO WHILE IT IS.

02:11:43.161 --> 02:11:44.830
WELL IT IS --

02:11:44.896 --> 02:11:48.133
INCREDIBLY TIME CHALLENGING.

02:11:48.200 --> 02:11:49.501
IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT THAT WE

02:11:49.568 --> 02:11:51.336
UNDERSTAND THAT WE WANT TO HOLD

02:11:51.403 --> 02:11:54.172
EXCITE ACCOUNTABLE RIGHT NOW.

02:11:54.239 --> 02:11:55.507
THE MONEY APPROPRIATED AS

02:11:55.574 --> 02:11:57.643
TAXPAYERS DOLLARS FOR SOMETHING

02:11:57.709 --> 02:11:59.544
THAT A CORPORATION DID TO HARM

02:11:59.611 --> 02:12:01.580
OUR COMMUNITY.

02:12:01.647 --> 02:12:03.148
AND SO WE WE NEED TO FIGURE THIS

02:12:03.215 --> 02:12:04.650
OUT.

02:12:04.716 --> 02:12:07.386
IN IN A WAY THAT'S PRODUCTIVE IN

02:12:07.452 --> 02:12:09.254
A WAY THAT HOLD EXCITE

02:12:09.321 --> 02:12:11.823
ACCOUNTABLE IN A WAY THAT WE THE

02:12:11.890 --> 02:12:13.058
TAXPAYER.

02:12:13.125 --> 02:12:14.359
GET THIS MONEY BACK FOR OUR

02:12:14.426 --> 02:12:15.527
COMMUNITY.

02:12:15.594 --> 02:12:17.162
SO RIGHT NOW THE STATE IS

02:12:17.229 --> 02:12:19.164
PUTTING IT UP I'M SO GLAD TO

02:12:19.231 --> 02:12:21.066
HEAR THAT THE COUNTY HAS.

02:12:21.133 --> 02:12:22.934
ALSO ALLOCATED FUNDS I THINK

02:12:23.001 --> 02:12:23.869
THAT WE NEED TO WORK IN

02:12:23.935 --> 02:12:25.404
PARTNERSHIP ON ALL LEVELS OF

02:12:25.470 --> 02:12:27.105
GOVERNMENT FROM THE CITY

02:12:27.172 --> 02:12:29.808
COUNCILS IN THE SMALLER CITIES

02:12:29.875 --> 02:12:31.310
CITY OF LOS ANGELES.

02:12:31.376 --> 02:12:34.379
THE COUNTY THE STATE OF OUR NEW

02:12:34.446 --> 02:12:35.414
POTENTIAL GOVERNOR GETTING

02:12:35.480 --> 02:12:36.682
INVOLVED.

02:12:36.748 --> 02:12:38.183
IN ENSURING THAT THIS CLEAN UP

02:12:38.250 --> 02:12:39.251
THIS EXPEDITED.

02:12:39.318 --> 02:12:41.853
BUT WHILE THERE ARE FRUSTRATIONS

02:12:41.920 --> 02:12:43.488
THERE ARE ALSO THE REALITIES.

02:12:43.555 --> 02:12:44.723
OF HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT WE

02:12:44.790 --> 02:12:48.193
GET THIS MONEY BACK.

02:12:48.260 --> 02:12:50.195
MISTER SANTIAGO SHIP OF ONE I

02:12:50.262 --> 02:12:50.462
THINK --

02:12:50.529 --> 02:12:53.065
CALIBER SUPERVISOR ON POLICE.

02:12:53.131 --> 02:12:54.933
UP FOR HARD WORK AND HER TEAM AT

02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:57.703
THE COUNTY FAMILY AND YOU KNOW

02:12:57.769 --> 02:12:58.603
ONE OF THE CHALLENGES IS TO TAKE

02:12:58.670 --> 02:12:59.971
A LOOK AT THE POTENTIAL

02:13:00.038 --> 02:13:01.073
POSSIBILITIES TO CONTINUE

02:13:01.139 --> 02:13:02.207
COLLABORATING.

02:13:02.274 --> 02:13:03.909
AND MAYBE DOING MORE GOOD LOOK

02:13:03.975 --> 02:13:06.011
WE'VE HAD TTC IS OUTLINED A

02:13:06.078 --> 02:13:08.313
CHALLENGE --

02:13:08.380 --> 02:13:10.582
TO GETTING THE AGREEMENTS --

02:13:10.649 --> 02:13:11.249
THERE'S BEEN A NUMBER OF THINGS

02:13:11.316 --> 02:13:12.617
THAT MAYBE THERE'S ALWAYS THERE

02:13:12.684 --> 02:13:14.086
THAT THE COUNTY CAN HELP WITH.

02:13:14.152 --> 02:13:15.821
IF THEY'RE NOT GETTING THE

02:13:15.887 --> 02:13:17.289
PROPERTY AGREEMENTS TO CLEAN UP

02:13:17.356 --> 02:13:18.623
WHEN YOU'RE WALKERS ARE OUT

02:13:18.690 --> 02:13:19.624
THERE AND IT'S AN EFFECTIVE TOOL

02:13:19.691 --> 02:13:20.625
AND I THINK IT I THINK IT TAKES

02:13:20.692 --> 02:13:23.328
ON IT TAKES A LITTLE BIT OF TIME

02:13:23.395 --> 02:13:25.097
TO GRASP THE FULL BREADTH.

02:13:25.163 --> 02:13:26.465
OF THE ABILITY OF THE COUNTY TO

02:13:26.531 --> 02:13:28.200
POTENTIALLY PARTICIPATE AT THAT

02:13:28.266 --> 02:13:28.767
LEVEL BUT THERE MAY BE OTHER

02:13:28.834 --> 02:13:29.968
GAPS.

02:13:30.035 --> 02:13:30.802
OTHER BEEN OUTLINED AT THE

02:13:30.869 --> 02:13:32.437
WITHERS FURTHER COLLABORATION TO

02:13:32.504 --> 02:13:34.039
ATTACK SOME OF THOSE PROBLEMS.

02:13:34.106 --> 02:13:36.274
AND AS I'M HERE TALKING YOU

02:13:36.341 --> 02:13:38.043

02:13:38.110 --> 02:13:40.779
HAVE A CHALLENGE NOT NONE THE

02:13:40.846 --> 02:13:43.982
LESS TO CLEAN THIS UP AND I BUT

02:13:44.049 --> 02:13:45.050
THERE MAY BE AN OPPORTUNITY TO

02:13:45.117 --> 02:13:46.785
PROVE IT TO ADD VALUE TO WHAT WE

02:13:46.852 --> 02:13:48.320
DO WHEN WE STEPPED IN FRONT OF

02:13:48.387 --> 02:13:48.520
SOME.

02:13:48.587 --> 02:13:49.654
A NEIGHBOR --

I HSS OPPORTUNITIES OR MAYBE ALL

02:13:58.263 --> 02:13:59.464
THE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT WE MAY

02:13:59.531 --> 02:14:01.333
&lt;c.red&gt;AVE NOT TALKED ABOUT ONE WARM&lt;/c&gt;

02:14:01.400 --> 02:14:02.000
PART OF THAT --

02:14:02.067 --> 02:14:03.769
CONSTITUENT --

02:14:03.835 --> 02:14:04.903
EIGHT IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND I

02:14:04.970 --> 02:14:06.238
THINK OUTSIDE OF THIS

02:14:06.304 --> 02:14:07.139
CONVERSATION MAY WE CAN

02:14:07.205 --> 02:14:08.039
CHALLENGE OURSELVES TO

02:14:08.106 --> 02:14:09.074
BRAINSTORM A LITTLE BIT MORE

02:14:09.141 --> 02:14:10.409
WHAT WE'VE GOT AT THE STATE WHAT

02:14:10.475 --> 02:14:11.910
YOU'VE GOT AT THE COUNTY. TO TRY

02:14:11.977 --> 02:14:14.079
TO MAKE RESIDENTS OF HOLE WHERE

02:14:14.146 --> 02:14:15.714
IT WERE A GOVERNMENT THAT PASSES

02:14:15.781 --> 02:14:17.549
FILL THEM AND SO THANK YOU ONCE

02:14:17.616 --> 02:14:19.951
ONCE AGAIN. FOR YOUR

02:14:20.018 --> 02:14:21.119
COLLABORATION.

02:14:21.186 --> 02:14:22.120
I THINK THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY

02:14:22.187 --> 02:14:22.621
HERE.

02:14:22.687 --> 02:14:25.257
AND I AM NOT ASSEMBLY MEMBER I

02:14:25.323 --> 02:14:27.959
CAN'T AGREE WITH YOU OF I THINK

02:14:28.026 --> 02:14:30.629
THAT OUR ATTEMPT RIGHT NOW IS TO

02:14:30.695 --> 02:14:32.164
GET OUR BOOTS ON THE GROUND.

02:14:32.230 --> 02:14:33.832
WE HAVE A SLEW OF INDIVIDUALS

02:14:33.899 --> 02:14:35.100
THAT ARE HERE FROM THE

02:14:35.167 --> 02:14:35.967
DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND

02:14:36.034 --> 02:14:37.335
MENTAL HEALTH THEY'RE KNOWN AS

02:14:37.402 --> 02:14:38.937
PROMISED ON US.

02:14:39.004 --> 02:14:40.906
THEIR HEALTH NAVIGATORS THEY GO

02:14:40.972 --> 02:14:42.007
OUT IN THE COMMUNITY BUT THEY'RE

02:14:42.073 --> 02:14:44.676
ALSO HERE TODAY --

02:14:44.743 --> 02:14:46.945
GIVING INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT IT

02:14:47.012 --> 02:14:48.313
MEANS TO BE EXPOSED TO LEAD

02:14:48.380 --> 02:14:49.314
POISONING.

02:14:49.381 --> 02:14:50.449
EXIDE WITH SOME OF THE SIGNS ARE

02:14:50.515 --> 02:14:54.219
WHERE AND WE'VE HAD TEAMS GO OUT

02:14:54.286 --> 02:14:55.754
PERIODICALLY AND AS YOU HEARD

02:14:55.821 --> 02:14:58.156
FROM OUR DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC

02:14:58.223 --> 02:14:58.857
HEALTH WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE

02:14:58.924 --> 02:14:59.758
TO DO THAT.

02:14:59.825 --> 02:15:00.725
BECAUSE I REALLY DO BELIEVE THAT

02:15:00.792 --> 02:15:02.494
THE COMMUNICATION HAS TO HAPPEN

02:15:02.561 --> 02:15:04.329
ONE ON ONE IT CAN'T BE THROUGH A

02:15:04.396 --> 02:15:06.331
FLYER YOU CAN'T JUST BE GOING ON

02:15:06.398 --> 02:15:08.233
A PORTAL IT HAS TO BE MORE THAN

02:15:08.300 --> 02:15:09.568
THAT FOR THIS COMMUNITY BECAUSE

02:15:09.634 --> 02:15:11.269
THEY ARE CHALLENGED.

02:15:11.336 --> 02:15:12.270
AND THEY DO NEED TO UNDERSTAND

02:15:12.337 --> 02:15:14.105
THAT THERE ARE REMEDIES JUST TWO

02:15:14.172 --> 02:15:16.107
DAYS WHEN WE HEARD WHEN WE ASKED

02:15:16.174 --> 02:15:17.976
THE QUESTION ABOUT IF YOUR SOIL

02:15:18.043 --> 02:15:19.377
IS GOING TO BE CLEANED UP AROUND

02:15:19.444 --> 02:15:20.245
YOUR HOUSE.

02:15:20.312 --> 02:15:23.081
AND THE HOMEOWNER SAYS WELL I

02:15:23.148 --> 02:15:23.982
DON'T WANT YOU TO TOUCH MY TREAT.

02:15:24.049 --> 02:15:26.384
BUT THAT TREE IS IMPACTED BY THE

02:15:26.451 --> 02:15:28.720
SAME LEVEL OF POISONING LEAD

02:15:28.787 --> 02:15:30.989
POISONING AND THE HOUSEHOLD

02:15:31.056 --> 02:15:33.625
ORDER OR TEN IT DOESN'T REALIZE.

02:15:33.692 --> 02:15:34.493
THAT IF THEY DON'T REMOVE THAT

02:15:34.559 --> 02:15:37.062
TREE THERE ISSTILL GOING TO BE

02:15:37.128 --> 02:15:38.830
A LEVEL OF LET THAT IS STILL

02:15:38.897 --> 02:15:41.600
POISONOUS AND TOXIC WE NEED TO

02:15:41.666 --> 02:15:43.101
BE ABLE TO HAVE A BETTER.

02:15:43.168 --> 02:15:44.769
COMMUNICATION PROGRAM THAT

02:15:44.836 --> 02:15:46.238
ALLOWS FOR THAT INFORMATION TO

02:15:46.304 --> 02:15:48.974
BE MADE AVAILABLE IN A LANGUAGE

02:15:49.040 --> 02:15:50.175
AND IN A CULTURALLY COMPETENT

02:15:50.242 --> 02:15:52.110
MANNER SO PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT

02:15:52.177 --> 02:15:53.512
THEY HAVE CHOICES HERE.

02:15:53.578 --> 02:15:55.580
AND FURTHER MORE PEOPLE WANT TO

02:15:55.647 --> 02:15:56.882
HAVE THEIR HOMES CLEAN.

02:15:56.948 --> 02:15:59.484
IN THE INTERIOR THE UNDERSTAND

02:15:59.551 --> 02:15:59.918
THAT THEY WON'T BE

02:15:59.985 --> 02:16:01.920
INCONVENIENCED SO WE COULD TAKE

02:16:01.987 --> 02:16:04.789
THEM AS AS WAS SAID BY DTS SEE

02:16:04.856 --> 02:16:05.957
ON THE GROUND.

02:16:06.024 --> 02:16:07.259
THE PEOPLE COULD STAY SOMEWHERE

02:16:07.325 --> 02:16:09.094
ELSE WHY THAT REMEDIATION GOES

02:16:09.160 --> 02:16:11.563
ON AND I KNOW SOME PEOPLE DON'T

02:16:11.630 --> 02:16:12.931
FULLY UNDERSTAND THAT.

02:16:12.998 --> 02:16:14.499
BUT THIS IS WHAT THEY DID YOU

02:16:14.566 --> 02:16:16.201
KNOW LISA CANYON.

02:16:16.268 --> 02:16:18.136
THEY ALLOWED FOR PEOPLE TO GO

02:16:18.203 --> 02:16:21.006
STAY IN OTHER PLACES WHILE THE

02:16:21.072 --> 02:16:23.375
REMEDIATION OCCURRED.

02:16:23.441 --> 02:16:25.076
I DON'T SEE WHY.

02:16:25.143 --> 02:16:27.279
WE HAVE TO TOTALLY BE TREATED IN

02:16:27.345 --> 02:16:28.880
SUCH A DIFFERENT MANNER IT'S

02:16:28.947 --> 02:16:31.149
ABOUT EXPLAINING ON A VERY BASIC

02:16:31.216 --> 02:16:32.450
AND HUMAN LEVEL.

02:16:32.517 --> 02:16:34.152
AND I THINK WE'RE WE FEEL

02:16:34.219 --> 02:16:36.288
OBLIGATED TO DO TO HELP THEM DO

02:16:36.354 --> 02:16:38.423
THAT WITH WITH THE STATE AND

02:16:38.490 --> 02:16:40.792
WITH THE TSC AND WITH OUR LOCAL

02:16:40.859 --> 02:16:42.894
STAKEHOLDERS AND COMMUNITY BASED

02:16:42.961 --> 02:16:44.362
GROUPS.

02:16:44.429 --> 02:16:45.030
I HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE COUNTY

02:16:45.096 --> 02:16:46.932
AND I KNOW THAT WE HAVE A

02:16:46.998 --> 02:16:49.167
PATCHWORK OF JURISDICTIONS OUT

02:16:49.234 --> 02:16:50.268
HERE -- AND

02:16:50.335 --> 02:16:51.303
I'VE BEEN HEARING ABOUT THE

02:16:51.369 --> 02:16:53.071
CHALLENGE OF HAVING OWNERS OF

02:16:53.138 --> 02:16:55.006
PROPERTY TO HAVE TEN AND I WHO

02:16:55.073 --> 02:16:56.508
ARE NOT SIGNING THOSE AGREEMENTS

02:16:56.575 --> 02:16:58.143
TO COME IN AND DO THE CLEANUP I

02:16:58.209 --> 02:16:58.743
I THINK.

02:16:58.810 --> 02:17:00.312
WE GOT TO THE FIRST VERY ARE

02:17:00.378 --> 02:17:02.881
COMMITTING A LOT AND AND WE

02:17:02.948 --> 02:17:04.316
HAVEN'T GOT INTO ALL OF THEM BUT

02:17:04.382 --> 02:17:05.350
THAT WASN'T THERE THAT.

02:17:05.417 --> 02:17:05.917
YOU KNOW THAT A LOT OF DOOR

02:17:05.984 --> 02:17:07.185
KNOCKING WE WERE ABLE TO GET TO

02:17:07.252 --> 02:17:08.286
BUT NOW ARE HAVING A HARD TIME

02:17:08.353 --> 02:17:09.588
GETTING THEM TO CALL US BACK AND

02:17:09.654 --> 02:17:11.222
THEY KNOW THAT THEY HAD THESE

02:17:11.289 --> 02:17:12.824
LEVELS TO LET US IN TO CLEAN UP.

02:17:12.891 --> 02:17:14.259
THERE'S LOTS OF REASONS WHY

02:17:14.326 --> 02:17:16.394
INDIVIDUALS ARE HESITANT TO LET

02:17:16.461 --> 02:17:17.162
GOVERNMENT INTO.

02:17:17.228 --> 02:17:19.097
THEIR BACKYARDS FOR WHATEVER

02:17:19.164 --> 02:17:20.265
REASON ARE INTO THEIR HOMES AND

02:17:20.332 --> 02:17:21.533
THEIR PROPERTIES.

02:17:21.600 --> 02:17:22.767
AND SOME OF THAT HAS TO DO WITH

02:17:22.834 --> 02:17:24.135
CLINTON FOR SPENT --

02:17:24.202 --> 02:17:26.204
AND SO DO WE HAVE SOME SORT OF

02:17:26.271 --> 02:17:27.806
COMMITMENT AND THAT THAT'S WHAT

02:17:27.872 --> 02:17:29.074
THEY SHOULD BE WORRIED ABOUT

02:17:29.140 --> 02:17:30.408
THOSE THINGS ARE THE I MEAN.

02:17:30.475 --> 02:17:32.077
WHETHER.

02:17:32.143 --> 02:17:33.712
I WON PLACES UP TO CODE WHAT I

02:17:33.778 --> 02:17:34.546
ULTIMATELY IN ONE PLACE IS CLEAN

02:17:34.613 --> 02:17:36.781
RIGHT NOW FIRST AND FOREMOST --

02:17:36.848 --> 02:17:38.316
AND SO.

02:17:38.383 --> 02:17:39.250
WHEN I'VE TALKED TO THE FOLKS

02:17:39.317 --> 02:17:40.051
ARE LIKE WELL I'M NOT TAKING

02:17:40.118 --> 02:17:40.785
THERE IS AND I TALKED TO SOME

02:17:40.852 --> 02:17:41.453
FOLKS LIKE HAVE YOU DONE

02:17:41.519 --> 02:17:42.988

AND I'M NOT GOING TO TAKE THE

02:17:46.324 --> 02:17:47.525
RISK RIGHT NOW --

02:17:47.592 --> 02:17:49.327
AND SO WHAT WHAT HAPPENS I MEAN

02:17:49.394 --> 02:17:51.196
WHAT'S THE ANSWER TO THAT DO

02:17:51.262 --> 02:17:52.263
THIS QUITE A FORCE FOR THE FOR

02:17:52.330 --> 02:17:53.398
SOME PART OF IT AS A SECURITY

02:17:53.465 --> 02:17:56.034
THAT NONE OF THAT'S GONNA.

02:17:56.101 --> 02:17:56.668
COME INTO PLAY IN WHICH IS GOING

02:17:56.735 --> 02:17:57.869
TO CLEAN AND WELL I WOULD.

02:17:57.936 --> 02:17:59.571
I MEAN I I KNOW WE DON'T HAVE I

02:17:59.638 --> 02:18:00.672
DON'T KNOW IF WE HAVE A

02:18:00.739 --> 02:18:02.440
DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS HERE.

02:18:02.507 --> 02:18:03.842
WE DO SO WE CAN HAVE SOMEONE

02:18:03.908 --> 02:18:05.310
PLEASE COME UP.

02:18:05.377 --> 02:18:07.012
BUT THESE ARE THESE ARE

02:18:07.078 --> 02:18:08.380
QUESTIONS THAT WE'VE.

02:18:08.446 --> 02:18:09.080
ASKED ALSO IN TERMS OF

02:18:09.147 --> 02:18:12.617
IDENTIFYING.

02:18:12.684 --> 02:18:14.419
IT MAY NOT LIVE IN THIS AREA BUT

02:18:14.486 --> 02:18:16.921
WE ONLY HAVE TWO AND I THINK OUR

02:18:16.988 --> 02:18:18.657
OTHER DEPARTMENTS CAN BE HELPFUL.

02:18:18.723 --> 02:18:20.825
IN FINDING OUT WHO OWNS THE DEED

02:18:20.892 --> 02:18:22.293
WHO OWNS THE PROPERTY AND THEN

02:18:22.360 --> 02:18:24.195
CONTACTING THEM BUT DOING A

02:18:24.262 --> 02:18:25.196
COLLABORATIVE LEAVE WITH.

02:18:25.263 --> 02:18:27.432
THE TSC BECAUSE WE DO HAVE THE

02:18:27.499 --> 02:18:28.933
TAX ROLLS WE DO HAVE ALL THAT

02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:30.301
INFORMATION RIGHT AND NO ONE CAN

02:18:30.368 --> 02:18:32.037
WORK COLLABORATIVE I BELIEVE ON

02:18:32.103 --> 02:18:33.438
THAT ISSUE.

02:18:33.505 --> 02:18:35.740
WHEN YOU'VE DONE SOME CONTRACT%

02:18:35.807 --> 02:18:36.708
AND THEN THEY STILL LET YOU AND?

02:18:36.775 --> 02:18:38.910
I YOU KNOW AND SO I GET THE

02:18:38.977 --> 02:18:40.645
PROPERTY RIGHTS BUT I KNOW THAT

02:18:40.712 --> 02:18:42.347
THAT'S ONE OF THE HESITATION.

02:18:42.414 --> 02:18:43.548
ON SO I DON'T KNOW THAT

02:18:43.615 --> 02:18:44.816

02:26:05.223 --> 02:26:08.392
AREAS THAT IS REALLY MY BY THIS --

02:26:08.459 --> 02:26:10.394
COMPANY EXCITE.

NOW ONE OF THE SPEAKERS BEFORE

COMPANY HAD NOT BEEN AROUND FOR

02:26:15.333 --> 02:26:15.967
THIRTY THREE YEARS.

THAT DOES LEAD BATTERY RECYCLING

02:26:21.806 --> 02:26:24.742
HAD BEEN AROUND SINCE NINETEEN

02:26:24.809 --> 02:26:25.610
TWENTY TWO TWO YEARS BEFORE THE

02:26:25.676 --> 02:26:27.011
CITY OF MAY WOULD EVEN EXISTED.

02:26:27.078 --> 02:26:29.180
AS AN INCORPORATED CITY AND MANY

02:26:29.247 --> 02:26:30.948
OTHER CITIES IN THE SOUTHEAST

02:26:31.015 --> 02:26:32.283
MAYBE NOT LOS ANGELES.

02:26:32.350 --> 02:26:35.820
LOS ANGELES AROUND A BIT BEFORE.

02:26:35.887 --> 02:26:36.721
BUT THE AMOUNT OF DAMAGE THAT

02:26:36.787 --> 02:26:38.656
THIS COMPANY HAS DONE AND THE

02:26:38.723 --> 02:26:40.591
PREVIOUS COMPANY THAT WERE --

02:26:40.658 --> 02:26:42.293
PROPRIETORS OF THIS PLACE IN OUR

02:26:42.360 --> 02:26:44.695
COMMUNITY OF EXPOSING US TO LEAD.

02:26:44.762 --> 02:26:46.364
AND THE WAY THAT WE FOUND OUT

02:26:46.430 --> 02:26:48.299
WAS BECAUSE DTS HE HAD NOT DONE

02:26:48.366 --> 02:26:49.267
THEIR JOB.

02:26:49.333 --> 02:26:50.968
YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF REGULATING

02:26:51.035 --> 02:26:52.403
THE EMISSIONS FROM THAT COMPANY

02:26:52.470 --> 02:26:54.605
IN REGULATING OTHER CLEAN ABOUT

02:26:54.672 --> 02:26:55.907
THAT PLACE EVEN GIVING THEM YOU

02:26:55.973 --> 02:26:57.942
KNOW TEMPORARY PERMITS. FOR

02:26:58.009 --> 02:26:59.577
THIRTY YEARS SO THIS IS HOW WE

02:26:59.644 --> 02:27:01.145
CAME TO FIND OUT ABOUT THIS

02:27:01.212 --> 02:27:02.146
ISSUE AT THIS COMPANY.

02:27:02.213 --> 02:27:04.749
BUT THE HISTORY OF THIS COMPANY

02:27:04.815 --> 02:27:05.783
HAS BEEN AROUND FOR QUITE AWHILE.

02:27:05.850 --> 02:27:09.687
AND IT'S NOT REALLY. TO BE

02:27:09.754 --> 02:27:12.456
POSSIBLE TO SAY THAT THE WAY THE

02:27:12.523 --> 02:27:14.825
OF THE CLEANUP.

02:27:14.892 --> 02:27:15.927
SUCH A HIGH AMOUNT OF

02:27:15.993 --> 02:27:17.662
CONTAMINATION IT SEEMS THAT

02:27:17.728 --> 02:27:18.863
WE'RE INVITING SOMEONE INTO OUR

02:27:18.930 --> 02:27:20.164
HOME AND THEY COULD YOU HELP ME

02:27:20.231 --> 02:27:21.666
CLEAN UP MY PROPERTY CUT BECAUSE

02:27:21.732 --> 02:27:22.700
AT MY HOUSE.

02:27:22.767 --> 02:27:24.502
AND THE AGENCY IN CHARGE OF

02:27:24.569 --> 02:27:26.103
CLEANING JUST SAYS OKAY ROAD

02:27:26.170 --> 02:27:28.005
GOING TO CLEAN THE CLOSETS.

02:27:28.072 --> 02:27:28.539
WE'RE GONNA LEAVE THE LEAD

02:27:28.606 --> 02:27:29.507
EVERYWHERE ELSE.

02:27:29.574 --> 02:27:30.942
BECAUSE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

02:27:31.008 --> 02:27:33.411
DGSE CANNOT GUARANTEE THAT ALL

02:27:33.477 --> 02:27:34.445
THOSE PROPERTIES THAT ARE BEING

02:27:34.512 --> 02:27:35.813
CLEANED UP THEY ARE GOING TO BE

02:27:35.880 --> 02:27:37.548
LET FREE.

02:27:37.615 --> 02:27:38.049
THEY MAY GIVE SOME GIFT

02:27:38.115 --> 02:27:39.350
CERTIFICATE BUT THEN THAT

02:27:39.417 --> 02:27:40.718
DOESN'T STAY IN THE GROUND

02:27:40.785 --> 02:27:42.286
OUTSIDE OF THE STATE THE PARK

02:27:42.353 --> 02:27:43.287
RACE.

02:27:43.354 --> 02:27:45.156
THE LADIES IN THE WINDOW SILLS

02:27:45.223 --> 02:27:47.491
AND THAT IS INSIDE THE HOUSE IS

02:27:47.558 --> 02:27:49.193
THE LATEST FIGHT THE ADDICTS.

02:27:49.260 --> 02:27:50.795
SO JUST BECAUSE YOU FINISH A

02:27:50.861 --> 02:27:51.796
HOUSE IS NOT MEAN THAT HOUSES

02:27:51.862 --> 02:27:52.597
LET FREE.

02:27:52.663 --> 02:27:53.197
AND I THINK THERE WERE GIVING

02:27:53.264 --> 02:27:54.832
PEOPLE A FALSE SENSE OF SECURITY

02:27:54.899 --> 02:27:55.666
THING.

02:27:55.733 --> 02:27:57.134
OKAY HE LETTERS THE TAKING OUT

02:27:57.201 --> 02:27:58.302
OF YOUR YARD.

02:27:58.369 --> 02:28:00.071
THAT LEAD IS GONE BUT YOU KNOW

02:28:00.137 --> 02:28:01.339
WHAT THE WAY THAT.

02:28:01.405 --> 02:28:06.577
THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS

02:28:06.644 --> 02:28:07.478
DOING THIS CLEAN UP.

02:28:07.545 --> 02:28:08.579
IF YOU DON'T DO A CLEANUP BLOCK

02:28:08.646 --> 02:28:09.413
BY BLOCK YOU DON'T DO IN A MORE

02:28:09.480 --> 02:28:10.815
ORGANIZED WAY THAT THAT'S GOING

02:28:10.881 --> 02:28:11.649
TO COME BACK.

02:28:11.716 --> 02:28:12.817
AND WE HAVE THAT THAT EXPERIENCE

02:28:12.884 --> 02:28:13.417
IN MAY WOULD.

02:28:13.484 --> 02:28:14.885
BECAUSE WE PARTICIPATE IN THE

02:28:14.952 --> 02:28:15.419
CLEAN UP OF A PLACE CALLED

02:28:15.486 --> 02:28:17.555
PEDICLE WITH THE CITY LATER

02:28:17.622 --> 02:28:19.357
BUILT A PARK.

02:28:19.423 --> 02:28:21.058
SO WE HAD A BATTLE WITH THE PAY

02:28:21.125 --> 02:28:22.426
FOR MANY YEARS IN THE PROCESS

02:28:22.493 --> 02:28:23.828
THE WAY THE CLEANUP THAT SITE.

02:28:23.894 --> 02:28:25.329
BUT THEY DID A VERY YOU KNOW

02:28:25.396 --> 02:28:26.497
IT'S NOT A VERY GOOD JOB IN

02:28:26.564 --> 02:28:27.598
TERMS OF THE CLEAN UP.

02:28:27.665 --> 02:28:29.667
SO GUESS WHAT YEARS LATER IT'S

02:28:29.734 --> 02:28:31.369
COMING BACK.

02:28:31.435 --> 02:28:32.370
ALL THE CHEMICALS THAT WERE DOWN

02:28:32.436 --> 02:28:34.605
THERE BECAUSE EPA DID NOT DO A

02:28:34.672 --> 02:28:35.773
GOOD JOB OF CLEANUP NOW THEY'RE

02:28:35.840 --> 02:28:37.241
COMING BACK AND THE RE

02:28:37.308 --> 02:28:38.909
CONTAMINATED OUR COMMUNITY.

02:28:38.976 --> 02:28:40.645
SO IF YOU DO A CLEAN UP ONLY IN

02:28:40.711 --> 02:28:42.179
THE IMMEDIATE AREA AND YOU DON'T

02:28:42.246 --> 02:28:43.547
CLEAN UP WHAT'S NEXT DOOR LIKE

02:28:43.614 --> 02:28:45.249
TO RECEIVE THE OTHER PROPERTIES.

02:28:45.316 --> 02:28:47.118
THAT ARE THERE YOU'RE NEVER

02:28:47.184 --> 02:28:48.286
GOING TO GET RID OF THE LET.

02:28:48.352 --> 02:28:49.487
AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE

02:28:49.553 --> 02:28:50.521
SEE YOU KNOW THAT MAYBE THE

02:28:50.588 --> 02:28:52.556
STATE IN TEN OR TWELVE YEARS

02:28:52.623 --> 02:28:53.958
WITH A CLEAR VICTORY SAID OKAY.

02:28:54.025 --> 02:28:55.593
WE'VE DONE THE JOB WE REMOVE THE

02:28:55.660 --> 02:28:57.395
LET BUT THE LEAD IS STILL THERE

02:28:57.461 --> 02:28:58.529
THE KIDS ARE STILL THERE THE

02:28:58.596 --> 02:29:00.064
PEOPLE ARE STILL THERE.

02:29:00.131 --> 02:29:01.465
AND THE PROBLEM PERSISTS.

02:29:01.532 --> 02:29:03.367
IN MY COMMUNITY WE HAVE THE

02:29:03.434 --> 02:29:05.069
HIGHEST AMOUNT THE PROPERTIES.

02:29:05.136 --> 02:29:06.137
THAT ARE NOT GOING TO BE CLEANED

02:29:06.203 --> 02:29:07.104
UP ACCORDING TO A REPORT FROM

02:29:07.171 --> 02:29:09.206
THE LA TIMES PUBLISHED A COUPLE

02:29:09.273 --> 02:29:11.075
OF MONTHS AGO. SIXTEEN HUNDRED

02:29:11.142 --> 02:29:11.809
PROPERTIES IN THE TWO U. MAY

02:29:11.876 --> 02:29:14.111
WHAT WILL NOT BE CLEANED UP.

02:29:14.178 --> 02:29:15.813
IN ADDITION TO THE PROPERTIES IN

02:29:15.880 --> 02:29:17.748
THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES IN THE

02:29:17.815 --> 02:29:19.083
COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES.

02:29:19.150 --> 02:29:21.719
IN COMMERCE IN BOYLE HEIGHTS.

02:29:21.786 --> 02:29:22.920
IS ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND

02:29:22.987 --> 02:29:25.389
PROPERTIES THAT WILL NOT EVEN BE

02:29:25.456 --> 02:29:26.457
I LIVE I FOUND A HIGH AMOUNT OF

02:29:26.524 --> 02:29:28.059
LET.

02:29:28.125 --> 02:29:29.827
AND ONE OF THE PEOPLE THAT WORKS

02:29:29.894 --> 02:29:31.462
FOR THE AGENCY ASKED ME DID YOU

02:29:31.529 --> 02:29:32.830
ACTUALLY PUT OUT A LEAD BETTER

02:29:32.897 --> 02:29:34.298
YOU BACKYARD.

02:29:34.365 --> 02:29:36.500
YOU LEAVE A BARRIER YOU ARE A

02:29:36.567 --> 02:29:37.735
BETTER IN YOUR BACKYARD.

02:29:37.802 --> 02:29:38.836
HOW CAN YOU EVEN THINK OF THAT

02:29:38.903 --> 02:29:40.104
YOU KNOW WHY DOES IT HAVE A HIGH

02:29:40.171 --> 02:29:41.605
AMOUNT OF LEAD?

02:29:41.672 --> 02:29:43.174
IN IN THE BACKYARD AND NOT IN

02:29:43.240 --> 02:29:44.375
THE FRONT YARD.

02:29:44.442 --> 02:29:46.010
SO THIS IS THE TYPE OF SITUATION

02:29:46.077 --> 02:29:47.244
THAT WE SEE IT EVERY TIME THAT

02:29:47.311 --> 02:29:49.146
WE HAVE DEALT WITH THIS AGENCY

02:29:49.213 --> 02:29:50.247
AND WE HAVE REALISTIC COME TO

02:29:50.314 --> 02:29:52.083
THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE BEES

02:29:52.149 --> 02:29:53.451
PARTICIPATED IN.

02:29:53.517 --> 02:29:55.453
PANELS AND SESSIONS AT

02:29:55.519 --> 02:29:56.320
TESTIFYING AND SO FORTH AND SO

02:29:56.387 --> 02:29:58.356
ON BUT WE'RE NO CLOSER TO CLEAN

02:29:58.422 --> 02:30:00.057
UP THE SITUATION WE'RE NO CLOSER

02:30:00.124 --> 02:30:01.625
TO MAKING.

02:30:01.692 --> 02:30:02.827
OUR COMMUNITY HOLD AGAIN.

02:30:02.893 --> 02:30:04.061
WE JUST CANNOT COME AND SAY OKAY

02:30:04.128 --> 02:30:05.930
THE STATE HAS DONE THEIR DUE

02:30:05.996 --> 02:30:07.498
DILIGENCE WE CLEANED IT UP

02:30:07.565 --> 02:30:09.166
RECOVERED THE MONEY FROM EXCITE

02:30:09.233 --> 02:30:11.235
I REALLY DON'T THINK THAT'S

02:30:11.302 --> 02:30:11.869
SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD REALLY

02:30:11.936 --> 02:30:13.604
LOOK AT AND THE BASICALLY SAYING

02:30:13.671 --> 02:30:15.039
THAT.

02:30:15.106 --> 02:30:16.974
THE COMMUNITY IS NOT CLEANED UP

02:30:17.041 --> 02:30:17.775
THIS IS BASICALLY WHAT'S GOING

02:30:17.842 --> 02:30:20.277
TO HAPPEN WHAT IS HAPPENING AND

02:30:20.344 --> 02:30:21.145
WILL CONTINUE TO HAPPEN.

02:30:21.212 --> 02:30:23.013
I HAVE GOING ON TOURS NOT

02:30:23.080 --> 02:30:24.515
ANYBODY BY ANYBODY.

02:30:24.582 --> 02:30:25.750
BUT WE HAVE GONE ON THURSDAY

02:30:25.816 --> 02:30:27.284
NIGHTS HE CITES.

02:30:27.351 --> 02:30:29.286
IN MAY WHAT THAT WERE NOT BEING

02:30:29.353 --> 02:30:30.721
CLEANED UP ACCORDING TO ALL THE

02:30:30.788 --> 02:30:32.690
THE REGULATIONS THAT UP DTS HE

02:30:32.757 --> 02:30:34.325
GETS AS THAT WHICH I SAW KIDS

02:30:34.392 --> 02:30:35.793
RUNNING ON THE PHONE.

02:30:35.860 --> 02:30:37.194
OF THE YARD WHETHER CLEAN UP THE

02:30:37.261 --> 02:30:39.296
HOUSE OR CLEAN THE MULTI FAMILY

02:30:39.363 --> 02:30:40.197
PROPERTY.

02:30:40.264 --> 02:30:41.766
I SAW ANOTHER FLIGHT WITH THE

02:30:41.832 --> 02:30:44.402
WORKERS WERE NOW THE LEAD

02:30:44.468 --> 02:30:46.470
CONTAMINATION THEY'RE BEING TOLD

02:30:46.537 --> 02:30:48.506
TO DECONTAMINATE ONLY IF

02:30:48.572 --> 02:30:49.240
SOMEBODY FEELS THAT THEY SHOULD

02:30:49.306 --> 02:30:50.174
DO SO.

02:30:50.241 --> 02:30:51.041
THERE'S NOT REALLY A WAY TO

02:30:51.108 --> 02:30:52.076
PROTECT THE PEOPLE THAT ARE

02:30:52.143 --> 02:30:53.778
WORKING THERE --

02:30:53.844 --> 02:30:55.212
WE SAW OTHER PROPERTIES POSED TO

02:30:55.279 --> 02:30:56.414
YOU PACIFIC.

02:30:56.480 --> 02:30:58.082
WHERE THE DUST WAS FLYING TO THE

02:30:58.149 --> 02:30:59.417
OTHER NEIGHBORS HOUSES?

02:30:59.483 --> 02:31:00.651
BUT NOBODY BOTHERS TO TELL

02:31:00.718 --> 02:31:02.086
PEOPLE AND SAY YOU SHOULD NOT

02:31:02.153 --> 02:31:03.788
REALLY BE IN THERE OR THE PEOPLE

02:31:03.854 --> 02:31:05.489
LIVING IN THE HOUSE.

02:31:05.556 --> 02:31:05.990
YOU KNOW THEY SHOULD BE

02:31:06.056 --> 02:31:07.091
EVACUATED.

02:31:07.158 --> 02:31:09.760

NEED A REAL COMPLETE CLEANUP AND

02:31:19.870 --> 02:31:20.805
I DON'T THINK THAT THIS AGENCY.

02:31:20.871 --> 02:31:22.807
HAS THE ABILITY OR THE WILL TO

02:31:22.873 --> 02:31:23.741
DO IT.

02:31:23.808 --> 02:31:24.975
WE'RE TRYING TO MINIMIZE THAT

02:31:25.042 --> 02:31:26.377
THEY'RE TRYING TO MAKE IT

02:31:26.444 --> 02:31:27.978
SMALLER AND SMALLER AND SMALLER.

02:31:28.045 --> 02:31:29.313
YOU CAN'T GO EVEN THOUGH DEVELOP

02:31:29.380 --> 02:31:31.115
A PLAN TO CLEAN UP TEN THOUSAND

02:31:31.182 --> 02:31:31.982
HOMES.

02:31:32.049 --> 02:31:33.551
WHAT CAN WE DO FOR THE AMOUNT OF

ONE THAT REALLY ARE CONTAMINATED

02:31:35.119 --> 02:31:36.720
AND THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE THAT

02:31:36.787 --> 02:31:38.122
ARE CONTAMINATED CAN JUST BE

02:31:38.189 --> 02:31:39.256
CLEAN UP THE DIRT YOU HAVE TO

02:31:39.323 --> 02:31:40.624
CLEAN UP THE PEOPLE?

02:31:41.992 --> 02:31:44.595
PREVENT THIS FROM HAPPENING

02:31:44.662 --> 02:31:45.663
WE'RE NOT DOING THAT AND THE WAY

02:31:45.729 --> 02:31:46.931
I SEE THIS PLAN.

02:31:46.997 --> 02:31:48.666
IT'S NOT REALLY GOING TO WORK

02:31:48.732 --> 02:31:49.033

ACTUALLY BEFORE THAT TIME WE

02:32:58.035 --> 02:33:00.471
HAVE WORKED ON THIS FACILITY.

02:33:00.538 --> 02:33:04.308
IT WAS FIRST STARTED IN.

02:33:04.375 --> 02:33:05.276
NINETEEN TWENTY TWO IN NINETEEN

02:33:05.342 --> 02:33:06.277
TWENTY TWO THERE WAS NO CLEAR

HAZARDOUS WASTE LAWS.

02:33:10.681 --> 02:33:13.751
THAT INDUSTRIAL ACTIVITIES THAT --

02:33:13.817 --> 02:33:14.552

HAVE OVER HERE.

02:33:21.992 --> 02:33:23.427
BECAUSE I HAVE FOUR SITES THE

02:33:23.494 --> 02:33:25.996
FIRST ONE IS --

02:33:26.063 --> 02:33:28.599
NEAR THE CDC REPORT ON LAD

02:33:28.666 --> 02:33:31.168
STRESSES ONE THING.

02:33:31.235 --> 02:33:32.703
PRIMARY PREVENTION.

02:33:32.770 --> 02:33:35.072
REVENGE EXPOSURE BECAUSE ONCE

02:33:35.139 --> 02:33:37.341
EXPOSURE TO THIS CHEMICALOCCURS

02:33:37.408 --> 02:33:41.545
THE EFFECTS ARE IRREVERSIBLE.

02:33:41.612 --> 02:33:42.913
THIS IS A MAP OF THE X. I.

02:33:42.980 --> 02:33:45.182
FACILITY IN FRISCO TEXAS.

02:33:45.249 --> 02:33:46.183

IT MAYBE YOU CAN.

02:33:47.718 --> 02:33:51.188
THE PURPLE IS FIVE MILES.

02:33:51.255 --> 02:33:53.290
OKAY THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND

02:33:53.357 --> 02:33:54.825
POUNDS OF LEAD THE ONLY OPERATED

02:33:54.892 --> 02:33:57.428
FROM.

02:33:57.494 --> 02:33:58.796
NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR NOT FROM

02:33:58.862 --> 02:34:01.899
NINETEEN TWENTY TWO FROM.

02:34:01.966 --> 02:34:02.499
NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR TO TWENTY

02:34:02.566 --> 02:34:03.701
TEN IT'S ESTIMATED THAT THEY LOG

02:34:03.767 --> 02:34:05.636
THREE THOUSAND POUNDS OF WAS.

02:34:05.703 --> 02:34:06.670
IT'S A TWENTY FIVE SQUARE MILE

02:34:06.737 --> 02:34:08.339
AREA.

02:34:08.405 --> 02:34:11.241
IT'S BEEN CONTAMINATED.

02:34:11.308 --> 02:34:13.377
THIS IS A MAP OF THE OTHER GO

02:34:13.444 --> 02:34:15.879
SMELTERS THE CENTER OF THE

02:34:15.946 --> 02:34:17.982
CIRCLE IS EXCITE.

02:34:18.048 --> 02:34:20.284
THOSE OTHER FIVE WHITE MARKS

02:34:20.351 --> 02:34:22.152
THAT YOU SEE OUR OTHER LEAD

02:34:22.219 --> 02:34:24.388
SMELTERSTHEY DIDN'T PERMITTED

02:34:24.455 --> 02:34:27.024
BY THE CITY OF LA. TO BE.

02:34:27.091 --> 02:34:28.993
IN EAST LA.

02:34:29.059 --> 02:34:30.160
AND WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN IS WE

02:34:30.227 --> 02:34:31.962
GET PAST THE ONE POINT SEVEN

02:34:32.029 --> 02:34:34.064
MILES AND WE KEEP GOING.

02:34:34.131 --> 02:34:36.300
WE'RE GONNA RUN INTO DEPOSITION

02:34:36.367 --> 02:34:39.570
FROM THESE OTHER SMELTERS.

02:34:39.637 --> 02:34:42.039
DOCTOR LIVES HERE HE CAN ATTEST

02:34:42.106 --> 02:34:43.340
TO WHAT THESE FALLOUT PATTERNS

02:34:43.407 --> 02:34:44.441
LOOK LIKE.

02:34:44.508 --> 02:34:46.443
OUR OTHER EXPERT DR WELLS HAS

02:34:46.510 --> 02:34:47.044
BEEN A LOT OF TIME LOOKING AT

02:34:47.111 --> 02:34:48.612
THIS.

02:34:48.679 --> 02:34:50.648
THIS IS NOT ROCKET SCIENCE.

02:34:50.714 --> 02:34:51.682
THIS IS PROBABLY GOING TO END UP

02:34:51.749 --> 02:34:53.384
BEING THE LARGEST LEAD

02:34:53.450 --> 02:34:55.019
CONTAMINATED SITE CLEANUP IN THE

02:34:55.085 --> 02:34:57.588
HEMISPHERE AND IT'S GONNA COST

02:34:57.655 --> 02:34:59.189
OVER A BILLION DOLLARS.

02:34:59.256 --> 02:35:00.624
AND YET WE KEEP ASK WE KEEP

02:35:00.691 --> 02:35:02.459
ACTING LIKE.

02:35:02.526 --> 02:35:03.594
WE'RE JUST GONNA DO A HOUSE BY

02:35:03.661 --> 02:35:04.695
HOUSE.

02:35:04.762 --> 02:35:07.264
AS MANY ROLES IN.

02:35:07.331 --> 02:35:09.266
SO THAT'S WHY SOME OF THE BURGER

02:35:09.333 --> 02:35:11.101
SEE AND I WORKED ON THE BATTERY

02:35:11.168 --> 02:35:12.603
FEMALE.

02:35:12.670 --> 02:35:14.438
WE KNEW WE NEEDED A LONG TERM

02:35:14.505 --> 02:35:16.674
STABLE SOURCE OF FUNDING.

02:35:16.740 --> 02:35:18.375
WE KNEW THIS WAS GOING TO BE

02:35:18.442 --> 02:35:19.209
IT'S GOING TO BE ONE OF THE

02:35:19.276 --> 02:35:19.977
LARGEST CLEAN UP SITES IN

02:35:20.044 --> 02:35:21.412
HISTORY THE COUNTRY.

02:35:21.478 --> 02:35:23.547
WE'VE GOT TO STOP ACTING LIKE WE

02:35:23.614 --> 02:35:26.650
CAN JUST GET IN AND GET OUT --

02:35:26.717 --> 02:35:28.118
HERE'S THE CONCLUSIONS HERE'S

02:35:28.185 --> 02:35:30.688
WHAT WE NEED.

02:35:30.754 --> 02:35:31.855
FIRST OF ALL WE'VE GOT TO STOP

02:35:31.922 --> 02:35:33.057
TALKING ABOUT THE CLEANUP BREAK

02:35:33.123 --> 02:35:35.459
WE'VE GOT TO STOP START TALKING

02:35:35.526 --> 02:35:37.494
ABOUT THE POISONING RATE.

02:35:37.561 --> 02:35:39.663
BECAUSE WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT WE

02:35:39.730 --> 02:35:43.467
POISON A CHILD A DAY.

02:35:43.534 --> 02:35:45.335
JUST IN THE ONE POINT SEVEN

02:35:45.402 --> 02:35:46.503
MILES.

02:35:46.570 --> 02:35:48.505
IF WE LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED IN

02:35:48.572 --> 02:35:51.442
FRISCO TEXAS THAT NUMBER WOULD.

02:35:51.508 --> 02:35:54.211
RISE DRAMATICALLY OKAY.

02:35:54.278 --> 02:35:56.847
THERE IS NO MORAL CLARITY HERE

02:35:56.914 --> 02:36:01.485
ON WHAT WE ARE ACTUALLY FACING.

02:36:01.552 --> 02:36:03.253
WE'RE FACING A LARGE SCALE

02:36:03.320 --> 02:36:05.422
POISONING EPIDEMIC.

02:36:05.489 --> 02:36:07.091
OF PEOPLE OF COLOR AND YOU STILL

02:36:07.157 --> 02:36:09.426
LAY IN PARTS OF SOUTH CENTRAL.

02:36:09.493 --> 02:36:10.260
AND IF I WAS GOING TO COME TO

02:36:10.327 --> 02:36:12.096
YOUR HOUSE.

02:36:12.162 --> 02:36:13.864
AND TAKE YOUR CHILD OR YOUR

02:36:13.931 --> 02:36:15.265
CHILD OR YOUR CHILD OR YOUR

02:36:15.332 --> 02:36:16.934
CHILD AND POISON THEM IT WOULD

02:36:17.000 --> 02:36:18.635
BE AGAINST THE LAW.

02:36:18.702 --> 02:36:20.270
I'D BE ARRESTED I'D BE THROWN IN

02:36:20.337 --> 02:36:23.507
JAIL IT WOULD BE A MORAL STAIN.

02:36:23.574 --> 02:36:25.375
YET WE ARE ALLOWING THIS TO

02:36:25.442 --> 02:36:26.577
CONTINUE.

02:36:26.643 --> 02:36:28.512
AND WE'RE ALLOWING THE AGENCY

02:36:28.579 --> 02:36:30.180
THERE PRIMARILY BECAUSE THE

02:36:30.247 --> 02:36:40.524
PROBLEM TO TRY AND CLEAN IT UP.

02:36:40.591 --> 02:36:42.359
PART OF THE PROBLEM HERE IS A

02:36:42.426 --> 02:36:44.795
SOCIOLOGICAL PROBLEM.

02:36:44.862 --> 02:36:46.463
WE HAVE AN AGENCY WHICH I

02:36:46.530 --> 02:36:48.298
PERSONALLY HAVE WORK WITH THIS

02:36:48.365 --> 02:36:51.602
AGENCY SINCE ITS CREATION IN

02:36:51.668 --> 02:36:52.169
NINETEEN NINETY TWO SINCE IT

02:36:52.236 --> 02:36:53.170
BECAME DGSE.

02:36:53.237 --> 02:36:56.607
A SEPARATE AGENCY KELLY EPA.

02:36:56.673 --> 02:36:58.609
I HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED THE

02:36:58.675 --> 02:37:00.844
LEVEL OF DYSFUNCTION THROUGH.

02:37:00.911 --> 02:37:03.280
COUNTLESS OTHER AND BILL SUE WHO

02:37:03.347 --> 02:37:04.948
WAS THE FIRST DIRECTOR OKAY.

02:37:05.015 --> 02:37:05.949
THROUGH COUNTLESS OTHER

02:37:06.016 --> 02:37:07.084
DIRECTORS REPUBLICAN

02:37:07.151 --> 02:37:08.986
ADMINISTRATIONS AND DEMOCRATIC

02:37:09.052 --> 02:37:11.021
ADMINISTRATIONS DOES IT WORK

02:37:11.088 --> 02:37:13.190
WITH DGSE REALIZE THEY ARE AT

02:37:13.257 --> 02:37:14.625
THE HEIGHT OF THEIR DYSFUNCTION.

02:37:14.691 --> 02:37:16.960
OKAY IT'S IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE

02:37:17.027 --> 02:37:17.394
FOR THEM TO GET MORE

02:37:17.461 --> 02:37:18.562
DYSFUNCTIONAL.

02:37:18.629 --> 02:37:20.164
WE'RE SO LOOKING FORWARD TO

02:37:20.230 --> 02:37:21.365
HAVING SOMEBODY NEW HEAD THE

02:37:21.431 --> 02:37:23.600
AGENCY AND FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO

02:37:23.667 --> 02:37:25.068
BUT IN THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT

02:37:25.135 --> 02:37:27.037
THAT'S GOING TO TAKE US.

02:37:27.104 --> 02:37:28.939
WE'RE POISONING A CHILD TODAY.

02:37:29.006 --> 02:37:31.441
WE'RE POISONING A CHILD TODAY WE

02:37:31.508 --> 02:37:34.578
HAVE BABIES ARE BEING BORN PRE

LIBERTY OR THE PURSUIT OF

02:37:37.481 --> 02:37:39.883
HAPPINESS THERE BUT WHEN THEY'RE

02:37:39.950 --> 02:37:41.185
BORN LEAD POISONED [inaudible]

02:37:41.251 --> 02:37:43.654
SO.

02:37:43.720 --> 02:37:44.488
WE NEED TO THINGS FROM THE

02:37:44.555 --> 02:37:46.957
LEGISLATURE.

02:37:47.024 --> 02:37:48.592
WE NEED A STABLE SOURCE OF

02:37:48.659 --> 02:37:49.226
FUNDING.

02:37:49.293 --> 02:37:50.460
WE NEED THE FULL BATTERY FEE

02:37:50.527 --> 02:37:52.029
REINSTATED.

02:37:52.095 --> 02:37:53.630
WE ORIGINALLY CREATED IT TO BE

02:37:53.697 --> 02:37:55.332
FIVE DOLLARS AND I SEE THAT MATT

AND ONE OF THE THINGS FOR US IS

02:44:17.214 --> 02:44:17.747
THAT.

02:44:17.814 --> 02:44:19.749
WE NEED PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND

02:44:19.816 --> 02:44:21.718
WHAT HAPPENS.

02:44:21.785 --> 02:44:23.253

I GREW UP IN.

02:52:48.691 --> 02:52:49.892
END OF MAY WOULD.

02:52:49.959 --> 02:52:51.961
IN MY PARENTS STILL LIVE IN THE

02:52:52.028 --> 02:52:53.930
APARTMENT WHERE I GREW UP AND I

02:52:53.996 --> 02:52:55.465
WANTED TO SPEAK SPECIFICALLY TO

02:52:55.531 --> 02:52:58.301
TWO THINGS ONE BEING THE THE ONE

02:52:58.367 --> 02:52:59.268
THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED PARCELS

02:52:59.335 --> 02:53:00.169
THAT STILL HAVEN'T BEEN TESTED

02:53:00.236 --> 02:53:02.038
OR THEY'D THERE'S NO ACCESS TO

02:53:02.105 --> 02:53:03.206
THOSE --

02:53:03.272 --> 02:53:03.906
WHERE MY PARENTS LIVE IT'S

02:53:03.973 --> 02:53:06.542
THAT'S IT'S ONE OF THOSE ONE

02:53:06.609 --> 02:53:07.910
THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND SO --

02:53:07.977 --> 02:53:09.879
I ASSUME THE SITUATION MIGHT BE

02:53:09.946 --> 02:53:11.314
SIMILAR FOR THOSE OTHER PARCELS

02:53:11.380 --> 02:53:14.350
WHERE MY I REACHED OUT TO GET

02:53:14.417 --> 02:53:15.685
THE SOIL TESTED.

02:53:15.752 --> 02:53:16.886
THEY'VE TRIED TWICE BUT THERE'S

02:53:16.953 --> 02:53:20.056
A COMP IS ON THE PROPERTY.

02:53:20.123 --> 02:53:22.959
AND MY PARENTS ARE VERY FEARFUL

02:53:23.025 --> 02:53:25.428
AND TRYING TO ATTEMPT TO TALK TO

02:53:25.495 --> 02:53:26.362
THE LANDLORD BECAUSE OF

02:53:26.429 --> 02:53:27.964
HISTORIES OF EVICTIONS AND RENT

02:53:28.030 --> 02:53:29.298
INCREASES THAT MY PARENTS JUST

02:53:29.365 --> 02:53:30.833
KIND OF FORT.

02:53:30.900 --> 02:53:32.201
AND SO I HEAR IT.

02:53:32.268 --> 02:53:33.836
I HEARD THE THE CALL FROM THE

02:53:33.903 --> 02:53:36.773
PUBLIC WORKS AROUND NOT.

02:53:36.839 --> 02:53:39.008
TO THREATENING LANDLORDS AROUND

02:53:39.075 --> 02:53:40.743
CODE OF CONDUCT BUT I WOULD ALSO

02:53:40.810 --> 02:53:42.311
WANT TO HEAR AND SEE SOLUTIONS

02:53:42.378 --> 02:53:43.479
IN TERMS OF PROTECTION FOR

02:53:43.546 --> 02:53:44.747
RENTERS --

02:53:44.814 --> 02:53:46.449
AND ALSO IN DOCUMENT COMMUNITY

02:53:46.516 --> 02:53:47.784
MEMBERS BECAUSE WE LIVE IN A IN

02:53:47.850 --> 02:53:49.085
A AREA WHERE A LOT OF FOLKS ARE

02:53:49.152 --> 02:53:50.386
ALSO UNDOCUMENTED AND THAT'S AN

02:53:50.453 --> 02:53:52.955
ADDED FEAR.

02:53:53.022 --> 02:53:54.357
ALL WHEN IT COMES TO THIS ISSUE --

02:53:54.423 --> 02:53:55.057
AND WE WISH THAT SHOULDN'T BE A

02:53:55.124 --> 02:53:57.960
BARRIER TO HAVING A CLEAN HOME.

02:53:58.027 --> 02:53:59.896
AND SO THAT'S ONE ISSUE THE

02:53:59.962 --> 02:54:01.664
OTHER ISSUE IS AROUND CURRENT

02:54:01.731 --> 02:54:04.066
USE THAT WE HEARD AROUND FUNDING

02:54:04.133 --> 02:54:04.801
BEING TAKEN FROM THE BATTERY

02:54:04.867 --> 02:54:07.103
BILL. TO PAY BACK THE ONE

02:54:07.170 --> 02:54:08.070
HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX MILLION

02:54:08.137 --> 02:54:08.371
[inaudible]

02:54:08.437 --> 02:54:12.475
AT WHEN THE ONE HUNDRED AND

02:54:12.542 --> 02:54:13.009
SEVENTY SIX MILLION WERE

02:54:13.075 --> 02:54:15.611
ALLOCATED IT HAD BEEN PROMISED.

02:54:15.678 --> 02:54:17.180
THAT THOSE FUNDS WERE GOING TO

02:54:17.246 --> 02:54:19.448
BE RICH TAKEN FROM THE FOLKS

02:54:19.515 --> 02:54:21.651
THAT COMMITTED THIS ATROCIOUS

02:54:21.717 --> 02:54:22.618
CONTAMINATION.

02:54:22.685 --> 02:54:23.586
RIGHT BUT IT WAS ALSO

02:54:23.653 --> 02:54:24.954
RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS WOULD BE

02:54:25.021 --> 02:54:26.189
PAYING THAT BACK.

02:54:26.255 --> 02:54:28.324
AND SO WHEN THE MONEY IS BEING

02:54:28.391 --> 02:54:30.393
TAKEN FROM FUNDS THAT HAVE BEEN

02:54:30.459 --> 02:54:31.661
COLLECTED FROM THE BATTERY BUILT.

02:54:31.727 --> 02:54:34.063
IT'S PUTTING THE BLAME ON THE

02:54:34.130 --> 02:54:36.532
COMMUNITY THAT HAD BEEN IMPACTED.

02:54:36.599 --> 02:54:38.701
AND IT ALSO FEELS LIKE LIKE MY

02:54:38.768 --> 02:54:40.203
LOAN COLLECTOR OVER A BILL

02:54:40.269 --> 02:54:41.771
COLLECTOR WHEN THE FOR THE JOB

02:54:41.838 --> 02:54:43.105
ISN'T EVEN FINISHED HOW IS IT

02:54:43.172 --> 02:54:44.307
THAT FUNDS ARE ALREADY BEING

02:54:44.373 --> 02:54:44.974
COLLECTED.

02:54:45.041 --> 02:54:46.642
WHEN THAT WE STILL HAVE HOMES

02:54:46.709 --> 02:54:47.777
THAT HAVEN'T BEEN TESTED WE

02:54:47.844 --> 02:54:49.011
STILL HAVE HOMES THAT ARE

02:54:49.078 --> 02:54:50.346
CONTAMINATED?

02:54:50.413 --> 02:54:51.981
AND NOT ALL OF THESE HOMES HAVE

02:54:52.048 --> 02:54:55.384
BEEN CLEANED UP I HOPE THAT.

02:54:55.451 --> 02:54:57.186
AS AS REPRESENTATIVES YOU YOU

02:54:57.253 --> 02:54:58.421

THOSE FUNDS THAT WERE TAKEN FROM

02:55:14.303 --> 02:55:15.504
THAT I THINK IT'S COMPLETELY

02:55:15.571 --> 02:55:17.240
DISCUSSING THAT THEY'RE BEING

02:55:17.306 --> 02:55:18.374
USED.

02:55:18.441 --> 02:55:19.842

THE WAY THEY INTERPRET THAT BILL

03:00:34.256 --> 03:00:35.958
IS THAT THEY CAN USE IT HOWEVER

03:00:36.025 --> 03:00:37.560

OVER A YEAR TO GET US BACK IN

03:12:25.000 --> 03:12:27.936
THE FACE TO DO THE CLEANUP.

03:12:28.003 --> 03:12:30.572
THEY DELAYED AND DELAYED.

03:12:30.639 --> 03:12:33.275
WHAT HAPPENED IN THAT PROCESS?

03:12:33.341 --> 03:12:35.510
THE WORKERS SPACE.

03:12:35.577 --> 03:12:38.313
FINANCIAL HARDSHIPS AN ALARM HAD

03:12:38.380 --> 03:12:39.648
TO DO SOMETHING ELSE.

03:12:39.714 --> 03:12:41.616
A LOT OF THEM FOR THE FIRST TIME

03:12:41.683 --> 03:12:43.385
IN THEIR LIVES.

03:12:43.451 --> 03:12:45.887
FELL IN LOVE WITH A NEW ISSUE.

03:12:45.954 --> 03:12:47.289
A LOT OF THEM HAD NEVER WORKED

03:12:47.355 --> 03:12:48.456
ON A PROJECT ENVIRONMENTAL

03:12:48.523 --> 03:12:50.525
PROJECTS.

03:12:50.592 --> 03:12:52.127
BUT ONCE THEY GOT INVOLVED ONCE

03:12:52.193 --> 03:12:53.428
THEY INTEGRATED WITH THE

03:12:53.495 --> 03:12:54.696
COMMUNITY.

03:12:54.763 --> 03:12:56.197
THEY SAW ALL PURPOSE IN THEIR

03:12:56.264 --> 03:12:58.300
LIFE.

03:12:58.366 --> 03:12:59.301
AND THEY WANTED TO GO BACK TO

03:12:59.367 --> 03:13:01.136

KILLED IT.

03:13:06.808 --> 03:13:08.310
SO WE CAN HAVE AN AGENCY THAT

03:13:08.376 --> 03:13:10.578
DOESN'T CARE ABOUT US.

03:13:10.645 --> 03:13:12.113
ALL THEY CARE ABOUT USER

03:13:18.219 --> 03:13:21.089
AND I TOLD HIM DIRECTLY.

03:13:21.156 --> 03:13:22.357
BUT THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE DOING.

03:13:22.424 --> 03:13:26.761
IS GENERAL BUT I THINK IT'S TRUE

03:13:26.828 --> 03:13:27.062
[inaudible]

03:13:27.128 --> 03:13:33.068

COMMITTEE IS ENVIRONMENTAL

03:13:53.254 --> 03:13:55.590
JUSTICE COMMITTEE.

03:13:55.657 --> 03:13:56.658
SO WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF

03:13:56.725 --> 03:13:58.860
BUILDING.

03:13:58.927 --> 03:14:00.628
AN ALLIANCE BETWEEN THE LABOR

03:14:00.695 --> 03:14:02.497

IT HAS TWO APPROACHES WORK FROM

03:14:16.478 --> 03:14:18.013
THAT ANGLE IT HAS TO START FROM

03:14:18.079 --> 03:14:20.048
THERE.

03:14:20.115 --> 03:14:22.083
BUT THEY DON'T LOOK AT THE MONEY

03:14:22.150 --> 03:14:24.652
THEY LOOK AT THE POWER.

03:14:24.719 --> 03:14:26.788
WE CANNOT STAND FOR THAT

03:14:26.855 --> 03:14:27.088

BEING DEBATED COMMUNITY AND ALL

03:34:06.433 --> 03:34:07.901
SORT OF THING?

03:34:07.968 --> 03:34:10.337
THERE WAS A LOT OF TALK ABOUT.

03:34:10.404 --> 03:34:12.072
THE MILLION BETWEEN ONE FIFTY

03:34:12.139 --> 03:34:12.906
THREE AND THE OTHER THE ABILITY

03:34:12.973 --> 03:34:14.208
TO BE CLEAR ABOUT THE INTENTION

03:34:14.274 --> 03:34:16.843
OF THAT BUILDING UP BUILDING OUT

03:34:16.910 --> 03:34:19.112
HALF.

03:34:19.179 --> 03:34:23.550
HE PAID BACK OF THE BUILDING

03:34:23.617 --> 03:34:29.590
AFFIRMATION THAT.

03:34:29.656 --> 03:34:31.124
WE KNOW WE HAVE MORE AFFECTED

03:34:31.191 --> 03:34:32.626
HOMES OUT THERE [inaudible]

03:34:32.693 --> 03:34:34.828
OKAY.

03:34:34.895 --> 03:34:37.064
AND JANE WILLIAMS TALK ABOUT THE

03:34:37.130 --> 03:34:38.465
ATROCITIES OF MATCHES HAVING

03:34:38.532 --> 03:34:39.566
THAT WHEN THE BECAUSE IT

03:34:39.633 --> 03:34:40.334
HAPPENED WE WERE NEGOTIATING

03:34:40.400 --> 03:34:41.401
THAT.

03:34:41.468 --> 03:34:42.169
ATROCITY ALSO WHEN OUR MONEY IS

03:34:42.236 --> 03:34:43.770
BEING TAKEN AWAY --

03:34:43.837 --> 03:34:44.638
INSTEAD OF TO THE LEFT THERE SO

03:34:44.705 --> 03:34:45.706
WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN USE

03:34:45.772 --> 03:34:46.640
IT FOR ALL OF OUR HOMES IF WE

03:34:46.707 --> 03:34:47.874
HAVE A RAINY FUN FOR THE STATE

03:34:47.941 --> 03:34:49.443
WE COULD HAVE A RAINY FUN FOR

03:34:49.509 --> 03:34:50.577
THIS COMMUNITY AND THAT'S WHAT

03:34:50.644 --> 03:34:51.979
THAT BILL IS ABOUT.

03:34:52.045 --> 03:34:53.113
ON AND SO I HOPE THAT MOVING

03:34:53.180 --> 03:34:54.915
FORWARD WE GUARANTEED THROUGH

03:34:54.982 --> 03:34:56.316
LEGISLATION.

03:34:56.383 --> 03:34:57.784
THAT THAT MONEY CANNOT BE USED

03:34:57.851 --> 03:34:59.353
TO PAY BACK THE LOAN UNTIL

03:34:59.419 --> 03:35:00.988
EVERYTHING HAS BEEN CLEANED UP.

03:35:01.054 --> 03:35:02.923
THROUGH LEGISLATION.

03:35:02.990 --> 03:35:06.360
THAT IS THAT WE KNOW THAT WE

03:35:06.426 --> 03:35:08.228
NEED AND NOT JUST THE DOLLARS WE

03:35:08.295 --> 03:35:09.096
HAVE NOW.

03:35:09.162 --> 03:35:10.497
WORSE OFF IN THE NEAR FUTURE

03:35:10.564 --> 03:35:11.565
THAT BILL IS GOING TO BE CUT

03:35:11.632 --> 03:35:12.899
EVEN FURTHER BECAUSE IT'S PART

03:35:12.966 --> 03:35:14.034
OF IT SUNSETS.

03:35:14.101 --> 03:35:15.068
AND I HOPE THAT WE ALSO DO THE

03:35:15.135 --> 03:35:15.936
OPPOSITE COMMUNITY TO

03:35:16.003 --> 03:35:17.271
LEGISLATION TO MAKE SURE THAT

03:35:17.337 --> 03:35:19.306
THAT DOES NOT SUNSET.

03:35:19.373 --> 03:35:20.440
ON AND IT'S USED FOR ITS

03:35:20.507 --> 03:35:21.942
INTENDED PURPOSES WHICH WAS TO

03:35:22.009 --> 03:35:23.610
CLEAN UP EXCITED THE OTHERS

03:35:23.677 --> 03:35:25.178
MONITORING SITES ARE ALSO FROM

03:35:25.245 --> 03:35:26.480
BATTERY --

03:35:26.546 --> 03:35:28.148
CONTAMINATION IN THE AREA

03:35:28.215 --> 03:35:29.783
BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST EXCITED.

03:35:29.850 --> 03:35:33.787
AND SO I THINK IT'S FRUSTRATING

03:35:33.854 --> 03:35:35.522
TO COME HERE AGAIN.

03:35:35.589 --> 03:35:36.223
IT'S FRUSTRATING AS AN AUTHOR OF

03:35:36.290 --> 03:35:37.924
A BILL THAT PROMISES COMMUNITY

03:35:37.991 --> 03:35:38.525
THAT IT WAS GOING TO BE

03:35:38.592 --> 03:35:40.594
DIFFERENT. TO THEN HAVE IT BE

03:35:40.661 --> 03:35:42.129
USED OTHERWISE AND SETTLED

03:35:42.195 --> 03:35:44.631
MOVING FORWARD WE HAVE THE FOCUS

03:35:44.698 --> 03:35:45.832
TO FIGHT TOGETHER TO MAKE SURE

03:35:45.899 --> 03:35:47.334
NO ONE SAT BEHIND THE DEFINED

03:35:47.401 --> 03:35:49.069
TOGETHER TO FINE TUNE THAT BUILD.

03:35:49.136 --> 03:35:50.504
ON AND MAKE SURE THAT WE DOESN'T

03:35:50.570 --> 03:35:51.705
HAPPEN AGAIN.

03:35:51.772 --> 03:35:53.407
AND AGAIN WE'VE TALKED ABOUT HOW

03:35:53.473 --> 03:35:55.642
WE CAN JUST FOCUS ON THE MOST

03:35:55.709 --> 03:35:57.611
CONTAMINATED HOMES WE CAN'T JUST

03:35:57.678 --> 03:35:59.079
FOCUS ON THE MOTHERS.

03:35:59.146 --> 03:36:00.881
AND BABIES WE CAN'T JUST FOCUS

03:36:00.947 --> 03:36:02.182
ON BOYLE HEIGHTS VERY

03:36:02.249 --> 03:36:03.350
APPRECIATIVE OF THE WORK THAT

03:36:03.417 --> 03:36:04.918
BULL HEADEDNESS DONE.

03:36:04.985 --> 03:36:06.820
BUT IT'S MUCH BIGGER THAN JUST

03:36:06.887 --> 03:36:08.455
THE SALLY AMPLE HIGHLIGHTED

03:36:08.522 --> 03:36:10.490
INCLUDES MADE WOULD HIDING THEM

03:36:10.557 --> 03:36:11.158
PART.

03:36:11.224 --> 03:36:13.493
BELL CLIMBERS WHO KNOWS WHAT'S

03:36:13.560 --> 03:36:14.294
OUT THERE I THINK WE NEED TO

03:36:14.361 --> 03:36:15.829
REPEAT ALL THEIR NEEDS HAVE NOT

03:36:15.896 --> 03:36:17.364
WE'RE GONNA FORGET THEM AND

03:36:17.431 --> 03:36:19.266
WE'RE GOING TO LEAVE THEM BEHIND.

03:36:19.333 --> 03:36:23.970
ON SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE

03:36:24.037 --> 03:36:27.541
THAT WE CREATIVE AND I THINK

03:36:27.607 --> 03:36:29.042
FINALLY WHATEVER.

03:36:29.109 --> 03:36:30.410
LAST WEEK OR SAID ABOUT.

03:36:30.477 --> 03:36:32.346
WE NEED TO ALLOW THE COMMUNITY

03:36:32.412 --> 03:36:32.846
TO BE PART OF MAKING THE

03:36:32.913 --> 03:36:33.680
DECISION.

03:36:33.747 --> 03:36:35.115
IS NOT JUST BECAUSE WE KNOW

03:36:35.182 --> 03:36:36.550
BETTER BUT THIS IS OUR HOME IN

03:36:36.616 --> 03:36:37.851
OUR BACKYARD WE SHOULD HAVE

03:36:37.918 --> 03:36:39.319
SOMETHING IN THIS CITY NEEDS TO

03:36:39.386 --> 03:36:40.787
BE A COMPROMISE.

03:36:40.854 --> 03:36:42.589
YES COMPROMISE BOTH WAYS AND

03:36:42.656 --> 03:36:44.191
MAYBE WILL TAKE SOME OF WHAT THE

03:36:44.257 --> 03:36:44.758
OTHER SIDE IS SAYING BUT A

03:36:44.825 --> 03:36:45.959
HASSLE.

03:36:46.026 --> 03:36:47.661
IT'S BEEN MOSTLY WENT AWAY ON

03:36:47.728 --> 03:36:48.995
AND SO I HOPE THAT FOR THOSE OF

03:36:49.062 --> 03:36:50.931
THE TERM POWER WE START TO LET

03:36:50.997 --> 03:36:52.499
THEM SET THE AGENDA A LITTLE BIT

03:36:52.566 --> 03:36:53.867
MORE BECAUSE MAYBE WILL HAVE.

03:36:53.934 --> 03:36:55.335
LESS ANGRY PEOPLE AND MAYBE

03:36:55.402 --> 03:36:56.403
WE'LL HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE A

03:36:56.470 --> 03:36:57.637
LITTLE MORE UNDERSTANDING ABOUT

03:36:57.704 --> 03:36:58.505
WHY THE PLUSES AND TINGS GET A

03:36:58.572 --> 03:37:00.307
LITTLE DELAYED.

03:37:00.374 --> 03:37:00.874
IF IT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE ON

03:37:00.941 --> 03:37:02.609
THEIR TERMS I THINK YOU ALL FOR

03:37:02.676 --> 03:37:03.910
STICKING AROUND.

JUST LETTING EVERYBODY KNOW WHAT

IT MEANS THAT THE BILL SUNSETS

03:37:18.258 --> 03:37:19.359
BECAUSE THERE THAT I DON'T.

03:37:19.426 --> 03:37:20.794
