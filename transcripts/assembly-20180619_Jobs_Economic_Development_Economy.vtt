THE OX EIGHTEEN CREASES ACCESS

00:45:32.663 --> 00:45:39.570 region:rollup2

00:45:34.332 --> 00:45:41.839 region:rollup2
OUT OF EVERY BUSINESS THAT --

00:45:39.570 --> 00:45:43.107 region:rollup2

WE WANT TO GET SMALL BUSINESS TO

00:46:00.057 --> 00:46:02.560 region:rollup2

00:46:15.473 --> 00:46:18.509 region:rollup2
WOULD.

00:46:17.308 --> 00:46:20.177 region:rollup2

IMPORTANT VALUES.

00:56:33.156 --> 00:56:35.525 region:rollup2
SO WHAT DOES THIS LOOK LIKE AND

00:56:34.258 --> 00:56:36.960 region:rollup2
CAL CAP.

00:56:35.525 --> 00:56:38.695 region:rollup2
IT MEANS THAT OUR ANALYSTS HAVE

ACQUISITIONS.

00:56:58.649 --> 00:57:01.485 region:rollup2
IT MEANS THAT THE STAFF IS

OF THE PROGRAM.

00:57:15.766 --> 00:57:18.669 region:rollup2
IT MEANS MAINTAINING THE

00:57:17.067 --> 00:57:21.004 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS OF THE

00:57:18.669 --> 00:57:23.006 region:rollup2

00:57:27.444 --> 00:57:31.415 region:rollup2
IT ALSO MEANS WALKING A DELICATE

THE CAL CAP PROGRAM TO FLOURISH

00:57:35.419 --> 00:57:38.422 region:rollup2
WHILE KEEPING WATCH TO ENSURE

00:57:37.287 --> 00:57:39.923 region:rollup2
THAT THE PROGRAM DOESN'T

00:57:38.422 --> 00:57:42.426 region:rollup2
UNINTENTIONALLY INCUBATE A

00:57:39.923 --> 00:57:43.794 region:rollup2
PORTFOLIO OF TROUBLED ASSETS.

00:57:42.426 --> 00:57:45.896 region:rollup2

00:57:57.140 --> 00:58:00.444 region:rollup2
SO ADMITTEDLY MUCH OF THE REASON

00:57:58.675 --> 00:58:02.145 region:rollup2
WHY I THINK WE ARE HERE IS DUE

MECHANISM AS WELL.

01:00:18.482 --> 01:00:21.318 region:rollup2
SO THE CAL CAP FOR SMALL

01:00:21.318 --> 01:00:25.388 region:rollup2

LENDING IS IN INDUSTRY WE SEE

01:01:57.881 --> 01:02:02.285 region:rollup2

01:02:02.285 --> 01:02:05.422 region:rollup2

PREDATORY BUSINESS LENDING.

01:02:12.262 --> 01:02:15.732 region:rollup2
WALL AT THE SAME TIME SUPPORTING

01:02:13.997 --> 01:02:16.633 region:rollup2

UNDERSERVED BUSINESSES.

01:02:20.136 --> 01:02:24.140 region:rollup2
AND SO IN THAT TMOSPHERE WE

01:02:22.439 --> 01:02:26.009 region:rollup2
APPRECIATE THAT ANY PROGRAM

01:02:24.140 --> 01:02:27.877 region:rollup2

SERVICE AND PRUDENT OVERSIGHT.

01:02:36.953 --> 01:02:39.656 region:rollup2
AND WE ALSO APPRECIATE THAT

01:02:38.421 --> 01:02:41.691 region:rollup2
WHILE SOME LENDERS MAY WANT

01:02:39.656 --> 01:02:42.559 region:rollup2
INCREASED FLEXIBILITY OR NEW

01:02:41.691 --> 01:02:43.126 region:rollup2
TOOLS TO MEET THE CHANGING

01:02:42.559 --> 01:02:44.027 region:rollup2

01:02:55.171 --> 01:02:58.074 region:rollup2
NOTABLE THAT LENDER CONFIDENCE

DOES REMAIN STRONGER THAN EVER

01:02:58.074 --> 01:03:01.177 region:rollup2
AS EVIDENCED BY THE FACT THAT

01:02:59.709 --> 01:03:04.514 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW LOAN ENROLLMENT VOLUME

01:03:01.177 --> 01:03:05.615 region:rollup2

SO ADMITTEDLY IN ADDRESSING YOU

01:03:05.615 --> 01:03:08.518 region:rollup2
THIS MORNING TRYING TO FIND OUT

01:03:07.317 --> 01:03:09.552 region:rollup2
THE REAL REASON FOR MOVING THE

01:03:08.518 --> 01:03:11.488 region:rollup2
PROGRAM.

01:03:09.552 --> 01:03:12.856 region:rollup2
WHICH IS SUCCESSFUL BY EVERY

01:03:11.488 --> 01:03:14.491 region:rollup2
MEASURE AWAY FROM THE

01:03:12.856 --> 01:03:15.725 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION THAT GAVE BIRTH

01:03:14.491 --> 01:03:16.726 region:rollup2
TO IT AND RAISED IT.

01:03:15.725 --> 01:03:18.528 region:rollup2
HAS FELT A LITTLE BIT LIKE

01:03:16.726 --> 01:03:20.864 region:rollup2
PUNCHING A PILLOW THE RATIONALE

01:03:18.528 --> 01:03:21.431 region:rollup2

CONVERSATION AND FROM DAY TO

01:03:21.431 --> 01:03:23.800 region:rollup2
DAY.

01:03:22.599 --> 01:03:25.468 region:rollup2
SO WITH THAT I WOULD DO REMAIN

THEY'VE INDICATED TO US THAT

THEY ARE ALSO OPPOSED TO THE

01:03:51.795 --> 01:03:53.963 region:rollup2

01:03:58.702 --> 01:04:02.939 region:rollup2
A LITTLE BIT TO INTIMATELY HOW

01:04:01.104 --> 01:04:03.606 region:rollup2
HOW THE PROGRAM WORKS --

01:04:02.939 --> 01:04:04.507 region:rollup2
WE'VE RD SHARE WITH COMMITTEE I

01:04:03.606 --> 01:04:05.875 region:rollup2
THINK A TREMENDOUS SUCCESSES

01:04:04.507 --> 01:04:07.544 region:rollup2
THAT -- THAT

01:04:05.875 --> 01:04:08.878 region:rollup2
WE'VE WITNESSED OVER TWENTY FIVE

01:04:07.544 --> 01:04:10.380 region:rollup2
YEARS OF THE PROGRAM --

01:04:08.878 --> 01:04:13.016 region:rollup2
IN FACT SINCE THAT TREASURE TOOK

01:04:10.380 --> 01:04:14.250 region:rollup2
OFFICE IN NINETEEN IN TWENTY

01:04:13.016 --> 01:04:16.186 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN WE SEEN A METEORIC RISE

01:04:14.250 --> 01:04:17.020 region:rollup2
IN THE NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS

01:04:16.186 --> 01:04:18.221 region:rollup2
THE NUMBER OF BUSINESSES THAT

01:04:17.020 --> 01:04:18.755 region:rollup2
ARE SIR.

01:04:18.221 --> 01:04:20.457 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT WAS SOMEWHAT

01:04:18.755 --> 01:04:21.691 region:rollup2
EVIDENT IN THE INFORMATION THAT

01:04:20.457 --> 01:04:23.159 region:rollup2
YOU RECEIVE FROM THE PROPONENTS.

01:04:21.691 --> 01:04:24.828 region:rollup2
OF THAT FACT IS CONTINUE TO BE

01:04:23.159 --> 01:04:25.895 region:rollup2
SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM THE QUESTION

01:04:24.828 --> 01:04:28.131 region:rollup2
WHETHER THAT CONTINUES TO BE THE

01:04:25.895 --> 01:04:29.399 region:rollup2
CASE BUT AS RENEE JUST SAID IN

01:04:28.131 --> 01:04:30.633 region:rollup2
THE LAST YEAR WE'VE ACTUALLY

01:04:29.399 --> 01:04:32.535 region:rollup2
SEEN AN INCREASE.

01:04:30.633 --> 01:04:33.703 region:rollup2
IN THE NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS SO

01:04:32.535 --> 01:04:35.171 region:rollup2
YOU'RE BASICALLY LOOK AT A

01:04:33.703 --> 01:04:36.439 region:rollup2
PROGRAM THAT NOT ONLY SUCCESSFUL

01:04:35.171 --> 01:04:38.174 region:rollup2
IN DOING OUTREACH.

01:04:36.439 --> 01:04:39.542 region:rollup2
BUT IN PARTICULAR DOING OUTREACH

01:04:38.174 --> 01:04:41.211 region:rollup2
TO LEVERAGE PRIVATE DOLLARS WHEN

01:04:39.542 --> 01:04:43.713 region:rollup2
WE ENTERED OFFICE.

01:04:41.211 --> 01:04:45.148 region:rollup2
THE A LEVERAGE RATIO IS.

01:04:43.713 --> 01:04:46.182 region:rollup2
SIX ONE IT'S NOW 1-821- THAT

01:04:45.148 --> 01:04:48.118 region:rollup2
MEANS FOR EVERY DOLLAR THAT WE

01:04:46.182 --> 01:04:48.685 region:rollup2
PUT IN A LOAN LOSS RESERVE.

01:04:48.118 --> 01:04:50.620 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN DOLLARS OF PRIVATE

01:04:48.685 --> 01:04:52.188 region:rollup2
ACTIVITY ARE TAKING PLACE OUT IN

01:04:50.620 --> 01:04:52.722 region:rollup2
THE CALIFORNIA BUSINESS

01:04:52.188 --> 01:04:53.857 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENT I THINK THAT'S

01:04:52.722 --> 01:04:55.358 region:rollup2
PRETTY INCREDIBLE.

01:04:53.857 --> 01:04:57.427 region:rollup2
UP I SHOULD ALSO MENTION THAT WE

01:04:55.358 --> 01:04:58.061 region:rollup2
HAVE A VERY EXTENSIVE OUTREACH

01:04:57.427 --> 01:04:59.429 region:rollup2
TO THOSE WHO HAVE TRADITIONALLY

01:04:58.061 --> 01:05:00.797 region:rollup2
BEEN UNDER SIR.

01:04:59.429 --> 01:05:02.465 region:rollup2
AND THAT INCLUDES BOTH THE IN

01:05:00.797 --> 01:05:04.401 region:rollup2
AND MINORITY COMMUNITIES THAT WE

01:05:02.465 --> 01:05:04.901 region:rollup2
NEED TO HAVE TRADITIONALLY HAD A

01:05:04.401 --> 01:05:06.202 region:rollup2
HARD TIME WITH ACCESS TO

THAT IF YOU'RE GOING TO RUN A

01:05:59.622 --> 01:06:01.991 region:rollup2

THIS BILL TO BASICALLY PAD THEIR

01:06:07.630 --> 01:06:10.400 region:rollup2
THEIR ASSET SHEETS THAT'S JUST

01:06:09.098 --> 01:06:11.301 region:rollup2
NOT WHAT THE PROGRAM WAS

01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:12.335 region:rollup2
INTENDED TO DO.

01:06:11.301 --> 01:06:13.503 region:rollup2

01:06:12.335 --> 01:06:15.071 region:rollup2
BUSINESS.

01:06:13.503 --> 01:06:16.673 region:rollup2
SO I IMPLORE YOU TO THINK ABOUT

01:06:15.071 --> 01:06:17.774 region:rollup2
THAT THAT IN FACT THAT'S THE

01:06:16.673 --> 01:06:18.141 region:rollup2
WHOLE PURPOSE FOR WHY WE'RE HERE

01:06:17.774 --> 01:06:20.410 region:rollup2

FOR IT WE WANT TO BE SUPPORTIVE

THAT WE SHOULD ALLOW A LOT OF

01:06:30.053 --> 01:06:32.021 region:rollup2
OTHER PEOPLE TO GO AND PICK

01:06:30.620 --> 01:06:33.122 region:rollup2

01:10:13.910 --> 01:10:17.880 region:rollup2
ACROSS THE STATE. ONE OF THE ONE

01:10:16.646 --> 01:10:19.449 region:rollup2
OF THE CRITICISMS THAT HAS HAS

01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:20.616 region:rollup2
COME OUT OF THIS I'VE BEEN

01:10:19.449 --> 01:10:22.118 region:rollup2
INVOLVED IN THIS I THINK THERE'S

01:10:20.616 --> 01:10:24.187 region:rollup2
A LOT OF STAKEHOLDERS.

01:10:22.118 --> 01:10:25.488 region:rollup2
THE UN IT ON EVEN.

01:10:24.187 --> 01:10:27.490 region:rollup2
ALLOCATION OF FUNDS ACROSS THE

01:10:25.488 --> 01:10:28.758 region:rollup2
STATE OF CO CAP.

01:10:27.490 --> 01:10:29.292 region:rollup2
CAL KEPT WHICH WILL WAS SUPPOSED

01:10:28.758 --> 01:10:30.693 region:rollup2
TO REACH EVERY PART OF THE

01:10:29.292 --> 01:10:33.062 region:rollup2
STATE.

01:10:30.693 --> 01:10:35.264 region:rollup2
AND I'M VERY CRITICAL AT HOW --

01:10:33.062 --> 01:10:36.733 region:rollup2
THOSE FUNDS WERE ALLOCATED TO

01:10:35.264 --> 01:10:39.135 region:rollup2
BUSINESSES THEY WERE.

01:10:36.733 --> 01:10:42.638 region:rollup2
THERE THEIR ENORMOUS --

01:10:39.135 --> 01:10:44.574 region:rollup2
EMPTIED A AREAS OR DEATH OR OR

01:10:42.638 --> 01:10:45.074 region:rollup2
OR FINANCE DESERT'S ACROSS THE

01:10:44.574 --> 01:10:46.309 region:rollup2
STATE ONE OF THEM IS MY

01:10:45.074 --> 01:10:48.978 region:rollup2
DISTRICT.

01:10:46.309 --> 01:10:51.114 region:rollup2
CAL CAP --

01:10:48.978 --> 01:10:53.082 region:rollup2
HAD ZERO TO KNOW A LOANS IN MY

01:10:51.114 --> 01:10:54.851 region:rollup2
DISTRICT AND AND I ACTUALLY

01:10:53.082 --> 01:10:55.985 region:rollup2
WORKED VERY HARD TO WORK WITH

01:10:54.851 --> 01:10:56.719 region:rollup2
THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY IN MY

01:10:55.985 --> 01:10:58.421 region:rollup2
DISTRICT.

01:10:56.719 --> 01:11:00.123 region:rollup2
THE LENDERS IN MY DISTRICT THE

01:10:58.421 --> 01:11:02.024 region:rollup2
MEDIA IN MY DISTRICT TO GET THIS

01:11:00.123 --> 01:11:04.026 region:rollup2
PROGRAM --

01:11:02.024 --> 01:11:06.162 region:rollup2
PROMOTED AND YET NO LOW LOANS

01:11:04.026 --> 01:11:08.598 region:rollup2
WERE MADE AND BUT I THINK THAT

01:11:06.162 --> 01:11:11.067 region:rollup2
THAT YOU KNOW.

01:11:08.598 --> 01:11:12.368 region:rollup2
LOOK THE THE I AM NOT I'M NOT

01:11:11.067 --> 01:11:13.369 region:rollup2
HERE TO DISPARAGE ANYBODY I'M

01:11:12.368 --> 01:11:14.770 region:rollup2
JUST SAYING AS A LEGISLATURE WE

01:11:13.369 --> 01:11:16.539 region:rollup2
CAN.

01:11:14.770 --> 01:11:17.440 region:rollup2
WE WE CAN --

01:11:16.539 --> 01:11:19.075 region:rollup2
WORK WITH OUR STATE LIFT

01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:20.743 region:rollup2
STAKEHOLDERS AND COMMUNITY IN

01:11:19.075 --> 01:11:22.712 region:rollup2
THE PEOPLE THAT ARE EXPERTS IN.

01:11:20.743 --> 01:11:23.446 region:rollup2
IN AND WANTED PARTICIPANTS

01:11:22.712 --> 01:11:26.983 region:rollup2
PROGRAM I HAD A HARD TIME

01:11:23.446 --> 01:11:28.518 region:rollup2
GETTING LENDERS IN MY COMMUNITY.

01:11:26.983 --> 01:11:29.919 region:rollup2
TO A PARTICIPANT PROGRAM A LOT

01:11:28.518 --> 01:11:30.620 region:rollup2
OFTHEM HAD NOT EVEN HEARD OF IT

01:11:29.919 --> 01:11:35.158 region:rollup2
AND I UNDERSTAND.

01:11:30.620 --> 01:11:36.926 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THE THEY CP.

01:11:35.158 --> 01:11:38.895 region:rollup2
THE CBC FAA.

01:11:36.926 --> 01:11:40.663 region:rollup2
HAS BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL AND IN

01:11:38.895 --> 01:11:41.998 region:rollup2
CERTAIN AREAS AND THEY HAVE AND

01:11:40.663 --> 01:11:43.032 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE A GREAT STAFF AND THEY

01:11:41.998 --> 01:11:44.167 region:rollup2
HAVE DONE A GREAT JOB

01:11:43.032 --> 01:11:45.968 region:rollup2
ADMINISTERING THE PROGRAM BUT IT

01:11:44.167 --> 01:11:47.503 region:rollup2
CAN BE DONE BETTER.

01:11:45.968 --> 01:11:49.639 region:rollup2
AND IT CAN BE PUT IN WITH AN

01:11:47.503 --> 01:11:52.275 region:rollup2
APARTMENT THAT IS FOCUSED.

01:11:49.639 --> 01:11:53.876 region:rollup2
ON PROVIDING THE SERVICES --

01:11:52.275 --> 01:11:55.811 region:rollup2
WITH TWO PEOPLE THAT HAVE

01:11:53.876 --> 01:11:56.979 region:rollup2
CONTACT WITH EVERYDAY.

01:11:55.811 --> 01:11:58.281 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT THAT IS WHAT

01:11:56.979 --> 01:11:59.382 region:rollup2
WE'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH HERE

01:11:58.281 --> 01:12:00.850 region:rollup2
WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE THIS

01:11:59.382 --> 01:12:02.985 region:rollup2
PROGRAM SUSTAINABLE.

01:12:00.850 --> 01:12:04.353 region:rollup2
IT HAS NOT BEEN --

01:12:02.985 --> 01:12:05.488 region:rollup2
IT IN THAT REGARD I MEAN WE HAVE

01:12:04.353 --> 01:12:06.789 region:rollup2
BEEN PUTTING MONEY INTO THIS

01:12:05.488 --> 01:12:08.524 region:rollup2
PROGRAM AND IT SHOULD BE AT

01:12:06.789 --> 01:12:10.359 region:rollup2
THOSE FUNDS SHOULD NOT ONLY

01:12:08.524 --> 01:12:11.861 region:rollup2
REGENERATE BUT GROW.

01:12:10.359 --> 01:12:13.563 region:rollup2
AND THAT IS MY HOPE AND DOING

01:12:11.861 --> 01:12:15.131 region:rollup2
THIS AND AGAIN I'M WORKING WITH

01:12:13.563 --> 01:12:17.266 region:rollup2
A LARGER STAKEHOLDER COMMUNITY

01:12:15.131 --> 01:12:18.234 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND DEPARTMENT SUPPOSED.

01:12:17.266 --> 01:12:20.136 region:rollup2
BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE LARGER

01:12:18.234 --> 01:12:21.437 region:rollup2
STAKEHOLDER COMMUNITY THERE IN

01:12:20.136 --> 01:12:23.039 region:rollup2
SUPPORT IN THIS NOT JUST LENDING

01:12:21.437 --> 01:12:24.774 region:rollup2
INSTITUTIONS.

01:12:23.039 --> 01:12:27.043 region:rollup2
IT'S A CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE IT'S

01:12:24.774 --> 01:12:28.411 region:rollup2
A BUSINESSES THEMSELVES --

01:12:27.043 --> 01:12:30.546 region:rollup2
IT'S IT'S BEEN INCLUDES LENDING

01:12:28.411 --> 01:12:31.948 region:rollup2
INSTITUTIONS WITHOUT THEM WE CAN

01:12:30.546 --> 01:12:33.516 region:rollup2
NOT DIMINISH AKAKA.

01:12:31.948 --> 01:12:35.451 region:rollup2
THEY'RE THE ONES THAT ARE THE

01:12:33.516 --> 01:12:36.719 region:rollup2
THAT HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE IN

01:12:35.451 --> 01:12:38.120 region:rollup2
THE RESOURCES AND THE EXPERTISE

01:12:36.719 --> 01:12:39.322 region:rollup2
TO ISSUE THESE LOANS.

01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:42.325 region:rollup2
WITH THE SUPPORT OF THE STATE OF

01:12:39.322 --> 01:12:43.826 region:rollup2
COURSE BUT THEY ARE OUT THERE IF

01:12:42.325 --> 01:12:45.895 region:rollup2
WE CAN GET THEM TO PARTICIPATE.

01:12:43.826 --> 01:12:47.496 region:rollup2
THIS MONEY WILL NOT FLOW EQUALLY

01:12:45.895 --> 01:12:48.831 region:rollup2
ACROSS THE STATE WHICH IS WHAT

01:12:47.496 --> 01:12:51.167 region:rollup2
WHAT SHOULD BE DONE SHOULD BE

01:12:48.831 --> 01:12:52.134 region:rollup2
EQUITABLE ACCESS FOR ALL PEOPLE

TRYING TO UNDERSTAND IF WE

01:13:03.379 --> 01:13:05.915 region:rollup2
CHANGE IT.

01:13:04.747 --> 01:13:07.183 region:rollup2
DO YOU KNOW FOR TRANSFER TO A

01:13:05.915 --> 01:13:08.951 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT AGENCY WHAT IS THAT

01:13:07.183 --> 01:13:11.487 region:rollup2
AGENCY GONNA DO DIFFERENTLY TO

01:13:08.951 --> 01:13:12.255 region:rollup2
MAINTAIN ITS SUSTAINABILITY --

01:13:11.487 --> 01:13:12.922 region:rollup2
ME SPECIFICALLY IF THEY'RE NO

01:13:12.255 --> 01:13:14.223 region:rollup2
LONGER NEEDED AND IF THEY'RE NO

01:13:12.922 --> 01:13:15.491 region:rollup2
LONGER GOING TO BE UTILIZING

01:13:14.223 --> 01:13:16.692 region:rollup2
RECAPTURE POLICY.

01:13:15.491 --> 01:13:17.994 region:rollup2
WHAT?

01:13:16.692 --> 01:13:23.833 region:rollup2
WHAT'S THE PLAN AND HOW YOU KNOW

01:13:17.994 --> 01:13:26.402 region:rollup2
BY.

01:13:23.833 --> 01:13:27.436 region:rollup2
I COULD SPEAK TO THAT AS A BAKER

01:13:26.402 --> 01:13:30.006 region:rollup2
EAT DO YOU LIKE WHAT I'M TRYING

01:13:27.436 --> 01:13:31.774 region:rollup2
TO MIKE UP A LITTLE CLOSE LIKE

01:13:30.006 --> 01:13:34.143 region:rollup2
THAT SHE'S MAD AT ME TO BUT IT.

01:13:31.774 --> 01:13:35.244 region:rollup2
A RECAPTURE SEEMS TO BE THE BIG

01:13:34.143 --> 01:13:37.813 region:rollup2
ISSUE HERE AND OBVIOUSLY

01:13:35.244 --> 01:13:39.482 region:rollup2
SUSTAINABILITY OF THE PROGRAM.

01:13:37.813 --> 01:13:40.983 region:rollup2
I HAPPEN TO KNOW THAT THE PEOPLE

01:13:39.482 --> 01:13:42.318 region:rollup2
THAT I BANKER BANKERS I THINK

01:13:40.983 --> 01:13:43.452 region:rollup2
LIKE BANKERS THEY UNDERSTAND

01:13:42.318 --> 01:13:44.887 region:rollup2
ECONOMICS THEN UNDERSTAND

01:13:43.452 --> 01:13:46.756 region:rollup2
FORECASTING.

01:13:44.887 --> 01:13:48.925 region:rollup2
THEY UNDERSTAND RESERVES THEY

01:13:46.756 --> 01:13:50.793 region:rollup2
ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT THE LOSSES

01:13:48.925 --> 01:13:51.894 region:rollup2
THAT BANKS TAKEN THE PORTFOLIOS.

01:13:50.793 --> 01:13:53.162 region:rollup2
FOR THE PAST EIGHT YEARS ON A

01:13:51.894 --> 01:13:54.430 region:rollup2
REALLY NOTHING COMPARED TO WHAT

01:13:53.162 --> 01:13:55.531 region:rollup2
THEY COULD BE IN A DOWN CYCLE

01:13:54.430 --> 01:13:57.266 region:rollup2
JUST TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT

01:13:55.531 --> 01:13:58.901 region:rollup2
HAPPENED AFTER TWO THOUSAND AND

01:13:57.266 --> 01:14:00.403 region:rollup2
EIGHT SO THAT THE ARBITRARY.

01:13:58.901 --> 01:14:02.571 region:rollup2
LEVEL OF RESERVES THAT WAS

01:14:00.403 --> 01:14:05.207 region:rollup2
DICTATED WITH THE RECENT

01:14:02.571 --> 01:14:07.243 region:rollup2
LEGISLATION --

01:14:05.207 --> 01:14:08.778 region:rollup2
WAS THAT IT JUST SET ARBITRARY

01:14:07.243 --> 01:14:10.479 region:rollup2
THAT PICKED A NUMBER 10% SHOULD

01:14:08.778 --> 01:14:11.047 region:rollup2
BE ALL YOU NEED.

01:14:10.479 --> 01:14:13.549 region:rollup2
WELL WHEN YOU'RE MAKING LOS

01:14:11.047 --> 01:14:15.318 region:rollup2
TOMORROW TO MARGINAL BORROWERS

01:14:13.549 --> 01:14:18.154 region:rollup2
YOU TO BE READY FOR THAT DOWN

01:14:15.318 --> 01:14:19.722 region:rollup2
CYCLONE ECONOMY HAS A BANK.

01:14:18.154 --> 01:14:20.990 region:rollup2
I HAVE TO PROVE TO MY REGULATORS

01:14:19.722 --> 01:14:22.692 region:rollup2
THAT I'M READY FOR THAT THAT

01:14:20.990 --> 01:14:25.628 region:rollup2
I'VE FACTORED IN FACT THERE'S A

01:14:22.692 --> 01:14:27.963 region:rollup2
WHOLE NEW --

01:14:25.628 --> 01:14:29.231 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTING INDUSTRY STANDARD FOR

01:14:27.963 --> 01:14:30.800 region:rollup2
THE BANKS TO CALCULATE THE

01:14:29.231 --> 01:14:31.400 region:rollup2
RESERVES NOT BASED ON THE OLD

01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:32.968 region:rollup2
WAY.

01:14:31.400 --> 01:14:34.036 region:rollup2
BASED ON LIFE OF THE LOAN

01:14:32.968 --> 01:14:35.604 region:rollup2
INCLUDING THE LIKELIHOOD OF A

01:14:34.036 --> 01:14:37.540 region:rollup2
DOWN ECONOMY.

01:14:35.604 --> 01:14:39.742 region:rollup2
SO I CANNOT SAY CATEGORICALLY

01:14:37.540 --> 01:14:42.345 region:rollup2
THAT THE ARBITRARY 10% LEVEL OF

01:14:39.742 --> 01:14:44.480 region:rollup2
RESERVES THAT WAS STATED TO BE

01:14:42.345 --> 01:14:46.215 region:rollup2
OF OF APPROPRIATE INSUFFICIENT

01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:49.018 region:rollup2
IN THIS LEGISLATION.

01:14:46.215 --> 01:14:50.219 region:rollup2
IS IN FACT A GOOD NUMBER NUMBER.

01:14:49.018 --> 01:14:51.253 region:rollup2
ONE SO WHEN YOU SAY WELL WHAT

01:14:50.219 --> 01:14:52.521 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO BE

01:14:51.253 --> 01:14:53.856 region:rollup2
BETTER AT IBEC I JUST THINK THAT

01:14:52.521 --> 01:14:55.758 region:rollup2
THEY'RE BANKERS THEY UNDERSTAND

01:14:53.856 --> 01:14:56.892 region:rollup2
THE BIG PICTURE OF WHAT LENDERS

01:14:55.758 --> 01:15:00.129 region:rollup2
ARE UP AGAINST.

01:14:56.892 --> 01:15:01.297 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF WHAT'S YOU KNOW

01:15:00.129 --> 01:15:02.565 region:rollup2
WHAT'S A WRITER'S RESERVE MAN

01:15:01.297 --> 01:15:03.799 region:rollup2
HOW DO YOU GET THERE I'LL TELL

01:15:02.565 --> 01:15:05.234 region:rollup2
YOU WHAT I DID.

01:15:03.799 --> 01:15:06.502 region:rollup2
AT MY BANK AND I THINK I'M

01:15:05.234 --> 01:15:08.037 region:rollup2
PRETTY MUCH THE TARGET OF THE

01:15:06.502 --> 01:15:09.538 region:rollup2
STATEMENT.

01:15:08.037 --> 01:15:11.440 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE VITAL RESERVES THAT

01:15:09.538 --> 01:15:12.007 region:rollup2
WERE JUST HOLDING ON TO THEY

01:15:11.440 --> 01:15:14.477 region:rollup2
DON'T SHOW UP ON OUR BALANCE

01:15:12.007 --> 01:15:16.078 region:rollup2
SHEET.

01:15:14.477 --> 01:15:17.780 region:rollup2
I CREATED THE IDLE RESERVES BY

01:15:16.078 --> 01:15:19.815 region:rollup2
DOING PRUDENT LENDING NOT TAKING

01:15:17.780 --> 01:15:21.684 region:rollup2
LOSSES DURING A LOT OF LOANS.

01:15:19.815 --> 01:15:23.085 region:rollup2
AND I DID IT BECAUSE I WANTED TO

01:15:21.684 --> 01:15:24.854 region:rollup2
HAVE A I KNEW THEIR AGENCY WAS

01:15:23.085 --> 01:15:26.689 region:rollup2
RUNNING OUT OF FUNDS EIGHT YEARS

01:15:24.854 --> 01:15:28.357 region:rollup2
AGO EVERYBODY KNEW.

01:15:26.689 --> 01:15:29.392 region:rollup2
THE FUNDS WERE GOING TO RUN OUT.

01:15:28.357 --> 01:15:31.127 region:rollup2
THEN THIS S. B. C. I'M WHEN HE

01:15:29.392 --> 01:15:32.161 region:rollup2
SHOWED UP.

01:15:31.127 --> 01:15:33.529 region:rollup2
WE SAID WE STILL KNEW THAT IT

01:15:32.161 --> 01:15:38.000 region:rollup2
WOULD RUN OUT IN APRIL OF LAST

01:15:33.529 --> 01:15:39.668 region:rollup2
YEAR BUT YOU KNOW WE KNEW WAS

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:41.604 region:rollup2
COMING WE ALSO KNEW THE SIXTY

01:15:39.668 --> 01:15:43.205 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLARS HAD TO BE SPENT.

01:15:41.604 --> 01:15:44.907 region:rollup2
OR THEY WOULD LOSE IT HAVE TO

01:15:43.205 --> 01:15:46.642 region:rollup2
GIVE IT BACK TO THE US TREASURY.

01:15:44.907 --> 01:15:48.043 region:rollup2
SO THEY CREATED A MECHANISM TO

01:15:46.642 --> 01:15:49.345 region:rollup2
GRAB THAT SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS

01:15:48.043 --> 01:15:50.312 region:rollup2
RATHER THAN TO GIVE IT BACK THEY

01:15:49.345 --> 01:15:51.781 region:rollup2
PUT IT IN THE COLLATERAL

01:15:50.312 --> 01:15:53.082 region:rollup2
ENHANCEMENT PROGRAM WHERE IT

01:15:51.781 --> 01:15:54.150 region:rollup2
STILL IS.

01:15:53.082 --> 01:15:55.284 region:rollup2
THAT PROGRAM DOESN'T LEVERAGE

01:15:54.150 --> 01:15:57.386 region:rollup2
FUNDS.

01:15:55.284 --> 01:15:59.588 region:rollup2
ANYWHERE NEAR WHAT THE CAPITAL

01:15:57.386 --> 01:16:00.756 region:rollup2
ACCESS PROGRAM GOES.

01:15:59.588 --> 01:16:01.857 region:rollup2
THE US TREASURY STUDY OF A

01:16:00.756 --> 01:16:03.559 region:rollup2
COUPLE YEARS AGO SAID THE

01:16:01.857 --> 01:16:05.327 region:rollup2
CAPITAL ACCESS PROGRAMS LEVERAGE

01:16:03.559 --> 01:16:06.762 region:rollup2
YOUR PUBLIC FUNDS THE MOST OF

01:16:05.327 --> 01:16:08.230 region:rollup2
ANY PROGRAM AND A BANK LENDER

01:16:06.762 --> 01:16:09.365 region:rollup2
DOES IT PRUDENTLY AND DOESN'T

01:16:08.230 --> 01:16:10.032 region:rollup2
TAKE LOSSES THAT COULD BE

01:16:09.365 --> 01:16:11.767 region:rollup2
PERPETUAL.

01:16:10.032 --> 01:16:13.235 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHAT I INTENDED WHEN I

01:16:11.767 --> 01:16:14.503 region:rollup2
KNEW.

01:16:13.235 --> 01:16:15.905 region:rollup2
THAT THE FUNDS WERE GOING TO RUN

01:16:14.503 --> 01:16:16.872 region:rollup2
OUT A CREATED SURPLUS RESERVES

01:16:15.905 --> 01:16:18.107 region:rollup2
AND I VOLUNTEERED TO THE

01:16:16.872 --> 01:16:20.209 region:rollup2
DIRECTOR THAT WE WOULD BE

01:16:18.107 --> 01:16:21.811 region:rollup2
WILLING TO MAKE LOANS WITH NO

01:16:20.209 --> 01:16:23.779 region:rollup2
CONTRIBUTION TO RESERVES.

01:16:21.811 --> 01:16:26.916 region:rollup2
IF WE WERE ALLOWED TO USE OUR

01:16:23.779 --> 01:16:28.651 region:rollup2
RESERVE POOL THE WAY WE WANTED.

01:16:26.916 --> 01:16:30.619 region:rollup2
TO I HAD MANY CONVERSATIONS FOR

01:16:28.651 --> 01:16:31.487 region:rollup2
TWO YEARS AND EVERYTHING I SAID

01:16:30.619 --> 01:16:32.822 region:rollup2
PRETTY MUCH I COULD NOT COME.

01:16:31.487 --> 01:16:34.423 region:rollup2
A RESPONSE HERE BUT WE

01:16:32.822 --> 01:16:35.891 region:rollup2
APPRECIATE THIS AND I DO WANT TO

01:16:34.423 --> 01:16:39.028 region:rollup2
REMIND EVERYBODY THIS IS DOUBLE

01:16:35.891 --> 01:16:40.529 region:rollup2
REFERRED TO BANKING AND SO WILL

01:16:39.028 --> 01:16:41.997 region:rollup2
HAVE THAT INPUT AS WELL THINK

01:16:40.529 --> 01:16:43.132 region:rollup2
FUTURE WOMAN I I'LL TRY TO BE AS

01:16:41.997 --> 01:16:45.167 region:rollup2
BRIEF AS I CAN'T --

01:16:43.132 --> 01:16:46.402 region:rollup2
LET ME FIRST GO TO THE ISSUE OF

01:16:45.167 --> 01:16:48.737 region:rollup2
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN.

01:16:46.402 --> 01:16:49.405 region:rollup2
BOB YOU HAVE RECOGNIZING GO BACK

01:16:48.737 --> 01:16:50.873 region:rollup2
TO THE FACT THAT THIS IS

01:16:49.405 --> 01:16:51.407 region:rollup2
PUNCTURED.

01:16:50.873 --> 01:16:53.042 region:rollup2
PRIMARILY BY THE LEADING

01:16:51.407 --> 01:16:53.976 region:rollup2
INTRIGUED BY CALIFORNIA BANKERS

01:16:53.042 --> 01:16:55.644 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATION SO THEY WANT TO

01:16:53.976 --> 01:16:56.145 region:rollup2
DICTATE WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN I

01:16:55.644 --> 01:16:57.480 region:rollup2
CAN ASSURE YOU BECAUSE I

01:16:56.145 --> 01:16:58.948 region:rollup2
CHECKED.

01:16:57.480 --> 01:17:00.516 region:rollup2
BUT NO ONE IT AT GOBIZ OR THE

01:16:58.948 --> 01:17:01.183 region:rollup2
AYE BANK HAVE INDICATED ANY

01:17:00.516 --> 01:17:01.884 region:rollup2
INTEREST IN TAKING THIS PROGRAM

01:17:01.183 --> 01:17:03.452 region:rollup2
OVER.

01:17:01.884 --> 01:17:04.420 region:rollup2
SO LET'S BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT

01:17:03.452 --> 01:17:06.722 region:rollup2
THAT YOU'RE GONNA GIVE THEM A

01:17:04.420 --> 01:17:07.189 region:rollup2
PROGRAM FOR WHICH THEY HAVE NOT

01:17:06.722 --> 01:17:08.791 region:rollup2
INDICATED ANY INTEREST

01:17:07.189 --> 01:17:10.726 region:rollup2
[inaudible] TO ASSUME.

01:17:08.791 --> 01:17:11.727 region:rollup2
I'M TO GOAD SO WHAT WILL HAPPEN

01:17:10.726 --> 01:17:13.128 region:rollup2
IN THE FUTURE IS MORE THAN

01:17:11.727 --> 01:17:15.197 region:rollup2
LIKELY THEY'RE GOING TO GET

01:17:13.128 --> 01:17:16.632 region:rollup2
HEAVILY LOBBIED. TO DROP TO

01:17:15.197 --> 01:17:18.534 region:rollup2
RECAPTURE PROVISION SO THAN FACT

01:17:16.632 --> 01:17:19.535 region:rollup2
THE LANDERS CAN CONTINUE TO KEEP

01:17:18.534 --> 01:17:21.270 region:rollup2
THAT MONEY IN AND WITH

01:17:19.535 --> 01:17:22.271 region:rollup2
REGARDLESS OF MISREPRESENTATION.

01:17:21.270 --> 01:17:23.739 region:rollup2
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HE WOULD

01:17:22.271 --> 01:17:24.840 region:rollup2
LOVE TO DO IS KEEP THAT MONEY

01:17:23.739 --> 01:17:25.808 region:rollup2
AND BASICALLY HOLD IT FOR

01:17:24.840 --> 01:17:26.842 region:rollup2
HIMSELF EVEN THOUGH HE BE ISN'T

01:17:25.808 --> 01:17:28.144 region:rollup2
USING IT IF HE WANTS TO MAKE NEW

01:17:26.842 --> 01:17:29.311 region:rollup2
LOANS THAT'S GREAT.

01:17:28.144 --> 01:17:31.580 region:rollup2
BUT I'M JUST SAYING WHY WOULD WE

01:17:29.311 --> 01:17:32.381 region:rollup2
OPEN THAT BACK INTO.

01:17:31.580 --> 01:17:33.983 region:rollup2
I MEAN WHICH WE'VE ACTUALLY

01:17:32.381 --> 01:17:35.284 region:rollup2
ADDED TO OUR ROSTER.

01:17:33.983 --> 01:17:36.452 region:rollup2
SINCE WE DON RECAPTURE WE HAVE

01:17:35.284 --> 01:17:38.420 region:rollup2
NEW LENDERS.

01:17:36.452 --> 01:17:39.555 region:rollup2
AND SO AGAIN IT'S I THINK THIS

01:17:38.420 --> 01:17:40.222 region:rollup2
THIS BOILS DOWN TO THIS ONE

01:17:39.555 --> 01:17:41.457 region:rollup2
ISSUE.

01:17:40.222 --> 01:17:43.325 region:rollup2
IS THAT WHERE IS RECAPTURING

01:17:41.457 --> 01:17:44.960 region:rollup2
GOING TO END UP AND WHO'S GOING

01:17:43.325 --> 01:17:45.961 region:rollup2
TO ENFORCE IT AND IF.

01:17:44.960 --> 01:17:47.163 region:rollup2
IF -- AGAIN

01:17:45.961 --> 01:17:48.597 region:rollup2
UP FOR THE LIMITED TIME THAT

01:17:47.163 --> 01:17:50.399 region:rollup2
I'LL BE ON THE AYE BANK WORK I

01:17:48.597 --> 01:17:50.1000 region:rollup2
WOULD CERTAINLY.

01:17:50.399 --> 01:17:52.801 region:rollup2
PUSH THEM IF THEY WERE TO GET

01:17:50.1000 --> 01:17:54.570 region:rollup2
THIS PROGRAM. TO CONTINUE TO

01:17:52.801 --> 01:17:55.905 region:rollup2
HOLD THE LENDERS FEET TO THE

01:17:54.570 --> 01:17:57.339 region:rollup2
FIRE BUT AGAIN THAT'LL BE A

01:17:55.905 --> 01:17:57.940 region:rollup2
DECISION PRIDE WELL BEYOND THE

01:17:57.339 --> 01:17:58.541 region:rollup2
TIME.

01:17:57.940 --> 01:18:01.710 region:rollup2
THAT I'M SERVING ON THE BOARD

01:17:58.541 --> 01:18:03.112 region:rollup2
THE THANK YOU AND UP AS MY

01:18:01.710 --> 01:18:04.180 region:rollup2
MEMBER STEINORTH.

01:18:03.112 --> 01:18:05.748 region:rollup2
YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH --

01:18:04.180 --> 01:18:07.783 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLY MEMBER BERMAN COVERED A

01:18:05.748 --> 01:18:09.018 region:rollup2
LOT OF MY COMMENTS BUT I'M JUST

01:18:07.783 --> 01:18:11.053 region:rollup2
IT'S INTERESTING THAT SMALL

01:18:09.018 --> 01:18:12.321 region:rollup2
BUSINESS DAY AND WE ALL KNOW AS

01:18:11.053 --> 01:18:13.189 region:rollup2
AS SMALL BUSINESS PEOPLE I'VE

01:18:12.321 --> 01:18:14.690 region:rollup2
HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF BEING A

01:18:13.189 --> 01:18:15.591 region:rollup2
SMALL BUSINESSMAN FOR OVER

01:18:14.690 --> 01:18:17.793 region:rollup2
TWENTY YEARS AT THE SINGLE

01:18:15.591 --> 01:18:19.428 region:rollup2
GREATEST PROBLEMS. FOR SMALL

01:18:17.793 --> 01:18:20.462 region:rollup2
BUSINESSES UNDER CAPITALIZATION.

01:18:19.428 --> 01:18:21.797 region:rollup2
JUST POINT LIKE THAT IS THE

01:18:20.462 --> 01:18:23.299 region:rollup2
SINGLE GREATEST REASON FOR

01:18:21.797 --> 01:18:24.567 region:rollup2
BUSINESS TO FAIL YOU CAN HAVE

01:18:23.299 --> 01:18:26.135 region:rollup2
THE BEST PRODUCT HAVE AN

01:18:24.567 --> 01:18:26.735 region:rollup2
ABSOLUTELY OPEN MARKET BUT

01:18:26.135 --> 01:18:28.571 region:rollup2
WITHOUT THE PROPER

01:18:26.735 --> 01:18:29.905 region:rollup2
CAPITALIZATION YOU CANNOT GET

01:18:28.571 --> 01:18:32.241 region:rollup2
YOUR PRODUCT TO MARKET.

01:18:29.905 --> 01:18:33.075 region:rollup2
OR TO THE MEET THE NEEDS OF THE

01:18:32.241 --> 01:18:35.578 region:rollup2
MARKET AND ULTIMATELY YOU WILL

01:18:33.075 --> 01:18:36.645 region:rollup2
FAIL SO MY QUESTION IS IS IT'S

01:18:35.578 --> 01:18:38.347 region:rollup2
IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE I I WAS

01:18:36.645 --> 01:18:39.548 region:rollup2
SERVING A BMP FOR A LONG TIME IN

01:18:38.347 --> 01:18:41.317 region:rollup2
THIS REALLY REMINDS ME A LOT OF

01:18:39.548 --> 01:18:41.984 region:rollup2
US GOT THE PRACTICE ISSUE.

01:18:41.317 --> 01:18:43.652 region:rollup2
WHERE YOU KNOW WE'RE LOOKING AT

01:18:41.984 --> 01:18:44.853 region:rollup2
IT OR KIND OF SCRATCHING HEADS

01:18:43.652 --> 01:18:46.188 region:rollup2
GOING OKAY WHAT WE'VE GOTTA A

01:18:44.853 --> 01:18:47.222 region:rollup2
GOOD AMOUNT OF DOLLARS THAT WE

01:18:46.188 --> 01:18:48.924 region:rollup2
WANT TO MAKE SURE GET TO THE

01:18:47.222 --> 01:18:49.558 region:rollup2
WHITE RIGHT RECIPIENTS AND WE'RE

01:18:48.924 --> 01:18:51.727 region:rollup2
LOOKING WILL WHAT'S THE BEST

01:18:49.558 --> 01:18:54.597 region:rollup2
VEHICLE? TO BRING THOSE DOLLARS

01:18:51.727 --> 01:18:55.598 region:rollup2
TO THOSE RISK SO MY QUESTION

01:18:54.597 --> 01:18:57.433 region:rollup2
WOULD I WOULD LIKE EFFECTIVE

01:18:55.598 --> 01:18:58.567 region:rollup2
INVOLVED ON THE REPRESENT FROM

01:18:57.433 --> 01:18:59.468 region:rollup2
THE BANKERS TO JOIN US AS WELL

01:18:58.567 --> 01:19:00.936 region:rollup2
THE ANSWER --

01:18:59.468 --> 01:19:02.137 region:rollup2
I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO KNOW I

01:19:00.936 --> 01:19:03.339 region:rollup2
MEAN I UNDERSTAND THE RECAPTURE

01:19:02.137 --> 01:19:04.273 region:rollup2
PART THAT IS THAT IS UNIQUE I

01:19:03.339 --> 01:19:05.941 region:rollup2
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERY

01:19:04.273 --> 01:19:07.276 region:rollup2
DOLLAR IS BEING UTILIZED

01:19:05.941 --> 01:19:08.777 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATELY AND IT'S NOT

01:19:07.276 --> 01:19:09.511 region:rollup2
SITTING ON A LEDGER SEEDS SHEET

01:19:08.777 --> 01:19:10.679 region:rollup2
SOMEWHERE.

01:19:09.511 --> 01:19:12.114 region:rollup2
AND LET'S IT'S ON THE SMALL

01:19:10.679 --> 01:19:13.582 region:rollup2
BUSINESS PERSON STE LEDGER SHEET

01:19:12.114 --> 01:19:15.451 region:rollup2
WHERE IT NEEDS TO BE TO BE ABLE

01:19:13.582 --> 01:19:16.752 region:rollup2
TO HELP THEM CREATE JOBS TO

01:19:15.451 --> 01:19:17.586 region:rollup2
MIGRATE QUESTION IS --

01:19:16.752 --> 01:19:19.321 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW JUST A BLANKET

01:19:17.586 --> 01:19:21.023 region:rollup2
STATEMENT WHO WOULD BE THE MOST

01:19:19.321 --> 01:19:22.191 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVE DEPARTMENT TO MAKE

01:19:21.023 --> 01:19:23.926 region:rollup2
SURE THAT THE MOST AMOUNT OF

01:19:22.191 --> 01:19:25.694 region:rollup2
FUNDS ARE DISTRIBUTED TO THE

01:19:23.926 --> 01:19:28.130 region:rollup2
RIGHT PEOPLE IN THE MOST TIMELY

01:19:25.694 --> 01:19:29.565 region:rollup2
MANNER.

01:19:28.130 --> 01:19:30.032 region:rollup2
MAY I RESPOND TO FARMERS

01:19:29.565 --> 01:19:31.233 region:rollup2
THINKING.

01:19:30.032 --> 01:19:32.768 region:rollup2
SO OPPORTUNITY FUND IS A SMALL

01:19:31.233 --> 01:19:34.903 region:rollup2
BUSINESS UNDER WE'VE BEEN AROUND

01:19:32.768 --> 01:19:36.238 region:rollup2
FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS ADMINS AND

01:19:34.903 --> 01:19:37.606 region:rollup2
LET OUT OVER THREE HUNDRED

01:19:36.238 --> 01:19:38.841 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLARS AROUND THE STATE

01:19:37.606 --> 01:19:39.908 region:rollup2
TO TO SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS.

01:19:38.841 --> 01:19:41.910 region:rollup2
AND WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE

01:19:39.908 --> 01:19:43.545 region:rollup2
P. CFA FOR TWO YEARS TO TRY TO

01:19:41.910 --> 01:19:44.013 region:rollup2
RESOLVE THIS ISSUE AND IT IT

01:19:43.545 --> 01:19:44.913 region:rollup2
REALLY GOES FAR BEYOND

01:19:44.013 --> 01:19:47.082 region:rollup2
RECAPTURE.

01:19:44.913 --> 01:19:48.651 region:rollup2
AND FOR EXAMPLE AFTER THE

01:19:47.082 --> 01:19:50.019 region:rollup2
RECAPTURE PROVISIONS AND THEY

01:19:48.651 --> 01:19:51.754 region:rollup2
THEN PASSED REGULATIONS TO

01:19:50.019 --> 01:19:53.088 region:rollup2
CHANGE THE RULES ABOUT HOW WE

01:19:51.754 --> 01:19:54.690 region:rollup2
COULD RESTRUCTURE LOANS AND

01:19:53.088 --> 01:19:56.792 region:rollup2
GREATLY LIMITING.

01:19:54.690 --> 01:19:58.293 region:rollup2
RESTRUCTURING BASICALLY MEANS IF

01:19:56.792 --> 01:19:59.962 region:rollup2
A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER IS HAVING

01:19:58.293 --> 01:20:01.497 region:rollup2
A HARD TIME PAYING BACK ALONE WE

01:19:59.962 --> 01:20:02.665 region:rollup2
CAN GIVE THEM MORE TIME.

01:20:01.497 --> 01:20:04.199 region:rollup2
AND TO PAY BACK BECAUSE THAT'S

01:20:02.665 --> 01:20:05.000 region:rollup2
WHAT WE WANT WE WANT TO GET PAID

01:20:04.199 --> 01:20:06.935 region:rollup2
BACK SO THE BUSINESS OWNER CAN

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.903 region:rollup2
THRIVE AND WE DON'T HAVE TO DIP

01:20:06.935 --> 01:20:09.738 region:rollup2
INTO RESERVES.

01:20:07.903 --> 01:20:11.540 region:rollup2
AND THESE REGULATIONS DESPITE

01:20:09.738 --> 01:20:12.741 region:rollup2
LOTS OF WONDER OPPOSITION REALLY

01:20:11.540 --> 01:20:14.176 region:rollup2
RESTRICTED OUR ABILITY TO

01:20:12.741 --> 01:20:15.411 region:rollup2
RESTRUCTURE OUR LOANS AND SO

01:20:14.176 --> 01:20:16.578 region:rollup2
THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH

01:20:15.411 --> 01:20:18.714 region:rollup2
RECAPTURE --

01:20:16.578 --> 01:20:20.649 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S IT'S AN INDICATION TO

01:20:18.714 --> 01:20:22.384 region:rollup2
ME OF THAT OF THE FACT THAT.

01:20:20.649 --> 01:20:23.052 region:rollup2
I AM I BEING MUCH BETTER

01:20:22.384 --> 01:20:24.553 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDS.

01:20:23.052 --> 01:20:25.721 region:rollup2
AND THE NEEDS OF LENDERS AND

01:20:24.553 --> 01:20:29.291 region:rollup2
THEREFORE SMALL BUSINESS SAYS

01:20:25.721 --> 01:20:29.992 region:rollup2
THAT CP CFA AND IN FACT. TO THAT

01:20:29.291 --> 01:20:31.794 region:rollup2
TO THAT --

01:20:29.992 --> 01:20:33.429 region:rollup2
SUGGESTION THAT AND I THINK

01:20:31.794 --> 01:20:35.531 region:rollup2
ISN'T READY TO TAKE THIS ON A

01:20:33.429 --> 01:20:36.298 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF THE STAFF FROM CP CFA

01:20:35.531 --> 01:20:37.132 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY LAUGHED A NUMBER OF

01:20:36.298 --> 01:20:37.866 region:rollup2
YEARS AGO.

01:20:37.132 --> 01:20:41.837 region:rollup2
AND MOVED OVER THERE SO THE

01:20:37.866 --> 01:20:44.306 region:rollup2
EXPERTISE AND AND LASTLY I WOULD

01:20:41.837 --> 01:20:45.841 region:rollup2
JUST SAY THAT AND A GRAPHIC WITH

01:20:44.306 --> 01:20:46.942 region:rollup2
IT YESTERDAY RELEASED BY HAVE

01:20:45.841 --> 01:20:48.644 region:rollup2
THE TREASURER'S OFFICE KIND OF

01:20:46.942 --> 01:20:49.178 region:rollup2
SHOWING HOW THIS PROGRAM WORKS

01:20:48.644 --> 01:20:50.846 region:rollup2
AND HOW THAT.

01:20:49.178 --> 01:20:52.147 region:rollup2
STATE MONEY COMES AND GOES TO

01:20:50.846 --> 01:20:52.648 region:rollup2
THE SMALL BUSINESS THERE'S A

01:20:52.147 --> 01:20:53.549 region:rollup2
FACT SHEET THE CAME OUT

01:20:52.648 --> 01:20:54.917 region:rollup2
YESTERDAY.

01:20:53.549 --> 01:20:56.685 region:rollup2
AND REALLY INTERESTINGLY IT

01:20:54.917 --> 01:20:58.320 region:rollup2
COMPLETELY IGNORES THE FACT THAT

01:20:56.685 --> 01:20:59.655 region:rollup2
LENDERS ALSO PUT IN THE SAME

01:20:58.320 --> 01:21:00.689 region:rollup2
AMOUNT OF MONEY AT THE STATE THE

01:20:59.655 --> 01:21:01.790 region:rollup2
LENDERS ARE NOWHERE IN THE

01:21:00.689 --> 01:21:03.625 region:rollup2
PICTURE EXCEPT AS RECIPIENTS OF

01:21:01.790 --> 01:21:06.462 region:rollup2
THE FUNDS --

01:21:03.625 --> 01:21:08.731 region:rollup2
AND SO WHAT WE NEED IS AND AN

01:21:06.462 --> 01:21:10.299 region:rollup2
AGENCY THAT UNDERSTANDS LENDING.

01:21:08.731 --> 01:21:11.800 region:rollup2
AND UNDERSTAND THAT WE ARE

01:21:10.299 --> 01:21:14.136 region:rollup2
PARTNERS IN THIS THAT WE ARE NOT

01:21:11.800 --> 01:21:15.471 region:rollup2
I'M LOOKING FOR A HANDOUT RATHER

01:21:14.136 --> 01:21:17.139 region:rollup2
THAN WE CAPTURE WHAT THE BILL

01:21:15.471 --> 01:21:18.173 region:rollup2
ORIGINALLY HAD AND IT WAS

01:21:17.139 --> 01:21:19.541 region:rollup2
SOMETHING WHERE EACH LENDER

01:21:18.173 --> 01:21:20.642 region:rollup2
COULD USE THEIR POOL.

01:21:19.541 --> 01:21:22.010 region:rollup2
IF THERE WAS NO MORE STATE MONEY

01:21:20.642 --> 01:21:23.645 region:rollup2
THEY COULD USE THEIR POOL TO

01:21:22.010 --> 01:21:25.581 region:rollup2
KEEP AND ROLLING AROUND SO WERE

01:21:23.645 --> 01:21:27.015 region:rollup2
ALL FOR USING THAT MONEY TO THE

01:21:25.581 --> 01:21:28.817 region:rollup2
BEST USE POSSIBLE.

01:21:27.015 --> 01:21:30.352 region:rollup2
THE IDEA OF CHANGING THE RULES

01:21:28.817 --> 01:21:31.620 region:rollup2
AFTER THE FACT ON LENDERS AND

01:21:30.352 --> 01:21:33.088 region:rollup2
AND CHANGING THE RULES OF THE

01:21:31.620 --> 01:21:34.690 region:rollup2
GAME IS WHAT I THINK WE ALL ARE

01:21:33.088 --> 01:21:36.225 region:rollup2
QUITE OPPOSED.

01:21:34.690 --> 01:21:38.727 region:rollup2
TO SELLING IN CONCLUSION.

OF THAT PERSON WHO KNOWS. ZERO

01:24:51.787 --> 01:24:57.059 region:rollup2
ABOUT HELP CAP OR A OR B. OR ANY

01:24:54.590 --> 01:24:59.194 region:rollup2
OF THE ACRONYMS THAT WE ALL KNOW

01:24:57.059 --> 01:25:00.629 region:rollup2
AND CAN FIRSTHAND SAY BECAUSE WE

ALL KINDS OF AGENCIES WE CAN

01:25:04.900 --> 01:25:09.004 region:rollup2
SPEAK TO BUT MOST PEOPLE DON'T

01:25:07.369 --> 01:25:09.938 region:rollup2
TO ME WHAT MAKES SENSE ABOUT

01:25:09.004 --> 01:25:11.306 region:rollup2
THIS IS YES WE HAVE THE

01:25:09.938 --> 01:25:13.475 region:rollup2
RECAPTURE ISSUE WE HAVE OTHER

01:25:11.306 --> 01:25:15.043 region:rollup2
ISSUES THAT WILL BE REFERRED. TO

01:25:13.475 --> 01:25:17.379 region:rollup2
BANKING BUT THE BIGGEST THING IS

01:25:15.043 --> 01:25:18.914 region:rollup2
HOW DOES THE AVERAGE PERSON WHO

01:25:17.379 --> 01:25:20.682 region:rollup2
DOESN'T HAVE ANY BAY --

01:25:18.914 --> 01:25:23.418 region:rollup2
ANY BACKGROUND AND JUST WANTS TO

01:25:20.682 --> 01:25:24.753 region:rollup2
START WEARS WHAT ARE THEY GOING

01:25:23.418 --> 01:25:26.054 region:rollup2
TO THINK WHEN THEY'RE WANTING TO

01:25:24.753 --> 01:25:27.089 region:rollup2
START A BUSINESS DO I GO TO THE

01:25:26.054 --> 01:25:29.658 region:rollup2

OF OR DO I GO TO A BILL BIDS AND

01:25:29.658 --> 01:25:33.228 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S REALLY FOR ME WHAT

01:25:31.693 --> 01:25:34.863 region:rollup2
DRIVES ME TO SUPPORT THIS

01:25:33.228 --> 01:25:35.998 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I WANT PEOPLE TO GET THE

01:25:34.863 --> 01:25:37.899 region:rollup2
ACCESS.

01:25:35.998 --> 01:25:40.469 region:rollup2
THAT WE KNOW THEY NEED AND I

01:25:37.899 --> 01:25:41.637 region:rollup2
WANT THEM TO BE ABLE TO START

01:25:40.469 --> 01:25:43.705 region:rollup2
THAT --

01:25:41.637 --> 01:25:44.973 region:rollup2
DREAM THAT THEY HAVE I KNOW THAT

01:25:43.705 --> 01:25:47.009 region:rollup2
THERE'S A LOT OF OTHER ISSUES

01:25:44.973 --> 01:25:49.444 region:rollup2
EMBEDDED AND I CERTAINLY DO NOT

01:25:47.009 --> 01:25:51.713 region:rollup2
WANT THE TREASURER'S OFFICE --

01:25:49.444 --> 01:25:53.048 region:rollup2
