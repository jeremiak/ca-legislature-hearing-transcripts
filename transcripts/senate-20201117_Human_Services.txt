TWO POINT NINE MILLION HOUSEHOLDS WITH ONE POINT TWO MILLION OF THOSE HOUSEHOLDS HAVING CHILDREN AND THEM. WILL BE FOOD INSECURE NEXT WEEK. I WANT TO TALK TO TAKE A QUICK MOMENT AND THINK ABOUT THAT. TWO POINT NINE MILLION HOUSEHOLDS. AS PAINFUL AS PAINFUL AS IT IS FOR ME TO THINK ABOUT THAT IT'S ALSO BEEN A PERSONAL MISSION OF MINE TO USE THAT PAIN AS A WAY TO HEAL. FIVE YEARS AGO I HAD. A BEST FRIEND THAT CAME AND KNOCKED ON MY DOOR. THE END THAT KNOCK FOREVER CHANGED MY LIFE- SHE CAME SHE KNOCKED AND SHE SAID SHE WAS STRUGGLING TO FEED HER INFANT CHILD SHE NEEDED SOME ADDITIONAL FUNDS TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE AND- BABY FOOD FORMULA. IT IT IS THAT THAT IS WHAT LED ME TO RUN FOR CITY COUNCIL INDIVIDUALLY TO STATE SENATE IT FOOD INSECURITY IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY HAS LONG BEEN AN ISSUE. COBEN NINETEEN HAS MADE IT SIGNIFICANTLY WORSE AND THIS IS NOT JUST A STORY THAT IS TRUE TO THE CENTRAL VALLEY MY SENATE DISTRICT. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS CHEAP TOO ALL OF CALIFORNIA AND WITH COLBERT NINETEEN ACROSS THE NATION AS WELL. SO TODAY WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM PEOPLE LIKE MY BEST FRIEND. WHO HAVE FACED CHALLENGES OVER OVER COLBY DURING COAL BED AND EVEN PRIOR TO THAT WE HAVE TO WITNESSES WHOSE HOUSEHOLD NUTRITIONAL NEEDS WERE AFFECTED BY COOPER NINETEEN AND I THINK THEIR STORIES WILL ELIMINATE THE GROWING IMPORTANCE OF FOOD ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS. WE'RE ALSO GOING TO HEAR FROM SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO WORK TO FIGHT HUNGER BE A CALFRESH. OUR FOOD BANKS SENIOR MEAL PROGRAMS AND SCHOOL MEAL PROGRAMS I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO HEARING FROM OUR PANELIST. BEFORE WE BEGIN WITH OUR SCHEDULE SPEAKERS I WOULD LIKE TO. INVITE THE PUBLIC WANTING TO PARTICIPATE CALL IN NOW PLEASE DIAL THIS TOLL FREE EIGHT FOUR FOUR TWO NINE ONE. SIX THREE SIX FOUR WHEN PROMPTED PLEASE USE THE ACCESS CODE. FOR SEVEN FIVE SEVEN ONE THREE FIVE. OUR FIRST PANEL IS GOING TO DISCUSS HOW COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS IMPACTED NEED FOR NUTRITION ASSISTANCE. FOLLOWING THE CONCLUSION OF EACH PANEL I WILL OPEN IT UP TO QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS FROM OUR COMMITTEE MEMBERS. OUR FIRST SPEAKER TODAY IS DIANE WHAT. SHAWLS AND BACH DIRECTOR INSTITUTE FOR POLICY RESEARCH NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY. DIANNE WELCOME AND PLEASE FEEL FREE TO BEGIN WHEN YOU ARE READY. THANK YOU SO MUCH IT'S WONDERFUL TO BE HERE VIRTUALLY WITH YOU ALL TO TALK ABOUT STUDENT SECURITY AND CALIFORNIA I'VE CALCULATED ON NUMBER OF STATISTICS FROM RECENT. THAT WILL HELP US- I THE EXTENT OF FOOD INSECURITY ONE STAR BY SAYING STAGE. BUT STUDENT SECURITY IS A- HIGH INCOME AND NATIONWIDE DURING COLD AT NINETEEN SAID. THERE TO PREVENT OF HARD THAT I PRISON HERE AT THE IS SECURITY WHICH OF THIS MEASUREMENT THAT YOU FAMILY HAVE AN RESOURCE. TO BUY THE FOOD THAT YOU. TO LIVE AN ACTIVE AND HEALTHY LIFE. IT DOESN'T S. INCLUDE ME THAT YOUR HUNGER. I COULD MEAN THAT YOUR YOU'RE HAVING TO REALLY CUT CORNERS YOU KNOW STOP BUYING FRESH FRUITS BUT THAN LIKE THAT THAT'S WAS BROUGHT MEASURE FOOD AND SECURITY. AND WE'RE ALSO IN TO LOOK HUNGER WHICH DURING THE PANDEMIC BEEN MEASURED BY ASKING FAMILIES. DO YOU HAVE ENOUGH TO EAT AND A FAMILY SAYS I WE SOMETIMES ARE OFTEN DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TO EAT. THEY'RE CODED AS- AGAIN HUNGRY. THE JUSTICE OF THE STAGE ON THE EVE OF THE CO PANDA. FOOD AND SECURITY IN OTHER MEASURE OF GOOD HOW. WALKWAY LOW THE TEN PER WELL. ARGUABLY STILL TO BUT A 10% OF CALIFORNIA OVERALL WE'RE- THAT. AND LITTLE LESSON ED. DOES ARE OUR CORE ELEVATED. BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC FROM APRIL TO JULY ALMOST ONE OUT OF FOUR ADULTS IN CALIFORNIA REPORTED THAT THEY WERE FOOD INSECURE AND 11% REPORTED THAT THEY WERE EXPERIENCING ACTUAL HUNGER IN OUR HOUSEHOLDS. THOSE NUMBERS HAVE COME DOWN A LITTLE BIT IN SEPTEMBER AND OCTOBER IS THE ECONOMY STARTED TO REBOUND A LITTLE BAD. AT CETERA. UP TO ABOUT 22% OVERALL AND 10% BOB EXPERIENCING HUNGER. THIS IS WHAT FOOD HARDSHIP IN CALIFORNIA LOOKS LIKE IN SEPTEMBER AND OCTOBER FOR DIFFERENT GROUPS SO WE START WITH THE OVERALL GROUP WHICH I SHOWED YOU ON THE LAST LINE AND WE CAN COME OVER TO FAMILIES ADULTS WITH CHILDREN. YOU CAN SEE THAT ADULTS WITH CHILDREN ARE MORE LIKELY TO EXPERIENCE FOOD HARDSHIP- NEARLY THREE OUT OF TEN ARE REPORTING THREE IN SECURITY 15% ARE REPORTING HUNGER. AMONG THE ELDERLY WHAT THEIR RATES ARE LOWER THEY'RE STILL QUITE ELEVATED 16% OF THE L. OF ELDERLY CALIFORNIANS REPORT THAT THEY'RE FOOD INSECURE. ABOUT 6% SAID THEY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TO EAT. THIS IS WHAT THOSE NUMBERS LOOK LIKE- BY RACE AND ETHNICITY ACROSS CALIFORNIA. YOU CAN SEE WHEN WE THINK ABOUT FOOD SECURITY. ABOUT 15% OF WHITE AND ASIAN RESPONDENTS SAY THAT THEIR FOOD IN SECURE AND THOSE RATES ARE ABOUT DOUBLE. FOR BLACK FAMILIES AND FOR HISPANIC OR LATINO FAMILIES. WHEN WE COME OVER TO THINK ABOUT- ARE YOU SOMETIMES ARE OFTEN NOT GETTING ENOUGH TO EAT. THOSE RATES ARE ABOUT 6% FOR WHITES AND ASIANS AND OUT. MORE THAN MORE THAN TWICE THAT FOR BLACKS AND HISPANICS OR LET'S MEDINA FAMILY. I CAN ALSO SHOW YOU THIS- FOR ADULTS WITH CHILDREN AND YOU CAN SEE IS VERY SIMILAR PATTERNS BUT I'LL JUST POINT HIGHLIGHT ONE NUMBER HERE. ABOUT ONE THIRD OF. THE HISPANIC OR LATINO ADULTS WITH CHILDREN SAID THAT THE FOOD SECURE AND NEARLY ONE OUT OF FIVE SAID THAT THERE'S NOT ENOUGH FOOD TO EAT IN THEIR- AND THEIR HOUSES RIGHT NOW. HERE'S WHAT THE- RESULTS LOOK LIKE FOR ELDERLY ADULTS YOU SEE THAT SAME PATTERN JUST A LITTLE BIT LOWER BUT STILL VERY VERY ELEVATED. JUST FOR CONTEXT- THE RATES IN CALIFORNIA TRACK THE NATIONAL AVERAGE QUITE CLOSELY SO WE'RE SEEING THIS ALL ACROSS THE NATION SOME STATES ARE EXPERIENCING A WORSE SOME STATES ARE DOING A LITTLE BIT BETTER AND CALIFORNIA'S JUST RIGHT AT THAT AVERAGE. IF YOU WANT THINGS TO NOTE THERE IS A STRONG RELIANCE ON FREE MEALS DURING THIS PANDEMIC ABOUT ONE OUT OF EIGHT CALIFORNIANS REPORT RECEIVING A FREE MEAL IN THE PAST WEEK. AND HERE'S WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE FOR THE OVERALL OF FILMS WITH CHILDREN ARE MORE LIKELY ABOUT ONE IN FIVE. SAID THEY GOT A FREE MEAL THE LAST WEEK AND A LITTLE BIT LOWER BOB FOR THE ELDERLY COMMUNITY. AND WHEN WE COMPARE THAT TO THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC IN THE RATES ACTUALLY LOOK QUITE SIMILAR. TO WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS A JUST A TREMENDOUS DEMAND FOR THREE MEALS A TREMENDOUS RELIANCE ON CHARITY FOOD- THAT'S BEEN SUSTAIN FOR QUITE A LONG TIME. JUST SO YOU GET A SENSE OF WHERE THESE THREE MEALS ARE COMING FROM. THE BLUE LINE IT'S THEIR THE BLUE BARS ARE FROM THE SCHOOL AND THE- RED. BURKE FROM UP FROM A FOOD BANK AND THERE ARE OTHER OPTIONS AS WELL THAT THESE ARE SLIPPING TO AND YOU CAN SEE OF COURSE FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN ARE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO SAY THAT THEY'VE GOTTEN A FREE MEAL FROM OF FOOD FROM A SCHOOL. AND OF THE BANK IS BASICALLY PRETTY CONSTANT ACROSS ALL SORTS OF CALIFORNIANS. THIS IS WHAT THOSE NUMBERS LOOK LIKE BY RACE OR ETHNICITY. YOU CAN SEE THAT I'M GONNA GET RID LATINOS IN ADDITION TO EXPERIENCING MORE FOOD AND SECURITY ARE ALSO RELYING MORE ON ON CHARITY SAID. COMING TO A CONCLUSION IS SERVICE QUICKLY AS HE CAN. THIS IS JUST THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG MANY CALIFORNIA FAMILIES ARE YOU. ADDICTING THAT THEY WILL CONTINUE TO- EXPERIENCE HARDSHIP THIS FIRST SET OF BARS IT SAYS- ASKS ARE YOU CONFIDENT THAT YOU'LL BE ABLE TO PAY FOR THE COULD YOU NEED OVER THE NEXT MONTH AND THIS IS THE SHARE OF CALIFORNIANS WHO SAY THAT THEY'RE- EITHER NOT EITHER MODERATELY OR VERY CONFIDENT THAT THEY'LL BE ABLE TO. AFFORD THE FOOD THEY NEED YOU CAN SEE YOU KNOW THOSE NUMBERS ARE YOU KNOW MORE THAN ONE OUT OF THREE OF FOR BLACKS AND HISPANIC OR LATINO ADULTS IN CALIFORNIA. SIMILARLY WE CAN THINK ABOUT THE SHARE OF PEOPLE WHO SAY THAT THEY ARE. NOT CONFIDENT THAT THEY'LL BE ABLE TO PAY THEIR NEXT RENT PAYMENT OR MORTGAGE PAYMENTS THESE ARE VERY VERY HIGH NUMBERS YOU KNOW- ALMOST ONE OUT OF FIVE CALIFORNIANS OVERALL. A SIMILAR. MORE THAN ONE IN TEN CALIFORNIA. FAMILIES REPORT BEING BEHIND CURRENTLY ON THEIR HOUSING PAYMENTS NOT EVEN THINKING ABOUT THE NEXT PAYMENT. RELIEF PAYMENTS HAVE CERTAINLY HELP I KNOW THAT OTHERS WILL BE TALKING MORE ABOUT THIS. CALFRESH RESPONSE HAS BEEN STRONG AS HAS SNAPPED NATIONWIDE. THERE WAS A SHARP INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF FAMILIES. SERVED BY THIS PROGRAM UP 20% BOB BY JUNE IT'S COME DOWN A LITTLE BIT SINCE THEN BUT STILL QUITE ELEVATED. THE PANDEMIC EBT PROGRAM. HAS BEEN SHOWN TO REDUCE. FOOD HARDSHIP FOR FAMILIES THAT RECEIVE THAT IT ALSO BRINGS IN- SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF MONEY TO THE STATE. AND THEN FINALLY I WANT TO SAY IT'S A QUICK THING ABOUT WEST. OF THE PURPLE BARS HERE ARE EIGHT. U. S. WICKS CASELOADS AND THE BLUE BARS OUR CASELOADS IN CALIFORNIA YOU'LL NOTICE THAT. IN RECENT YEARS WHICH CASELOADS HAVE BEEN DECLINING. ALL ACROSS THE NATION WITH THE DECLINING MORE QUICKLY IN CALIFORNIA. SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC THESE NUMBERS HAVE GONE UP WITH PARTICIPATIONS GONE UP IN CALIFORNIA BY ABOUT 11% OF ITS AND MORE RESPONSIVE THAN THE REST OF THE NATION HAS DONE BUT IT'S STILL. YOUR LACK QUITE A BIT COMPARED TO THE NATION AS A WHOLE IN TERMS OF WHAT PARTICIPATION. JUST IF WE CONCLUDE. THIS PANDEMIC AND THOSE SORT OF LONG REACH OF THE RECESSION THAT IT INDUCED ME WITH US FOR A LONG TIME THIS IS- THE FOOD IN START SORRY THIS IS THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE OVER TIME THERE'S A LITTLE A GREEN BAR GREEN LINE HERE AT 6% GENERALLY WE THINK OF ANY TIME THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS ABOVE THIS IS WHAT THE CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE PREDICTS IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE WE KNOW THAT UP LOW EVERITT WORKERS WITH LOW LEVELS OF EDUCATION BLACK WORKERS HISPANIC AND LATINO WORKERS GENERALLY EXPERIENCE HIGHER UNEMPLOYMENT RATES AND THOSE COME DOWN MORE SLOWLY AND SO THAT MEANS THAT THESE FAMILIES ARE GONNA BE IMPACTED BY THE RECESSION. FOR MUCH LONGER. AND THEY'RE GOING TO NEED SUPPORT FOR MUCH LONGER. LOOK FOR THE QUESTIONS THANKS SO MUCH. THANK YOU DIANNE UP NEXT WE HAVE KERRY FIGUEROA CLIENT OF CENTRAL CALIFORNIA FOOD BANK. HI THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. KERRY PLEASE FEEL FREE TO BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY THANK YOU I'M SORRY I JUST WANT TO START BY SAYING- WHEN TWENTY TWENTY STARTED I NEVER THOUGHT THAT FOOD INSECURITY WOULD BE- PART OF MY VOCABULARY- WHEN TWENTY TWENTY STARTED I WAS WORKING FOR CLOSE UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT.

IT BECAME HARDER TO ACQUIRE THE THINGS WE NEED THERE WERE LIMITATIONS ON THE pAMOUNTS OF MILK MEAT AND BREAD THAT WE WERE ABLE TO PURCHASE IN THE STORE- SO IT REALLY. IT REALLY GOT SCARY FOR AWHILE AND I REALLY STARTED TO WORRY IF I WOULD BE ABLE TO ACCESS ENOUGH FOOD FOR MY FAMILY- I NOTICED THAT THE DONATIONS FROM OUR CHURCH WERE COMING FROM THE CENTRAL CALIFORNIA FOOD BANK. SO I REACHED OUT TO THEM AND I ACCESS GROCERIES TO GO THANKS TO GROCERIES TO GO WE WERE ABLE TO RECEIVE FRESH MILK EGGS FRESH FRUITS AND VEGETABLES.

OUR SECOND PANEL. AND OUR NEXT PRESENTER WE HAVE A RYAN ANDERSON FROM THE ALLEY YOU KNOW WHEN HE WILL DISCUSS RECENT STATE AND FEDERAL FUNDING FOR NUTRITION PROGRAMS. YES HELLO. I'M RYAN ANDERSON WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- AND I'M GOING TO BE PRESENTING FROM A HANDOUT THAT WAS INCLUDED IN THE SENATORS BRIEFING MATERIALS AND FOR ANYONE. LISTENING AT HOME IF YOU'D LIKE TO SEE THE HANDOUT IT'S AVAILABLE ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE OF OUR WEBSITE. WHICH IS L. A. O. DOT CA DOT GOV. I'VE BEEN ASKED TO SPEAK VERY BRIEFLY ABOUT THE- A FEDERAL AND STATE PROGRAMS THAT SUPPORT NUTRITION ACCESS. TO HIGHLIGHT SPECIFIC ACTIONS THE STATE HAS TAKEN IN RECENT YEARS TO AUGMENT THOSE PROGRAMS AND ALSO TO INTRODUCE SOME OF THE- POST CODE RELATED NUTRITION ACCESS FOR INSTANCE THE MAIN WHICH YOU'LL HEAR ABOUT IN MORE DEPTH AND THE SUBSEQUENT PANEL. FIRST TO. JUST GIVE A BROAD OVERVIEW OF NUTRITION ACCESS PROGRAMS AND CALIFORNIA. A VARIETY OF THESE PROGRAMS ARE OFFERED THAT SUPPORTED PRIMARILY THROUGH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT- CONTEXT YEARS SAID OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SAYS THIS IS THE WAY OF PROMTING HUMAN WELFARE BUT ALSO AS A WAY OF PROMOTING AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION SO WHILE THESE PROGRAMS ARE ACTUALLY OVERSEEN BY THE U. S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE. THAT INCLUDES OUR TO BROADEST BASED PROGRAMS- EACH SERVING ABOUT FOUR MILLION LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS THOSE WOULD BE CALFRESH WHICH PROVIDES A CASH LIKE BENEFIT. AN ELECTRONIC. EVERY MONTH- THE AVERAGE BENEFITS FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY DOLLARS PER PERSON PER MONTH BUT IT VARIES BASED ON FAMILY SIZE AND INCOME. AND THEN- FREE AND REDUCED PRICE SCHOOL MEALS WHICH REACH. NEARLY FOUR MILLION LOW INCOME- K. TWELVE STUDENTS AS WELL AS SOME AND MARGINALIZED GROUPS SUCH SALAS FOSTER YOUTH OF COURSE MANY STUDENTS BENEFIT FROM BOTH OF THOSE PROGRAMS. THERE'S ALSO A VARIETY OF PROGRAMS SUPPORTING- VIRGIN SIXTY PROVIDERS ON FOOD BANKS THOSE INCLUDE SOMEONE STANDING PROGRAMS LIKE THE EMERGENCY FOOD ACCESS PROGRAMS WELL SOMETIME LIMITED PROGRAMS SUCH AS- TRADE MITIGATION AIN'T. THERE'S ALSO SEVERAL PROGRAMS THAT SUPPORT TARGETED COMMUNITIES SUCH AS THE WOMEN INFANTS AND CHILDREN'S PROGRAMS AND NUTRITION PROGRAMS OFFERED UNDER THE OLDER AMERICANS ACT. OF WHILE MOST OF THESE PROGRAMS ARE PRIMARILY FEDERALLY SUPPORTED THERE ARE SOME STATE ONLY PROGRAMS WHICH INCLUDE LEADING CALIFORNIA FOOD ACCESS PROGRAM WHICH PROVIDES A CALFRESH LIKE BENEFIT. TO ABOUT THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND- CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE INELIGIBLE FOR NORMAL CAL STRESS DUE TO THEIR IMMIGRATION STATUS THESE ARE UNDOCUMENTED INDIVIDUALS THESE ARE LEGAL PERMANENT RESIDENTS WHO HAVE NOT RESIDED IN THE COUNTRY AND- LONG ENOUGH TO QUALIFY FOR CALFRESH- WE ALSO HAVE THESE SUPPLEMENTAL IN THE TRANSITIONAL TRISTIAN BENEFIT PROGRAMS WHICH SERVE ABOUT FIFTY THOUSAND HOUSEHOLDS. AGAIN WITH THE CONFERENCE LIKE BENEFITS THESE ARE HOUSEHOLDS WHICH INCLUDE AT LEAST. ONE INDIVIDUAL WHO IS RECEIVING SUPPLEMENTAL SECURITY INCOME. NOW IN RECENT YEARS THE STATE HAS MADE SEVERAL EFFORTS TO AUGMENT THESE PROGRAMS IMPORTANTLY THIS IS INCLUDED ANY OF THOSE- EFFORTS TO INCREASE CALFRESH PARTICIPATION RATE WHICH- STATE HAS ACCOMPLISHED BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND NINE AND TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THAT RATE INCREASE FROM. 51% 271% BUT ALL THOSE THINGS SUCH AS RE BRANDING THE PROGRAM ELIMINATING ASSET REQUIREMENTS OF PROMOTING NEW WAYS TO. APPLY AND BE. CONFIRMED FOR THAT PROGRAM THOSE CHANGES TOGETHER ABROAD- HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS INTO THE PROGRAM WHO WERE ELIGIBLE. UNDER PREVIOUS REGIMES FOR NOT SIGNING UP. THE STATE ALSO EXPANDED CALIFORNIA SHE TO A NEWLY ELIGIBLE POPULATION THOSE BEING INDIVIDUALS RECEIVING SSI OR S. AS HE PAYMENTS- THIS ATTENDED A PREVIOUS POLICY KNOWN AS THE SSI CASH SHOW. IN THE STATE ACTUALLY DID THIS IN SUCH A WAY THAT EVEN THAT MINORITY OF HOUSEHOLDS WHO MIGHT HAVE BEEN HARMED. UNDER IN THE NATION SSI CASH OUT WHICH PROVIDED SOME ADDITIONAL. FUNDING AND SSI- EVEN THOSE FAMILIES HAVE BEEN HELD HARMLESS THAT WAS THROUGH THE CREATION OF THAT ASIN B. T. N. B. PROGRAM I MENTIONED EARLIER- UNDER THIS CHANGE WHICH WAS MADE JUST A YEAR AGO- OVER FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS HAVE. NEWLY ENROLLED CALFRESH. THE STATE IS ALSO PROVIDED ONGOING AUGMENTATIONS TO A SENIOR NUTRITION PROGRAMS MADE EFFORTS TO. INCREASE THE PURCHASE OF LOCALLY GROWN FOOD ESPECIALLY AMONG LOWER INCOME INDIVIDUALS AND IT'S MADE VARIOUS OTHER DOCUMENTATIONS NUTRITION ACCESS PROGRAMS OVER THE YEARS. MORE RECENTLY AS WAS NOTED BY PREVIOUS SPEAKERS- NUTRITION ACCESS HAS BEEN A BIG CONCERN- IN RESPONSE TO THE PANDEMIC AND THE PUBLIC HEALTH MEASURES FOLLOWING AND- FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS MADE A LOT OF AID AVAILABLE AND THE STATE HAS. HAS MADE EXTRAORDINARY EFFORTS TO UTILIZE MUCH OF THAT AS POSSIBLE MORE PARTICULAR THIRTEEN FROM. IRMA'S SO SERVICES WHICH YOU'LL BE HEARING FROM THE NEXT PANEL THIS IS INCLUDED IN- PANDEMIC EVG THIS WAS A ONE TIME. AND- A LOT OF- ABOUT THREE HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS PER STUDENT THAT WAS DELIVERED TO THREE POINT SEVEN MILLION K. TWELVE STUDENTS THAT WERE AFFECTED BY SCHOOL CLOSURES IN SPRING- THAT HAS SINCE BEEN RE AUTHORIZE FOR. THE FIRST TWO MONTHS OF THE FALL SEMESTER AND THERE ARE CURRENTLY NO PLANS FOR EXTENDED EVENING. THROUGHOUT THE SCHOOL YEAR WELL TOGETHER THAT PROGRAM IS BROUGHT IN SEVERAL MILLION DOLLARS. TO CALIFORNIA FOR NUTRITION ACCESS. THE DEPARTMENT IS ALSO RECEIVED WAIVERS EACH MONTH TO INCREASE CALFRESH BENEFITS TO THEIR MAXIMUM FOR EACH FAMILY SIZE. THIS HAS AGAIN DELIVERED MORE THAN A BILLION DOLLARS IN ADDITIONAL EDUCATION FUNDING FOR LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS- THE STATE ONCE A NEW MAIL DELIVERY SERVICE FOR OLDER ADULTS THE GRADE PLATES. SERVICE AS USUAL STRUCTURE IN THAT IT IS SPECIFICALLY TARGETED TOWARDS INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE NOT ENROLLED IN ANY OTHER NUTRITION PROGRAMS SUCH AS- THOSE OPERATED UNDER THE OLDER AMERICANS ACT- IN ADDITION TO THAT FEDERAL RELIEF BILLS HAVE AUGMENTED. OF FUNDING FOR MOST OF THE MAJOR FEDERAL PROGRAMS OF WOMEN INFANTS AND CHILDREN EMERGENCY FOOD ACCESS PROGRAM OLDER AMERICANS ACT NUTRITION PROGRAMS CALIFORNIA RECEIVES MORE THAN MORE THAN A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AND AUGMENTATIONS- BUT THEY JUST THOSE PROGRAMS. AND THE STATE BUDGET- THIS MOST RECENT STATE BUDGET PROVIDED AUGMENTATIONS AS WELL. BOTH TO- AUGMENTING THAT MINUTES FOR CALIFORNIA SH WHICH STATUS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DOCUMENTATION WAS. ABOUT A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AND ALSO AUGMENTING THE FUNDING FOR FOOD BANKS AGAIN BY ABOUT A HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS. IN ADDITION IT SHOULD ALSO BE NOTED THAT- THE STATE HAS PROVIDED SOME ASSISTANCE ON DOCUMENTED INDIVIDUALS THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS LARGELY WERE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR ANY OF THE FEDERAL. PROVIDERS FOR THESE EFFORTS UNDER THE DIRECT RELIEF ASSISTANCE FOR IMMIGRANTS PROGRAM THEY WERE ELIGIBLE FOR A STATE FUNDING OF UP TO FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS PER INDIVIDUAL OR THOUSAND DOLLARS PER HOUSEHOLD BUT PROGRAMS. SUCCESSFULLY ALLOCATED MORE THAN SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS. OF STATE FUNDING. THAT WAS VERY OF. SOME RECENT ACTIONS I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. THANK MASS TRANSIT THIS PHONE I'LL TAKE I'LL BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. SERVICE CENTER PAN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION MISTER ANDERSON AND- CERTAINLY WE AS A STATE HAVE TAKEN MANY STEPS TO TRY TO ADDRESS FOOD INSECURITY I'M SURE THERE'S MORE WE COULD TRY TO DO AS WELL- BUT CAN YOU- WELL FIRST OF ALL I GUESS I JUST WANTED MAYBE HAVE YOU COMMENT A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE- I CALFRESH FOR PEOPLE ON SSI ASSIST P. IT'S A FAIRLY RECENT A PROGRAM THAT WAS PASSED- AFTER DECADES FOR WE DIDN'T DO THAT AND HOW'S THAT IMPACTED THOSE FAMILIES ESPECIALLY NOW THAT WE'RE IN THIS KIND OF DOWN BUDGET CYCLE- AND THEN MAYBE PERHAPS- ALSTALK ABOUT- DO YOU DO YOU HAVE CONCERNS ISRAELI- IN TERMS OF- FURTHER FEDERAL FUNDING NEXT YEAR TO BE A FUNDS ARE GOING TO BE EXPIRING. THAT AT LEAST SO FAR BECAUSE THERE'S A LACK OF ACTION AT- THE FEDERAL LEVEL DATA WE MAY EITHER THOSE CAPSULECONTAINING SISTER WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO. SEE WHAT WE CAN DO A STATE THOUGH OUR OWN REVENUES ARE DOWN SO PERHAPS YOU CAN SPEAK TO THOSE TWO ITEMS. THIS COURSE- OKAY. BY SEVERAL ON THE SSA CACHAO. THE INDICATIONS ARE POSITIVE INSOFAR AS- AWFUL LOT OF INDIVIDUALS SIGNED UP. ELIGIBLE UNDER CALFRESH AND BELIEVE THE LATEST FIGURES ARE OVER FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND I BELIEVE THAT WAS WAS CLOSE TO THE MAXIMUM PARTICIPATION THAT WAS ESTIMATED AS FOR THE BENEFIT TO THOSE FAMILIES- AS YOUR WAY FROM BEING INVOLVED AND A LOT OF THE SMITHS THE TRICKY PART WITH PENDING THE SSI CASH ON POLICY WHAT IS THAT. WHILE MOST FAMILIES WOULD NECESSARILY BE BETTER OFF BY RECEIVING THE ADDITIONAL CALFRESH BENEFIT. MINORITY FAMILIES WOULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BECAUSE THE SSI INCOME RECEIVED BY THOSE INDIVIDUALS WOULD BE COUNTED AS INCOME FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE HOUSEHOLD AND IT WOULD EITHER REDUCE OR BENEFIT OR A LAMINATED- THE S. N. B. T. N. B. PROGRAMS WERE SPECIFICALLY CREATED TO TARGET THOSE INDIVIDUALS AND- AND AS FAR AS I KNOW AND I'LL BRING YOUR QUESTION BACK TO THE ANALYST WHO PRIMARILY COVERS A PROGRAM. BUT AS FAR AS I KNOW THOSE PROGRAMS ARE FUNCTIONING AS INTENDED AND SO ALL OF THE FAMILIES THAT ARE NEWLY ENROLLED IN CALFRESH OR OR EARNING AT LEAST AS MUCH AS THEY WERE ON. THE OLD POLICY. AND MOST OF THEM ARE EARNING MORE- THE OTHER QUESTION ABOUT X. THE FEDERAL AID. I DON'T THERE IS STILL SOME ISSUES THAT WILL PROVIDED THROUGH CARES ACTING LAST- CORONAVIRUS RELEASED FOR- THERE WAS PASSED BY CONGRESS- THAT WOULD BE ON THE PANDEMIC EBT SIDE WHICH IS AGAIN. THE- ONE TIME PAYMENTS TO STUDENTS WHO HAVE BEEN IMPACTED BY SCHOOL CLOSURES. EXPECTATIONS AS YOU'LL HEAR FROM DSS ARE DEAD WE WILL. BE ABLE TO CONTINUE THAT PROGRAM THROUGH THE END OF THE SCHOOL YEAR AND WE ARE ALSO EXPECTING TO RECEIVE THE INCREASED CALFRESH BENEFITS THAT'S PROVIDED- MONTH BY MONTH WAIVER WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO RECEIVE THOSE AND TELL THE STATE OF EMERGENCY HAS BEEN WITHDRAWN FROM THE CURRENT PANDEMIC- A LOT OF THESE OTHER. GOOSE AND IN PARTICULAR THE FUNDING INCREASE THAT WAS OFFERED TO OUR EMERGENCY FOOD PROVIDERS SUCH AS FOOD BANKS WERE ON A ONE TIME BASIS SO THERE IS SOME CONCERN THAT- AND I THINK THE NEXT PANEL SPEAK TO THE ISSUE OF. SOME ADVOCATES ARE CALLING THIS THE- T. SHIRT CLICK. AND A LOT OF THAT FUND WILL BE. BY THE END DISCOUNT YEAR AND ISN'T AT THIS TIME BEING REPLACED IT WOULD NEED TO BE FURTHER. AUGMENTATIONS FROM EITHER THE FEDERAL OR STATE GOVERNMENT- IF DEMAND REMAINS HIGH. THANK YOU. THANK YOU I WANTED TO GO AHEAD AND- YOUR FURTHER ASK AT WATER SOME OF THE IT JUST IN GENERAL SOME CONCERNS THAT. YOU'RE KIND OF EXPECTING OR LOOKING INTO ARE JUST KIND OF SEEING HER COME ACROSS- I MEAN. ALL THE PROGRAMS AND THE FUNDING THAT THAT HAS COME IN A MINUTE IT'S A GREAT THING BUT- BUT WHAT IS IT. THAT WE SHOULD KNOW ABOUT IN TERMS OF CONCERN SAID THAT YOU MAY HAVE HER. THAT WE SHOULD KNOW ABOUT RIGHT. CERTAINLY THE PRIMARY CONCERN IS THAT AS YOUR FIRST PANEL NOTED JUST TO. DEMAND CONTINUES TO BE GREAT FOR THESE PROGRAMS SAID AS MUCH ASSISTANCE HAS BEEN AVAILABLE. THERE ARE STILL MANY FAMILIES OUT THERE WHO ARE EXPERIENCING FOOD INSECURITY AND- ALSO TO SENATOR PAN'S PREVIOUS QUESTION. WHEN A LOT OF THESE INITIAL RELIEF MEASURES FOR OR WERE PASSED IN THE SPRING IT WASN'T CLEAR JUST HOW LONG- THE UNCERTAINTY AND- STAGNANT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS WOULD CONTINUE. FOLLOWING SEND AND MAKE A I THINK RIGHT NOW THERE IS SOME CONCERN THAT WE MAY BE IN FOR A WATCH MUCH LONGER PERIOD OF STAGNATION OF THE INCREASED DEMAND FOR THESE PROGRAMS WHICH MAY SPEAK TO A NEED FOR FURTHER ASSISTANCE- I WOULD SAY ONE THING- I WOULDN'T EXPRESSES A CONCERN BUT IT IS PERHAPS A SURPRISE- INSTEAD TO SOME OF US ARE. WOMEN LOOKING AT NUMBERS HAS. BEEN THAT- HOUSE CHRISTIAN- IT IS HASN'T WELL HAS INCREASED SINCE. MANY FOLKS BEEN ROLLED IN THE PROGRAM IS HAS NOT QUITE THE DEGREE THAT WE X. GIVEN. CURRENT AND NUMBER ARE- I DON'T SAY THAT OUR OFFICE HAS DONE A LOT OF WORK AND SAID. ASKING COUNTY OFFICES LEGAL ASSISTANCE SERVICES CONSUMERS THEMSELVES WHETHER- IS RELATIVELY LOW ENROLLMENT MIGHT BE DUE TO SOME ACCESS PROBLEMS AND WE HAVEN'T HEARD ANYTHING FROM ANY OF THOSE SOURCES THAT WOULD INDICATE THAT'S A MAJOR CONCERN- BUT I WILL SAY IT IS STILL SOMETHING THAT'S A LITTLE. BUT IT STANDS OUT A LITTLE BIT AND IN PARTICULAR WE HAVEN'T SEEN A LARGE CASELOAD INCREASE AFTER THE FIRST FEW MONTHS OF THE PROGRAM AND IN FACT IN RECENT MONTHS- PARTICIPATION HAS DECLINED SOMEWHAT AND WE'RE JUST NOT ENTIRELY SURE. WHAT THAT IS. DO YOU FEEL THAT IN TERMS OF ALL THE- THE FOR THE RESOURCES AT THE STATE HAS BEEN GETTING- YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF FOOD. TO FILL THAT THE ALL THE PROGRAMS ARE BEING. MAXIMIZED TO THE FULL CAPACITY OF AN- AND DELIVERING FOOD TO- OUR MOST VULNERABLE. IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT QUESTION TO ANSWER FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE- CERTAINLY THE PROGRAMS IF NOT- IN STRUGGLING TO FIND ENOUGH. PEOPLE WITH MEAT OUT THERE AND THEN MANY TIMES IF YOU'RE ABLE TO GET AND THE SAME WITH THE DIRECTOR WHAT THE ASSISTANCE FOR IMMIGRANTS PROGRAM THAT FUNDING WAS ABLE TO FIND A HOME VERY QUICKLY A LOT OF TIMES WHEN THAT HAPPENS RIGHT IS BUT IF THE PROGRAM ISN'T UNDERFUNDED AND THERE'S REASONABLE CONCERN ARE IT ISN'T OBVIOUSLY OVERFUNDED THERE'S REASONABLE CONCERN THAT IT MIGHT BE UNDER FROM. BUT IF IT IF IT WAS THAT EASY FIND ENOUGH WILLING- RECIPIENTS. AND MAYBE FURTHER AUGMENTATIONS ARE WARRANTED IT'S A LITTLE HARD TO TELL FROM. IN SACRAMENTO EXACTLY WHAT THE UNMET NEED IS- THIS JUST SAY AGAIN THE THING ABOUT THE CALFRESH IS. WE STILL DO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS THERE AND THAT MIGHT ALSO BE INDICATIVE EITHER OF THE FACT THAT NEED ISN'T AS GREAT AS- WE ARE PROJECTED TOWARD THAT- THERE ARE SOME INDIVIDUALS OUT THERE THAT WOULD BENEFIT FROM THIS PROGRAM WHO. JUST HAVEN'T FOUND A WAY TO GET. SO HOW DO YOU THINK WE COULD AT BEST FIGURE OUT THIS MONTH YOU KNOW UNMET NEED. THAT SAYS A CHALLENGING QUESTION I'M AFRAID I DON'T HAVE ANY CSU FOR IT NOW MIGHT BE A USEFUL QUESTION FOR SOME OF THE PROGRAM ADMINISTRATOR SONG- YOUR EXPAND WILL. WHAT WE APPRECIATE YOU JOINING US HERE TODAY AND- JUST LEAVE IT OPEN FOR ANY LAST QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. SEEN NONE OKAY WE WILL THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US AND- YOU KNOW WHAT THIS BILL WILL MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT PANEL. WHICH WILL SHARE EFFORTS TO MEET INCREASED NEED FOR NUTRITION ASSISTANCE STRYCOVA NINETEEN PANDEMIC. WE HAVE BEEN ASKED TO CHANGE THE ORDER OF OUR AGENDA SO A RYAN BURRIS THE REPRESENTED FROM THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES. WELL FALL ALEXIS FERNANDES WAS REPRESENTING THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US AND- PLEASE FEEL FREE TO BEGIN WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. HELLO SELECT ALEXIS ARE YOU THERE. I AM HERE OKAY THANK YOU BUT I'M READY HEARING OKAY HI GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS OF THE CANADIAN THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME SO MY NAME'S ALEXIS FERNANDEZ AND THE CHIEF OF THE CALFRESH AND NUTRITION BRANCH OF THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES MY BRANCH OVERSEES THE ADMINISTRATION OF SEVEN FEDERAL NUTRITION PROGRAMS AS WELL AS SEVERAL STATE FUNDED PROGRAMS MANY OF WHICH HAVE BEEN MENTIONED TODAY. IMPORTANTLY WE OVERSEE ADMINISTRATION OF THE STATE'S SUPPLEMENTAL NUTRITION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM OR SNAP I KNOWN AS CALFRESH IN CALIFORNIA THE SCALE SCOPE AND REACH OF SNAP AS AN ENTITLEMENT PROGRAM MAKE IT THE NATION'S MOST IMPORTANT ANTI HUNGER PROGRAM. NOT SAID CALFRESH CANNOT DO IT ALONE- A FULL ECOSYSTEM OF NUTRITION SUPPORTS INCLUDING MANY OF WHICH MY FELLOW PANEL MEMBERS WILL SPEAK TO TODAY MAKE UP THE NUTRITION SAFETY NET. I'M GOING TO SPEAK TO OUR EFFORTS TO RESPOND TO THE PANDEMIC EMERGENCY INCLUDING OUR WORK DISTRIBUTING EMERGENCY FOOD. EFFORTS TO ENSURE CALPERS BENEFIT ACCESS DURING THE EMERGENCY AND ALSO TELL YOU ABOUT OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO IMPLEMENT THE FIRST EVER PANDEMIC AB T. PROGRAM SO BEAR WITH ME QUITE A BIT OF CONTENT. THE STATE'S EMERGENCY FOOD SYSTEM PROVIDES A CRITICAL RESOURCE FOR INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES ACROSS THE STATE IT NOT ONLY ALLOWS FAMILIES TO MAKE ENDS MEET BUT IT MAY ALSO BE THE ONLY RESOURCE AVAILABLE WHEN ALL OR SOME MEMBERS ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR FEDERAL FOOD BENEFITS. I WANT TO SHARE A BIT MORE ON THIS POINT BASED ON WHAT WE LEARNED IMPLEMENTING THE DISASTER RELIEF ASSISTANCE PROGRAM FOR IMMIGRANTS HERE AT THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES. DRAY PROVIDED A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND UNDOCUMENTED CALIFORNIANS IMPACTED BY THE PANDEMIC FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS AND DISASTER ASSISTANCE AS PART OF THE APPLICATION PROCESS UNDOCUMENTED CALIFORNIANS WERE ASKED TO ANSWER A QUESTION ABOUT UNMET NEEDS HOUSING WAS THE HIGHEST UNMET. NEED 86% SELECT THIS OPTION NOT SO. THIS HIGHEST WAS FOR. FIFTY THREE. SAID FOOD WAS AN UNNAMED. THREE RECIPIENTS ALSO REPORTED RELYING ON LOCAL FOOD BANKS AND SOMETIMES GOING HUNGRY AS A PANDEMIC LAST BREADWINNERS UNEMPLOYED. I SURE THESE DETAILS WITH YOU TO EMPHASIZE THE ROLE OF THE EMERGENCY FOOD NETWORK AND SUPPORTING ALL CALIFORNIANS WHEN FEDERAL PROGRAMS MAY NOT BE ABLE TO. BECAUSE OUR PARTNERS ARE AT THE TABLE WILL BE SHARING THEIR EXPERIENCE IN MORE DETAIL ONLY SPEND A FEW MINUTES ON THE SUPPORTIVE ROLE THAT WE PLAYED THESE LAST FEW MONTHS. BYE NEED TO TWENTY TWENTY ONE IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE ASSOCIATION OF FOOD BANKS WILL HAVE DISTRIBUTED A HUNDRED AND TEN MILLION DOLLARS AND- FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS AND DIAPERS. I WILL HAVE PROVIDED FORTY MILLION DOLLARS IN REIMBURSEMENT FOR CLOSELY RELATED FOOD EXPENSES. AND THESE ARE ALL OF THE- EXTRA INVESTMENTS IF YOU WILL SPECIFIC TO THE PANDEMIC. MUCH OF THIS WAS STATE FUNDED AND A RESULT OF THE LEGISLATURES AND ADMINISTRATIONS CONTINUED COMMITMENT TO ENSURING ADEQUATE EMERGENCY FOOD RESOURCES. ON AVERAGE WERE DISTRIBUTING A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND FOOD BOXES A MONTH AN ESTIMATE THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO DO SO IT CURRENT FUNDING UNTIL MAY TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THROUGHOUT TWENTY WE'VE ALSO SEEN A SIGNIFICANT INFUSION OF FEDERAL RESOURCES RYAN MENTIONED THESE TOTALING AN ADDITIONAL SEVENTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE EMERGENCY FOOD ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. REPRESENTING ABOUT A NINETEEN. IT'S UNCLEAR WHAT TWENTY TWENTY ONE WILL BRING IN TERMS OF ADDITIONAL FEDERAL RESOURCES FOR EMERGENCY FOOD BUT WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT WITHOUT FEDERAL ACTION WE ANTICIPATE A SIGNIFICANT GAP IN RESOURCES. OR THE EMERGENCY FOOD NETWORK WHEN YOU COMPARE TWENTY TWENTY TWO WHAT WE ANTICIPATE AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND CURRENT STATE FUNDING WILL BE ABLE TO FILL THAT GAP. WELL EMERGENCY FOOD IS AN ESSENTIAL RESOURCE CALFRESH PLAYS A KEY ROLE IN PREVENTING HUNGER BY PROVIDING INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES WITH LOW INCOME. CONSIDERABLE MONTHLY FOOD BENEFITS. IN APRIL OF TWENTY TWENTY OUR APPLICATION VOLUME PEAKED AT JUST OVER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND CALFRESH APPLICATIONS RECEIVED DISTRICT WIDE IN ONE WEEK. AND SINCE LEVELED OUT WE ARE NOW ACCEPTING IN THE RANGE OF FORTY TO FIFTY THOUSAND APPLICATIONS A WEEK CLOSER TO PRE PANDEMIC LEVELS OUR CASE LOAD OR THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE SERVED. THE MONTH OF JUNE TWENTY TWENTY JUST OVER FOUR POINT EIGHT FOUR MILLION INDIVIDUALS- AND HAS NOW- EXCEEDED. FOR THE MOST RECENT MONTH FOR WHICH DATA IS AVAILABLE- FOUR POINT SIX MILLION. BENEFITS ISSUED IN SEPTEMBER TOTALED OVER FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS WITH THE ISSUANCE OF EMERGENCY ALLOTMENTS WHICH I'LL SPEAK TO IN JUST A MINUTE WE'RE PROVIDING A HUNDRED NINETY TWO DOLLARS A MONTH IN FOOD BENEFITS PER PERSON. THIS IS CONSIDERABLE IN TERMS OF CALIFORNIANS ABILITY TO PUT ENOUGH FOOD ON THE TABLE AND FOR LOCAL ECONOMIES- IS THAT SIGNIFICANT STIMULUS AS RECIPIENTS TEND TO SPEND BENEFITS RIGHT AWAY AT LOCAL STORES. I'M NOT GONNA GO INTO MORE DETAIL- FROM A DATA PERSPECTIVE I HAVE SUBMITTED SOME SLIDES FOR YOUR REFERENCE. INCLUDING OUR SSI RECIPIENTS CASELOAD WHICH I JUST MENTIONED AND- DOCTOR PAN DID RAISE THIS AND HIS COMMENTS OF FOR THE MONTH OF AUGUST OR SEPTEMBER TWENTY TWENTY. WE'RE ACTUALLY SERVING OVER FIVE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY TWO THOUSAND SS I RECIPIENTS AS A RESULT OF THE EXPANSION AND DEFINITELY. BE ABLE TO PROVIDE MORE INFO ABOUT THAT IS THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL. IN RESPONSE TO APPLICATION VOLUME CASELOAD INCREASES AND SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTIONS TO OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND WORK FORCE CAPACITY- WE'VE IMPLEMENTED SEVERAL ADMINISTRATIVE FLEXIBILITIES AND PROVIDED GUIDANCE AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. TO COUNTIES WITH THE AIM OF MAINTAINING TIMELY ACCESS TO BENEFITS. OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS WE IMPLEMENTED SEVEN FEDERAL ADMINISTRATIVE WAIVERS RANGING FROM REPORTING FLEXIBILITY THROUGH WAIVERS OF THE INTERVIEW REQUIREMENTS. THESE WAIVERS PROVIDED WORKLOAD RELIEF FOR COUNTIES FREEING UP CAPACITY TO ADDRESS APPLICATION VOLUME AND MAINTAIN TIMELINESS. IMPORTANTLY ALSO SUPPORTED ACCESS TO BENEFITS BY OUR CLIENTS. BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT THESE FLEXIBILITIES ARMY AB ALTHOUGH BY CONGRESS OR THE USDA WE WILL CONTINUE TO ASSESS IMPLEMENTATION HERE IN CALIFORNIA. RT ALSO GUIDANCE ON DISCLOSURE AND REPORTING PROCEDURES AND JUST RECENTLY ISSUED GUIDANCE REITERATING THE NEED TO ENSURE IN PERSON ACCESS TO BENEFITS IN CONJUNCTION WITH PHONE AND INTERNET BASED SERVICES. I WOULD HAVE INCREASED OUR THE LAND OF THE PANDA WHICH WE'RE STILL IN. THIS GUIDANCE INCLUDE RESOURCE AND BEST PRACTICES SHOULD SOME OF THE CHALLENGES FACED BY DURING THESE ARE PRESS TIME. OUR OPERATE TEAM CAN TO CONDUCT REVIEWS- WE ARE AGAIN. TIMELINESS AND OTHER ACTOR OF OUR OFF. AND EXPANDING ACT TO RE WILL FOR SERVICES THROUGH NEW REMOTE LEARNING TOOLS AND THINGS LIKE AN INNOVATIVE LAPTOP LOANER PROGRAM. TO ADDRESS BENEFIT ADEQUACY WE'VE ISSUED AT EIGHT MONTHS OF EMERGENCY ALLOTMENTS THUS FAR AND RYAN MENTIONED THESE EMERGENCY ALLOTMENTS BRING EVERY RETAIL FRANCHISE SOLD TO THE MAXIMUM ALLOTMENT BASED ON HOUSEHOLD SIZE. SO FOR EXAMPLE A HOUSEHOLD OF THREE RECEIVES FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE DOLLARS A MONTH WHEN YOU TOTAL THEIR REGULAR CALFRESH AND THEIR EMERGENCY ALONG. THESE SUPPLEMENTS ARE REPRESENTS OVER ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS IN ADDITIONAL BENEFITS AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO ISSUE THEM SO LONG AS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MAKES THEM AVAILABLE TO US. APRIL WE WERE THE FIRST STATE TO EXPAND IMPLEMENTATION OF T. V. T. ONLINE PURCHASING IN RESPONSE TO THE PANDEMIC. BUT WE WATCH WITH TO RETAILERS AMAZON AND WALMART AND- JUST THIS MONTH ON NOVEMBER TWELFTH BY THE ALBERTSON'S FAMILY OF BRANDS WHICH INCLUDE BONDS AND SAFE WAY A LAUNCH EDT ONLINE PURCHASING FOR PICK UP AT PARTICIPATING STORES AND IN EARLY TWENTY TWENTY ONE WILL WANT YOU TO BE ONLINE FOR HOME DELIVERY. INDIRECT WE'VE ALSO HAD TO RESPOND TO WILDFIRE SEASON UNLIKE ANY OTHER. SO IN RESPONSE TO POWER OUTAGES THAT RESULTED FROM A PREVENTIVE MEASURES AND WILDFIRES THEMSELVES WE'VE ISSUED AUTOMATIC REPLACEMENT. HOW FRESH BENEFITS TOTAL VALUE OF OVER FIVE MILLION DOLLARS- AND WE'VE REQUESTED WAIVERS ALLOWING HOUSEHOLDS MORE TIME TO REQUEST A BENEFIT REPLACEMENTS AND PURCHASED FOODS WHEN THEY MAY NOT HAVE ACCESS TO A KITCHEN BECAUSE OF A DISASTER. WE ARE STILL IN THE MIDST OF OPERATIONS THIS WEEK WE'VE IMPLEMENTED DISASTER CALFRESH. IN NINETEEN COUNTIES DISASTER CAL FROM TEMPER FOOD. FOR IN THE IN FAMILIES THAT ARE NOT TYPICALLY ELLA FOR A CAL FRESH BUT TYPICALLY DOES CALFRESH WILL AN PERSON. INTO BUT WE WERE ABLE TO SPEAK UP FOR FEDERAL FLOOD. THAT HAVE ALLOWED US FOR THE FIRST TIME TO OPERATE PRIMARILY BY SOME. INCLUDING IN INTERVIEWS I THOUGHT. IN ADDITION TO THIS WORK IT HAS BEEN MENTIONED THAT WE RECEIVED A FEDERAL FEDERAL APPROVAL TO OPERATE TO THE PANDEMIC ET OR PT T. PROGRAM. IN RESPONSE TO KOBE NINETEEN RELATED SCHOOL FACILITY CLOSURES HAVE PROVIDES FOOD BENEFITS TO CHILDREN. WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR FREE OR REDUCED PRICE SCHOOL MEALS AND WHO BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC RELATED SCHOOL FACILITY CLOSURE MAY NOT HAVE READY ACCESS TO THOSE MEALS. SO BETWEEN APRIL AND SEPTEMBER TWENTY TWENTY WE OPERATED- WHAT WE'RE NOW CALLING PT ONE POINT OH OR THE ORIGINAL P. B. PROGRAM. THE USDA PROVIDED GUIDANCE ON MARCH TWENTIETH APRIL TWENTY FOURTH OUR PLAN WAS APPROVED AND BY MAY EIGHTH WE HAD ISSUED OUR FIRST PT CARD. THE GREAT MAJORITY OF FAMILIES RECEIVED A STANDARD BENEFIT OF THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE DOLLARS PER CHILD- REPRESENTING A SIGNIFICANT BOOST IN NUTRITION SUPPORT. AND BY LATE SEPTEMBER WE HAD WRAPPED UP THE PROGRAM HAVING ISSUED BENEFITS TO OVER THREE POINT SEVEN MILLION CHILDREN OR ABOUT 95% OF THOSE WHO ARE ELIGIBLE. TOTALING NEARLY ONE POINT FOUR BILLION. DOLLARS AND THE BENEFITS. NUMBER WERE ALSO AGREED TO ISSUE ADDITIONAL BENEFITS TO CHILDREN WHO HAVE PREVIOUSLY RECEIVED PTT ONE POINT OH OR THE ORIGINAL PROGRAM. ONLY BEGAN ISSUING THOSE BENEFITS ON OCTOBER TWENTY SIX AND WILL CONTINUE DOING SO THROUGH THE END OF DECEMBER. THOSE EXTENSION BENEFITS ARE ANTICIPATED TO TOTAL ABOUT SIX HUNDRED AND SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS IN ADDITIONAL NUTRITION. SUPPORT NO SIGNIFICANT IMPORTANCE IN AND RYAN AND ARE OTHERS SPEAKERS MENTION THIS AT THE END OF OCTOBER CONGRESS AUTHORIZED THE SECOND ROUND OF PANDEMIC U. T. FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE SCHOOL YEAR THAT'S A SCHOOL YOU'RE WERE CURRENTLY IN NOW. WILL BE CALLING THAT TIME AT LEAST FOR NOW PANDEMIC YOU NEED TO TWO POINT OO I LIKE THE ORIGINAL PROGRAM IT WILL SERVE SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR FREE OR REDUCED PRICE MEALS ARE UNIQUELY THIS IS NEW. WE WILL HAVE THE OPTION TO SERVE AS YOUNGER CHILDREN WHO ARE CHILD CARE AGE AND WHO WOULD HAVE RECEIVED A FREE OR REDUCED PRICE MEAL AT CHILD CARE IF NOT FOR DISRUPTIONS IN ACCESS I DO THE PANDEMIC. IT WILL. A P. B. T. TWO POINT OH WON'T NECESSARILY BE EASY EITHER WILL BE EXTENSIVE DATA REQUIREMENTS WILL BE SERVING A NEW POPULATION OF YOUNGER CHILDREN. WE'RE GONNA BE DOING SO OVER THE LENGTH OF AN ENTIRE SCHOOL YEAR. ABOUT SEVEN IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WE'RE UP FOR THE CHALLENGE. WE JUST RECEIVED PARTIAL FEDERAL GUIDANCE YESTERDAY LATE BREAKING. UP FOR SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN AND WE ARE NOW WAITING ON GUIDANCE FOR CHILDREN WHO ATTEND CHILD CARE. WILL BEGIN DEVELOPING OUR PLANS AND HOPE TO BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT TIMELY- AGAIN LOTS OF WRITING HERE ON. FEDERAL GUIDANCE BUT- WE ARE STARTING THAT PROCESS TO PLAN AND IMPLEMENT THE NEW PROGRAM. WHICH WE'VE BEEN QUITE BUSY BUT OUR WORK IS NOT DONE AS I JUST SUGGESTED- WE- ARE THE IMPACTS OF THE PANDEMIC CONTINUE TO BE FELT BY ALL CALIFORNIANS. CALFRESH AND OTHER ESSENTIAL NUTRITION SUPPORTS WILL PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN ENSURING A TO HELP THE. HEALTHY CALIFORNIA FOR ALL. I CAN'T TRIP UP WITHOUT THINKING LEGISLATURE IN THE ADMINISTRATION FOR THEIR COMMITMENT TO PREVENTING EXPERIENCE OF HUNGER AS WE WORK TO MITIGATE THE IMPACTS OF THE PANDEMIC. AND OUR PARTNERS- WITHOUT THEM REALLY NONE OF THIS COULD HAVE HAPPENED SO THE FOOD BANKS COUNTY HUMAN SERVICE AGENCIES THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION OR OUTREACH PARTNER OUR CLIENTS. ADVOCATES WHO THAT KEEP US- ATTUNED TO WHAT OUR CLIENTS ARE EXPERIENCING. OF COURSE- I SHOUT OUT TO MY TEAM AS WELL FOR THEIR INCREDIBLE WORK I KNOW THEY'RE WATCHING TODAY- SO I RECOGNIZE SUCH OVERWHELMING AMOUNT OF INFORMATION I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS OR PROVIDE MORE DETAILS AS NEEDED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISS RANDA'S APPRECIATE- THE M. YOUR TASK IF YOU CAN JUST STAND BY THERE MAY BE QUESTIONS LATER. WHEN THE- TRIMMING ITS BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ROOM.

THANK YOU MISTER BYRD- MOVE ON TO THE- PANEL AND MUST AND- QUESTIONS RIGHT NOW- FROM THE- MANY OKAY- AND IS NEXT IS A- KATHY CENTER LEE MCDONALD'S ARE CORRECT. YES THANK YOU SENATOR NICE TO CEO TO CHANGE EVERYONE THANKS TO THE SENATORS AND THEIR STAFF FOR PUTTING THAT THE HEARING TOGETHER OBVIOUSLY A REALLY IMPORTANT TOPIC AND I THINK THAT PERTH THE PANEL ESPECIALLY THE TO- INDIVIDUAL CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE SUFFERING. FOOD INSECURITY REALLY I THINK BROUGHT THAT MESSAGE HOME FOR ALL OF US TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE CAN DO. EVERYTHING WE CAN DO TO SUPPORT OUR OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND IN THE CASE OF THE WTA SUPPORTER HUMAN SERVICES AGENCIES TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE GETTING OUT THERE ARE DOING THAT OUR REGION MAKING AS MANY. FOLKS WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR CALFRESH- ELIGIBLE FOR THAT AND HELP THEM NOT ONLY GET ON THE PROGRAM BUT ALSO RETAIN THE PROGRAM. I WANTED TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT WE'RE SEEING IN THE COUNTY HAS. SOME OF THE EFFORTS THAT WE'VE UNDERTAKEN IN SOME OF THE INNOVATIONS AND THEN SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE'RE SEEING IN A FEW IDEAS FOR FLEXIBILITY THAN THAT OF COURSE HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. AS THE- ALEXIS HERNANDEZ NOTED FROM PDFS WE DID SEE QUITE A SIGNIFICANT SPIKE IN APPLICATIONS VERY EARLY IN THE PANDEMIC DURING A FIVE WEEK PERIOD OF ABOUT MID MARCH TO LATE APRIL WE RECEIVED ALMOST FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND APPLICATIONS JUST ALL IN THAT FIVE WEEK PERIOD IF YOU COUNT A COUPLE OF WEEKS AROUND AS IT WAS HE CAN GOING DOWN A LITTLE OVER FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND APPLICATIONS. WHICH IS PRETTY SIGNIFICANT HE TYPICALLY WE WOULD HAVE SEEN THAT TIED A STEADY PACE OF AROUND FORTY THOUSAND A WEEK NOT THE NINETY THOUSAND TO ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND THAT WE'RE SEEING DURING. THOSE FEW WEEKS IF YOU AVERAGE THEM OUT. I MORE OPEN SEEING ANYTHING OVER. I AN INCREASE CASELOAD OF. IF YOU THINK I WHAT WE EING PER. BY IS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES. BACK IN JANUARY BEFORE ALL OF THIS HAPPENED AT THE PET PANDEMIC HIT IN MID MARCH. THE ORIGINAL JANUARY BUDGET PROJECTED A DECLINE. THAT CAN'T DECLINE IT ACTUALLY STARTED BACK IN TWENTY FIFTEEN FOR CALIFORNIA. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF LAST YEAR AND THE EXPANSION OF THE EFFORT BY POPULATION. THEY'RE GONNA STUDY THE QUIET AND THE REASON FOR THAT WAS LARGELY DUE TO THE IMPROVING ECONOMY. THAT HAD BEEN LONG SUSTAINED OVER THOSE YEARS. SO OVER NINETEEN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY AS WELL AS THE CURRENT YEAR TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND- NEVER BEEN UP PROJECTED DROP OF ABOUT THREE POINT THREE PERCENT. AND BY NEXT JUNE OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE ARE- CASELOAD PROJECTIONS OF THE NUMBER OF HOUSEHOLDS NOT INDIVIDUALS. WAS PROJECTED AT ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION. AS OF. THE END OF LAST MONTH THE MOST RECENT DATA- UPDATED- IN LATE OCTOBER. WE WERE CARRYING TWO POINT FIVE MILLION CASES THAT YOU CAN BE QUITE A SUBSTANTIAL. DIFFERENCE NOT JUST IN SORT OF ABSOLUTE GROWTH BUT ALSO IF YOU THINK ABOUT WHERE WE WERE EXPECTING TO SEE THAT CONTINUE TO QUIET. NOW HAS REVERSED AND GONE WELL ABOVE WHERE WE THOUGHT THAT WE WOULD BE. AND SO- COUNTY FOR THAT SAME KIND THEMSELVES WORK WERE. STRUGGLING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THEY SHOULD BE DOING- FOLLOWING LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH ORDERS WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. TO TRY TO KEEP THE DOORS OPEN EITHER LITERALLY OR FIGURATIVELY AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE TO ENSURE THAT OUR COMMUNITIES CAN STILL GAIN ACCESS TO THE AND OTHER PROGRAMS THAT WE OPERATE. THE MOST OF THE COUNTIES TODAY HAVE AT LEAST ONE OFFICE OPEN AND MANY HAVE ALL OR MOST OF THEIR OFFICES OPEN. AT TIMES- THEY MAY HAVE LIMITED HOURS OR LIMITED SERVICES OR REQUIRE REQUIRE APPOINTMENTS. FOR SERVICES THAT MIGHT TAKE A I BIT LONGER ACTUAL FILING APPLE. OR ENTERED FOR WHO ARE TO COME IN AND THAT- AND IF YOU- HAVE STAFF ON HAND TO DO. IN PERSON TRIAGE OR END OR SORT OF WALK UP WINDOWS AND WALK UP SERVICE FOR FOLKS TO COME TO THAT- LAW OFFICE EVEN AT THE OFFICE MAY NOT OTHERWISE BE GENERALLY OPEN TO THE PUBLIC. THEY'RE ABLE TO HELP THEM IN A DISTANCE AWAY THAT WILL ENABLE THEIR SERVICES TO BE PROVIDED TO THEM. WE'VE ALSO SEEN A PRACTICE USED INCREASINGLY ACROSS THE COUNTY THE FACT I KNOW OF ONLY ONE COUNTY HAT DIDN'T HAVE IT IN PLACE- IN A RECENT SURVEY. AND THAT WAS A SMALL COUNTY THAT NEVER CLOSE- IF THE USER DROP BOXES. SO BOXES WERE INDIVIDUALS CAN DROP APPLICATIONS VERIFICATION THAT ARE NEEDED TO COMPLETE THAT PROCESS SAYING- INFORMATION ABOUT CHANGES THAT HAVE OCCURRED REDETERMINATION. AND THINGS LIKE THAT SO THEY CAN LEAVE THAT INFORMATION AT THE COUNTY FOR SOMEONE TO BE ABLE TO PROCESS. BOND NUMBER OF THE COUNTY OFFICES DO HAVE WORKERS- ON WHAT SHIFT QUITE OFTEN PRESERVING THAT SOCIAL DISTANCING THAT IS NOT OPEN TO THE PUBLIC SO THERE ARE PEOPLE THERE WHO CAN. GET THE INFORMATION FROM THE DROP BOXES AND STILL CONTINUE TO PROCESS THEM AND OF COURSE IN ADDITION TO THOSE-IN PERSON SERVICES THAT ARE AVAILABLE. WE'VE GOT ONLINE- BY PHONE BY FAX BY EMAIL- ALL OF THOSE STILL AVAILABLE ACROSS THE BOARD FOR. PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS SERVICES AND GET THE HEALTH CRISIS WELL AS OUR CAL WORKED. AND MEDICAL SERVICES- OVERWHELMINGLY WHEN WE ARE THE COUNTY- IF YOU'RE NOT FULLY- OPEN WHY THAT THE NUMBER ONE ANSWER WAS BASED WAS DUE TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH ORDERS IN THEIR COUNTIES. ON END OR ORDERS FROM THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. SOME DO SO REPORT STAFFING ISSUES I THINK THOSE WERE MORE IF YOU EARLY IN THE PANDEMIC BUT WE ARE STILL HEARING THAT COUNTIES HAVE- A NUMBER OF THEIR- INDIVIDUAL STAFF WHO MAY HAVE OVER ABILITIES. TO COAL BED THEY MAY BE OUT ON LEAVE- THEY MAY HAVE LIMITED ACCESS TO THE INTERNET ESPECIALLY THE RURAL AREAS TO BE ABLE TO WORK FROM HOME- AND THERE'S ONGOING CONCERN ESPECIALLY I THINK WE WOULD BE AT INCREASING NOW. OF A CONCERN OVER INFECTION AND- ACTUALLY GETTING THE VIRUS IF THEY GO IN- AND THERE HAVE BEEN SOME LIMITED EXAMPLES OF THEM TRANSMISSIONS OCCURRING IN OUR OFFICES. BUT OVERWHELMINGLY IT'S BASED ON. WHERE THE COUNTY IS AND WHAT THE PUBLIC. HEALTH ORDERS ARE AT THAT TIME. I AND THERE'S AN GOING TO BE. THAT THE PLACE TO LOOK THAT- IN OUR THAT'S OF OUR REGION OUT STATIONING THAT THEY'VE BEEN DOING A- BURIED ABOUT BY COUNT AND BY THEIR COMMUNITY MEANS. BUT WE- AND I COULD TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOU TO THESE AS- YOU'RE AT THE MEMBERS ARE INTERESTED- A NUMBER THEY COUNTIES REPORTED DOING REALLY SPECIFIC OUT REACHED A FARM WORKER POPULATION. WE HAVE- A LOT OF WORK IN EVERY SPEAKING DONE WITH PROJECT ROOM HE HOMELESS SHELTERS AND STREET TEAM. TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WORKS FINING THOSE FOLKS UP AS WELL- THE IN PERSON TRIAGE TO BE ABLE TO HELP PEOPLE. GET IN PLACE. AND ALSO- A NUMBER OF. LOCAL PARTNERSHIPS- THERE'S A NUMBER OF. THE COALITION TO TRY TO IMPROVE SERVICE SERVICE IS AN ACT THAT. THEY'RE WORKING WITH THEIR FOOD BANKS THEIR CLINICS AND THEIR PUBLIC HOSPITALS. ONE COUNTY WITH THE PUBLIC HOSPITAL FOR EXAMPLE- NOTED THAT THEY- APPROVED SEVEN HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE PEOPLE JUST IN THE PUBLIC HOSPITAL BETWEEN. MARCH AND SEPTEMBER ALONE. SOME OF THE AREAS THAT THEY COUNTY THAT. FOR I DO CAN. AS WE LOOK FORWARD TO WHAT'S COMING NEXT WEEK SO I THINK YOU'RE A GREAT PERIOD OF UNCERTAINTY AS OTHERS HAVE TESTIFIED AND- AS OF AS OF COURSE THE THAT YOU'RE IN THE MEMBERS NOW- CERTAINLY WE'RE HOPEFUL THAT WE'LL BE ABLE TO WORK WITH THE STATE AND THE NEW. THE INCOMING FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION TO EXPAND THE FLEXIBILITY AS AND SORT OF RESTART SOME OF THE FLEXIBILITY THAT WE THOUGHT EARLIER IN THE PANDEMIC- THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF STOPS AND STARTS. TO SOME OF THOSE FEDERALLY ALLOWED FLEXIBILITY IS AND I THINK YEAH. UNDERSTANDABLE RELUCTANCE ON THE PART OF THE ADMINISTRATION TO GO FURTHER THAN WHAT IS ALLOWED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BECAUSE WE COULD LOSE FUNDING- AND HAVE TO PAY. BACK OR PAY BENEFITS OUT OF OUR POCKETS AND AGAIN THAT DOESN'T APPLY IN THE CALFRESH WORLD- BUT WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS THAT THERE ARE. SOME AREAS WHERE THERE'S NOT UNIFORMITY OUR MEDIC HEALTH RULES ARE DIFFERENT FROM CALFRESH. UNUSUALLY HELP PRESSING CAL WORK SO THE SAME BUT THERE'S EVEN BEEN SOME DIFFERENCES THERE. I DON'T THINK WE FAULT THE STATE FOR THE DECISIONS THAT IT NEEDED TO MAKE IN ORDER TO DO THAT. BUT STRIVING TOGETHER FOR AS MUCH OF THAT UNIFORMITY OF POSSIBLE AND ADVOCATING FOR PERMISSION TO MAKE THE PROGRAM'S UNIFORM AND HOW WE- TREAT YOUR GOT YOU WHY INCOME AND THE DIFFERENT. BENEFITS DOCUMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN RECEIVED WHICH DIFFER IN SOME CASES. ACROSS THE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS. ON ALLOWING SIMILARLY FLEXIBLE INTERVIEWING ACROSS THE THREE PROGRAMS AS NEEDED- ARE A FEW OF THE AREAS THERE- AND THEN FINALLY- IN THAT AREA. THIS KIND OF FIGURE OUT HOW TO MINIMIZE THE DOUBLE WORKLOAD FOR OUR STAFF. ONE THING WE REALLY APPRECIATED. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ALLOWED US TO KEEP PEOPLE ON THE PROGRAM WE WERE ABLE TO JUST BASICALLY- CONSIDER. SEMI ANNUAL REPORTS THAT ARE REQUIRED BY EVERY HOUSEHOLD TO BE GOOD WE DIDN'T EVEN HAVE TO ASK FOR THEM OR PROCESS POUNDS. ON AND WE JUST BASICALLY WERE ABLE TO KIND OF STEP PEOPLE FORWARD. TO THE POINT WHERE NOW WE ARE BACK PROCESSING THERE IN A REDETERMINATION. IN THE MATTER HOW WORLD WAR NOT DISCONTINUING ANYONE OFF THE PROGRAM AND ARE NOT- PROCESSING ANNUAL REDETERMINATION PAPERWORK THAT WE RECEIVED. SO THERE'S SOME DIFFERENCES ACROSS THE PROGRAMS AND AS WE THINK ABOUT. PLANNING TOGETHER FOR WHAT HAPPENS IN THE FUTURE HOST PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY- WHICH OF COURSE WE HOPE THAT THEY COME SOONER RATHER THAN LATER BUT NOBODY REALLY KNOWS. INVOLVING THE COUNTY AND- IN THAT PLANNING SO THAT WE CAN. SHARE INFORMATION ABOUT WHEN. A PARTICULAR CHOICE THAN POLICY MIGHT RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN WORKLOAD. OR PRESENT CHALLENGES HER INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS OR POTENTIALLY RESULT IN DISPARATE TREATMENT ACROSS DIFFERENT GROUPS OF OUR RECIPIENT- WE EXPECT THAT TO BE INCLUDE YOU KNOW I'VE TO BE INCLUDED AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO THAT. BUT REALLY WANT TO SORT OF HIT HOME THAT WE WANT TO- INCLUDED AS AS WE HAVE BEEN. IN THAT PLANNING- AND ALSO TRY TO DO THAT PLANNING TO THE GREATEST EXTENT POSSIBLE ACROSS THE PROGRAMS. THAT WE OPERATE BOTH CALFRESH AND HOW WORK YOUR FOR TV AT THAT. AS WELL AS MEDICARE FOR EACH YEAH- I KNOW THAT'S OUT OF THE PURVIEW SENDING. SERVICES BUT A NUMBER OF THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ALSO- ARE MEMBERS OF THE HEALTH OR BUDGET COMMITTEES. ALSO BORDER- WITH I- BOB YOUR STATE YOU. AGAIN FOR THE- AND THEY YOU TO YOU OUT FOR THE FOURTH. THAT HAS OUT. TO COUNTY IS THE TOP AND WHICH THEY'RE IN. THE AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY THAT THEY COME UP. THANK YOU CAPITA PER.

NETWORKS AND MARCH OF TWENTY NINETEEN OUR AGENCY PARTNERS HAVE EXPERIENCED A ROUGHLY 50% INCREASE AND CLIENTS ACCESSING YOUR SERVICES WITH 25% OF THE CLIENT HAVING NEVER NEEDED TO ACCESS THE EMERGENCY FOOD NETWORK BEFORE THE PANDEMIC STRUCK. SO WHAT THIS IS DONE AND IT HAS HIGHLIGHTED THE VULNERABILITY OF A LARGE PORTION OF OUR POPULATION TO WHAT WE CALL EPISODIC INSECURITY AND PEOPLE FINDING THEMSELVES NEEDED THEY NEED A TAX THE EMERGENCY COULD NOT WORK I NEED YOU TO THAT PANDEMIC AND ECONOMIC RECORD QUESTIONS WHICH ARE REALLY. BEYOND THEIR CONTROL. THREE THINGS. SPIKE IN THE AND COUNTY THIRD AREA THANKS MARC. WE'VE ALSO BEEN EXTRA. DELAYED LIGHTS AND CHALLENGE AND NATIONALLY IT WAS BECAUSE END OF THE PLAN AND- CANNAGROW.

IN CHAU CABLE FIVE WE NEED THOUGHT AND A THIRD AND- FRESH PRODUCE AND FROM FARMERS AGRA.

I WISH I COULD SAY THE SECOND HAD IMPROVED- YOU KNOW THANK THANK YOU START OF THE CANDY ABOUT WE ARE PRETTY PRESS ON THE SUPPLY CHAIN IS AND- OUR ABILITY. TO PURCHASE AND RECEIVE AND A TIMELY MANNER SO WE HAVE- DELIVERY UNDERSTOOD NO LAW THAN MY WE EXPERIENCED IN THE PAST SO WE CASH HAND RIGHT NOW. AND TO BE ABLE ORDER AND% ORDER THE DOUBLE AND HAS A THAT WE'RE GOING TO NEED MEET THE NEEDS TO MEET THE FUTURE NEEDS I'M FAR FOR OUR CLIENT CARE AGENCY. NETWORK IN WE CAN. I SEE LOWER THAN NORMAL AND DONATE. FROM THE- YEAH. THIRD CHALLENGE CONTINUE. AND SOME OTHER SHALL THAT WE NEXT BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC AND DECREASED BY THE ASTON CALIFORNIA THANKS AND OUR PARTNERS AND OUR ARE CONTINUING TO EXPERIENCE VOLUNTEER SHORTAGES AT THE PANDEMIC CONTINUES- ON A PATH TO BE IMPLEMENTED BOTH AND UR DISTRIBUTION PARTNER AND- OUR AGENCY PARTNER NETWORKS ARE LIMITING. AND YOU KNOW VOLUNTEERS TO BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN SOCIAL DOCTRINE THING AND YOU KNOW PROPER HEALTH AND SAFETY PROTOCOLS. AND A REALLY INTERESTING FACT AT LEAST WITH OUR AT PARTNER NETWORK IT IS- WE HAVE A WE HAVE A LOT OF THE OLDER ADULTS THAT ARE THE ONES THAT ARE VOLUNTEERING THEIR TIME AND TO EXECUTE YOUNG WOMAN DEEP THEIR DISTRIBUTION NETWORK AT OUR AGENCY PARTNER PANTRIES AND THEY CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE WITH HEALTH AND SAFETY CONCERNS AND SO. I DRIVE BALL AND CHEER- POOL HAS HAS REALLY CONSTRUCTED A WALL AND BECAUSE RELYING ON VOLUNTEERS TO BE ABLE TO EXECUTE OUR WORK IT'S BEEN CHALLENGING AS FIFTY AND AN INCREASED NEED BUT A DECREASE AND VOLUNTEERS. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE DID ON TO BE ABLE TO. TAX CUTS A BATTLE. ON THAT CHANNEL AND I KNOW MANY COULD BRING THE DEMOCRATS IT'S HAD TODAY I VERY EARLY DRIVE YOU'RE JUST TO BE. AND WE I OF COURSE YOU NEED A LOWER AMOUNT OF ON TO BE TO ACCESS THOSE TRY YOU'RE JUST. AND THEN WE- INTERNAL A LOT OF OUR AND ALLOW OF OUR AGENCY I. AND STARTED AT PRE PACKAGING. AND OUR WAREHOUSE AND TO BE ABLE TO THE AND YOU ARE ALREADY DONE HOPEFULLY THAT RELEASED FROM CHALLENGE IN OUR AGENCY PART NETWORK. I DON'T WANT TO BE UNEMPLOYED IN THE LATER COVER HAVE. I THINK YOU HEARD AT. THE END OF THE CALL A LITTLE BIT EARLY. AND BY BUT FOR TO BEING REALLY SHOW. AND UNEMPLOYMENT CAL. AND I'M GOING TO. INTO MY CRATE- AND TELL. YOU KNOW TWENTY TWENTY TWO TO TWO TWENTY. AND A LOT OF THAT REALLY DEPENDS ON WHETHER TAXI AS AND- ON. SIX ACTUALLY DISTRIBUTE WITHIN THE NEXT YEAR- AND SO FOOD. REALLY ARAMBULA SAYING. FOR AND YOU KNOW ALAMEDA SERVICE LEVELS. FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS THIS ISN'T SOMETHING THAT- THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT WITHOUT WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO RESOLVE IN THE NEXT YEAR AND SO WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO INTERNALLY FIGURE OUT. HOW ARE WE ALLOCATING RESOURCES HOW ARE WE CAN FIND OUT ON YOUR RESOURCE. ARE AVAILABLE TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO EXECUTE THE ELEVATED LEVEL SUPPORT. AND THEN I THINK. THAT YOU KNOW AN ADDITIONAL COMPLICATING FACTOR AT LEAST FOR THE CENTRAL VALLEY. IS THAT WE TEND TO LAG BEHIND THE REST OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN TERMS OF OUR OUR RECOVERY AND OUR UNEMPLOYMENT NUMBERS. WE FACE- WE FACE SOME ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY THAT MAYBE DOESN'T NEAR. AND THE RATE OF RECOVERY. FOR THE REST OF THE STATE. SO BECAUSE THE PROBATE BECAUSE OF THE CHALLENGES YOU KNOW CHRIS BY CAN DOWN THE WE'VE HAD BE NUMBER WE'VE HAD TO CREATE A- CAR. AND CARTER. WITH NEW PARTNERS TO BE TO MEET THE NEEDS I'M START. WHEN AT PROVIDING HER TESTING EARLIER SHE- THAT ACTS COURSE TO GO. GROCERY GO WITHIN PROGRAM IT'S A POINT BASED. THAT LOCATED AT OUR FEET. SERVING TO FOUR THOUSAND HOW. PER MONTH THEN THEY GET ONE. HELPFUL ARE ACTUALLY BEING SERVICE VIA DELIVER SO ARE. WITH THE DELIVERY PARTNER. IN. PROVIDING ADDITIONAL ONE THOUSAND. AD BOXES PER MONTH. THAT ARE. AND HOME INDIVIDUALS. AND WITHIN THE MONTH WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO BE A- THE GROWTH PICKUP. INTO TWELVE ADELAIDE LOCATION AND I WORK. I'M WE WON'T BE IN KERN WILL BE ACT AND- CARD NUMBER THERE ARE. KING COUNTY AND THIS IS TO BE ABLE TO. D. AND THAT ACCESS CHALLENGE AT THE END. TO HAS I'M TRANSIT. OR DOESN'T HAVE BACK ON. I'M COME PICK UP THE FOOD AT THE COULD BE FOR THAT GROCERY TO GO TO WORK WITHOUT THE WORLD. BURKE TO REDUCE SOME OF THE DAY. THAT WITH TRANSPORT. AND EXECUTE- TEST ABOUT A SITES CHARGING ACCESS. WE AND WE ALSO AND- OR CHILD PROGRAMS AND THE PARTNERED WITH- PRESS UNIFIED AND OR GOLD THIS. THE PRESIDENT. AS THE BRANCH AND SCHOOL. RIGHT NOW WE'RE COULD BOX THAT THIRTEEN WOLF. ITS FIGHT. AND EIGHT- OR AND CRIED KNOWING. OR DISTRICT WHERE HIGH ALL- OR KNOW LIKE THE BACK TO BACK THAT MY TURN ARE NOT CURRENTLY BEING. WE ARE WORKING TO EXPAND AND. THOSE PARTNERSHIPS. I NEED TO ONE ST CHANT THAT. AND SOMETHING ELSE THAT WE TRY TO ADDRESS BECAUSE LET HIM DOWN IS- ACCESS ASSET ACCESS FOR FORMER POPULATION. AND WE REALIZE THAT- YOU KNOW DAT THAT THANKS AND OUR AGENCY PARTNERS TYPICALLY HAVE SOME RESTRICTIONS OR LIMITATIONS WHEN WE ARE ACTUALLY LIKE EXECUTING COULD DISTRIBUTIONS THAT MAYBE DON'T ALLOW FARMWORKERS TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS THAT. AND SO WE'RE PARTNERING UP- WHAT SHEGOT BACK AND YOUR W. FOUNDATION TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE FARMWORKERS AND THEIR FAMILIES WITH INCREASED ACCESS TO RESOURCES THAT NEED THAT WERE ACTUALLY I'M YOU KNOW PARTNERING WITH WITH YOUR W. M. YEAH AND WE ARE ANDO'S FARMER CAN COMMUNITIES WERE DOING- DISTRIBUTION THAT TIME APPROPRIATE TIME WHEN FARMWORKERS CAN ACCESS. I DON'T RIGHT WE ARE PROVIDING CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE FOOD AND THEN THE LAST- PROGRAMMING BUT I WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT WAS AND COMMUNITY MEDICAL CENTERS HOME HEALTH PARTNERSHIP AND THIS IS A COLLABORATION WITH- HOME HEALTH NURSES TO BE ABLE TO FEED I DISABLED AND HOMEBOUND I INDIVIDUALS AND WE ACTUALLY GOT AN ADDITIONAL GRANT FUNDING WE'RE GOING TO BE EXTENDING THAT. PARTNERSHIP OVER THE NEXT FOURTEEN MONTHS. SO THAT'S A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOU KNOW HAPPENING CENTRAL. AND CREEPING SPECIFIC BUT TO HIRE THAT SOME OF THAT YOU KNOW OR CONDITIONS OUR CREAKING CENTRAL CALIFORNIA ARE SHE- BY THE OTHER FOR TWO MY- OF THE CAL. ASSOCIATION OF FOOD BANKS AND HELP THIRTY AT THE BANK- HAVE BEEN- INTEGRAL AND HELPING US- YOU KNOW TAKE CARE FUNDING AND- PROVIDE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO YOU KNOW TO OUR COMMUNITY.

AN AGRICULTURAL REGION ARE STRENGTHENING OUR CAPACITY TO ENSURE FARMWORKERS AND THEIR FAMILIES HAVE ACCESS TO ADEQUATE FOOD DRINKS- THAT NINETEEN AND BEYOND. AND THE SAYS THAT COULD ACCESS FOR FARMWORKERS AND **** AND BASICALLY FOOD BANKS ARE USING THEIR OWN LOCAL MODELS AND QUICKER SHIFTING INTO ADDITIONAL FOOD AS I MENTIONED WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH THE AFTERMATH W. WE ARE SHIFTING DISTRIBUTION TIMES AND LOCATIONS FOR SUPPLEMENTING OUR STAFF TO BETTER REACH FARM WORKING COMMUNITY. AND WE THINK THAT THIS IS DOESN'T VITAL WORK BECAUSE- AND THOSE COMMUNITIES ARE EXPERIENCING SOME OF THE HIGHEST RATES OF HUNGER YEAH THEY'RE FEEDING YOU KNOW THE COUNTRY IF NOT THE WORLD AND SO WE REALLY. AND YOU KNOW ARE ARE VERY SERIOUS ABOUT MAKING INVESTMENTS ON MAKING SURE THAT YOU KNOW OUR OUR FARMWORKERS. ARE A TEACHER AT. AND THEN ALSO TO HAVE THAT THAT RECENT CURRENT SURELY. AND OTHER ADDITIONAL STATE RE ALEX. HAVE BEEN. AND HOW. BANKS INCREASE OUR LEVEL OF SERVICE. THANK YOU TO ENSURE HER. THE SENATE ALLEGE. AS FOR FIRST FIVE EIGHTH.

AND YOU KNOW FIRST OUR DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS ENSURE CONTROL TO PASS AFTER THE STATE. AND YOU KNOW IT'S EXPANDED ON THAT AND NOT DEADLINE. I'M STUNNED FACT AND ONE OF OUR PRIMARY FOCUS AS THE CULTURALLY COMPETENT- BUT WHERE. THROUGH FEEDBACK LOOPS YOU KNOW HOW MY CLIENTS OR AGENCY PARTNER NETWORK- I'M MORE ALSO ALSO PURCHASING I'M AND CAN FORMULATE SHOULD BE ABLE TO MEET A VERY SPECIFIC. ISSUE THAT HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED DURING THE PANDEMIC. AND THE- POPULATION. AND LASTLY WE ABOUT EARLIER- THINK YOU KNOW ABOUT ALL OF US CAN THAT THAT. REALLY SHOWS NO SIGN OF. BUT IS GOING TO BE AND AS FEDERAL COURT AND- FEDERAL SUPPORT FOR THE PREPREG- AND WE ARE FOOD OUR GOING TO FACING A VERY REAL SCREWED CLASS- ON THE THIRD FIRST SO THERE'S A TYPICALLY CHEAPER. I SUPPLEMENTAL PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN HELD AND REALLY HOT AND ALLOW YOU COULD BE BONTA NEED THE FIRST ONE IS I TREAT MEDICATION. AND DIE IT MEANS AND HELP WE'RE GOING. I ABOUT E. TWELFTH MILLION ONE COUNT A DEAL SPECIFIC THROUGH TRUE TRADE MEDICAID- FOR THAT HAS BEEN- SHOPS. AND PERSONAL I LIKE- SHEETS ARE CLEAN ARE REALLY REALLY GOT WE NEED MORE DIET.

THANK VICTORIA DOES OF BRING THE CAR THE DISCUSSION TO THE MAIN- TO HAVE ANY ANY. RECALL FROM. COMMITTEE MEMBERS. OKAY HAVE EIGHT. OF FOR THIS PAN LIGHT I KNOW THERE WAS A- BIT OF- MENTION OF CULTURALLY- RELEVANT IF YOU KNOW WOOD NUTRITION PROGRAMS CAN. CAN ANYBODY ELSE SPEAK TO THE PROGRAM SAID THAT- YOU'VE IMPLEMENTED. TOTAL VICTORIA- I CAN SPEAK TO IT. SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE DO AT AREA AGENCIES ON AGING IF WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. THAT WERE SERVING IN YOU KNOW CULTURE APPROPRIATE. FOR THE POPULATION THAT WE'RE SERVING AND SO WHEN WE LOOK AT WHAT IS. IT HILLARD'S TO THE COMMUNITY THAT WERE SERVING IT TOO. AND YOU KNOW WHEN WE LOOK FOR RESTAURANT PARTNERS TO HELP- WE ARE LOOKING FOR. YOU KNOW RESTAURANTS THAT NEED A LOT OF THEM ARE MORE LOCAL RESTAURANTS IN THAT LOCAL. YOU KNOW COMMUNITIES SO WE'RE NOT BRINGING IN FROM OTHER COMMUNITIES THAT MAY NOT BE WHAT PEOPLE. KNOW YOUR BILL. TO THE INDIVIDUAL AND WE ALSO DO A LOT OF SERVE AS WELL TO MAKE SURE THAT. WHAT WE'RE SERVING IS WHAT PEOPLE WANT. THANK YOU VICTORIA M. MY NEXT QUESTIONS FOR LIKE IT'S FOR LEXUS FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP- THE CALPERS PROGRAM HAS BEEN AT THE FRONT LINES OF THE FIGHT AGAINST HUNGER AND ENERGY AND DEDICATION YOU BRING TO THE PROGRAM IS JUST REALLY APPRECIATED. I'M CHRISTIAN ORDER SOME OF THE LESSONS LEARNED IN THE PAST THREE MONTHS AND WHAT ARE SOME OF THE FUTURE CHALLENGES THAT YOUR CONSTITUENTS CONCERNED ABOUT. THIS IS A BIT YOU COULD HAVE A THESIS ON LESSONS LEARNED. I THINK. IT'S CLEAR THAT. WHAT WE SEE IN OUR CASELOAD IS A REFLECTION OF THE DEPTH OF THE NEEDS THAT PEOPLE ARE EXPERIENCING AND SO- IT IS CLEAR THAT CALFRESH PLAYS A CRITICAL ROLE IN HELPING TO MEET NEEDS AND- ENSURING THAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THAT CULTURALLY COMPETENT OF FOOD ACCESS WHEN YOU HAVE BENEFITS THAT YOU CAN USE AT A STORE YOU'RE ABLE TO MAKE THOSE CHOICES AND SO TOGETHER WITH OTHER RESOURCES THAT'S HOW WE HELP. PEOPLE MEET THEIR NEEDS IN A WAY THAT- SATISFIED SATISFIED THINGS LIKE CULTURAL DIFFERENCES I THINK IT DEFINITELY IT'S CLEAR THAT WE PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN- ECONOMIC RECOVERY AT THE INDIVIDUAL LEVEL AND AT THE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL IN TERMS OF BUSINESS SUPPORT I THINK WE LEARNED ON THE ADMINISTRATIVE SIDE THAT- THERE ARE POSSIBILITIES THAT HELPED US RESPOND AND YOU KNOW IF WE COULD ASK- AS A KHAKI SUIT SUGGESTION FOR IMPROVEMENTS AND WHAT'S AVAILABLE IT'S AROUND THE CONSISTENCY RIGHT. FOR A LONG TIME WE WERE ASKING FOR FLEXIBILITY IS ON A MONTH TO MONTH BASIS WHICH DIDN'T ALLOW US TO REALLY PLAN LONG TERM AND THINK ABOUT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE TO RESPOND TO AN ONGOING DISASTER OF THIS MAGNITUDE GREAT THAT IS BOUND TO LAST FOR THE NEXT YEAR OR SO WELL WE JUST IMPLEMENTED FOR EXAMPLE INTERVIEW FLEXIBILITIES ALL THE WAY THROUGH JIM. THAT PROVIDE NOT ONLY A STABILITY FOR CLIENTS BUT ALSO FOR COUNTY PARTNERS IN BEING ABLE TO PLAN TO THAT TYPE OF ADMINISTRATIVE RELIEF SO THAT THE MONTH TO MONTH WORK THAT WE HAD TO DO WITH OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS. WAS VERY VERY CHALLENGING. TO SAY THE AND WE'RE FOR TO SOME. IN IN THOSE OPTION BEING A BILL- AND- THE- ADDRESSING THE BENEFIT ADEQUACY BUT LOTS OF LESSONS LEARNED FOR PANDEMIC. THAT WAS A BRAND NEW PROGRAM RIGHT WE HAD IT WAS UNPRECEDENTED. NO NO STATE HAD DONE THAT RIGHT WE DID NOT HAVE KIND OF A- ALL OF THE INFORMATION WE HAVE NOW TO ENSURE THAT WHEN WE GO OUT FOR THIS NEXT ROUND FOR AN ENTIRE SCHOOL YEAR. WE ARE BETTER EQUIPPED TO MEET. THE NEEDS OF FAMILIES NOT ONLY IN TERMS OF GETTING CARDS OUT BUT FOR EXAMPLE- MAKING SURE THEY UNDERSTAND HOW TO USE BENEFITS THEY MAY NOT BE ON CALPERS IS MAYBE THE FIRST EBT CARD THAT THEY HAD AND SO WE LEARNED A LOT EVEN ABOUT SOME. BASIC COMMUNICATIONS AND MESSAGING THAT WILL APPLY TO THIS FUTURE OPERATION SO I THINK THERE ARE QUITE A FEW CAN LOOK ACROSS A BROAD RANGE BUT- TAKING THOSE NOW AND APPLYING THEM. TO THE YEAR AHEAD IS WHERE WE'RE- PARTNERS. THANK YOU ALEXIS SENT OUT MY NEXT QUESTION- THIS IS FOR NATALIE- YOU KNOW FIRST OF ALL WHAT ON BEHALF OF OUR COMMUNITY- I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE WORK YOU'RE DOING A TO FEED THE PEOPLE OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND- YOU KNOW I'M I'M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE FOOD CLIFF AND I HOPE THAT THE FEDERAL SYSTEMS WILL BE FORTHCOMING BUT- AND I WANT YOU. TO FEEL FREE TO ALWAYS KEEP US INFORMED AS- YOU KNOW THINGS DEVELOP. I WAS HOPING YOU COULD GIVE US A LITTLE BIT MORE OF. INFORMATION IN. THE EVENT AND THAT PARTNERSHIP THAT YOU HAVE. THAT THAT WAS BUILT BETWEEN THE- BETWEEN. YOU KNOW AG AND THE FOOD BANK AND UP ABOUT A POTENTIAL WAYS THAT YOU YOU SEE THAT WE COULD YOU KNOW FURTHER WORK DOWN THE ROAD TOGETHER- TO JUSTICE THIS FOOD INSECURITY IN IN. CALIFORNIA YEAH I DEFINITELY. AGREE WITH THE- THE PHYSICALLY WHAT HE ASKED FORMER CORONATION. WE AND WE HAVE SOME LONG STANDING RELATIONSHIPS WITH U. S. W. AND PREACHER LEAD AND SO. THEY'VE BEEN REALLY INTEGRAL AND- HELPING PROVIDE SUPPORT- AND EFFICIENTLY GETTING DISTRIBUTION BATTLES FARM WORKING COMMUNITIES YOU KNOW ASK THE DOCTORS LIKE THESE ARISE. AND I THINK THAT THAT. I THINK THAT THEY TIRED THE TETHER BETWEEN YOU KNOW FOOD BANKS AND OUR AGRICULTURAL COMMUNITY AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY NEEDS TO BE STRENGTHENED I THINK THAT. YOU KNOW I THINK THAT THE PANDEMIC HIGHLIGHTED. SOME SOME AREAS OF OCT AND GROWTH AND WE CAN GO STRENGTH OUR COPER YOU KNOW WE HEARING FROM. YOU AT AND YEAH THAT AND YOU KNOW THE TIME OF DISTRICT TO JUST WORK FOR OUR OR THEY DIDN'T HAVE ACCESS TO TRANSPORT. YOU KNOW TO GET TO THE DISTRICT BY WAR AND- YOU KNOW MAYBE AS IT WAS A THE MAY OF THE COMMODITIES THAT WE WERE. THAT THEY NEEDED AND YOU KNOW DIFFERENT VARIATION OF THE ITEM SO INSTEAD AND- YOU KNOW NONPERISHABLE PANTRY SHELF STABLE ITEMS THAT THEY WERE ALREADY I'M BUYING IN BULK LIKE RIGHT THIRTEEN THEY NEED ACCESS TO GEHRY A TORTILLA- G. AND SO WE ARE REALLY I AM. REALLY LOOKING AT TO CREATE A STRENGTHENS- AND REALLY FALL INTO FEEDBACK LOOP AND SO THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED THAT'S WHAT WORKING WITH OUR AGRICULTURAL PARTNERS THAT'S WHAT WE'RE WORKING WITH ANIMATION YOU KNOW LIKE THE ABOUT THE UFW DOES IS THEY HAVE. TO TRY AND DO THAT AND TO TRUST THEM ACCENTS OF BE- INDIVIDUALS AND DAY. YOU KNOW OUR OUR FARMWORKERS ARE ARE MORE WILLING TO TALK TO THEM AND EXPRESS THEIR NEEDS AND CONCERNS AND THEIR CHALLENGES SH THEN THEY ARE YOU KNOW JANET JACKSON BANKS UNFORTUNATELY WE'RE STILL SEEN OUR- WE'RE NOT KEEPING UP WITH A SEPARATE YOU KNOW NONPROFIT ENTITY WERE SEEN YOU KNOW AS- PART OF AYE AYE A COG IN THE GOVERNMENT NETWORK AND SO THERE IS STILL TIME TO. STICK AND FEAR AND HOW THEY ARE COMMUNICATING AND HOW THEY'RE THEY'RE INTERFACING. AND TO REALLY FINDING- ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAD THAT THE TRUST AND THE COMMUNITY IS A VITAL PART IN HOW WE. INCREASE ACT THAT. AND I HOPE THAT ANSWERS QUESTION. THANK YOU THANK YOU. SO A COUPLE MORE PLEASE BERMAN ME EVERY AT THE YOU- SOMEONE QUESTION FOR RIDE I ANOTHER MANY COMMUNITY IN WHICH THE GREAT PLAY PROGR. IS NOT AVAILABLE- WHAT KIND OF WORK IS HAPPENING TO EXPAND THE OF UP THE GREAT PROGRAM AT IN THESE COME. ARE GREAT SIZE. SHARE WE STILL CONTINUE TO- CALL OKAY WEDNESDAY WE HAVE OUR- MEETINGS WITHOUT THAT COMPANIES AND CITIES AND WE ENCOURAGE PARTICIPATION ADDITIONALLY- MYSELF AND OTHER LEADERS HERE AT OUR HOUSE WE DO STAY IN CONSTANT CONTACT WITH THE COUNTY LEADERS TO ENCOURAGE PARTICIPATION AND- PARTICULARLY NOW THAT WE HAVE FORTY ONE COUNTIES IN THE PURPLE. A TIER STATUS WE'RE CONTINUING TO REACH OUT TO CALL THEM DIRECTLY TO SEE WHAT- WHAT WOULD. THEY HAVE BEEN MORE IMPORTANT. WHY ARE THEY- AGAINST INTO THE PROGRAM A LOT OF TIMES IT'S JUST STOP MISINFORMATION- HOW THE PROGRAM WORKS- BUT IN MANY CASES IT IS BOB FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE AND- WE ARE ALLOWING- THROUGH. OTHER PUBLIC ASSISTANCE PROCESS THROUGH THE FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION FEMA- WE'RE ALLOWED TO ADVANCE PEOPLE- IN BALGOWNIE IN CITIES MONIES UP FOR THAT SO WE'RE IN CONSTANT CONTACT. WITH OUR COMMUNITIES- IT WE HAVE A GREAT PARTNERSHIP WITH THE- TRIP AWAY THAT DOING A GREAT OUTRAGE CAMPAIGN FOR US- THIS. B. THERE IS NO DEADLINE OF WIND STRUVITE JOINED- YOU CAN JOIN TODAY- YOU KNOW THERE IS ONE VERY WE HAVE IS EVERY THIRTY DAYS WE HAVE TO GET EXTENDED OF COURSE WE ACCESS TO BE EXTENDED EVERY THIRTY SIXTY NINETY DAYS WE ONLY GET A THIRTY DAY EXTENSION- THAT SEEMS TO BE ONE AREA THAT WE HAVE TO OVERCOME WITH THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS BUT- WE'RE CURRENTLY.

BY OCTOBER NINETEEN SO THE OUTRAGE CONTINUES AND IF THERE'S ANYTHING THAT WE CAN DO MORE- WILL BE. GLAD TO PARTICIPATE NOT. IT AND SO WHAT THE OTHER QUESTION- WHAT IS PRO. OF A TO REST PURCHASE A IN AND THE- GREAT PLACE. ARE THESE LIKE MOM AND POP SHOPS OR THE TYPICALLY CHAIN RESTAURANTS. I THINK IT'S A MIXTURE OF BOTH THEN MAYBE THINGS ARE YOU CAN EVEN SHOP AND I KNOW- WE DO HAVE 58% OF OUR RESTAURANT PROVIDERS ARE MINORITY OWNED WHICH IS- BIG FOR ALL OF US PARTICULARLY FOR THE CULTURAL. ASPECT OF THIS- AND- IT'S WHAT'S BEEN A WIDE MAJORITY OF MOM AND POP STORES WE DID TARGET AT THE BEGINNING TO MAKE SURE THAT IT WAS MORE ABOUT SMALL BUSINESS. OUTSIDE RESTAURANTS AND NOT THE LARGE ARENAS- WE'RE TRYING TO GET- THERE'S PEOPLE THAT DO NOT HAVE THAT- MECHANISM- OR YOU KNOW BASE- TO COME BACK TO WORK SO- SERVER CITIES HAVE BEEN TARGETING THOSE SMALLER MOM AND POP RESTAURANTS AND- WE'VE BEEN CONSTANTLY RECEIVING- YEAH THANK YOU LETTERS ON OUR SIDE IN SEVERAL CITIES INCLUDING. SANGER AND- I SAVE UP EARLIER BEEN UP FOR DISSIPATING- AND I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S ALRIGHT IF YOU WANT I JUST TREMENDOUS DIFFERENCE. FOR US. SURE I WOULD HAPPY- MEN. SO IN AIR WOKE IT IS MAINLY AND POP. THERE MOL WE'RE BLESSED- THEY ALREADY OF THE- MOST OF THEM ARE MAJORITY OF OURS ARE- MINORITIES OR WOMAN OWNED. WHAT WHAT WE'VE IS THAT. THE COMMUNITY LOVE THEM BECAUSE IT'S NOT YOU KNOW NECESSARILY CHANGE MORE IN PLACE BUT THAT'S ANOTHER WAY- YOU KNOW THEY'VE PROVIDED A TREMENDOUS SERVICE FOR US AND. I LIKE THIS PROGRAM IF THEY COULD CONTINUE LONG TERM. IT WOULD IT WOULD MAKE ME HAPPY BUT IT NEARLY A REAL NEED IN OUR COMMUNITY WHEN WE LOOK AT YOU KNOW RYAN MENTIONED YOU KNOW THE NUMBER OF JOBS IN THOSE ARE BOTH WANTED NUMBERS THOSE ARE REAL PEOPLE THAT WOULD BE WITHOUT A JOB IF IT WEREN'T THAT. PROGRAM I GET. YOU KNOW. NOTICE YOU KNOW PROBABLY EVERY TWO WEEKS FOR A LAST SAYING YOU HAVE SAVED OUR BUSINESS PROGRAM BUT THIS PROGRAM DIDN'T EXIST WE WOULD HAVE BEEN OUT OF BUSINESS AND LIKE. APRIL MAY. THANK YOU VICTOR AND I THE REASON I'M YOU KNOW ASKING IF YOU CAN ELABORATE ON THIS I MEAN. IF THERE'S THINGS THAT THAT THE TURRET COUNTY IS DOING THAT THAT. IT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S VERY SUCCESSFUL FOR VENTURA COUNTY WHAT MEAN WHAT'S THE ADVICE FOR THE OTHER COUNTIES- TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN- GIVE SAVE THOSE THOSE MOM AND POP SHOPS AS WELL AND THAT PEOPLE FEEL COMFORTABLE GOING TO PARK YOU. KNOW GETTING FOOD FROM THE PLACES THAT THE YOU KNOW THE RESTAURANTS AT THE TRUST- AND OBVIOUSLY THERE'S ALWAYS ROOM AND NEED FOR EXPANDING- PARTICIPATION SO. IF YOU HAVE ANY ADVICE FOR YOU KNOW FOR OTHER COUNTIES ON. WHAT'S BEEN THAT WHAT'S BEEN SUCCESSFUL FOR PRINTER ACCOUNTED. PLEASE GREATLY. SO I THINK OUR OUR PROCESS. YEAH I THINK ACROSS THE STATE WE SET UP. BOTTOM OF THE GETTING- WE WORK WITH OUR- OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES. AND WE LOOKED AT. YOU KNOW HAVING THEM DO THE COMMITMENT FOR RESTAURANT SURE THAT IT WAS A FAIR- WE TALKED EXECUTIVE I. PART OF THE. SHARE THEIR INTEREST IN THE WHOLE. YOU KNOW RETAINING BUSINESS SO THEY PUT OUT THE FOR THEIR NETWORK BUT THAT THERE WAS A FAIR YOU CAN OF EVERYBODY TO. AND THEN WE AT ALL OF THE APPS THAT YOU CAN WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT DIDN'T HAVE CULTURALLY UPON WHAT ON IT WILL REFLECT IN THE BEGINNING AND SO. YOU KNOW WE CHOSE THE- CARE TO MAKE SURE THAT. WE WERE. IN THOSE PEOPLE THAT WOULD TO CALL IT DIDN'T WORK THAT- THE OTHER THING IS IT IS YOU KNOW. WHY BRIEFLY MY THAT BUT ONE OF THE THINGS TO CONSIDER IF THE WE'RE TRYING TO YOU KNOW A ON THE- IS THAT. THERE IS A LOT MATCH REQUIRED. AND I KNOW IT SOME AREAS THE MAP OF WHAT HAS BEEN A- FOR. MANY PEOPLE PARTICIPATE. AND FAR FROM VENTURA WE'VE BEEN IN OUR COUNTING OFFICES PROVIDED YOU KNOW WITH THE WITH THE. AS A MATTER WHICH IS. BUT NOT ALL. MANAGERS MAY HAVE THAT. YOU THEY DON'T GET THE FEDERAL EXPANSION ON THE- CARADOC THE COMPANY COUNTY THAT EXPIRES ON DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST- YOU KNOW THAT MADE CHANGES THE VIABILITY OF THE PROGRAM. THANK YOU THAT'S VERY HELPFUL I MEAN THAT THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'VE HEARD IS THAT THERE'S FEAR IN. YOU KNOW THE FOR HAVING A MATCH. THE FUNDS AND THEN. AT THE END OF THE DAY NOT BEING ABLE TO. GET THAT REIMBURSEMENT BOB BACK. AND I KNOW THERE WAS ALSO MENTION OF THE TWO COMMUNITIES THAT. YOU'RE PARTICULARLY IN MY AREA. OF SINGAPORE LEE AND I WAS LOOKING AT THE NUMBERS- SO FOR EXAMPLE THE CITY OF PARLEY AIR. THE NUMBER OF MEALS SERVED SINCE THE PROGRAM LAUNCHED WELL AS- IS 303-800-0200 FIFTY. NUMBER OF ELIGIBLE PARTICIPANTS BEING SERVED IS TWO HUNDRED THIRTY. NUMBER OF RESTAURANTS CURRENTLY PARTICIPATING IN THIS TWELFTH- YOU KNOW FOR SMALL COMMUNITY EIGHTY EIGHT YEAR TWELVE IS PRETTY GOOD- YOU KNOW AND YOU LOOK COMPARISON TO. THE NEIGHBORING- COMMUNITY HUB CITY SINGER AND THE COMMUNITY I LIVE IN ITS THIRTY ONE THOUSAND ELEVEN AT. A NUMBER OF MEALS SERVED SINCE THE PROGRAM LAUNCHED- NUMBER OF ELIGIBLE PARTICIPANTS ONE ON ONE A NUMBER OF RESTAURANTS CURRENTLY PARTICIPATING ONE AND SO JUST LOOKING AT SOME OF THE NUMBERS AND JUST YOU KNOW THE- JUST LOOKING AT WHAT ARE SOME OF THE CHALLENGES HOW CAN WE GET MORE RESTAURANTS YOUR PARTICIPATING. YOU KNOW HOW CAN WE GET- THE END OF NUMBER OF MEALS SERVED AT EIGHT DO YOU KNOW TO BE MORE TO BE OUT YOU KNOW TO MAKE SURE THAT THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS GET IT IN. AND IT JUST SEEMS. THERE'S SOME WORK THAT WE COULD DO AND I THINK THAT YOUR INPUT TODAY IS VERY HELPFUL AND IF THERE'S ANYTHING ELSE YOU'D LIKE TO ADD PLEASE FEEL FREE. I'M SURE THIS IS NOW I WOULD. ALL RIGHT. I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT NO I WOULD JUST SAY THAT- YOU KNOW THEY'RE THEY'RE- LOCAL IF YOU'RE TRYING TO INCREASE PARTICIPATION ESPECIALLY IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY- IN AREAS THAT ARE REALLY HARD HIT WITH COLEMAN- YOU KNOW IT I THINK IT MAY TAKE SOME WORK BUT IT IS NOT GOING TO HAVE TO BE A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN. THEIR LOCAL OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES AT EITHER THIRTY OR THE TRIP AWAY IN THAT AREA. STEPPING UP TO BECOME LIKE THE LOCAL ADMINISTRATOR YOU KNOW WORKING WITH. YOU KNOW RYAN AUTHORS WHO'VE BEEN YOU KNOW HAS BEEN GREAT THERE HASN'T BEEN ANY DELAY THE PAYMENT. OF THE PAPERWORK REQUIRED AND NOT LIKE ALCOHOL OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT IT SHOULD BE. YOU KNOW IN WHAT. THEY WANT OTHER BARRIER. TO PARTICIPATING I THINK IT'S JUST SETTING SOMETHING UP LOCAL IF NOT. THE BACKEND OF THE REIMBURSEMENT. SO IF YOU IF YOU WERE TO TALK ON LINE NEEDS IN THE STARTING THING AT THE TO GET A- FEEL FREE TO CONTACT ME. ABSOLUTELY I THINK. THAT AND UP RIGHT DID YOU HAVE A CALM. YES I DID I JUST WANNA- REALLY EMPHASIZE WHAT SORRY JUST SAY TRULY AS KNOW- LOCAL STATE FEDERAL PROGRAM AT ITS BEST- MY TEAM HERE IT'S OH YES IS COMMITTED TO WORK WITH- THE LOCAL WIN A TRIP WHICH UNITIES AND PROVIDE THEM WHATEVER THEY NEED I WILL SAY SOME YOU KNOW ONE NOT NECESSARY BARRIER BUT IT IS A VERY PARTICULAR IN CENTER VALLEY AND OTHERS. SAID PLAY YOUR- YOU KNOW WHAT DISTRICT WE HAVE A LARGE. PORTION OF BEING SPEAKING- AGAIN. AND A LOT OF THOSE CITIES SEVEN ACTUALLY GO INTO THE LOCAL GROCERY STORES AND- AND IN OTHER PLACES WORK WHERE THEY CAN SEE PEOPLE ARE STRUGGLING TO SEE THE PURCHASE FOOD OR- ARE JUST GET OUT AND- THEY'VE BEEN BURKE AND- THE A CITY THAT SELLS ARE BRINGING TRANSLATORS- TO TRY TO PARTICIPATE AND THE ROLE IN THE PROGRAM AND I THINK THE MORE THAT WE GET OUT OF THAT. OUT OF REACH TO THE FINE AND DESIGN WITH THIS PROGRAM IS HOW IT ACTUALLY HELPS YOU HOW IT'S NO COST TO YOU- I THINK THEY'LL BE HUGE OUTBREAKS THERE'S BEEN SOME HUGE SUCCESS AS- A FROM CITIES. WE WENT OUT JUST THAT. AND OF COURSE WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO SHARE THOSE. I HAVE ONE MORE LAST QUESTION IT IT MAY BE A QUESTION THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE ABLE TO BE. ANSWERED BUT- JUST A- AND THINKING OF JUST THE- THAT WE HAVE. ENDED QUITE FRANKLY GET JUSTICE COULD TO GROW RIGHT IN TERMS OF INSECURITY I'M WONDERING IF THERE'S ANY INFORMATION FROM ANY. COLLECTED IN TERMS OF HOSPITALIZATIONS AND DOOR- DEATHS TO DO IT YES. BLACKFORD STARVATION. CAN ANYBODY COMMENT ON THAT. THE MANAGER I DON'T HAVE ANY STATS OF DOUBTS BUT I WILL SAY- WHEN WE WERE WORKING WITH CHS EARLIER IN MARCH TO DESIGN THIS FIRST EVER- PROGRAM NATIONALLY- ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS WE DID DESIGN ESTAS OTHER STATES DID WELLNESS CHECKS AND THEY WERE- IDENTIFYING PEOPLE THAT WERE ELDERLY THAT HAVE PASSED SO THAT HAS BEEN A DRIVER OF THE GREAT PLACE PROGRAMS IS JUST THAT HOW DO WE BEST ENSURE THAT- THE PEOPLE WITH THE MOST VULNERABLE THEY HAVE NO OTHER. OPTION FOR GETTING SAID- AND YOU KNOW THE FIFTY SIX DOLLARS AND A SHOW IN THE YOU KNOW SO INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE BEING FED- ARE NOT PART OF THAT SYSTEM STATE BANK I DON'T HAVE ANY SPECIFICS I CAN SAY THE DRIVER OF GRAVESITES. PROGRAM THAT WAS ONE OF THE MAIN DRIVERS. AND MADAM CHAIR KATHY CENTER IF I MIGHT ALSO. IN A THIS ONE FOR CW. I THINK- WHEN WE- TALK TO K. OF WHY. WHAT THEY WERE DOING AS FAR AS OUR REACH. IT WAS MAYBE NOT COMPLETELY ACROSS THE BOARD BUT NEARLY EVERY COUNTY THAT I WAS AWARE HAD A PROJECT ROOM KEY. PROGRAM WHICH OF COURSE IS- TARGETED AT SIMILAR STRUGGLING UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS HOMELESS POPULATIONS THAT WOULD. TYPICALLY BE VERY VULNERABLE TO ILLNESS- AND POTENTIAL THAT. ARE NOT JUST BECAUSE OF CALL GOOD GOOD BECAUSE OF OTHER JUST STRUCTURAL ISSUES- AS WELL DIE AND YOU KNOW AND A LACK OF HOUSING SUPPORT. THEY HAVE BEEN DOING THAT OUR REACH IN CONCERT WITH THE PROJECT ROOM KEY. PROGRAMS TO TRY TO BRING THE SERVICES FOR EXAMPLE GET THE INDIVIDUAL SIGNED UP FOR CALFRESH. CONNECT THEM WITH OTHER SERVICES THAT THEY MIGHT BE ELIGIBLE FOR AND I THINK IT'S DRIVEN FROM THE SAME KINDS OF CONCERNS THAT- A ROOF OVER SOMEONE'S HEAD AND YOU KNOW THAT THAT PROJECT ROOM KEY- AND I PROJECT HOME KEY AS IS MORPHING INTO. IS REALLY SIGNIFICANT AND HELPS SO MUCH TO AVOID THOSE KINDS OF REALLY SIGNIFICANT ELEMENTS SAYS. AND EVEN PROJECT PREMATURE DEATHS THAT WE SEE. BUT IT'S NOT THE ONLY THING WE ALSO NEED TO BRING THESE OTHER SERVICES AND SUPPORTS TO BEAR AND SO ON. I WAS. REALLY HAPPY WHEN I WAS TALKING AND CHECKING IN WITH COUNTIES TO SEE THAT LEVEL OF OUTREACH TO THOSE. INDIVIDUALS TO THAT PROGRAM. THANK YOU CAP YET YOU KNOW I WANNA GO HEAD IN OFFER ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY MY OF THE COMMITTEE TO. PASS ANY AT ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS AND OR COMMENTS I'M SURE THAT AS I WAS SPEAKING THEIR YOU KNOW- AND ASKING QUESTIONS THAT. MAYBE THERE'S SOME POTTERY IDEAS THAT CAME UP SO. ANY SENATOR PAN. THANK YOU AND I REALLY WANT TO% THANK THE PANEL FOR YOUR PRESENTATIONS TODAY I DID HAVE A QUESTION- IS WE CAN WE TALK ABOUT HOW FRESH- EARLIER ON THE% PRESENTATION AND- AND WE HAVE THESE MULTIPLE PROGRAMS- ALTHOUGH I. THINK THAT IN TERMS OF TRYING TO MEET THE TOTAL NEED- WE SORT OF WORK TO DO- BUT PARTICULARLY. IN RELATION TO THE PUBLIC PROGRAMS. TO WHAT DEGREE IS THE PUBLIC CHARGE RULE. AFFECTING PEOPLE NOTS WHO NEED THESE HELP WHICH THE LONG LINES OF PEOPLE NEEDING TO GET FOOD- PERHAPS NOT ABLE TO NOT WILLING TO SIGN UP FOR COVERAGE EFFECTIVE JUST A YEAR AGO PRE COATED DIVERT NEW STORIES ABOUT PEOPLE DROPPING. PROGRAMS LIKE CALFRESH AND THEN OF COURSE THEY MIGHT BE GIANTS FOOD BANKS- TRYING TO GET THROUGH THAT WAY SO. APPS AND ALSO MISS UNDERLING AND- THIS COMPELS WANTS TO SPEAK TO IS THREE L. IS HOW MUCH OF A PROBLEM IS THAT RIGHT NOW PEOPLE NOT WILLING TO SIGN UP FOR PUBLIC PROGRAMS LIKE CALFRESH. I BECAUSE THEY'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THE PUBLIC CHARGE AND THEN MAYBE HOW HOW HOW DOES MEET NEEDS BEING MET TODAY TO START SHIFTS TO FOOD BANKS OR OTHER TYPES OF- SOURCES. ASSEMBLY I'D BE HAPPY TO START THAT AND THEN HANDED OFF TO OTHERS- KATHY AGAIN FROM CEDAR BDA. I DID- NOTE DOWN IN MY NOTES SORT OF PREPARING FOR THIS THAT PUBLIC CHARGE IS LIKELY STILL BEING AN ISSUE OUT THERE. THAT ADMINISTRATION CURRENTLY AND DC HAS- CONTINUED TO ATTEMPT TO STRENGTHEN ENFORCEMENT. TODAY THIS IS. SORT OF AN OFFSHOOT OF PUBLIC CHARGE THERE WERE SOME ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR INDIVIDUALS. I'M THINKING IMMIGRATION SERVICES TO THE U. S. R. I IMMIGRATION SERVICES JUST OUT TODAY. AND I THINK EVERY TIME YOU SEE A HEADLINE. OF ANOTHER STRENGTHENING ANOTHER- TIGHTENING DOWN OF THE SERVICES IT DOES HAVE A CHILLING EFFECT WE'VE- HISTORICALLY SEEN THAT ON THE PUBLIC CHARGES YOU FOR YEARS. THROUGH YOU KNOW SINCE TWENTY FIFTEEN- AS I THINGS WERE PUT OUT EVEN IN DRAFT FORM. THERE WOULD BE- PULLING BACK PEOPLE SAYING STOP MY APPLICATION STOP MY COVERAGE- I'M I'M CONCERNED. AND IT WAS NOT AT THAT POINT YOU KNOW OUR OUR ORIGINAL TALKING POINTS FOR OUR WORKERS. WE STARTED FROM A PLACE OF YOU KNOW DON'T WORRY TOO MUCH BECAUSE YOU ARE LEGITIMATELY ELIGIBLE FOR THESE PROGRAMS. I MEAN WE ARE YOU KNOW I'M- FORTUNATELY OR UNFORTUNATELY I MEAN WE WOULD SAY UNFORTUNATELY TO A LARGE DEGREE. MANY OF THESE PROGRAMS ARE NOT SERVE INDIVIDUALS THAT THEY DON'T HAVE A SATISFACTORY IMMIGRATION STATUS. AND SO WE DON'T HAVE THOSE INDIVIDUALS ON THE PROGRAMS TO BEGIN WITH THEY HAD TO PROVE THAT THEY ARE ELIGIBLE. AND THAT THEIR IMMIGRATION STATUS. COULD END WITH A SATISFACTORY DEFINITION. FOR NEARLY EVERY PROGRAM THAT I NUMBERS RUN. AND SO HAVING PEOPLE WHO HAVE. FOUND ELIGIBILITY THAT PROGRAM WHICH CAN BE HARD ESPECIALLY IF YOU DON'T HAVE ENGLISH AS THEIR- FIRST LANGUAGE I WE AS WE TALKED ABOUT TODAY. ONLY TO HAVE THEM FRIGHTENED- THAT THE PUBLIC CHARGE ROLES- HAVE ALSO BEEN STOPPED I AND STATE BY THE- NEW TIMES OVER THE- YEAR AND A HALF TO TWO. AND THEN WE- AGAIN AND THAT'S GROW I MEAN THAT'S CONFUSING OUR WORKERS LET ALONE. SOMEBODY OUT THERE TRYING TO NAVIGATE THE SYSTEM TO FIGURE OUT IS THAT ON IS OFF AND I COULD SEE PEOPLE JUST GET SO SCARED AND FRUSTRATED. BUT THEY JUST KIND OF THROW THEIR HANDS UP AND TO STOP AND GO INSTEAD TO SOMEPLACE LIKE A FOOD BANK OR CHURCH WHERE THEY MAY HAVE SERVICES AVAILABLE WHERE THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE ASKED THESE QUESTIONS ABOUT. THEIR IMMIGRATION STATUS SO YEAH IT CONTINUES TO BE A SIGNIFICANT CONCERN I GOT MORE HOPEFUL THE OUTLOOK FOR THIS COULD BE IMPROVED IN THE FUTURE BUT AS OF NOW THESE RULES ARE THERE AND- EVEN JUST TODAY LIKE I SAID THINGS CONTINUE. TO HAPPEN WITH IMMIGRATION AND IMMIGRANTS IN THE NEWS AND EVERY TIME WHAT WAS THAT THAT HAS A CHILLING EFFECT- AS HARD TO GATHER DATA ON PEOPLE WHO DON'T. APPLY AS YOU KNOW- BUT CERTAINLY WE SEE- AND HAVE SEEN OVER TIME SO MANY PEOPLE TO. TAKE THEMSELVES OFF THE PROGRAMMER TAKE YOU KNOW THEIR FAMILIES OFF THE PROGRAM EVEN AT THEIR THEIR ELIGIBLE FOR THESE SERVICES AND SUPPORT THEM- THAT'S REALLY HARD TO SEE. THE YOU COME AND THEN AT THE INTERESTED HEARING FROM FOOD BANKS AS WELL AS WHAT THEY'RE SAYING- THESE ARE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY QUALIFY. MAYBE PERHAPS ARE U. S. CITIZENS WHO ARE PART OF NEXT FAMILIES WHO ARE BASICALLY. NOT AVAILING THEMSELVES OF DESPERATELY NEEDED. FOOD BECAUSEOF. THIS- REGULATION. YEAH THAT'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. TWENTY CLEAR ABOUT THAT THANK YOU. AND THEN PERHAPS I DON'T KNOW IF TAT IS COMPELS FROM FOOD TO US CENTRAL CALIFORNIA FOOD BANK ARE YOU SEEING- PEOPLE WHO PERHAPS WOULD QUALIFY FOR- SERVICES LIKE CALFRESH POTENTIALLY UP TO DRINK BECAUSE- EIGHT. OUR FREIGHT TO APPLY. DEFINITELY I THINK WHAT WE'RE SEEING ANECDOTALLY APARTMENT AND I'M HAPPY JEFF AND KATHY JUST COMMUNICATED- AND YOU KNOW WE HAVE- A LARGE- PERCENT OF THE POPULATION THAT WE'RE SERVING IN CENTRAL CALIFORNIA ARE LACKING ACT COMMUNITY AND- THEY. ARE AND- BUILD ARE YOU BY PUBLIC CHAU AND THEIR ARE TYPICALLY- I'M THEM SO FORMER WHERE THE KIDS ARE ELIGIBLE FOR. BUT BECAUSE THERE'S- ONE INTERSEGMENT GATED BUT FEDERAL STANDARDS HERE REGARDING- YOU KNOW THAT THAT- PUBLIC CHARGE WILL THAT DAY ARE YOU. ENROLLING IN THE S. AND WHICH THEIR CHILDREN- OR- AND HELP NUMBER ARE L. BE BUT. YOU KNOW HERE OF DEPORTATION OR- OR RETALIATION. YEAH THE APPLE MANY EMERGENCY COULD THAT WORK AND BAD WHICH KNOW QUICK BUT HIGHER NOT. THANK YOU PARTNERS BE ABLE TO COLLECT GROWING YOU COUPLE THAT WITH THE CAN DOWN ARE YOU GOING AT THE INDIVIDUAL THAT. HAVE NEVER NEEDED SERVICE BUT BEFORE I KNEW COULD NOT YOU KNOW THANK YOU COULD NOT AND- ANYTHING AND WE'RE GOING NOT MEETING FOR. FIBER ONE I'M THE EMERGING YOUNG NUMBER PROVIDE YOU CAN PROVIDE NINE SO WE NEED THE PROBE TO WORK I YOU KNOW. FOR YOU KNOW FOR THOSE THAT ARE RIGHT EMERGING NOT WORKING NOT UP- YOU KNOW THAT THE DIFFERENT TACK YEAH ACTUALLY PROVIDE THEM. ON THE HEALTH CARE AND PERHAPS WE CAN ASK THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT- IN THE CURRENT MINISTRATION TO SUSPEND THE RULES SO THAT WE CAN HELP AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE THANK YOU. THANK YOU UP THANK YOU TO THE PANEL FOR PARTICIPATING TODAY AT THE INFORMATION PROVIDED IS. VERY INFORMATIVE SO WE'LL BE MOVING ON TO OUR FINAL PANEL AND WE WILL DISCUSS CHANGES IN SCHOOL MEAL PROGRAM STRYCOVA NINETEEN. AND WE HAVE- STEPHANIE BRUCE. WITH PETER TURCHIN CERTAIN NUTRITION SERVICES DIRECTOR PALM SPRINGS UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT- AS OUR FOR SPEAKERS SO- STEPHANIE PLEASE FEEL FREE TO BEGIN WHEN YOU ARE READY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. AND THANK YOU TO THE COMMITTEE FOR HAVING THIS WONDERFUL HEARING AND INVITING ALL OF US TO SPEAK INCLUDING MYSELF AND I'D BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T THANK ALL OF THE PREVIOUS PANELISTS FOR. SO ELOQUENTLY DESCRIBING THE COMPLEXITIESOF THESE PROGRAMS AND THE STRUGGLE THAT MANY OF THOSE WHO- SHOULD BE PARTICIPATING IN THEM FACE. IN IN JUST PARTICIPATING IN THESE PROGRAMS THAT WE OFFER AND BUT I AM THE DIRECTOR OF NUTRITION SERVICES FOR PALM SPRINGS UNIFIED AND WE ARE A PREDOMINANTLY HISPANIC DISTRICT WE COVER FIVE CITIES PALM SPRINGS DESERT HOT SPRINGS. CATHEDRAL CITY THOUSAND PALMS IN A PORTION OF RANCHO MIRAGE. AND WE PRIOR TO COPE ED WERE NOW LOOKING TO PROBABLY REACH ABOUT 96% FREE AND REDUCED POST CODE ED- AND AS MANY OF YOU MAY KNOW THAT WE ARE A RESORT TOWN. AND SO ON MARCH THIRTEENTH MANY OF OUR FAMILIES LOST THEIR JOB I'M AND IN MOST OF OUR FAMILIES I AM STILL REMAIN UNEMPLOYED AT BECAUSE OF THE INABILITY TO OPEN UP MANY OF OUR RESTAURANTS HOTELS- AND OTHER HOSPITALITY. FUNCTIONS FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO GET BACK TO WORK THROUGH OUR MEAL PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT FOR THEM. M. 63% OF OUR ENROLLMENT IS AUTOMATICALLY QUALIFIED FOR THE MEAL PROGRAM BASED ON THE PROGRAMS THAT YOU JUST HEARD ABOUT CALFRESH SNAP ON MEDICARE. AND SO AS A RESULT OF THAT WE ARE A 1100% C. E. P. DISTRICT SO ALL MEALS ARE SERVED AT NO COST TO YOU ARE I'M STUDENT POPULATION. AND SO WHEN THE SHUTDOWN HAPPENED WE KNEW THAT WAS GOING T BE A HUGE NEED FOR OUR COMMUNITIES AND I'M JUST TO PUT THINGS IN PERSPECTIVE ON A NORMAL SCHOOL YEAR WHERE WE'RE SERVING BREAKFAST LUNCH AND SUPPER. AND WE SERVE APPROXIMATELY THREE POINT FIVE MILLION MEALS AND SINCE THE PANDEMIC HIT WE HAVE ALREADY SERVED THREE POINT EIGHT MILLION MEALS M. AND WILL FAR SURPASS THAT AND BY THE TIME WE GET TO THE END OF OUR SCHOOL YEAR. AT SO THEY NEED ALTHOUGH HAS DECLINED A LITTLE AND IT IS STILL GREATLY NEEDED AND FOR ALL OF OUR PARENTS AND OUR STUDENTS AS WELL. BUT I WANT TO TALK TO YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT A SILVER LINING IN THIS WHOLE PANDEMIC AND- PRIOR TO COPE ED OUR GOAL HERE IN PALM SPRINGS WAS TO REDUCE PACKAGING AND- TO SERVE OUR STUDENTS. A REAL MEAL AS WE CALL IT SO THAT THEY DON'T HAVE. TO SIT DOWN AND SPEND TEN MINUTES ON PACKAGING I. TO EAT ANTS THAT WE CONSIDER THEM MOVE ON A- ON A PLATE HAND IT TO THEM AND THEY CAN SIT DOWN AND SPEND THE TWENTY TO THIRTY MINUTES EATING INSTEAD OF OPENING PACKAGES. I'M WE HAD JUST INSTALLED OUR LAST SALAD BAR IN OUR LAST SCHOOL SITE- SO THAT STUDENTS WERE BEING OFFERED. A VARIETY OF FRESH FRUITS AND VEGETABLES THERE WERE SIX VARIETIES OF VEGETABLES IN TWO VARIETIES OF FRUIT EVERY DAY OFFERED TO THEM ON AN OPEN PRODUCE FAR. MOST OF WHICH WAS PROVIDED BY LOCAL FARMERS FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WHEN THE PANDEMIC HIT BE HAD TO SCRAP ALL OF THAT IDEA INCLUDING OUR BEAUTIFUL PRODUCE BARS. AND WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE WERE GOING TO PROVIDE. YOU GREAT QUALITY MEAL THAT WE WERE PROVIDING I THIS PANDEMIC AND- AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT A LOCAL DATE FARMER WHO. AND HIS COMPLETE SUPPLY CHAIN WAS CUT OFF IN MARCH. ASKED ME IF I HAD ANY USE FOR DATES AND YOU KNOW I SAID WELL I'M I CAN'T AFFORD THEM ON THIS MEAL PROGRAM. AND I THINK I HEARD. EARLIER THAT THE- THE- AND THE FOR THE- WAS SIXTY DOLLARS FOR THREE MEALS I'M IN OUR REIMBURSEMENT OF LESS THAN FOUR DOLLARS PER MEAL-SO. AND WITH THAT IT'S HARD TO AFFORD- SOMETHING LIKE A DATE THAT IS USUALLY A HIGH RETAIL ITEM. WELL HE WAS ABLE TO GET IT DOWN TO THE COSTS THAT WE NEEDED WAS ABLE TO. PACKAGE IT FOR US SO THAT WE CAN DISTRIBUTE IT. AND MY STUDENTS WERE ABLE TO GET DATES FOR THE FIRST TIME ON THE MEAL PROGRAM AND- THE TWO OF US TO STARTED TALKING AND I HAD TOLD HIM HOW FOR YEARS I HAD BEEN TRYING TO- MEET AND TALK TO THE LOCAL GROWERS HEARING COACHELLA. AND SEE IF I COULD GET THEIR PRODUCE ON OUR STUDENTS PLATES AND- NO ONE REALLY COULD UNDERSTAND THE NEED THEN AND I'M MAINLY BECAUSE THEY JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND. THE PROGRAM AT THE VOLUME OF THE PROGRAM. WELL HE BECAME. THE MIDDLE MAN AND WE STARTED BUILDING RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE LOCAL FARMERS WHOSE CONTRACTS WERE GONE OVERNIGHT. AND THOSE WERE WHO ARE SMALL FARMERS WHO DIDN'T HAVE MAJOR CORPORATION- CONTRACTS WERE GONNA GET PAID WHETHER THEIR FRUIT WAS PICKED OR NOT. AND OFFERED UP THEIR CROPS AND WE FIGURED OUT HOW MUCH I COULD PURCHASE WHICH TURNED OUT TO BE ALL OF IT. AND SO WHAT WE DID IS WE JUST STARTED GOING OUT TO THE FRUIT PRODUCERS AND SAYING WHAT YOU HAVE WHAT CAN I TAKE. AND WE PUT TOGETHER A PRODUCE BOX AND WHAT WE WERE ABLE TO DO WITH ACCOUNT FOR THOSE FOR THE- THE FRUIT AND VEGETABLE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MEAL PROGRAM. ABLE TO MEET THE NUTRITIONAL GUIDELINES ABLE TO MEET OUR FOOD COSTS AND ABLE TO PUT A WHOLE FRESH PRODUCE IN THE HANDS OF OUR KIDS. MUCH OF WHICH THEY'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE AND WE WERE DOING DIFFERENT KINDS OF BIG PLANS I HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE I'M A GRAFFITI EGGPLANT WHICH IS A SMALL LITTLE PURPLE EGGPLANT. WITH WHITE VARIEGATED LINES THROUGH IT DELICIOUS- AND I FOUND IT A WHOLE FOODS MARKET. FOR SEVEN DOLLARS PER EGG PLANT AND I WAS GIVING IT AS PART OF THE MULE PRO. I'M SO IT. IT WAS A GREAT RELATIONSHIP THAT WE ESTABLISHED AND WE CONTINUE TODAY. I WISH I COULD TELL YOU HOW MANY WE'VE DONE WE DO APPROXIMATELY THREE TO FOUR THOUSAND BOXES A WEEK. OUT TO OUR COMMUNITY AND HAVE DONE THAT- SINCE ALMOST THE BEGINNING OF THIS PANDEMIC AND- WE'RE HOPING TO MOVE THAT RELATIONSHIP M. INTO. THE NEXT PHASE OF THIS. PANDEMIC WHICH HOPEFULLY ONCE WE GET OUR STUDENTS BACK TO SCHOOL WERE ABLE TO TAKE IT TO SOME PALLETS AND NOT IN THESE VARIETY OF BOXES. AND ABLE TO SERVE THE STUDENTS A OF FRESH. PRODUCE BAR SO TO SPEAK THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO BE SERVING TO THEM AND- SAID OF THEM WALKING DOWN AN OPEN BAR AND SERVING THEMSELVES- BUT- YOU KNOW WITH ALL OF THAT THE COMPLEXITIES OF OUR PROGRAMS AND- THE- THE- AND HURDLES THAT WE FACE IN ORDER TO GET WHAT WE NEED. TO OUR COMMUNITY AND TO OUR STUDENTS AND FAMILIES AND- JUST PARTNERING THE PEOPLE RIGHT NEXT DOOR WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO CONTINUE ON THE PATH THAT WE'RE TRYING TO MAINTAIN AND- PROVIDE A WELL BALANCED NUTRITIOUS FRESH. LOCAL PRODUCTS TO OUR STUDENTS ON THIS BILL PROGRAM. SO JUST WANT TO THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO SHARE THAT AND- THANK YOU ALL FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK. THANK YOU STEPHANIE UP TAX WE HAVE A LISA KENNY OF THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION. LISA UP. PLEASE FEEL FREE TO BEGIN WHEN YOU ARE READY. ALL.

I STILL HAVE YOU GUYS YES WE CAN. SAKE IT IS ALL. OKAY SO- WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO TALK TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT IS OUR FOOD SERVICE PROGRAM THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING SINCE THE PANDEMIC HITS. WE STARTED OUT ACTUALLY- WORKING OUT OF A BAND SERVING LUNCHES TO KIDS AND- WE'RE STILL DOING THAT BUT WE HAVE A SET UP FOR COMMUNITY AND- WE HAVE NOW JUST GOT ALL OF OUR KIDS BACK HERE TO BE OF ASSISTANCE THEY WERE DOING TWO SEPARATE WE'RE DOING IN AM PM PROGRAM. IT'S SO FAR SEEMS TO BE WORKING VERY WELL- SH ELSE'S WHEN I JUST HIT THE- TWENTY THREE YOU. I UNDERSTAND. I UNDERSTAND THAT- GILROY IS TO- ADAPTER PROGRAM THAT OFFERS US. SERVING LATER IN THE DAY TO HELP THE PEOPLE THAT COME CAN COME AS EARLY AS A NEED TO COME. AND SO THAT'S A GREAT THING THAT THEY'RE DOING AND WE'RE TRYING TO ALSO DO THAT WE'VE GOT- I'M KIND OF BABBLING SEPT AT LEAST STRUCTURE IF YOU'RE HEARING ME- WE SERVE THE COMMUNITY FROM TEN O'CLOCK TO ONE O'CLOCK EVERY DAY. AND WE HAVE OUR- OTHER- COAT COLOR CLASSES THAT WE SERVE. AND- I THOUGHT PROCESS I'M SO SORRY I'VE BEEN WAITING WAITING TO TALK YOU KNOW OUR COMPLETELY LOST FROM GOING. THIS SO ANYWAY DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THE FOOD SERVICE PROGRAM. YOU KNOW WHAT I AM IF YOU'RE DONE WITH YOUR PRESENTATION I WILL BRING BE A CONVERSATION BACK TO THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND WE CAN OPEN IT UP FOR QUESTIONS I'M SORRY SIX HARD TO HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING OKAY. IF WE'RE DONE WITH YOUR PRESENTATION WE WILL BRING THE CONVERSATION BACK TO COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR QUESTIONS. IT BUT YOU DON'T SEE WHAT ELSE I WAS GONNA. SO SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT I WAS ASKED WAS ABOUT THE- FEEDING THE ARE THE KIDS LIKE WHEN AFTER WHEN THEY GO HOME AND WE DO ACTUALLY HAVE IS HAVE THAT SET UP IT'S CALLED AND SERVE SELL. SHELF STABLE LUNCHES SO WHAT WE'RE DOING IS WE'RE SERVING- LUNCHES TO THE KIDS AT SCHOOL AND THEN WE'RE ALSO GIVING THEM A BREAKFAST TO TAKE HOME WITH THEM. SO THEY CAN EAT BREAKFAST THE NEXT MORNING BEFORE THEY COME TO SCHOOL. AND THEN WE ALSO DO ON FRIDAYS WE DO WHAT WE CALL WHAT I CALL ON FRIDAY THREE IT'S WHERE WE- WERE ABLE TO FEED OUR COMMUNITY AND ALSO SEND THEM HOME WITH ENOUGH BREAKFAST AND LUNCH IS TO GET THEM THROUGH THE WEEKEND AND A BREAKFAST FOR MONDAY FOR WHEN THEY COME BACK TO SCHOOL. ALSO WE HAVE THEN WE WERE DOING THE- YOU SEE. BUDGET JUST SORRY. SO YEAH YOU KNOW THE FOOD SERVICE WORKERS HAVE BEEN WORKING THIS WHOLE TIME TO THE PANDEMIC. AND THEY JUST THERE ARE OTHER AMAZING PEOPLE THE THINGS THAT THEY DO AND THE WAY THEY DO IT. IS I CAN'T TELL YOU IN WORDS- FEEDING THE KIDS IS JUST SUCH AN IMPORTANT THING TO DO AND MAKING SURE THAT THEY'VE GOT THE FOOD THEY NEED TO HELP THEM LEARN AND- GROW AND- WE WITH WITH THANK YOU LISA AND FOR ALL OF YOUR WORK AND- IN AT THIS MOMENT WE WILL GO AHEAD AND BRING THE CONVERSATION BACK TO- COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR ANY QUESTIONS OF FOR THIS PANEL- AND WE WILL GO AHEAD AND START OFF WITH. A CENTER PAN. RIGHT RIGHT WELL THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATIONS AND- CERTAINLY TRYING TO GET OUR KIDS THAT IS GOING TO BE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT I GUESS MY FIRST QUESTION IS THAT- COMPARED TO LAST YEAR BEFORE CO THERE'D. WHAT PERCENTAGE OF KIDS ARE OR HOW MANY KIDS ARE YOU FEEDING SO DO YOU SEE A DROP OFF AND HOW MUCH IS THAT NOW THAT WE'RE WITH CODED AND DISTANCE LEARNING SO FOTH BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT FOR EXAMPLE DURING THE SCHOOL YEAR AND THEN DURING THE SUMMER WHEN THE KIDS ARE OUT OF SCHOOL AND WE HAVE SOME REAL PROGRAMS OUT THAT'S THE A LARGE DROP BOXES KIDS WHO QUALIFIED FOR. REDUCED LUNCH- DURING THE SUMMER SO I WAS WONDERING AS FAR AS- I KNOW THAT LAW SCHOOLS ARE DOING WORKING VERY HARD TO DISTRIBUTE MEALS OUT TO FAMILIES AND THEIR KIDS. HOW MUCH OF A DROP OFF HAVE WE SEEN FROM LET'S SAY LAST YEAR. CREEK OVERHEAD. TO NOW IN TERMS OF SIZE OF FAMILIES OR STUDENTS BEING SERVED. YEAH I HAVE THAT FOR YOU ACTUALLY IN FEBRUARY OF- NINETEEN TWENTY WE DID FORTY THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED LEVEL INCHES. ELEVEN MEALS AND THEN SIXTEEN THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED FORTY BREAKFAST. AND IN APRIL OF NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY WE DID SEVEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND TWENTY SEVEN LUNCHES AND SEVEN THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED NINETY SEVEN BREAKFAST SO THERE WAS QUITE A DROP. IN THERE THE NUMBERS AT THE END AND IT'S HARD TO GET THE STATUS DE DO YOU- THIRTEEN TERMS OF. WHAT THE IMPACT OF THAT IN SO THE EXPECTATION IS YOU HAVE A LOT MORE KIDS TO- NEEDED THESE MEALS AND NOW WE KNOW A LOT FEWER GETTING THEM DO YOU KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING TO THOSE KIDS IN THOSE WAYS DO YOU DO YOU HAVE ANY DATA ON THAT PART. I WOULD DON'T IT WAS LIKE- BECAUSE NOW ARE WE ARE MALES ARE STARTING TO COME UP AGAIN NOW. BUT YESTERDAY THE CHINA IS THE BEST WAY TO CONVERT IT. PLEASE I MIGHT BE ABLE TO SPEAK TO THAT THANK YOU. I'M LIKE I'M SO SORRY I'M SO BEFUDDLED I WAS SO WORRIED I WOULDN'TBE ABLE TO TALK TO YOUR BILL TO HEAR ME AND NOW THAT I. CAN'T SEEM TO. ITS OPPONENT. SENATOR PAN SO HERE IN CALIFORNIA- LIKE AT LEAST IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND MANY OTHER DISTRICTS SAW A HUGE DROP IN PARTICIPATION. AND IT REALLY HAD TO DO WITH- THEIR FREE AND REDUCED PERCENTAGE SO. THOSE WHO WERE LOWER FRAME REDUCE ALL LARGE DROP IN PARTICIPATION IN MAINLY BECAUSE- OF THE ACCESS. AND STUDENTS WERE ON CAMPUS AND APPEARANCE SOME PARENTS WERE STILL WORKING. AND WEREN'T ABLE TO GET THE PARENTS TO SCHOOLS TO GET THEM THEIR FOOD SO. MANY DISTRICTS CHANGE THEIR OPERATIONS TO ALLOW FOR EARLY MORNING OR LATE EVENING OR LATE AFTERNOON. AND EARLY EVENING. TO ALLOW THE PARENTS TO COME AND PARTICIPATE SO THEY STARTED TO SEE- PARTICIPATION GROW. I KNOW HERE IN OUR DISTRICT WE WERE A LITTLE BIT OF AN ANOMALY. WE ACTUALLY SERVED OUR TOTAL MEALS THAT WE SERVE ALL LAST SUMMER. THE FIRST WEEK. IN MAY LAST SUMMER WE DID SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND MEALS IN TWO MONTHS WE DID SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND MEALS IN ONE WEEK. M. AND WE ACTUALLY DID CLOSE TO EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND MEALS OVER THE SUMMER. AND SO I AM AND THAT HAD EVERYTHING TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT WE HAD SEVERAL SITES OPEN WE HAD BUSES DELIVERING TO BUS STOPS. AND SO WE WERE TRYING TO GET TO THE FAMILIES WHO DIDN'T HAVE TRANSPORTATION. AND SO NOW THAT SCHOOL IS BACK IN SESSION AND WHAT WE DON'T HAVE OUR BUSES RIGHT NOW BECAUSE IT'S A CONTRACTED COMPANY THEY'RE NOT EMPLOYEES OF THE DISTRICT. AND WE ARE LOSING OUT ON AND THOSE STUDENTS ARE LOSING. ACCESS TO THE MEAL PROGRAM BECAUSE WE JUST DON'T. HAVE THAT ACCESS RIGHT NOW SO WE'RE LOOKING ACTUALLY INTO STARTING AN ONLINE MEAL SERVICE. SO THEY CAN ORDER AND WILL DELIVER AND JUST WILL HAVE. CERTAIN AREAS OF. OUR DISTRICT. YOUR DELIVERY DATE WILL BE THURSDAY SO BE HOME BETWEEN THESE HOURS. PLACE YOUR ORDER WILL BRING IT TO YOU. AND ANYTHING WE. CAN DO TO JUST IMPROVE ACCESS. NO NOT SOME YEAH. NO THANK YOU AND THAT THESE LESSONS THAT WERE. THAT NOT ONLY OF COURSE WILL HELP DURING CO THAT HOPEFULLY WHEN WE'RE ABLE TO GET CONTROL OF IT AND- SO FORTH THE NAVY WITH ACCION AND WE GET. PEOPLE TO YOU KNOW SHELTER AND WATER MASKS AND SO FORTH. I THINK THESE ARE YEAH WE WERE DEALING WITH THIS PROBLEM CREE COVE IT GOT WORSE WITH CODE BUT- NOT EVEN AS WE'RE GETTING HOPEFULLY EVENTUALLY GONNA GET COVERED UNDER CONTROL THESE ARE THINGS WE SHOULD PRICE THINK ABOUT. FIGURE OUT HOW TO CONTINUE AFTERWARDS TO- THAN IMPROVING. THE OUTRAGE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER PAN AYE SO I HAVE A ONE QUESTION OF FOR A STEPHANIE I'D LIKE TO- KNOW IF YOU- YOU KNOW. AND I KNOW YOU TOUCHED ON THIS A LITTLE BIT BUT BUT DO YOU KNOW THE DIFFERENT TACK CORPS NADINE WITH OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY BUT I WANTED TO KNOW IF THERE'S ANY KIND OF WORK BEING DONE IN. OUR PARTNERSHIPSWITH ANY CHILD CARE CENTERS. WE ACTUALLY DELIVERED A CHILD CARE CENTERS AND OBEY OUR LOCAL ARE RIVERSIDE COUNTY OFFICE- PROVIDED IS A LIST THAT THEY WERE AWARE OF. WE KNOW OF SEVERAL IN OUR OWN AREA AND MANY OF THEM ARE SHOWING UP TOWARD DISTRIBUTION SITES SO WE JUST GOT THEIR INFORMATION OF THE DISTRIBUTION SITE SO THAT THEY WOULDN'T HAVE TO COME OUT. TO PICK UP WE JUST DELIVER STRAIGHT TO THEM. AND CAN YOU EXPLAIN A LITTLE BIT MORE OF HOW THAT WORKS BECAUSE TO BE HONEST WITH YOU I'M A LITTLE I'M FAMILIAR WITH IT SURE IT WILL BECAUSE WE'RE ON THE SUMMER FOOD SERVICE PROGRAM WERE ABLE TO SERVE ANY STUDENT- EIGHTEEN UNDER ANY CHILD EIGHTEEN AND UNDER. SO AS AS WE DISCOVER OR FIND OUT ABOUT CHILD CARE FACILITIES THAT WE'RE UNAWARE OF OR EVEN THOSE THAT WE ARE AWARE OF. THE JUST PROVIDE US A ROSTER OF THE STUDENTS THAT ARE ATTENDING AND THEN WE PROVIDE THEM THE MEALS I HAVE FOR THEM TO PROVIDE TO THE STUDENTS. AND MANY OF THEM COOK ON SITE SO WE PROVIDE THEM AND- IT I MEAN IT WE LIKEN IT TO LIKE A HELLO FRESH OR BLUE APRON BOX THAT YOU CAN ORDER ONLINE. WE PROVIDE THEM THE BOX OF INGREDIENTS AND LAUGH MEALS FOR BREAKFAST LUNCH SUPPER AND AN AFTERNOON SNACK FOR THOSE STUDENTS BECAUSE MANY OF THOSE CHILDREN ARE WITH THEM FROM. SEVEN O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING UNTIL SEVEN O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING. DEPENDING ON WHERE THEIR PARENTS ARE WORKING- SO BECAUSE MANY OF THEM ARE COMMUTING AND WORKING AND FLAUNT FAR DISTANCES FROM US SO.

THANK YOU AT ANOTHER QUESTION JUST KIND OF PULL UP ON THAT OUR TOPIC FAIR SO IS THIS JUST A SPECIFIC BIT TO PUT THE PALM SPRINGS UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT ARE YOU AWARE OF ANY OTHER SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT ARE DOING SOMETHING SIMILAR WHERE THEY'RE PROVIDING FOOD TO DATE. AT DAY CARE CENTERS. MANY DISTRICTS ARE DOING THIS I'M I'M ON ZIEHM CHATS WITH DIRECTORS FROM ALL OVER THE STATE. AND MANY OF HIS HEARING RIVERSIDE COUNTY OR DOING THAT I KNOW OF SEVERAL DISTRICTS IN THE SACRAMENTO AREA WHO ARE DOING THAT- AS WELL AS THE FRESNO AREA WHICH IS WHERE MY FAMILY'S FROM. SO I I'M VERY FAMILIAR WITH ALL OF THEIR EFFORTS AND ANY OF THEM WHO HAVE STEPPED UP AND ASKED FOR THE MEALS. THEY PROVIDED THEM- MANY OF THEM OF HAVE FOUND THEM THE WAY WE HAVE AS WELL THEY SHOW UP TO THEIR DISTRIBUTION SITES ONE IN TWENTY FIVE MEALS. SO THAT USUALLY PEAKS OUR INTERESTING WE FIND BETTER WAYS TO PROVIDE FOR THEM SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO LEAVE THEIR FACILITY TO COME GET THE MEALS. DO YOU THINK THAT THERE IS A WAY FOR US TO IMPROVE AB. TWO BIT TO PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION OF WHAT YOU'RE DOING YOU KNOW ACROSS THE STATE. YEAH I THINK IT'S COUNTY BECAUSE COUNTY OFFICES NO OF THESE PROGRAMS AND IF THEY COULD PROVIDE THE DISTRICTS WITH THE LIST OF THOSE PROGRAMS THAT'S WHAT ARE COUNTY OFFICE HERE IN RIVERSIDE DID. AND WHEN I TALK TO OTHER- DIRECTORS WHO ARE NOT WITHIN MY COUNTY AND THEY FIND OUT I JUST YOU KNOW GIVE YOUR COUNTY OFFICE A CALL HERE'S THE OFFICE THAT PROVIDED IT TO US.

THE VIRUS. IS THAT AN ISSUE ARE PEOPLE ABLE TO GET ACCESS TO THE PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT THEY NEED. WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO HELP GET ACCESS AND I CAN TELL YOU AND I'M SURE LISA CAN TO THAT- CHILD NUTRITION PROGRAMS ARE PROBABLY THE MOST CONCERNED WITH SAFETY AND ALWAYS HAVE BEEN. WE'VE WORN MASKS IN OUR DEPARTMENT FOR YEARS AND BECAUSE WE HAVE A CENTRAL FACILITY. AND SO WE HAVE GLOVES MASKS AND WE PROVIDE. THEM AT HAND WIPES AND ALL OF OUR MEALS WE'VE GOT HAND WASHING STATIONS- SANITIZING STATIONS WE HAVE A PROTOCOL ON HAND WASHING- AND IF THEY'RE OUT DELIVERING THEIR PROVIDED HAND WIPES AS WELL SO THAT THEY CAN.

SENATOR HER TODD ALLEN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU ALSO FOR HAVING THIS HEARING TODAY ABOUT THIS VERY IMPORTANT SUBJECT MY NAME IS KEVIN MCALLISTER AND I AM THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR WITH MEALS ON WHEELS SACRAMENTO. WE HAVE BEEN PROVIDING TWELVE THOUSAND MEALS A WEEK PASSED FOR OVER TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED SENIORS I WAS ALSO RECENTLY NAMED PRESIDENT HAVE MEALS ON WHEELS CALIFORNIA STATEWIDE POLICY ALLIANCE OF MORE THAN FIFTY ORGANIZATIONS WHO SPEAK WITH A UNIFIED VOICE FOR NUTRITION PROVIDERS TO BRIGHTEN THE IMPACT OF OUR PROGRAMS ACROSS THE STATE. AND IMPROVE THE LIVES OF SENIORS ADULTS WITH DISABILITIES AND THEIR FAMILIES THERE ARE TWO KEY FACTS WE HOPE YOU TAKE AWAY FROM TODAY'S HEARING PERSONAL LEVEL OF FOOD ASSISTANCE NEEDED IN OUR COMMUNITIES HAS PROFOUNDLY INCREASED SINCE THE PANDEMIC STARTED. AND SECOND THE PANDEMIC HAS REQUIRED US TO CHANGE A LOT OF OUR PRACTICES AND HOW WE PROVIDE MEALS BUT THESE FACTORS HAVE INCREASED OUR COST SIGNIFICANTLY FROM MARCH OF THIS YEAR WHEN THE PANDEMIC SEVEN TO FEBRUARY OF THIS COMING YEAR BUILDING WILL ESTIMATES WE WILL SERVE MORE THAN SEVENTEEN MILLION MEALS ACROSS CALIFORNIA. THIS IS A NEARLY 75% INCREASE FROM THE PRIOR YEAR THIRTEEN OUT OUR MEALS ON WHEELS PROGRAMS IN THE STATE HAVE INCREASED THEIR NUMBER OF MEALS SERVED. BY MORE THAN 1100% IN THIS SAME PERIOD AREA SURVEY INDICATES OUR CLIENT BASE HAS INCREASED NEARLY 70% MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND CLIENTS. IN ADDITION TO INCREASING DEMAND FOR OUR SERVICES COVERED HAS REQUIRED US TO MAKE A NUMBER OF THINGS NEVER AGAIN CHANGES AND HOW WE PROVIDE MEALS WE CAN'T DO CONGREGATE MEALS AT THIS TIME. SO WE HAVE HAD TO ADD HOME DELIVERED IN DRIVE THROUGH PICK UP MEALS WHICH REQUIRE MORE STAFF AND WHILE WE NEED MORE STAFF THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE. WE HAVE FEWER VOLUNTEERS DUE TO CONCERNS ABOUT THE PANDEMIC WE NEED PP. WE HAD TO PIVOT TO MANAGING A REMOTE WORKFORCE AND NAVIGATING SOCIAL DISTANCING FOR INTAKE OF NEW CLIENTS. ASSESSMENT AND HOME DELIVERY. IT IS CHALLENGING RETRAINING STAFF THAT I'VE CONSTANTLY HAD TO PIVOT DURING COLD IT ESPECIALLY WITHOUT RECEIVING HAZARD PAY. WHICH ISN'T TO WORKERS SHOULD RECEIVE. AND THERE IS NO END IN SIGHT OUR CLIENTS WILL BE THE LAST TO COME OUT A STAY AT HOME ORDERS AT LEAST UNTIL A VACCINE BECOMES AVAILABLE AND IS WIDELY DISTRIBUTED. IN MOST OF OUR MEMBERS ANTICIPATE THAT MOST OF THE GREAT PLACE PROGRAMS WILL CONTINUE TO NEED SERVICES ONCE I PROGRAM EXPIRES. THE STATE MUST PLAN FOR THIS LIKELY SCENARIO. FOR THE VULNERABLE COMMUNITY MEMBERS WE SERVE THE MILITANTS ALSO CONNECTION WE PROVIDE THEM ARE ALL THAT IT KEEPING THEM FROM HUNGER AND ISOLATION. LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND THE ADMINISTRATION TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS ADEQUATE FUNDING TO SUPPORT FOOD ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS PARTICULARLY FOR SENIORS ADULTS WITH DISABILITIES AND THEIR FAMILIES.
