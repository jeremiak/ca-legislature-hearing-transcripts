02:04:37.236 --> 02:04:39.605
SUPPLY THE MATERIAL. SOME

02:04:39.672 --> 02:04:41.040
PRODUCT CATEGORIES ARE

02:04:41.106 --> 02:04:42.541
INCORRECTLY DESCRIBED IN THE

02:04:46.212 --> 02:04:47.746
COMES TO MIND OF COMPOST

02:04:47.813 --> 02:04:50.015
COMPOST IS BY DEFINITION A

02:04:50.082 --> 02:04:52.251
RECYCLED CONTENT PRODUCT SO

02:04:52.318 --> 02:04:54.253
INCLUDING A MINIMUM RECYCLED

02:04:54.320 --> 02:04:56.922

02:04:56.989 --> 02:04:59.525
NEVER REALLY MADE SENSE IT IS

02:04:59.592 --> 02:05:02.228
1100% RECYCLED CONTENT. HOWEVER

02:05:02.294 --> 02:05:04.163
INCREASING THE USE OF RECYCLED

02:05:04.230 --> 02:05:06.732
COMPOST AND MULCH HAS BEEN A

02:05:06.799 --> 02:05:07.700
PRIORITY FOR A VARIETY OF

OF COMPOST USED IS THE

02:05:30.222 --> 02:05:33.292
APPROPRIATE METRIC. AND FINALLY

02:05:33.359 --> 02:05:34.126
THERE'S BEE A LACK OF

02:05:34.193 --> 02:05:36.195

02:05:38.364 --> 02:05:39.965
IN PLACE TO HAVE A STRONG

02:05:40.032 --> 02:05:43.602

DOOR SOARED AWAY WITH THE ANNEX

02:27:35.112 --> 02:27:37.248
PROJECT THE PIECE OF THEIR NEXT

02:27:37.315 --> 02:27:38.616
PROJECT I'VE BEEN WORKING ON

02:27:38.683 --> 02:27:40.351
MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE IS MORE

02:27:40.418 --> 02:27:41.419
THAN FOUR YEARS OLD AT THIS

02:27:41.485 --> 02:27:43.588
POINT AND IT'S A SECURITY

02:27:43.654 --> 02:27:45.223
CONVERSATION. I STARTED THE

02:27:45.289 --> 02:27:46.924
SECURITY CONVERSATION VERY VERY

02:27:46.991 --> 02:27:48.392
EARLY BECAUSE I KNEW THAT IF WE

02:27:48.459 --> 02:27:50.127
WAITED THE LAST MINUTE TO DO

02:27:50.194 --> 02:27:52.029
WHAT'S ISSUES OF SECURITY. IT

02:27:52.096 --> 02:27:53.898
WOULD BE SO MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE.

02:27:53.965 --> 02:27:55.066
BECAUSE IN HAVE A LOT OF CHANGE

02:27:55.132 --> 02:27:56.434
ORDERS AND THEY WERE JUST SAID

02:27:56.500 --> 02:27:59.136
THE COST OF THE ROOF. THIS BILL

02:27:59.203 --> 02:28:02.039
BENEFITS THAT SAME PATTERN THIS

02:28:02.106 --> 02:28:02.573
DEALS WITH SOMETHING VERY

02:28:02.640 --> 02:28:05.276
IMPORTANT NOT A SHELTER IN

02:28:05.343 --> 02:28:07.712
PLACE IN A BUILDING. EDIT ASK

02:28:07.778 --> 02:28:09.080
TEACHERS TO DO A STUDY AND

02:28:09.146 --> 02:28:11.549
BRING FORTH GUIDELINES ON HOW

02:28:11.616 --> 02:28:12.149
WE SHOULD DEAL WITH SHELTER IN

02:28:12.216 --> 02:28:14.218
PLACE. AND THE PURPOSE OF THIS

02:28:14.285 --> 02:28:15.419
IS ISN'T THERE FOR ANOTHER

02:28:15.486 --> 02:28:17.822
STUDY BILL. BUT THE ROLE OF

02:28:17.888 --> 02:28:19.223
THIS STUDY BILL IS TO GET ON

02:28:19.290 --> 02:28:20.157
EVERYONE'S RADAR SCREEN WHAT

02:28:20.224 --> 02:28:21.792
ARE GOOD PRACTICES ON CHILDREN

02:28:21.859 --> 02:28:23.794
PLACE. SO AS WE ARE DEVELOPING

02:28:23.861 --> 02:28:25.196
PLANS FOR BUILDINGS REFERRED

02:28:25.263 --> 02:28:27.265
INTEGRATED IN EARLY. AND THAT

02:28:27.331 --> 02:28:29.267
MAKES US LESS EXPENSIVE SHORT

02:28:29.333 --> 02:28:30.268
IN A PLACE IS AN INTERESTING

02:28:30.334 --> 02:28:31.569
CONCEPT THERE ARE DIFFERENT

02:28:31.636 --> 02:28:35.039
VARIETIES OF IT. THE RESULT IN

02:28:35.106 --> 02:28:36.173
PLACE IN NEW CONSTRUCTION.

02:28:36.240 --> 02:28:37.341
WHICH CAN DEAL WITH SUCH THINGS

02:28:37.408 --> 02:28:39.543
AS- THE IDEA IS IF SOMETHING

02:28:39.610 --> 02:28:41.712
BAD HAPPENS. WHERE CAN YOU GET

02:28:41.779 --> 02:28:43.981
TO. SO THIS IS NOT A NEW

02:28:44.048 --> 02:28:45.883
CONVERSATION SINCE JANUARY SIX

02:28:45.950 --> 02:28:47.518
ON JANUARY SIX IT MAKES US ALL

02:28:47.585 --> 02:28:50.321
THINK ABOUT IT DIFFERENTLY. R.

02:28:50.388 --> 02:28:52.223
BUT IT'S WHAT IS THE WHAT MAKES

02:28:52.290 --> 02:28:53.224
FOR A SHELTER IN PLACE WHAT

02:28:53.291 --> 02:28:55.459
SORT OF RESILIENCE TO THAT PART

02:28:55.526 --> 02:28:56.861
OF THE BUILDING NEED TO HAVE.

02:28:56.927 --> 02:28:58.696
TO DEAL WITH RESISTANCE ARE

02:28:58.763 --> 02:29:00.298
THERE SYSTEMS COMMUNICATION

02:29:00.364 --> 02:29:03.534
SYSTEMS. ALARM SYSTEMS. IS

02:29:03.601 --> 02:29:04.635
THERE SOME NEED TO HAVE SOME

02:29:04.702 --> 02:29:07.071
SORT OF. BATHROOMS OR WATER OR

02:29:07.138 --> 02:29:08.472
THOSE SORTS OF THINGS THESE ARE

02:29:08.539 --> 02:29:09.874
ALL ELEMENTS TO KIND OF FIT

02:29:09.940 --> 02:29:12.043
INTO. A NEW CONSTRUCTION. IT'S

02:29:12.109 --> 02:29:13.144
ALSO RELEVANT IF YOU'RE

02:29:13.210 --> 02:29:14.145
ACTUALLY DOING A PROJECT

02:29:14.211 --> 02:29:16.280
AROUND. OLDER MORE VULNERABLE

02:29:16.347 --> 02:29:18.783
CONSTRUCTION. HOW CAN PEOPLE

02:29:18.849 --> 02:29:20.251
GET FROM A FOLDER STRUCTURE

02:29:20.318 --> 02:29:22.353
INTO A- SAFE AND SECURE PLACE.

02:29:22.420 --> 02:29:24.655
WHERE PEOPLE THE NOTED GO LOOK.

02:29:24.722 --> 02:29:27.291
IF SOMETHING HAPPENS. SO THIS

02:29:27.358 --> 02:29:30.294
IS- IT IS A SMALL TOPIC BUT I

02:29:30.361 --> 02:29:31.929
THINK IT'S ONE THAT'S PER MUCH

02:29:31.996 --> 02:29:32.663
AFFECT WITH THE PUBLIC

02:29:32.730 --> 02:29:35.099
INTEREST. IN PUBLIC BUILDINGS

02:29:35.166 --> 02:29:36.534
IT IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT

02:29:36.600 --> 02:29:38.669
BECAUSE- YOU KNOW. AS WE

02:29:38.736 --> 02:29:40.271
ARRIVED HERE IS MEMBERS CENTERS

02:29:40.338 --> 02:29:42.206

02:29:42.273 --> 02:29:43.174
SORT OF THE PUZZLE PALACE

02:29:43.240 --> 02:29:44.375
FINDING YOUR WAY AROUND THIS

02:29:44.442 --> 02:29:47.478
BUILDING IS CONFUSING. BUT PITY

02:29:47.545 --> 02:29:49.080
THE POOR PUBLIC CREWS HERE. YOU

02:29:49.146 --> 02:29:51.415

02:29:55.152 --> 02:29:56.354
THE FORCE CONNECT I MEAN THIS

02:29:56.420 --> 02:29:58.255
IS A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE IN

02:29:58.322 --> 02:30:00.324
PUBLIC BUILDINGS KIND OF

02:30:00.391 --> 02:30:02.693
ANTICIPATE THIS NEED SO. THAT

02:30:02.760 --> 02:30:05.196
