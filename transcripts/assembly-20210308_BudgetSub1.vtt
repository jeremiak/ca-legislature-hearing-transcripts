00:32:56.607 --> 00:32:57.909
MENTION THAT IMMIGRANT WMEN

00:32:57.975 --> 00:32:59.811
HAVE BEEN MOST AFFECTED OR MORE

00:32:59.877 --> 00:33:00.945
AFFECTED THAN THEIR WHITE

RETURN OR POSSIBILITY TO TURN

00:33:09.554 --> 00:33:11.122
TO THOSE JOBS AT ALL. I

00:33:11.189 --> 00:33:12.490
UNDERSTAND THE PUSH FROM

00:33:12.557 --> 00:33:13.424
COMMUNITIES IN ELECTED

00:33:13.491 --> 00:33:15.293

SENSE OF NORMAL AND TO BE IN

00:33:16.928 --> 00:33:18.830
OUR LONG NEEDED RECOVERY. BUT

00:33:18.896 --> 00:33:20.565
WE MUST NOT USE BACK TO NORMAL

00:33:20.631 --> 00:33:22.633
AS A STANDARD WE MUST GET BACK

00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:24.702

00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:29.841
SUCCESSFULLY WORKED WITH

00:33:29.907 --> 00:33:31.876
LEGISLATORS AND TWO GOVERNORS

00:33:31.943 --> 00:33:33.644

00:33:39.851 --> 00:33:40.952
ARE NOW HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS

00:33:41.018 --> 00:33:42.420
OF UNDOCUMENTED CALIFORNIANS

00:33:46.991 --> 00:33:49.093
ELIGIBLE. AS SUCCESSFUL AS

00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:50.928
THOSE CAMPAIGNS WERE THEY

00:33:50.995 --> 00:33:52.063
DIDN'T HAPPEN OVERNIGHT OR

00:33:52.130 --> 00:33:53.698
IMMEDIATELY. IT TOOK A PUSH

00:33:53.765 --> 00:33:54.966
FROM OUR IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES

00:33:55.032 --> 00:33:57.201
AND A VULNERABILITY TO SHARE

00:33:57.268 --> 00:33:57.902

00:34:00.171 --> 00:34:02.106
THE CAMPAIGNS THAT WE STARTED

00:34:02.173 --> 00:34:04.242
AND GROW FROM SOME TO ALL. THIS

00:34:04.308 --> 00:34:05.777
ISSUE IS ALSO TIMELY AS THERE

00:34:05.843 --> 00:34:07.612
IS A FEDERAL PARTNER IN THE

WHITE HOUSE AND A DEMOCRATIC

00:34:08.846 --> 00:34:10.348
CONGRESS. THAT POLITICAL

00:34:10.415 --> 00:34:11.516
ALIGNMENT MAY ALLOW FOR THE

00:34:11.582 --> 00:34:13.151
STATE TO START THE INVESTMENT

00:34:13.217 --> 00:34:14.852
IN HEALTH CARE EXPANSION AND

00:34:14.919 --> 00:34:16.254

HEALTHCARE TO EVERY

00:34:31.202 --> 00:34:32.904
CALIFORNIANS. BY ELIMINATING

00:34:32.970 --> 00:34:34.439
THE BARRIERS BASED ON WHERE

PRESENT TODAY ON THE REALLY

00:35:16.848 --> 00:35:21.285
IMPORTANT TOPIC. I WANTED TO

00:35:21.352 --> 00:35:23.321
START BY BRIEFLY ACKNOWLEDGING

00:35:23.387 --> 00:35:24.922
HOW INTEGRAL AND DOCUMENTED

00:35:24.989 --> 00:35:26.958
CALIFORNIANS ARE TO OUR STATE.

00:35:27.024 --> 00:35:28.726
THE TWO POINT ONE MILLION

00:35:28.793 --> 00:35:31.329
UNDOCUMENTED- CALIFORNIANS MAKE

00:35:31.395 --> 00:35:32.830
UP A SIGNIFICANT PART OF OUR

00:35:32.897 --> 00:35:36.267
WORK FORCE. THEY PAY BILLIONS

00:35:36.334 --> 00:35:38.202
OF DOLLARS IN TAXES EACH YEAR.

00:35:38.269 --> 00:35:39.770
AND MOST ARE LONG TERM

00:35:39.837 --> 00:35:41.572
RESIDENTS WITH STRONG ROOTS IN

00:35:41.639 --> 00:35:43.040
THE STATE AND THEY'RE AN

00:35:43.107 --> 00:35:45.042
IMPORTANT PART OF OUR

00:35:45.109 --> 00:35:47.445
COMMUNITIES AND OUR FAMILIES.

00:35:47.512 --> 00:35:49.881
BEFORE THE PANDEMIC AS WITH MY

00:35:49.947 --> 00:35:51.115
COLLEAGUES AT UC BERKELEY AND

00:35:51.182 --> 00:35:53.718
UCLA WE PROJECTED HOW MANY

00:35:53.784 --> 00:35:56.287
CALIFORNIANS WOULD BE UNINSURED

00:35:56.354 --> 00:35:58.656
AND TWENTY TWENTY TWO AFTER A

00:35:58.723 --> 00:36:00.625
D. IMPORTANT STATE ACTIONS WERE

00:36:00.691 --> 00:36:02.760
TAKEN TO REMOVE THE STATE

00:36:02.827 --> 00:36:04.362
CLOSER TO UNIVERSAL COVERAGE.

00:36:04.428 --> 00:36:07.265
WE ESTIMATED THAT THREE POINT

00:36:07.331 --> 00:36:09.200
FIVE MILLION CALIFORNIANS I

00:36:09.267 --> 00:36:11.569
WOULD BE UNANSWERED AFTER AS

00:36:11.636 --> 00:36:13.671
YOUNG ADULTS EXPANSION THE

00:36:13.738 --> 00:36:15.039

CALIFORNIA AND AFTER THIS STATE.

00:36:20.077 --> 00:36:21.512
MANDATE WAS IMPLEMENTED. BUT

00:36:21.579 --> 00:36:23.714
UNDOCUMENTED CALIFORNIANS AT

00:36:23.781 --> 00:36:25.449
MAKE UP THE LARGEST GROUP OF

00:36:25.516 --> 00:36:29.654
UNINSURED AS- AROUND ONE POINT

00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:31.589
THREE MILLION UNDOCUMENTED

00:36:31.656 --> 00:36:33.891
CALIFORNIANS ARE UNINSURED. AND

00:36:33.958 --> 00:36:35.426
THEY MAKE UP THE LARGEST GROUP

00:36:35.493 --> 00:36:37.862
BECAUSE THEY'RE EXCLUDED FROM

00:36:37.929 --> 00:36:40.097
ACA AND MEDICAID ELIGIBILITY

00:36:40.164 --> 00:36:42.633
UNDER FEDERAL POLICY AND

00:36:42.700 --> 00:36:44.368
UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS ARE LESS

00:36:44.435 --> 00:36:47.438
LIKELY TO BE OFFERED A JOB

TWENTY NINETEEN MY FAMILY AND I

00:37:37.288 --> 00:37:39.256
SUFFERED THE LOSS OF MY MOTHER

00:37:39.323 --> 00:37:41.592
IN LAW AFTER MONTHS OF TRYING

00:37:41.659 --> 00:37:43.694
EVERYTHING AVAILABLE TO US TO

00:37:43.761 --> 00:37:45.896
GET HER MEDICAL CARE. THE

00:37:45.963 --> 00:37:47.565
NATIONAL LEVEL ARRIVE IN

00:37:47.632 --> 00:37:49.700
ESCONDIDO CALIFORNIA OVER

00:37:49.767 --> 00:37:51.469
TWENTY YEARS SEVERAL. SHE BUILT

00:37:51.535 --> 00:37:55.139
A LIFE HERE WITH HER EIGHT KIDS-

00:37:55.206 --> 00:37:57.041
MY HUSBAND WHO WAS THE FIRST IN

00:37:57.108 --> 00:37:58.709
HIS FAMILY TO GRADUATE WITH A

00:37:58.776 --> 00:38:01.045
BACHELOR'S DEGREE. AND WEBER

00:38:01.112 --> 00:38:02.380
TOOK CARE OF HER KIDS

00:38:02.446 --> 00:38:03.681
GRANDCHILDREN AND EVEN

00:38:03.748 --> 00:38:05.616
COMMUNITY MEMBERS SHE WAS A

00:38:05.683 --> 00:38:07.918
COMMUNITY LEADER WHO ALWAYS

00:38:07.985 --> 00:38:09.887
STRIVE TO DEMONSTRATION. AND

00:38:09.954 --> 00:38:12.556
LOCAL HEARINGS. IT WAS NORMAL

00:38:12.623 --> 00:38:13.524
FOR THEM TO HANDLE THEM OUT TO

00:38:13.591 --> 00:38:15.559
GO MONTHS OR EVEN YEARS WITHOUT

00:38:15.626 --> 00:38:17.795
DOCTORS VISITS. MONTHS BEFORE

00:38:17.862 --> 00:38:19.430
HER DEATH SHE STARTED

00:38:19.497 --> 00:38:21.098
COMPLAINING OF STRONG ABDOMINAL

00:38:21.165 --> 00:38:23.834
PAIN SO WE TOOK HER TO THE

00:38:23.901 --> 00:38:25.770
LOCAL COMMUNITY CLINIC. NONE OF

00:38:25.836 --> 00:38:26.671
US COULD HAVE IMAGINED THE

00:38:26.737 --> 00:38:28.339
POSSIBILITY THAT WOULD SEEM

00:38:28.406 --> 00:38:30.441
LIKE A STOMACH PROBLEM WAS

00:38:30.508 --> 00:38:33.811
CALLED BLADDER CANCER. IT WAS A

00:38:33.878 --> 00:38:35.446
LONG PROCESS JUST TO GET HER

00:38:35.513 --> 00:38:37.448
CLOSE TO A DIAGNOSIS BECAUSE

00:38:37.515 --> 00:38:39.450
COMMUNITY CLINICS ARE NOT THE

00:38:39.517 --> 00:38:41.619
SIGN FOR THIS CASES. WE NEED A

00:38:41.686 --> 00:38:43.521
SPECIALIST AND TESTING THE

00:38:43.587 --> 00:38:46.157
CLINIC CAN OFFER. WE TRIED

00:38:46.223 --> 00:38:49.226
EVERY PLACE BUT MOST DON'T TAKE

00:38:49.293 --> 00:38:51.128
PEOPLE WITHOUT INSURANCE THE

00:38:51.195 --> 00:38:53.798
PRICES WERE TOO HIGH IN THE

00:38:53.864 --> 00:38:56.567
WAITING TIME WAS TOO LONG. AND

00:38:56.634 --> 00:38:58.369
WEBER KEPT COMING IN AND OUT OF

00:38:58.436 --> 00:39:00.204
THE LOCAL EMERGENCY ROOM. IT

00:39:00.271 --> 00:39:01.772
WAS ONLY AFTER SHE WENT TO THE

00:39:01.839 --> 00:39:06.243
ER AT UCSD MEDICAL CENTER SHE

00:39:06.310 --> 00:39:06.744
WAS ABLE TO GET A PROPER

00:39:06.811 --> 00:39:08.546
ASSESSMENT. AT THAT POINT THE

00:39:08.612 --> 00:39:10.081
DOCTOR WAS ABLE TO CONFRONT THE

00:39:10.147 --> 00:39:13.250
HARD TRUTH. THAT SHE HAD FINAL

00:39:13.317 --> 00:39:15.586
STAGE GALLBLADDER CANCER. THE

00:39:15.653 --> 00:39:16.987
DOCTORS THINK THAT THE CANCER

00:39:17.054 --> 00:39:18.422
HAD ALREADY BEEN SPREADING FOR

00:39:18.489 --> 00:39:20.791
OVER FIVE YEARS. THEY EXPLAINED

00:39:20.858 --> 00:39:22.760
TO US THAT THE EARLY SYMPTOMS

00:39:22.827 --> 00:39:24.762
COULD HAVE BEEN CONFUSED WITH

00:39:24.829 --> 00:39:26.731
DIGESTIVE PROBLEMS. THE

00:39:26.797 --> 00:39:28.132
NATIONAL WEBER HAD NEVER

00:39:28.199 --> 00:39:30.234
VISITED A DOCTOR FOR HER PAIN

00:39:30.301 --> 00:39:30.768
BECAUSE IT WAS OUT OF THE

00:39:30.835 --> 00:39:33.104
PROJECT. ONCE SHE HAD FINAL

00:39:33.170 --> 00:39:34.872
STAGE CNCER THERE WAS NOTHING

00:39:34.939 --> 00:39:37.942
WE COULD DO. NOVEMBER PASSED

00:39:38.008 --> 00:39:39.910
AWAY SURROUNDED BY ALL HER KIDS

00:39:39.977 --> 00:39:41.912
AND GRAND KIDS ON HER HOSPITAL

00:39:41.979 --> 00:39:45.316
BED AFTER TWO WEEKS OF FINALLY

00:39:45.382 --> 00:39:46.984
RECEIVING A MEDICAL TREATMENT.

00:39:47.051 --> 00:39:50.087
THOSE WERE THE LONGEST AND MOST

00:39:50.154 --> 00:39:53.190
PAINFUL WEEKS OF OUR LIVES. THE

00:39:53.257 --> 00:39:54.391
WOMAN WHO ARE TAKING CARE OF

00:39:54.458 --> 00:39:56.527
ALL OF US EVEN ME GOOD I'M SURE

00:39:56.594 --> 00:39:59.263
HER BLOOD WAS ON THE BED IN

00:39:59.330 --> 00:40:01.665
PAIN AND THERE WAS NOTHING WE

00:40:01.732 --> 00:40:04.201
COULD DO. WE ALL KEPT ASKING

00:40:04.268 --> 00:40:05.936
OURSELVES WHAT SHE COULD HAVE

00:40:06.003 --> 00:40:08.038
HAD THE OPPORTUNITY COUNT ON

00:40:08.105 --> 00:40:11.275
REGULAR DOCTORS VISITS. OR EVEN

00:40:11.342 --> 00:40:13.711
WHEN SHE FELT THE STOMACH PAIN.

00:40:13.778 --> 00:40:14.145
WHAT IS SHE WAS NOT

00:40:14.211 --> 00:40:16.847
UNDOCUMENTED DOES SHE HAVE

00:40:16.914 --> 00:40:19.383
HEALTH CARE COVERAGE. ACCESS TO

00:40:19.450 --> 00:40:21.285
HEALTH CARE IT'S A MATTER OF

00:40:21.352 --> 00:40:23.554
LIFE AND DEATH. GETTING A

00:40:23.621 --> 00:40:25.689
PROPER MEDICAL CARE EARLY COULD

00:40:25.756 --> 00:40:27.324
HAVE PREVENTED THE LOSS OF THE

00:40:27.391 --> 00:40:29.293
NATIONAL GUERRA A COMMUNITY

00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:32.029
LEADER WHO WAS THE HEART OF OUR

00:40:32.096 --> 00:40:34.365
FAMILY. WE WOULDN'T NEED TO SEE

00:40:34.431 --> 00:40:35.966
HER SUFFER WITHOUT A WAY OF

00:40:36.033 --> 00:40:37.434
PREVENTING OR STOPPING HER

00:40:37.501 --> 00:40:40.704
PAIN. WE WOULDN'T BE LEFT WITH

00:40:40.771 --> 00:40:43.007
UNPAID MEDICAL BILLS. MY FAMILY

00:40:43.073 --> 00:40:44.942
AND I ADVOCATE FOR HELPFUL FOR

00:40:45.009 --> 00:40:46.377
ALL BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT

00:40:46.443 --> 00:40:48.612
ANYBODY TO EVER EXPERIENCE WHAT

00:40:48.679 --> 00:40:50.614
WE WENT THROUGH. WE BELIEVE

00:40:50.681 --> 00:40:51.949
THAT EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE TO

00:40:52.016 --> 00:40:53.751
SUFFER OR DIE FROM A TREATABLE

00:40:53.818 --> 00:40:55.820
CONDITION NO MATTER WHERE THEY

00:40:55.886 --> 00:40:59.890
WERE BORN. THANK YOU. THANK YOU

00:40:59.957 --> 00:41:01.392
WILLIAM FOR YOUR TESTIMONY WE

00:41:01.458 --> 00:41:16.807
WILL NOW MOVE TO LAURA LUCIR.

00:41:16.874 --> 00:41:19.810
SERVING THE UNINSURED ESTIMATES

00:41:19.877 --> 00:41:23.247
THAT A WAS DISCUSSING I WERE

00:41:23.314 --> 00:41:25.449
PUBLISHED IN NOVEMBER TWENTY

00:41:25.516 --> 00:41:26.217
NINETEEN AND OF COURSE A LOT OF

00:41:26.283 --> 00:41:27.885
CIRCUMSTANCES HAVE CHANGED

00:41:27.952 --> 00:41:31.555
SINCE THEN. IT CALIFORNIA WE

00:41:31.622 --> 00:41:33.591
SENIOR AND MANY CALIFORNIANS

00:41:33.657 --> 00:41:35.893
LOSE JOB BASED COVERAGE DUE TO

00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:36.827
LOSING THEIR JOB DURING

00:41:36.894 --> 00:41:39.363
CONVENTION AS AND AT THE SAME

00:41:39.430 --> 00:41:41.031
TIME MEDICAL ENROLLMENT AND

00:41:41.098 --> 00:41:42.933
COVERED CALIFORNIA ENROLLMENT

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:45.736
HAVE GROUND. WE DON'T YET KNOW

00:41:45.803 --> 00:41:47.204
WHAT THE NET IMPACT OF THESE

00:41:47.271 --> 00:41:49.907
COVERAGE SHIFTS HAS BEEN ON THE

00:41:49.974 --> 00:41:50.441
NUMBER OF UNINSURED IN THE

00:41:50.507 --> 00:41:53.577
STATE- BUT WHAT'S MOST RELEVANT

00:41:53.644 --> 00:41:55.212
TO THIS CONVERSATION TODAY IS

00:41:55.279 --> 00:41:56.747
AS HOW HAS THE NUMBER OF

00:41:56.814 --> 00:41:59.350
UNDOCUMENTED AND UNINSURED

00:41:59.416 --> 00:42:02.920
ADULTS CHANGED- FIRST IT WE'VE

00:42:02.987 --> 00:42:04.488
HAD A POSITIVE CHANGE THAT

00:42:04.555 --> 00:42:06.724
BETWEEN JANUARY AND OCTOBER

00:42:06.790 --> 00:42:08.926
TWENTY TWENTY. EIGHTY THOUSAND

00:42:08.993 --> 00:42:11.562
CALIFORNIANS AGES NINETEEN TO

00:42:11.629 --> 00:42:12.162
TWENTY FIVE GAMES FULL SCOPE

00:42:12.229 --> 00:42:13.664
MEDICAL BENEFITS UNDER THE

00:42:13.731 --> 00:42:15.833
YOUNG ADULT EXPANSION. AND THAT

00:42:15.900 --> 00:42:18.535
EXPANSION IS ALREADY REFLECTED

00:42:18.602 --> 00:42:20.337
AND ARE UNINSURED ESTIMATES. ON

00:42:20.404 --> 00:42:22.740
THE OTHER HAND IT'S LIKELY THAT

00:42:22.806 --> 00:42:23.674
THERE WERE AND DOCUMENTED

00:42:23.741 --> 00:42:26.343
WORKERS. WHO LOST JOBS COVERAGE

00:42:26.410 --> 00:42:27.578
DURING THE PANDEMIC WHEN THEY

00:42:27.645 --> 00:42:29.680
LOST THEIR JOB WE DON'T KNOW

00:42:29.747 --> 00:42:32.016
HOW MANY- BUT EVEN BEFORE THE

00:42:32.082 --> 00:42:34.852
PANDEMIC FUEL AND DOCUMENTED

00:42:34.919 --> 00:42:36.954
WORKERS HAD JOB BASED COVERAGE

00:42:37.021 --> 00:42:41.425
TO BEGIN WITH. AS ON AS A WHOLE

00:42:41.492 --> 00:42:43.661
AND IT SEEMS VERY LIKELY TO ME

00:42:43.727 --> 00:42:46.297
THAT UNDOCUMENTED CALIFORNIANS

00:42:46.363 --> 00:42:48.399
HAVE CONTINUED TO MAKE UP THE

00:42:48.465 --> 00:42:51.101
LARGEST GROUP OF UNINSURED.

00:42:51.168 --> 00:42:55.105
EVEN DURING THE PANDEMIC.

00:42:55.172 --> 00:42:56.573
BEFORE THE PANDEMIC THERE IS

00:42:56.640 --> 00:42:57.975
CLEAR EVIDENCE THAT

00:42:58.042 --> 00:42:59.910
UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS WERE

00:42:59.977 --> 00:43:02.513
EXPERIENCING WORSE ACCESS TO

00:43:02.579 --> 00:43:03.948
CARE THIS IS DATA FROM

00:43:04.014 --> 00:43:06.350
COLLEAGUES AT UCLA THAT SHOWS

00:43:06.417 --> 00:43:10.287
THAT 44% OF UNDOCUMENTED LOW

00:43:10.354 --> 00:43:13.490
INCOME ADULTS. HEY DID NOT HAVE

00:43:13.557 --> 00:43:15.526
A U. S. USUAL SOURCE OF CARE.

00:43:15.592 --> 00:43:19.263
COMPARED 224% OF CITIZENS AND

00:43:19.330 --> 00:43:21.832
DOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS WITH THE

00:43:21.899 --> 00:43:27.404
SAME INCOME LEVEL. AND

00:43:27.471 --> 00:43:29.406
UNDOCUMENTED CALIFORNIANS HAVE

00:43:29.473 --> 00:43:31.408
BEEN HARD HIT BY COVERED BOTH

00:43:31.475 --> 00:43:33.310
ECONOMICALLY AND HEALTH WISE.

00:43:33.377 --> 00:43:35.546
WE DON'T HAVE DATA ON KOBE

00:43:35.612 --> 00:43:38.215
CASES AND DEATHS SPECIFICALLY

00:43:38.282 --> 00:43:41.051
BY IMMIGRATION STATUS BUT WE

00:43:41.118 --> 00:43:41.719
KNOW THAT NONCITIZEN

00:43:41.785 --> 00:43:44.588
IMMIGRANTS. LIKE ME AT TO HAVE

00:43:44.655 --> 00:43:46.857
CERTAIN RISK FACTORS FOR COBIZ

00:43:46.924 --> 00:43:48.592
INCLUDING RISK FACTORS RELATED

00:43:48.659 --> 00:43:51.328
TO WORK. A STUDY BY UCSF

00:43:51.395 --> 00:43:53.364
RESEARCHERS COMPARED THE ACTUAL

00:43:53.430 --> 00:43:55.032
TAX RATES FOR CALIFORNIA

00:43:55.099 --> 00:43:57.801
WORKING ADULTS AGE TWENTY FIVE

00:43:57.868 --> 00:44:00.204
AND UNDER DURING THE PANDEMIC

00:44:00.270 --> 00:44:02.206
TO THE EXPECTED DEATH RATES

00:44:02.272 --> 00:44:04.475
BEFORE THE PANDEMIC AND THEY

00:44:04.541 --> 00:44:06.643
FOUND THAT ON AVERAGE THE RISK

00:44:06.710 --> 00:44:09.013
OF DEATH. BUT FOR ALL

00:44:09.079 --> 00:44:12.316
CALIFORNIA ADULTS WITH 22%

00:44:12.383 --> 00:44:14.618
HIGHER DURING THE PANDEMIC- BUT

00:44:14.685 --> 00:44:16.520
IT WAS EVEN WORSE FOR THOSE WHO

00:44:16.587 --> 00:44:18.889
WORK IN OCCUPATIONS THAT ARE

00:44:18.956 --> 00:44:21.091
COMMON AMONG NON CITIZENS. WHAT

00:44:21.158 --> 00:44:22.993
THIS TABLE SHOWS IS THE FIVE

00:44:23.060 --> 00:44:28.065
TOP OCCUPATIONS. FOR NON

00:44:28.132 --> 00:44:28.799
CITIZEN WORKERS NATIONALLY. I

00:44:28.866 --> 00:44:33.003
FOR CUTS. AS THE MORTALITY RATE

00:44:33.070 --> 00:44:35.305
WAS 16% HIGHER DURING THE

00:44:35.372 --> 00:44:37.041
PANDEMIC COMPARED TO PRE

00:44:37.107 --> 00:44:38.942
PANDEMIC AND THAT WAS THAT THE

00:44:39.009 --> 00:44:40.411
OCCUPATION WITH THE VERY

00:44:40.477 --> 00:44:42.646
HIGHEST INCREASE AND THE DEATH

00:44:42.713 --> 00:44:45.883
RATES. I RECALL CHIRLA WORKERS-

00:44:45.949 --> 00:44:48.719
HAD A 55% INCREASE THE

00:44:48.786 --> 00:44:49.420
MORTALITY RATE DURING THE

00:44:49.486 --> 00:44:51.155
PANDEMIC FOR CONSTRUCTION

00:44:51.221 --> 00:44:52.623
LABORS IT WAS FORTY NINE

00:44:52.689 --> 00:44:56.093
PRESENTS AND FOR MAIDS AND

00:44:56.160 --> 00:45:01.265
HOUSEKEEPERS 33% LATINOS HAVE

00:45:01.331 --> 00:45:03.500
ALSO BEEN SEVERELY IMPACTED BY

00:45:03.567 --> 00:45:05.636
THE PANDEMIC THIS IS DATA FROM

00:45:05.702 --> 00:45:06.937
THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF

00:45:07.004 --> 00:45:08.839
PUBLIC HEALTH THAT REFLECTS ALL

00:45:08.906 --> 00:45:10.674
LATINOS THE VAST MAJORITY OF

00:45:10.741 --> 00:45:13.277
HIM ARE CITIZENS. HOWEVER

00:45:13.343 --> 00:45:15.746
APPROXIMATELY 86% OF

00:45:15.813 --> 00:45:17.948
UNDOCUMENTED CALIFORNIANS ARE

00:45:18.015 --> 00:45:20.651
LATINO SO THIS DATA. TELLS US

00:45:20.717 --> 00:45:23.754
SOMETHING BROADLY ABOUT HOW

00:45:23.821 --> 00:45:26.557
UNDOCUMENTED. LATINO ADULTS-

00:45:26.623 --> 00:45:29.059
HAVE FARED DURING THE PANDEMIC.

00:45:29.126 --> 00:45:31.095
WELL THAT HE KNOWS OF ALL AGES

00:45:31.161 --> 00:45:32.429
HAVE HAD HIGHER RATES OF

00:45:32.496 --> 00:45:34.731
TESTING POSITIVE FOR KOBE AND

00:45:34.798 --> 00:45:37.334
OF DYING FROM COPE IT AND THE

00:45:37.401 --> 00:45:39.736
DISPARITY IS ESPECIALLY SEVERE

00:45:39.803 --> 00:45:42.406
UP FOR OLDER LATINO ADULTS FOR

00:45:42.473 --> 00:45:44.608
THOSE AGES SIXTY FIVE TO

00:45:44.675 --> 00:45:47.411
SEVENTY NINE- THE CHINOS MADE

00:45:47.478 --> 00:45:49.413
UP ALMOST HALF OF THE KOBE

00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:56.153
DEATHS. BUT ONLY AT 822% OF THE

00:45:56.220 --> 00:45:58.255
POPULATION OF THAT AIDS. HE'S A

00:45:58.322 --> 00:45:59.990
DISPARITIES IN CODE RELATED

00:46:00.057 --> 00:46:01.959
OUTCOMES ARE THE LATEST EXAMPLE

00:46:02.025 --> 00:46:03.193
OF LONG STANDING HEALTH

00:46:03.260 --> 00:46:05.095
DISPARITIES FOR IMMIGRANTS FOR

00:46:05.162 --> 00:46:06.997
COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND FOR

00:46:07.064 --> 00:46:09.233
LOW INCOME PEOPLE IN THE STATE

00:46:09.299 --> 00:46:11.902
AND IN THIS COUNTRY. I LACK OF

00:46:11.969 --> 00:46:13.871
HEALTH INSURANCE IS LIKELY ONE

00:46:13.937 --> 00:46:16.473
OF MANY FACTORS THAT CONTRIBUTE

00:46:16.540 --> 00:46:20.377
TO THESE DISPARITIES. THERE'S

00:46:20.444 --> 00:46:22.412
AT LEAST ONE STUDIES THAT

00:46:22.479 --> 00:46:23.881
SUGGESTS THAT THERE'S AN

00:46:23.947 --> 00:46:27.417
ASSOCIATION BETWEEN OUR- IT AS

00:46:27.484 --> 00:46:29.887
AN INSURANCE RATES AND HIGHER

00:46:29.953 --> 00:46:32.089
CO THAT CASES AND DEATH RATES

00:46:32.156 --> 00:46:35.592
AND THAT'S- NOT SURPRISING

00:46:35.659 --> 00:46:38.095
GIVEN THE PAST RESEARCH. THAT

00:46:38.162 --> 00:46:40.130
HAS FOUND THAT HAVING INSURANCE

00:46:40.197 --> 00:46:41.832
IMPROVE PEOPLE'S USE OF

00:46:41.899 --> 00:46:44.001
PREVENTIVE CARE AND WHEN PEOPLE

00:46:44.067 --> 00:46:45.402
HAVE INSURANCE THEY GET MORE

00:46:45.469 --> 00:46:46.637
REGULAR CARE FOR THEIR CHRONIC

00:46:46.703 --> 00:46:49.072
CONDITIONS HAVING INSURANCE HAS

00:46:49.139 --> 00:46:50.374
BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH LOWER

00:46:50.440 --> 00:46:52.543
MORTALITY RATES. ELEMENT

00:46:52.609 --> 00:46:54.344
INSURANCE IMPROVES FINANCIAL

00:46:54.411 --> 00:46:56.180
SECURITY AND CREWS WORK FORCE

00:46:56.246 --> 00:46:58.582
PRODUCTIVITY AND OUR HEALTHCARE

00:46:58.649 --> 00:47:02.419
DELIVERY SYSTEMS ARE ALSO

00:47:02.486 --> 00:47:02.953
STRONGER WHEN EVERYONE IS

00:47:03.020 --> 00:47:05.956
INCLUDED. EXPANDING MEDICAL

00:47:06.023 --> 00:47:07.224
REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRATION

00:47:07.291 --> 00:47:09.760
STATUS IS A VERY WELL TARGETED

00:47:09.826 --> 00:47:12.763
POLICY. TO ACHIEVING OUR

00:47:12.829 --> 00:47:14.731
STATE'S GOAL OF MOVING CLOSER

00:47:14.798 --> 00:47:16.667
TO UNIVERSAL COVERAGE AND

00:47:16.733 --> 00:47:18.869
THAT'S BECAUSE A MAJORITY OF

00:47:18.936 --> 00:47:21.004
UNDOCUMENTED CALIFORNIANS WOULD

00:47:21.071 --> 00:47:22.372
BE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE

00:47:22.439 --> 00:47:24.942
HEALTH. BASED ON THEIR INCOME

00:47:25.008 --> 00:47:26.009
BUT FOR THEIR IMMIGRATION

00:47:26.076 --> 00:47:28.679
STATUS AND THAT THE VAST

00:47:28.745 --> 00:47:30.681
MAJORITY OF LOW INCOME

00:47:30.747 --> 00:47:33.183
CALIFORNIA UNDOCUMENTED ADULTS

00:47:33.250 --> 00:47:36.019
LACK INSURANCE AND VERY MUCH

00:47:36.086 --> 00:47:39.957
NEED THIS POLICY. I ESTIMATE

00:47:40.023 --> 00:47:42.659
THAT ONE POINT OH FOUR MILLION

00:47:42.726 --> 00:47:44.928
UNDOCUMENTED CALIFORNIA ADULTS

00:47:44.995 --> 00:47:47.097
WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE

00:47:47.164 --> 00:47:49.066
L. UNDER AN EXPANSION. AND THE

00:47:49.132 --> 00:47:50.734
VAST MAJORITY OF THOSE WHO

00:47:50.801 --> 00:47:52.569
WOULD BE ELIGIBLE ARE ALREADY

00:47:52.636 --> 00:47:54.605
ENROLLED AND RESTRICTED SCOPE

00:47:54.671 --> 00:47:56.607
MEDICS ALL. WHICH COVERS

00:47:56.673 --> 00:47:58.308
EMERGENCY AND PREGNANCY RELATED

00:47:58.375 --> 00:48:00.010
SERVICES USING FEDERAL AND

00:48:00.077 --> 00:48:02.145
STATE DOLLARS. AND THIS IS

00:48:02.212 --> 00:48:04.648
IMPORTANT FOR TWO REASONS FIRST

00:48:04.715 --> 00:48:06.650
IT MEANS THAT MOST OF THOSE

00:48:06.717 --> 00:48:09.453
ELIGIBLE CAN BE AUTOMATICALLY

00:48:09.519 --> 00:48:10.954
POSITIONS HAVE FULL BENEFITS

00:48:11.021 --> 00:48:12.422
WHEN THE POLICY IS IMPLEMENTED

00:48:12.489 --> 00:48:15.292
AS WAS DONE- WITH THE EXPANSION

00:48:15.359 --> 00:48:17.160
OF CHEN DOCUMENTED CHILDREN AND

00:48:17.227 --> 00:48:19.496
YOUNG ADULTS. AND SECONDLY THIS

00:48:19.563 --> 00:48:21.798
IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE A LARGE

00:48:21.865 --> 00:48:23.533
PART OF THE COST IS ALREADY

00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:26.103
BEING COVERED. GIVEN THAT

00:48:26.169 --> 00:48:28.138
EMERGENCY SERVICES AND

00:48:28.205 --> 00:48:29.806
PREGNANCY RELATED SERVICES ARE

00:48:29.873 --> 00:48:33.844
AMONG. THE MORE EXPENSIVE TYPES

00:48:33.910 --> 00:48:36.913
OF CARE. UNDER AN EXPANSION

00:48:36.980 --> 00:48:39.216
ESTIMATES THAT NEARLY NINE

00:48:39.283 --> 00:48:40.584
HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND

BEEN PRETTY STEADY AND WE ARE

COSTS RELATED TO THE CASE LOAD

01:06:02.992 --> 01:06:04.593
IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WERE-

01:06:04.660 --> 01:06:06.595
BUILT OFF OF TRENDS FROM ABOUT

01:06:06.662 --> 01:06:09.131
FOUR OR FIVE MONTHS- OF THE

01:06:09.198 --> 01:06:11.000
BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC OF

01:06:11.067 --> 01:06:13.035
BUT THINGS HAVE. EVOLVED SINCE

01:06:13.102 --> 01:06:14.303
THAT TIME AND WE HAVE A LOT

01:06:14.370 --> 01:06:16.238
MORE DATA SO THE DEPARTMENT-

01:06:16.305 --> 01:06:17.606
DOES CONTINUE TO LOOK AT MORE

01:06:17.673 --> 01:06:19.642
RECENT DATA AND ACTUALS AND

01:06:19.709 --> 01:06:21.444
WE'LL BE UPDATING OUR CODE

01:06:21.510 --> 01:06:23.079
NINETEEN CASELOAD PROJECTIONS-

01:06:23.145 --> 01:06:26.515
AFTER MAY REVISE TIME PERIOD.

01:06:26.582 --> 01:06:28.451
I'M SO THAT IS THE CONCLUSION

01:06:28.517 --> 01:06:31.153
OF OUR COMMENTS THANK YOU. NEXT

01:06:31.220 --> 01:06:33.155
WE WILL HEAR FROM NED RESNICK

01:06:33.222 --> 01:06:34.990
COUGH WITH THE LEGISLATIVE

01:06:35.057 --> 01:06:39.328
ANALYST'S OFFICE. HI GOOD

01:06:39.395 --> 01:06:41.931
AFTERNOON I'M GOING TO

01:06:41.997 --> 01:06:44.033
SUMMARIZE SOME OF OUR FINDINGS

01:06:44.100 --> 01:06:46.369
FROM OUR OFFICES ANALYSIS OF

01:06:46.435 --> 01:06:48.471
THE MEDIC HOW BUDGET FOR THE

01:06:48.537 --> 01:06:50.740
COMING YEAR- THE KEY PART OF

01:06:50.806 --> 01:06:52.908
OUR ANALYSIS WAS FOCUSED ON

01:06:52.975 --> 01:06:55.478
CASELOAD. BECAUSE CASELOAD

01:06:55.544 --> 01:06:57.546
GROWTH ACCOUNTS FOR A

01:06:57.613 --> 01:06:59.782
SIGNIFICANT PIECE OF YOUR OVER

01:06:59.849 --> 01:07:01.851
YOUR FUNDING EIGHT- IT IF YOUR

01:07:01.917 --> 01:07:02.952
OF YOUR FUNDING INCREASE IN THE

01:07:03.018 --> 01:07:05.521
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET OUT OF- FIVE

01:07:05.588 --> 01:07:06.589
POINT NINE BILLION DOLLAR

01:07:06.655 --> 01:07:08.424
INCREASE ABOUT TWO POINT SIX

01:07:08.491 --> 01:07:11.293
BILLION DOLLARS AS RELATED TO

01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:13.929
UNDERLYING CASE OF GROWTH. THE

01:07:13.996 --> 01:07:15.731
KEY TAKE AWAY OF OUR ANALYSIS

01:07:15.798 --> 01:07:18.701
IS WE THINK K. SO GROWTH WILL

01:07:18.768 --> 01:07:21.470
BE LOWER THAN THE- INSPIRATION

01:07:21.537 --> 01:07:23.606
PROJECTS AND IN FACT WE'RE

01:07:23.672 --> 01:07:25.174
EXPECTING CATHOLIC RELATED

01:07:25.241 --> 01:07:27.076
COSTS TO BE APPROXIMATELY ONE

01:07:27.143 --> 01:07:30.112
BILLION DOLLARS LESS THAN IS

01:07:30.179 --> 01:07:30.479
PROJECTED BY THE

01:07:30.546 --> 01:07:32.748
ADMINISTRATION. BUT HAVING SAID

01:07:32.815 --> 01:07:34.483
THAT WE ARE NOT RECOMMENDING

01:07:34.550 --> 01:07:35.818
MAKING ANY ADJUSTMENTS TO THE

01:07:35.885 --> 01:07:37.820
BUDGET RIGHT NOW I'D SAID WE

01:07:37.887 --> 01:07:40.189
RECOMMEND WAITING FOR ME WHEN

01:07:40.256 --> 01:07:41.924
WE SHOULD HAVE CONSIDERABLY

01:07:41.991 --> 01:07:44.193
MORE DATA ABOUT KISSING GROWTH

01:07:44.260 --> 01:07:46.762
OVER THAT THE COMING MONTHS TO.

01:07:46.829 --> 01:07:52.034
MAKE A MAKE AN ASSESSMENT. OF

01:07:52.101 --> 01:07:52.635
WHAT SHOULD BE GOING FORWARD.

01:07:52.701 --> 01:07:54.904
THE REASON WHY WE THAT AT- KIDS

01:07:54.970 --> 01:07:57.006
ARE GROWTH WILL BE LOWER AND

01:07:57.072 --> 01:07:58.974
THEREFORE COST LESS A PRIMARILY

01:07:59.041 --> 01:08:03.379
AS- WE THINK THAT IN ORDER FOR

01:08:03.446 --> 01:08:06.382
K. SO GROWTH LEVELS- IN ORDER

01:08:06.449 --> 01:08:09.652
FOR A- A CASELOAD GROWTH TO

01:08:09.718 --> 01:08:10.252
REACH THE LEVELS PROJECTED IN

01:08:10.319 --> 01:08:11.620
THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. MONTHLY

01:08:11.687 --> 01:08:13.389
CREASE CASELOAD GROWTH WE NEED

01:08:13.456 --> 01:08:15.858
TO INCREASE BY NEARLY FIFTY

01:08:15.925 --> 01:08:18.194
PERCENT- MORE THAN IT HAS ON

01:08:18.260 --> 01:08:19.595
AVERAGE DURING THE PANDEMIC

01:08:19.662 --> 01:08:22.498
THUS FAR FROM MARCH TO DECEMBER

01:08:22.565 --> 01:08:25.634
TWENTY TWENTY- SO- FROM LESS

01:08:25.701 --> 01:08:27.770
THAN A HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND

01:08:27.837 --> 01:08:29.038
NEW ENROLLEES PER MONTH WHICH

01:08:29.104 --> 01:08:30.339
IS DIDN'T EAT THE AVERAGE AS

01:08:30.406 --> 01:08:31.774
FAR WOULD HAVE TO INCREASE

01:08:31.841 --> 01:08:34.343
UNTIL NEARLY TO NEARLY TWO

01:08:34.410 --> 01:08:36.412
HUNDRED THOUSAND. WE FEEL LIKE

01:08:36.479 --> 01:08:38.747
THAT'S THE- WITHIN THE REALM OF

01:08:38.814 --> 01:08:42.351
POSSIBILITY BUT IT'S LIKELY A

01:08:42.418 --> 01:08:44.487
WORST CASE SCENARIO. I ALSO WE

01:08:44.553 --> 01:08:46.722
THINK THAT- LESS OF THE GROWTH

01:08:46.789 --> 01:08:49.024
WILL COME FROM- SENIORS AND

01:08:49.091 --> 01:08:50.726
PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES THAT

01:08:50.793 --> 01:08:51.760
IS PROJECTED BY THE

01:08:51.827 --> 01:08:53.929
ADMINISTRATION- BUT MORE

01:08:53.996 --> 01:08:56.098
LIKELY. MORE OF THE GROWTH WILL

01:08:56.165 --> 01:08:58.501
COME FROM FAMILIES AND CHILD

01:08:58.567 --> 01:09:00.302
THIS ADULTS FROM THE ACA

01:09:00.369 --> 01:09:02.505
OPTIONAL EXPANSION AND THOSE

01:09:02.571 --> 01:09:04.106
POPULATIONS ARE TYPICALLY LESS

01:09:04.173 --> 01:09:05.508
COSTLY TO COVER SO SAID THAT

01:09:05.574 --> 01:09:08.444
ALSO ACCOUNTS FOR SOME OF THE

01:09:08.511 --> 01:09:11.046
SAVINGS WE ANTICIPATE- BUT BUT

01:09:11.113 --> 01:09:13.048
AGAIN. THESE PROJECTIONS ARE

01:09:13.115 --> 01:09:15.951
SUBJECT TO UNCERTAINTY AND SO

01:09:16.018 --> 01:09:17.987
WE ARE NOT RECOMMENDING ANY

01:09:18.053 --> 01:09:20.689
ADJUSTMENTS AT THIS TIME UNTIL

01:09:20.756 --> 01:09:21.657
MORE DATA IS AVAILABLE TO

01:09:21.724 --> 01:09:25.127
REVIEW I THANK YOU AND I AM

01:09:25.194 --> 01:09:25.861

THANK YOU VERY MUCH WITH THE

01:09:27.763 --> 01:09:29.131
CONCLUSION OF THE PANEL I WILL

01:09:29.198 --> 01:09:31.600
NOW BRING IT UP TO THE DíAS TO

01:09:31.667 --> 01:09:33.035
SEE IF ANY MEMBERS. HAVE

01:09:33.102 --> 01:09:36.972
QUESTIONS. SEEING NONE I WILL

01:09:37.039 --> 01:09:39.575
BEGIN MY FIRST QUESTION WILL BE

01:09:39.642 --> 01:09:41.644
FOR THE STAKEHOLDERS BOTH JOSE

01:09:41.710 --> 01:09:44.079
TORE AS AN ORACLE THOMAS. I

01:09:44.146 --> 01:09:45.814
WANTED YOU TO HELP FRAME IT FOR

01:09:45.881 --> 01:09:48.784
US- YOUR EXPERIENCE WORKING

01:09:48.851 --> 01:09:50.886
WITH THE UNINSURED POPULATION.

01:09:50.953 --> 01:09:52.421
HOW ARE THESE POPULATIONS

01:09:52.488 --> 01:09:53.956
AFFECTED BY THE LACK OF HEALTH

01:09:54.023 --> 01:09:56.792
CARE ACCESS AND HOW ARE ALL OF

01:09:56.859 --> 01:09:58.427
US AFFECTED BY MILLIONS OF

01:09:58.494 --> 01:10:00.596
CALIFORNIANS LACKING ACCESS TO

01:10:00.663 --> 01:10:06.635
HEALTH CARE. HI THIS IS A

01:10:06.702 --> 01:10:07.670
HORRIBLE THOMAS FROM THE

01:10:07.736 --> 01:10:09.538
CALIFORNIA POLICY CENTER I'LL

01:10:09.605 --> 01:10:12.575
GO FIRST. AND YOU KNOW TO HOW

01:10:12.641 --> 01:10:15.277
THE POPULATION IS AFFECTED BY A

01:10:15.344 --> 01:10:16.545
LACK OF ACCESS TO HEALTH ARE I

01:10:16.612 --> 01:10:18.247
THINK WE'VE SEEN OVER THE LAST

01:10:18.314 --> 01:10:20.349
YEAR WHAT HAPPENS WITH COBIT

01:10:20.416 --> 01:10:21.750
AND FOR THOSE POPULATIONS THAT

01:10:21.817 --> 01:10:23.052
DO NOT UNDERSTAND. YOU KNOW

01:10:23.118 --> 01:10:24.820
THEIR PRIOR CONDITIONS OR THEIR

01:10:24.887 --> 01:10:27.056
HEALTH- BEING ADVERSELY

01:10:27.122 --> 01:10:28.924
AFFECTED BY THE COMORBIDITIES

01:10:28.991 --> 01:10:31.060
AND SO IF THEY HAD ACCESS OVER

01:10:31.126 --> 01:10:33.562
THE YEARS TO PREVENTATIVE CARE

01:10:33.629 --> 01:10:35.698
THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO ADDRESS

01:10:35.764 --> 01:10:37.232
THEIR NEEDS AND TO BE ABLE TO

01:10:37.299 --> 01:10:38.200
RESPOND ACCORDINGLY IN THE

01:10:38.267 --> 01:10:39.501
MIDST OF A GLOBAL HEALTH

01:10:39.568 --> 01:10:41.203
PANDEMIC WHETHER THAT IS.

01:10:41.270 --> 01:10:43.372
TAKING TIME AWAY FROM LIFE

01:10:43.439 --> 01:10:45.474
THREATENING WORK OR TRYING TO

01:10:45.541 --> 01:10:47.576
ENFORCE AND TO GET MORE

01:10:47.643 --> 01:10:49.144
PRECAUTIONS- FOR CONDITIONS

01:10:49.211 --> 01:10:50.446
THAT THEY KNOW PUT THEM AT

01:10:50.512 --> 01:10:53.549
GREATER RISK WHEN IT COMES TO

01:10:53.616 --> 01:10:57.152
THE GREATER POPULATION I THINK.

01:10:57.219 --> 01:10:57.753
WE COULD SAY THAT THE COST OF

01:10:57.820 --> 01:11:00.489
CARE. FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS DOES

01:11:00.556 --> 01:11:02.992
GO UP WHEN WE SEE THAT A LACK

01:11:03.058 --> 01:11:05.160
OF ACCESS TO PREVENTATIVE CARE.

01:11:05.227 --> 01:11:07.930
AND CLINIC VISITS. WOULD RESULT

01:11:07.997 --> 01:11:10.265
IN GREATER- YOU KNOW TRIPS TO

01:11:10.332 --> 01:11:12.501
EMERGENCY ROOM FOR CARE THAT

01:11:12.568 --> 01:11:14.003
MIGHT BE MORE EXPENSIVE BECAUSE

01:11:14.069 --> 01:11:15.137
IT HAS TO DEAL WITH LARGER

01:11:15.204 --> 01:11:16.138
CHRONIC CONDITIONS THAT ARE

01:11:16.205 --> 01:11:18.007
MORE ADVANCED STAGES- WHETHER

01:11:18.073 --> 01:11:20.876
THESE ARE THINGS LIKE- LIKE

01:11:20.943 --> 01:11:22.177
THREATENING ILLNESSES SUCH AS

01:11:22.244 --> 01:11:24.680
CANCER TO DEEPER STAGE. OR

01:11:24.747 --> 01:11:25.447
THINGS THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN

01:11:25.514 --> 01:11:28.651
ADDRESSED- WHETHER IT IS-

01:11:28.717 --> 01:11:30.319
ADVERSE HEALTH REACTIONS THAT

01:11:30.386 --> 01:11:31.687
HAPPEN WITH WORKFORCE OR

01:11:31.754 --> 01:11:33.555
WORKING CONDITIONS. THOSE ARE A

01:11:33.622 --> 01:11:34.923
COUPLE THAT I COULD THINK UP

01:11:34.990 --> 01:11:37.192
THE TOP OF MY HEAD I'LL- PASS

01:11:37.259 --> 01:11:39.995
IT ALONG TO MY PARTNER JOSE FOR

01:11:40.062 --> 01:11:43.766
SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS. YES

01:11:43.832 --> 01:11:45.567
OF COURSE THANK YOU R. O. N. TO

01:11:45.634 --> 01:11:48.137
ADD ON TO WHAT I HAVE A PARTNER

01:11:48.203 --> 01:11:51.006
OR JUST MENTION. THERE THE

01:11:51.073 --> 01:11:52.107
UNDOCUMENTED POPULATION DOES

01:11:52.174 --> 01:11:53.976
NOT HAVE ANY ACCESS TO PREVENT

01:11:54.043 --> 01:11:56.478
OR PRIMARY CARE SO WHEN DAISY

01:11:56.545 --> 01:11:59.248
HOW. ISSUE CRIME CONDITIONS

01:11:59.314 --> 01:12:01.417
SUCH AS DIABETES- DIABETES

01:12:01.483 --> 01:12:03.585
HEART DISEASE OR CANCER THEY'RE

01:12:03.652 --> 01:12:05.754
NOT ABLE TO GET IT TAKEN CARE

01:12:05.821 --> 01:12:08.390
OF AS IT AS IT SHOULD BE- FOR

01:12:08.457 --> 01:12:10.092
VARIOUS DISEASES THEY MIGHT USE

01:12:10.159 --> 01:12:11.527
THE EMERGENCY CARE BUT THEY

01:12:11.593 --> 01:12:14.596
CAN'T SEE. LONG TERM CARE AND-

01:12:14.663 --> 01:12:16.899
AT THE EMERGENCY ROOM SAME WITH

01:12:16.965 --> 01:12:19.868
IF THEY WORK IF THEY CONTRACT

01:12:19.935 --> 01:12:21.470
HOPE IT. UNDER THE UNDER THE

01:12:21.537 --> 01:12:23.639
CAR UNDER THE CURRENT STATUS

01:12:23.706 --> 01:12:24.940
THEY'RE ABLE TO GET ANYTHING

01:12:25.007 --> 01:12:27.109
THAT ANY MEDICAL CARE RELATED

01:12:27.176 --> 01:12:29.011
TO KOBE IT BY THEY'RE NOT ABLE

01:12:29.078 --> 01:12:29.912
TO ADDRESS ANY OTHER UNDERLYING

01:12:29.978 --> 01:12:33.015
CONDITIONS SO. AN OVERALL. IT'S

01:12:33.082 --> 01:12:34.083
JUST THESE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE

01:12:34.149 --> 01:12:36.218
SUFFERING FROM THIS LACK OF

01:12:36.285 --> 01:12:38.087
ACCESS AND IT WOULD BE

01:12:38.153 --> 01:12:38.587
SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE

01:12:38.654 --> 01:12:40.889
BENEFICIAL IN THE LONG TERM.

01:12:40.956 --> 01:12:43.459
WHERE WE- AN OFFICIAL LONG TERM

01:12:43.525 --> 01:12:45.527
WEAR DRESSING THESE CHRONIC

01:12:45.594 --> 01:12:47.696
CONDITIONS NOW WHAT STATE WOULD

01:12:47.763 --> 01:12:49.732
GO ON AND SAVE A STATE HEALTH

01:12:49.798 --> 01:12:52.234
CARE. COSTS IN THE FUTURE AS

01:12:52.301 --> 01:12:55.037
WELL. WITHOUT FRAMING I'D LIKE

01:12:55.104 --> 01:12:56.739
TO NOW TURN MY QUESTIONS TO THE

01:12:56.805 --> 01:12:59.541
LAUREL LUCIA AND I'M LOOKING AT

01:12:59.608 --> 01:13:02.544
PAGE SEVEN OF YOUR PRESENTATION

01:13:02.611 --> 01:13:05.214
HERE TODAY. AND REALLY LOOKING

01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:08.751
OUT THE PERCENT OF LATINOS

01:13:08.817 --> 01:13:10.152
COVERED CASES AND DEATHS

01:13:10.219 --> 01:13:11.620
COMPARED WITH THE PERCENTAGE OF

01:13:11.687 --> 01:13:13.722
THE POPULATION. AND WHAT'S

01:13:13.789 --> 01:13:15.557
STRIKING TO ME ARE ARE A NUMBER

01:13:15.624 --> 01:13:18.193
OF THINGS FIRST IS THAT THE

01:13:18.260 --> 01:13:21.263
LATINO POPULATION WHILE THIRTY

01:13:21.330 --> 01:13:22.331
EIGHT POINT 9% OF THE OVERALL

01:13:22.397 --> 01:13:25.000
CALIFORNIA. WE ONLY REPRESENT

01:13:25.067 --> 01:13:28.437
21% OF THOSE WHO ARE AGES SIXTY

01:13:28.504 --> 01:13:30.439
FIVE TO SEVENTY NINE. IS THAT

01:13:30.506 --> 01:13:32.307
BECAUSE OF OUR UNDERLYING

01:13:32.374 --> 01:13:34.209
HEALTH DISPARITIES IS THAT

01:13:34.276 --> 01:13:35.844
BECAUSE OF OUR LACK OF.

01:13:35.911 --> 01:13:38.013
PREVENTIVE HEALTH CARE ACCESS

01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:39.815
ARE YOU ABLE TO COMMENT ON WHY

01:13:39.882 --> 01:13:42.451
THERE'S SUCH A DISCREPANCY- IN

01:13:42.518 --> 01:13:48.891
THAT FIGURE. SURE EIGHT YEAH D.

01:13:48.957 --> 01:13:50.859
B. DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PRESS

01:13:50.926 --> 01:13:52.995
AND A PUBLIC CASES THAT ARE

01:13:53.061 --> 01:13:54.463
AMONG LATINOS AND THEIR SHARE

01:13:54.530 --> 01:13:59.368
POPULATION IS A- IT IS SEVERE

01:13:59.434 --> 01:14:00.669
ENOUGH ACROSS ALL AGES BUT

01:14:00.736 --> 01:14:03.138
PARTICULARLY AMONG THOSE WHO

01:14:03.205 --> 01:14:05.941
ARE SIXTY FIVE TO SEVENTY NINE.

01:14:06.008 --> 01:14:09.545
AND A- I THINK A LACK OF HEALTH

01:14:09.611 --> 01:14:12.581
INSURANCE IS ONE DRIVER OF THE

01:14:12.648 --> 01:14:14.116
OF THE TRANS RESTING HERE IT'S

01:14:14.183 --> 01:14:15.851
CERTAINLY NOT THE SOLE DRIVER

01:14:15.918 --> 01:14:18.720
OCCUPATIONAL RISKS ARE ANOTHER

01:14:18.787 --> 01:14:22.391
DRIVER- HOW DID HOUSING AND IS

01:14:22.457 --> 01:14:23.525
ANOTHER RISK FACTOR FOR CO

01:14:23.592 --> 01:14:26.328
THAT- ED THERE THERE ARE A

01:14:26.395 --> 01:14:27.329
NUMBER OF DIFFERENT FACTORS

01:14:27.396 --> 01:14:28.964
THAT UNDERLIE THIS BUT BUT

01:14:29.031 --> 01:14:30.199
HEALTH INSURANCE IS ONE OF

01:14:30.265 --> 01:14:32.868
THEM. AND THEN THE MECHANISM BY

01:14:32.935 --> 01:14:33.869
WHICH HEALTH INSURANCE COULD

01:14:33.936 --> 01:14:36.905
AFFECT COULD. SPREAD AND COPE

01:14:36.972 --> 01:14:41.577
WITH THE DEATH RATES AS IS THAT

01:14:41.643 --> 01:14:43.412
WE KNOW FROM PREVIOUS RESEARCH

01:14:43.478 --> 01:14:45.247
THAT WHEN PEOPLE HAVE INSURANCE

01:14:45.314 --> 01:14:46.682
THEY'RE MORE LIKELY TO GET THE

01:14:46.748 --> 01:14:48.717
CARE THEY NEED. AND IN THAT

01:14:48.784 --> 01:14:50.319
CASE A COVETED THAT'S COULD BE

01:14:50.385 --> 01:14:54.122
TESTING OR- FOR PEOPLE WHO

01:14:54.189 --> 01:14:57.626
ALREADY FEEL SICK WITH KOBE- IN

01:14:57.693 --> 01:14:58.794
GETTING THE CARE THEY NEED

01:14:58.861 --> 01:15:03.832
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE AND- WHEN

01:15:03.899 --> 01:15:06.101
PEOPLE. ARE HESITANT TO GET

01:15:06.168 --> 01:15:10.572
TESTING BECAUSE. OF COST A- YOU

01:15:10.639 --> 01:15:12.641
KNOW THEY- END UP AS A

01:15:12.708 --> 01:15:14.276
SPREADING IN THE AFFECTS ALL OF

01:15:14.343 --> 01:15:17.145
US AND- I HOPE THAT ADDRESSES

01:15:17.212 --> 01:15:20.215
THE QUESTION. IT'S CLOSE BUT I

01:15:20.282 --> 01:15:21.583
REALLY WANT TO DIG IN HERE A

01:15:21.650 --> 01:15:23.552
LITTLE BIT IT SEEMS THAT WE

01:15:23.619 --> 01:15:24.853
HAVE A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF

01:15:24.920 --> 01:15:27.089
COMBAT DEATHS FOR LATINO

01:15:27.155 --> 01:15:30.192
SENIORS AND- MY QUESTION IS

01:15:30.259 --> 01:15:31.727
THAT BECAUSE OF THE UNDERLYING

01:15:31.793 --> 01:15:33.295
HEALTH DISPARITIES THAT LACK OF

01:15:33.362 --> 01:15:35.931
PREVENTIVE CARE IS IT THAT.

01:15:35.998 --> 01:15:37.232
THEY HAVE UNTREATED DIABETES

01:15:37.299 --> 01:15:38.934
AND HYPERTENSION AND THAT WHEN

01:15:39.001 --> 01:15:41.169
THEY THEN GET COVE AND THEY

01:15:41.236 --> 01:15:43.005
HAVE A TENDENCY TO GET SICKER

01:15:43.071 --> 01:15:45.007
AND DIE SOONER IS THAT WHAT

01:15:45.073 --> 01:15:46.508
WE'RE SEEING BORN OUT IN THE

01:15:46.575 --> 01:15:49.478
STATE IS THAT- A TREND

01:15:49.544 --> 01:15:53.415
CONSISTENT. I THINK THAT. WHAT

01:15:53.482 --> 01:15:55.317
YOU'RE DESCRIBING IS DEFINITELY

01:15:55.384 --> 01:15:59.488
AN IMPORTANT FACTOR- A. EIGHT.

01:15:59.554 --> 01:16:01.223
D. A. I THINK A LOT MORE

01:16:01.290 --> 01:16:01.990
RESEARCH WOULD HAVE TOBE DONE

01:16:02.057 --> 01:16:05.160
SAID J. IDENTIFIED LIKE HOW

01:16:05.227 --> 01:16:07.296
EXACTLY HOW MUCH. THE LACK OF

01:16:07.362 --> 01:16:08.964
HEALTH INSURANCE IS DRIVING

01:16:09.031 --> 01:16:12.401
THESE. DISPARITIES BUT IT'S

01:16:12.467 --> 01:16:14.403
CERTAINLY AN IMPORTANT FACTOR.

01:16:14.469 --> 01:16:15.504
LET ME TRY AND APPROACH THE

01:16:15.570 --> 01:16:17.205
QUESTION AND FROM A DIFFERENT

01:16:17.272 --> 01:16:20.542
AND AN ECONOMIC WAY IF I CAN-

01:16:20.609 --> 01:16:22.711
DOES IT COST CALIFORNIA MORE OR

01:16:22.778 --> 01:16:24.546
LESS TO MAKE THE UP FRONT

01:16:24.613 --> 01:16:26.214
INVESTMENT IN EXPANDING

01:16:26.281 --> 01:16:28.083
INSURANCE COVERAGE TO PEOPLE.

01:16:28.150 --> 01:16:30.052
AS AN EXAMPLE DOES THE UP FRONT

01:16:30.118 --> 01:16:32.120
INVESTMENT RESULT IN SAVINGS IN

01:16:32.187 --> 01:16:33.956
THE LONG RUN WHAT IT. MAKES

01:16:34.022 --> 01:16:36.458
SENSE FOR US TO BE INVESTING IN

01:16:36.525 --> 01:16:37.926
PREVENTATIVE CARE SO WE DON'T

01:16:37.993 --> 01:16:39.261
HAVE THEIR UNDERLYING DIABETES

01:16:39.328 --> 01:16:41.630
AND HYPERTENSION THE OUT OF

01:16:41.697 --> 01:16:43.198
CONTROL AND HAVE THESE.

01:16:43.265 --> 01:16:44.566
OUTCOMES AND DISPARITIES THAT

01:16:44.633 --> 01:16:48.870
WE'RE SEEING. I THINK THE BEST

01:16:48.937 --> 01:16:51.239
RESULTS YEAR EXPANDS MEDICAL

01:16:51.306 --> 01:16:52.908
REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRATION

01:16:52.975 --> 01:16:54.910
STATUS IS THAT IT WILL IMPROVE

01:16:54.977 --> 01:16:56.912
PEOPLE'S ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE-

01:16:56.979 --> 01:16:58.180
AND THEREFORE IMPROVE THEIR

01:16:58.246 --> 01:17:01.817
HEALTH OUTCOMES. A IT WILL

01:17:01.883 --> 01:17:03.452
REQUIRE SOME STATE INVESTMENTS

01:17:03.518 --> 01:17:05.387
BECAUSE RESEARCH SHOWS THAT

01:17:05.454 --> 01:17:06.955
WHEN PEOPLE HAVE HEALTH

01:17:07.022 --> 01:17:09.725
INSURANCE THEY USE MORE CARE-

01:17:09.791 --> 01:17:11.126
AND THAT'S AND THAT'S

01:17:11.193 --> 01:17:12.227
CONSISTENT WITH THE GOAL WE'RE

01:17:12.294 --> 01:17:14.896
TRYING TO ACHIEVE. WHICH IS AS

01:17:14.963 --> 01:17:16.331
REDUCING BARRIERS TO CARE BASED

01:17:16.398 --> 01:17:18.967
ON ON COSTS AND INSURANCE

01:17:19.034 --> 01:17:22.504
STATUS I AM. THERE IS CERTAINLY

01:17:22.571 --> 01:17:28.110
ARE ARE CASES WHERE- IT. HEALTH

01:17:28.176 --> 01:17:30.078
EXPENDITURES WILL BE LOWER WHEN

01:17:30.145 --> 01:17:31.847
YOU GET THE PREVENTATIVE CARE

01:17:31.913 --> 01:17:33.448
YOU NEED BUT THERE ARE ALSO

01:17:33.515 --> 01:17:35.984
CASES WHERE- HEALTHCARE

01:17:36.051 --> 01:17:38.186
EXPENDITURES COULD BE HIGHER

01:17:38.253 --> 01:17:39.688
BUT THE OUTCOMES ARE BETTER.

01:17:39.755 --> 01:17:41.590
LOOK AT THE CANCER SCREENING

01:17:41.656 --> 01:17:44.292
THEY NEED AT THE RIGHT TIME- IT

01:17:44.359 --> 01:17:45.827
MAY IDENTIFY MORE CANCER CASES

01:17:45.894 --> 01:17:47.729
BUT WE'LL SEE PEOPLE LIVING

01:17:47.796 --> 01:17:49.664
LONGER HEALTHIER LIVES WHICH IS

01:17:49.731 --> 01:17:52.267
ULTIMATELY THE CALL. AND I ALSO

01:17:52.334 --> 01:17:56.271
AM. SEE THISAS A INVESTMENT

01:17:56.338 --> 01:17:58.040
AND REDUCING INEQUITY IN THE

01:17:58.106 --> 01:18:00.609
STATE- THE BIGGEST GROUPS OF

01:18:00.675 --> 01:18:02.577
UNINSURED. BY ELIGIBILITY

01:18:02.644 --> 01:18:04.146
STATUS OF COURSE AS I SAID IN

01:18:04.212 --> 01:18:05.747
MY PRESENTATION ARE

01:18:05.814 --> 01:18:07.482
UNDOCUMENTED CALIFORNIANS BUT

01:18:07.549 --> 01:18:10.986
WHEN WE COME AS- A CALIFORNIANS

01:18:11.053 --> 01:18:13.488
ARE. ANOTHER BIG GROUP OF

01:18:13.555 --> 01:18:15.257
UNINSURED AS ARE LATINO

01:18:15.323 --> 01:18:18.994
CALIFORNIANS AND SO- EXPANDING

01:18:19.061 --> 01:18:20.195
MEDIC HOW WOULD TAKE SOME STATE

01:18:20.262 --> 01:18:22.831
INVESTMENT BUT IT WOULD BE- AND

01:18:22.898 --> 01:18:24.366
INVESTMENT INDIVIDUALS WHO

01:18:24.433 --> 01:18:25.767
CURRENTLY LACK COVERAGE TODAY

01:18:25.834 --> 01:18:27.536
WHICH HAS BEEN TALKING ABOUT

01:18:27.602 --> 01:18:29.638
BENEFITS US ALL AND IT WOULD

01:18:29.704 --> 01:18:33.909
ALSO BE AN INVESTMENT. IN

01:18:33.975 --> 01:18:35.143
REDUCING INEQUITIES. IF I COULD

01:18:35.210 --> 01:18:36.745
BRING YOU BACK TO THIS. THAN I

01:18:36.812 --> 01:18:38.113
WAS HOPING THAT- YOU CAN

01:18:38.180 --> 01:18:40.449
SPECIFICALLY TALK ABOUT HOW YOU

01:18:40.515 --> 01:18:42.451
ARE RECOMMENDING TO TAKE STEPS

01:18:42.517 --> 01:18:44.519
TOWARDS UNIVERSAL COVERAGE. ARE

01:18:44.586 --> 01:18:46.521
YOU RECOMMENDING A PHASED IN

01:18:46.588 --> 01:18:47.889
APPROACH STARTING WITH SENIORS

01:18:47.956 --> 01:18:50.926
THIS YEAR AND IF SO WHAT WOULD

01:18:50.992 --> 01:18:56.465
BE THE NEXT PHASES. THANK YOU

01:18:56.531 --> 01:18:57.532
AT CHAIR AROUND OF THAT

01:18:57.599 --> 01:18:59.468
QUESTION I THINK WE HAVE LOOKED

01:18:59.534 --> 01:19:01.169
AT SENIORS BEING THE DOWN

01:19:01.236 --> 01:19:02.404
PAYMENT AND THAT YOU'VE

01:19:02.471 --> 01:19:03.805
DESCRIBED THAT SEVERAL TIMES

01:19:03.872 --> 01:19:05.941
OVER THIS YEAR. I AND AS FAR AS

01:19:06.007 --> 01:19:07.576
WHERE THE NEXT STEPS GO IT'S

01:19:07.642 --> 01:19:08.710
SOMETHING THAT WE REALLY NEED

01:19:08.777 --> 01:19:10.579
TO FOCUS ON WITH OUR COMMUNITY

01:19:10.645 --> 01:19:12.214
AND SEE WHERE THEIR HEADS ARE

01:19:12.280 --> 01:19:13.949
AT AND WHERE THEY THINK IS THE

01:19:14.015 --> 01:19:17.085
BEST QUALITIES POLICY DECISION.

01:19:17.152 --> 01:19:17.552
FOR THE AND DOCUMENTED

01:19:17.619 --> 01:19:21.590
POPULATION. IF I COULD I NOW

01:19:21.656 --> 01:19:22.858
WANT TO BRING IT TO THE

01:19:22.924 --> 01:19:25.861
ADMINISTRATION AND TO- DIRECTOR

01:19:25.927 --> 01:19:31.032
LIGHT BORN AND- HI I WAS STRUCK

01:19:31.099 --> 01:19:32.234
DIRECTOR LIGHT BORN THAT THIS

01:19:32.300 --> 01:19:34.603
IS THE LARGEST ANTI POVERTY

01:19:34.669 --> 01:19:39.441
PROGRAM WE HAVE AND- I THINK

01:19:39.508 --> 01:19:40.876
THAT'S A POWERFUL STATEMENT

01:19:40.942 --> 01:19:44.212
ANYONE AYE- THINK IS IMPORTANT

01:19:44.279 --> 01:19:45.580
WHEN YOU REPRESENT UNDOCUMENTED

01:19:45.647 --> 01:19:47.682
COMMUNITY LIKE MINE WHO YOU

01:19:47.749 --> 01:19:49.217
HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE STRUGGLING

01:19:49.284 --> 01:19:51.319
TO MAKE ENDS MEET FOR US TO

01:19:51.386 --> 01:19:52.420
EFFECTIVELY WORK ON ANTI

01:19:52.487 --> 01:19:54.089
POVERTY PROGRAMS THAT ARE ALSO

01:19:54.156 --> 01:19:55.457
HELPING ARE UNDOCUMENTED

01:19:55.524 --> 01:19:58.026
COMMUNITY MATTERS FOR MANY OF

01:19:58.093 --> 01:19:59.928
US HERE ON THE DYESS. BUT I

ABOUT WITH THE SUSPENSIONS

01:40:54.815 --> 01:40:57.384
WHETHER OR NOT YOU BELIEVE THAT

01:40:57.451 --> 01:40:59.219
PROP FIFTY SIX REACHES ITS FULL

01:40:59.286 --> 01:41:01.188
POTENTIAL IN TERMS OF

01:41:01.255 --> 01:41:03.223
ATTRACTING AND RETAINING

PROVIDERS INTO THE MEDICAL

01:41:04.324 --> 01:41:06.627
PROGRAM. COULD WE DO BETTER

01:41:06.693 --> 01:41:08.295
WITH MORE CERTAIN LONG TERM

01:41:08.362 --> 01:41:10.898
PROVIDER RATES AND SUPPLEMENTAL

CALIFORNIANS THING IS VERY

01:41:18.605 --> 01:41:21.608
COMPLICATED- WE HAVE A BASE

01:41:21.675 --> 01:41:23.210
RATES- AND THEN WE HAVE A LARGE

01:41:23.277 --> 01:41:26.113
NUMBER OF. A BOTH SUPPLEMENTAL

PAY FOR OUR DELIVERY SYSTEM-

01:41:34.421 --> 01:41:36.390
AND SO I THINK WE ARE ALWAYS

01:41:36.457 --> 01:41:38.091
LOOKING TO EVALUATE HOW WE CAN

01:41:38.158 --> 01:41:40.360
ENSURE WE HAVE. A NETWORK

01:41:40.427 --> 01:41:41.462

WELL AS SOME OF THE OTHER

01:41:47.301 --> 01:41:49.169
CRITICAL SERVICES THAT- ARE

01:41:49.236 --> 01:41:50.504
RECEIVING SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS

01:41:50.571 --> 01:41:52.206
FROM PROP FIFTY SIX. I THINK

01:41:52.272 --> 01:41:53.841
THAT'S WHY YOU DIDN'T SEE-

01:41:53.907 --> 01:41:55.943
CERTAIN PIECES- BEING

01:41:56.009 --> 01:41:57.911
HIGHLIGHTED ADDS NOT SUBJECT TO

01:41:57.978 --> 01:42:00.247
SUSPENSION AND OR AREAS WHERE

01:42:00.314 --> 01:42:01.782
WE DON'T EEN FEEL LIKE CMS

01:42:01.849 --> 01:42:04.017
WOULD ALLW FOR- THE TRANSITION

01:42:04.084 --> 01:42:05.853
OUT OF SUCH POP- YOU KNOW

01:42:05.919 --> 01:42:06.987
SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS BECAUSE

01:42:07.054 --> 01:42:08.689
OF HOW CRITICAL THEY ARE. WE

01:42:08.755 --> 01:42:10.657
CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THE

01:42:10.724 --> 01:42:13.227
EFFECTIVENESS OF THE OF ALL

01:42:13.293 --> 01:42:15.095
PROPERTY SIX PIECES AND I LOOK

01:42:15.162 --> 01:42:16.263
FORWARD TO ENGAGING WITH THE

01:42:16.330 --> 01:42:19.700
LEGISLATURE. AS WE CONTINUE

01:42:19.766 --> 01:42:20.601
THOSE EVALUATIONS. I WILL

01:42:20.667 --> 01:42:22.803
SIMPLY STATES- THE FITS AND

01:42:22.870 --> 01:42:24.304
STARTS MAKE. COULD MAKE IT

01:42:24.371 --> 01:42:25.973
DIFFICULT FOR THOSE PROVIDERS

01:42:26.039 --> 01:42:29.142
TO IMPLEMENT. EFFECTIVELY AND-

01:42:29.209 --> 01:42:31.044
FOR BETTER LONG TERM PLANNING

01:42:31.111 --> 01:42:32.279
WOULD BE NICE TO GIVE THEM THAT

01:42:32.346 --> 01:42:35.582
CLARITY- BUT- WITH THAT I WILL

01:42:35.649 --> 01:42:38.852
TURN OVER QUESTIONS TO-

01:42:38.919 --> 01:42:41.622
ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUBIO. THANK

01:42:41.688 --> 01:42:44.424
YOU I'M BEING THAT- WE'VE BEEN

01:42:44.491 --> 01:42:45.759
IN LAW THIS IS MY FOURTH YEAR

01:42:45.826 --> 01:42:47.694
ON THIS COMMITTEE AND THEN.

01:42:47.761 --> 01:42:51.331
THIS WHOLE- SOME SUSPENSION NON

01:42:51.398 --> 01:42:52.966
SUSPENSION IS REALLY CONFUSING

01:42:53.033 --> 01:42:55.235
AND- THE ONLY THING THAT I

01:42:55.302 --> 01:42:56.603
WOULD OR THE ONE OF THE THINGS

01:42:56.670 --> 01:42:57.638
THAT I WOULD LIKE TO SAY IS

01:42:57.704 --> 01:42:59.206
THAT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO YOU

01:42:59.273 --> 01:43:01.575
KNOW I PUT MY SITUATION- MYSELF

01:43:01.642 --> 01:43:03.977
IN THE OF THE PLACE OF FOLKS.

01:43:04.044 --> 01:43:05.112
KIND OF IN MY OWN PERSONAL

01:43:05.178 --> 01:43:08.348
BUDGET- AND MY OWN KIND OF

01:43:08.415 --> 01:43:09.383
INCOME AND IT'S VERY DIFFICULT

01:43:09.449 --> 01:43:12.085
TO PLAN- YOU KNOW ANYTHING

01:43:12.152 --> 01:43:13.487
ABOUT LOOKING FORWARD IF

01:43:13.554 --> 01:43:15.155
THEY'RE UNDER THREAT OF. IT'S

01:43:15.222 --> 01:43:16.757
BEEN SUSPENDED NOT SUSPENDED

01:43:16.823 --> 01:43:18.091
YOU KNOW. AGAIN IT'S VERY

01:43:18.158 --> 01:43:20.427
CONFUSING. BUT I THINK THAT THE

01:43:20.494 --> 01:43:21.929
BOTTOM LINE IS THAT WE NEED TO

01:43:21.995 --> 01:43:23.764
MAKE SURE THAT. THE PROVIDERS

01:43:23.830 --> 01:43:27.067
pPAYMENTS SO THAT THEY CAN

01:43:27.134 --> 01:43:30.103
CONTINUE- THE SERVICES TO OUR

01:43:30.170 --> 01:43:32.139
COMMUNITIES. HOWEVER WE DONT

01:43:32.205 --> 01:43:33.607
SUSPENDED OR SUSPENDED HOWEVER

01:43:33.674 --> 01:43:34.908
WE WANT TO SAY IT BECAUSE AGAIN

01:43:34.975 --> 01:43:36.276
IT'S REALLY CONFUSING BUT THE

01:43:36.343 --> 01:43:37.711
POINT IS THAT WE NEED TO MAKE

01:43:37.778 --> 01:43:39.947
SURE THAT. THAT THESE PAYMENTS-

01:43:40.013 --> 01:43:42.049
ARE STEADY SO THAT- NOT ONLY

01:43:42.115 --> 01:43:43.216
THE PROVIDERS CAN PLAN FOR THE

01:43:43.283 --> 01:43:44.518
FUTURE BUT AT LEAST WE HAVE

01:43:44.585 --> 01:43:46.353
SOME ASSURANCES THAT OUR

01:43:46.420 --> 01:43:46.920
COMMUNITIES ARE GETTING THE

01:43:46.987 --> 01:43:49.356
SERVICES THAT THEY NEED- AND

01:43:49.423 --> 01:43:50.657
THE ONLY WAY TO GET. THOSE

01:43:50.724 --> 01:43:52.225
SERVICES AS BY MAKING SURE THAT

01:43:52.292 --> 01:43:55.162
PROVIDERS. HAVE WHAT THEY NEED

01:43:55.228 --> 01:43:57.931
TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE SERVICES-

01:43:57.998 --> 01:43:59.132
SO IT'S AGAIN IT'S VERY

01:43:59.199 --> 01:44:00.467
DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND AND I

01:44:00.534 --> 01:44:01.902
THINK. YOU KNOW IN SOME

01:44:01.969 --> 01:44:02.936
INSTANCES I THINK IT'S ON

01:44:03.003 --> 01:44:06.907
PURPOSE I'M NOT SAYING BAGHDAD.

01:44:06.974 --> 01:44:08.875
THAT THAT. THIS IS INTENTIONAL

01:44:08.942 --> 01:44:14.381
HOWEVER THE CONFUSION. S. IS

01:44:14.448 --> 01:44:17.084
ARE NOT JUST FOR ME BUT I THINK

01:44:17.150 --> 01:44:18.986
FOR OUR FOLKS THEY NEED THOSE

01:44:19.052 --> 01:44:21.221
SERVICES. ONE ONE. YEAR THEY

01:44:21.288 --> 01:44:22.456
CAN GET SERVICES THE NEXT YEAR

01:44:22.522 --> 01:44:24.391
THEY CAN'T AND SO. WE NEED SOME

01:44:24.458 --> 01:44:26.393
STABILITY AND I'M PLEADING WITH

01:44:26.460 --> 01:44:27.394
THE COMMITTEE AND I'M PLANNING

01:44:27.461 --> 01:44:28.595
WITH WITH THE YOU KNOW KIND OF

01:44:28.662 --> 01:44:30.530
ANYBODY THAT'S IN CHARGE OF

01:44:30.597 --> 01:44:32.599
THESE PROGRAMS THAT. WE CAN'T.

01:44:32.666 --> 01:44:34.901
OF HAVE THESE ISSUES HANGING

01:44:34.968 --> 01:44:36.403
OVER PEOPLE'S HEADS BECAUSE IN

01:44:36.470 --> 01:44:37.204
THE SERVICES ARE NOT BEING

01:44:37.270 --> 01:44:39.673
PROVIDED- TO LOOK AT THE END OF

01:44:39.740 --> 01:44:40.874
THE DAY THAT SERVICE IS NOT ARE

01:44:40.941 --> 01:44:42.175
NOT BEING PROVIDED TO OUR

01:44:42.242 --> 01:44:43.644
COMMUNITY SO. AGAIN I PLEAD

APPROPRIATELY MOVING FORWARD WE

PROJECTED TO NOT BE THAT GREAT.

01:44:58.992 --> 01:45:00.527
BUT IF WE DON'T PROVIDE THE

01:45:00.594 --> 01:45:03.563
SERVICES TO OUR COMMUNITY THEN.

REPRESENTATION HI I WONDER HAS

01:45:16.476 --> 01:45:18.245
THE DEPARTMENT EVER CONSIDERED

01:45:18.311 --> 01:45:21.248
LOOKING AT THIS ISSUE ON A

01:45:21.314 --> 01:45:24.017
MULTI YEAR BASIS FOR EXAMPLE A

01:45:24.084 --> 01:45:24.918
COUPLE OF YEARS INSTEAD OF A

01:45:24.985 --> 01:45:27.754
SINGLE YEAR- YOU KNOW YEAH I

01:45:27.821 --> 01:45:28.655
THINK YOU ALL KNOW THE HISTORY

01:45:28.722 --> 01:45:30.691
I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE KNOW

01:45:30.757 --> 01:45:32.259
THE HISTORY THAT. THAT

01:45:32.325 --> 01:45:33.860
SENSUALLY THE STAKEHOLDERS TO

01:45:33.927 --> 01:45:35.362
PUT PROP FIFTY SIX TOGETHER

01:45:35.429 --> 01:45:36.730
WE'RE TOLD THAT YOU KNOW THERE

01:45:36.797 --> 01:45:37.964
REALLY ISN'T MONEY IN THE STATE

01:45:38.031 --> 01:45:39.833
BUDGET TEAM INCREASE RATES AND

01:45:39.900 --> 01:45:41.601
SO. THE CHALLENGE WAS TO GO OUT

01:45:41.668 --> 01:45:42.869
AND FIND REVENUE SOURCE WHICH

01:45:42.936 --> 01:45:44.871
THEY DID AND PASS THIS PASSED

01:45:44.938 --> 01:45:47.240
AS PROPOSITION. WHICH HAS NOW

01:45:47.307 --> 01:45:49.443
BEEN YOU KNOW USED IN DIFFERENT

01:45:49.509 --> 01:45:52.579
WAYS- NOT ALWAYS TO THE INTENT

01:45:52.646 --> 01:45:53.613
OF THAT WELL WHAT HOW IT WAS

01:45:53.680 --> 01:45:56.483
WRITTEN. SO KNOWING THAT YOU

01:45:56.550 --> 01:45:58.518
KNOW THAT IT'S CHALLENGING TO

01:45:58.585 --> 01:46:00.687
GET PROVIDERS TO PARTICIPATE

01:46:00.754 --> 01:46:03.156
LONG TERM. IS THERE ANY

01:46:03.223 --> 01:46:05.559
POSSIBILITY THAT DEPARTMENT OF

01:46:05.625 --> 01:46:07.160
FINANCE COULD NOT LOOK AT THIS

01:46:07.227 --> 01:46:09.162
AS A LINE ITEM BUT LOOK AT IT

01:46:09.229 --> 01:46:11.264
IN WHOLE MORE HOLISTICALLY. AS

01:46:11.331 --> 01:46:13.600
AN INVESTMENT IN TREATING THE

01:46:13.667 --> 01:46:15.535
MOST NEEDY POPULATION OF OUR

01:46:15.602 --> 01:46:17.604
STATE. AND LOOK AT THIS AND

01:46:17.671 --> 01:46:20.707
FIND CONSIDER FINDING THIS ON A

01:46:20.774 --> 01:46:29.015
MULTI YEAR BASIS. ALL THE PARTS

01:46:29.082 --> 01:46:30.250
YOU ARE COLLEAGUES AT THE

01:46:30.317 --> 01:46:38.992

REQUIREMENTS LININGS THE-

01:46:40.660 --> 01:46:41.962
SUSPENSIONS ARE AN EXTENSION OF

01:46:42.028 --> 01:46:43.463
THE STATE LIGHTS SUSPENSIONS

01:46:43.530 --> 01:46:45.799
REMARKS. BY THE LEGISLATURE AND

01:46:45.866 --> 01:46:47.300
ADMINISTRATION WILL MARK MY

01:46:47.367 --> 01:46:48.902
WORDS BACK WORKABLE ISN'T

01:46:48.969 --> 01:46:50.904
STANDING AT BY ONE ADDITIONAL

01:46:50.971 --> 01:46:53.140
YEAR AND WE NEED TO LOOK AT IT

01:46:53.206 --> 01:46:54.975
AND NOT. WHAT ARE YOUR THE L.

01:46:55.041 --> 01:46:57.511
A. O. AND THEN MOST RECENTLY WE

01:46:57.577 --> 01:46:58.645
ARE THE STATE APPEARS TO BE

01:46:58.712 --> 01:47:00.013
FIGHTING FOR A LARGE BUDGET

DEFICITS WALMART SUSPENSIONS

01:47:02.115 --> 01:47:03.450
REMARKED AS NECESSARY TO

01:47:03.517 --> 01:47:09.856
MITIGATE THIS BUDGET. BUDGET

01:47:09.923 --> 01:47:12.159
DEFICITS. BRING SEASONS FROM

01:47:12.225 --> 01:47:13.693
FRAMEWORK RESULT IN THE STATE

OF THE- TO MAKE THE SOLDIERS

01:47:17.030 --> 01:47:20.934
AND. APOLOGIES COMMITTEE

WORKING APART THANK YOU SIR. SO

01:47:26.039 --> 01:47:27.207
BUT BUT I WOULD GUESS IT WAS

01:47:27.274 --> 01:47:28.108
THAT EVEN WHEN WE GOOD YEAR.

01:47:28.175 --> 01:47:28.909
THE THERE WAS NO IT TO AT IT

01:47:28.975 --> 01:47:30.143
THIS WAY IT'S IT THAT OFTEN

01:47:30.210 --> 01:47:33.046
JUST FEELS LIKE IT'S A- IT'S

01:47:33.113 --> 01:47:35.315
ALMOST A- OF THIS SOURCE OF

01:47:35.382 --> 01:47:37.384
REVENUE THAT THAT SEEMS TO BE.

01:47:37.450 --> 01:47:39.286
STE SPENT IN A WAY THAT'S YOU

01:47:39.352 --> 01:47:42.155
KNOW. YOU'VE CLEARLY HEARD THE

01:47:42.222 --> 01:47:43.490
REAL LEGISLATURE LEASE THIS

01:47:43.557 --> 01:47:45.292
COMMITTEE HAS STRONG DESIRE TO

01:47:45.358 --> 01:47:47.194
SEE HOW THIS IS SPENT AND

01:47:47.260 --> 01:47:49.796
ALLOCATED. YET EVEN IN THE GOOD

01:47:49.863 --> 01:47:52.299
YEARS. THAT YOU KNOW LOOKING AT

01:47:52.365 --> 01:47:54.034
THIS OVER A MULTI YEAR BASIS

01:47:54.100 --> 01:47:55.635
NEVER HAPPENED AND NOW WE CAN

01:47:55.702 --> 01:47:57.037
USE THE PROJECTIONS OF THE

01:47:57.103 --> 01:47:58.972
FUTURE AS A WAY TO FURTHER

01:47:59.039 --> 01:48:01.875
FORCED ALL THAT- I THINK THE

01:48:01.942 --> 01:48:03.577
BOTTOM LINE IS THAT THE

01:48:03.643 --> 01:48:05.478
PROVIDER BASE THAT THAT SERVES

01:48:05.545 --> 01:48:06.646
THESE NEEDY POCKET THIS NEEDY

01:48:06.713 --> 01:48:09.883
POPULATION. NEEDS STABILITY

01:48:09.950 --> 01:48:12.185
AND- AND PART OF THAT STABILITY

01:48:12.252 --> 01:48:14.454
LEADS TO BETTER QUALITY CARE

01:48:14.521 --> 01:48:16.423
MORE TIMELY CARE AND

01:48:16.489 --> 01:48:19.426
POTENTIALLY LESS COST TO THE

01:48:19.492 --> 01:48:21.428
STATE OF PEOPLE KING. DICTUM WE

01:48:21.494 --> 01:48:23.363
GET THE CARE THEY NEED FROM

01:48:23.430 --> 01:48:25.265
TRUSTED PROVIDERS WHEN THEY

01:48:25.332 --> 01:48:27.467
NEED IT SO SON CERTAINTY. IS

01:48:27.534 --> 01:48:29.202
NOT HELPFUL AND WHILE YOU MAY

01:48:29.269 --> 01:48:31.304
THINK AS THE DEPARTMENT THAT

01:48:31.371 --> 01:48:34.107
THIS IS YOU KNOW WILL SOUND WAY

01:48:34.174 --> 01:48:36.243
OF BUDGETING THINGS. FROM A

01:48:36.309 --> 01:48:38.278
HUMAN PERSPECTIVE IT'S REALLY

01:48:38.345 --> 01:48:41.314
NOT AND- AND I WOULD JUST

01:48:41.381 --> 01:48:44.184
IMPLORE. THE DEPARTMENT AT SOME

01:48:44.251 --> 01:48:46.920
POINT ON THIS ISSUE AND OTHERS

01:48:46.987 --> 01:48:48.321
TO NOT NECESSARILY LOOK AT

01:48:48.388 --> 01:48:50.357
THESE AS LINE ITEMS LOOK AT

01:48:50.423 --> 01:48:52.425
THEM AT THE HUMAN IMPACT AND

01:48:52.492 --> 01:48:54.261
THE PROPHETIC CARE IMPACT

01:48:54.327 --> 01:48:55.528
THAT'S HAPPENING FOR PEOPLE IN

01:48:55.595 --> 01:48:57.931
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND I

01:48:57.998 --> 01:48:59.199
KNOW THAT'S A BIG PARADIGM

01:48:59.266 --> 01:49:01.234
SHIFT BUT YOU KNOW WHEN WE LOOK

01:49:01.301 --> 01:49:03.103
AT OTHER THINGS OUT THERE YOU

01:49:03.169 --> 01:49:04.638
KNOW PREVENTION PROGRAMS AND

01:49:04.704 --> 01:49:06.473
THINGS LIKE THAT. THAT OFTEN

01:49:06.539 --> 01:49:10.410
GET PUSHED ASIDE- THIS IS JUST.

01:49:10.477 --> 01:49:14.114
THE UNCERTAINTY IS LEADING TO A

01:49:14.180 --> 01:49:16.082
POTENTIALLY UNCERTAINTY AMONG

01:49:16.149 --> 01:49:17.918
PROVIDERS AND POTENTIALLY POOR

01:49:17.984 --> 01:49:19.486
OUTCOMES WHICH IN THE LONG RUN

01:49:19.552 --> 01:49:21.121
ACROSS ACTUALLY BECAUSE THE

01:49:21.187 --> 01:49:23.857
STATE MORE MONEY. SO I'M JUST

01:49:23.924 --> 01:49:26.726
AT SOME POINT YEAH CAN WE

01:49:26.793 --> 01:49:27.894
CHANGE THE PARADIGM A LITTLE

01:49:27.961 --> 01:49:29.429

DEMONSTRATED- AND RESEARCHED-

01:51:06.059 --> 01:51:07.027
HOWEVER THERE IS LIMITED

EVIDENCE. IN CURRENT LITERATURE

01:51:09.129 --> 01:51:11.698
AROUND CGM'S FOR A BENEFITS FOR

01:51:11.765 --> 01:51:14.434
TYPE TWO DIABETES- ESPECIALLY

01:51:14.501 --> 01:51:16.703
LONG TERM I RESEARCH THAT HAS.

01:51:16.770 --> 01:51:18.338
SHOWN TO IT TO BE EFFECTIVE FOR

01:51:18.405 --> 01:51:19.939
TYPE TWO- FOR TYPE ONE

01:51:20.006 --> 01:51:22.108
DIABETES- OF THE PATIENTS TO

01:51:22.175 --> 01:51:24.244
USE INSULIN- AT THE BODY

01:51:25.779 --> 01:51:28.648
INSULIN. FOR TYPE TWO DIABETES-

01:51:28.715 --> 01:51:30.350
OCCURS WHEN BLOOD SUGAR LEVELS

01:51:30.417 --> 01:51:32.185
I BECOME ELEVATED AND DEVELOP

01:51:32.252 --> 01:51:33.820
INSULIN RESISTANCE AND CAN BE

01:51:33.887 --> 01:51:36.222
MANAGED WITH OTHER TREATMENTS-

01:51:36.289 --> 01:51:38.024
TREATMENT FOR TYPE TWO DIABETES

01:51:38.091 --> 01:51:39.125

HAVE TYPE TWO DIABETES AND NEED

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:48.301
INSULIN THERAPY IF THEIR BLOOD

01:51:48.368 --> 01:51:50.236
SUGAR TARGETS. AREN'T MET- WITH

LIFESTYLE CHANGES OR OTHER

01:51:52.439 --> 01:51:54.974
MEDICATIONS- I'M- AND A CGM

01:51:55.041 --> 01:51:57.577
WOULD BE AVAILABLE- TWO ADULTS

01:51:57.644 --> 01:51:59.145
WITH TYPE TWO DIABETES WHEN TED

01:51:59.212 --> 01:52:00.847
A TREATING PHYSICIAN DETERMINES

01:52:00.914 --> 01:52:01.881
THAT THAT WOULD BE MEDICALLY

01:52:01.948 --> 01:52:04.050
NECESSARY- AND- THE BEST

01:52:04.117 --> 01:52:05.852
TREATMENT FOR THAT INDIVIDUAL.

01:52:05.919 --> 01:52:07.587
HOWEVER THEY WOULD NEED TO

01:52:07.654 --> 01:52:09.589
SUBMIT A AN AUTHORIZATION

01:52:09.656 --> 01:52:11.024

YOU HAVE THAT COVERED- HOWEVER

01:52:13.259 --> 01:52:14.594
WOULD JUST NOTE AGAIN THAT MOST

01:52:14.661 --> 01:52:16.096
PEOPLE WHO USE AS CGM'S HAVE

01:52:16.162 --> 01:52:18.832
TYPE ONE DIABETES- A RESEARCH-

01:52:18.898 --> 01:52:21.067
IS VERY STRONG THERE. I'M IN

01:52:21.134 --> 01:52:22.268
WHICH IS WHY WE ARE DONNELLY

01:52:22.335 --> 01:52:23.436
PROPOSING TO COVER THERE BUT

01:52:23.503 --> 01:52:26.106
AGAIN TYPE TWO DIABETES CAN BE

01:52:26.172 --> 01:52:27.407
COVERED I'M WITH AN

01:52:27.474 --> 01:52:29.609
AUTHORIZATION- I WOULD ALSO

JUST I WANNA HIGHLIGHT IN

01:52:31.211 --> 01:52:32.479
REGARDS TO MEDICAL NECESSITY-

01:52:32.545 --> 01:52:34.614
QUESTION FOR TYPE ONE DIABETES.

01:52:34.681 --> 01:52:36.182

01:52:36.249 --> 01:52:38.218
ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE MEDICAL

THREE AND I'VE BEEN FIGHTING

02:55:10.833 --> 02:55:12.702
THEM EVER SINCE. THE CURRENT

02:55:12.768 --> 02:55:14.337

02:55:16.272 --> 02:55:17.440

02:55:18.941 --> 02:55:20.610

REASON RESIDENT DUMPING

02:55:38.494 --> 02:55:39.562

BY CALF. THEY HAVE THE ABILITY

02:55:54.076 --> 02:55:55.645
TO DISCHARGE RESIDENTS BUT THEY

02:55:55.711 --> 02:55:57.713
