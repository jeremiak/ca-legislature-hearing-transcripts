WHAT THIS PROCUREMENT WOULD DO

LOOKING AT BACK UP.

00:58:09.152 --> 00:58:10.854

01:00:21.651 --> 01:00:22.986
BUT THIS IS BEING SUPPORTED BY

01:00:23.052 --> 01:00:25.455

PATIENT SHOULD HAVE TO WORRY

01:46:02.189 --> 01:46:03.623
ABOUT IS HOW TO GET BETTER NOT

01:46:03.690 --> 01:46:05.025
WHETHER A HOSPITAL BILL COULD%

01:46:05.092 --> 01:46:08.261
LEAD TO FINANCIAL RUIN WITHOUT A

01:46:17.704 --> 01:46:20.674
GENERAL AROUND SURPRISE BILLING --

01:46:20.741 --> 01:46:21.842
FOR FOR ALMOST EVERYTHING

01:46:21.908 --> 01:46:24.277
RELATED TO MEDICAL CARE IN TWO

01:46:24.344 --> 01:46:25.445
THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN AND IT WAS

01:46:25.512 --> 01:46:27.180
A REALLY DIFFICULT REALLY

01:46:27.247 --> 01:46:28.648
DIFFICULT PROJECT.

01:46:28.715 --> 01:46:29.950
AND IT WASN'T PERFECT AND ONE OF

01:46:30.016 --> 01:46:31.184
THE THINGS WE DIDN'T ADDRESS WAS

01:46:31.251 --> 01:46:32.385
EMERGENCY ROOMS.

01:46:32.452 --> 01:46:34.354
AND IT'S CLEAR NOW THAT WE NEED

01:46:34.421 --> 01:46:35.522
TO ADDRESS THAT.

01:46:35.589 --> 01:46:37.424
I KNOW THAT NOBODY WANTS A

01:46:37.491 --> 01:46:39.392
SURPRISE BILL YOU GOT YOU YOU

01:46:39.459 --> 01:46:40.494

MIGHT BE OUT OF TOWN.

01:46:47.634 --> 01:46:49.102
IT'S SIMPLY NOT FAIR THAT IF

01:46:49.169 --> 01:46:50.637
YOU'RE NOT PART OF A NETWORK

01:46:50.704 --> 01:46:53.206

01:46:53.273 --> 01:46:53.807
EXORBITANT BILL AT THE END OF

01:46:53.874 --> 01:46:54.508
THE DAY.

01:46:54.574 --> 01:46:56.109
I UNDERSTAND THERE'S ANGST ABOUT

01:46:56.176 --> 01:46:57.210
THE SECOND PART OF THE BILL

01:46:57.277 --> 01:46:58.612
WHICH IS POTENTIALLY LOOKING AT

01:46:58.678 --> 01:47:00.413
SETTING RATES -- FOR SOME OF THE

01:47:00.480 --> 01:47:02.783
SERVICES AND I WOULD SAY THAT.

01:47:02.849 --> 01:47:04.184
WE NEED TO LET THIS BILL MOVE

01:47:04.251 --> 01:47:05.585
FORWARD AND WE NEED TO LOOK

01:47:05.652 --> 01:47:07.621
CONTINUE TO LOOK AT THAT PART OF

01:47:07.687 --> 01:47:09.256
THE BILL I THINK THAT THERE AYE

01:47:09.322 --> 01:47:10.657
THERE MAY BE VALID CONCERNS.

01:47:10.724 --> 01:47:12.058
THIS GIVES ALL HOSPITALS AN

01:47:12.125 --> 01:47:14.127

SO WE CAN ACTUALLY WORK WITH YOU

01:47:20.367 --> 01:47:22.502
ON A SOLUTION EVERY TIME WE TRY

01:47:22.569 --> 01:47:23.670
TO DO ANYTHING AROUND

01:47:23.737 --> 01:47:26.339
AFFORDABILITY OR TRYING TO LEVEL

01:47:26.406 --> 01:47:27.474
OUT COSTS.

01:47:27.541 --> 01:47:28.875
IT'S THE END OF THE WORLD FOR

01:47:28.942 --> 01:47:30.477
WHOEVER MIGHT BE AFFECTED.

01:47:30.544 --> 01:47:31.378
SO.

US AND BAD FOR HOSPITALS.

01:47:39.886 --> 01:47:41.655

I RECEIVED A BILL THAT WAS WELL

01:48:35.442 --> 01:48:37.043
BEYOND ANYTHING I EXPECTED THAT

01:48:37.110 --> 01:48:38.278
I COULDN'T AFFORD.

01:48:38.345 --> 01:48:40.513

02:15:58.583 --> 02:16:00.986
LIKE ABOUT THIS BILL IS THAT --

02:16:01.052 --> 02:16:02.254
IT ALLOWS LOCAL INVESTMENTS BY

02:16:02.320 --> 02:16:03.655
PUBLIC BANK THAT COULD INCLUDE

02:16:03.722 --> 02:16:05.090
AFFORDABLE HOUSING CLEAN ENERGY

02:16:05.156 --> 02:16:06.525
AND SMALL BUSINESSES.

02:16:06.591 --> 02:16:07.826
IT GIVES THE POWER BACK TO THE

02:16:07.893 --> 02:16:10.228
CONSUMERS THROUGH THIS PUBLIC

02:16:10.295 --> 02:16:14.833
BANK AND UNLIKE PRIVATE BANKS

02:16:14.900 --> 02:16:15.400
THAT PRIORITIZE SHAREHOLDER

02:16:15.467 --> 02:16:16.268
RETURNS.

02:16:16.334 --> 02:16:16.902
THESE PUBLIC BANKS COULD PROVIDE

02:16:16.968 --> 02:16:17.769
BENEFITS TO LOCAL COMMUNITIES IN

02:16:17.836 --> 02:16:19.104
THE RESIDENCE IN WHATEVER THOSE

02:16:19.170 --> 02:16:20.572
LOCAL COMMUNITIES ONE AND I

02:16:20.639 --> 02:16:21.773
THINK IT REALLY EMPOWERS THESE

02:16:21.840 --> 02:16:23.074
LOCAL COMMUNITIES.

02:16:23.141 --> 02:16:24.409

WANNA MAKE SURE THAT.

02:16:49.467 --> 02:16:52.370
THAT EVERYONE HERE UNDERSTANDS.

02:16:52.437 --> 02:16:56.808
IT -- THE THE POTENTIAL ROAD

02:16:56.875 --> 02:16:58.143
THAT WE'RE GOING DOWN HERE I I'M

02:16:58.209 --> 02:17:00.211
I'M READING FROM THE LOS ANGELES

02:17:00.278 --> 02:17:02.881
TIMES EDITORIAL -- THIS TALKING

02:17:02.948 --> 02:17:04.983
ABOUT HOW.

02:17:05.050 --> 02:17:06.718
THIS IS FROM MAY TWENTY SEVENTH

02:17:06.785 --> 02:17:07.953
JUST A FEW DAYS AGO.

02:17:08.019 --> 02:17:09.521
STATE LEGISLATURE CONSIDERS A

02:17:09.588 --> 02:17:10.855
BILL TO LET.

02:17:10.922 --> 02:17:13.091
EIGHT CITIES OPERATE BANKS STUDY

02:17:13.158 --> 02:17:14.926
SO IT'S A REALLY BAD IDEA.

02:17:14.993 --> 02:17:19.431
YOU KNOW I DISCORDANT FROM

02:17:19.497 --> 02:17:21.733
PASSAGES OF OF THE OP ED.

02:17:21.800 --> 02:17:22.934
FEASIBILITY STUDIES HAVE

02:17:23.001 --> 02:17:24.336
REPEATEDLY FOUND THAT A PUBLIC

02:17:24.402 --> 02:17:25.971
BANK WOULD BE TOO EXPENSIVE FOR

02:17:26.037 --> 02:17:27.339
GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND TOO

02:17:27.405 --> 02:17:29.274
RISKY FOR TAXPAYERS WHILE ALSO

02:17:29.341 --> 02:17:31.509
DELIVERING QUESTIONABLE VALUE

02:17:31.576 --> 02:17:34.546
VALUE TO THE COMMUNITY.

02:17:34.613 --> 02:17:36.314
COUNTLESS PUBLIC BANK PROPOSALS

02:17:36.381 --> 02:17:37.349
HAVE BEEN ABANDONED OVER THE

02:17:37.415 --> 02:17:39.217
YEARS BECAUSE BANKING IS REALLY

02:17:39.284 --> 02:17:40.919
EXPENSIVE COMPLICATED IN RISKY

02:17:40.986 --> 02:17:41.920
BUSINESS [inaudible]

02:17:41.987 --> 02:17:43.822
YOU KNOW.

02:17:43.888 --> 02:17:45.223
I I THINK MOST OF US ALREADY

02:17:45.290 --> 02:17:46.925
HAVE OUR MINDS MADE UP AS AS TO

02:17:46.992 --> 02:17:48.493
HOW WE WANT TO VOTE ON THIS BUT

02:17:48.560 --> 02:17:50.895
I JUST WANT TO SHARE.

02:17:50.962 --> 02:17:54.032
YOU KNOW TO CAUTIONARY TALES.

02:17:54.099 --> 02:17:55.500
IN A ONE I THINK IS IS IS

02:17:55.567 --> 02:17:56.701
PROBABLY BETTER KNOWN IN ORANGE

02:17:56.768 --> 02:17:59.371
COUNTY WHEN THEY WHEN THEY TRY.

02:17:59.437 --> 02:18:00.405
TO RAISE FUNDS WITHOUT RAISING

02:18:00.472 --> 02:18:03.141
TAXES THEY THEY STARTED ENGAGING

02:18:03.208 --> 02:18:05.577
AND AND BOND TRADING.

02:18:05.644 --> 02:18:07.512
AND THAT WILL LEAD TO THE ORANGE

02:18:07.579 --> 02:18:09.481
COUNTY GOING TO BANKRUPTCY.

02:18:09.547 --> 02:18:10.915
AND IN MY OWN DISTRICT IN THE

02:18:10.982 --> 02:18:12.584
CITY OF GARDENA.

02:18:12.651 --> 02:18:14.619
THEY THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A GREAT

02:18:14.686 --> 02:18:15.186
IDEA.

02:18:15.253 --> 02:18:17.622
TO FORM A MUNICIPAL INSURANCE.

02:18:17.689 --> 02:18:19.324
COMPANY.

02:18:19.391 --> 02:18:19.958
YOU KNOW THEY THOUGHT THAT THEY

02:18:20.025 --> 02:18:22.494
CAN -- YOU KNOW.

02:18:22.560 --> 02:18:24.029
CIRCUMVENT THE FOR PROFIT

02:18:24.095 --> 02:18:25.830
MOTIVES OF OF INSURANCE OF

02:18:25.897 --> 02:18:28.633
PRIVATE INSURANCE COMPANIES AND

02:18:28.700 --> 02:18:29.167
TO PROVIDE THEIR COMMUNITY

02:18:29.234 --> 02:18:29.934
SERVICE.

02:18:30.001 --> 02:18:31.636
WELL IT ENDED UP BEING A HUGE

02:18:31.703 --> 02:18:33.004
FINANCIAL DEBACLE.

02:18:33.071 --> 02:18:34.472
BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE

02:18:34.539 --> 02:18:35.874
EXPERTISE.

02:18:35.940 --> 02:18:36.975

BY MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE SOUTH

02:19:27.258 --> 02:19:31.129
BAY -- CONCEPTUALLY THIS.

02:19:31.196 --> 02:19:32.864
IS A REALLY GOOD IDEA BUT I

02:19:32.931 --> 02:19:34.099
THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT THAT

02:19:34.165 --> 02:19:36.568
WE CONSIDER -- THE REALITIES

02:19:36.634 --> 02:19:40.338
BEFORE US ACROSS -- THIS STATE --

02:19:40.405 --> 02:19:42.340
AND I HAVE A LOT OF CONCERNS

02:19:42.407 --> 02:19:44.175
ABOUT THIS BILL BECAUSE IT WILL

02:19:44.242 --> 02:19:46.711
FOLLOW FDIC REGULATIONS THAT

02:19:46.778 --> 02:19:48.780
MEANS THAT ALL OF THOSE IN THE

02:19:48.847 --> 02:19:50.515
CANNABIS MARKETS WILL STILL BE

02:19:50.582 --> 02:19:52.684
ON ABLE TO PARTICIPATE.

02:19:52.751 --> 02:19:54.853
IN THESE BANKS IF YOU HAVE A

02:19:54.919 --> 02:19:57.088
PUBLIC BANK DOES THAT MEAN THAT

02:19:57.155 --> 02:19:58.757
YOU ARE ALSO WILL IT HAVE CITY

02:19:58.823 --> 02:20:01.326
EMPLOYEES THAT ARE WORKING FOR

02:20:01.393 --> 02:20:03.962
IT OR WILL IT JUST BE -- WILL

02:20:04.028 --> 02:20:05.063
THOSE THAT ARE HIRED WILL BE

02:20:05.130 --> 02:20:07.665
EMPLOYEES JUST BE FROM THE CITY

02:20:07.732 --> 02:20:09.768
OR THERE'S JURISDICTION -- UNDER

02:20:09.834 --> 02:20:11.703
WHICH THE BANK IS FOUNDED SO ARE

02:20:11.770 --> 02:20:13.505
YOU INCREASING BUREAUCRACY OR

02:20:13.571 --> 02:20:15.974
NOT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT HELPING

02:20:16.040 --> 02:20:17.876
THE UNDER BANKED IN THE ON BANKS

02:20:17.942 --> 02:20:19.444
BE ABLE TO OPEN AN ACCOUNT.

02:20:19.511 --> 02:20:23.882
BUT THOSE -- POTENTIAL --

02:20:23.948 --> 02:20:26.184
CLIENTS OF A BANK STILL HAVE TO

02:20:26.251 --> 02:20:29.120
ABIDE BY THE CRITERIA SET BY

02:20:29.187 --> 02:20:31.656
FEDERAL LAWS SO HOW WILL THESE

02:20:31.723 --> 02:20:33.658
PUBLIC BANKS ENSURE THAT THOSE

02:20:33.725 --> 02:20:35.160
FOLKS WHO ARE UNBANKED AND UNDER

02:20:35.226 --> 02:20:38.329
BANKED GET CERTAIN KINDS OF

02:20:38.396 --> 02:20:40.532
ACCOMMODATIONS. TO ALLOW THEM TO

02:20:40.598 --> 02:20:42.834
BANK I WOULD BE REALLY CONCERNED

02:20:42.901 --> 02:20:44.536
IF WE DID THIS AND YOU LOOKED UP

02:20:44.602 --> 02:20:45.937
AND YOU SAW THAT THERE ARE ONLY

02:20:46.004 --> 02:20:47.305
CITY BANKS IN CERTAIN

02:20:47.372 --> 02:20:49.107
COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE.

02:20:49.174 --> 02:20:51.242
AND THOSE COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE

02:20:51.309 --> 02:20:52.811
IN SOUTH LA WHO PROBABLY

02:20:52.877 --> 02:20:54.045
DESPERATELY NEED A COMMUNITY

02:20:54.112 --> 02:20:57.816
BANK LIKE THIS WOULDN'T BE ABLE

02:20:57.882 --> 02:20:58.817
TO HAVE ONE OPEN.

02:20:58.883 --> 02:20:59.617
SO I THINK AS WE CONTINUE TO

02:20:59.684 --> 02:21:01.820
TALK ABOUT THESE ISSUES WE AND

02:21:01.886 --> 02:21:02.720
THEN ONCE AGAIN WHAT ABOUT THE

02:21:02.787 --> 02:21:04.355
BOARD OF DIRECTORS FOR BANKS HOW

02:21:04.422 --> 02:21:06.391
ARE THOSE FOLKS BEING SELECTED

02:21:06.457 --> 02:21:07.458
WILL THOSE BE POLITICAL

02:21:07.525 --> 02:21:09.260
SELECTIONS WILL THEY BE SELECTED

02:21:09.327 --> 02:21:11.729
BY THE CITY MANAGER -- OR THE

02:21:11.796 --> 02:21:14.265
MAYOR -- I THINK THESE ARE REAL

02:21:14.332 --> 02:21:16.000
ISSUES THAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE

02:21:16.067 --> 02:21:17.802
TO WORK OUT BEFORE WE GO DOWN

02:21:17.869 --> 02:21:19.771
THIS ROAD SO I WOULD JUST ASK

02:21:19.838 --> 02:21:20.972

02:21:21.039 --> 02:21:22.440

LOCALLY YOU'RE MORE LIKELY TO

02:26:32.116 --> 02:26:33.918
GET CAUGHT UP.

02:26:33.985 --> 02:26:36.087
AT THE SAME TIME THAT YOUR TAXES

JUST TAKING A RISK THAT'S TOO

02:26:44.095 --> 02:26:45.263

SIMPLY THAT WE HAD TO KEEP.

02:26:56.707 --> 02:26:58.409

AND LIKE ALL NEW IDEAS SOMETIMES

02:28:09.447 --> 02:28:10.348
ARE CHALLENGING.

02:28:10.414 --> 02:28:11.482
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT THE

HAVE HEARD FOR ME.

02:28:14.352 --> 02:28:16.354
A NUMBER OF TIMES THE BILL DOES

02:28:16.420 --> 02:28:17.989
NOT ESTABLISH BANKS

02:28:18.055 --> 02:28:19.557
AUTOMATICALLY.

02:28:19.624 --> 02:28:22.059
IT DOESN'T A PUTS A VERY

02:28:22.126 --> 02:28:23.961
RIGOROUS PROCESS.

02:28:24.028 --> 02:28:25.896
A RICH A VERY RIGOROUS PROCESS

02:28:25.963 --> 02:28:27.164

RATHER THAN MOTIVATED BY THE

02:28:46.851 --> 02:28:49.987
BOTTOM LINE.

02:29:21.952 --> 02:29:23.387
THE LAST.

02:29:23.454 --> 02:29:27.525
YOU HAVE TO BE FDIC INSURED.

02:29:27.591 --> 02:29:28.859
WE'RE NOT SAYING JUST GO PUT

02:29:28.926 --> 02:29:30.661
MONIES AT RISK YOU HAVE TO BE

02:29:30.728 --> 02:29:33.130
FDIC INSURED.

02:29:33.197 --> 02:29:34.999
AND SOMEONE MENTIONED -- THE LA

02:29:35.066 --> 02:29:36.233
TIMES ARTICLE.

02:29:36.300 --> 02:29:37.335
BUT WE APPRECIATE THE RIGOROUS

02:29:37.401 --> 02:29:38.903
DEBATE.

02:29:38.969 --> 02:29:40.137
WE DIDN'T HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO

02:29:40.204 --> 02:29:40.971
REAP BOTTLE BECAUSE WE WERE

02:29:41.038 --> 02:29:42.573
NEVER CONTACTED.

02:29:42.640 --> 02:29:44.041
LET'S BE VERY CLEAR THE REPORT

02:29:44.108 --> 02:29:45.443
THAT THEY POINT TO WAS ABOUT

02:29:45.509 --> 02:29:47.511
CANNABIS DOLLAR WAS NOT ABOUT

02:29:47.578 --> 02:29:48.112
THE TYPE OF DOLLARS THAT WE'RE

02:29:48.179 --> 02:29:50.181
TALKING ABOUT.

02:29:50.247 --> 02:29:51.916
AND AT THE VERY LEAST AT THE

02:29:51.982 --> 02:29:53.718
VERY LEAST I WOULD SAY.

02:29:53.784 --> 02:29:57.388
THAT I DON'T THINK REASONABLY.

02:29:57.455 --> 02:29:58.956
IT IT'S A IT'S A CHALLENGING

02:29:59.023 --> 02:30:00.324
IDEA TO THINK.

02:30:00.391 --> 02:30:02.059
THAT WE SHOULD PUSH BIG BANKS TO

02:30:02.126 --> 02:30:03.928
DO A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THAT

02:30:03.994 --> 02:30:05.629
WE SHOULDN'T THINK ABOUT DOING A

02:30:05.696 --> 02:30:06.697
NEW WAY OF BANKING BECAUSE THE

02:30:06.764 --> 02:30:07.865
OLD WAY OF BANKING ISN'T

02:30:07.932 --> 02:30:09.300
NECESSARILY WORKING FOR OUR

02:30:09.367 --> 02:30:10.434
COMMUNITIES.

02:30:10.501 --> 02:30:12.703
WE HAVE A HUGE PROBLEM WITH

02:30:12.770 --> 02:30:13.471
INCOME INEQUALITY HERE IN

02:30:13.537 --> 02:30:15.706
CALIFORNIA.

02:30:15.773 --> 02:30:18.142
WE HAVE GOT THE CHALLENGE.

02:30:18.209 --> 02:30:20.378
BILLIONAIRES AND WALL STREET TO

02:30:20.444 --> 02:30:20.911
DO SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT

02:30:20.978 --> 02:30:22.847
DIFFERENTLY.

02:30:22.913 --> 02:30:23.948
AND LOOK WE'VE GOT A LONG DEBATE

02:30:24.014 --> 02:30:25.416
IN THE SENATE.

02:30:25.483 --> 02:30:27.318
HOW MANY IDEAS HAVE WE PUSH

02:30:27.385 --> 02:30:28.486
THROUGH THIS THROUGH THIS

02:30:28.552 --> 02:30:30.421

IMPROVING.

02:30:36.460 --> 02:30:38.462
THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR PEOPLE.

02:30:38.529 --> 02:30:39.497
THIS LEGISLATIVE PROCESS WILL

02:30:39.563 --> 02:30:44.135
ALLOW US. TO ADDRESS CONCERNS.

02:30:44.201 --> 02:30:45.870
WILL ALLOW US TO ADDRESS THOSE

02:30:45.936 --> 02:30:48.572
COMMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE.

02:30:48.639 --> 02:30:50.674
AND GET TO A FINAL PRODUCT.

02:30:50.741 --> 02:30:51.776
THAT WILL IMPROVE THE LIVES OF

02:30:51.842 --> 02:30:53.177
CALIFORNIANS.

02:30:53.244 --> 02:30:54.512
THANK YOU VERY MUCH I

THE RIGOROUS DEBATE -- THIS IS A

02:31:09.026 --> 02:31:10.494
DEBATE THAT WE'VE BEEN HAVING

02:31:10.561 --> 02:31:11.662
ALL YEAR -- AND I WANT TO TAKE A

02:31:11.729 --> 02:31:13.164
MOMENT AND THANK THE BANKING

SUPPORTERS THIS BILL THROUGH THE

02:31:19.303 --> 02:31:21.105
PACES TO ADDRESS.

02:31:21.172 --> 02:31:22.907
THOSE QUESTIONS.

02:31:22.973 --> 02:31:23.574
I WOULD SUBMIT THAT WE HAVE DONE

02:31:23.641 --> 02:31:24.942
THAT AND LET ME JUST TAKE A FEW

02:31:25.009 --> 02:31:26.277
OF THE ISSUES THAT AND REYES

02:31:26.343 --> 02:31:27.845
FIRST OF ALL WITH REGARDS TO THE

02:31:27.912 --> 02:31:29.180
POSSIBILITY THE POLITICIZATION

02:31:29.246 --> 02:31:30.714
OF BANKS.

02:31:30.781 --> 02:31:32.416
UNLIKE PRIVATE BANKS.

02:31:32.483 --> 02:31:33.684
WHERE THERE IS NO IF I DO SURE

02:31:33.751 --> 02:31:35.586
DUE TO THE PUBLIC WE ESTABLISH

02:31:35.653 --> 02:31:36.720
THAT WITH THIS?

02:31:36.787 --> 02:31:37.488
THERE'D BEEN QUESTIONS AROUND

02:31:37.555 --> 02:31:39.089
THE IMPACT OF THIS BILL ON

02:31:39.156 --> 02:31:42.159
SMALLER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.

02:31:42.226 --> 02:31:43.561
THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS.

02:31:43.627 --> 02:31:44.895
SINCE I GRADUATED FROM SCHOOL

02:31:44.962 --> 02:31:47.598
SOME TWENTY PLUS YEARS AGO.

02:31:47.665 --> 02:31:48.966
THE LARGEST WALL STREET BANKS

02:31:49.033 --> 02:31:51.836
HAVE SWALLOWED UP 75% OF

02:31:51.902 --> 02:31:53.437
CALIFORNIANS LOCAL BANKS.

02:31:53.504 --> 02:31:54.905
AND THIS BILL.

02:31:54.972 --> 02:31:56.273
THIS BILL ENVISIONS A

02:31:56.340 --> 02:31:58.609
PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN ANY LOCAL

02:31:58.676 --> 02:31:59.944
PUBLIC BANK.

02:32:00.010 --> 02:32:01.779
AND CREDIT UNIONS AND LOCAL

02:32:01.846 --> 02:32:03.514
COMMUNITY BANKS JUST AS IS THE

02:32:03.581 --> 02:32:05.115
MODEL WITH THE BANK OF NORTH

02:32:05.182 --> 02:32:06.917
DAKOTA WHICH HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL

02:32:06.984 --> 02:32:07.485
THE FOR THE BETTER PART OF A

02:32:07.551 --> 02:32:09.019
CENTURY.

02:32:09.086 --> 02:32:10.554
I WE'VE CERTAINLY HEARD THE

02:32:10.621 --> 02:32:12.323
CONCERNS ABOUT THE FACT THAT

02:32:12.389 --> 02:32:13.157
THERE MAY BE SOME LOCAL

02:32:13.224 --> 02:32:14.391
GOVERNMENTS THAT EITHER DON'T

02:32:14.458 --> 02:32:15.993
HAVE THE WHERE WITH ALL TO

02:32:16.060 --> 02:32:17.661
FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THIS OR FOR

02:32:17.728 --> 02:32:18.229
HOME.

02:32:18.295 --> 02:32:20.431
THEY MAY NOT HAVE THE FINANCIAL

02:32:20.498 --> 02:32:21.999
LEADERSHIP TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS

02:32:22.066 --> 02:32:23.968
WE ARE AT THIS MOMENT DISCUSSING

02:32:24.034 --> 02:32:25.169
AMENDMENTS THAT WE WOULD ACCEPT

02:32:25.236 --> 02:32:26.770
IN THE SENATE TO ADDRESS.

02:32:26.837 --> 02:32:28.339
THOSE VERY CONCERNS.

02:32:28.405 --> 02:32:30.641
BUT LET ME JUST CLOSE BY SAYING

02:32:30.708 --> 02:32:32.443
WE NEED ANOTHER OPTION THAN WHAT

02:32:32.510 --> 02:32:34.078
WE HAVE RIGHT NOW I THINK

02:32:34.144 --> 02:32:35.279
EVERYONE KNOWS THAT AT THE

02:32:35.346 --> 02:32:37.181
MOMENT WE HAVE HUNDREDS OF

02:32:37.248 --> 02:32:38.649
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS.

02:32:38.716 --> 02:32:40.384
OF ASSETS BEING HELD BY OUR

02:32:40.451 --> 02:32:41.285
CITIES IN THE STATE OF

02:32:41.352 --> 02:32:42.720
CALIFORNIA THE ESTIMATE IS SEVEN

02:32:42.786 --> 02:32:43.888
HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS.

02:32:43.954 --> 02:32:45.389
THAT IS GOING TO THE LARGEST

02:32:45.456 --> 02:32:48.225
WALL STREET BANKS IN THE COUNTRY.

02:32:48.292 --> 02:32:49.727
AND THOSE BANKS ARE INVESTING

02:32:49.793 --> 02:32:51.128
PUBLIC MONIES.

02:32:51.195 --> 02:32:52.930
AGAINST OUR CALIFORNIA VALUES IN

02:32:52.997 --> 02:32:55.199
FOSSIL FUEL INDUSTRIES IN GUN

02:32:55.266 --> 02:32:56.667
MANUFACTURERS IN PRIZE PRIVATE

02:32:56.734 --> 02:32:58.736
PRISONS IN COMPANIES WITH UNFAIR

02:32:58.802 --> 02:33:00.304
LABOR PRACTICES.

02:33:00.371 --> 02:33:01.739
AND WE KNOW.

02:33:01.805 --> 02:33:03.474
THAT THESE LARGEST BANKS HAVE

02:33:03.541 --> 02:33:04.909
NOT BEEN ABLE TO ADDRESS THE

02:33:04.975 --> 02:33:06.777
NEEDS OF CONSUMERS WHO ARE

02:33:06.844 --> 02:33:08.145
EXPERIENCING PREDATORY LENDING

02:33:08.212 --> 02:33:09.780
WHO HAD MILLIONS OF FAKE BANK

02:33:09.847 --> 02:33:10.915
ACCOUNTS OPEN IN THEIR NAMES.

02:33:10.981 --> 02:33:12.249
WHO'VE LOST HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS

02:33:12.316 --> 02:33:13.717
OF DOLLARS OF INTEREST PAYMENTS

02:33:13.784 --> 02:33:15.252
AFTER THE GREAT RECESSION.

02:33:15.319 --> 02:33:17.454
WE ALL HAVE LITERALLY MILLIONS

02:33:17.521 --> 02:33:18.355
OF HOMEOWNERS WHO'VE BEEN

02:33:18.422 --> 02:33:19.690
VICTIMIZED BY THE MORTGAGE

02:33:19.757 --> 02:33:21.592

02:33:25.062 --> 02:33:25.829
CAPITAL.

02:33:25.896 --> 02:33:27.331
THIS IS A BILL TO SUGGEST

02:33:27.398 --> 02:33:29.600
ANOTHER PATH IT WOULD ALLOW FOR

02:33:29.667 --> 02:33:31.869
THE POSSIBILITY OF CHARTERING A

02:33:31.936 --> 02:33:34.672
LOCAL BANK BUT WE ALL KNOW WHAT

02:33:34.738 --> 02:33:35.773
THE CRITIQUE OF THIS BILL IS.

02:33:35.839 --> 02:33:37.041

IN THIS BILL.

02:33:40.611 --> 02:33:41.812
COULD LIKELY MAKE IT SO

02:33:41.879 --> 02:33:43.414
DIFFICULT THAT WOULD BE VERY

02:33:43.480 --> 02:33:44.481
DIFFICULT FOR ANY LOCAL

02:33:44.548 --> 02:33:46.083
JURISDICTION TO CREATE A LOCAL

02:33:46.150 --> 02:33:47.718
