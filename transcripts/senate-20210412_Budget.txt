AB EIGHTY FOUR IS A CONTINUATION OF BUDGET EARLY ACTIONS TO ASSIST CALIFORNIA'S ONGOING RESPONSE TO AND RECOVERY FROM COVERT NINETEEN- THE HOSPITALITY SECTOR WAS ONE OF THE SECTORS HARDEST HIT IN TERMS OF JOB LOSS BECAUSE MUCH OF IT HAD TO BE CLOSED ENTIRELY AS WE KNOW FOR EXAMPLE THE- MUSIC MEANT. PARKS CONVENTION CENTERS VARIOUS THINGS HAVE HAD TO BE CLOSED IN THEIR ENTIRETY SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC. CAUSING SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND JOBS TO BE LOST IN THAT SECTOR SINCE FEBRUARY TWENTY TWENTY THE HIGHEST OF ANY SECTOR WITHIN- WHICH AGAIN CALIFORNIA. AND SO THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE WITHIN THAT SECTOR NATIONWIDE IS TWICE THE NATIONAL. UNEMPLOYMENT RATE. WOMEN MAKE UP THE LARGEST PERCENTAGE OF THAT WORK FOR SO SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED THE REPORTS THAT INDICATE THAT MORE WOMEN EITHER WERE LAID OFF OR LEFT THE WORKPLACE DURING THIS PANDEMIC THAN MEN AND IN DECEMBER ALONE. WOMEN MADE UP ENTIRELY THE LAYOFFS FROM. SRO. FIVE ONE OF THE CONCERNS THAT MANY ECONOMISTS HAVE IS THAT WE HAVE 80% OF WOMEN WHO MAY NEVER RETURN TO THE WORK FORCE AND WE WATCH THE NUMBERS FROM THE RECESSION WE- THERE WERE MANY PEOPLE WHO LOST JOBS DURING THE RECESSION WHO'VE HAD A DIFFICULT TIME EVER RETURNING ESPECIALLY WITH OF SALT- FULL TIME WORK SINCE THAT TIME- GOVERNOR NEWSOM MADE HIS ANNOUNCEMENT TO FULLY REOPEN THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY ON JUNE FIFTEENTH YOU JUST MADE THAT RECENTLY. AND OF COURSE THE HOSPITALITY SECTOR IS INCLUDED IN THAT. NOW AB SEVENTY NINE THE BILL- THE BUDGET BILL JUNIOR ADDRESSES ANOTHER ONGOING STATE EMERGENCY IN THE WILDFIRE EARLY ACTION PLAN. AS WE KNOW WE'RE IN VERY SERIOUS DROUGHT CONDITIONS WE HAVE HAD EACH SUCCESSIVE YEAR HAS BEEN THE WORST WILDFIRE YEAR IN THE PAST. AND IN THE PAST FEW YEARS OVER SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION ADDITIONAL FUNDING HAS BEEN DEDICATED TO WILDFIRE SUPPRESSION- MEANING OUTSIDE GETTING NEW HELICOPTER STATED YOUR TOTAL TECHNOLOGY LARGE AIR TANKERS VARIOUS HIRING ADDITIONAL FIREFIGHTERS. AND WE'VE SPENT A GOOD AMOUNT OF MONEY ON SUPPRESSION BUT WHAT WE NEED TO INVEST IN IS OUR PREVENTION AND RESILIENCY EFFORTS. UNDER EACH DOLLAR INVESTED IN WILDFIRE PREVENTION WE SAVE SIXTY SEVEN DOLLARS IN DAMAGES- THIS THE WILDFIRE BILL IS HAS AN APPROPRIATION OF FIVE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX MILLION AND IT PROVIDES AN IMMEDIATE DOWN PAYMENT TO HELP THE CREASE THE SEVERITY OF WILDFIRES. WE WILL TAKE OUR PUBLIC COMMENT AFTER WE HEAR ALL THREE OF THE BILLS SO WE'LL HAVE THE PRESENTATION AND DISCUSSION ON EACH OF THE BILLS. OF COURSE EACH BILL WILL BE PRESENTED INDIVIDUALLY WE CAN DISCUSS THEM INDIVIDUALLY BUT THEN THE PUBLIC COMMENT WILL COME AT THE END ON ALL OF. SO LET ME SEE IF MY VICE CHAIRS HERE NOT SEEING HIM HERE- WE WILL BEGIN WITH THE PRESENTATION ON THE FIRST BILL WHICH IS AB SEVENTY NINE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- WE YOU CAN AB FOR BEGIN YOUR PRESENTATION ON AB SEVENTY NINE. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING A MAN ARMY DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THIS BUDGET BILL JUNIOR INCLUDES PROVISIONS FOR THE WILDFIRE PACKAGE AGREED UPON BY THE ADMINISTRATION IN THE LEGISLATURE. ENABLE IMPORTANT FIRE MITIGATION PROJECTS AMONG OTHER THINGS TO PICK CELEBRATED IN THE CURRENT YEAR. THIS PACKAGE COMES ON THE HEELS OF THE DEVASTATING TWENTY TWENTY FIRE SEASON. WHEN WILDFIRES BURNED OVER FOUR MILLION ACRES ACROSS THE STATE. MORE THAN A TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN FIRE SEASONS COMBINED AND SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THE MOST RECENT FIVE YEAR AVERAGE OF ACRES BURNED. CALIFORNIA NOW FACES A SIMILAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE FIRE SEASON. FROM JANUARY TO MARCH OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE CALIFORNIA HAS SEEN FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY FIRES RESULTING IN. EIGHTEEN HUNDRED ACRES BURNED. I FIGURE WAS FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE FIRESAND SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY SIX ACRES IN THE SAME TIME PERIOD. CALIFORNIA IS ALSO TRACKING DROUGHT CONDITIONS ACROSS THE STATE IN AS ADDED ADDITIONAL EMERGENCY FUNDING RESOURCES TO PREPARE. IT IS WHEN IT IS WITHIN THIS CONTEXT OF INCREASED AND MORE DANGEROUS WILDFIRES THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSED A ONE BILLION DOLLAR WILDFIRE AND FOREST RESILIENCE PACKAGE WITH THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE MILLION EARLY ACTION. CHIU EXCELLENT. AND FORCED HEALTH PROJECTS. AFTER COLLABORATION WITH THE LEGISLATURE THE EARLY ACTION PACKAGE BEFORE THE COMMITTEE TODAY. NOW INCLUDES FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX MILLION FOR A BROAD SET OF INVESTMENTS THAT SUPPORT A STATEWIDE STRATEGY FOCUSED ON FOREST HEALTH AND FIRE PREVENTION. THESE INVESTMENTS ARE CRITICAL TO CHANGING THE STATE'S APPROACH TO MANAGING WILDFIRE. STATE INVESTMENT SUPPORT THREE SIMULTANEOUS FRONTS OF WILDFIRE RESILIENCE. ITALIANS WITHIN% COMMUNITIES AROUND COMMUNITIES ACROSS LANDSCAPES. THERE ARE FOUR KEY INVESTMENT CATEGORIES. ONE CREATING RESILIENT WHILE LANCE THIS PACKAGE INCLUDESTWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THREE MILLION BOOKS ALREADY PROJECTS THAT WILL HELP CREATE MORE RESILIENT WHILE IN STATEWIDE MITIGATING CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES IN A CASCADING CLIMATE CONSEQUENCES LIKE DAMAGE TO WATERSHEDS MUDSLIDES AND LOSS OF HABITAT. OUR WILDFIRE FUEL BREAKS. PACKAGE INCLUDES ONE HUNDRED AND NINETY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS TO FIND STATE PROJECTS AND GRANTS TO LOCAL ENTITIES FOR EMERGENCY FUEL BREAKS TO PROTECTION UNITIES AND SENSITIVE AREAS AGAINST THE IMPACTS OF WILDFIRES. ISRAEL BREAKS ENABLE FIREFIGHTERS TO TAKE A STAND AGAINST A FIRE HE WAS DOUBLES CONTAINMENT LINES INTO SECURE EVACUATION ROUTES. THIRD WOULD BE COMMUNITY AND HOME GARDENING. ONE IN FOUR CALIFORNIANS LIVE IN A HIGH FIRE RISK STONE. DEFENSIBLE SPACE AND RETROFITS TO HARDEN HOME AGAINST EMBERS RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER CHANCE OF SURVIVAL IN THE WILD FIRE. INVESTMENTS WITHIN COMMUNITIES ARE ESSENTIAL TO PROTECT OUR RESIDENTS FROM ALL TYPES OF FIRES INCLUDING WIND DRIVEN FIRES THAT SPREAD EMBERS AHEAD OF THE FIRE FRONT. IT IS PACKAGE INCLUDES TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS THAT I INTENDED TO LEVERAGE AN ADDITIONAL SEVENTY FIVE MILLION OF FEDERAL FUNDS TO SUPPORT A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR PILOT PROJECT TO SUPPORT LOW INCOME AND DISADVANTAGED HOMEOWNERS NECESSITY IN ACCESSING RETROFIT STAR IN THEIR HOMES. FOURTH LAST WEEK IS CLIMATE RESILIENT ECONOMIC GROWTH THE EARLY ACTION PACKAGE INCLUDES INVESTMENTS TO ADDRESS WORKFORCE IN THE CLINTON SHORTAGES. WHICH HAVE HINDERED THE ACCELERATION EXHILARATING PACE AND SCALE WILDFIRE RESILIENCE. A THRIVING FORCED IN WOOD PRODUCTS MARKET IN CALIFORNIA WILL SUPPORT SUSTAINABLE FOREST MANAGEMENT. REGIONAL ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE. A THRIVING MARKET IS ALSO CENTRAL TO ASSURE THEIR OTHERWISE. ON COMMERCIAL MATERIAL IS NOT LEFT IN THE FOREST TO DECOMPOSE AND RELEASE CARBON WILL BE PILE BURNED. BY CREATING AN ECONOMIC USE OF THESE PRODUCTS THE STATE WILL GENERATE STRONG SUSTAIN PRIVATE INVESTMENT AND FORCED HEALTH. THE PACKAGE PROVIDES TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO HELP STIMULATE THE FOR SECTOR INVESTMENT IN ECONOMIC GROWTH. INCLUDING AN INITIAL SIXTEEN MILLION DOLLAR TRANSFER TO THE CLIMBING CATALYST FUND. COMMERCIAL BANKS TYPICALLY OFFER HIGH INTEREST LOANS IN THE FOREST SECTOR IN RURAL BANKS WHICH IS HISTORICALLY FUNDED THE SECTOR HAVE CLOSED. THE RESULT IS A SHORTAGE OF CAPITAL EQUIPMENT AND BUSINESS AVAILABLE TO HIGHER VEGETATION TIRE FOR VEGETATION THINNING OR FIRE RESILIENCE WORK. CREATING LOW INTEREST LOANS WILL REMOVE A MAJOR MARKET BARRIER AND EXPAND CRITICAL BUSINESSES IN THE SECTOR. IN ADDITION SIX MILLION DOLLARS ARE AVAILABLE FOR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT GRANTS TO HELP COMMUNITY COLLEGE PROGRAMS PROFESSIONAL CERTIFICATIONS AND TRAINING. IN ADDITION TO THESE WILDFIRE- ACTIONS THE BUDGET DEAL JUNIOR ALSO INCLUDES THREE POINT THREE MILLION GENERAL FUND FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE TO FIND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IN A MICRO GRANT PROGRAM FOR SMALL MID SIZED. IN CALIFORNIA IT ALLOWS THE DEPARTMENT OF COMMUNITY SERVICES AND DEVELOPMENT TO CARRY OVER UNSPENT CAP AND TRADE FUNDS IN THE AMOUNT OF SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FROM THE TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET ACT THIS IS CLARIFYING LANGUAGE NEEDED TO ACCESS THESE FUNDS.

THAT IS BY THE END OF MY PRESENTATION AND I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. LET ME SEE IF I'VE GOT MEMBERS WITH QUESTIONS. SEN EARLIER. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I HAD- ONE QUESTION AND I ASKED THIS QUESTION DURING THE BUDGET HEARING- IN JANUARY IN RELATION TO. ALTHOUGH OF FIRE ACTIONS HOW MUCH OF WHAT'S IN THIS PACKAGE WILL LOCALS BE ELIGIBLE FOR AND HOW MUCH IS JUST BEING DONE BY STATE AGENCY THE ANSWER THAT CAME FROM FINANCE A FEW WEEKS AFTER THAT INITIAL HEARING. WAS SIXTY LOCAL FORTY STATE AND I WONDERED IS THAT A PERCENTAGE THAT'S HOLDING IN THIS PACKAGE OR DID IT CHANGE DO YOU KNOW WHERE IT TOUGH OF FALLS. THANK YOU SENATOR- WE DID KIND OF A- OUR OUR INITIAL ASSESSMENT IS ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED SIXTY MILLION IS GOING TO BE GOING TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS BUT IF- IF WE MAY WOULD LIKE TO- DOUBLE CHECK- AND- GET BACK TO YOU BUT THAT'S KIND OF OUR- INITIAL. ANSWER THAT. SENATOR WHITE OAK GO AHEAD CENTER LAYERED. OOPS SORRY MAYBE A FOLLOW UP QUESTION BECAUSE I HAD A PERCENTAGE THE NEW AT A DOLLAR NUMBER IF IT'S FOREIGN SIXTY MILLION IS THAT EIGHTY TWENTY AS OPPOSED TO SIXTY FORTY WHERE'S THAT FALL PERCENTAGE WISE BETWEEN LOCALS AND STATE- I'M GONNA HAVE TO ASK. MY COLLEAGUE- REBEKAH MORE OR JUST MORE STE- I HELP HIM SIR AND IT- WE MAY NEED TO GET BACK TO YOU ON- MORE SPECIFICS ON THAT. THANK YOU SO MUCH I'M JUST GOT DEPUTY SECRETARY FOR FOREST HE CALIFORNIA NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY AND- THIS PROGRAM IS REALLY HEAVY ON A GREAT DOLLARS GETTING OUT TO COMMUNITY SO FOR EXAMPLE IN THE EARLY ACTION PACKAGE YOU CAN SEE HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN FORCE HEALTH GRANTS- JUST IN EARLY ACTION ALONE WILL BE ACCESSIBLE TO COMMUNITIES. V. TEN MILLION IN THE FOREST CALIFORNIA FORCED IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM FOR SMALL LANDOWNERS WILL BE AVAILABLE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL- THE URBAN FORESTRY PROGRAM WILL GO DOWN TO LOCAL AND COMMUNITIES V. MANY OF THE PROGRAMS THROUGH THE CONSERVANCY'S WE'LL GET OUT TO THE COMMUNITIES IN THEIR REGIONS. AND FUNDING FOR THE FIRE PREVENTION GRANTS A HUNDRED TWENTY THREE MILLION IT WILL ALSO GO OUT TO LOCAL COMMUNITIES- AND THEN GROUNDING ALL OF THAT IS THE REGIONAL PORTION FIRE CAPACITY PROGRAMS- WHICH IS FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS TO REALLY EXPAND THIS PROGRAM THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSERVATION THAT BUILDS COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENTS- AND- AND CAPACITY. TO ACTUALLY STEER A LOT OF THESE GRANTS INTO REGIONAL STRATEGIES BECAUSE SO MUCH OF OUR BDGET HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN FUNDED THROUGH GRANTS OUT TO COMMUNITIES WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT NEEDS ARE DONE IN A WAY THAT IS STRATEGIC AND HAS A CUMULATIVE IMPACT OF RESILIENCE ON THE LANDSCAPING AND FOR THOSE COMMUNITIES. SO THIS REGIONAL PORTION FIRE CAPACITY PROGRAM HAS BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL IN HELPING REGION'S DESIGNED- LANDSCAPE SCALE STRATEGIES BUILD UP LOCAL COLLABORATIVES THAT INCLUDE THE VOICES OF ALL LANDOWNERS AND THEN THE FUND THOSE PROGRAMS THROUGH THE VARIOUS GRANTS THAT I JUST LISTED- FROM STATE ENTITIES AND SO WHAT WE'RE SEEING NOW IS THIS FIFTY MILLION. WILL ALLOW. RIGHT TO EXPAND STATE AND TO NEW READ. SUCH AS OR COUNTY THE GREATER SACRAMENTO LIKE LOOK YELLOW. AND AND NOW PERSONAL MY REACH AND TO BE A TO DELIVER THOSE WILDFIRE RESILIENCE- ON THE GROUND AND DIRECT THE GRANT DOLLARS- THAT WE HAD IN SHE COMMUNITY COLLABORATIVES. DID THIS REALLY PUTS COMMUNITIES IN- YOU KNOW IN IN STEERING THEIR OWN WILDFIRE RESILIENCE BUT GIVING THEM EFFECTIVE TOOLS TO O IT IN A WAY THAT IS GOING TO BE STRATEGIC. IMPACTFUL AND LONG LASTING. MADAM CHAIR. YES GO AHEAD CENTER IT JUST A BRIEF FOLLOW UP AND THAT IS I'M SURE WHEN YOU SAID NAP AND CINNAMON THE OTHER COUNTIES YOU MEANT TO ADD SANTA CRUZ SO I'M GOING TO. I'M GOING TO TAKE THAT BUT THE OTHER THING IS AFTER THE HEARING WE GET US MAYBE WHAT YOU THINK YOUR BALLPARK IS A PERCENTAGE OF STATE AND LOCAL AND THEN WE'LL GO FROM THERE THANK YOU TOOK- ALL RIGHT I. HAVE I'VE SEE SOME OTHER FOLKS WITH THEIR- MIKE STEP SO MANY CALL AND SENATOR DOLLY SENATOR MEN AND THEN SENATOR NELSON SENATOR DOLLY. THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR I JUST WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON. THE LAST- SENATORS COMMENTS SO WE THIS IS EARLY ACTION. AND SO. IT'S URGENT WE ALSO WE OFF OBVIOUSLY KNOW THERE'S WERE SEEN DROUGHT WIND SO. I GUESS FOR. MAYBE A LITTLE MORE CLARIFICATION ON WE HAVE SHOVEL READY PROJECTS WE HAVE. FIRESTICK COUNCILS THIS YEAR ABOUT A CONSERVANCY HAS A BACKLOG IN MY DISTRICT OF PROJECTS THAT NEED FUNDING. SO WE WANNA GET THIS ON THE GROUND AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND MAKE AND TRY TO GET AHEAD OF THIS FIRE SEASON IS EXACTLY WHY WE'RE DOING THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION AND I AND I COMMEND THE ADMINISTRATION AND ALL OF THAT LEGISLATORS FOR DOING THIS. BUT WHO IS GOING TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR LIKE GETTING IT TO THE GROUND THAT'S THAT'S I THINK WHAT I THINK IS VERY KEY IN SO WHO WHICH WHICH AGENCY IS GONNA THEY GONNA JUST DIRECT THE MONEY OUT ANOTHER TWENTY MILLION IN THERE FOR ABOUT A CONSERVANCY BUT- HOW'S IT GONNA GO TO THE COUNTY SO THAT WE CAN WATCH THIS IN THE NEXT. YOU KNOW FEW WEEKS AFTER THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION GETS SIGNED AND WE CAN ACTUALLY SEE THOSE SHOVEL READY PROJECTS GET. STARTED THANK YOU SENATOR I'M GONNA TURN THAT QUESTION OVER TO JESSICA MORSE. THANK YOU SENATOR ABSOLUTELY THIS IS INCREDIBLY URGENT AND- EVERY WEEK WE CAN DO WORK OUT OF FIRE SEASON- MAKES THIS FIRE SEASON JUST A LITTLE BIT EASIER- AND WE'RE ALSO SOBRE ABOUT THE RESULTS WE CAN DELIVER ON BECAUSE FIRE SEASON IS UPON US NOW- SO IN HERE YOU HAVE. PROGRAMS THAT ARE GONNA BE DIRECTLY DONE BY THE STATE WE HAVE REQUESTED CONTRACTING RELIEF TO BE ABLE TO ACTUALLY GET PROGRAMS ON THE GROUND- WITHIN JUST A FEW WEEKS WHERE IS USUALLY A CONTRACTING PROCESS WOULD TAKE- MONTHS AT A TIME AND SO THIS ALLOWS US TO GO QUICKLY. SO CAL FIRE IS EXPANDING AND HAND CREWS AND FUEL CREWS SO YOU SEE THIS PROJECT START VERY QUICKLY DEPLOYING NATIONAL GUARD- CONSERVATION CORPS AND EXPANDING FUEL CREWS ON THE GROUND TO DO THESE STRATEGIC FUEL BREAKS IMMEDIATELY WILL ALSO BE SEEN THE CALVARY UNIT FIRE PROJECTS. EXPANDING THOSE ARE PART OF THE UNIT FIRE PLANTS AGAIN THOSE WILL BE ON THE GROUND VERY QUICKLY AND THE FUNDING FOR STATE PARKS DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL I LIFE AND DEPARTMENT OF CONSERVATION ALSO HAVE CONTRACTING RELIEF AND SO WE'LL BE ABLE TO GET THOSE DOLLARS- TO. THE GROUND SHOULD PROJECTS- WITH IN JUST A FEW WEEKS THE REST OF THE PROGRAM IS- IN GRANT DOLLARS AND WE ACTUALLY IN AN UNPRECEDENTED MOVE. GRANT SOLICITATIONS BEFORE WE HAD THE FUNDING IN HAND SO THAT WE COULD EXPEDITE THIS PROCESS AS YOU KNOW- IT BEAT THE GRANT. THAT MANY OF LOCAL COUNTIES AND COMMUNITIES RELY ON THOSE GRANTS TO BE EFFECTIVE AND SO WE'RE SEEING THOUGH IS. TO GET ON THE GROUND. LEE GRANT SOLICITATION ARE ALREADY OUT WHEN WE GET USED RESOURCE WILL BE ABLE TO STAY AWARD THOSE FOR- BUT YOU KNOW THAT WHILE. CRISIS JUST FIT ME IN THE BUDGET CRISIS THE BEST TIME TO BE ABLE TO GET WORK ON THE GROUND WHEN YOU TYPICALLY HAVE WHETHER WINDOWS. IS BETWEEN- JANUARY AND MAY AND SO WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT WINDOW WE'RE GOING TO START GETTING WORK ON THE GROUND NOW. BUT WE'RE HAVING AN UNPRECEDENTED DRY SEASON WE'VE- ALMOST DOUBLED THE ACREAGE BURNED. AS THIS YEAR AS WE HAD THIS TIME LAST YEAR SO WE ARE IN A VERY SERIOUS SITUATION AND THESE TOOLS WILL BE INCREDIBLY IMPACTFUL- ND SO HERE THE CALIFORNIA NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY. WE ARE WORKING WITH ALL OF THESE DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE GETTING THESE RESOURCES TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE DELIVERING. AN INCREDIBLY FAST PACE BUT WE HAVE TO BE REALISTIC THAT. THESE ARE MULTI GENERATIONAL CRISES CUT COLLIDING TO CREATE THE FIRE CRISIS WE HAVE FROM. CHANGE AND OF COURSE HOW. AND I SO YOU CAN'T RULE IT BACK JUST IN TWO. AND SO THIS IS. A FAST INVESTMENT US A HEAD START AND SHOULD BIAS RESULTS THAT WE CAN SEE THIS FIRE SEASON. AND CUMULATIVE RESULTS THAT WERE REALLY START SEEING THE IMPACT- BY NEXT FIRE SEASON. I THANK YOU FOR THE THOSE COMMENTS I APPRECIATE THAT- I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT WILL I KNOW THAT I REPRESENT LEVIN COUNTIES IT'S A HUGE AREA THAT HAS A LOT OF OUR CD'S. HAS PARTED CANCELS HAS THE CEREMONY CONSERVANCY- AND THEY'RE ALREADY READY TO GO I MEAN THEY JUST NEED FUNDING AND SO THAT WAS AND SO I HEARD A CCC I HEARD KALIFORNIA YOU KNOW IN IN THEIR PROCESSES AND THAT'S WHAT. ONE OF MY FRUSTRATIONS HAS BEEN THAT WE- IT MONEY IN THE PROGRAM AND WE CREATE NEW PROGRAMS WHEN THERE'S PROGRAMS THAT ARE UNDER FUNDED RIGHT NOW THAT ALREADY DO THE WORK AND THAT'S THAT'S WHAT I JUST WANNA BE ABLE TO TRACK IT BECAUSE I'M GONNA BE WATCHING THIS. OVER THE NEXT FEW WEEKS I AGREE WITH YOU WE ARE WAY BEHIND THE CURVE. THIS IS A DROP IN THE BUCKET BUT IT'S ACTUALLY WE'RE DOING SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY POSITIVE FOR CALIFORNIA AND- THE EARLIER WE GET ON THE GROUND. THE BETTER TO WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO IT IN BEFORE WE GET INTO FIRE SEASON WHERE IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO DO THESE PROJECTS WHEN IT'S HOT DROUGHT TO BECAUSE ACTUALLY DOING THE PROJECT CAN. CAN CREATE FIRE. SO I APPRECIATE THAT I'LL BE WATCHING AS WE GO THROUGH AND- MAKING SURE THAT WILL HOPEFULLY WE GET TO THE AGENCIES THAT ARE ALREADY READY TO DO IT. THE R. C. D. SIX FIRE SAFE COUNCILS THE CONSERVANCY'S. SO WE CAN GET ON THE GROUND. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR DOLLY LET ME GO TO SENATOR MEN NOW. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I APPRECIATE THE EMPHASIS ON HARDENING AND PREVENTION AND I'M AS A SOMEONE WHO REPRESENTS ORANGE COUNTY I'M I'M GRATEFUL YOU MENTION MY AREA AND AS WE'VE SUFFERED- HI TWO RECENT FIRES WITH BOND AND SILVERADO WITHIN ONE MONTH OF EACH OTHER- I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO EMPHASIZE THE LOCALIZED NATURE FIRE RISKS- BUT I WANTED TO. ASK YOU ABOUT- MY BUDGET REQUESTS FOR A LITTLE WHILE FIRE- AD PHASE TWO EXPANSION I UNDERSTAND THE ALERT WILDFIRE PHASE ONE WAS SEEN AS TREMENDOUS SUCCESS SUCCESSFUL- THE INSTALLATION OF HUNDREDS OF CAMERAS IN. FIRE PRONE AREAS ACROSS THE STATE HAS PROVIDED FIRST RESPONDERS WITH- YOU KNOW EARLY NOTICE OF WHEN FIRES ARE OCCURRING- AND THAT'S I THINK SAVED A LOT OF LIVES SAVED A LOT OF PROPERTY- BUT FACE TO AS I UNDERSTAND IT WOULD WOULD PROVIDE DIGITAL MAPS. THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO BETTER UNDERSTAND WHERE THERE ARE FIRE RISKS WHERE FIRES MIGHT HEAD- WHERE WE MIGHT FOCUS OUR FUEL REDUCTION EFFORTS AND ALSO ALLOWING FIRST RESPONDERS TO TRY TO. FIGURE OUT WHERE TO DEPLOY THEIR RESOURCES WHEN FIRES ARE RAGING ALL OF THIS I UNDERSTAND WILL SAVE LIVES AND- THE COST OF THIS PROGRAM AT TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS- I REALIZE EVERY BUDGET LINE ITEM IS DEALING WITH SCARCE RESOURCES BUT THIS SEEMS LIKE- SOMETHING THAT IS A NO BRAINER JUST BECAUSE OF THE POTENTIAL IT HAS FOR ALLOWING US TO MITIGATE. FIRE SO- I GUESS MY QUESTION IS IT WOULD YOU CONSIDER THAT IN IN AS WE GO FORWARD I HOPE THIS COMMITTEE DOES CONSIDER INCORPORATING THAT PROGRAM AND. FUNDING IT IS IT'S PART OF OUR DISCUSSIONS- THANK YOU SENATOR I GUESS WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THAT THE SCOPE OF THIS EARLY ACTION PACKAGE BEFORE YOU IT IS TO. IS REALLY FOCUSED ON THE FIRE. BUT IN GETTING THESE PROJECTS STARTED AS AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. THERE IS OBVIOUSLY ARE A NORMAL BUDGET CYCLE- NAY NO BUDGET CYCLE- WHERE- WE HAVE THE MAIN REVISION PROCESS THAT WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF- A DEVELOPING IN THERE WILL BE FURTHER CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE TWENTY TWENTY. ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET. AND THAT THERE WILL BE. OPPORTUNITIES FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION ON ADDITIONAL ITEMS AT THAT TIME. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU MANAGER. THANK YOU SENATOR MEN SENATOR NIELSEN. BUT DO YOU HAVE A CLARIFICATION OF FINANCE IF I MAY. IN THE MY- COLLEAGUE FROM THE COAST AND FROM BEAVER- WE'RE ASKING ABOUT THE DIRECTED MONIES TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT I WANT TO BE IS IT SPECIFICALLY CORRECT THAT THESE MONIES WOULD BE DIRECTED TO IN PART. FIRE SAFE COUNCILS AND RESURS RESURS RESOURCE CONSERVATION DISTRICT WILL THEY BE ACCESSIBLE TO THOSE ENTITIES. I'D LIKE TO TURN THE QUESTION OVER JUST COMMERCE. THE QUESTION SENATOR YES V. V. PROGRAM- THE REGIONAL FORTUNE FIRE CAPACITY PROGRAM AT THE RESOURCE CONSERVATION AT THE END DEPARTMENT OF CONSERVATION PARTNERS DIRECTLY WITH COUNTIES AND RESOURCE CONSERVATION DISTRICTS AND SO ONE OF THE MAIN TOOLS WE HAVE FOR GETTING THEM RESOURCES IS ENSURING THAT WE'RE GIVING THEM THE CAPACITY IN THE TOOLS TO SUCCEED. AND THEN OUR GRANT DOLLARS FROM THE FOREST HEALTH PROGRAMS FIRE PREVENTION GRANT THEN HERE IN DIRECTLY TO THOSE RESOURCE CONSERVATION DISTRICT AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO APPLY FOR THE GRANTS BUT WHAT WE'RE DOING IS ENSURING THAT THEY ARE GETTING THE TOOLS TO SUCCEED- AND SO B. THE PROGRAM PART OF THE INNOVATION HERE IS THAT. WE ARE EXPANDING THE EXISTING OUR- REGIONAL FORCING FIRE CAPACITY PROGRAM WHICH DOES INCLUDE SANTA CRUZ ALREADY AND- EXPANDING IT YOU KNOW COVER STATEWIDE SO WITH THAT BEING RESOURCE CONSERVATION DISTRICT AND LOCAL COUNTIES HAVE DIRECT PATHS TO GET FUNDING- IN ADDITION TO THE- THAT HELP SUPPORT AND EXPEDITE OUR GRANT DOLLARS- AND THIS ALSO GETS DOLLY WAS RAISING ABOUT SHOVEL READY PROJECTS THE MAJORITY OF THE FUNDS IN HERE ARE DIRECTED EXACTLY TOWARD SHOVEL READY PROJECTS. THAT THAT IS OUR CLEAR CRITERIA THAT YOU'RE NEVADA CONSERVANCY HAS A HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION SHOVEL OVERA HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE SHOVEL READY PROJECTS WHICH IS WHY THEY ARE GETTING- DIRECT FUNDING AND SO I JUST WANT TO BE REALLY CLEAR THAT FOR THE EARLY ACTION DOLLARS IT IS GOING TOWARDS SHOVEL READY PROJECTS AND I'M JUST TRYING TO EMPHASIZE THAT WE HAVE PROVIDED TOOLS TO ALSO THEN. SUPPORT REGIONS IN ACCESSING THOSE DOLLARS. MORE EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY. THE ANSWERS QUESTION IN REGARD THE R. C. D.'S BUT ABOUT THE- FIRE COUNCIL. WHAT THEY CALL AND LOCAL. THE FIRE TO ALL OF THESE GRANTS AVAILABLE TO ANY ENTITY THE FIRE SAFE COUNCILS ARE OFTEN RECIPIENT OF THE FIRE PREVENTION- GRANT FUNDING OF WHICH THERE'S A HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE MILLION I BELIEVE I'M IN THIS IN THIS BUDGET PROPOSAL- FOR. FIRE PREVENTION GRANTS SO THEY ARE PART OF THE TEAM ON THIS EFFORT AND- AND ARE WE ARE GIVING THEM SUPPORT TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS THESE DOLLARS QUICKLY AND EFFICIENTLY LET ME FOLLOW UP AGAIN AND- MY FIEND FROM BEAVERS QUESTION TO- DO YOU HAVE A TRACKING SYSTEM. IN PLACE. AS THE MONEY THAT IS A LOT OF THIS YEAR WILL THERE BE TRACKING TO SEE HOW THIS WENT. WHAT THE SUCCESSES BANNED. ANY ASSESSMENT OF THE SUCCESS OF THE MONIES. DEALT OUT TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. CERTAINLY ON THE AND WE ALREADY HAVE TRACKING SYSTEMS FOR THESE LARGE GRANT PROGRAMS SUCH AS THE HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE MILLION IN FIRE PREVENTION GRANTS THAT HELP US A REPORT OUT ON WHAT THE DO YOU AND- AND HOW THEY ARE DELIVERED THE REGIONAL ALL OF THESE ENTITIES ALREADY HAVE. MECHANISMS THAT TRACK AND THEN WILL BE- TRACKING IT INTERNALLY AS A WHOLE PROGRAM AS WELL TO DELIVER THE RESULTS BUT IT'LL IT'LL LIKELY BE LOOKING AT. WHEN YOU'RE REALLY LOOKING AT HOW DO YOU MEASURE SUCCESS WILL BE ABLE TO MEASURE THE WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE AND- THE ACTIVITIES WE'VE ACHIEVED AND WHERE THEY ARE- BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S REALLY CRITICAL SUCH AS WE LEARN THE LESSON WITH LIKE THE THIRTY FIVE EMERGENCY FUEL. SAVE LIVES FOR EXAMPLE WE WENT DOWN TO THE CREEK FIRE WHERE WE HAD FIVE EMERGENCY FUEL BREAKSTHAT HAVE BEEN PUT IN WITH THE NATIONAL GUARD. IN TWENTY NINETEEN IN RECORD TIME AND THEY SAVE LIVES AND HOMES AND CREATIVE STATION ACTIVATION ROUTES DURING THE CREEK FIRE WHICH IS ONE OF THE MOST DYNAMIC AND- DEVASTATING FIRES WE HAD IN STATE HISTORY. AND SO THESE RESILIENT% ACTIVITIES- WE'RE GONNA BE TRACKING OUR WORK AND OUR PROGRESS BUT- WE'LL SEE ADDS FIRE RESILIENCE MOVES FORWARD HOW WE'RE ACTUALLY- LESSENING PROPERTY DAMAGE. I'M KEEPING CALIFORNIA SAFE AND ENSURING THAT OUR ECOLOGIES ARE HEALTHY AND FIRES RETURNING BACK TO ITS NORMAL ECOLOGICAL NORMS AS OPPOSED TO THESE CATASTROPHIC FIRES WERE EXPERIENCING. AND HELL WOULD LEGISLATE TORS OR INDIVIDUAL CITIZENS ACCESS THAT DATA THAT INFORMATION THAT TRACKING. INFORMATION HOW WOULD WE- THAT WE HAVE- LET'S JUST REPORTS THAT COME OUT. ALL OUR FIRE PREVENTION AND- FOREST HEALTH GRANT PROGRAMS AND SO WE'RE HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE. OUR LEGISLATIVE REPORTS- ALONG WITH THESE PROGRAMS THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR NELSON RECEIVED THERE'S ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FOR MEMBERS- PROMISE EVEN. BURKE SAID BOB SENATOR AKOWSKI NO YOU DO NOT HAVE YOUR MAKEUP SO NO OTHER FOLKS WITH MY- ALL RIGHT. WE WILL SEEING NO OTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE WE WILL GO TO IF YOU RECALL I AND NOW IT'S DOES WE OPEN THIS HEARING THAT WE WILL TAKE OUR PUBLIC COMMENT. AT THE END OF HAVING THE PRESENTATION AND DISCUSSION ON ALL THREE BILLS SO WE WILL NOW MOVE. TO THE- NEXT- BILL. WHICH IS- PLEASE NEVER GET TO GO BACK TO MY LITTLE SCRIPT- AB EIGHTY FOUR. SOUTH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE CAN YOU- BEGIN THE PRESENTATION ON AB EIGHTY FOUR. YES THANK YOU SENATOR- SO THE COMPANY NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS HAD A DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT ON LOW INCOME EMPLOYEES THIS BILL ATTEMPTS TO ADDRESS THE NEGATIVE ECONOMIC IMPACT ON EMPLOYEES IN THE HOSPITALITY AND BUILDING SERVICES INDUSTRIES WERE LAID OFF DUE TO THE PANDEMIC. THIS BILL PROVIDES A STATEWIDE UNIFORM POLICY FOR THE RECALL OF LAID OFF EMPLOYEES BY THEIR EMPLOYERS AND IT TENDS TO PROVIDE THOSE WORKERS WITH AN OPPORTUNITY TO REGAIN EMPLOYMENT SPECIFICALLY THIS BILL REQUIRES SPECIFIED HOSPITALITY EMPLOYERS TO OFFER ANY NEWLY ESTABLISHED POSITIONS TO QUALIFIED FORMER EMPLOYEES LAID OFF FOR COLLUDED NINETEEN RELATED REASONS WITHIN FIVE BUSINESS DAYS OF ESTABLISHING THE POSITION. THROUGH DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. I WAS ABLE IN PLEASE ARE THOSE WHO WORK FOR THE EMPLOYER FOR SIX MONTHS OR MORE DURING THE TWENTY NINETEEN CALENDAR YEAR IN WERE LAID OFF DUE TO A PUBLIC HEALTH DIRECTIVE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN ORDER. LACK OF BUSINESS OR ANOTHER. ECONOMIC NON DISCIPLINARY REASON BECAUSE BY THE COBIT NINETEEN PANDEMIC. BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO THIS OBLIGATION OUR HOTELS AND PRIVATE CLUBS WITH FIFTY OR MORE ROOMS. LARGE EVENTS CENTERS WORDS REPORTER HOSPITALITY AND SERVICE PROVIDERS AND BUSINESSES THAT PROVIDE DRAINAGE. FINANCE OR SECURITY SERVICES TO COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS. THIS REQUIREMENT APPLIES TO THE SPECIFIED HOSPITALITY AND BUSINESS SERVICES EMPLOYERS EVEN IF THE EMPLOYER OR ALL OF THE ASSETS OF THE EMPLOYER AFTER HE HAVE CHANGED OWNERSHIP SINCE LAYING OFF THE EMPLOYEE PROVIDED THEY'RE STILL CONDUCTING THE SAME OR SIMILAR BUSINESSES. THIS BILL ALSO APPROPRIATES SIX MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE LABOR COMMISSIONER TO FORCE THIS BILL. THANK YOU AND HAPPY AND. ANSWER QUESTIONS OKAY- LET'S SEE IF THERE ARE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS% FROM MEMBERS CENTER NIELSEN. THE MANAGER OF THIS AND I'M OBJECTING JUST FOR THE RECORD THIS IS A MAJOR POLICY BILL BEING. PUT IN THE GUYS AND I USE THAT WORD VERY EXPLICITLY GUYS. OF A BUDGET BILL THE TRAILER BILL I DON'T THINK IT IS A TRAILER BILL I THINK IT IS A POLICY BILL IT SHOULD GO TO COLLEGE- COMMITTEE THERE ARE MAJOR POLICY. DECISIONS HERE. IN THIS LEGISLATION. AND PLEASE DO ALSO AFFECT BUSINESS AND IN A MAJOR WAY. THERE ARE PROVISIONS IN HERE OF THE RETRO ACTIVE. THE POSITIONS REGARDING WHO COULD COME BACK TO WORK AND UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES. AND IT DOES I THINK AT LEAST DISCOUNT OF NOT OBVIATE CONSIDERING MARRIAGE AND THE RECALL. OF WORKERS. A LOT OF PROVISIONS IN HERE I THINK. DO WARRANT THE IN DEPTH SCRUTINY AND OUR HEARING HERE TODAY CERTAINLY IS NOT SUFFICIENT FOR THAT PURPOSE. AND NORA COMMITTEE WHEN WE VOTE NOR IN THE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE. STILL I'M OBJECTING AND I THINK THAT THERE ARE SOME PROVISIONS IN HERE THAT I THINK- OUGHT NOT BE. YOU SEE IF THERE'S THE OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS SENATOR LAYERED. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR BUT THOUGHT I BOUGHT HAD SOME ANGST ABOUT. THIS BILL JUST ON THE BASIS THAT I AM NOT. CERTAIN THAT PEOPLE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL ARE FULLY AWARE OF. THE FACT THAT THIS IS MOVING- PARTICULARLY SINCE I KNOW AND- IT AND NOW ONE OF MY DISTRICT COUNTIES MONTEREY THERE'S A BIG DEBATE- ABOUT THIS GOING ON AND I HAVEN'T HEARD FROM ANYONE IN MONTEREY COUNTY AND SO THAT GAVE ME CONCERNED. I THINK OUR OUR I ALSO MET A DISADVANTAGE IN THAT THIS WAS THOROUGHLY DEBATED- BEFORE I WAS HERE. IN THE SENATE. AND THE GOVERNOR VETOED IT BUT HE LAID OUT THINGS IN THIS BILL CLEARLY ADDRESSES EACH OF THOSE AFTER THAT THOROUGH DEBATE WHETHER IT IS. A SUNSET THAT DIDN'T EXIST WHETHER IT'S REALLY TIED COVERED WHICH WAS DIFFERENT THAN WHETHER IT REMOVES THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION SO WHILE I WISH THIS WAS MOVING IN A WAY. THAT I COULD HEAR FROM LOCALS AND THEY WERE FULLY AWARE OF IT- I THINK THAT THAT GIVES ME ENOUGH OF A COMFORT LEVEL TO MOVE IT ALONG. FIVE SENATOR DOLLY I GOT YOU BUT LET ME HAVE SENATOR DRAWS SO FIRST THAT WAS THE NEXT DAY AND I SAW IT UP. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- I JUST WANT TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE- ISSUES BEFORE US THIS WAS A BILL THAT WAS FULLY DEBATED THOROUGHLY DEBATED. LAST YEAR WHEN WE WERE IN THE WORST PART I THINK OF OUR OF OUR PANDEMIC OF CONCERN ESPECIALLY FOR WOMEN WORKERS. THIS INDUSTRY HAS A OF- SIGNIFICANT IF NOT MAJORITY WOMEN WORKERS WE KNOW TO STUDY AFTER STUDY AFTER STUDY THAT WOMEN WORKERS ESPECIALLY AS THEY GET A LITTLE BIT OLDER ARE THE MOST DISCRIMINATED AGAINST WHEN IT COMES TO. THREE ARE GETTING THEIR JOBS BACK- AND THIS HAS BEEN SHOWN NATIONALLY AS WELL AS IN CALIFORNIA. IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR THE WOMEN IN THIS INDUSTRY TO BE ABLE TO GO BACK TO THE JOB THAT THEY HELD THAT IT NOTHING MORE NOTHING LESS JUST GET THEIR JOBS BACK SO THIS WAS FULLY DEBATED LAST YEAR IT WENT ALL THE WAY. TO THE GOVERNOR'S DESK AND THE GOVERNOR RAISED SEVERAL ISSUES OF CONCERN TO HIM IN THE VETO MESSAGE ALL OF THOSE ISSUES HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED IN THIS BILL ALL OF THOSE ISSUES FROM- THE LINK THERE IS A SUNSET IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR LAST YEAR THERE WAS NO. LAWS SUNSET. SOME OF THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION WELL THERE WERE SEVERAL OTHER OF THE SCOPE THAT IT HAD TO BE RELATED TO. A PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY LIKE COVERT NINETEEN. OF THEIR WORDS NO- IT WAS NOT THAT NARAL LAST YEAR IS VERY NARROW THIS YEAR. AND REALLY GOES TO THE HEART OF THE ISSUE IS. WORKING PEOPLE IN THE VERY VERY CRITICAL INDUSTRY TO CALIFORNIA. THOSE MEN AND WOMEN ESPECIALLY WOMEN- NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN LOST THEIR JOBS BECAUSE OF THIS PANDEMIC. ALL IT'S SAYING IS LET'S ALLOW THEM TO GO BACK TO THEIR JOBS LET'S JUST MAKE SURE THEY GET BACK TO WORK. NOW THE TIMING IS SO IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE ARE OPENING UP OPENING UP WILL FULLY OPEN UP IN A MATTER OF MAYBE A COUPLE OF MONTHS. AND THOSE PEOPLE THOSE WORKERS THOSE WORKING FAMILIES SHOULD BE ABLE TO COUNT ON THEIR THEIR JOBS SO THE URGENCY IS NOW TO GET THEM ALLOW THEM TO GET BACK TO WORK- AND I REALLY BELIEVE THE- THE NARROW SCOPE. IS THAT THE KEY ELEMENT HERE AND THAT WE FULLY DEBATED THIS LAST YEAR SO I REALLY URGE. EVERYONE TOOK TO LOOK AT THAT AND SUPPORT THIS OF FOR THE TIMELINESS FOR THE FOR THE FACT THAT WE FULLY DEBATED THE FACT THAT IT'S IMPACTING SO MANY WOMEN WHO JUST WANT TO GET BACK TO WORK. THANK YOU MENTION. THANK YOU SENATOR ALI FOLLOWED BY SENATOR CAFIERO. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS I WANTED TO SHARE- A LITTLE BIT EXPERIENCE AS A BUSINESS OWNER ON JUST UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES THAT HAPPENED DURING COVERT SO NUMBER ONE FIRST WE DID A STATE HOME ORDER EVERYBODY WENT HOME. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ALONG WITH THE STATE GOVERNMENT ALLOWED. THERE ARE POLICE TO YEAH WE GET TO UNEMPLOYMENT ONE OF THE HUGE PROBLEMS WITH UNEMPLOYMENT APARTMENT WE'VE ALL DEALT WITH THAT NOT GONNA GO THERE BUT IS THAT THEY DIDN'T ASK THE EMPLOYERS. WHEN THE EMPLOYEES WERE LAID OFF BECAUSE EVERYBODY WAS LAID OFF FOR A SHORT PERIOD FOR SURE AND IN THIS THEY WERE SENT TO WORKERS- BUT WHAT HAPPENED WAS THAT FEDERAL GOVERNMENT GAVE SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A WEEK AND THEN. AND THEN THE MAXIMUM I THINK FOR UNEMPLOYMENT CALIFORNIA'S. MAYBE FOUR HUNDRED A LITTLE MORE. SO SOME OF THESE EMPLOYEES ARE ACTUALLY MAKING MORE MONEY BY NOT WORKING. BECAUSE OF THE FEDERAL INFUSION OF RESOURCES. TO CAUSE A PROBLEM FOR THOSE BUSINESSES THAT WE'RE TRYING TO HIRE THE BACKS OF MANY. BUSINESSES WHICH I KNOW PERSONALLY- FOR THEIR EMPLOYEES WOULDN'T COME BACK TO WORK BECAUSE THERE WAS NO ABILITY FOR THE E. D. TO ACTUALLY DIDN'T SAY STOP QUANTIFYING. TO THE TO THE EMPLOYERS IF THEY WERE. REALLY UNEMPLOYED BECAUSE IF YOU OFFER THEM BACK THEIR JOB. AND THEY DON'T AND THEY DON'T RETURN TO THEIR JOB. THEN YOU ARE NOT REQUIRED TO PAID EMPLOYMENT BUT THE EMPLOYMENT DEPARTMENT DIDN'T. FILL IN THAT LOOP SO A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT WERE WORKING WERE WHY WOULD THEY GO BACK TO WORK WHEN THEY'RE MAKING MORE MONEY BY NOT WORKING BECAUSE OF THE- RESOURCES THAT WERE PUT IN. TO NOW THIS BILL WE COME WE FAST FORWARD TO THIS TIME. WE'RE NOT GOING TO IT WE'RE GOING TO PENALIZE SOME OF THOSE EMPLOYERS. BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO HIRE IN A DIFFERENT I WOULD TELL YOU IF I OFFERED A JOB BACK TO MY EMPLOYEE WHO DIDN'T COME BACK BECAUSE THEY WERE MAKING MORE MONEY BECAUSE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AND THE STATE WAS PUT. PASSING OUT MONEY AND WASN'T VERIFYING. THE REASON FOR THEM TO LOSE THEIR JOB. I WOULD NOT WANT TO HIRE THEM FIRST BECAUSE THEY HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO COME BACK TO WORK. AND THEY DIDN'T COME BACK TO WORK SO MY POINT IS THAT IT'S UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES BUT IS NOT DEALT WITH. IN THIS SCENARIO ED BUT IT PENALIZES. THE BUSINESS OWNERS AND MANY OF THESE ARE SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS THAT ARE VERY STRUGGLING RIGHT NOW. TRANSMITIDO USES ISSUE IT'S NOT BEEN TALKED ABOUT BUT IT'S A FACT. IN ITS IN ITS REALLY DIFFICULT AS A BUSINESS OWNER THEY HAVE THE LEGISLATURE PUSH DOWN THESE RULES. WHEN YOU'RE BASICALLY TELLING US HOW TO RUN OUR BUSINESS WHEN THERE'S- WE HAVE WE COULDN'T GET THEM TO COME BACK TO WORK IN THE FIRST PLACE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR CAREER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS BUT I WANT TO START OUT BY SAYING- I SUPPORT OF THE BILL LAST YEAR AND I'M GONNA SUPPORT THE BILL THIS YEAR BUT THE KEY IS THAT THAT IS MAKING SURE YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT'S IN THE BILL. IT'S BEEN SAID TO ME THAT- PAGA HAS BEEN- TAKEN OUT OF AND I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE- AT SO THE FIRST QUESTION I HAVE IS- AND THAT THERE IS NO PAGA- PRESCRIPTION IN THE BILL NUMBER ONE- NUMBER TWO CAN AN EMPLOYEE BROUGHT BRING A PRIVATE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION THAT'S NUMBER TWO AND I'M ASSUMING IF THE ANSWER IS NO THERE'S NO PAGA IT NO THERE'S NO PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION THAT IT'S A LABOR COMMISSIONER THAT'S ENFORCING THIS AND SO I WANNA MAKE SURE OF THAT- AND THEN AND THEN. LASTLY I I'D LIKE TO- THAT CONFIRM THAT THIS OVERRIDES LOCAL ORDINANCES- I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE WE'RE ALL WE ALL UNDERSTAND THAT THAT'S WHAT IT WHAT IT'S DOING I BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT THE BILL SAYS I JUST WANT A CONFIRMATION OF THAT ADAM CHAIR AND THEN I JUST THINK THE WHOLE PURPOSE FOR THIS OBVIOUSLY IS THAT- I NOW THAT WHERE WE CAN MOVE AROUND A LITTLE BIT I'VE BEEN ABLE TO TRAVEL AND COMING BACK AND FORTH FROM HOME TO SACRAMENTO. THERE ARE HELP WANTED SIGNS EVERYWHERE AND- I THINK WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS WE WANT TO GET PEOPLE BACK TO WORK AS QUICKLY. AS POSSIBLE. NOT BE SLAPPING- BUSINESSES. MAY INADVERTENTLY. MESS UP AND SO THAT THAT'S MY ONLY CONCERN IS THAT- THIS IS KIND OF PRESCRIPTIVE LIKE I SAID I'VE SUPPORTED IT IN THE PAST BECAUSE I REALLY DO THINK THAT EMPLOYEES ARE TO BE HIRED BACK BY THEIR EMPLOYERS- IF THEY WERE DOING A GOOD ENOUGH JOB BACK BEFORE THE PANDEMIC THEY THEY NEED TO BE RE HIRED AGAIN- BUT IF I COULD GET THOSE THOSE QUESTIONS ANSWERED I APPRECIATE THANK HURTLING. FAR IN FINANCE CAN YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR- I'M GONNA ASK ROBERT- THE LOBOS- TO HELP ANSWER THAT QUESTION THANK YOU. HERE ON MUTE. YOU NEED TO ON ME YOURSELF DANCER. OKAY CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW YES. OKAY YES ROBERT THE LOCALS FROM THE LABOR COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE AND- YOU KNOW THE ANSWER TO BOTH QUESTIONS I THINK IS NOT ADDRESSED IN THE IN THE LANGUAGE AND IN THE SECTION ITSELF AND IT CONFERS EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION- UPON THE LABOR COMMISSIONER. AND THAT THE SECTION CAN ONLY BE ENFORCED. BY A COMPLAINT THAT'S FILED BY. EIGHTY LAID OFF EMPLOYEE A WITH THE LABOR COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE SO I GOT THAT DONE VERY- EXPRESSING AND DEFINITE- LANGUAGE. SPEAKS TO BOTH THE- THE LACK OF A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION IN THE IN A FLEXIBILITY TO. THANK YOU. SENATOR MAN JUST TO BE SURE THAT- THE BILL- IT. IS MANDATORY IN TERMS OF THE ENTIRE STATE AND SUPERSEDES LOCAL ORDINANCES. YES IT DID IT WAS  DOCTOR LOCAL ORDINANCES- BUT WOULD STILL BE ALLOWED TO EXIST HOWEVER THEY COULD NOT AFFORD ANY PROTECTION THAT WOULD BE LESS THAN WHAT IS PROVIDED UNDER STATE LAW SO THERE IS THEIR DINNER. THEY WILL CONTINUE TO EXIST ABOUT WHAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO BE ENFORCED IN A MANNER WHICH WOULD BE DONE WITH THE- FUNDAMENTAL REQUIREMENT SUPPOSED LACK OF THE STATE. LANGUAGE C. PROVISIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. LET ME SEE VERY SEE ANY OTHER. MIKE SAID- THE COMMON I WANTED TO ADD IS THAT- HI. I THINK IT IS CERTAINLY THE INTERESTING THING WAS WE'VE NOTED MORRIS- DESCRIBED IS THAT THIS IS A SECTOR THAT HAD VERY HUGE JOB LOSS WHICH OF COURSE IT WOULD HAVE BECAUSE IT CLOSED- AND INTERESTINGLY IT IS ALSO RIGHT NOW THE SECTOR THAT IS OPENING. MOST QUICKLY. AND SO THERE THAT IS A THAT GIVES US THAN A RATIONALE FOR WHY WE WOULD WANT TO ACT NOW TO HELP INSURE THAT THOSE EMPLOYEES WHO AS ONE OF OUR COLLEAGUE STATED NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN LOSS OF JOB. NOW HOWEVER. SOME OF THOSE EMPLOYEES MAY CHOOSE NOT TO GO BACK RIGHT NOW AND THAT IS THEIR CHOICE NOW FOR SOME OF THEM IT MAY NOT BE IN EFFECT WHAT I WANT TO CALL A. THERE'S CHOICE AND THEIR CHOICE BUT I THINK WE- YES IT ON UNDER EMPLOYMENT WITH THE ADDITIONAL BENEFITS THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PROVIDED SOME LOADS LOW WAGE WORKERS WERE COMPENSATED DID HIGHER HOWEVER. THE CHOICE TO GO BACK TO WORK OR NOT LET'S TAKE FOR EXAMPLESOME OF THE WOMEN IN THE SECTOR. IS ALSO. DEPENDING ON WHETHER THEY HAVE CHILDREN AT HOME. AND WHETHER THERE'S CHILD CARE FOR THEIR CHILDREN AND WE KNOW THAT THE PANDEMIC ALSO CLOSED MOSTRO CARE FACILITIES OR WHETHER SCHOOLS ARE OPEN. AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT WE'RE JUST BEGINNING TO GET OUR SCHOOLS BACK OPEN. SO WE COULD FACE A SITUATION WHERE SOME WOMEN WHEN THEIR EMPLOYER OFFERS IT BACK TO HIM OR NOT IN A POSITION TO BE ABLE TO EXERCISE THE CHOICE. TO TAKE THE JOB ACT WHICH I THINK WOULD BE VERY UNFORTUNATE. BUT THERE IS NOT ANY THEN. RESPONSIBILITY ON EMPLOYERS IF THE PERSON IS OFFERED THE JOB AND THEY CHOOSE NOT TO THE EMPLOYER CAN PROCEED WITH HIRING SOMEONE ELSE. NOW I WOULD HOPE THAT IN THAT WE CAN THESE THINGS CAN ALL KIND OF A LINE IN THE TRIAL CARE BEGINS TO GET OPEN AGAIN ALSO. AND I THINK WE'VE A- WE AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAVE BEEN ACTING TO PROVIDE SOME MORE FUNDING. IN ORDER TO HELP ENSURE THAT CHILD CARE SAVING TO GET CHILD CARE BACK OPEN WE KNOW THAT WE'VE ACTED TO HELP OUR SCHOOLS GET BACK OPEN. SO HOPEFULLY THESE THINGS A LINE. SO THAT FOR EXAMPLE AND WOMEN ARE NOT THE ONLY PEOPLE THAT HAVE AG CHILD. CARE RESPONSIBILITIES AT HOME BUT CERTAIN PRIMARILY. HOPEFULLY THESE THINGS A LINE SO THAT WHEN PEOPLE ARE OFFERED THEIR JOBS BACK THEY CAN TAKE THEM. AND THE IMPORTANCE OF THAT OF COURSE IS THAT. THEY WOULD BE OFFERED THEIR JOBS BACK AND GET THE SAME TYPE OF WAGE. THAT THEY RECEIVED. PRIOR WHEN THEY LAID OFF. INTERESTINGLY DURING THE GREAT RECESSION. OLDER WORKERS NOW WE'RE TALKING AGES FORTY FIVE AND ABOVE. WERE LAID OFF AT A HIGHER RATE. LOWER WAGE WORKERS NOT AS NOT EXECUTIVE BUT LOWER WAGE WERE LAID OFF AT A HIGHER RATE THAN YOUNGER. AND ON AVERAGE PICKED UP TO A YEAR TO GET ANOTHER JOB. COMPARED TO WORKERS WHO WERE FORTY AND YOUNGER WHO ON THE AVERAGE TOOK NINETEEN TO TWENTY WEEKS. THE ADDITIONAL FACTOR IS THAT THOSE OLDER WORKERS DURING THE RECESSION WHO WERE LAID OFF. AND IT TOOK ON AVERAGE A YEAR TO GET ANOTHER JOB THERE SAID NEXT JOB AFTER THAT LONG PERIOD OF UNEMPLOYMENT WAS AT A FAR LOWER WAGE THAN THEIR PREVIOUS JOB NOT SO WITH THE YOUNGER WORKERS. SO WHEN YOU IMAGINE I THINK ANY OF US AS WE GET. CLOSER TOWARDS RETIREMENT. WE ARE HOPING THAT WE ARE NOT GOING BACKWARDS IN TERMS OF OUR- INCOME OR CONTRIBUTIONS TO SOCIAL SECURITY SINCE THAT IS WHAT'S GOING TO BE OUR RETIREMENT SECURITY. SO I THINK THIS WHEN WE LOOK AT. WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE GREAT RECESSION AND IF WE WANT TO TRY TO PREVENT SIMILAR CONSEQUENCES AS TO NOW AND WHEN WE ALSO LOOK AT THE MANY OF THE WOMEN IN THIS CATEGORY OF WORK. FIVE NOT IN ALL CASES BY ANY MEANS BUT A LOT OF THEM ARE THE SOLE HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD AND HAVE DEPENDENT CHILDREN. SO THEY'RE- EITHER IF THEY DO NOT GET BACK INTO WORK WHERE THEY ARE PAID COMPARABLE TO WHAT THEY WERE BEFORE. AND ALSO HAVE GREAT IMPACTS ON THEIR CHILDREN SO. FOR THOSE REASONS I WILL BE SUPPORTING. THIS LEGISLATION AND I APPRECIATE THAT IT IS BEEN NARROWED AND HAS A SUNSET AND ALSO WOULD ONLY GOING TO AFFECT. INSIDE IN RELATION TO THE SERIOUS EMERGENCIES LIKE THIS PANDEMIC. MILANESI SAID A CENTER RECORDS COULD YOU HAVE YOUR MAKE UP. NO OKAY I THOUGHT I SAW MIKE UP. AS SENATOR- CHAU BOOK. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK I JUST HAVE A QUICK QUESTION- RIGHT. IS THERE A REASON WHY- THIS BILL DOES NOT PROVIDE A RIGHT TO Q. WERE FOR EMPLOYERS PRIOR TO GOING STRAIGHT TO PENALTIES OF UP TO SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS. PER EMPLOYEE PER DAY AND ENFORCED BY THE LABOR COMMISSIONER- I UNDERSTAND THAT HALF OF THE LOCAL ORDERS ON THIS PARTICULAR TOPIC ALLOW FOR A FIFTEEN DAY RIGHT TO CURE- THAT WOULD AT LEAST BE A REASONABLE STEPS TO BEGIN WITH. THE BERMAN OF FINANCE WOULD YOU LIKE TO ADDRESS THAT. YES LET ME TURN IT OVER TO- ROBERT VILLA LOBOS- WELL WE PRETTY MUCH YOU TO REVIEW THE JOB THE BILL. IN A LANGUAGE AS YOU KNOW WELL AS IT IS AND- ONE OF THE THINGS WE DID NOTICE THAT THERE WERE LOCAL ORDINANCES THAT WOULD PROVIDE FOR THE- RIGHT TO KEEP YOUR- THE ONE ASPECT OF IT I THINK THAT PRESENTS PROBLEMS IS THAT IT IMPOSES A REQUIREMENT. ON WORKERS TO YOU KNOW TO COMPLY TO INITIATE- YOU KNOW HE THEIR OPPORTUNITY TO BE REHIRED. AND THAT YOU KNOW CAN BE PERCEIVED AS A AS A SOMEONE. ONEROUS REQUIREMENT FOR LOW WAGE WORKERS AND GOD SAW THAT THE YOU KNOW THE ABSENCE OF THAT LANGUAGE YOU KNOW IN THIS BILL YOU KNOW SEEM TO. BE MORE APPROPRIATE- THAT IS THAT IS A SENSE THAT- YOU KNOW OUR OFFICE SADDAM HAD WITH RESPECT TO THE ABSENCE OF A RIGHT TO CURE PROVISION. SENDER TERRIBLE YOU HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION I WOULD YES MADAM CHAIR FRED- SO WOULD IT BE. WOULD IT BE BEST- PERHAPS PURSUED FROM AN EMPLOYER'S PERSPECTIVE TO. C. OR REQUEST A MEANS OF- HAVING A- THE ABILITY TO HAVE THE RIGHT TO CURE AB A REQUEST I FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE STATING THAT YOUR CONCERN WAS FROM THE EMPLOYEES- PROVOCATIVE BEING THAT I HAVE A AN EXTRA STEP TO TAKE WOULD IT BE BEST IF IT WAS- STARTED FROM THE EMPLOYERS. SPECTATOR INGLE. I WOULD. WELL I MEAN WE REALLY WORK LOOKING AFTER YOU KNOW THE SPECIFIC PROBLEM YOU KNOW POLICY- WELL YOU KNOW PROS AND CONS IN TERMS OF WHAT COULD BE UTILIZED TO YOU KNOW TO. ADD TO THE EXISTING PROVISIONS OR THE CURRENT PROVISION OF THE BILL- IT IS SO WHICH IS IT WE WERE LOOKING AT IN TERMS OF JUST WHAT. YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT EXISTS AND- YOU KNOW SAW THAT THERE WAS SOME IT WAS A REASONABLE POSITION TO HAVE- OR WERE TO NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO CURE PROVISION IN THE BILL- SO ARE YOU HI. I JUST UNABLE TO REALLY ANSWER WHETHER- THAT COULD BE VIEWED AS YOU KNOW BY OTHERS- INCLUDING THE LEGISLATIVE BODY AS AS BEING THAT THE POLICY- TATE YOU KNOW FOR. THAT ISSUE. IF I COULD TO SAID QUICKLY ED MR LOS DOESN T. ISN'T MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE PROCESS FOR THE LABOR COMMISSIONER IS A QUICK RESOLUTION TO COMPLAINTS AND GIVEN THAT THIS IS A SHORT DURATION IS THAT WHAT MIGHT THAT HAVE BEEN CERTAINLY SHE COULD SPEAK TO THAT PROCESS BECAUSE NEEDED YES YES YES WITH THAT THAT'S CERTAINLY- YOU NO LONGER WOULD FACTOR IN AND UNDER THE AFORESAID PROVISIONS- YOU KNOW AGENTS IN TERMS OF OUR FEEL GOOD FOR SPENT WHERE. WE WOULD BE LOOKING TO ENFORCE THE- PERHAPS THIS PENALTY OR LIQUID DAMAGES. R. ONCE OUR OFFICE RECEIVES A COMPLAINT. THERE THERE'S EARLY INTERVENTION- WE WOULD BE CONTACTING THE EMPLOYER YOU KNOW WE- WOULD ALSO IS PART OF OUR TOOLS OF FROM. THE PRECEDING WE CAN ISSUE A NOTICE TO DISCONTINUE OUR PRIOR TO. ACTUALLY DETERMINING WHETHER K&lt;c.cyan&gt; A&lt;/c&gt; CIVIL PENALTY AND LIQUIDATED DAMAGES IS THE APPROPRIATE REMEDY- IN THE CONTEXT OF THE FILING OF A CLAIM FOR INDIVIDUAL RELIEF SUCH AS THE REINSTATEMENT OF THE FRONT AND THE BACK HEY YOU KNOW THE- THE VALUE OF THE BENEFITS. BUT AGAIN YOU KNOW. ONCE THE COMPLAINT COMES TO US NO THERE WOULD BE A NOTIFICATION TO THE EMPLOYER- THAT THERE WAS AN INVESTIGATION YOU KNOW. AND HOMES SOLD YOU KNOW IN BOTH CASES THERE'S A REASONABLY. QUICK OPPORTUNITY FOR THE EMPLOYER TO. YOU KNOW TO- HIGHS YOU KNOW IT ITS LIABILITY WITH RESPECT TO THE INDIVIDUAL RELIEF. FOR A VOID PERHAPS YOU KNOW THE- CIVIL PENALTY LIQUIDATED DAMAGES BY BEING INFORMED THAT- THAT THEY NEED TO COMPLY. MR LEWIS'S GIVEN THAT SENATOR OCHO BOOKS QUESTION WAS ABOUT THE RIGHT TO CURE AND PLEASE CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG BUT MY THINK MY UNDERSTANDING IS ISN'T THE RIGHT PICTURE ASSOCIATED WITH PROGRESS. IN THE- THE RIGHT OF THE EMPLOYEE TO SUE AND ISN'T THE ELIMINATION OF PAGA MEANING THE FACT THAT THIS BILL THIS ELIMINATES THAT YOU DO NOT HAVE THAT RIGHT DOES THE EMPLOYEE DOES NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE. THAT THAT IS A FACTOR IN WHETHER YOU NEED WHETHER THE RIGHT THE- TIME IS NECESSARY. WELL CERTAINLY THERE ARE PROVISIONS IN PART ABOUT WHICH- YOU KNOW WHICH ARE CURABLE. BEHIND SO AND I NOTICE WOULD HAVE TO GO YOU KNOW WELL BE MADE TO THE EMPLOYER- AND THAT. SHOULD MAYBE THAT ONE OF THE UNDERLYING. PRINCIPLES OR CONCEPTS THAT- LOCAL ORDINANCES WERE LOOKING AT- PRIOR TO IMPOSING LIABILITY- SO YOU YES I THINK THE ABSENCE OF. ANY OBJECT ABILITY TO PAGO- YOU KNOW- IS IT SOMEWHAT TELLING- AND SO. I WOULD SAY THAT THAT'S YOU KNOW THAT CERTAINLY WOULD. BE A FACTOR- SENATOR JOE BERGIN CAN HAVE THE FLOOR AGAIN I JUST I WAS TRYING TO SINCE YOU ASKED ABOUT THE RIGHT TO CURE I THOUGHT. PERHAPS HE HAD NOT THOUGHT ABOUT THAT ASPECT BUT- I WASN'T SURE IF MY INFORMATION WAS CORRECT OR NOT BUT POLICE YOU HAVE THE FLOOR IF THERE'S ANY OTHER FURTHER QUESTIONS. MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU FOR YOUR ASSISTANCE ACTION APPRECIATE AS A FRESHMAN SENATOR HERE FOR SHE AND FEEDBACK AND SUPPORT FROM ANY OF MY COLLEAGUES. IN CONVEYING MY QUESTIONS AND MY IDEAS SO THANK YOU- SO IJUST WANT TO JUST FOR CLARIFICATION PURPOSES WANT TO MAKE SURE I ABSOLUTELY AGREE. I UNDERSTAND. THIS W STILL HAVE WITHIN THIS BILL THE OPPORTUNITY FOR BUSINESSES TO. HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY WITH THE ABILITY TO- BASICALLY. MEET WHATEVER THE REQUIREMENT FOR THE- WOULD YOU SAY THE CLAIM WOULD BE BEFORE ANY PUNITIVE- MEASURES ARE IMPLEMENTED OUR PURSUIT. DO YOU THINK WOULD IN SO FAR AS AS I AS I PREVIOUSLY- EXPRESS IT WOULD BE YOU KNOW HOW THE PARTY NOTIFICATION TO THE EMPLOYER- OF A COLORFUL VIOLATION OR POTENTIAL VIOLATION THAT WE WOULD BE INVESTIGATING. AND HOW TO THAT EXTENT THAT MAY FOR CLOTHES OR- WORSE CERTAINLY TO BE CONSIDERED IN EVALUATING WHETHER THE LABOR COMMISSIONER WOULD PROCEED TO COLLECT THIS CIVIL PENALTY A LIQUIDATED DAMAGES- WITH RESPECT TO THE- INDIVIDUAL RECOVERY ON THE REINSTATEMENT- AS WELL AS THE BACK PAY YOU KNOW THAT. WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT- THEY WOULD CERTAINLY BE A TO. ANY SORT OF- ACTUAL DAMAGES THAT LABOR COMMISSIONER MIKE RECEIVE AGAINST THE EMPLOYER. BUT YOU KNOW WE'RE HOPEFUL THAT. THE NOTIFICATION CAN MINIMIZE THIS AND IN THAT WE REALLY ARE ARE TRYING TO MOVE TOWARDS THE UNDERLYING INTENT OF THE BILL WHICH IS TO. IT'LL FORD. PLAYED OFF WORKERS THE OPPORTUNITY. TO YOU KNOW NEEDS TO BE REAPPLIED INCOMPLETE. WITH HER FORMER EMPLOYER. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR WELCOME SENATOR NIELSEN. NOPE MANAGER I'M GOING TO RE VISIT THE POLICY ISSUE OF. A COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES TALKED AT LENGTH HEALTH THOROUGHLY THIS WAS DEBATED LAST YEAR. AND THAT WOULD BEEN AS A POLICY BILL I'D LIKE TO ASK THEN FINANCE WHY IS THE ADMINISTRATION ADVANCING THIS NOW AS A TRAILER BILL RATHER THAN AS A POLICY BILL. I'M GONNA HAVE TO TURN THAT OVER TO YOU- CHRIS COOK. GOOD MORNING CHRIS COOK WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- CENTER NIELSEN TO YOUR QUESTION AND AS PREVIOUSLY STATED- SB EIGHTY FOUR IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE BILL THE LEGISLATURE PASSED LAST YEAR AB THIRTY TWO SIXTEEN. WHICH WAS AGAIN SUBSEQUENTLY VETOED BY THE GOVERNOR- IN THIS MESSAGE THE GOVERNOR SHARED HIS CONCERNS AND ASK THAT THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER OTHER APPROACHES- SO THAT THAT NO WORKERS ARE LEFT BEHIND- AS THE ECONOMY REOPENS AND AS WE'VE KIND OF NOTED SEVERAL TIMES THIS MORNING. THAT YOU KNOW THE ECONOMY IS HOPEFUL THAT'LL BE REOPEN IN THE COMING MONTHS AND SO AFTER DISCUSSIONS- MANY OF THOSE CONCERNS ARE ADDRESSED IN THIS BILL- A BEAUTY FOR WHICH- AS NOTED- BY A COUPLE MEMBERS THIS MORNING THAT WAS THOROUGHLY DEBATED. LAST YEAR- MORE SPECIFICALLY THOSE THOSE THOSE- ELEMENTS THAT WERE ADDRESSED IS THE ELIMINATED- THE REQUIREMENT FOR THE EMPLOYEE TO YOU KNOW PROVIDE CERTAIN. INFORMATION AND THEN ALSO IT NEARLY DEFINE THE COLGATE- STATED THE MARGIN C. AS BEING THAT THE TARGET FOR THIS SO IT VERY NARROWLY- CRAFTED AT AB EIGHTY FOUR. I THANK SIR BUT I UNDERSTAND DEATHS IN THERE IRRELEVANT ANSWER. WHATEVER HAPPENED LAST YEAR DOES NOT APPLY TO THIS YEAR. WHAT FLIES AND WHAT COUNTS IS WHAT WE DEAL WITH NOW. AND WHAT THE BILL DOES SAY IN THE PROCESS THROUGH WHICH IT. TRANSCEND TRANSCEND THE PROCESS. AND I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS GOING TO REQUIRE ME TO GO TO LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL AND GET A LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL OPINION. I'M NOT SATISFIED WITH THE RESPONSE. LET ME SEE IF THERE'S ANY MORE. MIKE SUB CENTER CORTESE. WE CAN MANAGER I JUST SAW A WONDERFUL- PHONE- MY COLLEAGUES QUESTIONS REGARDING. RIGHT TO CURE THE BILL IT READS LIKE A STRIP CLUB BILITY. PROCESS AS OPPOSED TO A RIGHT TO CARE BUT I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE. THE GENERAL ADMINISTRATION- OR PROCESS TO PROCESS THE LABOR COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE WOULD USE SO. I THINK SOME OF. SOME OF OUR COLLEAGUES HAVE RAISED THE ISSUE OF. NUANCE OF YOU KNOW SHOULD NOT GOING AFTER FOLKS WHO ARE- BUT PERHAPS HAVE CHANGED OUR BUSINESS MODEL HAVE SOME SORT OF. ISSUE BEYOND. WHAT THE COMPLAINT IS BECAUSE KOHLI NOW ON V. P. N. PLEASE COMPLAIN. IN A I DON'T KNOW IF- IF- LABOR COMMISSIONER I MEAN OF THEIR LABOR COMMISSION REPRESENTATIVE CAN. VERY QUICKLY AND IF IT CAN'T BE DONE QUICKLY I SUPPOSE IT WOULD BE HELPFUL INFORMATION TO HELP OFFLINE WE'RE VOTING TODAY SO I'D PREFER TO HEAR IT NOW. YOU KNOW A SORT OF A THREE MINUTE. OVERVIEW OF. OF WHAT THE PROCESS. WOULD IT WILL ACTUALLY DO COMPLAINT COMES IN WE KNOW THAT PART- I'M NOT CLEAR AFTER THAT WHETHER A COMPLIANCE ORDER IS THEN ISSUED- TO THE EMPLOYER. WHETHER RIGHT TO A HEARING IS ISSUED. AND IF SO. ARE THEY AT THAT POINT. JUST PUSHING BACK ON ON WAGES OR DO THEY STILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THE ENTIRE PENALTY VITIATED DURING DURING THAT PROCESS MEET SOME FROM GETTING THERE HAS TO BE SOME ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS. PRISON MINIMUM THE MINISTRY OF LAW PROCESS SOME KIND OF A HEARING. A BASED ON ASSUME SOME KIND OF A COMPLIANCE ORDER. I DON'T WANT TO ATTEMPT. TO CONFUSE THINGS HERE MYSELF BY TRYING TO CREATE A PROCESS I JUST LIKE TO HEAR. WHAT IS THAT PROCESS AND AT WHAT POINT. IT DOES- A MISUNDERSTANDING OR MISAPPLICATION. OF THE COMPLAINT PROCESS- GET GET AN EMPLOYER OFF THE HOOK ON. ON THE PENALTIES THAT ARE CALLED OF LEGISLATION WHICH IN THE LEGISLATION AGAIN LOOKALIKES FOR GLOBAL BE PENALTIES. YES LIKE I COULD I COULD SPEAK TO. YOU KNOW TO- THAT TO IN IN THE RESPECT THAT THE ENFORCEMENT- PROVISION IN THE BILL. REFERS TO EXISTING ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS THAT THE LABOR COMMISSIONER HAS HISTORICALLY UTILIZED- ENDED IN THE IMPLICATES THE YOU KNOW TWO OF OUR INVESTIGATIVE PROGRAMS- AND THAT IS OUR FEELING PERCENT PROGRAM- AS WELL AS THE HER RETALIATION COMPLAINT INVESTIGATION UNIT. BOTH DOUBLED- THEIR RESOURCES TO. INVESTIGATION AND- THAT INVESTIGATION IS THE SPEAKING TO THE PARTIES INVOLVED WHETHER THAT BE YOU KNOW THE CURRENT EMPLOYER OR A SUCCESSOR EMPLOYER UNDER THIS BILL. CANADA MINISTRY DETERMINATION WOULD THEN BE MADE INDICTED MINISTRY DETERMINATION WOULD BE IN THE FORM OF A CITATION IT WAS ISSUED BY OUR FIELD ENFORCEMENT UNIT. OR IT WOULD BE. DETERMINATION UNDER- THE- ACTUALLY NINETY EIGHT POINT SEVEN UNDER THE RETALIATION COMPLAINT. PROCESS SO- THERE WOULD BE A FINDING AND KNOWS WHAT CONSTITUTES ADMINISTRATIVE FINDINGS.AND ON THE SURFACE CITATION FRONT. OF THE EMPLOYER CAN THEN REQUEST A HEARING. BEFORE THE HEARING OFFICER SAID THE LABOR COMMISSIONER'S UNIT. WHO WOULD ISSUE A DETERMINATION- AFTER HEARING EVIDENCE PRESENTED BY BOTH SIDES THAT IS ALSO SUBJECT TO REVIEW BY A COURT IF AN EMPLOYER. IS UNSATISFIED WITH pINDIVIDUAL RELIEF- ARM ABOVE THE REMEDIES UNDER THIS SECTION. OF THE DETERMINATION THAT WOULD BE ISSUED BY THE% LABOR COMMISSIONER- WOULD BE SENT TO THE EMPLOYER ANY SUCCESSOR EMPLOYERS THAT. ARE APPROPRIATE. AND THEN YOU KNOW IN ORDER TO ENFORCE THAT WE WOULD FILE A LAWSUIT YOU KNOW IN- IN SUPERIOR COURT IN ORDER TO. YOU KNOW TOO WELL AND FORCE THAT ADMINISTRATIVE DETERMINATION. SO BECAUSE- EXISTENTIALLY DUE PROCESS THAT WOULD BE EMBODIED IN THE FUTURE JUST A POLL QUESTION MR THE LOBOS IS IT YOUR- UNDERSTANDING OF. THE PROCESS THAT YOU JUST DESCRIBED THAT THE HEARING OFFICER WOULD RETAIN ULTIMATE DISCRETION OVER. WHETHER PENALTIES. OUR KERN FORCED OR NOT THE SYSTEM FORCE OR NOT IS THAT HEARING OFFICER IN YOUR MIND TO DO THIS BILL STILL RETAIN. DISCRETION TO MAKE A DECISION. ABSOLUTELY YOU KNOW THE HEARING OFFICER HIS YOU KNOW FUNCTIONS YOU KNOW WHAT IT INDEPENDENT OF THE INVESTIGATION SO THEY WOULD BE BASING THEIR DETERMINATION NO ON THE EVIDENCE PRESENTED BY BOTH PARTIES- AT THE AT THE AT THE HEARING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU MANAGER. THIRTY FIVE A QUICK CLARIFICATION YOU YOU REFERENCE THE HEARING BUT AT THE POINT A COMPLAINT IS FILED THIS IN THE FIELD NEED THE EMPLOYER IS INFORMED AND THE EMPLOYER HAS THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE INFORMATION TO THE- THE FIELD. IN OTHER WORDS IT IS IT IT ISN'T NECESSARILY ALL THE WAY TO THE PROCESS OF A HEARING BEFORE THE EMPLOYER IS ABLE TO COMMUNICATE WHAT CARTERET RESPOND OKAY THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO MAKE SURE SO THERE'S ALWAYS THE POSSIBILITY THAT YOU WOULDN'T EVEN HAVE A HEARING THAT IN OTHER WORDS. LET'S SAY I MAKE THE COMPLAINT AND THE FIELD INVESTIGATORS INVESTIGATE THE EMPLOYER SUBMITS INFORMATION THAT THE INVESTIGATOR FEELS- CONTRADICTS THAT WHICH WAS PROVIDED THE COMPLAINT DEPENDING ON HOW YOU KNOW THE EXTENT OF THAT- THE THOROUGHNESS OF IT THE FIELD INVESTIGATOR COULD DENY A WITHOUT NECESSARILY IT HAVING TO GO TO A HEARING. IS NEXT SIR. YES YES THAT IS CORRECT. SAGAY YOU KNOW HIS HIS. YOU KNOW BASED ON THE INFORMATION THAT THE LABOR COMMISSIONER OBTAINS. AND THE SELECTED REDUCE. ORDERS RIGHT. RIGHT CENTER CORTESE CERTAINLY IF YOU HAVE ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS GO AHEAD. HELLO YOU KNOW THE ONLY QUESTION OTHER QUESTION I HAVE THANK YOU FOR IT FOR ASKING DONE I WAS JUST ABOUT TO SEE THE FLOOR HERE OF MR VIDEO LOBOS IS- TO UP TO WHAT EXTENT. HAS THE LABOR COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE BEEN ABLE TO TWO- CALCULATOR ANTICIPATE- SB NEEDED- YOU KNOW TO YOU KNOW TO BASICALLY EXECUTE ON THIS PROGRAM- IF THIS BECOMES LAW AND I. LET ME JUST PUT KNOW THAT AND SAY I THINK WE ALL UNDERSTAND- THAT THOSE PROJECTIONS WOULD BE SPECULATIVE- AT BEST BUT I'M I'M JUST WARNED IF. HE WERE OFFICES RUN THROUGH ANY CALCULATIONS ON THAT AT ALL IN TERMS OF JUST HER OWN CAPACITY TO KEEP UP WITH THE POTENTIAL OF DEMAND THE APPLICATION PROCESS. THAT THAT WE MIGHT ANTICIPATE FROM THE SAW. THANK YOU JUST GENERALLY STATE TO THAT YOU KNOW WITH THE LABOR COMMISSIONER RECOGNIZES THAT- FOCUSED RESOURCES WOULD HAVE TO. YOU KNOW BE APPLIED HE WENT OVER TO COMPLEMENT THIS BILL WILL BE GIVEN THE- THE CLEAR INTENT OF IT. HANDS HE DOES THAT WOULD REQUIRE US TO YOU KNOW- PRIOR TOR PRIORITIZE COMPLAINTS BY WORKERS IN THIS INDUSTRY- THAT IT WILL. GET INVOLVED IN A PUBLIC OUTREACH. NO LONGER YOU KNOW TO INFORM BOTH THE EMPLOYEE AND EMPLOYER COMMUNITIES. OF FONG. ABOVE THESE RECRUITMENT REQUIREMENTS. AND OTHER WE WOULD HAVE TO CLEARLY PUT ON OUR WEBSITE. YOU KNOW- DIRECTION. FAQS WHICH WOULD- YOU KNOW PROVIDE A YOUNG. SOURCE FOR THE POP TO CONSOLE AND IN DETERMINE THEIR- OBLIGATIONS AND- RIGHTS UNDER THE STEEP SECTION- FIGURE AGAIN FUTURE IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'VE DONE SOME WORK ON THAT I GUESS WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR IS WHETHER OR NOT YOU ANTICIPATE THE NEED FOR AUGMENTATION. OR NOT AT THIS POINT- COLLEAGUES AT THE. LET ME REPHRASE THE FRIEND THAT IS A QUESTION DO YOU NEED AUGMENTATION TO KEEP UP WITH THE DEMAND OF THIS PROGRAM THERE IS AN APPROPRIATION IN THE BILL- I AM- YOU CERTAINLY CAN HEAR HIS RESPONSE BUT I'M ASSUMING THAT THEY'VE MADE SOME ESTIMATION OF WHAT THEY FELT MIGHT. WHAT ADITIONAL RESOURCES THEY MAY NEED LIMIT I'M SURE THAT THANK YOU FOR. REFRAMING THE QUESTION- BUT I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE CAN OFFER LET ME PAUSE AND SAY I DON'T TRYING TO- DRAW THIS TODAY'S HEARING OUT ANY FURTHER THAN WE NEED TO WE'RE TRYING TO MOVE THINGS FORWARD I THINK I PERSONALLY THAT'S MY INTENT. ON THE OTHER HAND THERE CERTAINLY BEEN A CHALLENGE AT TIMES DURING COLD RESPONSE HELLO FOR THE STATE TO ESSENTIALLY PROHIBIT OR TURN ON A DIME IN IT CAN RAMP UP THE F. T. E. THAT'S NECESSARY- TO DEAL WITH- LAWS THAT CAN EVEN AUGMENTATION THAT'S A REALLY ACTION OR LAWS THAT TAKE EFFECT LIKE THIS ONE WOULD IMMEDIATELY AND FM CONSCIOUS WORKING FOR SOME ASSURANCE. THE. WITH THE APPROPRIATION. THAT ARCHER JUST REFERRED ME TO. THEY YOU ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO STAFF UP THIS TO PUT IT IN PLAIN ENGLISH QUICKLY ENOUGH. TO DEAL WITH THE NEEDS OF THE PROGRAM. CHRIS COOK HAD HIS HAND UP SO LET ME CALL ON HIM TO- TO SEE IF HE HAS AN ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION OR WHETHER WE GO BACK TO CONSISTENT LABOR COMMISSION GO AHEAD.

CENTER NIELSEN YOU CERTAINLY ARE ENTITLED TO MAKE THAT REQUEST OF LEDGECOUNCIL I'M NOT GONNA ASK THEM TO COME. TO OUR COMMITTEE WHEN WE STILL HAVE ANOTHER BILL TO HEAR BECAUSE THEY MAY.

THIS BILL INCLUDES CLEAN UP PROVISIONS THAT ENABLE THE STATE TO ADMINISTER THE ONE TIME GOLDEN STATE GRANT PAYMENTS TO ELIGIBLE RECIPIENTS. THE BILL ALSO EXTENDS THE CAPPING VERBAL ATTESTATION FLEXIBILITIES. END OF THE STATE OF EMERGENCY DUE TO THE CLUB IN NINETEEN PANDEMIC THIS **** FLEXIBILITY IS CURRENTLY NEEDED TO SUPPORT THE CAPPY APPLICANTS GIVEN THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION'S OFFICES REMAIN CLOSED TO THE PUBLIC IT ALSO PROVIDES THE DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES AUTHORITY TO CONTACT RECIPIENTS OF PROGRAMS THE DEPARTMENT OVERSEES NOTIFY THEM OF POTENTIAL ELIGIBILITY.
