ON OUR STREETS.

00:20:43.008 --> 00:20:45.243
BECAUSE THIS IS A TINY SUBSET OF

00:20:45.310 --> 00:20:46.812
OUR POPULATION.

00:20:46.878 --> 00:20:48.146
SAN FRANCISCO FOR EXAMPLE

00:20:48.213 --> 00:20:51.583
ESTIMATES THAT APPROXIMATELY 1%

00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:09.935
DEFINITION.

00:21:10.002 --> 00:21:12.704
FALLING APART ON OUR STREETS OF

PEOPLE WALK BY.

00:21:14.106 --> 00:21:15.474
AND THEY WONDER AND THEY GET

00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:17.909
ANGRY WHY IS NO ONE DOING

00:21:17.976 --> 00:21:19.978
ANYTHING ABOUT THIS.

00:21:20.045 --> 00:21:21.380
AND THE REASON IS THAT OUR

00:21:21.446 --> 00:21:22.814
CURRENT CONSERVATORSHIP LAWS

00:21:22.881 --> 00:21:24.149
WHICH WERE CONSTRUCTED A LONG

00:21:24.216 --> 00:21:26.184
TIME AGO OR NOT MEETING THE

00:21:26.251 --> 00:21:27.686
NEEDS OF THIS TINY SUBSET OF THE

00:21:27.753 --> 00:21:29.221
POPULATION.

00:21:29.287 --> 00:21:30.922
PARTICULARLY PEOPLE WHO ARE

00:21:30.989 --> 00:21:33.125
ADDICTED TO DRUGS AND WHO AFTER

00:21:33.191 --> 00:21:34.660
A SEVENTY TWO HOUR HOLD MAY

00:21:34.726 --> 00:21:36.862
SOBER UP AND APPEAR PERFECTLY

00:21:36.928 --> 00:21:37.996
NORMAL WHEN THEY GO BEFORE A

00:21:38.063 --> 00:21:39.331
JUDGE.

00:21:39.398 --> 00:21:42.000
NEVER MIND THAT THEY'VE BEEN

00:21:42.067 --> 00:21:42.634
FIFTY ONE FIFTY SEVEN TIMES IN

00:21:42.701 --> 00:21:44.369
THE LAST YEAR AND PROBABLY WILL

00:21:44.436 --> 00:21:45.103
BE AGAIN.

00:21:45.170 --> 00:21:47.739
IN THE NEXT SEVERAL WEEKS.

00:21:47.806 --> 00:21:49.274
LIKE ALL CONSERVATIVE SHIPS AND

00:21:49.341 --> 00:21:50.909
I I AM VERY VERY MINDFUL

00:21:50.976 --> 00:21:53.545
CONSERVATIVE SHIPS NEED TO BE WE

00:21:53.612 --> 00:21:54.646

00:21:54.713 --> 00:21:55.313
CARE.

00:21:55.380 --> 00:21:56.114
BECAUSE THIS IS BECAUSE THE

00:21:56.181 --> 00:21:57.549
PEOPLE'S CIVIL LIBERTIES WERE

00:21:57.616 --> 00:21:58.450
TALKING ABOUT [inaudible]

00:21:58.517 --> 00:22:00.185

LIKE OTHER CONSERVATIVE SHIPS

00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:03.288
MAINS MAINTAINS STRONG DUE

FOR WHOM CONSERVATORSHIP IS

00:22:06.491 --> 00:22:07.392
SOUGHT.

00:22:07.459 --> 00:22:09.461
JUDICIAL OVERSIGHT A RIGHT TO

00:23:34.913 --> 00:23:36.748
VULNERABLE RESIDENTS WHO ARE NOT

00:23:36.815 --> 00:23:38.350
JUST SUFFERING ON OUR STREETS

00:23:38.416 --> 00:23:39.785
AND CAN'T CARE FOR THEMSELVES

00:23:39.851 --> 00:23:41.987
WITH PEOPLE WHO SADLY ARE ALSO

00:23:42.053 --> 00:23:43.522
DYING ON OUR STREETS.

00:23:43.588 --> 00:23:45.624
THIS COULD HAPPEN TO ANYONE OF

00:23:45.690 --> 00:23:47.793
US AT ANY GIVEN TIME TO ANY ONE

00:23:47.859 --> 00:23:50.362
OF OUR FAMILY MEMBERS AND IT'S

00:23:50.428 --> 00:23:52.197
THE REAL TRAGIC UNFORTUNATE

00:23:52.264 --> 00:23:53.265
EXPERIENCE.

00:23:53.331 --> 00:23:55.400
BUT OUR CURRENT LAWS MAKE IT

00:23:55.467 --> 00:23:58.103
NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO DO ANYTHING

00:23:58.170 --> 00:24:00.272
ABOUT IT --

00:24:00.338 --> 00:24:03.241
AND I KNOW THAT IF IT WERE ME IF

00:24:03.308 --> 00:24:05.177
I WERE OUT THERE STRUGGLING --

00:24:05.243 --> 00:24:07.012
IN THIS PARTICULAR WAY I'D WANT

00:24:07.078 --> 00:24:09.047
SOMEONE TO HELP I WANT SOMEONE

00:24:09.114 --> 00:24:10.182
TO STEP IN.

00:24:10.248 --> 00:24:12.484
OUR CITY DOES HAVE A LONG

00:24:12.551 --> 00:24:13.451
HISTORY OF PROVIDING

00:24:13.518 --> 00:24:16.054
COMPASSIONATE CARE AND WE

00:24:16.121 --> 00:24:18.924
ABSOLUTELY AGREE THAT LIMITING

00:24:18.990 --> 00:24:21.760
ANYONE'S CIVIL LIBERTIES MUST BE

00:24:21.827 --> 00:24:24.129
APPROACHED WITH CAUTION.

00:24:24.196 --> 00:24:25.730
AND AT THE SAME TIME WE CAN'T

00:24:25.797 --> 00:24:27.799
IGNORE THE HEARTBREAKING SCENES

00:24:27.866 --> 00:24:30.769
THAT WE SEE EVERY SINGLE DAY I

00:24:30.836 --> 00:24:32.771
HAVE PEOPLE ON MY PERSONAL

00:24:32.838 --> 00:24:34.739
CASELOAD PEOPLE THAT I HAVE

00:24:34.806 --> 00:24:36.308
TRIED TO HELP THAT I'VE GOTTEN

00:24:36.374 --> 00:24:38.143
INTO OUR SHELTER SYSTEM. ONE

00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:40.011
INDIVIDUAL IN PARTICULAR WHO IS

00:24:40.078 --> 00:24:42.747
UNFORTUNATELY A SCHIZOPHRENIC HE

00:24:42.814 --> 00:24:46.184
HAS CHALLENGES WITH A DRUG ABUSE --

00:24:46.251 --> 00:24:47.986
HE IS A SENIOR CENTER SEND OUR

00:24:48.053 --> 00:24:49.721
PEOPLE LOVE HIM IN THE COMMUNITY

00:24:49.788 --> 00:24:50.856
AND THEY WANT TO HELP HIM BUT

00:24:50.922 --> 00:24:52.724
EVERY NOW AND THEN THERE ARE A

00:24:52.791 --> 00:24:54.359
NUMBER OF ISSUES WHEN HE CATCHES

00:24:54.426 --> 00:24:55.327
HIS CHECK AT THE BEGINNING OF

00:24:55.393 --> 00:24:56.995
THE MONTH HE ALWAYS GETS ITS

00:24:57.062 --> 00:24:57.896
MONEY TAKEN BY.

00:24:57.963 --> 00:25:00.832
OTHER PEOPLE ON OUR STREETS HE

00:25:00.899 --> 00:25:02.167
GETS INTO WITH THE POLICE HAVE

00:25:02.234 --> 00:25:04.269
MANY APOLOGIZES LATER WE'VE HAD

00:25:04.336 --> 00:25:06.204
HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES FOR HIM

00:25:06.271 --> 00:25:08.240

SUPPORT AND HELP LOOK AFTER HIM

00:25:13.578 --> 00:25:14.980
BECAUSE HE CLEARLY CANNOT MAKE

00:25:15.046 --> 00:25:16.815
DECISIONS FOR HIMSELF I HAVE

00:25:16.882 --> 00:25:18.884
OTHER FOLKS IN OUR COMMUNITY AND

00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:20.418
THIS IS JUST IN MY DISTRICT.

00:25:20.485 --> 00:25:22.988
WHO HAVE FAMILY MEMBERS WHO WANT

00:25:23.054 --> 00:25:24.356
TO SUPPORT THEM BUT THE CURRENT

00:25:24.422 --> 00:25:26.725
LAWS MAKE IT SO DIFFICULT AND IN

00:25:26.791 --> 00:25:28.827
ALL OF THESE INSTANCES THESE ARE

00:25:28.894 --> 00:25:30.896
PEOPLE WHO ARE ACTUALLY?

00:25:30.962 --> 00:25:32.497
IN THEIR SIXTIES.

00:25:32.564 --> 00:25:33.031
AND THEY'RE LIVING ON OUR

00:25:33.098 --> 00:25:34.666
STREETS.

00:25:34.733 --> 00:25:36.201
AND WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING MORE

00:25:36.268 --> 00:25:38.470
THIS IS A TOOL THAT CAN HELP US

00:25:38.536 --> 00:25:39.905
GET TO A BETTER PLACE.

00:25:39.971 --> 00:25:41.673
AND WE KNOW THAT FOR A SMALL

00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:43.508
SUBSET OF THIS POPULATION THE

00:25:43.575 --> 00:25:45.844
COMBINE A FACT OF UNTREATED

00:25:45.911 --> 00:25:47.412
MENTAL ILLNESS AND SUBSTANCE

00:25:47.479 --> 00:25:48.980
ABUSE DISORDER.

00:25:49.047 --> 00:25:50.849
IS DEVASTATING AND LEAVES THEM

00:25:50.916 --> 00:25:53.285
UNABLE TO CARE FOR THEMSELVES WE

00:25:53.351 --> 00:25:54.953
SEE MANY OF THESE INDIVIDUALS

00:25:55.020 --> 00:25:57.956
ACROSS MANY SYSTEMS OF CARE

00:25:58.023 --> 00:25:59.491
SEVERAL TIMES A YEAR.

00:25:59.557 --> 00:26:02.093
AND WE CAN BREAK THE CYCLE WE

00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:04.329
CAN TO PREVENT THEM FROM CYCLING

00:26:04.396 --> 00:26:06.264
IN AND OUT OF OUR HOSPITALS AND

00:26:06.331 --> 00:26:07.799
IN AND OUT OF OUR JAIL SYSTEMS

00:26:07.866 --> 00:26:09.067
WE ARE CURRENTLY.

00:26:09.134 --> 00:26:12.537
USING OUR JAILS TO HOUSE PEOPLE

00:26:12.604 --> 00:26:14.005
WHO NEED TREATMENT.

00:26:14.072 --> 00:26:16.274
S. B. TEN FOUR FIVE HELPS US DO

00:26:16.341 --> 00:26:17.509
JUST THAT.

00:26:17.575 --> 00:26:19.311
WE KNOW THAT WITH ENOUGH TIME

00:26:19.377 --> 00:26:20.812
ENOUGH SUPPORT THE RIGHT

00:26:20.879 --> 00:26:23.715
SERVICES THAT WE CAN HELP PEOPLE

00:26:23.782 --> 00:26:25.884
RECOVER BUT IN ORDER TO ENSURE

00:26:25.951 --> 00:26:27.886
THAT INDIVIDUALS CAN BE HEALTHY.

00:26:27.953 --> 00:26:29.421
THEY CAN BE HOW THEY CAN BE

00:26:29.487 --> 00:26:31.323
STABILIZE FOR THE LONG TERM THEY

00:26:31.389 --> 00:26:33.191
NEED A GUARDIAN THEY NEED AN

00:26:33.258 --> 00:26:35.327
ADVOCATE SOMEONE WHO CAN MAKE

00:26:35.393 --> 00:26:36.728
DECISIONS FOR THEM BECAUSE THEY

00:26:36.795 --> 00:26:38.363
CLEARLY CANNOT MAKE DECISIONS

00:26:38.430 --> 00:26:39.831
FOR THEMSELVES.

00:26:39.898 --> 00:26:41.499
WITH THIS BILL WE SEE AN

00:26:41.566 --> 00:26:43.535
OPPORTUNITY TO HELP PEOPLE GET

00:26:43.601 --> 00:26:46.237
STABILIZE AND A SAFE PLACE TO

00:26:46.304 --> 00:26:48.006
SLEEP AT NIGHT AND ACCESS TO

00:26:48.073 --> 00:26:50.742
INTENSIVE TARGETED SERVICES WE

00:26:50.809 --> 00:26:52.077
ARE TALKING ABOUT MAKING A

00:26:52.143 --> 00:26:53.144
MEANINGFUL DIFFERENCE IN THE

00:26:53.211 --> 00:26:55.180
LIVES OF WHAT I'M OUNCE.

00:26:55.246 --> 00:26:57.315
TO LESS THAN 1% OF OUR HOMELESS

00:26:57.382 --> 00:26:59.584
POPULATION IN SAN FRANCISCO.

00:26:59.651 --> 00:27:01.286
AND I THINK THAT THE CHALLENGE

00:27:01.353 --> 00:27:03.555
WE HAVE UP IN SAN FRANCISCO WITH

00:27:03.621 --> 00:27:05.190
HOMELESSNESS IS OF COURSE A

00:27:05.256 --> 00:27:06.825
BROADER ISSUE IT REQUIRES A

00:27:06.891 --> 00:27:08.860
NUMBER OF SOLUTIONS TO GET TO A

00:27:08.927 --> 00:27:09.694
BETTER PLACE.

00:27:09.761 --> 00:27:11.329
BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE

00:27:11.396 --> 00:27:13.031
WHO WE DO HAVE THE ABILITY TO

00:27:13.098 --> 00:27:15.633
HELP AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE.

00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:18.303
ON THAT WE'RE NOT JUST ALLOW --

00:27:18.370 --> 00:27:19.938
PEOPLE WHO CAN'T CARE FOR

00:27:20.005 --> 00:27:22.173
THEMSELVES ARE TO BE ON THEIR

00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:24.376
OWN TO BE LEFT ON OUR STREETS

00:27:24.442 --> 00:27:26.678
BECAUSE THEY HAVE RIGHTS AND I

00:27:26.745 --> 00:27:28.713
KNOW THAT'S A HARSH THING TO SAY.

00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:31.116
BUT THE FACT IS WHAT WE'RE DOING

00:27:31.182 --> 00:27:32.751
IS NOT HUMANE.

00:27:32.817 --> 00:27:34.452
IT'S NOT COMPASSION AND WE CAN

00:27:34.519 --> 00:27:36.154
DO BETTER.

00:27:36.221 --> 00:27:37.889
SAN FRANCISCO IS READY AND

00:27:37.956 --> 00:27:39.190

OCCUPIED.

00:27:46.331 --> 00:27:48.133
OUR ULTIMATE GOAL IS TO MAKE

00:27:48.199 --> 00:27:50.769
SURE THAT WE CAN SUPPORT PEOPLE

00:27:50.835 --> 00:27:52.103
THAT THEY CAN LIVE ON THEIR OWN

00:27:52.170 --> 00:27:53.705
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY THAT THEY

00:27:53.772 --> 00:27:55.740
HAVE AN ADVOCATE AND SOMEONE.

00:27:55.807 --> 00:27:57.442
WHO CAN MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE

00:27:57.509 --> 00:27:59.010

MORE FRUSTRATING FOR MY

CONSTITUENTS AND NO PUB PUBLIC

00:28:53.031 --> 00:28:55.266
POLICY FAILURE IS MORE OBVIOUS.

00:28:55.333 --> 00:28:56.968
PAINFUL AND EMBARRASSING TO OUR

00:28:57.035 --> 00:28:58.803
CITY THAT OUR INABILITY TO

00:28:58.870 --> 00:29:00.105
PROVIDE CARE TO SO MANY

00:29:00.171 --> 00:29:02.540
OBVIOUSLY SICK PEOPLE ON OUR

00:29:02.607 --> 00:29:04.342
STREETS AND IN OUR PUBLIC SPACES.

00:29:04.409 --> 00:29:05.877
FOR ME IT'S PERSONAL MY MOTHER

00:29:10.248 --> 00:29:10.715
YOUNG.

00:29:10.782 --> 00:29:11.950
I KNOW FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE

00:29:12.016 --> 00:29:13.017
THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE

00:29:13.084 --> 00:29:15.120
UNABLE TO CARE FOR THEMSELVES

00:29:15.186 --> 00:29:16.788
AND IT IS UNREASONABLE TO EXPECT

00:29:16.855 --> 00:29:18.156
THOSE PEOPLE TO VOLUNTARILY

00:29:18.223 --> 00:29:19.724
ACCESS SERVICES.

00:29:19.791 --> 00:29:21.159

00:29:26.764 --> 00:29:28.032
ENVIRONMENT BUT THE LEAST

00:29:28.099 --> 00:29:29.734
RESTRICTIVE LIVING ENVIRONMENT

00:29:29.801 --> 00:29:32.003
CANNOT BE A SIDEWALK. TOO MANY

RELENTLESS AND COSTLY MERRY GO

00:29:36.341 --> 00:29:38.209
STREETS TO THE HOSPITAL BACK TO

00:29:38.276 --> 00:29:40.445
THE STREETS TO JAIL AND AROUND

00:29:40.512 --> 00:29:42.380
AND AROUND AND AROUND AND IT IS

00:29:42.447 --> 00:29:43.248
INHUMANE.

00:29:43.314 --> 00:29:44.382
IT IS EXPENSIVE AND IT HAS TO

00:29:44.449 --> 00:29:45.884
STOP.

00:29:45.950 --> 00:29:47.352
SAN FRANCISCO DID NOT CREATE

OPPOSED TO THE APPROACH THAT SAN

AND THAT IS A CENTERPIECE TO THE

00:31:45.069 --> 00:31:47.705
WORK THAT WE DO WHETHER THAT BE --

00:31:47.772 --> 00:31:49.874

LEAST I WILL SAY IN THE CONTEXT

00:32:08.693 --> 00:32:10.662
OF CONSERVATORSHIP IS REALLY A

00:32:10.728 --> 00:32:11.929
BROKEN SYSTEM.

00:32:11.996 --> 00:32:13.631
AND TO TRY AND OPEN THOSE GATES

00:32:13.698 --> 00:32:16.067
WIDER TO FORCE INDIVIDUALS INTO

00:32:16.134 --> 00:32:17.235
THAT SYSTEM WITHOUT THE

00:32:17.302 --> 00:32:19.771
ASSURANCE OF SERVICES WHETHER

00:32:19.837 --> 00:32:21.572
THAT'S SUPPORTIVE HOUSING --

00:32:21.639 --> 00:32:23.541
WRAPAROUND SERVICES ENSURING

00:32:23.608 --> 00:32:25.176

THESE INDIVIDUALS THAT THEY DO

00:32:32.817 --> 00:32:34.385
IN FACT HAVE THE ABILITY TO BE

00:32:34.452 --> 00:32:36.421
ABLE TO RESIDE IN IN THEIR

00:32:36.487 --> 00:32:37.455
COMMUNITIES.

00:32:37.522 --> 00:32:39.257
IT AND I JUST WANT TO MAKE ONE

00:32:39.324 --> 00:32:42.226
OTHER COMMENT ON THE FACT THAT --

00:32:42.293 --> 00:32:45.530
DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA --

00:32:45.596 --> 00:32:46.798

00:32:46.864 --> 00:32:48.433
ORGANIZATION IN THIS COUNTRY WE

00:32:48.499 --> 00:32:49.901
HAVE OVER TWO HUNDRED PEOPLE

00:32:49.967 --> 00:32:51.002
THROUGHOUT THE STATE OR A

00:32:51.069 --> 00:32:52.103
HUNDRED LAWYERS THAT WORK ON

00:32:52.170 --> 00:32:53.471
THESE ISSUES WE KNOW THE

00:32:53.538 --> 00:32:55.039
POPULATION WELL.

00:32:55.106 --> 00:32:56.974
WE DO LITIGATION IN THE JAILS

00:32:57.041 --> 00:32:58.276
CONCERNING THE MENTAL HEALTH

00:32:58.343 --> 00:33:00.678
CARE WE WE UNDERSTAND WELL I'D I

00:33:00.745 --> 00:33:02.814
HOPE THAT THE COMMITTEE WOULD

00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:04.215
NOT WALK AWAY AND I KNOW IT IS

00:33:04.282 --> 00:33:06.617
NOT THE INTENT --

00:33:06.684 --> 00:33:08.786
THAT OUR POSITION IS INDEED AND

00:33:08.853 --> 00:33:11.456
IN HUMANE POSITION WE TAKE A

00:33:11.522 --> 00:33:12.790
DIFFERENT APPROACH TO ASSURE

00:33:12.857 --> 00:33:14.692
THAT INDIVIDUALS ARE RECEIVING

00:33:14.759 --> 00:33:15.493
THE CARE.

00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:16.994
THAT I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE AND

00:33:17.061 --> 00:33:18.963
THANK THE THE HELP THAT YOU

00:33:19.030 --> 00:33:20.298
COMMITTEE COUNSEL BOTH HERE AND

00:33:20.365 --> 00:33:21.799
THIS COMMITTEE AND THE HEALTH

00:33:21.866 --> 00:33:22.400
COMMITTEE FOR THE WORK THAT

00:33:22.467 --> 00:33:23.101
THEY'VE HAD.

00:33:23.167 --> 00:33:24.902
AT I THINK IN CRAFTING A SET OF

00:33:24.969 --> 00:33:26.804
AMENDMENTS THAT WILL MAKE THIS

00:33:26.871 --> 00:33:28.239
BILL -- A

00:33:28.306 --> 00:33:30.408
LOT STRONGER BILL FOR ASSURING

00:33:30.475 --> 00:33:32.643
WHAT WE'VE STARTED AS NECESSARY

00:33:32.710 --> 00:33:34.812
IT AND THESE AMENDMENTS DO SOME

00:33:34.879 --> 00:33:36.848
I FLEW FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE VERY

00:33:36.914 --> 00:33:37.815
KEY THINGS.

00:33:37.882 --> 00:33:39.951
TIME LIMITS THIS PROJECT MAKES

00:33:40.017 --> 00:33:41.486
IT A PILOT PROJECT --

00:33:41.552 --> 00:33:43.187
THE COUNTY MUST DEVELOP AN UP

00:33:43.254 --> 00:33:45.189
FRONT PLAN ON HOW THEY WOULD

00:33:45.256 --> 00:33:46.791
IMPLEMENT --

00:33:46.858 --> 00:33:49.961
THE PROJECT AND IMPORT THE THAT

00:33:50.027 --> 00:33:51.696
HAS TO BE DONE WITH THE

00:33:51.763 --> 00:33:53.631
INVOLVEMENT OF STAKEHOLDERS AND

00:33:53.698 --> 00:33:54.932
DISABILITY RIGHTS AND OTHER

00:33:54.999 --> 00:33:56.167
ORGANIZATIONS.

00:33:56.234 --> 00:33:58.236
IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THAT --

00:33:58.302 --> 00:34:00.271
THAT IT MUST ACTUALLY BE ADOPTED

00:34:00.338 --> 00:34:02.707
BY THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS ONCE.

00:34:02.774 --> 00:34:04.308
ONCE THERE IS A PLAN AND THERE

00:34:04.375 --> 00:34:05.576
MUST BE A COMMITMENT OF THE

00:34:05.643 --> 00:34:07.879
ASSURANCES THAT THERE WILL BE

00:34:07.945 --> 00:34:09.981
SERVICES PROVIDED --

00:34:10.047 --> 00:34:13.384
AND WRAPAROUND DE HOUSING --

00:34:13.451 --> 00:34:14.919
AND I THINK THAT CENTRAL THEME

00:34:14.986 --> 00:34:17.388
THROUGHOUT THE THE AMENDMENTS IS

00:34:17.455 --> 00:34:19.424
THIS MUST BE DONE IN THE LEAST

00:34:19.490 --> 00:34:20.925
RESTRICTIVE --

00:34:20.992 --> 00:34:23.461
ALTERNATIVE AND WE THINK THAT'S

00:34:23.528 --> 00:34:25.062
ESSENTIAL --

00:34:25.129 --> 00:34:27.965
BUT WE DO WANT TO BE CLEAR ABOUT

00:34:28.032 --> 00:34:29.233
ONE THING THAT I THINK IS

00:34:29.300 --> 00:34:31.335
IMPORTANT THAT YOU TINKERING

00:34:31.402 --> 00:34:33.037
WITH --

00:34:33.104 --> 00:34:35.239
INVOLUNTARY COMMITMENTS IS NOT

00:34:35.306 --> 00:34:37.408
THE ANSWER TO THE PROBLEM THAT

00:34:37.475 --> 00:34:39.510
EXISTS IN OUR CITY COUNTY

00:34:39.577 --> 00:34:41.179
STREETS RIGHT NOW.

00:34:41.245 --> 00:34:43.347
IT IS FUNDAMENTALLY A LACK OF

00:34:43.414 --> 00:34:44.148
HOUSING.

00:34:44.215 --> 00:34:45.917
AND FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS IT IS

00:34:45.983 --> 00:34:47.585
FUNDAMENTALLY A LACK OF HOUSING

00:34:47.652 --> 00:34:48.853
SUPPORTIVE HOUSING.

00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:51.189
AND SUPPORTIVE SERVICES THAT ARE

00:34:51.255 --> 00:34:53.458
NOT BEING MADE AVAILABLE TO THEM

00:34:53.524 --> 00:34:55.293
THAT'S THE ANSWER AND WE WOULD

00:34:55.359 --> 00:34:57.195
HOPE THAT THE THIS COMMITTEE AND

00:34:57.261 --> 00:34:58.396
AND WE KNOW --

00:34:58.463 --> 00:35:01.132
CERTAINLY THE THE SITTING.

00:35:01.199 --> 00:35:03.701
CSCO STAYS FOCUSED ON THIS

00:35:03.768 --> 00:35:05.369
THAT'S THE REAL ANSWER THAT'S

00:35:05.436 --> 00:35:08.339
THE REAL SOLUTION THAT WE NEED

00:35:08.406 --> 00:35:10.575
TO GET TO AND THAT --

00:35:10.641 --> 00:35:12.710
WE SUPPORT SO AGAIN I THINK THIS

00:35:12.777 --> 00:35:14.178
MAKES -- A

00:35:14.245 --> 00:35:16.447
MUCH BETTER BILL A IF YOU HAVE

00:35:16.514 --> 00:35:17.915
TO STEP INTO A WORLD OF

00:35:17.982 --> 00:35:19.550
INVOLUNTARY --

00:35:19.617 --> 00:35:21.385
CARE BUT BECAUSE I IT IT IS

00:35:21.452 --> 00:35:23.688
STILL INVOLUNTARY IT HAS THE

00:35:23.754 --> 00:35:25.089
INVOLUNTARY NESS OPTION

00:35:25.156 --> 00:35:26.457
ULTIMATELY TODAY AND WE REMAIN

00:35:26.524 --> 00:35:27.425
OPPOSED [inaudible]

00:35:27.492 --> 00:35:29.227
THANK YOU.

00:35:29.293 --> 00:35:30.361
NEXT WITNESS PLEASE OOD

00:35:30.428 --> 00:35:31.963
AFTERNOON CHEN FLOOR ON BEHALF

00:35:32.029 --> 00:35:33.264
OF WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND

00:35:33.331 --> 00:35:34.065
POVERTY -- I

00:35:34.131 --> 00:35:35.433
REITERATE HER CHILD'S COMMENTS

00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:36.801
REGARDING THE AMENDMENTS I MEAN

00:35:36.868 --> 00:35:38.870
I THINK WE ARE GOING DOWN THE

00:35:38.936 --> 00:35:40.471
PATH OF CONSERVATORSHIP WE'VE

00:35:40.538 --> 00:35:41.539
ADDED MORE DUE PROCESS

00:35:41.606 --> 00:35:43.307
PROTECTIONS --

00:35:43.374 --> 00:35:45.510
AND AND IMPORTANTLY DE

00:35:45.576 --> 00:35:47.311
INCENTIVIZING CRIMINALIZING

00:35:47.378 --> 00:35:48.379
HOMELESSNESS THOSE ARE VERY

00:35:48.446 --> 00:35:49.514
IMPORTANT TO WESTERN CENTER I

00:35:49.580 --> 00:35:51.015
THINK THE AUTHOR FOR ACCEPTING

00:35:51.082 --> 00:35:51.949
THOSE AMENDMENTS IN THE

00:35:52.016 --> 00:35:52.984
COMMITTEE FOR WORKING ON THOSE

00:35:53.050 --> 00:35:54.785
AMENDMENTS AND IDENTIFYING THOSE

00:35:54.852 --> 00:35:55.620
ISSUES.

00:35:55.686 --> 00:35:58.122
HOWEVER SP TEN FORTY FIVE IN

00:35:58.189 --> 00:35:59.824
MANY WAYS REPRESENTS A COMPLETE

00:35:59.891 --> 00:36:01.592
FAILURE OF UPSTREAM SOLUTIONS TO

00:36:01.659 --> 00:36:02.860
AVOID THE PROBLEM IN THE FIRST

00:36:02.927 --> 00:36:04.262
PLACE I THINK MANY OF THE

00:36:04.328 --> 00:36:05.329
INDIVIDUALS THAT YOU'VE HEARD

00:36:05.396 --> 00:36:07.131
ABOUT AT SOME POINT IN THEIR

00:36:07.198 --> 00:36:07.532
LIFE.

00:36:07.598 --> 00:36:08.199
THERE COULD HAVE BEEN AN

00:36:08.266 --> 00:36:09.634
INTERVENTION WHERE SUPPORTIVE

00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:17.842
HOUSING WITH WRAPAROUND SERVICES

00:36:17.909 --> 00:36:19.477
EARLY MENTAL HEALTH OR DRUG.

00:36:19.544 --> 00:36:20.978
PROBABLY NOTHING I SAY HERE IS

00:36:21.045 --> 00:36:22.146
GOING TO STOP THIS BILL FROM

00:36:22.213 --> 00:36:23.714
BEING PASSED TO COMMITTEE AND I

00:36:23.781 --> 00:36:25.082
UNDERSTAND THAT MANY OF THOSE

00:36:25.149 --> 00:36:26.717
VOTES TODAY ARE COMING FROM A

00:36:26.784 --> 00:36:28.119
REAL AND GENUINE PLACE OF

00:36:28.185 --> 00:36:29.153
WANTING TO DO SOMETHING.

00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:30.855
FROM HUMAN COMPASSION.

00:36:30.922 --> 00:36:32.423
SO IF THAT'S THE CASE THEN I

00:36:32.490 --> 00:36:34.425
ALSO OFFER THIS CHALLENGE

00:36:34.492 --> 00:36:35.493
CONSERVATORSHIP CAN'T BE OUR

00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:37.295
SAFETY NET.

00:36:37.361 --> 00:36:39.030
THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS THE UN

00:36:39.096 --> 00:36:40.498
HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL HAS SENT

00:36:40.565 --> 00:36:42.366
SPECIAL RAPPORTEURS ON HOUSING

00:36:42.433 --> 00:36:44.101
RIGHTS AND ON EXTREME POVERTY TO

00:36:44.168 --> 00:36:46.370
BOTH SAN FRANCISCO AND LA AND

00:36:46.437 --> 00:36:47.805
THE CONDITIONS THEY DESCRIBED

00:36:47.872 --> 00:36:49.173
WERE SO DEPLORABLE AND SO

00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:49.774
SKATING.

00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:51.075
THAT IS A LARGE PART OF THE

00:36:51.142 --> 00:36:52.109
REASON THAT THE TRUMP

00:36:52.176 --> 00:36:54.111
ADMINISTRATION PULLED THE U. S.

00:36:54.178 --> 00:36:54.645
OUT OF THE UN HUMAN RIGHTS

00:36:54.712 --> 00:36:55.913
COUNCIL.

00:36:55.980 --> 00:36:57.682
NO WHERE IN THEIR REPORTS DID

00:36:57.748 --> 00:36:58.950
THEY IDENTIFY THE LACK OF

00:36:59.016 --> 00:37:00.384
CONSERVATORSHIP SINCE THE

00:37:00.451 --> 00:37:01.586
BECAUSE OF EXTREME HUMAN RIGHTS

00:37:01.652 --> 00:37:03.254
VIOLATIONS THAT ARE ENCOURAGING.

00:37:03.321 --> 00:37:04.922
INSTEAD THEY IDENTIFIED A

00:37:04.989 --> 00:37:06.023
FAILURE TO CONTROL THE REAL

00:37:06.090 --> 00:37:07.792
ESTATE MARKET A LACK OF

00:37:07.858 --> 00:37:09.527
AFFORDABLE IN SUPPORT OF HOUSING

00:37:09.594 --> 00:37:11.495
THE CRIMINALIZATION OF POVERTY

00:37:11.562 --> 00:37:12.897
INCLUDING SWEEPS OF HOMELESS

00:37:12.964 --> 00:37:14.465
INDIVIDUALS AND REMOVING THEIR

00:37:14.532 --> 00:37:15.266
POSSESSIONS.

00:37:15.333 --> 00:37:16.834
AND OTHER STRUCTURAL PROBLEMS

00:37:16.901 --> 00:37:18.569
SUCH AS OUR TAX POLICY.

00:37:18.636 --> 00:37:20.304
MANY OF THESE ARE ISSUES THAT

00:37:20.371 --> 00:37:22.740
THIS LEGISLATURE CAN'T TAKE ON

00:37:22.807 --> 00:37:24.609
NOW I BELIEVE SENATOR WIENER

00:37:24.675 --> 00:37:25.843
THAT HIS INTENT FOR THIS BILL IS

00:37:25.910 --> 00:37:26.911
TO DETER ADDRESS A VERY

00:37:26.978 --> 00:37:28.813
PARTICULAR SUBSET OF PEOPLE WHO

00:37:28.879 --> 00:37:30.648
CANNOT CARE FOR THEMSELVES.

00:37:30.715 --> 00:37:31.782
BUT THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE NOT

00:37:31.849 --> 00:37:33.250
THE ONLY INDIVIDUALS WHO WILL

00:37:33.317 --> 00:37:35.286
DIE LIVING ON THE STREET.

00:37:35.353 --> 00:37:36.587
EVERY YEAR HUNDREDS OF THESE

00:37:36.654 --> 00:37:38.422
INDIVIDUALS DIE FROM EXPOSURE

00:37:38.489 --> 00:37:40.157
FROM VIOLENCE FROM TREATABLE

00:37:40.224 --> 00:37:41.926
DISEASE NOT BECAUSE THEY ARE

00:37:41.993 --> 00:37:43.060
UNAWARE OF HOW TO CARE FOR

00:37:43.127 --> 00:37:44.695
THEMSELVES BUT BECAUSE SOCIETY

00:37:44.762 --> 00:37:46.731
HAS FAILED.

00:37:46.797 --> 00:37:47.999
SO IF YOU'RE VOTING FOR THIS

00:37:48.065 --> 00:37:49.467
TODAY BECAUSE SOMETHING MUST BE

00:37:49.533 --> 00:37:50.735
DONE ABOUT THE CRISIS WE ARE

00:37:50.801 --> 00:37:52.470
FACING IN OUR STREETS THEN I

00:37:52.536 --> 00:37:54.505
ALSO ASK FOR YOURPARTNERSHIP.

00:37:54.572 --> 00:37:56.674
IN STOPPING THE ARRESTS OF

00:37:56.741 --> 00:37:57.642
HOMELESS PEOPLE LIVING ON THE

00:37:57.708 --> 00:37:59.243
STREETS WE'VE TRIED AT WESTERN

00:37:59.310 --> 00:38:00.978
CENTER TO ENACT A HOMELESS BILL

00:38:01.045 --> 00:38:02.179
OF RIGHTS IN THIS YEAR WE COULD

00:38:02.246 --> 00:38:03.481
EVEN GET AN AUTHOR.

00:38:03.547 --> 00:38:05.816
PASSING BASIC JUST BECAUSE

00:38:05.883 --> 00:38:07.518
PROTECTIONS FOR ADDICTION.

00:38:07.585 --> 00:38:09.253
FAILED THIS YEAR IN THE ASSEMBLY.

00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:10.554
ENSURING THAT MENTAL HEALTH ACT

00:38:10.621 --> 00:38:12.590
SERVICES DOLLARS ARE SPENT AS IT

00:38:12.657 --> 00:38:14.025
INTENDED AND THAT LOCALITY

00:38:14.091 --> 00:38:15.760
SENIOR DISTRICT ARE NOT BLOCKING

00:38:15.826 --> 00:38:16.761
THE CONSTRUCTION OF PERMANENT

00:38:16.827 --> 00:38:18.663
SUPPORTIVE HOUSING.

00:38:18.729 --> 00:38:19.997
FUNDING THE CONSTRUCTION OF OF

00:38:20.064 --> 00:38:21.799
OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN

00:38:21.866 --> 00:38:22.767
AVOIDING THE DISPLACEMENT OF LOW

00:38:22.833 --> 00:38:24.568
INCOME COMMUNITIES ADEQUATELY

00:38:24.635 --> 00:38:25.670
FUNDING OTHER SAFETY NET

00:38:25.736 --> 00:38:26.771
SERVICES SUCH AS CASH BENEFITS

00:38:26.837 --> 00:38:28.639
AND HEALTH CARE.

00:38:28.706 --> 00:38:29.840
TAKING AWAY AN INDIVIDUAL'S

00:38:29.907 --> 00:38:31.475
FREEDOM EVEN IF FOR THEIR OWN

00:38:31.542 --> 00:38:33.110
SAFETY IS A SERIOUS MATTER AND

00:38:33.177 --> 00:38:35.312
DEMOCRACY WE CANNOT GO THERE IF

00:38:35.379 --> 00:38:36.647
WE ARE NOT HONESTLY DOING

00:38:36.714 --> 00:38:38.049
EVERYTHING WE CAN TO AVOID SUCH

00:38:38.115 --> 00:38:40.518
SITUATIONS.

00:38:40.584 --> 00:38:42.153
SO WHILE WE STILL REMAIN OPPOSED

00:38:42.219 --> 00:38:43.320
I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH

00:38:43.387 --> 00:38:45.056

UNION OF CALIFORNIA.

00:38:57.201 --> 00:38:59.203
ALLEN GOOD MOTIVES DON'T JUSTIFY

00:38:59.270 --> 00:39:00.538
MISGUIDED ACTIONS ANYMORE THAN

00:39:00.604 --> 00:39:02.073
BAD MOTIVES.

00:39:02.139 --> 00:39:03.541

THROUGH THE SYSTEM WE ARE ALSO

00:39:22.526 --> 00:39:24.295
AN UNFORTUNATE POSITION TO TO

00:39:24.361 --> 00:39:26.230
THE SHORTFALL FUNDING AND OTHER --

00:39:26.297 --> 00:39:27.898
ISSUES THAT WERE RAISED BY OUR

00:39:27.965 --> 00:39:30.134
ALLIES THINK YOU VERY MUCH.

00:39:30.201 --> 00:39:32.103

00:39:34.872 --> 00:39:36.974
TO THAT COMMITTEE.

00:39:37.041 --> 00:39:38.943
THIS IS A DIFFICULT POSITION.

00:39:39.009 --> 00:39:42.513
AND I ABSOLUTELY AGREE THAT.

00:39:42.580 --> 00:39:43.948
SERVICE SHIPS NOT NECESSARILY

00:39:44.014 --> 00:39:46.484
THE RIGHT TOOL HERE.

00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:48.185
BUT WE HAVE SUCH AN EXPLOSION IN

00:39:48.252 --> 00:39:49.887
SUCH A CHALLENGE WITH DEALING

00:39:49.954 --> 00:39:50.755
WITH WITH HOMELESS [inaudible]

00:39:50.821 --> 00:39:52.456
THAT.

00:39:52.523 --> 00:39:54.091
I APPLAUD HIM JUST GO FOR REALLY

00:39:54.158 --> 00:39:55.426
TRY TO TAKE THE RIGHT STEPS BUT

00:39:55.493 --> 00:39:56.427
I THINK.

00:39:56.494 --> 00:39:57.628
WE CAN ALSO SEE SOME OF THE

00:39:57.695 --> 00:39:59.130
HOLES IN THE OVERALL SYSTEM WE

00:39:59.196 --> 00:40:00.698
DO HAVE A FRACTURED MENTAL

00:40:00.765 --> 00:40:02.333
HEALTH SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA.

00:40:02.399 --> 00:40:03.534
AND WE HAVE COUNTIES THAT ARE

00:40:03.601 --> 00:40:05.069
TAKING A LOT OF PROP SIXTY THREE

00:40:05.136 --> 00:40:06.403
MONEY BUT CAN'T FIGURE OUT HOW

00:40:06.470 --> 00:40:07.238
TO SPEND IT.

00:40:07.304 --> 00:40:08.873
PART OF THAT ARE THE COUNTIES

00:40:08.939 --> 00:40:10.508
ISSUES BECAUSE THERE ARE A BUT

00:40:10.574 --> 00:40:12.543
UNWILLINGNESS TO SPEND OR LACK

00:40:12.610 --> 00:40:13.677
OF A STRUCTURE SPEND IT PART

00:40:13.744 --> 00:40:14.779
THAT'S THE STATE.

00:40:14.845 --> 00:40:15.813
INCLUDING SO MANY IMPEDIMENTS IN

00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:17.214
PLACE.

00:40:17.281 --> 00:40:18.749
THAT LOW LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ARE

00:40:18.816 --> 00:40:19.817
AFRAID TO SPEND THE MONEY AND

00:40:19.884 --> 00:40:21.118
THEY'RE AFRAID TO SPEND THE

00:40:21.185 --> 00:40:22.586
MONEY IN WAYS THAT.

00:40:22.653 --> 00:40:23.888
THAT THEY'RE ALSO THREATENED BY

00:40:23.954 --> 00:40:25.856
NOT BE ABLE TO DRAW DOWN FEDERAL

00:40:25.923 --> 00:40:27.925
MONIES SO WE HAVE A CONCURRENCE

00:40:27.992 --> 00:40:30.361
OF A LOT OF DIFFERENT SYSTEMS

00:40:30.427 --> 00:40:32.797
THAT ARE JUST NOT WORKING.

00:40:32.863 --> 00:40:33.798
AND PEOPLE ARE ABSOLUTELY

00:40:33.864 --> 00:40:35.900
FALLING THROUGH THE CRACKS.

00:40:35.966 --> 00:40:38.302
SO FOR US WE REALLY STRUGGLED

00:40:38.369 --> 00:40:40.771
WITH THIS BILL THIS NOTION OF OF

00:40:40.838 --> 00:40:42.339
CONSERVING PEOPLE LOCKING PEOPLE

00:40:42.406 --> 00:40:43.641
UP TAKING AWAY.

00:40:43.707 --> 00:40:46.010
THEIR FREEDOMS THAT'S ULTIMATELY

00:40:46.076 --> 00:40:48.245
NOT THE ANSWER.

00:40:48.312 --> 00:40:51.182
BUT TRYING TO FIND A WAY. TO

00:40:51.248 --> 00:40:53.083
GIVE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS SOME

00:40:53.150 --> 00:40:55.419
TOOLS TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS SOME

00:40:55.486 --> 00:40:56.754
OF THE ISSUES THAT THEY'RE

00:40:56.821 --> 00:40:57.888
FINDING ON THEIR DOORSTEP.

00:40:57.955 --> 00:40:58.489
IS ALSO SOMETHING THAT I THINK

00:40:58.556 --> 00:41:01.158
THAT REPRESENTS AT THIS POINT

00:41:01.225 --> 00:41:03.694
AND WHY.

00:41:03.761 --> 00:41:05.462
THE I'M RECOMMENDING THAT WE

00:41:05.529 --> 00:41:06.797
THAT WE DO PASSED THIS BILL OUT.

00:41:06.864 --> 00:41:08.632
BUT WITH SOME CAUTIONS WHAT I

00:41:08.699 --> 00:41:10.501
DON'T WANT TO SEE IN THIS IS A

00:41:10.568 --> 00:41:11.702
FIVE YEAR PILOT AND WE'RE GOING

00:41:11.769 --> 00:41:13.304
TO BE WATCHING SAM CISCO AND AL

00:41:13.370 --> 00:41:14.538
A TO HEAR HOW THIS GETS

00:41:14.605 --> 00:41:16.640
IMPLEMENTED.

00:41:16.707 --> 00:41:17.808
BECAUSE I'M I'M CONCERNED THAT

00:41:17.875 --> 00:41:19.043
OTHER CHICK JURISDICTIONS AND

00:41:19.109 --> 00:41:19.877
SAY WELL LOOK WHAT'S AND CISCO'S

00:41:19.944 --> 00:41:22.346
DOING GIVE US THAT SAME ABILITY.

00:41:22.413 --> 00:41:23.647
WITHOUT THE WILLINGNESS TO PUT

00:41:23.714 --> 00:41:26.217
SUPPORTIVE PROGRAMS IN PLACE FOR

00:41:26.283 --> 00:41:26.717
THE PEOPLE THAT THEY ARE

00:41:26.784 --> 00:41:27.618
CONSERVING.

00:41:27.685 --> 00:41:29.687
AND SO SAN FRISCO IS NOT ABLE TO

00:41:29.753 --> 00:41:30.788
DO THAT OR IS UNWILLING TO DO

00:41:30.855 --> 00:41:32.957
THAT JUST PUTTING SOMEBODY ELSE

00:41:33.023 --> 00:41:34.658
IN CHARGE OF SOMEONE'S LIFE OR

00:41:34.725 --> 00:41:36.026
ENDING UP LOCKING SOMEBODY UP

00:41:36.093 --> 00:41:36.994
TAKING THEIR FREEDOMS AWAY FROM

00:41:37.061 --> 00:41:37.528
THEM.

00:41:37.595 --> 00:41:38.796
IS REALLY NOT GOING TO BE THE

00:41:38.863 --> 00:41:40.164
ANSWER.

00:41:40.231 --> 00:41:42.132
SO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BE

00:41:42.199 --> 00:41:44.568
VIGILANT IN THE LEGISLATURE NOW

00:41:44.635 --> 00:41:46.737
AND ARE GOING TO NEED SEARCHES

00:41:46.804 --> 00:41:48.372
GOING LA'S SUPPORT.

00:41:48.439 --> 00:41:50.941
AS THIS MOVE FORWARD.

00:41:51.008 --> 00:41:53.010
TO SHOW US HOW THIS COULD WORK.

00:41:53.077 --> 00:41:56.647
OR WHAT THE NEXT STEPS ARE THEN.

00:41:56.714 --> 00:41:57.481
IF WE'RE GONNA ALLOW THIS TO

00:41:57.548 --> 00:41:59.950
MOVE THAT WE THEN PROTECT

00:42:00.017 --> 00:42:01.151
AGAINST SOME OF THE FEARS THAT

00:42:01.218 --> 00:42:02.586
HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP.

00:42:02.653 --> 00:42:04.889
SO THAT'S REALLY WHAT'S BEFORE

00:42:04.955 --> 00:42:06.357
US TODAY IS TO SEE OKAY.

00:42:06.423 --> 00:42:07.758
GIVE IT A SHOT AND I THINK

00:42:07.825 --> 00:42:09.326
ANYBODY CAN FIGURE THIS OUT

00:42:09.393 --> 00:42:10.928
PROBABLY DESERVES CISCO YOU'VE

00:42:10.995 --> 00:42:11.528
SHOWN A WILLINGNESS TO RAISE

00:42:11.595 --> 00:42:13.264
FUNDS YOUR SON A WILLINGNESS TO

00:42:13.330 --> 00:42:14.932
INVEST IN APPROPRIATE PLACES.

00:42:14.999 --> 00:42:16.166
SO LET'S MAKE SURE THAT THIS

00:42:16.233 --> 00:42:17.635
WORKS.

00:42:17.701 --> 00:42:18.402
OTHERWISE THERE'S GOING TO BE

00:42:18.469 --> 00:42:21.272
THIS LONG PRESSURE ON US TO SAY

00:42:21.338 --> 00:42:22.840
WILL LET US DO THE SAME THING.

00:42:22.907 --> 00:42:24.141
FROM JURISDICTIONS THAT MAY NOT

00:42:24.208 --> 00:42:25.910
BE.

00:42:25.976 --> 00:42:28.112
AS WELL POSITIONED MAY NOT HAVE

00:42:28.178 --> 00:42:30.047
THE RESOURCES MAY NOT REALLY BE

00:42:30.114 --> 00:42:30.948
WILLING.

00:42:31.015 --> 00:42:32.983
THEY'LL TAKE A TOOL AND APPLY IT

00:42:33.050 --> 00:42:35.152
DIFFERENTLY THAN WE WOULD WANT

00:42:35.219 --> 00:42:36.687
TO SEE HAPPEN THAT'S KIND OF

00:42:36.754 --> 00:42:38.022
SOME OF THE DANGER THAT WE'RE

00:42:38.088 --> 00:42:39.957
WORKING WITH HERE.

00:42:40.024 --> 00:42:40.491
THAT'S TO TRUST THAT WERE

AND I DO THINK THIS IS A MODEST

00:46:00.124 --> 00:46:01.959
STEP FORWARD I DO THINK IT IS

00:48:50.694 --> 00:48:52.095
RIGHT THING [inaudible]

00:48:52.162 --> 00:48:53.363
I'M.

00:48:53.430 --> 00:48:54.965
AND I'M I'M REALLY GRATEFUL UP

00:48:55.032 --> 00:48:56.833
TO THE AUTHOR.

00:48:56.900 --> 00:48:58.902
I'D TO WIPE UP CHAIR --

00:48:58.969 --> 00:49:00.270
ON THE AMENDMENTS I THINK AS WE

00:49:00.337 --> 00:49:01.972
HAVE MISTER CHILD THE AMENDMENTS

00:49:02.039 --> 00:49:03.407
GO A LONG WAY --

00:49:03.473 --> 00:49:05.175
IT MAKING IT A MUCH BETTER BILL

00:49:05.242 --> 00:49:06.677
AND I KNOW THAT --

00:49:06.743 --> 00:49:08.278
YOU KNOW THIS IS.

00:49:08.345 --> 00:49:10.547
BUT AGAIN AS OFTEN TIMES THE

00:49:10.614 --> 00:49:12.382
CASE YOU'RE TRYING TO THREATEN

00:49:12.449 --> 00:49:14.451
NEED ALSO AND THIS IS A REALLY

00:49:14.518 --> 00:49:16.219
TOUGH -- ONE

00:49:16.286 --> 00:49:17.854
TEND TO TRY TO RECONCILE --

00:49:17.921 --> 00:49:19.656
MOVED WITH REALLY DIFFICULT

00:49:19.723 --> 00:49:20.557
CHALLENGES HAPPENING IN SO MANY

00:49:20.624 --> 00:49:22.559
CITIES.

00:49:22.626 --> 00:49:24.895
AROUND OUR STATE I'M.

00:49:24.961 --> 00:49:27.864
YOU KNOW THE UP OF THE AND TO

00:49:27.931 --> 00:49:29.433
TOUCH ON SOME OF THE AMENDMENTS

00:49:29.499 --> 00:49:31.468
I THINK OF REALLY REALLY HELPFUL --

00:49:31.535 --> 00:49:33.003
HAVING THAT WORKING GROUP MAKING

00:49:33.070 --> 00:49:34.871
SURE THAT WE HAD ADVOCATES AT

00:49:34.938 --> 00:49:36.473
THE TABLE MAKING SURE.

00:49:36.540 --> 00:49:38.475
THAT EVERYONE --

00:49:38.542 --> 00:49:39.676
CAN REALLY MONITOR THIS.

00:49:39.743 --> 00:49:43.146
VERY CLOSELY IS IS CRITICAL --%

00:49:43.213 --> 00:49:47.384
BECAUSE NUMBER OF I AGREE WITH

00:49:47.451 --> 00:49:49.820
THE OVERALL PLAN WHICH I THINK

00:49:49.886 --> 00:49:50.087
PROBABLY.

00:49:50.153 --> 00:49:52.089
MOST OF US AGREEMENT THAT NOT

00:49:52.155 --> 00:49:52.656
ENOUGH HAS BEEN DONE IN THE

00:49:52.723 --> 00:49:53.590
WHOLE WIDE.

00:49:53.657 --> 00:49:54.958
ON A WHOLE WIDE RANGE OF ISSUES

00:49:55.025 --> 00:49:58.128
THAT HAS LED US. TO WHERE WE ARE --

00:49:58.195 --> 00:49:59.996
IN AT THE END SO IT'S NOT

00:50:00.063 --> 00:50:01.498
SPECIFIC TO JUST HOW WE'RE

00:50:01.565 --> 00:50:02.599
DEALING WITH.

00:50:02.666 --> 00:50:04.368
POST MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES OR

00:50:04.434 --> 00:50:06.303
DRUG ADDICTION I'M A IT'S HOW

00:50:06.370 --> 00:50:07.237
WE'RE DOING WITH POOR PEOPLE

00:50:07.304 --> 00:50:08.472
IT'S OUR DEALING WITH THE INCOME

00:50:08.538 --> 00:50:11.241
INEQUALITY AND INEQUITIES AND I

00:50:11.308 --> 00:50:13.176
KNOW THAT --

00:50:13.243 --> 00:50:14.578
YUP SOUNDS A SAM'S CHO HAU

00:50:14.644 --> 00:50:16.213
COMPOSITION ALL TIME HOW WE CAN

00:50:16.279 --> 00:50:17.347
GET SOME BY NEIGHBORS TO HELP.

00:50:17.414 --> 00:50:18.782
US WITH HOUSING IN AND GET THEM

00:50:18.849 --> 00:50:20.016
TO HELP IN IN DEALING WITH SOME

00:50:20.083 --> 00:50:21.017
OF THE ISSUES THAT.

00:50:21.084 --> 00:50:21.985
ARE SOME OF THE BIGGER CITIES

00:50:22.052 --> 00:50:24.654
ARE JUST REALLY IN A CRISIS MODE --

00:50:24.721 --> 00:50:27.591
TRYING TO DEAL WITH --

00:50:27.657 --> 00:50:31.895
AND THAT THAT ONE OF THE OTHER

00:50:31.962 --> 00:50:32.195
[inaudible]

00:50:32.262 --> 00:50:35.532
THE THE AREAS I THINK THAT YOU

00:50:35.599 --> 00:50:37.267
KNOW.

00:50:37.334 --> 00:50:39.302
EIGHT HAVING A PRETTY ONE FIFTY

00:50:39.369 --> 00:50:41.605
HOLDS IN IN TWELVE MONTHS A LOT.

00:50:41.671 --> 00:50:43.473
I I CAN THAT REALLY SPEAKS.

00:50:43.540 --> 00:50:44.207
TO AND THE DEGREE TO WHICH

00:50:44.274 --> 00:50:46.076
SOMEONE IS REALLY.

00:50:46.143 --> 00:50:48.712
STRUGGLING TO SURVIVE

00:50:48.779 --> 00:50:49.012
[inaudible]

00:50:49.079 --> 00:50:53.150
AND I DO BELIEVE THAT.

00:50:53.216 --> 00:50:54.951
YOU KNOW THAT THAT THE FACT THAT

00:50:55.018 --> 00:50:57.654
THIS IS OF ALL LIMITED --

00:50:57.721 --> 00:50:59.723
FIVE YEAR OF THE PILOT IS A GOOD

00:50:59.790 --> 00:51:03.460
THING BUT BECAUSE I WOULD HOPE

00:51:03.527 --> 00:51:04.561
THAT IT WOULDN'T BE NEEDED AFTER

00:51:04.628 --> 00:51:06.196
FIVE YEARS.

00:51:06.263 --> 00:51:07.497
THE OTHERS BECAUSE A SUBSET OF

00:51:07.564 --> 00:51:08.999
FOLKS THAT.

00:51:09.065 --> 00:51:09.966
ARE HOMELESS THAT ARE STRUGGLING

00:51:10.033 --> 00:51:11.435
THAT.

00:51:11.501 --> 00:51:12.803
IF IN THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS IF

00:51:12.869 --> 00:51:14.070
WE CAN REALLY GET.

00:51:14.137 --> 00:51:15.772
THE BULK OF THEM OFF THE STREET

00:51:15.839 --> 00:51:16.940
AND GET THEM THE HELP THEY NEED.

00:51:17.007 --> 00:51:18.508
THAT.

00:51:18.575 --> 00:51:19.876
BUT THIS KIND OF PROGRAM

00:51:19.943 --> 00:51:20.811
WOULDN'T BE NECESSARY BECAUSE WE

00:51:20.877 --> 00:51:22.846
CAN REDUCE.

00:51:22.913 --> 00:51:24.347
THE NUMBERS AND THE AND I WILL

00:51:24.414 --> 00:51:26.883
NOT REALLY BE KEEN ON LOOKING AT

00:51:26.950 --> 00:51:28.485
THE DATA --

00:51:28.552 --> 00:51:30.220
FROM SAM CISCO.

00:51:30.287 --> 00:51:31.788
I'VE AND A TO SEE WHAT THE END

00:51:31.855 --> 00:51:33.690
RESULT IS.

00:51:33.757 --> 00:51:35.625
IS THIS SOMEONE THAT.

00:51:35.692 --> 00:51:36.693
RIGHT IS ADAPTED PUBLIC DEFENDER

00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:38.628
FROM ELEVEN YEARS SPENDING HALF

00:51:38.695 --> 00:51:40.363
THAT TIME OFTEN ON IN DRUG

00:51:40.430 --> 00:51:41.765
TREATMENT COURT.

00:51:41.832 --> 00:51:44.401
OF I HAVE A VISCERAL REACTION TO

00:51:44.468 --> 00:51:47.437
ANY KIND INVOLUNTARY ATTENTION

00:51:47.504 --> 00:51:47.737
[inaudible]

00:51:47.804 --> 00:51:52.275
AND AT THE SAME TIME AS AS SAM

00:51:52.342 --> 00:51:54.678
MISS CUNNINGHAM OF THEM SPOKE OF

00:51:54.744 --> 00:51:56.379
HER ARE MANY OCCASIONS.

00:51:56.446 --> 00:51:58.215
WHERE A HEARTBREAKING OCCASIONS

00:51:58.281 --> 00:51:59.549
WHERE I WANTED TO DO MORE AND I

00:51:59.616 --> 00:52:02.152
COULDN'T --

00:52:02.219 --> 00:52:04.855
AND I HAD.

00:52:04.921 --> 00:52:07.224
MANY CLIENTS DIE.

00:52:07.290 --> 00:52:08.058
THAT MEANS.

00:52:08.124 --> 00:52:09.359
THAT WHERE ARE THEY PASSED OUT

00:52:09.426 --> 00:52:11.127
OPEN CASES AND WE CLOSE THEM

00:52:11.194 --> 00:52:14.464
BECAUSE OF THEIR DEATH --

00:52:14.531 --> 00:52:16.700
BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT.

00:52:16.766 --> 00:52:18.001
WE DON'T TAKE THEIR LIBERTY

00:52:18.068 --> 00:52:20.170
SERIOUSLY --

00:52:20.237 --> 00:52:23.507
BUT GUARD LISTA BUT IT IS GOING

00:52:23.573 --> 00:52:27.677
ON IN THEIR LIFE. ONE OF THE

00:52:27.744 --> 00:52:29.679
WORRIES THAT I HAVE THAT ARE

00:52:29.746 --> 00:52:32.282
CHAIR OF ALLUDED [inaudible]

00:52:32.349 --> 00:52:34.417
TO IS.

00:52:34.484 --> 00:52:36.553
A TOOL AND AND FRANKLY YOU KNOW

00:52:36.620 --> 00:52:38.154
SAM SAYS GO AT A PARTICULARLY

00:52:38.221 --> 00:52:39.990
HAVING OUR MARILLAC SUPERVISOR

00:52:40.056 --> 00:52:41.791
LIKE HERE WITH OUR SENATOR.

00:52:41.858 --> 00:52:43.126
BUT WITH OUR SUMMIT AND BY THE

00:52:43.193 --> 00:52:44.828
WAY -- AS

00:52:44.895 --> 00:52:47.063
WAS FOR A FROM A WESTERN CENTER

00:52:47.130 --> 00:52:47.898
SAID THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS

00:52:47.964 --> 00:52:49.099
THE STATE NEEDS TO DO THAT WE

00:52:49.165 --> 00:52:50.867
CAN'T GET ACROSS THE FINISH LINE.

00:52:50.934 --> 00:52:53.036
BASS NOT THE FAULT OF ANYONE

00:52:53.103 --> 00:52:54.404
THAT REPRESENTS SAN FRANCISCO.

00:52:54.471 --> 00:52:56.606
AND IN MOST CASES THEY THE STATE

00:52:56.673 --> 00:52:57.841
REPRESENTATIVES FROM SAM SAW

00:52:57.908 --> 00:52:59.576
ONES ARE TRYING TO PUSH --

00:52:59.643 --> 00:53:00.977
ON ON STATEWIDE FIXES THAT WE

00:53:01.044 --> 00:53:01.945
JUST CAN'T.

00:53:02.012 --> 00:53:03.346
GET DONE BECAUSE OF REPRESENT

00:53:03.413 --> 00:53:06.349
OTHER BECAUSE JIM WE CAN GET

00:53:06.416 --> 00:53:06.917
DONE.

00:53:06.983 --> 00:53:08.852
AND IT'S NOT IT'S NOT THE FAULT

00:53:08.919 --> 00:53:11.054
OF OF THOSE THAT REPRESENT

00:53:11.121 --> 00:53:12.389
SAMPRAS'S GO THAT'S FOR SURE --

00:53:12.455 --> 00:53:16.293
BUT IT I HAVE SEEN IN SOUNDS AND

00:53:16.359 --> 00:53:18.161
SOUND GREAT COUNTY SWEEPS THAT

00:53:18.228 --> 00:53:20.564
DON'T ACCOMPLISH ANYTHING.

00:53:20.630 --> 00:53:22.866
I OF AND AUTHORITY TO DO SWEEPS

00:53:22.933 --> 00:53:27.804
THAT DON'T SOLVE THE PROBLEM --

00:53:27.871 --> 00:53:29.606
I'M WORRIED THAT THIS TOOL WILL

00:53:29.673 --> 00:53:32.108
BE USED AS A WEAPON --

00:53:32.175 --> 00:53:33.276
AND THAT'S WHY THE OVERSIGHT IS

00:53:33.343 --> 00:53:35.078
SO CRITICAL.

00:53:35.145 --> 00:53:36.146
A BETTER DOES TROUBLE ME THAT NO

00:53:36.212 --> 00:53:40.517
ONE'S HERE FROM LA --

00:53:40.584 --> 00:53:43.219
IT WOULD BE NICE TO HEAR BUT

00:53:43.286 --> 00:53:43.820
THAT THEIR COMMITMENT TO MAKE

00:53:43.887 --> 00:53:45.288
SURE [inaudible]

00:53:45.355 --> 00:53:47.190
THAT -- BUT

00:53:47.257 --> 00:53:49.326
THERE GONNA UPHOLD THE RIGHTS.

00:53:49.392 --> 00:53:50.794
BUT OF THESE INDIVIDUALS WERE ON

00:53:50.860 --> 00:53:51.828
THEIR STREETS WE KNOW LA HAS ONE

00:53:51.895 --> 00:53:53.763
OF THE HAS THE WORST.

00:53:53.830 --> 00:53:54.397
HOMELESSNESS PROBLEM THAN IN THE

00:53:54.464 --> 00:53:55.865
NATION.

00:53:55.932 --> 00:53:57.300
SO I. DEATHLY --

00:53:57.367 --> 00:53:57.867
WANT TO DO WHATEVER I CAN TO

00:53:57.934 --> 00:53:59.069
HELP THEM.

00:53:59.135 --> 00:54:01.004
BUT THEY HAVE TO GO.

00:54:01.071 --> 00:54:02.739
AND I DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW

00:54:02.806 --> 00:54:04.174
WHY I KNOW THE FOLKS THAT ARE IS

00:54:04.240 --> 00:54:06.042
SENSES GO THAT AND THE WORK THAT

00:54:06.109 --> 00:54:07.010
THEY'RE TRYING TO DO.

00:54:07.077 --> 00:54:09.713
I'M I DON'T KNOW WHO'S GOING TO

00:54:09.779 --> 00:54:11.348
BE OVERSEEING THE PROGRAM.

00:54:11.414 --> 00:54:13.717
AND THE IT AND IS IT GOING TO BE

00:54:13.783 --> 00:54:15.518
USED AS A WEAPON.

00:54:15.585 --> 00:54:16.886
I IT WAS JUST ABSENCE GOD I I'D

00:54:16.953 --> 00:54:18.922
I'D FEEL FAR MORE ACCOUNTABLE TO

00:54:18.989 --> 00:54:19.356
SING LOOKING TO LET.

00:54:19.422 --> 00:54:20.590
THAT.

00:54:20.657 --> 00:54:22.626
THESE NOBLE COLLECTORS DO WHAT

00:54:22.692 --> 00:54:24.160
THEY CAN AT THE CITY LEVEL.

00:54:24.227 --> 00:54:26.096
UMMM I KNOW THE TRAUMA BEING

00:54:26.162 --> 00:54:28.131
BECAUSE NOW LAKE IS IS FAR.

00:54:28.198 --> 00:54:29.766
GREATER THAN TOO MUCH ANYWHERE

00:54:29.833 --> 00:54:30.734
ELSE IN THE NATION.

00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:31.968
UMF GREATER THAN IT IS A SAN

00:54:32.035 --> 00:54:33.236
JOSE -- AND

00:54:33.303 --> 00:54:34.638
MANY OTHER PLACES --

00:54:34.704 --> 00:54:36.439
BUT I THINK THAT'S THE ONE AREA

00:54:36.506 --> 00:54:38.208
AT THAT LED.

00:54:38.274 --> 00:54:40.910
CHAU IS THE MOST IS HOW IS THIS.

00:54:40.977 --> 00:54:43.079
TOOL GOING TO BE USED --

00:54:43.146 --> 00:54:44.614
BUT I DO BELIEVE AS WAS

00:54:44.681 --> 00:54:45.949
MENTIONED THAT THE AMENDMENTS GO

00:54:46.016 --> 00:54:48.251
A VERY LONG WAY --

00:54:48.318 --> 00:54:49.953
TO PUT ENOUGH PARAMETERS AND

00:54:50.020 --> 00:54:52.522
PROTECTIONS OF THESE INDIVIDUALS --

00:54:52.589 --> 00:54:55.325
AND THAT I AM CONFIDENT THAT OF

00:54:55.392 --> 00:54:55.959
THE SAN FRANCISCO WILL BE ABLE

00:54:56.026 --> 00:54:56.693
TO ADD.

00:54:56.760 --> 00:54:59.329
A MEASURE IT AND AND BRING ALL

00:54:59.396 --> 00:55:00.964
THE HAPPIEST TOGETHER BOTTOM.

00:55:01.031 --> 00:55:02.232
ALTHOUGH THE MAJOR PROBLEMS

00:55:02.298 --> 00:55:03.533
THERE'S AREN'T ENOUGH BEDS

00:55:03.600 --> 00:55:05.168
THERE'S ON OF HOUSING AND SO

00:55:05.235 --> 00:55:06.503
EVEN IF YOU CONSERVE SOMEONE

00:55:06.569 --> 00:55:07.904
BREAKING UP ITEM.

00:55:07.971 --> 00:55:08.872
I WHICH IS ONE OF THE ISSUES

00:55:08.938 --> 00:55:10.140
THAT I'VE HAD WITH THAT WITH

00:55:10.206 --> 00:55:12.942
SWEEPS IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY --

00:55:13.009 --> 00:55:13.877
IS THAT THEY SLEEP FOLKS AND

00:55:13.943 --> 00:55:15.512
THEN THEY JUST.

00:55:15.578 --> 00:55:16.780
THEIR BY OTHER BACK THERE OR

00:55:16.846 --> 00:55:18.415
THEY'RE IN ANOTHER NEIGHBORHOOD.

00:55:18.481 --> 00:55:21.351
I'M YOU KNOW A COUPLE DAYS LATER.

ACCENT --

00:57:32.148 --> 00:57:33.783
AND IT IT WAS DIFFICULT WAS

00:57:33.850 --> 00:57:34.984
DIFFICULT GETTING THEM AND

00:57:35.051 --> 00:57:35.819
HOUSING SERVICES BY THE WAY WE

00:57:35.885 --> 00:57:39.923
GOT A MALL AND BUT I FELT FROM

00:57:39.989 --> 00:57:41.724
COME FROM SPENDING ALL THOSE

00:57:41.791 --> 00:57:43.960
YEARS CHINA FROM GOING OUT ON

00:57:44.027 --> 00:57:44.460
THE STREET.

00:57:44.527 --> 00:57:47.096
MYSELF NOT SEEN IN AN OFFICE

00:57:47.163 --> 00:57:47.697
TALKING ABOUT UP A GLANCE YOU

00:57:47.764 --> 00:57:49.232
MYSELF.

00:57:49.299 --> 00:57:50.900
AND TALKING TO THESE HOMELESS

00:57:50.967 --> 00:57:53.603
INDIVIDUALS TRYING TO PERSUADE

00:57:53.670 --> 00:57:55.405
THEM TO COME IN AND GET SERVICES

00:57:55.471 --> 00:57:57.140
AND GET HOUSING.

00:57:57.207 --> 00:57:59.008
IT WAS AN UNBELIEVABLY DIFFICULT

00:57:59.075 --> 00:58:03.146
TASK BECAUSE AS AS YOU'D SAID

00:58:03.213 --> 00:58:05.248
HOW MARILYN.

00:58:05.315 --> 00:58:07.016
SOME DAYS WERE REALLY GOOD DAYS.

00:58:07.083 --> 00:58:09.018
AND WE HAVE THESE RATIONAL.

00:58:09.085 --> 00:58:10.954
RELATIVELY RATIONAL IS SORT OF

00:58:11.020 --> 00:58:12.422
FOR REMOVING DISCUSSIONS AND

00:58:12.488 --> 00:58:13.656
THEN THE NEXT DAY WOULD BE

00:58:13.723 --> 00:58:15.391
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT NUMBER.

00:58:15.458 --> 00:58:16.426
ONE THAT --

00:58:16.492 --> 00:58:17.660
WHAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON FOR

00:58:17.727 --> 00:58:19.062
ALMOST A YEAR?

00:58:19.128 --> 00:58:21.030
AND AMERICAN BACK IN AND HE HE

00:58:21.097 --> 00:58:21.798
DIDN'T RECOGNIZE ME NURSING YOU

00:58:21.865 --> 00:58:24.868
NOT IT'S BEEN A YEAR OF THIS --

00:58:24.934 --> 00:58:26.936
AND DIDN'T KNOW WHO I WAS.

00:58:27.003 --> 00:58:28.771
AND IT YOU KNOW IT SHAKES UP A

00:58:28.838 --> 00:58:29.706
LITTLE BIT YOU KNOW AND IT

00:58:29.772 --> 00:58:31.040
REALLY MAKES YOU REALIZE THE

00:58:31.107 --> 00:58:32.909
LEVEL OF STRUGGLE THAT WE ALL

00:58:32.976 --> 00:58:34.444
ARE GOING TO HAVE IN OUR OWN

00:58:34.510 --> 00:58:36.546
JURISDICTIONS IN OUR OWN CITIES.

00:58:36.613 --> 00:58:38.915
AND COUNTIES ON THIS TOPIC I

00:58:38.982 --> 00:58:41.951
CAME TO THE CONCLUSION FROM THAT --

00:58:42.018 --> 00:58:44.587
THAT I THOUGHT --

00:58:44.654 --> 00:58:45.822
PROVIDING CONSERVATIVE FOR THOSE

00:58:45.889 --> 00:58:47.924
INDIVIDUALS WAS A MORE HUMANE

00:58:47.991 --> 00:58:50.059
APPROACH THAT THAT BECAME MY

00:58:50.126 --> 00:58:50.593
OPINION AND I GET WHY SOME

00:58:50.660 --> 00:58:52.462
PEOPLE.

00:58:52.528 --> 00:58:54.664
MAY NOT ALWAYS SHARE BUT I FELT

00:58:54.731 --> 00:58:56.499
LIKE THE ONLY WAY WE COULD.

00:58:56.566 --> 00:58:57.567
AND WAS IT AND BY THE WAY IT WAS

00:58:57.634 --> 00:58:58.968
THE ONLY TIME IN SAN DIEGO'S

00:58:59.035 --> 00:59:00.470
HISTORY AT LEAST WE HAVE

00:59:00.536 --> 00:59:02.238
SUCCESSFUL HOMELESS PROGRAM.

00:59:02.305 --> 00:59:03.373
AND WAS THAT NOW GRANTED AND

00:59:03.439 --> 00:59:04.307
THAT WAS WHAT BY THE WAY THAT

00:59:04.374 --> 00:59:05.408
WAS WITHOUT THAT.

00:59:05.475 --> 00:59:07.076
BUT I THOUGHT.

00:59:07.143 --> 00:59:08.711
BECAUSE WE WE WE DIDN'T END UP

00:59:08.778 --> 00:59:09.913
HAVING TO USE A CONSERVER SHIPS

00:59:09.979 --> 00:59:10.947
BUT I THOUGHT THE ONLY WAY

00:59:11.014 --> 00:59:13.149
REALLY TO GET PAST. FOR THE

00:59:13.216 --> 00:59:14.317
NUMBER I DON'T HATE.

00:59:14.384 --> 00:59:15.885
AND GET TARA THREE HUNDRED

00:59:15.952 --> 00:59:17.153
EIGHTY EIGHT WHEN. FIVE HUNDRED

00:59:17.220 --> 00:59:22.058
AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO AT SOME

00:59:22.125 --> 00:59:23.326
POINT START MAKING USE SIR

00:59:23.393 --> 00:59:24.527
MAKING A BETTER USE OF THE

00:59:24.594 --> 00:59:25.561
CONSERVATORSHIP SYSTEM THAT

00:59:25.628 --> 00:59:28.131
