00:36:53.277 --> 00:36:55.279

00:37:04.922 --> 00:37:06.724
SUGGESTING THAT THE BUDGET MAY

00:37:06.791 --> 00:37:08.726
BE FACING SOME DOWNSIDE RISK

00:37:08.793 --> 00:37:11.295
GOING FORWARD- GIVEN THESE

00:37:11.362 --> 00:37:13.431

LEGISLATURE THAT RESERVES WILL

00:37:14.599 --> 00:37:16.734
BE ESSENTIAL. TO THE STATE AND

00:37:22.306 --> 00:37:23.908
MOVE THROUGH OUR COMMENTS ON A

00:37:23.975 --> 00:37:26.010
NUMBER OF THE ITEMS POSE HERE

00:37:26.077 --> 00:37:27.812
STARTING WITH OF THE CANNABIS

00:37:27.878 --> 00:37:29.614
PROPOSALS- WE THINK THE

00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:33.150
PROPOSALS TO MOVE- THE RETAIL

00:37:33.217 --> 00:37:34.986
EXCISE POINT OF COLLECTION AND

00:37:35.052 --> 00:37:36.020
TO ELIMINATE THE CULTIVATION

00:37:36.087 --> 00:37:40.825
TAX- MATCH RECOMMENDATIONS.

00:37:40.891 --> 00:37:41.692
WE'VE PREVIOUSLY MADE IN OUR

00:37:41.759 --> 00:37:42.526
TWENTY NINETEEN REPORT- THE PER.

00:37:42.593 --> 00:37:43.594
RATE CHANGE FOR THE RETAIL

00:37:43.661 --> 00:37:45.363
EXCISE TAX IS PERHAPS MORE

00:37:45.429 --> 00:37:46.864
COMPLEX THAN WOULD BE IDEAL-

00:37:46.931 --> 00:37:49.000
THAT BEING SAID WE- WE RECOGNIZE

00:37:49.066 --> 00:37:50.368
THAT THE PROPOSAL'S KALU TRYING

00:37:50.434 --> 00:37:53.270
TO STRIKE A BALANCE BETWEEN-

00:37:53.337 --> 00:37:54.905

00:38:09.987 --> 00:38:11.455
REASONABLE GIVEN THE SCALE OF

00:38:11.522 --> 00:38:12.456
THE CHALLENGES FACED BY THE

00:38:12.523 --> 00:38:14.558

THE NEW AND EXPANDED PROGRAMS

00:38:24.368 --> 00:38:25.503

FORTH- IN ADDITION THE MAY

00:38:27.538 --> 00:38:29.740

HOMELESSNESS OVER MULTIPLE

YEARS- UNDER THE CONSIDERATION

00:38:36.013 --> 00:38:37.515
OF SOME OF THE ISSUES

00:38:37.581 --> 00:38:37.982
SURROUNDING THE STATE

00:38:38.049 --> 00:38:39.016
APPROPRIATIONS ON THE

00:38:39.083 --> 00:38:39.984
LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT TO

00:38:40.051 --> 00:38:42.353
CONSIDER APPROPRIATING. ALL OF

00:38:42.420 --> 00:38:44.689
THE FUNDING THIS YEAR A TO BE

00:38:44.755 --> 00:38:46.624
DISPERSED OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS

00:38:46.691 --> 00:38:47.925
AND THIS WOULD HAVE THE

00:38:47.992 --> 00:38:48.926
ADVANTAGE. OF ALLOWING THE

00:38:48.993 --> 00:38:51.162
LEGISLATURE TO WEIGH IN NOW ON

00:38:51.228 --> 00:38:52.897
AN AMOUNT OF MONEY TO GO TO

00:38:52.963 --> 00:38:54.098
HOUSING- AND SPREADING THAT

00:38:54.165 --> 00:38:56.400
BENEFIT OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS-

00:38:56.467 --> 00:38:57.902
MORE OVER AN ADDITIONAL BENEFIT

00:38:57.968 --> 00:38:59.336
THAT COULD BE GAINED FROM THAT

00:38:59.403 --> 00:39:01.472
IS AS WE MENTIONED- IF IN FACT

00:39:01.539 --> 00:39:03.441
THE STATE DOES. START TO SEE

00:39:03.507 --> 00:39:05.109
SOME ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN IN FUTURE

00:39:05.176 --> 00:39:06.877
YEARS IT IT COULD GAIN SOME

00:39:06.944 --> 00:39:08.579
BENEFIT AND HAVING ADDITIONAL

00:39:08.646 --> 00:39:09.313
INFRASTRUCTURE DOLLARS GOING

00:39:09.380 --> 00:39:12.717
INTO THE ECONOMY. IN THOSE IN

00:39:12.783 --> 00:39:15.119
THE FUTURE TIME PERIOD. ON A

00:39:15.186 --> 00:39:17.321
BROAD BAND- WE KNOW THAT THE

00:39:17.388 --> 00:39:19.256
BUDGET YEAR. THERE'S NO

00:39:19.323 --> 00:39:21.325
APPROPRIATION IN THE BUDGET YEAR

00:39:21.392 --> 00:39:22.593
AND THERE'S NO ABOUT YOUR BILL

00:39:22.660 --> 00:39:24.695
OR OVER LANGUAGE THAT CODIFIES.

00:39:24.762 --> 00:39:26.130
THE OUT YOUR ALLOCATIONS THAT

00:39:26.197 --> 00:39:27.631
ARE PROPOSED. UNDER THE MAY

00:39:27.698 --> 00:39:30.701
REVISION- IN ADDITION THERE ARE

00:39:30.768 --> 00:39:32.436
OTHERS ANTICIPATED FEDERAL FUNDS

00:39:32.503 --> 00:39:34.605
COMING TO THE STATE IN TWENTY

00:39:34.672 --> 00:39:35.673
THREE TWENTY FOUR AND TWENTY

00:39:35.740 --> 00:39:36.841
FOUR TWENTY FIVE IN THE

00:39:36.907 --> 00:39:38.142
ADMINISTRATION HAS MADE. SOME

00:39:38.209 --> 00:39:40.778
ALLOWANCES FOR THOSE FUNDS TO

00:39:40.845 --> 00:39:41.746
FLOW INTO THE STATE'S EFFORTS IN

00:39:41.812 --> 00:39:43.447
THIS AREA. ON GIVEN THESE

00:39:43.514 --> 00:39:44.849
FACTORS WE THINK THE LEGISLATURE

00:39:44.915 --> 00:39:47.685
COULD- THE LADY MAKING ANY

00:39:47.752 --> 00:39:48.385
DECISIONS ON THESE

00:39:48.452 --> 00:39:51.655
APPROPRIATIONS- OR UNTIL NEXT

00:39:51.722 --> 00:39:55.025
YEAR. ON THE TAX BILL

00:39:55.092 --> 00:39:57.094
FLEXIBILITY- WE THINK THAT THE

00:39:57.161 --> 00:39:59.797
CONCEPT- DOES HAVE SOME MERIT-

00:39:59.864 --> 00:40:03.267
BUT WE FEEL THAT THE PERHAPS-

00:40:03.334 --> 00:40:05.436
LIKELY MODEST BENEFITS THE MOST

00:40:05.503 --> 00:40:08.172
TAXPAYERS- I CANNOT JUSTIFY THE

00:40:08.239 --> 00:40:10.007
RELATIVELY HIGH COSTS OF

00:40:10.074 --> 00:40:10.941
ADMINISTERING THE PROGRAM IS

00:40:11.008 --> 00:40:15.079
ESTIMATED. BY THE ADMINISTRATION

00:40:15.146 --> 00:40:16.614
. ON E. I. T. C. OUT REACH

00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:19.183
THERE'S A NUMBER OF PROPOSED OUT

00:40:19.250 --> 00:40:22.386
REACH EFFORTS- WE HAVE CONCERNS

00:40:22.453 --> 00:40:24.889
ABOUT- ONE PROPOSAL FOR FTV TO

00:40:24.955 --> 00:40:26.323
PROACTIVELY REACH OUT TO

00:40:26.390 --> 00:40:28.425
HOUSEHOLDS WHO MAY BE ELIGIBLE

00:40:28.492 --> 00:40:29.460
FOR YET YOU SEE BUT DID NOT

00:40:29.527 --> 00:40:31.529
CLAIM IT. AND WHILE THIS SEEMS

00:40:31.595 --> 00:40:32.563
LIKE IT COULD BE A REASONABLE

00:40:32.630 --> 00:40:34.732
PROPOSED- BASED ON PREVIOUS

00:40:34.799 --> 00:40:38.569
ATTEMPTS TO MAKE SIMILAR EFFORTS

00:40:38.636 --> 00:40:39.737
WE THINK IT'S LIKELY TO BE AN

00:40:39.804 --> 00:40:43.774
EFFECTIVE. ON THE PROPOSALS

00:40:43.841 --> 00:40:45.943
WITHIN GOBIZ TO PROVIDE

00:40:46.010 --> 00:40:47.378
ADDITIONAL RELIEF GRANTS TO

00:40:47.444 --> 00:40:53.784
BUSINESSES- THE STATE HAS MADE A

00:40:53.851 --> 00:40:55.052
CAN'T RELIEF GRANTS TO SMALL

00:40:55.119 --> 00:40:56.353
BUSINESSES FOLLOWING AN APPROACH

00:40:56.420 --> 00:40:58.522
THAT PRIORITIZE. RAPID

00:40:58.589 --> 00:41:00.758
DISBURSEMENT OF ASSISTANCE TO

00:41:00.825 --> 00:41:01.625
BUSINESSES AND WE THINK THAT

00:41:01.692 --> 00:41:03.794
THAT WAS  WARRANTED AS A

00:41:03.861 --> 00:41:05.396
PRIORITY DURING THE HEIGHT OF

00:41:05.462 --> 00:41:08.065
THE PANDEMIC BUT- THAT APPROACH

00:41:08.132 --> 00:41:10.434
DID MAKE SOME TRADE OFFS IN THE

00:41:10.501 --> 00:41:11.702
YEARS OF TRANSPARENCY AND

00:41:11.769 --> 00:41:12.803
OVERSIGHT AND EFFECTIVE

00:41:12.870 --> 00:41:14.338
TARGETING AND WE THINK THAT

00:41:14.405 --> 00:41:16.040
APPROACH IS NO LONGER WARRANTED

00:41:16.106 --> 00:41:18.442
NOW THAT THE ECONOMY. HAS

00:41:18.509 --> 00:41:20.411
RECOVERED FROM THE DEPTHS OF THE

00:41:20.477 --> 00:41:23.147
PANDEMIC AND SWEET- I. REJECTING

00:41:23.214 --> 00:41:25.015
ALLOCATING FIVE HUNDRED MILLION

00:41:25.082 --> 00:41:27.117
FOR THE NEW HARD HIT INDUSTRIES

00:41:27.184 --> 00:41:31.288
GRANT PROGRAM SIMILARLY ON THE-

00:41:31.355 --> 00:41:35.860
RELIEF GRANTS- FOR AT DROUGHT-

00:41:35.926 --> 00:41:40.931
WE HAVE A SIMILAR CONCERN- THE

00:41:40.998 --> 00:41:43.467
PROPOSALS TO FOLLOW AGAIN A AND

00:41:43.534 --> 00:41:46.036
AN EMERGENCY MODEL THAT APPROACH

00:41:46.103 --> 00:41:46.570
IS GETTING THE FUNDING OUT

00:41:46.637 --> 00:41:49.506
RAPIDLY. AND GIVEN THAT DROUGHT

00:41:49.573 --> 00:41:50.875
IS A LONG STANDING PROBLEM FOR

00:41:50.941 --> 00:41:52.743
THE STATE WILL CONTINUE TO BE A

00:41:52.810 --> 00:41:54.011
PROBLEM GOING FORWARD WE DON'T

00:41:54.078 --> 00:41:55.913
THINK THAT THAT KIND OF- THAT

00:41:55.980 --> 00:41:57.448
THAT APPROACH THAT PRIORITIZES

00:41:57.514 --> 00:41:58.916
RAPID DISBURSEMENT OVER THESE

00:41:58.983 --> 00:42:02.319
OTHER FACTORS IS APPROPRIATE AS

00:42:02.386 --> 00:42:03.420
AN APPROPRIATE MODEL FOR THAT

00:42:03.487 --> 00:42:06.290
FUNDING. ALL ON THE O. D. I.

00:42:06.357 --> 00:42:07.324
PROPOSAL WERE STILL REVIEWING

00:42:07.391 --> 00:42:08.926
THE PROPOSAL- IT GENERALLY

00:42:08.993 --> 00:42:10.327
APPEARS REASONABLE GIVEN THE

00:42:10.394 --> 00:42:11.962
OVERLAP. IN ADMINISTRATIVE AND

00:42:12.029 --> 00:42:14.131
PROGRAMMATIC RESPONSIBILITIES OF

00:42:14.198 --> 00:42:14.865
THESE ENTITIES WITH THEN GOV

00:42:14.932 --> 00:42:16.934
OPS. WE THINK THERE ARE SOME

00:42:17.001 --> 00:42:19.336
ELEMENTS THAT COULD BE CLARIFIED

00:42:19.403 --> 00:42:21.839
IN TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. AND

THE STATE. SO THIS IS ANOTHER

00:53:26.670 --> 00:53:28.805
IMPORTANT SOLUTION ONE WHERE AS

SIMPLIFY THE TAX STRUCTURE TO

01:00:17.347 --> 01:00:19.449
MAKE IT EASIER FOR TAXPAYERS-

MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN- WORK MOST

01:00:35.565 --> 01:00:39.469
EFFECTIVELY TO- ADDRESSED THE

01:00:39.535 --> 01:00:41.838
ARE VERY SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM OF

01:00:41.904 --> 01:00:44.574
THE ILLEGAL MARKET- THAT WE FIND

01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:47.777
ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

01:00:47.844 --> 01:00:50.546
AND SO- THE PROPOSAL WOULD MOVE

01:00:50.613 --> 01:00:54.384
THE EXCISE TAX WHICH IS THE 15%

01:00:54.450 --> 01:00:58.554
TAX- FROM THE DISTRIBUTOR TO THE

01:00:58.621 --> 01:01:01.724
RETAILER WHICH IS- THE WAY THE

01:01:01.791 --> 01:01:04.460
TAX WAS STRUCTURED IN PROP SIXTY

01:01:04.527 --> 01:01:08.264
FOUR- THAT WOULD HAVE A NUMBER

01:01:08.331 --> 01:01:09.799
OF BENEFITS- FIRST IT WOULD

01:01:09.866 --> 01:01:11.534
ALIGN BETTER LINE THE TAX WITH.

01:01:11.601 --> 01:01:13.369
PROP SIXTY FOUR IT WOULD

01:01:13.436 --> 01:01:15.505
ELIMINATE THIS- SITUATION WE

01:01:15.571 --> 01:01:17.874
HAVE CURRENTLY WHERE WE- COME UP

01:01:17.940 --> 01:01:20.376
WITH IT- AVERAGE STATEWIDE

01:01:20.443 --> 01:01:25.081
MARKUP RATE. TWICE A YEAR- THAT

01:01:25.148 --> 01:01:26.816
RESULTS FRANKLY IN WILDLY

01:01:26.883 --> 01:01:29.052
VARYING TAX RATES- FOR VARIOUS

01:01:29.118 --> 01:01:30.586
PARTS OF THE STATE AND IT'S VERY

01:01:30.653 --> 01:01:33.156
CONFUSING- TO CONSUMERS AND

01:01:33.222 --> 01:01:35.958
RETAILERS- WE BELIEVE THAT WOULD

01:01:36.025 --> 01:01:38.061
RESULT IN BY MANY FEWER

01:01:38.127 --> 01:01:39.729
REPORTING ERRORS ON OUR RETURNS-

01:01:39.796 --> 01:01:41.264

01:01:41.330 --> 01:01:42.331

STRAIGHTFORWARD- AS WELL AS

01:01:44.467 --> 01:01:46.769
ALLOW US TO. LEVERAGE OUR VERY

01:01:46.836 --> 01:01:50.406
LARGE SALES AND USE TAX- JEAN TO

01:01:50.473 --> 01:01:52.842
ALSO TRY TO ADDRESS THE-

01:01:52.909 --> 01:01:53.876
PROBLEMS IN THE CAMPUS MARKET

01:01:53.943 --> 01:01:56.245
SINCE. THE CANNABIS RETAILERS

01:01:56.312 --> 01:01:57.780
ARE SALES AND USE TAX PAYERS SO

01:01:57.847 --> 01:02:00.550
WE'RE ALREADY WORKING WITH THEM

01:02:00.616 --> 01:02:03.019
ON SALES AND USE- AND

01:02:03.086 --> 01:02:05.021
FURTHERMORE IT- THE MOVE MOVING

01:02:05.088 --> 01:02:08.624
THIS TO THE POINT OF SALE- WOULD

01:02:08.691 --> 01:02:12.261
ELIMINATE A LOT OF THE DISPUTES

01:02:12.328 --> 01:02:14.597
THAT WE'RE- IN BETWEEN. JUST AND

01:02:14.664 --> 01:02:17.733

THE TAXES AND- WHETHER OR NOT

01:02:20.203 --> 01:02:22.271
THE DISTRIBUTORS HAVE BEEN-

01:02:22.338 --> 01:02:24.173
GIVEN THE MONEY FOR THE TAXES

01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:26.909
AND WOOD- I BELIEVE THAT THIS

01:02:26.976 --> 01:02:28.945
REALLY STREAMLINED THE THIS

01:02:29.011 --> 01:02:30.213
SITUATION FOR US IN THE

01:02:30.279 --> 01:02:31.547
ENFORCEMENT PIECES ARE EQUALLY

01:02:31.614 --> 01:02:33.616

HAPPILY I INCLUDE DATES ON THIS

01:05:30.593 --> 01:05:32.561

HARVESTING AND THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:06:13.769 --> 01:06:17.206
FINANCE THE 19% IS REFLECTIVE OF

01:06:17.273 --> 01:06:19.442
WHAT THE TAX RATE IS NOW BECAUSE

01:06:19.508 --> 01:06:21.777
THE TAX RATE IS CURRENTLY. ABOUT

PROGRAM THE HARD HIT INDUSTRIES.

01:09:53.589 --> 01:09:54.790
THE WAY WE WOULD ENSURE THAT

01:09:54.857 --> 01:09:57.426
EQUITY AND INCLUSION IT IS BIG

01:09:57.493 --> 01:09:58.861
TEN YEARS WE WOULD LEVERAGE THE

01:09:58.928 --> 01:10:01.463
COBIT RELIEF GRANT PROGRAMS

01:10:01.530 --> 01:10:03.432

PROVIDERS- AND OTHER EXISTING

01:10:06.168 --> 01:10:08.170
PRACTICES THAT ESSENTIALLY IN

01:10:08.237 --> 01:10:08.804
THE LAST TWO YEARS WE'VE

01:10:08.871 --> 01:10:11.240
DEVELOPED- IN IN GETTING OUT

01:10:11.307 --> 01:10:14.510
GRANTS TO SMALL BUSINESSES FOR

01:10:14.577 --> 01:10:15.511
RELIEF. I WOULD ALSO DO

01:10:15.578 --> 01:10:17.379
CAMPAIGNS MEDIA CAMPAIGNS IN

01:10:17.446 --> 01:10:18.948
MULTIPLE LANGUAGES THAT'S

01:10:19.014 --> 01:10:20.816
SOMETHING THAT WE'VE SORT OF

01:10:20.883 --> 01:10:22.885
WORKED OUT AND ARE. MOVING

01:10:22.952 --> 01:10:24.620
TOWARDS A SUCCESSFUL MODEL SO WE

01:10:24.687 --> 01:10:26.488
WOULD BASICALLY BE LEVERAGING

01:10:26.555 --> 01:10:28.123
THE COMPANY RELIEF GRANT

01:10:28.190 --> 01:10:30.359
PROGRAM. TRYING TO USE THE

01:10:30.426 --> 01:10:32.094
NETWORKS AND THE PRACTICES WE-

01:10:32.161 --> 01:10:34.430
WE'VE SEEN THAT ARE EFFECTIVE IN

01:10:34.496 --> 01:10:36.165
GETTING AWARENESS UP. AND ALSO

01:10:36.231 --> 01:10:37.566
ENSURES THAT DISADVANTAGED

01:10:37.633 --> 01:10:39.268
COMMUNITIES HAVE A MAXIMUM

01:10:39.335 --> 01:10:41.203
PARTICIPATION. THAT WHILE ALL

01:10:41.270 --> 01:10:43.872
LEAVE IT THERE BUT- HAPPY TO ADD

01:10:43.939 --> 01:10:45.808
ANYTHING IF THAT'S HELPFUL. DO

01:10:45.874 --> 01:10:49.511
YOU THINK THAT THE PROGRAM WILL

01:10:49.578 --> 01:10:52.314
BE OVERSUBSCRIBED. WE DO THINK

01:10:52.381 --> 01:10:54.283
THE AWFUL FIVE HUNDRED WILL GO

01:10:54.350 --> 01:10:56.218
OUT AND PROBABLY YOU KNOW

01:10:56.285 --> 01:10:59.388
RELATIVELY QUICKLY- THERE'S

01:10:59.455 --> 01:11:02.091
BEEN- THE THOUGH THE WAY IT'S

01:11:02.157 --> 01:11:04.493
GONE IS IT'S NOW. THERE'S BEEN A

01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:05.995
COUPLE DIFFERENT WAYS OF FUNDING

01:11:06.061 --> 01:11:08.063
THROUGH THE COVERED RELIEF GRANT

01:11:08.130 --> 01:11:09.898
PROGRAM SO WE HAVE A SENSE OF.

01:11:09.965 --> 01:11:11.967
THAT THE TIMING ON HOW THOSE

01:11:12.034 --> 01:11:13.969
WAYS OF FINDING GO OUT. AND IN

01:11:14.036 --> 01:11:15.371
RECENT MONTHS THERE'S BEEN A

01:11:15.437 --> 01:11:17.006
LITTLE BIT OF A SLOWDOWN WHICH

01:11:17.072 --> 01:11:18.941
DOES MAKE US THINK THAT THE FIVE

01:11:19.008 --> 01:11:20.376
HUNDRED. I IS A PRETTY GOOD-

01:11:20.442 --> 01:11:22.277
ESTIMATE FOR TERMS OF IT

01:11:22.344 --> 01:11:24.513
WOULDN'T GO OUT DAY ONE IT'S NOT

01:11:24.580 --> 01:11:27.549
IS IT- GOING TO THE FULL. VALUE

01:11:27.616 --> 01:11:28.283
WOULD BE MASSIVELY

01:11:28.350 --> 01:11:30.753
OVERSUBSCRIBED SO WERE WE DON'T

01:11:30.819 --> 01:11:31.787
CLAIM THAT THIS IS THE PERFECT

01:11:31.854 --> 01:11:33.322
NUMBER BUT WE DO CLAIM IT'S- I

01:11:33.389 --> 01:11:36.492
PRETTY. SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT AND

01:11:36.558 --> 01:11:38.694
THAT THE THAT IN OUR OVERALL

01:11:38.761 --> 01:11:43.332
FISCAL RESILIENCY DESIGN IS- IT

01:11:43.399 --> 01:11:46.435
SORT OF. MAKES SENSE. OKAY THANK

01:11:46.502 --> 01:11:48.404
YOU I KNOW IN IN OUR LAST

01:11:48.470 --> 01:11:51.073
HEARING WE DISCUSSED- YOU KNOW

01:11:51.140 --> 01:11:52.241
HOW HOW DO WE EXTEND

01:11:52.307 --> 01:11:54.243
OPPORTUNITIES TO BUSINESSES AND

01:11:54.309 --> 01:11:56.578
OUTRAGE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS. SO

01:11:56.645 --> 01:11:58.414
THAT WE'RE NOT GOING AFTER THE

01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:00.082
SAME BUSINESSES THAT HAVE

01:12:00.149 --> 01:12:02.584
ALREADY. APPLIED OR HAVE

01:12:02.651 --> 01:12:04.620
KNOWLEDGE AS TO HOW TO APPLY BUT

01:12:04.687 --> 01:12:05.988
REALLY. ALSO INCLUDE AN

01:12:06.055 --> 01:12:08.223
OPPORTUNITY TO DO OUTREACH TO

01:12:08.290 --> 01:12:09.858
COMMUNITIES OF INTEREST YOU KNOW

01:12:09.925 --> 01:12:11.126
DIFFERENT LANGUAGES DIFFERENT

01:12:11.193 --> 01:12:13.429
CULTURES. TO ENSURE THAT THEY

01:12:13.495 --> 01:12:16.098
TOO ARE ALSO PART OF. THE

01:12:16.165 --> 01:12:17.032
CONVERSATION ON ECONOMIC

01:12:17.099 --> 01:12:22.037
RECOVERY. YEAH I'LL JUST ECHO

01:12:22.104 --> 01:12:24.073
THAT POINT AND KNOW THAT

01:12:24.139 --> 01:12:25.140
CALLAWAY'S BA IS DEFINITELY

01:12:25.207 --> 01:12:26.842
TAKING THAT. INTO CONSIDERATION

01:12:26.909 --> 01:12:29.244
THAT'S BEEN THEIR GOAL AND THERE

01:12:29.311 --> 01:12:30.646
HAS BEEN A LEARNING CURVE BUT IT

01:12:30.713 --> 01:12:32.648
WORKED WE'VE GOTTEN BETTER AND

01:12:32.715 --> 01:12:36.151
WE ANTICIPATE THAT THE- YEAH

01:12:36.218 --> 01:12:37.786
RICH HERE IS ALREADY IN PLACE

01:12:37.853 --> 01:12:40.055
THE TO THE NETWORKS OF TECHNICAL

PARTNERS TO HELP GET THE WORD

01:12:43.592 --> 01:12:45.561
OUT AND SO WE'RE- WE WOULD BE

01:12:45.627 --> 01:12:47.563
EXCITED BECAUSE WE THINK THERE'S

01:12:47.629 --> 01:12:49.565

THOSE AGENCIES WITHIN. EIGHT

01:45:28.989 --> 01:45:30.924

01:45:56.450 --> 01:45:57.884
ASSIST IN FILLING SOME OF THAT

01:45:57.951 --> 01:46:02.923
GAP THAT- COULD BE AN OBVIOUSLY

01:46:02.989 --> 01:46:04.391
FROM A MORE URBAN SETTING. OKAY

01:46:04.458 --> 01:46:06.159

01:46:21.341 --> 01:46:22.776
DIFFICULT BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN

01:46:22.843 --> 01:46:24.478
THAT THOSE PEOPLE ARE DESERVING

01:46:24.544 --> 01:46:27.013
OF THEIR- OF THEIR SUPPORT IT'S

01:46:27.080 --> 01:46:29.683
NOT FAIR. FOR THEM TO BE DENIED

01:46:29.750 --> 01:46:31.017
JUST BECAUSE IT'S MORE DIFFICULT

01:46:31.084 --> 01:46:32.686

01:50:33.026 --> 01:50:34.961
APPRENTICES IN SECTORS SUCH AS

01:50:35.028 --> 01:50:36.863
TO GIVE YOU A FEW. CONCRETE

01:50:36.930 --> 01:50:39.099
EXAMPLES OF WHO COULD BE

01:50:39.165 --> 01:50:41.468
POTENTIAL RECIPIENTS OF THE FUND

01:50:41.534 --> 01:50:43.036
- ONE EXAMPLE IS THERE'S A GROUP

01:50:43.103 --> 01:50:44.304
CALLED THE LAUNCH APPRENTICESHIP

01:50:44.371 --> 01:50:45.438
NETWORK WHICH IS IN THE INLAND

01:50:45.505 --> 01:50:48.108
EMPIRE. AND THIS IS AN EXAMPLE

01:50:48.174 --> 01:50:49.609
OF A REGIONAL APPRENTICESHIP

01:50:49.676 --> 01:50:51.878
INTERMEDIARY SO THEY HAVE THEY

01:50:51.945 --> 01:50:53.146
ALREADY HAVE OCCUPATIONS

01:50:53.213 --> 01:50:55.648
REGISTERED IN AUTOMOTIVE HEALTH

01:50:55.715 --> 01:50:58.318

CHAIN EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION

01:51:01.187 --> 01:51:02.655
SO THEY ARE A REGIONAL

01:51:02.722 --> 01:51:04.257
INTERMEDIARY THAT'S SERVING

01:51:04.324 --> 01:51:06.726
MULTIPLE OCCUPATIONS. I'M A

01:51:06.793 --> 01:51:09.129
DIFFERENT KIND OF EXAMPLE IS WE

01:51:09.195 --> 01:51:10.563
HAVE A PROGRAM WITH THE

01:51:10.630 --> 01:51:11.898
CALIFORNIA CORRECTIONAL HEALTH

01:51:11.965 --> 01:51:14.734
CARE SERVICES AND SEIU LOCAL ONE

01:51:14.801 --> 01:51:16.903
THOUSAND. AND BAND HAVE CREATED

01:51:16.970 --> 01:51:18.438
A PATHWAY FOR LICENSED

01:51:18.505 --> 01:51:20.073
VOCATIONAL NURSES TO BECOME

01:51:20.140 --> 01:51:22.409
REGISTERED NURSES AND THIS

01:51:22.475 --> 01:51:25.478
PROGRAM IS PHENOMENAL IT HAS 75%

01:51:25.545 --> 01:51:28.214
WOMEN 80% OF MINORITIES AND-

01:51:28.281 --> 01:51:30.283
THROUGH THAT PROGRAM THEY MORE

01:51:30.350 --> 01:51:32.052
THAN DOUBLED THEIR WAGES THEY GO

01:51:32.118 --> 01:51:33.486
FOR MAKING FORTY TWO THOUSAND

01:51:33.553 --> 01:51:35.955
DOLLARS A YEAR TO OVER A HUNDRED

01:51:36.022 --> 01:51:37.490
THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR SO THIS

01:51:37.557 --> 01:51:38.491
IS. JUST ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THE

01:51:38.558 --> 01:51:40.927
KIND OF PROGRAMS THAT WOULD BE

01:51:40.994 --> 01:51:46.266
ABLE. TO SCALE- WITH THIS

01:51:46.332 --> 01:51:48.134
FUNDING SOME OTHER EXAM. IS- WHY

01:51:48.201 --> 01:51:49.836
IN THIS HOW WHICH IS OUT OF. HAS

01:51:49.903 --> 01:51:52.272
AND- DEVELOP UPON PRO. SAN

01:51:52.338 --> 01:51:53.506
JOAQUIN COUNTY SCHOOL

01:51:53.573 --> 01:51:54.941

TECHNOLOGY SUPPORT SPECIALIST.

01:51:58.478 --> 01:52:00.413
AND THAT PROGRAM ACTUALLY STARTS

01:52:00.480 --> 01:52:02.782
IN HIGH SCHOOL SO I'M NOT

01:52:02.849 --> 01:52:04.617
CERTAIN EXAMPLE ABOUT- AN EARLY

01:52:04.684 --> 01:52:06.453
MOVER IN TERMS OF HIGH SCHOOL

01:52:06.519 --> 01:52:08.388
AND YOUTH APPRENTICESHIP- AND

01:52:08.455 --> 01:52:09.823
THEN I'VE ALSO MENTIONED THE

APPRENTICESHIPS THAT'S BEGINNING

01:52:12.859 --> 01:52:14.928
FARM AND RANCH MANAGERS SO. THIS

01:52:14.994 --> 01:52:16.896
IS JUST THAT A SET OF EXAMPLES

01:52:16.963 --> 01:52:18.498
TO OFFER YOU THERE ARE

01:52:18.565 --> 01:52:20.400

TODAY IN THIS AYE ACCESS SPACE

01:52:24.737 --> 01:52:27.073
OF APPRENTICESHIP- BUT THAT. THE

01:52:27.140 --> 01:52:30.110
MEAN NUMBER OF APPRENTICES IS

01:52:30.176 --> 01:52:31.077
TWELVE SO WHAT THAT SHOULD TELL

YOU IS THAT WE HAVE PROOF OF

01:52:33.079 --> 01:52:33.780
CONCEPT BUT THERE'S REALLY A

01:52:33.847 --> 01:52:35.348
NEED TO SCALE AND AS WE'VE

01:52:35.415 --> 01:52:36.883

NEW APPRENTICES BY TWENTY TWENTY

01:55:09.335 --> 01:55:11.104

ON AVERAGE. SEVENTY ONE THOUSAND

01:55:13.006 --> 01:55:14.641

FEASIBLE. PRESIDENT SO WE

01:55:19.812 --> 01:55:22.215
CERTAINLY DID A LOT OF-

01:55:22.282 --> 01:55:25.251
FORECASTING AND MODELING TO TRY

01:55:25.318 --> 01:55:26.786
TO THINK ABOUT. WHAT WHAT WAS I

01:55:26.853 --> 01:55:28.821
REQUEST FOR FUNDING THIS

01:55:28.888 --> 01:55:31.224
PARTICULAR FUNDING REQUEST IS

01:55:31.291 --> 01:55:32.825
FOR TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY

01:55:32.892 --> 01:55:33.426
MILLION DOLLARS THAT WILL BE

01:55:33.493 --> 01:55:35.461
SPENT OVER THREE YEARS AND TWO

01:55:35.528 --> 01:55:37.830
YEARS IS NOT SEVEN YEARS RIGHT.

01:55:37.897 --> 01:55:40.466
MMHM SO THE IDEA HERE IS THAT WE

01:55:40.533 --> 01:55:43.536
WANT TO BE DEMONSTRATING HOW

01:55:43.603 --> 01:55:45.672
THIS NEW FUNDING MECHANISM WILL

01:55:45.738 --> 01:55:48.274
INDEED HELP SCALE I AKA

01:55:48.341 --> 01:55:50.310
APPRENTICESHIPS- SO RIGHT NOW

01:55:50.376 --> 01:55:52.745
THERE'S ABOUT SIXTEEN THOUSAND I

01:55:52.812 --> 01:55:53.913
ACT APPRENTICESHIPS AND WE WANT

01:55:53.980 --> 01:55:57.283
TO BE DOUBLING NOT ROUGHLY BY

01:55:57.350 --> 01:55:59.419
MAKING THIS INVESTMENTS OVER THE

01:55:59.485 --> 01:56:01.988
COMING THREE YEARS- THAT WOULD

01:56:02.055 --> 01:56:03.990
GET US ON THE RIGHT TRAJECTORY

01:56:04.057 --> 01:56:06.092
TOWARD SERVING FIVE HUNDRED

01:56:06.159 --> 01:56:07.527
THOUSAND APPRENTICES BY TWENTY

01:56:07.593 --> 01:56:09.462
TWENTY NINE- BUT WE WANT TO

01:56:09.529 --> 01:56:11.264
START WITH THIS INVESTMENT TO

01:56:11.331 --> 01:56:12.965
DEMONSTRATE THAT THIS IS GOING

01:56:13.032 --> 01:56:14.434
TO PROVIDE A BRIDGE OF FUNDING.

01:56:14.500 --> 01:56:15.902
THAT REALLY BROKE INTO THE KIND

01:56:15.968 --> 01:56:17.170
OF SCALING UP IRAQ

01:56:17.236 --> 01:56:18.638
APPRENTICESHIPS THAT THAT WE

01:56:18.705 --> 01:56:22.475
WANT. TO BE MAKING AN- THANK YOU

01:56:22.542 --> 01:56:25.445
AND JUST. UP TO US I NEED SOME.

01:56:25.511 --> 01:56:27.547
WIRED THE- WHERE BUILDING TRADE

01:56:27.613 --> 01:56:28.548
APPRENTICESHIPS NOT INCLUDED IN

01:56:28.614 --> 01:56:32.352
THE PROPOSAL. GREAT QUESTION SO

01:56:32.418 --> 01:56:35.388
ACTUALLY IN- IN THE MAY REVISED

01:56:35.455 --> 01:56:38.424
THERE ARE TWO INVESTMENTS IN

01:56:38.491 --> 01:56:40.760
APPRENTICESHIP GENERALLY ONE IS

01:56:40.827 --> 01:56:41.794
WHAT WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT

01:56:41.861 --> 01:56:43.696
IN SCALING I ACT THAT

01:56:43.763 --> 01:56:45.198
APPRENTICESHIPS- BUT THERE'S

01:56:45.264 --> 01:56:47.633
ALSO A PROPOSAL TO INCREASE THE

01:56:47.700 --> 01:56:49.369
RELATED AND SUPPLEMENTAL

01:56:49.435 --> 01:56:52.071
INSTRUCTION FUNDING WHICH IS TOP

01:56:52.138 --> 01:56:53.973
NINETY EIGHT FUNDING- AND THIS

01:56:54.040 --> 01:56:56.542
IS UTILIZED HEAVILY BY THE C. A.

01:56:56.609 --> 01:56:58.244
C. PROGRAMS TO COVER THE

01:56:58.311 --> 01:57:00.546
TRAINING COSTS. AND HISTORICALLY

01:57:00.613 --> 01:57:02.815
THAT HAVE BEEN BENCHMARKS TO THE

01:57:02.882 --> 01:57:05.184
NOT FOR CREDIT EDUCATION RATES

01:57:05.251 --> 01:57:07.153
IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM

01:57:07.220 --> 01:57:09.355
AND- IN THIS BUDGET PROPOSAL IS

01:57:09.422 --> 01:57:11.824
BEING PROPOSED TO BRING THAT UP

01:57:11.891 --> 01:57:12.892
TO THE FOR CREDIT RATING AND

01:57:12.959 --> 01:57:15.094
REALLY IT'S DEMONSTRATING HOW

01:57:15.161 --> 01:57:17.397
MUCH WE VALUE APPRENTICESHIP

01:57:17.463 --> 01:57:20.967
EDUCATION AND- WE REALLY WANT TO

01:57:21.033 --> 01:57:22.635
BE CULTIVATING THE WHOLE

01:57:22.702 --> 01:57:24.370
ECOSYSTEM OF APPRENTICESHIP AND

01:57:24.437 --> 01:57:25.538
WE'RE HOPEFUL THAT WITH THIS

01:57:25.605 --> 01:57:27.473
OMBINED INVESTMENT THAT'S BEING

01:57:27.540 --> 01:57:30.443
PROPOSED. THAT WILL BE- LIFTING

01:57:30.510 --> 01:57:31.577
THE TITLE BUT IT'S RIGHT THAT

01:57:31.644 --> 01:57:34.380
REALLY INVESTING BOTH AND- WELL

01:57:34.447 --> 01:57:37.683
ESTABLISHED CA SEE PROGRAMS AND

01:57:37.750 --> 01:57:40.253
ALSO SPARKING A WHOLE LOT BROKE

01:57:40.319 --> 01:57:44.791
THE INDIA. AFTER PROGRAMS AS

01:57:44.857 --> 01:57:46.392
