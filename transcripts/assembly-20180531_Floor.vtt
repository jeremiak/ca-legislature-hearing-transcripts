ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE

02:29:08.272 --> 02:29:09.407

02:29:28.626 --> 02:29:29.527
INVESTMENTS THAT WE COULD BE

02:29:29.593 --> 02:29:31.495
MAKING RIGHT NOW EDUCATION IS

02:29:31.562 --> 02:29:33.130
WHERE WE SHOULD BE MAKING IT.

02:29:33.197 --> 02:29:34.965
NOW I WILL ADD OUR WORK IS NOT

02:29:35.032 --> 02:29:40.638
DONE.

02:29:40.705 --> 02:29:41.472
CINDY MORE MONEY AT OUR SCHOOLS

02:29:41.539 --> 02:29:42.306
WITHOUT REFORMING HOW WE OPERATE

02:29:42.373 --> 02:29:42.907
THEM WITHOUT BRINGING GREATER

02:29:42.973 --> 02:29:44.742
TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY.

02:29:44.809 --> 02:29:46.711
ENSURING THAT WE HAVE EFFECTIVE

CLASSROOM ACROSS OF THIS STATE

02:29:51.248 --> 02:29:51.816
AND THAT WE HAVE GREAT

02:29:51.882 --> 02:29:53.484
PRINCIPLES FOR MANAGERS OF EVERY

02:29:53.551 --> 02:29:55.486
SINGLE SCHOOL. THAT MEANS OUR

02:29:55.553 --> 02:29:56.887
WORK IS INCOMPLETE.

02:29:56.954 --> 02:29:58.789
BUT IT STARTS BY BACKING THOSE

02:29:58.856 --> 02:29:59.990
SCHOOLS UP WITH THE FUNDING THEY

02:30:00.057 --> 02:30:01.892

OFTEN WITHOUT THE OPTIMAL LEVEL

02:30:38.529 --> 02:30:40.831
OF RESOURCES.

02:30:40.898 --> 02:30:42.266

WHAT THIS CRISIS DEMANDS OF US

02:31:03.554 --> 02:31:05.956
IS THE SENSE OF URGENCY?

02:31:06.023 --> 02:31:07.458
BUT TODAY'S BILL REPRESENTS

02:31:07.525 --> 02:31:07.892
NOTHING.

02:31:07.958 --> 02:31:11.028
THE KIND.

02:31:11.095 --> 02:31:12.463

ANNUAL SPENDING ON EDUCATION HAS

02:31:24.742 --> 02:31:26.076
INCREASED BY THIRTY BILLION

02:31:26.143 --> 02:31:28.379
DOLLARS.

02:31:28.446 --> 02:31:29.914
PER PUPIL SPENDING WAS THIS BILL

02:31:29.980 --> 02:31:31.849

HAS GROWN FROM JUST OVER TWELVE

02:31:33.484 --> 02:31:35.119

LEARNERS. ARE NOT MEETING

02:31:53.537 --> 02:31:55.873
STANDARDS IN FOURTH GRADE MATH.

02:31:55.940 --> 02:31:57.408

FOR FOURTH GRADE MATH SO THE

02:32:06.750 --> 02:32:08.719
QUESTION WE HAVE TO ASK IS.

02:32:08.786 --> 02:32:10.154
IF THE LAST THIRTY BILLION

02:32:10.221 --> 02:32:12.189
DIDN'T MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

02:32:12.256 --> 02:32:15.759
WHY WILL THE NEXT THIRTY BILLION?

02:32:15.826 --> 02:32:18.062
WHAT'S MOST TRAGIC IS THAT ALL

02:32:18.128 --> 02:32:19.363
OF THIS WAS ENTIRELY PREDICTABLE

02:32:19.430 --> 02:32:20.698
IN FACT

02:32:20.764 --> 02:32:22.733
IT WAS PREDICTED.

02:32:22.800 --> 02:32:24.869
IN A TWO THOUSAND SEVEN REPORT

02:32:24.935 --> 02:32:26.237
COMMISSIONED BY THE STATE OF

02:32:26.303 --> 02:32:27.872
CALIFORNIA ITSELF.

02:32:27.938 --> 02:32:29.507
THAT REPORT TITLED GETTING DOWN

02:32:29.573 --> 02:32:31.275
TO FACTS CONCLUDED.

02:32:31.342 --> 02:32:33.444
MORE MONEY IN THE CURRENT SYSTEM

02:32:33.511 --> 02:32:35.412
IS UNLIKELY TO DRAMATICALLY

02:32:35.479 --> 02:32:36.347
IMPROVE STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT TO

02:32:36.413 --> 02:32:38.382
MEET EXPECTATIONS.

02:32:38.449 --> 02:32:39.483
IN LAS ACCOMPANIED BY

02:32:39.550 --> 02:32:40.985
SIGNIFICANT.

02:32:41.051 --> 02:32:43.654
STOMACH REFORMS.

02:32:43.721 --> 02:32:45.789
NOTABLY THE REPORT ALSO STATED

02:32:45.856 --> 02:32:46.824
THAT PRINCIPLE SITE GREATER

02:32:46.891 --> 02:32:48.959
FLEXIBILITY IN DISMISSING

02:32:49.026 --> 02:32:50.995
INEFFECTIVE TEACHERS AT THE MOST

02:32:51.061 --> 02:32:53.230
ESSENTIAL CHANGE NEEDED TO

IMPROVE STUDENT OUTCOMES

02:32:54.999 --> 02:32:56.600

AS I WAS SAYING THIS IS JUST ONE

02:34:22.886 --> 02:34:24.288
EXAMPLE OF OUR LEGISLATURE'S

02:34:24.355 --> 02:34:25.889

ADMINISTRATION.

02:34:39.403 --> 02:34:40.771
TODAY'S BILL ALSO RAISES THE

02:34:40.838 --> 02:34:42.506
QUESTION AS TO WHERE ALL OF THIS

02:34:42.573 --> 02:34:43.540
MONEY HAS BEEN GOING. AND THERE

02:34:43.607 --> 02:34:45.509
ARE TWO ANSWERS TO THAT.

02:34:45.576 --> 02:34:46.844
THE FIRST IS THAT INCREASINGLY

02:34:46.910 --> 02:34:48.412
IT'S GOING NOT TO THE CLASSROOM

02:34:48.479 --> 02:34:48.979
BUT TO IMPLEMENT RETIREMENT

02:34:49.046 --> 02:34:50.347
COSTS

02:34:50.414 --> 02:34:51.348
THERE ARE A LOT OF DISTRICTS IN

02:34:51.415 --> 02:34:52.950
SUPPORT OF AB SCHOOL DISTRICTS

02:34:53.017 --> 02:34:54.284
IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL AND I

02:34:54.351 --> 02:34:55.753
DON'T BLAME THEM BECAUSE THIS IS

02:34:55.819 --> 02:34:57.354
OVERWHELMING. THEIR BUDGETS

02:34:57.421 --> 02:34:58.889
SAN FRANCISCO UNIFIED FOR

02:34:58.956 --> 02:35:00.424
EXAMPLE IS DIVERTING A HUNDRED

02:35:00.491 --> 02:35:02.192
MILLION DOLLARS TO RETIREMENT

02:35:02.259 --> 02:35:03.627
COST THIS YEAR THAT'S TWO

02:35:03.694 --> 02:35:04.962
THOUSAND PER STUDENT THIS YEAR

02:35:05.029 --> 02:35:06.897
TWICE AS MUCH AS JUST FIVE YEARS

02:35:06.964 --> 02:35:08.599
AGO SOCIAL WE SHOULD BE CLEAR.

02:35:08.666 --> 02:35:10.000
THAT WITHOUT MEANINGFUL PENSION

02:35:10.067 --> 02:35:11.869
AND HEALTH CARE REFORM WE TALK

02:35:11.935 --> 02:35:13.337
ABOUT ADDITIONAL FUNDING WE ARE

02:35:13.404 --> 02:35:15.105
NOT TALKING ABOUT FUNDING THAT'S

02:35:15.172 --> 02:35:16.040
GOING TO ACTED TEACHERS ARE TO

02:35:16.106 --> 02:35:17.808
SCHOOLS.

02:35:17.875 --> 02:35:18.609
BUT THE SECOND ANSWERED THAT

02:35:18.676 --> 02:35:20.444
QUESTION AS TO WHERE THE MONEY'S

02:35:20.511 --> 02:35:21.745
GOING AS WE REALLY DON'T KNOW.

ANOTHER ELEMENT OF TRANSPARENCY

02:35:26.550 --> 02:35:27.584
AS TO HOW FUNDING IS BEING

02:35:27.651 --> 02:35:29.253
DELIVERED TO DISTRICTS WE STILL

02:35:29.319 --> 02:35:30.187
HAVE A LITTLE INFORMATION ON

02:35:30.254 --> 02:35:31.488
WHAT ACTUALLY MATTERS.

02:35:31.555 --> 02:35:32.690
HOW MUCH OF THIS MONEY IS

02:35:32.756 --> 02:35:34.091
ACTUALLY REACHING SCHOOLS TO

02:35:34.158 --> 02:35:35.325
EIGHT ARE HARD WORKING

02:35:35.392 --> 02:35:37.094
PRINCIPLES TEACHERS SUPPORT

02:35:42.666 --> 02:35:44.735
EXCUSE

02:39:42.439 --> 02:39:43.941
THE BAY AREA LIKE MANY OTHER

02:39:44.007 --> 02:39:44.875
PARTS OF OUR STATE ARE SUFFERING

02:39:44.942 --> 02:39:46.877
FROM THE TWIN CRISES OF HOUSING

02:39:46.944 --> 02:39:48.812
AND TRAFFIC CONGESTION.

02:39:48.879 --> 02:39:50.147
BECAUSE OF A LACK OF HOUSING

02:39:50.213 --> 02:39:51.248
WITH COUNTLESS RESIDENTS

AND VACANT LOTS BY NIGHT.

02:40:09.166 --> 02:40:10.634
THIS BILL IS NEEDED BECAUSE PART

HAS BEEN AROUND FOR FORTY FIVE

02:40:11.535 --> 02:40:13.737

02:40:16.573 --> 02:40:17.674
TOO MANY CITIES HAVE BUILT NO

02:40:17.741 --> 02:40:19.409
HOUSING NEXT TO STATIONS AND THE

02:40:19.476 --> 02:40:20.477
ONES THAT DID WATER DOWN

02:40:20.544 --> 02:40:22.713
PROJECTS. THAT TOOK TEN TO

02:40:22.779 --> 02:40:24.314
THIRTY YEARS FOR APPROVAL.

02:40:24.381 --> 02:40:25.816
THIS IS A NARROWLY TAILORED

02:40:25.882 --> 02:40:27.217
TRANSIT OR IN DEVELOPMENT BILL.

02:40:27.284 --> 02:40:29.553
IT ONLY APPLIES TO PARK ON LAND

AREAS.

02:40:35.425 --> 02:40:37.060
BART TODAY IRONICALLY COULD

02:40:37.127 --> 02:40:38.562
BUILD TRANSIT MAINTENANCE OR

WITH TWENTY PERCENT HOUSING

02:40:59.349 --> 02:41:00.717
AFFORDABILITY AND THE CITY WOULD

02:41:00.784 --> 02:41:01.518
HAVE TWO YEARS TO UPDATE MORE

02:41:01.585 --> 02:41:04.121
SPECIFIC ZONING.

02:41:04.187 --> 02:41:06.189
BART WOULD BE ALSO REQUIRED TO

INCORPORATE LOCAL DESIGN

HOUSING OBLIGATIONS UNDER ARENA.

THIS BILL WILL ALLOW TWENTY

TO BE BUILT NEAR BART STATIONS

02:41:21.371 --> 02:41:22.272
IT WOULD INCREASE TRANSIT

RIDERSHIP SUSTAINABILITY WALK

THE EXISTING APPROACH TO HOUSING

02:41:55.405 --> 02:41:56.139
AND TRANSIT DEVELOPMENT IS NOT

02:41:56.206 --> 02:41:57.808
WORKING.

02:41:57.874 --> 02:41:58.775
THE PROBLEM IS NOT THAT

02:41:58.842 --> 02:41:59.976
DEVELOPMENT AROUND BART

02:42:00.043 --> 02:42:01.945
CONFLICTS WITH LOCAL POLICY

GENERALLY THESE COMMUNITIES ARE

MIXED USE COMMUNITIES ADJACENT

02:42:07.951 --> 02:42:09.920
TO BART. BUT LOCAL FACTIONS

02:42:09.986 --> 02:42:12.222
AROUND BART STATIONS ARE ABLE TO

02:42:12.289 --> 02:42:14.658

KEY SITES REMAIN UNDEVELOPED

02:42:24.468 --> 02:42:26.203
EVEN AFTER TWENTY YEARS.

02:42:26.269 --> 02:42:27.671

AND THE LAST FIVE YEARS.

02:42:41.885 --> 02:42:42.919

POSSIBLE TO ADDRESS IN THE CLOSE

02:44:07.771 --> 02:44:08.638
MY ADDITIONAL QUESTION WHICH

02:44:08.705 --> 02:44:11.241
WHICH. SPECIFIC CITIES WILL THIS

02:44:11.308 --> 02:44:11.975
APPLY TO

02:44:12.042 --> 02:44:13.710
WHICH SPECIFIC TOWNS HAVE NOT

02:44:13.777 --> 02:44:14.911
DONE THEIR PART AND ALLOWED TO

02:44:14.978 --> 02:44:16.680
THAT QUESTION. FOR THOSE FOR

02:44:16.746 --> 02:44:18.148
WHOM THE HALF MILE RADIUS IS

02:44:18.215 --> 02:44:19.683
OPEN SPACE.

02:44:19.749 --> 02:44:21.952
AND PARK LANDS WHICH PARKS AND

02:44:22.018 --> 02:44:23.820
OPEN SPACE WOULD BE PROPOSED TO

02:44:23.887 --> 02:44:26.590
TEAR UP. AND DATA AND ALLOW PART

02:44:26.656 --> 02:44:28.325
TO BUILD HOUSING ON MY OWN TIME.

02:44:28.391 --> 02:44:30.160
I RESPECTFULLY RISE IN

02:44:30.227 --> 02:44:32.395
OPPOSITION. TO THIS LEGISLATION

02:44:32.462 --> 02:44:33.930
FOR A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT

02:44:33.997 --> 02:44:34.564
REASONS FIRST AND FOREMOST IT IS

02:44:34.631 --> 02:44:36.399
UNCONSTITUTIONAL.

02:44:36.466 --> 02:44:38.602
SECTION ELEVEN.

02:44:38.668 --> 02:44:39.869
ARTICLE ELEVEN SECTION ELEVEN

02:44:39.936 --> 02:44:41.304
SPECIFICALLY SAYS IN OUR

02:44:41.371 --> 02:44:42.973
CONSTITUTION THAT IT'S OUR

02:44:43.039 --> 02:44:44.574
CITIES AND COUNTIES THAT HAVE

02:44:44.641 --> 02:44:45.842
JURISDICTION OVER THEIR POLICE

02:44:45.909 --> 02:44:47.444
POWERS WHICH FUNDAMENTALLY

02:44:47.510 --> 02:44:48.278
INCLUDES.

02:44:48.345 --> 02:44:50.280
HOUSING.

02:44:50.347 --> 02:44:51.314
AND THERE'S A REASON WHY THIS

02:44:51.381 --> 02:44:52.882
MAKES COMPLETE AND TOTAL SENSE

02:44:52.949 --> 02:44:54.517
IN OUR CONSTITUTION AND THAT IS

02:44:54.584 --> 02:44:55.585
BECAUSE HOUSING WHAT YOUR

02:44:55.652 --> 02:44:57.053
NEIGHBORHOOD LOOKS LIKE HOW

02:44:57.120 --> 02:44:58.188
YOU'VE DESIGNED IT WHAT THE

02:44:58.255 --> 02:44:59.789
HEIGHT IS GOING TO BE WHAT THE

02:44:59.856 --> 02:45:01.024
DENSITY IS GOING TO BE THE

02:45:01.091 --> 02:45:02.392
PARKING AND THE EFFECT IT HAS ON

02:45:02.459 --> 02:45:03.760
YOUR. LOCAL COMMUNITY SHOULD BE

02:45:03.827 --> 02:45:05.328
DECIDED.

02:45:05.395 --> 02:45:07.197
BY THAT LOCAL COMMUNITY WHOSE

02:45:07.264 --> 02:45:08.565
BOARD MEMBERS WHETHER TO CITY

02:45:08.632 --> 02:45:10.267
COUNCILOR COUNTY BOARD ACTUALLY

02:45:10.333 --> 02:45:12.702
LIVE IN THAT COMMUNITY SO THIS

02:45:12.769 --> 02:45:13.970
BILL IN I REALIZE WE DON'T

02:45:14.037 --> 02:45:15.572
ALWAYS VOTE BASED ON WHETHER NOT

02:45:15.639 --> 02:45:17.274
SOMETHING IS CONSTITUTIONAL THIS

02:45:17.340 --> 02:45:19.476
BILL IS A COMPLETE VIOLATION. OF

02:45:19.542 --> 02:45:22.078
VERY EXPLICIT PROVISIONS OF OUR

02:45:22.145 --> 02:45:22.646
STATE CONSTITUTION BUT ASIDE

02:45:22.712 --> 02:45:23.947
FROM THAT.

02:45:24.014 --> 02:45:25.882
IF THIS WERE CONSTITUTIONAL THIS

02:45:25.949 --> 02:45:27.517
BILL IS ALSO WHEN I STRONGLY

02:45:27.584 --> 02:45:29.019
OPPOSE BECAUSE IT TAKES AN

02:45:29.085 --> 02:45:31.388
AGENCY THAT HAS ONE JOB AND THAT

02:45:31.454 --> 02:45:33.189
IS DELIVERING SAFE AND RELIABLE

02:45:33.256 --> 02:45:35.158
TRANSPORTATION.

02:45:35.225 --> 02:45:37.193
AND GIVES IT A COMPLETE EXPANDED

02:45:37.260 --> 02:45:38.428
AUTHORITY OVER SOMETHING IN

02:45:38.495 --> 02:45:41.298
WHICH IT HAS NO EXPERTISE AT ALL.

02:45:41.364 --> 02:45:42.599
YOU HEARD THE LANGUAGE HERE THAT

02:45:42.666 --> 02:45:44.200
THIS IS NARROWLY TAILORED THIS

02:45:44.267 --> 02:45:45.869
BILL IS NOT NARROWLY TAILORED IT

02:45:45.935 --> 02:45:47.337
SAYS TO A TRANSIT AGENCY UNIT

02:45:47.404 --> 02:45:48.938
MAY NOW BE THE EXCLUSIVE

02:45:49.005 --> 02:45:50.607
AUTHORITY. THAT IS GOING TO

02:45:50.674 --> 02:45:52.609
DECIDE HOW MUCH HOUSING IS

02:45:52.676 --> 02:45:53.710
WITHIN A HALF MILE OF APART

02:45:53.777 --> 02:45:55.979
STATION HOW DENSITY IS HOW MUCH

02:45:56.046 --> 02:45:57.547
IS AFFORDABLE WHETHER OR NOT IT

02:45:57.614 --> 02:45:59.015
HAS CERTAIN HEIGHTS HOW MUCH

02:45:59.082 --> 02:46:00.650
PARKING SPACES GO WITH IT. AND

02:46:00.717 --> 02:46:02.585
ALL OF THE ELEMENTS THAT GO

02:46:02.652 --> 02:46:03.953
WITHOUT.

02:46:04.020 --> 02:46:05.455
AND TRANSIT AGENCIES SHOULD BE

02:46:05.522 --> 02:46:07.223
FOCUSED ON DELIVERING RELIABLE

02:46:07.290 --> 02:46:10.126
CONTINUOUS AND SAFE SERVICE.

02:46:10.193 --> 02:46:11.261
NOW THIS IS BASICALLY LIKE

02:46:11.328 --> 02:46:12.962
TAKING.

02:46:13.029 --> 02:46:14.798
YOUR LOCAL DOG CATCHER.

02:46:14.864 --> 02:46:16.099
AND SAYING YOU KNOW WHAT WE

02:46:16.166 --> 02:46:16.966
DON'T THINK YOU'RE DOING THE

02:46:17.033 --> 02:46:19.202
FIRE DEPARTMENT WORK CORRECTLY

02:46:19.269 --> 02:46:20.470
WE KNOW BETTER THAN YOU SERVICE

02:46:20.537 --> 02:46:22.105
TAKE THE LOCAL DOT CATCHER AND

02:46:22.172 --> 02:46:23.640
PUT THEM IN CHARGE OF. YOUR FIRE

02:46:23.707 --> 02:46:25.508
DEPARTMENT.

02:46:25.575 --> 02:46:26.643
WHEN THE LOCAL DOG CATCHER HAS

02:46:26.710 --> 02:46:28.078
NO EXPERTISE AND HOW TO DO A

02:46:28.144 --> 02:46:30.380
FIRE DEPARTMENT AND IT'S WORSE.

02:46:30.447 --> 02:46:31.681
BECAUSE THE DOG CATCHER DOESN'T

02:46:31.748 --> 02:46:33.116
HAVE TO LIVE IN THE TOWN IN

02:46:33.183 --> 02:46:34.184
WHICH THE FIRE DEPARTMENT IS

02:46:34.250 --> 02:46:36.052
BECAUSE IN THIS BILL YOU CAN

02:46:36.119 --> 02:46:38.121
HAVE BART CONTROLLING HOUSING IN

02:46:38.188 --> 02:46:39.422
THE NEIGHBORHOOD FOR WHICH THERE

02:46:39.489 --> 02:46:40.924
IS ZERO REPRESENTATION ON THE

02:46:40.990 --> 02:46:42.225
BART BOARD. IF YOU'RE A PART

02:46:42.292 --> 02:46:43.960
DIRECTOR YOU DON'T HAVE TO LIVE

02:46:44.027 --> 02:46:45.362
IN THAT AREA WHERE YOU'RE GONNA

02:46:45.428 --> 02:46:46.896
HAVE CONTROL.

02:46:46.963 --> 02:46:48.498
SO YOU'RE ACTUALLY TELLING THEM

02:46:48.565 --> 02:46:50.767
THAT YOU WILL ALLOW BART TO

02:46:50.834 --> 02:46:53.036
CONTROL HOUSING IN YOUR AREA BUT

02:46:53.103 --> 02:46:54.404
BART DOESN'T HAVE TO LIVE THERE

02:46:54.471 --> 02:46:55.438
YES THERE'S A PART BOARD

02:46:55.505 --> 02:46:56.973
DIRECTOR WHO REPRESENTS A

02:46:57.040 --> 02:46:58.174
VARIETY OF TALENTS BUT THEY'RE

02:46:58.241 --> 02:46:59.376
GONNA BE MAKING THE DECISIONS

02:46:59.442 --> 02:47:01.578
FOR TOWNS I DON'T EVEN LIVE IN.

02:47:01.644 --> 02:47:02.011
SO EVEN IF IT WERE

02:47:02.078 --> 02:47:03.480
CONSTITUTIONAL EVEN IF IT MADE

02:47:03.546 --> 02:47:05.215
SENSE TO MAKE A TRANSIT AGENCY

02:47:05.281 --> 02:47:06.449
RESPONSIBLE FOR HOUSING THIS IS

02:47:06.516 --> 02:47:08.485
ALSO ABOUT BILL BECAUSE IT PUTS

02:47:08.551 --> 02:47:10.453
BART IN CHARGE OF HOUSING.

02:47:10.520 --> 02:47:11.755
BART HAS ENOUGH PROBLEMS RIGHT

02:47:11.821 --> 02:47:13.056
NOW AND THAT'S GIVEN THE TRAINS

02:47:13.123 --> 02:47:14.691
TO RUN ON TIME GIVING THE DRUG

02:47:14.758 --> 02:47:16.559
ADDICTS OUT OF THE STATIONS ALL

LINING. THE STATION'S AND FOR

02:47:19.829 --> 02:47:21.030
WHOM THEY CAN'T ENSURE SAFETY

02:47:21.097 --> 02:47:22.432
FOR THE WRITERS THERE IS A

02:47:22.499 --> 02:47:24.000
WRITER RECENTLY IN THE LAST FEW

02:47:24.067 --> 02:47:24.601

HEROIN USER. BART HAS ENOUGH

02:47:28.037 --> 02:47:29.806
PROBLEMS WE NEED TO FOCUS ON

02:47:29.873 --> 02:47:32.142
GETTING THEIR ORIGINAL JOB DONE

02:47:32.208 --> 02:47:33.042
CORRECTLY.

02:47:33.109 --> 02:47:35.745

02:47:35.812 --> 02:47:37.046
I ASK YOU MEMBERS IFYOU WOULD

FROM THE START BART WAS VERY

02:48:35.738 --> 02:48:37.106
VERY HESITANT.

02:48:37.173 --> 02:48:39.409

THERE'S NOTHING IN THIS BILL

05:05:14.796 --> 05:05:16.464
THAT SAYS THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT

05:05:16.531 --> 05:05:18.333

MAKING WHICH MAKES A LOT OF

05:05:29.744 --> 05:05:30.478
SENSE BECAUSE IF COMMUNITY

ELECTED GOVERNING BODY TO

I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT WE'RE

06:21:59.997 --> 06:22:02.199
TAKING THE WRONG APPROACH.

06:22:02.266 --> 06:22:03.267
ADD THIS LEAD BASED BILL.

06:22:03.333 --> 06:22:05.235

HOMES. WILL BE DIMINISHED.

06:22:20.951 --> 06:22:22.853
BY THIS PROCESS

06:22:22.919 --> 06:22:25.722
WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS START OVER

06:22:25.789 --> 06:22:27.224
AND START LOOKING AT WHAT THE

06:22:27.291 --> 06:22:30.160
COST WILL BE TO REMEDIATE LEAD.

06:22:30.227 --> 06:22:31.128
IN THESE PRE NINETEEN FIFTY ONE

06:22:31.194 --> 06:22:32.963
HOMES.

06:22:33.030 --> 06:22:34.231
THIS MONEY COULD BE ABSOLUTELY

06:22:34.298 --> 06:22:36.233
OUT OF REACH

06:22:36.300 --> 06:22:38.268

06:22:38.335 --> 06:22:40.671
AT THE ABSOLUTE COST.

06:22:40.737 --> 06:22:42.306
SOME OF THESE HOUSES HAVE

06:22:43.774 --> 06:22:45.842

SIX PANEL DOORS.

06:22:47.444 --> 06:22:48.612
THE COST COULD BE ABSOLUTELY

06:22:48.679 --> 06:22:50.213
PHENOMENAL.

06:22:50.280 --> 06:22:51.648
BUT IF WE LOOK AT IT INCOME FROM

06:22:51.715 --> 06:22:53.917
THIS APPROACH WE COULD BE GIVING

06:22:53.984 --> 06:22:56.019

WE NEED TO BE ABLE THE START

06:23:06.863 --> 06:23:08.799

AND CLAIMING THAT RETURNING ONE

06:53:27.682 --> 06:53:29.151
UNIT TO THE MARKET DOES NOT

06:53:29.217 --> 06:53:30.218
OBLIGATE THE LANDLORD TO RE

OFFER OTHER UNITS TO FORMER

06:53:31.353 --> 06:53:32.654
TENANTS.

06:53:32.721 --> 06:53:34.089
THIS IS ALLOWED LANDLORDS TO

06:53:34.156 --> 06:53:35.857
EFFECTIVELY WITHDRAWAL LESS THAN

06:53:35.924 --> 06:53:36.892

ACTUALLY LEAVE THE RENTAL MARKET

06:53:40.595 --> 06:53:41.630
AT ALL WHILE STILL HAVING

MISINTERPRETING THE LAW AS A

06:53:57.646 --> 06:54:00.315
RESULT OF SOME A A VERY FEW

06:54:00.382 --> 06:54:01.816
NUMBER OF LANDLORDS. SO IT'S

06:54:01.883 --> 06:54:03.652
EVEN MORE IMPERATIVE TO CLARIFY

06:54:03.718 --> 06:54:06.755
WHAT THE LAWS MEANT ALL LONG.

06:54:06.821 --> 06:54:08.557
THIS IS BEEN A DIFFICULT AND

06:54:08.623 --> 06:54:10.192
VERY TENSE CONVERSATION.

06:54:10.725 --> 06:54:12.994
BETWEEN TENANT ADVOCATES AND

06:54:13.061 --> 06:54:15.030
LANDLORDS.

06:54:15.096 --> 06:54:16.831
AND THIS BILL GIVES TENANTS SOME

06:54:16.898 --> 06:54:19.134
SECURITY IN KEEPING THEIR HOMES

06:54:19.201 --> 06:54:20.702
AT A TIME WHEN HOMELESSNESS FOR

06:54:20.769 --> 06:54:23.104
OUR POOR SENIORS DISABLED AND

06:54:23.171 --> 06:54:26.641
EVEN WORKING CLASS. IS A REALITY.

06:54:26.708 --> 06:54:28.276
AND MANY TIMES FOLKS RE JUST A

06:54:28.343 --> 06:54:31.413
PAYCHECK OR RENT INCREASE AWAY.

06:54:31.479 --> 06:54:32.948
I FROM HOMELESSNESS TO THE LACK

06:54:33.014 --> 06:54:34.449

DISPLACED AS A RESULT OF THE

06:54:37.886 --> 06:54:39.588
ELLIS ACT. SO THIS IS AN

06:54:39.654 --> 06:54:42.023
IMPORTANT IMPROVEMENT AND I

THESE TWO ABANDONED WELLS IT WAS

09:06:40.834 --> 09:06:42.703
FOUND THAT THE GHASTLY LEVEL

09:06:42.769 --> 09:06:44.938
LEAKAGE LEVELS WERE ADDED NEAR.

09:06:45.005 --> 09:06:46.707
THE EXPLOSIVE LIMIT WHICH IS A

09:06:46.773 --> 09:06:48.108
VERY DANGEROUS CONDITION FOR THE

RESIDENTIAL COMMUNITIES THAT IS

09:06:57.017 --> 09:06:59.319
OFTEN TIMES THE STATE THAT BURNS

09:06:59.386 --> 09:07:00.521
THE COSTS OF RELOCATING

MONEY BY HAVING THE DATA SOONER

09:07:06.894 --> 09:07:08.595

I WANNA BE EXTREMELY CLEAR ON

09:47:17.368 --> 09:47:18.536
THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION HAD

09:47:18.603 --> 09:47:20.071
A RECOMMENDATION THIS AREA THAT

09:47:20.138 --> 09:47:21.339

09:47:21.406 --> 09:47:24.709
THERE BE A PUBLIC.

09:47:24.776 --> 09:47:27.011
PUBLICATION STATEWIDE OF

09:47:29.280 --> 09:47:30.815
I HAD THAT BILL THE GOVERNOR

09:47:30.882 --> 09:47:32.317
VETOED THAT BILL.

09:47:32.383 --> 09:47:33.418
IT WAS SIMPLY GOING TO PUT

09:47:33.484 --> 09:47:34.719
INFORMATION OUT THERE ABOUT

09:47:34.786 --> 09:47:35.853
THESE DOLLARS WHICH ARE

09:47:35.920 --> 09:47:37.455

THIS BILL.

09:47:39.023 --> 09:47:40.224

09:47:45.830 --> 09:47:48.600
RECOMMENDATION HE VETOED IT.

09:47:48.666 --> 09:47:49.801

09:47:49.867 --> 09:47:50.335
VERY IMPORTANT EVOLUTION.

09:47:50.401 --> 09:47:52.170

IF THEY'RE NOT GOING TO DO THAT

09:59:07.077 --> 09:59:08.379

09:59:08.445 --> 09:59:09.713
IN OUR ABILITY TO MEET THOSE

09:59:09.780 --> 09:59:11.815

HEARD FROM YOUR MEMBERS OF THESE

09:59:13.250 --> 09:59:14.618
I HEAR FROM CONSTITUENTS WHY

DON'T WE HAVE MENTAL HEALTH

09:59:15.986 --> 09:59:16.820
ISSUES WHY DON'T WE HAVE ME

09:59:16.887 --> 09:59:18.422
MONEY FOR MENTAL HEALTH WHY

09:59:18.489 --> 09:59:19.490
DON'T WE HAVE COUNSELING

09:59:19.556 --> 09:59:20.991
PROGRAMS OF ALL THESE THINGS.

09:59:21.058 --> 09:59:22.526
AND I'M SAYING TO THEM WELL WE

09:59:22.593 --> 09:59:23.894
FUNDED IT WE GAVE IT TO THE

09:59:23.961 --> 09:59:25.362
COUNTY WE DID THIS DO THAT AND I

09:59:25.429 --> 09:59:27.031
COUNTY HAS NOT DONE ANYTHING

09:59:27.097 --> 09:59:28.265
WITH IT. THERE IS NO

09:59:28.332 --> 09:59:29.633
ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE MONEY

09:59:29.700 --> 09:59:31.268
THAT'S THERE IN TERMS OF US AS

09:59:31.335 --> 09:59:32.803
THE AGENCY THAT GAVE THEM THE

09:59:32.870 --> 09:59:34.271
MONEY TO DO THE PROGRAMS THAT

09:59:34.338 --> 09:59:36.373
WE'VE IDENTIFIED. AND SO IF

09:59:36.440 --> 09:59:37.574
WE'RE NOT GOING TO DO THAT THEN

09:59:37.641 --> 09:59:39.109
WHO THE HECK ARE WE. I MEAN

09:59:39.176 --> 09:59:40.744
WE'RE GIVING MONEY AND WOULD NOT

09:59:40.811 --> 09:59:42.813
A DEMANDING THAT THEY USE IT I

09:59:42.880 --> 09:59:43.914
DON'T BELIEVE THERE ARE COUNTY

09:59:43.981 --> 09:59:45.449
FOLKS ABED STUPID THAT THEY

09:59:45.516 --> 09:59:47.084
CAN'T FIGURE OUT HOW TO USE THE

09:59:47.151 --> 09:59:48.285
MONEY THAT THEY GET THAT WE'VE

09:59:48.352 --> 09:59:49.887
GIVEN THEM. SOME OF YOU GIVEN

09:59:49.953 --> 09:59:51.555
GREAT RECOMMENDATIONS PARTNER

09:59:51.622 --> 09:59:53.057
WOULD NONPROFITS ALL THOSE

09:59:53.123 --> 09:59:54.458
THINGS ARE ELIGIBLE THE A THAT

09:59:54.525 --> 09:59:57.127
THEY CAN DO. THEY CHOOSE NOT TO

09:59:57.194 --> 09:59:58.128
AND THAT'S ONE OF THINGS WE HAVE

09:59:58.195 --> 09:59:59.430
TO DEAL WITH IT'S NOT THAT THE

09:59:59.496 --> 10:00:00.964
LACK OF INFORMATION MOST OF OUR

10:00:01.031 --> 10:00:02.833
COUNTIES HAVE STAFF HAVE PEOPLE

10:00:02.900 --> 10:00:04.601
WHOSE JOBS ARE TO RUN THE COUNTY.

10:00:04.668 --> 10:00:05.636
TO DEAL WITH IT THE VARIOUS

10:00:05.703 --> 10:00:07.037
ISSUES TO MAKE SURE THAT THE

10:00:07.104 --> 10:00:09.306
MANAGEMENT OF THE RESOURCES IS

10:00:09.373 --> 10:00:10.741
THERE AND IF THEY GET YOU GOING

10:00:10.808 --> 10:00:11.642
TO GIVE THEM A COUPLE YEARS THIS

10:00:11.709 --> 10:00:13.143
EXPENDABLE AND THEY CAN'T FIGURE

10:00:13.210 --> 10:00:15.012
OUT HOW TO DO IT. THAN SOMEONE

10:00:15.079 --> 10:00:16.480
ELSE TO TAKE THE RESOURCES

10:00:16.547 --> 10:00:17.815
THEY'RE NOT THERE TO BANK THE

10:00:17.881 --> 10:00:19.316
MONEY THAT THEY'RE TO IMPLEMENT

10:00:19.383 --> 10:00:21.251
THE PROGRAMS THAT THE STATE HAS

10:00:21.318 --> 10:00:22.720
PUT IN PLACE FOR THEM TO DO WITH

10:00:22.786 --> 10:00:23.687
THE DOLLARS THAT WE'VE GIVEN

10:00:23.754 --> 10:00:25.489
THEM. SO I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOUR

10:00:25.556 --> 10:00:26.990
BOARD OF SUPERVISORS I KNOW

10:00:27.057 --> 10:00:28.492
ABOUT MINE AND SO MANY OTHERS

10:00:28.559 --> 10:00:29.860
THAT THAT ARE NOT MEETING THE

10:00:29.927 --> 10:00:31.295
NEEDS OF THE PEOPLE IN THOSE IN

10:00:31.362 --> 10:00:32.963
THOSE COUNTIES. AND THEY AND

10:00:33.030 --> 10:00:33.997
THAT THE BECAUSE THE COUNTIES

10:00:34.064 --> 10:00:35.799
ARE SO LARGE IN THE CONSTITUENCY

10:00:35.866 --> 10:00:37.434
GROUPS ARE SO HUGE THEY CAN

10:00:37.501 --> 10:00:38.635
PRETTY MUCH HIDE AND NOT

10:00:38.702 --> 10:00:40.204
SPENDING MONEY. SO I REALLY

10:00:40.270 --> 10:00:41.972
THINK THAT IS NOW TIME THAT WE

10:00:42.039 --> 10:00:43.540
THE FISH OR CUT BAIT YOU GOTTA

10:00:43.607 --> 10:00:45.209
DO WHAT YOU GOTTA DO AND THEY

10:00:45.275 --> 10:00:46.777
KNOW BECAUSE MOST OF YOU HAVE

10:00:46.844 --> 10:00:48.045
COMPLAIN TO THEM. YOUR

10:00:48.112 --> 10:00:49.413
CONSTITUENTS HAVE COMPLAINED

10:00:49.480 --> 10:00:50.514
THAT WOULD NOT GETTING THE

10:00:50.581 --> 10:00:52.316
SERVICES THAT WE NEED AND WHEN

10:00:52.383 --> 10:00:53.584

10:00:53.650 --> 10:00:55.185
GROWING HOMELESS PROP POPULATE

10:00:55.252 --> 10:00:56.887

10:00:56.954 --> 10:00:58.422
ADDICTION PROBLEM WE TALK ABOUT

10:00:58.489 --> 10:01:00.190
THE BASICALLY THE RACIAL ISSUES

IN COUNTIES AND ON AND ON AND ON.

10:01:02.292 --> 10:01:06.296
IF THEY'RE NOT GOING TO SOLVE

10:01:06.363 --> 10:01:06.930
THE PROBLEM THEN WE NEED TO LET

NUMBER OF YEARS TO ADDRESS

10:20:40.670 --> 10:20:42.972
POVERTY. IN CALIFORNIA WE PASSED

10:20:43.039 --> 10:20:45.041

THAT ACTUALLY WORK TO LIFT

10:20:51.080 --> 10:20:52.882
PEOPLE UP OUT OF POVERTY. AND

10:20:52.949 --> 10:20:54.684

RUN AWAY INTEREST RATES THAT

WE THINK WE CAN BENEFIT THE POOR

10:21:15.071 --> 10:21:16.005
AND NOT PUT STRUCTURES IN PLACE

10:21:16.072 --> 10:21:17.573

PREDATORY LENDERS BE ABLE TO

10:21:43.466 --> 10:21:45.267
