01:09:05.641 --> 01:09:07.376
REALIZATION AND- DO THIS

THE SHIPPING LINES ANNOUNCED

01:09:37.106 --> 01:09:38.073
THAT THEY WILL BE MAKING A

FIRST PORT OF CALL TO THE

01:09:40.910 --> 01:09:42.111
PORTABLE CLICKED. NOW THAT'S

01:09:42.177 --> 01:09:43.779
PART OF THE PROBLEM PUBLIC

01:09:43.846 --> 01:09:45.748
TRUST PART OF THE SOLUTION. THE

01:09:45.814 --> 01:09:48.150
SECOND AS YOU REALIZE THE

01:09:48.217 --> 01:09:49.885
LOGISTICS CHANGE NOT SHIPS WAS

01:09:49.952 --> 01:09:52.321
ALSO TRUCKS TRAINS AND BEING

01:09:52.388 --> 01:09:54.890
ABLE TO GET THESE GOODS IN AND

01:09:54.957 --> 01:09:56.926
OUT OF THE GOOD PARTS QUICKLY-

01:09:56.992 --> 01:09:59.061
THAT IS ALSO CAUSING SOME

01:09:59.128 --> 01:10:01.797
CONGESTION AS WELL. AND

01:10:01.864 --> 01:10:03.666
THEREFORE I THINK ARE REAL BILL

01:10:03.732 --> 01:10:05.701
TO STEP UP IN ORDER TO RECEIVE

01:10:05.768 --> 01:10:06.669
THOSE GOODS AND SHIPPED THEM

01:10:06.735 --> 01:10:09.104

BOTH AT THE PORT OF OAKLAND AND

01:10:13.175 --> 01:10:16.045
IN NORFOLK CALIFORNIA

01:10:16.111 --> 01:10:18.180
DESTINATIONS AS TRACY. SO I

01:10:18.247 --> 01:10:19.782
THINK WHAT THIS IS REVEALED

01:10:19.848 --> 01:10:22.284
HOWEVER. IS THAT THERE NEEDS TO

01:10:22.351 --> 01:10:24.186
BE A COORDINATED APPROACH. TO

01:10:24.253 --> 01:10:27.222
PLAN FOR GOODS MOVEMENT AND

01:10:27.289 --> 01:10:29.491
THEY JUST PICKED IN CALIFORNIA-

01:10:29.558 --> 01:10:30.893
THE WAY WE'RE DOING IT NOW IS

01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:32.895
THAT THE FOR THE FOR THE

01:10:32.962 --> 01:10:35.030
OPERATING FAIRLY INDEPENDENTLY.

01:10:35.097 --> 01:10:36.131
AND IS SOMETIMES WERE IN

01:10:36.198 --> 01:10:37.666
COMPETITION SOMETIMES WE

01:10:37.733 --> 01:10:39.668
COOPERATE BUT THESE LOGISTIC

01:10:39.735 --> 01:10:41.337
CHAINS ARE AT THE MERCY OF

01:10:41.403 --> 01:10:43.505
WORSHIPS CHOOSE THE GOAL AND

01:10:43.572 --> 01:10:45.574
WHERE DO YOU THINK IT'S GOING

01:10:45.641 --> 01:10:47.209
TO BE THE FASTEST. THEREFORE I

01:10:47.276 --> 01:10:49.678
THINK THIS CRISIS REVEALED IS

01:10:49.745 --> 01:10:51.814
THAT WE DO NEED A CALIFORNIA

01:10:51.880 --> 01:10:53.882

MAKE SURE THE GOODS FLOW WHERE

01:10:55.484 --> 01:10:56.952
THEY NEED TO BE. THE MOST

01:10:57.019 --> 01:10:58.921
EFFICIENTLY RATHER THAN WAIT

01:10:58.988 --> 01:11:00.789

01:11:00.856 --> 01:11:04.126
HAPPENED TO SHOW IT TO US. AT

01:11:04.193 --> 01:11:05.928
AND THAT IS THAT SORT OF THE

01:11:05.995 --> 01:11:07.596
LESSONS THAT WE'RE LEARNING

01:11:07.663 --> 01:11:08.530
FROM HERE AND ALSO YOU WILL

01:11:08.597 --> 01:11:10.933

AUTOMOTIVE SWITCHES EXPORT HAS

01:23:25.333 --> 01:23:26.801

TWO YEARS- FROM THESE DECLINES

01:23:42.016 --> 01:23:43.651
IN ECONOMIC SHOCKS AND THIS IS

01:23:43.718 --> 01:23:45.387
ON A BUDGET OF ONLY A HUNDRED

01:23:45.453 --> 01:23:46.588

ADDING TO ITS RECOVERY INSTEAD

01:24:40.909 --> 01:24:42.210
WE WOULD BE A DEFICIT IF WE

01:24:42.277 --> 01:24:45.079
WERE TO CUT AS EXTREMELY AS THE

01:29:03.004 --> 01:29:04.472
HAVE. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S

01:29:04.539 --> 01:29:05.306
REALLY INTERESTING IS THAT

01:29:05.373 --> 01:29:06.908
CALIFORNIA'S GOALS THE ADVANCE

01:29:06.974 --> 01:29:09.010
CLEAN TRUCK RULES ARE THAT ARE

01:29:09.077 --> 01:29:10.378
PUSHING TOWARDS GREATER CLIMATE

01:29:10.445 --> 01:29:12.180
CHANGE AND ZERO EMISSION. ARE

01:29:12.246 --> 01:29:14.215
ACTUALLY BEING ADOPTED NOT ONLY

01:29:14.282 --> 01:29:15.416
BY OTHER REGIONS OF THE UNITED

01:29:15.483 --> 01:29:17.351
STATES ABOUT THERE BEING

01:29:17.418 --> 01:29:18.653
ADOPTED BY OTHER NATIONS OF THE

01:29:18.720 --> 01:29:21.289
WORLD AND AS WE REALLY START TO

01:29:21.355 --> 01:29:24.892
SEE THIS- THIS CHANGE GOING ON

01:29:24.959 --> 01:29:26.360
IT'S SENDING A CLEAR SIGNAL TO

01:29:26.427 --> 01:29:27.595
INDUSTRY OF WERE INVESTMENTS

01:29:27.662 --> 01:29:28.696
NEED TO GO THESE ONLINE

01:29:28.763 --> 01:29:35.036
POLICIES. REALLY. A PROVIDE

01:29:35.103 --> 01:29:37.538
TREMENDOUS STRENGTH. TO AND ALL

01:29:37.605 --> 01:29:38.740
HOPEFULLY THIS IS A CHANCE TO

01:29:38.806 --> 01:29:41.008
GIVE YOU SOME OF. THESE

01:29:41.075 --> 01:29:41.609
PICTURES HERE WHAT WE'RE

01:29:41.676 --> 01:29:42.577
TALKING THIS REALLY SENSE A

01:29:42.643 --> 01:29:43.978
SIGNAL TO INDUSTRY. OF WHAT

01:29:44.045 --> 01:29:46.447
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH

01:29:46.514 --> 01:29:48.449
AND HELPS THEM FURTHER ALIGN

01:29:48.516 --> 01:29:50.151
THEIR BEST MONTH SO THAT THEY

01:29:50.218 --> 01:29:52.687
CAN MEET THE NEEDS OF THESE

01:29:52.754 --> 01:29:54.856
GOALS AS WE GO FORWARD- NOW

01:29:54.922 --> 01:29:56.190
WHERE IS THE TECHNOLOGY AND

01:29:56.257 --> 01:29:57.225
THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS I

01:29:57.291 --> 01:29:58.426
WOULD WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU

01:29:58.493 --> 01:29:59.861
TODAY AS A SENSE OF WHAT IS THE

01:29:59.927 --> 01:30:02.029
REALITY. WHAT'S MOVING FORWARD

01:30:02.096 --> 01:30:02.764
AND CAN WE MAKE THESE

01:30:02.830 --> 01:30:04.565
TECHNOLOGIES MOVE FORWARD ON

01:30:04.632 --> 01:30:07.802
THE PACE THAT WE WANT. SO I

01:30:07.869 --> 01:30:10.238
THINK- FIRST OF ALL. YOU CAN

01:30:10.304 --> 01:30:11.639
SEE A LIGHT DUTY SPACE OR THE-

01:30:11.706 --> 01:30:13.007
LOWER END OF MEDIUM AND HEAVY

01:30:13.074 --> 01:30:14.342
DUTY THE DELIVERY TRUCKS

01:30:14.408 --> 01:30:15.743
THERE'S TREMENDOUS CHANGE GOING

01:30:15.810 --> 01:30:17.779
ON BUT THIS IS ACTUALLY ALSO

01:30:17.845 --> 01:30:20.515
MOVING INTO. WHAT WE NOW VIEW

01:30:20.581 --> 01:30:22.350
AS THE HEAVIEST APPLICATIONS IN

01:30:22.416 --> 01:30:24.218
THE DRAYAGE APPLICATIONS ALL OF

01:30:24.285 --> 01:30:25.653
THESE PLATFORMS THAT YOU SEE

01:30:25.720 --> 01:30:26.988
HERE IS OR ACTUALLY IN EARLY

01:30:27.054 --> 01:30:28.790
PRODUCTION. OR ABOUT TO MOVE

01:30:28.856 --> 01:30:30.458
INTO PRODUCTION. TO A GREAT

01:30:30.525 --> 01:30:32.059
EXTENT BECAUSE OF CALIFORNIA'S

01:30:32.126 --> 01:30:33.427
INVESTMENTS AND BECAUSE OF THE

01:30:33.494 --> 01:30:35.663
PARTNERSHIP SUPPORTS. THREE

01:30:35.730 --> 01:30:36.964
OPERATORS AND FLEETS IN THE

01:30:37.031 --> 01:30:37.865
STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE'RE

01:30:37.932 --> 01:30:39.867
SEEING. THE ZERO EMISSION

01:30:39.934 --> 01:30:42.937
TECHNOLOGIES MOVE FORWARD AT A

01:30:43.004 --> 01:30:44.872
PHENOMENAL PACE. WELL WE DO

01:30:44.939 --> 01:30:46.741
ALSO NEED TO TAKE A STEP BACK

01:30:46.808 --> 01:30:48.409
THAT'S WHAT'S POSSIBLE AND

01:30:48.476 --> 01:30:49.710
WHAT'S MOVING FORWARD BUT WE

01:30:49.777 --> 01:30:50.912
REALLY DO NEED TO LOOK AT WHAT

01:30:50.978 --> 01:30:52.880
CAN WE DO NOW. AND THEN WHAT

01:30:52.947 --> 01:30:54.715
CAN WE DO AS WE MOVE TO WHERE

01:30:54.782 --> 01:30:57.118
WE NEED TO BE IN TWENTY THIRTY

01:30:57.185 --> 01:30:58.252
TO TWENTY THIRTY FIVE. WE DO

01:30:58.319 --> 01:30:59.520
KNOW THAT ALL THE TECHNOLOGIES

01:30:59.587 --> 01:31:01.389
THAT SERVICE OUR PORTS AND OUR

01:31:01.455 --> 01:31:03.424
REGIONS NEED TO BOTH ADDRESS

01:31:03.491 --> 01:31:04.892
CRITERION PENSIONS OR THINGS

01:31:04.959 --> 01:31:07.094
THAT CAUSE SMOG. AND CLIMATE

01:31:07.161 --> 01:31:08.229
EMISSIONS AND THEY NEED TO DO

01:31:08.296 --> 01:31:09.297
IT AT THE SAME TIME THIS IS THE

01:31:09.363 --> 01:31:10.631
MOST DIFFICULT THING THAT WE

01:31:10.698 --> 01:31:12.500
HAVE FACED IN A LONG TIME. NOW

01:31:12.567 --> 01:31:13.501
IN TERMS OF TECHNOLOGY

01:31:13.568 --> 01:31:14.602
READINESS WE KNOW THAT LOW

01:31:14.669 --> 01:31:16.437
EMISSION TECHNOLOGIES SOME

01:31:16.504 --> 01:31:18.773
PEOPLE CALL THOSE- NEAR ZERO

01:31:18.840 --> 01:31:20.541
SUCH AS NATURAL GAS LOW KNOCKS

01:31:20.608 --> 01:31:22.210
TRUCKS OR PROPANE. THEY ARE

01:31:22.276 --> 01:31:23.878
READY NOW AS WE'VE DONE THESE

01:31:23.945 --> 01:31:25.746
TECHNOLOGY ANALYSES OF

01:31:25.813 --> 01:31:27.348
READINESS FOR THE AIR RESOURCES

01:31:27.415 --> 01:31:28.850
BOARD ANOTHER PARTNERS AS YOU

01:31:28.916 --> 01:31:29.951
CAN SEE KIND OF WHERE THEIR

01:31:30.017 --> 01:31:31.819
CIRCLES ARE IN THE CRAFT. THERE

01:31:31.886 --> 01:31:33.120
AT THE COMMERCIAL STAGE AND

01:31:33.187 --> 01:31:35.122
THEY ARE DEFINITELY READY TO

01:31:35.189 --> 01:31:36.958
FOR ACTION. BUT WE ALSO NEED TO

01:31:37.024 --> 01:31:38.860
BE VERY AWARE OF WHAT'S COMING

01:31:38.926 --> 01:31:40.728
DOWN THE PIKE NEXT. AND WHEN IT

01:31:40.795 --> 01:31:41.662
COMES TO ZERO EMISSIONS

01:31:41.729 --> 01:31:43.164
TECHNOLOGIES THEY WERE CLOSE

01:31:43.231 --> 01:31:44.999
BEHIND. THESE TECHNOLOGIES ARE

01:31:45.066 --> 01:31:47.134
MOVING FROM PILOT STAGE INTO

01:31:47.201 --> 01:31:48.436
THE EARLY COMMERCIAL STAGE OF

01:31:48.502 --> 01:31:50.238
MANUFACTURING INCLUDING IN

01:31:50.304 --> 01:31:52.039
DRAINAGE. AND REGIONAL HEAVY

01:31:52.106 --> 01:31:54.442
HAUL APPLICATIONS SO A LOT OF

01:31:54.508 --> 01:31:56.043
PEOPLE DO ASK CAN WE SHOULD THE

01:31:56.110 --> 01:31:57.411
SALES GOALS THAT HAVE BEEN LAID

01:31:57.478 --> 01:31:58.980
OUT BY THE STATE IN A C. T. IN

01:31:59.046 --> 01:32:00.815
THE GOVERNOR'S SCHOOLS FOR

01:32:00.882 --> 01:32:01.449
TWENTY THIRTY FIVE AT THE PORT

01:32:01.515 --> 01:32:03.484
SCHOOLS. IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA

01:32:03.551 --> 01:32:04.652
FOR ZERO EMISSIONS. AND THE

01:32:04.719 --> 01:32:07.154
SHORT ANSWER IS YES ABSOLUTELY

01:32:07.221 --> 01:32:08.856
WE CAN'T THE TECHNOLOGY IS ON

01:32:08.923 --> 01:32:11.525
THE PATH TO DO THAT. AND AS WE

01:32:11.592 --> 01:32:12.860
LOOK AT THAT PHASING FOR THAT

01:32:12.927 --> 01:32:14.128
TRANSITION WE CAN SEE. THE

01:32:14.195 --> 01:32:15.463
RAPID DEVELOPMENT OF THE

01:32:15.529 --> 01:32:17.231
TECHNOLOGY INTO THEY HAVE A

01:32:17.298 --> 01:32:19.100
STEP WITH PATIENTS AND INDEED.

01:32:19.166 --> 01:32:21.335
WE WILL BE SAYING A LONGER AND

01:32:21.402 --> 01:32:23.471
LONG HAUL TRUCKS. ZERO

01:32:23.537 --> 01:32:25.172
EMISSIONS- AT LEAST THE FIRST

01:32:25.239 --> 01:32:32.146
APPLICATIONS OF THOSE BY THE.

01:32:32.213 --> 01:32:32.747
TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR TIME

01:32:32.813 --> 01:32:34.215
FOR IT. AND AS WE WHAT. KIND OF

01:32:34.282 --> 01:32:35.416
MEASURE THE NUMBERS OF MODELS

01:32:35.483 --> 01:32:36.183
COMING INTO MARKET PLACE BOTH

01:32:36.250 --> 01:32:36.884
TODAY AND IN THE- WE- THE

01:32:36.951 --> 01:32:39.120
NUMBER OF MODELS BEING-

01:32:39.186 --> 01:32:40.922
AVAILABLE. IN MEDIUM AND HEAVY

01:32:40.988 --> 01:32:44.058
DUTY TRUCKS DOUBLING BY TWENTY

01:32:44.125 --> 01:32:44.558
TWENTY THREE SO IT IS AN

01:32:44.625 --> 01:32:46.260
EXCITING TIME THE TECHNOLOGY IS

01:32:46.327 --> 01:32:48.296
MOVING. WE'RE MOVING IN THE

01:32:48.362 --> 01:32:50.264
RIGHT DIRECTION. HAVING SAID

01:32:50.331 --> 01:32:52.133
THAT AND I HEARD WHAT WAS

01:32:52.199 --> 01:32:53.801
EARLIER SAID BUT CHERYL DONALD

01:32:53.868 --> 01:32:55.303
I REALLY RESPECT THAT.

01:32:55.369 --> 01:32:56.771
INFRASTRUCTURE IS ONE OF OUR

01:32:56.837 --> 01:32:58.739
BIG LIPS WE ARE SEEING THE

01:32:58.806 --> 01:33:00.875
TECHNOLOGY MOVES FORWARD THE

01:33:00.942 --> 01:33:02.276
VEHICLES WILL BE THERE THE

01:33:02.343 --> 01:33:03.644
BUSINESS CASE IS ACTUALLY

01:33:03.711 --> 01:33:05.379
STARTED TO SHOW ITSELF.IN THE

01:33:05.446 --> 01:33:06.881
TOTAL COST OF OWNERSHIP THESE

01:33:06.948 --> 01:33:07.949
ARE GOING TO BE CHEAPER TO

01:33:08.015 --> 01:33:10.084
OPERATE VEHICLES. HOWEVER WE DO

01:33:10.151 --> 01:33:11.385
NEED TO GET AHEAD OF THE CURVE

01:33:11.452 --> 01:33:12.720
WHEN IT COMES TO INSTALLING THE

01:33:12.787 --> 01:33:14.455
INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE FUELING.

01:33:14.522 --> 01:33:16.857
TO SUPPORT THE- AS WE LOOK AT

01:33:16.924 --> 01:33:17.892
THIS WE'RE GOING TO SEE DEPOT

01:33:17.959 --> 01:33:19.560
CHARGING BEING THE FIRST

01:33:19.627 --> 01:33:21.963
PRIMARY- CHARGING THAT WE WILL

01:33:22.029 --> 01:33:23.597
NEED HOWEVER. WE WILL NEED TO

01:33:23.664 --> 01:33:25.333
HAVE REGIONAL FAST CHARGE HOPES

01:33:25.399 --> 01:33:27.068
TO MAKE SURE THAT TRADE TRUCKS

01:33:27.134 --> 01:33:28.369
NO MATTER WHERE THEY ARE AT

01:33:28.436 --> 01:33:29.704
THEIR CYCLE WILL ALWAYS BE

01:33:29.770 --> 01:33:31.105
CLOSE TO A PLACE TO TOP UP

01:33:31.172 --> 01:33:32.940
WHETHER THAT'S- HYDROGEN

01:33:33.007 --> 01:33:35.009
WHETHER THAT'S ELECTRICITY OR-

01:33:35.076 --> 01:33:36.911
FIVE NATURAL GAS. WE ALSO WILL

01:33:36.978 --> 01:33:38.746
NAY CORD OR BASED ON A FUNDING

01:33:38.813 --> 01:33:39.947
SO THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY GET

01:33:40.014 --> 01:33:41.716
THESE LONG HAUL TRUCKS OUT ON

01:33:41.782 --> 01:33:42.683
THE ROAD AS THEY BECOME

01:33:42.750 --> 01:33:44.652
AVAILABLE. REALLY IN JUST THE

01:33:44.719 --> 01:33:46.554
NEXT FEW YEARS. SO THAT WE CAN

01:33:46.620 --> 01:33:49.623
BE LEANING TOWARDS OUR OUTCOME

01:33:49.690 --> 01:33:50.358
OF TWENTY THIRTY FIVE. SO WHEN

01:33:50.424 --> 01:33:51.926
IT COMES TO WHAT WE WOULD SEE

01:33:51.993 --> 01:33:53.427
IS NEEDED TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:33:53.494 --> 01:33:55.229
CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO MEET.

01:33:55.296 --> 01:33:57.331
ITS THE GOALS OF KEEPING ITS

01:33:57.398 --> 01:33:59.300
PORTS ACTIVE ITS GOODS MOVEMENT

01:33:59.367 --> 01:34:00.468
TO COMPETITIVE AROUND THE

01:34:00.534 --> 01:34:02.036
WORLD. WE WILL LOOK AT ALL

01:34:02.103 --> 01:34:04.005
HANDS ON DECK APPROACH HE

01:34:04.071 --> 01:34:05.740
STATE NEEDS TO BE A STRONG AND

01:34:05.806 --> 01:34:07.742
AGGRESSIVE PARTNER. NOT JUST ON

01:34:07.808 --> 01:34:09.343
THE REGULATORY SIDE WHICH IS

01:34:09.410 --> 01:34:11.045
NECESSARY TO SEND SIGNALS. BUT

01:34:11.112 --> 01:34:13.681
THEN ON THE INCENTIVE SIDE. ON

01:34:13.748 --> 01:34:14.482
THE INVESTMENT SIDE FOR

01:34:14.548 --> 01:34:16.183
INFRASTRUCTURE. ON REALLY

01:34:16.250 --> 01:34:18.219
SETTING IN PLACE PILOT PROGRAMS

01:34:18.285 --> 01:34:19.353
THAT HAVE GREATLY HELPED

01:34:19.420 --> 01:34:22.089
FLEETS. UTILITIES AND PORTS

01:34:22.156 --> 01:34:23.958
WORK AND HOW TO GET TO SCALE

01:34:24.025 --> 01:34:25.926
FASTER. BUT WE NEED TO BE MORE

01:34:25.993 --> 01:34:27.061
INNOVATIVE AND ADDITIONAL

01:34:27.128 --> 01:34:28.329
REGULATIONS THAT CAN BRING

01:34:28.396 --> 01:34:30.064
INDUCEMENTS AND BENEFITS INTO

01:34:30.131 --> 01:34:32.433
THE MARKET PLACE- AND THEN WE

01:34:32.500 --> 01:34:33.667
NEED ALL OF THESE OTHER PLAYERS

01:34:33.734 --> 01:34:35.236
CITIES UTILITIES AND FLEETS.

01:34:35.302 --> 01:34:39.273
ARE TO TAKE THEIR PART TO BE

01:34:39.340 --> 01:34:39.874
ABLE TO MAKE THIS ACTIVE RAMP

01:34:39.940 --> 01:34:41.475
UP. SO WITH THAT I WILL. I WILL

01:34:41.542 --> 01:34:44.145
STOP WELL MY PRESENTATION- BUT

01:34:44.211 --> 01:34:46.313
I THINK WE ARE AT AN EXCITING

01:34:46.380 --> 01:34:48.716
TIME. AND THE STATE IS POISED

01:34:48.783 --> 01:34:50.184
TO LEAD THE WORLD OTHERS ARE

01:34:50.251 --> 01:34:51.352
DOING THE SAME THING BUT

01:34:51.419 --> 01:34:52.753
CALIFORNIA'S STILL IS ON THE

01:34:52.820 --> 01:34:54.722
LEADING EDGE LET'S CHANGE. AND

01:34:54.789 --> 01:34:56.090
I WILL SAY AND THERE IS DEBATE

01:34:56.157 --> 01:34:57.491
ON THIS POINT BUT I TRULY

01:34:57.558 --> 01:34:58.626
BELIEVE THIS WILL MAKE OUR

01:34:58.692 --> 01:35:00.828
PORTS MORE COMPETITIVE. BECAUSE

01:35:00.895 --> 01:35:01.829
WHAT WE'RE DOING NOW IS WHAT

01:35:01.896 --> 01:35:03.397
THE REST OF THE WORLD WILL BE

01:35:03.464 --> 01:35:05.032
TO DO. AND WE'LL GET THEIR

01:35:05.099 --> 01:35:06.467
FIRST AND HAVE THE EXPERTISE TO

01:35:06.534 --> 01:35:07.935
LEAD. SO WITH THAT THANK YOU

01:35:08.002 --> 01:35:10.671
CHAIR OF DONALD AND- THAT IS MY

01:35:10.738 --> 01:35:12.039
TESTIMONY. THANK YOU MISTER

01:35:12.106 --> 01:35:13.908
ENAMORED BY RESPONDING TO MANY

01:35:13.974 --> 01:35:15.142
OF THESE REGULATIONS WITH

01:35:15.209 --> 01:35:16.577

01:39:06.340 --> 01:39:11.412
THOSE REGULATIONS BUT ALSO. I

01:39:11.478 --> 01:39:12.613
THINK REFLECTIVE OF. IT'S WHICH

GLOBAL CONTEXT. IF YOU ARE

01:43:04.511 --> 01:43:07.915
DIVERTING CARGO. YOU ARE

01:43:07.981 --> 01:43:10.817
INCREASING GHGS THAT'S THE LAST

01:43:10.884 --> 01:43:12.319
THING YOU WANT TO DO IS HAVE

01:43:12.386 --> 01:43:15.455
CARGO BY. FOR A REPEAT AND GULF

01:43:15.522 --> 01:43:17.724
COAST PORTS. OUR STUDY IS THAT

01:43:17.791 --> 01:43:20.093
IT WOULD- INCREASE EMISSIONS BY%

01:43:20.160 --> 01:43:22.162
20% ON AVERAGE AND SINCE TWO

01:43:22.229 --> 01:43:24.765
THOUSAND SIX. THAT'S FIVE

01:43:24.831 --> 01:43:25.365
HUNDRED THOUSAND METRIC TONNES

01:43:25.432 --> 01:43:27.434
OF GHG EMISSIONS- THAT GOES

01:43:27.501 --> 01:43:29.636
BACKWARDS THAT IS NOT IN THE

01:43:29.703 --> 01:43:31.605
STATE'S GOALS. HANDED CERTAINLY

01:43:31.672 --> 01:43:33.140
DOES NOT CORRELATE WITH WHAT WE

01:43:33.206 --> 01:43:34.708
WANT TO HAVE HAPPEN ON THE ON

01:43:34.775 --> 01:43:36.677
THE BUSINESS SIDE EITHER SO WE

01:43:36.743 --> 01:43:38.712
REALLY APPRECIATE- THE HEARING

01:43:38.779 --> 01:43:42.049
AND- OUR OUR FOR A POLICY OF

01:43:42.115 --> 01:43:43.417
THIS PAST YEAR WILL BE TALKING

01:43:43.483 --> 01:43:44.952
ABOUT REALLY IS ABOUT HOW DO WE

01:43:45.018 --> 01:43:46.086
ALIGN PUBLIC FUNDING

01:43:46.153 --> 01:43:48.755
INVESTMENTS TO SUPPORT LONG.

01:43:48.822 --> 01:43:50.657
TERM REMISSIONS IN NEAR ZERO.

01:43:50.724 --> 01:43:52.259
TRANSITIONS AND HOW DO WE

01:43:52.326 --> 01:43:53.961
PRIORITIZE FLEXIBLE COMPLIANCE

01:43:54.027 --> 01:43:55.495
OPTIONS AND SENATE FUNDING

01:43:55.562 --> 01:43:58.532

ARE ASKED TO CONSIDER SOME

01:44:40.641 --> 01:44:42.409
QUESTIONS. WHAT IS THE ROLE OF

01:44:42.476 --> 01:44:43.710
TRUCKING IN CONTRIBUTING TO

01:44:43.777 --> 01:44:45.379
GREEN PARKS AND GREEN A GREEN

STATE'S ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS

01:44:48.582 --> 01:44:49.783
WHAT ARE THE HURDLES AND WHAT

01:44:49.850 --> 01:44:50.751
SUPPORT IS NEEDED FROM THE

01:44:50.817 --> 01:44:52.419
STATE. TO THE FIRST QUESTION

01:44:52.486 --> 01:44:53.353
ABOUT TRUCKING IS ROLE IN

TO CLEANING THE YEAR. INCLUDED

01:45:02.896 --> 01:45:03.897
IN THE COMMITTEE PACKETS ARE

01:45:03.964 --> 01:45:05.032
THE LATEST EMISSION REDUCTION

01:45:05.098 --> 01:45:06.133
NUMBERS FROM THE PORT OF LOS

01:45:06.199 --> 01:45:08.035
ANGELES FOR TWENTY NINETEEN AND

01:45:08.101 --> 01:45:09.136
I THINK MISTER JACOB COVERED

01:45:09.202 --> 01:45:11.104
SOME OF THIS ALREADY BUT-

01:45:11.171 --> 01:45:12.139
THROUGH ABOUT. ONE BILLION

01:45:12.205 --> 01:45:13.907
DOLLARS IN INDUSTRY INVESTMENT

01:45:13.974 --> 01:45:15.175
DIESEL PARTICULATE EMISSIONS

01:45:15.242 --> 01:45:17.010
FROM PORT TRUCKING. WHICH IS

01:45:17.077 --> 01:45:18.345
THE POLLUTANT OF CONCERN FOR

01:45:18.412 --> 01:45:19.946
LOCALIZED HEALTH IMPACT HAVE

01:45:20.013 --> 01:45:21.581
BEEN REDUCED BY NINETY SEVEN

01:45:21.648 --> 01:45:23.784
PERCENT. NITROGEN OXIDES WHICH

01:45:23.850 --> 01:45:25.085
CONTRIBUTE TO REGIONAL OZONE

01:45:25.152 --> 01:45:27.721
LEVELS AND SMOG. HAVE FALLEN BY

01:45:27.788 --> 01:45:28.822
SEVENTY EIGHT PERCENT. THESE

01:45:28.889 --> 01:45:31.425
EMISSIONS WILL AGAIN FALL IN

01:45:31.491 --> 01:45:31.992
TWENTY TWENTY THREE ONCE THE

01:45:32.059 --> 01:45:33.193
STATE AIR BOARD STATEWIDE RULES

01:45:33.260 --> 01:45:35.429
ARE FULLY PHASED IN. SO WHILE

01:45:35.495 --> 01:45:37.130
EMISSIONS ARE DOWN ACROSS OLD

01:45:37.197 --> 01:45:38.432
PORT RELATED EQUIPMENT AND I

01:45:38.498 --> 01:45:39.933
GOT TO GIVE COMPLIMENTS TO ALL

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:41.702
OF OUR PORT PARTNERS OF FOR

01:45:41.768 --> 01:45:43.170
THAT. QUITE LITERALLY NO

01:45:43.236 --> 01:45:44.237
SEGMENT OF THE INDUSTRY HAS

01:45:44.304 --> 01:45:45.605
DONE MORE TO REDUCE THESE

01:45:45.672 --> 01:45:47.641
POLLUTANTS AND TRUCKING. AS WE

01:45:47.708 --> 01:45:48.909
MOVE FORWARD YOU CAN EXPECT

01:45:48.975 --> 01:45:51.244
TRUCKS TO GET EVEN CLEANER IS-

01:45:51.311 --> 01:45:53.580
CARBON BOTH FEDERAL EPA- LOOK

01:45:53.647 --> 01:45:55.482
TO ADOPT A NEW LOWER KNOCKS

01:45:55.549 --> 01:45:56.883
STANDARDS TO GET TO THAT VERY

01:45:56.950 --> 01:45:58.785
FINAL INCREMENTS. OF THOSE

01:45:58.852 --> 01:46:01.755
KNOCKS- SMOG FORMING EMISSIONS.

01:46:01.822 --> 01:46:03.523
A CARD DATA ALSO SUGGESTS THAT

01:46:03.590 --> 01:46:05.625
GROSS EMITTERS MAKING UP JUST

01:46:05.692 --> 01:46:07.127
3% OF TRUCKS ON THE ROAD

01:46:07.194 --> 01:46:09.696
CONTRIBUTES 65% OF ALL.

01:46:09.763 --> 01:46:10.931
PARTICULATE EMISSIONS AND SO I

01:46:10.997 --> 01:46:12.065
WANT TO REPEAT THAT DOESN'T

01:46:12.132 --> 01:46:14.468
HAVE A STAKE. 3% OF ALL TRUCKS

01:46:14.534 --> 01:46:15.669
ON THE ROAD- DUE IN ABOUT TWO

01:46:15.736 --> 01:46:17.537
THIRDS OF ALL THE EMISSIONS. SO

01:46:17.604 --> 01:46:19.639
IF YOU SEE A SMOKING TRUCK. IS

01:46:19.706 --> 01:46:20.841
LIKELY EITHER NOT COMPLIANT

01:46:20.907 --> 01:46:22.542
WITH STATE REGULATIONS IS

01:46:22.609 --> 01:46:24.077
SEVERELY MALFUNCTIONING OR HAS

01:46:24.144 --> 01:46:25.145
BEEN INTENTIONALLY TAMPERED

01:46:25.212 --> 01:46:26.813
WITH SO. IF YOU GET THOSE

01:46:26.880 --> 01:46:27.848
CONSIDERING COMPLAINTS ABOUT

01:46:27.914 --> 01:46:29.149
SMOKING TRUCKS THAT THOSE ARE

01:46:29.216 --> 01:46:30.917
NOT PROPERLY FUNCTIONING.

01:46:30.984 --> 01:46:31.952
TRUCKS WITH FUNCTIONING

01:46:32.018 --> 01:46:33.353
EMISSION CONTROL SYSTEMS TO

01:46:33.420 --> 01:46:35.122
QUOTE THE A RESOURCES BOARD.

01:46:35.188 --> 01:46:36.423
VIRTUALLY ELIMINATE DIESEL

01:46:36.490 --> 01:46:38.425
PARTICULATES. DELETE BETWEEN A

01:46:38.492 --> 01:46:40.260
GROSS EMITTING A TRUCK IN A

01:46:40.327 --> 01:46:41.328
CLEAN ONE IS ACTUALLY

01:46:41.394 --> 01:46:43.130
SIGNIFICANT LARK SIGNIFICANTLY

01:46:43.196 --> 01:46:45.398
LARGER. THAN MOVING FROM A

01:46:45.465 --> 01:46:47.768
CLEAN DIESEL TO ELECTRIC. D. D.

01:46:47.834 --> 01:46:49.669
CLEANER DIESELS ARE SO MUCH.

01:46:49.736 --> 01:46:51.004
BETTER THAN ONE WHICH IS

01:46:51.071 --> 01:46:52.472
AGGRESSIVE MALFUNCTIONING THAT

01:46:52.539 --> 01:46:54.241
THAT IS THE BIGGEST BANG FOR

01:46:54.307 --> 01:46:54.875
THE BUCK RATHER THAN MOVING TO

01:46:54.941 --> 01:46:56.810
ELECTRIC. AND SO WE'RE WORKING

01:46:56.877 --> 01:46:58.078
WITH THE RESOURCES BOARD ON

01:46:58.145 --> 01:46:59.312
PROGRAMS TO IDENTIFY AND

01:46:59.379 --> 01:47:02.916
ADDRESS THESE GROSS EMITTERS

01:47:02.983 --> 01:47:03.483
WITHOUT OVER BURDENING. THE

01:47:03.550 --> 01:47:04.084
VA'S MAJORITY OF TRUCK OWNERS

01:47:04.151 --> 01:47:05.385
WHO ARE PERSON COMPLY IN GOING

01:47:05.452 --> 01:47:06.920
ABOUT THEIR- THEIR BUSINESS IN

01:47:06.987 --> 01:47:08.789
THE RIGHT WAY. BUT AS WE KNOW

01:47:08.855 --> 01:47:10.023
AND HAVE DISCUSSED TODAY THE

01:47:10.090 --> 01:47:11.158
GOAL OF THE STATE IS TO

01:47:11.224 --> 01:47:12.726
TRANSITION A SPECIFICALLY PORT

01:47:12.793 --> 01:47:14.227
DRAYAGE TRUCKS ZERO EMISSION BY

01:47:14.294 --> 01:47:15.996
THE YEAR TWENTY THIRTY FIVE.

01:47:16.062 --> 01:47:17.264
AND AS WE LOOK TOWARDS THE

01:47:17.330 --> 01:47:18.532
TRANSITION TO ZERO EMISSION

01:47:18.598 --> 01:47:19.733
TRUCKS THERE'S A MAJOR HURDLES

01:47:19.800 --> 01:47:21.568
THAT ALL BREAK INTO FOUR

01:47:21.635 --> 01:47:24.371
CATEGORIES. COST WEIGHT RANGE

01:47:24.437 --> 01:47:27.007
AND INFRASTRUCTURE. FOR COST

01:47:27.073 --> 01:47:28.241
ZERO EMISSION TRUCKS COST

01:47:28.308 --> 01:47:29.876
APPROXIMATELY TWO TO THREE

01:47:29.943 --> 01:47:31.144
TIMES MORE THAN THEIR DIESEL

01:47:31.211 --> 01:47:32.846
COUNTERPARTS A BRAND NEW DIESEL

01:47:32.913 --> 01:47:36.049
TRUCK COSTS. ANYWHERE FROM A

01:47:36.116 --> 01:47:36.583
HUNDRED THIRTY TWO HUNDRED

01:47:36.650 --> 01:47:37.184
FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. ZERO

01:47:37.250 --> 01:47:38.418
EMISSION TRUCKS ARE GOING TO BE

01:47:38.485 --> 01:47:40.453
QUITE A BIT MORE EXPENSIVE. AND

01:47:40.520 --> 01:47:41.788
I DO WANNA AGREE WITH MR VAN

01:47:41.855 --> 01:47:44.391
AMBURG THERE ARE POSSIBLE- COST

01:47:44.457 --> 01:47:45.392
SAVINGS FROM OPERATIONS AND

01:47:45.458 --> 01:47:47.227
MAINTENANCE THERE FOR FEWER

01:47:47.294 --> 01:47:48.929
MOVING PARTS. GENERALLY

01:47:48.995 --> 01:47:49.963
SPEAKING ELECTRICITY IS MORE

01:47:50.030 --> 01:47:52.399
CHEAP. BUT WE STILL REALLY

01:47:52.465 --> 01:47:53.667
DON'T HAVE REAL WORLD

01:47:53.733 --> 01:47:55.735
EXPERIENCE WITH THOSE SAVINGS-

01:47:55.802 --> 01:47:57.838
THEY CAN WEIGH AS MUCH AS SIX

01:47:57.904 --> 01:47:58.939
TO EIGHT THOUSAND POUNDS MORE

01:47:59.005 --> 01:48:00.340
THAN A DIESEL TRUCK THAT IS A

01:48:00.407 --> 01:48:01.508
SIGNIFICANT ISSUE WHEN IT COMES

01:48:01.575 --> 01:48:03.043
TO. YOU'RE PROBABLY GONNA HAVE

01:48:03.109 --> 01:48:04.344
TO HAVE MORE TRUCKS TO MOVE THE

01:48:04.411 --> 01:48:06.513
SAME AMOUNT OF CARGO- THE RANGE

01:48:06.580 --> 01:48:08.415
IS LIMITED TO ABOUT A HUNDRED

01:48:08.481 --> 01:48:08.915
FIFTY MILES PER CHARGE

01:48:08.982 --> 01:48:10.417
DEPENDING ON THE SIZE OF THE

01:48:10.483 --> 01:48:12.085
BATTERY PACK. NOT EXACTLY

01:48:12.152 --> 01:48:13.687
SUITABLE FOR LONGER RANGE

01:48:13.753 --> 01:48:15.355
FALLS. AND FINALLY THE

01:48:15.422 --> 01:48:17.891
INFRASTRUCTURE TO CHARGING FUEL

01:48:17.958 --> 01:48:18.458
THESE TRUCKS IN THE CASE OF

01:48:18.525 --> 01:48:20.594
HYDROGEN. IS NEARLY NONEXISTENT

01:48:20.660 --> 01:48:21.761
WERE REALLY STARTING FROM THE

01:48:21.828 --> 01:48:23.530
GROUND LEVEL OP. AND I CAN TELL

01:48:23.597 --> 01:48:25.498
YOU THAT- ISSUES PERTAINING TO

01:48:25.565 --> 01:48:27.300
INFRASTRUCTURE ARE GOING TO BE.

01:48:27.367 --> 01:48:29.803
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. VERY SITE

01:48:29.870 --> 01:48:30.637
SPECIFIC THERE'S NO

01:48:30.704 --> 01:48:32.372
GENERALIZATION ABOUT HOW EASY

01:48:32.439 --> 01:48:33.073
IT IS TO INSTALL

01:48:33.139 --> 01:48:34.875
INFRASTRUCTURE. JUST HEARD FOR

01:48:34.941 --> 01:48:36.176
THE FIRST TIME THAT YOU KNOW IF

01:48:36.243 --> 01:48:37.844
A NEW SUBSTATION UPGRADE IS

01:48:37.911 --> 01:48:39.512
REQUIRED FOR ONE OF THE SITES.

01:48:39.579 --> 01:48:41.181
THAT COULD BE AS MUCH AS A FIVE

01:48:41.248 --> 01:48:41.848
TO SEVEN YEAR PROCESS FIRST

01:48:41.915 --> 01:48:43.250
TIMER HEARD HAD ABOUT A MONTH

01:48:43.316 --> 01:48:46.219
AGO SO. A VERY COMPLICATED. AB

01:48:46.286 --> 01:48:47.587
GIVEN THESE CHALLENGES THE BEST

01:48:47.654 --> 01:48:48.889
USE CASE AND I THINK I'M

01:48:48.955 --> 01:48:50.790
AGREEING. WITH MR VAN AMBURG ON

01:48:50.857 --> 01:48:52.492
THIS- FOR TODAY'S REMISSION

01:48:52.559 --> 01:48:54.728
TRUCKS. ARE REALLY LOCAL HALL

01:48:54.794 --> 01:48:56.263
SMALLER CLASS TRUCKS. WERE

01:48:56.329 --> 01:48:58.431
WEIGHT IS NOT AN ISSUE. ARE YOU

01:48:58.498 --> 01:48:59.766
OPERATE ON A RELATIVELY FIXED

01:48:59.833 --> 01:49:03.103
ROUTE WITHIN LIMITED RANGES YOU

01:49:03.169 --> 01:49:03.703
CAN USE A SMALLER AND SHE PER

01:49:03.770 --> 01:49:05.005
BATTERY. AND YOU CAN SENSE YOUR

01:49:05.071 --> 01:49:06.406
DEPOT CHARGE OVERNIGHT IN ONE

01:49:06.473 --> 01:49:09.342
LOCATION- TO AVOID A TIME USE

01:49:09.409 --> 01:49:10.710
AND DEMAND CHARGES YOU REALLY

01:49:10.777 --> 01:49:12.279
WANT TO CENTRALLY CHARGE VERY

01:49:12.345 --> 01:49:14.514
SLOWLY. AT A TIME WHERE YOU'RE

01:49:14.581 --> 01:49:15.048
NOT GONNA BE PENALIZED FOR

01:49:15.115 --> 01:49:16.850
DOING SO. YOU KNOW QUITE

01:49:16.917 --> 01:49:18.752
FRANKLY PORT DRAYAGE IS NOT

01:49:18.818 --> 01:49:21.021
NECESSARILY THIS BEST USE CASE.

01:49:21.087 --> 01:49:22.822
IN THE EARLY YEARS OF THIS

01:49:22.889 --> 01:49:24.357
WE'RE LIKELY LOOKING AT A

01:49:24.424 --> 01:49:26.426
SMALLER SUBSET OF DRAYAGE WORK

01:49:26.493 --> 01:49:28.128
WHICH IS GOING TO BE SUITABLE.

01:49:28.194 --> 01:49:29.195
FOR THE TECHNOLOGIES WE KNOW IT

01:49:29.262 --> 01:49:31.298
TODAY. AND EVEN THEN INDUSTRY

01:49:31.364 --> 01:49:32.499
IS GOING TO NEED SIGNIFICANT

01:49:32.565 --> 01:49:34.234
SUPPORT FROM THE STATE.

01:49:34.301 --> 01:49:35.835
RESOURCES BOARD ESTIMATES IT

01:49:35.902 --> 01:49:37.003
NEEDS ABOUT THREE BILLION

01:49:37.070 --> 01:49:38.972
DOLLARS A YEAR TO ACCOMPLISH

01:49:39.039 --> 01:49:39.973
ITS TRUCK ELECTRIFICATION

01:49:40.040 --> 01:49:41.975
GOALS. THE GOVERNOR'S CURRENT

01:49:42.042 --> 01:49:43.677
BUDGET PROPOSAL WOULD PROVIDE

01:49:43.743 --> 01:49:44.344
ABOUT THREE HUNDRED MILLION

01:49:44.411 --> 01:49:45.478
DOLLARS THIS YEAR SO THERE'S A

01:49:45.545 --> 01:49:47.614
SIGNIFICANT GAP- THIS

01:49:47.681 --> 01:49:48.548
UNDERSCORES THE NEED TO RE

01:49:48.615 --> 01:49:50.483
AUTHORIZE EXISTING INCENTIVE

01:49:50.550 --> 01:49:51.785

SALES TAX CREDITS FINANCING

01:49:57.424 --> 01:49:59.259
MECHANISMS I THINK THAT THE

01:49:59.326 --> 01:50:01.227
TERM WAS USE ALL HADS ON DECK.

01:50:01.294 --> 01:50:02.629
THE STATE MUST EMPLOY EVERY%

01:50:02.696 --> 01:50:04.297
TOOL AT ITS DISPOSAL IF IT IS

01:50:04.364 --> 01:50:05.231
SERIOUS ABOUT ACCOMPLISHING

01:50:05.298 --> 01:50:07.067
THESE GOALS. AND THE TIMELINE

01:50:07.133 --> 01:50:08.868
SET OUT. IN EVEN WITHOUT

CHAIRMAN. AND TO ALL THE

02:09:43.642 --> 02:09:46.044
PRESENTERS FOR BEING HERE. I

02:09:46.111 --> 02:09:47.880
DON'T KNOW OF GENES- IS STILL

02:09:47.946 --> 02:09:49.781
IS STILL HERE BUT I JUST HAVE

02:09:49.848 --> 02:09:52.618
ONE QUESTION- WHAT ACTIONS OR

02:09:52.684 --> 02:09:55.020
LEGISLATION CAN THE STATE WORK

02:09:55.087 --> 02:09:57.589
ON TO GET. THE PORTS BACK ON

02:09:57.656 --> 02:10:00.292
TRACK POST CODE EX NINETEEN. I

02:10:00.359 --> 02:10:02.194
THINK WE SHOULD FIGURE OUT.

02:10:02.261 --> 02:10:05.130
WHAT THAT PLAN SHOULD BE AS- A

02:10:05.197 --> 02:10:06.131
TERMINAL DIAL INDICATED THERE

02:10:06.198 --> 02:10:08.167
IS A LOT OF. VESSELS THAT

02:10:08.233 --> 02:10:10.802
AWAITING- IN WATERS TO TRY TO

02:10:10.869 --> 02:10:12.638
GET IN WHAT IT WHAT SHOULD WE

02:10:12.704 --> 02:10:14.439
BE WORKING ON RIGHT NOW TO TRY

02:10:14.506 --> 02:10:20.546
TO GET. THINGS BACK ON TRACK-

02:10:20.612 --> 02:10:23.382
THAT'S POST CODE NINETEEN. SO

02:10:23.448 --> 02:10:25.117
WHERE WAS THE ADDRESS THAT YOU

02:10:25.184 --> 02:10:27.119
WILL LOVE. COMPLAINTS I CAN

02:10:27.186 --> 02:10:29.054
ADDRESS THAT SOMETHING AND TAKE

02:10:29.121 --> 02:10:30.455
YOUR QUESTION I THINK THERE'S

02:10:30.522 --> 02:10:31.890
TWO THINGS NUMBER ONE I'D BE

02:10:31.957 --> 02:10:33.759
REMISS NOT TO SAY THAT WE NEED

02:10:33.825 --> 02:10:36.228
TO ADDRESSES. OF PORT RELIEVES

02:10:36.295 --> 02:10:37.162
YOU KNOW WE ARE DOING THAT AT A

02:10:37.229 --> 02:10:38.564
VERY ACTIVE LEVEL AT THE

02:10:38.630 --> 02:10:39.932
FEDERAL LEVEL. COURSE AT THE

02:10:39.998 --> 02:10:41.867
STATE LEVEL. OBVIOUSLY YOU SEEN

02:10:41.934 --> 02:10:43.001
THIS INDUSTRY RESEARCH

02:10:43.068 --> 02:10:44.836
OPERATION HAS WORKED DAY IN AND

02:10:44.903 --> 02:10:45.771
DAY OUT OUR MEN AND WOMEN ON

02:10:45.837 --> 02:10:47.439
THE WATERFRONT. JUST BEGINNING

02:10:47.506 --> 02:10:48.840
OF THIS CRISIS SO THE FIRST

02:10:48.907 --> 02:10:51.810
PART OF THAT- MY ANSWER IS UP

02:10:51.877 --> 02:10:53.245
FOR RELIEF WITH REGARD TO WHAT

02:10:53.312 --> 02:10:54.646
WE'VE DONE IN THE EXPENDITURES

02:10:54.713 --> 02:10:56.148
THAT WE MADE HERE. THE PORT

02:10:56.215 --> 02:10:59.284
DISTRICT. NUMBER TWO IS REGARD

02:10:59.351 --> 02:11:00.219
TO WHAT WE DO TOGETHER TO

02:11:00.285 --> 02:11:01.820
CONTINUE TO MAKE THIS WORK OF

02:11:01.887 --> 02:11:03.121
FICTION. AND I THINK THE

02:11:03.188 --> 02:11:04.756
INVESTMENT IN INFRASTRUCTURE

02:11:04.823 --> 02:11:06.992
PARTICULARLY RAIL. RAIL IS THE

02:11:07.059 --> 02:11:08.293
FUTURE IN TERMS OF HELPING MOVE

02:11:08.360 --> 02:11:09.695
CONTAINERS MORE EFFICIENTLY

02:11:09.761 --> 02:11:11.830
AND- WITH IT. A FRIENDLIER

02:11:11.897 --> 02:11:13.131
ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT SO I

02:11:13.198 --> 02:11:14.666
THINK BECAUSE- OF THE WORK

02:11:14.733 --> 02:11:16.268
NEEDED TO RECESSED PORTS AND

02:11:16.335 --> 02:11:18.103
INFRASTRUCTURE TO CREATE

02:11:18.170 --> 02:11:19.938
EFFICIENCIES AND CONGESTION. I

02:11:20.005 --> 02:11:27.779
THINK THE BETTER. AND I THINK

02:11:27.846 --> 02:11:28.247
THE LOSSES WHAT I SAID

02:11:28.313 --> 02:11:29.047
PREVIOUSLY. THANK YOU US THIS

02:11:29.114 --> 02:11:31.750
POLICY AND LIKE COLLEAGUE- DAY.

02:11:31.817 --> 02:11:34.419
DANIELLE THE BOOK. JUST BASIC

02:11:34.486 --> 02:11:36.221
MISTER WE NEED UP AND THAT PLAN

02:11:36.288 --> 02:11:39.891
SOME CAN MY MIND HAS INCLUDE A-

02:11:39.958 --> 02:11:40.826
ANY FURTHERING A TWO OF COURSE

02:11:40.892 --> 02:11:42.127
VISION CARE WE NEED TO WORK

02:11:42.194 --> 02:11:43.228
SUPPORT UP NIGHT AND DAY AND

02:11:43.295 --> 02:11:44.396
LIKE I SAID BEFORE. LABOUR'S

02:11:44.463 --> 02:11:47.532
RIGHT TO DO THAT. THANK YOU

02:11:47.599 --> 02:11:48.567
CENTER GUNS ALL DID YOU WISH TO

02:11:48.634 --> 02:11:49.801
SHARE ANY ON SOCIAL COUNTY

02:11:49.868 --> 02:11:58.477
FIRST I APOLOGIZE. I DON'T HEAR

02:11:58.543 --> 02:11:59.678
HER RIGHT NOW SO WE'LL GO TO

02:11:59.745 --> 02:12:02.547
THE LINE- JUST JUST QUICKLY

02:12:02.614 --> 02:12:05.284
JUST TO MAYBE I SHOULD HAVE A-

02:12:05.350 --> 02:12:06.318
MR VANDENBERG PLEASE EXPLAIN

02:12:06.385 --> 02:12:07.686
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ZERO AND

02:12:07.753 --> 02:12:10.455
NEAR ZERO. AND WHY NIGHT NEAR

02:12:10.522 --> 02:12:11.123
ZERO MIGHT BE SOMETHING THAT WE

02:12:11.189 --> 02:12:14.593
WANT TO. TO PAY MORE FOCUS ON

02:12:14.660 --> 02:12:16.395
IN THE IN THE SHORT TERM.

02:12:16.461 --> 02:12:17.496
MISTER VANDENBERG ARE YOU STILL

02:12:17.562 --> 02:12:19.998
ON YEAH. YES I AM. THANK YOU

02:12:20.065 --> 02:12:21.300
FOR THE QUESTION SO I DO THINK

02:12:21.366 --> 02:12:22.467
THE THIRD SO WHAT WE NEED TO

02:12:22.534 --> 02:12:24.336
LOOK AS A MULTI TIERED STRATEGY

02:12:24.403 --> 02:12:26.505
TO MOVE FORWARD. AND TO YOU I

02:12:26.571 --> 02:12:27.572
HATE TO USE A SPORTS ANALOGY

02:12:27.639 --> 02:12:29.641
BUT- YOU DO WANT TO LOOK AT

02:12:29.708 --> 02:12:30.776
JUST WHERE THE BALL IS TODAY

02:12:30.842 --> 02:12:32.010
BUT WHERE DO YOU NEED TO HAVE

02:12:32.077 --> 02:12:33.545
THE BALL DOWN THE ROAD. BUT I

02:12:33.612 --> 02:12:34.846
THINK TODAY WE CAN DEFINITELY

02:12:34.913 --> 02:12:37.082
GET WHAT PEOPLE CALL NEAR ZERO

02:12:37.149 --> 02:12:39.351
OR CULTURAL LOAD BOX TRUCKS-

02:12:39.418 --> 02:12:41.386
FURTHER OUT INTO USE. THAT

02:12:41.453 --> 02:12:42.921
WOULD BE PARTICULARLY THAT

02:12:42.988 --> 02:12:44.222
RIGHT NOW IT'S NATURAL GAS WITH

02:12:44.289 --> 02:12:45.824
LOW KNOCKS ENGINES. THEY'RE

02:12:45.891 --> 02:12:48.093
MUCH LOWER THE 90% CLEANER THAN

02:12:48.160 --> 02:12:49.828
DIESEL. AND THEY CAN USE

02:12:49.895 --> 02:12:50.996
RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS SO THEY

02:12:51.063 --> 02:12:52.531
CAN GIVE US. THE BENEFITS OF

02:12:52.597 --> 02:12:55.967
CLEANER AIR AS WELL AS CLIMATE

02:12:56.034 --> 02:12:56.968
ACTION. AT THE SAME TIME I

02:12:57.035 --> 02:12:58.003
THINK WE NEED O HAVE AT THE

02:12:58.070 --> 02:12:59.338
SAME TIME A PARALLEL STRATEGY

02:12:59.404 --> 02:13:01.707
TO KEEP MOVING FORWARD. ZERO

02:13:01.773 --> 02:13:03.275
WHICH MEANS NOTHING OUT OF THE

02:13:03.342 --> 02:13:05.544
TAIL PIPE. SO ZERO EMISSIONS

02:13:05.610 --> 02:13:06.545
FOUR CRITERIA MITTENS WITHIN

02:13:06.611 --> 02:13:08.847
THE REGION. AS WELL AS MOVING

02:13:08.914 --> 02:13:10.515
TOWARDS BECAUSE OF WHERE THE-

02:13:10.582 --> 02:13:12.484
UTILITY GRID IS GOING. ZERO

02:13:12.551 --> 02:13:14.419
EMISSIONS FOR CLIMATE AS WELL

02:13:14.486 --> 02:13:15.921
WE SHOULD BE. IN THE SOUTHERN

02:13:15.987 --> 02:13:17.489
CALIFORNIA REGION APPROACHING

02:13:17.556 --> 02:13:20.258
EIGHTY PERCENT. A REDUCTION AND

02:13:20.325 --> 02:13:22.361
CLIMATE IN POWER PRODUCTION. SO

02:13:22.427 --> 02:13:24.096
THAT MEANS ANYTHING USING THAT

02:13:24.162 --> 02:13:25.731
POWER IS GOING TO BE EIGHTY

02:13:25.797 --> 02:13:27.666
PERCENT. LOWER ALREADY. AND

02:13:27.733 --> 02:13:29.868
THEN SIR MISSION DR TRAITS OR

02:13:29.935 --> 02:13:31.136
ELECTRIC DRIVE TRAINS ARE MORE

02:13:31.203 --> 02:13:32.571
EFFICIENT THAN CONVENTIONAL

02:13:32.637 --> 02:13:33.772
DRIVETRAINS SO THEY WILL GET

02:13:33.839 --> 02:13:35.674
YOU EVEN FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD.

02:13:35.741 --> 02:13:37.042
SO I THINK IT GIVES US AN

02:13:37.109 --> 02:13:38.343
OPPORTUNITY TO DO. SOMETHING

02:13:38.410 --> 02:13:39.644
THAT'S A LOW EMISSION

02:13:39.711 --> 02:13:41.847
COMBUSTION ENGINE. SUCH AS LOW

02:13:41.913 --> 02:13:43.715
KNOCKS NATURAL GAS NOW. GET

02:13:43.782 --> 02:13:45.217
THOSE OUT IN THIS INTERIM

02:13:45.283 --> 02:13:46.952
PERIOD BUT START THIS FILL IN

02:13:47.018 --> 02:13:49.287
THE GAPS. AS ELECTRIC MOVES

02:13:49.354 --> 02:13:51.022
ONLINE AND FRANKLY ELECTRIC IS

02:13:51.089 --> 02:13:52.824
GOING TO BE SCALING OVER THE

02:13:52.891 --> 02:13:55.394
NEXT. EIGHT TO NINE YEARS. SO

02:13:55.460 --> 02:13:56.595
IT'S A DUAL PHASE TRACK IF YOU

02:13:56.661 --> 02:13:58.397
WILL. I THANK YOU. AND I THINK

02:13:58.463 --> 02:13:59.965
WHAT YOU POINT OUT VERY SIMPLY

02:14:00.031 --> 02:14:00.999
JUST HAVING ELECTRIC TRUCK IS

02:14:01.066 --> 02:14:02.467
ENOUGH. THERE ARE MANY THAT ARE

02:14:02.534 --> 02:14:03.668
COMMERCIALLY VIABLE IN THE

02:14:03.735 --> 02:14:05.570
HEAVY AND RIGHT NOW IF ANY. OF

02:14:05.637 --> 02:14:06.705
BUT YOU STILL NEED TO HAVE THE

02:14:06.772 --> 02:14:08.473
UTILITIES TO FEED THOSE TRUCKS.

02:14:08.540 --> 02:14:10.108
AND THOSE ARE SIGNIFICANT DRAWS

02:14:10.175 --> 02:14:12.644
ON POWER- AND SO THERE IS NOT

02:14:12.711 --> 02:14:13.378
JUST THE TRUCK BUT THE

02:14:13.445 --> 02:14:14.613
INFRASTRUCTURE TO CHARGE THAT

02:14:14.679 --> 02:14:16.381
TRUCK. IF YOU'RE GOING. TO

02:14:16.448 --> 02:14:18.083
DEMAND THAT IT. ONLY BE

02:14:18.150 --> 02:14:20.352
ELECTRIC OR HYDROGEN AND SOME

02:14:20.419 --> 02:14:20.952
OTHER SOURCES OUT THERE MIGHT

02:14:21.019 --> 02:14:23.255
WORK. AS WELL HUNDRED TRUCK

02:14:23.321 --> 02:14:24.623
ACTUALLY IS ELECTRIC TRUCK

02:14:24.689 --> 02:14:27.058
RIGHT AND- IT'S A GENERATOR.

02:14:27.125 --> 02:14:29.528
BEING POWER BY ABSOLUTELY. IT'S

02:14:29.594 --> 02:14:30.996
THE SAME THING EXCEPT WHERE TO

02:14:31.062 --> 02:14:32.464
THE ELECTRONS COME FROM AND IN

02:14:32.531 --> 02:14:34.699
THE CASE OF A- FUEL CELL TRUCK-

02:14:34.766 --> 02:14:35.700
THE ELECTRONS ARE COMING FROM

02:14:35.767 --> 02:14:37.936
STORED HYDROGEN. THE THING GETS

02:14:38.003 --> 02:14:39.371
TURNED INTO ELECTRICITY BUT THE

02:14:39.438 --> 02:14:45.510
POWER TRAIN IS THE. EXACT SAME

02:14:45.577 --> 02:14:46.111
AS A BATTERY ELECTRIC TRUCK.

02:14:46.178 --> 02:14:46.678
GREAT THANK YOU I WITH THAT

02:14:46.745 --> 02:14:48.213

BECAUSE I HAVE TO CATCH A

02:14:52.350 --> 02:14:54.619
PLANE. SO WE'RE GONNA GO TO THE

02:14:54.686 --> 02:14:57.122
PHONES AND IF. ANYONE GETS OFF

02:14:57.189 --> 02:14:59.524
