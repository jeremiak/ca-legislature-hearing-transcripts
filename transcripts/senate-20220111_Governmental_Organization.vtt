00:51:04.461 --> 00:51:06.096
COMMITMENT AND I KNOW THAT HE

00:51:06.163 --> 00:51:08.064
WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS.

00:51:08.131 --> 00:51:08.932

THANK YOU MR CHAIR- I. TWO. I

00:51:15.005 --> 00:51:17.274
WANT TO ECHO THE- SENTIMENTS OF

00:51:17.340 --> 00:51:23.313
MINE COLLEAGUE FROM ORLAND PARK

00:51:23.380 --> 00:51:26.049
- I AM SUPPORTIVE OF THE INTENT

00:51:26.116 --> 00:51:29.953
BEHIND THIS BILL I'VE HAD- GOOD

00:51:30.020 --> 00:51:31.021
DISCUSSIONS WITH THE AUTHOR OF

00:51:31.087 --> 00:51:33.323
THIS BILL. AND I ALSO HAVE TO

00:51:33.390 --> 00:51:35.325
SAY I HAVE FAITH IN THE AUTHOR.

00:51:35.392 --> 00:51:38.528
THAT HE WILL DO ALL THAT HE CAN-

00:51:38.595 --> 00:51:40.931
TO WORK THIS OUT. HE HAS PROVEN

00:51:40.997 --> 00:51:44.100
TO BE THAT KIND OF CHAMPION- FOR

00:51:44.167 --> 00:51:45.735
OTHER ISSUES AND SO I CERTAINLY

00:51:45.802 --> 00:51:48.004
DON'T THINK THAT HE WILL NOT-

00:51:48.071 --> 00:51:50.173
GIVE THE SAME KIND OF ATTENTION

00:51:50.240 --> 00:51:51.975
TO THIS ISSUE. I'VE HEARD THAT

00:51:52.042 --> 00:51:53.610
THERE WERE CONSTRUCTIVE

00:51:53.677 --> 00:51:55.712
DISCUSSIONS EVEN THIS MORNING

00:51:55.779 --> 00:51:57.514
WITH THE OPPOSITION AND I DO

00:51:57.581 --> 00:52:00.417
BELIEVE THAT- THINGS WILL GET

00:52:00.484 --> 00:52:03.286
WORKED OUT. YOU KNOW I YOU WOULD

00:52:03.353 --> 00:52:04.688
THINK I WOULD HAVE KNOWN MORE

00:52:04.754 --> 00:52:06.156
ABOUT THIS ISSUE BECAUSE I

00:52:06.223 --> 00:52:10.260
CERTAINLY INVITES. ARE BUT- I

00:52:10.327 --> 00:52:11.828
DON'T KNOW THAT MUCH ABOUT THIS

00:52:11.895 --> 00:52:14.030
ISSUE I DID READ THE LANGUAGE

00:52:14.097 --> 00:52:16.233
AND I READ THE ANALYSIS AND I

00:52:16.299 --> 00:52:18.268
READ MANY OF THE SUPPORT LETTERS

00:52:18.335 --> 00:52:20.270
AND LISTENED OBVIOUSLY TO THE

00:52:20.337 --> 00:52:22.138
FOLKS WHO CALLED IN ON BOTH

00:52:22.205 --> 00:52:24.007
SIDES. AND A FEW THOUGHTS WERE

00:52:24.074 --> 00:52:26.476
RAISED- THAT THE LANGUAGE

00:52:26.543 --> 00:52:27.878
ACTUALLY DOESN'T DISCRIMINATE

00:52:27.944 --> 00:52:29.713
BETWEEN LARGE AND SMALL

00:52:29.779 --> 00:52:31.715
DISTILLERIES WHICH IN MY MIND

00:52:31.781 --> 00:52:33.850
MEANS THAT SMALL DISTILLERIES-

00:52:33.917 --> 00:52:36.319
WILL LOSE OUT I MEAN JUST

00:52:36.386 --> 00:52:38.288
BECAUSE OF. YOU KNOW WHO HAS A

00:52:38.355 --> 00:52:40.357
GREATER SHARE OF THE MARKET WHO

00:52:40.423 --> 00:52:42.025
HAS MORE CAPACITY MORE CAPITAL

00:52:42.092 --> 00:52:44.327
GREATER INFRASTRUCTURE I THINK

00:52:44.394 --> 00:52:47.030
WE OWE IT TO OURSELVES TO TRY TO

00:52:47.097 --> 00:52:48.365
LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD AS MUCH

00:52:48.431 --> 00:52:50.433
AS POSSIBLE TO OUR SMALL AND

00:52:50.500 --> 00:52:51.434
FAMILY RUN IN CALIFORNIA

00:52:51.501 --> 00:52:53.370
DISTILLERIES. EVEN THOUGH I KNOW

00:52:53.436 --> 00:52:54.271
THERE ARE SOME ISSUES BETWEEN IN

00:52:54.337 --> 00:52:57.040
STATE OUT OF STATE AND HOW YOU

00:52:57.107 --> 00:52:58.775
CAN'T DISCRIMINATE- AT THE END

00:52:58.842 --> 00:53:01.244
OF THE DAY IT SEEMS TO ME FROM

00:53:01.311 --> 00:53:02.779
WHAT I'VE READ THAT DISTRIBUTORS

00:53:02.846 --> 00:53:03.980
ACTUALLY. DON'T SEEM TO WANT TO

00:53:04.047 --> 00:53:05.515
WORK WITH SMALL DISTILLERIES

00:53:05.582 --> 00:53:06.616
BECAUSE IT PROBABLY DOESN'T

00:53:06.683 --> 00:53:09.519
PENCIL OUT. IN YOU KNOW MY

00:53:09.586 --> 00:53:12.222
RESPONSE IS SHAME ON THEM- I

00:53:12.289 --> 00:53:15.492
THINK WE OWE IT TO. OUR CRAFT

00:53:15.559 --> 00:53:17.494
DISTILLERIES ESPECIALLY THOSE-

00:53:17.561 --> 00:53:19.462
HERE IN CALIFORNIA TO FIGURE OUT

00:53:19.529 --> 00:53:20.830
A WAY TO INCENTIVIZE OR

00:53:20.897 --> 00:53:22.732
ENCOURAGE DISTRIBUTORS TO WORK

00:53:22.799 --> 00:53:24.301
WITH THEM SO THAT WE CAN LEVEL

00:53:24.367 --> 00:53:25.368
THE PLAYING FIELD SO THAT

00:53:25.435 --> 00:53:27.571
CONSUMERS HAVE. ALL OPTIONS AT

00:53:27.637 --> 00:53:29.406
THEIR DISPOSAL TO BE SUPPORTIVE%

00:53:29.472 --> 00:53:30.707
OF SOME OF THE GREAT PRODUCTS

00:53:30.774 --> 00:53:32.375
THAT ARE COMING OUT OF THE STATE

00:53:32.442 --> 00:53:34.945
IN THAT ARE COMING FROM OUR

00:53:35.011 --> 00:53:36.947
SMALL CRAFT DISTILLERIES. N. YOU

00:53:37.013 --> 00:53:38.982
KNOW WE HEARD FROM FOLKS ON WHO

00:53:39.049 --> 00:53:40.917
SUPPORT THE BILL THAT THIS WILL

00:53:40.984 --> 00:53:42.986
CREATE JOBS BUT WE ALSO HEARD

00:53:43.053 --> 00:53:44.354
FROM FOLKS IN OPPOSITION. THAT

00:53:44.421 --> 00:53:46.456
DOGS WILL BE LOST AND I DO THINK

00:53:46.523 --> 00:53:48.191
WE OWE IT TO BOTH SIDES TO KIND

00:53:48.258 --> 00:53:49.993
OF FIGURE OUT WHAT THE

00:53:50.060 --> 00:53:51.761
COMPROMISES. BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE

00:53:51.828 --> 00:53:53.663
DON'T WANT MORE JOBS TO

00:53:53.730 --> 00:53:56.633
DISAPPEAR AND WE DON'T WANT.

00:53:56.700 --> 00:53:58.435
JOBS THAT ARE GOOD THAT DON'T

00:53:58.501 --> 00:53:59.936
HAVE BENEFITS THAT DON'T ALLOW

00:54:00.003 --> 00:54:01.271
FOLKS TO RAISE THEIR FAMILIES

00:54:01.338 --> 00:54:02.806
AND CARE FOR THEIR FAMILIES. WE

00:54:02.872 --> 00:54:04.441
DON'T WANT THOSE KINDS OF JOBS

00:54:04.507 --> 00:54:06.743
TO BE LOST. SO I AM RESPECTFULLY

00:54:06.810 --> 00:54:08.979
GONNA. LAY OFF AT THIS TIME

00:54:09.045 --> 00:54:10.313
BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THIS WILL

00:54:10.380 --> 00:54:12.716
GET OUT AND I WANT THE

00:54:12.782 --> 00:54:15.418
DISCUSSIONS TO CONTINUE. AND I

00:54:15.485 --> 00:54:18.121
INTEND TO BE ABLE TO VOTE ON A

00:54:18.188 --> 00:54:20.256
BILL WHEN IT COMES UP FOR ME

00:54:20.323 --> 00:54:21.925
AGAIN BECAUSE I AS I MENTIONED

00:54:21.992 --> 00:54:22.726
AT THE BEGINNING HAVE FAITH. IN

00:54:22.792 --> 00:54:25.228
THIS AUTHOR- THAT HE I GOING TO

00:54:25.295 --> 00:54:26.529
DO WHAT I THINK HE'S ALREADY

00:54:26.596 --> 00:54:28.431
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO DO

00:54:28.498 --> 00:54:31.034
BUT IT WAS PROBABLY JUST TIMING.

00:54:31.101 --> 00:54:32.802
FOR WHEN THIS BILL WAS BEING

00:54:32.869 --> 00:54:34.771
HEARD. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER

00:54:34.838 --> 00:54:38.808

WITH THE AUTHOR AND I GOTTA TELL

00:54:46.983 --> 00:54:49.853
YA I HOLD THE AUTHOR IN THE

00:54:49.919 --> 00:54:51.121
HIGHEST ESTEEM ARE BECAUSE HE'S

00:54:51.187 --> 00:54:53.390
A VERY THOUGHTFUL HAS A HISTORY

00:54:53.456 --> 00:54:56.026
OF WORKING WITH FOLKS AND-

00:54:56.092 --> 00:54:57.093
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT PASS

00:54:57.160 --> 00:54:59.095
FORWARD I THINK WE'RE LOOKING AT

00:54:59.162 --> 00:55:01.197
A BILL THAT HAS SOME UNEXPECTED

00:55:01.264 --> 00:55:03.633
COMPLEXITY AND CERTAINLY-

00:55:03.700 --> 00:55:06.936
DIVISION OF SPECIAL. INTERESTS

00:55:07.003 --> 00:55:09.539
BEING FROM FRESNO- NO DOUBT WE

00:55:09.606 --> 00:55:12.575
HAVE A STRONG DISTRIBUTION

00:55:12.642 --> 00:55:13.443
NETWORK SYSTEM IN THE CENTRAL

00:55:13.510 --> 00:55:16.246
VALLEY- ONE THAT I THINK HAS

00:55:16.312 --> 00:55:18.114
BEEN ESSENTIAL TO OUR ECONOMIC

00:55:18.181 --> 00:55:20.650
PROSPERITY- BUT REVIEWING THIS

00:55:20.717 --> 00:55:22.786
MATTER I THINK WE CAN ALL

00:55:22.852 --> 00:55:23.453
APPRECIATE THAT THE THREE TIERED

00:55:23.520 --> 00:55:26.790
SYSTEM. IS A LITTLE ARCHAIC AND

00:55:26.856 --> 00:55:29.993
IT NEEDS TO BE REVIEWED AND

00:55:30.060 --> 00:55:32.762
LOOKED AFTER- INTO WHAT IT'S

00:55:32.829 --> 00:55:34.764
LIKE FOR INDUSTRY MOVING FORWARD

00:55:34.831 --> 00:55:36.966
ESPECIALLY WITH LESSONS LEARNED

00:55:37.033 --> 00:55:40.236
FROM COVERT- BECAUSE WE'RE STILL

00:55:40.303 --> 00:55:41.771
REALIZING. HELLO INDUSTRY HAS

00:55:41.838 --> 00:55:43.440
BEEN IMPACTED BY THAT AND HOW WE

00:55:43.506 --> 00:55:46.076
HAVE BEEN NIMBLE. IN ALLOWING

00:55:46.142 --> 00:55:48.178
OUR ALCOHOL SALES DIRECTLY TO

00:55:48.244 --> 00:55:50.547
CONSUMERS- IN WAYS THAT ARE BOTH

00:55:50.613 --> 00:55:53.917
YOU KNOW CONVENIENT AND- IN

00:55:53.983 --> 00:55:56.419
RESOLVABLE FROM A- FROM A LEGAL

00:55:56.486 --> 00:55:58.755
STANDPOINT. OF THIS SITUATION

00:55:58.822 --> 00:56:02.358
IS- A LITTLE UNUSUAL I HAVE A

00:56:02.425 --> 00:56:04.728
HISTORY OF SUPPORTING OUR CRAFT

00:56:04.794 --> 00:56:08.965
BREWERS- WINERIES- DISTILLERIES

00:56:09.032 --> 00:56:10.967
BY IN MY DISTRICT I THINK IT YOU

00:56:11.034 --> 00:56:12.802
KNOW FOOD PRODUCTS. ARE ONE OF

00:56:12.869 --> 00:56:15.472
THE THINGS THAT WE CAN- FURTHER

00:56:15.538 --> 00:56:17.107
DEVELOP BECAUSE CALIFORNIA IS A

00:56:17.173 --> 00:56:18.742
SPECIAL BRAND WE HAVE SPECIAL

00:56:18.808 --> 00:56:21.811
QUALITIES AND- WE CAN SELL NOT

00:56:21.878 --> 00:56:24.147
JUST. WITHIN THE US- BUT

00:56:24.214 --> 00:56:27.083
CERTAINLY- ABROAD- WITH THE WITH

00:56:27.150 --> 00:56:29.252
THE WITH WITH GREAT SUCCESS. BUT

00:56:29.319 --> 00:56:31.221
I TOOK A LOOK AT THIS GRAND HOME

00:56:31.287 --> 00:56:34.157
DECISION AND THE COMMERCE CLAUSE

00:56:34.224 --> 00:56:36.359
MY FIRST INSTINCT WAS. WE WANT

00:56:36.426 --> 00:56:39.295
TO PROTECT THIS- SMALL BATCH.

00:56:39.362 --> 00:56:42.999
DISTILLERIES AND BREWERIES- THAT

00:56:43.066 --> 00:56:45.335
WE'D FIND A WAY TO LOOK AFTER

00:56:45.401 --> 00:56:46.936
THE BUDDING INDUSTRIES IN

00:56:47.003 --> 00:56:49.405
CALIFORNIA- THE SUPREME COURT

00:56:49.472 --> 00:56:51.307
DECISION IN GRAHAM HOME-

00:56:51.374 --> 00:56:54.043
INDICATES THAT- THERE MUST BE

00:56:54.110 --> 00:56:56.412
PARITY BETWEEN IN AND OUT OF

00:56:56.479 --> 00:56:58.314
STATE SALES OF FOR PURPOSES OF

00:56:58.381 --> 00:57:01.217
THE COMMERCE CLAUSE. AND I WENT

00:57:01.284 --> 00:57:03.987
BACK TO MY OLD LAW SCHOOL DAYS

00:57:04.053 --> 00:57:06.256
AND BEGAN TO FULLY APPRECIATE

00:57:06.322 --> 00:57:07.123
AND THEN CAME ACROSS THE

00:57:07.190 --> 00:57:10.727
KENTUCKY RULE- THAT. GOT AROUND

00:57:10.794 --> 00:57:12.428
THE GRAND HOME DECISION IN THE

00:57:12.495 --> 00:57:15.498
COMMERCE CLAUSE BUT LIMITING- TO

00:57:15.565 --> 00:57:19.102
TEN LEADERS- FOR EACH CONSUMER.

00:57:19.169 --> 00:57:21.371
AND SO I THINK THERE ARE WAYS TO

00:57:21.437 --> 00:57:23.339
LOOK AFTER IT AND DEVELOP OUR

00:57:23.406 --> 00:57:25.975
DISTILLERIES. BUT WE ALSO HAVE

00:57:26.042 --> 00:57:27.143
TO LOOK AFTER WAYS THAT WERE

00:57:27.210 --> 00:57:29.279
IMPACTING THE MARKET.

00:57:29.345 --> 00:57:31.314
DISTRIBUTION NETWORKS ARE NOT

00:57:31.381 --> 00:57:34.184
CHEAP. IT TAKES DRIVERS IT TAKES

00:57:34.250 --> 00:57:37.053
TRUCKS IT TAKES CENTER. IT TAKES

00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:39.155
THE G. SIX ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF

00:57:39.222 --> 00:57:42.125
INVESTMENT AND IF YOU'RE GOING

00:57:42.192 --> 00:57:44.460
TO INJECT UNCERTAINTY INTO THE

00:57:44.527 --> 00:57:46.162
MARKET ESPECIALLY IN A POST CODE

00:57:46.229 --> 00:57:48.832
SITUATION YOU HAVE TO APPRECIATE

00:57:48.898 --> 00:57:49.432
THE COMPLICATIONS AND

00:57:49.499 --> 00:57:54.437
IMPLICATIONS. OF YOUR

00:57:54.504 --> 00:57:56.639
INVOLVEMENT. I THINK THIS IS A

00:57:56.706 --> 00:57:57.240
THAT WAR. MORE DISCUSSION. I

00:57:57.307 --> 00:57:58.541
THINK THERE'S A PATH FORWARD

00:57:58.608 --> 00:58:00.276
HERE YOU KNOW WHETHER IT IS

00:58:00.343 --> 00:58:02.612
DROPPING IT DOWN AND I'D LIKE TO

00:58:02.679 --> 00:58:03.446
HEAR FROM THE AUTHOR IN ANY OF

00:58:03.513 --> 00:58:05.381
MY OTHER COLLEAGUES. THERE SEEMS

00:58:05.448 --> 00:58:07.817
TO BE WAYS THAT WE CAN- THAT WE

00:58:07.884 --> 00:58:10.653
CAN. ACHIEVE WHAT NEEDS TO BE

00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:11.988
DONE WHILE STILL LOOKING AFTER

00:58:12.055 --> 00:58:13.957
THE GOOD PAYING JOBS OF FOLKS

00:58:14.023 --> 00:58:15.291
THAT WORK IN THE DISTRIBUTION

00:58:15.358 --> 00:58:17.293
SYSTEM THE FOLKS THAT'LL THAT

00:58:17.360 --> 00:58:18.728
OWN AND OPERATE. THE

00:58:18.795 --> 00:58:21.130
DISTRIBUTION NETWORKS- THIS IS

00:58:21.197 --> 00:58:24.133
NOT A ZERO SUM GAME WITH WINNERS

00:58:24.200 --> 00:58:25.501
AND LOSERS I THINK THIS COULD BE

00:58:25.568 --> 00:58:27.937
A WIN WIN SITUATION. BUT THE WAY

00:58:28.004 --> 00:58:29.839
THAT IT'S DRAFTED RIGHT NOW. I'M

00:58:29.906 --> 00:58:31.441
AFRAID THERE ARE THERE ARE SO

00:58:31.507 --> 00:58:33.710
MANY LEGAL QUESTIONS THAT I'M

00:58:33.776 --> 00:58:35.879
JUST NOW FOR MORE FULLY

00:58:35.945 --> 00:58:38.081
APPRECIATIVE OF ON FOR EXAMPLE

00:58:38.147 --> 00:58:39.682
THE CALIFORNIA DEFINITION OF

00:58:39.749 --> 00:58:42.151
CRAFT. AND A HUNDRED AND FIFTY

00:58:42.218 --> 00:58:43.453
THOUSAND GALLONS YOU KNOW IS

00:58:43.519 --> 00:58:45.855
THAT LIMITED TO THE PRODUCTION

00:58:45.922 --> 00:58:46.956
OF THE FACILITY OR IS THAT

00:58:47.023 --> 00:58:48.925
LIMITED TO THE SPECIFIC LINE

00:58:48.992 --> 00:58:51.628
ITEM- AND ALL USE THE EXAMPLE

00:58:51.694 --> 00:58:53.830
OF. YOU KNOW IF A PARENT

00:58:53.897 --> 00:58:57.166
COMPANY- HAS MULTIPLE SMALL

00:58:57.233 --> 00:59:00.403
BATCH- SUBSIDIARIES YOU KNOW IS

00:59:00.470 --> 00:59:02.805
IT LIMITED TO THE VODKA. AS

00:59:02.872 --> 00:59:04.674
OPPOSED TO THE RASPBERRY VODKA.

00:59:04.741 --> 00:59:06.342
SO THERE'S A NUMBER OF LEGAL

00:59:06.409 --> 00:59:07.977
ISSUES HERE THAT I WOULD LIKE

00:59:08.044 --> 00:59:09.312
TIME TO TIBET TO BETTER

00:59:09.379 --> 00:59:10.847
APPRECIATE MAYBE THE AUTHOR AND

00:59:10.914 --> 00:59:12.849
POTENTIALLY THE CO AUTHOR CHAIR

00:59:12.916 --> 00:59:17.787
OF THIS COMMITTEE- CAN CAN- LINE

00:59:17.854 --> 00:59:19.422
THIS UP BETTER BUT- I THINK IF

00:59:19.489 --> 00:59:20.857
WE WERE TO. CONSIDER DROPPING

00:59:20.924 --> 00:59:24.460
DOWN THE- THE VOLUME TO A TO A

00:59:24.527 --> 00:59:26.663
RATE THAT DOES NOT AFFECT THE

00:59:26.729 --> 00:59:28.698
SUPERMARKETS AND THE RETAILERS

00:59:28.765 --> 00:59:30.266
THAT ARE SELLING YOU KNOW

00:59:30.333 --> 00:59:32.268
NORMALLY THE LARGE BRAND ITEMS

00:59:32.335 --> 00:59:34.137
BUT YOU CREATE A SITUATION WHERE

00:59:34.203 --> 00:59:37.907
SALES NUMBERS CAN MAKE A SMALL

00:59:37.974 --> 00:59:40.810
BATCH BREWERIES AND DISTILLERIES

00:59:40.877 --> 00:59:43.680
ATTRACTIVE TO GET ON THE SHELF.

00:59:43.746 --> 00:59:45.715
THAT COULD HELP OUR INTREPID

00:59:45.782 --> 00:59:48.251
NOURIEL DOT SET OF INDUSTRIES-

00:59:48.318 --> 00:59:50.086
SO I DON'T KNOW IF THE AUTHOR

00:59:50.153 --> 00:59:51.654
HAS ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR EVEN

00:59:51.721 --> 00:59:53.723
MY COLLEAGUES BUT THIS IS A WORK

00:59:53.790 --> 00:59:56.392
IN PROGRESS. IN NORMALLY I DON'T

00:59:56.459 --> 00:59:58.027
LIKE VOTING ON ON THINGS THAT

00:59:58.094 --> 01:00:00.797
HAVE SO MUCH TO DO BUT I WOULD

01:00:00.863 --> 01:00:03.299
LIKE TO HEAR. FROM OTHER FOLKS

01:00:03.366 --> 01:00:05.335
AND SEE IF THERE IS A WAY. FOR

01:00:05.401 --> 01:00:07.103
THIS TO BE A WIN WIN SITUATION

01:00:07.170 --> 01:00:08.538
BECAUSE I THINK IT'S JUST ABOUT

01:00:08.604 --> 01:00:10.406
THINKING IT THROUGH AND HAVING

01:00:10.473 --> 01:00:15.244
MORE DISCUSSION. SEVERAL FIRST

01:00:15.311 --> 01:00:17.613
OF ALL I WANT TO FAKE THANK YOU

01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:18.614
CENTER FOR JUST FOR THOSE

01:00:18.681 --> 01:00:20.316
COMMENTS AND OBVIOUSLY THANKS TO

01:00:20.383 --> 01:00:21.617
MY- MY OTHER COLLEAGUES HAVE

01:00:21.684 --> 01:00:24.520
SPOKEN SO FAR- THERE THERE'S NO

01:00:24.587 --> 01:00:26.789
QUESTION THAT WE'RE IN THE WE'RE

01:00:26.856 --> 01:00:28.324
NOT INTERESTED IN HARMING SMALL

01:00:28.391 --> 01:00:29.592
BUSINESS WE'RE NOT INTERESTED IN

01:00:29.659 --> 01:00:32.328
HARMING OUR JOBS- IN MANY

01:00:32.395 --> 01:00:34.263
RESPECTS I THINK THE IDEA BEHIND

01:00:34.330 --> 01:00:36.399
THIS BILL IF YOU LOOK AT THE

01:00:36.466 --> 01:00:37.367
WINE INDUSTRY WE'VE DISCUSSED

01:00:37.433 --> 01:00:41.204
THIS. THE WHEN SO MY FRIEND FROM

01:00:41.270 --> 01:00:42.238
LOS ANGELES AND A CALLER SAID

01:00:42.305 --> 01:00:45.108
SHAME ON ON THE ON THE ON THE

01:00:45.174 --> 01:00:47.543
DISTRIBUTORS FOR NOT. DOING MORE

01:00:47.610 --> 01:00:49.679
TO HELP OUT THE SMALL PRODUCERS-

01:00:49.746 --> 01:00:50.947
I THINK SHE ANSWERED HER OWN

01:00:51.014 --> 01:00:52.181
CONCERN WHICH HE SAID THAT THE

01:00:52.248 --> 01:00:54.050
END OF THE DAY THOSE SMALL

01:00:54.117 --> 01:00:55.284
PRODUCTS THEY JUST DON'T PENCIL

01:00:55.351 --> 01:00:56.486
OUT THE DISTRIBUTORS ARE REALLY

01:00:56.552 --> 01:00:58.187
FOCUSED ON ON THE BIG VERY

01:00:58.254 --> 01:01:00.523
POPULAR PRODUCTS THAT ARE TRIED

01:01:00.590 --> 01:01:02.125
AND TRUE AND AS THEY SHOULD BE

01:01:02.191 --> 01:01:03.292
RIGHT I MEAN THAT'S THAT'S THEIR

01:01:03.359 --> 01:01:04.394
BUSINESS MODEL IS MAKING MONEY

01:01:04.460 --> 01:01:06.496
SELLING AND DISTRIBUTING.

01:01:06.562 --> 01:01:08.297
DISTRIBUTING ARE THOSE TRIED AND

01:01:08.364 --> 01:01:10.099
TRUE PRODUCTS AND WHAT ENDS UP

01:01:10.166 --> 01:01:11.234
HAPPENING IS IT'S HARD FOR SMALL

01:01:11.300 --> 01:01:13.269
NICHE PRODUCTS TO BREAK IN TO

01:01:13.336 --> 01:01:14.704
THE MARKET WHAT'S HAPPENED WITH

01:01:14.771 --> 01:01:16.706
ONE OF COURSE IS THAT FOLKS GO

01:01:16.773 --> 01:01:18.207
TO HONOR THE FALLEN LOVE WITH

01:01:18.274 --> 01:01:19.542
THE WITH THE WITH THE PARTICULAR

01:01:19.609 --> 01:01:21.644
TYPE OF WINE AND THEY START TO

01:01:21.711 --> 01:01:23.246
BUY THE WINE THE WORD GETS OUT

01:01:23.312 --> 01:01:24.213
ABOUT THE WINE AND NEXT THING

01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:26.282
YOU KNOW THE ONE CONNECTS HER TO

01:01:26.349 --> 01:01:27.683
GROW IN POPULARITY AND AT SOME

01:01:27.750 --> 01:01:29.352
POINT THE DISTRICT WILL PICK IT

01:01:29.419 --> 01:01:30.653
UP BECAUSE THEY RECOGNIZE THAT-

01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:32.755
IT'S A IT'S A IT'S A POPULAR

01:01:32.822 --> 01:01:34.357
COLOR NOT LUCKY TAKE A CHANCE ON

01:01:34.424 --> 01:01:36.359
THE WIND. OUT THE GATE- THERE'S

01:01:36.426 --> 01:01:38.194
SO MANY GREAT CRAFT WINE

01:01:38.261 --> 01:01:40.496
PRODUCERS IN DISTILLERS AND BEER

01:01:40.563 --> 01:01:42.565
PRODUCERS ALL ALL THROUGHOUT THE

01:01:42.632 --> 01:01:45.435
STATE AND- AND YOU KNOW HOW WHAT

01:01:45.501 --> 01:01:47.870
WHY WHY WOULD THEY POSSIBLY TAKE

01:01:47.937 --> 01:01:49.238
A CHANCE ON A SMALL ONE IN

01:01:49.305 --> 01:01:51.140
LESSER SOME KIND OF INCENTIVE

01:01:51.207 --> 01:01:52.875
WAS TRADED TO PRODUCTS THAT'S

01:01:52.942 --> 01:01:54.277
WHAT THIS IS OPENLY ABOUT BEING

01:01:54.343 --> 01:01:56.646
UP IN SPACE FOR THOSE PRODUCTS

01:01:56.712 --> 01:01:59.482
TO GET OUT. TO CONSUMERS SO THAT

01:01:59.549 --> 01:02:01.084
WHEN SOMEONE GOES TO A DEALER

01:02:01.150 --> 01:02:04.320
THEY GO TO- A BREWERY AND THEY

01:02:04.387 --> 01:02:05.455
FALL IN LOVE WITH A PARTICULAR

01:02:05.521 --> 01:02:07.290
PRODUCT AND THEN I PROBABLY NEED

01:02:07.356 --> 01:02:09.625
TO BE THE CARD STORE THEY CAN

01:02:09.692 --> 01:02:11.694
FIND A WAY TO GET THE PRODUCT IN

01:02:11.761 --> 01:02:18.801
THE FUTURE DIRECTLY SHIPPED. TO

01:02:18.868 --> 01:02:21.370
THAT. NOW I. CLEARLY I A YOU

01:02:21.437 --> 01:02:22.605
KNOW THE- GUYS WE'RE TALKING

01:02:22.672 --> 01:02:24.140
ABOUT WHAT WILL I'M TALKING.

01:02:24.207 --> 01:02:25.208
SMALL THIS. AND SMALL PRODUCER.

01:02:25.274 --> 01:02:26.309
AND THE WAY BILLS RIGHT RIGHT.

01:02:26.375 --> 01:02:28.778
IT APPLIES TO EVERYBODY. AND I

01:02:28.845 --> 01:02:29.345
UNDERSTAND THERE'S A LOT OF

01:02:29.412 --> 01:02:31.147
FOLKS OUT THERE WHO WHO WANT TO

01:02:31.214 --> 01:02:33.883
LIMIT- SO I DO THINK THERE'S NO

01:02:33.950 --> 01:02:34.550
QUESTION MY MIND THE BILL WE'RE

01:02:34.617 --> 01:02:36.018
GONNA TO GO FURTHER AND LIMITING

01:02:36.085 --> 01:02:37.086
THE NUMBER OF BOTTLES- PER

01:02:37.153 --> 01:02:39.255
PERSON PER MONTH THAT WE HAVE A

01:02:39.322 --> 01:02:41.224
CRAFT RIGHT NOW IT'S SET AT THE

01:02:41.290 --> 01:02:41.958
KENTUCKY STANDARD. I'M HEARING

01:02:42.024 --> 01:02:43.359
FROM FOLKS THAT WE NEED TO KNOCK

01:02:43.426 --> 01:02:44.327
THAT NUMBER DOWN I'M ACTUALLY

01:02:44.393 --> 01:02:46.295
HAPPY TO DO THAT- YOU KNOW SO

01:02:46.362 --> 01:02:48.731
THAT'S ONE THING. THE OTHER

01:02:48.798 --> 01:02:49.265
THING IS. THE DISTINCTION

01:02:49.332 --> 01:02:50.233
BETWEEN BIG PRODUCERS AND SMALL

01:02:50.299 --> 01:02:51.367
PRODUCERS AND SMALL PRODUCT. AND

01:02:51.434 --> 01:02:53.402
HERE THE OTHER DAY MY FOCUS IS

01:02:53.469 --> 01:02:55.705
REALLY ON ON TRYING TO PROVIDE.

01:02:55.771 --> 01:02:59.208
MORE OPPORTUNITIES MORE ACCESS.

01:02:59.275 --> 01:03:00.243
FOR FOR THE SMALL BUSINESSES

01:03:00.309 --> 01:03:01.878
THAT ARE PRODUCING THESE. THESE

01:03:01.944 --> 01:03:04.080
FANTASTIC ARTISANAL PRODUCTS-

01:03:04.147 --> 01:03:05.581
YOU KNOW THERE IS A CONSUMER

01:03:05.648 --> 01:03:07.283
EQUITY QUESTION ASSOCIATED WITH.

01:03:07.350 --> 01:03:10.653
THE CURRENT SYSTEM AND- AND THE

01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:11.721
ISSUES THAT WE'RE TRYING TO

01:03:11.787 --> 01:03:13.489
RESOLVE WITH THIS BILL. BUT

01:03:13.556 --> 01:03:15.525
SUFFICE TO SAY I YOU KNOW I

01:03:15.591 --> 01:03:16.926
CAN'T SEE THIS BILL. COULD GET

01:03:16.993 --> 01:03:19.362
HOW THIS LEGISLATURE WITHOUT-

01:03:19.428 --> 01:03:22.198
WITH WITHOUT OUR REALLY REALLY.

01:03:22.265 --> 01:03:25.968
CONFINING V. VIS. A DIRECT

01:03:26.035 --> 01:03:30.907
CONSUMER. OFFER TO TWO SMALL

01:03:30.973 --> 01:03:33.476
SMALL BATCH PRODUCTION. I THINK

01:03:33.543 --> 01:03:35.044
I THINK. THAT WILL ULTIMATELY

01:03:35.111 --> 01:03:36.879
RESOLVE THE CORE OPPOSITION

01:03:36.946 --> 01:03:38.614
CONCERNS WE'VE HEARD FROM THE

01:03:38.681 --> 01:03:39.615
TEAMSTERS AND THE GROCERS IN THE

01:03:39.682 --> 01:03:41.150
DISTILLERS WHO IN IT. THAT'S

01:03:41.217 --> 01:03:42.985
RIGHT THE DISTRIBUTORS. WHO OF

01:03:43.052 --> 01:03:44.420
COURSE IN THE END THEY ARE

01:03:44.487 --> 01:03:49.425
REALLY FOCUSED ON THE BIG. THE

01:03:49.492 --> 01:03:51.460
BIG PRODUCTS. I SAY. I YOU KNOW

01:03:51.527 --> 01:03:54.063
MOST ARE ABLE TO GOING TO- YOU

01:03:54.130 --> 01:03:56.098
KNOW. WHAT WHAT WHY WOULD THEY

01:03:56.165 --> 01:03:58.067
WANT TO TELL THE EXTRA SHIPPING

01:03:58.134 --> 01:03:59.202
WHEN THEY CAN GO DOWN TO THE

01:03:59.268 --> 01:04:01.237
CORNER STORE AND BUY THE PRODUCT

01:04:01.304 --> 01:04:02.471
THE MAKER'S MARK DOWN THE CORNER

01:04:02.538 --> 01:04:04.373
STORE- WHEN THEY CAN YOU KNOW

01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:07.243
THE SO I DO THINK THAT THIS THIS

01:04:07.310 --> 01:04:08.544
CONCERN HAS BEEN RAISED ABOUT

01:04:08.611 --> 01:04:10.046
HOW THIS IS GOING TO COLLAPSE

01:04:10.112 --> 01:04:11.514
THE SYSTEM IS JUST TOTALLY

01:04:11.581 --> 01:04:13.115
OVERBLOWN IT'S HYPERBOLIC I JUST

01:04:13.182 --> 01:04:15.351
DON'T BELIEVE IT'S TRUE BUT I

01:04:15.418 --> 01:04:16.185
UNDERSTAND THAT PEOPLE ARE. YOU

01:04:16.252 --> 01:04:17.253
KNOW ALWAYS GOING TO BE CONCERNS

01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:20.990
ABOUT ANY KINDS OF CHANGES IN IN

01:04:21.057 --> 01:04:24.193
IN IN THE REGULATORY SYSTEM SO.

01:04:24.260 --> 01:04:26.562

01:04:26.629 --> 01:04:30.166
GIVE US THE CHANCE. TO FIGURE

OUT A PASSWORD WITH THIS BILL.

01:04:32.268 --> 01:04:34.303
THAT WILL. THAT WILL FOCUS ON

01:04:34.370 --> 01:04:35.738
OUR ULTIMATE INTENT WHICH IS TO
