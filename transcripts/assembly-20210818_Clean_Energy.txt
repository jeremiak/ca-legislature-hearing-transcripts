WELCOME YOU ALL TO THIS INFORMATIONAL HEARING OF THE ASSEMBLY SELECT COMMITTEE ON CALIFORNIA'S CLEAN ENERGY ECONOMY. I'M BILL CHURCH COURT CHAIR OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE. I'M GOING TO GO THROUGH THIS PAD- JUST HERE THERE IS A MASK REQUIRE FOR IN TO IN THE ROOM PLUS- PLEASE MAINTAIN PROPER MASK USAGE AT ALL TIMES DO NOT REMOVE OR LOWER YOUR MASK WHEN SPEAKING. WE APPRECIATE YOUR COOPERATION AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE. WE HAVE A FEW DIFFERENT OPTIONS FOR PUBLIC TESTIMONY TODAY. EACH MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY FOR UP TO TWO MINUTES AT THE END OF THE HEARING. IN ADDITION TO BE ABLE TO TESTIFY FROM INSIDE THE HEARING ROOM WILL HAVE THE OPTION OF TESTIFYING IN REMOTE. TESTIMONY STATION ON THE NORTH STEPS OF THE CAPITOL. FOR THE PUBLIC IN THE ROOM AT THE END OF THE HEARING IF ANY MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC IN THE ROOM WOULD LIKE TO PROVIDE PUBLIC COMMENT. PLEASE RAISE YOUR HAND AND I WILL ASK YOU TO APPROACH THE MICROPHONE AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. I WOULD ASK THAT THE PUBLIC NOT TOUCH THE MICROPHONE- YOU CAN EXIT THE HEARING ROOM WHAT YOU'RE DONE. RETURN TO YOUR SEAT PLEASE BE SURE TO OBSERVE PHYSICAL DISTANCING. UPON LEAVING THE CAPITAL INCLUDING LIMITING ELEVATOR USE. TO A SMALL NUMBER OF PEOPLE AT THE TIME. WE WILL ALSO BE USING A MODERATED TELEPHONE SERVICE FOR PUBLIC COMMENT. THE CALL IN NUMBER FOR THIS HEARING IS EIGHT SEVEN SEVEN. SIX NINE TWO EIGHT NINE FIVE SEVEN SO GET ON THE CALL IN NUMBER IS EIGHT SEVEN SEVEN. SIX NINE TWO EIGHT NINE FIVE SEVEN IN THE ACCESS CODE IS. ONE THREE ONE. FIVE FOUR TWO. ZERO TWO. SO AGAIN THE NUMBER IS EIGHT SEVEN SEVEN. SIX NINE TWO. EIGHT NINE FIVE SEVEN. AND THE ACCESS CODE IS ONE THREE ONE. FIVE FOUR TWO ZERO TWO. YOU CAN FIND THIS NUMBER ON THE ASSEMBLY WEBSITE AS WELL AS ON YOUR TV SCREEN. IF YOU'RE CALLING IN PLEASE ELIMINATE ANY BACKGROUND NOISE. THIS INCLUDES MOOD MUTING YOUR LIVESTREAM BROADCASTING YOUR SMART DEVICES. TO REDUCE THE SOUND DISTORTION. IF YOU'RE HAVING ANY PROBLEMS WITH THE MODERATED PHONE SERVICE YOU WOULD LIKE TO SUBMIT WRITTEN TESTIMONY. YOU CAN CALL- THE OFFICE- MY OFFICE AT NINE ONE SIX. THREE ONE NINE TWENTY TWENTY THAT'S BE THERE TO TRY AND HELP. THANK YOU FOR BEARING WITNESS AS WE IMPLEMENT METHODS TO CONTINUE TO SERVE THE PEOPLE CALIFORNIA AND KEEP THEM SAFE- TODAY WE'RE GOING TO DISCUSS THE CHALLENGES OF SCALING UP SEASONAL ENERGY STORAGE TECHNOLOGY. IN ORDER TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE ZERO CARBON. AND WE'RE PARTICULARLY CONCERNED HERE ABOUT. NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND HOW WE WOULD BRING THE MEN TO- A COMMERCIALIZATION. ADDRESS B. ONE HUNDRED WE IN THE LEGISLATOR LEGISLATURE. SAID AMBITIOUS GOAL OF MAKING ELECTRICAL GRID ZERO CARBON BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE. THERE CERTAINLY EFFORTS TO EVEN DO IT FASTER THAN THAT. HOWEVER AS WE USE MORE RENEWABLE ENERGY. AND THEY COME ON LINE. RENEVIA SOLUTIONS PROVIDE CALIFORNIA WITH OF COURSE A RELIABLE ENERGY SUPPLY. DESPITE SEASONAL VARIATIONS IN SOLAR AND WIND POWER PRODUCTION AND OTHER METHODS IT WILL PROBABLY BE DEVELOPING OVER TIME. RIGHT NOW RENEWABLE ENERGY IN CALIFORNIA IS LIKELY TO BE OVER GENERATED IN THE SPRING AND SUMMER MONTHS THAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW. AND IT IS NOT LIKELY TO MEET OUR DEMANDS IN THE WINTER- FOR THAT REASON WE'RE GONNA NEEDS. STORAGE NOT ON THE ORDER OF. IT TOOK ABOUT LONG TERM STORAGE IS SOMETHING MORE THAN FOUR HOURS. WE'RE GOING TO NEED SOMETHING THAT'S MORE THAN FOUR DAYS PROBABLY ON THE ORDER FOR MONTHS OR EVEN LONGER. AND pABOUT THIS. SEASONAL ENERGY STORAGE TECHNOLOGIES CAN FILL THE GAP BY PROVIDING ENERGY ENERGY STORAGE. SO THAT WELL WE HAVE A SURPLUS IT'S SOMETIMES OF YOURS AND THE WINTER WHEN WE'RE LIKELY TO HAVE A DEFICIT WE CAN AGAIN HAVE A RELIABLE SUPPLY. HOWEVER MANY SEASONAL STORAGE TECHNOLOGIES ARE CURRENTLY IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT STAGE ARE NOT COMMERCIALLY DEVELOPED COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE. AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE'RE GOING TO BE DISCUSSING TODAY. THESE TECHNOLOGIES- MAKE IT. A NEED TO MAKE IT THROUGH THE CHALLENGING PHASE OF COMMERCIALIZATION. KNOWN AS THE VALLEY OF DEATH. SO YOU CAN HAVE A SOFTWARE COMPANY A START UP LIKE FACEBOOK. AND IT STARTS BY SERVING THE PEOPLE AT HARVARD AND THEN THE IVY LEAGUE AND THEN COLLEGES AND THEN. THE REST OF THE US AND THEN THE WORLD YOU COULD SCALE IT UP. SCALING UP ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES VERY DIFFERENT YOU CAN HAVE A LAB PROCESS YOU'RE GONNA NEED A PILOT PLANT THE PILOT PLANT THAT IS GOING TO REQUIRE REALLY pREALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT YOUR ECONOMY IS GOING TO BE INTO YOUR BILL THESE ON THIS POTENTIALLY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. SO ENSURING THAT SEASONAL STORAGE TECHNOLOGIES ARE AT SCALE AND COST EFFECTIVE IN TIME. TO MEET THE NEEDS OF A ZERO CARBON BRIDGES BOTH THE TECHNICAL CHALLENGE IN THE POLICY PROP CHALLENGE WHAT WE CAN DO IS POLICY- TO ENCOURAGE THESE COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENTS WITHOUT. IN OUR FINGER ON THE SCALE AND SAYING THI IS THE ONE BECAUSE FRANKLY. YEAH IT SHOULDN'T BE CHOSEN BY. I LEGISLATORS IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO. LOOK AT EXPERTS MARKET CONDITIONS IT CETERA. SO THE PURPOSE OF THE HEARING TODAY IS TO UNDERSTAND THE ROLE OF SEASONAL STORAGE WILL BE FIRST ASKING HOW MUCH ARE WE LIKELY TO NEED. THE CHALLENGES COMMERCIALIZATION OF THESE TECHNOLOGIES AND THEN WHAT'S BEING DONE TO ENSURE. THE DEVELOPMENT AND DEPLOYMENT OF ENERGY STORAGE IN A TIME TO MEET OUR TWENTY FORTY FIVE OR PERHAPS EVEN EARLIER GOALS. AND TWENTY FORTY FIVE IN TERMS OF DEVELOPING THE TECHNOLOGY IS RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER. ANYTHING FASTER IS AN EMERGENCY WHICH WERE IN. SO I'D LIKE TO THANK THE WITNESSES WILL BE WITH US TODAY PLEASE NOTE THAT THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO SHARE THEIR VIEWS AT THE END OF HEARING. NOW I'D LIKE TO INVITE THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE TO SHARE THEIR THOUGHTS AND COMMENTS. ASSEMBLY MEMBER MAYES- WITH NOW. ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHANNEL. THANK YOU FOR- SO THE FIRST. PART THAT WILL GOING TO BE LOOKING AT HERE. THE FIRST PANEL I HAD TO START OFF TODAY- GABE MURTADA WITH THE CALIFORNIA INDEPENDENT SYSTEM OPERATOR. WILL TALK TO US ABOUT THE NEED TO THE GREAT IN THE ROLE OF SEASONAL ENERGY STORAGE AS MORE RENEWABLE. ENERGY SOURCES ARE BROUGHT ONLINE. SO I'D LIKE TO ENCOURAGE THE COMMITTEE TO HOLD OTHER QUESTIONS UNTIL THE END OF THE PANEL. WHEN WE CAN DIRECT- QUESTIONS TO BOTH SPEAKERS. ARM AND THE NEXT- SPEAKER AFTER- MISTER MURTADA- WILL BE DOCTORS SERRA COURAGE FROM UC MERCED AND WE'LL GET INTO THAT A LITTLE LATER SO- MR MURTAJA CAN YOU COME ONLINE AND SPEAK TO US. AFTERNOON CAN YOU HEAR ME YES. WHAT BOB WELL GOOD AFTERNOON ASSEMBLY BEN KIRK- DR KURT AND THE VERY DISTINGUISHED MEMBERS OF THE SECOND PANEL OF THIS DISCUSSION TODAY AND OTHERS WHO ARE LISTENING IN IT'S A GREAT PLEASURE TO BE HERE AND SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY. HI MY NAME IS DAVE BURKE LAW AND MY OFFICIAL TITLE HALF CALIFORNIA ISO IS STORAGE SECTOR MANAGER AND- IF THAT. I MEANS WHAT IT SAYS I MANAGE MOST THINGS THAT THE ISO RELATE TO STORAGE. LIKE NEW POLICIES- THAT ARE COMING ONLINE NEXT MODELS THE RESOURCES AT OUR MARKET AND EVENTUALLY GET THEM COMPENSATED FOR THE ENERGY THAT RESTORED RESOURCES THAT THEY MOVE AND POORLY FROM ONE PART OF THE DAY TO THE OTHER. AND FOR- OPTICAL RESEARCH DEPARTMENT FOR THE ENERGY TO GET- SO WITH THAT IN MIND I'M GOING TO BE SPEAKING ON A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER BURKE JUST MENTIONED AND SETTING THE BACKDROP BACKDROP FOR THE CONVERSATION THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DAY. SO FOR REFERENCE AND IT IS NUMBERS THAT WE CAN KEEP IN MIND THE CALIFORNIA SYSTEM IS A SUMMER PEAKING SYSTEM. AND IT TAKES THAT JUST UNDER FIFTY THOUSAND MEGAWATTS. DOWN DURING THE SUMMER DURING THE MOST CRITICAL HOURS OF NEED FOR THE SYSTEM. CONDITIONALLY MOST OF THE LOAD IN THE STATE HAS BEEN SERVED WITH NATURAL GAS FIRED GENERATION AND OVER THE YEARS WE'VE SEEN DEEPER AND DEEPER PENETRATION OF RENEWABLE RESOURCES. AND YOUR ACCOUNT YEAH THAT'S TRUE ACROSS THE COUNTRY YOUR CALIFORNIA'S RENEWABLE RESOURCES HAVE PRIMARILY BEEN SOLAR ALTHOUGH WE DO HAVE SOME WIND GENERATION AND FROM SMALL HYDRO FACILITIES ON OUR SYSTEM AS WELL THAT MAKE UP SOME OF THAT GENERATION- THE STORAGE RESOURCES IN PARTICULAR HAVE BEEN GROWING. CONSIDERABLY RETURNS- YEARS AND MONTHS- JUST FOR REFERENCE LAST YEAR WE HAD ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED MAKE A LOT OF WORDS ON OUR SYSTEM. TODAY WE HAVE ABOUT FIFTEEN HUNDRED MEGAWATTS OF STORAGE OR SYSTEM SO AGAIN FOR A TOTAL SYSTEM THAT SERVING A LITTLE BIT LESS THAN FIFTY THOUSAND MEGAWATTS- A JUMP OF ONE THOUSAND MEGAWATTS OF ANY TECHNOLOGY IS A PRETTY RADICAL CHANGE. AND A JUMP OF A THOUSAND MEGAWATTS OF NEW GENERATION OF SOMETHING THAT WE DON'T REALLY HAVE ONLINE. PRIOR TO THAT IS A VERY BIG CHANGE- THAT APPLY ADDITIONAL WORLD. THAT THE SYSTEM OPERATOR NEEDS DID YOU UNDERSTAND HOW THESE RESOURCES WORK- HOW TO USE THESE RESOURCES THE MOST EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY AND- HOW THEY'RE GOING TO INTEGRATE WITH THE REST OF THE SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE ONLINE I JUST WANT I HATE TO INTERRUPT GONE GONNA BREAK MY OWN RULE. UP THAT'S FIFTEEN HUNDRED MEGAWATTS OF POWER HOW MANY HOURS CAN. YOU RUN THAT FIFTEEN HUNDRED MEGAWATT. LITTLE BIT MORE THAN THREE HOURS SO NEARLY AND I WAS JUST ABOUT TO GET TO THAT- BUT NEARLY ALL OF THE RESOURCES THAT ARE IN OUR SYSTEM TODAY OUR LITHIUM ION BATTERIES. AND MOST OF THE RESOURCES ON OUR SYSTEM OUR FOUR HOUR DURATION SO WHAT THAT MEANS IS IF YOU HAVE A PLUS OR MINUS TEN MEGAWATT BATTERY SO IT CAN EITHER CHARGE FOR AS MUCH AS I CAN MAKE A LOT WORKING JUST CHARGE AS MUCH AS TEN O'CLOCK ANY INSTANTANEOUS POINT IN TIME. THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF STATE CHARGES THOSE RESOURCES CAN ACCOMMODATE IS BETWEEN ZERO MEGAWATT HOURS AND FORTY MEGAWATT HOURS SO THEY CAN. TAKE. OUR DURATION SOME OF THEM ARE ONLY ONE HOUR DURATION AND THAT'S WHAT BRING THE AVERAGE DOWN JUST A LITTLE BIT. VERY GOOD PLEASE PROCEED. ABSOLUTELY SO THE NOTED THE CHANGES AND THE CAPACITY VALUES- YEAR OVER YEAR ARE VERY VERY LARGE- THE LAST TIME THAT WE'VE SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS WITH ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO WHEN WE HAD SIMILAR YOU KNOW I WOULD I WOULD CALL EXPLOSIVE GROWTH OF SOLAR ACROSS THE STATE AND DURING THAT PERIOD WE HAD INCREASES OF ABOUT ONE TO TWO THOUSAND MEGAWATTS OF SOLAR PER YEAR AND FRANKLY WE'RE OF INCREASES OF THIS FOUR HOUR DURATION- BUT YOUR MIND STORAGE OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS- SO. I WANTED TO STAGE A LITTLE BIT AND PERHAPS THE QUESTION OF WHY ARE WE HERE TODAY WELL WE'RE HERE TODAY TO TALK ABOUT SEASONAL ENERGY STORAGE. AND THE FIRST THING THAT I WOULD KNOW IS THAT THE DATE. THE LITTLE STORAGE IS NOT SOMETHING THAT NECESSARILY DEFINED BY THE CALIFORNIA ISO IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT'S NECESSARILY DEFINED BY THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES CMMISSION- AND IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW WE HAVE ON OUR GREAT TODAY AND NOT SOMETHING THAT WERE OPERATING. SO I THINK- THE FRAMEWORK THAT ASSEMBLY MAKE WORK SET UP AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS CALL IS EXACTLY CORRECT. WE'RE VERY MUCH IN THE EXPERIMENTAL AND THEORETICAL PHASES OF. WHAT THIS TECHNOLOGY COULD POTENTIALLY DO IN THE FUTURE AND WE'RE NOT YET AT A POINT WHERE. WE'RE REALLY CONSIDERING- IT WERE LOOKING ACTUAL OPERATIONAL DATA FOR THESE RESOURCES- SO WE SHOULD KEEP THIS IN MIND- THAT RIGHT NOW IT'S PRIMARILY AN ACADEMIC EXERCISE. BUT AS WE'VE SEEN OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS EVEN WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF BUT YEAH MY ON BATTERIES AT SHORTER DURATION LEVINE BATTERIES- THAT WE CAN GO VERY QUICKLY FROM ACADEMIC EXERCISES. TO ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTING THESE RESOURCES ON THE GRANT. EXISTENTIALLY USING THEM TO RETIRE TRADITIONAL RESOURCES- THAT ARE EITHER OLD WORK POTENTIALLY- MORE POLLUTING THAN OTHERS. SO WHY IS ENERGY NECESSARY I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE CRITICAL QUESTIONS THAT WE NEED TO ASK OURSELVES. AND ENGINEERS WORKING THIS QUESTION IS YOU KNOW RIGHT AT THE DOORSTEP SB ONE HUNDRED WHERE WE HAVE REQUIREMENTS TO GET A 100% GREENHOUSE GAS. FREE ELECTRICITY GENERATION BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE THIS IS A PROBLEM THAT- THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION IN CALIFORNIA I ALSO ARE THINKING ABOUT VERY HARD- AND HAD AND TRYING TO. NAVIGATE OUR WAY. TOWARD HALF THAT WE CAN GET TO A SOLUTION- TO HAVE G. H. G. FREE ELECTRICITY GENERATION. SO IN THE NEAR TERM WHAT THAT MEANS IS RETIRED YET IT COULD DISCERN THIS ON THIS PROCESS IN THE NEAR TERM WHAT THAT MEANS IS RETIREMENT- VERY OLD AND EXPENSIVE AND NOT PARTICULARLY EFFICIENT AFTER GAS GENERATING RESOURCES AND REPLACING THOSE RESOURCES IN AN IDEAL WORLD- WITH SOME SORT OF A TECHNOLOGY THAT GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS FREE. OKAY CALIFORNIA TODAY I HAVE NEVER MENTION THIS AFFECTED WE MEAN- REPLACING IT WITH WIND OR SOLAR GENERATION OF SOME VARIETY. UNFORTUNATELY AND I'M REALLY HOPING THAT THIS ISN'T NEWS TO ANYBODY- WE ALREADY HAVE A LOT OF SOLAR RESOURCES ON OUR SYSTEM TODAY AND ADDITIONAL GENERATION FROM SOLAR- COULD POTENTIALLY. PUT THE SYSTEM IN A POSITION WHERE WE HAVE SATURATION DURING SOME HOURS OR EVEN SOME OF THE YEAR- TODAY YOU GOING INTO SPRING IS ALREADY NOTED IN THE INTRODUCTORY COMMENTS WE DO HAVE A FREQUENT NEED THAT BACKGROUND SOLAR GENERATION FOR PEAK OUTPUT AND THIS IS ALREADY HAPPENING- BECAUSE WE ARE GENERATING MORE SOLAR ENERGY THAN IS NEEDED. TO SERVE HELLO TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- THIS OCCURS FOR THREE. REASONS THERE'S OTHER. THAT THAT PLAY A ROLE AS WELL. BUT IN THE SPRING WE DO TYPICALLY. HI SOLAR HIGH ENOUGH STORAGE IN GENERAL- SO WE HAVE MORE SUPPLY. WE ALSO HAVE SPRINGTIME RUNOFF SO THE ICE AND SNOW IS MELTING OF THE MOUNTAINS THAT INCREASING THE GENERATION THAT WE GET FROM OUR RUN OF RIVER HYDRO RESOURCES WHICH IS ALSO INCREASING THE SUPPLY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IN THE FINAL IN THE SPRING WE ALSO TYPICALLY HAVE COOLER WEATHER WHICH TRANSLATES TO LOW OR MODERATE LOWS. ACROSS THE SYSTEM. AND THIS MEANS THAT- YEAH ONE FACT. THAT CALL. IT JUST OVER GENERATIONS OF ELECTRICITY- SO RIGHT NOW- DURING THOSE SUMMER TIME PERIODS WHEN WE HAVE OUR ABSOLUTE HIGHEST HE NEED FOR THE SEASON- WE HAVE JUST ENOUGH AGGREGATE GENERATION TO MEET THOSE NEEDS YEAH THERE ARE EVENING HOURS- NEED NEED TYPICALLY OCCUR AFTER THE SUN GOES DOWN. SO EFFECTIVELY IF WE BROUGHT ON HUNDRED TONS AND TONS OF NEW SOLAR IT WOULD REALLY HELP US MEET THE NEEDS- BECAUSE WE REALLY NEED THE ENERGY AFTER THE SOLAR IS ALREADY OFFLINE FOR THE DAY- SO WHAT CAN POTENTIALLY DO OBVIOUSLY THE ANSWER IS- YEAH IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE. SHORT DURATION BATTERY SO IF WE DO INTEGRATE MEANS- LITHIUM ION FOUR HOUR DURATION BATTERIES LIKE WE'RE DOING ON OUR SYSTEM TODAY WE CAN SOLVE THIS PROBLEM WE CAN BRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY WHEN WE GOT SOLAR ONLINE AND IN THE END OF THE DAY AFTER SORTS OFFLINE WILL BE HAVE A GREATER NEED FOR GENERATION. AND THEN MORE STILL AFFECTED WE GETTING HI THERE ARE- VERY LOW COSTS ARE VERY EFFICIENT GAS GENERATION OR POTENTIALLY ON THOSE DAYS AND WE HAVE SOLAR CURTAILMENT- WE'RE GETTING ACCESS SOLAR INTEGRATED WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE NOT BEEN ABLE TO GENERATE AND STORE- STORED IN ELECTRONIC BATTERIES AND THEN THEY CAN BE USED AND DISPATCH. UNDERGRAD AT A LATER POINT IN THE DAY. SO RIGHT NOW FOUR INVESTMENT IN ME- THE NEED IS AT THE OF THE DAY AND AT- JUST JUST FOR TARGETED. BUT AS WE GET DEEPER AND DEEPER STORAGE PENETRATION ON THE GRAND EVENTUALLY WE'RE GONNA NEED STORAGE THAT PROVIDE SERVICES FOR MORE THAN JUST A FEW HOURS OF THE DAY- AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE OFFERING TO OR IS TYPICALLY REFERRED TO AN INDUSTRY AS- LONGER RATIONS STORAGE SO WE'RE EVENTUALLY GOING TO NEED BATTERIES THAT ARE CAPABLE OF. PROVIDING EIGHT HOURS A STORAGE DURATION OR TEN HOURS OF STORAGE DURATION OR EVEN MORE- AGAIN AS WE GET MORE RETIREMENT OF TRADITIONAL RESOURCES AND START REPLACING THEM WITH RENEWABLE RESOURCES WIND OR SOLAR- AND TO BE HAPPY BATTERIES TO COLLECT EXCESS WIND OR SOLAR- FROM THAT GENERATION AND THEN. MOVED TO ACTIVELY MOVE THAT INTERVIEW FROM ONE TIME OF THE DAY TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DAY- IF WE YOU KNOW- I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT. AS WE GO FURTHER IN THE FUTURE- WE'RE IN WE'RE GOING TO START THE FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES ARE GRANTED THE BIGGEST AT NEED ARE GOING TO SHIFT FROM- THAT THOSE SUMMER VERY HIGH HEAT DAYS TO ACTUALLY- THE WINTER WHEN WE HAVE POTENTIALLY LOWER SOLAR GENERATION YET AGAIN AL GORE RICH. MAKEUP CHANGES WILL HAVE- PLENTY OF OTHER SOLAR GENERATION IN THE SUMMER WHEN THE SUN IS ABUNDANT BUT IN THE WINTER WHEN DAYS ARE MUCH SHORTER AND SO WE'RE GENERATIONS LAST WILL START TO FEEL THE PINCH- IN THE OVERNIGHT HOURS WHEN THERE'S NO SOLAR GENERATION- AND IT COULD POTENTIALLY BE EXACERBATED BY FEAR IS WHEN THERE'S VERY LITTLE WIND DURING THE DURING OUR CROSS ENTIRE DAY AND THAT'S REALLY THE TIME FRAME WHEN WE START TO SEE A SHIFT FROM THE NEED. FOR STORAGE RATIO AND THAT IS PERHAPS ONLY A FEW HOURS- TWO ONE THAT COULD POTENTIALLY STAND- FOR MOVING ENERGY DURING THESE RELATIVELY ABUNDANT TIMES PERHAPS IN THE SUMMER- FOR THE FALL. YEAH IN THE WINTER. WHEN THERE'S NOT A WHOLE LOT OF SO WE'RE GONNA WHICH STATE WILL BE RELY ON. AS WE SEE OUR RENEWAL GENERATION SOLAR GENERATION INCREASE OVER THE YEARS- SO IF WE WERE LIKE IN THE TO A MARATHON RACE. I WOULD SAY- AMERICAN RACING THE RACE WAS- WHERE WE ARE IT'S EARNS OUT THINKING ABOUT AND MOVING TOWARDS DIFFERENT STORAGE SOLUTIONS WELL BASICALLY JUST GETTING OFF THE STARTING BLOCK- WE'RE LEARNING HOW BATTERIES OPERATOR GRANT WE STARTED TO DESIGN MODEL THAT CAN ACCOMMODATE STORAGE RESOURCES ON OUR GREAT. AND AS THOSE MODELS. YEAH YOU KNOW WHAT FORMING OF MODEL AND THERE THEY WILL IMPROVE AND OF ALL TO ACCOMMODATE THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF FUNCTIONS THAT BATTERIES CAN PERFORM- BUT THAT DOES TAKE TIME AND- EFFORT. AND EVENTUALLY WILL START YOU NEED THESE OTHER KINDS OF STORAGE RESOURCES AS WELL MIDWAY THROUGH THE RACE WILL BE THINKING ABOUT- LONGER DURATION STORAGE IN THAT EVENTUALLY TOWARD THE END OF THE RACE. WELL WHO WILL START YOU NEED TO THINK ABOUT- SEASONAL STORAGE AND HOW THAT PLAYS INTO MARKETS BUT WE'RE VERY VERY LONG WAY OFF FROM DOING THAT AT THIS POINT- IT'S GOING TO TAKE A LOT OF EXTRA STUDY AND A LOT OF EXTRA RESEARCH. YOU KNOW HOW THESE ARE GOING TO HATE AND TO SET UP THE RIGHT INCENTIVES. TO GET THE PROPER RESOURCES ONLINE- AND THEN THE RIGHT MARKET TOOLS IN PLACE. THAT WE CAN USE THESE RESOURCES PROPERLY AND EFFECTIVELY TO GET ELECTRICITY. THIS CALIFORNIA. I'M SHE ARTS ABOUT MINUTES TEN- SO PROUD AWHILE FOR OF ALL I'M JUST COULD TO TRY AND ADD A COUPLE OF POINTS TO AUDIENCE MAY NOT FOR BEING FAMILIAR WITH THE TECHNOLOGY YOU CAN'T REALLY USE BATTERIES TO STORE POWER FOR MONTHS AND MONTHS AND MONTHS YOU GET SELF DISCHARGE WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH LITHIUM AND COBALT AND OTHER MATERIALS TO MAKE BATTERIES WHICH CAN STORE THING FOR MONTHS IT'S JUST NOT SOMETHING THAT IS. LIKELY TO HAPPEN. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT LITHIUM ION BATTERIES THERE ARE OTHER TECHNOLOGIES WHICH WILL GET INTO WHICH- BATTERY ORIENTED SUCH AS- FLOW BATTERIES AT CETERA BUT- THE CURRENT TECHNOLOGY IS NOT ONE THAT'S GOING TO STORE THING FOR MONTHS. THE OTHER THING IS IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A WINTER DAY WHERE THERE'S AND- YOU'VE DONE A GREAT JOB WITH THE ISO SHOWING THE WINTER DAYS WITH NO SIGN AND NO WIND. THAT THIS HAPPENS YOU'RE REALLY TALKING ABOUT MANY GIGAWATTS. OF WET SUMMER DEMAND IS ACHIEVING WINNER DEMAND IS PROBABLY THIRTY GIGAWATT THIRTY GIGAWATTS- THIRTY THOUSAND MEGAWATTS SOMETHING LIKE THAT. AND YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT PERHAPS- SOMETHING LIKE- GEOTHERMAL WHICH IS BASELOAD PERHAPS SOME OTHER BASELOAD TECHNOLOGIES WERE DEVELOPED BUT WE'RE TALKING ON THE ORDER OF TENS OF GIGAWATTS TENS OF THOUSANDS OF MEGAWATTS OF GENERATION NEEDED. AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IT FOR PERIODS OF DAYS. MAYBE WEEKS- IF YOU LOOK AT THE MOST EXTREME CASE AND WE KNOW WE CAN'T AFFORD TO BE WITHOUT ELECTRICITY FOR EVEN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME FOR HEALTH SAFETY AND ECONOMIC REASONS. SO WE REALLY ARE TALKING ABOUT HERE OF. GIGAWATTS OF CAPACITY THOUSANDS OF MEGAWATTS OF CAPACITY ON THE ORDER OF CHANCE TEN TO TWENTY SOMEWHERE IN THERE PROBABLY. AND WE ARE TALKING ABOUT STORAGE FOR AT LEAST WEEKS. AS OPPOSED TO HOURS MAYBE FOR MONTHS. IT'S JUST AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE DIFFERENT AND I JUST GO- I THINK THAT- AS AN EXPERT- YOU WERE IMPLYING THIS BUT I JUST WANTED TO GET THAT POINT ACROSS TO THE AUDIENCE- I'D NOW LIKE TO OPEN THIS FOR QUESTIONS- MISTER CHANNEL. ANYONE NOW- WELL. QUESTION BUT I THINK UP PLEASE DO THINK I'D LIKE TO HEAR THE OTHER SPEAKERS FIRST BEFORE I GET INTO THE QUESTION OKAY MAKE SURE GOING TO COVER- SO I THINK WE'VE GOTTEN. TO THAT POINT- I REALLY. YOU KNOW THERE'S A- THE NEXT SPEAKER COMES FROM THE BEST KEPT SECRET IT YOU SEE UC MERCED. AND IF I WERE GOING TO TALK TO A STUDENT. AND THEY SAID WE REALLY WANT TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO MAKE OUR GRID WORK. I'D SAY GO TO THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA MERCED. AND TALK WITH DR SARAH KURTZ. SHE HAS AN AMAZING RESUME I'M GONNA TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF TIME OFF FROM THE USUAL PROPOSAL JUST READ SOME OF THIS. PHD FROM HARVARD THIRTY YEARS SAID NATIONAL RENEWABLE ENERGY LABORATORY IN GOLDEN COLORADO. KNOWN FOR HER COLLABORATIONS AND CONTRIBUTIONS TO DEVELOPING MULTI JUNCTION SOLAR CELLS AND MORE RECENTLY WORK ON PHOTOVOLTAIC PERFORMANCE RELIABILITY. WORK HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED WITH THE JOINTLY RECEIVED DAN DAVID PRIZE IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN. THE CHERRY AWARD IN TWENTY TWELVE AND THE C. THREE E. LIFETIME ACHIEVEMENT AWARD IN TWENTY SIXTEEN. AND INDUCTION TO THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF ENGINEERS IN TWENTY TWENTY AND- NATIONAL ACADEMY IS IT OF ENGINEERING ONLY HAS THE BEST ENGINEERS IN THE WORLD. AS PART OF THAT ACADEMY. SHE'S NOW AT- UC MERCED WHERE SHE STUDIED THE VALUE OF LONG DURATION STORAGE UNDER CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION GRANT. AND I KNOW SHE'S VERY EXCITED TO- TO SPEAK TO US TODAY AND TO SUPPORT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO ADOPTION OF RENEWABLE ENERGY THROUGH RESEARCH AND EDUCATION. SAID DR CURTIS- WE-WERE VERY ANXIOUS TO HEAR FROM YOU AND THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY. THANK YOU IT'S MY PLEASURE TO BE TO BE ABLE TO COME AND JOIN YOU TODAY AND IT'S A SPECIAL TREAT BECAUSE THIS IS SUCH AN EXCITING TIME FOR- THE INDUSTRY WITH THE TRANSITION INTO A NEW ENERGY SYSTEM CAN YOU CONFIRM THAT YOU CAN BOTH HEAR ME AND SEE MY SLIDE OKAY. YES OKAY SO I'M HERE TO TALK TO YOU TODAY ABOUT SEASONAL ENERGY STORAGE WHICH IS A NECESSITY FOR AS LOW CARBON GRID. BUT I'D LIKE TO START BY POINTING OUT THAT ENERGY STORAGE IS A NECESSITY FOR ANY ANY ENERGY SYSTEM. AND EFFECTIVE DAY IF YOU LOOK THE EIA MAINTAINS A DASHBOARD TO TRACK THE NATURAL GAS STORAGE CONCEDED DIFFERENT REGIONS OF THE COUNTRY. HERE YOU CAN SEE OVER THE COURSE OF THE YEAR. THE STORAGE IN THE UNDERGROUND- IN NATURAL GAS STORAGE IT WILL DECREASE DURING THE WINTER AS IT'S USED FOR HEATING AND THEN OVER THE SUMMER. THE REFILL THAT CAVERN WITH MORE NATURAL GAS THEY ALSO TRACK- OIL AND OTHER THINGS AND HERE I HAVE. A COLLECTION OF ALL THE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT YOU CAN SEE. WITH THE- DIFFERENT TYPES OF STORAGE RESERVOIRS AND IF YOU LOOK AT THIS IN TERMS OF IF YOU TOOK THIS ENERGY IN THESE AND USED IT TO POWER THE ELECTRICITY GRID WE COULD POWER THE US POWER GRID FOR ALMOST A HALF A YEAR WITH THESE RESEARCH CENTER THERE. SO INTERESTING QUESTION IS WHO PAYS FOR THE STORAGE THE CUSTOMERS WHO GET THAT NATURAL GAS IF IT WAS STORED DURING THE SUMMER AND THEN THAT STILL PER TO THEM WITH WINTER HEAT THEY'LL PAY A LITTLE BIT EXTRA FOR THE WINTER. TIME NATURAL GAS BECAUSE THE PRICES ARE HIGHER IN THE WINTER- BUT IF YOU LOOK AT SAY THE STRATEGIC PETROLEUM RESERVE AND IF YOU'VE BEEN AROUND AS LONG AS I HAVE YOU REMEMBER THE OPEC OIL EMBARGO SOME YEARS AGO WHICH MOTIVATED US TO CREATE THIS. IT'S REALLY THERE FOR NATIONAL SECURITY WHEN PEOPLE DO THE MODELING TO SAY WHAT'S THE COST OF STORAGE WE NEED TO MEET TO BE ABLE TO PAY FOR THAT STORAGE. IF YOU LOOK AT THE LENGTH OF TIME THE ENERGY HAS BEEN IN THAT STRATEGIC PETROLEUM RESERVE AND WHETHER IT COULD MAKE A RETURN ON INVESTMENT- YOU'LL FIND THAT NOBODY CAN MAKE A BUSINESS MODEL OUT OF THIS IT'S NOT A BUSINESS MODEL FOR BEING ABLE TO DO ENERGY SALES IT'S THERE FOR NATIONAL SECURITY. SO I SUGGEST THAT WHEN WE'RE THINKING ABOUT ENERGY STORAGE WE NEED TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN PRACTICALITY AND SECURITY. AND I'M THEIR DIFFERENT TECHNICAL TERMS YOU MAY USE FOR THIS BUT JUST TO NOTE PRACTICALITY IS THAT WE NEED STORAGE FOR THE NIGHT TIME AND FOR CLOUDY DAYS WE ALSO NEED STORAGE THAT- I CALL SEASONAL HERE AND THE DIFFERENTIATING OF THESE- CAN GET A LITTLE COMPLICATED BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT THIS THAT'S HERE FOR SEASONAL. IS LARGELY FOR SECURITY. THE WE WANT TO HAVE AN INSURANCE POLICY AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE SCRIPT AGAIN YOU CAN SEE THE DURING THE WINTER IT COMES DOWN. BUT THIS GRAY AREA IS LOOKING AT A FIVE YEAR MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM AND WHAT YOU SEE IS THAT OVER THE COURSE OF FIVE YEARS WE NEVER GO DOWN TO ZERO. WE INTENTIONALLY SIZE THE STORAGE SO THAT WE NEVER GO DOWN TO ZERO BECAUSE E WANT THE INSURANCE. THAT IF SOMETHING REALLY STRANGE HAPPENS AND HAVING JUST BEEN THROUGH THE PANDEMIC WE CAN ALL SEE THAT STRANGE THINGS CAN HAPPEN. THINGS THAT WE NEVER EXPECTED CAN DISRUPT THE SUPPLY CHAINS. AND HERE WE BUILT THIS IN TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR SUPPLY CHAIN FOR ENERGY BECAUSE ENERGY IS SO FOUNDATIONAL FOR SOCIETY WE NEED TO HAVE THAT THERE AS SECURITY. SO WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SEASONAL- STORAGE I HOPE WE CAN BE THINKING ABOUT NOT JUST DELIVERING- THAT KILOWATT HOUR ONCE A YEAR AFTER THAT STORAGE IN NEEDING TO PAY FOR THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT PAYING FOR THE SECURITY. SO KEY QUESTION TO BE INTERESTING TO DISCUSS IS WILL DECARBONIZE ENERGY SYSTEM NEED MORE FOR LESS STORAGE HERE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE TWO DAY IN THE US WE HAVE MAYBE SIX MONTHS WORTH. IN THE FUTURE WE PROBABLY DON'T NEED THE STRATEGIC PETROLEUM RESERVE BECAUSE WE HAVE OUR OWN SUNSHINE SO WE DON'T NEED TO WORRY ABOUT AN OIL EMBARGO. BUT WE DO NEED TO WORRY ABOUT A BIG STORM AND WHAT WILL HAPPEN THERE- I'D LIKE TO TALK NEXT ABOUT FOUR OF THE REALLY EXCITING APPROACHES TO SOLVING- AT LEAST PARTS OF THESE PROBLEMS. AND THERE ARE SO MANY TECHNOLOGIES OUT THERE I COULD- TALK ABOUT TODAY I'VE CHOSEN THESE FOR- LARGELY BECAUSE I DO SEE THAT THEY HAVE. A REAL SCALABILITY- AND ALSO BECAUSE MAYBE I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT BATTERIES TODAY BECAUSE YOU'VE ALL HEARD ABOUT BATTERIES SO I'VE- CHOSEN THINGS THAT MAYBE GIVE YOU A LITTLE DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE THAN WHAT YOU TYPICALLY LOOK AT. SO THE FIRST STRATEGY I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS USING AS MAKING HYDROGEN. SO WE SOMETIMES THINK ABOUT BUILDING MORE SOLAR WE JUST HEARD ABOUT THAT IF WE BUILD MORE SIMILAR THAN WE'RE GOING TO HAVE OVER GENERATION AND THEN WHAT DO WE DO WITH THAT. FIRST I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT I DON'T THINK THAT. NECESSARILY TURNING THE SOLAR PLANT OFF IS A BIG DEAL. IT'S TRIVIAL TO TURN A SOLAR PLANT OFF IT'S HARDER TO TURN A NATURAL GAS PLANT OFF THERE'S- WEAR AND TEAR ASSOCIATED WITH THE NATURAL GAS PLANT TURNING IT ON AND OFF IN A COAL PLANT. OR NUCLEAR PLANT CAN TAKE LIKE A FULL DAY TO TURN THEM ON AND OFF. I'M IN A PEAKER PLANT MADE SIT IDLE MOST OF THE YEAR AND ONLY GET TURNED ON ONCE IN AWHILE. SO IF WE TURN OFF THE SEWER PLANT 10% OF THE YEAR IT DOESN'T REALLY MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE TO THE SOLAR PLANT ALTHOUGH IT DOES MEAN THERE'S pLESS RETURN. TO THE INVESTOR ON THAT. BUT LET'S SAY IF WE BUILD MORE SOLAR. AND WE BUILD MORE ELECTROLYTES HERS WHAT I'VE DRAWN OVER HERE. IS THE MONTHLY ELECTRICITY AS A FUNCTION OF THE TIME OF YEAR AND HERE'S THE MONTHLY GLOW THAT WAS OBSERVED IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. IF WE SCALED UP THE SOLAR GENERATION THAT WE SAW IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN BIG ENOUGH THAT DURING THE WINTER MONTHS YOU ACTUALLY GENERATE ENOUGH ELECTRICITY. TO BE ABLE TO SUPPLY THAT THE WINTERTIME MODE. WE HAVE NOW ALL THIS EXTRA AND YOU CAN VIEW THIS IS A PROBLEM BUT YOU COULD VIEW IT AS AN OPPORTUNITY WE NEED HYDROGEN WE'RE GOING TO NEED HYDROGEN TO DRIVE FUEL CELLS TO MAKE FERTILIZER. WE'RE GOING TO WANT TO MAKE THAT HYDROGEN AND SO IF WE LOOK AT NOW WE'VE MADE ALL THESE ELECTROLYTES HERS. WE CAN USE THEM DURING THE TIME WHEN YOU SEE THIS YELLOW WE CAN USE THAT TO MAKE THE HYDROGEN AND THEN. WHEN WE GET INTO THE WINTER WE CAN JUST TURN THIS OFF IN FACT THEY WANT TO TURN OFF. THE ELECTROLYZER IS TO MAKE HYDROGEN IT'S ECONOMICAL IF THE PRICE OF ELECTRICITY IS LOW BUT WHEN THE PRICE OF ELECTRICITY GOES UP. IT BECOMES UNECONOMICAL TO MAKE HYDROGEN SO THEY'RE GOING TO WANT TO TURN OFF DURING THOSE TIMES. SO THESE NEW ELECTRICAL LOADS LIKE- AND ELECTROLYZER ENABLES US TO USE MORE DEMAND MANAGEMENT AND I NOTE THAT AROUND THE WORLD THE AND- IN HIGH. IS SO THESE ARE EXPENSIVE TECHNOLOGIES NOW BUT AS THEY GO FORWARD IT WILL BE LESS. IN LOOKING NEXT AT- THE OTHER TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE ARE READY. TO BE SCALED UP. THE WE CAN USE COMPRESSED AIR. THERE ARE ALREADY TOO LARGE COMPRESSED AIR STORAGE SYSTEMS THAT HAVE BEEN OPERATING FOR DECADES. I AM VERY INTRIGUED BY HI RESTORE HAS MADE AN INNOVATIVE ADVANCED VERSION OF THE COMPRESSED AIR. WHAT THEY'VE DONE IS INSTEAD OF USING A SALT CAVERN THERE AREN'T THAT MANY PLACES IN THE WORLD WHERE THERE'S SALT CAVERN- LOW IN THE GROUND INSTEAD WHAT THEY'VE DONE IS TO. GO DOWN AND HOLLOW OUT IN AND THE NEED REALLY SOLID ROCK SO KEEP IN MIND. THAT WHEN YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT DRILLING DOWN AND MAYBE BRING IN OIL OUT FRACKING OR WHATEVER YOU NEED REALLY POROUS ROCK. SO YOU CAN GET THE OIL TO COME OUT BUT IN THIS CASE THEY NEED REALLY SOLID ROCK BUT THEY GO DOWN AND HOLLOW OUT THAT REALLY SOLID ROCK. AND THEN THEY ALSO PUMP- THE DRILL HOLE DOWN. AND PUT WATER DOWN WITH A BLADDER HERE WHICH ALLOWS THEM. TO OPERATE THIS AT A CONSTANT PRESSURE MODE WHICH ALLOWS THEM. TO DO A DEEP DISCHARGE WHERE IS THE HISTORICAL COMPRESSED AIR. IF YOU RUN IT DOWN SO ALMOST ALL THE ERRORS OUT OF IT IT DOESN'T HAVEAS MUCH PRESSURE BUT WITH THE BLADDER YOU CAN KEEP THE PRESSURE HIGH. BETA PROJECTS RUNNING AROUND THE WORLD TO DEMONSTRATE THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY. AND YOU CAN SEE IT'S VERY SCALABLE IT'S BUILT ON BEING ABLE TO DRILL WELLS THE OIL INDUSTRY IS LOOKING FOR WAYS. TO APPLY THEIR SKILLS TO CLEAN ENERGY. AND A USES MINING TECHNOLOGY SO IT'S USING THAT SKILL SETS AND EQUIPMENT THAT'S ALREADY READILY AVAILABLE AND VERY SCALABLE- SIMILARLY IF YOU TAKE COMPRESSED AIR INTAKE A LITTLE FURTHER- YOU COOL IT DOWN. IF YOU NO LONGER HAVE TO COMPRESS IT SO MUCH- IF YOU COULD ENOUGH TO BECOMES LIQUID AND MANY OF YOU ARE MOST OF YOU HAVE EXPERIENCE WITH LIQUID NITROGEN. SO MAKING THERE IS VERY SO- HI IF YOU POWER IT HAS BEEN WORKING ON THIS TECHNOLOGY FOR MORE THAN A DECADE. I'M THEY STORE THE ENERGY IN THE LIQUID AIR AND THEY HAVE PROJECTS GOING. IN SPAIN AND CHILE AT A UTILITY SCALE SIZE. THIS IS A GREAT SCALABLE IT'S USING. THE TANKS THAT STORE THE CRYOGENIC LIQUIDS ARE ESSENTIALLY THE SAME TANKS THAT YOU USE A FOR LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS AND IF YOU'VE BEEN FOLLOWING. THE NATURAL GAS INDUSTRY YOU KNOW THAT THE HUGE DEVELOPMENT IS THAT IN THE GOLF. THEY'VE PUT IMPORTS THAT CANS- LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS PUT IT ON SHIPS AND THEN SHIPPED AROUND THE WORLD AND EXPORT NATURAL GAS TO OTHER PLACES. SO THIS IS TECHNOLOGY THAT'S AVAILABLE ON A VERY LARGE SCALE. AND AGAIN THE COMPANIES WHO HAD BEEN INVESTING IN THE FOSSIL FUELS ARE LOOKING FOR WAYS TO USE THEIR SKILLS. TO HELP TECHNOLOGIES LIKE THIS. HI HE WAS VERY INTERESTED IN DOING- PROJECTS INC IN CALIFORNIA AS WELL AS SOME OF THESE OTHER PLACES AROUND THE WORLD. NOW THIS- LAST EXAMPLE THAT I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU IS ONE I WAS VERY SKEPTICAL WHEN I FIRST HEARD OF IT. BUT THE MORE I'VE LEARNED OF IT THE MORE IMPRESSED I AM. WITH THE ENERGY IS LOOKING AT STORING THE ENERGY AND- BY COMPRESSING THE ROCK. WHAT THEY DO IS TO DRILL A HOLE DOWN DEEP. AND THEN THEY HERE. NOW AGAIN THEY NEED VERY SOLID ROCK IF THIS IS POOREST ROCK LIKE THE KIND OF ROCK THAT YOU FIND IF THERE'S OIL AROUND. THEY'RE NOT GOING TO DRILL DOWN TO ADAPT THAT PUTS THEM INTO POROUS ROCK THEY'RE GOING TO DRILL TO A GAP THAT'S REALLY SOLID ROCK AND THEY NEED. TO SEE. THIS CAVERN. THE PUSH THE WATER. AND WHEN THE WATER COMES DOWN IT FORCES THE- THEY ON ROCK ON THE TOP TO LIFT UP. AND THE ROCK HUNDRED NEEDS TO PRESS DOWN. AND THE ENERGY THAT SPENDING THAT COMPRESSED ROCK YOU'D THINK OF ROCK AS A SPRING BUT EFFECTIVELY IT CAN WORK AS A SPRING. IN THE CONSTRUED STORE TREMENDOUS AMOUNTS OF ENERGY THERE. THE USE OF HYDRO POWER OF MOVING WATER TO BE ABLE TO TURN A TURBINE IS WELL ESTABLISHED FOR HYDRO POWER AROUND THE WORLD. THEY'VE GOT PROJECTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND IN CANADA AND AGAIN THIS IS VERY SCALABLE. THEY CAN BRING IN A DRILL THEY TELL ME THAT THEY CONTROL THIS WHOLE IN A DATE USING STANDARD OIL. DRILL SORTS OF TECHNOLOGY. AND THEN THE HYDRO POWER EQUIPMENT IS ALSO READILY AVAILABLE- IF THESE PROJECTS- ARE SUCCESSFUL IN DEMONSTRATING THEIR ABILITY TO CONTROL OF THIS AGAIN WE CAN USE THOSE- COMPANIES THAT ARE OUT THERE ALREADY WITH TECHNOLOGY AND KNOW HOW. TO DEPLOY THIS ON A HUGE SCALE. SO JUST IN SUMMARY- THE ANSWERS TO THE QUESTIONS WHAT ROLE THE STORAGE PLACE. STORAGE IS NEEDED TO GET THROUGH THE NIGHT- SEASONAL STORAGE IS PRIMARILY AN INSURANCE POLICY SO THEY'RE TWO DIFFERENT. TYPES OF. MARKET MECHANISMS WE SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT HOW MUCH STORAGE DO WE NEED- OUR ESTIMATES ARE WE GOING TO NEED ABOUT A QUARTER OF A TERAWATT HOUR FOR DIURNAL STORAGE. THE WORST CASE I FIND FOR SEASONAL STORAGE COULD BE ABOUT 10% OF THE ANNUAL LOAD. I DON'T THINK THIS IS LIKELY I THINK THAT IF WE BUILD MORE SOLAR SO THAT WE CAN MEET THE NEED TO GENERATE. HYDROGEN THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY AND IF WE DO IT SMARTLY IT GETS COMPLICATED BUT I CAN TELL YOU. I THINK WE CAN GET DOWN TO THE AMOUNT OF SEASONAL STORAGE WE NEED WOULD BE LESS THAN 1% OF THE AND A LOAD- WHAT TECHNOLOGIES. I DIDN'T TALK ABOUT BATTERIES I DID TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE OTHERS FOR THE SEASONAL STORAGE WE'RE LOOKING AT MORE THE CHEMICAL STORAGE. AND WE ALSO NEED TO BE THINKING ABOUT THAT WE NEED TO HAVE THESE TYPES OF THINGS LIKE HYDROGEN THAT WILL BE USING FOR TRANSPORTATION AND INDUSTRIAL. SO WE DON'T NEED TO HAVE A SEPARATE RESERVOIR THAT'S JUST FOR THE POWER SECTOR. WE CAN USE THAT SAME RESERVOIR THEY WERE USING TO DRIVE ALL THESE ENERGY SECTORS TO PROVIDE THE SEASONAL STORAGE FOR THE POWER SECTOR- AND THEN FINALLY THE OTHER SOLUTIONS I THINK THE OBVIOUS THING TO DO IS TO USE RENEWABLE ELECTRICITY SOURCES. THAT ARE BUILT OUT AT A LEVEL THAT WILL ALSO MEET NOT JUST OUR CURRENT- ELECTRICITY LOADS. BUT ALSO THE NEW LOADS LIKE ELECTROLYSIS AND SOME OF THOSE LOADS HAVE MORE FLEXIBILITY- AND SO WE DON'T NEED TO AND MAYBE. USE THEM AS FREQUENTLY BUT WE CAN- COUPLE TOGETHER THE RENEWABLE ELECTRICITY WITH THE DEMAND MANAGEMENT THESE HUGE LOADS CAN GREATLY REDUCE THE SIZE OF THE SEASONAL STORAGE WE NEED. I'M AND THANK YOU IT'S A REAL PLEASURE- TO BE HERE LET ME SEE IF I CAN FIGURE OUT HOW TO. CONSTRUCTION I'M THANK YOU AND AGAIN- I- URGE- STUDENTS- PEOPLE GOING TO SCHOOL TODAY. TO DEFINITELY TALK TO DOCTOR KURTZ- AN EXTRAORDINARY WOMAN- AND EXTRAORDINARY- PROJECT. SO MISTER BENNETT YOU ARE THE FIRST ONE UP TO ASK A QUESTION. I HAVE SOME OF MY QUESTIONS OVER THERE SO I MAY ASK AGAIN. YES GOOD MOVE BACK AND FORTH ANYTIME BUT LET ME LET I FIFTY EIGHT GET THAT SHE SHE THE DOCTOR ANSWERED ONE OF MY QUESTIONS WHICH WAS THE WHOLE ISSUE OF WHAT'S THE QUANTITY OF. OF STORAGE NEEDED AND SO YOU'VE YOU'VE YOU'VE GIVEN UP THE BASIC PARAMETERS LOOKING FOR THEIR- A QUESTION I HAVE THOUGH ABOUT THE HYDROGEN I'M INTRIGUED- BY THE IDEA OF. PRODUCING HYDROGEN WHEN YOU HAVE THE EXCESS SOLAR BECAUSE THEN. IT'S NOT AS COSTLY IN THAT SITUATION IS THERE ANY PROBLEM WITH LONG TERM STORAGE OF HYDROGEN. YES STORAGE OF HYDROGEN IS A BIG DEAL HOWEVER THERE IS THE POSSIBILITY OF USING UNDERGROUND STORAGE. MUCH LIKE WHAT WE'RE USING NATURAL GAS UNDERGROUND STORAGE THERE'S THE POSSIBILITY OF USING THAT SAME TYPE OF LOW COST STORAGE THERE AND THEY'RE PEOPLE WHO. ESPECIALLY IN UTAH THERE'S A BIG PROJECT DOING THAT NOW AS LONG AS WE'RE USING OUR UNDERGROUND STORAGE FOR NATURAL GAS IT MAY BE MORE DIFFICULT BUT EVENTUALLY. WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO DEVELOP THE RESOURCES WE NEED TO DO THE UNDERGROUND STORAGE. SO BE SIDE UNDERGROUND STORAGE IS THERE I MEAN DOES HYDROGEN SIMPLY HYDROGEN IN A TANK OF LAST FOR SIX MONTHS OR- A YEAR CAN AT LAST THAT LONG OR IS THERE SOME LIMITED AMOUNT OF TIME HYDROGEN CAN LAST. I REALLY DON'T KNOW I DON'T HAVE AN- BASIC IDEA ON THAT AT ALL. SO I WOULD SUGGEST THAT YOU THINK ABOUT THREE PRIMARY WAYS TO STORE HYDROGEN. ONE IS YOU CAN STORE IT UNDER HIGH PRESSURE. AND IF YOU GO INTO THE UNDERGROUND CAVERN YOU WILL PUT IT UNDER PRESSURE- YOU CAN ALSO THEN WHEN YOU TAKE IT OUT WHEN YOU PUT IT SAY INTO A VEHICLE OR TO TRANSPORT IT AROUND YOU CAN PUT IT IN A CYLINDER WHERE IT'S UNDER HIGH PRESSURE. ANOTHER AT THE OTHER EXTREME IS TO LIQUEFY IT AND OF COURSE AS A CRYOGENIC LIQUID. SO IF YOU HAVE A WELL SEALED VESSEL THE HIGH PRESSURE CAN LAST FOR A LONG TIME THE LEAKAGE RATES CAN BE QUITE LOW. IF YOU HAVE THE CRYOGENIC LIQUID IT GETS MORE COMPLICATED BECAUSE IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO KEEP THE TEMPERATURE LOS. SO YOU WILL SEE THAT YOU EITHER HAVE TO CONTINUE TO CHILL IT SO THAT IT DOESN'T WARM UP AND BOIL AWAY. OR YOU WILL HAVE. SOME LOSS WITH THE LIQUID HYDROGEN. NOW THE THIRD ONE THAT'S VERY INTERESTING IS THAT THERE IS. THE POSSIBILITY OF USING A METAL HYDRIDE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT WHERE YOU CAN STORE IT AND EFFECTIVELY ROOM TEMPERATURE OR JUST A LITTLE BIT BELOW ROOM TEMPERATURE. AT A SOMEWHAT ELEVATED PRESSURE. AND THEN WHEN YOU WANT TO BRING IT OUT YOU WARM IT UP A LITTLE BIT AND THEN- TAKE IT OUT. AT A PRESSURE THAT'S CLOSER AND THAT'S A MUCH LOWER PRESSURE THAN WHAT YOU WOULD USE IN A BIG CYLINDER. THAT TECHNOLOGY IS NOW BEING COMMERCIALIZED AND IT'S AGAIN IN MORE OF A DEVELOPMENT STAGE. IT MAY BE MORE DIFFICULT TO SCALE BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO GET A LOT OF- METAL HYDRIDE MATERIAL BUT IT HAS THE POTENTIAL. TO ALSO GIVE YOU SOME LOCAL STORAGE WHICH MAKES IT EASIER IF YOU DON'T HAVE AN UNDERGROUND CAVERN CITY UNDERGROUND. I'M I'M INTERESTED BUT THEN A LITTLE WHILE TO. BURDEN YOU WHICH I DIDN'T GET INTO ALL OF THE REST OF THIS RIGHT NOW GIVEN OUR TIME CONSTRAINTS BUT- I'M INTERESTED IN THE IN. TRYING TO SEE HOW MUCH VARIETY WE CAN CREATE AND STORAGE OPTIONS FOR HYDROGEN- IF IT IS GOING TO BE A- AN IMPORTANT SOURCE FORCED A MORE VARIETY WE HAVE IN TERMS OF STORY UP STORAGE OPTIONS. OBVIOUSLY THE MORE APPLICABLES DALY THE ENERGY SOURCE COULD BE. AND COULD BE USED AND COULD BE APPLIED GEOGRAPHICALLY ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THANK YOU. I'D AND I'D LOOK REALLY LIKE TO ADD THEIR I REALLY INTRIGUING WHEN THERE'S SO MANY INNOVATIONS OUT THERE ONE IS THAT YOU CAN TAKE AN OLD OIL WELL. AND YOU CAN- CAP OFF THE PART OF THE WELL THAT IS. INTO THE POOREST ROCK SO THAT YOU CAN SEAL IT UP AND THEN YOU CAN USE THAT SHAFT THAT'S USED IN THE OIL WELL. AS A WAY OF STORING THE HYDROGEN. AND SO IT'S ACTUALLY SOME OF THE OIL COMPANIES ARE INTERESTED IN BEING ABLE TO- YOU SAID YOU CAN EITHER. USE THEM TO STORE THE HYDROGEN OR YOU CAN PUT A BIG WEIGHT AND INTO A GRAVITY STORAGE AND ACTIVE. IN IT IF YOU IF YOU USE IN THE STORE THE HYDROGEN. YOU HAVE TO DO IT UNDER PRESSURE YOU DON'T HAVE TO REFRIGERATE OR YOU HAPPEN TO. GREAT IT'S AS LONG AS JUST UNDER PRESSURE YOU DON'T HAVE TO REFRIGERATE. THAT'S RIGHT GREAT THANK YOU OKAY THANK. I THANK YOU MISTER BENNETT- OF THE T. F. MISTER CALDERON. YEAH ALL RIGHT ARM. THE SO I HAVE SOME- CLARIFICATION SO WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT 1% OF THE ANNUAL LOAN FIRST OF ALL DURING THE WINTER TIME IN CALIFORNIA R. WELL DURING THE SUMMER OUR MAXIMUM POWER AND AGAIN PEOPLE GET CONFUSED BETWEEN POWER AND ENERGY SO THE AMOUNT OF POWER WE GENERATE. AT PEAK IS AROUND FIFTY GIGAWATTS. AND JUST KNOW THAT THE NUMBER IS FIFTY IT'S A BIG NUMBER. BOB PROBABLY THE AVERAGE FOR THE YEAR IS I DON'T KNOW WE'LL WE'LL JUST DO THIS SAY FORTY. SOMETHING LIKE THAT- FORTY GIGAWATTS. AND SO ONE WELL YOU'RE GONNA NEED TO GENERATE POWER ON THE ORDER OF TENS OF GIGAWATTS DURING THE WINTER MARC MOST LIKELY DEPENDING ON. HI THE EXTENT TO WHICH YOU MIGHT HAVE GEOTHERMAL OR SOMETHING ELSE IT'S BASE LOAD BUT THE LACK OF SOLAR YOU'RE YOU'RE GOING TO DATE ON THE ORDER OF TEN OR SO GIGAWATTS. OF POWER. AND YOU'RE SAYING THAT THE AMOUNT OF STORAGE SO. THE AMOUNT OF ENERGY WE USE IS. FORTY GIGAWATT TIMES THE NUMBER OF TIMES THE TIME IN A YEAR. 1% IS ABOUT THREE DAYS- OF THAT SO WE'RE REALLY TALKING ABOUT. GENERATING TENS OF GIGAWATTS FOR THE EQUIVALENT OF. SO THREE DAYS TIMES- FORTY AROUND A HUNDRED AND TWENTY GIGAWATT HOURS- OF STORAGE THAT'S THAT'S A HUGE NUMBER. AND I JUST WANT TO SAY HOW BIG THAT IS- YOU KNOW ALL THE HYDRO WE HAVE IN THE STATE IS YOU KNOW. IF YOU GET A LOT- AND IT RUNS. FOR- A MONTH OR TWO- LET'S SAY SIXTY DAYS YOU KNOW. YES THE NUMBERS ARE JUST OFF THE SCALE COMPARED TO ANYTHING ELSE WE DO AND YOU'RE ALSO POINTING OUT. THAT THE ECONOMICS IS SUCH THAT YOU'RE GOING TO NEED TO HAVE AS WITH NATURAL GAS SOME AMOUNT THAT'S JUST THERE FOR SECURITY THAT YOU PROBABLY NEVER WILL YEARS. AND THEN AN AMOUNT. WHICH YOU WILL USE WHICH IS ALREADY A LARGE NUMBER. AND JUST GET PEOPLE USED TO THE IDEA THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SCALES THAT WE JUST DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT. THE END QUESTION IS GOING TO BE WHAT'S THE CHEAPEST WAY TO DO THIS. AND THERE ARE OTHER TECHNOLOGIES THAT THERE JUST WASN'T TIME TO GET INTO. BUT PART OF THAT IS GOING TO BE EFFICIENCY. SO LET'S SAY YOU'RE STORING HYDROGEN- NOT QUITE BUT WHEN YOU WHEN YOU ELECTROLYSIS EYES WATER INTO HYDROGEN OR WHAT'S THE EFFICIENCY OF THAT APPROXIMATELY. SO IT CAN VARY BUT- YOU MAY HAVE AN EFFICIENCY JUST FOR THEIR THE CONVERSION TO HYDROGEN CAN BE APPROACHING SOMETHING LIKE 70% 70% AND THEN AT THAT. IF WE CAN GET AND THEN THE BEST. CONVERTING IT BACK INTO ELECTRICITY YOU'RE GOING TO GET MORE LOSSES PROBABLY ANOTHER THAT PASSED ANOTHER 70% EFFICIENCY YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A LOSS OF ABOUT HALF. OF THE ENERGY IS GENERATED JUST FOR AND IT MAY BE THE ROUND TRIP EFFICIENCY WILL PROBABLY BETWEEN 30% AND 50% FOR THE HYDROGEN. AND FOR THE OTHERS- THAT YOU MENTIONED TO THE- COMPRESSED AIR IS ROUND TRIP THE COMPRESSED AIR WILL BE LOWER IF THEY MAY BE ABLE TO MAKE MORE LIKE 65% THE- THE QUICK NAPS APPROACH WITH THE GM MECHANICAL MAY BE ABLE TO APPROACH. I'M MORE LIKE 75% EIGHTY PERCENT. SEVENTY FIVE OR RIGHT BUT IT'S HIGHER THAN IT SHOULD BOTH OF. ENJOYING HIGHER THAN HYDROGEN ARM. AGAIN GET A HOUSE EXPENSIVE IS IT GONNA BE TO. OUR STORE ANY OF THESE BUT OUR- THERE'S A LOT WE NEED TO DO WE WERE GOING TO NEED TO HAVE THESE PLANTS AND ONE OF THE THINGS I WAS VERY IMPRESSED WITH IS THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE DOING THIS NOW. AND THAT IS GREAT- THERE WILL OF COURSE BE QUESTIONS ABOUT BY THE WAY NO MATTER WHAT WE DO WE WILL NEED HYDROGEN FOR SOME THINGS PARTICULARLY INDUSTRIAL AREN'T THAT INDUSTRIAL- ELEMENT SO WE WILL BE PRODUCING HYDROGEN WHETHER IT'S USED FOR STORAGE OR SOMETHING ELSE- ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. YES MISTER BENNETT. GOOD. I WANT TO LOWER THE RATE HI THIS. IS. I THEY ARE OFTEN LEFT AFTER TRANSPORTATION. RECITED AS WE GET MORE OUT. I'M SORRY I'M A START OVER AGAIN BECAUSE YOU COULDN'T HEAR I COULD SEE YOU LEADING AND I DIDN'T HAVE MY- MICROPHONE BECAUSE HYDROGEN HAS A LOWER EFFICIENCY RATE. THAN THE OTHER TECHNOLOGIES THAT YOU JUST MENTIONED IT- AT SIXTY FIVE AND PROTECT SEVENTY FIVE TO POTENTIALLY EIGHTY. WHILE IT HAS A LOWER EFFICIENCY RATE IT HAS A GREATER APPLICABILITY TO TRANSPORTATION AND OTHER ITEMS SO WE'RE GOING TO BEG PRODUCING THAT ANYWAY. SO I WOULD BE CURIOUS OF SOME KIND OF ANALYSIS OF THE ECONOMIES OF OF CREATING THE HYDROGEN. WELL IF YOU'RE GONNA GO TO THE TROUBLE OF TRADING IT FOR OTHER THINGS DONE WHAT'S THE MARGINAL COST OF CREATING SOME MORE FOR STORAGE FOR. OF THE ELECTRIC GRID VERSES. INVESTING IN A NEW TECHNOLOGY OR AYE AYE AYE WHICH COME FROM THE STANDPOINT OF RESILIENCY AND WHAT HAVE SOME OF ALL BUT- BUT- THAT WILL THAT PART OF THE ANALYSIS WOULD BE SOMETHING I'D BE INTERESTED IN. DOWN THE ROAD AND I KNOW YOU CAN'T GET INTO ALL THAT RIGHT NOW BUT- IN MY ACCURATE THAT THERE WOULD BE MORE APPLICATIONS AT THIS POINT IN TIME IT LOOKS LIKE THE HYDROGEN AND THE OTHER TECHNOLOGIES. STORAGE TECHNOLOGIES. THANK I BELIEVE AND THAT'S DEFINITELY TRUE AND I'D LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOU A FUN VISION JUST TO STIMULATE YOUR INNOVATION I THINK THE FUTURE IS GOING TO BE VERY DEPENDENT UPON. THE EXTENT TO WHICH WE CAN INNOVATE AND COME UP WITH DIFFERENT IDEAS. LET'S SAY THAT WE USE HYDROGEN TO- DRIVE ARE BIG TRUCKS THAT GO ACROSS THE COUNTRY. AND OTHER TRUCK THEN CAN LOAD UP WITH A BIG LOAD OF HYDROGEN THEY COULD EVEN POTENTIALLY BE A TRUCK THAT CARRIES HYDROGEN AROUND IN LARGE QUANTITIES. AND THEY HAVE A FUEL CELL ON BOARD THAT'S USED TO CONVERT THE HYDROGEN. TO ELECTRICITY IN ORDER TO MAKE THE TRUCK GO. IN ADDITION WE HAVE A SITUATION LIKE WHAT TEXAS HAD OR LIKE IF NEXT WEEK WE GOT A HUGE- HEAT STORM ACROSS ALL OF THE WESTERN AND- CALIFORNIA WAS HAVING DIFFICULTY. IF YOU'RE A TRUCK DRIVER YOU MEMBER IN TEXAS THEY WERE PAYING NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS A MEGAWATT HOUR- WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO LOAD YOUR TRUCK UP WITH HYDROGEN AND THEN DRIVE DOWN THERE AND THEN HOOK YOUR FUEL CELL UP TO THE GREAT AND USE THE VEHICLE TO GREAT KIND OF CONCEPT. I CALL IT A TICKER PLANT ON WHEELS. I'M MOST OF THE TIME YOU'RE JUST USING THAT TRUCK TO. DELIVER OTHER GOODS. BUT THAT TRUCK NOW COULD BE USED TO DRIVE THE GREAT IN A PINCH AND IF YOU PAID SOMEBODY NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS A MEGAWATT HOUR THINK THEY GO HOOK UP THE TRUCK AND TAKE A NAP- WELL THE- RECENT RESTOCK THE GREAT WITH ELECTRICITY AND CAN STAND CHARGE UP THE LITHIUM BATTERIES AND THINGS THAT ARE SITTING THERE. I'M GLAD YOU PUT THAT IS THAT IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'VE- BEEN INTRIGUED ABOUT IS THAT HYDROGEN CAN MOVE. FAIRLY EASILY. BY TRUCK TO TWO PLACES WHERE IT IS NEEDED RIGHT AND- THANK YOU. EXCELLENT QUESTION AGAIN THANK YOU SO MUCH AND- I OFTEN TALKED HIS PHD IN ASTROPHYSICS I TALK TO PEOPLE ABOUT GOING TO SCHOOL AND WHAT IS IT YOU REALLY WANT TO DO AND AGAIN. CONSIDER UC MERCED JUST SAY. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH PROFESSOR AND WILL GO ON TO THE NEXT PANEL. CHAU OUR NEXT PANEL WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM EXPERTS ABOUT THE CHALLENGES OF COMMERCIALIZING ENERGY STORAGE TECHNOLOGIES. WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM THREE PEOPLE- ALEX MORRIS FOR THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY STORAGE ALLIANCE. A DOCTOR SCOTT BURGER FROM A FOUR BANERJEE WILL TALK TO US ABOUT THE CHALLENGES OF TAKING ENERGY STORAGE TECHNOLOGIES FROM OUR ANTI- THREE DEVELOPMENT. AND FINALLY WE'RE GOING TO BE JOINED BY DR RAVI UP PRESSURE FROM LAWRENCE BERKELEY LAB TO SHARE WITH US. HOW TO RAPIDLY SCALE INNOVATIVE ENERGY STORAGE TECHNOLOGIES EACH ONE OF THESE WILL SPEAK FOR SEVEN MINUTES- ALEX MORGAN ALEX. MORRIS COMES FROM US AGAIN EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY STORAGE ALLIANCE- HE HAS TREMENDOUS EXPERIENCE HAVING WORKED AT OF THE CALIFORNIA- INDEPENDENT SYSTEMS OPERATOR THAT OPERATES ARE GRADED- THE FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION FOR. AND OTHER ENERGY AND OTHER- AGENCIES SO COMES TO US WITH A LOT OF EXPERIENCE AND- WORKED IN THE PLUG IN VEHICLES RATE DESIGN SMART GRAY A DIALECTIC TRANSPORTATION. RENEWABLE INTEGRATION MARKET DESIGNED STORAGE- LEGISLATION CALIFORNIA STORAGE INITIATIVE AT CETERA ET CETERA. SO- HE HAS- HE'S WORKED FOR ELECTRICAL UTILITIES PACIFIC GAS AND ELECTRIC SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON AND HAS AN MBA FROM UC DAVIS. SO MISTER MORRIS- PLEASE JOIN US. I SOMEWHERE REQUIRE CAN YOU HEAR ME OK YEAH YEAH RIGHT WELL I EVERYONE AND THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY IT'S GREAT TO JOIN YOU AND I AGAIN I COME FROM A CALIFORNIA ENERGY STORAGE ALLIANCE AND IF IT'S OKAY I'LL SHARE A FEW SLIDES JUST TO GUIDE MY REMARKS. YEAH YES THANK CURRENTLY NOT ABLE TO SHARE CONTENT WHICH IS PROBABLY OKAY I CAN WING IT- YEAH BUT IF THAT GETS ACTIVATED ALL PULL UP THE SLIDES. SO AGAIN C. SAYS THE VOICE OF ENERGY STORAGE IN CALIFORNIA IRAN'S. WE REPRESENT ABOUT A HUNDRED MEMBERS ALL OF WHOM ARE VERY ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN STORAGE MARKET IN CALIFORNIA. AND YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO SEE MY SLIDES NOW. OKAY. YEAH AND- SO YEAH WE'RE A NONPROFIT TRADE ASSOCIATION THAT'S VERY ACTIVE IN ALL OF THE MAJOR AGENCIES IN CALIFORNIA AS MANY OF YOU KNOW THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY STORAGE- MARKET IS ONE OF THE LARGEST IN THE WORLD IN SO AS WE GO FORWARD AND FIGURE THINGS OUT AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO SUPPORT IN SB ONE HUNDRED WERE OFTEN ON THE FRONT LINES IT NAVIGATING PROBLEMS THEY'VE NEVER BEEN DEALT WITH A GREAT EXAMPLE IS HEARING FROM GAVE EARLIER AT THE CASE SO ABOUT HOW THEY'RE DEVELOPING MARKET PARTICIPATION PATHS FOR ENERGY STORAGE. AND BUILDING A LEVEL OF CONFIDENCE AND HOW THESE RESOURCES WILL PERFORM IN A VERY COMPLICATED ENERGY MARKET OPTIMIZATION SO IT'S ALWAYS FUN TO BE HERE BUT THEN OCCASIONALLY WE ALSO WORK WITH FEDERAL REGULATORS AND FEDERAL ENERGY POLICY MATTERS TO HELP BRING THE REST OF THE COUNTRY- ALONG THIS JOURNEY- AND THAT CALIFORNIA'S OFTEN LEADING IN- THIS IS A MEMBERS TYPICALLY ARE REALLY. THE MOST SERIOUS AND SOPHISTICATED ENERGY PLAYERS IN THE WORLD AND- TO DOCTOR KURTZ IT WAS GREAT TO. SEE YOU- YOUR TAKE ON SO MANY OF THE SEASON MEMBERS INCLUDING HIVE YOU AND HIGH RESTORING QUITE IN THAT- AND WE HAVE HYDROGEN MEMBERS AND MANY MEMBERS WHO ARE FOCUSING ON IT AND I SHARE THIS SLIDE BECAUSE- I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS CALIFORNIA'S DOING WELL AT IS. CREATING MARKETS AND IS DEFINING NEEDS FOR THE ELECTRIC SYSTEM AND THEN THE STORAGE COMPANIES AND THIS IS HOW SEIZE OPERATES WE WANT THEM TO COMPETE SO WE BASICALLY HELP THEM UNDERSTAND. THE CALIFORNIA MARKET AND TO THE EXTENT APPROPRIATE AS INDUSTRY WE TRY TO HAVE A VOICE HERE BUT THEN WE EXPECT THEM TO SHOW UP AND COMPETE AND DELIVER GOOD COMPETITIVE AND COST EFFECTIVE SERVICES FOR CALIFORNIANS. SO THESE REALLY ARE THE MEMBERS THAT AND IT'S A GREAT PRIVILEGE TO WORK AND I WANT TO TELL YOU ALL AS MEMBERS OF OUR LEGISLATURE HOW IMPORTANT YOUR WORK IS BECAUSE- EACH ONE OF THESE COMPANIES IS. VERY FOCUSED ON CALIFORNIA THEY KNOW THAT CALIFORNIA IS A PLACE THAT THEY CAN AND SHOULD FOCUS ON FOR BUSINESS. AND SO THEY'RE TRULY DEPLOYING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. TO GEAR UP IN PROVIDE SERVICES HERE AND THAT COMES FROM YOUR POLICY SIGNALS. SO IT'S AN IMPORTANT SIGNAL THAT YOU CREATE THEN INDUSTRY IS RESPONDING. I THOUGHT AS I GET INTO WHAT THE COMMERCIALIZATION CHALLENGES ARE I JUST WANT TO REMIND EVERYONE I THINK THIS IS BEEN CLEAR THAT. THAT THE SCALE OF STORAGE NEEDS IN THE SCALE OF THIS PROBLEM ARE MASSIVE JUST TRULY MASSIVE. AND IN A SINGLE DECISION. THIS YEAR THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION DIRECTED PROCUREMENT OF RESOURCES THAT WILL INCLUDE STORAGE. AND NOT SINGLE DECISION WAS BIGGER THAN IT WASN'T AMOUNT BIGGER THAN MANY UTILITIES IN THE COUNTRY SO OUR SINGLE DECISION FOR- ELEVEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED MEGAWATTS. IS BIGGER THAN THE ENTIRE UTILITY OF LADWP SO THAT GIVES YOU A SENSE OF THE SCALE. OF HOW WE'RE GONNA BE ADDING STORAGE WE'RE GONNA BE ADDING THOUSANDS OF MEGAWATTS OF SOLAR THOUSANDS OF MEGAWATTS OF STORAGE PER YEAR. AND I SHARE ALL OF THIS BECAUSE AS WE LOOK AT THE COMMERCIALIZATION WHAT I THINK THIS- COMMITTEE SHOULD FOCUS ON PARTICULAR WITH SEASONAL STORAGE IS THAT. WE HAVE A HUGE PROBLEM. TAKE YOUR OUT FOR AND WE'RE GONNA BE SPENDING A LOT OF MONEY ON IT AS CALIFORNIANS AND I OF COURSE LIVE HERE AND SO YOU KNOW I REALLY WANT US TO MAKE SURE THE TOOL KIT IS READY AND SO- SOMETHING OR PERHAPS SHOULD THE CHANCE TO FOCUS ON. COME DEALING WITH THE VALLEY OF DEATH AND REALLY WHAT I WOULD SAY IS GETTING THE TOOL KIT READY SO THAT WE HAVE ALL OF THESE. TECHNOLOGIES READY TO COMPETE WHICH WILL ULTIMATELY BRING COSTS DOWN WHEN IT COMES TIME FOR US TO REALLY BE BUYING. SO THIS IS A SMART AND TIMELY MATTER AND WE'RE HAPPY TO PARTICIPATE. REALLY FROM THE INDUSTRY SIDE I WANT TO TELL YOU THOUGH. IT IS TOUGH TO GO FROM SMALL SCALE ARE INDEED TO- BIG SCALE AND WE HAVE MANY OF THESE COMPANIES THAT ARE JOCKEYING TO PROVIDE SERVICES HERE IN CALIFORNIA. YET BECAUSE THEY ONLY HAD A FEW. BITES AT THE APPLE OR A FEW PROJECTS IN THE GROUND THEY DON'T YET HAVE. EVERYTHING TUNED AND THAT'S WHAT I MEAN BY EVERYTHING I MEAN. THEY DON'T HAVE THE BANKS. READY TO LEND TO THEM AT COMPETITIVE PRICES BECAUSE THE BANKS HAVEN'T SEEN THEIR TECHNOLOGY PERFORM YET. THEY DON'T HAVE THE INSURANCE PROVIDERS. READY TO LET- PROVIDES WARRANTY SERVICES OR TO PUT TOGEHER AN INSURANCE PACKAGE IN A MONTH. BECAUSE OFTEN WHEN YOU'RE COMPETING TO PROVIDE SERVICES IN CALIFORNIA. YOU HAVE TO YOU PUT YOUR BITS TOGETHER IN RESPONSE TO A UTILITY OR A CCA. REQUEST FOR OFFERS WITHIN. THIRTY TO SIXTY DAYS AND SO IT'S HARD. ESPECIALLY FOR THE NEW TECHNOLOGIES TO HAVE ALL THEIR DUCKS IN A ROW TO COMPETE SO QUICKLY. AND SO- WORK WHERE I GENERALLY LAND WITH THIS IS THAT. YOU KNOW- MORE SUPPORT IS NEEDED- THIS SLIDE HIGHLIGHTS THAT. AS WE MOVE TOWARDS DECARBONISATION THE NEEDS ARE JUST SO BIG. THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO TAKE IT REALLY SERIOUSLY AND SEE SAYS EVEN STUDY THE CASE THAT DOCTOR KIRK MENTIONED ABOUT- LOW SOLAR RADIATION AND NO IN THE WINTERTIME AND YOU HEARD- MR MURDOCH FROM K. SO EMPHASIZE THE NEED FOR WINTER. CAPABILITY AND WE HAVE A STUDY THAT SHOWS- YOU KNOW WILL NEED. TENS OF THOUSANDS OF MEGAWATTS OF LONG DURATION AND SEASONAL STORAGE. AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT SENSITIVITY CASES WITH GREENHOUSE GASES AND EXTREME WEATHER. IT GETS EVEN MORE SERIOUS. SO VERY QUICKLY AND I LOOK FORWARD ANY QUESTIONS WHAT I WOULD SUGGEST IS OUT OF FOCUS ON THE TOOL KIT AND GETTING EVERYONE READY TO COMPETE AS WE GET INTO PRIME TIME. AND I THINK OUR CC EPIC PROGRAM HAS DONE A GREAT JOB OF THAT FOR SMALLER. OBJECT BUT WE REALLY NEED TO FOCUS NOW ON A GETTING A DIVERSE TOOL KIT READY FOR COMMERCIAL SCALE PROJECTS. AND THAT OFTEN MEANS- HELPING THEM OVERCOME THIS INITIAL GREEN PREMIUM AND SCALING TECHNOLOGIES AT FIVE TO TWENTY FIVE MEGAWATTS ARE LARGER. AND THEN ALSO LOOKING AT SOMEBODY'S UP TECHNOLOGY DIVERSITY BENEFITS IN ANTICIPATING THAT THAT WILL BE VALUABLE TO US. IN FINDING WAYS TO PROCURE- SOMEBODY THAT TECHNOLOGY WE DON'T HAVE VERY MUCH OF LIKE THE VERY LARGE OR THE ALTERNATIVE TECHNOLOGIES. WE HEARD OF HIGH RESTORE HIVE YOU IN QUICK NAP AND REALLY HELPING FIND MARKET OPPORTUNITIES FOR THOSE. THERE'S OTHER WAYS WE CAN DO THIS TOO IN THE ON THE POLICY FRONT HERE AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO. WORKING WITH YOU ON THAT SO THAT'LL WRAP UP MY REMARKS AND DR IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE HERE THANK YOU. AND IT'S I'LL JUST TAKE A MINUTE TO SAY I'VE KNOWN ALEX SINCE HE STARTED- REALLY STARTED THIS- ASSOCIATION- HE IS- IN THE SAME CALL HEART. CO HEART OF IDEALISTIC PEOPLE LIKE MY SON WHO WE KNEW WHAT PG&amp;E. WHO ARE OUT THERE MY SENSE NOW WITH APPLE. TRYING TO CHANGE THE WORLD- YOU KNOW I'M NOT GOING TO BE AROUND WHEN THE WORST OF- OF THE GLOBAL WARMING HITS US IN ANOTHER TWENTY THIRTY YEARS BUT- THESE GENTLEMEN WILL BE MY SON. ALEX AND- THEY WANT A DIFFERENT WORLD. AND WE HAVE TO BE INSPIRED BY PEOPLE LIKE ALEX WHO ARE. YOU KNOW STE STARTING FROM NOTHING AND HELPING US FINDER SOLUTIONS SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH ALEX- WE WILL NOW HAVE THE IF THERE'S NO FURTHER QUESTIONS ARM I WILL. START WITH OUR NEXT PERSON DR SCOTT BURGER FROM FORM ENERGY IS TELL US ABOUT THE CHALLENGES OF TAKING THAT ENERGY STORAGE TECHNOLOGY FROM R. AND D. THROUGH DEPLOYMENT FROM A START UP PERSPECTIVE- JUST TO SAY A FEW WORDS- HE IS BESIDES BEING A SENIOR MANAGER AT- FOR MANAGING AND LEADING THE ANALYTICS TEAM- HE'S BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR DEVELOPING AND DELIVERING THE ELECTRICITY MARKET AND PROJECT MODELING AND DATA SCIENCE. THE POWERS FORMS COMMERCIAL STRATEGY BATTERY PRODUCT MANAGEMENT POLICY AND REGULATORY AFFAIRS- AND HE WILL AS A FELLOW AT THE WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM- GLOBAL FUTURE COUNCIL ON ENERGY AND LECTURER IN IT. M. I. T. ARM AND HIS RESEARCH AT MIT FOCUSED ON IMPROVING THE- EQUITY. OF THE- TO DECENTRALIZED ENERGY SYSTEMS. SO MISTER DOCTOR BERGER- PLEASE COME FORWARD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- GOOD AFTERNOON ASSEMBLY MEMBER WORK AND- THE OTHER DISTINGUISHED MEMBERS PANELISTS AND GUESTS IT'S REALLY GREAT TO BE HERE. AND AS DR JUST MENTIONED I READ OUR ANALYTICS TEAM INFORM ENERGY AND SO OUR TEAM BASICALLY BUILDS COMPUTER MODELS AND USES TOOLS THAT WE'VE DEVELOPED IN HOUSE OR EXTERNALLY TO HELP OURSELVES AND OUR CUSTOMERS UNDERSTAND AND COMMUNICATE THE VALUE OF THE PRODUCT THAT WE'RE DEVELOPING- I'M GONNA START BY INTRODUCING FOR MANAGING AND- YOU KNOW WHO WE ARE AND- WHY WE'RE DOING WHAT WE'RE DOING. AND THEN I'M GONNA GET INTO KIND OF SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT AS THIS PANEL SPOKE A SIGN. THAT WE FACE AND COMMERCIALIZING NEW AND LONG DURATION OR MULTI DAY STORAGE TECHNOLOGIES. AND THEN END WITH YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK ARE SOME OF THE BENEFITS TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ARE THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ACTING. THE SONGS AND THESE CHALLENGES- SO A BIT ABOUT FOR MANAGING YOU KNOW WHO WE ARE WHY WE'RE HERE I FOR MANAGING AS THE COMPANY WAS FOUNDED IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN BY A SET OF INDUSTRY STORAGE VETERANS SO FOLKS FROM COMPANIES LIKE HAS LINE ACREE ON AND- A ONE TWO THREE AND- I TRY- INDUSTRIES AND YOU KNOW A NUMBER OF OTHER I BASICALLY. HAVE- STORY COMPANIES AND ENERGY STORAGE SECTOR- AND REALLY CAME TOGETHER TO SOLVE- ONE CORE PROBLEM IS YOU KNOW HOW DO WE COMMERCIALIZE TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPED AND COMMERCIALIZED TECHNOLOGY THAT ENABLES A FULLY ELECTRIC. ARE FULLY RENEWABLE ELECTRIC CREDIT. EXTENDED WEATHER EVENTS THESE KIND OF EVENTS THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT- THROUGHOUT THIS THIS- SESSION. OUR FIRST PRODUCT OUR FIRST COMMERCIAL PRODUCT IS A RICH CHARGEABLE IRON AIR BATTERY. THAT IS CAPABLE OF CONTINUOUSLY DISCHARGING ELECTRICITY FOR ONE HUNDRED HOURS THAT'S A LITTLE OVER FOUR DAYS. AT SYSTEM COST COMPETITIVE WITH FOSSIL FUELED POWER PLANTS. BY USING IRON WHICH IS ONE OF THE MOST ABUNDANT AND REALLY CHEAPEST MINERALS ON THE PLANET. OUR SOLUTION WE THINK CAN HELP ENABLE- COST EFFECTIVE A 100% RENEWABLE ENERGY GRID. OUR TECHNOLOGY AGAIN OUR IRON AIR BATTERIES A STATIC BATTERY THAT'S NOT A FLOW BATTERY. I IT DOESN'T INVOLVE KIND OF THE PUMPING OF- OF. OPERATOR ERROR OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT LIKE SOME OF THE OTHER MEMBERS OF OUR PANELISTS DISCUSSED- IN IN IN YOUR BEING A BATTERY IS VERY MODULAR SO YOU NOW WE DON'T RELY ON SPECIFIC GEOLOGIC FORMATIONS THAT MIGHT LIMIT- WHERE WE CAN ACTUALLY LOCATE THIS THING WE CAN WE CAN LOCATE OUR BATTERY- ANYWHERE. AND BY NATURE OF USING IRON AND OTHER KIND OF- NON HAZARDOUS- ACHE WE S. ELECTROLYTES AND OTHER MATERIALS. IT'S VERY SAFE WE DON'T HAVE THE SAME KIND OF THERMAL RUNAWAY PROBLEMS THAT WITHIN MY OWN- TECHNOLOGIES HAS OUR OUR BATTERIES CAN'T SPONTANEOUSLY COMBUST OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT- AND AGAIN IT'S VERY KIND OF- GEOGRAPHICALLY. SCALABLE AND MODULAR IN THAT SENSE- AND I GUESS JUST TO KIND OF UNDERSCORE WHY WE THINK. THAT THIS IS AN INTERESTING APPROACHES. IRON IS THE FUNDAMENTAL KIND OF STORAGE MEDIA FOR OUR TECHNOLOGY- AND IRON BEING ONE OF THE CHEAPEST AND MOST ABUNDANT MATERIALS ON THE PLANET- PRODUCED YOU KNOW IN THE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF TONS- GLOBALLY EACH YEAR ENOUGH TO. PROVIDE HUNDREDS OF GIGAWATTS OF OUR BATTERIES EVERY YEAR AND- IT THE COST OF STORING ENERGY IN THE IRON MATERIALS IS VERY VERY WELL- TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF KIND OF WHAT WE'RE TARGETING. WE EXPECT OUR BATTERIES TO BE ABLE TO STORE ENERGY AT LESS THAN ONE TENTH UP SOME SURPRISING APPROACHING ONE HUNDRED THE COST OF TODAY'S LITHIUM ION BATTERIES. SO YOU KNOW TO IT TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRKS COMMENTS EARLIER THIS REALLY IS KIND OF ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE DIFFERENT. THAN WHAT WE'RE SEEING TODAY- GIVEN THAT IRAN AIR IS NOT SOMETHING THAT THIS THIS GROUP IS PROBABLY DOT WITH BEFORE. I JUST THAT THE TINY INTRODUCTION ON THAT- ARE ARE BETTER YOU CAN REALLY THINK OF IT AS IT IS A REVERSIBLE RUST BATTERY SO ON DISCHARGING OR WHEN WE'RE- SENDING ELECTRICITY TO THE GRID. IRON REACTS WITH OXYGEN AND CREATES FROST GENERATES ELECTRICITY. WHEN ARE CHARGING THE BATTERY YEAH I RETURNS TO ITS METALLIC STATE AND LEASES OXYGEN SO THE ONLY KIND. OF PRODUCT OF THAT REACTIVE OXYGEN- WE DO SEE OURSELVES THE RIVER. FOR WITHIN MY- RATHER WE SEE OURSELVES A COMPLIMENT TO LITHIUM ION- WE KIND OF LIKE TO THINK OF OURSELVES AS WE KNOW WHEN PAIRING WITH RENEWABLE ENERGY. RENEWABLE ENERGY PLUS OUR MULTI DAY STORAGE TECHNOLOGY CAN ENABLE KIND OF BASELOAD. RENEWABLES AND LITHIUM ION IS REALLY USEFUL AS KIND OF A PEAKER BACKING ABOUT- KIND OF REPLACING. SOME OF TODAY'S REALLY. QUICK ACTING BUT SHORT RUNNING- NATURAL GAS PLANTS. WHERE WE ARE IN OUR COMMERCIALIZATION PHASES WERE IN THE PROTOTYPING PHASE. SINCE WE BOUGHT OUR FIRST GET A SELL ON TEST IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE HAVE SCALED OURSELVES ALMOST EIGHTEEN THOUSAND TIMES SO WE ARE EIGHTEEN THOUSAND TIMES LARGER THAN WE WERE- IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND WE'VE ACTUALLY BUILT NOW THE WORLD'S LARGEST- BATTERY CELL INTERNS ENERGY CAPACITY. WE EXPECT OUR FIRST- PROJECTS DEPLOYED ON THE GRID WITH MINNESOTA'S SECOND LARGEST ELECTRIC UTILITY IT'S A UTILITY COLOR GREAT RIVER ENERGY. AND THIS PROJECT WILL BE A ONE MEGAWATT ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MEGAWATT HOUR OR A HUNDRED FIFTY HOUR BATTERY- THAT WILL REALLY FUNDAMENTALLY DEMONSTRATE THAT KIND OF REPEATABLE AND SCALABLE WALK OF OUR SYSTEM. WE'RE NOW ABOUT A HUNDRED AND THIRTY EMPLOYEES AND WHILE ARE HEADQUARTERED IN SOMERVILLE MASSACHUSETTS OUR OUR SECOND LARGEST OFFICE IS IN THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA. AND THAT'S YOU KNOW NOT BY SURPRISES- ALEX JUST MOMENTS AGO MENTIONED- YOU KNOW WE ARE CHOOSING TO SCALE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BECAUSE REALLY THE SUPPORTIVE POLICY ENVIRONMENTS ALL OF THAT KIND OF ENGINEERING TALENT THAT IS DEVELOPED THERE OVER THE YEARS AS- THE STATE HAS DEVELOPED A REALLY VIBRANT. RENEWABLE ENERGY AND ENERGY STORAGE SECTOR- SO THAT'S A BIT ABOUT FORM. YOU KNOW. I THINK I'M GONNA TOUCH BRIEFLY ON THE PROBLEM THAT WE'RE TRYING TO SOLVE- YOU KNOW ADDS ASSEMBLY MEMBER BURKE MENTIONED EARLIER TODAY'S BATTERY TECHNOLOGY LITHIUM ION. I HAVE REALLY KIND OF SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF BALANCING INTRADAY OF RENEWABLE ENERGY VERY ABILITY SO WE ARE REALLY GOOD TODAY AT MOVING ENERGY FROM NOON WE HAVE A LOT OF SOLAR POWER. INTO MAYBE THE EVENING PEAK HOURS- WHEN THIS YOU KNOW THE SUN IS STARTING TO SET THE DEMAND IS STILL REALLY HIGH PEOPLE ARE ARE FLIPPING ON YOUR TELEVISION CETERA. HOWEVER IN THE FUTURE. WELL I BELIEVE CHALLENGES WILL NOT BE DRIVEN BY THESE PIZZA MAN HOURS RATHER RELIABILITY CHALLENGES IN THE FUTURE WE REALLY BE DRIVEN- BY KIND OF CONTINUOUS MULTI DAY PERIODS OF LOW RENEWABLE ENERGY GENERATION. I JUST THAT THAT KIND OF. SAY THAT THIS IS NOT JUST MY OPINION- THAT THE CONSULTANCY E. THREE. WHICH IS- CONSULTANCY BASED IN IN CALIFORNIA- THAT DOES A LOT OF WORK WITH THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION TO RUN ITS INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLANNING PROCESS USE OF THE PROCESSES THAT WE USE TO UNDERSTAND. WHAT RESOURCES ARE NEEDED ON THE GROUND- SAID IN A PAPER. FOCUSING ON ON DEEP DECARBONIZATION CALIFORNIA THAT. AND I QUOTE. IN A SYSTEM WHERE MOST GENERATIONS INTERMITTENT. LOSS OF LOAD EVENTS DON'T NECESSARILY OCCURRED DURING HIGH LOAD CONDITIONS RATHER. THE BIGGEST DRIVER IS THE POTENTIAL FOR MULTI DAY PERIODS OF LOW RENEWABLE ENERGY PRODUCTION. DURING THESE EVENTS RENEWABLE GENERATION MAY BE INSUFFICIENT TO SERVE ALL LOAD AND STORAGE QUICKLY DEPLETES. SO THIS MULTI DAY RENEWABLE ENERGY WALL IS D. KEOGH ALL ARE THE KEY PROBLEM. THAT WE ARE TRYING TO SOLVE. AND WE'VE DONE OUR OWN ANALYSIS ON THIS ISSUE WE EXAMINED MEETING FOR MANAGING EXAMINED THIRTY FIVE YEARS OF RENEWABLE ENERGY DATA. THAT WAS PROVIDED BY THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION THROUGH THE INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLANNING PROCESS- AND WE LOOKED AT YOU KNOW WHAT DOES THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY MIX WORK LIKE IN TWENTY THIRTY. USING THIRTY FIVE YEARS OF DATA WE FOUND THAT. FIFTY OUR RENEWABLE ENERGY LEVELS OCCUR EVERY OTHER YEAR SO MANY EVERY OTHER YEAR ON AVERAGE YOU'RE EXPERIENCING A FIFTY OUR RENEWABLE ENERGY SHORTFALL. AND ONE HUNDRED OUR BALLS OCCUR ABOUT ONCE EVERY TEN YEARS. AT THE LONGEST WELL THAT WE FOUND IN THIS PERIOD WAS ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FORTY HOURS. ACTUALLY WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE RELIABILITY CHALLENGE THAT OF THE FUTURE AND THE CHALLENGE THAT WE'RE TRYING TO SOLVE. IT'S NOT REALLY A SEASONAL CHALLENGES ABOUT BEING ABLE TO RELIABLY PROVIDE POWER DURING THESE MULTI DAY PERIODS OF LOW RENEWABLE ENERGY PRODUCTION. I THINK THIS ANALYSIS IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSCORE THAT THIS IS NOT A TWENTY FIFTY PROBLEM. THIS IS A PROBLEM THAT WE FOUND IN LOOKING AT THE TWENTY THIRTY CALIFORNIA ENERGY NEXUS IS REALLY ONE PLANNING. CYCLE AWAY- SO THIS IS OF A PROBLEM THAT WE'RE GOING AFTER I AND UNFORTUNATELY IT IS NOT SO EASY TO JUST SAY THIS IS THE TECHNOLOGY THAT WE WANT TO COMMERCIALIZE AND THEREFORE ALL IS GOOD RIGHT THAT THAT'S THE REASON WHY WE'RE HERE TODAY- OF COURSE- COMMERCIALIZING AND NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY IS HARD. I'M THAT THE POWER SECTOR IS REALLY CHARACTERIZED BY. MARION CHANGED IN SOME CASES CENTURY OLD THAT INCUMBENTS. AND THE COST OF ELECTRICITY IS REALLY WHAT THE POWER SECTOR HAS BEEN MORE COST AND RELIABILITY REALLY HAVE BEEN THE THINGS OF THE POWER SECTOR HAS BEEN. I KIND OF LASER FOCUS ON OPTIMIZING FOR- FOR A HUNDRED YEARS AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT AS A RESULT OF THAT THE COST OF ELECTRICITY TODAY IS ABOUT ONE TWO HUNDRED. ABOUT WHAT OF WHAT IT WAS ABOUT A HUNDRED YEARS AGO. ASK THE INDUSTRY IS REALLY USED TO KIND OF. OPTIMIZING FOR SHORT RUN COSTS- ABSENT ANY KIND OF POLICY INTERVENTION IT DOESN'T USUALLY DISTINGUISH BETWEEN- THE ATTRIBUTES OF ELECTRICITY AND THERE THERE ISN'T REALLY A HISTORY OF PAYING A PREMIUM FOR GREEN TECHNOLOGIES ARE FOR INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES IS REALLY. LASER FOCUSED ON MINIMIZING SHORT RUN COSTS. AND THAT THE OTHER MAN THE OTHER PART THAT I MENTION IT'S REALLY LASER FOCUSED ON RELIABILITY. I YOU KNOW SENT ELECTRICITY IS VERY CENTRAL TO OUR MODERN LIVES- AND IN ORDER TO OPERATE THE GEAT RELIABLY ME AFTER THESE BALANCING SUPPLY AND DEMAND AT ALL IMES- AND BECAUSE OF THAT DYNAMIC WE HAVE BY TYPICALLY VERY RISK AVERSE- ENTITIES SO INTO. YOU KNOW BASICALLY COMPANIES THAT OUR SUPPLIER POWER DON'T WANT TO EXPERIMENT WITH THAT PROBLEM SO. THAT WE HAVE THESE KIND OF TWO PROBLEMS WE HAVE- OPTIMIZING FOR REALLY SHORT RUN COSTS ABOVE ALL ELSE AND OPTIMIZING FOR RELIABILITY ABOVE ALL ELSE- AND THIS IS A BIG CHALLENGE WHEN YOU HAVE NEW TECHNOLOGIES THAT OFTEN START OUT AS- MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THEIR INCUMBENTS. WITH OF COURSE A PATHWAY TO BEING MUCH CHEAPER BUT WHEN THE COMPANIES ARE JUST GETTING LAUNCHED- BECAUSE OF ALL THE REASONS THAT ALEX AND OTHERS HAVE MENTIONED. THEY MIGHT BE MORE EXPENSIVE. AND ARE PERCEIVED NEW RISKS RIGHT. AND IT'S THEIR PERCEIVED ARRESTS WITH EAST ECOLOGY'S. AND SO AGAINST THAT BACK COMPANIES LIKE FOR ME G. HAVE TO SCALE TO A POINT OF REALLY HAVING HUNDREDS OF MEGAWATTS OF CAPACITY ON THE GRID SO THEY CAN BOTH BRING COSTS DOWN- AND CONVINCE ALL OF THE FINANCIERS AND OTHER ENTITIES THAT THESE ARE REALLY LOW RISK TECHNOLOGIES- I'M IN IN ORDER TO DO THAT WE'RE GONNA BRING IT CAN YOU JUST SHUT UP AND WILL TRY AND GET TO THE OTHERS SPEAKERS. SO OKAY. AGUIAR-CURRY OKAY GO AHEAD YEAH SO WHAT LONG STORY SHORT TO GET THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS A HISTORY OF SUPPORTING AT TECHNOLOGIES AND INNOVATION- THIS IS DONE WITH WHAT THE MRI ON PROVIDING LONG TERM INVESTMENT SIGNALS THAT REALLY I KIND OF FOCUS ON THE DIFFERENT STAGES OF TECHNOLOGY COMMERCIALIZATION SUPPORTING DEMONSTRATION AT THE EARLIER STAGES OF TECHNOLOGY COMMERCIALIZATION. THAT HAS REALLY LED TO THE SIGNIFICANT BENEFITS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AYE THERE'S A REASON THAT WE ARE HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I AND THERE'S A REASON THAT THAT THE INDUSTRY IS VERY ROBUST THERE- THIS IS ALSO A PROBLEM THIS MONTH THAT A PROBLEM IS SOMETHING THAT IS THAT YOU THREE AND OTHERS I FOUND THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE AN ISSUE JUST IN CALIFORNIA BUT ALSO IN THE ACIFIC NORTHWEST IN THE MIDWEST NORTHEAST UP STATIC CALIFORNIA REALLY HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO LEAD HERE DEMONSTRATE A PATHWAY FOR SOLVING THIS PROBLEM AND ABOUT THE INDUSTRY- THAT CAN KIND OF GROW IN CALIFORNIA AND THEN BE EXPORTED TO- REALLY. PEOPLE ELSEWHERE OKAY SO ARE AT THE END OF THIS PANEL I'LL BE ASKING- WHAT POLICIES MIGHT HELP YOU ARE TO GET YOUR VENTURE CAPITAL FUNDING WHICH I SUSPECT YOU'RE GETTING- I'M ALSO JUST JUST FOR THE MOMENT. WHILE YOU'RE HERE. I SHOW YOUR- RUSHED BASED BATTERY- FIRST ALL FOR PEOPLE IN THE AUDIENCE THE REASON WHY WE WENT WITH LITHIUM AIR IS EXCUSE ME LET THE M. ION IS THAT IT IS LIGHTWEIGHT. THE THEMES ABOUT AS LIGHT AS YOU CAN GET FOR AN ELEMENT THAT'S A METAL- IT'S LIGHT WEIGHT AND IT'S SMALL AND FOR OUR PHONES IN OUR CARS THAT'S WHAT WE NEED. NOW IF YOU DON'T CHARGE A LITHIUM ION BATTERY FOR A WEEK. YOU DON'T HAVE MUCH TRACHSEL HAFT- SO IF YOU JUST JUST SITTING THERE IT'S JUST CHARGES DO YOU DOES YOUR IRON BATTERY DISCHARGE OVER THE PERIOD OVER PERIOD OF TIME. YEAH IT'S AN EXCELLENT QUESTION- THAT THE SHORT ANSWER IS YES WE DO EXPERIENCED SELF DISCHARGE. BUT THAT THE REALITY IS WE DON'T THAT OUR BATTERIES DON'T SIT THERE AND SAID I DON'T RATHER OUR BATTERIES ARE ACTUALLY VERY ACTIVE THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. SO WHEN WE LOOK AT KIND OF THE LEAST COST THE COST MINIMIZING MIX OF RESOURCES AND THE COST MINIMIZING WAIT IT TOOK TO OPERATE THESE ASSETS. WE ACTUALLY SEE THAT WHILE WE ARE PROVIDING SEASONAL STORAGE SO WE MIGHT BE HAVING KIND OF- CONSISTENT CHARGING OVER THE OVER SPRING OR- FALL ME HAVE ACCESS RENEWABLE ENERGY AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I AM KIND OF NET DISCHARGE THROUGHOUT THE SUMMER THROUGHOUT THE WINTER WE ACTUALLY SEE THAT- WE'RE REALLY KIND OF OPERATING ON A DAILY BASIS DOING SOME CHARGING SOME DISCHARGING ON A DAILY BASIS. I WE JUST HAPPEN TO BE CHARGING MORE ON AVERAGE IN THOSE DAYS DURING THE SPRING MORE ON AVERAGE IN THOSE DAYS DURING THAT THE FALL AND- YOU KNOW LAST ON AVERAGE IN THOSE DAYS IN THE WINTER- AND MUST MUST ON AVERAGE DURING THE IN THOSE DAYS IN THE SUMMER SO. I WE ACTUALLY DON'T SEE VERY MANY CARRIERS WERE JUST SITTING AROUND DOING NOTHING AND BECAUSE OF THAT THE SOUTH DISCHARGED CHALLENGE ISN'T REALLY KIND OF A COURT CHALLENGE THAT ECONOMIC YEAH BUT CAN YOU DO THAT AND STILL HAVE A HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE DAYS OF RESERVE. BECAUSE I CAN ASSURE YOU NO POLITICIAN WANTS TO GO EVEN ONE DAY. WITHOUT ELECTRICITY. SO CAN YOU DO ALL THAT AND STILL HAVE A HUNDRED FORTY FIVE DAYS IN A RESERVE. MOST OF WHICH. CHARGING OCCURRED MONTHS AGO. I'M CAN YOU MAYBE EXPLAIN WHAT A HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE DAYS NUMBERS CAN. AB AS THE AMOUNT OF TIME WHEN YOU FOUND THAT THERE WAS. NOT ENOUGH SOLAR AND WIND THAT'S A HUNDRED AND FORTY HOURS. FORTY HOURS YES HUNDRED FORTY HOURS SO ALL RIGHT SO HUNDREDS OF **** THAT MAKES MORE SENSE I'M SORRY A HUNDRED AND FORTY HOURS NOT DAYS I SHOULD HAVE CAUGHT MYSELF THERE'S SO HUNDRED ORDER. YES ONE OF IN ONLY THE THING THAT THAT DRIVES HOW MUCH ENERGY WE CAN START OUR BATTERY IS THE THICKNESS OF OUR ELECTORATE OF THE IRON ELECTRODES. SO IF WE YOU KNOW BASICALLY A HUNDRED HOURS IS THAT ESSENTIALLY ONE LAYER THICK. AND IF WE WANT TO MAKE IT TO OUR OUR TWO HUNDRED HOUR BATTERY WE ESSENTIALLY DOUBLE THE THICKNESS OF THE ELECTRODE. AND SO ESSENTIALLY PRODUCING LONGER DURATION BATTERIES TO COVER THESE LONGER DURATION EVENTS IS KIND OF A% PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT CYCLE NOT A FUNDAMENTAL- TECHNICAL CHALLENGE SO YOU KNOW WHILE OUR FIRST PRODUCT IS A HUNDRED HOUR BATTERY BECAUSE WE THINK THAT'S WHERE THE MARKET WILL BE IN TWENTY. TWENTY FIVE TO TWENTY THIRTY. FIVE THERE'S NO KIND O FUNDAMENTAL CHALLENGE THAT PREVENTS US FROM. COMMERCIALIZING EIGHT AT TWO HUNDRED HOUR BATTERY OR A HUNDRED AND FIFTY HOUR BATTERY AND IN FACT WE ACTUALLY HAVE. YOU KNOW HUNDRED FIFTY AND TWO HUNDRED OUR BATTERIES ON TEST AT OUR FACILITIES IN CALIFORNIA AND- AND MESSAGES AND OVER THE COURSE OF MARKET SHARE A MONTH. HOW MUCH SELF DISCHARGE WOULD THERE BE. IF YOU WEREN'T. CONSTANTLY I KNOW YOU'RE SAYING YOU'RE PUTTING ENERGY IN AND ENERGY OUT ON A DAILY BASIS. BUT IF YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A HUNDRED OUR STORAGE FOR SOME TIME IN THE WINTER- YOU CAN GET OUR- YOU'RE GONNA HAVE LET'S SAY. PUT SOME ENERGY AND A LARGE AMOUNT LET'S SAY IN THE IN THE FALL- AND YOU MAY BE TAKING YOU TO HOUSE A FEW MEGAWATT HOURS IN AND OUT BUT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE THE HUGE RESERVE AND THE QUESTION IS CAN YOU HAVE IT THERE THE HUGE RESERVE FOR THE WINTER HUNDRED HOURS WORTH FOUR. MONTHS YES ABSOLUTELY AND WHAT WE'RE DOING RIGHT NOW TO DEMONSTRATE THAT WE ARE WE'RE ACTUALLY WORKING ON A PROJECT FUNDED BY THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION. I IN COLLABORATION WITH THE E. THREE TO KIND OF DEMONSTRATE HOW LONG DURATION STORAGE- CAN OPERATE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. OUR BASICALLY MODELING IN VERY MUCH DETAIL THAT THE CALIFORNIA GRAD AND LOOKING AT THESE TYPES OF PROBLEMS I WAS ACTUALLY AT A PROJECT THAT- THAT PROFESSOR COURAGE IS ALSO FUNDED UNDER SOMEWHERE WHERE CONNECT. I ONE OF THE OTHER TEAMS THAT THAT IS WORKING ON THE SAME THE SAME CHALLENGE SO. TRANCERS YES AND WE'RE LOOKING AT THAT AND HAVE KIND OF A LOT OF DETAILED MODELING. SHARE ZERO EIGHT AND A DEBT YEAH THE OTHER THING TO SAY ABOUT THIS IS COMPARED TO LITHIUM ION OF COURSE IT'S GOING TO BE A LOT HEAVIER AND A LOT BIGGER AND THAT'S FINE. YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT TRYING TO MAKE PHONES OR OR CARDS- WE'RE DOING UTILITY SCALE AND- IT'LL STILL. IT'S AN AMAZING TECHNOLOGY ALL RIGHT OUR FINAL SPEAKER OKAY. IS SOMEONE THAT I'M I'M VERY PLEASED TO JOIN ME IN THIS DOCTOR REVY- SURE FROM LAWRENCE BERKELEY NATIONAL LAB AND HE'S GOING TO TALK TO US ABOUT HOW TO RAPIDLY SCALE INNOVATIVE ENERGY STORAGE TECHNOLOGIES. AGAIN VERY DISTINGUISHED- AND A GRADUATE OF THE INDIAN INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY IN DELHI WHICH IS AN EXTRAORDINARY INSTITUTION ARE TRULY ARRIVAL WITH MIT OR CALTECH. AND A PHD FROM ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY- TWENTY YEARS OF EXPERIENCE WORKING IN OUR INDIAN LARGE INDUSTRY START UP GOVERNMENT ACADEMICS. AT CETERA SO- DR BASHAR- PLEASE BEGIN YOUR PRESENTATION. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HAD CALLED I SHARE I HAD MY SHARE MARTIN IS NOT. ACTIVE SO I'M NOT SURE HOW I CAN SHARE MY PRESENTATION. CAN YOU HEAR ME. OKAY. ALL RIGHT CAN YOU HEAR ME WE CAN HEAR YOU SCREAM IS- IS COMING UP WE SEE YEAR- WHAT WE SHE IS ON THE LEFT THE LIST OF THE SLIDE YOU AND THERE WE GO PERFECT. NOW YOU'RE THERE. ONCE I'M SORRY MY DAUGHTER THE START OF PARAMOUNT I HAD WAS JUST GIVE ME A SECOND OKAY. HEY WE ALL WORK AT HOME THESE GET NOTHING. WHILE WE'RE WAITING FOR ALL THE SLIDES BE AVAILABLE FOR OUR YES WE'RE PLANNING TO ASK YOU TO THE OFFICE FOR THE SLIDES AND WILL DISTRIBUTE THEM TO ANYONE WHO'S BEEN THERE ARE MEMBERS OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE AS WELL AS THE GREAT CHAIRS AND VICE CHAIRS OF- UTILITIES AND- ALSO LAW NATURAL RESOURCES AND- ANYONE ELSE SINCE YOU STOPPED BY THANK. YES THIS IT WAS HARD TO- TAKE ALL THOSE SLIDES IN. ALL RIGHT UP SORRY WE'RE NOT YOU KNOW THAT'S THE ONE OF THE THINGS OF WORKING FROM HOME. YUP YOUR OF FIRST ORDER GOT FIRED TODAY THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME VIDEOLAN COMMITTEE ON ART SHARE MY TALKS ABOUT LONG DURATION ENERGY STORAGE. SO UNDER PRESSURE I AND THIS IS A LOT BETTER. THE TECHNOLOGY AREA AB LAWS BUT LOST A LOT. RAMOS AN EXAMPLE FACILITIES YOU BERKELEY WHAT I TEACH COURSES IN MECHANICAL ENGINEERING. GET TO THE SLIDE HERE AND I'D BE HAVE HARD FOR MANY OF US SPEAKERS WHY LACK LONGER ISN'T STORED IS VERY IMPORTANT. A FEW OF OUR SCIENTISTS IN THE LAB THEY ANALYZED. RADIUS AND ARTICLES OF UNIVALENT OG. ARE YOU KNOW ASSUMING THAT YOU KNOW HAVE IN THE FUTURE. WHAT FRACTION OF THE ENERGY STORAGE CAN BE LONG DURATION STORAGE AND- THE BABY ANIMALS IF I LONG RESISTED IS A GREAT ANYTHING THAT AT THE TIME. TEN HOURS TO DAY. WHAT EVERYBODY'S. WHAT DO YOU FIND OUT OF THIS ROBERT YOU SEE IS ROUGHLY- PART OF THIS I'M SORRY THIS LIABILITY DEADLINE IS SHIFTED THE PRESENTATION BUT- A TO POWER OFF. WELL NOT JUST YOURS MEMBERS RIGHT HERE. I DON'T HAVE HOURS TO UPDATE TO TALK ABOUT THE OVERALL ENERGY STORAGE REQUIREMENT. IT'S GOING TO MORE THAN TEN HOURS GOOD. THAT'S A BIG NUMBER. ANOTHER DOPE FOR MANY OF US SPEAKERS AND FROM BURGER CORD THAT GIVE THEM UNDESERVEDLY GOOD TECHNOLOGY FOR SHORT DURATION I WOULD SAY BETWEEN FOUR TO SIX HOURS GOOD. REALLY NOT A VERY GOOD BECAUSE OF A TECHNOLOGY FOR ANYTHING BEYOND THE NUMBERS FOR SURE. EVEN ASSUMING VERY CAUGHT AGGRESSIVE COST ARGUES WITH HIM. AND THE LEADING LONGER TECHNO LOGY SUCH A PUMPED HYDRO COMPRESSED AIR STORAGE. I'M SORRY REALLY NEED. THAT'S WHY THERE IS. TO DOUBLE UP A STATE COST EFFECTIVE. JOGADOR FICA THE INDEPENDENT LONG RESISTANCE TO. RIGHT AND THAT'S RIGHT YOU KNOW MRS YEP HAVING THIS CONVERSATION IF IT'S- BUT HERE IS ANOTHER. AT THE SHOW WITH INFORMATION. I WAS DISTRACTED. BOB FROM THE DATABASE PUBLICATIONS ARE NOT A BUSINESS ON THE STORAGE. THE BIG CHART BIG SORT OF SHOWS YOU WERE BROUGHT WHAT ABOUT WHAT ABOUT THREE. FOR MORE THAN THREE THOUSAND RECORDS STRAW IN THIS PARTICULAR DATABASE. ORDER THAT TO CAME OUT ABOUT THE SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF THESE BATTERIES ARE BASED ON THE TIME ABOUT TWO WEEKS. AND SOME OF THEM ARE VERY BASIC FLOW BATTERIES. REPORTER WORKING LONG DURATION ENERGY STORAGE. THE SERVER DINOSAUR. SO THAT SHOWS YOU THAT THERE IS SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITY TO GROW THE LONGER SENTENCES TO THE SPACE WHAT PROBABLY SHOWS DEVELOPMENT. DEMONSTRATION AND DEPLOYMENT OKAY IN CONSERVING THE PREVIOUS SLIDE WHERE A SHORTAGE MORE THAN TWO THIRDS OF THOSE ISSUES REQUIRED WOULD BE LOG DURATION THERE ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE BEST MORE. OF OUR RESOURCES IN DEVELOPING COST EFFECTIVE LONGER SENTENCES STORAGE. SO ARE YOU SURE SURE SOME TALKS WITH YOU. BASED ON SOME OF MY OWN EXPERIENCES BOTH WORKING AND PRIVATE SECTOR. I'M SORRY AS A PROGRAM MANAGER IN. OUR ADVANCED RESEARCH PROJECTS AGENCY ENERGY IN. UP IN DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY AND THAT SHORT FORMS ARE PRETTY. WHICH IS AN AGENCY FARMS HIGH DECIDED WHAT PRODUCTS ARE BRENT THERE ARE A- AFTER WORKING AFTER HAVING WHAT ELEVEN YEARS INTEL THE SEMICONDUCTOR COMPANY EVENT CORPORATE IS A PROGRAM DIRECTOR. NUMBER TO START UP AND THEN I'LL GET A LOT. BUT WHAT ARE SOME OF THE THAT I'VE SEEN. WHICH I THINK I MIGHT. PRINCIPAL PHOTOGRAPHY IS GETTING INTO WHICH. FIRST OF ALL WE EVER LOOKED AT MANY DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGIES READ THE ORIGINAL PROCESS IS THE SEMICONDUCTOR CHIP I WOULD TECHNOLOGY OR- BECOME A BATTERY OR ANY OTHER KIND OF STORAGE IF FROM THE TIME YOU DISCOVERED OR INVENTED NEW IDEA. THE TIME IT IS SOLVE ALL MANUFACTURING'S ISSUES YOU HAVE A SCALABLE TECHNOLOGY EVERYBODY TO DEPLOY. IT ROUGHLY TAKES FIFTEEN TO TWENTY YEARS. UNFORTUNATELY DON'T HAVE THAT MUCH OF TIME BECAUSE OF THE- REPORTER SO THE CLIMATE CHANGE. IT WITHIN TEN TO FIFTEEN YES SO WE JUST DON'T HAVE SO WE NEED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT I'M SHIFT DRAMATICALLY SCALING. NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND NEW IDEAS RIGHT PARTICULARLY FOR LOW ENERGY AND ON TOP OF THAT ENERGY IS ALSO CALLED CONTRIBUTED BY THE FACT THAT POLICY. AND INDIVIDUALS A PRESERVATIVE IT'D BE BROKE. RIGHT SO I BELIEVE THAT WE NEED TO DEVELOP REALLY GOOD PRIVATE PUBLIC. PARTNERSHIP A FRAMEWORK WHERE YOU CAN DRAMATICALLY ACCELERATE. DISCOVERED A MONSTER PLANET- TIME FRAME. AND SOME OF THE OTHER. THAT WAS A PARTICULARLY AS AS A GOVERNMENT FUNDING AGENCY WHICH IS FUNDING FOR THE STATE OR FEDERAL. A REALLY GOOD IDEAS. ABOUT PERSONAL TECHNOLOGY NEEDS WELL AS YOU SHOULD DEFINE OBJECTIVES NOT JUSTICE FOR THE VICTIMS. LET THEY KNOW WE'RE JUST IT OUT. AND THEM. YES SOME OF THOSE IDEAS MAYES HAS BEEN ARGUABLY THE BETTER ONES. HOWEVER IN THE WATER NOT ONLY THE BALL PARTY. ONLY THIS IS A LOT OF. SO TO THE RESIDENCE. SIMILARLY IT WAS- POLICY SHOULD BE ACKNOWLEDGED INDIVIDUAL BUT THE SHOULD PRODUCE VIDEO TACTIC NOT ONLY GONZALEZ IS ON THE IDEA THAT THE FUNDING. SEE WHAT MAKES SENSE. RIGHT TO GET YOU IN AS SOON AS I CAN WATER MORE INFORMATION YOU WANTED DEPLOYMENT OF DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS YEAH MORE INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO MAKE THE COLLEGES MEANT CALL. A COUPLE EXAMPLE FROM MY OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCE BECAUSE I WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE I WAS FUNDING. OF IDEAS. WHEN I WAS IN OURBODY I FUNDED IT HI MY ONE OF MY PROGRAMS WAS ON. DEVELOPING A LOW GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL- RESURGENCE RIGHT SUFFERED A BUNCH OF PRODUCTS. ALL THE PRODUCTS WHICH ARE FUNDED FOR DEVELOPING GREEN SOLUTION FOR BUILDINGS. IN THE COURSE OF THE PROJECT I FOUND OUT. TO RIDICULOUS TECHNOGYM ECONOMIC ANALYSIS BECAUSE OF THE THAT WE STARTED GETTING FROM THE PROJECT. THAT THAT PARTICULAR TECHNOLOGY MADE MORE SENSE FOR THE REFRIGERATOR THAT DOESN'T HAVE CONDITION. AT ASSEMBLY MEMBER JIM THE DECISION I SAID OKAY LET'S JUST FOCUS DON'T TRY TO FOCUS ON A PRODUCT AND DINNER CONDITIONER MAKE IT. WITH A REFRIGERATOR. BUT I COULD MAKE THE DECISION BECAUSE YOU'RE DOING THE IDENTICAL ARE GONNA. AT THE SAME TIME I'VE BEEN BACK OKAY MANAGEMENT AND THE FLEXIBLE ENOUGH THE- I CAN REMEMBER THEY SAID THE GROUP. ALL RIGHT YOUR IN THE DIRECTION OF THE PROJECT. I'M NOT REALLY THAT DOES SOMETHING THAT EVERYBODY. I WOULD SAY A COUPLE- I DID A REALLY GOOD PRODUCT AND A SUCCESSFUL PROJECT. LAST NIGHT I JUST WANT TO SHARE SOMETHING ABOUT WHAT WE HAVE BEEN DOING ANY OF THIS KIND OF VISION THAT I SHARED EVEN THOUGH THE SLIGHT. IN OUR OWN LAB SO IN THE LAB YOU HELP PEOPLE I MEAN WE ARE MANY PEOPLE WORKING DIFFERENT ENERGY STORAGE ALL OF IT FROM HYDROGEN TO MEET THEM I AM TO BECOME SELF ARE. COMING IN AS A STORAGE. ASSEMBLY ALSO PEOPLE WORKING WITH THE BALL THE- POLICYMAKERS AND- DALLAS OR ANOTHER ENTITY IS LOOKING A DEPLOYMENT LOOKING AT POLICY IMPACTS LOOKING AT. HOW TO MONETIZE STORAGE. SO REALLY LIKE TO BE NEED TO HARPER ONE ORGANIZATION BUT ALL OF THESE PEOPLE CAN WORK TOGETHER TO SHARE INFORMATION ON DOCTORS OPPORTUNITY LEAD TO. HELP ADVANCEMENT AS I MENTIONED EARLIER IT HOPE TO SHRINK THE TIMELINE FROM DISCOVERY'S LESS INVENTION TO DEPLOYMENT. DO YOU WANT TO THE DEPLOYMENT PEOPLE ANALYSIS PEOPLE THE TECHNOLOGY PEOPLE THE MATERIAL SCIENTISTS EVERYBODY TO COME UNDER ONE ENTITY SO THEY STARTED BUT YOU NEVER KNOW THE SOURCE CENTER. DR NOR BOCCE AND SHE RECENTLY JOINED A LONG SIX MONTHS AGO AS THE. UP THERE IN ORDER DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER. AND HERE WE ARE LOOKING AT. AN OLD BRITISH KIND OF THE- REGISTERED AS WELL IT DOES NOT AND I AND ALSO WORKING WITH THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND THE PUBLIC. FUNDING AGENCIES FINANCES AND I AM NOT BE ABLE TO HAVE A BEAT ABOUT THE SUMMIT. REGIS ARE JOINTLY ORGANIZED BY TWO NATIONAL LABS HERE IN THE BAY AREA AND BE INVITED. A LOT ABOUT YOU KNOW THEY JUST STE IN THAT AREA- IN THE SUMMIT AND THEY HAVE TO SHARE A LOT OF. IT TOO WAS NOTHING IN THIS FIELD OF WHAT ELSE IS NEEDED. WE WOULD LIKE TO ENCOURAGE UNDERAGE SUMMIT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU A DOCTOR SO JUST TO SUMMARIZE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS. WHAT ABOUT REGISTERED FROM THE LAST SPEAKER- DR BURGER THAT WE'RE GONNA NEED SOME SORT OF MASSIVE STORAGE TECHNOLOGY AND- I'M LOOKING BOTH. JUST TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA HOW BIG THIS IS FOR THOSE WHO ARE IN THE AUDIENCE. THEY TALK. OUR FIRST SPEAKER TALKED ABOUT- HAVING FIFTEEN HUNDRED MEGAWATTS BROUGHT ONLINE- AND THAT'S THREE HOURS WORTH SO THAT'S FORTY FIVE HUNDRED MEGAWATT HOURS. THE KIND OF ESTIMATES WE'VE GOTTEN FROM OUR LAST TWO SPEAKERS IS WE'RE GONNA NEED NOT FORTY FIVE HUNDRED. BUT TWO TO THREE AND A HALF MILLION MEGAWATT HOURS OF STORAGE IN THE FUTURE. SO GOING FROM FORTY FIVE HUNDRED TO TWO TO THREE AND A HALF MILLION. CHEN IT'S- IT'S SORT OF UNBELIEVABLE THAT WE CAN DO IT AND AGAIN OUR LAST SPEAKER IS SAYING WE HAVE TO DO IT BY TWENTY THIRTY NOW- ONE THING THAT YOU CAN DO WITH THE NATIONAL LAB IS BRING EVERYONE TOGETHER WE DID THAT AT LAWRENCE LAB WHEN I WAS THERE FOR. AT ESSENTIALLY TAKING TECHNOLOGIES WE HAVE DEVELOPED AND- SETTING UP- INCUBATORS AND- THAT TRYING TO GET THAT TECHNOLOGY OUT. AND MY QUESTION FOR ALL THREE. OF THE FOLKS HERE. IS- WHAT DO WE NEED TO DO. TO ENCOURAGE THE INSTEAD OF TAKING TWENTY FOUR YEARS OR WHATEVER TO DEVELOP WE HAVE TO DEVELOP IT IN TWO OR THREE YEARS IN THE DEPLOYED ANOTHER FIVE HOW THE HECK CAN WE DO THAT AND WHAT CAN WE DO FROM A POLICY POINT OF VIEW. A TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE. SO ALEX PERHAPS YOU COULD GO FIRST. HI DOCTOR KIRK THANK YOU YEAH YEAH I THINK. SORRY IS IT OKAY IF I CHAMPION YEAH YEAH ABSOLUTELY I WANTED YOU TO JUMPED AND ALEX OKAY YEAH WELL AGAIN I THINK WE'RE LOOKING AT A VERY LARGE PROBLEM AND I THINK FOR YOU ALL IN THIS ROLE AN IMPORTANT ROLE OF GOVERNMENT. IN AND HELPING NAVIGATOR SET DIRECTIONS FOR CALIFORNIA ON THESE ISSUES THERE ARE A NUMBER OF THINGS WE CAN DO AND LOOK AT. SOME OF WHICH WERE ALREADY DOING WE'RE ALREADY DOING I THINK A PRETTY GOOD JOB OF INCUBATING EARLY STAGE TECHNOLOGIES BUT THE METAPHOR I USE IS IF YOU GO BACK TO NINETEEN HUNDRED AND YOU SAID HEY. PRETTY SOON WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO GET ACROSS THE ATLANTIC OCEAN WE WANT TO MOVE REALLY QUICKLY- TELL ME WHICH BOWED I SHOULD RESERVE AND AT SOME POINT SOMEONE SAID WELL DON'T RESERVE A BOAT BECAUSE THERE'S THIS WHOLE NEW TECHNOLOGY OF AIRPLANE AND I CAN GET YOU OVER THERE FASTER. AND SO THESE THESE NEW TECHNOLOGIES IF WE INCUBATE M. AND WE SET UP. THE MATURATION OF THESE TECHNOLOGIES FOR RIGHT WHEN THE MARKET NEEDS THAT YOU CAN REALLY SOLVE A LOT OF PAIN AND REALLY HELP. AND I'D SAY GIVEN THE URGENCY. OF CLIMATE CHANGE WE KNOW. THE CLOCK IS TICKING AND WE KNOW WE NEED THIS SUITE OF TECHNOLOGIES THERE I THINK STUDY AFTER STUDY SHOWING THAT. AND SO REALLY THE QUESTION IS HOW DO WE READY THAT TOOL KIT AND WHAT CAN WE DO. AND SPECIFICALLY THERE'S- PROGRAMS CAN HELP. FUNDING CAN HELP FOR INSTANCE THE BUDGET IS LOOKING AT FOUR HUNDRED BILLION FOR CVC PROGRAMS FOR LONG DURATION. AND YEAH THAT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT THING AND IN IN MY INDUSTRY. CALIFORNIA'S EFFORTS THERE HAVE PROMPTED I WOULD SAY THOUSANDS OF HOURS OF CONVERSATION. IN RENEWED INTEREST IN CALIFORNIA PLANTS MANUFACTURING EXPLORATION SO ALL OF THIS STUFF HAPPENS. WHEN YOU GUYS TALK ABOUT IT. AND THE WORLD IS PAYING ATTENTION I THINK WE ALSO NEED POLICY DIRECTIONS ON ADDING DIVERSITY TO THE FLEET IN THE RIGHT WAYS. AND WE NEED POLICY EFFORTS TO DIVERSIFY THE FLEET MAYBE AND DIRECTED WAYS- WE HAVE A REALLY LARGE INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS THAT SHOULD BE PART OF THE- TOOL KIT. BUT THEY NEED. HELP COVERING THAT GREEN PREMIUM AND ONE OF THE WAYS TO DO THAT IS WHAT WE CALL BY DOWN FUNDS WHERE- FUNDING IS AVAILABLE TO OFFSET THAT GREEN PREMIUM JUST SO WE HAVE THAT EXTRA TOOL IN THE TOOL KIT AT THE RIGHT TIME. AND SO WE'RE SUPPORT ABOUT ALL OF THAT- AND I CAN COME UP WITH MORE SOME MORE SPECIFIC- RECOMMENDATIONS ON HOW TO MOVE FORWARD BUT I WANTED TO JUST START WITH THAT LIST- THAT'S EXCELLENT WHAT WE'VE DONE IN THE PAST TO BUY DOWN THE PRICE. IS TO TELL PG&amp;E AND EDISON AND OTHER LARGE UTILITIES- PURCHASE GREEN ENERGY. NOW THE BUY DOWN COST WHERE WERE WE WERE PAYING FOR SOLAR FARM MORE THAN TEN WE WOULD FOR NATURAL GAS PLANT AND NOT GETTING THE FLEXIBILITY OF% NATURAL GAS PLANT THAT COST WAS DEAD BY THE RATE PAYERS. THAT'S PART OF THE REASON WHY WE NOW HAVE SUCH HIGH ENERGY PRICES AND A MATTER OF FACT THE- THE CCC ARE. OUR COMMUNITY- ENERGY COMPANIES WE'VE GOT NOW REALLY COMPLAIN MORE WE HAVE TO HAVE ALL OF THESE OLD COSTS WHY CAN'T WE JUST HAVE THE NEW SOLAR PANEL. BECAUSE WE ALL INVESTED IN THE OLD SOLAR AND WE ALL GOT TO CONTINUE TO PAY FOR IT BUT- AT SOME POINT THAT BECOMES VERY DIFFICULT TO SAY THE RATE PAYERS ARE GOING TO PAY FOR IT ALSO THAT'S JUST ONE QUESTION THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE- CAN WE HAVE- DO WE HAVE SINCE. YEAH IT SUCKS BONTA. I'M SORRY MR FOR RESPOND REALLY QUICKLY-YEAH MISTER MARCUS IS ALEX GET AROUND ALSO WE HAVE SOME UNIQUE FEDERAL FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES IF WE POSITION OURSELVES TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT MONEY AND THAT'S A VERY LIVE DEBATE I KNOW THE CECE'S WELL POSITION ON THAT. IN HIS INDUSTRY AND DOES- CALIFORNIA'S POLICY LEADERSHIP AND LEGISLATURE WE CAN ALL GEAR UP AND STRATEGIZE TO DO THAT- INTO IT REALLY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF FEDERAL SUPPORT SO THAT IT DOESN'T FALL AS MUCH ON CALIFORNIA RATEPAYERS. THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT AND I THINK PEOPLE SOMETIMES SAY WE ARE ONLY RESPONSIBLE IN CALIFORNIA. WHAT ARE WHAT WE HEARD TODAY. IS YEAH WE'RE RESPONSIBLE 41% WE GOTTA DO OUR FAIR SHARE GETTING THAT DOWN BUT- WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING IS YOU'RE DEVELOPING THE TECHNOLOGIES FOR THE WHOLE COUNTRY. AND THAT'S IN FACT THE PLAN THAT WE DEVELOP THOSE TECHNOLOGIES THAT WE SHOW BY EXAMPLE. THAT'S ALSO THE REASON WHY WE CAN'T AFFORD TO HAVE ANY BROWNOUTS OR BLACKOUTS. MEMBER BENNETT I BELIEVE YOU HAVE SOME QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AM I ON YES YOU NEED TO PRESS. HELLO THERE NOW ON MY OWN YES GOOD GOOD THANK YOU OF UP THREE QUICK HINGS NUMBER ONE YOUR NUMBER OF TWO MILLION TO THREE MILLION STORAGE- I JUST WOULD LIKE TO UNDERSTAND MORE HOW YOU GOT TO THAT WELLNESS. AT WE CHEN A HUNDRED HOURS OF STORAGE THIS WAS FROM- DOCTOR BERGER FROM FOR MANAGING A SAID WE NEED A HUNDRED HOURS. AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A HUNDRED HOURS FOR ROUGHLY TWENTY THOUSAND MEGAWATTS. AND IF YOU MULTIPLY A HUNDRED TIMES TWENTY THOUSAND YOU GET TWO MILLION SO TWO MILLION MEGAWATT HOURS. COMPARED TO WHAT WE DID LAST YEAR WHICH IS FORTY FIVE HUNDRED MAKE A LOT HOURS SO THANK YOU. JUST YOU GO FROM FOUR THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED TWO TWO MILLION OR THREE MILLION OR THREE MILLION AND A HALF IT. WILL RAISE WE'RE WE'RE DOING SOME ARM WAVING HERE IS SUPPOSED TO HAND WAVING BUT THE NUMBERS ARE JUST YOU AND- LLOYD IS JUST GONNA TAKE A LONG TIME IF IT TAKES LONGER THAN WE HAVE SO WE'D BETTER. START NOW. MUST BE DEBT BY OTHER TWO QUESTIONS- AND ALEX APPRECIATE DID YOU GIVING US YOUR INSIGHT IS JUST. JUST A GENERAL INSIGHT ON ON TWO THINGS AND THAT IS. ON BY DOWN PROGRAMS FOR THE GREEN PREMIUM. IS IT BETTER FOR. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO. COMPLETELY FUND- A PARTICULAR INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAM- THE- INSTALLATION OF ELECTRIC CHARGING STATIONS FOR EXAMPLE OR IS IT BETTER FOR- THE STATE CALIFORNIA TO PROVIDE AND INSTEAD OF SAYING IF YOU PUT IN ELECTRIC CHARGING STATION WILL WILL PROVIDE. 30% OF THE COST OR 40% OF THE COST. TO TRY TO BUY DOWN THE GREEN PREMIUM FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE WHICH ONE IS GOING TO GET US THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE NEED. THE FASTEST THE BEST OF THE BEST INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE NEED IT THE QUICKEST CENTER. YEAH GOOD QUESTION MISTER BENNETT ASSEMBLY MEMBER THANK YOU FOR THE CHANCE TO SPEAK YEAH I HAVE A VERY. WIDE MEMBERSHIP AND MANY OF THEM HAVE STRONG OPINIONS ON THE BEST WAY FOR THEM TO HELP- AND I DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT ANSWER FOR YOU IN TERMS OF ITS THIS WAY OR THAT WAY BUT I DO WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT. THESE ARE ALL COMPANIES WILLING TO PUT OUT. YOU KNOW HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS- THEY'RE INVESTING A LOT OF MONEY AND- YOU KNOW I THINK THAT THE REALITY IS. THEY DO THAT AS PART OF THE BUSINESS SO THEY NEED TO HAVE SOME VISIBILITY TO. WHAT THE RETURNS AND RISK CAR AND THAT'S ONE THING WE CAN REALLY CONTROL SO IF WE DO TAKE THE PATH OF AN INCENTIVE PROGRAM. I THINK IT'S EASY FOR THEM TO SEE- THAT RETURN PEACE AND THAT REDUCES UNCERTAINTY ALTERNATIVELY IF THE STATE WANTS TO ENTER LONG TERM CONTRACTS THAT'S ANOTHER WAY OF REDUCING RISK ON. ON THESE COMPANIES AND HELPING THEM GET CHEAPER FINANCING TO MAKE THE PROJECT PENCIL OUT. AND OTHER THAN THAT MAYBE YOU KNOW FORM WOULD HAVE A PARTICULAR OPINION OF WHAT WORKS BEST BECAUSE I WHAT I SEE IS. A LOT OF COMPANIES HAVE DIFFERENT RISK APPETITES. AND DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO IT AND AGAIN MY- MY SENSE OF IT- AS A GREAT EXPERT AND NOT JUST AS THE- EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF C. SAYS THAT. THE NEEDS ARE HUGE JUST CHECK CANTIK AND SO I'M I'M INTERESTED IN A BIT OF A SHOCK IN APPROACH FRANKLY. BECAUSE WE REALLY ARE FACING A LEVEL OF STORAGE DEPLOYMENTS THAT'S NEVER BEEN ACHIEVED EVER. YOU KNOW THOUSANDS OF MEGAWATTS MEGAWATTS PER YEAR IT'S NEVER BEEN DONE. AND SO OPERATE JUST ABOUT THE EXECUTION PIECE FRANKLY. AMONGST MY SECOND QUESTION- IF I COULD NOT SPEAK. ENGLISH PLEASE- AND THAT IS THAT. YOU KNOW OF DR KIRCH SHOWED US. YEAH AND I KNOW IF YOU WERE ABLE TO BE ON DURING THAT PART OF THE PRESENTATION BUT SHOWED US- THERE IS THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT VALUE IN AND HAVING SOLAR. HAVING SOLAR CAPACITY- OR A COMBINATION OF SOLAR AND WIND CAPACITY TO TAKE CARE OF A THEN THAT WOULD BE FAR MORE THAN WE NEED IN THE SUMMERTIME BUT THEN WE COULD USE THAT SUMMER TIME- SOLAR AND WIND CAPACITY TO GENERATE LOW COST- HYDROGEN. AND THE OTHER TECH ALLERGIES THAT- SHE DESCRIBED THAT WE COULD USE WITH THAT. SO TO WHAT EXTENT DO YOU THINK FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE- IT WOULD MAKE SENSE FOR US TO GO AHEAD AND JUST. KEEP PUSHING ON THE SOLAR SIDE SO THAT WE LOWER THE COST OF THE SOLAR. ELECTRICITY WE HAVE PLENTY OF IT AND WE HAVE. A LITTLE FOR LACK OF A BETTER WORD QUOTE INEXPENSIVE ELECTRICITY THAT IS AVAILABLE. FOR THE STORAGE OPTIONS THAT ARE OUT THERE WHETHER IT'S HYDROGEN OF THE OTHER OPTIONS. COULD CAN YOU GIVE ME YOUR SORT OF INITIAL REACTION TO THAT- THOUGHT. ABSOLUTELY YEAH GREAT QUESTION IN MY SENSE OF IT IS- THAT. WE NEED A BETTER BALANCE BETWEEN THE SOLAR GENERATION AND STORAGE COMING ONLINE AND AS WE PUSH THE STORAGE FURTHER WE PUSH THE SOLAR FURTHER YOU NEED LONGER DURATION STORAGE. SO YOU REALLY WANT TO BE INCREMENTING FORWARD ON BOTH FRONTS AND- YEAH AS AS GAVE MENTIONED WE SEE RIGHT NOW HOW IF WE PUSH TOO HARD ON THE SOLAR. IT THEN IT'S HARD FOR THE GREAT TO OPERATE WITHOUT ENOUGH STORAGE EVEN NOW EVEN THIS SUMMER AND LAST SUMMER AND SO. I THINK AS WE PUSH LIKE YOU SUGGEST WE SHOULD ON THE SMALLER SIDE BUT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THE STORAGE IS KEEPING UP. AND THAT IT'S ADDING TO ITS DURATION ACROSS TIME SO THAT IT CAN HELP SOLVE THESE PROBLEMS I GUESS AND THERE'S ONE OTHER QUICK NOTE REALLY SORRY TO INTERRUPT YOU SIR- BUT I YOU KNOW THERE'S SO MANY THINGS WE CAN DO WITH EXTRASOLAR IT'S A GREAT PROBLEM. AND ON ONE HAND- WE KNOW THAT CURTAILING SOLDIERS REALLY INEXPENSIVE QUICK SOLUTION. BUT THERE'S ALSO WAYS WE CAN USE SOLAR ENERGY WE CAN CREATE HEAT THAT THEN IS USED FOR DRYING PRUNES AND WHICH IS PART OF CALIFORNIA'S NEEDS RIGHT SO YOU THERE YOU CAN DRIVE ALL THESE INDUSTRIES. JUST WITH A LOT OF EXTRA CHEAP POWER IN CALIFORNIA I GUESS THAT'S WHAT I WANTED TO GET TO AND THAT IS THAT. IT IT CERTAINLY THERE NEED TO BE A BALANCE BUT YOU COULD HAVE EXCESS SOLAR AND IT'S NOT TOO EXPENSIVE TO TURN IT OFF. IF YOU INCENTIVISED IT PROPERLY IN TERMS OF IDENTIFYING HEY THIS IS. NOT STROLLER THIS GONNA NECESSARILYBE PURCHASED BY THE POWER COMPANIES RIGHT NOW EXCEPT FOR- BUT- WHAT YOU'RE PUTTING IN A PROJECT TO. EITHER SCALE THAT PROJECT LARGER THAN YOU THOUGHT BECAUSE OF THIS OR IF WE INCENTIVIZE PEOPLE TO SCALE IT LARGER THAN YOU THOUGHT. BECAUSE FIVE YEARS FROM NOW THE STORAGE IS GOING TO CATCH UP- AND NOW YOU'VE YEAH IT'S EASIER TO HAVE THE STORAGE CATCH UP IF YOU KNOW FOR SURE YOU'VE GOT THE ABILITY TO CREATE. EITHER LOW COST HYDROGEN OR LOW COST OTHERS OTHER STORAGE OPTIONS I GUESS THAT'S WHAT I'M- REFERRING TO SO I. I'M JUST I'M REALLY TRYING TO CHALLENGE THE QUESTION THE ISSUE OF WHETHER. WE SHOULD NOT DO SOLAR UNTIL WE HAVE THE STORAGE OR WHETHER WE- YOU KNOW CAN DO THAT CAN MAKE ALMOST KIND OF LEAPFROG- AS THEY MOVE FORWARD TO SOME EXTENT. ANY FINAL YEAH I. YEAH THIS LONG TO BRING IN A STORAGE CAN MOVE AGREE. ON SOLAR SO. BECAUSE YOU CAN ALWAYS CURTAIL AND- I THINK THE INCREMENTAL COST OF NEW SOLAR SHOWING TO BE QUITE INEXPENSIVE SO IT'S A IT'S NOT A- CHANGE YOUR STRATEGY AND IN TERMS OF GRID RELIABILITY BUT SHE JUST NEED TO MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE STORIES COMING ALONG OR ELSE YOU'RE REQUIRED. TO RELY ON THE OLDER UNITS YOU HAVE THESE DIFFERENT MANAGING ISSUES AND IF YOU ACTUALLY JUST KEEP THE OLDER UNITS ON UNTIL YOU GET THE RIGHT COMBINATION OF STORAGE ON. HAND AND SOLAR SO YOU KEEP IT IS THAT JUST AS A TERMINATION OF WHEN YOU SHUT THE OLDER UNITS OFFICE WHEN YOU HAVE THE PROPER AMOUNT OF STORAGE DEGREE YEAH AND I CALL THAT FRANKLY TURNOVER IT'S VERY NORMAL PROBLEM AND WE SHOULD JUST APPROACH IT AND I THINK. THE LANGUAGE YOU GUYS ARE DEVELOPING TODAY IS ALSO HELPING EVERYONE YOU KNOW- NO DISCHARGED OR WHAT I CALL LONG HOLD STORAGE. IS A PROBLEM WE NEED AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT YOU ASSOCIATE WITH SEASONAL STORAGE THAT'S DIFFERENT THAN- THE DAILY DISCHARGE STORAGE BECAUSE YOU MAY HAVE. A STORAGE THAT IS. HOUSE SELF DEPLETING CHARACTERISTICS BUT IF YOU'RE USING IT EVERYDAY IT'S FUN AND SO AS LONG AS WE CAN IN THIS LANGUAGE AND CLARIFY FOR INDUSTRY WHAT PROBLEMS TO SOLVE. IN MY EXPERIENCE IS THEY'RE THEY'RE WILLING TO SHOW UP FOR CALIFORNIA AND- PLACING BETS IN A GOOD WAY FOR US THANK YOU OUR- MEMBER BENEFITS. I JUST REALLY QUICKLY I HAVE SHOWN THAT IN. JANUARY SO IF YOU BUILD OUT SOLAR YOU'LL HAVE ENOUGH TO MEET THE LOAD HOWEVER THAT'S A MONTHLY NUMBER. YOU STILL HAVE TO QUIT SO HE COULD WITHOUT MUCH SOLAR AND YOU STILL NEED MORE STORAGE TO GET THROUGH THE NIGHT AND TO GET THROUGH A CLOUDY WEEK. AND IT'S JUST THAT YOU DON'T NEED AS MUCH SEASONAL BUT YOU ACTUALLY WHEN YOU DO THAT YOU'RE GOING TO ASK- ALEX WAS JUST SAYING. EVERY TIME YOU ADD MORE SOLAR YOU NEED TO USE TO ADD A COMMENSURATE AMOUNT OF STORAGE TO BE ABLE TO USE THE DAY TIME TO GET THROUGH THE NIGHT. EXCELLENT AND BY THE WAY- I HAD ONE NUMBER THAT THREE AND A HALF MILLION MEGAWATT HOURS THAT CAME FROM DOCTOR KURDS. 1% OF ROUGHLY FORTY MEGAWATTS- IS SORT OF THE KIND OF AVERAGE NUMBER FOR ELECTRICITY GENERATION CALIFORNIA MAYBE IT'S TWENTY OR SIXTY BUT IF. THAT'S IN THE BALLPARK. TIMES THREE SIXTY FIVE TIMES TWENTY FOUR AND YOU GET THREE AND A HALF MILLION MEGAWATT HOURS. SO THESE ARE JUST BALLPARK NUMBERS BUT- THE POINT IS YOU'RE COMPARING A MILLION. TWO FOUR THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED. THAT'S THE KIND OF LEAP THAT WE HAVE TO MAKE AND VERY QUICKLY IF WE'RE TO BELIEVE DOCTOR BERGER WHICH I DO THAT THIS HAS TO HAPPEN BY TWENTY THIRTY. I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A COMMENT ON THIS PLEASE ONE OF THE SO. LOOK WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE WHOLE COMPLETE STORY YET SO THAT'S ANOTHER THING. THE SEATTLE ALSO NOT AVAILABLE IN THE HOME. OVERPRODUCTION BUT YOU WANT ONE FACTORIES WILL GIVE US SIX HOURS RIGHT. WITH THE FACTORY THE ECONOMICAL ECONOMIC OUTPUT OF A FACTOR DEPENDS ON WHETHER IT'S AND I NEED TWENTY FOUR HOURS OF OCT. REACH SO WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN YOU WILL DISCOVER FACT IS IMPLEMENTED IN START BURNING NATURAL GAS IN THE EVENING THE END PRODUCT. SO THAT'S BECAUSE HARD LOOK AT ONE ASPECT OF THE ENERGY ECONOMY AND DON'T FORGET ABOUT THE REST OF THE STUFF PEOPLE BELIEVES. THAT ENERGY. SO THAT IS SOMETHING TO REALLY KEEP IN MIND AND THAT'S- THE SECOND ONE IS I WAS GOING TO SAY WATER INFRASTRUCTURE. TO PRODUCE A LOT OF HYDROGEN. RIGHT NOW HE CANNOT. 100% HYDROGEN IN THIS DEBATE LINE IS NOT POSSIBLE THAT A LOT OF TECHNICAL RISK. WHICH IS WHICH IS A LONG. SO AND THE PEOPLE ARE TALKED ABOUT. WE'RE GOING 2% OF THOSE IN THE MIX WITH NATURAL GAS THAT DOESN'T GET YOU TO A REPRESENTATIVE WILL. EIGHT SO I GOT THAT WILL ALSO DECIDE HOW YOU WANT TO PRODUCE AN URGENT SHOULD BE BORN OKAY DODD WAS A PRODUCTION VOWED THAT USES GOING TO BE. SO DO YOU DON'T HAVE TO DOUBLE UP NEW PIPELINES. WHICH CAN PROTRUSION. SO THESE ARE THE KIND OF CONVERSATION THAT WE EVER HAVE BEFORE DECIDING ON. WHICH STRATEGY MAKES SENSE UN UNFORTUNATELY I'VE SEEN THAT. THERE TENDENCIES TO FOCUS ON ONE PART OF THE PROBLEM. I THINK THAT SOMEBODY HAS MATURED ON THE SPOT WEST OF THE PARK. AND AGAIN WITH THE TAGLINE THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT TEN TO FIFTEEN YEARS. WE NEED TO START LOOKING AT EACH US BACKED OFF. THE PROBLEM ALL THE WAY FROM PRODUCTION TO DELIVERY TO USE. AND WHAT OTHER THINGS DOWNSTREAM EVEN OTHER TALENTED THAT NEEDS TO BE SOLVED. THE STRUCTURES AS BIGOTRY AGAINST. AND MISTER PARK MAY I JUST SPEAK WITHOUT HIGH POINT. YEAH THAT YOU KNOW AND SEE SO WE ARE TECHNICAL SO WE LIKE ALL STORAGE- WELL YOU'RE A BIG INFRASTRUCTURE STORAGE OR SMALL BATTERIES. AND HYDROGEN IS PART OF THE STORAGE TOOL KIT FROM OUR STANDPOINT HYDROGEN ALSO HAS SIMILAR BENEFITS YOU KNOW IT CAN APPLY TO INDUSTRY AND TRANSPORTATION APPLICATIONS. I JUST WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT ALLEY W. HE'S DOING REALLY GREAT WORK AND E'RE AGAIN IN CALIFORNIA YOU KNOW HAVE THE BENEFIT OF. A UTILITY THINKING AHEAD STICKING ITS NECK OUT AND I DO THINK WE SHOULD REALLY LOOK AT IT MAKE SURE THAT THEIR- HYDROGEN EXPLORATION PROJECTS ARE SUCCESSFUL AND ONE OF THE THINGS THEY'RE DOING IS CALLED HIGH DEAL. WHERE THEY'RE GETTING ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS TOGETHER TALK JUST LIKE DOCTOR CRUSHER MACHINE IT SAYING AND THEY'RE HAMMERING THIS OUT WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN WHEN WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ON YOUR SIDE SO THAT I CAN MAKE MY SITE WORK. AND GETTING ALL THAT TOGETHER IS THE TYPE OF COORDINATED TACTICAL APPROACH I THINK MAKES A LOT OF SENSE. AND I THINK FROM A POLICY STANDPOINT LOOKING AT HOW DWP IS CONVERTING ITS- FORMALLY CALL UNIT IN UTAH INTO- HYDROGEN STORAGE- SYSTEM IS SOMETHING THAT. CERTAINLY WE WOULD WANT TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN TERMS OF MOVING THE NEEDLE FORWARD FOR THE STATE. AND YEAH I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT POLICY NEEDS THERE ARE TO FACILITATE THAT BUT I DO THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT ONE THAT WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT FOR. YOU SUPPORTING IT MAKING SURE IT'S SUCCESSFUL OUTSIDER. YES ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF. THESE NEW TECHNOLOGIES WHERE WE'RE GETTING DOWN TO SOME PILOT INVESTMENT. BOY WE HAVE TO DEPLOY SO QUICKLY. IT'S SCARY. I'M MEMBER BENNETT I THINK THAT YOUR- QUESTIONS WERE QUITE HELPFUL AND I BELIEVE THE GENERAL AUDIENCE- IN THE WAY YOU SUMMARIZE THINGS WILL FIND THE WAY YOU UNDERSTAND THAT TO BE VERY HELPFUL TO THEM AS WELL SO THANK YOU FOR THOSE QUESTIONS- NUMBER CALDERON DO YOU. WANT TO ADD ANYTHING. I NEVER GOING TO ASK YEAH HI. YES AND I THINK WAS VERY IMPORTANT- DOCTOR BERGER DID YOU WANT TO SAY ANYTHING MORE. I THINK EVERYTHING HAS BEEN COVERED REALLY WELL HERE I JUST WENT OUT AND OF REEMPHASIZE SOME OF THE POINTS THAT ALEX MADE- THAT IN A REALLY LONG TERM SIGNALS THAT REALLY KIND OF ORIENTING THE MARKET TO ASK THINK ABOUT KIND OF WHERE WE NEED TO HAD AND HOW DO WE PRIORITIZE. BUILDING TOWARDS THAT IS REALLY CRITICAL- YOU KNOW THERE ARE NUMBER OF POLICY MECHANISMS AS IS ALEX MENTIONED- THAT CAN GET US THERE AND I THINK YOU KNOW WE'RE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF DESIGNING THOSE IN A TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL AWAY THAT REALLY ARE FOCUSED AROUND THE PROBLEM. RIGHT SO WE WE'VE WE'VE IDENTIFIED THIS PROBLEM OF NEEDING TO- KIND OF POWER OUR GRADES THROUGH THESE MULTI DAY- PARTICULARLY WINTER ADD IT YOU KNOW OCCURRING LOW RENEWABLE ENERGY EVENTS SO NOW THAT WE'VE KIND OF DEFINED THAT PROBLEM AND PERHAPS WE CAN REALLY WORK TO FIND THAT PROBLEM EVEN FURTHER WORKING WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASKS OVER THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. NO ANSWER TO FIND A PROBLEM HOW WE DEFINE PROGRAMS THAT THEN ORIENT THE MARKET TOWARDS SOLVING THAT PROBLEM AND THE KIND OF ALLOWING THESE- TECHNOLOGY PROVIDERS TO SCALE AND YOU KNOW REALLY CREEPY INVESTMENTS WITHIN THE STATE AND REALLY ACROSS THE UNITED STATES. OTHER NECESSARY IN ADVANCE OF THAT SCALING- AND DO THAT AND KIND OF OUR A REALLY- A WAY THAT ALLOWS US TO MANAGE RISK EFFECTIVELY SO I THINK THAT'S IT THAT'S- REALLY WHAT WE LIKE TO FOCUS ON YOUR- ARM AT THE END OF THIS I WILL TRY AND PUT TOGETHER A ONE TO TWO PAGE SUMMARY OF. WHAT WE LEARNED AND SO I'LL BE GETTING BACK TO THE U. S. SPEAKERS- PARTICULARLY- DOCTOR BERGER YOUR PROJECTION AS TO WHAT WE NEEDED TWENTY THIRTY. I. THINK THAT WAS AN EXTREMELY- IMPORT- ASSESSMENT A ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT IDEAS TO COME OUT OF THIS IS JUST HOW MUCH WE NEED BY TWENTY THIRTY AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A MILLION OR SO MAKE FOR HAPPY HOURS. JUST ALMOST UNBELIEVABLE. AND THEN WE SHOULD FACE THAT NOW. I'M GOING TO GET TO THE NEXT PANEL AND THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH IF YOU WANT TO STAY AROUND WE'RE GOING TO BE TALKING NOW ABOUT WHAT THE ENERGY COMMISSION IS DOING. AND WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS DOING ONE MORE QUESTION THAT QUESTION I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT THAT AT- A FEW MINUTES BEFORE FOR I WILL HAVE TO LEAVE I'M SURE SO IF THE PANELS GOING ON AT YOUR WILL WILL TRY AND FINISH THAT PANEL AT FOUR O'CLOCK AND THEN HAVE A PUBLIC COMMENT THROUGH FOUR THIRTY. OKAY SO- THAT MEANS- FOR THE NEXT TWO SPEAKERS. ONE FOR THE ENERGY COMMISSION AND THE OTHER FROM SANDIA NATIONAL LAB- TO TALK ABOUT. THE NATIONAL EFFORTS AND- THE EARTH SHOT AS THEY'RE CALLING IT. SO FIRST WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM. MISTER MIKE- GRAVELLY- PROGRAM RESEARCH RESEARCH PROGRAM MANAGER THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION- HE'S THE TEAM LEAD IN SEEN OUR SENIOR ELECTRICAL ENGINEER FOR THE ENERGY SYSTEMS RESEARCH OFFER. OFFICE AT THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION HIS TEAM IS MANAGING OVER THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN. MICROGRID ENERGY STORAGE AND RELATED ENERGY RESEARCH AND DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS- SO NOT A MONEY BONTA RESEARCH- MR GRAVELLY- PLEASE GO AHEAD. THANK YOU AND GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN KIRK AND THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS- I WOULD LIKE TO SAY JUST FOR BACKGROUND ON MYSELF I HAVE THAT'S IN YOUR COMMISSION NINETEEN YEARS. I WORK IN YOUR STORE YOU ENTER TIME CARD IN THERE I WORKING YOUR STORAGE AND DISPOSAL GOVERNMENT AND PRIVATE INDUSTRY- I ALSO WANTED FOR BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T TALKED MUCH ABOUT TODAY IF YOU KNOW THE REALLY A TRUE MOST PREDOMINANT LONG DURATION STORAGE WE HEARD A FEW OTHER ONES ARE IN FACT PUMPED HYDRO AND HYDROGEN. AND IN MOST CASES OF PUMPED HYDRO YOU KNOW REPRESENTS OVER 90% OF THE LONG DURATION STORAGE IN CALIFORNIA IN THE NATION AND THE WORLD AND MOST SENATE REPRESENTATIVES TODAY CONCERT A PUMPED HYDRO TO BE MATURE COMMERCIAL AND ENABLE TO PROVIDE LONG DURATION AND SEASONAL STORAGE. INSURANCE DOT COM TIGER WAS PASSED EARLIER IN THE COST OF PUMPED HYDRO PROJECTS IN THE FUTURE CAN CHANGE REALLY BE WELL DOCUMENTED TO- PROJECTS OF PLANES AND COSTS ARE PRETTY WELL KNOWN. AND PERFORMANCE IS PRETTY WELL EXPECT. HI IS A LITTLE. CAL ARE PROPER FOCUS ON HOW. IS CARBON. RENEWABLE I. INSTEAD OF THE CURRENT AVAILABLE FOSSIL FUEL BASED CREATE HYDROGEN AND BLOW HUNDRED YOUR- NOBLE GREEN HYDROGEN STILL VIEWED BY MOST OF THE ALL THE INDUSTRY AS AN EMERGING TECHNOLOGY WHEN CONSIDERING IT FOR LONG DURATION STORAGE ARE FOR- INTEREST A LONG- ARPA SEASONAL STORAGE. THANK YOU COMMISSION HAS INVESTED AND WILL CONTINUE TO INVEST MORE IN THE COMING YEARS TO GRADUATE DEMONSTRATE USE. OF RENEWABLE GREEN HYDROGEN AS A FUTURE ENERGY STORAGE RESOURCE- ALSO NEED. NINETEEN THOUSAND TWENTY THEIR DISCRETION COMPLETED SURE RESEARCH OVER THE FULL SPECTRUM OF HYDROGEN USES. AND LOOK AT THE DECARBONISATION OF HOWHARD IT CAN BE USED IN THINGS LIKE THE DECARBONISATION OF THE INDUSTRY AND- AND AGRICULTURAL VERY HARD. TO DECARBONISE INDUSTRIES- ALSO TO LOOK. TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE EXCESS- EXPECTED FROM HIGH RENEWABLE PENETRATION OR OF A BUILD UP IN CALIFORNIA INCLUDING IF WE IF CALIFORNIA REALIZES ITS OFFSHORE WIND CAPACITY. ADDITIONALLY JUST FOR INFORMATION FOR YOU TO FINISH YOUR MISSION WILL RELEASE A COMPETITIVE SOLICITATION LATER THIS YEAR. TO DEVELOP A GREEN HYDROGEN ROADMAP AND MASTER PLAN. THAT WILL ADDRESS ALL THESE OPPORTUNITIES TO IDENTIFY WHICH ONES HAVE THE MOST POTENTIAL TO SUPPORT. THE GOALS OF SB ONE HUNDRED. THANK YOU COMMISSION HAVE SEVERAL OUR RESEARCH PROGRAM FUNDING SOURCES BY AND BY FAR THE LARGEST IS THE ELECTRIC PROGRAM INVESTMENT CHARGE YOU PRO BOWL BUT ABOUT THAT HERE TODAY. YEP PROBLEM IS CREATED BY THE PUBLIC CHILL COMMISSION AND IS YOUR MINISTER ABOUT ENTRY COMMISSION AND THE THREE ARE YOU. DIFFERENT PROGRAMS NOW THIS CHANCE HERE ON THE PROGRAM HAS INVESTED IN NURTURING YOUR STORES THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE DECADE. THERE ARE YEARS FOR FOCUS ON ENCOURAGING A WIDE RANGE OF NEW AND EMERGING ENERGY STORAGE TECHNOLOGIES TO DEMONSTRATE THE CAPABILITY ON THEIR VALUE TO THE MARKETPLACE. THE RESULTING TECHNOLOGIES FROM THIS TIME FRAMEWORK SHORT DURATION ENERGY STORAGE FOUR HOURS OR LESS BECAUSE THE OVERALL MARKET HAS NOT RECOGNIZED THE NEED FOR LONG DURATION MONITOR STORAGE CAPABILITIES. SEVERAL OF THE COMPANIES RECEIVED OVERSEEING ETHNIC FUNDING WERE ABLE TO ADVANCE OUR TECHNOLOGY WHICH REPORT THAT THEY RECEIVED INTERNATIONAL ORDERS. THEN ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO THE COMMISSION SHADED RESEARCH INTO LONG DURATION STORAGE AS IT BECAME CLEAR THAT SOLUTIONS WERE NEEDED FOR A LONGER DURATION BOTH TO MITIGATE AGAINST FIRE EMPIRE SHUTTLES. INTO ADDRESS PERIODS WHEN RENEWABLE MIGHT HAVE REDUCED CAPACITY FOR LONG HOURS AT A TIME. SEVERAL PROMISING TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS FLOW BATTERIES FLYWHEELS IN ADVANCED CHEMISTRY BATTERIES OR MERGE DURING THIS TIME FRAME. THAT WERE ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE THE POSSIBILITY OF LONG DURATION IN YOUR STORES THE COULD PROVIDE EIGHT HOURS MORE CAPACITY. AS A RESULT OF THIS RESEARCH ENERGY COMMISSION DEVELOPED A NEW LONGER RATIONING YOUR STORAGE COMPETITIVENESS PROTECTION. BUT WAS RELEASED IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. ALSO DURING THIS TIME FRAME DANGER COMMISSION BEGAN TO RESEARCH A SEASONAL ENERGY STORAGE. I LIKE THE HIGHLIGHTS KEY IN. THE POLICY EARLY RESEARCH IN TWENTY TWENTY THERE WOULD YOU COMMISSION AWARDED OVER A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN SEPARATE FUNDS AND MATCH FUNDS. TO TWENTY FIVE ENERGY STORAGE GRANTS TO DEVELOP AND DEMONSTRATE THE FULL SPECTRUM OF IN YOUR STORAGE CAPABILITY SHORT DURATION OF LONG DURATION AND SEASONAL. I DON'T EVEN KNOW THE WORD FOR ACRE. TO CHECK OVER OF INNOVATIVE ENERGY STORAGE TECHNOLOGIES THAT COULD PROVIDE TEN HOURS OR MORE. OF ENERGY STORAGE SYSTEMS IN THE FIELD APPLICATIONS. THREE GRANTS TO BUILD AND DEMONSTRATE THE NEWEST REPORT TYPE SYSTEM AGAIN PROVIDING YOUR STORAGE FOR UP TO ONE HUNDRED HOURS. THREE GRANTS TO ASSESS THE FUTURE. SOLUTION INTEGRATES SEVERAL I DON'T WANT THE FULL SPECTRUM OF LONG DURATION STORAGE. AND ELIMINATE THEM THE LEVEL OF LONG DURATION STORAGE CAPABILITY THAT WILL BE NEEDED TO SUPPORT THE GOALS OF THE STATE UNDER SB ONE HUNDRED. ONE OF THOSE EIGHT CONVERGING LONG DURATION STORAGE TECHNOLOGY ISSUES BASED ON AWKWARD PROPOSED TITLE TECHNOLOGY IN WILL DEMONSTRATE SEASONAL ENERGY STORAGE HOWEVER VERY SMALL SCALE. IN ADDITION TO THE LABORATORY RESEARCH AN INFILL DEMONSTRATIONS EPIC PROGRAM ALSO PROVIDES GRANTS TO EMERGING STORAGE COMPANIES TO EXPAND THEIR MANUFACTURING CAPABILITY IN CALIFORNIA. OVERCOME BARRIERS AND LIMITATIONS ON THE MARKET PLACE AND TO HELP THEM DEVELOP BUSINESS PLANS SO THEY CAN ATTRACT HIGHER LEVELS OF THIRD PARTY INVESTMENT. WHEN LOOKING AT THE DESIRED DISCUSSION TOPIC FOR THE WORKSHOP TODAY THAT WE'VE HAD THROUGHOUT THE DAY THE COMMISSION IS ACTING ACTIVELY WORKING. OF THE STATE TO INSURE OF THE FULL SCALE COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE ENERGY STORAGE TECHNOLOGIES NEEDED TO MEET FUTURE GOALS OF THE STATE. AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS NOW OR AFTER THE NEXT WEEK- I WELL LET TO THE NEXT SPEED THEN- VERY THREE TO HAVE HEAR FROM SANDY NATIONAL LAB. DR BABU. SHALLOW MOLLA. SAID THEIR NATIONAL LABORATORY HE'S THE MANAGER OF THE ENERGY STORAGE TECHNOLOGIES SYSTEMS DEPARTMENT AND PROGRAM MANAGER FOR GRID ENERGY STORAGE OUR PRIOR TO JOINING SNDY IN TWENTY FIFTEEN HE WAS A CORPORATE FELLOW AT MONSANTO. ELECTRONIC MATERIALS COMPANY WHERE HE LED OUR INDIAN PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND THE ENERGY STORAGE TECHNOLOGY- HIS HAD A FOUND IN ROLLING TO SHOW US A START UPS- MADE SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTIONS TO VACUUM AND- MICROELECTRONICS IN FLAT PANEL DISPLAY TECHNOLOGY SHE IS A FELLOW OF THE IEEE E. V. INSTITUTE OF- ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS. AND THEY CAN BE OF SCIENCE IS A SAINT LOUIS AND I COULD GO ON FOR A LONG TIME- HE IS CHAIR OF THE- MRS TRUMBULL. COMMITTEE RECEIVED HIS BACHELOR'S OF TECHNOLOGY AND ELECTRONICS THAT- AND CATCHERS WHO ARE UNIVERSITY AND A PHD IN PHYSICS FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH TEXAS HE'S AUTHORED OVER A HUNDRED AND TWENTY- PAPERS AND HAS NINE U. S. PAN. SO DR- CELLO MOLLENKOPF PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU TO PICK A GOOD AFTERNOON- MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- AND VERY HAPPY TO BE PRESENTING AT THIS MEETING. AS A COMPUTER TECHNICIAN MY NAME IS PUBLIC TELE I'M OUT OF THE STORE PROGRAM MUCH THAT INITIAL S. SUNDAY WE HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE R&amp;D- WORK IN- MAKING STORAGE SAFE RELIABLE COST EFFECTIVE. AUGUST MANY END MARKETS INCLUDING THAT TRANSPORTATION AND STATION IS STORAGE. I AM VERY HAPPY TO FOLLOW ON THE TESTIMONY FROM MY FAMILY YOU KNOW IT'S EASY HAS BEEN A LEADING UP MEDITATION FOR RUNNING FOR PUBLISHING STORAGE IN THE MARKETPLACE- WE HAVE A LONG TERM COLLABORATION WITH- THE ULTRA PRODUCTS MICROGRAM AT THE CC. I THANK- MIKE- PUTS US IN THIS ENGAGEMENT ORDER YES- WE ALSO HAVE A ROBUST- ENGAGEMENT AT THE STATE UC'S AND PROVIDING TECHNICAL BASIS I DO SUPPORT THE POLICY MAKING- MIGHT PRESENTATION- TODAY IS BASED ON THAT ENGAGEMENT THE POLICY AND REGULATORY BODIES FROM THE COUNTRY. I'M SPECIFICALLY ASKED ABOUT US- THE QUESTIONS- BEFORE GOING TO THAT I THINK THIS IS A GOOD TIME FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE POLICY AND REGULATORY ASPECTS. FOR SEASONAL STORAGE. I THINK I'M A GREAT ASSET- SEE MOSTLY VENUE I THINK ENOUGH PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT CIVIL STORAGE WE REALLY DON'T HAVE ANYTHING. AND THE POLICYMAKERS HAVEN'T GIVEN ISSUE- CONSIDERATION ON WHAT IT MEANS. R. AS A MENTION BY- THIS BECAUSE EARLIER- CDS R&amp;B INVESTED RMB AND ENGINEERING ON SEASONAL STORIES I THINK YOU JUST BEGINNING AND IT'S A GOOD TIME TO START EXPLORING WHAT THE WHAT THE POLICY CHALLENGES ARE WHAT CAN UP REGULATE DIFFERENT WHAT CAN YOU DO HAVE. TO ENABLE THIS INDUSTRY. SO COMING TO THAT KEY QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE ASKED ME TO RESPOND TO THE FIRST ONE IS. A WALK IN THE STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS CAN DO TO ENSURE THAT MERGING TECHNOLOGIES CAN MAKE IT FOR THE FIRST EMAIL. VALLEY OF DEATH SICKENING. AS SOMEONE WHO HAS SPENT MUCH OF MY CAREER INDUSTRY BEFORE COMING TO THE LEFT- THE GREATEST UPSET OBSTACLE BUT MOST TECHNOLOGY INCLUDING LONGER THEY SHOULD START A SEASONAL STORAGE. WE GET ALL OF THE VALLEY OF DEATH IS COST. AND FOR THAT PERFORMANCE THANK YOU KNOW. WE NEED TO OFFER. SOME VIABLE ALTERNATIVES TO REPLACE PREDICTION DEMOLITION. FOUR ONE LONG DURATION STORAGE CONCEDES AND I JUST PUT AND ALL THESE- TO MAKE CDS AND WHAT'S- AT THE CURRENT LEVELS- THEY'RE QUITE EXPENSIVE. AND SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS NEEDS TO BE MET- STATE GOVERNMENTS CAN HELP BUT LOOK CLOSELY THINKING ALL OBSERVE COST TO THE BURDEN OF PUTTING IN YOUR STORAGE EXPECT A LONGER TERM. AND SEASON ALSO- COOPER CITY'S TAX INCENTIVES MAY BE AN OPPORTUNITY PROGRAMS WHICH CAN BE FOR SOME OF THE COSTS ARE PROVIDED. THAT RESTRICT OUR IN THAT CASE. AND I THINK I ALSO THINK WE NEED TO HAVE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT SYSTEM PERFORMANCE OF THE WHOLE PEOPLE TALK ABOUT- HOW BUT WHAT ABOUT THE OVERALL SYSTEM EFFICIENCY IS WIDE OPEN. I'M TIRED OF THIS AND THEY NEED TO GO UP MUCH MORE SIGNIFICANT THAN WHERE WE ARE. AND THEN. AREAS OF OPERATION FUNCTIONALITIES HOW DO YOU BRING THESE PRODUCTS TO REALITY ON THAT SCALE. IN THOSE THINGS THAT A LOOK SACRAMENTO COMES UP THAT'S BANQUETING SALAS. I PROGRAM LIKE CZ BRING IN CALIFORNIA. AND ALSO HAVE- DEAL WORLDS AND IF YOU SO BUT WE ALSO OF THE LITTLE ONLY IN THE PROCESS. IN THIS SENSE OF IN USING. HAS BEEN BEATING THE AREA- OTHER STATESYOUR- NOT TO MY SODA JUST AMOUNTS TO WAS TO. A SUPPORT LONGER ACTIONS. BUT MOST OF THESE BUT IT'S AN OF SKILL. TO BECOMES SEASON AND I STORAGE IS THAT THE MOST A LONGER MAYBE HOURS HOURS BUT NOT NECESSARILY ONE CAN SAY THESE ARE. R. D. O. E. R. OF ELECTORS THE I THINK IN THIS IS A OFFICE. AS BEEN SETTLED TO SUPPORTING THE MOST BUT THERE FOR MANY YEARS. AND THIS OFFICE IS JUST BEGINNING TO SEE LONGER ACTION STORAGE AND SEASONAL STORE IN THE- AREA. I TOOK A LOT OF THE ASPECTS AND ALSO YOU KNOW- BRINGING THE CLIP THE BODIES- EDUCATIONAL- INFORMATION- TO DO SO THAT THEY CAN MAKE. THAT A POLICY MAKING. SO ASK FOR UPPER OPEN GOVERNMENTS SO. YOU KNOW THESE USUALLY FROM OUR DEAL YOU FALL. AND THEY DON'T OPPORTUNITIES. THROUGH THE- I AM AND ALSO FOR THE GRANDCHILDREN PROGRAM WHICH WAS ANNOUNCED A YEAR AND A HALF AGO I WHICH I'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT OF. AND THE SECOND QUESTION THE COMMITTEE ASKED ME TO ADDRESS THIS. WHAT POLICY AND THE COLLECTIVE BODY IF EXIST BUT STILL IMAGES STORIES TELLEMENT UNDEFINED. I WOULD SAY YOUR BILL IF YOU CAN OTHER POSSIBLE TO BOOK ABOUT STATE IT USUALLY MEANS RETAIL MARKET. AND AS A FELLOW THAT YOU ASSUME IT'S ENOUGH WHAT THE MARKET THE FEDERAL ELECTIONS. BUT THEY TELL US THAT. BUT A CALM THAT WE LOOK AT THE STATE OUR OTHER PHONE LEVELS. AND UNIQUE- LOOKING SPECIFIC. I DO GIVE YOU A COUPLE EXAMPLES- THERE IS A IF YOU LOOK AT THE NOT THE MARKET THAT IS LEAKING THAT'S THE CONSENSUS OF WHAT A MEETING INVITE LONGER STORAGE. I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE SOME DEFINITIONAL- INFORMATION ON BOARD THE STORAGE OF STUDENTS SO IT NEEDS. AND UP AND EVALUATING- THESE TECHNOLOGIES- FOR THE MARKETPLACE WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT THE SYSTEMS I AM. ESTIMATING AND CAN IT DO INSTANTANEOUS TOWARD THE TAP THE LAUGHING GLASS THAT YOU NEED. AND HOW DOES THE SYSTEM CYCLE FOR- FOR GOOD APPLICATIONS AND WE'RE TALKING OF THE DATA MOST OF THE ASSETS OF TWENTY THIRTY FORTY YEARS SO BASICALLY OPERATORS- HAVE TO HAVE THE CONFIDENCE THESE SYSTEMS CAN CYCLE LIKE PUMPED HYDRO WE NOW HAVE FIFTY LETTERS. AND THAT OPERATIONAL LIFETIME. CAN THESE ASSETS LAST LONGTIME. SO COMPANY AT THE WE GET THIS THINKING IT. AND THEN THE OTHER ASPECT IS APPLICATION BOTH FOR- MONDAY BIRDS AND SEE THE START YOU KNOW I'S KIND OF BUT COMPOUNDED BY FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCES IN TECHNOLOGY SIX. AND ALSO WHAT OTHER POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS AND WHAT THE REAL VALUE. OF OKAY AGAIN THE- A PRODUCT OF LOCALS ALL OPERATORS CAN. CAN MAKE SENSE FINANCIALLY. AND THEN FOR THE MOST WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT LONG. BEFORE US I THINK ONE OF MY COULD BE USED IN THE B. BEING AT THAT'S REALLY ABOUT IT- IS A GOOD THING CAME ABOUT LEAST ANOTHER THINKS. BUT POLICY MAKE. ARE JUST BEGINNING TO SEE OFFENSE. MAY IS A IS A IS THAT HE ASKED SPOT FOR THE NEXT. BUT WE HAVEN'T. TALKED ABOUT ANYTHING BEYOND TEN HOURS. MOST OF THE LONG DURATION I THINK YOU CAN LOOK AT IT- ESPECIALLY THOSE BENEFITS ON BETTER TECHNOLOGY THAT THE BATTERIES. I THINK THAT'LL BE COMING TO THE POINT. POPOVICH HOW CAN YOU WILL GO BEYOND- WHAT HOURS BUT A LOT OF LOT OF IDENTIFICATIONS I THINK IT THAT THAT PROCESS IS STILL A ONE. THEN THERE IS THAT POLICY ASPECTS- THAT THAT THEY CAN DELAY TELEMUNDO FLOW OF MAKING. AND THAT MEETS THE- NEEDS TO HAPPEN QUICKLY. SO THAT WE CAN HAVE A MARKET PLACE FOR- SEASONAL STORAGE. THIS IS WHERE WE HAVE SOME LEVEL OF- POLICY I THINK OF THE- THE POLICY FRAMEWORK IS VERY PRESCRIPTIVE THEN YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE GIVING PREFERENTIAL BATTERIES OR OTHER TECHNOLOGIES. AND THEN- AS I MENTIONED EARLIER I THINK THAT A LOT OF INPUTS MIGHT BECOME AND JEEP REPUBLICAN- WANTED SO BADLY I THINK IT MIGHT BE LOOK AT THE CURRENT REGULATORY FRAMEWORK I DON'T NEED THE CHEMICAL NOT IF YOU'LL I THINK THAT NEEDS TO CHANGE. YEAH AND THEN IF YOU LOOK AT THE LEVEL I THINK- MANY STATES DO NOT HAVE ANY POLICY BENEFITS FOR THE DENTAL. AND THE LONG DIRECTIONS BUT SEVEN DOT. ONLY FOR STATES HAVE. SOME SUBSTANTIAL LEVEL UP A POLICY THAT WOULD MEAN IN A STORAGE. BUT ONLY A FEW LIKE A TWENTY OF THE DOUBLE ADDRESSING ON DIRECTION AND SEE THEM ONLY JUST BEING DROPPED. SO YOU THAT SENSE I THINK IT OFF- YOU SHOULD THE ART INCONSISTENCY IN. CONSISTENT IS IN PARTNERSHIP. THE TERM AND HOW ARE THESE ARE GOING TO BE- THAT'S ONE GO ASK BECAUSE MORE LONGER STORAGE. BUT NOT LIKELY TO EXPENSIVE- ADRIAN NOT SUPPOSE SITES COST SO YOU NEED TO HAVE A GOOD FRAMEWORK ON HOW TO HOW DO YOU- SEE THE OWNERSHIP ISSUES. AND THEN FOR ME TO MARKETS AT THE THAT IT BASS I WOULD BEEN TO OUR SMOKE BACK PLEASE TRY ACTION. OBLIGATIONS SO THEY DID NOT HAVE THE HASN'T BEEN OPPORTUNITY FOR LONG DURATION TO COME INTO THE PARTICIPATING BY. THAT TO CHANGE. THEN THAT EVEN THE IS ABOUT LEVEL WELL THAT'S AT ENOUGH- I YOU LOOK AT IT I THINK- A LONGER AGAINST ALWAYS THAT BE IN. ABSOLUTE WITH HAVE- A GOOD FAMILY FOR- THEY'VE BEEN OPPORTUNITIES FOR US LONGER OF A SEASONAL STORAGE THE WHOLE ACT YEAH. THAT'S A AREA I THINK IT. OF ME GETTING EXT. AND IN PLACES YOU HAVE AT BEST BUY- THE AIM IS TO ENSURE RESULT IT WAS THE- POSSIBLE. AND THAT THEY DO NOT A NOT TO KEEP OF NATION. I CAN TELL TO THE DOLLAR. I THINK IT'S A GOOD ASPECT. AND MAY NOT BE ALL THAT. SO I THINK KNOW THE POLICY- THINGS THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED AND OTHER THINGS WHICH WE DON'T HAVE POLICY IS LOCKED UP I THINK IF YOU WANT TO BRING A TECHNOLOGIST MARKET- ESPECIALLY THOSE WHICH ARE NOT REALLY MATURE I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE AT POLICYMAKERS. WE HAVE A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD FOR THE NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND OTHER ASPECT IS. WHAT DRIVES THE INDUSTRY USE THE STANDARDS OF A FRIEND AND HAVING GOT STANDARDIZED PROCESSES FOR A- A TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS. AND STREAMLINED BUT IT DON'T MATTER. ESPECIALLY AROUND ENOUGH OF YOU TO DO THE COST OF INSTALLATION. OPERATIONAL ISSUES. IT WAS CAN HELP YEAH THOSE ARE THE I THINK THE KEEPER- IN AT THIS LEVEL. OTHER ARTISTS LEVEL ARE HOW DO YOU GETTHEM. NUMBER STORY ALSO STORAGE ACCEPT IN THE MARKET. AND COMING TO THE LOS QUESTION CAN FELLOW FOR SUCH- FUNDING TO BE LEVERAGE TO AID IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF LONG DURATION ENERGY STORAGE I THINK MY ANSWER TO THAT SO WE CAN I CAN LOOK AT- FISCAL TWENTY TWO- PRESIDENTIAL- BUTTON BUTTONS REQUEST OUR OFFICE OF ELECTRICITY ADEQUATELY FOUR HUNDRED NINETY MILLION DOLLARS. FOR A FAMILY OBVIOUSLY SUCH NOT AS MANY A SELLOUT DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS BUT- IF YOU LOOK AT THE BIPARTISAN INFRASTRUCTURE FRAMEWORK- THEN THERE ARE THINGS YOU KNOW. TRANSMISSIONS IS DUMB AND- THE CONCLUSION BILL HAS MADE A MISMATCH FOR LINDA PEANUT TECHNOLOGIES SO THERE ARE LOTS OF OPPORTUNITIES IN THE IN THE END UP COMING. TO A FEDERAL BUDGET. AND THE THEY- OF BILL. WITH THE I JUST RANCHO- WHICH IS AGAIN A- BUT TO HOLD ITS- ON HOW DO YOU DO. AND I JUST. DOMESTICALLY SO THAT- WE CAN ALL THE- WITHIN THE- BY. TWENTY THIRTY. THEN- OVER THE LAST- COUPLE OF MONTHS- NO PRESIDENT BIDEN HAD THAT YOU YOU EXCELLENT IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF. SOME OF THE CRITICAL. INCLUDING BETTER- DO YOU A SIGNIFICANT- HAS COME THAT. THEY'RE GOING TO BE- IT SIX EIGHT AT THE END OF THE ENERGY AT SHARKS- OVER THE NEXT YEAR. HOBBIES ALL THESE I TO CONVICT. HELLO BOOKS. SOME OF THE OUT OF THE TECHNOLOGY- IN THE MARKET MISS- BOTH INSIDE SO THAT WITHIN THERE YES. I'M NOT THOSE- AND TRY TO. YOU SHOULD USE THE FIRST TWO SHE AND I OUR CENTERED ON- ONE DIRECTION STORAGE AND HYDROGEN STROKE SO LONG GREAT THE SHUT I THINK ENOUGH HAS AMBITIOUS TALK AT TO GET THE OVERALL CUTS SYSTEM COSTS BY NINETY PERCENT. OF ADULTS TEMPLES ALSO DIRECTION WITHIN A TICKET. AND THE- YEAH I THINK YOU'RE NOT LOOKING AT ADVANCING BECAUSE GETTING THE GOAL BUT FUNDING RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT NATIONAL LABS BUT STILL DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS DEPLOYMENTS AND- AND GETTING BEAT THAT THE MYSTIC MEDICATION INDUSTRY TO BRING THESE TECHNOLOGIES. THEN THE HEAD AGAIN HAVE CHART- IS- A VERY AMBITIOUS- TO CUT THE COST OF ITEMS- BY EIGHTY PERCENT- TO BRING HADN'T BILL ONE DOLLAR COLLAPSE I MEAN AT THAT POINT BUT ONE DOLLAR A KILOGRAM IT'S BEEN A VERY COMPLICATED WITH NATURAL GAS. OR ANY OF THE OTHER- COME DISTRICTS- SO I THINK IMMA LOOKING AT THE HE'S BEEN. AT INITIATE MANY CAN SEE- THAT A- SIGNIFICANT FOCUS ON THINGS. I RECOMMENDATIONS STORAGE- IN THIS ADMINISTRATION. AND I THINK THERE ARE LOTS OF OPPORTUNITIES TO MOVE THINGS FORWARD VERY QUICKLY. WITH THAT I WILL STOP. TAKING PATIENTS. THANK YOU I'M THANK YOU SO IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT THE ISO EXCUSE ME THAT THE ARM. ENERGY COMMISSION FUNDS RESEARCH BUT NOT. NOT THE KIND OF HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS THAT ARE NATIVE FOR SCALE UP TO WHAT EXTENT DO YOU THINK THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CAN BE PREPARED TO ARM. JOINTLY WORK WITH COMPANIES WHERE THEY'RE INVESTING THEIR MONEY AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS CALLED BUYING DOWN THE COST OF DEVELOPMENT OF THESE PILOT PLANTS AND FRANKLY IN CALIFORNIA FROM WHAT I'VE JUST HEARD. OKAY NEED TO PRODUCE THIS IN LIKE FOR. FIFTY DEVELOPMENT TAKES ANOTHER COUPLE OF YEARS AND IT'S PROBABLY TAKES LONGER EIGHT WE HAVE LIKE FIVE YEARS TO DEPLOY IT- AT ANY RATE DO YOU SEE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT GETTING INVOLVED. IN THESE LARGE SCALE INVESTMENTS. I THINK THAT WITH THE IDEALIZATION THAT THERE ARE TECHNOLOGIES THAT WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT WHAT CDS TOGETHER COUNTRY. AND AND- AND- BASED ON THE AND THE BABY NEW INITIATIVES AND PROGRAMS ARE BEING STRUCTURE. THAT IS A MUCH GREATER LEVEL OF ENGAGEMENT WITH INDUSTRY. THAT SAID I THINK IN ALL THESE A SLOWER PROCESS THIS. BUT THE POLICY AND- AND THE DIRECTION SEEMS TO BE- HOW DO WE ACTUALLY MOVE THINGS FORWARD BUT IT QUICKLY- WITH AND GET YOU THAT THIS INDUSTRY- ANOTHER THING I'LL BRING UP. AND YOU MAY OR MAY NOT BE AWARE OF THIS BUT- IN THE- WE MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE ADDITIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE MONEY. PASSED THROUGH THE SENATE THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT THREE AND A HALF TRILLION DOLLARS AND THAT'S WHERE THEY'RE PLANNING TO DO MOST OF THE MONEY THAT WOULD BUILD ADDITIONAL RENEWABLE RESOURCES. UP FOR LARGE PARTS OF THE COUNTRY- THEY DON'T HAVE THE KIND OF. DEPLOYMENT THAT WE DO ALREADY IN CALIFORNIA. SO FOR THEM STORAGE MAY NOT BE IS IMPORTANT BUT HERE IN CALIFORNIA THAT STORAGE IS GOING TO BE VERY IMPORTANT. DO WE KNOW IF THERE ARE THOUGHT TO CONGRESS ABOUT NOT ONLY- PAYING FOR DEVELOPMENT OF MORE RENEWABLE RESOURCES BUT ALSO STORAGE JUST BUYING STORAGE AS THEY WOULD BUY- RENEWABLE INFRASTRUCTURE. I DON'T KNOW BUT BUT THE FACT THAT WE HAVE IN THE OFFICE OF BOOKING OF THE TECHNOLOGIES AND THE THAT IS A IT'S A IT'S A BIG SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF FOCUS ON NON. DEMONSTRATIONS OF ENERGY STORAGE- IN THE IN THE BUDGET IS. I THINK THEY COULD BE GOOD OPTIONS BUT ALL THE STATE'S BUDGET SCRIPT UNNECESSARILY- CALIFORNIA NEW YORK. ALL RIGHT VERY GOOD- SO- MISTER BRADLEY WOULD YOU LIKE TO COMMENT A LITTLE BIT MORE ON ON HOW YOU SEE- YOU'RE YOU'RE INVESTING NOW IN A LOT OF R. AND D. HOW YOU SEE DEPLOYMENT OF SOME OF THESE. NEW TECHNOLOGIES WE HEARD THREE DIFFERENT ONE FROM DOCTOR KURTZ WE'VE HEARD ABOUT THE IRON- AIR BATTERY WE'VE TALKED ABOUT HYDROGEN. WITH THE ENERGY COMMISSION BE INVOLVED IN- SAY TRYING TO HELP. AT LEAST COME UP WITH POLICY FOR HOW WE DEVELOP- THE PILOT PLANTS AND A SHOW THE FEASIBILITY OF THE SOME STORAGE TECHNOLOGIES. IN LARGE SCALE. IT CERTAINLY I BELIEVE THAT'S A KEY ELEMENT FOR WHAT WE'RE DOING I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT- VERY IMPORTANT TO THINK ABOUT YOU'VE MENTIONED THIS THIS LARGE STORAGE NEEDS AND SPACE SEASONAL COURSES OR OTHER SHORTER DURATION STORAGE BUT ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WE HAVE IN A GROWING BE FORCED COMPANIES JUST TO GET THE INVESTMENT COMMUNITIES INTERESTED ENOUGH TO SEE THE VALUE. THERE IS PROBABLY A THIRD OF THE STATE'S IN UNITED STATES AND HAVE SIMILAR GOALS OF CALIFORNIA FOR ZERO CARBON- INFRASTRUCTURE BY TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIFTEEN SO THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO GROW CALIFORNIA HAS IT SO ONE OF THE THINGS IT'S TO PERFORMANCE AND THE VALUE SO IT IS JUST SOMETHING THE STATE'S GOING TO PAY FOR AND YOU HAVE TO GO DEMONSTRATE VERY ONE THING BUT WHAT WE TRYING DEMONSTRATED FACT THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S GONNA PAY FOR ITSELF AND HAVE A COMMERCIAL OPPORTUNITY. I WOULD USE YOUR FOR EXAMPLE YOU MENTIONED THE FOR MANAGING THEIR SEVERAL COPIES WERE DOING THAT LOOKING AT A HUNDRED HOURS OF STORAGE BUT ONE OF THE CONCEPT IS FOR THOSE TYPES OF HUNDRED OUR STORAGE SYSTEMS IS THEY WOULD OPERATE EVERY DAY CAN BE SELLING ENERGY IN THE MARKET PLACE TO BE I CHAU TELL UTILITIES TENNESSEE CH EVERY DAY IN ADDITION TO HAVING. A FEW DAYS OR A WEEK A CONTINUAL STORAGE WITH THEM SO THEY'RE MAKING MONEY ON THEIR PAY YOUNGER OVER HERE THEIR PAIN OR EXPENSES ON A DAILY BASIS BUT THEN THEY ALSO HAVE THE ABILITY TO BRINGING ONE THIS ONE IS REALLY NEEDED THESE LONGER DURATIONS SO I DO THINK ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WERE FACING AND IS TO CONVINCE THE INVESTMENT COMMITTED BECAUSE ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE WE RUN INTO WHEN YOU SAY WE WANT TO SCALE UP THE SAME VIDEO PROJECT OF A HUNDRED KILOWATTS WE WANT TO GO TO ONE MEGAWATT- FIVE MEGAWATTS. FOR THAT COMPANY TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT THEY NEED IN MOST CASES IN CALIFORNIA AND ELSEWHERE THE UTILITY OR THE CUSTOMER WOULD LIKE TO DO A POWER PURCHASE AGREEMENT A LONG TERM AGREEMENT SIX TEN FIFTEEN TWENTY YEARS AND SO THEY HAVE TO BE AN INVESTMENT A CAPABILITY THAT WILL DO THAT AND SO THE WORK THAT WE DO IS TRYING TO PROVE TO THAT COMMUNITY THAT THIS TECHNOLOGY IS REAL. THE COMPANY IS REAL THE TO TECHNOLOGY WORK AND IT'S TO. UP THANK YOU YOUR CALL. WHEN YOU AT THE PARK. CALIFORNIA THE- ARE COUNTRY. THERE IS A RAY. GROW OF MANAGED. BUT IT'S TO END UP NEEDING CUT THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY NEEDS ON. HOW THOSE PROBLEMS ACROSS BASIS. CAN ACTUALLY OF PAY THEM SO WITH THE- THEY PROVIDING. TO THE UTILITY TOOK AGREE. AND TO THE STATE- THEY ARE DIFFERENT. THAT I SEE. ARE FOR THIS SEASONAL. STORAGE IF WE GO TO. A WHAT WAS BROUGHT UP BY- DR BURGER. THERE IS GOING TO BE A YEAR OUT THERE. WHERE WE'RE GONNA NEED A HUNDRED HOURS OF STORAGE OR SOMETHING LIKE A HUNDRED HOURS OF- TO REDUCE POWER ON THE ORDER OF TWENTY GIGA WATCH FOR HUNDRED HOURS. MAYBE ONCE EVERY THIRTY YEARS BUT YOU CAN'T AFFORD. NOT TO HAVE THAT HUNDRED HOURS IN RESERVE. BUT ORDINARILY YOU'RE ONLY GONNA NEED. MAYBE FIVE HOURS OR TEN HOURS AT MOST YOU'RE NOT GOING TO NEED A HUNDRED UP ONCE EVERY TEN YEARS I THINK HE SAID SOMETHING LIKE IT'S FIFTY HOURS AND YOU KNOW THEY SELL ONE CASE WERE WITH A HUNDRED DOWN FOR THIRTY YEARS WORTH OF DATA. SO YOU'VE GOT STORAGE THAT IS GOD SOMEHOW OR ANOTHER A HUNDRED HOURS WORTH OF STORAGE BUT ON A DAILY BASIS YOU'RE ONLY USING ABOUT FIVE HOURS. THE ECONOMICS OF THIS ARE NOT GOOD- WE HEARD FROM DR KIRCH TALKING ABOUT THE STRATEGIC PETROLEUM RESERVE WHICH YOU HAVE FOR EMERGENCIES. IT'S NOT GOING TO EVER PAY FOR ITSELF A HUNDRED HOURS WORTH OF STORAGE WHEN YOU'RE USING FIVE OR IF MOST CHEN. ON A DAILY BASIS IT'S JUST NOT GOING TO PAY FOR ITSELF SO I THINK. WELL IT WOULD HAVE TO BE PAID FOR BY RATE PAYERS OR SOME OTHER INVESTMENT BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO BE I THINK COMMERCIALLY SOMETHING. WELL IN THE END REPAIRS TO PAY FOR ALL THE ELECTRICITY THE POINT IS THAT THIS IS A HUGE AMOUNT OF STORAGE THAT YOU'RE PAYING FOR AND VERY SELDOM GET TO USE. SO YOU KNOW THE COSTS ARE HIGH. YOU'RE NOT GETTING THAT DAILY- REVENUE. AND IT MEANS THE COST OF ELECTRICITY IS GOING TO BE QUITE HIGH. THAT IS THE QUESTION THAT I WILL POINT OUT YOU MENTIONED EARLIER ABOUT BUT BOTH DR COURAGE AND ARE WITH BIGGER FROM FOR FOUR MINUTES YOU HAVE THE TWO DIFFERENT GRANTS WE HAVE WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT THE WHOLE QUESTION. OF LONG DURATION SEASONAL STORAGE AND WHAT THE ROLE IS IN CALIFORNIA NOW IF IT'S JUST BE ONE HUNDRED. SO IT IS A TOUGH QUESTION. IT IS AN AREA WHERE YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THE WHOLE SYSTEM IN OTHER WORDS OF MAYBE JUST EMERGING STORAGE BY ITSELF IS NOT THE ONLY SOLUTION. WE TALKED ABOUT LOOK VEHICLES AND- THE DOCTOR CHRIS MENTIONED YOU KNOW HOW TO TURN THE TRUCKS BEING ABLE TO BE A GREAT ASSET. CALIFORNIA'S LARGEST EFFORTS PERCENT LOOK AT VEHICLES IN THE COUNTRY IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE A LARGE ROADS WE CAN VERY VOCAL HAVE. THEM AS AN ASSET IT FOR THOSE TYPES OF THINGS SO I THINK IT DEMAND RESPONSE IS A BIG EFFORT IN CALIFORNIA TROOPS AND LOAD MANAGEMENT SO I THINK. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE SOLUTION AND I AGREE WITH YOU ONE PERSON ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WE FACE AND WON THE CHALLENGES WE WANT TO FIGURE OUT IS HOW DO WE ADDRESS JUST. FOR YOUR CORRECT CALIFORNIA IS NOT THE TOP ONE TO SAY OKAY WE'RE GOING TO HAVE POWER YOU KNOW- BUT TWICE A YEAR YOU CAN EXPECT TO LOSE EVERYTHING I HAVE TALKED ON THE WORK WE HAVE TO FIND A SOLUTION FOR EVERYTHING. AND SO I THINK WE JUST NEED TO LOOK AT IT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE HOPING TO DO IS TO DO THAT BALANCED APPROACH AND TO LOOK AT THE DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS TO DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGIES. ONE OF THE INTERESTING THINGS I CAN SHARE YOU KNOW WITH THE GRANTS THAT WE ARE HAVING AT THE END OF. ESTIMATED COST THAT THE GREAT TO USE REQUESTED MEETING IS SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER THAN IF YOU MY INTEREST IN THE FORTY WILL MAKE COMPETE AND FUTURE AND HAVE A SPREADER SOLUTION IN THIS PLACE STATE COULD BE PAYING SUBSTANTIALLY LESS. THAN DEMOCRATIC TODAY SO YOU KNOW THE ONE THING THAT LITHIUM ION DOES FOR THE MARKET PLACE I'VE BEEN IN AS LONG AS I HAVE. IS A SENSE OF PRICE POINT IN THE PERFORMANCE POINT THAT EVERYBODY HAS TO BE ARE- THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO COMPETE IN THE COMMERCIAL MARKET CHOI DOES GIVE US THAT BUT I DO THINK YOU YOU HAVE DEFINITELY HIT. AN AREA WHERE THERE'S A CLEAR NEED. I DON'T THINK IT'S TOMORROW BUT YOU'RE CORRECT TWENTY THIRTY TWENTY FORTY OF MADE UP WE THINK WE CAN MAYBE CAN'T. WAIT TO TWENTY FORTY FIVE. BUT I DO THEY- WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE UP. AND I DO. SOME OF THE- EMERGING. THAT WE HAVE HAVE A LOT. I THINK STATE TIGER THE MORE POPULAR. TECHNOLOGY IN THE- MOST OF PROGRAM TECHNOLOGY IN THE WORLD. IN IT HAS A ROLE TO PLAY IN THE JUST LIKE EVERY OTHER TO. DOES REAL QUESTIONS NO TO BE YOU KNOW WHAT CAN WE LIVE WITH ON A COMPOUND HE KAMALA BASIS AS WE GROW DISTRICT. AND HELD A WEEK JUST TO FIVE. THE COST THAT WE'RE PAYING IN THE SERVICE FOR GETTING AND SO THAT'S AN AREA THAT WE SPEND A LOT OF TIME ON IN OUR RESEARCH IS JUST TRYING TO MAKE THAT TRADE OFF. BETWEEN WHAT IS THE PERFORMANCE WE NEED AND WHERE ARE WE WILLING TO PAY FOR IT AND HOW CAN WE DO THAT IN A MANNER WHERE WE INTEGRATE DRINKS. AND PAY LESS MAYBE A HALF OR A THIRD OF WHAT IT MIGHT BE IF WE DIDN'T INTEGRATE THOSE DIFFERENT CONNECTIONS TOGETHER YES. I'M NUMBER CLERK. I'M GONNA MAKE MY- AND I I'D LOVE TO HEAR. IS THAT WAS- TALKING ABOUT PUMPED HYDRO. IN THE WHOLE COUNTRY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND MEGAWATT HOURS OF STORAGE. THAT'S FROM A WIKIPEDIA ARTICLE IT'S PROBABLY RIGHT TO WITHIN A FACTOR OF TWO OR SO. NOT SURE HOW MUCH THE REASON CALIFORNIA BUT IT'S PROBABLY ON THE ORDER THAT'S A FAIR AMOUNT AND IT'S MORE THAN BATTERIES OR ANYTHING ELSE BUT- AGAIN FOR SEASONAL STORAGE WE'RE GOING TO NEED BILLIONS. A MEGAWATT HOURS I DON'T HAVE AN EXACT NUMBER BUT JUST TALKING TO THE EXPERTS HERE TODAY. YOU KNOW WITH. THIS SORT OF SMALL- HOW CAN I SAY JUST BACK OF THE ENVELOPE CALCULATIONS IT COMES TO MILLIONS. IF WE HAVE TWENTY FIVE OR FIFTY THOUSAND HERE IN CALIFORNIA. OF THAT AND IT TO SCALE UP. TO GO FROM TO TWENTY FIVE OR FIFTY THOUSAND TWO MILLION IS JUST HUGE AND IT TAKES A LONG TIME AT LEAST TEN YEARS TO. BUILD ONE OF THESE PROJECTS PROBABLY ANOTHER TEN YEARS TO GET IT PERMITTED. SO IT'S A TOUGH PROBLEM I THINK THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE AND- HOW CAN WE DEPLOY THIS QUICKLY ENOUGH TO MATTER HOW CAN WE MAKE SURE AS DR RAM. FROM- A LARGE BERKELEY SAID IT IT TAKES A LONG TIME TO DEVELOP THE TECHNOLOGIES AND LONGER STILL TO DEPLOY THEM SO WE ARE IN AN EMERGENCY HERE I THINK THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE IF THIS WHOLE HEARING. OKAY WHO WHAT WHAT IS GOING ON OR SAYING ONE THING GO AHEAD I JUST CALLED ONE HUNDRED THINGS ARE GONNA GET WE DO HAVE A TEN YEAR HISTORY. OF WORKING ON ALL TECHNOLOGIES IN RECENTLY WE WERE GOING THROUGH JUST A TERM WHO COULD HELP US WITH SOME OF THE HEAT RANGE AND WE HAVE BABY. THIRTY TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE DIFFERENT THAT WE WORK WITH AND IT'S PROBABLY EIGHT TO TEN OF THEM HAVE GOT TO THE POINT WHERE THEY'RE READY FOR RAPID SCALE UP AND SO THERE AND THERE'S ANOTHER TWO OR THREE TO BEAT. JEFF WAITED TILL LATER SO WE DO HAVE A LONG HISTORY OF WORKING THIS CHALLENGE AND WE DO HAVE OPTIONS AND AGAIN EVERYBODY YOU RECALL TODAY. MOST OF WHAT HAPPENED AT THE GRANT SOMEWHERE IN THEIR HISTORY. AND SO WE'RE FORTUNATE TO DO THAT BUT I DO THINK YOU KNOW AS WE GO FORWARD YOU KNOW WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO LEVERAGE WHAT WE'VE LEARNED AND TAKE SOME RISKS WITH SOME OF THE COMPANIES THAT WE THINK ARE READY. BECAUSE I WOULD AGREE WE CANNOT GET THIS ON A HUNDRED KILOWATTS OF THE TIMER ONE MEGAWATT WEEK WE DO TEND TO MAKE A WATCHING WE NEED. TO ENSURE WE GET TOGETHER TODAY HERE KEEP SENATE BABY THOUSAND MEGAWATT HOURS WE NEED. TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS AND WE JUST GOT TO FIND THE RIGHT WAY TO DO IT SO THAT WE CAN MEET OUR NEEDS AND- IN AN ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND WE DON'T HAVE THIS BIG. COST THAT WE'RE PUTTING OUT THERE PERCENT BEEN RESTORED ONCE IN THE SUMMER OVER THREE MONTHS YOU MAY USE IT FOR TEN DAYS IN THE WINTER WE DON'T USE IT THE NEXT YEAR. BUT WE HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO MEET THOSE NEEDS AND I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF WHAT CHOICES THAT WE HAVE. AND THAT'S A PROMISING START OR DO YOU THINK I MEAN I'VE BEEN INVOLVED THIS A LONG TIME I SEE MORE PROMISED MORE OPPORTUNITY AND MORE INVESTMENT. IN STORAGE NOW OPEN AND PROBABLY THE PREVIOUS TWENTY FIVE YEARS THAT I WAS IN THE INDUSTRY. SO I JUST THINK THERE'S A LOT OF HOPE BUT I DO THINK YOU'RE ASKING SOME TOUGH QUESTIONS- WE'RE GOING UP TO THINK ABOUT YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO INTEGRATE YOUR AND YOUR POLICY REPORT AT THE COMMISSION. THIS MAY BE A QUESTION DETECTING SHOULD LOOK AT AND ONE OF OUR FUTURE GREAT POST REPORTS JUST HOW DO WE ADDRESS THIS LONG TERM STORAGE NEEDS. AND HOW DO WE BEGIN TO PLAN FOR THAT BECAUSE I THINK YOU KNOW IT ACTUALLY I WATCHED WHAT I THINK. THREE YEARS AGO WHEN WE STARTED THIS LONG STORY SEPARATE I HAVE A UNIVERSITY OF CUT I MEAN A GROUP OF STUDENTS FROM STANFORD. COOKING. TO ME LOOKING FOR A PROJECT I SO. I WILL GIVE YOU SIMPLE PROJECT. I WILL GIVE IT. COME TO CALL. BUT I DON'T KNOW WORKABLE. VERSION I WANT YOU TO CALL. IN EACH OF ASKHAM. WHY YOU'RE- IN A TECHNO. THAT NO. SHOULD WE NEED. AND COURSE. EVERYBODY THEY WERE. FOURTH BUT I'M JUST. WAS YOU. AGO THREE TO FOUR. YEARS AGO. LOW STORE. WAS NOT CONSIDER. URGENT NEED. AND I THINK. TODAY WE SEE OKAY. PART OF THE MIX. THE HAVE TO BE PART OF A I WOULD NOT GO. BILL MAKE. FUTURE. THAT'S GREAT NOW WHO WILL SERVE. TO SPEAK. SAYS SINCE I CAN SEE IT RECOGNIZE YOU JUST SHOUT OUT. AND- BE GLAD THAT GOT. REAL APPRECIATE THAT A AFTER AT THE AND THIS KIND AGAIN FORMAT- I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY A COUPLE- TO AN ADDER TO- WOOD MISTER GRAY THEY WERE SAYING. AS THE FIRST ONE I'M GONNA. IT IN THE NOW THAT WE DID. WITH THAT COUGH PUBLIC UTILITIES. DATA WE HAVE FOUND THAT THE ONE OUR REMOVE ENERGY SHORTFALL. HAPPEN ONE EVERY TEN YEARS NOT ONCE A THIRTY. THE THESE HAPPEN OF WITHIN THE RELIABILITY PLANNING STANDARDS UP TO DATE AND THE FIFTY OUR SHORTFALLS ACTUALLY HAPPEN EVERY OTHER YEAR. THESE ARE AT THEIR KNEES ARE ACTUALLY VERY COMMON IT AND SO. WHAT I WOULD EMPHASIZE THAT IN IN IN THIS IS THE POINT THAT BUILT ON WHAT BANISTER GREAT GREAT IT WAS JUST SAYING IS THAT. WE EXPECT THESE LONGER DURATION OR MULTI DAY STORAGE TECHNOLOGIES TO BE PARTICIPATING IN THAT CASE- MARKETS AND YOU KNOW OTHER ENERGY MARKETS EVERY SINGLE DAY EARNING REVENUES EVERY SINGLE DAY. AND ON TOP OF THAT THEY HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO POWER US THROUGH THESE THESE- LOW RENEWABLE ENERGY EVENTS THE SHORTFALLS. AND SO I WOULD I JUST WOULD- WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO KIND OF PAY TO SIT AROUND AND DO NOTHING FOR THE ONCE EVERY THIRTY YEARS. THESE ARE THINGS THAT WE REALLY DO BELIEVE WILL BE ECONOMIC. WITH THE RIGHT SUPPORT AND KIND OF THE RIGHT RAMP UP OVER TIME I SAY WE CAN ENTER THE MARKET AND REALLY PARTICIPATE ON A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD. YUP. BUT ON THE DAY TO DAY BASIS. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE USED. A HOURS TO STORE YOU'RE GOING TO BE. SAY FIVE. AND YOU CAN MAKE YOUR MONEY. IN THIS DAILY WORK JUST WITH FIVE. BUT WE NEED A HUNDRED. AND SO THAT'S TWENTY TIMES THE BEING IT LEAST INVESTMENT IN HARDWARE I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IT COUNTS FOR OVERALL BUT THE POINT IS. NOBODY'S GOING TO BE OUT THERE AND THINKING OH I'M GONNA SELL A HUNDRED HOURS EVERY TEN YEARS AND SO WELL BUILT TO THAT CAPACITY NOW. DAILY BASIS FIVE HOURS THAT'S WHAT WE NEED THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE GONNA BELTED- YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET A VENTURE CAPITAL GUY I DON'T THINK. WHO SAYS OH WELL- YOU KNOW. THE PRICE OF ELECTRICITY WILL BE SO HIGH IN THAT YEAR. THAT WILL MAKE ALL OUR MONEY BACK THAT'S PROBABLY YOU KNOW TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A MEGAWATT HOUR SUNSET YOU'RE MORE. BUT YOU HAVE TO DO TO GET YOUR INVESTMENT BACK. ON HUNDRED HOURS. AND YOU CAN GET THE FIVE OUR INVESTMENT IN OUR EVERYDAY. SAM OKAY- OTHER COMMENTS DR KURTZ. WHERE DO YOU HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENT IF SO SPEAK UP OR FOREVER HOLD YOUR PEACE. ANYONE ELSE ALL RIGHT THEN I THINK WE'VE WE'VE ENDED UP THE PANEL PORTION UMBRELLA PUBLIC COMMENT AND I THE SPEAKERS HERE BEEN FANTASTIC AND I WANT TO THANK MY STAFF- PER PARTICULARLY MARIE CANAL HAS A SCIENCE FELLOW IN HIS UP WITH ME HERE ON THE DAIS.

AND I WOULD NOW LIKE TO TURN THE CALL OVER TO LINE THIRTEEN PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME. GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS ALAN APPS WITH THE BAY AREA. AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT THANK YOU FOR HAVING THIS IMPORTANT AND INFORMATIVE HEARING I WANTED TO TAKE A MOMENT TO BRING THE COMMITTEE'S ATTENTION TO LOCAL AGENCY PROGRAMS THAT CAN BE HELPFUL. IN ADDRESSING STORAGE SUCH AS THE BAY AREA H. U. M. D.'S CLIMATE TECH FINANCE PROGRAM. WHICH BRIDGES THE FINANCIAL GAP FOR CLEANTECH ENTREPRENEURS. WITH LOAN GUARANTEES. IT OFFSETS RISK FOR ARE PARTNERING LENDERS AND INCREASES ACCESS TO CAPITAL FOR ENTREPRENEURS AND THE PROJECTS. OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS THE BAY AREA HMD HAS CONDUCTED OUTREACH TO OVER ONE THOUSAND ORGANIZATIONS. POSTED TECHNOLOGY SHOWCASES VETTED POTENTIAL TECHNOLOGIES FOR FUNDING AND WORK WITH ENTREPRENEURS COULD TRANSITION DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS IN THE MARKET GROWTH. WE'VE BEGUN PARTNERING PROJECT WITH LENDERS MOST RECENTLY INCLUDING HYDROGEN FUEL CELL TRANSPORTATION TECHNOLOGY. AND SOLAR BATTERY MICRO GRIDS FOR FACILITIES AROUND THE BAY AREA. LOCAL PROGRAMS LIKE THE CLIMATE TECH FINANCE PROGRAM CAN HELP ACCELERATE CLEAN ENERGY TECHNOLOGY. INCLUDING STORAGE BY CAN I. THE NONTRADITIONAL AGENT THE EXPERTS AND I ENCOURAGE YOU TO KEEP PROGRAMS LIKE THIS IN MIND THE LEGISLATURE COULD ASSIST AGENCIES LIKE THE BAY AREA HMD IN HELPING MORE OF THESE PROJECTS TO PARESH PERMISSION. I'M HAPPY TO PROVIDE ANY INFORMATION ABOUT THE PROGRAMS AFTER THE HEARING THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND I AND- THE SELECT COMMITTEE ARE DEFINITELY INTERESTED. IF YOU CAN. EMAIL MAYOR OR MY STAFF AND- AND SEND US- JUST SOME INFORMATION ON YOUR PROJECTS ARE WILL BE VERY INTERESTED TO HEAR ABOUT IT THANK YOU. OCT GO AHEAD- THANK YOU WE HAVE NO ONE ELSE IN Q. PLEASE CONTINUE. OKAY WELL- YOU KNOW I'VE LEARNED A LOT TODAY- AND I THINK THIS SERGEANTS WHO ARE HERE. ARM I NOTICED THEM LISTENING WITH RAPT ATTENTION. AND I THINK THEY LEARNED SOMETHING TOO AND- WE COURSE HAVE QUITE A FEW FEW VIEWERS ONLINE. WHAT I'VE LEARNED- TALKING TO IS THAT WE'RE GONNA NEED A LOT MORE STORAGE BY TWENTY THIRTY. THAT BY TWENTY FIFTY WE NEED A NUMBER WHICH IS MILLIONS COMPARED TO WHAT WE HAD MILLIONS OF MEGAWATT HOURS COMPARED TO WHAT WE HAVE NOW WHICH IS TENS OF THOUSANDS SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SCALING UP BY A FACTOR OF A HUNDRED BETWEEN NOW AND TWENTY FORTY FIVE WHEN WE WANT TO HAVE. A RENEWABLE GRID. LET ME SAY AGAIN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT YEAH AND ROUGH NUMBERS A HUNDRED. TIMES AS MUCH STORAGE MOST OF THE STORAGE NOW BEING- A HYDRO BUT- BATTERIES BECOMING A BIGGER AND BIGGER PART OF THAT THE BATTERY IS NOT ABLE TO WORK ON A SEASONAL BASIS. LITHIUM ION BATTERIES OTHER TECHNOLOGIES OTHER TYPES OF BATTERIES YES AND WE HEARD ABOUT ONE OF THEM THE IRON AIR BATTERIES TODAY- SO. THERE'S SOME THERE'S A LOT OF RESEARCH GOING ON. SOME OF THESE TECHNOLOGIES SOUND LIKE THEY'RE READY TO GET OUT THERE AND WE'RE GOING TO NEED THEM IN TWENTY THIRTY. AND SELL IT. YOU KNOW WE TALK ABOUT THE CLIMATE CRISIS TO MAKE THAT CRISIS WE HAVE A CRISIS NOW IN DEPLOYING ENOUGH STORAGE SO THAT WE CAN REALLY MEET OUR GOALS IN TWENTY THIRTY AND IN THE TWENTY FORTY FIVE FOR DECARBONIZING THE GRID AND EVENTUALLY DECARBONISING OUR SOCIETY. SO THAT'S THE CHALLENGE WE HAVE. I THINK THAT CAME INTO CLEARER TODAY AND- I THINK WE DID SOME GOOD WORK I WANT TO THANK AGAIN ALL THE SPEAKERS IN MY STAFF PARTICULAR MARIE CANAL. AND I CALL THIS HEARING TO AN END.
