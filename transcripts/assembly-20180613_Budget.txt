MISS COST US SO WE'VE HAD MANY MANY DISCUSSIONS OVER THE LAST WEEK AND A HALF ON THIS -- WHEN ALL THE DUST IS SETTLED NOW WE'VE GOT WHAT IS PRETTY A FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE BUDGET HERE? BUT WITH THE EXCEPTION THE FACT THAT WE'RE STILL INCREASING STATE SPENDING MY OVER 9% WHEN WE DID THE MATH SO JUST CURIOUS AT THE DISNEY ADMINISTRATION CONSIDER THAT A REASONABLE. LEVEL OF INCREASE YOUR HEREBY CAPE WE JUST WERE NOT ERA WHEN -- INFLATION IS RUNNING ABOUT 3% AND STATE POPULATION GROWTH IS UNDER 1% SO. A 9% INCREASE IN STATE SPENDING SEEMS A LITTLE ALARMING WHICHEVER THAT -- AYE IT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT WE LOOK AT I WOULD KNOW THAT STATE SPENDING IS PREDICATED ON SEVERAL DIFFERENT FACTORS INCLUDING CASELOAD GROWTH ON IN SOME OF OUR PROGRAMS INCLUDING AND CAL GRANT FOR EXAMPLE ARE CAL WORKS -- AS WELL AND I'VE KNOW THERE ARE SOME AND INCREASES ASSOCIATED WITH A NEW PROGRAMS BUT FOR THE MOST PART WE'VE REALLY TRIED TO LIMIT THOSE TO HAVE BEEN ONE TIME IN NATURE [inaudible] THANK YOU AS FAR.

SURE THERE WILL BE AN ITEM LATER ON IN THE AGENDA WITH THE SPECIFIC NEW RESERVE ACCOUNTS BUT RIGHT NOW WE HAVE PROPOSITION TWO WHICH IS THE CONSTITUTIONAL BUDGET AS STABILIZATION ACCOUNT.

ON AND ONE FOR MEDI CAL. I'M IT CREATES THE FIRST DEPOSIT INTO THE CAL WORKS SUB ACCOUNT. AND THEN LASTLY WE HAVE THE BUDGET DEFICIT SAVINGS ACCOUNT WHICH WILL WORK AS A MECHANISM FOR THE PROP TWO PAYMENTS. IT'S PREDICATED ON OUR REVENUES THAT NUMBER CHANGES OVER TIME I'M WE HAVE A NUMBER OF TRUE UP PROVISIONS. SO WE WILL A DEPOSIT THE DOLLARS INTO THAT ACCOUNT THEY WILL STAY THERE ANA AND TELL WE KNOW THE FINAL AMOUNT REQUIRED TO BRING AND THE BUDGET STABILIZATION ACCOUNT UP TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL TARGET.

BUILT TO SUIT CHP OFFICE FACILITY TO REPLACE THEIR EXISTING TRACY OFFICE. THANK YOU BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS ON S. B. EIGHT FOUR EIGHT MISTER BELOW. SO. AMONGST THE PROVISIONS OF THIS TRAILER BILL IS A ONE DOLLAR INCREASE -- FOR FEES FOR THE I HAVE A CONCERN ABOUT THAT BECAUSE WE ARE GETTING LOTS OF COMPLAINTS IN MY DISTRICT AND I THINK. BUT DISTRICTS ACROSS CALIFORNIA THAT PEOPLE ARE HAVING TO WAIT IN LONG LINES AT THE DMV. BECAUSE OF WHAT THE PROBLEMS THE REAL IDEA CAUSING AND AND THAT A LACK OF AVAILABLE AYE PERSONNEL THERE AND I KNOW THE DMV IS IS WORKING ON THAT PROBLEM BUT IT SEEMS COUNTERPRODUCTIVE TO BE DIS INCENTIVIZING BEHAVIOR THAT TAKES PEOPLE. OUT OF THE DMV OFFICES AND GETS THEIR PROBLEMS SOLVED IN THEIR REGISTRATIONS RENEWED WITHOUT HAVING TO GO TO THE DMV IS SO I'M JUST WONDERING WHY -- IT MAKES SENSE TO INCREASE THE FEE AND DIS INCENTIVIZE THAT BEHAVIOR. MARK BURNETT HEARD FINANCED I'M. IN TERMS OF OUR PROPOSAL IS A THREE YEAR SPEAKERS IN A THREE YEAR. ONE A ONE DOLLAR FEE INCREASE AND M. CAN OF TO YOUR POINT -- THE OUR PROPOSAL NON IS TO NOT TRANCE NOT TO MOVE THAT ON TO INTO THE CUSTOMER SO THAT WE CAN DIS INCENTIVIZING ACTION THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WOULDN'T. TAKE PLACE -- RIGHT NOW -- WHEN -- A SEED YOU GOING TOOK A DEALER HIT BY A CAR -- THE IS THE DEALER WILL CHARGE YOU -- IF YOU WANNA GO TO REGISTER TO THE DEALER THERE'S A FOUR DOLLAR FEE. THAT -- THAT YOU'LL PAY FOR THAT THE OF THE A FIVE DOLLAR UP TO TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS CONVENIENCE FEE THAT CAN BE PAID -- BUT IN TERMS OF THE ADDITIONAL DOLLAR TO PAY FOR AN UPGRADE TO A CALTRANS AYE TESIS -- HELD UNDER DMV'S -- MIGHTY SYSTEM -- THAT WOULD NOT GET PASSED ON TO THE CUSTOMER. OKAY THAT THAT'S DEFERRED INFORMATION THAT I HAVE WHAT AT WHY DO YOU THINK THAT. THESE COMPANIES WOULD NOT PASS THAT DOLLAR FEE INCREASE ON THE CUSTOMER. BECAUSE WE PUT IN THE TRAILER BILL THAT THEY COULD NOT. THEY CAN'T CHRIS SO BUT IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE. INCREASING THEIR FEES ARCHER JUSTIFIES DISINCENTIVE EYES IN THEIR BEHAVIOR AND HELPING THE DMV ALLEVIATE THIS CONGESTION WELL -- THEY CURRENTLY HAVE THEY CAN CHARGE IS TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS CONVENIENCE FEE. I'M TWO PEOPLE TO TO CUSTOMERS BUYING CAR SO -- THIS WOULD POTENTIALLY THEN COME OUT OF THAT WOULD BE A DOLLAR LESS IF THEY WERE COLLECTED THAT OR THAT THEY WOULD GET TO KEEP FROM THAT FEE. SO -- IF TO THE EXTENT THAT THE ONE OF THE TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS. DISINCENTIVE EYES IS THAT I DON'T THINK THAT WOULD BE THE CASE. WHILE BOTH WERE TO CONTINUE THIS DISCUSSION OFFLINE BUT I I HAVE THIS A CONCERN I WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE DO AS MUCH AS WE CAN TO GET CONGESTION OUT OF THE DIEM THE OFFICES AND AND I CONCERNED THAT THIS WAS GOING TO WORKING AGAINST. IN OPPOSITION TO THAT SO WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT OFFLINE THANK YOU FRANCINE QUESTION. THANK YOU ANY OTHER. QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE OKAY -- SUPPORT FOR S. B.. EIGHT FOUR EIGHT SEE NO SUPPORT OPPOSITION HAS PAID FOR IT. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MARK WHITE AND ON BEHALF OF MOTOR VEHICLE SOFTWARE CORPORATION. WE ARE A AND ANY THAT IS INVOLVED IN PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS WITH THE DMV THE VERY ENTITIES. ASSEMBLY MEMBER OBERNOLTE WAS TALKING ABOUT WERE CALIFORNIA BASED COMPANY ABOUT TUNER FIFTY EMPLOYEES. AND HERE'S WHAT WE DO WE GET PEOPLE OUT OF LINE AT THE DMV AND GET A MONO. USING SOFTWARE USING INTERACTIVE METHOD SO THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO SIT ONLINE AT DMV AND HAVE ABOUT CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE. ULTIMATELY EVERY TRANSACTION WE GET OUT OF LINE A DMV FIELD OFFICE AND WE GET ONLINE WE'RE SAVING THE STATE ABOUT TWELVE DOLLARS MAYBE MORE FOR EVERYONE OF THOSE TRANSACTIONS. THERE IS A SYSTEM THAT'S SET UP TODAY THEY IS WORKING PROPERLY AND THE SYSTEM THAT SET UP TODAY IS. WE ARE ALLOWED AS AS FINANCES NOTED. TO ASSESS A TWENTY FIVE DOLLAR FEE THAT WE COLLECT FOR OUR SERVICES THE COST OF OUR SERVICES WHICH INCLUDES. I'M NOT ONLY THE SOFTWARE COMPONENT BUT MAILING OUT LICENSE PLATES PROCESSING STICKERS MILLION THE STICKERS OUT STICKERS OUT EVERYTHING WE DO ON BEHALF OF THE CUSTOMER. WE CHARGE A TWENTY FIVE DOLLAR FEE THAT FEE HAS BEEN TAPPED. BY THE DMV FOR YEARS. THAT HE'S NOT BEING RAISED. SEPARATE FROM THAT THERE'S A FOUR DOLLAR FEE THAT WE COLLECT TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE STATE. WE REMITTANCE STATE TODAY. SO THE PROPOSAL BEFORE YOU IN THIS BUDGET TRAILER BILL WENT OUT AN EXTRA DOLLAR. ONTO THIS THE PART OF THE STATE COLLECTS. PROBLEM WITH IT IS IT DOESN'T ALLOW US TO PASS IT THROUGH. THAT'S A FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE FOR US WE ESSENTIALLY ARE HAVING TO PAY THIS EXTRA DOLLAR OUT OF OUR OWN POCKETS WE CAN'T. PASS IT THROUGH IN OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WHICH IS TYPICALLY HOW A FEE WOULD WORK HE WOULD PASS IT THROUGH AND PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. SO IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE IT DOES EXACTLY WHAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER OBERNOLTE TALK ABOUT IT AND SENATE THIS INCENTIVIZE US FROM DOING THESE PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS WITH THE DMV. ON IT IT IT'S GOING TO IMPACT SERVICE AND IT'S GOING TO IMPACT JOBS. IN OUR COMMUNITIES THIS IS THE TYPE OF THING WE THINK THERE'S AN EASY FIX. FOR WE THINK THERE'S A SOLUTION HERE. OUR TRIP THIS LIKE EVERY OTHER FEE WE HAVE WITH THE DMV THAT YOU'RE ALLOWED TO PASS THROUGH. WE THINK ACTUALLY THERE COULD BE A REGULATORY FIXED IN THIS. AND IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT NIGHT NEEDS TO BE INCLUDED AND THIS PARTICULAR LANGUAGE WE APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THERE'S JOHN MOTH ON BEHALF OF COMPUTERIZED VEHICLE REGISTRATION JUST ONE ECHO THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUE ON THIS ISSUE WE ARE ANOTHER CALIFORNIA BASED COMPANY WITH OFFICES IN ORIGIN SANTA ROSA. AND AND I I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THERE'S A CLEAR DISTINCTION HERE AS TO WHO THE BENEFICIARY IS OF THIS FEE. IT'S NOT US. THE BENEFICIARY OF THIS IS THE CAR DEALER AND THE CAR BUYER BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE TO GO TO THE DMV TO FILE THIS PAPERWORK. DMV PUTS TOGETHER ITS COMPUTER PROGRAMS WE PUT TOGETHER OUR COMPUTER PROGRAMS TO PROVIDE THE LINK BETWEEN THE DEALER AND THE DMV TO MAKE THAT TRACK TRANSACTION ELECTRONIC. SO THE DMV IS GOING TO UPGRADE ITS SYSTEM. VIA THIS ONE DOLLAR FEE THAT MEANS THERE IS AN ADDITIONAL COST TO US NOT JUST BECAUSE THE FEE BUT WE'VE GOT UPGRADE OUR COMPUTER SYSTEM AS WELL. SO THE ARGUE THAT WE ARE THE BENEFICIARY OF THIS ADDITIONAL DOLLAR IS NOT ACCURATE THE ULTIMATE BENEFICIARY HERE IS THE CONSUMER THEMSELVES GETTING OUT A LINE AT THE DMV. AND THE D. M. V. E. FOR YOU KNOW IT HELPING TO ADDRESS THOSE CONGESTION ISSUES IN THEIR OFFICE [inaudible] THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN MARGARET CAMPBELL ON BEHALF OF* AUTOMOTIVE WE HAVE ONE OF OUR MEMBER COMPANIES IS DEALER TRACK WHICH IS LOCATED IN RANCHO CORDOVA.

OKAY SEEN OTHER DISK WELL INTERIOR MOVE ON I S. B.. EIGHT FIFTY THE HOUSING TRAILER BILL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THIS TRAILER BILL MAKES TECHNICAL CLARIFICATIONS TO THE HOUSING STREAMLINING STATUTE ENACTED IN S. B. THIRTY FIVE LAST YEAR. SPECIFICALLY THIS TRAILER BILL CREATES THE HOMELESS EMERGENCY A BLOCK GRANT PROGRAM AND SPECIFIES HOW THE BUSINESS CONSUMER SERVICES AND HOUSING AGENCY WILL ADMINISTER THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME APPROPRIATION INCLUDED IN THE BUDGET.

THE TRAILER BILL ALSO MOVES THE HOMELESS COORDINATING AND FINANCING COUNSEL TO THE BUSINESS CONSUMER SERVICES AND HOUSING AGENCY. WITH THAT I'M HAPPY ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU BACK TO THE COMMITTEE IN THE COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS MS COMPANY ARE. SO I I THINK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT ARM. FOR THE RECITATION OF THE OF THE BIG BIG DOLLARS THE HARD PART FOR ME AND AND WITH A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME THAT WE'VE HAD TO KINDA LOOK AT THIS. IS TO FIGURE OUT FRANKLY WHETHER ANY MONEY IS GOING TO GO TO RURAL CALIFORNIA. BECAUSE A LOT OF IT IS WAITED VERY HEAVILY TOWARDS THE BIG CITIES [inaudible] SO -- AND IN THAT CONCERNS ME BECAUSE RURAL CALIFORNIA HAS. YEAH AS SIGNIFICANT A HOUSING PROBLEM AS THE BIG CITIES NUMBER ONE AND NUMBER TWO THE AGE TO PROGRAM AS COMMAND AND HAS REALLY DRIVEN FAMILIES OUT OF THAT THERE. THE HOUSING THAT THEY WOULD HAVE NORMALLY BEEN IN INTO SEVERELY OVERCROWDED HOUSING AND SO MANY OF THEM ARE NOW FINDING THEMSELVES OUT ON THE STREETS AS WELL AND SO ON I'M I'M REALLY CONCERNED I I I'M I'M HAPPY WITH HOW THIS IS BEEN ORGANIZED EXCEPT FOR THAT. THE THE WAY THAT IT'S BEEN ORGANIZED TO FOCUS ON HOMELESS POINT IN TIME COUNTS OF VERY HIGH NUMBERS I'M JUST NOT SURE THAT ANY OF THE MONEY'S GOING TO GET TO RECOVERING MAYBE CAN. ABSOLUTELY A KING THAT THAT'S A FAIR CONCERN I WOULD SAY THAT THERE ARE THREE DIFFERENT ALLOCATION METHODOLOGY IS INCLUDED IN THIS TRAILER BILL TO GET TO THAT CONCERN. SO THIS BUILDS UP THE ADMINISTRATION'S MAY REVISION PROPOSAL WHICH PROPOSED A BLENDED APPROACH IT LOOKS AT POINT IN TIME BUT IT ALSO CREATES BANDS. SO THAT THERE'S NOT HUGE CLIFFS IN THE GRANT AMOUNTS BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS WE DON'T ONLY USE POINT IN TIME COUNT. ON THE NEXT -- ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS RESPECTIVELY I'M ARE FOR CITIES ON AND THEY'RE DIRECTLY APPROPRIATES THE LARGEST CITIES BASED ON POPULATION AND AND THERE IS ONE POT THAT IS SPECIFICALLY BASED IN POINT IN TIME BUT BETWEEN THE TWO METHODOLOGIES THEY THINK THAT WE'VE STOCK WE'VE GOT GOOD. COVERAGE TO ADDRESS YOUR ISSUE I'D ALSO NOTE THAT THERE IS A WAIVER ALLOWED ON AND WE SPECIFICALLY INCLUDED IT FOR RULE COMMUNITIES. ON IN WHICH DECLARING A SHELTER EMERGENCY MAY NOT REALLY BE -- REASONABLE FOR THEM ALMOND. OAKLEY FOR RURAL AREAS OF THE CITY. OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. OKAY SEEING NONE I HAVE PUBLIC TESTIMONY SUPPORT. GEN FREER AND SUPPORT I HAVE THE TRAILER BILL AROUND HOUSING AND FOR YOUR INCLUSION AND ATTENTION TO YOUTH EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS AND SETTING A FLOOR OF AT LEAST 5% OF THE FUND'S BEEN DEDICATED TOWARDS A YEAR.

EIGHT FIVE TWO I THINK YOU MISTER CHAIR THIS BILL RATIFIES THE UNION CONTRACT BETWEEN THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE CALIFORNIA CORRECTIONAL PEACE OFFERS ASSOCIATION THE PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL DO NOT TAKE EFFECT UNLESS THE FUNDS ARE SPECIFICALLY APPROPRIATED BY THE LEGISLATURE. THE COLLECTIVELY BARGAINED CONTRACT WITH CCPOA RESULTS IN BUDGET YOUR COST TOTALING ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE MILLION. OF WHICH ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO MILLION OR GENERAL FUND FOR CCPOA MEMBERS AND RELATED EXCLUDED EMPLOYEES. THESE OUR INCLUDED AND THAT BUDGET ITEM. NINETY EIGHT HUNDRED THESE COSTS ARE THE RESULT OF PERMITTING CCPOA MEMBERS TO CASH OUT UP TO EIGHTY HOURS OF COMPENSABLE LEAVE PROVIDING THE LATEST EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTION FOR HEALTH CARE PREMIUM RATES. INCREASING THE ANNUAL UNIFORM ALLOWANCE AND INCREASING THE NIGHT SHIFT AND WE CAN PAY DIFFERENTIALS. WITH THE 5% GENERAL SALARY INCREASE BEGINNING AND TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TOTAL BUDGETARY COSTS OVER THE DURATION OF THE ONE YEAR CONTRACT WILL BE A PROPS APPROXIMATELY FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY THREE MILLION. OF WHICH FOUR HUNDRED FIFTEEN MILLION IS CHEN WE WOULD KNOW THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS SOUGHT SYSTEMIC IMPROVEMENTS LIKE INCREASING THE NUMBER OF CORRECTIONAL COUNSELORS. TO REDUCE CASELOADS OF THAT THEY COULD SPEND MORE TIME WITH INMATES. SEARCHING UP PRISONS TSA STYLE WHICH THE UNION DOES HAVE THE RIGHT TO BARGAIN ABOUT AND ALTHOUGH THESE ARE NOT CONTRACT SPECIFIC WE DO ACKNOWLEDGE THEM AS OUR PARTNERS. AND IT WILL BE DAY NOT US ALONE WHO WILL CREATE BETTER PATHWAYS FOR OFFENDERS TO GET OUT AND NOT COME BACK INTO OUR PRISON SYSTEM. WE WANT THE MOST PROFESSIONAL WORKFORCE WE CAN GET AND WE RECOGNIZE THE DIFFICULT AND OFTEN DANGEROUS JOBS THAT THIS BARGAINING UNIT DO [inaudible] THANK YOU ASTRONAUT. I'M A BIG SUPPORTER OF THE WORK THAT OUR CORRECTIONAL PEACE OFFICERS DO AND I VOTED FOR THESE ARE WILL USE IN THE PAST BUT I'M STRUGGLING WITH THIS. ONE THIS IS A ONE YEAR M. O. U. WITH A 5% PAY INCREASE. IN AN ERA WHEN INFLATION IS RUNNING UNDER 3% OF CALIFORNIA'S OR WERE INFLATION IT WERE INCREASING COMPENSATION BY ALMOST TWICE THE RATE OF INFLATION WAS THE JUSTIFICATION FOR THAT. ALL THE FOR AND I HAD TO OUR DIRECTOR OF KELLY DRIVE BUT I WOULD NOTE THAT IT IS IN LINE WITH SOME OF THE OTHER GS SIZE THAT WE'VE PROVIDED TO OTHER BARGAINING UNITS. NOTABLY BARGAINING UNIT TWO ATTORNEYS BARGAINING UNIT NINE ENGINEERS AND BARGAINING UNIT TEN SCIENTISTS THEY ALL RECEIVED CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS AS WELL. THANK YOU RICHARD YOU'LL HAVE DIRECTOR OF COLLEGE ARE -- WHAT WE BELIEVE THIS IS A FAIR CONTRACT THAT IF YOU LOOK AT PRIOR CONTRACTS WITH THIS UNION THEY -- YOU KNOW THEY THEY GOT A NET OF 5% OVER. THREE YEARS AND THE LAST CONTRACT SO IF YOU LOOK AT THE MAP RESPECTIVE THEY WERE TRAILING -- CPI THIS FAR AS THEIR SALARIES KEEPING UP WITH INFLATION SO WE THINK IN THE END. WE THINK THIS IS A FAIR CONTRACT WE THINK IT REFLECTS THE PARTIES THE GOVERNOR TO FOCUS ON REAL BILL REHABILITATIVE SERVICES. AND I HELPING INMATES GET OUT ONLY PRODUCTIVELY LIVES A RECOGNIZES THE CRITICAL WORK IN THE DANGEROUS ENVIRONMENT THAT ARE CRACKS OFFICERS FACE EVERYDAY PROTECTING. CALIFORNIANS AND ALSO THE INMATES IN THE CUSTODY WELL I OBVIOUSLY ALSO SUPPORT THAT WORK BUT I'M ALSO FOCUSED ON THE FACT THAT. THE COST OF INCARCERATING A PRISONER IN CALIFORNIA ARE THE HIGHEST IN THE COUNTRY AND THIS IS ONE OF THE REASONS AND THAT'S WHY I THINK IT'S JUST DIFFICULT TO JUSTIFY THAT SIZE OF A SALARY INCREASE.

YOU TO GET BACK TOGETHER YES -- SO JUST OF OF FROM A DRUM A GENERAL PUBLIC STAMP WHAT I I GUESS THAT WOULD BE THE REASON WHY I'M ASKING THIS I DON'T THINK THE GENERAL PUBLIC UNDERSTANDS THAT. IF WE DO HAVE ADDITIONAL SAVINGS THAT AS AS WE FILL THESE -- SAVINGS ACCOUNTS THAT THERE IS A TRIGGER MECHANISM THAT ALLOWS FOR THE MONEY TO GO BACK -- AND TO THE TO THE ECONOMY OR TO THE TO THE GENERAL POPULATION TO ASSAIL SEX REPRODUCTION IS THAT CORRECT. THAT'S CORRECT AND THE CONFERENCE BUDGET BEFORE YOU DOES NOT HAVE IT WOULD NOT TRIGGER THAT MECHANISM. AND IS THAT IT IN IS THAT BECAUSE WE CREATE A THIRD ACCOUNT. NO IT'S MORE BECAUSE OF THE EXPENDITURE PLAN. SO WHEN THAT WAS THERE A DISCUSSION THEN IN IN IN DETERMINING WHETHER TO CREATE ADDITIONAL COUNTS VERSUS JUST PUTTING ALL THE MONEY INTO. A EXISTING SAVINGS ACCOUNTS. BOTH OF THE RESERVE FUNDS BEFORE YOU WERE AND BROUGHT THE FORCES LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS SO THE SAFETY RESERVE ACCOUNT WITH US SENATE PROPOSAL. ON AND THE BUDGET DEFICIT SAVINGS ACCOUNT WASN'T ASSEMBLY PROPOSAL I THINK TO GO BACK TO MY COLLEAGUES FURTHER POINT. ON IT'S THE BALANCE IN THE SFE YOU THAT TRIGGERS THE SALES TAX ON BUT THERE'S A COUPLE THINGS HAPPENING HERE NOT THE LEAST OF WHICH IS THAT THE EXPENDITURE AMOUNT WOULDN'T ALLOW FOR THAT SUGAR TO BE REACHED IN THE ASSET FEE YOU BASED ON SPENDING THAT'S INCLUDED. AND GUN JUST AND WHAT IS THE TRICK WHAT WHAT WHAT POINT WITH THE TRIGGER OCCUR. OTHER SO THERE'S TWO DIFFERENT TRIGGERS THE FIRST IS IF THE BALANCE REACHES GREATER THAN 4% OF GENERAL FUND REVENUES IN BOTH THE PRIOR YEAR AND THE CURRENT YEAR. SO THAT WOULD BE SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN AND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN THEN THE SECOND TRIGGER IS IF THE BALANCE AND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN REACHES 3% OF GENERAL FUND REVENUES WHICH IS ABOUT FOUR POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS. AND ALSO THAT THE ADMINISTRATION'S OUT FORECAST FOR REVENUES INCREASES BETWEEN MAY THIRTIETH AND SEPTEMBER FIRST. I BELIEVE IT'S SEPTEMBER FIRST BUT IT'S MAY THIRTIETH AND ANOTHER POINT IN SEPTEMBER -- IN IN THE CURRENT YEAR. SO BOTH OF THOSE TRIGGERS WOULD HAVE THE CAR* FOR TAT FOR THOSE BONUS FOR TWO AT THE MET. SO WITHIN EACH OF THOSE TRIGGERS BOTH CRITERIA HAVE TO BE MAD RIGHT SO BUT BUT EITHER ONE COULD BE TRIGGERED SO FEW IN THE FIRST CASE HIT 4% IN BOTH SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND THAT ONE WHAT HAPPENED. AND IN THE SECOND CASE IF YOU HAD THAT SITUATION WHERE THE FORECAST INCREASES AND ALSO YOU HIT 3% AND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN THE NOT TRIGGER WHAT. TO WHAT WHAT THE LEVEL BE FOR THE FIRST PRETTY I POLICY YOU IS THAT I DON'T WANT FOUR POINT ONE BILLION. FOR GOD THIS IT'S IT'S ROUGHLY FOUR POINT WAS TO THE FOUR POINT ONE MILLION IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN IS. FOR THE SECOND TRIGGER THE 4% HIGHER IT'S IT'S ABOUT FIVE BILLION IN EACH YEAR ALTHOUGH I DON'T HAVE THAT NUMBER OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD BUT THAT ONE IS A LOT HIGHER SO THE STATE IS NOT REALLY AT RISK OF HITTING ON ONE OF THE ONE THAT MIGHT. BE YOU KNOW CLOSER TO OF ISSUE IS -- IS THE SECOND TRIGGER WITH A 3%. AND JUST MY LAST QUESTION IS WAS THERE EVER DISCUSSION OF USING MORE MONEY ABUSING IS THAT MORE PUTTING MORE THE MONEY INTO THE EXISTING TWO ACCOUNTS -- INSTEAD OF TREATING THE THIRD ACCOUNT. WE'VE REACH THE CONSTITUTIONAL TARGET AND THE PROP TO RESERVE AMOUNT CELL AND MORE AT THE HIGHEST THAT IT CAN GO SO WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU CONTINUE TO PUT IT. UP WELL ACTUALLY AND THERE'S ANOTHER ITEM THAT WILL GET TO UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF PROP TWO ONCE YOU REACH THE CONSTITUTIONAL TARGET OF 10%. ANYTHING ABOVE AND BEYOND THAT SPILLS OVER IT'S REQUIRED FOR INFRASTRUCTURE. SO IF WE HAD PUT MORE MONEY INTO THE PROP TWO ABOVE AND BEYOND THE MONEY WE COULD INFRASTRUCTURE. IT'S A LITTLE MORE COMPLICATED BUT IT'S EVIDENCE WHATSOEVER LET'S LET THE REQUIRED AMOUNT SO WE THE NEXT NEXT YEAR WHEN YOU. PUT ANOTHER WAY WHAT IT WOULD BE USED AFTER SESSION THE FOLLOWING YEAR CRACKS ABOUT IT IN IN NEXT YEAR'S BUDGET SINCE WE'RE PROPOSE THAT. SINCE WE BE AT 10% ANY ADDITIONAL REQUIRED CALCULATION FOR POP TO THE BALANCE YOU DON'T NEED 410% GOES TO INTEREST. OKAY SO SO I THINK WE'RE SAYING THE SAME THING IT DOES NOT INFRASTRUCTURE JUST DOESN'T GO THIS YEAR GOES NEXT YEAR GREAT THANK YOU. AND AND ALEJO DITTO IF YOU WANTED A OR COULD ANSWER MR FUNG'S FIRST QUESTION AROUND SOME OF THE HISTORY OF THE YES OF THE FIRST SALES TAX SUGAR WAS PASSED AS PART OF THE NINETEEN NINETY NINETY ONE ON BUDGET. AND THE SECOND ONE WAS PER THE TWO THOUSAND TWO THOUSAND ONE BUDGET -- IN THE NINETEEN NINETY NINETEEN NINETY ONE BUDGET -- THE FIRST SET SALES TAX SUGAR WAS PASSED COUPLED WITH A SALES TAX INCREASE OF THE EQUIVALENT ONE QUARTER CENT ON AND THEN IN THE TWO THOUSAND TWO THOUSAND ONE SPENDING PLAN ON THE IDEA WAS TO REDUCE THE THRESHOLD 23%. JUST ONE LAST QUESTION HAS A TRIGGER EVER BEEN PULLED YES WHAT'S WHEN WAS THAT. WHO -- EARLY TO MID TWO THOUSANDS ITEM OF THE DAY OFF. PICKY [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] MISTER BENNETT. SO OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE BEEN HAVING THIS DISCUSSION FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS NOW BUT ANOTHER QUESTION JUST A STATEMENT. AS FAR AS I CAN TELL THE ONLY REASON. TO CREATE NEW TYPES OF BUDGET SAID DEFICIT SAVINGS ACCOUNTS IS TO AVOID. LOWERING THE STATE SALES TAX RATE AND GIVING THE PEOPLE CALIFORNIA BREAK ON THEIR STATE SALES TAX.

THOSE ARE FUNDS AN INFRASTRUCTURE THERE WERE% PROBABLY THINKING ABOUT ROADS AND BRIDGES AND AQUEDUCTS AND DAMS AND THINGS LIKE THAT I DON'T THINK THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT [inaudible] STATE. BUILDINGS AND THAT'S WHAT THE MAJORITY OF THE MONEY IN THIS TRAILER BILL IS GOING TO WHAT I WAS THE JUSTIFICATION FOR PUTTING THAT MONEY. TO WARD STATE BUILDINGS AND NOT TOWARDS WHAT. THEY A MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC MIGHT CONSIDER INFRASTRUCTURE. PROP TO SPECIFICALLY REFERENCES UP GOVERNMENT CODE SECTION ON INFRASTRUCTURE EONS WE BELIEVE THAT STATE BUILDINGS ARE PERFECTLY PERMISSIBLE UNDER THAT CODE SECTION. I AGREE WITH YOU THAT IT'S PERMITTED I JUST THOUGHT THINKING THAT THE AVERAGE VOTER WHO VOTED FOR PROP TWO WAS THINKING ABOUT STATE BUILDINGS WHEN WE USE THE WORD INFRASTRUCTURE.
