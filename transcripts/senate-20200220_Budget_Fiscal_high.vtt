00:15:26.759 --> 00:15:28.460
SAME TIME I DO WANT TO STRESS

00:15:28.527 --> 00:15:30.029
THAT IT'S NOT A GUARANTEE. IS

00:15:30.095 --> 00:15:32.164
IF CURRENT POPULAR TRENDS HOLE

00:15:32.231 --> 00:15:34.233
AND FURTHERMORE IT'S IMPOSSIBLE

00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:38.804
TO SAY RIGHT NOW WHICH PRISON

00:15:38.871 --> 00:15:42.007
MIGHT BE SLATED FOR CLOSURE.

00:15:42.074 --> 00:15:47.880
THAT'S A FACTOR IS. COME ON

SEPTEMBER WITH THAT POP OR WE

00:15:56.922 --> 00:15:58.457
SEEING THE DECLINE AND THAT

00:15:58.524 --> 00:15:59.091
WILL ENABLE TO MAKE THOSE JUDGE

00:15:59.158 --> 00:16:01.427
AS THE YEARS GO ON SO- WHEN IT

00:16:01.493 --> 00:16:03.162
COMES THAT SPECIFICS OF THOSE

00:16:03.228 --> 00:16:05.030
POPULATION NUMBERS WHERE THEY

00:16:05.097 --> 00:16:06.031
HAD BEEN IN THE LAST COUPLE

00:16:06.098 --> 00:16:07.166
YEARS AND WHERE THEY'RE GOING

ERIN EDWARDS WITH THE

00:16:15.641 --> 00:16:16.542
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THE MAIN

00:16:16.608 --> 00:16:18.410
FOCUS OF MY PRESENTATION THIS

00:16:18.477 --> 00:16:19.478
MORNING IS GOING TO BE ON

00:16:19.545 --> 00:16:21.880
DESCRIBING WHAT WE EXPECT- IN

00:16:23.148 --> 00:16:24.616
OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS.

00:16:24.683 --> 00:16:26.485
AND HOW WE PLAN TO ADJUST OUR

00:16:26.552 --> 00:16:28.854
PRISON CAPACITY ACCORDINGLY-

00:16:28.921 --> 00:16:30.255
INCLUDING BY. MEETING THE

00:16:30.322 --> 00:16:31.724
GOVERNOR'S COMMITMENT TO REDUCE

00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:34.026
RELIANCE ON PRIVATE CONTRACT

00:16:34.093 --> 00:16:36.362
PADS HI AND CLOSING A STATE

00:16:36.428 --> 00:16:39.431
PRISON WAS AND- FIVE YEARS. NOW

00:16:39.498 --> 00:16:42.234
I THINK THE LA FOR OVER OF KIND

00:16:42.301 --> 00:16:43.869
OF WHERE WE'VE FROM IN THE LAST

00:16:43.936 --> 00:16:45.137
SEVERAL YEARS BUT I DO THINK

00:16:45.204 --> 00:16:47.639
IT'S IMPORTANT TO. HIGHLIGHT A

00:16:47.706 --> 00:16:49.708
COUPLE OF KEY POINTS THAT I

00:16:49.775 --> 00:16:51.410
THINK PROVIDE SOME IMPORTANT

00:16:51.477 --> 00:16:53.445
CONTACTS OF JUST HOW FAR WE'VE

00:16:53.512 --> 00:16:56.048
COME- IT WHEN WE WERE AT OUR

00:16:56.115 --> 00:16:58.751
PEAK. AT IN TWO THOUSAND SIX OF

00:16:58.817 --> 00:17:00.352
THE IN MAY PRISON POPULATION

00:17:00.419 --> 00:17:02.488
WE'RE HOUSING HUNDRED AND

00:17:02.554 --> 00:17:03.088
SEVENTY THREE THOUSAND INMATES

00:17:03.155 --> 00:17:05.758
AT THAT TIME. HI SOME AYE I

00:17:05.824 --> 00:17:06.925
KNOW SOME OF THE MEMBERS OF THE

00:17:06.992 --> 00:17:08.260
COMMITTEE HAVE HAVE BEEN AROUND

00:17:08.327 --> 00:17:09.194
LONG ENOUGH TO PROBABLY HAVE

00:17:09.261 --> 00:17:10.496
VISITED FIRST HAND AND

00:17:10.562 --> 00:17:12.164
UNDERSTAND EXACTLY WHAT THAT.

00:17:12.231 --> 00:17:14.266
LOOK LIKE AND WHAT THAT MEANT

00:17:14.333 --> 00:17:16.668
FOR OUR PRISON OPERATIONS-

00:17:16.735 --> 00:17:17.736
OTHERS ARE YOU HAVE PROBABLY

00:17:17.803 --> 00:17:20.272
SEEN THE PICTURES OF INMATES

00:17:20.339 --> 00:17:22.074
HOUSED IN TROUBLE BELONGS IN

00:17:22.141 --> 00:17:24.676
AND GYMNASIUMS IN OUR- STATE

00:17:24.743 --> 00:17:27.045
INSTITUTIONS- I THINK THAT'S A

00:17:27.112 --> 00:17:28.313
RATHER DRAMATIC VISUAL

00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:30.048
REPRESENTATION OF JUST HOW

00:17:30.115 --> 00:17:32.084
OVERCROWDED. OUR INSTITUTIONS

00:17:32.151 --> 00:17:34.586
WERE. WHAT'S MAYBE NOT CONVEYED

00:17:34.653 --> 00:17:36.155
IN THOSE PICTURES IS WHAT THE

00:17:36.221 --> 00:17:38.123
IMPACT WAS FOR THE APARTMENTS

00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:41.193
OPERATIONS. I THINK MANAGING A

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:42.528
PRISON SYSTEM THAT THAT THAT IS

00:17:42.594 --> 00:17:44.897
THAT THAT OVERCROWDED- IT

00:17:44.963 --> 00:17:46.098
REQUIRES SO MUCH OF THE

00:17:46.165 --> 00:17:47.366
DEPARTMENT'S ATTENTION JUST TO

00:17:47.433 --> 00:17:49.501
MAKE SURE THAT THE- PRISONS ARE

00:17:49.568 --> 00:17:52.438

CONSTITUTIONAL LEVELS OF HEALTH

00:17:57.543 --> 00:18:00.446
CARE HI AND FOCUSING ON IN MAY

00:18:00.512 --> 00:18:02.481
REHABILITATION- SO NOW

00:18:02.548 --> 00:18:04.016

THOUSAND AND MEN'S- IN OUR

00:18:10.622 --> 00:18:11.857
STATE PRISONS. SO THAT'S A

00:18:11.924 --> 00:18:13.325
DECLINE OF FIFTY THOUSAND

00:18:13.392 --> 00:18:15.561
INMATES IN THE LAST. FOURTEEN

00:18:15.627 --> 00:18:18.497
YEARS OR ALMOST 30% AND WHAT

THE DEPARTMENT TO REFOCUS ON

00:18:21.867 --> 00:18:24.069

SENTENCES. IN A IN ADDITION

00:18:35.848 --> 00:18:37.182
IT'S ALSO ALLOWED US TO REDUCE

00:18:37.249 --> 00:18:39.952
OUR RELIANCE ON COSTS THE

00:18:40.018 --> 00:18:42.354
CONTRACT CAPACITY. AT ITS PEAK

TWENTY NINETEEN. SO THAT BRINGS

00:19:32.104 --> 00:19:33.705
US KIND OF WHERE WE STAND TODAY

00:19:33.772 --> 00:19:35.807
RIGHT NOW WE HAVE SIX REMAINING

00:19:35.874 --> 00:19:37.142
CONTRACTS FACILITIES THAT

FACILITIES. AND AS I SAIDTHE

00:19:53.292 --> 00:19:54.126
CURRENT POPULATION WITHIN ALL

OF THOSE- FACILITIES IS A TOTAL

00:19:57.229 --> 00:19:57.696
OF JUST OVER TWENTY THREE

00:19:57.763 --> 00:20:00.332
HUNDRED RIGHT NOW. TO NOW-

00:20:00.399 --> 00:20:02.167
TURNING TO WHERE WE EXPECT TO

00:20:02.234 --> 00:20:03.769
BE OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS

00:20:03.835 --> 00:20:05.203
WHICH IS I THINK REALLY THE

00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:07.673
MAIN FOCUS OF THIS CONVERSATION

00:20:07.739 --> 00:20:09.942
TODAY- THAT PREPARED A- VISUAL

00:20:10.008 --> 00:20:12.210
AID TO. TO HELP YOU FALL ALONG

00:20:12.277 --> 00:20:14.913
WITH MY COMMENTS. IT LOOKS LIKE

00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:16.448
THIS SHOULD BE IN FRONT OF YOU

00:20:16.515 --> 00:20:17.816
WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT HERE IS

00:20:17.883 --> 00:20:19.585
REALLY- HIGH LEVEL PLANNING

00:20:19.651 --> 00:20:21.820
DOCUMENT- THAT WE USE TO HELP

00:20:21.887 --> 00:20:23.422
US MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE

00:20:23.488 --> 00:20:25.223
ENOUGH PRISON CAPACITY. TO

00:20:25.290 --> 00:20:26.558
MANAGE ALL OF THE INMATES IN

00:20:26.625 --> 00:20:29.828
OUR CARE. SO IF YOU LOOK AT THE

00:20:29.895 --> 00:20:31.930
TOP LINE WHICH IS LABELED

00:20:31.997 --> 00:20:34.800
PROJECTED INMATE POPULATION-

00:20:34.866 --> 00:20:37.035
THAT IS SHOWING WHAT WE EXPECT

00:20:37.102 --> 00:20:38.604
THE POPULATION TO BE OVER THE

00:20:38.670 --> 00:20:40.672
LAST SEVERAL YEARS. AND AS YOU

00:20:40.739 --> 00:20:41.940
CAN SEE WHERE PROJECT IN

00:20:42.007 --> 00:20:44.443
DECLINE OF SEVERAL THOUSAND

00:20:44.509 --> 00:20:44.977
INMATES OVER THIS FORECAST

00:20:45.043 --> 00:20:48.747
PERIOD. THE NEXT LINE DOWN

00:20:48.814 --> 00:20:50.549
SHOWS WHAT THE COURT ORDER

00:20:50.616 --> 00:20:53.352
POPULATION CAP IS AT ONE

00:20:53.418 --> 00:20:54.119
HUNDRED THIRTY SEVEN POINT 5%

00:20:54.186 --> 00:20:56.421
OF DESIGN CAPACITY. AS ELLIE-

00:20:56.488 --> 00:20:58.190
NOTED THAT EQUATES TO JUST

00:20:58.256 --> 00:21:00.459
UNDER ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTEEN

00:21:00.525 --> 00:21:01.226
THOUSAND INMATES THAT WE ARE

00:21:01.293 --> 00:21:02.728
ABLE TO HOUSE IN OUR THIRTY

00:21:02.794 --> 00:21:08.100
FOUR- STATE OPERATED PRISONS.

00:21:08.166 --> 00:21:12.237
THE FOLLOWING IS. SERIES ROE IS

00:21:12.304 --> 00:21:14.573
ADJUSTMENTS THAT WE MAKE TO

00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:16.308
THAT TOP WINE TO REFLECT

00:21:16.375 --> 00:21:18.543
INMATES WERE HOUSE OUTSIDE OF

00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:20.579
OUR THIRTY FOUR STATE PRISONS

00:21:20.646 --> 00:21:21.847
BECAUSE THOSE INMATES DO NOT

00:21:21.913 --> 00:21:23.615
COUNT TOWARDS THE STATE-

00:21:23.682 --> 00:21:26.318
POPULATIONS POPULATION CAP. SO

00:21:26.385 --> 00:21:28.353
ESSENTIALLY WE NEED TO SUBTRACT

00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:30.555
THEM FROM THAT TOP LINE. SO

00:21:30.622 --> 00:21:31.657
THIS INCLUDES INMATES HELD IN

00:21:31.723 --> 00:21:33.392
THE PRIVATE- AND PUBLIC

00:21:33.458 --> 00:21:35.727
CONTRACT FACILITIES. AS WELL AS

00:21:35.794 --> 00:21:37.229
INMATES THAT WE HOUSE IN OUR

00:21:37.295 --> 00:21:38.864
STATE FIRE CANS THAT ASSISTS

00:21:38.930 --> 00:21:41.199
OUT CAL FIRE AND FIGHTING FIRES

00:21:41.266 --> 00:21:43.969
ACROSS THE STATE- AS WELL. A AT

00:21:44.036 --> 00:21:45.470
LEAST FACILITY THAT WE HAVE IN

00:21:45.537 --> 00:21:47.472
CALIFORNIA CITY WHICH IS-

00:21:47.539 --> 00:21:49.474
ACTUALLY STAFFED BY CDC OUR

00:21:49.541 --> 00:21:52.978
STAFF BUT- BUT LEASE FROM A

00:21:53.045 --> 00:21:57.883
PRIVATE COMPANY. SO I TURN TO

00:21:57.949 --> 00:22:00.018
AT THE BY LINE HERE BUT A- AND

00:22:00.085 --> 00:22:03.055
LITERALLY- ON THIS CHART- THIS

00:22:03.121 --> 00:22:04.756
SHOWS WHAT THE DIFFERENCE IS

00:22:04.823 --> 00:22:07.659
BETWEEN THE- PROJECTED INMATE

00:22:07.726 --> 00:22:11.430
POPULATION- HOUSE IN OUR THIRTY

00:22:11.496 --> 00:22:13.699
FOUR PRISONS AND WHAT THE

00:22:13.765 --> 00:22:17.369
POPULATION CAP IS- IT WE OFTEN

00:22:17.436 --> 00:22:18.670
REFER TO THIS AS OUR BALL FOR.

00:22:18.737 --> 00:22:22.708
SO FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU LOOK AT

00:22:22.774 --> 00:22:23.275
TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY

00:22:23.341 --> 00:22:24.576
WEEKS WE ARE TWENTY THREE

00:22:24.643 --> 00:22:25.944
ALMOST TWENTY THREE HUNDRED

00:22:26.011 --> 00:22:27.145
INMATES BELOW THE POPULATION

00:22:27.212 --> 00:22:30.549
CAP- AND THAT MEANS TECHNICALLY

00:22:30.615 --> 00:22:32.517
WE COULD ADD ANOTHER TWENTY

00:22:32.584 --> 00:22:37.055
THREE HUNDRED INMATES TO OUR

00:22:37.122 --> 00:22:37.622
EXCEEDING THAT THAT FEDERAL

00:22:37.689 --> 00:22:39.758
COURT ORDER. IN THIS IS REALLY

00:22:39.825 --> 00:22:41.026
THE KEY VARIABLE THAT WERE

00:22:41.093 --> 00:22:44.296
MANAGING TO AS WE ADJUST PRISON

00:22:44.362 --> 00:22:47.933
CAPACITY- FOR CHANGES IN THE

00:22:47.999 --> 00:22:50.702
OVERALL PRISON POPULATION. SO

00:22:50.769 --> 00:22:53.572
THE KEY HERE IS REALLY

00:22:53.638 --> 00:22:55.874
MAINTAINING- THE RIGHT LEVEL OF

00:22:55.941 --> 00:22:57.642
OFFER AND NOT HAVING IT BE TOO

00:22:57.709 --> 00:23:00.312
HIGH OR TOO LOW- THE REASON WE

00:23:00.378 --> 00:23:02.614
DON'T WANT IT TO BE TOO LOW IS

00:23:02.681 --> 00:23:04.783
BECAUSE THAT WE COULD RISK

00:23:04.850 --> 00:23:07.285
VIOLATING THE COURT ORDER-

00:23:07.352 --> 00:23:07.919
THERE'S SOME LEVEL OF

00:23:07.986 --> 00:23:09.888
UNCERTAINTY AND WHAT OUR PRISON

00:23:09.955 --> 00:23:12.057
POPULATION WILL BE WE DO

00:23:12.124 --> 00:23:13.992
PROJECTIONS IN THOSE- TEND TO

00:23:14.059 --> 00:23:16.728
BE FAIRLY ACCURATE BUT- IT.

00:23:16.795 --> 00:23:18.263
IT'S COMPLICATED BECAUSE WE

00:23:18.330 --> 00:23:19.831
REALLY HAVE NO CONTROL OVER WHO

00:23:19.898 --> 00:23:21.032
COMES IN THE FRONT DOOR OF THE

00:23:21.099 --> 00:23:24.569
PRISONS THAT IS THAT- THAT THAT

00:23:24.636 --> 00:23:26.204
IS BASICALLY DEPENDING ON WHO

00:23:26.271 --> 00:23:27.506
THE COUNTY SEND US WE DON'T

00:23:27.572 --> 00:23:30.008
HAVE A CHOICE TO TURN THEM AWAY

00:23:30.075 --> 00:23:32.644
AT THE FRONT DOOR AND SO- EVEN

00:23:32.711 --> 00:23:33.779
SMALL CHANGES IN COUNTY

00:23:33.845 --> 00:23:36.481
SENTENCING PRACTICES- SLIDE

00:23:36.548 --> 00:23:38.984
INTO A IN IT UP TAKEN CRIME

00:23:39.050 --> 00:23:41.553
RATES OR- AND NOT. JUST POLICY

00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:43.822
IS THE FROM WHAT D. A.'S COULD

00:23:43.889 --> 00:23:45.323
RESULT IN IN MANSON WE EXPECT

00:23:45.390 --> 00:23:48.026
COMING TO STATE PRISON IN THAT

00:23:48.093 --> 00:23:49.327
WOULD POTENTIALLY JEOPARDIZE

00:23:49.394 --> 00:23:51.930
OUR ABILITY TO MEET THE FEDERAL

00:23:51.997 --> 00:23:53.832
COURT POPULATION CAP I'M WHICH

00:23:53.899 --> 00:23:54.866
CASE THE FEDERAL COURTS WOULD

00:23:54.933 --> 00:23:56.301
HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO JUST

00:23:56.368 --> 00:23:57.602
START RELEASING IN MEN'S FROM

00:23:57.669 --> 00:23:59.304
OUR PRESENT. NOW OBVIOUSLY

00:23:59.371 --> 00:24:00.772
THAT'S SOMETHING WE TAKE VERY

00:24:00.839 --> 00:24:01.807
SERIOUSLY FROM A PUBLIC SAFETY

00:24:01.873 --> 00:24:03.742
STANDPOINT WILL DO EVERYTHING

00:24:03.809 --> 00:24:05.477
IN OUR POWER TO AVOID THAT- AND

00:24:05.544 --> 00:24:07.045
THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO MAINTAIN

00:24:07.112 --> 00:24:08.780
THAT BUMPER TO ACCOUNT FOR A

00:24:08.847 --> 00:24:15.453
SORT OF. THE NEXT INCREASE. IN

00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:18.456
SAN. TO STATE PRESS. ON THE

00:24:18.523 --> 00:24:19.057
OTHER HAND WE DON'T WANT THAT

00:24:19.124 --> 00:24:21.126
BY TO BE HIGH IN THE REASON

00:24:21.193 --> 00:24:22.394
BECAUSE WHEN INCREASE THAT BALL

00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:24.029
FOR THE WAY WE DO THAT IS BY

00:24:24.095 --> 00:24:25.497
GENERALLY GOING OUT AND

00:24:25.564 --> 00:24:26.898
PURCHASING MORE CONTRACT

00:24:26.965 --> 00:24:28.800
BALANCE IN THOSE BEDS COME IN A

00:24:28.867 --> 00:24:30.268
SIGNIFICANT COST OF THE STATE'S

00:24:30.335 --> 00:24:32.037
ABOUT THIRTY SEVEN THOUSAND

00:24:32.103 --> 00:24:33.972
DOLLARS PER BAD AND SO FOR

00:24:34.039 --> 00:24:36.541
EVERY AN INCREASE OF ONE HI.

00:24:36.608 --> 00:24:37.876
DAD IN THE BUFFER WE'RE

00:24:37.943 --> 00:24:39.878
ESSENTIALLY SPEND THIRTY SEVEN

00:24:39.945 --> 00:24:41.980
THOUSAND DOLLARS- AND SO WE

00:24:42.047 --> 00:24:44.983
WANT TO HONE IN ON A BOAT FOR A

00:24:45.050 --> 00:24:48.153
LEVEL THAT'S NOT TOO LOW AS TO

00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:50.088
RAISE OUR RISK OF EXCEEDING THE

00:24:50.155 --> 00:24:51.890
FEDERAL COURT POPULATION HAPPEN

00:24:51.957 --> 00:24:54.893
NOT TO HIGHEST SPEC FUNDING AND

00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:59.130
SISTERLY. SO THERE'S NO MAGIC

00:24:59.197 --> 00:25:00.332
NOW BUT WILL GENERAL SHOULD

00:25:00.398 --> 00:25:02.334
FOR. IS ABOUT BUFFER TWO

00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:03.702
THOUSAND IT'S BASED ON OUR

00:25:03.768 --> 00:25:06.071
ANALYSIS OF THE- OF CDC OURS

00:25:06.137 --> 00:25:07.873
POPULATION PROJECTIONS IN THE

00:25:07.939 --> 00:25:10.542
PAST- IN OUR EXPERIENCE IN THAT

00:25:10.609 --> 00:25:12.611
AREA- WE HAVE A COMFORT LEVEL

00:25:12.677 --> 00:25:14.246
THAT THAT WOULD. THAT WILL

00:25:14.312 --> 00:25:16.414
ALLOW US TO ACCOMMODATE ANY

00:25:16.481 --> 00:25:18.116
UNEXPECTED INCREASES IN THE

00:25:18.183 --> 00:25:21.820
POPULATION BUT BUT I ALSO- MAKE

00:25:21.887 --> 00:25:23.421
SURE THAT WERE. EXPENDING STATE

00:25:23.488 --> 00:25:26.191
FUNDS WISELY AND NOT SPENDING

00:25:26.258 --> 00:25:28.693
MONEY UNNECESSARILY SO IF

00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:31.496
YOU'LL TURN TO THE HAND OUT YOU

00:25:31.563 --> 00:25:33.098
CAN SEE THAT OUR POPULATION

00:25:33.164 --> 00:25:35.834
BUFFER- OVER THE NEXT FEW

00:25:35.901 --> 00:25:38.503
YEARS. IS PRETTY CONSISTENTLY

00:25:38.570 --> 00:25:40.672
RIGHT AROUND THAT TWO THOUSAND

00:25:40.739 --> 00:25:42.274
FIVE MARCH THAT WE SHOOT FOR

00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:43.675
THE REASON IS BECAUSE THE

00:25:43.742 --> 00:25:45.577
POPULATION IS DECLINING. BUT AT

00:25:45.644 --> 00:25:47.646
THE SAME TIME WE ARE PLANNING

00:25:47.712 --> 00:25:50.215
TO REDUCE OUR USE OF CONTRACT

00:25:50.282 --> 00:25:52.384
PADS IN SO THOSE TWO THINGS

00:25:52.450 --> 00:25:55.387
SORT OF OFFSET EACH OTHER OVER

00:25:55.453 --> 00:25:56.454
THE NEXT FEW YEARS. WE ARE

00:25:56.521 --> 00:25:58.189
PLANNING TO PROVIDE A LITTLE

00:25:58.256 --> 00:25:59.624
BIT MORE DETAIL THERE WE ARE

00:25:59.691 --> 00:26:02.894
PLANNING TO- OF AND THE USE OF

00:26:02.961 --> 00:26:05.330
BOTH OF OUR REMAINING PRIVATE

00:26:05.397 --> 00:26:07.098
CONTRACT BUT FACILITIES FOR

00:26:07.165 --> 00:26:09.367
MALE INMATES. ONE OF WHICH WE

00:26:09.434 --> 00:26:11.636
EXPECT TO BE PHASED OUT BY THE

00:26:11.703 --> 00:26:14.673
END OF THIS MONTH- THE SECOND

00:26:14.739 --> 00:26:16.408
AND FINAL REMAINING BY PRIVATE

00:26:16.474 --> 00:26:18.543
CONTRACT. FACILITY FOR MALES

00:26:18.610 --> 00:26:20.278
WILL BE PHASED OUT BY THE END

00:26:20.345 --> 00:26:22.580
OF APRIL OF TWENTY TWENTY SO

00:26:22.647 --> 00:26:24.149
JUST IN A COUPLE MONTHS FROM

00:26:24.215 --> 00:26:26.918
NOW IN THEN LOOKING FOR. INTO

00:26:26.985 --> 00:26:29.454
THE BUDGET. WE EXPECT TO BE

00:26:29.521 --> 00:26:31.523
ABLE TO PHASE OUT THE USE OF

00:26:31.589 --> 00:26:33.091
TWO OF OUR REMAINING PUBLIC

00:26:33.158 --> 00:26:35.193
CONTRACT FACILITIES FOR MALES

00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:36.761
WITHIN THE BUDGET YEAR. AND

00:26:36.828 --> 00:26:38.263
THEN THE FINAL PUBLIC CONTRACT

00:26:38.330 --> 00:26:39.898
FACILITY FROM MALES WE EXPECT

00:26:39.965 --> 00:26:42.200
TO BE ABLE TO PHASE OUT. BY

00:26:42.267 --> 00:26:45.303
JULY OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO. SO

00:26:45.370 --> 00:26:47.906
WE'RE ON PACE TO. VIRTUALLY

00:26:47.973 --> 00:26:49.240
ELIMINATE OUR USE OF CONTRACT

00:26:49.307 --> 00:26:50.375
PADS OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF

00:26:50.442 --> 00:26:55.513
YEARS THE IF YOU LOOK AT THE OF

00:26:55.580 --> 00:26:57.315
THE BALL FOR GOING OUT ON THE

00:26:57.382 --> 00:26:59.284
ON A LONGER TIME HORIZON YOU

00:26:59.351 --> 00:27:01.019
CAN SEE THAT IT STARTS TO GROW

00:27:01.086 --> 00:27:03.855
AND TWENTY TWENTY TWO TWENTY

00:27:03.922 --> 00:27:05.623
THREE. AND BY THE END OF OUR

00:27:05.690 --> 00:27:09.027
FORECAST PERIOD IN TWENTY THREE

00:27:09.094 --> 00:27:10.862
TWENTY FOUR I REACHES ABOUT

00:27:10.929 --> 00:27:12.831
FIFTY FIVE HUNDRED- SO THAT'S

00:27:12.897 --> 00:27:14.299
WHERE WE GET TO THE POINT HERE

00:27:14.366 --> 00:27:16.334
WE CAN ACTUALLY CONSIDER-

00:27:16.401 --> 00:27:18.570
CLOSING A STATE OPERATED

00:27:18.636 --> 00:27:21.406
FACILITY- WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IS

00:27:21.473 --> 00:27:24.242
WE WOULD HAVE TO- WE WOULD LOSE

00:27:24.309 --> 00:27:28.046
CAPACITY SO THE- THE- COURT

00:27:28.113 --> 00:27:28.947
ORDER POPULATION CAP WOULD

00:27:29.014 --> 00:27:32.317
DECLINE IT'S FOR THE AMOUNT OF

00:27:32.384 --> 00:27:33.785
THAT DECLINE WOULD DEPEND ON

00:27:33.852 --> 00:27:36.187
THE SIZE OF THE PRISON. WE

00:27:36.254 --> 00:27:37.822
DECIDE TO CLUBS- AVERAGE

00:27:37.889 --> 00:27:40.191
INSTITUTION SIZE IS ABOUT

00:27:40.258 --> 00:27:41.359
TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED INMATES AND

00:27:41.426 --> 00:27:42.761
OUT A HUNDRED AND THIRTY SEVEN

00:27:42.827 --> 00:27:45.030
POINT 5% OF DESIGN CAPACITY

00:27:45.096 --> 00:27:47.932
THAT EQUATES TO ROUGHLY THIRTY

00:27:47.999 --> 00:27:50.035
FIVE A LOT OF ROUGHLY THIRTY

00:27:50.101 --> 00:27:53.705
FIVE HUNDRED BEDS- TOWARDS OUR

00:27:53.772 --> 00:27:57.675
POPULATION CAP SO. YOU DO THE

00:27:57.742 --> 00:28:00.311
KIND BACK ON THE LOOKED OUT.

00:28:00.378 --> 00:28:01.112
SUBTRACTING THAT THIRTY FIVE ON

00:28:01.179 --> 00:28:02.814
FROM THE FIVE HUNDRED. WE WOULD

00:28:02.881 --> 00:28:04.449
BASICALLY ABLE TO THIS PRISON

00:28:04.516 --> 00:28:06.584
STILL MAY. THAT BUFFER OF TWO.

00:28:06.651 --> 00:28:08.019
WHICH IS OUR COMFORT LEVEL THAT

00:28:08.086 --> 00:28:10.155
WE WOULDN'T BE A- AND RISK OF

00:28:10.221 --> 00:28:13.892
VIOLATING THAT- FEDERAL COURT

00:28:13.958 --> 00:28:18.897
POPULATION CAP. THIS SO THINK

00:28:18.963 --> 00:28:20.065
THAT HOPEFULLY GIVES YOU A PER

00:28:20.131 --> 00:28:23.968
HIGH SUMMARY OF HOW WE APPROACH

00:28:24.035 --> 00:28:24.769
ADJUSTING OUR PRISON

00:28:24.836 --> 00:28:27.105
POPULATION- I DO WANT TO

00:28:27.172 --> 00:28:28.640
CONCLUDE MY REMARKS WITH JUST

00:28:28.706 --> 00:28:30.308
PROVIDING A- TO KIND OF

00:28:30.375 --> 00:28:31.643
IMPORTANT COPY OUT STYLE OF

00:28:31.709 --> 00:28:33.745
THIS DISCUSSION- THE FIRST

00:28:33.812 --> 00:28:35.046
BEING THAT THESE POPULATION

00:28:35.113 --> 00:28:37.449
PROJECTIONS ARE- AS MY

00:28:37.515 --> 00:28:38.716
COLLEAGUE NOTED SUBJECT TO THAT

00:28:38.783 --> 00:28:41.252
SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY- IN THE

00:28:41.319 --> 00:28:42.087
PAST WE FOUND THAT THE

00:28:42.153 --> 00:28:43.755
DEPARTMENT ACTUALLY DOES QUITE

00:28:43.822 --> 00:28:45.490
A GOOD JOB OF PROJECTING THE

00:28:45.557 --> 00:28:47.859
POPULATION- WHEN THERE ARE NO

00:28:47.926 --> 00:28:49.727
MAJOR POLICY CHANGES IN OTHER

00:28:49.794 --> 00:28:50.929
WORDS IF WE'RE JUST LOOK AT THE

00:28:50.995 --> 00:28:52.797
STATUS QUO THE DEPARTMENT IS

00:28:52.864 --> 00:28:54.132
QUITE ACCURATE ESTIMATE HOW

00:28:54.199 --> 00:28:56.034
MANY. INMATES WILL HAVE IN THE

00:28:56.101 --> 00:29:00.004
IN THE LAST FEW YEARS BUT THE-

00:29:00.071 --> 00:29:00.572
OF COURSE DOESN'T HAVE A PER

00:29:00.638 --> 00:29:02.707
BALL. IN IN WALL DOES NOT KNOW

00:29:02.774 --> 00:29:04.409
WHAT POLICY MIGHT BE COMING

00:29:04.476 --> 00:29:07.011
DOWN THE PIPELINE- FOR EXAMPLE

00:29:07.078 --> 00:29:08.413
THERE WILL BE AN INITIATIVE ON

00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:10.582
THE- AND THAT'S QUALIFIED FOR

00:29:10.648 --> 00:29:11.749
THE TWENTY TWENTY DOLLARS-

00:29:11.816 --> 00:29:13.518
WHICH WOULD GENERALLY- INCREASE

00:29:13.585 --> 00:29:16.754
THE PRISON POPULATION. AND IT.

00:29:16.821 --> 00:29:19.424
IF THE VOTERS APPROVE THAT THAT

00:29:19.491 --> 00:29:20.925
WOULD CERTAINLY. CAUSE US TO

00:29:20.992 --> 00:29:23.495
REVISIT ALL OF THIS- PURGE ALL

00:29:23.561 --> 00:29:25.797
OF THESE PROJECTIONS AND- OUR

00:29:25.864 --> 00:29:29.200
ESTIMATES OF WHAT WE EXPECT TO

00:29:29.267 --> 00:29:29.734
BE ABLE TO DO IN TERMS OF

00:29:29.801 --> 00:29:32.570
ADJUSTING TO. PRISON POPULATION

00:29:32.637 --> 00:29:34.005
CAPACITY- AND THEN THE FINAL

00:29:34.072 --> 00:29:40.211
COPY OUT I WOULD. HI IS JUST

00:29:40.278 --> 00:29:41.212
THIS IS FOR A SO HIGH ALLOWED

00:29:41.279 --> 00:29:43.815
TEND TO FOOT SUMMARY OF HOW WE

00:29:43.882 --> 00:29:45.650
MANAGE OUR PRISON POPULATION.

00:29:45.717 --> 00:29:47.952
IN THERE REALLY MASKS A LOT OF

00:29:48.019 --> 00:29:49.354
COMPLEXITY UNDERLYING ALL OF

00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:52.724
THIS- I THINK. IT'S IMPORTANT

00:29:52.790 --> 00:29:53.892
TO NOTE THAT THE DEPARTMENT

00:29:53.958 --> 00:29:54.959
ACTUALLY HAS TO MANAGE TO

00:29:55.026 --> 00:29:56.594
DOZENS OF VARIABLES WHEN THEY

00:29:56.661 --> 00:29:58.530
FIGURE OUT WHAT. WHAT TYPES OF

00:29:58.596 --> 00:30:00.498
BEDS THAT WE NEED TO HAVE IN

00:30:00.565 --> 00:30:02.267
OUR SYSTEM WE HAVE A SPECIAL

00:30:02.333 --> 00:30:03.735
TYPES OF BEDS FOR INMATES WITH

00:30:03.801 --> 00:30:05.336
MEDICAL NEEDS. WE HAVE SPECIAL

00:30:05.403 --> 00:30:06.437
BEDS FOR INMATES WITH MENTAL

00:30:06.504 --> 00:30:08.206
HEALTH NEEDS WE HAVE. BOB

00:30:08.273 --> 00:30:09.440
THAT'S FOR FOUR DIFFERENT TYPES

00:30:09.507 --> 00:30:10.875
OF SECURE FOR DIFFERENT LEVELS

00:30:10.942 --> 00:30:13.645
OF SECURITY- WE CAN'T HOUSE

00:30:13.711 --> 00:30:14.512
CERTAIN INMATES IN CERTAIN

00:30:14.579 --> 00:30:16.247
PRISONS BECAUSE THE REST OF

00:33:26.671 --> 00:33:27.138

00:33:49.861 --> 00:33:51.496
NEED WHAT THAT DOES IT CHANGES

00:33:51.562 --> 00:33:53.164
THE EMPLOYEES PURPOSE AND WHY

00:33:53.231 --> 00:33:54.499
THEY CHOSE TO WORK IN THE

00:33:54.565 --> 00:33:56.000
DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS.

00:33:56.067 --> 00:33:57.101
WORKING IN THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:33:57.168 --> 00:33:58.536
CORRECTIONS IS NOT AN EASY

00:33:58.603 --> 00:34:00.438
TASK. IT'S CHANGED OVER THE

00:34:00.505 --> 00:34:02.907
YEARS THE DEMANDS THE PRESSURES

00:34:02.974 --> 00:34:04.208
NOT ONLY FOR THEM PERSONALLY

00:34:04.275 --> 00:34:06.244
BUT THEIR FAMILIES. AND WHAT I

00:34:06.310 --> 00:34:07.845
CAN SAY IS THAT THERE ARE TIMES

00:34:07.912 --> 00:34:09.614
WHEN THE LINES OF WORKING IN A

00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:12.517
PRISON AND SERVING TIME IN THE

00:34:12.583 --> 00:34:14.018
PRISONS THEY BLUR. AND WHAT

00:34:14.085 --> 00:34:16.621
HAPPENS IS- LIVES START BEGIN

00:34:16.687 --> 00:34:19.824
TO SHAKE AND REHABILITATION IS

00:34:19.891 --> 00:34:20.425
AN EFFECTIVE. BUT IF I DON'T

00:34:20.491 --> 00:34:21.726
CHANGE THE PURPOSE AND FOCUS OF

00:34:21.793 --> 00:34:23.561
THE REHABILITATION AND THE

00:34:23.628 --> 00:34:24.295
REASON FOR OUR EMPLOYEES AND

00:34:24.362 --> 00:34:25.863
WHAT THEY DO. WHAT'S GOING TO

00:34:25.930 --> 00:34:26.697
HAPPEN IS YOU WON'T HAVE

00:34:26.764 --> 00:34:27.999
EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION YOU

00:34:28.065 --> 00:34:29.333

00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:30.635
YOU WON'T HAVE PRO SOCIAL

00:34:30.701 --> 00:34:32.737
BEHAVIORS BY THE EMPLOYEES. SO

00:34:32.804 --> 00:34:35.306
IT IS MY JOB. TO CHANGE THAT

00:34:35.373 --> 00:34:35.773
ATMOSPHERE TO GIVE THE

00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:37.742
EMPLOYEES PURPOSE. AND WHAT'S

00:34:37.809 --> 00:34:39.110

DEPARTMENTS THAT WE CHANGE. THE

00:34:44.715 --> 00:34:46.350
REASON WHY WE EXIST AND THAT'S

00:34:46.417 --> 00:34:48.653
TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO THE

00:34:48.719 --> 00:34:50.455
INDIVIDUALS WITHIN OUR SYSTEM.

00:34:50.521 --> 00:34:51.789
THE REDUCTIONS HAVE BEEN MADE

00:34:51.856 --> 00:34:54.725
POSSIBLE IN LARGE PART BY MANY

00:34:54.792 --> 00:34:55.326
OF THE THINGS YOU JUST HEARD I

WON'T GO OVER THEM AGAIN BUT I

00:34:56.227 --> 00:34:57.161
THINK ONE THING THAT WASN'T

DISCUSSED THAT. HAS BEEN ON.

00:34:59.931 --> 00:35:01.399

COURT'S. CONSIDERATION EITHER

00:35:21.552 --> 00:35:23.387
BECAUSE OF DISCREPANCIES IN THE

00:35:23.454 --> 00:35:26.257
SENTENCING CHANGES IN THE LAW

00:35:26.324 --> 00:35:26.824
AND MORE POORLY EXCEPTIONAL

00:35:26.891 --> 00:35:30.628
BEHAVIOR I HAVE- I HAVE GLADLY

00:35:37.835 --> 00:35:39.570
WHAT THAT DOES FOR NOT ONLY ME

00:35:39.637 --> 00:35:40.872

OF THE COURT BUT THAT DOES THAT

00:35:55.319 --> 00:35:55.720
PROVIDES HOPE TO THE

00:35:55.786 --> 00:35:58.322
POPULATION. AND ALSO FORCES

00:35:58.389 --> 00:35:59.023

REDUCTIONS WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO

REDUCE OUR USE OF CONTRACT

00:37:07.625 --> 00:37:08.392
FACILITIES WHICH HAS BEEN

00:37:08.459 --> 00:37:10.127
EXPLAINED EARLIER. AND I THINK

00:37:10.194 --> 00:37:11.362
WE HAVE COME TO A POINT

00:37:11.429 --> 00:37:13.564
CORRECTIONS WE REALIZE. THAT

00:37:13.631 --> 00:37:15.399
THE DAYS OF OVERCROWDING WERE

00:37:15.466 --> 00:37:15.833
NOT THE GOOD DAYS OF

00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:18.235
CORRECTIONS- THERE WAS A DAY

00:37:18.302 --> 00:37:20.271
WHEN I WAS A DAY TO DAY PRISON

00:37:20.338 --> 00:37:21.072
OPERATOR AS A CAPTAIN ON THE

THESE TRIPLE BUNK FACILITIES

00:37:24.542 --> 00:37:26.410
THAT THAT HAVE BEEN EXPLAINED.

00:37:26.477 --> 00:37:27.545
OR THE LACK OF REHABILITATIVE

00:37:27.612 --> 00:37:29.347
RESOURCES WERE NOT THERE AND

00:37:29.413 --> 00:37:30.881
THEY WERE VERY BASIC. BASIC

00:37:30.948 --> 00:37:33.417
EDUCATION AND A GOOD PROGRAMS

00:37:33.484 --> 00:37:35.686
BUT THEY WERE VERY BASIC- THERE

00:37:35.753 --> 00:37:37.722
WAS A HARD PLACE TO WORK- SO

00:37:37.788 --> 00:37:40.658
NOW AS I SAID THE SECRETARY.

00:37:40.725 --> 00:37:41.926

THOUGHTS ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON

00:40:36.767 --> 00:40:37.802
WITH PRISON CLOSURES IN OTHER

MAN THAT HAD BEEN INSPIRED

00:40:44.441 --> 00:40:46.544
PERHAPS BY OTHER STATES- AND

00:40:46.610 --> 00:40:47.912
ALSO TALK ABOUT A KEY CHALLENGE

00:40:47.978 --> 00:40:50.247
ON THE HORIZON- WHICH ACTUALLY

00:40:50.314 --> 00:40:51.515

00:41:01.458 --> 00:41:03.327
CORPORATION SENTENCING PROJECT

00:41:03.394 --> 00:41:05.329
IT'S CLEAR THAT ON NET OTHER

00:41:05.396 --> 00:41:07.131
STATES HAVE BEEN REDUCING THE

00:41:07.198 --> 00:41:08.432
NUMBER OF CORRECTIONAL BAD BY

00:41:08.499 --> 00:41:11.001
TENS OF THOUSANDS OVER THE LAST

00:41:11.068 --> 00:41:12.837
DECADE- A NUMBER OF FACILITIES

00:41:12.903 --> 00:41:14.438
HAVE BEEN CLOSE WHILE WE ALL

00:41:14.505 --> 00:41:17.107
TALK ABOUT PRISON CLOSURES IN

00:41:17.174 --> 00:41:18.776
FACT IT REALLY RARE THAT A

00:41:18.843 --> 00:41:22.012
LARGE- IS STATE OWNED FACILITY

00:41:22.079 --> 00:41:23.814
WOULD BE CLOSED WITH OFTEN

00:41:23.881 --> 00:41:25.249
BEING CLOSED ARE SMALLER

00:41:25.316 --> 00:41:26.984
MINIMUM MEDIUM TERM FACILITY.

00:41:27.051 --> 00:41:28.619
ISN'T A LOT OF OTHER STATES ARE

00:41:28.686 --> 00:41:30.154
PHASING OUT CONTRACTS WITH

00:41:30.221 --> 00:41:31.188
PRIDE IN PRINT PRIVATE PRISON

00:41:31.255 --> 00:41:33.657

CLOSED SO A LOT OF WHAT WE HEAR

00:41:37.595 --> 00:41:38.295
WHEN WE HEAR PRISON CLOSURES

00:41:38.362 --> 00:41:40.197
IT'S IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN MIND

00:41:40.264 --> 00:41:41.866
THAT IT'S NOT NECESSARILY THE

00:41:41.932 --> 00:41:43.901
BIG FACILITIES WERE HOPING TO

00:41:43.968 --> 00:41:44.635
EVENTUALLY GET TO HEARING WELL

00:41:44.702 --> 00:41:46.237
FOR ME A LOT OF STATES HAVE

00:41:46.303 --> 00:41:47.972
BEEN DOWNSIZING THE TYPES OF

00:41:48.038 --> 00:41:49.540
FACILITIES ON THE CALIFORNIA

00:41:49.607 --> 00:41:51.075
HAS BEEN UNDERTAKING FOR THE

00:41:51.141 --> 00:41:54.311
LAST FEW YEARS- SO DOWNSIZING.

00:41:54.378 --> 00:41:56.780
FOR A MIX OF REASONS A LOT OF

00:41:56.847 --> 00:41:58.249
STATES HAVE HAD BUDGET PROBLEMS

00:41:58.315 --> 00:42:00.317
THEY LOOK FOR SAY LOOK TO THE

00:42:00.384 --> 00:42:04.488
CA BY IN NAY FIVE THEY CAN

00:42:04.555 --> 00:42:09.159
SQUEEZE SOME THERE ARE BE THE

00:42:09.226 --> 00:42:14.732
FALL CRIME RATES THE CAR ARE

00:42:14.798 --> 00:42:19.536
TRACK HE SAID STAY OF A DAY.

00:42:19.603 --> 00:42:26.243
THEY HAVE TO. MEET THE

00:42:26.310 --> 00:42:27.811
REQUIREMENTS OF THE TWENTIETH

00:42:27.878 --> 00:42:30.214
OR THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY- SO

00:42:30.281 --> 00:42:31.682
THERE IS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW YOU

00:42:31.749 --> 00:42:32.783
MAY GET RID OF THE FACILITY

00:42:32.850 --> 00:42:34.218
BECAUSE YOU WANT TO INCREASE

00:42:34.285 --> 00:42:36.954
OPERATIONAL FACIL EFFICIENCIES

AND OF COURSE THERE'S ALSO BEEN

00:42:38.122 --> 00:42:39.890
A BIG MOVING ACROSS THE NATION

TO CUT TIES- WITH PRIVATE

00:42:41.759 --> 00:42:43.560
PRISON CONTRACTORS OBVIOUSLY

00:42:43.627 --> 00:42:44.862
THAT'S BEEN AN APPROACH THAT

00:42:44.929 --> 00:42:46.530
THIS LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR

00:42:46.597 --> 00:42:48.632

IN STATE PRIVATE FACILITIES

00:43:52.930 --> 00:43:53.931
THEN EVENT HOPE IS WE GET TO

00:43:53.998 --> 00:43:55.432
THE BIGELOW AS HAS BEEN ALLUDED

IN OTHER STATES TYPICALLY

00:44:06.643 --> 00:44:08.012
STATES TRY TO AVOID MASS

00:44:08.078 --> 00:44:09.179
LAYOFFS SO WHAT HAPPENS IS A

00:44:09.246 --> 00:44:10.781
LOT OF PEOPLE MAY DECIDE- IT'S

00:44:10.848 --> 00:44:12.816

OF GOOD PAYING JOBS LOST THAT'S

00:45:34.731 --> 00:45:36.100
NOT A REASON TO KEEP THE

00:45:36.166 --> 00:45:37.434
FACILITY OPENED BUT IT IS A

00:45:37.501 --> 00:45:38.902
REASON TO THINK ABOUT IS THERE

00:45:38.969 --> 00:45:40.771
A WAY TO REPURPOSE THE FACILITY

00:45:40.838 --> 00:45:42.539
CAN YOU FIND WAYS TO ENCOURAGE

00:45:42.606 --> 00:45:45.142

FURTHER REDUCE INCARCERATION-

00:45:55.352 --> 00:45:56.353
WE HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE FIRST

00:45:56.420 --> 00:45:58.288
OBVIOUSLY CALIFORNIA HAS TAKEN

00:45:58.355 --> 00:45:59.089
SOME HUGE STEPS THIS

00:45:59.156 --> 00:46:01.258
LEGISLATURE. PRIOR GOVERNOR IS

00:46:01.325 --> 00:46:02.693

LEADERS BUT THERE'S MORE THAT

00:46:09.967 --> 00:46:12.069
CAN BE DONE AND I HAVE A COUPLE

00:46:12.136 --> 00:46:13.003
OF THOUGHTS SO MINUTE THROW OUT

00:46:13.070 --> 00:46:14.138
THERE THAT KIND OF FIT INTO

00:46:14.204 --> 00:46:15.939
THAT. GO BIG OR GO HOME

00:46:16.006 --> 00:46:18.142
CATEGORY ONE IS INSPIRED BY NEW

00:46:18.208 --> 00:46:19.543
YORK THE OTHERS INSPIRED BY

00:46:19.610 --> 00:46:21.578
TEXAS- SO THE FIRST THOUGHT

00:46:21.645 --> 00:46:23.046
SORT OF INSPIRED BY NEW YORK

00:46:23.113 --> 00:46:24.548
WHICH RECENTLY REPEAL THE

00:46:24.615 --> 00:46:26.383
ROCKEFELLER DRUG LAWS SO THESE

00:46:26.450 --> 00:46:27.618
GO BACK TO THE NINETEEN

00:46:27.684 --> 00:46:29.653
SEVENTIES MANDATORY MINIMUM.

00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:30.954
SENTENCES THAT ARE

00:46:31.021 --> 00:46:32.289
DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED

WITH NO GAINS IN PUBLIC SAFETY

00:46:38.495 --> 00:46:40.464
RECENTLY THE LEGISLATURE SAID

00:46:40.531 --> 00:46:41.598
WELL. LET'S GO LET'S BACK LET'S

00:46:41.665 --> 00:46:42.599
JUST GT RID OF IT THIS DOESN'T

00:46:42.666 --> 00:46:43.967
MAKE SENSE ANYMORE WE CAN'T

00:46:44.034 --> 00:46:45.435
LIVE UNDER LAWS THAT WERE

00:46:45.502 --> 00:46:47.137
PASSED. UNDER BY A PRIOR

00:46:47.204 --> 00:46:49.072
GENERATIONS SO THIS MAY BE THE

00:46:49.139 --> 00:46:50.974
TIME FOR ALL YOU HAVE TO GO TO

00:46:51.041 --> 00:46:52.910
THE VOTERS FOR FOLKS TO START

00:46:52.976 --> 00:46:54.244
THINKING IN CALIFORNIA ABOUT

00:46:54.311 --> 00:46:56.013
FURTHER MODIFYING THE THREE

00:46:56.079 --> 00:46:57.948
STRIKES LAW WE TOOK ON THE

00:46:58.015 --> 00:46:59.483
THIRD STRIKE IN TWO THOUSAND

TWELVE WITH PROP THIRTY SIX.

00:47:00.984 --> 00:47:02.920
FOR SECOND STRIKERS- FOR

EVERYONE WHO GETS A SECOND

00:47:04.221 --> 00:47:06.123
STRIKE ON FOR A FELONY EUROPE

00:47:06.190 --> 00:47:07.758
SENTENCES AUTOMATICALLY DOUBLE

00:47:07.824 --> 00:47:11.128
THE RESEARCH DOES NOT SUPPORT

00:47:11.195 --> 00:47:17.134
THE CONTENTION LONGER. IS IT TO

00:47:17.201 --> 00:47:20.337

BE RE GOING VERY WOULD BE

00:47:34.685 --> 00:47:35.986
CALLING FOR A FULL SCALE REPEAL

00:47:36.053 --> 00:47:37.421
OF THREE STRIKES WHO KNOWS IF

00:47:37.487 --> 00:47:38.956
THE CALIFORNIA VOTERS ARE READY

00:47:39.022 --> 00:47:40.457
FOR THAT OR IF THIS LEGISLATURE

00:47:40.524 --> 00:47:41.925
IS READY FOR THAT BUT THAT

00:47:41.992 --> 00:47:42.626
WOULD BE ONE OF THOSE

00:47:42.693 --> 00:47:44.461
GENERATIONAL SHIFT THAT YOU

00:47:44.528 --> 00:47:46.263
COULD IMAGINE PROBABLY

00:47:46.330 --> 00:47:48.065
HAPPENING WITHIN A FEW YEARS-

00:47:48.131 --> 00:47:49.766
SECONDLY- WE NEED TO

CALIFORNIA THE GOVERNOR

00:48:34.111 --> 00:48:36.747

HAVE TO START ASKING OURSELVES

00:48:49.359 --> 00:48:52.362
HARD QUESTIONS IS THIS THE

00:48:52.429 --> 00:48:54.197
APPROPRIATE WAY TO BE

00:48:54.264 --> 00:48:56.166
ADDRESSING THE NEEDS OF PEOPLE

THROUGH THEIR PRISON SYSTEM

00:49:29.199 --> 00:49:30.901
THAT IS ONE OF THE FIRST PLACES

00:49:30.967 --> 00:49:32.469
THEY LOOKED FOR SOLUTIONS TO

00:49:32.536 --> 00:49:35.205
THEIR- BALDING. PRISONS THEY

00:49:35.272 --> 00:49:36.440

FOR. THIS THAT. FINAL THOUGHT

00:49:48.318 --> 00:49:49.853
HERE CHALLENGES ON THE HORIZON

00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:52.089
AS THOMAS JEFFERSON SAID IN THE

00:49:52.155 --> 00:49:54.491
SMASH HIT HAMILTON EVERY ACTION

IF WE'RE GONNA START NIBBLING

00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:18.181

RECENT YEARS THERE'S OPERA

00:50:23.954 --> 00:50:25.622
PROPOSAL TO REPEAL BAIL REFORM

00:50:25.689 --> 00:50:26.890
THAT GUY THAT THIS LEGISLATURE

00:50:26.957 --> 00:50:28.759

SIGNED A LAW BY GOVERNOR BROWN.

00:50:30.794 --> 00:50:31.261
THERE'S ALSO GOING TO BE A

00:50:31.328 --> 00:50:34.097
PROPOSAL TO CHIP AWAY AT PROP

FORTY SEVEN AND PROP FIFTY

00:50:36.133 --> 00:50:36.967
SEVEN IN A WAY THAT WOULD DRIVE

00:50:37.033 --> 00:50:39.269
UP STATE AND LOCAL CORRECTIONAL

00:50:39.336 --> 00:50:41.805
SPENDING. AND ALSO SLOW THE

00:50:41.872 --> 00:50:44.274
STATE'S MOMENT COME IN REDUCING

00:50:44.341 --> 00:50:45.609
THE PRISON POPULATION THE

00:50:45.675 --> 00:50:46.643
NUMBER THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:50:46.710 --> 00:50:48.345
FINANCE JUST SHOWED YOU FOR

00:50:48.412 --> 00:50:49.780
THEIR PROJECTIONS OF THE PRISON

00:50:49.846 --> 00:50:51.348
POPULATION FIVE YEARS FROM NOW

00:50:51.415 --> 00:50:53.250
ASSUME CURRENT LAW THE STATUS

00:50:53.316 --> 00:50:56.953
QUO. OKAY THAT'S GREAT BUT WHAT

00:50:57.020 --> 00:50:58.855
IF THE STATUS QUO CHANGES THAT

00:50:58.922 --> 00:51:01.324
MEANS YOU HAVE- PROBABLY

00:51:01.391 --> 00:51:04.060
ELIMINATED YOUR OPPORTUNITY TO

00:51:04.127 --> 00:51:05.829
CLOSE THE STATE PRISON IN FIVE

00:51:05.896 --> 00:51:07.864
YEARS SO IT'S REALLY SOMETHING.

00:51:07.931 --> 00:51:10.801
TO KEEP IN MIND- AS WE DEBATE

00:51:10.867 --> 00:51:11.968
THIS IT HASN'T GONE ON THE

00:51:12.035 --> 00:51:13.770
BALLOT YET BUT THIS MEASURE HAS

00:51:13.837 --> 00:51:15.272
QUALIFIED AND I WOULD ASSUME

00:51:15.338 --> 00:51:17.073
IT'S VERY LIKELY TO BE PLACED

00:51:17.140 --> 00:51:18.708
ON THE BALLOT BY THIS I THINK

00:51:18.775 --> 00:51:19.843
IT'S A JUNE DEADLINE. SO THAT'S

00:51:19.910 --> 00:51:20.844
REALLY SOMETHING TO KEEP IN

00:51:20.911 --> 00:51:22.345
MIND NOT NECESSARILY ANYTHING

00:51:22.412 --> 00:51:23.680
THIS LEGISLATURE CAN DO

00:51:23.747 --> 00:51:27.050
SOMETHING ABOUT- BUT IT IT'S

00:51:27.117 --> 00:51:27.918
GOING TO BE A TEST OF

00:51:27.984 --> 00:51:30.320

WIDELY FROM ON COMMON LAW WHAT

REPRESENTATION TO PEOPLE WHO

ARE SERVING LIFE SENTENCES AND-

00:52:49.599 --> 00:52:51.868
I THINK THE NUMBER MAY BEEN

00:52:51.935 --> 00:52:54.271
MENTIONED EARLIER BUT- I. HAS

00:52:54.337 --> 00:52:54.838
THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE

00:52:54.905 --> 00:52:56.640
SERVING LIFE SENTENCES. THE

00:52:56.706 --> 00:52:57.207
NUMBER NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE

00:52:57.274 --> 00:52:58.942
KNOW- I WELCOME THIS

00:52:59.009 --> 00:53:00.810
OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THE

00:53:00.877 --> 00:53:03.113
COMMITTEE TODAY BECAUSE- I

00:53:03.179 --> 00:53:05.515
THINK THAT WE AS A SOCIETY WE

00:53:05.582 --> 00:53:06.116
WE'VE INVENTED INVENTED MANY

00:53:06.182 --> 00:53:09.986
WAYS TO- DEHUMANIZE PEOPLE AS

00:53:10.053 --> 00:53:13.456
WE- PROSECUTE AND CONVICT AND

00:53:13.523 --> 00:53:15.091
SENTENCE THEM TO PRISON. WE

00:53:15.158 --> 00:53:18.194
SENT THEM TO LONGER TERMS AT

00:53:18.261 --> 00:53:20.997
YOUNGER AGES AT THINK IT'S WELL

00:53:21.064 --> 00:53:23.400
PAST TIME WE FIND SOME SAFE

00:53:23.466 --> 00:53:24.935
PATHWAYS TO BRING THEM BACK

00:53:25.001 --> 00:53:27.404
HOME. THE GOVERNOR'S GOALS TO

00:53:27.470 --> 00:53:29.573
CLOSE A PRISON AND IN THE NEXT

00:53:29.639 --> 00:53:30.740
FOUR YEARS OR SO AND I THINK

00:53:30.807 --> 00:53:33.209
THAT'S AN ATTAINABLE. GOAL IN A

00:53:33.276 --> 00:53:36.346
REASONABLE- STEP BUT- I ALSO

00:53:36.413 --> 00:53:42.018
THINK THAT. WE GET THERE BY BY

00:53:42.085 --> 00:53:44.387
SUPPORTING PROGRAMS THAT ARE.

00:53:44.454 --> 00:53:45.422
MORE RESPONSIVE TO THE NEEDS OF

00:53:45.488 --> 00:53:46.823
PEOPLE IN PRISON AND MORE

00:53:46.890 --> 00:53:48.692
RESPONSIVE TO SURVIVORS OF

00:53:48.758 --> 00:53:51.161
CRIME OPTICALLY VIOLENT CRIME

00:53:51.227 --> 00:53:52.729
BUT CRIMES IN GENERAL I THINK

00:53:52.796 --> 00:53:54.598
WE GET THERE BY TRANSFORMING

00:53:54.664 --> 00:53:55.532
THE VERY CULTURE INSIDE OF

00:53:55.599 --> 00:53:57.400
INSTITUTIONS I APPRECIATE

00:53:57.467 --> 00:53:59.603
SECRETARY D. AS IS- COMMITMENT

00:53:59.669 --> 00:54:01.805
IN HIS HIS VISION- AND WHAT

00:54:01.871 --> 00:54:04.040
THAT MIGHT LOOK LIKE I THINK WE

00:54:04.107 --> 00:54:05.642
AGREE ON A LOT OF THINGS. BUT

00:54:05.709 --> 00:54:07.877
WHEN IT COMES TO THAT AS THIS

00:54:07.944 --> 00:54:09.212
COMMITTEE IS AWARE THE COST OF

00:54:09.279 --> 00:54:12.716
PRISON. ISN'T IN IS- REALLY

00:54:12.782 --> 00:54:14.684
CONTINUES TO SOAR EVEN THOUGH.

00:54:14.751 --> 00:54:18.021
THE POPULATION. IS REDUCE COSTS

00:54:18.088 --> 00:54:19.155
SERVE OUR CREDIT WE HIGH AND I

00:54:19.222 --> 00:54:20.590
THINK. THAT'S BECAUSE PEOPLE

00:54:20.657 --> 00:54:24.861
ARE ARE. OLDER SICKER. AND THEY

00:54:24.928 --> 00:54:25.695
HAVE A GREATER NEED FOR MENTAL

00:54:25.762 --> 00:54:28.665
HEALTH SERVICES THEN CAN

00:54:28.732 --> 00:54:29.232
ACTUALLY BE MET IN A PRISON

00:54:29.299 --> 00:54:31.401
SETTING. MY OBSERVATIONS ARE

00:54:31.468 --> 00:54:32.535
GOING TO FALL INTO THE REALLY

00:54:32.602 --> 00:54:35.138
THREE BROAD CATEGORIES TODAY-

00:54:35.205 --> 00:54:37.040
ONE IS ABOUT. OF THE NEED FOR

00:54:37.107 --> 00:54:38.842
MORE RESPONSIVE PROGRAMMING

00:54:38.908 --> 00:54:41.511
INSIDE THE PRISONS- ANOTHER

00:54:41.578 --> 00:54:43.580
CATEGORIES IT IS THE NEED FOR

00:54:43.647 --> 00:54:44.414
CULTURAL CULTURAL CHANGE WITHIN

00:54:44.481 --> 00:54:46.383
THE PRISONS. AND BLAST

00:54:46.449 --> 00:54:47.517
CATEGORIES ABOUT THE MEANING

00:54:47.584 --> 00:54:50.086
THE NEED FOR MEANING FULL OF

00:54:50.153 --> 00:54:51.955
SUPPORT UPON RE ENTRY PANEL

00:54:52.022 --> 00:54:53.056
THAT'S THE FOCUS OF THIS PANEL

00:54:53.123 --> 00:54:54.924
BUT- YOU CAN'T REALLY TAKE ONE

00:54:54.991 --> 00:54:56.493
PIECE AND NOT NOT TIED TO THE

00:54:56.559 --> 00:54:57.861
REST BECAUSE IT'S ALL PART OF

00:54:57.927 --> 00:55:00.063
THE SAME. PROCESS AND SYSTEM-

00:55:00.130 --> 00:55:02.966
AND AS- AS A GOOD IDEAS NOTED

00:55:03.033 --> 00:55:04.634
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE NOT

00:55:04.701 --> 00:55:06.903
NUMBERS. AND PEOPLE LIVE IN

00:55:06.970 --> 00:55:08.104
EVERY EVERY PHASE OF THIS

00:55:08.171 --> 00:55:10.073
PROCESS AND SO IT'S IMPORTANT

00:55:10.140 --> 00:55:10.640
TO FOCUS ON WHAT THEIR NEEDS

00:55:10.707 --> 00:55:13.677
ARE. AS FOR MORE RESPONSIVE

00:55:13.743 --> 00:55:15.311
PROGRAMMING. OF THE

00:55:15.378 --> 00:55:16.613
OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF PEOPLE

00:55:16.680 --> 00:55:18.615
IN OUR PRISONS ARE SURVIVORS OF

00:55:18.682 --> 00:55:20.750
PHYSICAL OR EMOTIONAL TRAUMA.

00:55:20.817 --> 00:55:25.255
ESTIMATES RANGE FROM 6270% OF.

00:55:25.321 --> 00:55:27.891
THOSE WHO IDENTIFY AS MALE AND

00:55:27.957 --> 00:55:30.827
95% FOR THOSE BY DEVICE FEMALE

00:55:30.894 --> 00:55:32.228
AND EVEN HIGHER RATES AMONG

00:55:32.295 --> 00:55:35.732
TRANSGENDER POPULATION- ARE

00:55:35.799 --> 00:55:36.366
SURVIVORS OF PHYSICAL EMOTIONAL

00:55:36.433 --> 00:55:39.135
TRAUMA. AND RESPONDING TO

00:55:39.202 --> 00:55:41.938
TRAUMA WITH PUNISHMENT IS

00:55:42.005 --> 00:55:42.706
PROVEN ITSELF TO BE ONE OF THE

00:55:42.772 --> 00:55:45.075
LEAST EFFECTIVE- MOST HARMFUL

00:55:45.141 --> 00:55:47.210
AND EXPENSE OF THINGS WE CAN DO

00:55:47.277 --> 00:55:49.913
TO OTHER HUMAN BEINGS. AND SO-

00:55:49.979 --> 00:55:51.214
IT'S NOT JUST THE PEOPLE

00:55:51.281 --> 00:55:52.449
INVOLVED IN PRISON IT'S THEIR

00:55:52.515 --> 00:55:53.249
FAMILIES AND THEIR COMMUNITIES

00:55:53.316 --> 00:55:56.553
SO- WE URGE A HEALING APPROACH.

00:55:56.619 --> 00:55:59.322
INSTEAD I THINK THIS STARTS

00:55:59.389 --> 00:56:00.924
WITH SCREENING PEOPLE WHEN THEY

00:56:00.990 --> 00:56:03.727
FIRST COME INTO PRISON- TO

00:56:03.793 --> 00:56:05.261
IDENTIFY WHAT TYPES OF ADVERSE

00:56:05.328 --> 00:56:07.197
CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES. AND

00:56:07.263 --> 00:56:09.032
TRAUMA THEY'VE HAD IT'S NOT

00:56:09.099 --> 00:56:11.401
SOMETHING WE DO RIGHT NOW- AND

00:56:11.468 --> 00:56:13.470
THEN WE CAN ACTUALLY. SUPPORT

00:56:13.536 --> 00:56:15.405
THE PROGRAMS THAT THAT HELP

00:56:15.472 --> 00:56:18.007
ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES. CURRENTLY

00:56:18.074 --> 00:56:19.309
THE COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL

00:56:19.375 --> 00:56:20.643
APPROACH TO PRISON PROGRAMMING

00:56:20.710 --> 00:56:23.113
FALL FAILS TO ADDRESS THE ROOT

00:56:23.179 --> 00:56:26.483
CAUSES- WHICH CAN USUALLY BE

00:56:26.549 --> 00:56:27.650
TRACED BACK TO AN ORIGINAL

00:56:27.717 --> 00:56:30.153
TRAUMA BURIED BENEATH. DECADES

00:56:30.220 --> 00:56:32.989
OF PROTECTIVE LAYERS THAT

00:56:33.056 --> 00:56:34.958
PEOPLE CREATE TO KEEP

00:56:35.024 --> 00:56:38.061
THEMSELVES SAFE. I THINK THE

00:56:38.128 --> 00:56:40.764
PROBOARDS IS BY RECOGNIZING THE

00:56:40.830 --> 00:56:44.234
BENEFITS OF HAVING PEOPLE DO

00:56:44.300 --> 00:56:46.236
THIS DEEP INTROSPECTIVE WORK.

00:56:46.302 --> 00:56:48.204
ALTHOUGH I DON'T AGREE THAT THE

00:56:48.271 --> 00:56:49.973
FAILURE TO DO THIS WORK

00:56:50.039 --> 00:56:53.042
CORRELATES TO RISK OF VIOLENCE.

00:56:53.109 --> 00:56:54.444
NEVERTHELESS I THINK THE

00:56:54.511 --> 00:56:57.046
PROBLEM REALLY IS THAT WHILE.

00:56:57.113 --> 00:56:58.414
PROBOARDS GRANTING PAROLE TO

00:56:58.481 --> 00:56:59.916
PEOPLE WHO'VE DONE THIS WORK

00:56:59.983 --> 00:57:02.485
THERE TOO FEW PROGRAMS AND TOO

00:57:02.552 --> 00:57:04.387
FEW SAFE SPACES WITHIN THE

00:57:04.454 --> 00:57:08.258
PRESENCE ACTUALLY DO THE WORK.

00:57:08.324 --> 00:57:09.859
AS FOR THE CULTURE CHANGE

00:57:09.926 --> 00:57:11.995
WITHIN THE PRISONS I- AS I SAID

00:57:12.061 --> 00:57:14.030
I DO COMMEND SECRETARY D. AS

00:57:14.097 --> 00:57:16.599
FOR HIS VISION OF A NEW CULTURE

00:57:16.666 --> 00:57:18.935
INSIDE AND IT ESPECIALLY IS

00:57:19.002 --> 00:57:20.036
RECOGNITION OF THE IMPORTANT

00:57:20.103 --> 00:57:22.038
ROLE. OF FORMERLY INCARCERATED

00:57:22.105 --> 00:57:26.009
PEOPLE AND REALLY TRANSFORMING-

00:57:26.075 --> 00:57:28.011
WHAT AND WHAT SAFETY LOOKS LIKE

00:57:28.077 --> 00:57:28.878
INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE

00:57:28.945 --> 00:57:30.713
PRESIDING THE COMMUNITY IN A

00:57:30.780 --> 00:57:33.583
MEANINGFUL WAY- I THINK WE HAVE

00:57:33.650 --> 00:57:35.885
TO REJECT THE CONCEPT OF US

00:57:35.952 --> 00:57:37.654
VERSUS THEM. WHEN WE'RE TALKING

00:57:37.720 --> 00:57:41.424
ABOUT PUBLIC SAFETY. BECAUSE

00:57:41.491 --> 00:57:44.861
WE'RE BOTH WERE US IN THEM. AND

00:57:44.928 --> 00:57:46.596
THAT'S TRUE WITHIN THE PRISONS

00:57:46.663 --> 00:57:47.197
AND WITHIN THE LARGER SOCIETY

00:57:47.263 --> 00:57:49.599
AT THING THAT WE CREATE A US A

00:57:49.666 --> 00:57:51.100
SAFER AND MORE PRODUCTIVE

00:57:51.167 --> 00:57:53.203
SOCIETY WHEN WE COME CLOSER

00:57:53.269 --> 00:57:54.437
TOGETHER RATHER THAN MORE

00:57:54.504 --> 00:57:56.406
DISTANT AND ISOLATED FROM EACH

00:57:56.472 --> 00:57:57.807
OTHER AND I THINK PRISON

00:57:57.874 --> 00:58:00.376
OFFICIALS. ALSO REALIZE JUST

00:58:00.443 --> 00:58:02.145
HOW DAMAGING PRISON IS FOR

00:58:02.212 --> 00:58:04.914
THOSE WHO WORK THERE. ASIDE

00:58:04.981 --> 00:58:06.583
FROM VIOLENCE AND SOME OF THE

00:58:06.649 --> 00:58:08.885
INSTITUTIONS OF THEIR STAFF OF

00:58:08.952 --> 00:58:10.220
SOME OF THE HIGHEST RATES OF

00:58:10.286 --> 00:58:13.289
DEPRESSION SUICIDE POOR HEALTH

00:58:13.356 --> 00:58:15.191
OUTCOMES OF ANY PROFESSION. A

00:58:15.258 --> 00:58:16.793
PRISON IS SIMPLY A BAD PLACE

00:58:16.860 --> 00:58:20.496
FOR EVERYBODY. BUT PEOPLE WHO

00:58:20.563 --> 00:58:23.032
WHO DO FIND A COMMUNITY INSIDE

00:58:23.099 --> 00:58:23.967
PRISON WHERE THEY CAN PROCESS

00:58:24.033 --> 00:58:26.536
TRAUMA ARE MUCH MORE SUCCESSFUL

00:58:26.603 --> 00:58:27.136
WHEN THEY APPEARED BEFORE THE

00:58:27.203 --> 00:58:29.038
PAROLE BOARD. AND THOSE WERE

00:58:29.105 --> 00:58:30.940
RELEASED THROUGH THE PRO WAR TO

00:58:31.007 --> 00:58:31.541
MUCH MORE SUCCESSFUL AFTER THE

00:58:31.608 --> 00:58:33.476
RELEASE. AND THE COST SAVINGS

00:58:33.543 --> 00:58:35.845
ARE HUGE- IN IN OUR

00:58:35.912 --> 00:58:39.182
ORGANIZATION WE'VE NOW SEEN TWO

00:58:39.249 --> 00:58:41.584
HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR OF OUR-

00:58:41.651 --> 00:58:44.921
LICENSE CLIENTS RELEASED. AND

00:58:44.988 --> 00:58:46.789
EVERY YEAR THEY STAY OUT OF

00:58:46.856 --> 00:58:47.357
PRISON SAVE THE STATE NINETY

00:58:47.423 --> 00:58:49.492
MILLION DOLLARS. JUST THOSE TWO

00:58:49.559 --> 00:58:53.263
AND FORTY FOUR. IF WE JUST

00:58:53.329 --> 00:58:55.031
THINK THIS DEMONSTRATED

00:58:55.098 --> 00:58:58.468
INVESTING AND COUNSELING AND-

00:58:58.534 --> 00:59:00.603
IN THE SOCIAL EMOTIONAL SUPPORT

00:59:00.670 --> 00:59:02.005
THAT THE PEOPLE NEED TRANSLATES

00:59:02.071 --> 00:59:04.040
INTO GREATER SAFETY WITHIN THE

00:59:04.107 --> 00:59:04.707
PRISONS AND OUTSIDE IN THE

00:59:04.774 --> 00:59:08.344
COMMUNITY- THE CATEGORY OF THIS

00:59:08.411 --> 00:59:09.545
MEANINGFUL SUPPORT UPON RE

00:59:09.612 --> 00:59:12.081
ENTRY. IS A HUGE ONE AND YOU'RE

00:59:12.148 --> 00:59:14.083
GONNA HEAR SOME EXPERTS ON THAT

00:59:14.150 --> 00:59:16.352
IN A MINUTE. I'M A TALK FROM

00:59:16.419 --> 00:59:17.987
ABOUT TRANSITIONAL HOUSING

00:59:18.054 --> 00:59:20.023
SPECIFICALLY- TRANSITIONAL

00:59:20.089 --> 00:59:21.624
HOUSING SOMETIMES REFERRED TO

00:59:21.691 --> 00:59:24.160
AS HALFWAY HOUSES- THEY CAN BE

00:59:24.227 --> 00:59:25.561
HELPFUL FOR PEOPLE RETURNING

00:59:25.628 --> 00:59:27.363
FROM PRISON ESPECIALLY

00:59:27.430 --> 00:59:29.465
FOLLOWING LONG LONG TERMS IN

00:59:29.532 --> 00:59:31.601
PRISON CLING LICENSES- HOWEVER

00:59:31.668 --> 00:59:33.269
THE FACILITIES THAT ARE

00:59:33.336 --> 00:59:35.905
OPERATED BY FOR PROFIT

00:59:35.972 --> 00:59:37.874
COMPANIES. TO FOCUS ON ON

00:59:37.941 --> 00:59:40.109
RESTRICTION AND PUNISHMENT TO

00:59:40.176 --> 00:59:43.780
REDUCE RECIDIVISM RATHER THAN

00:59:43.846 --> 00:59:44.247
FOCUSING ON MEASURING

00:59:44.314 --> 00:59:46.449
RECIDIVISM WE ACTUALLY THEY

00:59:46.516 --> 00:59:48.151
SHOULD FOCUS ON- COMMUNITY

00:59:48.217 --> 00:59:51.220
CONNECTIONS AND SOCIAL

00:59:51.287 --> 00:59:52.355
EMOTIONAL SUPPORT WE THINK

00:59:52.422 --> 00:59:53.756
RECIDIVISM ITSELF IS REALLY A

00:59:53.823 --> 00:59:57.627
POOR MEASURE OF- OF SUCCESS

00:59:57.694 --> 00:59:58.227
BECAUSE IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY

00:59:58.294 --> 00:59:59.896
TELL YOU MUCH ABOUT WHAT

00:59:59.963 --> 01:00:00.697
SOMEONE'S LIFE LOOKS LIKE ON

01:00:00.763 --> 01:00:03.366
THE OUTSIDE. MOST OF US ARE WE

01:00:03.433 --> 01:00:04.767
ON OUR WAY BACK TO PRISON.

01:00:04.834 --> 01:00:06.069
DOESN'T TELL YOU MUCH ABOUT

01:00:06.135 --> 01:00:08.705
WHAT OUR LIVES LIKE. THAT'S

01:00:08.771 --> 01:00:09.238
TRUE EVERYONE ELSE IN THE

01:00:09.305 --> 01:00:13.476
COMMUNITY. ONE OF THE THINGS I

01:00:13.543 --> 01:00:16.112

01:00:39.869 --> 01:00:41.337
DISTURBING CONCERNING WHO

CONTINUED- OFFICES ON

01:01:07.296 --> 01:01:10.767
RECIDIVISM AS THE KEY INDICATOR

01:01:10.833 --> 01:01:12.502
OF RE ENTRY AND PAROLE SUCCESS.

01:01:12.568 --> 01:01:14.170
AND THAT CONTRIBUTES TO PROGRAM

01:01:14.237 --> 01:01:15.171
ENVIRONMENTS THAT ARE BASICALLY

01:01:15.238 --> 01:01:18.608
LIKE PRISONS MMHM- THEY'RE

01:01:18.674 --> 01:01:20.043
VIRTUALLY IDENTICAL A LOT OF A

01:01:20.109 --> 01:01:21.444
LOT OF WAS FURTHER ISOLATING

01:01:21.511 --> 01:01:22.178

STRUCTURES THAT THE THAT ARE

01:01:26.082 --> 01:01:26.516
ESSENTIAL TO THEIR FULL

01:01:26.582 --> 01:01:27.917
REINTEGRATION. THIS INCLUDES

01:01:27.984 --> 01:01:30.319

OUTSIDE SOMETIMES THEY'RE GOING.

01:01:42.965 --> 01:01:44.167
BEING FORCED TO SIT THROUGH

01:01:44.233 --> 01:01:47.070
HOURS OF IRRELEVANT PROGRAMMING.

01:01:47.136 --> 01:01:48.037
IT INTERFERES WITH MORE

01:01:48.104 --> 01:01:51.307
MEANINGFUL AND PRODUCTIVE-

01:01:51.374 --> 01:01:53.342
ACTIVITIES SUCH AS AN

01:01:53.409 --> 01:01:55.178
EMPLOYMENT AND EDUCATIONAL

01:01:55.244 --> 01:01:57.313
OPPORTUNITIES BUT ALSO INCLUDES

01:01:57.380 --> 01:02:00.550
A PATRONIZING AND PATERNALISTIC

01:02:00.616 --> 01:02:01.117
WAY OF CONTROLLING RESIDENTS

01:02:01.184 --> 01:02:03.252
MONEY. WITHOUT TEACHING THEM

01:02:03.319 --> 01:02:04.887
ANY KIND OF FINANCIAL LITERACY

01:02:04.954 --> 01:02:08.424

SOMEONE FULLY REINTEGRATE AND

01:02:14.363 --> 01:02:15.264
FEEL LIKE THEY'RE PART OF THE

01:02:15.331 --> 01:02:17.133
COMMUNITY ANOTHER FINDING WAS

01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:19.035
THAT- WHILE THEY'RE THERE

01:02:19.102 --> 01:02:20.870
CONSIDERABLE CONCERNS ABOUT THE

01:02:20.937 --> 01:02:22.805
STATE HAVING CONTRACT WITH

01:02:22.872 --> 01:02:24.474
PRIVATE FOR PROFIT COMPANIES.

01:02:24.540 --> 01:02:27.777
LIKE THE GEO GROUP. OTHER

01:02:27.844 --> 01:02:30.179
TRANSITIONAL FACILITIES. THAT

01:02:30.246 --> 01:02:33.015
DON'T RECEIVE STATE FUNDING.

01:02:33.082 --> 01:02:34.884
HAVE VIRTUALLY NO OVERSIGHT. NO

01:02:34.951 --> 01:02:36.152
REGULATION WE DON'T ATUALLY

01:02:36.219 --> 01:02:38.654
KNOW WHAT THEY DO- AND THEIR

01:02:38.721 --> 01:02:39.188
PRACTICES ARE ALL OVER THE

01:02:39.255 --> 01:02:41.824
PLACE. AND THAT THAT REPRESENTS

01:02:41.891 --> 01:02:44.660
A OF A LOT OF THE TRANSITIONAL

01:02:44.727 --> 01:02:46.963
HOUSING THERE THE FUNDED BY. I

01:02:47.029 --> 01:02:49.098
WOULD FOUNDATIONS OR JUST OF-

01:02:49.165 --> 01:02:50.700
THEY FOUND FIND OF INDIVIDUAL

01:02:50.766 --> 01:02:52.368
DONORS TO SUPPORT THEIR WORK.

01:02:52.435 --> 01:02:54.303
AND THEY JUST SORT OF CREATE A

01:02:54.370 --> 01:02:56.906
PROGRAM THAT THEY ONCE WE HAVE

01:02:56.973 --> 01:02:59.075
BEEN A NONPROFIT I SUPPORT-

01:02:59.142 --> 01:03:00.409
BEING CREATIVE IN FINDING WAYS

01:03:00.476 --> 01:03:03.880
TO SUPPORT PEOPLE. BUT WHEN

01:03:03.946 --> 01:03:05.715
PEOPLE RUN THEM LIKE PRISONS I

01:03:05.781 --> 01:03:07.850
DON'T SUPPORT THAT. AND I THINK

01:03:07.917 --> 01:03:08.784
IT'S CONTRARY TO WHAT WE'RE

01:03:08.851 --> 01:03:10.453
TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH IN THESE

01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:13.156
THESE PROGRAMS. SOME OF THE

01:03:13.222 --> 01:03:13.723
RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THAT

01:03:13.789 --> 01:03:16.993
REPORT. A FOCUS ON TRANSITIONAL

01:03:17.059 --> 01:03:21.697
PROGRAMS. THEY INCLUDE HEY

01:03:21.764 --> 01:03:24.400
FOCUSING AS MUCH OR MORE ON THE

01:03:24.467 --> 01:03:27.637
SOCIAL EMOTIONAL SUPPORT THE-

01:03:27.703 --> 01:03:28.237
AS COMPARED TO SIMPLY HOUSING

01:03:28.304 --> 01:03:33.442
PEOPLE AND ALSO. CREATING SOME

01:03:33.509 --> 01:03:35.711
CLARITY AND CONSISTENCY IN THE

01:03:35.778 --> 01:03:37.380
DEFINITION OF WHAT SUCCESS EVEN

01:03:37.446 --> 01:03:39.582
MEANS AFTER PRESIDENT- IT CAN'T

01:03:39.649 --> 01:03:40.683
JUST BE WHETHER OR NOT PEOPLE

01:03:40.750 --> 01:03:43.519
ACTORS RIGHT- IT CAN'T JUST BE

01:03:43.586 --> 01:03:46.656
THAT- WE THINK THAT THAT WE

01:03:46.722 --> 01:03:48.124
SHOULD BE MEASURED IN TERMS OF

01:03:48.191 --> 01:03:49.392
BETTER DESCRIBE THE QUALITY OF

01:03:49.458 --> 01:03:50.793
SOMEONE'S LIFE AND THEIR

01:03:50.860 --> 01:03:52.595
ABILITY TO FULLY PARTICIPATE AS

01:03:52.662 --> 01:03:54.430
FULL CITIZENS IN SOCIETY-

01:03:54.497 --> 01:03:56.098
REMOVING BARRIERS TO HOUSING

01:03:56.165 --> 01:03:58.167
EMPLOYMENT EDUCATION THAT THE

01:03:58.234 --> 01:04:00.503
THAT ALSO INTERFERE WITH. FULL

01:04:00.570 --> 01:04:04.006
INTEGRATION. I HAVE THE TO SAY

01:04:04.073 --> 01:04:06.509
WITH THE MISFITS IT'S REALLY

01:04:06.576 --> 01:04:07.410
MEANINGFUL TO BE SITTING HERE

01:04:07.476 --> 01:04:09.745
RIGHT NOW BECAUSE- OF THE HOTEL

01:04:09.812 --> 01:04:11.214
JOHNSON WHO YOU HEAR FROM IN A

01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:14.283
MINUTE WAS A CLIENT OF MINE

01:04:14.350 --> 01:04:16.085
ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO. AT THE

01:04:16.152 --> 01:04:19.622
TIME HE HAD BEEN GRANTED PAROLE

01:04:19.689 --> 01:04:21.691
BY THE PAROLE BOARD. AND THE

01:04:21.757 --> 01:04:24.227
GOVERNOR REVERSED. AND WE HAD

01:04:24.293 --> 01:04:26.896
TO GO TO COURT. TO FIGHT THAT

01:04:26.963 --> 01:04:33.636
DECISION. AND WE LOST. AND THIS

01:04:33.703 --> 01:04:35.404
IS A PART OF A WHOLE SERIES OF

01:04:35.471 --> 01:04:37.406
PETITIONS THAT WE FILED TO

01:04:37.473 --> 01:04:38.007
CONVINCE THE STATE TO LET HIM

01:04:38.074 --> 01:04:41.544
GO AT THE TIME THE- THE

01:04:41.611 --> 01:04:43.512
GOVERNOR WAS NOT INTERESTED AND

01:04:43.579 --> 01:04:46.616
ALLOWING PEOPLE TO SHOW TO

01:04:46.682 --> 01:04:47.216
SHOW. WHO THEY WERE THEY'VE

01:04:47.283 --> 01:04:48.284
THERE'S A LOT OF FOCUS ON THE

01:04:48.351 --> 01:04:50.519
CRIME ITSELF AND NOT A LOT OF

01:04:50.586 --> 01:04:51.387
APPRECIATION FOR THE CAPACITY

01:04:51.454 --> 01:04:55.291
TO CHANGE- SO IT'S A PRIVILEGE

01:04:55.358 --> 01:04:56.626
REALLY AN HONOR TO BE SITTING

01:04:56.692 --> 01:04:58.961
WITH THOSE OUT NOW. NOT ONLY

01:04:59.028 --> 01:05:00.496
BECAUSE HE'S HOME WHERE HE

01:05:00.563 --> 01:05:03.499
NEEDS TO BE. UP BUT BECAUSE- IF

01:05:03.566 --> 01:05:05.735
HE'S RUNNING A PROGRAM IN WHICH

01:05:05.801 --> 01:05:07.737
TWO OF MY OTHER CLIENTS NOW.

01:05:07.803 --> 01:05:11.774
RESIDE TALK ABOUT FULL CIRCLE.

01:05:11.841 --> 01:05:14.243
BUT ALSO YOU KNOW THE MAN IT

01:05:14.310 --> 01:05:16.946
DID YOU YOU'LL HEAR FROM TODAY.

01:05:17.013 --> 01:05:19.949
HE WAS THAT GUY TEN YEARS AGO.

01:05:20.016 --> 01:05:21.584
AND WE AS A STATE DIDN'T

01:05:21.651 --> 01:05:22.718
RECOGNIZE HIS CAPACITY TO

01:05:22.785 --> 01:05:24.820
CHANGE AND WHO WE WAS FOR THE

01:05:24.887 --> 01:05:26.722
PEOPLE IN IN PRISON AND IN THE

01:05:26.789 --> 01:05:30.459
COMMUNITY- I'M I'M REALLY GLAD

01:05:30.526 --> 01:05:31.060
THAT THAT'S CHANGED WITH THEIR

01:05:31.127 --> 01:05:35.464
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE. BEHIND HIM

01:05:35.531 --> 01:05:37.300
WHO WERE IN THE SAME SITUATION

01:05:37.366 --> 01:05:38.901
AND SO I APPRECIATE THIS THIS

01:05:38.968 --> 01:05:40.102

A- GENERAL IDEA OF WHAT THOSE

01:28:29.704 --> 01:28:33.808
OVERALL COSTS ARE IN TERMS OF

01:28:33.875 --> 01:28:35.476
MAINTENANCE ONE FINAL QUESTION

DOLLAR FIGURE ALSO LEADS TO BE.

01:28:42.250 --> 01:28:46.621
CONSIDERED WHEN WE THINK ABOUT-

01:28:46.688 --> 01:28:48.289
WANT TO DRAW AN IMMEDIATE

01:28:48.356 --> 01:28:49.323
CORRELATION TO THE REDUCTION

01:28:49.390 --> 01:28:51.492
POPULATION AND YET WHY IS NOT

01:28:54.262 --> 01:28:55.496
EQUAL RIGHT THIS IS A PERFECT

01:28:55.563 --> 01:28:58.533
EXAMPLE OF WHY. BUT IF THE

01:28:58.599 --> 01:29:00.535
DEPARTMENT FINANCE LA- WHOEVER

01:29:00.601 --> 01:29:03.171
CHOOSES TO RESPOND COULD GIVE

01:29:03.237 --> 01:29:05.673
US A HIGH LEVEL SINCE OF WHAT

01:29:05.740 --> 01:29:08.042
SOME OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT

01:29:08.109 --> 01:29:10.144
COST DRIVERS ARE. TO THE BUDGET

01:29:10.211 --> 01:29:12.780
DESPITE THE POPULATION DECLINE

01:29:12.847 --> 01:29:14.348
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR PUTTING

01:29:14.415 --> 01:29:15.917
IN CONTEXT THE WHEN WE TALK

01:29:15.983 --> 01:29:17.819
ABOUT DEBT REDUCTION ALL BIDS

01:29:17.885 --> 01:29:19.487
ON THE SAYING. FIVE PRE SHEET

01:29:19.554 --> 01:29:21.222
THAT BUT IF YOU COULD JUST GIVE

01:29:21.289 --> 01:29:23.324
US A HIGH LEVEL. UNDERSTANDING

01:29:23.391 --> 01:29:24.892
OF WHAT SOME OF THOSE COSTS

01:29:24.959 --> 01:29:27.528
DRIVERS ARE TO HELP EDUCATE THE

01:29:27.595 --> 01:29:28.930
COMMITTEE AS A WHOLE AND OUR

01:29:28.996 --> 01:29:30.965
MEMBERSHIP AT THE DID SENATE AS

01:29:31.032 --> 01:29:34.235
A WHOLE SO WE STOP. WITH THAT

01:29:34.302 --> 01:29:35.837
RATHER YOU KNOW KIND OF SOFT

01:29:35.903 --> 01:29:38.272
MORE ARITHMETIC GAME IF WE'RE

01:29:38.339 --> 01:29:39.440
DOWN BY FIVE PEOPLE THEN WE

01:29:39.507 --> 01:29:41.909
SHOULD BE DOWN BY 5% IT IS NOT

01:29:41.976 --> 01:29:43.411
THAT SIMPLE SO TALK TO US ABOUT

01:29:43.478 --> 01:29:45.079
SOME OF THE COST DRIVERS PLEASE

01:29:45.146 --> 01:29:47.415
I THINK- I'LL SPEAK I'LL TAKE A

01:29:47.482 --> 01:29:48.783
STAB AT AND I THINK THE THINGS

01:29:48.850 --> 01:29:50.151
THAT I'M VERY FAMILIAR WITH. IS

01:29:50.218 --> 01:29:51.319
THE FIRST ONE IS THE HEALTH

01:29:51.385 --> 01:29:52.620
CARE MENTAL HEALTH COSTS AND

01:29:52.687 --> 01:29:55.356
HAVE RISEN WITH THE DEPARTMENT.

01:29:55.423 --> 01:29:57.525
THAT HAVE BEEN AS A RESULT OF-

01:29:57.592 --> 01:29:59.660
COURT ORDERS BUT EVEN BEYOND

01:29:59.727 --> 01:30:00.795
THE COURT OR JUST DOING THE

01:30:00.862 --> 01:30:02.130
RIGHT THING FOR THE POPULATION.

01:30:02.196 --> 01:30:03.731
SO THAT THAT IS ONE OF THE MAIN

01:30:03.798 --> 01:30:05.500
DRIVERS- ONE OF THE SECOND

01:30:05.566 --> 01:30:07.435
PIECE IS EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION

01:30:07.502 --> 01:30:09.637
AND BENEFITS- THEY HAVE GONE

01:30:09.704 --> 01:30:12.673
UP- AND I DO GET QUESTIONED I

01:30:12.740 --> 01:30:14.275
WAS QUESTION IN THE LA TIMES

01:30:14.342 --> 01:30:15.676
ARTICLE LAST YEAR WHEN A

01:30:15.743 --> 01:30:17.145
PARTICULAR BY UNIT GOT A RAISE

01:30:17.211 --> 01:30:18.913
IN THE **** DO YOU SECRETARY

01:30:18.980 --> 01:30:20.014
BELIEVE THAT THEY DESERVED A

01:30:20.081 --> 01:30:22.583
RAISE AND THAT'S KIND OF A

01:30:22.650 --> 01:30:23.851
LOADED QUESTION. NO WAY

01:30:23.918 --> 01:30:25.653
RESPONDED WAS AT I DEMAND OF MY

01:30:25.720 --> 01:30:26.888
EMPLOYEES AND THEY DO A JOB

01:30:26.954 --> 01:30:28.322
THAT MANY STONE MANY PEOPLE

01:30:28.389 --> 01:30:30.158
CAN'T OR WON'T DO. SO I DO

01:30:30.224 --> 01:30:31.292
DEMAND A LOT SO THAT'S A

01:30:31.359 --> 01:30:33.027
RELATIVE QUESTION. SO I DO

01:30:33.094 --> 01:30:33.928
BELIEVE THEY DESERVE THE

01:30:33.995 --> 01:30:35.663
COMPENSATION THEY'RE GETTING.

01:30:35.730 --> 01:30:37.298
SO THAT THAT'S BEEN ANOTHER

01:30:37.365 --> 01:30:40.668
DRIVER AND- THE THIRD DRIVER-

01:30:40.735 --> 01:30:44.071
REALLY HAS COME FROM- YOU KNOW

01:30:44.138 --> 01:30:45.473
THE REHABILITATIVE PROGRAM

01:30:45.540 --> 01:30:46.874
EXPANSIONS THAT WE HAVE

01:30:46.941 --> 01:30:49.177
INVESTED IN. AND THESE ARE

01:30:49.243 --> 01:30:50.745
INVESTMENT DOLLARS US WAY LOOK

01:30:50.812 --> 01:30:52.213
AT THEM. AS WE'VE ALREADY HEARD

01:30:52.280 --> 01:30:53.948
FROM PRIOR PANELS IN THE LAST

01:30:54.015 --> 01:30:55.316
PANEL. THESE ARE INVESTMENT

01:30:55.383 --> 01:30:57.185
DOLLARS AT AS WE HAVE GROWN A

01:30:57.251 --> 01:30:58.886
REHABILITATIVE CATALOG AND

01:30:58.953 --> 01:31:00.788
PORTFOLIO. WE LEARNED ALONG THE

01:31:00.855 --> 01:31:03.658
WAY. AND WE WERE TRYING TO BE A

01:31:03.724 --> 01:31:06.627
DYNAMIC. REHABILITATIVE AGENCY

01:31:06.694 --> 01:31:08.262
NOT JUST GOING BY THE OLD WAYS

01:31:08.329 --> 01:31:10.064
OF DOING BUSINESS IS SOMETHING

01:31:10.131 --> 01:31:10.698
WORK FIVE YEARS AGO THAT MEANS

01:31:10.765 --> 01:31:11.966
IT'S GOING TO WORK THE NEXT

01:31:12.033 --> 01:31:12.667
FIFTEEN YEARS THAT'S NOT THE

01:31:12.733 --> 01:31:14.202
CASE. BECAUSE WE HAVE NEW

01:31:14.268 --> 01:31:16.003
POPULATIONS IN NEW AGES AND

01:31:16.070 --> 01:31:17.038
DEMOGRAPHICS COME IN

01:31:17.104 --> 01:31:18.639
INSTITUTIONS WITH NEW NEEDS AND

01:31:18.706 --> 01:31:20.441
WE HAVE TO. MEET THE MORE THE

01:31:20.508 --> 01:31:21.542
RAT WITH THE CURRENT NEEDS SO

01:31:21.609 --> 01:31:22.977
EVERYTHING FROM THE COGNITIVE

01:31:23.044 --> 01:31:27.081
BEHAVIOR- ADVANCEMENTS TO- WHAT

01:31:27.148 --> 01:31:28.783
I CALL SOME MORE COMMUNITY

01:31:28.850 --> 01:31:29.884

01:31:29.951 --> 01:31:32.086
TIMES WE GET. I GET ASKED YOU

01:31:32.153 --> 01:31:33.921
KNOW THE EVIDENCE BASE WHICH IS

01:31:33.988 --> 01:31:35.189
A VERY VALID QUESTION BUT I

01:31:35.256 --> 01:31:36.357
ALWAYS LOOK AT THOSE AS THESE

01:31:36.424 --> 01:31:38.659
ARE PROGRAMS THAT COME IN THEIR

01:31:38.726 --> 01:31:41.229

AND STOP AND- TOWARDS A MORE

01:31:42.129 --> 01:31:45.633
EVIDENCE BASED. PROGRAM WHERE

01:31:45.700 --> 01:31:47.068
THEY HAVE TO ACHIEVE MILESTONES

01:31:47.134 --> 01:31:48.202
IN THAT THEY HAVE TO TAKE

01:31:48.269 --> 01:31:49.837
EXAMINATIONS AND THAT THE

01:31:49.904 --> 01:31:51.906
PROOF. THAT THEY HAVE LEARNED

01:31:51.973 --> 01:31:54.242
CONCEPTS AND THAT THE HOW THE

01:31:54.308 --> 01:31:57.645
DEPARTMENT TO THE LIFE TO LIVES.

01:31:57.712 --> 01:32:01.449
SO ARE WE- PORTFOLIO CATALOG IS

01:32:01.515 --> 01:32:02.483
TO HAVE TO EXPAND YEARS. WE

01:32:02.550 --> 01:32:04.485
HAVE A MORE SERIOUS INVITE. POP

01:32:04.552 --> 01:32:05.720
THAT WE HAD IN YOUR- BECAUSE

01:32:05.786 --> 01:32:16.130
THAT'S WHAT SENT US. AS WE WERE

01:32:16.197 --> 01:32:19.267
YOUNGER PA. COME TO US ONE OF

01:32:19.333 --> 01:32:20.701
THE BUDGET I JUST FOR A- IF.

01:32:20.768 --> 01:32:22.603
FOR EXT. AT VALLEY STAY PRISON

01:32:22.670 --> 01:32:23.471
AND THAT'S FOR INDIVIDUAL

01:32:23.537 --> 01:32:25.706
CENTERS FROM NINE. TWENTY

01:32:25.773 --> 01:32:26.307
EIGHTEEN TWENTY TWO YEARS AND

01:32:26.374 --> 01:32:27.308
RIGHT NOW THERE'S A LITTLE

01:32:27.375 --> 01:32:27.975
SEVEN. OF THOSE INTO. THE RIGHT

01:32:28.042 --> 01:32:28.843
NOW IN A PRISON SYSTEM IN MADE

01:32:28.910 --> 01:32:31.512
AGE AGES FOR EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY

01:32:31.579 --> 01:32:32.680
THERE'S OVER TEN THOUSAND.

01:32:32.747 --> 01:32:33.514
THAT'S A OF YOUNG PEOPLE OUR

01:32:33.581 --> 01:32:36.517
ANSWER. HAVE SEE THE IN MY THE

01:32:36.584 --> 01:32:39.086
YEARS I STARTED A ONE OF AGE. I

01:32:39.153 --> 01:32:39.720
SEEN IN MAYES COMING AT TWO ONE

01:32:39.787 --> 01:32:42.490
TWO NOW THERE YEARS OLD LIKE ME.

01:32:42.556 --> 01:32:43.958
AND I JUST THINK IF WE WERE

01:32:44.025 --> 01:32:45.559
ABLE TO REACH SOMEONE I BEGAN

01:32:45.626 --> 01:32:46.327
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A DIFFERENT

01:32:46.394 --> 01:32:47.929
OUTCOME. THEY WOULDN'T HAVE TO

01:32:47.995 --> 01:32:49.463
HAVE GONE THROUGH. SOME OF THE

01:32:49.530 --> 01:32:51.065
VIOLENT INCIDENTS THAT OCCUR IN

01:32:51.132 --> 01:32:52.533
THE DAYS OF OLD IN PRISON WE DO

01:32:52.600 --> 01:32:54.702
HAVE ISLAND INCIDENT STILL. BUT

01:32:54.769 --> 01:32:57.038
I THINK IF WE REACH THEM- WITH-

01:32:57.104 --> 01:33:01.075
WITH THE MORE- INFORMED AND A

01:33:01.142 --> 01:33:03.611
MORE. COGNIZANT WAY OF REACHING

THEM IN WHATEVER THEIR NEEDS

01:33:04.712 --> 01:33:06.047
ARE SO I THINK THE THIRD ONE IS

01:33:06.113 --> 01:33:08.883
A REHABILITATIVE EFFORTS. THANK

01:33:17.391 --> 01:33:19.193
INCREASED BY OVER THREE BILLION

01:33:19.260 --> 01:33:20.227
WHEN THE INMATE POPULATION

01:33:20.294 --> 01:33:21.696

01:34:02.603 --> 01:34:03.904
FACILITIES SO WE'RE ACTUALLY.

01:34:03.971 --> 01:34:05.873
DESPITE THE POPULATION DECLINE

01:34:05.940 --> 01:34:07.508
OPERATING MORE FACILITIES THAN

01:34:07.575 --> 01:34:09.043
WE WERE BEFORE SAYS OVERHEAD

01:34:09.110 --> 01:34:12.013
COSTS OF HAVE. AN INCREASED AND

01:34:12.079 --> 01:34:14.015
STAFFING COSTS- IT WE'VE ALSO

01:34:14.081 --> 01:34:17.218
HAD TO COMPLY- WITH OR COURT

01:34:17.284 --> 01:34:19.186
ORDERS RELATED TO EXPANDING IN

01:34:19.253 --> 01:34:20.287
MADE HEALTH CARE WHICH HAS BEEN

01:34:20.354 --> 01:34:27.595
QUITE COSTLY- AND SO. WHILE THE

01:34:27.661 --> 01:34:29.130
STAFFING LEVELS DID DECLINE

01:34:29.196 --> 01:34:31.065
OVERALL STAFF DID TO SOMEONE. A

01:34:31.132 --> 01:34:32.833
REALIGN YOU KNOW FOR PERHAPS

01:34:32.900 --> 01:34:34.168
FROM THINGS LIKE NOT HAVING TO

01:34:34.235 --> 01:34:37.471
OPERATE- GYMNASIUMS AS HOUSING

01:34:37.538 --> 01:34:40.174
UNITS AND- THE PRO POPULATION

01:34:40.241 --> 01:34:41.609
DECLINE ALSO WOULD HAVE COSTS

01:34:41.675 --> 01:34:43.644
AND STAFFING INCLINED- THESE

01:34:43.711 --> 01:34:45.780
FACTORS SUCH AS- A- ACTIVATING

01:34:45.846 --> 01:34:47.715
ADDITIONAL CAPACITY AND

01:34:47.782 --> 01:34:48.849
SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDING HEALTH

01:34:48.916 --> 01:34:50.751
CARE STAFF IN PARTICULAR HAVE.

01:34:50.818 --> 01:34:52.319
BECAUSE THE NUMBER OF STAFF TO

01:34:52.386 --> 01:34:53.854
RETURN TO ROUGHLY PRE LINE

01:34:53.921 --> 01:34:56.524
REALIGNMENT LEVELS- THE SECOND

01:34:56.590 --> 01:34:59.160
ISSUE A SECOND MAJOR DRIVER AND

01:34:59.226 --> 01:35:00.394
IS EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION SO

01:35:00.461 --> 01:35:02.696
EVEN. THOUGH THAT WERE AT THE

01:35:02.763 --> 01:35:04.999
SAME ROUGHLY SAME- STAFFING

01:35:05.066 --> 01:35:06.400
LEVEL AS WE WERE PRE ALIGN

01:35:06.467 --> 01:35:08.836
REALIGNMENT- WE'RE SPENDING

01:35:08.903 --> 01:35:12.807
SIGNIFICANTLY MORE. THE COST

01:35:12.873 --> 01:35:15.076
PER EMPLOYEE HAS INCREASED BY

01:35:15.142 --> 01:35:16.844
43% SINCE THREE PRE

01:35:16.911 --> 01:35:19.113
REALIGNMENT- THAT'S DOUBLE THE

01:35:19.180 --> 01:35:22.149
RATE OF INFLATION- THAT'S-

01:35:22.216 --> 01:35:24.485
MAINLY BEAT FOR TWO REASONS-

01:35:24.552 --> 01:35:26.353
THAT WE IDENTIFIED. AND THAT IS

01:35:26.420 --> 01:35:27.855
THAT AG PENSION CONTRIBUTION

01:35:27.922 --> 01:35:29.290
RATES INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY

01:35:29.356 --> 01:35:30.458
THOSE ARE SET BY THE CALPERS

01:35:30.524 --> 01:35:32.493
BOARD AND WE'RE INCREASED-

01:35:32.560 --> 01:35:34.962
RELATED TO- IN ORDER TO PAY FOR

01:35:35.029 --> 01:35:36.330
UNFUNDED LIABILITIES THAT GREW

01:35:36.397 --> 01:35:38.399
DURING THE GREAT RECESSION. AND

01:35:38.466 --> 01:35:41.135
THEN ALSO SALARY GROWTH OF-

01:35:41.202 --> 01:35:43.204
CITIES ARE STAFF GREW. AS

01:35:43.270 --> 01:35:44.438
SIGNIFICANTLY OVER THE LAST TEN

01:35:44.505 --> 01:35:46.040
YEARS AND THEN THE THIRD

01:35:46.107 --> 01:35:48.709
FACTORY IDENTIFIED WAS- AS YOU

01:35:48.776 --> 01:35:49.977
ALLUDED TO EARLIER HAT WE DID

01:35:50.044 --> 01:35:53.481
THE STATE DID- AS A WAY TO- GET

01:35:53.547 --> 01:35:55.282
THROUGH TO THE GREAT. RISK IN

01:35:55.349 --> 01:35:56.350
THE FISCAL CRISIS THE STATE

01:35:56.417 --> 01:35:59.120
DID- SHIFT COSTS FROM THOSE

01:35:59.186 --> 01:36:01.689
EARLY YEARS AROUND THE ERROR OF

01:36:01.755 --> 01:36:03.524
THE TIME A REALIGNMENT TO LATER

01:36:03.591 --> 01:36:06.594
YEARS SO- A BIG EXAMPLE OF THAT

01:36:06.660 --> 01:36:08.596
IS FOR ALLOWING OF CORRECTIONAL

01:36:08.662 --> 01:36:11.899
OFFICERS SO- WHEN WE- ASK FOR

01:36:11.966 --> 01:36:13.000
FURLOUGHS WHEN WE FOR LOW

01:36:13.067 --> 01:36:14.168
CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS WE STILL

01:36:14.235 --> 01:36:16.504
HAVE TO. GUARD THE PRISONS SO-

01:36:16.570 --> 01:36:18.139
ESSENTIALLY WE GIVE OFFICERS

01:36:18.205 --> 01:36:20.474
INCREASE LEAVE TIME IN EXCHANGE

01:36:20.541 --> 01:36:22.743
FOR REDUCED PAY AND SO THAT

01:36:22.810 --> 01:36:24.545
SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE OFFICERS

01:36:24.612 --> 01:36:27.114
LEAVE BALANCES DURING THE- THE

01:36:27.181 --> 01:36:29.150
FISCAL CRISIS- WHICH

01:36:29.216 --> 01:36:30.818
ARTIFICIALLY THIS ARTIFICIALLY

01:36:30.885 --> 01:36:32.419
REDUCED CITY SIR EXPENDITURES

01:36:32.486 --> 01:36:34.121
IN THE EARLY YEARS. AND NOW

01:36:34.188 --> 01:36:34.822
IT'S THOSE OFFICERS ARE

01:36:34.889 --> 01:36:36.657
RETIRING WERE CATCHING THAT OUT

01:36:36.724 --> 01:36:38.159
WE'RE PAYING FOR OVERTIME TO

01:36:38.225 --> 01:36:38.659
BACKFILL WHEN THEY TAKE

01:36:38.726 --> 01:36:40.961
VACATION SO THAT ARTIFICIALLY

01:36:41.028 --> 01:36:42.296
INCREASING EXPENDITURES IN

01:36:42.363 --> 01:36:43.864
LATER YEARS SO IT'S REALLY ALSO

01:36:43.931 --> 01:36:46.033
IN SOME WAYS NOT AN APPLES TO

01:36:46.100 --> 01:36:46.734
APPLES TO LOOK AT WHEN THE

01:36:46.800 --> 01:36:48.068
STATE WAS IN RECESS THE

01:36:48.135 --> 01:36:50.905
RECESSION VERSES. LATER SO AND

01:36:50.971 --> 01:36:52.373
THEN FINALLY I WOULD JUST NOTE

01:36:52.439 --> 01:36:54.675
THAT- HAD THE INMATE POPULATION

01:36:54.742 --> 01:36:56.277
NOT DECLINE IN THE IT SING BY

01:36:56.343 --> 01:36:57.878
THE SIGNIFICAN MOUNT THAT WE

01:36:57.945 --> 01:37:00.447
HAVE SEEN OVER THE LAST DECADE-

01:37:00.514 --> 01:37:01.916
THE STATE WOULD HAVE NOT ONLY

01:37:01.982 --> 01:37:03.617
WILL HAVE LESS LIKELY VERY LOW

01:37:03.684 --> 01:37:05.119
WOULD HAVE HAD TO IN ORDER TO

01:37:05.186 --> 01:37:06.654
COMPLY ITH THAT. OVERCROWDING

01:37:06.720 --> 01:37:07.855
ORDER WOULD HAVE HAD TO

01:37:07.922 --> 01:37:09.490
CONTRACT FOR SAY A

01:37:09.557 --> 01:37:13.027
SUBSTANTIALLY MORE CAPACITY AND

01:37:13.093 --> 01:37:15.729
OR BUILD POTENTIALLY SOME

01:37:15.796 --> 01:37:18.299
PRISONS WOULD HAVE HAD. MAKE

01:37:18.365 --> 01:37:19.466
YOU KNOW ENSURE HELL CARE FOR

01:37:19.533 --> 01:37:20.167
EVEN IN MADE WHICH WOULD HAVE

01:37:20.234 --> 01:37:21.068
BEEN E. MORE CA. AND WE COULD

01:37:21.135 --> 01:37:23.304
BE SPENDING- BILLIONS OF

01:37:23.370 --> 01:37:25.573
POTENTIALLY OF DOLLARS MORE NOW

01:37:25.639 --> 01:37:27.408
THAN WE ARE. TODAY SO WE'RE

01:37:27.474 --> 01:37:31.812
STILL SAVING IN THAT SENSE.

01:37:31.879 --> 01:37:37.551
THANK YOU THAT WAS VERY HELPFUL.

01:37:37.618 --> 01:37:39.186
ANY OTHER COMMENTS BEFORE WE

01:37:39.253 --> 01:37:40.387
ARE A TURN OVER DECISION

01:37:40.454 --> 01:37:42.189
NIELSEN THANK YOU FOR THAT SIR

01:37:42.256 --> 01:37:45.025
TO NIELSEN. THANK YOU MADAM

01:37:45.092 --> 01:37:47.428
CHAIR AND BEFORE I. GO UNDER

01:37:47.494 --> 01:37:48.462
THE DIGITAL QUESTIONS I'D LIKE

01:37:48.529 --> 01:37:50.297
TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF

01:37:50.364 --> 01:37:53.234
HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE. ON THE

01:37:53.300 --> 01:37:55.336
DRIVING FACTORS WHICH RELATED

01:37:55.402 --> 01:37:58.239
TO THE INMATE LAWSUITS. AND

01:37:58.305 --> 01:38:00.708
I'M- IMPLICATING PREVIOUS

01:38:00.774 --> 01:38:02.977
ADMINISTRATIONS DEMOCRAT AND

01:38:03.043 --> 01:38:04.745
REPUBLICAN AND LEGISLATURE'S

01:38:04.812 --> 01:38:09.350
RATING WAY BACK. THAT THE

01:38:09.416 --> 01:38:15.623
ORIGINAL LAWSUIT. WE'RE NOT

01:38:15.689 --> 01:38:16.624
NEARLY AS ONEROUS. AND HAD THE

01:38:16.690 --> 01:38:18.459
STATE ACTED PRO ACTIVELY THOSE

01:38:18.525 --> 01:38:22.096
AND GOES BACK TO THE- LATE

01:38:22.162 --> 01:38:23.364
EIGHTIES THE PARTICULAR THROUGH

01:38:23.430 --> 01:38:27.268
NIGHT. THE LAWSUITS WOULD NEVER

01:38:27.334 --> 01:38:30.204
BE WHAT THEY ARE TODAY. BUT THE

01:38:30.271 --> 01:38:33.874
STATE DID NOT ACT PRO ACTIVELY.

01:38:33.941 --> 01:38:37.111
AND SO THE FINAL TWELVE SWOOP

01:38:37.177 --> 01:38:38.779
WITH THE FEDERAL COURTS GETTING

01:38:38.846 --> 01:38:41.482
FRUSTRATED SAYING LOOK YOU'RE

01:38:41.548 --> 01:38:42.116
NOT GOING TO DO IT WE WILL TAKE

01:38:42.182 --> 01:38:45.919
OVER. SO THE PREMIUM IS ON

01:38:45.986 --> 01:38:49.223
BEING MORE PROACTIVE. HERE THE

01:38:49.290 --> 01:38:53.794
CHALLENGE OF OUR TIMES. WHEN I

01:38:53.861 --> 01:38:56.330
BECAME CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF

01:38:56.397 --> 01:38:58.632
PRISON TERMS MANY YEARS AGO.

01:38:58.699 --> 01:38:59.366
ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS I

01:38:59.433 --> 01:39:02.102
LEARNED IS IT. REHABILITATION

01:39:02.169 --> 01:39:03.203
IN THE INSTITUTION WITHIN AN

01:39:03.270 --> 01:39:06.640
ADEQUATE. AND I COULDN'T REALLY

01:39:06.707 --> 01:39:08.275
COUNT ON THAT B. AND A HUGE

01:39:08.342 --> 01:39:11.211
FACTOR IN THE REHABILITATION OF

01:39:11.278 --> 01:39:13.480
ANY PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL.

01:39:13.547 --> 01:39:14.948
BECAUSE IT WAS INADEQUATE IN

01:39:15.015 --> 01:39:18.185
PART BECAUSE- NOBODY EVER PAID

01:39:18.252 --> 01:39:19.586
ANY ATTENTION TO TRACK TO SEE

01:39:19.653 --> 01:39:20.888
WHAT'S GOING ON WITHIN THOSE

01:39:20.954 --> 01:39:22.623
PROGRAMS AND I THINK THE

01:39:22.690 --> 01:39:23.657
SECRETARY REFERRED TO A LITTLE

01:39:23.724 --> 01:39:26.694
BIT AGO. IT ISN'T JUST THAT YOU

01:39:26.760 --> 01:39:28.228
WENT TO A OR IN A OR BREAKING

01:39:28.295 --> 01:39:30.364
BARRIERS OR WHATEVER. DID YOU

01:39:30.431 --> 01:39:32.800
INTERNALIZE IT COULD YOU TAKE

01:39:32.866 --> 01:39:37.671
THAT ON YOURSELF. AND APPLY IT.

01:39:37.738 --> 01:39:38.839
IN I HAD WANTED YOU TO FROM THE

01:39:38.906 --> 01:39:40.474
MOMENT JUST A FEW MONTHS AGO I

01:39:40.541 --> 01:39:42.710
RAN INTO A MAN AND A CHAMBER OF

01:39:42.776 --> 01:39:44.311
COMMERCE THINGS IN STORE

01:39:44.378 --> 01:39:46.113
SACRAMENTO THE CAME UP TO ME

01:39:46.180 --> 01:39:47.981
SAID YOU KNOW YOU CHANGE MY

01:39:48.048 --> 01:39:49.616
WHOLE LIFE THE CENTER I'M SORRY

01:39:49.683 --> 01:39:52.419
I DON'T KNOW HOW. YOU CHAIRED

01:39:52.486 --> 01:39:54.388
MY PAROLE HEARING. THEN YOU DID

01:39:54.455 --> 01:39:57.791
NOT FIND THE SUITABLE. BUT YOU

01:39:57.858 --> 01:39:59.226
TOLD ME WHAT I NEEDED TO DO. TO

01:39:59.293 --> 01:40:01.862
BE FOUND SUITABLE. THEN I GOT A

01:40:01.929 --> 01:40:06.667
COPY OF DECISION. IN A CAPITA.

01:40:06.734 --> 01:40:10.337
AND A LEARN BY. IN ANY EXTOLLED

01:40:10.404 --> 01:40:12.673
THE VIRTUES AND WHAT NEW NOW

01:40:12.740 --> 01:40:15.476
DEL ARE TELLING US HERE TODAY

01:40:15.542 --> 01:40:16.577
YOU WANT TO PAY ATTENTION TO

01:40:16.643 --> 01:40:19.747
BUSINESS AND YOU DID ANY CHANGE.

01:40:19.813 --> 01:40:21.782
I MY POINT IS THAT WITHIN OUR

01:40:21.849 --> 01:40:23.450
INSTITUTIONS WE NEED TO DO A

01:40:23.517 --> 01:40:25.419
LOT BETTER JOB OF FOLLOWING THE

01:40:25.486 --> 01:40:26.820
INDIVIDUAL THROUGH THEIR

01:40:26.887 --> 01:40:29.022
TREATMENT REGIMENS. TO SEE IF

01:40:29.089 --> 01:40:32.226
THEY DO THEIR JOB. I WANNA

THANK SECTOR DS AS WELL IT'S

01:40:34.395 --> 01:40:35.696
BEEN MY PLEASURE TO WORK WITH

BEGAN ON THE- ON THAT AS A

01:40:40.601 --> 01:40:43.036
SECRETARY THERE. AND IT'S

01:40:43.103 --> 01:40:47.775
TOUGHEST JOB IN GOVERNMENT. FOR

01:40:47.841 --> 01:40:50.077
THE AGENCY PEOPLE. THE PORTAL

01:40:50.144 --> 01:40:52.546
IN THE INSTITUTION. AND IT'S

01:40:52.613 --> 01:40:54.081
PRETTY TOUGH JOB FOR THE

01:40:54.148 --> 01:40:56.350
INMATES TO. WHEN I'VE HAD

01:40:56.417 --> 01:40:58.919
PEOPLE TELL ME OVER THE YEARS-

01:40:58.986 --> 01:40:59.720
THEY HAVE THAT'S A COUNTRY CLUB

01:40:59.787 --> 01:41:01.088
ALL THEY DO IS WATCH TV AND GET

01:41:01.155 --> 01:41:03.657
THEIR THREE SQUARES. WELL I

01:41:03.724 --> 01:41:04.291
SAID THAT'S NOT A CUT CLUB YOU

01:41:04.358 --> 01:41:07.828

YOU LEAVE. PRESS ARE NOT

01:41:18.005 --> 01:41:21.475
COUNTRY CLUB. AND THE ISSUE OF

01:41:21.542 --> 01:41:24.144
PERSONNEL WHO WORK THERE IN.

01:41:24.211 --> 01:41:26.547
WHAT MY GREATEST CONCERNS. WITH

01:41:26.613 --> 01:41:29.783
THE PEOPLE IN MY EMPLOY. WASN'T

01:41:29.850 --> 01:41:32.586
TAKEN AT HOME. THEN I LEARNED

01:41:32.653 --> 01:41:34.254
HOW TO SEE WHEN THEY WERE TAKEN

01:41:34.321 --> 01:41:37.057

AND TRY TO WORK THEM SO THAT

01:41:47.034 --> 01:41:49.303
THEY COULD CALL. THAT IS A VERY

01:41:49.369 --> 01:41:51.004
DIFFICULT AND IT IS CALLED BY

01:41:51.071 --> 01:41:52.172
CORRECTING PIECE OFF TO THE

01:41:52.239 --> 01:41:53.307
TOUGHEST BEAT FOLKS IT IS THE

01:41:53.373 --> 01:41:55.843
TOUGHEST BEAT. THEY GET

01:41:55.909 --> 01:41:59.079
CRITICIZED AN AWFUL LOT. IT IS

01:41:59.146 --> 01:42:03.016
THE TOUGHEST BEAT. AND WE NEED

01:42:03.083 --> 01:42:05.986
TO DO WHATEVER WE CAN. TO MAKE

01:42:06.053 --> 01:42:07.354
THE INSTITUTIONS BETTER FOR THE

01:42:07.421 --> 01:42:09.756
INDIVIDUAL DARIAN AND TO ENSURE

01:42:09.823 --> 01:42:11.992
THE REHABILITATIVE. PURPOSE AND

01:42:12.059 --> 01:42:16.163
MISSION. IS EFFECTIVE BUT LET

01:42:16.230 --> 01:42:18.499
US NOT FORGET AS WELL THOUGH

01:42:18.565 --> 01:42:20.267
INSTITUTIONS ARE ALL FOR

01:42:20.334 --> 01:42:23.203
PUNISHMENT AS WELL. BUT THE

01:42:23.270 --> 01:42:25.973
BIGGEST ELEMENT OF THE SYSTEM.

01:42:26.039 --> 01:42:29.843
THIS JUSTICE. JUSTICE FOR THOSE

01:42:29.910 --> 01:42:30.978
WHO HAVE BEEN CONVICTED AND ARE

01:42:31.044 --> 01:42:34.381
YOU IN THEIR TIME. AND JUSTICE

01:42:34.448 --> 01:42:36.950
FOR CRIME VICTIMS. NOW OF LATE

01:42:37.017 --> 01:42:39.219
EVEN IN THIS BUILDING CRIME

01:42:39.286 --> 01:42:39.720
VICTIMS ARE PRETTY WELL

01:42:39.786 --> 01:42:42.523
IGNORED. FACTORY BEEN REDEFINED

01:42:42.589 --> 01:42:45.325
WHO THEY ARE. THAT DOES CONCERN

01:42:45.392 --> 01:42:50.564
ME. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

01:42:50.631 --> 01:42:52.766
YOU LOOK AT IN A THE- IS THERE

01:42:52.833 --> 01:42:55.035
IN REMORSE. ARE THEY CAPABLE OF

01:42:55.102 --> 01:42:58.071
FOR THEM SO IN THE SHOES. OF

01:42:58.138 --> 01:42:59.873
THE PEOPLE THE BASED OF WHAT

01:42:59.940 --> 01:43:04.978
THE DEBT. MANY CAN. AND ONE OF

01:43:05.045 --> 01:43:05.779
THE THINGS THAT MUST REALLY

01:43:05.846 --> 01:43:08.448
EMPHASIZE IS EARLY INTERVENTION

01:43:08.515 --> 01:43:11.518
BROKEN WINDOW THEORY. I CAN'T

01:43:11.585 --> 01:43:13.053
TELL YOU HOW IN HOW MANY

01:43:13.120 --> 01:43:16.123
PAROLEES TO DEATH ROW INMATES.

01:43:16.189 --> 01:43:17.524
THAT I'M QUITE IT WITH THEIR

01:43:17.591 --> 01:43:20.727
LIFE HISTORIES. AND A WHIP IN

01:43:20.794 --> 01:43:21.962
MY HEART FOR THE CHILD THEY

01:43:22.029 --> 01:43:27.334
WERE. DIDN'T HAVE A CHANCE. BUT

01:43:27.401 --> 01:43:28.769
I HAVE TO HOLD ACCOUNTABLE FOR

01:43:28.835 --> 01:43:29.636
CONSEQUENCES THINGS HE DID

01:43:29.703 --> 01:43:32.906
LATER ON. BUT ONE OF THE THINGS

01:43:32.973 --> 01:43:35.042
WE HAVE TO FOCUS ON A SOCIETY

01:43:35.108 --> 01:43:37.644
IS OUR FAMILY. THE

01:43:37.711 --> 01:43:39.413
STRENGTHENING OF FAMILIES. IN

01:43:39.479 --> 01:43:42.583
THE ROLE THE PARENTS IN THOSE

01:43:42.649 --> 01:43:45.953
FAMILIES. AND I KNOW THAT MAKES

01:43:46.019 --> 01:43:49.022
A DIFFERENCE. THERE WAS ALWAYS

01:43:49.089 --> 01:43:50.190
A DELIGHT WHEN YOU WOULD SEE

01:43:50.257 --> 01:43:52.326
THE BLACK GOAL OFTEN SOMEBODY'S

01:43:52.392 --> 01:43:57.764
EYES AND THEY THEY GOT IT. WELL

01:43:57.831 --> 01:43:59.166
ENOUGH OF THAT PROTECTED THE AS

01:43:59.232 --> 01:44:01.301
I WANT TO ALSO YOU FOR

01:44:01.368 --> 01:44:03.904
COOPERATING WITH SOMETHING THAT

01:44:03.971 --> 01:44:04.504
I THINK IS INSTRUCTED MAYBE TO

01:44:04.571 --> 01:44:07.474
THE- BOARD HERE'S- THE

01:44:07.541 --> 01:44:10.277
COMMITTEE. YOUR AGENCY HAS

01:44:10.344 --> 01:44:12.512
COOPERATED WITH ME FOR SOME

01:44:12.579 --> 01:44:13.947
TWENTY YEARS CONDUCTING A

01:44:14.014 --> 01:44:15.949
SEMINAR ON THE DEATH PENALTY AT

01:44:16.016 --> 01:44:18.051
SAN QUENTIN EVERYYEAR FOR THE

01:44:18.118 --> 01:44:20.220
EGG LEADERSHIP PROGRAM WHICH IS

01:44:20.287 --> 01:44:20.821
A FELLOWSHIP FOR ABOUT THIRTY

01:44:20.887 --> 01:44:26.126
FARMERS. MY EXPERIENCE IN

01:44:26.193 --> 01:44:26.960
DEALING WITH THE DEATH PENALTY

01:44:27.027 --> 01:44:28.128
IS I HAD TO DIRECTLY TO TEN

01:44:28.195 --> 01:44:33.166
TIMES. IS THIS IS A VERY GRAVE

01:44:33.233 --> 01:44:34.935
AND HEAVY ISSUE ALWAYS A PUBLIC

01:44:35.002 --> 01:44:36.903
POLICY ISSUE IT EBBS AND FLOWS

01:44:36.970 --> 01:44:39.573
IT'LL ALWAYS BE THERE. BUT I

01:44:39.640 --> 01:44:41.675
HAVE DECIDED TO CONDUCT THIS AS

01:44:41.742 --> 01:44:45.812
THE SEMINAR FOR THESE FELLOWS.

01:44:45.879 --> 01:44:47.214
AND WE BEGIN I TELL IN THIS IS

01:44:47.280 --> 01:44:48.515
NOT ABOUT THE DEATH PENALTY

01:44:48.582 --> 01:44:49.383
IT'S LIKE YOU COMING HERE TO

01:44:49.449 --> 01:44:50.651
HEAR ABOUT THE DEATH PENALTY

01:44:50.717 --> 01:44:52.085
THEY WE HAVE PEOPLE SPEAK FOR

01:44:52.152 --> 01:44:53.754
AGAINST. HIM HAD A DEATH ROW

01:44:53.820 --> 01:44:56.423
INMATE FROM. OKLAHOMA WAS

01:44:56.490 --> 01:44:57.658
WRONGFULLY CONVICTED. CAME AND

01:44:57.724 --> 01:45:00.060
SPOKE SEVERAL YEARS TO US. GREG

01:45:00.127 --> 01:45:02.996
WILL HEART. I SAID THIS IS NOT

01:45:03.063 --> 01:45:04.131
ABOUT THE DEATH PENALTY IT'S

01:45:04.197 --> 01:45:06.733
ABOUT YOU HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH

01:45:06.800 --> 01:45:09.002
A VERY GRAVE ISSUE. OR NO

01:45:09.069 --> 01:45:10.170
LONGER IS IT GOING TO BE AS

01:45:10.237 --> 01:45:13.473
ABSTRACT AS IT HAS BEEN BEFORE.

01:45:13.540 --> 01:45:15.042
NOT MY POINT TO THAT IS JUST AS

01:45:15.108 --> 01:45:17.144
FAR SOCIETY LOOKS AT THIS

01:45:17.210 --> 01:45:19.012
SYSTEM AND MAYBE SOMETIMES SAYS

01:45:19.079 --> 01:45:20.781
FLIP AND THINGS ABOUT THE

01:45:20.847 --> 01:45:23.984
JUSTICE SYSTEM. AND ABOUT THE

01:45:24.051 --> 01:45:28.221
PRISON SYSTEM. WE CAN DO BETTER

01:45:28.288 --> 01:45:30.223
MISSED WHAT WAY I COMMEND YOU

01:45:30.290 --> 01:45:31.458
FOR WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO

01:45:31.525 --> 01:45:32.659
THEIR TO NEW DOING IT

01:45:32.726 --> 01:45:35.228
SUCCESSFULLY. YOU'RE PUTTING

01:45:35.295 --> 01:45:37.898
YOURSELF IN THOSE SHOES. AND

01:45:37.964 --> 01:45:41.201
YOUR SHOWING THE APATHY. AND

01:45:41.268 --> 01:45:43.470
YOUR GIVEN INDIVIDUALS SOME

01:45:43.537 --> 01:45:45.572
HELP THAT IS CRITICALLY

01:45:45.639 --> 01:45:52.379
IMPORTANT. THAT ONE OF THE

01:45:52.446 --> 01:45:55.882
CONCERNS I HAVE THEN WAS. AN

01:45:55.949 --> 01:45:59.886
AUDIT LAST YEAR THAT SHOWED.

01:45:59.953 --> 01:46:02.456
NOT A VERY BIG IMPACT ON

01:46:02.522 --> 01:46:06.026
RECIDIVISM. BY OUR CUSTODY

01:46:06.093 --> 01:46:10.864
PROGRAMS. NOW THAT SADLY

01:46:10.931 --> 01:46:12.733
VALIDATES THE FUNCTIONS THAT I

01:46:12.799 --> 01:46:15.702
HAD LIVING AS I DID FOR A WHOLE

01:46:15.769 --> 01:46:20.240
LOT OF YEARS. ANYBODY PIPE UP

01:46:20.307 --> 01:46:21.742
AND GIVE ME SOME THOUGHTS HOW

01:46:21.808 --> 01:46:23.143
WE CAN DO BETTER ON THAT

01:46:23.210 --> 01:46:26.980
KEEPING TRACK. MAYBE SECTOR

01:46:27.047 --> 01:46:28.849
DIAZ I'LL I'LL TAKE A STAB AT

01:46:28.915 --> 01:46:30.417
IT SO IN A RECIDIVISM IS A

01:46:30.484 --> 01:46:31.918
NUMBER THAT CORRECTIONS

01:46:31.985 --> 01:46:33.520
HISTORICALLY HAS BEEN GAUGED ON

01:46:33.587 --> 01:46:35.522
SOMEONE OF OUR REPORT CARD AND

01:46:35.589 --> 01:46:36.289
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S AN

01:46:36.356 --> 01:46:38.859
ACCURATE- YOU KNOW AN ACTOR

01:46:38.925 --> 01:46:40.260
REPORTER AND I THINK I THINK MR

01:46:40.327 --> 01:46:41.394
WILEY SPOKE TO ABOUT HOW

01:46:41.461 --> 01:46:43.163
RECIDIVISM I LOOK AT RECIDIVISM

01:46:43.230 --> 01:46:45.065
AS A- AS A CALIFORNIA NUMBER

01:46:45.132 --> 01:46:46.666
NOT A CDC OUR NUMBER. IS

01:46:46.733 --> 01:46:48.368
INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE IN OUR

01:46:48.435 --> 01:46:49.836
SYSTEM A ONE DAY RELEASED BACK

01:46:49.903 --> 01:46:51.638
TO COMMUNITIES I THINK THE

01:46:51.705 --> 01:46:53.707
REPORT YOU SAW IS- RECIDIVISM

01:46:53.774 --> 01:46:55.575
THE LAST NUMBER THAT WE PUT OUT

01:46:55.642 --> 01:46:57.778
ITS RELATIVELY STAGNANT IT DID

01:46:57.844 --> 01:46:59.446
MOVE VERY MUCH. BUT THAT

01:46:59.513 --> 01:47:01.014
DOESN'T MEAN IT'S IT ISN'T

01:47:01.081 --> 01:47:03.216
WORKING BECAUSE ONE THERE IS A

01:47:03.283 --> 01:47:05.051
SLIGHT SLIGHT DOWNTURN IS NOT A

01:47:05.118 --> 01:47:06.419
FULL POINT BUT PERCENTAGE

01:47:06.486 --> 01:47:08.955
POINTS DOWN ON CRIMES AGAINST

01:47:09.022 --> 01:47:11.458
PERSONS. WHAT HAS KEPT THAT

01:47:11.525 --> 01:47:13.527
RELATIVELY STAGNANT IS THE

01:47:13.593 --> 01:47:16.029
PROPERTY CRIMES PIECE YEAH SO I

01:47:16.096 --> 01:47:18.398
WAS I'M HAPPY TO- AND I

01:47:18.465 --> 01:47:19.666
APPRECIATE THE FUNDING WE

01:47:19.733 --> 01:47:21.067
RECEIVED AS WE'RE GOING TO BE

01:47:21.134 --> 01:47:22.769
ADDRESS IN SUBSTANCE ABUSE

01:47:22.836 --> 01:47:24.604
DISORDERS. ROLE IN THAT PROGRAM

01:47:24.671 --> 01:47:26.373
OUT- AND ADDRESSING THE SUCH AS

01:47:26.439 --> 01:47:28.642
BUSA SOARING NEEDS OF INMATES

01:47:28.708 --> 01:47:29.843
AND THEN I WAS VERY HAPPY HERE

01:47:29.910 --> 01:47:31.444
YESTERDAY STATE OF THE STATE ON

01:47:31.511 --> 01:47:33.246
HOW YOU'RE LOOKING TO EXPAND

01:47:33.313 --> 01:47:35.081
THE MEDICARE SERVICES SO THERE

01:47:35.148 --> 01:47:36.082
WILL WE WILL HAVE THAT

01:47:36.149 --> 01:47:38.351
CONTINUITY OF CARE. OF THAT

01:47:38.418 --> 01:47:40.320
SERVICE FROM PRISON INTO THE

01:47:40.387 --> 01:47:42.522
COMMUNITIES- BECAUSE IF WE

01:47:42.589 --> 01:47:43.623
DON'T ADDRESS ALL SUCH AS ABUSE

01:47:43.690 --> 01:47:45.926
DISORDER NEEDS- WE'RE JUST SET

01:47:45.992 --> 01:47:48.695
PEOPLE UP FOR A RETURN. AND A

01:47:48.762 --> 01:47:50.330
THREE YEAR OLD COHORTS THAT WE

01:47:50.397 --> 01:47:52.299
USE FOR COUNTY RECIDIVISM IS

01:47:52.365 --> 01:47:54.100
ARREST CONVICTION AND RETURN TO

01:47:54.167 --> 01:47:55.869
STATE PRISON. SO IT'S A PRETTY

01:47:55.936 --> 01:47:57.404
HIGH BAR ON HOW WE CAN

01:47:57.470 --> 01:47:59.339
RECIDIVISM BY THOSE THREE

01:47:59.406 --> 01:48:02.776
POINTS SO- I'M I'M HOPEFUL I

01:48:02.843 --> 01:48:05.278
WAS GLAD I'D LOVE TO SEE THAT-

01:48:05.345 --> 01:48:07.447
YOU KNOW RECIDIVISM. GO DOWN

01:48:07.514 --> 01:48:09.049
WHICH IS A GOOD MARKER BUT IT'S

01:48:09.115 --> 01:48:10.317
LIKE I SAID EARLIER IT'S REALLY

01:48:10.383 --> 01:48:12.319
A CALIFORNIA EFFORT AS WE BUILD

01:48:12.385 --> 01:48:14.387
PARTNERSHIPS WITH CITIES AND

01:48:14.454 --> 01:48:15.689
COUNTIES AND COMMUNICATING THE

01:48:15.755 --> 01:48:17.691
SHERIFFS AND CHIEFS OF POLICE-

01:48:17.757 --> 01:48:20.026
AND ALL TO EMPLOYERS OUT THERE

01:48:20.093 --> 01:48:21.261
THAT INDIVIDUALS LIVE IN OUR

01:48:21.328 --> 01:48:27.767
PRISONS. THE THEY ARE RECEIVING.

01:48:27.834 --> 01:48:31.238
NATIONALLY CERTIFIED BOB SKILLS

01:48:31.304 --> 01:48:33.740
LIKE BE YOU. IN THAT ALL IN IS

01:48:33.807 --> 01:48:35.475
THAT. THIRD CHANCE SOME. AND

01:48:35.542 --> 01:48:36.910
THE TO DO THAT. AND WE JUST

01:48:36.977 --> 01:48:38.178
CAN'T COUNT THE- THINGS READ IN

01:48:38.245 --> 01:48:38.979
THE PAPER OF THESE HORRIFIC

01:48:39.045 --> 01:48:40.247
ACTS OF A READ SOMETIME. THAT

01:48:40.313 --> 01:48:41.047
THAT'S ALL OF THEM THAT'S ALL

01:48:41.114 --> 01:48:42.515
OF THEM. THAT'S A SMALLER

01:48:42.582 --> 01:48:43.717
SMALLER PERCENTAGE AND WE WOULD

01:48:43.783 --> 01:48:45.852
LIKE TO KNOW EVERY VIOLENT ACT

01:48:45.919 --> 01:48:47.554
BY PEOPLE LIVE IN PRISON IS A-

01:48:47.621 --> 01:48:49.256
THIS IS A IS A TRAGIC ACT AND

01:48:49.322 --> 01:48:51.691
IT. REFLECTS POORLY ON THE

01:48:51.758 --> 01:48:53.693
PEOPLE THAT ARE REALLY TRYING.

01:48:53.760 --> 01:48:54.928
TO DO THE RIGHT THING AND HOW

01:48:54.995 --> 01:48:56.596
SOME PEOPLE PAY IN A BAD LIGHT

01:48:56.663 --> 01:48:58.565
ON. THE MAJORITY PEOPLE WHO

01:48:58.632 --> 01:48:59.866
JUST WANTED TO WRITE AND JUST

01:48:59.933 --> 01:49:00.634
GET THE SECOND AND THIRD

01:49:00.700 --> 01:49:03.169
CHANCE. SO I THINK THE ARM AND

01:49:03.236 --> 01:49:04.738
FOR MY PART I THINK MORE

01:49:04.804 --> 01:49:06.539
COLLABORATION WITH COMMUNITIES.

01:49:06.606 --> 01:49:08.141
BUILDING BETTER PARTNERSHIPS

01:49:08.208 --> 01:49:10.410
WITH- PRISON TO EMPLOYMENT. WE

01:49:10.477 --> 01:49:11.211
DO HAVE A DIVISION OF

01:49:11.278 --> 01:49:12.579
CORRECTIONS PRESENT EMPLOYMENT

01:49:12.646 --> 01:49:13.880
WE HAVE A POINT PERSON WHO'S

01:49:13.947 --> 01:49:16.616
OUT THERE BUILDING TIES WITH-

01:49:16.683 --> 01:49:21.187
WITH UNIONS WITH- WORKFORCE

01:49:21.254 --> 01:49:22.923
ARE GETTING PEOPLE JOBS WHEN

01:49:22.989 --> 01:49:27.627
THEY GET OUT. SO I THINK. YOU

01:49:27.694 --> 01:49:28.795
KNOW I HOPE I SHOULD LIVE BLOOD

01:49:28.862 --> 01:49:30.463
ON YOUR OF THE- THANK YOU AND

01:49:30.530 --> 01:49:33.366
GOOD KEEP MIND TO. IT BECAUSE I

01:49:33.433 --> 01:49:36.670
THINK. STATURE SOME SKEWED A

01:49:36.736 --> 01:49:37.904
BIT BECAUSE THE CORRECT IF YOU

01:49:37.971 --> 01:49:40.240
AGO. RE DEFINED. TO LET THE

01:49:40.307 --> 01:49:43.143
ABOUT THIS. THAT DOES INDEED

01:57:58.404 --> 01:58:01.274
SERVICES AND RATHER THAN US

01:58:01.340 --> 01:58:02.842
GETTING INTO IT TODAY ALL STEVE

01:58:02.909 --> 01:58:05.111
IT FOR MYSELF EIGHTY SO WHAT I

01:58:05.178 --> 01:58:06.446
WOULD LIKE TO FOCUS ON RIGHT

01:58:06.512 --> 01:58:07.880
NOW IN TERMS OF MY QUESTIONS

01:58:07.947 --> 01:58:10.416
IS. THAT AS HAS BEEN MENTIONED

01:58:10.483 --> 01:58:13.586
BY MOST EVERYONE THAT THE WE IS

01:58:13.653 --> 01:58:14.821
THE LEGISLATURE AND THE

01:58:14.887 --> 01:58:16.622
GOVERNOR HAVE STATED GOAL TO

01:58:16.689 --> 01:58:18.691
REDUCE FACILITIES WE KNOW THAT

01:58:18.758 --> 01:58:21.127
THE ONLY WAY TO ACHIEVE THAT.

01:58:21.194 --> 01:58:23.429
IS WITH APPROPRIATE POPULATION

01:58:23.496 --> 01:58:26.732
REDUCTIONS- AND SO RATHER THAN

01:58:26.799 --> 01:58:28.734
FOCUSING ON EITHER HOW DO WE

01:58:28.801 --> 01:58:30.036
CHOOSE WHICH FACILITY OR THAT

01:58:30.102 --> 01:58:32.104
SORT OF THING I'D RATHER SORT

01:58:32.171 --> 01:58:34.373
OF TALK ABOUT WHAT. WHAT WE'RE

01:58:34.440 --> 01:58:37.276
GONNA DO TO. GET THOSE

01:58:37.343 --> 01:58:41.881
POPULATION REDUCTIONS IN-

01:58:41.948 --> 01:58:43.549
THIRTY SO FAR CORRECTLY

01:58:43.616 --> 01:58:46.853
RIGHTFULLY TALKED NUMBERS. BUT

01:58:46.919 --> 01:58:50.490
AS A MISTER FROM DEPARTMENT

01:58:50.556 --> 01:58:52.358
FINANCE POINTED OUT OBVIOUSLY

01:58:52.425 --> 01:59:00.933
THERE THIS IS MORE. THAN THAT.

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:02.335
THE NUMBERS REPRESENT PEOPLE.

01:59:02.401 --> 01:59:06.672
AND WE BE DOING IN A WAY. THAT

01:59:06.739 --> 01:59:08.841
INTEREST PUBLIC SAFE AND THAT.

01:59:08.908 --> 01:59:11.477
HAS FAR FOLKS WERE RELEASED IN

01:59:11.544 --> 01:59:15.047
KIND OF SIR THAT MISSED JOHNSON

01:59:15.114 --> 01:59:15.848
THAT YOU KNOW WE'RE AS WE RICH

01:59:15.915 --> 01:59:17.717
PEOPLE TO WE WANT TO BE A TO

01:59:17.783 --> 01:59:20.019
SUCCESS RANCH AND BE IN OUR CAN.

01:59:20.086 --> 01:59:22.421
AND TO MISTER AGREED OF THAT SO

01:59:22.488 --> 01:59:23.856
IS IT THAT WE DESIGNED THE

01:59:23.923 --> 01:59:25.258
APPROPRIATE POPULATION

01:59:25.324 --> 01:59:26.392
REDUCTIONS ACHIEVED THE

01:59:26.459 --> 01:59:27.426
APPROPRIATE POPULATION

01:59:27.493 --> 01:59:28.794
REDUCTIONS WITH THAT SAME TIME

01:59:28.861 --> 01:59:32.064
THAT WE ACHIEVE THIS TYPE OF

01:59:32.131 --> 01:59:36.702
REAL REHABILITATION. SO LET ADD

01:59:36.769 --> 01:59:40.373
SPECIFIC THE QUESTION FIRST.

01:59:40.439 --> 01:59:41.908
AND WITH MY FIRST QUESTION OUR

01:59:41.974 --> 01:59:44.210
POPULATION REDUCTION IS AS

01:59:44.277 --> 01:59:45.478
YOU'VE DESCRIBED WE HAVE A VERY

01:59:45.545 --> 01:59:48.281
AGING POPULATION IN OUR PRISON.

01:59:48.347 --> 01:59:50.316
AND THAT IS JUST LIKE

01:59:50.383 --> 01:59:51.918
HEALTHCARE COSTS IN THE OVERALL

01:59:51.984 --> 01:59:53.519
SOCIETY'S GENDER IN GENERAL

01:59:53.586 --> 01:59:54.921
THERE'S A SMALL PERCENT OF

01:59:54.987 --> 01:59:57.056
PEOPLE THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR

01:59:57.123 --> 01:59:58.324
THE BIGGEST COSTS OF THE

01:59:58.391 --> 01:59:59.792
HEALTHCARE MANY OF THEM ARE

01:59:59.859 --> 02:00:01.594
WITHIN THAT AGING POPULATION

02:00:01.661 --> 02:00:03.829
WE'VE PASSED MANY STRATEGIES

02:00:03.896 --> 02:00:05.831
RELATED TO THAT AS FAR AS I CAN

02:00:05.898 --> 02:00:07.633
TELL FROM REPORTS I'VE SEEN

02:00:07.700 --> 02:00:09.902
THEY'VE NOT REALLY AN IMPACTING

02:00:09.969 --> 02:00:13.005
MUCH REDUCTION POPULATION SO

02:00:13.072 --> 02:00:17.076
COULD WHOEVER ON THE PANELS-

02:00:17.143 --> 02:00:19.011
TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT. I

02:00:19.078 --> 02:00:20.546
WHICH OF THOSE ARE WORK ON WINE

02:00:20.613 --> 02:00:22.348
IN WHAT OTHER STE. SHOULD WE

02:00:22.415 --> 02:00:28.454
PERHAPS BE CONSIDERING. I CAN

02:00:28.521 --> 02:00:30.923
GO AHEAD AND- GIVE AN ADDRESS

02:00:30.990 --> 02:00:34.894
THAT. YOU REFERENCE I THINK ARE

02:00:34.961 --> 02:00:36.929
THE ELDERLY POPULATION AND OUT-

02:00:36.996 --> 02:00:39.732
AN AGING POPULATION AND IT

02:00:39.799 --> 02:00:42.435
PEARL PROCESS FOR A INDIVIDUALS

02:00:42.501 --> 02:00:45.538
WHO ARE- GENERALLY CONSIDER IT

02:00:45.605 --> 02:00:46.906
CONSIDER FOR REAL RELEASE IF

02:00:46.973 --> 02:00:48.107
THEY SERVE MORE THAN TWENTY

02:00:48.174 --> 02:00:49.442
FIVE YEARS IN PRISON AND REACH

02:00:49.508 --> 02:00:51.811
SIXTY YEARS OLD- AS YOU NOTED

02:00:51.877 --> 02:00:54.547
THAT PROCESS HASN'T BEEN ANY

02:00:54.614 --> 02:00:56.182
CITY HUGELY SIGNIFICANT IN

02:00:56.248 --> 02:00:57.917
TERMS OF LARGE NUMBERS OF

02:00:57.984 --> 02:01:01.053
POPULATION REDUCTIONS- THAT

02:01:01.120 --> 02:01:03.022
COULD PERHAPS BE CHANGED IF THE

02:01:03.089 --> 02:01:04.857
THRESHOLDS WERE. SIGNIFICANTLY

02:01:04.924 --> 02:01:08.060
ALTERED BY FOR EXAMPLE AND

02:01:08.127 --> 02:01:09.462
REDUCING NEED- TIME SERVE

02:01:09.528 --> 02:01:11.797
REQUIREMENT BENEATH TWENTY FIVE

02:01:11.864 --> 02:01:13.466
YEARS OR REDUCING THE AGE

02:01:13.532 --> 02:01:15.801
REQUIREMENT BELOW SIXTY YEARS-

02:01:15.868 --> 02:01:18.838
THERE'S A OTHER POPULATION

02:01:18.904 --> 02:01:20.339
MANAGEMENT OPTIONS THAT THE

02:01:20.406 --> 02:01:23.142
STATE HAS- WHICH I CAN GIVE YOU

02:01:23.209 --> 02:01:26.445
SOME EXAMPLES OF- SO TO FURTHER

02:01:26.512 --> 02:01:28.114
REDUCE THE OVERALL INMATE

02:01:28.180 --> 02:01:30.816
POPULATION- AND- THERE ISN'T

02:01:30.883 --> 02:01:31.817
THERE'S VARIOUS OPTIONS FOR

02:01:31.884 --> 02:01:33.285
EXAMPLE THE STE AND THE STATE

02:01:33.352 --> 02:01:34.920
COULD REQUIRE THE BOARD OF

02:01:34.987 --> 02:01:37.089
PAROLE HEARINGS TO RELEASE TO

02:01:37.156 --> 02:01:38.891
INITIATE RELEASE CONSIDERATION

02:01:38.958 --> 02:01:45.197
FOR NONVIOLENT OFFENDERS. UNDER

02:01:45.264 --> 02:01:46.365
THE PROP FIFTIES. ACCESS TO

02:01:46.432 --> 02:01:47.466
DAYS THAN NOW TO EXIT RELEASE

02:01:47.533 --> 02:01:50.336
AT SOME WE FREE READ IT COULD

02:01:50.403 --> 02:01:51.804
ALSO X. OUR TO MAKE COST PLACE.

02:01:51.871 --> 02:01:52.838
WHICH WOULD ALLOW IN UNDER CC I

02:01:52.905 --> 02:01:55.241
EXIT. CREDIT EARNING POLICIES

02:01:55.307 --> 02:01:58.110
TO- SIMPLY BY CHANGING OF THEIR

02:01:58.177 --> 02:02:00.379
HOUSING STATUS TO EARN CREDITS

02:02:00.446 --> 02:02:02.314
AT A FASTER RATE PUT IN- IN

02:02:02.381 --> 02:02:04.650
TURN- REDUCE THE INMATE

02:02:04.717 --> 02:02:07.853
POPULATION- OR- A COULD THE

02:02:07.920 --> 02:02:09.255
STATE COULD ENACT FURTHER

02:02:09.321 --> 02:02:11.390
SENSING CHANGES THE ELDERLY PRO

02:02:11.457 --> 02:02:12.491
PROCESS BEING ONE OF THEM BUT

02:02:12.558 --> 02:02:13.793
YOU KNOW. MANY MANY OTHER

02:02:13.859 --> 02:02:16.429
OPTIONS A CDC ARE ALSO HAS

02:02:16.495 --> 02:02:18.397
SIGNIFICANT HAS CONTROL OVER IN

02:02:18.464 --> 02:02:20.199
MAY CREDIT EARNING SO IT COULD

02:02:20.266 --> 02:02:20.966
IT COULD CHANGE THOSE POLICIES

02:02:21.033 --> 02:02:22.902
WHICH WOULD. IN A WAY THAT

02:02:22.968 --> 02:02:23.402
WOULD REDUCE THE INMATE

02:02:23.469 --> 02:02:27.073
POPULATION- OTHER POPULATION

02:02:27.139 --> 02:02:28.741
MANAGEMENT OPTIONS- TO THE

02:02:28.808 --> 02:02:31.610
EXTENT AND THE STATE WANTS TO.

02:02:31.677 --> 02:02:33.479
REMOVE AND MAKE- REDUCE THE

02:02:33.546 --> 02:02:34.980
NUMBER OF INMATES HOUSED IN

02:02:35.047 --> 02:02:37.083
STATE OPERATED STATE OWN

02:02:37.149 --> 02:02:39.085
PRISONS THAT IS THE THIRTY FOUR

02:02:39.151 --> 02:02:39.685
PERSONS THAT THE COURT ORDER.

02:02:39.752 --> 02:02:42.154
UP IS TO- FOR EXAMPLE THAT IT

02:02:42.221 --> 02:02:43.489
COULD CLOSE ONE OF THOSE

02:02:43.556 --> 02:02:45.991
PRISONS FASTER THAN OTHERWISE-

02:02:46.058 --> 02:02:47.827
THE STATE COULD INCREASE THE

02:02:47.893 --> 02:02:48.994
CONSERVATION CAMP POPULATION

02:02:49.061 --> 02:02:52.798
BIKE PAN NATO SUCH BY LAW

02:02:52.865 --> 02:02:55.167
INMATES WITH MY FOR. DETAINER

02:02:55.234 --> 02:03:02.942
AS INTO CAN AS WE READ IT CAN.

02:03:03.008 --> 02:03:06.245
THAT IS ONE. OF RECOMMENDED

02:03:06.312 --> 02:03:08.514
THIS COULD ALSO GET IN

02:03:08.581 --> 02:03:09.849
EXPANDING FOR INMATES TO CAN

02:03:09.915 --> 02:03:14.153
LIKE X. PAY COULD ALSO ALLOWING

02:03:14.220 --> 02:03:15.020
EXPANDING ALLAH FOR PROGRAMS

02:03:15.087 --> 02:03:16.222
LIKE THE ALTERNATIVE PROGRAM BY

02:03:16.288 --> 02:03:17.656
ADMITTING FOR EXAMPLE INMATES

02:03:17.723 --> 02:03:18.958
WITH MORE THAN TWELVE MONTHS

02:03:19.024 --> 02:03:21.460
LEFT TO SERVE AND BY JUST TO

02:03:21.527 --> 02:03:22.962
KIND OF DRAW THAT POINT HOME

02:03:23.028 --> 02:03:24.396
THOSE THOSE ACTIONS WOULDN'T

02:03:24.463 --> 02:03:26.565
NECESSARILY REDUCE THE OVERALL

02:03:26.632 --> 02:03:28.467
AMOUNT MAY POPULATION BUT THEY

02:03:28.534 --> 02:03:29.869
WOULD REDUCE THE NUMBER OF

02:03:29.935 --> 02:03:32.071
INMATES REQUIRED THAT THE STATE

02:03:32.138 --> 02:03:34.406
MUST HOUSE IN ITS- THIRTY FOR.

02:03:34.473 --> 02:03:38.878
I STATE OWNED PRISON. IN ORDER

02:03:38.944 --> 02:03:43.449
FOR ANYONE ELSE IN THE. I WOULD

02:03:43.516 --> 02:03:45.584
ADD THE ON THE ELDER PAROLE SO

02:03:45.651 --> 02:03:49.388
ELDERLY. TERRIBLE NAME. OF BUT

02:03:49.455 --> 02:03:51.023
IT IS IT'S ACTUALLY ONE OF A

02:03:51.090 --> 02:03:52.658
COUPLE OF DIFFERENT THE

02:03:52.725 --> 02:03:55.928
MEASURES THAT WERE- ENACTED IN

02:03:55.995 --> 02:03:57.463
ORDER TO DEAL WITH THE

02:03:57.530 --> 02:03:58.330
OVERCROWDING SITUATION

02:03:58.397 --> 02:03:59.899
RESPONSES TO THE THREE JUDGE

02:03:59.965 --> 02:04:02.401
PANEL ONE OF THE EARLIER ONES

02:04:02.468 --> 02:04:04.370
WAS OF STARTING TO RECOGNIZE

02:04:04.436 --> 02:04:06.472
WHICH GAVE RISE TO THE SENATE

02:04:06.539 --> 02:04:08.040
BILL TWO SIXTY INTO SIXTY ONE

02:04:08.107 --> 02:04:09.675
BUT TO RECOGNIZE PEOPLE WHO

02:04:09.742 --> 02:04:10.976
WERE YOUNG AT THE TIME OF THEIR

02:04:11.043 --> 02:04:12.845
CRIMES AND GOT LONG SENTENCES

02:04:12.912 --> 02:04:13.946
SHOULD GET SPECIALIZED

02:04:14.013 --> 02:04:15.514
CONSIDERATION PROCESS AN

02:04:15.581 --> 02:04:16.749
OPPORTUNE IN THE SHOW THAT

02:04:16.816 --> 02:04:18.350
THEY'VE CHANGED IN CAN SAFELY

02:04:18.417 --> 02:04:20.920
HOME. UP ONE OF THE BIG

02:04:20.986 --> 02:04:24.123
CONCERNS I HAD WAS THAT. THAT

02:04:24.190 --> 02:04:26.292
THE LANGUAGE AND THOSE BILLS

02:04:26.358 --> 02:04:28.160
ALLOW THE BOARD TOO MUCH

02:04:28.227 --> 02:04:31.664
DISCRETION FRANKLY. AND WHAT

02:04:31.730 --> 02:04:33.199
WILD THERE'S A THERE'S GREAT

02:04:33.265 --> 02:04:34.867
PROMISE THE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE

02:04:34.934 --> 02:04:37.403
WHO WERE SENTENCED UNDER AGE

02:04:37.469 --> 02:04:38.304
EIGHTEEN THOUSANDS MORE UNDER

02:04:38.370 --> 02:04:40.806
AGED TWENTY SIX WHICH IS THE

02:04:40.873 --> 02:04:44.310
NEW STANDARD. WHO QUALIFY FOR.

02:04:44.376 --> 02:04:46.245
FOR USE PAROLE HEARINGS- IN

02:04:46.312 --> 02:04:49.882
PRACTICE. THEIR PROGRAM RATES

02:04:49.949 --> 02:04:52.585
ARE WORSE. THEN EVERYBODY ELSE

02:04:52.651 --> 02:04:54.753
WORST THE AVERAGE THEY'RE MORE

02:04:54.820 --> 02:04:57.289
LIKELY TO BE DENIED PAROLE.

02:04:57.356 --> 02:04:59.358
CLEARLY NOT THE WHAT WE

02:04:59.425 --> 02:05:01.727
INTENDED WITH THAT RIGHT- IN

02:05:01.794 --> 02:05:03.395
THIS IS A THIS IS ALSO WHY YOU

02:05:03.462 --> 02:05:05.231
SEE THAT THE THERE HASN'T BEEN

02:05:05.297 --> 02:05:07.032
A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN AMONG

02:05:07.099 --> 02:05:09.401
THE IN IN THE AGING POPULATION

02:05:09.468 --> 02:05:12.605
ELDERLY PAROLE PROCESS BECAUSE

02:05:12.671 --> 02:05:15.407
OF THE PAROLE BOARD. STILL IS

02:05:15.474 --> 02:05:17.943
RELYING ON FACTORS THAT DON'T

02:05:18.010 --> 02:05:18.510
ALWAYS CORRELATE THE PUBLIC

02:05:18.577 --> 02:05:23.182
SAFETY. THEY ARE REACTING TO-

02:05:23.249 --> 02:05:24.783
VARIATIONS IN SOMEONE'S

02:05:24.850 --> 02:05:26.652
ARTICULATION OF INSIGHT REMORSE

02:05:26.719 --> 02:05:28.654
THAT DON'T ALWAYS MATCH WHAT

02:05:28.721 --> 02:05:30.022
THE BOARD THINKS IT SHOULD LOOK

02:05:30.089 --> 02:05:33.626
LIKE AND THEY'RE RELYING ON-

02:05:33.692 --> 02:05:35.427
ANCIENT RULE VIOLATIONS OR EVEN

02:05:35.494 --> 02:05:37.963
ALLEGATIONS ARE UNPROVEN WHICH

02:05:38.030 --> 02:05:39.732
IS REALLY A REALLY HUGE ISSUE.

02:05:39.798 --> 02:05:40.432
WHERE YOU HAVE BROKEN

02:05:40.499 --> 02:05:41.700
MISSIONERS WHO ARE QUESTIONING

02:05:41.767 --> 02:05:43.702
SOMEONE ABOUT SOMETHING THAT

02:05:43.769 --> 02:05:45.237
APPEARS IN A CONFIDENTIAL

02:05:45.304 --> 02:05:49.341
FOLDER TWENTY YEARS AGO. UP IN

02:05:49.408 --> 02:05:50.709
OUR THEY WERE NO A PERSON'S

02:05:50.776 --> 02:05:52.244
NEVER CHARGE WITH THE WAS HERE

02:05:52.311 --> 02:05:53.612
TO REFER GUILTY. THE

02:05:53.679 --> 02:05:54.780
COMMISSIONERS ARE INTERPRETING

02:05:54.847 --> 02:05:56.282
THIS ONE LINE ALLEGATION AS A

02:05:56.348 --> 02:05:58.684
STATEMENT OF FACT AND THEN WHEN

02:05:58.751 --> 02:05:59.919
THE PERSON DENIES IT TODAY.

02:05:59.985 --> 02:06:02.354
THEN YOU LACK CREDIBILITY LACK

02:06:02.421 --> 02:06:04.290
INSIGHT- UNSUITABLE FOR PAROLE

02:06:04.356 --> 02:06:05.724
THEY DENY THAT THIS IS A

02:06:05.791 --> 02:06:07.293
PRACTICE THAT HAS BEEN GOING ON

02:06:07.359 --> 02:06:10.362
FOR MANY MANY YEARS IT HAS

02:06:10.429 --> 02:06:10.896
NOTHING TO DO WITH PUBLIC

02:06:10.963 --> 02:06:13.065
SAFETY REALLY. BUT IT DOES HAVE

02:06:13.132 --> 02:06:14.199
TO DO WITH THE HOW COMFORTABLE

02:06:14.266 --> 02:06:15.267
COMMISSIONS ARE WITH THE PERSON

02:06:15.334 --> 02:06:16.435
APPEAR BEFORE THEM HOW THEY

02:06:16.502 --> 02:06:18.537
PRESENT ALL THOSE THINGS- SO AS

02:06:18.604 --> 02:06:20.105
LONG AS THERE IS THAT LEVEL OF

02:06:20.172 --> 02:06:23.676
DISCRETION. THAT CAN EASILY BE

02:06:23.742 --> 02:06:25.077
ABUSED UNFORTUNATELY. THEN I'LL

02:06:25.144 --> 02:06:25.844
THINK YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A

02:06:25.911 --> 02:06:28.180
SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT. IN

02:06:28.247 --> 02:06:29.682
OUTCOMES THROUGH THE

02:06:29.748 --> 02:06:31.417
DISCRETIONARY PROPUESTAS WHICH

02:06:31.483 --> 02:06:34.486
UNFORTUNATELY HAS BECOME. OF

02:06:34.553 --> 02:06:36.855
THE MAIN WAY THAT WE PROVIDE

02:06:36.922 --> 02:06:38.390
ACCESS FOR PEOPLE TO COME HOME

02:06:38.457 --> 02:06:39.658
FROM PRISON AS IT IS WITH ALL

02:06:39.725 --> 02:06:41.060
THE REFORMS LAST YEAR'S ABOUT

02:06:41.126 --> 02:06:43.262
HALF THE PRISON POPULATION WILL

02:06:43.329 --> 02:06:44.663
GO TO THE PAROLE BOARD. BUT THE

02:06:44.730 --> 02:06:46.832
OUTCOMES ARE TERRIBLE FRANKLY

02:06:46.899 --> 02:06:48.167
LAST YEAR THE REPORTED I THINK

02:06:48.233 --> 02:06:49.468
NINETEEN AND A HALF PERCENT.

02:06:49.535 --> 02:06:52.071
PROGRAM RATE WHICH IS ABOUT

02:06:52.137 --> 02:06:53.172
WITH MAYBE A LITTLE LOWER THAN

02:06:53.238 --> 02:06:55.741
WAS THE YEAR BEFORE THAT AND

02:06:55.808 --> 02:06:56.308
I'M TOLD IT'S GOING TO BE A

02:06:56.375 --> 02:06:58.410
LITTLE LOWER THIS YEAR- SO WE

02:06:58.477 --> 02:07:00.479
NEED TO FIND WAYS TO SWITCH

02:07:00.546 --> 02:07:01.413
SWITCH THOSE NUMBERS OF THE

02:07:01.480 --> 02:07:03.382
PEOPLE WHO ARE SO THE BEST

02:07:03.449 --> 02:07:05.451
SUITED AND IN A MORE MORE ALSO

02:07:05.517 --> 02:07:06.719
JOHNSON'S GET A CHANCE TO COME

02:07:06.785 --> 02:07:12.391
ALL. YES WHAT. THAT CLEARLY

02:07:12.458 --> 02:07:14.059
THIS YOU KNOW THE INTENT OF THE

02:07:14.126 --> 02:07:14.860
QUESTIONS FOR THE ELDERLY

02:07:14.927 --> 02:07:16.195
ELDERLY POPULATION WELL

02:07:16.261 --> 02:07:19.698
ACTUALLY. YES THAT WAS ONE. M.

02:07:19.765 --> 02:07:21.567
BUT GIVEN THAT WERE A KIND OF

02:07:21.633 --> 02:07:24.336
EXPANDING THAT IT'S OKAY I MEAN

02:07:24.403 --> 02:07:25.838
WHAT I'M MOST INTERESTED IN IS.

02:07:25.904 --> 02:07:27.306
WE NEED POPULATION REDUCTION

02:07:27.373 --> 02:07:28.974
BUT WE WANTED TO BE EFFECTIVE.

02:07:29.041 --> 02:07:30.342
AND WE WANT TO ENSURE TO

02:07:30.409 --> 02:07:34.079
PROTECT PUBLIC SAFETY AND AS-

02:07:34.146 --> 02:07:34.947
MISTER WATLEY'S POINTED OUT WE

02:07:35.014 --> 02:07:37.750
HAVE. YOU KNOW PUT IN VARIETY

02:07:37.816 --> 02:07:39.585
OF BOTH VOTERS AND LEGISLATURE

02:07:39.651 --> 02:07:43.088
PUT IN A VARIETY OF. MEASURES

02:07:43.155 --> 02:07:46.291
TO IN EFFECT IMPACT THAT. AND

02:07:46.358 --> 02:07:47.960
SOME ARE WORKING SOME AREN'T

02:07:48.027 --> 02:07:49.928
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT STRATEGIES DO

02:07:49.995 --> 02:07:51.597
HAVE TO RECOMMEND TO US THAT

02:07:51.663 --> 02:07:53.665
WOULD BE THE MOST EFFECTIVE AND

02:07:53.732 --> 02:07:56.035
STILL PROTECT PUBLIC SAFETY ON

02:07:56.101 --> 02:07:58.270
ON ON THE BOARD QUESTION ABOUT-

02:07:58.337 --> 02:07:59.805
GRANTING OR THE NILES OR HOW

02:07:59.872 --> 02:08:01.974
THE REVIEW OF WHAT THE REVIEWER

02:08:02.041 --> 02:08:03.475
WHAT THEY CONSIDER- I KNOW THEY

02:08:03.542 --> 02:08:05.277
HAVE EXPANDED AND I KNOW THAT

02:08:05.344 --> 02:08:07.513
YOU HAVE THEY THEY HAVE CHANGED

02:08:07.579 --> 02:08:08.447
ON HOW THEY LOOK AT THEM AND I

02:08:08.514 --> 02:08:09.548
KNOW THIS IS REALLY A QUESTION

02:08:09.615 --> 02:08:11.784
FOR THE COMMISSIONER BPH

02:08:11.850 --> 02:08:13.085
MISSION. TRYING TO GET FROM

02:08:13.152 --> 02:08:20.826
YOUR COME AT ALL BUT. I WILL

02:08:20.893 --> 02:08:21.593
SAY THEY HAVE REALLY RE. AND IS

02:08:21.660 --> 02:08:23.562
A DESIRE CHANGE. THAT THE YOU

02:08:23.629 --> 02:08:24.630
KNOW THE BOARD IS LOOKING A END

02:08:24.696 --> 02:08:25.697
OF. THAT ARE READY FOR RELEASE

02:08:25.764 --> 02:08:27.066
IN THE DON'T POSE A- OR

02:08:27.132 --> 02:08:28.467
UNREASONABLE WRIST. SAFETY ON

02:08:28.534 --> 02:08:30.002
THEY DO GO OUT AND I THINK.

02:08:30.069 --> 02:08:31.470
EVERYONE CAN ACKNOWLEDGE THAT

02:08:31.537 --> 02:08:32.938
THE RATES. YOU KNOW HAVE

02:08:33.005 --> 02:08:34.807
EXPANDED FROM THE YEARS PASSED

02:08:34.873 --> 02:08:35.407
TO WERE. YOU KNOW THEY WERE

02:08:35.474 --> 02:08:37.476
INTO THE HUNDREDS NOW FROM THE

02:08:37.543 --> 02:08:38.310
PRIOR ADMINISTRATION THIS

02:08:38.377 --> 02:08:40.245
ADMINISTRATION TOTALLY WENT TO

02:08:40.312 --> 02:08:41.713
THE THOUSANDS. SO I THINK IT'S

02:08:41.780 --> 02:08:42.948
MORE OF A QUESTION OF BPH AND I

02:08:43.015 --> 02:08:44.516
KNOW THEY ARE RAMPING UP WITH

02:08:44.583 --> 02:08:45.984
MORE STAFFING I KNOW THEY'RE

02:08:46.051 --> 02:08:47.386
LOOKING AT NON VIOLENT. STAFF

02:08:47.453 --> 02:08:48.220
ENOUGH FOR THE NOT VIOLENT

02:08:48.287 --> 02:08:50.456
OFFENDER- BUT I THINK IT'S MORE

02:08:50.522 --> 02:08:53.125
OF A QUESTION FOR. BPH ON THE

02:08:53.192 --> 02:08:56.662
PAROLE PIECE- WHEN IT COMES TO

02:08:56.728 --> 02:08:57.696
LOOKING AT CRAP EXPANDING AT

GREAT MORE CREDITS. WE DO ASK

02:09:05.337 --> 02:09:06.538
OURSELVES QUESTIONS QUITE A BIT

02:09:06.605 --> 02:09:07.773
WE ARE SEVERAL YEARS IN. DC

02:09:07.840 --> 02:09:11.110
FROM THE TO IT WAS. SIMPLY ONE

02:09:11.176 --> 02:09:14.646
THING EVER CALL. OF A SET. IS I

02:09:14.713 --> 02:09:16.014
TO BE MIND. THAT IT ANY

02:09:16.081 --> 02:09:17.449
EXPANSION OF CREDITS TO GET

02:09:17.516 --> 02:09:19.084
PEOPLE OUT OF PRISON I HAVE TO

02:09:19.151 --> 02:09:20.853
MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE DOING IT

02:09:20.919 --> 02:09:22.254
FOR THE PURPOSES. OF

02:09:22.321 --> 02:09:24.423
REHABILITATION NUMBER ONE.

02:09:24.490 --> 02:09:26.358
HANDING OUT CREDIT JUST TO GET

02:09:26.425 --> 02:09:27.759
PEOPLE OUT OF PRISON I DON'T

02:09:27.826 --> 02:09:28.694
BELIEVE THAT'S GOOD FOR PUBLIC

02:09:28.760 --> 02:09:31.063
SAFETY. BUT I. DO BELIEVE THAT

02:09:31.130 --> 02:09:32.364
MEASURE NET WHAT'S WORKING

02:09:32.431 --> 02:09:33.799
WHAT'S NOT WHAT'S MORE

02:09:33.866 --> 02:09:35.501
EFFECTIVE THAT NEEDS TO BE ON

02:09:35.567 --> 02:09:39.004
GOING- THAT WE DO LOOK AT THESE

02:09:39.071 --> 02:09:40.072
NUMBERS AND INTERNALLY WITHIN

02:09:40.139 --> 02:09:41.373
CDC ARE I AM MASS WHAT. CAN WE

02:09:41.440 --> 02:09:43.709
INCREASE THIS SECTION OF PEOPLE

02:09:43.775 --> 02:09:45.944
THAT. THE PEOPLE. I'M ALL FOR

02:09:46.011 --> 02:09:47.646

02:09:47.713 --> 02:09:49.214
THERE A PROPER REHABILITATIVE

02:09:49.281 --> 02:09:53.085
DOSAGE RECEIVED BY THE CIVIC.

02:09:53.152 --> 02:09:53.685
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT THEM OUT

02:09:53.752 --> 02:09:55.654
LACKING NOR DO I WANT THEM UP A

02:09:55.721 --> 02:09:59.291
PREPARED FOR RE ENTRY SIR. SO

02:09:59.358 --> 02:10:00.692
FIELD FIFTY SEVEN CREDITS THAT

02:10:00.759 --> 02:10:01.693
THEY'RE STILL IN MY MIND WE

02:10:01.760 --> 02:10:03.695
STILL ARE. IN THE BUSINESS OF

02:10:03.762 --> 02:10:06.231
SEEKING WHAT IS BEST. ARE CAL

02:10:06.298 --> 02:10:08.133
POPULATION IS LOW OUR MINIMUM

02:10:08.200 --> 02:10:09.234
SUPPORT FACILITIES ARE MORE

02:10:09.301 --> 02:10:11.003
FULL BUT A CAP POPULATIONS AND

02:10:11.069 --> 02:10:12.738
LOGOS WHAT WE DID FIND. IS

02:10:12.804 --> 02:10:14.339
THAT- INMATES WOULD BE FIRST

02:10:14.406 --> 02:10:15.774
THING IN THE MINIMUM SUPPORT

02:10:15.841 --> 02:10:17.176
FACILITIES RATHER THAN GOING

02:10:17.242 --> 02:10:18.610
OUT TO FIRE CAMP. BECAUSE THEY

02:10:18.677 --> 02:10:19.711
SAY WE CAN LEARN THE SAME

02:10:19.778 --> 02:10:21.480
CREDIT I DON'T HAVE TO WORK AS

02:10:21.547 --> 02:10:22.748
HARD. THAT'S A MOTIVATION

02:10:22.814 --> 02:10:24.750
ISSUE. SO MAYBE I DO NEED TO

02:10:24.816 --> 02:10:26.685
DO. A DIFFERENT TYPE OF

02:10:26.752 --> 02:10:28.320
PRESENTATION OF THAT GROUP

02:10:43.769 --> 02:10:46.572
THERE. BUT NOW. I THINK. YOU

02:10:46.638 --> 02:10:48.874
KNOW IT'S- BREAST EXPAND JUST

02:10:48.941 --> 02:10:52.177
SICK OF NUMBERS. OF IT IT WE

02:10:52.244 --> 02:10:53.078
NERVOUS TO DO THAT WITH.

02:10:53.145 --> 02:10:54.513
SHOWING THAT- THAT THERE'S A

02:10:54.580 --> 02:10:59.051
TRUE PUBLIC SAFETY CONNECTION

02:10:59.117 --> 02:11:00.886
WITH THAT. THANK YOU TO A

02:11:00.953 --> 02:11:03.055

02:11:03.121 --> 02:11:05.891
ASK WE ARE. ARE BY SHERRY THE

02:11:05.958 --> 02:11:08.193
ISSUE THE COW. NAME COUNTY IN

02:11:08.260 --> 02:11:09.928
THIS WAS POINTED OUT WE ARE

02:11:09.995 --> 02:11:11.797
ACTUALLY. AND HAVE BEEN FOR

02:11:11.863 --> 02:11:13.065
YEARS ACTING SIGNIFICANT

02:11:13.131 --> 02:11:14.333
AMOUNTS OF MONEY TO THE

COUNTIES BOTH FOR. A FACILITY

02:11:16.702 --> 02:11:20.973
UPGRADES AND FOR- OPERATIONS.

02:11:21.039 --> 02:11:24.076
AND THE IN SOME CASES THE

02:11:24.142 --> 02:11:25.611
COUNTIES HAVE NOT YET SPENT THE

02:11:25.677 --> 02:11:27.379
MONEY THAT THEY WERE GRANTED.

02:11:27.446 --> 02:11:30.816
AND IN OTHER CASES YOU KNOW

02:11:30.882 --> 02:11:31.483

BEEN BROUGHT UP THE- CAN BE AND

02:11:38.023 --> 02:11:39.658
WE DON'T KNOW THAT DETAIL YET

02:11:39.725 --> 02:11:42.060
BUT WE CAN WHEN WE HAVE OUR ME

02:11:42.127 --> 02:11:44.329
WILL A CHART ON THIS THERE'S A

02:11:44.396 --> 02:11:47.466

SOME OF OUR SMALLER COUNTIES

02:11:55.140 --> 02:11:57.009
ARE SENDING A MUCH LARGER

02:11:57.075 --> 02:11:59.111
PERCENT OF THEIR POPULATION TO

02:11:59.177 --> 02:12:02.247

A POPULATION PRESSURE FOR OUR

02:12:12.758 --> 02:12:14.893
STATE PRISONS SO WHAT-

02:12:14.960 --> 02:12:17.796
STRATEGIES MIGHT WE USE TO YOU

02:12:17.863 --> 02:12:20.299
KNOW HELP A DISINCENTIVE VICE.

02:12:20.365 --> 02:12:21.900
THE ALLOWING OF THE PRISON

02:12:21.967 --> 02:12:24.102
POPULATION TO POTENTIALLY BE

02:12:24.169 --> 02:12:27.105
TERM DETERMINED BY LOCAL

02:12:27.172 --> 02:12:32.778
DECISIONS. CHOOSE A WORD WITH

GOVERNOR'S PROBATION PROPOSALS.

02:12:40.752 --> 02:12:42.921
THAT REPRESENTS THE SORT OF-

02:12:42.988 --> 02:12:44.089
SOME STRATEGIES THAT THE

02:12:44.156 --> 02:12:45.691
ADMINISTRATION IS EMPLOYING TO

02:12:45.757 --> 02:12:47.559
TRY TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF

02:12:47.626 --> 02:12:49.461
INDIVIDUALS WITH A HISTORY OF

02:12:49.528 --> 02:12:51.363
MISDEMEANOR CONVICTION. FROM

02:12:51.430 --> 02:12:53.365
COMING TO PRISON AND ONE OF THE

02:12:53.432 --> 02:12:55.067
THINGS THAT WE THINK WOULD BE

02:12:55.133 --> 02:12:57.436
A- STRONG ALTERNATIVE TO THE

02:12:57.502 --> 02:12:58.870
ONES PRESENTED BY THE

02:12:58.937 --> 02:13:00.906
ADMINISTRATION. IS ADJUSTING V.

02:13:00.972 --> 02:13:03.308
SB SIX SEVEN EIGHT FORMULA TO

LONG OUT THEIR OWN. THIRTY TO

02:21:56.941 --> 02:21:59.310
BE CLEVER. I WOULD AT THE-

02:21:59.377 --> 02:22:00.945
UNTIL WE- PRETTY DRASTICALLY TO

02:22:01.012 --> 02:22:02.881
OUR PER SYSTEM. THAT THERE

02:22:02.947 --> 02:22:06.017
NEEDS TO BE A BETTER SUPPORT

02:22:06.084 --> 02:22:06.451
FOR COMMUNITY BASED

02:22:06.518 --> 02:22:08.419
ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE ALREADY

02:22:08.486 --> 02:22:11.155
DOING A LOT OF THE WORK- AND

02:22:11.222 --> 02:22:14.292
DOING KIND OF THE DEEPER WORK

02:22:14.359 --> 02:22:16.294
FOR PEOPLE IN PRISON WE NEEDTO

02:22:16.361 --> 02:22:17.695
MAKE SURE THERE'S CONTINUITY OF

02:22:17.762 --> 02:22:20.198
CARE. SO THAT THE WORK DOING

02:22:20.265 --> 02:22:21.733
INSIDE THEY GET TO CONTINUE

02:22:21.799 --> 02:22:22.800
WHEN FOLKS COME INTO THE

02:22:22.867 --> 02:22:26.004
COMMUNITY- BECAUSE THAT

02:22:26.070 --> 02:22:29.207
TRANSITION HOME. IS ONE THAT

02:22:29.274 --> 02:22:31.109
TAKES AN EMOTIONAL TOLL

02:22:31.175 --> 02:22:31.943
REQUIRES A LOT OF EMOTIONAL

02:22:32.010 --> 02:22:34.112
SUPPORT AND THERE'S THIS ALMOST

02:22:34.178 --> 02:22:35.213
NONE OF THAT CERTAINLY NINE

02:22:35.280 --> 02:22:37.982
COMING FROM THE DIVISION OF

02:22:38.049 --> 02:22:39.951
ADULT ROLE OPERATIONS- THERE'S

02:22:40.018 --> 02:22:41.886
NOT A COUNSELOR SOMEONE CAN GO

02:22:41.953 --> 02:22:43.688
TO TALK TO ABOUT THE FACT THAT

02:22:43.755 --> 02:22:44.989
THEY BROKE DOWN CRYING A LITTLE

02:22:45.056 --> 02:22:46.991
TRAFFIC NOT SOMEONE WHO

02:22:47.058 --> 02:22:48.493
UNDERSTAND THAT. CAN BE

02:22:48.559 --> 02:22:50.361
SUPPORTIVE OF THAT- BUT THE

02:22:50.428 --> 02:22:51.296
COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS

02:22:51.362 --> 02:22:52.397
THAT HAVE STARTED BUILDING

02:22:52.463 --> 02:22:53.598
THESE RELATIONSHIPS WITH PEOPLE

02:22:53.665 --> 02:22:56.334
WATER INSIDE- TO MAKE SURE

02:22:56.401 --> 02:22:57.602
THEY'RE SUPPORTED AND CONTINUE

02:22:57.669 --> 02:22:59.103
THAT WORK. ON THE OUTSIDE AGAIN

02:22:59.170 --> 02:23:01.572
THIS IS. GREEN BAY'S

02:23:01.639 --> 02:23:03.708
ORGANIZATION SHOULDN'T BE BE

02:23:03.775 --> 02:23:06.878
FOR EVER SOLUTION. BUT AS I

02:23:06.945 --> 02:23:08.146
SAID UNTIL THE PRISON

02:23:08.212 --> 02:23:10.848
POPULATION AND COMMUNITY AND

02:23:10.915 --> 02:23:12.884
SYSTEM IS DRAMATICALLY

02:23:12.951 --> 02:23:15.320
TRANSFORMED. WE PLAY A PRETTY

02:23:15.386 --> 02:23:17.522
VITAL ROLE- AND HELPING PEOPLE

02:23:17.588 --> 02:23:21.259
MAKE THAT TRANSITION. SO A

02:23:21.326 --> 02:23:22.694
COUPLE YEARS AGO OUR OFFICE

02:23:22.760 --> 02:23:24.495
RELEASED A PORT ON THE LOOKING

02:23:24.562 --> 02:23:26.731
AT WAYS THE STATE COULD IMPROVE

02:23:26.798 --> 02:23:27.932
IN PRISON REHABILITATION

02:23:27.999 --> 02:23:29.734
PROGRAMS I THINK THIS WILL BOTH

02:23:29.801 --> 02:23:31.069
BOTH TOUCH ON YOUR QUESTION IN

02:23:31.135 --> 02:23:32.637
SOME OF YOUR EARLIER QUESTIONS

02:23:32.704 --> 02:23:35.506
ARE SENATOR NIELSEN- ONE OF THE

02:23:35.573 --> 02:23:36.507
THINGS THAT WE THINK IS REALLY

02:23:36.574 --> 02:23:39.310
CRITICAL IS. THAT WE THAT WE

02:23:39.377 --> 02:23:40.611
REQUIRE THAT PROGRAMS BE

02:23:40.678 --> 02:23:42.146
EVIDENCE BASED NATURALLY A TWO

02:23:42.213 --> 02:23:44.816
STEP PROCESS FIRST AND THIS IS

02:23:44.882 --> 02:23:46.384
SOMETHING THAT CDC ARE HAS AN

02:23:46.451 --> 02:23:47.652
ODD DEFINITELY IMPROVED IN

02:23:47.719 --> 02:23:49.520
RECENT YEARS TO CHOOSE PROGRAMS

02:23:49.587 --> 02:23:51.255
HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE EFFECTIVE

02:23:51.322 --> 02:23:53.191
ELSEWHERE. BUT THE SECOND AND

02:23:53.257 --> 02:23:55.893
GOAL STEP IN THAT PROCESS IS

02:23:55.960 --> 02:23:57.328
ENSURING THAT THE PROGRAMS THAT

02:23:57.395 --> 02:23:58.696
WE CHOOSE OUR ACTUALLY BE

02:23:58.763 --> 02:24:01.099
OPERATED IN A WAY THAT SIMILAR

02:24:01.165 --> 02:24:02.400
TO THE WAY THEY WERE. AMENDED

02:24:02.467 --> 02:24:03.835
OUT WHERE THIS CALLED A

02:24:03.901 --> 02:24:05.837
FIDELITY ASSESS AND CITIES HERE

02:24:05.903 --> 02:24:06.804
IS IN THE PROCESS OF TRYING TO

02:24:06.871 --> 02:24:09.674
BEGAN. THE PROCESS OF

02:24:09.741 --> 02:24:10.141
IMPLEMENTING FIDELITY

02:24:10.208 --> 02:24:13.211
ASSESSMENTS. WE ALSO THINK

02:24:13.277 --> 02:24:13.945
THOUGH THAT BEYOND THAT IT'S

02:24:14.012 --> 02:24:16.214
CALLED ACTUALLY LOOK AT IN THE

02:24:16.280 --> 02:24:18.116
WAY THAT THE ORDER DID WITH

02:24:18.182 --> 02:24:19.751
RESPECT TO SOME CDC OUR

02:24:19.817 --> 02:24:20.618
PROGRAMS. THE ACTUAL

02:24:20.685 --> 02:24:23.454
STATISTICAL FACT ON INMATES

02:24:23.521 --> 02:24:24.722
THAT ARE IN THE PROGRAMS

02:24:24.789 --> 02:24:25.957
BECAUSE JUST BECAUSE A PROGRAM

02:24:26.024 --> 02:24:27.658
WORK SOMEWHERE ELSE WE NEED THE

02:24:27.725 --> 02:24:30.895
ISSUE BUT IT ALSO IN HERE SO

02:24:30.962 --> 02:24:35.733
THAT FITS NOT INTO A LOOK AT

02:24:35.800 --> 02:24:40.738
HER FIGURE HOW. RAM COULD BE MY

02:24:40.805 --> 02:24:42.306
THEY'RE NOT OTHER PROGRAM WOULD

02:24:42.373 --> 02:24:53.017
BE MORE OF. THE THING. IS

02:24:53.084 --> 02:24:54.685
RESEARCH SHOWS THAT PROGRAMS

02:24:54.752 --> 02:24:57.855
HIGHER HIGH INMATES THE OF WAY

02:24:57.922 --> 02:24:58.656
TO REHABILITATED PROGRAM AND

02:24:58.723 --> 02:25:00.558
WILL CDC OURS RIGHT. ARE PUT IN

02:25:00.625 --> 02:25:01.492
PLACE TO TRY TO IN THIS IN MANY

02:25:01.559 --> 02:25:02.794
THE BREAKS THE AND SO WE THINK

02:25:02.860 --> 02:25:03.694
VARIOUS WAY THAT THIS COULD AND

02:25:03.761 --> 02:25:05.663
A ENSURING HIRING HIGH NEED I

02:25:05.730 --> 02:25:07.765
AT GET IN PRO IN OUR FOR IT WE

02:25:07.832 --> 02:25:09.567
ALSO THING THAT IT'S CRITICAL

02:25:09.634 --> 02:25:10.768
THAT THE STATE TAKE A LOOK AT

02:25:10.835 --> 02:25:12.603
ITS INFRASTRUCTURE TO ENSURE IT

02:25:12.670 --> 02:25:14.305
ACTUALLY HAS THE CAPACITY TO

02:25:14.372 --> 02:25:16.340
MEET THE NEEDS OF HIGH RISK

02:25:16.407 --> 02:25:17.341
HIGH NEED INMATES RIGHT NOW

02:25:17.408 --> 02:25:18.509
IT'S NOT CLEAR IF WE ACTUALLY

02:25:18.576 --> 02:25:21.379
HAVE THE SPACE AVAILABLE TO

02:25:21.446 --> 02:25:24.348
MEET EVERYONE'S NEEDS THAT WE

02:25:24.415 --> 02:25:25.650
HAVE BEEN IN THE PROCESS OF

02:25:25.716 --> 02:25:27.418
ADDING ABOUT EITHER AS A-

02:25:27.485 --> 02:25:32.423
ASSIST. ATTIC ASSESSED WHAT. BE

02:25:32.490 --> 02:25:34.058
B. AND OF CLASSROOMS. AND

02:25:34.125 --> 02:25:35.827
TREATMENTS BY NOW. TO ACTUALLY

02:25:35.893 --> 02:25:36.861
ADDRESS OLD NEEDS THAT GO ON

02:25:36.928 --> 02:25:39.363
MATT AND THEN FOR. WE ALSO

02:25:39.430 --> 02:25:40.765
THINK THAT THE STATE COULD

02:25:40.832 --> 02:25:42.600
IMPROVE BY AND- IMPLEMENTING-

02:25:42.667 --> 02:25:44.535
PERFORMANCE MEASURES TO SORT OF

02:25:44.602 --> 02:25:46.471
CONDUCT REGULAR OVERSIGHT OVER

02:25:46.537 --> 02:25:47.672
PROGRAMS A LOT OF THE COST

02:25:47.738 --> 02:25:49.440
EFFECTIVENESS EVALUATIONS CAN

02:25:49.507 --> 02:25:50.575
TAKE YEARS TO DO AND SO IT'S

02:25:50.641 --> 02:25:52.510
IMPORTANT TO. SORT OF MAINTAIN

02:25:52.577 --> 02:25:53.478
CONSTANT OVERSIGHT OVER THE

02:25:53.544 --> 02:25:55.279
PROGRAMS AND I'D BE HAPPY TO

02:25:55.346 --> 02:25:58.149

STRICTLY RAISED AND- QUESTIONS

02:26:24.475 --> 02:26:26.577
ABOUT- WHAT'S TRADING OR

02:26:26.644 --> 02:26:28.112
INCREASED COSTS- HEALTHCARE

02:26:28.179 --> 02:26:30.515
CAME- WAS SPECIFICALLY

02:26:30.581 --> 02:26:34.185
REFERENCES THE FIRST ITEM. SO

02:26:34.252 --> 02:26:35.453
IT IS SO I GUESS MY QUESTION

02:26:35.520 --> 02:26:38.256
IS- MORE BROADLY IS A WHAT KIND

02:26:38.322 --> 02:26:41.058
OF PROPOSALS AND I KNOW THAT

02:26:41.125 --> 02:26:42.160
THERE'S GONNA BE DIGGING INTO

02:26:42.226 --> 02:26:44.462
MATTERS BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE BUT

02:26:44.529 --> 02:26:45.029
SINCE I CHAIRED THE MEDI CAL

02:26:45.096 --> 02:26:46.931
SIDE OF THINGS- WHAT KIND OF

02:26:46.998 --> 02:26:48.499
THINGS WILL BE LOOKING AT TO

02:26:48.566 --> 02:26:50.201
TRY TO BEND THE CURVE ON

02:26:50.268 --> 02:26:52.937
SPENDING ON THE- HEALTH. CARE

02:26:53.004 --> 02:26:54.305
THAT I KNOW THAT SOME OF ITS

02:26:54.372 --> 02:26:55.473
HUNDRED RECEIVERSHIP- AND

02:26:55.540 --> 02:26:58.743
THAT'S YEAH. BUT I GUESS SOME

02:26:58.809 --> 02:26:59.644
OF THE QUESTIONS WOULD BE ONE

02:26:59.710 --> 02:27:02.079
IS THAT-IF THERE'S A WAY TO

02:27:02.146 --> 02:27:04.015
YOU CAN'T HAVE THEM ON MEDI CAL

02:27:04.081 --> 02:27:05.783
WHEN THEY'RE INCARCERATED BUT-

02:27:05.850 --> 02:27:07.685

RIGHT- POTENTIALLY OR- I GUESS

02:27:15.993 --> 02:27:17.795
THE OTHER THING IS THAT GIVEN.

02:27:17.862 --> 02:27:18.896
THE CURRENT DEMOGRAPHICS OF THE

02:27:18.963 --> 02:27:20.398
POPULATION I MEAN YOU KNOW WHAT

02:27:20.464 --> 02:27:22.133
THE DEMOGRAPHICS ARE AT LEAST

02:27:22.200 --> 02:27:23.734
FOR RIGHT NOW AND PROBABLY THE

02:27:23.801 --> 02:27:25.770
PEOPLE COMING IN OR NOT THAT

THE OLDER AND AS PRIDE THE

02:27:26.370 --> 02:27:27.772
YOUNGER AND- A WHAT IS

02:27:27.838 --> 02:27:30.675
PROJECTION. ON THE CURVE ON OF

02:27:30.741 --> 02:27:31.809
WHERE THE HEALTHCARE COSTS ARE

02:27:31.876 --> 02:27:33.911
GOING TO GO- GIVEN WHAT YOU

KNOW NOW SO DO WE KNOW WHAT

02:27:35.546 --> 02:27:37.215
THAT CURVE LOOKS LIKE IN TERMS

02:27:37.281 --> 02:27:38.416
OF. WHEN WE START THINKING

02:27:38.482 --> 02:27:41.219
ABOUT HOW YEARS. AND THEN

02:27:41.285 --> 02:27:44.589
FINALLY. IT WITH THE ONE GOALS

02:27:44.655 --> 02:27:47.124
IS TO CLOSE A STATE PRISON OR-

02:27:47.191 --> 02:27:49.560
AND- AND FIVE YEARS AND- WE'RE

02:27:49.627 --> 02:27:50.861
ALSO TRYING TO REDUCE THE

THE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THE

02:28:01.606 --> 02:28:04.542
HEALTH CARE DELIVERY ALSO. NON

02:28:04.609 --> 02:28:06.344
LINEAR CELL RIGHT SO I GUESS

02:28:10.381 --> 02:28:13.517
PRISONER. RATES GOING DOWN- YOU

02:28:13.584 --> 02:28:15.253
KNOW THE COST IS INDUSTRY GOING

02:28:15.319 --> 02:28:16.020
DOWN SOME BECAUSE OF

02:28:16.087 --> 02:28:17.455
PROGRAMMING BUT SOME OF THIS

02:28:17.521 --> 02:28:18.089
BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO MAINTAIN A

02:28:18.155 --> 02:28:19.490
CERTAIN INFRASTRUCTURES UNTIL

02:28:19.557 --> 02:28:21.092
YOU ACTUALLY CLOSE A FACILITY.

02:28:21.158 --> 02:28:23.094
YOU WON'T SEE A SAVINGS. FROM

02:28:23.160 --> 02:28:24.462
THAT BECAUSE OF SPECIALLY HAS

02:28:24.528 --> 02:28:25.896
MEETING A CERTAIN AMOUNT. DOES

02:28:25.963 --> 02:28:27.231
THAT ALSO APPLY TO THE

02:28:27.298 --> 02:28:28.432
HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SIDE OF

02:28:28.499 --> 02:28:29.834
THINGS AS WELL SO WHAT'S THE

02:28:29.900 --> 02:28:31.736
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN. COSTS IN

02:28:31.802 --> 02:28:33.871
TERMS OF. HEALTH CARE FOR

02:28:33.938 --> 02:28:37.041
PRISONERS. AND NUMBER PRISONERS

02:28:37.108 --> 02:28:39.644
IS IT. IS IT IS IT. IS IT A

02:28:39.710 --> 02:28:41.646
LINEAR RELATIONSHIP ARE IS IT

02:28:41.712 --> 02:28:44.081
NOT AND IT'S ACTUALLY WE CLOSE

02:28:44.148 --> 02:28:45.082
OF SILLY WILL. BE ON THE THAT

02:28:45.149 --> 02:28:47.184
WE DON'T HAVE TO. NINE DOCTORS

02:28:47.251 --> 02:28:48.653
AND NURSES. WHO HAVE TO GO OUT

02:28:48.719 --> 02:28:50.388
SYSTEM THE PENNY ON. THE AND

02:28:50.454 --> 02:28:52.089
ARE YOU TO HAVE THE ANY ON

02:28:52.156 --> 02:28:54.392
LOCATION OF SILLY. YOU MAY BE

02:28:54.458 --> 02:28:56.560
ABLE TO AT. PEOPLE WHO IS A

02:28:56.627 --> 02:28:58.963
RECRUIT FOR. HIM AS MUCH OR

02:28:59.030 --> 02:29:05.102
WHATEVER ELSE I DON'T IT. SO I

02:29:05.169 --> 02:29:06.570
HAVE PEOPLE IN THE- WELL.

02:29:06.637 --> 02:29:08.105
EXACTLY SO YES THERE'S I'D SO

02:29:08.172 --> 02:29:09.774
WITH THERE A WAY TO GET. ON TO

02:29:09.840 --> 02:29:11.742
YOU KNOW OUR OF THIS. PRESENTS

02:29:11.809 --> 02:29:13.711
THE MEDIC WHAT THE LOOKING AT

02:29:13.778 --> 02:29:14.345
THE DEMOGRAPHICS WHAT'S THE- ON

02:29:14.412 --> 02:29:15.513
HEALTH CARE AND- WHAT IT OPERA.

02:29:15.579 --> 02:29:18.282
AND IS REALLY BETWEEN PRISONERS.

02:29:18.349 --> 02:29:20.318
OBVIOUSLY JUSTIN FOR ASIAN SOME

02:29:20.384 --> 02:29:21.118
OTHER THINGS RELATE HEALTH

02:29:21.185 --> 02:29:24.422
CONDITIONS AND ARE SPENDING ON

02:29:24.488 --> 02:29:25.022
HEALTH CARE WITHIN THE PRISON

02:29:25.089 --> 02:29:29.593
SYSTEM. SO I COULD TAKE A- STAB

02:29:29.660 --> 02:29:31.262
AT. UNPACKING SOME OF THAT

02:29:31.329 --> 02:29:32.530
THERE'S A THERE'S A COME A FEW

02:29:32.596 --> 02:29:34.165
POINTS THERE SO- LET ME JUST

02:29:34.231 --> 02:29:36.067
START WITH- ADD YOUR COMMENTS

02:29:36.133 --> 02:29:37.601
ABOUT THAT. THE INCREASING COST

02:29:37.668 --> 02:29:39.670
HER FOR HEALTH CARE- YOU'RE

02:29:39.737 --> 02:29:41.439
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT IT IS A

02:29:41.505 --> 02:29:44.108
GROWING AREA OF EXPENDITURE FOR

02:29:44.175 --> 02:29:47.011
US- AND IT IS ONE IN WHICH- WE

02:29:47.078 --> 02:29:48.913
DO HAVE- AS AN ADMINISTRATION

02:29:48.979 --> 02:29:50.748
LIMITED CONTROL BECAUSE OF THE

02:29:50.815 --> 02:29:52.416
FEDERAL RECEIVERSHIP OVER-

02:29:52.483 --> 02:29:54.685
PRISON MEDICAL CARE- I THINK

02:29:54.752 --> 02:29:56.921
WHAT'S- REALLY UNDERLYING SOME

02:29:56.987 --> 02:29:59.457
OF THESE INCREASES IS THE- THE

02:29:59.523 --> 02:30:01.692
AGING POPULATION THAT WE HAVE-

02:30:01.759 --> 02:30:04.095
AND- IN THIS KIND OF GETS TO

02:30:04.161 --> 02:30:05.696
CENTER SKINNER'S QUESTION FROM.

02:30:05.763 --> 02:30:08.265
EARLIER AS WELL- THE ELSE IN

02:30:08.332 --> 02:30:10.868
THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE SO HERE

02:30:10.935 --> 02:30:15.239
THE ANSWER NOW. SURE IN I THINK.

02:30:15.306 --> 02:30:16.874
THE PERSON POP IS AGING IS IN

02:30:16.941 --> 02:30:18.576
PART BECAUSE OF YOU KNOW THE

02:30:18.642 --> 02:30:20.611
UPTAKE THAT THAT WE HAD IN

02:30:20.678 --> 02:30:22.012
SENTENCE LANES GOING BACK

02:30:22.079 --> 02:30:24.048
DECADES REALLY AND TO THE IN

02:30:24.115 --> 02:30:25.383
THE EIGHTIES AND NINETIES WHEN

02:30:25.449 --> 02:30:28.719
WE STARTED- SORT TOUGHER ON

02:30:28.786 --> 02:30:30.321
TOUGH ON CRIME POLICIES LIKE

02:30:30.388 --> 02:30:31.756
THREE STRIKES LAW I THINK WHAT

02:30:31.822 --> 02:30:33.057
WE'RE SEEING NOW IS REALLY THE

02:30:33.124 --> 02:30:34.859
TAIL END OF THAT- AND BECAUSE

02:30:34.925 --> 02:30:37.228
IT TOOK US A DECADE TO GET INTO

02:30:37.294 --> 02:30:38.462
THE SITUATION I DON'T THINK WE

02:30:38.529 --> 02:30:39.630
HAVE ANY SOLUTIONS TO GET OUT.

02:30:39.697 --> 02:30:42.666
OVER NIGHT UNFORTUNATELY- SO I

02:30:42.733 --> 02:30:45.903
THINK- THE AS AS WAS NOTED

02:30:45.970 --> 02:30:47.004
EARLIER BY SOME OF THE

02:30:47.071 --> 02:30:48.939
PANELISTS I THINK THE DECISIONS

02:30:49.006 --> 02:30:50.408
AROUND PAROLE AND MAKING SURE

02:30:50.474 --> 02:30:52.777
THAT- GIVING PEOPLE ADEQUATE

02:30:52.843 --> 02:30:54.812
CONSIDERATION FOR PAROLE- WILL

02:30:54.879 --> 02:30:57.281
HELP OVER TIME TO REDUCE- SOME

02:30:57.348 --> 02:30:59.817
OF THE AGING IN THE PRISON

02:30:59.884 --> 02:31:02.720
POPULATION AND HAVING FOLKS GO

02:31:02.787 --> 02:31:06.257
OUT THE BACK DOOR. I'M YOUR

02:31:06.323 --> 02:31:08.659
CALL ABOUT UTILIZING CAL SO THE

02:31:08.726 --> 02:31:11.328
DEPARTMENT HAS ACTUALLY- DONE I

02:31:11.395 --> 02:31:12.830
THINK A VERY GOOD JOB OF

02:31:12.897 --> 02:31:14.432
UTILIZING MEDI CAL FOR

02:31:14.498 --> 02:31:16.000
OUTPATIENT SERVICES SO WHEN WE

02:31:16.066 --> 02:31:18.068
SEND AN INMATE. OUT TO A

02:31:18.135 --> 02:31:20.404
HOSPITAL FOR- INPATIENT CARE

02:31:20.471 --> 02:31:21.939
LASTING TWENTY FOUR HOURS OR

02:31:22.006 --> 02:31:23.774
MORE. WE CAN CLAIM MEDI CAL

02:31:23.841 --> 02:31:24.975
REIMBURSEMENT FOR THAT

02:31:25.042 --> 02:31:26.877
TREATMENT BECAUSE IN THAT CASE

02:31:26.944 --> 02:31:28.546
THEY ARE NOT CONSIDERED AN

02:31:28.612 --> 02:31:29.447
INMATE ANY LONGER BECAUSE

02:31:29.513 --> 02:31:31.081
THEY'RE OFF OF THE PRISON

02:31:31.148 --> 02:31:33.250
GROUNDS- THERE ARE LIMITATIONS

02:31:33.317 --> 02:31:35.419
TO THAT OF COURSE- YOU KNOW I

02:31:35.486 --> 02:31:38.722
THINK. FOR OUTPATIENT SERVICES

02:31:38.789 --> 02:31:40.257
WE WERE NOT ABLE TO CLAIM

02:31:40.324 --> 02:31:42.993
REIMBURSEMENT UNDER MEDICO- WE

02:31:43.060 --> 02:31:45.496
HAVE LOOKED AT- USING MEDI CAL

02:31:45.563 --> 02:31:47.598
FOR OUR- INMATES THAT WERE

02:31:47.665 --> 02:31:49.099
HOLDING AND THE- REENTRY

02:31:49.166 --> 02:31:50.901
FACILITIES IN THE COMMUNITY.

02:31:50.968 --> 02:31:52.236
WHICH ARE SORT OF OUR

02:31:52.303 --> 02:31:53.170
TRANSITIONAL HOUSING

02:31:53.237 --> 02:31:55.272
FACILITIES- UNFORTUNATELY THE

02:31:55.339 --> 02:31:57.441
DETERMINATION FROM- THE FEDERAL

02:31:57.508 --> 02:31:59.910
GOVERNMENT- WAS THAT THE

02:31:59.977 --> 02:32:02.179
INMATES. WERE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR

02:32:02.246 --> 02:32:03.981
MEDI CAL BECAUSE- I THINK THAT

02:32:04.048 --> 02:32:05.649
THE KEY CRITERIA THAT LOOK AT

02:32:05.716 --> 02:32:07.451
THIS THE FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT-

02:32:07.518 --> 02:32:10.754
AND BECAUSE OF THE- SECURITY-

02:32:10.821 --> 02:32:12.223
CONCERNS AROUND THOSE

02:32:12.289 --> 02:32:13.958
FACILITIES THAT THOSE. THOSE

02:32:14.024 --> 02:32:14.959
INDIVIDUALS ARE STILL UNDER THE

02:32:15.025 --> 02:32:17.361
CUSTODY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF

02:32:17.428 --> 02:32:20.264
CORRECTIONS AND WE HAVE TO-

02:32:20.331 --> 02:32:21.699
ENSURE THE COMMUNITY BUT THERE

02:32:21.765 --> 02:32:26.604
ARE. IN UPSET FROM THE SOME

02:32:26.670 --> 02:32:27.872
RISK IS ABOUT FREEDOM OF

02:32:27.938 --> 02:32:29.874
MOVEMENT AND SO. WE NEED TO

02:32:29.940 --> 02:32:30.641
BALANCE THAT WITH THINK ABOUT

02:32:30.708 --> 02:32:32.409
THE CAR SAVINGS OF. WHILE AND

02:32:32.476 --> 02:32:40.618
THEN. WE'RE QUESTION THIS WILL

02:32:40.684 --> 02:32:41.185
BE A THIRTY THE HEALTH KERR

02:32:41.252 --> 02:32:43.687
ACOSTA CURVE ON. ALLUDED TO THE

02:32:43.754 --> 02:32:44.588
THAT NO IT IS IT IS NOW LINEAR

02:32:44.655 --> 02:32:46.156
SO AS WE CALL THE STATE PRISON

02:32:46.223 --> 02:32:47.658
IT'S NOT GOING TO RELATE TO A

02:32:47.725 --> 02:32:48.692
YOU KNOW PER. DECLINE IN HEALTH

02:32:48.759 --> 02:32:51.629
CARE. NAKED GETS BY TO WHO ARE

02:32:51.695 --> 02:32:52.463
THE WHO ARE DRIVING THE

02:32:52.530 --> 02:32:54.698
HEALTHCARE COSTS IT'S THE AGING

02:32:54.765 --> 02:32:56.667
FOLKS IN AND IT'S SIMILAR TO

02:32:56.734 --> 02:32:57.601
WHAT WE SEE IN THE COMMUNITY IN

02:32:57.668 --> 02:32:59.203
TERMS OF. A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF

02:32:59.270 --> 02:33:00.638
OUR AND IT'S A REALLY DEPRIVING

02:33:00.704 --> 02:33:03.107
THE MAJORITY OF THE COST AND SO

02:33:03.173 --> 02:33:04.441
UNTIL WE KIND OF GET AT THAT

02:33:04.508 --> 02:33:07.611
ISSUE- THE IT'S UNLIKELY THAT

02:33:07.678 --> 02:33:09.847
SIGNIFICANTLY BEND THE COST

02:33:09.914 --> 02:33:11.982
CURVE. AND JUST REACH- ANY OF

02:33:12.049 --> 02:33:13.250
THESE PRISONERS SOLD

02:33:13.317 --> 02:33:16.854
ESSENTIALLY PROVIDING NURSING

02:33:16.921 --> 02:33:17.454
HOME CARE FOR THEM WITHIN THE

02:33:17.521 --> 02:33:20.357
PRISON. I IT DOES. OF A CAR ON

02:33:20.424 --> 02:33:22.726
K. A IN ON THE CAL HEALTH CARE

02:33:22.793 --> 02:33:24.962
FACILITY IN STOCKTON WE HAVE-

02:33:25.029 --> 02:33:26.397
ESSENTIALLY SKILLED NURSING

02:33:26.463 --> 02:33:30.801
CARE LEVEL- BEDS THERE SO- IN

02:33:30.868 --> 02:33:31.869
ESSENCE YES I THINK THERE ARE

02:33:31.936 --> 02:33:33.137
SOME SOME NUMBER OF BEDS THAT

02:33:33.203 --> 02:33:34.538
THAT'S THE CASE. WE ALSO HAVE

02:33:34.605 --> 02:33:36.707
HOSPICE BEDS THAT. CALIFORNIA

02:33:36.774 --> 02:33:38.809
MEN'S FACILITY VACAVILLE- OF

02:33:38.876 --> 02:33:40.878
SORRY I KNOW YOU TALKED TO BE

02:33:40.945 --> 02:33:42.346
IN THAT. YEAH I THINK FOR THE

02:33:42.413 --> 02:33:43.514
RECORD WE FACTOR TALKING THE

02:33:43.581 --> 02:33:47.885
MICROPHONE BUT- SORRY. I WILL

02:33:47.952 --> 02:33:48.485
BE OFFENDED THAT YOUR TALK TO

02:33:48.552 --> 02:33:50.654
MICHAEL A LITTLE. BEYOND THAT

02:33:50.721 --> 02:33:52.523
CENTER PAN IS A- THE PART AT

02:33:52.590 --> 02:33:53.958
WITH IT HEALTH CARE SO. AND

02:33:54.024 --> 02:33:56.594
THERE'S OFF WE HAVE ELIMINATED-

02:33:56.660 --> 02:33:57.962
THE REQUIREMENT OF COPAYS FOR

02:33:58.028 --> 02:34:00.364
INMATES SO IT DOES NOT

02:34:00.431 --> 02:34:01.532
DISCOURAGE INMATES SEEKING

02:34:01.599 --> 02:34:03.801
ACCESS TO OUR- AND I ALSO NEED

02:34:03.867 --> 02:34:05.069
TO SAY JUST FROM AN OPERATIONAL

02:34:05.135 --> 02:34:06.604
PERSPECTIVE THE ACCESS TO

02:34:06.670 --> 02:34:08.038
HEALTH CARE. IS MORE OF AN

02:34:08.105 --> 02:34:09.840
OPERATIONAL DECISION NOW THAT

02:34:09.907 --> 02:34:11.208
WE HAVE MADE THAT AMENDED

02:34:11.275 --> 02:34:13.110
MANDATE AND THAT IS PRIORITY

02:34:13.177 --> 02:34:14.111
NUMBER ONE I KNOW SAFETY

02:34:14.178 --> 02:34:16.146
SECURITIES. IN A PARAMOUNT BUT

02:34:16.213 --> 02:34:17.348
WHEN IT COMES TO HEALTH CARE

02:34:17.414 --> 02:34:18.215
AND ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE

02:34:18.282 --> 02:34:21.051
APPOINTMENTS- THE DESTRUCTION

02:34:21.118 --> 02:34:22.753
OF THAT- WE HAVE DRASTICALLY

02:34:22.820 --> 02:34:24.655
MINIMIZE WERE ALMOST ELIMINATED

02:34:24.722 --> 02:34:27.324
BECAUSE THAT IS A PRIORITY- AND

02:34:27.391 --> 02:34:28.459
ONE WOULD THINK THAT YOU KNOW

02:34:28.525 --> 02:34:29.793
IF SOMETHING HAPPENS ON A

02:34:29.860 --> 02:34:31.028
PRISON YARD. EVERYTHING IS SHUT

02:34:31.095 --> 02:34:32.162
DOWN AND CLEAN HEALTHCARE

02:34:32.229 --> 02:34:33.964
THAT'S NOT THE CASE RECOGNIZE

02:34:34.031 --> 02:34:35.766
THAT WE HAVE TO GET THESE IMAGE

02:34:35.833 --> 02:34:37.334
TO THEIR HEALTHCARE SERVICES-

02:34:37.401 --> 02:34:38.936
TO A MISTER JOHNSON'S POINT AND

02:34:39.003 --> 02:34:41.905
IT'S- IT'S REALLY BASIC- WHAT

02:34:41.972 --> 02:34:45.442
WE FEED IN MAKES. HOW FRIEDMAN.

02:34:45.509 --> 02:34:48.912
THE LEVEL OF THE SEE. WE HAVE

02:34:48.979 --> 02:34:49.847
IMPROVE AND WE ARE SERVING A

02:34:49.913 --> 02:34:51.815
HARD HEALTHY. IT IS NOT THE

02:34:51.882 --> 02:34:56.954
MOST POPULAR. AT THE END

02:34:57.021 --> 02:35:00.791
POPULAR. BUT I WE DID OUR

02:35:00.858 --> 02:35:01.659
TRYING TO MOVE AWAY FOR OUR

02:35:01.725 --> 02:35:02.993
BEHIND GREAT. AND YOU KNOW MANY

02:35:03.060 --> 02:35:03.927
OF SUITES WE USED PROVIDE DO

02:35:03.994 --> 02:35:05.162
PROVIDE SWEETS PASSED OUT AT

02:35:05.229 --> 02:35:06.196
THE WE READ. THAT IT'S THIS A

02:35:06.263 --> 02:35:08.132
DIRECT CALL. JIM THEY EAT. AND

02:35:08.198 --> 02:35:08.966
HEALTH CARE SERVICES. THE

02:35:09.033 --> 02:35:10.801
CHALLENGE POINT IS- WE ARE

WITHIN THE DIVISION OF ADULT

02:35:32.756 --> 02:35:34.224
INSTITUTIONS ON A RECENT TRIP

02:35:34.291 --> 02:35:36.093
TO NORWAY. THAT WAS A CONCEPT

02:35:36.160 --> 02:35:38.696
OVER THERE THAT- ALL HEART

THAT THIS MORE FOR THE DIRECTOR

OF ANOTHER ADULT OPERATIONS BUT

02:35:54.912 --> 02:35:56.780
THAT'S AN OPTION- I KNOW IT

WILL GOAL IT MY NUMBER. THE

02:35:58.248 --> 02:35:59.917
MOST POPULAR THING BUT WE HAVE

02:35:59.983 --> 02:36:01.552
TO TRY SOMETHING DIFFERENT. AND

02:36:01.618 --> 02:36:04.588
THEN LASTLY WE- IMPLEMENTED.

02:36:04.655 --> 02:36:06.657
SOME YEARS AGO- IN AN EFFORT TO

02:36:06.724 --> 02:36:08.258
REDUCE OUR STDS AND

02:36:08.325 --> 02:36:10.561
INSTITUTIONS WE DID- WE DID

02:36:10.627 --> 02:36:12.162
IMPLEMENT A CONDOM- PROGRAM

02:36:12.229 --> 02:36:16.633
INSTEAD OF INSTITUTIONS RIGHT.

02:36:16.700 --> 02:36:18.836
SELECT A JUST JUST ON A BIT AND

02:36:18.902 --> 02:36:19.903
OF YOUR- OF HOW TO REDUCE

02:36:19.970 --> 02:36:21.905
MISTER. IS ABSOLUTELY CORRECT

02:36:21.972 --> 02:36:23.640
APARTMENT DOES DRAW DOWN SOME

02:36:23.707 --> 02:36:25.509
MEDI CAL HOWEVER WE'VE BEEN

02:36:25.576 --> 02:36:27.144
MONITORING THE RATE AT WHICH

02:36:27.211 --> 02:36:28.445
THE DEPARTMENT IS I'M TRYING

02:36:28.512 --> 02:36:30.114
DOWN MEDICAL AND IT DOESN'T

02:36:30.180 --> 02:36:32.316
SEEM TO LINE UP IN THE WAY WE

02:36:32.382 --> 02:36:35.686
WOULD HOPE. WITH THE LEVEL OF-

02:36:35.753 --> 02:36:37.521
INPATIENT SERVICES THAT ARE

02:36:37.588 --> 02:36:38.889
DELIVERED IN THE COMMUNITY WE

02:36:38.956 --> 02:36:40.624
HAVE NOT ARRIVED AT-

02:36:40.691 --> 02:36:41.992
IDENTIFICATION OF WHAT THE

02:36:42.059 --> 02:36:43.894
BARRIERS ARE TO INCREASING IT

02:36:43.961 --> 02:36:44.895
OR INDEED IF IT COULD BE

02:36:44.962 --> 02:36:47.231
INCREASED SO RIGHT NOW. THE ON

02:36:47.297 --> 02:36:49.566
ADMINISTRATION IS REQUESTING-

02:36:49.633 --> 02:36:51.435
SOME FUNDING TO SUPPORT

02:36:51.502 --> 02:36:52.970
CONTRACT MEDICAL SERVICES WHICH

02:36:53.036 --> 02:36:54.872
INCLUDE THESE TYPE OF SERVICES.

02:36:54.938 --> 02:36:56.373
AND SO WE'RE WITHHOLDING

02:36:56.440 --> 02:36:58.909
RECOMMENDATION ON THAT- WELL WE

02:36:58.976 --> 02:37:00.210
WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT TO TRY

02:37:00.277 --> 02:37:02.079
TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY CAN DO

02:37:02.146 --> 02:37:03.680
TO INCREASE THAT AMOUNT OR IF

02:37:03.747 --> 02:37:04.948
THERE ARE BARRIERS THAT CAN BE

02:37:05.015 --> 02:37:06.350
REMOVED TO TRY TO INCREASE THAT

02:37:06.416 --> 02:37:08.085
AMOUNT. IN TERMS OF- YOUR

02:37:08.152 --> 02:37:09.987
QUESTION ABOUT WHERE WILL THE

02:37:10.053 --> 02:37:12.923
COSCO- GIVEN THAT WERE STILL IN

02:37:12.990 --> 02:37:14.491
THE MIDST OF THE RECEIVERSHIP

02:37:14.558 --> 02:37:16.193
AND ONLY ROUGHLY A DOZEN- ON

02:37:16.260 --> 02:37:18.962
INSTITUTIONS HAVE BEEN

02:37:19.029 --> 02:37:19.763
DELEGATED SO ESSENTIALLY THE

02:37:19.830 --> 02:37:21.231
PROCESS OF GETTING OUT OF THE

02:37:21.298 --> 02:37:22.866
RECEIVERSHIP. REQUIRES THE

02:37:22.933 --> 02:37:24.701
RECEIVER DELHI EIGHT. BILLION

02:37:24.768 --> 02:37:30.641
SO. THAT KERN. ON CAN BY

02:37:30.707 --> 02:37:33.577
RECEIVER. TWITCHES KERN ROD IT

02:37:33.644 --> 02:37:35.345
OR SO OKAY AS PART IF YOU ARE.

02:37:35.412 --> 02:37:37.347
ON A THEN ALSO. ANY OF THE-

02:37:37.414 --> 02:37:37.981
THAT THE RECEIVERS HAS TAKE IN

02:37:38.048 --> 02:37:40.551
CAN. ARMS WE'RE STILL SO OF. A

02:37:40.617 --> 02:37:42.319
DID TO ESTIMATE WE THAT WILL.

02:37:42.386 --> 02:37:48.091
BUT WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH. THE

02:37:48.158 --> 02:37:49.059
DELEGATION OF ALL OF THOSE AND

02:37:49.126 --> 02:37:51.895
SO IT'S POSSIBLE THAT COST

02:37:51.962 --> 02:37:53.630
COULD INCREASE HOWEVER. BOB

02:37:53.697 --> 02:37:55.732
THERE IS. THERE IS A SIGNATURE

02:37:55.799 --> 02:37:56.600
CHANGE IN THE SIZE OF THE

02:37:56.667 --> 02:37:57.801
POPULATION. IT COULD OF THE M.

02:37:57.868 --> 02:38:00.270
OF CA THAT THE STATE IS FOR.

02:38:00.337 --> 02:38:02.339
BUT I WOULD SAY THEY'RE SORT OF.

02:38:02.406 --> 02:38:05.509
MORE UPSET AND RISK THAN THERE

02:38:05.576 --> 02:38:07.578
IS. A LIKELIHOOD OF REDUCTION

02:38:07.644 --> 02:38:15.152
IN COST. ENTER OF YOUR QUESTION

02:38:15.219 --> 02:38:16.753
ABOUT THE RADIO HEALTH CARE STE

02:38:16.820 --> 02:38:17.721
I THINK IT IS FOR TO SAY THEY

02:38:17.788 --> 02:38:19.089
ARE ARE NOT. REAL WITH INMATES.

02:38:19.156 --> 02:38:19.690
FOR CA REASONS ONE BECAUSE OF

02:38:19.756 --> 02:38:20.691
THE FIX COSTS. FOR WE INVEST IN

02:38:20.757 --> 02:38:22.226
THE UC. HEALTH CARE FACILITY

02:38:22.292 --> 02:38:24.361
WHICH WAS A MAJOR EXPENDITURE

02:38:24.428 --> 02:38:26.697
OF FUNDS TO CREATE A LARGE-

02:38:26.763 --> 02:38:28.098
HOSPITAL LIKE SETTING FOR

02:38:28.165 --> 02:38:29.700
INMATES BUT IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT

02:38:29.766 --> 02:38:31.668
TO NOTE THAT. WITH CERTAIN

02:38:31.735 --> 02:38:33.537
EXCEPTIONS WHITE PROP THIRTY

02:38:33.604 --> 02:38:34.705
SIX MANY OF THE SENTENCING

02:38:34.771 --> 02:38:36.673
CHANGES HAVE REALLY AFFECTED

02:38:36.740 --> 02:38:39.243
SHORTER TERM INMATES- AND SO

02:38:39.309 --> 02:38:40.210
THERE'S SORT OF A

02:38:40.277 --> 02:38:41.912
DISPROPORTIONATELY LESS LIKELY

02:38:41.979 --> 02:38:45.382
TO AFFECT THE- LONG TERM MORE-

02:38:45.449 --> 02:38:47.651
THE END MEETS WERE AGING AND

02:38:47.718 --> 02:38:49.353
CONTRIBUTING TO HEALTH CARE

02:38:49.419 --> 02:38:50.220
COST IS PROPORTIONALLY SO IT'S

02:38:50.287 --> 02:38:52.155
ALSO. SEE WHAT NON LINEAR

02:38:52.222 --> 02:38:54.324
BECAUSE OF THE RELATIONSHIP

02:38:54.391 --> 02:38:55.459
WELL. I GUESS WE SAY THE BOTTOM

02:38:55.525 --> 02:38:56.360
OF A THROW AWAY THE KEY THEN

02:38:56.426 --> 02:38:59.930
WE'RE PAYING FOR ALL OF IT.

02:38:59.997 --> 02:39:02.699
YEAH OKAY. BUT THAT THANK YOU

02:39:02.766 --> 02:39:03.700
SO MUCH FOR YOUR ANSWERS I IT

02:39:03.767 --> 02:39:05.102
LOOKS. TO YOU KNOW I'M SURE OF

02:39:05.168 --> 02:39:07.371
PRESENTED MORE BUT WHICH FOLLOW

02:39:07.437 --> 02:39:09.139
ALONG. AND SEEING WHAT WE CAN

02:39:09.206 --> 02:39:11.174
TRY TO DO TO ADDRESS THAT I

02:39:11.241 --> 02:39:12.409
GUESS THE ONE OTHER MAYBE FOR

02:39:12.476 --> 02:39:14.811
IF I MAY JUST ONE BRIEF SO. WE

02:39:14.878 --> 02:39:16.680
TALK ABOUT RECEIVERSHIP AND WE

02:39:16.747 --> 02:39:17.547
HAVE THE YOU KNOW WITH EACH

02:39:17.614 --> 02:39:19.950
FACILITY BUT I. PRESUME AND

02:39:20.017 --> 02:39:22.152
LESS WE THINK RECEIVERS FOR THE

02:39:22.219 --> 02:39:23.620
SPENDING LOTS OF EXTRA MONEY

02:39:23.687 --> 02:39:25.522
THAT THE SPENDING ONCE THEY'VE

02:39:25.589 --> 02:39:26.990
SILLY MOVES OUT OF RECEIVERSHIP

02:39:27.057 --> 02:39:28.125
STILL STAYS APPROXIMATELY THE

02:39:28.191 --> 02:39:30.694
SAME ADJUSTED FOR OF NUMBER OF.

02:39:30.761 --> 02:39:33.463
IS IN AGENTS FORTH THAT THAT

02:39:33.530 --> 02:39:36.266
THAT THAT THE RETURN. THREE

02:39:36.333 --> 02:39:36.833
EIGHTY NINE. WE SHOULD BE

02:39:36.900 --> 02:39:39.269
EXPECTING EIGHT. DROP INS

02:39:39.336 --> 02:39:40.337
HEALTHCARE SPENDING JUST

02:39:40.404 --> 02:39:41.905
BECAUSE OF GOES OUT A PURSE

02:39:41.972 --> 02:39:43.106
RECEIVERSHIP RIGHT I MEAN IT'S

02:39:43.173 --> 02:39:44.041
VERY REASON WE ENDED UP IN

02:39:44.107 --> 02:39:45.375
RECEIVERSHIP EXCELLENT DOING

02:39:45.442 --> 02:39:46.576
THE RIGHT THING CORRECT. THAT

02:39:46.643 --> 02:39:49.313
IS CORRECT- IT'S POSSIBLE THAT

02:39:49.379 --> 02:39:51.014
THERE'D BE A SOMEWHAT MINOR

02:39:51.081 --> 02:39:52.883
REDUCTION BECAUSE IN SOME CASES

02:39:52.950 --> 02:39:54.518
THERE'S SORT OF A DUPLICATION

02:39:54.584 --> 02:39:56.119
OF ADMINISTRATIVE

02:39:56.186 --> 02:39:57.688
INFRASTRUCTURE- AND WE MIGHT

02:39:57.754 --> 02:39:59.723
HAVE SOME FLEXIBILITY TO MAKE

02:39:59.790 --> 02:40:01.692
SOME DECISIONS THAT. WE WOULD

02:40:01.758 --> 02:40:03.393
LACK THAT ABILITY BUT ON THE

02:40:03.460 --> 02:40:05.228
WHOLE THERE SHOULD YOU USE YOU

02:40:05.295 --> 02:40:06.830
WOULD BE SURPRISED TO SEE A

02:40:06.897 --> 02:40:08.231
LARGE REDUCTION IN THE AND

02:40:08.298 --> 02:40:09.800
HEALTHCARE EXPENDITURES-

02:40:09.866 --> 02:40:11.368
BECAUSE WE NEED TO MAINTAIN THE

02:40:11.435 --> 02:40:12.602
LEVEL OF SERVICE THAT WE'RE

02:40:12.669 --> 02:40:14.404
PROVIDING ONCE WE SUCCESSFULLY-

02:40:14.471 --> 02:40:16.373
EXIT THE RECEIVERSHIP. THANK

02:40:16.440 --> 02:40:19.710
YOU THANKS FOR MUCH THANK YOU

02:40:19.776 --> 02:40:24.748
VERY MUCH CENTERVILLE.

02:40:24.815 --> 02:40:28.018
REGARDING THE HEALTH OF FUNDING

02:40:28.085 --> 02:40:34.424
I JUST SAID THE CHAIRS THE

02:40:34.491 --> 02:40:38.195
FEDERAL GOVERNMENTWHICH SAYS

02:40:38.261 --> 02:40:39.463
THAT THE MENTAL HEALTH BLOCK

02:40:39.529 --> 02:40:41.832
GRANT FEDERAL MENTAL HEALTH

02:40:41.898 --> 02:40:44.401
BLOCK GRANT CAN BE USE FOR

02:40:44.468 --> 02:40:46.803
INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS. SO I

02:40:46.870 --> 02:40:48.305
THINK WE OUGHT TO LOOK AT THE

02:40:48.372 --> 02:40:51.675
NEW FEDERAL. A RULE AND HOW

02:40:51.742 --> 02:40:55.912
THEY VIEW FUNDING PROGRAMS IN

02:40:55.979 --> 02:40:57.280
THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE RE

02:40:57.347 --> 02:40:59.349
ENTRY FACILITIES TO SEE IF WE

02:40:59.416 --> 02:41:03.653
COULD. INCLUDE THAT NEW POLICY

02:41:03.720 --> 02:41:07.057
IN OUR APPROACH TO FUNDING-

02:41:07.124 --> 02:41:10.127
MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAMS- WITH

02:41:10.193 --> 02:41:12.229
MEDICAID FUNDS AND OTHER.

02:41:12.295 --> 02:41:19.069
FEDERAL. HEALTHCARE FUNDS SO

02:41:19.136 --> 02:41:20.570
AND I LEAVE IT TO DOCTOR PLAN

02:41:20.637 --> 02:41:23.707
DO- EXAMINE THAT CLOSELY IN HIS

02:41:23.774 --> 02:41:27.377
COMMITTEE BUT BUT I THINK- IT'S

02:41:27.444 --> 02:41:29.413
VERY IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT.

02:41:29.479 --> 02:41:30.547
DIRECTION THAT ARE NOW TAKING

02:41:30.614 --> 02:41:32.549
THEIR NOW SAYING. YOU COULD

02:41:32.616 --> 02:41:33.984
TAKE THE MENTAL HEALTH BLOCK

02:41:34.051 --> 02:41:35.919
GRANT AND USE IT FOR FEDERAL

02:41:35.986 --> 02:41:38.922
FUNDS. OF WE HAVE A CHART FROM

02:41:38.989 --> 02:41:40.957
THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS

02:41:41.024 --> 02:41:43.126
IN THE FINANCE DEPARTMENT. WHO

02:41:43.193 --> 02:41:46.363
LISTING THE INMATE POPULATION-

02:41:46.430 --> 02:41:47.964
I WOULD LIKE ALL OF US TO LOOK

02:41:48.031 --> 02:41:50.867
AT THIS IS THE BASE CASE THAT

02:41:50.934 --> 02:41:52.135
WE'RE STARTING WITH NOW. OKAY

02:41:52.202 --> 02:41:54.604
IS THE BASE CASE SO WE WANT TO

02:41:54.671 --> 02:41:57.841
SEE WHAT STRATEGIES- AT

02:41:57.908 --> 02:42:00.177
ACTIVITIES WE CAN PROPOSE-

02:42:00.243 --> 02:42:02.512
THROUGH THIS BUDGET PROCESS-

02:42:02.579 --> 02:42:06.650
TO. REDUCE THE POPULATION. OF

02:42:06.716 --> 02:42:08.952
LEVELS IN OUR STATE PRISON OVER

02:42:09.019 --> 02:42:10.087
THE NEXT FIVE YEARS I THINK

02:42:10.153 --> 02:42:12.656
THE- THE STRATEGIES- IN THE

02:42:12.722 --> 02:42:16.526
OPTIONS. OF WE NEED TO LOOK AT

02:42:16.593 --> 02:42:17.961
WERE TALKED ABOUT LARGE A LOT

02:42:18.028 --> 02:42:20.864
TODAY- I APPRECIATE THE

02:42:20.931 --> 02:42:23.433
GOVERNOR'S DIRECTION ON HOUSING

02:42:23.500 --> 02:42:26.203
AND HOMELESSNESS- I'M

02:42:26.269 --> 02:42:27.304
INTERESTED IN WHAT THE NEW

02:42:27.370 --> 02:42:29.106
DIRECTION OF THE GOVERNOR WOULD

02:42:29.172 --> 02:42:34.811
BE. IN TERMS OF HOME LOS.

02:42:34.878 --> 02:42:36.079
FORMERLY INCARCERATED

02:42:36.146 --> 02:42:39.649
INDIVIDUALS ARE THERE A LOT OF

02:42:39.716 --> 02:42:43.019
ROOM CAN WE- SOMEHOW PUT THEM

02:42:43.086 --> 02:42:45.589
BACK INTO HOUSING. OF WILL

02:42:45.655 --> 02:42:47.124
PUTTING THEM BACK IN A HOUSING

COSTS OF PEOPLE BY HOUSING

02:42:54.965 --> 02:42:57.834
THOSE PEOPLE WOULD- PROVIDE A

02:42:57.901 --> 02:42:58.935
BETTER FOR THERAPEUTIC

02:42:59.002 --> 02:43:01.972
ENVIRONMENT FOR THEM. AND I

02:43:02.038 --> 02:43:04.307
THINK WE OUGHT TO LOOK AT THOSE

02:43:04.374 --> 02:43:06.176
OPTIONS THAT WE CAN CONSIDER.

02:43:06.243 --> 02:43:08.945
TO REDUCE INCARCERATION I

02:43:09.012 --> 02:43:10.514
LOOKED SPECIFICALLY AT THE RE

02:43:10.580 --> 02:43:15.819
ENTRY- BEDS. AND IN THE IN THE

02:43:15.886 --> 02:43:21.291
CHART AND I SEE WILL IS. OUR

02:43:21.358 --> 02:43:21.892
POSSIBILITY OF INCREASING THAT

02:43:21.958 --> 02:43:23.293
THAT'S A TO BE. KIND OF WHAT

02:43:23.360 --> 02:43:25.695

I LIKE TO ASK THEM. IF YOU USE

02:43:43.146 --> 02:43:45.115

02:43:45.182 --> 02:43:47.017
WOULD YOU SAY THE STATE'S MOST

02:43:47.083 --> 02:43:51.054
IMPORTANT NEXT STEPS ARE. OF

02:43:51.121 --> 02:43:54.291
FOUR OF THAT WE TAKE IN REGARDS

02:43:54.357 --> 02:43:56.326
TO. PEOPLE THAT ARE FORMALLY

02:43:56.393 --> 02:43:58.562
INCARCERATED- WHAT KIND OF

02:43:58.628 --> 02:44:01.131

02:44:02.632 --> 02:44:08.104
EFFECTIVE- AND- SUCH ABUSE

02:44:08.171 --> 02:44:09.673
TREATMENT IS A SPECIAL SPECIAL

02:44:09.739 --> 02:44:14.144
INTEREST OF MINE I VISITED THE

02:44:14.211 --> 02:44:16.346
DOMINANT FRIZZ. YOUR MATCHING

02:44:16.413 --> 02:44:17.847
DIAMOND I WITH DOWN THERE AND

02:44:17.914 --> 02:44:20.450
HAD A NICE ENJOYABLE TIME WITH

02:44:20.517 --> 02:44:22.586
THE STAFF IN THE- INMATES AND

02:44:22.652 --> 02:44:26.323

02:44:26.389 --> 02:44:28.024
PROGRAM THERE THAT WAS VERY

02:44:28.091 --> 02:44:30.360
EFFECTIVE. IT WAS VERY

02:44:30.427 --> 02:44:32.462
EFFECTIVE IN FINDING JOBS FOR

02:44:32.529 --> 02:44:34.231
PEOPLE ONCE THEY LEFT DONOVAN.

02:44:34.297 --> 02:44:36.199
AND I THINK YOU KNOW WHEN YOU

02:44:36.266 --> 02:44:38.735
WE TALKED ABOUT THE JOB

02:44:38.802 --> 02:44:41.171
PLACEMENTS IN THE TRAINING AND

02:44:41.238 --> 02:44:45.008

02:44:45.075 --> 02:44:45.575
WITH THAT AND I ALSO VISITED

02:44:45.642 --> 02:44:48.945
THE- CORRECTIONS FACILITY IN A

02:44:49.012 --> 02:44:50.480
CENTRAL CALIFORNIA FOR WOMEN.

02:44:50.547 --> 02:44:52.182
AND I FOUND THAT MAYBE THEY

02:44:52.249 --> 02:44:54.217
DON'T HAVE SUCH A ROBUST JOB

02:44:54.284 --> 02:44:58.822
TRAINING. PROGRAMS THAT MAYBE

02:44:58.888 --> 02:45:00.290
WOULD BE RELEVANT I MEAN THEY

02:45:00.357 --> 02:45:02.425
HAD SOME JOBS JOBS IN THE

02:45:02.492 --> 02:45:04.427
PRISON MAKING FLAGS AND- NO

DENTAL APERTURES AND OTHER

02:45:06.529 --> 02:45:10.967
THINGS BUT- HOW CAN WE IMPROVE

02:45:11.034 --> 02:45:13.303
THOSE PROGRAMS TO MAKE THEM

02:45:13.370 --> 02:45:15.005
RELEVANT TO PEOPLE. IN

02:45:15.071 --> 02:45:16.840
PLACEMENT OF JOBS AFTER THEY

02:45:16.906 --> 02:45:18.908

02:45:18.975 --> 02:45:21.177
QUESTIONS MAYBE PERHAPS YOU CAN

02:45:21.244 --> 02:45:24.581

02:45:24.648 --> 02:45:26.549
PRINT MY PURPOSES THIS IS THE

02:45:26.616 --> 02:45:28.351
BASE CASE WHICH IS START HERE

02:45:28.418 --> 02:45:30.487
AND WE SAID OKAY LET'S GET TO

02:45:30.553 --> 02:45:32.522

NEXT FEW MONTHS- LET'S COME UP

02:45:34.724 --> 02:45:36.393

BUDGET PROCESS I'D SAY MY

02:45:41.131 --> 02:45:41.898
COMMENTS OF THE- KIND OF BRIEF

02:45:41.965 --> 02:45:43.767
THIS SIX BECAUSE- I THINK THAT

02:45:43.833 --> 02:45:45.702
A LOT OF MYSTERIES AND I THINK

02:45:45.769 --> 02:45:48.805
THERE'S A LOT OF. A LOT OF-

02:45:48.872 --> 02:45:51.174
MISMATCH IN TERMS OF THE

02:45:51.241 --> 02:45:52.042
PROGRAMMATIC OFFERINGS IN THE

02:45:52.108 --> 02:45:53.610
INSTITUTIONS. AND WHAT PEOPLE

02:45:53.677 --> 02:45:55.912
ACTUALLY NEED AND AS YOU

02:45:55.979 --> 02:45:57.380
MENTIONED PEOPLE WHO WERE WHO

02:45:57.447 --> 02:45:58.515
WERE RETURNING FROM PRISON I

02:45:58.581 --> 02:46:00.383
THINK. ON THE FRONT END PEOPLE

02:46:00.450 --> 02:46:01.951
COME IN AND WE NEED A BETTER

02:46:02.018 --> 02:46:02.952
SENSE OF WHO THEY ARE WHAT THEY

02:46:03.019 --> 02:46:05.255
NEED. IS SO THAT WE CAN

02:46:05.322 --> 02:46:07.724
PRESCRIBE. A PROGRAM THAT WILL

02:46:07.791 --> 02:46:09.192
ACTUALLY SUPPORT THEM ADDRESS

02:46:09.259 --> 02:46:09.926
THOSE NEEDS AND WHEN THEY GO

02:46:09.993 --> 02:46:12.362
HOME. WHAT NEEDS TO REMAIN TO

02:46:12.429 --> 02:46:14.230
MAKE SURE THAT WHILE THEY'RE ON

02:46:14.297 --> 02:46:16.366
PAROLE OR AND OTHERS IN THE

02:46:16.433 --> 02:46:16.966
COMMUNITY. THAT THEY GET THE

02:46:17.033 --> 02:46:18.902
KIND OF SUPPORT. THEY NEED

02:46:18.968 --> 02:46:20.003
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO

02:46:20.070 --> 02:46:22.605
COUNSELING THERAPY I THINK ONE

02:46:22.672 --> 02:46:23.773
THING THAT CAN REALLY HELP ME

02:46:23.840 --> 02:46:24.774
AND YOU KNOW THAT'S WHAT A TO

02:46:24.841 --> 02:46:26.810
THE- THE POINT THAT YOU RAISED

02:46:26.876 --> 02:46:28.345
ABOUT. WHAT YOU SAW WHEN YOU

02:46:28.411 --> 02:46:31.681
WENT TO THE INSTITUTIONS. I

02:46:31.748 --> 02:46:34.084
THINK THAT. THAT PEOPLE IN THE

02:46:34.150 --> 02:46:34.884
LEGISLATURE NEED TO GET INTO

02:46:34.951 --> 02:46:37.387
THE PRISONS. YOU NEED TO SEE

02:46:37.454 --> 02:46:39.255
THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE THERE BY

02:46:39.322 --> 02:46:41.291
THE TWENTY SIX NOW I THINK.

02:46:41.358 --> 02:46:42.625
I'LL I'LL BET MOST PEOPLE HAVE

02:46:42.692 --> 02:46:45.128
NOT BEEN TWENTY SIX- BECAUSE

02:46:45.195 --> 02:46:46.796
BECAUSE IT'S PEOPLE DON'T QUITE

02:46:46.863 --> 02:46:47.997
UNDERSTAND WHAT LOOKS LIKE WHAT

02:46:48.064 --> 02:46:49.966
IT FEELS LIKE. OUR BE TRUE ASK

02:46:50.033 --> 02:46:52.235
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE INCARCERATED

02:46:52.302 --> 02:46:53.970
WHAT THEY NEED. IF YOU PROVIDE

02:46:54.037 --> 02:46:55.372
A SAFE SPACE THEY WILL SHARE

02:46:55.438 --> 02:46:59.309
THAT WITH YOU. AND THEN THEN

02:46:59.376 --> 02:47:01.144
HAVE THE DRIVER POLICY. INSTEAD

02:47:01.211 --> 02:47:02.746
OF CREATE A POLICY AND SAY HEY

02:47:02.812 --> 02:47:03.480
WE'RE GIVING YOU WHAT WE THINK

02:47:03.546 --> 02:47:05.014
YOU PROBABLY NEED AND I THINK

02:47:05.081 --> 02:47:06.483
THAT'S A BIG MISSING PIECE I

02:47:06.549 --> 02:47:07.150
MEAN THERE'S A LOT OF

02:47:07.217 --> 02:47:08.351
INFORMATION THAT COULD BE CAN

02:47:08.418 --> 02:47:09.886
BE GLEANED ESPECIALLY WHEN IT

02:47:09.953 --> 02:47:11.721
COMES TO PEOPLE WHO ARE

02:47:11.788 --> 02:47:12.255
SURVIVORS OF GENDER BASED

02:47:12.322 --> 02:47:14.657
VIOLENCE. THERE IS SUCH A GREAT

02:47:14.724 --> 02:47:17.961
NEED OF SPACE TO TALK ABOUT IT.

02:47:18.027 --> 02:47:19.696
ASK FOR WHAT THEY NEED THAT

02:47:19.763 --> 02:47:20.997

OUR PROGRAMMATIC DECISIONS

02:47:22.399 --> 02:47:23.800
GOING FORWARD I THINK IN THAT

02:47:23.867 --> 02:47:24.968
THAT JUST MEANS GOING TO THE

02:47:25.034 --> 02:47:26.536

AT THE YOU KNOW IT IS VERY

02:52:12.922 --> 02:52:16.826
IMPORTANT I HAD ONE OTHER

02:52:16.893 --> 02:52:18.861
QUESTION FOR OUR ROOM.

02:52:18.928 --> 02:52:25.401
SECRETARY. I EIGHT. WHEN YOU

02:52:25.468 --> 02:52:31.207
GIVE SOMEBODY A. A SENS AND

02:52:31.274 --> 02:52:32.975
THEN THEY GO TO PRISON. AND

02:52:33.042 --> 02:52:34.310
THEN THEY HAVE BEHAVIORAL

02:52:34.377 --> 02:52:38.681
PROBLES IN THE PRISON. AND

02:52:38.748 --> 02:52:41.718
THIRD PRISON TERM IS THE US

02:52:41.784 --> 02:52:43.486
BECAUSE OF INFRACTIONS IN THE

02:52:43.553 --> 02:52:47.323
SYSTEM YOU HAVE. EXTENDED IN

02:52:47.390 --> 02:52:54.197
TIME. OF I VIEW THAT IS KIND OF

02:52:54.263 --> 02:52:56.365
A FAILURE OF PROVIDING MENTAL

02:52:56.432 --> 02:52:59.302
HEALTH SERVICES. AND I VIEW IT

02:52:59.368 --> 02:53:00.837
AS SOMETHING THAT WE PROBABLY

02:53:00.903 --> 02:53:02.805
SHOULD RECONSIDER THE WAY WE DO

02:53:02.872 --> 02:53:07.076
THAT. IN TERMS OF. THERE SHOULD

02:53:07.143 --> 02:53:09.278
BE NO PUNISHMENT CRIMINALLY FOR

02:53:09.345 --> 02:53:10.646
ANYBODY THAT HAS A MENTAL

02:53:10.713 --> 02:53:19.889
HEALTH PROBLEM. IN. TO THE WHEN

02:53:19.956 --> 02:53:23.760
WE EXTENDERS SENS OR THEIR TIME

02:53:23.826 --> 02:53:27.230
OR SOMEHOW. PROVIDE SOME

02:53:27.296 --> 02:53:29.165
PUNISHMENT FOR THEM IN THEIR

02:53:29.232 --> 02:53:33.770
BEHAVIOR. OF IS THERE'S SOME

02:53:33.836 --> 02:53:35.104
CHANGES THAT YOU ARE

02:53:35.171 --> 02:53:37.240
CONSIDERING AND THEN I HAD A

02:53:37.306 --> 02:53:41.110
QUESTION ABOUT GANG AFFILIATION.

02:53:41.177 --> 02:53:45.615
OF AND LABELING PEOPLE RELATIVE

02:53:45.681 --> 02:53:47.083
TO GANGS AND EXTENSION OF THEIR

02:53:47.150 --> 02:53:51.454
SENTENCING. IS THAT A- WHAT ARE

02:53:51.521 --> 02:53:52.054
THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT ARE

02:53:52.121 --> 02:53:54.924
DONE TERMS OF EXTENDING THE

02:53:54.991 --> 02:53:58.728
SENSES AND IS IT. TIME TO

02:53:58.795 --> 02:54:00.997
REALLY CONSIDER SOME OF THOSE

02:54:01.063 --> 02:54:05.368
THINGS. I THINK IF. IT'S TIME

02:54:05.434 --> 02:54:06.936
THAT WE RECONSIDER MANY THINGS

02:54:07.003 --> 02:54:10.006
SENATOR- IN RELATION TO THE

02:54:10.072 --> 02:54:11.174
ADDITIONAL TIME THAT YOU'RE

02:54:11.240 --> 02:54:13.176
REFERRING TO I'M ONLY THINKING

02:54:13.242 --> 02:54:16.112
OF INMATES WHO RECEIVED- GOOD

02:54:16.179 --> 02:54:18.247
CONDUCT CREDITS THAT APPLIED TO

02:54:18.314 --> 02:54:19.515
THEIR CURRENT SENTENCE THAT

02:54:19.582 --> 02:54:21.217
THERE'S ALREADY BUILT IN CREDIT

02:54:21.284 --> 02:54:23.452
CREDITS BUT READ IT IS DEMERITS

02:54:23.519 --> 02:54:24.353
IF THEY GET DEMERITS SO THEY

02:54:24.420 --> 02:54:25.922
LOSE THE CONDUCT CREDITS THAT

02:54:25.988 --> 02:54:27.123
THEY'VE EARNED BY EITHER THE

02:54:27.190 --> 02:54:28.858
TYPE A SENTENCE THEY RECEIVED

02:54:28.925 --> 02:54:30.726
OR- TIME OFF SENTENCES BY

02:54:30.793 --> 02:54:32.261
PARTICIPATION IN PROGRAMMER

02:54:32.328 --> 02:54:34.597
OTHER OTHERWISE- THE MENTAL

02:54:34.664 --> 02:54:37.233
HEALTH POPULATION- AS STATED

02:54:37.300 --> 02:54:39.068
EARLIER TO HAS RISEN WE HAVE TO

02:54:39.135 --> 02:54:40.837
RECOGNIZE THAT. WE DO HAVE TO

02:54:40.903 --> 02:54:41.971
TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE

02:54:42.038 --> 02:54:43.105
MENTAL HEALTH BEHAVIOR BEFORE

02:54:43.172 --> 02:54:45.241
WE DO BEFORE WE ADDRESS ANY

02:54:45.308 --> 02:54:47.376
LOSS OF CREDITS WE CAN DO

02:54:47.443 --> 02:54:49.745
BETTER AT FACT- WILL NOT ONLY

02:54:49.812 --> 02:54:50.947
BECAUSE OF THE COMMON CORD IS

02:54:51.013 --> 02:54:52.148
ASKING US TO BUT I THINK

02:54:52.215 --> 02:54:53.716
INTERNALLY WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE

02:54:53.783 --> 02:54:55.818
THE SOME OF THE BEHAVIORS THAT

02:54:55.885 --> 02:54:58.087
INMATES EXHIBIT OUR MENTAL

02:54:58.154 --> 02:55:00.256
HEALTH RELATED AND SHOULD THEY

02:55:00.323 --> 02:55:02.491
RECEIVE TIME OFF SENTENCE FOR

02:55:02.558 --> 02:55:04.994
THAT- IF WE CAN ATTRIBUTE TO

02:55:05.061 --> 02:55:07.129
THE MENTAL HEALTH. I THINK YOU

02:55:07.196 --> 02:55:08.931
KNOW BALANCING SAFETY SECURITY

02:55:08.998 --> 02:55:11.167
AND SUPPORTING STAFF NEEDS OUR

02:55:11.234 --> 02:55:12.902
CONCERNS AND HOW WE TRACK IN

02:55:12.969 --> 02:55:14.437
AND DEAL WITH AN INDIVIDUAL

02:55:14.503 --> 02:55:17.173
EITHER BY GETTING OF THE MENTAL

02:55:17.240 --> 02:55:18.574
HEALTH SERVICES THEY NEED. FOR

02:55:18.641 --> 02:55:20.509
PROVIDING. A SAFER LEVEL OF

02:55:20.576 --> 02:55:21.911
HOUSING FOR THEM BASED ON THE

02:55:21.978 --> 02:55:23.913
SECURITY IT'S A DIFFICULT. YOU

02:55:23.980 --> 02:55:26.115
KNOW IT'S A DIFFICULT- POSITION

02:55:26.182 --> 02:55:27.250
TO BE IN TO TRY AND MATCH THE

02:55:27.316 --> 02:55:29.252
BOLD BUT I KNOW. ONE THING THAT

02:55:29.318 --> 02:55:30.820
WE ARE LOOKING AT IS YOU KNOW

02:55:30.887 --> 02:55:33.122
DO WE WRITE DISCIPLINARY IS FOR

02:55:33.189 --> 02:55:34.357
PEOPLE TO TAKE SOME TIME OFF

02:55:34.423 --> 02:55:36.259
THEIR SENTENCE JUST BECAUSE-

02:55:36.325 --> 02:55:37.727
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY DID HAS A

02:55:37.793 --> 02:55:39.395
MENTAL HEALTH COMPONENT TO IT.

02:55:39.462 --> 02:55:40.129
I THINK GRANT A POINT ON

02:55:40.196 --> 02:55:41.497
CORRECTIONS WE CAN START MAKING

02:55:41.564 --> 02:55:43.299
BETTER INFORMED DECISIONS. BUT

02:55:43.366 --> 02:55:44.467
WE DO HAVE TO DOCUMENT THE

02:55:44.533 --> 02:55:46.002
BEHAVIOR FOR TREATMENT PURPOSES

02:55:46.068 --> 02:55:48.471
SO WE CAN SHOW EITHER FOR PRE

02:55:48.537 --> 02:55:51.274
PAROLE OR PROGRAM NEEDS. IT HAS

02:55:51.340 --> 02:55:54.043
TO BE DOCUMENTED SOMEWHERE- IN

02:55:54.110 --> 02:55:57.480
RELATION TO- FOR WE HOUSE

02:55:57.546 --> 02:55:59.081
INMATES THAT'S ANOTHER THING

02:55:59.148 --> 02:56:00.383
THAT WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT

02:56:00.449 --> 02:56:02.118
WE HAVE BEEN MATES DEBTORS-

02:56:02.184 --> 02:56:03.586
MENTALLY ILL. THE RAIN

02:56:03.653 --> 02:56:05.755
RESTRICTED HOUSINGS OUR ADS SAY

02:56:05.821 --> 02:56:07.556
EGGS ARE SOLITARY CONFINEMENT

02:56:07.623 --> 02:56:08.991
WHATEVER YOU KNOW. WHATEVER

02:56:09.058 --> 02:56:10.426
TURN PEOPLE ON TO USE THESE

02:56:10.493 --> 02:56:12.361
DAYS BUT WE RECOGNIZE THAT. A

02:56:12.428 --> 02:56:14.196
LOT OF MENTAL HEALTH DOES DRIVE

02:56:14.263 --> 02:56:16.232
A PERSON'S PLACEMENT IN THOSE

02:56:16.299 --> 02:56:16.832
AREAS. AND THEN THEY LIKE TO

02:56:16.899 --> 02:56:18.534
STAY THERE FOR VARIOUS REASONS

02:56:18.601 --> 02:56:21.404
EITHER OUT OF FEAR. FOR THEIR

02:56:21.470 --> 02:56:23.306
TO THEY HAVE- DECOMPENSATED TO

02:56:23.372 --> 02:56:24.640
A POINT THAT'S ALL THE WORLD

02:56:24.707 --> 02:56:25.675
THAT THEY KNOW AND THAT'S A

02:56:25.741 --> 02:56:26.776
STRUGGLE THAT WE HAVE RIGHT

02:56:26.842 --> 02:56:29.445
NOW. WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO SAY.

02:56:29.512 --> 02:56:31.047
A PERSON'S BEHAVIOR SHOULDN'T

02:56:31.113 --> 02:56:32.648
AUTOMATICALLY PLACE THEM IN A

02:56:32.715 --> 02:56:34.317
SEGREGATED HOUSING MAY THEY

02:56:34.383 --> 02:56:35.418
JUST SEEM TO BE IN ANOTHER TYPE

02:56:35.484 --> 02:56:37.386
OF HOUSING IN A- IN A-

02:56:37.453 --> 02:56:39.121
COMMUNITY SETTING OR AN AREA TO

02:56:39.188 --> 02:56:41.357
WERE STAFF FOR. OR CLINICAL

02:56:41.424 --> 02:56:43.993
STAFF CAN A JESTER NEEDS BETTER

02:56:44.060 --> 02:56:47.930
THAN AN AD SIX SETTING. SO WE

02:56:47.997 --> 02:56:48.898
TALKED ABOUT TWO DIFFERENT

02:56:48.965 --> 02:56:50.366
THINGS THE TIME OFFICE SENTENCE

02:56:50.433 --> 02:56:52.468
BASIN BEHAVIOR. THAT'S MINUS

02:56:52.535 --> 02:56:54.870
THEM GETTING. ALSO ADDING OF

02:56:54.937 --> 02:56:57.006
TIME OR ADDING OF TIME WOULD BE

02:56:57.073 --> 02:56:58.407
THEY GO OUT AND GET ANOTHER

02:56:58.474 --> 02:57:00.242
CHARGE IN THE- WORK OF THE

02:57:00.309 --> 02:57:06.882
COMMITTEE ELEMENT COUNTY TODAY.

02:57:06.949 --> 02:57:09.318
WELL IN THAT CASE THE TICKET.

02:57:09.385 --> 02:57:10.353
THEY LOOKED ALL FACT AND THEY

02:57:10.419 --> 02:57:10.920
HAVE TO MAKE THEIR OWN. WHEN

02:57:10.987 --> 02:57:11.754
THEY WERE TO CHARGE NOT. I

02:57:11.821 --> 02:57:12.388
THINK WHAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO

02:57:12.455 --> 02:57:13.055
IS EXTEND THEIR SENT BASED TIME

02:57:13.122 --> 02:57:16.325
EARNED. THIS CASE WE HAVE TO-

02:57:16.392 --> 02:57:18.227
AND PLAINTIFFS COUNSEL ON THE

02:57:18.294 --> 02:57:20.396
ON THE COLEMAN CASE THAT'S AN

02:57:20.463 --> 02:57:20.997
ISSUE THAT THEY HAVE WITH US

02:57:21.063 --> 02:57:22.765
AND WE ARE. WE DON'T HAVE OUR

02:57:22.832 --> 02:57:24.633
HE'LL SO DUG IN BUT IT'S ABOUT

02:57:24.700 --> 02:57:26.168
MATCHING. GIVEN THE RIGHT

02:57:26.235 --> 02:57:27.970
ANSWER SO WE CAN MAINTAIN

02:57:28.037 --> 02:57:29.105
SAFETY SECURITY BUT THE SAME

02:57:29.171 --> 02:57:31.440
TIME. ADDRESSING THE SAFETY

02:57:31.507 --> 02:57:33.376
CONCERNS THAT AN INMATE HAS. SO

02:57:33.442 --> 02:57:35.378
WHAT ON THE RE ENTRY PIECE

02:57:35.444 --> 02:57:37.813
WHAT. WHAT WE HAVE NOW LONG. I

02:57:37.880 --> 02:57:38.814
THINK WE'VE ALWAYS NANA BUT

02:57:38.881 --> 02:57:40.216
JUST FOR A TO SAY IT RANCHERIA

02:57:40.282 --> 02:57:43.052
BEGINS DAY ONE. FOR AN INMATE.

02:57:43.119 --> 02:57:44.186
DAY ONE THAT THEY HAD A

02:57:44.253 --> 02:57:46.322
RECEPTION CENTER. AND THEN THE

02:57:46.389 --> 02:57:48.124
DAY ZERO BEFORE THEY GO OUT RE

02:57:48.190 --> 02:57:50.159
AND WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT

02:57:50.226 --> 02:57:52.328
WE HAVE. FIRST IDENTIFY THE

02:57:52.395 --> 02:57:54.864
INDIVIDUAL'S NEEDS TO MISTER

02:57:54.930 --> 02:57:58.801
WALLACE POINT- JUST. AN INMATE

02:57:58.868 --> 02:57:59.402
IN A VERY PROGRAM JUST AS AN

02:57:59.468 --> 02:58:00.236
OPENING DOESN'T MEAN THAT'S

02:58:00.302 --> 02:58:01.303
BEST PRO FOR THEM IS PROBABLY A

02:58:01.370 --> 02:58:03.506
WASTE OF RESOURCE. SO WE HAVE

02:58:03.572 --> 02:58:04.707
TO ASSESS WHAT THE INDIVIDUAL'S

02:58:04.774 --> 02:58:05.941
NEEDS ARE WE HAVE TO ASSESS

02:58:06.008 --> 02:58:07.676
WHAT THE RISK IS. AND THAT HAS

02:58:07.743 --> 02:58:10.012
TO BE A STATIC ASSESSMENT IT I

02:58:10.079 --> 02:58:11.514
MEAN MORE DYNAMIC RIGHT NOW

02:58:11.580 --> 02:58:13.549
WITH STATIC. WE CAN DO IT. A

02:58:13.616 --> 02:58:15.051
NEAR ONE BUT THAT WE MAY NOT

02:58:15.117 --> 02:58:16.919
RECESS UNTIL YOUR FIVE A LOT OF

02:58:16.986 --> 02:58:17.787
HAPPENED IN THE FIVE YEARS

02:58:17.853 --> 02:58:18.821
THEY'VE MATURED THEY'VE

02:58:18.888 --> 02:58:20.322
LEARNED. AND GROWN SO THEIR

02:58:20.389 --> 02:58:22.224
NEEDS. ARE ALSO GOING TO

02:58:22.291 --> 02:58:23.859
INCREASE OF THE WE NEED TO BE

02:58:23.926 --> 02:58:24.760
MORE DYNAMIC ON WHAT WE HOUSE

02:58:24.827 --> 02:58:27.196
THEM- TO INCLUDE LOWER LEVEL

02:58:27.263 --> 02:58:29.365
HOUSING. INDIVIDUAL DON'T

02:58:29.432 --> 02:58:30.166
ALWAYS NEED TO BE A LEVEL FOUR

02:58:30.232 --> 02:58:31.567
FACILITIES WHICH ARE HIGHEST

02:58:31.634 --> 02:58:33.602
LEVEL THEY DON'T- AND I THINK

02:58:33.669 --> 02:58:34.970
THE YOUTHFUL OFFENDER PROGRAM

02:58:35.037 --> 02:58:36.439
THAT'S BEING PROPOSED IN THE

02:58:36.505 --> 02:58:37.807
BUDGET IS ADDRESSING THAT

02:58:37.873 --> 02:58:39.275
ISSUE. RECOGNIZING THAT INMATES

02:58:39.341 --> 02:58:40.943
WHO HAVE BACKED UP MANY POINTS

02:58:41.010 --> 02:58:41.911
THE FIRST FEW YEARS OF

02:58:41.977 --> 02:58:43.979
INCARCERATION. THAT MAY NOT BE

02:58:44.046 --> 02:58:45.915
THE BEST PLACE FOR THEM IN YOUR

02:58:45.981 --> 02:58:48.384
FIVERR YOUR TEN. BECAUSE THEY

02:58:48.451 --> 02:58:49.285
HAVE LEARNED THAT WAS NOT A

02:58:49.351 --> 02:58:50.953
PROPER WAY THINKING. WE HAVE

02:58:51.020 --> 02:58:52.788
OVER WRITTEN DOWN INMATES IF

02:58:52.855 --> 02:58:54.023
THEY HAVE BEEN DESPAIR FREEZE

02:58:54.090 --> 02:58:55.191
WE CAN GET THEM THE NEEDS THAT

02:58:55.257 --> 02:58:57.893
THEY YOUR PAROLE- DEPARTMENTS

02:58:57.960 --> 02:59:00.963
FEEL THAT THERE IS A LACK OF.

02:59:01.030 --> 02:59:04.033
THE FOR PEOPLE TO LIVE IN YES.

02:59:04.100 --> 02:59:06.168
HOW CAN WE COORDINATE THAT.

02:59:06.235 --> 02:59:08.504

IN LINE WITH THE HOUSING PIECE

02:59:16.045 --> 02:59:17.246
I THINK RE ENTRY SERVICES

02:59:17.313 --> 02:59:18.914
RAINTREE HOUSING NOT TO FOR THE

02:59:18.981 --> 02:59:20.182
SAKE OF HOUSING BUT WRAPAROUND

03:04:32.694 --> 03:04:38.367
LIFE BUT IT'S THEY'RE THE SAME.

03:04:38.434 --> 03:04:40.502
YEAH I IT'S DO WITH THAT IS

03:04:40.569 --> 03:04:41.870
THAT A MAJOR. IT IS A PER. IN

03:04:41.937 --> 03:04:43.705
IT NEEDS BE A- I THINK PEOPLE

03:04:43.772 --> 03:04:44.306
ARE IN THE JUVENILE JUSTICE.

03:04:44.373 --> 03:04:44.873
AND I THINK EVERYBODY WOULD

03:04:44.940 --> 03:04:46.141
AGREE IS THAT WE NEED MORE

03:04:46.208 --> 03:04:47.376
RESOURCES FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE

03:04:47.443 --> 03:04:48.844
COMING HOME ESPECIALLY FROM

03:04:48.911 --> 03:04:50.546
INCARCERATION IT'S HARD ENOUGH

03:04:50.612 --> 03:04:51.647
FOR INDIVIDUALS TRANSITION AND

03:04:51.713 --> 03:04:53.449
OF THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM.

03:04:53.515 --> 03:04:55.017
WITHOUT THE OTHER ADDITIONAL

03:04:55.083 --> 03:04:56.318
ISSUES OF COMING OUT OF A

03:04:56.385 --> 03:04:58.654
CORRECTIONAL SYSTEM- SO TO TAKE

03:04:58.720 --> 03:05:00.322
THAT RESOURCE AWAY FROM THEM IS

03:05:00.389 --> 03:05:01.423
ONLY GOING TO PUT THAT IN A

03:05:01.490 --> 03:05:02.458
SITUATION WHERE THEY WILL

03:05:02.524 --> 03:05:03.759
LIKELY END UP IN THE ADULT

03:05:03.826 --> 03:05:05.828
SYSTEM MORE HAVE A HIGHER RISK.

03:05:05.894 --> 03:05:06.995
TO END UP IN THE ADULT SYSTEM

03:05:07.062 --> 03:05:08.697
AND THEN COME TO US TWENTY

03:05:08.764 --> 03:05:10.833
YEARS SAID LATER FOR HELP. SO I

03:05:10.899 --> 03:05:11.867
THINK THAT DOES NEED TO BE

03:05:11.934 --> 03:05:14.036
ADDRESSED I THINK IS A SOMEBODY

03:05:14.102 --> 03:05:15.137
THAT'S EXPERIENCE THAT I CAN

03:05:15.204 --> 03:05:16.939
SAY THAT. AND SOMEBODY IT'S NOW

03:05:17.005 --> 03:05:18.507
APPARENT YOU KNOW MY DAUGHTER I

03:05:18.574 --> 03:05:19.741
ADOPTED MY DAUGHTER AT FIVE

03:05:19.808 --> 03:05:22.010
YEARS OLD SHE'S FIFTEEN. AND

03:05:22.077 --> 03:05:23.245
I'M VERY PROUD TO BE ABLE TO

03:05:23.312 --> 03:05:24.713
GET THOSE RESOURCES BUT I KNOW

03:05:24.780 --> 03:05:27.149
WHAT IT'S LIKE THE I LIVED ON

03:05:27.216 --> 03:05:28.617
MY OWN I WAS FIFTEEN. IN A

03:05:28.684 --> 03:05:31.854
YEARS OLD. I KNOW THE CHECK.

03:05:31.920 --> 03:05:32.654

03:05:32.721 --> 03:05:33.522
FIFTEEN YEAR. LIVING ON MY OWN

03:05:33.589 --> 03:05:35.290
THAN STRUCK. WORKING TWO JOBS

03:05:35.357 --> 03:05:37.025
AND TRYING TO GO TO SCHOOL. AND

03:05:37.092 --> 03:05:38.961
TRYING TO GET BY AND NOT REALLY

LIVED IN- OR- MADE AWARE OF TO

03:05:45.734 --> 03:05:49.104
MEANS AT THAT TIME SO. YES I. I

03:05:49.171 --> 03:05:50.305
THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT DOES

03:05:50.372 --> 03:05:51.306
NEED TO BE ADDRESSED AT THINK

03:05:51.373 --> 03:05:53.141

03:05:59.114 --> 03:06:01.016
BARRIERS FOR THEM AS WELL TO

BECAUSE THEY'RE HELPING TO

03:06:01.650 --> 03:06:02.618
COORDINATE GETTING THEM OUTOF

03:06:02.684 --> 03:06:05.854
THE SYSTEMS OF RESOURCES. AND

03:06:05.921 --> 03:06:07.122

ABOUT THAT AT THE DEPARTMENT OF

03:06:10.259 --> 03:06:12.995
CORRECTIONS SO. FINDS OUT IF

REAL NO BRAINER FOR US TO DO

03:07:06.448 --> 03:07:08.650

GREATLY BADLY NEEDED OF LOCAL-

03:11:31.680 --> 03:11:34.516
SUPPORT- COUNTY CITY BASE.

03:11:34.583 --> 03:11:38.186
IMPORT OF FOR SURE- AND PART OF

03:11:38.253 --> 03:11:40.222
THAT IS ABOUT. I WAS THE

03:11:40.288 --> 03:11:41.590
FINANCIALS OF ISN'T BUT ALSO

03:11:41.656 --> 03:11:43.024
JUST IN ACCESS TO THE

03:11:43.091 --> 03:11:45.126
INSTITUTIONS INTO THE PEOPLE WE

03:11:45.193 --> 03:11:47.062
WORKING WITH- A AND I THINK I

03:11:47.128 --> 03:11:48.363
WILL SAY YOU KNOW THE LAST

03:11:48.430 --> 03:11:49.130
COUPLE YEARS THINGS GOT A LOT

03:11:49.197 --> 03:11:51.533
BETTER- AND THOSE ARE GOOD

03:11:51.600 --> 03:11:54.636
IDEAS IS. COMMITTED TO CONTINUE

03:11:54.703 --> 03:11:56.238
TO PARTNER WITH THE COMMUNITY

03:11:56.304 --> 03:11:57.372
BASED ORGANIZATIONS BECAUSE HE

03:11:57.439 --> 03:12:02.310
RECOGNIZES THE VALUE THAT FOLKS

03:12:02.377 --> 03:12:02.944
BRING WHEN THEY WHEN THEY COME

03:12:03.011 --> 03:12:05.981
TO THE INSTITUTIONS. HOWEVER

03:12:06.047 --> 03:12:08.383
MANY OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE

03:12:08.450 --> 03:12:09.684
COMING IN AS A PART OF A

03:12:09.751 --> 03:12:11.119
COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATION

03:12:11.186 --> 03:12:13.121
ARE COMING AS VOLUNTEERS.

03:12:13.188 --> 03:12:14.522
THEY'RE DOING IT ON EVENINGS

03:12:14.589 --> 03:12:17.058
WEEKENDS- AND NONE OF US CAN

03:12:17.125 --> 03:12:19.027
SUPPORT OURSELVES OUR FAMILIES

03:12:19.094 --> 03:12:20.662
AS WELL AS VOLUNTEERS SO WE

03:12:20.729 --> 03:12:23.298
NEED A MUCH MUCH BROADER BASE

03:12:23.365 --> 03:12:24.266
OF FUNDING TO SUPPORT THOSE%

03:12:24.332 --> 03:12:26.368
EFFORTS. AND I GUESS AS A

03:12:26.434 --> 03:12:29.104
FOOTNOTE TO THAT- ALL SERVICES

03:12:29.170 --> 03:12:31.373
ARE NOT EQUAL SO THERE MAY BE

03:12:31.439 --> 03:12:33.108
REALLY GOOD SERVICES AND IN

03:12:33.174 --> 03:12:34.643
CERTAIN COMMUNITIES I REPRESENT

03:12:34.709 --> 03:12:36.544
RURAL AGRICULTURAL DISTRICT.

03:12:36.611 --> 03:12:41.716
AND IT'S BIG AND MANY OF THE

03:12:41.783 --> 03:12:43.218
INMATES AT A RETURNING TO

03:12:43.285 --> 03:12:46.721
THEIR- COUNTIES ARE LIVING AN

03:12:46.788 --> 03:12:48.556
ISOLATED COMMUNITY SO THAT THIS

03:12:48.623 --> 03:12:52.127
SUPPORT AND THE- THE ABILITY TO

03:12:52.193 --> 03:12:54.162
BE ABLE TO TAKE TO PARTICIPATE

03:12:54.229 --> 03:12:55.130
IN A PROGRAM MAY BE LIMITED AND

03:12:55.196 --> 03:12:57.232
SO THEM. I JUST THINK WE NEED

03:12:57.299 --> 03:12:57.999
TO THINK A LITTLE BIT MORE

03:12:58.066 --> 03:12:59.868
ABOUT HOW WE MAKE SURE THAT

03:12:59.935 --> 03:13:01.603
IT'S NOT JUST LOS ANGELES FOR

03:13:01.670 --> 03:13:03.571
EXAMPLE THAT HAS A REAL GOOD

03:13:03.638 --> 03:13:04.773
SUPPORT SERVICE PROGRAM BUT

03:13:04.839 --> 03:13:06.741
THAT THAT THE ON. SOME OF THE

03:13:06.808 --> 03:13:08.276
OTHER COUNTIES HAVE HAVE THAT

03:13:08.343 --> 03:13:09.744
AS WELL I'M AND I KNOW THAT'S

03:13:09.811 --> 03:13:11.346
NOT AN ISSUE THAT. I'M NOT

03:13:11.413 --> 03:13:12.781
ASKING YOU TO SOLVE THAT ISSUE

03:13:12.847 --> 03:13:15.884
BUT I'M I'M CONCERNED ABOUT IT

03:13:15.951 --> 03:13:17.719
BECAUSE I THINK THE YOUR

03:13:17.786 --> 03:13:19.721
COMMENTS TODAY. ARE OUR- AS

03:13:19.788 --> 03:13:22.424
WHAT I HAVE SEEN. WHICH IS THAT

03:13:22.490 --> 03:13:24.659
IT IT YOU KNOW TO HAND- IN

03:13:24.726 --> 03:13:26.094
INDIVIDUAL TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS

03:13:26.161 --> 03:13:27.796
AND A ONE WAY TICKET. JUST

03:13:27.862 --> 03:13:29.431
DOESN'T GET THEM STARTED ON AND

03:13:29.497 --> 03:13:31.499
ON THE LIFE THAT ON THAT'S

03:13:31.566 --> 03:13:35.003
GOING TO BE. REALLY SUPPORTED

03:13:35.070 --> 03:13:36.571
AND THE KIDS IN THE BEST CHANCE

03:13:36.638 --> 03:13:37.772
FOR SUCCESS SO WHAT WE WANT TO

03:13:37.839 --> 03:13:39.174
BE ABLE TO DO IS TO FIGURE OUT

03:13:39.240 --> 03:13:40.542
WHAT THE SERVICES ARE THAT.

03:13:40.608 --> 03:13:42.677
THAT YOU NEED TO WRAP AROUND

03:13:42.744 --> 03:13:43.845
HOW DO WE SUPPORT THAT

03:13:43.912 --> 03:13:45.981
FINANCIALLY. UP BECAUSE IN THE

03:13:46.047 --> 03:13:47.182
END BUT WE WANT TO DO IS REDUCE

03:13:47.248 --> 03:13:48.917
OUR OWN COSTS AS WELL AS WELL

03:13:48.984 --> 03:13:51.052
AS INTEGRATE. INDIVIDUALS BACK

03:13:51.119 --> 03:13:53.555
INTO THE COMMUNITY- SO THE

03:13:53.621 --> 03:13:55.256
OTHER THING SO THAT SO THANK

YOUR COMMENTS AND- I'M SURE

03:13:58.393 --> 03:14:00.795
THAT- THE PUBLIC SAFETY

03:14:00.862 --> 03:14:01.796
COMMITTEE WILL HAVE SOME

03:14:01.863 --> 03:14:03.865
DISCUSSIONS ABOUT HOW WE CAN.

03:14:03.932 --> 03:14:05.800
WE CAN EXPAND THOSE SERVICES.

03:14:05.867 --> 03:14:10.705
IN REGARDS TO THE TESTIMONY

03:14:10.772 --> 03:14:16.277
ABOUT. REDUCING THE CONTRACTS.

03:14:16.344 --> 03:14:18.847
ED THE CONTRACTED BEDS AND THE

03:14:18.913 --> 03:14:20.648
THIS AND PARTICULAR WHAT I'M

03:14:20.715 --> 03:14:24.019
WHAT I'M REFERRING TO IS THE

03:14:24.085 --> 03:14:26.988
NUMBER OF BEDS THAT WERE IN A

03:14:27.055 --> 03:14:28.023
FIVE I HAVE IT ON A PIECE A

03:14:28.089 --> 03:14:29.924
NAPKIN SO HIT IT'S NOT AS

03:14:29.991 --> 03:14:31.326
THOROUGH AS I'D LIKE IT TO BE.

03:14:31.393 --> 03:14:32.727
IN MARCH WE'RE GOING TO REDUCE

03:14:32.794 --> 03:14:35.196
THE NUMBER OF BEDS THAT WERE

03:14:35.263 --> 03:14:37.499
PAYING FOR IN IN THE PRIVATE TO

03:14:37.565 --> 03:14:38.767
THE PRIVATE CONTRACTOR IN APRIL

03:14:38.833 --> 03:14:40.368
THAT THAT'S ANOTHER RATCHET

03:14:40.435 --> 03:14:43.371
DOWN AND MY QUESTION- BECAUSE I

03:14:43.438 --> 03:14:45.974
WAS AROUND. UNFORTUNATELY WHEN

03:14:46.041 --> 03:14:47.208
WE WERE CONTRACTING OUT OF

03:14:47.275 --> 03:14:50.045
STATE AND THOSE CONTRACTS WERE

03:14:50.111 --> 03:14:51.613
FAIRLY ONEROUS BECAUSE IT

03:14:51.679 --> 03:14:53.448
REQUIRED US TO SEND A MINIMUM

03:14:53.515 --> 03:14:56.051
NUMBER OF INMATES OUT OF STATE

03:14:56.117 --> 03:14:58.820
INTO A- CONTRACTED FACILITY AND

03:14:58.887 --> 03:15:01.423
WE NEVER MET OUR TARGETS. SO AS

03:15:01.489 --> 03:15:03.391
A CONSEQUENCE WE WERE PAYING

03:15:03.458 --> 03:15:05.393
FOR BEDS THAT WE NEVER FIELD.

03:15:05.460 --> 03:15:08.430
AND SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE AS

03:15:08.496 --> 03:15:11.132
WE LOOK AT THIS. OPPORTUNITY TO

03:15:11.199 --> 03:15:12.567
GET RID OF THOSE BEDS THAT

03:15:12.634 --> 03:15:14.402
WE'RE STILL NOT PAYING FROM

03:15:14.469 --> 03:15:15.103
EVEN IF FOR TOUCH UTILIZING

03:15:15.170 --> 03:15:18.807
THEM- CERTAINLY- CENTER THE WAY

03:15:18.873 --> 03:15:20.775
THE CONTRACTS ARE STRUCTURED WE

03:15:20.842 --> 03:15:21.509
ONLY PAY FOR THE BAD THAT WE

03:15:21.576 --> 03:15:23.611
USE. SO WE WOULD NOT BE AND

03:15:23.678 --> 03:15:25.146
THAT SORT OF SITUATION IN THIS

03:15:25.213 --> 03:15:27.015
CASE OKAY SO WHAT AS WE

03:15:27.082 --> 03:15:28.016
ELIMINATE THOSE BEDS WERE

03:15:28.083 --> 03:15:29.551
MOVING THEM BACK INTO OUR OWN

03:15:29.617 --> 03:15:30.718
FACILITIES AND NOTES AND THAT

03:15:30.785 --> 03:15:32.620
KIND THOSE CONTRACTS TERMINATE

03:15:32.687 --> 03:15:34.022
AND WE DON'T WE'RE NOT PAYING

03:15:34.089 --> 03:15:35.657

BEEN TOUCHED ON A LITTLE BACK.

03:17:35.877 --> 03:17:38.613
BUT IS REALLY GOING BACK TO THE

03:17:38.680 --> 03:17:40.715
RESEARCH SO WITH SOME

03:17:40.782 --> 03:17:42.517
INDIVIDUALS TODAY HAVE ASKED

03:17:42.584 --> 03:17:44.185

HOW DO WE ENSURE PUBLIC SAFETY

03:17:47.755 --> 03:17:49.424
FOR OUR TAX PELA. MANY MANY

03:17:49.490 --> 03:17:51.125
YEARS AGO THE NATIONAL

INSTITUTE OF CORRECTIONS AND

THE CRIME AND JUSTICE

03:17:54.195 --> 03:17:56.664
INSTITUTE. TOOK ALL OF THE

03:17:56.731 --> 03:17:59.467
RESEARCH AROUND WHAT WORKS IN

03:17:59.534 --> 03:18:01.669
REDUCING RECIDIVISM WHAT CAN WE

CRIMINAL THINKER. AND THEY TOOK

03:18:06.741 --> 03:18:09.711
THAT RESEARCH META ANALYSIS AND

03:18:09.777 --> 03:18:11.879
TURNED IT INTO A FRAMEWORK THAT

03:18:11.946 --> 03:18:13.915
PROVIDERS LECTURE REENTRY AND

03:18:13.982 --> 03:18:16.751
OTHERS CAN PUT INTO PRACTICE.

03:18:16.818 --> 03:18:19.387
THIS FRAMEWORK IS KNOWN AS THE

03:18:19.454 --> 03:18:21.055
EIGHT PRINCIPLES OF EFFECTIVE

03:18:21.122 --> 03:18:23.858
INTERVENTION AND I REALLY WANT

03:18:23.925 --> 03:18:25.893
TO BRING THAT BACK TO THE TABLE

03:18:25.960 --> 03:18:27.228
BECAUSE UTILIZING THOSE

03:18:27.295 --> 03:18:28.863
INTERVENTION FOR THE POPULATION

03:18:28.930 --> 03:18:30.698
WERE DISCUSSING. THE

03:18:30.765 --> 03:18:32.934
RESPONSIBLE AND ETHICAL THING

03:18:33.001 --> 03:18:35.003
TO DO I'VE BEEN VERY PROUD TO

03:18:35.069 --> 03:18:37.438
BE ABLE TO SAYS. THAT AT G. A

03:18:37.505 --> 03:18:39.641
REENTRY WE ARE OPERATIONALIZE

03:18:39.707 --> 03:18:41.943
AND THERE'S PRINCIPLES EVERY

03:18:42.010 --> 03:18:47.782
pEARLIER A HOW OF PRO. AND

03:18:47.849 --> 03:18:50.852
EXPERTS IN OUR FIELD THE- THREE

03:18:50.918 --> 03:18:52.453
WAYS TO MEASURE PROGRAM

03:18:52.520 --> 03:18:54.455
EFFECTIVENESS THE FIRST ONE

03:18:54.522 --> 03:18:56.324
BILLION RECIDIVISM REDUCTION

03:18:56.391 --> 03:18:58.993
WHICH HAS BEEN MENTIONED TODAY

03:18:59.060 --> 03:19:00.561
OF COURSE IT HAS ITS PROS AND

03:19:00.628 --> 03:19:03.298
IT'S CONS WE OFTEN HAVE TO MAKE

03:19:03.364 --> 03:19:04.732
SURE WE'RE MEASURING APPLES TO

03:19:04.799 --> 03:19:07.135
APPLES HERE. BUT AGAIN IF THAT

03:19:07.201 --> 03:19:08.069
CONTINUES TO BE THE GOLD

03:19:08.136 --> 03:19:09.904
STANDARD SO REDUCTIONS IN

03:19:09.971 --> 03:19:12.106
RECIDIVISM NUMBER TWO WHICH

03:19:12.173 --> 03:19:13.207
HASN'T REALLY BEEN MENTIONED

03:19:13.274 --> 03:19:15.677
TODAY IS INTERMEDIATE OUTCOMES

03:19:15.743 --> 03:19:18.279
SO THINGS SUCH AS REDUCTIONS IN

03:19:18.346 --> 03:19:20.548
CRIMINAL THINKING REDUCTIONS

RESPONSIBLE BUDGET CORRECT- I

03:21:13.561 --> 03:21:16.364
WANTED TO TOUCH ON A FEW THINGS

03:21:16.431 --> 03:21:17.632
OVER THE COURSE OF THE HEARING.

03:21:17.698 --> 03:21:18.533
ANOTHER THINGS WAS THERE'S FEAR

03:21:18.599 --> 03:21:21.936
OF LETTING PEOPLE OUT EARLY.

03:21:22.003 --> 03:21:23.971
PROVIDING OVERCROWDING WHAT

MITIGATE THAT IS TO RELEASE

03:21:27.775 --> 03:21:30.077
PEOPLE FROM INCARCERATION-

03:21:30.144 --> 03:21:31.446
THERE HAS NOT BEEN THERE'S A

03:21:31.512 --> 03:21:33.347
LOT OF STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT.

03:21:33.414 --> 03:21:34.215
PEOPLE COMING HOME TO SEND

03:21:34.282 --> 03:21:36.651
COMMUNITIES- IT DOES NOT

03:21:36.717 --> 03:21:38.619
CORRELATE TO HIGHER CRIME RATES

03:21:38.686 --> 03:21:39.253
OF THE FACT THAT THERE'S THIS

03:21:39.320 --> 03:21:41.956
FEAR THAT IT'S A PUBLIC SAFETY

03:21:42.023 --> 03:21:43.558
CONCERN THE WAS VALID. IS NOT

03:21:43.624 --> 03:21:44.725
SHOWING THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE

03:21:44.792 --> 03:21:46.861
INCREASED SPIKE OF CRIMES OR

03:21:46.928 --> 03:21:49.230
ANYTHING LIKE THAT. WE HAVE

BEEN SENTENCING PEOPLE TO

03:21:50.364 --> 03:21:51.699
REALLY LONG SENTENCES

03:21:51.766 --> 03:21:54.635
UNNECESSARILY AND THAT IS

03:21:54.702 --> 03:21:55.803
SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE.

03:21:55.870 --> 03:21:57.271
CONTINUALLY WORKED ON AND

03:21:57.338 --> 03:21:59.207

03:21:59.273 --> 03:22:00.441
THAT ONE THING THAT REALLY DOES

03:22:00.508 --> 03:22:01.409
HELP PEOPLE COMING HOME

03:22:01.476 --> 03:22:03.177
RETURNING HOME IS INVESTING IN

03:22:03.244 --> 03:22:04.679
COMMUNITY CARE PROGRAM SO

03:22:04.745 --> 03:22:06.681

PEOPLE RETURNING HOME- ANOTHER

03:22:10.017 --> 03:22:13.955
WAY TO MITIGATE THIS ISSUE OF

03:22:14.021 --> 03:22:15.756
RECIDIVISM IS TO ALLOW FOR

03:22:15.823 --> 03:22:17.191
START OF JUSTICE PROGRAMMING

03:22:17.258 --> 03:22:18.826
BOTH ON THE FRONT AND IS AS A

03:22:18.893 --> 03:22:20.895
DIVERSION. AND ALSO FOR PEOPLE

03:22:20.962 --> 03:22:22.396
COMING HOME AND SHOULD NOT BE

03:22:22.463 --> 03:22:24.398
DONE JUST FOR YOUNG PEOPLE ALSO

03:22:24.465 --> 03:22:26.167
FOR ADULTS. I'M CURRENTLY IN

03:22:26.234 --> 03:22:27.735
ALAMEDA COUNTY IN SOME SCHOOL

03:22:27.802 --> 03:22:29.604
COUNTY WE HAVE. RESTORATIVE

03:22:29.670 --> 03:22:31.839
JUSTICE DIVERSION PROGRAMS FOR

MINORS FOR YOUNG PEOPLE THAT

03:22:32.607 --> 03:22:34.809
ARE. POTENTIALLY GOING TO BE

03:22:34.876 --> 03:22:37.411
CHARGED WITH SOMETHING. OF WHEN

03:22:37.478 --> 03:22:38.346
THEY PARTICIPANTS DIVERSION

03:22:38.412 --> 03:22:40.982
PROGRAM THEY ARE THEN TRACKED.

03:22:41.048 --> 03:22:43.985
OF THREE YEARS AFTER. AFTER

03:22:44.051 --> 03:22:44.552
COMPLETING THIS RESTORED OF

03:22:44.619 --> 03:22:46.554
PROGRAM. WHEN THEY'RE TRIED WE

03:22:46.621 --> 03:22:47.588
CAN SEE THAT IN SOME CISCO

03:22:47.655 --> 03:22:49.824
COUNTY THE RECIDIVISM RATE FOR

03:22:49.891 --> 03:22:50.825
THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE THAT

03:22:50.892 --> 03:22:53.327
PARTICIPATED IN THE CIRCLES ARE

03:22:53.394 --> 03:22:55.763
LESS THAN TEN PERCENT. SO LET'S

03:22:55.830 --> 03:22:57.131
BEEN PERCENT OF PEOPLE OF THE

03:22:57.198 --> 03:22:58.232

PROGRAM AT IN ALAMEDA COUNTY

03:23:04.672 --> 03:23:06.908
THAT NUMBER IS LESS THAN 20% SO

03:23:06.974 --> 03:23:09.043
WE CAN SEE THAT THE OUR NUMBERS

03:23:09.110 --> 03:23:12.446
WE HAVE EVIDENCE. IS THAT I CAN.

03:23:12.513 --> 03:23:14.749
THAT CAN CURB AND CAN PEOPLE

03:23:14.815 --> 03:23:15.583
OUT OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE

03:23:15.650 --> 03:23:17.018
SYSTEM. AND ON TOP OF THAT

03:23:17.084 --> 03:23:18.286
RESTORED OF JUSTICE DOES

03:23:18.352 --> 03:23:19.587
SOMETHING THAT OUR CURRENT

03:23:19.654 --> 03:23:21.289
SYSTEM LACKS. IT DOES NOT A

03:23:21.355 --> 03:23:23.057
RESERVE JUST AS HOLD THE SPACE

03:23:23.124 --> 03:23:24.425

THINGS OUT TO COME TO.

03:23:36.237 --> 03:23:38.272
SOLUTIONS AND TO ALSO LOOK AT

03:23:38.339 --> 03:23:39.674
OKAY WELL WHAT BECAUSE THE

03:23:39.740 --> 03:23:41.676
SITUATION TO HAPPEN AND WHY WE

03:23:41.742 --> 03:23:43.077
CAN BE SAVING A LOT OF MONEY

03:23:43.144 --> 03:23:45.513
AND HOPEFULLY BE DRIVING DOWN

03:23:45.580 --> 03:23:47.181
THE POPULATION OF INCARCERATION

03:23:47.248 --> 03:23:50.318
WERE DIVERTED PEOPLE AWAY. AND

03:23:50.384 --> 03:23:52.887

CONSERVATION THE LAST THING

03:24:07.668 --> 03:24:09.236
THEY NEED IS TO BE AN

03:24:09.303 --> 03:24:10.037
ENVIRONMENT THAT MIMICS

03:24:10.104 --> 03:24:12.340

AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND THAT'S

03:24:14.475 --> 03:24:15.276
THE PROBLEM THAT WE ARE SEEING

03:24:15.343 --> 03:24:17.144
CONTINUOUSLY AND BEST PRACTICES

03:24:17.211 --> 03:24:19.180

03:24:33.361 --> 03:24:34.996
PLEASURE TO BE IN A ROOM FOR A

03:24:35.062 --> 03:24:36.197
SERIOUS CONVERSATION ABOUT

CLOSING PRESENCE IN CALIFORNIA

03:24:38.099 --> 03:24:39.433

03:24:39.500 --> 03:24:41.268
BY URGING FOLKS TO HAVE A

03:24:41.335 --> 03:24:42.536
SERIOUS CONVERSATION ABOUT NOT

03:24:42.603 --> 03:24:44.171
JUST CLOSING ONE PRISON BUT

03:24:44.238 --> 03:24:44.872
THINKING ABOUT WHAT IT WOULD

03:24:44.939 --> 03:24:46.774
TAKE TO CLOSE THREE FOUR FIVE

03:24:46.841 --> 03:24:48.709

COULD LEAD TO THESE KINDS OF

03:24:53.247 --> 03:24:54.348
CLOSURES AND I THINK THE THING

03:24:54.415 --> 03:24:55.583
THAT I'D LIKE TO FOCUS ON TODAY

03:24:55.650 --> 03:24:57.718
IS AROUND SENTENCING- WE HEARD

03:24:57.785 --> 03:24:59.186
EARLIER FROM MISTER GRAVES THAT

03:24:59.253 --> 03:25:00.321
THE RESEARCH DOES NOT SUPPORT

03:25:00.388 --> 03:25:01.889
THAT LONGER SENTENCES MEANS

03:25:01.956 --> 03:25:04.392
BETTER PUBLIC SAFETY AND WE'VE

03:25:04.458 --> 03:25:06.560
HEARD- EXAMPLES TODAY OF WAYS

03:25:06.627 --> 03:25:07.828
THAT WE CAN DO THAT REPEALING

03:25:07.895 --> 03:25:09.697
THREE STRIKES HI MISTER WILEY

POINT OUT THAT ABOUT 24% OF THE

03:25:30.685 --> 03:25:32.319

THAT'S WAY HIGHER AS A

03:25:36.824 --> 03:25:38.025
PROPORTION THAN IT'S EVER BEEN

03:25:38.092 --> 03:25:39.160
IN AS WE DISCUSSED TODAY THAT'S

03:25:39.226 --> 03:25:40.561
BECAUSE OF THE LEGACY OF

03:25:40.628 --> 03:25:42.663
EXTREME SENTENCING. CURB IS

03:25:42.730 --> 03:25:44.699

THRESHOLD FOR OLDER PAROLE

03:25:45.900 --> 03:25:47.968

03:25:57.778 --> 03:25:58.946
OUR RECOMMENDATION OF THAT. THE

03:25:59.013 --> 03:25:59.714
OTHER PIECE I WANT TO TALK

03:25:59.780 --> 03:26:01.449
ABOUT TODAY IS THAT IN RECENT

03:26:01.515 --> 03:26:02.283
YEARS THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF

03:26:02.349 --> 03:26:03.818
LEGISLATION AND HISTORIC

03:26:03.884 --> 03:26:05.386
LEGISLATION THAT'S BEEN PASSED.

03:26:05.453 --> 03:26:07.388
WITH REDUCED- AND ELIMINATED

RETROACTIVE- NOW THERE'S A LOT

03:26:12.193 --> 03:26:13.427
OF REASONS FOR THAT ONE OF

03:26:13.494 --> 03:26:14.428
WHICH IS THAT IT WOULD COST A

03:26:14.495 --> 03:26:16.464
LOT OF MONEY TO MAKE IT THOSE

03:26:16.530 --> 03:26:17.698
BILLS RETROACTIVE INTO APPLY

03:26:17.765 --> 03:26:19.266
THOSE SENTENCE ENHANCEMENTS

03:26:19.333 --> 03:26:20.634
REPEALS TO PEOPLE THAT ARE

THEM. WHAT I WAS HEARING TODAY

03:26:23.971 --> 03:26:24.405
IS THAT WE'RE CURRENTLY

03:26:24.472 --> 03:26:25.706
SPENDING THIRTEEN AND A HALF

03:26:25.773 --> 03:26:27.742
BILLION DOLLARS ON CORRECTIONS

03:26:27.808 --> 03:26:30.311
IN IN OUR STATE AND WE'VE GOT

03:26:30.377 --> 03:26:31.178
TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS. OF

03:26:34.482 --> 03:26:35.783
WHEN I THINK ABOUT THAT AND I

03:26:35.850 --> 03:26:37.752
THINK IN THE LONG RUN IN THE

03:26:37.818 --> 03:26:39.186
LONG TERM AT THE HIGH. LEVEL

03:26:39.253 --> 03:26:40.688
ABOUT WHAT IT TAKES. A LONG

03:26:40.755 --> 03:26:43.624
TERM. ABLE REDUCTIONS IN PRISON
