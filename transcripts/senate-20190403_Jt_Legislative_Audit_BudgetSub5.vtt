AVERAGE EVERY NINETY TWO SECONDS.

00:37:24.508 --> 00:37:27.411
A FORCIBLE RAPE OCCURS EVERY SIX

00:37:27.478 --> 00:37:28.980
POINT TWO MINUTES.

00:37:29.046 --> 00:37:30.848
WITHIN THE UNITED STATES NEARLY

00:37:30.915 --> 00:37:32.283

QUARTER LEAD TO AN ARREST.

00:38:16.794 --> 00:38:18.529
VAST MAJORITY OF SEXUAL ASSAULT

STATEWIDE LEVEL RELATED TO A

00:46:28.118 --> 00:46:29.720
LACK OF INFORMATION ABOUT SEXUAL

00:46:29.786 --> 00:46:31.421
ASSAULT EVIDENCE KITS WE REALLY

00:46:31.488 --> 00:46:32.789
FOUND THAT THERE WAS -- NO

00:46:32.856 --> 00:46:34.224

THOSE KIDS EXISTED IN THE STATE

00:46:35.225 --> 00:46:36.527
OF CALIFORNIA HOW MANY OF THEM

00:46:36.593 --> 00:46:37.661
WERE BEING SUBMITTED FOR

00:46:37.728 --> 00:46:39.396
ANALYSIS AND WHAT HAPPENS AS A

00:46:39.463 --> 00:46:41.465
RESULT OF THAT ANALYSIS -- THOSE

00:46:41.532 --> 00:46:43.133
WERE THE KEY AREAS WHERE WE MADE

00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:44.868
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT THERE BE

00:46:44.935 --> 00:46:46.203
MORE INFORMATION GATHERING.

00:46:46.270 --> 00:46:47.437
BY WAY OF BACKGROUND THOUGH A

00:46:47.504 --> 00:46:49.006
SEXUAL ASSAULT EVIDENCE KID IS

00:46:49.072 --> 00:46:51.875
THE BY PRODUCT OF A VICTIM WHO

00:46:51.942 --> 00:46:53.243
REPORTS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT THE

00:46:53.310 --> 00:46:54.745
SIDING TO UNDERGO AN INVASIVE

00:46:54.811 --> 00:46:56.346
MEDICAL EXAMINATION.

00:46:56.413 --> 00:46:57.915
DURING THAT EXAM A TRAINED

00:46:57.981 --> 00:46:59.283
MEDICAL EXAMINER WILL ATTEMPT TO

00:46:59.349 --> 00:47:00.417
COLLECT EVIDENCE FROM THE

00:47:00.484 --> 00:47:02.052
VICTIM'S BODY THAT HOPEFULLY

00:47:02.119 --> 00:47:03.787
WILL CONTAIN A DNA PROFILE

00:47:03.854 --> 00:47:05.556
RELATED TO THE SUSPECT IN THE

00:47:05.622 --> 00:47:06.723
INVESTIGATION.

00:47:06.790 --> 00:47:08.225
THAT COULD BE POTENTIALLY VERY

00:47:08.292 --> 00:47:09.326
VALUABLE TO THE INVESTIGATORS

00:47:09.393 --> 00:47:10.827
AND THE PROSECUTORS OF IN THAT

00:47:10.894 --> 00:47:13.130
CASE BUT IT'S ONLY ACCESSIBLE TO

00:47:13.197 --> 00:47:14.097
THEM IF THEY THEN SUBMIT THAT

00:47:14.164 --> 00:47:17.935
KIT TO A CRIME LAB FOR ANALYSIS --

00:47:18.001 --> 00:47:19.436
CRIME LABS WHEN THEY ANALYZE A

00:47:19.503 --> 00:47:20.537
SEXUAL ASSAULT EVIDENCE KIT

00:47:20.604 --> 00:47:21.805
THEY'RE ATTEMPTING TO ATTAIN

00:47:21.872 --> 00:47:24.107
THAT DNA PROFILE FOR FOR A

00:47:24.174 --> 00:47:25.842
SUSPECT IN THE INVESTIGATION AND

00:47:25.909 --> 00:47:26.743
IF THEY'RE SUCCESSFUL IN DOING

00:47:26.810 --> 00:47:28.478
THAT THEY CAN UPLOAD THE PROFILE

00:47:28.545 --> 00:47:29.846
TO WHAT IS KNOWN AS CODIS WHICH

00:47:29.913 --> 00:47:32.449
IS THE COMBINED DNA INDEX SYSTEM.

00:47:32.516 --> 00:47:34.218
CURTIS IS A NETWORK OF DATABASES

00:47:34.284 --> 00:47:35.352
THAT STRETCHES ACROSS THE

00:47:35.419 --> 00:47:36.553
COUNTRY THE CONTAINS DENY

00:47:36.620 --> 00:47:38.555
PROFILES FOR MULTIPLE MANY MANY

00:47:38.622 --> 00:47:39.856
INDIVIDUALS.

00:47:39.923 --> 00:47:40.857
AND THE HOPE IS THAT WHEN YOU

00:47:40.924 --> 00:47:43.493
UPLOAD A DNA PROFILE FROM AN

00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:44.995
EVIDENCE KIT INTO CODIS.

00:47:45.062 --> 00:47:45.963
BUT IT WILL THEN MATCH AGAINST

00:47:46.029 --> 00:47:47.598
ANOTHER PROFILE THAT'S ALREADY

00:47:47.664 --> 00:47:48.665
IN THE SYSTEM AND COULD

00:47:48.732 --> 00:47:50.567
POTENTIALLY PROVIDE YOU THE NAME

00:47:50.634 --> 00:47:52.402
OF THE SUSPECT -- IN ONE

00:47:52.469 --> 00:47:53.870
PARTICULAR CASE WE REVIEWED

00:47:53.937 --> 00:47:55.372
DURING THE FOLLOW ABOUT IT WE

00:47:55.439 --> 00:47:56.840
WERE ABLE TO IDENTIFY THAT LOCAL

00:47:56.907 --> 00:47:58.208
LAW ENFORCEMENT TOOK.

00:47:58.275 --> 00:47:59.476
THE STATEMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN

00:47:59.543 --> 00:48:00.877
PROVIDED TO THEM BY THE VICTIM

00:48:00.944 --> 00:48:02.446
COMBINED WITH A HIT WHICH IS

00:48:02.512 --> 00:48:03.680
WHAT THAT MATCHES CALLED FROM

00:48:03.747 --> 00:48:05.515
THE CODIS SYSTEM THAT NAME TO

00:48:05.582 --> 00:48:06.316
THE SUSPECT.

00:48:06.383 --> 00:48:07.918
AND IN COMBINATION THOSE TWO

00:48:07.985 --> 00:48:09.419
PIECES OF EVIDENCE WERE CRITICAL

00:48:09.486 --> 00:48:10.921
TO THEM ARRESTING THE SUSPECT

00:48:10.988 --> 00:48:12.589
AND FORWARDING THE CASE TO THE

00:48:12.656 --> 00:48:14.925
PROSECUTOR FOR PROSECUTION.

00:48:14.992 --> 00:48:16.260
SO IT'S REALLY VALUABLE EVIDENCE

00:48:16.326 --> 00:48:17.261
I'M IN INFORMATION THAT

00:48:17.327 --> 00:48:19.363
INVESTIGATORS COULD HAVE ACCESS

00:48:19.429 --> 00:48:20.731
TO BUT DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO

00:48:20.797 --> 00:48:22.466
UNLESS THEY MAKE THAT SUBMITTAL

00:48:22.532 --> 00:48:23.834
TO A CRIME LAB.

00:48:23.900 --> 00:48:24.901
IN OUR ORIGINAL AUDIT REPORT WE

00:48:24.968 --> 00:48:27.204
REVIEWED THREE AGENCIES AS THE

00:48:27.271 --> 00:48:28.572
STATE AUDITOR INDICATED.

00:48:28.639 --> 00:48:29.640
NOT ALL OF THE SEXUAL ASSAULT

00:48:29.706 --> 00:48:30.941
EVIDENCE KITS AT THOSE AGENCIES

00:48:31.008 --> 00:48:32.209
HAD BEEN SUBMITTED TO THEIR

00:48:32.276 --> 00:48:33.577
RESPECTIVE CRIME LABS.

00:48:33.644 --> 00:48:35.312
IT WAS RIGHT AROUND 50% OF THE

00:48:35.379 --> 00:48:36.747
TIME WE CONDUCTED THE ORIGINAL

00:48:36.813 --> 00:48:37.381
AUDIT THAT'S WHAT OUR REVIEW

00:48:37.447 --> 00:48:39.383
SHOWED ABOUT 50% HAVE BEEN

00:48:39.449 --> 00:48:41.218
SUBMITTED AND ABOUT 50% HAD NOT

00:48:41.285 --> 00:48:42.185
BEEN SUBMITTED.

00:48:42.252 --> 00:48:43.086
AND THE LAW ENFORCEMENT

00:48:43.153 --> 00:48:44.788
INVESTIGATORS ARE PROVIDED AS A

00:48:44.855 --> 00:48:46.223
VARIETY OF REASONS FOR WHY THEY

00:48:46.290 --> 00:48:48.558
DIDN'T FOR THE THE EVIDENCE GETS

00:48:48.625 --> 00:48:51.528
TO THE CRIME LABS FOR ANALYSIS.

00:48:51.595 --> 00:48:53.430
BUT AS I SAID BEFORE STATEWIDE

00:48:53.497 --> 00:48:56.033
THERE'S NO DATA OR THERE WAS NO

00:48:56.099 --> 00:48:56.667
DATA THEN AND THERE IS NO DATA

00:48:56.733 --> 00:48:56.867
NOW.

00:48:56.933 --> 00:48:58.568
ON HOW MANY OF THOSE KIDS EXISTS

00:48:58.635 --> 00:49:00.003
STATEWIDE.

00:49:00.070 --> 00:49:01.071
HOW MANY OF THEM HAVE BEEN

00:49:01.138 --> 00:49:02.973
SUBMITTED AND AND A KEY PIECE OF

00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:04.041
INFORMATION IS WHAT ARE THE

00:49:04.107 --> 00:49:05.676
REASONS WHY KIDS ARE NOT BEING

00:49:05.742 --> 00:49:06.576
SUBMITTED TO CRIME LABS AS I

00:49:06.643 --> 00:49:07.911
MENTIONED THE LAW ENFORCEMENT

00:49:07.978 --> 00:49:09.379
AGENCIES WE VISITED GAVE US

00:49:09.446 --> 00:49:10.814
REASONS SUCH AS?

00:49:10.881 --> 00:49:12.249
HAVING BEEN ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY

00:49:12.316 --> 00:49:14.017
ARREST A SUSPECT WITHOUT THE KID

00:49:14.084 --> 00:49:16.086
AN ANALYSIS OR HAVING DETERMINED

00:49:16.153 --> 00:49:17.921
THAT -- THE ISSUE WAS ONE OF

00:49:17.988 --> 00:49:19.990
CONSENT WHICH IS AN ISSUE THEY

00:49:20.057 --> 00:49:21.458
FEEL LIKE IT'S NOT RESOLVABLE

00:49:21.525 --> 00:49:22.759
THROUGH DNA EVIDENCE.

00:49:22.826 --> 00:49:23.760
BUT REGARDLESS WE DON'T HAVE

00:49:23.827 --> 00:49:25.862
STATEWIDE DATA ON WHETHER THOSE

00:49:25.929 --> 00:49:27.764
OF THE REASONS STATEWIDE FOR WHY

00:49:27.831 --> 00:49:30.067
LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES ARE

00:49:30.133 --> 00:49:31.401
MAKING THOSE DECISIONS.

00:49:31.468 --> 00:49:32.336
SO KEY RECOMMENDATION FROM OUR

00:49:32.402 --> 00:49:33.637
ORIGINAL AUDIT REPORT WAS THAT

00:49:33.704 --> 00:49:34.905
THE LEGISLATURE REQUIRE THE

00:49:34.971 --> 00:49:36.440
REPORTING OF THAT INFORMATION

00:49:36.506 --> 00:49:38.108
THOSE THREE KEY DATA POINTS.

00:49:38.175 --> 00:49:40.077
HOW MANY KIDS EXIST HOW MANY OF

00:49:40.143 --> 00:49:41.545
BEEN SUBMITTED AND NOT SUBMITTED

00:49:41.611 --> 00:49:42.546
FOR TESTING?

00:49:42.612 --> 00:49:44.314
AND THEN THE REASONS WHY KIDS

00:49:44.381 --> 00:49:46.149
WERE NOT TURNED IN FOR TESTING --

00:49:46.216 --> 00:49:47.284
THE LEGISLATURE ADOPTED THAT

00:49:47.351 --> 00:49:48.719
RECOMMENDATION THAT IS NOW STATE

00:49:48.785 --> 00:49:50.320
LAW AND THE FIRST REPORT ON THE

00:49:50.387 --> 00:49:52.556
OF LOCALS TO JUSTICE.

00:49:52.622 --> 00:49:53.924
AND THAT JUSTICE IS REPORT TO

00:49:53.990 --> 00:49:55.192
THE LEGISLATURE IS DUE SOMETIME

00:49:55.258 --> 00:49:57.027
SOON SO HOPEFULLY WE'LL BE ABLE

00:49:57.094 --> 00:49:58.528
TO ACCESS THAT -- IMPORTANT AND

00:49:58.595 --> 00:50:00.831
VITAL -- INFORMATION ABOUT

00:50:00.897 --> 00:50:01.431
SEXUAL ASSAULT EVIDENCE GETS

00:50:01.498 --> 00:50:04.634
SOON IN TERMS OF HOW MANY EXIST.

00:50:04.701 --> 00:50:05.602
REAL QUICKLY THOUGH BEFORE I

00:50:05.669 --> 00:50:06.937
TURN IT OVER TO MISS MEL IN OUR

00:50:07.003 --> 00:50:08.505
SECOND KEY RECOMMENDATION WAS

00:50:08.572 --> 00:50:09.973
RELATED TO THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:11.742
JUSTICE'S RADS PROGRAM.

00:50:11.808 --> 00:50:12.876
THAT PROGRAM IS UNIQUE IN

00:50:12.943 --> 00:50:14.411
CALIFORNIA BECAUSE IT IS THE

00:50:14.478 --> 00:50:16.380
STATE'S FUND THE STATE FUNDED

00:50:16.446 --> 00:50:18.782
PROGRAM TO TEST ALL SEXUAL

00:50:18.849 --> 00:50:19.850
ASSAULT EVIDENCE KITS.

00:50:19.916 --> 00:50:21.218
AND THAT PROGRAM THE KIDS GO

00:50:21.284 --> 00:50:22.452
FROM THE MEDICAL EXAMINER

00:50:22.519 --> 00:50:23.653
STRAIGHT TO THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:50:23.720 --> 00:50:25.088
JUSTICE CRIME LAB THEY DON'T

00:50:25.155 --> 00:50:26.456
PASSED THROUGH THE INVESTIGATOR

00:50:26.523 --> 00:50:29.126
SO THAT THE INVESTIGATOR DECIDES

00:50:29.192 --> 00:50:29.659
WHETHER TO FOUR DIFFERENT

00:50:29.726 --> 00:50:30.494
ALICE'S OR NOT.

00:50:30.560 --> 00:50:31.461
THAT KEY DIFFERENCE MAYES THE

00:50:31.528 --> 00:50:33.530
MADE THE PROGRAM UNIQUE IN

00:50:33.597 --> 00:50:34.164
TWENTY FOURTEEN AND THEN STILL

00:50:34.231 --> 00:50:35.399
MAKES IT UNIQUE TODAY AS THE

00:50:35.465 --> 00:50:36.800
STATE'S FUNDING THAT PROGRAM.

00:50:36.867 --> 00:50:37.734
AND WE SAW THAT AS AN

00:50:37.801 --> 00:50:39.035
OPPORTUNITY TO COLLECT

00:50:39.102 --> 00:50:40.370
INFORMATION THAT GOES BEYOND

00:50:40.437 --> 00:50:41.204
JUST WHETHER THE KITS WERE

00:50:41.271 --> 00:50:42.739
TESTED OR NOT BUT ALSO WHAT

00:50:42.806 --> 00:50:44.641
HAPPENS AFTERWARDS WHAT KIND OF

00:50:44.708 --> 00:50:45.942
POSITIVE CASE OUTCOME

00:50:46.009 --> 00:50:47.544
INFORMATION COULD WE LEARN ABOUT

00:50:47.611 --> 00:50:48.879
THOSE CASES WERE SUSPECTS

00:50:48.945 --> 00:50:50.247
ARRESTED AS A RESULT OF THAT

00:50:50.313 --> 00:50:51.114
ANALYSIS.

00:50:51.181 --> 00:50:52.382
WERE THEY CONVICTED AS A RESULT

00:50:52.449 --> 00:50:53.517
OF THAT ANALYSIS.

00:50:53.583 --> 00:50:54.751
SO WE RECOMMENDED THAT THE

00:50:54.818 --> 00:50:55.685
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE COLLECT

00:50:55.752 --> 00:50:57.120
THAT INFORMATION FROM ALL OF THE

00:50:57.187 --> 00:50:57.854
DIFFERENT AGENCIES THAT

00:50:57.921 --> 00:51:00.123
PARTICIPATE IN ITS RATS PROGRAM.

00:51:00.190 --> 00:51:01.191
AND THEN REPORT THAT INFORMATION

00:51:01.258 --> 00:51:02.426
TO THE LEGISLATURE AGAIN

00:51:02.492 --> 00:51:03.627
INCREASING THE AVAILABLE

00:51:03.693 --> 00:51:05.996
STATEWIDE INFORMATION ABOUT

00:51:06.062 --> 00:51:06.963
THESE KIDS.

00:51:07.030 --> 00:51:08.231
NOW IN THE YEARS SINCE WE'VE

00:51:08.298 --> 00:51:09.299
DONE OUR ORIGINAL AUDIT THE

00:51:09.366 --> 00:51:10.634
DEPARTMENT JUSTICE HAS AT LEAST

00:51:10.700 --> 00:51:12.102
AMENDED ITS AGREEMENTS WITH THE

00:51:12.169 --> 00:51:13.570
AGENCIES THAT PARTICIPATE IN THE

00:51:13.637 --> 00:51:15.405
RATS PROGRAM. TO ASK THEM TO

00:51:15.472 --> 00:51:17.073
PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION BUT FOR

00:51:17.140 --> 00:51:18.542
A FEW YEARS NOW WE HAVEN'T SEEN

00:51:18.608 --> 00:51:20.310
JUSTICE ACTUALLY PROVIDE THAT

00:51:20.377 --> 00:51:21.978
CASE OUTCOME INFORMATION TO THE

00:51:22.045 --> 00:51:23.447
LEGISLATURE AND THAT'S WHAT

00:51:23.513 --> 00:51:25.081
PROMPTED OUR FOLLOW UP EFFORT.

00:51:25.148 --> 00:51:26.583
AND THAT'S THE EFFORT THAT MISS

00:51:26.650 --> 00:51:27.150
MELONS GOING TO DESCRIBE YOU

00:51:27.217 --> 00:51:28.185
KNOW.

00:51:28.251 --> 00:51:29.152
THANK YOU MORNING HI MY NAME IS

00:51:29.219 --> 00:51:31.054
AMANDA MILLEN AND AGAIN I WAS

00:51:31.121 --> 00:51:32.489
THE AUDIT SUPERVISOR ON THE

00:51:32.556 --> 00:51:34.057
FOLLOW UP ON IT.

00:51:34.124 --> 00:51:36.092
SO DURING OUR FOLLOW UP WE FOUND

00:51:36.159 --> 00:51:37.260
THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

00:51:37.327 --> 00:51:39.262
HAD VERY LITTLE INFORMATION ON

00:51:39.329 --> 00:51:41.298
CASE OUTCOMES ASSOCIATED WITH

00:51:41.364 --> 00:51:42.766
THE HITS THAT IT PROVIDED.

00:51:42.833 --> 00:51:45.368
IT HAD NO INFORMATION WHATSOEVER

00:51:45.435 --> 00:51:48.638
ABOUT 67% OF THOSE CASES MEANING

00:51:48.705 --> 00:51:50.474
IT DIDN'T KNOW WHETHER SOMEONE

00:51:50.540 --> 00:51:52.008
HAD BEEN CONVICTED WHETHER

00:51:52.075 --> 00:51:53.577
SOMEONE HAD BEEN ARRESTED OR

00:51:53.643 --> 00:51:55.111
EVEN WHETHER INVESTIGATORS HAD

00:51:55.178 --> 00:51:57.581
EVEN INVESTIGATED THOSE HITS.

00:51:57.647 --> 00:51:58.682
AND AS A RESULT IN HAVE THAT

00:51:58.748 --> 00:51:59.850
INFORMATION TO PROVIDE TO THE

00:51:59.916 --> 00:52:01.051
LEGISLATURE.

00:52:01.117 --> 00:52:02.419
AND WE FOUND THAT THE REASON

00:52:02.486 --> 00:52:02.919
THAT IT DIDN'T HAVE THE

00:52:02.986 --> 00:52:04.821
INFORMATION IS THAT IT HAD MADE

00:52:04.888 --> 00:52:06.823
A LACKLUSTER EFFORT TO OBTAIN

00:52:06.890 --> 00:52:08.291
THAT INFORMATION.

00:52:08.358 --> 00:52:09.826
WE FOUND THAT IT HADN'T EVEN

00:52:09.893 --> 00:52:12.162
TOLD MOST RATS PARTICIPANTS THAT

00:52:12.229 --> 00:52:12.929
THEY SHOULD PROVIDE THE

00:52:12.996 --> 00:52:14.231
INFORMATION.

00:52:14.297 --> 00:52:15.565
IT HADN'T TRAIN MOST READ

00:52:15.632 --> 00:52:17.434
PARTICIPANTS ON HOW TO REPORT

00:52:17.501 --> 00:52:18.869
THAT INFORMATION AND HADN'T

00:52:18.935 --> 00:52:19.903
PROVIDED GUIDANCE ON HOW TO

00:52:19.970 --> 00:52:21.071
REPORT THAT.

00:52:21.137 --> 00:52:22.806
AND WE FOUND IN THE LIMITED DATA

00:52:22.873 --> 00:52:24.074
THAT JUSTICE DID HAVE

00:52:24.140 --> 00:52:26.376
INACCURACIES AN OUTDATED

00:52:26.443 --> 00:52:28.345
INFORMATION AS A RESULT OF THAT.

00:52:28.411 --> 00:52:29.846
AS A RESULT OF ALL OF THIS

00:52:29.913 --> 00:52:31.748
JUSTICE MISS A VERY REAL

00:52:31.815 --> 00:52:33.750
OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE VALUABLE

00:52:33.817 --> 00:52:34.951
INFORMATION.

00:52:35.018 --> 00:52:36.820
THAT COULD BE HELPFUL IN THE

00:52:36.887 --> 00:52:39.289
EFFORT TO FURTHER SEXUAL ASSAULT

00:52:39.356 --> 00:52:40.891
INVESTIGATIONS.

00:52:40.957 --> 00:52:42.559
MORE THAN THAT WE FOUND THAT

00:52:42.626 --> 00:52:44.094
CASE OUTCOME INFORMATION WOULD

00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:47.030
BE A VERY HELPFUL TOOL.

00:52:47.097 --> 00:52:49.099
IN THE EFFORT TO IMPROVE SEXUAL

00:52:49.165 --> 00:52:51.201
ASSAULT CASE INVESTIGATIONS EVEN

00:52:51.268 --> 00:52:52.702
IF THE LEGISLATURE DOES MANDATE

00:52:52.769 --> 00:52:54.170
THAT ALL SEXUAL ASSAULT KIT

00:52:54.237 --> 00:52:55.372
SHOULD BE TESTED.

00:52:55.438 --> 00:52:57.340
AND THAT'S BECAUSE CASE OUTCOME

00:52:57.407 --> 00:53:00.210
INFORMATION COULD SHOW US WHAT

00:53:00.277 --> 00:53:02.178
BARRIERS ARE OUT THERE THAT ARE

00:53:02.245 --> 00:53:03.246
PREVENTING SEXUAL ASSAULT

00:53:03.313 --> 00:53:06.116
INVESTIGATIONS FROM HAPPENING.

00:53:06.182 --> 00:53:08.151
RECENT RESEARCH INTO THE REASONS

00:53:08.218 --> 00:53:10.053
WHY SEXUAL ASSAULT KITS ARE NOT

00:53:10.120 --> 00:53:11.321
TESTED WHEN THEY SHOULD HAVE

00:53:11.388 --> 00:53:12.289
BEEN TESTED.

00:53:12.355 --> 00:53:14.691
HAVE FOUND A NUMBER OF PROBLEMS

00:53:14.758 --> 00:53:15.859
THEY FOUND THAT THERE ARE

00:53:15.926 --> 00:53:17.727
IMPLICIT BIASES AND SOME LAW

00:53:17.794 --> 00:53:19.329
ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS THAT

00:53:19.396 --> 00:53:22.365
PREDISPOSE THEM TO NOT BELIEVING

00:53:22.432 --> 00:53:24.467
A VICTIM OR TO ADD BELIEVE THAT

00:53:24.534 --> 00:53:25.569
THEY ARE NOT WILLING TO

00:53:25.635 --> 00:53:28.104
PARTICIPATE IN THE PROCESS -- IT

00:53:28.171 --> 00:53:29.439
IS ALSO SHOWN THAT THERE'S JUST

00:53:29.506 --> 00:53:30.774
A LACK OF INVESTIGATIVE

00:53:30.840 --> 00:53:32.208
RESOURCES AT A LOT OF LAW

00:53:32.275 --> 00:53:33.276
ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO

00:53:33.343 --> 00:53:34.811
INVESTIGATE CASES.

00:53:34.878 --> 00:53:36.746
INCLUDING SEXUAL ASSAULT CASES

00:53:36.813 --> 00:53:39.616
THOSE BARRIERS DO NOT GO AWAY

00:53:39.683 --> 00:53:40.951
WHEN THE KID IS TESTED.

00:53:41.017 --> 00:53:43.353
THOSE BARRIERS CAN AND DO STILL

00:53:43.420 --> 00:53:45.155
PREVENT SEXUAL ASSAULT CASES

00:53:45.221 --> 00:53:46.256
FROM BEING INVESTIGATED AND

00:53:46.323 --> 00:53:48.892
PROSECUTED EVEN AFTER THERE IS A

00:53:48.959 --> 00:53:52.829
HIT -- SO FOR EXAMPLE.

00:53:52.896 --> 00:53:53.964
THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF

00:53:54.030 --> 00:53:55.799
JUSTICE RECENTLY ISSUED SEVERAL

00:53:55.865 --> 00:53:58.201
GRANTS TO LAW ENFORCEMENT

00:53:58.268 --> 00:54:00.236
AGENCIES THROUGHOUT THE NATION.

00:54:00.303 --> 00:54:02.138
TO ADDRESS ON TESTING KITS THREE

00:54:02.205 --> 00:54:04.774
CITIES RECEIVED GRANTS. TO

00:54:04.841 --> 00:54:07.143
ADDRESS NOT UNTESTED KITS BUT TO

00:54:07.210 --> 00:54:08.845
ADDRESS HITS THAT THEY GOT FROM

00:54:08.912 --> 00:54:10.847
TESTED KIDS BECAUSE THEY NOW HAD

00:54:10.914 --> 00:54:13.683
A BACKLOG OF HITS RATHER THAN

00:54:13.750 --> 00:54:16.086
KIDS ONE OF THOSE CITIES IS

00:54:16.152 --> 00:54:17.654
FRESNO CALIFORNIA.

00:54:17.721 --> 00:54:20.390
FRESNO HAS SEVEN HUNDRED HITS

00:54:20.457 --> 00:54:22.392
SITTING ON ITS SHELVES GOING ON

00:54:22.459 --> 00:54:24.527
INVESTIGATED BECAUSE BEFORE THEY

00:54:24.594 --> 00:54:25.662
GOT THE GRANT THEY DID NOT HAVE

00:54:25.729 --> 00:54:27.897
THE RESOURCES TO INVESTIGATE

00:54:27.964 --> 00:54:28.932
THOSE HITS.

00:54:28.999 --> 00:54:30.967
AND THAT CAN HAVE DEVASTATING

00:54:31.034 --> 00:54:32.369
REPERCUSSIONS WELL WE HEARD

00:54:32.435 --> 00:54:34.604
RECENTLY ABOUT A CASE OUT OF

00:54:34.671 --> 00:54:36.640
NORTH CAROLINA WERE A LITTLE

00:54:36.706 --> 00:54:38.475
THIRTEEN YEAR OLD GIRL WAS RAPED

00:54:38.541 --> 00:54:40.176
AND MURDERED AND HER BODY WAS

00:54:40.243 --> 00:54:41.678
DITCH ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD.

00:54:41.745 --> 00:54:43.713
AND THEY FOUND OUT THAT THE

00:54:43.780 --> 00:54:45.048
PERSON THAT THEY ARRESTED AND

00:54:45.115 --> 00:54:47.817
CHARGED WITH THAT CRIME HAD TWO

00:54:47.884 --> 00:54:49.319
YEARS EARLIER.

00:54:49.386 --> 00:54:50.787
AT COMMITTED AN ADDITIONAL RAPE

00:54:50.854 --> 00:54:52.222
WHERE THEY HAD A HIT.

00:54:52.288 --> 00:54:53.590
OUT OF THE SEXUAL ASSAULT KIT

00:54:53.657 --> 00:54:55.525
COMING FROM THAT RAPE AND THE

00:54:55.592 --> 00:54:56.893
DISTRICT ATTORNEY IN NORTH

00:54:56.960 --> 00:54:58.862
CAROLINA SAID IF THEY HAD

00:54:58.928 --> 00:55:00.363
FOLLOWED UP ON THAT HIT THAT

00:55:00.430 --> 00:55:01.831
LITTLE GIRL WOULD PROBABLY STILL

00:55:01.898 --> 00:55:02.799
BE ALIVE TODAY.

00:55:02.866 --> 00:55:05.402
THAT CAN NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN.

00:55:05.468 --> 00:55:07.904
BUT CALIFORNIA DOES NOT HAVE THE

00:55:07.971 --> 00:55:08.538
INFORMATION OR THE TOOLS RIGHT

00:55:08.605 --> 00:55:10.940
NOW TO IDENTIFY WHERE WE'RE AT

00:55:11.007 --> 00:55:11.841
RISK OF SOMETHING LIKE THAT

00:55:11.908 --> 00:55:13.643
HAPPENING WE WOULD NOT KNOW

00:55:13.710 --> 00:55:14.844
ABOUT WHAT WAS GOING ON IT

00:55:14.911 --> 00:55:15.945
FRESNO IF NOT FOR THAT GRANT

00:55:16.012 --> 00:55:17.347
PROGRAM IF WE HADN'T GONE DOWN

00:55:17.414 --> 00:55:18.615
THERE AND TALK TO THEM.

00:55:18.682 --> 00:55:20.350
BUT CASE OUTCOME INFORMATION CAN

00:55:20.417 --> 00:55:22.552
PROVIDE THAT TOOL. TO ALLOW US

00:55:22.619 --> 00:55:24.320
TO IDENTIFY THOSE ISSUES IT

00:55:24.387 --> 00:55:26.589
WOULD SHOW US WHERE WE HAVE.

00:55:26.656 --> 00:55:27.757
A BUNCH OF HITS THAT HAVE GONE

00:55:27.824 --> 00:55:29.993
ON INVESTIGATED IT WAS SHOW US

00:55:30.060 --> 00:55:31.127
WHERE THERE HAS BEEN AN

00:55:31.194 --> 00:55:32.662
INVESTIGATION BUT THERE'S BEEN

00:55:32.729 --> 00:55:33.797
NO ARRESTS MADE.

00:55:33.863 --> 00:55:35.165
IT WOULD SHOW US WHERE LAW

00:55:35.231 --> 00:55:36.733
ENFORCEMENT HAS SUBMITTED A

00:55:36.800 --> 00:55:37.467
BUNCH OF CASES THE DISTRICT

00:55:37.534 --> 00:55:38.768
ATTORNEY BUT THE DISTRICT

00:55:38.835 --> 00:55:40.370
ATTORNEY HAS NOT FILED ANY

00:55:40.437 --> 00:55:41.104
CHARGES.

00:55:41.171 --> 00:55:42.672
YOU WOULD BE A POWERFUL TOOL IN

00:55:42.739 --> 00:55:43.907
PROVIDING A LOT OF INFORMATION

00:55:43.973 --> 00:55:45.909
THAT WE COULD USE TO IDENTIFY

00:55:45.975 --> 00:55:47.677
AND REMOVE THE UNDERLYING

00:55:47.744 --> 00:55:49.212
BARRIERS THAT PREVENT SEXUAL

00:55:49.279 --> 00:55:50.714
ASSAULT CASES FOR BEING.

00:55:50.780 --> 00:55:52.015
EFFECTIVELY INVESTIGATED AND

00:55:52.082 --> 00:55:54.651
PROSECUTED AND FOR THAT REASON

00:55:54.718 --> 00:55:56.052
WE'RE RECOMMENDING THAT THE

00:55:56.119 --> 00:55:58.054
LEGISLATURE IF IT DOES REQUIRE

00:55:58.121 --> 00:56:00.123
THAT ALL SEXUAL ASSAULT EVIDENCE

00:56:00.190 --> 00:56:01.291
KITS IN THE STATE BE TESTED.

00:56:01.357 --> 00:56:03.293
THAT INCLUDE A REQUIREMENT THAT

00:56:03.359 --> 00:56:05.128
LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES REPORT

00:56:05.195 --> 00:56:07.130
CASE OUTCOME INFORMATION TO THE

00:56:07.197 --> 00:56:08.565
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE THAT

00:56:08.631 --> 00:56:10.433
ALREADY COLLECTS INFORMATION ON

00:56:10.500 --> 00:56:12.068
SEXUAL ASSAULT CASES.

00:56:12.135 --> 00:56:12.969
AND THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:56:13.036 --> 00:56:15.605
JUSTICE PUBLISHED SUMMARY

00:56:15.672 --> 00:56:18.208
INFORMATION -- ON THAT DATA.

00:56:18.274 --> 00:56:19.409
SO THAT'S THIS THAT'S OUR

00:56:19.476 --> 00:56:20.710
FINDINGS BUT IF YOU GUYS HAVE

00:56:20.777 --> 00:56:21.311
ANY QUESTIONS WE HAVE ANSWERED

00:56:21.377 --> 00:56:23.046
THEM.

00:56:23.113 --> 00:56:24.447
THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT

00:56:24.514 --> 00:56:25.682
APPRECIATE THE TESTIMONY AND YOU

00:56:25.749 --> 00:56:27.117
KNOW.

00:56:27.183 --> 00:56:28.718
THE WAY IT'S FRAME I THINK --

00:56:28.785 --> 00:56:30.553
JUST READING THE FACIAL

00:56:30.620 --> 00:56:31.521
EXPRESSIONS OF MY COLLEAGUES

00:56:31.588 --> 00:56:34.591
HERE -- YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE

00:56:34.657 --> 00:56:36.426
WONDERING.

00:56:36.493 --> 00:56:37.260
WELL MAYBE THIS WEBER AND

00:56:37.327 --> 00:56:38.328
SUBCOMMITTEE.

00:56:38.394 --> 00:56:40.096
WE CAN FIND OUT WHERE THE SEVEN

00:56:40.163 --> 00:56:42.198
POINT FIVE MILLION THAT WE

00:56:42.265 --> 00:56:44.234
ALLOCATED PREVIOUSLY -- HAS GONE

00:56:44.300 --> 00:56:46.336
IN.

00:56:46.402 --> 00:56:48.104
HI THIS BE UTILIZED.

00:56:48.171 --> 00:56:49.005
SINCE ARE STILL BEING OUT THERE

00:56:49.072 --> 00:56:51.608
SO QUESTIONS BUT LET ME JUST.

00:56:51.674 --> 00:56:54.077
ASK SO TALL CASE INFORMATION.

00:56:54.144 --> 00:56:55.779
THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT FOR THE

00:56:55.845 --> 00:56:57.080
FOR THE OUTCOMES AND THE

00:56:57.147 --> 00:56:58.681
METHODOLOGIES THAT YOU LOOKED AT

00:56:58.748 --> 00:57:00.283
BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT -- LAW

00:57:00.350 --> 00:57:02.085
ENFORCEMENT AGENTS IS AGENCIES

00:57:02.152 --> 00:57:03.520
WAS IS CONSISTENT ACROSS ALL OF

00:57:03.586 --> 00:57:05.054
THEM OR THEY ALL KIND OF

00:57:05.121 --> 00:57:09.492
DIFFERENT -- YEP STRIVE TO

00:57:09.559 --> 00:57:12.462
FIGURE OUT HOW SYSTEMIC THIS IS.

00:57:12.529 --> 00:57:13.930
GIVEN THAT WE DIDN'T -- GO

00:57:13.997 --> 00:57:15.498
THROUGH EVERY LAW ENFORCEMENT

00:57:15.565 --> 00:57:17.100
AGENCY TO ACTUALLY SEE WHICH

00:57:17.167 --> 00:57:18.301
ONES FOLLOW THROUGH WITH THE

00:57:18.368 --> 00:57:20.036
KIDS WHICH ONES DID NOT AND

00:57:20.103 --> 00:57:20.737
REASONS WHY.

00:57:20.804 --> 00:57:22.438
THEY GOT MISTERS TALKED ABOUT

00:57:22.505 --> 00:57:23.740
MAYBE SOME -- OR MAYBE IT WAS

00:57:23.807 --> 00:57:24.474
YOU.

00:57:24.541 --> 00:57:27.277
MISSPELLING ABOUT THE IMPLICIT

00:57:27.343 --> 00:57:28.411
BIASES AND THINGS LIKE THAT.

00:57:28.478 --> 00:57:29.512
SO WE DIDN'T LOOK INTO THE

00:57:29.579 --> 00:57:30.880
POTENTIAL THAT THERE WERE ANY

00:57:30.947 --> 00:57:32.348
IMPLICIT BIASES AT THE LAW

00:57:32.415 --> 00:57:33.883
ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES WE VISITED

00:57:33.950 --> 00:57:35.451
THAT WAS A LITTLE BIT OUTSIDE

00:57:35.518 --> 00:57:36.286
THE SCOPE OF WHAT WE WERE DOING

00:57:36.352 --> 00:57:36.953
THERE.

00:57:37.020 --> 00:57:38.454
WE REALLY WENT THERE TO SEE WHAT

00:57:38.521 --> 00:57:40.590
INFORMATION WAS AVAILABLE ONE OF

00:57:40.657 --> 00:57:41.724
THE REASONS THAT JUSTICE IT SAID

00:57:41.791 --> 00:57:43.493
THAT THERE MIGHT NOT BE CASE

00:57:43.560 --> 00:57:44.294
OUTCOME INFORMATION BEING

00:57:44.360 --> 00:57:45.161
REPORTED.

00:57:45.228 --> 00:57:47.096
WAS BECAUSE THOSE CASES HADN'T

00:57:47.163 --> 00:57:48.665
PROGRESSED FAR ENOUGH ALONG FOR

00:57:48.731 --> 00:57:49.933
THERE TO EVEN BE CASE OUTCOME

00:57:49.999 --> 00:57:51.167
INFORMATION.

00:57:51.234 --> 00:57:52.435
AND SO THAT'S WHY WE WENT DOWN

00:57:52.502 --> 00:57:53.369
TO THE THREE LAW ENFORCEMENT

00:57:53.436 --> 00:57:54.504
AGENCIES IS TO FIND OUT IS THAT

00:57:54.571 --> 00:57:55.839
TRUE DO THEY REALLY HAVE A

00:57:55.905 --> 00:57:57.073
REALLY NOT GOT ANY CASE THAT

00:57:57.140 --> 00:57:58.408
COMES TO PROVIDE.

00:57:58.474 --> 00:57:59.609
AND WE FOUND THAT THAT WASN'T

00:57:59.676 --> 00:58:01.244
TRUE MOST OF THE TIME ALMOST ALL

00:58:01.311 --> 00:58:02.846
OF THE CASES THEY HAD SOME CASE

00:58:02.912 --> 00:58:04.214
OUTCOME INFORMATION.

00:58:04.280 --> 00:58:05.114
SO THAT'S WHY WE WENT DOWN THERE

00:58:05.181 --> 00:58:06.316
WE DIDN'T EVALUATE THE

00:58:06.382 --> 00:58:07.483
REASONABLENESS OF THEIR

00:58:07.550 --> 00:58:09.452
DECISIONS TO HALT AN

00:58:09.519 --> 00:58:11.120
INVESTIGATION OR TO PUSH AN

00:58:11.187 --> 00:58:12.922
INVESTIGATION FORWARD.

00:58:12.989 --> 00:58:14.357
WHILE WE WERE THERE AND PLACE

00:58:14.424 --> 00:58:15.725
FOR THEM THE INPUT THAT

00:58:15.792 --> 00:58:18.628
INFORMATION WOULD THAT BE INTO

00:58:18.695 --> 00:58:20.230
THE RATS PROGRAM.

00:58:20.296 --> 00:58:22.031
YES YES SO THE DEPARTMENT

00:58:22.098 --> 00:58:23.166
JUSTICE IS TO ESTABLISH A

00:58:23.233 --> 00:58:24.334
DATABASE CALLED THE CHOP

00:58:24.400 --> 00:58:26.769
DATABASE -- THAT'S WHERE THEY

00:58:26.836 --> 00:58:28.071
HAVE ASKED LAW ENFORCEMENT

00:58:28.137 --> 00:58:30.206
AGENCIES TO REPORT THE CASE COME

00:58:30.273 --> 00:58:31.941
INFORMATION -- AS MISSPELLING

00:58:32.008 --> 00:58:33.276
COVERED THOUGH EARLIER WE FOUND

00:58:33.343 --> 00:58:34.444
THERE'S REALLY A LACK OF

00:58:34.510 --> 00:58:36.212
INFORMATION IN THAT DATABASE AND

00:58:36.279 --> 00:58:38.681
EVEN WHAT'S THERE IS -- NOT

00:58:38.748 --> 00:58:41.918
ALWAYS ACCURATE.

00:58:41.985 --> 00:58:43.953
OKAY YES MY COLLEAGUES IF THEY

00:58:44.020 --> 00:58:44.220
HAVE ANY.

00:58:44.287 --> 00:58:48.558
QUESTIONS.

00:58:48.625 --> 00:58:51.761
THIS WEBER PLACE CLEARLY -- I

00:58:51.828 --> 00:58:53.429
REMEMBER THE LEGISLATION THAT

00:58:53.496 --> 00:58:55.632
REQUIRED US TO HAVE ALL KIDS

00:58:55.698 --> 00:58:58.434
TESTED YOU KNOW AND I I I I FEEL

00:58:58.501 --> 00:58:59.135
LIKE I'M.

00:58:59.202 --> 00:59:00.904
DEAL WITH MY CHILDREN WHEN YOU

00:59:00.970 --> 00:59:02.171
TELL THEM TO DO ONE THING AND

00:59:02.238 --> 00:59:04.340
THEY DO THAT ONE THING.

00:59:04.407 --> 00:59:05.174
AND IN THE PROCESS SO WOULD TIM

00:59:05.241 --> 00:59:06.242
THINGS SHOULD BE DONE BEFORE

00:59:06.309 --> 00:59:07.443
THAT BUT THEY JUST DID THE ONE

00:59:07.510 --> 00:59:08.811
THAT I TOLD THEM.

00:59:08.878 --> 00:59:10.747
AND YOU JUST AS SOON WHEN YOU

00:59:10.813 --> 00:59:12.949
KNOW WHAT WORD ALSO MEANS A SO --

00:59:13.016 --> 00:59:16.419
IT IS IT IS AMAZING THAT WE ARE.

00:59:16.486 --> 00:59:18.388
AT THIS POINT AFTER THESE YEARS

00:59:18.454 --> 00:59:20.723
AT THAT THE LAST FIVE YEARS THAT

00:59:20.790 --> 00:59:22.425
TO WHERE WE WERE OUTRAGED ABOUT

00:59:22.492 --> 00:59:24.193
THE KIDS NOT BEING TESTED.

00:59:24.260 --> 00:59:24.761
BUT NOW WE'RE GETTING THEM

00:59:24.827 --> 00:59:25.628
TESTED BUT THAT WILL NOT

00:59:25.695 --> 00:59:27.163
FOLLOWING THROUGH WITH MUCH ELSE

00:59:27.230 --> 00:59:28.298
OTHER THAN THAT.

00:59:28.364 --> 00:59:30.934
OF ESPECIALLY IF WE THINK ABOUT

00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:32.468
AND NOT ONLY FINDING THE

00:59:32.535 --> 00:59:33.803
PERPETRATORS WHO DONE SOME

00:59:33.870 --> 00:59:35.371
CRIMES BUT POSSIBLY EVEN HAVING

00:59:35.438 --> 00:59:40.510
PEOPLE THAT WE'VE CONVICTED.

00:59:40.576 --> 00:59:41.044
THAT SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN

00:59:41.110 --> 00:59:42.445
CONVICTED IN A LAB THE HORROR OF

00:59:42.512 --> 00:59:44.180
THAT ALONE IS A PERSON BEING

00:59:44.247 --> 00:59:46.249
ACCUSED OF SOMETHING AND HAVING

00:59:46.316 --> 00:59:48.351
THEIR LIVES COMPLETELY DISRUPTED.

00:59:48.418 --> 00:59:49.986
FOR FOR YEARS ONLY TO DISCOVER

00:59:50.053 --> 00:59:51.955
THAT THERE'S DNA THAT COULD HAVE

00:59:52.021 --> 00:59:53.189
SAID THIS PERSON DID NOT DO IT.

00:59:53.256 --> 00:59:56.759
THAT IS MOST ALARMING TO ME --

00:59:56.826 --> 00:59:58.828
AND SO I'D -- I THINK WE'VE

00:59:58.895 --> 01:00:00.863
TAKEN THE CHARGE MY STAFF IS

01:00:00.930 --> 01:00:02.699
HERE -- WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO

01:00:02.765 --> 01:00:03.900
OBVIOUSLY DO SOMETHING IN THE

01:00:03.967 --> 01:00:04.901
BUDGET WITH THE MONEY THAT WE'VE

01:00:04.968 --> 01:00:06.336
GIVEN THEM PUT SOME STIPULATIONS

01:00:06.402 --> 01:00:07.070
ON IT.

01:00:07.136 --> 01:00:09.472
WITH REGARDS TO REPORTING AND

01:00:09.539 --> 01:00:10.807
AND GETTING INFORMATION BACK TO

01:00:10.873 --> 01:00:12.308
US BUT IT'S JUST UNFORTUNATE

01:00:12.375 --> 01:00:14.877
THAT WE HAVE ALL OF THESE THINGS

01:00:14.944 --> 01:00:16.379
AVAILABLE AND WE DON'T HAVE SEEN

01:00:16.446 --> 01:00:17.647
THE ENERGY OR THE DESIRE AS YOU

01:00:17.714 --> 01:00:19.115
POINTED OUT.

01:00:19.182 --> 01:00:20.616
THE LACK OF THE LACK LUSTER

01:00:20.683 --> 01:00:22.719
METHOD IN WHICH WE JUST KINDA OF

01:00:22.785 --> 01:00:25.188
TAKE THE INFORMATION AND NOT

01:00:25.254 --> 01:00:25.822
FOLLOW THROUGH WITH IT WHEN WE

01:00:25.888 --> 01:00:27.323
HAVE THE POTENTIAL. TO DO AN

01:00:27.390 --> 01:00:28.391
AWFUL LOT OF THINGS AND TO

01:00:28.458 --> 01:00:30.460
PREVENT SOME CRIMES TO AS WELL

01:00:30.526 --> 01:00:33.863
SO I I IT IS VERY ALARMING --

01:00:33.930 --> 01:00:35.031
GIVEN THE AMOUNT OF MONEY WE PUT

01:00:35.098 --> 01:00:36.466
INTO THIS PROJECT TO TO GET

01:00:36.532 --> 01:00:38.434
THESE KIDS TESTED TO DISCOVER

01:00:38.501 --> 01:00:39.135
THAT.

01:00:39.202 --> 01:00:40.303
THERE'S VERY LITTLE HAPPENING

01:00:40.370 --> 01:00:42.705
WITH ME AFTERWARDS VERY ALARMING

01:00:42.772 --> 01:00:47.110
BUT THANK YOU FOR YOUR

01:00:47.176 --> 01:00:47.443
THOROUGHNESS.

01:00:47.510 --> 01:00:49.812
YEAH.

01:00:49.879 --> 01:00:51.714
GIVE SOMEONE NUMBER LACKEY.

01:00:51.781 --> 01:00:52.515
THE MOST ALARMING THING TO ME IS

01:00:52.582 --> 01:00:53.549
NOT THE MONEY SPENT BUT IT'S

01:00:53.616 --> 01:00:55.084
IT'S THE THE IMPACT ON PEOPLE'S

01:00:55.151 --> 01:00:55.918
LIVES I MEAN AS YOU TALK.

01:00:55.985 --> 01:00:56.819
ABOUT THE TRAGEDY WITH THAT

01:00:56.886 --> 01:00:58.654
YOUNG LADY THE VERY NATURE OF

01:00:58.721 --> 01:01:00.023
THIS CRIME IS THAT IT.

01:01:00.089 --> 01:01:01.257
THE PERPETUATES.

01:01:01.324 --> 01:01:03.693
I CONTINUES AND SO THAT'S THE

01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:06.195
URGENCY THAT ALL AGENCIES

01:01:06.262 --> 01:01:07.397
INVOLVED SHOULD BE.

01:01:07.463 --> 01:01:09.899
ENGAGED IN AT AND THEY SHOULD.

01:01:09.966 --> 01:01:11.701
CERTAINLY HAVE A GRASP ON I

01:01:11.768 --> 01:01:12.602
DON'T.

01:01:12.668 --> 01:01:14.737
HAVE ANY UNDERSTANDING HOW THIS

01:01:14.804 --> 01:01:16.973
COULD BE SO DRASTICALLY --

01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:19.409
ALARMING IT REALLY IS.

01:01:19.475 --> 01:01:20.743
THIS IS A HUGE PRIORITY IN MY

01:01:20.810 --> 01:01:21.811
MIND THAT THAT SHOULD BE

01:01:21.878 --> 01:01:22.945
FOLLOWED UP ON AND THE

01:01:23.012 --> 01:01:23.846
COORDINATION IS WHERE THE

01:01:23.913 --> 01:01:25.381
PROBLEM IS.

01:01:25.448 --> 01:01:26.916
I MEAN YOU HAVE PEOPLE DOING

01:01:26.983 --> 01:01:28.117
WHAT THEY THINK THEY'RE REQUIRED

01:01:28.184 --> 01:01:29.585
TO DO.

01:01:29.652 --> 01:01:30.887
AND BEYOND THAT THERE DOESN'T

01:01:30.953 --> 01:01:32.655
SEEM TO BE MUCH COORDINATION

01:01:32.722 --> 01:01:34.490
GOING INVOLVED -- THEY'RE JUST

01:01:34.557 --> 01:01:36.426
ASSUMING AND THERE'S A LOT OF

01:01:36.492 --> 01:01:39.162
ASSUMPTION AS INDICATED THAT'S A

01:01:39.228 --> 01:01:42.498
TERRIBLE THING TO DO -- I JUST

01:01:42.565 --> 01:01:44.667
HOPE THAT WE ACT NOW NOW THAT WE

01:01:44.734 --> 01:01:46.669
HAVE THIS DADDO WE WE NEED IT'S

01:01:46.736 --> 01:01:48.337
UP TO US TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

01:01:48.404 --> 01:01:49.238
OVERSEE BECAUSE THAT'S ONE OF

01:01:49.305 --> 01:01:50.873
OUR JOBS IS TO OVERSEE AND MAKE

01:01:50.940 --> 01:01:52.241
SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE.

01:01:52.308 --> 01:01:54.844
DOING WHAT IS EXPECTED AND

01:01:54.911 --> 01:01:56.779
FORTUNE UNFORTUNATELY I THINK

01:01:56.846 --> 01:01:59.215
THERE'S A BIG GAP AND WHAT'S

01:01:59.282 --> 01:02:00.316
BEING ACCOMPLISHED WHAT SHOULD

01:02:00.383 --> 01:02:01.751
BE ACCOMPLISHED AS IT.

01:02:01.818 --> 01:02:03.653
RELATES THIS IS EVIDENCE THAT WE

01:02:03.719 --> 01:02:06.389
HAVE RIGHT THIS IS EVIDENCE --

01:02:06.456 --> 01:02:08.491
IT'S NOT JUST.

01:02:08.558 --> 01:02:10.193
NEBULOUS INFORMATION THIS IS

01:02:10.259 --> 01:02:11.761
VERY VERY TARGETED.

01:02:11.828 --> 01:02:14.297
AND SO WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY

01:02:14.363 --> 01:02:16.199
TO REALLY USE THAT INFORMATION.

01:02:16.265 --> 01:02:17.467
TO MAKE GOOD OUTCOMES AND TO

01:02:17.533 --> 01:02:19.368
PREVENT TRAGEDY THAT'S THE HOPE

01:02:19.435 --> 01:02:21.804
IS PREVENTION NOT NECESSARILY

01:02:21.871 --> 01:02:22.138
JUST.

01:02:22.205 --> 01:02:24.540
MEETING OUT PUNISHMENT BUT

01:02:24.607 --> 01:02:27.143
PREVENTING MORE VICTIMS THAT'S

01:02:27.210 --> 01:02:28.311
WHAT I HOPE.

01:02:28.377 --> 01:02:29.879
WE CAN ACCOMPLISH BY USING THIS

01:02:29.946 --> 01:02:32.682
DATA BECAUSE STATUS WHAT'S MOST

01:02:32.748 --> 01:02:33.316

01:06:10.766 --> 01:06:12.401
IT SERVES AS AN AUTOMATED SYSTEM

01:06:12.468 --> 01:06:13.769
FOR TRACKING THE HISTORY OF

TRACKING AND COMMUNICATION.

01:06:40.930 --> 01:06:42.398
THE RAPID DNA SERVICE STARTED AS

01:06:42.465 --> 01:06:44.333
A PILOT PROGRAM IN TWO THOUSAND

01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:45.301
ELEVEN TO BETTER SERVE VICTIMS

SEXUAL ASSAULT CASES THE RATS

01:06:51.874 --> 01:06:53.442

RECEIVE AN ANALYZE THE MOST

01:06:54.844 --> 01:06:56.579
PROBATIVE SAMPLES IN SEXUAL

01:06:56.645 --> 01:06:57.680
ASSAULT CASES.

01:06:57.747 --> 01:06:59.415
IT WAS A NOVEL APPROACH AS IT

01:06:59.482 --> 01:07:00.483
ALLOWED THE MEDICAL STAFF TO

01:07:00.549 --> 01:07:01.784
SUBMIT THE EVIDENCE DIRECTLY TO

01:07:01.851 --> 01:07:03.552
THE LABORATORY WITHOUT FIRST

01:07:07.056 --> 01:07:08.457
THE APPROACH NOT ONLY LEAD TO AN

01:07:08.524 --> 01:07:09.692
INCREASE IN THE EFFICIENCY OF

01:07:09.759 --> 01:07:10.960
EVIDENCE PROCESSING BUT ALSO

01:07:11.026 --> 01:07:13.462
DEMONSTRATED -- RELATIVELY THE

01:07:13.529 --> 01:07:14.864
SAME WHAT WE WOULD CALL HIT RATE.

01:07:14.930 --> 01:07:17.600

UNDERSTANDING THAT WE HAD

01:07:59.341 --> 01:08:01.410
DEVELOPED FOR THESE COUNTIES TO

01:08:01.477 --> 01:08:02.711
CLEARLY OUTLINE THE EXPECTATION

01:08:02.778 --> 01:08:04.747
THAT PARTICIPANTS USE AN UPDATE

01:08:04.814 --> 01:08:06.348
CHOP.

01:08:06.415 --> 01:08:07.249
SOME OF THE USER MODIFIED WITH

01:08:07.316 --> 01:08:08.651
THE CORRECT LANGUAGE NOT ALL

01:08:08.717 --> 01:08:09.752
WERE MODIFIED DUE TO THE RAPID

01:08:09.819 --> 01:08:12.354
EXPANSION THAT OCCURRED BETWEEN

01:08:12.421 --> 01:08:13.122
TWENTY FOURTEEN AND TWENTY

01:08:13.189 --> 01:08:14.824
EIGHTEEN THE PROGRAM EXPANDED TO

01:08:14.890 --> 01:08:15.691
THIRTY NINE COUNTIES.

01:08:15.758 --> 01:08:17.393
OUT OF THE FORTY SIX COUNTIES

01:08:17.460 --> 01:08:19.195
THAT WE SERVE.

01:08:19.261 --> 01:08:21.430
CALIFORNIA COUNTIES THAT DO NOT

01:08:21.497 --> 01:08:23.098
HAVE THEIR OWN -- SORRY THAT

01:08:23.165 --> 01:08:24.300
DON'T HAVE THEIR OWN LABS THOSE

01:08:24.366 --> 01:08:25.568
ARE THE AREAS WE SERVE THEY

01:08:25.634 --> 01:08:26.735
DON'T HAVE THEIR OWN LAPS.

01:08:26.802 --> 01:08:28.304
SEVERAL USE WERE NOT CREATED OR

SIGN FOR NEW COUNTIES ENTERED

01:08:29.872 --> 01:08:32.274
THE PROGRAM -- WELL SOME OF THIS

01:08:32.341 --> 01:08:33.242
MAY HAVE BEEN IMPROVED OF BETTER

01:08:33.309 --> 01:08:34.610
RESOURCES TO MAINTAIN THE

COMMUNICATION FOR THIS NON

01:08:37.079 --> 01:08:38.747
MANDATED PROGRAM IT IS APPARENT

01:08:38.814 --> 01:08:40.316
THAT WITHOUT A CLEAR LEGISLATIVE

01:08:40.382 --> 01:08:41.183
MANDATE IN PLACE.

01:08:41.250 --> 01:08:43.252
BFS WILL BE VERY POORLY POSITION

01:08:43.319 --> 01:08:44.787
TO GET A 100% OF THE AMMO YOU

01:08:44.854 --> 01:08:48.057
SIGNED TO PROPERLY ENFORCE.

01:08:48.123 --> 01:08:50.226
OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS SINCE

01:08:50.292 --> 01:08:51.994
THE FIRST CALIFORNIA STATE ON A

REPORT WAS ISSUED.

01:08:53.462 --> 01:08:54.597
BFS IS EXPERIENCED SOME VERY

01:08:54.663 --> 01:08:56.265
CRITICAL DEFINITE DEFICITS IN

01:08:56.332 --> 01:08:58.100
OUR PRIMARY REVENUE FUND AND

01:08:58.167 --> 01:08:59.869
THAT'S THE THE ANY ID FUND THE

01:08:59.935 --> 01:09:02.304
FUND DECREASED BY 12%.

01:09:02.371 --> 01:09:03.839

FOURTEEN FIFTEEN AND FIFTEEN

01:09:06.008 --> 01:09:08.477

THE END OF FISCAL YEAR.

01:09:10.746 --> 01:09:11.313
SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN AS A RESULT

01:09:11.380 --> 01:09:12.248
OF YOUR WAS ALSO FORCED TO

RELEASE A NUMBER OF VACANCIES

01:09:14.016 --> 01:09:16.619
THAT WE COULDN'T SUSTAIN.

01:09:16.685 --> 01:09:17.486
THE VARIOUS REVIEWS OF THE

01:09:17.553 --> 01:09:18.621
PROGRAM WERE CONDUCTED BY

01:09:18.687 --> 01:09:19.788
PREVIOUS MANAGEMENT PRIOR TO THE

01:09:19.855 --> 01:09:21.357
FOLLOW UP OUT OF THERE WAS A

01:09:21.423 --> 01:09:21.891
HIGH TURNOVER OF STAFF AND

01:09:21.957 --> 01:09:23.292
LEADERSHIP.

01:09:23.359 --> 01:09:24.693
AND WHILE THE SCIENTIFIC

ANALYSIS AND REPORTING SIDE OF

01:09:26.996 --> 01:09:28.597
THIS PROGRAM IS STILL VERY

01:09:28.664 --> 01:09:30.199
SUCCESSFUL.

01:09:30.266 --> 01:09:32.034
THE NON MANDATED CHOP OUTCOME

01:09:32.101 --> 01:09:33.335
REPORTING WAS UNDENIABLY NEED

01:09:33.402 --> 01:09:34.637
IMPROVEMENTS INCLUDING A

01:09:34.703 --> 01:09:36.272
LEGISLATIVE REQUIREMENT TO

REPORT OUTCOMES IN CHOP.

01:09:39.241 --> 01:09:41.243
INITIAL OUT REACH. FOR THE RATS

01:09:41.310 --> 01:09:43.112
PROGRAM WAS VERY ACTIVE AS WE

01:09:43.178 --> 01:09:45.080
WERE ONLY DEALING WITH THOSE FEW

01:09:45.147 --> 01:09:46.315
INITIAL COUNTIES.

01:09:46.382 --> 01:09:47.416
BUT THE PROGRAM AS I STATED

01:09:47.483 --> 01:09:49.118
BEFORE GREW RAPIDLY WITH THAT

01:09:49.184 --> 01:09:50.452
ADDITIONAL THIRTY TWO COUNTIES

SAME PACE.

01:10:01.096 --> 01:10:02.197
THERE WAS AN ATTEMPT BY THE

01:10:07.403 --> 01:10:08.103
SENATE APPROPRIATIONS.

01:10:08.170 --> 01:10:10.105
ABSENT LEGISLATION MANDATING THE

AT CETERA WILL BE EXTREMELY

01:10:24.687 --> 01:10:26.221
DIFFICULT AND AS A RESULT BE

01:10:26.288 --> 01:10:28.324
INSUFFICIENT.

01:10:28.390 --> 01:10:29.391
WHAT THE LEGISLATURE AND

CONTINUES TO REMAIN VOLATILE AND

01:10:41.203 --> 01:10:42.404
THERE'S LITTLE OPPORTUNITY TO

GOVERNOR NEWSOME'S OFFICE.

01:11:02.124 --> 01:11:02.658
I CAN TALK FOR A SECOND ABOUT

01:11:02.725 --> 01:11:04.994

PURSUANT TO THE AUDIT WAS

01:14:16.652 --> 01:14:17.786

01:14:18.720 --> 01:14:21.390
REQUIRING CHOP PARTICIPATION FOR

01:14:21.456 --> 01:14:22.357
AGENCIES USING THE RATS PROGRAM

01:14:22.424 --> 01:14:22.658
[inaudible]

01:14:22.724 --> 01:14:24.660
UNFORTUNATELY.

01:14:24.726 --> 01:14:25.627
THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

01:14:25.694 --> 01:14:26.595
DOESN'T HAVE AN ENFORCEMENT

01:14:26.662 --> 01:14:28.564
MECHANISM IF SOMEBODY VIOLATES

01:14:28.630 --> 01:14:30.766
AN AMMO YOU.

01:14:30.833 --> 01:14:32.901
WE CAN ASK AGAIN BUT WE CAN'T

01:14:32.968 --> 01:14:34.369
ENFORCE THE MEMORANDUM OF

01:14:34.436 --> 01:14:36.905

01:14:36.972 --> 01:14:38.540
SEC DOING THINGS LIKE NOT

PROCESSING PROCESSING THEIR

01:14:39.708 --> 01:14:41.710
CASES IN ENFORCEMENT IS NOT

01:14:41.777 --> 01:14:43.445
REALLY SOMETHING THAT WE WANT TO

01:14:43.512 --> 01:14:44.346
DO BECAUSE THAT DOESN'T HELP

01:14:44.413 --> 01:14:45.614
VICTIMS IT DOESN'T HELP THE

01:14:45.681 --> 01:14:47.749
PUBLIC AND SO WE CONTINUE TO

01:14:47.816 --> 01:14:49.084
TAKE THEIR CASES REGARDLESS OF

01:14:49.151 --> 01:14:51.286

01:14:51.353 --> 01:14:51.753

01:14:55.190 --> 01:14:56.091
FOURTEEN WE HAVE REPORTED TO THE

01:14:56.158 --> 01:14:57.359
LEGISLATURE THAT OBTAINING CASE

01:14:57.426 --> 01:14:58.493
OUTCOMES IS AN UP HILL BATTLE

01:14:58.560 --> 01:14:59.928
BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF A

01:14:59.995 --> 01:15:00.762
STATUTORY MANDATE TO COLLECT

01:15:00.829 --> 01:15:01.597
THEM.

01:15:01.663 --> 01:15:02.965

01:15:03.031 --> 01:15:04.733
MANDATED ENTRY INTO A DATABASE

01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:06.768
USING SAFETY AS A PROXY.

01:15:06.835 --> 01:15:07.336
IS MAKING A DIFFERENCE IN

01:15:07.402 --> 01:15:09.671
COMPLIANCE AFTER ONLY ONE YEAR

01:15:09.738 --> 01:15:11.473
WE ARE SEEING A HIGH PERCENTAGE

01:15:11.540 --> 01:15:13.108
OF COMPLIANCE FOR THE CASES THAT

01:15:13.175 --> 01:15:15.410
ARE ENTERED INTO SAFETY WITH A

TO VICTIMS OF INTERPERSONAL

01:17:09.191 --> 01:17:10.792
VIOLENCE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

01:17:10.859 --> 01:17:13.128
SEXUAL ASSAULT.

01:17:13.195 --> 01:17:16.631
IN IN TWO THOUSAND AND TEN I HAD

01:17:16.698 --> 01:17:18.600
A CALL FROM SOMEONE FROM SANTA

01:17:18.667 --> 01:17:20.035
CRUZ WHO HAD A INDICATED THAT

01:17:20.102 --> 01:17:21.236
HER KID HAD BEEN.

01:17:21.303 --> 01:17:22.504
SITTING ON A SHELF IN THE POLICE

01:17:22.571 --> 01:17:24.773
DEPARTMENT SHERIFF DEPARTMENT

01:17:24.840 --> 01:17:25.374
FOR SEVEN MONTHS AND HOW RATE

01:17:25.440 --> 01:17:26.108
JUST THAT WAS.

01:17:26.174 --> 01:17:28.877
THAT PROMPTED ME TO START A

01:17:28.944 --> 01:17:30.078
PROJECT IN MY OWN COUNTY.

01:17:30.145 --> 01:17:31.646
BUT BEFORE I STARTED THE PROJECT

01:17:31.713 --> 01:17:32.514
IN MY COUNTY WENT TO NEW YORK

01:17:32.581 --> 01:17:34.216
CITY TO SEE WHAT THEY DID

01:17:34.282 --> 01:17:35.751
BECAUSE THEY HAD TEN THOUSAND

01:17:35.817 --> 01:17:36.885
UNTESTED KIDS.

01:17:36.952 --> 01:17:38.253
AND THEY WERE MANAGING HOW THEY

01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:40.589
WERE GOING TO TEST THOSE KIDS.

01:17:40.655 --> 01:17:42.257
IN ADDITION TO TRYING TO

01:17:42.324 --> 01:17:43.392
IDENTIFY PEOPLE WOULD BEEN

01:17:43.458 --> 01:17:45.594
KILLED IN NINE ELEVEN THE NINE

01:17:45.660 --> 01:17:46.661
ELEVEN ATTACK SO THAT A LOT OF

01:17:46.728 --> 01:17:48.096
WORK THEY WERE DOING AND YET

01:17:48.163 --> 01:17:49.564
THEY WERE MANAGING.

01:17:49.631 --> 01:17:51.166
TO ELIMINATE THE BACKLOG AND

01:17:51.233 --> 01:17:52.734
KEEP UP WITH THEIR CURRENT WORK.

01:17:52.801 --> 01:17:54.469
SO I WANTED TO KNOW WHAT IT WAS

01:17:54.536 --> 01:17:55.070
THAT THEY WERE DOING THAT WAS

01:17:55.137 --> 01:17:56.138
RIGHT.

01:17:56.204 --> 01:17:58.240
AND I CAME BACK AND I CAST TO

01:17:58.306 --> 01:17:59.608
PROSECUTORS IN MY OFFICE TO WORK

01:17:59.674 --> 01:18:00.842
WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT.

01:18:00.909 --> 01:18:02.244
AND I WANT TO MAKE THE POINT

01:18:02.310 --> 01:18:03.011
THAT I DO BELIEVE THE

01:18:03.078 --> 01:18:04.546
PROSECUTORS THE DA THE ELECTED

01:18:04.613 --> 01:18:06.214
DA HAS AN IMPORTANT ROLE.

01:18:06.281 --> 01:18:07.482
IN THEIR COUNTIES EACH OF OUR

01:18:07.549 --> 01:18:09.518
COUNTIES TO WORK WITH OUR LOCAL

01:18:09.584 --> 01:18:11.186
LAW ENFORCEMENT PARTICULARLY IN

01:18:11.253 --> 01:18:12.287
MANY OF THE COUNTIES WHERE THERE

01:18:12.354 --> 01:18:14.089
LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY IS REALLY

01:18:14.156 --> 01:18:15.824
THE SHERIFF'SDEPARTMENT.

01:18:15.891 --> 01:18:16.425
BECAUSE OF THE SIZE OF THEIR

01:18:16.491 --> 01:18:18.260
COUNTY SO I DO THINK THAT THE DA

01:18:18.326 --> 01:18:20.996
HAS AN IMPORTANT ROLE TO PLAY.

01:18:21.063 --> 01:18:22.731
AND THE TWO STAFF MY TWO

01:18:22.798 --> 01:18:24.299
ATTORNEYS WORKED WITH EVERYONE

01:18:24.366 --> 01:18:26.501
OF OUR POLICE AGENCIES TO

01:18:26.568 --> 01:18:28.670
IDENTIFY HOW MANY UNTESTED KIDS

01:18:28.737 --> 01:18:30.038
THEY HAD IN THEIR PROPERTY ROOM.

01:18:30.105 --> 01:18:31.773
IT TOOK US ABOUT A YEAR AND I

01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:33.175
WILL SAY THAT THE CITY OF

01:18:33.241 --> 01:18:34.342
OAKLAND WHO WAS PART OF THE

01:18:34.409 --> 01:18:37.946
ORIGINAL AUDIT.

01:18:38.013 --> 01:18:39.714
WAS THE MOST -- RESISTANT TO OUR

01:18:39.781 --> 01:18:41.216
EFFORTS AND EVENTUALLY IT BECAME

01:18:41.283 --> 01:18:42.417
MORE A POLITICAL ISSUE.

01:18:42.484 --> 01:18:43.819
WHERE THE MAYOR GOT INVOLVED THE

01:18:43.885 --> 01:18:45.954
CITY MANAGER GOT INVOLVED AND

01:18:46.021 --> 01:18:47.222
THEY ORDERED THE CRIME LAB

01:18:47.289 --> 01:18:48.824
DIRECTOR TO PARTICIPATE IN OUR

01:18:48.890 --> 01:18:49.658
PROGRAM?

01:18:49.724 --> 01:18:50.826
WHICH THEY EVENTUALLY DID AND

01:18:50.892 --> 01:18:52.127
WHAT WE DISCOVERED WAS A HAD

01:18:52.194 --> 01:18:54.329
ALMOST NINE HUNDRED UNTESTED

01:18:54.396 --> 01:18:55.564
KIDS.

01:18:55.630 --> 01:18:57.766
AND THEIR CRIME LAB IS IN THE

01:18:57.833 --> 01:18:58.366
SAME BUILDING AS OUR EVIDENCE

01:18:58.433 --> 01:18:59.067
ROOM.

01:18:59.134 --> 01:19:01.803
SO FOR ME -- YOU KNOW I CONTAIN

01:19:01.870 --> 01:19:03.438
MY OUTRAGE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

01:19:03.505 --> 01:19:04.606
MOVED FORWARD AND WORK

01:19:04.673 --> 01:19:06.575
COLLABORATIVELY -- AND WE

01:19:06.641 --> 01:19:08.944
STARTED THE EFFORT. TO START

01:19:09.010 --> 01:19:10.745
IDENTIFYING THIS KITCHEN FIGURE

01:19:10.812 --> 01:19:11.413
AND HOW WE'RE GOING TO TAKE CARE

01:19:11.480 --> 01:19:13.115
OF IT.

01:19:13.181 --> 01:19:15.117
I FOUND MONEY THROUGH -- FOR

01:19:15.183 --> 01:19:16.451
FUTURE UNRESTRICTED FOR FUTURE

01:19:16.518 --> 01:19:18.386
DOLLARS AND I PAID FOR THE FIRST

01:19:18.453 --> 01:19:20.222
ROUND OF TESING WE DID NOT GO

01:19:20.288 --> 01:19:22.224
THROUGH OUR GOVERNMENT CRIME LAB.

01:19:22.290 --> 01:19:23.792
THEY WERE FRANKLY TOO SLOW.

01:19:23.859 --> 01:19:25.427
AND THEY WOULD TAKE SIX MONTHS

01:19:25.494 --> 01:19:26.094
AND THEY WERE CHARGING LAW

01:19:26.161 --> 01:19:26.895
ENFORCEMENT.

01:19:26.962 --> 01:19:28.763
MORE MONEY THAN MANY OF THE

01:19:28.830 --> 01:19:30.432
AGENCIES HAD.

01:19:30.499 --> 01:19:32.434
SO WE GOT IN TOUCH WITH THE

01:19:32.501 --> 01:19:33.335
COMPANY WE MET HIM THROUGH

01:19:33.401 --> 01:19:34.803
NATASHA YOU'RE GONNA MEET IN A

01:19:34.870 --> 01:19:36.304
FEW MINUTES. TO THE NATASHA

01:19:36.371 --> 01:19:38.340
PROJECT BODHI LAB IN VIRGINIA

01:19:38.406 --> 01:19:40.075
AND WE CONTRACT WITH THEM AND

01:19:40.142 --> 01:19:42.677
THEY DID THEY HAVE DONE ALL OF

01:19:42.744 --> 01:19:43.645
OUR BACKLOG TESTING.

01:19:43.712 --> 01:19:45.347
THE FIRST GROUP WE SENT THEM ONE

01:19:45.413 --> 01:19:46.982
HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN KIDS.

01:19:47.048 --> 01:19:48.850
AND IN ONE MONTH'S TIME THEY HAD

01:19:48.917 --> 01:19:50.952
COMPLETED THEIR REVIEW OF THOSE

01:19:51.019 --> 01:19:51.586
HUNDRED SIXTEEN THE TESTING WE

01:19:51.653 --> 01:19:53.021
HAD FIFTY ONE PROFILES

01:19:53.088 --> 01:19:54.856
IDENTIFIED AND ADDED THAT IN THE

01:19:54.923 --> 01:19:56.258
FIRST WEEKEND THAT IT WAS IN

01:19:56.324 --> 01:19:57.025
CODIS.

01:19:57.092 --> 01:20:00.729
WHICH ALSO FEEDS INTO THE BIG

01:20:00.795 --> 01:20:03.665
STATE DOT DOJ -- DATABASE FEEDS

01:20:03.732 --> 01:20:05.667
INTO THE NATIONAL IN THAT FIRST

01:20:05.734 --> 01:20:07.469
WEEK IN MAY TWENTY SEVEN HITS ON

01:20:07.536 --> 01:20:09.504
THE FIFTY ONE PROFILES THAT WE

01:20:09.571 --> 01:20:10.272
SUBMITTED.

01:20:10.338 --> 01:20:12.174
SO WE KNOW THE SIGNIFICANCE THAT

01:20:12.240 --> 01:20:14.209
DISPLAYS IN BEING ABLE TO

01:20:14.276 --> 01:20:16.278
IDENTIFY PERPETRATORS. TO

01:20:16.344 --> 01:20:18.446
IDENTIFY SERIAL RAPIST AND MARK

01:20:18.513 --> 01:20:20.515
AS IMPORTANTLY WHAT ASSEMBLY

01:20:20.582 --> 01:20:21.283
MEMBER WEBER POINTED OUT TO

01:20:21.349 --> 01:20:23.318
EXONERATE PEOPLE WHO WERE

01:20:23.385 --> 01:20:24.152
IDENTIFIED BY.

01:20:24.219 --> 01:20:25.887
THE THROUGH THE EYE WITNESS

01:20:25.954 --> 01:20:27.489
TESTIMONY WHICH TURNED OUT TO BE

01:20:27.556 --> 01:20:28.723
FLOOD.

01:20:28.790 --> 01:20:30.125
OR PEOPLE THAT WERE CHARGED THAT

01:20:30.192 --> 01:20:31.393
HAD NOT ACTUALLY COMMITTED THE

01:20:31.459 --> 01:20:33.562
CRIME.

01:20:33.628 --> 01:20:36.164
SINCE THAT TIME -- WE WE CREATED

01:20:36.231 --> 01:20:38.166
AN ENTIRE -- INITIATIVE CALLED

01:20:38.233 --> 01:20:39.768
ELIMINATE THE BACKLOG.

01:20:39.834 --> 01:20:41.269
WE SHARE THIS AROUND THE STATE

01:20:41.336 --> 01:20:42.971
AROUND THE COUNTRY AND IT HAD

01:20:43.038 --> 01:20:44.606
SEVERAL COMPONENTS NOT JUST

01:20:44.673 --> 01:20:46.174
ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO GET

01:20:46.241 --> 01:20:48.076
THESE TO THESE KIDS TESTED IN A

01:20:48.143 --> 01:20:49.311
TIMELY MANNER.

01:20:49.377 --> 01:20:50.779
BUT ONE OF THE OTHER BACKLOGS

01:20:50.845 --> 01:20:53.281
THAT EXIST IS THAT WHEN A

01:20:53.348 --> 01:20:55.450
PRIVATE LAB -- WHICH FOR US WAS

01:20:55.517 --> 01:20:57.452
BODHI WHICH WAS PROCESSING A

01:20:57.519 --> 01:20:59.054
HUNDRED KIDS A MONTH FOR US --

01:20:59.120 --> 01:21:01.022
THAT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN WITH THAT

01:21:01.089 --> 01:21:02.824
BEFORE THE DNA PROFILE COULD GO

01:21:02.891 --> 01:21:04.259
INTO THE DATABASE.

01:21:04.326 --> 01:21:05.927
SOMEONE FROM A GOVERNMENT CRIME

01:21:05.994 --> 01:21:06.494
LET WOULD HAVE TO REVIEW THE

01:21:06.561 --> 01:21:07.295
REPORT.

01:21:07.362 --> 01:21:09.097
NOW I KNOW A LOT ABOUT THIS AND

01:21:09.164 --> 01:21:10.799
I READ A LOT OF THESE REPORTS

01:21:10.865 --> 01:21:12.500
AND THEY'RE PRETTY MUCH THE SAME

01:21:12.567 --> 01:21:13.568
REPORT WITH THE BOTTOM LINE

01:21:13.635 --> 01:21:14.703
BEING DIFFERENT WHICH WHOEVER

01:21:14.769 --> 01:21:15.837
THE PROFILE IS.

01:21:15.904 --> 01:21:17.405
BUT IN THE HOUSTON WHEN I WENT

01:21:17.472 --> 01:21:18.573
AND VISITED THEIR LAB IT WAS

01:21:18.640 --> 01:21:20.275
TAKING THEM THREE YEARS JUST TO

01:21:20.342 --> 01:21:21.576
REVIEW THE REPORTS.

01:21:21.643 --> 01:21:23.011
SO THERE WAS NOT ONLY A BACKLOG

01:21:23.078 --> 01:21:24.312
OF KIDS NOT BEINGTESTED BUT

01:21:24.379 --> 01:21:26.314
THEN THREE YEARS TO GET THROUGH

01:21:26.381 --> 01:21:27.182
ALL THE REPORTS.

01:21:27.249 --> 01:21:29.150
AND WE WE HAVE RECEIVED SPECIAL

01:21:29.217 --> 01:21:30.752
FUNDING WE DID RECEIVE.

01:21:30.819 --> 01:21:32.821
A SPECIAL FUNDING TO PAY FOR

01:21:32.887 --> 01:21:33.755
SOMEONE IN THE SHERIFF'S

01:21:33.822 --> 01:21:35.190
DEPARTMENT TO REVIEW OUR REPORT

01:21:35.257 --> 01:21:36.891
WE NOW HAVE NO BACKLOG AND WE

01:21:36.958 --> 01:21:38.727
ALSO IN ADDITION TO HAVING NO

01:21:38.793 --> 01:21:40.895
BACKLOG WE ALSO SET UP A SYSTEM

01:21:40.962 --> 01:21:42.797
WHERE WE ARE ACCOUNTABLE EACH OF

01:21:42.864 --> 01:21:44.366
US -- ACCOUNTABLE FOR WHAT

01:21:44.432 --> 01:21:46.134
HAPPENS WE KNOW EVERY EXAM

01:21:46.201 --> 01:21:47.769
THAT'S DONE I GET A REPORT EVERY

01:21:47.836 --> 01:21:49.170
MONTH.

01:21:49.237 --> 01:21:50.939
I KNOW HOW MANY KIDS ARE HOW

01:21:51.006 --> 01:21:51.706
MANY REPORTS.

01:21:51.773 --> 01:21:53.441
OF SEXUAL SORRY PORTS ARE MADE

01:21:53.508 --> 01:21:55.143
TO EACH LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY I

01:21:55.210 --> 01:21:56.611
KNOW WHETHER OR NOT THAT LAW

01:21:56.678 --> 01:21:58.580
ENFORCEMENT AGENCY HAS REQUESTED

01:21:58.647 --> 01:22:01.583
OR OTHERS AUTHORIZED THE KID TO

01:22:01.650 --> 01:22:02.183
BE DONE OR AN EXAM.

01:22:02.250 --> 01:22:03.285
WE KNOW WHETHER OR NOT IT'S BEEN

01:22:03.351 --> 01:22:04.986
SUBMITTED AND SO I CAN KEEP

01:22:05.053 --> 01:22:06.288
TRACK OF THAT IN THE DATA KEEPS

01:22:06.354 --> 01:22:07.589
PEOPLE KEEP ALL OF US

01:22:07.656 --> 01:22:09.057
ACCOUNTABLE.

01:22:09.124 --> 01:22:10.392
BUT I DIDN'T SHOULD STOP THERE.

01:22:10.458 --> 01:22:12.027
BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS I DID

01:22:12.093 --> 01:22:13.728
WAS I WENT TO WASHINGTON DC AND

01:22:13.795 --> 01:22:15.130
AS A RESULT OF THE WORK THAT WE

01:22:15.196 --> 01:22:17.198
DID IN WASHINGTON WHITE A

01:22:17.265 --> 01:22:18.366
MEETING AT THE WHITE HOUSE.

01:22:18.433 --> 01:22:19.868
EXPLAIN THE BACKLOG IN THE LAW

01:22:19.934 --> 01:22:21.236
ENFORCEMENT PROPERTY ROOMS.

01:22:21.303 --> 01:22:22.837
WE DID A DIAGRAM FOR THEM AND

01:22:22.904 --> 01:22:24.105
THEY UNDERSTOOD AND PRESENT A

01:22:24.172 --> 01:22:25.774
MAMA PUT MONEY IN HIS BUDGET FOR

01:22:25.840 --> 01:22:27.108
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACROSS OUR

01:22:27.175 --> 01:22:28.410
NATION.

01:22:28.476 --> 01:22:30.111
THAT IS CONTINUED AND NOW

01:22:30.178 --> 01:22:31.746
THERE'S OVER ONE HUNDRED AND

01:22:31.813 --> 01:22:32.981
SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS THAT HAS

01:22:33.048 --> 01:22:34.616
BEEN ALLOCATED TO LOCAL LAW

01:22:34.683 --> 01:22:36.151
ENFORCEMENT DOJ HAS BEEN THE

01:22:36.217 --> 01:22:38.153
RECIPIENT OF SOME OF THAT MONEY.

01:22:38.219 --> 01:22:40.522
I KNOW AND MY AND IT IS STILL IN

01:22:40.588 --> 01:22:43.325
THE IN THE NEW THE UPCOMING

01:22:43.391 --> 01:22:44.659
BUDGET FOR THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR

01:22:44.726 --> 01:22:46.594
OF NINETEEN TWENTY FOR THE

01:22:46.661 --> 01:22:48.063
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ANOTHER FORTY

01:22:48.129 --> 01:22:49.264
FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. FOR LOCAL

01:22:49.331 --> 01:22:51.299
LAW ENFORCEMENT SO THE THE PART

01:22:51.366 --> 01:22:52.500
SO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS

01:22:52.567 --> 01:22:54.269
PUT THEIR RESOURCES.

01:22:54.336 --> 01:22:56.037
INTO A LOT OF RESOURCES FOR

01:22:56.104 --> 01:22:57.906
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT NOT ONLY

01:22:57.972 --> 01:22:59.040
TO TEST KITS BUT TO SET UP

01:22:59.107 --> 01:23:00.108
PROCEDURES.

01:23:00.175 --> 01:23:01.576
LIKE MINE IN ALAMEDA COUNTY

01:23:01.643 --> 01:23:03.178
WHERE THERE IS NEVER GOING TO BE

01:23:03.244 --> 01:23:05.580
AN OPPORTUNITY FOR BACK LOVE TO

01:23:05.647 --> 01:23:07.415
HER AGAIN.

01:23:07.482 --> 01:23:09.351
OF THE SAFETY DATABASE -- THAT

01:23:09.417 --> 01:23:10.685
WAS JUST TALK ABOUT IT WAS OF

01:23:10.752 --> 01:23:12.120
LEGISLATION THAT I SPONSORED AND

01:23:12.187 --> 01:23:13.221
I THINK IT'S CRITICALLY

01:23:13.288 --> 01:23:16.491
IMPORTANT BECAUSE NOT ONLY ARE

01:23:16.558 --> 01:23:17.792
THE PROPERTY ROOMS LOGGING IN I

01:23:17.859 --> 01:23:19.194
MEAN ONE OF THE BIGGEST PITFALLS

01:23:19.260 --> 01:23:20.295
FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT IS WHAT

01:23:20.362 --> 01:23:21.663
HAPPENS WITH PROPERTY.

01:23:21.730 --> 01:23:23.665
AND EVIDENCE SO IT'S LOGGED IN

01:23:23.732 --> 01:23:25.233
ITS VERY CAREFULLY MONITORED.

01:23:25.300 --> 01:23:26.868
IT'S JUST A FEW MORE KEYSTROKES

01:23:26.935 --> 01:23:29.637
TO LOG INTO THE SAFETY DATABASE

01:23:29.704 --> 01:23:30.605
AND THAT WE WERE ALWAYS GOING TO

01:23:30.672 --> 01:23:33.742
KNOW WITH THE CLICK OF A A QUERY

01:23:33.808 --> 01:23:35.009
TO FIND OUT HOW MANY KIDS ARE IN

01:23:35.076 --> 01:23:36.478
THE CRIME LAB.

01:23:36.544 --> 01:23:39.647
I DO BELIEVE THAT -- THAT WE

01:23:39.714 --> 01:23:41.249
HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO BUT THE

01:23:41.316 --> 01:23:43.418
TECHNOLOGY IS MOVING SO FAST

01:23:43.485 --> 01:23:45.653
THAT I BELIEVE THAT SOME OF OUR

01:23:45.720 --> 01:23:47.655
CRIME LABS HAVE NOT KEPT UP DOJ

01:23:47.722 --> 01:23:49.524
IS ACTUALLY OUR MODEL. FOR

01:23:49.591 --> 01:23:51.226
TESTING EQUIPMENT TO LET OTHERS

01:23:51.292 --> 01:23:52.494
ARE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:23:52.560 --> 01:23:54.662
AGENCIES AND THE CRIME LABS KNOW

01:23:54.729 --> 01:23:56.064
THAT THIS IS EQUIPMENT THAT WILL

01:23:56.131 --> 01:23:57.432
HELP BE MORE EFFICIENT.

01:23:57.499 --> 01:23:59.167
REQUIRES FEWER CRIMINALISTS I

01:23:59.234 --> 01:24:00.068
MEAN THERE HAS TO BE

01:24:00.135 --> 01:24:01.269
CRIMINALISED BUT A LOT OF IT IS

01:24:01.336 --> 01:24:02.437
DONE BEING DONE.

01:24:02.504 --> 01:24:03.705
BY TECHNICIANS WERE ASSISTING

01:24:03.772 --> 01:24:05.540
THE CRIMINALIST TO GO THROUGH

01:24:05.607 --> 01:24:07.475
THE TECHNOLOGY THROUGH ROBOTICS

01:24:07.542 --> 01:24:09.344
AND OTHER THINGS LIKE THAT.

01:24:09.411 --> 01:24:10.879
I AND THAT'S THOSE ARE WAYS THAT

01:24:10.945 --> 01:24:12.714
FOR ALL OF THE THE NUMBER OF

01:24:12.781 --> 01:24:14.549
SEXUAL SOLVE CRIMES WHICH IS

01:24:14.616 --> 01:24:15.250
STAGGERING.

01:24:15.316 --> 01:24:17.752
STILL -- THAT THAT IS OUR

01:24:17.819 --> 01:24:21.222
ABILITY TO TAP INTO THE

01:24:21.289 --> 01:24:22.424
TECHNOLOGY.

01:24:22.490 --> 01:24:22.991
THAT OCCURRED IN OF THIS ALL

01:24:23.057 --> 01:24:24.092
STARTED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR

01:24:24.159 --> 01:24:24.292
WHEN.

01:24:24.359 --> 01:24:25.693
BILL LOCKYER WAS THE ATTORNEY

01:24:25.760 --> 01:24:27.095
GENERAL WHO PUT FIFTY MILLION

01:24:27.162 --> 01:24:29.364
DOLLARS INTO CREATING THE

01:24:29.431 --> 01:24:30.732
INFRASTRUCTURES OF DNA.

01:24:30.799 --> 01:24:33.201
OF LABS TO DO DNA WORK AND WE'RE

01:24:33.268 --> 01:24:34.969
STILL HERE AND WE STILL HAVE

01:24:35.036 --> 01:24:36.471
KIDS THAT ARE UNTESTED.

01:24:36.538 --> 01:24:39.240
SO -- THIS IS AN EFFORT THAT I

01:24:39.307 --> 01:24:41.709
AM SO THANKFUL THAT THE THE

01:24:41.776 --> 01:24:42.977
AUDITS THAT WERE DONE TO GIVE

01:24:43.044 --> 01:24:44.579
FOCUS TO THIS I DO I AM

01:24:44.646 --> 01:24:46.414
SPONSORING NOW THE LEGISLATION

01:24:46.481 --> 01:24:48.383
TO REQUIRE LAW ENFORCEMENT. TO

01:24:48.450 --> 01:24:50.919
SUBMIT ALL KIDS TO BE TESTED AND

01:24:50.985 --> 01:24:52.420
WE LAST YEAR WE GOT TO THE

01:24:52.487 --> 01:24:53.988
LEGISLATURE WITHOUT ANY NO VOTES

01:24:54.055 --> 01:24:55.390
BUT THE GOVERNOR VETOED IT.

01:24:55.457 --> 01:24:57.091
AT THE LAST MINUTE THIS YEAR WE

01:24:57.158 --> 01:24:58.359
HOPE THAT WE'LL BE ABLE TO BE

01:24:58.426 --> 01:24:59.727
SUCCESSFUL AND CHANGE THAT

01:24:59.794 --> 01:25:02.130
PARADIGM -- AND THEN JUST ONE

01:25:02.197 --> 01:25:03.364
MORE THING TO JUST REITERATE IS

01:25:03.431 --> 01:25:05.033

DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S IN EACH

01:25:06.100 --> 01:25:07.535

REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT

01:26:19.607 --> 01:26:21.743

DECIDED NOT TO BE TESTED TO MAKE

01:26:34.956 --> 01:26:36.090
SURE THAT EVERY KID WAS TESTED.

01:26:36.157 --> 01:26:39.394
CURRENTLY AS IT STANDS TODAY --

01:26:39.460 --> 01:26:42.063
WE ARE CURRENT BACK THROUGH TWO

INTEGRATED INTO THEIR CASELOADS.

01:26:54.442 --> 01:26:56.077
AND WE HAVE APPROXIMATELY A

01:26:56.144 --> 01:26:57.011
HUNDRED AND NINETY TWO KITS

01:26:57.078 --> 01:26:58.379

IT'LL BE COMPLETED WELL BEFORE

01:26:59.347 --> 01:27:01.082
THE END OF THE YEAR -- AND THAT

01:27:01.149 --> 01:27:02.817
WILL KEEP US CURRENT IT IT TAKES

01:27:02.884 --> 01:27:05.520
US ROUGHLY -- WITHIN FORTY FIVE

01:27:05.587 --> 01:27:07.689
DAYS TO TOUCH TEST EACH SEXUAL

01:27:07.755 --> 01:27:11.092
ASSAULT KIT -- IT.

01:27:11.159 --> 01:27:13.194
OUR PROCESS OF OF DIRECTLY

01:27:13.261 --> 01:27:14.596
RECEIVING THOSE KIDS INTO OUR

01:27:14.662 --> 01:27:16.464
CRIME LAB REMOVE SOME OF THE

01:27:16.531 --> 01:27:18.032
CONCERNS WERE ADDRESSED BY THE

01:27:18.099 --> 01:27:19.601
AUTHOR ABOUT SOME OF THE ISSUES

01:27:19.667 --> 01:27:20.802
WHY KIDS ARE TESTED.

01:27:20.868 --> 01:27:22.604
UP OCCASIONALLY THE EXCEPTIONS

01:27:22.670 --> 01:27:23.671
WOULD BE IF THERE'S IF IT'S

01:27:23.738 --> 01:27:24.906
DETERMINED THAT NO CRIME HAS

01:27:24.973 --> 01:27:26.074
BEEN COMMITTED WHATSOEVER ON

01:27:26.140 --> 01:27:27.141
THOSE SORT OF OR ON A CASE BY

01:27:27.208 --> 01:27:28.343
CASE BASIS.

01:27:28.409 --> 01:27:29.644
BUT EVEN IF THERE'S NO REQUEST

01:27:29.711 --> 01:27:31.012
FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT.

01:27:31.079 --> 01:27:32.947
OUR COUNTY TEST THOSE KITS

01:27:33.014 --> 01:27:33.514
REGARDLESS.

01:27:33.581 --> 01:27:35.750
AND I DON'T THINK IT'S MUCH IN

01:27:35.817 --> 01:27:38.987
DISPUTE THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE

01:27:39.053 --> 01:27:40.021
INFORMATION THAT CAN BE

01:27:40.088 --> 01:27:43.491
DEVELOPED FROM THOSE CATS -- AS

01:27:43.558 --> 01:27:46.160
MR O'MALLEY MENTIONED EARLIER --

01:27:46.227 --> 01:27:47.762
ONE NOT NEED LOOK FARTHER THAN

01:27:47.829 --> 01:27:49.130
THE GOLDEN STATE KILLER EAST

01:27:49.197 --> 01:27:51.132
AREA RAPIST CASE AS AN EXAMPLE.

01:27:51.199 --> 01:27:52.934
ON THE CASE HAD GONE FOR COLD

01:27:53.001 --> 01:27:54.702
FOR FORTY YEARS THERE WERE

01:27:54.769 --> 01:27:56.237
THIRTEEN MURDERS AND OUR FIFTY

01:27:56.304 --> 01:27:57.672
SEXUAL ASSAULT AND BURGLARIES

01:27:57.739 --> 01:27:59.974
COMMITTED -- BY A MAN WHO

01:28:00.041 --> 01:28:01.843
TERRORIZED OUR STATE AND IT WAS

01:28:01.909 --> 01:28:04.545
DNA THAT KEPT THAT CASE FROM

01:28:04.612 --> 01:28:07.815
BEING UNSOLVED ARE THERE ARE.

01:28:07.882 --> 01:28:09.517
HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN

01:28:09.584 --> 01:28:11.419
SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY JUST

01:28:11.486 --> 01:28:13.121
THIS ONE CASE BUT ULTIMATELY WAS

01:28:13.187 --> 01:28:14.722
SOLVED THROUGH THIS VERY

01:28:14.789 --> 01:28:17.892
IMPORTANT -- PIECE OF TECHNOLOGY

01:28:17.959 --> 01:28:19.460
THAT WERE WE CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE

01:28:19.527 --> 01:28:21.963
OF AND I WOULD ECHO DR WEBER'S

01:28:22.030 --> 01:28:23.865
COMMENTS AND RETURNING

01:28:23.931 --> 01:28:24.999
O'MALLEY'S COMMENTS IN THAT.

01:28:25.066 --> 01:28:27.135
IT'S HELPFUL TO SOLVE OUR CASES

01:28:27.201 --> 01:28:29.904
IT'S VERY HELPFUL TO PROVIDE

01:28:29.971 --> 01:28:32.040
EXONERATIONS AND REMOVE THE

01:28:32.106 --> 01:28:33.474
CLOUD OF SUSPICION.

01:28:33.541 --> 01:28:35.309
WHEN YOU JUST THINKING CONTEXT

01:28:35.376 --> 01:28:36.944
OF THE GOLDEN STATE KILLER CASE

01:28:37.011 --> 01:28:39.280
HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE IDENTIFIED

01:28:39.347 --> 01:28:41.749
AS POTENTIAL SUSPECTS -- JUST

01:28:41.816 --> 01:28:43.785
GIVEN THE NUMBER OF CRIMES THAT

01:28:43.851 --> 01:28:46.821
WERE COMMITTED AND TO BE ABLE TO

01:28:46.888 --> 01:28:49.624
USE OF THESE.

01:28:49.691 --> 01:28:50.725
USE THE PROFILE WITH THAT ARE

01:28:50.792 --> 01:28:52.093
DEVELOPING THESE KIDS TO BE ABLE

01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:52.860
TO ELIMINATE THE CLOUD OF

01:28:52.927 --> 01:28:57.198
SUSPICION IS IS INVALUABLE -- SO

01:28:57.265 --> 01:28:58.966
FOR THOSE REASONS WE HAVE.

01:28:59.033 --> 01:29:01.069
LONG BEEN IN SUPPORT OF TESTING

01:29:01.135 --> 01:29:02.804
EVERY KID THAT COMES IN -- I AND

01:29:02.870 --> 01:29:03.871
I THINK THAT'S THE MOST

01:29:03.938 --> 01:29:05.840
EFFICIENT WAY TO DO IT ON I

01:29:05.907 --> 01:29:07.175
WOULD ECHO THE OTHER COMMENTS OF

01:29:07.241 --> 01:29:08.509
JUST RETURNING O'MALLEY AND BE

01:29:08.576 --> 01:29:10.578
HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS OR

01:29:10.645 --> 01:29:10.945
DISCUSS FURTHER.

AND SIR BORDERS ALSO JOINED US

01:29:24.392 --> 01:29:25.727
BUT I THINK HE HAD RUN TO

01:29:25.793 --> 01:29:28.262
ANOTHER COMMITTEE -- TO VOTE OR

01:29:28.329 --> 01:29:29.931

YOU GUYS TALKED ABOUT.

01:29:38.106 --> 01:29:39.173
THE BACKLOG I THINK IT WAS WAS

01:29:39.240 --> 01:29:41.008
SOME ELEY SUBJECT NINETEEN

01:29:41.075 --> 01:29:42.677
HUNDRED AT ONE TIME BUT YOU'VE

01:29:42.744 --> 01:29:43.111
WORKED THROUGH THAT

01:29:43.177 --> 01:29:51.219
SYSTEMATICALLY -- WE'RE TRYING

01:29:51.285 --> 01:29:51.819
TO DO IS GET MY ARMS AROUND.

01:29:51.886 --> 01:29:52.820
WHAT YOU GUYS SAID WHY WE DON'T

01:29:52.887 --> 01:29:53.755
SEE THAT IN EVERY LAW

01:29:53.821 --> 01:29:54.756
ENFORCEMENT AGENCY?

01:29:54.822 --> 01:29:55.957
UP AND DOWN THE ENTIRE STATE AND

01:29:56.023 --> 01:29:56.190
DOJ'S.

01:29:56.257 --> 01:29:57.024
SEEN SOME OF THIS INFORMATION

01:29:57.091 --> 01:30:00.895
BUT YOU TALKED ABOUT FEDERAL

01:30:00.962 --> 01:30:02.497
FUNDING IN GOING TO DC IN

01:30:02.563 --> 01:30:07.101
GETTING FEDERAL REALLY JUST A

01:30:07.168 --> 01:30:09.637
RESOURCE QUESTION OR IS THIS.

01:30:09.704 --> 01:30:11.606
I MEAN WHAT ELSE IS LACKING OR

01:30:11.672 --> 01:30:13.341
WHAT I TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT.

01:30:13.407 --> 01:30:15.510
AT THROUGH STATURE DO WE DO HERE

01:30:15.576 --> 01:30:16.744
AT THE STATE YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY

01:30:16.811 --> 01:30:17.945
WE HAD LEGISLATION PREVIOUSLY

01:30:18.012 --> 01:30:19.547
YOU HELP SPONSOR SOME

01:30:19.614 --> 01:30:20.248
LEGISLATION AS WELL WE HAVE

01:30:20.314 --> 01:30:22.517
CURRENT -- LEGISLATION IN THE

01:30:22.583 --> 01:30:24.952
SENATE SENATE BILL TWENTY TWO

01:30:25.019 --> 01:30:27.989
RIGHT -- TRYING TO GET MY ARMS

01:30:28.055 --> 01:30:29.757
JUST AROUND THAT PIECE OF

01:30:29.824 --> 01:30:31.893
PERHAPS MISTER DYER MISS AMOUNT

01:30:31.959 --> 01:30:32.727
IF YOU CAN JUST ADDRESS THAT.

01:30:32.794 --> 01:30:33.928
IN A LOT OF THE RESEARCH THAT I

01:30:33.995 --> 01:30:35.096
DID WAS TALKING TO LAW

01:30:35.163 --> 01:30:36.531
ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES.

01:30:36.597 --> 01:30:38.399
NOT JUST IN MY COUNTY BUT IN

01:30:38.466 --> 01:30:40.067
CALIFORNIA CROSS COUNTRY.

01:30:40.134 --> 01:30:41.469
AND FOR A LOT OF THE OFFICERS TO

01:30:41.536 --> 01:30:43.037
DO THE INVESTIGATION THEY WOULD

01:30:43.104 --> 01:30:44.172
PUT THE KID.

01:30:44.238 --> 01:30:45.540
IN THEIR EVIDENCE ROOM.

01:30:45.606 --> 01:30:47.008
AND THAT WOULD BE THE LAST TIME

01:30:47.074 --> 01:30:47.875
A POLICE OFFICER WOULD EVER

01:30:47.942 --> 01:30:49.277
TOUCH IT THE NEXT PERSON TO

01:30:49.343 --> 01:30:50.511
TOUCH IT WOULD BE A CRIME LAB

01:30:50.578 --> 01:30:51.479
ANALYST.

01:30:51.546 --> 01:30:53.047
AND SO THERE'S A DISK THERE HAS

01:30:53.114 --> 01:30:54.682
BEEN A DISCONNECT BETWEEN THE

01:30:54.749 --> 01:30:55.883
OFFICERS.

01:30:55.950 --> 01:30:57.852
WHO ARE DOING THE A PRIMARY

01:30:57.919 --> 01:30:59.821
INVESTIGATION AND MAKING SURE

01:30:59.887 --> 01:31:01.422
THAT KID GETS TO THE CRIME LAB

01:31:01.489 --> 01:31:03.925
OR LIKE IN THE CASE OF OAKLAND?

01:31:03.991 --> 01:31:05.993
WHERE THEIR LAB IS IN THE SAME

01:31:06.060 --> 01:31:07.295
BUILDING AS THEIR PROPERTY ROOM?

01:31:07.361 --> 01:31:08.896
THAT SOMEBODY FROM THE LAB WOULD

01:31:08.963 --> 01:31:09.864
HAVE TO GO DOWN AND TAKE THAT

01:31:09.931 --> 01:31:11.732
PROPERTY OUT AND TAKE IT UP TO

01:31:11.799 --> 01:31:12.366
BE.

01:31:12.433 --> 01:31:14.435
A TO BE EXAMINED SO I THINK THAT

01:31:14.502 --> 01:31:15.369
THERE'S BEEN A DISCONNECT

01:31:15.436 --> 01:31:20.007
BETWEEN THE CRIME LABS AND THE

01:31:20.074 --> 01:31:20.842
THE INVESTIGATING OFFICERS.

01:31:20.908 --> 01:31:22.977
THE SECOND PART IS.

01:31:23.044 --> 01:31:24.946
I THINK THAT THERE'S BEEN A MIS

01:31:25.012 --> 01:31:27.215
UNDERSTANDING OR A MYTH THAT IF

01:31:27.281 --> 01:31:29.283
SOMEBODY IDENTIFIES ARE NO SIR

01:31:29.350 --> 01:31:30.918
PERPETRATOR WHICH IS SIGNIFICANT

01:31:30.985 --> 01:31:32.954
PERCENTAGE OF SEXUAL SOLVE

01:31:33.020 --> 01:31:35.256
CRIMES ARE COMMITTED BY SOMEONE

01:31:35.323 --> 01:31:36.724
KNOWN. TO THE SURVIVOR.

01:31:36.791 --> 01:31:38.159
BUT WHAT WHAT GETS LOST IN THERE

01:31:38.226 --> 01:31:39.927
SO WHY WOULD YOU TEST THE DNA IF

01:31:39.994 --> 01:31:40.361
YOU ALREADY KNOW THE

01:31:40.428 --> 01:31:41.362
IDENTIFICATION.

01:31:41.429 --> 01:31:42.864
BUT WHAT WE FOUND IN TESTING

01:31:42.930 --> 01:31:45.066
KITS ACROSS AMERICA IS THAT

01:31:45.132 --> 01:31:46.234
THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE

01:31:46.300 --> 01:31:47.668
SERIAL RAPIST.

01:31:47.735 --> 01:31:49.470
AND JUST YOU'LL -- IF YOU

01:31:49.537 --> 01:31:51.138
HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE I AM

01:31:51.205 --> 01:31:53.074
EVIDENCE DONE BY MERCY HERE QUE

01:31:53.140 --> 01:31:54.508
YOU MAY HEAR ABOUT THAT IN THE

01:31:54.575 --> 01:31:56.010
NEXT PANEL.

01:31:56.077 --> 01:31:57.345
THAT REALLY REFLECTS HOW MANY

01:31:57.411 --> 01:31:58.846
SERIAL RAPISTS THEY WERE ABLE TO

01:31:58.913 --> 01:31:59.981
IDENTIFY.

01:32:00.047 --> 01:32:01.716
BY EVEN THOUGH ONE OF THE THEY

01:32:01.782 --> 01:32:04.051
ROUTE ONE RATE THAT CAME TO

01:32:04.118 --> 01:32:04.986
THEIR ATTENTION.

01:32:05.052 --> 01:32:06.320
WAS -- COMMITTED AGAINST

01:32:06.387 --> 01:32:07.822
SOMEBODY KNOWN BY THE

01:32:07.889 --> 01:32:09.257
PERPETRATOR.

01:32:09.323 --> 01:32:10.791
SO THIS IS AN IMPORTANT POINT

01:32:10.858 --> 01:32:13.761
BECAUSE IT NOT ONLY IS YOU KNOW

01:32:13.828 --> 01:32:16.264
THE OFFICERS LOOK AT ONE CASE AT

01:32:16.330 --> 01:32:17.465
A TIME.

01:32:17.531 --> 01:32:18.132
AND DNA HAS SHOWN IS THAT THERE

01:32:18.199 --> 01:32:20.635
ARE MANY CASES IN MY OWN COUNTY

01:32:20.701 --> 01:32:22.803
MY OWN COUNTY IN BERKELEY --

01:32:22.870 --> 01:32:25.606
THERE WAS A SEXUAL SOLVE CRIME.

01:32:25.673 --> 01:32:27.208
SHE SUBMITTED TO AN EXAM AND

01:32:27.275 --> 01:32:28.910
NEVER GOT SUBMITTED FOR TESTING.

01:32:28.976 --> 01:32:30.444
THE SECOND SEXUAL ASSAULT CRIME

01:32:30.511 --> 01:32:32.380
HAPPENED AND THAT THAT VICTIM

01:32:32.446 --> 01:32:33.614
WAS MURDERED.

01:32:33.681 --> 01:32:34.982
THE THIRD SEXUAL SAW CRIME

01:32:35.049 --> 01:32:36.517
HAPPENED AND THE THAT WOMAN

01:32:36.584 --> 01:32:37.919
SUBMITTED TO TESTING.

01:32:37.985 --> 01:32:39.887
AND WHEN WE FINALLY WENT TO

01:32:39.954 --> 01:32:41.122
BERKELEY AND SAID GIVE US ALL

01:32:41.188 --> 01:32:44.292
YOUR KIDS -- THAT WE TESTED WE

01:32:44.358 --> 01:32:45.693
FOUND IT WAS THE SAME PERSON.

01:32:45.760 --> 01:32:47.461
AND THIS IS THE TOO MANY

01:32:47.528 --> 01:32:49.330
EXAMPLES OF THAT SO I DON'T I

01:32:49.397 --> 01:32:50.998
THINK THAT WE AGAIN THIS IS A

01:32:51.065 --> 01:32:52.633
PLACE WHERE I THINK THE DISTRICT

01:32:52.700 --> 01:32:53.301
ATTORNEYS HAVE AN IMPORTANT ROLE

01:32:53.367 --> 01:32:54.268
TO PLAY.

01:32:54.335 --> 01:32:55.703
I THINK THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF

01:32:55.770 --> 01:32:56.871
WORK TO DO AROUND.

01:32:56.938 --> 01:32:58.306
A TRAINING DISTRICT ATTORNEYS

01:32:58.372 --> 01:32:59.640
AND PROSECUTORS WHO ARE

01:32:59.707 --> 01:33:00.708
REVIEWING CASES FOR WHETHER

01:33:00.775 --> 01:33:02.543
THERE IS SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO

01:33:02.610 --> 01:33:03.844
PROSECUTE.

01:33:03.911 --> 01:33:05.313
BUT IMPORTANTLY I THINK THAT

01:33:05.379 --> 01:33:06.580
THERE HAS TO BE.

01:33:06.647 --> 01:33:08.215
MUCH MORE COORDINATION AN

01:33:08.282 --> 01:33:10.685
EMPHASIS ON SOMEONE HAS TO TAKE

01:33:10.751 --> 01:33:13.120
THE LEAD SO EVEN THOUGH THE THE

01:33:13.187 --> 01:33:14.522
CRIME THE PROPERTY ROOM.

01:33:14.588 --> 01:33:18.159
MANAGERS WILL ENTER INTO SAFETY.

01:33:18.225 --> 01:33:19.961
THAT IF THAT DOUBLE INFINITE

01:33:20.027 --> 01:33:20.661
KNOW WHATEVER CHECKS THAT

01:33:20.728 --> 01:33:22.897
DATABASE THEN IT'S JUST THERE

01:33:22.964 --> 01:33:24.465
SITTING THERE LIKE WE'VE SEEN

01:33:24.532 --> 01:33:25.433
OVER THE YEARS.

01:33:25.499 --> 01:33:26.968
AND SO I DID I DO BELIEVE THAT

01:33:27.034 --> 01:33:28.936
THE I DON'T I THINK THE

01:33:29.003 --> 01:33:30.237
LEGISLATION TO REQUIRE ALL TEST

01:33:30.304 --> 01:33:32.106
KITS TO BE TESTED.

01:33:32.173 --> 01:33:33.607
IS REALLY IMPORTANT LEGISLATION.

01:33:33.674 --> 01:33:36.410
I ALSO THINK THAT TAPPING INTO

01:33:36.477 --> 01:33:38.579
THE MODERN -- TECHNOLOGY THAT

01:33:38.646 --> 01:33:41.015
EXISTS TO ASSIST THE CRIME LABS

01:33:41.082 --> 01:33:42.683
TO BE MORE EFFICIENT IN THEIR

01:33:42.750 --> 01:33:43.551
TESTING.

01:33:43.617 --> 01:33:46.821
AND AND ACTUALLY AND I AND THIS

01:33:46.887 --> 01:33:48.255
ISSUE ABOUT.

01:33:48.322 --> 01:33:49.490
AN OUTSIDE LAB WHO ARE OFTEN

01:33:49.557 --> 01:33:51.325
TIMES.

01:33:51.392 --> 01:33:52.393
COST LESS MONEY THAN THE

01:33:52.460 --> 01:33:54.028
GOVERNMENT LABS DO.

01:33:54.095 --> 01:33:56.630
OUR FASTER AND YOU KNOW FRANKLY --

01:33:56.697 --> 01:33:57.932
YOU KNOW IF THEY MAKE A MISTAKE

01:33:57.999 --> 01:33:59.333
THEY'RE OUT OF BUSINESS AND SO

01:33:59.400 --> 01:34:01.235
WE'VE SEEN -- WITH THE LAB THAT

01:34:01.302 --> 01:34:03.738
WE WORK WITH A LOT OF VERY GOOD --

01:34:03.804 --> 01:34:05.039
ACCOUNTABILITY.

01:34:05.106 --> 01:34:07.108
BUT IF IT TAKES THREE YEARS TO

01:34:07.174 --> 01:34:09.276
REVIEW A REPORT REVIEW REPORTS

01:34:09.343 --> 01:34:10.077
THEN WE ARE NOT SOLVING THE

01:34:10.144 --> 01:34:11.112
PROBLEM.

01:34:11.178 --> 01:34:13.214
SO WE ACTUALLY HAVE A PILOT THAT

01:34:13.280 --> 01:34:15.449
WE'VE PITCH TO THE FBI. TO SEE

01:34:15.516 --> 01:34:16.884
IF WE CAN DO SOME WORK AROUND.

01:34:16.951 --> 01:34:19.520
REDUCING THE TIME THAT IT TAKES

01:34:19.587 --> 01:34:20.955
TWO TO REVIEW THOSE REPORT TO

01:34:21.022 --> 01:34:23.491
GET THESE PROFILES INTO THE

01:34:23.557 --> 01:34:25.760
NATIONAL DATABASE FASTER

01:34:25.826 --> 01:34:26.060
[inaudible]

01:34:26.127 --> 01:34:28.696
SO.

01:34:28.763 --> 01:34:30.898
THANK YOU AND I APPRECIATE THAT.

01:34:30.965 --> 01:34:33.801
SO DO YOU HAVE.

01:34:33.868 --> 01:34:34.902
GIVE A POLICY NOW IT HAS ALL

01:34:34.969 --> 01:34:38.005
YOUR KIDS AND WE DO YOU DO.

01:34:38.072 --> 01:34:39.373
I THINK MR GEYER SAID YOU SAID

01:34:39.440 --> 01:34:41.409
YOU WHICH SAID IT DIRECTLY

01:34:41.475 --> 01:34:43.277
THOUGH RIGHT TO THE LAB THE WHEN

01:34:43.344 --> 01:34:45.513
THE WHEN THE FORENSIC MEDICAL

01:34:45.579 --> 01:34:47.848
EXAM IS COMPLETED AT OUR WHAT WE

01:34:47.915 --> 01:34:49.583
CALL OUR BEAR CENTER AT OUR AT

01:34:49.650 --> 01:34:51.852
OUR FORENSIC MEDICAL.

01:34:51.919 --> 01:34:52.720
CENTER THOSE KIDS ARE THEN.

01:34:52.787 --> 01:34:55.856
TAKEN DIRECTLY TO OUR CRIME LAB.

01:34:55.923 --> 01:34:57.425
SO IT NEVER GOES TO THAT NEVER

01:34:57.491 --> 01:34:58.526
GOES TO AN EVIDENCE LOCKER NEVER

01:34:58.592 --> 01:35:00.061
GOES LAW ENFORCEMENT FACILITY IT

01:35:00.127 --> 01:35:01.729
MAY BE TRANSPORTED BY LAW

01:35:01.796 --> 01:35:02.997
ENFORCEMENT BUT IT GOES DIRECTLY

01:35:03.064 --> 01:35:05.232
TO OUR LAB.

01:35:05.299 --> 01:35:05.766
AS SOON AS THE TESTING IS

01:35:05.833 --> 01:35:06.634
COMPLETED.

01:35:06.700 --> 01:35:09.270
SO ANY ANY ANY.

01:35:09.336 --> 01:35:11.305
UNTESTED KIDS OR RESULT OF OUR

01:35:11.372 --> 01:35:13.607
DECISION NOT TO HAVE DONE THAT

01:35:13.674 --> 01:35:15.042
FOR OUR DIVISION OF RESOURCES

01:35:15.109 --> 01:35:17.178
THAT WE HAVE NOW BEEN ABLE.

01:35:17.244 --> 01:35:19.313
TO ELIMINATE AND AN AD. TO THE

01:35:19.380 --> 01:35:20.481
CASE LOADS OF OUR ANALYSTS TO

01:35:20.548 --> 01:35:22.049
GET THOSE CASES DOWN AND I WOULD

01:35:22.116 --> 01:35:23.317
I WOULD ECHO WHAT.

01:35:23.384 --> 01:35:25.386
MS O'MALLEY SAID THAT IT IN OUR

01:35:25.453 --> 01:35:26.420
EXPERIENCE IT WAS SORT OF OUT OF

01:35:26.487 --> 01:35:29.890
SORT OF A PHILOSOPHY SHIFT AWAY

01:35:29.957 --> 01:35:31.859
FROM JUST SOLVING THE CASE THIS

01:35:31.926 --> 01:35:33.761
CASE WAS A CONSENT CASE THIS

01:35:33.828 --> 01:35:35.563
CASE WAS A SPOUSAL RAPE CASE AND

01:35:35.629 --> 01:35:38.065
AS AS DISTRICT ATTORNEY O'MALLEY

01:35:38.132 --> 01:35:39.166
POINTED OUT.

01:35:39.233 --> 01:35:41.268
WE'VE SPENT OUR CAREERS

01:35:41.335 --> 01:35:43.170
PROSECUTING SEX CRIME CASES AND

01:35:43.237 --> 01:35:43.904
AND IT AND IT'S TRUE THAT

01:35:43.971 --> 01:35:44.905
SOMEONE WHO.

01:35:44.972 --> 01:35:46.874
COMMITS A SPOUSAL RAPE WILL ALSO

01:35:46.941 --> 01:35:49.176
RAPE A STRANGER -- AND THAT THE

01:35:49.243 --> 01:35:51.545
OVERLAP OF THOSE CASES IS IS ON

01:35:51.612 --> 01:35:53.414
DOUBTED AND THE NEED FOR IT IS

01:35:53.481 --> 01:35:55.249
CRITICAL.

01:35:55.316 --> 01:35:56.283
CAN I JUST ADD THAT.

01:35:56.350 --> 01:35:57.985
IN SEVERAL OF THE A FEW OF THE

01:35:58.052 --> 01:36:00.287
COUNTIES WE DON'T USE THE DOJ

01:36:00.354 --> 01:36:01.989
LAB ANYMORE BECAUSE WE HAVE OUR

01:36:02.056 --> 01:36:04.458
OWN CRIME LET THE SHERIFF'S HAS

01:36:04.525 --> 01:36:05.059
ONE OAKLAND POLICE HAS AND HAS

01:36:05.126 --> 01:36:05.893
THEIR OWN.

01:36:05.960 --> 01:36:07.795
SAME THING IN LOS ANGELES LAPD

01:36:07.862 --> 01:36:10.865
HAS AROUND LA SHERIFF HAS HIS --

01:36:10.931 --> 01:36:13.834
AND SO THERE ARE IN LA THERE'S

01:36:13.901 --> 01:36:15.536
AN ORDINANCE THAT THEY HAVE TO

01:36:15.603 --> 01:36:16.904
TEST THE KIDS AND THEY THEIR

01:36:16.971 --> 01:36:18.672
TIME LINE IS THE SAME AS THE

01:36:18.739 --> 01:36:20.541
LEGISLATION -- AND WHEN WE ARE

01:36:20.608 --> 01:36:22.343
CRAFTING THAT LEGISLATION WE'VE

01:36:22.409 --> 01:36:23.611
REACHED OUT TO THEM.

01:36:23.677 --> 01:36:24.879
BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE HIGHEST

01:36:24.945 --> 01:36:27.314
NUMBER OF KIDS TWO OF FOR AN

01:36:27.381 --> 01:36:29.150
AGENCY.

01:36:29.216 --> 01:36:30.518
TO WHAT WOULD IT TAKE WHAT CAN

01:36:30.584 --> 01:36:32.520
THEY DO WHAT'S REALISTIC --

01:36:32.586 --> 01:36:33.988
ORANGE COUNTY TESOL THEIR KIDS

01:36:34.054 --> 01:36:36.223
LA TESTS ALL THEIR KIDS SO THERE

01:36:36.290 --> 01:36:37.491
ARE INDEED AND NOW WILL COMPLETE

01:36:37.558 --> 01:36:39.026
OAKLAND POLICE ALSO TESTS ALL

01:36:39.093 --> 01:36:39.860
THEIR KIDS.

01:36:39.927 --> 01:36:41.662
SO THERE BEEN A LOT OF THOSE

01:36:41.729 --> 01:36:43.464
REALLY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN

01:36:43.531 --> 01:36:45.366
THE THE BIGGER LABS THAT ARE

01:36:45.432 --> 01:36:46.967
CONNECTED TO A POLICE DEPARTMENT

01:36:47.034 --> 01:36:49.170
OR TO ACCOUNTING LIKE MINE.

01:36:49.236 --> 01:36:52.907
A WHERE THE KIDS ARE BEING ARE

01:36:52.973 --> 01:36:54.708
BEING TESTED.

01:36:54.775 --> 01:36:55.876
SO THE I'M GLAD TO SEE THAT A

01:36:55.943 --> 01:36:56.477
LOT OF COUNTIES ARE ACTUALLY

01:36:56.544 --> 01:36:58.078
MOVING TOWARDS A MODEL BECAUSE

01:36:58.145 --> 01:37:00.014
OF THE CASE OUTCOMES IN THE IF

01:37:00.080 --> 01:37:01.148
IT'S RELATED YOU KNOW TO

01:37:01.215 --> 01:37:03.317
REPROACH HE BROUGHT UP THE NORTH

01:37:03.384 --> 01:37:04.285
CAROLINA.

01:37:04.351 --> 01:37:06.120
INCIDENT EARLIER IN THE PREVIOUS

01:37:06.187 --> 01:37:08.355
PANEL AND SO -- APPRECIATE THAT

01:37:08.422 --> 01:37:10.791
BUT RIGHT NOW YOU. FOR USMLE YOU

01:37:10.858 --> 01:37:13.661
DON'T -- SYNDICATE DIRECTLY TO

01:37:13.727 --> 01:37:15.262
BE TESTED YOU PUT IT IN EVIDENCE

01:37:15.329 --> 01:37:16.964
LOCKER I WAS WONDERING ABOUT

01:37:17.031 --> 01:37:19.800
BEST PRACTICES NOW. FOR FOR

01:37:19.867 --> 01:37:22.336
MOVING FORWARD IT MAYBE WE THAT

01:37:22.403 --> 01:37:23.737
WOULD PROBABLY STREAMLINED IT.

01:37:23.804 --> 01:37:25.739
SO SAN MATEO COUNTY GOES RIGHT

01:37:25.806 --> 01:37:27.041
FROM THEIR SEXUAL ASSAULT

01:37:27.107 --> 01:37:28.309
RESPONSE CENTER.

01:37:28.375 --> 01:37:30.044
WHERE THE EXAMS ARE DONE AND

01:37:30.110 --> 01:37:31.912
THIS THE KID DOESN'T GO BACK TO

01:37:31.979 --> 01:37:33.447
THE POLICE TO GOES DIRECTLY TO

01:37:33.514 --> 01:37:35.015
THEIR CRIME LAB -- AND THAT'S

01:37:35.082 --> 01:37:36.650
VERY EFFICIENT IN MY COUNTY WE

01:37:36.717 --> 01:37:38.152
HAVE TWENTY THREE PLEASE

01:37:38.219 --> 01:37:39.019
JURISDICTIONS.

01:37:39.086 --> 01:37:41.255
AND SUMMER OAKLAND LOGO THAT

01:37:41.322 --> 01:37:42.723
GOES DIRECTLY TO THEIR CRIME LAB

01:37:42.790 --> 01:37:44.491
OR TO THEIR EVIDENCE ROOM WHERE

01:37:44.558 --> 01:37:45.926
IT'S HELD SECURELY.

01:37:45.993 --> 01:37:47.628
AND THEY'RE WITHIN FIVE DAYS

01:37:47.695 --> 01:37:48.896
SOMEONE FROM THE CRIME LAB COMES

01:37:48.963 --> 01:37:50.030
AND GETS IT.

01:37:50.097 --> 01:37:51.332
AND IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE CHAIN

01:37:51.398 --> 01:37:53.267
OF CUSTODY ALSO TO MAKE SURE

01:37:53.334 --> 01:37:54.068
THAT WE HAVE.

01:37:54.134 --> 01:37:54.935
THAT IS.

01:37:55.002 --> 01:37:56.537
HELD IN A UP SOMEWHERE THAT

01:37:56.604 --> 01:37:57.338
SAVED.

01:37:57.404 --> 01:37:59.340
UP BUT WITH THE WITH THE REST OF

01:37:59.406 --> 01:38:01.575
THEM -- WE I DO THINK IT'S A

01:38:01.642 --> 01:38:04.044
GOOD IT'S A GREAT OPPORTUNITY

01:38:04.111 --> 01:38:04.645
SEND IT DIRECTLY TO THE CRIME

01:38:04.712 --> 01:38:08.249
LAB -- AND I THINK THAT.

01:38:08.315 --> 01:38:10.551
THAT WAY -- IT HAS TO BE BOOKED

01:38:10.618 --> 01:38:10.851
IN.

01:38:10.918 --> 01:38:13.487
SOMEWHERE AND YOU KNOW I THINK

01:38:13.554 --> 01:38:14.388
YOU KNOW JUST WITH THE

01:38:14.455 --> 01:38:15.289
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SHERIFF'S

01:38:15.356 --> 01:38:16.857
DEPARTMENT AND DIFFERENT

01:38:16.924 --> 01:38:18.325
MUNICIPALITIES THEY HAVE THEIR

01:38:18.392 --> 01:38:19.893
OWN POLICE AGENCY THERE.

01:38:19.960 --> 01:38:22.763
MAY BE A ISSUE AROUND THAT BUT

01:38:22.830 --> 01:38:24.098
EVERYTHING CAN BE DONE AND I AND

01:38:24.164 --> 01:38:25.566
IN OUR COUNTY WE'RE WE'RE REALLY

01:38:25.633 --> 01:38:27.034
MOVING MORE TOWARDS THAT.

01:38:27.101 --> 01:38:28.569
WITH THE NOT BRINGING IT TO

HIS BILL WHICH I'M SPONSORING.

01:40:21.482 --> 01:40:22.750
A AND THAT WAS THE SAME WITH

01:40:22.816 --> 01:40:24.051
LAST YEAR WHERE THERE WAS MONEY

01:40:24.118 --> 01:40:25.352
ALLOCATED THAT YOU'RE

01:40:25.419 --> 01:40:27.621
LEGISLATURE DID A GAVE IN THE

01:40:27.688 --> 01:40:29.990
GOVERNOR -- CARRIED THROUGH.

01:40:30.057 --> 01:40:32.593
OF THERE IS A BUDGET REQUEST

01:40:32.659 --> 01:40:35.763
ALSO AND I THINK THAT DID.

01:40:35.829 --> 01:40:37.631
THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE HAS

01:40:37.698 --> 01:40:41.535
MODIFIED WHAT THE NEED IS I WANT.

01:40:41.602 --> 01:40:42.503
TO SO THE REQUEST THE BUDGET

01:40:42.569 --> 01:40:44.905
REQUEST I THINK NOW IS.

01:40:44.972 --> 01:40:46.707
800-100-01000 -- FOR AND THAT

01:40:46.774 --> 01:40:48.909
WOULD BE FOR THE SEVEN POINT

01:40:48.976 --> 01:40:50.210
FIVE MILLION WAS REALLY TO FOCUS

01:40:50.277 --> 01:40:51.612
ON BACKLOG.

01:40:51.678 --> 01:40:52.780
BUT THE EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND

01:40:52.846 --> 01:40:53.580
EIGHT THINK IS TO CONTINUE

01:40:53.647 --> 01:40:55.616
MOVING FORWARD.

01:40:55.682 --> 01:40:57.217
WITH ALL KIDS BEING TESTED --

01:40:57.284 --> 01:40:59.887
AND AND I THINK IT'S BEEN AND IF.

01:40:59.953 --> 01:41:03.123
EFFICIENT USE OF THE RESOURCES.

01:41:03.190 --> 01:41:04.425
TO HIRE THE CRIMINALISTS WHEN WE

01:41:04.491 --> 01:41:05.626
HAD THE DOWNTURN.

01:41:05.692 --> 01:41:07.161
IN THE ECONOMY SEVERAL YEARS

01:41:07.227 --> 01:41:09.263
BACK A DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE HAD

01:41:09.329 --> 01:41:11.532
TO LAY OFF A LOT OF STAFF AND

01:41:11.598 --> 01:41:13.300
THEY COULDN'T HIRE CRIMINALIST.

01:41:13.367 --> 01:41:15.202
AND I DON'T SPEAK FOR FOR THEM

01:41:15.269 --> 01:41:16.637
BUT I KNOW A LOT ABOUT THE

01:41:16.703 --> 01:41:17.604
BUSINESS.

01:41:17.671 --> 01:41:19.039
WELL WE WE OUT OF WE HAD IT BACK

01:41:19.106 --> 01:41:20.507
A LOT OF OF THE STAFF FOR THAT

01:41:20.574 --> 01:41:23.110
YES YES SO I DO THINK THAT'S THE

01:41:23.177 --> 01:41:24.611
CASE I ALSO THINK THAT.

01:41:24.678 --> 01:41:26.947
OF FOR THOSE LAB FOR THOSE LAW

01:41:27.014 --> 01:41:28.782
ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES THAT DO NOT

01:41:28.849 --> 01:41:29.783
USE THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

01:41:29.850 --> 01:41:31.852
AND THE POLICY IS IF WE HAVE OUR

01:41:31.919 --> 01:41:33.420
OWN CRIME LAB WE CAN'T USE THE

01:41:33.487 --> 01:41:34.388
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE.

01:41:34.455 --> 01:41:35.756
OTHER THAN VERY UNUSUAL

01:41:35.823 --> 01:41:37.891
CIRCUMSTANCES BUT FOR THOSE

01:41:37.958 --> 01:41:39.126
POLICE AGENCIES.

01:41:39.193 --> 01:41:40.561
THERE MANY OF THE CRIME LABS ARE

01:41:40.627 --> 01:41:42.062
CHARGING THEM THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:41:42.129 --> 01:41:45.265
JUSTICE IS ABLE TO NOT CHARGE

01:41:45.332 --> 01:41:47.134
DOES COUNTY SAY SIR -- BUT FOR

01:41:47.201 --> 01:41:49.169
THE OTHER DEPARTMENTS LIKE LOS

01:41:49.236 --> 01:41:51.004
ANGELES AND OURS.

01:41:51.071 --> 01:41:53.140
AND IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY JUST

01:41:53.207 --> 01:41:55.175
WE HAVE A PRETTY GOOD ONE BRAND

01:41:55.242 --> 01:41:57.277
BRAND NEW EXACTLY REALLY KNOW --

01:41:57.344 --> 01:41:58.946
BUT THE POLICE BUT THE POLICE

01:41:59.012 --> 01:42:00.247
ARE PAYING. TO HAVE THE KIDS

01:42:00.314 --> 01:42:01.348
TESTED.

01:42:01.415 --> 01:42:02.549
AND BECAUSE IT'S A GOVERNMENT

01:42:02.616 --> 01:42:03.851
LAB THERE'S MORE --

01:42:03.917 --> 01:42:05.686
INFRASTRUCTURE SUPPORT THAT'S

01:42:05.752 --> 01:42:07.120
NEEDED SO THAT THE COST IS

01:42:07.187 --> 01:42:09.156
HIGHER -- THAN SOME OF THESE

01:42:09.223 --> 01:42:15.729
OUTSIDE LABS AND SO THERE'S

01:42:15.796 --> 01:42:16.563
SOMEWHERE THAT I THINK WE COULD.

01:42:16.630 --> 01:42:17.464
GET RESOURCES TO LOCAL LAW

01:42:17.531 --> 01:42:18.131
ENFORCEMENT TO AT LEAST GET THEM

01:42:18.198 --> 01:42:18.599
GOING.

01:42:18.665 --> 01:42:19.399
I AND THEN FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN

01:42:19.466 --> 01:42:20.300
REDUCE THE COST THE WAY SOME OF

01:42:20.367 --> 01:42:21.969
THE PRIVATE LABS HAVE BEEN ABLE

01:42:22.035 --> 01:42:22.636
TO DO.

01:42:22.703 --> 01:42:24.071
I THINK WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL

01:42:24.137 --> 01:42:25.172
I'LL TALK TO CENTER SKINNER

01:42:25.239 --> 01:42:26.707
WHOSE IT'S THE COMMITTEES

01:42:26.773 --> 01:42:29.209
BASICALLY MYSELF CENTER CAN EARN

01:42:29.276 --> 01:42:30.544

01:42:37.818 --> 01:42:40.621
PROPOSAL TO OUR COMMITTEE.

01:42:40.687 --> 01:42:46.260
THE FORMAL PROPOSAL FOR MONEY.

01:42:46.326 --> 01:42:48.529

THAT ARE AVAILABLE AS A PROPOSAL

01:42:49.696 --> 01:42:50.597
REAL QUICK YOU HAVE A BUDGET

01:42:50.664 --> 01:42:51.832
PROPOSAL THAT SOME CLARIFICATION

01:42:51.899 --> 01:42:52.900
WE DO HAVE A BUDGET PROPOSAL FOR

01:42:52.966 --> 01:42:53.567
THE OKAY THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO

01:42:53.634 --> 01:42:54.668
THE BACK FILL I'M WE TALKED

01:42:54.735 --> 01:42:56.103
ABOUT EARLIER ABOUT THE DNA FUND

01:42:56.169 --> 01:42:57.170
HAS BEEN STRUGGLING.

01:42:57.237 --> 01:42:58.472
AND IT WAS A PROPOSAL THAT WE

01:42:58.539 --> 01:42:59.106
BROUGHT TO THE COMMITTEE LAST

01:42:59.172 --> 01:43:00.340
YEAR -- SO THIS YEAR THE

01:43:00.407 --> 01:43:01.808
PROPOSAL IS TO EXTEND THAT FOR

01:43:01.875 --> 01:43:03.510
ONE MORE YEAR -- BUT WE ARE

01:43:03.577 --> 01:43:05.045
SEEKING A LONG TERM SOLUTION --

01:43:05.112 --> 01:43:06.213
SO IN WORKING WITH THE

01:43:06.280 --> 01:43:07.347
ADMINISTRATION AND WITH THAT THE

01:43:07.414 --> 01:43:08.849
LEGISLATURE WE'RE HOPEFUL WE CAN

01:43:08.916 --> 01:43:10.250
GET TO A LONG TERM SOLUTION BUT

01:43:10.317 --> 01:43:11.051
IN THE MEANTIME WE HAVE A

01:43:11.118 --> 01:43:12.886
PROPOSAL THAT CARRIES OUT THE

01:43:12.953 --> 01:43:15.155
CURRENT SOLUTION ONE MORE YEAR.

01:43:15.222 --> 01:43:15.789
YEAH.

01:43:15.856 --> 01:43:17.524
YOU THINK THAT THE THE THE

01:43:17.591 --> 01:43:19.192
THERE'S ABOUT A DOZEN SENATORS

01:43:19.259 --> 01:43:20.661
ARE PROPOSING THE ADDITIONAL

01:43:20.727 --> 01:43:21.929
MONEY FOR THE PREVENTION

01:43:21.995 --> 01:43:23.564
EDUCATION.

01:43:23.630 --> 01:43:28.068
DO YOU THINK -- THAT WOULD --

01:43:28.135 --> 01:43:29.202
HELP FACILITATE HOW WHAT IMPACT

01:43:29.269 --> 01:43:29.870
YOU THINK THAT WOULD HAVE WELL I

01:43:29.937 --> 01:43:30.437
THINK WHAT WHAT WE HAVE NOT

01:43:30.504 --> 01:43:32.539
GIVEN AS MUCH FOCUS TO IS AN

01:43:32.606 --> 01:43:35.475
IMMENSE ON OTHER THINGS -- AS I

01:43:35.542 --> 01:43:36.310
SAID -- MONEY OUT.

01:43:36.376 --> 01:43:39.179
ACTUALLY SIXTY SEVEN THOUSAND

01:43:39.246 --> 01:43:39.846
DOLLARS.

01:43:39.913 --> 01:43:41.214
IS ACTUALLY WHAT'S IN THE BUDGET

01:43:41.281 --> 01:43:42.883
FOR THAT RIGHT NOW IN THE STATE

01:43:42.950 --> 01:43:45.986
BUDGET THAT'S FANTASTIC -- I

01:43:46.053 --> 01:43:48.221
WELL IT'S BETTER THAN THAN WHAT

01:43:48.288 --> 01:43:50.490
WE'VE BEEN ZERO YES SIR BUT AYE

01:43:50.557 --> 01:43:52.125
AYES SHARED EARLIER THAT I WAS A

01:43:52.192 --> 01:43:55.062
RAPE CRISIS VOLUNTEER IN

01:43:55.128 --> 01:43:56.763
NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX AND AND IT

01:43:56.830 --> 01:43:57.898
WAS TERRIBLE.

01:43:57.965 --> 01:44:01.568
THEN FOR VICTIMS AND A AND SO IN

01:44:01.635 --> 01:44:03.003
AYE WE'RE ALSO GETTING READY FOR

01:44:03.070 --> 01:44:04.705
VICTIMS RIGHTS WEEK NEXT WEEK

01:44:04.771 --> 01:44:06.239
AND SO I'VE REVIEWED ALL OF THE

01:44:06.306 --> 01:44:07.774
LEGISLATURE A VICTIM SERVICES

01:44:07.841 --> 01:44:08.909
AND THE FIRST.

01:44:08.976 --> 01:44:10.711
VICTIMS RIGHTS LEGISLATION WAS

01:44:10.777 --> 01:44:13.947
FOR SEXUAL ASSAULT SURVIVORS IN

01:44:14.014 --> 01:44:14.581
NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE AND WE'RE

01:44:14.648 --> 01:44:15.315
STILL HERE.

01:44:15.382 --> 01:44:16.917
SO WE'RE I THINK THE FIFTY

01:44:16.984 --> 01:44:19.319
MILLION OR THE REQUEST -- FOR

01:44:19.386 --> 01:44:20.921
PREVENTION IN AND OUT REACH

01:44:20.988 --> 01:44:22.556
EDUCATION IS CRITICAL BECAUSE

01:44:22.623 --> 01:44:24.257
WHAT WE STILL SEE CONSISTENTLY

01:44:24.324 --> 01:44:25.158
IS THAT.

01:44:25.225 --> 01:44:29.496
ABOUT -- 5260% OF THE CASES

01:44:29.563 --> 01:44:29.796
[inaudible]

01:44:29.863 --> 01:44:30.631
ARE UNREPORTED.

01:44:30.697 --> 01:44:32.633
WHICH OF FOR A LOT OF REASONS

01:44:32.699 --> 01:44:35.302
AND AND SOME OF WHICH IS THAT --

01:44:35.369 --> 01:44:37.437
PEOPLE JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND

01:44:37.504 --> 01:44:39.139
WHAT THE SYSTEM IS ARE THEY

01:44:39.206 --> 01:44:40.474
DON'T WANT TO BECOME PUBLIC

01:44:40.540 --> 01:44:41.708
ABOUT IT AND WE'VE GOT THE

01:44:41.775 --> 01:44:42.843
LEGISLATURE'S CREATE A LOT OF

01:44:42.909 --> 01:44:45.245
LAWS TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO REMAIN.

01:44:45.312 --> 01:44:47.381
ANONYMOUS IN THE SYSTEM SO I

01:44:47.447 --> 01:44:49.182
THINK THAT IF WE CAN INCREASE.

01:44:49.249 --> 01:44:51.351
THE NUMBER BECAUSE THROUGH

01:44:51.418 --> 01:44:55.322
EDUCATION AND THROUGH -- MORE --

01:44:55.389 --> 01:44:57.257
INDIVIDUALIZED ENGAGEMENT WITH

01:44:57.324 --> 01:44:59.426
SURVIVORS THAT WE WILL INCREASE

01:44:59.493 --> 01:45:01.061
THE NUMBER REPORT.

01:45:01.128 --> 01:45:03.196
I ALSO THINK THAT -- THERE'S A

01:45:03.263 --> 01:45:05.499
HUGE AMOUNT OF EDUCATION FOR

01:45:05.565 --> 01:45:07.701
YOUNG PEOPLE TEEN DATING

01:45:07.768 --> 01:45:09.202
VIOLENCE IS ON A RISE.

01:45:09.269 --> 01:45:11.872
AND THERE'S A LOT OF OF ISSUES

01:45:11.938 --> 01:45:13.674
THAT ARE GOING ON THAT THAT

01:45:13.740 --> 01:45:15.308
WE'RE TRYING. TO TO YOU KNOW GO

01:45:15.375 --> 01:45:17.711
LOWER AND LOWER IN THE AGE GROUP --

01:45:17.778 --> 01:45:21.048
TO EDUCATE AND TO HELP TRY TO

01:45:21.114 --> 01:45:22.716
PREVENT [inaudible]

01:45:22.783 --> 01:45:23.950
THIS MORNING.

01:45:24.017 --> 01:45:24.818
SO IT WOULD GO FOR THAT I THINK

01:45:24.885 --> 01:45:25.552
IT'S REALLY CRITICAL AND YOU

01:45:25.619 --> 01:45:27.587
KNOW THE SAD ASIDE FROM THE

01:45:27.654 --> 01:45:28.955
DISTANT DISTRICT THAT HASN'T

01:45:29.022 --> 01:45:30.257
REALLY CHANGED VERY MUCH.

01:45:30.323 --> 01:45:32.059
SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX WHEN

01:45:32.125 --> 01:45:33.527
I FIRST BECAME INVOLVED ABOUT

01:45:33.593 --> 01:45:35.529
NOT REPORTING WHAT WE ALSO KNOW

01:45:35.595 --> 01:45:37.831
IS THAT ONLY ABOUT 5% OF CASES

01:45:37.898 --> 01:45:39.499
THAT ARE REPORTED.

01:45:39.566 --> 01:45:40.467
END UP IN A COURT ROOM.

01:45:40.534 --> 01:45:42.569
SO WE'VE GOT WORK TO DO IN WITH

01:45:42.636 --> 01:45:44.538
MY OWN PROFESSION ABOUT THAT AND

01:45:44.604 --> 01:45:46.540
WE'RE WE ARE EMBARKING ON THAT

01:45:46.606 --> 01:45:47.708
TO TRY TO EDUCATE PROSECUTORS

01:45:47.774 --> 01:45:49.443
ABOUT.

01:45:49.509 --> 01:45:51.545
THE PROVABILITY OF CASES AND

01:45:51.611 --> 01:45:52.179
THINGS LIKE THAT TO MAKE SURE

01:45:52.245 --> 01:45:53.780
THAT.

01:45:53.847 --> 01:45:57.084
VICTIMS TO HAVE THEIR JUSTICE.

01:45:57.150 --> 01:45:58.351
THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT

ASKING ABOUT -- THE BUDGET AND

01:46:02.155 --> 01:46:04.624
HOW TO HELP OUT -- I THINK

01:46:04.691 --> 01:46:07.027
THERE'S A LOT OF A LOT OF

01:46:07.094 --> 01:46:07.961
INTEREST FROM THE MEMBERS UP ON

01:46:08.028 --> 01:46:10.597

BUT ALSO -- THE BUDGET **** I

01:46:29.182 --> 01:46:30.383
WOULD GO WITH IT TO MAKE SURE

01:46:30.450 --> 01:46:31.785
THAT WE TEST ALL.

01:46:31.852 --> 01:46:33.620
ALL THE KIDS WE'VE HAD TESTIMONY

01:46:33.687 --> 01:46:35.322
FOR ME TO THE DISTRICT

01:46:35.388 --> 01:46:38.458
ATTORNEY'S OFFICES -- ABOUT THAT.

AND BEST PRACTICES MAY BE YOU

01:46:42.629 --> 01:46:44.030
KNOW I'VE READ SOME STORIES WERE.

01:46:44.097 --> 01:46:46.133
AT KIDS BEEN SITTING IN EVIDENCE

01:46:46.199 --> 01:46:48.769
FOR YEARS ALMOST YOU KNOW NINE

01:46:48.835 --> 01:46:50.604
TEN YEARS SOMETIMES -- IN

01:46:50.670 --> 01:46:52.572
MEANWHILE THERE'S OTHER VICTIMS

01:46:52.639 --> 01:46:54.107
DURING THAT TIME AND YOU KNOW

01:46:54.174 --> 01:46:56.243
WHAT WE CAN DO TO DO THAT -- I

01:46:56.309 --> 01:46:56.843
WOULD DO APPRECIATE FORM OF

01:46:56.910 --> 01:46:59.446
JUSTICE TALKING ABOUT SPEAKING

01:46:59.513 --> 01:47:00.914
ABOUT AGREEING WITH THE AUDITS.

01:47:00.981 --> 01:47:02.716
AND THE NEED TO FOCUS ON THE

01:47:02.783 --> 01:47:05.385
OUTCOMES.

01:47:05.452 --> 01:47:07.754
RIGHT -- AND SO I WAS JUST

01:47:07.821 --> 01:47:08.889
WONDERING FROM DOJ'S POINT OF

01:47:08.955 --> 01:47:09.723
VIEW.

01:47:09.790 --> 01:47:11.458
WHAT MORE CAN WE DO TO HELP GET

01:47:11.525 --> 01:47:12.692
THOSE CASE OUTCOMES YOU HAD

01:47:12.759 --> 01:47:14.761
MENTIONED -- YOU KNOW YOU GUYS

01:47:14.828 --> 01:47:16.329
SENT OUT A BULLETIN.

01:47:16.396 --> 01:47:17.597
OF WHAT YOU EXPECT FROM EACH OF

01:47:17.664 --> 01:47:19.132
LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES BUT SIR

01:47:19.199 --> 01:47:20.567
ANYTHING MORE THAT WE SHOULD BE

01:47:20.634 --> 01:47:22.736
LOOKING AT IN TERMS OF DOJ

01:47:22.803 --> 01:47:24.571
TRYING TO GET THIS CASE HOW COME

01:47:24.638 --> 01:47:25.872
INFORMATION THAT WE NEED OR IS

01:47:25.939 --> 01:47:26.907
THIS JUST HAS TO BE A

01:47:26.973 --> 01:47:28.375
LEGISLATIVE MANDATE AND THAT'S

01:47:28.441 --> 01:47:29.609
WHERE WE'RE AT WELL.

01:47:29.676 --> 01:47:30.911
UNTIL THERE'S A LEGISLATIVE

01:47:30.977 --> 01:47:31.778
MANDATEIT'S GOING TO BE A

01:47:31.845 --> 01:47:34.181
MATTER OF ENFORCEABILITY AND WE

01:47:34.247 --> 01:47:36.616
JUST DON'T HAVE -- RIGHT NOW THE

01:47:36.683 --> 01:47:38.919
ENFORCEABILITY TO GO OUT AND SAY

01:47:38.985 --> 01:47:40.120
YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW A MEMORANDUM

01:47:40.187 --> 01:47:41.388
OF UNDERSTANDING.

01:47:41.454 --> 01:47:43.390
SO THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY

01:47:43.456 --> 01:47:47.093
WE AGREE THAT THIS -- MANDATE --

01:47:47.160 --> 01:47:49.563
TO HAVE CHOP ENTRY IS CRUCIAL

01:47:49.629 --> 01:47:51.932
BECAUSE THAT DOES GIVE -- LAW

01:47:51.998 --> 01:47:54.334
ENFORCEMENT SOME GUIDANCE AS TO

01:47:54.401 --> 01:47:56.002
WHAT THEY NEED TO BE DOING AND

01:47:56.069 --> 01:47:56.636
TAKES THE BURDEN THEY'LL STILL

01:47:56.703 --> 01:47:58.238
BE AN OUTRAGE BURDEN FOR US TO

01:47:58.305 --> 01:47:59.773
GO OUT THERE AND MAKE SURE THAT

01:47:59.840 --> 01:48:01.608
THE DATABASE IS BEING UPDATED --

01:48:01.675 --> 01:48:02.909
BUT IT WON'T BE A SIGNIFICANT

01:48:02.976 --> 01:48:04.311
BECAUSETHERE WILL BE A MANDATE

01:48:04.377 --> 01:48:05.846
FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT TO ENTER IT.

01:48:05.912 --> 01:48:07.347
AND I THINK THAT'S I THINK

01:48:07.414 --> 01:48:09.783
THAT'S ULTIMATELY WHAT WE

01:48:09.850 --> 01:48:11.852
DEFINITELY SUPPORT.

01:48:11.918 --> 01:48:12.485
GOT IT SIR MANDATING THAT THEIR

01:48:12.552 --> 01:48:13.119
REPORTS OF THIS INFORMATION IN

01:48:13.186 --> 01:48:14.387
THE DATABASES ARE THEY JUST NOT

01:48:14.454 --> 01:48:19.292
DOING IT -- RELATED SPECIFICALLY

01:48:19.359 --> 01:48:19.893
TO SEXUAL ASSAULT I WANNA MAKE

01:48:19.960 --> 01:48:21.127
THAT CLEAR YEAH.

01:48:21.194 --> 01:48:21.728
WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING AT OUTCOME

01:48:21.795 --> 01:48:23.330
REPORTING FOR SEXUAL ASSAULT IS

01:48:23.396 --> 01:48:24.731
ALREADY MANDATED THAT THEY TRACK

01:48:24.798 --> 01:48:27.267
THE KIDS NOW -- IN THE SAFETY

01:48:27.334 --> 01:48:30.003
DATABASE -- MEETING WITH A

01:48:30.070 --> 01:48:30.537
HUNDRED TWENTY DAYS THEY

01:48:30.604 --> 01:48:31.738
ACTUALLY PUT THE INFORMATION IN

01:48:31.805 --> 01:48:33.039
THERE SO THAT WE CAN HAVE THAT

01:48:33.106 --> 01:48:34.808
PERSPECTIVE LOOK AT WHAT'S OUT

01:48:34.875 --> 01:48:38.044
THERE -- AND A FEW OTHER DATA

01:48:38.111 --> 01:48:40.347
POINTS THAT THAT WILL HOPEFULLY

01:48:40.413 --> 01:48:42.349
BE ABLE TO REPORT ON THIS YEAR --

01:48:42.415 --> 01:48:44.351
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT ONCE

01:48:44.417 --> 01:48:45.886
THE NOTIFICATION HAS BEEN MADE

01:48:45.952 --> 01:48:47.354
IF WE'RE IF WE'RE LOOKING AT

01:48:47.420 --> 01:48:50.156
THIS IS KIND OF A SPLIT PROCESS.

01:48:50.223 --> 01:48:51.591
THE LABORATORIES RUN THE

01:48:51.658 --> 01:48:54.327
EVIDENCE GET A DNA PROFILE GET

01:48:54.394 --> 01:48:55.896
IT INTO THE SYSTEM AND GET THE

01:48:55.962 --> 01:48:57.297
HIT NOTIFICATION OUT AND WE HAVE

01:48:57.364 --> 01:48:58.231
A LOT OF HIT NOTIFICATIONS IN

01:48:58.298 --> 01:48:59.499
CALIFORNIA SINCE THE DATABASE

01:48:59.566 --> 01:49:01.701
INCREASED SO MUCH IN SIZE.

01:49:01.768 --> 01:49:02.736
WE HAVE THE FOURTH LARGEST

01:49:02.802 --> 01:49:03.904
DATABASE IN THE WORLD.

01:49:03.970 --> 01:49:05.839
SO IT'S VERY IT'S A VERY LARGE

01:49:05.906 --> 01:49:08.174
DATA -- SO AS OUR HIT

01:49:08.241 --> 01:49:10.310
NOTIFICATIONS INCREASE WE STOP

01:49:10.377 --> 01:49:11.111
AT SENDING OUT THE HIT

01:49:11.177 --> 01:49:12.445
NOTIFICATION AND NOW WE'RE

01:49:12.512 --> 01:49:14.948
TALKING ABOUT IS THE OUTCOMES.

01:49:15.015 --> 01:49:17.150
WASN'T INVESTIGATED WAS ITS

01:49:17.217 --> 01:49:19.219
PROSECUTED WAS IT A JUDICATA WAS

01:49:19.286 --> 01:49:20.987
THERE AN EXONERATION THOSE ARE

01:49:21.054 --> 01:49:22.989
THE THINGS THAT WE'RE ASKING --

01:49:23.056 --> 01:49:24.557
TO BE TRACKED AND THAT WE WERE

01:49:24.624 --> 01:49:27.160
TRYING TO ASK NICELY THROUGH THE

01:49:27.227 --> 01:49:27.861
MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING

01:49:27.928 --> 01:49:29.663
PROCESS BUT WE ALSO UNDERSTAND

01:49:29.729 --> 01:49:30.864
THAT LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS

01:49:30.931 --> 01:49:32.198
THEIR OWN RESOURCE ISSUES.

01:49:32.265 --> 01:49:34.901
BUT AS FAR AS GETTING THAT

01:49:34.968 --> 01:49:38.939
INFORMATION AND WE FEEL THAT'S

01:49:39.005 --> 01:49:39.572
THE WAY THAT WE'RE GOING TO GET

01:49:39.639 --> 01:49:40.507
IT.

01:49:40.573 --> 01:49:41.107
YEAH AND I THINK HEARD SEVERAL

01:49:41.174 --> 01:49:41.675
PEOPLE TALK ABOUT TESTIMONY

01:49:41.741 --> 01:49:42.909
ABOUT THE OUTCOMES WHAT THAT

01:49:42.976 --> 01:49:44.711
ACTUALLY MEANS OR TESTING EVERY

01:49:44.778 --> 01:49:46.413
KID FOR OTHER CASES -- BUT THE

01:49:46.479 --> 01:49:48.214
OUTCOME INFORMATION I THINK ALSO

01:49:48.281 --> 01:49:51.084
WILL LET US KNOW BETWEEN EACH

01:49:51.151 --> 01:49:52.419
LAW ENFORCEMENT OR PERHAPS A

01:49:52.485 --> 01:49:53.820
VERY EVERY COUNTY -- WHY THEY'RE

01:49:53.887 --> 01:49:55.355
NOT TESTING THINGS IT WAS IT WAS

01:49:55.422 --> 01:49:56.957
CONSENSUAL BUT DOES THAT

01:49:57.023 --> 01:49:58.525
ACTUALLY STILL FACTOR INTO

01:49:58.591 --> 01:49:59.926
ANOTHER CASE AND I THINK MISS

01:49:59.993 --> 01:50:01.594
AMOUNT YOU TALKED ABOUT?

01:50:01.661 --> 01:50:03.096
SOME OF THAT -- AS WELL AND I'M

01:50:03.163 --> 01:50:04.197
STERN FIGURE FROM THE AGES

01:50:04.264 --> 01:50:05.966
PERSPECTIVE HOW DO WE MOVE THAT

01:50:06.032 --> 01:50:08.101
ALONG SHORT OF DOING -- A

01:50:08.168 --> 01:50:11.037
LEGISLATIVE MANDATE YOU'RE

01:50:11.104 --> 01:50:12.005
SAYING THE LEGISLATIVE MANDATE

01:50:12.072 --> 01:50:15.809
IS CAN I GET SAYS THERE BUT FOR

01:50:15.875 --> 01:50:16.176
DOJ'S.

01:50:16.242 --> 01:50:17.177
POINT YOU'RE TRYING.

01:50:17.243 --> 01:50:22.282
I GUESS FOR YES -- YEAH AND THE

01:50:22.349 --> 01:50:24.884
WHY A OR IF A LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:50:24.951 --> 01:50:27.354
AGENCY DID NOT TURN A SEXUAL

01:50:27.420 --> 01:50:28.588
ASSAULT EVIDENCE KIT INTO A

01:50:28.655 --> 01:50:30.357
LABORATORY IS SOMETHING THAT IS

01:50:30.423 --> 01:50:33.426
TRACKED IN THE SAFETY DATABASE.

01:50:33.493 --> 01:50:34.060
WHETHER OR NOT IT ACTUALLY WENT

01:50:34.127 --> 01:50:35.628
TO A CRIME LAB -- SO THAT'S

01:50:35.695 --> 01:50:36.963
SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD BE ABLE

01:50:37.030 --> 01:50:39.165
TO REPORT ON IN THE SAFETY

01:50:39.232 --> 01:50:41.368
REPORT TO THIS YEAR -- THE

01:50:41.434 --> 01:50:42.669
OUTCOME INFORMATION AS TO WHY IT

01:50:42.736 --> 01:50:45.672
WAS INVESTIGATED -- THAT.

01:50:45.739 --> 01:50:47.240
MAY OR MAY NOT BE ENTERED AT

01:50:47.307 --> 01:50:50.477
THIS POINT YOU KNOW -- THE WISE --

01:50:50.543 --> 01:50:53.013
IT'S MOSTLY JUST DID THIS LEAD

01:50:53.079 --> 01:50:54.347
TO AN INVESTIGATION DID THIS

01:50:54.414 --> 01:50:55.515
LEAD TO A PROSECUTION.

01:50:55.582 --> 01:50:57.450
SO WITH THE SAFETY DATABASE CAN

01:50:57.517 --> 01:51:00.387
WE ASCERTAIN HOW MANY KIDS HAVE

01:51:00.453 --> 01:51:02.122
BEEN SITTING THERE FOR X. AMOUNT

01:51:02.188 --> 01:51:03.857
OF YEARS OF SAFE WE WANTED TO

01:51:03.923 --> 01:51:05.358
RUN REPORT AND SAY HOW MANY KIDS

01:51:05.425 --> 01:51:06.626
HAVE BEEN.

01:51:06.693 --> 01:51:09.529
LEFT FOR EIGHT PLUS YEARS IS

01:51:09.596 --> 01:51:10.397
THAT SOMETHING THAT THE DATABASE

01:51:10.463 --> 01:51:11.865
CAN PROVIDER NOW ONLY FROM

01:51:11.931 --> 01:51:13.600

01:51:16.269 --> 01:51:18.738
WAS LEGISLATION IN FUNDING THAT

01:51:18.805 --> 01:51:20.507
WAS PASSED LAST YEAR ALSO --

01:51:20.573 --> 01:51:22.509
THAT GAVE MONEY TO LOCAL LAW

01:51:22.575 --> 01:51:23.576
ENFORCEMENT TO GO IN AND DO

01:51:23.643 --> 01:51:26.012

01:51:26.713 --> 01:51:27.180

01:54:55.922 --> 01:54:56.923
DNA EVIDENCE CONTAINED IN RATE

01:54:56.990 --> 01:54:59.225
CUTS IS A VERY POWERFUL TOOL FOR

01:54:59.292 --> 01:55:01.194
LAW ENFORCEMENT. TO SOLVE AND

01:55:01.261 --> 01:55:03.096
PREVENT CRIME.

01:55:03.162 --> 01:55:04.764
WHEN TESTED IT CAN IDENTIFY

01:55:04.831 --> 01:55:06.332
UNKNOWN OFFENDERS THEY CAN LINK

01:55:06.399 --> 01:55:07.567
CRIMES TOGETHER OF COURSE THIS

01:55:07.634 --> 01:55:09.269
IS HOW WE FIND A SERIAL RAPIST

01:55:09.335 --> 01:55:10.203
AND?

01:55:10.270 --> 01:55:11.137
IT CAN ALSO EXONERATE THE

01:55:11.204 --> 01:55:12.872
WRONGFULLY CONVICTED AND THAT

01:55:12.939 --> 01:55:14.073
HAS HAPPENED BY TESTING RIGHT

01:55:14.140 --> 01:55:18.011
KIDS.

01:55:18.077 --> 01:55:19.212
NEWS WHEN I READ A FEW RAPE KIT

01:55:19.279 --> 01:55:19.979
TESTING SUCCESS HEADLINES FROM

01:55:20.046 --> 01:55:21.281
ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

01:55:21.347 --> 01:55:22.749
FROM THIS LAST YEAR.

01:55:22.815 --> 01:55:24.584
MEMPHIS MAN CONVICTED IN TWO

01:55:24.651 --> 01:55:25.885
THOUSAND RAPE AFTER DNA LINKED

01:55:25.952 --> 01:55:27.120
HIM TO ATTACK.

01:55:27.186 --> 01:55:28.388
TESTING OF TWO THOUSAND TWELVE

01:55:28.454 --> 01:55:29.856
SEXUAL ASSAULT KIT LEADS TO

01:55:29.922 --> 01:55:31.524
ORGAN RAPE CONVICTION.

01:55:31.591 --> 01:55:33.159
ARREST MADE IN HOC I THINK IT'S

01:55:33.226 --> 01:55:35.395
HOPE COUNTY RAPE KIDNAPPING COLD

01:55:35.461 --> 01:55:37.363
CASE AFTER REAP CA IS SENT FOR

01:55:37.430 --> 01:55:38.431
DNA TESTING.

01:55:38.498 --> 01:55:39.932
SIMILAR HEADLINES ARE PUBLISHED

01:55:39.999 --> 01:55:42.068
EVERY SINGLE DAY AND I WANT TO

01:55:42.135 --> 01:55:44.070
JUST HIGHLIGHT AGAIN THE TRAGIC

01:55:44.137 --> 01:55:46.639
NORTH CAROLINA CASE WHERE.

01:55:46.706 --> 01:55:48.207
THE MURDER AND RAPE OF A

01:55:48.274 --> 01:55:48.775
THIRTEEN YEAR OLD GIRL COULD

01:55:48.841 --> 01:55:50.109
HAVE BEEN PREVENTED.

01:55:50.176 --> 01:55:53.012
AFRICA A RAPE KIT -- FAULT HAD

01:55:53.079 --> 01:55:55.782
BEEN FOLLOW UP FOLLOWED UP ON

01:55:55.848 --> 01:55:57.050
CITY SORRY.

01:55:57.116 --> 01:55:58.785
AND ALSO JUST TO MENTION I AM

01:55:58.851 --> 01:55:59.552
JUST A FOLLOW UP ON WHAT DO

01:55:59.619 --> 01:56:01.554
MALLEY SAID THERE HAS BEEN A

01:56:01.621 --> 01:56:03.289
RECENT CASE TESTS -- WHERE RICK

01:56:03.356 --> 01:56:05.825
IT WAS TESTED AND A STRANGER

01:56:05.892 --> 01:56:07.427
RAPE WAS SOLVED BECAUSE AN

01:56:07.493 --> 01:56:08.828
ACQUAINTANCE RAPE?

01:56:08.895 --> 01:56:11.164
WAS IN THE SYSTEM SO THEY DIDN'T

01:56:11.230 --> 01:56:12.498
HAVE A LEAD.

01:56:12.565 --> 01:56:14.300
ON THE STRANGER RAPE THE

01:56:14.367 --> 01:56:15.335
PERSON'S DNA WAS NOT THE

01:56:15.401 --> 01:56:16.903
DATABASE BECAUSE THE TWO CASES

01:56:16.969 --> 01:56:18.438
CONNECTED AND THEY COULD GO BACK

01:56:18.504 --> 01:56:19.906
TO THE QUEEN'S RAPE FILE AND

01:56:19.972 --> 01:56:22.075
THEY GOT A NAME THEY WERE ABLE

01:56:22.141 --> 01:56:23.476
TO SOLVE THAT CRIME.

01:56:23.543 --> 01:56:24.744
THE DETROIT WHERE THEY'VE TESTED

01:56:24.811 --> 01:56:26.079
MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND RAPE KITS

01:56:26.145 --> 01:56:28.748
THEY HAVE DISCOVERED MORE THAN

01:56:28.815 --> 01:56:30.016
EIGHT HUNDRED SERIAL OFFENDERS

01:56:30.083 --> 01:56:31.451
WHO HAVE COMMITTED CRIMES.

01:56:31.517 --> 01:56:33.720
ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND FORTY

01:56:33.786 --> 01:56:35.822
STATES AND WASHINGTON DC LIKE MY

01:56:35.888 --> 01:56:37.123
ALL KINDS OF CRIMES AND THEY

01:56:37.190 --> 01:56:39.025
COMMIT ALL KINDS OF RAPE AGAINST

01:56:39.092 --> 01:56:39.625
PEOPLE THEY KNOWN PEOPLE THEY

01:56:39.692 --> 01:56:40.660
DON'T KNOW.

01:56:40.727 --> 01:56:42.895
AND CLEVELAND IS IDENTIFIED MORE

01:56:42.962 --> 01:56:43.496
THAN EIGHT HUNDRED ZERO MIGHT

01:56:43.563 --> 01:56:44.630
PASS AS WELL.

01:56:44.697 --> 01:56:45.932
IN ADDITION RESEARCH OUT OF THE

01:56:45.998 --> 01:56:47.233
BEGUN CENTER AT CASE WESTERN

01:56:47.300 --> 01:56:49.369
UNIVERSITY IN CUYAHOGA COUNTY

01:56:49.435 --> 01:56:50.603
FOUND THAT SERIAL RAPISTS ARE.

01:56:50.670 --> 01:56:51.404
FAR MORE COMMON THAN WE

01:56:51.471 --> 01:56:52.905
PREVIOUSLY KNEW AND THEIR

01:56:52.972 --> 01:56:54.307
RECOMMENDATION IS NOW THAT LAW

01:56:54.374 --> 01:56:55.708
ENFORCEMENT LOOK AT EVERY SINGLE

01:56:55.775 --> 01:56:57.310
RATE CASE AS A POSSIBLE SERIAL

01:56:57.377 --> 01:56:58.878
CASE.

01:56:58.945 --> 01:56:59.479
SO THE VALUE OF TESTING RATE

01:56:59.545 --> 01:57:02.115
CUTS IS UNDENIABLE IN THE NEED

01:57:02.181 --> 01:57:03.983
FOR REFORM IS ALSO UNDENIABLE.

01:57:04.050 --> 01:57:05.218
WE HAVE PLENTY OF EVIDENCE NOW

01:57:05.284 --> 01:57:06.386
THAT TESTING EVERYTHING OVER IT

01:57:06.452 --> 01:57:07.854
IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO AND THE

01:57:07.920 --> 01:57:08.855
THING IS THIS IS A FIXABLE

01:57:08.921 --> 01:57:12.425
PROBLEM WE ACTUALLY CAN FIX THIS.

01:57:12.492 --> 01:57:13.860
BUT IT NEEDS TO BE LEGISLATED.

01:57:13.926 --> 01:57:15.528
SO YOU MAY BE ASKING WHAT DOES

01:57:15.595 --> 01:57:16.629
COMPREHENSIVE RATE CAN REFORM

01:57:16.696 --> 01:57:17.997
LOOK LIKE WELL CHOICE FOR HER

01:57:18.064 --> 01:57:19.632
DOES DEVELOP SIX ESSENTIAL

01:57:19.699 --> 01:57:22.168
PILLARS FOR RATE CAN'T REFORM

01:57:22.235 --> 01:57:23.536
ONE IS AN ANNUAL STATEWIDE

01:57:23.603 --> 01:57:24.737
INVENTORY.

01:57:24.804 --> 01:57:27.840
COUNTING ALL UNTESTED KIDS ON A

01:57:27.907 --> 01:57:29.475
RECURRING BASIS.

01:57:29.542 --> 01:57:30.743
REQUIRING THE SUBMISSION OF ALL

01:57:30.810 --> 01:57:33.679
PREVIOUSLY UNTESTED CATS THAT

01:57:33.746 --> 01:57:35.448
ARE IDENTIFIED IN THE AUDIT --

01:57:35.515 --> 01:57:36.382
AND MAKING SURE THAT THOSE ARE

01:57:36.449 --> 01:57:38.317
SENT TO A LAB AND TESTED IN A

01:57:38.384 --> 01:57:40.686
TIMELY MANNER -- I WANT TO MAKE

01:57:40.753 --> 01:57:41.721
ONE NOTE THAT THAT DOES NOT

01:57:41.788 --> 01:57:42.989
INCLUDE THE ANONYMOUS KIDS OR

01:57:43.055 --> 01:57:45.024
THE ON REPORTED KIDS WHICH IS A

01:57:45.091 --> 01:57:46.559
WHOLE OTHER TOPIC BUT YOU KNOW

01:57:46.626 --> 01:57:48.528
CASUALLY -- SURVIVORS THEY HAVE

01:57:48.594 --> 01:57:49.896
THE RIGHT TO HAVE EVIDENCE

01:57:49.962 --> 01:57:51.197
COLLECTED AND NOT NECESSARILY

01:57:51.264 --> 01:57:52.231
PARTICIPATE IN THE CRIMINAL

01:57:52.298 --> 01:57:53.933
JUSTICE PROCESS SO THAT KßT

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:55.435
CAN JUST BE HELD UNTIL THEY

01:57:55.501 --> 01:57:57.069
MAYBE MAKE THAT DECISION TO GO

01:57:57.136 --> 01:57:57.870
FOR IT SO.

01:57:57.937 --> 01:57:59.605
WE DO NOT SUGGEST TESTING THOSE

01:57:59.672 --> 01:58:01.274
KIDS WITHOUT SURVIVOR PERMISSION.

01:58:01.340 --> 01:58:02.241
SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT RAPE KITS

01:58:02.308 --> 01:58:04.243
THAT ARE CONNECTED TO A REPORTED

01:58:04.310 --> 01:58:05.244
CRIME.

01:58:05.311 --> 01:58:06.446
THE MANDATORY TESTING OF NEW

01:58:06.512 --> 01:58:08.581
KIDS REQUIRING LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:58:08.648 --> 01:58:09.916
TO SUBMIT ALL CATS THAT ARE

01:58:09.982 --> 01:58:12.318
CONNECTED TO REPORTED CRIME FOR

01:58:12.385 --> 01:58:14.454
TESTING WITH IN A TIMELY MANNER --

01:58:14.520 --> 01:58:17.590
WE SUGGEST WITHIN SEVEN DAYS AND

01:58:17.657 --> 01:58:19.325
ALSO MAKE SURE THAT.

01:58:19.392 --> 01:58:21.828
THERE ARE TIME LINES THROUGHOUT

01:58:21.894 --> 01:58:24.030
THE PROCESS OF FOR EXAMPLE.

01:58:24.096 --> 01:58:25.832
WHEN A KID IS COLLECTED AT?

01:58:25.898 --> 01:58:28.267
THE MEDICAL CENTER OR EVEN

01:58:28.334 --> 01:58:29.836
SOMETIMES A A RATE TREATMENT

01:58:29.902 --> 01:58:31.871
CENTER -- TO MANDATE THAT THOSE

01:58:31.938 --> 01:58:33.072
KIDS ACTUALLY GET PICKED UP

01:58:33.139 --> 01:58:34.340
BECAUSE SOMETIMES THEY ACT THEY

01:58:34.407 --> 01:58:35.875
WILL SIT AT THE HOSPITAL NEVER

01:58:35.942 --> 01:58:37.243
BE PICKED UP FROM THE HOSPITAL.

01:58:37.310 --> 01:58:39.612
SO IN MANDATE FORTY EIGHT HOURS

01:58:39.679 --> 01:58:40.780
FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT TO PICK UP

01:58:40.847 --> 01:58:42.882
THE CAT FROMTHE HOSPITAL. SEVEN

01:58:42.949 --> 01:58:44.717
DAYS TO SEND IT ON TO A LAB FOR

01:58:44.784 --> 01:58:45.284
TESTING AND THEN WE SUGGEST

01:58:45.351 --> 01:58:47.920
LAGGED LAB TURN AROUND TIMES FOR

01:58:47.987 --> 01:58:49.322
TESTING AS WELL.

01:58:49.388 --> 01:58:51.090
TRACKING SYSTEMS TO ENSURE THAT

01:58:51.157 --> 01:58:52.859
THE RAPE KITS ARE TRACKED FROM

01:58:52.925 --> 01:58:54.527
POINT A TO POINT C. SO THIS

01:58:54.594 --> 01:58:57.263
WOULD INCLUDE -- YOU KNOW WHAT

01:58:57.330 --> 01:58:59.298
WHOEVER BUYS THE CAT IF IT'S THE

01:58:59.365 --> 01:59:00.766
HOSPITAL OR THE STATE LAB YOU

01:59:00.833 --> 01:59:02.201
KNOW SUB A BAR CODE ON THAT.

01:59:02.268 --> 01:59:03.870
NO WHERE IT STARTS NO WHEN IT

01:59:03.936 --> 01:59:05.304
GOES TO THE HOSPITAL KNOW WHEN

01:59:05.371 --> 01:59:06.539
IT'S USED AT THE HOSPITAL KNOW

01:59:06.606 --> 01:59:08.074
WHEN IT'S PICKED UP FROM THE

01:59:08.140 --> 01:59:10.109
HOSPITAL.

01:59:10.176 --> 01:59:10.710
AND THE NO ONE IS LOGGED INTO

01:59:10.776 --> 01:59:11.310
EVIDENCE.

01:59:11.377 --> 01:59:12.512
AT LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THEN ALSO

01:59:12.578 --> 01:59:14.046
AT THE LAB AND WHAT HAPPENS

01:59:14.113 --> 01:59:16.215
THROUGH THE LAB PROCESS.

01:59:16.282 --> 01:59:17.483
THAT IS A WAY TO INCREASE

01:59:17.550 --> 01:59:18.918
ACCOUNTABILITY TRANSPARENCY

01:59:18.985 --> 01:59:20.553
ABOUT THREE CAN HANDLING SYSTEM.

01:59:20.620 --> 01:59:21.854
AND BUILD IN A WAY FOR SURVIVORS

01:59:21.921 --> 01:59:23.422
TO BE ABLE TO LOG INTO THAT

01:59:23.489 --> 01:59:24.557
SYSTEM TO CHECK WHERE THE RAPE

01:59:24.624 --> 01:59:25.858
KIT IS AT ALL TIMES BECAUSE MANY

01:59:25.925 --> 01:59:27.059
OF THEM LEAVE THE HOSPITAL THEY

01:59:27.126 --> 01:59:28.461
NEVER EVER HEAR AGAIN.

01:59:28.528 --> 01:59:30.696
WHERE THEIR KID IS?

01:59:30.763 --> 01:59:33.332
A VICTIMS RIGHTS TO KNOW THE

01:59:33.399 --> 01:59:34.834
STATUS OF THEIR CATS -- SING

01:59:34.901 --> 01:59:35.768
LEGISLATION ACROSS THE COUNTRY

01:59:35.835 --> 01:59:37.403
THAT GRANTS VICTIMS THE RIGHT TO

01:59:37.470 --> 01:59:39.305
KNOW WHERE THEIR KID AS IN MOST

01:59:39.372 --> 01:59:40.439
STATES THEY DO NOT ACTUALLY HAVE

01:59:40.506 --> 01:59:42.041
THAT RIGHT NOW AND MANY OF THEM

01:59:42.108 --> 01:59:42.808
AGAIN.

01:59:42.875 --> 01:59:43.743
NEVER FIND OUT WHERE THEIR KID

01:59:43.809 --> 01:59:45.478
IS AND THEN OF COURSE FUNDING

01:59:45.545 --> 01:59:47.079
FOR ALL OF THESE REFORMS -- IT

01:59:47.146 --> 01:59:47.980
DOES COST MONEY TO TEST RATE

01:59:48.047 --> 01:59:50.616
CUTS AND SO IT'S IMPORTANT FOR

01:59:50.683 --> 01:59:53.252
THE STATE. TO STEP UP AND MAKE

01:59:53.319 --> 01:59:55.354
SURE THAT THEY'RE SUPPORTING

01:59:55.421 --> 01:59:56.656
THESE EFFORTS ARE APPROPRIATIONS.

01:59:56.722 --> 01:59:58.558
SO TODAY TWENTY THREE STATES

01:59:58.624 --> 02:00:00.059
HAVE MANDATED THE COLLECTION OR

02:00:00.126 --> 02:00:01.627
THE TESTING OF NEWLY COLLECTED

02:00:01.694 --> 02:00:03.462
RATE CUTS. TEN STATES REQUIRE

02:00:03.529 --> 02:00:05.231
THE TESTING OF BOTH BACKLOG AND

02:00:05.298 --> 02:00:07.433
NEWLY COLLECTED KIDS THE STATE'S

02:00:07.500 --> 02:00:09.569
OUR COLORADO GEORGIA HAWAII

02:00:09.635 --> 02:00:12.038
ILLINOIS KENTUCKY MASSACHUSETTS

02:00:12.104 --> 02:00:14.507
NEW YORK OHIO PENNSYLVANIA AND

02:00:14.574 --> 02:00:15.808
TEXAS.

02:00:15.875 --> 02:00:17.777
HOW YA KENTUCKY MASSACHUSETTS

02:00:17.843 --> 02:00:20.012
NEW YORK AND TAXES ALL HAVE

02:00:20.079 --> 02:00:22.415
ENACTED FULL REFORM?

02:00:22.481 --> 02:00:24.383
AND MASSACHUSETTS IN KENTUCKY

02:00:24.450 --> 02:00:28.888
JUST IN THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS.

02:00:28.955 --> 02:00:30.489
MICHIGAN OF SORRY COLORADO

02:00:30.556 --> 02:00:32.491
ILLINOIS MICHIGAN NEVADA OHIO

02:00:32.558 --> 02:00:34.694
UTAH AND WASHINGTON STATE ARE

02:00:34.760 --> 02:00:36.596
ALSO CLOSE TO FULL REFORM.

02:00:36.662 --> 02:00:38.197
THE CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO JOIN

02:00:38.264 --> 02:00:39.732
THIS GROWING LIST OF STATES THAT

02:00:39.799 --> 02:00:41.267
ARE REFORMING THE WAY THAT

02:00:41.334 --> 02:00:42.702
THEY'RE HANDLING RIGHT KIDS.

02:00:42.768 --> 02:00:44.170
HERE'S A SNAPSHOT OF WHERE

02:00:44.236 --> 02:00:45.972
CALIFORNIA STANDS ON REFORM AND

02:00:46.038 --> 02:00:46.839
WE'VE BEEN HERE A LONG TIME SO I

02:00:46.906 --> 02:00:47.440
HAVE.

02:00:47.506 --> 02:00:49.208
A LOT IN MY WRITTEN TESTIMONY

02:00:49.275 --> 02:00:50.676
THAT YOU CAN LOOK AT I JUST

02:00:50.743 --> 02:00:51.844
WANNA LET YOU KNOW THAT SO FAR

IN CALIFORNIA AND AS YOU HEARD

02:01:56.909 --> 02:01:58.077
THE GOVERNOR VETOED THAT BILL.

02:01:58.144 --> 02:01:59.545
I'M MORE WORKING ON THAT NOW

02:01:59.612 --> 02:02:01.814
WOULD LIKE TO PUT CALIFORNIA ON

02:02:01.881 --> 02:02:03.482
OUR MAP.

02:02:03.549 --> 02:02:04.383
A FULL REFORM ME LIKE THEM LIKE

02:02:04.450 --> 02:02:05.084
TO JOIN.

02:02:05.151 --> 02:02:07.319
THE STATE'S LIKE AWAY KENTUCKY

02:02:07.386 --> 02:02:09.989
AND TEXAS -- AND BE IN THE FIRST

02:02:10.056 --> 02:02:10.923
TEN STATES TO DO SO I THINK IT'S

02:02:10.990 --> 02:02:12.725
A IS -- SOMETHING THAT

02:02:12.792 --> 02:02:16.095
CALIFORNIA CAN DO AND CALIFORNIA

02:02:16.162 --> 02:02:16.996
SHOULD BE A LEADER IN THIS AREA.

02:02:17.063 --> 02:02:18.364
OUR RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CHANGE

02:02:18.431 --> 02:02:20.066
IN CALIFORNIA ARE TOO FIRST AND

02:02:20.132 --> 02:02:22.702
FOREMOST PASSED SENATE BILL --

02:02:22.768 --> 02:02:23.436
TWENTY TWO THIS SESSION A

02:02:23.502 --> 02:02:26.105
MANDATE THAT TESTING OF ALL CATS --

02:02:26.172 --> 02:02:27.540
I DO WANT TO MENTION I I DO

02:02:27.606 --> 02:02:28.741
THINK -- AND I DON'T KNOW

02:02:28.808 --> 02:02:29.975
EXACTLY WHERE THIS FITS BUT

02:02:30.042 --> 02:02:31.777
THERE ARE COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE

02:02:31.844 --> 02:02:33.312
COUNTRY WHO ARE SENDING.

02:02:33.379 --> 02:02:35.114
KIDS DIRECTLY FROM THE

02:02:35.181 --> 02:02:36.849
COLLECTION POINT TO THE LAB AND

02:02:36.916 --> 02:02:37.950
SKIPPING LAW ENFORCEMENT

02:02:38.017 --> 02:02:40.286
ALTOGETHER I THINK THAT THAT IS

02:02:40.352 --> 02:02:43.355
A FABULOUS IDEA -- WE ALSO WOULD

02:02:43.422 --> 02:02:46.258
LIKE TO MANDATE -- PARTICIPATION

02:02:46.325 --> 02:02:49.595
IN TO THE CODIS -- HEAD OUT COME

02:02:49.662 --> 02:02:49.895
[inaudible]

02:02:49.962 --> 02:02:52.798
PROJECT PLATFORM -- I THINK THAT

02:02:52.865 --> 02:02:54.467
THAT WOULD MEAN A FOLLOWING

02:02:54.533 --> 02:02:55.534
WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THESE KIDS

02:02:55.601 --> 02:02:56.702
ON THIS TESTING SOUP IS REALLY

02:02:56.769 --> 02:02:59.038
IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTANDING WHAT

02:02:59.105 --> 02:02:59.605
WE'RE DOING WITH OUR KIDS IN

02:02:59.672 --> 02:03:01.574
CALIFORNIA.

02:03:01.640 --> 02:03:03.943
SO IN -- TWENTY SEVENTEEN JOYFUL

02:03:04.009 --> 02:03:05.611
HEARTS A PROJECT CALLED THE

02:03:05.678 --> 02:03:07.446
ACCOUNTABILITY PROJECT ISSUED

02:03:07.513 --> 02:03:09.215
FREEDOM OF INFORMATION REQUESTS

02:03:09.281 --> 02:03:11.283
ARE OPEN RECORDS REQUEST. TO

02:03:11.350 --> 02:03:12.051
EIGHT JURISDICTIONS IN

02:03:12.118 --> 02:03:13.786
CALIFORNIA AND FOUND THAT SIX

02:03:13.853 --> 02:03:15.955
OUT OF EIGHT OR 75%.

02:03:16.021 --> 02:03:17.323
ARE EITHER NOT FOLLOWING THE

02:03:17.389 --> 02:03:18.824
ENCOURAGEMENT OF THE LAW AS IT

02:03:18.891 --> 02:03:20.392
STANDS NOW WHICH BASICALLY

02:03:20.459 --> 02:03:22.128
SUGGESTS SENDING RIGHT KITS FOR

02:03:22.194 --> 02:03:24.497
TESTING -- OR THEY HAVE NO WAY

02:03:24.563 --> 02:03:26.065
OF KNOWING HOW MANY RAPISTS ARE

02:03:26.132 --> 02:03:27.399
RECEIVING AND WHERE THEY ARE AND

02:03:27.466 --> 02:03:28.567
WHETHER THEY'VE BEEN SENT TO A

02:03:28.634 --> 02:03:29.435
LAB FOR TESTING.

02:03:29.502 --> 02:03:31.036
SO RIGHT NOW IN CALIFORNIA

02:03:31.103 --> 02:03:32.271
DESPITE ALL THE PROOF THAT

02:03:32.338 --> 02:03:33.472
TESTING RIGHT KIDS.

02:03:33.539 --> 02:03:35.674
IS THE BEST PRACTICE WHETHER OR

02:03:35.741 --> 02:03:37.810
NOT EVERY KID GETS TESTED A PINT

02:03:37.877 --> 02:03:40.579
DEPENDS ON THE SURVIVORS OF CODE.

02:03:40.646 --> 02:03:42.214
AND THAT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE.

02:03:42.281 --> 02:03:42.748
SO AS SOON AS A STATEWIDE

02:03:42.815 --> 02:03:44.350
INVENTORY IS DONE THEN THE STATE

02:03:44.416 --> 02:03:45.851

REPORTED CRIME.

02:03:52.191 --> 02:03:53.592
AND THEN IN ADDITION TO OUR

02:03:53.659 --> 02:03:54.927
STATE APPROPRIATIONS FOR TESTING

COMPREHENSIVE GRANT PROGRAM -- I

THE ANNUAL INVENTORY -- THAT

02:04:16.549 --> 02:04:18.450

THE WRITTEN INVENTORY THAT'S

02:04:25.391 --> 02:04:27.159
REQUIRED UNDER AB FORTY ONE

ALSO -- THE RATE TO SAFETY

02:04:52.751 --> 02:04:54.787

02:05:22.615 --> 02:05:23.282
SO WE RECOMMEND THAT THIS

02:05:23.349 --> 02:05:24.016

02:07:15.694 --> 02:07:16.962
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO SAY IT

02:07:17.029 --> 02:07:18.397
NOT ONLY CHANGE MY LIFE BUT THE

02:07:18.464 --> 02:07:21.233
LIFE OF PEOPLE IN MY FAMILY MY

02:07:21.300 --> 02:07:22.601
MOTHER IN PARTICULAR.

02:07:22.668 --> 02:07:24.403
MY FRIENDS I MEAN THIS WAS A

02:07:24.470 --> 02:07:26.505
CRIME THAT WAS COMMITTED ON ME

02:07:26.572 --> 02:07:29.675
BUT JUST AFFECTED SO MANY -- OF

02:07:29.742 --> 02:07:33.812
COURSE AFTER I WAS ASSAULTED --

02:07:33.879 --> 02:07:35.614
MY FIRST INSTINCT OF COURSE WAS

02:07:35.681 --> 02:07:37.349
TO TAKE A SHOWER BECAUSE YOU YOU

02:07:37.416 --> 02:07:39.618
JUST YOU KNOW WANT TO FORGET

02:07:39.685 --> 02:07:41.320
EVERYTHING YOU WANT TO JUST

02:07:41.387 --> 02:07:42.187
ERASE.

02:07:42.254 --> 02:07:44.189
EVERY HORRIBLE THING THAT'S JUST

02:07:44.256 --> 02:07:46.158
HAPPEN TO YOU -- BUT THEN YOU

02:07:46.225 --> 02:07:48.327
HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT YOUR BODY

02:07:48.394 --> 02:07:50.996
HAS BECOME A CRIME SCENE -- AND

02:07:51.063 --> 02:07:54.199
SO I I DID DO A RAPE KIT TESTS

02:07:54.266 --> 02:07:54.733
IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE

02:07:54.800 --> 02:07:55.701
ASSAULT.

02:07:55.768 --> 02:07:57.469
THE LAST THING I WANTED TO DO

02:07:57.536 --> 02:07:59.972
CERTAINLY HAPPY SOMETHING I DID

02:08:00.039 --> 02:08:03.509
NOW -- YOU KNOW AFTER AN ASSAULT

02:08:03.575 --> 02:08:05.544
TO GO THROUGH THAT PROCESS OF

02:08:05.611 --> 02:08:08.347
HAVING A RAPE KITS ON YOU ARE

02:08:08.414 --> 02:08:11.984
POKED AND PRODDED.

02:08:12.051 --> 02:08:13.385
AT A MOMENT IN YOUR LIFE.

02:08:13.452 --> 02:08:16.088
WHERE YOU JUST DON'T WANT

02:08:16.155 --> 02:08:17.890
ANYTHING MORE TO DO WITH WHAT

02:08:17.956 --> 02:08:19.158
JUST HAPPENED HE WON A MAYBE YOU

02:08:19.224 --> 02:08:20.859
KNOW IN MY IN MY CASE I WANTED

02:08:20.926 --> 02:08:22.761
TO JUST CRAWL INTO A BALL AND

02:08:22.828 --> 02:08:24.296
FORGET ANYTHING IT JUST HAPPENED?

02:08:24.363 --> 02:08:27.099
SO ONCE AGAIN YEARS SPLAYED OUT

02:08:27.166 --> 02:08:28.967
YOUR ASK QUESTIONS YOU'RE ASKED

02:08:29.034 --> 02:08:30.803
TO RECALL THINGS YOU YOU DON'T

02:08:30.869 --> 02:08:33.172
WANT TO TALK ABOUT -- BUT I

02:08:33.238 --> 02:08:35.407
RECOGNIZE IN THAT MOMENT THAT A

02:08:35.474 --> 02:08:36.909
RAPE KIT WAS SO NECESSARY

02:08:36.975 --> 02:08:38.277
BECAUSE IS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR

02:08:38.343 --> 02:08:39.645
ME TO FIND.

02:08:39.711 --> 02:08:41.847
THIS PERSON THAT HAD DONE THAT

02:08:41.914 --> 02:08:45.350
AWFUL THING TO ME AND THAT AWFUL

02:08:45.417 --> 02:08:46.885
THING TO MY BODY.

02:08:46.952 --> 02:08:49.788
I HAD NO IDEA AT THE TIME THAT

02:08:49.855 --> 02:08:52.791
MY RAPE KIT WOULD SIT ON A SHELF

02:08:52.858 --> 02:08:54.126
FOR NINE AND A HALF YEARS

02:08:54.193 --> 02:08:55.227
COLLECTING DUST.

02:08:55.294 --> 02:08:58.464
NO IDEA -- IN MY CASE I HAD NO

02:08:58.530 --> 02:09:00.732
IDEA MY RAPE KIT HAD NOT BEEN

02:09:00.799 --> 02:09:02.634
TESTED I WOULDN'T IT WOULDN'T

02:09:02.701 --> 02:09:04.903
EVEN DAWN ON ME THAT IT WASN'T.

02:09:04.970 --> 02:09:06.371
BECAUSE I COULD IMAGINE HAVING

02:09:06.438 --> 02:09:08.340
BEEN PUT THROUGH THAT PROCESS

02:09:08.407 --> 02:09:12.311
FOR NOTHING -- SO THOSE YEARS OF

02:09:12.377 --> 02:09:13.745
THOSE NINE AND A HALF YEARS

02:09:13.812 --> 02:09:15.447
WHERE'D HEARD NOTHING.

02:09:15.514 --> 02:09:19.151
I BEGAN BLAMING MYSELF FOR NOT

02:09:19.218 --> 02:09:20.819
HAVING PUT THAT PERPETRATED

02:09:20.886 --> 02:09:22.287
BEHIND BARS.

02:09:22.354 --> 02:09:24.857
THERE WAS NO DOUBT IN MY MIND HE

02:09:24.923 --> 02:09:26.792
HEARD OTHERS I DON'T THINK IT

02:09:26.859 --> 02:09:29.461
TAKES -- A PSYCHOLOGIST TO SAY

02:09:29.528 --> 02:09:31.930
OKAY SOMEONE WHO PUTS A GUN TO

02:09:31.997 --> 02:09:33.532
SOMEONE'S HEAD.

02:09:33.599 --> 02:09:37.369
AND RAPES THEM IS GOING SUDDENLY

02:09:37.436 --> 02:09:40.172
BECOME A PILLAR OF STAFF SOCIETY

02:09:40.239 --> 02:09:41.240
HAD IF THEY'RE NOT KIND OF

02:09:41.306 --> 02:09:43.242
CAUGHT IN AND SO ON SO I KNEW HE

02:09:43.308 --> 02:09:44.943
WAS OUT THERE HARMING OTHERS.

02:09:45.010 --> 02:09:46.211
AND THE ENTIRE TIME I REALLY

02:09:46.278 --> 02:09:47.779
TOOK THE ONUS OF THE

02:09:47.846 --> 02:09:51.350
RESPONSIBILITY OF HAVING SUCH A

02:09:51.416 --> 02:09:52.684
DANGEROUS PERSON.

02:09:52.751 --> 02:09:54.753
ON MYSELF I BLAME MYSELF PERHAPS

02:09:54.820 --> 02:09:55.621
THEY DIDN'T.

02:09:55.687 --> 02:09:57.289
ARTICULATE LAW ENFORCEMENT

02:09:57.356 --> 02:09:59.591
APPROPRIATELY AND SO I CAN I

02:09:59.658 --> 02:10:01.093
CARRY THAT FOR A LOT OF YEARS

02:10:01.160 --> 02:10:04.263
AND TELL MY MY CAT WAS TESTED --

02:10:04.329 --> 02:10:05.731
FINALLY.

02:10:05.797 --> 02:10:09.301
AND ALTHOUGH IT TOOK MANY YEARS

02:10:09.368 --> 02:10:11.069
FOR ONCE THE KIT WAS TESTED

02:10:11.136 --> 02:10:13.639
THERE WAS INITIALLY NO MATCHING

02:10:13.705 --> 02:10:15.240
PROFILING COATIS.

02:10:15.307 --> 02:10:19.611
SO IT WASN'T UNTIL -- IS SEVEN

02:10:19.678 --> 02:10:21.246
YEARS LATER THAT I MATCH WAS

02:10:21.313 --> 02:10:24.049
MADE IN CODE S. AND THE MAN THAT

02:10:24.116 --> 02:10:26.285
RATE ME WAS APPREHENDED -- BUT

02:10:26.351 --> 02:10:27.786
NOT AFTER HE MADE A COMMITTED

02:10:27.853 --> 02:10:29.955
CRIMES IN EIGHT DIFFERENT STATES

02:10:30.022 --> 02:10:31.390
ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

02:10:31.456 --> 02:10:34.159
AND THE MAN THAT RATE ME WASN'T

02:10:34.226 --> 02:10:36.195
A SPECIALIST HE DIDN'T STICK TO

02:10:36.261 --> 02:10:38.664
SEXUAL ASSAULTS I'M HE COMMITTED

02:10:38.730 --> 02:10:39.965
A VARIETY OF CRIMES HE WAS A

02:10:40.032 --> 02:10:41.800
BURDEN ON TAXPAYERS HE WAS A

02:10:41.867 --> 02:10:43.602
BURDEN ON LAW ENFORCEMENT HE WAS

02:10:43.669 --> 02:10:46.371
A VERY DANGEROUS INDIVIDUAL.

02:10:46.438 --> 02:10:50.008
THAT WAS OUT ON THE STREET --

02:10:50.075 --> 02:10:51.210
THANKFULLY.

02:10:51.276 --> 02:10:52.778
AND THIS IS A RARITY.

02:10:52.844 --> 02:10:54.580
I I WAS ABLE TO SEE MY DAY IN

02:10:54.646 --> 02:10:56.982
COURT AND I DID I WAS ABLE TO

02:10:57.049 --> 02:10:58.217
TESTIFY.

02:10:58.283 --> 02:11:00.452
I WAS ABLE TO FACE THE MAN THAT

02:11:00.519 --> 02:11:03.188
ASSAULTED ME IN A COURT ROOM.

02:11:03.255 --> 02:11:04.990
AND I KNOW THAT I'M AND I'M ONLY

02:11:05.057 --> 02:11:08.827
AND I RECOGNIZE HOW.

02:11:08.894 --> 02:11:10.963
HOW IMPORTANT IS TO REALLY SPEAK

02:11:11.029 --> 02:11:12.497
OUT AND SAY THAT THIS IS NOT

02:11:12.564 --> 02:11:14.466
LIKE PAR FOR THE COURSE MY CASE

02:11:14.533 --> 02:11:15.133
ISN'T?

02:11:15.200 --> 02:11:16.702
HOW IT WORKS IT'S JUST AN

02:11:16.768 --> 02:11:17.836
EXAMPLE OF?

02:11:17.903 --> 02:11:21.273
IT WORKING WHILE -- SO AFTER I

02:11:21.340 --> 02:11:22.841
TESTIFIED.

02:11:22.908 --> 02:11:25.010
ON THE TORONTO SUN MAN THAT RATE

02:11:25.077 --> 02:11:28.180
MEAN WAS PUT BEHIND BARS TO

02:11:28.247 --> 02:11:28.780
TWENTY FIFTY SEVEN WHICH IS A

02:11:28.847 --> 02:11:31.116
GREAT TRIUMPH AND CERTAINLY A

02:11:31.183 --> 02:11:31.850
TRIUMPH.

02:11:31.917 --> 02:11:33.752
THAT IT DIDN'T COME BECAUSE OF

02:11:33.819 --> 02:11:35.254
ME BECAME BECAUSE THE

02:11:35.320 --> 02:11:36.688
PROSECUTORS.

02:11:36.755 --> 02:11:38.490
STRUCK WITH EVERYTHING LAW

02:11:38.557 --> 02:11:39.958
ENFORCEMENT IN MY CASE STUCK

02:11:40.025 --> 02:11:41.493
WITH EVERYTHING.

02:11:41.560 --> 02:11:43.028
AND IT WAS JUST THIS AMAZING

02:11:43.095 --> 02:11:45.631
TEAM THAT WORK TOGETHER FOR THE

02:11:45.697 --> 02:11:47.399
BEST INTERESTS OF NOT ONLY ME IN

02:11:47.466 --> 02:11:49.768
FINDING JUSTICE BUT FOR THE BEST

02:11:49.835 --> 02:11:51.570
INTERESTS OF SURVIVORS MOVING

02:11:51.637 --> 02:11:54.439
FORWARD AND AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE

02:11:54.506 --> 02:11:57.909
AND AND FOR ALSO PUBLIC SAFETY.

02:11:57.976 --> 02:11:59.378
SO.

02:11:59.444 --> 02:12:00.746
YOU KNOW MY STORY HAD IT HAD AN

02:12:00.812 --> 02:12:04.049
ENDING AND I HAVE -- I HAVE THE

02:12:04.116 --> 02:12:05.484
ABILITY TO HAVE CLOSURE ON MY

02:12:05.550 --> 02:12:06.985
CASE AND I KNOW THAT'S NOT THE

02:12:07.052 --> 02:12:08.787
CASE AND I THINK WHAT ONE OF THE

02:12:08.854 --> 02:12:10.522
REASONS I I TALK ABOUT SOMETHING

02:12:10.589 --> 02:12:12.591
IT'S SO DIFFICULT TO TALK ABOUT.

02:12:12.658 --> 02:12:14.626
IS I I WANT TO ENSURE THAT I'M

02:12:14.693 --> 02:12:16.528
NOT AN ANOMALY AND THAT OTHER

02:12:16.595 --> 02:12:18.897
INDIVIDUALS RECEIVE THE JUSTICE.

02:12:18.964 --> 02:12:20.565
THAT I WAS REALLY FORTUNATE TO

02:12:20.632 --> 02:12:23.435
HAVE AND ALSO WE USE MY CASES AN

02:12:23.502 --> 02:12:25.137
EXPERIENCE FOR LEARNING AND A

02:12:25.203 --> 02:12:28.006
WAY TO KIND OF ENSURE THAT WE

02:12:28.073 --> 02:12:29.541
ARE USING BEST PRACTICES WE'RE

02:12:29.608 --> 02:12:31.843
MAKING SURE KIDS ARE TESTED.

02:12:31.910 --> 02:12:33.478
HIS IT'S IT'S GREAT THAT YOU CAN

02:12:33.545 --> 02:12:35.147
GATHER DATA AND WE SEE THE DATE

02:12:35.213 --> 02:12:37.616
AND IT'S REALLY OBVIOUS THAT WE

02:12:37.683 --> 02:12:39.051
SHOULD BE TESTING RAPE KITS BUT

02:12:39.117 --> 02:12:40.519
YOU'RE PUTTING SURVIVORS.

02:12:40.585 --> 02:12:42.354
IN PART OF THIS PROCESS I THINK

02:12:42.421 --> 02:12:45.090
IT'S JUST SO NECESSARY BECAUSE I

02:12:45.157 --> 02:12:46.224
THINK SOMETIMES WE HAVE A

02:12:46.291 --> 02:12:48.694
TENDENCY TO GET LOST IN THE DATA.

02:12:48.760 --> 02:12:50.362
AND FORGET THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE

02:12:50.429 --> 02:12:53.865
ATTACHED TO THESE RAPE KITS THAT.

02:12:53.932 --> 02:12:54.833
WHOSE LIVES OF HAVE CHANGED

02:12:54.900 --> 02:12:58.236
FOREVER -- AND IT'S ALSO REALLY

02:12:58.303 --> 02:13:00.572
IMPORTANT BIG I THINK IN MY CASE

02:13:00.639 --> 02:13:01.840
BECAUSE I WAS ABLE TO RECEIVE

02:13:01.907 --> 02:13:03.342
CLOSURE AND I WAS TREATED WITH

02:13:03.408 --> 02:13:06.111
SUCH DIGNITY AND RESPECT -- I

02:13:06.178 --> 02:13:08.246
WAS KIND OF IN POWER TO BE ABLE

02:13:08.313 --> 02:13:09.948
TO COME OUT AN ADVOCATE AND

02:13:10.015 --> 02:13:11.483
BECOME AN ADVOCATE AND TALK

02:13:11.550 --> 02:13:15.253
ABOUT -- RAPE KIT REFORM AND AN

02:13:15.320 --> 02:13:17.689
AND I'M JUST SO INCREDIBLY

02:13:17.756 --> 02:13:21.593
GRATEFUL FOR THAT -- I YOU KNOW

02:13:21.660 --> 02:13:23.729
THIS IS IT'S INTERESTING THIS IS

02:13:23.795 --> 02:13:25.630
THE EIGHTH TIME I'VE COME TO

02:13:25.697 --> 02:13:27.866
THIS AMAZING STATE HOUSE WHICH I

02:13:27.933 --> 02:13:29.101
THINK IS JUST ABSOLUTELY.

02:13:29.167 --> 02:13:30.369
BREATHTAKING AND IT'S ALWAYS

02:13:30.435 --> 02:13:32.404
JUST.

02:13:32.471 --> 02:13:35.707
SUCH ON IT I'M JUST ALWAYS I AM

02:13:35.774 --> 02:13:37.809
IN AWE OF THIS BUILDING AND ALSO

02:13:37.876 --> 02:13:39.077
THE PEOPLE THAT.

02:13:39.144 --> 02:13:41.146
ARE IN IT -- SENATOR LEYVA

02:13:41.213 --> 02:13:43.615
WORKING EXTREMELY HARD ON THIS

02:13:43.682 --> 02:13:45.217
LEGISLATION.

02:13:45.283 --> 02:13:46.718
THAT I THINK IS SO IMPORTANT.

02:13:46.785 --> 02:13:48.353
AND AND I THINK.

02:13:48.420 --> 02:13:50.255
CALIFORNIA AS A WHOLE HAS ALL

02:13:50.322 --> 02:13:51.923
THESE SUPER HEROES AND I THINK

02:13:51.990 --> 02:13:54.059
IT'S IMPORTANT AND NECESSARY TO

02:13:54.126 --> 02:13:55.360
LISTEN.

02:13:55.427 --> 02:13:56.962
TO THEIR EXAMPLES DA O'MALLEY

02:13:57.028 --> 02:13:58.797
AND WHAT SHE DONE AND ALAMEDA

02:13:58.864 --> 02:14:02.067
COUNTY IS AMAZING NOT NOT JUST

02:14:02.134 --> 02:14:03.902
FOR CALIFORNIA BUT THE ENTIRE

02:14:03.969 --> 02:14:06.104
NATION -- AND I THINK THAT

02:14:06.171 --> 02:14:07.539
THERE'S JUST THESE AMAZING

02:14:07.606 --> 02:14:08.740
PEOPLE WHO ARE DOING GREAT

02:14:08.807 --> 02:14:10.108
THINGS IN CALIFORNIA AND IT'S

02:14:10.175 --> 02:14:11.343
IMPORTANT TO OF BILL DISLIKE

02:14:11.410 --> 02:14:13.278
COHESIVE UNIT AND CREATE

02:14:13.345 --> 02:14:14.446
LEGISLATION.

02:14:14.513 --> 02:14:17.682
SO THAT EVERYTHING IS CONSISTENT

02:14:17.749 --> 02:14:19.351
AND THAT SURVIVORS AND IN THE

02:14:19.418 --> 02:14:23.855
STATE RECEIVE JUSTICE -- AND

02:14:23.922 --> 02:14:24.623
THAT EVERYBODY KIND OF

02:14:24.689 --> 02:14:26.258
RECOGNIZES THAT IT'S OKAY TO

02:14:26.324 --> 02:14:29.661
COME FORWARD AND SAVE BEEN

02:14:36.435 --> 02:14:39.171
RAPE BEING SO UNDERREPORTED IN

02:14:39.237 --> 02:14:41.139
ONE OF THE REASONS WHY AS OTHER

02:14:41.206 --> 02:14:42.874
SURVIVORS OF TOLD ME AS THAT

02:14:42.941 --> 02:14:44.342
THEY JUST DON'T TRUST THAT

02:14:44.409 --> 02:14:46.077
ANYTHING MORE IS GOING TO HAPPEN

02:14:46.144 --> 02:14:47.245
IN THAT CASE.

02:14:47.312 --> 02:14:48.580
I MEAN CERTAINLY A LOT OF IT

02:14:48.647 --> 02:14:50.115
COMES FROM THE SHAME AND THE ME

02:14:50.182 --> 02:14:52.284
TOO MOVEMENT HAS CERTAINLY WORK

02:14:52.350 --> 02:14:53.952
TO EMPOWER SURVIVORS SO THEY CAN.

02:14:54.019 --> 02:14:55.954
SHARE THEIR STORIES MORE BUT A

02:14:56.021 --> 02:14:57.522
LOT OF TIME SURVIVORS JUST DON'T

02:14:57.589 --> 02:14:59.691
FEEL LIKE ANYTHING'S GOING TO BE

02:14:59.758 --> 02:14:59.891
DONE.

02:14:59.958 --> 02:15:02.727
AND THAT'S REALLY HEARTBREAKING

02:15:02.794 --> 02:15:04.830
IT'S IT AND IT'S REALLY.

02:15:04.896 --> 02:15:06.998
I THINK CITIZENS SHOULD ALSO BE

02:15:07.065 --> 02:15:08.366
OUTRAGE THAT THAT'S THE CASE

02:15:08.433 --> 02:15:10.469
BECAUSE AGAIN WHEN WE LOOK AT

02:15:10.535 --> 02:15:11.903
INDIVIDUALS WHO.

02:15:11.970 --> 02:15:13.238
COMMIT THESE KIND OF CRIMES THEY

02:15:13.305 --> 02:15:14.639

TESTIMONIES TOUCHED UPON IT --

02:16:52.504 --> 02:16:54.205
BUT ADDITIONALLY YOU FIRST BEGIN

02:16:54.272 --> 02:16:55.640
BY SAYING YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA'S

02:16:55.707 --> 02:16:57.409
BUT FOUR OF THE SIX PILLARS OF

02:16:57.475 --> 02:16:59.077
WERE MISSING THE OTHER.

02:16:59.144 --> 02:16:59.711
TWO AND I WAS TRYING TO FIGURE

02:16:59.778 --> 02:17:01.346
OUT WHAT THOSE TWO WERE BECAUSE

02:17:01.413 --> 02:17:02.948
ONE SOUNDED LIKE TRACKING AND

02:17:03.014 --> 02:17:04.549
THEN THE OTHER ONE WAS AND GETS

02:17:04.616 --> 02:17:07.218
TO AND PUT INTO THE THE LONG FOR

02:17:07.285 --> 02:17:08.853

SORE THAT WATER THE TWO PILLARS

02:17:14.459 --> 02:17:15.660
WERE STILL MISSING IN CALIFORNIA

02:17:15.727 --> 02:17:16.628
SO WE COULD.

02:17:16.695 --> 02:17:18.263
HAVE THIS FULL REFORM LIKE THE

02:17:18.330 --> 02:17:20.398
OTHER STATES DO RIGHT -- SO IT'S

02:17:20.465 --> 02:17:22.000
MANDATE IN THE TESTING OF NEWLY

02:17:22.067 --> 02:17:23.969
COLLECTED KITS WHICH SB TWENTY

02:17:24.035 --> 02:17:24.936
TWO WILL DO.

02:17:25.003 --> 02:17:26.705
MANDATING THAT TESTING OF ALL

02:17:26.771 --> 02:17:28.573
THE PREVIOUSLY UNTESTED AN

02:17:28.640 --> 02:17:30.275
UNSYMPATHETIC KIDS THAT WILL BE

02:17:30.342 --> 02:17:33.979
IDENTIFIED -- THROUGH THE STATE

02:17:34.045 --> 02:17:35.780
WIDE AUDIT -- AND THEN THERE ARE

02:17:35.847 --> 02:17:37.716
YOU KNOW OTHER LITTLE. TWO WEEKS --

02:17:37.782 --> 02:17:39.117
TO THE TRACKING SYSTEM I THINK

02:17:39.184 --> 02:17:42.554
THAT -- ARE IMPORTANT

02:17:42.621 --> 02:17:42.854
[inaudible]

02:17:42.921 --> 02:17:45.490
GOT IT.

02:17:45.557 --> 02:17:47.392
OKAY I THINK WE JUST TRY TO FIND

02:17:47.459 --> 02:17:48.760
WAYS TO BE HELPFUL.

02:17:48.827 --> 02:17:50.195
AND SO IT SEEMS LIKE WE'VE BEEN

02:17:50.261 --> 02:17:51.529
WE'VE HAD LEGISLATION THAT WE'VE

02:17:51.596 --> 02:17:54.399
DONE IN THE PAST WE'VE HAD --

02:17:54.466 --> 02:17:55.834
WE'VE UP PUTS MONEY IN LAST

02:17:55.900 --> 02:17:57.602
YEAR'S BUDGET WERE LOOKING TO

02:17:57.669 --> 02:17:59.104
PUT MONEY IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET

02:17:59.170 --> 02:18:00.805
AGAIN I THINK CENTER BALLOT

02:18:00.872 --> 02:18:02.941
TALKED ABOUT THAT AND MISS

02:18:03.008 --> 02:18:03.875
WEBBER AS WELL.

02:18:03.942 --> 02:18:05.010
I MEAN IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE WE

02:18:05.076 --> 02:18:07.012
SHOULD BE DOING HIMCALIFORNIA

02:18:07.078 --> 02:18:09.748
ASIDE FROM WHAT WE'RE CURRENTLY

02:18:09.814 --> 02:18:11.416
WORKING ON TOGETHER. TO TO KIND

02:18:11.483 --> 02:18:12.917
OF MOVE THIS ALONG OR ANYTHING

02:18:12.984 --> 02:18:13.885
THAT YOU REALIZE IN THE

02:18:13.952 --> 02:18:14.986
TESTIMONY MAYBE WITH PREVIOUS

02:18:15.053 --> 02:18:16.855
PANEL THAT.

02:18:16.921 --> 02:18:19.824
THAT WE SHOULD FOLLOW UP ON BUT

02:18:19.891 --> 02:18:22.127
I ACT I THINK THAT THE OUTCOME

02:18:22.193 --> 02:18:23.628
INFORMATION IS REALLY IMPORTANT

02:18:23.695 --> 02:18:26.064
AND WE BELIEVE STRONGLY THAT YOU

02:18:26.131 --> 02:18:27.732
HAVE TO MANDATE.

02:18:27.799 --> 02:18:30.001
THESE KINDS OF PARTICIPATION OF

02:18:30.068 --> 02:18:31.169
PARTICIPATION.

02:18:31.236 --> 02:18:32.837

YOU LOOK AT THE THE LAW THAT'S

02:18:38.877 --> 02:18:40.512
ON THE BOOKS NOW THAT SAYS THAT

02:18:40.578 --> 02:18:41.579
ONE PERSON SHOULD SEND.

02:18:41.646 --> 02:18:43.782
KIDS FOR TESTING -- THAT JUST

02:18:43.848 --> 02:18:45.517
HASN'T WORKED -- AS WELL

02:18:45.583 --> 02:18:47.886
INTENTIONED AT THE TIME BUT IT'S

02:18:47.952 --> 02:18:49.187
PRETTY CLEAR WE HAVE TO MANDATE

02:18:49.254 --> 02:18:51.156
THAT I DO THINK -- THAT

02:18:51.222 --> 02:18:54.659
MANDATING PARTICIPATION IN SOME

02:18:54.726 --> 02:18:55.660
KIND OF OUTCOME.

02:18:55.727 --> 02:18:56.594
YOU KNOW PROJECT IN MAKING SURE

02:18:56.661 --> 02:18:57.929
THAT EVERY BIT Là PERSON HAS TO

02:18:57.996 --> 02:18:58.863
ENTER THE INFORMATION AND

02:18:58.930 --> 02:18:59.964
PROSECUTORS HAVE GENTRAN

02:19:00.031 --> 02:19:01.366
INFORMATION TO THAT.

02:19:01.433 --> 02:19:02.200
OTHERWISE YOU'RE JUST GONNA GET

02:19:02.267 --> 02:19:03.802
A PATCHWORK QUILT ACROSS THE

02:19:03.868 --> 02:19:05.236
COUNTRY AND YOU REALLY WON'T GET

02:19:05.303 --> 02:19:07.338
THAT KIND OF SOLID.

02:19:07.405 --> 02:19:08.807
DATA THAT YOU THAT YOU WANT.

02:19:08.873 --> 02:19:09.708
AND I THINK THAT'S OF THOSE

02:19:09.774 --> 02:19:11.209
DEFINITELY IDENTIFIED IN THE

02:19:11.276 --> 02:19:12.811
AUDIT SENDS YOU KNOW AS PLEASED

02:19:12.877 --> 02:19:14.312
TO HEAR PART OF JUST TO SAY THAT

02:19:14.379 --> 02:19:15.413
SOMETHING THAT THEY THINK WE

02:19:15.480 --> 02:19:17.115
SHOULD MOVE TOWARDS AS WELL YEAH

02:19:17.182 --> 02:19:18.917
I MEAN THAT ACTUALLY WOULD BE --

02:19:18.983 --> 02:19:20.919
EVER KIND OF A FIRST OF

02:19:20.985 --> 02:19:22.554
CALIFORNIA DID THAT -- THERE ARE

02:19:22.620 --> 02:19:24.622
OTHER COMMUNITIES THAT ARE DOING

02:19:24.689 --> 02:19:27.258
SIMILAR KIND OF OUTCOME -- HAVE

02:19:27.325 --> 02:19:28.760
SORT OF SIMILAR OUTCOME --

02:19:28.827 --> 02:19:31.262

MANDATING SOMETHING LIKE THAT I

02:19:34.299 --> 02:19:35.734
MEAN THAT WOULD BE PRETTY --

02:19:35.800 --> 02:19:37.736
GROUND BREAKING.

02:19:37.802 --> 02:19:39.304

CONSENSUAL SO THEY DECIDED NOT.

02:19:48.947 --> 02:19:51.583
TO SEND THE RAPE KIT TO THE TO

02:19:51.649 --> 02:19:53.118

02:21:30.782 --> 02:21:32.050
MENTION THAT TO TASHA WAS PART

02:21:32.116 --> 02:21:33.284

02:21:43.728 --> 02:21:44.696
SOMETIMES.

02:21:44.762 --> 02:21:48.132
HOW DO YOU GO TELL SURVIVORS?

02:21:48.199 --> 02:21:48.766
YOU KNOW WE HAVE NO INFORMATION

02:21:48.833 --> 02:21:50.768
IN YOUR CASE AFTER THE SYSTEM

02:21:50.835 --> 02:21:53.805
FAILED THEM SO POORLY -- AND SO

02:21:53.872 --> 02:21:55.073
WE'VE DONE RESEARCH ON THAT AND

02:21:55.139 --> 02:21:56.708
SURVIVORS TOLD US THAT.

02:21:56.774 --> 02:21:58.309
THAT HAVING INFORMATION ABOUT

02:21:58.376 --> 02:22:00.178
THEIR CASE AND THEIR KID IS SO

02:22:00.245 --> 02:22:01.512
IMPORTANT TO THEIR HEALING IS

02:22:01.579 --> 02:22:02.914
VERY CENTRAL TO THEIR HEALING

02:22:02.981 --> 02:22:03.915
THEY REALLY STRONGLY FEEL THAT

02:22:03.982 --> 02:22:05.917
THAT INFORMATION BELONGS TO THEM

02:22:05.984 --> 02:22:06.584
AND THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE ACCESS

02:22:06.651 --> 02:22:07.485
TO IT.

02:22:07.552 --> 02:22:08.987
ABSOLUTELY AND THAT ACTUALLY NOT

02:22:09.053 --> 02:22:11.289
THE NOT HAVING ACCESS TO IT

02:22:11.356 --> 02:22:12.657
ACTUALLY DOES NOT HARM.

02:22:12.724 --> 02:22:13.791
