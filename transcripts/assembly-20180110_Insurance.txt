AB TWO OH SIX WAS POLLED. AND WE'RE ON AB FOR SEVENTY NINE BY MISS GONZALEZ FLETCHER WELCOME. I THINK YOU. I'LL BE BRIEF. S. I HAVE RUN THIS BILL MOST YOU HAVE VOTED FOR IT YOM THREE TIMES NOW. THAT IT'S BEEN VETO THANK YOU IT IS VERY THOUGH I NARROWED ITS ESPECIALLY. FOR THOSE WHO HAVEN'T REALLY SEEN AS MUCH I'VE COMPLETELY NARROWED IT IT IT HAS TO GENDER BIAS IN WORKERS COMPENSATION TO ONLY DEALING WITH THE ISSUE OF HOW. BREAST CANCER IS RATED RIGHT NOW UNFORTUNATELY. DOCTORS TO WIN A A WOMAN THEY'RE USUALLY. FIRE IN FACT ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY FIREFIGHTERS AND AND PEACE OFFICERS HAVE BREAST CANCER THAT'S BECAUSE ON THE JOB. THEY GIVE IT A RATING AYE IF YOU'RE NOT OF CHILD BEARING AGE OF ZERO PERCENT IF YOU'RE OF CHILD BEARING AGE UP TO FIVE PERCENT THAT'S WHEN YOU LOSE A BREAST. AND IN SOME OF THE WAY AT SUCH UNFORTUNATELY. THE DOCTORS HAVE TO LONG RELIED ON IN MAY GUIDE WHICH BASICALLY SAID. DESCRIBES A FUNCTION OF A BREAST IN A WAY THAT LIKE PROBABLY WE WOULD AND I AGREE WITH. IT'S ONLY FUNCTIONALITY BEAN TO BREASTFEED OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE THAT'S A WHOLE FIVE PERCENT SO I HAD THIS THIS PUTS IT IN LINE THIS WILL MAKE DOCTORS LOOK AT MORE HOLISTICALLY PUT IT MORE IN LINE WITH THE WAY WE WRITE. ON THE LAST OF THE PROSTATE LOTS OF. OTHER THINGS THAT HAPPEN. TO MEN WHEN THEY HAVE CANCER AND SO I I I I AM HOPEFUL THAT THIS LIMITED IT TO JUST THIS I'M FROM THINGS THAT THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IS THAT IN PAST WE WERE HOPEFUL CAN ACTUALLY GET SINUS TIME. SO WE HAVE A COUPLE OF. FOLKS WHO WILL SPEAK ON IT. THANK YOU CHAIR AND ASSEMBLY MEMBERS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS YOU TODAY. I'M CRYSTAL SCHOENFELDER IMMEDIATE PAST PRESIDENT OF CALIFORNIA APPLICANTS ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION AS WELL AS A FOUNDER AND CHAIR OF THE ASSOCIATIONS WOMEN'S CAUCUS. ZERO NOTHING AS THE ASSEMBLYMEMBER SAD THAT'S WHAT THE BOOK THE AMA GUIDE SAYS WE GIVE TO OLDER WOMEN WHO BRAVELY SURVIVED A BREAST CANCER INJURY DUE TO THEIR WORK. BUT HAVE TO LIVE WITH THE AFTERMATH OF THAT CONDITION. AND WHAT ABOUT YOUNGER WOMEN THE BOOK SAYS TO GIVE THEM BETWEEN ZERO FIVE PERCENT PER THE DOCTOR'S DISCRETION. WHAT DOES THE BUT GIVE OTHER pFIVE PERCENT EVEN A HUNDRED PERCENT? THE LEGISLATURE HAS THE DUTY AND THE POWER TO REMEDY THIS GENDER INEQUITY. HOW'S THAT AB FOR SEVENTY NINE IS A SIMPLE STRAIGHT FORWARD COST EFFECTIVE SOLUTION. IT MANDATES THAT STATE APPOINTED DOCTORS CONSIDER ALL CONSEQUENCES OF BREAST CANCER INCLUDING THE SURGICAL PROCEDURE LOSS OF FUNCTION OF THE UPPER EXTREMITY YOUR EXTREMITIES SKIN DISFIGUREMENT PAIN AND TREATMENT THE FACTS. AND EIGHTY FOUR SEVENTY NINE GETS RID OF THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN OLDER AND YOUNGER FEMALE BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS. BECAUSE TELLING AN OLDER BREAST CANCER SURVIVOR THAT HER CONDITION IS WORTH NOTHING IS AN ABSOLUTE INSULT ADDED TO THE INJURY. THE BEST WAY TO REMEDY THIS GENDER BIAS IS THE STATE'S WORKERS IN THE STATE'S WORKERS' COMPENSATION SYSTEM IS AB FOR SEVENTY NINE AND WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YEARS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE CHRISTINE BAUM ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS WERE PLEASED TO BE IN VERY STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE.

THE RISK THAT THEY FACE EVERYDAY DO NOT DISCRIMINATE THEIR GENDER AND WE WOULD APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT ON THIS BILL THAT ASSURES THAT THEY ARE DISCRIMINATING AGAINST. WHEN THEY DO SUFFER A JOB CAUSED INJURY. SO WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT. OKAY OKAY. WELCOME KANSEN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISS BOMA. ANY OTHER COMMENTS. COMMENTS. MISS CUT BUREAU HAS A QUESTION.

SHARE MEMBERS JASON SHELTER HERE ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA COALITION ON WORKERS COMPENSATION WANT TO. FIRST ACKNOWLEDGE WHAT THE AUTHOR SAID THAT WHICH IS THAT THIS IS A VERY DIFFERENT BILL AND WE SAW LAST YEAR IN THAT WE OPPOSE LAST YEAR. TO BE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE MOVE AWAY FROM IT A PORTION AND BASS POSTURED OF DIDN'T LOOK AT THE ISSUE. AND WE'RE HAPPY NOT TO HAVE A POSITION TODAY. IT'S THEIR NEW AMENDMENTS WERE LOOKING AT THEM I THINK THE ANALYSIS POINTS OUT SOME REASONABLE I THINGS THAT WE NEED TO DISCUSS SO I THINK OUR APPROACH YEARS GONNA BE SIT DOWN TALK TO THE AUTHOR TALK TO THE SPONSOR. TALK THE ADMINISTRATION AND SEE WHERE WE CAN GET SO WITH THAT THANK YOU WE HAVE NO POSITION DONOR DIVERT EITHER WAY TODAY. OKAY. THANK YOU. STATE PLAYING WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF GREAT POWERS AUTHORITIES WE DEADLINE OUR COMMENTS LIKE THOSE MADE BY CCW SEE AND APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR AND HER STAFF FOR MEETING WITH US LAST WEEK. AS WE CONTINUE TO ANALYZE THE BILL AND ITS RELATED POLICY IMPLICATIONS. A GOOD MORNING SANDRA BORRERO ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION AND SUPPORT. Q.. ANY OTHER FOLKS ARE AND I DIDN'T I WASN'T AS CLEAR AS I SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABOUT SPEAKING. IN SUPPORT. OR IN OPPOSITION. STATE CATALDO REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA SOCIETY OF INDUSTRIAL MEDICINE AND SURGERY. THE CALIFORNIA NEUROLOGY SOCIETY IN THE CALIFORNIA SOCIETY FOR PHYSICAL MEDICINE REHABILITATION SUPPORT THE BILL. ANYONE ELSE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. ANYONE ELSE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION OR NEUTRALITY. AND. MISS FLETCHER IF YOU COULD ADDRESS I GUESS THERE'S A A SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS. I AM HAPPY TO TAKE THE TECHNICAL AMENDMENT THAT THAT'S. AND APPROPRIATIONS THAT'S WHERE I'LL TAKE IT. YES. WHO SOUNDS LIKE SORT OF? SOUNDS LIKE WHEN I I I CAN TALK TO THAT CHAIR IN A. IF YES WOULD BE HAPPY TO THAT'S A GOOD POINT SOUNDS LIKE A WINNER. ANYTHING ELSE YOU'D LIKE TO SAY OR DO YOU WANT A CLOSER QUESTION I THINK SORRY. NO THERE IS A REALLY QUESTION I JUST WANTED TO. TO. APPLIED THE AUTHOR FOR FREER. TAKING THIS BILL THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME THE BOTTOM LINE IS. AGREE TO HAVE A ZERO PERCENT RATING. FOR IN ANY INJURY THAT REQUIRES YOU TO IT EXTRACT TISSUE AND LEAVES YOU INJURED BECAUSE THEM THE MUSCLES ARE NOT THE SAME. THE WAY THAT YOU'RE PIERCE YOUR STRUCTURE IS SET UP IS NOT THE SAME. IT IT THIS IS REALLY I THINK REALLY REALLY VERY IMPORTANCE I WANT TO ADD ON IS A CO AUTHOR IF YOU WILL ACCEPT THAT. AND JUST SAY THAT ARE A PART OF THAT TYPE PART OF THE CHALLENGE IS TO BE ABLE TO LOOK AT AT THIS AREA AND TO SAY WHAT WHAT IS THE VALUE. OF OF THE INJURY. HOW DOES IT RELATE DIFFERENTLY MEN TO WOMEN AND REALLY THE CREATED EQUAL FAIL BECAUSE RIVER BEFORE REALLY GOING TO GET WOMEN AND NONTRADITIONAL? EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES AND WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO TREAT THEM WITH THE SAME RESPECT IN THE SAME KIND OF. SUPPORT. AS THEY DO THEIR JOB AND AND I'VE GOT TO THINK THAT I'M I KNOW A NUMBER OF WOMEN THAT HAVE HAD MASTECTOMIES ON THEY DON'T HAVE THE STRENGTH. AND THE ABILITIES THAT THEY HAD BEFORE AND THAT'S IT WORKERS COMP IS BOAST COMPENSATE FOR IS TO GIVE YOU. BUT YOU BACK AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE AND THEN GIVE YOU THE ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO DO YOUR WORK. ON WITH. WITH THAT NEW CAPACITY SO THANK YOU FOR DOING THIS I JUST WANTED TO. TO ECHO WHAT'S BEEN SAID THINKING. THANKS. WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE I JUST. RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AYE VOTE AND HOPE THAT I CAN. QUIT HAVING HEARINGS AND TALKING ABOUT THE VALUE OF BRASS JUST. WOULD BE GOOD TO ALLOW THAT TO BE PROFESSIONAL HONEST. I'M RECOMMENDING OF. SUPPORT VOTE HERE. WE APPROVED A SIMILAR BILL LAST YEAR WE VOTED ON THE FLOOR THE PREVIOUS YEAR. THAT MOST OF US WHO WERE HERE. SUPPORTED THAT BILL SO I SALUTE YOUR CONTINUING EFFORTS AND LET'S HOPE THIS TIME A. THE IN. IS RESOLVED. THERE'S MOTION SECOND ALREADY SIR SO LET'S VOTE.
