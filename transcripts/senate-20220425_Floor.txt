SECRETARY PLEASE READ SENATE RESOLUTION EIGHTY ONE BY SENATOR LIMÓN RELATIVE TO SEXUAL ASSAULT. CEREMONY THANK YOU COLLEAGUES I'M PROUD TO PRESENT SR EIGHTY ONE WHICH RECOGNISES THIS WEDNESDAY APRIL TWENTY SEVENTH AS A DAY. UNFORTUNATELY MANY PEOPLE ALL AND- GENDERS AND AGES HAVE BEEN VICTIMS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT. ONE IN TWO WOMEN AND ONE IN FIVE MEN HAVE EXPERIENCED SEXUAL VIOLENCE OTHER THAN RAPE IN THEIR LIFETIME. SEXUAL ASSAULTS CAN BE HEAVY MEDIA AND LONG LASTING CONSEQUENCES INCLUDING PTSD SUBSTANCE ABUSE MAJOR DEPRESSION HOMELESSNESS EATING DISORDERS LOW SELF ESTEEM AND SUICIDE. IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT A MAN SEXUALLY ASSAULTED AN EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD WOMAN THE ITALIAN SUPREME COURT OVERTURNED HIS CONVICTION BECAUSE SHE WORE TIGHT JEANS. THEY ARGUED THAT BECAUSE SHE MAY HAVE HAD TO HELP HIM REMOVE THEM SHE CONSENTED. THE WOMEN OF THE ITALIAN PARLIAMENT IMMEDIATELY PROTESTING PROTESTED BY WEARING JEANS TO WORK INSPIRING DENIM DAYS AROUND THE WORLD. IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE CALIFORNIA TO FILL THE PROMISE OF DENIM DAY BY ENACTING ABNINE THIRTY NINE BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER SABRINA CERVANTES TO PROHIBIT A SURVIVOR'S MANNER OF DRESS FROM SERVING AS EVIDENCE OF CONSENT IN SEXUAL ASSAULT CASES. VICTIM BLAMING IT ALL TO HARM COMMON AND HARMFUL ATTITUDES ALLOW SEXUAL ASSAULT AND RAPE CRIMES TO PERSIST. SURVIVORS DESERVE TO BE TREATED WITH DIGNITY COMPASSION AND RESPECT WE MUST CONTINUE OUR COMMITMENT TO FOSTER HEALING AND INCREASE PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING OF THIS SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM. I HOPE YOU WILL ALL JOIN ME AND WEARING JEANS ON WEDNESDAY TO HELP COMMUNICATE THE MESSAGE THAT THERE IS NO EXCUSE AND NEVER AN INVITATION TO COMMIT RAPE. THANK YOU AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU CEREMONY MEMBERS DISCUSSION AND DEBATE SENATOR DELHI. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT MEMBERS MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ACROSS THE WORLD PARTICIPATE IN DENIM DAY BY WEARING JEANS WITH A PURPOSE TO SUPPORT SURVIVORS AND EDUCATE THEMSELVES AND OTHERS ABOUT ALL FORMS OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE. THEY DIDN'T A STORY BEGAN IN ITALY IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO WHEN AN EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD GIRL WAS RAPED BY A FORTY FIVE YEAR OLD. DRIVING INSTRUCTOR WHO WAS TAKING HER TO HER FIRST DRIVING LESSON. HE TOOK HER TO AN ISOLATED ROLE ROAD. PULLED HER OUT OF THE CAR AND REMOVED HER JEANS AND FORCEFULLY RAPED HER. SHE REPORTS THAT THE RAPE AND THE PERPETRATOR IS ARRESTED AND PROSECUTED. HE IS THEN CONVICTED OF RAPE AND SENTENCED TO JAIL. YEARS LATER HE APPEALED THE CONVICTION CLAIMING THAT HE HAD. THAT IT HAD BEEN CONSENT CONSENSUAL SEX I TALLIEN SUPREME COURT. OVERTURNED THE CONVICTION AND THE PERPETRATOR WAS RELEASED ARGUED THAT BECAUSE THE VICTIM WAS WEARING VERY TIGHT JEANS. SHE HAD HELPED TO REMOVE THEM AND BY REMOVING THE JEANS IT WAS NOT RAPE BUT CONSENSUAL SEX. THIS BECAME KNOWN THROUGHOUT ITALY AS THE JEAN ALIBI. IN RAGE BY THE VERDICT THE WOMEN AND I TALLIEN PARLIAMENT LAUNCHED A PROTEST WEARING JEANS ON THE STEPS OF THE SUPREME COURT. THE PROTEST WAS PICKED UP. BY INTERNATIONAL MEDIA WHICH INSPIRED THE CALIFORNIA SENATE AND ASSEMBLY TO DO THE SAME ON THE STEPS OF THE CAPITOL IN SACRAMENTO. ATTY OKAY Z. GEOGHAN'S EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF PEACE OVER VIOLENCE SAW THIS IN THE MEDIA AND THOUGHT EVERYONE SHOULD BE WEARING JEANS TO PROTEST ALL MYTHS. ABOUT WOMEN AND GIRLS WHO ARE RAPED. DENIM DAY IN LA WAS BORN THE FIRST IN AND DAY IN LA EVENT WAS HELD IN APRIL OF NINETEEN NINETY NINE AND CONTINUES AT LEAST ANNUALLY SINCE. THE POINT OF THIS RESOLUTION SR EIGHTY ONE. PROMOTES THE WELLNESS AND PREVENTION OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE INCLUDING APPOINT APPOINTMENTS IS RATE. STRANGER RAPE SEXUAL ASSAULT BY AN ISSUE BUT BY AN INTIMATE PARTNER GANG RAPE INCEST SERIAL RAPE. SEXUAL HARASSMENT CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE SEX TRAFFICKING AND STALKING THAT IS IN THIS RESOLUTION. IT IS CRUEL TO HOLD PERPETRATORS IS CRUCIAL TO HOLD PERPETRATORS RESPONSIBLE FOR SEXUAL ATTACKS AND PREVENTION OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE AT EVERY OPPORTUNITY. HARMFUL ATTITUDES ABOUT RAPE AND SEXUAL ASSAULT ALLOW THESE CRIMES TO RESIST ALLOWING SURVIVORS TO BE RE VICTIMIZED. THREE VICTIMS BLAMING ATTITUDE SOMETIMES UNRESPONSIVE GOVERNMENT SYSTEMS THAT IS ACTUALLY IN THIS RESOLUTION. MEMBERS I THINK THE HYPOCRISY IS THAT WE'RE WE'RE TAKING UP S. R. EIGHTY ONE WHEN JUST WEEKS AGO. CURRENTLY THE MOST EGREGIOUS FORMS OF HUMIC XING TRAFFICKING INVOLVING SEX ACTS IN THE COURSE OF CHILDREN FOR SEX ACTS IS DEFINED AS NON VIOLENT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. VICTIMS WERE EXPLOITED BY SEN TRAFFICKERS WHO FORCED THEM TO SELL THEIR BODIES. BORDER TRAFFICKERS FINANCIAL GAIN. TRAFFICKING VICTIMS ARE FREQUENTLY FORCED TO HAVE SEX WITH UPWARDS OF FIFTEEN STRANGERS A DAY AND FACING BEATINGS ON THE HANDS OF THEIR TRAFFICKERS. IN CALIFORNIA THAT IS NOT. A VIOLENT CRIME TODAY. SB TEN FORTY TWO WHICH FELL PASSAGE. IN THE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE JUST WEEKS AGO. WHAT FURTHER HOLD PERPETRATORS ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR CRIMES AND PREVENT WOMEN FROM BEING BIG COMING VICTIMS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING. SOME MEMBERS ON THIS FLOOR VOTED AGAINST THAT BILL. IT IS STILL IN THE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE TODAY WE CAN BRING THAT BILL UP UNDER SPECIALS. TO BE HEARD AGAIN THAT WILL SECURE OUT AND WE'RE FOR THIS BILL TODAY YOU SHOULD BE BUILDING VOTING FOR SP TEN FORTY TWO. WHICH WOULD MAKE IT A CRIME IN CALIFORNIA- A FELONY CRIME. IF YOU SEX TRAFFIC SOMEBODY INNER DALY UNFORTUNATELY I NEED TO STICK TO THE MERITS OF THIS I WOULD I WOULD URGE YOU TO VOTE FOR THIS BILL AND ALSO VOTE FOR SB TEN FORTY TWO. THANK YOU SIR FOLLOWED BY CENTER RUBIO SINNERS CAN. THANK YOU SO MUCH- MR PRESIDENT MEMBERS AYE REYES ON BEHALF OF THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS IN SUPPORT OF S. R. EIGHTY ONE. NOW AS I STRUGGLE TO FIND MY GLASSES THIS NO ONE INVITES HARASSMENT ABUSE ASSAULT OR RAPE. EFFORT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT OUR WARDROBE DECISIONS ARE OR OTHER ACTIVITIES WE DO NOT INVITE THAT TYPE OF ASSAULT AND THIS IS THE POINT OF DENIM DAY. WE ALL KNOW HAVE THE HIGH NUMBER OF SEXUAL ASSAULTS BUT WE MAY NOT REALIZE THE IMPLICATIONS OF THAT HIGH NUMBER. ONE STATE FOUND THAT 76% OF INCARCERATED WOMEN IN THAT STATE WERE SURVIVORS OF SEXUAL ABUSE BY THE AGE OF THIRTEEN SEVENTY. 6% WE ALSO KNOW THAT MANY MANY RAPES AND SEXUAL ASSAULTS GO UNREPORTED. THAT THE SHAME RELATED TO THIS OR THE FEELING THAT SOMEHOW HI THE PERSON WHO WAS ASSAULTED THAT SOMEHOW WE CONTRIBUTED TO IT HAPPENING IT WAS OUR FAULT WE THEN DON'T REPORT. NO THIS PREJUDICE ALSO PROVIDED LAW ENFORCEMENT FOR A LONG TIME AND WE FOUND THAT EVEN WHEN SEXUAL ASSAULTS AND RAPES WERE REPORTED THEY WERE NOT PRIORITIZED FOR ENFORCEMENT AND THE GREAT EXAMPLE OF WHAT THAT WAS. THOSE PEOPLE WHO WERE RAPED WHO WENT IN TO THE HOSPITAL AND GOT THE WHOLE KIT WHICH THE WHOLE EVIDENCE WHICH IS CALLED A RAPE KIT. THOSE RAPE KITS WERE LEFT ON SHELVES EVIDENCE SHOWS FOR YEARS UNTESTED. WE'VE CHANGE THAT NOW THE LEGISLATURE IS TAKEN OUT ON WE'RE FINDING OUR POLICE DEPARTMENTS WE ARE MADE IT A PRIORITY. AND WE ARE SEEING AN INCREASE NOT ONLY IN. THE THE ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS BUT ALSO IN THE CONVICTIONS THE CATCHING EVERY PERSON THE CONVICTIONS. AND WE HAVE TO ELIMINATE THESE TYPES OF PREJUDICES IN THESE ATTITUDES IN ORDER FOR ANYONE AND EVERYONE WHO EXPERIENCES A SEXUAL ASSAULT TO FEEL NO SHAME ABOUT REPORTING IT AND REALLY THAT IS THE POINT OF DENIM DAY. SO I VERY MUCH STAND IN SUPPORT AND ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU CENTER SKINNER CENTER RUBIO WILL BE FOLLOWED BY CENTER COME LONGER CENTER RUBIO. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF THE SENATE TODAY I RISE ON BEHALF OF THE JEWISH CAUCUS IN STRONG SUPPORT FOR S. R. EIGHTY ONE. WHICH RECOGNIZES APRIL TWENTY SEVEN TWENTY TWENTY TWO AS DOWN ON DAY IN CALIFORNIA THAT WE STAND WITH SEXUAL ASSAULT SURVIVORS IN THE WOMEN GIRLS AND OTHER INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE BEEN ASSAULTED ABUSED OR HARASSED. JUDAISM TEACHES THAT ALL PEOPLE ARE SACRED BEINGS TO BE PROTECTED AND NURTURED AND THAT TO ACT AGAINST HIM AND VIOLENCE. IS TO ACT AGAINST THE DIVINE AND THE JEWISH TRADITION TO COST ANOTHER PAIN OR MORAL DEGRADATION IS A CAN TO MURDER. WHEN WE REFUSED TO CONFRONT THESE BEHAVIORS WE ARE COMPLICIT. ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE A BYSTANDER. AS STATED EARLIER THE LEGISLATIVE WOMEN'S CAUCUS WAS PROUD TO SUPPORT A. B. NINE THIRTY NINE WHICH PROHIBITS THE SURVIVORS A TIRE TO BE USED AS EVIDENCE OF CONSENT IN SEXUAL ASSAULT CASES. THE CHANGE WAS LONG OVERDUE AGAIN THERE IS NEVER AN EXCUSE TO BE HARASSED ABUSED ASSAULTED. OR RATE. CHANGING THE SOCIAL NORMS THAT ALLOW THIS KIND OF BEHAVIOR IS IMPORTANT FOR CIVIL SOCIETY AND MAKING THIS CHANGE REQUIRES US TO CONTINUE TO WORK TO EDUCATE EVERYONE FROM CHILDREN FRIENDS FAMILIES THIS WEDNESDAY WE INVITE EVERYONE TO WEAR DENIM. IT IS A REALLY GOOD DAY TO SHOW THAT WE MUST SEND A STRONG MESSAGE THAT WE STAND WITH SURVIVORS AND VICTIMS FOR THIS REASON I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR S. R. EIGHTY ONE THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR RUBIO CENTER COME LONGER. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT AS VICE CHAIR OF THE BLACK CAUCUS I RISE IN SUPPORT OF SR EIGHTY ONE DENIM DAY. ONE OF THE STATED PURPOSES OF DENIM DAY IS TO EDUCATE OTHERS ABOUT SEXUAL VIOLENCE. A LITTLE HISTORY THAT SOMETIMES GETS OVERLOOKED IN THESE DISCUSSIONS IS THAT DURING THE EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS MOST STATES EXCLUDED BLACK WOMEN BOTH FREE AND ENSLAVED FROM WORK RATE LAWS SIXTY ONE THAT A BLACK WOMAN COULD EVEN FILE RAPE CHARGES AGAINST A WHITE MAN. BLACK WOMEN ARE ESPECIALLY VULNERABLE TO SEXUAL VIOLENCE DUE TO MULTIPLE SOURCES OF OPPRESSION. MORE THAN DURING OUR LIFETIMES. A LOT A HIGHER SHARE THAN AMONG WOMEN OVERALL. IN THE UNITED STATES SEXUAL VIOLENCE OTHER THAN RAPE BE SEXUALLY ABUSED BEFORE THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN. AMONG STUDENTS HIGH SCHOOL SAMPLE REPORTED HAVING BEEN RATE. 40% OF CONFIRM SEX TRAFFICKING SURVIVORS IN THE UNITED STATES ARE BLACK. ALL OF THESE STATISTICS ARE EVEN HIGHER FOR BLACK TRANS WOMEN AND FOR OUR BLACK BOYS THEY ARE ALSO RAPED AND SEXUALLY ASSAULTED AT ALARMING RATES. BLACK BOYS FIRST SEXUAL ENCOUNTER ON AVERAGE IS AT AGE NINE OR TEN FROM AN OLDER WOMAN. AND ONE IN SIX BLACK BOYS HAVE SUFFERED SEXUAL ABUSE. THESE ACTS ARE OFTEN MINIMIZED AND IN FACT SEEN AS RITE OF PASSAGE. BUT OUR BLACK BOYS ARE VICTIMS JUST LIKE OUR BLACK GIRLS. BECAUSE OF AFRICAN AMERICANS UNIQUE HISTORY OF RACIST AND SEXIST VICTIMIZATION THE BLACK COMMUNITY HAS AN EVEN HARDER TIME THAN OTHERS DEALING WITH RAPE AND SEXUAL VIOLENCE. THIS PREVENTS SURVIVORS FROM GETTING HELP AND THE COMMUNITY FROM ADDRESSING THESE ISSUES EFFECTIVELY AND HONESTLY. HOWEVER MOMENTS LIKE DENIM DAY INCREASE THE VISIBILITY OF THESE IMPORTANT ISSUES AND AMPLIFY AMPLIFY THE VOICES OF ALL OF OUR SURVIVORS. THE GOAL IS TO LEAD TO CHANGE AND LAWS AND ATTITUDES AS WE ALL CONTINUE TO STRIVE FOR EQUITABLE JUSTICE COLLEAGUES I ASK. FOR YOUR AYE VOTE FOR S. R. EIGHTY ONE. MEMBERS IS THERE ANY OTHER DISCUSSION AND DEBATE ON SR EIGHTY ONE FILE ITEM SEVENTY EIGHT ANY OTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. SEEING NONE CENTER ALONE YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU AND THANK YOU MEMBERS AND COLLEAGUES TO FOR ALL YOUR WORDS AND EXPERIENCES AND BACKGROUNDS ON WHY THIS IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT. DAY TO RECOGNIZE THANK YOU ALL OF THOSE WHO ARE WEARING DENIM NOW- IT TO RECOGNIZE THIS AND THOSE WHO WILL WEAR IT ON WEDNESDAY- WE ARE SENDING A MESSAGE NOT JUST TO MEN AND WOMEN WHO HAVE BEEN IMPACTED BY SEXUAL ASSAULT HERE IN CALIFORNIA BUT GLOBALLY. SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU CEREMONY MEMBERS SENATE RESOLUTION EIGHTY ONE QUALIFIES FOR UNANIMOUS ROLL CALL IS THERE ANY OBJECTION TO USING UNANIMOUS ROLL CALL.

TODAY WE ALSO MARKED THE FIRST APRIL TWENTY FOURTH ANNIVERSARY SINCE THE U. S. AND PRESIDENT BIDEN RECOGNIZED THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE. PRESIDENT BIDEN REJECTED TURKEY'S GAG RULE. THROUGHOUT HISTORY HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS OF PLAGUED OUR WORLD DIVERSE PEOPLE OF STRUGGLE TO SURVIVE IN A WORLD OFTEN FILLED WITH FEAR AND HATRED AND VIOLENCE WITHOUT UNIVERSAL RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS THE WORLD CANNOT ACHIEVE PEACE. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA STANDS ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF JUSTICE IT IS HOME TO THOSE WHO ARE TORN FROM THEIR HOMELANDS. THE ARMENIAN STORY IS PART OF THE GREATER STORY OF CALIFORNIA. THAT'S WHY I AM SO PROUD TO REPRESENT LITTLE ARMENIA AND MY DISTRICT WHERE SO MANY ARMENIANS HAVE CALLED HOME FOR DECADES. TODAY OUR SYMPATHY GOES TO ALL THE SURVIVORS OF THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE AND THEIR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN. AND ESPECIALLY TO THE NEARLY HALF A MILLION PEOPLE OF ARMENIAN DESCENT WERE PART OF OUR STATE. TODAY WAIT KNOWLEDGE THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND DEDICATION OF THE DESCENDANTS OF THE GENOCIDE VICTIMS WHO CONTINUE TO FIGHT FOR JUSTICE AND PLAY A VITAL ROLE IN CALIFORNIA'S ADVANCEMENT. THE GREAT STATE OF CALIFORNIA WILL NOT LET THEIR HISTORY BANISH.

I WANT TO THANK THE SENATOR FROM KANNADA FLINT RIDGE FOR THE LEADERSHIP ROLE HE HAS PLAYED IN THE SENATE. IN KEEPING THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE IN THE MINDS OF ALL PEOPLE AND I WANT TO END WITH A VERY SHORT WRITING BY WILLIAM SAROYAN WHO IS A WRITER POET FROM MY HOME AREA FRESNO. QUOTE I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE ANY POWER OF THE WORLD DESTROY THIS RACE THIS SMALL TRIBE OF UNIMPORTANT PEOPLE WHOSE WARS HAVE ALL BEEN FOUGHT AND LOST WHO STRUCTURES HAVE CRUMBLED. LITERATURE IS ON READ MUSIC AS AN HEARD AND PRAYERS FOR MORE ANSWERS. MY HEAD DESTROY ARMENIA SEE IF YOU CAN DO IT. SEND THEM INTO THE DESERT WITHOUT BREAD OR WATER.

THANK YOU CENTER DRAWS- SENATOR PORTANTINO. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS SEN I RISE- AT FIRST TO COMPLEMENT MY COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES ON HER ELOQUENT- WORDS IN QUOTING WILLIAM SAROYAN SO WONDERFULLY TODAY- I RISE IN SUPPORT OF S. R. EIGHTY TWO REAFFIRMING CALIFORNIA'S RECOGNITION OF THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE. DESIGNATING THE YEAR OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND THE MONTH OF APRIL FOR COMMEMORATION. EVERY YEAR ON APRIL TWENTY FOURTH THREE REMEMBER THE ONE POINT FIVE MILLION ARMENIANS HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF GREEKS ASSYRIANS AND OTHER CHRISTIANS MASSACRED BY THE OTTOMAN TURKISH EMPIRE FROM NINETEEN FIFTEEN. TO NINETEEN TWENTY THREE. WHEN YOU GO BACK TO YOUR OFFICES THE LEGISLATIVE ARMENIAN CAUCUS FOUNDATION WILL BE GIVING YOU A BOOK TITLED MY NAME IS RM BY WILLIAM SAROYAN- ALLUDED TO BY MY COLLEAGUE FROM LA. PLEASE READ IT AT YOUR LEISURE AND LEARN MORE ABOUT THE ARMENIAN PEOPLE FROM THIS GREAT WRITER. ON APRIL TWENTY FOURTH NINETEEN FIFTEEN. TWO HUNDRED FIFTY ARMENIAN POLITICAL RELIGIOUS AND EDUCATIONAL AND INTELLECTUAL LEADERS WERE ARRESTED IN IN STUMBLE BY THE LEADERS OF THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE. THEY WERE DEPORTED TO THE INTERIOR THE COMPANY COUNTRY AND MURDERED. ON THAT SAME DAY FIVE THOUSAND MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN WERE ROUNDED UP AND SLAUGHTERED ON THE STREETS AND IN THEIR HOMES. OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS THE TURKISH GOVERNMENT ORDERED THE DEPORTATION OF THE REMAINING ARMENIAN POPULATION IN THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE. TO CONCENTRATION CAMPS IN THE DESERT OF DINNERS OR- WOMEN AND CHILDREN WERE FORCED TO WALK OVER MOUNTAINS AND THROUGH DESERT. WITHOUT FOOD AND WITHOUT WATER. THEY WERE FREQUENTLY STRIPPED NAKED AND ABUSED THE INTENTION OF THE OTTOMANS WAS COMPLETE OBLITERATION OF THE ARMENIAN NATION. NOT ONLY IN THE NATION BUT ALSO ANY MEMORY OF THE ARMENIAN PEOPLE. BACK IN NINETEEN FIFTEEN THE WORD GENOCIDE THE WORD DIDN'T EVEN EXIST. HE WENT CONVENTION ON THE PREVENTION OF PUNISHMENT OF THE CRIME OF GENOCIDE WAS ONLY ADOPTED IN NINETEEN FORTY EIGHT IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE HOLOCAUST. AFTER A SPEECH IN NINETEEN THIRTY NINE ADOLF HITLER SAID. AFTER ALL WHO SPEAKS TODAY OF THE ANNIHILATION OF THE ARMENIANS. THE ANSWER THAT WE GIVE TODAY IS WE DO. ARMENIANS CONTINUE TO LIVE AND PROSPER IN ARMENIA ARTSAKH AND THEN THE ASPER AND IN CALIFORNIA LARGEST ARMENIAN AMERICAN POPULATION IN THE US AND MANY ARE THE CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN OF SURVIVORS OF THE GENOCIDE. THAT ENHANCE CULTURAL DIVERSITY MAKE ARTISTIC ECONOMIC AND ACADEMIC CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR GREAT STATE AFTER THE GENOCIDE THE TWO SUCCESSOR STATES OF THE GENOCIDE PERPETRATORS TURKEY AND AZERBAIJAN CONTINUOUSLY TRY TO IMPLEMENT THEIR GENOCIDAL AGENDA TOWARD THE ARMENIANS IN THE REPUBLIC OF ARMENIA AND ARTSAKH. WELL ARMENIAN R. TUCKER STILL RECOVERING FROM THE TWENTY TWENTY FORTY FOUR DAY WAR THE SHOOTINGS AND SMALL SCALE ATTACKS DO NOT STOP. EVEN TO THIS DAY. DURING MY LAST VISIT TO ARMENIA IN NOVEMBER I WAS HONORED TO VISIT ARTSAKH AND WAS DEEPLY AFFECTED BY MY TIME THERE I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO WITNESS THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE UNPROVOKED WAR. I SAW DESTROYED HOMES SCHOOLS RIDDLED WITH BLOOD WITH BULLET HOLES SCHOOLS. RIDDLED WITH BULLET HOLES WERE TODAY YOUNG STUDENTS PLAY IN THE BACKYARD TWO HUNDRED YARDS AWAY FROM AZARI CAMPS HOSPITALS AND CHURCHES LEVELED BY OURS JERRY SHELLING. I MET WITH LOCAL VILLAGERS ON THE BORDER SOLDIERS AND SURVIVORS OF THE WAR MANY OF WHOM THEMSELVES OUR GRAND CHILDREN OF THOSE WHO SURVIVED THE GENOCIDE. THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE INSTEAD OF BEING ABLE TO HEAL FROM THE TRAUMA. AND FORCE FOCUS ON REBUILDING FOR THE FUTURE GENERATIONS THEY'VE BEEN FORCED TO RELIVE THEIR MEMORIES OF THE CYCLE OF INTERGENERATIONAL TRAUMA CONTINUES. THESE MORE RECENT EVENTS ON THE SUNY CAN ARTS OCT BORDER MAKE ALL OF US REALIZE THAT THE AGGRESSION THE VIOLENCE TOWARDS THE ARMENIAN PEOPLE HAS NOT STOPPED. YES LAST YEAR PRESIDENT BIDEN OFFICIALLY RECOGNIZED THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE ADDING THE UNITED STATES TO THE DOZENS OF COUNTRIES THAT THEY'VE ACQUIRED THE ATROCITIES AGAINST ARMENIANS AN ACT OF GENOCIDE. WILD TURKEY MAY WANT TO TURN THE CHAPTER ON THE ARMENIAN MASSACRE OF NINETEEN FIFTEEN THE UNITED STATES AND CALIFORNIA. AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL COMMUTER WILL NOT FORGET THIS INTERNATIONAL CRIME AGAINST HUMANITY. THESE ATTEMPTS CONTINUE THE VIOLENCE CONTINUES THE GENOCIDAL INTENT CONTINUES AND WHAT STRUCK ME ABOUT THOSE VILLAGERS ON THE BORDER IS THERE NOT GOING ANYWHERE. THEY'RE GONNA STAND ON THEIR LAND THEY'RE GOING TO FIGHT ON THEIR LAND AND THEY'RE GONNA DIE ON THEIR LAND BECAUSE THEY HAVE SOVEREIGNTY OVER THEIR FEET. OVER THEIR HOMES OVER THEIR CULTURE AND AS SYRIAN TURKEY AGGRESSION ISN'T GOING TO TAKE THAT AWAY FROM THEM. AND SO A LINE FROM A POEM INSPIRED ME IT SAYS WE ARE FEW. BUT WE ARE CALLED ARMENIANS BY SUFFOLK. GONG ET LES NINE- THERE SHOT THE NON. WE ARE WE SHALL BE AND WE MAY BE CUT AND WE MAY BE MANY LET THERE BE PEACE PLEASE LET THERE BE PEACE. ADVANCE OR NAY. THANK YOU SIR PORTANTINO SENATOR WIENER. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT OUR COLLEAGUES I RISE TODAY AS VICE CHAIR OF THE JEWISH CAUCUS IN SUPPORT OF S. R. EIGHTY TWO- AND IN OPPOSITION- TO GENOCIDE DENIALISM- THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE IS A HORROR OF HISTORY AND ONE THAT TRAGICALLY IS ALL TOO OFTEN EITHER IGNORED OR INTENTIONALLY OR RACE. HISTORY HAS SHOWN US AGAIN AND AGAIN WHAT HPPENS WHEN WE DO NOT TAKE THE TIME TO REMEMBER THE TRAGEDIES OF OUR PASSED OVER ONE MILLION PEOPLE WERE MURDERED- TO SAY NOTHING OF THOSE EXILED FORCIBLY CONVERTED OR OTHERWISE BRUTALIZED BY THE OTTOMANS. IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE RECOGNIZE THE GENOCIDE DO NOT JUST LIVING IN THE PAST THIS IS NOT JUST HISTORY. GENOCIDES ARE HAPPENING TODAY. THEY CONTINUE TO HAPPEN YEAR AFTER YEAR. WHEN WE ALLOW GENOCIDE TO GO ON CHALLENGES BOTH PERPETUATES THE VIOLENCE- SIMULTANEOUSLY DENYING THE REALITY FELT BY THOSE IMPACTED. AND LITERALLY ALLOWING FOR THE AGGRESSION TO CONTINUE ENABLING THOSE WHO MAY WANT TO DO THE SAME. AND THEY LOOKED TO SILENCE TO ENCOURAGE THEM TO DO THE SAME. THE **** AS YOU JUST HEARD LOOKED UPON THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE AS A SUCCESS. AS A MODEL FOR THE ATROCITIES THAT THEY WERE GOING TO COMMIT. IN THE EXTERMINATION OF SIX MILLION JEWS JEWS AND MILLIONS OF NON JEWS. HILDER DIRECTLY CITED THE FATE OF THE ARMENIANS AS A REASON FOR WHY HIS PLAN IN EUROPE WOULD SUCCEED. WHEN WE DID. WHEN WE ENABLE THE DENIAL OF THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE WE STOKED THE FIRES OF A HISTORICISM OF FLAME THAT BURNS ALL OF US AND CONTINUES TO RESULT IN THE DEATH OF PEOPLE TODAY. WHETHER IT'S UNITED STATES OWN DARK HISTORY WITH RACISM IN THE ERASURE OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLES THE HOLOCAUST OR THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE WE MUST HONOR THE LIVES LOST AND SPEAK TRUTH SO THAT IT NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN I ASKED FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SIR WIENER SENATOR MEN TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES FROM LOS ANGELES BY COMING OUT OF FLINT RIDGE AND SANTA CLARITA FOR BRINGING THIS RESOLUTION FORWARD- AS A PHILOSOPHER SANTAYANA ONCE SAID. THOSE WHO CANNOT REMEMBER THE PAST ARE CONDEMNED TO REPEAT IT AND AS HAS BEEN MENTIONED ELOQUENTLY BY MY COLLEAGUES WE HAVE SEEN GENOCIDES POP UP PERIODICALLY THROUGHOUT HISTORY- WE ALWAYS ASK OURSELVES HOW COULD THIS HAVE HAPPENED I WORK WE'VE DONE TO PREVENT IT AND I THINK ONE KEY ASPECT OF THIS IS. HOPE REMEMBERING OUR HISTORY HOLDING ACCOUNT OF ONE IN THIS CASE REMEMBERING THE HISTORY OF THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE BY THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE BY THE- POPULATION IT NOW COMPRISES TURKEY OPPORTUNITY GIVEN THAT TURKEY HAS REFUSED TO RECOGNIZE THIS SO I WOULD ASK ME COOPER THIS RESOLUTION AND I URGE MY COLLEAGUES TO VOTE I. THANK YOU CENTER MEN SENATOR ARCHULETA. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT I RISE AND SUPPORT US S. R. EIGHTY TWO. IT TOUCHES HOME THE CITY OF MONTEBELLO IN MY DISTRICT THE LARGEST MONUMENT I THINK THAT THE ARMENIANS HAVE DIRECTED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE GENOCIDE IN ARMENIANS COME FROM ALL OVER THE STATE- EVERY YEAR AS YOU'RE A KNOWLEDGE IN NOW A HUNDRED AND SEVEN YEARS. AND I WAS WITH THEM ON SATURDAY NIGHT HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE THERE. NOT JUST ARMENIANS PEOPLE FROM IN THE ENTIRE AREA CAME TOGETHER TO PRAY TOGETHER AND ACKNOWLEDGE THE SUFFERING THAT IS STILL IN THE HEARTS OF THE DESCENDANTS GRANDPARENTS WHO ARE NO LONGER WITH THEM. THE ERRORS THAT ARE HERE LIVING AND WORKING IN THE CITY OF PICO RIVERA MY HOMETOWN THERE'S A SMALL SCHOOL IN ITS STARTS IN KINDERGARTEN GOES ALL THE WAY TO HIGH SCHOOL AND IT IS ONE OF THE MOST ESTABLISHED ARMENIAN SCHOOLS IN THE STATE. AND I BELIEVE IT MIGHT EVEN BE THE FIRST AND THEIR GRADUATES ARE ALUMNI DOCTORS LAWYERS ENGINEERS TEACHERS CONTRACTORS POLITICIAN YOU NAME IT THEY HAVE SERVED OUR COUNTRY IN THE MILITARY AS WELL. AND WHEN I ADDRESSED THE CROWD THERE IN IN MONTEBELLO I KNOWLEDGE. AS AMERICANS ALL OF US STAND TOGETHER WE WILL NEVER LET THIS HAPPEN AGAIN. AND I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD IN IT IS TRULY SOMETHING THAT WE CAN COME THE GUY BEHIND AS AMERICANS AND I'M SO PROUD THEY WERE ALL STANDING FOR S. R. EIGHTY TWO I REGION OF. AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SAID ARCHULETA CENTER BOARD JUST. COLLEAGUES I THINK. I THINK ALL OF US HAVE WHETHER IT'S TODAY OR IN THE PAST NUMBER OF YEARS- HAVE EXPRESSED OUR SOLIDARITY WITH THE ARMENIANS AND THE ARMENIAN AMERICANS- SOME OF YOU MAY RECALL THAT- MY- MY WIFE'S GRANDMOTHER WAS A GENOCIDE SURVIVOR SHE SURVIVED AS AN EIGHT YEAR OLD THE BURNING OF SMYRNA. BEFORE THE- THEY FOUND REFUGE IN GREECE AND ACTUALLY COMING OVER TO THE US BACK IN THE SEVENTIES BUT I WAS ACTUALLY ASKED A QUESTION RECENTLY. WHAT DOES IT MATTER. THAT BIDEN ACKNOWLEDGED BONTA- THAT WOULD OCCUR WAS GENOCIDE WHAT DOES IT MATTER WHAT CALIFORNIA. DOES IN THIS SPACE AS WELL AND IT KIND OF GOT ME THINKING OF FROM A LEGAL STANDPOINT. THERE ARE WHAT WE DO HERE IS OF REAL SIGNIFICANCE. AND SOME OF YOU THAT MAYBE- DID SOME WORK OR STUDY IN INTERNATIONAL LAW MAY RECALL A SERIES OF CASES THAT STEMMED FROM A PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT CAME FROM THIS BODY. A NUMBER OF YEARS BACK THAT ALLOWED SURVIVORS OF THE GENOCIDE EIGHT YEARS OF SURVIVORS. TO GO AFTER LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES- FOR THOSE LOST ONCE AND APPARENTLY THERE WAS- THERE IS A SERIES OF CASES CALLED- BOZTEPE AND IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY. AND IT WENT ALL THE WAY THROUGH BACK AND FORTH TO THE NINTH CIRCUIT I THINK TWO OR THREE TIMES IN THE ISSUE WAS. THE CALIFORNIA INSURANCE LAW THAT ALLOWED FOR AN EXTENSION OF THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE DESCENDANTS OF IN EIGHT YEARS OF THOSE WHO LOST THEIR LIVES DURING THE GENOCIDE. EXTENDED THE STATUE LIMITATIONS. IN THE ONE OF THE KEY REASONS WHY THIS NINTH CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS CASE FAILED. IS BECAUSE OF FIELD MATTER. ON OF FIELD MATTER- OVER THE SPACE OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS WHICH IS IN THE DOMAIN OF WASHINGTON SO THE QUESTION THAT WAS POSED TO THE NINTH CIRCUITIS WHAT IS AMERICA'S POSITION ON GENOCIDE. BECAUSE IF THERE'S AMBIGUITY AND AT THE TIME THERE WAS IF THERE IS M. B. UT IN THIS SPACE. THEN IT WAS A MATTER OF A POLITICAL QUESTION THAT DENIED THE NINTH CIRCUIT JURISDICTION OVER THIS MATTER THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED. SO FAST FORWARD YOU HAVE PRESIDENT BIDEN WHO KNOWLEDGES. THAT GENOCIDE OCCUR IN THAT HE REACHED THE AMBIGUITY OF AMERICA'S POSITION IN THIS MATTER. SO I FOUND THAT VERY INTERESTING FROM A FROM A LEGAL ASPECT AS WE COMMEMORATE- IN RECOGNIZE RATHER THE- WHAT WHAT OCCURRED BETWEEN NINETEEN FIFTEEN NINETEEN TWENTY TWO THAT MY LAST POINT IS. THE TWO TIMES THAT WE ALSO HAD SENATE BILLS WERE CALIFORNIA BILLS. TO DIVEST INVESTMENT IN THE REPUBLIC OF TURKEY. THAT SENDS A MESSAGE THAT SENDS A MESSAGE TO TURKEY THAT WE HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN THAT WE WILL USE THE INSTRUMENTS AND TOOLS AT OUR DISPOSAL TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT HISTORY IS PROPERLY WRITTEN. THE COLLEAGUES I JUST WANTED TO BRING THAT THAT THAT SMALL SIDE- STORY TOO WHAT IS A ONE THAT MATTERS OBVIOUSLY A LOT TO US INTERNALLY TO MY FAMILY AND- THOROUGHLY.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR PRESIDENT THAT IRISE TO ADJOURN IN MEMORY OF JOHN DUNLAP A FORMER SENATOR FOR THE NORTH BAY ONE OF OUR OWN WHOSE FAMILY IS UP ABOVE TODAY. JOHN WAS BORN IN SEPTEMBER ELEVENTH NINETEEN TWENTY TWO IN GREW UP ON THE DUNLAP FAMILY PRUNE RANCH IN YACHT BILL. JOHN ATTENDED NAPA HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATING IN NINETEEN FORTY. HE SERVED FOUR YEARS THE ARMY AIR CORPS FOR. IN A DIRT DURING THE SECOND WORLD WAR AFTER THE WAR HE EARNED HIS DEGREE AT UC BERKELEY AND WENT ON TO LAW SCHOOL AT UC HASTINGS. HE CAME FROM A LONG WIDER PUBLIC SERVANTS THE KROONSTAD LET FAMILY A HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR YEAR HISTORY OF LEGISLATIVE SERVICE BEGAN WITH JOHN'S GREAT GRANDFATHER NATHAN KUNZ. IN FACT HE ALSO FOUNDED THE CITY OF NAPA IN EIGHTEEN FORTY SEVEN. AND SERVED TWO TERMS IN THE ASSEMBLY KUN SERVE THE ASSEMBLY FROM. EIGHTEEN EIGHTY SIX TO NINETEEN THIRTY. AN UNCLE NATHAN F. COOMBS REPRESENT NAPA COUNTY IN THE SENATE FROM. NINETEEN FORTY EIGHT TO NINETEEN SIXTY JOHN SERVED IN THE ASSEMBLY. FROM. NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT TO NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR AND THEN THE SENATE FROM NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR TO NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT ALL OF JOHN'S ANCESTORS WERE REPUBLICANS WITH JOHN BEING THE ONLY DEMOCRAT. I WON'T COMMENT ANY FURTHER ON THAT. BUT WHAT A GREAT GUY JOHN'S HOME IN NAPA WITH THE SETTING WHEN THE LATE ENVIRONMENTALIST BILL QUORUM IN OTHERS CONCEIVED THE IDEA FOR PROPOSITION TWENTY WHICH WITH ITS NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO BALLOT MEASURE THEY CREATEDTHE STATE COASTAL COMMISSION AND TOOK CONTROL SEASIDE DEVELOPMENT AWAY FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. THE MEASURE WAS BACKED BY THEN SECRETARY OF STATE JERRY BROWN IN APPROVED BY 55% OF THE STATE'S VOTERS. TODAY JOHN IS REGARDED AS A PIONEER AND A VISIONARY AND SUPPORTING FARM WORKER RIGHTS AND PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT. HE WORK WITH GOVERNOR BROWN TO PASS A NINETEEN SEVENTY LAW THAT CREATED THE AGRICULTURE LABOR RELATIONS BOARD WHICH ESTABLISH COLLECTIVE BARGAINING RIGHTS FOR FARMWORKERS DURING A TIME WERE FARMWORKERS RIGHTS WERE NOT SO POPULAR. JOHN IS SURVIVED BY HIS WIFE MARY LOU HIS CHILDREN JANE DUNLAP OF ST PAUL MINNESOTA. PETER DUNLAP OF PETALUMA- I DAVID DUNLAP OF NAPA JILL DUNLAP GOALLESS OF SANTA ROSA HIS DAUGHTER IN LAW MARGARET DUNLAP OF PETALUMA AND HIS SON IN LAW P. GOES OF SANTA ROSA. AS WELL AS FIVE GRANDCHILDREN AND FIVE GREAT GRANDCHILDREN. YOU KNOW IT'S A POINT OF PERSONAL PRIVILEGE I DID GET TO KNOW THE CENTER OF WAY BEFORE I GOT INTO POLITICS- GOING OUT TO HIS HOUSE AND BEING HIS WATER GUY. AND WORKING ON AS WELL IT WOULDN'T BE IT'S JUST SOMETHING THAT'S ALWAYS THE BEES ME ABOUT HOW SMART. THOUGHTFUL HONEST. AND HUMBLE MAN HE WAS BUT ALSO WITH A GREAT WIT AND SENSE OF HUMOR- JUST ABSOLUTELY AMAZING HUMAN BEING- I PLEASE JOIN ME IN A JOURNEY THE SENATE SESSION IN MEMORY OF A GREAT AMERICAN. A GREAT CALIFORNIA AND ONE OF OUR OWN SENATOR JOHN DUNLAP. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR DODD SENATOR NIELSEN ON THIS ITEM. MR PRESIDENT LADIES AND GENTLEMAN THE SENATE. I'M VERY HONORED TO BE ABLE TO RECOGNIZE JOHN DUNLAP HERE TODAY AS WE JOIN IN HIS MEMORY. HE IS INDEED A MEMORABLE MAN. FROM THE POLITICAL DYNASTY FROM NAPA COUNTY. IT'S NOT INCONSISTENT THAT JOHN MIGHT HAVE DEPARTED FROM HIS PREDECESSORS IN THIS FAMILY AND BECAME A DEMOCRAT. JOHN HAD THAT INDEPENDENT STREAK. WHEN WE RUN AGAINST OTHER EACH OTHER IN SEVENTY NINE. I ADMIRED SO MUCH THAT HE HAD BEEN A LITTLE BIT OUT OF TOUCH WITH THE AREA TO BE REPRESENTED HE CARRIED ON AUTHORED THE AGRICULTURAL LABOR RELATIONS ACT. THAT DISTRICT WAS VERY HEAVILY AGRICULTURAL THAT WAS NOT A POPULAR STAND TO TAKE IN THAT COUNTY. THAT DID NOT DETER JOHN DUNLAP ONE WHAT. HE CARRIED THAT. LEGISLATION PROUDLY. AND THAT LEGISLATION LIVES ON YET TODAY. THE AGRICULTURAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD GOVERNS THAT ACT. THE DAY AUTHORED. HE ALSO CARRIED MANY ENVIRONMENTAL BILLS AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM NAPA OF THE KNOWLEDGE MAJOR BILLS. THAT WAS NOT ALSO ONE OF THE MORE POPULAR THEMES. IN THOSE DAYS. NOR WAS HIS POSITION ON CRIMINAL JUSTICE CONVICTION. AN IDEA WITH THE RECIPIENT EARLY ON OF MY CAREER OF HIS WIT. ELECTION NIGHT HE CALLED ME. AND I WAS VERY GRACIOUS. AND I RESPONDED CENTER DUNLAP I WOULD CERTAINLY LIKE TO AVAIL MYSELF OF YOUR WISDOM AND ALL OF YOUR YEARS. ANY CAME BACK QUICKLY SAID WELL JIM YOU AND PAYING ATTENTION TO WHAT I SAID ANYWAY. WELL THAT ISN'T NECESSARILY SELL BECAUSE SKIPPING FORWARD MANY YEARS I WAS DEEPLY HONORED TO RECEIVE A CALL FROM SENATOR DUNLAP. INVITING ME TO COME AND SPEAK AT HIS POLITICAL SCIENCE CLASS AT NAPA COLLEGE. AND I COULDN'T HEAP ENOUGH PRAISE ON THE MAN. WE MAY HAVE DIFFERED POLITICALLY INTEGRITY NEVER QUESTION HIS COMMITMENT FEALTY TO HIS BELIEFS THOSE CORE BELIEFS THE COSTUME SOMETIMES TO BE OUT OF PART WITH OTHER PEOPLE IN HIS OWN FAMILY AND- SOMETIMES IN THE LEGISLATURE. BUT THAT WAS DONE THE WAY. HE LIVED A VERY PRODUCTIVE LIFE ALMOST IN ONE HUNDRED YEARS OLD. AND WE MADE IT A POINT TO STAY IN TOUCH FROM TIME TO TIME. AND I WOULD CALL THIS DAUGHTER AND ASK IF WOULD BE OKAY FOR ME TO CALL JOHN AND- CHAT WITH HIM. AND HE WAS ALWAYS VERY GRACIOUS WOULD TAKE THE CALL. THAT TAUGHT ME A LOT. ABOUT WHAT THE SENATE WAS ABOUT ASSEMBLY BUT THE HEAD OF ONE FULL TERM IN THE SENATE HE KNEW WHAT THE SENATE WAS ALL ABOUT. IT WAS ABOUT BIPARTISANSHIP. THE COURTESY AND RESPECT. HE CERTAINLY CARRIED HIMSELF IN THAT MANNER IN THIS INSTITUTION RECOGNIZE SENATOR JOHN DUNLAP HERE TODAY AS WE ADJOURN IN HIS HONOR. REGRESSED GODSPEED TO HIS FAMILY AS THEY CARRY ON THAT POLITICAL FAMILY IN NAPA COUNTY. GOD LOVE JOHN DUNLAP. THANK YOU SIR NIELSEN CENTER LAYERED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR PRESIDENT AND I THINK IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE LISTENING TO THE TALKS HERE ARE JUST A FEW PEOPLE THAT KNEW HIM HE HAS NOT BEEN IN THE SENATE IN FORTY FOUR YEARS.A AND HE HAD SUCH PERSONAL LONGEVITY AND POLITICAL LONGEVITY THE DESPITE MORE HONORABLE CALLING FROM NAPA WHO FOCUSED ON THE NAPA PART HE ALSO REPRESENTED VALLEJO AND SOLANO COUNTY AND HI I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL IN VALLEJO. WHEN JOHN DUNLAP WAS OUR ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND A LOT OF US WERE. THAT'S SCHOOL STUDENTS ABOUT TO GO UNDER COLLEGE CONCERNED ABOUT A PARTICULAR FOREIGN INVOLVEMENT THE UNITED STATES HAD AT THE TIME. AND HE CAME AND MET WITH US AND HE CAME AND TALKED TO ASSIDUOUS CEREBRAL HE WAS HONEST AS WAS SAID HE WAS HUMOROUS. AND I THINK HE WAS GOING TO TALK TO ANYBODY AND TRY TO WORK THEM THROUGH THE ISSUE. N. AS WAS SAID I MEAN HE WAS A WAITER ON THE COASTAL COMMISSION. THAT ACT IS CELEBRATING FIFTY TWO YEARS AND I KNOW WHEN THERE WAS A FIFTY YEAR ANNIVERSARY HE WAS ONE OF THE FEW PEOPLE THAT WAS AN AUTHOR OF THAT TO STILL BE AROUND AND I'M GLAD THAT HE HAD THE CHANCE. WHILE HE WAS ALIVE TO BE APPRECIATED FOR. AND HERE'S SOMETHING THAT WE I THINK SOMETIMES LOSE IN POLITICS. WHICH IS UP TO BE EVEN HANDED FRIENDLY USE THEIR WEB TO MAKE A POINT WE'LL TALK TO EVERYBODY WE'LL WORK THROUGH AN ISSUE. AND THE WORD HONORABLE TO AND USED IN FRONT OF ALL OUR NAMES ALL THE TIME. REALLY FITS HIM AND FIT HIM AS AN ELECTED OFFICIAL AND AS A HUMAN BEING AND SO I AM PROUD. TO RISE AND ADJOURNED IN HIS MEMORY. THANK YOU SIR LET MEMBERS WE ARE JOINED TODAY IN THE GALLERY BY MEMBERS OF THE DUNLOP FAMILY IF THEY CAN BE USED AS STAND BE RECOGNIZED THIS THIS AFTERNOON. AND IF- THE MEMBERS OF THE SENATE CAN.
