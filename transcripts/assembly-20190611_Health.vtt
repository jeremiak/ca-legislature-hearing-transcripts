00:27:39.224 --> 00:27:40.625
PROVIDE MEDICATION ABORTION ON

00:27:40.692 --> 00:27:43.194
CAMPUS AND WHAT THEY WOULD NEED.

00:27:43.261 --> 00:27:44.596
ALL THE UC AND CSU STUDENT

00:27:44.662 --> 00:27:45.997
HEALTH CENTERS ALREADY PROVIDE

00:27:46.064 --> 00:27:48.466
REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH SERVICES --

00:27:48.533 --> 00:27:50.168
THE EMPLOYEE OR CONTRACT WITH AT

00:27:50.235 --> 00:27:52.170
LEAST ONE POSITION -- WORDED

00:27:52.237 --> 00:27:54.072
VANCE PRACTICE CLINICIAN -- AND

00:27:54.139 --> 00:27:55.673
THEY HAVE THE NEEDED PHYSICAL

00:27:55.740 --> 00:27:57.242
SPACE TO PROVIDE THE SERVICE.

00:27:57.308 --> 00:27:58.243
IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO OFFER

00:27:58.309 --> 00:27:59.944
MEDICATION ABORTION THEY WOULD

00:28:00.011 --> 00:28:01.713
ALL NEED TRAINING -- THEY WITH

00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:03.114
THE ULTRASOUND IF THAT'S NEEDED --

00:28:03.181 --> 00:28:04.149
AND TWENTY FOUR HOUR TELEPHONE

00:28:04.215 --> 00:28:07.819

THEY DON'T ALREADY HAVE THAT SET

00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:09.354
UP.

00:28:09.421 --> 00:28:10.722
GIVEN THESE FINDINGS I BELIEVE

00:28:10.789 --> 00:28:11.356
THAT ABORTION COMPETE CARE ON

00:28:11.423 --> 00:28:12.791
CAMPUS IS NECESSARY TO IMPROVE

00:28:12.857 --> 00:28:14.292
ACCESS IN DECREASE BARRIERS FOR

00:28:14.359 --> 00:28:15.260
STUDENTS.

00:28:15.326 --> 00:28:16.594
AND I ALSO BELIEVE THAT WITH THE

00:28:16.661 --> 00:28:18.129
FUNDING THAT'S BEEN COMMITTED IT

00:28:18.196 --> 00:28:19.130
WOULD BE VERY FEASIBLE TO OFFER

00:28:19.197 --> 00:28:20.432
MEDICATION ABORTION AT THE

00:28:20.498 --> 00:28:21.533
STUDENT HEALTH CENTER.

00:28:21.599 --> 00:28:23.168
THERE'S NO REASON TO EXCLUDE

00:28:23.234 --> 00:28:25.003
MEDICATION ABORTION FROM THE

00:28:25.070 --> 00:28:27.305
CARE THAT IS ALREADY PROVIDED --

00:28:27.372 --> 00:28:29.207
AT STUDENT HEALTH CENTERS.

00:28:29.274 --> 00:28:29.841
SENATOR LEVIN NOTED MEDICATION

00:28:29.908 --> 00:28:30.975
PORTION IS SAFE AND SIMPLE TO

00:28:31.042 --> 00:28:32.844
PROVIDE OVER THREE POINT SEVEN

00:28:32.911 --> 00:28:33.912
MILLION WOMEN IN THE UNITED

00:28:33.978 --> 00:28:34.712
STATES OF HAD A MEDICATION

00:28:34.779 --> 00:28:35.447
ABORTION.

00:28:35.513 --> 00:28:36.781
AND SERIOUS COMPLICATIONS ARE

00:28:36.848 --> 00:28:38.516
VERY RARE IN FACT THE HEALTH

00:28:38.583 --> 00:28:40.251
RISKS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER

00:28:40.318 --> 00:28:41.519
FOR WOMEN WHO CHOOSE TO CONTINUE

00:28:41.586 --> 00:28:43.021
A PREGNANCY TO TERM.

00:28:43.088 --> 00:28:44.155
THAN THEY ARE FOR WOMEN WHO

00:28:44.222 --> 00:28:45.790
CHOOSE MEDICATION ABORTION.

00:28:45.857 --> 00:28:47.292
JUST TWO MONTHS AGO.

00:28:47.358 --> 00:28:48.860
THE FDA APPROVED A NEW GENERIC

00:28:48.927 --> 00:28:50.161
FORM OF MIFEPRISTONE WHICH IS

00:28:50.228 --> 00:28:51.463
THE MAIN DRUG USED MEDICATION

00:28:51.529 --> 00:28:53.498
ABORTION FURTHER CONFIRMING THE

00:28:53.565 --> 00:28:56.234
AGENCY'S VIEW THAT THIS IS A

00:28:56.301 --> 00:28:56.734
VERY SAFE AND EFFECTIVE

00:28:56.801 --> 00:28:57.268
TREATMENT.

00:28:57.335 --> 00:28:58.870
THOUSANDS OF UC AND CSU STUDENTS

00:28:58.937 --> 00:28:59.971
GET PREGNANT EACH YEAR WHILE

ATTENDING SCHOOL AND WITH THE

00:29:01.973 --> 00:29:03.141

00:29:03.208 --> 00:29:05.143
LEGISLATION WILL MAKE POSSIBLE I

00:29:05.210 --> 00:29:05.910
BELIEVE THAT NOT ONLY WILL

00:29:05.977 --> 00:29:07.645
ABORTION ACCESS BE EXPANDED FOR

00:29:07.712 --> 00:29:09.180

WITH MEDICAL ABORTION I COLLEGE

00:43:28.505 --> 00:43:30.174
CAMPUSES WHAT WILL BE THE RISK

00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:31.742
FOR PATIENTS WITH MEDICAL

00:43:31.809 --> 00:43:32.776
ABORTION WE FIND THAT

00:43:32.843 --> 00:43:35.079
COMPLICATIONS ARE NOT SO RARE.

00:43:35.145 --> 00:43:36.647
WOMEN WHO TAKE MIFEPRISTONE FOR

00:43:36.714 --> 00:43:38.816

OF HEMORRHAGE IN FATAL INFECTION

00:43:39.917 --> 00:43:41.251
THE MORE FAILURES REQUIRING

00:43:44.722 --> 00:43:46.256
THE COMPLICATION RATE.

00:43:46.323 --> 00:43:47.491
INCLUDING CASES OF HEMORRHAGE

00:43:47.558 --> 00:43:49.193
INFECTION OR SURGERY WAS

00:43:49.259 --> 00:43:51.095
PERFORMED IS IN MOST STUDIES

00:43:51.161 --> 00:43:52.596
326% AND I'VE FILED MY

00:43:55.566 --> 00:43:56.333
IN ONE STUDY THE RATE OF IMAGE

00:43:56.400 --> 00:43:59.536
WAS 15% ANOTHER 17% OF PATIENTS

00:43:59.603 --> 00:44:00.537
REQUIRED SURGERY.

00:44:00.604 --> 00:44:02.106
COMPLICATION RATES COULD BE EVEN

00:44:02.172 --> 00:44:03.507
HIGHER THAN WE FIND OF THE

00:44:03.574 --> 00:44:04.108
LITERATURE BECAUSE OF

00:44:04.174 --> 00:44:05.943
DIFFICULTIES WITH BILLING CODES

00:44:06.010 --> 00:44:07.344
IN LARGE NUMBERS OF PATIENTS

00:44:07.411 --> 00:44:08.679
LOST TO FOLLOW UP IN SOME

00:44:08.746 --> 00:44:09.780
STUDIES.

00:44:09.847 --> 00:44:11.315
SO ROUGHLY ONE OUT OF EVERY

00:44:11.382 --> 00:44:12.483
TWENTY WOMEN WHO HAVE MEDICAL

00:44:12.549 --> 00:44:13.350
ABORTION WILL HAVE A

00:44:13.417 --> 00:44:14.818
COMPLICATIONS SUCH AS BLEEDING

00:44:14.885 --> 00:44:16.086
SOMETIMES RECORDING A BLOOD

00:44:16.153 --> 00:44:16.854
TRANSFUSION.

00:44:16.920 --> 00:44:18.555
AND OR NEED NEED FOR SURGERY

00:44:18.622 --> 00:44:20.958
BECAUSE OF PREGNANCY TISSUE LEFT

00:44:21.025 --> 00:44:22.359
INSIDE THE UTERUS.

00:44:22.426 --> 00:44:24.061
BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND IN THE END

00:44:24.128 --> 00:44:25.696
OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THERE

00:44:25.763 --> 00:44:27.197
WERE FOUR THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED

00:44:27.264 --> 00:44:27.765
NINETY FIVE ADVERSE EVENTS

00:44:27.831 --> 00:44:29.933
REPORTED TO THE FDA INCLUDING

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:31.368
TWENTY FOUR DEATHS NINETY SEVEN

00:44:31.435 --> 00:44:32.302
ECTOPIC PREGNANCIES.

00:44:32.369 --> 00:44:34.038
OVER THOUSAND HOSPITALIZATIONS

00:44:34.104 --> 00:44:36.540
EXCLUDING DEATHS IN FOUR HUNDRED

00:44:36.607 --> 00:44:38.075
NINETY NINE BUT TRANSFUSIONS AND

00:44:38.142 --> 00:44:39.243
FORMER TWELVE INFECTIONS.

00:44:39.309 --> 00:44:41.011
I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT

00:44:41.078 --> 00:44:45.015
THESE ADVERSE EVENT REPORTS.

00:44:45.082 --> 00:44:47.684
I HAVE A WHOLE SIX MINUTES.

00:44:47.751 --> 00:44:49.620
THE SEVENTY THREE YOU HAVE THREE

00:44:49.686 --> 00:44:52.423
MINUTES OKAY -- SO THE THE

00:44:52.489 --> 00:44:54.191
BOTTOM LINE HERE IS THAT SOME

00:44:54.258 --> 00:44:57.094
COMPLICATIONS ARE GOING TO OCCUR.

00:44:57.161 --> 00:45:01.265
AND THE QUESTION IS ARE WE READY

00:45:01.331 --> 00:45:02.566
TO HANDLE THOSE COMPLICATIONS.

00:45:02.633 --> 00:45:03.767
CONTINUITY OF CARE SOMETHING WE

00:45:03.834 --> 00:45:04.501
STRIVE FOR AND SAFEGUARD

00:45:04.568 --> 00:45:05.969

00:45:07.771 --> 00:45:08.839
PATIENTS HAVING COMPLICATIONS

00:45:08.906 --> 00:45:10.074
SOMETIMES FIND THAT THE CLINIC

00:45:10.140 --> 00:45:11.608
IS CLOSED AND SHOW UP IN THE

00:45:11.675 --> 00:45:12.576
EMERGENCY ROOM.

00:45:12.643 --> 00:45:13.844
IF IF THE TWENTY FOUR HOUR

00:45:13.911 --> 00:45:14.945
HOTLINE IS TELLING PATIENTS TO

00:45:15.012 --> 00:45:16.647
GO TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM IT'S

00:45:16.713 --> 00:45:19.516
NOT GOOD CONTINUITY OF CARE --

00:45:19.583 --> 00:45:21.318
ULTRASOUND -- PROCEDURES NEED

00:45:21.385 --> 00:45:24.288
SUPERVISION TRAINING DOCTORS AND

00:45:24.354 --> 00:45:24.822
NURSES TO DO THAT WILL BE

00:45:24.888 --> 00:45:26.523
DIFFICULT.

00:45:26.590 --> 00:45:27.424
AND OF WE'RE REQUIRE A LARGE

00:45:27.491 --> 00:45:30.494
VOLUME OF PATIENTS -- FOR

00:45:30.561 --> 00:45:31.929

SO -- I KNOW THE GOVERNOR VETOED

00:54:14.784 --> 00:54:16.219
THE BILL BEFORE.

00:54:16.286 --> 00:54:18.855
NO WAS BASED ON THE FACT THAT.

00:54:18.922 --> 00:54:21.658
THERE'S SERVICES WITHIN UNDER

00:54:21.725 --> 00:54:25.161

HE DEEMED THE BILL ON NECESSARY

00:54:35.305 --> 00:54:36.306
AND I'M JUST WONDERING WHAT

00:54:36.373 --> 00:54:38.508
WOULD BE.

00:54:38.575 --> 00:54:41.544
NOTHING'S CHANGED IN THAT REGARD.

00:54:41.611 --> 00:54:43.346
AS I STATED IN MY OPENING I

00:54:43.413 --> 00:54:45.081
PROFOUNDLY DISAGREE WITH THE

00:54:45.148 --> 00:54:47.317
GOVERNOR AND IT'S NOT MEDICAID

00:54:47.384 --> 00:54:49.319
ABORTION OR PORTION IN FACT IS

NOT READILY AVAILABLE -- WITHIN

ALL THIRTY FOUR CAMPUSES SO THE

00:54:53.890 --> 00:54:55.825
GOVERNOR AND I DON'T AGREE HE

I KNOW THE GOAL HAS ALWAYS BEEN

00:55:01.598 --> 00:55:04.067
TO MAKE ABORTION RARE.

00:55:04.134 --> 00:55:07.070
BUT DOING THIS WILL ACTUALLY.

00:55:07.137 --> 00:55:10.173
MAKE IT EASIER SO I'M JUST YOU

00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:11.041

00:55:11.107 --> 00:55:13.043
STATEMENT OF MINE.

00:55:13.109 --> 00:55:15.912
BUT I WANTED TO ASK THE DOCTOR --

00:55:15.979 --> 00:55:16.846
THE OP OPPONENTS.

AT AND I'VE YOU KNOW DONE

00:55:25.088 --> 00:55:26.322
RESEARCH BECAUSE I HAD A BILL

00:55:26.389 --> 00:55:28.191
COUPLE YEARS AGO REGARDING THE

00:55:28.258 --> 00:55:29.492
ARE YOU.

AND YOU KNOW YOU WOULD NOW I

00:55:35.498 --> 00:55:38.268
MEAN IF SOMEONE TAKES THIS

00:55:38.334 --> 00:55:40.170
MEDICATION.

00:55:40.236 --> 00:55:42.138
THERE'S GOING TO BE BLEEDING.

00:55:42.205 --> 00:55:43.039
THERE'S GOING TO BE PAYING

00:55:43.106 --> 00:55:47.177
THERE'S GOING TO BE -- POSSIBLE

00:55:47.243 --> 00:55:48.712
ISSUES LIKE YOU SAID THERE'S

00:55:48.778 --> 00:55:51.347
SOMETIMES SEVERE CONDITIONS.

00:55:51.414 --> 00:55:52.749
BASICALLY THE BABY HAS TO BE

00:55:52.816 --> 00:55:55.218
EXPELLED.

00:55:55.285 --> 00:55:56.352
AND THAT COULD HAPPEN IN THE

00:55:56.419 --> 00:56:00.256
DORM BATHROOM WELL THE GIRL LONG.

00:56:00.323 --> 00:56:02.058
AND I'M A MOM AND I YOU KNOW

00:56:02.125 --> 00:56:04.961
THEY'RE CONSIDERED ADULTS AT

00:56:05.028 --> 00:56:06.629
EIGHTEEN AND YOU KNOW I HAVE A

00:56:06.696 --> 00:56:08.498
SON WHO'S EIGHTEEN AND IT'S HARD

00:56:08.565 --> 00:56:10.700
TO IMAGINE THAT THEY CAN.

00:56:10.767 --> 00:56:11.935
REALLY MAKE ADULT DECISIONS.

00:56:12.001 --> 00:56:13.570
BUT MY HEART GOES OUT TO THESE

00:56:13.636 --> 00:56:15.371
YOUNG WOMEN WHO WILL BE ALONE IN

00:56:15.438 --> 00:56:17.540
THE DORM [inaudible]

00:56:17.607 --> 00:56:19.342
EXPONENT CHILD.

00:56:19.409 --> 00:56:20.643
IN A AND ONE IS THE DOCTOR I

00:56:20.710 --> 00:56:24.581
MEAN WHAT HAPPENS.

00:56:24.647 --> 00:56:26.049
WHAT'S THE REALITY OF TAKING

00:56:26.116 --> 00:56:30.553
THIS PILL.

00:56:30.620 --> 00:56:32.088
THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION.

00:56:32.155 --> 00:56:34.357
IT IS TRUE THAT WHEN A WOMAN

00:56:34.424 --> 00:56:36.025
TAKES THE PILLS INVOLVED IN THE

00:56:36.092 --> 00:56:37.660
MEDICAL ABORTION PROCEDURE.

00:56:37.727 --> 00:56:39.062
SHE IS GOING TO EXPERIENCE

00:56:39.129 --> 00:56:40.430
PRETTY SEVERE CRAMPING VERY

00:56:40.497 --> 00:56:41.831
HEAVY BLEEDING THAT'S SOMETHING

00:56:41.898 --> 00:56:43.066
I THINK THAT WE ALL AGREE UPON

00:56:43.133 --> 00:56:45.435
THAT PATIENTS ARE INFORMED ABOUT.

00:56:45.502 --> 00:56:47.070
SOMETIMES THE BLEEDING IS SO

00:56:47.137 --> 00:56:49.005
SEVERE THAT PATIENTS NEED TO GO

00:56:49.072 --> 00:56:50.306
TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM SOMETIMES

00:56:50.373 --> 00:56:51.775
JUST FOR REASSURANCE THAT THERE

00:56:51.841 --> 00:56:53.143
THERE THERE'S NOT HEMORRHAGING

00:56:53.209 --> 00:56:54.310
TO THE POINT OF NEEDING.

00:56:54.377 --> 00:56:56.112
MEDICAL ASSISTANCE BUT SOMETIMES

00:56:56.179 --> 00:56:57.313
THEY ARE BLEEDING THAT HEAVILY

00:56:57.380 --> 00:56:58.982
THAT THEY DO NEED AN URGENT

00:56:59.048 --> 00:57:00.450
PROCEDURE. TO COMPLETE THE

00:57:00.517 --> 00:57:02.285
ABORTION TO REMOVE TISSUE FROM

00:57:02.352 --> 00:57:04.754
THE WOMB -- AND SOMETIMES EVEN A

00:57:04.821 --> 00:57:06.723
BLOOD TRANSFUSION THE FACT IS

00:57:06.790 --> 00:57:09.125
THAT IF CURRENTLY WOMEN IN

00:57:09.192 --> 00:57:11.427
CALIFORNIA UNIVERSITIES ARE IN

00:57:11.494 --> 00:57:12.762
LIVING SITUATIONS WHERE

00:57:12.829 --> 00:57:14.297
TRANSPORTATION IS DIFFICULT WHEN

00:57:14.364 --> 00:57:15.498
THEY DON'T HAVE A LOT OF SUPPORT

00:57:15.565 --> 00:57:16.266
THEY WOULD BE THE WORST

00:57:16.332 --> 00:57:17.834
CANDIDATES. FOR THIS KIND OF

00:57:17.901 --> 00:57:19.302
PROCEDURE THEY MAY END UP BY

00:57:19.369 --> 00:57:21.004
THEMSELVES BLEEDING HEAVILY IN A

00:57:21.070 --> 00:57:23.606
LOT OF PAIN MAYBE NOT ABLE.

00:57:23.673 --> 00:57:25.441
TO GET TO A PHONE OR GET TO TO

00:57:25.508 --> 00:57:27.343
THE HELP THEY NEED -- THEY WOULD

00:57:27.410 --> 00:57:31.080
BE THE THE WORST -- CANDIDATES

00:57:31.147 --> 00:57:32.949
FOR THIS KIND OF PROCEDURE AND

00:57:33.016 --> 00:57:33.883
AND IT'S GONNA REQUIRE AS I SAID

00:57:33.950 --> 00:57:35.652
MORE TIME FOR THEM TO COMPLETE

00:57:35.718 --> 00:57:37.320
THE ABORTION PROCEDURE THAN SAY

00:57:37.387 --> 00:57:38.555
IF THEY HAD GONE FIRST.

00:57:38.621 --> 00:57:40.957
A FIRST TRIMESTER SURGICAL

00:57:41.024 --> 00:57:42.025
ABORTION THANK YOU FOR THE

00:57:42.091 --> 00:57:44.727
QUESTION -- JUST AS A FOLLOW UP

00:57:44.794 --> 00:57:46.062
ASSEMBLY MEMBER MAY ALSO A MAN

00:57:46.129 --> 00:57:47.130
ALSO RESPOND.

00:57:47.197 --> 00:57:49.165
WHETHER OR NOT THIS PROCEDURE IS

00:57:49.232 --> 00:57:51.267
OFFERED ON CAMPUS WOMEN WILL

00:57:51.334 --> 00:57:53.136
STILL AND STUDENTS WILL STILL

00:57:53.203 --> 00:57:55.805
HAVE MEANT -- MEDICATED ABORTION

00:57:55.872 --> 00:57:57.574
THEY WILL GO OFF CAMPUS TO GET

00:57:57.640 --> 00:57:59.342
THE MEDICATION AND THEY WILL

00:57:59.409 --> 00:58:00.844
COME BACK AND THEY WILL STILL BE

00:58:00.910 --> 00:58:03.847
IN THEIR DORM ROOM SO THIS BILL

00:58:03.913 --> 00:58:06.683
DOES NOTHING TO CHANGE THAT.

00:58:06.749 --> 00:58:07.550
WELL.

00:58:07.617 --> 00:58:08.685
IT'S MAKING IT MUCH MORE

00:58:08.751 --> 00:58:10.587
AVAILABLE.

00:58:10.653 --> 00:58:11.921
ISN'T ISN'T THE POINT I WAS

00:58:11.988 --> 00:58:13.590
MAKING THAT IS CORRECT.

00:58:13.656 --> 00:58:14.724
WHAT KIND OF SUPERVISION IS

00:58:14.791 --> 00:58:16.960
THEIR MEDICALLY ON THE CAMPUS

00:58:17.026 --> 00:58:18.394
WHERE AT LEAST?

00:58:18.461 --> 00:58:20.763
YOU KNOW THEY GO TO A DOCTOR.

00:58:20.830 --> 00:58:22.966
THEY HAVE SOME WAY THEY CAN

00:58:23.032 --> 00:58:25.468
CONTACT THE DOCTOR -- FOR THE

00:58:25.535 --> 00:58:26.736
NURSE.

00:58:26.803 --> 00:58:27.470
AND THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO

00:58:27.537 --> 00:58:28.571
CONTACT THE HEALTH CENTER AS

00:58:28.638 --> 00:58:30.240
WELL.

00:58:30.306 --> 00:58:32.508
SO EVEN AFTER HOURS YES SIR IT

00:58:32.575 --> 00:58:34.010
WOULD BE SIMILAR TO A FEW IF

00:58:34.077 --> 00:58:35.478
THEY OBTAIN THE MEDICATION OFF

00:58:35.545 --> 00:58:37.213
CAMPUS AND SOMETHING HAPPENED AT

00:58:37.280 --> 00:58:38.882
ONE AM IN THE MORNING.

00:58:38.948 --> 00:58:39.449
THEY WOULD HAVE TO GO TO AN

00:58:39.515 --> 00:58:40.984
EMERGENCY ROOM WHETHER THEY

00:58:41.050 --> 00:58:43.152
OBTAIN THE MEDICATION ON CAMPUS

00:58:43.219 --> 00:58:45.021
OR OFF CAMPUS SO THAT DOESN'T

00:58:45.088 --> 00:58:46.656
CHANGE.

00:58:46.723 --> 00:58:49.425
SO THE I MEAN.

00:58:49.492 --> 00:58:51.828

PHYSICIAN.

00:58:54.898 --> 00:58:57.867

00:59:09.445 --> 00:59:13.750
HANDS.

I'M JUST YOU KNOW THE MOM IT'S

00:59:14.684 --> 00:59:17.387
SYSTEMATIC TO THINK OF A YOUNG

00:59:17.453 --> 00:59:19.155
GIRL ALONE.

00:59:19.222 --> 00:59:21.491

ME I JUST THINK?

00:59:22.692 --> 00:59:24.327
AND I'LL JUST MAKE MY STATEMENT

00:59:24.394 --> 00:59:26.095
SB THREE TWENTY DOES NOTHING FOR

00:59:26.162 --> 00:59:28.264
PREGNANT STUDENTS WHO WANT TO

DO SO.

00:59:31.234 --> 00:59:32.602
THE ONLY ASSISTANCE THE

00:59:32.669 --> 00:59:34.270
UNIVERSITY WILL GIVE THEM HIS.

00:59:34.337 --> 00:59:36.005
HAVING ABORTIONS SO WE ALREADY

00:59:36.072 --> 00:59:37.707
PROVIDE PREGNANCY COUNSELING

00:59:37.774 --> 00:59:40.143
COUNSELING ON ON A CAMPUS THAT

00:59:40.209 --> 00:59:41.411
WOULD NOT CHANGE.

00:59:41.477 --> 00:59:42.145
AND DID THEY REFER THEM TO

00:59:42.211 --> 00:59:45.381
CRISIS PREGNANCY CENTERS OR THEY

00:59:45.448 --> 00:59:46.749

IDENTIFY ANY OF OUR MEMBERS

01:24:11.780 --> 01:24:13.615
CURRENTLY THAT ARE NOT COVERING

01:24:13.681 --> 01:24:15.250
THIS AND TREATMENT I THINK THERE

01:24:15.316 --> 01:24:17.652
WERE SOME ISSUES AND

01:24:17.719 --> 01:24:19.320
CLARIFICATIONS THAT HAPPENED

01:24:19.387 --> 01:24:21.022
EARLIER THIS YEAR.

I KNOW THE INDIVIDUALLY PLANS

HAVE GONE INTO THE AUTHORS

01:24:23.691 --> 01:24:25.560
OFFICE TO TRY AND SHARE THAT.

01:24:25.627 --> 01:24:27.429
IT IS NOW COVERED -- MOST

01:24:27.495 --> 01:24:29.597
RECENTLY KAISER HAS ACKNOWLEDGED

01:24:29.664 --> 01:24:30.765
THAT IT IS COVERED THEREFORE IT

01:24:30.832 --> 01:24:33.034
IS A PART OF THE BENCHMARK PLAN.

01:24:33.101 --> 01:24:35.637
WITH THAT WE BELIEVE THAT BOTH --

01:24:35.703 --> 01:24:36.971
WITHIN THE INDIVIDUAL AND SMALL

01:24:37.038 --> 01:24:39.808
ROUP MARKET THAT WOULD BE --

01:24:39.874 --> 01:24:42.076
REQUIRED COVERAGE FOR ALL OTHER

01:24:42.143 --> 01:24:44.546
PLANS SO WE'D BE HAPPY TO WORK

01:24:44.612 --> 01:24:45.780
WITH THE SPONSORS THAT THERE'S

01:24:45.847 --> 01:24:47.415
INDIVIDUAL INSTANCES FOR WHICH

01:24:47.482 --> 01:24:48.983
WE CAN LEND SOME SUPPORT THROUGH

01:24:49.050 --> 01:24:50.185
THE PROCESS.

01:24:50.251 --> 01:24:51.619
BUT WE DO BELIEVE THAT IT IS A

01:24:51.686 --> 01:24:53.087
REQUIRED COVERAGE UNDER THE

01:24:53.154 --> 01:24:54.956

SO WITH THAT UNFORTUNATELY WE

01:24:57.759 --> 01:24:59.828
ARE IN OPPOSITION WE THINK IT'S

01:24:59.894 --> 01:25:01.563
UNNECESSARY IN THE CONTEXT THAT

01:25:01.629 --> 01:25:04.232
IF WE START -- TO CODIFY ALL

01:25:04.299 --> 01:25:06.634

01:25:06.701 --> 01:25:08.203

01:26:13.434 --> 01:26:14.802
IS THAT WHY IS THERE A PROBLEM

01:26:14.869 --> 01:26:17.338

EVERYBODY SHOULD BE DOING IT.

01:26:30.718 --> 01:26:32.487
WHY SHOULD WHY OTHER PLANTS THAT

ARE NOT CURRENTLY DOING THAT AND

01:26:35.223 --> 01:26:37.725
SO WHY SHOULD WE NOT STATE THIS

01:26:37.792 --> 01:26:42.363
INTO INTO LAW TO TO ENSURE THAT

01:26:42.430 --> 01:26:44.499
ITS IT THAT IT IS BEING FOLLOWED?

01:26:44.566 --> 01:26:45.600
I THINK A RESPONSE WOULD BE I

CODIFY EVERY INSTANCE FOR WHICH

01:26:59.080 --> 01:27:00.081
THERE WAS A ONE OFF WHERE THERE

01:27:00.148 --> 01:27:01.816
WAS A MISTAKE IN COVERAGE OR AN

01:27:01.883 --> 01:27:03.785
ISSUE.

01:27:03.851 --> 01:27:04.419
I MEAN I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE NOT

01:27:04.485 --> 01:27:04.986
SKINNER AND INSURANCE COULD

01:27:05.053 --> 01:27:05.620
WOULD LOOK LIKE I MEAN I THINK

01:27:05.687 --> 01:27:07.322
THAT'S WHAT OUR CONCERN IS THAT

01:27:07.388 --> 01:27:08.556
THERE'S A WHOLE REGULATORY.

01:27:08.623 --> 01:27:10.959

COVERAGE LOOKS LIKE AND THAT'S

01:27:15.797 --> 01:27:17.832
BETTER PLACED IN THAT REGULATORY

01:27:17.899 --> 01:27:20.034

01:27:22.937 --> 01:27:25.340
INDIVIDUALS AN OPPORTUNITY WHEN

01:27:25.406 --> 01:27:26.708
THERE ARE CONCERNS OR PROBLEMS

01:27:26.774 --> 01:27:27.976
LEGISLATING EVERY TIME THAT

01:27:28.042 --> 01:27:29.077

SOMETHING IS NECESSARY OR NOT

01:27:35.850 --> 01:27:36.985

DON'T WANT TO BE HERE EVERY YEAR.

01:27:48.329 --> 01:27:49.764
LOOKING AT DIFFERENT INDIVIDUAL

01:27:49.831 --> 01:27:51.499

OR MAYBE PEOPLE DON'T GET THE

01:27:57.338 --> 01:27:58.339
COVERAGE AND THAT'S I THINK THAT

01:27:58.406 --> 01:28:00.775
IS TO THE POINT OF WHAT THE

01:28:00.842 --> 01:28:03.678

01:28:03.745 --> 01:28:04.545
DISCOVERY OF ETIQUETTE.

01:28:04.612 --> 01:28:10.785
IF IT'S A COVERED BENEFIT -- I'M

SO I'M JUST.

01:28:12.320 --> 01:28:12.920
FIVE NINE AND I THINK THAT THERE

01:28:12.987 --> 01:28:14.322
ARE A VARIETY OF REASONS THAT

01:28:14.389 --> 01:28:15.123
COULD OCCUR.

01:28:15.189 --> 01:28:16.157
FOR A PLAN TO A WHEN REVIEWING

01:28:16.224 --> 01:28:17.892
THE REQUEST FOR ANY YOU KNOW A

01:28:17.959 --> 01:28:20.128
DEVICE OR INCLUDING THIS DEVICE.

01:28:20.194 --> 01:28:21.229

01:28:21.295 --> 01:28:22.463
INITIALLY THERE WASN'T ENOUGH

01:28:22.530 --> 01:28:23.865
INFORMATION SUBMITTED BY THE%

01:28:23.931 --> 01:28:26.134
PROVIDER TO DOCUMENT MEDICAL

01:28:26.200 --> 01:28:26.901
NECESSITY I MEAN THERE'S JUST

01:28:26.968 --> 01:28:28.870
DIFFERENT REASONS WHY THAT WOULD

01:28:28.936 --> 01:28:29.904
BE.

01:28:29.971 --> 01:28:31.372
THAT IT WOULD BE EXAMINED BY THE

01:28:31.439 --> 01:28:32.840
PLAN BUT AGAIN THAT'S WHY THERE

01:28:32.907 --> 01:28:35.910
IS THE INTERNAL APPEALS PROCESS.

01:28:35.977 --> 01:28:37.211
AND OF THE I AM OUR PROCESS AT

01:28:37.278 --> 01:28:37.879
THE DEPARTMENT TO KIND TO

01:28:37.945 --> 01:28:40.181

01:28:49.123 --> 01:28:50.058
