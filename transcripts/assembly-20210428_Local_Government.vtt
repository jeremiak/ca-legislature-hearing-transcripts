THAT HOUSING PRODUCTION IS A

00:48:10.754 --> 00:48:11.888
PRIORITY BY OVERHAULING THE

FIRST REQUIRE CITIES TO HAVE A

00:48:39.650 --> 00:48:41.018
THE CONSULTATION CITIES IN EACH

00:48:41.084 --> 00:48:42.819
CITY WILL WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE

00:48:42.886 --> 00:48:43.954

AND REVISING. STRATEGIES THAT

00:48:48.592 --> 00:48:49.760
ARE NOT WORKING. THE SECOND WAY

00:48:49.826 --> 00:48:51.895
IS AT THE BILL REQUIRES A CITY

00:48:51.962 --> 00:48:52.829
WHERE PRODUCTION HAS BEEN

00:48:52.896 --> 00:48:54.197
SUBSTANTIALLY BELOW THE

00:48:54.264 --> 00:48:56.166
REGIONAL AVERAGE TO DROP LOCAL

00:48:56.233 --> 00:48:57.467

00:49:08.645 --> 00:49:09.613
STRATEGIES WILL BETTER ENSURE

INFRASTRUCTURE A SEWER WATER

01:07:21.437 --> 01:07:24.106
PIPELINE- AND IT'S ALSO PART OF

01:07:24.173 --> 01:07:26.242
A REGIONAL PLAN THAT IS BEING

01:07:26.308 --> 01:07:28.144

FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE REMAINS- WE

03:07:21.363 --> 03:07:22.431
DO NOT BELIEVE THAT IT'S A

03:07:22.497 --> 03:07:24.700

03:07:40.248 --> 03:07:41.383
STRONGLY THAT NEEDS TO REMAIN

03:07:41.450 --> 03:07:43.151
THERE I'M THE ANALYSIS TO

03:07:43.218 --> 03:07:45.120
REALLY- APPROPRIATELY AND

03:07:45.187 --> 03:07:46.555

03:07:48.190 --> 03:07:49.658
OCCURRED IN RECENT YEARS TO THE

OTHER ACCOUNTABILITY ACT AND

03:07:51.059 --> 03:07:52.761
ALSO THE CREATION OF HDDS

03:07:52.828 --> 03:07:54.730
HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY YET FROM

03:07:54.796 --> 03:07:55.831
THESE CHANGES ARE SIGNIFICANT

03:07:55.897 --> 03:07:58.233
AND- I STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT

03:07:58.300 --> 03:07:59.501
OUR CITIES ARE ARE NOT YOU

03:07:59.568 --> 03:08:01.036

03:08:01.103 --> 03:08:02.571
INTENTIONALLY. IDENTIFIED HOW

03:08:02.638 --> 03:08:04.506
WE CAN ABILITY ACT IF THEY DO

03:08:04.573 --> 03:08:06.308
SO THEY WILL FACE A TEN

03:08:06.375 --> 03:08:07.142
THOUSAND DOLLAR PER UNITS

FINANCED FOR NOT FOLLOWING THAT

ADDITIONAL DELAYS AND

03:08:21.289 --> 03:08:22.758

03:08:25.127 --> 03:08:26.094
NOT RULE IN FAVOR OF THE CITY

03:08:26.161 --> 03:08:27.763
I'M SURE THAT OUR CITIES WILL

03:08:27.829 --> 03:08:29.031

03:10:00.756 --> 03:10:02.357
KNOWS. MY CITY HAS SPENT

03:10:02.424 --> 03:10:03.992
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TRYING TO

03:10:04.059 --> 03:10:06.428
GET IT RIGHT- AND SO I THINK

03:10:06.495 --> 03:10:07.929
THERE'S A VALUE IN CREATING

03:10:07.996 --> 03:10:09.364
THIS BODY I'M VERY HAPPY WITH

03:10:09.431 --> 03:10:10.699
THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS. OF

03:10:10.766 --> 03:10:11.366
TWO LOCAL GOVERNMENT

03:10:11.433 --> 03:10:13.335
REPRESENTATIVES- ON THIS

03:10:13.401 --> 03:10:14.402
APPEALS FOR BUT I HAVE A COUPLE

03:10:14.469 --> 03:10:16.338
QUESTIONS SO FIRST OF ALL DO WE

03:10:16.404 --> 03:10:18.140
KNOW HOW MANY CITIES HAVE BEEN

03:10:18.206 --> 03:10:21.877
ACCUSED AND- TAKEN TO COURT FOR

03:10:21.943 --> 03:10:22.644
VIOLATING HOUSING

03:10:22.711 --> 03:10:25.247
ACCOUNTABILITY ACT. LAST YEAR

03:10:25.313 --> 03:10:26.548
TOO YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW THE

03:10:26.615 --> 03:10:28.150
EXACT NUMBER I THINK WHAT WHAT

03:10:28.216 --> 03:10:29.918
THIS BILL IS GETTING OUT IS

03:10:29.985 --> 03:10:31.620
NINE THOSE INSTANCES WHERE EACH

03:10:31.686 --> 03:10:33.054
CD GETS INVOLVED BUT THOSE

03:10:33.121 --> 03:10:34.756
INSTANCES WHERE CITIES GET

03:10:34.823 --> 03:10:35.724
INVOLVED IN WHAT WE'VE HEARD IS

03:10:35.791 --> 03:10:36.892
OUR WITNESS TESTIFIED FROM THE

03:10:36.958 --> 03:10:37.859
INDUSTRY IS THAT THE

03:10:37.926 --> 03:10:38.960
OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF

03:10:39.027 --> 03:10:40.996
PEOPLE. DON'T WANT TO LITIGATE

03:10:41.062 --> 03:10:41.930
BECAUSEIT'S GOING TO TAKE TWO

03:10:41.997 --> 03:10:43.031
OR THREE YEARS OR PICKING A

03:10:43.098 --> 03:10:44.366
JUDGE OUT OF THE HOT SUPERIOR

03:10:44.432 --> 03:10:45.400
COURT WHO MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE

03:10:45.467 --> 03:10:46.168
ANY IDEA WHAT THE HOUSING

03:10:46.234 --> 03:10:47.669
ACCOUNTABILITY ACT SAYS IT'S

03:10:47.736 --> 03:10:49.271
GOING TO BE VERY EXPENSIVE.

03:10:49.337 --> 03:10:50.272
YOU'RE LIKELY TO GET INTO

03:10:50.338 --> 03:10:51.673
KALYTERA COLLATERAL ISSUES OF

03:10:51.740 --> 03:10:53.542
THE SCOPE OF DISCOVERY AND SO

03:10:53.608 --> 03:10:54.609
IT'S ACTUALLY JUST DISCOURAGING

03:10:54.676 --> 03:10:56.111
PEOPLE FROM FROM DEVELOPING IN

03:10:56.178 --> 03:10:58.046
THE FIRST PLACE SO WE FEEL LIKE

03:10:58.113 --> 03:10:59.347
THERE'S A STRONG RATIONALE FOR

03:10:59.414 --> 03:11:00.649
THE BILL BASED ON WHAT WE'VE

03:11:00.715 --> 03:11:01.183
HEARD FROM PEOPLE ON THE

03:11:01.249 --> 03:11:05.320
GROUND. OKAY AND- ONE OF THE

03:11:05.387 --> 03:11:06.588
THINGS AND I AND I THINK WE'VE

03:11:06.655 --> 03:11:09.090
TALKED ABOUT THIS. BUT THE FACT

03:11:09.157 --> 03:11:10.725
THAT ONLY THE DEVELOPER CAN

03:11:10.792 --> 03:11:12.961
APPEAL THE DECISION. MAKES

03:11:13.028 --> 03:11:15.363
THIS. GIVES THE APPEARANCE THE

03:11:15.430 --> 03:11:17.799
DEVELOPER HAS THE POWER. AND I

03:11:17.866 --> 03:11:20.302
DON'T THINK- A CITY WOULD SAY

03:11:20.368 --> 03:11:22.404
AREN'T OUR DECISION WAS WRONG

03:11:22.470 --> 03:11:23.371
BUT IF THEY GET A THREAT OF

03:11:23.438 --> 03:11:24.339
LITIGATION THIS MIGHT BE A

03:11:24.406 --> 03:11:25.473
GREAT WAY TO MEDIATE SO I'D

03:11:25.540 --> 03:11:26.408
LIKE TO ASK YOU TO LOOK AT THAT

03:11:26.474 --> 03:11:28.410
EXPLORE PERHAPS. AS THIS BILL

03:11:28.476 --> 03:11:30.545
MOVES FORWARD- COULD THERE BE

03:11:30.612 --> 03:11:31.847
SOMETHING WHERE IT'S FAIR AND

03:11:31.913 --> 03:11:33.114
I'M MORE FOCUSED ON MEDIATION

03:11:33.181 --> 03:11:34.549
BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S WHERE

03:11:34.616 --> 03:11:38.119
THE REAL VALUE IN THIS BILL.

03:11:38.186 --> 03:11:39.654
COMES FROM- AND- COULD YOU WALK

03:11:39.721 --> 03:11:41.223
US THROUGH BECAUSE I THINK. I

03:11:41.289 --> 03:11:42.490
DON'T NECESSARILY UNDERSTAND

03:11:42.557 --> 03:11:44.059
PERFECTLY. HOW DOES THIS

03:11:44.125 --> 03:11:46.695
APPEALS BOARD WORK. RELATED TO

03:11:46.761 --> 03:11:48.196
THE CITY'S OWN DECISION MAKING

03:11:48.263 --> 03:11:50.632
PROCESS. THE COASTAL COMMISSION

03:11:50.699 --> 03:11:52.467
BECAUSE MOST OF THEM A LARGE

03:11:52.534 --> 03:11:53.034
PART OF MY DISTRICT HAS THE

03:11:53.101 --> 03:11:54.636
COASTAL COMMISSION. AND THEN

03:11:54.703 --> 03:11:55.770
HOW DOES IT WORK IN CIVIL

03:11:55.837 --> 03:11:56.771
COURTS IF YOU CAN LOOK AT THAT

03:11:56.838 --> 03:11:58.340
INTERSECTION. AND KIND OF WALK

03:11:58.406 --> 03:11:59.541
US THROUGH IT AND I THINK THAT

03:11:59.608 --> 03:12:00.475
WOULD BE HELPFUL. FOR SOME

03:12:00.542 --> 03:12:01.643
FOLKS IN THE OPPOSITION AS WELL

03:12:01.710 --> 03:12:03.879
HERE YEAH ABSOLUTELY AND I AND

03:12:03.945 --> 03:12:05.847
I WILL SAY. I SHOULD SAY THIS

03:12:05.914 --> 03:12:07.048
FIRST OFF JUST TO WE WILL

03:12:07.115 --> 03:12:07.782
ACTUALLY BE ACCEPTING

03:12:07.849 --> 03:12:08.683
COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS AND I

03:12:08.750 --> 03:12:09.751
THINK THEY'RE VERY HELPFUL I

03:12:09.818 --> 03:12:11.052
WANT TO THANK. THE CHAIR AND

03:12:11.119 --> 03:12:12.320
HER STAFF FOR THOSE AMENDMENTS

03:12:12.387 --> 03:12:14.589
AND- AS I READ IT IT ADDRESSES-

03:12:14.656 --> 03:12:15.924
ALL OF THE CONCERNS RAISED BY

03:12:15.991 --> 03:12:19.694
THE LEAGUE EXCEPT FOR ONE-

03:12:19.761 --> 03:12:20.195
WHERE I THINK WE HAVE A

03:12:20.262 --> 03:12:21.096
RESPECTFUL DISAGREEMENT. V. THE

03:12:21.162 --> 03:12:23.298
WAY THAT THIS WOULD WORK- SORT

03:12:23.365 --> 03:12:25.967
OF IN IN THEORY IS- ADD A

03:12:26.034 --> 03:12:27.135
DEVELOPER WOULD COME FORWARD

03:12:27.202 --> 03:12:29.104
SUBMIT. A PROPOSAL TO BUILD

03:12:29.170 --> 03:12:30.705
SOME AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THAT

03:12:30.772 --> 03:12:31.973
WOULD BE FULLY COMPLIANT WITH

03:12:32.040 --> 03:12:34.142
THE ZONING. THAT WAS DECIDED BY

03:12:34.209 --> 03:12:35.310
THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT THEY SAID

03:12:35.377 --> 03:12:36.444
THIS IS THIS IS MERRY IN THE

03:12:36.511 --> 03:12:37.279
CITY WHERE YOU CAN BUILD THIS

03:12:37.345 --> 03:12:38.513
TYPE OF HOUSING. YOU KNOW

03:12:38.580 --> 03:12:39.481
THERE'S AN ARBITRARY AND

03:12:39.547 --> 03:12:40.749
UNLAWFUL DENIAL THE CITY

03:12:40.815 --> 03:12:41.683
DOESN'T MAKE THE REQUIRED

03:12:41.750 --> 03:12:44.019
FINDINGS AS AS REQUIRED UNDER

03:12:44.085 --> 03:12:45.387
THE HOUSING COMPANY ACT. THE

03:12:45.453 --> 03:12:46.755
DEVELOPER COULD THEN DECIDE

03:12:46.821 --> 03:12:48.023
THAT THEY WANTED TO APPEAL THAT

03:12:48.089 --> 03:12:49.591
DECISION TO THIS SPECIALIZED

03:12:49.658 --> 03:12:51.293
REVIEW BOARD. THEY WOULD HAVE

03:12:51.359 --> 03:12:52.694
THE BURDEN BY A PREPONDERANCE

03:12:52.761 --> 03:12:54.529
OF EVIDENCE TO DEMONSTRATE. ON

03:12:54.596 --> 03:12:56.464
THAT VERY VERY NARROW ISSUE

03:12:56.531 --> 03:12:57.632
THIS THIS IS NOT MEANT TO GET

03:12:57.699 --> 03:12:58.533
INTO A LOT OF DIFFERENT KINDS

03:12:58.600 --> 03:13:00.201
ISSUES IN A VERY NARROW ISSUE.

03:13:00.268 --> 03:13:01.503
WITH PEOPLE WITH SPECIALIZED

03:13:01.569 --> 03:13:02.971
EXPERTISE THE CITY DID NOT MAKE

03:13:03.038 --> 03:13:04.940
THE REQUIRED FINDINGS. IF THEY

03:13:05.006 --> 03:13:06.541
COULD DEMONSTRATE THAT. THE

03:13:06.608 --> 03:13:07.442
CITY WOULD THEN HAVE THE

03:13:07.509 --> 03:13:09.978
OPPORTUNITY TO REBUT THAT TO

03:13:10.045 --> 03:13:10.612
SHOW WHY DID THAT THEY DID IN

03:13:10.679 --> 03:13:12.781
FACT HAVE. THE APPROPRIATE

03:13:12.847 --> 03:13:13.982
FINDINGS TO MAKE THAT DECISION

03:13:14.049 --> 03:13:16.084
TO DENY IT- AND THEN IT WOULD

03:13:16.151 --> 03:13:18.219
BE UP TO THIS- THIS PANEL TO

03:13:18.286 --> 03:13:20.088
MAKE A DETERMINATION. WHAT WE

03:13:20.155 --> 03:13:22.123
FOUND FROM FROM- FROM

03:13:22.190 --> 03:13:23.224
MASSACHUSETTS AND OTHER STATES

03:13:23.291 --> 03:13:24.526
IS THAT THE DECISIONS TEND TO

03:13:24.592 --> 03:13:25.694
BE NEXT IT IS NOT MEANT TO BE

03:13:25.760 --> 03:13:27.262
A- A BODY THAT COMES DOWN ON

03:13:27.329 --> 03:13:28.096
ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER AND

03:13:28.163 --> 03:13:28.730
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE

03:13:28.797 --> 03:13:29.998
REPRESENTATIVES BOTH FROM LOCAL

03:13:30.065 --> 03:13:31.633
GOVERNMENT FROM JURISDICTIONS

03:13:31.700 --> 03:13:32.367
LARGER JURISDICTIONS SMALLER

03:13:32.434 --> 03:13:35.337
JURISDICTIONS. AND FROM FOLKS

03:13:35.403 --> 03:13:36.237
WITH SPECIALIZED EXPERTISE. I

03:13:36.304 --> 03:13:38.506
DELETE TO YOUR POINT- THE

03:13:38.573 --> 03:13:39.307
PARTIES WOULD ACTUALLY SETTLE

03:13:39.374 --> 03:13:40.608
BEFORE THAT HAPPENED- AND

03:13:40.675 --> 03:13:41.676
THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

03:13:41.743 --> 03:13:43.011
ATTRACTED TO ME ABOUT THIS BILL

03:13:43.078 --> 03:13:44.412
IS. I THINK IT WAS AND I DON'T

03:13:44.479 --> 03:13:45.647
KNOW MAYBE MISS REMEMBER

03:13:45.714 --> 03:13:48.049
EXACTLY WHAT I THINK WAS 71% OF

03:13:48.116 --> 03:13:48.750
THE APPEALS ACTUALLY SETTLED

03:13:48.817 --> 03:13:50.819
BEFORE THEY WERE HURT- SO THIS

03:13:50.885 --> 03:13:52.020
ACTUALLY INDUCED TO THE PARTIES

03:13:52.087 --> 03:13:53.421
TO COME TO SOME AGREEMENT. TO

03:13:53.488 --> 03:13:55.290
NEGOTIATE A COMPROMISE AVOIDING

03:13:55.357 --> 03:13:57.492
THE EXPENSE AND DELAY. AND

03:13:57.559 --> 03:13:59.627
CONTROVERSY OF LITIGATION. IF

03:13:59.694 --> 03:14:00.996
YOU DID HAVE A DECISION FROM AN

03:14:01.062 --> 03:14:01.997
APPEAL PANEL THAT EITHER PARTY

03:14:02.063 --> 03:14:03.631
DON'T LIKE. EITHER PARTY COULD

03:14:03.698 --> 03:14:06.801
THEN. APPEAL THAT DECISION TO-

03:14:06.868 --> 03:14:08.503
TO IT TOO TO THE SUPERIOR COURT

03:14:08.570 --> 03:14:09.671
SO IT DOESN'T TAKE AWAY

03:14:09.738 --> 03:14:10.972
ANYBODY'S OPPORTUNITY TO AT THE

03:14:11.039 --> 03:14:13.208
END OF THE DAY. SEEK A JUDICIAL

03:14:13.274 --> 03:14:14.809
DETERMINATION IN COURT BUT WHAT

03:14:14.876 --> 03:14:16.778
IT WHAT WE HOPE IT WILL DO. IS

03:14:16.845 --> 03:14:18.313
PROVIDE AN INCENTIVE FOR PEOPLE

03:14:18.380 --> 03:14:20.115
TO NEGOTIATE COMPROMISE AND GET

03:14:20.181 --> 03:14:21.649
THINGS DONE ON THE FRONT DESK.

03:14:21.716 --> 03:14:23.585
AND THAT ABILITY TO COMPROMISE

03:14:23.651 --> 03:14:24.819
ONE OF THE REASONS I LIKE TO

03:14:24.886 --> 03:14:25.720
CONTINUE WORKING ON THIS

03:14:25.787 --> 03:14:27.288
BECAUSE I THINK. YOU'RE ON TO

03:14:27.355 --> 03:14:29.724
SOMETHING HERE- BUT I YOU KNOW

03:14:29.791 --> 03:14:30.792
I THINK THAT ABILITY TO

03:14:30.859 --> 03:14:32.227
COMPROMISE AND MEDIATE IS WHERE

03:14:32.293 --> 03:14:34.195
