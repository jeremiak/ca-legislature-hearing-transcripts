MAKE IT EASIER FOR SURVIVORS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING- TRAFFICKING TO CLEAR THEIR RECORDS VIA VACATE YOUR RELIEF. CURRENT LAW CREATES A CATCH TWENTY TWO THAT MAKES IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE FOR SURVIVORS TO CLEAR THEIR CRIMINAL RECORDS. SURVIVORS OFTEN HAVE TO PAY ALL FINES MEET ALL PROBATION REQUIREMENTS BEFORE THEY CAN EVEN ASK A COURT TO CLEAR THEIR CRIMINAL RECORD OF NON VIOLENT OFFENSES. WITHOUT A CLEAR RECORD EMPLOYMENT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE WITHOUT EMPLOYMENT PAYING A FEE TO THE COURT AS A BARRIER. THAT PREVENTS MANY SURVIVORS FROM EVEN TRYING TO CLEAR THEIR RECORDS. THIS BILL WOULD PREVENT A COURT FROM REFUSING TO HEAR A HUMAN TRAFFICKING SURVIVORS PETITION. FOR RAP RECORD CLEARANCE DUE TO UNPAID FINES OR FEES. IT ALSO WOULD GIVE SURVIVORS THE ABILITY TO PITCH IT TO PETITION PROVOCATEUR RELIEF AT ANYTIME AFTER THEY ARE REMOVED. FROM TRAFFICKING. AT THIS BILL HAS RECEIVED AS ZERO NO VOTES IT WILL MAKE A WORLD OF DIFFERENCE TO SURVIVORS AND HUMAN. TRAFFICKING VICTIMS. THAT WERE TRYING. TO PIECE THEIR LIVES BACK TOGETHER THIS BILL HELPS INTO.

MR MEDINA YOU MAY OPEN THANK YOU MR SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT AB THREE EIGHTY EIGHT WHICH IS A MEASURE THAT WILL ENSURE NOT ADMINISTRATIVE EDUCATION EMPLOYEES. SERVING IN POSITIONS REQUIRING CERTIFICATION WILL BECOME PERMANENT EMPLOYEES FOLLOWING A PROBATIONARY PERIOD. TODAY EXPERIENCED EDUCATORS AND SMALL SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE BEING DISMISSED AND TERMINATED FOR ARBITRARY REASONS WITHOUT WARNING. UNDER CURRENT LAW ONLY CERTIFICATED EMPLOYEES IN TEACHING POSITIONS AT COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION WITH THE AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE OF MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY PUPILS CAN ACHIEVE PERMANENT STATUS AFTER PROBATIONARY PERIOD. THIS MEANS THAT CERTIFICATED CERTIFICATED EMPLOYEES IN NON TEACHING POSITIONS DO NOT HAVE A RIGHT TO ATTAIN PERMANENT STATUS. THIS POLICY AFFECTS GROUPS OF CERTIFICATED EMPLOYEES SUCH AS SCHOOL NURSES ENGLISH LANGUAGE EDUCATOR FOSTER YOUTH COUNSELORS AND SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHERS WORKING WITH SEVERELY DISABLED STUDENTS AMONG OTHERS. IN THE CASE OF A DISMISSAL A PERMANENT EMPLOYEE STATUS WOULD ALLOW EMPLOYEES TO REQUEST A HEARING BEFORE COMMISSION ON PROFESSIONAL COMPETENCE TO DECIDE WHETHER TO THEIR DISMISSAL WAS APPROPRIATE. FURTHER A PERMANENT EMPLOYEE HAS A RIGHT TO REQUEST A HEARING DURING A REDUCTION IN FORCE. UNFORTUNATELY SEVERAL CLASSES OF EMPLOYEES HAVE BEEN INAPPROPRIATELY DENIED PERMANENT STATUS BASED ON THE NEEDS TO CREATE FISCAL SOLVENCY OR INTENT ANTICIPATION THAT THE NEEDS FOR SERVICES IN THE FUTURE ARE IN SECURE. THE LACK OF PERMANENT STATUS IS LEAD TO DISCRIMINATION RETALIATION AND FAVORITISM WITHIN OUR SMALLER SCHOOL DISTRICTS THIS BILL WILL REMEDY THIS SITUATION TREATING ALL CERTIFICATED EDUCATION EMPLOYEES WITH DIGNITY RESPECT AND THE PROFESSIONALISM THEY DESERVE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISS REGINA. SEEING NO DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THE ITEM. TOOK OVER THE ROLE. DESERVE IT. ALL MEMBERS VOTERS OUT OF A. ALL MEMBERS OF. DESERVE A.

I THINK THIS IS SPEAKER MEMBERS I RISE TODAY TO PRESENT AB THREE NINETY SEVEN. EVERY MEMBER OF THIS BODY HAS BEEN INUNDATED WITH EDT ISSUES THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN RESOLVED BY THE AGENCY. UNDER CURRENT LAW AN APPLICANT CAN HAVE THEIR BENEFITS TERMINATED IF THEY SUBMIT AN INACCURATE STATEMENT HOWEVER MANY STATEMENTS EDIE FLAGS ARE NOT INTENTIONALLY INACCURATE BUT INSTEAD MISSTATEMENTS DUE TO CONFUSING FORMS THE OUTCOME FOR MANY CALIFORNIANS IS BEING LOCKED OUT OF BENEFITS FOR FIVE AS MUCH AS TWENTY THREE WEEKS. THIS IS AN UNACCEPTABLE OUTCOME AND SO MANY CALIFORNIANS ARE RELYING ON THIS IMPORTANT ECONOMIC LIFELINE AB THREE NINETY SEVEN REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT JUSTIN CLEAR NOTICE THE CLAIMANTS IF EDIE HAS IDENTIFIED THIS ISSUE WITH OUR APPLICATION AND ALLOW OUR RIGHT TO CURE. THIS LEGISLATION DOES NOT CHANGE THE AGENCY'S ABILITY TO INVESTIGATE AND PROSECUTE FRAUD INSTEAD WE ARE FOCUSED ON CLARIFYING AND SIMPLIFYING THE MAZE OF FORMS INDIVIDUALS MUST NAVIGATE TO KEEP BENEFITS I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER MAYES MISSED ONE. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I ISE IN SUPPORT OF AB THREE NINE SEVEN. I JUST WANT TO THANK THE AUTHORS FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS BILL WHICH IS EXTREMELY NECESSARY. AS WE ALL KNOW EDT HAS BEEN AN ABSOLUTE NIGHTMARE AND THE PROBLEM THIS BILL SEEKS TO ADDRESS IS A LARGE REASON WHY. MY DISTRICT OFFICE LIKE MANY OF YOURS HAVE RECEIVED THOUSANDS OF DISTRESSED BECAUSE CONSTITUENTS. HAVE OF WHO'VE CONTACTED US. WHO ARE JUST LOOKING FOR AN ANSWER ON THE UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS IN MANY OF THESE CASES THE EDIE DIDN'T EVEN GIVEN THE COURTESY OF A STATUS UPDATE ON THE BENEFITS AND THEY ARE LEFT WONDERING WHAT TO DO MOVING FORWARD HOW TO FEED THEIR FAMILIES DURING THESE DIFFICULT TIMES. TOO OFTEN PEOPLE ARE JUST TRYING TO NAVIGATE COMPLEX STATE AGENCY JUST AS JUST SUCH AS ADD. WILL BE CONFUSE IN THE APPLICATION PROCESS AND MAKE TECHNICAL ERRORS OR NOT SUBMIT EVERY SINGLE PIECE OF APPROPRIATE DOCUMENTATION. THE EDG WITH THIS CALL THE APPLICANT THE APPLICATION BUT NEVER INFORMED OF A DISQUALIFICATION OR GIVEN OR GIVE THEM A CHANCE TO CORRECT THE MISTAKE. THIS IS AN ABSOLUTELY AND NECESSARY AND UNACCEPTABLE AND I'M HAPPY TO SEE THE CHANGES THIS BILL WOULD MAKE TO THE PROCESS FOR FAMILIES WHO NEED THIS THE MOST.

AS NOTED IN THE ANALYSIS SINCE NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT ONLY SEVEN NEW POLITICAL PARTIES OF QUALIFIED TO PARTICIPATE IN CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS WITH SIX PARTIES QUALIFYING THROUGH VOTER REGISTRATION. AND ONLY ONE QUALIFYING TO PETITION PROCESS BUT THEY FAILED THE STATE QUALIFIED FOR SUBSEQUENT ELECTIONS WHEN THEY FAILED TO REGISTER ENOUGH VOTERS THIS BILL WOULD REDUCE THE NUMBER OF SIGNATURES NEEDED ON A PETITION TO FORM A NEW POLITICAL PARTY. FROM 10% 23% PUTTING CALIFORNIAN LINE WITH THE VAST MAJORITY OF OTHER STATES DURING COMMITTEE RESEARCHING THIS ISSUE FOUND THAT MOST STATES ARE BETWEEN TWO AND FIVE PERCENT. THIS BILL ALSO SEEKS TO FREE UP NAMES OF PRIOR UNSUCCESSFUL POLITICAL MOVEMENTS BY ALLOWING A NEW POLITICAL BODY TO REGISTER WITH THE NAME THAT HAS BEEN ABANDONED LASTLY THIS BILL FORMALIZES THE SECRETARY OF STATE APPEALS PROCESS. WHEN APPLYING FOR A PARTY NAME I THINK THE ELECTIONS COMMITTEE AND THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE FOR WORKING CLOSELY WITH ME ON THIS BILL INCLUDING NEW MINUTES TAKEN JUST LAST WEEK. RESPECTFULLY ASK AND I VOTE. THANK YOU MISS REYES MISTER. YOU ARE. A QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR.

TO WEIGH IN AFTER A DECADE OF EXPERIENCE AS TO WHETHER WE WANT. TO CONTINUE WITH THE SYSTEM MOVING FORWARD. THANK YOU MISS KELLY SEEING NO OTHER MEMBERS SEEKING RECOGNITION ON THE BILL MR MAYES YOU MAY CLOSE.

KERKORIAN ASSEMBLY BILL FIVE SO BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER GABRIEL IN OTHERS ARE THAT RELATING TO MEDIA. MR GAVE YOU MAIL THANK YOU MISTER. THIS BILL TO DO WITH THE S. OF HOW SOCIAL COM Mà R. PA THIS. AND FOR MANY PARTICULARLY FOLLOWING THE ASSAULT ON OUR DEMOCRACY THE CAPITAL EARLY THIS YEAR THESE CONCERNS HAVE CENTERED AROUND THE ROLE THAT SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS PLAY IN PROMOTING HATE SPEECH DISINFORMATION CONSPIRACY THEORIES VIOLENT EXTREMISM AND SEVERE POLITICAL POLARIZATION. THERE'S ALSO CONCERNS ACROSS THE SPECTRUM ABOUT WHICH VOICES ARE BEING AMPLIFIED ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND WHICH OTHERS ARE BEING SILENCED THIS BILL TAKES A VERY MODEST APPROACH TO THAT ISSUE BY REQUIRING TRANSPARENCY FROM MAJOR SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS. ABOUT WHAT THEIR CONTENT MODERATION POLICIES ARE ASKING THEM TO BE TRANSPARENT WITH THEIR CONSUMERS AND WITH THE PUBLIC ABOUT HOW THEY ARE MODERATING OUR POLITICAL DISCOURSE. THIS IS A NARROW APPROACH THAT RESPECTS THE FIRST AMENDMENT AND FEDERAL PREEMPTION AND PROVIDES MEANINGFUL TRANSPARENCY AND PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY. WE ARE A THE CONCERNS RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION CONTINUE TO BE A CONVERSATIONS WITH THEM BUT THIS IS AN IMPORTANT FIRST STEP ON ADDRESSING THIS VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE. THAT IS CENTRAL TO OUR DEMOCRACY AND WITHOUT WOULD RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE ON EIGHTY FIVE EIGHTY SEVEN. THANK YOU RISK A REAL MISTER CUNNINGHAM YOUR- THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE AS A CO AUTHOR OF THIS MEASURE. AND IF YOU'RE ON THE FENCE ON THIS BILL I ASK YOU TO CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING. INFORMATION WHEN YOU MAKE YOUR DECISION. FIRST OF ALL A HANDFUL OF COMPANIES THAT WE DON'T NEED TO NAME THEM. EXERTS AN INCREDIBLE UNDENIABLE INFLENCE OVER OUR SOCIETY. ALL ASPECTS OF SOCIETY OUR ELECTIONS THE NEWS FEED PEOPLE READ. GO ON DOWN THE LIST AND THIS IS WELL DOCUMENTED AND IT'S UNDENIABLE. AND THEY EXERCISE IT'S NOT CENSORSHIP BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT THE GOVERNMENT. BUT ITS CONTENTS SUPPRESSION FOR LACK OF BETTER TERM. IN A TOTAL BLACK BOX THEY OPERATE WITH TOTAL IMPUNITY ON WHAT THEY CHOOSE TO TAKE DOWN OUT OF THE FEED WHAT THEY CHOOSE TO ALLOW WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING WE DON'T KNOW THE STANDARD THEY'RE APPLYING WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER THAT'S BEING FAIRLY APPLIED TO ALL DIFFERENT TYPES OF YOU POINTS. IT GETS APPEALED TO AN INDEPENDENT BOARD IN A CERTAIN WITH A CERTAIN PARTICULAR COMPANY AGAIN I DON'T NEED TO NAME THAT INDEPENDENT BOARD WE DON'T KNOW WHO'S ON IT. WE KNOW VIRTUALLY NOTHING ABOUT THIS AND IT IMPACTS AGAIN EVERY SINGLE FACET OF OUR SOCIETY IN THE MODERN WORLD. WHERE ELSE ARE WE ALLOWING THAT TO GO ON. IF THE COMPANY'S POISONING WATER. WE HOLD THEM TO ACCOUNT WE MAKE THEM DISCLOSE WHAT THEY'RE DOING TO KEEP THE WATER PIER. OKAY SO ALL THIS BILL IS ASKING YOU TO DO IS TO CONSIDER. IMPLEMENTING A REPORTING REQUIREMENT IT DOESN'T TELL THE COMPANIES WHAT TO DO OR NOT DO IT DOESN'T RESTRICT THEIR FREEDOM TO OPERATE. IT DOESN'T CONTROL WHO THEY ALLOW ON THEIR PLATFORM IT JUST SAYS HEY. ONCE A QUARTER SO YOU GOTTA TELL US WHAT CONTENT YOU'RE SUPPRESSING WHAT STANDARD YOU'RE APPLYING TO DO IT AND ARE YOU DOING IT FAIRLY AND THEN WE CAN ALL FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO ABOUT THAT. I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT FIRST STEP. I DON'T THINK IT'LL BE THE LAST STEP BUT I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT FIRST STEP I APPLAUD THE AUTHOR HE IS COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH INDUSTRY TO WORK OUT ISSUES. AND I THINK WE WOULD BE DOING OUR SOCIETY IN PARTICULAR ARE MOST VULNERABLE MEMBERS ARE KIDS WHOSE BRAINS ARE BEING SHAPED BY THE INFLUENCE OF THE CONTENT ON THESE PLATFORMS. WITHOUT YOUR KNOWLEDGE. TRY TO CONTROL YOUR TEENS ARE LOOKING AT ON THEIR PHONES GOOD LUCK TO YOU I'VE BEEN TRYING TO DO IT FOR FOUR YEARS FAILING MISERABLY. WE NEED TO STEP IN WE NEED TRANSPARENCY WE NEED A LITTLE MORE ACCOUNTABILITY AND WE NEED THIS BILL. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN IDOL. THANK CUNNINGHAM GALLAGHER YOUR RECOMMENDS. THEY YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS- I TO WRITE IN THE- OF AB FIVE EIGHTY SEVEN- AND AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN LUIS OBISPO SAID. I THINK THIS IS A GOOD FIRST STEP WE NEED TRANSPARENCY. WE NEED TO BEGIN WITH SOME TRANSPARENCY ON HOW THESE DECISIONS ARE GETTING MADE. ABOUT WHAT CONTENT IS BEING MODERATED WHAT WHAT- VIEWS ARE BEING CENSORED. AND I WILL BRING UP TO EXAMPLES THAT I THINK. REALLY BRING HOME THE POINT OF WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT. WE FOUND OUT HERE RECENTLY. WE'RE TOLD ALL THE TIME THIS IS A PRIVATE COMPANY THEY CAN MAKE THEIR OWN DECISIONS FIRST AMENDMENT DOES NOT APPLY TO PRIVATE COMPANIES BUT WE FOUND OUT HERE RECENTLY THAT THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. WAS CONTACTING TWITTER AND FACEBOOK AND TELLING THEM HEY TAKE THESE POSTS DOWN SO WE NOW HAVE A STATE ACTOR. TELLING THESE PRIVATE COMPANIES HEY WE THINK THIS IS MISINFORMATION TAKE IT OFF TAKE IT DOWN. AND WE STILL HAVEN'T GOTTEN FULL TRANSPARENCY ON WHAT THOSE POSTS WERE. BUT WORKING IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE STATE FACEBOOK AND TWITTER WERE CENSORING SPEECH ON ON FACEBOOK. SO THERE YOU GO ARE WE GONNA GO DOWN THIS ROAD WHERE STATE ACTORS ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO INFLUENCE AND DETERMINE WHAT WHAT SHOWS UP. ON THESE PLATFORMS. SECONDLY. YOU MAY REMEMBER THIS A YEAR AGO THERE WAS THERE WAS TALK THAT. THE ORIGINS OF THIS VIRUS THAT HAS PLAGUED OUR ENTIRE PLANET. MAY HAVE COME FROM A LEAK OUT OF A- LAB IN WUHAN CHANT IN WUHAN CHINA. FACEBOOK AND THE PEOPLE THE TRUTH EXPERTS. AT FACEBOOKU NOBODY REALLY KNOWS THERE IS NO REAL TRANSPARENCY ABOUT WHO THESE PEOPLE ARE THAT MAKE THESE DECISIONS DECIDED NO THAT'S FAKE NEWS THAT'S MISINFORMATION. AND SUPPRESSED EVEN THE MENTION OF SAYING THAT THAT COULD BE THE CASE AS MISINFORMATION WELL WE ALL KNOW. IN THE LAST COUPLE WEEKS THAT ACTUALLY THERE IS THERE IS SOME EVIDENCE TO VERY MUCH SOME STRONG EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THAT IN THEIR HOT THERE IS INVESTIGATIONS INTO THAT VERY ISSUE. WITH PRESIDENT BIDEN. TASKING. HIS SECURITY FORCES TO LOOK INTO THIS ISSUE AND TO PRESS THAT ISSUE WITH COMMUNIST CHINA. BUT DON'T WORRY BECAUSE FACEBOOK AND TWITTER DECIDED LONG BEFORE THERE WAS EVER ANY INVESTIGATION BEFORE ANYBODY COULD ACTUALLY GET TO WHAT THE FACTS WERE THAT THIS WAS MISINFORMATION. DO WE REALLY WANT TO ALLOW THAT TO REMAIN THE STATUS QUO. THIS SELECT GROUP OF PEOPLE GET TO DETERMINE WHAT'S TRUE AND WHAT'S NOT WHAT'S MISINFORMATION AND WHAT'S NOT. THIS IS THE FIRST STEP AND I WON'T. HAVE BEEN VERY. OUTSPOKEN ABOUT WHERE I WANT TO GO WITH THIS ULTIMATELY I THINK THE FIRST AMENDMENT SHOULD APPLY. TO THESE COMPANIES BECAUSE THEY ARE THE NEW PUBLIC FORM. AND HE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS THESE THE STRONGEST SPEECH PROTECTIONS IN ITS CONSTITUTION IN THE NATION. IT SAYS YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO FREELY SPEAK PUBLISH. IN OUR CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION HAS ALREADY BEEN INTERPRETED AS BEING APPLYING TO PRIVATE PROPERTY A SHOPPING MALL. IN THE BRUGNON CASE AND THE REASON BEHIND THAT WAS THAT SHOPPING MALLS. YOUR THROUGH THE EIGHTIES AND AS OF THE GROWTH OF THESE SHOPPING MALLS HAVE BECOME THE NEW PUBLIC SQUARE THERE WAS NO LONGER THE TOWN SQUARE THE TRADITIONAL TOWNS WHERE WOULD PEOPLE WOULD COME IN PRESENT THEIR IDEAS AND DEBATE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN DISPLACED NOW BY THE SHOPPING MALL WELL NOW THE SHOPPING MALL WE KNOW. BY HOW MANY HAVE BEEN CLOSED DOWN. THESE LAST DECADES HAS BEEN DISPLACED BY THE DIGITAL AGE AND SOCIAL MEDIA AND WE ALL KNOW IT. THE NEW PUBLIC SQUARE. IS FACEBOOK AND TWITTER ANY SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS WHERE MUCH OF OUR PUBLIC DISCOURSE OUR POLITICAL DISCOURSE ARGUABLY ELECTIONS HINGE ON THE INFORMATION. THAT COMES THROUGH THESE IN THAT SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS CAN WE TRULY SAY. WE CONTINUE WITH THE STATUS QUO THAT KNOW THEIR PRIVATE ACTORS THEY CAN DO WHATEVER THEY WANT. AND THEY CAN DETERMINE WHAT SPEECH IS TRUE AND WHAT IS FALSE THIRTY SECONDS WITHOUT ANY TRANSPARENCY WITHOUT ANY INPUT.

AB ELEVEN THIRTY NINE CORKERY SOME AGO A LEVIN THIRTY NINE BY LORENA GONZALEZ AND OTHERS AN ACCOLADE TO ENERGY. MR THE YOU MAILED ME. THANK YOU MISTER. I'LL BE HONEST HI THIS IS PROBABLY THE TOUGHEST BILL I'VE HAD TO NAVIGATE AND IN THAT SAME SOMETHING COMPARED TO SOME OF THE BILLS THAT I'VE HAD TO NAVIGATE BECAUSE THE LEVEL OF MISINFORMATION THAT HAS BEEN OUT THERE IS ASTONISHING. WHEN I FIRST SAW ELEVEN THIRTY NINE I SAID WHAT WHY WHY. AM I GONNA GET IN THE MIDDLE OF SOMETHING. THAT THE P. YOU SEE SHOULD BE DOING. BUT I'D ALREADY KNOWN FROM PREVIOUS BILLS THAT THE CPUC DOESN'T ALWAYS DO WHAT THEY SHOULD BE DOING. AS QUICKLY AS THEY SHOULD BE DOING THAT. AND IT'S UNFORTUNATE. THAT ONE OF THE FIRST BILLS I EVER VOTED ON IN THIS ASSEMBLY WAS TO TELL THE C. P. U. C. TO STOP THE CAUTION. THAT IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW. UNDER OUR NET METERING. AND YET HERE WE ARE EIGHT YEARS LATER ST WE STILL NEED TO STOP THIS COLLECTION. DESPITE WHAT SOME FOLKS SAY THERE IS A COST SHIFT EVERY SINGLE REPORT THAT HAS BEEN MADE ABOUT HOW WE DO NET ENERGY METERING. SAYS IT THE CPUC SAYS THAT SMUD SAYS IT UC BERKELEY SAYS IT THERE IS A COST SHIFT OF THREE BILLION DOLLARS AND THAT MEANS THE PEOPLE LIKE ME WHO HAVE ROOFTOP SOLAR ARE BEING SUBSIDIZED BY MY WORKING CLASS NEIGHBORS. WHO WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO AFFORD. SOLAR IN SAN DIEGO. THAT THAT THAT IS TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY DOLLARS A YEAR. THAT IS BEING PAID BY FOLKS WHO SOME DON'T WANT SOLAR SHARE SOME WHO ARE RENTERS WHO HAVE NO CONTROL OVER WHETHER THE HOPS UP SOLAR SOME WHO HAVE BAD ROOFS AND CAN'T GET SOLAR. IN SOME WHO JUST MIGHT HAVE A HOUSE THAT FACES WRONG WAY INSULAR WOULDN'T WORK FOR THEM. IN A COURSE THOSE WHO WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO AFFORD IT. SO INSTEAD WE SAY EVERY TIME SOMEBODY GOES AND GET OLDER UNDER THEIR HOUSE. IT PUTS ADDITIONAL COST ON THOSE FOLKS WHO DON'T HAVE SOLAR. THIS STARTED IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES AND IT WAS WRONG AND SOMETIMES WE HAVE TO STAND UP AND SAY THE WAY WE DECIDED TO FUND IN INCENTIVIZE SOLAR WHEN WE DESPERATELY NEEDED MORE WAS WRONG. AND SO IT'S BEEN SO POPULAR AND SO SUCCESSFUL THAT WE HAVE TO KEEP REVISITING AND SAYING HEY C. P. U. C. WE CAN'T CONTINUE TO DO THIS. SHOULD WE- INCENTIVIZE ROOFTOP SOLAR PROBABLY YES I WOULD SAY YES AND WE SHOULD DO IT. THROUGH THE STATE BUDGET IN A FAIR WAY WE SHOULD NOT DO IT ON THE BACKS OF RATE PAYERS. I WOULD LOVE FOR THE P. YOU SEE TO ACT OR TO FEEL LIKE THEY'RE GOING TO ACT AS THEY KEEP TELLING US THEY WILL. BUT WE KEEP WAITING AND IF WE LOOK AT PAST HISTORY OF THE C. P. U. C. WE'LL SEE THEY TEND TO DO THIS. IF ANYBODY REMEMBERS LIFELINE. HOW MANY YEARS DID WE WAIT FOR THE CPUC. ACT ON LIFELINE. AND YET EVERY SINGLE DAY. MORE PEOPLE GET SOLAR. IT'S INCENTIVIZE RATE PAYERS. IT'S SUBSIDIZED BY PEOPLE WHO CAN'T HAVE SOLAR. AND THOSE ENERGY RATES CONTINUE TO RISE. IT'S NOT EASY TO TAKE ON MY FRIENDS AND ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNITY WHO SUGGESTS THAT SOMEHOW I WANT TO KILL ROOFTOP SOLAR. SURE I'M A ROOFTOP SOLAR ADVOCATE I HAVE IT ON MY OWN HOUSE. BUT SOMETIMES TO BE A LEADER IN OUR COMMUNITIES WE HAVE TO BE HONEST WITH TO BE HONEST WITH OUR FRIENDS. AND WE HAVE TO BE ON OUR WITH OUR CONSTITUENTS. I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT THOSE PEOPLE WHO CAN'T SUPPORT THIS TODAY AREN'T BEING. COMPLETELY HONEST BUT MOST YOU HAD PRIVATE CONVERSATIONS WITH ME AND UNDERSTAND WHY THIS IS NECESSARY. IT'S HARD TO LEAD ON AN ISSUE LIKE THIS WHEN THERE'S SO MUCH MISINFORMATION. BUT REST ASSURED THAT MISINFORMATION ISN'T JUST HAPPENING BECAUSE PEOPLE IN THE FIRE MENTAL COMMUNITY LIKE SOLAR. IT'S HAPPENING BECAUSE OUR BIG SOLAR CORPORATIONS ON THE OTHER SIDE WHO ARE ACTUALLY PROFITING OFF THE SUBSIDY PROFITING OFF THE SUBSIDY THAT MY NEIGHBORS WHO CAN'T AFFORD IT OUR PAIN. AND SO THIS OPPOSITION HAS BUT NOT ORGANIC IT'S BEEN GENERATED AND MOST PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THE ISSUE IS. WE'VE TAKEN AMENDMENTS TO THIS BILL TO ENSURE THAT THOSE WHO HAVE ALREADY INVESTED ROOFTOP SOLAR ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO SEE THE INVESTMENT ON IT AND PAY IT OFF. I UNDERSTAND THERE'S APROBLEM WITH PEOPLE WHO LEASE SOLAR. I HAVE COMMITTED TO NRDC INTO TURN BOTH OF WHOM ARE SUPPORT IF AMENDED TO FIX THAT IN THE SENATE. IF YOU HAVE BEEN UNFORTUNATELY DUPED INTO A CONTRACT BY A SOLAR COMPANY AND NOW WE'RE STUCK IN A CONTRACT WITH IT IS NOT FAIR. TO FORCE YOU TO PAY OFF THAT CONTRACT WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO REAP THE BENEFITS OF THE SUBSIDY THIRTY SECONDS BUT FOR US IN THE FUTURE TO BE ABLE TO RELY ON RENEWABLE ENERGY WHICH WE'RE STILL GOING TO GET TO ONE HUNDRED PERCENT. I WILL REMIND I WAS THE LEAD CO AUTHOR. R. B. SB ONE HUNDRED TO GET TO A 100% RENEWABLE. IT'S GOING TO BE DONE IN A WAY IT HAS TO BE DONE IN A WAY THAT'S FAIR TO ALL CONSUMERS. AND IT CAN BE DONE AND IT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO ARKANSAS TO OUR CONSTITUENTS WHO CAN'T AFFORD INCREASING ENERGY RATES TO DO IT. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE ON AB ELEVEN THIRTY NINE. THANK YOU CONSULT. MISTER COOPER. FIRST MIKE UP. YOUR RECOGNIZED. THANK MISTER SPEAKER CALLING I RISE A PROUD COAL OF AB LET THIRTY NINE JUST. THE UC BURKE IN INSTITUTE AT HAAS WROTE A BLOG THE NET ENERGY METERING THEY'RE SAYING CALIFORNIA'S DISTRIBUTED SOLAR POLICY HURTS THE POOR IT REALLY IS THAT SIMPLE THEY'RE NOT WRONG FOR CENTRAL VALLEY IN INLAND REGION RESIDENTS THE PUSH TOWARDS RENEWABLE ENERGY ADDING TO THEIR STRUGGLE THE CURRENT STRUCTURE ALLOWS CUSTOMERS TO AVOID PAYING FOR FIXED COSTS IN THE MAINTAIN THE GRID MY COLLEAGUES AT FROM LA IN THE BAY AREA. YOU KNOW HOW HOT AND COLD IS UP HERE IN THE WINTER AND SUMMER SO OBVIOUSLY IF IN CENTRAL VALLEY USUALLY BILLS ARE A LOT HIGHER. FOR EXAMPLE. THE EXTRA. MONEY THAT RESIDENTS PAY TO SUBSIDIZE SOLAR POWER AMOUNTS TO REGRESSIVE TAX MAINLY PAID BY WORKING FAMILIES. WHO CAN AFFORD TO HAVE SOLAR THEMSELVES. THE ORIGINAL GOAL OF THE NAME PROGRAM WAS ESTABLISHED TEN THOUSAND SOLAR SYSTEMS. THERE ARE NOW OVER ONE MILLION HOMES WITH SOLAR. MISTER BUSH BE MORE EQUITABLE PROTOCOLS FOR CALIFORNIA'S MOST VULNERABLE RESIDENTS. IN AB ELEVEN THIRTY NINE THE MOTION IS STEP THAT. WHY SHOULD A SINGLE MOTHER. OR WORKING FAMILIES FOR SO AWESOME ELSE'S HOUSE. THAT'S A QUESTION THEY CAN AFFORD IT. THINK ABOUT THE NO HE EXAMPLE. FOR THE ARM EV'S THE REBATE PROJECT TEN YEARS OF DATA. FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLES. WE KNOW THAT PERSON ABOUT THE VEHICLES THE DEMOGRAPHICS ARE MALES THAT MAKE OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. IN HALF OF THOSE MAILS MAKE OVER A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. SO WHY SOMEONE BARELY STRUGGLING TO GET BY HELPING SUBSIDIZE THINGS LIKE THIS. THIS IS REASONS BILLS IMPORTANT. I WANNA THANK MY CLIMB FROM SAN DIEGO FROTHING THIS BILL. AND HAVE THE COURAGE IT'S IMPORTANT TO JUST BUILD THE RIGHT BILL THAT YOUR AYE VOTE. FAMOUS GOVERNMENTS CALDERON. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS I RISE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF AB ELEVEN THIRTY NINE WHILE OUR PUSH TOWARDS FORTY FIVE IS IMPORTANT WE SHOULD NOT BE ASKING. ARE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES TO DO THE HEAVY LIFTING. THE COST SHIFTING DUE TO NET ENERGY METERING IS BACKWARDS. MIDDLE AND LOW INCOME FAMILIES ARE SUBSIDIZING THOSE ABLE TO INVEST IN AFFORD ROOFTOP SOLAR. INITIALLY SUBSIDIES FOR SOLAR PROVIDED IN THE NINETIES TO HELP JUMPSTART THE INDUSTRY. SOLAR IS NO LONGER IN ITS INFANCY HOWEVER AND IT'S CONTINUED GROW SINCE THE LAST NAME AUGMENTATION OCCURRED IN TWENTY THIRTEEN. I'M ALSO PLEASED THAT THIS BILL MAKES A NEW SOLAR PROJECTS SUBJECT TO PREVAILING WAGES. THIS IS THE NECESSARY BILL TO PROVIDE EQUITY FOR THE MAJORITY OF ENERGY CUSTOMERS I'D LIKE TO COMMEND THE AUTHORED FOR ADDRESSING THIS REALLY IMPORTANT ISSUE AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE FOR AB ELEVEN THIRTY NINE. THANK YOU MISS CALDERON MR HOLDEN. YOUR ADDRESS. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. MEMBERS I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. THERE'S A LOT OF INFORMATION OUT THERE ON THIS BILL VERY LITTLE OF WHICH IS ACCURATE LET ME HIGHLIGHT. FIRST THIS BILL IS ABOUT RATES THIS BILL DOES NOT PREVENT ANY CUSTOMER FROM CHOOSING TO PUT SOLAR ON THEIR ROOFTOPS. SECOND THIS BILL IS ABOUT FAIR RATES FOR ALL REPAIRS REPAIRS ARE CURRENTLY PAYING TWO TO THREE TIMES MORE FOR ROOFTOP SOLAR THAT IS VALUE TO THE GRID OR TO THE RATEPAYERS. AND THE QUESTION IS WHY IS THAT. BECAUSE CURRENT LAW MANDATES THE CPUC TO ENSURE. THAT THE SOLAR INDUSTRY SO GROW SUSTAINABLY. THIS IS A THE HISTORIC MISSION OF THE CPUC. ITS MISSION IS TO ENSURE THAT THE COSTS RATEPAYERS PAY ARE JUST. AND REASONABLE NOT THAT PRIVATE CORPORATIONS MAKE MONEY. THIS BILL REMOVES THAT MANDATE FROM CURRENT LAW. SECOND THIS BILL ADDRESSES A GROWING PROBLEM OF COST SHIFTING. WE'RE GOING GREEN IN THE STATE THAT IS MANDATED BY LAW AND INDISPUTABLE THE QUESTION IS SHOULD WE PAY TWO TO THREE TIMES MORE TO GET THERE. AND I DON'T THINK SO AND I ASK FOR YOUR EYE ON THIS VERY IMPORTANT BILL THANK. THANKS HOLDEN MR MURATSUCHI YARD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I'D LIKE TO START OFF BY FIRST ACKNOWLEDGING. THE AUTHOR OFFER NOT ONLY CHAMPIONING. V. THE ECONOMIC INTERESTS ESPECIALLY OF OUR LOW INCOME AND WORKING CLASS COMMUNITIES I ALSO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE AUTHOR. FOR HER CHAMPIONING MANY ENVIRONMENTAL CAUSES OVER THE YEARS AND THAT. I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY QUESTION AS TO THE AUTHORS COMMITMENT TO FIGHTING AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE AND FIGHTING FOR CLEAN ENERGY. BUT I DO WANT TO EMPHASIZE AND THE REASON WHY I'M OPPOSING THIS BILL. IS BECAUSE AT THIS TIME WE'RE NOT SCIENTISTS ARE TALKING ABOUT HOW WE- HOW PERHAPS ALREADY PAST THE TIPPING POINT IN TERMS OF OUR FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE. THAT WE SHOULD BE INCENTIVIZING CLEAN ENERGY NOT ELIMINATING WHAT IS PERHAPS ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL PROGRAMS TO INCENTIVIZE ROOFTOP SOLAR TO INCENTIVIZE CLEAN ENERGY. FOR MANY HOUSE WERE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF HOUSEHOLDS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE AUTHOR RIGHTFULLY FOCUSES ON THE COST SHIFT ISSUE AND AS A MEMBER OF THE UTILITIES AND ENERGY COMMITTEE. WE HAD A ROBUST CONVERSATION ABOUT THE COST SHIFT ISSUE AND THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT THE COST SHIFT ISSUE IS A REAL ISSUE. AND THAT. WE'RE GETTING RUNNING OUT OF PATIENCE MANY OF US HAVE RUN OUT OF PATIENCE WITH. THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION TO FIX THIS PROBLEM OF THE CONCEPT. BUT LET'S REMEMBER. THAT THE CONCEPT. ISSUE IN TERMS OF THE COST COMING FROM CLIMATE CHANGE IN TERMS. OF THE WILDFIRE MITIGATION EFFORTS ALL THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT WE'RE SPENDING ON WATER MITIGATION. ON IMPROVING ON HARDENING THE GRID THOSE COSTS FAR OUTWEIGH ANY ROOFTOP SOLAR CREDITS THAT THE THAT FAMILIES ARE RECEIVING. UNDER THE NET ENERGY METERING PROGRAM. THIS IS A PROBLEM THAT NEEDS TO BE FIXED BY THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION THROUGH A THOUGHTFUL. STAKEHOLDER STAKEHOLDER DRIVEN PROCESS FOR ALL STAKEHOLDERS WOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ENGAGE. THE BOTTOM LINE IS THIS. WE NEED TO FIGHT CLIMATE CHANGE WE SHOULD NOT BE ELIMINATING ONE OF THE MOSTSUCCESSFUL INCENTIVES TO TOWARD CLEAN ENERGY AT THIS CRITICAL TIME. THANK YOU MYSTERIES HE DR QUIRK IN THE REAR CHAMBER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU VERY MUCH BICKERING MEMBERS. THIS PROGRAM I'M SPEAKING IN SUPPORT OF AB ELEVEN THIRTY NINE I'M A CO AUTHOR. I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYBODY IN HERE WHO KNOWS THESE PROGRAMS BETTER THAN I DO. RIGHT NOW THE ROOFTOP SOLAR PROGRAM IS HURTING US IN MEETING OUR CLIMATE GOALS AND THE REASON IT'S HURTING US IS THE COST OF ELECTRICITY IS BEING DRIVEN UP THIS IN FACT IS SEVERAL TIMES HIGHER THAN THE PROGRAMS THAT WE JUST MENTIONED. BY THE MEMBER FROM TORRANCE IT IS HIGHER BY SEVERAL TIMES. THE ACTUAL OF FORTY COST WHICH IS WHAT IS IN THE BILL NOW WILL BE ALLOWED TO THESE PEOPLE THAT INCLUDES THE SOCIAL COSTS. OF REDUCING POLLUTION ETCETERA BUT IF THESE PRICES CONTINUE TO GO UP AND LET ME TELL YOU HOW EXTREME THIS YEAR'S THE CUSTOMERS IN SAN DIEGO THE PEOPLE WITHTHE LOWEST INCOMES PAY A HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR MORE FOR THEIR ELECTRICITY BECAUSE OF THIS PROGRAM IT IS MUCH BIGGER THAN ANY OTHER PROGRAM WE HAVE IT IS TIME FOR ROOFTOP SOLAR TO COMPETE. ON ITS OWN. IF IT'S A GOOD TECHNOLOGY IF IT GETS THE THINGS DONE IF WE GIVE IT THE CREDIT IT SHOULD GAP. FINE I ALSO AGREE WITH THE AUTHOR WHEN SHE SHOWS WE CAN'T TRUST THE P. YOU SEE THE ACT BECAUSE FRANKLY THEY WORRY MORE ABOUT THE POLITICS THEN WE DO. THEY ARE NOT RELIABLE NOW SHE IS GIVING THEM I THINK IT'S NEXT SUMMER. TO GET IT DONE SUMMER OF NEXT YEAR. OF AND IF THEY GET IT DONE AND THEY DO A GOOD JOB THAT'S ALL WELL AND GOOD. BUT RIGHT NOW THIS IS HURTING US IT IS HURTING OUR CLIMATE GOALS IF WE DON'T REDUCE THE COST OF ELECTRICITY THEN PEOPLE ARE NOT GOING TO BE GETTING ELECTRIC VEHICLES THEY ARE NOT GOING TO BE GETTING ELECTRIC HEATING FOR THEIR HOMES. THEY WILL BALK AT THIS BECAUSE OF THE PRICES WE HAVE TO THINK IN EFFECT FOR THE CHAIR OF UTILITIES. THE MEMBER FROM PASADENA. THERE IS A WHOLE. FRAME THIS YEAR ON WE ARE NOT GOING TO INCREASE THE PRICE OF ELECTRICITY AGAIN. IT IS ALREADY TWO TO THREE TIMES MORE THAN ANY OTHER STATE. AND WE HAVE TO MAKE SOME CHANGES THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT WHAT I CAN THINK OF BECAUSE IT IS THE LARGEST IMBALANCE. PLEASE VOTE YES ON. ELEVEN THIRTY NINE THANK YOU. THANK YOU DR. MR STONE YOU ARE RECOGNIZED ME DESK. THANK YOU THE SPEAKER. MEMBERS THE IN. CAL HAS MADE AND ROOFTOPS HAS BEEN OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT CLIMATE BENEFITS. OF MANY OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE DONE AND THAT INVESTMENT THE INCENTIVES PUT IN PLACE TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO. PUT ROOFTOP SOLAR ON THEIR HOMES HAS SIGNIFICANTLY DRIVEN DOWN THE COST OF THE INSTALLATION THE COST OF THE SOLAR PANELS. THAT PEACE HAS REALLY WORK. WHAT WE NEED TO DO NOW IS TAKE APPROPRIATE STEPS INTO THE NEXT STEPS IN THE SOLAR ROOF BY ATTACHING STORAGE TO IT. BY ENSURING THAT WE CAN DEVELOP MICRO GRIDS BY REALLY ENFORCING THIS DISTRIBUTED GENERATION MODEL THAT WE NEED TO DO. SO ROOFTOP SOLAR IS THAT IMPORTANT TO CALIFORNIA AND TO KEEP THOSE INVESTMENTS GOING. BUT THE NET ENERGY METERING THAT WAS PUT IN PLACE WAS REALLY KICKING THE CAN DOWN THE ROAD AND WE ARE NOW PAYING FOR THAT CAN. AND IT DID SO BECAUSE IT WAS AN UNWILLINGNESS TO INVEST IN- GRAMS IN THE WAY WE NORMALLY WOULD AND PROVIDE INCENTIVES FOR ROOFTOP SOLAR MAYBE ADD AN EQUITABLE. PIECE OF OUR ELECTRICITY BILL TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THOSE INCENTIVES TO KEEP A ROOF TOP pTO DO WAS JUST BUILD IT INTO THE RATES AND STERN THAT GREAT THAT INCENTIVE TO MOVE IT FORWARD. THAT INCENTIVE NOW WORKS AGAINST ALL OF THE OTHER CLIMATE GOALS THAT WE HAVE THAT INCENTIVE NOW BECAUSE OF THE SUCCESS OF ROOFTOP SOLAR HAS ENDED UP WITH A THREE BILLION DOLLAR COST SHIFT. SO IT HAS TO BE ADDRESSED AND IT HAS TO BE ADDRESSED. NOW ENDED THE DRILL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE POLICY IS ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY IS AS APPROPRIATE LOOKING AT WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING TO PROTECT OUR ENVIRONMENT AND WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO DO THAT. VERMEILLE JUSTICE POLICY ALSO ASKED THE QUESTION WHO'S PAYING. AND WHO'S BEING LEFT BEHIND. AND RIGHT NOW BECAUSE OF THIS COST SHIFT WE ARE LEAVING. COMMUNITIES BEHIND AND PUTTING ADDITIONAL COSTS ON COMMUNITIES WHO WERE NOT SET UP TO BEAR THIS CAR. SO IN THIS BILL COUPLE OF THIGS THAT THAT ARE NOT ADDRESS IS HOW WE DEVELOP THAT NEXT INCENTIVE PROGRAM. IT WAS ACTUALLY IN THE BILL TO BEGIN WITH. AND IT WAS TAKEN OUT. AND UNFORTUNATELY AMENDMENTS THAT WERE PUT INTO THE BILL ALONG THE WAY WERE VERY REFLECTED WHAT THE INDUSTRY WAS ASKING FOR BECAUSE WHAT THEY WANTED TO DO WAS PAY FOR SOLAR ROOFTOP GENERATED INDUSTRY. L. GENERATION AT THE LOWEST POSSIBLE RATE WELL THAT'S NOT FAIR. THEY ALSO WANTED TO ATTACH AN ARBITRARY FEE FOR THE PLEASURE OF CONNECTING TO THE SYSTEM. WELL THAT'S NOT FAIR EITHER THOSE PIECES HAVE BEEN TAKEN OUT FORTUNATELY. SO FOR ME MOVING AHEAD WITH BREAKING DOWN THE INEQUITIES IN THE NET ENERGY METERING RATE STRUCTURE IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT AND WE NEED TO SEND A SIGNAL WHICH THIS BILL DOES TO THE PC TO GET IT DONE TO GET IT DONE NOW BUT NOT EXCEED TO WHAT THE INDUSTRY WANTS TO DO WHICH IS THE REAL THREAT TO ROOFTOP SOLAR. IS CHARGED ALL THESE ADDITIONAL FEES AND SUCH THAT THOSE INVESTMENTS CANNOT AND DO NOT PAY OFF OVER TIME SO NOT ONLY DOES THIS BILL PROTECT LEGACY INSTALLED SYSTEM. BUT IF THE RATE STRUCTURE IS CORRECT THEN IT WILL STILL ALLOW FOR. SOMEONE WHO PUTS ROOFTOP SOLAR ON TO RECOUP THAT INVESTMENT IN THE APPROPRIATE WAY BUT WE HAVE TO DO MORE. WE NEED TO INCENTIVIZE STORAGE AS A PART OF ROOFTOP SOLAR. AND WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT THAT THOSE INVESTMENTS IN THE FUTURE THAT WE ARE WE ARE. PUTTING TOGETHER THAT THOSE INCENTIVES. TO CONTINUE TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE DISTRIBUTED GENERATION AND THE ABILITY TO DEVELOP MICRO GRIDS AND BREAK OUR DEPENDENCE ON THESE LONG TRANSMISSION LINES THAT OR REALLY HOW THESE THESE. COMPANIES MAKE MOST OF THEIR MONEY OVER TIME AND PUT A CAP ON. THE JUST ASTRONOMICAL SPIRALING GROWTH OF ELECTRICITY RATES. IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE THAT UNDERMINES OUR ABILITY TO MOVE TO ELECTRIC HOMES IT UNDERMINES OUR ABILITY TO PUSH THE ELECTRIC VEHICLE PROGRAM TO THE EXTENT THAT WE REALLY NEED TO DO ALL OF OUR CLIMATE GOALS FOR ONE OF OUR CLIMATE GOALS IS REALLY WHAT THE QUESTION IS WE NEED TO MOVE THIS BILL FORWARD TO ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT ON AB. ELEVEN THIRTY NINE. THANK YOU MISTER STONE MISS CARILLO YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MR SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I ACTUALLY SIT ON UTILITIES AND ENERGY WITH OUR CHAIR FROM MY- MY NEIGHBOR IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA PASADENA AND THEN SOMETIME AROUND TWENTY NINETEEN WE HAD A HEARING RELATED TO THE NET ENERGY METERING AND WE ASK THE SAME QUESTION WHEN IS THE P. YOU SEE GOING TO ACT AND THE RESPONSE WAS FUMBLED IN THAT THEY HADN'T GOTTEN AROUND TO IT- IT HADN'T BEEN A PRIORITY THERE WAS CHANGES IN LEADERSHIP. A NEW PRESIDENT COMING ON BOARD LOTS OF EXCUSES AS TO WHY THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION HOW NOT NOT ACTED UP PERMISSION TO READ A LETTER THAT I WROTE TO THE P. YOU SEE ON JULY TWENTY TWENTY. WITHOUT OBJECTION. THANK YOU AND I'LL JUST- A SHORT A BIT. IN MY LETTER ON JULY OF LAST YEAR I WROTE NOW MORE THAN EVER POLICY MAKERS AND REGULATORS ALIKE HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE PURSUING OUR GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION GOALS AND TRANSITIONING 21100% CLEAN ENERGY IN A MANNER THAT ACHIEVES THE MAXIMUM BENEFIT AT THE LEAST POSSIBLE COSTS FOR CONSUMERS THE CURRENT STRUCTURE OF NAM FAILED TO ACHIEVE THAT OBJECTIVE BECAUSE IT MANDATES THAT UTILITIES PURCHASE EXCESS POWER GENERATED. FROM ROOFTOP SYSTEMS AT A RATE ROUGHLY TEN FIVE TIMES HIGHER THAN A CONVERGENCE FROM OTHER SOURCES IN ADDITION IT HAS CREATED A SIGNIFICANT COST SHIFT RAPIDLY APPROACHING TWO BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY THIS MEANS THAT CUSTOMERS WHO FOR WHATEVER REASON DO NOT HAVE THE CHOICE OR DESIRE TO INSTALL SOLAR PANELS ARE COLLECTIVELY PAIN TWO BILLION MORE IN THEIR ELECTRIC BILLS TO SUBSIDIZE THOSE WHO HAVE HOME BASED SOLAR SYSTEMS. I'D LIKE TO READ THE RESPONSE FROM THE P. YOU SEE THAT OBJECTION THIS IS FROM COMMISSIONER MARK DOUGLASS MON A- JULY THIRTY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY THANK YOU FOR YOUR LETTER I SHARE YOUR CONCERNS ABOUT THE NEED TO MODERNIZE. THE NEED FOR MODERNIZATION EXCUSE ME OF THE NON PROGRAM AND APPRECIATE YOUR LEGISLATIVE EFFORTS TO ENACT THESE REFORMS. AS YOU MAY KNOW THE COMMISSION IS PREPARING TO INITIATE RULE MAKING THAT WILL CONTEMPLATE THAT VERY SAME ISSUE YOU'RE RAISING YOUR LETTER. WE EXPECT TO ISSUE AN ORDER INSTITUTING RULE MAKING TO BEGIN THE PROCEEDINGS IN LATE SUMMER TWENTY TWENTY I ASSURE YOU THAT THE PRINCIPLES YOU LAID OUT ENSURING EQUITY. AVOIDING REGRESSION AND EXCESSIVE STRUCTURE THAN THEM AND BALANCING CONSIDERATIONS OF CUSTOMERS WHO LACK CHOICE WILL FULLY BE CONSIDERED WITHIN THE SCOPE OF NEW PROCEEDINGS. MY FELLOW COMMISSIONERS AND I SHARE YOUR GOAL OF ENSURING THE EQUITABLE EQUITABLE MODERNIZATION OF THE ELECTRIC GRID WILL MEETING OUR CLEAN ENERGY GOALS. WE HAVE OFTEN TALKED IN THIS BODY HOW BECAUSE OF THE SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME THE PREVIOUS LEGISLATORS WERE HERE AT A SIX YEAR MAXIMUM. OVERSIGHT OF DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES HAVE BEEN LACKING WELL WE ARE HERE LONGER. AND WE ARE TELLING THESE AGENCIES IN THESE DEPARTMENTS THAT THEY NEED TO ACT THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION HAS HAD. YEARS TO FIGURE OUT NUMBER FORM AND THEY HAVE FAILED TO DO SO AT THE COST. OF WORKING FAMILIES ACROSS THE ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND TO THAT THAT IS NOT FAIR. IT IS NOT JUST AND THEY ARE SIMPLY NOT DOING THEIR JOB. ELEVEN THIRTY NINE WOULD NOT EVEN BE NECESSARY. IF THE P. YOU SEE ACTED. AND DID THEIR JOB WHICH THEY HAVE NOT DONE SO. SO PUTTING PRESSURE AND ENSURING THAT WE CAN MOVE FORWARD IS THE APPROPRIATE RESPONSE AND I AM SO GRATEFUL TO ALL THE AUTHORS THAT ARE. SPEAKING ALL THE MEMBERS THAT ARE SPEAKING TODAY IN SUPPORT OF AB ELEVEN THIRTY NINE. THIS BILL DOES NOT KILL SOLAR. IT DOES NOT. IMPACT OUR GOALS OF TWENTY FORTY FIVE. IT'S SIMPLY ASKED THE QUESTION ABOUT EQUITY AND ENERGY WHICH IS A CONVERSATION THAT WE NEED TO HAVE. ADDITIONALLY I COME REFUTE. THAT YOU CAN ONLY BE AN ENVIRONMENTALIST OR CAN ONLY BE IN SUPPORT OF LABOR THOSE TWO ARE NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE. IF YOU TRULY BELIEVE IN THE GREEN NEW DEAL THE PILLARS OF THE GREEN NEW DEAL INCLUDE. PEOPLE FIRST WHICH MEANS PREVAILING WAGE JOBS UNION JOBS. DIGNITY AND THE WORK THAT YOU DO AND ENSURING THAT A JUST TRANSITION IF WE ARE TO MOVE FORWARD AND AWAY FROM OUR RELIANCE ON FOSSIL FUELS THAT YOU TAKE THAT JOB. WITH THE UNION WITH A PENSION WITH BENEFITS STARTING OUT AT APPROXIMATELY EIGHTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR IN TRANSITION. TO CLEAN ENERGY AT THE SAME BENEFITS AN EIGHTY THOUSAND DOLLAR A YEAR JOB DOES NOT EQUATE. TO A MINIMUM WAGE TWELVE DOLLAR FIFTEEN DOLLAR AN HOUR JOB THOSE ARE NOT THE SAME THING THAT IS NOT A JUST TRANSITION THIRTY SECONDS. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I AM IN SUPPORT OF AB ELEVEN THIRTY NINE. AND AGAIN I WILL SAY TO YOU ALL THIS BILL WILL NOT EVEN BE NEEDED HAD THE P. YOU SEE DONE ITS JOB AND I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISS CARRILLO. MISTER BRYANT FROM A DESK YOUR RECOGNIZE. WELL THIS IS THE BILL WE'VE ALL BEEN WAITING FOR RIGHT. IS THE ONE I'VE BEEN GETTING THE MOST CHATTER ABOUT THE DAY I WAS SWORN IN LAST FRIDAY. I GOT A LETTER FROM A CONSTITUENT. BECAUSE THIS CONVERSATION IS PITTED ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE AGAINST ECONOMIC GROWTH WORKING FAMILIES VERSUS SAVING OUR PLANET THIS IDEA THAT ONLY THE WEALTHY CAN AFFORD SOLAR PANELS. AND IS BEING SUBSIDIZED BY WORKING FAMILIES AND UTILITY COSTS. THE SOME TRUTH TO THAT. BUT THEY'RE ALSO FOLKS WHO TOOK FROM THEIR RETIREMENT. TO PAY FOR THE SOLAR PANELS UNDER THE PROMISE THAT IT WOULD PAY FOR ITSELF IN EIGHT YEARS. THAT'S ALSO TRUE. IT WAS A MISTAKE I'VE STRUGGLED ALL MORNING WITH OUR VOTING YES OR STAYING OFF OF THIS. I'M VOTING IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. AND I'M VOTING IN SUPPORT BECAUSE WE CAN'T SUBSIDIZE OUR GREEN FUTURE- PUBLIC UTILITY COSTS ON WORKING FAMILIES. AND WE HAVE TO INCENTIVIZE SOLAR INVESTMENTS AND GREEN INVESTMENTS IN A SERIOUS WAY WE MAY PROMISES TO FOLKS WITH NET METERING AND WE CAN MAKE THAT RIGHT WITH THE BUDGET WE CAN MAKE THAT RIGHT WITH OTHER LEGISLATION I JUST GOT HERE LAST WEEK BUT I'M WILLING TO WORK WITH ANYBODY TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN. BUT THIS IDEA THAT ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE AND ECONOMIC JUSTICE HAVE TO COME HEAD TO HEAD MEANS THAT WE'VE ALREADY FAILED. AND WE CAN DO BETTER. THIS BILL TAKES US BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD. THIS BILL START BY LIFTING UP THOSE AT THE BOTTOM I'M GOING TO BE VOTING YES. THANK YOU TO MY COLLEAGUES WHO BROUGHT THIS TO THE FLOOR. THANK YOU MISTER PRIME MINISTER GALLAGHER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS. MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT THIS BILL. IS BY THE UTILITIES AND FOR THE UTILITIES AND THAT'S ABOUT IT. LET ME START BY JUST JUST ASK YOURSELF. IF THIS BILL PASSES DO YOU THINK THAT THE UTILITIES ARE GONNA LOWER YOUR RATES. I'VE NEVER SEEN IT. ALL I'VE SEEN AS RATES CONTINUE TO GO UP IN THE STATE. IT HAS BEEN SAID WE PAY 80% MORE AS A RESIDENTIAL CONSUMER IN CALIFORNIA THAN PEOPLE ANYWHERE ELSE. IN THE UNITED STATES. ONE OF THESE UTILITIES IS RESPONSIBLE FOR BURNING DOWN AN ENTIRE TOWN. IN MY DISTRICT. THE VERY NEXT YEAR THEY RAISED OUR RATES. LET'S TALK ABOUT RATES AND WHY THEY'RE SO HIGH IT'S LAUGHABLE. TO HEAR PEOPLE SAY THAT IS THE NAME PROGRAM THAT IS CAUSING OUR RATES TO BE SO HIGH THAT SHOWS THE COMPLETE IGNORANCE OF WHAT'S GOING ON WITH RATES AND WHY THEY'RE SO HIGH LET'S START WITH R. P. S. YEAH WE ALL LIKE IT BECAUSE IT REQUIRES RENEWABLE INVESTMENTS. BUT GO BACK IN HISTORY. TO GET ALL THIS STARTED. MULTI MILLION DOLLAR COMPANIES BUILT UTILITY SCALE SOLAR. THAT WE ENTERED INTO CONTRACTS WITH LONG TERM CONTRACTS WITH THAT VERY HIGH PRICES WE'RE STILL PAYING ON THOSE CONTRACTS NOT AT MARKET RATES TODAY. LOW SOLAR BUT AT THOSE RATES THOSE RATES IN THOSE CONTRACT RATES MULTI MILLION DOLLAR COMPANIES. THAT ARE MAKING MONEY RIGHT NOW TODAY AND THAT IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST REASONS WHY YOUR RATES ARE SO HIGH. BUT IT DID HAVE A POSITIVE EFFECT IN SOME PEOPLE OF ALLUDED TO IT BY MAKING THOSE INVESTMENTS. AND BY THE MILLION SOLAR ROOFTOP INITIATIVE IT BROUGHT THE COST OF SOLAR DOWN SO THAT MIDDLE CLASS AND LOW INCOME PEOPLE COULD FINALLY AFFORD IT. BECAUSE BACK THEN THEY COULDN'T THE RATE THAT THE COST WAS SO HIGH. THOSE INVESTMENTS MADE IT SO THAT THEY COULD FINALLY AFFORD IT. AND NOW MANY OF DONE SO. YOU KNOW LIKE THE AUTHOR I'M I'M- I'M A FAMILY WHOSE ADOPTED SOLAR MAYBE I WAS A LITTLE LATE AND COME INTO THE GAME. BUT A COUPLE YEARS AGO I DECIDED TO DO IT. LET ME TELL YOU WHAT THE ANNUAL TRUE UP COSTS. FROM THE UTILITIES IN THE FINANCING COSTS BECAUSE I LIKE MANY CALIFORNIANS CANNOT JUST AFFORD TO DROP. CASH ON THE SOLAR SYSTEM I HAD TO FINANCE IT AND I'M STILL PAYING THAT FINANCING STORE A LOT OF CALIFORNIANS CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE GOING TO BE AFFECTED BY THIS VERY BILL BECAUSE RIGHT NOW IT ONLY AFFECTS PPA RESIDENTIAL CONSUMERS IT DOESN'T AFFECT THE BIG GUYS. IT AFFECTS THE LOW INCOME PPA CONSUMERS PEOPLE WHO CAN'T AFFORD TO. DROP MONEY ON THE SOLAR THEY'RE DOING IT BY FINANCING OR THEY'RE DOING IT BY LEASING. THAT'S TO THIS AFTER THE AMENDMENTS THAT TO THIS BILL AFFECTS ARE WE TALKING ABOUT BREAKING THE CONTRACT WITH THE BIG GUYS. WHO ARE PAID WHO YOU'RE PAYING ON A CURRENT LONG TERM CONTRACT. WAY HIGHER THAN MARKET RATES FOR SOLAR RIGHT NOW ARE WE TALKING ABOUT BREAKING THEIR CONTRACTS AND CHANGING THE RULES OF THEIR GAME. NO. YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT TAKING IT OUT ON THE RESIDENTIAL CONSUMER. TAKE IT OUT ON THEIR BACKS AND THEY'RE GONNA END UP PAYING MORE THEY'RE NOT GONNA GET THE CREDITS THAT THEY WERE PROMISED WHEN THEY DID IT. IS A PART OF THE REASON THEY DECIDED TO MAKE THAT DECISION. AS A GENTLEMAN FROM SANTA CRUZ POINTED OUT. YOU TALK ABOUT THAT WE SUBSIDIZE MANY THINGS WITH OUR RATES MANY THINGS. AND IF YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THAT SHOULD BE SOMETHING COMING OUT OF RATES OR SHOULD BE COMING OUT OF OUR GENERAL FUND. THAT'S A GOOD DISCUSSION TO HAVE. IF YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT VOLUMETRIC RATES ARE FIXED RATES AND- WHAT'S A BETTER WAY TO DO THAT MORE EQUAL WAY TO DO THAT LET'S HAVE THAT CONVERSATION. BUT DON'T PICK ON ONE PROGRAM. THE BY THE WAY HAS BEEN THE MOS RESPONSIBLE FOR GETTING ACCESS. TO LOW INCOME TO MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES. GETTING SOLAR IN THE STATE. IT'S NOT HELPING THE RICH AND NOW BY VIRTUE OF THE AMENDMENTS THIS BILL IS REALLY FOCUSED. ON THE LEAST OF THESE THAT CAN AFFORD. THEY GOT IN UNDER THAT PROGRAM THIRTY SECONDS. LAST YEAR THE UTILITY PLAYER CHARGED PLED TO MANSLAUGHTER. EIGHTY FOUR COUNTS PEOPLE WHO DIED IN MY DISTRICT. THEY PLAYED THE EIGHTY FOUR COUNTS OF MANSLAUGHTER IF THIS BILL PASSES TWO THOUSAND KANNST RESIDENTIAL CONSUMERS AND BUTTE COUNTY ARE GOING TO SEE THEIR RATES GO UP. ARE GOING TO SEE THEIR CREDIT TAKEN AWAY. MEANWHILE THEY STILL GOT TO PAY THE ILL THEY STILL GOT TO PAY THE FINANCING AND THEY STILL GOT TO PAY THE UTILITY THAT RAISE THE RATES AGAIN. THIS BILL IS FOR THE UTILITIES BY THE UTILITIES. MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT. YEAH I MEAN I GALLAGHER MEMBERS. DON'T GO DOWN THIS ROAD LET'S HAVE A LET'S HAVE A TRUE DISCUSSION ABOUT THE WHOLE PICTURE ABOUT ALL THE THINGS WE SUBSIDIZE. AND WHAT WE TO DO ABOUT RATES BECAUSE YOU'RE I AGREE WITH YOU THEY ARE WAY TOO HIGH. BUT LET'S DO SO THE REAL LET'S DO SOME REAL REFORMS NOT PICK ON ONE PROGRAM. AND HURT LOW INCOME AND MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES THAT HAVE ADOPTED SOLAR IN THE STATE I URGE A NO VOTE. THANK RICH GALLAGHER. MISTER RAYOS YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I WANT TO BEGIN BY SAYING THAT THE TRAGEDY IN PARADISE IS ONE THAT WE WILL REMEMBER FOREVER IT WAS A TRAGEDY AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE MUST LOOK TO REMEDY IN SOME WAY BUT I WANT TO GET BACK TO THIS BILL. THIS PARTICULAR BILL AB ELEVEN THIRTY NINE IS A BILL THAT I SUPPORT. AND I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR CHAMPIONING THIS IMPORTANT EQUITY ISSUE IN FOR WORKING WITH STAKEHOLDERS. TO HELP MEET THEIR CONCERNS. INCLUDING GRANDFATHERING THOSE WHO GOT SOLAR BEFORE THE IMPLEMENTATION WILL EXTEND TWENTY YEARS FOR THOSE. WHO HAD ALREADY INSTALLED THEIR SOLAR. ROOFTOP SOLAR IN CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN INCREDIBLY SUCCESSFUL DUE IN PART TO THE MANY EARLY ADOPTERS WHO COMMITTED TO CLEAN AND RENEWABLE ENERGY. HOWEVER AS HAS BEEN STATED BY SO MANY. THEIR SERIOUS INEQUITY THERE IS THERE IS A SERIOUS INEQUITY WHEN IT COMES TO NOW TO ENERGY METERING AND THE STRUCTURE AND THAT MUST BE RESOLVED. THE COST BURDEN CANNOT CONTINUE TO FALL AND LOW INCOME AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. OF THE STATE CONTINUES TO MOVE TOWARD CLEAN RENEWABLE ENERGY. IT MUST DO SO IN AN EQUITABLE MANNER. AB ELEVEN THIRTY NINE WILL STRIKE A BALANCE OF REFORMING THE NOT TO ENERGY METERING STRUCTURE. IF THE P. YOU SEE FAILS TO ACT AND UP TO NOW THEY HAVE FAILED TO ACT BUT IT STILL ALLOWS THAT OPPORTUNITY FOR THE CPUC CARE ACT. WELL WILL STILL REASSURE. EARLY SOLAR ADOPTERS THAT THEIR COMMITMENT TO INSTALLING SOLAR WAS NOT IN VAIN. THIS BILL WOULD ALSO ENSURE THE FUTURE PROJECTS CONNECTED TO THEM. PAY THEIR WORKERS A PREVAILING WAGE IT IS FOR ALL THESE REASONS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MS REYES. SEEING NO OTHER MEMBERS SEEKING RECOGNITION ON THE ITEM. MS GONZALEZ YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU I JUST WANNA- BE CLEAR ABOUT A COUPLE THINGS THAT WERE. MISGUIDED I WOULD SUGGEST- AND UNDERSTANDABLY SO I THINK IF YOU ARE. IT LIVED IN AN AREA WITH A FIRE AND DO BLAME THE UTILITIES AND I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT I IT- NUMBER ONE HAVE NEVER EVEN TALKED TO THE UTILITIES ABOUT THIS BILL. AT THE SUGGESTION THAT I. CARRY THE WATER OF A CORPORATION FOR ANYONE WHO KNOWS ME IT'S ALMOST LAUGHABLE. I DID TALK TO A LOT OF PEOPLE ABOUT THIS BILL. AND LEARNED A LOT ABOUT MY OWN PERSONAL DECISION TO GET ROOFTOP SOLAR IN WHO THAT COSTS. AND I'M EMBARRASSED QUITE FRANKLY I'M EMBARRASSED THAT I CONTINUE. TO BURDEN MY NEIGHBORS. BECAUSE THE TRUTH IS THOSE LARGE SCALE SOLAR. PLANTS FARMS THEY ACTUALLY PRODUCE A LOT CHEAPER THAN MY ROOF CAN PRODUCE AT. IT BRINGS DOWN THE COST OF RENEWABLE ENERGY. BUT EVERYTHING IS IMPORTANT WE NEED ALL OF THESE TO MEET OUR GOALS AND WE'RE NOT SUGGESTING IN ANY WAY THAT ROOFTOP SOLAR ISN'T PART OF THAT. FOR THOSE FOLKS WHO SIGN A PPA. YOUR RATES ARE LOCKED IN YOU DON'T GET THE NAME CREDIT YOU'RE GIVING THEM CREDIT TO A LARGE CORPORATION. RUN BY THE RICHEST MAN IN THE WORLD. THAT'S WHO MY NEIGHBORS ARE SUBSIDIZING. AND I KNOW IT MIGHT BE EASIER FOR ME TO TAKE THIS ON BECAUSE THE REALITY IS LESS THAN 1% OF MY CONSTITUENTS CAN AFFORD ROOFTOP SOLAR AND HAVE IT LESS THAN ONE PERCENT. I KNOW THAT'S NOT THE CASE FOR EVERYBODY ON THE FLOOR SOME OF YOU HAVE 15% BUT THE PEOPLE IN MY COMMUNITY SHOULDN'T BE PAYING FOR THAT. THIS IS THE BIGGEST COST THOSE WILDFIRE BECAUSE THEY'RE ALSO PUT ON REPAIRS. NOT SOLAR USERS. EVERY TIME WE ADD COST IT'S SHIFTING THE BURDEN. I AM COMPLETELY COMMITTED TO OUR ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS BUT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE THESE HARD CONVERSATIONS WE CANNOT BE TALKING ABOUT SWITCHING TO A ELECTRICITY RATES CONTINUE TO BE SHIFTED ON TO THE POOREST FOLKS WHO NUMBER ONE CAN'T AFFORD TO LET TRICITY NUMBER TWO. CAN'T ELECTRIC VEHICLE NUMBER THREE DON'T HAVE A CHARGING STATION I'LL NEVER HAVE SOLAR ON THE ROOFTOPS. WHAT ARE WE DOING. WHEN ARE WE GOING TO ACTUALLY TALK ABOUT HOW WE REACH THOSE GOALS IN A REALISTIC WAY THAT DOESN'T PUT ALL OF THE BIRD IN A WORKING CLASS FAMILIES. THOSE ARE MY CONSTITUENTS AND I WOULD GUESS EVEN FOR THOSE OF YOU IN WEALTHIER COMMUNITIES THAT YOU'RE STILL. JUST BECAUSE THEY THEY DIDN'T GET A LETTER FROM A SOLAR COMPANY TELLING THEM TO CONTACT YOU. KNOW WHAT NOBODY IS ORGANIZING THEM THAT'S OUR JOB. TO PROTECT THEM. PEOPLE WHO BOUGHT PURCHASED SOLAR UNDER A PROMISE ARE STILL GOING TO BE ABLE TO RECOUP ALL OF THEIR COSTS PLUS. AND QUITE FRANKLY THIS BILL GOES AWAY IF THE P. YOU SEE JUST DOES THEIR JOB. OR WE CAN WAIT. LIKE WE DID FOR. THE SMART PHONES IN THE DEAF AND DISABLED TO TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROGRAM TO TRIPS NINE YEARS NINE YEARS. THAT'S THAT'S THE KIND OF RESPONSE WE GET FROM THE PUCT I'M SORRY WE HAVE TO PUSH THEM ALONG I'M SORRY IT'S A HEARD BILL I'M SORRY WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT REAL EQUITY CONCERNS IN ABOUT THE REAL WORKING POOR CARE CUSTOMERS. ANOTHER THING WE SUBSIDIZE THEIR RATES IN ONE OF THE REASONS ARE RATES ARE HIGH BUT CARE CUSTOMERS ARE THEN TURNING AROUND AND SPENT IN HAVING TO PAY FOR SOLAR BUT DOES THIS DOES OF THIS MAKE SENSE ARE WE SPIRALING DOWN. IN OUR EFFORTSTO FEEL GOOD ABOUT OUR ENVIRONMENTAL POLICIES INTO AN UNSUSTAINABLE PERMANENT UNDER CLASS. BECAUSE WE'RE NOT LOOKING OUT FOR EVERYBODY. I SPENT MANY YEARS AT ORGANIZED LABOR TELLING OUR OWN FOLKS YES WE CAN HAVE IT ALL WE CAN HAVE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTIONS AND GOOD JOBS. TOOK A LOT OF CRAP FOR THAT. BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO DON'T BELIEVE THAT I STILL DO ON THIS FLOOR WHEN I VOTE FOR MANY OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL THINGS THAT COME UP. I'M ASKING YOU AS ENVIRONMENTALISTS ON THIS FLOOR. TO STAND UP AS WELL IT TELL THE TRUTH YES WE CAN HAVE BOTH BUT IT'S NOT HAPPENING RIGHT NOW. UNDER OUR NAME RIGHTS AND WE NEED TO REFORM IT. THIRTY SECONDS THIS BILL DID GET BIPARTISAN SUPPORT COMMITTEE. THE FARM BUREAU IS NOW NEUTRAL WE'RE WORKING WITH ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS TO COME OUT WITH THE BEST POSSIBLE SOLUTION I ASK THAT YOU REACH INSIDE AND STAND UP.

ASSEMBLY BILL ELEVEN EIGHTY THREE BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER RAMOS AND ACCORDING TO DESERT CONSERVATION MYSTERON US HE MAY OPEN THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE TODAY PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL ELEVEN EIGHTY THREE A BILL THAT WOULD CREATE A PROGRAM WITHIN THE ALREADY ESTABLISHED WILDLIFE CONSERVATION BOARD THAT WAS ESTABLISHED IN NINETEEN FORTY SEVEN. THIS WILL PROVIDE FUNDING FOR PROJECTS IN THE CALIFORNIA DESERT TO ADDRESS THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE PROTECT ENHANCE OR RESTORE DESERT HABITAT AND SACRED ANCESTRAL LANDS OF THE LOCAL NATIVE AMERICAN PEOPLE. IT ALSO PROVIDES PUBLIC ACCESS FOR RECREATIONAL AMENDMENT AMENITIES OR REDUCE THE THREATS OF WILDFIRE DROUGHT FLOOD AND OTHER CATASTROPHE EVENTS THAT CONTINUE TO HAPPEN MORE IMPORTANTLY THIS PROGRAM WOULD BENEFIT THE MANY DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES WITHIN THE DESERT REGION THESE ARE COMMUNITIES WHO HAVE SUFFERED DISPROPORTIONATELY FROM ONGOING ENVIRONMENTAL CRISIS AND ONGOING CLOVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC. THE CALIFORNIA DESERT'S MERIT INCREASE PUBLIC ATTENTION AND INVESTMENT THE DESERT REGION IS HOME TO THE LARGEST STILL INTACT ECO SYSTEM IN THE LOWER FORTY EIGHT STATES THESE LANDS PERFORM CRITICAL ENVIRONMENTAL ROLES INCLUDING CAPTURING AND STORING CARBON TO HELP US FIGHT THE CLIMATE CHANGE CRISIS THAT WE SEE TODAY. THE DESERT REGION IS ALSO THE HOMELAND OF NUMEROUS TRIBAL COMMUNITIES SINCE TIME IMMEMORIAL WHO CAN BENEFIT FROM THE DESERT CONSERVATION PROGRAM. WELL I WAS COUNTY SUPERVISOR FOR SEMINOLE COUNTY WE WORKED TO PRESERVE AN AREA KNOWN AS PRIORITY HOLE THAT HAD THOUSANDS OF PETROGLYPHS OF INDIAN ART DRAWINGS ON THESE ROCKS THAT WERE BEING- DESSA. BY THE VISITORS THAT WERE THERE THAT TYPE OF PROTECTION IS WHAT WE NEED IN THE DESERT COMMUNITIES. UNFORTUNATELY CALIFORNIA FUNDING INITIATIVES INCLUDING PASSED BONDS HAVE INVESTED FAR LESS CONSERVATION FUNDING INTO THE DESERT THAN OTHER AREAS OF CALIFORNIA PARTICULARLY THOSE REGIONS IN EXISTING STATE. STATE AREAS AB ELEVEN EIGHTY THREE PROVIDES A SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM BY CREATING A PROGRAM WITH THE WCB FOCUSED ON FUNDING IMPORTANT PROJECTS WITHIN THIS REGION. ALSO NGOS TRIBES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS RESOURCE CONSERVATION DISTRICTS AND OTHERS WOULD NOW HAVE A SPECIFIC PROGRAM FOR THE MANY IMPORTANT CONSERVATION RECREATION PUBLIC EDUCATION AND RESTORATION PROJECTS WITHIN THE DESERT.

THE BILL ENJOY BY PARTY SUPPORT IN FOR AS WELL THE PROBES RESPECT FOR ASK RIVAL. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN LACKING HERE RECOGNIZE. WHILE MEMBERS. I'D LIKE TO BEGIN SAYNG THIS IS SO FOR FORCE TO TAKE A AT UNDER. WHEN YOU LOSE TRACK WITH YOUR THIS IS THE KIND OF MEASURE THAT GETS BROUGHT FOR. BECAUSE WHAT IS FELT HERE IS THERE'S BEEN IN. AND FOR. OF PEDESTRIAN LOS. BECAUSE I'M TANYA IF YOU REALLY UNDERSTOOD THE DANGERS ASSOCIATED WITH PEDESTRIANS AND VEHICLES YOU WOULD NOT CONSIDER THIS AS A VIABLE OPTION. SOME OF THE MOST TRAGIC AND HORRENDOUS INCIDENTS THROUGHOUT MY CAREER HAD TO DO WITH WORKING. ADESTRA VERSUS VEHICLE INCIDENTS AND I'M TELLING YOU YOU MAY NOT THINK THIS IS LIKE SAYING LET'S PASS A LAW THE SAYS IT'S OKAY RUN A RED LIGHT IF YOU DON'T SEE. THIS IS BAD POLICY. I UNDERSTAND THAT I UNDERSTAND WHERE IT'S COMING FROM ESPECIALLY THOSE OF YOU WHO LIVE IN THE THEIR- WHERE TRAFFIC IS SLOW AND THERE'S- CIRCUMSTANCES TO WHERE YOU THINK YOU COULD JUST ACROSS THERE WITHOUT ANY PROBLEM. WELL I'M TELLING YOU YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE CHAOS. IS WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE YOU HAVE BACKED UP TRAFFIC YOU'RE GONNA HAVE PEOPLE PEDESTRIANS. FREE ROAMING THE ROADWAYS AND YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE BEEN PASSED YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE. REALLY UNMANAGEABLE CIRCUMSTANCES SO I UNDERSTAND. THE THOUGHT BEHIND US AND IT'S- IT'S MISTRUST AND I HOPE LAW ENFORCEMENT WILL. PAY ATTENTION I KNOW THAT THE- BE FAIR AND FORCING. LOST THANK YOU. DAVIS LACKING SAY NO ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THE ITEM MR TANG YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU MUCH I REALLY DO APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS FROM MY COLLEAGUE FROM LANCASTER PALMDALE THINK THEY'RE VERY WHERE. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE'VE ALL PROBABLY DONE IN OUR LIVES BUT I WOULD PROBABLY LOOK AROUND THIS BODY IN WONDER IF ANYBODY IN THIS BODIES EVER BEEN CITED. I KNOW REGARDING THE VEHICULAR QUOTE IT'S A VERY DIFFEREN SITUATION WHERE. PEOPLE DRIVE AT A CERTAIN SPEED LIMIT AND WE PROBABLY ALL BEEN CITED FOR SO THAT SEEMS TO BE pMECHANISM THIS ONE HOWEVER SEEMS TO BE VERY INDISCRIMINATE SEEMS TO UNFORTUNATELY BE DISPROPORTIONATELY HOPPING IN CERTAIN COMMUNITIES SO CERTAINLY STARTS BEING ENFORCED OF THE POOR OTHER COMMUTERS NOT. I THINK WHAT WE DO HAT WE'RE DOING IS TRYING TO SIMPLIFY THIS MAKE IT SO THAT IT IS SIMPLER TO IMPLEMENT THAN TO BE ENFORCED ACROSS THE BOARD MORE EQUALLY IN MORE EVENLY. WITHIN FOR COMMONSENSE MEASURE AND LIKE WE MENTIONED IN PARTICULAR THE STATE FIGHTS THE CITATIONS THAT I CITED WERE REALLY AROUND WITH ANGELES IN LONG BEACH IN PARTICULAR BECAUSE WE DID HAVE STUDIES AND DID HAVE DATA SO AGAIN WE THINK THIS IS A COMMON SENSE APPROACH IT DOESN'T TAKE THE ABILITY OF LAW ENFORCEMENT TO. NOT ENFORCE. ADESTRA IN IRVINE. OR A VEHICLE VIOLATIONS I THINK WHAT IT DOES IS IT SAYS. THAT PEDESTRIANS HAVE THE ABILITY TO CROSS THE STREET WITHOUT FEAR OF GETTING CITED. I TOTALLY AGREE WE DO NEED TO DO MORE AROUND THE VEHICLE ENFORCEMENT IN VEHICLE SPEED ARE COMPLETE SUPPORT THAT WE HAVE. IN OUR CITY BEEN FORCING FOR A PILOT TO REDUCE THE- SPEED LIMIT TO REALLY REDUCE- AND REDUCE TRAFFIC AS WELL AS TO ARRIVE NOT VERY MUCH MITIGATE TRAFFIC. I THINK TO BLAME- PEDESTRIANS FOR GETTING HIT BY CARS IS- YOU KNOW I DON'T WANT NOTHING THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID BUT I THINK THAT IS NOT THE RIGHT APPROACH EITHER SO AGAIN. WE ARE THIS IS WHAT A POINT WERE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO WALK. THE LAST THING THAT WE SHOULD DO IS TO PENALIZE PEOPLE FOR CROSSING THE STREET. WITH THE PRETTY SIGNIFICANT FUNDS WITHOUTA RESPECTFULLY ASK WILL ONLY BE TWELVE THIRTY. THANK MR TAN WITH CLERK WILL THE ROLE. IS THAT A VOTE ALL MEMBERS VOTERS OUT TO VOTE. ALL MEMBERS OF.

I RISE TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL. A. B. FOUR NINETY ANGELOS LAW WHICH SEEKS TO BAN LAW ENFORCEMENT FROM USING RESTRAINTS THAT CALLS POSITIONAL ASPHYXIA OR ASPHYXIATION POSITIONAL ASPHYXIA IS A DEADLY CONDITION THAT CAN OCCUR WHEN A PERSON BEING RESTRAINED. CAN NOT BRIEF. WHILE LAW ENFORCEMENT INTENDS TO INCAPACITATE OR RENDER A SUSPECT UNCONSCIOUS WE ALREADY KNOW THAT ARMBAR CHILL COOLS AND CAROTID RESTRAINTS ARE DANGEROUS AND OFTEN LETHAL. LAST YEAR MEMBERS AFTER HIGH PROFILE DEATH OF GEORGE FLOYD BY LAW ENFORCEMENT IN MINNEAPOLIS. SOCIAL UNREST TOOK PLACE ALL OVER THE NATION AND INTERNATIONALLY. RESPONDING TO THE COMMUNITY WITHOUT WASTING ANYTIME I AUTHORED LANDMARK LEGISLATION. AB ELEVEN NINETY SIX I MEAN IF YOU'RE ON THE FLOOR THE MAJORITY OF YOU ON THIS FLOOR SUPPORTED THAT BILL IN THE GOVERNOR SIGNED THAT BILL INTO LAW TO BAN LAW ENFORCEMENT FROM USING SHOKO. WE NOW NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL METHODS OF RESTRAINING SOMEONE DO NOT TURN. UNNECESSARILY DEADLY. AS WE ALL KNOW THAT OFFICER. WHO KNEELED ON GEORGE FLORES NECK DID SO FOR MORE THAN. NINE MINUTES AND TWENTY EIGHT SECONDS UNTIL HE LAID LIFELESS. IN DECEMBER ON DECEMBER THE TWENTY SIX TWO THOUSAND TWENTY SEVEN MONTHS AGO. ANGELO TITO MEMBERS YOU MAY NOT KNOW THAT INDIVIDUAL LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT ANGELO KETO A THIRTY YEARS OLD NAVY VETERAN FOR NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WHO WAS TRAGICALLY KILLED BY ANY ARMED POLICE. ANGELO I HAD BEEN SUFFERING FROM A MENTAL HEALTH EPISODE WHEN HIS FAMILY HIS FAMILY CALLED POLICE TO HELP. DE ESCALATE THE SITUATION BUT IN FACT THEY ESCALATED THE SITUATION POLICE RESPONDED AND AGILE LAID FACE DOWN BLOODY. HANDS CUFFED A RESPONDING OFFICER NEIL DON'T ANGELO KING SNACK FOR NEARLY FIVE MINUTES. NEARLY FIVE MINUTES MEMBERS. AND THEN WHEN HE GOT TIRED ANOTHER OFFICER. NERONE ANGELOS NECK AND TOOK OVER ANGELO LOST AND NEVER REGAINED CONSCIOUSNESS HE DIED AT THE HOSPITAL THREE DAYS LATER. HIS FAMILY WITNESSED THIS HORRIFIC TRAGEDY NO FAMILY MEMBERS EVER HAVE TO EXPERIENCE SUCH AN ORDEAL LIKE THE KETO FAMILY HAD TO EXPERIENCE THIS CIRCUMSTANCE OF ANGELO KEY DOES DEATH. OUR IS A STARK RESTORED PARALLEL OF GEORGE FLOWING. WHICH BOTH EXPOSE LOOPHOLES IN THE USE OF FORCE POLICIES GEORGE FLORES ARCHERD BREEZE. HE SAID THAT TWENTY TIMES ANGELO PINTO SAID PLEASE DON'T KILL ME. PLEASE DON'T KILL ME. IT'S NOT ABOUT LIGHTS. IT'S NOT ABOUT SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS. THIS IS ABOUT LIVES. THAT THE LOAN HERE. BUT THESE INDIVIDUALS HAVE BEEN TAKEN AWAY FROM US EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY AND THE RIGHT TO BREATHE. THIS IS A QUESTION WE SHOULD BE ASKING OURSELVES. EHRMANN OUR BROTHER'S KEEPER AM I MY SISTER'S KEEPER ASSEMBLY BILL. FOUR NINETY CREATE A UNIFORM STATEWIDE POLICY ON RESTRAINTS THAT CALLS POSITIONAL ASPHYXIA TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE RESTRAINTS ARE NO LONGER USE IN THIS STATE OF CALIFORNIA. MISTER SPEAKER PERMISSION TO USE THE PROPER. PERMISSION IN THIRTY SECONDS MISTER GIBSON. THIS BILL SIMPLY SAYS I CAN'T BREATHE. EVERYONE DESERVES THE RIGHT TO A BREEZE. WE'RE COUNTERING POLICE OFFICER. THANK YOU. THANK GOODNESS GIPSON MR LEE YOUR RECKLESS I LIKE TO THINK MY COLLEAGUES LOS ANGELES FOR BRING FOR THIS IMPORTANT BILLING SHEDDING MORE SPOTLIGHT ON THE MURDER VENTURE LOOKING SO JUST LIKE- THE OTHER IS ALREADY VERY ELOQUENTLY PUT THEY ARE VERY STARK PARALLELS THESE CASES JUST AS EVERY AS JUST AS EVERY ISSUE WE'RE CONFRONTING RIGHT NOW WITH THE ISSUE OF POLICE BRUTALITY OF MAKING SURE THE PROPERTY WERE RESPONDING TO MENTAL HEALTH CRISES ALL THOSE CASES THAT WERE LUMPED INTO ONE RIGHT HERE. ONLY LOOK NO MORE THAN AN HOUR AWAY FROM SOCCER AND WE ARE RIGHT IN THE BAY AREA AND TO SEE THAT SOMEONE A NAVY VETERAN A FILIPINO AND THAT WAS CALLING OUT FOR HELP WAS MURDERED ON HAN CAMERON FROM HIS FAMILY RIGHT HERE IN OUR STATE SHOWS THAT POLICE BRUTALITY AND THE FORCES THAT WE HAVE STILL YET TO REFORM FIX. OUR OUR- TO BE EFFECTIVE ON ANYONE NO MATTER WHAT THEIR SKIN COLORS ESPECIALLY ASIAN AMERICANS JUST AS MUCH ARE ARE VULNERABLE THESE THINGS. AND THAT'S WHAT'S ON BOARD TO DO COMMONSENSE THINGS LIKE THIS TO BAN. THE VAN POSITIONAL ASPHYXIA. TO NOT MAKE IT SO THAT SOMEONE HAS TO BE ASHAMED BECAUSE THEY CANNOT LONGER BREED. AND THOSE ARE THE COMMON SENSE THINGS THAT THIS BILL IS DOING TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE. NOT SUCCEEDED I'M NOT CERTAINLY KILLED WHEN THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE ESPECIALLY RAIN FURTHER FAMILY WHEN THEY'D BE NEED HELP THE MOST BECAUSE- WHEN PEOPLE CALL FOR NINE ONE ONE TO CALL FOR HELP. THEY'RE CALLING FOR HELP THEY ARE NOT HOPING THAT THAT WILL RESULT IN THEIR OWN TIME UNTIMELY DEMISE AND CERTAINLY THAT'S WHY I'M SUPPORTING THIS BILL IS A PROUD. CO AUTHOR ON THIS BILL AND WHEN TO TAKE THE AUTHOR AGAIN FIRST HARD WORK ON THIS AND I SAID- DR. THANK YOU MISTER LEE MR LACKEY. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS LET ME BEGIN BY SAYING NO ONE SUPPORTS POLICE MISCONDUCT NO ONE SUPPORTS TRAGEDY. AND I WILL TELL YOU HERE'S HERE'S ONE UNIQUE THING ABOUT POSITIONAL ASPHYXIA. IT'S A VERY COMPLICATED- SORT OF CIRCUMSTANCES. THAT THE IS IT THEMSELVES OF CERTAIN RESISTIVE CIRCUMSTANCES WHEN YOU HAVE. A SUSPECT. WHO- BECOMES EXTREMELY COMBATIVE AND IT IT DOESN'T ROUTINE BUT IT IT HAPPENS FAIRLY ON. REGULAR BASIS THAT YOU GET EXTREMELY VIOLENT AND RESISTIVE SUSPECTS. AND THAT REQUIRES INTERVENTION BY THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN CALLED TO PRESERVE THE PEACE AND RESTORE ORDER. AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS WHEN I'M TRYING TO TELL YOU FOLKS IS. MANY OF YOU CAN IMAGINE THE DEGREE TO WHICH SOME PEOPLE RESIST. TO THE POINT TO WHERE THEY KICK OUT WINDOWS IN THE PATROL CAR. THEY CONTINUALLY SCREAM AND YELL EVEN NO MATTER WHAT FORM OF INTERVENTION YOU TRY. SO WHAT HAPPENS IS YOU HAVE TO PUT ON LEG RESTRAINTS. UNLIKE RESTRAINTS COUPLED WITH HAND RESTRAINTS. REQUIRE A SUSPECT TO REMAIN. STEADY AS THEY ARE INSTRUCTED IN THE BACK OF THE PATROL CAR BECAUSE IF THEY MOVE A CERTAIN DIRECTION THEY WILL SELF INFLICT THIS POSITIONAL ASPHYXIA THAT WE'RE REFERRING TO. THIS HAPPENS WAY MORE OFTEN THAN IT SHOULD. BUT IT'S NOT THE PEACE OFFICERS FAULT. IT'S THE PERSON WHO HAS CHOSEN TO RESIST AND FIGHT AND NOT LISTEN TO INSTRUCTION THEY PUT THEMSELVES IN A VERY VERY GRAVE SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES AND THEY ARE TOLD THAT BUT YOU THINK THEY'RE LISTENING. IT'S NOT LIKELY. AND SO. TO BLAME OFFICERS IN ALL INSTANCES OF POLICE. NATIONALS PICTURE IS AN UNFAIR MANDATE. EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS THE TRAGEDY OF GEORGE FLOYD I HAVE NOT HEARD ANY ADVOCATES SAYING THAT THAT WAS NOT AN EXTREME TRAGEDY. MANY OF THESE TRAGEDIES THAT HAPPENED IN THE CUSTODY OF LAW ENFORCEMENT ARE REGRETTABLE AND SHOULD BE AVOIDED AT ALL COSTS. BUT TO SAY THE POSITIONAL ASPHYXIA IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE THE FAULT OF LAW ENFORCEMENT IS ALSO EXTREMELY UNFAIR. UNWISE AND UNJUST SO I'D ASK YOU TO VOTE NO ON THIS MEASURE. MR LOW YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER SPEAKER COLLEAGUES LIKE TO COMMEND OUR ASSEMBLY COLLEAGUE FROM CARSON FOR BRING THIS MEASURE FORD. WHEN I SAW THE OUR COLLEAGUE EARLY ON THE FLOOR TODAY HE SEEMED A BIT PENSIVE AND HE HAD A GREAT SENSE OF PURPOSE AN OBLIGATION ESPECIALLY WITH THIS MEASURE I ASKED HIM WHY HE SEEMED PENSIVE. EIGHT EIGHT OH HE WAS STRUCK BY THE CONVERSATION WITH THE CAN TO FAMILY A SPECIFICALLY ON THE OBLIGATION THAT WE HAVE BEFORE US ON THIS MEASURE. AND I RICH YOUR SUPPORT ON THIS AS THIS IS A SENSIBLE AND SURGICAL APPROACH TO MAKING SURE THAT WE CORRECT THE MISTAKES OF THE PAST A LOSS OF RECOGNIZING THAT WE HAVE A AN OBLIGATION. TO HELPING ENSURE THAT WE PROTECT MEMBERS OF OUR PUBLIC. I RESPECTFULLY ASK PRIVATE. THANK YOU MR LOW AND MISTER JONES SAWYER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED AT YOUR DESK. TODAY I RISE IN SUPPORT OF AB FOUR NINETY. TO PROHIBIT LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS FROM USING HARMFUL TECHNIQUES THAT PUT INDIVIDUALS AT RISK OF A FIXATION. I PROBABLY WANTED A FEW HERE. THAT NO FORTY YEARS AGO. THERE WAS THIS CHIEF OF POLICE NAME DEROGATE. AND WHEN IT CAME TO THE CHOKEHOLD AT THAT TIME. CHIEF GAVE THOUGHT IT WAS SHOWING COMPASSION AND SENSITIVITY. WHEN HE ASKED HIS AIDES TO CONFIRM HIS HUNT. MERCED HUNCH. THAT BLACKS MIGHT NOT RECOVER AS QUICKLY AS WHITES FROM CAROTID CHUCKLES. WE MAY BE FINDING THAT IN SOME BLACKS WHEN IT THE CHOKEHOLD IS APPLIED THE VEINS AND ARTERIES DO NOT OPEN AS FAST AS THEY DO IN NORMAL PEOPLE. THAT WAS FORTY YEARS AGO. NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO. AND YOU HAD THE CHIEF OF A LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY THAT BELIEVES. THAT PROBABLY DIDN'T BELIEVE THAT AFRICAN AMERICANS WERE NORMAL PEOPLE AND THAT'S WHY THEY DIED DURING THAT TIME. NOT BLAMING THE OFFICER PROBABLY NINE BLAMING HIMSELF. AND I THINK WHAT EVERYBODY IS TRYING TO DO IS COME UP WITH THE METHODOLOGY. THAT WILL NOT. ULTIMATELY HURT AND KILL ANYONE THAT'S INVOLVED IN A POLICE ALTERCATION I NOTICED TRUE FROM A VICE CHAIR OF PUBLIC SAFETY. WHAT WE DO HAVE TO DO IS MAYBE COME TOGETHER. AND TALK WITH EXPERTS ON AN ALTERNATIVE WAY. OF USING WHATEVER METHODOLOGY TO IT TO MAKE SURE THAT NO ONE ULTIMATELY DICE. BECAUSE AS CHIEF CASE WAS TRYING TO EXPLAIN. HE WAS TRYING TO BLAME IT ON THE PERSON. NOT THE TECHNIQUE AND NOT LOOKING TOGETHER. LIKE MY COLLEAGUE FROM CARSON MCCAULEY FROM PALMDALE I BELIEVE IT'S TWO OF THEM GOT TOGETHER AND TALKED ABOUT WHAT IS THE NEXT GENERATION OF READ THE BILL POLICE AND LAW ENFORCEMENT BEING ABLE TO PROTECT THEMSELVES. AND TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC AND TO PROTECT THE PEOPLE THAT THE ARRESTING THIRTY WE MOVE FORWARD- CHOKEHOLDS. DEVELOPED OVER TIME OF THE METHODOLOGY THAT MY VICE CHAIR TALK ABOUT DIDN'T HAPPEN OVERNIGHT IT DEVELOP OVER TIME AND THAT WAS THE BEST WAY OF DOING THINGS NOW WE'RE SAYING THAT MAYBE WE NEED TO TAKE IT TO THE NEXT GENERATION HAS ARRIVED I BELIEVE WHAT WHAT THE AUTHORS TRYING TO DO. IS GET US TO THAT- AND SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK EVERYONE TO VOTE FOR THIS SO THAT NOT ONLY THAT WE MOVE IT FORWARD. BUT BET POLICING STARTS TO MOVE FORWARD INTO THE NEXT GENERATION TO TWENTIETH TWENTY FIRST CENTURY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER JONES SAWYER. SEEING NO OTHER MEMBERS SEEKING RECOGNITION ON THIS BILL. MISTER GIBSON YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER SPEAKER AND THANKS TO MY COLLEAGUES FOR- YOUR YOUR REMARKS AND APPRECIATE EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU I WANT TO TAKE LIBERTIES AS THE THANK MY COLLEAGUE FROM PALM DEL LANCASTER I HONOR HIS YEARS OF SERVICE TO THIS STATE- AS A HIGH PATROLMAN I HONOR HIS WISDOM AND ALSO HIS EXPERIENCE. I ALSO FOUGHT WITH SIMPLY SAY- BECAUSE THE REDDICK WHAT HAS BEEN- THAT WE'RE TAKING A TOOL OUT OF THE TOOL BOX ALONG PORTSMOUTH THIS BILL SPECIFICALLY TALKS ABOUT- A PERSON'S ABILITY TO BREED- ANGELO CANTIL WHATEVER SITUATION HE WAS GOING TO WHICH IS A MENTAL ILLNESS HIS FAMILY CAUGHT NOT ONLY TO HAVE THE PLEASE COME IN RESPONSE TO DE ESCALATE THE SITUATION AS A MATTER OF FACT IT ESCALATE THE SITUATION- GEORGE FLOYD DIDN'T HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY. TO WANT TO EVEN GO TO BE BOOKED TO EVEN GO AND STAND BEFORE JURY OF HIS PEERS WHATEVER HE MAY HAVE BEEN CONVICTED UP HE WAS NOT GIVEN THAT OPPORTUNITY BECAUSE HIS BREATHING WAS RESTRICTED SO MUCH NINE MINUTES AND TWENTY EIGHT SECONDS AND HE DIED ANGELO KATO THIRTY YEARS OLD. WAS A NAVY VETERAN TO THIS UNITED STATES OF AMERICA- A TECHNIQUE THAT WAS USED IN PROPERLY THAT BECAUSE THIS YOUNG MAN TO LOSE HIS LIFE I'M SIMPLY SAID TO AB FOR NINETY IT'S ABOUT GIVING UP INDIVIDUALS THE ABILITY TO BRIEF JUST LIKE EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO BREATHE NO FAMILY SHOULD HAVE TO GO THROUGH WITH THE KEEP THE FAMILY HAS BEEN THROUGH- MEMBERS I RESPECTFULLY ASK.

ASSEMBLY BILL THIRTEEN FIFTY SIX BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF OUR QUE HAN AND OTHERS AMERICA LIVING THE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE SERVICES THIS PARA QUE HAN. THANK YOU MR SPEAKER AND MEMBERS TODAY I RISE TO PRESENT AB THIRTEEN FIFTY SIX THIS IS A CRITICAL PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT UPDATES ARE LAWS TO ADDRESS THE THREATS THE PATIENTS AND PROVIDERS AT A REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CLINIC SPACE. ROE VERSUS WADE IS THE LAW OF THE LAND PEOPLE HAVE A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO SEEK SERVICES FOR REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CLINICS. WITHOUT THEIR FREE WILL BEING VIOLATED. THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT WHEN SOMEONE GOES TO SEEK HEALTH CARE THEY'RE ENTITLED TO. THEY SHOULD DO SO FREELY AND WITHOUT INTIMIDATION OR FEAR OF VIOLENCE. HOWEVER THE LAWS PROTECTING THIS RATE HAVEN'T BEEN UPDATED SINCE THE TWO THOUSANDS SENSE THEN PROTESTERS A CLINICS HAVE BECOME DRASTICALLY MORE EXTREME IN THEIR TACTICS AND POWERED BY ADVANCES IN TECHNOLOGY. EXTREMIST PROTESTERS. RETURNED DAY AFTER DAY HARASSING IN FILMING PATIENTS AND PROVIDERS THEY POST THESE IMAGES ON WEBSITES WITH PROVIDERS PERSONAL INFORMATION SEARCHABLE FOR MILLIONS TO SEE. EACH AND EVERY ONE OF US IS PROTECTED IN THE PRIVACY OF WHAT HEALTH CARE WE RECEIVE HER HEAD BACK. IT SHOULD BE NO DIFFERENT FOR REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH PATIENTS.

THANK YOU MR SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I RISE TO PRESENT AB NINE EIGHT EIGHT. WE JUST LISTEN TO OUR COLLEAGUE. FROM LOS ANGELES SPEAK IN PASSION AND- ABOUT ANGELO CAN TELL IN HIS LIFE BEING TAKEN. ANGELO CAN SHOW IS IN THE MIDST OF A SCHIZOPHRENIC EPISODE WHEN HIS SISTER AND HIS MOTHER WERE AFRAID BECAUSE HE WAS HUGGING THEM A LITTLE TOO TIGHTLY. THEY NEEDED HELP. WHEN PEOPLE NEED HELP WHO THEY CALL. THEY CALL NINE ONE ONE. AND LAW ENFORCEMENT SHOWED UP. AND THAT EVENING AND LOOK INTO DIED. MILES HALL TODAY ONE TODAY'S THE ANNIVERSARY OF MILES HALL'S DEATH. MILES HALL IS AN INCREDIBLE YOUNG MAN WHO LIVED IN MY DISTRICT. HE WAS ALSO SUFFERING FROM MENTAL ILLNESS. HIS INCREDIBLE MOTHER HAD DONE EVERYTHING SHE COULD TO GET THE RESOURCES SHE NEEDED TO GET MILES THE HELP HE NEEDED WHEN HE WAS IN CRISIS. SHOULD CALL THEIR LOCAL POLICE DEPARTMENT TO MAKE SURE THEY KNEW. WHO MILES WAS TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN HE WAS IN AN EPISODE THEY WOULD TREAT HIM THE WAY HE DESERVES TO BE TREATED. BUT ON THE DAY THAT MILES WAS KILLED SHE NEEDED HELP. SO SHE CALLED NINE ONE ONE AND LAW ENFORCEMENT ARRIVED. AND HE WAS KILLED SHORTLY THEREAFTER. WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT SAYS THAT THOSE SUFFERING FROM MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS DESERVE A HEALTH CARE IN A MENTAL HEALTH CARE RESPONSE. AND THAT MY FRIENDS IS NOT TOO MUCH FOR CALIFORNIANS TO EXPECT THEY SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO A SYSTEM BY WHICH WHEN THEY ARE SUFFERING FROM MENTAL ILLNESS. THEY DON'T TURN TO LAW ENFORCEMENT WHO ARE TRAINED TO DEAL WITH MENTAL ILLNESS THEY TURNED TO TRAINED PROFESSIONALS WHO CAN DEAL WITH MENTAL HEALTH CARE NEEDS. SO THIS BILL. WHICH NOW JUSTICE ALLERGIES OR INTENT TO FOLLOW THROUGH ON WHAT CONGRESS UNANIMOUSLY MY FRIENDS REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS IN WASHINGTON. GOT TOGETHER UNANIMOUSLY. PRESIDENT TRUMP SIGNED ENABLING LEGISLATION INTO LAW SAYING THAT WE AS A STATE HAVE THE POWER TO SET UP THE NINETY EIGHT SYSTEM TO ENSURE THE CALIFORNIANS HAVE ACCESS INTO A REAL AND MEANINGFUL MENTAL HEALTH CARE CRISIS RESPONSE SYSTEM. SO THIS BILL WILL PUT US ON THE PATH FORWARD TO SETTING UP THAT STRUCTURE. AND I ASK FOR YOU TO BE MY PARTNERS IN THIS BECAUSE CALIFORNIANS DESERVE THIS RESPONSE THE 25% OF THOSE. WHO WERE SHOT BY OFFICERS WHO ARE SUFFERING FROM MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS RESPONSE CRISIS DESERVE THIS THE 30% OF THE HOMELESS PEOPLE ON OUR STREETS WHO ARE SUFFERING. FOR MENTAL HEALTH.

THESE EMISSIONS WORSEN AIR QUALITY AND NEGATIVELY IMPACT HUMAN HEALTH CAUSING ASTHMA AND LUNG DISEASE AND OTHER AWFUL HEALTH IMPACTS ON LANDSCAPING PROFESSIONALS ARE BREATHING. EXHAUST DAY IN AND DAY OUT. THE GOOD NEWS IS THERE IS EMISSION. OF A FOR ALL OF THE EQUIPMENT IN THE SMALL ENGINE CATEGORY. THAT WOULD FALL UNDER THIS BILL. I WANT TO BE CLEAR ABOUT TWO IMPORTANT POINTS. FIRST THIS BILL DOES NOT APPLY TO A QUITMAN PURCHASE PRIOR TO TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. IT IS NOT A RESTRICTION ON USE ONLY NEW SALES. SECOND FARM AND CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT ARE PREEMPTED. UNDER THE FEDERAL CLEAN AIR ACT AND ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THIS BILL. ABOUT HALF OF HOUSEHOLDS HAVE ALREADY SWITCHED TO ZERO EMISSION EQUIPMENT. BUT IT WILL TAKE MORE TO TRANSITION COMMERCIAL USERS TO ZERO EMISSIONS. TO THAT END AB THIRTEEN FORTY SIX REQUIRES THAT FUNDING BE MADE AVAILABLE FOR LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS TO OFFER COMMERCIAL REBATES. TO HELP LANDSCAPERS PURCHASE ZERO EMISSION EQUIPMENT. SEVERAL AIR DISTRICTS LIKE SOUTH COAST AND VALLEY AIR ALREADY OFFER COMMERCIAL REBATE PROGRAMS. AND INSTITUTIONS LIKE THE CITY OF SOUTH PASADENA HAVE ALREADY TRANSITIONED. TO FULLY ZERO EMISSION LANDSCAPING. ZERO MISSION AGREEMENT IS QUIET WHICH ALL OF YOUR CONSTITUENTS WILL APPRECIATE.

ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY TWO BY ASSEMBLY WERE MCCARTY AND OTHERS ARE NOT GOING IS HEALTHCARE MCCARTY WERE OPEN ON THE- THANK YOU MADAM. I HERE TO PRESENT AB TWENTY TWO THIS IS THAT WE SAY THIS A LOT BUT I CAN TRULY SAY THIS IS A TRANSFORMATIONAL BILL THAT WILL CHANGE LIVES IN CALIFORNIA FOR KIDS. AND FAMILIES BY PROVIDING UNIVERSAL ACCESS TO TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN THIS HAS BEEN A TWENTY FIVE YEAR- QUEST FOR MANY PEOPLE IN THE STATE I JUST WANT TO BRIEFLY RECOGNIZE. THE LAWMAKERS THAT INTRODUCED THIS BILL BEFORE TO HELP GET THIS THIS POINT. THEN ASSEMBLYMEMBERS DILLANE EASTON DEBRA R. TEASE FORMER SENATORS JOSEPH MEDIAN DARRELL STEINBERG AND RECENTLY OUR COLLEAGUES IN THE SENATE CENTERS DODD AND GONZALEZ. PUSH THIS ISSUE FORWARD THIS HAS BEEN AN ELUSIVE GOAL BUT HERE WE ARE TODAY. COUPLED WITH THE ACTIONS IN THE BUDGET THIS AGAIN WILL CHANGE LIVES FOR KIDS FAMILIES AND OUR STATEOF CALIFORNIA. WE KNOW FOR OUR KIDS EARLY EDUCATION MATTERS ALL THE BRAIN DEVELOPMENT SAYS OVER AND OVER IF THERE'S ONE THING THAT YOU COULD DO TO CHANGE THE TRAJECTORY OF THE KIDS SUCCESS IN LIFE. PROVIDE HIGH QUALITY EARLY EDUCATION. KIDS IN CALIFORNIA ALREADY CAN GO TO T. K. IF YOU'RE BORN IN THE FALL SO WE HAVE AN INEQUITY WHICH MY COLLEAGUE IN SAN FRANCISCO ARE BUDGET YOU'RE ALWAYS POINTED OUT. 25% THE KIDS HAD SUBSIDIZED PRE K. AND THE OTHER KIDS DID NOT SO WORKING FAMILIES AND SO MANY OF OUR COMMUNITES. CAN'T AFFORD THE THOUSAND OR TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH FOR EARLY EDUCATION IT. COSTS MORE TO GO TO. TAKE PRE KAYPRO PRIVATE PROGRAMS THE UNIVERSE OF. AT BERKELEY. AND WE THAT TOO MANY OF OUR FOR. WHO CALL. FOR STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM ARE LIVING IN POVERTY SO IF YOU'RE A MIDDLE CLASS FAMILY. YOU ARE TOO POOR. TO PAY FOR PRE K. YOURSELF BUT YOU'RE TOO RICH TO GET THE SUBSIDIZED PROGRAM SO THAT HURTS FAMILIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA THIS WILL BE A BOON FOR WORKING CLASS FAMILIES BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY FOR A STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE KNOW IF WE WANT TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES LIKE. ARE STUBBORN ACHIEVEMENT GAP WHICH IS REALLY AN OPPORTUNITY GAP TOO MANY KIDS START KINDERGARTEN BEHIND AND THEY STAY BEHIND IF YOU WANT TO DO THE DRESS THAT WHAT'S THE NUMBER ONE REMEDY FUND EARLY EDUCATION. YOU WANT TO ADDRESS INTERGENERATIONAL POVERTY MAKING SURE THAT OUR YOUNG KIDS HAVE A CHANCE FOR ECONOMIC SUCCESS HIGH QUALITY EARLY EDUCATION IS THE REMEDY YOU WANT TO ADDRESS CRIMINAL JUSTICE ISSUES RESEARCH SHOWS THAT. YOU WANT TO KEEP THE KID OUT OF THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM THE ONE THING THAT YOU CAN DO MAKE SURE THEY HAVE A QUALITY EARLY EDUCATION. SO RIGHT NOW WE SPEND. ALMOST A BILLION DOLLARS TO FIND FOUR YEAR OLDS TO GO TO STATE PRESCHOOL AND NOW THOSE FOUR YEAR OLDS WHO LIVE IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES CAN GO TO FOR STATE PRESCHOOL AS A THREE YEAR OLD. AND THEN GET A YEAR OF TEEKAY AS A FOUR YEAR OLD SO TWO YEARS OF HIGH QUALITY EARLY YET. AGAIN WE'LL TELL TRAINS LIVES. AND LASTLY I DID WANT TO NOTE THERE ARE MANY PROVIDERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE WHO ARE NERVOUS ABOUT THIS. BECAUSE LET'S FACE IT CHANGE IS HARD. BUT REST ASSURED. THIS COUPLE WHETHER BUDGET ACTIONS WE'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE. THAT NO ONE IS LEFT BEHIND OUR PROVIDERS AND OUR CENTER BASED PROGRAMS THAT DOING BEEN DOING THE WORK. FOR DECADES WE'RE GONNA MAKE SURE WE LIFT YOU UP. AND YOU CAN SERVE MORE INFANTS AND TODDLERS AND THREE YEAR OLDS. AND FRANKLY WE'RE GONNA NEED MORE EDUCATORS ANYWAY IN EARLY EDUCATION BASED UPON THIS TICKET EXPANSION. AND THAT SUBSEQUENT BUDGET ACTIONS SO WITH THAT I WANT TO THANK THE TWENTY FIVE PLUS JOINT AUTHORS ON THIS FLOOR. WHO STOOD BEHIND AB TWENTY TWO. AND ASK FOR YOUR VOTE TODAY ON THIS MONUMENTAL BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR MCCARTY NETWORKS YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER IN MEMBERS I RISE AS A JOINT AUTHOR ON THIS BILL TODAY- BUT ALSO AS A MOM A MOM OF A FOUR YEAR OLD AND A MOM OF A TEN MONTH OLD. THE CUTEST CHILDREN YOU'VE EVER SEEN OUR BUT I'M BIASED. AND AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM SACRAMENTO SAID EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT THIS IS ONE OF THE WAYS THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY TRULY ADDRESS THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP. GIVING ACCESS TO ALL FOUR YEAR OLDS TO FULL DAY TKA. IN THE STATE MY DAUGHTER. I HAPPEN TO BE BORN IN NOVEMBER SO SHE'S STARTING TO QUE IN AUGUST AND OAKLAND UNIFIED PUBLIC SCHOOL DISTRICT. SO SHE'S ONE OF THE 25% THAT ACTUALLY IS ABLE TO GO THERE BUT EITHER 70% THE KIDS. DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO GO THERE. AND THEY ARE PAYING. UPWARDS OF TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS A FOR FREE. IF THEY DON'T QUALIFY FOR. CARE CHILD CARE RIGHT NOW IN CALIFORNIA IS AS MY COLLEAGUE SAID- MORE EXPENSIVE AND SENDING MY CHILD TO UNIVERSITY AND I'M- I GOT IT I'M PAYING IT FOR TWO KIDS AT THE MOMENT. FOR THOSE PARENTS THAT ARE OUT HERE I KNOW YOU ALL ARE DOING THE SAME EXACT THING RIGHT NOW. SO THE ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO SEND THEIR CHILDREN TO A QUALITY. FULL DAY T. K. PROGRAM IS CRITICAL FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND I THINK TRULY. WILL GIVE US THE ABILITY TO REALLY FUNDAMENTALLY ADDRESS. THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP. I ALSO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE HOWEVER SOME OF THE CONCERNS BY THE EARLY CHILDHOOD CARE PROVIDERS THAT I HAVE HEARD FROM I'VE HEARD FROM THE E. C. COMMUNITY. NOT ONLY FOR MY DISTURBANCE FROM ACROSS THE STATE. IN TERMS OF THEIR CONCERNS. ARE EASY PROVIDERS. HAVE JUST GONE THROUGH A PRETTY DRAMATIC EXPERIENCE OVER THE PAST YEAR MANY OF THESE. SCHOOLS HAVE CLOSED BECAUSE OF COVERED. AND WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT AND WORK WITH THEM. AND ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE THE RESEARCH RESOURCES THAT THEY NEED TO BE SUCCESSFUL AND PART OF THAT. IS GOING TO BE. THE FULL EASY BUDGET A BILL PACKAGE THAT WILL MAKE HIS HISTORIC INVESTMENTS INTO OUR EASY COMMUNITY. SEPARATELY FROM THE T. K. PROGRAM. WHICH INCLUDES INCREASING OUR REIMBURSEMENT RATES INCREASING AMOUNT OF SLOTS THAT WE HAVE FOR OUR CHILDREN. GIVING OUR PROVIDERS THE FLEXIBILITY TO SERVE OUR YOUNGER KIDS. AND MAKING SURE WE HAVE WRAPAROUND SERVICES FOR FULL DAY CARE FOR T. K. AND ALSO INVESTING IN OUR- OUR EARLY EDUCATION OUR OUR OUR EARLY EDUCATOR PIPELINE TO ENSURE WE HAVE THE WORK FORCE TO BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE ALL OF THIS. AND I THINK THAT IS WHAT- ARE FULL BUDGET WILL DO I AM COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH ARE YOU SEE COMMUNITY- I'M EXCITED ABOUT THE T. K. BILL AND I WILL BE AN ALLY OF THE U. C. COMMUNITY. WORKING WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM SACRAMENTO AND MANY OTHERS HERE TO ENSURE THAT. ALL OF OUR KIDS KIDS NO MATTER WHERE YOU LIVE NO MATTER WHAT COLOR SKIN YOU HAVE HAVE THE ACCESS TO GOOD QUALITY. FREE PUBLIC EDUCATION THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU S. WICKS MISSED YOU AND YOU ARE. RECOGNIZED THANK. THANK YOU SPEAKER I TO AS A PER COOPER IN SUPPORT OF A TWENTY TWO I WANT THE AUTHOR HIS WORK ON THE SIMPLE BILL HIS PASSION DATA YEAR AFTER YEAR I'VE BEEN PROUD TO HAVE BEEN ABLE TO JOIN HIM THIS YEAR BUT NOT ONLY THAT BUT ALSO WHEN I WAS IN MY SEAT IN THE SENATE AS WELL. AS A FULL TIME WORKING MOTHER OF TWO ELEMENTARY SCHOOL BOYS I UNDERSTAND IMPORTANCE PROVIDE TKA EDUCATION TO WORKING FAMILIES MY BOYS BENEFIT FROM. PRE K. AFTER WATCHING MY BOYS GO THROUGH PRE K. I HAVE DEFINITELY BECOME A HUGE SUPPORTER AND AN ADVOCATE FOR ALL CHILDREN. TO BE ABLE TO ATTEND PRE K. TKA HAS BEEN PROVEN TO GIVE OUR CHILDREN A SIGNIFICANT BOOST IN READING AND MATH SKILLS PARTICULARLY FOR LOW INCOME STUDENTS AND ESPECIALLY DUAL LANGUAGE LEARNERS. IN 200-015-2000 SIXTEEN SCHOOL YEAR ONLY 33% UNDER ONLY 33% OF CHILDREN UNDER FIVE WHO QUALIFY FOR ONE OF CALIFORNIA'S PUBLICLY FUNDED. EASY PROGRAMS WERE SERVE. ONLY THIRTY THREE PERCENT. HOW T. K. PROGRAMS OR EXPERIENCE INSIGNIFICANT. INSUFFICIENT FUNDING AND A LACK OF CHILD CARE PROVIDERS ALL OF OUR CHILDREN DESERVE MORE PERSONALIZED ATTENTION IN THE CLASSROOM AND THIS BILL IS THE ANSWER TO MORE CHILDREN BEING SERVED. AB TWENTY TWO PROVIDES PARENTS WITH A FREE HIGH QUALITY PRE K. OPTION WHY MAINTAINING PARENT CHOICE AS FAMILIES CAN CHOOSE THE CHILD CARE PROGRAM THAT BEST MEETS THEIR UNIQUE NEEDS. CAN PARENTS COULD CHOOSE FROM C. S. P. P. WHICH IS CALLED FOR STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS HEAD START PRIVATE PRESCHOOL GENERAL CHILD CARE OR ANY OTHER PROGRAM THAT WORKS BEST FOR THEIR FAMILY. MEMBERS I ASK YOU TO JOIN ME IN SUPPORTING THE WORKING FAMILIES AND SINGLE PARENTS IN OUR COMMUNITY HELP ALL CALIFORNIA CHILDREN THANK YOU THANK YOU MATTHEW AND MY FELLOW THERE IF YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MOUNTAINS. AND I. ALSO TO AS PROUD OFF OF AB TWENTY TWO- I STARTED MY NONPROFIT CAREER WELL OVER A DECADE AGO AS AN ADVOCATE FOR UNIVERSAL PRESCHOOL I WELL THIS IS- TKA THIS REALLY IS A REALLY PROUD MOMENT FOR ME. AND ADVOCATING FOR ALL FOUR YEAR OLDS TO HAVE ACCESS. I'M ALSO AS A WORKING MOTHER OF A FOUR YEAR OLD I SEE EVERY DAY HOW MUCH SHE HAS GROWN HOW MUCH SHE HAS LEARNED. BECAUSE SHE HAS ACCESS TO PRESCHOOL BECAUSE SHE'S HAD ACCESS TO A QUALITY EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION. WHAT MANY OF YOU MAY NOT KNOW IS BEFORE I CAME TO THE STATE ASSEMBLY I WAS A PRESCHOOL PROVIDER AND CHILD CARE PROVIDER. MY MOM OPENED A PRESCHOOL. AND BECAUSE SHE WANTED TO GAVE THE UNDERSERVED. KIDS IN OUR COMMUNITY ACCESS TO A QUALITY LEARNING EXPERIENCE A FAITH BASED EXPERIENCE AS WELL. REALLY BECAUSE IT PROVIDES A SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL FOUNDATION THAT KIDS NEED NOT JUST TO BE SUCCESSFUL THROUGHOUT THEIR EDUCATIONAL YEARS BUT REALLY THE FOUNDATIONAL ELEMENTS THAT ARE SO IMPORTANT THROUGHOUT LIFE. MOM PASSED AWAY IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN FROM PANCREATIC CANCER. AND I THEN TOOK OVER HER ROLE AS CEO OF THAT NONPROFIT PRESCHOOL SO FROM A MOTHER'S PERSPECTIVE FROM A LONG TIME ADVOCATE FOR EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION. AND THEN TO A PRESCHOOL PROVIDER WHO SAW EVERY SINGLE DAY HOW ACCESS TO THOSE SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL SKILLS ARE SO VITAL TO OUR AN UNDERPRIVILEGED. TO THE STUDENTS WHO WE WOULD TAKE ON THAT WERE IN FOSTER CARE THAT WERE HOMELESS THAT HAD- DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND TRAUMA HAPPENING IN THEIR LIFE AT HOME. THESE EXPERIENCES GIVE THEM THE SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL BALANCE THAT THEY NEED IN THEIR LIFE IT HAS BEEN AN HONOR TO SEE THAT AND TO SEE. THAT WE'RE EXPANDING THAT. FOR ALL FOUR YEAR OLDS AND LASTLY WE DON'T DO ENOUGH WHAT I'M SO EXCITED ABOUT IN THIS EXPANSION OF T. K. IS THAT WE DON'T DO ENOUGH FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS. WE TALK ABOUT THE MIDDLE CLASS ALL THE TIME BUT SO MANY FAMILIES SO MANY MIDDLE CLASS WORKING CLASS FAMILIES MAKE TOO MUCH MONEY TO AFFORD SUBSIDIZED PRESCHOOL CHILD CARE. BUT DON'T MAKE IT MONEY TO TAKE THAT OPPORTUNITY AND GIVE THOSE TO THEIR CHILDREN THE OPPORTUNITY FOR EARLY LEARNING EXPERIENCE THIS IS WHAT THAT BILL DOES I'M EXCITED. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY TWO THANK YOU THANK YOU WITHOUT ESTAS WALDRON YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I TO RISE AS A PROUD JOIN AUTHOR OF THIS MEASURE AND I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE FROM SACRAMENTO.

OPPORTUNITY TO ENSURE OUR STATE'S YOUNGEST STUDENTS ARE BETTER PREPARED TO SUCCEED BOTH IN THEIR FUTURE SCHOOLING AS WELL AS IN LIFE. AND A STUDY IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN FOUND THAT TRADITIONAL KINDERGARTEN GAVE OUR YOUNGEST STUDENTS AT SIGNIFICANT LEARNING ADVANTAGE. BUT WE KNOW THAT ONLY 31% OF LOW INCOME FOUR YEAR OLDS- ARE NOT 31% OF LOW INCOME FOUR YEAR OLDS ARE NOT SERVED IN ANY EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION PROGRAM. AND IT AS WAS STATED ONLY 33% OF CHILDREN UNDER FIVE WHO QUALIFY FOR EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION ARE ACTUALLY SIR WE CAN DO A BETTER JOB FOR EQUITY AND ACCESS- FOR EDUCATION FOR OUR CHILDREN I URGE AND I VOTE ON THIS VERY IMPORTANT MEASURE.

CAUSING OUR MUNICIPAL IN OUR WEIGHT PAYER RATE PAYERS. TO HAVE TO DEAL BECAUSE- OF THOSE- THOSE LANDFILLS. GOING BEYOND. AND HAVING TO A HAVING TO THAT MUCH. FURTHER IN FOR AWAY. FROM WHERE PEOPLE ARE USING IT. UP BUYING NOT REALIZE THAT THAT. THAT TEN THAT WIDGET THAT TOY COULD ALSO COME WITH A SEA OF PLASTIC. AND ALL OF THIS IS A NECESSARY OR MOST OF IT IS UNNECESSARY BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT WE ALSO HAVE. MEANT MATERIALS THAT ARE ALTERNATIVE MATERIALS THAT ARE SUSTAINABLE AND THAT ARE RECYCLABLE AND IN FACT MANY OF OUR ONLINE SHOPPERS ARE ALREADY TRANSFER ARE TRANSFORMING TO USING THOSE MATERIALS. I BY CLOTHING ONLINE SOMETIMES IT'S VERY RARE NOW THAT THAT CLOTHING COMES WRAPPED IN PLASTIC. NOW THEY COME IN A RECYCLE GARMENT BAGS BUT SOME OF OUR LARGEST ONLINE RETAILERS ARE USING ALL KINDS OF ALTERNATIVES THAT ARE MORE SUSTAINABLE. THIS BILL SIMPLY SAYS THAT BY A DATE CERTAIN WITHIN A FEW YEARS ON LARGE ONLINE RETAILERS WILL HAVE TO USE RECYCLABLE PACKING MATERIAL AND CAN NO LONGER USE THE NON RECYCLABLE MATERIALS. THAT RIGHT NOW WE'RE FILLING UP OUR LANDFILLS. NOW MEMBERS I WILL ADMIT TO YOU THAT THIS BILL IS A WORK IN PROGRESS.

AT A FASTER RATE THAN THEY'RE ALREADY DOING BUT BELIEVE ME THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS ALREADY HAPPENING IN THE MARKET PLACE AND THAT IS DOABLE.

WHEN I WROTE THE BILL I MADE SURE TO EXEMPT OUT CERTAIN SPECIALTY RETAILERS WHERE I KNEW THIS WOULD BE A HARDSHIP. WE ARE LOOKING AT LANGUAGE NOW TO EXEMPT OUT PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS THAT NEED TO BE KEPT AT A AT A CONTROLLED TEMPERATURE. TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS ACHIEVABLE FOR EVERYBODY THAT'S THE GOAL IS NOT TO BE PUNITIVE. IT'S NOT TO STOP ONLINE RETAIL. WHAT THE COUNTRY IT'S TO ALLOW THE GROWTH OF ONLINE RETAIL BUT THE WAY THAT PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA EXPECT WHICH IS IN A WAY THAT IS SUSTAINABLE. AND THAT LEAVES THE COUNTRY. IN IN TERMS OF BEING RECYCLABLE.
