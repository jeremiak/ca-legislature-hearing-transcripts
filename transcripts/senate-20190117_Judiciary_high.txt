WADE DECISION HAS BEEN A CORNERSTONE IN THE WOMEN'S EQUALITY MOVEMENT AND IT'S HELPED ADVANCE. THEIR ABILITY TO PARTICIPATE FULLY IN THE SOCIAL POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC LIFE OF OUR STATE AND COUNTRY. TODAY NATIONAL PEER REVIEWED STUDIES SHOW THAT ABORTION IS A SAFE PROCEDURE THAT ONE IN FOUR WOMEN IN THE UNITED STATES WILL ACCESS. DESPITE THE SAFETY IN DEMAND FOR ABORTION SIR BEING OVERTURN FURTHER A ROAD DUE TO THE FACT THAT SOME STATES CONTINUE TO PASS LEGISLATION THAT CREATES BARRIERS TO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH. FOR WOMEN AND RECENT APPOINTMENTS TO THE US SUPREME COURT ARE LIKELY NOT TO BE SUPPORTIVE OF WOMEN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE. IT IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO CALIFORNIA STANDS IN STRONG SUPPORT OF ROE V. WADE AND AS SUCH SR SEVEN VALIDATES THAT THE STATE CAN STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IS COMMITTED TO PROTECTING AND ADVANCING ACCESS TO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH.

FOR PEOPLE TO CONTROL THEIR OWN BODIES AND THE RATES AND ACCESS HAVE IN FACT BEEN ERODED. IT'S BEEN FORTY SIX YEARS THAT WE CONTINUE TO FIGHT NOT JUST FOR ACCESS TO THE HEALTHCARE SERVICES.

IN I BELIEVE THERE'S ALWAYS MERIT IN SPEAKING TRUTH TO POWER. YOU HAVE THE POWER. AND WE ALL KNOW. IN THE U. S. SIXTY MILLION LIVES HAVE BEEN KILLED BY ABORTION. SIXTY MILLION HUMAN LIVES CAN BE REPRESENTED BY THE TOTAL NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO CURRENTLY LIVE IN CALIFORNIA WASHINGTON OREGON NEVADA AND ARIZONA. ABORTION IS A BRUTAL BLOODY BARBARIC AND INHUMANE. THE MILLIONS OF WOMEN FOR A LIFETIME LEAVING MANY OF US TO SUFFER FROM DEPRESSION ANXIETY PANIC ATTACKS NIGHTMARES. DRUG AND ALCOHOL ADDICTIONS AND THOUGHTS OF SUICIDE. ESPECIALLY WOMEN MY AGE WHO WERE LIED TO BY THE ABORTION INDUSTRY TELLING US IT WAS JUST A CLUMP OF CELLS. YEAH WE KNOW THE TRUTH EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM HAS HEARD THE BABY'S HEARTBEAT ON AN ULTRASOUND HAS SEEN THE ARMS AND LEGS. HAS SEEN. THE FACE UNDENIABLY HUMAN. SR SEVENTY VALUES HUMAN LIFE IT IS A CIVIL RIGHTS AND JUSTICE IT'S DOCTOR MARTIN LUTHER KING JUNIOR FAMOUSLY SAID. INJUSTICE ANYWHERE IS A THREAT TO JUSTICE EVERYWHERE. WHATEVER AFFECTS ONE DIRECTLY. AFFECTS ALL OF US INDIRECTLY. KILLING THE MOST VULNERABLE AMONG US THE WEEK THE VOICELESS THEM PERFECT ENDING AND WANTED. IS A LETHAL HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATION. ALL OF THIS BABY GIRLS ARE BEING KILLED JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE FEMALE. 90% OF BABIES IDENTIFIED AS HAVING DOWN SYNDROME ARE KILLED. POOR BABIES AND BABIES OF COLOR BEING KILLED AT DISPROPORTIONATE RATES. WE DON'T SOLVE POVERTY BY PORT. I INVITE YOU TO SPEND SOME TIME WITH ME AT THE SIDEWALK IN FRONT OF THESE ABORTION BUSINESSES. MOST WOMEN I MEET FEEL THAT THEY HAVE NO CHOICE. TOMORROW TWENTY BABIES WILL BE KILLED AT THE FOR PROFIT FAMILY PLANNING ASSOCIATES HERE IN CAL AND SACRAMENTO. ALL BE THERE IN THE RAIN IN THE WIND. WITH A SIGN THAT SAYS PREGNANT NEED HELP WITH THE HEART WILLING TO DO ANYTHING TO HELP THESE WOMEN AND TO SAVE LIVES. WOMEN COMING OUT AFTERWARDS ARE CHANGED FOREVER. OFTEN IN SO MUCH PAIN THEY CAN BARELY. GET TO THEIR CARS SOMETIMES BLEEDING THROUGH THEIR PANTS AS THEY PASSED BLOOD CLOTS LARGER THAN THE SIZE OF LEMONS. OR FALL TO THEIR KNEES THEY KEEP. GIVING YOU A LITTLE EXTRA TIME THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WITNESS -- MY NAME IS GREG BURKSWITH. WOULD YOU MOVE THE MIKE FOALE ACROSS. MY NAME'S -- GREG BIRCH WITH THE CALIFORNIA FAMILY COUNCIL. AND ON HERE -- TO ALSO TO POSE A THREAT CONTINUE READING HER SPEECH BECAUSE IT WAS SO WELL WRITTEN AND I WAS SENT TO THIS MORNING I WAS SO IMPRESSED SO. I'LL KEEP GOING HERE. I HAVE A DREAM WHEN WOMEN CAN SUCCEED WITH THAT WITHOUT HAVING TO KILL THEIR CHILDREN. I HAVE A DREAM WHERE WE CAN ALL WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE SURE THAT WOMEN HAVE THE RESOURCES AND SUPPORT THEY NEED ONES FACING CHALLENGES OF AN UNEXPECTED PREGNANCY. FOR THAT BOY ABORTION BECOMES UNTHINKABLE. I INVITE YOU TO SHARE THAT DREAM pOF CALIFORNIANS TO REJECT ABORTION. ABORTION RATE IN CALIFORNIA IS AT A HISTORIC LOW WITH A 48% DECLINE IN CALIFORNIA ABORTION RATES SINCE. NINETEEN NINETY ONE COME BE ON A POSITIVE LOVING LIFE AFFIRMING PRO LIFE PRO WOMAN PRO SCIENCE SIDE OF HISTORY. YES I KNOW YOU'RE VOTING RECORD YES I KNOW YOUR DEMOCRATIC PARTY LEGIONS TO THE ABORTION INDUSTRY. YET IN LOVE AND CHARITY I HOPE THAT SOME DAY EACH OF YOU WILL HAVE A CHANGE OF HEART. JUST LIKE JEAN ROW OF ROE VERSUS WADE HER REAL NAME IS NORMA MCCORVEY WHO ACTUALLY NEVER HAD AN ABORTION AND LATER HAD A COMPLETE CHANGE OF HEART BECOMING A PRO LIFE LEADER. LATER IN LIFE ALONGSIDE FORMER ABORTIONISTS IN NY RLPH FOUNDER DR BERNARD NATHANSON WHO HAD DONE OVER AT SIXTY THOUSAND ABORTIONS IN HIS LIFETIME. BUT LATER BECAME A PRO LIFE. IN PRODUCER OF THE SILENT SCREEN. THERE IS HOPE AND FORGIVENESS FOR MERCY. IN CLOSING. DR MARTIN LUTHER KING JUNIOR SAID THAT OUR LIVES BEGIN TO END THE DAY WE BECOME SILENT ABOUT THE THINGS THAT MATTER. TODAY DESPITE THE POWERS AGAINST ME I WILL NOT BE SILENT ABOUT THE MATTER OF ABORTION WHICH DOCTOR BERNARD NATHANSON CALLED THE MOST ATROCIOUS WHOLE COST IN THE HISTORY OF THE UNITED TATES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH [inaudible] ANY OTHER. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION PLEASE COME FOR WITH YOUR NAME AND AFFILIATION. SEEING AND HEARING NONE WE WILL BRING THIS BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR COMMENT TO I WILL START -- AND I WILL TELL YOU I'M HONORED AND PROUD TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THIS RESOLUTION. THE RIGHT OF WOMEN TO CONTROL OUR REPRODUCTION. IS ABOUT. THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT I CAN THINK OF THAT WOMEN HAVE. AND UNFORTUNATELY IN NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE I WAS. AN ADULT AT THAT POINT IN TIME I HAD SEEN FRIENDS OF MINE. GO DOWN TO MEXICO BECAUSE THEY COULD NOT HAVE LEGAL ABORTIONS IN THIS COUNTRY. COMING BACK. SOME OF THEM -- IS SEVERELY DAMAGED BY THESE. PROCEDURES. AND YET DESPERATE TO BE ABLE TO LIVE THEIR LIVES AS THEY CHOSE. SO I APPRECIATE THAT THERE IS A STRONG -- ELEMENT THAT DOESN'T BELIEVE THAT WOMEN SHOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE THAT CHOICE. HERE IN CALIFORNIA IT IS AMONG OUR MOST FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS. IT'S BECOME THE SENATE TRADITION TO MARK THIS ANNUAL EVENT. IS WELL WE SHOULD AS IT IS ROOTED IN OUR NATION'S CONSTITUTION THAT A WOMAN HAS A RIGHT TO CONTROL HER OWN BODY AND MAKE HER OWN CHOICES. AND IN CONSULTATION WITH HER FAMILY OR HER WHOM EVER SHE CHOOSES. YOU REFERENCE THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. I GREW UP IN A REPUBLICAN HOUSEHOLD BACK IN THE AREA OF MASSACHUSETTS. NELSON ROCKEFELLER WAS ONE OF MY HEROES GROWING UP. AND I REMEMBER MY PARENTS SAYING WHAT POSSIBLE RIGHT IS IT OF THE GOVERNMENT TO TELL A WOMAN WHAT SHE SHOULD DO WITH HER BODY. AND I THINK THAT'S A FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE THAT HAS SURE HOPEFULLY. SHOULD SURVIVE TO THE REPUBLICAN PARTY NOTION THAT GOVERNMENT SHOULD NOT BE INTERFERING IN PEOPLE'S LIVES ANYMORE THAN NECESSARY. AND CERTAINLY TO INTERFERE IN THAT MOST BASIC FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT. OF WHEN WITH WHOM AND WHETHER TO HAVE A FAMILY. IS AMONG THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS THAT WE HAVE. SO THIS IS A QUESTION OF EQUALITY FOR MANY OF US. BY -- TAKE UMBRAGE IN SOME OF THE CHARACTERIZATIONS BUT THIS IS A BATTLE WE'VE BEEN HAVING FOR DECADES AND I'M NOT GOING. TO GET DOWN IN THE MUD ON IT AGAIN -- THE TWO USED MARTIN LUTHER KING AS YOUR REFERENCE I THINK -- THIS MARCHES HIS GOOD REPUTATION AND THE THINGS THAT HE STOOD FOR WHICH WERE EQUALITY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL -- BUT IT IS DEEPLY IRONIC THAT THOSE WHO CONDEMN DEMOCRATS FOR SUPPORTING THIS -- CLAIMING THAT THIS IS. A VALUE OUT OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY I WOULD SUBMIT TO YOU THAT IT IS TOTALLY CONTRARY. TO THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES AT LEAST OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY I GREW UP IN. BUT THIS ISN'T A PARTY ISSUE THIS IS A HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUE. THIS IS A WOMEN'S RIGHTS ISSUE. AND WITH THAT -- I WILL. ENTERTAIN ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FOR MOTION AND THEN WE WILL HAVE YOU CLOSE. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS SENATOR CUMBIA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MADAM CHAIR APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE A FEW COMMENTS I'M OBVIOUSLY. GOING TO SUPPORT THIS I'M A CO AUTHOR AND I'M PROUD TO BE CO AUTHOR I THINK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY THIS IS WHAT THE COMMITTEE HEARINGS ARE ALL ABOUT -- THE ABILITY TO DISAGREE ON ON ISSUES OUT AND I WANT THE PRE SHEET THE COMMENTS THAT YOU MADE -- MY MOTHER WAS A NURSE AND SHE WORKED IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM. AND I WAS BORN INTO A FAMILY OF DEMOCRATS THAT. GO BLUE A LONG WAIT BUT MY MOTHER WAS VERY CLEAR ABOUT WHAT SHE'D SEEN ON AND THE KIND OF OF CARNAGE SHE HAD SEEN WOMEN THAT FELT LIKE THEY HAD NO CHOICE. AND AND SHE INSTILL THOSE VALUES IN ME. AND I FEEL. LIKE THERE'S NOTHING MORE IMPORTANT IS THE ABILITY TO DECIDE HOW BIG YOUR FAMILY SHOULD BE IN AND WHO YOU WANT TO HAVE CHILDREN WITH. AND PROTECTING THAT RIGHT IS IS REALLY A MANAGER THANK YOU. ANY OTHER COMMENTS QUESTIONS IS OUR MOTION. DID YOU WANT TO I'M SORRY SENATOR AWFUL SO THE MOVE BY SENATOR UMBERG. SENATOR LABOR WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS THERE MANY THINGS I COULD SAY IN RESPONSE BUT I THINK THE ONLY THING THAT I WANT TO CLARIFY IS THAT MOST OF US KNOW THERE IS NO ABORTION INDUSTRY. IT IS PART OF REPRODUCTIVE CARE AND YOU CANNOT DIAL 1-800- AND FIND SOME PLACE TO GO AND HAVE AN ABORTION SO I JUST ALWAYS LIKE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CLARIFY THAT. AND I WOULD ALSO JUST LIKE TO SAY THAT THIS IS ABOUT A WOMAN'S FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO CHOOSE I'VE NEVER KNOWN ANY WOMAN WHO'S HAD AN ABORTION WHO SKIPPED INTO THE CLINIC AND WAS EXCITED. IT WAS A HARD DECISION BUT IS A DECISION SHE HAD TO MAKE AND WAS USUALLY CONFRONTED WITH PEOPLE OUTSIDE WHO MADE HER FEEL EVEN WORSE. SO MADAM CHAIR I THINK YOU CAN FOR YOUR COMMENTS CHAIR MEMBERS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AND I VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ALL DEBATE HAVING CONCLUDED. THE MOTION IS TO PASS. I'M SORRY THE MOTION IS THAT THE RESOLUTION BE ADOPTED AND WITH THAT PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. SENT BY FAX AND I AM FORGES GO. TO ALLEN. ALLEN I COVER EURO. COVER EURO I WANTING. MONEY I STERN.
