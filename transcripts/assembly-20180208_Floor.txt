CAN I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION PLEASE MEMBERS PLEASE GIVE YOUR ATTENTION TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER AMONG YOUR RECOGNIZE. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER TODAY CALIFORNIANS FROM NON COASTAL CITIES AND COASTAL CITIES. BOTH REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS HAVE GATHERED HERE IN SACRAMENTO TO COLLECTIVELY VOICE THEIR OPPOSITION TO THE PROPOSED EXPANSION OF OFFSHORE OIL DRILLING BY THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION. TODAY THE LEGISLATURE WILL JOIN A GROWING MULTITUDE OF VOICES SPEAKING OUT AGAINST THE SHORT SIGHTED PROPOSAL. THIS BIPARTISAN ASSEMBLY JOINT RESOLUTION EXPRESSES THE LEGISLATURE STRONG AND UNEQUIVOCAL OPPOSITION TO THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION'S DRAFT LAND TO OPEN UP. ALL THREE REGIONS OF THE CALIFORNIA COAST TO OFFSHORE OIL AND GAS LEASING WHICH HAVE BEEN OFF LIMITS FOR OVER THREE DECADES. CALIFORNIA KNOWS THE COST OF OFFSHORE OIL DRILLING. FROM THE LARGEST SPILL IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY TAKING PLACE IN NINETEEN SIXTY NINE IN SANTA BARBARA TO THE MOST RECENT REFER TO FUEL OIL SPILL. SO MANY COMMUNITIES HAVE PAID THE PRICE. ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL OCEAN ECONOMIC PROGRAM CALIFORNIA'S COASTAL ECONOMY EMPLOYEES. FIFTEEN POINT EIGHT MILLION PEOPLE. GENERATES APPROXIMATELY TWO POINT ONE TRILLION AND CREATES AN ESTIMATED EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT OF CALIFORNIA'S GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT. THE THREAT AND REALITY OF OIL SPILLS IMPACTING ALL CALIFORNIANS EXPLAINS WHY. THE CONCERN TO EXPAND OFFSHORE OIL DRILLING IS SO STRONG IN THE STATE. A RECENT PP I SEE STUDY FOUND THAT AN OVERWHELMING SIXTY NINE PERCENT OF CALIFORNIANS OPPOSED ADDITIONAL OFFSHORE OIL DRILLING. CALIFORNIANS ARE PROUD OF OUR COMMITMENT TO CLEAN AND RENEWABLE ENERGY AND THE PROPOSED DECISION BY THE PRESIDENT AND HIS ADMINISTRATION IS AN AFFRONT TO OUR VALUES AND A THREAT TO OUR STATE WIDE ECONOMY. I RESPECTFULLY ASPIRIN AYE VOTES. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLOOM YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AND I WANNA THANK OUR COLLEAGUE FROM SANTA BARBARA FROM A UPBRINGING THIS AJ ARE FORWARD MEMBER SINCE NINETEEN SIXTY NINE FORTY FOUR OIL SPILLS OF OVER FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND GALLONS. HAVE OCCURRED IN THE UNITED STATES. THAT INCLUDES A ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX THOUSAND GALLON SPILL IN SANTA BARBARA AND TWENTY FIFTEEN. SIXTY THOUSAND GALLONS IN SAN FRANCISCO IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN. FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND GALLONS IN HUNTINGTON BEACH IN NINETEEN NINETY. AND FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND IN MARTINEZ IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT AND LET'S NOT FORGET THE NINETEEN SIXTY NINE SANTA BARBARA OIL SPILL THE NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE EXXON VALDEZ SPILL. AND MOST RECENTLY THE TWENTY TEN DEEPWATER HORIZON SPILL THAT SHOWED US THIS YEAR DESTRUCTIVE POWER THAT OIL AND GAS EXTRACTION CAN BRING. THE CALIFORNIA COAST IS MORE THAN JUST A PLACE WHERE THE LAND MEETS THE PACIFIC OCEAN IT. HOUSES HABITATS TEEMING WITH MARINE LIFE IT SUPPORTS TOURISM AND RECREATIONAL ACTIVITIES IT IS ONE OF OUR MOST MAJESTIC RESOURCES AND IT'S AVAILABLE TO EVERYONE. JUST THINK OF HOW MANY PEOPLE FROM COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE ENJOY OUR COASTAL AREAS. AND THIS DEMANDS CONSTANT VIGILANCE AND POLICIES THAT EMBODY A SPIRIT OF RESPONSIBLE ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP. UNFORTUNATELY THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION DOESN'T SEE IT THAT WAY AND IS WILLING TO PUT ALL OF THAT AT RISK IN SPITE OF. DECADES OF SPEAKING OUT ON THIS ISSUE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND PARENTHETICALLY THE ADMINISTRATION HAS ALSO CONTEMPLATING REDUCING ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTIONS ELSEWHERE SUCH AS THE MOJAVE DESERT. CALIFORNIA NOT A PLAYGROUND. AND THIS IS NOT A GAME. OUR RESOURCES IN OUR COMMUNITIES ARE RISK. AND MUST BE PROTECTED AJ ARE TWENTY NINE IS OUR STATEMENT TO THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. NOT HERE. NOT NOW NOT EVER. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD. MADAM SPEAKER AND MEMBERS. I REPRESENT MORE COASTLINE IN ANY OTHER ASSEMBLY DISTRICT IN CALIFORNIA. MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED MILES. OUR COASTLINE IS RUGGED MAJESTIC PRISTINE AND IT NEEDS TO STAY THAT WAY. OUR CONNIE RELIES ON THIS EXTRAORDINARY COAST LINE TO PROVIDE A HEALTHY COMMERCIAL FISHING INDUSTRY. IT BRINGS TOURISTS AND PROVIDES RECREATION OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS IN OUR COASTAL CITIES DEPEND UPON THIS. CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN ABLE TO PROTECT ITS COASTLINE FROM NEW DRILLING FOR DECADES. WE ALREADY UNDERSTAND ACCEPT THE TRUTH OF CLIMATE CHANGE WE'VE BEEN A LEADER IN TRANSITIONING AWAY FROM FOSSIL FUELS. REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND PROVIDING INCENTIVES FOR ALTERNATIVE ENERGY SOURCES. WE KNOW IT'S POSSIBLE. PRACTICAL IS CREATED ANEW AND THRIVING ECONOMY. THERE WAS NO REASON TO GO BACK IN TIME. SINCE THE MID EIGHTIES THERE HAVE BEEN MORE THAN SIX HUNDRED OIL AND GAS PIPELINE SPILLS EXPLOSIONS AND INCIDENTS CAUSING MORE THAN SEVEN HUNDREDFIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN DAMAGES. TWO HUNDRED INJURY INJURIES IN NEARLY FIFTY DEATHS. IT'S NOT JUST THE OIL RIGS IF THE PIPELINES SHIPS. THE TRANSFER OIL FROM SEA TO SHORT THAT CAN CAUSE DAMAGE. TO IGNORE THE ENVIRONMENTAL DEVASTATION DONE BY OIL SPILLS AND DISMISS THE CRITICAL IMPORTANCE OF WORKING TOWARDS INDEPENDENCE FROM FOSSIL FUELS. IS IRRESPONSIBLE AND WE MUST FIGHT BACK I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER BAKER YOUR RECOGNIZE. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS. I RISE IN SUPPORT OF HR TWENTY NINE AS A PROUD CO AUTHOR AND I THINK THE MEMBER FROM SAN SANTA BARBARA FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. BECAUSE OUR COASTLINES DESERVE. TO BE PROTECTED THEY DESERVE NO PARTISAN POLITICS. AND NO GAMES WHEN IT COMES TO. JURY WE HAVE BEAUTIFUL COASTLINES NOT ONLY NOW BUT FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS. NOW THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION GAVE AN EXEMPTION. TO FLORIDA. SAYING THAT FLORIDA WAS. TO ESSENTIAL THEIR COASTLINES FOR OUR NAKED OUR ECONOMIC VITALITY. SO I THE MESSAGE FOR THE ADMINISTRATION FOR OTHERS YOU CONSIDERING EXPAND INTO NEW LEASES OFF CALIFORNIA'S COAST. WEIRD TEN TIMES BETTER THAN FLORIDA. CALIFORNIA'S EIGHT HUNDRED AND FORTY MILES OF COASTLINE WITH FIVE OF CALIFORNIA'S MOST POPULOUS COUNTIES BORDERING THE PACIFIC OCEAN. THE COASTAL ECONOMY IN CALIFORNIA CREATE SIX HUNDRED AND SIXTY TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN WAGES AND ONE POINT SEVEN TRILLION. IN THE GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT THAT'S CALIFORNIA'S COASTLINE. NEARLY FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND CALIFORNIA JOBS ARE DEPENDENT ON OCEAN RELATED ACTIVITIES. THE TOGETHER CONTRIBUTE FOURTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS TO OUR ECONOMY. IN ADDITION THERE'S ALL THE FISHERIES AND RECREATION THAT IS INCLUDED IN THE ECONOMY. CALIFORNIA'S COMMERCIAL AND RECREATIONAL FISHING INDUSTRY FEEDS PEOPLE FROM AROUND THE WORLD. SUPPORTING MORE THAN A HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND JOBS AND GENERATING OVER SIX BILLION DOLLARS IN ECONOMIC ACTIVITY. THIS IS WORTH PROTECTING. IN ADDITION. YOU CAN ALSO SEE BEAUTIFUL ECOLOGICAL DIVERSITY ARE BEAUTIFUL ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY FROM OUR COASTLINES AND OTHERWISE. NOW. I'VE I'VE HEARD THE ARGUMENT AND IT'S IMPORTANT ONE THAT WE NEED TO HAVE OIL ENERGY INDEPENDENCE. WE DO. BUT CALIFORNIA. pCOASTLINES ARE NOT GOING TO MAKE US INDEPENDENT FROM OTHER COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD. CALIFORNIA'S. COASTLINE ALREADY CONTRIBUTES TO OUR OIL INDEPENDENCE. AND IN THE UNITED STATES JUST THIS WEEK. THERE WAS A REPORT THAT CAME OUT THAT SHOWED DOMESTIC PRODUCTION OF OIL IS SURGING. THIS YEAR WE WILL HAVE A HIGHER AVERAGE DOMESTIC OIL PRODUCTION THAN ANYTIME IN HISTORY IN OUR COUNTRY. SO WE DON'T NEED TO EXPAND TO A NEW LEASES IN ORDER TO HAVE ECONOMIC INDEPENDENCE OR TO HAVE OIL INDEPENDENCE WE NEED TO PROTECT OUR COASTLINES. AND FINALLY IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE JUST HOW BIPARTISAN SUPPORT FOR A COURSE COAST LINES HAVE BEEN FOR DECADES IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR. THIS BODY. THIS STATE. DECIDED IT WAS IMPORTANT HAVE A MORATORIUM ON ANY NEW LEASES ON STATE PLANS OFF THE COAST. THAT WAS A BILL SIGNED BY A REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR PASSED WITH REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRATIC VOTES. THAT'S WHICH IT HAPPENED TODAY. WE DO NOT NEED TO EXPAND. NEW LEASES OFFER CALIFORNIA COASTS. AND TO THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION I SAY LISTEN TO US. LISTEN TO THE ECONOMIC CONTRIBUTION THAT WE ARE MAKING LISTEN TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONTRIBUTION THAT WE ARE MAKING. NOTICE THAT WE ARE MUCH BETTER THAN FLORIDA WHEN IT COMES TO DESERVING COASTLINE PROTECTION. AND WE GOT THIS IN CALIFORNIA WE'VE TAKING CARE OF OUR COASTS LEAVE THEM ALONE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK AYE VOTE. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER VOEPEL. I RESPECTFULLY STAND TO WIN OPPOSING THIS AJ ARE. FEBRUARY NINETEEN SIXTY NINE. EIGHTY THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND BARRELS WERE SPILLED IN SANTA BARBARA. TRAGICALLY IN TWENTY FIFTEEN A HUNDRED AND FORTY THREE THOUSAND BARRELS. WE'RE SPILLED OFF THE COAST. AND. DOZENS OF CRIMINAL CHARGES RESULTED SO YES THERE IS A RISK. THAT PARTICULAR COMPANY. WHO HAS SINCE GONE BANKRUPT? SIMPLY DID NOT SERVICE THE PIPELINES DID NOT REPAIR THEM. SO. HEAVY. OVERLOOKED HEAVY REGULATION IS% THE ORDER OF THE DAY IF THERE'S ANY. DRILLING OFF THE CALIFORNIA COAST I'M THERE. NOW. EVERY TWELVE MONTHS EIGHTY SIX THOUSAND BARRELS OF OIL. SEE BUT OUT OF THE SEA BED OFF OF SANTA BARBARA IN THAT PARTICULAR AREA NATURALLY. THROUGH THE SEA BED. DRILLING WOULD HELP ALLEVIATE THE INCREDIBLE PRESSURE AND THE CP. THAT WOULD HELP. ALSO. UNITED STATES IS NUMBER TEN IMPROVING OIL RESERVES AND WITH FRACKING AN OFFSHORE OIL WE CAN BE A NET EXPORTER. NOT ONLY BECOMING ENERGY SELF SUFICIENT BUT MAKING MONEY OFF OF IT. WE'RE NUMBER FIVE FOR NATURAL GAS WHEN YOU DRILL YOU GET A LOT OF NATURAL GAS RIGHT NOW THE UNITED STATES IS REVERSING OUR NATURAL GAS COMPRESSION PLANTS. FROM IMPORT. TO COMPRESS INTO TO EXPORT. THAT'S VERY GOOD ECONOMIC NEWS. THE U. S. NEEDS TO BE SELF SUFFICIENT. AND WE CAN SAFELY ENVIRONMENTALLY. SAFELY. DO IT WITH MODERN TECHNOLOGY SO. MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS IN THE ASSEMBLY. I CAN'T SUPPORT THIS BILL I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY YOU WANT IT. MAINLY BECAUSE YOU CAN'T TRUST SOME OF THE POWERS THAT ARE ABOVE CALIFORNIA I GOT IT. BUT. I WOULD LIKE TO ENCOURAGE US. TO TIGHTEN UP. ALL OF THE REGULATIONS ON DRILLING OF ANY KIND INCLUDING FRACKING. AND. THAT WILL SATISFY UP WHERE IF. THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION DOES TRY TO FORCE THIS UPON CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE A DEFENSIVE FALL BACK THAT IS. PALATABLE HOPEFULLY TO A MAJORITY IN THIS ROOM THANK YOU VERY MUCH THAT'S MY TWO CENTS. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER GLORIA YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER I RISE TODAY IS A PROUD JOINT AUTHOR OF ASSEMBLY JOINT RESOLUTION TWENTY NINE. CALIFORNIA'S COASTAL MARINE WATERS ARE OUR STATE'S MOST PRECIOUS RESOURCES IN THIS RESOLUTION SIGNALS TO CONGRESS THAT WE ARE PAYING ATTENTION. THAT WE WILL NOT BE PASSIVE OBSERVERS THE PRESIDENT'S ATTEMPTS TO PUT OUR ENVIRONMENT IN JEOPARDY. NOW SPEAKER I JOIN HUNDREDS OF SAN DIEGANS THIS PAST SATURDAY ON MISSION BEACH IN MY ASSEMBLY DISTRICT TO PROTEST THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL. HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE COMING OUT MOTIVATED TO SEND A SIGNAL TO WASHINGTON ABOUT HOW OPPOSE THEY ARE TO THIS EFFORT. NOW KNOW THAT I THINK IT'S FAIRLY CYNICAL THAT THERE WAS ONLY ONE PUBLIC HEARING TO TAKE THE COMMENTS OF CALIFORNIANS ARE ON THIS PROPOSAL IN OUR ENTIRE STATE TAPPING LATER TODAY. RIGHT HERE IN SACRAMENTO WHAT'S NOT ACCESSIBLE TO MY CONSTITUENTS AND THAT'S WHY THEY RALLIED ON MISSION BEACH THIS SATURDAY NECK COUNTY AND ALL OF US TO RAISE OUR COLLECTIVE VOICE IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE HEARD. AT THE ONE AND ONLY TIME WHEN INITIATION CARE TO LISTEN TO THEM ON THIS MOST IMPORTANT OF PROPOSALS. IS BESET BY MY COLLEAGUES ON BOTH SIDES THE I'LL WHY THIS IS SUCH A TERRIBLE IDEA BUT IT BEARS REPEATING THAT THIS PARTICULAR EFFORT. UNDERMINES OUR EFFORTS TO MOVE TO RENEWABLE ENERGY. THAT THIS A. DENIES THE SCIENCE OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND MOST IMPORTANTLY THIS PROPOSAL IS AT ODDS WITH WHAT THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA WANT WHICH IS TO PROTECT OUR COASTLINES AND ATTACKED OUR ENVIRONMENT. SO AGAIN I STRONGLY URGE AN AYE VOTE ON THIS MEASURE I THINK THAT THE. MEMBER FROM SANTA BARBARA FOR HER LEADERSHIP. THIS IS IMPORTANT BUT STAND UP LET'S BE COUNTED AND LET'S GIVE A VOICE TO OUR CONSTITUENTS WHO'VE BEEN SHUT OUT BY THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER MURATSUCHI. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER. I RISE ALSO AS A. A PROUD JOINT AUTHOR OF THIS RESOLUTION WANT TO JOIN ALL OF MY COSTA COLLEAGUES. INFORMING THIS A COASTAL WALL OF RESISTANCE TO NEW OFFSHORE OIL DRILLING I WOULD ESPECIALLY WANT TO GIVE AT THANKS TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN RAMON. FOR US BE IS STANDING UP AND SPEAKING UP AND SHOWING THAT THIS IS IN FACT A BIPARTISAN. RESOLUTION THAT THAT. IS SUPPORTED BY DEMOCRATS REPUBLICANS INDEPENDENTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. JUST IN MY DISTRICT FROM MEN AND BEACH DOWN THROUGH PALACE VERDES WE HAD A OUR OIL DRILLING PROPOSAL IN TWENTY FIFTEEN. IN HERMOSA BEACH WHERE OVER EIGHTY PERCENT OF HERMOSA BEACH CITIZENS. VOTED AGAINST. NEW OIL DRILLING IN THEIR COMMUNITY. YOU DON'T GET TO THOSE KIND OF NUMBERS EIGHTY PERCENT. WITHOUT BIPARTISAN SUPPORT IN THE FACT THAT. THAT THE OPPOSITION WAS SUPPORTED BY THE NEIGHBORING COMMUNITIES I INCLUDING MANHATTAN BEACH AND REDONDO BEACH SO. I THINK IT'S CLEAR THAT. CALIFORNIANS OF ALL PARTIES OF ALL PARTISAN BACKGROUNDS. SUPPORT THIS RESOLUTION SUPPORT. RESISTING ANY NEW OFFSHORE DRILLING WE ARE CALIFORNIA AND WE WILL FIGHT BACK. TO PROTECT OUR BEAUTIFUL COATS. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER CALDERON YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER MEMBERS WHEN I WAS FIRST ELECTED TO SAY LEGISLATURE I CAME AND I AND I CHAIRED THE COMMITTEE ON ARTS ENTERTAINMENT SPORTS TOURISM. AND INTERNET MEDIA AND SO I'M NOT GONNA REITERATE ALL THE FACTS AND ALL THE NUMBERS HAVE BEEN. EXPRESS ALREADY BY PREVIOUS SPEAKERS BUT THE THE IMPACT THAT THIS WOULD HAVE ON TOURISM WOULD BE. WOULD BE ENORMOUS. WE HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT COME FROM NOT JUST ALL OVER THE COUNTRY BUT ALL OVER THE WORLD TO ENJOY A BEAUTIFUL COASTLINE. AND I DON'T CARE WHETHER YOU'RE SOMEONE LIKE ME IS GONNA BANDS WHO SPENDS A LOT OF TIME THE OCEAN SURFING I WHICH BY THE WAY THAT'S DEMOCRATS REPUBLICANS AND INDEPENDENTS THAT DON'T WANT TO SEE THESE DEREK'S. PEOPLE THAT ARE VISITING OUR STATE THAT ARE ENJOYING OUR BEACHES IN OUR IN OUR NATURAL BEAUTY ARE GONNA WANT TO SEE THESE AND IT'S GONNA BE A MAJOR IMPACT. TO TOURISM AYE AS WELL AS ALL THE OTHER ALL THE ECONOMIES. THAT ARE CONNECTED TO OUR COASTLINE AND AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT THAT THIS ISN'T JUST SOMETHING THAT WE ARE LOOKING ONLY TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN EXPRESSING. HOW WE FEEL IN TERMS OF HOW THIS DECISION THAT THEY'VE MADE IT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT ALL THOSE COMPANIES THAT WOULD BE WE? ARE LOOKING TO POTENTIALLY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS SITUATION AND ACTUALLY. START DRILLING OFF OF OUR COAST IN FEDERAL WATERS. THAT YOU KNOW WE HAVE A GOOD AYE IF YOU WANNA CONTINUE TO HAVE A GOOD WORKING RELATIONSHIP WITH THE STATE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S IMPORTANT. EITHER YOU DO NOT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF BECAUSE WE ARE VERY CLEAR IN A BIPARTISAN WAY OUT THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT RUNS. OPPOSITE OF OUR VALUES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THAT WE ASK THAT YOU JOIN US IN PARTNER WITH US IN OUR STAND OF PROTECTING OUR COASTLINE AND PROTECTING SOMETHING THAT IS SO IMPORTANT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER THURMAN YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I RISE TO SPEAK SUPPORT OF AJ ARE TWENTY NINE IS A PROUD CO AUTHOR. I LIKE TO THINK MY OUR. COLLEAGUE FROM SANTA BARBARA FOR BRINGING IT FOR. I WON'T REPEAT ALL THE THINGS IT YOU'VE HEARD. AND ALLOW SIMPLY SAY THIS OUT YOU KNOW THAT ARE CLOSE LINE IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT MAKES CALIFORNIA SPECIAL. I LOVE OUT REPRESENTING A DISTRICT THAT IS COMPLETELY SURROUNDED BY BAY AND WHILE I DO NOT HAVE AS MANY MILES OF SHORELINE IS HAVE BEEN STATED BY SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES. I AM TO A VISITING THEM AND. THOSE OF MY DISTRICT AND OUR SMALL CITY OF RICHMOND WITHOUT TWENTY THREE MILES OF SHORELINE WE APPRECIATE WHAT IS PROVIDED FOR US. HISTORY HAS SHOWN US THE DANGER THAT WILL COME FROM OFFSHORE DRILLING A LET US NOT REPEAT THE MISTAKES OF HISTORY WE KNOW WHAT HAVOC AND DEVASTATION. OFFSHORE DRILLING CAN CAUSE WE'VE SEEN IT AND IT'S OUR JOB TO STOP IT. FURTHER WE KNOW THAT CALIFORNIANS ARE LARGELY IN SUPPORT OF BLOCKING ANY. EFFORT. TO HAVE OFFSHORE DRILLING AS MANY AS NINETY PERCENT OF CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT PROTECTING OUR COASTLINE. WILD VERY VERY FEW ARE ASKING FOR DRILLING. IT'S MY BELIEF THAT OUR JOB HERE. IS TO SPEND OUR TIME FIGHTING FOR BATTLES THAT WILL MAKE FUTURE GENERATIONS PROUD OF OUR EFFORTS THIS IS ONE OF THOSE OPPORTUNITIES LET'S MAKE OUR CONSTITUENTS PROUD. LETS URGE CONGRESS AND THE PRESIDENT TO DO THE RIGHT THING I URGE YOUR SUPPORT OF AJ ARE TWENTY NINE. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER SCHABAS YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. YES I LIKE TO STAND SUPPORT AJ ARE TWENTY NINE. AND THE REASON I'M STANDING SUPPORTIVE BECAUSE I THINK MANY TIMES ON THIS FLOOR HERE WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE. THE PLUSES AND MINUSES OF AN ISSUE. WE KNOW THAT TATTOO TECHNOLOGY IN OUR SOCIETY WE'RE GOING TO BE MOVING AWAY FROM. OIL AS A PRIMARY DRIVER RIGHT TRANSPORTATION ARE NOW IN OUR ECONOMY. BUT THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN IN THE LIFETIME OF ANYBODY IN THIS ROOM. IT'S A PHASE IT OUT PROCESS. YOU JUST NEED TO LOOK AT THEIR EVERYTHING IN THIS ROOM TO CHECK PROBABLY FOR THE TABLES IN HERE HAS SOME SORT OF PLASTIC AND IT. IT COMES FROM MORRELL. A CALIFORNIA DOES HAVE. A LOT OF GOOD PEOPLE WHO MANAGES RESOURCE IN A VERY RESPONSIBLE WAY. AND I APPRECIATE WHAT THEY'RE DOING. HOWEVER THE TRADE OFF. IS FAR IS CHALLENGING WHAT'S REALLY BEAUTIFUL ABOUT CALIFORNIA HAVE BEEN RAISED IN A COASTAL COMMUNITY REDONDO BEACH. AND NOW REPRESENTING NORTH COAST OF SAN DIEGO. OUR BEACHES ARE UNIQUE TO THE WORLD AND WE NEED TO PROTECT THEM. THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT I'M AGAINST OIL I'M NOT AGAINST ALL AYE THIEVES THERE'S A PLACE FOR IT WE'RE GONNA PHASE THAT OUT. BUT I AM FOR THE HISTORY IN THE FUTURE OF CALIFORNIA FOR THE BEACHES AND FOR THAT REASON I RECOMMEND THAT WE NOT DO THIS. I THINK THAT. THE SECOND ISSUE I WOULD LAY OUT TOO MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. I SEE THIS IS A STATES RIGHTS ISSUE. WE AS A STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAVE THE RIGHT TO STAND UP AGAINST FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS. DECIDING WHAT OUR ENVIRONMENTS LIKE. YOU KNOW I FIND IT OF OUR PARTY WAS ABOUT THE VALUE OF THE STATE'S RIGHTS STANDING UP TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. I WANT TO BELIEVES FEDERAL GOVERNOR'S BASS WHEN IT'S. SMALLER AND FOCUSED ON THEIR MISSION. AND I WOULD SAY THE MISSION OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS NOT TO DEFINING. THE ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT OF CALIFORNIA. I RECOMMENDED WE VOTE IN SUPPORT OF AJ ARE TWENTY NINE. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER HARPER YOU'RE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM SPEAKER AND MEMBERS. LIKE I'VE SAID BEFORE. I BELIEVE THAT THESE RESOLUTIONS. CONGRESS AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. ARE INDEED A WASTE OF TIME FOR THIS BODY. AND I AND WORTHY OF OUR ATTENTION. YOU WANT TO COMMENT. SPEND YOUR TIME DEBATING ON FEDERAL ISSUES. RUN FOR CONGRESS. IT'S BEEN DONE BEFORE IT CAN BE DONE AGAIN. BONDING OUR TIME. WITH THE NON BINDING RESOLUTION ON CONGRESS I BELIEVE IS A WASTE OF TIME. AND LIKE RESOLUTIONS BEFORE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. I CAN TELL THAT YOU. AS MEMBERS OF THIS BODY. HAVE NOT TAKEN THE TIME TO CALL YOUR OVERLAPPING MEMBERS OF CONGRESS. BEFORE VOTING ON THIS RESOLUTION. IT'S A KIND OF SLACKTIVISM. YOU JUST SPEND A LITTLE BIT OF TIME HERE. RATHER THAN DOING THE REAL WORK. I'M COMMUNICATING WITH YOUR MEMBER OF CONGRESS DIRECTLY. IS THAT BECAUSE THAT YOU THINK IT'S A WASTE OF TIME OR THIS ISSUE ISN'T WORTH YOUR TIME. TO ACTUALLY COMMUNICATE WITH YOUR MEMBER OF CONGRESS. OR IS IT MAY BE BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T DEVELOPED A GOOD ENOUGH RELATIONSHIP WITH YOUR MEMBER OF CONGRESS. FOR THEM TO ACTUALLY RETURN YOUR CALL. CALIFORNIA HAS A THREE MILE LIMIT OF JURISDICTION. FEDERAL LAW. ONLY HAS CONTROL OVER BEYOND THOSE THREE MILES IF THIS WAS A DEBATE OF WHAT TO DO WITHIN OUR THREE MILE LIMIT. THEN ABSOLUTELY THIS IS WITHIN OUR JURISDICTION AND WORTHY OF OUR TIME. I UP TO SUCH PLATFORMS IN MY DISTRICT. BUT THIS ISN'T THIS ISN'T ABOUT WHAT'S WITHIN THE JURISDICTION OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I THINK THAT THIS RESOLUTION IS A RIDICULOUS WASTE OF TIME. AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO GET TO THE REAL ISSUES THAT WE'RE FACING ON THE LEGISLATIVE DOCKET. BANNING PLASTIC STRAWS OR HAVING A SUGAR TAX I GUESS WELL YOU KNOW WHAT MAYBE THOSE ARE BAD EXAMPLES TO BE ABLE TO USE. MAYBE IF THIS IS WHAT WE'RE USING OUR TIME FOR THOSE ARE GOOD ARGUMENTS FOR A PART TIME LEGISLATURE. WITH PART TIME PAY. I WILL NOT BE VOTING FOR THIS RESOLUTION. OKAY THINK CLEAR. ASSEMBLY MEMBER ALLEN YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN CALIFORNIA IMPORTS OVER SIXTY FIVE PERCENT OF OUR OIL AND GAS NEEDS. EVERY SINGLE YEAR. CALIFORNIA HAS MORE THEN OF OIL AND GAS FOR OUR ENTIRE STATE FOR TODAY AND FOR GENERATIONS TO COME. CALIFORNIA FURTHERMORE HAS SHUT DOWN ELEVEN REFINERIES SINCE NINETEEN NINETY REDUCING OUR CAPACITY FOR PRODUCTION. BY OVER TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND GALLONS PER DAY. WITH NOW AMONG THE NATION'S HIGHEST GAS PRICES WOULD NOW AMONG THE NATION'S HIGHEST UTILITY PRICES AND TAXES THAT SEEM TO COME OUT DALY OUT OF THE CALIFORNIA DEMOCRAT RUN BODY THAT WE STAND AND RIGHT NOW THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE. THE LAST THING WE NEED TO DO IS BE TELLING CALIFORNIANS THAT THEY CAN'T ACCESS THEIR OWN OIL AND GAS THAT BELONGS TO THEM. LET'S BE VERY CLEAR. THIS OIL AND GAS IN CALIFORNIA DOES NOT BELONG TO THIS LEGISLATURE IT DOES NOT BELONG TO ANY OF THE MEMBERS IN THIS ROOM ANYMORE THAN IT DOES TO THE THIRTY NINE MILLION CALIFORNIANS. THAT DEPEND UPON ENERGY FOR ALL THEIR DAILY NEEDS TO DRIVE BACK AND FORTH TO WORK TO USE OUR AIR CONDITIONER TO KEEP THEIR FOOD CALLED THE REFRIGERATOR. NGUYEN. SOLAR NUCLEAR ALL OF THESE OTHER ENERGY OPTIONS. OUR GREAT. BUT THEY PALE IN COMPARISON TO WHAT WE ACTUALLY USE. IN OIL AND GAS THERE'S NO REASON THAT CALIFORNIA SHOULD BE IMPORTING. APPROXIMATELY TWO THIRDS OF OUR ENERGY NEEDS EVERY SINGLE YEAR WHEN WE HAVE PLENTY IN THE GROUND RIGHT BELOW US. IT'S ABOUT TIME THAT WE STOP. MEASURES LIKE THIS THAT MAKE ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE AND ARE AN INJUSTICE TO THE THIRTY NINE MILLION CALIFORNIANS THAT WE REPRESENT IT'S ABOUT TIME WE START USING. USING IT'S ABOUT TIME WE STARTED USING OUR OWN RESOURCES FOR OUR OWN CITIZENS THAT IS WHO THEY BELONG TO. I URGE A NO VOTE ON THIS EGR AND I URGE EVERY CALIFORNIAN TO SUPPORT. THE EXTRACTION OF THE OIL AND GAS THAT BELONGS TO EVERY SINGLE CALIFORNIANS. WE CAN DO THIS CLEANLY. WE CAN DO THIS SAFELY WE CAN NEWS AN ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY MATTER AFTER ALL CALIFORNIA LEADS THE WORLD IN TECHNOLOGY. WE HAVE THE BEST WORKFORCE IN THE WORLD AND WE HAVE THE BEST TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA IT'S ABOUT TIME WE PUT THAT TECHNOLOGY TO USE. LET'S EXTRACT THE OIL AND GAS THAT IS RIGHT BELOW OUR FEET. IT IS ACROSS OUR ENTIRE STATE. ONSHORE AND OFFSHORE LET'S DO CLEANLY SAFELY ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY LET'S GET OFF OF THIS RELIANCE OF FOREIGN OIL LET'S STOP EXPORTING OUR DOLLARS IN OUR JOBS TO OTHER STATES. AND OTHER NATIONS LET'S USE OUR OWN RESOURCES THAT BELONG TO EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THE THIRTY NINE MILLION CALIFORNIANS. SO RICHLY DESERVE THEY HERITAGE IT'S RIGHT BELOW THEIR FEET. VOTE NO ON THIS AJ ARE AND LET'S USE OUR OWN OIL AND GAS FOR OUR OWN CALIFORNIANS. THANK YOU SEEING NO FURTHER DEBATED DISCUSSION ASSEMBLY MEMBER LOW MOAN WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE THINK YOU. I THINK TODAY'S DISCUSSION HAS BEEN AN IMPORTANT DISCUSSION BUT MORE THAN ANYTHING I WANT TO REMIND FOLKS THAT THIS IS ABOUT PLACING A VOTE FOR THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA.

TO PARTICIPATE IN THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATIONS OPEN COMMENT PERIOD THE ONE HEARING THAT CALIFORNIA'S GOING TO HAVE THIS AFTERNOON. THIS IS RELEVANT THIS IS MEANINGFUL. FOR THE MORE THAN FIFTEEN POINT EIGHT MILLION PEOPLE THAT WORK IN OUR COASTAL ECONOMY. THIS IS MORE THAN JUST A RESOLUTION. THIS IS ABOUT PROTECTING THEIR JOBS AND THEIR LIVELIHOOD. ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE IS MY FATHER WHO FOR MORE THAN FORTY YEARS HAS WORKED IN A HOTEL ON THE COAST. HE KNOWS WHAT IT IS LIKE. TO HAVE TO CLOSE THE HOTEL. TO SEE LESS PEOPLE THERE AND TO RELY ON INDUSTRY WHERE TIPS ARE IMPORTANT. AND WHEN WE DON'T HAVE A ROBUST ECONOMY SUPPORTING. THE VALUES OF CALIFORNIA SUPPORTING OF WHAT MAKES THIS STATE. AN INCREDIBLE STATE. STILL MANY LOSE OUT. SO TODAY I ASK FOR YOU TO PLEASE SUPPORT THIS RESOLUTION AND TO SAY YES ON BEHALF OF THE MORE THAN SIXTY NINE PERCENT OF CALIFORNIANS.
