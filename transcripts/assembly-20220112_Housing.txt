MORNING AND CONGRATULATIONS AGAIN ON BECOMING THE CHAIR OF THE SIX DREAMLAND PORTENT COMMITTEE -- MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M PLEASE TO THIS MORNING TWO PERCENT EIGHTY SIX EIGHTY TWO A MEASURE THAT WILL INCENTIVIZE CO HOUSING APARTMENTS CO HOUSING ALSO KNOWN AS COMMUNAL LIVING IS TYPICALLY MADE UP OF UNITS THAT ARE SMALLER THAN FOUR HUNDRED SQUARE FEET BUT THAT OFFER A SHARED KITCHEN AND DINING AREA THESE ARE TYPICALLY MORE AFFORDABLE THAN THE AVERAGE STUDIO OR ONE BEDROOM APARTMENT SO FOR EXAMPLE IN SAN FRANCISCO WHERE THE AVERAGE RENT IS ALSO WELL OVER THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS TO -- DEVELOPMENT STAR CITY DEVELOPMENT COMPANY STAR CITY BUILT CO HOUSING UNITS THAT AVERAGE TWO HUNDRED SQUARE FEET AND RENTED THEM FOR FOURTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH WHICH IS LESS THAN HALF OF THE CITY'S AVERAGE ROUTE THESE NATURALLY OCCURRING AFFORDABLE UNITS ARE IDEAL FOR THOSE WHO DON'T QUALIFY FOR SUBSIDIZED HOUSING BUT CAN'T COMPETE FOR MARKET RATE APARTMENTS WHAT WE ARE GONNA FREQUENTLY CALLED -- MISSING METAL THE CO HOUSING MODEL CAN ALSO BE USED TO HOUSE SENIORS AND FORMERLY HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS SINCE COMMUNAL LIVING PROVIDE A UNIQUE MIX OF BOTH PRIVACY AND COMMUNITY SUPPORT UNFORTUNATELY LOCAL RESTRICTIONS THAT REQUIRE A MINIMUM UNIT SIZE OR A MAXIMUM DENSITY HAVE MADE IT DIFFICULT TO BUILD CO HOUSING APARTMENTS EIGHTY SIX EIGHTY TWO WILL ALLOW CO HOUSING PROJECTS TO QUALIFY FOR INCENTIVES UNDER THE DENSITY BONUS LAW AND HELP MAXIMIZE THE NUMBER OF UNITS WITHIN AN ALREADY COSTLY PARCEL OF LAND THE MEASURE WILL REQUIRE DEED RESTRICTED AFFORDABLE UNITS IN EXCHANGE FOR CONCESSIONS AND INCENTIVES SUCH AS INCREASED DENSITY AND REDUCED PARKING EIGHTY SIX EIGHTY TWO WILL HELP DIVERSIFY THE HOUSING STOCK OFFERING BOTH NATURALLY OCCURRING AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND THE OPTION FOR COMMUNAL LIVING TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL IS JANE BLUMENFELD SENIOR FELLOW AT UCLA'S CITYLAB THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER BLOOM AND -- OPERATOR ANDERSON WE HAVE ONE WITNESS AND

THANK YOU KNOW IF WE CAN -- BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE MEMBERS I KNOW SOME REWARD HAS -- COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FOR A NEW HE'S PUT A LOT OF WORK INTO THIS EFFORT AND WITH A LOT OF PARTNER ORGANIZATIONS OUT THERE TO REALLY TRY TO -- HAVE BRING FOR A MEANINGFUL BILL THAT'S GOING TO PROVIDE JUSTICE FOR THAT MOST NORMAL CALIFORNIANS THAT NEED IT THE MOST -- I HAVE -- -- -- I'M VERY STRONGLY SUPPORTIVE OF THIS EFFORT AND I WANTED TO JUST -- ASK A POINT OF CLARIFICATION ABOUT THE ELLIS ACT ON DOES IT CURRENTLY AND AS I'M READING ANALYSIS AND SEMI DOCUMENTARIANS IS IT CURRENTLY ONLY APPLY TO JURISDICTIONS THAT HAVE RENT CONTROL OR DOESN'T APPLY TO ALL JURISDICTIONS FOR COMMONSENSE A QUESTION -- FOR CALIFORNIA NEEDED HIS MICROPHONE IS THE MICROPHONE YOU SOME THE GOVERNMENT CODE SEVEN SIXTY DOES NOT DIFFERENTIATE IT IS A STATE WIDE AND CAN BE INVOKED ANYWHERE AND I'VE SEEN IT INVOLVED IN COUNTIES THAT DO NOT HAVE RENT CONTROL BUT IT'S RARE I MEAN THE REASON IT'S INVOKED THIS TO PREEMPT LOCAL RENT CONTROL GOT IT AND SO AND DOES IT ONLY DOES THE ELLIS ACT CURRENTLY ONLY APPLIED TO RENT CONTROLLED UNITS OR DOES IT APPLY TO ALL RENTAL UNITS WELL IT APPLIES TO NEW RESIDENTIAL UNIT OKAY THANK YOU SO I SAW THAT YOU WERE TAKING COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS ARE PROPOSED COMMITTEE MMS AT LIMITED TO -- JUST ONLY UNITS WITHIN A JURISDICTION THAT HAS RENT CONTROL POLICIES IN PLACE IS THAT CORRECT THAT'S CORRECT SO -- AND HAVE BEEN REPORTED AFTER YOUR DESIRE AND THE COMMITTEE'S DESIRE -- I THINK WE'RE AT A POINT RIGHT NOW THOUGH IN CALIFORNIA WHERE THE SAME PRINCIPLE HERE REALLY APPLIES TO ALL RENTERS ACROSS CALIFORNIA -- WE SEAT MASS INCREASE IN PRICES THERE'S A LOT THIS UNDERLYING -- WHY THAT IS -- BUT FOR -- YOU KNOW THESE INDIVIDUALS WHERE YOU'RE WANTING TO SEE A LIMITED TO JUST EXISTING RENTAL AND TO THE RENT CONTROLLED UNITS WITHIN A JURISDICTION THAT ALLOWS FOR RENTAL CONTROL -- IT'S ONLY A SUBSET OF OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT -- TO REALLY TRY TO ADVANCE THE PRINCIPLES I THINK YOU'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE UNDER THIS BILL -- I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE SEEN IT YOU KNOW MOVE FORWARD A LITTLE BIT PRODUCT NOT BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY MORE CALIFORNIANS WHO MAY NOT HAVE THE ADVANTAGES OF LIVING IN THE CITY -- WITH THOSE PROTECTIONS OR I'D BE LIVING IN A BUILDING THAT ARE SUBJECT TO THOSE PROTECTIONS SO THE LOOK AT THE LIMIT OF EARLY FIFTY FOUR IS GOING TO BE ON WHAT SOMEONE LIMITED -- SO IF THAT IS SOMEHOW WE DON'T MOVE THE BILL FORWARD AS AS AMENDED AGAIN COMMEND YOU FOR THE WORK YOU'RE DOING -- I THINK YOU KNOW TO A LOT WHEN I RECOGNIZE YOU KNOW THAT THERE ARE OTHERS THAT MAKE -- INVESTMENTS THAT COULD TAKE RISK ON THAT I I BELIEVE ARE GOOD LANDLORDS WHO WANT TO GET IN THERE AND PROVIDE A MULTI UNIT HOUSING FOR SO MANY THAT THAT NEED ACCESS TO THE RENTAL MARKET I ALSO COMMEND MANY OF THE GOOD ACTORS THAT ARE OUT THERE -- BUT WHEN YOU'RE GETTING INTO THIS OPPORTUNITY YOU KNOW YOU'RE MAKING A LONG TERM INVESTMENT AND THE IDEA THAT -- YOU KNOW WE CAN'T LIVE WITH A FIVE YEAR PROHIBITION ON ACTION OF THIS NATURE DOESN'T SIT WELL WITH ME -- IF IF YOU'RE COMING IN YOU KNOW YOU'VE GOT INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE BEEN THERE FOR SOME TIME -- THAT YOU KNOW ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY DISABLED OR ELDERLY OR LOW INCOME -- THEY'RE GOING TO NEED IF YOU WANT MAKE IT LONG TERM DECISION ABOUT WHAT TO DO WITH THAT PROPERTY -- THAT IS -- YOU KNOW ALL WITH STILL WITHOUT WELL WITHIN YOUR RIGHTS TO BE ABLE TO DO SO -- IT IS JUST NOT FAIR -- ESPECIALLY UNDER THE CURRENT LANDSCAPE THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW WITH -- ALL YOU KNOW WHAT OTHER OTHER OPTIONS ON THE OTHER OPTIONS ARE -- YOU KNOW IMPOSSIBLY -- MORE EXPENSIVE -- HAVE A RENTAL MARKETS AND THAT'S EXPERIENCE THAT WE'RE SEEING HERE ON THE STREETS RIGHT NOW TODAY ON OUR IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD TODAY SO THANK YOU FOR BEING SUPPORT HAPPY TO MOVE THE BILL -- YOU KNOW FOR THE AUTHORS SOME WISHES AND I WANT TO THANK I'M SURE WE WE HAVE A MOTION TO BE THE SECOND MISCREANT AND MR SEROTONIN SPEAK THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND HEARING AND HAPPILY JOIN YOU IN THIS COMMITTEE AS WELL -- THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR FOR INTRODUCING AND WORKING ON THIS OKAY YOU GUYS CAN OKAY I'M VERY IMPORTANT POLICY AND I WANT TO THANK -- ARE LOS ANGELES CITY COUNCIL WHO APPROVED -- UNANIMOUSLY I YESTERDAY TO TO SUPPORT -- YOUR LEGISLATION AND TO ALL OF THE -- RESIDENTS OF THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES THAT HAVE CALLED AND I WAS HEARING SEVERAL MEMBERS ON THE L. A. COUNTY DEMOCRATIC PARTY AS WELL AS SEVERAL OTHER DEMOCRATIC GROUPS THAT ARE IN SUPPORT OF YOUR LEGISLATION AND THIS IS A PRIORITY AND I ALSO WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO ALL OF THE -- TENANT ADVOCATES THAT WE HAVE MADE IN THE LAST FEW YEARS THAT HAVE EXPRESSED JUST BE INCREDIBLE HURT FULL STORIES OF PEOPLE IN MY COMMUNITY THAT ARE BEING EVICTED OUT OF THEIR HOMES BECAUSE OF THE ELLIS ACT OF MY COMMUNITY MY DISTRICT IS ONE OF THE FASTEST GENTRIFYING AREAS WITHIN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES I HAVE MET WITH RESIDENTS IN ECHO PARK IN LINCOLN HEIGHTS IN EL SERENO AND HIGHLAND PARK AND ACROSS THE DISTRICT -- AND UNDERSTOOD THEIR STORIES IN TERMS OF HOW BECAUSE OF THIS RAPID GENTRIFICATION IN MY COMMUNITY FOLKS ARE COMING IN THEY'RE BUYING UP BUILDINGS THEY'RE SAYING THEY'RE GONNA KEEP THE RENTERS AND THEN USING THE ELLIS ACT TO ACTUALLY AFFECT THEM AND NOT HAVE THEM RETURN I WILL SHARE A PERSONAL STORY I USED TO BE A RENTER IN HIGHLAND PARK SMALL LITTLE ONE BEDROOM APARTMENT I WAS PAYING NINE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DOLLARS AND WHEN I MOVED OUT THAT APARTMENT BEGAN TO RUN FOR TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO WAY THAT I COULD HAVE AFFORDED THAT RENTED MY OWN COMMUNITY AND I CAN ONLY IMAGINE IF YOU'RE TRYING TO SURVIVE OFF A LIVING OF THE MINIMUM WAGE IN THE CITY OF LA WITH THE INCREDIBLE COST INCREASE TO A QUALITY OF LIFE HOW INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT IT IS TO LIVE IN THE CITY THAT ONE HAS GROWN UP IN BECAUSE OF THESE INCREDIBLE AS ARISES IN IN RENT OR IS ACTUALLY MORE EXPENSIVE TO RENT THEM TO EVEN TO TRY TO PAY A MORTGAGE ON A HOME SO IT'S THIS BACKWARDS WAY IN WHICH WE'RE TRYING TO CREATE SOLUTIONS TO AN INCREDIBLE PROBLEM AND SO I JUST WANNA THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK I WOULD LOVE TO BE ADDED AS A AS A CO AUTHOR JOINT AUTHORS TO HELP YOU ENSURE THAT THIS GETS OUT OF THE ASSEMBLY AND ON TO THE SENATE AND MOVES FORWARD AND GETS TO THE GOVERNOR'S DESK BECAUSE WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO DO THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER AND EXPECTING DIFFERENT RESULT IN THIS IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE SOLUTIONS TO OUR HOUSING CRISIS SO THANK YOU THANK YOU MISS CARILLO MR SACK I THINK YOU -- ARE BRINGING YOUR BILL FORWARD TODAY AND ALLOWING A GOOD DISCUSSION ABOUT IT BUT ONE OF THE CONCERNS I HAVE WITH THIS BILL IS HAVING COME FROM AN AREA IN WORK AREA WHERE YOU HAVE A LOT OF RENTAL HOUSING STANDARD IN A LOT OF IT IS INDIVIDUALLY OWNED YOU'LL HAVE SIX UNIT APARTMENT NINE UNIT APARTMENTS THAT ARE OWNED BY PEOPLE THAT ARE NOW ELDERLY THEY THEY BOUGHT THE PROPERTY WAY BACK YOU KNOW AND THE THE FIFTIES AND SIXTIES AND THEY'RE NO LONGER CAN TAKE CARE OF THESE PROPERTIES -- AND FRANKLY THEY WERE FOR THE PROPERTIES ARE FIRE TRAPS -- THEY NEED TO BE REMOVED AND REBUILT AND THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES TO DO THAT BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO BE WHAT THE MOM IN THE POT IT'S GOING TO BE WITH A DEVELOPER THAT COMES IN AND TAKES SIX TO NINE UNITS IN WITH A DENSITY BONUS LAWS IS ABLE TO PUT IN TWENTY FIVE UNITS SO WHAT IT DOES IT HELPS ON THE SUPPLY SIDE BECAUSE RIGHT NOW THAT'S THE PROBLEM WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH SUPPLY IF SOMEBODY GETS EVICTED THEY SHOULD BE EASILY ABLE TO MOVE OVER TO ANOTHER APARTMENT BUT THOSE APARTMENTS DON'T EXIST AND THE REASON THEY DON'T EXIST IS BECAUSE WE MADE IT TOO EXPENSIVE TO BUILD AND GET THROUGH A PROCESS IN CALIFORNIA NOT JUST IN RURAL AREAS ARE NOT JUST IN SUBURBAN AREAS BUT IN URBAN AREAS ALSO WHEN YOU HAVE TO SPEND FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A DOOR TO BUILD AFFORDABLE UNITS THAT'S NOT AFFORDABLE AND UNTIL THAT IS CORRECTED WE CAN DO ALL OF THESE THAT WE WANT IT'S NOT GOING TO FIX THE PROBLEM -- I FEEL SORRY FOR THE TENANTS I FEEL SORRY FOR THE OWNERS BROUGH BECAUSE WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO WE'RE TRYING TO PICK SIDES INSTEAD OF WORKING ON WHAT THE REAL PROBLEM IS AND THAT IS THE COST THAT IT TAKES TO BUILD A UNIT YESTERDAY I WAS SITTING IN A COMMITTEE THEY PASSED THROUGH IN ORDER ARE A -- THEY POTENTIAL BILL THAT RAISES THE COST OF A HOUSE BY THIRTY THOUSAND MORE DOLLARS AS I AS YOU KNOW I BROUGHT UP THE POINT YOU GUYS YOU TAKEN FOR FOR HER FIFTY THOUSAND TO FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A DOOR WE'RE NOT GONNA GET WE'RE NEVER GOING TO CATCH UP ON THIS PROBLEM IF WE DON'T START FOCUSING MORE ON THE SUPPLY ISSUE AND IN THE PROCESS THAT'S RESTRICTING THAT SUPPLY SO I APPRECIATE THESE EFFORTS BY EVERYBODY TO TRY TO ADDRESS THIS BUT KEEPING PEOPLE IN SUB STANDARD HOUSING BECAUSE YOU WE DON'T WANT THE EVIL DEVELOPER TO COME IN AND BUILD MORE HOUSING THAT IS WHEN THEY'RE DONE BUILDING IT'S JUST GONNA COST A LOT BECAUSE IT STILL ISN'T GOING TO HELP THAT THAT -- RENT -- ISSUE MY KIDS LIVE IN LA THEY RAN THEY PAY WAY MORE THAN I DID EVER FOR A HOUSE MORTGAGE -- IT'S IT'S TERRIBLE AND IN ITS UP INCUMBENT ON US TO REALLY LOOK AT WHAT THE REAL PROBLEMS ARE WORK ON THOSE AND AND NOT MAKE IT WORSE BECAUSE TO ME THIS IS THIS IS RESTRICTING PEOPLE FROM TAKING WHAT ARE SUB STANDARD NINETEEN THIRTIES AND FORTIES STRUCTURES AND KEEPING THEM BECAUSE THEY CAN'T GO THROUGH A PROCESS TO IMPROVE AND UNFORTUNATELY THAT PROCESS IS PEOPLE HAVE TO MOVE OUT SO YOU CAN CLEAR THE PROPERTY BUILD NEW AND BUT THEY NEED SOMEWHERE TO GO WE JUST DON'T HAVE THAT AND SO BY KEEPING THEM IN PLACE WHERE THEY ARE IS NOT GOING TO SOLVE THAT PROBLEM EITHER IT'S JUST GOING TO KEEP A SUB STANDARD SIXTY NINE UNIT APARTMENT OR A TOWN HOME OR CONDO IN PLACE SO -- YOU KNOW FOR ME FOR ME I HESITATE TO TO BE IN FAVOR OF ANY BILLS LIKE THAT ARE TRYING TO ADDRESS NOT THE PROBLEM AND JUST MAKING IT SO THAT WERE STUCK WHERE WE ARE SO -- I APPRECIATE IT THOUGH AND IT AYE AYE WE DO AGREE WITH YOU WHOLEHEARTEDLY WE HAVE TO GET A HANDLE ON THIS -- BUT I JUST FEEL LIKE WE'RE ATTACKING THE WRONG WRONG PLACE THANK YOU CAN I RESPOND TO THE CHAIR -- IF YOU COULD RESPOND ARE CLOSING AND TO THE CLERK OF COUNCIL AS THEIR SPECIFIC QUESTIONS AND MR THANK YOU CHAIR REX OF THE SOUNDS REALLY GOOD -- I REALLY APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND YOU KNOW MY MY FAMILY'S KIND OF LIVED THE AMERICAN DREAM IN MANY WAYS I WAS BORN INTO AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND NOW NOT ONLY BE HOMEOWNERS BUT WE ACTUALLY HAVE RENTAL PROPERTY MOST OF WHICH ARE THERE GOES A SENIOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING OR SECTION EIGHT FAMILIES -- AND IT OVER ME THINK ABOUT THE THINGS THAT WE NEED TO DO ON HOUSING THERE ISN'T ONE THING THERE ARE MANY THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH IN DOING THEM AT LEAST MAYBE NOT AS FAST AS WE CAN OR SHOULD BUT WE'VE ACTUALLY MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION WHETHER YOU KNOW SB NINE IN TERMS OF DENSITY INTERFILM EIGHTY USE AND WE'RE TRYING -- BUT WITHIN THE LIMITATIONS OF WHAT WE CAN DO WITH LOCAL JURISDICTIONS -- AND WHAT WE DON'T WANT TO DO IS TAKE TWO STEPS FORWARD ONE STEP BACK WEHRUM ON THE ONE HAND YES WITH THE BILL MORE SUPPLY BUT WE'RE LOSING TENS OF THOUSANDS OF AFFORDABLE RENTAL UNITS AT THE SAME TIME -- A AND SO GETTING YOU KNOW GETTING AROUND THE INTENTION OF ELLIS I GOT THE I SEE THIS IS AS SOLIDIFYING -- THE UNDERLYING INTENTION OF THE L. SECOND ATTEMPT BUT IN PROTECTING RENTERS AND THERE IS NO EXCUSE -- ESPECIALLY IF SOMEONE'S OWN PROPERTY FOR DECADES TALK ABOUT THE VALUE OF HAVING THAT PROPERTY IF THEY WERE TRULY GOT IT DECADES AGO SUB STANDARD HOUSING AND THAT'S A PROBLEM WITH THE LANDLORDS THAT THEY AND I KNOW THAT THERE'S ALWAYS IMAGES OF YOU KNOW THE THE LIKE TO BE PUT OUT THERE OF ALL MODERN POPS WHAT HAVE YOU -- BUT THE REALITY IS THAT IF YOU HAVE A PROPERTY -- OF THE IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE -- YOU KNOW THEY'RE NOT JUST COMPLY ONCE YOU HAVE AN ABILITY BUT TO CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT THAT -- IS NOT JUST LIVABLE BUT IS QUALITY AND -- YOU KNOW THE THE THE ANECDOTAL OF ALL THIS IS GOING TO KEEP PROPERTIES ARE BEING FIXED UP WHAT HAVE YOU -- THAT THAT'S A DECISION MORE OFTEN THAN NOT BY THE LANDLORD AND THEIR PROFIT MARGINS AND AND AND WHAT THEY WANT TO SQUEEZE CENTER VENTURES WE'VE SEEN THAT FAR TOO MUCH AND IT GOES TO THE POINT OF WANTING TO GET RENTERS OUT SO YOU CAN BRING NEW VENTURES AND AT MARKET RATES AND THAT'S REALLY THE ULTIMATE SQUEEZE THAT -- YOU KNOW AGAIN THE DAY IS A DEBATE BETWEEN LANDLORDS AND TENANTS POSSIBLY IF WE HAD TO PICK A SIDE I'M GONNA PICK A SIDE OF THOSE THAT WE COULD END UP HOMELESS -- THESE ARE NOT NORMAL CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS OR AGREEMENTS WAS JUST THINKING ON BUYING A SANDWICH FROM YOU HERE'S A RECEIPT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SOMEONE'S HOME IT'S WHERE THEY LIVE AND -- YOU KNOW THAT TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND -- I CONTROL HOMES IN LA THEY'RE GONE NOW -- THAT'S A THAT'S TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND MORE FIND HOUSING FOR -- IN IN AN INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE MARKET AS EVERYONE HAS ACKNOWLEDGED AND SO -- I COME I COMMEND YOU AND I WOULD LAS YA SE IS EVEN THE OPPOSITION IN THE VERY SMALL NUMBER AN EXTREMELY SMALL PERCENTAGE OF ACTIONS THAT THAT'S THE CASE THE MOST THE BIG DEAL IT IS TRULY A SORT OF EXTREMELY SMALL -- IT WHAT I WOULD SAY ON THE ONE HAND WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL OF THIS WAY OF STREAMING SMALL BUT TO THOSE THAT ARE BEING AFFECTED BY IT THE CHANGES OUR WHOLE LIFE AND SO ON THE ONE HAND I DON'T THINK IT'S GONNA BE OVERLY BURDENSOME ON THOSE THAT TRULY -- HAVE GOOD INTENTIONS IN TERMS OF RENTERS ARE -- BUT LANDLORDS AND AND BUYING A PROPERTY -- BUT IT CAN BE LIFE CHANGER FOR THOSE OTHERWISE WOULD BE LEFT WITHOUT A HOME AND SO ABSOLUTELY SUPPORT IT AND WOULD LIKE TO JOIN AS A PRINCIPAL AUTHOR -- IF IF THE AUTHORS -- PREFERENCE THANK YOU MISTER KALRA ANY OTHER QUESTION OUR CINEMA QUICK SILVA CAN ON A QUESTION OF THE AUTHOR IF YOU COULD EXPLAIN THE AMENDMENT THAT YOU DID TAKE YES I AM HAPPY TO EXPLAIN THAT SO WE TOOK THE AMENDMENT TO LIMIT THE SCOPE ONLY TO RENT CONTROLS OR SECTIONS AS OUR CAL EXPLAINED SO NOW THIS WOULD ONLY AFFECT TWENTY ONE OUT OF FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO CITIES IN CALIFORNIA AND NOW I WHOLEHEARTEDLY AGREE I WISH YOU WERE BROADER SENSE I THINK BY A SPECIFIC TARGET THE MOST NORMAL RIGHT NOW FOLKS WHO ARE RENT CONTROLLED UNITS RIGHT NOW IS THE -- THE SPURNING APPROACH AT THE MOMENT SO THAT'S THE KIND OF THAT SEEMINGLY TOOK SO THE COMMENTS THAT -- I AM I'M GOING TO MAKE OUR ARE MIXED IN THE SENSE THAT -- THIS DECISION ON THE ALICE ACT IN THE CHANGES YOU'RE BRINGING FORWARD IS NOT JUST A ONE YEAR DISCUSSION I WAS HERE IN TWENTY TWELVE TWENTY THIRTEEN TIME WAS VERY DIFFERENT AT THIS TIME THE HUGE DIFFERENCE THAT I HAVE SEEN UNDER HOUSING JUST AS A WHOLE IS OF COURSE THE SPECULATOR MARKET NOW IF YOU TALK TO ME ABOUT THIS ALMOST TEN YEARS AGO AND EVEN WHEN I WAS ON COUNCIL IT WAS A VERY DIFFERENT TIME AND TWO THOUSAND FOUR TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN TWELVE WHEN I SERVED WE WEREN'T EVEN TALKING ABOUT HOMELESSNESS ON THAT SO SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES WHO SERVED ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT WILL KNOW THAT BEFORE OUR EYES WE HAVE SEEN ONE OF THE WORST CRISIS IS OF OUR TIME AND THAT IS LITERALLY PEOPLE NOT ONLY LIVING ON THE STREET THAT ARE HOMELESS BUT ARE DYING ON THE STREETS SO AS A LEGISLATOR I HAVE TO TAKE IN WHAT I CONSIDER PASSED INFORMATION PRESENT AND THEN LOOK TOWARDS THE FUTURE AND AS MY COLLEAGUE ASSEMBLYMEMBER SAY ARE TO ASSESS SOME OF WHAT HE SAYS REALLY DOES MEAN SOMETHING WHICH IS WHAT ARE WE DOING NOW TO BUILD AFFORDABLE UNITS AND ARE THEY REALLY AFFORDABLE IF WE CAN'T GET THIS PRODUCTION MOVING AND WE COULD SPEND ALL DAY AND WE DID SPEND MANY MANY DAYS OVER THE -- RECESS TALKING ABOUT HOW DO WE MOVE FORWARD WITH HOUSING PRODUCTION BECAUSE THAT'S REALLY ONE OF THE ONLY WAYS THAT WE'RE GOING TO GET TO START TO SEE SOME TYPE OF MARKET RATE AFFORDABILITY IS BY HAVING THAT SUPPLY AND DEMAND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS A VERY MEASURED POINT ON ONE OF THE TOWARDS WAS THAT WE HAVE MORE PEOPLE SITTING IN RENTAL UNITS MARKET RATE NOT NECESSARILY AFFORDABLE THAT SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET IN THE HOUSING MARKET BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO SALARIES MAY BE WELL OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND BUT THERE AREN'T THE UNITS FOR THEM TO MOVE INTO AND THEY'RE HOLDING THOSE UNITS WHICH THEN -- PEOPLE WHO ARE STARTED COMING OUT OF COLLEGE TRYING TO GET IN THERE MOVED OUT OF THOSE UNITS BUT IN THIS CASE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AFFORDABLE UNITS I DID HAVE A MEET WITH A FEW PEOPLE OF DISCUSSED IT AND LIKE I SAID ON THE SPECULATOR MARKET ONE OF THE THINGS WE'RE NOT JUST SEEN IT AND RENTALS OR SEEN IT AND HOUSING SOME OF OUR SHOWS I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU WATCH BUT I KNOW A GOOD DECADE DECADE AGAIN I STARTED WATCHING I THINK IT WAS SIX OR UPPER OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND WE ALL THOUGHT IT WAS KIND OF A FUN SHOW AND I DID TO MAGNOLIA HOMES OR WHATEVER THEY'RE DOING IN OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY AND THEN THEY SELL IT FOR PROFIT THIS ALL SEEMS THAT YOU KNOW BUT OUR ISSUE IS THAT AS OUR SUPPLY IN CALIFORNIA SHRINKS THIS NOW EVEN WITH GREAT INTENTIONS IT REALLY STARTS TO LIMIT FOR OUR ENTRY LEVEL BUYERS SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL TO GET TODAY I DO HAVE CONCERNS -- BUT THE LAST THING I WANT TO DO IS EXASPERATED A PROBLEM THAT WE SEE BEFORE OUR EYES THAT WE CAN NOT A RACE NO MATTER WHAT WE WANT TO SAY WE HAVE A TENT CITY NOW OUTSIDE ON FOURTEENTH STREET ON THE PERIMETER OF OUR CAPITAL THIS IS NOT HERE EVEN IN NOVEMBER OR WHEN WE ARE IN RECESS AUGUST SO THIS IS NOT AN EXAGGERATION IT'S WHAT WE SEE AND THE GREAT COUNTY OF ORANGE COUNTY WHICH WE PRIDE OURSELVES ON BUSINESS AND TOURISM WE HAVE OVER THIRTY PEOPLE DYING A MONTH ON THE STREETS OF ORANGE COUNTY WE HAVE TO DO BETTER AND IF THIS AT LEAST CAN KEEP PEOPLE HOUSE THAT ARE IN THOSE UNITS THAT IS SOMETHING I'M WILLING TO SUPPORT ON THE OTHER HAND AS A TEAM HERE AND IN OUR BUILDING WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO CUT OUT ALL THESE BARRIERS TO PRODUCTION AND GET BUSY BUILDING BECAUSE WE'RE NOT DOING THAT THANK YOU THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS OKAY -- ED SMM RELIEF YOU'D LIKE TO CLOSE AND FEEL FREE TO DRESS YOUR COLLEAGUES HERE BUT THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE ROBUST CONVERSATION I REALLY DO ENJOY -- A DEBATE ABOUT IT I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY A COUPLE THINGS IS THAT UNDER THIS BILL REFLECTIVE OF A COMPROMISE THE LONG TERM LANDLORDS SAY WHO OWNED PROPERTY SINCE THE NINETEEN FIFTIES OR NINETEEN SIXTIES STILL CANALSAT CAN STILL USE THE ELLIS ACT THE FIVE YEAR HOLDING PERIOD ONLY APPLIES A FIVE YEARS OF OWNERSHIP NO MATTER WHEN THAT STARTED COULD BE NINETEEN FIFTY FIVE COULD BE TWO THOUSAND FIVE AS LONG AS IT'S FIVE YEARS YOU CAN STILL USE THAT RIGHT -- YOU CAN SEE THAT THE REBELS ACT TO LEAVE THE RENTAL MARKET SO WE BUILT THAT INTO THE BILL TO MAKE SURE THAT A LONG TIME LANDLORDS WHO PERHAPS IN THE CASE WHO ARE AGING OUT AND CAN NO LONGER TEND TO THE RENTAL PROPERTIES THAT'S FINE THAT'S OKAY THE STILL CAN USE ALSO ACT AND IF THIS BILL WERE TO PASS THE STILL ARE FREELY ABLE DO THAT THIS BILL IS TARGETED TOWARDS PROPERTY SPECULATORS WHO IN VERY RECENT HISTORY BY A PROPERTIES IN WITHIN THE FIRST ONE TO FIVE YEARS FOR THEM LIKE THAT I REMEMBER WHEN THE FLIP UNITS LIKE THAT IT DOES NOT CREATE A NET NEW UNITS THERE ARE NO NEW UNITS YOU'RE CONVERTING A FORMER UNITS TO MARKET RATE UNITS SO IN EFFECT THAT WORSENS THE HOUSING CRISIS UNFORTUNATELY AND I AGREE WITH YOU I THINK THE IDEAL WORLD IS WHERE WE A PLENTIFUL SUPPLY WHERE IF SOMEONE WERE UNFORTUNATE DISPLACED AND HAD TO MOVE OUT FREELY AND EASILY BE FIND ANOTHER PLACE OF COMPARABLE STANDARD COMPARABLE PRICE BUT THAT'S UNFORTUNATE WHERE WE'RE AT RIGHT NOW SO THIS MEASURE IS NOT INTENDED TO BE PRODUCTION MEASURE BUT IT IS A DEFENSE MEASURE DEFENSE AGAINST INCREASING HOMELESSNESS THE GRANTING EVICTION AND ALSO CLARIFIED UNDER EXISTING LAW BECAUSE I KNOW THERE'S SOME -- MISINFORMATION OUT THERE UNDER EXISTING LAW UNDER AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO WHICH WAS PASSED THE COUPLE YEARS AGO BY OUR PREVIOUS HOUSING CHAIR -- THE INTENT TO OCCUPY RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY BY THE OWNER OR THEIR FAMILY IS STILL A NO FAULT JUST CAUSE EVICTION AND WE INTEND TO DEMONSTRATIVE CENSURE MODEL RISEN TO PROBABLY SO SAVY THAT FAMILY SOMEONE TO HOLD ON TO THE SUB STANDARD UNIT AND THEY WANT TO REMODEL IT THEY COULD STILL UNDER EXISTING LAW VIC FOLKS TO REBUILD -- BUT STILL EXISTING LAW SO TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS THAT THE FACTS ARE OUT THERE THAT THOSE LONG TERM SMALL MOM AND POP LANDLORDS STILL HAVE THEIR RIGHTS THEY CAN STILL -- UCL SACK BECAUSE I THINK THE RESULTS -- SPREAD THE SMALL MOM POOR MOM POPS WHAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW IS EXPLOITATION BY VERY LARGE ACTORS AND I CAN'T REALLY IMAGINE IN THE POST TWENTY EIGHTEEN WORLD OF MANY SMALL MOM POP WINERIES CAN MUSTER THE KIND OF CAPITAL RIGHT NOW IN THIS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE MARKET TO BUY A PROP IS A QUICKLY I WE WANT TO PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF SMALL MOM POP MY LORDS BUT ALSO MAKE SURE THAT VULNERABLE TENANTS THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS TENANTS ACROSS CALIFORNIA ARE NOT FACING THE REALITY OF HAVING TO SLEEP ON THE STREETS OR BECOME HOMELESS OR DESTITUTE THAT'S A REAL PROBLEM WE HAVE SO AGAIN WHY THANK YOU ALL FOR THE GREAT CONVERSATION TODAY AND URGE YOUR IPHONE THANK YOU THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEAVE FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD AND FOR YOUR TENACIOUS SUPPORT -- ON THE BILL AND -- AS MENTIONED THE BILL WOULD LIMIT THE USE OF THE OIL SECTOR THOSE PROPERTY OWNERS WHO HAVE MAINTAIN OWNERSHIP FOR AT LEAST FIVE YEARS -- I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE MEASURE TODAY SECTORS ORIGINALLY ENACTED TO LET PROPERTY OWNERS LEAVE THE RENTAL HOUSING BUSINESS BUT ALL TOO OFTEN WE DO KNOW THAT THIS IS USED BY SPECULATIVE REAL ESTATE BUYERS WHO BUY A PRINT CONTROL BUILDINGS AND THEN -- FLIP THEM ESSENTIALLY THE CONDOS AND I WILL SAY I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS -- ON THE DICEY FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND YOU KNOW DO I THINK THE BOTTOM LINE IS THIS IS AN ALL OF THE ABOVE -- THIS PROBLEM IT'S AN ALL THE ABOVE SOLUTIONS IS WHAT WE NEED SO THAT DOES MEAN SUPPORTING THINGS LIKE SUPPLY PRODUCTION BILLS LIKE SB NINE AND OTHERS THAT PRODUCE HOUSING AND SO AS YOU ALL KNOW I'M A BIG SUPPORTER OF THOSE TYPES OF BILLS BECAUSE I DO AGREE MISTER SECTOR WE DO HAVE TO BUILD MORE HOUSING BUT IT ALSO MEANS WE HAVE TO PROTECT OUR MOST VULNERABLE ANNABLE TENANTS TO AVOID A HOMELESSNESS -- AS A MEMBER AT KALRA HAS SUGGESTED SO I WILL BE -- SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY THE MOTIONS DO PASSED AS AMENDED THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS MEMBER BOARD AND A SECOND BY A SENTIMENT ON THE SEVEN MEMBER CARILLO PLEASE TAKE A ROLL WICKS HI HI THEY ARE DON'T KNOW THEY ARE NO CARILLO KOREA I'D GABRIEL GABRIEL I KALRA KALRA AYE KILEY HIGHLY NO QUICK SILVA COOK SILVA AYE WARD WARD I THE BILL IS OUT AND WE WILL GO BACK TO FILE ITEM ONE ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA RIGHT YEAH YOU KNOW I YEAH WE WILL OFFER SOME SOLUTIONS THE WORD DO YOU YEAH WE ARE NOW BACK ON FILE ITEM ONE ASSEMBLY WOMAN GARCIA EIGHTY SIX SEVENTY TWO YOU MAY BEGIN S. THANK YOU THIS BILL ESTABLISHES AN INCENTIVE PROGRAM TO WRITE GRANTS TO LOCAL PUBLIC AGENCIES TO FACILITATE THE CONVERSION OF MUNICIPALLY OWNED GOLF COURSES INTO AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND OPEN SPACE AGAIN THIS IS VOLUNTARY OR COMMUNITIES THAT FEEL THIS MEETS THEIR NEEDS -- I LIVE IN THE CITY OF ALL OF OUR AGENTS WORKING CLASS COMMUNITY YOU'VE HEARD ME TALK ABOUT IT AND REGRET LOW INCOME ON TOP OF THE LIST OF WHAT KINDS OF THINGS YOU DON'T WANT TO BE ON INCLUDING LACK OF HOUSING LACK OF OPEN SPACE A LOT OF POLLUTION OUT THERE FROM MY HOUSE ALONE I HAVE ABOUT SEVEN LOCAL GOLF COURSES THAT ARE ALL SUBSIDIZED BY THE TAXPAYERS OUT THERE -- AND LIMIT OUR AXES OUT THERE JUST IN ONE CITY ALONE I HAVE TO EIGHTY HOLD OFFICES NEXT TO EACH OTHER ARE SEPARATED BY A HALF A MILE OUT THERE AND SO I THINK AREAS LIKE THIS I HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO RETHINK THE SPACES AND STARTERS RESTED NUMBER OF ISSUES OUT THERE AND SO THESE AT INCIDENT DOLLARS IDENTIFIED IN THE LEGISLATION WILL GIVE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ANOTHER TOOL IN THEIR TOOLBOX TO MEET THEIR RENOWNED NUMBERS WHILE ALSO GIVING LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS THE OPPORTUNITY TO LIVE IN A SAFE AND AFFORDABLE HOMES OUT THERE LAST RECESSION -- THE CHURCH TALKED ABOUT HAVING THE AT LARGE TOOLBOX OF SOLUTIONS AND THIS IS JUST ANOTHER -- I THINK SMALL OF PIECES THAT DISCUSSION AS WELL I HAVE A LOT OF DENSITY IN MY DISTRICT AND OTHER THAN BROWN FEELS -- THE ONLY OTHER SPACE BECAUSE THERE TO LOOK AT OUR THESE UNUSED GOLF COURSES I WALKED BY ONE EVERY DAY I'M HOME -- AND I WOULD SAY WITHIN A MONTH TIME I PROBABLY SEE SIXTY FOR THE WHOLE MONTH THERE ARE IN A COMMUNITY THAT HAS SIXTY THOUSAND RESIDENTS OUT THERE ALSO THIS BILL REALLY ALLOWS THE SISTER TO RETHINK BOTH ARE HOUSING REQUIREMENTS IN OUR OPEN SPACE REQUIREMENTS FOR VERY PARK OR IN MY COMMUNITY THERE'S A GOAL BY THE GOVERNOR ATTEMPTS TO SET ASIDE THIRTY PERCENT A WILDLANDS COASTAL AND LAND AND WATERS AND OPEN SPACE TO PROTECT CALIFORNIA'S EVERY CITY -- AND I THINK OPENING OUR GOLF COURSES TO INCLUDE OPEN SPACE AS A WAY TO HAVE A RETHINK THAT IN THE URBAN SETTINGS LIKE MINE I WANT ONE MORE TIME REITERATE THAT THIS IS VOLUNTARY AND JUST GIVES LOCAL AGENCIES AND OTHER TOOL TO RETHINK THEIR PROFITS BACK HOME TO ADDRESS THEIR NEEDS AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA I BELIEVE WE HAVE -- TWO WITNESSES IN SUPPORT AND TWO WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION I WANT TO REMIND WITNESSES YOU WILL HAVE TWO MINUTES I WILL BE KEEPING A TIMER SO TO KEEP US ON TIME HERE -- AND OUR FIRST WITNESS IN SUPPORT IS JOINING US BY PHONE ELIZABETH HANSFORD ARE YOU THERE YES FROM HERE MY NAME IS ELIZABETH CAMP BURKE I RUN THE ORANGE COUNTY YIMBY YES IN MY BACKYARD GROUP CALLED PEOPLE FOR HOUSING ORANGE COUNTY -- WE ARE STRONG SUPPORTERS OF THIS BILL AND AND VERY GRATEFUL TO THE ASSEMBLY WOMAN FOR ARE MOVING FORWARD WITH THIS IDEA -- SO CITIES IN COASTAL CALIFORNIA ARE LOOKING FOR SITE TO ACCOMMODATE ARENA NUMBERS INCLUDING THE MUCH LARGER REMEMBER THAT WE HAVE GOTTEN IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA HOUSING -- AND YET WE HEAR FROM CITIES ALL THE TIME YOU KNOW WE CAN'T WE CAN'T BUILD WERE BUILT OUT WE DON'T HAVE ANY LAND WELL HERE'S THE LAND AND IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE CONSIDERED THE CITY ON SITE BECAUSE ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAYS TO REDUCE THE COST OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING YOU KNOW THAT THE COST PER DOOR IS TO USE PUBLICLY OWNED SITES -- ANOTHER BENEFIT IS THAT GOLF COURSES ARE LARGE PARCELS AND WE CAN INTEGRATE THAT AFFORDABLE HOUSING INTO A LARGER HOUSING AND OPEN SPACE PLAN TO CREATE NEW NEIGHBORHOODS ARE RIGHT NOW -- CITIES ARE SCRAMBLING TO FIND YOU KNOW SITE BUT THEY OWN SOME OF WHICH ARE LIKE YOU KNOW IN INDUSTRIAL AREAS THAT YOU KNOW I MEAN WILL USE THEM IF WE HAVE TO BUT WOULDN'T IT BE BETTER TO HAVE YOU KNOW COMMUNITIES THAT OFFER A RANGE OF HOUSING TYPES AND PRICE POINTS AND TO BE ABLE TO CREATE A NEW COMMUNITY AROUND OPEN SPACE AND THAT'S WHAT A GOLF COURSE GIVES YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO -- I WAS A PLANNING COMMISSIONER FOR THREE YEARS IN THE CITY WHERE I LIVE AND -- THE PROJECT WHERE WE FACE THE MOST OPPOSITION AND WHAT COUNCIL WAS RELUCTANT TO MOVE FORWARD WERE ONES WHERE THEY SAID OH YOU KNOW WE DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THAT WE HAVEN'T WE HAVEN'T SEEN LEADS AND THIS WOULD GIVE FUNDS TO CITIES TO START THAT PROCESS TO START PUTTING FORWARD THOSE RENDERINGS WHAT IS THIS GOING TO LOOK LIKE TO KIND OF GET COMMUNITY BUY IT -- AND THEN I GET THE LAST THING I'LL SAY IS THAT YOU KNOW WE REALLY HAVE TO ASK OURSELVES HOW WE WANT TO USE OUR PUBLIC RESOURCES DO WE WANT PUBLIC LAND AND PUBLIC RESOURCES TO BE USED TO SUBSIDIZE AN EXPENSIVE HOBBY OF A FEW PEOPLE OR WOULD WE RATHER USE THAT PUBLIC RESOURCE CAN PROVIDE YOU HOUSING OPPORTUNITY FOR MANY PEOPLE INCLUDING MANY WHO BEEN SHOT OUT OF HIGH OPPORTUNITY COMMUNITIES WHERE THE GOLF COURSES ARE LOCATED THE COUNTS -- TRY THAT SOME WOMAN SAID YOU KNOW THIS IS A VERY OPTIONAL IT'S AN OPTION IT'S ONE TOOL IN THE TOOLBOX AT THE TOP OF THE CITY COUNCIL THE IF YOU COULD WRAP UP THANK YOU OKAY YEAH THAT'S FINE THANKS THANK YOU ANNA OUR NEXT A WITNESS IN SUPPORT -- DAVID BARBOZA RIGHT DAVID ARE YOU THERE DAVID BARBOZA MADAM CHAIR WE'RE

THE CALIFORNIA WINES WITH GOLF I'LL BE VERY WITH RESPECT TO EXISTING LAW THERE'S NO DISCUSSION ANYWHERE IN THE ANALYSIS OF THE AUTHOR AND THE CONVERSION OF PUBLICLY ON GOLF COURSES THE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT DIVISION BY THE BILL WOULD VIOLATE THE EXTENT PARK PRESERVATION ACT OF NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE IT WOULD VERY LIKELY LEAD TO WHAT THE STATE PASSED LIKELY NEED TO YEARS OF LITIGATION WHICH WE BELIEVE WILL LIKELY RESULT EXPECTED NOTIFICATION OF IT SIX SEVENTY TWO THE STAFF ANALYSIS POSITS THE CONCLUSION THERE'S NOT SUBSTANTIAL PRESIDENT THE COMMERCIAL GOLF COURSES TO OTHER USES IS BECAUSE THE PARK PRESERVATION ACT THERE'S BEEN A SUBSTANTIAL BAR UNDERSTOOD IS ONE OF SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE SPECTER'S FISCAL AFFECT THE MOST RECENT JANUARY DRAFT OF THE BILL HAS DROPPED A FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR PRICE TAG PRIOR SEPTEMBER NINTH DRAFT AS NOW DRAFTED THE BILL GIVES NO IDEA OF THE SCOPE OF THE BILL'S INTENTIONS THAT'S SOMETHING BLANK TO BE FILLED IN LATER YES -- AS WE AND I MIGHT ADD MANY THIS APOLOGIES LONG GOLF COURSES THANK LIKELY THE PARK RESERVATION ACT APPLIES ANY PROCEEDS FROM HOUSING DEVELOPMENT WOULD BE MORE THAN EATEN UP BY THE PARK RESERVATIONS ACT REQUIREMENTS THE PROCEEDS OF THE TRANSACTION WOULD HAVE TO BE USED BY THE CITY'S REQUIRE SUBSTITUTE PARK LAND AS SECTION FIFTY FOUR OF FIVE THE PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE REQUIRES IN QUOTE BY GENERALLY THE SAME PERSONS USE THE EXISTING PARK LANDS OF CELERY ALTHOUGH MANY AND WE DO AGREE INTERPRET THAT TO MEAN THAT A RECREATIONAL USE ANOTHER COPY SATISFIES THE REQUIREMENTS MURSCHEL HANDLE RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENTS DOES NOT THIS REPRESENTS A SERIOUS CONTRADICTION THAT AFFECTS NOT LAW YES -- WITH RESPECT TO THE ECONOMIC REFORMS OF THE GOLF IS CHEN MY THAT I'M QUITE FAMILIAR WITH THE TWO GOLF COURSES IN ROUGHLY A MILE AND
