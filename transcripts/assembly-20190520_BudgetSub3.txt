GOOD EVENING ANYTIME YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU CHAIR BLOOM. MY NAME IS MEREDITH WILLIAMS I AM THE ACTING DIRECTOR FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL. WE'D LIKE TO THANK THE LEGISLATURE FOR ITS SUPPORT FOR THE DEPARTMENT OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS. THE FUNDING SUPPORT AND OVERSIGHT BY THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW PANEL. HAS ENABLED US TO IDENTIFY SOME OF OUR BIGGEST CHALLENGES AND TO MAKE INROADS INTO ADDRESSING THEM. WITH THE LOAN TO SUPPORT THE X. I. CLEAN UP WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO CLEAN UP MORE THAN EIGHT HUNDRED HOMES AND PROPERTIES. AND WE'RE ON TRACK TO CLEAN OUR THOUSAND HOME THIS SUMMER. WE'VE IMPLEMENTED TWENTY NINE OF THE FORTY SIX OR FORTY SIX INDEPENDENT REVIEW PANEL RECOMMENDATIONS AND ANOTHER THIRTEEN ARE IN PROGRESS. AND THE FUNDING TO IMPROVE PERMITTING PROCESSES AND IT HAS ENABLED US TO MAKE MORE TIMELY AND ENFORCEABLE PERMIT DECISIONS. ELEVEN DURING FISCAL YEARS FISCAL YEAR. SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN THESE ARE JUST A FEW HIGHLIGHTS TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF OUR PROGRESS. THAT SAID. DURING OUR JANUARY JOIN OVERSIGHT HEARING WE TALKED ABOUT THE DEPARTMENT'S ORGANIZATIONAL TRANSPARENCY AND BUDGETARY CHALLENGES. I REMAIN FOCUSED ON THESE ISSUES AND CONTINUE TO BE PLEASED BY OUR PROGRESS. CHIEF DEPUTY NEGRI AND NINE AND THE ENTIRE EXECUTIVE TEAM ARE COMMITTED TO TACKLING ARE PROBLEMS OF COURSE NOTHING HAPPENS OVERNIGHT. AND WILL BE PUBLISHING A NEW STRATEGIC PLAN IN THE NEAR FUTURE. SO THAT YOU HAVE THE PUBLIC CAN HAVE VISIBILITY INTO OUR PATH FORWARD. THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW PANELS FIVE MAIN PRIORITIES ALIGNED WITH THE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES OF THAT STRATEGIC PLAN. UNFORTUNATELY THE DEPARTMENT'S LONG STANDING STRUCTURAL DEFICIT HAS REACHED A POINT WHERE WE MUST NOW RELY ON GENERAL FUND MONIES. THE REQUESTED GENERAL FUND BACK FILL OF TWENTY SEVEN POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR FISCAL YEAR NINETEEN TWENTY AND EIGHTEEN POINT FIVE MILLION FOR THE FOLLOWING TWO FISCAL YEARS. WILL GIVE US TIME TO WORK WITH YOU THE GOVERNOR. AND OUR STAKEHOLDERS TO IDENTIFYING A SUSTAINABLE FUNDING SOLUTION. THIS REQUEST ALSO ENABLES US TO ACHIEVE GREATER BUDGET TRANSPARENCY AND INCLUDES THE ELIMINATION. OF THE GENERAL FUND LOAN REPAYMENT FROM THE LEAD ACID BATTERY CLEAN UP FRONT. FREEING UP THOSE REVENUES TO BE USED FOR CLEANING CONTAMINATED SITES AROUND FORMER LEAD ACID BATTERY FACILITIES. WHEN WE WERE BEFORE YOU IN JANUARY WE UPDATED YOU ON OUR EFFORTS TO GET OUR FINANCIAL HOUSE IN ORDER? WE DISCUSS THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING ACCURATE INFORMATION ON BUDGET AND WORKLOAD WHICH UP UNTIL THAT POINT HAD PROVED QUITE ELUSIVE. TO ENSURE THE INTEGRITY OF OUR AND ANY FEE REFORMS. WE MADE FURTHER FURTHER PROGRESS ON OUR FISCAL GOVERNANCE WE'RE WORKING WITH OUR PARTNERS INCLUDING FISCALE IN THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE. TO STAY ON TRACK FOR AN ON TIME YEAR END CLOSING. AND THE AUDIT WE MENTIONED IS NOW IS UNDER WAY. WE'RE CONTINUING OUR WORKLOAD STUDY AND WILL SOON RELEASE A STRATEGIC PLAN WITH PERFORMANCE METRICS FOR EACH OF THE DEPARTMENTS. GRAMS. FOR TRANSPARENCY OUR PERFORMANCE AGAINST KHIMETRICS WILL BE DISPLAYED ON OUR NEWLY UPDATED WEBSITE. COLLECTIVELY THESE EFFORTS WILL PROVIDE THE INFORMATION NEEDED TO DETERMINE THE LEVEL OF FUNDING REQUIRED TO DELIVER MISSION. THIS INFORMATION WILL BE FOUNDATIONAL TO THE WORK OF A FEW TASK FORCE PER THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION. WE ARE COLLABORATING WITH THE NEW ADMINISTRATION AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. TO DETERMINE WHAT ORGANIZATIONAL AND FISCAL REFORMS ARE NECESSARY TO ENSURE THE DEPARTMENT EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY. PROVIDES ADEQUATE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION THROUGHOUT THE STATE AGAINST TOXIC SUBSTANCES. I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. DOES LA -- OR SHOP SHAMA WITH LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE% YEAH -- WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED THE REQUEST FOR TWENTY SEVEN POINT FIVE MILLION GENERAL FUND AND THE OTHER BUDGET ADJUSTMENTS IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY HOWEVER WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE REJECT. REQUESTS FOR EIGHTEEN POINT FIVE MILLION GENERAL FUND IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO IN RECENT YEARS THE DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF NUMEROUS LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT HEARINGS. I DO TO FISCAL DIFFICULTIES IN ALSO OPERATIONAL CONCERNS THAT WE'VE HAD WITH THE DEPARTMENT. APPROVING ONLY WHEN YOU'RE A GENERAL FUND BACK FILL WILL REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT TO COME BACK NEXT YEAR AS PART OF THE BUDGET PROCESS AND CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW TO ADDRESS THE SHORTFALLS IN THE HAZARDOUS WASTE CONTROL ACCOUNT. THE TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL ACCOUNT. THANK YOU DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THERESA KELLER WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I AM WE HAD AS WAS MENTIONED PROPOSED A MULTI YEAR PLAN FOR THIS FUNDING GIVEN. THAT FEE REVENUES WOULD TAKE A WHILE TO MATERIALIZE -- BUT WE ACKNOWLEDGE ALSO THAT CONVERSATION ABOUT THE FUNDING OF THE STRUCTURE WILL BE ON GOING SO -- WE APPRECIATE THE RECOMMENDATION FOR THE BUDGET YEAR FUNDING TO MAINTAIN CURRENT OPERATIONS WITH REGARD TO THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION ON LANGUAGE WE SUPPORT THE CONCEPT OF COURSE OF IMPROVING TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY ABSENT LANGUAGE IT'S HARD FOR US TO COMMENT ON THE SPECIFICS BUT SUPPORTING THE CONCEPT OF TRANSPARENCY ACCOUNTABILITY IN. THIS AREA [inaudible] THANK YOU -- A LET ME ADD SOME COMMENTS ANOTHER MAYBE -- ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS -- OF FROM THE DYESS BUT WE'RE WE'RE HERE TODAY WE HAD A TIME WHEN THE HAZARDOUS WASTE CONTROL ACCOUNT TO WHICH IS ONE OF THE TSA'S. MAIN ACCOUNTS IS PROJECTED TO BE IN A DEFICIT -- IN THIS BUDGET YEAR -- AND UNFORTUNATELY THE OTHER MAN ACCOUNT THE TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL COUNT IS PROJECTED TO BE INSOLVENT. IN THE NEXT TWO OR THREE YEARS. AND THE PROPOSAL BEFORE US IS ESSENTIALLY ASKING FOR THE STATE TO FILL IN THE COST OF THAT GAP THAT SHOULD BE BORNE BY THE REGULATORY REGULATED COMMUNITY. THE DEPARTMENT'S DIFFICULTIES LIKELY ARE -- I THINK WE KNOW THERE RESULT OF MULTIPLE FACTORS THOUGH UNDOUBTEDLY A MAJOR FACTORS THE SHORTAGE OF FUNDING FROM BOTH. OF THESE TWO ACCOUNTS. BUT WE ALSO KNOW THE DTS THESE PROBLEMS ARE NOT LIMITED TO FISCAL ISSUES. THE DEPARTMENT IS LONG FACED A WIDE RANGE OF CRITICISMS INCLUDING EXTREMELY LONG PERMIT PROCESSING TIMES. POR ENFORCEMENT DELAYED SITE REMEDIATION AND AT TIMES OF FAILURE TO RESPOND TO PUBLIC CONCERNS. NUMEROUS INTERNAL EFFORTS TO IMPROVE THE FUNCTIONING OF THE TNC UNDER SEVERAL DIRECTORS HAS NOT RESULTED AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN MANY RECOMMENDATIONS. OF THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW PANEL HAVE STILL NOT BEEN IMPLEMENTED. EVEN ADEQUATE FUNDING. I IS NOT. A THE ONLY SOLUTION THAT WILL IMPROVE DTS SEES DECISION MAKING OR MAKE THEIR DECISIONS MORE TRANSPARENT. AND SO ALONG WITH APPROVING -- THIS GAP FUNDING FOR ONE YEAR. OF THIS COMMITTEE IS PROPOSING A SUITE OF CHANGES TO THE DEPARTMENT THAT IS AIMED AT IMPROVING ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY. AFFECT OF REGULATION OF HAZARDOUS WASTE IS ESSENTIAL FOR THE PROTECTION OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND THIS REALLY CANNOT WAIT ANY LONGER -- ARE THERE ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS. MR FONG FOLLOWED BY OTHERS REST. A JUST TO FOLLOW UP ON WITH THE CHAIRMAN HAD SAID WHAT ARE SOME OF THE RESTRUCTURING. CONCEPTS ARE IDEAS THAT ARE BEING DISCUSSED IF YOU COULD SHED SOME LIGHT AND AS A WHAT'S BEING DONE TO KIND OF DEAL WITH THE STRUCTURAL ISSUES. THAT EXISTS WITHIN THE AGENCY. I WOULD SAY AT THIS POINT WE'RE STILL IN HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IN THE ADMINISTRATION ON ON STRUCTURE BUT IT WOULD IT WOULD. INCLUDE SOME OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN OFFER BY THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW PANEL AS WELL AS LOOKING AT HOW WE'RE ORGANIZED -- IN TERMS OF OUR PROGRAMS AND AND AND OUR STOPPING LEVELS AND INSURING THAT -- WE'RE CURRENTLY IN THE MIDDLE OF CONDUCTING A WORKLOAD ANALYSIS -- THAT WORKLOAD ANALYSIS IS GOING TO ASSIST US WITH IDENTIFYING GAPS IN WHERE WERE ABLE TO MEET YOUR STATUTORY MANDATES AND WE'RE WE'RE NOT IN SOME OF THE RESTRUCTURING WILL BE TIED TO THE THE RESULTS OF THAT ANALYSIS. SO ARE THERE SOME THINGS THAT YOU AGREE WITH THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO ADD THAT YOUR THE WORKING ON IMPLEMENTING OR YOU GONNA WAIT. I GUESS UNTIL. SOMETHING GETS THE I MEAN I DON'T KNOW WHAT WHAT YOU WAITING FOR BUT I GUESS IN TERMS OF GETTING SOMETHING IN IN THE PROCESS OF BEING MOVED MOVING ALONG TO TO TO RESTRUCTURE. IF YOU'RE REFERRING TO THE THE THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW PANEL I WOULD SAY THAT WERE ABSOLUTELY CONSIDERING ALL THOSE THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT THE PAL HAS MADE AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO HAVE A VERY CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF OUR WORKLOAD AND WHAT RESOURCES WE ARE A SIGN. OR OR THE RESOURCES THAT WERE USING FOR SPECIFIC STATUTORY MANDATES TO UNDERSTAND -- WHAT RESOURCE -- REQUIREMENTS WOULD BE TIED TO THOSE RESTRUCTURED. THAT THE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR RESTRUCTURE THAT THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW PANEL MADE AND SO -- WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF CONDUCTING THAT ANALYSIS AND WERE ON SCHEDULED TO CONCLUDE THAT ANALYSIS BY THE FALL. I GUESS MY CONCERN IS MAYBE THE LA -- CAN CHIME IN HERE TOO IS THAT YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE DOING A ONE TIME. A LITTLE THE WHAT THAT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IS IS THERE'S GONNA BE A ONE TIME BACK FILL BUT THEN. I MEAN IT'S IS THAT POPULATE THE THAT YOU'RE GONNA COME BACK NEXT YEAR OR THE NEXT COUPLE YEARS ASKING FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO BACK FILL SOMETHING. IF SOMETHING'S NOT HAPPENING OR WHAT WERE THERE'S NOT A OF THE PROCES MOVING FORWARD TO ACTUALLY GET -- DGSE OF FROM UNDER THE THE THE THE SITUATION BEING INSOLVENT -- I GUESS THAT'S THE LIE LARGER CONCERN THAT I SHARE WITH THE CHAIRMAN IS. IS. IS THERE REALLY A PLAN TO GET OUT OF INSOLVENCY NEXT YEAR AND THE YEAR FOLLOWING. IT SHOULD SHOULD WE IDENTIFY THE AMOUNT OF RESOURCES REQUIRED THAT AND KNOW WHAT FEE STRUCTURE WOULD BE REQUIRED. TO TO CREATE ADEQUATE REVENUE. THERE WILL BE A TIME. IT WILL TAKE TIME TO GET THOSE FEES IN PLACE TO TALK TO OUR STAKEHOLDERS ABOUT WHATEVER FREE FOR PROPOSALS WE PUT FORTH. AND THEN OF COURSE OBVIOUSLY TO TO BRING THAT -- ANY FEE PROPOSALS BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE'S SO IT IS. HIGHLY UNLIKELY THAT WE WOULD SEE REVENUE FROM A NEW FREE STRUCTURE. IN THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR. MAYBE THE LA -- CONVENE CHIME IN IN TERMS OF SURE OF THAT. AND SO WHEN I LOOK AT THAT THE RECOMMENDATION THE AGENDA THEY RATED DOT TO PLACE HOLDER TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. TO CREATE A FEW TASK FORCE WHICH IS INTENDED I BELIEVE TO ADDRESS ISSUES REGARDING THE FEE AND ESTABLISH A FEE STRUCTURE THAT WILL SUPPORT THESE PROGRAMS IN THE LONG TERM IT'S A HAZARDOUS WASTE CONTROL ACCOUNT. THE TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL ACCOUNT HOWEVER. THAT I THINK THERE'S A REALIZATION AND IT'S GONNA TAKE OF THAT WORKING GROUP AWHILE TO COME TO A CONSENSUS. AND THEN ADOPT THE WHATEVER FEES THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO AGREE UPON -- SO THERE IS THE LIKELIHOOD THAT IN FUTURE YEARS THERE WILL BE ADDITIONAL NEEDS TO BACK FILL. ON THESE FUNDS IN ORDER TO FOR THEM TO MAINTAIN SALT. AND TO TO FINITARY MAIN SOLVENT -- AND THEN IT REGARDING THE THEY'RE LOOKING AT OTHER OPTIONS HERE RESTRUCTURING DGSE TO IMPROVE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY IN DECISION MAKING I DON'T HAVE ANY DETAILS ON THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE AND WHAT SPECIFICALLY THAT WOULD ENTAIL. AN HOUR BUT WITH ALL THE SIX IT ALSO LOOKS AS THOUGH WE'LL BE DOING A CONNECTING TO STEADY POTENTIALLY ON HOW TO RESTRUCTURE THE SAFETY CONSUMER PRODUCTS PROMINENT WILL GRAMS THAT ARE CURRENTLY HOUSED. IN DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS AND HOPEFULLY CHIEF IDENTIFY SOME EFFICIENCIES THAT COULD BE ACHIEVED THERE. SO THE OF I'M AND READING BETWEEN THE LINES -- YOUR ANALYSIS PROBABLY INDICATES THAT -- THE THE INSOLVENCY PART AND THE STRUCTURAL CHANGES WILL. THE WON'T FIT BE IT WILL BE DEALING WITH THIS SITUATION NEXT YEAR. AND THE YEAR AFTER PROBABLY MOST LIKELY. I THINK THERE'S A LIKELIHOOD THAT THAT WILL THAT WILL HAPPEN YES AND THAT THERE WILL BE A NEED. TO TO PROVIDE SOME GENERAL FUND TO BACK FILL THESE TWO FUNDS IN THE FUTURE. IS THERE ANY TALK OF A MAYBE THAT IS THERE ANY TALK OF OF OF NOT AB OF TRYING TO FIX THESE CHALLENGES -- TO NOT HAVE TO DO THIS NEXT YEAR I MEAN IS IT POSSIBLE TO GET THIS FUND SOLVENT BETWEEN. TO NOW NEXT YEAR OR AND ARE NOW JUST A POSSIBLE. I THINK WITH THE TIMING AND THE AND THE BUT THE MAY REVISION PROPOSAL ENVISIONED WAS KIND OF THE THREE YEARS RIGHT THAT IT WOULD BE -- THAT FUNDING IN NINETEEN TWENTY AND DURING THAT THE SUBSEQUENT TWO YEARS WHICH IS WHAT THAT MAY REVISION PROPOSED IT WOULD THERE WOULD BE TIME AND NEEDED TO PUT. A NEW FEE SCHEDULE PLACE ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT BOTH OF THE FUNDS I THINK THAT'S KIND OF WAS THE RECOGNITION THAT THIS IS KIND OF A LONGER -- A LONGER TIME LINE. TO TO PUT FORWARD. THANK YOU. MISTER YEAH UNFORTUNATELY I THINK THERE'S A TIME LINE OF OFFER GETTING ANY KIND OF FEE RESTRUCTURING DONE THAT'S PART OF THE PROBLEM HERE IT'S SO WE'RE NOW -- A ROUGHLY EIGHTEEN MONTHS -- POST THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW PANEL'S RECOMMENDATIONS AND WE'RE SITTING HERE LOOKING AT A A DEFICIT -- MOVING FORWARD IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS THAT OTHER TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT -- WILL BE RELEASED IN THE NEXT -- OF VERY SHORT TO OF GOD THE NEXT FEW DAYS -- WILL PROVIDE LANGUAGE SHOP FOR IMPROVING TRANSPARENCY ACCOUNTABILITY AND AND DECISION MAKING. ON THOSE THINGS HOWEVER GOING TO BE IF THEY'RE ADOPTED IN THE BUDGET ARE GOING TO BE IMPLEMENTED IN THE NEAR TERM THANK IN A WAIT. OF UP FOR THE FUTURE MITHRAS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- GOING BACK TO THE FEES. YOU STEPPED UP AND BEEN INCREASED IN ALMOST TWENTY YEARS IS THAT CORRECT THAT'S CORRECT. SO IN TWENTY YEARS THERE'S BEEN NO EFFORT TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT. HOW TO PUT TOGETHER FREE HE STRUCTURE THAT IS GOING TO HELP THE DEPARTMENT GET OUT FROM UNDER ALL OF THIS HAS THEIR? WE'VE ACTUALLY DONE A FAIR AMOUNT OF ANALYSIS I THINK ONE OF THE CHALLENGES FOR US IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE ALIGNED WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND WITH THE ADMINISTRATION ON THE LEVEL OF SERVICE IT'S BEEN ALL THAT NEEDS TO BE OFFERED. NO OVER THE COURSE OF THAT TWENTY YEARS THERE'S BEEN A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE LEGISLATIVE MANDATE FOR THE DEPARTMENT. AND THAT HASN'T BEEN ALIGNED WITH THE ADJUSTMENTS AND SO WE HAVE TO TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT WHEN WE COME UP WITH THE FLICK BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT. AND CLEARLY WE HAD AN INFORMATIONAL HEARING AND WE'VE ALREADY BEEN ABLE TO DISCUSS ALL OF OUR DEEP DEEP CONCERN WITH THE DEPARTMENT IN ALL OF THE THE FAILING SO YOU YOU YOU ARE THE ACTIVE DIRECTORY YOU'RE YOU'RE COMING IN. TO A SERIOUS PROBLEM THE DIRECTOR TALKED ABOUT -- WHO WAS THE GENTLEMAN WHO WHO SPOKE THE SECTOR? SECRETARY BLUNT. AND HE ASSURED US THAT WE WOULD BE MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. WHAT ONE OF THE COMMENTERS MADE IS THAT YOU'RE WORKING ON PUTTING TOGETHER A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING? OF YOUR WORK LOAD. HOW'S THE LEGISLATURE GIVES ADDITIONAL WORK -- PASSES LEGISLATION. THAT'S INCREASING YOUR WORKLOAD AT SOME POINT SOMEBODY HAS TO SAY WE NEED ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT BUT IF NOBODY IS REVIEWING OR IT SEEMS THAT NOBODY IS REVIEWING. WHO IS IT THAT LOOKS TO SEE WHAT THE WORK LOAD IS WHETHER YOU CAN DO IT WHETHER YOU CAN AFFORD IT RATHER THAN WAIT UNTIL? YOU'RE. IN THE RED AND WE HAVE SO MANY STRUCTURAL PROBLEMS WITH THIS WHO REFUSE THIS. FOR ANY FOR ANY LEGISLATION THAT GOES THROUGH WE DO AN ANALYSIS OF THE IMPACT ON THE DEPARTMENT IN TERMS OF THE DEPARTMENT'S RESOURCES. AND AFTERNOON THAT I'M SORRY AFTER AN ANALYSIS IS DONE. I ASSUME THERE'S A CONCLUSION THAT'S REACHED AND WITH THE CONCLUSION IS REACHED WHY DO WE WAIT TWENTY YEARS BEFORE WE'RE EVEN TALKING OR PUTTING TOGETHER. A FEE INCREASE. THERE ISN'T ENOUGH MONEY AND IT EVERY YEAR IT'S A REQUEST FOR ADDITIONAL MONEY TO BACK FILL AND ONCE AGAIN THERE'S AN ADDITIONAL REQUEST. I I ACTUALLY AGREE WITH THE LA -- ABOUT DOING THIS FOR JUST A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME THAN PUTTING TOGETHER THE FEE TASK FORCE. BUT IT JUST SEEMS THAT THERE WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT IF SOMEBODY IS REVIEWING THIS INTERNALLY THEY WOULD BE LOOKING TO SEE. WHERE THE PROBLEMS ARE AND WHY IT IS THAT WE CAN'T? BE IN THE BLACK IN THIS WHY IS IT THAT WE ARE ALWAYS IN IT IN A DEFICIT AND TO CONTINUE TO GROW IT ISN'T SOMETHING THAT JUST HAPPENED THIS YEAR. I'M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT. CLEARLY THE LACK OF ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY. AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO SOMETHING BUT I JUST I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT THE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A HE THE MIRACULOUS FIX TO THIS. THIS IS VERY DEEP VERY VERY VERY TROUBLING THE WAY THIS IS CONTINUE TO GO THERE ARE A NUMBER OF PIECES OF LEGISLATION LAST YEAR. TO TRY TO WORK ON THIS THE THE GOVERNOR VETOED THE BILL'S SAYING HE WOULD EXPECTED THE DEPARTMENT TO TO WORK THEM OUT. AND HERE WE ARE STILL WITH THE SAME PROBLEMS. I AM I I AM VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THAT. WHAT WOULD YOU SAY IS THE PRIMARY REASON FOR THE DELAYS IN PROCESSING PERMITS? I AM I WOULD ACTUALLY SAY THAT WE'VE DONE A TREMENDOUS JOB IN IMPROVING THE THE LENGTH OF TIME IT TAKES FOR PERMIT DECISIONS. IF YOU LOOK AT NINE PERMIT DECISIONS THAT WERE MADE I BELIEVE IN A FISCAL YEAR. SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN THE AVERAGE TIME TO MAKE THOSE PERMIT DECISIONS WAS TWENTY THREE MONTHS AND THAT'S IN DIRECT CONTRAST TO THE AVERAGE OF FOUR YEARS THAT IT USED TO TAKE US TO DO A PERMANENT. AND WE'VE CONTINUED TO DECREASE THE AMOUNT OF TIME IT TAKES TO DO THE PERMITS. WE HAVE WITH THE ADEQUATE RESOURCES WE MAPPED OUT OF COURSE TO BEING ABLE TO MAKE 90% OF OUR PERMIT DECISIONS WITHIN TWO YEARS AND WE BELIEVE WE HAVE THE PROCESS IS IN PLACE. AND THE STAFF TRAINING -- UNDER WAY TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT SO YOU'LL SEE YOU KNOW LAST YEAR WE ISSUED ELEVEN PERMIT DECISIONS WE THINK WILL ISSUE TWELVE PERMIT THIS. DECISIONS THIS YEAR ON THE WAY TO GETTING TO SIXTEEN PERMIT DECISIONS A YEAR. AND SO WHAT WE ARE ON THE THE THE RESOURCES WE'VE BEEN GIVEN OVER THE YEARS TO ADDRESS OUR PERMITTING -- ARE PERMITTING CHALLENGES HAVE REALLY BORN A LOT OF FRUIT IT'S NOT THAT VISIBLE TO FOLKS BUT IN FACT WE ARE MAKING MUCH MORE TIME WE PERMIT DECISIONS. DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THE STAFF RESOURCES. YOU DO HAVE. ALLOWS YOU TO BE CAPABLE OF ADDRESSING THE CORE RESPONSIBILITIES THAT ARE SIGNED TO THE TO THE DEPARTMENT. AGAIN. I WOULD REFER TO WHAT CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR DEGREES MENTIONED WHICH IS THAT. THERE ARE SOME GAPS AND WE KNOW THERE'S SOME GAPS AND WE ARE WORKING VERY HARD TO UNDERSTAND WITH GREAT SPECIFICITY WHAT THOSE GAPS ARE. YOU KNOW WE KNOW. I COULD SIT HERE AND TELL YOU A COUPLE AREAS WHERE I THINK WE MIGHT HAVE SOME CHALLENGES BUT THE WORKLOAD ANALYSIS GIVES THIS THAT DETAILED. NUMERIC QUANTITATE QUANTIFIED ANALYSIS OF WE'RE THOSE CHALLENGES LIE AND WITHOUT GOING THROUGH THAT PROCESS WE WILL BE. YOU KNOW MAKING GUESSES ABOUT WATER RESOURCE REQUIREMENTS ARE. I DON'T THINK ANYBODY AT ANY TIME WOULD WANT. SUCH AN IMPORTANT DEPARTMENT TO BE GUESSING. BUT WE CERTAINLY WOULD EXPECT. THAT AFTER ALL THESE YEARS THAT WE WOULD HAVE MORE THAN GUESSING. DOES THE DEPARTMENT HAVE THE PERSONAL CAPACITY TO DO. WHAT YOU BEEN ASKED TO DO? THAT'S THE ONE I WOULD JUST SAY THAT -- WHERE ARE WE ARE AS WE GO THROUGH INCOMPLETE EACH PROGRAM AND LOOK AT -- THE CURRENT STOPPING LEVELS THE WORKLOAD YOU KNOW AS SIGNED TO THOSE PROGRAMS WERE BEGINNING TO SEE SOME GAPS BUT WE NEED THE ENTIRE WE NEED TO COMPLETE THE ENTIRE WORKLOAD ANALYSIS TO SEE. WHETHER OR NOT WE HAVE -- WE HAVE DEFICIENCIES IN SOME AREAS THAT COULD BE -- MANAGED BY RE DIRECTION OF RESOURCES IN OTHER AREAS AND SO THAT'S WHY IT'S DIFFICULT FOR ME TO SAY. PRELIMINARILY THAT WE HAVE A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF DEFICIT AT THIS POINT PURSES WHEN WE COMPLETE THE ANALYSIS WE SHOULD HAVE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. TO UNDERSTAND EXACTLY OF ALL OF OUR RESOURCES ARE ALIGNED WITH OUR MANDATES AND OUR STRATEGIC PRIORITIES THAT WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF FINALIZING RIGHT NOW. SO -- I'M NOT TRYING TO PASS OFF THE ANSWER BUT I THINK IT WOULD BE JUST A LITTLE BIT PREMATURE TO SAY RIGHT NOW. YOU KNOW WHAT THIS EXTENSIVE UNDER RESOURCING IS I DO EXPECT SOME PROGRAMS TO BE. THERE TO BE A GAP BETWEEN HOW THE RESOURCE AND WHAT THEIR MANDATES ARE AND I'D LIKE TO COMPLETE THE ANALYSIS BEFORE WE SAY THAT WE NEED ADDITIONAL RESOURCES RATHER THAN RE DIRECT. AND YOU SAY THE YOU WILL CONCLUDED THE ANALYSIS BY FALL WE'RE ON TARGET FOR THAT AND AT DO YOU WOULD YOU AGREE THAT IF AFTER FALL YOU COMPLETE THIS ANALYSIS YOU PROVIDE US YOUR RESPONSE AND IF YOU'RE STILL IN IN IF IF IT'S STILL THE STRUCTURAL DEFICIT. YOU WOULD YOU WOULD ACCEPT THAT THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE SOME SERIOUS CHANGES AT THAT POINT. WELL I'VE ONE APPOINTMENT IS UNABLE TO DEAL WITH THE RESPONSIBILITIES AT SOME POINT THE HOUSE HAS TO BE SOME CHANGE ABSOLUTELY I I WANT TO DIFFERENTIATE -- BETWEEN DOING THE WORKLOAD ANALYSIS AND THE CURRENT BUDGET SITUATION THAT WE'RE IN RIGHT NOW WITH THE FEES VERSES. YOU KNOW THAT WHAT WE'RE BRINGING IN VERSUS WHAT WE'RE SPENDING WE KNOW THERE'S A DEFICIT THERE THERE BEEN. FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN JUST NOT EVEN -- MANDATES BUT IN JUST THE COST OF A STATE OPERATIONS OVER THE PAST FIVE TO TEN YEARS SO. THAT'S EXACERBATED THE STRUCTURAL DEFICIT -- SO -- YES THE WORKLOAD ANALYSIS WILL GIVE US SOME INFORMATION BUT TODAY WE DO KNOW THAT WE ARE NOT BRINGING IN A SUFFICIENT AMOUNT OF FEES TO COVER OUR THE COST OF OF OUR STATE OPERATIONS. JUST FINALLY MISTER CHAIR YOU SAY TODAY YOU KNOW ME. CLEARLY ANYBODY WHO'S LOOKING THIS HAS KNOWN THIS IS BEEN. THE CASE FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS THIS IS NOTHING NEW. I'M REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT THIS. REALLY CONCERNED EVEN AFTER THE INFORMATIONAL HEARING EVEN EIGHTEEN MONTHS -- POST -- OVER THE REVIEW PANEL AND EVEN TO TO TO GET SOME. THE BEGINNINGS OF WHAT IS GOING TO BE DONE TO CHANGE THIS AND I I'M NOT HEARING ANYTHING BUT I WILL BE GOING WITH WHAT THE STAFF IS RECOMMENDING BUT I I HAVE SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT. JUST THE WAY THE WHOLE DEPARTMENT IS GOING BUT THANK YOU FOR YOUR ANSWERS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR [inaudible] AS GARCIA. THANK YOU SO TO SPEAK FOR A MISTER OF WITH -- MAKING SURE IN THE SENSE THAT YOU EXPECT THAT IN. THE FALL YOU WILL HAVE A STRATEGIC PLAN OF HOW TO REFORM THE DEPARTMENT. THE STRATEGIC PLAN WILL OUTLINE -- OUR WORK ACROSS OUR PROGRAM STITCH TO CONTINUE TO IMPROVE THE THE IMPROVE THE DEPARTMENT. THE FEE PROPOSAL IS NOT EXPECT ME IS IS DELIVERABLE OF IMPLEMENTING THIS REGION'S STRATEGIC PLAN IT'S NOT WE DON'T PUT FORTH THAT PROPOSAL IN THE STRATEGIC PLAN. THIS A AND I WOULD SAY THE STRATEGIC PLAN WILL BE COMING OUT IMMINENTLY IT'S IT'S IT'S AN IT'LL BE BEFORE THE FALL AND SO. WE'VE BEEN WE'VE HAD AN IRA P.. OUT THERE FOR ALMOST TWO YEARS MINIATURE SAID WE'VE HAD BILLS COME THROUGH HERE WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING -- SHORTCOMINGS WITH PTSD FOR AWHILE EXCEPT HAS BEEN AN EXAMPLE FOR US OF OF PLENTY LESSONS FOR US LEARN OF OF WORK WE NEED TO DO. OUT THERE AND SO I'M NOT GOING TO BE HELD WE HAVE TO FALL. PART OF THE RECOMMENDATION LOOKING HERE IS NOT JUST A ONE TIME BACKFILL BUT ALSO SOME REAL REFORM SAID DEPARTMENT. AT IN ON THIS YEAR NOT NEXT YEAR. LET ME PUT THAT ASIDE FOR A SECOND AB HOW TO SAY SOME OF THE PROBLEMS THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE THINGS THAT THE STRATEGIC PLAN SHOULD BE IDENTIFYING SEPARATE FROM THE FEE ISSUE WHAT WOULD BE SOME OF THE THINGS YOU THINK WE NEED TO BE WORKING. ON SO. ONE OF THE OBVIOUS GOALS OF THE STRATEGIC PLAN IS TO COME UP WITH A SUSTAINABLE FUNDING MODEL FOR THE DEPARTMENTS OF SIMILARLY WILL SET THAT ASIDE BECAUSE IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING -- WE HAVE -- A SPECIFIC ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE US GOAL BUILT INTO THAT STRATEGIC PLAN AND A NUMBER OF OBJECTIVES THAT. WILL CONTINUE TO STRENGTHEN OUR IN DROUGHT MEMBER MENTAL JUSTICE WORK ANDA LOOK AT HOW WE CAN. REMOTE EQUITY IN OUR DECISION MAKING -- WE HAVE A GOAL AROUND JUST PERFORMING OUR CORE FUNCTIONS BEING MORE EFFICIENT BRINGING THINGS MODERNIZED MODERNIZING TOOLS AND PRACTICES. OF DOING THINGS LIKE WORKING WITH USEPA TO TAKE THEIR BEST PRACTICES AROUND CLEAN UP AND AND AND MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE USING BEST PRACTICES -- AS WE PLAN AND IMPLEMENT OUR SITE CLEANUPS AND SITE REMEDIATION -- YOU WILL SEE THINGS AROUND COMMUNICATIONS HOW WILL WE COMMUNICATE THAT WITH THING WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS MAKING IT MORE INFORMATION AVAILABLE PROVIDING MORE TRANSPARENCY. ON THEIRS. I COULD GO ON AND DO YOU WANT TO ADD ANY JUST THAT THE THE PLAN ITSELF -- IN IN INCORPORATES FEEDBACK THAT WE'VE BEEN RECEIVING NOT ONLY FROM THE RP BUT FROM OUR COMMUNITY PARTNERS AND OTHER FEEDBACK THAT WE RECEIVED OVER THE YEARS AND WE'VE BEEN. ACTUALLY I'M SPECIFICALLY MAPPING THE ACTION ITEMS THE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES TO THAT BE BACK IN AND PLAN TO DO PUBLIC OUTREACH WITH THE PLAN TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S RESPONSIVE. TO OUR COMMUNITY PARTNER CONCERNED CENTER OTHER STAKEHOLDERS CONCERNS. I ANSWER THAT QUESTION BECAUSE THEY WE KNOW WE WE'VE BEEN ASKING THE SAME CONSTANTLY. OF WHAT ARE THE CHANCES WE NEED TO DO AND AND WE TALKED ABOUT HOW WE NEED TO STREAMLINE THE PERMITTING PROCESS. WE'VE TALKED ABOUT INCLUDING MORE EQUITY AND COMMUNITY BEING PART OF THAT -- THE FEE STRUCTURES. AT THE END OF THE DAY AT MY NUMBER ONE PRIORITY IS KEEPING PEOPLE HEALTHY AND I HAVE A COMMUNITY THAT'S BEEN. PLACE AND WITH MANY THINGS OUT THERE MANY TOXICS OUT THERE. ON AND WORK THAT'S TRYING TO GET DONE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE ENGAGING HAVE BEEN VERY VOCAL ABOUT WHAT THEY WANT FOR AWHILE NOW. IN SO WORRIES ME THAT WE'RE GOING TO SPEND ANOTHER THREE YEARS COMING UP WITH THE PLAN THAT THEN WE WILL IMPLEMENT. VERSUS WE'VE HAD SO MUCH INFORMATION THAT FROM A DISCUSSION THAT I THINK WE COULD DO SOME KEY PILLARS OF THAT REFORM NOW. TO MAKE SURE THAT ADDS THAT GETS MOVED IN IMPLEMENTED MAYBE IF I TAKE A YEAR MOVIES I TAKE TWO YEARS BUT IF WE WAIT TO ADOPT THAT THAT'S GOING TO TAKE THOSE YEARS PLUS WHATEVER IT IS TO IMPLEMENT THAT. IN THE MEANTIME WE HAVE COMMUNITIES I CONTINUE TO BE PLACED IN THE CONTINUE TO BE SICK OUT THERE. I THINK WE HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION OUT THERE TO BE ABLE -- TO PASSING REFORMS NOW I TO ESTABLISH SCHOOLS AROUND EQUITY AROUND FEE STRUCTURES -- AROUND PERMITTING AROUND MAKING SURE NOT ONLY THAT WE'RE PERMITTING BUT WE'RE RETURNING TO THE SITE TO MAKE SURE THAT THINGS ACTUALLY BEING FOLLOWED OR MAYBE THERE'S IMPROVEMENTS ON THE ROAD THAT WE CAN NOW IMPLEMENT. ALONG THE WAY AND SO I THINK WE HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION AT THIS POINT WE HAD ENOUGH THE DISCUSSIONS. I UNDERSTAND THERE YOUR HAVE A MINUTE LONG I UNDERSTAND THAT ARE GOVERNOR HASN'T BEEN THERE THAT LONG BUT I FEEL LIKE. THAT THAT'S NOT ENOUGH OF A REASON NOT TO TAKE ACTION THIS YEAR ON AND NOT TO START TO MOVE THINGS FORWARD I THINK HAVING A BUDGET. BACK FILL FOR ONE YEAR AND THE REALITIES THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO THIS AGAIN ALLOWS US TO COME BACK AND SAY WHAT HAVE WE DONE THIS YEAR FOR REALS AND WHAT THE NEXT THE BERGEN TO TAKE. I SAID A THING LET'S HAVE EVERYTHING FIGURED OUT BECAUSE NO MATTER WHAT TIME WE COME UP WITH FOR HUMAN BEINGS IS NOT GOING TO BE A PERFECT PLAN. BUT I THINK WE REALLY NEED TO BE THINKING ABOUT IN TERMS OF HEALTH. ENTER THE COMMUNITIES AND TERMS OF GENERATIONS OF KIDS THAT WE CONTINUE TO MAKE SIX GENERATIONS THAT MAYBE WE COULD STOP SOONER. OUT THERE AND SO FOR ME I I A SUPPORT THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION -- I LOOK FORWARD TO THE TRAILER BILL OUT THERE -- AND I HOPE THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE DEPARTMENT. OF TOXINS IN THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE COULD COME UP WITH SOME SOLUTIONS THIS YEAR TO MOVE TO MOVE THIS FORWARD TO AND NOT WAIT. ANY FURTHER AND I HOPE THAT WE ARE TAKING THE LESSONS LEARNED I APPRECIATE THE STEPPING BACK ON THE LOAN FROM THE DEBATE THE BATTERY FEET TO HELP. A PIECE OF BACK I APPRECIATE -- THAT WE ARE DISCUSSING THE WORK WE'VE DONE I THINK IN THE DISCUSSION WE COULD EVEN TALK ABOUT THE ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX MILLION DOLLAR LOANS. AND WHETHER OR NOT THAT SHOULD BE ALONE I SHOULD BE A GIFT AT SOME POINT ON AND AND MOVE FORWARD SOMETHING THAT. IS THE LEAST WE COULD DO FOR FOR THESE COMMUNITY SO WE'RE NOT HAVING THIS DISCUSSION IS I THINK THAT THERE HAS BEEN SOME. POSITIVES THIS FORD BUT I WILL SAY HAVING BEEN HERE NOW DISCUSSING THIS FOR ALMOST THIRTY YEARS I DON'T SEE WHY. WE NEED TO WAIT TILL FALL I DON'T SEE WHY WE CAN'T DO SOMEBODY'S BIGGER STRUCTURAL CHANGES NOW -- I SEEK FOLKS IN THE COMMUNITY HERE HAVE BEEN PRETTY WELL CAN I THINK HAVE GIVEN US AND CARE THAT DIRECTION OF THINGS THAT WE COULD BE DOING. NOW TO TO WORKING -- FOR AND SO I JUST WANTED TO REMEMBER THAT IT'S HUMAN HEALTH. AND PEOPLE THAT ARE BEING SICK RIGHT NOW AND I GETTING SICKER AND IT'S COMPOUNDED AND THOSE KIDS THAT ARE GONNA BE BORN INTO THIS AND THAT IF WE WAIT THREE YEARS MORE. ON THAT WE ARE AFFECTING THEIR DEVELOPMENT EVERY STEP OF THE WAY [inaudible] MS RIVAS. I'M FIRST I'D LIKE TO THANK THE STAFF FOR THE WORK THAT IN PREPARING THIS THOROUGH REPORT -- YOU KNOW WE ALL WANT TO SEE CHANGE FROM DTS CA. AND WILL BE PAINTED CLOSE ATTENTION TO PROGRESS YOU KNOW I SHARE THE SENSE OF URGENCY FROM MY COLLEAGUES ON BECAUSE I THINK OF THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE IMPACTED IN A PARTICULAR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR -- UNITIES THAT ARE WAITING TO HEAR FROM US WHAT WE ARE DOING -- YOU KNOW TO MAKE PROGRESS ON THIS ISSUE -- AND SO. THAT'S WILL. WHERE I AM COMING FROM AND I HOPE THAT? NEXT YEAR WHEN YOU COME BACK THAT WE WILL HEAR. AT LEAST SOME PROGRESS FROM THE DEPARTMENT ON AT LEAST ONE THING. THAT YOU HAVE CHANGED -- SO THANK YOU. YOU'RE WELCOME TO SET A HIGHER BAR. IS THERE ANY PUBLIC COMMENT ON THE SIDE OF GET UP GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS INGRID ROSTRUM AND WHAT THE SAN ANDREAS POVERTY IN THE ENVIRONMENT AND WE'VE SPOKEN MANY TIMES. AT OVERSIGHT HEARINGS BUDGET HEARINGS AND COMMITTEE HEARINGS ON THE CHASSIS AND THE NEED FOR REFORM I JUST WANTED TO START WITH A FEW PRINCIPLES -- ONE IS THAT ANY PROGRAMMATIC REDUCTIONS ULTIMATELY IS GOING TO HARM COMMUNITIES. SO WE DO BELIEVE THAT DETAILS HE MUST CONTINUE ON ITS VITAL PROGRAMS AND PERMITTING AND ENFORCEMENT AND CLEAN UPS. SECONDLY. THE POLLUTER PAYS PRINCIPLES. ARE WE DESPERATELY NEED FEE REFORM AND WE NEED TO HAZARDOUS WASTE INDUSTRIES -- AND THE HAZARDOUS WASTE GENERATORS AND THE AND AND THAT THAT THE FOLKS THAT DISPOSE OF HAZARDOUS WASTE. TO BE PAYING. FOR THE COST OF THIS AGENCY RATHER THAN MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WHICH IS WHAT IS BEING ASKED I DO. ON THERE FOR A WHILE WE UNDERSTAND THAT THIS MIGHT BE A STOP GAP -- MEASURE FOR THIS YEAR -- IT MUST NOT BE A BLANK CHECK. WE NEED -- CONDITIONS WE NEED BENCHMARKS ON FROM THE LEGISLATURE TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS A REAL IMPROVEMENT ATTACHED TO THIS. BLANK CHECK THAT IS BEING ASKED. FOR THIS YEAR -- WE REALLY NEED THIS AGENCY TO BE MORE TRANSPARENT MORE COUNTABLE AND MORE RESPONSIVE TO THE COMMUNITY'S WE'VE BEEN. OF PARROTING THIS PHRASE A LOT OVER THE YEARS BUT IT IT REALLY MEANS SOMETHING. ON WE HAVE BEEN ASKING FOR A GOVERNING BOARD OR OR OVERSIGHT BOARD IN THE ABSENCE OF THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW PANEL COMMUNITIES HAVE NOWHERE TO GO -- TO FOR THAT LEVEL OF OVERSIGHT OTHER THAN THE LEGISLATURE AND FRANKLY THAT'S NOT YOUR JOB ARM. IN TERMS OF A AS WE TALKED ABOUT FUNDING GAPS I DO WANT TO ALERT -- AT THE MEMBERS HERE ARE THAT ALREADY THIS PRO THIS DEPARTMENT HAS NOT FULFILLED SOME BASIC THINGS IN TWENTY TWELVE THE POLLUTION PREVENTION PROGRAM AT THE TNC GOT CUT BECAUSE OF LACK OF FUNDING. SO AS WE START LOOKING AT BIG PICTURE REFORMS WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE BIGGER PICTURE IN TERMS OF WHAT IS IN OUR FUTURE IF WE DON'T START REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF HAZARDOUS WASTE. THAT WE CREATE -- WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO HAVE THESE TYPES OF DISCUSSIONS WE WOULD LIKE THE POLLUTION PREVENTION PROGRAM TO BE REFUNDED INCLUDED IN IN IN THE FEE STRUCTURE CONVERSATIONS THAT STEM FROM THIS. ARM THE STATE WHAT HAZARDOUS WASTE MANAGEMENT PLAN -- THE LEGISLATURE ORDER THAT DONE IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES AND NINETEEN NINETIES IT WAS NEVER DONE. AS A STATE WE DON'T KNOW WHERE WE'RE GOING WE DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH WASTE IS BEING GENERATED AND WHERE AND WHERE IT'S GOING TO BE CITED AND LOCATED. SO THAT'S ANOTHER THING THAT WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT AS WE THINK ABOUT THESE LONGER TERM SOLUTIONS. AND FINALLY WERE -- FIFTY FOUR BACK FILLING AND FILLING THE HAZARDOUS WASTE CONTROL ACCOUNT BUT IT WE NEED TO ALSO PAY ATTENTION TO THE TOSCA ACCOUNT. ON I THINK THE STAFF REPORTS HAVE NOTED FOR THE LAST COUPLE YEARS THAT THE DEFICIT IS IMPENDING -- I WOULD SAY THAT THE DECEPTIVE BECAUSE IT IS ALREADY HERE. FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS -- DTS CD HAS ONLY BEEN ABLE TO FIND ABOUT HALF OF THE ORPHAN SITE CLEANUPS IN CALIFORNIA THAT MEANS THAT OTHER HALF. OF THAT CONTAMINATION IS SPREADING AND IS GOING TO COST THE TAXPAYERS AND THE STATE MORE MONEY AS WELL OF COURSE ON THE ULTIMATE. PRICE WHICH IS WITH PRICES TO HUMAN HEALTH ALSO. IN THIS CONVERSATION ALSO SHOULD NOT BE HAPPENING ABSENT A BIG LOOK AT TOSCA AND WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO ABOUT OUR CEANUP OBLIGATIONS AND SPECIFICALLY THOSE OR FRANCE ACT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON OR GOOD EVENING MY NAME IS AN OF US BECAUSE I'M HERE BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA RUNS JUST SLANT SENATE FIRST ONE ECHO THE COMMENTS FOR MY COLLEAGUE FROM SYRUPY. BUT ALSO ONE ECHO -- JUST THE FACT THAT YOU JUST SEEN A BIPARTISAN EFFORTS AND THE QUESTIONS OF FOLKS HAVE BEEN ASKING IT'S REALLY IT'S REFRESHING TO HEAR -- WE'VE BEEN HERE FOR A COUPLE YEARS ASKING FOR THE SAME THINGS I THINK YOU KNOW SOME ASSEMBLY MEMBERS HAVE BEEN HERE ASKING FOR A LITTLE SIMILAR THINGS ANYTHING FOR US IS REALLY HOW DO WE ARE INTENTIONAL PARTNERS A MOVIE FOR IT BECAUSE THEY KNOW WHATEVER HAPPENS THIS YEAR'S NOT. REALLY GOING TO FIX REALLY WHAT THE DEPARTMENT NEEDS AND HOW DO WE ACTUALLY BECOME. REALLY THOSE INDIVIDUALS THAT CAN ACTUALLY HELP YOU THROUGHOUT THAT COME COUPLE YEARS BECAUSE I KNOW SEEN THAT REPORT THAT. ON THE COMMITTEE STAFF PUT TOGETHER IT YOU KNOW THE HAZARDOUS WASTE ACCOUNT IS GOING TO BE IN A DEFICIT TWENTY SEVEN YOU KNOW. TWENTY FIVE MILLION THIS YEAR -- BUT THEN AS SUGGESTED FORTY FOUR MILLION IN NEXT YEAR AND THEN THE THIRTY IS GOING TO BE SIXTY FIVE MILLION BUT EVEN OF THE MONEY HAS BEEN REQUESTED FROM DEPARTMENT NAMING GOING TO BACK FILL US ACCOUNTS. AND SPECIFIC PREVIOUS YEAR SO REALLY LOOKING NOT NOT REALLY FUNDING CURRENT STATUS BECAUSE THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR IS REALLY THINKING ABOUT THIS TRUCK PARTS TRANSFORMED ME. AND MORE THAN AND BE HOW DO WE ACTUALLY WE LOOK AT THIS. IN THE SENSE OF WHO IS ACCOUNTABLE TO HOMES ALLEGE STRICTER HAS BEEN ACCOUNTABLE TO THIS DEPARTMENT AND THE STRUCTURAL CHANGE THAT WE NEED BUT ALSO HOW DO WE EMBED A COMMUNITY. COMPONENT TO THIS AND ALSO A LOT OF C. QUARTERS INCLUDING OUR INDUSTRY PARTNERS WHICH YOU KNOW SOME OF THEM WERE ALWAYS -- YOU KNOW AN OPPOSITE ENDS BUT THIS IS ISSUE THERE WERE PROBABLY THE SAME SIDE ON SOME ITEMS. IN THIS IS A RARE -- JUST VISUAL TO ACTUALLY YOU KNOW WE'RE ASKING FIRST TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY FROM A DEPARTMENT AND WE HAVEN'T BEEN GETTING ON EITHER SIDE SO JUST REALLY THINKING BE MINDFUL THAT I'M REALLY LOOKING AT THE LEGISLATURE IN BOTH ADMINISTRATION TO SEE HOW DO WE ACTUALLY SEE THIS. AS SOMETHING THAT WE DON'T FIX FOR THIS YEAR REALLY LOOKING AT IT FOR THE NEXT TEN YEARS BECAUSE PERSONALLY I CAN BE COMING BACK EVERY YEAR. ASKING FOR THE SAME THING AND I DON'T THINK I'M ASKING THAT FROM A LOT OF OUR MEMBERS COR LITTLE BIT EXHAUSTED OF ACTUALLY SEEING THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER IN A LOT OF IT. IS YOU KNOW A LOT OF THESE MEMBERS ACTUALLY. YOU KNOW RESPONSIBLE TO HIS CONSTITUENCY THOSE CONDITIONS HE ARE ASKING FOR THE SAME THINGS AND AND YOU KNOW AT LEAST WE CAN GET SOME HOPE. I'M AND WE'RE HOPING AFTER YOU KNOW THE WORK ANALYSIS COMES OUT THIS FALL. ON BLISS I WAIT UNTIL THE FALL TO ACTUALLY SEE SOMETHING IF WE CAN ACTUALLY PUT IN PLACE THAT CAN ACTUALLY DEVELOPING ACTUALLY ADD TO THE WORKFORCE ANALYSIS AND REALLY LOOKING AT THE FEE STRUCTURE AND HOW DO WE ACTUALLY LOOK AT THAT SO. WITHOUT LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE ONLY COMPANY IN THE NEXT COUPLE YEARS -- BUT REALLY GETTING THIS APARTMENT RIGHT IT'S NOT FOR ME OR FOR ANYBODY BUT IS REALLY WHAT WE NEED AND ALSO LOOKING AT HOW DO WE ACTUALLY DEAL WITH OUR WASTE. MOVING FORWARD SO WITH THAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU -- IS IF THERE'S NO FURTHER DISCUSSION IS THERE A MOTION TO APPROVE THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION ON ISSUE ONE ON ITEMS TO BE HEARD. THEIR SECOND WHO [inaudible] THANK YOU. BLOOM. HI FONG. GARCIA HI. MULLIN [inaudible] PATTERSON [inaudible] RAY YES [inaudible] RIVAS. THANK YOU WILL MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER TWO ALSO UNDER THE TSC -- THAT WOULD BE A COST RECOVERY A MANAGEMENT SYSTEM GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- WE ARE REQUESTING A ONE TIME AUGMENTATION OF A TWO POINT SIX MILLION SPLIT BETWEEN EACH W. C. A. N. TOSCA IN. NINETEEN TWENTY AND SIX POSITIONS FOR PERMANENT AND TO LIMITED TERM. FOR THE PLANNING A PROJECT PHASES OF THE COST RECOVERY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM I. T. PLATFORM UPGRADE PROJECT. UPGRADING THE THIS PLATFORM IS CRUCIAL BECAUSE THE EXISTING SYSTEM IS NO LONGER SUPPORTED CANNOT BE UPGRADED TO MEET. A CHANGE IN STATUTE AND IS SUBJECT TO SECURITY THREATS. DTS HE RECOVERS MILLIONS IN RESPONSE COSTS ANNUALLY FROM RESPONSIBLE PARTIES AND PERMITTED HAZARDOUS WASTE FACILITIES AND THE COST RECOVERY BILLING SYSTEM SUPPORTS THESE ACTIVITIES. THE NEW SYSTEM WILL PROVIDE THE ABILITY TO TRACK AN ACCOUNT FOR SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS AUTOMATE THE PROCESS FOR ISSUING COLLECTION LETTERS TO BILLABLE PARTY'S. ACCOMMODATE MULTI TIERED INTEREST RATES AS REQUIRED BY AB. TWO SEVENTY THREE IMPROVE DTS HE'S ABILITY TO IDENTIFY AND REPORT ON DELINQUENT INVOICES AND TIMELY ISSUE COLLECTION LETTERS. AND IMPROVE ON ONLINE FUNCTIONALITY INCLUDING ENABLING BILLABLE PARTIES THE ABILITY TO VIEW OR RUN REPORTS THAT REFLECT THEIR INVOICING OR PAYMENT HISTORY. IDOL IMPROVE THE OVERALL FUNCTIONALITY INCLUDING THE ABILITY TO QUICKLY RESEARCH RECONCILING THE JUST COSTS. IN FINALLY IT WILL IMPROVE COST RECOVERY CASE MANAGEMENT AND WORK FOR THE TRACK ACTIONS ON SITES WITH UNREIMBURSED COSTS. IN THE PAST THE LACK OF CASE MANAGEMENT HAS HAMPERED EFFECTIVE COST RECOVERY. WE'VE CHOSEN A SOLUTION THAT PROVIDES A CAT COST EFFECTIVE KNOWN STRATEGY MEETS LEGISLATIVE COST RECOVERY INTEREST RATES. INTEREST RATE MANDATES OF AB TWO SEVENTY THREE AN ALLIANCE WITH CALLIE PA'S INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY STRATEGIC PLAN TO LEVERAGE EXISTING TECHNOLOGY AND SOLUTIONS. AND FINALLY THE SELECTED SOLUTION MINIMIZES SECURITY THREATS. THE PLANNING PHASE STAGE FOUR OF THE PROJECT APPROVAL LIFECYCLE IS ESTIMATED TO BE COMPLETED IN AUGUST OF TWENTY NINETEEN WE WERE APPRECIATE THE RECOMMENDATION TO APPROVE AS PROPOSED AND ADOPTED BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE THAT WOULD MAKE THE RELEASE OF FUNDS CONTINGENT ON DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY AND% FINANCE APPROVAL. BUT WOULD ASK THAT 200-909-4000 DOLLARS BE IMMEDIATELY APPROVED FOR THE COMPLETION OF STAGE FOR WHICH IS ESTIMATED TO BE COMPLETED IN AUGUST. OF TWENTY NINETEEN I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS -- I WANTED TO ASK FOR CLARIFICATION ON WHAT YOU WERE ASKING FOR THESE OF THE THE TWENTY TWO HUNDRED NINETY FOUR THOUSAND YOU READ THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION AND THE STAFF REPORT THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION I THOUGHT WAS IT. THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION REFLECTS THAT ASK AND IT IS -- MOST OF THE REQUESTED THAT TO NINETY FOUR IS BUDGETED AND THEN THE TWO POINT TWO EIGHT FOUR MILLION AS REFLECTED IN THE LA -- AND STAFF RECOMMENDATION WOULD BE CONTINGENT I ASSUME THAT I POLITICS I DIDN'T SEE THE TWO NINETY FOUR SPELLED OUT SO. I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE OF THAT WAS CLEAR -- I THINK THE LA -- HAS SOME COMMENTS SHAMA WITH LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE TO ENSURE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT WE'RE RECOMMENDING THE BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE THAT YOU SEE THERE THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION IN YOUR AGENDA. RIGHT ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS MISS REYES. MAYBE I'M MISSING SOMETHING BUT WARRANT WE DEALING WITH UPDATING A NO LONGER SUPPORTED. SOFTWARE. THAT IS TO TEN YEARS. THE FOR TEN YEARS THIS IS BEEN. OVER TEN YEARS LATER ON THIS WHERE WE NOW. JUST DEVELOPING A PROJECT PLAN TO ADDRESS THIS. I'M LIKE I CAN'T SPEAK -- TO MMHM. YOU KNOW LONG RANGE HISTORY BUT I CAN SPEAK TO YOU KNOW WE UNDERSTAND NOW THAT THE THE SYSTEM NEEDS TO BE UPDATED AND AND THAT WE NEED ADDITIONAL FUNCTIONALITY IN ORDER TO MEET. MEET OUR COST RECOVERY -- GOALS AND AND PLANS AND SO AND WE'VE BEEN ENGAGED IN THIS PROCESS FOR A FEW YEARS ACTUALLY TO TO UPDATE IT ACTUALLY -- SEVERAL YEARS AGO IT WAS ANTICIPATED THAT THE NEW THIS CAL SYSTEM WOULD INCLUDE FUNCTIONALITY -- THAT WOULD -- ENABLE -- THAT THAT THIS CAL SYSTEM TO TAKE CARE OF THIS PARTICULAR AND BUSINESS PROCESS FOR US AND ONCE THERE WAS SOME ANALYSIS DONE IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE SCALP COULDN'T -- INCLUDE THIS PARTICULAR FUNCTIONALITY AND SO WE BEGAN THE PROCESS THE PROJECT APPROVAL PROCESS OF OF ANALYZING THE VARIOUS SOLUTIONS TO REPLACE THE SYSTEM SO -- I THINK WE'RE SEEING SOME DELAYS BECAUSE WE ANTICIPATED FISCALE WOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE OVER THE FUNCTIONALITY. ARE WE REPLACING OR WE UPDATING. WE ARE UPGRADING THE PLATFORM ORIGINALLY WE ACTUALLY WERE -- ANTICIPATING REPLACING IT AND AFTER FORM WOULD GET US TO THE SAME OBJECTIVE BUT IN A MORE COST EFFECTIVE AND TIMELY WAY. IN THE ANALYSIS IF I MAY UM WAS CHAIRED THE ANALYSIS. FOR THE THE THE ITEM JUST BEFORE TO DTS SEE FAILED TO COLLECT AN ESTIMATED ONE HUNDRED NINETY FOUR MILLION CLEANUP COSTS. FROM POLLUTERS SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN PHIL TO SEND OUT NEARLY ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO MILLION AND BILLS. AND FOR THE FIFTY TWO MILLION IN ASSESSMENTS. DTS HE DID MAIL BUT NEVER COLLECTED. WHAT'S GOING TO CHANGE. WELL THE LEGISLATURE -- PROVIDED US WITH RESOURCES TO DO A THOROUGH ANALYSIS OF OUR COST RECOVERY -- PROCESS SEES IN WE IMPLEMENTED A COST RECOVERY WORK PLAN -- TO REENGINEER OUR BUSINESS PROCESS SEES -- ADDITIONALLY LAST YEAR THE LEGISLATURE GRANTED ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO ASSIST WITH AND THE MOST IN TRANSGENIC INTRANSIGENT -- COST RECOVERY CASES -- WE'VE ACTUALLY REDUCE STAR AMOUNT OF UNREIMBURSED COSTS FROM HISTORICAL LEVEL OF SEVEN POINT SIX MILLION TO TWO MILLION ANNUALLY -- AND WE'VE ALSO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF ORIGINAL SITES OUT OF THE AUDIT THAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO WHICH WAS THE STATE AUDITOR AUDIT. WE'VE REDUCED -- THE NUMBER OF SITES -- FROM AND ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND TWENTY ONE TO A HUNDRED AND THIRTY SEVEN AND THAT'S FROM THAT TWENTY FIVE YEAR BACKLOG PERIOD THAT ENDED DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST -- TWENTY TWELVE AND IT'S THE RECOMMENDATION OF THE LA -- THAT WE UPGRADE. THIS OUTDATED SOFTWARE PROGRAM. YES WE HAD ART IT EXPELLED LOOK AT THIS PROPOSAL AND THAT IS OUR RECOMMENDATION. VERY GOOD THANK YOU [inaudible] YOUR PHONE. JUST A QUICK QUESTION SINCE YOU YOU BROUGHT UP THIS GALLON THE THE IN OPERABILITY OF THE TWO SO IS FISCALE. STILL WORKING ON SOMETHING TO ADDRESS THIS OR ARE YOU JUST CREEK -- HIS NOW THE PATH THAT YOU'RE GOING FORWARD IS TO CREATE A PROGRAM INDEPENDENT OF FISCAL TO DO THIS. THE ORIGINAL INTENT WAS ON THE ORIGINAL FOUGHT AND I DON'T WANT TO TESTIFY ON BEHALF OF THIS GAL BUT AND THE ORIGINAL THOUGHT WAS THAT THE FUNCTIONALITY IN THE SYSTEM WOULD BE ABLE -- TO MANAGE THIS PARTICULAR BUSINESS PROCESS. I'M AND AFTER SOME FURTHER ANALYSIS IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE SYSTEM ACTUALLY ISN'T GOING TO BE CONFIGURED TO COVER THIS BUSINESS PROCESS AND SO WE BEGAN -- PURSUING OUR OWN UPGRADE -- OF THE OF THE SYSTEM SO I IMAGINE AND I'M NOT A TECHNICAL PERSON AND  DO HAVE MY CHAU HERE BUT THERE WILL BE SOME -- CERTAINLY SOME -- INTERFACE BETWEEN FISCALE AND THE SYSTEM IT'S JUST THAT THIS PARTICULAR BUSINESS PROCESS IS GOING TO OCCUR OUTSIDE OF THE FISCAL SYSTEM. SO OKAY SO THE SO I'M JUST I'M JUST MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT DUPLICATING EFFORT WERE FISCAL STILL TRYING TO DO SOMETHING THAT YOU GUYS ARE STILL CHAO ITSELF WHERE WE WE HAVE BEEN -- WE'VE HAD YEARS OF OF MEETINGS WITH THE SCALE IN IN TALKING ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE -- TO TRY AND SEE IF WE COULD -- INCLUDED WITHIN THE FUNCTIONALITY -- IN THOSE IS ANY FISCAL SAY THAT IT CAN'T BE DONE. RIGHT THEY THEY INDICATED THAT IT WOULD BE -- IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE STATE FOR US TO PURSUE UPGRADING OUR SYSTEM THAK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS IS THERE PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS ITEM. SEEING NONE WE ARE -- ASKED TO APPROVE THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION THAT IS -- DETAILED IN THE AIR GENDER IS THERE A MOTION TO APPROVE THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION. HELLO THANK YOU HI FONG. BY GARCIA.
