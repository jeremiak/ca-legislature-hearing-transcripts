THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. AND MEMBERS. TODAY I PRESENT TO YOU AB SIXTY FIVE WHICH IS A COMMON SENSE MEASURE AIMED AT PROTECTING OUR COMMUNITIES AND LOWERING EXPOSURE TO COPE WITH NINETEEN SPECIFICALLY EXPOSURES IN THE WORKPLACE. CURRENTLY THERE IS NO LAW THAT MANDATES THAT EMPLOYERS NOTIFYING WORKERS OF POTENTIAL COVERT NINETEEN EXPOSURE IN THE WORKPLACE. IT IS CLEAR THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS GONE ABOVE AND BEYOND TO ENSURE OUR EMPLOYEES AND MEMBERS HERE IN THE CAPITAL ARE SAFE AND PROTECTED. UNFORTUNATELY NOT ALL EMPLOYEES IN THE STATE HAVE THAT LUXURY OR ACCOMMODATION. EVERY DAY OUR CENTRAL WORKERS ARE RISKING THEIR LIVES AND THE LIVES OF THEIR LOVED ONES WHENEVER THEY GO TO WORK TO KEEP OUR STATE FUNCTIONING WE MUST DO EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER AS A GOVERNING BODY TO ENSURE OUR ESSENTIAL WORKERS ARE PROTECTED. CURRENT LAW REQUIRES THAT EMPLOYERS REPORT FATALITIES AND SERIOUS INCIDENTS. BUT IT IS ONLY RECOMMENDED THAT EMPLOYERS REPORT ON COBIT NINETEEN INFECTIONS. THERE IS NO COMPREHENSIVE MANDATE TO REPORT EXPOSURES AND CASES. PUBLICLY FOR TRACKING PURPOSES THIS BILL CREATES SIMPLE AND CLEAR GUIDELINES FOR WHAT EMPLOYERS SHOULD DO WHEN HE OR SHE IS INFORMED THAT SOMEONE AT WORK IT HAS TESTED POSITIVE OR BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH COPD NINETEEN. IT ALLOWS ONE BUSINESS DAY TO NOTIFY WORKERS WHO WERE ON THE PREMISES WITH THE PERSON WHO HAS COVERT NINETEEN. THAT NOTICE SHOULD TELL WORKERS WHAT TYPE OF SICK LEAVE THEY MAY BE ELIGIBLE FOR AND THE DISINFECTION AND SAFETY PLAN FOR THE WORKSITE. IF THREE WORKERS TEST POSITIVE WITHIN FOURTEEN DAYS WHICH IS A PUBLIC HEALTH DEFINITION OF AN OUTBREAK. THE EMPLOYER MUST REPORT TO LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS. THAT IS THE EXTENT OF THE EMPLOYER OBLIGATION. TO SIMPLE REQUIREMENTS TO LIMIT WORKSITE SPREAD AND PREVENT WORKERS FROM BRINGING THE VIRUS HOME TO VULNERABLE FAMILY MEMBERS. IN ADDITION THIS BILL REQUIRES A STATE PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT TO TRACK EMPLOYER OUTBREAKS SO THAT WE CAN WORK WITH STATE AND LOCAL ENTITIES TO ENSURE WORKERS ARE PROTECTED AND UNDERSTAND TRENDS OVER TIME. I'M HERE TO TESTIFY- REMOTELY IN SUPPORT OF OUR CAITLIN VEGA WITH UFC W. AND SARA FLOCKS WITH CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND WE DO HAVE YOU HAVE THE WITNESSES ONLINE I WANT TO BE KEEPING TIME UP HERE AGAIN MAXIMUM FOUR MINUTES TOTAL OF BETWEEN THE TWO WITNESSES SO. WE CAN GO AHEAD AND BEGIN. WITH MISS SURVEY A- NUMBER EIGHT THEN DATA ON BEHALF OF THE U. S. SIXTY LEFT. OUT TO BE COACHED FONG THAT MATCH AND WE THINK ASSEMBLY RAY YES HER LEADERSHIP AS WELL AS THE LATINO CAUCUS FOR MAKING THIS BILL A PRIORITY. AND WHAT WE HAVE SEEN UP AND DOWN THE STATE OUR WORK SITE CLUSTERS WORK LARGE NUMBERS OF WORKERS HAVE BEEN EXPOSED AT THE WORK SITE WHERE THEY HAVE NOT BEEN NOTIFIED OF COVERT INFECTION AT THE WORK SITE IN MANY CASES THEY HAVE GONE HOME TO THEIR FAMILIES. AND THEIR FAMILIES THANK- SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T KNOW THAT THEY HAD BEEN EXPOSED- OUTWORK IN ADDITION WE HAVE VERY LITTLE ABILITY TO TRACK THESE WORKSITE OUTBREAKS WHICH MEANS THAT WE CAN'T DIRECT THE KINDS OF RESOURCES THAT WE NEED WE CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT KIND OF SAFETY PROTOCOLS ARE WORKING WHERE ENFORCEMENT RESOURCES SHOULD BE TARGETED WE'RE TESTING SHOULD BE MADE AVAILABLE. THERE IS SIMPLY A LACK OF INFORMATION ABOUT THE ROLE OF WORKSITE SPREAD AND THIS HAS BEEN CATASTROPHIC PUTS THE LATINO COMMUNITY. BUT YOU KNOW IMMIGRANTS ARE OVER REPRESENTED IN INDUSTRIES LIKE AGRICULTURE MEAT PACKING PLANTS- POULTRY PLANTS LIKE FOSTER FARMS THAT WE SAW OVER THE WEEKEND HAD ALMOST FOUR HUNDRED WORKERS- WHO HAD COATED EIGHT HAVE ALREADY PASSED AWAY- AND- SO. BECAUSE OF THE FAILURE TO TRACKWORK SITES BUT OR CONTROL IT WE HAVE SEEN THIS GROW UNABATED WITHIN LATINO COMMUNITY WHO NOW REPRESENT MORE THAN 60% OF CASES IN CALIFORNIA. THE POOL OF THIS BILL IS VERY SIMPLE IS MINIMAL PROTECTIONS TO REDUCE BURKE SAID SPREAD NOTICE TO THE WORKER THAT MAY HAVE BEEN EXPOSED AND NOTICE TO PUBLIC HEALTH WHEN THERE HAD BEEN AN OUT. BUT THEY'RE THE ONLY OBLIGATION ON EMPLOYERS UNDER THE STUFF. WE HAD ENGAGE WITH THE PLAYERS FROM THE BEGINNING- WE DO BELIEVE THAT AS A WORKER SAFETY CRISIS WE HAVE A GREAT SENSE OF URGENCY AND YET WE HAVE HAD. MANY MANY MANY MEETINGS WITH THE OPPOSITION AND TAKEN A SIGNIFICANT. AMENDMENTS ON EVERY PROVISION OF THE STILL TO MAKE SURE THAT IT IS SIMPLE AND CLEAR IMPLEMENTED. FOR THE PLAY AND AT THE SAME WE REALLY FEEL LIKE WE ARE TRYING TO LIVES HERE AND WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE THAT WORK HAVE THE RIGHT TO GO SAFE TO THEIR FAMILY AT THE ENDOF THE DAY. AND SO WITH THAT WE ASK FOR YOUR IPHONE. THANK YOU. I MISS FOX. ONE MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS SERRA FLOCK TO THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION A PROUD CO SPONSOR OF THIS BILL- ASSEMBLY WOMAN RAY AS RELEASED I'M BEST AT BUT THIS IS A BILL THAT IS NOT ABOUT SHAMING ANY EMPLOYER THIS IS A BILL ABOUT FEEDING WORKERS LIVES AND ABOUT PREVENTING OUTBREAKS BEFORE THEY SPREAD IT REALLY IS SO THAT LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT. THE PUBLIC WORKERS AND STATE POLICYMAKERS HAVE THE INFORMATION THAT THEY NEED SO THEY CAN INTERVENE AT WORKSITE BEFORE OUTBREAKS GET OUT OF CONTROL AND I CAN BE WHAT THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH DID IN SHUTTING DOWN FOSTER FARMS HE COULD BE SAYING OKAY WE HAVE THREE CASES AT THIS WORK SITE WE'RE GONNA GET MOBILE TESTING THERE WE'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY HAS THE RESOURCES THAT THEY NEED AND THE HEALTHCARE THAT THEY NEED. THIS REALLY IS THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE WAY WE CAN THINK OF TO TAKE THE STRAPPED RESOURCES THAT OUR PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT AND CAL OSHA HAVE AND DIRECT THEM TO THE PLACES WHERE WE CAN BE MOST EFFECTIVE AND SO WE THINK THAT IS A GREAT BELL AND THE AMENDMENTS REALLY TIGHTEN IT UP AND. WE WOULD URGE YOUR ITEM THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IS THERE ANYONE IN THE ROOM. TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT. IF NOT IS THERE ANYONE THAT IS ON- THE LINE IN SUPPORT.

I'LL TRY THAT IT YOU FEEL FREE TO ADD ON A YEAH ANYWAY HAVE A PERFORMANCE. IN RECORD WITH YOUR FOR CALCHAMBER OPPOSED TO AB SIXTY FIVE AND I WOULD SAY I THINK ON BEHALF OF A BROAD COALITION WE WERE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE BILL'S REQUIREMENT THAT. ARE COST EFFECTIVE ACROSS ALL TYPES OF PLAYERS ACROSS ALL INDUSTRIES REGIONS AND SIZES IN THE STATE BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE AND THE PRESS THAT COALITION I THINK IT'S AN EXAMPLE OF THE FACT THAT ARE A BIT RATHER DEMONSTRATIVE FACT THAT THE TEXT OF THE BILL. JEFF HAD HUGE IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES- I'D LIKE TO THANK THE OFFICE OFFICE FOR LINKING GATE AND PROP THAT AT AS WE STATED PREVIOUSLY BUT WE BELIEVE THIS BILL STILL CONTAINS ALL THE TECHNICAL ISSUES AND SO WE REMAIN. OPPOSED TO BE CLEAR. WE NOT YEARS DOWN PAY THE TO COOK NINETEEN WE'RE NOT OF. TO PROVIDE NOTICE. TO EMPLOYEES THE EVENT EXPOSURE IF THAT WAS ALL THE BILL DID THEN DID WE DO HAVE A DIFFERENT DISCUSSION- BUT I'LL GIVE YOU TWO EXAMPLES THAT THE TEXTUAL ISSUES THAT REMAIN IN THE- BILL TO THE DAY. AND NEED TO BE FIXED SO THAT IT'S WORKABLE- FIRST THE BILL IS VAGUE STILL AT THE DESPITE THE MULTIPLE ROUNDS EVENT. AT UKHRUL MUST RECEIVE NOTICE AND WHAT NOTED THEY MUST. YOUR SEATS. AN EXAMPLE THE BILL I PROVIDE FOR THREE SET OF DOC HE- TO AVOID- I NOTICED THE CLOSURE A SET OF LABOR DOCUMENT AND THEN ALSO THAT A CLEANING PAUL. I THINK THIS IS AN ERROR BUT PRESENT THE BILL ACTUALLY THE DIFFERENT DEFINITIONS FOR WHO GETS EACH OF THOSE DOCUMENTS. AND SOME OF THE DIFFERENT DEFINITIONS ARE COMPLETELY UNDEFINED SO ONE OF THE THAT THE DOCUMENT GOES TO ANYONE WHO WAS EXPOSED. BUT THE BILL DOESN'T DEFINE WHO WAS EXPOSED ANOTHER THAT GOES TO THE GROUP ON THE WORK THAT AT THE TIME WHICH MAKES SENSE. THE THIRD THAT WILL BE SENT OUT A COMPANYWIDE WITHIN TWENTY WITHIN ONE BUSINESS DAY WHATEVER THAT MAY EXPOSURE I GET I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE OFFICE INTENT. BUT I THINK THAT WILL CLEAR TEXTUAL ERRORS THAT THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HERE I TRY TO COMPLY WITH. WORLD SPACE HELLO SHE CANNOT. BUT I KNOW THE OFFICE. SIX INTEREST IN CLEANUP LANGUAGE NOW YEAR. BUT I'D BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T FLAG THE ISSUE THAT WE BREAK THE LAW. A SECOND ISSUE IS THAT THE BILL HAS A LONG STANDING ISSUE WITH THE DEFINITION OF A POSITIVE CASE DOCTOR PAN RATE THIS ISSUE WITH THAT LABOR THE BILL QUICKLY PROVIDE THAT- LAB CONFIRMED CASES THE CODE NINETEEN WILL TRIGGER NOTICE BUT AS DR PANDA BEAR LAB CONFIRMED CASES CAN BE CHAU EITHER ACTIVE VIRUS OR ANTIBODY REQUIRED SECTION AND WE NEED TO FOCUS ON ACTIVE BUYERS THIS BILL DOESN'T DIFFERENTIATE. THE ONE THING OFF LIKE BRIEFLY THEN I'LL BE DONE IT IS THE BILL DOES CREATE A PUBLICATION REQUIREMENT TO THE PUBLIC- AND THERE WAS DISCUSSION ABOUT SHARING MENTION BUT LIKE TO BE CLEAR ABOUT WHY WE THINK THAT PUBLICATION AGREEMENT THAT WOULD HELP THE BATTLE REPORT TO T. P. H. THEY'LL TAKE THEM HOW THE PRODUCT THAT THEY WILL BE POSTED THAT THE DATA COMES OUT A WEEK TO TWO WEEKS LATER ON THEIR WEBSITE FOR SPECIFIC WORKS THAT- THAT DATA BY THE TIME IT IS POSTED THE TICKET POLICE WILL BE OUT OF. OUR THE WORKSITE THE WORK THAT WILL HAVE BEEN CLEAN AT THE DANGER THERE NOW LIKE IT MEDICALLY CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS THE FOSTER FARMS YOU'VE ALL HEARD ABOUT THAT WE CERTAIN CASES WITH HUGE PROBLEMS FOR MOST EMPLOYERS BY THE TALENT THAT IT POSTED IT WILL HAVE BEEN DEALT BUT WHAT WILL HAPPEN IS A PARTICULAR GROUP OR SMALLER BUSINESSES RESTAURANTS AND OTHERS THAT HAVE TO WORK WITH CUSTOMERS. THERE WILL BE HANGING INFORMATION ONLINE ABOUT PRIOR CASES WHICH WILL PROFESSOR IS THE ULTIMATE NO ONE COMING IN UNDERSTANDABLY THAT WILL KILL THE BUSINESSES OF ENTERPRISE RESTAURANT POLITICS REALLY STRUGGLE TO FILL AYE RIGHT NOW THAT'S SOMETHING. THAT THE HUGE CONCERN TO US. GIVE A SHORT THAT WE ARE OPPOSED TO COURT THE BILL WE REALLY THINK THAT IT MOVED TO. THAT YEAR THERE. CONCERN ALL TAX. INQUIRED AND A COUPLE POLICIES. AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE- THE- HOPE WE BUTTON FOR ME. THOSE FINE YOU PRITCHARD. OKAY IS THERE ANYONE IN THE ROOM AND UP. RIGHT IF NOT IF WE CAN GO OVER TO THE- THE PHONE LINE.

MISTER CHAIR THERE ARE NO OTHER PARTS QUEUED UP AT THIS TIME OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF A BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS MOST. WITH THE MOST A SECOND. THANK YOU HAVE SUPPORT YES IS RIGHT SURE. THANK YOU A CHAIR CREATE THAT NEVER BRING IN THIS- I DO RISE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS AND I WASN'T ACTUALLY. REALLY SURE THAT THIS WAS GOING DIRECTLY AT FOSTER FARMS WHICH IS ONE OF THE BEST. AND LARGEST EMPLOYERS M. IN MY DISTRICT ND IT'S ACTUALLY VERY SAD THAT THIS OUTBREAK HAS HAPPENED TO THEM. BUT THIS IS A BUSINESS THAT HAS DONE. PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING THEY'VE BEEN ASKED TO DO AND HAS FAR EXCEEDED WHAT THE STATE HAS MANDATED. SO I WOULD JUST ARGUE. THAT THIS IS A FAILURE. OF MERCED COUNTY PAHO AND THEIR INABILITY TO GET THE RESOURCES THAT ARE BUSINESSES NEED TO DO THE TESTING THAT IS REQUIRED FOR FACILITIES THAT ARE THIS LARGE AND I DON'T KNOW THE EXACT NUMBER AND I WAS TRYING TO GET THOSE NUMBERS BEFORE I SPOKE WITH A JUST MOVED A LITTLE BIT QUICKER ON HOW MANY TESTS THAT THEY HAD DONE. PRIOR TO THIS OUTBREAK AND SO IT IS FRUSTRATING THERE'S A LITTLE BIT IRRITATING BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND THE NEED AND NONE OF US WANT OUTBREAKS ESPECIALLY IN LARGE BUSINESSES BECAUSE THESE ARE GENERATIONAL JOBS WE HAVE MULTIPLE GENERATIONS OF THE SAME FAMILY WORKING AT THIS PARTICULAR TIME FAMILY OWNED BUSINESS AND THEY'RE INCREDIBLY- WELL PAID AND IT'S WHY THEY KEEP COMING BACK TO WORK THERE AND SO IT IS VERY VERY UNFORTUNATE BUT I AM ACTUALLY. KIND OF FOLLOWING THIS LAST FEW WEEKS AND HOUSES DEVELOPED. WE ARE THE STATE AND AT THE COUNTY LEVEL EXPRESSLY WITH THE MANDATE SO WE'RE PUTTING ON OUR BUSINESSES LAST WEEK WE HAVE AN OUTBREAK IN THE SENATE RIGHT BUT IT WAS A LIAR OUR SENATE COLLEAGUES ARE QUARANTINED IN THEIR APARTMENTS RIGHT NOW I ROOM WITH ONE. I TRY TO GET TESTED. AND I WAS TOLD I DIDN'T HAVE TO. OKAY SO THIS IS A HUGE FRUSTRATION THAT WE HAVE BECAUSE THERE'S NO CONSISTENCY AT THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVELS WE HAVE NO. WE JUST NO CONSISTENCY SO IT IS INCREDIBLY FRESH AND WE HOLD OUR BUSINESS COMMUNITY TO A STANDARD. BUT WE DON'T REALLY TAKE IT TO HEART AND SO I WOULD JUST WANT TO PUT OUT THERE THAT I AM. I'M UPSET THAT THIS HAPPENED TO ONE OF THE BEST BUSINESSES THAT WE HAVE. IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND CERTAINLY. THE LARGEST EMPLOYER IN OUR REGION SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU. SUMMER GONZALEZ I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT THIS BILL WAS IN THE WORKS BEFORE UNFORTUNATELY WHAT WE FOUND OUT FOSTER FARMS AND WITH ALL DUE RESPECT AND I RESPECTED BUSINESS. AT A UNIONIZED WILL PAIN BUSINESS IN YOUR DISTRICT BUT THIS IS WHAT WE NOW THERE WERE STATE REGULATORS THERE IN JUNE THEY GAVE THEM- SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS ON THINGS THAT COULDBE DONE THOSE WERE IGNORED. EIGHT PEOPLE ARE DEAD DEAD. BECAUSE OF THAT. I I'M SORRY. IT'S NOT AN INCONVENIENCE WHEN THE PEOPLE WHO ARE DYING OUR FROM OUR COMMUNITY TIME AND TIME AGAIN. WHETHER IT'S A PROCESSING FACILITY OR WHETHER IT'S A FAMILY FARM OR WHETHER IT'S A LARGE INDUSTRIAL FARM WE ARE LOSING OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS BECAUSE RULES ARE NOT FOLLOWED. THEY WERE TOLD TO SHUT DOWN BY COUNTY HEALTH AND THEY DID NOT DO SO FOR TWO DAYS BECAUSE THEY NEEDED TO GET THE HARVEST OUT WOULD HARVEST IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE LIVES OF WORKERS THAT WE DON'T SEE OR HEAR. SOMETHING IS WRONG THIS WAS NOT ABOUT FOSTER FARMS BUT THIS IS ABOUT EVERY EMPLOYER WHO IS TAKING THE RISK ON BEHALF OF THEIR EMPLOYEES AS THEY KNOW THERE'S A BREAKOUT. AND THEY REFUSED TO TELL OTHER WORKERS THAT THERE'S AN OUTBREAK IN THEIR FACILITY BEING KNOW IT EXISTS THEY REFUSE TO TELL THEM. THEY DO NOT TELL THEM THE RIGHTS WERE WORKING WITH PEOPLE WHO DON'T EVEN REALIZE THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO STAY HOME. WHO ARE BATTLING BECAUSE THEY CAN'T ACCESS ANY KIND OF HELP OUTSIDE OF THE FACILITY BECAUSE MANY TIMES UNDOCUMENTED. THAT IS THE TRUTH IT IS AN UNCOMFORTABLE TRUTH BUT IT HAS DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED LATINO COCKETT THE LATINO COMMUNITY AND THAT'S WHY IT'S A PRIORITY BILL. AND I GET IT. IT'S DISCOURAGING BECAUSE TESTING SHOULD BE BETTER IN THE STATE SHOULD HAVE. A BETTER HANDED THAT WE'RE ASKING FOR THAT AS WELL BUT THE pTO ONE TELL OTHER EMPLOYEES WHEN THERE'S AN OUTBREAK TO TELL THEM OF THE RIGHT TO BE ABLE TO STAY HOME IF THEY'RE SICK. TELL THEM OF THE RIGHTS OF THE OF THE THEIR ABILITY TO QUARANTINEWHEN THEY NEED TO L. WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO LOSE LIVES REAL LIVES. BECAUSE IT'S INCONVENIENT FOR AN EMPLOYER SO. I GET IT AND I DON'T WANT TO ARGUE WITH YOU MISTER. FLOOR I MEAN I UNDERSTAND. EMPLOY ARE JUST NEED A LOT TO US. BUT ALL I CAN SAY IS THIS JUST BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW THESE INDIVIDUAL WORKERS AND I'M ASKING YOU PERSONALLY AND I KNOW YOU YOU CARE I KNOW YOU CARE ABOUT WORKERS BUT NOT. BUT WE IS A STATE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ACCEPT. DEATH AFTER DEATH AFTER DEATH FUND IN THE WORKPLACE OF LATINO PRIMARILY IMMIGRANT WORKERS BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW THEM. THEY'RE NOT REAL TO US IN THIS IS WHERE IT STOPS IN SOUTH. I RESPECTFULLY. I AM. VOTING FOR IT I HOPE EVERYBODY VOTES FOR IT BUT EMPLOYERS ALSO HAVE TO TAKE THE RESPONSIBILITY. AND IT WILL NOT HURT YOU THANK YOU THE RESULTS YET. THEY WILL NOT BE IN ARE YOU BECAUSE WE HAVE A GREAT REALLY BUT- I DO WANT TO MAKE SURE LIKE MY FRUSTRATION IS. WE AS THE STATE WE DO THIS RIGHT BUT WE DON'T HOLD OURSELVES. ACCOUNTABLE AS WELL. LIKE WEEK WE THROW ALL THIS OUT THERE WE THROW THE PLAN WE DO ALL THESE THINGS. BUT WE ARE NOT GIVING OUR BUSINESS TO BE THE RESOURCES. TO DO THEIR JOBS AS WELL. AND SO IT ALL DROPS BACK ON THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY AND THEN WHEN THINGS IMPLODE OR THINGS GO WRONG. THEY ARE REALLY REALLY IN A TOUGH SPOT AND SO YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT I MEAN I GREW UP WITH MIGRANT WORKERS AT A HUGE PART OF MY LIFE. AND WE HAVE TO FIGHT FOR THEM ON A DAILY BASIS. MY FRUSTRATION IS FAR MORE WITH THE STATE THAN ANYTHING ELSE. I AM SORRY I HOPE YOU'LL JOIN ME WE ARE PUSHING THE GOVERNOR WE GOT A COMMITMENT BECAUSE- THE- HAPPY. WORKERS BILL THAT WE'RE GOING TO VOTE ON TODAY ALSO LEAVES OUT THE FACT THAT THESE WORKERS ARE NOT BEING TESTED IN AN- OUTBREAK CANNOT BE DETERMINED WE ARE DEMANDING. THAT THESE WORKERS GET TESTING THAT THEY NEED FROM THE STATE IN THE STATE'S RESPONSIBILITY I HOPE YOU'LL FIND THAT LETTER WITH LATINO CAUCUS. THAT THIS IS NOT JUST THE EMPLOYER IT IS ALSO THE STATE AND WE'VE GOT TO DO THIS. BECAUSE WE HAVE TO FIND OUT WHERE THE CONTACT IS FROM. RIGHT THAT'S WHAT CONTACT TRACING ALL ABOUT. I'M GLAD THAT. WE'VE COME TO SOME AGREEMENT THAT WE ALL CAN AGREE ON ANYONE ELSE. FROM THE CAN COMMITTEE. AND YOU KNOW I AGREE WITH EVERYTHING I COLLEAGUES SAID- AND ULTIMATELY THOSE ARE AND WE HAVE TO DO BETTER AS A STATE AND I THINK EVERYONE. AGREES WITH THAT THAT BEING SAID PROTECTING THESE WORKERS THAT- IS ESSENTIAL FOR US TO DO IS THE BARE MINIMUM IS A LEASE THAT WE SHOULD DO IT AND DINNER TO THE VICE YEARS POINT. HAVING THIS DATA HAVING THIS INFORMATION OUT QUICKLY WILL ALLOW US TO RESPOND MUCH MORE QUICKLY AND AS I'VE MENTIONED BEFORE A BENCH ON THE FLOOR YOU KNOW I'M AND I'M I LIVE IN SOUTH OF THE CAPITAL SILICON VALLEY IN THE BAY AREA. THE CENSUS TRACTS OF THE MOST DEATHS IN THE AREA OF MY DISTRICT. THE SIZE SAN JOSE. HOW THE LATINO THESE ARE THE WORKERS. AND WHEN THEY ARE DYING. AND NOT ONLY DOES PUBLIC HELP DICTATE WE DO BETTER. BUT WE OWE IT. TO THESE WORKERS TO DO BETTER AND WE ABSOLUTELY SHOULD DO MORE FIGURE OUT WHAT WE CAN DO MORE AS A STATE. TO PROVIDE THE TOOLS TO THE BUSINESSES. TO PROTECT THE WORKERS AND THAT'S WHAT WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO DO WE'VE BEEN PUTTING BILLS FOR. EVEN A BILL MINOR WONDERFUL ON THE FLOOR TODAY. GOT SLICED. DOWN TO A FRACTION OF WHAT IT WAS. ORIGINALLY WAS WHAT IT WAS WAS THERE ARE DESIGNED TO PROTECT WORKERS. SO I THINK I APPRECIATED SOME AREAS WILL BRING THIS. BILL FORWARD. THIS IS A GOOD PUBLIC HEALTH BILL AS MUCH AS IT IS ANYTHING ELSE. AND ALLOWS US AND ALLOWS THE WORKERS THERE RIGHT. TO NOW. THEY ACTUALLY HAVE THE RAIN SO WITH THAT- I DO HAVE A- HE- THEN I RECOMMENDATION AND- WE HAVE A MOTION. FROM ASSEMBLYMEMBER CARILLO SECOND BY SUMMER GONZALEZ- SOME NUMBER BRANDS WHICH I TO CLOSE. THANK YOU I THINK. AT THIS BILL IS ASKING THAT EVERY EMPLOYEE HAVE THE RIGHT TO KNOW THAT THEY HAVE BEEN EXPOSED. THERE'S NOTHING ON THE BOOKS RIGHT NOW THAT REQUIRES THAT NOTHING SO THAT THAT NO EMPLOYER TELLS THE EMPLOYEES THAT THEY'VE BEEN EXPOSED THEY'RE NOT BREAKING THE LAW. BECAUSE THEY'VE NOT BEEN TOLD THAT THEY HAVE TO NOTIFY THEM. THE SECOND THING IS THAT IF THERE IS AN OUTBREAK AND THAT IS THREE OR MORE THAN THEY HAVE TO REPORT IT TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH. WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT SAYING THAT WITH THE ONE ONE- POSITIVE CODED THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO START REPORTING IF THERE IS AN OUTBREAK THREE OR MORE IT NOW BECOMES OF THEY HAVE TO REPORT. I DO WANT TO NOTE THAT WE'VE MET TO NEGOTIATE IN GOOD FAITH. WITH ALL OF THE STAKEHOLDERS TO ADDRESS THEIR OPPOSITION. THE BILL HAS BEEN SUBSTANTIALLY AMENDED TO SIMPLIFY NOTICE REQUIREMENTS. DEFINE WHAT TRIGGERS A NOTICE WE REMOVE DUPLICATIVE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS WE DEFINED AT THE WORK SITE WERE REMOVED REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION WILL REMOVE THE PENALTY WE EXEMPTED MOST HEALTH CARE EMPLOYERS. AND WE ADDED A TWO YEAR SUNSET. I'M STILL COMMITTED TO WORK WITH pSTAKEHOLDERS. BUT OUR WORKERS CANNOT WAIT WE NEED TO PROTECT THEM THEY HAVE AN ABSOLUTE RIGHT TO KNOW WHEN THEY HAVE BEEN EXPOSED SO THAT THEY CAN PROTECT THEMSELVES AND THEIR LOVED ONES. AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. WE WILL GO ON WITH. MOST MOTION IS CONCUR WITH SENATE AMENDMENTS KALRA KALRA HI FLORA FLORA NO CARILLO CARILLO I DEEP. GONZALEZ GONZALEZ I JONES SAWYER JONES SAWYER HI RIVAS RIVAS I. SO WELL. DOES NOT HURT THE SENTIMENTS. THANK YOU ALL. WAIT TO GET YEAH. ALL OF ALARM. FOR THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE. SENATE LEADER THE SENTINEL THE HAPLESS AND REPORT YOU KNOW HI FI. SEVEN FIVE TWO NINE AND GIVEN THE VERY. THANK YOU MISS CHAIR MEMBERS TODAY I AM S. B. C. TWENTY NINE ON BEHALF OF SAN PORTANTINO PORTANTINO WHICH WILL PROGRAM AN EMPLOYEE FROM CIVIL PENALTIES FROM AN EMPLOYER UNDER THE LABOR CODE-PRIVATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL ACT OF TWO THOUSAND FOUR FOR VIOLATIONS OF PROVISIONS REQUIRING THE EMPLOYER TO PROVIDE MEAL AND REST BREAKS IF THE EMPLOYEE ENGAGED IN REMOTE WORK AS SPECIFIED. IN THE MIDST OF THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC MANY EMPLOYERS HAVE INSTITUTED WORK FROM HOME OPTIONS FOR THEIR EMPLOYEES FOR THEIR EMPLOYEES AN EFFORT TO RETAIN THE WORK FORCE AND MAINTAIN WORKERS LIVELIHOODS WHILE MANY BUSINESSES AND NISHIDA TELEWORKING FLEXIBILITY TO COMPLY WITH STATE AND LOCAL STATE HOME ORDERS TELEWORKING REMAINS CRITICAL FOR BOTH EMPLOYERS AND WORKERS AS THE STATE RE OPENS PROVIDING WORKERS WITH THE ABILITY TO WORK REMOTELY FROM HOME IS ONE OF THE ONLY VIABLE OPTIONS FOR MANY BUSINESSES TO CONTINUE THEIR OPERATIONS AND FOR WORKERS TO STAY IN THEIR JOBS. HOWEVER EMPLOYERS HAVE EXPRESSED GROWING CONCERNS THAT THEY ARE UNABLE TO MONITOR WHETHER THEY'RE TELEWORKING EMPLOYEES ARE TAKING MEAL A MEAL AND REST BREAKS AS REQUIRED UNDER THE LABOR CODE BUSINESS GROUPS HAVE NOTED THAT THEY ARE INCREASINGLY WORRIED THAT TEMPORARY WELL INTENTIONED SOLUTIONS SUCH AS TELEWORKING TO KEEP PEOPLE WORKING WILL NOT BE SUSTAINABLE IN THE WEEKS AND MONTHS AHEAD DUE TO THE RISK OF POTENTIAL PAGA SUITS FOR ALLEGED FAILURES TO PROVIDE MEAL AND REST BREAKS TO THEIR TELEWORKING EMPLOYEES. TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE THIS BILL TEMPORARILY SUSPENDS CERTAIN PAGA SUITS IF THE FOLLOWING THREE CONDITIONS ARE MET NUMBER ONE THE EMPLOYEE BEGAN TO WORK FROM THE EMPLOYEES HOME. NINETEEN PANDEMIC AFTER MARCH NINETEENTH TWENTY TWENTY AT THE EMPLOYERS DIRECTION UNDER AN EMPLOYER POLICY PERMITTING SUCH REMOTE WORK OR PURSUANT TO AN AGREEMENT WITH THE EMPLOYER. NUMBER TWO THE ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OCCURRED IN THE PERIOD BETWEEN BEGINNING WITH MARCH NINETEENTH TWENTY TWENTY AND NDING DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TWO. AND ARE FOR MEAL AND REST BREAKS THE EMPLOYER FAILED TO PROVIDE TO AN EMPLOYEE WHILE THAT EMPLOYEE WAS WORKING FOR THE EMPLOYER FROM HOME OR OTHER PLACE OF RESIDENCE. AND THE NUMBER THREE THE AGGRIEVED EMPLOYEE DOES NOT RESIDE ON PROPERTY OWNED BY THE EMPLOYER OR PROVIDED BY THE EMPLOYER TO THE EMPLOYEE. WE SHOULD BE DOING OUR BEST TO ENCOURAGE ALL BUSINESSES THAT CAN WORK REMOTELY TO DO SO FOR THE DURATION OF THE PANDEMIC. PROVIDING WORKERS WITH THE ABILITY TO WORK REMOTELY FROM HOME IS ONE OF THE ONLY VIA A VIABLE OPTIONS FOR MANY BUSINESSES TO CONTINUE THEIR OPERATIONS AND FOR WORKERS TO STAY IN THEIR JOBS. I DO HAVE TWO WITNESSES ON THE PHONE WHO CAN HELP ANSWER QUESTIONS AND- MR CHAU ALLOWED THEM TO. SELF INTRODUCE VISUAL SURE AS YOU COLUMN SURE YES- THANK YOU- THE SUMMER GRAYSON AND- JUST OF ALL OUR BILLS THIS EVENING- YOU SETTLE HAVE UP TO FOUR MINUTES AND SO WITH THE- TWO WITNESSES I BELIEVE YOU HAVE BEEN ADEQUATE COVERAGE OF THE COMMERCE OF THE FOR JUST THE FAMILY BUSINESS ASSOCIATION.

GOOD EVENING MISTER CHAIR MEMBER YOU VERY THAT THAT HAVING BACK TO THE- CHAMBER FROM IN SUPPORT OF THAT BEING SEVEN TWO NINE. OF ALL WE JUST WANT EXPRESS OUR BRIDGE TO THE GOVERNOR FOR HIS LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE AND FOR INCLUDING THIS ITEM AND ITS ECONOMIC PACKAGE FOR THE COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC. ENTERPRISE ARE APPRECIATION THE SENATOR PORTANTINO FOR CARRYING THIS MEASURE AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAYSON FOR- PRESENTING IT TONIGHT. WE UNDERSTAND THAT POGBA IS SOMEWHAT OF A THIRD RAIL. ISSUE WITH VERY STRONG FEELINGS ON BOTH SIDES. BUT IN OUR OPINION THIS BILL PROVIDES VERY MODEST AND COMMONSENSE RELIEF THAT WILL ASSIST EMPLOYERS. IN OFFERING CAL WORK AS AN OPTION DURING THIS CRISIS. UNDER THIS BILL EMPLOYERS WILL STILL HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE MEAL AND REST PERIODS YOU'LL PLEASE WORKING FROM HOME UNDER THE SAME STANDARDS THAT EXIST UNDER EXISTING LAW. TELL YOU. TELL YOU TO PROVIDE ME YOUR RECORDS WILL STILL ENTITLE EMPLOYEES TO RECOVER THE OUR PREMIUM PAY. UNDER LABOR CODE SECTION TWO TO SIX POINT SEVEN FOR EACH MISSED BREAK. ALL THIS BILL WILL PROVIDE IS THAT THERE IS NO RECOVERY OF ADDITIONAL PAGA PENALTIES ON TOP OF THAT FOR SUCH VIOLATIONS. WORKING FROM HOME. FOR A LIMITED PERIOD OF TIME DURING THIS CRISIS UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY TWO. WE THINK THIS IS A NEEDED STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND WILL PROVIDE SOME MODEST LITIGATION RELIEF TO EMPLOYERS TRYING TO DO THE RIGHT THING DURING THIS CRISIS. BY ALLOWING EMPLOYEES TO WORK FROM HOME. ESPECIALLY WITH TE ONGOING NATURE OF THE PANDEMIC AND THE CONTINUED CLOSURE OF SCHOOLS. WE NEED TO BE ENCOURAGING EMPLOYERS OFFER TELL WORKING AS AN OPTION WHERE POSSIBLE. IT IS AN IMPORTANT MEASURE TO AVOID THE SPREAD OF THE VIRUS AND MANY EMPLOYEES PREFER AND NEED THIS OPTION AT THE TIME. REDUCING THE PRODUCT POCKET LITIGATION READ. IN THIS NARROW SITUATION. WILL REMOVE AN OBSTACLE TO EMPLOYERS OFFERING THE TELEWORK AS AN OPTION. WE WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK YOU TO VIEW THIS PROPOSAL IN LIGHT OF THE MANY NEW OBLIGATIONS BEING PLACED ON BUSINESSES DURING THE PANDEMIC IN ADDITION TO THE UNDERLYING ECONOMIC IMPACT OF THE CRISIS ITSELF. IT WOULD BE APPRECIATED LEGISLATURE COULD PROVIDE AT LEAST SOME MODEST RELIEF TO EMPLOYERS IN THIS REGARD AND AGAIN WE THINK IT WILL ENABLE THEM TO OFFER TELEWORKING AS AN OPTION TO THE BENEFIT OF BOTH EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES AT WORK WORKERS. FOR THESE REASONS WE SUPPORT SB SEVEN TWENTY NINE AND WE ASK FOR YOUR I. THE IMMATURE CARE I'D ALSO LIKE TO EXPRESS SUPPORT I'M HAPPY THAT SEPARATE CLIENTS THE NATIONAL PAYROLL REPORTING CONSORTIUM.

AND THAT MORE AND THEIR EMPLOYEE TRAINING AND BENEFITS. THEY'RE MORE LIKELY TO PROMOTE WENT INTO EXECUTIVE MANAGEMENT THEY HAVE BETTER RECORDS ON ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP. AND ARE LESS LIKELY TO LAY OFF WORKERS IN TOUGH ECONOMIC TIMES LIKE THE PRESENT. FAMILY BUSINESSES TAKE TO HEART THE RESPONSIBILITY THAT THEY HAVE TO THEIR EMPLOYEES. ONE EIGHT. SEVEN FOUR EIGHT. DESPITE THE UNPRECEDENTED CHALLENGES BECAUSE THEY NINETEEN CALIFORNIANS PLAYERS ARE MAKING EVERY EFFORT TO HONOR THOSE RESPONSIBILITIES. AT GREAT RISK AND EXPENSE MANY CALIFORNIANS PLAYERS THAT THAT THEIR BUSINESS MODEL UNASSIGNED TO PROVIDE ARRANGEMENTS FOR EMPLOYEES TO WORK FROM HOME. SB EMPLOYERS ACTED IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF OUR EMPLOYEES SAFETY.

GOOD EVENING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS A COMMITTEE THIS IS CHRIS WALKER ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF SHEET METAL AND AIR CONDITIONING CONTRACTORS IN SUPPORT OF THE MEASURE. THANK YOU. IT LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE ONE QUEUING UP OKAY. MOMENT PLEASE. I WITH AN OPERATOR ONE MOMENT. THEY'RE SO WITH THE OPERATE OKAY I GUESS THAT PERSON WAS IN OPPOSITION SO THERE ARE NO OTHER PARTICIPANTS THAT QUEUING UP IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL OKAY OPPOSITION AND TO TEST THE OPPOSITE BY. A COLLECT. YOU HAVE UP TO FOUR MINUTES- WE HAVE SEVERAL FLOCKS WITH THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION FALL BY THE RECALL YOSHIHARA WITH CALIFORNIAN PLANET LAWYERS ASSOCIATION MISS FOX. MEDICARE MEMBERS TERAFLOPS CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION IN OPPOSITION TO SB SEVEN TWENTY NINE. AND WERE IN OPPOSITION BECAUSE THIS BILL TAKES AWAY THE ONLY ENFORCEMENT TOOL AVAILABLE TO MOST CALIFORNIA WORKERS AND THEREFORE SIGNIFICANTLY WEEKEND THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO MEAL AND REST BREAKS FOR EMPLOYEES DOING TELEWORK. AND WHEN WE THINK OF TELEWORK WE OFTEN THINK OF A WHITE COLLAR PROFESSIONAL ON A LAPTOP. THAT HAS THE ABILITY TO CONTROL THEIR OWN SCHEDULE AND TAKE A BREAK WHEN THEY WANT. HOWEVER THIS BILL DOES NOT JUST APPLY TO WELL COMPENSATED PROFESSIONALS WORKING AT HOME THIS BILL APPLIES TO ALL WORKERS WORKING REMOTELY WHATEVER THEIR JOB. AND WHATEVER CONTROL THEIR EMPLOYER HAS OVER THAT. MANY LOW WAGE INDUSTRIES HAVE SHIFTED TO TELEWORK AND HOME BASED WORK INCLUDING CALL CENTERS PACKAGING AND DISTRIBUTION TRANSCRIPTION TRANSLATION TUTORING PRIVATE SCHOOL TEACHING DATA ENTRY SOCIAL MEDIA MODERATORS AND MANY OTHERS. ONE OF THE ORIGINAL WORK FROM HOME INDUSTRIES WITH THE GARMENT INDUSTRY. USES IN THE GARMENT INDUSTRY IS WHY HOME BASED GARMENT WORK IS NOW PROHIBITED. JUST BECAUSE THE JOB IS DONE AT HOME DOES NOT MEAN THAT BASICALLY FOR PROTECTIONS ARE NECESSARY. IN GARMENT EMPLOYERS EXERTED CONTROL OVER WORKERS SUPPORT QUOTAS AND PIECE RATE TODAY TECHNOLOGY HAS MADE IT EVEN EASIER FOR EMPLOYERS TO MONITOR SURVEIL AND CONTROL EVERY MINUTE OF WORKERS TIME. THIS pSHOULD HAVE STRENGTHENED LABOR LAWS NOT THE ELIMINATION OF THE- THIS BILL WOULD TAKE AWAY THE ONLY ENFORCEMENT TOOL AVAILABLE TO MOST WORKERS MORE THAN 60% OF CALIFORNIA WORKERS ARE FORCED TO SIGN ARBITRATION AGREEMENTS UPON HIGHER. CIVIL PENALTIES SO PAGA PENALTIES ARE THE ONLY FORM OF ENFORCEMENT THAT COURTS HAVE FOUND CANNOT BE RESTRICTED BY ARBITRATION. BY TAKING AWAY PAGA PENALTIES THIS BILL ELIMINATES ANY ENFORCEMENT OR DUE PROCESS FOR MANY WORKERS SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY WORK AT HOME. THERE'S ALSO KNOWS AND OF THE NEED TO ELIMINATE PROTECTION. WE ALWAYS HAD PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN WORKING AT HOME AND TELEWORKING WE'VE NOT SEEN A CRISIS OF PAGA CLAIMS THE PANDEMIC HAS NOT. SHOWN THAT DAY BEARD THE COURTS ARE CLOGGED WITH POCKET CLAIMS. TO THE EVIDENCE FOR THIS HUGE SHIFT IS JUST NOT THERE AND LASTLY ELIMINATING THE RIGHTS THAT WORKERS FOUGHT AND DIED FOR DECADES AGO SHOULD NOT BE RUSHED THROUGH AT THE END OF SESSION WITHOUT ADEQUATE VETTING FOR CONSIDERATION OF THE CONSEQUENCES. FOR MILLIONS OF WORKERS WHO ARE WORKING AT HOME. AND FOR THESE REASONS WE URGE A NO VOTE ON SB SEVEN TWENTY NINE. THANK YOU. OF THE SURCHARGE COULD YOU ABOUT A MINUTE AND FIFTEEN SECONDS. THE FOUR MINUTE MINUTE. OKAY I WILL GO FAST THANK YOUR CHAIRMAN BIRDS. ARE WHAT HE CALIFORNIA EMPLOYMENT LAWYERS ASSOCIATION IT DOESN'T TAKE THE TIME TO RESPOND TO SOME OF THE COMMENTS MADE AND THE PORT OF THE BILL. IT WAS STATED THAT THE THREE MANY OF THEM THE REASON FOR THE BILL THE NEED FOR THE BILL IS THAT EMPLOYERS HAVE EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT. THEY CAN'T MONITOR THEIR WORKERS WHO ARE REMOTE AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE TAKING MAIL AROUND. IT THEN I DON'T WANT TO ACTUALLY QUOTE FROM THE DRINKER- CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT DECISION WHICH ACTUALLY SAYS THAT THE EMPLOYER IS NOT OBLIGATED TO POLICE NO BREAK AND ENSURE NO WORK THERE AFTER IT'S PERFORMED. BONA FIDE RELEASED FROM DUTY AND THE RELINQUISHING OF CONTROL SATISFIED THE EMPLOYERS ALTHOUGH. AND WORK BY A RELIEVED IN PLAY DURING THE MEAL BREAK NOT THEREBY PLAYED THE EMPLOYER IN VIOLATION OF THE OBLIGATION AND CREATE LIABILITY- BE PROPONENTS ALSO SET SAID THAT THE LAW DOES NOT CHANGED- THE DUTY TO PROVIDE A MEAL OR REST BREAKS AND THAT THERE WOULD STILL BE A LIABILITY UNDER THE LABOR CODE BUT- AS- I WILL JUST MENTION. ON BECAUSE MOST OF THESE WORKERS HAVE SIGN FORCED ARBITRATION AGREEMENTS IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER BECAUSE A WORKER WOULD BE ABLE TO FILE A CLAIM ANYWAY AND THEIR ONLY OPTION TO ENFORCE THE RIGHT FOR MILLER REST BREAK WOULD BE THROUGH. THAT AND I THINK THAT THE BILL DOES THE FILM THAT EMPLOYEES TO WORK REMOTELY HAVE THE FREEDOM AND FLEXIBILITY TO TAKE A BREAK WHEN THEY WANT. OF COURSE ANY MILLERITES BREAK CLAIM WOULD HAVE. TO BE FRIVOLOUS OR MARYLAND MARYLAND. BUT EVEN THE VERY DANGER THAT SOME BECAUSE THERE'S A- BEEN A- SHARP RIGHT IN THE- OF BEEN. AND THE TYPE CONTROL GRID EMPLOY EARTH. OVER THE WORKERS AT THE TO DO TO THE NEW BOOK REMOTE WORKING CAN. THERE'S EVEN GREATER. EMPOWER COULD. ON WORKERS. BECAUSE ARE AMONG. AND I'LL JUST MENTION THAT THERE WAS A RETHINK IF YOU IF YOU COULD IF YOU COULD ARRIVE UP THE MASSAGER. SHARE 26% OF HR LEADERS HAVE USED USED SOME FORM OF STOP OR TO TRACK REMOTE WORKER SO THERE IS DEFINITELY A LOT OF CONTROL OVER WORKERS EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE IN THEIR HOMES AND SO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WORKERS STILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO TAKE A MEAL OR REST BREAKS IN THE UP STRONGLY URGE YOUR NOTEBOOK THANK YOU. THANK THANK YOU. WE WILL NOW TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ANYONE IN THE ROOM IF NOT ABOUT THIS PUBLIC COMMENT AGAIN FOR THOSE IN OPPOSITION JUST JUST STATE YOUR NAME AFFILIATION AND POSITION ON THE BILL PLEASE- MONNESS MODERATOR DO WE HAVE ANYONE ON THE PHONE.
