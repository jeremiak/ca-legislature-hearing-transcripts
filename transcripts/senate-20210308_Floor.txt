WHERE WOMEN PROTESTED THEIR TERRIBLE WORKING CONDITIONS THIS YEAR THE UNITED NATIONS AND THE HOUSE THAT THE THEME WOULD BE WOMEN IN LEADERSHIP ACHIEVING AN EQUAL FUTURE THE COBRA NINETEEN WORLD. THE THEME CELEBRATE THE TREMENDOUS EFFORTS BY WOMEN AND GIRLS AROUND THE WORLD IN SHAPING A MORE EQUITABLE FUTURE AND REQUIRE COVERAGE FROM THE COVERED NINETEEN PANDEMIC. WE ALL KNOW THAT CODE NINETEEN HAS A HUGE IMPACT A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON WOMEN ACROSS THIS STATE AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY. FROM JOB LOSSES TO CHILD CARE CHALLENGES. WOMEN CONTRIBUTE SO MUCH TO OUR ECONOMY YET IN THE LAST TEN MONTHS THE ACCOUNT FOR FIVE POINT FOUR MILLION JOB LOSSES. NEARLY ONE MILLION MORE JOB LOSSES THAN MEN. IN FACT THE NATION'S EMPLOYMENT NUMBERS FOR DECEMBER REVEALED THAT WITH THE EXCEPTION OF FARMERS. ALL JOB LOSSES WERE ENTIRELY BORNE BY WOMEN PARTICULARLY WOMEN OF COLOR. THIS STARK REALITY IS UNACCEPTABLE SO WE MUST ENSURE THAT WE DO MORE TO HELP UP LIFT ALL WOMEN. AND NOT JUST TALK THE TALK BUT WALK THE WALK BECAUSE AS WE ALL KNOW WHEN WOMEN SUCCEED. EVERYONE SUCCEEDS WHEN WOMEN ARE AT THE TABLE EVERYONE IS AT THE TABLE. INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY IS A TIME TO REFLECT ON PROGRESS MADE TO CALL FOR CHANGE TO CELEBRATE ACTS OF COURAGE AND DETERMINATION.

THIS IS OUR- COLLEAGUE WHO INTRODUCED THE RESOLUTION POINTED OUT. WOMEN HAVE BEEN SEVERELY HIT BY THIS PAN SESSION. AND ECONOMIC EQUITY IS THE FORMER FRENCH CHALLENGE FOR US FOR WOMEN RIGHT NOW AND SOMETHING THAT WE AS CALIFORNIA POLICY MAKERS HAVE TO TAKE VERY SERIOUSLY BECAUSE THE IMPACT FROM THIS SESSION WILL NOT ONLY BE FELT THIS YEAR BUT FOR YEARS TO COME ANY ESTIMATIONS ARE VERY COULD BE. MINIMUM OF TWENTY YEARS BEFORE WOMEN WHO EITHER LOST THEIR JOBS OR LEFT THEIR JOBS DURING THIS TRANSITION COME BACK ECONOMICALLY AND WHY BECAUSE DURING THAT TIME THEY'RE NOT CONTRIBUTING TO SOCIAL SECURITY THEY CANNOT CONTRIBUTE TO ANY FOUR OH ONE K. THEIR OWN CHILDREN OUR- IMPACTED. FINANCIALLY THEY THEMSELVES NOT ONLY DO TO REDUCE THAT LESS RETIREMENT SECURITY BUT WITHIN THEIR OWN JOBS THEY'RE NOT ACCUMULATING EITHER THE HOURS FOR THE RECOGNITION TO BE ABLE TO MOVE UP THEN IN THAT JOB SO ALL OF THESE THINGS WILL IMPACT WOMEN FINANCIALLY WHICH THEN IMPACTS WHOLE FAMILY SCHOOL HOUSEHOLDS IN THE ENTIRE STATE'S ECONOMY. SO I WANTED TO BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT OUR OBLIGATION TO LOOK AT THIS ISSUE SERIOUSLY AND TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE CAN MAKE ECONOMIC EQUITY FOR WOMEN MORE AT THE FOUR FRIENDS BECAUSE IT IS THEN EQUITY FOR OUR FAMILIES AND FOR THE WHOLE ECONOMY OF THE STATE AND- WITHOUT I.

FIVE THIRTY FIVE NO ZERO MEASURE PASSES. GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS WE ARE GOING TO FILE ITEM TEN SENATOR CABALLERO. MA'AM SECRETARY PLEASE READ SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION SIXTEEN BY SENATOR CABALLERO RELATIVE TO WOMEN IN CONSTRUCTION WEEK SENATE CABALLERO THANK YOU MR A MADAM PRESIDENT I RISE TO PRESENT SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION SIXTEEN WHICH DECLARES MARCH SEVENTH THROUGH THE THIRTEENTH AS WOMEN IN CONSTRUCTION WEEK. MEMBER OF THE LEGISLATIVE WOMEN'S CAUCUS AND THEN MADE WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH I'M PROUD TO DECLARE THE LEGISLATURE SUPPORT FOR PROGRAMS AND POLICIES THAT PROMOTE AN EQUITABLE WORKPLACE FOR WOMEN. S. C. R. SIXTEEN CELEBRATES WOMEN WORKERS AS AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT OF THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY AND ENCOURAGES POLICYMAKERS TO ENACT LEGISLATION THAT WILL INCREASE THEIR PRESENCE IN THE WORK FORCE. IN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY WOMEN BATTLE WIDELY RECOGNIZED GENDER RELATED CHALLENGES SUCH AS GENDER BIASES SEXUAL HARASSMENT LACK OF ADEQUATE RESOURCES AND BENEFITS AND SOCIAL PREJUDICES. OF ALL TEN MILLION PEOPLE EMPLOYED IN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY ONLY 9% OF THE WORKERS ARE WOMEN THE HIGHEST HIGHEST REPORTED PERCENT TO DATE. WE CAN AND MUST DO BETTER THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY PROVIDES OPPORTUNITIES FOR WOMEN TO ACHIEVE FINANCIAL SECURITY DESPITE FACING UNDER REPRESENTATION WOMEN IN THE CONSTRUCTION SECTOR EARN ON AVERAGE ABOUT 95% OF WHAT THEIR MALE COUNTERPARTS MAKE THEM NEARLY ELIMINATING THE GENDER WAGE GAP. BY COMPARISON AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL WOMEN IN THE U. S. EARN ONLY 81% OF WHAT THEIR MALE COUNTERPARTS MAKE. S. YEAR SIXTEEN RECOGNIZES THAT CALIFORNIA CAN MEET ITS INFRASTRUCTURE GOALS BY ACKNOWLEDGING WOMEN AS AN UNTAPPED RESOURCE TO HELP CLOSE THE SKILLED LABOR GAP. WE KNOW THERE IS AN ENORMOUS NEED FOR NEIGHBORS IN CALIFORNIA AND THE CONSTRUCTION WORKFORCE IS SHRINKING FOR EVERY FIVE CONSTRUCTION WORKERS LEAVING THE WORK FORCE THERE IS ONLY ONE IN THE IN THE PIPELINE TO REPLACE THEM. WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY EDUCATE AND INSPIRE WOMEN TO PURSUE REWARDING CAREER OPPORTUNITIES IN CONSTRUCTION AND THE TRADES. THROUGHOUT THE CUPBOARD NINETEEN PANDEMIC CONSTRUCTION HAS REMAINED AN ESSENTIAL INDUSTRY HIGHLIGHTING ITS IMPORTANT ROLE WITHIN OUR SOCIETY. THE SHORTAGE OF WOMEN IN CONSTRUCTION PRESENTS THE INDUSTRY THE OPPORTUNITY FOR WOMEN TO CONTRIBUTE A BROADER OTHERWISE AND CONSIDERED PERSPECTIVE. IMPROVE TEAM PERFORMANCE AND SEEK PROFESSIONAL GROWTH IN WAYS THAT WERE TRADITIONALLY UNAVAILABLE. CONVINCING WOMEN THAT CAN THRIVE AND CAN EXPECT RESPECT AND SUPPORT AS A WORKER IN THE CONSTRUCTION AND THE TRADE INDUSTRY IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT AND WON'T HAPPEN OVERNIGHT. IT'S A LONG GAME BUT I KNOW THAT THE LEADERSHIP IN THE TRADES ARE COMMITTED TO THIS CHANGE AND WITH PERSISTENCE WE CAN ENSURE THAT MORE WOMEN BECOME TRAINED. AND HIRED IN THIS IMPORTANT INDUSTRY FOR THOSE REASONS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS. THANK YOU SIR CABALLERO MEMBERS ANY DISCUSSION AND OR DEBATE.
