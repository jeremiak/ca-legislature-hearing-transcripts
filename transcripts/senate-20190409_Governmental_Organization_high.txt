I CENTER NIELSEN WHO WILL BE PRESENTING WITH US IS CURRENTLY PRESENTING THREE BILLS AND PUBLIC SAFETY NET IF YOU'VE HEARD BUT THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF A MEETING GOING ON OVER THERE -- SO HE WILL BE HERE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE -- OR THE HEAVY LIFTING ON A THEIR YEAH -- OR HE'LL BE HERE TOMORROW NIGHT SO -- AND AS A MEMBER GALLAGHER WHO'S GONNA ALSO PLAN IN PRESENTING TODAY WITH US. IS IN COMMITTEES I DO APOLOGIZE AND ALSO WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO CHAIRMAN DOT. FOR HIS PARTNERSHIP -- NOT JUST ON THIS BILL BUT THROUGHOUT THE NORTH BAY FIRES HI CHAIRMAN DODD HAS BEEN A TENACIOUS ADVOCATE HE'S BEEN FIGHTING FOR THE FOLKS WHO HAVE BEEN IMPACTED FOR THE SURVIVORS. IN JUST ONE TAKE MOMENT SAY THANK YOU FOR ALL OF YOUR WORK AND ALL SHE'S A FIRE PREVENTION RESPONSE HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA LIKE WHY SEVEN THANK YOU. MEMBERS IN MISTER CHAIR THE NIGHT OF OCTOBER A CHANGE THE LIVES OF TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS FOR EVER. WHETHER YOU'RE ONE OF THE TEN WANT ONE OF YOU WHETHER YOU WERE ONE OF THE ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND EVACUATED. ONE OF THE SIX THOUSAND WHO LOST THEIR HOME. ONE OF THE THOUSANDS WHO FLED IN THE MIDDLE IN NINETY THROUGH THE FLAMES OR ONE OF THE DOZENS. IT DOESN'T TO OFF LOAD LOS LED ONES DUE TO A FIRE. YOUR LIFE SHOULD NOT GO IN VAIN. IMAGINE BEING IN A LIFE THREATENING EMERGENCY PICKING UP YOUR PHONE TO CALL 911- IN HAVING NO SERVICE OR DIAL TONE. OR BEING DEAD IS SLEEPING NEVER RECEIVING EMERGENCY ALERT TO LET YOU KNOW FLAMES CLOSE IN IN IN ABOUT TWO ANGLE FOR HOME. UNFORTUNATELY THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS ARE FACED WITH THE REALITY SEVERAL TIMES A YEAR NOW. IN THESE REAL WORLD SCENARIOS ARE INCREASING TO THE SIZE AND SCOPE OF CALIFORNIA'S WHILE IN FIRES. IN AN EMERGENCY OR CATASTROPHIC SITUATION LACK OF ACCESS TO EMERGENCY SERVICES ARE PUBLIC ALERTS AND WARNINGS BUT LIVES AT RISK. SB SIX SEVENTY IS A SIMPLE STEP TO MITIGATE THE RISKS DURING TIMES OF TOTAL CRISIS INFONET DIGITS. BY REQUIRING THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROVIDERS TO PROVIDE REPORTS OF NINE ONE ONE SERVICE OUTAGES OR OUTAGES AFFECTING ALERT IN MORNING TELETECH KNOWLEDGE SHE'S TO THE CALIFORNIA OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES. IN REAL TIME. THIS SEEMS LIKE IT SHOULD ALREADY BE HAPPENING NOW BUT IT'S NOT. IT'S COMMONSENSE APPROACH WILL ENSURE COORDINATION BETWEEN STATE AND LOCAL EMERGENCY OFFICIALS AND TELECOMMUNICATION COMPANIES. SB SIX SEVEN PROVIDE EMERGENCY OFFICIALS WITH REAL TIME DATA REAL TIME DATA. IN THE CRUCIAL INFORMATION THEY NEED TO BE TO KEEP OUR COMMUNITY SAFE. THE FEDERAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION ONLY REQUIRES REPORTING OUTAGES THAT LAST THIRTY MINUTES. AND HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO AFFECT NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND USER MINUTES. BREAKING THIS DOWN UNDER THIS THRESHOLD IT WOULD TAKE TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE. HAVE ANY NOW DID YOU THE LAST NINETY SIXTEEN MINUTES BEFORE THE THRESHOLD FOR REPORTING TO THE FCC IS ACTUALLY HIT. AND THEN PROVIDERS ARE GIVEN ANOTHER HUNDRED AND TWENTY MINUTES TO NOTIFY THE FCC. BUT HERE'S THE PROBLEM. WELL THAT IS A DELAYED RESPONSE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WHO IS NOT RESPONDING DIRECTLY HERE IN THIS STATE. THEY THEN SEND THOSE NOTICES THAT THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. BECAUSE THEY SHARE ALL COMPONENTS OF NINE ONE ONE SERVICE. AND IF YOU SEE IS NOT DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN THE FIGHT WHEN IT COMES TO NATURAL DISASTERS. SO THE NOTIFICATION OF A NINE ONE ONE OUT EACH. FOR NOW IS AN FX EMERGENCY ALERTS HAPPEN SOMETIMES DAYS AFTER THE ACTUAL PARTIES OCCURS NOT REAL TIME WHEN TO GIVE YOU TWO EXAMPLES. DURING THE CAMPFIRE. WHICH THE SHERIFF WILL BE SPEAKING ABOUT IN JUST A BIT MORE GRATEFUL THAT HE'S HERE. THE CAMPFIRE BEGAN AT APPROXIMATELY SIX THIRTY THREE AM ON NOVEMBER EIGHTH. THE CPUC RECEIVED A NOTIFICATION FROM THE FCC OF THE OUTAGE. FIVE HOURS LATER. AT TWELVE OH ONE PM AFTER THOUSANDS OF HOMES HAVE BEEN DESTROYED. THE TUBS FIRE IN SANTA ROSA. IT BEGAN APPROXIMATELY NINE FORTY THREE PM ON OCTOBER EIGHTH. TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN TO SEE IF YOU SEE RECEIVE THEIR NOTIFICATION FROM THE FCC OVER SIX HOURS LATER AT FOUR TWELVE AM THE NEXT MORNING. AND IN THAT TIME. THOUSANDS OF HOMES HAVE BEEN DESTROYED IN THE FLAMES. BY THAT TIME THE TUBS FIRE HAD BURNED INTO CENTRAL SANTA ROSA. IN CALLAWAY YES NEVER RECEIVED A FORMAL NOTIFICATION. CURRENTLY ONE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES GO DOWN AFFECTING NINE ONE ONE SERVICE OR THE ABILITY FOR EMERGENCY OFFICIALS A CENTER EMERGENCY ALERTS. TELECOMMUNICATION COMPANIES ARE NOT REQUIRED TO REPORT REAL TIME INFORMATION ABOUT THE LOCATION OF THE OUTAGE HOW MANY INDIVIDUALS ARE AFFECTED AND WHEN THE ESTIMATED TIME FOR REPAIR EASE. CALIFORNIANS CANNOT AFFORD TO BE WITHOUT THE MOST UP TO DATE INFORMATION DURING TIMES OF DISASTER. SB SIX SEVENTY WOULD REQUIRE PROVIDERS OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES TO PROVIDE NOTIFICATION THE CALIFORNIA OFFICE EMERGENCY SERVICES WHENEVER THERE IS A NINE ONE ONE SERVICE OUTAGE OR ANY OUTAGE AFFECTING EMERGENCY WARNING CAPABILITIES. WITHIN SIXTY MINUTES OF THAT OUTAGE STARTING. CALLOW YES WITHIN BE RESPONSIBLE FOR NOTIFYING THE AFFECTED LOCAL COUNTY -- YES AND THIS WOULD ENSURE THAT ALL NECESSARY MERCY FISHEL'S ARE GETTING THE INFORMATION THEY NEED TO GO TO KEEP RESIDENTS SAFE. TELECOMMUNICATION PROVIDERS WOULD BE REQUIRED TO NOTIFY CAL WE **** WITHIN SIXTY MINUTES AND THE FOLLOWING TYPES OF INFORMATION WHEN AN OUTAGE OCCURS THE DESCRIPTION OF THE ESTIMATED AREA AFFECTED. THE APPROXIMATE NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS AFFECTED THE ESTIMATED TIME TO RESTORE THE OUTAGE IN A CONTACT PERSON THAT CAO YES CAN REACH OUT FOR FURTHER UPDATES. VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT WE ALREADY DO WHEN IT COMES TO ELECTRIC OUTAGES IN THE STATE. ON INDEED HERE MISTER CHAIR. AND SAY THAT SB SIX SEVENTY WILL ENSURE OUR STATE AND LOCAL EMERGENCY OFFICIALS HAVE RESPOND EARNERS AND FIRST RESPONDERS AT THE CRUCIAL INFORMATION THEY NEED TO RESPOND WHEN THOSE EXTRA MINUTES CAN SAVE LIVES.

EVERY BIT OF OPPORTUNITY. WE CAN GET THEM. TO PROTECT THEMSELVES AS WELL. THANK YOU THANK SENATOR. JOINT CHIEFS. MORNING. MORNING CHAIR MEMBERS MY NAME IS TONY GOES ON THE FIRE CHIEF FOR THE CITY SANTA ROSA. THE RECENT FIRES OF SONOMA NAPA OF INTER COUNTIES HAVE AMONG THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE IN STTE HISTORY. THE DISASTERS HAVE SHOWN THAT THE MERCY TELECOMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS NEED TO BE IMPROVED BOTH FOR THE WRIST RESIDENTS. AND THE FIRST RESPONDERS. WHAT THE TUBS AND THE NUNS IN CINEMA COUNTY THE ATLAS NAPA REDWOOD IN MENDOCINO COUNTY THE THOMAS INVERT WINTER? AND LAST YEAR THE CAR IN THE CAMP FIRE. THESE FIRES ARE BURNING ADD ADD ON CONTROL REYES AND WE'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE. NOT TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE PERSPECTIVE THE TUBS FIRE THAT IMPACTED THE CITY OF SANTA ROSA STARTED IN AND THE COUNTY OF NAPA. WITHIN FOUR HOURS OF BURN. TWELVE MILES AND LANDED IN THE HEART OF THE CITY SANTA ROSA FOUR HOURS. YOU'LL HEAR ABOUT NINETY SIXTY FOR THE SAME FOOTPRINT NAY HANLEY FIRE TOOK FOUR DAYS TO GET THERE -- AND AND THAT'S A LITTLE BIT OF A MISNOMER IT WAS MORE LIKE EIGHTEEN HOURS ONCE A WIN SHIFTED BUT IT TOOK EIGHTEEN HOURS IT TOOK FOUR HOURS -- FOR OUR FIRE. DURING THAT TIME WE LOST THREE THOUSAND HOMES SANTA ROSA WITH THE COUNTY -- AND SANTA ROSA THERE WERE SIX THOUSAND HOMES DESTROYED. AND TWENTY FOUR LIVES WERE TAKEN FROM US. EARLY WARNING IN IS VITAL SO WEAKENED WHEN WE KNOW ABOUT THE SITUATIONS WE CAN GET THE WORD OUT AS QUICK AS WE CAN AND WE CAN HELP PEOPLE EVACUATE. I WILL TELL YOU THAT NIGHT IN SANTA ROSA FROM SIX O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING UNTIL MIDNIGHT -- WE HAD TEN REPORTED STRUCTURE FIRES AND TWENTY REPORTED VEGETATION FIRES JUST IN THE CITY OF SANTA ROSA. SO WE WERE EXTREMELY BUSY -- WALL THE FIRE -- THE THE TUBS FIRE STARTED AT NINE FORTY FIVE IN ANOTHER COUNTY AND DIDN'T EVEN HIT US UNTIL ONE IN THE MORNING. SO THE SITUATIONAL AWARENESS WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO GRASP IN TERMS OF WHAT WAS COMING TOWARDS US BECAUSE WE WERE SO BUSY. IN OUR OWN RIGHT. SB SIX SEVENTY WOULD REQUIRE PROVIDERS TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES TO NOTIFY CAL -- YES WHENEVER THERE'S A NINE ONE ONE SERVICE OUTAGE OR ANY OUTAGE AFFECTING OR MERCY WARNING CAPABILITIES WITHIN SIXTY MINUTES. OF THE OUTAGE. SIXTY MINUTES IS A GREAT STARTING POINT BUT I THINK IT NEEDS TO BE SOONER -- BUT SIXTY MINUTES IS A GREAT STARTING POINT. KALLUS WITHIN LET THE LOCAL MERCY PERSONAL. KNOW ABOUT THESE OUTAGES. WOULD ENSURE THAT ALL NECESSARY MERCY OFFICIALS ARE GETTING THE INFORMATION THEY NEED TO KEEP THE RESIDENTS SAVE TO ALLOW US -- TO LET PEOPLE KNOW THAT THEY ARE IN DANGER. THE FIRST FEW HOURS OF OUR FIRE THE TUBS AND ALSO THE NINES WE LOST MORE THAN SEVENTY CELL TOWERS WITHIN THE FIRST FEW HOURS OF THE FIRE. ONCE YOU LOSE A A CELL TOWER YOU LOSE COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE RESIDENTS YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO PROTECT. WE NEED TO HAVE THE EARLY NOTIFICATION SO WE CAN GET THE PROPER NOTIFICATIONS OUT -- IT'LL ALSO GIVE US BETTER SITUATIONAL RON AWARENESS WHICH WILL HAPPEN AROUND US -- IN IT. WILL. HELP US INFORMED ARE THE PEOPLE THAT THAT WERE TRYING TO PROTECT. SB SIX SEVENTY WILSHIRE THAT OUR STATE LOCAL MERCY OFFICIALS AND RESPOND HERS HAVE THE CRUCIAL INFORMATION THEY NEED TO RESPOND WHEN THOSE EXTRA MINUTES COULD SAVE LIVES. THE BILL. SB SIX SEVENTY IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT MEASURES TO COME BEFORE THE LEGISLATION THIS. AT THE SESSION THE CITY'S GENERAL AND MYSELF SUPPORT THIS BILL WHOLEHEARTEDLY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. GOOD MORNING CENTERED ON MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME -- BUT ALSO LIKE TO THANK US IN REGARDS FOR NELSON FOR INVITING ME -- IS YOU KNOW MY NAME IS COREY HONEY AND I'M THE SHERIFF OF BI&lt;c.cyan&gt; COUNTY.&lt;/c&gt; I'M ALSO THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION REPRESENTATIVE FOR THE STATE NINE ONE ONE ADVISORY BOARD. I'M IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL AS WELL AS CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION. AS YOU KNOW MY COUNTY IS NO STRANGER TO HAVING TO NOTIFY PEOPLE OF HI IMPENDING. DANGEROUS CONDITIONS -- AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE. CENTER NIELSEN SPOKE OF THE ORAL DAM SPILLWAYS INCIDENT -- AND THEN AGAIN -- MOST RECENTLY -- THE CAMPFIRE. IN BETWEEN THAT THOUGH OTHER OTHER FIRES THAT WE HAD TO UTILIZE. OUR MERCY MASSED ON VACATION SYSTEM RELYING HEAVILY POINT WHERE SHE DID SHE TELL YOU CASES SYSTEM. TO ALERT OUR CITIZENS TO THE THREAT THAT WAS COMING THEIR WAY. A CAMPFIRE IS YOU KNOW HAS BEEN DETERMINED AT THIS POINT AND I HOPE IT STAYS THAT WAY THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE FIRE IN HISTORY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IT CONSUMES SOME EIGHTEEN THOUSAND STRUCTURES REGRETTABLY RESULTED IN THE DEATH OF EIGHTY FIVE CITIZENS. RATE. ULTIMATELY CONSUMED HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND ACRES. OVER THE COURSE OF TIME. PUBLIC SAFETY HAS BECOME A VERY RELIANT UPON THE MERCY TELECOMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM. TO COMMUNICATE WITH OUR CITIZENS ABOUT THREATS THAT THEY ARE FACING. AS WELL AS THEM COMMUNICATE WITH US ABOUT THREATS THE TO THE CITY. QUITE FRANKLY IT IS THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE WAY TO COMMUNICATE WITH CITIZENS. AND ALTHOUGH -- IT IS. BECAUSE THE TECHNOLOGY TECHNOLOGICALLY BASED SYSTEM -- AND CERTAINLY. HAS. THE POTENTIAL FOR GOING DOWN -- WE HAVE TO BE ABLE -- TO UNDERSTAND WHEN THAT HAPPENS AND THEN ADJUST OUR RESPONSE ACCORDINGLY. AS YOU KNOW -- SENATE BILL SIX SEVENTY I WOULD REQUIRE -- THE OUTAGE TO BE -- THE THE THE THE THE PROVIDERS FOR TO A NOTIFY CALLOW YES AND THEN THE SHERIFF AND LOCAL MERCY MANAGEMENT. OF THE OUTAGE WITHIN ONE HOUR OF THEM DISCOVERED. I CAN TELL YOU THAT THAT'S AN IMPORTANT THING IT WOULD HELP US UNDERSTAND THE LANDSCAPE THAT WERE OPERATING IN AND IT JUST OUR APPROACH TO NOTIFYING EVACUATING PEOPLE. MUCH MUCH MORE EFFECTIVELY AND MUCH MORE QUICKLY. I KNOW DURING THE COURSE OF OUR PRELIMINARY AN ONGOING EVALUATION OF THE RESPONSE IN OUR EFFORT TO NOTIFY PEOPLE. THE PRELIMINARY INFORMATION WE HAVE AT THIS POINT IS THAT -- WE SENT OUT -- OVER TWENTY NINE THOUSAND ALERTS THROUGH OUR MERCY MASS NOTIFICATION SYSTEM -- MANY OF THEM GOING -- TO PEOPLE WITH CELL PHONES. UNFORTUNATELY IT LOOKS LIKE THERE WAS A FAILURE RATE OF ABOUT FIFTEEN THOUSAND AND THAT BEGAN AROUND NINE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING. BUT AS YOU HEARD A MOMENT AGO -- WE WEREN'T NOTIFIED OF THE OUTAGE UNTIL AROUND. TWELVE I WOULD HOPE THAT HAD WE BEEN ARMED WITH THE KNOWLEDGE EARLIER IN THE DAY -- WE COULD HAVE ADJUSTED OUR APPROACH -- TO COMMUNICATING WITH HE COMMUNITY pTHAT HOPEFULLY WOULD HAVE REACHED PEOPLE I THINK THAT THIS BILL WILL CERTAINLY GO A LONG WAY TOWARDS DOING THAT. ANYTHING THAT WE CAN DO TO STREAMLINE. THE COMMUNICATION OF CRITICAL INFORMATION TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ON THE GROUND. WHO ARE MAKING DECISIONS ABOUT HOW -- TO NOTIFY PEOPLE OF DANGERS AND TO ALERT THEM TO THE RIGHT COURSE OF ACTION I THINK IS IMPORTANT. SB SIX SEVENTY WOULD CERTAINLY DO THAT WHICH IS WHY I'M IN SUPPORT OF IT WHICH I THINK -- IS WHY CALIFORNIA SURE SUFFICIENT SUPPORT OF IT AND I WOULD ASK THE U. S. SUPPORT AS WELL. THANK YOU SHERIFF -- ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT PLEASE US STATE YOUR NAME ADD YOUR ORGANIZATION AND WHAT DO YOU SUPPORT OR NOT. THE MORNING TRACY RHYME ROLE COUNTY REPRESENTS A CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. MORNING CHAIR -- MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE RUBBER TO GO HERE ON BEHALF OF THE U.

FOR EMERGENCY NOTIFICATIONS ARE WE RIGHT NOW ARE IN THE PROCESS OF DOING THOSE NEGOTIATIONS OURSELVES FOR THE CABLE INSIST INSTITUTION -- MEMBERS SO OUR HOPE IS THAT AT SOME POINT WITH MISPRINT WHY WE HAVE BEEN IN DISCUSSIONS REQUIRE IS THAT WE CAN SORT OF FORMALIZED THAT RELATIONSHIP. SO THAT WE CAN PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION VERY TIMELY WE SEE THIS AS A COMPLIMENT TO YOUR LEGISLATION LASHER EIGHT THREE THREE WHICH WAS SIGNIFICANT I THINK THAT WAS FAR MORE DIFFICULT AND GETTING TRAINING TO A LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND WENT TO ISSUE ALERTS. IT DOES A LARGE CAN GET OUT EARLIER OVER OUR NETWORKS BEFORE THEY BURNED OUT. THAT'S THE THAT'S THE MOST TIMELY IMPACT THAT YOU CAN HAVE SO A LOT OF THIS INFORMATION IS VERY VALUABLE FOR BUILDING OUR NETWORKS OUT LATER ON BUT I THINK THERE IS IF YOU LOOK AT THE DIFFERENT COUNTIES THAT HAVE HANDLED THOSE ALERTS DIFFERENTLY -- ONE OF THE COUNTIES LAKE COUNTY ACTUALLY WAS VERY STRATEGIC AND INNER ALERTS UP VERY EARLY AND HAD A FORMER POSITIVE IMPACT. BUT WE DO SEE THIS THIS BILL AS A COMPLEMENT TO THAT BILL AND WE DO WANT TO WORK FOR THE CENTER AND GET THAT ACCOMPLISHED THANK YOU. THANK YOU. NEXT.

GALGIANI. GALGIANI AYE GLAZER [inaudible] HILL. HELLO FIVE WESTERN [inaudible] JONES. NIELSEN. NIELSEN AYE PORTANTINO. PORTANTINO AYE RUBIO. RUBIO AYE WIENER. THE HOLDER OPEN [inaudible] SIX THE BILL HAS -- SIX VOTE TO HOLD THE ROLE OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. OKAY NOW WHAT WE'RE GONNA MOVED ITEM NUMBER TWO SB ONE SIXTY CENTER JACKSON MORNING CENTER. I AM HERE TODAY TO PRESENT SB ONE SIXTY A BILL THAT DIRECTS COUNTIES TO INTEGRATE CULTURAL COMPETENCE. INTO THE NEXT PHASE AN UPDATE OF THEIR COUNTY EMERGENCY PLANS. I KNOW THAT THE PRIOR THE BILL ALSO ADDRESSES WHAT WE DO IN CASES OF EMERGENCY. AND I KNOW THAT THE CHAIR AS WELL AS OTHER MEMBERS HERE. HAVE OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS EXPERIENCE THESE DRAMATIC AND LIFE THREATENING CIRCUMSTANCES IN THEIR OWN DISTRICTS. WE ALL KNOW IT IS THE INHERENT RESPONSIBILITY OF GOVERNMENT AT ALL LEVELS TO PROTECT LIFE AND PROPERTY. DURING EMERGENCIES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CARRY OUT THIS RESPONSIBILITY BY PLANNING FOR NATURAL AND HUMAN CAUSED DISASTERS. AND GIVEN CALIFORNIA'S VAST DIVERSITY IT IS UP TO LOCAL PLANNERS TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE VARIOUS NEEDS OF THEIR COUNTIES THEIR COMMUNITIES -- EQUALLY DIVERSE AS THEY ARE. THE LEGISLATURE'S RECOGNIZE THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS PARTICULAR ASPECT OF LOCAL EMERGENCY PLANNING FIRST. WITH THE AB TWENTY THREE ELEVEN BACK IN TWENTY SIXTEEN BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER BROWN WHICH REQUIRES COUNTIES TO INTEGRATE PLANNING FOR THE ACCESS AND FUNCTIONAL NEEDS. RESIDENTS THAT LIVE IN THEIR JURISDICTIONS NEED AS THEY DO THEIR NEXT UPDATE OF THEIR COUNTY EMERGENCY PLAN. LAST YEAR AB EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEE MONN BASED UPON THE THOMAS FIRE IN OUR ASSURE DISTRICT -- ADDRESS THE LACK OF ADEQUATE LANGUAGE TRANSLATION SERVICES DISPLAYED DURING BOTH THE ATLAS AND THOMAS FIRES OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN AMONG OTHERS. AND THIS BILL REQUIRES CAL -- YES TO DEVELOP A LIBRARY OF EMERGENCY RELATED TERMS AND PHRASES FOR COUNTIES TO HAVE AS REFERENCE WHEN DEVELOPING TRANSLATED VERSIONS OF THEIR EMERGENCY NOTIFICATIONS. AS AN EXAMPLE DURING THE THOMAS FIRE WHICH BURNED FOR FORTY DAYS IN MY DISTRICT. A DISTANCE OF ABOUT FORTY FIVE MILES THE TRANSLATION TO OUR APPROXIMATELY 40% OF SPANISH SPEAKING COMMUNITY WAS DONE THROUGH A GOOGLE APP AND REFERRED TO THE FIRE IS THE HAIR BRUSH FIRE. OBVIOUSLY A LITTLE MISLEADING FOR A FIRE THAT BURNED ALMOST THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES. AND YET FOR SPANISH SPEAKING PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T ACTUALLY LOOK OUT THE WINDOW AND SEE THIS HORRIFIC FIRE BURNING. THEY WERE TOLD IT WAS A HAIR BRUSH FIRE. SO WE REALIZE THAT. WE HAVE GOT TO DO MORE AND WHILE THESE EFFORTS HAVE MADE SIGNIFICANT STRIDES IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION MORE WORK NEEDS TO BE DONE IN ORDER TO FULLY INTEGRATE. THE NEEDS OF ALL CALIFORNIANS INTO OUR COUNTY EMERGENCY PLANNING. THE POINT WAS MADE EVIDENT INDEED DURING A HEARING THAT THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE ON EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT HELD IN NOVEMBER TWENTY EIGHTEEN WHILE I WAS ITS CHAIR. WHICH EXAMINED HOW RECENT LEGISLATION HAS INDEED IMPROVED EMERGENCY ALERTS IN CALIFORNIA THE AHA MOMENT THOUGH FOR THIS BILL CAME WHEN WITNESSES DESCRIBE HOW FOR NON ENGLISH SPEAKING COMMUNITIES. COUNTIES HAVING A STAFF MEMBER PROFICIENT IN THE LANGUAGE OF A PARTICULAR COMMUNITY IS SIMPLY NOT ENOUGH. TO HAVE AN EFFECTIVE STREAM OF COMMUNICATION WITH THEM. IT ALSO REQUIRES THAT THE COUNTY HAVE COMPLEMENTARY COMPREHENSIVE UNDERSTANDING OF THE CULTURAL AND SOCIAL DYNAMICS OF THAT COMMUNITY IT'S CULTURAL COMPETENCE SO THE QUESTION IS IF PEOPLE GIVEN NOTICE. WERE THEY GIVEN NOTICE SO WHAT ARE THEY GIVEN NOTICE ON THERE SOME COMMUNITIES THAT DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO CERTAIN TYPES OF PRINCIPALLY WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS WHO ARE THEY LIKELY TO LISTEN. TO HOW ARE THEY LIKELY TO REACT WHO ARE THE PEOPLE MOST LIKELY TO BE THE MOST EFFECTIVE IN HELPING THESE COMMUNITIES DO WHAT IS NECESSARY TO BE KEPT TO BE SAFE. AND AVOID THE DANGERS OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES SO THIS COMP A CONCEPT OF CULTURAL COMPETENCE. REALLY TRANSCENDS LANGUAGE BARRIERS TO ALSO APPLY TO ENGLISH SPEAKING COMMUNITIES WERE A LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OF THE SOCIO ECONOMICS THE DIVERSE GENDER EXPRESSIONS AND IDENTITIES EDUCATION LEVELS H. RELIGIOUS AND GEOGRAPHIC DIFFERENCES. OF THE DIFFERENT POCKETS OF OUR COMMUNITIES LITERALLY GO UNADDRESSED IN COUNTY EMERGENCY PLANNING. THIS MEASURE SEEKS TO ADDRESS THAT ISSUE BY REQUIRING COUNTY GOVERNMENT OFFICES OF EMERGENCY SERVICES TO IMPLEMENT CULTURAL COMPETENCE INTO THE NET STOP DATE OF THEIR EMERGENCY PLANS. IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT THE DIVERSE CULTURAL AND LINGUISTIC NEEDS OF ALL OUR RESIDENTS ARE ADDRESSED WE ARE WORKING TOGETHER WITH LOCAL COMMUNITIES IN ORDER TO NARROW THE BILL SO THAT WE REACH THAT LEVEL. OF COMPETENCE -- IN A WAY THAT IS MOST COST EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY THE GOAL IS TO SAVE LIVES TO SAY PROPERTY AND TO MAKE SURE ALL OF THE PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITIES ARE PROTECTED. AND WITH THAT I HAVE WITH ME TODAY PEDRO ROCK ROLL BLISS A COMMUNITY LEADER WITH COST BASED IN VENTURA COUNTY. AND ARMY ROBEL A WOMEN'S POLICY INSTITUTE FELLOW [inaudible] PLEASE. HELLO MY NAME IS PEDRO LISTEN I'M A COMMUNITY LEADER WITH COSTS THE CENTRAL COAST ALLIANCE UNITED FOR A SUSTAINABLE ECONOMY. I AM A SENIOR IN HIGH SCHOOL I WOULD ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT ON SB. ONE SIXTEEN I LIVE IN SANTA PAULA THE CITY WITH THE THOMAS FIRE BROKE OUT IN DECEMBER. TWENTY SEVENTEEN THIS IS A CIRCLE A LOT OF MEDIA ATTENTION BY BEING ONE OF THE BIGGEST BUYERS IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY BUT THE DAMAGE THE SENATE JUST BE ON THE FIRE. THE LACK OF INFORMATION ASSISTANCE AND WARNINGS RECEIVED BY THE COMMUNITY WAS MINIMAL AND ALL HONESTLY TRULY FRIGHTENING. RECREATIONAL OURS THROUGHOUT THE CITY WERE MANDATED HOWEVER MOST FAMILY STAYED IN THEIR HOMES AS BY THE FIRES BURNING SO CLOSE TO THEM. IN MY CASE MY FAMILY DID NOT RECEIVE ANY NOTICES FROM THE COUNTY ABOUT THE FIRE. EVACUATION ROADS OR EVEN REESE WAS LIKE THE SHELTERS. THE REALITY WAS THAT THE ONLY WAY PEOPLE UPDATED WITH THE FIRE WAS A WORD OF MOUTH NEIGHBOR TO NEIGHBOR. NOBODY KNEW WHERE TO GO WHAT TO DO OR HOW TO REACT DURING THIS DISASTER. SADLY YOU MOTHER WAS MORE NOTIFICATION GO INTO THE COMMUNITY THERE WAS NO POWER INTERNET OR EVEN SELL SERVICE DURING THE PEAK OF A DISASTER. PERSONAL HELP SENT TO OUR BLOCKS ARE NEIGHBORHOODS OR COMMUNITIES A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT I KNOW ALSO DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO A CELL PHONE SMARTPHONE WHICH MEANT THEY WERE LEFT OUT OF THE FEW EMERGENCY NOTIFICATIONS THAT WORSE IN TOWN. IF CULTURE THE NEEDS OF COMMUNITIES WERE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION IN THE PLANNING OF EMERGENCIES OR COMMUNITY RESIDENTS. HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO ENGAGE IN THE PLANNING PROCESS OUR COMMUNITY ARE COUNTIES WILL BE BETTER PREPARED TO AID AND SERVE ALL COMMUNITY MEMBERS. DURING DISASTERS AND EMERGENCIES. COMMITTEE MEMBERS ARE THE ACTIONS OF POWER NEIGHBORHOODS FUNCTION AND CLEAN YOU KNOW WHAT THEIR NEEDS ARE WE SHOULD HAVE OPPORTUNITIES TO ENGAGE EMERGENCY PLANNING IN COLLABORATION WITH OUR LOCAL -- YES OF UP MORE OF US EMERGENCY PLAN. TO MAKE SURE IT NEEDS OF LIBERAL COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE ARE NOT FORGOTTEN. OUR COMMITTEES ARE THE FIRST TO SUFFER FROM THESE DISASTERS AND THE LAST RECEIVE HELP. THIS BILL WILL. THIS BILL WILL GIVE OUR COUNTIES THE GUIDANCE THEY NEED TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF US MANY INDIVIDUALS POSSIBLE. COMMUNITY WHERE'S THE PLAYING WASHINGTON THREE COUNTIES EMERGENCY PLANS AND ALLOW THE OFFICES OF EMERGENCY SERVICES THROUGHOUT THE STATE TO CREATE AND EXECUTE BETTER PLAN FUTURE EMERGENCIES. HOW ALSO THE COUNTY EXPECTED TO KNOW THE NEEDS OF COMMUNITIES OF THEY ARE NEVER ENGAGED WITH ONE ANOTHER? I SINCERELY HOPE WHICH ALTHOUGH YES ON THIS BILL AND ARE JUST REGULAR COUNTY EMERGENCY PLANS TO INCLUDE THE NEEDS OF CULTURALLY DIVERSE COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE. THANK YOU [inaudible] WELL DONE. GREAT THE MORNING CHAIR DIED IN COMMITTEE MEMBERS. MY NAME IS AMIR OF ALL SENIOR POLICY RESEARCHER WITH THE ASIAN PACIFIC ENVIRONMENTAL NETWORK OR A PEN. WE SECURE BY MAIL JUSTICE FOR ASIAN AMERICAN IMMIGRANT AND REFUGEE COMMUNITIES. WE ARE PART OF THE CALIFORNIA VIRAL JUSTICE ALLIANCE COSPONSORED THIS BILL ALONG SIDE THE WOMEN'S FOUNDATION OF CALIFORNIA. WE URGE YOU TO VOTE YES ON SB ONE SIXTY FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS. FIRST DISASTER PREPAREDNESS IS IMMINENT. FROM INTENSE STORMS OF CAUSE MUDSLIDES AND FLOODING TO RECORD BREAKING WILD FIRES AND HEAT WAVES. RECENT EVENTS MAKE CLEAR THE DESTRUCTIVE IMPACTS OF CLUB DISASTERS FUELED BY CLIMATE CHANGE. THESE THREATS WILL ONLY INTENSIFY RESULTING IN MAJOR HEALTH AND LIVELIHOOD CONSEQUENCES. THEREFORE IT IS IMPERATIVE TO STRENGTHEN EMERGENCY PROTOCOLS NOW. BY INSURING COUNTIES HAVE THE ASSISTANCE AND RESOURCES TO DO SO [inaudible] SECOND. THIS BILL PRIORITIZES THE NEEDS OF CULTURALLY DIVERSE COMMUNITIES. STORIES LIKE THE ONE JUST SHARED AMPLIFY THE IMPORTANCE OF EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS THAT CENTERS ARE STATES DIVERSE COMMUNITIES. WHEN DISASTERS HIT? EXISTING INEQUALITIES WORSEN. THIS MEANS THAT THOSE MOST IMPACTED ARE CONSISTENTLY THE PEOPLE WITH THE LEAST RESOURCES TO RESPOND WHICH INCLUDES LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES HOMELESS FOLKS THE ELDERLY YOUTH THE DISABLED LGBTQ FOLKS AND OUTDOOR WORKERS. FINALLY COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT CREATES AN OPENING TO DIRECTLY HEAR FROM RESIDENTS ON THE FRONT LINES OF DISASTERS. IT IS CLEAR THAT EACH COUNTY NEEDS A LOCALIZED APPROACH TO EMERGENCIES. PUBLIC MEETINGS COORDINATED ALONGSIDE TRUSTED PARTNERS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS ENSURE THAT COMMUNITY MEMBERS CAN SHARE ISSUES AND IDEAS SPECIFIC TO THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS. THIS COULD INCLUDE ASSISTING COUNTIES WITH PLANNING AFFECTED EVACUATION ROUTES OR DESIGNING SAFE INCLUSIVE EMERGENCY SHELTERS. IT ALSO PROMOTES BROADER AWARENESS ABOUT RESOURCES AND PROTOCOLS ALREADY IN PLACE TO RESPOND. COLLABORATION BETWEEN EMERGENCY PLANNERS RESPONDER IS AND RESIDENTS ALL OF WHOM ARE EXPERTS IS CRITICAL TO ACCOUNTING FOR UNIQUE COMMUNITY NEEDS. ULTIMATELY PROTECTING THE SAFETY OF EVERYONE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR I WILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT.

GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS PAULINA TORE AS WITH THE CENTER AND REYES POWER POVERTY IN THE RAM AND I STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS BILL. HI GOOD MORNING SYLVIA OUT OF ON THE WITH COMMUNITIES FOR A BETTER ENVIRONMENT WE SUPPORT THIS BILL. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS A SEE A MARK HAS BEEN TURNED TWENTY RESIDENT AND I SUPPORT THIS BILL. MORGAN CANYON WITH BREAST CANCER PREVENTION PARTNERS IN SUPPORT. I AM SOVIET GM OAKLAND RESIDENTS SUPPORT THE BILL. IS THERE ANY WITNESSES OPPOSITION I WOULD THINK NOT -- RETURN -- TO THE COMMITTEE CENTER GALGIANI. AND I'M I THINK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD AND I'M WONDERING WHAT SOMEBODY'S EXAMPLES MIGHT LOOK LIKE OF OF COMPLYING WITH THIS BILL I AM I'M SEARCHING MY MIND ABOUT IT AND WONDERING IF. WHAT YOU ENVISION IS PERHAPS HAVING -- COORDINATED COMMUNITY MEETINGS WHERE THE ORGANIZERS ARE ACTUALLY REACHING OUT. TO THE DIFFERENT COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS AND ASKING THEM TO PARTICIPTE. SO THAT. A BROAD NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS AND GROUPS IN THE COMMUNITY HAVE THE ABILITY. TO TALK TO OTHERS IN THEIR IN THEIR ORGANIZATIONS ABOUT THE THE THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT WE ARE HOPING TO DO WE ARE ALSO MINDFUL THAT WE ARE PROBABLY GOING TO BE WORKING WITHIN. A LIMITED FISCAL FRAMEWORK -- SO WE WANT TO MAXIMIZE THEIR PARTICIPATION. BUT AT WHILE MAXIMIZING IT MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE AS SENSITIVE AS WE CAN BE. TWO OF THE COMMUNITY NEEDS AS WELL SO HOPEFULLY WE'LL HAVE A COMMUNITY% RESPONSE I KNOW BECAUSE AS AN ORGANIZATION IN MY DISTRICT DID. VERY WELL REPRESENTS -- THE NEEDS IN THE VALUES OF THE LATINO AND SPANISH SPEAKING COMMUNITIES IN THE DISTRICT WE ALSO ENVISION THAT -- FOR IN OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE WHERE THERE ARE LARGE POPULATIONS OF MYSTICAL OR I KNOW WHEN YOU'RE DISTRICT TO HAVE. FUN I CAN NEVER REMEMBER THE NAME OF BUT OF THE THE GALI IS SAID TO HER. THE THE FILIPINO REPRESENTATION OF OF FOLKS AND THAT WE ENVISION. AREAS IN EACH COMMUNITY WHERE THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT -- A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF PEOPLE -- WITH DIFFERENT CULTURAL -- ISSUES AND THE LANGUAGE ISSUES THAT THEY WILL BE PART OF THIS DISCUSSION SO THAT WHEN WE DO THE OUTRAGE FOR EXAMPLE -- THE SOME COMMUNITIES THE CHURCH IS THE CENTER OF COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE CHURCHES ARE FIRST TO KNOW MAKE SURE THAT. IF POSSIBLE WE CAN HAVE. EMERGENCY -- LOCATION SET UP WITHIN A CHURCH COMMUNITY KNOWING THAT PEOPLE ARE MORE DISPOSED TO A PARTICULAR AREA SOME ARE LESS LIKELY FOR EXAMPLE TO GO TO A SHELTER. IN AN AREA THEY DON'T KNOW OR ARE IT WOULD RATHER STAY CLOSER TO HOME AND TO HAVE THOSE DISCUSSIONS SO THAT WHEN THESE EMERGENCY ROOM. EMERGENCIES ARISE WE HAVE THE BEST WAY TO LET THE TO GIVE THEM AS EARLY NOTICE AS POSSIBLE. AND INSTRUCTIONS AND DIRECTIONS AS TO WHERE THEY CAN GO WHERE THEY'RE COMFORTABLE WHERE THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT THE OPTIONS ARE IN RIGHT NOW FRANKLY WE JUST WE DON'T HAVE THAT. SO THAT'S THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE IN MIND OKAY I AM I ENVISION IS SOMEWHAT LIKE WHEN AS AN ORGAN IT AWHILE BUT A GOVERNMENT ENTITY GOES INTO A COMMUNITY WITH IT. TOO WITH REGARD TWENTY I ARE FOR EXAMPLE IN A LIST WHO THEY REACHED OUT TO WHICH WHICH DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS AND COMMUNITIES AND THEN THEY SORT OF TRACK THAT THROUGH THE PROCESS IT SOUNDS LIKE. THAT SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU'RE ASKING FOR BUT THEN YOU'RE TAKING AT THE EXTRA STEPS AND MAKING SURE THAT WHEN THERE'S EMERGENCY PLANNING. FOR WHEN AN EVENT ACTUALLY OCCURS THAT YOU'RE TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION WHAT IT WOULD BE A CHURCH. RIGHT WE WANT TO GET THAT INPUT FROM THE VARIOUS COMMUNITIES SAYS WHAT IS MOST CULTURALLY. COMFORTABLE ACCEPTABLE RESPONSIVE -- ONE SIZE DOESN'T FIT ALL WE'VE DISCOVERED AND THAT'S THE GOAL HERE IS TO TRY TO ACCOMMODATE AS BEST WE CAN THE NEEDS OF ALL. A DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES WITHIN THE STATE. THANK YOU AND I'D BE HAPPY TO CO AUTHOR THE BILL WITH YOU THANK YOU. SO CAN I ACCEPT THE MOTION FROM YOU -- CENTER GALGIANI YES YOU CAN I'M OF THE BILL THANK YOU VERY MUCH WOULD YOU LIKE. TO CLAIM THINK THESE WITNESSES WERE IS ARTICULATE AND EXPRESS THE NEED AND I THINK WE'VE ALL HAD THESE EXPERIENCES WITHIN OUR COMMUNITY SO WITH THAT I'D RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE THANK YOU SENATOR -- THIS -- THIS ENJOYS A DO PASS RECOMMENDATION.

FIVE TWO ZERO HOLDEN THE BILL HAS FIVE WILL HOLD IT OPEN FOR THE ABSENT MEMBERS THANK YOU SENATOR THANK YOU MISTER CARE AND THANK YOU MEMBERS. MRS HERE HURTS. MY SENSE HERE SO WE'LL CENTER HUESO ITEM NINE FIVE ITEM NINE SB. FIVE FIVE EIGHT THE MORNING Q. THANK YOU MISTER GOOD MORNING MEMBERS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ALLOWING ME -- TO PRESENT AS P.. FIVE FIVE EIGHT A BILL THAT WOULD CREATE A COMMISSION OF CALIFORNIA MEXICO AFFAIRS. THE IDEA OF THIS BILL IS TO ACTIVATE THE VERY DIVERSE CITIZENRY OF CAL OF CALIFORNIA PEOPLE THAT ARE ENGAGING IN EDUCATION AND BUSINESS AND EVERY EVERY LEVEL OF ADVOCACY. AND CALIFORNIA'S VERY DIVERSE AS A SOCIETY. THE IDEA IS TO CREATE. A COMMISSION THAT WILL INTERFACE WITH OTHER OTHR LEADERS AND OTHER -- BUSINESS PEOPLE IN MEXICO -- FOR THE PURPOSES OF BRINGING OR STATES CLOSER CLOSER-TOGETHER AND USING THESE COMMISSIONS -- SO VEHICLE TO DEVELOP. POLICY AT THE CITIZEN LEVEL -- TO BRING TO THE LEGISLATURE EVENTUALLY THAT WOULD BE THE GOAL. TO TO HELP GET. A TALENTED PEOPLE IN OUR STATE TO HELP US SOLVE OUR PROBLEMS AND AND CREATE BRIDGES AND OF HELP US GROW OUR RELATIONSHIP. WITH WITH MEXICO THAT IS SO IMPORTANT. THE CALIFORNIA MEXICO BORDER REGION IS HOME TO SIX POINT FOUR MILLION PEOPLE. AND GENERATES TWENTY FOUR POINT THREE BILLION IN ECONOMIC ACTIVITY -- THIS UP BORDER IS DYNAMIC -- MANY THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ACROSS THE BORDER EVERY DAY -- LOTS OF THINGS ARE HAPPENING -- TOURISM -- EXCHANGE CULTURAL EXCHANGES WE ALSO ON AN ECONOMIC LEVEL ARE PRODUCING THINGS TOGETHER. OFTENTIMES A PRODUCT THAT -- BEGINS ITS PRODUCTION IN CALIFORNIA GOES INTO MEXICO. TO BE FURTHER -- DEVELOPED AND COMES BACK TO CALIFORNIA TO BE FINISHED. THERE ARE MANY. WAYS THAT WERE WORKING TOGETHER. AND TOGETHER OUR STATE EXPORTS TO MEXICO -- BUT JUST OUR STATE TO EXPORT TO LOAN TOTAL TWENTY SIX POINT. EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS AND THAT HAS BEEN GROWING. I EVERY SUCCESS OF YOUR AS CALIFORNIA'S HAVE BECOME A LITTLE MORE -- INTERESTED IN IN COMMUNICATING AND CREATING BRIDGES WITH MEXICO THAT NUMBER IS GOING UP. TODAY TRADE WITH MEXICO POST. TRADE WITH MEXICO SUPPORTS FIVE HUNDRED AND SIXTY SIX THOUSAND JOBS IN CALIFORNIA. THAT'S A LOT OF JOBS. BUT WE CAN DO A LOT MORE. AND THE IDEA IS TO CREATE -- OF A STRONGER OF FABRIC IN OUR SOCIETY THAT INTERFACES WITH MEXICO THAT CREATES MORE JOBS THAT -- BRINGS US CLOSER TOGETHER IN A WAY THAT ALLOWS FOR OUR MUTUAL PROSPERITY I OFTEN TELL PEOPLE AS CALIFORNIAN AND MEXICO'S. ECONOMY GROWS IT BENEFITS US BOTH IT IT LEADS TO MORE JOBS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE BORDER. AND I THINK THAT'S WE SHOULD WHICH WE SHOULD BE FOCUSING ON HELPING TO IMPROVE OUR ARC -- NOT ONLY OUR OWN ECONOMY BUT BY IMPROVING OUR ECONOMY WE CAN HELP -- IMPROVE MEXICO'S ECONOMY IN OTHER LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES FOR THAT FOR THAT MATTER AS WELL -- WE ARE ARE FAR BEHIND OTHER STATES IN IN OUR PARK PER CAPITA INVOLVEMENT WITH MEXICO AND JUST WHAT I THINK WE HAVE A LOT MORE OFFER TEXAS EXPORTS. EXPORTS WITH MEXICO OUT DID OURS BY SEVENTY BILLION DOLLARS THAT'S JUST A IN ADDITION TO WHAT WE'VE DONE. ESTABLISHING A COMMISSION ON CALIFORNIA MEXICO AFFAIRS CAN HELP US ACTIVATE THE FULL SET OF BENEFITS THAT COME WITH A STRONG CALIFORNIA MEXICO PARTNERSHIP AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE TODAY FOR THIS. PROPOSAL. THANK YOU SENATOR -- OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. TURN BACK TO US. THE COMMITTEE SENATOR -- RUBIO. THE BILL. WE HAVE A MOTION ANYBODY ELSE -- I JUST HAD A COMMENT WE USED TO HAVE THE OFFICE OF TRADE AND COMMERCE AND DO YOU ENVISION -- GETTING DELVING INTO THAT AREA SOME ABOUT WHAT ARE OUR TRADE -- ISSUES ARE AND HOW THAT'S WORKING WITH THIS COMMITTEE. IN AND MY HOPE IS THAT THOSE ISSUES WOULD BE ADDRESSED. THAT BY PUTTING PEOPLE IN THERE WITH AN INTEREST IN THAT AREA THAT THE BUT I I WOULD LIKE -- THE A COMMISSION TO DEAL WITH KIND OF A BROAD RANGE OF ISSUES OFTENTIMES. THERE ARE SOME SAFETY ISSUES OTHERS TRANSPORTATION ISSUES ENVIRONMENTAL. THEIR BUSINESS ISSUES AND EDUCATION AS WELL CULTURAL AND I THINK WE ESTABLISH A A VERY DIVERSE. BOARD I THINK ALL ALL THAT GROUP. WILL TAKE AN INTEREST IN THOSE ISSUES AND MOVE AN AGENDA THAT THAT WILL DEAL WITH. THE ISSUE OF THE DAY AS IT DEALS WITH OUR RELATIONS WITH MEXICO BUT ESTABLISH IN THE COMMISSION WILL SEND A VERY CLEAR MESSAGE THE CALIFORNIA. HIS IS A SEIZE MEXICO AS AN ALLY AS A FRIEND. AND WE WANT TO SORT OUT THE CHALLENGES THAT DEAL WITH OUR OUR RESPECTIVE COMMUNITIES THERE ARE MANY. AND I REMEMBER WHEN I FIRST GOT ELECTED TO THE COUNCIL THAT WAS SO ONE REPRESENTING JUST THE BORDER -- IN THE MAYOR'S OFFICE CAME TO ME AND SAID THESE ARE THE DEAL THE ISSUES WE'RE DEALING WITH AT THIS MOMENT. IT WAS A REALLY REALLY LONG LIST AND MOST OF THOSE ISSUES ARE DIFFICULT. BUT I THINK MOST OF THE I WOULD I WOULD SAY THAT IT CAUGHT ME BY SURPRISE AND AND AND THOSE THOSE CHALLENGES WILL WILL CONTINUE. BUT THERE IS A NOTHING STOPPING OF FROM SOME SOLVING SOME OF THEM AS WE AS WE GO ALONG AND AND AND SERVING THE PEOPLE. OF OUR STATE BY DOING SO AND I THINK THE COMMISSION WOULD GO A LONG WAY TO HELPING. LEGISLATORS -- UNDERSTAND THE CHALLENGES AND HAVING A CITIZENS COMMISSION -- EX YOU KNOW BE AN EXTENSION OF OUR LEGISLATURE BECAUSE OF YOU KNOW. AS MUCH AS I TRY. TO WORK WITH WITH WITH MEXICO THEY'RE JUST NOT ENOUGH HOURS OF THE DAY. AND AND WE CAN WE NEED HELP. AND WE NEED TO PUT MORE RESOURCES INTO THIS AND THIS WOULD BE A VERY COST EFFECTIVE WAY TO MOVE. A LARGE AGENDA ON A DAILY BASIS. CENTER ALL TAKE THAT IS YOUR CLOTHES YES. YEAH WE DO HAVE A MOTION BY SENATOR RUBIO WITH A DO PASS RECOMMENDATION FROM THE CHAIR CAN COR CALL THE ROLL PLEASE. FILE ITEM NINE SB FIVE FIVE EIGHT MOTION IS DUE PASSED TO APPROPRIATIONS DODD. I DODD AYE WILK [inaudible] ALLEN [inaudible] ARCHULETA [inaudible] BOARD YES [inaudible] BRADFORD [inaudible] CHIANG. GALGIANI GALGIANI AYE GLAZER HILL. HELLO HI WESSEL I WAS SO I'D JONES [inaudible] NIELSEN [inaudible] PORTANTINO. RUBIO HI RUBIO AYE WIENER. THE BILL HAS FIVE VOTES WILL HOLD ROLE OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR. SENATOR JOHN. SENATOR JONES HERE. LET'S SEE HIM WHERE WE WE HAVE ANYBODY. WIENER WILKINS CALLING NO WELCOME. SERVER WILL HERE ON PEOPLE. YOU HAVE PEOPLE I'VE GOT PEOPLE TESTIFYING I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU PEOPLE. GOOD THROUGH EVERYTHING. NO JUST -- YEAH. I TELL PEOPLE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND AND MEMBERS -- TODAY I PRESENT SB. FIVE FIVE THREE WHICH IS SUFFICES MORE COMPANIES TO BECOME A 100% EMPLOYEE OWNED. I PROVIDING MORE CALIFORNIA'S WITH A GREATLY ENHANCED PATHWAY -- TO TO RETIREMENT SECURITY. ABOUT SEVEN AND A HALF MILLION CALIFORNIA WORKERS. WORK FOR AN EMPLOYER THEY DOES NOT OFFER A RETIREMENT PLAN. NEARLY HALF OF ALL PRIVATE BUSINESSES ARE OWNED BY BABY BOOMERS MEANING THAT AS AN OLD AS A OLDER AMERICANS AGE OUT OF THE WORK FORCE. MANY FAMILY AND LOCALLY OWNED COMPANIES WILL SOON CHANGE HANDS. RETIRING BUSINESS OWNERS. COULD SIT CELL TO COMPETITOR PRIVATE EQUITY GO PUBLIC OR SIMPLY CLOSER CLOSER DOORS. BUT THEY CAN ALSO -- CONVERT TO AN EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN AND SELL THAT COMPANY TO THEIR EMPLOYEES. AND AESOP IS AN OWNERSHIP RETIREMENT PLAN WHICH THE COMPANY CONTRIBUTES IN STOCK OR MONEY TO BUY ITS STOCK. TO THE PLAN FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE COMPANY'S OWNER SLASH EMPLOYEES. MORE THAN THREE THOUSAND EASE SOPS -- TOGETHER EMPLOYED NEARLY FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THOUSAND WORKERS IN THE COUNTRY IN NEARLY EIGHT HUNDRED OF THOSE COMPANIES ARE LOCATED IN CALIFORNIA. 65% OF THE SUBS ARE ALSO PROVIDE A SECOND RETIREMENT INCOME LIKE US FOR A ONE K. WERE UNION PENSION. WHEREAS ONLY 44% OF U. S. BUSINESSES OFFER ANY RETIREMENT PLAN AT ALL. SB FIVE FIVE THREE REQUIRES A STATE AGENCY AWARDING PUBLIC WORK CONTRACTS TO PROVIDE A 3% BID PREFERENCE AT THE EAST SIDE BITTER IS A HIGHER PERCENT OWNED AND OPERATED. BY EMPLOYEE OWNERS AND THE COMPANY DEMONSTRATES A DEMONSTRATES COMPLIANCE WITH IRS REGULATIONS. WORKERS AT PRIVATE EMPLOYER EMPLOYEE OWNED COMPANIES HAVE MORE STABLE JOBS BETTER WAGES AND ENHANCE RETIREMENT SECURITY. EMPLOYEE OWNED COMPANIES KEEP -- PROFITS IN THE STATE AND USE THAT MONEY TO BUILD WEALTH FOR WORKING PEOPLE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. BY ADDING A PREFERENCE FOR HE SOUGHT COMPANIES TO STAY WILL INCREASE WELL TO RETIRED CALIFORNIANS TO PRIVATE FUNDING. LIMITED DEPENDENCE ON PUBLIC RETIREMENT ANY INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD THAT RETIRED CALIFORNIANS STAY HERE IN CALIFORNIA THROUGH AN IMPROVED EMPLOYEE PRODUCTIVITY. IT WILL PROVIDE CALIFORNIA WITH BETTER STRONGER FIRMS AND EMPLOYEE STABILITY SO WITH ME TODAY SO WITNESSES MICHAEL SMITH IS A TWENTY PLUS YEAR EMPLOYEE SLASH OWNER. AND SAFETY MANAGER OF A PAYMENT RECYCLING SOLUTIONS [inaudible] THANK YOU. THAT ON HELLO MY NAME IS MICHAEL SMITH I AM ON I SAID A TWENTY TWO YEAR PROUD. EMPLOYEE OWNER OF PAYMENT RECYCLING SYSTEMS AND I'M HERE TODAY REPRESENTING ANOTHER THREE HUNDRED PLUS EMPLOYEE OWNERS OF PAPER RECYCLING SYSTEM IN OUR SUPPORT. FOR SB. FIVE FIFTY THREE AT FAVOR RECYCLING SYSTEMS. ESAU IS WHAT DRIVES OUR COMPANY YOU STOP IS PROMOTED FROM THE BEGINNING FROM THE DAY YOU'RE HIRED IN THE DAY OR BROUGHT INTO THE COMPANY WAS PROMOTED ON ALL OF OUR BUSINESS ITEMS ALL OF OUR BIDS. IT'S A DAILY -- DISCUSSION WITH OUR FIELD THIS ON OUR BASSES ON EVERYTHING WE DO WE PROMOTE HE SAW. STOP REMOTES LOYAL WORKERS STRONG WORKERS WE HAVE NO TURN OVER VERY LITTLE TURNOVER ONCE ONCE YOU STOP ONCE PEOPLE REALIZE THE VALUE OF THE NISSAN. AND TO BE AN EMPLOYEE OWNER THEY TEND TO STAY WITH US WHICH MAKES US A STRONGER COMPANY. EVERY PERSON IN OUR COMPANY FROM THE PERSON RUNNING PARTS IN THE SHOP. TO THE PEOPLE THAT PUT OUT THE BIDS TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE COMPANY IS AN EQUAL PARTNER IN EMPLOYEE OWNERSHIP THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT WORK. FOR ME THE SOP BECAME A REALITY SIXTEEN YEARS AGO WHEN MY WIFE AND I OPEN UP OF OUR HOME TO FOSTER CARE. AND ENDED UP ADOPTING THREE YOUNG CHILDREN. MY DAUGHTER GRACE WAS THREE AT THE TIME IN THE SYSTEM FOR TWO AND A HALF YEARS. MY SON DAVID TWO MONTHS LATER A KNOCK ON THE DOOR AND A PHONE CALL WE RECEIVED ANOTHER NEWBORN INFANT -- WHO WAS A SIBLING TO MY DAUGHTER GRACE? FIVE YEARS AFTER THE ADOPTION SAID PLACE AND THROUGH A LOT OF MEDICAL PROBLEMS THAT WE'RE HAPPENED WE WERE TOLD THAT GRAYSON ERIN. AT AUTISM. AND THAT WOULD REQUIRE A LITTLE BIT MORE HELP THAN JUST TO SUPPORT OF MY WIFE BEING A STAY AT HOME MOM. MY WIFE WOULD NOW BECOME A STAY HOME MOM AND AN ADVOCATE TO GET MY KIDS THE EDUCATION THAT THEY NEED. AT THAT AGE MY WIFE AND I AGE A LITTLE OLDER MOST OF THE PEOPLE THAT WE KNEW AND OUR FRIENDS WERE GRADUATING THEIR KIDS FROM HIGH SCHOOL AND WE'RE LOOKING TO EMPTY NEST SYNDROME. AND HOW TO SUPPORT GET READY FOR RETIREMENT SO IT WAS A LITTLE SCARY FOR US AS WE KNEW MY WIFE WOULD NEVER COME BACK INTO. THE WORK FORCE AND IT WOULD JUST BE MY INCOME. TEN YEARS AGO OUR STOCK FOR THE EAST UP CAME OUT IN MY STOCK ACCOUNT IN THE SUB THOUSAND DOLLARS AT THAT TIME. THAT DID A LOT TO EASE OUR MIND IN THE START WITH OUR KIDS A LITTLE CLOSER. FAST FORWARD TO THIS LAST DECEMBER AND ARE YOU STOP SHAREHOLDERS MEETING OUR CHRISTMAS PARTY. MY WIFE AND I OPEN OUR STOCK CERTIFICATE AND WE WERE NOW MILLIONAIRES. THAT IN TWENTY FOUR YEARS OF PUTTING SWELLED UP FOR DOING NOTHING BUT SHOWN UP AND DOING MY JOB AND BEING A GOOD EMPLOYEE AND PROMOTING OUR YOU SOFTEN OUR OWNERSHIP. WE WERE NOT COMFORTABLE AND WE KNEW THAT WOULD BE FINE. WHAT THAT DOES FOR ME AS SIXTY ONE YEARS OLD NOW IS A GIVES ME THAT OPPORTUNITY? TO BE ABLE TO RETIRE THEN TAKE THAT BURDEN OFF MY WIFE SHOULDER AND CONTINUE EDUCATING MY KIDS. MAYBE PROMOTING THE SOP WITH MY KIDS BY IN THE BUSINESS HELPING THEM BECOME BETTER IN SOCIETY. SB FIVE FIFTY THREE WE'RE OPEN WILL ALSO OPEN THE EYES OF MANY OTHER CONTRACTORS TO LOOK INTO THE SOP TO PROMOTE THAT HE'S UP TO THAT RETIREMENT SO THAT MORE MORE PEOPLE CAN RETIRE. WITH THIS NEST EGG THAT THEY'RE NOT A BURDEN ON THE FAMILY OR STATE. SO WITH THAT. I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME -- I ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. THURMOND ODD -- STEVE WARD -- I'D LIKE TO VOICE SUPPORT ON BEHALF OF CERTIFIED EMPLOYEE OWNED. AND ESCA. EMPLOYEE S. CORPSE OF AMERICA. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THANK YOU. ANY WITNESSES OPPOSITION.

ZERO GIVE YOU CAN ADDRESSES ISN'T A MILD CONCERN THAT -- ADDING ONE MORE PREFERENCE -- IN THE STATE CONTRACTING WATERS DOWN SOME OF THE OTHER PREFERENCES CAN YOU JUST ADDRESS THAT REAL QUICK. SURE I SO WHEN THE REASON WHY WE CHOSE -- 3% SAID 5% SO NOT TO COMPETE WITH DISABLED. DENOTE DINO DISABLED -- THAT VENDORS AND SO THE WHOLE POINT IT AM I LAST YEAR WE PASSED A A BIT PRESS -- BID PREFERENCE FOR THOSE COMPANIES THAT OFFER HEALTH CARE INSURANCE SO CERTAINLY THE PRESIDENT IS SET. I USED TO BE -- PART OF ANY SOCKS -- TWENTY YEARS AGO AND I KNOW HOW IT MOTIVATES EMPLOYEES AND IT CREATES WEALTH AND WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS TO PAY OFF IN THIS BUILDING. WE USE DISINCENTIVES TO GET PEOPLE TO DO THE RIGHT RIGHT THING THIS IS AN AN INCENTIVE TO GET PEOPLE DO THE RIGHT THING WHICH I THINK WILL. MAKE EMPLOYEES OWNERS AND AND AND MORE ENGAGED IN THE BUSINESS WORK HARDER. CREATE MORE WEALTH AND THAT THEY WILL BE ABLE TO THEN YOU KNOW SHARE IN THE IN THE FRUIT OF THEIR LABOR SO I THINK THIS OF A VERY SMART STRATEGY -- QUESTION THE WITNESS THAT HOW MANY EMPLOYEES IN YOUR FIRM. WE ARE OVER THREE HUNDRED FIFTY ROUND. THREE SEVENTY FIVE YEAH AB ANYBODY ELSE WATCHING IF IF I COULD MISTER CHAIR AND I'VE ALWAYS BEEN FOND OF THE SHOPS OF I'VE BEEN AWARE OF THEM FOR MANY YEARS AND FIND THEM TO BE QUITE SUCCESSFUL ON ANOTHER A NUMBER OF ISSUES RAISED IN THE ANALYSIS THAT I CERTAINLY.

CATCH MY BREATH RAN THE FIRST TWO YEARS -- SO YOU KNOW. THERE'S NO SPONSOR THIS BILL WHICH I KINDA LIKE. LIKE SPONSORED BILLS TOO MUCH BUT THE HONEST INSPIRATIONS MY CHIEF OF STAFF WAS A SCIENCE FELLOW. WHO'S GOT A PHD IN THEORETICAL PHYSICS. HE'S WELL AS ALBERT EINSTEIN TYPE PEOPLE. AND CAME UP WITH THIS IDEA THANKS PRETTY COOL -- FOR A STEM GLORIA [inaudible] BASICALLY. WE ENGAGE IN ALL THESE VARIOUS EFFORTS IN GOVERNMENT TO TRY. TO YOU KNOW DEAL WITH SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY ENGINEERING AND MATHEMATICS. AND THE IDEA I THINK THE CORE OF IT IS IN ESSENCE WAS TRIMMING MEMBERS. THAT. WE HAVE WE RESPECT THOSE IDEAS. IAN -- THE FORM OF DESIGNATING THIS. I HAVE IS YOU SHOULD HAVE IN YOUR PACKET. A WHOLE BUNCH OF LETTERS TO SENATOR ASOS DISTRICT FROM SCHOOL CENTERS -- DROSS IS DISTRICT -- SUPPORTING THIS IDEA. OF A CALIFORNIA LAUREATE OF STEM -- FOR FOR THE GOVERNMENT SO. CERTAINLY WE KNOW THAT WE'VE HAD A LOT OF NOBEL LAUREATES HERE IN CALIFORNIA EIGHTY FIVE IN FACT. AND FIFTY RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY FIVE WHICH ARE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. SO THE IDEA IS JUST PHILOSOPHICALLY BEING CONSISTENT WITH THESE CORE VALUES THAT HAVE BEEN A CORNERSTONE OF SO MUCH INNOVATION OF CALIFORNIA. SO MUCH OF WHAT EFFORTS HAVE BEEN PUT IN -- EDUCATION COMMITTEES AND WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO SO WE THOUGHT THIS WAS KIND OF A NICE COMPLIMENT TO THAT LARGER DYNAMIC IN WITH THAT. A TWO OVER TO MY GREAT WITNESS. GOOD MORNING CHAIRED TEAR DODD AND AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS AMBER MAY SIGNED THE INTERIM EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA COUNCIL ON SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY OR C. C. S. T.. AND WE ARE A NONPARTISAN NONPROFIT WE WE WERE CREATED AT THE REQUEST OF THE LEGISLATURE SO WE DON'T TAKE POSITIONS ON BILLS BUT I'M VERY VERY HAPPY TO BE HERE. TO TALK ABOUT SCIENCE AND THE IMPORTANCE OF SCIENCE IN THE WORK THAT YOU DO IN THE IN THE WORK OF CALIFORNIA. AND SCIENCE FOR SOCIETY SO CALIFORNIA IS HOME TO MANY WORLD CLASS ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS AND RESEARCH FACILITIES. AND WE PARTNER WITH THEM VERY CLOSELY TO HELP BRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN SCIENCE AND POLICY THROUGH A SUITE OF SERVICES THAT WE BRING TO YOU BRIEFINGS STUDIES AND OF COURSE ARE CCSD SCIENCE FELLOWS. THANKS TO THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE BEEN MENTORS TO THEM. AND WE SEE THAT THERE'S A STRONG DESIRE IN FACT AN UNENDING NEED FOR SCIENTISTS TO COMMUNICATE WITH WITH AUDIENCES OF ALL LEVELS. TO SHOW WHO SCIENTISTS ARE AND THE BRING THE VALUE OF SCIENCE TO ALL OF THE PROBLEMS THAT WE FACE AS A SOCIETY. SO IT'S PUBLIC RESEARCH THAT WE RELY ON TO SOLVE THESE COMPLEX ISSUES THAT CALIFORNIA FACES IT'S ALSO PUBLIC OUTREACH BY SCIENTISTS THAT IS AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT TO OPENING THE DOORS TO STEM CAREERS WE NEED THIS PIPELINE OF THE SCIENCE SAVVY STUDENTS. WHO ARE GOING TO HELP US SOLVE THESE PROBLEMS THAT WE FACE AS A SOCIETY? AND SO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE STUDENTS GET TO MEET SCIENTISTS FIRST HAND AND IT'S WHEN THEY MEET THE SCIENTISTS IN PERSON THEY SEE THAT ANYONE CAN BE A SCIENTIST. AND THAT SCIENTISTS CAN DO ANYTHING WHETHER AS A HIGH SCHOOL CHEMISTRY TEACHER AS AN ASSEMBLY MEMBER OR SENATOR OR AS A RESEARCHER. THE MYSTERIES OF THE UNIVERSE. SO WE KNOW THAT OUR REACH TAKES TIME IT'S OFTEN PRO BONO IT'S OFTEN UNRECOGNIZED AND UNSUPPORTED THAT'S WHY US DUMB LAURIE IT IS THE TYPE OF POSITION THAT REALLY. ELEVATES THE ROLE OF SCIENCE AND GIVES SCIENCE OF VOICE TO INSPIRE THOSE WHO ARE COMING UP AND WHO WILL BE OUR FUTURE LEADERS. THERE IS AN URGENT NEED TO EXPAND AND SOLIDIFY A STRONG ROLE FIRST STEM IN OUR SOCIETY CALIFORNIA ALWAYS AT THE FOREFRONT OF THESE ISSUES AND WE SHOULD CONTINUE TO PLAY A LEADING ROLE. IT'S VITAL THAT SCIENTISTS WHO DEDICATE TIME TO SCIENCE COMMUNICATION AND PUBLIC OUTREACH ARE RECOGNIZED. BECAUSE THEIR EFFORTS ARE ESSENTIAL THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE SHOULD TAKE ALL OPPORTUNITIES TO AFFIRM. THAT THE STATE VALUES STEM CAREERS AND THAT CALIFORNIA AND CALIFORNIANS ARE STRONGER WITH SCIENCE THANK YOU THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING ERIN RODRIGUEZ WITH UNION OF CONCERNED SCIENTISTS WE ALSO THINK SCIENCE IS REALLY IMPORTANT -- ESPECIALLY OUR DEMOCRACY AND IT'S OFF SOME OF OUR REALLY PRESSING FRAUD PROBLEMS ORDERS BE SEEN SO I'M FOR INSTRUCTS FOR THANKS.

HE'S YOU KNOW AND IT'S I REALLY I'M A BELIEVER THE QUESTION I NEED SOME DIAGNOSTIC HERE AS TO WHETHER OR NOT. I MEAN CERTAINLY HAVE SOMEBODY IN THE ARTS WORLD WE HAVE A POET LAUREATE. AND IN THE ARTS WORLD IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT MUCH ORGANIC BELIEVER THE QUESTION I I NEED SOME DIAGNOSTIC ON IT WAS JUST REYES TO ME. IS WHETHER OR NOT YOU NEED -- TO VERSES THE IDEA OF THE FOCUS ON SCIENCE I COULD SEE BILL NYE THE SCIENCE GUY IS PROBABLY THE RICHEST PERSON BUT YOU KNOW TO NOT THE FUSE ONE VERSUS THE OTHER WE HAVE A SITUATION WHERE. THE REPORTS ESTIMATE THAT WE HAVE A MILLION MORE STEM PROFESSIONALS THAT REQUIRE IN THE NEXT DECADE THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES. IN THE WITH THE LOOT THAT EMPHASIS WOULD GET BOTH WITH ART AND WITH RESPECT TO SCIENCE SO THAT'S THE ONLY QUESTION I REYES LOOK I'D LOVE I'M ALL IN YOU KNOW FOR THE ARTS PEACE. BUT MAYBE IT SHOULD BE SOMETHING SEPARATE SOME OF YOU HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT IT I HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT IT. I LIVE THIS MY LIFE LIKE YOU KNOW IT'S KIND OF COOL. RIGHT JUST ON THE CLOSE THIS IS BASICALLY NOT SO MEMBERS THE USE USE THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT WILL CHOOSE THE NOMINEES. NOMINEES THEY SERVE FOR TWO YEARS APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR -- A KIND OF SIMILAR TO THE NOBEL LAUREATE BUT SOMETHING THAT REALLY EMPHASIZES WHAT ABOUT MY STATEMENT ABOUT WHO WE ARE CALIFORNIA HOPEFULLY OTHER STATES AND THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT.

SEVEN FORTY EIGHT THE YOUTH POET LAUREATE BILL. GRATEFUL TO SENATOR STERN ALONG WITH SENATORS ALAN AND HERTZBERG FOR AUTHORING THIS BILL. THE CALIFORNIA ARTS COUNCIL SUBMITTED A FORMAL REQUEST TO THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE TO BRING LEGISLATION TO ESTABLISH A CALIFORNIA POET LAUREATE. WILL BE APPOINTED BY GOVERNOR NEW SOME. AND CONFIRMED BY SENATE FROM A LIST OF THREE NOMINEES. THERE WILL BE PROVIDED BY THE ARTS COUNCIL THROUGH A SPECIFIC PROCESS. THE CALIFORNIA POET LAUREATE. IS IS SOMETHING. THERE HAS BEEN TREMENDOUSLY SUCCESSFUL AND I WOULD LOVE TO TO EXTEND IT TO THE YOUTH IN THIS STATE. BECAUSE IT LENDS THEM AGENCY. I AM THROUGH MY EXPERIENCE AS AN EDUCATOR I'VE SEEN OVER AND OVER AGAIN HOW POWERFUL THE EXPERIENCES WHEN YOUNG PEOPLE SEE ONE OF THEIR PEERS CREATING. AND BEING CELEBRATED AND VALUED IN THIS CASE AS A POET. THE POET LAUREATE. WOULD HAVE A MISSION TO ADVOCATE FOR THE ART OF POETRY. IN CLASSROOMS AND COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE TO INSPIRE AND EMERGING GENERATION OF LITERARY ARTISTS AND TO EDUCATE ALL CALIFORNIANS ABOUT THE MANY POETS AND AUTHORS WHO HAVE INFLUENCED. OUR GREAT STATE THROUGH CREATIVE LITERARY EXPRESSION. I'M HERE TODAY WITH THE CALIFORNIA ARTS COUNCIL'S DIRECTOR OF LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS. KRISTIN MARGOLIS YOU CAN HE AND SHE WILL TELL YOU MORE ABOUT THE POET THAT WE BROUGHT WITH US TODAY. AND ABOUT THE LEGISLATION. THANK YOU SO MUCH. CHAIRMAN DIED I JUST WANNA TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT -- WHY WE ARE SO LUCKY TO HAVE AN ITALIAN HERE SO SHE PARTICIPATED IN POETRY OUT LOUD -- AND THIS YEAR WE HAD FIFTY THREE COUNTIES THAT PARTICIPATED -- WITH OVER FORTY THOUSAND STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA SO AT THE INTEREST IN. READING POETRY -- IS IS HUGE AMONG KIDS THAT ARE IN TIS AGE RANGE -- THIRTEEN TO NINETEEN THAT PARTICULAR CONTEST IS ABOUT READING OTHER POETRY SO IT'S ONE PRE TWENTIETH CENTURY UPON AND ONE POEM THAT MAYBE CURRENT DAY AND THEN THEY'RE ABLE TO SELECT FROM ANOTHER POEM OUT OF EIGHT HUNDRED HOMES THAT ARE ON A WEBSITE. BUT THE UPON THAT YOU HEARD ITALIAN RECITE TODAY AS PART OF A PROGRAM CALLED POETRY OURSELVES WHICH IS AN OFFSHOOT OF POETRY OUT LOUD AND IT'S THE FIRST YEAR THAT WE'VE ACTUALLY DONE THAT PROGRAM -- WITH CALIFORNIA ARTS COUNCIL AS AN OFFSHOOT OF POETRY OUT LOUD AND SO. THAT HOME IS WHAT SHE SAID MATED -- TO THAT CONTEST AND THERE ARE MANY OTHER STUDENTS WERE VERY INTERESTED IN DOING THAT. AND IT'S REALLY RAISE THE AWARENESS -- OF THE CALIFORNIA ARTS COUNCIL MEMBERS THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE YOUTH POET LAUREATES. I ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT POINT OUT TO YOU THAT WE THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT THE GOVERNOR MAKES HIS APPOINTMENT BASED ON THE FACT THAT. THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE ALSO INTERESTED IN PARTICIPATING IN PUBLIC SERVICE AND SO BY SERVING AS A YOUTH POET LAUREATE THEY WOULD HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY -- AND I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO IDENTIFY THESE YOUNG WRITERS AND LITERARY SCHOLARS -- SO THAT THEY CAN BE COMMITTED TO CIVIC AND COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AS WELL. pWE THINK SENATOR STERN VERY MUCH FOR BRINGING THIS BILL.

WE HAVE WORD SENATOR WIENER IS -- SETTING UP BILL IN ITS ON THE OPPOSITION SIDE NOW SO -- HURRY UP AND WAIT -- WE HAVE AN ITEM NUMBER FOUR SB. ONE THE LAST BILL OF THE DAY FOR THIS COMMITTEE -- CENTER WIENER GOOD MORNING. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU FOR WAITING. ALL GOOD. MORNING THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. FIRST I WANT TO THANK GOD THE CHAIR AND COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH US CLOSELY ON THE BILL -- TO IMPROVE MECHANICS -- OF THE BILL WE APPRECIATE THAT -- WERE COMMITTED TO CONTINUE TO WORK TOGETHER -- AND I'M HAPPY TO ACCEPT OUR AMENDMENTS ONE FOUR AND FIVE LISTED IN THE ANALYSIS -- GOING FORWARD WE WILL WORK WITH THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE ON AMENDMENTS TO AND THREE RELATING TO COST ISSUES SO WE APPRECIATE THE WORK WITH US AND YOUR FLEXIBILITY -- AND HELPING WITH THE BELT -- COLLEAGUES -- SB TWO EIGHTY ONE IS FUNDAMENTALLY A LOCAL BILL THAT WILL DO TWO THINGS -- NUMBER ONE IT WILL -- AND GUN SHOWS AT THE COW PALACE WHICH IS LOCATED IN DALY CITY -- WITH A LITTLE BIT OF IT CROSSING OVER IN SAN FRANCISCO -- AND IT WILL ALSO -- CREATE A LOCAL DECISION MAKING -- ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THE CAL PALACE ONSITE. I WANT TO KNOW -- THAT FIRST OF ALL THIS BILL IS A CO AUTHORED BY EVERY SINGLE MEMBER. OF THE LEGISLATURE WHO REPRESENTS EITHER CEMETERY COUNTY OR SAN FRANCISCO ALL SIX OF US THANK YOU CENTER HILL FOR YOUR CO AUTHORSHIP. IT ALSO ENJOYS -- UNANIMOUS SUPPORT FROM THE DALY CITY COUNCIL -- I THAT WAS FOR SOME REASON I IN THE ANALYSIS OR THEY DID SUBMIT A LETTER -- UNANIMOUS SUPPORT FROM THE SAN FRANCISCO BOARD OF SUPERVISORS SUPPORT FROM THE MAYOR OF SAN FRANCISCO LONDON BREED -- AND WE HAD THE CEMETERY COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS WILL BE VOTING ON ENDORSING THE BILL TODAY -- THE DISTRICT SUPERVISORS FURTHER CANNOT BUT WHO ALSO SUBMITTED A LETTER SUPPORT OF THE BILL -- THIS IS NOT CONTROVERSIAL LOCALLY AND WHAT THIS. REALLY SPRINGS FROM AND THE REASON WHY THIS BILL IS NOT CONTROVERSIAL LOCALLY. UNANIMOUS VOTES UNANIMOUS DELEGATION SUPPORT IS BECAUSE FOR MANY MANY YEARS -- THE CAL PALACE AND ITS BOARD OF DIRECTORS -- HAVE BEEN ENTIRELY ON RESPONSIVE. TO THE NEEDS OF THE LOCAL COMMUNITY. THE I KNOW EVERYONE IS FAMILIAR WITH THE GUN SHOW ISSUE THAT. FOR MANY MANY YEARS THE LOCAL COMMUNITY HAS BEEN ASKING THE CAL PALACE TO STOP PUTTING ON GUN SHOWS IN THE HEART BAY AREA. AND FOR MANY MANY YEARS THE CALIFORNICUM. AND BLOWN OFF THE DESIRE OF THE LOCAL COMMUNITY TEND TO GUN SHOWS BUT THAT'S JUST THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG. CALIPARI SITS ON SIXTY ACRES OF LAND. HI RIGHT IN THE HEART OF THE BAY AREA WHEN YOU ADD THE SURROUNDING PARCELS IT'S OVER EIGHTY ACRES OF LAND -- IN A REGION THAT HAS A TERRIBLE HOUSING CRISIS FOR MANY MANY YEARS. DALY CITY HAS BEEN ASKING THE CALIPARI'S WORK COLLABORATIVELY TO MAKE BETTER USE OF THE LAB. WHICH COULD INCLUDE KEEPING THE CAL PALACE AND REDEVELOPING OTHER PARTS OF THIS OF THE LARGEST PARKING LOT OF EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE -- TO ADD HOUSING AND A MIXED USE NEIGHBORHOOD FOR A PART OF DALY CITY THE DOESN'T EVEN HAVE A GROCERY STORE -- AND FOR YEARS AND YEARS THE CALIPARI BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAVE BLOWN OFF ONCE AGAIN THE LOCAL COMMUNITY AND NOTHING HAS HAPPENED -- AND SO WHAT THIS BILL WILL DO IS WITH THE AMENDMENTS IT WILL AUTHORIZE. TGS OR WILL REQUIRE THE GS TO ENTER IN THE CONVERSATIONS WITH A LOCALLY CREATED AUTHORITY COMPRISED OF DALY CITY SAN FRANCISCO AND SAN MATTEO COUNTY. AND TO ATTEMPT TO NEGOTIATE THE SALE OF THE CAL PALACE -- TO THIS LOCAL AUTHORITY -- THE BILL DOES NOT REQUIRE TGS TO CONSUMMATE THAT SALE BUT IT DOES REQUIRE THAT THERE AT LEAST BE A CONVERSATION AND THEN AUTHORIZES OUTSELL. IF TGS DETERMINES THAT IT'S IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE STATE -- TO MAKE A SALE. THE BILL ALSO PERMANENTLY BANNED A GUN SHOWS AT THE SITE WHOEVER ENDS UP. OWNING IT. ON COLLEAGUES I WISH WE DID NOT HAVE TO BE HERE -- FOR THIS BILL I WISH THAT THE CAL PALACE BOARD OF DIRECTORS -- WOULD. FOR YEARS AND YEARS I'VE WORKED WITH THE COMMUNITY -- AND UNDERSTOOD THAT EVEN THOUGH THE CAL PALACE IS TECHNICALLY A STATE. PROPERTY AND A STATE ENTITY THAT HAS A RESPONSIBILITY TO WORK COLLABORATIVELY WITH ITS NEIGHBORS IT HAS NOT DONE SO DESPITE DECADES OF REQUEST. HOW MANY SENATORS REPRESENTING DALY CITY? HAVE TO INTRODUCE LEGISLATION BEFORE THE CAL PALACE LISTENS I'M NOW THE THIRD AFTER JACKIE SPEAR AND MARK LENO. AND YET YOU THINK THEY WILL TAKE IN THE HANDS. THAT MAYBE THEY SHOULD WORK COLLABORATIVE GROUP BUT THE LOCAL COMMUNITY THEY HAVEN'T DONE SO AND SO NOW IT'S TIME TO TRY TO MOVE IN A MORE POSITIVE DIRECTION FOR OUR COMMUNITY -- SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE THOUGH -- WITH ME TODAY ARE. WE'LL DUPLICITY REPRESENTING -- DALY CITY AND KAREN LYING REPRESENTING THE CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO. CHAIRMAN SENATORS A BILL TO CLOSE THE REPRESENTING DALY CITY THE THE CAL POWER IS DOMINATED AREA OF DALY CITY CALLED THE BAY SHORE NEIGHBORHOOD. IT IS BECOME -- SOMETHING THAT NONE OF YOU WOULD WANT IN YOUR DISTRICTS AND I WOULD ASK THAT YOU WOULD THE SUPPORT CENTER WINNERS -- LEGISLATION WHICH HOPEFULLY WILL ALLOW THE LOCAL OF THE LOCALLY ELECTED OFFICIALS IN THE TWO COUNTIES IN SAID PRINCIPALLY THE CITY OF DALY CITY. TO BE ABLE TO SERVE THEIR RESIDENTS AS THEY SHOULD THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I CHARACTERS RETURN MEMBERS CAROLING ON BEHALF OF MARYLAND AND BREED AND THE CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO IN SUPPORT OF THE MEASURE TODAY THE BILL SAYS FORD AWAY FOR IT THAT -- THE CAPITALIST TO BE MORE RESPONSIVE TO LOCAL INPUT AND LOCAL CONCERNS THEIR ENJOYS THE SUPPORT AS A SICK AS A SENATOR SIDE OF ALL OF THE LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIALS AND THE COMMUNITY WE ASK FOR EITHER TODAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU OTHERS IN SUPPORT. AUDREY RETIRED CHECK FROM CRUISE STRATEGIES ON BEHALF OF SAN MATEO COUNTY -- SUPERVISOR CAN'T UP AS IN SUPPORT IN THE SAN MATTEO BOARD IS PICKING IT UP TODAY SO WE SHOULD HAVE A POSITION SHORTLY. WHAT JOHNSON HERE MATH TEACHERS FEW ALTAMONT YOUR CHILD SUPPORT -- ANYBODY IN OPPOSITION IN A PLEASE GIVE A SHORT OKAY -- I'D LIKE TO GIVE EQUAL TIME TO USE SO LET'S MAKE SURE THAT THAT WE DID HAVE A LONG PRESENTATION THERE. SO -- PLEASE -- BE EXPEDITIOUS IN YOUR COMMENTS IF YOU CAN. GO AHEAD THANK YOU -- MISTER CHAIRMAN AND DISTINGUISHED MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. YOU'VE HEARD THE MYTHS. AND LET ME DISCUSS THE MATS THE FIRST ONE IS IT'S NOT CONTROVERSIAL IT'S CONTROVERSIAL. YOU'RE TAKING STATE PROPERTY ONE OF FIFTY FOUR AGRICULTURAL DISTRICTS. WITH ANOTHER TWENTY THREE OR SO FAIRS AND EXPOSITIONS. AND YOU ARE TRANSFERRING AT TO A GROUP OF ENTITIES ONE OF WHICH DALY CITY. IS NEARLY INSOLVENT. AND EVERYBODY IN THE TWENTY CITIES OF SAN MTTEO COUNTY KNOWS THE FINANCIAL CONDITION. OF DALY CITY. IF THE AREA IS DEPRESSED. WHO'S RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT. DALY CITY IS THE AREA. THE AUTHOR TALKS ABOUT THERE'S NO GROCERY STORE. I HAPPEN TO A BAND Là LAWYER FOR THE GROCERY STORE YEARS AGO. BEFORE THE AUTHOR EVER KNOW -- THERE WAS A JOURNEY BUT I HAVE IN YOU BOB LONG. AND HE HAD TO GO OUT OF BUSINESS BECAUSE HE WASN'T PROTECTED BY DALY CITY. ONE OF THE OTHER MATHS. IS THAT THE LOCAL COMMUNITY -- IS NOT USING. THE CAL BALANCES THOUGH THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS IS SOME MARROW IN AND HAAS STYLE CONDITION TORE. LOCAL COMMUNITY 95% OF WAGES IN DALY CITY IN OF A COUPLE OF ACRES AND NOW SAN FRANCISCO USES FOR POLICE DEPARTMENT TRAINING FOR FIRE DEPARTMENT TRAINING. FIRST WHAT TEAM SO C. H. B. USES AT THE SAN FRANCISCO POLICE DEPARTMENT USES IT FOR TRAINING. EIGHT NINE TEN YEARS AGO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA STOP PUTTING UP ANY MONEY FOR AGRICULTURAL DISTRICTS THIS IS JUST FOR GOURMET. IT STARTED AS DISTRICT. ONE EIGHTY AND IN THE LAST EIGHT OR NINE YEARS THE COW PALACE HAS HOSTED EVENTS ALL THE WAY FROM. CONCERTS OF COURSE THE FAMOUS GRAND NATIONAL. HORSE BOX. AND CATTLE -- SHOW -- THE ALL OF THE GUN AT THE FLOWER SHOWS THE REPTILE. REPTILE SHOW A COUPLE WEEKS AGO I SAY WE ENDED BURKE LAY PERHAPS BUT I FIRST CAME TO THE COW PALACE IN. NINETEEN FIFTY FIVE AS A VETERAN OF THE KOREAN WAR IT'S GOT A HISTORY WHICH IS ON MATCH. ALBEIT IN ANOTHER DISTRICTS AND ANY OTHER AG DISTRICT ON THE STATE YOU LOOK AT THE SENATE LOUNGE AND YOU SEE ALL THOSE POSTERS. FOR THE FAIRS FOR THE EXPOSITION'S. WHICH ONE WILL BE THE NEXT ONE TO GO IF THIS LAND GRAB AND THAT IS NOT A FAST SOLD TERM. A LAND GRAB IS ALLOWED. THIS BILL IN ITS PRESENT CONDITION I WANT TO COMPLIMENT MISTER CHAIRMAN THE ANALYST OF THIS BILL. WASN'T EVEN LEGAL IT VIOLATED THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA A GIVEAWAY. WITHOUT. PAYING MARKET VALUE AND I WANNA SEE THAT IF IT EVER HAPPENED DALY CITY CONTRIBUTE TO A PAYING MARKET. VALUE. THIS BILL IS BASICALLY A GUN SHOW BILL. THE THE MOTIVATION TO SHUT DOWN THE GUN SHOW. THE GUN SHOW PEOPLE WILL TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES -- USE OF SUSPECTED FURTHER -- TESTIMONY YOU WANNA SHOT THE GUN SHOW DOWN. THERE AND HAVE AN HONEST BAIL AND NON BILL. BUT DON'T ENGAGE IN A LAND GRAB WHICH CHEATS. THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA EXCEPT FOR THOSE WHO LIVE IN DALY CITY AND THE COUNTY OF SAN MATTEO AND OF SAN FRANCISCO -- WOULD OF A U. S. AT WHICH HAS BEEN A PART OF THOSE STATE SENT TO BE GAGGED CONSTRUCTION UNDER THE WORKS PROGRESS ADMINISTRATION. IN NINETEEN THIRTY SIX AND WAS DEDICATED IN. NINETEEN FORTY ONE TAKE ALL OF THE BILL EXCEPT THE GUN SHOW PART. WHICH WAS VETOED LAST YEAR ON A PERCIPIENT MESSAGE BY THE HONORABLE EDMUND G. BROWN. JUNIOR TAKE IT ALL OUT. DEAL WITH THE GUN SHOW AS YOU WELL THE GUN SHOW IS GOING TO BE. HISTORY ON ITS OWN WITH A RECOMMENDATION FROM COW PALACE STAB AT THE APRIL MEETING OF THE BOARD OF THANK YOU FOR THE TIME MISTER CHAIRMAN. NEXT WITNESS MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE LOUIS BROWN ON BEHALF OF WESTERN FAIRS ASSOCIATION I LIKE TO MAKE USE THREE QUICK POINTS MISTER CHAIRMAN. FIRST TRUE WHAT SENATOR COP MENTIONED THIS IS THE AGENDA FOR THE NEXT CAL PALACE MEETING IT HAS BEEN THE GEN DIS AS AN ACTION ITEM FOR THE APPROVAL OF A STATEMENT OF POLICY TO DISCONTINUE ALL FUTURE GUN SHOWS AT THE COW PALACE. BEGINNING JANUARY. ONE TWENTY TWENTY THE DATE IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE THAT IS WHEN THE CONTRACT RUNS OUT FOR THE CURRENT SITUATION HAD THEY ACTED ON THIS ANY SOONER. THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN IN BREACH OF CONTRACT AND THAT WOULD HAVE CREATED ANOTHER LEGAL ISSUE I THAT WE NOW SEE HAPPENING AT ANOTHER DISTRICT ASSOCIATION. AMENDMENT THREE THIS NOT BEEN ACCEPTED -- IS ACTUALLY VERY CRITICAL TO EVERY MEMBER OF THIS COMMITTEE THAT HAS A DISTRICT ASSOCIATION IN ITS PROPERTY CURRENT FOOD NAG CODE STATES THAT IF DISTRICT AGOSTO SOLUTION PROPERTY IS SOLD. IT IS TO BE IN PUT IN THE DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AGRICULTURE HELD IN TRUST FOR THAT DISTRICT AGOSTO SOLUTION. FOR THE PURPOSES OF RELOCATING THAT PROPERTY THAT FAIR IF WITHIN THREE YEARS THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN. THIS THE REVENUES FROM THAT SALE DINNER DISTRIBUTED TO THE REST OF THE NETWORK OF CALIFORNIA FAIRS. THAT WAS DONE SO THAT ONE FAIRS COULD PLAN AND MOVE AS COMMUNITIES GROW AND CHANGE BUT ALSO. RECOGNIZING THAT IT'S A NETWORK OF CALIFORNIA FAIRS AND SO IF ONE IS GOING TO BE SOLD AND NOT RE INVESTED THAT IS TO THE TO BE TO THE BENEFIT OF ALL THE REST OF THE DISTRICT AGOSTO SEE ASIANS. WHO HAVE SERIOUS NEEDS -- AND IF YOU'VE BEEN ON ANY OF THOSE FAIRGROUND PROPERTY YOU WOULD KNOW THEY HAVE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE NEEDS AT A SIGNIFICANT LEVEL SO WITHOUT THE ACCEPTANCE OF THAT AMENDMENT NUMBER. THREE AT LEAST A CROSS REFERENCE TO EXISTING LAW EVERY DISTRICT AGOSTO SOLUTION IN THE STATE AND COUNTY FAIR FACES SOME JEOPARDY FROM THIS DISTRICT BILL FINALLY. THERE IS LOCAL CONTROL ON THIS BOARD IT HAS AN APPOINT A BOOK APPOINTED BOARD OF NINE MEMBERS THE FOOD NAG CODE SEC. THE FOOD AYE CODE STATES THAT WHEN A DISTRICT AGOSTO SITUATION OVERLAPS TWO COUNTIES THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE REPRESENTATION FROM BOTH COUNTIES. IT EXISTS RIGHT NOW NINE MEMBERS OF THE BOARD SOME FROM SAN MATTEO COUNTY SOME FROM THE CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN RANCISCO. BY JANUARY THE END OF JANUARY NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY GOVERNOR GAVIN NEWSOM WILL HAVE A MAJORITY OF THE APPOINTED BOARD MEMBERS. ON THIS BOARD. EVERYTHING THAT THIS. NOW SEEKS TO DO THE TRANSFER PROPERTY THE LEASING OF PROPERTY WHICH HAS BEEN NEGOTIATED FOR YEARS CAN HAPPEN UNDER THE CURRENT AUTHORITY THE CURRENT -- POWERS INVESTED OR VESTED IN THE DISTRICT AGOSTO SOLUTION SO THESE GOALS CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED THE COMMUNITY GOALS CAN BE REACHED GOVERNOR NEW SOME WILL HAVE CONTROL OVER THE BOARD COME NEXT YEAR. ALL OF THIS CAN BE RESOLVED WITHOUT A BILL LADIES AND GENTLEMEN PLEASE VOTE NO. TIME LIMIT YOU GUYS HAVE COME ALL THE WAY HERE SO PLEASE -- PERCY BUT I'D LIKE YOU TO KEEP IT SHORT IF YOU CAN THANK THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I WILL KEEP IT TO A MINUTE NOW THANK. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS KEVIN PATTERSON I AM EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE SAVE THE COW PALACE COALITION AND PRODUCER OF THE DICKENS CHRISTMAS OR AT THE COW PALACE. I'M HERE TODAY REPRESENTING THE MANY EVENT PRODUCERS AREA BUSINESSES AND THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF ANNUAL VISITORS WHO BELIEVE IN A BRIGHT FUTURE FOR THE CAPITALIST. I CAN SAY WITH PROFESSIONAL CERTAINTY BUT THE COW PALACE IS A VITAL AND VIABLE EVENT FACILITY WHEN EVENTS LIKE THE GRAND NATIONAL RODEO THE DICKENS CHRISTMAS FAIR THE GOLDEN GATE DOG SHOW AND MANY OTHERS. AND THE HUGE AUDIENCES THAT ATTEND THEM AND ARRIVE AT THE COW PALACE THEY RECEIVE ALL THE PRESENT DAY. NATIONAL EVENTS SERVICES THEY REQUIRE FIXING THE ROOMS WOULD BE GREAT AND THE COW PALACE IS BUILDING A FUND ITSELF TO DO THIS BUT IT IS COMPLETELY FUNCTIONAL ALREADY. AS WELL AS BEING A UNIQUE AND IRREPLACEABLE FACILITY. THAT CAN BE EFFICIENTLY UPGRADED AT A FRACTION OF THE COST OF BUILDING ANYTHING NEW ANYWHERE IN CALIFORNIA. I RESPECT THAT SENATOR WIENER AND HIS CO AUTHORS HAVE AN INTEREST IN MORE COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT BUT THE COW PALACE ALREADY SERVES A BROAD CROSS SECTION OF THE COMMUNITY REPRESENTED HERE BY OUR% COALITION AND MANY OTHERS. WE FEEL STRONGLY THAT THE COW PALACE SHOULD REMAIN WITHIN THE STATE FAIRGROUNDS SYSTEM. THE KALPOE AS GOVERNING BOARD WILL BE GETTING NEW LOCAL AREA MEMBERS APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR MYSELF AND OTHER EVENT PRODUCERS PLEDGE TO WORK WITH HIS NEWLY ENERGIZED BOARD. TO PRODUCE EXCITING NEW EVENTS AND EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS FOR LOCAL USE THAT ENGAGE THE COMMUNITY MORE THAN EVER. AND HOUSING IS MENTIONED BY MISTER BROWN IS ALREADY HAPPENING ON ONE THIRD OF THE AVAILABLE ACREAGE WE ASK THAT THE COMMITTEE. OPPOSE THIS BILL AS WRITTEN THANK YOU.

I WASN'T PLANNING TO SPEAK BUT MY NAME IS MARK COP AND I'M PRESIDENT OF THE COW PALACE BOARD OF DIRECTORS. IT IS REALLY SAD THAT THE GOOD BOARD. THAT HAS WORKED SO HARD AT THE COW PALACE HAS BEEN GIVEN THE WRONG IMPRESSION TO ALL OF YOU I HAVE BEEN ON THE BOARD FOR FIFTEEN YEARS. WE HAVE NO. WE HAVE NO DEBTS BECAUSE OF US WE HAVE SURPLUSES THAT WE'RE TRYING TO WORK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION TO FIX OUR ROADS WE HAVE AN EXCELLENT BOARD WE WORK WITH THE COMMUNITY WE DO A LOT OF THINGS FREE. IF YOU WANT THE PUBLIC TO PARTICIPATE IN HONEST GOOD FAITH WORK. WE ARE ONE OF THE GROUPS AND I RESENT SENATOR WIENERS. URGING A BUS I HAD TO GET UP TO TELL YOU HE THANK YOU. WE'RE GOING TO TURN TO THE BOARD -- THE LORD. AND THE COMMITTEE WHAT ARE WAITING. SENATOR NIELSEN MISTER CHAIRMAN I'M GOING TO HAVE TO RAISE THE ISSUE HERE FOR THE RECORD OF GERMANUS. I'M KIND OF FUSSY ABOUT THE RULES HERE AND THIS IS. JERMAINE THIS IS OFTEN FOUND IT BECOMES A PRACTICE BUT THIS IS A VERY BLATANT EXAMPLE OF GERMANUS AND I'LL RAISE IT AGAIN ON THE FLOOR. I'M GOING TO INQUIRE OF LEAD COUNSEL FOR THEIR OPINION ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THIS IS JERMAINE. BUT I ALSO WANT TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THE AGRICULTURAL DISTRICTS YOU KNOW THEY'RE ALL OVER THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THEIR HISTORIC AN ABSOLUTELY INGRAINED IN THE HISTORY OF THE STATE. AND THIS NOW TAPPERS WITH THAT. THE SACRED POSITION THAT THESE TAG OF CULTURAL DISTRICTS HOLD. IN ALL OF OUR DISTRICT ALMOST AND THIS IS NOT SOMETHING TO BE TRIFLED WITH IN MY OPINION. IT ALSO. IS FOUNDING PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA Y. SPEC PRIVATE PROPERTY AND KIND OF SENSITIVE ABOUT EMINENT DOMAIN. AND TO ME THIS IS EMINENT DOMAIN BY ANOTHER MEANS SO [inaudible] EXCUSE ME. HILL THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR IN THE THANK YOU TO SENATOR COP FOR BEING HERE TODAY AND I IN CONVERSING WITH HIM I UNDERSTAND AND AND AND MRS COP THAT THE THE THE FAIR. THE CAL POWERS BORDER THEY HAVE ABOUT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IN THE IN THE BANK -- TO DO THE REPAIRS THAT ARE NECESSARY AND AND I GUESS I'M A IS A SENATOR WIENER MENTIONED A CO AUTHOR OF THE LETTER. THE LEGISLATION AND I'VE GREW UP AROUND THE COW PALACE IN THE SINCE IT'S ABOUT SIX YEARS OLDER THAN I AM -- AND SINCE I'M I WILL BE RETIRING IN A YEAR AND A HALF OR TWO YEARS FROM THE THIS IT MAY BE TIME TO RETIRE THE CALCULUS AS WELL BUT IT IN SAYING THAT IT. TO ME THE ENVIRONMENT THAT HAS BEEN CRAFTED IN CREATED AROUND THE CAL POLISH IS THE CHALLENGE AND THAT'S HISTORICALLY -- HAS BEEN. SOMETHING THAT HAS NOT FIT INTO THAT COMMUNITY WHEN IT WAS CONSTRUCTED IN NINETEEN FORTY ONE I'M SURE IT DID IT FIT. INTO OPEN A NEW COMMUNITY THAT WAS GROWING IN TRYING -- TO TO DEVELOP BUT WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT THE COMMUNITIES OF STRUGGLE. IN THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS HAVE STRUGGLED AND HAD A VERY DIFFICULT TIME OF OF PROGRESSING TO THE POINT WHERE THEY CAN -- THEY CAN SUCCEED. IN THE CRIME ESPECIALLY IN THE SAN FRANCISCO SIDE IN NOW IN THE DALY CITY SIDE -- HAS BEEN CHALLENGING I THINK AS THIS BILL. AND I APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENTS. I THINK THAT WILL TAKE IT IN A DIRECTION THAT -- THAT I DIDN'T FOR COMFORTABLE WITH. BECAUSE WHAT IT DOES IS ALLOW FOR THAT CONVERSATION TO MOVE FORWARD. AS TO WHAT THE COW PALACE YOU SHOULD BE TO THAT COMMUNITY WHAT IT SHOULD LOOK LIKE FOR THAT COMMUNITY. AND WHAT IT COULD. WHAT WHAT IT COULD GROW INTO I DON'T THINK ANYONE WANTS TO DISCOURAGE OR ELIMINATE -- SOME OF THE ACTIVITIES THAT ARE OCCURRING AT THE AT THE COW PALACE BUT THERE MAY BE A WAY OF DOING THAT. IN A WAY OF ALSO ALLOWING FOR OTHER TYPES OF DEVELOPMENT AND GROWTH WITHIN THAT COMMUNITY. IF IT'S HOUSING OR IF IT'SSOME OTHER AMENITIES THAT ARE NECESSARY FOR STRUGGLE UP FOR WHAT IS A STRUGGLING COMMUNITY INTO A THRIVING COMMUNITY. SO I I THINK THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO TAKE THAT NEXT STEP HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS AND PERHAPS I MEAN THE ONE THING ABOUT THE CAL POLICIES IS NOT THE MOST ATTRACTIVE BUILDING. AT EIGHT ANYONE HAS EVER SEEN I MEAN IT IS IT IS AN EYESORE IN THE COMMUNITY -- AND PERHAPS THAT CAN BE RE DONE IN A WAY -- THAT COULD DEVELOP THE COMMUNITY AND STRENGTH IN THAT COMMUNITY SO I'LL BE -- THE SUPPORTING THE BILL AND APPRECIATED MOVING FORWARD AND HAVING THOSE CONVERSATIONS THAT I THINK A CRUCIAL. TO THE FUTURE OF DALY CITY AND IN THE FUTURE OF THAT SOUTHERN AREA OF SAN FRANCISCO. THANK YOU ANYBODY ELSE WISHING TO ADDRESS [inaudible] IT. YEAH WE HAVE -- GO AHEAD SIR HUESO. WERE YOU CAN SAY WELL WE HAVE A MEMBER THE NEEDS TO LEAVE SO WE'RE JUST. GO AHEAD PROCEED. YES GENERALLY YOU KNOW THIS IS A REALLY TOUGH ISSUE FOR ME BECAUSE I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF LOCAL ELECTED SINNERS STRUGGLES WITH THE COMMUNITY AND AND THERE ARE SO THERE SEEM TO BE UNFORTUNATELY SOME CONFLICTS BETWEEN THE OF THE COMMUNITY STATE FAIR AND DOES DOES I THINK NEED. TO BE CORRECTED DAYS THEY NEED TO BE ROUTED OUT. BUT I DON'T THINK WE NEED THIS BILL TO DO THAT I THINK THE LAW ALREADY ESTABLISHES FOR THE RELOCATION OF FAIR. POSES A HARM OR THREAT TO THE COMMUNITY AND MY HOPE. IS NOT THAT WE JUST -- UNDUE AFFAIR BUT IF IF IT NEEDS TO BE RE RE LOCATED OF IT HE LOOKED THE FAIR WAS OUR FIRST THE COMMUNITY. DEVELOPED AROUND IF THEY DID FIND A WAY TO PLAN ACCORDINGLY. THAT THAT'S A THAT'S A FAILURE ON ON THE LOCAL CITIES THEY THEY SHOULD HAVE PLANNED A AROUND THAT. THE DEVELOPMENT AROUND THE FIRST HAVE PLANNED ACCORDING. TO A A RESOURCE THAT'S ALREADY THERE AND IF THEY DIDN'T DO THAT WELL THAT'S SOMETHING THEY HAVE TO DEAL WITH. BUT IF THE ONLY WAY TO DEAL WITH THAT IS -- TO TO CLOSE ON THIS FOR I HOPE THEY IT'S READ LOCATED. AND I HOPE THERE'S A REAP A PROCESS TO RELOCATE WITHIN THAT COMMUNITY BECAUSE IT WOULD BE SHAME TO LOSE. ON IN A RESOURCE LIKE THIS FROM MY PERSPECTIVE THE WAY I LOOK AT IT I HAVE WORKED VERY CLOSELY WITH OUR OUR STATE FOR SAN DIEGO AND IMPERIAL AND IN SACRAMENTO I HAVE -- SUPPORTED EVENTS IN SACRAMENTO AND I'VE GOTTEN THEM TO DO THINGS. THAT I THINK ARE JUST MARVELOUS -- FOR THE PEOPLE OF OUR STATE I WOULD HATE TO DEPRIVE THE PEOPLE OF OUR STATE OF THAT RESOURCE. SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT HAPPENS AT THESE FAIRS. ESPECIALLY TO THE BACKBONE WHICH ARE A LOT OF THE BUSINESSES THAT TRY FROM THERE NOT ONLY. THE TWO THEY GO TO THEIR FOR BUT THEY ALSO SERVE MY FARED SAN DIEGO AND IMPERIAL AND SACRAMENTO SO -- THIS IS REALLY TOUGH ONE OUT ON THE LAY OFF THE BILL BECAUSE I THINK. THIS THE ADMINISTRATION OF THIS FAIRS FIRMLY WITHIN OUR GRASP WITHIN THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE WHO WE APPOINT THERE. ARE WE SUPPORTING THE FARES THE OTHER QUESTION I THINK WE SHOULD SUPPORT THESE FARES -- WILL GIVE THEM MORE RESOURCES I WOULD SUPPORT THAT -- I HAVE WORK TO RAISE MONEY FOR THE FAIRS. AND CREATE PROGRAM MEAN AND IF YOU'LL GIVE THEM BETTER OPTIONS I KNOW THEY WILL EXERCISE AND THEY'LL BRING TO YOUR COMMUNITY THINGS THAT ARE BETTER FOR THE COMMUNITY OF COURSE THEY WILL. IT'S ALL INCUMBENT ON ON ON THE MEMBERS THAT WE APPOINT TO THE BOARD AND IT LOOKS LIKE. THEY NEED OUR HELP AND I THINK THAT'S IT SHOULD BE THE APPROACH OF TAKES CENTER WAY THANK YOU. WE HAVE A MOTION FROM CENTER HILL THAT ARE GALGIANI. I HAVE A QUESTION. QUESTION. UNDER THIS BILL UNDER THIS FRAMEWORK WOULD ALLOW FOR D. G. S. AND THE CURRENT BOARD WHOM EVER TO BE ABLE. TO COME UP WITH THE WAY THAT THE COW PALACE COULD USE A SECTION OF THE PROPERTY AND THEN. OTHER SECTIONS OF THE PROPERTY BE USED FOR A HIGHER USE THAT THE COMMUNITY WOULD GET BEHIND. YES I SENATOR THIS BILL WITH THE AMENDMENTS THANK YOU AGAIN THE CHAIR AND HIS COMMITTEE. GIVES COMPLETE FLEXIBILITY TGS COULD DECIDE WE'RE NOT SELLING ANYTHING AND WE'RE KEEPING THE STATUS QUO OR WE'RE GOING TO SELL A PORTION OF THE LAND WAR WHICH IS GOING TO CHANGE HOW WE MANAGE. THE LAND AND KEEP THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS THE COMPLETE ALL THIS DOES IS AUTHORIZED AND REQUIRED DISCUSSION BUT IT DOESN'T REQUIRE ANY PARTICULAR RESULT. DUNCAN IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT THIS BILL DOES NOT IN ANY WAY DICTATE THE REMOVAL OF THE CAL PALACE THIS BILL SAYS NOTHING ABOUT WHETHER THE CAL PALACE. IS REMOVED OUT WILL BE A DECISION A TGS CAN MAKE OR THE LOCAL COMMUNITY CAN MAKE UP IT SOLD. I I HAVE A FURTHER QUESTION A FOLLOW UP QUESTION TO THAT I DON'T LIKE GIVING THAT MUCH AUTHORITY FROM THE LEGISLATURE AINGE'S DELEGATING THAT TO D. G. S. I HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THAT AND I HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT WHAT THIS BILL. IF PASSED -- THE STAGE THAT IT SETS FOR SOMETHING ELSE MAYBE NEXT TIME IT'S MY FAIR AND ONE OF MY DISTRICTS -- SO WOULD YOU CONSIDER AN AMENDMENT TO IT IF THIS BILL MOVES TO THAT POINT AND D. G. S. THEN HAS THE ABILITY TO LOOK AT THIS MAKE THIS DECISION. WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO TAKE AN AMENDMENT THAT REQUIRES THAT NOTHING CAN BE SOLD UNLESS THE LEGISLATURE AT A LATER TIME THEN IT PROVES THAT SALE WHETHER THAT'S LANGUAGE TAKEN IN A FUTURE BUDGET FOR WHETHER IT'S A SEPARATE BILL DOWN THE ROAD. I'D BE OPEN TO THAT CONVERSATION CENTER I'M NOT I CAN'T AGREED ABOUT YOU KNOW ON THE FLY. TODAY ABOUT THIS BILL IS A WORK IN PROGRESS WE KNOW THAT AND IT SPARKED A CONVERSATION. AND AND THAT'S WHY IT'S IMPORTANT FOR IT TO MOVE FORWARD. WITHOUT THIS BILL THAT NOW THEY'RE CANCELING THE GUN SHOWS. WHAT IT TOOK THAT BECAUSE OF THIS BILL? FINALLY THERE LISTENING AND SO THAT'S WHY WE WANT THIS BILL TO MOVE FORWARD AND HE'S. LEAVING [inaudible] FOR PLEASE CENTER GLAZER [inaudible] YEAH. JUST AYE I DIDN'T HEAR THE BEGINNING OF THE CENTERS PRESENTATION DID HE ACCEPT ALL THE AMENDMENT THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS INCLUDING THEM IN. THREE IT DID NOT ALL BUT TWO AND THREE ALL RIGHT. WELL FOR MEI MEAN IN SOME WAYS THIS IS A DISTRICT ISSUE AND RESPECT THE REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE AREA -- AND THEIR SENSITIVITY TO THEIR OWN COMMUNITY. ON THE OTHER HAND I DO THINK THAT WE DO HAVE SOME STATE RESPONSIBILITY HERE IN THIS MATTER I DO. AGREE WITH SENATOR GALGIANI IS -- AMENDMENT THAT -- IT WE SHOULD HAVE SOME BECAUSE SOME IT -- ENGAGEMENT ON THIS IT SHOULD BE A COMPLETE APPLICATION -- TO D. G. S. SO I I'M WILLING TO MOVE THE BILL FOR TODAY ALTHOUGH THESE QUESTIONS REMAIN AND I HOPE THAT WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR -- WE CAN CLEAR THEM UP BEFORE I THE MATTER GETS THE FLOOR SO THAT THAT'S THAT'S MY FEELING -- NINE FORGIVE ME ALL I WAS ALSO ON LATER THIS SO WAS THIS ISSUE DISCUSSED IN OF SOCIAL WHICH GIVE ME A SHORT ANSWER. WAS THIS EVER LOOKED UPON BY -- BY COUNSEL AS WHETHER THIS WOULD BE A GIFT OF PUBLIC FUNDS BOB. I'M NOT SURE IT HAS BEEN WITH THE AMENDMENTS THAT HE'S ACCEPTED THAT I ASKED NEW EXCEPT IT'S NOT DOING THAT ANYMORE. BUT IS INSTEAD OF TO TRY TO CAUSE A MEMBER LEFT BUT NO IT'S NOT THIS ALL IS SIMPLY. A IT AUTHORIZES THE SALE. PURSUANT TO A NEGOTIATION. FOR WORK OR DIGEST COULD DECIDE NOT TO SELL. THE ALL IT DOES SO THAT'S THAT'S WHAT THE AMENDMENT IS THE BILL. TO SIMPLY AUTHORIZES THE SALE. OR NOT WHAT AUTHORIZES THE AND THEY CAN DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT TO SELL. AT MARKET RATE. OUR OUR YES. THE MEMBER EVEN GOES FURTHER IN THE BEST IF IF THEY DETERMINE ITS THE BEST INTEREST OF THE STATE PEOPLE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ANY OTHER MEMBERS WISH TO COMMENT -- I I YOU KNOW JUST FOR THE PUBLIC EVERYTHING -- THE SENATOR CAME TO MY OFFICE. I WAS OPPOSED TO THIS BILL AND BASICALY THE REASON WHY I WAS OPPOSED TO THE BILL WAS IT WAS A GIFT IN MY VIEW THE WAY THE BILL WAS PRESENTED. HE TOOK WE PRESENTED THEM IT'S TO A AND THE ONCE THE CONCERNED ME THE MOST HE ACCEPTED -- THE OTHER AMENDMENTS THAT HE IS NOT ACCEPTED WILL BE ADDRESSED IN PUBLIC SAFETY I THINK THAT'S APPROPRIATE. EXCUSE AT THOSE PUBLIC SAFETY WAS GOING TO NEXT. IT IS REPORTED STRIPPERS FOR IT YET. SO SO AT ANY RATE -- THAT'S WHY -- YOU KNOW. THAT'S WHY I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY. SO WITH THAT CALL THE ROLL PLEASE. FILE ITEM WHAT SORRY WE HAVE DOCTOR -- WANTED TO BUT WAS VERY BRIEFLY WHEN I WITH RESPECT TO CENTER GLAZERS COMING WITH THE OTHER TWO AMENDMENTS I ACTUALLY DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM. WITH THOSE AMENDMENTS AT ALL BUT IF IT WERE TALKING ABOUT PROBABLY A SIGNIFICANT SUM OF MONEY -- AND I TO ME IT IT DOESN'T MATTER FOR PREPAY. INTO THE GENERAL FUND OR STAYS WITH THE FAIRS BUT THAT'S A DECISION THAT I THINK. NEEDS TO BE. FIVE FIVE MADE AND I DON'T I DON'T CARE WHICH WAY THAT THAT FALLS BUT I THINK THAT THAT DOESN'T BILLION A BIGGER ISSUE BECAUSE IT WILL BE ABLE. TO TOUCH A LARGE SUM OF MONEY AND IN TERMS OF THE REIMBURSEMENT OF THE OF THESE YES FOR ANY EXPENSES -- I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH THAT EITHER -- ANY DEAL WILL INCORPORATE THAT BUT IF THAT GOES INTO THE BILL I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT BUT WE HAD DECIDED THAT WE WOULD TAKE THOSE BOTH UP AND APPROPRIATIONS INSTEAD OF HERE. BUT I'M NOT OBJECTING TO EITHER -- ONE AND THEN I JUST TO BE A FEW THINGS THAT WERE SAID -- TO CENTER HUESO THE FAIR WAS YOUR FIRST KNOW THE PAIR WASN'T HERE FIRST THE DALY CITY WAS THERE. FIRST AND SO THIS IS AN ISSUE THEY HAVE STRUGGLED WITH FOR A LONG TIME -- THESE LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIALS AND LEADERS SUPPORT THIS BILL THEY KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON AROUND THERE -- AND THEY'RE ASKING US. TO DO THIS AND THEY'RE ASKING US FOR MORE OF A SAY IN WHAT HAPPENS -- AT THE COW PALACE -- YOU KNOW AS I JUST MENTIONED -- THE FACT THAT AFTER ALL THESE DECADES THEY REFUSE TO GET RID OF HIS GUN SHOWS BUT EVERYONE MONEY ARE GONE -- AND EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED IN THIS LEGISLATURE AND THEY JUST IGNORED IT. BIG NOR IT AND NOW THEY'RE CLAIMING -- WE'RE GETTING RID OF THE GUN SHOWS BECAUSE OF THIS BILL AND SOMETIMES IT'S ASKING FOR THIS BILL TO MOVE FORWARD SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE. OUR CONVERSATION I RESPECTFULLY ASK. FOR AND SHE JUST FOR THE JUST FOR THE RECORD HERE THIS IS GOING TO PUBLIC SAFETY NEXT I DO NOT THINK THAT THE DOES TO AMENDMENTS REQUIRE THE AUTHORITY REIMBURSE. TGS FOR ANY COST OR EXPENSE INCURRED IN THE DISPOSITION. IN A MEMBER THREE REQUIRE THE NET PROCEEDS OF AN ANYBODY -- THE THE GO TO THE THE FEAR AN EXPOSITION FINDER THE GENERAL FUND -- THOSE WILL BE HANDLED IN APPROPRIATIONS -- SO I JUST I I JUST I SAID SOMETHING EARLIER THAT MAY HAVE MADE SOMEBODY BELIEVE THAT THOSE WERE GOING TO NECESSARILY BE HEARD IN THE NEXT COMMITTEE. THEY WILL MOST DEFINITELY BE HEARD [inaudible] SORRY [inaudible] WHAT OKAY? WHEN YOU'RE DONE IF I GET? PLEASE SET FORTINO AND AS FAR AS I I KNOW THE PEOPLE KEEP TALKING ABOUT THINGS BEING HANDLED AND APPROPRIATIONS I'VE BEEN COMMITTED. ANYTHING. THE SERVER BODY KNOWS THERE'S NO. THE PROBE THERE'S NO DEAL WITH APPROPRIATIONS YET OTHER THAN IT'S GOING TO IF IT GETS OUT OF THE NEXT COMMITTEE IT'S GOING TO COME TO APPROPRIATIONS. AND WILL FURTHER CONVERSATION BUT THERE THERE ARE NO APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN APPROVED. OR INTRODUCED TO SERVE IN THAT IF A FIVE PLY DAD I DID I DIDN'T MEAN TO IMPLY THAT BASICALLY WHATEVER AMENDMENTS. ARE GOING TO BE THE IF IF THOSE AMENDMENTS ARE GONNA BE HEARD THEY'RE GOING TO BE HEARD IN APPROPRIATIONS. THERE ARE ENOUGH. RECORDS CLICK HERE [inaudible] CRYSTAL RIGHT.
