ELIGIBILITY RULES FOR THE LONG

00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:30.341

ANY OTHER PAYER I IN THE MARKET

00:33:42.620 --> 00:33:44.255
BUT IN ADDITION BECAUSE THE

COST LONG TERM CARE. TENDS TO

00:33:46.391 --> 00:33:47.925

THE REST OF THEIR LIVES. THE

00:33:54.232 --> 00:33:55.767
LAST CATEGORY IS A LITTLE BIT

00:33:55.833 --> 00:33:57.335
DIFFERENT THE MEDICARE SAVINGS

00:33:57.402 --> 00:33:59.504
PROGRAM. THE M. S. P. ARE

00:33:59.570 --> 00:34:00.638
FEDERALLY FUNDED PROGRAMS

PREMIUMS DEDUCTIBLES AND

00:34:09.013 --> 00:34:10.148
COINSURANCE AND SO THAT'S A

00:34:10.214 --> 00:34:12.150
LITTLE BIT OF A UNIQUE PROGRAM

00:34:12.216 --> 00:34:14.085

A PULMONARY POINTS- CALIFORNIA

00:34:24.362 --> 00:34:25.930
HAS IMPLEMENTED SOME OF THE

00:34:25.997 --> 00:34:26.931
FLEXIBILITY TO REDUCE THE

FROM THE ASSET LIMIT AND I

00:34:35.039 --> 00:34:36.541
EXPECT THAT ONE OF THE OTHER

00:34:36.607 --> 00:34:38.075
SPEAKERS TODAY WILL BE ABLE TO

00:34:38.142 --> 00:34:40.211

DISABILITY CATEGORIES ARE

00:34:45.349 --> 00:34:46.117
SUBJECT TO DIFFERENT RESOURCE

00:34:46.184 --> 00:34:50.455
LIMITS. SO FOR THE- SSID LINKS

00:34:50.521 --> 00:34:52.824
THAT FOR ALL OF THOSE PROGRAMS

00:34:52.890 --> 00:34:55.259
THE RESOURCE WOMAN IS BASED ON

00:34:55.326 --> 00:34:56.561
THE BILL AT THE RESOURCE LIMIT

00:34:56.627 --> 00:34:57.728
THAT WOULD BE APPLIED IF YOU

00:34:57.795 --> 00:34:59.030
ARE PLAYING FOR SUPPLEMENTAL

00:34:59.096 --> 00:35:01.132
SECURITY INCOME SO IN THAT CASE

00:35:01.199 --> 00:35:03.468
WE'RE LOOKING AT TWO THOUSAND

00:35:03.534 --> 00:35:04.569

THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX.

00:35:28.459 --> 00:35:30.828
CURRENTLY THAT LIMIT WELL TO

00:35:30.895 --> 00:35:32.997
TWENTY TWENTY THAT LIMIT WAS

00:35:33.064 --> 00:35:33.564

AS CHAIR PERSON WOULD HAD

00:35:50.948 --> 00:35:52.717
MENTIONED THESE THE FOR

00:35:52.783 --> 00:35:55.386
PARTICULATE FOR THE S. SOCIETY

00:35:55.453 --> 00:35:57.788
LINKS TO A RESOURCE LIMIT THAT

00:35:57.855 --> 00:35:59.457
LIMIT HAS NOT BEEN UPDATED FOR

00:35:59.524 --> 00:36:01.826
INFLATION SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY

00:36:01.893 --> 00:36:03.694
NINE IT HAD BEEN UPDATED

00:36:03.761 --> 00:36:06.797
SOMEWHAT REGULARLY PRIOR TO

00:36:06.864 --> 00:36:07.832
NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE BUT IN

00:36:07.899 --> 00:36:08.366
NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE IT'S

00:36:08.432 --> 00:36:10.067
STARTED TO STAY FLAT SO WHAT

00:36:10.134 --> 00:36:11.102
THIS IN THIS LIGHT COMES

00:36:11.168 --> 00:36:12.403
DIRECTLY FROM THE CALIFORNIA

00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:14.005
HEALTH CARE FOUNDATION ISSUE

00:36:14.071 --> 00:36:15.873
PAPER AND WHAT IT DEMONSTRATES

00:36:15.940 --> 00:36:16.941
IS THAT EVEN IF YOU ARE

00:36:17.008 --> 00:36:19.343
APPLYING REGULAR ADJUSTMENTS

00:36:19.410 --> 00:36:21.078
BASED ON THE CPI TO THOSE

00:36:21.145 --> 00:36:23.948
LIMITS. AS OF AND THIS IS A

00:36:24.015 --> 00:36:27.118
THROUGH TWENTY NINETEEN- AS A

00:36:27.184 --> 00:36:28.185
TWENTY NINETEEN INSTEAD OF A

00:36:28.252 --> 00:36:29.353
TWO THOUSAND DOLLAR LIMIT FOR

00:36:29.420 --> 00:36:30.321
AN INDIVIDUAL YOU'D BE LOOKING

00:36:30.388 --> 00:36:33.124
AT FOUR THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED

00:36:33.190 --> 00:36:33.724
FIFTY SEVEN AND FOR A COUPLE

00:36:33.791 --> 00:36:34.992
YOU'D BE GOING FROM THREE

00:36:35.059 --> 00:36:36.227
THOUSAND DOLLARS TO ALMOST

00:36:36.294 --> 00:36:38.095
DOUBLE THAT AT WELL OVER DOUBLE

00:36:38.162 --> 00:36:40.798
THAT AT SIX THOUSAND TWO

00:36:40.865 --> 00:36:41.399
HUNDRED THIRTY SIX SO THERE'S

00:36:41.465 --> 00:36:42.767
REALLY STARK DIFFERENCE IF YOU

00:36:42.833 --> 00:36:44.602
LOOK AT HOW MUCH INFLATION HAS

00:36:44.669 --> 00:36:46.304
WOULD HAVE IMPACTED THESE

00:36:46.370 --> 00:36:51.208
NUMBERS IF THEY HAD CONTINUED.

00:36:51.275 --> 00:36:52.009
TO BE ADJUSTED. NEXT SLIDE

00:36:52.076 --> 00:36:56.314
PLEASE. SO THE FEDERAL MEDICAID

00:36:56.380 --> 00:36:58.115
ACT AND THERE'S A SITE THERE

00:36:58.182 --> 00:37:00.284
ARE TWO THE PROVISION WILL JUST

00:37:00.351 --> 00:37:03.054
CALL IT ARE TO DOES A LOT OF

00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:04.522
STATES USE LESS RESTRICTIVE

00:37:04.589 --> 00:37:05.990
METHODS THAN THOSE OUTLINED IN

00:37:06.057 --> 00:37:08.259
FEDERAL LAW TO DETERMINE INCOME

00:37:08.326 --> 00:37:09.994
AND RESOURCE ELIGIBILITY FOR

00:37:10.061 --> 00:37:11.395
THREE MAJOR CATEGORIES IN AND

00:37:11.462 --> 00:37:14.932
IT DOES IT ONLY UP DOES APPLY

00:37:14.999 --> 00:37:16.300
TO CERTAIN CATEGORIES. OF

00:37:16.367 --> 00:37:21.072
INDICATE EL ELIGIBLE- IN- BUT

00:37:21.138 --> 00:37:23.341
AMONG THOSE THREE OF THEM ARE

00:37:23.407 --> 00:37:24.575
FOR BELOW POVERTY SENIORS AND

00:37:24.642 --> 00:37:26.811
PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. THE

00:37:26.877 --> 00:37:28.479
MEDICALLY NECESSARY IT NEEDY

00:37:28.546 --> 00:37:31.749
POPULATION AND ALSO FOR M. S.

00:37:31.816 --> 00:37:34.218
P. AND ROWLEY'S. THE DEFINITION

00:37:34.285 --> 00:37:35.186
OF WHAT IT MEANS TO BE LESS

00:37:35.252 --> 00:37:37.455
RESTRICTIVE IS FAIRLY BROAD

00:37:37.521 --> 00:37:39.156
BASICALLY MEANS THAT BY USING

00:37:39.223 --> 00:37:41.525
THAT METHODOLOGY- MORE

00:37:41.592 --> 00:37:43.294
INDIVIDUALS MAY BE ELIGIBLE FOR

00:37:43.361 --> 00:37:45.396
MEDICAID AND THAT THERE WILL

00:37:45.463 --> 00:37:47.365
NOT BE OTHERS WHO BECOME

00:37:47.431 --> 00:37:49.233
INELIGIBLE BECAUSE OF THAT

00:37:49.300 --> 00:37:51.402
METHODOLOGY. ON AND SO IT

00:37:51.469 --> 00:37:52.837
REALLY IS INTENDED TO BE WHAT

00:37:52.903 --> 00:37:54.972
YOU WOULD THINK OF AS LESS

00:37:55.039 --> 00:37:59.677
RESTRICTIVE. SO IT SEEMS HAS

00:37:59.744 --> 00:38:02.613
PROVIDED GUIDANCE TO THE STATE-

00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:05.883
IN AS RECENTLY AS TWO THOUSAND

00:38:05.950 --> 00:38:06.484
FIFTEEN AND FROM WHICH SEEMS

00:38:06.550 --> 00:38:08.853
LIKE A VERY LONG TIME AGO BUT

00:38:08.919 --> 00:38:10.187
REALLY IN IN THE HISTORY OF

00:38:10.254 --> 00:38:11.656
MORE TALK ABOUT MEDICAID THINGS

00:38:11.722 --> 00:38:14.759
IT'S NOT THAT LONG AGO. I AND I

00:38:14.825 --> 00:38:16.560
SUGGESTED TO STATES THAT THEY

00:38:16.627 --> 00:38:17.995
MAY CONSIDER THIS FLEXIBILITY

00:38:18.062 --> 00:38:21.332
TO APPLY LESS RESTRICTIVE ASSET

00:38:21.399 --> 00:38:23.000
LEAD LIMITS. IN THAT LETTER CMS

00:38:23.067 --> 00:38:24.869
NOTED THAT ADOPTION OF THESE

00:38:24.935 --> 00:38:25.803
FLEXIBILITIES MAINLY TO A

00:38:25.870 --> 00:38:27.338
REDUCTION OF BURDEN ON THE

00:38:27.405 --> 00:38:29.306
BENEFICIARIES AND FOR STATE

00:38:29.373 --> 00:38:31.475
MEDICAID AGENCIES. PROMOTE

00:38:31.542 --> 00:38:33.544
CONTINUITY AND COVERAGE AND

00:38:33.611 --> 00:38:35.980
CARE. GENERATED MINISTRY OF

00:38:36.047 --> 00:38:38.215
SAVINGS BY SIMPLIFYING A MOMENT

00:38:38.282 --> 00:38:41.252
AMONG OTHER BENEFITS. CMS HAD

00:38:41.318 --> 00:38:43.254
FURTHER NOTED THAT ALABAMA

00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:45.456
MISSISSIPPI AND NEW YORK HAVE

00:38:45.523 --> 00:38:46.791
REPORTED AT LEAST SOME

00:38:46.857 --> 00:38:48.526
ADMINISTRATIVE SAVINGS FROM

00:38:48.592 --> 00:38:49.960
ELIMINATING ASSET TESTS AND

00:38:50.027 --> 00:38:51.328
THAT OBVIOUSLY MAKES SENSE

00:38:51.395 --> 00:38:53.130
BECAUSE THEN THE ELIGIBILITY

00:38:53.197 --> 00:38:54.932
WORKERS AREN'T SPENDING TIME

00:38:54.999 --> 00:38:56.934
CONFIRMING. HOW EXACTLY HOW

00:38:57.001 --> 00:38:58.002
MUCH MONEY SOMEBODY MAY HAVE A

00:38:58.069 --> 00:39:00.037
BANK ACCOUNT OR DOING FURTHER

00:39:00.104 --> 00:39:02.740
INVESTIGATIONS. UP COMPARED TO

00:39:02.807 --> 00:39:05.276
OTHER AREAS WHERE AT LEAST I

00:39:05.342 --> 00:39:07.978
WORK ON SOME OF WHICH THERE CAN

00:39:08.045 --> 00:39:10.881
BE SENSITIVITY FROM CMS- I AM

00:39:10.948 --> 00:39:12.283
NOT SEEN IN MY RESEARCH ANY

00:39:12.349 --> 00:39:14.785
PARTICULAR SENSITIVITIES BICMOS

00:39:14.852 --> 00:39:16.787
AROUND UTILIZING THE

00:39:16.854 --> 00:39:21.325
FLEXIBILITY GRANTED IN OUR TO-

00:39:21.392 --> 00:39:22.893
TO IMPLEMENT A LESS RESTRICTIVE

00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:24.929
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA SO IT'S

00:39:24.995 --> 00:39:29.667
NOT. ONE OF THOSE HOT. TOPICS

00:39:29.734 --> 00:39:30.601
THAT YOU MIGHT OTHERWISE SEE.

00:39:30.668 --> 00:39:35.206
NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SO AS I

00:39:35.272 --> 00:39:37.775
MENTIONED BEFORE CALIFORNIA HAS

00:39:37.842 --> 00:39:39.844
EXERCISE SOME OF ITS

00:39:39.910 --> 00:39:41.679
FLEXIBILITIES- TO APPLY LESS

00:39:41.746 --> 00:39:43.447
RESTRICTIVE ELIGIBILITY

00:39:43.514 --> 00:39:46.851
METHODS- AND I'M ASSUMING THAT

00:39:46.917 --> 00:39:49.086
SOME OF THE OTHER SPEAKERS

00:39:49.153 --> 00:39:49.687
TODAY WILL BE ABLE TO SPEAK ON

00:39:49.754 --> 00:39:55.292
THAT- SO. AND I APOLOGIZE WELL

00:39:55.359 --> 00:39:56.761
ESTIMATE EMPLOYMENT LESS

00:39:56.827 --> 00:39:58.028
RESTRICTIVE ELIGIBILITY

00:39:58.095 --> 00:39:59.864
STANDARDS SIMPLY THREE IS THE

00:39:59.930 --> 00:40:01.532
STATE PLAN AMENDMENT PROCESS

00:40:01.599 --> 00:40:02.833
WHICH IS TYPICALLY IN OUR

00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:04.668
REVIEW HOW WE'VE SEEN THESE-

00:40:04.735 --> 00:40:07.138
IMPLEMENTED I UNDERSTAND FROM

00:40:07.204 --> 00:40:08.873
MY REVIEW OF THE DH CS REPORT

00:40:08.939 --> 00:40:11.108
WHICH WAS ISSUED LAST YEAR THAT

00:40:11.175 --> 00:40:14.078
I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT CMS HAS

00:40:14.145 --> 00:40:15.412
ADVISED THAT IF THE STATE SEEKS

00:40:15.479 --> 00:40:16.947
TO APPLY DIFFERENT STANDARDS

00:40:17.014 --> 00:40:18.983
WITHIN AN ELIGIBILITY CALGARY

00:40:19.049 --> 00:40:20.885
FOR EXAMPLE BY DISTINGUISHING

00:40:20.951 --> 00:40:23.154
BETWEEN THE LONG TERM CARE

00:40:23.220 --> 00:40:24.121
MEDICALLY NEEDY AND OTHER

00:40:24.188 --> 00:40:25.756
MEDICALLY NIGHT OF NEEDY

00:40:25.823 --> 00:40:27.291
BENEFICIARIES THE STATE WILL

00:40:27.358 --> 00:40:29.160
ROCK NEED TO REQUEST A WAIVER

00:40:29.226 --> 00:40:31.829
OF CERTAIN MEDICAID ACT.

00:40:31.896 --> 00:40:37.968
REQUIREMENTS NEXT SLIDE PLEASE.

00:40:38.035 --> 00:40:41.605
SO THIS IS A SUMMARY BASED ON

00:40:41.672 --> 00:40:43.607
THE KAISER FAMILY FOUNDATION

00:40:43.674 --> 00:40:46.343
ISSUE PAPER FROM TWO THOUSAND

00:40:46.410 --> 00:40:48.813
NINETEEN ON- WHAT OTHER STATES

00:40:48.879 --> 00:40:50.848
HAVE APPLIED LESS RESTRICTIVE

00:40:50.915 --> 00:40:52.082
ABSENT MOMENTS ACTUALLY THAT

00:40:52.149 --> 00:40:53.184
ISSUE PAPER GOES THROUGH AND

00:40:53.250 --> 00:40:55.019
DISCUSSES ALL OF THE ASSET

00:40:55.085 --> 00:41:00.825
LIMITS THAT APPLY IN YOUR.

00:41:00.891 --> 00:41:02.560
LADIES AMONG VARIOUS. BUT IT IN

00:41:02.626 --> 00:41:05.629

FIFTEEN THE ARIZONA HAD. ITS

HAD SEE REAL A MINUTE SAVE. AND

00:42:45.062 --> 00:42:46.263
THEN WE'LL FOCUS ON YOUR

00:42:46.330 --> 00:42:48.198
BECAUSE AFTER HELL NEW YORK

00:42:48.265 --> 00:42:50.301

INDIVIDUALS RECEIVING LONG TERM

00:43:18.329 --> 00:43:20.864
CARE AGAIN THAT'S NOT UNUSUAL

00:43:20.931 --> 00:43:22.666
GIVEN THE COSTS THAT MEDICAID

00:43:22.733 --> 00:43:25.102
PROGRAMS EXPAND ON LONG TERM

00:43:25.169 --> 00:43:27.638
CARE BENEFITS. OF PARTICULAR

00:43:27.705 --> 00:43:29.106
NOTE- WHEN WE WERE DOING OUR

00:43:29.173 --> 00:43:30.574
REVIEW RESEARCH WAS THE

00:43:30.641 --> 00:43:32.509
EVIDENCE FROM CMS THAT ARIZONA

00:43:32.576 --> 00:43:34.345
HAD IMPLEMENTED THE CHANGE

00:43:34.411 --> 00:43:36.146
AFTER CONTENT DUCTING AN IMPACT

00:43:36.213 --> 00:43:37.715
STUDY WHICH FOUND THAT

00:43:37.781 --> 00:43:39.249
ADMINISTRATORS SAVINGS WOULD

00:43:39.316 --> 00:43:40.884
ROUGHLY EQUAL THE COST OF THE

00:43:40.951 --> 00:43:42.953
ADDITIONAL BENEFITS OF TAT

00:43:43.020 --> 00:43:45.289
WOULD BE. GRANTED IF THEY

00:43:45.356 --> 00:43:48.359
ELIMINATE THOSE ASSET TESTS- I

00:43:48.425 --> 00:43:49.727
UNDERSTAND FROM THE DH CS

00:43:49.793 --> 00:43:51.528
REPORT THE DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN

00:43:51.595 --> 00:43:52.830
STATE MEDICAID OFFICIALS HAVE

00:43:52.896 --> 00:43:54.665
CONFIRMED- THAT THEY WERE THAT

00:43:54.732 --> 00:43:57.034
ARIZONA HAD SEEN ADMINISTRATIVE

00:43:57.101 --> 00:43:58.902
COSTS AND SAVINGS IT'S NOT

00:43:58.969 --> 00:44:01.238
CLEAR FROM THE DH CS REPORT HOW

00:44:01.305 --> 00:44:02.573
WHETHER OR NOT ARIZONA HAD

00:44:02.639 --> 00:44:06.610
COMPARED THOSE SAVINGS. TO THE

00:44:06.677 --> 00:44:07.177
INCREASED COST OF BENEFITS.

00:44:07.244 --> 00:44:10.914
THANK SLIDE PLEASE. SO AGAIN

00:44:10.981 --> 00:44:12.149
NEW YORK HAS THE SECOND LARGEST

00:44:12.216 --> 00:44:14.618
PROGRAM AFTER CALIFORNIA IT'S

00:44:14.685 --> 00:44:16.887
DETERMINE IT HAS ELIMINATED THE

00:44:16.954 --> 00:44:18.322
ASSET TEST FOR ALL OF ITS A

00:44:18.389 --> 00:44:20.958
MESS PAEAN ROWLEY'S AND REYES

00:44:21.025 --> 00:44:22.593
ITS ASSET LIMITS FOR ITS AGE

00:44:22.659 --> 00:44:23.994
BLIND AND DISABLED BELOW

00:44:24.061 --> 00:44:26.063
POVERTY ENROLLEES INCLUDING

THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY

00:44:34.905 --> 00:44:36.607
DOLLARS FOR A COUPLE. AND SO

00:44:36.673 --> 00:44:38.075
THOSE ARE AGAIN MUCH HIGHER

00:44:38.142 --> 00:44:40.577
THAN WHAT CALIFORNIANS

00:44:40.644 --> 00:44:41.512
CURRENTLY APPLYING- I

00:44:41.578 --> 00:44:43.447
UNDERSTAND FROM THE DH REPORT

00:44:43.514 --> 00:44:44.882
THAT NEW YORK LIKE LA ARIZONA

00:44:44.948 --> 00:44:45.883
HAS EXPERIENCED BOTH

00:44:45.949 --> 00:44:47.251
ADMINISTRATIVE SAVINGS AND

00:44:47.317 --> 00:44:48.585
ADDITIONAL COSTS FOR THE

00:44:48.652 --> 00:44:53.090
ADDITIONAL BENEFITS. AND THEN

00:44:53.157 --> 00:44:53.724
TO KNOW THE CALIFORNIA LIKE NEW

00:44:53.791 --> 00:44:56.293
YORK. IT LIKE CALIFORNIA NEW

00:44:56.360 --> 00:44:57.895
YORK HAS EXCLUDES CERTAIN TYPES

00:44:57.961 --> 00:44:59.363
OF ASSETS FROM BEING COUNTED IN

00:44:59.430 --> 00:45:01.098
THIS IS ANOTHER AREA WHERE THEY

00:45:01.165 --> 00:45:02.499
CAN BE A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY

00:45:02.566 --> 00:45:04.935
DONE WHERE THEY CAN. THEY

00:45:05.002 --> 00:45:06.637
THEY'VE DECIDED TO EXCLUDE

00:45:06.703 --> 00:45:08.739
THINGS LIKE CARS THE VALUE OF

00:45:08.806 --> 00:45:09.640
LONG TERM CARE BENEFITS AND

00:45:09.706 --> 00:45:12.509
OTHER THINGS FROM BEING COUNTED

00:45:12.576 --> 00:45:17.047
AS ASSETS. SO THEN NEXT SLIDE

00:45:17.114 --> 00:45:22.453
PLEASE. SO THEN WHAT WE

00:45:22.519 --> 00:45:24.288
CONCLUDED IN THE CALIFORNIA

00:45:24.354 --> 00:45:26.323
HEALTH CARE FOUNDATION REPORT

00:45:26.390 --> 00:45:28.992
WAS REALLY THINKING ABOUT WHAT

00:45:29.059 --> 00:45:30.794
WHAT WHAT WHAT WERE

00:45:30.861 --> 00:45:32.396
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE HAD AS

00:45:32.463 --> 00:45:33.730
WELL HOW THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT

00:45:33.797 --> 00:45:36.133
CONSIDER HOW TO SHAPE FUTURE

00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:38.836
POLICY AROUND THE ASSET TEST-

00:45:38.902 --> 00:45:40.604
AND YOU KNOW WHAT THERE'S OLD

00:45:40.671 --> 00:45:43.307
SCALE AND ALL COMES DOWN TO HOW

00:45:43.373 --> 00:45:44.641
ON EVERYBODY ON THESE

00:45:44.708 --> 00:45:45.943
COMMITTEES IN THE LEGISLATURE

00:45:46.009 --> 00:45:46.743
ENDS UP WEIGHING THESE

00:45:46.810 --> 00:45:48.912
DIFFERENT CONSIDERATIONS BUT-

00:45:48.979 --> 00:45:50.614
YOU KNOW ON THE ONE HAND YOU

00:45:50.681 --> 00:45:52.783
HAVE A POTENTIAL INCREASE IN

00:45:52.850 --> 00:45:54.551
APPLICATIONS FROM THE CHANGE

00:45:54.618 --> 00:45:56.520
POLICY WHICH WILL THEN OF

00:45:56.587 --> 00:45:59.423
COURSE LEAD TO IMPROVE CREASE

00:45:59.490 --> 00:46:03.627
PROGRAM COSTS. BUT ON THE OTHER

00:46:03.694 --> 00:46:04.361
YOU HAVE REDUCED ADMIN COSTS

00:46:04.428 --> 00:46:06.396
WHICH YOU SEE TO HAVE CONFIRMED

00:46:06.463 --> 00:46:07.631
BY QUITE A FEW OF THE STATES

00:46:07.698 --> 00:46:08.465
THAT HAVE DONE THIS IN THE

00:46:08.532 --> 00:46:11.268
PAST. YOU CAN OKAY ONE OF THE

00:46:11.335 --> 00:46:12.703
OPTIONS WITH YOU WOULD BE ABLE

00:46:12.769 --> 00:46:14.638
TO ACCOUNT FOR INFLATION SO IF

00:46:14.705 --> 00:46:15.706
YOU'RE ACTUALLY JUST

00:46:15.772 --> 00:46:18.842
IMPLEMENTING R. I. A. N.

00:46:18.909 --> 00:46:19.810
INCREASE RATHER THAN

00:46:19.877 --> 00:46:21.078
ELIMINATING ASSET TESTS

00:46:21.145 --> 00:46:22.946
ALTOGETHER YOU COULD NOT LEAST.

00:46:23.013 --> 00:46:24.481
FROM A POLICY PERSPECTIVE

00:46:24.548 --> 00:46:25.616
THERE'S A REASON TO WANT TO BE

00:46:25.682 --> 00:46:28.952
ABLE TO ACCOUNT FOR IT CAUGHT

00:46:29.019 --> 00:46:29.553
INCREASED COST OF LIVING YEAR

00:46:29.620 --> 00:46:30.721
AFTER YEAR. AND THEN THE LAST

00:46:30.787 --> 00:46:32.789
IS DEAD YOU KNOW TO ALLOW

00:46:32.856 --> 00:46:34.758
SENIORS TO CONTINUE TO HAVE A

00:46:34.825 --> 00:46:36.760
RAINY DAY FUND. THERE'S

00:46:36.827 --> 00:46:38.428
SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT TO

00:46:38.495 --> 00:46:40.364
THAT WHEN YOU LOOK AT YOU KNOW

00:46:40.430 --> 00:46:42.065
THE COST OF LIVING RIGHT NOW

00:46:42.132 --> 00:46:43.400
AND I'M TESTIFYING RIGHT NOW

00:46:43.467 --> 00:46:45.536
I'M- ACTUALLY IN. ASSEMBLY

00:46:45.602 --> 00:46:47.538
MEMBER KINGS DISTRICT. YOU KNOW

00:46:47.604 --> 00:46:49.706
THE COST OF LIVING HAS GROWN SO

00:46:49.773 --> 00:46:52.042
HIGH THAT THE IDEA OF. BEING

00:46:52.109 --> 00:46:54.444
ABLE TO JONES HAVE TWO OR THREE

00:46:54.511 --> 00:46:55.212
THOUSAND DOLLARS IN YOUR BANK

00:46:55.279 --> 00:46:57.281
ACCOUNT IN TERMS OF SAVINGS IS

00:46:57.347 --> 00:47:00.083
MEAGER. AND SO BE ABLE TO BE

00:47:00.150 --> 00:47:01.285
ABLE TO ALLOW THERE TO BE A

00:47:01.351 --> 00:47:02.986
RETENTION FOR RAINY DAY FUND

00:47:03.053 --> 00:47:04.521
CAN REALLY MEAN ALL THE

00:47:04.588 --> 00:47:05.756
DIFFERENCE IF THERE'S AN

00:47:05.822 --> 00:47:08.358
UNEXPECTED. INCIDENT THAT

00:47:08.425 --> 00:47:10.460
OCCURS- FOR SOMEBODY WHO A

WHO HAS A MEDICAL ROLLINGSTONE.

00:47:14.865 --> 00:47:15.632
THAT THAT WOULD BE ANOTHER

00:47:15.699 --> 00:47:19.870
CONSIDERATION. FOR THE

00:48:37.514 --> 00:48:39.616
APPLIES A HIGHER LIMIT OF

00:48:39.683 --> 00:48:41.818
FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS. SEVEN

00:48:41.885 --> 00:48:42.653
HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS FOR AN

00:48:42.719 --> 00:48:46.657
INDIVIDUAL AND TWENTY THREE

00:48:46.723 --> 00:48:47.291
THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY

00:48:47.357 --> 00:48:50.093
FOR A COUPLE. FOR MEDICARE'S A

00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:51.895
SAVINGS PROGRAM ELIGIBILITY AS

00:48:51.962 --> 00:48:53.697
I MENTIONED EARLIER MANY STATES

00:48:53.764 --> 00:48:55.832
APPLY NO LIMITS IMENA MINNESOTA

00:48:55.899 --> 00:48:57.234
HAVE HIGHER LIMITS THAN WHAT IS

00:48:57.301 --> 00:49:00.103
BEING CONSIDERED BY CALIFORNIA-

00:49:00.170 --> 00:49:03.607
AND SO. AGAIN THAT IS AN AREA

00:49:03.674 --> 00:49:05.509
WHERE WE WOULD BE WELL WITHIN

00:49:05.575 --> 00:49:07.778
THE PRACTICE OF OTHER STATES IF

00:49:07.844 --> 00:49:10.881
WE CONSIDERED A PROPOSAL WITH A

00:49:10.947 --> 00:49:12.115
TEN THOUSAND DOLLAR ASSET LIMIT

00:49:12.182 --> 00:49:15.886
FOR AN INDIVIDUAL. AND FIVE

00:49:15.952 --> 00:49:16.386
THOUSAND FOR ADDITIONAL

00:49:16.453 --> 00:49:17.954
HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS. THEN THE

00:49:18.021 --> 00:49:20.090
LAST QUESTION- REALLY THAT THE

00:49:20.157 --> 00:49:21.692
LEGISLATURE WOULD TO CONSPIRACY

00:49:21.758 --> 00:49:23.060
TO CONSIDER AND PROBABLY GOES

00:49:23.126 --> 00:49:24.194
HAND IN HAND WITH DISSIDENT

00:49:24.261 --> 00:49:26.863
CITING HOW TO SHAPE THE ASSET

00:49:26.930 --> 00:49:29.366
TEST IN THE FUTURE. IS WHETHER

00:49:29.433 --> 00:49:32.936
WHICH ELIGIBILITY CATEGORIES ON

00:49:33.003 --> 00:49:33.570
THE LEGISLATION WANTS TO

00:49:33.637 --> 00:49:35.672
PROCEED AND MAKE THOSE CHANGES

00:49:35.739 --> 00:49:36.840
FOR AND WHETHER TO EXCLUDE

00:49:36.907 --> 00:49:38.308
INDIVIDUALS WITHIN ELIGIBILITY

00:49:38.375 --> 00:49:39.576
CRAP CATEGORIES IN THE MOST

00:49:39.643 --> 00:49:41.745
OBVIOUS PLACE THERE IS WHETHER

00:49:41.812 --> 00:49:44.081
TO EXCLUDE INDIVIDUALS WHO

00:49:44.147 --> 00:49:44.981
RECEIVE LONG TERM CARE

00:49:45.048 --> 00:49:47.417
BENEFITS. OFF FROM THE ACID

00:49:47.484 --> 00:49:49.152
TEST IN THAT IS REALLY MOSTLY A

00:49:49.219 --> 00:49:51.355
FINANCIAL QUESTION OF HOW MUCH

00:49:51.421 --> 00:49:53.123
MORE OF BENEFITS WOULD NEED TO

00:49:53.190 --> 00:49:58.028
BE GRANTED IN ORDER TO IT TO

00:49:58.095 --> 00:50:00.330
INCLUDE THOSE INDIVIDUALS. NEXT

00:50:00.397 --> 00:50:03.967
SLIDE PLEASE. SO THAT CONCLUDES

00:50:04.034 --> 00:50:07.738
MY REMARKS- OPEN TO ANY

00:50:07.804 --> 00:50:10.240

MEMBERS WHO HAVE COME IN AND

00:50:14.978 --> 00:50:16.446
THEY THEY'RE GOING TO- I'D LIKE

00:50:16.513 --> 00:50:17.347
TO GIVE THEM AN OPPORTUNITY TO

00:50:17.414 --> 00:50:18.715
SAY A FEW WORDS IF AND THEN

00:50:18.782 --> 00:50:19.750
WE'LL HAVE SOME QUESTIONS IF

00:50:19.816 --> 00:50:21.318
THAT'S IF THAT'S OKAY WITH YOU

00:50:21.385 --> 00:50:22.586

MEDICAL ASSETS TEST PIECE OF

00:50:38.301 --> 00:50:39.669
LEGISLATION FOR THE PAST FEW

00:50:39.736 --> 00:50:41.638
YEARS NOW AND EACH TIME IT IT

00:50:41.705 --> 00:50:43.206
STOPS AND DOES NOT MOVE FORWARD

00:50:43.273 --> 00:50:45.475
BECAUSE OF COST. BUT NOW MORE

00:50:45.542 --> 00:50:47.611
THAN EVER IT IS VERY CLEAR-

00:50:47.677 --> 00:50:48.945
ESPECIALLY DURING THE PANDEMIC

00:50:49.012 --> 00:50:50.147
THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:50:50.213 --> 00:50:52.282
WE ARE WORKING ON LEGISLATION

00:50:52.349 --> 00:50:53.183
THAT IMPACTS OUR MOST

00:50:53.250 --> 00:50:55.318
VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES AND THAT

00:50:55.385 --> 00:50:56.052
IF YOU ARE IF YOU'VE DONE

FAMILY WEALTH YOU SHOULD NOT BE

PENALIZED BASED ON ANTIQUATED

00:51:08.298 --> 00:51:09.166
LAWS THAT ACTUALLY MAKE IT

00:51:09.232 --> 00:51:11.101

HAVE TO LIQUIDATE ALL YOUR ALL

00:51:18.275 --> 00:51:19.976
OF YOUR SAVINGS. THAT'S NOT THE

00:51:20.043 --> 00:51:21.511
KIND OF CALIFORNIA THAT WE WANT

00:51:21.578 --> 00:51:22.646

IT IS A POLICY THAT NO LONGER

00:51:36.059 --> 00:51:37.994
WORKS IT ACTUALLY NEVER HAS AND

00:51:38.061 --> 00:51:40.330
CALIFORNIA CAN'T BE BEHIND

00:51:40.397 --> 00:51:42.032
OTHER STATES ACROSS THE NATION

00:51:42.098 --> 00:51:43.233
IN TERMS OF HOW WE TAKE CARE OF

00:51:43.300 --> 00:51:45.335

A GLOBAL PANDEMIC. WHERE WE

00:52:00.617 --> 00:52:02.452

WHAT OTHER COST SAVINGS I THINK

00:52:26.476 --> 00:52:27.377
THROUGH THERE. AND I THINK WE

00:52:27.444 --> 00:52:34.251
NEED TO- STATE FARM. DOLLAR

00:52:34.317 --> 00:52:36.119

THANK YOU. ANY SPECIFIC FROM.

00:52:58.141 --> 00:53:03.780
MISTER DOCTOR. I YOU- FIRST OFF

00:53:03.847 --> 00:53:05.715
I HEARING ANOTHER ONE WHO CAN

00:53:05.782 --> 00:53:07.450
REALLY GET INTO THE DETAILS

00:53:07.517 --> 00:53:11.721
UNTIL ONE TO DO A PRE- WHAT YOU

00:53:11.788 --> 00:53:14.424
ADDED I WANT TO GET BETTER IF I

00:53:14.491 --> 00:53:15.592
COULD ABOUT ARIZONA WHICH IS

00:53:15.659 --> 00:53:20.797
CONDUCT IN IMPACT. THEY WERE

00:53:20.864 --> 00:53:23.300
ANALYZED BEFORE US WE SEE THAT

00:53:23.366 --> 00:53:27.037
THE- TOTAL COST OF THE PROGRAM

00:53:27.103 --> 00:53:28.538
PURSES THE ELIMINATION OF THE

00:53:28.605 --> 00:53:30.440
ASSET VERIFICATION THE SAVINGS

00:53:30.507 --> 00:53:32.208
ARE NOT ROUGHLY EQUAL AND SO

00:53:32.275 --> 00:53:33.743
I'M WONDERING A LITTLE BIT

00:53:33.810 --> 00:53:35.745
ABOUT THIS IMPACT STUDY. DID

00:53:35.812 --> 00:53:38.148
THEY HAVE- WHAT TYPE OF

00:53:38.214 --> 00:53:39.816
INFORMATION THAT THEY PROVIDE

00:53:39.883 --> 00:53:41.885
FROM THIS IMPACT STUDY WOULD BE

00:53:41.952 --> 00:53:43.587
A BENEFIT FOR CALIFORNIA TO

00:53:43.653 --> 00:53:45.288
HAVE AN IMPACT STUDY WOULD IT

00:53:45.355 --> 00:53:47.524
BETTER ALLOW US TO UNDERSTAND

00:53:47.591 --> 00:53:49.092
THE REAL COST. THAT COULD BE

00:53:49.159 --> 00:53:53.063
SAVED. THANK YOU DR ARAMBULA

00:53:53.129 --> 00:53:54.998
WHAT I THINK OCCURRED IN

00:53:55.065 --> 00:53:56.933
ARIZONA IS PRIOR TO

00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:58.568
IMPLEMENTING THEY HAD PERFORMED

00:53:58.635 --> 00:54:01.004
IN IMPACTS STUDY. ON WHAT I

00:54:01.071 --> 00:54:02.906
SUSPECT A IN AND THAT IMPACT

00:54:02.973 --> 00:54:04.808
STUDY DID SHOW THAT THEY HAD

00:54:04.874 --> 00:54:07.110
ANTICIPATED THE SAVINGS TO

00:54:07.177 --> 00:54:09.212
EXCEED THE ADDITIONAL BENEFITS.

00:54:09.279 --> 00:54:10.046
ARE ONE THING THAT'S REALLY

00:54:10.113 --> 00:54:12.182
IMPORTANT NOTED NOTE AND THIS

00:54:12.248 --> 00:54:13.950
IS ALSO NOTED I THINK IN THE

00:54:14.017 --> 00:54:16.019
DHS REPORT IS THEY DID EXCLUDE

00:54:16.086 --> 00:54:17.587
THEIR LONG TERM CARE

00:54:17.654 --> 00:54:18.955
BENEFICIARIES AND THAT'S AN

00:54:19.022 --> 00:54:19.923
AREA WHERE YOU I THINK YOU'RE

00:54:19.990 --> 00:54:21.725
GOING TO SEE A LOT MORE COST-

00:54:21.791 --> 00:54:23.927
IT OF ADDITIONAL BENEFITS. IF

00:54:23.994 --> 00:54:26.963
THEY'RE ELIGIBLE- WHAT I EXPECT

00:54:27.030 --> 00:54:28.932
HAPPENED AND I THINK THE FOLKS

00:54:28.999 --> 00:54:30.066
AT THE DEPARTMENT WHO ACTUALLY

00:54:30.133 --> 00:54:32.035
SPOKE TO THE ARIZONA STATE

00:54:32.102 --> 00:54:34.037
MEDICAID OFFICIALS CAN CONFIRM.

00:54:34.104 --> 00:54:35.572
IS MY SUSPICION IS THAT THEY

00:54:35.639 --> 00:54:38.908
ACTUALLY DID SEE BEN AND I DID

00:54:38.975 --> 00:54:40.176
SEE A MINISTRY OF COST SAVINGS.

00:54:40.243 --> 00:54:41.911
THERE PROBABLY WASN'T QUITE

00:54:41.978 --> 00:54:44.381
EQUAL SO IT'S PROBABLY THAT THE

00:54:44.447 --> 00:54:47.283
COST SAVINGS WERE NOT QUITE AS

00:54:47.350 --> 00:54:48.752
MUCH AS THE OF MINE THE

00:54:48.818 --> 00:54:50.687
POTENTIAL BENEFITS BUT I WOULD

00:54:50.754 --> 00:54:52.689
DEFER TO THE FOLKS AT DHS WHO

00:54:52.756 --> 00:54:57.227
SPOKE DIRECTLY. TO THE ARIZONA

00:54:57.293 --> 00:54:59.663
STATE MEDICAID OFFICIALS. IF I

00:54:59.729 --> 00:55:01.064
COULD I JUST WANT TO FOLLOW ON

00:55:01.131 --> 00:55:03.600
ONE FINAL POINT WHICH IS. YOUR

00:55:03.667 --> 00:55:04.567
STATEMENT WAS THE INCREASED

00:55:04.634 --> 00:55:06.002
COST COMES FROM INCREASED

00:55:06.069 --> 00:55:07.804
APPLICANTS WHO ARE ON THE

00:55:07.871 --> 00:55:09.939
MEDICAL PROGRAM. I'M TRYING TO

00:55:10.006 --> 00:55:11.408
UNDERSTAND SCOPE FOR EACH OF

00:55:11.474 --> 00:55:13.043
THE OPTIONS THAT ARE PRESENTED

00:55:13.109 --> 00:55:14.310
TO US AND IT SEEMS THAT THE

00:55:14.377 --> 00:55:16.413
ELIMINATION OF THE ASSET TEST

00:55:16.479 --> 00:55:17.213
AT LEAST FROM THE DATA WE HAVE

00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:21.251
IN FRONT OF US. IS A TOTAL OF

00:55:21.317 --> 00:55:21.751
SEVENTEEN THOUSAND EIGHT

00:55:21.818 --> 00:55:22.819
HUNDRED INDIVIDUALS IS THAT

00:55:22.886 --> 00:55:26.990
CORRECT. THAT'S WHAT I'VE SEEN

00:55:27.057 --> 00:55:29.225
IN THE DHS REPORT AGAIN I DON'T

00:55:29.292 --> 00:55:30.593
WORK FOR THE DEPARTMENT SO I

00:55:30.660 --> 00:55:32.429
CAN'T CONFIRM THOSE NUMBERS BUT

00:55:32.495 --> 00:55:33.797
THEY DO SEEM LIKE THEY- BEGIN

00:55:33.863 --> 00:55:35.432
AND I THINK THE IMPORTANT THING

00:55:35.498 --> 00:55:36.499
TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT FOR A LOT

00:55:36.566 --> 00:55:37.934
OF THESE INDIVIDUALS. THEY

00:55:38.001 --> 00:55:39.502
WOULD EVENTUALLY SPEND DOWN TO

00:55:39.569 --> 00:55:41.738
QUALIFY FOR MEDICAID. AND SO

00:55:41.805 --> 00:55:43.306
IT'S A QUESTION OF WHEN THEY

00:55:43.373 --> 00:55:45.508
BECOME ELIGIBLE RATHER RATHER

00:55:45.575 --> 00:55:46.576
THAN WHETHER OR NOT THEY WOULD

00:55:46.643 --> 00:55:48.178
EVER BECOME ELIGIBLE SO IT'S A

00:55:48.244 --> 00:55:49.979
TIMING ISSUE. AND IF THEY DON'T

00:55:50.046 --> 00:55:51.481
HAVE TO SPEND DOWN THEN THEY'D

00:55:51.548 --> 00:55:52.882
BE ABLE TO RETAIN SOME OF THOSE

00:55:52.949 --> 00:55:55.452
ASSETS. AND ACHIEVE ELIGIBILITY

00:55:55.518 --> 00:55:56.820
EARLIER BUT THEN THEY WOULD

00:55:56.886 --> 00:56:00.190
STILL BE RECEIVING BENEFITS THE

00:56:00.256 --> 00:56:00.824
WAY THEY WENT LATER ON DOWN THE

00:56:00.890 --> 00:56:02.726
LINE. FINAL QUESTION IF I COULD

00:56:02.792 --> 00:56:05.395
IS- THE ADMINISTRATION HAS

00:56:05.462 --> 00:56:07.564
PREDICTED. CASELOAD GROWTH ONE

00:56:07.630 --> 00:56:09.532
POINT SIX MILLION INDIVIDUALS

00:56:09.599 --> 00:56:11.234
OVER WHERE WE CURRENTLY ARE

00:56:11.301 --> 00:56:14.971
TODAY. IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THE-

00:56:15.038 --> 00:56:17.474
COST COULD BE INCLUDED INTO THE

00:56:17.540 --> 00:56:18.742
INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE ALREADY

00:56:18.808 --> 00:56:20.009
CALCULATED INTO THE

00:56:20.076 --> 00:56:22.112
ADMINISTRATION'S. MEDIC CAL

00:56:22.178 --> 00:56:23.947
GOAL. AND US WHAT WE'RE

00:56:24.013 --> 00:56:25.582
ACTUALLY SEEING OR THE SAVINGS

00:56:25.648 --> 00:56:27.784
FROM THE ADMINISTRATIVE COST

00:56:27.851 --> 00:56:30.587
OVERALL IN THIS BUDGET YEAR. SO

00:56:30.653 --> 00:56:32.322
MY UNDERSTANDING AND I WAS

00:56:32.388 --> 00:56:34.958
LOOKING AT THE DEPARTMENTS

00:56:35.024 --> 00:56:37.393
PREDICTIONS AS TO AT THE GROWTH

00:56:37.460 --> 00:56:39.362
OF THE PROGRAM A COUPLE MONTHS

00:56:39.429 --> 00:56:40.764
AGO FOR SOME OTHER WORK THAT I

00:56:40.830 --> 00:56:43.133
WAS DOING- ON FIGURING OUT WHAT

00:56:43.199 --> 00:56:44.200
THE F. MAP WAS GOING TO LOOK

00:56:44.267 --> 00:56:45.902
LIKE. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT

00:56:45.969 --> 00:56:47.437
A LOT OF THAT IS INTENDED IF

00:56:47.504 --> 00:56:49.339
THAT IS ANTICIPATED TO COME

00:56:49.405 --> 00:56:51.274
FROM SOME OF THE NEWLY ELIGIBLE

00:56:51.341 --> 00:56:53.109
INDIVIDUALS WHO MAY HAVE LOST

00:56:53.176 --> 00:56:55.445
THEIR JOBS AND THEREFORE. HAVE

00:56:55.512 --> 00:56:57.313
LOST EMPLOYER BASED INSURANCE I

00:56:57.380 --> 00:56:59.449
THINK THAT'S LIKELY LARGELY

00:56:59.516 --> 00:57:01.384
GOING TO BE COMING FROM OTHER

00:57:01.451 --> 00:57:03.219
CATEGORIES OF ELIGIBLE

00:57:03.286 --> 00:57:05.054
INDIVIDUALS WE'RE HERE WORKING

00:57:05.121 --> 00:57:07.090
BECAUSE THOSE NEWLY ELIGIBLE

00:57:07.157 --> 00:57:08.825
APPLICANTS WOULD BE A LOT OF

00:57:08.892 --> 00:57:10.426
THAT SUBJECT BOUNCE BACK AND

00:57:10.493 --> 00:57:12.462
NOT TO AN ASSET TEST WE'RE HERE

00:57:12.529 --> 00:57:13.329
WE'RE LOOKING AT SENIORS AND

00:57:13.396 --> 00:57:14.898
PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND SO

00:57:14.964 --> 00:57:16.432
I THINK. THE LIKELIHOOD THAT

00:57:16.499 --> 00:57:17.767
WE'RE SEEING THE SAME IMPACT

00:57:17.834 --> 00:57:19.102
THEIR SOME OF THEM THAT ARE

00:57:19.169 --> 00:57:20.370
GOING TO HAVE INCREASED

00:57:20.436 --> 00:57:22.338
EXPENSES DUE TO THE SHUT DOWN

00:57:22.405 --> 00:57:23.807
BECAUSE OF HOW MUCH HAS

00:57:23.873 --> 00:57:25.341
AFFECTED OUR ECONOMY AS A

00:57:25.408 --> 00:57:27.377
WHOLE- BUT- YOU KNOW BASED ON

00:57:27.443 --> 00:57:28.611
WHAT I LOOKED AT A COUPLE

00:57:28.678 --> 00:57:30.146
MONTHS AGO I ON'T KNOW THAT

00:57:30.213 --> 00:57:31.881
THAT WOULD THOSE WOULD BE THE

00:57:31.948 --> 00:57:37.220
SAME INDIVIDUALS. I WON MY COMP

00:57:37.287 --> 00:57:39.622
THERE BUT SIMPLY BELIEVE THAT

00:57:39.689 --> 00:57:40.824
THEN BECOME A DISCUSS FOR A AS

00:57:40.890 --> 00:57:42.725
A LEAD. WHEN OR NOT THE INCLUDE

00:57:42.792 --> 00:57:44.627
IN THE- SENSE WE DID NOT SEE

00:57:44.694 --> 00:57:47.230
THOSE PROTECTIONS MATERIALIZE

00:57:47.297 --> 00:57:49.065
IN THE LAST YEAR I THINK IT'S

00:57:49.132 --> 00:57:52.235
IMPORTANT FOR US TO. PRIORITIZE

00:57:52.302 --> 00:57:54.003
OUR VALUES AS WELL SO WE JUST

00:57:54.070 --> 00:57:56.105
ENCOURAGE THE CONTINUED

00:57:56.172 --> 00:57:58.074
CONVERSATION. THANK YOU VERY

00:57:58.141 --> 00:57:59.209
MUCH DOCTOR REGULAR AND I THINK

00:57:59.275 --> 00:58:00.710
THAT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT POINT

00:58:00.777 --> 00:58:02.645
THE PROJECTED- GROWTH IN THE

00:58:02.712 --> 00:58:03.780
PROGRAM DIDN'T HAPPEN AND I

00:58:03.847 --> 00:58:05.882
THINK THAT'S THAT THAT IS THAT

00:58:05.949 --> 00:58:07.717
IS THAT IS SIGNIFICANT- YOU

00:58:07.784 --> 00:58:09.819
MENTIONED LIKE. LIKE IN ARIZONA

00:58:09.886 --> 00:58:10.920
HE SAID THAT THERE'S AN

00:58:10.987 --> 00:58:13.356
EXCLUSION FOR LONG TERM CARE

00:58:13.423 --> 00:58:15.859
BENEFITS CORRECT IS THAT. I

00:58:15.925 --> 00:58:17.227
THINK THAT'S ON YOUR CHART.

00:58:17.293 --> 00:58:17.994
THAT'S CORRECT SO THAT THE

00:58:18.061 --> 00:58:20.463
INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE ELIGIBLE

00:58:20.530 --> 00:58:21.097
FOR LONG TERM CARE BENEFITS ARE

00:58:21.164 --> 00:58:23.266
EX. ARE EXCLUDED FROM EXCLUSION

00:58:23.333 --> 00:58:25.268
FROM A SET TEST SO THEY ARE

00:58:25.335 --> 00:58:27.437
SUBJECT TO AN ASSET TEST STILL-

00:58:27.503 --> 00:58:29.005
AND AS I MENTIONED YOU KNOW

00:58:29.072 --> 00:58:30.306
MEDIC CAL PAID FOR I THINK IT

00:58:30.373 --> 00:58:31.908
WAS THE LAST TIME I CHECKED WAS

00:58:31.975 --> 00:58:33.509
WHEN LIKE 90% OF THE LONG TERM

00:58:33.576 --> 00:58:35.712
CARE IN THE STATE. RIGHT AND SO

00:58:35.778 --> 00:58:38.081
THAT'S WHERE THERE'S- IS LONG

00:58:38.147 --> 00:58:40.984
TERM SYSTEM COST HIGH. BE

00:58:41.050 --> 00:58:43.519
YOU'RE PAYING RATE. AND THEN IS

00:58:43.586 --> 00:58:44.354
IT'S WON'T BECAUSE FOR MOST OF

00:58:44.420 --> 00:58:45.288
THE INDIVIDUAL WERE TALKING

00:58:45.355 --> 00:58:47.023
ABOUT LONG TERM LONG TERM CARE.

00:58:47.090 --> 00:58:48.658
AND SO THERE WERE PAYING FOR

00:58:48.725 --> 00:58:53.897
THE THAT SERVICE UNTIL YOU KNOW.

00:58:53.963 --> 00:58:54.964
THE END OF THEIR LIVES. THE

00:58:55.031 --> 00:58:56.165
YOU. AND I WOULD AGREE I WENT

00:58:56.232 --> 00:58:57.934
AS- AGREE STRONGLY WITH THE-

00:58:58.001 --> 00:58:59.035
DOCTOR AND YOU LIE THIS I THINK

00:58:59.102 --> 00:59:00.303
THIS A STATE. OF OUR FOR. ARE

00:59:00.370 --> 00:59:01.771
QUITE FOR. AND I DO WONDER YOU

00:59:01.838 --> 00:59:03.673
KNOW AS AS PEOPLE ARE HOT

00:59:03.740 --> 00:59:05.408
ALLOWED TO HAVE LESS AND LESS.

00:59:05.475 --> 00:59:07.110
OF A RAINY DAY FUND WHAT THAT

00:59:07.176 --> 00:59:08.378
DOES TO THEIR OVERALL QUALITY

00:59:08.444 --> 00:59:09.779
OF LIFE. AND WHAT DOES THAT

00:59:09.846 --> 00:59:11.748
COST US IN THE LONG RUN WHEN

00:59:11.814 --> 00:59:12.982
SOMEBODY YOU KNOW MAKES A

00:59:13.049 --> 00:59:14.450
DECISION BECAUSE THEY YOU KNOW

00:59:14.517 --> 00:59:16.185
MAYBE THEY CAN'T BUY WASHER.

00:59:16.252 --> 00:59:17.987
AND THEY AND THEY HAVE TO WALK

00:59:18.054 --> 00:59:20.089
YOU KNOW TO A LAUNDROMAT OR

00:59:20.156 --> 00:59:21.424
WHAT IF YOU KNOW WHAT IF THEY

00:59:21.491 --> 00:59:23.226
HAVE THEIR EATING. LESS HEALTHY

00:59:23.293 --> 00:59:24.827
FOODS AND THEN THAT THEY END UP

00:59:24.894 --> 00:59:27.397
BEING. HAVING MORE- NEEDS YOU

00:59:27.463 --> 00:59:28.464
KNOW AS FAR AS HEALTH CARE

00:59:28.531 --> 00:59:31.267
NEEDS AND SO. IT YOU KNOW. I

00:59:31.334 --> 00:59:32.168
SAY THIS ALL THE TIME AND

00:59:32.235 --> 00:59:33.703
SOMETIMES I FEEL LIKE WE'RE

00:59:33.770 --> 00:59:34.270
REALLY PENNY WISE AND POUND

00:59:34.337 --> 00:59:36.172
FOOLISH HERE- BECAUSE WE ARE

00:59:36.239 --> 00:59:38.374
TALKING ABOUT A QUALITY OF LIFE

00:59:38.441 --> 00:59:41.010
AND- AND IT IS. ALSO DIFFICLT

00:59:41.077 --> 00:59:43.680
I THINK TO- PUT A PUT A NUMBER

00:59:43.746 --> 00:59:46.249
OR GET A HANDLE ON. ON WHAT-

00:59:46.316 --> 00:59:48.851
THE EFFECTS OF LEAVING THIS

00:59:48.918 --> 00:59:51.988
POLICY IN PLACE IS- BUT IT

00:59:52.055 --> 00:59:53.156
CAN'T BE POSITIVE FOR THOSE

00:59:53.222 --> 00:59:54.924
PEOPLE WHO WHO ARE WHO ARE

00:59:54.991 --> 00:59:57.260
STUCK HERE AND- IT'S HARD

00:59:57.327 --> 00:59:59.996

01:00:00.063 --> 01:00:02.031
IT'S EVEN HARDER TO- HE TOLD

01:00:02.098 --> 01:00:03.299
YOU GOTTA SPEND DOWN AND BE

01:00:03.366 --> 01:00:05.001
POORER. AND CAN'T TAKE CARE OF

WHILE POTENTIAL. CHAIRPERSON

THE IT WOULD TAKE A TIME IN

PART OF THE IS YOU PRIOR TO

01:01:09.532 --> 01:01:12.935
PANDA MY- WAS THAT THERE WAS

01:01:13.002 --> 01:01:15.671
ALREADY DELAYS IN ELIGIBILITY

01:01:15.738 --> 01:01:16.906
WITH ALL OF THEIR- BE

01:01:16.973 --> 01:01:17.940
DETERMINATIONS THAT ARE

01:01:18.007 --> 01:01:20.143
REQUIRED UNDER THE ACA SOME OF

01:01:20.209 --> 01:01:21.511
THAT HAD TAKEN QUITE SOME TIME

01:01:21.577 --> 01:01:22.979
THERE WAS SOME LITIGATION ABOUT

01:01:23.046 --> 01:01:26.549
IT- THAT WAS- DETERMINED I

01:01:26.616 --> 01:01:28.017
THINK OF THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME

01:01:28.084 --> 01:01:30.286
COURT LEVEL- JUST LAST YEAR. IS

01:01:30.353 --> 01:01:32.555
THERE HAVE BEEN DELAYS- AND A

01:01:32.622 --> 01:01:34.357
BIG PART OF THOSE DELAYS IS

01:01:34.424 --> 01:01:36.059
FIGURING OUT ALL THE THINGS YOU

01:01:36.125 --> 01:01:37.727
NEED TO DO IN ORDER TO CONFIRM

01:01:37.794 --> 01:01:39.028
ELIGIBILITY AND MY

01:01:39.095 --> 01:01:40.563
UNDERSTANDING IS A SIGNIFICANT

01:01:40.630 --> 01:01:43.666
PART OF THAT IS DETERMINING THE

01:01:43.733 --> 01:01:45.535
ASSETS. WHO THANK YOU MISSY AND

01:01:45.601 --> 01:01:49.005
THEN ON IN TERMS OF THE ASSET

01:01:49.072 --> 01:01:51.007
TEST IS THE ONLY REASON TO HAVE

01:01:51.074 --> 01:01:53.042
AN ACID TEST JUST TO. KEEP

01:01:53.109 --> 01:01:54.911
COSTS LOWER WERE THERE ANY

01:01:54.977 --> 01:02:00.016
OTHER REASON. TO HAVE AN ASSET

01:02:00.083 --> 01:02:01.818
TEST. WELL I THINK YOU HAVE THE

01:02:01.884 --> 01:02:02.552
SIDE THIS YOU HAVE IN. WHO HAVE

01:02:02.618 --> 01:02:04.654
NO INCOME. AND MAY HAVE ON THE

01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:06.589
DOLLAR AND SAVE AND THAT THAT I

01:02:06.656 --> 01:02:07.890
THINK IN THEIR SOME. CONCERN

01:02:07.957 --> 01:02:09.725
ESPECIALLY IF YOU LOOK AT THE

01:02:09.792 --> 01:02:11.727
ORIGINS OF THE PROGRAM IT WAS

01:02:11.794 --> 01:02:13.696
REALLY INTENDED TO ONLY COVER

01:02:13.763 --> 01:02:16.199
THOSE WHO WERE SORT OF THE

01:02:16.265 --> 01:02:18.301
NEEDIEST MODE. ALL WITHIN OUR

01:02:18.367 --> 01:02:20.703
POPULATIONS I THINK THE PROGRAM

01:02:20.770 --> 01:02:22.538
HAS EVOLVED A LOT SINCE. ON

01:02:22.605 --> 01:02:24.273
NUMBER ONE YOU DON'T SEE I

01:02:24.340 --> 01:02:24.974
DOUBT YOU'RE SEEING

01:02:25.041 --> 01:02:27.110
MILLIONAIRES APPLIED FOR MEDIC

01:02:27.176 --> 01:02:28.978
CAL. BUT BEYOND THAT I THINK

01:02:29.045 --> 01:02:31.414
THAT- YOU KNOW THE PROGRAM HAS

01:02:31.481 --> 01:02:33.082
EVOLVED TO BECOME SORT OF A

01:02:33.149 --> 01:02:35.551
BROADER SAFETY NET IN AND- YOU

01:02:35.618 --> 01:02:36.652
KNOW THE YOU'VE SEEN THE POLICY

01:02:36.719 --> 01:02:39.455
CHANGE. FOR THE FAMILIES AND

01:02:39.522 --> 01:02:42.825
FOR THE CHILDLESS ADULTS AND TO

01:02:42.892 --> 01:02:43.993
MOVE TO A MATCH I STANDARD AND

01:02:44.060 --> 01:02:45.061
SO WHAT WE'RE REALLY LOOKING AT

01:02:45.128 --> 01:02:46.696
IS INCOME AND WE'RE NOT LOOKING

01:02:46.762 --> 01:02:47.997
AT ASSETS. IT'S ONLY FOR THE

01:02:48.064 --> 01:02:48.798
SENIORS AND PEOPLE WITH

01:02:48.865 --> 01:02:50.299
DISABILITIES THAT WE'RE SORT OF

01:02:50.366 --> 01:02:52.101
STILL LIFE WITH THIS RELIC OF

01:02:52.168 --> 01:02:55.037
THE RECORDS OF THE PROGRAM. IN

01:02:55.104 --> 01:02:56.839
IN THE BASED ON YOUR EXPERIENCE

01:02:56.906 --> 01:02:58.708
WITH OTHER STATES AS OTHER

01:02:58.774 --> 01:03:01.077
STATES HAVE LIFTED THAT ASSET

01:03:01.144 --> 01:03:03.880
TASK NUMBER OR GOTTEN RID OF.

01:03:03.946 --> 01:03:05.615
THE ASSET TEST HAVE YOU SEEN

01:03:05.681 --> 01:03:12.421
THEM. A SIGNIFICANT SPIKE IN.

01:03:12.488 --> 01:03:14.157
ENROLLMENT BECAUSE- FROM THE

01:03:14.223 --> 01:03:15.024
REPORTS THAT I REVIEW IT LIKE

01:03:15.091 --> 01:03:16.926
THERE'S- A- NUMBER. BY IT HAS

01:03:16.993 --> 01:03:18.828
BEEN CRUSHING AMOUNT OF ROOM

01:03:18.895 --> 01:03:20.329
ANYTHING WHAT WE SEE IN THE DH

01:03:20.396 --> 01:03:23.466
CS REPORTED IT SIMILAR. THERE

01:03:23.533 --> 01:03:25.535
WOULD AS WE THAT THERE WOULD A

01:03:25.601 --> 01:03:26.669
MY NUMBER OF IN THE- WHO WOULD

01:03:26.736 --> 01:03:28.371
BE. ELLA BUT A LOT OF THOSE

01:03:28.437 --> 01:03:29.972
INDIVIDUALS WOULD HAVE BECOME

01:03:30.039 --> 01:03:31.707
ELIGIBLE ONE WAY OR ANOTHER

01:03:31.774 --> 01:03:32.608
RIGHT I THINK I THINK THAT'S

01:03:32.675 --> 01:03:33.843
YOUR POINT REALLY WELL TAKEN

01:03:33.910 --> 01:03:38.214
WHICH IS. THAT WE KNOW- YOU

01:03:38.281 --> 01:03:38.881
KNOW WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE

01:03:38.948 --> 01:03:40.516
LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN

01:03:40.583 --> 01:03:44.954
POVERTY IN CALIFORNIA. AND-

01:03:45.021 --> 01:03:48.424
USING YOUR ARBITRARY A

01:03:48.491 --> 01:03:50.726
DIFFERENT LOOK VERY THAT LEGAL

01:03:50.793 --> 01:03:53.029
WAYS TO DETERMINE WHO THEY ARE

01:03:53.095 --> 01:03:54.497
JUST MAKES IT MORE DIFFICULT

01:03:54.564 --> 01:03:57.033
FOR THEM TO GET THE ENTITLEMENT

01:03:57.099 --> 01:03:59.168
THAT WE'VE TRYING TO. GET THEM

01:03:59.235 --> 01:04:02.238
THE HELP THAT THEY NEED SO. ON

01:04:02.305 --> 01:04:05.441
D. YOU KNOW IF YOU WERE

01:04:05.508 --> 01:04:09.378
ADVISING US- HOW I GUESS HOW WE

01:04:09.445 --> 01:04:10.880
KNOW WHAT KIND OF TEST WOULD

01:04:10.947 --> 01:04:11.981
YOU HAVE WOULD YOU JUST

01:04:12.048 --> 01:04:13.783
RECOMMEND GETTING RID OF THE

01:04:13.849 --> 01:04:16.953
ASSET TEST AND TYRA. LET ME

01:04:17.019 --> 01:04:19.021
SPEAK FIRST TO THE FIRST POINT

01:04:19.088 --> 01:04:20.489
YOU MADE IS THAT I DO THINK

01:04:20.556 --> 01:04:21.891
THAT THE WITH THE ASSET TYPES

01:04:21.958 --> 01:04:23.993
THERE'S A CHILLING EFFECT. AND

01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:26.162
SO THERE MAY BE INDIVIDUALS WHO

01:04:26.229 --> 01:04:29.398
ARE ELIGIBLE BUT WHO ARE AFRAID

01:04:29.465 --> 01:04:31.901
TO APPLY TO BE IN BECAUSE THEY

01:04:31.968 --> 01:04:33.336
ARE AFRAID THAT YOU KNOW MAYBE

01:04:33.402 --> 01:04:34.303
THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND EXACTLY

01:04:34.370 --> 01:04:35.404
HOW THE RULES WERE THE RULES

01:04:35.471 --> 01:04:37.473
ARE VERY COMPLICATED. AND SO

01:04:37.540 --> 01:04:38.908
THEY THINK THAT THEY MAY NOT BE

01:04:38.975 --> 01:04:40.243
ELIGIBLE EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE

01:04:40.309 --> 01:04:41.611
SO I THINK THAT'S NUMBER ONE IS

01:04:41.677 --> 01:04:42.945
THAT YOU HAVE INDIVIDUALS.

01:04:43.012 --> 01:04:44.280
COULD QUALIFY EVEN UNDER OUR

01:04:44.347 --> 01:04:46.349
CURRENT RULES THE BECAUSE OF

01:04:46.415 --> 01:04:49.051
THIS THAT OF THIS FEAR OR WITH

01:04:49.118 --> 01:04:50.886
THIS CONCERN OF OPENING THE

01:04:50.953 --> 01:04:52.121
BOOKS EVERYBODY THAT THEY DON'T

01:04:52.188 --> 01:04:54.290
WANT TO APPLY AND I THINK. THAT

01:04:54.357 --> 01:04:56.259
IS A GROUP OF FOLKS WHERE BEING

01:04:56.325 --> 01:04:59.228
ABLE TO MODIFY HOW WE HANDLE

01:04:59.295 --> 01:05:01.430
THINGS. WE'D ENCOURAGE THEM TO

01:05:01.497 --> 01:05:03.266
GET THE HELP THAT'S AVAILABLE

01:05:03.332 --> 01:05:03.866
TO THEM SO THAT'S THAT'S THE

01:05:03.933 --> 01:05:05.701
FIRST POINT. THE SECOND I KNOW

01:05:05.768 --> 01:05:07.036
THAT THERE ARE A FEW DIFFERENT

01:05:07.103 --> 01:05:09.572
AREAS THAT ARE BEING LOOKED AT-

01:05:09.639 --> 01:05:11.941
I THINK THAT IN TERMS OF.

01:05:12.008 --> 01:05:15.244
ADMINISTRATIVE IT. DIFFICULTY

01:05:15.311 --> 01:05:17.780
IN IANS. I IMPLEMENTING

01:05:17.847 --> 01:05:19.715
ADDITIONAL EXEMPTIONS TO THE

01:05:19.782 --> 01:05:21.617
ASSET TEST PROBABLY DOESN'T GET

01:05:21.684 --> 01:05:23.185
YOU THAT MUCH I MEAN YOU WILL

01:05:23.252 --> 01:05:24.387
HAVE MORE INDIVIDUALS WHO

01:05:24.453 --> 01:05:26.122
BECOME ELIGIBLE BUT YOU'RE

01:05:26.188 --> 01:05:27.056
STILL GOING TO BE NEEDING TO GO

01:05:27.123 --> 01:05:29.091
THROUGH ALL OF THEIR- STUFF. I

01:05:29.158 --> 01:05:30.693
OLDER INFORMATION IN ORDER TO

01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:32.662
DETERMINE ELIGIBILITY-

01:05:32.728 --> 01:05:35.464
INCREASING THE ASSET TEST

01:05:35.531 --> 01:05:36.932
ESPECIALLY FOR WE'RE LOOKING AT

01:05:36.999 --> 01:05:38.134
YOU KNOW SORT OF WHAT MAIN HAS

01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:40.303
DONE OR NEW YORK IS DONE. THEN

01:05:40.369 --> 01:05:45.141
YOU'RE LOOKING. AT CERTAIN.

01:05:45.207 --> 01:05:47.109
MAKING THE RULES A LOT MORE. SO

01:05:47.176 --> 01:05:47.710
THAT THERE CAN BE A RAINY DAY

01:05:47.777 --> 01:05:49.412
FUN YOU CREATE A- FOR THE TOO.

01:05:49.478 --> 01:05:52.515
OVER TO. BASED ON SORT OF

01:05:52.581 --> 01:05:53.983
INFLATION. AND THE CERTAINLY

01:05:54.050 --> 01:05:54.750
MAKES IT A MORE HE- POLICY

01:05:54.817 --> 01:05:55.785
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO. AGAIN

01:05:55.851 --> 01:05:56.919
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET AS MUCH

01:05:56.986 --> 01:05:58.020
IN TERMS OF ADMINISTRATIVE

01:05:58.087 --> 01:05:59.488
SAVINGS THE ONLY PLACE WHERE

01:05:59.555 --> 01:06:00.923
CAN YOU GET RID SIGNIFICANT

01:06:00.990 --> 01:06:02.925
ADMINISTRATIVE SAVINGS. IS

01:06:02.992 --> 01:06:05.027
WHERE YOU GET RID OF THE ACID

01:06:05.094 --> 01:06:07.396
TEST ALL ELIMINATED ALTOGETHER.

01:06:07.463 --> 01:06:08.998
ALL IN THE AREA WHERE I SEE

01:06:09.065 --> 01:06:09.965
THAT THAT'S PROBABLY THE

01:06:10.032 --> 01:06:11.600
EASIEST IS FOR THE MEDICARE

01:06:11.667 --> 01:06:14.003
SAVINGS PROGRAM. AND FOR A LOT

01:06:14.070 --> 01:06:16.806
OF THESE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE

01:06:16.872 --> 01:06:17.573
ASSETS ASKING. A LOT OF THEM

01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:19.208
ARE IN THE M. S. P. PROGRAMS

01:06:19.275 --> 01:06:20.509
BECAUSE THEY'VE DONE THE WORK

01:06:20.576 --> 01:06:21.677
THEY'VE DONE THEIR FORTY

01:06:21.744 --> 01:06:22.712
QUARTERS OF POOR THING. A

01:06:22.778 --> 01:06:25.047
THEY'VE GOTTEN ALL OF THEIR-

01:06:25.114 --> 01:06:26.215
THEY QUALIFY FOR MEDICARE

01:06:26.282 --> 01:06:27.616
BENEFITS AND SO FOR THOSE

01:06:27.683 --> 01:06:28.951
INDIVIDUALS WHAT THEY'RE DOING

01:06:29.018 --> 01:06:30.720
IS WE'RE LOOKING AT JUST

01:06:30.786 --> 01:06:31.954
SUPPLEMENTING THE MEDICARE

01:06:32.021 --> 01:06:33.856
PROGRAM. SO THAT'S AN EASY

01:06:33.923 --> 01:06:36.292
PLACE WHERE WE CAN GET A

01:06:36.359 --> 01:06:38.527
NOMINATION OF THE ASSET TEST.

01:06:38.594 --> 01:06:40.096
WITHOUT IT I AND I THINK IT

01:06:40.162 --> 01:06:41.931
WOULDN'T HAVE NEARLY AS MUCH IT

01:06:41.997 --> 01:06:43.099
WOULD PROVIDE THE

01:06:43.165 --> 01:06:44.800
ADMINISTRATIVE SAVINGS. BUT

01:06:44.867 --> 01:06:47.870
PROBABLY MARTIN MORE MODEST-

01:06:47.937 --> 01:06:49.972
COST IN TERMS BENEFITS WHAT THE

01:06:50.039 --> 01:06:51.273
WHOLE POINT ABOUT HAVING

01:06:51.340 --> 01:06:51.974
INSURANCE IS TO INCREASE THE

01:06:52.041 --> 01:06:53.442
POOL SO OBVIOUSLY THE MORE

01:06:53.509 --> 01:06:54.076
PEOPLE YOU HAVE IN THE

01:06:54.143 --> 01:06:55.811
INSURANCE POOL THE CHEAPER THE

01:06:55.878 --> 01:06:58.214
COST FOR THE ENTIRE- INSURANCE

01:06:58.280 --> 01:06:59.982
SO IT SEEMS THATBASED ON YOUR

01:07:00.049 --> 01:07:01.450
EXPERIENCE EVEN IF WE GOT RID

01:07:01.517 --> 01:07:04.854
OF THE ASSET TEST AND EVEN IF.

01:07:04.920 --> 01:07:07.356
PEOPLE SLOWLY- WERE ABLE TO

01:07:07.423 --> 01:07:09.291
COME ONTO THE MEDICAID ROLLS

01:07:09.358 --> 01:07:10.192
WHICH ACTUALLY WOULD BE A GOAL

01:07:10.259 --> 01:07:11.927
OF OURS. WE WOULDN'T

01:07:11.994 --> 01:07:14.730
NECESSARILY SEE. A COMPLETE-

01:07:14.797 --> 01:07:16.565
YOU A ONE FOR ONE ADDITION OF

01:07:16.632 --> 01:07:17.867
COSTS THAT AN THAT THERE WOULD

01:07:17.933 --> 01:07:18.868
BE SOME COST SAVINGS AND

01:07:18.934 --> 01:07:19.769
OBVIOUSLY THIS ADMINISTRATIVE

01:07:19.835 --> 01:07:21.570
SAVINGS SO WE ACTUALLY DON'T.

01:07:21.637 --> 01:07:23.672
EXACTLY KNOW HOW MUCH IT WOULD

01:07:23.739 --> 01:07:26.041
COST AND- OBVIOUSLY- AND LAST

01:07:26.108 --> 01:07:27.510
YEAR IN BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE WE

01:07:27.576 --> 01:07:28.577
HAD WE HAD SOME PRETTY

01:07:28.644 --> 01:07:30.312
SIGNIFICANT DISAGREEMENTS WITH

01:07:30.379 --> 01:07:32.148
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE OVER.

01:07:32.214 --> 01:07:33.382
THERE ARE YOU KNOW PRETTY

01:07:33.449 --> 01:07:34.884
INFLATED COST ESTIMATES SINCE I

01:07:34.950 --> 01:07:36.218
THINK THIS. I THINK THIS

01:07:36.285 --> 01:07:38.154
HEARING SEX EXTREMELY HELPFUL

01:07:38.220 --> 01:07:40.823
TO REALLY. ON SORT OF IDENTIFY.

01:07:40.890 --> 01:07:42.091
SOME OF THOSE ISSUES AND WE

01:07:42.158 --> 01:07:45.227
REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR-

01:07:45.294 --> 01:07:45.795
THOUGHTFULNESS AND ANALYSIS

01:07:45.861 --> 01:07:47.329
THANK YOU. THANK YOU WHAT IF I

01:07:47.396 --> 01:07:48.964
MIGHT THAT REMINDS ME OF

01:07:49.031 --> 01:07:50.533
SOMETHING THAT TROOPERS WOULD

01:07:50.599 --> 01:07:53.002
MENTION IS THAT YOU KNOW. FOR

01:07:53.068 --> 01:07:54.770
THIS POPULATION THERE'S ALSO

01:07:54.837 --> 01:07:57.239
THERE'S THE INSURANCE ASPECT

01:07:57.306 --> 01:07:59.275
THAT YOU JUST MENTIONED AND- IN

01:07:59.341 --> 01:08:00.643
TERMS OF THE WHOLE MEDICAL

01:08:00.709 --> 01:08:02.478
POPULATION SENIOR SOME PEOPLE

01:08:02.545 --> 01:08:04.580
DISABILITIES DO TEND TO HAVE

01:08:04.647 --> 01:08:06.449
HIGHER COSTS BECAUSE OF YOU

01:08:06.515 --> 01:08:09.351
KNOW. OF THAT THEIR DEMOGRAPHIC

01:08:09.418 --> 01:08:11.787
THAT BEING SAID- FOR THIS

01:08:11.854 --> 01:08:13.889
POPULATION IF THEY WERE BECOME

01:08:13.956 --> 01:08:16.992
TO BECOME ELIGIBLE FOR EARLIER.

01:08:17.059 --> 01:08:19.128
THEY MAY BE ABLE TO. HAVE

01:08:19.195 --> 01:08:20.863
ACCESS TO ADDITIONAL OF

01:08:20.930 --> 01:08:22.698
PREVENTIVE SERVICES IN THE END

01:08:22.765 --> 01:08:23.666
I WAS THINKING ABOUT YOU KNOW

01:08:23.732 --> 01:08:25.067
RIGHT NOW OF WHETHER OR NOT

01:08:25.134 --> 01:08:27.136
THEY MAY HAVE RAINY DAY FUND

01:08:27.203 --> 01:08:28.471
MIGHT IMPACT WHETHER OR NOT

01:08:28.537 --> 01:08:29.872
WHAT KINDS OF MASKS THEY CAN

01:08:29.939 --> 01:08:31.507
BUY. WHICH WOULD REALLY BE

01:08:31.574 --> 01:08:32.842
SOMETHING THAT PROTECTS THE

01:08:32.908 --> 01:08:34.310
THEIR HEALTH IN THE FUTURE WELL

01:08:34.376 --> 01:08:36.378
WE HAVEN'T LOOKED AT IT ALL IS

01:08:36.445 --> 01:08:38.481
THE IMPACT OF BEING ABLE TO

01:08:38.547 --> 01:08:40.182
HAVE YOUR RECORD NEED TO

01:08:40.249 --> 01:08:41.750
PREVENTIVE CARE THIS ONE OF THE

01:08:41.817 --> 01:08:42.418
THINGS THAT MEDICARE DOES

01:08:42.485 --> 01:08:43.719
REQUIRE OF THE MANAGED CARE

01:08:43.786 --> 01:08:45.187
PLANS. IS TO PROVIDE

01:08:45.254 --> 01:08:46.589
COORDINATED CARE FOR

01:08:46.655 --> 01:08:48.757
INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE ELDERLY OR

01:08:48.824 --> 01:08:50.326
WITH DISABILITIES AND THEY

01:08:50.392 --> 01:08:51.760
WOULD HAVE ACCESS TO THAT SO

01:08:51.827 --> 01:08:53.462
THEY WOULD HAVE. ANNUAL

01:08:53.529 --> 01:08:54.997
CHECKUPS AND THEY WOULD BE ABLE

01:08:55.064 --> 01:08:56.232
TO GET YOU KNOW THEIR IF THE IF

01:08:56.298 --> 01:08:57.633
THEY HAVE DIABETES TO BE ABLE

01:08:57.700 --> 01:08:59.568
TO GET THAT UNDER CONTROL SO

01:08:59.635 --> 01:09:01.270
THAT FROM THE LONG RUN. WE

01:09:01.337 --> 01:09:02.638
MIGHT BE LOOKING AT ADDITIONAL

01:09:02.705 --> 01:09:03.806
SAVINGS FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE

01:09:03.873 --> 01:09:08.711
BUT THOSE. ARE VERY DIFFICULT

01:09:08.777 --> 01:09:10.913
TO QUANTIFY. THANK YOU VERY

01:09:12.548 --> 01:09:13.816
ARE PRIMARY DIFFICULT TO

01:09:13.883 --> 01:09:15.351
QUANTIFY IT BUT I THINK THE

01:09:15.417 --> 01:09:15.885
REAL. AND I THINK THEY'RE

01:09:15.951 --> 01:09:18.320
IMPORTANT. AND I THINK IT'S A

01:09:18.387 --> 01:09:19.021
STATEMENT OF OUR VALUES HERE

OUT OF THE ASSET TEST

01:11:15.204 --> 01:11:17.239
REQUIREMENTS BY THE ACA WERE

01:11:17.306 --> 01:11:18.974
THE PARENTS OF CHILDREN.

01:11:19.041 --> 01:11:20.542
REMEMBER CHILDREN LARGELY COULD

01:11:20.609 --> 01:11:22.578
NOT HAVE ASKED THAT PASSED BY

01:11:22.645 --> 01:11:23.278
THE TIME WE IMPLEMENTED THE

01:11:23.345 --> 01:11:25.547
ACA- AND THERE ARE STILL THE

01:11:25.614 --> 01:11:26.749
LARGEST GROUP OF ENROLLEES IN

01:11:26.815 --> 01:11:29.284
THE PROGRAM. AS WELL AS ADULTS

01:11:29.351 --> 01:11:30.953
WITHOUT CHILDREN IN WITHOUT

01:11:31.020 --> 01:11:33.322
DISABILITIES WHO PREVIOUSLY DID

01:11:33.389 --> 01:11:34.390
NOT QUALIFY AT ALL FOR MEDIC

01:11:34.456 --> 01:11:39.328

OPTIONAL EXPANSION GROUP. SO M.

01:11:40.129 --> 01:11:41.163

AND JUSTIN ALL TYPES PROPERTY

01:11:43.198 --> 01:11:44.800
OR ASSETS. OR OUTRIGHT

01:11:44.867 --> 01:11:46.235
ELIMINATE THE TEST FOR THOSE

01:11:46.301 --> 01:11:49.004
WHO WE- ANY PERSON APPLYING AS

01:11:49.071 --> 01:11:51.040
NOTED BY MIZZI STILL NEED TO

01:11:51.106 --> 01:11:51.840
MEET THE INCOME TAX. WE'RE

01:11:51.907 --> 01:11:54.309
GOING OF WHATEVER. THEY MAY

01:11:54.376 --> 01:11:55.511
RETAIN. AT THIS TIME I DID WANT

01:11:55.577 --> 01:11:56.945
TO REMIND EVERYONE THAT WE DID

01:11:57.012 --> 01:11:58.881
GET TO ONE HUNDRED AND 38% OF

01:11:58.947 --> 01:12:00.482
THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL THAT

01:12:00.549 --> 01:12:02.384
WAS AN EXPANSION- REALLY

01:12:02.451 --> 01:12:04.086
CHAMPION BY THE LEGISLATURE

01:12:04.153 --> 01:12:04.787
AGREED TO BY THE

01:12:04.853 --> 01:12:07.189
ADMINISTRATION. AND AS A

01:12:07.256 --> 01:12:08.991
REMINDER FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE

01:12:09.058 --> 01:12:09.958
THAT MEANS THE HOUSEHOLD OF ONE

01:12:10.025 --> 01:12:11.994
PERSON. FOR THEIR INCOME CAN

01:12:12.061 --> 01:12:14.863
HAVE UP TO SEVENTEEN THOUSAND

01:12:14.930 --> 01:12:15.831
SIX HUNDRED AND NINE DOLLARS SO

01:12:15.898 --> 01:12:17.399
THAT'S WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW

01:12:17.466 --> 01:12:18.901
FOR ELIGIBILITY FOR AGED BLIND

01:12:18.967 --> 01:12:20.335
AND DISABLED INDIVIDUALS WHO

01:12:20.402 --> 01:12:21.870
ARE IN THAT'S NOT MATCH AYE.

01:12:21.937 --> 01:12:24.506
CATEGORY AYE I WILL SAY AS AN

01:12:24.573 --> 01:12:25.941
ASIDE I THINK THE PERSON WHO

01:12:26.008 --> 01:12:26.809
HAS A MILLION DOLLARS IN

01:12:26.875 --> 01:12:29.411
SAVINGS. AND NO INCOME AND ALSO

01:12:29.478 --> 01:12:31.213
NO EXISTING HEALTH COVERAGE AND

01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:32.214
WANTS TO GET THEIR HEALTHCARE

01:12:32.281 --> 01:12:32.815
THROUGH MEDICARE ALL IS A BIT

01:12:32.881 --> 01:12:34.717
OF A UNICORN. SO I DO THINK

01:12:34.783 --> 01:12:36.919
THAT EXTREME SORT OF EXAMPLE OF

01:12:36.985 --> 01:12:38.153
WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN IF THE ASSET

01:12:38.220 --> 01:12:40.089
TESTS WERE ELIMINATED. ISRAELI

01:12:40.155 --> 01:12:41.890
NOT A COMMON OCCURRENCE OF AN

01:12:41.957 --> 01:12:43.492
OCCURRENCE AT ALL AND SO

01:12:43.559 --> 01:12:45.094
DISCUSS AN ACID TEST PERHAPS

01:12:45.160 --> 01:12:47.062
MORE IN ITS MERITS AND WITH

01:12:47.129 --> 01:12:48.397
THE- DISCUSSION AS YOU WERE

01:12:48.464 --> 01:12:50.866
NOTING- MISTER- BOTH OF THE

01:12:50.933 --> 01:12:53.202
CHAIRS- AS WELL AS- ASSEMBLY

01:12:53.268 --> 01:12:55.104
MEMBER CHIANG- AND THINKING

01:12:55.170 --> 01:12:56.605
ABOUT SORT OF OUR VALUES AND

01:12:56.672 --> 01:12:57.506
WHAT IT MEANS TO ELIMINATE THE

01:12:57.573 --> 01:12:59.441
ASSET TEST. AND ALLOW MORE

01:12:59.508 --> 01:13:01.143
INDIVIDUALS INTO HEALTH

01:13:01.210 --> 01:13:02.244
COVERAGE WITHOUT THAT TASK.

01:13:02.311 --> 01:13:08.884
SEEMS TO BE A REALLY. GOOD

01:13:08.951 --> 01:13:10.152
FOCUS FOR THE CONVERSATION.

01:13:10.219 --> 01:13:11.286
THAT STAFF IMPACT INCLINE

01:13:11.353 --> 01:13:13.155
IMPACT THE HALF TEST FOR THOSE

01:13:13.222 --> 01:13:16.091
THAT IT DOES STILL APPLY TO ITS-

01:13:16.158 --> 01:13:17.893
FACETS. OF A DEAL INVOLVED IN.

01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:19.795
WORK ON THE- OF OUR STAFF. TO

01:13:19.862 --> 01:13:22.331
CHASE PAPER. ENTERCOM CLIENTS

01:13:22.397 --> 01:13:23.832
MORE OPTIMAL TO TIMES. THAT

01:13:23.899 --> 01:13:25.167
HAVE TO CONFUSING. IT NEEDS TO

01:13:25.234 --> 01:13:26.468
BE X. TO MY APPLICANTS AND RISK.

01:13:26.535 --> 01:13:27.903
BE THEY'VE NOT BEEN SUBBED TO

01:13:27.970 --> 01:13:30.472
IT- IF FOR EXAMPLE THOSE WHO BE.

01:13:30.539 --> 01:13:32.274
PREVIOUSLY ELIGIBLE THE MATCH I

01:13:32.341 --> 01:13:34.610
RULES AND HAVE NOW LOST THAT

01:13:34.676 --> 01:13:36.445
COVERAGE WE DO LOOK TO SEE IF

01:13:36.512 --> 01:13:38.013
THEY MAY BE ELIGIBLE UNDER NON

01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:40.215
MATCH AYE. AND THAT ENTAILS AS

01:13:40.282 --> 01:13:41.583
I'LL GET INTO IN THE SECOND.

01:13:41.650 --> 01:13:43.285
SENDING THEM A BUNCH MORE PAPER

01:13:43.352 --> 01:13:44.486
AND SAYING PLEASE THESE OUT AND

01:13:44.553 --> 01:13:46.622
SEND ALL THE VERY. AND THAT CAN

01:13:46.688 --> 01:13:48.724
BE VERY CONFUSING TO THEM. SO

01:13:48.791 --> 01:13:50.592
WE DO HAVE A SITUATION AS

01:13:50.659 --> 01:13:51.393
YOU'LL SEE I THINK IN THE

01:13:51.460 --> 01:13:53.662
BRIEFING PAPER. AND IT'S A

01:13:53.729 --> 01:13:54.496
GERMAN NAME ALL OF FROM THE HVS

01:13:54.563 --> 01:13:56.265
WILL NOTE. WHERE PEOPLE GET

01:13:56.331 --> 01:13:57.933
THIS. AND THEN THEY JUST NEVER

01:13:58.000 --> 01:13:59.868
EVEN RESPOND. AND SO THEY DON'T

01:13:59.935 --> 01:14:01.136
REALLY GET THE CHANCE TO

01:14:01.203 --> 01:14:02.237
COMPLETE THAT THE SORT OF IDEA

01:14:02.304 --> 01:14:03.806
FAILING TO PROVIDE THE

01:14:03.872 --> 01:14:05.541
INFORMATION THAT IS NEEDED AND-

01:14:05.607 --> 01:14:07.543
WE MAKE THEM- I'M- INELIGIBLE

01:14:07.609 --> 01:14:09.378
OR POTENTIALLY. MOVE THEM INTO

01:14:09.444 --> 01:14:10.779
THE COVER CALIFORNIA BASED

01:14:10.846 --> 01:14:12.347
COVERAGE WHERE THEY MAY HAVE A

01:14:12.414 --> 01:14:13.549
COST THAT IS GREATER THAN THEY

01:14:13.615 --> 01:14:15.217
WOULD HAVE. IF WE COULD HAVE

01:14:15.284 --> 01:14:16.752
DONE THAT ASSET CLASS WITH THEM

01:14:16.819 --> 01:14:23.692
AND FOUND THEM ELIGIBLE. ON AN.

01:14:23.759 --> 01:14:25.427
ONGOING BASIS- THERE IS ALSO A

01:14:25.494 --> 01:14:26.562
TWO EFFECT. FOR THE WHO MAKE.

01:14:26.628 --> 01:14:28.330
OF EITHER IN THE FIRST PLACE OR-

01:14:28.397 --> 01:14:29.231
IF THEY ARE FOR EXAMPLE MOVING.

01:14:29.298 --> 01:14:30.866
MATCH I. COVER ON ARTS. IN

01:14:30.933 --> 01:14:32.434
ORDER TO SEE IF YOU'RE STILL

01:14:32.501 --> 01:14:34.436
ELIGIBLE HERE'S SOME PAPERWORK

01:14:34.503 --> 01:14:35.470
THAT YOU NEED TO FILL OUT AND

01:14:35.537 --> 01:14:37.005
WE NEED TO GET THESE- YOU KNOW

01:14:37.072 --> 01:14:38.740
DIFFERENT VERIFICATION. THERE

01:14:38.807 --> 01:14:39.908
ARE PEOPLE WHO MAY NOT EVEN

01:14:39.975 --> 01:14:41.543
APPLY OR WHO MAY JUST IGNORE

01:14:41.610 --> 01:14:42.845
ALL THE PAPERWORK. AND

01:14:42.911 --> 01:14:44.780
THEREFORE MISS OUT ON THIS

01:14:44.847 --> 01:14:45.614
COVERAGE THAT THEY COULD IN

01:14:45.681 --> 01:14:47.683
FACT BE ELIGIBLE FOR IF ONLY WE

01:14:47.749 --> 01:14:49.384
WERE TEN PART PROVIDE THAT. SO

01:14:49.451 --> 01:14:51.086
IN ADDITION TO THE LIMITS BEING

01:14:51.153 --> 01:14:53.388
LOW. AND IT APPLYING TO A LOT

01:14:53.455 --> 01:14:55.357
OF TYPES OF PROPERTY- SUCH AS

01:14:55.424 --> 01:14:57.826
JEWELRY BURIAL PLOTS TRUSTS AND

01:14:57.893 --> 01:14:59.928
THINGS LIKE THAT. YOU ALSO CAN

01:14:59.995 --> 01:15:01.563
SEE A SITUATION WHERE SOMEONE

01:15:01.630 --> 01:15:02.631
WHO MAY BE ELIGIBLE THIS

01:15:02.698 --> 01:15:04.299
DOESN'T EVEN BOTHER. AND SO I

01:15:04.366 --> 01:15:05.133
THINK YOU SORT OF HAVE TO

01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:06.768
GROUPS TO THINK ABOUT. THOSE

01:15:06.835 --> 01:15:09.004
WHO GET TOLD DURING THE PROCESS

01:15:09.071 --> 01:15:13.275
THAT THEY'RE NOT ELIGIBLE AS.

01:15:13.342 --> 01:15:13.842
WELL AS THOSE WHO JUST NEVER

01:15:13.909 --> 01:15:15.944
EVEN START. WELL IF WOMEN

01:15:16.011 --> 01:15:17.813
NEEDED- AS DISCUSSED I THINK IN

01:15:17.880 --> 01:15:19.214
THE PREVIOUS. COOPER THERE'S

01:15:19.281 --> 01:15:20.883
NOT A HUGE AMOUNT OF IN MINUTES.

01:15:20.949 --> 01:15:22.184
STATE THAT WHEN REALLY BE

01:15:22.251 --> 01:15:23.886
ACHIEVED IN THE SENSE OF. YOU

01:15:23.952 --> 01:15:25.454
KNOW WE CAN JUST CUT THE COUNTY

01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:27.856
STAFF. WHAT WE DO SEE IS THAT

01:15:27.923 --> 01:15:29.324
COUNTIES ALWAYS HAVE MORE WORK

01:15:29.391 --> 01:15:30.192
ON THEIR PLATE THEN THEY COULD

01:15:30.259 --> 01:15:31.827
DO IN ANY GIVEN DAY. SOMEONE'S

01:15:31.894 --> 01:15:33.328
PHONE CALL DOESN'T GET RETURNED

01:15:33.395 --> 01:15:34.496
ON THAT SAME DAY. AND

01:15:34.563 --> 01:15:36.131
INTERCOUNTY TRANSFER MAY NOT BE

01:15:36.198 --> 01:15:37.833
INITIATED ON THE DAY IN WHICH

01:15:37.900 --> 01:15:40.302
IS NEEDED. THERE ARE ODD.

01:15:40.369 --> 01:15:42.070
COVERAGE ARE THINGS THAT WE

01:15:42.137 --> 01:15:43.338
NEED TO TAKE CARE OF ALERTS

01:15:43.405 --> 01:15:45.207
FROM THE MEDICAL SYSTEM THAT WE

01:15:45.274 --> 01:15:46.942
NEED TO PROCESS. DEPRIVE MAJOR

01:15:47.009 --> 01:15:49.544
PEOPLE. MISS OUT ON COVERAGE.

01:15:49.611 --> 01:15:51.747
NOTHING DO WITH THE- BECAUSE WE

01:15:51.813 --> 01:15:52.514
CAN GET TO THEM ON THE SAME DAY

01:15:52.581 --> 01:15:54.449
SO WE WOULD BE. TO MORE. EASILY

01:15:54.516 --> 01:15:55.517

COMMON NOT MATCH I RELATED

01:18:58.767 --> 01:19:00.569
SITUATIONS THAT ASKS FOR THAT

01:19:00.635 --> 01:19:02.304
ADDITIONAL FOLLOW UP. SO THE

01:19:02.370 --> 01:19:04.039
FORM SOMEBODY GETS AND THEY'RE

01:19:04.106 --> 01:19:04.673
COMING IN BRAND NEW IS AN

01:19:04.739 --> 01:19:06.074
APPLICATION. OR IF THERE

01:19:06.141 --> 01:19:08.110
CHANGING FROM MAGIC COVERAGE

01:19:08.176 --> 01:19:10.078
INTO POTENTIALLY NON MAGIC OR

01:19:10.145 --> 01:19:11.213
THEN GOING TO GO TO COVER

01:19:11.279 --> 01:19:13.715
CALIFORNIA. FOR THAT COVERAGE

DEPENDING ON THE CIRCUMSTANCE

01:19:20.388 --> 01:19:21.957
BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS THE SAME

01:19:22.023 --> 01:19:23.225
THAT THEY STILL ASK FOR PEOPLE

01:19:23.291 --> 01:19:23.892

01:19:57.025 --> 01:19:57.993
THIS IS WHAT WE NEED TO BE ABLE

01:19:58.059 --> 01:19:59.427

01:23:23.098 --> 01:23:24.766
GOING IN LONG TERM CARE IF YOU

01:23:24.833 --> 01:23:26.835
ARE. POTENTIALLY A LONG TERM

01:23:26.901 --> 01:23:28.837
CARE RECIPIENT AND THAT IS- FOR

01:23:28.903 --> 01:23:32.307
THE NEXT THIRTY MONTHS THAT'S

01:23:32.374 --> 01:23:32.874
THREE ZERO THIRTY MONTHS WE

01:23:32.941 --> 01:23:34.609
WILL LOOK BACK AND SEE. DID YOU

01:23:34.676 --> 01:23:35.677
DO ANY OF THAT DID YOU GIVE

01:23:35.744 --> 01:23:37.879
AWAY SOMETHING DID YOU SELL OR

01:23:37.946 --> 01:23:39.914
GIVE AWAY PROPERTY OR HOUSE OR

01:23:39.981 --> 01:23:41.483
SOMETHING FOR LESS THAN IT'S

01:23:41.549 --> 01:23:43.118
REALLY VALUE THAT. AND IF

01:23:43.184 --> 01:23:44.452
THAT'S THE CASE THEN WE HAVE TO

01:23:44.519 --> 01:23:46.020
DO SOME CALCULATIONS AND IT

01:23:46.087 --> 01:23:47.756
COULD MAKE SOMEONE INELIGIBLE

01:23:47.822 --> 01:23:49.858
FOR LONG TERM CARE FOR A PERIOD

01:23:49.924 --> 01:23:51.192
OF UP TO THIRTY MONTHS AND IT'S

01:23:51.259 --> 01:23:53.661
BASED ON. HOW MUCH I GIVE AWAY

01:23:53.728 --> 01:23:55.630
AND HOW MUCH DOES THE- I CARE

01:23:55.697 --> 01:23:57.365
COST AND WE DO MATH TO FIGURE

01:23:57.432 --> 01:23:59.033
OUT HOW MANY MONTHS YOU'RE

01:23:59.100 --> 01:24:01.236
LOCKED OUT- I AGREE THAT LONG

01:24:01.302 --> 01:24:02.670
TERM CARE THOUGH IS SO PRICEY

01:24:02.737 --> 01:24:03.972
AND EXPENSIVE. THAT IT IS

01:24:04.038 --> 01:24:13.047
DIFFICULT TO DO THINK ABOUT- I

01:24:13.114 --> 01:24:14.382
GETTING TO A POINT IN A LOT OF.

01:24:14.449 --> 01:24:18.119
WHERE COST WOULD. BE I.

01:24:18.186 --> 01:24:18.753
SOMETHING THAT THEY WOULD WANT

01:24:18.820 --> 01:24:20.855
TO BEAR TOOK. A THE TAG THE

01:24:20.922 --> 01:24:22.056
THIRD. INCREASE AT A MINIMUM

01:24:22.123 --> 01:24:22.857
FROM WAY WE'VE BEEN FOR THE-

01:24:22.924 --> 01:24:24.659
SEVERAL BACK- KNOWING THAT IF

01:24:24.726 --> 01:24:26.428
YOU JUST THINK THE PRINCE. WE

01:24:26.494 --> 01:24:29.230
BEAT. WHERE WE ARE NOW- IS

01:24:29.297 --> 01:24:32.100
SOMETHING THAT. CAN SUMMARY. WE

01:24:32.167 --> 01:24:34.569
HAVE GREATLY SIMPLIFIED ACCOUNT

01:24:34.636 --> 01:24:35.203
FOR. MANY MANY OF OUR OUR- AND

01:24:35.270 --> 01:24:37.405
RECIPIENTS. THE AC REQUIRES OF

01:24:37.472 --> 01:24:39.274
THIS AND HOW. HAD ALREADY GONE

01:24:39.340 --> 01:24:41.009
FURTHER IN SOME RESPECTS. THAT

01:24:41.075 --> 01:24:43.044
WAS REQUIRED BY THE LAW. BUT

01:24:43.111 --> 01:24:44.979
THERE ARE KEY GROUPS FOR WHICH

01:24:45.046 --> 01:24:46.514
THE PROCESS WASN'T SIMPLIFIED

01:24:46.581 --> 01:24:48.583
EITHER AS MUCH OR AT ALL. AND

01:24:48.650 --> 01:24:49.350
THEY FOR THE GROUPS ARE TALKING

01:24:49.417 --> 01:24:51.719
ABOUT TODAY. AND THERE'S NOT A

01:24:51.786 --> 01:24:52.754
TREMENDOUS SAVINGS IN THE BANK

01:24:52.821 --> 01:24:55.256
ON FRIDAY I. ADMINISTRATIVE YOU

01:24:55.323 --> 01:24:56.958
KNOW REDUCE THE OF THE NEED TO

01:24:57.025 --> 01:25:00.028
DO THESE TASKS. BUT THERE'S A

01:25:00.094 --> 01:25:02.330
HUGE POTENTIAL. AS EVERYONE. I

01:25:02.397 --> 01:25:04.265
IN THE PRIOR COMMERCE. FROM

01:25:04.332 --> 01:25:05.700
KEEPING PEOPLE. MADE THEIR

01:25:05.767 --> 01:25:07.335
COTTON OF CARE. AND PROVIDING

01:25:07.402 --> 01:25:08.970
PREVENTATIVE SERVICES AND JUST

01:25:09.037 --> 01:25:10.038
OVERALL GENERAL COMMUNITY

01:25:10.104 --> 01:25:12.040
HEALTH WHICH IS A REASON TO DO

01:25:12.106 --> 01:25:13.241
SOMETHING EVEN IF THERE'S NOT A

01:25:13.308 --> 01:25:15.310
DIRECT SAVINGS OFF AND MANY YOU

01:25:15.376 --> 01:25:17.111
KNOW POLICY CONSIDERATIONS.

01:25:17.178 --> 01:25:19.314
POLICY WONK SPEAK RIGHT DOCTOR

01:25:19.380 --> 01:25:20.949
ON THE LEFT. I THINK THE STATE

01:25:21.015 --> 01:25:22.016
IS ALSO I JUST WANT TO GIVE

01:25:22.083 --> 01:25:23.051
THEM A SHOUT OUT THAT THEY'VE

01:25:23.117 --> 01:25:24.419
DONE A LOT OF WORK ON ALONG

01:25:24.486 --> 01:25:27.789
WITH PROVIDERS. AND COUNTIES

01:25:27.856 --> 01:25:28.790
AND- OF ADVOCATES FOR

01:25:28.857 --> 01:25:31.125
RECIPIENTS AND THE MOST RECENT

01:25:31.192 --> 01:25:32.360
ELEVEN FIFTEEN DIVERSE. TRYING

01:25:32.427 --> 01:25:34.028
TO REALLY EXPLORE AND TEST OUT

01:25:34.095 --> 01:25:35.964
WAYS TO CARE FOR QUORUM CARE.

01:25:36.030 --> 01:25:38.366
FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE ELDER

01:25:38.433 --> 01:25:39.501
HAVE DISABILITIES OR OTHER

01:25:39.567 --> 01:25:40.301
CHRONIC CONDITIONS TO THINK

01:25:40.368 --> 01:25:43.071
ABOUT HOW TO OVERALL LOWER THE

01:25:43.137 --> 01:25:44.772
COSTS BUT IMPROVE HEALTH AT THE

01:25:44.839 --> 01:25:46.407
SAME TIME FOR THEM. AND I

01:25:46.474 --> 01:25:48.142
THINK- MORE ABOUT IS IN

01:25:48.209 --> 01:25:50.011
DISCUSSION AND CAL AIM SO I

01:25:50.078 --> 01:25:51.579
THINK THE CONVERSATION SO THEY-

01:25:51.646 --> 01:25:53.147
ARE A BIT LINKED IN THAT WAY.

01:25:53.214 --> 01:25:54.682
ON EVEN THOUGH THE ASSET TEST

01:25:54.749 --> 01:25:55.917
IS OBVIOUSLY SOMETHING AT THE

01:25:55.984 --> 01:25:56.918
VERY FRONT END IS THE

01:25:56.985 --> 01:25:58.419
GATEKEEPER KIND OF THING.

01:25:58.486 --> 01:25:59.888
VERSUS PROVIDING THE SERVICES

01:25:59.954 --> 01:26:01.589
ON THE BACK AND THEY ARE STILL

01:26:01.656 --> 01:26:03.157
VERY HAND IN HAND BUT THINKING

01:26:03.224 --> 01:26:04.259
ABOUT IT THAT WAY I THINK IT'S

01:26:04.325 --> 01:26:14.702
IMPORTANT. WITHOUT ALL I'D BE

01:26:14.769 --> 01:26:15.637
HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS

01:26:15.703 --> 01:26:17.438
THAT THE MAN MAY HAVE. THANK

01:26:17.505 --> 01:26:19.874
YOU VERY- ARE QUESTIONS OF THIS

01:26:19.941 --> 01:26:24.245
SENTIMENT. MISTER CHANG. JUST

01:26:24.312 --> 01:26:25.380
ONE QUICK I DON'T KNOW IF

01:26:25.446 --> 01:26:27.115
YOU'RE A CHANCE TO LOOK AT DH

01:26:27.181 --> 01:26:32.020
CS THAT PART OF THIS. ALL SORRY

01:26:32.086 --> 01:26:34.422
SIR- I. THE KEY. POINTS AND

01:26:34.489 --> 01:26:36.791
ALSO OF THE REAR TERM WHAT'S IN

01:26:36.858 --> 01:26:42.530
THE- WILL YOU SEE OF THE- THE-

01:26:42.597 --> 01:26:45.567
PAST THE- COST ESTIMATES.

01:26:45.633 --> 01:26:46.734
ESPECIALLY ROOM. OPTION ONE OF

01:26:46.801 --> 01:26:49.103
THE AYE TEST FOR YOU LOOKS LIKE

01:26:49.170 --> 01:26:51.773
IT'S A- THIS MADE- INCREASING

01:26:51.839 --> 01:26:52.807
GENERAL FUND ABOUT HOW AND FIVE

01:26:52.874 --> 01:26:56.010
DOLLARS ANNUALLY. I'M I THINK

01:26:56.077 --> 01:26:57.912
IT'S AN EXCELLENT WE'RE NOT

01:26:57.979 --> 01:26:58.713
ABLE TO PULL DOWN THE SAME DATA

01:26:58.780 --> 01:27:01.983
SO WE CAN RECREATE AND REALLY-

01:27:02.050 --> 01:27:04.485
YOU KNOW SORT OF READ IT MATH.

01:27:04.552 --> 01:27:05.219
I DO THINK THAT IT'S CALL TO

01:27:05.286 --> 01:27:06.888
THINK ABOUT IT IN THE TWO BY WE

01:27:06.955 --> 01:27:07.589
WERE LIKE YOUR TALKING ABOUT

01:27:07.655 --> 01:27:10.558
MISSY THE PERSON ALSO YOU COME

01:27:10.625 --> 01:27:14.696
IN. AT OUR FOUNDER. THERE'S-%

01:27:14.762 --> 01:27:17.131
PEOPLE COME IN TODAY AND ARE-

01:27:17.198 --> 01:27:19.601
pTO PROVIDE AND SO THEY SORT OF

01:27:19.667 --> 01:27:20.902
GO AWAY THEY ARE NOT ELIGIBLE I

01:27:20.969 --> 01:27:23.071
GOT MORE AND SPEND- I DO THINK

01:27:23.137 --> 01:27:24.939
THERE MIGHT BE SOME. INTEREST

01:27:25.006 --> 01:27:26.107
AT THE THROUGH WHO NEVER GET TO

01:27:26.174 --> 01:27:28.376
THAT POINT AT ALL I'M

01:27:28.443 --> 01:27:29.344
ESPECIALLY THOSE AS NEW OUTLOOK

01:27:29.410 --> 01:27:31.779
WHO. MAY BE ON EVEN AFTER BEING

01:27:31.846 --> 01:27:33.948
A- FOR ITS BY THREE OR BY

01:27:34.015 --> 01:27:35.483
ADVOCATE THEY SAY NO I'M NOT

01:27:35.550 --> 01:27:36.517
GOING TO BE ELIGIBLE THAT I

01:27:36.584 --> 01:27:38.119
THINK WE HAVE THAT PROBABLY.

01:27:38.186 --> 01:27:40.388
THROUGHOUT OUR SYSTEM- AND IT

01:27:40.455 --> 01:27:41.656
FRANKLY MAY SPEAK TO SOME OF

01:27:41.723 --> 01:27:42.757
THE REASONS WHY WE'RE NOT

01:27:42.824 --> 01:27:45.193
SEEING AS MANY CASES OF MEN

01:27:45.259 --> 01:27:47.562
DURING THE PAN. BUT CERTAIN

01:27:47.629 --> 01:27:48.730
THIS SORT OF SPECTER OF THIS TO

01:27:48.796 --> 01:27:50.098
THEIR IF THEY HAVING A SYSTEM

01:27:50.164 --> 01:27:51.399
FROM THE COUNTY TO COMPLETE

01:27:51.466 --> 01:27:53.167
THAT INFORMATION COULD BE A BIT

01:27:53.234 --> 01:27:55.903
OF A CHILLING EFFECT AS WELL SO-

01:27:55.970 --> 01:27:58.172
I THINK THEY- ON THE NUMBERS

01:27:58.239 --> 01:28:00.708
COULD. BE GREATER IF YOU TAKE

01:28:00.775 --> 01:28:01.843
THAT GROUP INTO AN ACCOUNT SO

01:28:01.909 --> 01:28:04.112
I'M LIKE I SAID I'M NOT ABLE TO

01:28:04.178 --> 01:28:05.647
RUN A DATA AND- ON MY OWN TO

01:28:05.713 --> 01:28:07.315
THINK ABOUT HOW THAT MIGHT

01:28:07.382 --> 01:28:08.850
CHECK OUT. DO YOU HAVE A CELL

01:28:08.916 --> 01:28:11.486
OF WHO THE BEST PEOPLE TO GIVE

01:28:11.552 --> 01:28:22.697
US. YOU KNOW ANOTHER OPINION ON

01:28:22.764 --> 01:28:26.467
THIS NUMBER. WELL I KNOW THAT

01:28:26.534 --> 01:28:27.935
WE WORKED PRETTY CLOSELY WITH

01:28:28.002 --> 01:28:29.003
THE LEGISLATURE ANALYST'S

01:28:29.070 --> 01:28:31.005
OFFICE ON A LOT OF THE OF THE

01:28:31.072 --> 01:28:32.507
STUDY SO NOT TO MORE WORK FOR

01:28:32.573 --> 01:28:34.042
THEM SO I KNOW THAT IS ACTUALLY

01:28:34.108 --> 01:28:35.510
THEIR JOB IT MAY BE A PLACE TO

01:28:35.576 --> 01:28:37.245
THINK OF. LOOKING AT THE

01:28:37.311 --> 01:28:39.347
DIFFERENT THAT BOTH BE SUBJECT

01:28:39.414 --> 01:28:41.482
TO THE ASSET TEST NOW I KIND OF

01:28:41.549 --> 01:28:42.417
WHAT HAVE TO AS THEY GO THROUGH

01:28:42.483 --> 01:28:44.652
THAT PROCESS AND TO THINK ABOUT.

01:28:44.719 --> 01:28:48.022
HOW MIGHT WE ARE IN- WHAT THE

01:28:48.089 --> 01:28:50.591
SHOWING UP AS TO HAVE MODEL NOW

01:28:50.658 --> 01:28:53.861
IS THAT A GROUP OR SMALLER I

01:28:53.928 --> 01:28:55.363
THERE'S AN ASSUMPTION AND IF

01:28:55.430 --> 01:28:56.831
NOT ABOUT IF THE- THAT IF

01:28:56.898 --> 01:28:57.899
SOMEONE WERE NEEDS HEALTH

01:28:57.965 --> 01:29:00.201
COVERAGE AND SOME WHO HAS A THE-

01:29:00.268 --> 01:29:02.070
SOMEONE WHO IS AS SENIOR WHO

01:29:02.136 --> 01:29:05.339
HAS FOR AND THERE'S- MAJOR. PUT

01:29:05.406 --> 01:29:06.407
YOU KNOW HOW TO PUT THEMSELVES

01:29:06.474 --> 01:29:07.442
TO THAT PROCESS BECAUSE THEY

01:29:07.508 --> 01:29:08.643
REALLY NEED THAT. AND IT MIGHT

01:29:08.710 --> 01:29:09.677
BE A GROUP THEN YOU MIGHT GET

01:29:09.744 --> 01:29:12.480
WITH OTHER OF TO LIKE THIS- BUT

01:29:12.547 --> 01:29:14.215
I SAW THINK IT DOES WORK BEAR

01:29:14.282 --> 01:29:16.384
KIND OF LOOKING AND- THANK YOU

01:29:16.451 --> 01:29:17.385
TO YOU YEAH I THINK WE HEARD

01:29:17.452 --> 01:29:19.487
FROM THE C. THAT. SOMETIMES IS

01:29:19.554 --> 01:29:20.021
REALLY FOR THE PEOPLE ARE

01:29:20.088 --> 01:29:21.556
REALLY MORE IS NOT A MATTER IF

01:29:21.622 --> 01:29:24.358
IT'S JUST MATTER OF RIGHT SO I

01:29:24.425 --> 01:29:24.926
THINK WE'RE TRYING TO GET A

01:29:24.992 --> 01:29:28.396
SAID OF REALLY. WHAT IS THE

01:29:28.463 --> 01:29:29.797
REAL THE IT IS COSTS BECAUSE IF

01:29:29.864 --> 01:29:32.033
THERE TO BE ON THE AS POINT

01:29:32.100 --> 01:29:33.334
THEY'RE GOING TO ON THE RULES

01:29:33.401 --> 01:29:35.770
OF SOME POINT- IT'S- THE PEOPLE

01:29:35.837 --> 01:29:37.305
THAT. YOU KNOW WE MAY BE MISSED

01:29:37.371 --> 01:29:39.207
BUT COULD BE COSTING US QUITE

01:29:39.273 --> 01:29:40.041
BIT BECAUSE- THEY'RE GOING TO

01:29:40.108 --> 01:29:43.177
THE ROOM THAN GOING TO- PRIMARY

01:29:43.244 --> 01:29:44.879
SO AGAIN AGAIN WHAT WE'LL TALK

01:29:44.946 --> 01:29:52.954
DALY ALL. I THINK THAT THAT'S

01:29:53.020 --> 01:29:55.490
WHAT YOU'RE- AS A MEMBER OF THE-

01:29:55.556 --> 01:29:58.025
THERE. THERE'S TO BE A GROUP OF

01:29:58.092 --> 01:29:59.227
P. WHO J. IN. THERE'S ALWAYS

01:29:59.293 --> 01:30:00.161
PEOPLE WHO DO KNOW THE COVER.

01:30:00.228 --> 01:30:02.630
THERE TO BE. WITH AND THEY KIND

01:30:02.697 --> 01:30:04.065
OF AND THAT'S- UTILIZED.

01:30:04.132 --> 01:30:06.000
ARMORED ROOM OR OTHER- REALLY

01:30:06.067 --> 01:30:07.735
HIGH AND- WHEN IF WE- HAVE BEEN.

01:30:07.802 --> 01:30:11.139
THEM AND IF. BARRIER OF THE

01:30:11.205 --> 01:30:14.008
ASSET TO BEING IN THE- OR

01:30:14.075 --> 01:30:15.643
CERTAINLY. IF CONSIDER. OF THE

01:30:15.710 --> 01:30:17.278
WE END. THAT OR DO WE ADD TO

01:30:17.345 --> 01:30:18.446
THE TYPE OF CASH. THAT ARE

01:30:18.513 --> 01:30:21.215
EXACT AS MOST. THE WHAT ABOUT I

01:30:21.282 --> 01:30:24.485
THINK. OF THEM THINGS. WITHOUT

01:30:24.552 --> 01:30:27.054
OUTRIGHT LIMITING IT- THAT

01:30:27.121 --> 01:30:28.489
THOSE COULD GET MORE PEOPLE OF

01:30:28.556 --> 01:30:29.824
AND FOR. GET THEM THAT COVER

01:30:29.891 --> 01:30:31.292
EARLY. AND THAT'S KIND OF THING

IT'S A BURDEN FOR THEIR FAMILY

01:34:08.042 --> 01:34:09.243
NO ONE WANTS TO GO OUT AND DO

01:34:09.310 --> 01:34:11.245

OUR DENIALS FOR EXCEEDING THESE

01:34:25.626 --> 01:34:28.062
REQUIREMENTS COMMENT OR IS IT

01:34:28.129 --> 01:34:29.930
MORE COMMON THAT PEOPLE SEE THE

01:34:29.997 --> 01:34:32.633
PAPERWORK AND SAID I'M NOT

01:34:32.700 --> 01:34:33.200
TELLING THEM ANYTHING ABOUT

01:34:33.267 --> 01:34:36.604
THAT- I DO NOT HAVE THE DATA

01:34:36.670 --> 01:34:38.706
THAT I APOLOGIZE- SO I CAN'T

01:34:38.773 --> 01:34:40.541
ANSWER SPECIFICALLY. I KNOW WE

01:34:40.608 --> 01:34:42.943
SEE BOTH. AND AGAIN AS YOUR

01:34:43.010 --> 01:34:44.345
NOTING I MEAN IT'S CERTAINLY

01:34:44.412 --> 01:34:45.880
SOMETHING WE CAN FOLLOW UP WITH

01:34:45.946 --> 01:34:46.747
AND WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENTS

01:34:46.814 --> 01:34:48.215
TO TRY TO PROVIDE. SORT OF THE

01:34:48.282 --> 01:34:50.584
REASON FOR DENIAL- IS ACTUALLY

01:34:50.651 --> 01:34:52.153
DUE TO THE ASSETS OR IS IT DUE

01:34:52.219 --> 01:34:54.822
TO FAILURE TO PROVIDE. I DO- I

01:34:54.889 --> 01:34:57.591
DO THINK THAT- IT'S MORE BASED

01:34:57.658 --> 01:34:58.793
ON WHAT I'VE HEARD FROM OUR

01:34:58.859 --> 01:35:00.728
COUNTIES JUST ANECDOTALLY. BUT

01:35:00.795 --> 01:35:02.563
IT IS STILL MORE PEOPLE GOING

01:35:02.630 --> 01:35:03.531
THROUGH THE PROCESS AND BEING

01:35:03.597 --> 01:35:06.367
TOLD NOW- THAN THOSE WHO JUST

01:35:06.434 --> 01:35:07.568
DROP OUT AND FAILED TO PROVIDE

01:35:07.635 --> 01:35:10.504
THE INFORMATION BUT THERE ARE

01:35:10.571 --> 01:35:11.439
DEFINITELY SOME OF. SO WHAT ARE

01:35:11.505 --> 01:35:13.307
THE MOST COMMON REASONS THAT

01:35:13.374 --> 01:35:15.309
PEOPLE FALL OUT IS IT JUST THEY

01:35:15.376 --> 01:35:16.644
JUST EXCEED THE NUMBER OR IS

01:35:16.710 --> 01:35:19.480
IT- I GUESS I GUESS THAT'S WHAT

01:35:19.547 --> 01:35:22.016
IT WOULD BE. IT WOULD BE YEAH I

01:35:22.083 --> 01:35:23.451
MEAN I MEAN THE BANK ACCOUNTS

01:35:23.517 --> 01:35:25.886
THE TWO THOUSAND AND THREE

01:35:25.953 --> 01:35:26.654
THOUSAND LIMITS ARE FOR BANK

01:35:26.720 --> 01:35:29.023
ACCOUNTS. AND SO SOMEONE HAD

01:35:29.090 --> 01:35:30.357
ESPECIALLY I MEAN WE SAW THIS

01:35:30.424 --> 01:35:32.893
IN THE PROCESS AND TWO THOUSAND

01:35:32.960 --> 01:35:34.495
EIGHT AND NINE. ALL YEAR WE HAD

01:35:34.562 --> 01:35:35.830
A REALLY GOOD ECONOMY AND SOME

01:35:35.896 --> 01:35:37.765
PEOPLE HAD PUT AWAY. EVEN JUST

01:35:37.832 --> 01:35:38.899
A FEW THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR

01:35:38.966 --> 01:35:40.534
EMERGENCIES AND THEN THEY WERE

01:35:40.601 --> 01:35:42.069
TOLD YOU HAVE TO SPEND DOWN.

01:35:42.136 --> 01:35:43.604
THAT MONEY TO BE ABLE TO COME

01:35:43.671 --> 01:35:45.039
BACK SO PEOPLE MAY GO AWAY AND

01:35:45.106 --> 01:35:46.307
THIS IS WHY SO MANY DO COME

01:35:46.373 --> 01:35:47.942
BACK WE'LL GO. ALL RIGHT WELL

01:35:48.008 --> 01:35:49.477
I'LL GO SPEND THAT MONEY. AND

01:35:49.543 --> 01:35:51.245
INSTEAD OF SAVING AT ALL SPEND

01:35:51.312 --> 01:35:53.247
IT ON SOMETHING AND- THAT'S

01:35:53.314 --> 01:35:54.482
THAT'S KIND OF THAT THE CHOICE

01:35:54.548 --> 01:35:55.583

THAT'S KIND OF BEEN

01:40:23.784 --> 01:40:25.119

THEY MEET OUR ASSET LIMITS OR

01:40:41.869 --> 01:40:44.104
NOT. THAT WOULD BE LIKE ONE OF

01:40:44.171 --> 01:40:46.440
THE FIRST DECIDING FACTORS TO

OR SPEND DOWN UNDER OUR ASSET

01:40:56.283 --> 01:40:58.385

TO SPEND DOWN ON THOSE LIMITS

01:45:43.403 --> 01:45:45.572
SO THAT THEY CAN THEN QUALIFY.

01:45:45.639 --> 01:45:47.974

01:45:53.613 --> 01:45:55.015
THEN DETERMINE THE COST

01:45:55.082 --> 01:45:57.117
OPTIONS. AND AGAIN WHEN WE LOOK

01:45:57.184 --> 01:45:59.052

RESPOND ON CELL IN MY GOING

01:46:30.984 --> 01:46:32.786
OVER THE THREE OPTIONS I HOPE

01:46:32.853 --> 01:46:34.321
TO COVER MOST OF THOSE

01:46:34.387 --> 01:46:36.623
QUESTIONS THAT WERE POSED TO US

01:46:36.690 --> 01:46:38.658
AND THEN AT THE END I'LL TALK A

01:46:38.725 --> 01:46:39.392
LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE FROM

01:46:39.459 --> 01:46:40.494
SYMPTOMS OF EACH OF THE

OPTIONS. AND THEN ALSO THE

01:46:42.529 --> 01:46:43.764
FEDERAL AUTHORITIES THAT WE

01:46:43.830 --> 01:46:46.833
COULD MOVE IN TERMS OF HOW WE

01:46:46.900 --> 01:46:49.970

FUTURE. SO AGAIN THE WAY THE

01:46:58.278 --> 01:47:01.181
REPORT LAID OUT- THE NUMBERS

01:47:01.248 --> 01:47:02.949
THAT WE HAD IDENTIFIED ARE

01:47:03.016 --> 01:47:05.552
TRULY NEW ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUALS

01:47:05.619 --> 01:47:08.889
THAT WILL COME. PROGRAM EACH OF

01:47:08.955 --> 01:47:09.689
THE OPTIONS THAT WERE

01:47:09.756 --> 01:47:12.626
IDENTIFIED. ALL RIGHT I DO ALSO

WANT TO CALL OUT THAT THE

01:47:14.427 --> 01:47:16.096
NUMBERS IN THE CALCULATIONS

01:47:16.163 --> 01:47:18.165
WERE BASED ON A POINT IN TIME

01:47:18.231 --> 01:47:20.133
SO DEPENDING UPON THE OPTION

01:47:20.200 --> 01:47:21.868
THAT MAY BE ADVANCED IN

01:47:21.935 --> 01:47:25.272
CALIFORNIA- INDIVIDUALS THAT

WERE EITHER PREVIOUSLY DENIED

01:47:26.973 --> 01:47:28.175
OR THAT DID NOT COMPLETE THE

01:47:28.241 --> 01:47:29.843
FULL MEDICAL APPLICATION

01:47:29.910 --> 01:47:31.912
PROCESS. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE

01:47:31.978 --> 01:47:34.114
POTENTIAL FUTURE ELIGIBLE MAY

01:47:34.181 --> 01:47:36.583
BE AND THERE MAY BE ADDITIONAL

01:47:36.650 --> 01:47:38.485
INCREASES IN OUR POPULATIONS

01:47:38.552 --> 01:47:40.554
JUST BASED UPON ASSETS MAY BE

01:47:40.620 --> 01:47:42.789
TREATED GINGER WE DO NOT KNOW

01:47:42.856 --> 01:47:44.424
WHAT BACK IMPACTING OUR

01:47:44.491 --> 01:47:46.827
ASSESSMENT WAS REALLY BASED ON

01:47:46.893 --> 01:47:48.695
JUST THAT SET UP INDIVIDUALS

01:47:48.762 --> 01:47:50.564

01:47:50.630 --> 01:47:55.569
FONG. FROM. THE DATA THAT WAS

01:47:55.635 --> 01:47:56.169
PROVIDED TO US. SO IN THE AT

01:47:56.236 --> 01:47:57.337
OPTION ON ONE THIS IS THE

01:47:57.404 --> 01:48:00.340
OPTION ELIMINATE THE ASSET TAG.

01:48:00.407 --> 01:48:02.242
AS INDICATED IN THE REPORT-

01:48:02.309 --> 01:48:05.912
THIS OPTION I'M HAS EIGHTY TWO

01:48:05.979 --> 01:48:06.913
HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION

01:48:06.980 --> 01:48:10.450
DOLLAR TOTAL FINE- COSTS

01:48:10.517 --> 01:48:13.386
ASSOCIATED WITH. IT IT IS THE

01:48:13.453 --> 01:48:15.222
OPTION THAT HAS THE ESTIMATED

01:48:15.288 --> 01:48:16.756
HIGHEST NUMBER OF NEWLY

01:48:16.823 --> 01:48:20.126
ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUALS A

01:48:20.193 --> 01:48:20.627
SEVENTEEN THOUSAND EIGHT

01:48:20.694 --> 01:48:22.329
HUNDRED AND TWO. AND AGAIN IN

01:48:22.395 --> 01:48:25.866
LOOKING AT THIS- THIS- THIS

01:48:25.932 --> 01:48:28.768
OPTION AND HOW IT WORKS FINE SO

01:48:28.835 --> 01:48:30.971
IF WE HAVE AN APPLICANT WHO HAD

01:48:31.037 --> 01:48:31.705
TWELVE THOUSAND DOLLARS IN A

01:48:31.771 --> 01:48:34.541
SAVINGS ACCOUNT. ON THE SECOND

NINETY EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS

01:48:37.510 --> 01:48:39.412
UNDER OUR RULES TODAY THEY WILL

01:48:39.479 --> 01:48:41.114
BE IN ELIGIBLE FOR PROGRAM

01:48:41.181 --> 01:48:42.649
BECAUSE THEY'RE OVER THE TWO

01:48:42.716 --> 01:48:44.484
THOUSAND DOLLAR ASSET LIMIT.

01:48:44.551 --> 01:48:46.152
AND THEN THAT SECOND VEHICLE IN

01:48:46.219 --> 01:48:47.687
A SAVINGS ACCOUNT WITH BACON

01:48:47.754 --> 01:48:52.826
OVER. OUR ASSETS. SO IF THERE'S

01:48:52.893 --> 01:48:55.362
MORE INFORMED. THERE WOULD BE

01:48:55.428 --> 01:48:57.097
NO TASK AND THEN THE END OF THE

WITH THE ASSESSED FROM ALPHA ON

01:48:59.666 --> 01:49:02.569
THEIR ACCOUNT IN. AND THAT IS

01:49:02.636 --> 01:49:05.105
SOME TO WHAT WE DID. OUR NON

01:49:05.171 --> 01:49:07.707
MATCH I'VE AYE FARM I'VE- AND

01:49:07.774 --> 01:49:08.909
AGAIN THOSE ARE BASS ON THE

01:49:08.975 --> 01:49:10.210
CHANGES THAT WERE DONE UNDER

01:49:10.277 --> 01:49:12.512
THE AFFORDABLE CARE AND AS WAS

01:49:12.579 --> 01:49:13.980
STATED EARLIER JUST AS A

THAT LAND JOHN HIGH- CAMPBELL

01:49:21.955 --> 01:49:24.457
INCOME LIMITS FOR THE PROGRAM

01:49:24.524 --> 01:49:27.527
AND THERE IS NO CONCEPT ONE.

01:49:27.594 --> 01:49:28.528
WHICH SO IN THE AT OPTION

01:49:28.595 --> 01:49:31.398
NUMBER TWO. THIS WOULD NEED TO

01:49:31.464 --> 01:49:33.533
INCREASE THE ASSET LIMITS-

01:49:33.600 --> 01:49:35.769
AGAIN WE LOOK AT INCREASING

01:49:35.835 --> 01:49:37.437
ASSET LIMITS FOR AN INDIVIDUAL

01:49:37.504 --> 01:49:39.239

EACH ADDITIONAL HOUSEHOLD

01:49:41.808 --> 01:49:43.777
MEMBER AND THEN TO CHANGE THE

01:49:43.843 --> 01:49:45.211
TREATMENT OF CERTAIN ASSETS

01:49:45.278 --> 01:49:46.880
SUCH AS NOT COUNTY MULTIPLE

01:49:46.947 --> 01:49:48.848
VEHICLES. OR RETIREMENT

01:49:48.915 --> 01:49:51.551
ACCOUNTS IN THE ASSET. THESE

01:49:51.618 --> 01:49:53.119
ARE COMMON ASSETS THAT WE DID

01:49:53.186 --> 01:49:54.921
SEE WHAT APPLICATIONS AND AGAIN

01:49:54.988 --> 01:49:56.356
THIS OPTION WAS BASED ON SOME

01:49:56.423 --> 01:50:00.427
MORE PROVISIONS IN EIGHTY SIX

01:50:00.493 --> 01:50:01.294
EIGHTY THREE OF THAT COMING UP.

01:50:01.361 --> 01:50:03.797
I THE ESTIMATED TOTAL- FISCAL

01:50:03.863 --> 01:50:05.999
IMPACT IS NINETY ONE MILLION

01:50:06.066 --> 01:50:08.301

AND SEVENTY. AND AGAIN HAS A

01:50:17.444 --> 01:50:18.945
SIMILAR EXAMPLE WE HAVE AN

01:50:19.012 --> 01:50:20.714
INDIVIDUAL WHO IS SIXTY FIVE

01:50:20.780 --> 01:50:22.615

01:50:27.620 --> 01:50:30.023
VALUED AT STATE TWENTY SIX

01:50:30.090 --> 01:50:31.057
THOUSAND DOLLARS BUT THE

OUR RULES TODAY THAT APPLICANT

01:50:44.704 --> 01:50:46.139
WOULD BE AN ELIGIBLE FOR

01:50:46.206 --> 01:50:47.807
MEDICARE NOW BECAUSE THEY'RE

01:50:47.874 --> 01:50:49.909
OVER THE ASSET LIMIT BECAUSE OF

01:50:49.976 --> 01:50:54.214
BAD A SAVINGS ACCOUNT. THAT I

01:50:54.280 --> 01:50:54.848
CANNOT IN THE RETIREMENT. IF WE

01:50:54.914 --> 01:50:57.350
WERE EMPLOY THE TO BECAUSE OF

01:50:57.417 --> 01:51:00.053
RAISING ASSET LIMITS SAID TEN

INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS

01:51:04.290 --> 01:51:06.226
THE RETIREMENT ACCOUNT WOULD NO

01:51:06.292 --> 01:51:07.994
LONGER BE COUNTABLE. AND THEN

01:51:08.061 --> 01:51:10.463
THE APPLICANT WOULD PASS ONE

01:51:10.530 --> 01:51:12.699
CAR ASSETS. AND LOOKING AT

01:51:12.766 --> 01:51:14.601
OPTION NUMBER THREE THIS WAS

01:51:14.667 --> 01:51:16.369
JUST TO LOOK AT INCREASING

01:51:16.436 --> 01:51:19.572
ASSET LIMITS AND AGAIN AT TEN

01:51:19.639 --> 01:51:20.507
THOUSAND FOR AN INDIVIDUAL AND

01:51:20.573 --> 01:51:22.342
THEN FIVE THOUSAND FOR EACH

ADDITIONAL HOUSEHOLD MEMBER.

01:51:24.110 --> 01:51:27.013
AND THAT FISCAL IMPACT IS

01:51:27.080 --> 01:51:27.647
SEVENTY THREE POINT FIVE MONEY

01:51:27.714 --> 01:51:30.083
TALKS. ARE THE ESTIMATED NEWLY

01:51:30.150 --> 01:51:31.885
ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUALS IN THIS

01:51:31.951 --> 01:51:34.988
OPTION IS FIVE THOUSAND SIX

01:51:35.055 --> 01:51:36.022
HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT. AND

01:51:36.089 --> 01:51:37.857
AGAIN AS AN EXAMPLE OF A PERSON

01:51:37.924 --> 01:51:40.293
HAD EIGHT OF FORTY EIGHT

01:51:40.360 --> 01:51:41.861
HUNDRED DOLLAR SAVINGS ACCOUNT.

01:51:41.928 --> 01:51:43.730
AND THAT INDIVIDUAL WOULD BE AN

01:51:43.797 --> 01:51:45.832
ELIGIBLE BUT IF WE HAVE OPTION

01:51:45.899 --> 01:51:47.934
THREE IN PLACE. I BECAUSE OF

01:51:48.001 --> 01:51:49.536
RAISING THE ASSET LIMITS THEY

01:51:49.602 --> 01:51:53.473
WOULD PASS THE ASSET. WITHIN OF

01:51:53.540 --> 01:51:55.008
THE OPTIONS WE DID DETERMINE

01:51:55.075 --> 01:51:57.210
NEWLY ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUALS

01:51:57.277 --> 01:51:58.178
BASED UPON THOSE THAT WERE

01:51:58.244 --> 01:51:59.979
DENIED FROM MEDIC COW OR FOR

01:52:00.046 --> 01:52:02.182
THE MEDICARE SAVINGS PROGRAMS.

01:52:02.248 --> 01:52:05.485
AS ACT EXCESS ASSETS AND THOSE

01:52:05.552 --> 01:52:07.287
INDIVIDUALS I DID NOT SPEND

01:52:07.353 --> 01:52:10.323
DOWN ON THE ASSETS TO BECOME

01:52:10.390 --> 01:52:12.926
ELIGIBLE. ANOTHER AREA THAT WE

01:52:12.992 --> 01:52:14.561
AT LOOK AT IN THE REPORT WAS AT

01:52:14.627 --> 01:52:17.230
THE ANNUAL INDEXING OF ASSETS.

01:52:17.297 --> 01:52:18.865
THIS IS DONE WITH THE MEDICARE

01:52:18.932 --> 01:52:20.567
SAVINGS PROGRAM BUT FOR

01:52:20.633 --> 01:52:23.603
MEDICAID PROGRAMS THIS IS NOT

01:52:23.670 --> 01:52:25.238
SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN DONE.

01:52:25.305 --> 01:52:26.706
SO IN LOOKING AT THE

01:52:26.773 --> 01:52:28.541
FEASIBILITY OF THIS I'M JUST

01:52:28.608 --> 01:52:30.176
LOOKING AT WHAT CHANGES WHAT

01:52:30.243 --> 01:52:32.679
THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX- THE

01:52:32.745 --> 01:52:35.348
ANNUAL UPDATE USING ONE OUR

01:52:35.415 --> 01:52:38.485
ASSET LIMITS ARE- WHAT HAVE A

01:52:38.551 --> 01:52:40.787
HIGH SYSTEM COST BECAUSE OF THE

01:52:40.854 --> 01:52:41.855
CHANGES THAT WE WOUL HAVE TO

01:52:41.921 --> 01:52:43.590
MAKE. TO THE ELIGIBILITY

01:52:43.656 --> 01:52:46.226
SYSTEMS UPDATE THOSE- IN

01:52:46.292 --> 01:52:49.295
INDICES ON ANNUAL BASIS. AND

01:52:49.362 --> 01:52:51.331
THEN THERE'S ALSO THE NEED TO

01:52:51.397 --> 01:52:53.933
THEN MAKE- TO APPLY THOSE

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:56.202
CHANGES ON AN ANNUAL BASIS SO

01:52:56.269 --> 01:52:58.371
AS THEY CHANGE THEIR MORE HAVE

01:52:58.438 --> 01:53:00.406
TO UPDATE AND RE RUN

01:53:00.473 --> 01:53:02.442
ELIGIBILITY FOR INDIVIDUALS.

01:53:02.509 --> 01:53:03.977
THIS IS SIMILAR TO WHAT

01:53:04.043 --> 01:53:05.545
HAPPENS. GOLD ONE WE HAVE INYO

01:53:05.612 --> 01:53:09.115
FTL UPDATE. ON THAT UPDATE WHEN

01:53:09.182 --> 01:53:11.284
WE HAVE FAILED CHANGES ARE

01:53:11.351 --> 01:53:13.486
OFTEN NOT AVAILABLE UNTIL A FEW

01:53:13.553 --> 01:53:15.889
MONTHS LATER- WHEN BE

01:53:15.955 --> 01:53:18.958
EFFECTIVE- NEW OUTBREAKS COME

01:53:19.025 --> 01:53:20.627
OUT FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

01:53:20.693 --> 01:53:22.562
SO THIS DOES WORK OUR COUNTY

01:53:22.629 --> 01:53:24.831
ELIGIBILITY WORKERS TO DO MINE

01:53:24.898 --> 01:53:26.533
THE TERMINATION.BACK TO THE

01:53:26.599 --> 01:53:28.668
ACTUAL AFFECTED IMPLEMENTATION

01:53:28.735 --> 01:53:31.104
DATE I'M OF THOSE CHANGES

01:55:18.177 --> 01:55:21.581
THE ESTIMATES THAT WE CAN. IN

01:55:21.648 --> 01:55:22.782

THE ASSET LIMIT CAN ONE CHANGE

01:55:27.053 --> 01:55:27.854
THE TREATMENT OF CERTAIN

01:55:27.920 --> 01:55:30.957
ASSETS. IT DOES HELP US TO BE

01:55:31.024 --> 01:55:32.492
MORE IN ALIGNMENT WITH THE

01:55:32.558 --> 01:55:34.294
CURRENT COST OF LIVING BY

INCREASING ASSET LIMITS FOR NON

MATCH I PROGRAMS AND IT DOES

01:55:38.264 --> 01:55:40.400
PROVIDE SOME MORE GLOBAL MOVIE

01:55:40.466 --> 01:55:42.869
FOR INDIVIDUALS ARE RELATED TO.

01:55:42.935 --> 01:55:45.438
ASSETS WHEN IT DOES A LINE WITH

CON YOU KNOW STILL DEALING

01:55:56.115 --> 01:55:58.051
WITH- BETTER TREATMENT OF

01:55:58.117 --> 01:56:00.453
SPECIFIC ASSETS IS COMPLEX

01:56:00.520 --> 01:56:02.922
THERE COULD BE SOME INITIAL-

01:56:02.989 --> 01:56:05.825
INAPPROPRIATE APPLICATIONS- OF

01:56:05.892 --> 01:56:08.294
THE ASSETS WHERE THERE COULD BE

01:56:08.361 --> 01:56:10.096
SOME INCORRECT ELIGIBILITY

01:56:10.163 --> 01:56:12.498
DETERMINATIONS AS OUR CAMERAS

01:56:12.565 --> 01:56:13.933
ARE BECOMING FAMILIAR WITH THE

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:16.169
NEW POLICIES BUT THAT IS

01:56:16.235 --> 01:56:17.303
SOMETHING THAT OUR CARS YOU

01:56:17.370 --> 01:56:19.605
KNOW THAT CAN OCCUR WHEN WE

01:56:19.672 --> 01:56:21.441
HAVE NEW POLICY CHANGES OR FROM

01:56:21.507 --> 01:56:24.744
WHAT WE DO FORCE CORRECT. AND

01:56:24.811 --> 01:56:26.879
IN TERMS OF JUST OPTION THREE

01:56:26.946 --> 01:56:28.481
LOOKING BACK INCREASE THE ASSET

01:56:28.548 --> 01:56:32.151
LIMITS AGAIN. WILL BE A BETTER

01:56:32.218 --> 01:56:33.586
ALIGNMENT WITH CURRENT COST OF

01:56:33.653 --> 01:56:35.054
LIVING FOR INCREASING ASSET

01:56:35.121 --> 01:56:37.390
LIMITS OR BOTH ARE NOT

01:56:37.457 --> 01:56:38.458
MAIENSCHEIN AND I'M LIKE

01:56:38.524 --> 01:56:41.694
SAVINGS. IT IS THE LEAST COSTLY

01:56:41.761 --> 01:56:43.663
OF THE THREE OPTIONS AND

01:56:43.730 --> 01:56:45.298
THEREFORE IN MANY INDIVIDUALS

01:56:45.365 --> 01:56:46.899
THAT WE'RE DEADLINE FOR BEING

01:56:46.966 --> 01:56:49.235
OVER A FAST SUPPLEMENTS I'M IT

01:56:49.302 --> 01:56:51.637
COULD- INCREASE THE NUMBER OF

01:56:51.704 --> 01:56:53.840
PEOPLE THAT CAN BECOME ELIGIBLE

01:56:53.906 --> 01:56:55.375
FOR OUR- THERE ARE STILL IN

01:56:55.441 --> 01:56:57.310
TERMS OF A CON THERE ARE STILL

01:56:57.377 --> 01:57:00.513
MANY TO A SENSE FOR AVAILABLE

01:57:00.580 --> 01:57:03.116
ASSETS FOR INDIVIDUALS AND TO

01:57:03.182 --> 01:57:04.650
DETERMINE WHAT IS OR IS NOT

01:57:04.717 --> 01:57:10.189
AVAILABLE. WHEN MAKING.

01:57:10.256 --> 01:57:11.491
ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATIONS. THE

01:57:11.557 --> 01:57:12.692
LAST THING I DO WANT TO TALK ON

01:57:12.759 --> 01:57:16.162
IS. ON IN LOOKING AT DISK WITH

01:57:16.229 --> 01:57:18.598
OUR FEDERAL COURT. IN TERMS OF

01:57:18.664 --> 01:57:20.400
WHY THIS FEDERAL FROM SO ALL OF

01:57:20.466 --> 01:57:27.273
THE OPTIONS OBVIOUSLY. FROM WE

01:57:27.340 --> 01:57:29.375
CAN MAKE THE CHANGE THROUGH-

01:57:29.442 --> 01:57:32.178
SAFE AND THEN HOWEVER IF WE

01:57:32.245 --> 01:57:34.046
WANTED TO A WOMEN THE LONG TERM

01:57:34.113 --> 01:57:36.449
CARE POPULATION- FOR IN OF

01:57:36.516 --> 01:57:39.118
THESE. AND WE HAVE TO FILE A

01:57:39.185 --> 01:57:40.453
FEDERAL WAIVER DUE TO

01:57:40.520 --> 01:57:43.089
PROFITABILITY BECAUSE WE CANNOT

01:57:43.156 --> 01:57:44.891
TREAT POPULATIONS THAT FALL

01:57:44.957 --> 01:57:46.926
WITHIN THE SAME COVERAGE BURKE

01:57:46.993 --> 01:57:47.393
WE CANNOT TREAT THEM

01:57:47.460 --> 01:57:49.896
DIFFERENTLY SO IF THERE WAS A

01:57:49.962 --> 01:57:51.964
DESIRE TO LOOK AT THE TREATMENT

01:57:52.031 --> 01:57:57.370
OF ASSETS BOB FOR PEOPLE THAT.

01:57:57.437 --> 01:57:58.504
MAY BE ON TERM CARE. I THEN WE

01:57:58.571 --> 01:57:59.605
WOULD HAVE TO SEEK A FEDERAL

01:57:59.672 --> 01:58:02.575
WAIVER OUT FOR MAKING CHANGE.

01:58:02.642 --> 01:58:05.077
SO AT THIS I LIKE TO STOCK IN

01:58:05.144 --> 01:58:06.846
THEN WELL ANY COMMENTS

01:58:06.913 --> 01:58:10.783
QUESTIONS FROM. THANK YOU VERY

01:58:10.850 --> 01:58:15.321
MUCH- QUESTIONS. MR TANG A

01:58:15.388 --> 01:58:16.322
QUICK QUICK QUESTION COULD YOU

01:58:16.389 --> 01:58:18.724
WALK THROUGH HOW YOU GOT TO THE

01:58:18.791 --> 01:58:22.094
SEVENTEEN THOUSAND. SO

01:58:22.161 --> 01:58:22.662
SEVENTEEN THOUSAND WE FIRST

01:58:22.728 --> 01:58:24.730
LOOK AT THOSE INDIVIDUALS THAT

01:58:24.797 --> 01:58:26.799
HAVE APPLIED FOR COVERAGE. AND

01:58:26.866 --> 01:58:28.267
THOSE INDIVIDUALS THAT WERE

01:58:28.334 --> 01:58:30.303
IDENTIFIED TO BE ELIGIBLE AND

01:58:30.369 --> 01:58:32.605
THEN FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO

01:58:32.672 --> 01:58:35.074
HAVE APPLIED FOR COVERAGE. OUT

01:58:35.141 --> 01:58:36.776
ONE OVER THE ASSET AMOUNTS BUT

01:58:36.843 --> 01:58:39.045
HAD SUBSEQUENTLY COME BACK AND

01:58:39.111 --> 01:58:40.847
HAD SPENT DOWN TO THOSE ASSETS

01:58:40.913 --> 01:58:43.216
AND THEN BECAME ELIGIBLE IT WAS

01:58:43.282 --> 01:58:44.817
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THOSE

01:58:44.884 --> 01:58:46.652
TWO NUMBERS. IN TERMS OF HOW WE

01:58:46.719 --> 01:58:48.521
CAME UP WITH A NET NEW ELIGIBLE

01:58:48.588 --> 01:58:55.361
INDIVIDUALS OUT FOR THAT- GOT

01:58:55.428 --> 01:58:56.996
HE DID DID DID DETERMINE PEOPLE

01:58:57.063 --> 01:58:58.831
WHO WOULD EVENTUALLY BECOME

01:58:58.898 --> 01:59:00.099
ELIGIBLE AND YOU TOOK THE

01:59:00.166 --> 01:59:01.934
DIFFERENCE THAT. THAT'S THE

01:59:02.001 --> 01:59:04.770
ONLY TWO THOUSAND MINUS THE

01:59:04.837 --> 01:59:06.005
FOUR SIX HUNDRED OR SO. OKAY

01:59:06.072 --> 01:59:09.742
THANK YOU. YOUR THANK YOU

01:59:09.809 --> 01:59:13.613
OTHERS AFTER REGULAR THANK YOU

01:59:13.679 --> 01:59:15.781
AND- DIRECTOR LAKEPORT IT'S

01:59:15.848 --> 01:59:17.350
NICE TALKING TO YOU TWO DAYS IN

01:59:17.416 --> 01:59:19.051
A ROW INTO DO NOTICE THAT YOU

01:59:19.118 --> 01:59:21.287
WERE SHORT ON WORDS TODAY BUT

01:59:21.354 --> 01:59:24.924
DO WANTS TO ACTUALLY- ABOUT

01:59:24.991 --> 01:59:27.393
YOUR- CHOICE ARCHITECTURE AND

01:59:27.460 --> 01:59:29.328
I'M SORRY TO GET WONKY AGAIN

01:59:29.395 --> 01:59:31.197
BUT- THE IDEA THAT WHEN YOU

01:59:31.264 --> 01:59:33.966
pBENEFIT FROM ONE OF GATE

01:59:34.033 --> 01:59:36.736
KEEPING TO ONE. OF COVERAGE

01:59:36.802 --> 01:59:38.104
IT'S A CHANGE IN MENTALITY AS

01:59:38.170 --> 01:59:39.906
WELL. SO WANTED TO ASK YOU IF I

01:59:39.972 --> 01:59:42.675
COULD ABOUT THE C. W. D. A.'S

01:59:42.742 --> 01:59:44.810
COMMENTS THAT THE ACID TEST HAS

01:59:44.877 --> 01:59:46.946
A CHILLING EFFECT. INSIDE I

01:59:47.013 --> 01:59:48.147
THINK THE OPPOSITE OF THAT THEN

01:59:48.214 --> 01:59:50.516
IS TO QUESTION WHETHER REMOVING

01:59:50.583 --> 01:59:52.385
THE ASSET TEST MAKES US A

01:59:52.451 --> 01:59:53.586
WARMER AND MORE COMPASSIONATE

01:59:53.653 --> 01:59:56.856
STATE. AND MOVES US CLOSER TO

01:59:56.923 --> 01:59:58.591
UNIVERSAL COVERAGE. AS WE LOOK

01:59:58.658 --> 02:00:00.860
DURING THIS PANDEMIC I HOPE WE

02:00:00.927 --> 02:00:02.562
ALSO SEE THAT THE HEALTH OF

02:00:02.628 --> 02:00:04.030
EACH OF US IS DEPENDENT ON THE

02:00:04.096 --> 02:00:05.631
HEALTH OF ALL OF US. AND THAT

02:00:05.698 --> 02:00:06.966
WAS OUR ELDERLY DURING THIS

02:00:07.033 --> 02:00:09.402
PANDEMIC WHO BORE THE BRUNT OF

02:00:09.468 --> 02:00:11.571
THE PANDEMIC. AND WOULD HOPE

02:00:11.637 --> 02:00:13.039
THAT WE COULD FIGURE OUT HOW WE

02:00:13.105 --> 02:00:15.875
COULD HELP TO ENCOURAGE HIM TO

02:00:15.942 --> 02:00:18.544
MOVE TOWARDS UNIVERSAL COVERAGE

02:00:18.611 --> 02:00:19.979
BY INCLUDING THIS CONVERSATION.

02:00:20.046 --> 02:00:22.748
I WILL ADD IT AS WELL HAVING

02:00:22.815 --> 02:00:24.884
BEEN AN EMERGENCY ROOM DOCTOR.

02:00:24.951 --> 02:00:26.919
I KNOW THAT PEOPLE ARE ONE FOUR

02:00:26.986 --> 02:00:27.920
HUNDRED DOLLAR EMERGENCY AWAY

02:00:27.987 --> 02:00:30.156
FROM FINANCIAL DISTRESS AND

02:00:30.222 --> 02:00:32.224
LOOKING AT THESE ASSETS LIMITS

02:00:32.291 --> 02:00:33.392
OF TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS AND

02:00:33.459 --> 02:00:34.493
THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS. IT

02:00:34.560 --> 02:00:36.729
MAKES ME CONCERNED THAT WE

02:00:36.796 --> 02:00:38.864
REALLY ARE CREATING A SYSTEM

02:00:38.931 --> 02:00:41.000
THAT IS PLACING STRESS ON TO

02:00:41.067 --> 02:00:43.336
OUR COMMUNITIES. FINAL AND THIS

02:00:43.402 --> 02:00:45.438
IS JUST THE REAL QUESTION IT

02:00:45.504 --> 02:00:48.240
SEEMED AS IF C. W. D. A. WAS

02:00:48.307 --> 02:00:49.675
SAYING THAT THE PURPOSE OF

02:00:49.742 --> 02:00:52.078
CATALAN WHOLE PERSON CARES WAS

02:00:52.144 --> 02:00:54.714
TO MOVE. IN A DIRECTION THAT

02:00:54.780 --> 02:00:56.282
WAS MORE PREVENTATIVE TO MOVE

02:00:56.349 --> 02:00:57.617
IN A DIRECTION THAT INCREASED

02:00:57.683 --> 02:01:00.152
CONTINUITY OF CARE AND IT SEEMS

02:01:00.219 --> 02:01:02.021
THAT BY REMOVING THE ASSET TEST

02:01:02.088 --> 02:01:03.389
WE WOULD INCREASE CONTINUITY OF

02:01:03.456 --> 02:01:05.491
CARE. AND MOVE IN THE DIRECTION

02:01:05.558 --> 02:01:08.661
THAT CALIFORNIA'S IS. POINTING

02:01:08.728 --> 02:01:11.097
US IN AND WOULD ASK IF YOU

02:01:11.163 --> 02:01:13.699
WOULD AGREE WITH C. WTA'S-

02:01:13.766 --> 02:01:19.138
ASSESSMENT- THANK YOU FOR THE

02:01:19.205 --> 02:01:23.576
QUESTION- FIRST I WOULD SAY-

02:01:23.643 --> 02:01:26.178
QUOTE CENTER LANGS OF OBSERVER

02:01:26.245 --> 02:01:29.649
ABOUT THE SORT OF THE- BOB

02:01:29.715 --> 02:01:32.151
WARMTH IN TELLING TO OF THEIR A

02:01:32.218 --> 02:01:37.456
BURIAL PLOT. SPEAKS FOR ITSELF-

02:01:37.523 --> 02:01:39.959
IT IN TERMS OF THE OF. IN THE

02:01:40.026 --> 02:01:42.228
ABILITY OF PEOPLE GET CARE

02:01:42.294 --> 02:01:46.165
EARLIER ON COVERAGE EARLY ON

02:01:46.232 --> 02:01:47.800
RIGHT I THINK IT IS WITH THE

02:01:47.867 --> 02:01:51.404
ARMOR GOALS ARE STRONG OF

02:06:56.709 --> 02:06:58.577
THE LARGEST STATE IN THE UNION.

02:06:58.644 --> 02:06:59.945
THEN WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO

02:07:00.012 --> 02:07:00.713

CONCERN ABOUT HOW MUCH THIS IS

02:07:26.305 --> 02:07:29.408
GOING TO COST THE STATE. NINE

02:07:29.475 --> 02:07:31.410
IT'S GONNA POINT ONCE AGAIN TO

02:07:31.477 --> 02:07:33.345
THE STATE AUDITOR'S ET DE

SAY IT AGAIN TEN POINT FOUR

02:07:46.692 --> 02:07:52.865
BILLION DOLLARS. BUT YET WE'RE

02:07:52.931 --> 02:07:55.434
HAVING A FINANCIAL DEBATE.

02:07:55.501 --> 02:08:00.739
ABOUT ENSURING. FAMILIES IN THE

02:08:00.806 --> 02:08:03.542

HERE ANYONE ELSE I JUST JUST A

02:08:23.128 --> 02:08:24.363
COUPLE QUESTIONS AND THEN THAT

02:08:24.430 --> 02:08:25.664
WAY HE WILL WANT TO MOVE ON TO

02:08:25.731 --> 02:08:27.332
OUR NEXT PANEL- SO THE REPORT

02:08:27.399 --> 02:08:29.601
INDICATES THAT ROUGHLY TWO

02:08:29.668 --> 02:08:31.236
MILLION PEOPLE ARE SUBJECT TO

02:08:31.303 --> 02:08:33.105
AN ASSET TEST WHAT IS THE

02:08:33.172 --> 02:08:34.573
BREAKDOWN LOOK LIKE ARE THESE

02:08:34.640 --> 02:08:38.210
PRIMARILY SENIORS- DO WE HAVE.

02:08:38.277 --> 02:08:41.046
A HANDLE ON. THAT CAN WE HAVE

02:08:41.113 --> 02:08:42.981
A- BACK OF THE BACK OF THE

02:08:43.048 --> 02:08:45.484
NAPKIN ESTIMATE OF WHAT'S YOU

02:08:45.551 --> 02:08:46.085
KNOW WITH WITH THIS POPULATION

02:08:46.151 --> 02:08:49.888
LOOKS LIKE. SO THIS IS RUNNING

02:08:49.955 --> 02:08:51.857
SO IT WOULD BE FOR OUR SENIORS

02:08:51.924 --> 02:08:53.959
AND PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES

02:08:54.026 --> 02:08:55.961
THERE CAN ALSO BE SEEN. MATTER

02:08:56.028 --> 02:08:58.263
EMBARRASSED SO UP THERE OVER

02:08:58.330 --> 02:09:02.968
THE- THAT MATCH I INCOME LIMITS

02:09:03.035 --> 02:09:04.336
THEY CAN ALSO BE IN THERE BUT

02:09:04.403 --> 02:09:06.505
THE MAJORITY ARE OUR SENIORS

02:09:06.572 --> 02:09:08.207
AND PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES

02:09:08.273 --> 02:09:09.942
WELL WE CAN CERTAINLY WORK

02:09:10.008 --> 02:09:11.477
THOSE NUMBERS CREDIT IT'S A

02:09:11.543 --> 02:09:14.246
COMBINATION OF THE COVERAGE

02:09:14.313 --> 02:09:17.382
GROUPS THAT WE COVER IN THE

02:09:17.449 --> 02:09:21.286
MORNING OUR PROBLEM- SO. THE

02:09:21.353 --> 02:09:23.722
TIMING OF MAKING ANY CHANGES TO

02:09:23.789 --> 02:09:26.792
THE ASSET TEST- YOU KNOW WE'RE

02:09:26.859 --> 02:09:27.993
WE'RE LOOKING AT THREE

02:09:28.060 --> 02:09:29.228
DIFFERENT ELIGIBILITY SYSTEMS

02:09:29.294 --> 02:09:33.532
MOVE INTO A SINGLE SYSTEM- WE

02:09:33.599 --> 02:09:34.600
THOUGHT WE HEARD YOU SAY WE

02:09:34.666 --> 02:09:36.702
COULDN'T DE CHANGE WHAT'S AN

02:09:36.768 --> 02:09:38.237
ASSET VERSUS WHAT'S NOT AN

02:09:38.303 --> 02:09:39.771
ASSET BECAUSE OF THE SARS

02:09:39.838 --> 02:09:42.708
MIGRATION UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY

02:09:42.774 --> 02:09:44.576
FOUR CAN YOU RE EXPLAIN THAT OR

02:09:44.643 --> 02:09:47.746
DID WE- HEAR THAT WRONG. NO SO

02:09:47.813 --> 02:09:48.914
YOU'RE HEARD THAT CORRECTLY SO

02:09:48.981 --> 02:09:50.549
AT THE TIME THAT WE HAD

02:09:50.616 --> 02:09:52.584
CONTAINED THE ESTIMATES ON THAT

02:09:52.651 --> 02:09:54.753
SONG. I'M IN IN TERMS OF

02:09:54.820 --> 02:09:56.555
LOOKING AT A TIMELINE FOR WHEN

02:09:56.622 --> 02:09:59.591
THEY COULD MAKE THOSE CHANGES-

02:09:59.658 --> 02:10:01.727
THOSE WOULD BE CHANGES AND THAT

02:10:01.793 --> 02:10:02.761
WAS THE ESTIMATE THAT WAS

02:10:02.828 --> 02:10:05.230
PROVIDED TO US IN TERMS OF HOW

02:10:05.297 --> 02:10:06.632
WE WERE LOOKING AT MAKING THE

02:10:06.698 --> 02:10:10.002
CHANGES. TO THE ASSET LIMIT SO-

02:10:10.068 --> 02:10:11.770
WE TEND TO WORK WE DO WORK WITH

02:10:11.837 --> 02:10:13.572
OUR OUR SAAS PARTNERS IN TERMS

02:10:13.639 --> 02:10:15.874
OF COMING UP WITH THE ESTIMATES

02:10:15.941 --> 02:10:18.076
FOR WHEN WE MAKE THESE CHANGES-

02:10:18.143 --> 02:10:19.778
BUT AGAIN I THINK WHICH

02:10:19.845 --> 02:10:21.413
ANYTHING THAT COMES THROUGH THE

02:10:21.480 --> 02:10:24.149
LEGISLATURE. THEN IF IT IS A

02:10:24.216 --> 02:10:30.355
POLICY. THAT IS- THEN WE HAVE

02:10:30.422 --> 02:10:32.391
HAVE THIS ON THE TIME I THINK

02:10:32.457 --> 02:10:35.994
WE HAVE ALL SHARE. OF WITH- LED.

02:10:36.061 --> 02:10:38.630
AS SOME OF THE COMPLEXITY. WITH

02:10:38.697 --> 02:10:40.065
MAKING CHANGES GIVEN THE TIMING

02:10:40.132 --> 02:10:41.266
OF WHERE WE'RE OUT WITH THE

02:10:41.333 --> 02:10:43.835
SYSTEM MIGRATION SO THERE MAY

02:10:43.902 --> 02:10:45.871
BE OTHER PRIORITIES THAT THEY

02:10:45.938 --> 02:10:47.139
DO HAVE IN THE QUEUE THAT WOULD

02:10:47.206 --> 02:10:49.308
HAVE TO THEN BE. ACCOUNTED FOR

02:10:49.374 --> 02:10:51.176
IN DECISIONS WHAT HAVE WE NEED

02:10:51.243 --> 02:10:53.545
IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW WHAT FOR

02:10:53.612 --> 02:10:55.280
DO THEY CONTINUE TO ADVANCE

02:10:55.347 --> 02:10:56.481
SOMETIMES IT'S NOT THIS WOULD

02:10:56.548 --> 02:10:59.284
BE WORK. THAT IS NOT- BEEN

02:10:59.351 --> 02:11:01.320
CONTEMPLATED SO THEY WOULD HAVE

02:11:01.386 --> 02:11:03.121
TO FACTOR IN IF THERE WAS AN

02:11:03.188 --> 02:11:05.090
ABILITY TO DO ANYTHING OUR

02:11:05.157 --> 02:11:08.227
TEAM. TWENTY TWENTY FOUR ONE-

02:11:08.293 --> 02:11:12.965
MIGRATION HAVE BEEN. BEEN

02:11:13.031 --> 02:11:14.333
COMPLETE. SO RE. OF WHETHER

02:11:14.399 --> 02:11:15.667
THERE'S LARGE. HERE ASKING THE

02:11:15.734 --> 02:11:19.371
CHANGED THE SOONEST WE COULD-EXPECT A CHANGE MAYBE EVEN

02:11:19.438 --> 02:11:21.173
POSSIBLY THE ELIMINATION OF THE

02:11:21.240 --> 02:11:23.141
ASSET TEST IS TWENTY TWENTY

02:11:23.208 --> 02:11:23.675
FOUR. IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE

02:11:23.742 --> 02:11:26.778
SAYING. WELL I THINK THAT. SO

02:11:26.845 --> 02:11:28.247
BASED UPON THE DECISION THAT'S

02:11:28.313 --> 02:11:31.083
ME MORE THEN WHAT WOULD THEN BE

02:11:31.149 --> 02:11:32.684
USED TO INFORM WHAT THOSE

02:11:32.751 --> 02:11:33.685
DISCUSSIONS WILL BE WHAT'S

02:11:33.752 --> 02:11:35.554
SAUCE IN TERMS OF WHAT THEIR

02:11:35.621 --> 02:11:37.322
CAPABILITIES ARE THEY ALREADY

02:11:37.389 --> 02:11:41.393
HAVE. A FULL LIST OF POLICIES

02:11:41.460 --> 02:11:42.561
THAT THEY ARE CURRENTLY WORKING

02:11:42.628 --> 02:11:44.863
ON AND SO THIS WOULD BE A NEW

02:11:44.930 --> 02:11:46.465
POLICY AND CHANGE THAT WHAT

02:11:46.531 --> 02:11:48.867
HAPPENED THEN BE ACCOUNTED FOR.

02:11:48.934 --> 02:11:49.901
AND THEN THEY WOULD HAVE TO

02:11:49.968 --> 02:11:53.505
IDENTIFY WHAT THE- AVAILABILITY

02:11:53.572 --> 02:11:56.208
IS TO MAKE THE CHANGE PRIOR TO

02:11:56.275 --> 02:12:00.045
THE ESTIMATED TIMELINE THAT

02:12:00.112 --> 02:12:01.280
THEY PROVIDE. I THE TIME WHEN

02:12:01.346 --> 02:12:04.950

CELLS WITH COMPLEXITY AND- AND

02:12:20.532 --> 02:12:22.734
SO ON I MEAN I THINK JUST THE

02:12:22.801 --> 02:12:24.136
COMPLEXITY THAT'S NEEDED TO

JUST REALIZE IT'S BEEN

02:15:16.174 --> 02:15:17.409
MENTIONED BEFORE IT HASN'T

02:15:17.476 --> 02:15:18.844
SERIOUSLY BEEN REVISITED SINCE

02:15:18.910 --> 02:15:20.579
THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES. YET OUR

02:15:20.645 --> 02:15:22.180
VIEWS ON HOW TO BEST RUN HEALTH

02:15:22.247 --> 02:15:23.815

02:15:25.884 --> 02:15:26.718
CHANGED DRAMATICALLY SINCE

02:15:26.785 --> 02:15:29.855
THEN- KATHY SANDERLING SPOKE A

02:15:29.921 --> 02:15:31.056
LITTLE BIT BEFORE ABOUT THEIR

02:15:31.122 --> 02:15:32.090
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE

02:15:32.157 --> 02:15:33.525
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND HOW

02:15:33.592 --> 02:15:34.826
THAT AFFECTED ELIGIBILITY FOR

02:15:34.893 --> 02:15:36.394
MEDICARE. BUT I'D ALSO LIKE TO

02:15:36.461 --> 02:15:37.796
FOCUS ON HOW THAT AFFECTED THE

02:15:37.863 --> 02:15:39.598
MEDIC HOW PROCESS SEES. THERE

02:15:39.664 --> 02:15:41.633
WAS A DRAMATIC SHIFT IN HOW WE

02:15:41.700 --> 02:15:42.834
DETERMINE WHETHER SOMEONE WAS

02:15:42.901 --> 02:15:44.569
ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE FOR MOST

02:15:44.636 --> 02:15:46.071
THE PEOPLE IN THESE PROGRAMS.

02:15:46.137 --> 02:15:47.839
PREVIOUSLY WE WERE RELIANT ON

02:15:47.906 --> 02:15:49.407
SEMI ANNUAL STATUS REPORTS

02:15:49.474 --> 02:15:51.543
PROOFS OF RESIDENCY DISABILITY

02:15:51.610 --> 02:15:53.545
DETERMINATIONS. AND WE MOVED TO

02:15:53.612 --> 02:15:55.280
A SYSTEM THAT BEGAN TO RELY

02:15:55.347 --> 02:15:57.048
MORE AND MORE ON USING

02:15:57.115 --> 02:15:59.017
ELECTRONIC DATABASES. AND

02:15:59.084 --> 02:16:00.352
REALLY TRYING TO DO EVERYTHING

02:16:00.418 --> 02:16:01.953
MORE ON THE BACK AND RATHER

02:16:02.020 --> 02:16:03.488
THAN ASKING THE APPLICANT TO

02:16:03.555 --> 02:16:04.656
PROVE UP EVERYTHING ON THE

02:16:04.723 --> 02:16:07.092
FRONT EDGE- THIS AFFECTED NOT

02:16:07.158 --> 02:16:08.460
JUST APPLICATIONS BUT ALSO

02:16:08.527 --> 02:16:10.662
RENEWALS. SO FOR AN EXAMPLE OF

02:16:10.729 --> 02:16:12.898
THAT- IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

02:16:12.964 --> 02:16:15.233
THE MATCH I POPULATION WHO

02:16:15.300 --> 02:16:15.767
ISN'T SUBJECT TO THE ASSET

02:16:15.834 --> 02:16:18.603
TEST. UPWARDS OF 50% OF THEM

02:16:18.670 --> 02:16:20.071
ARE ABLE TO RENEW THEIR MEDIC

02:16:20.138 --> 02:16:21.306
HOW EVERY YEAR WITHOUT DOING

02:16:21.373 --> 02:16:23.041
ANYTHING. THE COUNTY WORKERS

02:16:23.108 --> 02:16:24.409
ARE ABLE TO CHECK ELECTRONIC

02:16:24.476 --> 02:16:26.077
DATABASES VERIFY THAT THEY'RE

02:16:26.144 --> 02:16:27.646
STILL ELIGIBLE AND THEN SEND

02:16:27.712 --> 02:16:29.848
THEM A NOTICE. SAYING THIS IS

02:16:29.915 --> 02:16:31.383
WHAT WE FOUND LET US KNOW IF

02:16:31.449 --> 02:16:32.984
THERE ANY CORRECTIONS IF NOT.

02:16:33.051 --> 02:16:35.887
YOU'RE GOOD TO GO- THIS DOESN'T

02:16:35.954 --> 02:16:37.255
HAPPEN FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE

02:16:37.322 --> 02:16:39.357
SUBJECT TO THE ASSETS TEST. AND

02:16:39.424 --> 02:16:40.492
SO PART OF WHAT CAUSED THE

02:16:40.559 --> 02:16:41.927
DRAMATIC INCREASE IN MEDIC CAL

02:16:41.993 --> 02:16:44.062
AND ROMANCE IN TWENTY FOURTEEN

02:16:44.129 --> 02:16:45.497
WASN'T JUST THE NEWLY ELIGIBLE

02:16:45.564 --> 02:16:46.765
BUT IT WAS THOSE WHO HAD BEEN

02:16:46.831 --> 02:16:48.833
ELIGIBLE ALL ALONG WHO CAN NOW.

02:16:48.900 --> 02:16:51.069
MORE EASILY GET ON MEDI CAL WE

02:16:51.136 --> 02:16:52.804
REFER TO THIS PHENOMENON AS THE

02:16:52.871 --> 02:16:56.374
WELCOME MATS AND I'M OUT AND

02:16:56.441 --> 02:16:57.042
ABOUT IN MEDICARE. FOR THOSE TO

02:16:57.108 --> 02:16:58.176
THAT TEST THOUGH WE QUITE

02:16:58.243 --> 02:17:00.111
ROLLED OUT THEN WELCOME MAT.

02:17:00.178 --> 02:17:01.580
IT'S STILL HARD TO GET AND STAY

02:17:01.646 --> 02:17:02.847
ON MEDICARE OUT AS THEY HAVE

02:17:02.914 --> 02:17:04.316
TOGETHER RECENT BANK ACCOUNT

02:17:04.382 --> 02:17:05.483
STATEMENTS THEY HAVE TO HAVE

02:17:05.550 --> 02:17:06.651
PROPERTY VALUE WOULD BE THAT

02:17:06.718 --> 02:17:07.586
THEY HAVE TO PROVE WHAT THEY

02:17:07.652 --> 02:17:09.321
OWN. AND IN SOME CASES WHAT

02:17:09.387 --> 02:17:11.523
THEY NO LONGER OWNED- ONE OF

02:17:11.590 --> 02:17:12.958
THE THINGS THAT HASN'T BEEN

02:17:13.024 --> 02:17:14.259
DISCUSSED HERE IS AS LONG AS

02:17:14.326 --> 02:17:14.926
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

02:17:14.993 --> 02:17:16.394
CONTINUES TO HAVE AN ASSETS

02:17:16.461 --> 02:17:18.997
TEST. THEY'RE ALSO REQUIRED- BY

02:17:19.064 --> 02:17:20.031
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO

02:17:20.098 --> 02:17:21.967
CONDUCT AUDITS OF BENEFICIARIES

02:17:22.033 --> 02:17:22.934
TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE NOT

02:17:23.001 --> 02:17:24.869
LYING ABOUT THEIR ASSETS. SO

02:17:24.936 --> 02:17:26.004
THERE WOULD ALSO BE AN

02:17:26.071 --> 02:17:29.307
ADMINISTRATIVE SAVINGS- TO NOT

02:17:29.374 --> 02:17:30.442
HAVE TO ENGAGE IN ALL THE

02:17:30.508 --> 02:17:32.644
PROGRAMS THAT ALLOW THEM TO DO

02:17:32.711 --> 02:17:34.312
THAT AUDIT. I WOULD ALSO

02:17:34.379 --> 02:17:35.880
MENTION THAT POLICYMAKERS IN

02:17:35.947 --> 02:17:37.282
CALIFORNIA HAVE TAKEN

02:17:37.349 --> 02:17:39.050
CONSIDERABLE EFFORTS TO PROMOTE

02:17:39.117 --> 02:17:40.685
SAVINGS IN OTHER ARENAS.

02:17:40.752 --> 02:17:41.720
INCLUDING THROUGH THE NEW CAL

02:17:41.786 --> 02:17:43.955
SAVERS RETIREMENT SYSTEM FOR

02:17:44.022 --> 02:17:44.589
PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE A

02:17:44.656 --> 02:17:46.157
RETIREMENT SAVINGS. SAVINGS

02:17:46.224 --> 02:17:47.993
OPTIONS THROUGH WORK. ON THE

02:17:48.059 --> 02:17:49.127
OTHER HAND THOUGH FOR THIS

02:17:49.194 --> 02:17:50.829
GROUP OF PEOPLE AND MEDIC HAL.

02:17:50.895 --> 02:17:52.664
THEY'RE ACTUALLY PENALIZED WHEN

02:17:52.731 --> 02:17:54.132
THEY DON'T START THAT DEPLETING

02:17:54.199 --> 02:17:55.767
THEIR RETIREMENT JUST AS SOON

02:17:55.834 --> 02:17:57.235
AS THEY'RE ELIGIBLE.

02:17:57.302 --> 02:17:59.237
UNFORTUNATELY BY NOT REVISITING

02:17:59.304 --> 02:18:00.572
THE ROLE WE FURTHER INGRAINED

02:18:00.639 --> 02:18:02.474
INTO OUR MEDIC HEALTH SYSTEM A

02:18:02.540 --> 02:18:04.242
RULE THAT PERPETUATE STRUCTURAL

02:18:04.309 --> 02:18:06.244
RACISM BOTH BY WHO GETS ON THE

02:18:06.311 --> 02:18:08.913
PROGRAM. AND BY THE SACRIFICES

02:18:08.980 --> 02:18:09.514
THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE EXPECTED

02:18:09.581 --> 02:18:12.617
TO MAKE. AS AN EXAMPLE ONE OF

02:18:12.684 --> 02:18:14.286
OUR LOS ANGELES PARTNERS HELP A

02:18:14.352 --> 02:18:15.654
WOMAN WHO NEEDED MEDICARE

02:18:15.720 --> 02:18:17.422
BECAUSE OUR TEETH WERE ROTTING.

02:18:17.489 --> 02:18:18.957
SHE WAS UNABLE TO GET MEDIC HOW

02:18:19.024 --> 02:18:20.358
BECAUSE SHE HAD TOO MUCH MONEY

02:18:20.425 --> 02:18:21.993
IN HER BANK ACCOUNT. BUT THE

02:18:22.060 --> 02:18:23.395
REASON THAT SHE HAD TOO MUCH

02:18:23.461 --> 02:18:24.796
MONEY IN HER BANK ACCOUNT IS

02:18:24.863 --> 02:18:25.797
BECAUSE HER HUSBAND HAD

02:18:25.864 --> 02:18:27.532
TERMINAL CANCER AND SHE WAS

02:18:27.599 --> 02:18:29.167
SAVING MONEY TO PAY FOR HIS

02:18:29.234 --> 02:18:31.336
FUNERAL COSTS. SHE WAS UNABLE

02:18:31.403 --> 02:18:32.570
TO BRING HERSELF TO SPEND DOWN

02:18:32.637 --> 02:18:34.172
THE MONEY EVEN ON HER OWN

02:18:34.239 --> 02:18:35.940
DENTAL NEEDS. SO SHE WENT

02:18:36.007 --> 02:18:38.109
WITHOUT DENTAL CARE. WHEN YOU

02:18:38.176 --> 02:18:39.944
NEED PUBLIC ASSISTANCE DURING A

02:18:40.011 --> 02:18:41.713
PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT TIME IN

02:18:41.780 --> 02:18:43.782
LIFE. THE INABILITY TO ACCESS

02:18:43.848 --> 02:18:45.183
IT BECAUSE YOU DO NOT MEET THE

02:18:45.250 --> 02:18:47.118
PROGRAM CRITERIA FEELS DEEPLY

02:18:47.185 --> 02:18:48.920
PERSONAL. YOU FEEL THAT THE

02:18:48.987 --> 02:18:50.188
SYSTEM HAS JUDGE THE

02:18:50.255 --> 02:18:51.156
CIRCUMSTANCES YOU FOUND

02:18:51.222 --> 02:18:52.691
YOURSELF IN AND DEEMED YOU

02:18:52.757 --> 02:18:54.759
UNWORTHY OF ASSISTANCE. THIS

02:18:54.826 --> 02:18:56.428
INDIVIDUAL FELT THE DENIAL OF

02:18:56.494 --> 02:18:58.196
MEDIKAL SHOULD THE SYSTEMS AND

02:18:58.263 --> 02:18:59.864
DIFFERENCE TO HER HUSBAND'S

02:18:59.931 --> 02:19:00.365
WORSENING HEALTH AND HIS

02:19:00.432 --> 02:19:03.268
ULTIMATE. NOW THAT COUNTY

02:19:03.334 --> 02:19:04.602
SANDERLING MENTIONED BEFORE THE

02:19:04.669 --> 02:19:05.470
IDEA THAT THERE ARE

02:19:05.537 --> 02:19:07.005
MILLIONAIRES WITHOUT INCOME

02:19:07.072 --> 02:19:08.339
WAITING TO GET ON MEDICARE HOW

02:19:08.406 --> 02:19:10.475
IS A BIT OF A UNICORN. AND I

02:19:10.542 --> 02:19:12.177
COMPLETELY AGREE WITH THAT

02:19:12.243 --> 02:19:14.813
HOWEVER IF ANYONE IS ABLE TO

02:19:14.879 --> 02:19:16.181
GET AROUND THE MEDIC HOW ASSETS

02:19:16.247 --> 02:19:17.716
TEST IT'S GOING TO BE SOMEBODY

02:19:17.782 --> 02:19:19.684
WHO'S WEALTHIER WHICH TYPICALLY

02:19:19.751 --> 02:19:21.753
MEANS SOMEBODY WHO'S WIDER. AND

02:19:21.820 --> 02:19:22.754
THEY'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET

02:19:22.821 --> 02:19:24.089
AROUND IT BY KNOWING WHICH

02:19:24.155 --> 02:19:25.790
BURIAL INSURANCE WITH NO CASH

02:19:25.857 --> 02:19:27.325
SURRENDER VALUE MIGHT WORK FOR

02:19:27.392 --> 02:19:29.461
THEM. OR IF THEY CAN WORK WITH

02:19:29.527 --> 02:19:30.829
A FAMILY MEMBER TO SET UP AN

02:19:30.895 --> 02:19:32.297
ABLE ACCOUNT TO PAY FOR THEIR

02:19:32.363 --> 02:19:33.465
NEEDS IS THERE A PERSON WITH A

02:19:33.531 --> 02:19:35.100
DISABILITY. OR THEY CAN

02:19:35.166 --> 02:19:37.135
PURCHASE OTHER EXEMPT ASSETS OR

02:19:37.202 --> 02:19:38.303
THEY CAN DO THINGS TO BUSINESS

02:19:38.369 --> 02:19:40.271
ASSETS. THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO

02:19:40.338 --> 02:19:41.239
HAVE THAT KIND OF ACCESS OR

02:19:41.306 --> 02:19:42.474
PEOPLE WHO HAVE ACCESS TO

02:19:42.540 --> 02:19:44.309
ESTATE PLANNING ATTORNEYS OR TO

02:19:44.375 --> 02:19:46.711
OTHER INFORMATION BECAUSE MUST

02:19:46.778 --> 02:19:48.513
CHECK THIS IS IN REGULATIONS.

02:19:48.580 --> 02:19:49.481
SOME OF IT IS EVEN AND

02:19:49.547 --> 02:19:50.949
REGULATIONS THAT ARE NOT

02:19:51.015 --> 02:19:52.317
CODIFIED SO YOU HAVE TO GO

02:19:52.384 --> 02:19:53.184
THROUGH SIGNIFICANT AGENCY

02:19:53.251 --> 02:19:54.953
GUIDANCE TO UNDERSTAND HOW

02:19:55.019 --> 02:19:58.189
THESE RULES WORK AND HOW YOU

02:19:58.256 --> 02:19:59.457
CAN BEST UTILIZE THEM.

02:19:59.524 --> 02:20:00.391
FURTHERMORE THE MEDIC HOW

02:20:00.458 --> 02:20:02.227
ASSETS TEST IS ANOTHER WHAT WAY

02:20:02.293 --> 02:20:04.162
ARE LAWS STRUCTURALLY DEPRIVE

02:20:04.229 --> 02:20:06.097
COMMUNITIES OF COLOR OF WEALTH.

02:20:06.164 --> 02:20:07.899
EVEN IF A BENEFICIARY SUBJECT

02:20:07.966 --> 02:20:09.534
TO THE TEST WANTED TO SAVE THEY

02:20:09.601 --> 02:20:11.302
COULDN'T. FOR FEAR OF LOSING

02:20:11.369 --> 02:20:13.138
THEIR HEALTH CARE. THEY CAN'T

02:20:13.204 --> 02:20:14.339
SAVE FOR THINGS THEY KNOW THEY

02:20:14.405 --> 02:20:16.708
NEED I SPOKE TO AN INDIVIDUAL

02:20:16.775 --> 02:20:18.510
THIS SUMMER IN LONG BEACH. BUT

02:20:18.576 --> 02:20:19.944
AS TO HOW THE ASSETS HAS HARMED

02:20:20.011 --> 02:20:22.046
HIM AND HE MENTIONED TO ME THAT

02:20:22.113 --> 02:20:23.281
HE WANTED TO VISIT HIS OWN

02:20:23.348 --> 02:20:24.783
FATHER WHO LIVED OUT BEYOND BIG

02:20:24.849 --> 02:20:27.452
BEAR OR HIS NEPHEWS THAT LIVE

02:20:27.519 --> 02:20:28.219
ON THE PAHLAVAS AVACEN YOU'RE

02:20:28.286 --> 02:20:30.021
DOING. THERE'S NO PUBLIC

02:20:30.088 --> 02:20:31.055
TRANSPORTATION OR WAY TO GET

02:20:31.122 --> 02:20:32.957
THERE SO THE ONLY WAY FOR HIM

02:20:33.024 --> 02:20:34.192
TO GET HIMSELF THERE WOULD BE

02:20:34.259 --> 02:20:36.327
IF YOU CAN DRIVE. HOWEVER

02:20:36.394 --> 02:20:38.329
BECAUSE HE NEEDS A VAN THAT

02:20:38.396 --> 02:20:40.765
SPECIALLY OUTFITTED TO

02:20:40.832 --> 02:20:42.066
ACCOMMODATE HIS WHEELCHAIR. HE

02:20:42.133 --> 02:20:44.435
CAN'T GET THERE HE USED TO HAVE

02:20:44.502 --> 02:20:45.503
ONE OF THESE BANDS BUT EVER

02:20:45.570 --> 02:20:47.305
SINCE THAT BAND BROKE DOWN HE

02:20:47.372 --> 02:20:48.907
HAS NOT BEEN ALLOWED TO SAVE

02:20:48.973 --> 02:20:51.009
ENOUGH MONEY TO GET ANOTHER ONE

02:20:51.075 --> 02:20:54.012
TO REPLACE IT. SO HE HE JUST

02:20:54.078 --> 02:20:55.013
CAN'T SAVE THE MONEY FOR THE

02:20:55.079 --> 02:20:57.048
THINGS WE NEED- AND WE HEAR

02:20:57.115 --> 02:20:58.216
COUNTLESS EXAMPLES OF PEOPLE

02:20:58.283 --> 02:20:59.484
NOT BEING ABLE TO SAVE TO

02:20:59.551 --> 02:21:01.786
REPLACE THE ROOF- NOT BEING

02:21:01.853 --> 02:21:03.054
ABLE TO SAVE IN THE EVENT OF AN

02:21:03.121 --> 02:21:04.789
ADDICTION. OR ALL SORTS OF

02:21:04.856 --> 02:21:05.456
OTHER THINGS THAT PEOPLE

02:21:05.523 --> 02:21:08.193
ACTUALLY NEED TO SAVE FOR- WHEN

02:21:08.259 --> 02:21:09.727
I ASKED HIM HOW HE THIS MADE

02:21:09.794 --> 02:21:13.064
HIM FEEL HE ASKED ME IF I KNEW

02:21:13.131 --> 02:21:14.299
WHAT THE WORD INDENTURED ME.

02:21:14.365 --> 02:21:16.234
AFTER SAID YES HE SAID WELL.

02:21:16.301 --> 02:21:18.236
THE IT MEDIC HOW MAKES ME AND

02:21:18.303 --> 02:21:19.103
MY FRIENDS ARE ON IT FEEL

02:21:19.170 --> 02:21:20.939
INDENTURED. IT'S LIKE WE NEED

02:21:21.005 --> 02:21:22.807
TO ASK FOR PERMISSION ON HOW TO

02:21:22.874 --> 02:21:27.045
LIVE OUR LIVES- SO IT. IN CLOSE

02:21:27.111 --> 02:21:28.279
THERE'S NO OTHER FORM OF HEALTH

02:21:28.346 --> 02:21:30.014
CARE AVAILABLE IN CALIFORNIA

02:21:30.081 --> 02:21:31.216
INCLUDING THE REST OF THE

02:21:31.282 --> 02:21:33.151
MEDICARE PROGRAM AND SUBSIDIES

02:21:33.218 --> 02:21:34.152
AVAILABLE THROUGH COVERED

02:21:34.219 --> 02:21:35.954
CALIFORNIA. THAT REQUIRES AN

02:21:36.020 --> 02:21:37.288
INDIVIDUAL TO DOCUMENT A

02:21:37.355 --> 02:21:39.224
COMPLETE ACCOUNTING OF THEIR

02:21:39.290 --> 02:21:41.459
ASSETS EVERY YEAR- POTENTIALLY

02:21:41.526 --> 02:21:42.961
AUDITS THEIR ASSETS AND LIMITS

02:21:43.027 --> 02:21:45.230
HOW THEY CAN SAVE. EXCEPT FOR

02:21:45.296 --> 02:21:46.030
THIS PART OF THE MEDICARE

02:21:46.097 --> 02:21:48.466
PROGRAM. THE CRUEL IRONY IS THE

02:21:48.533 --> 02:21:49.868
ONLY PEOPLE SUBJECT TO THIS

02:21:49.934 --> 02:21:51.269
RULE ARE THOSE THAT HAVE LITTLE

02:21:51.336 --> 02:21:52.537
TO BEGIN WITH AND THE LEAST

02:21:52.604 --> 02:21:54.138
ABILITY TO INCREASE THEIR

02:21:54.205 --> 02:21:56.574
ASSETS. MOST OF THE PEOPLE IN

02:21:56.641 --> 02:21:58.243
THE ASIAN DISABLED PROGRAM ARE

02:21:58.309 --> 02:21:59.944
ACTUALLY ON FIXED INCOMES

02:22:00.011 --> 02:22:02.113
THEY'RE OUT OF THE WORK FORCE

02:22:02.180 --> 02:22:03.014
OR WILL SOON BE LIVING THE WORK

02:22:03.081 --> 02:22:05.617
FORCE. IT'S PAST TIME WE STOP

02:22:05.683 --> 02:22:07.418
THE INEQUITY PERPETUATED BY

02:22:07.485 --> 02:22:09.153
THIS OUTDATED RULE AND REPEAL

02:22:09.220 --> 02:22:11.723
IT ENTIRELY. AND THEN FINALLY

02:22:11.789 --> 02:22:14.893
IT JUST TO AREAS- OF COST.

02:22:14.959 --> 02:22:17.662
SAVINGS THAT MAY BE THERE- FOR

02:22:17.729 --> 02:22:18.730
ONE THING WE APPRECIATE THE

02:22:18.796 --> 02:22:20.531
WORK THAT DH CS DID IN COMING

02:22:20.598 --> 02:22:21.766
UP WITH COST ESTIMATES AND WE

02:22:21.833 --> 02:22:23.101
RECOGNIZE HOW MUCH OF THIS IS

02:22:23.167 --> 02:22:24.936
COMPLETELY SPECULATIVE. TRYING

02:22:25.003 --> 02:22:26.371
TO FIGURE OUT HOW MANY PEOPLE

02:22:26.437 --> 02:22:28.339
WITH SUCH LOW INCOMES HAVE

02:22:28.406 --> 02:22:29.741
ASSETS AT ALL IN CALIFORNIA IS

02:22:29.807 --> 02:22:32.710
A CHALLENGE- BUT ONE AREA THAT

02:22:32.777 --> 02:22:34.979
WE FEEL THAT THE COST MAY BE

02:22:35.046 --> 02:22:36.547
SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT IS

02:22:36.614 --> 02:22:38.149
AROUND THE I. HSS COSTS THE IN

02:22:38.216 --> 02:22:40.084
HOME SUPPORTIVE SERVICES COST-

02:22:40.151 --> 02:22:41.653
AND YOU'LL SEE THAT IS. THE

02:22:41.719 --> 02:22:43.488
BIGGEST FACTOR IN THE EXPENSE

02:22:43.554 --> 02:22:45.356
FOR THIS BUT OUR EXPERIENCE AS

02:22:45.423 --> 02:22:47.225
LEGAL SERVICES ADVOCATES HAS

02:22:47.292 --> 02:22:48.626
BEEN THAT PEOPLE WHO NEED I.

02:22:48.693 --> 02:22:51.062
HSS- TEND TO GET ON THE PROGRAM

02:22:51.129 --> 02:22:52.263
FASTER THAN OTHERS BECAUSE THEY

02:22:52.330 --> 02:22:54.165
HAVE SUCH SEVERE MEDICAL NEEDS.

02:22:54.232 --> 02:22:55.700
THE OTHER AREA HAS BEEN TALKED

02:22:55.767 --> 02:22:56.701
ABOUT A BIT WHICH SIZE

02:22:56.768 --> 02:22:58.403
MIGRATION IF WE ACTUALLY ARE

02:22:58.469 --> 02:23:00.505
ABLE TO IMPLEMENT. THIS RULE

02:23:00.571 --> 02:23:02.106
AND TELL SAW'S MIGRATION IS

02:23:02.173 --> 02:23:03.908
COMPLETE THEN WE WOULDN'T BE

02:23:03.975 --> 02:23:04.809
PAYING FOR THREE DIFFERENT

02:23:04.876 --> 02:23:09.047
SYSTEMS TO IMPLEMENT IT SO

02:23:09.113 --> 02:23:09.614
THERE MAY ALSO BE A SAVINGS

02:23:09.681 --> 02:23:11.950
THERE- SO THAT'S ALL I HAVE

02:23:12.016 --> 02:23:13.217
RIGHT NOW I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER

02:23:13.284 --> 02:23:14.886
ANY QUESTIONS BUT I STRONGLY

02:23:14.953 --> 02:23:17.322
ENCOURAGE- ALL THE MEMBERS OF

02:23:17.388 --> 02:23:18.656
THIS LEGISLATURE AND THIS

02:23:18.723 --> 02:23:19.857
ADMINISTRATION TO HIGHLY

02:23:19.924 --> 02:23:21.659
PRIORITIZE. ELIMINATING THE

02:23:21.726 --> 02:23:23.394
ASSETS TEST IT'S ONE OF THOSE

02:23:23.461 --> 02:23:24.996
THINGS THAT EVERYBODY TENDS TO

02:23:25.063 --> 02:23:26.798
AGREE WITH. BUT UNLESS PEOPLE

02:23:26.864 --> 02:23:28.533
START PUTTING IT AS A PRIORITY

02:23:28.599 --> 02:23:29.567
THAT THIS IS WHERE WE SHOULD

02:23:29.634 --> 02:23:31.903
SPEND STATE DOLLARS IT'S NOT

02:23:31.970 --> 02:23:33.771
GOING TO HAPPEN. THANK YOU.

02:23:33.838 --> 02:23:34.706
THANK YOU MISS FOR IT WILL GO

02:23:34.772 --> 02:23:35.840
AHEAD AND MOVE ON TO CLEAR AT

02:23:35.907 --> 02:23:36.874
THIS POINT AND THEN WILL ASK

02:23:36.941 --> 02:23:39.077
QUESTIONS JOINTLY A FEW OF THE

02:23:39.143 --> 02:23:44.148

WITH JUSTICE IN AGING. AGING IS

02:23:51.122 --> 02:23:53.558
A NATIONAL LEGAL NONPROFIT THAT

USES THE POWER OF WATER FIGHT

AND ON HSS AND OTHER HOME AND

02:24:07.005 --> 02:24:07.438
COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES

02:24:07.505 --> 02:24:09.273
PROGRAM. I WANT TO THANK YOU

02:24:09.340 --> 02:24:11.209
ALL. YOUR STRONG VALUE BASE

02:24:11.275 --> 02:24:13.311
SUPPORT PROTECTING THOSE

02:24:13.378 --> 02:24:15.546
PROBLEMS- AND I REALLY WANT TO

02:24:15.613 --> 02:24:17.382
FOCUS MY TESTIMONY ON THE WAYS

02:24:17.448 --> 02:24:18.750
IN WHICH THE MEDICAID ASSET

02:24:18.816 --> 02:24:21.519
LIMIT WORKS AGAINST OUR VALUES

02:24:21.586 --> 02:24:22.687
TO BUILD A CALIFORNIA FOR ALL.

02:24:22.754 --> 02:24:24.455
I'M GONNA DO THAT SORT OF BY

02:24:24.522 --> 02:24:26.391
FOCUSING ON. FIRST THE WAY WE

02:24:26.457 --> 02:24:30.828
CAN FIGHT RIGHT ENOUGH. THAT'S

02:24:30.895 --> 02:24:31.896
NOT HOW IT POVERTY SEEN AND

02:24:31.963 --> 02:24:33.297
PEOPLE WITH THIS. AND THEN HOW

02:24:33.364 --> 02:24:34.699
IT SUSTAINS THIS POP AND YOU'VE

02:24:34.766 --> 02:24:35.833
HEARD SOME OF THIS BUT I REALLY

02:24:35.900 --> 02:24:37.869
WANT TO- GIVE YOU SOME EXAMPLES

02:24:37.935 --> 02:24:42.273
OF HOW THAT OPENS. UP FIRST.

02:24:42.340 --> 02:24:43.441
WITH REGARD CHIU RATIONS EXCUSE

02:24:43.508 --> 02:24:44.876
ME PERPETUATING IN WIDENING

02:24:44.942 --> 02:24:47.278
RACIAL INEQUALITY- YOU KNOW THE

02:24:47.345 --> 02:24:49.047
ASSET LIMIT APPEARS TO BE RACE

02:24:49.113 --> 02:24:52.450
NEUTRAL AND SOMETIMES WERE

02:24:52.517 --> 02:24:54.285
VERY- QUICK TO OVERLOOK THOSE

02:24:54.352 --> 02:24:55.753
TYPES OF POLICIES POLICIES WHEN

02:24:55.820 --> 02:24:58.823
IT COMES TO REALLY. ELIMINATING

02:24:58.890 --> 02:25:00.925
INEQUALITY IN THE STATE BUT THE

02:25:00.992 --> 02:25:02.960
REASON THAT THIS MEDICARE RULE

02:25:03.027 --> 02:25:04.529
IS CREATING MORE OFFICIAL

02:25:04.595 --> 02:25:06.464
INEQUALITY IS BECAUSE WE TREAT

02:25:06.531 --> 02:25:08.232
DIFFERENT ASSETS DIFFERENTLY.

02:25:08.299 --> 02:25:11.269
AND SPECIFICALLY UNDER CURRENT

02:25:11.335 --> 02:25:13.071
COUNTING BOWLS HOME OWNERSHIP.

02:25:13.137 --> 02:25:16.574
IS NOT- COUNTED SO OUR PRIMARY

02:25:16.641 --> 02:25:21.045
RESIDENCE ISN'T COUNTED. IN OUR-

02:25:21.112 --> 02:25:22.713
YOU KNOW ASPECTS IT'S AN EXEMPT

02:25:22.780 --> 02:25:26.150
ASSET AND SO WHAT THAT MEANS IS

02:25:26.217 --> 02:25:28.219
AN OLDER ADULT. MORE LIKELY A

02:25:28.286 --> 02:25:30.221
WHITE OLDER ADULT COULD ONLY A

02:25:30.288 --> 02:25:33.658
MILLION DOLLAR HOME. WALL BLACK

02:25:33.724 --> 02:25:35.893
OLDER ADULT WHO'S LESS LIKELY

02:25:35.960 --> 02:25:37.361
TO OWN A HOME COULD HAVE A FEW

02:25:37.428 --> 02:25:38.596
THOUSAND DOLLARS IN ASSETS AND

02:25:38.663 --> 02:25:40.164
THAT WILL PUT THEM OVER THE

02:25:40.231 --> 02:25:42.200
ASSET LIMIT. AND TO QUANTIFY

02:25:42.266 --> 02:25:45.069
THIS SOMEWHAT IS- IN RECENT

02:25:45.136 --> 02:25:48.072
RESEARCH BASED ON SAN FRANCISCO

02:25:48.139 --> 02:25:50.007
61% OF WHITE RESIDENTS OWN

02:25:50.074 --> 02:25:52.276
THEIR OWN HOME WELL ONLY 33% OF

02:25:52.343 --> 02:25:54.912
BLACK RESIDENTS DO. IN AN LA IT

02:25:54.979 --> 02:25:56.514
WAS 50% OF WHITE RESIDENTS

02:25:56.581 --> 02:25:58.116
OWNING OUR OWN HOME. AND

02:25:58.182 --> 02:26:01.352
THEY'RE ONLY 33% OF BLACK

02:26:01.419 --> 02:26:01.953
RESIDENTS OWNING YOUR OWN HOME

02:26:02.019 --> 02:26:03.621
AS WELL. WE CAN REALLY SEE THAT

02:26:03.688 --> 02:26:05.490
STARK DIFFERENCE WHERE THE HOME

02:26:05.556 --> 02:26:07.592
OWNERSHIP- YOU KNOW YOU

02:26:07.658 --> 02:26:09.360
CERTAINLY COULD BE LOW INCOME

02:26:09.427 --> 02:26:11.562
AND OWN A HOME. AND GOT CREATES

02:26:11.629 --> 02:26:12.964
ITS OWN SET OF PROBLEMS BUT

02:26:13.030 --> 02:26:13.798
WHAT IT DOESN'T CREATE A

02:26:13.865 --> 02:26:15.600
PROBLEM IS FOR YOU TO ACTUALLY

02:26:15.666 --> 02:26:18.870
ACCESS META CAL. AND SO WE SEE

02:26:18.936 --> 02:26:19.904
THAT HOMEOWNERSHIP HAS BEEN

02:26:19.971 --> 02:26:21.405
RESTRICTED BECAUSE OF REDLINING

02:26:21.472 --> 02:26:23.107
AND PREDATORY LENDING AND

02:26:23.174 --> 02:26:23.808
DISCRIMINATION AND HOME

02:26:23.875 --> 02:26:26.310
OWNERSHIP- AND THEN WE CREATE

02:26:26.377 --> 02:26:28.312
EVEN. ADDITIONAL HURDLES NOW TO

02:26:28.379 --> 02:26:29.514
GET ON HEALTHCARE AND ON TO

02:26:29.580 --> 02:26:31.916
MEDIC HOW- BY CREATING A ROLE

02:26:31.983 --> 02:26:34.352
THAT. SUBSTANTIALLY LIMITS HOW

02:26:34.418 --> 02:26:35.853
MUCH THE AND ONE CAN HAVE IN A

02:26:35.920 --> 02:26:39.790
BANK ACCOUNT- AND STILL GET ON

02:26:39.857 --> 02:26:41.425
THE MEDICARE PROGRAM. I'M NEXT

02:26:41.492 --> 02:26:44.829
I REALLY THAT- HI. THE WAY THAT

02:26:44.896 --> 02:26:46.864
MEDIC HOW. YOU KNOW WE OFTEN

02:26:46.931 --> 02:26:47.999
TALK ABOUT IT OBVIOUSLY IT'S

02:26:48.065 --> 02:26:50.301
PRIMARY HEALTH. CARE PROGRAM

02:26:50.368 --> 02:26:51.802
WHICH IT IS BUT YOU KNOW

02:26:51.869 --> 02:26:53.204
RESEARCH HAS REALLY SHOWN THAT

02:26:53.271 --> 02:26:56.207
IT IS ALSO A HUGELY IMPACTFUL

02:26:56.274 --> 02:26:58.509
WAY TO REDUCE POVERTY. OLDER

02:26:58.576 --> 02:27:01.179
ADULTS- A BIG DRIVER OF POVERTY

02:27:01.245 --> 02:27:02.647
FOR OLDER ADULTS IS HEALTHCARE

02:27:02.713 --> 02:27:05.049
COSTS. IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS

02:27:05.116 --> 02:27:07.451
THAT- WE SEE EVEN WITH MEDICARE

02:27:07.518 --> 02:27:10.354
WHICH IS A GREAT PROGRAM IT'S

02:27:10.421 --> 02:27:11.622
NOT ENOUGH FOR LOW INCOME OLDER

02:27:11.689 --> 02:27:14.058
ADULTS TO SUCCESSFULLY- GET

02:27:14.125 --> 02:27:15.626
ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE IS

02:27:15.693 --> 02:27:19.030
AFFORDABLE. AND THAT'S WHY

02:27:19.096 --> 02:27:21.532
MEDICAL BECOME SO IMPORTANT. SO

02:27:21.599 --> 02:27:22.800
IF YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE MET A

02:27:22.867 --> 02:27:24.202
COW BEING AFFECTED AND HE

02:27:24.268 --> 02:27:26.037
POVERTY PROGRAM WE REALLY NEED

02:27:26.103 --> 02:27:28.272
TO TAKE AWAY THE ASSET TEST

02:27:28.339 --> 02:27:29.941
WERE SUBSTANTIALLY RAISING TO

02:27:30.007 --> 02:27:31.209
REALLY GET THAT EFFECT FOR

02:27:31.275 --> 02:27:32.343
OLDER ADULTS AND PEOPLE WITH

02:27:32.410 --> 02:27:33.711
DISABILITIES AND THIS IS

02:27:33.778 --> 02:27:35.012
PARTICULARLY TRUE IN THE

02:27:35.079 --> 02:27:36.480
PANDEMIC WHEN ACCESS TO

02:27:36.547 --> 02:27:37.815
HEALTHCARE INCLUDING HOLDING

02:27:37.882 --> 02:27:40.117
COMMUNITY SERVICES IS VITAL FOR

02:27:40.184 --> 02:27:41.819
BOTH PEOPLE'S HEALTH AND SAFETY

02:27:41.886 --> 02:27:43.721
I'M I WANT TO GIVE AN EXAMPLE

02:27:43.788 --> 02:27:46.123
ONE OF OUR- PARTNERS WHO WORKS

02:27:46.190 --> 02:27:48.092
IN A MEDICAL LEGAL PARTNERSHIP

02:27:48.159 --> 02:27:49.594
SHARED A STORY ABOUT A CLIENT

02:27:49.660 --> 02:27:51.829
SHE'S CURRENTLY HELPING US IN

02:27:51.896 --> 02:27:55.032
OUR SEVENTIES AND IS TRYING TO

02:27:55.099 --> 02:27:55.866
GET. ON TO MEDICARE. OF THE

02:27:55.933 --> 02:27:57.702
CLIENT SINGLE AND WORK FOR MANY

02:27:57.768 --> 02:27:59.403
YEARS THE PACKAGING DEPARTMENT

02:27:59.470 --> 02:28:01.939
OF A FACTORY. IN HER LIFETIME

02:28:02.006 --> 02:28:04.375
SHE WAS ABLE TO SAVE ABOUT

02:28:04.442 --> 02:28:06.310
ELEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS- SHE'S

02:28:06.377 --> 02:28:07.478
NOW BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH

02:28:07.545 --> 02:28:09.614
DEMENTIA AND SHE CANNOT LIVE

02:28:09.680 --> 02:28:12.216
ALONE ANYMORE- SHE'S MOVED IN

02:28:12.283 --> 02:28:13.050
WITH HER BROTHER AND HER

02:28:13.117 --> 02:28:19.223
BROTHER. AND OBVIOUSLY WITH

02:28:19.290 --> 02:28:20.391
ONLY ELEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS IN

02:28:20.458 --> 02:28:22.093
SAVINGS. AND ONLY SOCIAL

02:28:22.159 --> 02:28:23.828
SECURITY INCOME SHE CAN'T

02:28:23.894 --> 02:28:26.297
AFFORD TO PAY HIM. SO NOW

02:28:26.364 --> 02:28:28.566
THAT'S CREATING FINANCIAL

02:28:28.633 --> 02:28:29.367
INSTABILITY FOR THE ENTIRE

02:28:29.433 --> 02:28:32.703
FAMILY- SO NOW SHE'S REALLY

02:28:32.770 --> 02:28:35.640
FACED WITH THE CHOICE. OF SHE

02:28:35.706 --> 02:28:38.776
CAN SPEND DOWN BELOW TWO

02:28:38.843 --> 02:28:39.844
THOUSAND DOLLARS TO GET THE

02:28:39.910 --> 02:28:41.078
MEDICATION NEEDS UNLIKELY

02:28:41.145 --> 02:28:42.780
OBJECT MENTIONING I JUST AS SHE

02:28:42.847 --> 02:28:43.848
WOULD NEED SO THAT'S- GOING TO

02:28:43.914 --> 02:28:45.182
HAVE TO BE A HIGH PRIORITY FOR

02:28:45.249 --> 02:28:47.652
FAMILY. BUT ALSO IT'S REALLY

02:28:47.718 --> 02:28:49.687
PUTTING HER FAMILY'S. FINANCIAL

02:28:49.754 --> 02:28:51.455
STABILITY IN DISTRESS AS WELL

02:28:51.522 --> 02:28:55.660
BECAUSE IF SHE HAS ANY- NEEDS

02:28:55.726 --> 02:28:57.028
THAT ARE EXTRAORDINARY BEYONCE

02:28:57.094 --> 02:28:59.730
OR HER MONTHLY NEEDS SHE NOW

02:28:59.797 --> 02:29:00.498
DOESN'T REALLY HAVE A RAINY DAY

02:29:00.564 --> 02:29:03.434
FUND- AND SHE HAS TO BASICALLY

02:29:03.501 --> 02:29:05.336
DEPLETE HER ALREADY VERY MODEST

02:29:05.403 --> 02:29:08.339
SAVINGS. I JUST WANT TO SAY

02:29:08.406 --> 02:29:10.308
THAT THIS IS A VERY. IT'S SORT

02:29:10.374 --> 02:29:11.909
OF STARTLING BUT IT'S ALSO VERY

02:29:11.976 --> 02:29:13.644
TYPICAL YOU KNOW THIS IS WHAT

02:29:13.711 --> 02:29:14.578
YOU'RE GETTING AGAIN PEOPLE

02:29:14.645 --> 02:29:16.881
WITH. FIVE THOUSAND TEN

02:29:16.947 --> 02:29:17.715
THOUSAND OR FIFTEEN THOUSAND

02:29:17.782 --> 02:29:19.016
DOLLARS IT'S GENERALLY

02:29:19.083 --> 02:29:20.151
EXTREMELY MODEST AND THAT'S

02:29:20.217 --> 02:29:21.152
WHAT THE STATE OVER THEIR

02:29:21.218 --> 02:29:23.754
ENTIRE LIFETIME. AND NOW IT'S

02:29:23.821 --> 02:29:24.989
REALLY PREVENTING THEM FROM

02:29:25.056 --> 02:29:29.527
GETTING THE CARE THEY NEED- AND

02:29:29.593 --> 02:29:30.328
ONE THING I ALSO REALLY WANT TO

02:29:30.394 --> 02:29:32.029
HIGHLIGHT IS SO THAT'S YOU KNOW

02:29:32.096 --> 02:29:33.597
A THRESHOLD ISSUE OF GETTING ON

02:29:33.664 --> 02:29:35.299
TO THE MEDICARE PROGRAM BUT-

02:29:35.366 --> 02:29:37.068
YOU HAVE TO LIVE WITH. THOSE

02:29:37.134 --> 02:29:39.437
RESOURCE LIMITS THE ENTIRE TIME

02:29:39.503 --> 02:29:41.272
YOU'RE ON THE MEDICARE PROGRAM.

02:29:41.339 --> 02:29:43.040
SO THAT'S WHY IT ALSO NOT ONLY

02:29:43.107 --> 02:29:44.942
CREATES POVERTY BUT THAT IT CAN

02:29:45.009 --> 02:29:46.377
SUSTAIN IT BECAUSE YOU NEVER

02:29:46.444 --> 02:29:48.412
HAVE THE ABILITY TO CONTINUE

02:29:48.479 --> 02:29:50.147
SAVINGS. BUT TO CONTINUE

02:29:50.214 --> 02:29:54.852
SAVINGS SO- THE- BOB BAER YOUR

02:29:54.919 --> 02:29:57.188
FOR THAT IS IF YOU GO OVER THE

02:29:57.254 --> 02:29:58.456
LIMIT BY ONE DOLLAR YOU'RE

02:29:58.522 --> 02:29:59.890
ACTUALLY TERMINATED FROM THE

02:29:59.957 --> 02:30:00.958
PROGRAM AND THAT'S A BIG

02:30:01.025 --> 02:30:03.127
DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE INCOME

02:30:03.194 --> 02:30:04.528
LIMIT AND THE ASSET LIMITS TO

02:30:04.595 --> 02:30:06.564
WHAT WE WERE TALKING- FOR THE

02:30:06.630 --> 02:30:07.965
LAST COUPLE YEARS NOT RAISING

02:30:08.032 --> 02:30:10.201
THE INCOME LIMIT. YOU KNOW AT

02:30:10.267 --> 02:30:11.268
LEAST PEOPLE COULD STAY ON THE

02:30:11.335 --> 02:30:12.203
PROGRAM YOU WANT TO SHARE OF

02:30:12.269 --> 02:30:13.537
COSTS INSURANCE COSTS HAS ITS

02:30:13.604 --> 02:30:15.339
OWN PROBLEMS AND AFFORDABILITY

02:30:15.406 --> 02:30:17.775
ISSUES BUT ASSETS ACTUALLY

02:30:17.842 --> 02:30:19.076
TERMINATE YOU FROM THE PROGRAM

02:30:19.143 --> 02:30:20.478
SO IF YOU GO ONE DOLLAR OVER

02:30:20.544 --> 02:30:22.847
YOUR TERMINATE SO AGAIN GIVEN

02:30:22.913 --> 02:30:24.682
THE CHOICE PEOPLE CAN NEVER

02:30:24.749 --> 02:30:26.150
ACCRUE MEANINGFUL SAVINGS

02:30:26.217 --> 02:30:28.119
BECAUSE THEY'RE SO SCARED TO

02:30:28.185 --> 02:30:30.254
GET BUMPED OFF A BETTY CAL. AND

02:30:30.321 --> 02:30:31.722
IN MY EXPERIENCE AS A LEGAL AID

02:30:31.789 --> 02:30:33.891
ATTORNEY I DON'T KNOW THAT I'VE

02:30:33.958 --> 02:30:36.394
EVER HAD CLIENTS PAYING MORE

02:30:36.460 --> 02:30:37.928
THAN WHEN THEY ARE TERMINATED

02:30:37.995 --> 02:30:39.397
FROM MEDICAID EVEN LOSS OF

02:30:39.463 --> 02:30:40.731
INCOME LIKE IN TERMINATED FROM

02:30:40.798 --> 02:30:43.601
SSI OFTEN DIDN'T RANK AS

02:30:43.667 --> 02:30:44.802
FRIGHTENING TO PEOPLE BECAUSE

02:30:44.869 --> 02:30:46.370
THEY KNEW ONCE THEIR MEDICARE

02:30:46.437 --> 02:30:48.339
WAS CUT OFF THEIR ACCESS TO A

02:30:48.406 --> 02:30:50.541
HUGE. VARIETY OF PREVENTATIVE

02:30:50.608 --> 02:30:53.477
CARE CHRONIC CARE MANAGEMENT-

02:30:53.544 --> 02:30:55.546
DISEASE PREVENTION ONGOING

02:30:55.613 --> 02:30:57.381
TREATMENTS WAS GOING TO STOP SO

02:30:57.448 --> 02:30:58.916
YOU KNOW IT'S TRULY FRIGHTENING

02:30:58.983 --> 02:31:02.386
TO THEM TO FACE THAT- AND SO I

02:31:02.453 --> 02:31:03.921
WANT TO SHARE A STORY OF A

02:31:03.988 --> 02:31:05.756
WOMAN I ATUALLY WORKED WITH A

02:31:05.823 --> 02:31:07.958
FEW YEARS AGO- WAS REALLY

02:31:08.025 --> 02:31:08.926
FRIGHTENED AND FRANTIC WHEN SHE

02:31:08.993 --> 02:31:09.994
CAME IN BECAUSE SHE RECEIVED A

02:31:10.060 --> 02:31:11.662
TERMINATION NOTICE FROM MEDIC

02:31:11.729 --> 02:31:13.631
HELL BECAUSE SHE WAS OVER THE

02:31:13.697 --> 02:31:15.332
ASSET LIMIT. SO WE WERE TALKING

02:31:15.399 --> 02:31:17.735
SHE EXPLAINED THAT- SHE HAD

02:31:17.802 --> 02:31:20.337
BEEN SITTING BECAUSE SHE NEEDED

02:31:20.404 --> 02:31:21.539
TO HEARING AIDS AND BECAUSE

02:31:21.605 --> 02:31:23.307
THEY WERE SO EXPENSIVE SHE NEED

02:31:23.374 --> 02:31:24.141
TO DO THAT OVER TIME SHOULD

02:31:24.208 --> 02:31:26.177
SLOWLY BEEN SAVING AND FINALLY

02:31:26.243 --> 02:31:27.945
SAVED THE TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED

02:31:28.012 --> 02:31:29.847
DOLLARS SHE NEEDED- SO WHAT SHE

02:31:29.914 --> 02:31:31.015
DIDN'T REALIZE WHAT SHE WAS

02:31:31.081 --> 02:31:32.183
DOING THAT WASTHAT THAT

02:31:32.249 --> 02:31:33.717
SEATINGS WAS GOING TO PUSH HER

02:31:33.784 --> 02:31:35.286
OVER THE MEDIC CALUMET AND THAT

02:31:35.352 --> 02:31:36.587
WAS ACTUALLY GONNA LEAD TO HER

02:31:36.654 --> 02:31:41.792
TERMINATION. FROM THE PROGRAM.

02:31:41.859 --> 02:31:43.327
SO YOU KNOW SORT OF. IN HER

02:31:43.394 --> 02:31:45.663
CASE. SHE HAD WHERE WITH ALL TO

02:31:45.729 --> 02:31:46.897
SEE HELP KNEW THAT WE MEDICAID

02:31:46.964 --> 02:31:48.632
WOULD BE AS- PROBLEM FOR HER

02:31:48.699 --> 02:31:50.534
AND- WE WERE ABLE TO HELP HER

02:31:50.601 --> 02:31:52.102
GET BACK ON THE PROGRAM. BY

02:31:52.169 --> 02:31:53.737
SPENDING DOWN THE MONEY AND

02:31:53.804 --> 02:31:54.872
BUYING HEARING AIDS SHE NEEDED

02:31:54.939 --> 02:31:57.908
BUT- YOU KNOW IT. IS ALWAYS

02:31:57.975 --> 02:31:59.610
STUCK WITH FEEDBACK YOU KNOW

02:31:59.677 --> 02:32:00.744
SITTING THERE IN MY OFFICE

02:32:00.811 --> 02:32:02.513
TALKING THIS WOMAN EXPLAINING.

02:32:02.580 --> 02:32:05.616
JUST ABSOLUTELY PUNITIVE AND

02:32:05.683 --> 02:32:07.985
NONSENSICAL. GRAMMARLY TO HER

02:32:08.052 --> 02:32:11.155
WAS YOU KNOW SHE UNDERSTOOD IT.

02:32:11.222 --> 02:32:12.857
ON ONE LEVEL JITTERS ABOUT WAS

02:32:12.923 --> 02:32:15.092
THE RULES BUT SHE WAS REALLY

02:32:15.159 --> 02:32:16.894
STRUGGLING TO UNDERSTAND HOW IT

02:32:16.961 --> 02:32:18.896
MADE ANY SENSE AND I THINK

02:32:18.963 --> 02:32:19.396
THAT'S REALLY WHERE THE

02:32:19.463 --> 02:32:23.167
DISCONNECT IS- AND AS WE WERE

02:32:23.234 --> 02:32:24.435
TALKING AND EVERYONE ELSE WAS

02:32:24.502 --> 02:32:25.736
TESTIFYING YOU KNOW ONE OF

02:32:25.803 --> 02:32:27.571
THINGS THAT KEPT COMING UP AND-

02:32:27.638 --> 02:32:29.073
ORIGINAL. SPEECH BUT I JUST

02:32:29.139 --> 02:32:31.041
WANT TO HIGHLIGHT QUICKLY IS

02:32:31.108 --> 02:32:33.244
THE PREVENTATIVE CARE ASPECT OF

02:32:33.310 --> 02:32:35.779
THIS YOU KNOW WHAT PEOPLE THINK

02:32:35.846 --> 02:32:36.380
THEY'RE GOING TO BE CHARGED A

02:32:36.447 --> 02:32:37.982
LOT FOR HEALTH INSURANCE. THEY

02:32:38.048 --> 02:32:39.850
WAIT EVERY WEEK TO GET WHAT

02:32:39.917 --> 02:32:41.585
THEY NEED AND WE'RE NOW SEEING%

02:32:41.652 --> 02:32:43.254
BECAUSE THE AC HAS OPENED UP

02:32:43.320 --> 02:32:44.221
COVERAGE WITH SO MANY PEOPLE

02:32:44.288 --> 02:32:46.023
REALLY SEEM THOSE. REALLY

02:32:46.090 --> 02:32:47.658
ACADEMIC RIGOR STUDIES NOW THAT

02:32:47.725 --> 02:32:49.026
ARE ACTUALLY SHOWING THE WAYS

02:32:49.093 --> 02:32:50.394
IN WHICH PREVENTIVE CARE IS

02:32:50.461 --> 02:32:52.196
REALLY MAKING A HUGE DIFFERENCE

02:32:52.263 --> 02:32:54.064
IN PEOPLE'S LIVES. AND SO I

02:32:54.131 --> 02:32:54.965
JUST WANT TO POINT OUT

02:32:55.032 --> 02:32:56.200
YESTERDAY ON HEALTHCARE IS

02:32:56.267 --> 02:32:57.968
PUBLISHED A STUDY FROM UCLA

02:32:58.035 --> 02:33:02.039
CENTER FOR POLICY HELP IF YOU

02:33:02.106 --> 02:33:02.740
NEED FOR HEALTH POLICY AND- IN

02:33:02.806 --> 02:33:03.274
CONJUNCTION WITH UNITS. OF

02:33:03.340 --> 02:33:05.309
CHILE WHERE WE- FOUND. THAT THE

02:33:05.376 --> 02:33:07.978
ACA REDUCE CANCER THE CANCER

02:33:08.045 --> 02:33:09.613
DETECTION SPIKE THAT USED TO

02:33:09.680 --> 02:33:12.116
OCCUR AT AGE SIXTY FIVE BY 45%

02:33:12.182 --> 02:33:14.184
SO WHAT THAT MEANS IS. BECAUSE

02:33:14.251 --> 02:33:16.153
PEOPLE OFTEN UNINSURED UNTIL

02:33:16.220 --> 02:33:17.721
SIXTY FIVE. A WHEN THEY SHOWED

02:33:17.788 --> 02:33:19.089
UP AT THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE BASED

02:33:19.156 --> 02:33:22.760
ON THIS HUGE SPIKE IN CANCER-

02:33:22.826 --> 02:33:24.328
DETECTION BECAUSE PEOPLE HAVE

02:33:24.395 --> 02:33:25.195
BASICALLY BEEN IGNORING

02:33:25.262 --> 02:33:26.897
SYMPTOMS. UNABLE TO GET

02:33:26.964 --> 02:33:28.899
PREVENTIVE CARE AND THEN WHEN

02:33:28.966 --> 02:33:30.167
PEOPLE DID GET THEIR CANCERS

02:33:30.234 --> 02:33:31.936
DETECTED THEY WERE MUCH MORE

02:33:32.002 --> 02:33:33.470
SIGNIFICANTLY FAR ALONG IN

02:33:33.537 --> 02:33:35.573
TERMS OF SEVERITY. SO THE OTHER

02:33:35.639 --> 02:33:37.975
THING THAT'S HELPED REDUCE WAS-

02:33:38.042 --> 02:33:39.376
THAT TWO THIRDS OF THE CANCERS

02:33:39.443 --> 02:33:41.679
DETECTED. EARLIER MAJOR MIDDLE

02:33:41.745 --> 02:33:43.347
STAGES AND WERE MORE HIGHLY

02:33:43.414 --> 02:33:45.349
TREATABLE. SO I JUST WANT TO

02:33:45.416 --> 02:33:46.684
REALLY SHOW HOW EFFECTIVE

02:33:46.750 --> 02:33:48.152
COVERAGE ISN'T KEEPING PEOPLE

02:33:48.218 --> 02:33:49.420
HEALTHY AND I KNOW WE STAND ALL

02:33:49.486 --> 02:33:50.521
THE TIME BUT THAT TO ME JUST

02:33:50.588 --> 02:33:51.956
FELT LIKE. SUCH A STARK

02:33:52.022 --> 02:33:53.991
REMINDER OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING

02:33:54.058 --> 02:33:54.592
ABOUT WHEN PEOPLE CAN GET THE

02:33:54.658 --> 02:33:57.194
CARE THEY NEED. THEY CAN STAY

02:33:57.261 --> 02:33:58.295
HEALTHIER AND GET THE TREATMENT

02:33:58.362 --> 02:34:01.599
THEY NEED- AND LASTLY BEFORE

02:34:01.665 --> 02:34:02.866
BECAUSE I JUST REALLY WANT TO

02:34:02.933 --> 02:34:04.335
HIGHLIGHT HOW THIS ALL REALLY

02:34:04.401 --> 02:34:05.803
ALSO FITS IN WITH OUR STATE

02:34:05.869 --> 02:34:07.304
GOALS AROUND THE MASTER PLAN

02:34:07.371 --> 02:34:09.473
FOR AGING. BUT I WAS ON THE

02:34:09.540 --> 02:34:11.408
LTSS SUBCOMMITTEE AND JUSTICE

02:34:11.475 --> 02:34:13.544
IN AGING WAS ALSO- MY-

02:34:13.611 --> 02:34:15.613
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR WAS ALSO ON

02:34:15.679 --> 02:34:18.816
THE STAKEHOLDER ADVISORY.

02:34:18.882 --> 02:34:20.184
COMMITTEE- YOU KNOW THE MASTER

02:34:20.250 --> 02:34:20.684
PLAN JUST CAME OUT FROM

02:34:20.751 --> 02:34:24.588
GOVERNOR'S. IN JANUARY AND I

02:34:24.655 --> 02:34:25.389
JUST REALLY WANT TO POINT OUT

02:34:25.456 --> 02:34:27.558
THAT CHANGING THIS POLICY. IS

02:34:27.625 --> 02:34:30.394
IN LINE WITH THREE OUT OF THE

02:34:30.461 --> 02:34:32.863
FIVE GOALS. A BROAD GOALS FOR

02:34:32.930 --> 02:34:35.332
THE MASTER PLAN AND THAT'S TO

02:34:35.399 --> 02:34:36.967
BASICALLY ENSURE ACCESS TO

02:34:37.034 --> 02:34:38.535
AFFORDABLE HEALTHCARE TO

02:34:38.602 --> 02:34:40.671
INCREASE EQUITY IN CALIFORNIA

02:34:40.738 --> 02:34:42.573
AND TO REDUCE POVERTY AMONG.

02:34:42.640 --> 02:34:43.574
PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND

02:34:43.641 --> 02:34:45.476
OLDER CALIFORNIANS AND SO I

02:34:45.542 --> 02:34:46.877
JUST REALLY THINK IT'S

02:34:46.944 --> 02:34:47.778
IMPORTANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT

02:34:47.845 --> 02:34:48.912
COULD REALLY SHOWS WHAT A

02:34:48.979 --> 02:34:50.347
POWERFUL BACK ADDRESSING THIS

02:34:50.414 --> 02:34:53.350
OUTDATED CAN HOW- JUST ONE RULE

02:34:53.417 --> 02:34:54.718
CHANGE CAN CAUSE HUGE

02:34:54.785 --> 02:34:56.353
DIFFERENCE. UP AND REALLY

02:34:56.420 --> 02:34:57.988
ADVANCE IS THREE REALLY

02:34:58.055 --> 02:34:59.223
MEANINGFUL POLICY GOALS AND

02:34:59.289 --> 02:35:01.291
CREATE A CALIFORNIA FOR ALL SO

02:35:01.358 --> 02:35:02.326
WITH THAT I'LL STOP AND THANK

02:35:02.393 --> 02:35:05.295
YOU AGAIN FOR ALLOWING ME TO

02:35:05.362 --> 02:35:05.929
TESTIFY TODAY. THANK YOU VERY

02:35:05.996 --> 02:35:07.931
MUCH I AM COMING BACK TO THE

02:35:07.998 --> 02:35:12.302
COMMITTEE QUESTIONS DR ABDUL-

02:35:12.369 --> 02:35:13.804
FIRST I ALWAYS LOVE TALKING

02:35:13.871 --> 02:35:15.673
WITH LEGAL AID LAWYERS LIKE I

02:35:15.739 --> 02:35:17.541
THINK IT'S IN PART BECAUSE MY

02:35:17.608 --> 02:35:19.977
MOM HAS ONE AND- SE FIGHTS TO

02:35:20.044 --> 02:35:22.479
HELP TO KEEP PEOPLE- TO GET

02:35:22.546 --> 02:35:23.347
THEM THE COVERAGE THEY HAVE

02:35:23.414 --> 02:35:25.049
WHEN THEY HAVE INTERESTS. I

02:35:25.115 --> 02:35:26.250
WANT TO HIGHLIGHT A FEW OF THE

02:35:26.316 --> 02:35:28.085
COMMENTS THAT YOU MADE- I DON'T

02:35:28.152 --> 02:35:29.787
INHERENTLY HAVE A QUESTION BUT

02:35:29.853 --> 02:35:32.322
I FOUND YOUR- TESTIMONY QUITE

02:35:32.389 --> 02:35:34.291
POWERFUL. YOUR LAST WORDS WERE

02:35:34.358 --> 02:35:36.126
IT'S A STARK REMINDER BUT WE

02:35:36.193 --> 02:35:38.295
NEED TO REMEMBER THE PEOPLE WHO

02:35:38.362 --> 02:35:40.164
ARE IMPACTED BY THE POLICIES

02:35:40.230 --> 02:35:41.331
AND PROGRAMS THAT WE PUT IN

02:35:41.398 --> 02:35:44.068
PLACE. I WAS PARTICULARLY MOVED

02:35:44.134 --> 02:35:44.802
BY YOUR COMMENTS ABOUT

02:35:44.868 --> 02:35:46.336
STRUCTURAL RACISM AND HOW THIS

02:35:46.403 --> 02:35:48.806
CONTINUES TO PERPETUATE THOSE.

02:35:48.872 --> 02:35:50.274
INCOME INEQUALITIES FOR OUR

02:35:50.340 --> 02:35:52.242
COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. BUT

02:35:52.309 --> 02:35:53.677
REALLY WANT TO FOCUS IN IF I

02:35:53.744 --> 02:35:54.978
COULD ON TO ONE OF CHEN

02:35:55.045 --> 02:35:56.947
FLURRIES COMMENTS. WHERE SHE-

02:35:57.014 --> 02:35:59.249
HAD ASKED THE PERSON O YOU

02:35:59.316 --> 02:36:02.019
KNOW WHAT THE TERM INDENTURED.

02:36:02.086 --> 02:36:04.021
BECAUSE EARLIER WE HEARD THAT

02:36:04.088 --> 02:36:06.156
THE ACID TEST WAS A GATE KEEPER

02:36:06.223 --> 02:36:08.125
IF YOU WILL. BUT NOW THAT IMAGE

02:36:08.192 --> 02:36:09.827
IS DIFFERENT IF WE'RE ACTUALLY

02:36:09.893 --> 02:36:12.129
LOOKING AT- THE FACT THAT YOU

02:36:12.196 --> 02:36:13.230
HAVE TO LIVE YOUR LIFE

02:36:13.297 --> 02:36:15.132
DIFFERENTLY AFTER YOU GET

02:36:15.199 --> 02:36:16.767
THROUGH THAT. AND SO RATHER

02:36:16.834 --> 02:36:19.269
THAN MAKING A METAPHOR THAT.

02:36:19.336 --> 02:36:21.872
MIGHT PUSH IT TOO FAR I SIMPLY.

02:36:21.939 --> 02:36:23.507
BELIEVE THAT HIS STATEMENT IS

02:36:23.574 --> 02:36:25.609
POWERFUL AND THAT WE NEED TO

02:36:25.676 --> 02:36:26.710
REMEMBER THAT IF PEOPLE ARE

02:36:26.777 --> 02:36:28.345
MAKING DECISIONS BASED OFF OF

02:36:28.412 --> 02:36:30.481
THE POLICIES WE HAVE WE HAVE A

02:36:30.547 --> 02:36:33.550
RESPONSIBILITY TO HELP MAKE AND

02:36:33.617 --> 02:36:35.953
IMPROVE UPON THOSE. WITH THAT I

02:36:36.019 --> 02:36:37.654
WILL END BECAUSE I DON'T THINK

02:36:37.721 --> 02:36:38.989
I COULD HAVE SAID IT MUCH

02:36:39.056 --> 02:36:40.324
BETTER THAN CLEAR RAMSEY OCEAN

02:36:40.390 --> 02:36:42.226
