00:27:45.497 --> 00:27:46.564
BE APPLIED TO CRITICAL

00:27:46.631 --> 00:27:48.366
INFRASTRUCTURE TODAY. AND WE

00:27:48.433 --> 00:27:49.968
ALSO RUN TO ICE AXE THE MULTI

INFRASTRUCTURE I SAT. ABOUT THE

00:27:54.739 --> 00:27:56.307
STATE ISAC IS ACTUALLY THE

00:27:56.374 --> 00:27:57.642
LARGEST ICE PACK IN THE WORLD

RUN IN PUBLIC ON UTILITIES. WE

00:28:14.592 --> 00:28:15.326
RUN A TWENTY FOUR BY SEVEN TWO

AND THEN SINCE TWO THOUSAND

00:28:27.806 --> 00:28:28.673
EIGHTEEN WE HAVE ALSO DONE THE

CYBER THREATS YOU HAVE TAX ON

00:28:41.519 --> 00:28:43.321
ON CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE HAD

00:28:43.388 --> 00:28:44.055
BEEN MUCH LESS COMMON

00:28:44.122 --> 00:28:45.757
HISTORICALLY. BEEN ATTACKS ON

00:28:45.824 --> 00:28:47.725
STANDARD BUSINESS NETWORKS IS

00:28:47.792 --> 00:28:48.993
DIFFICULT WITH THE DATA THAT WE

00:28:49.060 --> 00:28:50.328
HAVE AT THE END OF SIZE ACTED

00:28:50.395 --> 00:28:52.063
CONFIDENTLY STATE. THAT THERE

00:28:52.130 --> 00:28:53.665
IS AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF

00:28:53.731 --> 00:28:55.733
TARGETED ATTACKS. BUT

00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:57.235
NONETHELESS A RECENT EXAMPLES

00:28:57.302 --> 00:28:58.670
HAVE BECOME MAJOR NEWS STORIES

00:28:58.736 --> 00:28:59.971
TO THEIR WIDESPREAD IMPACT.

00:29:00.038 --> 00:29:02.474
INTO MOST OBVIOUS EXAMPLES ARE

00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:03.808
THE COLONIAL PIPELINE IN JBS

00:29:03.875 --> 00:29:05.543
FOODS NEITHER OF WHICH ARE

00:29:05.610 --> 00:29:07.579
THOUGHT HE T. RUN BUT THE THIRD

00:29:07.645 --> 00:29:09.013
SECOND THIRD ORDER EFFECTS OF

00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:15.987
THOSE. I DID IMPACTOF. STATE

00:29:16.054 --> 00:29:16.488
LOCAL TRIBAL TERRITORIAL

00:29:16.554 --> 00:29:17.122
GOVERNMENTS. GOOD NEWS IS THAT

00:29:17.188 --> 00:29:18.890
YOU. FOR TO OR SOME. ENOUGH TO

00:29:18.957 --> 00:29:20.091
ADD. IMPACT THE OPERATE TECH

00:29:20.158 --> 00:29:21.793
ITSELF. THE BAD NEWS IS THAT

00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:22.827
THEY DON'T HAVE TO TARGET THAT

00:29:22.894 --> 00:29:24.929
TECHNOLOGY ITSELF- TO HAVE A

00:29:24.996 --> 00:29:26.164
SIGNIFICANT IMPACT CAN

00:29:26.231 --> 00:29:27.332
POTENTIALLY COMPROMISE THE

00:29:27.398 --> 00:29:28.366
INTEGRITY OF THE INDUSTRIAL

00:29:28.433 --> 00:29:29.701
ENVIRONMENT. AND THERE ARE

00:29:29.767 --> 00:29:31.302
CERTAINLY CASES WHERE THE

00:29:31.369 --> 00:29:32.704
OPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY IS THE

00:29:32.770 --> 00:29:34.105
TARGET OF AN ATTACK SUCH AS

00:29:34.172 --> 00:29:35.507
WHAT HAPPENED IN OLD BALTIMORE

00:29:35.573 --> 00:29:37.575
FLORIDA. IN FEBRUARY THIS YEAR

00:29:37.642 --> 00:29:39.077
WHEN THE PACKER TEMPTED TO

00:29:39.144 --> 00:29:40.678
POISON THE WATER SUPPLY. AND

00:29:40.745 --> 00:29:41.613
WHILE IT'S CERTAINLY

00:29:41.679 --> 00:29:43.414
FRIGHTENING AND THEN WE SHOULD

00:29:43.481 --> 00:29:45.216
BE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT. MOST

00:29:45.283 --> 00:29:46.985
OF THE INSTANCES OF ATTACKS ON

00:29:47.051 --> 00:29:49.554
CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE NOT

00:29:49.621 --> 00:29:50.288
THIS WAY FOR. IN BOTH THE

00:29:50.355 --> 00:29:52.323
COLONIAL PIPELINE IN JBS FOODS

00:29:52.390 --> 00:29:54.392
ATTACKS. AS WELL AS A TACK ON

00:29:54.459 --> 00:29:56.461
HONDA IN TWENTY TWENTY. NORSK

00:29:56.528 --> 00:29:58.263
HYDRO TWENTY NINETEEN THE

00:29:58.329 --> 00:29:58.963
SYSTEMS AFFECTED WERE NOT

00:29:59.030 --> 00:30:00.498
CONTROL SYSTEMS BUT STANDARD

00:30:00.565 --> 00:30:02.867
BUSINESS SYSTEMS ARE SYSTEMS

00:30:02.934 --> 00:30:04.469
USUALLY BUSINESS OPERATIONS.

00:30:04.536 --> 00:30:06.137
LIKEWISE ALL THESE ATTACKS WERE

00:30:06.204 --> 00:30:08.840
CONDUCTED BY CRIMINAL ACTORS.

00:30:08.907 --> 00:30:10.575
LOOKING FOR A BIG PAYDAY. ALL

00:30:10.642 --> 00:30:11.543
FOUR OF THOSE ATTACKS INVOLVED

00:30:11.609 --> 00:30:13.211
RANSOMWARE WHICH IS ARGUABLY

00:30:13.278 --> 00:30:14.145
THE FASTEST GROWING TRUCK

00:30:14.212 --> 00:30:15.747
ACROSS ALL SECTORS TODAY AND

00:30:15.813 --> 00:30:17.248
CERTAINLY WHAT WE SEE THE MOST

00:30:17.315 --> 00:30:19.350
OF AT THE NSIC. MY CURRENT SELF

00:30:19.417 --> 00:30:20.785
ESTEEM ALONG WITH DHS'S

00:30:20.852 --> 00:30:22.353
INTELLIGENCE ANALYSIS RECENTLY

00:30:22.420 --> 00:30:23.621
COMPLETED A JOINT ASSESSMENT

00:30:23.688 --> 00:30:25.490
IRAN'S MORE TRENDS. BASED ON

00:30:25.557 --> 00:30:27.058
GLOBAL CONDITIONS AND WHAT WERE

00:30:27.125 --> 00:30:28.393
THE DATA THAT WE'RE COLLECTING.

00:30:28.459 --> 00:30:29.561
FOR THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT WE

00:30:29.627 --> 00:30:31.396
ASSESS THAT RANSOMWARE ATTACKS

00:30:31.462 --> 00:30:33.164
TARGETING US NETWORKS. ARE

00:30:33.231 --> 00:30:34.799
LIKELY TO INCREASE IN THE NEAR

00:30:34.866 --> 00:30:37.068
AND LONG TERM. BECAUSE CYBER

00:30:37.135 --> 00:30:38.069
CRIMINALS HAVE DEVELOPED

00:30:38.136 --> 00:30:39.737
EFFECTIVE BUSINESS MODELS.

00:30:39.804 --> 00:30:41.906
INCREASE THEIR FINANCIAL GAIN.

00:30:41.973 --> 00:30:42.807
LIKELY HAD PROPER RACIAL

00:30:42.874 --> 00:30:46.511
SUCCESS. AND ANONYMITY. ANOTHER

00:30:46.578 --> 00:30:47.612
NUMBER OF FACTORS AT PLAY IN

00:30:47.679 --> 00:30:49.380
HERE. ACCORDING LARGELY

00:30:49.447 --> 00:30:50.315
UNREGULATED CRYPTOCURRENCY

00:30:50.381 --> 00:30:52.550
MARKET AND ESPECIALLY THE

00:30:52.617 --> 00:30:53.151
WILLINGNESS OF VICTIMS TO PAY

00:30:53.218 --> 00:30:55.386
RANSOMS. DESPITE SOME GROUPS

00:30:55.453 --> 00:30:56.955
CLAIMING THEY WILL NOT TARGET

00:30:57.021 --> 00:30:58.656
CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE

00:30:58.723 --> 00:30:59.824
NETWORKS CONTINUE TO BE

00:30:59.891 --> 00:31:01.759
ATTRACTIVE TARGETS WE SHOULD BE

00:31:01.826 --> 00:31:02.860
OF GREAT CONCERN TO THOSE

00:31:02.927 --> 00:31:04.529
DEFENDING SLT P. OWNED AND

00:31:04.596 --> 00:31:05.063
OPERATED CRITICAL

00:31:05.129 --> 00:31:06.664
INFRASTRUCTURE. FOR A FEW

00:31:06.731 --> 00:31:09.000
REASONS THE FIRST. IS THAT YOUR

00:31:09.067 --> 00:31:11.302
AIR GAPPING A CRITICAL

00:31:11.369 --> 00:31:11.869
INFRASTRUCTURE IS NO LONGER

00:31:11.936 --> 00:31:13.805
PRACTICAL. FOR A SECOND THAT

00:31:13.871 --> 00:31:14.939
RANSOMWARE ON THESE NETWORKS

00:31:15.006 --> 00:31:17.075
WILL DENY ACCESS TO SYSTEMS

00:31:17.141 --> 00:31:18.243
THAT COULD BE ESSENTIAL AND

00:31:18.309 --> 00:31:19.811
MONITORING ADMINISTERING AND

00:31:19.877 --> 00:31:21.746
CONTROLLING. OR AT LEAST

00:31:21.813 --> 00:31:23.281
TRANSLATING BETWEEN STANDARD

00:31:23.348 --> 00:31:24.882
TECHNOLOGY AND OPERATIONAL

00:31:24.949 --> 00:31:27.352
TECHNOLOGY. CRITICALITY THE

00:31:27.418 --> 00:31:28.920
SYSTEM'S PUTS PRESSURE ON CHECK

00:31:28.987 --> 00:31:31.089
DOWNS TO PAY THE RANSOM GENDER

00:31:31.155 --> 00:31:33.024
PAY THEM QUICKLY AND DUE TO THE

00:31:33.091 --> 00:31:34.325
EVOLUTION OF THE RANSOMWARE

00:31:34.392 --> 00:31:36.527
BUSINESS MODEL. HANG AROUND

00:31:36.594 --> 00:31:37.495
SOME DOES NOT NECESSARILY

00:31:37.562 --> 00:31:39.831
CONSTITUTE APRIL DEPARTURE OF

00:31:39.897 --> 00:31:40.598
CRIMINAL ACTORS FROM THE VICTIM

00:31:40.665 --> 00:31:42.166
ENVIRONMENT WITH REGARD TO

00:31:42.233 --> 00:31:43.101
CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURES

00:31:43.167 --> 00:31:44.569
SPECIFICALLY IN RANSOMWARE WE

00:31:44.636 --> 00:31:47.071
EXPECT TO SEE MORE TARGETING OF

00:31:47.138 --> 00:31:48.973
THE TOP CRITICAL NETWORKS AND

00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:50.575
OPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY AS A

00:31:50.642 --> 00:31:52.543
GOAL BECAUSE THE GOAL OF THESE

00:31:52.610 --> 00:31:54.646
ACTORS IS A QUICK PAYDAY. IF

00:31:54.712 --> 00:31:55.813
YOU ORGANIZATIONS HAVE THE

00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:59.317
UPTIME REQUIREMENTS. FOR THOSE

00:31:59.384 --> 00:31:59.751
WHO OPERATE CRITICAL

00:31:59.817 --> 00:32:00.351
INFRASTRUCTURE. WE'RE THINKING

00:32:00.418 --> 00:32:02.086
BEYOND RANSOMWARE THERE ARE

00:32:02.153 --> 00:32:03.488
NATION STATE ACTORS AND OTHER

00:32:03.554 --> 00:32:04.522
CRIMINAL ACTORS WHO HAVE

00:32:04.589 --> 00:32:05.823
SPECIFIC INTERESTING CRITICAL

00:32:05.890 --> 00:32:07.925
INFRASTRUCTURE. IN OPERATIONAL

00:32:07.992 --> 00:32:09.260
TECHNOLOGY FOR A VARIETY OF

00:32:09.327 --> 00:32:10.795
REASONS THAT CAN INCLUDE

00:32:10.862 --> 00:32:13.665
ESPIONAGE DESTRUCTION. AWAY AND

00:32:13.731 --> 00:32:15.400
EVEN INFLUENCE OPERATIONS. BUT

00:32:15.466 --> 00:32:16.367
NO MATTER THE REASON IT'S

00:32:16.434 --> 00:32:17.535
IMPORTANT FOR US TO RECOGNIZE

00:32:17.602 --> 00:32:18.803
THAT MALICIOUS CYBER ACTORS

00:32:18.870 --> 00:32:20.038
WILL INCREASINGLY TARGET

00:32:20.104 --> 00:32:22.173
NETWORKS THAT. ARE SPECIFIC

00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:23.808
INTEREST TO US GOVERNMENT

00:32:23.875 --> 00:32:26.010
ENTITIES AT THE FEDERAL STATE

00:32:26.077 --> 00:32:27.612
AND LOCAL LEVEL ESPECIALLY

00:32:27.679 --> 00:32:29.414
THOSE NETWORKS DEEMED AS

00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:31.015
CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE. THAT

00:32:31.082 --> 00:32:32.383
ALLOWS ME TO GAIN AN ECONOMIC

00:32:32.450 --> 00:32:34.919
OR FINANCIAL POLITICAL SOCIAL

00:32:34.986 --> 00:32:36.821
OR EVEN MILITARY ADVANTAGE.

00:32:36.888 --> 00:32:37.889
BECAUSE CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE

00:32:37.955 --> 00:32:39.057
IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY

00:32:39.123 --> 00:32:41.259
CONNECTED TO THE INTERNET OR

00:32:41.326 --> 00:32:41.893
RELIANT UPON INTERNET CONNECTED

00:32:41.959 --> 00:32:43.995
DEVICES- WE SHOULD EXPECT TO

00:32:44.062 --> 00:32:45.063
SEE AN INCREASE IN SUCCESSFUL

00:32:45.129 --> 00:32:49.500
TAX AND WITH THAT. I WOULD LIKE

00:32:49.567 --> 00:32:50.868
TO RECOMMEND FOR- GET RIGHT FOR

00:32:50.935 --> 00:32:53.771

00:32:53.838 --> 00:32:54.372
AND I SUBSTATIONS

00:32:54.439 --> 00:32:55.673
RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE STATE

00:32:55.740 --> 00:32:57.208
THAT NEARLY A QUARTER OF ALL

00:32:57.275 --> 00:32:57.675
NON DEFENSE CRITICAL

00:32:57.742 --> 00:33:00.978
INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE U. S. IS

00:33:01.045 --> 00:33:02.113
OWNED AND OPERATED BY SLT PIECE.

00:33:02.180 --> 00:33:03.514
SO THERE'S WORK THAT NEEDS TO

00:33:03.581 --> 00:33:04.382
BE DONE HERE AND THE FOLLOWING

00:33:04.449 --> 00:33:05.583
RECOMMENDATIONS ARE DESIGNED TO

00:33:05.650 --> 00:33:07.051
BE IMPLEMENTED. WITH NO

MISTER ROSE POINTED OUT- THIS

00:37:13.464 --> 00:37:15.132
IS CLEARLY AN UNPRECEDENTED

00:37:15.199 --> 00:37:17.635
PERIOD YOU KNOW THE VOLUME

00:37:17.702 --> 00:37:19.971
VELOCITY AND COMPLEXITY. OF THE

00:37:20.037 --> 00:37:21.505
THREAT THAT WE'RE SEEING ARE

00:37:21.572 --> 00:37:24.008
UNPRECEDENTED- AND IF YOU YOU

00:37:24.075 --> 00:37:26.177
KNOW GO BACK TO SOME SOURCES SO

00:37:26.243 --> 00:37:28.546
THE- THE DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL

00:37:28.613 --> 00:37:31.148
INTELLIGENCE- WORLDWIDE THREAT

00:37:31.215 --> 00:37:33.117
ASSESSMENT. AGAIN HAS

00:37:33.184 --> 00:37:36.220
CONFIRMED. AND STATED THAT OUR

00:37:36.287 --> 00:37:37.722
SOPHISTICATED NATION STATE

00:37:37.788 --> 00:37:39.423
ADVERSARIES ABSOLUTELY HAVE THE

00:37:39.490 --> 00:37:41.492
CAPABILITY TO DISRUPT CRITICAL

00:37:41.559 --> 00:37:43.027
INFRASTRUCTURE. ALSO THAT'S

00:37:43.094 --> 00:37:44.095
SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO

00:37:44.161 --> 00:37:45.830
MONITOR FOR AND ALSO THAT

00:37:45.896 --> 00:37:47.431
ORGANIZED CRIME WILL CONTINUE

00:37:47.498 --> 00:37:49.834
TO TRY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF US

00:37:49.900 --> 00:37:51.869
RIGHT AND DISRUPT. BOB PUT

00:37:51.936 --> 00:37:55.072
THEIR OWN MONETARY GAINS- AND-

00:37:55.139 --> 00:37:57.642
ACTUALLY THESE TAXES WHILE- AND

00:37:57.708 --> 00:38:00.444
TO THE POINT OF- VELOCITY AND

00:38:00.511 --> 00:38:02.847
VOLUME. YOU KNOW MICROSOFT IN

00:38:02.913 --> 00:38:05.583
THEIR ANNUAL- THREAT- BOULDER

00:38:05.650 --> 00:38:09.253
ABILITY REPORT. CITED A 48%

00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:11.188
INCREASE IN VULNERABILITIES

00:38:11.255 --> 00:38:13.624
FROM TWENTY NINETEEN. TO TWENTY

00:38:13.691 --> 00:38:15.826
TWENTY- SO THAT IS A STEP

00:38:15.893 --> 00:38:17.461
CHANGE IN TERMS OF THE AMOUNT

00:38:17.528 --> 00:38:19.630
OF- BALL THE BILL THESE THAT

00:38:19.697 --> 00:38:21.666
COMPANIES NEED TO DEAL WITH-

00:38:21.732 --> 00:38:23.701
AND WHETHER IT'S UTILITY OR ANY

00:38:23.768 --> 00:38:24.402
OTHER CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE

00:38:24.468 --> 00:38:26.904
SECTOR- BUT IT'S- YOU KNOW.

00:38:26.971 --> 00:38:28.639
THAT ALSO GET SAMPLE FIVE WHEN

00:38:28.706 --> 00:38:30.107
YOU THINK ABOUT OTHER SOFTWARE

00:38:30.174 --> 00:38:32.510
PROVIDERS AND OTHER- QUICKENING

00:38:32.576 --> 00:38:34.745
PROVIDERS RIGHT AND SO CLEARLY

00:38:34.812 --> 00:38:36.847
THE NUMBER AND THE PACEOF THE

00:38:36.914 --> 00:38:40.084
VULNERABILITIES- REALLY IS WE

00:38:40.151 --> 00:38:41.485
ARE CONTINUING TO THE CLIPS YOU

00:38:41.552 --> 00:38:48.793
KNOW ANY PRIOR- PATTERNS THAT

00:38:48.859 --> 00:38:50.795
WE'VE HAD BEFORE- CERTAINLY WE

00:38:50.861 --> 00:38:52.129
SEEN ENOUGH. INCREASE IN RATES.

00:38:52.196 --> 00:38:54.965
AND SORTS USE THIS IN THE TO-

00:38:55.032 --> 00:38:57.301
SO THE ATTACK ON CALL- AS WE AS

00:38:57.368 --> 00:38:59.370
J. ASPECT THERE ARE BEEN RAN.

00:38:59.437 --> 00:39:02.506
ATTACKS IN THE SECTOR IS- AGAIN

00:39:02.573 --> 00:39:04.241
SO WITH END WE ARE ABSOLUTE

00:39:04.308 --> 00:39:06.544
SENIOR INCREASE- IN IN THAT

00:39:06.610 --> 00:39:09.313
ACTIVITY. I'M GOING FORWARD THE

COMPROMISE IN DECEMBER- AND

00:39:15.586 --> 00:39:17.655
THEN CONTINUING TO OTHER YOU

00:39:17.722 --> 00:39:19.156

AND LEARN WHAT THEY CAN LEARN

00:39:47.351 --> 00:39:48.886
AND YOU KNOW TRAVERSE LATERALLY

00:39:48.953 --> 00:39:51.188
ACROSS NETWORKS. FOR THEIR GAIN

00:39:51.255 --> 00:39:53.224
AND WHETHER IT'S FOR-

STRETCHES WE GO FORWARD. DONALD

00:40:23.187 --> 00:40:26.624
GUARDING- THE- THE QUESTION OF

00:40:26.690 --> 00:40:28.793
SEGMENTATION WHICH IS YOU KNOW

00:40:28.859 --> 00:40:29.927
HOW DO YOU PROTECT THESE

00:40:29.994 --> 00:40:30.661
ENVIRONMENTS PARTICULARLY

00:40:30.728 --> 00:40:32.863
OPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY

00:40:32.930 --> 00:40:35.833
ENVIRONMENTS- YOU KNOW WE STILL

00:40:35.900 --> 00:40:37.301
BELIEVE THAT NETWORKS SHOULD BE

00:40:37.368 --> 00:40:39.136
SEGMENTED STILL OPERATIONAL

00:40:39.203 --> 00:40:41.071
TECHNOLOGY NETWORKS SHOULD BE

00:40:41.138 --> 00:40:41.572
SEGMENTED FROM CORPORATE

00:40:41.639 --> 00:40:43.607
NETWORKS. BUT MR ROSE POINTED

00:40:43.674 --> 00:40:44.708
OUT THAT IS NOT THE ONLY

THAT WE TRY TO REINFORCE IS

00:41:25.249 --> 00:41:26.584
WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT ATTACHED

00:41:26.650 --> 00:41:27.618
LIKE SO WHEN AND ALSO THE

00:41:27.685 --> 00:41:29.353

00:41:36.227 --> 00:41:38.229
THOSE PRIVILEGES. BUT IT ALSO

00:41:38.295 --> 00:41:39.663
PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK

00:41:39.730 --> 00:41:40.831
AT HOW WE IMPLEMENT THOSE

00:41:40.898 --> 00:41:43.167
TECHNOLOGIES GOING FORWARD AND

00:41:43.234 --> 00:41:45.402
IDEALLY REDUCE THE- THE NUMBER

00:41:55.613 --> 00:41:57.982
OF THE- I. THE OTHER THING IS

00:41:58.048 --> 00:41:58.883
TO YOU KNOW WHEN- MISTER ROWE

DRILL- YOU KNOW WHAT AN ATTACK

00:42:04.588 --> 00:42:06.590
IN RESPONSE LOOKS LIKE ARE YOU

00:42:06.657 --> 00:42:08.592
DON'T WANT TO FIGURE OUT- HOW

00:42:08.659 --> 00:42:09.727

00:42:09.793 --> 00:42:10.794
ATTACK WHEN YOU'RE ACTUALLY

00:42:10.861 --> 00:42:12.496

ADVOCATE THAT PAYING THE RANSOM

00:42:33.083 --> 00:42:34.652
BUT THE REALITY IS THAT YOU

00:42:34.718 --> 00:42:35.519
KNOW YOU MAY NEED TO THINK

00:42:35.586 --> 00:42:37.121
ABOUT THAT. AND ALSO IF YOU

00:46:00.524 --> 00:46:01.658
THEY'RE NOT CURRENTLY PREPARED

TO DEAL WITH THE ATTACKS BY

RANSOMWARE CRIMINAL GANGS ARE

00:46:04.161 --> 00:46:05.496
TARGETING THEIR ORGANIZATIONS

AS LEGITIMATE POLITICAL TARGETS.

00:46:14.805 --> 00:46:15.873
A RECENT REPORT FROM THE

00:46:21.912 --> 00:46:22.813
INCREASE IN CYBERATTACKS OVER

00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:24.348
THE LAST TWO YEARS. SOME COULD

00:46:24.414 --> 00:46:25.516
ARGUE THAT THIS IS ONLY BECAUSE

00:46:25.582 --> 00:46:26.683
WE ARE NOW LOOKING FOR THEIR

00:46:26.750 --> 00:46:28.552
THREATS BUT I WOULD DISAGREE. I

00:46:28.619 --> 00:46:29.019
THINK THERE HAS BEEN

00:46:29.086 --> 00:46:30.420
SIGNIFICANTLY MORE INTEREST IN

00:46:30.487 --> 00:46:31.822
ATTACKING THE FABRIC OF OUR

00:46:34.591 --> 00:46:36.226
PERSPECTIVE. AND ALSO AS A WAY

00:46:36.293 --> 00:46:37.528
TO CAUSE IMMEDIATE PAIN FOR

00:46:37.594 --> 00:46:39.363
FINANCIAL REWARD. I BELIEVE THE

00:46:39.429 --> 00:46:40.731
CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE ATTACKS

00:46:40.797 --> 00:46:41.532

00:46:57.314 --> 00:46:59.116
INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS. BUT

00:46:59.183 --> 00:46:59.883
I OFTEN DO HAVE THAT

00:46:59.950 --> 00:47:01.718
OPPORTUNITY BUT I'M SURE THIS

00:47:01.785 --> 00:47:03.820
COMMITTEE IS AWARE IN TWO

00:47:03.887 --> 00:47:04.354
THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THE LOS

00:47:04.421 --> 00:47:05.289
ANGELES DEPARTMENT OF WATER AND

00:47:05.355 --> 00:47:06.490
POWER CONDUCTED A PENETRATION

00:47:06.557 --> 00:47:08.058
TEST. TO DETERMINE THEIR

00:47:08.125 --> 00:47:08.692
SUSCEPTIBILITY TO BEING

00:47:08.759 --> 00:47:11.028
ATTACKED IS PUBLICLY REPORTED

00:47:11.094 --> 00:47:12.329
THAT ONLY TOOK SIX HOURS FOR

00:47:12.396 --> 00:47:13.830
THE EVALUATOR SUCCESSFULLY

00:47:13.897 --> 00:47:15.199
BREACHED THE NETWORK. BUT THERE

00:47:15.265 --> 00:47:19.303
IS CLEAR AND. PRESENT YOUR

00:47:19.369 --> 00:47:19.903
UTILITIES AROUND THE COUNTRY.

00:47:19.970 --> 00:47:21.004
AND WHILE UTILITIES AT ERICA

00:47:21.071 --> 00:47:24.274
SKATER JUST BEFORE. THE TWO

00:47:24.341 --> 00:47:25.075
THOUSAND TEN SPREAD OF STUXNET

00:47:25.142 --> 00:47:26.176
WHICH SUCCESSFULLY TARGETED

00:47:26.243 --> 00:47:28.145
IRANIAN CENTRIFUGES PROOF THE

00:47:28.212 --> 00:47:29.179
AIR GOT NETWORKS ARE NOT

00:47:29.246 --> 00:47:30.914
INFALLIBLE. THEY DEVELOPER

00:47:30.981 --> 00:47:32.616
PREVENT MANY NORMAL TAX. FOR

00:47:32.683 --> 00:47:34.184
SOMEONE AT SOME POINT WE'LL

00:47:34.251 --> 00:47:35.385
PLUG THEIR LAPTOP INTO BOTH

00:47:35.452 --> 00:47:36.987
NETWORKS TO DO THEIR JOBS OR

00:47:37.054 --> 00:47:38.322
THEY'LL TRANSFER THREAT B. R.

00:47:38.388 --> 00:47:39.790
U. S. B. ROCK. WE HAVE TO BE

00:47:39.856 --> 00:47:40.791
PREPARED FOR THIS TO HAPPEN

00:47:40.857 --> 00:47:42.226
BECAUSE THAT HAS HAPPENED AND

00:47:42.292 --> 00:47:44.061
IT WILL HAPPEN AGAIN. WITHOUT

00:47:44.127 --> 00:47:45.295
THREAT ACTORS ARE TARGETING

00:47:45.362 --> 00:47:46.296
THEIR ATTACKS WE'RE SEEING

00:47:46.363 --> 00:47:48.465
BOTH. TRULY TARGETED ATTACKS

00:47:48.532 --> 00:47:50.100
AND MORE COMMONLY TARGETS OF

00:47:50.167 --> 00:47:51.668
OPPORTUNITY. I BELIEVE THE

00:47:51.735 --> 00:47:52.836
MAJORITY OF ATTACKS SO WE SEE

00:47:52.903 --> 00:47:54.104
ON U. S. UTILITIES AND LOCAL

00:47:54.171 --> 00:47:55.472
GOVERNMENTS ARE THE SECOND

00:47:55.539 --> 00:47:57.140
VARIETY TARGETS OF OPPORTUNITY.

00:47:57.207 --> 00:47:58.375
BY USING INTERNET SCANNING

00:47:58.442 --> 00:47:59.910
TOOLS SUCH A SHOWDOWN ATTACKERS

00:47:59.977 --> 00:48:00.877
COMBINED VULNERABILITIES

00:48:00.944 --> 00:48:02.746
EXPOSED TO THE INTERNET. AND A

00:48:02.813 --> 00:48:03.680
TIME TO VARIETY OF DIFFERENT

00:48:03.747 --> 00:48:05.282
LOGGINS USING COMMONLY KNOWN

00:48:05.349 --> 00:48:07.251
PASSWORDS. OTHER TIMES CRITICAL

00:48:07.317 --> 00:48:08.452
INFRASTRUCTURE TARGETS ARE JUST

00:48:08.518 --> 00:48:10.020
PART OF A MUCH LARGER CAMPAIGN

00:48:10.087 --> 00:48:11.722
TO IN FACT ANYONE WHO COLLECTS.

00:48:11.788 --> 00:48:13.123
THE COLONIAL PIPELINE ATTACK

00:48:13.190 --> 00:48:15.259
MAYBE SUCH AN EXAMPLE BASED ON

00:48:15.325 --> 00:48:16.293
PUBLICLY VAILABLE INTELLIGENCE

00:48:16.360 --> 00:48:17.794
IF POSSIBLE THE DARKSIDE RANSOM

00:48:17.861 --> 00:48:19.463
GANG AFFILIATE THEY'RE NOT

00:48:19.529 --> 00:48:20.831
PURPOSELY TARGET THE COLONIAL

00:48:20.897 --> 00:48:22.666
PIPELINE. AS IT HAS APPARENTLY

00:48:22.733 --> 00:48:27.337
EXPOSED HIM TO UNWANTED. FOCUS

00:48:27.404 --> 00:48:28.038
FROM THE LAW ENFORCEMENT. WITH

TAX O'CONNOR. TO AND WHEN

00:48:31.375 --> 00:48:32.709
ADVERSARIES DO A TACTICAL

00:48:32.776 --> 00:48:34.211
INFRASTRUCTURE IT REPRESENTS A

00:48:34.278 --> 00:48:35.412
SIGNIFICANT THREAT TO OUR

00:48:35.479 --> 00:48:37.047
SAFETY AND NATIONAL SECURITY.

00:48:37.114 --> 00:48:37.814
STARTED OUR CRITICAL

00:48:37.881 --> 00:48:39.082
INFRASTRUCTURE COMPONENTS I

00:48:39.149 --> 00:48:39.950
WOULD RECOMMEND THAT YOU BILL

00:48:40.017 --> 00:48:42.386
THESE ADOPTING THE US ICS

00:48:42.452 --> 00:48:44.087
SEARCH LIST AFFECT PROCESS BEST

00:48:44.154 --> 00:48:45.756
PRACTICES. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

00:48:45.822 --> 00:48:47.624
SHOULD CONSIDER ADOPTING MISSED

00:48:47.691 --> 00:48:49.526
I ASKED TO USE RISK BASED

00:48:49.593 --> 00:48:50.927
CYBERSECURITY FRAMEWORK. IF

00:48:50.994 --> 00:48:52.229
ORGANIZATIONS FALL THESE

00:48:52.296 --> 00:48:53.664
PROTOCOLS AND CUSTOMER CONTROLS

00:48:53.730 --> 00:48:55.399
ON A REGULAR BASIS. EVER IN THE

00:48:55.465 --> 00:48:56.833
COUNTRY WOULD ACTUALLY BE MUCH

00:48:56.900 --> 00:48:58.435
MORE SAFE AS A RESULT. IN

00:48:58.502 --> 00:49:00.103
CONCLUSION UTILITIES AND LOCAL

00:49:00.170 --> 00:49:01.738
GOVERNMENTS ARE UNDENIABLY

00:49:01.805 --> 00:49:03.407

BIT LATE SO I APOLOGIZE IF MY

00:55:00.397 --> 00:55:02.232
QUESTIONS. HAVE ALREADY BEEN

00:55:02.298 --> 00:55:03.867
ANSWERED I DO HAVE A COUPLE OF

00:55:03.933 --> 00:55:05.902
QUESTIONS- I MADE A MANAGER OF

00:55:05.969 --> 00:55:08.571
FIRST QUESTION- IT'S MY

00:55:08.638 --> 00:55:11.041
UNDERSTANDING THAT- A LOT OF

00:55:11.107 --> 00:55:12.942
THE CRITICAL. INFRASTRUCTURE

00:55:13.009 --> 00:55:19.449
ASSETS. OR OTHERWISE AND MY

00:55:19.516 --> 00:55:22.352
QUESTION IS WHETHER OR NOT- HI

00:55:22.419 --> 00:55:23.119
YOU KNOW THAT PRESENTS A

00:55:23.186 --> 00:55:24.421
PROBLEM WHEN IT COMES TO

00:55:24.487 --> 00:55:26.256
NOTIFICATION OR WORKING WITH

00:55:26.322 --> 00:55:26.723
THE STATE OR FEDERAL

00:55:26.790 --> 00:55:28.458
GOVERNMENT- BECAUSE SOMETIMES

00:55:28.525 --> 00:55:29.926
PRIVATE SECTORS OFF ARE

00:55:29.993 --> 00:55:31.361
UNCOMFORTABLE SHARING CERTAIN

00:55:31.428 --> 00:55:33.129
INFORMATION- PARTICULARLY UP

00:55:33.196 --> 00:55:34.898
ABOUT CYBER SECURITY BREACHES

00:55:34.964 --> 00:55:37.033
AND THE LIKE. AND YET WHETHER

00:55:37.100 --> 00:55:39.269
OR NOT- YOU KNOW THAT FACT I

00:55:39.335 --> 00:55:41.304
EAT- YOU KNOW THESE ASSETS ARE

00:55:41.371 --> 00:55:43.440
BEING- OWN PRIVATELY- WOULD

00:55:43.506 --> 00:55:45.809
PRESENT- ANY CHALLENGES IN AND

00:55:45.875 --> 00:55:47.677
IF SO WHAT ARE SOME OF THE-

00:55:47.744 --> 00:55:49.913
POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS- TO ADDRESS

00:55:49.979 --> 00:55:51.781
THAT- WHY DON'T WE START WITH

00:55:51.848 --> 00:55:54.884
MISTER A- CANCEL. AND THEN IF

00:55:54.951 --> 00:55:58.021
ANYBODY ELSE HAS ANYTHING ELSE

00:55:58.088 --> 00:56:01.591
TO ADD AND- SURE AND THANK YOU

00:56:01.658 --> 00:56:04.627
FOR THAT QUESTION- SO- I.

00:56:04.694 --> 00:56:06.196
PERSONALLY DO NOT BELIEVE THAT

00:56:06.262 --> 00:56:09.065
THE PRESENTATION- YOU KNOW IN

00:56:09.132 --> 00:56:11.301
HERE THAT'S- ON THE SHARING YOU

00:56:11.367 --> 00:56:12.802
KNOW THE ELECTRICITY SECTOR HAS

00:56:12.869 --> 00:56:14.437
A LONG TRACK RECORD OF TAKING

00:56:14.504 --> 00:56:16.940
CYBERSECURITY RISK OR- SECURITY

00:56:17.006 --> 00:56:19.676
RISK IN GENERAL VERY SERIOUSLY-

00:56:19.743 --> 00:56:21.511
AND ACTUALLY HAS BEEN SHARING-

00:56:21.578 --> 00:56:23.747
ON FOR. WELL OVER TWO DECADES

00:56:23.813 --> 00:56:25.048
YOU KNOW INFORMATION ABOUT THIS

00:56:25.115 --> 00:56:26.850
RATIONALE AND THAT CONTINUES TO

00:56:26.916 --> 00:56:28.418
INCREASE THAT BEING SAID THE

00:56:28.485 --> 00:56:30.754
OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE SHARING

00:56:30.820 --> 00:56:31.755
AND MAINTAINING SITUATIONAL

00:56:31.821 --> 00:56:34.824
AWARENESS. EXISTS AND SO WE TRY

00:56:34.891 --> 00:56:36.292
TO DO THAT BY DEMONSTRATING THE

00:56:36.359 --> 00:56:37.694
VALUE OF INFORMATION SHARING

00:56:37.761 --> 00:56:39.529
WHICH IS REALLY MAINTAINING

00:56:39.596 --> 00:56:41.297
SITUATIONAL AWARENESS RIGHT.

00:56:41.364 --> 00:56:42.699
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS TO ONE OF

00:56:42.766 --> 00:56:44.534
US COULD HAPPEN TO ANOTHER ONE

00:56:44.601 --> 00:56:47.170
OF OUR MEMBERS- AND THAT IS

00:56:47.237 --> 00:56:49.139
REALLY WHAT THE ISAC FOCUSES ON

00:56:49.205 --> 00:56:49.873
IN TERMS OF GETTING

00:56:49.939 --> 00:56:52.642
INFORMATION. OUT TO THAT THAT

00:56:52.709 --> 00:56:54.778
BEING SAID- YES THAT THERE IS

00:56:54.844 --> 00:56:56.012
YOU KNOW OCCASIONALLY SOMEONE

00:56:56.079 --> 00:56:57.247
LOCKED THEMSELVES THE PRICKLY

00:56:57.313 --> 00:56:58.782
WHERE THERE'S CONCERNS ABOUT

00:56:58.848 --> 00:57:02.385
ATTRIBUTION. OR PENALTY OR OR-

00:57:02.452 --> 00:57:05.021
OTHER LIABILITIES THAT MADE HER

00:57:05.088 --> 00:57:05.789
AND I THINK THAT'S THE

00:57:05.855 --> 00:57:07.257
OPPORTUNITY IN FRONT OF US THAT

00:57:07.323 --> 00:57:08.591
WE HAVE TO YOU KNOW GIVEN THE

00:57:08.658 --> 00:57:10.560
SOPHISTICATION OF THE STRAP. WE

00:57:10.627 --> 00:57:12.796
ACTING CAN ENCOURAGE. ALL THE

00:57:12.862 --> 00:57:14.464
PARTIES IN THIS ECOSYSTEM TO

00:57:14.531 --> 00:57:17.400
CONTINUE TO SHARE- OUR WITH AND

00:57:17.467 --> 00:57:20.069
WITHOUT FEAR- ATTRIBUTION OR

00:57:20.136 --> 00:57:23.206
PENALTY- AND REALLY TRY TO

00:57:23.273 --> 00:57:25.175
FACILITATE THAT. SO ONE OF

00:57:25.241 --> 00:57:26.276
THINGS WE DO TO THAT END OF THE

00:57:26.342 --> 00:57:28.278
E. ISAC IS OUR MEMBERS CAN

00:57:28.344 --> 00:57:30.313
ACTUALLY SHARE ANONYMOUSLY THEY

00:57:30.380 --> 00:57:31.514
CAN POST INFORMATION ON OUR

00:57:31.581 --> 00:57:33.149
PORTAL. AND THEY CAN ACTUALLY

00:57:33.216 --> 00:57:34.751
CHOOSE WHO GETS SHARED WELL

00:57:34.818 --> 00:57:36.219
RIGHT AND WE THINK THAT'S A

00:57:36.286 --> 00:57:38.054
POWERFUL WAY OF AGAIN- GETTING

00:57:38.121 --> 00:57:39.923
INFORMATION AND THEN ALLOWING

00:57:39.989 --> 00:57:42.325
US TO- SHARE THAT INFORMATION

00:57:42.392 --> 00:57:43.526
WITH OTHER MEMBERS OF THE

00:57:43.593 --> 00:57:49.833
SECTOR. AND EVEN WITH OUR

00:57:49.899 --> 00:57:50.667
GOVERNMENT PARTNERS AS WELL. HE

00:57:50.733 --> 00:57:53.303
HAD COME YES YOU- NEXT QUESTION

00:57:53.369 --> 00:57:55.271
I DEALS WITH BRANDS. AND I

00:57:55.338 --> 00:57:57.207
THINK AS THE PANELISTS SO HAVE

00:57:57.273 --> 00:57:58.575
POINTED OUT IN THE YOU KNOW

00:57:58.641 --> 00:57:59.943
THAT THE FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY

00:58:00.009 --> 00:58:02.278
OF THESE RANSOMWARE ATTACK SO-

00:58:02.345 --> 00:58:03.613
ON ON ON THE RICE-

00:58:03.680 --> 00:58:05.782
EXPONENTIALLY IN FACT. AND I

00:58:05.849 --> 00:58:07.650
NOTICED ALSO THAT- A LOT OF

00:58:07.717 --> 00:58:08.852
THESE RANSOMWARE SITUATIONS

00:58:08.918 --> 00:58:10.687
INVOLVE. THE USE OF A

00:58:10.753 --> 00:58:12.121
CRYPTOCURRENCY CAL THEY'RE

00:58:12.188 --> 00:58:14.057
BEING T. PAY BY BITCOIN AND THE

00:58:14.123 --> 00:58:16.092
LIKE. AND SO I'M WONDERING IN

00:58:16.159 --> 00:58:18.328
ADDITION TO ALL THE SUGGESTIONS

00:58:18.394 --> 00:58:19.362
THAT'S BEEN MADE OF FOR

00:58:19.429 --> 00:58:22.031
EXAMPLE- HAVING- BEST PRACTICES

00:58:22.098 --> 00:58:23.800
AND THE LIKE. BUT IN HAVING

00:58:23.867 --> 00:58:25.869
BACKUP SO OBVIOUSLY. I'M

00:58:25.935 --> 00:58:27.704
WONDERING WHETHER ONE OF THE-

00:58:27.770 --> 00:58:30.039
POSSIBLE AVENUES TO PURSUE

00:58:30.106 --> 00:58:31.941
WOULD BE TO LOOK AT THE YOU

00:58:32.008 --> 00:58:34.077
KNOW THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF THE

00:58:34.143 --> 00:58:36.312
CRYPTOCURRENCY- INFRASTRUCTURE

00:58:36.379 --> 00:58:38.815
BASICALLY. AND YOUR DO

00:58:38.882 --> 00:58:40.984
SOMETHING VERY IT YOU KNOW FOR

00:58:41.050 --> 00:58:42.085
EXAMPLE WHATEVER THE CASE MAYBE

00:58:42.151 --> 00:58:44.254
IT. WOULD BE DISCLOSURE OR

00:58:44.320 --> 00:58:46.456
OTHERWISE SO IS THAT SOMETHING

00:58:46.522 --> 00:58:50.526
THAT WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT AS.

00:58:50.593 --> 00:58:51.094
WELL EITHER THE STATE OR THE

00:58:51.160 --> 00:58:54.497
FEDERAL LEVEL. AT AN- LET'S

00:58:54.564 --> 00:58:57.734
SEE- THAT PERHAPS A- MISTER

00:58:57.800 --> 00:59:05.575
CLARK MANY. YEAH. REGARDING THE

00:59:05.642 --> 00:59:07.010
DESTRUCTION OF THE CRITICAL

00:59:07.076 --> 00:59:08.378
INFRASTRUCTURE I WOULD SAY FROM

00:59:08.444 --> 00:59:09.479
A RANSOMWARE POINTED TO DO

00:59:09.545 --> 00:59:10.947
YOU'RE YOU'RE CERTAINLY CORRECT

00:59:11.014 --> 00:59:14.817
YOUR PERSON THAT THE- OR SORRY

00:59:14.884 --> 00:59:17.153
A SIMPLE PERSON. THAT THE-

00:59:17.220 --> 00:59:18.054
RANSOMWARE PAYMENTS ARE

00:59:18.121 --> 00:59:19.222
CURRENTLY BEING PAID

00:59:19.289 --> 00:59:20.556
SIGNIFICANTLY WITH CRYPTO COIN

00:59:20.623 --> 00:59:22.225
THE BERRIES VARIETIES HOWEVER I

00:59:22.292 --> 00:59:23.192
CAN'T SAY THAT I'M EXPERT

00:59:23.259 --> 00:59:25.528
ENOUGH TO COMMENT UPON THE

00:59:25.595 --> 00:59:26.663
ABILITY DISRUPT THOSE MARKET

00:59:26.729 --> 00:59:28.498
PLACES. ARE SPECIFICALLY

00:59:28.564 --> 00:59:29.666
BECAUSE SOME OF THE CRYPTOCOIN

00:59:29.732 --> 00:59:31.634
MARKETS ARE DESIGNED TO

00:59:31.701 --> 00:59:32.969
SPECIFICALLY AVOID GOVERNMENT

00:59:33.036 --> 00:59:35.204
REGULATION AND EVERYTHING ALONG

00:59:35.271 --> 00:59:36.172
THOSE LINES SO IT BECOMES

00:59:36.239 --> 00:59:37.540
DIFFICULT. BECAUSE THERE ARE A

00:59:37.607 --> 00:59:38.875
VARIETY OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF

00:59:38.942 --> 00:59:40.677
CRYPTO COINS THAT ARE USED ARE

00:59:40.743 --> 00:59:41.577
THE MOST COMMON OF COURSE HAS

00:59:41.644 --> 00:59:43.446
BEEN BIG POINT. WHICH WE CAN

00:59:43.513 --> 00:59:45.081
SEE FROM THE- RECENT COLONIAL

00:59:45.148 --> 00:59:47.383
PIPELINE AND THE DARK SIDE TAKE

00:59:47.450 --> 00:59:48.851
DOWN BY THE US GOVERNMENT THAT

00:59:48.918 --> 00:59:51.254
THEY WERE ACTUALLY ABLE TO

00:59:51.321 --> 00:59:52.455
RECOVER SOME OF THAT- IT

00:59:52.522 --> 00:59:53.623
APPEARS THAT MANY RANSOMWARE

00:59:53.690 --> 00:59:54.624
OPERATORS ARE BEGINNING TO MOVE

00:59:54.691 --> 00:59:56.159
AWAY FROM BITCOIN AS PRIMARY

00:59:56.225 --> 00:59:57.493
PAYMENT METHOD BECAUSE OF THAT

00:59:57.560 --> 00:59:59.595
DISRUPTION SO- THAT'S MOST PARK

00:59:59.662 --> 01:00:00.496
ON COMFORTABLE GOING INTO

01:00:00.563 --> 01:00:01.998
DETAILS BUT I CAN'T SAY FOR

01:00:02.065 --> 01:00:04.200
SIGNIFICANT DIFFICULTIES WITH

01:00:04.267 --> 01:00:05.969
DISRUPTING THAT MARKHAM. AS OF

01:00:06.035 --> 01:00:07.670
MAYBE MR BOUCHARD HAS SOMETHING

01:00:07.737 --> 01:00:12.475
TO ADD ON THAT. YES I MEAN FROM

01:00:12.542 --> 01:00:14.277
OUR PERSPECTIVE WE WE'VE

01:00:14.344 --> 01:00:14.711
ACTUALLY HAD SEVERAL

01:00:14.777 --> 01:00:18.614
DISCUSSIONS- WITH CITY COUNCIL

01:00:18.681 --> 01:00:20.616
AS WELL AS- YOUR CONGRESS ON

01:00:20.683 --> 01:00:22.318
THIS TOPIC AND THERE IS. A

01:00:22.385 --> 01:00:24.320
GROWING THOUGHT PROCESS THAT

01:00:24.387 --> 01:00:27.056
THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME SORT OF-

01:00:27.123 --> 01:00:28.324
BUT YOUR REGULATED OR NO

01:00:28.391 --> 01:00:30.793
DISCLOSURE NOTIFICATION OF

01:00:30.860 --> 01:00:31.294
PAYMENT THERE HAVE BEEN

01:00:31.361 --> 01:00:33.129
DISCUSSED. SINS OF THE OF

01:00:33.196 --> 01:00:34.230
BANNING FORMER IN SOMEWAY

01:00:34.297 --> 01:00:35.865
OUTLAWING SOME PAYMENTS IN

01:00:35.932 --> 01:00:39.202
ORDER TO CUT OFF THE FINANCE

01:00:39.268 --> 01:00:39.936
BOB DOLE THAT SPENDING.

01:00:40.003 --> 01:00:42.071
CREASING EXPONENTIAL WE- TALKED

01:00:42.138 --> 01:00:42.905
ABOUT EARLIER THAT OF COURSE

01:00:42.972 --> 01:00:44.507
PUTS A LOT OF VICTIMS IN

01:00:44.574 --> 01:00:45.708
JEOPARDY WHEN IT COMES TO

01:00:45.775 --> 01:00:47.910
RECOVERY OF. THEIR OPERATIONS

01:00:47.977 --> 01:00:49.379
AND THEIR SYSTEMS UNFORTUNATELY

01:00:49.445 --> 01:00:51.681
SO THIS IS INTELLIGENT THE

01:00:51.748 --> 01:00:53.750
PROBLEM I DON'T KNOW THAT-

01:00:53.816 --> 01:00:56.386
REGULATION OF THE CRYPTO MARKET

01:00:56.452 --> 01:00:59.122
WILL NESSA'S DEARLY BEAR FRUIT

01:00:59.188 --> 01:00:59.956
ESPECIALLY IN THE TIME FRAME

01:01:00.023 --> 01:01:01.124
THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MAYBE

01:01:01.190 --> 01:01:02.892
THAT'S A- A LONGER TERM

01:01:02.959 --> 01:01:05.028
ADDRESSABLE. PROBLEM SAID I

01:01:05.094 --> 01:01:06.796
THINK IN THE SHORT TERM SOME

01:01:06.863 --> 01:01:09.732
SORT OF POTENTIAL- LIABILITY

01:01:09.799 --> 01:01:11.467
PROTECTION OR SHIELDING ALONG

01:01:11.534 --> 01:01:14.737
WITH DISCLOSURE- EITHER PRIOR

01:01:14.804 --> 01:01:15.671
TO OR IMMEDIATELY AFTER A

01:01:15.738 --> 01:01:17.173
RANSOM PAYMENT IN ORDER TO

01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:18.474
ENABLE LAW ENFORCEMENT TO

01:01:18.541 --> 01:01:21.144
BETTER TRACK. AND PROSECUTE

01:01:21.210 --> 01:01:22.812
THESE SORTS OF PAYMENTS MAY BE

01:01:22.879 --> 01:01:24.814
A MIDDLE GROUND THAT- THAT

01:01:24.881 --> 01:01:26.816
MAKES SENSE INTO TO STEM THE

01:01:26.883 --> 01:01:29.052
TIDE. HE DOES THAT THE AND THE

01:01:29.118 --> 01:01:30.253
FUNDING THAT'S FLOWING IN AND

01:01:30.319 --> 01:01:32.488
FRANKLY ENABLING- THE

01:01:32.555 --> 01:01:34.624
INCREASING AMOUNT OF CYBER- YOU

01:01:34.690 --> 01:01:38.461
KNOW OPERATIONS. THAT WERE SEEN

01:01:38.528 --> 01:01:39.495
AGAINST CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE.

01:01:39.562 --> 01:01:40.396
THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND ONE

01:01:40.463 --> 01:01:41.731
FINAL QUESTION AND I THINK ONE

01:01:41.798 --> 01:01:43.466
OF THE PANELISTS- TALKED A

01:01:43.533 --> 01:01:44.934
LITTLE BIT ABOUT SEGMENTATION

01:01:45.001 --> 01:01:47.003
SO FOR CLARIFICATION PURPOSES

01:01:47.070 --> 01:01:48.471
I'M JUST WONDERING IF DOT

01:01:48.538 --> 01:01:50.506
CONCEPT REALLY. UP ENCOMPASSES

01:01:50.573 --> 01:01:54.444
OR- SIMPLY MEANS THAT WE ARE

01:01:54.510 --> 01:01:57.280
SECOND SEGMENTING VARIOUS PARTS

01:01:57.346 --> 01:01:59.182
OF THIS OF THE NETWORK SO THAT.

01:01:59.248 --> 01:02:01.317
A ONE IF INFECTED SEGMENT WOULD

01:02:01.384 --> 01:02:04.620
NOT. AFFECT OTHER SEGMENTS OF

01:02:04.687 --> 01:02:06.589
YOU KNOW OF THE OF THE SYSTEM-

01:02:06.656 --> 01:02:07.190
WITHIN THE INFRASTRUCTURE JUST

01:02:07.256 --> 01:02:12.161
A- CONVOCATION QUESTION. MAYBE

01:02:12.228 --> 01:02:15.965
MR CANCEL ON THAT ONE. SURE-

01:02:16.032 --> 01:02:19.602
SO- SEGMENTATION- IS AS YOU

01:02:19.669 --> 01:02:22.171
POINT OUT IS CERTAINLY A- A

01:02:22.238 --> 01:02:24.107
METHOD TO PREVENT FURTHER

01:02:24.173 --> 01:02:26.542
INFECTIONS- YOU KNOW TO KEEP

01:02:26.609 --> 01:02:28.344
INFECTIONS YOU KNOW WELL

01:02:28.411 --> 01:02:29.979
LOCATED WHERE IT STARTED AND

01:02:30.046 --> 01:02:31.447
NOT NECESSARILY TRAVERSING

01:02:31.514 --> 01:02:33.049
LATTERLY WHEN YOU'RE ON THE

01:02:33.116 --> 01:02:34.283
OTHER- Q. VANTAGE THE

01:02:34.350 --> 01:02:36.519
SEGMENTATION IS REALLY RESTRICT

01:02:36.586 --> 01:02:39.188
ACCESS RIGHT AND SO AGAIN IN

01:02:39.255 --> 01:02:40.323
THE ELECTRICITY SECTOR THERE'S

01:02:40.389 --> 01:02:41.891
BEEN A LONG TIME PRACTICE OF

01:02:41.958 --> 01:02:44.494
SEGMENTING THE ENERGY DELIVERY

01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:45.194
NETWORKS OF THE CONTROL THAT

01:02:45.261 --> 01:02:47.196
WORKS. FROM THE ENTERPRISE

01:02:47.263 --> 01:02:48.831
NETWORKS I'M SO THAT REMAINS A

01:02:48.898 --> 01:02:50.967
BEST PRACTICE RIGHT ALL THE

01:02:51.033 --> 01:02:52.468
CHALLENGED AREAS SO IT'S OUR

01:02:52.535 --> 01:02:54.704
ADVERSARIES HAVE PROVEN IS THAT

01:02:54.770 --> 01:02:57.039
THEY CAN GET BACK- GET PAST

01:02:57.106 --> 01:02:58.608
THAT YOU KNOW WHAT YOU DID THEY

01:02:58.674 --> 01:03:00.042
GET THROUGH MISCONFIGURED

01:03:00.109 --> 01:03:01.410
SYSTEMS SO THEY AKE ADVANTAGE

01:03:01.477 --> 01:03:04.247
OF VULNERABILITIES. THAT EXIST

01:03:04.313 --> 01:03:05.848
IN THOSE PLATFORM SO THAT'S WHY

01:03:05.915 --> 01:03:07.583
IT'S IMPORTANT TO MAINTAIN

01:03:07.650 --> 01:03:09.685
SOFTWARE CURRENCY AND PATCH

01:03:09.752 --> 01:03:12.088
SYSTEMS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE-

01:03:12.155 --> 01:03:13.789
AND THAT'S WHAT ENABLED THEM TO

01:03:13.856 --> 01:03:15.658
GET ACCESS THE OTHER THING AND

01:03:15.725 --> 01:03:16.626
WE SAW THIS IN THE COLONIAL

01:03:16.692 --> 01:03:19.996
PIPELINE ATTACK WHERE AGAIN BE

01:03:20.062 --> 01:03:22.064
OPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS

01:03:22.131 --> 01:03:22.932
WERE NOT COMPROMISED BY THE

01:03:22.999 --> 01:03:25.401
RANSOMWARE BUT KEY ENTERPRISE

01:03:25.468 --> 01:03:27.270
SYSTEMS THAT WERE YOU KNOW

01:03:27.336 --> 01:03:29.539
CRITICAL TO THE OPERATION. OF

01:03:29.605 --> 01:03:31.340
THOSE SYSTEMS WERE COMPROMISED

01:03:31.407 --> 01:03:33.176
SO YOU KNOW WE WOULD ENCOURAGE

01:03:33.242 --> 01:03:34.744
ENTERPRISES TO REALLY TAKE A

01:03:34.810 --> 01:03:36.946
LOOK AT THEIR INVENTORY OF

01:03:37.013 --> 01:03:38.514
APPLICATIONS IN THE SASH WHICH

01:03:38.581 --> 01:03:40.349
APPLICATIONS ON THE CORPORATE

01:03:40.416 --> 01:03:41.918
NETWORK OR ENTERPRISE NETWORKS

01:03:41.984 --> 01:03:49.692
ARE CRITICAL TO THE OPERATION.

01:03:49.759 --> 01:03:50.293
OF THE OPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY

01:03:50.359 --> 01:03:50.960

WOULD BE CALLED THE SMALL TO

01:05:44.106 --> 01:05:45.474
MEDIUM SIZED OUR WATER AND

01:05:45.541 --> 01:05:47.710
WASTEWATER UTILITY WE ARE

BY A FIVE MEMBER ELECTED BOARD%

01:05:58.854 --> 01:06:01.290
OF DIRECTORS. WHAT I'LL DO IT

01:06:01.357 --> 01:06:02.792
IN A VERY BRIEF WAY IF YOU

01:06:02.858 --> 01:06:06.062
HAVE- GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF THREE

01:06:06.128 --> 01:06:08.597
MAJOR TRENDS THAT I SEE HI IN

01:06:08.664 --> 01:06:10.766
TERMS OF OUR CYBER SECURITY

01:06:10.833 --> 01:06:12.802
POSTURE OF WATER AND WASTEWATER

01:06:12.868 --> 01:06:15.638
UTILITIES ARE SIMILAR TO MINE.

01:06:15.705 --> 01:06:17.873
HI AND- THAT MAY BE HELPFUL IN

01:06:17.940 --> 01:06:20.176
FURTHERING THE DISCUSSION. THE

01:06:20.242 --> 01:06:21.477
FIRST TREND THAT I WANTED TO

01:06:21.544 --> 01:06:23.446
POINT OUT WHICH I WOULD SAY IS

01:06:23.512 --> 01:06:25.581
A VERY POSITIVE ONE IS THAT- I

01:06:25.648 --> 01:06:27.717
AM SEEING A SUBSTANTIAL

01:06:27.783 --> 01:06:30.653
INCREASE IN FOCUS AMONG LEADERS

01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:32.154
AND ELECTED OFFICIALS

01:06:32.221 --> 01:06:33.823
RESPONSIBLE FOR WATER AND

01:06:33.889 --> 01:06:35.891
WASTEWATER UTILITIES ON. CYBER

01:06:35.958 --> 01:06:37.860
THREAT AND THE IMPORTANCE OF

01:06:37.927 --> 01:06:39.895
INVESTMENT IN CYBER SECURITY

01:06:39.962 --> 01:06:41.764
AND THAT'S REALLY EIGHT OF OUR

01:06:41.831 --> 01:06:42.531
USUAL THING AND A HELPFUL

01:06:42.598 --> 01:06:44.934
THING- AND I THINK THIS COMES

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:46.569
IN TWO FORMS ONE IN TERMS OF

01:06:46.635 --> 01:06:48.938
LITERACY AND SO MYSELF I AM NOT

01:06:49.004 --> 01:06:50.740
AN I. T. PROFESSIONAL- WATER

01:06:50.806 --> 01:06:53.409
AGENCY MANAGER. BUT I SEE AN

01:06:53.476 --> 01:06:55.611
INCREASE LITERACY AMONG MY

01:06:55.678 --> 01:06:57.346
COLLEAGUES AND ALSO OUR ELECTED

01:06:57.413 --> 01:07:03.886
BOARD. ON CYBER SECURITY. BOB

01:07:03.953 --> 01:07:06.021
THE DAYS ARE CYPRUS. ARE BEING

01:07:06.088 --> 01:07:07.723
I. T. FOR ARE ARE LONG. AND

01:07:07.790 --> 01:07:10.025
CYPRUS NOW IS AN IMPORTANT

01:07:10.092 --> 01:07:12.128
STRATEGIC PRIORITY OF ANY

01:07:12.194 --> 01:07:14.830
UTILITY INCLUDING MY OWN- FOR

01:07:14.897 --> 01:07:17.066
MY UTILITY WE CONSIDER. ARE

01:07:17.133 --> 01:07:19.135
PREPARING AND RESPONDING FOR

01:07:19.201 --> 01:07:21.504
THE THREAT OF CYBER ATTACK AS

01:07:21.570 --> 01:07:23.739
RISING TO BE ON PAR WITH THOSE

01:07:23.806 --> 01:07:26.308
FROM NATURAL DISASTER AND THOSE

01:07:26.375 --> 01:07:27.576
WOULD BE FIRE EARTHQUAKE AND

01:07:27.643 --> 01:07:29.678
FLOOD. AND I OPERATE IN AN AREA

01:07:29.745 --> 01:07:32.148
OF THE STATE WHERE OP FIRES A

01:07:32.214 --> 01:07:33.849
SIGNIFICANT THREAT. THERE'S

01:07:33.916 --> 01:07:35.718
REALLY TWO DRIVERS ONE IS THAT

01:07:35.785 --> 01:07:36.786
WERE SEEN AN INCREASED

01:07:36.852 --> 01:07:39.588
FREQUENCY AND- THE CROWD. AND

01:07:39.655 --> 01:07:40.790
IT'S REALLY AN OCCURRENCE

01:07:40.856 --> 01:07:43.659
THAT'S ALMOST DAILY- DALY MAYBE

01:07:43.726 --> 01:07:45.961
ON A SMALLER SCALE OF FISHING

01:07:46.028 --> 01:07:47.463
AND THAT TYPE OF THING BUT

01:07:47.530 --> 01:07:48.631
THESE ARE THREATS THAT ARE

01:07:48.697 --> 01:07:52.067
ROUTINE NOW- AND RELATED TO- BE

01:07:52.134 --> 01:07:54.170
TAKEN SERIOUSLY. AND ALSO WE'VE

01:07:54.236 --> 01:07:57.039
SEEN INCREASED OUR FOCUS- AT

01:07:57.106 --> 01:07:58.574
THE LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY

01:07:58.641 --> 01:08:00.609
LEVEL ON ENSURING THAT

01:08:00.676 --> 01:08:02.978
UTILITIES ARE I'M DOING A GOOD

01:08:03.045 --> 01:08:05.047
JOB IN TERMS OF PREPARING BOB

01:08:05.114 --> 01:08:06.282
THAT HAS HAPPENED AT THE

01:08:06.348 --> 01:08:08.050
FEDERAL LEVEL- BEGINNING

01:08:08.117 --> 01:08:09.285
FOLLOWING THE NINE ELEVEN

01:08:09.351 --> 01:08:11.487
ATTACKS AND THAT WAS THE TWO

01:08:11.554 --> 01:08:12.221
THOUSAND AND TWO. BIOTERRORISM

01:08:12.288 --> 01:08:14.356
ACT AND I WOULD SAY IN THE TEN

01:08:14.423 --> 01:08:15.157
YEARS THAT FOLLOWED THAT THERE

01:08:15.224 --> 01:08:16.859
WASN'T A BIG FOCUS ON THE

01:08:16.926 --> 01:08:18.861
PHYSICAL SECURITY. OF MORE

01:08:18.928 --> 01:08:21.630
RECENTLY CONGRESS PASSED THE

01:08:21.697 --> 01:08:22.498
TWENTY EIGHTEEN AMERICA'S WATER

01:08:22.565 --> 01:08:24.667
INFRASTRUCTURE ACT. AND THAT

01:08:24.733 --> 01:08:27.303
HAS REALLY. BROADENED THAT THE

01:08:27.369 --> 01:08:29.939
FOCUS OF THE BIOTERRORISM ACT

01:08:30.005 --> 01:08:32.107
TO INCLUDE- IN MORE EARNEST

01:08:32.174 --> 01:08:34.510
CYBER SECURITY AND- WATER

01:08:34.577 --> 01:08:36.545
AGENCIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA AND

01:08:36.612 --> 01:08:38.280
ACROSS THE COUNTRY HAVE NOW.

01:08:38.347 --> 01:08:40.749
INCORPORATED RISK ASSESSMENTS

01:08:40.816 --> 01:08:41.784
AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE

01:08:41.851 --> 01:08:44.119
PROCEDURES IN ORDER TO RESPOND

01:08:44.186 --> 01:08:46.522
TO THOSE THREATS. SO THE SECOND

01:08:46.589 --> 01:08:48.524
TREND- THAT I WANTED TO MENTION

01:08:48.591 --> 01:08:52.261
IS A TREND OF MOVING. TOWARDS

01:08:52.328 --> 01:08:55.030
INCREASED RELIANCE IN WATER

01:08:55.097 --> 01:08:55.531
WASTEWATER UTILITIES ON

01:08:55.598 --> 01:08:58.200
AUTOMATION. MORE SOPHISTICATED

01:08:58.267 --> 01:09:03.439
INDUSTRIAL CONTROL. SYSTEMS ARE

01:09:03.506 --> 01:09:05.441
CLOUDBASE AS COMPUTING AND THEN

01:09:05.508 --> 01:09:06.108
MOST RECENTLY ARTISTS AND

01:09:06.175 --> 01:09:07.676
MACHINE LEARNING. AND SO THIS

01:09:07.743 --> 01:09:09.678
COMES WITH TWO PARTS IT COMES

01:09:09.745 --> 01:09:12.748
IN NOT THE FORM OF NEW RISK. IN

01:09:12.815 --> 01:09:14.583
THAT HOT ALL OF THESE SYSTEMS

01:09:14.650 --> 01:09:16.719
PRESENT NEW POINTS OF ENTRY

01:09:16.785 --> 01:09:20.422
POTENTIALLY TO- OUR SYSTEMS AND

01:09:20.489 --> 01:09:22.658
CAN PRESENT NEW THREATS. BUT

01:09:22.725 --> 01:09:24.460
ALSO PRESENTS OPPORTUNITIES TO

01:09:24.527 --> 01:09:25.794
WORK WITH COMPANIES WHO ARE

01:09:25.861 --> 01:09:28.731
INDUSTRY LEADERS AND WHO EMPLOY

01:09:28.797 --> 01:09:30.266
MORE SOPHISTICATED SECURITY

01:09:30.332 --> 01:09:32.334
SYSTEMS THEN WHAT WE WOULD.

01:09:32.401 --> 01:09:34.069
NORMALLY BE ABLE TO IN OUR OWN

01:09:34.136 --> 01:09:37.573
UTILITIES SO- IT COMES WITH-

01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:40.276
BOTH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE- IT

01:09:40.342 --> 01:09:41.677
ALSO REALLY ELEVATES THE

01:09:41.744 --> 01:09:43.379
IMPORTANCE OF SELECTING

01:09:43.445 --> 01:09:46.015
PARTNERS AND CONSIDERING OUR

01:09:46.081 --> 01:09:48.684
SECURITY. AND THE CAPABILITY OF

01:09:48.751 --> 01:09:50.219
YOUR PARTNERS IN PROVIDING

01:09:50.286 --> 01:09:51.820
SECURITY FOR BOTH YOUR

01:09:51.887 --> 01:09:54.657
OPERATIONS AND YOUR SYSTEMS.

01:09:54.723 --> 01:09:56.058
AND THEN I JUST WANTED TO ADD

01:09:56.125 --> 01:09:58.327
THE THIRD MAJOR TREND- WHICH IS

01:09:58.394 --> 01:10:00.129
A CHALLENGE IS THAT WE ARE

01:10:00.195 --> 01:10:01.430
FACING IN THE INDUSTRY AND

01:10:01.497 --> 01:10:03.866
INCREASED. INCREASING COST

01:10:03.933 --> 01:10:05.901
ACROSS THE BOARD AND AT THE

01:10:05.968 --> 01:10:07.736
SAME TIME AND INCREASED FOCUS

01:10:07.803 --> 01:10:09.905
ON PROVIDING AFFORDABLE SERVICE

01:10:09.972 --> 01:10:12.174
AND SO INVESTMENTS IN

01:10:12.241 --> 01:10:13.609
CYBERSECURITY DO COME WITH THAT

01:10:13.676 --> 01:10:15.210
CHALLENGE IN THE CONTEXT OF

01:10:15.277 --> 01:10:18.280
RISING COSTS. TO PROVIDE YOU TO

01:10:18.347 --> 01:10:20.215
UTILITY SERVICES IN GENERAL.

01:10:20.282 --> 01:10:21.216
AND TRYING TO PROVIDE

01:10:21.283 --> 01:10:24.053
AFFORDABLE SERVICE AND SO WHAT

01:10:24.119 --> 01:10:26.255
I'M FINDING IS THAT- FREQUENTLY

01:10:26.322 --> 01:10:28.524
UTILITIES LIKE MINE- WHEN WE DO

01:10:28.591 --> 01:10:31.160
CONDUCT A RISK ASSESSMENT. WE

01:10:31.226 --> 01:10:32.962
NEED TO EMPLOY AN EMPLOYMENT

01:10:33.028 --> 01:10:34.630
THE RESPONSE MEASURES AND

01:10:34.697 --> 01:10:36.699
IMPROVEMENTS TO SECURITY OVER A

01:10:36.765 --> 01:10:39.201
PERIOD OF TIME. AND SOMETIMES

01:10:39.268 --> 01:10:40.869
THOSE CAN BE COSTLY I

01:10:40.936 --> 01:10:42.371
PARTICULARLY IN TERMS OF

01:10:42.438 --> 01:10:44.840
HIRING- THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE

01:10:44.907 --> 01:10:47.876
EXPERTISE IN THESE AREAS- AND-

01:10:47.943 --> 01:10:49.578
IN THE CASE OF A SMALLER AGENCY

01:10:49.645 --> 01:10:52.047
LIKE MINE THAT I CAN BE. A

01:10:52.114 --> 01:10:55.217
CHALLENGE SO I THANK YOU FOR-

01:10:55.284 --> 01:10:56.018
OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE

01:10:56.085 --> 01:11:00.990

AS GOVERNMENT ENTITIES USE THE

01:12:55.704 --> 01:12:57.606
NECESSARY SECURITY FRAMEWORK SO

THAT FRAMEWORK OVER THE LAST

01:13:18.727 --> 01:13:22.731
FIVE YEARS- WE ALSO HAVE BEEN-

01:13:22.798 --> 01:13:25.667
SPURRED ALONG BY. A REGULATION

01:13:25.734 --> 01:13:27.603

THOSE SYSTEMS WE'VE RECENTLY

01:13:55.864 --> 01:13:58.834
SEEN- REALLY ON THE HEELS OF

01:13:58.901 --> 01:14:00.936
THE COLONIAL PIPELINE INCIDENT

01:14:01.003 --> 01:14:03.672
THAT'S BEEN TALKED ABOUT TODAY-

01:14:03.739 --> 01:14:04.873
THAT DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND

UNDERSTAND AND HAVE BEEN ABLE

01:14:20.255 --> 01:14:21.824
TO SEE IT DROPPED OUT MORE

01:14:21.890 --> 01:14:28.463
STRINGENT- REGULATIONS. THAT

ARE REAL HELPED. OUT SICK

01:14:32.768 --> 01:14:35.571
ORGANISED. NOW GAS PI- VERY

01:14:35.637 --> 01:14:37.472
GOOD IDEA WE WILL DO EVERYTHING

01:14:37.539 --> 01:14:40.175
WE CAN TO CHEW UP- MEET THOSE

01:14:40.242 --> 01:14:43.812
STANDARDS- COUPLE MORE ITEMS-

OUR CASE TRANSFORMERS

01:14:55.023 --> 01:14:57.860
ELECTRONIC RELAYS ARM SOFTWARE

01:14:57.926 --> 01:15:00.495
TO MANAGE OUR ENVIRONMENT SO-

01:15:00.562 --> 01:15:03.699
IT'S NOT JUST US UTILITIES ARE

01:15:03.765 --> 01:15:05.067
WHO REALLY NEED TO STEP UP TO

01:15:05.133 --> 01:15:07.002
THE CHALLENGE IT'S- IT'S OUR

VERY STRINGENT SUPPLY CHAIN

01:15:13.342 --> 01:15:15.644
SECURITY CONTROLS SO THAT WHEN

01:15:15.711 --> 01:15:17.613
WE DO PURCHASE FOR EXAMPLE A

01:15:17.679 --> 01:15:20.082
NETWORK MONITORING SOLUTION- WE

FROM THAT WE ALSO HAVE THE NEXT

01:20:39.467 --> 01:20:40.702
FRAMEWORK AGAIN IT'S NOT

01:20:40.769 --> 01:20:42.504
REGULATORY HOWEVER IT'S

01:20:42.571 --> 01:20:44.439

01:20:56.685 --> 01:20:57.586
THEN THERE'S OTHERS LIKE THE

AUSTRALIAN ESSENTIAL EIGHT

01:20:59.254 --> 01:21:00.622
WHICH ARE. ESSENTIALLY

01:21:00.689 --> 01:21:02.357
RECOMMENDATIONS WRITING BEST

01:21:02.424 --> 01:21:04.526
PRACTICES IN SO WE CONSTANTLY

01:21:04.593 --> 01:21:06.027
LOOK AT ALL OF THOSE RIGHT WE

01:21:06.094 --> 01:21:07.929
WE'RE WE DON'T FOCUS ON ONE

01:21:07.996 --> 01:21:11.132
IT'S KIND OF LIKE A DEFENSE IN

01:21:11.199 --> 01:21:12.867
AT ALL OF THOSE BEST PRACTICES

01:21:12.934 --> 01:21:15.370

A BUSINESS. THIS AS YOU KNOW

01:21:19.841 --> 01:21:21.343
WHAT WE'VE SEEN OVER THE LAST

01:21:21.409 --> 01:21:23.211
YEAR OR TWO CERTAINLY FROM THE

01:21:23.278 --> 01:21:25.146
PANDEMIC AS MANY PEOPLE WHAT

01:21:25.213 --> 01:21:27.249
REMOTE. WE DIDN'T SEE A HUGE

01:21:27.315 --> 01:21:29.317
INCREASE IN THREATS AGAINST OUR

01:21:29.384 --> 01:21:31.553
USERS WE SAW A CHANGE IN THE

01:21:31.620 --> 01:21:33.588
THREATS AGAINST OUR USERS.

01:21:33.655 --> 01:21:35.190
BECAUSE PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC

01:21:35.257 --> 01:21:37.058
WE WERE SEEING LOTS OF SPAM

01:21:37.125 --> 01:21:38.293
MALWARE THAT WAS COMING THROUGH

01:21:38.360 --> 01:21:40.095
EMAIL IN CERTAINLY SINCE THE

01:21:40.161 --> 01:21:41.997
PANDEMIC IN THE LAST YEAR WE'VE

01:21:42.063 --> 01:21:44.799
SEEN A LOT OF THAT SHIFT INTO

01:21:44.866 --> 01:21:46.234
CREDENTIAL HARVESTING RIGHT

01:21:46.301 --> 01:21:47.602
WHERE. FISHING IN A TRYING TO

01:21:47.669 --> 01:21:48.770
GET CREDENTIALS SO THAT THEY

01:21:48.837 --> 01:21:50.972
CAN GAIN REMOTE ACCESS INTO

01:21:51.039 --> 01:21:53.008
SOME OF OUR ENVIRONMENTS. AND

01:21:53.074 --> 01:21:54.843
IN IN THE POTENTIALLY DO

01:21:54.909 --> 01:21:55.710
FURTHER HARM FROM THEIR FROM

01:21:55.777 --> 01:21:58.947
THEIR- ADDITIONAL YOU KNOW THE

01:21:59.014 --> 01:22:00.615
THINGS THAT WE'VE SEEN IS YOU

01:22:00.682 --> 01:22:02.484
KNOW ATTACKERS QUICKLY

01:22:02.550 --> 01:22:04.619
LEVERAGING. VULNERABILITIES AS

01:22:04.686 --> 01:22:06.721
THEY ARE DISCLOSED RIGHT THAT

01:22:06.788 --> 01:22:07.689
HAS ALWAYS BEEN A PRACTICE

01:22:07.756 --> 01:22:10.425
HOWEVER IN THE LAST YEAR OR TWO

01:22:10.492 --> 01:22:12.661
WE CLEARLY SEEN VULNERABILITIES

01:22:12.727 --> 01:22:14.262
THAT HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED

01:22:14.329 --> 01:22:16.298
MEANING. THE PRODUCT

01:22:16.364 --> 01:22:17.932
MANUFACTURERS COME OUT AND SAID

01:22:17.999 --> 01:22:18.967
YOU KNOW THIS PRODUCT HAS A

01:22:19.034 --> 01:22:21.836
VULNERABILITY WITHIN THE NEXT

01:22:21.903 --> 01:22:22.370
TWENTY FOUR TO THIRTY SIX

01:22:22.437 --> 01:22:24.039
HOURS. THERE IS A HUGE INCREASE

01:22:24.105 --> 01:22:27.142
IN ATTACKER ACTIVITY TRYING TO

01:22:27.208 --> 01:22:28.076
FIND COMPANIES WITH THAT

01:22:28.143 --> 01:22:29.744
PARTICULAR OWN ABILITY TO TRY

01:22:29.811 --> 01:22:31.346
TO GET THEIR FOOT IN THE DOOR.

01:22:31.413 --> 01:22:33.214
BEFORE THAT ORGANIZATION

01:22:33.281 --> 01:22:35.483
PATCHES THAT VULNERABILITY AND

01:22:35.550 --> 01:22:36.785
THAT IS THAT IS WHAT LET HAS

01:22:36.851 --> 01:22:38.053
LED TO SEVERAL MAJOR

01:22:38.119 --> 01:22:40.889
COMPROMISES IN THE LAST. BOB

01:22:40.955 --> 01:22:41.489
YOU KNOW SIX MONTHS WITH MANY

01:22:41.556 --> 01:22:44.159
ORGANIZATIONS- MARTIN ALSO

01:22:44.225 --> 01:22:46.261
DESCRIBED YOU KNOW. CYBER THIRD

01:22:46.328 --> 01:22:48.096
PARTY SUPPLY CHAIN RISK HAS

01:22:48.163 --> 01:22:50.432
BEEN A HUGE INCREASE ESPECIALLY

01:22:50.498 --> 01:22:50.932
BECAUSE OF DUE TO THEIR

01:22:50.999 --> 01:22:53.435
RANSOMWARE ATTACK. YOU KNOW AS

01:22:53.501 --> 01:22:54.936
MANY OF YOUR WHERE YOU KNOW

01:22:55.003 --> 01:22:56.137
RANSOMWARE TYPICALLY INVOLVES

01:22:56.204 --> 01:22:57.539
AN EXTORTION TACTIC WHERE THEY

01:22:57.605 --> 01:22:59.974
STEAL DATA AND EVEN THOUGH YOU

01:23:00.041 --> 01:23:00.809
MIGHT HAVE THE ABILITY TO

01:23:00.875 --> 01:23:02.811
RECOVER. THEY WILL THEY WILL

01:23:02.877 --> 01:23:04.512
PUBLICLY DISCLOSE THAT DATA.

01:23:04.579 --> 01:23:07.182
AND SO SUDDENLY NOW WE HAVE TO

01:23:07.248 --> 01:23:09.150
PROTECT OURSELVES BUT ALSO OUR

01:23:09.217 --> 01:23:11.086
VENDORS AND OUR THIRD PARTIES

01:23:11.152 --> 01:23:12.620
WHO MIGHT GET TO BE A VICTIM OF

01:23:12.687 --> 01:23:14.322
A OF A RANSOMWARE ATTACK. THEY

01:23:14.389 --> 01:23:15.657
MIGHT HAVE SOME OF OUR DATA AND

01:23:15.724 --> 01:23:20.028
THAT DATA GET STOLEN. AND THEN

01:23:20.095 --> 01:23:20.628
THAT DATA BECOMES PART OF YOU

01:23:20.695 --> 01:23:21.429
DISTORTION PACKED. SO SHE

01:23:21.496 --> 01:23:23.431
INCREASE IN THIRD. SUPPLY CHAIN

01:23:23.498 --> 01:23:25.834
RISK- AND THEN THE LAST ONE I

01:23:25.900 --> 01:23:28.036
MENTION ABOUT IT IN INCREASES

01:23:28.103 --> 01:23:29.204
IT IS THE DENIAL OF SERVICE

01:23:29.270 --> 01:23:30.939
ATTACKS OVER THE LAST YEAR OR

01:23:31.005 --> 01:23:32.440
SO WE'VE SEEN A HUGE INCREASE

01:23:32.507 --> 01:23:34.042
ACROSS UTILITIES AS WELL AS

01:23:34.109 --> 01:23:35.910
OTHER SECTORS LIKE FINANCIAL.

01:23:35.977 --> 01:23:37.779
HEALTH CARE IT CONTINUES TO BE

01:23:37.846 --> 01:23:39.714
A PROBLEM IN FACT THERE WAS ONE

01:23:39.781 --> 01:23:42.016
TODAY AGAINST ANOTHER UTILITY-

01:23:42.083 --> 01:23:43.351

CUSTOMER PROTECTIONS AND

01:26:57.412 --> 01:26:58.379
GREATER SECURITY RATHER THAN

01:26:58.446 --> 01:27:00.148
DEVELOPING THIS PROCESS IS A

01:27:00.214 --> 01:27:02.317
REAL TIME. TO BE AFFECTED

01:27:02.383 --> 01:27:03.785
HOWEVER OUR WORK ON THE

01:27:03.851 --> 01:27:04.852
STRATEGY MUST CONTINUE TO

01:27:04.919 --> 01:27:06.721
EVOLVE AT A PACE FASTER THAN

01:27:06.788 --> 01:27:08.556
THE THREATS WE'RE FACING NOW

01:27:08.623 --> 01:27:11.359
AND INTO THE FUTURE. LASTLY WE

01:27:11.426 --> 01:27:12.894
MANAGE THE HUMAN SIDE OF RISK

01:27:12.961 --> 01:27:13.928
BY INVENTING SECURITY DOOR

FISHING OR HUMAN ERROR ALL THE

01:27:19.968 --> 01:27:21.002
TOOLS IN THE WORLD WILL NOT

01:27:21.069 --> 01:27:22.570
STOP COMPROMISED OR STAFF IS

01:27:22.637 --> 01:27:25.139
NOT YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO IF THEY

01:27:25.206 --> 01:27:26.541
RECEIVE A SUSPICIOUS EMAIL.

01:27:26.608 --> 01:27:27.742
EDISON WE BELIEVE MUST BE

01:27:27.809 --> 01:27:29.777
INSTINCTIVE AND SECOND NATURE

01:27:29.844 --> 01:27:31.479
SO WE HAVE A ROBUST AWARENESS

01:27:31.546 --> 01:27:33.681
PROGRAMS SUPPORT THIS GOAL.

01:27:33.748 --> 01:27:35.316
FINALLY I WANT TO CLOSE BY

01:27:35.383 --> 01:27:36.784
STATING THE CONCEPT OF

01:27:36.851 --> 01:27:37.919
CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT IS THE

01:27:37.986 --> 01:27:39.354
BEDROCK OF THE CHILI SECTOR

01:27:39.420 --> 01:27:41.122
BECAUSE WE RECOGNIZE THE

INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS ACROSS

01:27:47.929 --> 01:27:49.530
THE COUNTRY. THIS IS WHY IT'S

01:27:49.597 --> 01:27:50.565
SO IMPORTANT THAT WE PARTNER

01:27:50.632 --> 01:27:52.634
CLOSELY WITH FEDERAL STATE AND

01:27:52.700 --> 01:27:54.369
LOCAL AGENCIES RECOGNIZING

01:27:54.435 --> 01:27:56.504
ORCHID POWER. IS AN INSTRUMENT

01:27:56.571 --> 01:27:58.006
OF NATIONAL AND ECONOMIC

01:27:58.072 --> 01:27:59.707
SECURITY AND THEREFORE WE MUST

01:27:59.774 --> 01:28:00.775
DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO PROTECT

01:28:00.842 --> 01:28:02.377
AGAINST CYBER ADVERSARIES THAT

01:28:02.443 --> 01:28:03.945
WE WERE SCHOLAR IN WISCONSIN

MIGHT BENEFIT FROM UPSKILLING

01:29:07.341 --> 01:29:10.478
PROGRAMMES SO- WILL CONTINUE WE

01:29:10.545 --> 01:29:12.313
WILL CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON THAT

01:29:12.380 --> 01:29:14.882
