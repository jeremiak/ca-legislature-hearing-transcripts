00:30:18.249 --> 00:30:18.983
AND THERE ARE MANY INDIVIDUALS

00:30:19.050 --> 00:30:19.417

REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRATION STATUS?

00:59:32.001 --> 00:59:33.770
SEE UNDOCUMENTED CALIFORNIANS

00:59:33.836 --> 00:59:35.571
ARE CALIFORNIANS IN EVERY SENSE

00:59:35.638 --> 00:59:36.673
OF THE WORD.

00:59:36.739 --> 00:59:37.941

DOLLARS IN TAXES EVERY YEAR.

00:59:40.710 --> 00:59:43.012

THEY ARE SHUT OUT FROM

RIGHT NOW WE HAVE A SYSTEM THAT

00:59:52.388 --> 00:59:53.790
IS UNFAIR AND CRUEL.

00:59:53.856 --> 00:59:56.059
APPROXIMATELY THIRTY FIVE

00:59:56.125 --> 00:59:57.460
THOUSAND CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS

THEY ARE FORCED TO GO TO THE

01:00:02.999 --> 01:00:05.268
EMERGENCY ROOM FOR CARE.

01:00:05.335 --> 01:00:07.036
OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IS

01:00:07.103 --> 01:00:09.872
STRONGER AND MORE COST EFFICIENT

01:00:09.939 --> 01:00:11.808
WELL WE DETECT AND TREAT

01:00:11.874 --> 01:00:14.110
PREVENTABLE CONDITIONS EARLY.

01:00:14.177 --> 01:00:16.279
RATHER THAN FORCE PATIENTS TO

01:00:16.346 --> 01:00:18.014
RESORT TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM FOR

01:00:18.081 --> 01:00:19.382
CARE.

01:00:19.449 --> 01:00:22.385
STUDIES SHOW EMERGENCY CARE COST

01:00:22.452 --> 01:00:24.187
THREE TIMES MORE THAN PRIMARY

01:00:24.253 --> 01:00:26.255
CARE AND THAT PEOPLE PUT OFF

01:00:26.322 --> 01:00:29.158
CARE UNTIL THEY ACTUALLY GET

01:00:29.225 --> 01:00:30.560
MUCH MORE BILL.

01:00:30.626 --> 01:00:32.595
THAT IS NO WAY TO TREAT PEOPLE

01:00:32.662 --> 01:00:34.931
WHO HAVE WORKED REYES FAMILIES

01:00:34.998 --> 01:00:37.567
AND PAY THEIR SHARE AND TAXES.

01:00:37.633 --> 01:00:38.935
OUR ELDERS ARE FORCED TO

01:00:39.002 --> 01:00:40.503
CONTINUE TO WORK.

01:00:40.570 --> 01:00:41.804
MOST HAVE CHILDREN GRAND

01:00:41.871 --> 01:00:44.440
CHILDREN SPOUSES WHO ARE US

01:00:44.507 --> 01:00:46.242
CITIZENS AND RESIDENTS.

01:00:46.309 --> 01:00:48.745
CALIFORNIA IMMIGRANTS ARE 34% OF

01:00:48.811 --> 01:00:51.447
THE WORK FORCE TWICE THE

01:00:51.514 --> 01:00:52.982
NATIONAL ELDER AVERAGE.

01:00:53.049 --> 01:00:53.850
SOME OF OUR ELDERS HAVE BEEN

01:00:53.916 --> 01:00:55.518
WAITING FOR MORE THAN THIRTY

01:00:55.585 --> 01:00:57.387
YEARS FOR A SOLUTION FROM

01:00:57.453 --> 01:01:00.223
WASHINGTON TO NO AVAIL.

01:01:00.289 --> 01:01:01.791
MANY ARE HELPING TO RAISE THE

01:01:01.858 --> 01:01:04.293
NEXT GENERATION OF CALIFORNIANS.

01:01:04.360 --> 01:01:06.429
KNOW ELDER SHOULD SUFFER OR DIE

01:01:06.496 --> 01:01:07.897
FROM A TREATABLE CONDITION

01:01:07.964 --> 01:01:10.800
BECAUSE OF WHERE THEY WERE BORN.

01:01:10.867 --> 01:01:12.402
TODAY COLLEAGUES WE HAVE AN

01:01:12.468 --> 01:01:14.704
OPPORTUNITY TO TO ACT AND MOVED

EVEN CLOSER. TO COVERING ALL

01:01:17.106 --> 01:01:18.741
PEOPLE IN OUR STATE.

01:01:18.808 --> 01:01:20.543
I KNOW THIS MEASURE REQUIRES

01:01:20.610 --> 01:01:22.211
FUNDING TO BE IMPLEMENTED

01:01:22.278 --> 01:01:24.847
HOWEVER NOTHING SHOULD STOP US

01:01:24.914 --> 01:01:27.750
FROM MAKING A POLICY DECISION.

01:01:27.817 --> 01:01:29.152
IT SHOULD NO LONGER BE A

01:01:29.218 --> 01:01:31.187
QUESTION ABOUT WHY WE NEED TO

01:01:31.254 --> 01:01:33.089
COVER THIS POPULATION BUT

01:01:33.156 --> 01:01:35.591
INSTEAD HOW WE PROVIDE CARE TO

01:01:35.658 --> 01:01:37.393
OUR MOST VULNERABLE SENIORS.

01:01:37.460 --> 01:01:40.930
I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT TO STOP

01:01:40.997 --> 01:01:43.399
THE BAN ON OUR SENIORS -- AND WE

01:01:43.466 --> 01:01:46.402
HAVE SOME EXPERTS WHO WILL BE

REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRATION STATUS.

01:02:08.458 --> 01:02:09.492
CALIFORNIA'S TWO POINT TWO

01:02:44.293 --> 01:02:45.294
WHICH ONLY COVERS EMERGENCIES

01:02:45.361 --> 01:02:46.496
AND ONLY STABILIZE THE PATIENT

01:02:46.562 --> 01:02:47.964
IT DOESN'T TREAT IT MIGHT BE A

01:02:48.030 --> 01:02:49.232
CHRONIC CONDITION SUCH AS THIS --

01:02:49.298 --> 01:02:51.434
DIABETES OR HEART DISEASE OR

EVEN IF SOMETHING LIKE CANCER IT

01:02:53.169 --> 01:02:54.170

PARTS OF THE STATE THE CARE IS

01:03:04.981 --> 01:03:06.082
NONEXISTENT.

01:03:06.149 --> 01:03:06.716
AS A RESULT MANY UNDOCUMENTED

01:03:06.782 --> 01:03:08.084
SENIORS ARE LIVING SICKER AND

01:03:08.151 --> 01:03:09.619

BY PASSING AS BETWEEN NINE WE

01:03:15.625 --> 01:03:16.859

ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE WHEN THEY

01:03:18.528 --> 01:03:19.428
NEED IT REGARDLESS OF WHERE THEY

01:03:19.495 --> 01:03:22.532
WERE BORN. FOR THESE REASONS WE

01:03:25.201 --> 01:03:26.035
GOOD AFTERNOON CHEN MEMBER

STEVEN BACK NATION WITH THE

CALIFORNIA IMMIGRANT POLICY

CENTER -- CO SPONSOR OF SB

01:03:30.573 --> 01:03:31.841
TWENTY NINE I'M NOT TOO LONG AGO

01:03:31.908 --> 01:03:33.376
WE HEARD A STORY FROM SOMEONE

01:03:33.442 --> 01:03:34.410
WHO REACHED OUT TO US WHOSE

01:03:34.477 --> 01:03:35.878
MOTHER WAS IN THE HOSPITAL DUE

01:03:35.945 --> 01:03:37.346
TO CANCER -- SHE WAS ON

01:03:37.413 --> 01:03:39.515
RESTRICTED SCOPE MEDI CAL AND

01:03:39.582 --> 01:03:40.316
WASN'T ABLE TO ACCESS THE

01:03:40.383 --> 01:03:41.817
SERVICES TO ACTUALLY GET THE

01:03:41.884 --> 01:03:43.252
TRANSPLANT THAT SHE NEEDED

01:03:43.319 --> 01:03:44.587
BECAUSE THE CANCER GOTTEN SO

01:03:44.654 --> 01:03:47.023
SEVERE -- WHICH REQUIRED EITHER

01:03:47.089 --> 01:03:48.991
FULL SCOPE OR PRIVATE INSURANCE.

01:03:49.058 --> 01:03:49.592
I TWO WEEKS LATER SHE PASSED

01:03:49.659 --> 01:03:50.593
AWAY.

01:03:50.660 --> 01:03:52.428
UNFORTUNATELY THIS STORY IS NOT

01:03:52.495 --> 01:03:54.297
UNIQUE -- THIS HAPPENS IN

01:03:54.363 --> 01:03:55.364
IMMIGRANT FAMILIES ACROSS THE

01:03:55.431 --> 01:03:57.433
STATE ON A DAILY BASIS AND AND

01:03:57.500 --> 01:03:58.968
WE DO HEAR THOSE STORIES.

01:03:59.035 --> 01:04:01.204
I WE TRULY DO BELIEVE THAT NO

01:04:01.270 --> 01:04:03.506
ONE SHOULD GET A DEATH SENTENCE

01:04:03.573 --> 01:04:05.074
JUST BECAUSE OF WHERE THEY WERE

01:04:05.141 --> 01:04:06.709
BORN EVERYONE DOES DESERVE

01:04:06.776 --> 01:04:08.711
ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE -- BUT

01:04:08.778 --> 01:04:09.679
UNFORTUNATELY FOR THOSE SENIORS

01:04:09.745 --> 01:04:11.347
THAT ARE LOW INCOME WHICH MANY

01:04:11.414 --> 01:04:12.915
OF THEM ARE LIVING IN IMMIGRANT

01:04:12.982 --> 01:04:15.284
FAMILIES -- IT'S A REALITY THAT

01:04:15.351 --> 01:04:17.220
ESCAPES THEM -- UNDER THIS

01:04:17.286 --> 01:04:18.287
PARTICULAR CLIMATE -- OUR

01:04:23.092 --> 01:04:24.660
CONCERNS WITH PHYSICAL HEALTH

01:04:24.727 --> 01:04:26.596
CONCERNS AND WE JUST SEE THE

01:04:26.662 --> 01:04:28.431
CRITICAL NATURE HOW URGENT IT IS

01:04:28.497 --> 01:04:29.832
TO PROVIDE HEALTHCARE THAT IS

01:04:29.899 --> 01:04:32.168

COVERING PEOPLE.

01:12:43.258 --> 01:12:45.060

THEMSELVES AND DIE UNNECESSARILY.

01:12:49.231 --> 01:12:49.998

01:12:50.065 --> 01:12:51.934
MADE WITH THIS VERY UNEQUAL

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:53.802

01:12:57.039 --> 01:12:59.575

01:12:59.641 --> 01:13:01.710
COST OF DOING NOTHING.

WE'RE ABLE TO TRANSFER HIM TO

WATCHING -- TO CLOSE FAMILY

MEMBERS DIE OF CANCER -- AND

01:29:46.748 --> 01:29:48.850
BEING THERE WHEN THEY DIED -- IT

01:29:48.916 --> 01:29:50.818
WAS NOT PRETTY.

01:29:50.885 --> 01:29:52.553
IT WAS NOT IT WAS NOT IT WAS

01:29:52.620 --> 01:29:56.124
MANY YEARS AGO -- AND BEFORE

01:29:56.190 --> 01:29:59.026
REALLY EVEN MEDICAL CANNABIS WAS --

01:29:59.093 --> 01:30:02.563
SOMETHING THAT IS WAS EVEN

01:30:02.630 --> 01:30:05.166
ACCEPTED IN CALIFORNIA -- I'VE

01:30:05.233 --> 01:30:06.234
BEEN A STRONG PROPONENT OF

01:30:06.300 --> 01:30:07.735
MEDICAL CANNABIS INDEED WAS ONE

01:30:07.802 --> 01:30:08.903
THE FIRST THINGS I START TO WORK

01:30:08.970 --> 01:30:09.771
ON WHEN I CAME TO THE

01:30:09.837 --> 01:30:11.506
LEGISLATURE -- NEARLY FIVE YEARS

01:30:11.572 --> 01:30:17.979
AGO -- MY CONCERNS WERE -- ABOUT --

01:30:18.045 --> 01:30:19.247
THE POSSIBILITY THAT FEDERAL

01:30:19.313 --> 01:30:20.748
GOVERNMENT COULD COME IN AND AND

01:30:20.815 --> 01:30:22.617
THE FACT.

01:30:22.683 --> 01:30:24.285
HOSPITAL OPERATIONS SHOULD THEY

01:30:24.352 --> 01:30:27.655
CHOOSE TO DO THAT -- I BELIEVE

01:30:27.722 --> 01:30:30.525
THAT -- WHILE THE AMENDMENTS ARE

01:30:30.591 --> 01:30:31.893
NOT EXACTLY WHAT YOU MIGHT BE

01:30:31.959 --> 01:30:33.361
LOOKING.

01:30:33.427 --> 01:30:34.695
FOR I THINK THAT THAT IS HELPFUL

01:30:34.762 --> 01:30:36.764
BUT I WILL SAY THAT I WILL

01:30:36.831 --> 01:30:39.500
REMAIN OPEN OPEN. TO AMENDMENT

01:30:39.567 --> 01:30:40.668
SHOULD WE FIND A WAY THAT

01:30:40.735 --> 01:30:42.103
CLARIFIES TO STRENGTHEN

01:30:42.170 --> 01:30:43.738
STRENGTHEN THIS -- IN IN SOME

01:30:43.805 --> 01:30:46.274
WAY GOING FORWARD -- AND I KNOW

01:30:46.340 --> 01:30:47.842
THAT'S NOT NORMALLY WAY WE DO

01:30:47.909 --> 01:30:48.810
THAT BUT I WANT TO ASSURE YOU IF

01:30:48.876 --> 01:30:50.178
THERE'S THERE'S ADDITIONAL

01:30:50.244 --> 01:30:51.445
INFORMATION COMES FORWARD.

01:30:51.512 --> 01:30:52.947
I WOULD BE OPEN TO DISCUSSING

01:30:53.014 --> 01:30:55.616
THAT AS AS AS THE BILL CONTINUES

01:30:55.683 --> 01:31:01.022
TO MOVE -- IT IS -- ALMOST IT

01:31:01.088 --> 01:31:02.156
REALLY AT THIS DAY AND AGE IT IS

01:31:02.223 --> 01:31:04.158
UNCONSCIONABLE THAT WE CANNOT

01:31:04.225 --> 01:31:07.195
PROVIDE THIS FOR SOMEONE IN NEED --

01:31:07.261 --> 01:31:08.930
SO THEY CAN SPEND THE QUALITY

01:31:08.996 --> 01:31:10.498
TIME THEY DESERVE WITH THEIR

01:31:10.565 --> 01:31:13.234

THIS THIS LAW IS REVOLUTIONARY

01:31:58.679 --> 01:32:00.047

YEARS LATER -- WHEN I WAS

02:18:06.411 --> 02:18:08.747
NEED A CONSTITUENT CAME FORWARD?

02:18:08.813 --> 02:18:10.415
WITH A STORY ABOUT BEING

02:18:10.482 --> 02:18:12.450
CONTACTED BY A RESEARCHER BEFORE

02:18:12.517 --> 02:18:14.252
SHE HAD EVEN DECIDED TO TELL HER

02:18:14.319 --> 02:18:15.620
FAMILY ABOUT HER DIAGNOSIS OF

02:18:15.687 --> 02:18:18.256
CANCER -- FOR WHATEVER REASON

02:18:18.323 --> 02:18:19.724
THIS CONSTITUENT HAD DECIDED TO

02:18:19.791 --> 02:18:22.127
KEEP HER DIAGNOSIS -- PERSONAL

02:18:22.193 --> 02:18:22.794
TERCEL SHE HADN'T EVEN TOLD HER

02:18:22.861 --> 02:18:25.330
MOM -- THE SHE HAD CANCER.

02:18:25.397 --> 02:18:27.732
AND WHEN SHE WAS CONTACTED BY A

02:18:27.799 --> 02:18:29.167
RESEARCHER OUT OF THE BLUE --

02:18:29.234 --> 02:18:31.603
SHE WAS UNDERSTANDABLY FURIOUS

02:18:31.670 --> 02:18:32.671
THAT SOMEBODY KNEW ABOUT HER

02:18:32.737 --> 02:18:34.639
DIAGNOSIS WITHOUT HER HAVING

02:18:34.706 --> 02:18:36.241
EVER SHARED.

02:18:36.307 --> 02:18:37.776
SHE HAD NO IDEA HOW THE

02:18:37.842 --> 02:18:39.144
RESEARCHER GOT HER INFORMATION

02:18:39.210 --> 02:18:40.445
BECAUSE SHE WAS UNAWARE THAT THE

02:18:40.512 --> 02:18:42.881
CANCER REGISTRY EXISTED.

02:18:42.947 --> 02:18:44.549
LET ALONE THAT IT HELD HER

02:18:44.616 --> 02:18:46.418
PERSONAL AND MEDICAL INFORMATION.

02:18:46.484 --> 02:18:48.219
I WAS SURPRISED ALSO BECAUSE AS

02:18:48.286 --> 02:18:49.788
A CANCER SURVIVOR MYSELF I WAS

02:18:49.854 --> 02:18:51.356

02:18:53.892 --> 02:18:55.293
SURE ENOUGH I WROTE TO THE

REGISTRY AND FOUND OUT THAT THEY

02:18:56.695 --> 02:18:57.862

TO THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH.

02:19:14.412 --> 02:19:15.814
I AM NOT DENYING THAT PHYSICIANS

02:19:15.880 --> 02:19:17.716
DO THIS BUT HOW MUCH DO THEY

02:19:17.782 --> 02:19:19.217

NECESSARY AND MAYBE IF IT'S

02:20:58.049 --> 02:20:58.950
DUPLICATIVE.

02:20:59.017 --> 02:21:00.819
HOW CAN YOU ADDRESS THAT SURE

02:21:00.885 --> 02:21:02.987

AND LAW AS A MATTER OF FACT.

02:21:05.690 --> 02:21:07.625
WHEN YOU ARE DIAGNOSED WITH

02:21:07.692 --> 02:21:10.962

02:21:11.029 --> 02:21:12.230

02:21:19.537 --> 02:21:20.405
REGISTRY.

02:21:20.471 --> 02:21:22.040
AND IN ADDITION TO THAT NOTIFY

02:21:22.106 --> 02:21:28.413
YOU ALSO THAT THIS IS HAPPENING --

02:21:28.479 --> 02:21:29.414
SO IF IN MY PERSONAL CASE IN IN

02:21:29.480 --> 02:21:30.381
THE CASE OF THE CONSTITUENT OF

02:21:30.448 --> 02:21:33.017
BROUGHT THIS FORWARD AND IT'S IN

02:21:33.084 --> 02:21:35.453
MY OWN PERSONAL POLL OF ASKING

02:21:35.520 --> 02:21:37.288
CANCER SURVIVORS MYSELF ABOUT

02:21:37.355 --> 02:21:38.990
THIS PRACTICE.

02:21:39.057 --> 02:21:41.059
I HAVE YET TO HAVE ONE CANCER

02:21:41.125 --> 02:21:42.393
SURVIVOR TELL ME.

02:21:42.460 --> 02:21:44.562
THAT THEY REMEMBER RECEIVING THE

02:21:44.629 --> 02:21:46.431
INFORMATION.

02:21:46.497 --> 02:21:48.333
ABOUT THE CANCER REGISTRY.

02:21:48.399 --> 02:21:49.200
AND I'M NOT GOING TO HEAR I'M

02:21:49.267 --> 02:21:50.435
NOT GONNA ARGUE TODAY THAT

02:21:50.501 --> 02:21:52.036
DOCTORS ARE NOT DOING THAT'S NOT

02:21:52.103 --> 02:21:53.404
WHAT I'M PROPOSING AT ALL I'M

02:21:53.471 --> 02:21:54.873
DOCTORS VERY WELL COULD BE DOING

02:21:54.939 --> 02:21:55.640
IT.

02:21:55.707 --> 02:21:56.908
BUT THAT INFORMATION DELIVERED

02:21:56.975 --> 02:21:58.910
AT SUCH A TUMULTUOUS TIME IN A

02:21:58.977 --> 02:22:00.612
CANCER.

02:22:00.678 --> 02:22:02.046
SURVIVORS LIFE THAT THEY'RE

02:22:02.113 --> 02:22:03.748
MISSING THAT INFORMATION FOR

02:22:03.815 --> 02:22:06.484
WHATEVER REASON -- SO.

02:22:06.551 --> 02:22:07.585
THE REASON THAT THIS BILL IS NOT

02:22:07.652 --> 02:22:10.154
DUPLICATE THIS IS BECAUSE IT IS.

02:22:10.221 --> 02:22:11.823
IN ADDITION TO THE PHYSICIAN

02:22:11.890 --> 02:22:13.358
BEING REQUIRED TO PROVIDE THE

02:22:13.424 --> 02:22:15.326
INFORMATION IS ALSO REQUIRING

02:22:15.393 --> 02:22:17.362
THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH.

02:22:17.428 --> 02:22:21.165
THE CANCER REGISTRY ITSELF -- TO

02:22:21.232 --> 02:22:22.500
LET.

02:22:22.567 --> 02:22:23.134
CANCER SURVIVORS NO WANTS THEIR

02:22:23.201 --> 02:22:24.435
INFORMATION IS ENTERED INTO THE

02:22:24.502 --> 02:22:26.237
SYSTEM THAT THEY ARE IN THAT

02:22:26.304 --> 02:22:28.306
SYSTEM THE BROCHURE TALKS ABOUT

02:22:28.373 --> 02:22:29.807
THE CANCER REGISTRY ALL THE

02:22:29.874 --> 02:22:31.276
POSITIVE THINGS THAT IT DOES.

02:22:31.342 --> 02:22:32.977
AND I THINK THAT'S RECEIVED AT A

02:22:33.044 --> 02:22:34.746
MORE OPPORTUNE TIME IN A CANCER

02:22:34.812 --> 02:22:36.214
SURVIVORS LIFE WHEN THEY'RE ABLE

02:22:36.281 --> 02:22:38.316
TO PAY ATTENTION TO THAT AND

02:22:38.383 --> 02:22:41.352
UNDERSTAND IT AND PROCESS IT

02:22:41.419 --> 02:22:41.653
[inaudible]

02:22:41.719 --> 02:22:46.557
ANYONE ELSE.

02:22:46.624 --> 02:22:47.525
OKAY OKAY.

02:22:47.592 --> 02:22:48.293
MY CONCERN IS IS THE CURRENT

02:22:48.359 --> 02:22:49.394
CONCERN HAS BEEN RAISED ABOUT

02:22:49.460 --> 02:22:50.828
POTENTIAL DUPLICATION AND MAYBE

02:22:50.895 --> 02:22:52.330
ADDED COSTS WITHOUT A ADDED

02:22:52.397 --> 02:22:53.698
VALUE SO SO YOU'RE SAYING RIGHT

02:22:53.765 --> 02:22:55.967
NOW AT THE EXISTING LAW REQUIRES.

02:22:56.034 --> 02:22:59.370
SHARING OF THE BROCHURE AT THAT.

02:22:59.437 --> 02:23:02.206
HOW THE EMOTIONAL MOMENT WHEN A

02:23:02.273 --> 02:23:03.708
CANCER SURVIVORS DISTRAUGHT?

02:23:03.775 --> 02:23:05.176
OF WHEN THE FIRST LEARNING ABOUT

02:23:05.243 --> 02:23:06.577
IT AND THAT'S NOT THE BEST TIME

02:23:06.644 --> 02:23:07.912
BUT YOUR BILL IS DIFFERENT

02:23:07.979 --> 02:23:10.081
BECAUSE IT REQUIRES THAT WHEN

02:23:10.148 --> 02:23:11.215
THAT THEIR NAME IS ADDED TO THE

02:23:11.282 --> 02:23:12.350
REGISTRY DEPARTMENT PUBLIC

02:23:12.417 --> 02:23:13.351
HEALTH NOTIFY.

02:23:13.418 --> 02:23:15.086
THE HAVE THAT RIGHT THAT IS

02:23:15.153 --> 02:23:17.088
CORRECT YES.

02:23:17.155 --> 02:23:17.689
SO WITH THE BE NOTIFIED BOTH

02:23:17.755 --> 02:23:19.457
TIMES.

02:23:19.524 --> 02:23:22.360
WELL I CAN'T -- I I I CAN'T

02:23:22.427 --> 02:23:24.929
ARGUE FOR THE PRACTICE OF THE

02:23:24.996 --> 02:23:27.265
PHYSICIANS ON WHEN THEY'RE GOING

02:23:27.332 --> 02:23:28.933
TO PRESENT THE INFORMATION.

02:23:29.000 --> 02:23:32.303
SO THIS BILL WOULD MAKE SURE.

02:23:32.370 --> 02:23:34.772
THAT TH THAT THE REGISTRY IS

02:23:34.839 --> 02:23:36.574
ACTIVE IN.

02:23:36.641 --> 02:23:38.876
PRODUCING THE BROCHURE AND

02:23:38.943 --> 02:23:40.878
MAILING IT OUT SO YOU KNOW.

02:23:40.945 --> 02:23:43.047
OR AT ONE OF THE OTHER ASPECTS

02:30:55.579 --> 02:30:57.681
GOT CURED AND THEN WENT AND

02:30:57.748 --> 02:30:59.383
STARTED THEIR FAMILY IT WOULD BE

02:30:59.450 --> 02:31:00.851
A MUCH MORE SMOOTH.

02:31:00.918 --> 02:31:02.653
TRANSITION WHAT I BELIEVE LESS

02:31:02.720 --> 02:31:04.321
OUT OF POCKET HEALTH COSTS SO

02:31:04.388 --> 02:31:06.056
WITH ME TODAY I HAVE A NUMBER OF

02:31:06.123 --> 02:31:07.625
EXPERTS WHO ARE GONNA TALK YOU

02:31:07.691 --> 02:31:12.029
THROUGH WHY THIS IS SO IMPORTANT

02:31:12.096 --> 02:31:12.630
AND WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR

02:31:12.696 --> 02:31:15.966
AN ABOUT.

02:31:16.033 --> 02:31:17.868
THAT'S A GOOD SIGN TO OKAY AND

02:31:17.935 --> 02:31:18.669
THAT NUMBER WOULD BE TO CORRECT.

02:31:18.736 --> 02:31:21.639
YEAH THANK YOU I HAVE FOUR BUT

02:31:21.705 --> 02:31:22.706
YOU GUYS GO FIRST DOCTOR ROSEN

02:31:22.773 --> 02:31:23.908
GOES FOR OKAY GOOD AFTERNOON

02:31:23.974 --> 02:31:25.709
CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS.

02:31:25.776 --> 02:31:26.777
I AM INTERESTED DIRECTOR THE

02:31:26.844 --> 02:31:28.479
FERTILITY PRESERVATION PROGRAM

02:31:28.546 --> 02:31:29.780
AT UCSF.

02:31:29.847 --> 02:31:31.348
I WORK WITH PATIENTS ON A DAILY

02:31:31.415 --> 02:31:33.217
REGULAR BASIS WHO ARE FACING

02:31:33.284 --> 02:31:34.118
TREATMENT WHICH COULD SAVE THEIR

02:31:34.185 --> 02:31:35.786
LIVES THAT THE COST OF THE

02:31:35.853 --> 02:31:36.720
PARTICULARLY.

02:31:36.787 --> 02:31:37.922
OVER THE PAST FIFTEEN YEARS I'VE

02:31:37.988 --> 02:31:39.290
SEEN THOUSANDS OF WOMEN OF

02:31:39.356 --> 02:31:41.325
REPRODUCTIVE AGE DIAGNOSED WITH

02:31:41.392 --> 02:31:42.126
THE SIGNIFICANT MEDICAL

02:31:42.193 --> 02:31:42.827
CONDITION.

02:31:42.893 --> 02:31:44.028
AND THE A SIGNIFICANT

02:31:44.094 --> 02:31:45.362
REPRODUCTIVE COMPROMISE AS A

02:31:45.429 --> 02:31:47.731
RESULT OF THEIR LIFESAVING

02:31:47.798 --> 02:31:48.432
TREATMENT.

02:31:48.499 --> 02:31:49.533
WE ARE AT THIS PLACE TODAY

02:31:49.600 --> 02:31:50.835
BECAUSE OF THE INTERSECTION OF

02:31:50.901 --> 02:31:52.369
THE ADVANCES OF MEDICINE OF

02:31:52.436 --> 02:31:54.071
ONCOLOGY INFERTILITY.

02:31:54.138 --> 02:31:54.939
THE TREATMENT FOR CANCER HAS

02:31:55.005 --> 02:31:56.507
ADVANCED SO THAT IS LARGELY

02:31:56.574 --> 02:31:57.808
SUCCESSFUL.

02:31:57.875 --> 02:31:58.776
BUT THE SO QUALITY OF NOT

02:31:58.843 --> 02:32:00.778
REPRODUCING AS A RESULT OF THE

02:32:00.845 --> 02:32:02.079
TREATMENT A DEVASTATING.

02:32:02.146 --> 02:32:03.581
THE TECHNOLOGY FERTILITY

02:32:03.647 --> 02:32:05.115
PRESERVATION IS ADVANCED SO MUCH

02:32:05.182 --> 02:32:07.384
THAT IS NOW BEING USED ROUTINELY

02:32:07.451 --> 02:32:09.019
FOR WOMEN WHO WANT TO DELAY

02:32:09.086 --> 02:32:10.221
FAMILY BUILDING.

02:32:10.287 --> 02:32:11.021
CURRENTLY THE REMAINS A

02:32:11.088 --> 02:32:12.790
SIGNIFICANT OBSTACLE TO

02:32:12.857 --> 02:32:13.791
ACCOMMODATE THE URGENT NEEDS OF

02:32:13.858 --> 02:32:15.192
THESE CANCER PATIENTS DUE TO THE

02:32:15.259 --> 02:32:16.660
LACK OF CLARIFICATION OF THE

02:32:16.727 --> 02:32:17.962
EXISTING COVERAGE OF CODE IN

02:32:18.028 --> 02:32:18.996
CODE.

02:32:19.063 --> 02:32:20.698
IN WOMEN DIAGNOSED WITH CANCER

02:32:20.764 --> 02:32:21.732
PATIENTS AND PHYSICIANS MUST

02:32:21.799 --> 02:32:23.534
DECIDE IN THE COURSE OF CARE AND

02:32:23.601 --> 02:32:24.768
ACT QUICKLY.

02:32:24.835 --> 02:32:26.403
THE INSURANCE COVERAGE MUST BE

02:32:26.470 --> 02:32:27.771
CLEARLY STATED EASILY ACCESSED

02:32:27.838 --> 02:32:29.440
HOWEVER THIS IS OFTEN NOT THE

02:32:29.507 --> 02:32:30.908
CASE.

02:32:30.975 --> 02:32:32.176
THIS IS COMPLICATED BY THE FACT

02:32:32.243 --> 02:32:33.944
THAT NOT ALL SERVICES ARE LISTED

02:32:34.011 --> 02:32:35.212
IN THE EVIDENCE.

02:32:35.279 --> 02:32:36.514
OF COVERAGE BUT INFERTILITY

02:32:36.580 --> 02:32:39.483
OFTEN IS LISTED TYPICALLY AS A

02:32:39.550 --> 02:32:41.018
NON COVERED SERVICE.

02:32:41.085 --> 02:32:42.386
THE CONFUSION BETWEEN FERTILITY

02:32:42.453 --> 02:32:43.687
PRESERVATION INFERTILITY IS

02:32:43.754 --> 02:32:46.123
RAMPANT AND ADDS TO THE DELAYS

02:32:46.190 --> 02:32:49.126
IF NOT IF NOT OUTRIGHT DENIALS

02:32:49.193 --> 02:32:50.895
SIMPLY SPECIFICALLY LISTING

02:32:50.961 --> 02:32:52.563
FERTILITY PRESERVATION IS A

02:32:52.630 --> 02:32:53.597
COVERED BENEFIT WOULD LESSEN THE

02:32:53.664 --> 02:32:55.165
CONFUSION.

02:32:55.232 --> 02:32:56.600
THE CONFUSION LEADS TO DELAYS

02:32:56.667 --> 02:32:58.636
WHICH FOR MANY OF THESE WOMEN IS

02:32:58.702 --> 02:32:59.937
EQUIPMENT TO THE NILE TO THE

02:33:00.004 --> 02:33:02.039
NARROW WINDOW OF WHEN THEY CAN

02:33:02.106 --> 02:33:03.474
ACCESS THE SERVICE.

02:33:03.541 --> 02:33:04.875
IN LIGHT OF THE CANCER TREATMENT

02:33:04.942 --> 02:33:07.111
AS A RESULT FEWER WOMEN ARE ABLE

02:33:07.177 --> 02:33:09.480
TO CURRENTLY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF

02:33:09.547 --> 02:33:10.047
USING FERTILITY PRESERVATION

02:33:10.114 --> 02:33:11.749
TRADE.

02:33:11.815 --> 02:33:12.683
SO WHY IS THIS ACCESO CRITICAL.

02:33:12.750 --> 02:33:14.151
THERE IS EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST

02:33:14.218 --> 02:33:15.452
THAT ONE THIRD OF WOMEN.

02:33:15.519 --> 02:33:16.353
ARE ONE THIRD OF PATIENTS

02:33:16.420 --> 02:33:17.621
POTENTIALLY HAVE THE FERTILITY

02:33:17.688 --> 02:33:18.522
DECISIONS INFLUENCE THEIR

02:33:18.589 --> 02:33:20.257
TREATMENT DECISIONS WHEN THEY

02:33:20.324 --> 02:33:21.492
DON'T HAVE COVERAGE FOR TO LEE

02:33:21.559 --> 02:33:22.927
PRESERVATION FOR GOING

02:33:22.993 --> 02:33:24.295
RECOMMENDED TREATMENT.

02:33:24.361 --> 02:33:25.229
WE ALREADY KNOW THAT THE

02:33:25.296 --> 02:33:26.397
PATIENTS WITHOUT THE OPTION

02:33:26.463 --> 02:33:27.831
FERTILITY PRESERVATION SCORE

02:33:27.898 --> 02:33:29.533
WORSE ON MEASURES OF QUALITY OF

02:33:29.600 --> 02:33:30.734
LIFE AND SATISFACTION WITH LIFE.

02:33:30.801 --> 02:33:32.903
WE ARE SEEING THAT THE LACK OF

02:33:32.970 --> 02:33:33.771
COVERAGE COULD EVEN IMPACT THEIR

02:33:33.837 --> 02:33:36.607
CHANCE OF SURVIVING THEIR CANCER.

02:33:36.674 --> 02:33:38.576
IN CONCLUSION CLARIFICATION THE

02:33:38.642 --> 02:33:39.577
EXISTING COVERAGE FOR FERTILITY

02:33:39.643 --> 02:33:40.911
PRESERVATION WOULD PROVIDE A

02:33:40.978 --> 02:33:42.813
BETTER CARE.

02:33:42.880 --> 02:33:44.448
GIVING A PERSON BOTH THEIR LIFE.

02:33:44.515 --> 02:33:46.183
AND THEIR DREAM OF A BIOLOGIC

02:33:46.250 --> 02:33:47.151
FAMILY.

02:33:47.217 --> 02:33:49.186
THANK YOU AND I BEHALF OF UCSF

02:33:49.253 --> 02:33:50.321
THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF

02:33:50.387 --> 02:33:52.489
REPRODUCTIVE MEDICINE.

02:33:52.556 --> 02:33:56.994
MY PATIENCE AND MYSELF I ASK FOR

02:33:57.061 --> 02:34:00.097
YOUR RIVAL [inaudible]

02:34:00.164 --> 02:34:01.098
THANK YOU.

02:34:01.165 --> 02:34:02.333
HI GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU

02:34:02.399 --> 02:34:02.900
CHAIRMAN WOULD AN HONORABLE

02:34:02.967 --> 02:34:03.534
COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR ALLOWING

02:34:03.601 --> 02:34:04.568
ME TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF SENATE

02:34:04.635 --> 02:34:06.003
BILL.

02:34:06.070 --> 02:34:06.971
SIX HUNDRED MY NAME IS JOYCE

02:34:07.037 --> 02:34:08.305
REINECKE AND I'M THE EXECUTIVE

02:34:08.372 --> 02:34:10.074
DIRECTOR OF A NATIONAL NONPROFIT

02:34:10.140 --> 02:34:12.543
ORGANIZATION CALLED THE ALLIANCE

02:34:12.610 --> 02:34:14.545
FOR FERTILITY PRESERVATION.

02:34:14.612 --> 02:34:16.246
BUT I AM ALSO A CANCER SURVIVOR

02:34:16.313 --> 02:34:16.914
AND I HAD TO GO THROUGH

02:34:16.981 --> 02:34:18.649
FERTILITY PRESERVATION TO HAVE

02:34:18.716 --> 02:34:20.217
MY OWN CHILDREN.

02:34:20.284 --> 02:34:21.952
THROUGH MY WORK OVER THE PAST

02:34:22.019 --> 02:34:23.587
FIFTEEN YEARS I'VE MET HUNDREDS

02:34:23.654 --> 02:34:25.856
OF CANCER PATIENTS SURVIVORS AND

02:34:25.923 --> 02:34:27.524
FAMILY MEMBERS AND I'VE HEARD

02:34:27.591 --> 02:34:29.226
THEIR FEARS ABOUT THEIR CANCER.

02:34:29.293 --> 02:34:31.362
BUT ALSO ABOUT THEIR CHANCE OF

02:34:31.428 --> 02:34:32.563
HAVING CHILDREN.

02:34:32.630 --> 02:34:34.531
YEARS AGO OPTIONS FOR THESE

02:34:34.598 --> 02:34:36.100
PATIENTS WERE LIMITED.

02:34:36.166 --> 02:34:36.867
AND THERE REALLY WASN'T A

02:34:36.934 --> 02:34:38.235
DISCUSSION ABOUT INSURANCE

02:34:38.302 --> 02:34:39.370
COVERAGE.

02:34:39.436 --> 02:34:40.704
BUT AS YOU'VE JUST HEARD THE

02:34:40.771 --> 02:34:41.972
TECHNOLOGY HAS ADVANCED

02:34:42.039 --> 02:34:43.273
SIGNIFICANTLY AND IS NOW

02:34:43.340 --> 02:34:45.075
CONSIDERED STANDARD BY ALL OF

02:34:45.142 --> 02:34:47.378
THE RELEVANT -- CANCER AND

02:34:47.444 --> 02:34:49.046
REPRODUCTIVE SOCIETIES.

02:34:49.113 --> 02:34:50.781
INSURERS BY AND LARGE HOWEVER

02:34:50.848 --> 02:34:53.250
HAVE NOT UPDATED THEIR COVERAGES

02:34:53.317 --> 02:34:54.785
TO REFLECT THIS REALITY.

02:34:54.852 --> 02:34:56.053
THEY HAVE AVOIDED COVERING

02:34:56.120 --> 02:34:58.555
FERTILITY PRESERVATION BY

02:34:58.622 --> 02:34:59.857
CONTINUING TO LOOK AT IT AS A

02:34:59.923 --> 02:35:01.992
TYPE OF INFERTILITY TREATMENT.

02:35:02.059 --> 02:35:04.662
AND THEREFORE ELECTIVE AN

02:35:04.728 --> 02:35:05.596
EXCLUDED.

02:35:05.663 --> 02:35:07.064
BUT I WOULD PUT TO YOU THAT THE

02:35:07.131 --> 02:35:09.566
LOSS OF FERTILITY IS NOT MERELY

02:35:09.633 --> 02:35:11.235
A MEDICAL COMPLICATION.

02:35:11.301 --> 02:35:13.103
THIS AFFECTS REPRODUCTION AND

02:35:13.170 --> 02:35:14.304
EFFECTS PARENTHOOD WHICH ARE

02:35:14.371 --> 02:35:16.573
FUNDAMENTAL LIFE FUNCTIONS.

02:35:16.640 --> 02:35:19.076
AND THAT DESERVE THE HIGHEST

02:35:19.143 --> 02:35:20.310
ORDER PROTECTION.

02:35:20.377 --> 02:35:22.446
BUT AT A MINIMUM WE ASK THAT AT

02:35:22.513 --> 02:35:24.014
LEAST THESE SERVICES BE TREATED

02:35:24.081 --> 02:35:25.282
THE SAME WAY AS OTHER MEDICAL

02:35:25.349 --> 02:35:26.650
SIDE EFFECTS THAT ARE

02:35:26.717 --> 02:35:28.218
ENCOUNTERED IN CANCER TREATMENT.

02:35:28.285 --> 02:35:30.421
SUCH AS ANTI NAUSEA MEDICATIONS

02:35:30.487 --> 02:35:32.489
PROSTHETICS AND BREAST

02:35:32.556 --> 02:35:34.358
RECONSTRUCTION THESE ARE SEEN AS

02:35:34.425 --> 02:35:37.027
INTEGRAL TO CANCER CARE AND AS A

02:35:37.094 --> 02:35:38.295
RESULT THEY ARE COVERED.

02:35:38.362 --> 02:35:39.463
THANKFULLY STATES AND BODIES

02:35:39.530 --> 02:35:40.497
ACROSS THE COUNTRY HAVE

02:35:40.564 --> 02:35:42.766
INCREASINGLY ADOPTED THIS VIEW.

02:35:42.833 --> 02:35:44.568
AND IN THE LAST TWO YEARS SIX

02:35:44.635 --> 02:35:46.236
STATES AND THE VETERANS HEALTH

02:35:46.303 --> 02:35:47.938
ADMINISTRATION HAVE ENACTED THIS

02:35:48.005 --> 02:35:48.906
COVERAGE.

02:35:48.972 --> 02:35:50.607
AND THERE ADDITIONAL BILLS THAT

02:35:50.674 --> 02:35:52.176
ARE PENDING RIGHT NOW.

02:35:52.242 --> 02:35:53.110
HERE IN CALIFORNIA THE

02:35:53.177 --> 02:35:54.445
DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTHCARE

02:35:54.511 --> 02:35:56.580
HAS ALREADY RECOGNIZED INSURERS

02:35:56.647 --> 02:35:58.949
LEGAL OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE THIS

02:35:59.016 --> 02:36:00.350
COVERAGE FOR THESE PATIENTS.

02:36:00.417 --> 02:36:02.486
THIS BUTTE CAME ABOUT AFTER A

02:36:02.553 --> 02:36:04.021
DELIBERATE EFFORT THAT WE WERE

02:36:04.088 --> 02:36:06.123
INVOLVED IN TO HELP CANCER

02:36:06.190 --> 02:36:07.458
PATIENTS CHALLENGE DENIALS OF

02:36:07.524 --> 02:36:08.992
COVERAGE.

02:36:09.059 --> 02:36:10.627
THE INDEPENDENT MEDICAL REVIEWS

02:36:10.694 --> 02:36:11.962
IN ALL OF THESE CASES HAVE

02:36:12.029 --> 02:36:13.597
CONSISTENTLY FOUND THAT IN THE

02:36:13.664 --> 02:36:15.733
FACE OF POTENTIALLY STERILIZING

02:36:15.799 --> 02:36:17.101
CANCER TREATMENT.

02:36:17.167 --> 02:36:18.569
FERTILITY PRESERVATION WAS

02:36:18.635 --> 02:36:20.304
MEDICALLY NECESSARY AND SHOULD

02:36:20.370 --> 02:36:21.572
HAVE BEEN COVERED.

02:36:21.638 --> 02:36:23.707
THEY HAVE UNIFORMLY OVERTURN THE

02:36:23.774 --> 02:36:25.209
INSURERS TO NILES.

02:36:25.275 --> 02:36:26.910
THESE HAVE BEEN GREAT OUTCOMES

02:36:26.977 --> 02:36:28.178
FOR THE INDIVIDUAL PATIENTS WHO

02:36:28.245 --> 02:36:29.813
WERE INVOLVED BUT THIS IS NOT A

02:36:29.880 --> 02:36:32.015
VIABLE PATH FOR COVERAGE FOR THE

02:36:32.082 --> 02:36:33.617
MAJORITY OF PATIENTS.

02:36:33.684 --> 02:36:35.085
THEY'RE IN THE MIDST OF A LIFE

02:36:35.152 --> 02:36:37.354
ALTERING MEDICAL CRISIS A

02:36:37.421 --> 02:36:39.056
DIAGNOSIS OF CANCER.

02:36:39.123 --> 02:36:40.224
AND THEY CANNOT REASONABLY BE

02:36:40.290 --> 02:36:42.126
EXPECTED TO UNDERTAKE A TIME

02:36:42.192 --> 02:36:44.128
CONSUMING FINANCIALLY RISKY

02:36:44.194 --> 02:36:45.662
APPEAL PROCESS.

02:36:45.729 --> 02:36:47.064
ESPECIALLY FOR COVERAGE THAT THE

OVER -- OVER IN THE SENATE --

02:43:50.487 --> 02:43:52.189
BUT IT SEEMED LIKE THAT -- THE

02:43:52.255 --> 02:43:53.490
QUESTION ABOUT THIS SORT OF

02:43:53.557 --> 02:43:57.027
RETRO ACTIVE VERSUS PERSPECTIVE --

02:43:57.093 --> 02:43:58.295
I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING I

02:43:58.361 --> 02:44:00.163
WOULD SUPPORT ON A PROSPECTIVE

02:44:00.230 --> 02:44:01.965
BASIS BUT I AM CONCERNED ABOUT --

02:44:02.032 --> 02:44:04.734
THIS IDEA OF OF THAT LANGUAGE

02:44:04.801 --> 02:44:07.003
ABOUT -- DEVELOPING RETROACTIVE

02:44:07.070 --> 02:44:10.440
IN THE MAYBE EVEN SOME -- LEGAL

02:44:10.507 --> 02:44:12.242
LIABILITY THAT MIGHT THAT BE

02:44:12.309 --> 02:44:13.977
DRAWN FROM NEXT SO CAN YOU DRESS

02:44:14.044 --> 02:44:14.611
THEM.

02:44:14.678 --> 02:44:15.879
YEAH THE SECOND PART I THINK IS

02:44:15.946 --> 02:44:16.513
THE EASIEST PART I DON'T THINK

02:44:16.580 --> 02:44:19.482
THERE'S LEGAL LIABILITY -- YOU

02:44:19.549 --> 02:44:21.851
KNOW OUR OUR ANALYSIS OUR POINT

02:44:21.918 --> 02:44:26.256
IS PRECISELY BECAUSE THAT PEACE

02:44:26.323 --> 02:44:27.457
IS BEING.

02:44:27.524 --> 02:44:29.259
DISCUSSED IS WHY WE NEED TO MAKE

02:44:29.326 --> 02:44:32.495
IT CLEAR OF WHAT THE CURRENT LAW --

02:44:32.562 --> 02:44:34.030
IS SAYING AND WHY WERE RE

02:44:34.097 --> 02:44:35.966
STATING THAT CURRENT LAW.

02:44:36.032 --> 02:44:37.634
THE OTHER PIECE WHICH IS NOT FOR

02:44:37.701 --> 02:44:38.268
YOUR QUESTION BUT I DO WANT TO

02:44:38.335 --> 02:44:41.037
ADDRESS IN.

02:44:41.104 --> 02:44:41.671
TWO THOUSAND NINE I BROUGHT ALL

02:44:41.738 --> 02:44:43.306
THE HEALTH PLANS INTO MY OFFICE

02:44:43.373 --> 02:44:43.940
AND I SAID I DON'T WANT TO DO A

02:44:44.007 --> 02:44:45.675
BILL.

02:44:45.742 --> 02:44:47.310
JUST SOLVE THIS PROBLEM.

02:44:47.377 --> 02:44:49.546
AND I SAID TAKE A YEAR.

02:44:49.613 --> 02:44:51.748
YOU KNOW TO FIND YOUR BENEFIT.

02:44:51.815 --> 02:44:53.583
YOU KNOW THIS IS WHEN THE

02:44:53.650 --> 02:44:55.151
ORIGINAL MANDATES WERE CREATED.

02:44:55.218 --> 02:44:56.353
THE ADVANCES IN FERTILITY

02:44:56.419 --> 02:44:58.121
PRESERVATION DIDN'T EXIST AND I

02:44:58.188 --> 02:44:59.689
SAID NOW THAT THEY'RE THERE GO

02:44:59.756 --> 02:45:00.757
AHEAD AND DO IT.

02:45:00.824 --> 02:45:03.126
SO IT WAS WITH RELUCTANCE THAT I

02:45:03.193 --> 02:45:05.128
WENT INTO THIS BUT NOW THAT IT'S

02:45:05.195 --> 02:45:06.529
BEEN A DECADE LATER.

02:45:06.596 --> 02:45:08.798
EACH STEP OF THE WAY WE REALLY

02:45:08.865 --> 02:45:10.467
HAVEN'T BEEN GETTING THE SUPPORT

02:45:10.533 --> 02:45:11.468
THAT I THOUGHT.

02:45:11.534 --> 02:45:13.470
PEOPLE WOULD EMBRACE GIVEN THE

02:45:13.536 --> 02:45:15.939
ADVANCES OF OF TECHNOLOGY AND

02:45:16.006 --> 02:45:17.374
WHERE FERTILITY PRESERVATION IS

02:45:17.440 --> 02:45:18.908
TODAY THE OTHER PART OF THE

02:45:18.975 --> 02:45:20.310
RETROACTIVITY THE NUMBER OF

02:45:20.377 --> 02:45:21.578
PEOPLE THAT WOULD ACTUALLY BE

02:45:21.645 --> 02:45:22.612
AFFECTED.

02:45:22.679 --> 02:45:24.281
WOULD BE A VERY VERY SMALL

02:45:24.347 --> 02:45:26.082
AMOUNT WE KNOW THAT NUMBER

02:45:26.149 --> 02:45:28.351
WHAT'S THAT THE NUMBER YOU GUYS

02:45:28.418 --> 02:45:30.387
WANT.

02:45:30.453 --> 02:45:34.758
TO WHO WANTS TO JUMP IN ON SORRY

02:45:34.824 --> 02:45:35.792
I'VE YOU MEAN THE NUMBER PER

02:45:35.859 --> 02:45:37.260
YEAR THAT WOULD BE DIAGNOSED IN

02:45:37.327 --> 02:45:38.295
NO NO THOSE THING BECAUSE BY NOW

02:45:38.361 --> 02:45:39.929
IT WOULD BE IF IT'S RETROACTIVE

02:45:39.996 --> 02:45:41.364
THOSE THAT WOULD WOULD HAVE

02:45:41.431 --> 02:45:43.233
WOULD BE USING THIS -- THAT WAS

02:45:43.300 --> 02:45:45.535
RETRACTED FROM THEIR DIAGNOSIS

02:45:45.602 --> 02:45:48.038
NOT RETROACTIVE FROM A CALENDAR

02:45:48.104 --> 02:45:50.206
PROJECT RIGHT RIGHT -- BASED ON

02:45:50.273 --> 02:45:51.508
CONVERSATIONS THAT WE WERE PART

02:45:51.574 --> 02:45:53.977
OF LAST WEEK WITH THE D. MHC I

02:45:54.044 --> 02:45:55.412
KNOW THAT THEY SAID THAT THERE

02:45:55.478 --> 02:45:56.946
ARE EXISTING ROLES WITHIN THE

02:45:57.013 --> 02:45:59.015
PLANS ABOUT -- YOU KNOW KIND OF

02:45:59.082 --> 02:46:00.750
STATUTES OF LIMITATIONS AS TO

02:46:00.817 --> 02:46:01.818
WHEN SOMEONECAN BRING A CLAIM

02:46:01.885 --> 02:46:03.620
AND THAT'S ALREADY YOU'RE NOT

02:46:03.687 --> 02:46:06.089
CHANGING THOSE PIECES WE'RE JUST

02:46:06.156 --> 02:46:07.023
MAKING SURE THAT THOSE PEOPLE

02:46:07.090 --> 02:46:07.724
WHO.

02:46:07.791 --> 02:46:10.327
ARE WARRANTED COVERAGE GET IT IF

02:46:10.393 --> 02:46:12.062
IT WAS MESSED WITHIN.

02:46:12.128 --> 02:46:13.863
THAT TIME FRAME NOT GOING BACK

02:46:13.930 --> 02:46:15.832
FIVE YEARS AND SAYING YOU WERE

02:46:15.899 --> 02:46:16.800
SHOULD HAVE HAD THIS THAT'S NOT

02:46:16.866 --> 02:46:17.867
WHAT THIS IS TIME IT'S WITHIN

02:46:17.934 --> 02:46:19.469
THE TIME FRAME OF THEIR

02:46:19.536 --> 02:46:20.403
DIAGNOSIS.

02:46:20.470 --> 02:46:23.940
MAKING SURE THAT IT IT'S COVERED

02:46:24.007 --> 02:46:25.175
AND CLARIFYING THE LAW TO DO

02:46:25.241 --> 02:46:26.710
THAT.

02:46:26.776 --> 02:46:28.345
SO IT MIGHT HAVE WITH THE FACT

02:46:28.411 --> 02:46:29.112
THAT THE OPPOSITION CAN ONE AND

02:46:29.179 --> 02:46:30.647
TALK ABOUT THAT IN REGARDS TO

02:46:30.714 --> 02:46:34.117
THE SHE WANTS TO JUMP IN IF I'M

02:46:34.184 --> 02:46:35.385
SURE THAT GARY -- FROM OUR

02:46:35.452 --> 02:46:36.486
CONVERSATION WITH THE DEPARTMENT

02:46:36.553 --> 02:46:37.153
OF MANAGED HEALTH CARE YOU KNOW

02:46:37.220 --> 02:46:38.655
STATING THAT SOMETHING IS

02:46:38.722 --> 02:46:40.156
RETROACTIVE IS SIMPLY.

02:46:40.223 --> 02:46:42.359
AN ACCURATE CHARACTERIZATION.

02:46:42.425 --> 02:46:44.194
THIS BILL SEEKS TO STATE THAT

02:46:44.260 --> 02:46:46.296
IT'S SIMPLY DECLARATORY EXISTING

02:46:46.363 --> 02:46:47.797
LAW THEREFORE THERE CAN BE NO

02:46:47.864 --> 02:46:49.766
RETROACTIVITY LEGALLY SPEAKING

02:46:49.833 --> 02:46:51.534
AND MY CALL YOUR CAN SPEAK A

02:46:51.601 --> 02:46:53.136
LITTLE BIT MORE BUT BUT BUT IF I

02:46:53.203 --> 02:46:54.537
CAN IF IT'S DECLARATORY OF

02:46:54.604 --> 02:46:55.705
EXISTING LAW THEN WHAT WHAT'S

02:46:55.772 --> 02:46:59.442
THE PURPOSE OF OF OF THE BILL.

02:46:59.509 --> 02:47:00.410
BECAUSE THEY'RE DENYING THAT WE

02:47:00.477 --> 02:47:01.311
COVERAGE UNDER EXISTING LAW

02:47:01.378 --> 02:47:03.246
THERE'S FORCING THESE APPEALS

02:47:03.313 --> 02:47:09.119
AND EVERY APPEAL HAS BEEN

02:47:09.185 --> 02:47:11.187
OVERTURNED.

02:47:11.254 --> 02:47:12.188
THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT.

02:47:12.255 --> 02:47:12.689
THEY'RE SAYING IN THEIR

02:47:12.756 --> 02:47:13.289
ARGUMENTS THAT THE LAW IS IN

02:47:13.356 --> 02:47:13.923
CLEAR.

02:47:13.990 --> 02:47:14.524
AND WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE SURE

02:47:14.591 --> 02:47:16.426
THAT THE LAW IS CLEAR EVERYONE

02:47:16.493 --> 02:47:16.926
OF THE APPEALS HAS BEEN

02:47:16.993 --> 02:47:18.528
OVERTURNED BUT WHAT I THINK I

02:47:18.595 --> 02:47:19.629
HEARD IS THEY'RE SAYING THAT THE

02:47:19.696 --> 02:47:21.197
EXISTING LAW DOESN'T REQUIRE --

02:47:21.264 --> 02:47:23.600
THIS AND SO IF IT YEAH GOD SO IF

02:47:23.666 --> 02:47:24.534
I MAY UM THE DEPARTMENT OF

02:47:24.601 --> 02:47:25.769
MANAGED HEALTHCARE ISSUED A

02:47:25.835 --> 02:47:27.404

OUTPATIENT SURGICAL PROCEDURES

02:47:36.179 --> 02:47:37.547
AND PREVENTATIVE HEALTHCARE.

02:47:37.614 --> 02:47:39.516
SERVICES ALL OF WHICH ARE

02:47:39.582 --> 02:47:41.251

THIRTEEN FORTY FIVE MORE OVER IF

02:47:46.456 --> 02:47:49.058
WE LOOK AT THE TO BURKE ANALYSIS --

02:47:49.125 --> 02:47:50.026
YOU KNOW SPEAKING TO THE FACT

02:47:50.093 --> 02:47:51.661
THAT IT EXCEEDS THE ESSENTIAL

HEALTH BENEFITS CLEAN.

02:47:52.962 --> 02:47:54.597
STATES SB SIX HUNDRED IS

02:47:54.664 --> 02:47:56.766
UNLIKELY TO EXCEED THE ESSENTIAL

02:47:56.833 --> 02:47:58.401
HEALTH BENEFITS DIEM ACTUALLY

02:47:58.468 --> 02:47:59.502
CONFIRMED TO TO BURKE THAT UNDER

MEDICALLY NECESSARY FOR THE AND

REALLY ISN'T IN OPPOSITION TO

02:48:17.587 --> 02:48:18.154
DRESS THAT.

02:48:18.221 --> 02:48:21.658
YET SO -- WELL SEVERAL THINGS

02:48:21.724 --> 02:48:23.660
WERE -- INCLUDED AS A PART THAT

02:48:23.726 --> 02:48:24.794
WE WE WHICH SPECIFIC COMPONENT

02:48:24.861 --> 02:48:26.029
WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO ADDRESS

02:48:26.095 --> 02:48:27.597
WHAT IS IT THAT YOU THAT'S THE

02:48:27.664 --> 02:48:28.565
DESPITE THIS BUT I MEAN.

02:48:28.631 --> 02:48:30.300
WHAT WHAT SHE HAD JUST REFERRED

02:48:30.366 --> 02:48:31.968
TO HAVE THIS IDEA FOR IF IT WERE

02:48:32.035 --> 02:48:34.471
SAYING THAT IT'S THAT IF IT IS

02:48:34.537 --> 02:48:35.505
THE EXISTING LAW?

02:48:35.572 --> 02:48:36.873
YEAH NO THE EGGS EXISTING LAW

02:48:36.940 --> 02:48:38.475
DOES NOT REQUIRE FERTILITY

02:48:38.541 --> 02:48:44.747
PRESERVATION TO BE COVERED -- I

02:48:44.814 --> 02:48:45.648
WE THINK IT'S WE THINK IT'S

02:48:45.715 --> 02:48:47.884
PRETTY QUICK CLEAR -- THE

02:48:47.951 --> 02:48:48.885
LEGISLATURE IN THE

02:48:48.952 --> 02:48:49.719
ADMINISTRATION PICKED AN

02:48:49.786 --> 02:48:50.386
ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS

02:48:50.453 --> 02:48:51.020
PACKAGE THEY PICKED.

02:48:51.087 --> 02:48:53.056
AN EXISTING PRODUCT THATWAS ON

02:48:53.122 --> 02:48:54.891
THE MARKET TO SERVE AS THE

02:48:54.958 --> 02:48:56.326
ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS FOR

02:48:56.392 --> 02:48:58.228
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- THAT

02:48:58.294 --> 02:49:02.098
PRODUCT DID NOT -- INCLUDE

02:49:02.165 --> 02:49:04.367
COVERAGE.

02:49:04.434 --> 02:49:05.168
FOR FERTILITY PRESERVATION AND

02:49:05.235 --> 02:49:08.338
THIS CONCEPT THAT THIS IS A

02:49:08.404 --> 02:49:10.306
BASIC HEALTH CARE SERVICE -- WE

02:49:10.373 --> 02:49:12.675
THINK -- IS A FAULTY ARGUMENT

02:49:12.742 --> 02:49:13.676
THE LEGISLATURE HAS THE

02:49:13.743 --> 02:49:16.079
EXCLUSIVE AUTHORITY TO DEFINE.

02:49:16.145 --> 02:49:17.847
THE BENEFITS AND THE SERVICES

02:49:17.914 --> 02:49:19.048
THAT ARE TO BE COVERED BY HEALTH

02:49:19.115 --> 02:49:21.351
PLANS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

02:49:21.417 --> 02:49:23.286
WE BELIEVE THE DEPARTMENT LACKS

02:49:23.353 --> 02:49:25.622
THE POWER TO UNILATERALLY EXPAND

02:49:25.688 --> 02:49:27.490
THOSE BENEFITS AND SERVICES --

02:49:27.557 --> 02:49:29.359
THE DECISION TO WHAT CONSTITUTES

02:49:29.425 --> 02:49:31.394
A A A SERVICE IS A POLICY

02:49:31.461 --> 02:49:32.929
DECISION THAT IN OUR VIEW IS

02:49:32.996 --> 02:49:33.696
SOLELY IN THE HANDS OF THE

02:49:33.763 --> 02:49:34.697
LEGISLATURE SO I THINK THAT'S

02:49:34.764 --> 02:49:35.999
WHAT THIS BILL IS TRYING TO DO

02:49:36.065 --> 02:49:37.000
AND SO I'M I'M HAVING A

02:49:37.066 --> 02:49:38.468
DIFFICULT TIME UNDERSTANDING

02:49:38.535 --> 02:49:40.003
BETWEEN THE TWO WONDERING IF.

02:49:40.069 --> 02:49:42.138
IF THE LEADS SO IN REGARDS TO TO

02:49:42.205 --> 02:49:43.773
SAYING THAT THAT THE LAW ALREADY

02:49:43.840 --> 02:49:45.441
EXISTED THIS SHOULD BE A COVERED

02:49:45.508 --> 02:49:46.576
BENEFIT.

02:49:46.643 --> 02:49:48.411
THE DA POSITION IS SAYING NO THE

02:49:48.478 --> 02:49:51.481
BILL SAYING YES IT IS -- SO IS

02:49:51.548 --> 02:49:53.516
THE LEGISLATURE THAT THE PROPER

02:49:53.583 --> 02:49:54.651
PLACE TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THAT

02:49:54.717 --> 02:49:56.152
DECISION OR THE COURTS THE

02:49:56.219 --> 02:49:57.520
PROPER PLACE TO BE TO BE ABLE TO

02:49:57.587 --> 02:49:58.621
MAKE THAT DECISION BECAUSE IF IN

02:49:58.688 --> 02:50:00.156
THE PAST YOU GUYS OF SAID NO

02:50:00.223 --> 02:50:01.491
IT'S NOT A COVERED BENEFIT

02:50:01.558 --> 02:50:02.058
THERE'S A NO ACTUALLY IS A

02:50:02.125 --> 02:50:02.325
COVERED.

02:50:02.392 --> 02:50:04.360
BENEFIT THAT SEEMS TO BE THE

02:50:04.427 --> 02:50:05.762
CRUX OF THE PART OF THE PROBLEM.

02:50:05.828 --> 02:50:07.564
RIGHT SO IF WE WE'VE OFFERED

02:50:07.630 --> 02:50:09.132
AMENDMENTS WE ARE WILLING TO

02:50:09.198 --> 02:50:12.702
ENTER INTO A DISCUSSION WITH THE

02:50:12.769 --> 02:50:15.138
AUTHOR IN THE SPONSOR. TO WORK

02:50:15.204 --> 02:50:15.572
ON THIS BILL IF THE

02:50:15.638 --> 02:50:17.407
RETROACTIVITYPEACE IS REMOVED

02:50:17.473 --> 02:50:18.841
SO THAT WE CAN PROSPECTIVELY

02:50:18.908 --> 02:50:21.044
ESTABLISH COVERAGE FOR FERTILITY

02:50:21.110 --> 02:50:22.645
PRESERVATION SERVICES SO IF I

02:50:22.712 --> 02:50:25.114
CAN JUST FOR SECOND THINKING

02:50:25.181 --> 02:50:26.849
NOUN SO THAT STATE.

02:50:26.916 --> 02:50:28.952
SENATOR PORTANTINO FOUR YEARS

02:50:29.018 --> 02:50:29.552
AGO WHEN DID YOU CITIES FIRST

02:50:29.619 --> 02:50:33.222

AND TEN IN CENTER PORTANTINO BUT

02:50:35.091 --> 02:50:36.292
THE TIME ASSEMBLY MEMBER

02:50:36.359 --> 02:50:38.027
PORTANTINO -- I BELIEVE THAT

02:50:38.094 --> 02:50:41.564
THIS WAS -- SOMETHING THAT WAS

02:50:41.631 --> 02:50:46.235
COVERED AND THAT -- AND SO.

02:50:46.302 --> 02:50:47.270
AT WHAT POINT DO WE DECIDED THIS

02:50:47.337 --> 02:50:48.237
IS A COVERED BENEFIT ONE IT

02:50:48.304 --> 02:50:49.472
SOUNDS LIKE PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT

02:50:49.539 --> 02:50:50.673
THIS WAS A COVER BENEFIT NOT NOW

02:50:50.740 --> 02:50:51.174
WE'RE SAYING IT'S NOT.

02:50:51.240 --> 02:50:52.408
THERE'S GOT A BILL TO SAY NO IT

02:50:52.475 --> 02:50:54.410
WAS A COVERED BENEFIT HAS BEEN A

02:50:54.477 --> 02:50:57.947
COVER BENEFIT ALL ALONG -- OKAY

02:50:58.014 --> 02:50:59.549
SO.

02:50:59.616 --> 02:51:01.651
WHAT WHY NOT SAY SO SO WHY NOT

SAID TODAY THAT IT IS AND --

02:51:03.620 --> 02:51:04.354
WHAT WE?

02:51:04.420 --> 02:51:06.022
SO WHAT WHAT WHERE YOU OPPOSED

02:51:06.089 --> 02:51:07.323
TO THE THE IF THE IF THE

02:51:07.390 --> 02:51:08.625
LEGISLATURE CAN'T DECIDE IS A

02:51:08.691 --> 02:51:09.826
COVERED BENEFIT ANIMAL SUPPORT

02:51:09.892 --> 02:51:11.728
AMONGST THIS COMMITTEE AND THIS

02:51:11.794 --> 02:51:13.096
HOUSE -- BUT TO BE ABLE TO SAY

02:51:13.162 --> 02:51:14.263
THAT IT IS A COVERED BENEFIT ONE

02:51:14.330 --> 02:51:15.732
WITH THAT DATE START WHEN WOULD

AMENDMENTS.

02:51:22.438 --> 02:51:23.773
AND I'LL HAVE TO BREAK THOSE OUT.

02:51:23.840 --> 02:51:25.441
IN ORDER TO GET THE EXACT DATE

02:51:25.508 --> 02:51:27.577
BUT TYPICALLY IT WOULD BE --

02:51:27.644 --> 02:51:29.479
UPON RENEWAL THE NEXT POLICY OR

02:51:29.545 --> 02:51:31.814

AFTER THAT.

02:51:42.625 --> 02:51:45.762
IF I MAY THROUGH THE CHAIR.

02:51:45.828 --> 02:51:46.529
YEAH YOU HAVE TO TELL ON THE

HEAD I MEAN WE'RE HERE BECAUSE

02:51:49.265 --> 02:51:50.900
WE'RE SQUABBLING ABOUT EXISTING

02:51:50.967 --> 02:51:51.067
LAW.

02:51:51.134 --> 02:51:53.803
AND THAT'S WHY WE NEED THIS BILL

02:51:53.870 --> 02:51:55.371
AND THE POINT THAT THE A

02:51:55.438 --> 02:51:57.573
LEGISLATURE'S APPROPRIATE PLACE

02:51:57.640 --> 02:51:59.042
TO DRAW THE LINE.

02:51:59.108 --> 02:52:00.109
I'M ASKING.

02:52:00.176 --> 02:52:01.144
THE ASSEMBLY HEALTH COMMITTEE TO

02:52:01.210 --> 02:52:03.079
HELP ME DRAW THE LINE AS THE

02:52:03.146 --> 02:52:04.280
LEGISLATURE.

02:52:06.382 --> 02:52:07.984
WANT TO GO BACK IN TIME BECAUSE

02:52:08.051 --> 02:52:09.619
IT OPENS OUR FIRST OF ALL IT'S

02:52:09.686 --> 02:52:10.820
WRONG ON THE LAW.

02:52:10.887 --> 02:52:12.255
IN NUMBER TWO WOULD EXPOSE OUR

02:52:12.321 --> 02:52:15.358
PLAN.

02:52:15.425 --> 02:52:16.859
TO PLANS.

02:52:16.926 --> 02:52:17.660
TO UNKNOWN IN UNTOLD LIABILITIES

02:52:17.727 --> 02:52:18.594
FOR THOSE WHO FEEL LIKE IT WAS

02:52:18.661 --> 02:52:20.163
EXISTING LAW AND NOW WE HAVE A

02:52:20.229 --> 02:52:21.798
LAW DECLARING THAT ITS EXISTING

02:52:21.864 --> 02:52:24.567
LAW WHEN IT'S NOT -- AND SO

02:52:24.634 --> 02:52:25.935
THAT'S AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT

02:52:26.002 --> 02:52:27.003
THE LANGUAGE SAYS IT SAYS THAT

02:52:27.070 --> 02:52:29.338
THIS BILL DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A

02:52:29.405 --> 02:52:30.473
CHANGE ALONG.

02:52:30.540 --> 02:52:31.808
THEN WHY HAVE THE BILL.

02:52:31.874 --> 02:52:34.043
BUT BUT IF IT ISN'T AS IF IT IS

02:52:34.110 --> 02:52:35.211
AN EXISTING LAW.

02:52:35.278 --> 02:52:36.579
THEN YOU COULD GO TO THE COURT

02:52:36.646 --> 02:52:38.214
INSTANT THE COURT COULD SAY NO

02:52:38.281 --> 02:52:39.549
IT WASN'T EXISTING LAW.

02:52:39.615 --> 02:52:41.584
RIGHT.

02:52:41.651 --> 02:52:42.919
SURE THAT'S THAT'S A POSSIBILITY

02:52:42.985 --> 02:52:44.921
SO JUST BY SAYING TODAY THAT ITS

02:52:44.987 --> 02:52:45.922
EXISTING LOT WITH THAT WELL WHY

02:52:45.988 --> 02:52:48.091
WOULD I MEAN WE WE WE WANT TO

02:52:48.157 --> 02:52:49.959
TRY WILL [inaudible]

02:52:50.026 --> 02:52:51.427
YEAH.

02:52:51.494 --> 02:52:52.795
IF I MAYES.

02:52:52.862 --> 02:52:54.731
YEAH ONE VERY IMPORTANT ASPECT

02:52:54.797 --> 02:52:57.633
I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THIS BY

02:52:57.700 --> 02:52:58.201
THE WAY IT'S HARD NOT YOU'RE

02:52:58.267 --> 02:52:58.935
DOING YEAH.

02:52:59.001 --> 02:52:59.936
USING ONE VERY IMPORTANT ASPECT

02:53:00.002 --> 02:53:01.838
OF THAT DECLARATION THAT IT IS

02:53:01.904 --> 02:53:04.607
EXISTING LAW IS MEANT TO ADDRESS

02:53:04.674 --> 02:53:06.843
THESE -- BAIT AND STATUTORY

02:53:06.909 --> 02:53:09.545
TIMELINES WHERE BY -- ENROLLEES

02:53:09.612 --> 02:53:10.680
HAVE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME TO

02:53:10.747 --> 02:53:12.415

02:53:17.487 --> 02:53:17.720
HEALTHCARE.

02:53:17.787 --> 02:53:19.555
SO BY DECLARING THAT THIS IS

02:53:19.622 --> 02:53:22.625
EXISTING LAW -- WERE SAYING THAT

02:53:22.692 --> 02:53:24.193
THOSE TIME LINES HAVE ALREADY

THIS APPEARS IF YOU DON'T SAY

02:53:34.437 --> 02:53:35.838
THAT THIS IS EXISTING LAW AND

02:53:35.905 --> 02:53:36.973
THE IMPLICATION IS THAT YOU WERE

02:53:37.039 --> 02:53:38.941
CHANGING THE LAW WHEREBY YOU

02:53:39.008 --> 02:53:41.077

02:53:56.626 --> 02:53:58.761
MISS BURKE.

02:53:58.828 --> 02:54:00.997
SO I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE I'M

JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE I

02:54:12.975 --> 02:54:13.209
UNDERSTAND.

02:54:13.276 --> 02:54:15.244
SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT WE'RE HERE

02:54:15.311 --> 02:54:16.312
BECAUSE THERE'S NO DISAGREEMENT

02:54:16.379 --> 02:54:17.847
ABOUT WHAT EXISTING LAWS BUT THE

02:54:17.914 --> 02:54:18.414
COURTS HAS UP HOLDING YOUR

02:54:18.481 --> 02:54:20.116
INTERPRETATION OF WHAT THE LAW

02:54:20.183 --> 02:54:24.086
IS. NINE I I'M ASKING SENATOR NO

02:54:24.153 --> 02:54:25.755
IT HASN'T GONE IT HAS TO BE AN

02:54:25.822 --> 02:54:27.790
EDUCATED IN THE COURTS SO WHY DO

02:54:27.857 --> 02:54:28.591
YOU ENVISION AS WE USED TO DO.

02:54:28.658 --> 02:54:29.859
IT OKAY IS A CEASE AND DESIST

02:54:29.926 --> 02:54:31.594
ORDER ISSUED BY THE DEMON SHE TO

02:54:31.661 --> 02:54:32.995
A SPECIFIC HEALTH.

02:54:33.062 --> 02:54:34.564
HM AC SAYS THAT YES YOUR

02:54:34.630 --> 02:54:36.465
INTERPRETATION OF THE LAW IT'S

02:54:36.532 --> 02:54:37.767
CORRECT RIGHT THERE

02:54:37.834 --> 02:54:38.935
INTERPRETATION OF THE LAW THAT

02:54:39.001 --> 02:54:40.203
WERE ADELINE IT'S THEIR

02:54:40.269 --> 02:54:40.770
INTERPRETATION A LOT OKAY.

02:54:40.837 --> 02:54:41.437
SO NOW MY QUESTION IS BECAUSE WE

02:54:41.504 --> 02:54:42.338
TALKED ABOUT CLEAN SO IT'S FROM

02:54:42.405 --> 02:54:43.940
THE TIME SO I'M TRYING TO GO

02:54:44.006 --> 02:54:45.508
BACK TO THE RETROACTIVITY SO.

02:54:45.575 --> 02:54:47.276
FROM THE TIME THERE'S A

02:54:47.343 --> 02:54:49.579
DIAGNOSIS HOW LONG DOES SOMEONE

02:54:49.645 --> 02:54:59.689
HAVE TO DO THEIR PRESERVATION.

02:54:59.755 --> 02:55:01.891
OUT OF THE IT IN GENERAL IT

02:55:01.958 --> 02:55:02.959
DEPENDS IT'S A GOOD QUESTION BUT

02:55:03.025 --> 02:55:04.427
I WOULD SAY ROUGHLY THEY HAVE

02:55:04.493 --> 02:55:04.627
ABOUT.

02:55:04.694 --> 02:55:05.428
MEN LET'S SAY LESS THAN A WEEK

02:55:05.494 --> 02:55:07.496
WOULD BE VERY CONSERVATIVE -- TO

02:55:07.563 --> 02:55:08.564
ACTUALLY MAKE THE DECISION.

02:55:08.631 --> 02:55:10.666
BECAUSE THE CANCER TREATMENT IS.

02:55:10.733 --> 02:55:12.001
OF THE IMMEDIATE NATURE.

02:55:12.068 --> 02:55:14.303
SO IN THAT TREATMENT IN GENERAL

02:55:14.370 --> 02:55:17.073
TAKES A COUPLE WEEKS SO THE

02:55:17.139 --> 02:55:18.975
SOONER THEY START.

02:55:19.041 --> 02:55:20.376
THEN THE LAST DELAYS THERE ARE

02:55:20.443 --> 02:55:21.677
IN THEIR TREATMENT.

02:55:21.744 --> 02:55:22.812
BECAUSE THE DELAYS COULD

02:55:22.879 --> 02:55:24.747
POTENTIALLY CAUSE OTHER PETS FOR

02:55:24.814 --> 02:55:25.848
COMPROMISE RIGHT SO IT'S AN

02:55:25.915 --> 02:55:27.016
IMMEDIATE DECISION RIGHT AND SO

02:55:27.083 --> 02:55:28.150
WHEN YOU WERE CONCERNED ABOUT

02:55:28.217 --> 02:55:29.886
RETROACTIVITY THE THE INSURANCE

02:55:29.952 --> 02:55:31.287
PLANS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT BEING

02:55:31.354 --> 02:55:32.822
SUED BECAUSE PEOPLE HAVEN'T HAD

02:55:32.889 --> 02:55:34.457
THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO IT I WANT

02:55:34.523 --> 02:55:35.524
TO UNDERSTAND.

02:55:35.591 --> 02:55:37.894
THE THAT'S ONE OF THE CONCERNS --

02:55:37.960 --> 02:55:39.228
AND AND AND THAT'S ACOSTA CAN'T

02:55:39.295 --> 02:55:41.230
BE QUANTIFIED.

02:55:41.297 --> 02:55:43.766
PLANS DID NOT BUILD THIS INTO

02:55:43.833 --> 02:55:45.234
THEIR RATES.

02:55:45.301 --> 02:55:46.836
SO -- BECAUSE IT'S NOT A COVERED

02:55:46.903 --> 02:55:47.904
SERVICE AND NOT ONLY IS IT NOT A

02:55:47.970 --> 02:55:50.206
COVERED SERVICE -- IT WAS -- IT

02:55:50.273 --> 02:55:51.173
WAS IT WAS APPROVED AS AN ON

02:55:51.240 --> 02:55:53.409
COVERED SERVICE BY THE REGULATOR

02:55:53.476 --> 02:55:55.444
SO WE WILL.

02:55:55.511 --> 02:55:56.746
WE ARE TOLD WAS OKAY NOT TO

02:55:56.812 --> 02:55:57.213
COVER.

02:55:57.280 --> 02:55:58.948
TWO THOUSAND TWELVE THAT THE AND

02:55:59.015 --> 02:56:01.651
EVERY APPEAL HAS BEEN GRANTED

02:56:01.717 --> 02:56:03.085
RIGHT SO THE I MEAN AND NOT SO

02:56:03.152 --> 02:56:04.220
SO EVERY SO EVERY DECISION IS

02:56:04.287 --> 02:56:05.721
KIND OF CODIFIED THAT THIS IS

02:56:05.788 --> 02:56:07.056
PROBABLY IS.

02:56:07.123 --> 02:56:08.591
IN THEIR INTERPRETATION YEAH

02:56:08.658 --> 02:56:09.825
KEEPING YOUR EYES IN YOUR THEIR

02:56:09.892 --> 02:56:12.328
INTERPRETATION THAT THIS IS WHAT

02:56:12.395 --> 02:56:15.431
THE LAW MEANT -- AND SO WHAT AT

02:56:15.498 --> 02:56:17.366
WHAT LEVEL LIKE SENATOR DO YOU

02:56:17.433 --> 02:56:20.469
THINK WHEN THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT

02:56:20.536 --> 02:56:22.738
AT A LAWSUIT WHAT LEVELS ARE WE

02:56:22.805 --> 02:56:24.073
TALKING ABOUT AND FOR HOW LONG

02:56:24.140 --> 02:56:26.042
IS THIS ALL THE WAY BACK FROM

02:56:26.108 --> 02:56:26.609
TWO THOUSAND TWELVE IN YOUR

02:56:26.676 --> 02:56:28.377
ESTIMATION THAT THEY WOULD.

02:56:28.444 --> 02:56:29.412
PEOPLE WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT.

02:56:29.478 --> 02:56:30.613
TO NO BECAUSE THAT'S NOT THE

02:56:30.680 --> 02:56:32.014
TYPE OF RETROACTIVITY WE'RE

02:56:32.081 --> 02:56:33.115
TALKING ABOUT.

02:56:33.182 --> 02:56:34.517
THE RETROACTIVITY OF SERVICE

02:56:34.583 --> 02:56:35.918
WE'RE NOT OPENING UP THE

02:56:35.985 --> 02:56:37.620
RETROACTIVITY FOR LIABILITY OKAY

02:56:37.687 --> 02:56:39.655
SO THAT THAT'S THAT THAT'S THE

02:56:39.722 --> 02:56:41.090
KEY TO AND THAT WE THINK THE

02:56:41.157 --> 02:56:42.792
LIABILITY ISSUE REALLY JUST A

02:56:42.858 --> 02:56:45.194
RED HERRING. TO FIND SOMETHING

02:56:45.261 --> 02:56:47.663

02:57:44.620 --> 02:57:45.588
ONGOING DISCUSSION I MEAN IN OUR

02:57:45.654 --> 02:57:48.024
ANALYSIS OF WHAT THE MHC WANTS

02:57:48.090 --> 02:57:51.127
WITH THE APPEALS PROCESS WITH.

02:57:51.193 --> 02:57:53.129

EMAIL THE MHC IN THE ROOM.

02:58:15.184 --> 02:58:16.519
I I I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO

02:58:16.585 --> 02:58:18.454
CHANGE BECAUSE I THINK THIS IS

02:58:18.521 --> 02:58:20.589
WHAT THE MHC -- THIS IS THE

02:58:20.656 --> 02:58:22.425
ROUTE DIRECTION THAT THE CLARITY

02:58:22.491 --> 02:58:25.194
IS IS WARRANTED BUT I'M HAPPY TO

02:58:25.261 --> 02:58:26.562

HEALTHCARE SERVICES AS THE FINE.

02:58:51.987 --> 02:58:53.489
THEN THE NEXT SECTION THIS BILL

02:58:53.556 --> 02:58:54.957
WOULD CLARIFY.

HEALTH CARE SIR THAT'S THE

02:58:58.461 --> 02:59:00.062
EXISTING LAW SO THIS IDEA ALONG

02:59:00.129 --> 02:59:02.364
WITH THAT RETROACTIVITY FROM

02:59:02.431 --> 02:59:03.933
EXISTING LAW ONCE IF THIS BILL

02:59:03.999 --> 02:59:05.101
MOVES FORWARD BUT THAT THE YOU

02:59:05.167 --> 02:59:06.869
DIGEST YOUR READING IS THE

02:59:06.936 --> 02:59:08.237
EXISTING LAW WE'RE NOT.

02:59:08.304 --> 02:59:08.904
CHANGING IT SAYS UNDER IN THAT

02:59:08.971 --> 02:59:10.272
NEXT SESSION THIS BILL WOULD

02:59:10.339 --> 02:59:12.508
CLARIFY AND THEN THAT'S OR TALK

02:59:12.575 --> 02:59:14.443
ABOUT NOW RIGHT WOULD MAKE THE

02:59:14.510 --> 02:59:15.878
EXISTING LAW THAT THEN WOULD

02:59:15.945 --> 02:59:17.680
CLARIFY WHAT THE LAW WAS IN

02:59:17.746 --> 02:59:19.849
JANUARY FIRST.

02:59:19.915 --> 02:59:20.449
TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN SO WE

02:59:20.516 --> 02:59:22.284
TALKING ABOUT GOING BACK TO THAT

02:59:22.351 --> 02:59:29.925
DATE OR ARE WE STILL TALKING

02:59:29.992 --> 02:59:30.559
ABOUT.

02:59:30.626 --> 02:59:31.327
GOING AS FAR BACK AS TWO

02:59:31.393 --> 02:59:33.195
THOUSAND AND TWELVE I THINK

02:59:33.262 --> 02:59:36.599
QUIRK CLARIFYING IT FROM THE TWO

02:59:36.665 --> 02:59:38.667
THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THAT'S SO ANY

02:59:38.734 --> 02:59:40.936
ANY TALK OF RETROACTIVITY WOULD

02:59:41.003 --> 02:59:48.210
ONLY GO BACK AT THIS POINT. TO

02:59:48.277 --> 02:59:48.844
TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN I BELIEVE

02:59:48.911 --> 02:59:51.847
THAT IS CORRECT.

02:59:51.914 --> 02:59:53.449
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- THANK

02:59:55.784 --> 02:59:57.920
ISSUES UP AND I THINK IT DOES --

02:59:57.987 --> 02:59:59.622
AT LEAST FOR ME -- FURTHER

02:59:59.688 --> 03:00:00.990
DISCUSSION MAYBE WE CAN MEET

03:00:01.056 --> 03:00:03.359
WITH YOUR OFFICE AND AND OTHERS

03:00:03.425 --> 03:00:05.528
TO TRY TO CLARIFY THAT COMPONENT

03:00:05.594 --> 03:00:07.496
ABSENT FROM YOUR YOUR TESTIMONY

03:00:07.563 --> 03:00:09.832
TODAY IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S TWO

03:00:09.899 --> 03:00:10.399
THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THAT WERE

03:00:10.466 --> 03:00:11.700
CENTERED AROUND AS FAR AS A

03:00:11.767 --> 03:00:12.334
RETRO.

03:00:12.401 --> 03:00:14.336
ACTIVELY GOING BACK.

03:00:14.403 --> 03:00:16.539
TO IS THAT SOMETHING THAT WERE.

03:00:16.605 --> 03:00:17.439
AGREED.

03:00:17.506 --> 03:00:18.874
TO THAT THAT'S THE RIGHT

03:00:18.941 --> 03:00:20.242
PERCEPTION OF THAT [inaudible]

03:00:20.309 --> 03:00:22.845
SENATOR.

03:00:22.912 --> 03:00:26.048
STRUGGLING MADDOX PLAYING THIS.

03:00:26.115 --> 03:00:26.615
THE STANDARD OF CARE BECAME

03:00:26.682 --> 03:00:28.517
EFFECTIVEIN TWENTY SIXTEEN

03:00:28.584 --> 03:00:29.118
TWENTY SEVENTEEN RIGHT THAT'S

03:00:29.185 --> 03:00:30.085
WHEN THE STANDARD OF CARE WAS

03:00:30.152 --> 03:00:31.086
CREATED.

03:00:31.153 --> 03:00:33.722
WE'RE NOT GOING BACK IN TIME AND

03:00:33.789 --> 03:00:34.757
SAYING.

03:00:34.823 --> 03:00:35.925
THAT WE'RE JUST SAYING THAT THE

03:00:35.991 --> 03:00:38.227
TIMELINE THAT WAS IN EXISTING

03:00:38.294 --> 03:00:40.129
LAW IS THE TIMELINE.

03:00:40.196 --> 03:00:41.664
THE RETROACTIVITY PART IS ON THE

03:00:41.730 --> 03:00:43.032
TREATMENT PART.

03:00:43.098 --> 03:00:45.868
SO FOR EXAMPLE IF SOMEBODY TODAY.

03:00:45.935 --> 03:00:48.370
WAS DIAGNOSED AND THIS LAW WERE

03:00:48.437 --> 03:00:50.906
TO COME INTO EFFECT IN JANUARY.

03:00:50.973 --> 03:00:53.108
THAT PERSON WHO STILL ELIGIBLE

03:00:53.175 --> 03:00:55.044
WHO HASN'T BECOME INFERTILE.

03:00:55.110 --> 03:00:57.580
HAS THIS RETROACTIVE.

03:00:57.646 --> 03:01:00.249
ABILITY TO GET.

03:01:00.316 --> 03:01:02.084
FERTILITY PRESERVATION.

03:01:02.151 --> 03:01:05.454
SO IF SOMEBODY WAS TEN YEARS AGO.

03:01:05.521 --> 03:01:06.655
WE'RE NOT SAYING THAT THEY'RE

03:01:06.722 --> 03:01:08.324
LIABLE FOR NOT GETTING IT BUT IF

03:01:08.390 --> 03:01:10.392
THERE'S SOMEBODY IN THIS WINDOW

03:01:10.459 --> 03:01:12.161
BEFORE THE LAW BECOMES.

03:01:12.228 --> 03:01:14.296
EFFECTIVE.

03:01:14.363 --> 03:01:14.830
THEY'D BE ENTITLED TO THAT

03:01:14.897 --> 03:01:16.198
TREATMENT.

03:01:16.265 --> 03:01:16.999
WHAT IS IT THAT THE THAT'S THE

03:01:17.066 --> 03:01:19.235
THAT'S THE RETROACTIVITY WE'RE

03:01:19.301 --> 03:01:20.736
TALKING ABOUT AND THAT'S THE

03:01:20.803 --> 03:01:22.705
QUESTION OF WHAT WHAT TIME ARE

03:01:22.771 --> 03:01:24.073
WE FOLLOWING BUT THE MEDICAL?

03:01:24.139 --> 03:01:26.308
TREATMENT DEFINES THAT I MEAN IF

03:01:26.375 --> 03:01:27.943
UNFORTUNATELY IN THIS IS WHY

03:01:28.010 --> 03:01:28.978
THIS BILL IS NECESSARY IF

03:01:29.044 --> 03:01:33.616
SOMEBODY HAD CHEMO LAST YEAR.

03:01:33.682 --> 03:01:34.383
UNFORTUNATELY THERE NOW.

03:01:34.450 --> 03:01:36.051
MOST LIKELY INFERTILE.

03:01:36.118 --> 03:01:37.953
SO THEY COULDN'T GET.

03:01:38.020 --> 03:01:39.555
THE FERTILITY PRESERVATION.

03:01:39.622 --> 03:01:41.357
BUT IF SOMEBODY WERE TO BE

03:01:41.423 --> 03:01:42.825
DIAGNOSED TOMORROW.

03:01:42.891 --> 03:01:44.460
AND FOR DIDN'T WANT TO GET

03:01:44.526 --> 03:01:46.762
TREATED UNTIL JANUARY WHEN THIS

03:01:46.829 --> 03:01:49.431
BECOMES LAW.

03:01:49.498 --> 03:01:53.135
THEY WOULD BE ENTITLED FOR THAT.

03:01:53.202 --> 03:01:55.104
TAKE A STATE BECAUSE THEY ARE

03:01:55.170 --> 03:01:58.040
NOT INFERTILE RIGHT NOW.

03:01:58.107 --> 03:01:59.942
IT WHEN WE LOOK FORWARD TO TO

03:02:00.009 --> 03:02:01.010
DISCUSS ANY OF THEM IS THAT

03:02:01.076 --> 03:02:01.610
RIGHT.

03:02:01.677 --> 03:02:03.145
I THOUGHT THAT WOULD MAKE IT

03:02:03.212 --> 03:02:06.215
CLEAR HAVE IT ALL OF THAT'S MY

03:02:06.282 --> 03:02:09.318
CLOTHES THANK.

03:02:09.385 --> 03:02:11.086

YEAH [inaudible]

03:02:12.288 --> 03:02:14.156
MISTER RODRIGUEZ.

03:02:14.223 --> 03:02:15.791
AND NOT JUST CONTINUE THE

03:02:15.858 --> 03:02:17.893
DISCUSSION OF RETROACTIVITY

03:02:17.960 --> 03:02:19.161

03:02:19.228 --> 03:02:21.063
ISSUE THE ROUND UP ON IF THIS

03:02:21.130 --> 03:02:22.831
BILL GOES OUT OUR HOPE -- CENTER

03:02:22.898 --> 03:02:23.332
YOU CAN CONTINUE WORKING

03:02:23.399 --> 03:02:23.966

IT FOR BILL GETS OUT THANKS

03:02:32.574 --> 03:02:32.808
[inaudible]

03:02:32.875 --> 03:02:36.879
ANYONE ELSE.

03:02:36.945 --> 03:02:37.513
THANK YOU I THINK I WOULD LOVE

03:02:37.579 --> 03:02:38.580
TO KNOW YOU HAVE SOME COMMENTS

03:02:38.647 --> 03:02:42.017
ON ON SOME OF THOSE DISCUSSIONS

03:02:42.084 --> 03:02:44.219
HAVE BEEN THE LAST YEAR.

03:02:44.286 --> 03:02:45.087
YEAH I MEAN SO I ITEMS TO READ

03:02:45.154 --> 03:02:46.121
FROM THE BILL BECAUSE I THINK --

03:02:46.188 --> 03:02:48.123
IT'S PRETTY CLEAR -- VIEW DITION

03:02:48.190 --> 03:02:50.993
OF THIS SECTION -- TO THE HEALTH

03:02:51.060 --> 03:02:51.560
AND SAFETY CODE ME INSURANCE

03:02:51.627 --> 03:02:52.561
CODE DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A

03:02:52.628 --> 03:02:54.029
CHANGING BUT IS DECLARATORY OF

03:02:54.096 --> 03:02:55.864
EXISTING LAW THERE NO PARAMETERS

03:02:55.931 --> 03:02:56.765
AROUND.

03:02:56.832 --> 03:02:57.833
I'M IN EVEN IF THEY WERE WE

03:02:57.900 --> 03:02:59.234
WOULD STILL OPPOSE THAT WE DON'T

03:02:59.301 --> 03:03:00.569
BELIEVE THAT BENEFIT MANDATES

03:03:00.636 --> 03:03:02.471
CAN BE MADE RETROACTIVE.

03:03:02.538 --> 03:03:04.840
BECAUSE THE STANDARD OF CARE

03:03:04.907 --> 03:03:06.508
THAT WAS REFERENCED EARLIER IS

03:03:06.575 --> 03:03:07.576
THE STANDARD OF CARE CHANGE THAT

03:03:07.643 --> 03:03:09.044
WAS MADE UNILATERALLY BY THE

03:03:09.111 --> 03:03:10.813
STATE REGULATOR IN THE STATE

03:03:10.879 --> 03:03:13.315
REGULATOR CAN NOT RIGHT THE LAW.

03:03:13.382 --> 03:03:15.250

AT THE EXISTING LAWS YOU SIDE SO

03:11:00.582 --> 03:11:02.050
THOSE REMAIN INTACT.

03:11:02.117 --> 03:11:02.717

03:11:02.784 --> 03:11:03.485
THE POINT I'M GETTING AT AND I

03:11:03.552 --> 03:11:04.886
THINK THE CONCERN OF THE HEALTH

03:11:04.953 --> 03:11:06.254

MIGHT.

03:11:07.556 --> 03:11:09.090

THAT ON THERE MIGHT BE PEOPLE

03:11:15.564 --> 03:11:16.631
PAID OUT OF POCKET I?

03:11:16.698 --> 03:11:18.133

WHAT CITY I SAYS THAT IT'S NOT A

03:11:23.705 --> 03:11:26.474
COVERED BENEFIT SO SO THERE IS

03:11:26.541 --> 03:11:27.809
CONCERN ABOUT THAT SO IT IS.

03:11:27.876 --> 03:11:30.645
A BIT UNPRECEDENTED FOR US TO GO

03:11:34.282 --> 03:11:42.023
THAT'S THAT'S MY CONCERN STATE

03:11:42.090 --> 03:11:44.326

RESOLVED TO GET OUT?

03:11:48.163 --> 03:11:49.464

03:11:49.531 --> 03:11:51.499

03:11:51.566 --> 03:11:53.702
GOD FORBID A COURT.

03:11:53.768 --> 03:11:56.104
I DON'T KNOW WE THINK THE BILL

03:11:56.171 --> 03:11:57.505
RESOLVES IT [inaudible]

03:11:57.572 --> 03:12:00.108
OKAY [inaudible]

03:12:00.175 --> 03:12:03.845
MR SANTIAGO.

03:12:03.912 --> 03:12:05.046
I'M ON THE MUCH I COULD ADD TO

03:12:05.113 --> 03:12:05.714
IT OTHER THAN I WAS A LITTLE --

03:12:05.780 --> 03:12:06.915
I THINK A LITTLE BIT CONFUSED AS

03:12:06.982 --> 03:12:07.716
WELL.

03:12:07.782 --> 03:12:13.421

03:12:13.488 --> 03:12:14.456
RETROACTIVITY OR NOT.

03:12:14.522 --> 03:12:20.195
I'M STRUGGLING.

03:12:20.262 --> 03:12:21.062
TO HOW TO GET DOWN AND I'M STILL

03:12:21.129 --> 03:12:23.865
SUPPORTED BY THE LIKE HOW YOU.

03:12:23.932 --> 03:12:24.432
REALLY GET THERE BECAUSE YOU

03:12:24.499 --> 03:12:25.800
CAN'T HAVE. THREE DIFFERENT

03:12:25.867 --> 03:12:27.969
POSITIONS.

03:12:28.036 --> 03:12:30.105
WITH THREE DIFFERENT SUGGESTIONS

03:12:30.171 --> 03:12:31.539
RIGHT.

03:12:31.606 --> 03:12:32.574
THAT'S WHY I'M SAYING I'M OPEN

03:12:32.641 --> 03:12:33.675
TO THAT CONVERSATION.

03:12:33.742 --> 03:12:34.676
BUT IN EVERYTHING THAT'S BROUGHT

03:12:34.743 --> 03:12:35.543
US TO THIS POINT WITH THE

03:12:35.610 --> 03:12:36.111
INMATES SEE.

03:12:36.177 --> 03:12:38.413
THIS IS WHAT WE FEEL CLARIFIES

03:12:38.480 --> 03:12:39.447
AND CODIFIES WITHOUT CHANGING

03:12:39.514 --> 03:12:42.284
THOSE TIME LINES IN EXISTING LAW.

03:12:42.350 --> 03:12:43.385
SO THAT'S WHY WE DON'T THINK

03:12:43.451 --> 03:12:45.420
THIS IS OPENING UP ANYBODY TO

03:12:45.487 --> 03:12:47.989
ANY ADDITIONAL LIABILITY

03:12:48.056 --> 03:12:48.290
[inaudible]

03:12:48.356 --> 03:12:55.597
THAT'S MY OPINION.

03:12:55.664 --> 03:12:58.166
CAN WE ADD ONE MORE THING.

03:12:58.233 --> 03:13:01.002
CAN I JUST ADD -- AS A PATIENT

03:13:01.069 --> 03:13:02.237
ADVOCATE OF SORRY.

03:13:02.304 --> 03:13:18.386
YEP

03:13:23.291 --> 03:13:23.358
.

03:13:23.358 --> 03:13:23.858
I'M SORRY I'M TRYING TO GET

03:13:23.925 --> 03:13:40.375
CLARIFICATION ON SOMETHING

03:13:59.260 --> 03:13:59.327
.

03:13:59.327 --> 03:14:00.428
I'M SORRY I WAS ASKING FOR SOME

03:14:00.495 --> 03:14:02.364
CLARIFICATION ON SOME NUMBERS SO

03:14:02.430 --> 03:14:05.734
SO PLEASE YOU CAN GO AHEAD.

03:14:05.800 --> 03:14:06.801
SORRY I'M SO.

03:14:06.868 --> 03:14:09.170
I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT AS YOU

03:14:09.237 --> 03:14:10.839
KNOW WE'VE MADE A GOOD FAITH

03:14:10.905 --> 03:14:12.040
EFFORT AS SORT OF THE

03:14:12.107 --> 03:14:13.041
REPRESENTATIVE OF THE PATIENT

03:14:13.108 --> 03:14:14.609
ADVOCACY COMMUNITY THAT'S BEEN

03:14:14.676 --> 03:14:15.977
WORKING ON THIS FOR MANY YEARS

03:14:16.044 --> 03:14:17.278
WITH SENATOR PORTANTINO. TO

03:14:17.345 --> 03:14:19.981
UNDERSTAND -- WHETHER THIS WAS

03:14:20.048 --> 03:14:21.082
SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE COVERED

03:14:21.149 --> 03:14:22.617
IT WAS ALWAYS BEING EXCLUDED

03:14:22.684 --> 03:14:23.651
BECAUSE IT WAS BEING CATEGORIZED

03:14:23.718 --> 03:14:26.221
AS AN INFERTILITY TREATMENT.

03:14:26.287 --> 03:14:27.422
AND THAT IS WHAT I THINK HAS

03:14:27.489 --> 03:14:29.491
ALWAYS OR HISTORICALLY BEEN

03:14:29.557 --> 03:14:30.558
EXCLUDED.

03:14:30.625 --> 03:14:32.260
FERTILITY PRESERVATION WAS NOT

03:14:32.327 --> 03:14:35.463
AND EXPRESS EXCLUSION IN THESE

03:14:35.530 --> 03:14:36.965
PLANS I MEAN THIS IS A A

03:14:37.032 --> 03:14:38.066
TREATMENT THAT IS MEANT TO

03:14:38.133 --> 03:14:40.101
PREVENT STERILITY IN THESE

03:14:40.168 --> 03:14:41.536
PATIENTS AND THEY HAVE NO.

03:14:41.603 --> 03:14:43.271
CHOICE BUT TO UNDERGO CANCER

03:14:43.338 --> 03:14:44.906
TREATMENT RIGHT THEIR LIVES AT

03:14:44.973 --> 03:14:48.043
RISK AND SO THE THE HIGH COST OF

03:14:48.109 --> 03:14:49.711
THE SERVICES PUTS IT OUT OF

03:14:49.778 --> 03:14:50.745
REACH UNLESS THEY DO IT

03:14:50.812 --> 03:14:51.613
IMMEDIATELY.

03:14:51.679 --> 03:14:53.081
AND SO WE WERE TRYING TO

03:14:53.148 --> 03:14:54.983
DISTINGUISH AND UNDERSTAND HOW

03:14:55.050 --> 03:14:58.186
THE REGULATOR -- EVEN VIEWED

03:14:58.253 --> 03:15:00.355
THIS SERVICE WHETHER PREVENTION

03:15:00.422 --> 03:15:02.057
OF STERILIZATION IF YOU WILL IS

03:15:02.123 --> 03:15:03.758
SOMETHING BASIC AS A BASIC

03:15:03.825 --> 03:15:05.627
HEALTH CARE SERVICE THAT SOMEONE

03:15:05.693 --> 03:15:06.294
IS ENTITLED.

03:15:06.361 --> 03:15:07.929
TO AND YOU KNOW AFTER ALL OF OUR

03:15:07.996 --> 03:15:10.498
MEETINGS AND DISCUSSIONS ARE

03:15:10.565 --> 03:15:11.132
UNDERSTANDING FROM DIEM EACH SEE

03:15:11.199 --> 03:15:11.332
WAS.

03:15:11.399 --> 03:15:12.667
YES THIS IS HOW WE VIEW THIS

03:15:12.734 --> 03:15:14.069
THIS IS A BASIC HEALTH CARE

03:15:14.135 --> 03:15:15.403
SERVICE AND SO IF IT'S MEDICALLY

03:15:15.470 --> 03:15:17.038
NECESSARY FOR THAT PATIENT

03:15:17.105 --> 03:15:17.772
MEANING.

03:15:17.839 --> 03:15:19.374
THEY'RE FACING POTENTIALLY

03:15:19.441 --> 03:15:20.842
STERILIZING TREATMENT THEN IT'S

03:15:20.909 --> 03:15:22.410
A COVERED SERVICE AND IT SHOULD

03:15:22.477 --> 03:15:24.679
BE -- COVERED BY THE INSURANCE

03:15:24.746 --> 03:15:27.015
COMPANY AND THAT IS WHAT WE'VE

03:15:27.082 --> 03:15:28.516
BEEN WORKING THROUGH FOR THE

03:15:28.583 --> 03:15:29.951
PAST SEVERAL YEARS AND SO THE

03:15:30.018 --> 03:15:31.519
PURPOSE OF THE LANGUAGE OF THE

03:15:31.586 --> 03:15:33.054
BILL IN MY UNDERSTANDING WAS.

03:15:33.121 --> 03:15:36.524
NOT TO GO BACK AND CREATE ANY

03:15:36.591 --> 03:15:38.126
KIND OF YOU KNOW LIABILITY ON

03:15:38.193 --> 03:15:39.327
YOU KNOW FOR ANYONE IT WAS

03:15:39.394 --> 03:15:41.029
REALLY JUST TO BE PERFECTLY

03:15:41.096 --> 03:15:41.863
CLEAR.

03:15:41.930 --> 03:15:43.998
THAT THIS IS ALREADY SOMETHING

03:15:44.065 --> 03:15:45.934
THAT SHOULD BE CUT BEING COVERED

03:15:46.000 --> 03:15:47.335
FOR THESE PATIENTS AND THAT THAT

03:15:47.402 --> 03:15:47.869
WAS THE POSITION OF THE

03:15:47.936 --> 03:15:48.937
REGULATOR.

03:15:49.003 --> 03:15:50.705
AND SO WE WERE TRYING TO CAPTURE

03:15:50.772 --> 03:15:53.041
THAT IT WAS NOT. TO CREATE SOME

03:15:53.108 --> 03:15:59.080
LONG TRAIN OF LIABILITY.

03:15:59.147 --> 03:16:00.582
ESPECIALLY SINCE THOSE DATES ARE

03:16:00.648 --> 03:16:01.950
ALREADY CODIFIED WE'RE NOT

03:16:02.016 --> 03:16:03.318
CHANGING THOSE STATES.

03:16:03.384 --> 03:16:06.921
SO IS IT AND AND AND I AND I

03:16:09.524 --> 03:16:10.492
HANG ON TO IT.

03:16:10.558 --> 03:16:12.093
I APOLOGIZE BECAUSE THIS HAS

03:16:12.160 --> 03:16:12.894
GOTTEN A LITTLE CONVOLUTED HERE

03:16:12.961 --> 03:16:16.364
SO IS IT YOUR IMPRESSION THEN

03:16:16.431 --> 03:16:18.633
FROM YOUR FROM.

03:16:18.700 --> 03:16:20.401

03:16:25.840 --> 03:16:26.541
IN THEIR VIEW AN ESSENTIAL

03:16:26.608 --> 03:16:28.343
HEALTH BENEFIT [inaudible]

03:16:28.409 --> 03:16:30.278
YES.

03:16:30.345 --> 03:16:33.715
BASIC HEALTH BETTER YES BUT THAT.

03:16:33.781 --> 03:16:34.616
BUT WILL DEBATE THE ESSENTIAL

03:16:34.682 --> 03:16:37.218
HEALTH BENEFITS ARE DEFINEDBY

03:16:37.285 --> 03:16:39.053
THE A FOUR BY OUR BY COVER

03:16:39.120 --> 03:16:39.587
CALIFORNIA.

03:16:39.654 --> 03:16:40.155
THAT'S WHERE I THINK THAT'S

03:16:40.221 --> 03:16:41.156
WHERE THE I THINK THAT'S WHERE

03:16:41.222 --> 03:16:42.323
THE DISCONNECT IS HERE BECAUSE I

03:16:42.390 --> 03:16:44.592
I DON'T BELIEVE.

03:16:44.659 --> 03:16:45.126
IT IS AN ESSENTIAL HEALTH

03:16:45.193 --> 03:16:47.529
BENEFIT AND AND THAT IS WHERE

03:16:47.595 --> 03:16:48.730
THAT IS SO THAT'S WHERE THE

03:16:48.796 --> 03:16:52.133

THEY'RE SAYING IT'S A BASIC

03:16:54.335 --> 03:16:57.705
HEALTH NEED WHICH IS DIFFERENT

03:16:57.772 --> 03:17:00.108
THAN AN ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFIT.

03:17:00.175 --> 03:17:00.909
I THINK THAT'S WHY I HAVE TO DIE

03:17:00.975 --> 03:17:01.709
AS A REALLY IMPORTANT PART OF

03:17:01.776 --> 03:17:02.410
THIS CONVERSATION YEAH THAT IS A

03:17:02.477 --> 03:17:03.478
REALLY IMPORTANT PART OF THIS

03:17:03.545 --> 03:17:04.679
CONVERSATION.

03:17:04.746 --> 03:17:06.347
OUR UNDERSTANDING FROM THE MHC

03:17:06.414 --> 03:17:07.549
IS THAT -- THAT THIS IS A BASIC

03:17:07.615 --> 03:17:09.083
HEALTHCARE SERVICE AS PER KNOCKS

03:17:09.150 --> 03:17:11.753
KEEN AND THAT THAT'S WHERE THE

03:17:11.819 --> 03:17:14.989
COVERAGE FOR THE CLARIFICATION

03:17:15.056 --> 03:17:17.358
COMES INTO PLAY [inaudible]

03:17:17.425 --> 03:17:21.362
OKAY.

03:17:26.801 --> 03:17:29.070
ONCE.

03:17:29.137 --> 03:17:30.471
I THINK YOU JUST CHARACTERIZED

03:17:30.538 --> 03:17:32.740

03:17:32.807 --> 03:17:33.408
THIS IS WHAT WE'RE SOUNDING HERE

03:17:33.474 --> 03:17:35.810
IN SOME WAY -- I THINK YOU HAVE

03:17:35.877 --> 03:17:36.411
THE PLANTS WHO ARE SAYING IT'S

03:17:36.477 --> 03:17:36.744
NOT COVERED.

03:17:36.811 --> 03:17:38.546
IS THAT CORRECT.

03:17:38.613 --> 03:17:39.547
THAT'S WHAT YOU RECOGNIZE.

03:17:39.614 --> 03:17:40.715
THAT'S WHAT YOU'LL REPRESENT SO

03:17:40.782 --> 03:17:42.283
WHEN SOMEONE COMES TO YOU YOU'RE

03:17:42.350 --> 03:17:43.718
GOING TO CHALLENGE THAT.

03:17:43.785 --> 03:17:45.086
AND ANDERSON TO BE AN ISSUE OF

03:17:45.153 --> 03:17:45.653
THAT IN A COURT.

03:17:45.720 --> 03:17:48.489
WE'RE HERE TO SOLVE THE ISSUE.

03:17:48.556 --> 03:17:49.424
IT SEEMS THE DISCONNECT IS THE

03:17:49.490 --> 03:17:51.559
DATE OF TIME TO WIN THIS STARTS

03:17:51.626 --> 03:17:52.760
SO THEY EITHER YOU CAN COME BACK

03:17:52.827 --> 03:17:53.962
AND BIT IT AS A PROGRAM.

03:17:54.028 --> 03:17:55.697
THAT HAS A SERVICE SENATE

03:17:55.763 --> 03:17:55.997
[inaudible]

03:17:56.064 --> 03:17:57.599
OR NOT.

03:17:57.665 --> 03:17:58.833
BUT IT'LL BE A REQUIREMENT FROM

03:17:58.900 --> 03:18:01.536
THIS LEGISLATURE SO YOU NEED I

03:18:01.603 --> 03:18:03.438
THINK SENATOR TO CHOOSE A DATE

03:18:03.504 --> 03:18:04.806

THAT THIS BILL TAKES EFFECT.

03:18:11.913 --> 03:18:13.715
AND THAT WOULD PROBABLY BE A

03:18:13.781 --> 03:18:15.984
DATE AFTER SOME DATE IN JANUARY

03:18:16.050 --> 03:18:18.186

03:18:19.621 --> 03:18:21.022
PLACE.

IT SEEMS LIKE THAT WOULD BE THE

03:18:22.390 --> 03:18:24.425
EASIEST SOLUTION HERE.

03:18:24.492 --> 03:18:26.227
WHY WOULD YOU?

03:18:26.294 --> 03:18:29.831
WITH THAT NOT WORK FOR YOU.

03:18:29.897 --> 03:18:30.365

PARAMETERS AROUND THIS INCLUDING

THE REMOVAL OF THE DECLARATORY

HEARD PRETTY MUCH.

03:23:01.836 --> 03:23:02.937

03:23:24.258 --> 03:23:26.460
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

03:23:26.527 --> 03:23:27.495

FIRST TAKE ON IT.

03:23:33.000 --> 03:23:36.137
