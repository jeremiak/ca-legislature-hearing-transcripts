01:20:04.132 --> 01:20:07.135
NAIL. FOR FOR FOR THE NAIL SHE

01:20:07.202 --> 01:20:08.837
WAS LOST FOR WANT OF A SHOE THE

01:20:08.904 --> 01:20:09.971
HORSE WAS LOST FOR THE HORSE

01:20:10.038 --> 01:20:11.907

SOMETHING GREATER.

01:20:37.732 --> 01:20:38.633
I THINK THAT IS THE REAL

01:20:38.700 --> 01:20:40.001
CHALLENGE OF LEADERSHIP IN THIS

LEADERSHIP.

01:20:45.907 --> 01:20:47.576
AND I THINK THIS BILL FITS INTO

01:20:47.642 --> 01:20:48.410
THAT.

01:20:48.476 --> 01:20:49.945

01:20:57.852 --> 01:21:00.055
GROWS INTO SOMETHING SO MUCH

01:21:00.121 --> 01:21:01.523
MORE CONSEQUENTIAL.

01:21:01.590 --> 01:21:04.392
SOUL -- I WILL SAY I AM NOT THE

01:21:04.459 --> 01:21:07.429

FIVE SEVENTY SIX ADDITIONAL

01:54:14.047 --> 01:54:16.282
WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION.

01:54:16.349 --> 01:54:17.884
SEEING NINE COMMENTS AND

01:54:17.951 --> 01:54:23.389
QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE.

01:54:23.456 --> 01:54:25.225
JUST THE ONE THE GENTLEMAN THAT

01:54:25.291 --> 01:54:27.427
SPOKE TO TALK ABOUT THERE'S FIVE

01:54:27.493 --> 01:54:30.463
DIFFERENT TAXING AGENCIES -- IT

01:54:30.530 --> 01:54:32.699
IS THE GOAL WITH CD TFA TO

01:54:32.765 --> 01:54:36.603
BECOME THE ONE STOP SHOP FOR ALL --

01:54:36.669 --> 01:54:38.638
FIVE AGENCIES IS IS THAT THE

01:54:38.705 --> 01:54:40.640
GOAL.

01:54:40.707 --> 01:54:42.208
THE END THAT'S THE CONVERSATION

01:54:42.275 --> 01:54:43.142
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE HAVING AS

01:54:43.209 --> 01:54:44.944
WELL HI I CAN TELL YOU THAT

01:54:45.011 --> 01:54:49.048
THAT'S I'D LIKE TO SEE US GET TO

01:54:49.115 --> 01:54:49.349
SOME PLACE.

01:54:49.415 --> 01:54:54.153
OF WHERE WE HAVE A TAX AGENCY

01:54:54.220 --> 01:54:55.855
THAT COULD BE A SERVE AS A ONE

01:54:55.922 --> 01:55:00.193
STOP SHOP -- I THINK

01:55:00.260 --> 01:55:02.128
THE ACA.

01:55:02.195 --> 01:55:04.063
MORE SO THAN THIS BILL.

01:55:04.130 --> 01:55:06.499
IS WHERE WE REALLY HAVE THAT

01:55:06.566 --> 01:55:08.268
CONVERSATION AND ON AN ONGOING

01:55:08.334 --> 01:55:09.469
BASIS.

01:55:09.535 --> 01:55:12.138
THIS MERELY JUST SAYS IF THE ACA

01:55:12.205 --> 01:55:13.573
WERE TOUGH PASS.

01:55:13.640 --> 01:55:16.409
BOTH HOUSES IF IT WAS TO PASS A

01:55:16.476 --> 01:55:18.111
PUBLIC VOTE.

01:55:18.177 --> 01:55:19.946
HOW WOULD WE DETERMINE WHAT THE

01:55:20.013 --> 01:55:23.016
REST OF THE DUTIES CURRENTLY?

01:55:23.082 --> 01:55:25.218
THAT THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION

01:55:25.285 --> 01:55:29.088
HAS IS -- DISSEMINATED AND

01:55:29.155 --> 01:55:29.355
ADDRESSED.

01:55:29.422 --> 01:55:31.190
SO.

01:55:31.257 --> 01:55:32.692
I WOULD LIKE FOR US TO ACTUALLY

01:55:32.759 --> 01:55:34.827
HAVE THAT CONVERSATION BECAUSE I

01:55:34.894 --> 01:55:36.929
THINK -- THERE IS ALSO

01:55:36.996 --> 01:55:38.731
FRUSTRATION.

01:55:38.798 --> 01:55:41.567
ABOUT -- THE NUMBER OF PLACES

01:55:41.634 --> 01:55:43.269
THAT EVERYONE NEEDS TO GO TO LET

01:55:43.336 --> 01:55:44.771
ALONE THE FACT THAT YOU'RE ALSO

01:55:44.837 --> 01:55:46.372
DEALING WITH NOT JUST FEDERAL

01:55:46.439 --> 01:55:47.273
STATE.

01:55:47.340 --> 01:55:49.309
AND LOCAL ADMINISTRATIONS FOR

01:55:49.375 --> 01:55:50.810
TAX PURPOSES.

01:55:50.877 --> 01:55:52.679
IN LOS ANGELES FOR EXAMPLE

01:55:52.745 --> 01:55:54.147
THERE'S THE BUSINESS TAX THAT.

01:55:54.213 --> 01:55:57.250
REALLY CREATES -- A LOT OF

01:55:57.317 --> 01:55:59.118
CHALLENGES FOR SPECIALLY SMALL

01:55:59.185 --> 01:56:00.520
BUSINESSES THAT OPERATE OUT OF

01:56:00.586 --> 01:56:01.387
THEIR HOME.

01:56:01.454 --> 01:56:02.789
AND A LOT OF TIMES THEY END UP

01:56:02.855 --> 01:56:05.058
MISSING THE DEADLINES AND THEN

01:56:05.124 --> 01:56:06.225
HAVE TO FIND OUT AFTER SUS

01:56:06.292 --> 01:56:07.393
SEVERE PENALTIES HAVE BEEN

01:56:07.460 --> 01:56:08.561
ADDRESSED SO.

01:56:08.628 --> 01:56:10.063
I AM VERY SENSITIVE TO THAT AS A

01:56:10.129 --> 01:56:12.165
FORMER SMALL BUSINESS OWNER

01:56:12.231 --> 01:56:15.902
MYSELF I I RECEIVE THOSE NOTICES.

01:56:15.968 --> 01:56:18.271
SO I I AM HAPPY TO DISCUSS

01:56:18.338 --> 01:56:19.972
MOVING FORWARD HOW THAT GETS

01:56:20.039 --> 01:56:22.275
ADDRESSED.

01:56:22.342 --> 01:56:23.276
SO THEN THE SECOND.

01:56:23.343 --> 01:56:25.345
IT SEEMS AS THOUGH.

01:56:25.411 --> 01:56:26.679
AND IN FOR FOR SOMEBODY LIKE ME

01:56:26.746 --> 01:56:28.047
THAT WANTS TO WANTS GOVERNMENT

01:56:28.114 --> 01:56:29.882
TO BE EFFICIENT -- I DON'T

01:56:29.949 --> 01:56:31.651
PHILOSOPHICALLY HAVE A PROBLEM

01:56:31.718 --> 01:56:33.619
WITH REORGANIZATION FACT I THINK

01:56:33.686 --> 01:56:35.888
IT WOULD MAKE SENSE. FOR US TO

01:56:35.955 --> 01:56:37.423
BE ABLE TO TO DO THAT I'M

01:56:37.490 --> 01:56:39.125
SOMEBODY WOULD WOULD ADVOCATE

01:56:39.192 --> 01:56:39.992
FOR A ONE STOP SHOP.

01:56:40.059 --> 01:56:42.528
I HAVE ONE AGENCY THAT COLLECTS

01:56:42.595 --> 01:56:43.363
ONE STATE AGENCY COLLECTS ALL

01:56:43.429 --> 01:56:45.064
THE STATE.

01:56:45.131 --> 01:56:46.766
A STATE REVENUE -- BUT IN THE

01:56:46.833 --> 01:56:48.201
SECOND QUESTION IS WILL WHO IS

01:56:48.267 --> 01:56:50.803
THE ULTIMATE ARBITER OF OF THAT --

01:56:50.870 --> 01:56:53.339
SHOULD IT BE A BUREAUCRAT --

01:56:53.406 --> 01:56:54.941
THAT MAKES THOSE DECISIONS --

01:56:55.007 --> 01:56:56.743
SHOULD BE SOME OF ITS APPOINTED

01:56:56.809 --> 01:56:59.011
BY THE GOVERNOR SHOULD THERE BE

01:56:59.078 --> 01:57:00.713
A BOARDS APPOINTED BY THE

01:57:00.780 --> 01:57:02.415
LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE LEADERS

01:57:02.482 --> 01:57:04.417
OR SHOULD THOSE BE ELECTED

01:57:04.484 --> 01:57:06.519
OFFICIALS THAT MAKE -- THAT THE

01:57:06.586 --> 01:57:08.421
THAT MAKE THOSE APPOINTMENTS --

01:57:08.488 --> 01:57:10.423
TO MAKE THOSE THOSE DECISIONS

01:57:10.490 --> 01:57:11.758
AND I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE

01:57:11.824 --> 01:57:13.226
ARGUMENTS THAT I HEAR FROM --

01:57:13.292 --> 01:57:14.327
THE FOLKS THE BOARD OF

01:57:14.394 --> 01:57:15.928
EQUALIZATION IS THAT THEY WERE

01:57:15.995 --> 01:57:17.764
BUT THAT THEY WERE VOTED BY DULY

01:57:17.830 --> 01:57:18.765
ELECTED.

01:57:18.831 --> 01:57:20.733
BY THE PEOPLE OF OF CALIFORNIA

01:57:20.800 --> 01:57:22.402
TO MAKE THESE DECISIONS AND WE

01:57:22.468 --> 01:57:24.904
SHOULDN'T LET THOSE DECISIONS BE

01:57:24.971 --> 01:57:26.372
MADE -- PUT PUT IN THE HANDS OF

01:57:26.439 --> 01:57:28.207
OF OF OF ANOTHER BOARD I REALIZE

01:57:28.274 --> 01:57:30.343
THAT'S NOT DIRECTLY RELATED TO

01:57:30.410 --> 01:57:31.978
THIS -- AND THE AND THE AND THE

01:57:32.044 --> 01:57:33.446
BUT THE BILL THAT'S BEFORE US

01:57:33.513 --> 01:57:34.981
BUT IT DOES STILL APPLIED IS

01:57:35.047 --> 01:57:36.382
STILL GERMANE. TO THE

01:57:36.449 --> 01:57:39.118
CONVERSATION SO -- YOU KNOW GET

01:57:39.185 --> 01:57:40.720
WHAT WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ON ON

01:57:40.787 --> 01:57:42.922
THAT IT'S GERMANE AND AND I I

01:57:42.989 --> 01:57:44.624
WAS SMILING AS YOU WERE SAYING

01:57:44.690 --> 01:57:46.459
THIS BECAUSE YOU KNOW UP WHILE

01:57:46.526 --> 01:57:47.894
WHILE WE WOULD ALL DISCUSS THE

01:57:47.960 --> 01:57:49.228
MERITS OF THAT ISSUE IT ALSO

01:57:49.295 --> 01:57:50.696
TAKES A CERTAIN INDIVIDUAL WHO'S

01:57:50.763 --> 01:57:52.999
BEEN A STAFFER. FOR A LONG TIME

01:57:53.065 --> 01:57:55.001
AND SEEN WHAT REPRIEVE TO

01:57:55.067 --> 01:57:57.870
CONSTITUENTS MEANS -- JUST TO

01:57:57.937 --> 01:58:00.072
USE THE PREVIOUS BILL THAT WE

01:58:00.139 --> 01:58:05.445
JUST LET YOU ALL VOTED ON WHICH

01:58:05.511 --> 01:58:07.747
EIGHT THANK YOU -- FOR A. B..

01:58:07.814 --> 01:58:08.314
THREE FIFTY SEVEN THIS IS A

01:58:08.381 --> 01:58:08.981
ISSUE THAT CAME TO ME BECAUSE OF

01:58:09.048 --> 01:58:09.348
A CONSTITUENT.

01:58:09.415 --> 01:58:11.818
WHO HAD PENALTIES?

01:58:11.884 --> 01:58:13.619
AT LEVELS WHERE.

01:58:13.686 --> 01:58:14.987
THERE WAS NO WAY HE WAS GONNA

01:58:15.054 --> 01:58:16.656
MAKE THOSE PAYMENTS.

01:58:16.722 --> 01:58:18.724
AND IF IT WAS RUNNING FOR OVER

01:58:18.791 --> 01:58:20.393
THIRTY YEARS.

01:58:20.460 --> 01:58:23.229
AND SO WHEN WE WORKED WITH.

01:58:23.296 --> 01:58:24.530
FRANCHISE TAX BOARD TO ADDRESS

01:58:24.597 --> 01:58:26.132
THE ISSUES.

01:58:26.199 --> 01:58:27.500
WE THEN STARTED TALKING TO

01:58:27.567 --> 01:58:29.268
DIFFERENT ATTORNEYS.

01:58:29.335 --> 01:58:31.704
OF GOING BACK TO WHAT WE WOULD

01:58:31.771 --> 01:58:33.873
DO A STAFFERS AND AND WE REALIZE

01:58:33.940 --> 01:58:35.441
THAT.

01:58:35.508 --> 01:58:36.609
COURSE MY STAFF WAS DOING THIS

01:58:36.676 --> 01:58:38.311
AND WE REALIZE THAT THERE WAS A

01:58:38.377 --> 01:58:40.446
BILL IN NEED TO ADDRESS.

01:58:40.513 --> 01:58:42.114
AND CHANGE THE PRACTICES IN

01:58:42.181 --> 01:58:44.684
PLACE WHEN WE TALK TO FTP THEY

01:58:44.750 --> 01:58:47.753
SAID THAT THEY HAD WANTED TO

01:58:47.820 --> 01:58:49.288
ADDRESS THIS ISSUE THEMSELVES.

01:58:49.355 --> 01:58:50.490
BUT THAT THEY JUST HAVEN'T BEEN

01:58:50.556 --> 01:58:51.858
ABLE.

01:58:51.924 --> 01:58:53.526
TO AND SO WE OFFER TO DO A BILL

01:58:53.593 --> 01:58:55.495
AND WORK WITH THEM. TO ADDRESS

01:58:55.561 --> 01:58:57.997
IT -- REASON WHY I BRING THIS UP

01:58:58.064 --> 01:59:00.166
IS BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY

01:59:00.233 --> 01:59:02.802
IT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY.

01:59:02.869 --> 01:59:05.238
AS ELECTED OFFICIALS. TO LISTEN

01:59:05.304 --> 01:59:07.039
TO OUR CONSTITUENTS AND ADDRESS

01:59:07.106 --> 01:59:08.174
THE NEEDS IF.

01:59:08.241 --> 01:59:09.642
THAT SAME INDIVIDUAL WHO CAME TO

01:59:09.709 --> 01:59:10.676
ME.

01:59:10.743 --> 01:59:12.445
HAD COME TO YOU AND YOUR

01:59:12.512 --> 01:59:13.079
DISTRICT YOU WOULD HAVE DONE THE

01:59:13.145 --> 01:59:15.715
SAME -- IN FACT I I WOULDN'T OF

01:59:15.781 --> 01:59:17.116
TURN THEM OVER TO ANY OTHER

01:59:17.183 --> 01:59:19.385
AGENCY I WOULD CALL THE AGENCY

01:59:19.452 --> 01:59:20.820
MYSELF AND SAY.

01:59:20.887 --> 01:59:23.856
I WANT TO KNOW EDUCATE ME ABOUT

01:59:23.923 --> 01:59:25.458
WHY THIS ISN'T WORKING OR WHY

01:59:25.525 --> 01:59:28.094
THIS ISSUE IS FALLING APART.

01:59:28.160 --> 01:59:29.996
AND WHY IS IT THAT.

01:59:30.062 --> 01:59:31.230
THIS HASN'T BEEN ADDRESSED FOR

01:59:31.297 --> 01:59:34.367
THIS LONG OF A TIME.

01:59:34.433 --> 01:59:36.068
WE'VE ALL AT AND ANOTHER PART OF

01:59:36.135 --> 01:59:37.603
THIS IS THAT WE EVOLVE.

01:59:37.670 --> 01:59:39.539
AND WHAT WE SAW THAT THERE WAS A

01:59:39.605 --> 01:59:41.173
NEED FOR A HUNDRED AND FIFTY

01:59:41.240 --> 01:59:43.776
YEARS AGO WE WE SEE THAT WE

01:59:43.843 --> 01:59:45.511
MIGHT NOT NEED AT THIS POINT.

01:59:45.578 --> 01:59:48.447
BECAUSE ESPECIALLY GIVEN THAT

01:59:48.514 --> 01:59:50.383
MOST OF THE CORE FUNCTIONS HAVE

01:59:50.449 --> 01:59:51.484
BEEN TAKEN AWAY.

01:59:51.551 --> 01:59:53.486
THAT OF WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT

01:59:53.553 --> 01:59:56.322
HOW TO BETTER MAKE SURE THAT FTP

01:59:56.389 --> 01:59:57.924
OR OTHER AGENCIES HAVE THE

01:59:57.990 --> 02:00:00.159
RESOURCES THEY NEED HOW WE MIGHT

02:00:00.226 --> 02:00:01.460
NEED TO CHANGE.

02:00:01.527 --> 02:00:03.195
THE WAY THEY CURRENTLY DO THINGS

02:00:03.262 --> 02:00:04.564
SO THAT THESE ISSUES ARE BETTER

02:00:04.630 --> 02:00:05.765
ADDRESSED.

02:00:05.831 --> 02:00:07.667
RATHER THAN TRY TO HAVE SO MANY

02:00:07.733 --> 02:00:09.969
DIFFERENT OFFICES.

02:00:10.036 --> 02:00:11.938
EACH ONE POINTING FINGERS.

02:00:12.004 --> 02:00:13.773
I THINK I THINK THAT'S BEEN ALL

02:00:13.839 --> 02:00:15.641
OF OUR STRUGGLE I KNOW AS CHAIR

02:00:15.708 --> 02:00:18.077
OF AGING AND LONG TERM CARE

02:00:18.144 --> 02:00:19.612
THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO IN

02:00:19.679 --> 02:00:20.646
THAT SPACE.

02:00:20.713 --> 02:00:21.948
IS THAT AREA SEEMS TO HALL HAVE

02:00:22.014 --> 02:00:23.349
BEEN DECIDED UPON BASED ON

02:00:23.416 --> 02:00:25.117
DEFAULT RATHER THAN THERE BEING

02:00:25.184 --> 02:00:26.586
A PLAN.

02:00:26.652 --> 02:00:28.354
AND AND I FEEL LIKE THIS IS BEEN

02:00:28.421 --> 02:00:30.456
SOMEWHAT.

02:00:30.523 --> 02:00:32.558
QUICKLY AT A QUICKLY BUT THIS IS

02:00:32.625 --> 02:00:34.660
BEEN AN AREA WHERE INSTEAD OF

02:00:34.727 --> 02:00:35.728
HAVING ONE PLACE.

02:00:35.795 --> 02:00:37.530
UP WE'VE HAD MULTIPLE AND AND

02:00:37.597 --> 02:00:39.732
IT'S DISSEMINATED OUR ABILITY TO

02:00:39.799 --> 02:00:42.602
ACTUALLY BE EFFECTIVE SO.

02:00:42.668 --> 02:00:44.337
VERY LONG ABOUT ANSWER BUT BUT I

02:00:44.403 --> 02:00:46.072
HOPE BY ADDRESSED SEVERAL ISSUES

02:00:46.138 --> 02:00:48.674
IN. ONE ONE RESPONSE.

02:00:48.741 --> 02:00:50.443
AND IF I DID AND I'M HAPPY TO

02:00:50.509 --> 02:00:52.712
AND THEN MY MANAGER IF IT'S OKAY

02:00:52.778 --> 02:00:54.547
ONE FOR ONE FINAL QUESTION IN IN

02:00:54.614 --> 02:00:56.549
REGARDS TO TIMING ON THIS IF THE

02:00:56.616 --> 02:00:59.452
ACA'S MOVING MOVING FORWARD.

02:00:59.518 --> 02:01:00.553
AND THAT'S GOING TO GO BEFORE

02:01:00.620 --> 02:01:02.421
THE VOTERS IS IT NECESSARY TO

02:01:02.488 --> 02:01:05.257
HAVE -- THIS LANGUAGE -- MOVE IN

02:01:05.324 --> 02:01:08.828
IN THIS -- THIS YEAR OR WOULD

02:01:08.894 --> 02:01:10.229
TELL ME TO TALK ABOUT THAT OR

02:01:10.296 --> 02:01:12.565
CAN WE WAIT UNTIL AFTER THAT

02:01:12.632 --> 02:01:14.367
CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT IS IS

02:01:14.433 --> 02:01:16.068
ADOPTED BY THE VOTERS TO BE ABLE.

02:01:16.135 --> 02:01:17.737
TO IMPLEMENT SOMETHING SO THANK

02:01:17.803 --> 02:01:19.205
YOU FOR THE QUESTION THE AC

02:01:19.271 --> 02:01:20.906
DOESN'T HAVE A TIME LINE

02:01:20.973 --> 02:01:21.574
NECESSARILY.

02:01:21.641 --> 02:01:23.009
THAT THEN AND THAT'S WHY ONCE IT

02:01:23.075 --> 02:01:25.244
GETS REFERRED TO A COMMITTEE AND

02:01:25.311 --> 02:01:26.312
AND IT WASN'T REFERRED AND YET

02:01:26.379 --> 02:01:28.814
BECAUSE OF THE COMPETING BILLS

02:01:28.881 --> 02:01:31.050
HAVING TO DO WITH FISCAL RELATED

02:01:31.117 --> 02:01:31.283
ISSUES.

02:01:31.350 --> 02:01:33.786
SO ONCE THAT'S VOTED OUT AT THAT

02:01:33.853 --> 02:01:35.621
POINT WE CAN DISCUSS THE MERITS

02:01:35.688 --> 02:01:37.623
OF THAT ISSUE FOR AS LONG AS WE

02:01:37.690 --> 02:01:38.958
WANT WE CAN PUSH IT.

02:01:39.025 --> 02:01:40.459
INTO NEXT YEAR AS WELL.

02:01:40.526 --> 02:01:44.296
BUT BECAUSE OF THIS BILL HAVING --

02:01:44.363 --> 02:01:45.731
TIMELINES INSERT SPECIFIC

02:01:45.798 --> 02:01:47.800
DEADLINES ASSOCIATED WITH POLICY

02:01:47.867 --> 02:01:52.371

WE AYE THIS AYE AYE WE PRESENTED

02:01:53.739 --> 02:01:54.674
IT THIS YEAR SO THAT IT MOVES

02:01:54.740 --> 02:01:56.409
FORWARD -- AND AT SOME POINT WE

02:01:56.475 --> 02:01:59.211
CAN ADDRESS THE THE MAIN ISSUES

02:01:59.278 --> 02:02:03.115
AND OBJECTIVES THROUGH THE ACA --

02:02:03.182 --> 02:02:06.118
THAT'S ONE OF AND I HOPE BY.

02:02:06.185 --> 02:02:07.286
RESPOND AT THE HEART OF THE

02:02:07.353 --> 02:02:08.454
ISSUE OF WHAT YOU'RE TALKING

02:02:08.521 --> 02:02:09.922
ABOUT I DON'T WANT TO GO ON TOO

02:02:09.989 --> 02:02:12.992
LONG.

02:02:13.059 --> 02:02:15.861
SO IN A ROOM.

02:02:15.928 --> 02:02:17.963
ONE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR SO.

02:02:18.030 --> 02:02:19.532
ASSEMBLY MAN I MISSED THE VERY

02:02:19.598 --> 02:02:20.666
BEGINNING OF THE PRESENTATION

02:02:20.733 --> 02:02:21.801
DID YOU AGREE TO TAKE THE

02:02:21.867 --> 02:02:22.935
AMENDMENT.

02:02:23.002 --> 02:02:26.138
SO -- IF THE AC OR TO PASS IT

02:02:26.205 --> 02:02:27.206
DOESN'T AFFECT THE CURRENT

02:02:27.273 --> 02:02:29.542
COMPOSITION OF THE BOARD THAT

02:02:29.608 --> 02:02:32.745
THE EFFECTIVE DATE WOULD BE.

02:02:32.812 --> 02:02:33.579
TWENTY TWENTY TWO IF THE ACA

02:02:33.646 --> 02:02:35.614
WERE TO PASS OR WOULD IT TAKE

02:02:35.681 --> 02:02:40.052
EFFECT IMMEDIATELY UPON PASSAGE --

02:02:40.119 --> 02:02:40.953
I DON'T WE CAN'T BUY PASSED THE

02:02:41.020 --> 02:02:42.688
ACA SO THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE

02:02:42.755 --> 02:02:44.390
TAKEN UP IN THE ACA WHICH RIGHT

02:02:44.457 --> 02:02:45.524
A LOT WILL BE JUST.

02:02:45.591 --> 02:02:45.991
THERE'S GOING TO BE A

02:02:46.058 --> 02:02:48.394
STAKEHOLDER PROCESS FOR THE ACA

02:02:48.461 --> 02:02:49.662
WE'VE ALREADY DISCUSSED YES THE

02:02:49.729 --> 02:02:51.130
AUTHOR THAT THAT THAT.

02:02:51.197 --> 02:02:53.833
THAT THOSE KIND OF CONVERSATIONS

02:02:53.899 --> 02:02:55.367
THERE THERE WILL BE A MUCH MORE

02:02:55.434 --> 02:02:57.169
IN DEPTH CONVERSATION WITH ALL

02:02:57.236 --> 02:02:58.871
STAKEHOLDERS ON THE ACTUAL ACA

02:02:58.938 --> 02:03:00.639
WHICH THAT NEEDS TO BE A PORTION

02:03:00.706 --> 02:03:02.975
OF THE ACTUAL HCA OKAY NOT THIS

02:03:03.042 --> 02:03:04.844
PARTICULAR PORTION NOT THIS

02:03:04.910 --> 02:03:07.913
COMPANION NOW OKAY.

02:03:07.980 --> 02:03:08.414
THIS -- JUST HONESTLY.

02:03:08.481 --> 02:03:09.715
AS HARD AS IT IS TO SEPARATE

02:03:09.782 --> 02:03:11.584
THIS IS JUST A BASIC STRUCTURE

02:03:11.650 --> 02:03:17.022
IF THE ACA IS TO MOVE ALL THE

02:03:17.089 --> 02:03:18.190
WAY THROUGH THE PROCESS.

02:03:18.257 --> 02:03:19.759
SO I TOLD THE SETTLEMENT --

02:03:19.825 --> 02:03:20.559
EARLIER TODAY I AM UNDECIDED ON

02:03:20.626 --> 02:03:21.794
THE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION OF

02:03:21.861 --> 02:03:22.695
WHETHER NOT TO ELIMINATE THE

02:03:22.762 --> 02:03:24.930
BOARD I'M STILL FEELING MY WAY

02:03:24.997 --> 02:03:26.732
THROUGH THAT GIVEN THAT WE'VE.

02:03:26.799 --> 02:03:28.768
WE'RE JUST COMING OFF OF A MAJOR

02:03:28.834 --> 02:03:31.871
RESTRUCTURING OF THE B. O. E..

02:03:31.937 --> 02:03:33.606
AND THE FUNCTIONS OF THE BE -- A

02:03:33.672 --> 02:03:34.607
LOT DO WE EVEN KNOW WITH THE

02:03:34.673 --> 02:03:36.108
EFFICACY OF THOSE CHANGES WHILE

02:03:36.175 --> 02:03:38.844
WE'RE CONTEMPLATING ANOTHER

02:03:38.911 --> 02:03:41.280
CHANGE -- SO I DO HAVE SOME

02:03:41.347 --> 02:03:43.082
QUESTIONS JUST RUN TIMELINE IN

02:03:43.149 --> 02:03:44.116
PHASING.

02:03:44.183 --> 02:03:45.785
I'M GONNA LEAVE THE THE SORT OF

02:03:45.851 --> 02:03:49.221
ULTIMATE VOTE -- ON A SEE A AN

02:03:49.288 --> 02:03:51.657
OPEN QUESTION UNTIL WE HAVE SOME

02:03:51.724 --> 02:03:53.559
OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS.

02:03:53.626 --> 02:03:55.361
OF SO WANTED YOU. TO BE AWARE OF

02:03:55.427 --> 02:03:57.797
THAT -- I THINK WHAT'S GIVE ME A

02:03:57.863 --> 02:03:59.198
LITTLE BIT OF PAUSE IS ARE ARE

02:03:59.265 --> 02:04:00.499
SOME OF THE ARGUMENTS I'VE BEEN

02:04:00.566 --> 02:04:02.334
CONTACTED BY FOLKS ON BOTH SIDES

02:04:02.401 --> 02:04:04.303
OF THIS THIS IS GETTING GETTING

02:04:04.370 --> 02:04:05.204
QUITE A BIT OF ATTENTION.

02:04:05.271 --> 02:04:07.273
NOW AND AGAIN I DID SUPPORT THAT

02:04:07.339 --> 02:04:08.407
THAT RESTRUCTURING.

02:04:08.474 --> 02:04:10.476
AND AND THINK THIS IS A VALID

02:04:10.543 --> 02:04:12.945
CONVERSATION TO HAVE -- BUT DO

02:04:13.012 --> 02:04:14.780
WE ELIMINATE AN ELECTED BOARD --

02:04:14.847 --> 02:04:16.081
WHICH IS A CONDUIT FOR THE

02:04:16.148 --> 02:04:18.784
TAXPAYERS AT A TIME WHEN I HOPE

02:04:18.851 --> 02:04:21.153
WE ENGAGE IN A FULL FLEDGED

02:04:21.220 --> 02:04:24.056
CONVERSATION AROUND TAX REFORM.

02:04:24.123 --> 02:04:25.991
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE'VE

02:04:26.058 --> 02:04:28.027
GOT A HIGHLY VOLATILE -- TAX

02:04:28.093 --> 02:04:28.894
STRUCTURE.

02:04:28.961 --> 02:04:30.196
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A

02:04:30.262 --> 02:04:31.630
PROPOSITION THIRTEEN CORPORATE

02:04:31.697 --> 02:04:33.632
LOOPHOLE CHANGE ON THE TWENTY

02:04:33.699 --> 02:04:35.434
TWENTY BALLOT WHICH I HOPE WILL

02:04:35.501 --> 02:04:37.670
ENCOURAGE A LARGER CONVERSATION

02:04:37.736 --> 02:04:39.138
AROUND THE WAY WE DO TAXES IN

02:04:39.205 --> 02:04:39.972
CALIFORNIA.

02:04:40.039 --> 02:04:42.308
SO -- I'M LOOKING AT THIS ISSUE

02:04:42.374 --> 02:04:44.210
IN THE BROADER CONTEXT OF HOW

02:04:44.276 --> 02:04:45.778
ALL OF THESE THINGS.

02:04:45.845 --> 02:04:47.346
WORK TOGETHER.

02:04:47.413 --> 02:04:49.148
OR COMING UP WITH A STRUCTURE

02:04:49.215 --> 02:04:53.285
THAT MAKES THE MOST SENSE SO

02:04:53.352 --> 02:04:54.186
THAT.

02:04:54.253 --> 02:04:55.654
THE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION I'M I'M

02:04:55.721 --> 02:04:56.488
STILL GRAPPLING WITH BUT AS FAR

02:04:56.555 --> 02:04:57.656

TODAY TO KEEP THIS CONVERSATION

02:04:59.758 --> 02:05:01.560
GOING IN LIGHT OF THE FACT THAT

02:05:01.627 --> 02:05:02.061
THERE WILL BE ADDITIONAL

02:05:02.127 --> 02:05:02.761
STAKEHOLDER.

02:05:02.828 --> 02:05:04.396
A CONVERSATIONS ALL SUPPORT THE

02:05:04.463 --> 02:05:05.164

YOU PRIMARILY ABOUT HOW THIS

02:05:10.669 --> 02:05:11.337

TAX REFORM AND HOW WE MODERNIZE

02:05:19.211 --> 02:05:21.247
THE WAY WE DO ALL OF THIS.

02:05:21.313 --> 02:05:22.448
AND I'M STILL TRYING TO FIGURE

02:05:22.514 --> 02:05:25.317

ONE WE NEED TO HAVE.

02:05:29.922 --> 02:05:32.091
I DO HOWEVER THINK WE ALSO NEED

02:05:32.157 --> 02:05:35.461
TO LOOK AT THE TIMELINE ISSUES

02:05:35.527 --> 02:05:37.062
THE BALLOT SCHEDULE.

02:05:37.129 --> 02:05:38.631

02:07:51.397 --> 02:07:52.631
IT FRUSTRATES ME MORE THAN TO BE

02:07:52.698 --> 02:07:54.666
AND YOU KNOW LAST POLICY

02:07:54.733 --> 02:07:56.502
COMMITTEE OF THE SECOND HOUSE

02:07:56.568 --> 02:07:57.903
AND HAVE SOMEONE SAY -- IT'S A

02:07:57.970 --> 02:08:00.406

AND TOO OFTEN WE HEAR THAT RIGHT

02:08:02.141 --> 02:08:03.642
WHERE WE FIND OURSELVES IN THE

02:08:03.709 --> 02:08:04.977
FIRST CALL SEE COMMITTEE OF THE

A TWO YEAR SESSION.

02:08:08.113 --> 02:08:10.482
WITH AN ACA THAT WOULD BE SET TO

02:08:10.549 --> 02:08:13.018
BE ON THE BALLOT.

02:08:13.085 --> 02:08:15.721
IN A COUPLE YEARS RIGHT -- SO I

02:08:15.788 --> 02:08:17.089

02:08:18.357 --> 02:08:19.958

CONVINCED THAT WE HAVEN'T GONE

02:08:27.099 --> 02:08:28.801
TOO FAR IN THE DIRECTION OF

02:08:28.867 --> 02:08:30.636
BUREAUCRACY AND MAY WE NEED TECH

02:08:30.702 --> 02:08:32.137

STATE RUN AROUND -- AGENCIES

02:08:40.145 --> 02:08:41.647
THAT THOSE OF US WHO WORK HERE

02:08:41.713 --> 02:08:44.216
EVERYDAY CAN'T NAVIGATE.

02:08:44.283 --> 02:08:45.417
YOU KNOW WE GO WORK IN OUR

02:08:45.484 --> 02:08:47.219

CONSTITUENTS NOW TO GET SOME OF

02:08:48.520 --> 02:08:51.824
THESE -- PROCESS AND THAT CAN BE --

02:08:51.890 --> 02:08:53.592
INCREDIBLY FRUSTRATING

02:08:53.659 --> 02:08:56.361
EXPERIENCE. FOR US -- AND

02:08:56.428 --> 02:08:57.529
PROMOTION FOR THEIR CONSTITUENTS

02:08:57.596 --> 02:08:59.565

02:08:59.631 --> 02:09:01.166
OFF THIS BILL TODAY -- BUT I'M

02:09:01.233 --> 02:09:03.869
GOING TO CONTINUE -- ENGAGING

02:09:03.936 --> 02:09:06.071
WITH THE AUTHOR AND AND HOPE THE

02:09:06.138 --> 02:09:08.006
AUTHOR EMBRACES A DISCUSSION

02:09:08.073 --> 02:09:13.846
ABOUT HER PRIVATE SOMETHING THAT --

02:09:13.912 --> 02:09:14.580

I KNOW WE'VE HAD SOME.

02:09:16.381 --> 02:09:18.083
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THIS AS WELL

02:09:18.150 --> 02:09:20.953
AND AND I THINK FOR THE MOST

02:09:21.019 --> 02:09:23.655
PART WE AGREE -- AND HAVING HAD

02:09:23.722 --> 02:09:25.657
THE BENEFIT OF BEING STAFFERS IN

02:09:25.724 --> 02:09:28.794
THIS INSTITUTION AND SEEN HOW

02:09:28.861 --> 02:09:30.429
DIFFICULT SOME CHANGES HAVE BEEN --

02:09:30.496 --> 02:09:32.998

HAVE MENTIONED TO YOU I HAD

02:09:47.079 --> 02:09:49.348
ASKED LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL TO

DRAFT.

02:09:50.916 --> 02:09:52.184
THIS BILL LAST YEAR.

02:09:52.251 --> 02:09:53.919
THE ONLY REASON I DECIDED NOT TO

02:09:53.986 --> 02:09:55.187
INTRODUCE IT WAS BECAUSE I

02:09:55.254 --> 02:09:57.589
DIDN'T WANT TO SEEM LIKE THERE

02:09:57.656 --> 02:09:59.324
WAS SOMETHING BEING BRUSHED.

02:09:59.391 --> 02:10:00.626
I THOUGHT LET ME INTRODUCE AT

02:10:00.692 --> 02:10:03.262
THE BEGINNING OF A START OF A

02:10:03.328 --> 02:10:03.462
TERM.

02:10:03.529 --> 02:10:05.464
SO THAT WE CAN.

HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO THAT THE

02:10:07.599 --> 02:10:09.268
ISSUE AND AND DISCUSS.

YEAH -- I THINK IT'S VERY

02:10:21.046 --> 02:10:22.981
IMPORTANT THAT THE VOTERS HAVE

02:10:23.048 --> 02:10:24.783
AN IDEA WHAT WILL HAPPEN.

02:10:24.850 --> 02:10:28.420
IF THE IF WE DO ABOLISH AND

02:10:28.487 --> 02:10:30.155
THAT'S GOING TO BE UP TO THEM

02:10:30.222 --> 02:10:31.490

THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION AND I

02:10:33.158 --> 02:10:35.294

02:10:35.360 --> 02:10:37.095
WAY TO DISCUSS THAT AND I'LL BE

02:10:37.162 --> 02:10:37.963
SUPPORTING THE BILL.

02:10:38.030 --> 02:10:39.665

ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS

02:10:40.866 --> 02:10:43.235
FROM THE COMMITTEE.

02:10:43.302 --> 02:10:46.405
SEEING NONE -- YES I AGREE WITH

02:10:46.471 --> 02:10:47.739
SOME OF MY FELLOW MEMBERS THAT

02:10:47.806 --> 02:10:49.074
TAX REFORM IN A MUCH LARGER

02:10:49.141 --> 02:10:50.609
CONTEXT AND MODERNIZATION OF OF

02:10:50.676 --> 02:10:52.744
OUR TAX CODE IS IMPERATIVE AND

02:10:52.811 --> 02:10:53.412
WE DO NEED TO HAVE A

02:10:53.478 --> 02:10:54.746
CONVERSATION AND IT IS A VERY

02:10:54.813 --> 02:10:56.882
CHALLENGING CONVERSATION AND

02:10:56.949 --> 02:10:58.483
THAT WILL TAKE YEARS AND ITSELF.

02:10:58.550 --> 02:11:00.686
HOWEVER -- AS THE REPRESENTATIVE

02:11:00.752 --> 02:11:02.254
THE BE A WE EMPLOYEES HAD

02:11:02.321 --> 02:11:04.089
MENTIONED THAT WHEN WE DID MAKE

02:11:04.156 --> 02:11:05.691
THE LAST CHANGE THEY WERE FORCED

02:11:05.757 --> 02:11:06.959
TO MOVE VERY QUICKLY.

02:11:07.025 --> 02:11:08.026
AND THERE WAS NO STRUCTURE IN

02:11:08.093 --> 02:11:09.595
PLACE WE DO NOT WANT THAT TO

02:11:09.661 --> 02:11:10.796
HAPPEN AGAIN.

02:11:10.862 --> 02:11:13.065
SO THIS THIS ITEM BEFORE US IS

02:11:13.131 --> 02:11:15.200
NOT THE ACA IT'S NOT A DECISION

02:11:15.267 --> 02:11:16.902

02:11:18.537 --> 02:11:20.105
HAPPENS.

02:11:20.172 --> 02:11:21.240
TO THE WAY WE PROCESS THESE

02:11:21.306 --> 02:11:23.075
THINGS MOVING FORWARD BUT IT IS

02:11:23.141 --> 02:11:24.476
JUST MAKING SURE THAT THE PEOPLE

02:11:24.543 --> 02:11:26.178
OF CALIFORNIA HAVE A STRUCTURE

02:11:26.245 --> 02:11:27.879
IN THE EVENT THAT THEY MAKE A

02:11:27.946 --> 02:11:29.314
DECISION.

02:11:29.381 --> 02:11:31.149
THE ACA TO TO VOTE ON A CA.

02:11:31.216 --> 02:11:32.384

02:48:06.009 --> 02:48:06.876
THAN PROPOSITION THIRTEEN THE

02:48:06.943 --> 02:48:07.844
NUMBER ONE ISSUE REGARDING CALLS

02:48:07.911 --> 02:48:09.212
THAT WE GET TO OUR OFFICE IS ON

02:48:09.279 --> 02:48:10.413
THE PROPERTY TAX PROS FROM A

02:48:10.480 --> 02:48:11.247
PROGRAM.

02:48:11.314 --> 02:48:12.615
IT'S INCREDIBLY VALUABLE

02:48:12.682 --> 02:48:14.884
VALUABLE FIRST SENIOR MEMBERS.

02:48:14.951 --> 02:48:16.519
AND IT KEEPS INDIVIDUALS IN

02:48:16.586 --> 02:48:18.388
THEIR HOMES AND I THINK AS

02:48:18.455 --> 02:48:20.056
SOMEONE AND AS PART OF AN

02:48:20.123 --> 02:48:21.324
ORGANIZATION THAT SUPPORTED THE

02:48:21.391 --> 02:48:22.759
AMERICAN DREAM OVER THE YEARS

02:48:22.826 --> 02:48:24.928
THAT'S HIGHLY HIGHLY VALUABLE --

02:48:24.994 --> 02:48:26.262
SO FOR ALL THESE REASONS AND

02:48:26.329 --> 02:48:28.097
ESPECIALLY WE ARE DEFINITELY IN

02:48:28.164 --> 02:48:29.399
FAVOR OF THE LOWER INTEREST RATE

02:48:29.466 --> 02:48:31.201
AND WANTING TO SEE THAT -- IN

02:48:31.267 --> 02:48:32.802
ORDER TO ENCOURAGE GREATER

02:48:32.869 --> 02:48:34.137
ENROLLMENT IN THE PROGRAM WOULD

02:48:34.204 --> 02:48:36.506
ASK FOR AND I HAVE A THANK YOU

02:48:36.573 --> 02:48:38.041
INITIAL SUPPORTERS.

02:48:38.107 --> 02:48:38.541
SEEING NONE WITNESSES IN

02:48:38.608 --> 02:48:39.576
OPPOSITION.

02:48:39.642 --> 02:48:40.944
SEEING NONE BRING IT BACK TO THE

02:48:41.010 --> 02:48:42.312
COMMITTEE MEMBERS WISHING TO ASK

02:48:42.378 --> 02:48:43.813
ANY QUESTIONS QUIRK.

02:48:43.880 --> 02:48:46.282
YEAH -- ALL RIGHT MY PROBLEM IS

02:48:46.349 --> 02:48:47.784
THAT IF YOU KEEP THE INTEREST

02:48:47.851 --> 02:48:49.319
RATE THIS LOW IT'LL DESTROY THE

02:48:49.385 --> 02:48:52.088
PROGRAM AT LEAST THAT'S THAT'S

02:48:52.155 --> 02:48:56.559
MY READING FROM THE LA A REPORT.

02:48:56.626 --> 02:48:57.694
WHICH SUGGESTS 5%.

02:48:57.760 --> 02:48:58.528
ARM I COULD VOTE FOR THIS IF YOU

02:48:58.595 --> 02:48:59.963
WOULD.

02:49:00.029 --> 02:49:01.998
TAKE THE LA -- SUGGESTION AND

02:49:02.065 --> 02:49:04.467
EITHER MAKE IT 5% OR MAKE IT A

02:49:04.534 --> 02:49:05.201
FLOATING RATE.

02:49:05.268 --> 02:49:08.238
BUT SETTING IT EXACTLY AT THE

02:49:08.304 --> 02:49:10.139
PMR HIGH A RATE.

02:49:10.206 --> 02:49:11.674
YOU'RE NOT EVEN MAKING UP FOR

02:49:11.741 --> 02:49:12.976
INFLATION.

02:49:13.042 --> 02:49:14.911
I COULD ACCEPT SOMETHING LIKE PM

02:49:14.978 --> 02:49:17.680
MY A PLUS INFLATION OR SOMETHING

02:49:17.747 --> 02:49:20.583
ELSE BUT MY CONCERN IS THAT THAT

02:49:20.650 --> 02:49:22.685
THIS WILL DESTROY THE PROGRAM

02:49:22.752 --> 02:49:24.120
IT'LL NO LONGER BE SELF FUNDING.

02:49:24.187 --> 02:49:27.190

02:49:27.257 --> 02:49:29.859
WELL IT IF THE LA -- WANTS -- TO

02:49:29.926 --> 02:49:31.261

02:49:32.529 --> 02:49:34.230
QUESTION I I WOULD I WOULD

02:49:37.066 --> 02:49:38.001
WOULD.

02:49:38.067 --> 02:49:40.803
THE BILL ENJOYS SUPPORT SUPPORT

02:49:40.870 --> 02:49:42.205
