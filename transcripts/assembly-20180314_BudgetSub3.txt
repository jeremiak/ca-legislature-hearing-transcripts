SORRY TO KEEP YOU WAITING BUT TO HAVE WE HAVE A VERY BUSY AGENDA TODAY. TO WERE STARTING A BIT LATE. VIA PROBABLY HAVING TO TRUNCATE. OF A PUBLIC COMMENT TAG AND. ON ON A COUPLE OF THE BIG ISSUES. SO FOR THOSE OF YOU ARE PREPARED TO MAKE LONG STATEMENTS WERE PROBABLY GONNA HAVE TO JUST IN THE INTEREST OF TIME ASK YOU TO. STATE TO WHO YOU ARE WHO YOU REPRESENT INTO WHETHER YOU SUPPORTER OPPOSE WHAT IS IS PROPOSED. AND I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT BECAUSE WE NORMALLY LIKE TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO A BUG AND EXPRESS THEMSELVES A LITTLE MORE FULLY. WE'RE TO BEGIN WITH A ISSUE ONE THE. AND WILL TAKE ROLE WHEN WE HAVE A THIRD MEMBER GET HERE BUT. FOR NOW WILL LACK OF BEGIN WITH PRESENTATIONS AND STARTING WITH ISSUE ONE THE. SP FIVE. BCP'S WILL BE GIVEN WITH VIA LA GO AND ASK THAT YOU PROVIDE US WITH A. BRIEF AND GENERAL OVERVIEW OF FOR THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED EXPENDITURES AND YOUR COMMENTS. ANSWER TRAILER WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME FORWARD. I STARTED. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. MISTER FONG. BRYAN BROWN WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE I JUST VERY BRIEFLY FROM THE BACKGROUND I KNOW THIS IS THE. ISSUE THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS ALREADY FAMILIAR WITH LAST YEAR THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED FE FIVE. WHICH BUT APPROVED FOUR POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL OBLIGATION BONDS. EMPLOYEES THAT MEASURE ON THE JUNE BALLOT IT WOULD PROVIDE THAT FUNDING FOR A VARIETY OF RESOURCE RELATED PURPOSES. AND AFFECTING YOUR GEN ON PAGE FIVE YOU CAN SEE A SUMMARY OF THE BOND. AND YOU'LL SEE THAT THAT FUNDING GOES FOR A VARIETY OF PURPOSES ON STATE LOCAL PARK HABITAT RESTORATION AND FLOOD PROTECTION PROJECTS AND OTHER WATER RELATED PROJECT IN PARTICULAR. ON THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES ONE BILLION DOLLARS TO ONE QUARTER THE TOTAL FUNDING AUTHORIZED IN S. B. FIVE. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN THIS FUNDING IS SPREAD ACROSS EIGHTEEN APARTMENTS IN ROUGHLY THIRTY DIFFERENT BUDGET PROPOSALS AND THOSE ARE SUMMARIZED ON PAGES TWO THROUGH FOUR OF YOUR COMMITTEE AGENDA. I THAT ONE BILLION DOLLARS THAT ABOUT EIGHTY PERCENT IF FOR LOCAL ASSISTANCE SO THAT FOR GRANT PRIMARILY TO NONPROFITS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO IMPLEMENT DIFFERENT PROJECTS. AND MORE THAN HALF OF THAT LOCAL ASSIST IN FINDING IS FOR LOCAL PARKS PROJECTS. OTHERS ALSO INCLUDED IN THEIR ONE HUNDRED TWENTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN STATE CAPITAL OUTLAY PROJECTS THAT INCLUDES NINETY FOUR MILLION FOR FLOOD PROTECTION PROJECTS. IN TWENTY FOUR MILLION FOR THE SOLVENCY RESTORATION WORK. IN LESS THAN FIVE PERCENT OF THE FUNDING PROPOSED FOR STATE OPERATIONS ENOUGH MOSTLY TO EITHER DEVELOP GUIDELINES FOR PROGRAMS THAT GRANT GUIDELINES. OR TO DO OTHER SORT OF GRANT ADMINISTRATION AND OVERSIGHT WORK. SO WITH THAT A SHORT OVERVIEW OUR OFFICE DID HAVE FOUR COMMENTS FOR THE COMMITTEE AND REVIEWING THE THE PLAN. FIRST OF WHICH IS THAT WE THINK OVERALL THE ADMINISTRATION'S PLAN IS VERY REASONABLE AND ITS APPROACH TO WHAT IT PROPOSES DEFINED IN THE BUDGET YEAR. WE NOTE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION AND TARGETS THE PROJECT FUNDING AT PROGRAMS WHERE THEY CAN REASONABLY BE EXPECTED TO GET FINDING OUT FOR PROJECT IN THE BUDGET YEAR. IN MOST CASES THAT'S WHERE THEY'RE BUILDING ON THE ALREADY EXISTING PROGRAMS ARE RECENTLY ACTIVE PROGRAM SO. UPDATING GUIDELINES SHOULD BE A RELATIVELY STRAIGHTFORWARD PROCESS AND CAN REASONABLY BE EXPECTED BE DONE IN THE BUDGET YEAR AND AND GRANTS AWARDED BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR. AND FOR NEW PROGRAMS AT THE MINISTRATION IS TYPICALLY ONLY REQUESTING FUNDING FOR THE FATE OPERATIONS SO THAT WOULD BE THE PERSONNEL THAT'S VERY TO DEVELOP THOSE GUIDELINES FOR NEW PROGRAMS. KNOWING THAT AWARD PROBABLY WOULD HAPPEN UNTIL SUBSEQUENT YEARS AND WE THINK THAT'S A REASONABLE APPROACH. A DIFFERENT ADMINISTRATION IS HAVE GENERALLY FOCUSED ITS. FUNDING ON PROGRAMS WHERE THERE'S NOT EXISTING. PREVIOUSLY APPROVED BOND FUNDING AVAILABLE AND SO. AND AND WE THINK THAT'S A REASONABLE APPROACH IS OVERALL WE RECOMMEND APPROVAL OF THE PRO PROPOSALS. WITH A COUPLE MINOR. CHANGES THAT WOULD RECOMMEND WHICH I MENTIONED JUST A MOMENT ANEST ASSUMING OF COURSE THAT FD FIVE DON'T PASSED IN JUNE. SO THOSE COUPLE OF CHANGES WERE RECOMMENDING WE THINK THE RATHER MODEST BUT. THE FIRST OF WHICH IS TO SCHEDULE HOW THE PROJECT THAT WOULD BE FINE DID. WITHIN NINETY FOUR MILLION FOR FLOOD PROTECTION PROJECT. IF YOU CERTAINLY KNOW THEIR BILLIONS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF FLOOD PROTECTION PROJECT POTENTIALLY. IN IN NEED ACROSS THE STATE. V. ADMINISTRATION PROPOSAL DOESN'T IDENTIFY WHICH SPECIFIC PROJECTS WOULD BE FUNDED WITH THIS NINETY FOUR MILLION BUT WE THINK THERE COUPLE ADVANTAGES OF SCHEDULING ABOUT IN THE BUDGET ACT. OWE IT WE WOULD TYPICALLY DO FROM US CAPITAL OUTLAY PROJECTS THE FIRST DAY IS OF COURSE TO ENSURE THAT THE PROJECT HAD A PRIORITIZE ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE LEGISLATORS LEGISLATURE'S PRIORITIES. AND SECONDLY WE THINK IT WOULD THAT ALLOW FOR SOME ADDITIONAL ACCOUNTABILITY THAT IF IF PROJECTS IDENTIFIED. IN THE FUTURE A NEED TO CHANGE EITHER IN SCOPE OR IN COST IF THE COST INCREASE. THE IMITATION BE REQUIRED TO COME BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE AND NOTIFY YOU OF THOSE CHANGES THAT WE THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT CAL AND ABILITY MEASURE. THEIR SECOND CHANGE WOULD RECOMMEND IS THERE'S ABOUT FOURTEEN MILLION DOLLARS IN DEPARTMENT FISH AND WILDLIFE BUDGET PROPOSAL THAT IF FOR VARIOUS HABITAT RESTORATION PROJECT. WE KNOW HOWEVER THERE IS OVER HUNDRED SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS CURRENTLY UNCOMMITTED FROM PROPOSITION ONE FOR SIMILAR TYPES OF ACTIVITIES. AND WE THINK IT MAKES SENSE TO US WHAT THAT FOURTEEN MILLION DOLLARS WHICH WE DON'T HAVE CONCERNED WITH THE ACTIVITIES PROPOSED. BUT TO FIND THAT OUT OF PROPOSITION ONE OUT OF THAT RATHER THAN S. B. FIVE. IDEA BEING THERE THAT THE. THE DEPARTMENT WOULD NEED TO RUN PARALLEL BOND ADMINISTRATION PROGRAMS FOR THOSE ACTIVITIES. UP TO OTHER COMMENTS WE HAD THE FIRST OF THE WE RECOMMEND THAT YOU HAVE THE ADMINISTRATION REPORT IT SUBCOMMITTEE HEARING THE FEAR ON THEIR LONGER TERM SPENDING PLAN. WE KNOW THAT THE ADMINISTRATION ONLY PURPOSE IDENTIFIES A SPENDING PLAN FOR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. CLEARLY THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAD A NUMBER OF OTHER ACTIVITIES AND PROGRAMS THAT WERE PRIORITIES TO YOU AND. HAVE YOU INCLUDED THEM ENOUGH B. FIVE AND WE WOULD THINK YOU. WOULD COULD BENEFIT FROM UNDERSTANDING WHAT HOW LONG THE MINISTRATION BELIEVE IT WILL TAKE TO GET THOSE OTHER DOLLARS. SPENT IN THOSE PROGRAMS AND PROJECTS IMPLEMENTED. AND LASTLY WE THINK YOU SHOULD USE THE A SUBCOMMITTEE PROCESS TO CONSIDER. ALTERNATIVES SHOULD S. B. FIVE ULTIMATELY FAIL. IN WITH VOTERS AND IN JAIL AND THAT THE ELECTION IS ON JUNE FIFTH JUST TEN DAYS BEFORE YOUR CONSTITUTIONAL DEADLINE TO PASS A BUDGET. WHICH DOESN'T LEAVE YOU MUCH TIME FOR THAT OCCUR. TO DEVELOP A BACK UP PLAN IN. WE THINK IN. THERE ALMOST CERTAINLY ACTIVITY THEM PROGRAMS PROPOSED IN THE ADMINISTRATION PLAN THAT PROBABLY A HIGH ENOUGH PRIORITY YOU WOULD WANT TO FIND IN THE BUDGET YEAR EVEN IN THE ABSENCE OF THE GENERAL OBLIGATION BONDS. A ONE EXAMPLE BEING THE SALTON SEA MANAGEMENT PLAN WHICH WE HAVE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS TO BEGIN IMPLEMENTING BUT THERE COULD BE OTHER PROGRAMMATIC PRIORITY IF YOU HAVE AS WELL. ANYONE IDENTIFY THOSE AS WELL AS WHAT FUNDING SOURCE IF YOU WOULD IDENTIFY TO USE. AND THAT COULD INCLUDE EVERYTHING FROM GENERAL FUND TO. CAP AND TRADE AUCTION REVENUES TO ELP HALF THE ENVIRONMENTAL LICENSE PLATE FIND A MUCH SMALLER FUNDING SOURCE. EACH OF THOSE COME WITH SOME A RESTRICTION ON HOW THEY CAN BE USED AND OF COURSE COME WITH A TRADE OFF OF. USING THOSE FUNDING FOR THESE TYPES OF PROJECTS WOULD LEAVE LEFT AVAILABLE FOR OTHER PRIORITIES YOU MIGHT HAVE. BUT IN IN. IN ANY CASE WE THINK THAT WOULD MAKE SENSE TO. HAVE SOME. OF THOSE PRIORITIES AND ALTERNATIVES IDENTIFIED IN ADVANCE OF JUNE FIFTH. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ARE DEPARTMENT FINANCE YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS. A JUST THAT UNION IN REGARDS TO SOME OF THE LA US OBSERVATIONS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION COURSE CONTINUES TO TRACK THE STATUS. THE EIGHT AND. AND YOU KNOW THAT BUDGET. DEVELOPMENT PROCESS AND WILL BE. YOU KNOW CONSIDERING A CASE BY CASE PROGRAM BACK FROM PROGRAM BASIS THE NEED TO YOU KNOW FUND THESE IF PROPOSITION. PASS AND THAT'S. YOU APPROACH THE ADMINISTRATION TAKING IN TERMS OF. THE PROPOSITION. SECRETARY LAIRD WELCOME IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN YOU'VE HAD A. BUSY YEAR AND TO. THESE ALLOCATION SURF THERE PROVED ARE GONNA KEEP YOU BUSY INTO THE NEXT YEAR. EXACTLY AND THANK YOU AND HOPEFULLY WE WON'T HAVE THE. A THE SAME FLOODS OF FIRES AND MUD SLIDES WE HAD THAT KEPT US BUSY THIS LAST YEAR. IT OF HER HOPEFULLY IT'LL COME DOWN I'M GONNA TAKE A THE ADMONITION A LITTLE SERIOUSLY FROM THE CHAIR THAT YOU HAVE A PACKED AGENDA. THING LA AND SINCE OR YOUR CONSIDERING TWENTY SIX DEPARTMENTS BOARDS COMMISSIONS CONSERVANCY CENTER PART OF THE. RESOURCES AGENCY WHAT I THOUGHT I DO IS JUST GIVE YOU A HIGH LEVEL. OF WHAT IS IN HERE AND AND SORT OF HOW IT FITS POLICY WISE AS YOU THEN MOVE INTO THE INDIVIDUAL UP. DEPARTMENTS. A CLIMATE RESILIENCY AN ADAPTATION IS STILL EVEN WHERE THE POINT. AS AN AGENCY AND THERE ARE MANY THINGS THAT ARE SORT OF VERY PRESCIENT AND AND VERY PRESENT. IN IT RIGHT NOW. OUR CLIMATE ADAPTATION STRATEGY THE UPDATE TO SAFEGUARDING WAS RELEASED. AND IS NOW BEING USED. OUR OUR SEA LEVEL RISE GUIDANCE OF WE ARE CONSIDERING THIS VERY AFTERNOON AT THE OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCIL TO APPROVE AND THEN. I HAVE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS LOOK AT. A WE WILL BE RELEASING THAT CALIFORNIA FORCE CARBON PLAN. SORT OF. SCIENTIFIC FOUNDATION AND POLICY VISION FOR THE RESILIENCY OF FORESTS. AND THEN IN BASING ACTIONS ON SCIENCE THE FOURTH. OUR ASSESSMENT WILK SHOULD COME OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE YEAR. WHICH IS A WHOLE COLLECTION OF SCIENTIFIC STUDIES THAT THEN. ARE A LOT OF THE ACTIONS CAN BE BASED ON. YOU ALREADY HAVE A LITTLE OF THE DISCUSSION ON. S. B. FIVE AND PROP AND PROPOSITION SIXTY EIGHT. THE BIG THINGS FOR US OF SOME OF THEM WERE MENTIONED THERE'S ALSO HEALTHY AND RESILIENT FOR US. A AGRICULTURE ENERGY OF A WELL THAT'S AND. IN CAP AND TRADE THERE'S A SAFE NEIGHBORHOOD PARKS OR CAPITA GRANTS FLOOD CONTROL THAT WAS MENTIONED. SIGMA HAVE ADAPTATION OF THE SALTON SEA RESTORATION AND I SHOULD MENTION. THAT. IS THAT WE HAD MONEY TO FUND THE SALTON SEA RESTORATION TO TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND WHAT'S IN THE BOND WILL PICK IT UP AND CARRY IT TO THE END OF WHAT THE LEGISLATURE. WHEN THEY ADOPTED. THE MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR THE SOLVENCY IT WILL CARRY IT THROUGH WHAT IS THE LIFE OF THAT MANAGEMENT PLAN IN THE PROJECTIONS FOR REST. A RESTORATION. AND THERE'S COSTA PROTECTION AND HABITAT RESTORATION AND I FEEL OBLIGATED TO JOIN IN THE CHORUS. OUR IT HASN'T PASSED YET. AND IF ANYBODY IS LISTENING AND. IF THEY HAVE A CONSCIENCE EITHER WAY THEY NEED TO ACT ON IT TO DECIDE THAT THESE WERE ONE FACT BE IN THE BUDGET ON. ON JUNE FIFTEENTH BECAUSE IT WILL BE IN FRONT OF THE VOTERS TEN DAYS BEFORE. WE DO HAVE CAP AND TRADE ARE STARTING MENTION HEALTHY RESILIENT FOREST'S. A AGRICULTURAL ENERGY EFFICIENCY ENERGY COR RENEWABLE ENERGY PROGRAM. AND. CAO FIRE. WE WORKED CLOSELY WITH THE LEGISLATURE LAST YEAR IN WHAT TURNED OUT. THE TO BE PREDICTIVE IN ONE WAY BECAUSE WE WANTED TO FINALLY MOVE. TO RECOGNIZING THE NEW NORMAL IN BUDGET FUNDING THE FIRE SEASON HAD EXPANDED ON BOTH BANDS OVER THE LAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS. WE ACTUALLY A ADJUSTED HOW THINGS ARE FUNDED AND THEN IT TURNED OUT THAT THAT'S EXACTLY. ABOUT THAT LONG FIRE SEASON HAPPENED IN THIS YEAR. AND THERE ARE MONEY IN HERE FOR THE FIRST OF A. SERIES OF HELICOPTER PROCUREMENT. I HAVE FOR VENTURA FIRE CAMP A FOR MCCLELLAN RELOAD SO THEIR THINGS HERE THAT ARE FOR CALIFORNIA. THERE IS DIDN'T I KNOW IT'LL BE DISCUSSED THERE'S. SUSTAINABLE FUNDING FOR FISH AND WILDLIFE AND IF YOU LOOK AT. THE DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS THAT DEPEND ON THE GENERAL FUND ALL TOOK A HIT. IN THE MELTDOWN OF TWO THOUSAND NINE. ACCOUNT FAR WORKED ITS WAY BACK. WITHOUT US SOME OF THE A PARKS FUNDING THAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE LAST. A YEAR PARKS HAS WORKED ITS WAY BACK. AND THIS IS THE ONE REMAINING ONE. THAT HAS NEVER REALLY COME BACK FROM THE CUTS. ABOUT A OF THE BUDGET. IN TWO THOUSAND NINE TEN ELEVEN. AND THIS PROPOSAL IS SUSTAINABLE ONGOING FUNDING FOR FISH AND WILDLIFE AND. AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO US. OF THE PARKS. IMPLEMENTING OF THAT ADDITIONAL FUNDING THEY'RE DEALING WITH THE NEW ENTITY THAT WOULD RAISE MONEY OUTSIDE A A NON PROFIT. OF THEY HAVE DEALT WITH THE PROMOTIONAL OPPORTUNITIES. WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT SO THAT EVERYBODY CAN PROMOTE WE ARE IMPLEMENTING THE LEGISLATURE'S ACT ON PARTNERSHIPS. NOW THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE LAST FEW YEARS WE ACTUALLY FUND BY INDIVIDUAL PARK SO WE COULD TELL YOU HOW MUCH AN INDIVIDUAL PARK COSTS. AND NOW THAT THERE ARE IS A FRAMEWORK FOR PARTNERS. TO SUPPORT THERE'S A TARGET THAT SET UP BECAUSE IT'S CLEAR WHAT THE INDIVIDUAL FUNDING IS AND A PARTNERSHIP BASIS. AND SO OR SOME OF THOSE THINGS THAT ARE HERE AND THEN LASTLY. AHA. THE WHOLE SAFETY OF DAMS OF THE GOVERNOR SIGNED A BILL. ARE A LITTLE EARLIER A IT IN THE YEAR WE ARE ALSO WORKING HARD ON.

WITH THAT WILL MOVE TO PUBLIC COMMENT. HAS ANYONE WHO WOULD LIKE TO BE HEARD ON THIS. PARTICULAR ITEM. STAYING NO ONE. WILL MOVE ON TO DEPARTMENT EFFICIENT WILDLIFE. WE'VE GOT. TWO ISSUES. SUSTAINABLE FUNDING. AND THE STATE WATER PROJECTS LOCAL DIRECTOR CALORIE. GOOD MORNING CHAIR ASSEMBLY MEMBERS STAFF. WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO BEGIN OR. LA AREA TO BEGIN WITH OKAY. SO MY NAME IS CHUCKBOTTOM I'M THE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE. AND. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. AND THE DEPARTMENT'S BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL. RESPOND TO ABOUT A SEVENTY YEAR OLD PROBLEM. THE DEPARTMENT'S PROPOSAL SEEKS IN ONGOING PERMANENT FIFTY POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS. NEW FOR THE DEPARTMENT. AND NINETY EIGHT POSITIONS. THERE A PURPOSE TO THIS PROPOSAL. IT'S TO FIX THAT SEVENTY YEAR OLD PROBLEM. SINCE ABOUT THE NINETEEN FIFTIES. THERE'S GENERAL CONSENSUS. OUR DEPARTMENT'S MAIN CHALLENGE IS TO STAND ABOVE FUNDING. IN FACT I HAVE A NINETEEN FIFTY EIGHT REPORT TO MY OFFICE. FROM BOOZ ALLEN HAMILTON A NATIONAL CONSULTING FIRM. COMMISSION BY THE LEGISLATURE'S JOINT. LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE IDENTIFYING THAT IS OUR MAIN CHALLENGE. THE TWO THOUSAND SIX. OUR STATE LEGISLATURE AMENDED OUR FISH AND GAME CODE. SECTION SEVEN TEN. TO ADD THIS LANGUAGE. QUOTE THE LEGISLATURE FINDS AND DECLARES THE DEPARTMENT CONTINUES TO BE AN ADEQUATELY FUNDED. THE DEPARTMENT MUST SECURE SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN RELIABLE FUNDING. THERE'S ALSO A NEED. FOR THIS PROPOSAL. YOUR OWN STAFF ANNOUNCES TODAY ON PAGE TWENTY ONE SAYS QUOTE. ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR DFW IS LONG OVERDUE. THERE'S BEEN A WHOLE HECK OF A LOT OF PROCESS. SINCE I'VE BEEN DIRECTOR. AB TWENTY THREE SEVENTY SIX IN TWO THOUSAND TEN CONVENE A BLUE RIBBON PANEL PROCESS AND STAKEHOLDER DRIVEN VISION EFFORT. THINK ABOUT REFORM FOR OUR DEPARTMENT. IT PRODUCED A REPORT IN TWO THOUSAND TEN WITH TWENTY EIGHT RECOMMENDATIONS. FOR AT LEAST THE LAST TWO BUDGET CYCLES I PERSONALLY IN THE DEPARTMENT INSTITUTIONALLY HAVE BEEN PRETTY TRANSPARENT. ABOUT A PROJECTED IMBALANCE IN OUR MAIN FUND. THE FISHING GAME PRESERVATION FUND. OVER THIS TIMEFRAME WE'VE. SAW AND SECURED AT LEAST A SUBSTANTIAL FEE INCREASES IN CERTAIN SECTORS INCLUDING LAST YEAR WHICH WAS PARTICULARLY PAINFUL. AS MANY WILL REMEMBER ABOUT A COMMERCIAL FISHING FEE INCREASE. ALL TO ILLUSTRATE THIS PROBLEM. THE BUDGET ACT OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. GAVE US THREE NEW INSTRUCTIONS. FIRST WE WERE TO GET THE BAND BACK TOGETHER. SO WE RECONVENE THE STAKEHOLDER VISION PROCESS GROUP. THE SECOND MOST RECENT STRUCTURE WAS TO GIVE YOU A PROGRESS REPORT. BENCHMARKED AGAINST THE TWO THOUSAND AND TEN TWENTY EIGHT RECOMMENDATIONS. WE SUBMITTED THAT IN OCTOBER OF LAST YEAR. AND THE THIRD INSTRUCTION WAS TO BASICALLY HIGHER THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND ENGAGE IN A MISSION BASED BUDGETING PROCESS. I SUPPORT THAT PROCESS COMPLETELY. IT ACTUALLY SHAPED THE PROPOSAL FOR FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS. THERE'S ALSO BEEN A WHOLE HECK OF A LOT OF STAKEHOLDER SUPPORT. IT'S RARE. THAT THE DEPARTMENTS FAR LEFT CONSTITUENCY AND FAR RIGHT CONSTITUENCY. WILL ALIGN. THE ORIGINAL STAKEHOLDER PROCESS WAS NONPARTISAN. THE MOST RECENT CONVERSATION WAS BIPARTISAN. AND I THINK YOU SEE A DIVERSITY OF GROUPS IS SUPPORT THIS FIFTY POINT SIX MILLION. HERE'S WHAT WE DO WITH IT. WE TAKE NINETEEN POINT SIX MILLION. AND WE'D FIX THE IMBALANCE BEFORE IT REALLY COMES DO. THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO AVOID CUTTING CRITICAL WORK. AND WE TAKE ABOUT THIRTY ONE MILLION. AND WE ENHANCE OUR CONSERVATION EFFORTS. ATTACHED OF THIS PROPOSAL IS AN EXPENDITURE CONCEPT TO INVEST IN NATURAL HERITAGE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. IT WAS DESIGNED BY THOSE STAKEHOLDERS. IT'S GOT FOUR ASPECTS. THIS FIFTY MILLION WILL HELP US ENHANCE CONSERVATION. IT'S GOING TO BENEFIT ALL CALIFORNIANS. IT WILL BENEFIT HUNTERS AND ANGLERS IF YOU'RE CALIFORNIAN YOU LIKE THOSE RECREATIONAL PURSUITS. WE WILL INVEST IN PROGRAMS TO RECRUIT RETAIN REACTIVATE HUNTERS AND ANGLERS. WILL INVEST IN OUR HATCHERY PROGRAMS. AND QUITE FRANKLY THIS WILL REDUCE THE RISK THAT I'M FORCED TO RAISE THE FEES AGAIN ON HUNTERS AND ANGLERS IN THE STATE. FOURTH BENEFIT YOUR CALIFORNIAN. THIS FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS WILL HELP US GET MORE CALIFORNIANS OUTDOORS INCLUDING. INTRODUCING OURSELVES TO STE CUSTOMERS WE TYPICALLY HAVE A THOUGHT ABOUT. AS AN EXAMPLE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES IN OUR URBAN CORES. AND LASTLY THIS PROGRAM AND PROPOSAL WILL HELP US PROVIDE STABILITY IN SERVICES. AS AN EXAMPLE. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS. WE HAVE TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO PLANTS AND ANIMALS THAT ARE PROTECTED UNDER STATE LAW IN THE STATE. MOST OF THOSE ARE FOUND ON PRIVATE LANDS. THIS BUDGET PROPOSAL WOULD ALLOW US TO BUILD SPECIFIC PROGRAMS. PRIVATE LANDS COLLABORATION. AND REGULATORY PROTECTION FOR THOSE LANDOWNERS IN WATER USERS WHO WANT TO DO GOOD CONSERVATION BUT NOT REMAIN EXPOSED UNDER STATE ENDANGERED SPECIES LAW. SO. I THINK IN A MOMENT AND LATER YOU MIGHT HEAR ABOUT A NEXUS PROBLEM. NEXUS MEANS A CONNECTION. BETWEEN SOURCE AND EXPENDITURE. I WILL TELL YOU THAT THE UC DAVIS WROTE ECOLOGY CENTER IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN ESTIMATES. THAT THE TOTAL ANNUAL COST OF WILDLIFE VEHICLE CONFLICT IN THE STATE. IS AT LEAST TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. AND THAT AS A CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATE THERE ABOUT SEVEN THOUSAND WILDLIFE VEHICLE CONFLICTS. PER YEAR ACROSS THE STATE. IN ADDITION OUR GAME WARDENS AND OUR DEPARTMENT ARE SWORN PEACE OFFICERS. IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN A LOAN. THAT FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND CONTACTS ACROSS CALIFORNIA WITH CITIZENS OFTEN THOSE CITIZENS ARE IN CARS. AND ON ROADS. AND JUSTIN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. THEY ISSUE TWELVE THOUSAND VEHICLE CALLED CITATIONS. WHY IS THIS INFORMATION RELEVANT? TWO MAIN FUNCTIONS OF THIS PROPOSAL OUR TO EMPLOY THE MOTOR VEHICLE ACCOUNT. AND A TIRE RECYCLING FUND. TO GENERATE THE FIFTY POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS. AT THE END OF THE DAY. IT'S A PROBLEM THAT'S BEEN AROUND LONGER THAN I'VE BEEN ALIVE. EVERYONE AGREES IT'S A PROBLEM STABLE FUNDING. AND I WOULD SUBMIT HOW WE CHOOSE TO MAKE BUDGET PRIORITIES. IS AN EXPRESSION OF OUR VALUES. THEY'RE MORE ANIMALS AND PLANTS IN THIS STATE THAN ANY STATE IN THE UNION. THAT IS ONE OF TWENTY FIVE. BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY HOT SPOTS ON THE ENTIRE PLANET. DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL MYLES MISSION IS TO STEWARD THAT RESOURCE. AND EVERYONE AGREES WE LACKS SUSTAINABLE FUNDING TO DO THAT JOB. I'LL STOP THERE. THANK YOU. OTHER ALEJO. TINKLING GOOD MORNING RACHEL EHLERS WITH ALEJO. ALTHOUGH WITH THIS PROPOSAL IT'S TEMPTING TO START DIVING STRAIGHT INTO THE FUNDING SOURCES THAT ARE PROPOSED AND WHETHER WE THINK THAT THOSE ARE REASONABLE OR NOT WE WOULD ACTUALLY RECOMMEND. THAT YOU BEGIN WITH WHAT YOU WANT THE DEPARTMENT TO DO WHAT TASKS DO YOU WANTED TO DO THEN. TURN TO HOW YOU'RE GOING TO FUND IT SO BEGINNING THERE WE WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND ADDRESSING THE ON GOING TWENTY MILLION DOLLAR GAP THAT THE DIRECTOR. MENTIONED THAT STRUCTURAL IMBALANCE IN ORDER TO SUPPORT. THE EXISTING ACTIVITIES OF THE DEPARTMENT IS UNDERTAKING AND NOT HAVE THIS PROBLEM KEEP COMING BEFORE YOU AS IT HAS FOR FOR RECENT YEARS. THERE IS ALSO A STRONG CASE FOR SOME LEVEL OF AUGMENTATION FOR THE DEPARTMENT WE AGREE WITH THAT PARTICULARLY GIVEN. CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE CHALLENGES OF A GROWING POPULATION IN THE STATE. THAT PACKAGE OF ACTIVITIES THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS PUT BEFORE YOU WE THINK IS A REASONABLE STARTING PLACE IN PARTICULAR THOSE ACTIVITIES THAT ARE FOCUSED ON. PROTECTING US AND ASSISTING THE STATE'S ENDANGERED SPECIES BUT YOU MAY HAVE OTHER PRIORITIES FOR A PACKAGE THAT YOU'RE PUTTING TOGETHER FOR THE DEPARTMENT. SO ONCE YOU FIGURE OUT WHAT IT IS YOU WANT THE DEPARTMENT TO DO AND HOW MUCH TIME AND THAT WILL COSTA THEN IT WOULD BE TIME TO TURN TO WHAT FUNDING SOURCES SO AS WAS MENTIONED THERE THREE SOURCES PROPOSED BY THE ADMINISTRATION. EIGHTEEN MILLION FROM THE MOTOR VEHICLE COUNT TWENTY SIX MILLION FROM A TIRE RECYCLING MANAGEMENT FUND AND THEN SEVEN MILLION FROM THE GENERAL FUND. SO STARTING WITH THE NBA THE MOTOR VEHICLE COUNT WE THINK THIS IS REASONABLE AND CONCEPT TO USE THIS FUNDING SOURCE THE CONSTITUTION DOES SAY THAT IT CAN BE USED FOR MITIGATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS. OF OF MOTOR VEHICLES I THINK OUR CONCERN HERE IS THAT WE HAVEN'T YET SEEN. AND ACCOUNTING OUR DEPARTMENT FOR HOW MUCH WOULD BE REASONABLE HOW MUCH OF THEIR WORKLOAD IS ACTUALLY A RESULT OF MOTOR VEHICLES WE THINK THAT'S pIMPORTANT BOTH FROM A LEGAL BASIS AND A POLICY BASIS FOR USING THAT FUNDING SOURCE. SO WE'RE STILL WAITING FOR THAT BUT WE THINK THAT THAT THAT FUNDING SOURCE COULD BE REASONABLE AND. THE MODEST AMOUNT THAT IS PROPOSED THAT FUND COULD SUSTAIN. WHEN. A WHEN YOU SAY YOU'RE STILL WAITING FOR THAT THAT IN FIRST THAT YOU EXPECT TO RECEIVE IT AND THEN THE DEPARTMENT HAVE INDICATED THEY'RE WORKING ON IT YES. AND THAT WINNER THEN THE NEED FOR KIND OF A TIMELINE. ARE WE LOOKING AT. MORE THAN DAYS LESS THAN YOU KNOW WEAKER SO WHERE WORKING ON. THAT WORK LOAD JUSTIFICATION GREAT THE CLOSE ENOUGH THANK YOU. AND FOR THE TIRE FUND HOWEVER WE HAVEN'T SEEN ANY JUSTIFICATION EVEN WITH THE INITIAL INFORMATION DEPARTMENTS PROVIDED THAT HAS THAT NEXUS THIS IS THAT. THERE WAS APPROVED AS A TWO THIRDS VOTE IT IT IS A FEE IT'S CALLED A FEE IN THE LEGISLATION. AND WE HAVEN'T SEEN. VETERANS OF JUSTIFICATION THAT WOULD LINK THEY USE I HAVE A FEE ON TIRES FOR WORKLOAD FOR THE DEPARTMENT. AGAIN NAME THEY MAY BE ABLE TO PROVIDE SOME INFORMATION BUT BASED ON WHAT WE HAVE SEEN INITIALLY WE HAVEN'T SEEN THAT NEXUS. ADDITIONALLY THIS FUND IS SCHEDULED THIS PORTION OF THE FUN THAT THAT IS PROPOSED TO BE REDIRECTED TO THE PARCHMENT IS SCHEDULED TO SUNSET AND TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. AND SO WE HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT EXPANDING NEW ACTIVITIES AND PROGRAMS UNDER THE. HEADER OF A SUSTAINABLE FUNDING SOURCE WHEN THE FUND IS. EXPECTED TO SUNSET AND THEN THE LEGISLATURE WOULD FACE ANOTHER TIME SIMILAR. ONGOING PROBLEM IN A FEW YEARS. AND THEN OF AB ONE COMPONENT OF THAT ALSO AS WELL AS I THINK WAS MENTIONED IS THAT THIS THIS TIRE FUND IS CURRENTLY. TIME USED BY THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD IS A PART OF THE PROPOSAL TO RE DIRECTED TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE WOULD REQUIRE OR IS BEING PROPOSED TO USE OF BACKFILL. COME FROM THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND FOR THE AIR BE THAT MAKE THEM HOLD SO WE KNOW THE LEGISLATURE HAS A LOT OF OTHER PRIORITIES FOR THE DDR FUNDING SO. YEAH THAT DID THIS WOULD REDUCE AVAILABLE FUNDS FOR OTHER PRIORITIES AND WHAT ABOUT THE MOTOR VEHICLE COUNT TO FUNDING DOES THAT CONSTITUTE DIVERSION THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE BACK FILLED THEM NO THERE'S A FOR WELL. THAT THINK YOU PROBABLY HEAR FROM SOME PUBLIC COMMENT THERE IS FUNDING IN THAT I'M FUND BALANCE FOR THAT THAT COULD SUPPORT SO THERE'S NO DIRECT BACKFILL. BUT THAT FUND IS LARGE AND SUPPORTS MANY OTHER ACTIVITIES AND SO TO THE DEGREE YOU'RE USING IT HERE YOU DON'T HAVE IT AVAILABLE FOR SOME OF THOSE OTHER ACTIVITIES THAT TIME. THAT IT CURRENTLY SUPPORTS THERE'S NO DIRECTORY DIRECTION BACK FILL AS THERE IS WITH THE TIRE FUND IN THIS CASE HOWEVER. SO WE WOULDN'T AT THIS POINT RECOMMEND REJECTING THE USE OF. OF THE TIRE FUND BECAUSE OF ALL OF THOSE CONCERNS THAT I OUTLINES NO NEXUS BOB THE SUNSET AND THE REQUIRED TO BACK FILL. SO THAT LEAVES YOU WITH. GENERAL FUND FEES OR NEW TAXES THOSE ARE KIND OF YOUR OTHER MIX OF AVAILABLE FUNDS IF YOU WANT TO SUPPORT AN AUGMENTATION FOR THIS. DEPARTMENT. AS WAS MENTIONED THEY ARE GOING THROUGH A BUDGETARY REVIEW RIGHT NOW THAT'S TAKING A LOOK AT HOW THEY'RE USING THEIR EXISTING REVENUES AND HOW WELL THOSE ALIGNED WITH THEIR EXISTING ACTIVITIES IT'S HARD. TO MAKE A DECISION WITHOUT KNOWING THAT INFORMATION AND YOU WON'T HAVE IT BASED ON THEIR TIMELINE BY THE TIME YOU NEED TO MAKE A DECISION FOR THIS BUDGET. SO ONE OPTION YOU HAVE IS YOU COULD USE GENERAL FUND TO MAKE. AUGMENTATIONS ABOVE AND BEYOND WHAT YOU CHOOSE TO USE FROM NBA OR OTHER SOURCES AND THEN REVISIT IT IN THE SUBSEQUENT YEAR ONCE YOU'VE GOT THE RESULTS OF THAT BUDGETARY REVIEW TO SEE IF OTHER FEES OR. OTHER SOURCES MAY BE APPROPRIATE. WE DO THINK THAT THAT'S PART OF OUR PACKAGE OF RECOMMENDATIONS. WE RECOMMEND INCLUDING A STATUTORY DEADLINE FORCE AT STATUS UPDATE A WRITTEN STATUS UPDATE ON THAT ON THAT BUDGETARY REVIEW SO THAT IN BUDGET YEAR PLUS WHEN YOU HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TO REVISIT THIS. DECISION IN THIS PACKAGE OF FUNDS SOURCES RIGHT NOW THERE IS THERE WERE THERE WAS A BUDGETARY. DEADLINE. BASED ON THE PERCHED THAT ADMINISTRATION HAS TAKEN IN THIS REVIEW. FROM THAT THEY'RE TAKING A LITTLE BIT LONGER THEY'RE DOING A MORE IN DEPTH REVIEW BUT WE THINK YOU KNOW SETTING A DEADLINE FOR WHEN YOU'RE GOING TO GET THAT INFORMATION WE RECOMMEND THIS OCTOBER. SO THAT INFORMS YOU OF WHETHER THIS REVIEW IS GIVING YOU THE INFORMATION YOU NEED AND SETS YOU UP FOR A DISCUSSION NEXT YEAR OF REVISITING WHAT THAT FUNDING SOURCE. MAY BE GOING FORWARD. THANK YOU DEPARTMENT FINANCE COMMENTS. THANK YOU JULIANNE MOORE IS IN THE WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THE THE ADMINISTRATION APPROACHED THE ISSUES SURROUNDING THAT DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE AS A WHOLE AND. THIS PACKAGE THAT THAT'S BEFORE YOU. MAKES. MAKES SENSE IT PROVIDES THE DEPARTMENT WITH A LONG TERM SUSTAINABLE AND STABLE FUNDING SOURCE. IT MADE SENSE FROM A LEGAL PERSPECTIVE ARTICLE NINETEEN DOES ALLOW THE USE OF THE MOTOR VEHICLE. FEES TO BE USED FOR THESE ACTIVITIES. IT. FROM A POLICY PERSPECTIVE IT PROVIDES. AN ONGOING. BACK FILL BASICALLY FOR THEIR STRUCK OR ANSWER TO THEIR STRUCTURAL DEFICIT AND IT ALLOWS THE DEPARTMENT TO CONTINUE PROVIDING. AT LEAST THOSE SERVICES WITHOUT ANY CUTS. AND THEN IT ALSO PROVIDES ADDITIONAL FUNDING. TO PROVIDE FOUR SOME OF THE PROGRAM EXPANSION AND TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE SOME OF THE LEGISLATIVE MANDATES THAT HAVE COME DOWN THAT WE HAVEN'T FUNDED IN THE PAST. FROM A FISCAL PERSPECTIVE. AS FAR IS THE TIRE FUND. WE DO FEEL THAT IT IS IT DOES HAVE NEXUS AUTOMOBILES ARE. CREATING. AS OUR DIRECTOR BONHAM HAD HAD MENTIONED. NUMEROUS INCIDENTS WITH THE WILDLIFE IN CALIFORNIA. AND. SO IT IT IT HAS BEEN PASSED BY A TWO THIRDS VOTE HAS ASKED THE LA O. NOTED. AND IT CAN BE USED FOR THAT WE'VE KEPT KARL MOYER THE CARL MOYER PROGRAM HOLE. BY BACK FEELING THAT TWENTY SIX MILLION WITH ADDITIONAL. GIGI R. F.. AND IT IS THE INTENT TO CONTINUE TO DO THAT. THANK YOU. SO THE. BUDGET PROPOSAL HAS ABOUT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS SOON ENOUGH FUNDING FROM THE GENERAL FUND TO FIGHT REMEMBER THE NUMBER YES CORRECTLY. I AND AND IT'S BEEN SUGGESTED BY FOLKS WHO ARE UNHAPPY WITH THE OTHER. IDENTIFIED SOURCES THAT THE AN ENTIRE AMOUNT BE. FUNDED OUT OF THE. OUT OF THE GENERAL FUND. WHAT'S THE REASON THAT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IS NOT RECOMMENDING THAT VERSUS THESE OTHER SOURCES SINCE THERE. ARE. I FELT. CLEARLY CALLS ON THE ON ON THE OTHER RESOURCES THAT ARE THAT ARE BEING IDENTIFIED. MISS. A CHAIR MAT. MARROW RESPOND FIRST JR. SO. I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT PROSPECT AND I UNDERSTAND IT. BUT I THINK PASSED COULD BE PRO LAW. SO THE REASON WHY OUR DEPARTMENT HAS AN IMBALANCE RIGHT NOW IN OUR MAIN REPOSITORY. IS LARGELY BECAUSE OF EARLIER FUN SHIPS OFF OF THE GENERAL FUND. YOU CAN COUNT THE AMOUNT OF MONEY. THE DEPARTMENT FUND SHIFTED OFFER. SO IN MY JUDGMENT RUNNING OUR DEPARTMENT. GENERAL FUND WILL ALWAYS REMAIN CYCLICAL. AND AN ANNUAL DETENTION BETWEEN APPROPRIATE EXPENDITURES ACROSS A WHOLE SUITE OF STATE. INTEREST. I ACKNOWLEDGE IT'S A POSSIBLE OPTION. BUT JUST LIKE I DEL CURRENTLY THERE MAY BE AN APPETITE IN THE LEGISLATURE FOR A. TAX. RELATED OUTDOOR GOODS OR OTHER FUNCTIONS. AND LIKE I DOUBT. THERE ARE THAT MANY SECTORS IN OUR PORTFOLIO WE CAN INCREASE FEES ON. OUR GOAL THAT OUR DEPARTMENT IS TRYING TO FIND AN ADDITIVE MORE SUSTAINABLE FUND SOURCE. AND GENERAL FUND CREATES RISK FOR US IN THE DEPARTMENTAL LEVEL THAT WHAT THE LORD GIVETH. THE LORD MIGHT TAKE IT THE WAY. I HOPE THAT'S SOMEWHAT INSTRUCTIVE FROM WHERE WE SAID AND I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO WAY AND. EVEN THOUGH YOU DIRECTED THE QUESTION TO THE DEPARTMENT FUNDS I THINK OF. QUESTION WHETHER DIVINE INTERVENTION IS NECESSARY HERE. I I I I THINK. YOUR POINT IF I CAN. SAVE MORE AND MORE COLLOQUIAL FASHION IS THAT TO. WHEN THE NEXT DOWNTURN HAPPENS AS EVERYONE PREDICTS AT SOME POINT IT WILL UNFORTUNATELY. FISH AND WILDLIFE IS ONE OF THE FIRST PLACES NOT ONE OF THE LAST PLACES THAT. WE RETURNED TO FOR HER AT A TRIMMING THE BUDGET IN ORDER TO MAKE UP THE SHORTFALLS SET. YET EARLY ACCURATE. SAID BETTER. QUESTION MR FUNG. GONNA TAKE ROLE SINCE WE GOT THREE PEOPLE HAVE IT ABOUT IT WILL DO THAT AFTER OKAY. FEET BEFORE PUBLIC COMMENT AFTER WE'RE DONE WITH THIS DESCRIPTION. BUT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. SO I OF COURSE HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS ON ON THE DIVERSIONS OF THE MOTOR VEHICLE FUND. AND THE TIRE FEE CAR MORE FUNDS TO GO TO AND THE EXPANSION OF PROGRAM ACTIVITIES FROM THE PUBLIC OFFICIAL WHILE I. SO ARE YOU SAYING THAT THE MY UNDERSTANDING AND MAYBE SOME. WHAT THE CAR REGISTRATION? FEET UP PAYMENTS ARE MADE NOW WE'RE WHERE DOES THAT GO CURRENTLY WHAT PROGRAMS IF THE PART AND I SAID CAN ANSWER THIS WHERE IS A BILL CURRENTLY. IT IT I AM ON MY ASSUMPTION IS THAT IT. OF MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IT PAYS FOR DMV OPERATIONS AND CHP OPERATIONS BUT THIS CAR. SO THERE'S A CLEAR NEXUS THAT WENT A CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW IS PAYING THEIR CAR REGISTRATION FEES THAT'S GOING TO PAY THOSE PROGRAMS. THAT IS CORRECT IT ALSO ALLOWS FOR THE MITIGATION OF ANY NEGATIVE IMPACTS. SO THEN. MAYBE YOU CAN CLARIFY THAT THE NEXUS TO THE TO THE. WHAT DO YOU SAY TO A CALIFORNIA WHO'S PAYING THEIR COURAGE AND HE'S NOW AND AND YOU'RE ASKING NOW FOR THAT MONEY TO BE DIVERTED TO FISH AND WILDLIFE? THE FIRST THING I WOULD SAY IN THIS HYPOTHETICAL IS THANK YOU. THE SECOND THING I WOULD SAY. IS. UNDER CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION ARTICLE NINETEEN SECTION THREE BE. THE CONSTITUTION SAYS THE MONEY CAN BE USED FOR. RESEARCH PLANNING CONSTRUCTION IMPROVEMENT MAY NETS IN OPERATION. A PUBLIC STREETS AND HIGHWAYS INCLUDING THE MITIGATION OF THEIR ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS. ROADS VEHICLES HAVE ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS THE VILLAGE RATED SOME OF THE DATA AROUND THAT. THE THIRD THING I'D SAY IS. OUR WILDLIFE OFFICERS ARE. SWORN PEACE OFFICERS UNDER THE PENAL CODE. DAN IN DAY OUT THEY END UP ISSUING CITATIONS ABOUT. THE LAWS IN OPERATIONS OF OUR STREETS AND HIGHWAYS. SO THEN. WITH THAT CREATE A PROBLEM FOR. IF FOR EXAMPLE WITH THE CHP AND IDEA V. AS THERE WOULD THERE BE AN ISSUE WITH THEIR FUNDING IF THE F. NOW WERE. IF THE GENERAL FUND IS SUSPICIOUS AS YOU INDICATED AND THAT YOU NEED A STABLE REVENUE SOURCE I WOULD ASSUME THAT THE DMV IN THIS YEAR'S P. ALSO IT IS ABLE REVENUES. SO OVER CONSTANTLY DIVERTING MONEY FROM PROGRAM TO PROGRAM OUT HOW WE SETTING EIGHT EIGHT EIGHT. A DIFFICULT PRESIDENT'S HERE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER FONG I THINK THAT'S A LEGITIMATE QUERY JUST WHY I APPRECIATE ALEJO'S SUGGESTION WE START BIG PICTURE ABOUT PURPOSE AND NEED. I WOULD IMAGINE YOU SEE ME AGAIN MULTIPLE TIMES. AND WE'LL GET INTO FUND SOURCE. A PRINCIPAL FOR OUR DEPARTMENT IN THIS ENDEAVOR. IS TO KNOCK GORE SOMEONE ELSE'S OX. THAT'S TRUE AS TO THE MOTOR VEHICLE CAL IT'S ALSO TRUE TO THE TIRE RECYCLING FUND. WHICH SUPPORTS OUR COLLEAGUES IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITY. IT'S WHY WE WERE SEEKING A BACK FILL. ONE TO ONE SO THERE WOULD NOT BE A LOSS ON THE MOTOR VEHICLE ACCOUNT. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IT BRINGS IN ABOUT THREE POINT FIVE BILLION A YEAR IN REVENUE. AND THAT IT'S FUND BALANCES SOMEWHERE BETWEEN THREE HUNDRED AND FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. NOW I DON'T ARGUE THE DMV AND CHP MAY VALUE THAT EIGHTEEN MILLION DOLLARS. BUT I WOULD PUT THAT EIGHTEEN MILLION IN THE CONTEXT OF FUND BALANCE THAT MAY BE AT FOUR HUNDRED MILLION. SO WHAT IS THE NEXUS EGGS CAN YOU CAN YOU DETAIL AND DID IT SO MY UNDERSTANDING IS YOU INDICATED THAT THERE ARE VEHICLES THAT. THEY UNFORTUNATELY OF OUR HER HITTING WILDLIFE AND SO WE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ADDRESS THAT CONCERN AND THAT THAT'S THE NEXUS OF WHY YOU CAN TAKE A EUROPE THAT THE. THAT THE PROPOSAL IS TO TO DIVERT WATER VEHICLE FUNDING TO FISH WILDLIFE. I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE IS LIKELY. DISCUSSION PERHAPS DISAGREEMENT OVER THE NEXUS WE ALLEGE I APPRECIATE THAT. BUT AGAIN. I THINK THERE ARE AT LEAST TWO VARIABLES THAT ESTABLISHED THE NEXUS. THE SINGLE BIGGEST KILLER OF WILDLIFE IN THE STATE OUR CARS. SECOND. OUR GAME WARDENS. OVERSEE AND ADMINISTER NOT AS A PRIMARY ENTITY BUT CERTAINLY AS A SUPPORTING ENTITY. OF THE LAWS IN THE OPERATIONS OF OUR ROADS. AND HIGHWAYS. DO YOU THINK THAT THE AVERAGE CALIFORNIAN WOULD ACCEPT THAT NEXUS. I CAN'T SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THE AVERAGE CALIFORNIA BUT I PERSONALLY THINK IT'S A REASONABLE ARGUMENT. IN TERMS OF THE A DIVERSION OF THE. CARL MOYER FUNDS. A. IT'S BACK FILLED BY ONE YEAR. WHY WOULD NOT IF IT'S GONNA BE BACK THOUGH BY CAP AND TRADE DOLLARS WHY WOULDN'T CAP AND TRADE FUNDS BE USED TO ADDRESS THE SHORTFALL ORIGINALLY INCENTIVE? SHIFTING ALL THIS MONEY AROUND. GOOD MORNING METAL MANIA DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO JUST TO BE CLEAR ABOUT CAP AND TRADE. OTHER OUR LEGAL STRUCTURES AROUND THE CAP AND TRADE FUNDS WHERE. CAPITA NEEDS TO BE USED SPECIFICALLY FOR ACTIVISM REDUCE EMISSIONS GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION REDUCTIONS SO. WHEN YOU CONSIDER THE CAP INTRIGUED PACKAGE A LATER ON YOU'LL SEE THAT ALL OF THE PROGRAMS ARE RELATED TO REDUCING EMISSIONS OR SEQUESTERING EMISSIONS. UP THE CRIME LAWYER PROGRAM WHICH. SUPPORTS CLEAN TRUCKS AND VEHICLES. DOES HAVE THE EFFECT OF REDUCING EMISSIONS AND SO THEREFORE IT'S AN APPROPRIATE USE A CAP AND TRADE THE FISH AND WILDLIFE PROGRAMS THAT ARE ON THE TABLE RIGHT NOW. WHILE PERSPECTIVE DON'T NECESSARILY RESULTING IN A EMISSION REDUCTIONS ARE SEQUESTRATION. ARE HOWEVER BECAUSE OF THE. TIRES AND TIRES BEING A PROXY TO. THAT AFFECTS ON AUTOMOBILES HAVE ON WILDLIFE AND HABITAT IT'S A VERY A STRONG NEXUS OF FROM A POLICY. OKAY SO. SO WITH GIVE ME THE NEXUS AGAIN. I LIVE ON THE FUND THE TIRE FEE YEAH SO TIRES ARE THE. APART OF AUTOMOBILE USE IN CALIFORNIA. AND SO AS THE DIRECTORS MENTIONED. OVER THE PAST SEVERAL MOMENTS. THERE'S A CLEAR. ADVERSE EFFECT THAT AUTOMOBILE USE HAS BOTH FROM. WILDLIFE. IMPACT PERSPECTIVE AS WELL AS HABITAT FIRST. SO YOU INTO SO AND SO USING. A OF FUNDING SOURCE THAT IS LINKED TO AUTOMOBILE USE WHICH HAS THE NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON A OF THE ENVIRONMENT. IS A. CLEAR BOTH LEGAL IS A LEGAL USE AS WELL AS A UP POLICY USE. AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT. AND THEN. THE FUND'S THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE CURRENTLY FUNDED FROM THAT ARE MADE ENTIRELY HOLE THROUGH THE A CAP AND TRADE FOR. SO JUST SO I UNDERSTAND. TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS THAT'S BEEN FUNDED UNDER THE TIRE FEE THAT GET SHIFTED TO FISH AND WILDLIFE. AND THEN CAP AND TRADE. SHIFTED TO PAY BACK THOUGH COBBLER. CORRECT AND THAT'S GONNA BE DONE ONGOING BASIS ON AN ONGOING BASIS. NOW WE CAN'T TIE THE HANDS OF THE FUTURE LEGISLATURE HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT WE CAN. IT'S GONNA BE DONE ONGOING I'M MERELY REFLECTING WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION'S BUDGET PROPOSAL IS AND IN THE ADMINISTRATION'S BUDGET PROPOSAL WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING IS THAT TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS CAN. BE CONSIDERED ON GOING AS PART OF A SIMPLY A BASELINE. AND SO WHEN IT'S ADDED IN THE BASELINE WE DON'T COME BACK EVERY YEAR ASKING. FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDING THROUGH BCP'S IT'S JUST PART OF THE BASELINE AND THAT. S. A GENERAL SENSE. A IS A PRETTY SECURE OF FUND WAY TO FUND A PROGRAM. ADDED AS MAYBE I CAN MAYBE YOU CAN ANSWER BUT I I. I WOULD ASSUME THOUGH THAT IF YOU ARE DEALING WITH WILDLIFE AND WHILE HIGH WILDLIFE HABITAT AND PRESERVATION THAT THERE IS SOME CAP AND TRADE. TEXAS. THERE. TO DATE. THE SINGLE. DISTRIBUTION OF G. R. F. TO OUR DEPARTMENT. IS FOCUSED ON HABITAT RESTORATION THE ACTUAL PHYSICAL. RESTORATION OF WETLANDS WHICH FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH TURNED OUT TO BE. ONE OF THE HIGHER CARBON SEQUESTER THAT'S A WORD TYPE OF LANDSCAPES. AND THAT IS BECAUSE OF YOUR IMPORTANCE IN THE LEGISLATURE YOU'VE PUT ON A NEXUS TO CONTROLLING EMISSIONS. NOT MANAGING THE OTHER ASPECTS OF A WARMING CLIMATE WHICH ARE ADAPTATION RELATED. SO WE HAVE HAD VERY LIMITED YOU ARE A FUNDS. THAT IS BEEN DIRECTED TO THAT VERY CREDIBLE AND LEGITIMATE EMISSIONS CONTROL TO WETLAND RESTORATION. A IS IF YOU ARE QUESTIONS WHICH CHAIR AT IN TERMS TO THE LA SHOW ARE THERE OTHER AVENUES OF FUNDING I NEED YOU MENTIONED GENERAL FUND OTHER IS IT'S MY OUT. A MILE THE FIELD THAT CAP AND TRADE SHOULD NOT BE ON THE TABLE IN TERMS OF. OUR. JUDGE US IN THE SHORTFALL. YEAH I THINK WE WOULD PROBABLY. CONCUR WITH THE. STATEMENTS OF THE ADMINISTRATION AT LEAST RIGHT NOW GIVEN THE LEGAL OPINIONS THAT LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL HAS PUT ON THE USE OF GGF IN THE NEAR TERM. WITH THE NEXUS ON EMISSIONS. I THINK IN IN SOME OF THE DECISIONS HAVE BEEN AND SO AND FUTURE YEARS THERE MAY BE MORE FLEXIBILITY OVER HOW YOU USE THOSE FUNDS BUT. KICK COUNSELORS A PINE THAT AND IN THE NEAR TERM IT THAT NEXUS NEEDS TO BE BILLY GRAHAM. CLOSE TO GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND SEQUESTRATION. IN TERMS OF YOUR CONCERNS WITH THE NEXUS. HOW DO YOU DO YOU SEE A CLEAR NEXUS IS THIS NEXUS MAKES SENSE? I THINK AS AS I MENTIONED EARLIER WE SEE IN CONCEPTTHE NEXUS FOR THE NBA SEEMS THAT EVERYTHING THAT'S ON CONCEPT THOUGH WELL I DON'T THINK IN CONCEPT THE TIRE IS LESS THAT REASONABLE TO US AND I THINK WE WE WOULD DRIVE DISTINCTION BETWEEN THOSE TWO WHERE THAT WHERE. IS FOR THE NBA THE CONSTITUTION CLEARLY SAYS IT CAN USE FOR THE ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS OF MOTOR VEHICLES WE HAVE NOT YET SEEN THAT SPECIFIC ACCOUNTING AND JUST VISION OF WHAT WORKLOAD THE DEPARTMENT IS UNDERTAKING AS A RESULT OF THAT I THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. BOTH LEGALLY AND FROM A POLICY BASIS TO DETERMINE HOW MUCH. FOR THE NBA I THINK FOR THE TIRE GIVEN THE LANGUAGE THAT'S PROPOSED. AND THE WAY THE TIRE FEE HAS BEEN STRUCTURED WE WE WE DON'T EQUATE TIRES WITH. THE EFFECTS OF MOTOR VEHICLES MORE BROADLY WITH WE WE WILL LOOK AT IT A LITTLE BIT MORE NARROWLY AND. DIP IN NEGATIVE IMPACTS CREATED BY TIRES WE HAVEN'T SEEN THE JUST DUMPED HIM FOR THAT YET THEN MY LAST QUESTION IN TERMS OF SINCE IF THE NEXUS IS THAT. WE WANT TO PREVENT A. A A COLLISIONS AND ACCIDENTS BETWEEN VEHICLES AND WILDLIFE WHICH IS CERTAINLY IMPORTANT WHAT I HAVE AT OF THE EIGHTEEN MILLION DOLLARS THAT'S BEING DIVERTED. WHAT IS GOING TO BE DONE TO PREVENT THAT? QUESTION. BEFORE RESPONDING. I DON'T. BACK THEN IT. A. YOU YOU YOU IN THE LEGISLATURE. NEED TO SOLVE. THAT PARTICULAR PROBLEM I'M TRYING TO JUGGLE. BUT FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH HERE'S THAT PROBLEM. I THINK. IT'S POSSIBLE THE DEPARTMENT COULD FIND MORE SECTORS TO CHARGE FEES TO. BUT HONESTLY THAT'S GONNA RUN TO INDUSTRY. IT'S GOING TO RUN A BUSINESS. IT'S GOING TO RUN THE HUNTERS AND ANGLERS. AND I'M HOPING. INSTEAD DEFINED AN ADDITIVE FUND SOURCE WHICH HAS AN APPROPRIATE NEXUS THAT CAN SUPPORT BENEFITS FOR CALIFORNIANS. THAT AND THAT ENDEAVOR. I WILL ALSO SAY THAT. I BELIEVE WE CAN POINT TO SPECIFIC THINGS AND. SIMON OF POSITIONS THAT RELATE TO THE WILDLIFE COLLISION NEXUS. I ALSO THINK IT'S TRUE THAT. WE WERE TRANSPARENT TEN ALLOCATING THE FIFTY MILLION IN THE NINETY EIGHT POSITIONS. THAT A INCREDIBLY GRANULAR LEVEL OF DETAIL. SO EVERYONE COULD SEE WHAT WE WERE PROPOSING. SOME OF THIS WORK AS DESCRIBED WOULD OCCUR IN THE OCEAN. BUT IT'S ALSO TRUE THAT THERE'S A WAY TO ENCOURAGE IT TECHNICAL FUND SHIFT WITHIN OUR DEPARTMENT. AS AN EXAMPLE OUR WARDENS. PERHAPS WITH THIS PROPOSAL. IT COME OFF OF OTHER FUN SOURCES WERE USING FOR SOME OF THEIR ACTIVITIES. WE COULDN'T MOVE THEM TO THE M. V. A AS AN EXAMPLE. WHICH WOULD FREE UP OUR BUDGETING FLEXIBILITY TO THEN USE EXISTING SOURCES FOR THAT MARINE WORK. SO THAT IS PART OF THE ARCHITECTURE BEHIND. I THINK ONE OF OUR MOST DETAILED PROPOSALS. MISTER FUNG I AGREE THAT ONE OF OUR NEXT STEPS THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS TO DO THE QUANTIFICATION THE WORKLOAD JUSTIFICATION. AND PRESENT THAT TO YOU AND STAFF I ACCEPT THAT SO. OF IT I JUST ALSO WANTED TO ADD THAT YOU HAD ALLUDED EARLIER IN DISCUSSING THE MOTOR VEHICLE COUNT HOW IT SUPPORTS. CHP AS WELL SCHEME BE IN THAT IT'S. IMPACT TRUE OF THE OTHER DEPARTMENT THINK IT'S FUNDED IS THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD. AND SO I DON'T WANNA LOSE SIGHT OF THE FACT THAT THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD. AYE AS AN ENVIRONMENTAL AGENCY THAT'S CHARGED WITH A ADDRESSING THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF AUTOMOBILE USE IS ALREADY. A SO THOSE ARE THE PRESIDENT TO USING A VA FOR THOSE TYPES OF ACT OF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS. THANK YOU SO I'LL JUST CONCLUDE BY SAYING I KNOW THAT THERE'S A. A A QUEST TO FIND A NEXUS THAT IN IN MY OPINION IT IS A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO WRAP MY HANDS AROUND. I THINK THAT BEFORE WE LOOK AT RAISING FEES OR. OR THE THREAT OF RAISING FEES I THINK WE HAVE SEE HONESTLY HAVE TO BE. REALISTIC IN TERMS OF LOOKING FOR FUNDS THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE. WHETHER IT'S A GENERAL FUND WHETHER IT'S THERE'S SOME NEXUS OF FOR A CAP AND TRADE DOLLARS THAT ARE THERE GOING TO BE THERE. BUT IN TERMS OF IN MY MIND AS. AS WERE ALL ELECTED BE STEWARDS OF THE TAXPAYER. I'M AND TAXPAYER DOLLARS A THERE'S A CLEAR NEXUS IN TERMS OF CAR REGISTRATION FEES THAT WENT. WHEN I WHEN I PAID MY TO LEARN A SIX DOLLARS TO AT THE DMV THAT IT GOES TO THOSE PROGRAMS AT THE DMV OPERATES. CHP CARBON TERMS OF A TRYING TO CLEAN UP OF VEHICLES AND IMPROVE ENGINES AND AND AND WHAT AND WHAT NOT AND THAT WHEN. UGH THE CALL MORE PROGRAM THAT CURRENT EXISTENCES ON BY THE TIRE AND IN A WE WERE TOLD AT THAT THAT'S ANY FIVE CENTS WAS GOING TO GO TO THIS PROGRAM. THE ALL OF A SUDDEN FROM YEAR TO YEAR WE KEEP SHIFTING MONEY AROUND BECAUSE THERE IS SOME. NEED A TO FILL A GAP. BECAUSE I THINK THAT IS BUT NOW WHETHER IT'S DONE IN THE PAST DOESN'T JUSTIFY THAT WE SHOULD CONTINUE TO DO IT OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN FOR FOR A VARIOUS THINGS. AND SO THAT'S MY CONCERN ESPECIALLY IF WE'RE GOING TO BASICALLY. ROB ONE AGENCY TO ANOTHER AGENCY SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. PATTERSON. UP. I THINK IT'S ONE THING. ARE TO BE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING BECAUSE YOU CAN. IT'S ANOTHER THING ENTIRELY. TO DO IT WHETHER YOU OUGHT OR OUGHT NOT TO DO IT. AND I WILL TELL YOU MY BIG HEART BURN IN ALL OF THIS IS THAT WE HAVE BEEN MAKING PROMISES TO THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. THIS PROPOSAL IN FRONT OF ME I THINK BREAKS THOSE PROMISES. AND I THINK THAT IS A VERY VERY SERIOUS BIG PICTURE. CONCERNED ABOUT THIS. THERE IS IN AREAS. THAT I REPRESENT. AND LOTS OF OTHER MEMBERS UP AND DOWN THE STATE. THERE IS AN UNDERCURRENT OF DISTRUST OF GOVERNMENT AND DISTRUST. BROUGH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BECAUSE THEY SEE PROMISES MADE AND A PROMISE IS BROKEN. THIS IS PRECISELY THE KIND OF THING. THAT CREATES UP MISS TRUST. OUR I SO I MEAN THE THE POINT YOU'RE MAKING IS WE CAN DO IT SO WE'RE GOING TO DO IT. I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD BE THINKING IN THOSE TERMS I THINK YOU SHOULD BE THINKING IN. TERMS OF WHETHER OR NOT THIS IS PROMISE A MAY PROMISE KEPT IN WHETHER OR NOT YOU OUGHT. BUT TO DO IT. SO NETANYAHU WHETHER THERE'S A. LIMITED NEXUS OR NOT. STRETCHING THE NEXUS IS IN MANY WAYS JUST. AN EXCUSE FOR DOING SOMETHING. A. TO PEOPLE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO TAKE MONEY FROM ONE THING OF AND AND PUT IT TO ANOTHER AYE I FIND THIS WHOLE EXERCISE TO BE VERY VERY TROUBLING. NUMBER TO THAT DAY THE CAR MORE YOUR PROGRAM THE TIRE PROGRAM ALL OF THAT. HAS BEEN VERY WELL RECEIVED IT HAS BEEN VERY VERY EFFECTIVE. AND THE PROMISE MADE HERE IS THAT DOWD WE'RE GONNA BACK PHILIP THE BACKFILL IS ON GOING. I LOOKED AT THE LANGUAGE I'VE BEEN VERY CAREFUL ABOUT THIS AND VERIFIED IN THE LANGUAGE OF ALL OF THIS. THERE IS NO ONGOING COMMITMENT. TO BACK FILL YOU CAN'T MAKE THAT ONGOING COMMITMENT. YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO TRUST. THE WILL OF THE VERY FORCES FACTORS THAT MAKE. TOUCHING THE GENERAL FUND PROBLEMATIC. AND SO THE RISK THAT YOU SUGGEST IN THE GENERAL FUND I THINK IS JUST AS MUCH. A SIGNIFICANT RISK. IN THIS OTHER REPROACH. AND THEN NOT. FINALLY THE UP. I FIND IT NOT I FIND IT BORDERLINE. HYPOCRITICAL. THAT OUT THAT ON ONE ITEM. YOU WOULD BE SO. CAREFUL AND PRECISE WITH RESPECT TO THE USE OF GREENHOUSE. GAS IS TO THE POINT THAT THAT. FUNDS THAT YOU WOULD DIE. CONSTRAIN THEM FROM SORT OF A LIMITED NEXUS TEST. WHEN IN FACT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TAKES. AWFUL LOT OF. A GREENHOUSE GAS MONEY. OUGHT TO PAY FOR OUT OF. HIGH SPEED RAIL THAT DOES NOT MEET THAT NEXUS IN ANY SINGLE POSSIBLE WAY. AND WE'VE HAD VERY CLEAR ANALYSIS FROM THE. FROM THE ARAB. NOT FROM OUR OUR OUR LEGISLATIVE ANALYST AT THAT JUST DOES NOT MAKE THAT NEXUS TESTS I I I REALLY FIND THE. AGAIN WE TALK ABOUT. MEAN THIS IS SMOKE AND MIRRORS THIS IS BUDGETING SHELL GAME. AND PEOPLE OUT HERE IN THIS AUDIENCE HAVE DISCOVERED AND THEY'RE NOT HAPPY AND I IS A SITTING MEMBER OF THIS. COMMITTEE ON NOT HAPPY EITHER. SO I JUST TO WRAP THIS UP IN AND WE HAVE A LOT OF OF OF FOLKS WHO WANT TO WORK. AT PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS ITEM. I'VE. IF YOU COULD RESPOND VERY QUICKLY TO A CONCERN THAT HAS BEEN ADDRESSED TO ME AND IN MY OFFICE BY FOLKS WHO ARE TROUBLED BY THE. BOTTOM. A FUNDING SOURCES SAID THAT ARE IDENTIFIED. PARTICULARLY WITH THE UP OF MOTOR VEHICLE FUND IT'S BEEN OBSERVED THAT. IT'S EIGHTEEN MILLION DOLLARS RIGHT. THAT THAT OPENS THE DOOR. AND THAT AS YOUR FUNDING NEEDS INCREASE THAT BECOMES AN EASY PLACE TO TURN TO SO YOU MAKE THE POINT WHICH MAKES UP. IN A CERTAIN AMOUNT SENSE TO ME IT'S ONLY A SMALL PORTION OF OF THAT FUND. I THINK THEIR ARGUMENT WOULD BE. WILL LIKE IT BUT THAT'S TODAY WHAT ABOUT TOMORROW SO. I DON'T KNOW THAT'S SOMETHING YOU CAN ADDRESS BUT I'D APPRECIATE HEARING YOUR THOUGHTS ON. NOW IF YOU CAN YEAH. I APPRECIATE NO TIME LIKE THE PRESENT DIRECT. I APPRECIATE THE ENGAGEMENT WITH EACH OF THE MEMBERS AND STAFF. A I THINK THAT'S A FAIR CONCERN. I THINK THAT'S A SLIPPERY SLOPE. CONCERN. I SUPPOSE THERE'S A WAY TO MANAGE THAT RISK. LIKE OUR DEPARTMENT IS WILLING TO ENTERTAIN THE IDEA OF REPORTING RESPONSIBILITY. AND SYNCHRONIZATION BETWEEN THE DEPARTMENT'S BUDGET BASE PROCESS UNDERWAY. AND FINE TUNING OUR BUDGET OVER TIME. I THINK I'D BE INTERESTED IN UNDERSTANDING. WHETHER THEIR CONDITIONS OF MY CONTROL THAT RISK. I I NEED A LITTLE MORE TIME TO REFLECT ON IT CARE FOR ENOUGH MONEY LIKE IT'S A. I WANTED TO GET THAT OUT THERE. BECAUSE I KNOW WE HAVE A. A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER PEOPLE WHO I SPEAK TO THIS ISSUE IN SO NINE MINUTE. WE'RE GONNA TAKE ROLE. BUT. LET ME JUST SAY TO FOLKS WHO ARE PREPARING TO STEP FORWARD. THAT I THINK WE'VE IDENTIFIED MOST IF NOT ALL OF THE ISSUES SO IN YOUR COMMENT YOU MIGHT WANT TO JUST IDENTIFY THOSE THAT YOU AGREE WITH OR DISAGREE WITH. BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO MAKE THE ARGUMENT ITSELF AGAIN. UNLESS YOU FEEL THAT THERE'S SOMETHING THAT WE REALLY NEST IN THE IN THE IN THE DISCUSSION. LISTICLE. BLOOM. HERE FONG. GARCIA. MULLIN. PATTERSON. WERE OFFICIAL. RIGHT LET'S A BEGIN PUBLIC COMMENT ANTI I'M GONNA ASK THAT YOU ALL. A TRY TO ADHERE TO A THIRTY SECOND. A COMMENT LIKE THAT IF AT ALL POSSIBLE. GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT OF LEEWAY ON THAT BUT YOU CAN SEE. WE HAVE FLOOD MANY MANY PEOPLE THERE'S ANOTHER ISSUE THAT FOLLOWS AT THE END OF OUR GENDER THAT'S GONNA ALSO GENERATE A LOT OF PUBLIC COMMENT PLEASE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS BRENDAN TO ACT ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA AIR POLLUTION CONTROL OFFICERS ASSOCIATION AYE THAT'S EXECUTIVE OFFICERS FROM ALL THIRTY FIVE LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS WE RUN THE MORE PROGRAM AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. AND YOU ALSO SHOULD HAVE ALL RECEIVED A LETTER. FROM A COALITION OF THOSE OPPOSED TO THE ADMINISTRATION'S ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL OUGHT TO DIVERT OF CARL MOYER FUNDS TO DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE. ALL IT'S A DIVERSE COALITION ON THE CARL MOYER PROGRAM HAS BEEN HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL NOT PROVEN. COST EFFECTIVE PROGRAM AND AN IMPORTANT PART OF OUR AIR POLLUTION CONSIST CONTROL STRATEGY SINCE NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT. I'M. WE ARE WERE PART OF A COALITION ALONG WITH MANY OF THE FEE ORGANIZATIONS THAT SIGNED THE LETTER A THAT YOU HAVE. TO EXTEND THE TIRE FEE FUNDING SOURCE FOR THEM WHERE PROGRAM IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO HAVE THAT WAS IN TWENTY THIRTEEN IS PART OF AB EIGHT. AND MANY IN THIS LEGISLATURE VOTED FOR THAT BILL WAS A TWO THIRDS VOTE BILL AND THERE WAS I ACTUALLY BIPARTISAN SUPPORT FOR THAT. THAT CARRIED THAT THE FUNDING SOURCE THROUGH TWENTY THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE. PROVIDING CERTAINTY OF FUNDING IS IMPORTANT FOR THEM WHERE PROGRAM WE THINK THIS PROPOSAL ACTUALLY UNDERMINES THE PROGRAM BY CALLING INTO QUESTION THE CERTAINTY OF THAT FUNDING. THEN BACK FILLING FROM THE CAP AND TRADE FUNDING I THINK IS ALSO A DOUBLE HIT BECAUSE OF WE BELIEVE THAT THE CAP AND TRADE FUNDING SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON. A THAT ARE CLIMATE MEETING HER CLIMATE GOALS AND OUR AIR QUALITY CALLS AND SO I WE URGE YOU TO AT REJECT THE PROPOSAL TO DIVERT THAT FUNDING FROM. FROM OTHER COLUMN WHERE PROGRAM AND THAT WE SINCERELY APPRECIATE YOUR THOUGHTFULNESS THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING THIS IS MY NAME IS KEN DELFINO AND I'M THE CALIFORNIA DIRECTOR WITH DEFENDERS OF WILDLIFE. I'VE BEEN THE DIRECTOR OF ONE DEFENDERS WHILE I FOR THE LAST SEVENTEEN YEARS IN THE LAST SEVENTEEN YEARS I'VE WORKED ON THE ISSUE OF TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO STABILIZE. THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE'S OF FUNDING SITUATION I'VE WATCHED VARIOUS EFFORTS BUDGET STABILIZE THE FUND. GENERAL FUND WAS USED THE LAST TIME AROUND THERE WAS THE BUDGET A STRUCTURAL DEFICIT IN THE PRESERVATION FUND. AND AS IT HAS BEEN POINTED OUT WE ARE BACK HERE AGAIN WHICH IS A REASON WHY GENERAL FUND IS NOT A GOOD WAY OF ADDRESSING THESE ISSUES. WE. STRONGLY SUPPORT THE PROPOSAL HAS BEEN PUT FORWARD BY THE ADMINISTRATION THERE'LL BE A NUMBER OF OTHER STAKEHOLDERS OF THAT WILL BE UP HERE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT AS WELL. IT IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF THE PRESERVATION FUND STRUCTURAL DEFICIT I'M AS NOTED THERE BEEN ONGOING EFFORTS TO DO YOU DEAL WITH THAT ALUM AND WE CANNOT FEE OUR WAY OUT OF THIS PROBLEM RIGHT NOW. AND WITH RESPECT TO THE. ADDITIONAL ACTIVITIES THAT BEEN. IDENTIFIED BY DIRECT DIRECTOR BONHAM TALKED ABOUT THEM AS ENHANCEMENTS. OF THE DEPARTMENT'S ACTIVITIES I WOULD ARGUE THAT THE ERROR MISSION CRITICAL ACTIVITIES THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED. THAT HAVE NOT BEEN FUNDED BECAUSE OF MANDATES THAT HAVE BEEN PASSED ON THE DIRECTING THE DEPARTMENT TO UNDERTAKE WILDLIFE CONSERVATION MARINE CONSERVATION ENFORCEMENT BUT THEN NO FUNDS HAVE BEEN PROVIDED FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO DO THOSE ACTIVITIES. SO. I WOULD JUST SIMPLY ASK THAT WHILE ISSUES HAVE BEEN RAISED ABOUT FUNDS SOURCE I THINK THAT THERE IS STRONG JUSTIFICATION FOR THE NEED. AND FOR THE ITEMS THAT. HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED BY THE DEPARTMENT TO BE FUNDED AND I WOULD ASK THAT YOU HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN. AND CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT FOR JUSTIFICATION FOR THE FUN SOURCES THAT IN ON IT IDENTIFIED THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

CHAIRMAN MEMBERS WERE A GROUP IT'S BECOME A HALF THE CALIFORNIA RIFLE PISTOL ASSOCIATION WE SUPPORT THIS AUGMENTATION AS OUTLINED BY THE DIRECTOR FOR THE NEEDS FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO MEET THEIR A REQUIREMENT.

UP WE MAKE NO JUDGMENT ABOUT THE NEED FOR THE DEPARTMENT'S. BUDGET I AM IN FACT I BELIEVE IF YOU WERE TO ASK MANY OF OUR BOARD MEMBERS AND MEMBERS WITH AN ARC ARE ASSOCIATIONS. THEY WOULD SUPPORT THE IDEA OF A STRONG AND HEALTHY DEPARTMENT WHAT WE DISAGREE WITH IS THE MOVEMENT OF THE AB EIGHT FUNDS ARE FROM THE KORAN WHERE PROGRAM WE ALSO RELY ON THOSE TO SIGNIFICANT BASIS IN THE SAN JOAQUIN BASS. VALLEY ONLY TO CLEAN THE AIR BUT TO MEET OUR FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR CLEAN AIR REQUIREMENTS AND SO WE OPPOSED THAT. EXCEPTION OF THIS PROPOSAL THANK YOU.

SOCIAL PROGRAM GOES A LONG WAY AND HELPING PROVIDE INCENTIVES IT CLEANER TRUCKS ON THE ROAD. AND WE THINK. IN THIS TIME WHERE WE'RE TRYING TO MEET VERY AGGRESSIVE CLEAN AIR GOALS HAVING SOME FISCAL UNCERTAINTY IS NOT A GOOD IDEA. SO WE SUPPORT THE CALL MORE PROGRAM AND WE ARE OPPOSED THIS PARTICULAR BUT ACTION THINKING. RULES PLAN COLLINS WITH THE MOUNTAIN LION FOUNDATION. ON A MOUNTAIN LION IS KILLED ON CALIFORNIA'S ROADS AND FREEWAYS ABOUT ONCE EVERY THREE DAYS IF YOU PUT INTO CONTEXT THAT THE DEPARTMENT ESTIMATES THAT. GIVEN THE AVAILABLE HABITAT THERE MAYBE THIRTY TWO HUNDRED MOUNTAIN LIONS IN THE STATE. THAT'S A REALLY HIGH NUMBER OF MOUNT LINE'S KILLED NOW TAKE THAT AND AND MULTIPLY THAT OUT THROUGH ALL OF THE OTHER SPECIES THAT ARE IMPACTED ON OUR STATE'S ROADS. AND I THINK THE NEXUS BECOMES QUITE CLEAR I ALSO THINK THAT CALIFORNIANS ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE SIGNIFICANCE OF WILDLIFE AND AND ITS NEXUS TO IT TO THEIR ROADS. LOOK AT THE LICENSE PLATES THAT CALIFORNIANS HAVE SUPPORTED ALL CONNECTED MANY CONNECTED TO WILDLIFE OF THE STATE. SO WE ARE AND I'M SUPPORT OF THE ENTIRE AMENDED BUDGET AS I OUTLINED BY THE DEPARTMENT. AND HOPE THAT YOU WILL CONSIDER I'M AS YOU TAKE YOUR DRIVE HOME.

GOOD AFTERNOON SANDY ELLSWORTH WITH THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE FOUND ARE. FOR MANY THE PREVIOUSLY STATED REASONS WE STRONGLY SUPPORT LONG TERM AND STIFF SUSTAIN FUNDING FOR DFW. AND WHILE THE PROPOSED BUT THAT BUDGET SUPPORTS A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT PROGRAMS WE WANT TO UNDERSCORE THE PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE OF INVESTMENTS IN MARINE FISHERIES MANAGEMENT AND ARENA RELATED LAW ENFORCEMENT.

RIGHT NOT TO SPEAK AGAINST THE NEED FOR MORE FUNDING AT THE DEPARTMENT BUT CONCERNED OPPOSED TO THE TIRE FEET DIVERSION. A THOUGHT THAT YOU HAVEN'T THIRD HEARD ON THE NEXUS ISSUE. ARE ON THAT ISSUE. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT ITS CARS THAT WREAKED SUCH HAVOC ON OUR WILDLIFE'S NOT THE TIRES ON THOSE CARS. YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS AARON READ REPRESENT CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION HIGHWAY PATROLMAN. A FIRST FOLLOWED ME SAY WE HAVE THE HIGHEST RESPECT FOR THE SCIENTISTS THAT WORK IT FISH AND WILDLIFE. WE SUPPORT THEM GETTING THE FUNDING BUT WE BELIEVE THAT THE NBA'S AN APPROPRIATE SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR. DEPARTMENT OF WE WOULD SUPPORT ANY OTHER SOURCES. THE GENERAL FUND IS PROVIDED ONLY A SMALL PORTION OF THEIR BUDGET IT SEEMS KIND OF CRAZY THAT WE DON'T LOOK TOWARDS AT SOURCE SINCE THERE'S A HUGE BUDGET SURPLUS. THIS YEAR GRANTED THEIR YEARS IT'S WIENER BUT DURING THE LEAN YEARS HE DIDN'T GO THROUGH ANY LAYOFFS NO EMPLOYEES WERE LAID OFF. OF THAT THEY DID SPACE CUTS THAT'S FOR SURE SO WE SUPPORT THEM BEING MADE WHOLE BUT THE NBA COUNT IS VERY TENTATIVE LET ME JUST SAY MY FORTY YEARS. OF REPRESENTING THE HIGHWAY PATROL ASSOCIATION. ALMOST ALL OF THOSE YEARS THE VOTE REQUIRED WAS TWO THIRDS VOTE AND THE THE RESPONSIBILITY FELL TO THE ASSOCIATION TO TRY TO INCREASE THAT. AMOUNT A YEAR AFTER YEAR AND IT WAS A HEAVY LIFT. AND IS ONCE AGAIN BECOME A HEAVY LIFT BECAUSE A CAR TAX IS INCREASING WITH THE PASSAGE OF SB ONE WE NOW HAVE AN ADDED TAX IN ADDITION TO THE TWELVE CENTS PER GALLON. WE HAVE AN ADDED TAX ON CARS IN ADDITION TO THE VEHICLE REGISTRATION FEE SO THERE'S REALLY. A THREE DIFFERENT FUNDS TO GET THE NBA A LICENSE OF MOTOR VEHICLE ACCOUNT. THE VLF VEHICLE LICENSE FEE WHICH IS A PERSONAL PROPERTY TAXPAYER CAR IN THE THIRD TAXES PART OF SP ONE. SO IT'S BECOME A MUCH HARDER LIFT IF I MAY JUST QUOTE TWO SHORT SENTENCES FROM YOUR ANALYSIS. ON PAGE. EIGHTEEN. WHERE DISCUSSES THE NBA CAO THE SECOND PARAGRAPH SAYS FURTHER THIS ACCOUNT HAS BEEN UNDER PRESSURE IN RECENT YEARS AND WOULD HAVE A PROJECTED SHORTFALL? IF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET DID NOT INCLUDE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED MILLION AND PROPOSALS TO SHIFT CAPITAL OUTLAY PROJECTS PREVIOUSLY FUNDED. FROM THE NBA. TO LEASE REVENUE BONDS. THESE AT THIS ADDED PRESSURE ON THE NBA. COULD POTENTIALLY RESULT INCREASING FEES ON MOTORS IT WILL RESULT INCREASING FEES WILL HAVE TO COME BACK AND GET A VEHICLE. A. BLF FOR AN MBA INCREASE AND WILL PROBABLY HAVE TO DO IT NEXT THIS YEAR. OR NO LATER THAN NEXT BECAUSE THAT AND ALSO THE LEAST REVENUE BONDS WILL COST HAS OVER A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN INTEREST. OVER THE LIFE OF FINANCING THESE PROJECTS SO FOR THOSE REASONS WERE OPPOSED TO THAT. SOURCE OF FUNDING. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS JENNIFER FEARING HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE MOUNTAIN LION FOUNDATION DEFENDERS OF WILDLIFE AND ALSO LIKE TO EXPRESS THE SUPPORT OF ASSUME.

GENERAL RESTRICTIONS ABOUT GETTING THAT WORK DONE A IN ADVANCE OF THE FLOOD CONTROL SEASON OF THAT BEGINS ON ON NOVEMBER FIRST. FINALLY. BECAUSE IT ALSO RELATES TO OROVILLE HAVE THE STATE WATER PROJECT IN ALL ASPECTS OF THE DEPARTMENT'S MISSION. I WANT TO GIVE YOU A BRIEF UPDATE ON THE STATE WIDE WATER CONDITIONS OTHER BEEN MANY QUESTIONS BREWING OVER THE PAST. FEW MONTHS ABOUT THE LIKELIHOOD OF A RETURN TO DROUGHT. THAT WE HAVE MOST RECENTLY BEEN EXPERIENCING A BIT OF PRECIPITATION. AS YOU KNOW IT'S THE WINTER MONTHS FROM DECEMBER THROUGH FEBRUARY THAT NORMALLY PROVIDE HALF OF CALIFORNIA'S ANNUAL PRECIPITATION. AND IT'S THE PRIMARY TIME PERIOD FOR THE GROWTH OF OUR SNOW PACK. US SO FAR FOR THIS WATER YEAR OF THIS WINTER RANKS IN THE BOTTOM TEN AND WETNESS AND IN THE TOP TEN IN WARMTH. CONDITIONS ARE DRIER STILL IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WHERE MANY BASINS HAVE ACCUMULATED ONLY TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THEIR NORMAL PRECIPITATION. STREAM FLOW IS ALSO BELOW NORMAL TWO DO TO THE VERY DRY WINTER. OUR SNOW PACK IS CURRENTLY ABOUT A ONE THIRD JUST OVER ONE THIRD THIRTY FIVE PERCENT. OF AN AVERAGE WINTER SNOWPACK AND THAT NORMALLY PEAKS ON THE FIRST OF APRIL. PLEASE TRY CONDITIONS ARE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LAST YEAR'S ABUNDANT PRECIPITATION. WE HAVE A LOT OF WATER IN STORAGE WITH THE EXCEPTION OF OF ORVILLE AT WHICH WE'VE OPERATED AT AN ARTIFICIALLY LOW LEVEL THAN WE WOULD OTHERWISE TYPICALLY DO. HISTORICALLY THERE HAVE BEEN INSTANCES WHERE A WET MARCH I REALLY OFFSETS A DRY CONDITIONS LEADING UP TO IT. FOR THIS PARTICULAR YEAR WHILE OF THE FIRST TWO WEEKS OF MARCH HAVE BEEN WET. IT'S UNLIKELY THAT WE'RE GOING TO REPEAT THE MIRACLE MARCH OF THE NINETEEN NINETIES THAT BROUGHT US OUT OF THAT DROUGHT. BUT. WE DO WELCOME THE PRECIPITATION IT'S POSSIBLE THAT. OUT. TWO MORE WEEKS OF WET WEATHER WILL BRING US OUT OF THAT BOTTOM TEN DRIVE WATER YEARS BUT IT'S JUST SIMPLY TOO SOON TO TELL. WITH THAT. REGARDLESS OF WHAT THE SPRING ULTIMATELY PROVIDES THE DEPARTMENT'S GOING TO CONTINUE TO TRACK THOSE HYDROLOGICAL CONDITIONS AS DEMAND FOR WATER PICKS UP. AND WE ALWAYS ENCOURAGE CALIFORNIANS TO CONTINUE CONTINUE TO CONSERVE OUR WATER RESOURCES. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE THESE BRIEF OF OF OVERARCHING COMMENTS UNLESS YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS I HAVE WITH ME. OUR NEW DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR THE STATE WATER PROJECTS AND OUR DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR FLOOD PROTECTION AND INTEGRATED REGIONAL WATER MANAGEMENT WITH ME TO DESCRIBE. BUDGET PROPOSALS IN MORE DETAIL. DON'T GIVE UP PLEASE PROCEED. BUT A GOOD AFTERNOON ERIC COPE WITH THE DEPARTMENT. I'LL BE ADDRESSING ISSUES EIGHT AND NINE. AND I THINK YOU'LL TAKE UP NUMBER TEN. THE ISSUE IT IS A PROPOSAL REQUESTING A TOTAL OF THREE POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS VARIOUS BOND FUNDS. TO CLOSE OUT A LOCAL ASSISTANCE GRANT PROGRAM RELATED TO FLUTTERS REDUCTION. THAT FACILITATE MORE EFFECTIVE TRIBAL PARTICIPATION IN INTEGRATED WATER MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS. BUT QUARTER GRANT PROGRAM WAS ORIGINALLY ESTABLISHED IN TWO THOUSAND TO HELP FUND PROJECTS STATEWIDE THAT EXPAND. PLUG CORRIDORS AND PRESERVE AGRICULTURAL AND OR WILDLIFE HABITAT. PROPOSAL REQUESTS A REAPPROPRIATION OF TWO MILLION DOLLARS AT A NEWS PROPOSITION FIFTY FOUR FUNDS THAT ALREADY EARMARKED IN THE BARN LOFT FOR THIS TYPE OF PROGRAM. THIS IS AND HAS BEEN IT'S SUCCESSFUL AND WELL RECEIVED PROGRAM OVER THE YEARS. WE'RE REQUESTING THESE REMAINING FUNDS TO ADD TO EXISTING FUNDS FOR A FINAL LE GRAND SOLICITATION PROPOSAL. LATER THIS YEAR. THE PROPOSAL ALSO REQUESTS FIVE AND THIRTY THOUSAND THE PROPOSITION THIRTEEN FUNDS TO SUPPORT STAFF. WHILE WE DO THAT SOLICITATION AND CLOSE OUT THE PROGRAM. IN ADDITION THIS PROPOSAL REQUEST SIX HUNDRED EIGHTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS OVER TWO YEARS FOR GRANTS OR CONTRACTS TO FACILITATE INCREASED PARTICIPATION. BY TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS OR COMMUNITIES AND REGIONAL WATER MANAGEMENT GROUPS. I'M ADDITIONAL OUR REGION ASSISTANCE IS NEEDED TO BUILD COLLABORATION. AND THE CAPACITY FOR THE TRIBES TO PARTICIPATE IN OUR PROGRAMS. FUNDS MAY ALSO INCREASE OPPORTUNITIES FOR TRIBAL COMMUNITIES TO ADVANCE PROJECTS THAT MEET THE WATER MANAGEMENT NEEDS OF THOSE COMMUNITIES. SO THAT WAS ISSUE EIGHT. ISSUE NINE IS IN REGARDS TO THE SAN JOAQUIN RIVER RESTORATION PROGRAM. THAT'S. SAN JOAQUIN RIVER REST REST OR A RIVER PROPOSALS COVER THREE YEAR. OF TIME PERIOD I REQUEST SIFTING POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN REIMBURSEMENT AUTHORITY. TO RECEIVE FUNDS FROM THE CALIFORNIA NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY AND FIVE POINT TWO MILLION A REIMBURSEMENT AUTHORITY TO. FOR FUNDS TO RUBY RECEIVED FROM THE WILDLIFE CONSERVATION BOARD WORK TO BE ACCOMPLISHED BY THE DEPARTMENT. THESE FUNDS WILL BE USED TO CONTINUE TO IMPLEMENT A COURT APPROVED SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT TO RESTORE THE HUNDRED FIFTY MILE REACH OF SAN JOAQUIN RIVER TO HELP RETURN. MY MIGRATORY SALMON TO THE RIVER SYSTEM. THIS WILL HELP. TO CONTINUE THAT RESTORATION WORK AND MAINTAIN FISH POPULATIONS IN THE MAIN STEM OF THE SAN JOAQUIN RIVER. AND AT THE SAME TIME REDUCE OR AVOID ANY. ADVERSE FLOOD RISKS AS WELL AS IMPROVE THE PARKWAY HABITAT AREAS IN THE FRESNO AREA. AND THAT'S ALL I HAD ON THOSE TWO ITEMS. PICK YOU WE HAVE OF SOME NOT. COMMENTS ON ISSUE TEN. YEAH. AFTER. GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK TO YOU TODAY BUT A JOLA DESMOND STATE WATER PROJECT DEPUTY DIRECTOR SINCE JULY. OUR REQUEST FOR THE SEVENTY FOUR POSITIONS ARE THE BASIC CORE IS JUST AGING INFRASTRUCTURE AND AND PUTTING US IN A POSITION THAT WE CAN MODERNIZE AND SUSTAIN. THE STATE WATER PROJECTS SO THAT IT CAN MEET ITS WRITTEN NEEDED RELIABILITY AND PUBLIC SAFETY. SO OUT OF THAT WE'RE REQUESTING POSITIONS TO. BE ABLE TO HANDLE ALL THE ENGINEERING AND THE STUDIES THAT ARE REQUIRED FOR THE AGING INFRASTRUCTURES DAM SAFETY BEING A. BIG COMPONENT OF THAT BUT NO DIFFERENT THEN THE ACT WOULD DUCT PIPELINES ROTATING EQUIPMENT SUCH AS THE PUMPS AND GENERATORS REQUIRED TO MOVE WATER. SO THESE POSITIONS WILL ULTIMATELY BE FOR ENGINEERING DESIGN AND THEN A LARGE POOR AND THEN A PORTION OF IT. ABOUT TWENTY ONE POSITIONS OR FOR A NEW OR AVAIL. OROVILLE CONSTRUCTION OFFICE NOT THAT IT WILL BE A NEW OROVILLE A RESERVE OR YOU KNOW SPILLWAY CONSTRUCTION ONLY OFFICE IT'S AN OFFICE TO HANDLE. CONSTRUCTION IN THE NORTHERN PART OF THAT THE STATE THERE ARE DAMS ABOVE ORVILLE AND THAT NO OROVILLE ITSELF AND IN SOME OF THE REGION OFFICES AND INCLUDING FLOOD. SO THAT OFFICES WILL ALLOW US TO HAVE A CONSTRUCTION OFFICE IN THIS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. TO HANDLE THE PROJECT DOWN THERE ONE IN SACRAMENTO WOOD HANDLES THE SACRAMENTO'S. SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY TYPE PROJECTS AND THEN ORVILLE. NOW THE OTHER POSITIONS ARE FOR A YOU KNOW THE ENGINEERING DESIGN DAM SAFETY WE DO HAVE NEW AND. REQUIREMENTS ON THAT FROM DE SO DE AND FOR. SO THAT ALONE IS GOING TO IS GOING TO RESULT IN MORE DANCE SAFETY PROJECTS BUT ON OUR PLATE TODAY WE HAVE ALREADY SUBSIDES WORK WE'RE DOING ON THE ACT WITHOUT PIPELINE ASSESSMENTS TO DO AND CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS THERE. SO THESE THESE ARE POSITIONS ARE CORE TO OUR MISSION OF TRYING TO SUSTAIN THE STATE WATER PROJECT AND PUBLIC SAFETY. GREAT THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS SET UP PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUES O. AYE THROUGH THAT'S FOR LA OPENING MOMENTS FAVORITE AND THAT STEP FORWARD IF YOU HAVE PUBLIC COMMENT WILL. WILL BE GETTING TO YOU JUST A SECOND SAVAGES EIGHT NINE A CONTINUATIONS OF EXISTING ACTIVITIES WE DON'T HAVE ANY CONCERNS FAIR THIS ISSUE TEN I THINK WE DREW THE SAME CONCLUSIONS AS IS NOTED IN YOUR STAFF. OCT COMMENTS WHERE CLEARLY THERE'S THERE'S WORKLOAD FOR THE STATE WATER PROJECT FROM AGING INFRASTRUCTURE AND AND INCREASE DAM SAFETY REQUIREMENTS GENERALLY THE WORKLOAD SEEM REASONABLE I THINK ARE ARE ONLY QUESTIONS WERE REALLY. AS REFLECTING YOUR STAFF COMMENTS ABOUT THE TIMING OF THE WORK IN THE OROVILLE AREA RELATED TO THE FOR CREE LICENSING THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT SO HOLDING THIS OPEN WILL ALLOW YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON. THE PROGRESS OF THOSE AGREEMENTS OVER THE COMING MONTHS. THANK YOU BERMAN FINANCE THAT THINK SO I WILL HEAR PUBLIC COMMENT NOW. CRAZY THOMPSON WITH THE STATE WATER CONTRACTORS. FOR THIS PARTICULAR BUDGET ITEM THE STATE WATER CONTRACTORS ARE GENERALLY IN SUPPORT FOR ITEM NUMBER TEN. BUT WE DO SUPPORT THAT RECOMMENDATION TO KEEP THE ITEM OPENED TO LOOK AT LONGER SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE OUR DIALOGUE WITH YOU TO. WORK THROUGH THE STAFFING AS WELL AS THE TIMING OF THE STAFF AT AS WHETHER BE PERMANENT SHORT TERM AND AT. JUST THE OVERALL NEED SO AND AGAIN SUPPORT THE OVER ARCHING NEED AT THAT PROPOSAL BAD WE ASK FOR MORE TIME THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS STEVE BAKER WITH THEIR IN WRITTEN ASSOCIATES REPRESENTING THE PROFESSIONAL ENGINEERS IN CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT WE REPRESENT THE ENGINEERS THAT WORK AT THEIR APARTMENT AND WE AGREE WITH THE. ADMINISTRATION THAT THERE ARE ADDITIONAL ENGINEERING POSITIONS NEEDED TO DO THE A DM SAFETY INSPECTIONS AND CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT. AND DESIGN OF THE AGING INFRASTRUCTURE AND FOR THIS REASON SUPPORT THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ALL HAVE AS WE WILL HOLD THAT OPENED UP ALL THOSE ITEMS OPEN AS WE TRANSITION TO OUR NEXT ITEM ISSUE ELEVEN. THERE ARE ABOUT A HUNDRED PEOPLE OUTSIDE WHO ARE I THINK MOST OF THEM WAITING FOR ISSUE TWELFTH. BUT IF YOU'RE. FINISHED WITH YOUR BUSINESS HERE TODAY I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE ROOM FOR AS MANY OF THEM AS POSSIBLE. YOU DON'T HAVE TO BELIEVE IF YOU DON'T WANT TO. AND TO A. SO WITH THIS SIR. ISSUE ELEVEN I'M HOPING TO UNDERSCORE THE DIRE WATER CHALLENGES IN THE STATE. OF THAT WEEK THAT WE FACE THAT SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER PROPOSAL WHICH IS BEING CONSIDERED BY THE SUBCOMMITTEE. SEEKS TO RESOLVE SIMILAR WATER CHALLENGES HOWEVER IT WOULD NOT SOLVE MANY OF THE ASSOCIATED IMMEDIATE NEEDS MANY COMMUNITIES CONTINUE TO SUFFER FROM DRIED WELLS. AND FAILING SEPTIC SYSTEMS AND I'D LIKE TO INVITE A FEW STAKEHOLDERS INVOLVED AND AFFECTED BY THIS CRISIS TO PRESENT ON THIS ISSUE OF OUR YVES RT SET DOWN WE HAVE. JESSE US NEITHER WITHOUT SELF HELP ENTERPRISES. STEPHANIE BA I GUESS WITH THE RURAL COMMUNITY ASSISTANCE CORPORATION. AND TO. SUSAN QUEEN A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE COMMUNITY THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE PLEASE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. MY NAME AGAIN IS JESSIE SNYDER AND WITH SELF HELP ENTERPRISES AND WHERE COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING ORGANIZATION THAT SERVES THE EIGHT COUNTIES OF THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. AND WE'RE HERE TO STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS BUDGET REQUEST FOR SOME EMERGENCY. WATER FUNDS TO SUPPORT IT A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT EFFORTS. SOUTH OF ENTERPRISES HAS BEEN ONE OF THE PRIMARY ORGANIZATIONS RESPONDING TO DROUGHT CONDITIONS IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY THROUGH PARTNERSHIPS WITH STATE OH YES AND LOCAL OAS AGENCIES. AND AFTER THE CALIFORNIA DISASTER ASSISTANCE ACT FUNDING AND DID AS A RESULT OF THE DROUGHT BEING DECLARED OVER WE TOOK OVER MOST OF THOSE PROGRAMS DIRECTLY. WE'VE BEEN RECEIVING FUNDS FOR THE PAST TWELVE MONTHS. TO CONTINUE TO FILL EMERGENCY WATER TANKS THAT ARE AN INTERIM SOLUTION THAT ALLOW FOLKS LIKE SUSAN QUEEN SITTING TO MY LEFT HERE TO STAY IN THEIR HOMES WHILE THEY WORK TOWARD A PERMANENT SOLUTION. THE CURRENT FUNDING ENDS JUNE THIRTIETH WHERE BARELY GOING TO CRAWL ACROSS THE FINISH LINE WITH SUFFICIENT FUNDS. ARE TO CONTINUE TO SERVE THE FOLKS WHO STILL NEED THOSE TANKS SO I'M HERE ASKING FOR A AN ADDITIONAL ALLOCATION OF FUNDS FOR THIS COMING YEAR TO CONTINUE TO FILL THOSE ESSENTIAL. INTERIM WATER TANKS. I IN ADDITION WE'RE WORKING TO REPLACE THOSE FAILED WATER WELLS AND WHETHER THAT'S WITH NEW WELLS OR CONNECTIONS TO COMMUNITY SYSTEMS WHETHER EXISTING OR NEW. THAT'S A VERY EXPENSIVE PROPOSAL AND IT TAKES A LOT OF TIME WORKING THROUGH IT FAMILY BY FAMILY. AND. AS OF JUNE THIRTIETH. WE WILL STILL HAVE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FAMILIES ON OUR WAITING LIST FOR FUNDING AND WE ARE CURRENTLY OVERSUBSCRIBED WE DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH FUNDING TO MEET THE CURRENT LEVEL OF NEED. AND THAT'S IF WE DON'T GET ADDITIONAL APPLICATIONS WHICH I'M SURE WE WILL BECAUSE WELLS DO CONTINUE TO FAIL. SO I'M ALSO HERE TO REQUEST FUNDING TO HELP WITH. REPLACING THOSE WATER WELLS AS WELL AS RESPONDING TO SEPTIC TANK EMERGENCIES WHICH PRESENTE TERRIBLE PUBLIC HEALTH HAZARD. AND ARE OFTEN EXPERIENCED BY THE VERY SAME PEOPLE WHO EXPERIENCE WELL FAILURES. I LIKE TO PASS THE BATON NOW TO SUSAN QUEEN TO MY LEFT TO TULARE COUNTY RESIDENTS LIVING IN THE CITY OF PORTABLE. BOB I THOUGHT SUSAN QUEEN I LIVE VIA IN PORTABLE SOUTH OF THE CITY LIMITS I'M NOT IN THE CITY. I'D WANT TO PUT A FACE ON A PERSON WHO WENT TO WASH OUR HANDS AND THERE WAS NO WATER AND HAS THAT BEEN ANY SINCE AUGUST OF TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN. UMMM I IMMEDIATELY APPLIED AND GOT HELP OUT WATER. OF TOOK ABOUT TWO MONTHS TO GET THE TANK AND THEY BEGIN GIVING ME AND NOT THEY GIVE THE AT THE AT THAT TIME WERE ALLOCATED FIFTY GALLONS PER DAY PER PERSON. AND THAT WAS A STABLE. ITEM. THEY HAVE SINCE WHEN THEY WHEN INTO THEM. AND HANDED OVER TO SELF HELP ITSELF HELP DIDN'T HAVE THE FUNDS DID TO MAINTAIN THAT THEY DROPPED US TO THIRTY GALLONS A DAY. THAT IS BARELY SUSTAINABLE. I LOST ALL MY PLANTS OUTSIDE OF LOS I TRY TO KEEP TREE ALIVE I. JUST YOU CAN'T WATCH IT EXPLODED CLOSE I MEAN IT'S IT'S BARELY. MAKING IT. I'M. I HAVE BEEN WAITING BECAUSE I'VE BEEN TOLD SINCE THE BEGINNING THAT THERE ARE GRANTS. POSSIBLE TO DEEPEN MY WELL ARE TOOK UP TO A M.. ANTIQUE WELL I LIVE IN A MIKE GREAT UNCLES PARENTS HOUSE BILL EIGHTEEN EIGHTIES AND THERE'S SOME THINGS ON THE PROPERTY THAT HAVE BEEN USED FOR DARN NEAR THAT LONG. AND. SO I BEEN WAITING BECAUSE I DIDN'T I DON'T HAVE FUNDS SO I DIDN'T WANNA TAKE OUT THE LOAN AND HAVE IT. DONE AND THEN FIND OUT THERE WAS A GRAND ABIDE WAITED. AND NOW I'M IN DEBT WHEN MY KIDS AGAIN PAID OFF. SO I THAT'S MY BIGGEST THING IS JUST TO ACTUALLY PUT A FACE ON A PERSON AND I ASK YOU IN ALL OF YOUR FUNDING. PLEASE PUT PEOPLE FIRST. I KNOW WE JUST HAD A LOT OF OTHER ISSUES WITH ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES WOULD LOVE THE ENVIRONMENT WE LOVE THE ANIMALS BUT. I JUST WANT THE COMMITTEE TO THINK OF PEOPLE AND THEIR IMMEDIATE NEEDS AB WATERS PRETTY BIG ONE. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON AMBER CARE WITH DO YOU RURAL COMMUNITY ASSISTANCE CORPORATION. THANK YOU FOR HAVING US THIS AFTERNOON I JUST WANNA GIVE YOU A BRIEF HISTORY OF WHAT OUR CECE'S BEEN DOING. HISTORICALLY TO HELP WITH THIS PROBLEM. WE ORIGINALLY GOT FUNDED IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN WITH THE CALIFORNIA ENDOWMENT. IN PARTNERSHIP WITH OTHER MY OTHER AGENCIES IS WALL TO FIND A PILOT PROGRAM TO CREATE A. I'M WATER BOTTLE FILLING STATION ACCESS AND WATER QUALITY. PROGRAM FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THE ORIGINAL PILOT PROGRAM WAS IN KERN COUNTY AND. TULARE COUNTY. I'M I'M SORRY KERN COUNTY RIVERSIDE COUNTY AND WE'VE CENTS. MOVED TO. I'M EXPAND THE PROGRAM STATEWIDE. PART OF THE CURRENT SITUATION WITH ITS CURRENT DRINKING WATER IN SCHOOLS FUNDING WE HAVE MOVED TO SIX COUNT SIXTEEN COUNTIES INCLUDING SISKIYOU FROM OUR NORTHERN BORDER ALTHOUGH IT'S IMPERIAL AT OUR SOUTHERN BORDER. I'M TWENTY SEVEN SCHOOL DISTRICTS FIFTY SEVEN SCHOOLS AND WE'RE CURRENTLY SERVING SEVENTEEN THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED THIRTY STUDENTS WITH THAT PROGRAM. THIS PROGRAM IMPLANTS WATER QUALITY AND ACCESS IS CHEAP ISSUES TO THE SCHOOL SITES AND HOPES TO FUND WHAT BOTH FILLING STATIONS WATER QUALITY IN TERMS SOLUTIONS. EXAGGERATES HELP SUPPORT THOSE SCHOOLS. AND ACCESS REFERS TO THE NEED TO ADDRESS WATER INFRASTRUCTURE IN SCHOOLS CONDITIONS ADA COMPLIANCE AND SOME SITES INSTALLING WATER FOUNTAINS FOR THE FIRST TIME. ARE UNMET NEEDS. ARE AS FOLLOWS. NEW MANDATORY LEAD TESTING IS GREAT STEP FORWARD BUT WHAT TO SCHOOLS DO WHEN THEY FIND THE PROBLEMS WHERE THEY DO WHEN THEY FIND THE CONTAMINATION. I'M CURRENTLY OF THEIR AUTHORS VERY LITTLE FUNDING TO MOVE TO IMPLEMENTATION TO IN TERM SOLUTIONS AND TO LONG TERM SOLUTIONS. LARGER DISTRICTS ARE OPT TO USE MOST OF THIS THIS CURRENT FUNDING. I'M THERE WILL STILL BE A NEED FOR SMALL DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES TO CONTINUE TO BE FUNDED. ANOTHER UNDERFUNDED ISSUE IS THE EDUCATION AND OUTREACH WE CONTINUE TO SEE THAT THERE'S A LOT OF SCHOOLS THAT AREN'T. I'M APPLYING FOR THIS PROGRAM THEY'RE NOT GETTING THE WORD OUT. THERE'S THEY HAVE LOW STAFF SO THERE'S NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO GO OUT AND SEEK FUNDING LIKE MUCH SMALL MUCH LARGER DISTRICTS HAVE THE THE ABILITY TO DO. SO HAVING A HARD TIME ACTUALLY GETTING OUT THERE AND AND LETTING THE SCHOOLS KNOW THAT THIS FUNDING IS AVAILABLE. SO WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME. YOU KNOW COLD CALLING CALLING SCHOOLS DIRECTLY IN LETTING THEM KNOW THAT THIS FUNDING IS AVAILABLE AND HELPING THEM TO GET ACCESS TO THE CURRENT FUNDING. IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE CONTINUE WITH THE DIRECT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO REACH OUT TO THESE COMMUNITIES TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE ISSUES GET SOLVED. MAKE IT. UP GOOD MORNING OR GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR BLOOM AND HONORABLE MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE. MY NAME IS EILEEN SO BACK I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD. I'M AND WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK TO YOU TODAY. ABOUT THIS INFORMATION ITEM AND THE THREE TOPICS. YOU'VE LOST A. FOR. SUMP DATES IN PROGRESS. ON WHAT THE STATE WATER PORTS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO. SO WITH RESPECT TO EMERGENCY DRINKING WATER SINCE THE DECLARATION OF THE DROUGHT EMERGENCY AND TWENTY FOURTEEN THE STATE WATER BOARD HAS FUNDED TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT EMERGENCY DRINKING WATER PROJECTS. THE TOTAL COST OF AROUND FORTY MILLION DOLLARS TO ADDRESS BOTH WATER SORT SHORTAGES AND CONTAMINATION. OF THE PROJECTS THAT WERE FUNDED INCLUDED WELL RIP REPAIR AND REPLACEMENT HOLD WATER. EMERGENCY INNER TIES TREATMENT SYSTEMS AND BOTTLED WATER. DURING THE DROUGHT WE COORDINATED OUR FUNDING EFFORTS CLOSELY WITH DEPARTMENT OF EMERGENCY SERVICES AND PART OF WATER RESOURCES. AND WE REALLY WANT TO SHOUT OUT LOCAL AGENCIES IN OUR NONPROFIT TIME PARTNERS IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE I'M COMMUNITY THEY WERE ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL TO IDENTIFYING SPECIFIC NEEDS. AND TO PROVIDE AND THE ACTUAL FUNDING TO THE IMPACTED. COMMUNITIES AND HOUSEHOLDS AND INEFFICIENT. AND FAIR MANNER. I'M IN SOME COMMUNITIES THE NEED FOR BOTTLED WATER OR HAULED WATER HAS BEEN AND WILL BE ONGOING FOR MANY YEARS. I'M. PERMANENT SOLUTIONS. BASS A NUMBER OF CHALLENGES SUCH AS THE COMPLEX CONSOLIDATION PROPHECIES AND THE LACK OF TECHNICAL MANAGERIAL OR FINANCIAL CAPACITY OF COMMUNITIES. TO OPERATE AND MAINTAIN SYSTEMS A CHAIR MARCUS IS GOING TO TOUCH ON ON ON THESE ISSUES IN THE NEXT PRESENTATION I'M COMING BEFORE YOU. UP TODAY. TO SUPPORT TIME SMALL WATER SYSTEMS AND INDIVIDUAL HOUSEHOLDS AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES OF THE STATE WATER BOARD STARTED A PROGRAM TO PROVIDE WELL REPLACEMENT AND REPAIR. FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN GRANT FUNDS TO THREE NON PROFITS AND TWENTY SIXTEEN. AND WE RECENTLY PUT AN ADDITIONAL FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TOWARD PORTS THAT PROGRAM. FROM TWENTY SEVENTEEN BUDGET ELECT BUDGET ACT GENERAL FUNDS ON THAT WERE APPROPRIATE FOR THAT PURPOSE. I'M YOU'VE HEARD TODAY FROM THE NON PROFITS ABOUT AND WHAT THE DEMAND I'M FOR THOSE FUNDS TIME HAS BEEN. WELL THE CLEAN UP AN ABATEMENT FUN CAN BE USED TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE ONGOING URGENT DRINKING WATER NEEDS. THAT ACCOUNT IS USED TO FUND OTHER IMPORTANT. PROJECTS THAT INCLUDES AND. PROJECTS TO ADDRESS WATER QUALITY IMPACTS DO DUE TO RECENT WILD FLOWER FIRE WILD FIRES IN OUR STATE. I'M SHOULD THERE BE ANOTHER DROUGHT OR ANY OTHER UNFORESEEN EMERGENCY. SITUATIONS IT MAY BE DIFFICULT FOR US TO TO MEET ALL EMERGENCY NEEDS FROM THE CLEAN UP AN ABATEMENT ACCOUNT. TURNING TO THE ISSUE EVERY PARENT REPLACEMENT A FAILING SEPTIC SYSTEMS. STATE WATER BOARD AGREES THAT SUCH SYSTEMS AND CAN BE A SIGNIFICANT GROUND WATER QUALITY PROGRAM. AND PUBLIC HEALTH HEALTH THREAT. IN FACT IN TWENTY TWELVE WE ADOPTED THEM EIGHT. A. THE ON SITE WASTE WATER TREATMENT SYSTEM POLICY. TO PROVIDE THE POLICY AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR ADDRESSING THOSE THREATS. I'M IT FORMALIZES A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LOCAL AGENCIES AND OUR REGIONAL WATER BECAUSE WATER. QUALITY CONTROL BOARDS AND ESTABLISHES MONITORING REQUIREMENTS TO DEVELOP A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE SYSTEMS IMPACTS ON WATER QUALITY. AND TO ALLOW WHAT LOCAL AGENCIES TO COME UP WITH A PLAN. THAT WE ARE STILL IN THE. PROCESS OF. DEVELOPING A COMPREHENSIVE NEEDS ASSESSMENT BUT NEVER THE LESS THE STATE WATER BOARD HAS PROVIDED FUNDING TO CONVERT INDIVIDUAL SEPTIC SYSTEMS. TO CENTRALIZE WAIT WASTEWATER COLLECTION AND TREATMENT SYSTEMS AND SEVERAL COMMUNITIES. OUR FUNDING FOR THIS PROGRAM IS AVAILABLE THROUGH BOTH ARE CLEAN WATER STATE CLEAN WATER STATE REVOLVING FUND. AND PROPOSITION ONE GRANT DOLLARS. UP FINALLY ON. THE LAST ISSUE WE WERE ASKED TO DISCUSS IS OUR DRINKING WATER FOR SCHOOLS PROGRAM AS YOU KNOW. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THE LEGISLATURE PROVIDED NINE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO ESTABLISH THE DRINKING WATER FOR SCHOOLS PROGRAM. AN ADDITIONAL HALF MILLION DOLLARS TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR APPLICANTS. THIS PROGRAM IS DIFFERENT FOR US BECAUSE IT INVOLVES NOT ONLY. ON PROVIDING SAFE WATER FOR SCHOOLS BUT ALSO. EXCEPT HOW ACCESSIBLE THE WATER IS FOR STUDENTS. SO WE ADOPTED GUIDELINES IN MAY TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND HER AND BEGAN THE PROCESS FOR SOLICITING PROJECTS IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN. WE'VE CONDUCTED I'M WORKSHOPS AND. OUTREACH SINCE WE HAVE TIME. RESERVE THIS INITIAL APPLICATION PERIOD FOR US SMALL DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES WHICH HAVE THE MOST CHALLENGE. AND PUTTING TOGETHER AND GRANTS AND PROPOSALS AS HAS BEEN NOTED. AND WE. HAVE. ASSIGNED TWENTY SIX TECHNICAL I'M. ASSISTANCE AND. I RESPONDED TO TWENTY SIX TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE REQUESTS IN ORDER TO FACILITATE ARM PROPOSALS BY THOSE I'M ENTITIES. WE EXPECT THE FIRST APPLICATIONS FOR FUNDING TOOK A BRIBE THIS MONTH. WE'RE SEEING AN INCREASE IN REQUESTS FOR BOTTLED WATER FROM SCHOOLS AS A RESULT OF TESTING. TESTING RESULTS FOR ONE TWO THREE TCP AND LETTER COMING IN. AND AS WE. AS WE MOVE FURTHER FURTHER AND FURTHER AND THAT PROCESS WE AND EXPECT. THAT MORE SCHOOLS WILL NEED TO TREAT FOR LEAD CONTAMINATION. SINCE THIS PROGRAM IS JUST GETTING STARTED AND THE EXTENT OF THE POTENTIAL CONNECT CONTAMINATIONS XIN CONCERNS ARE JUST BEING IDENTIFIED WE DO NOT YET HAVE A CLEAR AND NOTION OF THE DEMANDS BUT I I THINK WE ALL KNOW THAT. THEY ARE THERE. THANK YOU AND FOR YOUR TIME AND ATTENTION AND WE'RE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. PICK YOU THINK YOU FOR THE VERY ILLUMINATING PRESENTATIONS ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE DICE. I'M I'VE JUST LEARNED THAT OF THERE'S ANOTHER COMMITTEE THAT EXPECTS TO HAVE THIS ROOM IN ABOUT TEN MINUTES WERE TRYING TO WORK THAT OUT. I AND I WANT TO MOVE AS EXPEDITIOUSLY. FORWARD AS WE CAN INTO OUR NEXT ITEM IS THERE ANY PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS INFORMATIONAL ITEM. THANK A OKAY. WE DO HAVE A LITTLE. KEEP YOUR COMMENTS AS CONCISE AS POSSIBLE I KNOW YOU WANNA BE HEARD ON THE NEXT ISSUE TO. JONATHAN NELSON BEHALF OF THE COMMUNITY WATER CENTER IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS BUDGET ITEM IS A COMPLIMENT TO THE NEXT ITEM THINKING. MY CLAIBORNE OF LEADERSHIP A SHIP COUNSEL AND STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS ITEM AND JUST WANTED TO NOTE THAT THAT DROUGHT ISN'T OVER IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY WORKING WITH NEARLY DRY WELLS AND CARRUTHERS AND FRESNO COUNTY SO THERE'S A NEED THANKS. SHE ONLY FLAYED GOING HEAR REPRESENTING POLICY LINK ALSO IN STRONG SUPPORT I AM ALSO HERE TODAY REPRESENTING MYSELF AS A PARENT YOU KNOW YOU S. THE WHERE WE HAVE HAD A SERIOUS LEAD PROBLEM IN OUR SCHOOLS. AND WE KNOW THIS. PROPOSAL IS A DROP IN THE BUCKET COMPARED TO WHAT WE EXPECT SCHOOLS WILL NEED. BUT WOULD REALLY LIKE TO SEE. SAFE DRINKING WATER FOR ALL OF OUR CHILDREN HERE IN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR PRESENTATIONS SERVE VERY APPRECIATED AND VERY INFORMATIVE. OUR LAST ISSUE IS ISSUE TWELVE. WHEN WILL THIS DATA. HAD RIGHT INTO IT. BEARING IN MIND AGAIN THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF. OF PEOPLE WHO'D LIKE TO ADD THEIR COMMENTS. HONDA WHAT IS PROVEN TO BE A SOMEWHAT TRAVERSAL PROPOSAL FROM THE GOVERNOR. WELCOME DIRECTOR MARCUS GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN. YOU COULD MAKE. YOUR PRESENT A BEGIN YOUR PRESENTATION OF THE GREAT. TERRIFIC. WELL GOOD AFTERNOON HAPPY RAINY DAY. AND THE DAY IT'S RAINING IS A HAPPY DAY. AYE THEY ALSO IT'S PIE NAY WHICH IS TOTALLY ALSO AND I WON PRO THEIR. RIVER THAT MEANS. IT I'M VERY GLAD TO BE BACK FOR THIS NEXT PHASE IN OUR JOINT EFFORTS TO IMPROVE THE ACCESS OF ALL CALIFORNIANS TO CLEAN SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER. AND TO IMPLEMENT CALIFORNIA'S HUMAN RIGHT TO WATER POLICY. WITH ME TODAY IS GERM POLYGAMISTS ARE DEPUTY DIRECTOR% FOR THE DRINKING WATER PROGRAM WHO IS A VETERAN DIRECTOR OF OUR DIVISION OF FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. AND WE ALSO HAVE OTHERS IN THE AUDIENCE TO ASSIST WITH YOUR QUESTIONS INCLUDING LESLIE LOUDON THE CURRENT DIRECTOR WHO YOU JUST SAW. SINCE PASSAGE OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS WATER ACT IN YOUR DIRECTION TO AGENCIES TO CONSIDER THAT POLICY AND ALL THAT WE DO WE'VE MADE SOME SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS. WITH YOUR HELP. AS YOU KNOW OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS THE LEGISLATURE WORKED WITH THE GOVERNOR HAS PROVIDED THE BOARD WITH NEW TOOLS AND AUTHORITIES. TO ADDRESS SAFE DRINKING WATER PROBLEMS. STARTING IN JULY TWENTY FOURTEEN TRANSFERRING THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE SAFE DRINKING WATER PROGRAM FROM THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH TO THE STATE WATER BOARD. TO ALLOW FOR ONE AGENCY TO BE RESPONSIBLE SOURCE TO TAP DIVIDE ONE STOP SHOPPING FOR COMMUNITIES PARTICULARLY DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. FOR THEIR FUNDING NEEDS AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. SINCE THAT TIME FOR EXAMPLE THE PROP ONE CAPITAL FUNDING FOR DRINKING WATER AND WASTEWATER TREATMENT FOR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND THE ABILITY TO USE THOSE DOLLARS FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AS WELL. THE CREATION OF THE OFFICE OF SUSTAINABLE WATER SOLUTIONS TO FOCUS ON DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND THEIR NEEDS. THE AUTHORITY TO ORDER CONSOLIDATION OF SMALL SYSTEMS WITH LARGER SYSTEMS AND THE TOOLS TO HELP WITH VOLUNTARYCONSOLIDATION. LIMITATIONS ON THE ABILITY. CREATE THE PROLIFERATION OF NEW CYSTS SMALLER SYSTEMS. THE ABILITY TO HELP PROVIDE DRINKING WATER ASSISTANCE TO SMALLER COMMUNITIES IN DOMESTIC WELL OWNERS IN CERTAIN CASES. PARTICULARLY GOING TO THE DROUGHT EAST PORTABLE IS PERHAPS THE BEST EXAMPLE OF THIS AND ONE WHERE WE NOW HAVE STE CLEAN SAFE DRINKING WATER FLOWING INTO HUNDREDS OF HOMES. THAT WITHOUT WATER AND ALL DURING THE DROUGHT LET ALONE WITHOUT CLEAN WATER FOR MUCH LONGER TIME. AND YOU GAVE US THE ABILITY BUT NOT YET THE FUNDING TO HIRE AN ADMINISTRATOR TO MANAGE COMMUNITY WATER SYSTEMS. THAT SIMPLY LACK THE MANAGERIAL TECHNICAL OR FINANCIAL ABILITY TO MANAGE THOSE TREATMENT FACILITY SO THANK YOU SO MUCH. FOR ALL OF THAT AND BECAUSE OF THOSE WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO HELP MANY COMMUNITIES AND ARE IN THE PROCESS OF HELPING MORE MANY MORE. WE SPEND ABOUT SIX HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT MILLION IN GRANTS AND LOANS TO HELP SCORES OF DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. WILL CONTINUE TO USE THESE TOOLS IN COMBINATION AS WE CAN THERE MANY MORE WE CAN'T HELP. WITHOUT OR OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE FUNDING SOURCE. SO DESPITE OUR EFFORTS MANY LOCAL WATER SYSTEMS IN THE STATE PARTICULARLY SERVING SMALL DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. CONSISTENTLY FAIL TO PROVIDE SAFE DRINKING WATER THEIR CUSTOMERS AND WE HAVE OVER THREE HUNDRED SYSTEMS THAT ARE UNDER OUR BASIC JURISDICTION THAT'S. THOSE WHO SERVE OVER TWENTY FIVE FOR SIXTY DAYS OR MORE PER YEAR. WE'VE UNTIL MANY MORE THAT ARE SMALLER THAN THAT. IT FIT LETTER BELOW OUR TRADITIONAL LEGAL JURISDICTION OF COURSE WE HAVE MANY MORE WITH. DOMESTIC WELLS THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO HELP THOUSANDS MORE SINCE TWENTY FOURTEEN THAT WE COULD HAVE BEFORE. BUT IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS IN MANY MANY COMMUNITIES ALL ACROSS CALIFORNIA NOT JUST IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. STILL DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO CLEAN RELIABLE DRINKING WATER UP WHICH TOO MANY OF US IS THE PREEMINENT WATER ISSUE OF OUR TIME. AND ONE THAT WE AS CALIFORNIANS CAN ABSOLUTELY DO SOMETHING ABOUT. IT'S HEARTBREAKING AND THERE'S A LOT MORE WE CAN DO TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE AND HAVE A GREAT TEAM OF HIGHLY MOTIVATED AND TALENTED PEOPLE WHO ARE PASSIONATE ABOUT MAKING THAT DIFFERENCE. BUT WE CAN'T DO WITHOUT MORE HELP SO WE'RE BACK FOR THAT HELP. AS I'VE TAKEN PAINS TO FLAG EACH TIME I'VE BEEN HERE SINCE WE CONTEMPLATED BRINGING THE DRINKING WATER PROGRAM OVER. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT REMAINING CHALLENGE WILL BE THE LACK OF A STABLE FUNDING SOURCE FOR LONG TERM. OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE FOR DRINKING WATER SYSTEMS THIS CIRCUMSTANCE JUST SIMPLY LIMITS THE ABILITY TO ACCESS THE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL COSTS FOR HUNDREDS OF SMALL SYSTEMS AND DOMESTIC WELLS. AND THEY CAN'T BE CONSOLIDATED IT IT IT'S FOR LARGER SYSTEM BUT ALSO HINDERS OUR ABILITY TO CONSOLIDATE. COMMUNITIES CAN'T AFFORD TO MAINTAIN THEIR OWN SYSTEM AND THEY'RE CURRENTLY SERVING DRINKING WATER THAT DOESN'T MEET HEALTH STANDARDS. WILL MOVE AHEAD BECAUSE I KNOW THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE AND WE HAVE TO GO IN I KNOW YOU'VE LOOKED AT THIS ISSUE BEFORE. KEY THING THERE IS WITHOUT THE O. N. M. WE CAN'T USE THE ADMINISTRATOR AUTHORITY YOU'VE GIVEN US THAT NOT ONLY CAN HELP MANAGE. EXISTING SYSTEMS WE CAN HELP TO FACILITATE THE CONSOLIDATION PROJECT PROCESS WHICH WE WANT TO DO MUCH MORE OF. SO BACK TO ASK FOR HELP WITH THE BIGGEST MISSING PIECE WHICH IS TO MAKE. THE PUBLIC POLICY CHOICE AND IT IS A CHOICE. THAT WE IS CALIFORNIANS. ARE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER. AND THAT IS THE INTEREST OF ALL CALIFORNIANS TO ASSURE THAT WE ALL HAVE ACCESS. CLEAN SAFE AND AFFORDABLE WATER BY GIVING US THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE THAT STABLE FUNDING FOR OPERATION TO MAKE. TO ADDRESS THIS CHALLENGE THE GOVERNOR'S FISCAL YEAR TWENTY EIGHTEEN TWENTY NINETEEN BUDGET. CONTAINS TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE ESTABLISHING A NEW SPECIAL FUND FOR THE STATE WATER BOARD TO ASSIST COMMUNITIES PARTICULARLY DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES IN PAYING FOR SHORT TERM AND LONG TERM COSTS OF OBTAINING ACCESS TO SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER. THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING STATUTORY LANGUAGE CONSISTENT WITH THE POLICY FRAMEWORK OF S. B. SIX TWENTY THREE INTRODUCED IN THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN TO EIGHTEEN LEGISLATIVE SESSION. TO ESTABLISH A PROGRAM THAT PROVIDES GRANTS LOANS AND ADMINISTRATOR CONTRACTS OR SERVICES TO ASSIST ELIGIBLE COMMUNITIES AND HOUSEHOLDS IN SECURING ACCESS TO SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING. DRINKING WATER THAT WILL ALLOW US TO ACCELERATE OUR CONSOLIDATION AND OTHER EFFORTS. AND MOVE TOWARDS THE MOST EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE SOLUTIONS FOR THE MOST COMMUNITIES. PARTICULAR BUDGET PROPOSAL IS FOR FOUR POINT SEVEN MILLION IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN FOR THE STATE WATER BOARD IN THE DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE. TO TAKE OUR INITIAL STEPS TOWARDS IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS NEW PROGRAM. INCLUDING ONE pDEVELOPING AND IMPLEMENTING FEE COLLECTION SYSTEMS TO CONDUCTING AN ASSESSMENT TO ESTIMATE THE LEVEL OF FUNDING NEEDED TO ASSIST WATER SYSTEMS IN THE STATE. AND THREE DEVELOPING AND MAKING AVAILABLE A MAP OF HIGH RISK AQUIFER'S USES DRINKING WATER SOURCES TO BE ABLE TO TARGET OUR RESOURCES MOST EFFECTIVELY. YOU HAVE THE BILL BEFORE YOU AND YOUR STAFF SUMMARIES AND ALL THE OTHER FOLKS HERE SOMEWHAT SUMMARIZE ALL THE DETAIL. I'M JUST HOPING THAT TODAY YOU'LL HEAR BUSTED DISAGREEMENT ABOUT THE OBJECTIVE TO DO THIS TODAY. AND MORE PERHAPS ABOUT THE DETAILS WHICH I URGE YOU SIMPLY TO DECIDE AS SOON AS YOU POSSIBLY CAN. AND DECIDE TO MOVE FORWARD EVERY YEAR EVERY MONTH EVERY WEEK EVERY DAY WE GO WITHOUT THIS FUNDING PEOPLE CAN'T TURN ON THEIR TAPS WITHOUT FEARS THAT WE COULD HAVE HELPED. WITH THAT FUNDING. THERE'S A LOT MORE TO SAY AND A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T THINK IT'S WAITING TO SAY IT'S ALL STOP THERE AND I KNOW HAVE OVERDONE IT IN PREVIOUS I'M HEARING SO AS I SAID I. USED UP ALL MY LETTERS MAYBE TWO YEARS AGO I CAN'T REMEMBER WHEN THAT WAS SO HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY. QUESTIONS YOU HAVE OF COURSE ALONG WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND OTHERS THANK YOU FOR THE A PRESENTATION. WE HAVE US SOME COMMENTS FROM ALEJO. THANK YOU CHAU MIGHT WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND. WHO WITHIN THE LEGISLATURE FACES A POLICY DECISION HERE ABOUT WHETHER TO INCREASE CHARGES ON CERTAIN PRODUCTS AND CONSUMERS IN ORDER AND TO IMPLEMENT A NEW PROGRAM? AND WE'VE IDENTIFIED THREE ISSUES FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER AS IT DELIBERATES OVER IT THIS POLICY DECISION. ABOUT WHAT THE CONSISTENCY WITH THE STATE'S HUMAN RIGHT TO WATER POLICY. UNCERTAINTY MATT ESTIMATED REVENUES AND COSTS IN THE PROGRAM. AND ALSO CONSISTENCY WITH THE POLLUTER PAYS PRINCIPLE SOME SKIN GOV AT THESE BRIEFLY. I'M WE BELIEVE THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IS CONSISTENT WITH THIS STATE STATUTORY POLICY THAT EVERY HUMAN BEING HAS THE RIGHT TO SAFE CLEAN AFFORDABLE AND ACCESSIBLE WATER. FIVE FOR ANY CONCEPTION AND THE PROPOSAL WOULD MAKE SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER MORE WIDELY AVAILABLE. BY THROUGHOUT THE STATE LARGELY BY PROVIDING FUNDING FOR OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE ACTIVITIES FOR WATER TREATMENT SYSTEMS. AND SECOND THAT WERE FOUND THAT THERE'S UNCERTAINTY THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE PROPOSED REVENUES WILL FULLY ADDRESS THE PROBLEM. AND IN LARGE PART THIS IS BECAUSE THE EXTENT OF THE PROBLEM IS HIGHLY UNCERTAIN GIVEN THE LACK OF DATA ABOUT THE NUMBER SMALLER WATER SYSTEMS AND DOMESTIC WELLS AND. THAT FELT TO PROVIDE SAFE DRINKING WATER BUT WE KNOW THAT THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD IS PART OF THE PROPOSAL WOULD HAVE TO PREPARE AN ANNUAL NEEDS ASSESSMENT WHICH WOULD. PROVIDE THE LEGISLATURE WITH GREATER CERTAINTY ABOUT THE SCENE IN THE FUTURE. THERE'S ALSO UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE MATTER OF REVENUE THAT WILL BE GENERATED UNDER THE PROPOSAL I PARTICULARLY FROM AGRICULTURAL ENTITIES THAT BUDGET TRAILER LEGISLATION ALLOWS. THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD TO JUST ADD THAT. THE RATE PAYER CHARGES DOWNWARD AT THE FUNDING I PROVIDED EXCEEDS FEATURES DEMANDS. FOR FOR THE FUNDS ARE THERE IF THE DEMAND EXCEEDS DEFINING THE FUTURE ANY INCREASE IN CHARGE TO HAVE TO BE APPROVED BY THE LEGISLATURE. TO DOES PROVIDE SOME FLEXIBILITY ON THE LEVEL OF FUNDING MAINLY TO MOVE IT DOWN OR UP AT REQUIRE VOTER THE LEGISLATURE TO MOVE IT UP IF DEMAND. EXCEEDED THE MATTER REVENUES THAT ARE PROVIDED UNDER THE PROPOSAL AND FUTURE. AND FINALLY. THIS PROPOSAL MIGHT NOT FULLY IMPLEMENT THE POLLUTER PAYS PRINCIPLE IN THE POLLUTED PAYS PRINCIPLE IS A CONCEPT THAT THOSE ENTITIES THAT CAUSE ENVIRONMENTAL HARM. SHOULD BE RESPONSIVE FOR THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH CLEANING AND AT THAT CONTAMINATION TRACTION ADDRESSING THE HARM DONE. AND NEEDS PHYSICALLY HERE I'M TALKING ABOUT NITRATE CONTAMINATION IN THE GROUND. AND I IT'S NOT ENTIRELY CLEAR THAT THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING THAT WOULD BE PROVIDED UNDER THE PROPOSAL BY AGRICULTURAL ENTITIES WOULD BE SUFFICIENT TO ADDRESS THE NIGHT TING NITRATE CONTAMINATION. THAT IS COMING FROM THOSE ENTITIES AND ALSO IT'S NOT CERTAIN THAT SOME OF THE NITRATE CONTAMINATION THIS LEGACY CONTAMINATION FROM GOING BACK DECADES AND SAID THE PEOPLE THAT I AM. CURRENT AGRICULTURAL PRODUCERS DIDN'T BECAUSE THAT BUT SOME OF THAT FINDS THAT THERE I WOULD PROVIDE. THROUGH THESE OUTSIDE THE MAC IN OUR CHARGE MECHANISMS WOULD BE USED TO CLEAN UP THAT LEGACY CONTAMINATION SO THOSE ARE THE TWO REASONS WE FELT THAT IT MIGHT NOT FULLY IMPLEMENT THE POLLUTER PAYS PRINCIPLE. OTHERS CLOSE BY NOTING THAT THERE IS A BILL US SENATE BILL SIX TWENTY THREE THAT DOES LARGELY THE SAME. THAT THAT SAME THING DISCS UP PROPOSAL DIES AND IT'S WAS A LAST HEARD IN ASSEMBLY APPROPRIATIONS. THANK YOU DEPARTMENT FINANCE. NO COMMENTS OF ANY QUESTIONS MISTER BOND. I HAVE A QUICK BROAD QUESTION. FIDELIO IS IS IN TERMS OF OTHER ALTERNATIVES IN TERMS OF HOW TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM SHORT OF SIX ONE THREE IS THERE. MAIN DECIDED BALLING THEIR ANY OTHER COULD HAVE IDEAS. YEAH AND NOT THAT THEY WERE AWARE OF IT AT THIS TIME A EXCITEMENT IT SPECIFICALLY IN TERMS OF HOW TO FUND IT. DIDN'T NOT THAT THAT WE'VE SEEN IDENTIFIED ANOTHER LEGISLATION. GREAT SO WELL LETS SO. A ASK A ANY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WOULD LIKE TO BE HEARD ON THIS ISSUE TO BEGIN TO LINE UP AND FOUND STEP FORWARD. AS YOU CAN SEE THERE ARE. A GOOD MANY OF YOU I'M GOING TO AS WE DID WITHOUT PRIOR ITEM ASK YOU ALL. TO KEEP YOUR COMMENTS AS CONCISE AS POSSIBLE UP PLEASE RECOGNIZE THAT I THINK. WE'VE HEARD THE ARGUMENTS FOR AND AGAINST. SO I DON'T THINK YOU NEED TO ACTUALLY MAKE THOSE ARGUMENTS SAID TRY TO KEEP YOUR COMMENTS. AT FOCUSED ON WHETHER YOU SUPPORTER OPPOSE AND TO A ADDITIONAL COMMENTS AS NECESSARY AND IF YOU CAN HOLD YOUR COMMENTS TO THIRTY SECONDS MANY DID. IN THE PREVIOUS ITEM A FEW DIDN'T. WE GREATLY APPRECIATE IT GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN LIMON THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER FONG. I'M I'M WENDY RIVERBOATS WITH THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WATER AGENCIES ARE AQUA. A WE REPRESENT OVER FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY PUBLIC WATER AGENCIES AND OUT WATER PROVIDERS THAT RELIABLY DELIVER NINETY PERCENT. OF THE STATE'S DEVELOPED WATER ON RESPECTFULLY WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING THIS ISSUE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF A WATER TAX WITHIN A POLICY BILL OR OF A BUDGET TRAILER BILL FOR THE PAST YEAR. OUR ASSOCIATION HAS GONE ON RECORD IN OPPOSITION SEVERAL VENUES BUT ON TODAY WE JUST LIKE TO BRIEFLY FOCUS OUR COMMENTS ON WHAT WE CAN SUPPORT. AND TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER FONG IS IT A QUESTION JUST NOW WE SUPPORT A CREDIBLE AN EQUITABLE FUNDING MIX AND ALTERNATE. THAT A INCLUDES ONGOING FEDERAL SAFE DRINKING WATER STATE REVOLVING FUND DOLLARS RELIABLE GENERAL OBLIGATION WATER BOND MONEY FOCUSED NITRATE ASSESSMENTS AND THE STATE'S GENERAL FUND TO CREATE A FUNDING SOURCE. AS AS FOR INSTANCE UP PROTECTED INS AND SECURITY ENDOWMENT FUND OR SOME TYPE. OF OF FUN LIKE THAT THAT'S PROTECTED TO PAY THE OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE COSTS THAT WE DO AGREE WITH CHAIRMAN MARKETS ON THE OBJECTIVE WE DON'T AGREE WITH THE MEANS AT THIS POINT. WE FEEL THAT WE NEED THIS BALLOTS FUNDING PORTFOLIO PACKAGE TO ENSURE THAT THEY'RE SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER IN THESE COMMUNITIES THAT DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO IT. OUR PROPOSAL SEEKS AN ANNUAL SOME OF THIRTY FOUR POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND ITEM TO SOLVE A PROBLEM THAT REALLY WE AGREE TEARS AT THE SOCIAL FABRIC. WITHIN SOME OF THESE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES WITHIN CALIFORNIA THE GENERAL FUNDS LARGEST REVENUE SOURCE IS THE STATE'S PROGRESSIVE PERSONAL INCOME TAX. HAVING THIS PURPOSE WE THINK IS THE HIGHEST AND BEST USE OF THE GENERAL FUND AND AT THIS POINT IS A REALLY STILL A QUESTION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SHOULD BE USING. GENERAL FUND FOR THIS PURPOSE WE SUPPORT THE CRITICAL ISSUE BEING RESPECTED ON THAT THIS ISSUES RESPECTED WITHIN THE LEGISLATIVE POLICY. COMMITTEE PROCESS WERE MULTIPLE OPPORTUNITIES FOR INPUT ON IT AND AMENDMENTS AND TRANSPARENCY PREDICTABLY EXIST WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT THIS FACT FAST TRACKED ON BUDGET TRAILER BILL PROCESS. IS THE APPROPRIATE HOME FOR A STATE WHITEWATER TALKS TO BE VETTED THE WATER TAX HAS YET TO BE HEARD IN A REGULAR POLICY BILL HEARING I WOULD LIKE TO REMIND. THE SUBCOMMITTEE ON WE SUPPORT THE REALITY THAT THIS WATER TAXES IN FACT ATTACKS WHICH REQUIRES A TWO THIRDS SUPERMAJORITY VOTE REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE CONCEPT OCCURS AND A BUDGET. SUBCOMMITTEE THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS OR AND REGULAR LEGISLATION SO WHAT STANDING IN THE WAY OF AN UNPRECEDENTED COALITION. A SUPPORT FOR A REAL ALTERNATIVE FUNDING PACKAGE AND I THINK THE STATEWIDE WATER TAX PROPOSAL BEING HURT RIGHT NOW IN THIS BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE. IS THAT IS THAT IS WHAT STANDING IN THE WAY REALLY ULTIMATELY OF A SUCCESSFUL RESOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM WHY CAN'T WE WORK TOGETHER. WHY CAN'T WE TRY SOMETHING DIFFERENT AND SUPPORTER ALTERNATIVE FUNDING PACKAGE TO OBTAIN WHAT IS REMAIN ELUSIVE TO THIS POINT? UP ADMITS THE INSISTENT GOT HAVE WATER TAX GOTTA WATER TALKS ANSWER TO EVERY THOUGHTFUL FUNDING PACKAGE QUESTION THAT WE'VE POSTS WE APPRECIATE CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU ARE ONE THING I FORGOT TO MENTION THAT I IS THAT TO A WE ARE HOLDING THIS ITEM OPEN. UP FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH THAT. LANGUAGE BECAUSE YOU'RE HERE.

CLEAN WATER ESPECIALLY IN CENTRAL VALLEY IS A SERIOUS AND VITAL CONCERN THAT NEEDS ADDRESSING I THINK EVERYBODY IN THIS ROOM AGREES WITH THAT AND WE CERTAINLY SYMPATHIZE WITH IT. BUT LET'S BE CLEAR. ATTACKS ON A PUBLIC RESOURCE THAT IS IMPERATIVE TO LIFE IS ABSOLUTELY WITHOUT PRECEDENT ANYWHERE IN THE STATE. AND ANYWHERE IN THIS COUNTRY. IF THERE ISN'T SUFFICIENT MONEY IN THE GENERAL FUND TO ENSURE THAT ROUGHLY ONE MILLION CALIFORNIANS. I HAVE ACCESS TO CLEAN SAFE DRINKING WATER AND POLITICIANS ARE TRULY LOST THE ABILITY TO PRIORITIZE WHAT IS MOST IMPORTANT IN OUR BUDGET. MEMBERS QUITE FRANKLY IT'S EMBARRASSING THAT CAP AND TRADE MONEY IS GOING TO FUND ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES. FOR WE CONFRONT A PROBLEM THAT IS ORDERLY LIFE AND DEATH. AND MEMBERS THAT'S ESPECIALLY TRUE BECAUSE THERE'S SO MANY WAYS TO DEAL WITH THIS PROBLEM AND WHAT IS THIS ITEM IN THE BUDGET ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS I BELIEVE MAYBE EVEN A LITTLE BIT LAST. THERE'S SO MANY WAYS WE CAN FUND THIS THERE'S EXISTING STATE AND FEDERAL PROGRAMS THERE'S PROPOSITION ONE BOND DOLLARS. AND OF COURSE AS I MENTIONED EARLIER THIS ABOUT A BILLION OF EXISTING CAP AND TRADE DOLLARS THE CAN BE USED. DEAL WITH THIS PROBLEM.

THIS STATEWIDE TAX WOULD REPRESENT A DIVERSION OF LOCAL RAPE PARA DOLLARS TUNE OUT OF CONTROL STATE BUREAUCRACY THAT HAS WILL LITTLE ACCOUNTABILITY.
