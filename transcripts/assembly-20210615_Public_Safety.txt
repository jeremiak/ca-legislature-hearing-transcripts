MISTER CHAIR AND GOOD MORNING. TO YOU AND MEMBERS AND STAFF ALWAYS GOOD TO. SEE YOU ALL HERE. I AM HERE TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT THREE THE CALIFORNIA ABOLITION ACT. THIS AMENDMENT IS LONG OVERDUE AND I THINK IT IS INCREDIBLY FITTING TO BRING IT UP AS WE APPROACH JUNETEENTH MARKING THE EMANCIPATION OF BLACK PEOPLE OUT OF SLAVERY IN THE SOUTHERN PORTION OF THIS COUNTRY. THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION PROHIBITS SLAVERY AND INVOLUNTARY SERVITUDE EXCEPT TO PUNISH CRIME. ACA THREE SEEKS TO AMEND THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION TO REMOVE SUCH CONDITIONAL LANGUAGE ABOLISHING SLAVERY AND INVOLUNTARY SERVITUDE WITHOUT EXCEPTION. OVER NINETY FOUR THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS ARE CURRENTLY INCARCERATED IN STATE PRISON. AFRICAN AMERICANS ACCOUNT 428% OF THE PRISON POPULATION AND LESS THAN 6% OF CALIFORNIA'S OVERALL POPULATION. ALTHOUGH NO COURTS EXPLICITLY INCLUDE LABOR AS A CONDITION OF CRIMINAL SENTENCING THERE IS AN EXPECTATION THAT MANY INCARCERATED PEOPLE WILL PERFORM LABOR OFTENTIMES FOR AS LITTLE AS EIGHT CENTS AN HOUR. TODAY TWELVE STATES PROHIBIT AND SLAVE MEN AND INVOLUNTARY SERVITUDE BUT EXCEPTION PROVISIONS FOR CRIMINAL PUNISHMENT REMAINS CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF THOSE STATES. YOU KNOW SLAVERY WAS A POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC ENGINE FOR THE SOUTH IN THIS COUNTRY. AND ONE SLAVERY WAS ABOLISHED CONVICT LEASING ANTI LOITERING AND INVOLUNTARY SERVITUDE LAWS POPPED UP. ALL DESIGNED TO CONTINUE TO KEEP BLACK MEN AND WOMEN SHACKLED TO SYSTEMS OF FREE LABOR. INVOLUNTARY SERVITUDE FOR THE PUNISHMENT OF A CRIME A VESTIGE OF THOSE TIMES REMAINS AN ECONOMIC ENGINE FOR THIS COUNTRY AND FOR CALIFORNIA. THE MINIMUM ESTIMATED ANNUAL VALUE FOR INCARCERATED LABOR IN OUR PRISONS AND JAILS ANNUALLY IS TWO BILLION DOLLARS. IN CALIFORNIA FOR EXAMPLE WE SAVE UP TO ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR BY USING PRISON LABOR FOR CALIFORNIA IN THAT IS JUST ONE LABOR PROGRAM. DISSOLVING THE REMNANTS OF SLAVERY AND RACIAL INEQUALITY IS MORE IMPORTANT NOW THAN EVER. ALTHOUGH IT SHOULD ALWAYS BE IMPORTANT IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN COLORADO PASSED A BALLOT MEASURE THAT REMOVE SLAVERY AND INVOLUNTARY SERVITUDE AS A CRIMINAL PUNISHMENT FROM ITS STATE CONSTITUTION LAST YEAR VOTERS IN NEBRASKA AND UTAH VOTED TO REMOVE PRISON SLAVERY FROM THEIR STATE CONSTITUTIONS. ALSO IN TWENTY TWENTY U. S. SENATOR MERKLEY FROM OREGON INTRODUCED A RESOLUTION TO REMOVE INVOLUNTARY SERVITUDE AS A PUNISHMENT OF A CRIME FROM THE US CONSTITUTION. ACA THREE WILL NOT DO AWAY WITH COMMUNITY SERVICE ALTERNATIVE SENTENCING PROGRAMS THESE PROGRAMS STILL FUNCTION IN STATES LIKE COLORADO WHERE SIMILAR CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS HAVE TAKEN EFFECT. WE ARE NOT ASKING THAT LABOR PROGRAMMING WITHIN FACILITIES BE ABOLISHED SIMPLY OF THESE PROGRAMS ARE TO PERFORM AS ORIGINALLY DESIGNED AND THEY SHOULD BE PROVIDING OUR INCARCERATED BROTHERS AND SISTERS WITH AN APPROPRIATE WAGE. OUR CONSTITUTION SERVES AS THE GUIDING PRINCIPLE FOR ALL OTHER STATE LAWS THERE IS NO PLACE FOR SLAVERY FORCED LABOUR OR INVOLUNTARY SERVITUDE ON OUR BOOKS IF YOU TAUGHT IN NEBRASKA CAN DO WHAT. WE CAN TO. WITH ME IN SUPPORT HERE IN PERSON ARE YOU MILLION LAND FROM THE ANTI VIOLENCE SAFETY AND ACCOUNTABILITY PROJECT. AND RASHID LOCKHART OF THE AYE HYMNS A COLLECTIVE. AND I WILL RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. THANK YOU- THE MILAN- YOU MAY SPEAK FIRST AND THEN RASHID LOCKHART. SO THE WORD WE'RE KINDA RUSTY WE HADN'T AN IN PERSON IF THE PERSON IN A BODY YEAR YEAR AND A HALF NOW SO IT IS IT'S GREAT TO ACTUALLY THINK. RIGHT RIGHT HELLO ARE SO YOU YOU FIVE MINUTES IN TOTAL JUST TO ABUSE YOU CAN SPLIT IT UP TO AN A HALF MINUTES EACH OR YOU TO DO FOR BUT YOU MAIL LEAVE. MISS LOCKARD WITH THE- LOCKER WITH ONLY ONE. MISS OUT LONGER ONLY ONCE. I PROMISED TO MAKE YOUR- QUICK CENTER OKAY SO. GOOD MORE- I'VE LIKE TO YOU ALL. FOR TAKING THE TIME HEAR US THIS MORNING MY NAME IS MILLIONAIRE. I AM THE CHAIR OF THE CAL. ABOLITION ACT I AM ALSO MEMBER OF THE- COMMITTEE OF A- AND IN WHICH IS ABOUT. SLAVERY NATIONAL. WE ARE NOW. COALITION THAT COME IS KIND OF OVER. STATE THAT ARE ALL SEEKING REMOVE THIS LANGUAGE FROM THE RESPECTIVE STATES INVOLVES. CONSTITUTIONS I AM ALSO WORKING DIRECTLY WITH UNITED STATES SENATOR JEFF MERKLEY. IN INTRODUCING THE FEDERAL RESOLUTION TO ALSO AMEND THE THIRTEENTH AMENDMENT OF THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION. MY ARGUMENT TO SIR. IS THAT IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THERE'S NO MORAL ARGUMENT. TO BE LEVERED. THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO ENSLAVE A HUMAN BEING IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. STATE OF CALIFORNIA WAS ONE VOTE AWAY FROM BEING MADE A SLAVE STATE. I WILL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE. THIS IS MY HUSBAND SAMUEL BRO HE IS THE AUTHOR OF THE PROPOSAL THAT BECAME A CA THREE. HE IS CURRENTLY HOUSED INSIDE A LANCASTER STATE PRISON. IN SOUTH SOUTH US GETTING AND LOS ANGELES WHERE HE IS AN H. F. CUSTODIAN WORKER LAST YEAR WHEN COLBERT NOW. A ROUGH IT INTO OF HIS WHISTLE HE WAS TASK WITH GOING INSIDE OF SALES IN OFFICES AND CLEANING THEM WITHOUT PROPER PP YEAR. WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT. BECAUSE ONE SAMUEL SAID THAT HE WAS AFRAID FOR HIS LIFE. BECAUSE NO ONE KNEW WHAT WE WERE DEALING WITH THAT HE DID NOT WANT TO GO INTO THOSE SALES HE WAS TOLD THAT IF HE DID NOT HE WOULD BE HIT WITH A RULES VIOLATION A ONE FIFTEEN. WHICH AND TODAY IS THE MODERN DAY WHIP THE LATCH ON THE BACK. BECAUSE IF HE DID NOT GO TO WORK. HE HAD NO CHOICE. WHAT THAT DOES IS WHEN HE GOES UP FOR PAROLE. THEY SEE THAT ONE FIFTEEN IN HIS FILE. THEY AUTOMATICALLY DENY HIM. BILLS THEN I'LL START OFF. FIFTEEN THEN THEY WALK THEM DOWN TEN SEVEN FIVE. AND THREE YEARS. PARDON THAT'S ACTUALLY SEMELHANTE. SOUL WHAT IS HER IN THE STATE OF. I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT THIS IS ABOUT WAGES. THIS IS NOT ABOUT WAGES THIS IS ABOUT FAIR TREATMENT OF HUMAN BEINGS AND THE FACT THAT WE HAVE ANY REMNANTS. OF SLAVERY IN CALIFORNIA'S CONSTITUTION IN THE YEAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE IS AN COMPREHENSIBLE. AND SO I AM ASKING TODAY FOR THE SUPPORT OF A CA THREE. FOUR A YES VOTE. THANK YOU. MISTER LOCKHART. YOU'RE NOW OUR SECOND INAUGURAL IN PERSON TESTIMONY THANK YOU CAN HEAR ME YES OKAY IT'S ON A PRIVILEGE TO BE HERE I WANT TO THANK YOU SO MY NAME IS BY SHEETS LOCKHART. YEAH THIS IS ALL IN THE ROOM THAT DON'T TOUCH OUR. I SO MY RUSHES TO LOCKER I AM A FORM THAT COURSE PER WHO'S THE AGE OF FIFTEEN HAS BEEN EVER YEAR OF HIS AND CAR.

CONFINEMENT AND MY PER AS INCARCERATED BY. DOING THE JOB OF SAY LIVES AND PER. MY TO EDUCATE. WAS DENIED I WAS THAT HE WAS EITHER THE- OR EDUCATION. AND SO I WASN'T ABLE TO FURTHER PURSUE MY COLLEGE CAREER THAT I WAS TRYING TO. ACHIEVE THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION PROHIBITS SLAVERY AND INVOLUNTARY SERVITUDE EXCEPT TO PUNISH CRIME. YOUR SUPPORT THIS BILL WOULD AMEND THE CONSTITUTION ABOLISHED SLAVERY INVOLUNTARY SERVITUDE AND ALL CONTACT FROM INDIGENOUS PEOPLE IN SPANISH MISSIONS THE BLACK SLAVES FORCED TO MINE FOR GOLD CALIFORNIA'S HISTORY OF SLAVERY ONCE DE. TODAY THE PRACTICE CONTINUES IN THE FORM OF FORCED LABOR ISN'T PRESENT WHICH FALLS DISPROPORTIONATELY ON BLACK LATINO AND ASIAN POPULATIONS. AND INDIGENOUS PEOPLE. THIS LAW IS A DIRECT REFLECTION OF THE LEGACY AND REMNANTS OF SLAVERY BETTER WOMAN IN EMBEDDED IN THE PRISON SYSTEM. THERE IS NO WAY TO DIVORCE IS LANGUAGE FROM SLAVERY IT'S HISTORIES AN EXTRA COUPLE FROM THE FOUNDATIONAL POLICIES AND PRACTICES OF SLAVERY. SLAVERY IS WRONG NO MATTER WHAT. CALIFORNIA'S CONSTITUTION SILVA OUR VALUES SLAVERY IS NOT A CALIFORNIA BY. LET'S DO THIS NOW AND SET AN EXAMPLE YOU TAUNT ADDRESSES LEGISLATORS LEGISLATURES PASSED SIMILAR MEASURES WITH A 100% SUPPORT. LET ME ASSURE FLAVORS NEVER PART OF CALIFORNIA STORY AGAIN IF GIVEN THE CHANCE I'M CONFIDENT THAT CALIFORNIA'S PEOPLE WOULD DECIDE AGAINST SLAVERY. LET THEM HAVE THEIR VOICE IN THIS MATTER.

SO MISTER CLARK IF YOU HAVE A QUESTION OR COMMENT YOU MAY NOW YEAH SORRY THE COMMENT AND YOU CAN RESPOND IN YOUR CLOSE UP MY KIDS SO FIRST OF ALL LET ME MOVE THE BELL. I'M SURE YOU'LL GET A VERY GOOD VOTE OUT OF. GET OUT OF COMMITTEE GO ON THE BALLOT AND- I WOULD HOPE THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA THEN APPROVE IT. BUT MY PROBLEM IS THAT IT MAY NOT. JUST CHANGING THIS DEPENDS UPON THE COURT'S INTERPRETATION. OF WHAT IT MEANS THAT WE DON'T HAVE INVOLUNTARY SERVITUDE AND PRISONS. IT COULD BE THAT NOTHING CHANGES OR COULD BE EVERYTHING CHANGES IT ALL DEPENDS UPON THE COURTS. WHAT WE REALLY NEED TO DO AND THIS IS TRUE WHETHER THIS AMENDMENT PASSES OR NOT IS AS A LEGISLATURE AND I WOULD HOPE YOU WOULD LEAD THIS EFFORT. TO COME UP WITH NEW RULES FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF. THE BILL ATTENTION CORRECTIONS- SHOULD WE BE PAYING MINIMUM WAGE OR SOME FRACTION THEREOF. THAT WOULD PROBABLY COST ABOUT TWO BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR WHICH THEN WOULD COME OUT OF OTHER PROGRAMS. BUT MAYBE THAT'S AN INVESTMENT WE WANT TO MAKE. PARTICULARLY IF WE COULD KEEP THAT MONEY IN TRUST UNTIL A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF AND TRUST INTO PEOPLE GOT OUT. WE COULD HAVE A MUCH LOWER RECIDIVISM RATE SO I CAN SEE THE REAL ADVANTAGES OF THAT. BUT REGARDLESS OF WHAT IT IS WE DECIDE WE SHOULD DECIDE AND THAT'S TRUE WHETHER THIS PASSES OR NOT. SO WHEN YOU'RE CLOSE- I'M HOPING THAT YOU WILL PLEDGE TO BRING FORWARD A BILL. TO DISCUSS WHAT THE PARAMETERS SHOULD BE SO THAT WE KNOW THAT WE WILL GET REAL CHANGE THANK YOU. WE WANT TO DO IT IN YOUR CLOTHES. YES HELLO MISS WICKS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I JUST WHEN I THINK OF THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING ABOUT THIS BILL AND YOUR LEADERSHIP NOT NOT ONLY ON THIS ISSUE BUT ACROSS THE BOARD INCOME ADDRESSES REFORM ISSUES. AND WOULD LOVE TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE. C. IN UPPER MISSION MR LEE I THANK THE SENATOR FOR BRING THIS IMPORTANCE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT IT'S IT WAS REAL STAND ON CALIFORNIA'S LEGACY THAT STILL EXISTS HERE I THINK OBVIOUSLY IT IS ALL ONLY JUST COMMENT BUT OF THE QUALIFIED EXEMPTION OF SLAVERY THAT STILL PERSISTS AFTER THE CIVIL WAR IN THE CASE EXCEPT FOR PUNISHMENT IS OBVIOUSLY A GLARING ERROR IN THAT AND OBVIOUSLY ONE HAS FUELED THE MASS INCARCERATION EXIST IN THIS COUNTRY AND I'M REALLY GLAD THAT WE'RE TAKING THE AFFIRMATIVE STEP TOWARDS ERASING. THE EVOLUTION OF SLAVERY EXISTENCE COUNTRY WE KNOW THIS EXISTS FOR WAGES- EXPLOITATION THROUGH MAKING A PRISON INMATES CONDUCT ACTUAL VITAL SERVICES IN PRODUCTION THAT'S LIKE THIS ACROSS THIS COUNTRY SO HOPEFULLY AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM ARCHIVE OF THE SPACE ALLUDED TO HOPEFULLY WILL BE TAKING THE ON THAT WOULD LOVE TO JOIN YOU IN THAT EFFORT TO MAKE SURE THAT REAL HUMAN TAKING A REAL HUMAN LABOR IS ACTUALLY VALUE THIS EVEN THE CONTACTS OF PRISONS THEY'RE STILL HUMAN BEINGS AND THEY SHOULD BE TREATED AS SUCH- WE DIDN'T SENTENCE THEM SET YOU FREE LABOR. AND ANY SIX ANY OTHER CONTACTS THAT IS SLAVERY OF COURSE- SO REALLY HOPEFULLY THAT WE WILL BE WORK ON THE. CENTER AND I'M HAPPY SUPPORT TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER COM. YOU MAY CLOSE MISS CALLER THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I FIRST WANNA THANK YOU FOR AGENDA ISING THIS ITEM- SO THAT WE COULD HAVE THIS DISCUSSION AND I THINK MY COLLEAGUES FOR YOUR COMMENTS. I WANT TO- ADDRESS THE QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS RAISED BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER QUIRK IN FACT THERE. IS CASE LAW ON THE BOOKS DATING BACK TO EIGHTEEN EIGHTY THREE. ON THE- CONSTITUTIONALITY OF SLAVERY IN FACT IN NINETEEN ELEVEN- BAILEY V. ALABAMA THEY ACTUALLY QUESTIONED IT WITH REGARDS TO INVOLUNTARY SERVITUDE. THIS IS ABOUT TAKING THIS ISSUE OUT OF THIS BODY INTO THE VOTERS IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO BY PUTTING IT ON A BALLOT- IT COULD BE CHALLENGED IN THE COURTS IT COULD GO TO THE STATE SUPREME COURT IT COULD GO TO THE NINTH CIRCUIT- I BELIEVE THEY'RE STANDING BECAUSE THERE ARE OTHER STATES WHO HAVE ALSO PASSED THIS- AND HAVE AND ARE BEGINNING THE CONVERSATIONS. AROUND DIGNIFIED AND APPROPRIATE WAGES AND PAY. ULTIMATELY- THERE ARE TWO ISSUES WHAT. OUR STATE CONSTITUTION SAYS AND THEN WHAT ARE PENAL CODE SECTION SAYS AND OTHER LAWS ON THE BOOKS THAT WE HAVE AS WELL AS OTHER JURISDICTIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AROUND WHAT IS AN APPROPRIATE WAGE AND I HOPE- THAT AID THIS PASSES AND THAT BE WE CAN CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT IS AN APPROPRIATE WAGE FOR SOMEONE WHO IS INCARCERATED- AND THAT. PEOPLE WILL GET UNCOMFORTABLE. BECAUSE IT WILL ULTIMATELY FORCE FOLKS TO DECIDE. THE VALUE OF THE BODY WHILE THEY ARE INCARCERATED THE VALUE OF A PERSON WHILE THEY ARE INCARCERATED. AND I DON'T KNOW WHERE THAT WILL LEAD US BUT IT SURELY SHOULD LEAD US TO SOMEPLACE OTHER THAN EIGHT CENTS AN HOUR. YOU KNOW THE PENAL CODE SAYS THAT CDCR SHALL REQUIRE OF EVERY ABLE BODIED PRISONER IMPRISONED IN ANY STATE PRISON AS MANY HOURS. OF FAITHFUL LABOR IN EACH DAY AND EVERY DAY. DURING HIS OR HER TERM OF IMPRISONMENT AS SHALL BE PRESCRIBED BY THE RULES AND REGULATIONS OF THE DIRECTOR F CORRECTIONS. WHEN I READ THAT. I THOUGHT TO MYSELF. THIS IS VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT I WOULD HEAR. IN A STORY ABOUT A SLAVE OWNER AND A PLANTATION. AND HOW DO WE RE ENGINEER. WHAT CRIMINAL JUSTICE LOOKS LIKE WHAT OUR CRIMINAL LEGAL SYSTEM SHOULD LOOK LIKE AND HOW WE TREAT PEOPLE. THESE ARE REAL VESTIGES OF SLAVERY THAT WE ARE DEALING WITH THAT YOU ALL DEAL WITH EVERY SINGLE TIME THE BILL COMES BEFORE YOU IN MANY INSTANCES MISTER LOCKHART WHILE HE DIDN'T SAY. HAD TO ACTUALLY GET PERMISSION. FROM HIS PAROLE OFFICER. TO COME HERE TODAY TO TESTIFY. IF THAT ISN'T HAVING A SILENT INVISIBLE SHACKLE ON YOU. I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS. SOI AM HOPING THAT YOU WILL VOTE ON THIS BILL THAT IT WILL ALLOW WE WILL BE ALLOWED TO BRING IT TO THE FLOORS AND ULTIMATELY THAT WE WILL BE ALLOWED TO BRING THIS TO THE VOTERS IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO YOU KNOW WORDS MATTER WORDS. MATTER BECAUSE THEY PRESCRIBE OUR VALUES AND I HAVE TO BELIEVE THAT IN. THIS YEAR. OF THIS CENTURY WE ARE WORKING. TO RE THINK. SOME OF THE REMNANTS OF TIMES THAT WERE NOT GOOD TO CERTAIN PEOPLE. AND TO FIX THOSE SO IN THE WORDS OF ONE OF THE CALLERS. MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE LET'S DO THIS LET'S PASS ACA THREE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS. IN OUR AND I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR. FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD ESPECIALLY SO CLOSE TO COUNTY. AND WHEN YOU REALLY THINK OF JUNETEENTH LIKE A LOT OF CELEBRATIONS FOR A LOT OF DAYS THAT WE HONOR WHAT IS HAPPENED IN THE PAST. IF YOU REALLY THINK ABOUT JUNETEENTH IT'S ABOUT DELAYING JUSTICE I'M IN TEXAS BOB SLAYTON TAXES WEREN'T NOTIFIED. WHEN SLAVERY ENDED AND IT WAS DELIBERATE. IT WAS DELIBERATE BECAUSE IT WAS ECONOMICALLY NOT IN TEXAS'S ADVANTAGE TO LET PEOPLE FREE LABOR. OUT OF TEXAS SLAVERY WAS BEGUN BECAUSE OF FREE LABOR. INDENTURED SERVITUDE BACK IN ENGLAND WAS ALL ABOUT COMPANIES BEING ABLE TO GET THE CHEAPEST LABOR EVEN CHILD LABOR. TO BE ABLE TO KEEP THE ECONOMY GOING. REASON WE WERE THREE FIFTHS A PERSON BECAUSE YOU CAN'T FORCE BEEN INDIVIDUAL TO WORK FOR LESS. UNLESS YOU DOWNGRADE THEM IN THAT MANNER AND THAT'S WHY WE WERE ABLE TO GET AWAY WITH SLAVERY WHICH BUILT THIS COUNTRY. BUILT THIS ON THE BACKS OF SLAVES THEY GO ALL THE WAY BACK FORTY YEARS AGO. AND SO IT'S AN ECONOMIC AND. FOR INDIVIDUALS ACROSS READ. JUST THINK OF IT- IF WE HAD PAID THIS MAN WHAT HE WAS WORTH. I NOTICED A SKETCH ABOUT HOW UCH MONEY THAT IS BUT WE HAVE PAID THIS MAN WHO IS WORTH A THOUSAND DOLLARS A WEEK THAT YOU WOULD PAY A FIREFIGHTER. HE WILL WALK OUT OF PRISON ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS TO START HIS LIFE ALL OVER AGAIN. YEAH HE ACTUALLY EARNED BY PUTTING HIS LIFE ON THE LINE. THAT'S REPARATIONS I'M ON REPARATIONS ISSUE BE PART OF IT WE SHOULD LOOK AT ALL THE LAWS THAT HAVE KEPT AFRICAN AMERICANS LATINOS AND OTHERS BEHIND.

THE STUFF UP ANY- AND FOR- THANK YOU- MISTER CHAIRMAN FOR THE RECORD I DID VOTE FOR THIS BILL IN THE SENATE. I GUESS. THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT- SO- OUR COLLEAGUES- THANK YOU FOR HEARING THIS BILL TODAY. SENATE BILL SEVENTY THREE- WHICH YOU HAVE SEEN- BEFORE- I CARRY THIS BILL LAST YEAR THAT A MOVE BECAUSE ECHO OF IT. ASSEMBLY MEMBER ARCADIO HAS CARRIED IN THE PAST CENTER SKINNER HAS CARRIED AND WE'RE HOPING TO FINALLY. GET IT DONE THIS YEAR- EXCUSE ME THREE WILL REPEAL MANDATORY MINIMUM JAIL SENTENCES FOR PEOPLE CONVICTED OF CERTAIN. NONVIOLENT DRUG OFFENSES- BY PROVIDING JUDGES WITH THE DISCRETION- TWO FIVE CENTS PERSON TO PROBATION- BASED ON THE FACTS OF THE CASE- IT'S I THINK SURPRISING TO A LOT OF PEOPLE THAN IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE CALIFORNIA- WE STILL HAVE A SITUATION. WHERE PEOPLE ARE CONVICTED OF NONVIOLENT DRUG OFFENSES- AND- A JUDGE IS MANDATED TO SEND THE PERSON. TO JAIL OR PRISON AND HAS NO DISCRETION WHATSOEVER- TO PUT THE PERSON ON PROBATION NO MATTER WHAT THE FACTS OF THE CASE ARE- IT FLIES IN THE FACE OF. OUR EFFORTS HERE IN CALIFORNIA TO AND THE WAR ON DRUGS- TO TAKE A DIFFERENT APPROACH. AND TO GIVE JUDGES THE FLEXIBILITY TO- SENDS PEOPLE BASED ON THE FACTS. OF THE CASE. AS ALL THIS BILL DOES JUDGES. A JUDGE CAN STILL SENDS A PERSON. TO JAIL IF THE JUDGE THINKS IT'S APPROPRIATE. THIS BILL DOES NOT CHANGE WITH THE MAXIMUM. SENTENCES THE JUDGE WILL RETAIN ALL THE TOOLS TO ISSUE AN APPROPRIATE SENTENCE. BUT THE JUDGE WILL HAVE. THE DISCRETION TO PLACE A PERSON ON PROBATION IF THE JUDGE. DETERMINES IS APPROPRIATE. BASED ON THE FACTS. OF THE CASE- THE COLLEAGUES AGAIN THANK YOU FOR IN THE CASE OF THE THIS BILL TODAY AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK. FOR AN AYE VOTE. I WITH ME TODAY- TESTIFIED BY PHONE. OR JUDGE HARLING GROSSMAN WHO IS A RETIRED SUPERIOR COURT JUDGE FROM COST. CONTRA COSTA COUNTY. AND NEXT TO OATEN WHO ISN'T. ATTORNEY WITH THE LAW ANGELES PUBLIC WITH OFFICE THANK YOU. AT&amp;T OPERATOR. COMING OUT HERE FROM THE WITNESSES. MISTER STEWART OPEN NEXT DOOR TO OPEN AND A JUSTICE. FOR ALL OKAY IT NEEDS TO KNOW NOW ITH HAPPY THAT HUMANA WELL I WOULD DEFER TO JUDGE CRESSMAN BUT I CAN- I CAN CERTAINLY GO FIRST MAKE CERTAIN SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDER DISSERTATION I AM THE POWER TURNING THE LOS ANGELES PUBLIC DEFENDER. AND SEVENTY THREE DRESSES INEQUITY IN THE LAW REQUIRING MINIMUM. FOR NONVIOLENT DRUG OFFENDERS UNDER CURRENT LAW A PERSON EACH WHITE COMMITTEE PULP QUITE KIELDER TWICE THE DEATH IS AN ILLEGAL WEAPON IS NOT SUBJECT TO A MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCE. IT MAKES SENSE BECAUSE IT ALLOWS JUDGES TO TREAT CASES INDIVIDUALLY HANDING DOWN DEATH SENTENCES THAT MAKE THE MOST SENSE THAT INDIVIDUAL THE PUBLIC BASED ON THE SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE CASE. THAT INDIVIDUAL HISTORY- AND PUBLIC SAFETY CONCERNS UNFORTUNATELY UNTIL NOW THAT YOU HAVE NOT BEEN GRANTED THE SAME DISCRETION FOR MANY NON VIOLENT DRUG OFFENSES MEANING THAT IRONICALLY COURTED AND REQUIRED TO ATTEND CALIFORNIA CONNECT OF NONVIOLENT DRUG OFFENSE THE JAIL OR PRISON. EVEN WHEN DOING SO IS NOT IN THE INTERESTS THE PUBLIC AN INDIVIDUAL. SB THIRTY THREE PRESS WITH THE CRAP IN THE BY REMOVING THE REQUIREMENT THAT JUDGES TEND CALIFORNIA TO JAIL OR PRISON FOR NONVIOLENT DRUG OFFENSES WELL STILL GIVING THEM THAT CREDIT DISCRETION TO DO SO IN AN APPROPRIATE CASE. BECAUSE THE BILL SIMPLY BRING DRUG SENTENCING INTO LINE WITH THE SENTENCING OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO COURTS AND OTHER NON DRUG CASES. WE ARE YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. JUDGE GROSSMAN. MORNING AND I APOLOGIZE I WAS WAITING FOR THE EIGHTEENTH CAN OPERATE WITHIN. TELL ME TO A NEW. I AM HARLEM GROSSMAN ON THE RETIRED JUDGE FROM CONTRA COSTA COUNTY I RETIRED NINE YEARS AGO AFTER TWENTY ONE YEARS OF JUDICIAL SERVICE. I WAS A PROSECUTOR FOR NINE YEARS BEFORE BECOMING A JUDGE. SINCE RETIRING I'VE BEEN ACTIVE IN CRIMINAL JUSTICE POLICY ADVOCATES THE- I'M GIVING TESTIMONY THIS MORNING TO ADVOCATE IN SUPPORT OF SENATE BILL SEVENTY THREE. WHICH WOULD REPEAL THE PROBATION INELIGIBILITY AND PARTICLES PENSION OF SENTENCES PROVISIONS FOR CERTAIN ENUMERATED NONVIOLENT DRUG OFFENSES. THEIR BY STAFF RESTORING JUDICIAL DISCRETION TO IMPOSE APPROPRIATE SENTENCES TAILORED TO THE INDIVIDUAL CIRCUMSTANCES OF EACH DEPENDENT THAT COME BEFORE THE COURT. RESTRICTIONS ON JUDICIAL DISCRETION IN SENTENCING DID NOT SERVE AS A DETERRENT TO CRIME. RATHER THEY ONLY SERVE TO LIMIT THE DISCRETION OF THE ANTI THE HANDS OF JUDGES INVOLVED IN THE EDUCATION THIS POSITION AND RESOLUTION OF THESE CASES. IT MAKES LITTLE SENSE TO LIMIT JUDICIAL DISCRETION AND THAT'S SOMETHING OF THESE MATTERS WHEN JUDGES RETAIN AND EXERCISE THEIR DISCRETION ON MUCH WEIGHTIER ISSUES. SUCH AS WHETHER TO IMPOSE THE DEATH PENALTY WHETHER TO STRIKE TO STRIKE CONVICTION. WHETHER A CASE SHOULD PROCEED IN JUVENILE COURT OR BE TRANSFERRED TO CRIMINAL COURT WHICH WOULD BE ADULT COURT. WHEN IT COMES TO SOMETHING CALIFORNIA SHOULD NOT HAVE A ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH. MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCES ARE NOT AFFECTED IN ANY WAY INCLUDING NOT BEING COST EFFECTIVE. ENACTING SENATE BILL SEVENTY THREE WILL PERMIT MORE EFFECTIVE DESCENDED BATES SENTENCING. AND MORE EFFICIENT USE OF CALIFORNIA'S CRIMINAL JUSTICE RESOURCES. I'M URGING A AYE VOTE IN SUPPORT OF SENATE BILL SEVENTY THREE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. AND NOW ANY WITNESSES IN THE ROOM IN FAVOR SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES IN A VIDEO CONFERENCE ROOM.

AT CHAIR MEMBERS JONATHON FELDMAN WITH THE CALIFORNIA POLICE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION OPPOSE PRIMARILY BECAUSE THE BILL INCLUDES CRIMES INVOLVING CHILDREN THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR. THERE ARE NO OTHER PARTICIPANTS CUED UP MISTER CHAIR- BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE OR ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. WE JUST DID- HOW MOVE THE BELL OKAY CAN YOU ADD ME AS A CO AUTHOR I WOULD LOVE TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER THANK YOU OKAY WELL I LIKE ALMOST EVERYONE IN YOUR PATH- SO THE OPPOSITION IS COMPLAINING THAT PEOPLE WON'T GET PUNISHED- FIRST OF ALL. THERE'S NO EVIDENCE THAT PUNISHMENT ACTUALLY CAUSES THERE TO BE LESS IN THE WAY OF DRUG- BILL TAKING DRUGS PEOPLE GETTING DRUG OVERDOSES IN FACT IT PROBABLY KILLS PEOPLE. BECAUSE WHEN THEY'RE GETTING DRUNK OF OVERDOSE IS THERE SOMEWHERE QUIET OR THEY'RE SHARING NEEDLES AND GET HIV AT CETERA- IN FACT PORTUGAL IS GONE TOO NO PUNISHMENT FOR DRUG POSSESSION. THEY STILL GO AFTER TRAFFICKERS BUT THERE'S NO PUNISHMENT FOR DRUG POSSESSION AND PEOPLE STILL. GO INTO REHABILITATION FOR IT SO I THINK THIS WHOLE EFFORT AT PUNISHING PEOPLE FOR DRUG POSSESSION IS WRONG BUT- EVEN SO I AM VOTING FOR A BILL WHICH WILL ALLOW THE JUDGE TO THROW THE BOOK AT SOMEONE IF THEY WANT TO- AND THE OPPOSITION LETTERS YOU'RE SAYING- THEY'LL BE NO PUNISHMENT. UNFORTUNATELY THERE WILL BE PUNISHMENT- SO THAT I THINK THAT THAT OPPOSITION ARGUMENT IS WRONG- BUT FRANKLY I WISH OF HER RIGHT. BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SAVING PEOPLE BY PREVENTING THEM FROM TAKING DRUGS WHEN IN FACT WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT WHEN THEY TAKE DRUGS RATHER THAN. BEING REALLY REHABILITATED THEY OFTEN END U IN JAIL WITH A MUCH WORSE LIFE THAN THEY WOULD HAVE HAD IF WE WEREN'T ENFORCING THESE LAWS. SO THAT- THAT'S WHY I'M SUPPORTING THIS BILL AND I WOULD SUPPORT JUST DECRIMINALIZING THAT BEGAN WITH THANK YOU. IS THERE ANY OTHER COMMENTS ARE CONCERNED. YOU MAY CLOSE. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN I DO AN EXAM WE'RE A LITTLE BIT SURPRISED BY- THE- LATE LAW ENFORCEMENT OPPOSITION- THEY'VE NOT OPPOSE THIS BILL IN THE PAST THE DA'S ASSOCIATION ACTUALLY WHEN THIS BILL WAS INTRODUCED A FEW MONTHS AGO SCORED IN THE PROCESS. SENATE THEY HAD NO ISSUE WITH THAT SO IT'S A LITTLE BIT SURPRISING- AND I DO JUST WANT TO MENTION IN TERMS OF- MINERS EXISTING LAW CREATES A PRESUMPTION AGAINST PROBATION- FOR CASES INVOLVING MINORS- IT FOR RELATING TO COCAINE METH AND HEROIN. BUT THEN THERE ARE OTHER DRUGS THAT IT BANS PROBATION SO WE'RE SIMPLY ALIGNING IT TO CURRENT LAW FOR METH COCAINE AND HEROIN- SO I JUST DON'T THINK ABOUT IS A PARTICULARLY COMPELLING ARGUMENT GIVEN THAT WERE REALLY JUST ALIGNING UNDER. ALREADY EXISTING LAW WITH RESPECT TO MYERS A CREATES A STRONG PRESUMPTION AGAINST OPERATIONS SO OCT COLORS I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. AND AGAIN I WANNA THANK YOU ARE THE IRONIC PART IS A WHEN MR QUIRK AND I FIRST GOT HERE IN TWENTY TWELVE WHEN IT WHEN AND WHEN NOT WE SAT ON THIS COMMITTEE BACK BACK IN THE DAY A WE DON'T TRUST JUDGES. CATIONS DIVERSION PROGRAMS. OBVIOUSLY WE'VE COME A LONG WAY TO WHERE WE ARE NOW WANTED TO TRUST JUDGES TO MAKE THOSE DECISIONS SAID IT'S JUST AND I GUESS IN A RELATIVELY SHORT PERIOD TIME EIGHT YEARS- THIS DOES BODY IS NOW WILLING TO ENTRUST- JUDGES DOING THEIR JOB. AND DOING IT AND NOT A COMPASSIONATE WAY BUT ALSO MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE WHO NEED TO GO TO JAIL. WILL GO TO JAIL AND SO- IT FOR ME IT'S A- IT SHOWS HOW THE SYSTEM CAN CAN CHANGE A MOVE FOR TO BECOME. A LITTLE MORE COMPASSION IN PROGRESSIVE BUT MOST IMPORTANT HOW JUDGES CAN EVEN CHANGE- BECAUSE WE USED TO FILL THEM WITH THAT OF FORMER PROSECUTORS AND- AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE. AND SO ON RIGHT. THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND JURORS RECOMMENDED AND I. CALDERON ON SB SEVENTY THREE BY SENATOR WIENER THE MOTION IS DUE PASSED TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER HI JONES SAWYER IRAQI NO. LACKEY NEL PARA CAN BARRICADE HAD I LEE.

CORTEZ HE FOR CASEY SORRY ABOUT THAT SENATOR CORTEZ YOU WHENEVER YOU'RE READY IT'S FIVE THE PRECIADO IN THE QUESTION AND THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR IN MEMBERS I'M I'M HERE TODAY TO PRESENT SB THREE EIGHTY THREE THE JUVENILE DIVERSION ACT OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE SB THREE TWO THREE SIX TO EXPAND. THE REHABILITATION OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOUTH WHO COMMIT NONVIOLENT FELONIES BY INCREASING ACCESS TO DIVERSION PROGRAMS. BY DOING THIS WE CAN ASSURE THAT A SPECIALIZED SOLUTION IS PROVIDED FOR YOUTH INSTEAD OF A ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH. IN TWO THOUSAND. THE PASSAGE OF PROP TWENTY ONE GREATLY LIMITED ELIGIBILITY FOR JUVENILE DIVERSION. HOWEVER MODERN THE RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENT BEHAVIOR BRAIN DEVELOPMENT CONFIRM. THAT YOUTHFULNESS MATTERS AND THAT YOU SHOULD BE TREATED DIFFERENTLY THAN ADULTS. SB THREE EIGHTY THREE FOLLOWS RESEARCH BY MAKING YOU CHARGED WITH FELONIES THAT ARE NOT SERIOUS AND VIOLENT ELIGIBLE FOR INFORMAL SUPERVISION. ADDITIONALLY SB THREE EIGHTY THREE INSURERS THAT YOUTH ALLEGED TO HAVE SOLD OR POSSESSED FOR SALE THE CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE ARE NOT EXCLUDED FROM RECEIVING INFORMAL SUPERVISION. SB THREE EIGHTY THREE ALSO REMOVES UNNECESSARY PROCEDURAL BARRIERS TO WILL ALLOW USE COUNTY OF RESIDENCE CAN TO CONDUCT AN ANALYSIS. OF THE USE NEEDS ENOUGH IF APPROPRIATE OFFER INFORMAL SUPERVISION THROUGH DIVERSION PROGRAM. FINALLY SB THREE EIGHTY THREE INSURERS THAT INDIGENT YOUTHS ARE NOT DENIED ELIGIBILITY FOR DIVERSION PROGRAMS DUE TO THEIR INABILITY TO MAKE RESTITUTION PAYMENT. MANY OF THESE ALL STEM FROM A TOUGH ON CRIME PERIOD WERE THESE YOUTH WERE OFTEN LABELED AS SUPER PREDATORS. AT THIS POINT IN TIME WE NOW KNOW THE HARSH SENTENCES IN INCREASED PUNISHMENTS ESPECIALLY FOR YOUTH DOES LITTLE TO MITIGATE CRIME. INSTEAD TOUGH ON CRIME LAWS WITH YOUTH CREATE A CARCERAL SOCIETY THAT DEHUMANIZES THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN CONVICTED OF CRIMES. WE MUST CONTINUE TO RIGHT THIS WRONG.

TECH CHANGES TO THE LAW ON JUVENILE DIVERSION FIRST THANK YOU FOR THE EXCELLENT ANALYSIS IT'S A REALLY CLEAR ARTICULATION OF THE PRINCIPLES OF THE INFORMAL SUPERVISION AND DEFERRED ENTRY OF JUDGMENT- AS NOTED BY CENTER COURT HAS THE BILL- CLEANS UP THE PROCESS WHICH OCCURS WHEN A USER IS ARRESTED IN ONE COUNTY BUT HE IS- A RESIDENT OF ANOTHER. ALLOWING THE HOME COUNTY TO MAKE A SUITABILITY DETERMINATION- OF DIVERSION SECONDLY IT REMOVES IMPEDIMENTS FOR FIRST TIME SIRIK NON SERIOUS NONVIOLENT FELONIES. FOR A DIVERSION TO BE ORDERED WE JUST THINK THAT THERE ARE OCCASIONS WHERE A JUDGE- PURSUANT TO THAT KIND OF DISCRETION THAT THE KERR MENTIONED IN THE LAST BILL. OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO MAKE A DIVERSION ORDER- SO WE THINK IT'S A RIGHT ATCH WE APPRECIATE CENTER CORTEZ THE WE APPRECIATE THE ANALYSIS AND WE WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU SIR.

THE LAW ENFORCEMENT TRAINING THE BILL THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS FIRST I WANT TO EXPRESS MY APPRECIATION FOR THE COMMITTEE'S EFFORTS ON THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS AND THE AND ALICE'S. THIS LEGISLATURE THIS COMMITTEE IS ALL TOO FAMILIAR WITH LEGISLATION IN RECENT YEARS TO TRY TO REFORM AND IMPROVE POLICING IN CALIFORNIA SB FOUR NINETY FOUR IS A SMALL BUT IMPORTANT STEP TO ADDRESS HOW LAW ENFORCEMENT IS TRAINED TO INTERACT WITH THE PUBLIC FROM A VERY FROM THE VERY BEGINNING. BE IN THE POLICE ACADEMY OR THE ROBERT PRESSLEY INSTITUTE OF CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION. OVER THE PAST SEVENTY FIVE YEARS POLICE HAVE RELIED ON CRIMINAL INTERROGATION STRATEGY KNOWN AS THE REID TECHNIQUE. WHICH RELIES HEAVILY ON ASSUMING GUILT ASSESSING BEHAVIORAL CLUES OF DECEPTION IN ADMINISTERING PSYCHOLOGICAL MANIPULATION. QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN RAISED ABOUT THE VALIDITY OF THE TECHNIQUE WITH STUDIES SHOWING THE ABILITY OF THE OFFICE- TO DETECT DECEPTION AROUND 54% IT'S KIND OF THE SAME IS- FLIPPING A COIN- SB FOUR NINETY FOUR WILL HELP ENSURE OFFICERS ARE PROPERLY TRAINED IN THE PUBLIC SN'T SUBJECTED TO DEMEANING OR COURTSOF TACTICS THAT CAN RESULT IN FALSE CONFECTIONS SB FOUR NINETY FOUR WOULD REQUIRE OPPOSED TO CREATE IT IN A GREAT OFFICER TRAINING ON INTERVIEW TECHNIQUES THAT ARE MORE ETHICAL AND EFFECTIVE IT GETTING ACCURATE INFORMATION WHILE AVOIDING. FALSE CONFESSIONS.

TODAY IT'S NOT OFTEN THAT- SOME OF THOSE PROGRESS TO BE EIGHT AND MOST CONSERVATIVE DH COME TOGETHER BUT THEY HAVE ON THIS BILL IT'S ALSO NOT OFTEN THAT THAT GUY IS YOU KNOW THAT THE INNOCENCE PROJECT MODEL LINE- WITH THE VARIOUS DJS ON SOMETHING OF THIS NATURE BUT RESEARCHERS SHOWN THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS CAN BETTER SERVE THE COMMUNITY WHEN THEY'RE TRAINED ON SCIENCE BASED ETHICAL HUMAN INTERVIEWING ENGAGEMENT STRATEGIES I'D LIKE TO BRIEFLY MENTION TO YOU WHY I PERSONALLY AM SO COMMITTED THAT THE THIRTY YEAR PROSECUTOR TO SEE THIS THIS BILL- CHECK. PASSED AND- A CHANGE TO THE WAY WE TRAINED LAW ENFORCEMENT HERE IN THE STATE. OF CALIFORNIA- THE PROJECT PRO ME SOME YEARS AGO. AND REQUESTED A REVIEW OF INTERVIEW IN THE MURDER CONVICTION. MANY YEARS EARLIER AND AYE SIR DO ATTORNEY GENERAL WOULDN'T BOTHER BY THE INTERVIEW. OF THE SUSPECT'S GIRLFRIEND WHO ULTIMATELY CONFESSED TO PARTICIPATING IN THE BRUTAL MURDER OF A WOMAN IN IMPLICATED HER BOYFRIEND RICKY DAVIS. BUT TO BE HONEST I WAS SKEPTICAL OF THE CLAIM THAT HE WAS FACTUALLY INNOCENT. BUT I WAS WILLING TO BUCK I BOTHERED BY IT SUFFICIENTLY TO INITIATE- CONTINUED TESTING OF FORENSIC EVIDENCE- AND YEAH WE DID EXTENSIVE AMOUNT OF TESTING IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE SACRAMENTO COUNTY- CRIME LAB. OVER TIME OUR INVESTIGATORS AND ULTIMATELY USING GENETIC GENEALOGY WERE ABLE TO EXONERATE RICKY DAVIS. BUT NOTHING TO DO WITH WRECKAGE WRONGFUL CONVICTION AND INCARCERATION I FELT DUTY BOUND TO MEET WITH HIM IN CUSTODY IN PERSON AND APOLOGIZE. TO HIM FOR THE WRONGFUL CONVICTION AND TO SECURE IT HAS RELEASED. I ALSO MADE A COMMITMENT TO CHANGE THE WAY OUR OFFICERS ARE TRAINED. IN THE WAKE OF ENHANCED ENHANCED INTERROGATION REVELATIONS NO BOMB ADMINISTRATION COMMISSION A COMPREHENSIVE INVESTIGATION INTO INTELLIGENCE POLICE PRACTICES. THE RESEARCHERS WILL BE OAK MUCH OF WHAT WE HAVE BEEN TRAINING OFFICERS OF THE LAST SEVEN YEARS IT'S INEFFECTIVE AND LONG. IN OTHER WORDS RESEARCH INCLUDING MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED SEPARATE PEER REVIEWED STUDIES REVEALED AGGRESSIVE CONFESSION DRIVEN INTERROGATIONS ARE MISGUIDED AND INCREASE THE RISK OF FALSE. INFORMATION INCLUDING FALSE CONFESSIONS- ETHICAL REPORT BASED APPROACH IS GROUNDED IN FACT FINDING ORTRUTH SEEKING BETTER PROTECT. ALL MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC. RESEARCH REVEALS ALL POLICING CAN BENEFIT BY AND ONE PERSON PROFICIENT.

AND WE'RE GETTING NOBODY QUEUEING UP AT THIS TIME MISTER CHAIR WILL NOW BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS MISSED DIRTY LACKEY. YEAH FIRST OF ALL I'D LIKE TO- KIND OF CORRECT THE RECORD THE CASE THERE'S ANY MISUNDERSTANDING. THERE'S VERY LITTLE INSTRUCTION AT THE ACADEMY LEVEL. ON CONDUCTING INTERVIEW AND INTERROGATION. TECHNIQUES MOST OF THIS KIND OF- INSTRUCTION THERE'S FOR ADVANCED. INTERVIEW AND INTERROGATION CIRCUMSTANCE LIKE DETECTIVE OR ARE BEYOND THAT AND- I DO AGREE THAT- THERE'S BEEN SOME SUSPECT CIRCUMSTANCES RESULTING FROM THE STRAINING THERE THERE NEEDS TO BE ADJUSTMENTS MADE BUT I DO HAVE CONCERNS I AM GOING TO SUPPORT THIS BILL. FOR JUST BECAUSE OF- I THINK SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE. BUT I DO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT. THIS QUOTE UNQUOTE ADVANCED IN PERSONAL. COMMUNICATION SKILLS ARE EXACTLY WHAT THAT MEANS. NOT SURE WHAT THAT MEANS. AND I'VE CONDUCTED MORE THAN MY SHARE OF INTERVIEW AND INTERROGATIONS. I'M JUST A LITTLE BIT WORRIED AS LONG AS WE'RE GETTING TO THE TRUTH I THINK THAT NEEDS TO BE THE FOCUS. NOT THE- THE POLITICAL HANDLING OF THE WAY THAT- SO WE GET TO THE TRUTH I THINK THAT THAT'S REALLY WHAT THE PUBLIC DESERVES THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR- YES OUR K. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I JUST WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR YOU KNOW IN MY TIME DEFENDING INDIVIDUALS- THEY WERE ALLEGED COMMITTED CRIMES I SAW MY FAIR SHARE OF STATEMENTS TAKEN THAT DIDN'T SEEM WHOLLY TRUTHFUL SOME COURTS DEEMED UNTRUTHFUL AND I THINK THAT TO WHAT MY COLLEAGUE MR LACKEY SAID WHAT WE WANT MOST IS THE TRUTH AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO WITH THIS BILL IS GIVE THOSE MEN AND WOMEN ON THE FRONT LINES WHO ARE OUT THERE TO PROTECT OUR COMMUNITIES. AND TO ENSURE THAT ONLY THOSE WHO ARE GUILTY OR TRULY CHARGED AND CONVICTED FOR CRIMES THE TOOLS TO DO JUST THAT AND YOU KNOW I THINK THIS I AM NOT AN EXPERT IN WHAT THAT TECHNIQUE IS AND I HOPE THAT THIS REALLY IS GETTING OUT THE BEST WAY BUT I THINK THAT SHOULD BE AN ONGOING CONVERSATION BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT TOO MANY PEOPLE ARE SERVING TIME FOR CRIMES THEY DIDN'T COMMIT BECAUSE 1% IS TOO MANY AND SO I THINK YOU FOR THIS WORK AND- I'M- WITH FORTY SPORTING. THANK YOU ANY OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. YOU MAY CLOSE MISSED CENTER DOT OUTFIT THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN- I REALLY APPRECIATE THE ALL THE COMMENTS THERE HERE THIS MORNINGYOU KNOW THIS BILL AS I KIND OF MENTIONED THAT A DIFFERENT WAY BUT IT'S NO SILVER BULLET ALL BY ITSELF. IT'S NOT GOING TO CHANGE THE WORLD BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I WAS LOOKING AT THIS BILL WHETHER OR NOT I WAS GOING TO TAKE THIS BILL ON IT WORK THIS BILL THIS YEAR I JUST THOUGHT THIS IS JUST ONE OF THE KEY ELEMENTS. IN A LOT OF THE AREAS THAT ARE BEING WORKED ON IN OUR LEGISLATURE- THIS YEAR AND SOME- LAST YEAR I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU A CHURCH RECOMMEND THE I AND I WOULD. TAKE UP MISTER LACKEYS- SUGGESTING THAT YOU CLARIFY BECAUSE IT'S- IF YOU SET THE TWO OF US TOGETHER. I HAVE A VERY CLEAR UNDERSTANDING. WHO ARE YOU GETTING THAT AND- IT NOT SO MUCH. AND SO- AND PLUS OTHER **** HE SAID. I WANT THREE DECADES PLEASE ALLOW YEARS OF TRAINING I KNOW A LOT OF. IT UP RESEARCHERS SILVA. AS YOU BUT A I THINK HIS HIS ADVICE WOULD BE VERY VALUABLE AS WE MOVE FORWARD. I KEEP THE CHURCH RECOMMENDED I. SB FOUR NINETY FOUR BY SENATOR DODD THE MISSION IS DUE PASSED AS AMENDED TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER HI JONES SAWYER ATTY LACKEY. LACKEY I OUR CAN BARRICADE HAND I LEAD LEE BY COURT. MARK I SAN DIEGO. CA ARE TO WICKS WICKS I. THAT MEASURE PASSES THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS PROCEEDED THANK YOU. AND- FOR A LAST I REMEMBER EIGHT SENATOR ROTH SB. SIX TO NINE AND THAT WOULD BE IDENTIFICATION CARDS. THANK YOU REST THANK YOU MISTER MEMBERS AS YOU KNOW THIS BILL EXPANDS THE PATHWAYS FOR INMATES TO TAKE PART IN CDC OURS CAL ID PROGRAM- NEARLY EVERY INDIVIDUAL RELEASED FROM STATE PRISON FACES SIGNIFICANT BARRIERS TO SUCCESSFUL REENTRY AND THE LACK OF A VALID CALIFORNIA ID OR DRIVER'S LICENSE FOR THAT MATTER CAN EXCESS EXACERBATE THESE BARRIERS SEEKING MEDICAL CARE RECEIVING HOUSING ASSISTANCE. APPLYING FOR JOBS OPENING A BANK ACCOUNT WITHOUT A VALID ID NEARLY ALL OF THESE AND CERTAINLY NEWLY RELEASED INDIVIDUALS CAN BE LOCKED OUT OF CRUCIAL SERVICES AND OPPORTUNITIES TO SUCCEED. CDCR CURLY PROVIDES A PATHWAY FOR INMATES TO OBTAIN OUT KELLY DISEASES THEY APPROACH THEIR RELEASE BUT A REQUIREMENT IN THE STATUTE HAS PRECLUDED THOUSANDS OF THOSE WHO WERE OTHERWISE READY AN ELIGIBLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE KELLY D. PROGRAM FROM DOING SO. UNDER THE CURRENT STATUTE AGAIN AS YOU KNOW I'M SURE ELIGIBLE INMATES MUST HAVE AMONG OTHER REQUIREMENTS A USABLE PHOTO ON FILE WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES IT IS NO MORE THAN TEN YEARS OLD THIS IS PROVEN TO BE DIFFICULT IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE FOR THOSE INMATES RELEASED SOME OF THEM TO MEET PARTICULARLY FOR THOSE WHO ARE ELDERLY WHO HAVE SERVED LEAGUE THE LENGTHY SENTENCES OR WHO DID NOT POSSESS A CAL ID PRIOR TO SERVING THEIR SENTENCE. THE BILL ADDRESSES THIS BY AMENDING THE CURRENT PHOTO REQUIREMENT FOR CAL ID RENEWAL. TO ALLOW US ARE TO TAKE A NEW PHOTO FOR INMATES WHOSE DMV PHOTO WAS DEEMED UNUSABLE. IT ALSO EXTENDS A NEW PHOTO OPPORTUNITY TO THOSE WHO DID NOT POSSESS THE KELADI PRIOR TO THEIR INCARCERATION. AND EXTENDS THE EXISTING REDUCED FEE. OF EIGHT DOLLARS TO APPLY TO FIRST TIME ID APPLICANTS. MELT STRUCTURE YOU IN THE COMMITTEE SET US SOME PROPOSED AMENDMENTS- DESIGNED TO MORE CLOSELY ALIGN THIS BILL WITH THE BILL CURRENTLY CARRIED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER MARK STONE AB. SEVEN SEVENTEEN- I HAVE REVIEWED THE THOSE AMENDMENTS. I YOU KNOW I CERTAINLY RECOGNIZE THAT MY COLLEAGUE MEMBER STONE HAS BEEN A CHAMPION OF THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE OR THESE ISSUES FOR SEVERAL SEVERAL YEARS. AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT I AM COMPLETELY SUPPORTIVE OF ASSEMBLY BILL SEVEN SEVENTEEN AND THE GENERAL CONCEPTS CONTAINED- IN THAT BILL AND THEN THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS. THAT YOU AND THE COMMITTEE STAFF SAID TO ME. THERE ARE SOME POTENTIAL COST ISSUES WITH SOME OF THE PROVISIONS OF AB SEVEN SEVENTEEN. AND FRANKLY PRIOR TO INTRODUCING THIS PARTICULAR BILL. MY STAFF CONSULTED WITH MR STONE'S OFFICE ON HIS BILL AND THE PROPOSED BILL THAT WE INTENDED TO INTRODUCE. IF IT WORKED OUT- AND IN DOING SO WE DECIDED TO INTRODUCE THE BILL TO PROVIDE FRANKLY. A COST NEUTRAL ALTERNATIVE. AND TO SERVE AS A BACK UP TO HIS BILL IF FUNDING WAS NOT DEEMED APPROPRIATE OR COULD NOT BE SECURED. I HAVE SPOKEN TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE ON RECONCILING THE PROVISIONS OF AB SEVEN SEVENTEEN AND THIS BILL. AND I AM ABSOLUTELY WILLING TO WORK WITH HIM AS I TOLD HIM. ALONG WITH CDCR AND THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE BOTH OF WHOM ARE INVOLVED IN THIS ISSUE. TO TRY TO PUT THE DRIVER'S LICENSE COMPONENT BACK INTO THIS BILL THIS SENATE BILL. TO ELIMINATE THE FINES AND FEES ISSUE. THAT THIS BILL CURRENTLY HAS AND TO FIGURE SOME WAY TO PROVIDE DOCUMENT ASSISTANCE TO INDIVIDUAL SERVING- IN OUR PRISON SYSTEM RECOGNIZING THAT CDCR FRANKLY AT THIS POINT IS NOT PRESENTLY EQUIPPED. TO SERVICE A DOCUMENT RETRIEVAL SERVICE. SO WITH THAT I'M COMMITTED CERTAINLY TO DO THAT IF IT IS THE DESERVE YOU AND THIS COMMITTEE TO MOVE THIS BILL FORWARD TO X. NEXT STOP- IN THE CALIFORNIA ASSEMBLY. WITH ME TODAY I HAVE MISTER KEVIN HOFFMAN WHO WAS THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF PROGRAM OPERATIONS AT CDC OURS DIVISION OF REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS. SIMPLY TO ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS THAT YOU OR THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE MAY HAVE- AND WITH THAT AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME- I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE IF YOU DEEM THAT APPROPRIATE. OKAY DID MR CAUGHT HOFFMAN ONE MAKE A STATEMENT FOR PURPOSES OF DISCUSSION NOW MOVES THE BILL.

SO I'VE FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING WILLING TO TAKE THOSE CHANGES TO THE BILL- I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT COST THAT COULD BE AN ISSUE I THINK IT IS WOULD PROBABLY BE A GOOD IDEA. TO HAVE YOUR BILL AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO SEVEN ONE SEVEN SHOULD THE GOVERNOR TO SIGN THAT. CDC ARE IS NOT CAPABLE OR DOESN'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO DO THIS- THAT ALSO SEEMS TO BE WE'RE HEARING MANY OF THE SAME GROUPS WHO SUPPORTED SEVEN ONE SEVEN SUPPORTING YOUR BAIL. SO AT THE MOMENT AND I AM PREDISPOSED TO VOTING FOR IT I DO WANT TO HEAR WHAT THE- WHAT ARE CHAIR HAS TO SAY ABOUT IT BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW HIS POSITION YET. THANK YOU. MR LACKEY YEAH I- IN ITS CURRENT FORM I'M CLEARLY IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE- BUT YOU MIGHT BE TALKING ME OUT OF IT- EVENTUALLY EMERGING IT WAS SEVEN SEVENTEEN AND HERE'S HERE'S MY BIGGEST CONCERN OVER SEVEN SEVENTEEN. THE DRIVER'S LICENSE ISSUE- DOES NOT ADDRESS ANY KIND OF BEHIND THE WHEEL TRAINING AND I THINK THAT THAT'S A PUBLIC SAFETY VOID DEBTS- VERY COULD- VERY IMPORTANT. AND- SO HAVING A FORM OF A GOOD IDENTIFICATION IS CLEARLY SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED BUT NOT IN THE FORM OF A DRIVER'S LICENSE UNLESS THERE'S- A CERTAIN DEGREE OF COMPETENCY THAT'S DEMONSTRATED BEFORE ISSUING- THE DRIVING COMPONENT IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE MORE CRITICAL ASPECTS. OF THE- THE ASSESSMENT PROCESS BEFORE GETTING A DRIVER'S LICENSE AND- IT WOULD CLEARLY JUST BE DISMISSED OR OVERLOOKED. AND I FIND THAT TO BE UNACCEPTABLE BUT IN THIS CURRENT FORM I'M CLEARLY IN SUPPORT AND I THINK IT IT ADDRESSES A VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM THANK YOU. ANYWHERE I MAY RESPOND SURE. WELL SIR I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH YOU I WAS NOT IN THE- CONSTRUCTION FOR PHASE OF ASSEMBLY BILL SEVEN SEVENTEEN WOULD SEEM TO ME THAT THE DRIVER'S LICENSE COPONENT WOULD HAVE TO BE A RENEWAL COMPONENT. FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO PREVIOUSLY. I HAVE. HAD A DRIVER CALIFORNIA DRIVER'S LICENSE AND SIMPLY HAD HAVE LET IT EXPIRE AND NEEDED TO BE RENEWED IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING BUT I CERTAINLY DEFER TO YOU AND YOUR DECADES OF EXPERIENCE THAT. HAVING HAD A CALIFORNIA DRIVER'S LICENSE ONCE IT'S EXPIRED. YOU MAY RENEW IT YOU MAY HAVE TO TAKE A WRITTEN TEST BUT YOU'RE NOT REQUIRED. TO TAKEN ON THE ROAD TEST AGAIN AND IF THAT'S THE CASE THEN WE SHOULD PROBABLY SHOULDN'T TREAT- INMATES EXITING OUR CORRECTIONS SYSTEM ANY DIFFERENTLY THAN WE TREAT ANY OTHER. RESIDENTS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THAT WOULD CERTAINLY BE MY INTENT SO HOPEFULLY. HOPEFULLY I KEEP YOU IN THE EYE COLUMN. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER COMMENTS. YOU MAY CLOSE JUST RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE AND I APPRECIATE YOUR PATIENCE- MISTER MEMBERS AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR CONSIDERING EVERYTHING AND I KNOW PASSED THE BALANCED- WITH BUDGET CONCERNS AND END UP WHAT I REALLY WANTED WAS A DISCUSSION WHICH YOU'RE WILLING TO HAVE WITH THE ALL PARTIES CONCERNED- WITHOUT DISASSEMBLY SILENCE OF THE THINGS WE WANT WHAT WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO THAT IN OUR I'LL JUST THROW IN THERE AND- WITH THE GOVERNOR'S TRIED TRYING TO MOVE THIS BALL LAW. YOU DON'T KNOW THAT WE'VE BEEN THOSE OF US HAVE BEEN HERE SINCE TWENTY TWELVE WOMEN TRYING TO GET THIS DONE. FOR A LONG TIME. IN BETWEEN CDC ARE. DMB HAVE BEEN THE MOST FRUSTRATING. ROOP TO TRY TO GET THIS DONE AND SO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET AS MUCH DONE AS PHYSICALLY POSSIBLE EVEN NOW SITTING IN HERE JUST HAVING THIS DISCUSSION OF MAY ADD MORE COSTS BUT EVEN JUST A DISCUSSION ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO DRIVE. IMMIGRANTS INCARCERATED SO LONG AS YOU ARE YOU STARTED WHEN YOU WERE SO YOUNG YOU MAY NOT KNOW HOW TO DRIVE AND SO I'M NOT TRYING TO ADD MORE COST TO IT BUT THAT HE BE A THAT IS. A VALID CONCERN THAT WE MAY HAVE TO LOOK AT IN THE BILL SO I HOPE WE CAN GET WE CAN KEEP MOVE THE BALLDOWN THE ROAD WE GET SOMETHING A LITTLE MORE- AND- IT AS WE MOVE FORWARD AND HOPEFULLY OAST THOSE DISCUSSIONS WITH ALL PARTIES CONCERNED. BECAUSE WE ALL WANT TO HAVE PEOPLE COME OUT AND BE ABLE TO GET A DRIVER'S LICENSE HAVE AN ID BE ABLE TO GET A JOB WHERE THEY MAY HAVE TO DRIVE AND TO BE OF CITIZENS THAT HAVE. DIPPED RIDLEY CALL RETURNING CITIZENS THAT THEY REALLY FEEL LIKE TO RETURNING CITIZENS TO SOCIETY I DO YOU HAVE THAT INTENT MR STONE HAS THE SAME INTENT AND EVEN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE HAS THE SAME OBJECTIVE AND SO THAT'S WHY SHE JUST NEEDED TO GET EVERYBODY. IN A ROOM AND SEE WHAT. YOU CAN AND CAN'T WORK AFTER SOME THINGS. EVEN NOW WITH THE BY PART IS YOU KNOW WHERE. WE WERE STRUGGLING. WITH THAT IN THE BIG PICTURE THE TEN THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT PITCHER. I JUST THINK DIGITAL SMALL PIECE BUT THAT'S THE SENIOR HERE THERE AND IF YOU NEED. THIS COMMITTEE OR ANYONE OF US TO HELP. MOVE THIS ALONG- THE JUDGE RECOMMENDED ICE ROUTE IF YOU CAN HELP US MOVE THIS ALONG- WE WILL BE MORE THAN WILLING TO HELP COULD THIS IS THAT IMPORTANT TO US. AGAIN I WANT THANK YOU FOR.
