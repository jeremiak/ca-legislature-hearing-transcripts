QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE MISTER

00:28:49.861 --> 00:28:52.497
OBERNOLTE.

00:28:52.564 --> 00:28:53.665
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SOUGHT A

00:28:53.731 --> 00:28:54.732
QUESTION ABOUT THE CAP AND TRADE

EXPENDITURE PLAN.

CAN YOU GO THROUGH WITH US THE

00:28:58.369 --> 00:28:59.904
RATIONALE THAT YOU USED IN

00:28:59.971 --> 00:29:01.739
ALLOCATING MONEY TO DIFFERENT BY

00:29:01.806 --> 00:29:04.109
PROGRAMS FROM CAPITA RATE.

00:29:04.175 --> 00:29:05.877
SURE I'M I THINK GENERALLY

00:29:05.944 --> 00:29:07.178
YOU'LL SEE WHEN WE DO DISPLAYS

00:29:07.245 --> 00:29:09.547
WE LOOK AT AND THE ENACTING

00:29:09.614 --> 00:29:10.415
LEGISLATION HAD SEVERAL

00:29:10.482 --> 00:29:12.250
DIFFERENT CATEGORIES LISTED FOR

00:29:12.317 --> 00:29:13.518
CAP AND TRADE EXPENDITURES IN

00:29:13.585 --> 00:29:15.253
THOSE THINGS INCLUDE THINGS LIKE

00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:16.721
AIR TOXIC AND CLIMATE AIR

00:29:16.788 --> 00:29:17.956
POLLUTANTS.

00:29:18.022 --> 00:29:19.424
AS WELL AS RESEARCH IS THAT WE

00:29:19.491 --> 00:29:21.292
LOOK AT THOSE CATEGORIES WHEN WE

00:29:21.359 --> 00:29:23.228
PUT TOGETHER THIS EXPENDITURE

00:29:23.294 --> 00:29:24.395
PLAN OF COURSE IT'S PART OF A

00:29:24.462 --> 00:29:25.597
NEGOTIATED AGREEMENT WITH

00:29:25.663 --> 00:29:27.198
LEGISLATIVE LEADERSHIP AND SO

00:29:27.265 --> 00:29:28.433
THERE'S ALWAYS SOME COMPROMISES

00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:29.701
WHILE SPARS SCENE OF DOLLAR

00:29:29.767 --> 00:29:30.768
AMOUNTS WITHIN THOSE.

00:29:30.835 --> 00:29:32.270
BROAD CATEGORIES BUT THESE ARE

00:29:32.337 --> 00:29:34.672
SUPPOSED TO USE FOR GREENHOUSE

00:29:34.739 --> 00:29:35.140
GAS REDUCTION ZACHAREK

00:29:35.206 --> 00:29:35.440
[inaudible]

00:29:35.507 --> 00:29:37.509
THAT'S CORRECT.

00:29:37.575 --> 00:29:40.545
SO WHEN WHEN I LOOK AT SPENDING

00:29:40.612 --> 00:29:41.579
TAXPAYER MONEY FOR GREENHOUSE

00:29:41.646 --> 00:29:43.014
GAS REDUCTION.

00:29:43.081 --> 00:29:44.516
I THINK THAT TO BE GOOD STEWARDS

00:29:44.582 --> 00:29:45.917
OF THAT MONEY WE NEED TO LOOK AT

00:29:45.984 --> 00:29:46.818
THE EFFICIENCY OF OUR SPENDING

00:29:46.885 --> 00:29:49.687
AND IN THIS CASE EFFICIENCIES

00:29:49.754 --> 00:29:51.489
REALLY EASY TO CALCULATE BECAUSE

00:29:51.556 --> 00:29:52.157
YOU JUST TAKE A TOTAL COST OF A

00:29:52.223 --> 00:29:52.891
PROGRAM.

00:29:52.957 --> 00:29:54.259
IN DOLLARS YOU DIVIDE BY THE

00:29:54.325 --> 00:29:55.593
NUMBER OF TONS OF CARBON IT

00:29:55.660 --> 00:29:56.661
REDUCES AND YOU GET THE PRICE

00:29:56.728 --> 00:29:58.396
PER TONNE --

00:29:58.463 --> 00:30:00.565
THAT ACOSTA REDUCE THAT AND I

00:30:00.632 --> 00:30:01.733
WAS JUST STRUCK LOOKING AT THE

00:30:01.799 --> 00:30:03.034
EXPENDITURE PLANET THE WIDE

00:30:03.101 --> 00:30:03.668
VARIETY OF DIFFERENT

00:30:03.735 --> 00:30:05.203
EFFICIENCIES BECAUSE WE GOT SOME

00:30:05.270 --> 00:30:06.304
PROGRAMS WERE FUNDING THAT ARE

00:30:06.371 --> 00:30:08.473
VERY EFFICIENT I MEAN I HEALTHY

00:30:08.540 --> 00:30:10.542
FOREST A DAIRY DIE JESTERS --

00:30:10.608 --> 00:30:12.377
ORGANIC RECYCLING ALL OF THOSE

00:30:12.443 --> 00:30:13.611
ARE UNDER TEN DOLLARS PER TON OF

00:30:13.678 --> 00:30:15.079
CARBON REDUCED BUT THEN WE GOT

00:30:15.146 --> 00:30:16.347
THINGS LIKE THE CLEAN VEHICLE

00:30:16.414 --> 00:30:18.283
REBATE PROGRAM WHICH IS FORTY

00:30:18.349 --> 00:30:19.117
SIX DOLLARS PER TON THAT'S FOUR

00:30:19.184 --> 00:30:20.752
TIMES LESS EFFICIENT.

00:30:20.818 --> 00:30:21.252
AND THEN --

00:30:21.319 --> 00:30:24.389
THE CLEAN TRUCK AND BUS VOUCHER

00:30:24.455 --> 00:30:25.690
INCENTIVE PROGRAM WHICH IS OVER

00:30:25.757 --> 00:30:27.025
FORTY AND FIFTY DOLLARS PER TON

00:30:27.091 --> 00:30:28.493
WHICH IS OVER TEN TIMES LESS

00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:30.094
WHAT NO FORTY FORTY TIMES LESS

00:30:30.161 --> 00:30:30.995
EFFICIENT SO.

00:30:31.062 --> 00:30:32.197
THAT JUST STRUCK ME THAT THE

00:30:32.263 --> 00:30:34.399
VARIETY OF EFFICIENCIES THERE

00:30:34.465 --> 00:30:35.533
WHY NOT JUST TAKE THE MONEY I

00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:37.101
MEAN IF IF THE GOAL IS TO REDUCE

00:30:37.168 --> 00:30:39.404
GREENHOUSE GASES WITH THIS MONEY.

00:30:39.470 --> 00:30:40.305
AND THAT'S WERE CHARGED WITH

00:30:40.371 --> 00:30:42.040
DOING WHY NOT JUST ALLOCATE THEM

00:30:42.106 --> 00:30:43.508
TO THE MOST EFFICIENT USES USERS

00:30:43.575 --> 00:30:45.376
Y. WHILE THE OTHER THING I THINK

00:30:45.443 --> 00:30:46.844
THAT WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT OR

00:30:46.911 --> 00:30:48.112
PUTTING IT TOGETHER EXPENDITURE

00:30:48.179 --> 00:30:49.948
PLAN IS CURRENT EVENTS AND SO

00:30:50.014 --> 00:30:50.715
CLEARLY WE HAVE A PRETTY

00:30:50.782 --> 00:30:52.150
SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENT IN

00:30:52.217 --> 00:30:53.051
HEALTHY FORCE.

00:30:53.117 --> 00:30:55.153
THIS YEAR GIVEN WHAT HAPPENS ON

00:30:55.220 --> 00:30:57.889
RECENTLY ON PROBABLY --

00:30:57.956 --> 00:31:00.358
HIGHER THAN WE HAVE IN PAST YEAR

00:31:00.425 --> 00:31:02.060
HE IS ONE LENDS TO LOOK THROUGH

00:31:02.126 --> 00:31:03.094
THE ALSO THINK WE NEED TO LOOK

00:31:03.161 --> 00:31:05.063
AT MORE RECENT EVENTS TO SEE IF

00:31:05.129 --> 00:31:05.663
THERE ARE INVESTMENTS THAT WE

00:31:05.730 --> 00:31:06.698
SHOULD BE MADE.

00:31:06.764 --> 00:31:08.900
ON AN FORCES CERTAINLY A GREAT

00:31:08.967 --> 00:31:10.401
EXAMPLE OF THAT NIGHT FEEL GET

00:31:10.468 --> 00:31:12.003
NO ARGUMENT FROM ME BERMAN

00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:13.504
BECAUSE KURT WITH EVENTS WITH

00:31:13.571 --> 00:31:14.472
NOTWITHSTANDING.

00:31:14.539 --> 00:31:15.740
HEALTHY FORESTS ARE ONE OF MOST

00:31:15.807 --> 00:31:17.542
EFFICIENT USES OF GREENHOUSE GAS

00:31:17.609 --> 00:31:19.010
REDUCTION FUNDS IN TERMS OF

00:31:19.077 --> 00:31:20.511
DOLLARS SPENT PER TONS OF CARBON

00:31:20.578 --> 00:31:21.679
REDUCED I JUST WONDERED WHY.

00:31:21.746 --> 00:31:22.847
WE'RE SPENDING ALL OF THIS

00:31:22.914 --> 00:31:25.350
TAXPAYER MONEY ON YOU KNOW VERY

00:31:25.416 --> 00:31:26.618
INEFFICIENT USES.

00:31:26.684 --> 00:31:27.252
WHEN WE LOOK TO YOU THROUGH THE

00:31:27.318 --> 00:31:27.752
LINES OF GREENHOUSE GAS

00:31:27.819 --> 00:31:29.754
REDUCTION BUT DOC I MEAN THAT'S

00:31:29.821 --> 00:31:31.289
A RHETORICAL QUESTION I GUESS

00:31:31.356 --> 00:31:31.823
IT'S IT'S ONE OF THE BIG

00:31:31.889 --> 00:31:32.790
CONCERNS I HAVE THOUGH?

00:31:32.857 --> 00:31:33.992
AND I WOULD HOPE THAT IN FUTURE

00:31:34.058 --> 00:31:35.827
YEARS WE PAY MORE ATTENTION TO

00:31:35.893 --> 00:31:37.829
THAT EFFICIENCY WHEN WE ALLOCATE

00:31:37.895 --> 00:31:39.364
THIS MONEY BACK MISTER WHO OUGHT

00:31:39.430 --> 00:31:40.498
TO CRACK ANSWERED THE RHETORICAL

00:31:40.565 --> 00:31:42.600
QUESTION I THINK WE END UP --

00:31:42.667 --> 00:31:44.335
SPENDING THOSE CATEGORIES BASED

00:31:44.402 --> 00:31:45.903
ON AREAS WHERE THERE ARE

00:31:45.970 --> 00:31:48.006
SIGNIFICANT NEEDS AND

00:31:48.072 --> 00:31:50.074
IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED. FOR THAT SO

00:31:50.141 --> 00:31:50.508
FOR EXAMPLE IN THE

00:31:50.575 --> 00:31:50.975
TRANSPORTATION SECTOR

00:31:51.042 --> 00:31:52.443
TRANSPORTATION ACCOUNTS FOR

00:31:52.510 --> 00:31:53.811
ABOUT.

00:31:53.878 --> 00:31:56.214
40% OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS

00:31:56.281 --> 00:31:58.349
SO IF WE ONLY WERE TO FOCUS ON

00:31:58.416 --> 00:31:59.951
DIE JESTERS OR FOREST'S WE WENT

00:32:00.018 --> 00:32:00.618
TOUCH.

00:32:00.685 --> 00:32:01.953
ANY OF THE GREENHOUSE GAS

00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:03.354
EMISSIONS IN THE TRANSPORTATION

00:32:03.421 --> 00:32:05.323
SECTOR I THINK YOUR YOUR POINT

00:32:05.390 --> 00:32:06.691
ON NOW WAS TENURE CARD

00:32:06.758 --> 00:32:08.192
EFFICIENCIES I THINK IS YOU KNOW

00:32:08.259 --> 00:32:08.593
WELL.

00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:09.661
WELL STATED AND I THINK THAT

00:32:09.727 --> 00:32:11.129
THIS IS --

00:32:11.195 --> 00:32:12.163
THESE ARE PROGRAMS THAT WE

00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:15.533
CONTINUE TO TRY TO FIND THE MOST

00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:17.669
EFFICIENT WAY TO REDUCE OUR

00:32:17.735 --> 00:32:19.337
GREENHOUSE GAS IS NOT THE MOST

00:32:19.404 --> 00:32:20.505
EFFICIENT WAY WOULD JUST SIMPLY

00:32:20.571 --> 00:32:23.274
BE. TO TELL PEOPLE NOT TO DO

00:32:23.341 --> 00:32:25.209
SOMETHING AND I THINK THAT'S NOT

00:32:25.276 --> 00:32:27.278
ALWAYS THE MUST PRACTICAL WAY OF

00:32:27.345 --> 00:32:29.113
ACHIEVING THAT SO I THINK THAT

00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:29.914
WE DO.

00:32:29.981 --> 00:32:33.718
ARM HOW THESE PROGRAMS TIME TO

00:32:33.785 --> 00:32:36.954
IMPLEMENT AND AT TIMES --

00:32:37.021 --> 00:32:37.922
FOR THEY GET TO BE --

00:32:37.989 --> 00:32:40.091
MODIFY THE COMPLETE AND CONTINUE

00:32:40.158 --> 00:32:41.526
TO BE APPROVED THAT --

00:32:41.592 --> 00:32:43.928
OBVIOUSLY THE MORE IMPROVEMENT

00:32:43.995 --> 00:32:45.330
THAT WE HAVE IN REDUCING

00:32:45.396 --> 00:32:47.098
GREENHOUSE GASES.

00:32:47.165 --> 00:32:49.300
THEN IT IT BECOMES HARDER AND

00:32:49.367 --> 00:32:51.703
HARDER TO MOVE INTOAREAS THAT

00:32:51.769 --> 00:32:53.271
WE HAVEN'T MADE AS MUCH PROGRESS

00:32:53.338 --> 00:32:54.405
I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE

00:32:54.472 --> 00:32:55.440
REASONS WHY YOU DO SEE.

00:32:55.506 --> 00:32:58.676
OF A MENU OF OPTIONS FOR EXAMPLE

00:32:58.743 --> 00:33:00.511
I DON'T KNOW THAT WE COULD PUT A

00:33:00.578 --> 00:33:01.679
BILLION DOLLARS INTO THE DAIRY

00:33:01.746 --> 00:33:04.415
TIE JESTERS AND WHILE THEY ARE

00:33:04.482 --> 00:33:06.884
EFFICIENT ON THEY HAVE.

00:33:06.951 --> 00:33:07.552
A DIFFERENT LEVELS OF

00:33:07.618 --> 00:33:08.686
EFFICIENCIES DEPENDING ON THE

00:33:08.753 --> 00:33:10.621
SIZE OF THE FARMS AND WHERE THEY

00:33:10.688 --> 00:33:13.324
ARE PLACED SO AGAIN --

00:33:13.391 --> 00:33:14.759
I THINK YOUR POINT IS POINT IS

00:33:14.826 --> 00:33:16.127
WELL TAKEN IT'S SOMETHING THAT

00:33:16.194 --> 00:33:17.762
WE CAN TO CONTINUE --

00:33:17.829 --> 00:33:18.763
TO DELVE INTO AT THE COMMITTEE

00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:22.967
LEVEL BUT LIKE AND AGAIN I THINK

00:33:23.034 --> 00:33:25.570
THAT'S MISTER CHAIR NOTHING ON

00:33:25.636 --> 00:33:26.871
THAT WOULD BE CAREFUL WITH THAT

00:33:26.938 --> 00:33:27.939
SPECIAL THE DIGEST HERS I THE

00:33:28.005 --> 00:33:29.140
MOST ADJUSTERS IN.

00:33:29.207 --> 00:33:31.442
CALIFORNIA MY DISTRICT.

00:33:31.509 --> 00:33:33.444
BECAUSE MONEY HAS VERY LOW RATES

00:33:33.511 --> 00:33:34.278
AND THINK ABOUT SOME THINGS

00:33:34.345 --> 00:33:36.247
WE'VE DONE FOR OUR DAIRY HERDS --

00:33:36.314 --> 00:33:38.349
FARR'S FEW YEARS AGO AT ABOUT XP

00:33:38.416 --> 00:33:39.951
THOUGH LOIS AND ABOUT IT RATE IN

00:33:40.017 --> 00:33:41.719
THE NATION.

00:33:41.786 --> 00:33:42.453
BUT WE DON'T DRIVE OUR DEAREST

00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:43.921
OF CALIFORNIA.

00:33:43.988 --> 00:33:45.556
IN THE GARDEN MILK PRODUCTS FROM

00:33:45.623 --> 00:33:46.958
ELSEWHERE THAT IS A REAL ISSUE

00:33:47.024 --> 00:33:49.927
THE THREAT WITH THAT.

00:33:49.994 --> 00:33:50.561
AND THEN ALSO YOU CAN SEE V. RP

00:33:50.628 --> 00:33:51.963
[inaudible] FOR LONGTIME.

00:33:52.029 --> 00:33:52.530
THE MONEY WENT BACK TO RICH

00:33:52.597 --> 00:33:54.832
FOLKS FOLKS THAT.

00:33:54.899 --> 00:33:55.600
