FOR IT SO -- I THINK JUST THREE DEPARTMENT IT'S A IT'S JUST AN OVERVIEW -- THIS IS THE JUSTIN OVER YOU VIEW YOU DO A LOT OF VERY IMPORTANT WORK WE DO HAVE A FAIRLY -- A GOOD WRITE UP ABOUT IT BUT IF YOU CAN HIT SERVE THE HIGHLIGHTS OF WHAT YOU'RE DEPARTMENTS DOING AND WHAT YOU'RE ACCOMPLISHING AND WHAT YOU HOPE PLANNED ACCOMPLISH NEXT YEAR [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. THE DEPARTMENT IS PRIMARILY FEDERALLY FUNDED WITH SOME GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUNDING AND ALL OF THE DEPARTMENTS FUNDING WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT PROVIDE SERVICES AND SUPPORT TO THOSE LIVING IN POVERTY AND STRUGGLING TO MAKE ENDS MEET. AS NOTED IN THE AGENDA FEDERAL FUNDING HAS REMAINED RELATIVELY CONSISTENT. THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASE IN THE FUNDING FOR THE LOW INCOME HOME ENERGY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. CALIFORNIA RECEIVED TWO HUNDRED AND FOUR MILLION FOR FEDERAL FISCAL YEAR TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN WHICH WAS AN INCREASE OF THIRTEEN POINT TWO FROM LAST YEAR AND THE ACTUAL THIRTY THREE AND A HALF INCREASE FROM FEDERAL FISCAL YEAR. SEVENTEEN THE COMMUNITY SERVICES BLOCK GRANTS FOR FEDERAL FISCAL YEAR NINETEEN IS A POSSIBLY SIXTY THREE AND A HALF MILLION AND THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY WEATHERIZATION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. SEVEN AND HALF MILLION. THE PRESIDENT'S PROPOSED TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET RECOMMENDS ELIMINATING ALL OF OUR PROGRAMS. HOWEVER HISTORICALLY CONGRESS HAS BEEN VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THESE FEDERAL PROGRAMS SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN CST HAS BEEN APPROPRIATED TWO HUNDRED AND TWO MILLION FROM THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND. FOR OUR LOW INCOME WEATHERIZATION PROGRAM. TEN AND A HALF MILLION OF THE TOTAL WILL BE AWARDED IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS FOR OUR FARM WORKER HOUSING COMPONENT. THE BALANCE HAS EITHER BEEN EXPENDED OR A WORD. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET INCLUDES TEN MILLION FOR THE LOW INCOME WEATHERIZATION PROGRAM HOW THESE FUNDS WILL BE USED WILL DEPEND ON THE FINAL APPROPRIATION. AND ANY PRIORITIES THAT MAY BE IDENTIFIED THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS. THE COMMUNITY SERVICES BLOCK GRANT IS UNIQUE IN THAT IT ALLOWS LOCAL AGENCIES TO PROVIDE A RANGE OF SERVICES AND SUPPORTS TO HELP LOW INCOME PEOPLE ATTAIN ECONOMIC STABILITY. THE SERVICES ARE BASED ON LOW INCOME. ON LOCAL NEEDS OF A AND INCLUDE WHICH IS REALLY IMPORTANT THE LOW INCOME COMMUNITY DIRECTLY ACTUALLY SITTING IN ON PART OF THE BOARDS FOR THE COMMUNITY ACTION AGENCIES. ABOUT TWO MILLION LOW INCOME. CALIFORNIANS ARE SERVED ANNUALLY. THE LOW INCOME HOME ENERGY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM HELPS LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS REDUCE THEIR HOME ENERGY COSTS BY PROVIDING PAYMENT ASSISTANCE CRISIS ASSISTANCE TO PREVENT UTILITY DISCONNECTION. AND WHETHER IS ASIAN SERVICES THAT HELP REDUCE ENERGY COSTS AND IMPROVE HOUSEHOLD ENERGY EFFICIENCY WHILE IMPROVING THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF OCCUPANTS. LAST YEAR LOCAL AGENCIES ASSISTED OVER TWO HUNDRED AND TEN THOUSAND HOUSEHOLDS PAY THEIR UTILITY BILLS INCLUDING MORE THAN NINETY SEVEN THOUSAND AND CRISIS SERVICES. AND IMPROVED ENERGY EFFICIENCY OF TWELFTH OVER TWELVE THOUSAND HOMES. MANY OF THESE HOUSEHOLDS INCLUDE ELDERLY DISABLED AND OR CHILDREN UNDER. FIVE THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUNDED LOW INCOME WEATHERIZATION PROGRAM PROVIDES ENERGY EFFICIENCY UPGRADES AND SOLAR PHOTOVOLTAIC SYSTEMS TO LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. THE PRIMARY GOAL OF THE PROGRAM IS TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS BUT JUST AS IMPORTANTLY. THE LOW INCOME WATHERIZATION PROGRAM REDUCES ENERGY EXPENSES FOR LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS FREEING UP LIMITED DISPOSABLE INCOME FOR OTHER CRITICAL EXPENSES. THIS IS THE ONLY PROGRAM OF ITS KIND IN CALIFORNIA PROVIDING LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS WITH SOLAR PHOTOVOLTAIC AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY UPGRADES AT NO COST. THERE'S A TOTAL OF FOUR COMPONENTS TO THE LOW. INCOME WEATHERIZATION PROGRAM THE FIRST IS OUR SINGLE FAMILY ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND SOLAR PEAVEY. OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS FIFTY SEVEN MILLION HAS BEEN ALLOCATED AND OVER FIFTEEN THOUSAND HOUSEHOLDS SERVED THROUGH ENERGY EFFICIENCY UPGRADES. AND OVER FORTY TWO HUNDRED HOUSEHOLDS HAVE RECEIVED SOLAR PEAVEY SYSTEMS. THE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES RECEIVING THE SERVICES ARE MADE UPOF FIVE REGIONS IN THE STATE. AND FOR THE FIVE REGIONS FUNDING HAS BEEN EXPENDED AND THE FIFTH REGION WILL BE FULLY EXPENDED BY THE END OF THIS MONTH. CONTINUATION OF THE SINGLE FAMILY AND SOLAR PEAVEY SERVICES IN DISADVANTAGED CAN UNITIES IS DEPENDENT UPON FUTURE FUNDING. THE SECOND COMPONENT OF THE PROGRAM PROVIDES TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND INCENTIVES FOR THE INSTALLATION OF ENERGY EFFICIENCY MEASURES AND SOLAR PEAVEY AND LOW INCOME MULTI FAMILY DWELLINGS. AND PROVIDES A DIRECT BENEFIT TO LOW INCOME TENANTS WHILE ALSO HELPING TO PRESERVE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. A TOTAL OF FIFTY FOUR MILLION HAS BEEN ALLOCATED. TO DATE FIFTY SEVEN HUNDRED HOUSEHOLDS HAVE BEEN SERVED AND THE DEPARTMENT ESTIMATES THAT PROJECTS WILL BE FULLY AND ROLLED BY JUNE. THE ENROLLMENT OF ADDITIONAL MULTI FAMILY PROJECTS IS CONTINGENT UPON FUTURE FUNDING. TWO NEW COMPONENTS OF THE LOW INCOME WEATHERIZATION PROGRAM OR THE COMMUNITY SOLAR PILOT AND THE FARM WORKER HOUSING THE PILOT IS DESIGNED TO EXPAND ACCESS TO RENEWABLE ENERGY FOR LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. INCLUDING THOSE THAT DO NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO PARTICIPATE IN THE EXISTING LOW INCOME SOLAR PEAVEY. EITHER DUE TO A LACK OF HOMEOWNERSHIP INADEQUATE ROOFING OR OTHER FACTORS. GREAT ALTERNATIVES IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE SANTA ROSA BAND OF COLA INDIANS IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY WAS AWARDED A LITTLE OVER TWO MILLION DOLLARS TO BENEFIT TRIBAL AND LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. GRID ALSO IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE PORT OF RICHMOND WAS AWARDED. ABOUT TWO POINT FOUR MILLION FOR A PROJECT THAT WILL BENEFIT LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS IN RICHMOND'S DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND THE CONTRACTS WILL BE AWARDED IN APRIL. FARM WORKER HOUSING WILL PROVIDE ENERGY EFFICIENCY MEASURES AND SOLAR PEAVEY SYSTEMS AND SINGLE FAMILY FARM WORKER HOMES ACROSS TWELVE COUNTIES IN THE STATE WITH THE HIGHEST FARM WORKER POPULATIONS. TEN AND A HALF MILLION WILL BE AWARDED NEXT MONTH. AND THEN FINALLY THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT AS YOU KNOW IS ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE ANTI POVERTY TOOLS IN THE DEPARTMENT CONTINUES TO LEAD A WORK GROUP OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE AGENCIES COMMITTED TO EXPANDING THE NUMBER OF CALIFORNIANS CLAIMING THE CREDIT. THE DEPARTMENT ALSO CONTINUES TO PARTNER WITH THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD TO ADMINISTER THE CALIFORNIA EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT EDUCATION AND OUTREACH GRANTS. AS WELL AS THE NEW FREE TAX PREPARATION ASSISTANCE GRANTS. FOR THE THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN TAX YEARS USED TO PROVIDE FUNDING TO LOCAL AGENCIES THROUGH COMPETITIVE GROUND AWARDS EIGHTEEN WERE AWARDED FOR THE EDUCATION AND OUTREACH AND FIFTEEN TO SUPPORT OF THE FREE TAX PREPARATION ASSISTANCE. AND IN CLOSING I JUST WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE WORK OF THE COMMUNITY ACTION AGENCIES AS WELL AS OTHER NONPROFIT AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES THAT WORK TO ALLEVIATE THE CAUSES AND CONDITIONS OF POVERTY. AND THEIR COMMUNITIES AND ARE COMMITTED TO STRENGTHENING THE ECONOMIC SECURITY FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS THANK YOU AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY COMES FROM ELIA [inaudible] FINANCE [inaudible] COMMITTEE MEMBERS. pSO FIRST OF ALL -- IN TERMS OF THE COMMITTEE SERVICES OF BLOCK GRANTS I MEAN YOU'RE DOING A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT PROGRAMS HOW HOW DOES YOUR DEPARTMENT SO HOMELESSNESS DRESSING HOMELESSNESS AND HOUSING IS A BIG ISSUE -- ENOUGH FOR THE ONLY FOR THE LEGISLATURE FOR FOR THE GOVERNOR -- HOW DOES YOUR AGENCY INTERFACE WITH OUR VARIOUS EFFORTS THAT WERE DOING ITS STATE AND LOCAL LEVEL -- IT TO TRY ADDRESS -- HOMELESSNESS GIVEN THE FACT THAT YOU'RE DOING THESE PROGRAMS ON WELL WRITER FOR PROGRAMS THIS. THE AS I SAID THE UNIQUENESS OF THE COMMUNITY SERVICES BLOCK GRANT REALLY DOES ALLOW A LOCAL AGENCY TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITY. SOME OF OUR AGENCIES FOR EXAMPLE IN SAN LUIS OBISPO THE COMMUNITY ACTION AGENCY THERE HAS A AN ACTUAL SHELTERS IN WHICH THEY PROVIDE -- HOUSING FOR HOMELESS -- WE ISSUED FUNDING FOR THE RECENTLY IN WHICH THEY WERE ABLE TO BUY COTTS FOR FOR THE SHELTER SO IT IS VERY DEPENDENT UPON EACH LOCAL AGENCY AND WHAT THE THE LOCAL COMMUNITY ALREADY MAY HAVE IN THE COMMUNITY THAT IS ADDRESSING THAT NEED. BUT THEY'RE DEFINITELY DEFINITELY AT THE FOREFRONT OF ADDRESSING THOSE ISSUES TO THE TO THE DEGREE THAT I GUESS THE QUESTION IS AND NO ONE ONE HAND THE THE I THINK FIFTY NINE COMMUNITY ACTION AGENCIES HOPEFULLY. IS AT THAT. IN IN YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM RIGHTS YOU'RE GIVING OUT THE GRANTS -- VISIBLE IS THIS DEPARTMENT USUALLY AT THE TABLE AND DISCUSSIONS ABOUT HOMELESSNESS AND DO YOU I GUESS DIRECTIVES NOT THE RIGHT WORD BUT IN TERMS OF GUIDANCE -- TO THESE AGENCIES AN OBJECT AND THAT THE AGENCY SHOULD BE INVOLVED THEIR BEACH. I I'M INDUSTRY A BETTER HANDLE ON I'M SURE THE COMMITTEE ACTION AGENCIES ARE DOING A LOT OF WONDERFUL WORK. I'M JUST TRYING TO THINK ABOUT HOW HOW WE ARE DAY AT THE TABLE LOCALLY ARE THEY STILL AT THE ASK DOT EIGHT TABLE LOCALLY TO WHAT DEGREE IS THIS DEPARTMENT AT THE TABLE AND THAT DISCUSSIONS AT THE STATE AND AND DO YOU THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THIS DEPARTMENT SHOULD BE. GIVEN THE WORK YOU DO AND EXACTLY WHAT'S RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOUR AGENCY ITEGRANTES WHEN IT COMES TO TRYING TO MOVE THE NEEDLE. ON THESE ISSUES. YES EACH AGENCIES -- PROVIDES TO THE DEPARTMENT EVERY OTHER YEAR -- THE COMMUNITY ACTION PLAN SO THE DEPARTMENT RCEIVES A PLANS THOSE ARE THE PLANS THAT THEN GO IN WHEN WE HAVE OUR ASSEMBLY AND SENATE -- HUMAN SERVICES COMMITTEE AND WE PRESENT THE STATE PLAN. AND SO THOSE -- BOB PLANS ARE REVIEWED BY THE DEPARTMENT IT'S I THINK TO THE DEGREE THAT WE SEE THAT THERE'S A AND IS AN ADDITIONAL NEEDS AT THE LOCAL COMMUNITY WE TRY TO HELP THEM IN ANY KIND OF BUREAUCRACY THAT THEY MAY HAVE BUT IT'S DEFINITELY -- A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BEING A STATE ORGANIZATION HELPING TO ENSURE THAT FUNDING ARE USED APPROPRIATELY AND STILL ALLOWING FOR THAT LOCAL FLEXIBILITY WHICH IS REALLY IMPORTANT WHAT THESE DOLLARS. BUT WE DO FOR INSTANCE HAVE SOME -- WHAT'S CALLED DISCRETIONARY DOLLARS WITH THE COMMUNITY SERVICES BLOCK GRANT AND WE'VE DONE TARGETED INITIATIVES WHERE WE'VE IDENTIFIED HOUSING -- ISSUES -- EMPLOYMENT ISSUES AS WELL AS THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT SO IT'S IT'S A UNIQUE RELATIONSHIP BECAUSE IT IS SO -- LOCALLY CONTROLLED BUT TO THE DOES THE WHEN THERE'S TASK FORCE OR OTHER EFFORTS AT THE STATE LEVEL AGAIN THAT PARTNERSHIP SIMILAR TO THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT. THE DEPARTMENT ALSO PARTICIPATES TO THE DEGREE THAT WE HAVE ANY DIRECT FUNDING OR DIRECT ABILITY TO SAY THAT. IT'S HARD BECAUSE IT'S NOT EXACTLY A PROGRAM IS A FUN SOURCE AND THEIR AGENCY BRINGS AND ALL SORTS OF REVENUE FROM ALL SORTS OF PHILANTHROPIC LITTLE THAT SAYS EIGHTY ANY YOU ARE TO CHANNEL FOR THE ELF Là FEDERAL FUNDS I MEAN WE WERE ONLY DOING TEN MILLION FROM THE STATE'S. SELLIER BUDGETS NEARLY FEDERAL BUT I'M JUST TRYING TO GET A SENSE OF YEAH HOW YOU JUST SAY. PASTEURIZATION ARE IS THERE YOU KNOW AT THAT THE I MEAN. ASIDE FROM JUST LIKE -- HERE'S THE MONEY I MEAN YOU'D REFUSING TO MEET THE PLANS AND SO FORTH AND JUST TRY TO THINK ABOUT WHAT'S THE PROCESS BY WHICH WE PROVIDE SOME AND AGAIN I RECOGNIZE THAT -- THERE'S STILL A DIFFERENT COMMITTEES ARE DIFFERENT AND AND THAT THE PEOPLE ON THE CLOSER TO THE GROUND HAVE A BETTER IDEA WHAT'S. AND IN TERMS OF BUT JUST. THAT'S BECAUSE I WENT YOU KNOW YOU TALK ABOUT THE FEDERAL LEVEL -- THE LEAST THERE SOME PEOPLE HOPEFULLY NOT SUCCESSFULLY ONE OF LINE OUT. THE BODY RIGHT NAY TODAY THEN -- IN THE BUDGET SO THE ADMINISTRATION SO I AND I DID IT JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT LIKE IN TERMS OF ACCOUNTABILITY LIKE OKAY IN AND YOU DID REALLY LIKE OKAY WE PUT UP THIS MONEY HERE TO SAY BUT WHAT WHAT ARE THE OUTCOME IN THE RESULTS AND WHAT. TO WHAT DEGREE IS THIS MONEY HELPING SOLVE SOME OF THESE BIGGER THESE THESE LARGER ISSUES. AND YOU SEEM TO BE THE TYPES OF ACTIVITIES IN THE WELL SUITED TO NOT SOLVE THE ENTIRE ISSUE BUT TO CONTRIBUTE. AND IN MANY WAYS AND HOW CAN WE TRY TO COMPILE THAT INFORMATION IN A WAY THAT -- THAT SHOWS THE VALUE OF OF THE OF OF THE MONEY THAT -- IS THAT THAT'S BEEN GRANTED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THE BENEFITS THAT SO. YEAH AND AND WE WE DO GET DEMOGRAPHIC DATA THAT SHOWS THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED AS I SAID IN THE TESTIMONY ABOUT TWO MILLION INDIVIDUALS ARE SERVED ANNUALLY. BUT AGAIN IT IS THE WHAT MAKES IT WORK SO WELL IS THE FACT THAT THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST OF FLEXIBLE FUND SOURCE FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND IT ALLOWS THE AGENCY TO REALLY LEVERAGE AND AGAINST ALL SORTS OF FEDERAL PROGRAMS AND AND LOCAL DOLLARS THAT THEY HAVE -- BUT WE DO OVERSEE THEM AND THE EXPENDITURE pSAME TYPE OF RELATIONSHIP IT WOULD BE IF IT WAS IN STATE STATUTE THAT WERE. PROVIDING A HOUSING PROGRAM OR DOING SOMETHING SPECIFIC BUT THERE THEY DO FOOD BANKS THEY DO ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT PROGRAMS USING REALLY OVERALL A SMALL AMOUNT OF FEDERAL DOLLARS AND IT WAS. SIXTY THREE YEAH I GUESS I'M SAYING IS I MEAN THERE'S THERE'S THE OKAY WHAT THE FISCAL ROLE IN DID YOU DOT ALL THE I'S AND TEASING YEP INVOICES FOR EVERYTHING AND THEN THERE'S THE STORIES THAT I CAN TELL RIGHT THE THINGS TO ACCOMPLISH IS A VERY IMPORTANT THING THAT. WE FIND A WAY TO BETTER CAPTURE THE STORIES IN ADDITION TO KNOWING THAT THE INVOICE EVERYTHING CORRECTLY -- DEFINITELY AND AND WE DO DO THAT WE CAN COLLECT THE STORIES AGAIN AND HAVE THAT. AVAILABLE AND AND DEFINITELY SURE THAT INFORMATION OKAY. WITH ALL RIGHT SUBCOMMITTEE OKAY SO FULL AND THEN THE OTHER QUESTION WAS -- YEAH GREAT WE'RE GETTING SOLAR AND OTHER THINGS TO LOW INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS I WAS ACTUALLY EIGHT THAT -- CEREMONY SEVERAL YEARS AGO -- I THINK THIS ONE THE QUESTION I HAVE IS I DON'T IT'S SORT OF WE DO SOMETHING TO PUT MONEY WE BUILD THINGS -- AND THEN IF IT'S A LOW INCOME NEIGHBORHOOD LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS THERE'S MAINTENANCE NOW SOLAR. PANEL SUNSHINE'S BUT STILL -- IS IT D. IT'S IT IS THERE ANY SORT OF FOLLOW UP AT ANY CONCERNED I MEAN. THOSE ARE ANY HELP IN TERMS OF SOMETHING BREAKS IS OF FOURTH THAT WE DON'T END UP WITH WE PUT A BUNCH OF MONEY IN SOMETHING BROKE AND THEY JUST CAN'T FIX IT THEY DON'T HAVE THE WHEREWITHAL TO FIX IT. AND AND WHICH MAY BE SO I I'M JUST WONDERING TERMS ON THE MAINTENANCE SIDE -- IS THERE ANY HELP WE GIVE THESE HOUSEHOLDS WE FOLLOW UP WITH THEM AND SAY HEY HOW'S YOUR SOLAR STILL WORKING. YOU KNOW. THREE YEARS LATER WE BUILT THIS THING CELL AND IT YES -- I CAN ANSWER THAT -- THE REASON THE SINCE CAN ATTENTION IS GIVEN TO MAINTENANCE A WARRANTY FOR THE WORK THAT WE PERFORM BOTH ON THE ENERGY EFFICIENCY ON THE SELLER'S SIDE. BUT TO YOUR SPECIFIC QUESTION ON SOLAR THERE ARE STRONG WARRANTIES TO A TEN YEAR WARRANTY FOR EXAMPLE SO THERE ARE BEEN. A FEW INSTANCES WHERE CLIENTS HAVE HAD PROBLEMS WITH THE SYSTEMS THAT WERE INSTALLED -- THE CUT ON THE COMPANIES ORGANIZATIONS INVOLVED IN AN INSULATION WILL GO OUT AND TYPICALLY REMEDY -- THOSE THAT THOSE ISSUES SO WE'RE CERTAIN THAT THE THE PERFORMANCE OF THESE SYSTEMS ARE CONTINUING AND THE PROVIDING THE ENERGY EFFICIENCY BENEFITS IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS. AND IN YOUR FOLLOWING UP WITH THE WITH THE CLIENTS TO BE SURE THAT -- SO YOU CAN HAVE A WARRANTY AND SOMETIMES PEOPLE FOLLOW THROUGH THE WARRANTY OR NOT SO I JUST -- SO IT'S GREATER THERE IT'S IT'S ON BE SURE THAT THE SYSTEM SIR THAT SOMEONE'S DOING -- SOME FOLLOW UP TO SHARE THE SYSTEMS ARE STILL UP AND RUNNING AND THAT THEY'RE NOT -- TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE AND CERTAINLY HAVING WARRANTIES ARE IMPORTANT BUT ALSO PEOPLE NEED. TO FOLLOW THROUGH IN. DON'T BE SURE THEY'RE USING THE WARRANTY THAT PEOPLE THAT ARE. NOW HOW DID HOW TO DRAW DOWN AND AT THAT THE COMPANIES ARE FOLLOWING THROUGH ON THAT WHICH OF SURE THEY ARE MONDAY WHEN THEY'RE CALLED. YEAH -- IN IN PART OF THE SERVICE THAT WE PROVIDE IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S GOOD REPRESENTATION OF WHO THE ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE INVOLVED IN THIS ACTIVITY THAT SUPPORT IT. AND IF THERE ARE PROBLEMS WITH PARTNERSHIP OR ANYTHING ELSE THEY KNOW THEY KNOW THE CONTACT THE PRO QUE ALL RIGHT USE THE OTHER CHALLENGED IT -- LOW INCOME FAMILIES FOR FOR MANY GOOD REASONS ARE OFF AND UNFORTUNATELY THEY OFTEN HAVE TO MOVE MORE OFTEN RIGHT -- IS A JOB GET A NEW JOB ETCETERA SO. YOU MAY NOT BE EVEN DEALING WITH THE REGIONAL OWNER ARE NICE OWNER LEASE OR WHATEVER AT THE TIME YOU INSTALL AND YOU KNOW WE TALK ABOUT FARMWORKERS AND SOMETIMES YOU KNOW THAT THEIR BILL IS MOVING AROUND SO. IT MADE THE LITTLE EXTRA ATTENTION TO BE SURE THAT THE PERSON WHO MOVED IN. THINGS THAT WORKING THEY DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE WARRANTY THEY WEREN'T AROUND WHEN THE THING WAS FIRST PUT UP NO ONE TOLD THEM KIND OF THING SO. JUST ONE JUST ONE TO CHECK IN WHAT THE FOLLOW THROUGH IN THE MAIN. EDUCATION WAS SO ALL RIGHT. OKAY ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. OKAY PUBLIC COMMENT.

TO ANY OF THE MAJOR ISSUES THAT -- HE THAT SAID THAT ARE FACING THE DEPARTMENTS OF THANK YOU WELCOME. A MAN START WITH A OVERVIEW THE BUDGET. THANK YOU -- SO IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THE D. SAYS SYSTEM DEPARTMENT IS REQUESTING ONE POINT ZERO EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS -- THAT'S THREE HUNDRED THIRTY NINE MILLION GENERAL FUND AND SEVEN HUNDRED FORTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS OF FEDERAL FUNDING -- THIS IS A SIXTY ONE MILLION DOLLAR INCREASE IN COMPARISON TO THE CURRENT ENACTED BUDGET. PRIMARILY THE INCREASE IS TIED TO A FIFTY SIX MILLION DOLLAR PROPOSAL ON THE WILL DISCUSS LATER ON IN THE AGENDA FOR ISSUE NUMBER. TWO AND OTHER INCREASES ARE TIED TO A FOUR MILLION DOLLAR INCREASE FOR STAFFING COSTS FOR THE DEPARTMENT. TIED TO INCREASE SALARIES AND BENEFITS -- THE BUDGET ALSO INCLUDES SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS PURSUANT TO ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY SIX EIGHTY FOUR FOR THE DEPARTMENT. TO ESTABLISH PARENTAGE OPPORTUNITY PROGRAM -- FOR SAME SEX -- AND ON WHAT OPPOSED TO ESTABLISH PARENTAGE AND OTHER FOLKS THAT MAYBE USING -- REPRODUCTIVE ASSISTANCE METHODS -- THE BUDGET ALSO INCLUDES FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR ESTIMATED INCREASE FEDERAL INCENTIVES AS WELL. ON THE BUDGET ALSO INCLUDES ESTIMATED TWO POINT FIVE FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IN COLLECTIONS FOR THE DEPARTMENT THIS IS A FIFTY EIGHT POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLAR INCREASE IN COMPARISON TO THE CURRENT ENACTED BUDGET -- THE INCREASE IS PRIMARILY DUE -- TO ESTIMATES TIED TO NOT ASSISTANCE COLLECTIONS AND FOR ASSISTANCE QUESTIONS WERE ASSUMING THAT THEY ARE GOING TO REMAIN RELATIVELY FLAT. AT FOUR HUNDRED NINE MILLION DOLLARS. FROM A PROGRAM CHANGES PERSPECTIVE -- WHEN THE PRIMARY ISSUES THAT SPACE AND A CHANCE FOR PROGRAM IS -- IN DECEMBER TWENTIETH OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN FEDERAL CSE PUBLISHED THE FLEXIBILITY EFFICIENCY MODERNIZATION OF THE CHILD SUPPORT PROGRAM -- WHICH THEY REFER TO AS THE FINAL RULE THE FINAL RULE MAKECHANGES TO THE CHILD SUPPORT PROGRAM INTENDED TO INCREASE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PROGRAM FOR ALL FAMILIES. STATES TERRITORIES IN TRAVEL PROGRAMS AND TO ENSURE THAT THE CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES ARE ACCESSIBLE TO FAMILIES AND DELIVERED IN A FAIR AND TRANSPARENT MANNER. SOME OF THESE KEY CHANGES INCLUDE CLARIFYING IN STREAMLINING REGULATIONS TO IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY OF THE CHILD'S OR PROGRAM. CLARIFYING VARIABLES THAT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED OR INCLUDED WHEN CALCULATING CHILD SUPPORT ORDER AMOUNTS IN ORDER TO IMPROVE THE FAIRNESS AND ACCURACY OF CHILD SUPPORT ORDERS IT EXPANDS THE CRITERIA FOR CLOSING CHILD SUPPORT CASES. AND EXPANDS THE TYPES OF SERVICES FOR WHICH THE FEDERAL FINANCIAL PARTICIPATION IS AVAILABLE. DECSS WILL BE EVALUATING THESE PROVISIONS RELATED TO CHARLES PARK EILING CALCULATE -- CALCULATOR IN THE CONTEXT THE CURRENT GUIDELINE QUADRENNIAL REVIEW WHICH IS A FEDERALLY REQUIRED REVIEW THE STATE CHILD SUPPORT ORDER SETTING GUIDELINES DECSS MET WITH THE LOCAL TRANSPORT AGENCIES IN THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL CALIFORNIA THROUGHOUT. TWENTY EIGHTEEN TO REVIEW BOTH THE FINAL RULE PROVISIONS AS WELL AS RELATED TO THE GUIDELINE AS WELLS AS THE CORNEA REVIEW REPORT. SINCE LAST YEAR THE DEPARTMENT HAS IMPLEMENTED MANY PROVISIONS REQUIRED BY THE FEDERAL WRITING. BUT IS STILL WORKING ON IMPLEMENTING A FEW OF THE REMAINING ONES THE DEPARTMENT IS AWAITING FEEDBACK FROM ITS WORK GROUPS ON THOSE IMPLEMENTATION DECISIONS. AND THE PROVISIONS AWAITING A DECISION ARE OPTIONAL AND THEY HAVE AND COMPLAIN ST OF JANUARY -- TWENTY JENNIFER TWENTY TWENTY TWO FRAP -- FOR IMPLEMENTATION. ASIDE FROM THE PATERNITY OPPORTUNITY -- DAY BY THAT REMARK IDENTIFIED THERE ONE ADDITIONAL THING THAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW ASIDE FROM THE GRANTS THAT WE ARE ALREADY RUNNING IS A DIGITAL MARKETING GRANT. AND THAT'S KICKING OFF IN A VERY DIFFERENT COUNTIES -- TO PROVIDE AN INCREASED AWARENESS OF THE CHILD SUPPORT PROGRAM SEE -- HOW THAT IMPACTS THE AM INDIVIDUALS AND CONSTITUENTS IN CALIFORNIA? THANK YOU THANK YOU ALL RIGHT COMES FROM L. L.. ON THE OVERVIEW. NO COMMENTS ON THE OVERVIEW I WILL RESERVE OUR COMMENTS -- REGARDING THE NEW PROPOSED BUDGET METHODOLOGY FOR ISSUE TWO OKAY THANK YOU I FINANCE. NOTHING THAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY QUESTIONS OKAY THANK YOU. PACIFIC REMEMBERS. UP SO JUST IN TERMS OF THE FEDERAL PERFORMANCE MEASURES IN THE NEW FINAL RULE. SO GIVEN THE AND INTO YOUR EVEN MADE SOME CHANGES IS ALSO THAT. A GIVEN WHERE WE ARE NOW TO OF OF EVERYBODY ARE WE GOING TO BE OKAY ARE WE GOING TO FIND OURSELVES AFOUL OF THE NEW STANDARDS I MEAN EVERY BEHIND WE ON TRACK EVERY OKAY. THANK YOU SENATOR WE'RE IN FRONT OF THE CURVE WHEN IT COMES TO THE FINAL RULE MANY OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT ARE IN THE FINAL RULE CALIFORNIA HAS HAD ADOPTED FOR QUITE SOME TIME SO THERE'S SOME FINE TUNING TO BE DONE AROUND. THE GUIDELINE CALCULATION ITSELF AND IDENTIFYING FAIR AND EQUITABLE ORDERS ONE OF THE CHALLENGES FOR RIGHT NOW WE'RE FACING IS -- PART OF OUR GUIDELINE AND IS A PRESUMED INCOME IF WE DON'T KNOW WHAT PEOPLE ARE MAKING WE PRESUME THAT THEY'RE MAKING AT LEAST MINIMUM WAGE FORTY HOURS. AND THAT MIGHT NOT BE THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT OUR CONSTITUENTS ARE FACING IN CALIFORNIA SO THE QUADRENNIAL REVIEW AND UNDERSTANDING EXACTLY WHAT THAT GUY AND I NEED TO BEING IS ONE OF THE BIG QUESTION MARKS THAT THINK WE STILL TO WORK THROUGH -- THROUGHOUT THIS COUNTRY -- REVIEW THAT WERE WERE ENGAGED IN PROFESSOR PERFORMANCE PERCEPT RAM PERSPECTIVE -- COST EFFECTIVENESS CONTINUES TO BE WORK CALIFORNIA STRUGGLES THE MOST WERE ON THE BOTTOM OF THAT -- LIST BUT WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE REST OF THE FEATHER PERFORMANCE MEASURES WERE TOP FIFTEEN AM STATE IN THE NATION SO ON COLLECTIONS AND GRAN COURT ORDERS AND THINGS LIKE THAT WHERE WE'RE HIGH PERFORMING. COMPARED TO THE OTHER STATES SOARING WHAT WE'RE HIGH PERFORMING THEY THINK WE SPEND TOO MUCH ON HIGH PERFORMANCE WELL WE HAVE INVESTED A LOT IN A JOBS. PROGRAM AND YOU KNOW GIVEN THE POPULATION SIZES CALIFORNIA POVERTY RATES AND THINGS LIKE THAT FOR US TO BE ABLE TO PERFORM SO WELL AND THEN ON THE TRANSFER PROGRAM KIND OF SPEAKS TO THAT IN. THAT -- INVESTMENT IN THE PROGRAM OKAY ALL RIGHT A GOOD POINT. EXCELLENT ALL RIGHT -- KATE SNOW THE QUESTIONS SO WE'RE GONNA TAKE PUBLIC COME AT THE END OF THE SECTION -- THIS LET'S MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER TWO LOCAL TRANSPORT AGENCIES A MYSTERY FUNDING AUGMENTATION. SO LAST NAME TO GIVE A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE FUNDING MODEL ITSELF AND THEN MAYBE WE CAN TALK TO THE SPECIFICS THERE. THANK YOU -- DEGENERATE DOES A REALLY GREAT JOB OF OUTLINING THE OVERALL PROPOSAL AND SONS GOING TO KIND OF GO THROUGH IT -- BRIEFLY AND SO STE COMING BACK -- STARTING BACK IN SPRING OF LAST YEAR DURING THE LAST BUDGET CYCLE ON THE DEPARTMENT -- IN CONJUNCTION CSTA HAD TO SUBMIT A PROPOSAL -- TO ESSENTIALLY AUGMENT THE LCS A BUDGET FOR STAFFING SHORTAGES OR STAFFING AND FUNDING SHORTAGES AND THE CURRENT ENACTED BUDGET INCLUDES THREE MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND EIGHT POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLAR TOLL FUNDS. TO HELP SUPPORT NINETEEN OF THE LOWEST FUNDED COUNTIES -- SENSE THAN THE DEPARTMENT AND CSTA HAVE KIND OF GONE BACK AND ESTABLISH WORK GROUPS TO LOOK AT THAT -- PROPOSAL -- SUBMITTED LAST YEAR AND ESSENTIALLY THE PROPOSAL BEFORE YOU IS A PART A PRODUCT OF THAT EFFORT. THE DEPARTMENT CSTA HAD SEVERAL CORE PILLARS THAT WE WANTED TO FOLLOW -- ONE OF WHICH WAS THAT WE WANTED TO EXISTS IMPROVE EXISTING BUDGING PRACTICES ADDRESS ALSO SEE STAFFING -- COST PRESSURES AND FUTURE COST PRESSURES AND BUILD ON THE EFFICIENCIES OF SHARED SERVICES AS WELL AS A CORE UNDERSTANDING OF THE COLLABORATIVE EFFORT WHAT'S THE HOLD HARMLESS DEALS THIS IS A ARE CURRENTLY FUNDED MORE THAN WHAT THE METHODOLOGY WOULD CALCULATE -- FROM THAT THE FUNDAMENTAL CORE METHODOLOGY INCOMES THREE MAJOR COMPONENTS -- ONE BASE LEVEL STAFFING FOR CASE WORK OPERATIONS TO CALL CENTER OPERATIONS AND THREE A PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE COMPONENT. FOR CASE WORK OPERATIONS CSTA IN THE L. -- THE CSA'S AND DECSS SELECTED FIFTEEN LCS ACE TO SAMPLE I'M RANGING FROM VERY LARGE SUCH AS LOS ANGELES TO SMALL -- SUCH AS MARIN TO CONDUCT LEVEL OF EFFORT STUDIES TO DETERMINE WHAT IS THE TASKS AND THE AMOUNT OF EFFORT IT TAKES ON AVERAGE FOR STAFF TO COMPLETE A WIDE ARRAY OF MANDATORY CASE WORK TASKS. THESE TESTS INCLUDING SUCH AS OPENING CASES ESTABLISHING ORDERS AND FORCING ORDERS. REVIEW AND JUST EXISTING ORDERS CASE WORK FINANCIALS ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT. AS A RESULT OF THAT EFFORT -- THE LEVEL OF EFFORT STUDY YIELDED RESULTS THAT ESTIMATED IT WOULD TAKE APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED EIGHTY SEVEN CASES FOUR ONE F. T.. AND BASED ON THAT RATIO -- THERE'S ALSO A TWENTY POINT 9% WE ANY COMPONENT ADDED ON TOP OF THAT FOR COSTS SUCH AS FACILITY LEASES CONTRACTS MAINTENANCE UTILITIES AND OTHER OR ANY NEEDS. THE SECOND COMPONENT THE FOR CALL CENTER OPERATIONS IS BUILT AROUND. THE RATIO OF CAUGHT -- CALLS PER FTE. THE APARTMENT LOOKED AT HOW CURRENT CALL CENTERS ARE OPERATING TODAY AND DECIDED THAT A RATIO SIXTY SIX THOUSAND I'M SORRY. SIX THOUSAND AND THIRTY COST PER FTE -- AS THE METRIC BY WHICH TO MEASURE PERFORMANCE AND FUNDING -- THIS IS KIND OF A MIDDLE GROUND BETWEEN LC ESSAYS ARE CUTTING RUNNING CURRENTLY RUNNING CALL CENTERS EFFICIENTLY AND SOME THAT FALL A LITTLE BIT BELOW THE THRESHOLD. AND WITH THE NEED TO IMPROVE THEIR PERFORMANCE TO MEET -- THE EXPECTATIONS. THE THIRD COMPONENT IS FOR PERFORMANCE INCENTIVES -- THE DEPARTMENT DELTA CAM PERFORMANCES CENTER MODEL THAT LOOKS AT TWO COMPONENTS THE FIRST IS -- TOTAL COLLECTIONS AT FOR NOW CSA AND THE SECOND IS COLLECTION PER CASE. THE REASON FOR PICKING THESE TWO POINTS MATCHES IS OBVIOUSLY THE PRIME EXISTS -- TO EFFECTUALLY COLLECTIONS FOR FAMILIES BUT WE DIDN'T WANT TO SIMPLY LOOK AT TOTAL COLLECTIONS BECAUSE THAT COULD JUST SIMPLY BE TIED TO TOTAL -- INCREASING CASELOADS WHICH IS THE CASE THAT WE WILL ALSO WANTED TO IMPROVE. ON INDIVIDUAL CASES ARE INDIVIDUAL FAMILIES OUTCOMES AS WELL AND SO BY LOOKING ABOVE. THERE'S A FAIR BALANCE BETWEEN THOSE TWO METRICS ON THE OTHER COMPONENT OF THE PERFORMANCES AND OF FINDING IS THAT WE'RE COMPARING ELSE JUST SAY TO THEMSELVES. AND SO CALIFORNIA IS VERY DIVERSE IN ITS DEMOGRAPHICS AND SUCH AND WE DIDN'T WANT TO PENALIZE CERTAIN COUNTIES THAT HAVE LESS AFFLUENT DEMOGRAPHICS WHEN BEING COMPARED TO OTHERS AND SO. WIN A COUNTIES WHEN COMPARED TO THEMSELVES THIS KIND OF ESTABLISH ABOUT FAIRNESS AND THANK YOU. SIDE THIS S. SAY THERE'S THREE MAJOR GOALS OF THIS PROPOSAL ONCE REDUCING POVERTY IN THE TWENTY ONE COUNTIES TO LOCAL TRUST RIGHT AGENCIES WHICH RECEIVED THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING. IT ENABLES FAMILIES IN THESE COUNTIES TO BE MORE SEL SUFFICIENT AND IMPROVES THE FUNDING EQUITY FOR THE STATE'S LOCAL CHILD SUPPORT AGENCIES THAT THE CHILD'S FOR CUSTOMERS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA CAN RECEIVE. CONSISTENT LEVELS OF SERVICE THROUGHOUT THE STATE. SPECIFIC TO POVERTY TWENTY ONE IN THE TWENTY ONE COUNTIES ARE IMPACTED HERE RECEIVE ADDITIONAL FUNDING HAVE SOME OF THE HIGHEST RATES OF POVERTY INSIDE STATE. PARTY RATES AMONGST THE TWENTY ONE COUNTIES IS AVERAGING FIFTEEN POINT 1% AMONGST THEM. AND WHILE THE RATES AS HIGH AS SPECIFIC TAKE THE CASE LOADS AND HE'S TWENTY ONE COUNTY 78% OF THE CASES ARE CURRENTLY FORMER OR NEVER EIGHTY OR CURRENT OR FORMALLY EIGHT IN. WITH REGARD TO SELF SUFFICIENCY IS CHALLENGING FOR FAMILIES IN OUR CASE LIVE IN THESE COUNTIES TO BE SELF SUFFICIENT CURRENTLY THE AVERAGE COLLECTIONS PER CASE FOR THE TWENTY ONE COUNTIES AS A THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY THREE DOLLARS PER YEAR. THAT'S COMPARED BY THE AVERAGE OF THE 200-040-0401 PER YEAR OF THE OTHER THIRTY LOCAL TRANSFER AGENCIES. ACCORDING TO THE STUDY CONDUCT BY THE URBAN INSTITUTE THE CHILD SUPPORT PAYMENTS CAN ACCOUNT FOR UP 240%. OF A LOW INCOME RECIPIENTS HOUSEHOLD INCOME. WITH REGARD TO FIT FUNDING EQUITY THE LA -- REPORTEDLY CORRECTLY REPORTS THERE'S A GREAT DISPARITY IN THE FUNDING ACROSS LOCAL CHANNELS FOR AGENCIES THE AVERAGE FUNDING FOR CASE FOR THE TWENTY ONE COUNTIES IS FIVE HUNDRED ONE DOLLARS PER CASE. COMPARED TO THE AVERAGE OF EIGHT HUNDRED AND NINETY FOUR PER CASE FOR THE OTHER THIRTY COUNTIES STOPPING FUNDING EQUITY IS CRITICAL TO ENSURE THAT THE CHILD SUPPORT PROGRAM IS ABLE TO PROVIDE. A CONSISTENT LEVEL OF SERVICE STATEWIDE FOR CHILD SUPPORT CUSTOMERS DESPITE GEOGRAPHIC AND SOCIOECONOMIC DIFFERENCES ACROSS THE STATE. SO WE ATTEMPTED TO TACKLE A LOT OF THESE -- INSIDE THE PROPOSAL THE DAN FIGHT ISSUES ONCE WITHOUT POVERTY AND AND SELF SUFFICIENCY AND THE OTHER WITH EQUITY AND AND I I REALLY WANT EMPHASIZE WHY I'M CONCERNED THAT WE SHOULDN'T AND CAN'T WAIT -- TO MOVE FORWARD ON THIS PROPOSAL. THERE WERE TWENTY ONE COUNTIES LAW FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY FOUR POSITIONS OF THE LAST SIX YEARS AND IF YOU GO BACK EVEN FURTHER THAT'S AN EVEN MORE DRASTIC NUMBER. STAFFING REDUCTIONS OF 12% AS NOTED ABOVE THIS IS RESULTED IN LOWER PROGRAM PERFORMANCE MEASURES DELIVERY OF SERVICING COLLECTIONS CUSTOMERS THE COST OF WAITING IS THAT THE ECONOMICALLY CHALLENGED FAMILIES IN THESE COUNTIES. WILL CONTINUE TO BE UNDERSERVED COMPARATIVE FAMILIES SERVE BY ADEQUATELY FUNDED LCS ACE. EFFICIENCY IS A BIT OF A KEY DISCUSSION IS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THE MOST SICK SIGNIFICANT EFFICIENCY WITH WE HAVE IDENTIFIED IS THAT OF THE CALL CENTERS WHICH WE SPECIFICALLY CALLED OUT IN A PROPOSAL. VIC SUCCESSFUL ENCOURAGE CELSIUS IS TO CONSOLIDATE THEIR CALL CENTERS TO REDUCE THE COST OF RUNNING INDEPENDENT CALL CENTERS AN AERIAL CEASING TO PROPOSAL MAKES CALL CENTERS EVEN MORE EFFICIENT BY ESTABLISHING A SET RATIO. FOR CALLS PRIDGEN BASED ON THOSE CALLS AND DRIVING AND DRIVING ESTIMATES SEVEN MILLION OF FEATURES FOR THEIR SAVINGS COMPARED THE ACTUAL COSTS. THE BULLS ARE RE DIRECTS THESE RESOURCES AN OFFSET THE OVERALL COST OF THE MUZZLE IN A CALL CENTER THAT FALLS BELOW THOSE BEST PRACTICE METRICS WE NEED TO REDUCE STAFFING AND STREAMLINE OPERATIONS OR FALL IN LINE WITH THE RATIO. I CAN REPORT THAT TO DATE OUTSIDE THE CALL CENTER PROPOSAL WE HAVE NOT IDENTIFIED ANY FOR POLLS OR OR EFFICIENCIES THAT WOULD HAVE SAVED WOULD SAVE SIGNIFICANT COSTS. IN THE MAGNITUDE OF THE TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT THIS RIPPLES IS TALKING ABOUT. WHEN IT COMES TO THE CASE WORKERS IN THE CASE RATIOS ARE PROPOSAL? THE RACES THAT WE PROPOSE OR WHAT WE BELIEVE IS NECESSARY FOR CASE WORKERS TO REACH OUT PROACTIVELY. TO CUSTOMERS AND WORK WITH HIM CLARITY TO ACHIEVE POSITIVE OUTCOMES IN THE CASES AND OBTAIN FUNDING THIS SIR. SO IN ADDITION THAT WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE FINAL RULE AND EVERYTHING IN THE FINAL RULE IS TALKING ABOUT GETTING AWAY FROM TECHNOLOGY IN INCREASING OUR INVOLVEMENT ON A ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS WITH OUR CONSTITUENTS. SINCE OUR IN THE BUDGET METHODOLOGY IDENTIFIES AN APPROPRIATE LEVEL RESOURCES AND STANDARD OF SERVICE FOR THE FAMILIES. COUNTY IS CURRENTLY FUNDED ABOVE THE TWENTY ONE AND FINING COUNTIES YIELD HIGHER PERFORMANCE BRING IN THE LOWER TWENTY ONE FUNNY COUNTIES TO PARITY IS EXPECTED TO YIELD SIMILAR RESULTS. REALLOCATING FUNDING FROM THE OTHER COUNTIES COULD LEAD TO STAFFING RATIOS -- REDUCTIONS IN THOSE COUNTIES WHICH WE THINK WILL NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR OVERALL COLLECTIONS ACROSS THE STATE. DEPARTMENT'S PROPOSAL SEEKS TO CREATE EQUITY AMONGST ALL THE COUNTIES WELL RESPECTED THE FLEXIBILITY OF THE LOCALLY OPERATED PROGRAMS TO RUN THE PROGRAMS THANK YOU. THANK QUESTIONS -- ALEJO. AS A THE DEPARTMENT MENTIONED THERE HAS BEEN A LONG STANDING ISSUE WITH FUNDING WHEN IT COMES TO LOCAL CHILD SUPPORT AGENCIES IN THIS ISSUE DID COME UP LAST YEAR AND THE LEGISLATURE SHARED A SIMILAR CONCERN. THAT THE CURRENT FUNDING METHODOLOGY ISN'T NECESSARILY BASED ON ANY POLICY RATIONALE OR ANY STATE OBJECTIVE -- DOES FOLLOWING THOSE CONVERSATIONS THE LEGISLATURE DID PROVIDE AN AUGMENTATION TO FUNDING OF THREE MILLION GENERAL FUND BUT ALSO REQUIRED THE ADMINISTRATION. IN COLLABORATION WITH LOCAL CHILD SUPPORT AGENCIES TO TAKE OF RE LOOK AT THE PROGRAM REALLY INVESTIGATE SERVICE DELIVERY PROGRAM STRUCTURE AND IDENTIFY ANY POSSIBLE OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES. BE IT -- COST OF FOR COST EFFECTIVENESS OR JUST OVERALL -- EFFICIENCIES OF PROGRAM SERVICE DELIVERY -- THAT SPECIFIC REPORT ISN'T DUE UNTIL JULY FIRST TWENTY NINETEEN OF THIS YEAR -- WITH REGARDS TO THE PROPOSED NEW BUDGETING METHODOLOGY OUR OFFICE DID -- CONDUCT AN ANALYSIS AND ULTIMATELY WE FOUND THAT IT IS PREMATURE AND RAISES A NUMBER OF POLICY QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS. THE PRE MATURITY OF THE PROPOSAL IS TWO PRONGED AS THE DEPARTMENT MENTIONED -- WITHIN THE PAST FEW YEARS WE DID RECEIVE FEDERAL GUIDANCE BUT REALLY TASKS STATES TOTE RELOOK AT TELL THEIR PROGRAMS OPERATE -- FOR THE PURPOSES OF ABILITY TO PAY HAVING ORDERS -- REFLECT ABILITY TO PAY BUT ALSO THESE BROADER POLICY CONVERSATIONS AROUND -- PRESUMED AND COME ARE HOW WE ESTABLISH ORDERS -- ARE ARE PREMATURE AT THE END TO THE EXTENT -- DEPENDING ON HOW WE APPROACH THOSE -- GUIDANCE THAT COULD AFFECT NOT ONLY SERVICE DELIVERY BUT ALSO WORKLOAD IN ACROSS LOCAL CHILD SUPPORT AGENCIES -- BUT THE MAIN GUY -- POINT OF FREE MATURITY REALLY HAS TO DO WITH THIS MORE IMMEDIATE LEGISLATIVE DIRECTED TO REALLY LOOK AT OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES AND THE REASON WHY THAT MATTERS IS -- WERE FOR WHATEVER OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES ARE IDENTIFIED SOME OF WHICH I AM WE IDENTIFIED SOME IN OUR REPORT. THAT COULD HAVE IMPLICATIONS NOT ONLY ON HOW SERVICES ARE DELIVERED BUT ALSO THE ASSOCIATED WORKLOAD ACROSS LOCAL CHILD SUPPORT AGENCIES WE COULD SEE AN INCREASE IN WORKLOAD RELATIVE TODAY OR DECREASE AND WORKLOAD -- BUT UNTIL THAT WORK% HAS BEEN DONE ND WE GET A BETTER SENSE OF THE NET IMPACT BUT IT WOULD HAVE ON THE PROGRAM -- IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT TO THEN PROPOSE A NEW BUDGETING METHODOLOGY AND ATTACHED WITH THE LEGISLATIVE REPORTING REQUIREMENT WAS. ONCE WE IDENTIFY THE OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES WAS TO THEN IDENTIFY BUDGET REFINEMENTS THAT WOULD BE NEEDED TO ADDRESS THE NET IMPACT THOSE WOULD HOP ON THE PROGRAM AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT. IS MISSING FROM THE PROPOSAL -- THE OTHER POINT SETTING THAT ASIDE THE PRE MATURITY THE PROPOSAL WE DID IDENTIFY NUMBER OF POLICY QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS SOME OF THEM RELATED -- TO THE ASSUMPTION THAT FUNDING WOULD RESULT IN IMPROVED PERFORMANCE -- NOT ADDRESSING THE NURSES THE TRADE OFFS -- ASSOCIATED WITH LOOKING AT FINDING AMONGST THOSE ELSE -- LOCAL TRANSPORT AGENCIES THAT WERE IDENTIFIED AS HAVING MORE FUNDING THAN IS NEEDED TO OPERATE THE PROGRAM AND EVALUATING -- WHAT A REALLOCATION WOULD LOOK LIKE IN THE TRADEOFFS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT BUT ALSO OTHER MORE TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF THE PROPOSAL WHICH WERE HAPPY TO GO INTO IN MORE DETAIL IF NEEDED -- BUT BECAUSE OF THE PRE MATURITY IN THESE POLICY QUESTIONS OUR RECOMMENDATION WAS TO WITHHOLD ACTION UNTIL MORE WORK IS DONE -- SPECIFICALLY ON ADDRESSING THE LEGISLATIVE DIRECTIVE OF OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES AND THEN DETERMINING HOW DOES THAT AFFECT FUNDING LEVELS. NOT ONLY THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF FUNDING THAT'S NEEDED BUT ALSO THE ALLOCATION OF ABOUT FUNDING ACROSS ALL CSAA'S -- THE BUDGET PROPOSALS MAINLY BASED OFF OF CURRENT PRACTICES BUT IN LIGHT OF OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES ARE EVER WE DID DECIDE TO APPROACH THE FEDERAL GUIDANCE. ON THAT COULD CHANGE THE OPERATION OF THE PROGRAM BUT THEN ALSO WHICH LC ESSAYS ARE IDENTIFIED AS REQUIRING MORE RESOURCES -- HOWEVER AGAIN WE DID ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE CURRENT FUNDING STRUCTURE IS OF CONCERN SEN ARE -- REPORT WE DID MENTION SUMMER TO LAST YEAR HOW THE LEGISLATURE WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THIS YOU COULD TAKE A SIMILAR APPROACH OF PROVIDING STOP GAP FUNDING IN THE INTERIM. UNTIL THESE BROADER POLICY QUESTIONS ARE DRESSED -- ONE OPTION THAT WE PRESENTED IN THE REPORT WAS JUST A A REGULAR INFLATION ADJUSTMENT TO THE STATE FUNDING THAT'S PROVIDED TO ALL ALL CSA'S -- BUT THERE ARE ALSO OTHER OPTIONS AS WELL I'M SO HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU -- FINANCE -- YES I'D LIKE TO NOTE THAT THIS PROPOSALS PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S EARLY CHILDHOOD BUDGET PACKAGE WHICH IS ONE OF HIS PRIORITIES AND SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSES. EASING FINANCIAL PRESSURES ON PARENTS SO THAT THEY CAN ESCAPE THE CYCLE OF POVERTY AND FOCUS ON THE HEALTHY DEVELOPMENT OF THEIR CHILDREN. AND WE VIEW THIS AS AN INVESTMENT TO CREATE A MORE EQUITABLE FUNDING DISTRIBUTION ACROSS ALL COUNTIES AND REDUCE GEOGRAPHIC AND DEMOGRAPHIC DISPARITIES IN FUNDING. AND AFTER FULL IMPLEMENTATION INCREASE COLLECTIONS RESULTING FROM THIS INVESTMENT WILL DIRECTLY BENEFIT FAMILIES. PARTICULARLY LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS A TEND TO BE CONCENTRATED IN THE TWENTY ONE LC ESSAYS THAT WILL RECEIVE. THE FUNDING AUGMENTATION -- ACTUALLY [inaudible] SENSING. IS THERE A REPRESENTED THE CHILD SUPPORT DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION HERE -- TWELVE DAYS -- TAKE. ONE WILL BE A SPOKESPERSON -- DIVIDE COMING UP TO THE TABLE. I THINK YOU SHOULD BE PART OF THE DISCUSSION. BUT WE HAVE A QUESTION PERIOD. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT. THE SUN ORDERS THE OFFER THE REQUESTED. OKAY THANK THANK YOU FOR BEING UP HERE -- IN. THE RIGHTS TWENTY ASK ONE QUESTION BEFORE KNOW ALL OF THAT AND THEN AT AND SO -- IN THE JUST CLARIFIED IN THE PROPOSAL BEING PRESENTED BY THE ADMINISTRATION -- CAN YOU JUST MAYBE SPEAK TO THE HOW INVOLVED THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS WERE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THESE NEW STANDARDS ARE FOR THIS PROPOSAL. SO IT'S READ MEAN EMMA. YES AND ACTUALLY FUTURE USES OF FOR THE RECORD SEVEN FIRST NAME IS PHYLLIS NANCE I AM THE DIRECTOR. OF ALAMEDA COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES AND THE PRESIDENT OF THE CHILD SUPPORT DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION -- DISSOCIATION WORKED -- COOPERATIVELY WITH THE DEPARTMENT IN TERMS OF CREATING A WORK GROUP OF COUNTIES. OF DIVERSITY OF COUNTIES AND ACTUALLY WORKED ON THIS PROPOSAL. WE PATTERN ARE A STUDY IN OUR EFFORT -- WITH OTHER SOCIAL SERVICES STUDIES AND WE WORKED TO DETERMINE. THE FUNDING LEVELS. FOR THE PROGRAM OKAY SO THIS THIS PROPOSAL AS A RESULT OF ACTUALLY DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN BOTH THE COUNTY AND ADMINISTRATION AND AND JUST ONE OTHER QUESTION FOR ADMINISTRATION -- WHAT'S THE STATUS THE REPORT WE SHOULD ANTICIPATE THE REPORT THAT I WAS REFERRED TO BY THAT THE THAT THE DEADLINE SOMEWHERE THAT REPORT WE HAVE ALSO BEEN WORKING HAND IN HAND WITH A CHANCE FOR TRACTORS SO STATION IDENTIFY THOSE EFFICIENCIES INTO PLAN HAVE THAT REPORT AND BY JULY FIRST. OKAY I THANK YOU ALL RIGHT. SEARCH ENGINE ANY QUESTION TWENTY SURE WE GOT THIS FAX THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I'M I'M SORRY -- I WAS LATE I HAD A COUPLE OF EMERGENCIES OF AND TAKE CARE OF SO I'M I'M SORRY I IF I A MISSED SOME IMPORTANT PARTS OF THE PRESENTATION -- BUT EVERY MYSTIFIED INSURER -- SOME MY CONCERNS AND APPRECIATE THE THE GOVERNOR'S GOALS I THINK -- LAUDABLE -- BUT THE THE IS THIS A CASE WHERE THE STATE IS JUST YOU KNOW THROWING MORE MONEY AT A PROBLEM THAT IS -- NOT -- CLEARLY -- IDENTIFIED AS TO HOW WE'RE GOING TO RETURN OUR GOALS -- CALIFORNIA RANKS LAST IN THE NATION IN COST EFFECTIVENESS AS FAR AS ADMINISTRATIVE CHILD SUPPORT PROGRAM. SO I THINK BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE SPENDS ANOTHER SIXTY MILLION BUCKS ON THE PROGRAM I THINK WE SHOULD LOOK AT ALL WAYS TO STREAMLINE. AND HEAVY FISSION OPERATIONAL EXPENSES SO. FOR THE DEPARTMENT -- WHAT IDEAS HAVE YOU SHARED IF YOU HAVE ALREADY OR DO YOU HAVE? THAT WILL STREAMLINE OPERATIONAL DEFICIENCIES AND IMPROVE THE pPROGRAM. AND CAN THE DEPARTMENT TELL US WHAT KIND OF RECOMMENDATIONS WE MIGHT SEE IN THE CHART REPORT -- I DID TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE EFFICIENCIES THAT ARE THAT ARE IN THE WORKS OF THE THE PRIMARY FISSIONS IF THEY WERE ABLE TO FIND AT THE LOCAL CHANNELS FOR AGENCIES AS WITH THE RATE WITH REGARD TO THE CALL CENTERS AND HOW WE ORGANIZE THOSE WE'VE STARTED CONSOLIDATE. THOSE DOWN -- TO PRESERVATION SEES AT THE LOCAL LEVEL IT'S REALLY CASE MANAGEMENT AND SO IT'S ABOT THE RATIO AND DYNAMIC OF THE NUMBER OF CASE WORKERS TO THE CASES -- EFFICIENCIES IN THE OVERALL PROGRAM ARE GOING TO HAPPEN IN STATE POLICY AND WITH OUR CHILD SUPPORT ENFORCEMENT SYSTEM ON A STATEWIDE BASIS AND THAT'S RUN UP AT THE STATE -- BUT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND AND I'VE HAD MY EXPERIENCE AND AS THE DIRECTOR OF RIVERSIDE COUNTY IN UNDERSTANDING KIND THAT CHALLENGE OF OF CASE WORKERS WHEN YOU GOT. FAR MORE CASES THAT YOU CAN GET. TO HOME WE WERE LEFT WITH THE IT WITH THE NEED TO SHIP CASES TO OTHER PLACES BECAUSE WE JUST COULDN'T HANDLE -- TOUCHING THOSE CASES AND THOSE OF THE COUNTIES WERE ABLE TO BRING THEM SIGNIFICANT INCREASE COLLECTIONS I CASES WE JUST COULDN'T GET TO YOU. SO WHEN IT GETS DOWN TO THE LINE LEVEL IT'S REALLY ABOUT THE NUMBER OF BODIES WE HAVE WORKING WITH THESE CONSTITUENTS TO HELP THEM GET BACK UP ON THEIR FATE FEE AND DELIVER THE COLLECTIONS. SO WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT EFFICIENCY THE LOCAL WE HAVE NOT IDENTIFIED ANY OTHER MAJOR EFFICIENCIES THAT ARE GONNA MAKE UP DEFICIT LIKE THIS. AND THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT IN THIS PROPOSAL SO WOULD YOU -- OPINED THAT THE CASE LOADS FOR OUR OUR WONDERFUL CHAMPIONS IN THE COUNTIES THAT ARE TRYING. TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIVES HERE -- WOULD YOU SAY THE CASELOADS IN IN CALIFORNIA ARE MUCH HIGHER FOR EACH -- EMPLOYEE THIS HELPING CAN IN COMPARISON TO OTHER STATES OF OUR OF OUR SIZE TAXES -- NEW YORK. I WOULDN'T SAY THE CASE THOSE ARE NECESSARY HIGHER OR LOWER IT DEPENDS ON THE STAGE TALKING HAVE -- SOME COUNTIES THAT ARE -- HIGHER AND COST EFFICIENCIES ARE STATE RUN AND NOT LOCALLY OPERATED AND THE VALUE OF HAVING A LOCALLY OPERATED PROGRAM HERE IN CALIFORNIA IS THE TWO POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN THE HAND IN HAND -- CONNECTION THAT WE HAVE IN IN THE CHALLENGES WE ENGAGE IN AND TRYING -- TO TAILOR OUR SERVICES TO THE CONSTITUENTS ABOUT RESPECTIVE COUNTY -- SO THAT THAT'S A DIFFERENT A FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE IN THE PROGRAM ANOTHER FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE IN OUR STATE COMPARED TO OTHER STATES IS THAT JUDICIAL VERSES ADMINISTRATIVE APPROACH -- A WE HAVE A JUDICIAL BASE SYSTEM HERE AND THEN INCREASES SOME OF THE COSTS THAT GO ALONG WITH THE PROGRAM. BUT THOSE ARE FUNDAMENTAL CALIFORNIA LIKE LEGISLATIVE KINDS OF DISCUSSIONS AND NOT EFFICIENCIES THAT WE CAN ADDRESS AT THE LCS A LEVEL. AND THAT MAYBE YOU ARE THE LA -- AND ADDRESS THOSE JUDICIAL VERSES ADMINISTRATIVE -- PATHWAYS IN ADMINISTERING THE PROGRAM THE THE BENEFITS OF ONE OVER THE OTHER ARE WE USING THE WRONG THE WRONG METHOD METHODOLOGY HERE. BECAUSE IT WAS HE LIKE AND I I THINK I SHARE THE LA OWES CONCERNED CITIZENS DID DOESN'T SEEM TO BE A A CLEAR MARCHING PLAN FORWARD TO ACCOMPLISH OUR GOALS MAY BE CAN COMMENT ON THAT. I THINK THE QUESTION YOU'RE RAISING IN TERMS OF SHOULD THE STATE INCREASE THE USE OF ADMINISTRATIVE PRACTICES TO ESTABLISH OUR OPERATE THE PROGRAM THAT'S ONE OF THE TYPE OF OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES THAT WE SUGGESTED THE LEGISLATURE. FLAK FOR THE ADMINISTRATION TO LOOK INTO -- FOR THEIR JULY FIRST REPORT -- IT DEFINITELY. IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE ARE CURRENT ADMINISTRATIVE PRACTICES THAT ARE HAPPENING ONE WAY IS -- A LOT OF L. C. ESSAYS ARE DOING UP FRONT WORK TO TRY -- TO ESTABLISH A PRE COURT AGREEMENT AMONGST CUSTODIAL NONCUSTODIAL PARENTS IN THOSE ARE CALLED STIPULATED ORDERS -- THAT REDUCES THEN THE NEED OF CUSTODIAL NONCUSTODIAL PARENTS POTENTIALLY TO THEN BE INVOLVED IN THE JUDICIAL PROCESS -- AND IT COULD -- THEN POSSIBLY REDUCE THE NEED OF STAFF BEING INVOLVED IN THAT PROCESS THAT OPERATES DIFFERENTLY BECAUSE AGAIN IT IT IS A RELATIONSHIP WITH LOCAL COURTS -- BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT THAT COULD BE EXPANDED -- IT COULD BE EMPHASIZED IT IT DOES REQUIRE SOME FORM OF STATE LEADERSHIP BUT THAT'S A TYPE OF OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY THAT WE IDENTIFIED IN OUR REPORT. THAT -- IT'S A NEW WAY OR A NEW WAY OF DOING THINGS POSSIBLY STATEWIDE AND FOR AND MAYBE IN SOME LC ESSAYS -- BUT THEN UNDERSTANDING THAT NET COST OVER THE NET CHANGING CURRENT OPERATIONS -- SOMETHING THAT HOPEFULLY THAT JULY FIRST REPORT THAT TYPE OF LEVEL OF OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES IS SOMETHING THAT THE LEGISLATURE MAY. FLAG AS SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE LOOKED INTO PROCEDURES SPONSORED I LOOK FOR TO GET IN THE JULY -- REPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU -- SO A FEW QUESTIONS AND SO FIRST OF ALL I I MEAN I I I SIT HERE AND I AND I IS THAT WELL BY MEMBER LAST YEAR. I TOLD DEPARTMENT. THEY SOLD THE DIRECTORS GET TOGETHER AND FIGURE THIS OUT BECAUSE WE HAD A TOTALLY DYSFUNCTIONAL WAY OF DISTRIBUTING THE FUNDS WE HAD. COUNTIES RICHMOND CENTER FUND SURE THERE'S SOME COUNTIES DON'T SAY THEY'RE OVER FUNDED BUT I GET A BIT MORE. AND THEY SAID WE WE NEED TO FIGURE THIS OUT -- AND IT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR WAY TOO LONG. SO AND I ACTUALLY FIRST OF ALL I HAVE TO SAY THANK YOU FOR ACTUALLY DOING WHAT. I WHAT I ASKED -- WHICH IS GET TOGETHER FIGURE THIS OUT AND LET'S TRY TO COME UP WITH A MORE EQUITABLE WAY OF DOING THINGS NOW IS THE PERFECT. AND ART OF PERHAPS MORE INFORMATION WE NEED TO GET -- NOW I'M SURE IS CA MORE DATA THEY'LL HELP REFINE FUTURE BUT I I EIGHT AND AND AND I THINK THE ONLY A RAISES SOME SOME GOOD QUESTIONS -- BUT BUT I DO HAVE TO SAY IS THAT WHAT WILL -- I DON'T WANT TO DO IS LEAVE THE OLD SYSTEM IN PLACE. ALL RIGHT THAT'S BEEN AROUND HOW HOW MANY YEARS NOW AND A GATES TWO DECADES RIGHT WHICH REALLY I MEAN. SO SO AT REALIZE THERE MAY BE SOME STILL SOME QUESTIONS HE FIGURED OUT -- BUT AND FRANKLY I WONDERED TO WHAT DEGREE IS OUR QUOTE INEFFICIENCY RELATE TO THE FACT THAT WE HAVE APPROXIMATELY -- WHAT PORTION OF OUR STATE BECAUSE THE IF YOU HAD ALL THE PEOPLE IN THAT IS COUNTY HIS ALTOGETHER? YEAH THAT 70% OF OUR CASELOAD RESIDES IN THESE TWENTY ONE CALIBRATE THE SO SO SO BASICALLY WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT WE HAVE. BECAUSE WE DO IT AND THERE'S DIFFERENT REASONS WHY WE HAVE COUNT YET WE HAVE WITH MR THROUGH THE COUNTIES BUT BASICALLY HAVE A GOOD CHUNK OF THE STATE. THAT IS UNDER FUNDED AND THEREFORE NOT ABLE TO ACHIEVE CERTAIN LEVELS EFFICIENCY OR SCALE -- AND AND SO MAYBE THAT THEY'LL IT WE WE THINK ABOUT LIKE WHAT'S THE RETURN ON THE INVESTMENT -- THAT -- THAT WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ACTUALLY IMPROVE EFFICIENCY SIMPLY BY. GETTING. EVERYONE -- NOT JUST PART OF THE STATE BUT THE ENTIRE STATE UP TO A TO TO TO A POINT WHERE WE CAN ACTUALLY -- MORE EFFICIENTLY GET THE WORK DONE. I'M SURE THERE ARE PROCESSES WE CAN IMPROVE AS WELL -- AND IN A KNOW YOU'VE TALKED AND THAT'S WHY I WANT YOU UP HERE BECAUSE I THINK THIS REALLY IS A COLLABORATION AND WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT HOW THIS COMES TOGETHER. SO AND WE DO THERE IS A REPORT THAT SHOULD BE COMING OUT AND AND I GUESS IT'S NOW APRIL RIGHT SO MAY JUNE. COUPLE COUPLE MONTHS -- AND NICE THAT AND I SENATOR AGENCIES PRODUCING THE REPORT. OKAY SO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE PRODUCING REPORT AND HAVE THAT HAVE THAT THEY'VE BEEN WALLED OFF FROM THE REST OF THE DEPARTMENT OR THEY'VE SORT OF FED BACK INFORMATION TO OTHER PEOPLE IN THE DEPARTMENT AND THE ONGOING DISCUSSIONS AND DEVELOPMENT. PROPOSAL WE'VE BEEN MOVING THAT THAT CONVERSATION ACROSS BOTH THE DEPARTMENT AS WELL AS WITH THE LOCAL TOWN OKAY AGENCIES AND WRITE A DIFFERENT VENUES OKAY SO THEN THE THE THE THE INVESTIGATION THAT THERE. THE DATA COLLECTING AND PUTTING TOGETHER AND ANALYZING TO HELP FINALLY PRODUCE THAT REPORT. WAS ALSO MEANS NOT COMPLETE WE DON'T KNOW THEY MAY HAVE SOME MORE STUFF THEY DISCOVER THE NEXT COUPLE MONTHS BUT WAS ALSO PART OF THE PROCESS AND HELPING DEVELOP THIS PROPOSAL. IS THAT CORRECT. OKAY ALL RIGHT -- SO I MEAN IT'S THAT. SO I MADE A THINK. YOU KNOW I I AND I THINK THAT WE NEED TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS THAT. THAT YOU RAISING AT THE LA OWES RAISING I THINK THERE'S ADJUSTMENTS WE NEED MAY EFFECTIVELY MOVED TO YELL OKAY WE WANT THIS TO A MORE ADMINISTRATIVE. I'M NOT SURE HOW. SOME OF THOSE DECISIONS -- EFFORTS THAT GO DOWN THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS HAVE HAPPENED IN THE PAST AND THEY HAVE NOT GONE RIGHT SO IT MAY BE REFRESHING LOOK AT THOSE MIGHT AN OPTION BUT YEAH WELL I I GUESS WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THAT I DON'T SEE YOUR PROPOSALS. PREVENTING THAT FROM US FROM DOING THAT THE FUTURE IF THAT TURNS OUT THAT'S WHERE WE WANT TO GO AND OBVIOUSLY. THERE'S OTHER DISCUSSIONS THAT NEED TO HAPPEN SO SO I GUESS PART OF ME. IS SAYING THAT I APPRECIATE THE SUGGESTION WHAT WE CAN DO IS WE CAN JUST DO ANOTHER AUGMENTATION ADDED INSULATION ADJUSTER BUT NOT ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT SOMETHING AT THIS POINT -- BUT WHAT I SEE HERE IS IS THAT. THINGS WERE SO BAD FOR TWO DECADES. I I DON'T SEE HOW AND AND AND I AND A GOOD TO GET THE IDEA THAT OKAY WHAT HAPPENS NOW WE HAVE A PROPOSAL THAT WERE OUT THERE. COUNTY AGENCIES WILL BE MAKING CERTAIN DECISIONS BASED ON THE MAKING CERTAIN HIRING DECISIONS CELLS ARE CERTAIN STAFFING DECISIONS BUT BUT I ALSO THINK THE PROPOSAL'S. SEEM LIKE A AGAIN I HAVEN'T I'LL WAIT TO SEE WHAT THE REPORT IS NOW I THINK OUR FORM THAT I THINK WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MAKING ADJUSTMENTS TO THAT AND NOT THAT -- THE REPORT'S GONNA COME OUT AND WHOLESALE WOW THIS WHOLE PROPOSAL. DOESN'T WORK AND WE HAVE TO REBUILD THIS THING FROM SCRATCH AGAIN. IS -- SO I I JUST. THEN I'D THAT'S WHY LAST YEAR SAID GET TOGETHER AND FIGURE THIS OUT AND ACTUALLY APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT GOT TOGETHER YOU FIGURED OUT YOU HERE BEFORE ME SAYING THIS IS WHAT WE FIGURED OUT TOGETHER. RIGHT AND WE HAD THAT YOU KNOW HOW THE CONVERSATION AND AND INSTEAD OF SAYING WHAT WE GOT AWAY FROM CELLS ARE YOU. KELLY FOR THE REPORT BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING I I LIKE THE FACT THAT WE'RE MOVING FOR THAT WERE MOVING FORWARD AND THAT THEY THESE CONVERSATIONS HAVE THAT HAPPEN -- BECAUSE IT AT LEAST I DON'T SEE THIS PROPOSAL IS LET'S SAY. I THINK THE PAST SYSTEM IS MUCH WORSE THAN WHAT'S BEING PROPOSED HERE EVEN IF WE HAVE TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS LATER ON THAT MAKES SENSE. SO SO -- BUT I DO WANT I THINK YOU KNOW WE DO ONE WE SEE THE REPORT AND I THINK THE ISSUES THE LA -- IS RAISING AND WE WILL WHAT WANT TO FOLLOW THROUGH AND MAKE THOSE ADJUSTMENTS AND HAVE THAT ON GOING CONVERSATION IT RIGHT NOW SO BUT IT YOU KNOW WHATEVER HAPPENS IN THE FINAL BUDGET -- BUT I THAT -- HOPEFULLY -- THAT'S NOT THE END OF THE STORY THAT'S NOT THE END OF THE CONVERSATION -- BUT I I DO WANT TO JUST -- EXPRESS MY APPRECIATION FOR THE FACT THAT WE RECOGNIZE THE PROBLEM LAST YEAR. THERE'S A COMMITMENT BY BOTH THE ADMINISTRATION AT TO MAKE YOUR PROCESS OF WAS A LITTLE ROCK LE RELUCTANCE. BUT AND THE AND THE DIRECTORS AND SAID COME TOGETHER FIGURE THIS OUT LET'S STOP LET'S FIX THIS PROBLEM -- DISTANCE FUNCTIONAL PROBLEM. AND YOU'RE BOTH HERE TOGETHER SAYING WE WE HAVE WE HAVE US WE HAVE A SOLUTION AND YOU KNOW WE NEED TO EVALUATE IT WE NEED TO BE SURE IT WORKS NOW WE CAN WE GET DEFICIENCIES RIGHT. ETCETERA -- BUT CERTAINLY WHAT WE KNOW WHAT WE HAD FOR WASN'T WORKING [inaudible] RIGHT YES. WHO AM I DO WANT TO SAY THAT IN OUR LEVEL OF EFFORT STUDY WE TOOK A CROSS SECTION? OF LOCAL CHILD SUPPORT AGENCIES NOT ONLY IN TERMS OF THEIR DEMOGRAPHICS ANDTHEIR SIZE BUT ALSO THEIR PERFORMANCE. AND IN THAT EFFORT STUDY WE INCLUDED THOSE CONVERSATIONS pCOUNTIES AND MAYBE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT THEY WERE DOING SO THAT WE COULD -- REALIZE A CASELOAD -- TO F. T. E. RATIO SO PART OF OUR OUR WORK THAT WE DID WAS TO BE. COGNIZANT OF THE FACT THAT WE REALLY WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WEREN'T JUST LOOKING AT THINGS AS THEY ARE -- IN LOOKING AT STRICTLY BY THE NUMBERS BUT I'M TRYING TO INCORPORATE SOME OF THOSE PRACTICES THAT ARE INCLUSIVE OF THE EFFICIENCIES THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE TODAY. ALONG WITH THAT THE DEPARTMENT AS WELL AS THE CHILD SUPPORT DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN WORKING REALLY REALLY HARD TO IDENTIFY THE BEST PRACTICES THE EFFICIENCIES THAT HAVE. BUDGETARY IMPACTS AS WELL AS CUSTOMER IMPACTS AND I THINK WE HAVE A REALLY GREAT RELATIONSHIP AND THIS. BUDGET PROPOSAL WITH THE METHODOLOGY -- WE THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO GO FORWARD -- WITH AND WE ALSO I'M WILL NOT PREVENT -- US FOR COMING BACK AND AND REALLY -- COMING UPON AGREEMENT -- IN OTHER AREAS THANK YOU. THIS MEANS IN COMMON OKAY [inaudible] ALL RIGHT. SELL ALL RIGHT VERY GOOD. THE VOTE IS WILL CONTINUE ON AND THEN WE'LL HAVE PUBLIC COMMENT THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING UP HERE THANK YOU. LET'S MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER THREE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE IMPROVE PERFORMANCE INCENTIVES. SO THIS SAM AND THIS IS ASKING TO CONTINUE TO SUSPEND -- PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT INITIATIVES THAT WAS ESTABLISHED A LONG LONG TIME AGO -- THIS PROPOSAL I AM TYPICALLY WOULD HAVE HAD SIX MILLION DOLLARS DISTRIBUTED OUT AND AND OFTEN TO THE TOP TEN HIGHEST PERFORMING COUNTIES TYPICALLY THE MOST AFFLUENT COUNTIES. WOULD GET ALL OF THAT FUNDING SO WE DON'T FEEL LIKE THIS PERFORMANCE AND AN INCENTIVE PROGRAM IS WORKING WELL AND WE'VE GOT A A POTENTIAL AND ARE. MUCH METHODOLOGY TO CORRECT THIS SO IF THIS ALL WORKS OUT WILL CONTINUE TO GET TO A POINT WHERE REPLACE THIS WITH THE NOW. OKAY. YOU LA YOU COMMENTS ON THAT NO FINANCE. QUESTIONS ARE. EIGHT OKAY VERY GOOD WHEN WE MOVE ON ISSUE NUMBER FOUR TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE FEDERAL DEFICIT REDUCTION ACT MANDATORY FEE INCREASE. THIS IS A MANDATORY FEE PROVIDED -- ARE EXPECTED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SO AFTER FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS IS COLLECTED -- AND THERE'S A FEE OF TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS AS OPPOSED ON THE PARTICIPANTS IN OUR CASE LOAD. THEIR INCREASING THAT TO FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS IN COLLECTIONS WITH A THIRTY FIVE DOLLAR FEE SO THIS IS A LIMITED LANGUAGE TO COME INTO COMPLIANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS. EXCELLENT -- LA YOU THE COMMENTS FINANCE. QUESTIONS COMMITTEE MEMBERS ALL RIGHT. THE FEDS ARE MAKING US DO IT ALL RIGHT ISSUE NUMBER. FIVE HUMAN SERVICES TECHNICAL BCP VOLUNTARY PRAYER PARENTAGE ESTABLISHMENT PROGRAM. IN SUMMARY THIS -- PROPOSAL IS TO I I JUST OUR WAY OF DOING BUSINESS IN COMPLIANCE WITH AB -- TWENTY SIX EIGHTY FOUR CURRENTLY WE RUN A PATERNITY OPPORTUNITY -- PROGRAM -- WHERE ALL THE HOSPITALS AND -- BIRTHING CENTERS ACROSS CALIFORNIA ARE ABLE TO IDENTIFY AND AND ESTABLISH. PATERNITY. FOR FATHERS THAT ARE IN AND WEBER IS THIS EXPAND SET OUT -- TO SAME SEX MARRIAGES AND AND AND INCORPORATES A LOT MORE FOLKS SO WE WANTED TO I DID -- PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SUPPORT TO ROLL AND ENACT THIS LEGISLATION AND THREE YEARS I THINK WE'LL HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING WITH THE VOLUME IS TO SEE IF THERE'S FURTHER AUGMENTATION IS NEEDED OR IF WE CAN RETURN TO NORMAL LEVELS. OKAY THANK YOU -- ELIA INCOMES FINANCE [inaudible] QUESTIONS [inaudible] OKAY [inaudible] ALL RIGHT. EXCELLENT OKAY -- AND THEN FINALLY WE HAD TO HAVE A PROPOSAL FOR INVESTMENTS -- SO ACTUALLY MAKE A LITTLE ROOM AB SHIFT OVER -- ONE AND SEE IF WE HAVE -- ALICE LEAH FERGUSON -- LEGAL SERVICES FOR PRISONERS WITH CHILDREN AND JAMIE AUSTIN TIPPING POINT TO RE BE PRESENTING ITS REBUTTAL THIS IS -- LANGUAGE ON A CHILD SUPPORT COLLECTIONS [inaudible] WELCOME. AND IF YOU CAN ACTUALLY FIRST INTRODUCE YOURSELVES FOR THE RECORD ESPECIALLY ON THE MICROPHONES AND THEN -- SO IF YOU CAN -- RESCUE. TO BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU BIRTH PRESENTING -- THREE MINUTES AND THEN WE MAY HAVE QUESTIONS WE HAVE MORE TIME TO LEVERAGE. THANK YOU I'M JAMIE AWESOME A TIPPING POINT. I'M I LIVE FIGURES IN LEGAL SERVICES OF PRISONERS OF CHILDREN ALL OF US ARE NONE. A CERTAIN POINT IS A GRANT MAKING ORGANIZATION THAT FIGHTS POVERTY THAT AREA. NOW WE CO AUTHORED A REPORT TO REVEAL THAT EVERY YEAR HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIA CHILDREN LIVING IN POVERTY DO NOT RECEIVE. ALL OF THE CHILD SUPPORT PAYMENTS MADE BY THEIR PARENTS. FOR LOW INCOME PARENTS MOST OF THEIR CHILD SUPPORT PAYMENTS GO TO THE GOVERNMENT TO PAY BACK THE COST OF PUBLIC ASSISTANCE. AND NOT TO THEIR CHILDREN. NGUYEN NONCUSTODIAL PARENTS MOST OF WHOM ARE LOW INCOME MEN OF COLOR CANNOT REPAY THE COST OF PUBLIC ASSISTANCE THEY FACE SUSPENSION OF DRIVER'S AND PROFESSIONAL LICENSES AND INCARCERATION. THESE PENALTIES ARE COUNTERPRODUCTIVE. CALIFORNIA HAS ONE OF THE COUNTRY'S MOST STRINGENT POLICIES. YEAH WHEN PARENTS LOSE THEIR LICENSES THEY CANNOT STRIVE TO WORK AND OFTEN LOSE THE ABILITY TO PAY CHILD SUPPORT. BECAUSE DRIVERS LICENSE SUSPENSION IS INEFFECTIVE CALIFORNIA ELIMINATED THIS PRACTICE FOR FAILING TO PAY TRAFFIC COURT DEBT. MORE THAN 80% OF CALIFORNIA COUNTIES INCARCERATE FOR FAILURE TO PAY CHILD SUPPORT THAT EVEN WHEN THAT DEBT IS OWED TO THE GOVERNMENT. WHEN COURSE RATED PARENTS' DEATH ON PUBLIC ASSISTANCE GROWS EXPONENTIALLY? PERRANCE LEAVING JAIL WITH HIGH LEVELS OF DEBT ARE FAR MORE LIKELY TO EXIT THE FORMAL ECONOMY NOT PAY CHILD SUPPORT REDUCE CONTACT WITH THEIR WE SEE NO EVIDENCE THAT INCARCERATION OF LICENSE SUSPENSION INCREASES PAYMENT OF CHILD SUPPORT ORDERS WE ARE BUDGET ACTION TO END THESE INEFFECTIVE AND HARMFUL PRACTICES THANK YOU. THANK YOU -- I WORK AT A COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATION THAT -- ADVOCATES AND ORGANIZES FOR IT THE CIVIL AND HUMAN RIGHTS OF FORMALLY INCLUDING CRAZY PEOPLE AND THEIR FAMILIES. WE WERE HOPING TO HAVE SOMEONE IS DIRECTLY IMPACTED BY THE SYSTEM COME AND TELL YOU GUYS ABOUT HOW IT AFFECTS THEM -- BUT DID ALL KINDS OF STRUCTURAL BARRIERS THEY WEREN'T ABLE TO STOMACH CURRENTLY INCARCERATED SUMMER EACH CAR SERRATED MEANING THAT THEIR MOVEMENT IS RESTRICTED. BY A ANKLE MONITOR AND SOME WERE WORKING GRAVEYARD SHIFTS AND COULDN'T MISS THEIR THEIR TIME THERE -- AND SO IN PREPARING FOR THIS I TALK TO THEM ABOUT HOW THIS AFFECTED THEIR LIVES AND THE ISSUES THAT THEY WERE FACING AND IN THAT CONCERNS FELL INTO TWO MAIN BEAMS -- ONE BEING THAT THE CURRENT SYSTEM DIDN'T INVEST INVEST ENOUGH IN FAMILY UNITY AND THE OTHER THAT IT DIDN'T INVEST ENOUGH IN PUBLIC SAFETY. AND SO LIKE MY COLLEAGUE WAS TALKING ABOUT. I'M THESE SYSTEMS AT CREATE AN ADVERSARIAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PARENTS THAT ONE NOW FEELS LIKE THE OTHER HAS YOU KNOW SET THE SENT THE DA AFTER THEM AND AS IMPLIED THAT THERE THAT THE FATHER. OR THE OTHER ONE FEELS LIKE THEY'RE IN BEING CALL THE WELFARE QUEEN OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT IN THE FALL INTO THESE RACES TRIPS AND AND HEARD THE FAMILY ALONG THE WAY. AND IT'S ALWAYS THE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE CHILD WHO NOW FEELS LIKE THE FATHER'S NOT PROVIDING EVEN IF HE'S PAYING INTO THE SYSTEM THE CHILD OFTEN NEVER KNOWS THAT IN EVERY SEIZE ANY OF THAT MONEY -- FURTHER. THE DISCORD BETWEEN THE PARENTS -- INCREASES THE CHANCES OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE REFUSE TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WHICH IS A HUGE ISSUE FOR PUBLIC SAFETY -- AND AS MY COLLEAGUE WAS ALSO TALKING ABOUT DRIVER LICENSE SUSPENSIONS THAT INCREASES THE CHANCE OF PEOPLE DRIVING ON A SUSPENDED LICENSE BECAUSE THEY HAVE. TO AND INCREASES THE CHANCE OF POLICE CONTACT WHICH ALSO INCREASES THE CHANCE OF VIOLENCE -- AND FINALLY IT PUSHES PEOPLE INTO BLACK MARKETS WHERE THEY WON'T BE REACHED BY GARNISHMENT AND BANK LEVY AND CAN ACTUALLY GIVE MORE MONEY TO THE CHILD AND THEY GET THROUGH THE SYSTEM -- AND LASTLY I THIS THIS SYSTEM -- THIS INCENTIVIZE PEOPLE FROM. FROM SIGNING UP FOR PUBLIC BENEFITS BECAUSE OF THESE THINGS. OKAY THANK YOU THANKS VERY MUCH -- ANY COMMENTS FROM THE AGENCY. WITH REGARD TO THE FITNESS. IS A IN REGARD TO THE RED DAY TODAY IT IF YOU HAVE ANY OPINIONS YOU WISH TO EXPRESS ABOUT THE THE THAT THAT THAT THE PROPOSAL. AND NOTHING SPECIFIC ON THE COMMENTS WE DO UNDERSTAND AND DOESN'T LOW INCOME ARE PARTICULARLY IMPACTED -- PARTICULARLY WHEN IT COMES TO FORSMAN ACTIONS WITHIN SHOWS PER SYSTEM A LOT OF THESE THINGS ARE ESTABLISHED BY STATUTE AND ARE GOVERNED BY CERTAIN THRESHOLDS IN OBVIOUSLY THOSE ARE SHOWS CAN BE LOOKED AT TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS. ABILITY TO PAY IS A KEY PIECE OF WEATHER -- FOLKS ARE GETTING IMPACTED BY THESE OR NOT AND RIGHT NOW THAT'S NOT TYPICALLY A PART OF OUR THRESHOLDS AND THE FINAL RULE AND WE'VE WE'VE TALKED ABOUT ACTUALLY SPEAKS TO OUR NEED TO ADDRESS THAT MORE CLEARLY -- AN UPCOMING -- LEGISLATION TRIPLING WHICH THINGS LIKE THAT OKAY IN THAT THING TO PRY BE IMPORTANT TRACK CLARIFY WHAT'S FEDERAL REQUIREMENT VERSUS STATE OKAY AVAIL. COMMENTS FINANCE COMMENTS QUESTIONS MEMBERS OKAY. RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION AND IS THE DEPARTMENT WILL. IT WILL FIX WILL SEE WILL THINK ABOUT IN A CELL THANK YOU -- ALL RIGHT SO WE CAN TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT NOW ON IN THE SECTION SO -- ASK PEOPLE TO AND THEN A FOR YOURSELF AND THEN FIVE WHAT -- SO IT'S FOR ALL OF THE SECTIONS ON FOR A CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES SO -- PLEASE INTRODUCE YOURSELF AND SHOWS WHAT -- YOU THINK ALL RIGHT THANK YOU WELCOME THE CURRENT FUNDING STRUCTURE OVER THE LAST TWENTY YEARS HAS CREATED INCONSISTENCY IN AVAILABLE RESOURCES FROM COUNTY TO COUNTY TO CARRY OUT THE MANDATORY. MANDATES OF THE PROGRAM WHICH HAS SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON FAMILIES. SACRAMENTO COUNTY AS A CASELOAD OF MORE THAN SEVENTY THREE THOUSAND CASES. THE FAMILIES THAT ARE IN OUR CASE LOAD MORE THAN 80% OF THEM ARE CURRENTLY ON ASSISTANCE OR FORMALLY ON ASSISTANCE. AND IN ORDER FOR THEM TO EITHER MAINTAIN SELF SUFFICIENCY OR MOVE OUT OF SELF SUFFICIENCY CHILD SUPPORT IN THIS IS AN ESSENTIAL PART. OF THE INCOME COMING INTO THEIR FAMILY. CHILD SUPPORT IS A CRITICAL TOOL IN THE STATE'S EFFORTS TO COMBAT -- CHILD POVERTY I APPRECIATE THE THE CONCERNS THAT WERE BROUGHT UP ABOUT QUESTIONS THAT STILL THAT STILL REMAIN AND AND THINGS THAT WE CAN LOOK AT I DON'T KNOW THAT IT PRECLUDES US. TO TO IMPLEMENT A METHODOLOGY FROM ADDRESSING SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS THAT CAN THE METHODOLOGY MAY NOT BE PERFECT CAN BE REFINED. I ASK FOR YOUR RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT.

I WE CURRENTLY HAVE A LARGE PORTFOLIO OF A MULTI PROGRAM -- PROJECTS AND ALL JUST HIT THE HIGHLIGHTS OF EACH OF THOSE THAT YOU HAVE OUTLINED IN THE AGENDA -- THE FIRST ONE THE APPEALS CASEMANAGEMENT SYSTEM IS A SYSTEM THAT ENSURES DUE PROCESS. FOR CLIENTS ACROSS A VARIETY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES PROGRAMS. AND IT HELPS THE FACILITATION OF THE ADJUDICATION OF CLAIMS FOR THE STATE HEARINGS DIVISION. WE HAVE ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTED THAT SYSTEM AND IT IS IN THE PROCESS OF BEING TRANSITION BACK TO THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES IN YOUR YOU'LL HEAR ABOUT A BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL ABOUT THAT LATER.

DOING IS IT IS MODERNIZING -- THE EXISTING ERIC MARBURY SWITCHING TO A MODERN MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM BECAUSE THE CURRENT. ONE IS NOT GOING -- TO ALLOW FOR V. -- CONNECTION TO D. V. T. BECAUSE WE HAVE A FEDERAL MANDATE TO DELIVER BENEFITS LIKE CHRONICALLY IN THE WEEK PROGRAM. IN -- TWENTY TWENTY CURRENTLY WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF APPROACHING A PILOT FOR THAT PROJECT. AND IN MAY AND THEN THROUGH AUGUST -- TWENTY NINETEEN TO APRIL OF TWENTY TWENTY THERE WILL BE A TEN WAY IF. IMPLEMENTATION -- TO ROLL THAT OUT -- TO LOCAL AGENCIES AND COUNTIES.

I'M WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON OUR DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS -- CONTINUE TO MOVE THOSE FORWARD CONTINUE TO KEEP THE LIGHTS ON FOR THE MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS PIECES THAT WE HAVE. WHICH IS YOU KNOW INCLUDES NOT ONLY KEEPING THE LIGHTS ON BUT THEN ALSO MAKING SYSTEM CHANGES THAT ARE REQUIRED BY BOTH POLICY AND LAW. OKAY THANK YOU -- COMES FROM OHIO [inaudible] FINANCE. AND BEFORE WE GET TO QUESTIONS ME -- AND I APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE -- COLLEGE CAN CAN MAYBE CAN YOU JUST SPEAK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN -- OUR MINUTES IT DEPARTMENT A AT FIVE TECHNOLOGY AND AND SYSTEMS INTEGRATION REALIZING THAT YOU KNOW YOU. SEE A LOT OF EIGHTY PROJECTS GOING ON AND I KNOW THAT THE FARM TECHNOLOGY DOES A GOOD PROVIDE SUPPORT AND ASSISTANCE IN SOME OF OUR SITE AS WELL YEAH. THAT'S CORRECT AND WE DO ALL THOSE -- WITH -- THE OFFICE SYSTEM INTEGRATION. SO -- OUR INTERACTIONS -- CAN IT CAN RUN THE GAMUT FROM -- ADVISORY AS WELL AS CONSULTANT -- AND WE DO THIS IN MALTA THE MULTITUDE OF WAYS BUT SIGH AND DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY PARTNER AT LEAST ON A MONTHLY BASIS AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS. OF GOING OVER THE PORTFOLIO ENSURING THAT WE HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THE STATE AND STATUS OF EACH -- PROJECT IS AND GIVEN THAT GUIDANCE AS WELL AS WHEN NECESSARY DIRECTIVE OF HOW THE PROJECT SHOULD BE -- MOVING FORWARD FOR SUCCESS -- IN ADDITION WE HAVE DIRECT PROJECT OVERSIGHT OF THEREPORT WILL NON DELEGATED IS NOW THE NEW TERM -- PROJECTS -- MUCH MANY OF THEM IN THE OFFICE SYSTEM INTEGRATION OR pENOUGH CRITICAL ENOUGH THAT WE PUT IN BETTER OVERSIGHT. SO WE HAVE STAFF THEIR ON SITE WITH THE PROJECT MONITORING OBSERVING REPORTING YOU CAN SEE A REPORTS ON A WEBSITE -- AND MANY OF THESE -- PROJECTS HAVE -- UP TO DATE REPORTING SO YOU CAN SEE WITH THIS THE STATUS OF THOSE PROJECTS ARE. EXCELLENT THANK YOU. QUESTIONS REMEMBERS. SO I'D SELL. THE I. T. IS ONE OF THOSE AREAS WHERE USUALLY THE ONLY NEWS HERE ABOUT SOME THINGS DON'T GO WELL. SO -- MAYBE THIS AN OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE WHAT THINGS. WELL YOU MIGHT TELL ME WHETHER WHAT WELL OR NOT SO -- DOES THAT AND WE'LL GET TOUCH AND SO THE BIGGER SYSTEMS A LITTLE LATER BUT THE EXAMPLE APPEALS CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM YOU'RE BEING FROM DEVELOPMENT TO MAINTENANCE OPERATION PHASE -- YES YOU ON BUDGET ON TIME. YES. OKAY AND AND HELP WITH THE WHAT WAS THE OVERALL BUDGET FOR DOING THIS TINO OVERALL PROJECT YEAH THE FEELS CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. OKAY. HOW DO I COME UP AND HOW MUCH? EIGHT EIGHTEEN POINT EIGHT MILLION OKAY BUT ALL RIGHT SO -- SO I WILL I I'M NOT SURE GO SEE ANYTHING ON THAT SECOND AB COUNSELOR. FEELS MAKE CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM A TWENTY MILLION ON BUDGET ON TIME BUT BY SIDE THE KNOWLEDGE THAT YEAH. THE CAN I ALSO ADD THIS. ON BUDGET ON TIME GREAT METRICS FOR FOR PROJECTS ASSESS BUT REALLY WHEN I LOOK AT A CMS IS DELIVERING THE BUSINESS VALUE THAT SUPPORTS THE BUSINESS FUNCTIONS. AND I THINK -- IF IF YOU WERE ABLE TO SPEAK WITH THE BUSINESS BEING SUPPORTED BY THE SYSTEM I MEAN THAT'S THAT IS THE TRUE MEASURE OF SUCCESS. AND I APPRECIATE -- THAT COMMENT ONE OF THE THINGS I SOMETIMES ALSO ASKED WE MAKE IT INVESTMENTS AND WE GET IT. IS THAT ARE CAN WE PROVE -- ENGINE INCREASED EFFICIENCY BOTH IN -- INCREASED EFFICIENCY AND INCREASE PRODUCTIVITY OF THE STAFF BECAUSE THAT'S IDEALLY WHAT THIS IS GOING TO ALLOW THEM TO DO THE GIVEN GREATER CAPACITY TO DO THE WORK THAT WE ASK THEM TO DO. AND I KNOW WE HAVE -- WE ACTUALLY HAVE SOME THE MOST EFFICIENT STATE WORKERS IN THE IN THE COUNTRY WITH THE LOWEST RATIO STATE WORKERS. TO POPULATION AND AND IN THE COUNTRY ONE THE LOWEST -- BUT AS WE INVEST IN I. T. AND WE PUT IN OUR EIGHTEEN L.. MILLION -- HUNDRED MILLION FOR SOMETHING ELSE SOME OF THE BIGGER SYSTEMS AND SO FORTH -- THAT THAT RETURN SHOULD INVOLVED BETTER SERVICE AND GREATER EFFICIENCY MORE CAPACITY FOR FOR OUR FIRM PLACER DOING ITSELF. YEAH -- YEAH. AND THEN -- LET'S SEE TO IT -- THE CASE MANAGER INFORMATION HEY ROLLING SYSTEM THAT ONE IS -- CURRENTLY IN MAINTENANCE OPERATIONS SO THAT WAS ON BUDGET ON TIME. YEP OKAY SEE MORE GOOD NEWS ALRIGHT. OKAY ONES THAT ONE'S BEEN A PLACE FOR QUITE AWHILE YEAH IT'S TRUE HAS A RICH HISTORY HAS A RICH HISTORY BUT IT'S WORKING WELL [inaudible] SIR CAN. IS IT OKAY ALL RIGHT OKAY BUT CURRENT EFFORTS AT UNIV FOR TRANSITIONING TO THE NEW VENDOR AND CONTINUING TO PROVIDE THE FUNCTIONALITY THAT'S BENEFICIAL TO THE BOTH THE RECIPIENTS AND PROVIDERS I MEAN IS YOU KNOW IT CAN TAKE TIME AND I THAT HAS WORKED WELL. YEAH AND I THINK THE OTHER THING WE'RE ACTUALLY TRYING TO MOVE AWAY FROM THIS I CALLED BIG BANG APPROACH WOULD BASICALLY LIKE OKAY WE'RE GOING AND WE'RE BUILDING THIS BIG BOOM HE MISSED IT PROJECT RIGHT. INSTEAD IT'S A CREATING A SYSTEM THAT'S EVOLUTIONARY IS NOT LIKE -- WE'VE BUILT IN AND IT'S DONE AND THEN OF COURSE IT GETS OUT OF DATE AND HOWEVER MANY YEARS BUT IT'S SYSTEM THAT CONSTANTLY INVOLVES IS MODULAR AND SO FORTH AND CAN ADD FUNCTIONALITY OVERTIME AND I'D JUST LIKE WE HAVE TO REBUILD IT EVERY TIME. AND I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS TO THAT YOU'LL HEAR YOU KNOW CONSISTENTLY WHEN WE TALK ABOUT RELEASES OR IMPLEMENTATION IS THAT WE REALLY TAKE THAT TO HEART IN TERMS OF A WAVE TO PRO. NO GIVEN THE THE DIVERSE CITY -- FOR THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES AND THEIR NEEDS YEAH DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO ROLL EVERYTHING OUT OF THE SINGLE TIME IN A SINGLE BLAST SO WE'RE DEFINITELY SENSITIVE TO THAT IN TERMS OF SUCCESS. OKAY. ALL RIGHT WELL I WON'T KEEP ROLLING DOWN THE SYSTEMS THAT WAY BUT BUT IT'S ONLY THEY THINK THAT WOULD HAPPEN IT IN ANY I REALIZE IT'S NOT EXCITING NEWS TO SAY OH YEAH THE EIGHTY SYSTEM WORKS -- BUT I THINK SOMETIMES THE ONLY NEWS WE HERE'S THE ID SYSTEM DOESN'T WORK NOT TO MEET THERE ARE TIMES THINGS HAVE NOT WORKED VERY WELL AND WE'VE HAD A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT APPROPRIATELY BUT I DID WANT. TO TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO POINT OUT THAT SOMETIMES THAT ACTUALLY THINGS DO WORK MORE OFTEN SOME PEOPLE EXPECT WHEN HE COMES IT. ALL RIGHT THERE'S NO OTHER QUESTIONS -- WE'RE GONNA TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT THE END OF THIS SECTION -- SO LET'S MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER -- TWO SO NOW DIVING INTO SOME OF OUR BIGGER SYSTEMS THE CHILD WELFARE SERVICES CALIFORNIA -- A RESPONSE IN ENGAGEMENT SYSTEM UPDATE. RIGHT PEOPLE WANT. PEOPLE COMING UP THE TABLE TO INTRODUCE HIMSELF TO THE RECORD. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBER -- PALLY REACTING DIRECTOR DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES THANK YOU. IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO BE. EXACTLY GOOD MORNING I'M BECKY STEALING A MONTH THE OFFICES SYSTEMS INTEGRATION OKAY WELCOME ALL RIGHT. WE BEGIN. OKAY OKAY. THANK YOU FOR GIVING US SOME OF YOUR TIME THIS AFTERNOON I'M CURRENTLY THE PROJECT DIRECTOR OF THE CARES PROJECT AND THAT'S THE CHILD WELFARE -- REPLACEMENT PROJECT WE'VE HAD A SYSTEM IN PLACE. FOR SINCE THE EARLY NINETIES -- AND THIS PROJECT IS DESIGNED -- TO REPLACE THAT SYSTEM WITH MORE MODERN TECHNOLOGIES AND MORE MODERN CAPABILITIES FOR CHILD WELFARE WORKERS. THROUGHOUT THE STATE. HAND THIS PAST YEAR WE'VE BEEN WORKING VERY INTENSIVELY ON IDENTIFYING AND AND IMPLEMENTING WAYS TO IMPROVE. OUR CAPACITY AND CAPABILITY TO DELIVER MORE FASTER -- BUT WE'VE ALSO BEEN ABLE TO HAVE -- SEVERAL STATEWIDE RELEASES OF FUNCTIONALITY OF THE CARE SYSTEM -- FROM OCTOBER OF THIS PAST YEAR TO CURRENTLY WE'VE -- BEEN ABLE TO RELEASE OF FOUR MAJOR AREAS OF FEATURES -- TO COUNTY WORKERS IDENTITY MANAGEMENT IS ONE OF THOSE FEATURES A PROVIDES FOR THE SECURE LOG IN AND MANAGEMENT OF USER ACCESS AND PERMISSIONS TO THE CARE SYSTEM -- WE IMPLEMENTED A FEATURE THAT WE REFER TO A SNAPSHOT WHICH IS A SEARCH CAPABILITY. THAT -- LEVERAGES INFORMATION FROM THE LEGACY SYSTEM AND MAKES IT POSSIBLE FOR A WORKER TO SEE AND ONE SIMPLE WAY -- DEMOGRAPHIC IN CASE MANAGEMENT AND HISTORY INFORMATION. WE'VE IMPLEMENTED THE FACILITY SEARCH CAPABILITY WHICH IS LINKING -- THREE LEGACY SYSTEMS CHILD -- THE THE LEGACY CHAO WELFARE SYSTEM AS WELL AS FACILITY AND LICENSING INFORMATION FROM US SYSTEMS OF SOCIAL SERVICES MANAGES. AND THAT GIVES THE WORKER INFORMATION ABOUT THE FACILITIES AND HOMES AND A CAPACITY OF VARIOUS FACILITIES FOR CHILD PLACEMENT SO -- THOSE TWO TOOLS -- IN -- HAVE BEEN -- REMARKABLY WELL RECEIVED A BUYER COUNTIES. AND THE LAST I WANTED TO MENTION THAT WE'VE IMPLEMENTED -- EIGHTH -- FEATURE THAT WE REFER TO AS CANS WHICH IS THE CHILD AND pADOLESCENT NEEDS AND STRENGTHS ASSESSMENT. THIS IS THE FIRST OF AN AUTOMATION EFFORT OF HELPING THE STATE WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION. OF AN INTEGRATED CORE PRACTICE MODEL UNDER THE CONTINUUM OF CARE REFORM AND THIS. ASSESSMENT ALLOWS A CHILD WELFARE WORKER -- TO TO WORK THROUGH THE THE THE STANDARDIZED QUESTIONS ABOUT -- CHILDREN AND AND THEIR THEIR CURRENT SITUATION AND THEN PROVIDES THAT OPPORTUNITY IN IN THE CARE SYSTEM. TO KEEP IT TO SEE IT AGAIN -- TO LEVERAGE IT FOR FUTURE REASSESSMENTS -- AND THEN -- WITH WITH MORE FUNCTIONALITY TO COME TO ASSIST -- WITH THAT EFFORT [inaudible] SO -- WITH THOSE WITH THOSE FEATURES IN KEEPING WITH THE ENTERED OF DEPLOYMENT APPROACH WE WE CREATE THOSE CAPABILITIES WE RELEASE THEM WE GET FEEDBACK WE GET ADDED -- INSIDE AND WE CONTINUE TO ENHANCE THEM AND SO -- WE HAVE ADDITIONAL RELEASES PLAN FOR ALL OF THOSE FEATURES IN APRIL AND WE ALSO HAVE ADDITIONAL -- FEATURES -- PLANNED IN JULY IN JULY IN PARTICULAR FOR CANS WILL BE THE OPPORTUNITY -- FOR A REASSESSMENT TO TAKE PLACE AND A CHILD WELFARE WORKER WILL HAVE -- BE ABLE TO SEE WHAT THAT WAS REPORTED FOR KERRY THAT INFORMATION AND TRY TO IMPROVE SOME FUNCTIONALITY -- SKEWS ME EFFICIENCY AND USE OF THAT SO -- OF THOSE OF THOSE ARE ALL -- ACCOMPLISHMENTS THAT -- WERE PLEASED WITH BUT AS I SAID WE'RE WORKING ON IMPROVING OUR CAPACITY AND AND CAPABILITY -- I THINK -- WE WANTED TO MENTION I THINK AS A RESULT OF THE QUESTION THAT WE HAVE SPENT APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED AND TWENTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS -- TO DATE ON THIS PROJECT AND THE BUDGET THAT'S REFLECTED IN THE NOTES HERE OR YOU KNOW PROVIDES ADDITIONAL DETAIL ON THAT. WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO PROCEED TO QUESTION TWO OR DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING. IN WHICH GOOD PROCEED WITH THE THE OF THE CHANGE PROCESS OKAY GOOD -- YES IT'S TRUE LAST LAST SUMMER -- OUR PARTNER FEDERAL PARTNERS ADMINISTRATION CHILDREN YOUTH AND FAMILIES A SEE WHY OFF -- DID A SITE VISIT AND WE REPORT TO THEM ON A REGULAR BASIS JUST AS WE WORK WITH C. D. T. ON AN ONGOING BASIS -- FOR THEIR HELP IN AND GUIDANCE THEY'RE MANAGING ALL THE STATES ARE DOING THESE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEMS AND SO THEY HAVE SOME GOOD INSIDE -- AND THEY BRING SOME EXPERTISE THAT WAS WELCOMED -- BY US INCLUDING HOW TO OPTIMIZE YOUR AGILE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT APPROACH AND AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THEY STRONGLY RECOMMENDED WE WE SAY DIRECTED BUT IT WAS A WELCOME DIRECTION AND THAT WAS -- INSTEAD OF TRYING TO DO TOO MANY THINGS AT ONE TIME WHICH I THINK. IS STATE I TO PROJECTS ARE COMPLEX AND THEIR LARGE AND WE ALWAYS WANT TO GET THEM DONE QUICKLY AND SO I THINK IN SOME RESPECTS WE SAID. LET'S HURRY UP AND GET EVERYTHING DONE A WHILE THEY SAID. DO ONE THING AT A TIME AND AND GET THAT PRACTICE DOWN IN IN A REPEATABLE WAY ULTIMATELY TO GET TO THE POINT OF SCALING AND THAT THAT WAS ACTUALLY PRETTY WISE ADVICE AND WE TOOK IT TO HEART BECAUSE APPRECIATING THE THE THE VERY LARGE AND COMPLEX AND AND AS AS A MATTER. OF PRACTICE THE DYNAMIC NATURE OF CHILD WELFARE IT'S NOT A LINEAR PROCESS CHILDREN. LIVE SIR -- CHANGING ALL THE TIME CONDITIONS ARE CHANGING ALL THE TIME AND YOU WANT YOUR SYSTEM. TO BE SUFFICIENTLY ADAPTIVE AND COMPLETE TO ACCOMPLISH THAT SO. SO WE BEGAN TO REALIZE WE SHOULD WORK ON THAT ONE DIGITAL SERVICE AT A TIME GET THAT STRONG. AND WELL DEVELOPED AND THEN BUILD ON THAT AND WORK TOWARDS ADDITIONAL CAPACITY. IT'S ALSO -- DEVELOPING THE PRACTICE -- OUR OWN CAPABILITY TO FOLLOW THESE PRACTICES WHILE. TOM. THE OF THE ONE THING AT A TIME APPROACH TO DOING THIS WE BELIEVE WILL ACTUALLY ACCELERATE ULTIMATELY ACCELERATE OUR DELIVERY AND NOT TAKE LONGER BECAUSE WHAT WE HAD FOUND IN THE FIRST -- TWO YEARS OF OUR EFFORT WAS THERE WAS CERTAINLY THE THE% RISK OF HAVING DIFFERENT GROUPS DEVELOP THINGS DIFFERENTLY AND THEN WE END UP HAVING TO RECONCILE THEM LATER AND POTENTIALLY TO RE WORK SO IT MAKES MORE SENSE. TO FOCUS ON COMPONENTS AND SERVICES THAT ARE HOLISTIC AND AND GET THOSE DONE AND THEN LEVERAGE WHAT YOU DID THERE FOR THE FUTURE THINGS SO WE ACTUALLY WELCOME THAT RECOMMENDATION WE THINK IT IS THE RIGHT APPROACH -- FOR OUR PROJECT AT THIS TIME. OKAY THANK YOU A COMMENCEMENT LEO. PRIME MINISTER LA -- WE WOULD JUST MENTION THAT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT THE ADMINISTRATION WILL BE SUBMITTING -- SPECIAL PROJECT REPORT TO ACTUALLY UPDATE THE BASELINE COST AND SCHEDULE FOR THIS PROJECT AND SO IT'S OUR INTENT TO ANALYZE AND PROVIDE -- OUR COMMENTS ON THAT ONCE IT'S AVAILABLE. OKAY THANK YOU FINANCE QUESTIONS. THEY TELL US WHAT TECHNOLOGY. OF JUST THAT AGAIN WE'VE BEEN -- SIDE BY SIDE WITH THIS PROJECT THROUGH THIS JOURNEY THEY ARE THE DEMONSTRATION PROJECT -- I'VE BEEN HERE. A FEW OF THESE BUDGET CYCLES IN WHICH THIS WAS THE FIRST ONE THAT WAS BLAZING THE TRAIL ON TRAIN NEW METHODOLOGIES SO. WHAT'S GREAT ABOUT IT IS THE LESSONS LEARNED WE DON'T HAVE TO WAIT FOR THIS PROJECT TO BE OVER FOUR THIS FOR A CHANGE IN DIRECTION OR TAKE THE LESSONS LEARNED AND MODIFY SO WE CAN BE BETTER. BEFORE YOU YOU ACTUALLY GET TO DONE. AND SO IN THAT REGARD WERE. WE WE APPRECIATE THIS REFLECTION WE WERE WITH -- THE PROJECT WITH A C. Y. F. WHEN ALL OF THIS DISCOVERY WAS OCCURRING LAST YEAR. WE CONCEPTUALLY AGREE WITH THE RECOMMENDATION BUT WE DO WANT TO WORK WITH THE PROJECT TO MAKE SURE THERE'S A A ROBUST STRATEGY. THAT IS ARTICULATED IN THE SPECIAL PROJECT REPORTS OF WILL WE ARE WORKING WITH THEM THROUGH THAT PROCESS. THANK YOU. I WOULD ALSO ADD THAT TIME IT IS A CONDITION OF THIS PROJECT THAT WE DO REGULAR REPORTING TO LEGISLATIVE STAFF VIA A MONTHLY REPORTS AND THEN ALSO QUARTERLY BRIEFINGS. SEVEN IT'S NOT JUST AT BUDGET HEARINGS THAT THIS IS INFORMATION AVAILABLE ON THIS PROJECT. THANK YOU THANK YOU. QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. SET ASIDE AND APPRECIATE -- YOUR YOUR YOUR SPOTS BECAUSE I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT CAME UP BEFORE AND I I SUPPORT THE EDGE OUTRAGE. BUT IT ALSO I THINK CREATED SOME NEW CHALLENGES FOR OVERSIGHT RIGHT. AND SO I LIKE IT'S MY QUESTIONS THE A -- IS BECAUSE LAST TIME YOU KNOW YOU RAISE CONCERNS. IN TERMS OF SO WHAT -- SO ARE WE USE TO EVOLVING OUR PROCESSES IN A WAY A TWO TO TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE NEED TO THE APPROPRIATE OVERSIGHT AND AND AN AGILE PROCESS OR THINGS THAT. THE USE THAT WE SHOULD BE DATA. OTHER THINGS YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT TERMS OF HOW WE HOW WE DO THIS OF OVERSIGHT WHILE STILL ALLOWING -- THIS THIS -- PROCESS TO MOVE FORWARD BECAUSE I THINK THIS IS THE PRICE WE SHOULD TAKEN IT IN MY OPINION. I'M NOT THE EXPERT BUT I THINK WE'RE HEARING FROM THAT YEAH -- BRENT METZ GIRLY I TIED -- TO BY I APPRECIATE THE THE COMMENT I THINK WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF TRYING TO DETERMINE HOW BEST TO PROVIDE OVERSIGHT OF PROJECTS THAT ARE USING THIS AGILE APPROACH -- WE DO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IT MAY BE HARD TO ESTABLISH YOU KNOW AN ENTIRE PROJECT KOSTER ENTIRE PROJECT SCHEDULE GIVEN THAT YOU MAY NOT KNOW ALL OF THE PIECES OF THE PROJECT. AT THIS TIME HOWEVER WE'RE STILL CONCERNED THAT YOU DON'T HAVE THAT COMPLETE PORTFOLIO VIEW TO KNOW KIND OF ALL OF THE DIFFERENT MODULES THAT ARE PART OF A PROJECT AS WELL AS THE COST OF EACH OF THEM SO. I THINK WE'RE STILL IN THE EARLY PHASES OF TRYING TO FIGURE THIS OUT AS WELL -- BUT WE'RE CERTAINLY LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS SPECIAL PROJECT REPORT AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO DID EVALUATE HOW BEST TO PROVIDE OVERSIGHT GOING FORWARD. AND THE CERTAINLY APPRECIATED WE GOT FIGURE OUT HOW TO HOW TO MAKE THIS WORK. SO I'M GONNA I AM GOING TO ASK YOU QUESTIONS OF OVERSIGHT ISSUE SO. DEL PASTOR YOU USED SHAREDLISTS THE MODULES THAT YOU'RE DOING UP TO APRIL TWENTY NINETEEN YOU MENTIONED THERE'S A JULY RELEASE. BUDGET PROPOSAL YOU KNOW LAST YEAR. WAS NINETY NINE POINT EIGHT MILLION FATAL FIFTY MILLION GENERAL FUND IT'S ACTUALLY ONLY THIRTEEN MILLION FOR THIS COMING YEAR -- SO -- FIRED ERROR SO BEYOND ACTUALLY WHAT'S GOING TO BE IN THE JULY RELEASE AND WHAT THE WHAT KIND OF AT LEAST FUNCTIONALITIES ASIANS AND NOT SO MUCH THE RELEASES ITS WHAT KIND OF FUNCTIONALITY LOOKING. TO TO TO ADD IN THE COMING YEAR YOU MAY NOT KNOW THE MALL BUT I'M JUST LIKE WHAT ARE YOU PLANNING -- FOR IN TERMS OF YOUR YOUR AS YOU SAID ONE AT A TIME OKAY SO WHAT WHAT IT WHAT KIND OF FUNCTIONALITIES ARE YOU LOOKING AT TRYING TO DO FOR OUR THIRTEEN MILLION OF GENERAL FUND TWENTY SIX MILLION. I'LL HAVE BECKY TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT -- THE FUNCTIONALITY IN THE JULY RELEASE AND THEN I CAN TOUCH LITTLE BIT ON THE ON THE ON THE BUDGET OKAY THANK YOU -- WITH IT IN KEEPING WITH THE AT JOE APPROACH -- WE'VE LEARNED A AND ANOTHER MAJOR PRINCIPLE OF THIS PROJECT IS THAT WE WOULD USE UTILIZE USER RESEARCH AND USER CENTERED DESIGN -- WHICH MEANS A GREAT DEAL MORE CLOSE WORKING RELATIONSHIP AND AND AND SORT OF JUST IN TIME WORKING RELATIONSHIP PARTICULARLY WITH COUNTIES OTHER THAN THAT THE LARGEST NUMBER OF USERS BUT BUT IN SOME CASES SOCIAL SERVICES STAFF AS WELL -- TO PLAN THE NEXT THING -- AND AND TO BEGIN TO ARTICULATE WHAT OF THOSE -- BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS NOT JUST THE PAST ONES BUT THE FUTURE ONES AND SO WE HAVE TEAMED UP TO OTHER -- AREAS THAT WE HAVEN'T SELECTED YET FOR THE NEXT THING -- AND THAT THAT. IS IS PART OF THE ARTICULATION OF OUR S. P. R. BUT QUITE A BIT OUR USER CENTERED DESIGN A RESEARCH HAS TAKEN PLACE IN THE HOT LINE AREA WHICH IS THE INTAKE PROCESS FOR CHILD WELFARE CASES. AND THE RESOURCE FAMILY -- APPLICATION PROCESS AND THAT'S A FOR FOR PEOPLE -- TO APPLY TO BE HOMES AND FACILITIES FOR CHILDREN TO BE PLACED SO -- BOTH OF THOSE ARE OUR CANDIDATES WERE IT QUITE A BIT OF BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS HAVE BEEN ARTICULATED. WE WE WANT TO DO IS HAVE ENOUGH -- DEPTH AND CLARITY ABOUT -- THOSE REQUIREMENTS AND PARTICULARLY THE VALUE PROPOSITION ONE OF THOSE METRICS THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR TO ACHIEVE WHEN WE IMPLEMENT. WHEN THAT WORK IS READY THEN THE DEVELOPERS ARE READY TO GO WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE THAT WORK SLOWDOWN DEVELOPMENT WE SAW A LITTLE OF THAT AT THE BEGINNING OF OUR PROJECTS SO -- SO WE'RE WE'RE PLEASED WITH THIS REALIZATION WE HAVE ONE THING WE'RE DOING NEXT THING WE DO SO THERE'S KIND OF AN ITERATION AND THAT WAY. AND THEN REGARDING THE BUDGET YOU KNOW THE LA -- POINTS OUT CORRECTLY THAT YOU KNOW YOU USING THIS METHOD IT'S HARD TO YOU KNOW AT SASSON PREDICT HOW MUCH THE TOTAL PROJECT COST IS GOING TO BE AND AS A RESULT. WE'VE BEEN YOU KNOW UP GETTING APPROVAL ONE YEAR AT A TIME. AS OPPOSED TO A TRADITIONAL AS PR WHERE IT'S A LONGER VIEW SO THE NUMBER THAT'S ACTUALLY IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IS A PLACEHOLDER PENDING. AN UPDATE WITH THE SPECIAL PROJECT REPORT AN INMATE REVISION [inaudible] YES HELLO -- AND I WOULD JUST ALSO NOTE THAT WE ARE AWARE OF THE DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY IS ALSO KIND OF LOOKING INTO HOW THEY'RE UPDATING OTHER PROJECTS AS WELL THAT ARE USING NATURAL APPROACH SO IT MIGHT BE. USEFUL TO US THEM AS WELL OKAY YEAH AND IT IT IS -- STILL IN DEVELOPMENT BUT DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY THROUGH -- OUR EXPERIENCES WITH THESE AT JOE PROJECTS THERE'S A REALIZATION THAT YOU CAN PROJECT OUT -- WITH CERTAINTY ONLY SO FAR AND WE'VE SEEN WITH ALL THE WATERFALL PROJECTS THEY MAY GIVE YOU A FIVE YEAR SCHEDULE ON A COST BUT HOW MANY OF THEM HAVE BEEN ABLE TO HOLD TO IT AGAIN THERE'S JUST TOO MUCH UNCERTAINTY THAT FAR OUT. WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR IS MORE OF AN ANNUAL UPDATE SO THAT -- THAT WE WE CAN SEE ON AN ANNUAL BASIS WHAT WAS THE PLAN. YOU KNOW WHAT IS THE ROAD MAP THAT YOU THAT YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING TO TO GO FORWARD WITH TO DEVELOP THESE PRODUCTS. AND THEN WERE ABLE TO EVALUATE HOW DID YOU DO AGAINST THAT PLAN FOR FOR ANOTHER TWELVE MONTHS AND DOING THIS ON A ROLLING WAVE TYPE OF BASIS MORE OF AN ANNUAL UPDATE VERSES. THE CONNOTATION THAT IT'S A VARIANCE IN A SPECIAL PROJECT REPORT EVERY TIME SO WE LOOKING. TO DEVELOP THOSE PROCESSES AND POLICIES AND WERE WERE IN FLIGHT WITH THAT RIGHT NOW. HEY. YEAH I MEAN I THINK THE THE THIS IS WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT -- BASICALLY ABOUT THE NEW OVERSIGHT METHODOLOGIES -- OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT WERE HERE ALLOCATING MONEY IN THE HOUSE IT'S YOU. THIS IS LIKE THIS HEARINGS IN THE SHORTER TO INVEST THAT YOU KNOW YOU HAVE PEOPLE STAND LINE AND I HAVE PEOPLE ASKING ME. FOR ALL ASKING THE LEGISLATURE'S NOT ME AND JUST HEARING SUBCOMMITTEE BUT WE HAVE REQUESTS THAT RANGES FROM SOMETIMES AS LOW AS HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS AND AND TELL THE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS. AND SO WE SAY OKAY WELL WE'RE GOING TO GIVE. THIRTEEN MILLION FOR THIS -- I WAS THE NEXT QUESTION IS WHAT WE GET FOR IT RIGHT WHAT'S THE FOUR EIGHT AND THEN YOU'RE GOING WELL WE WERE STILL FIGURING IT OUT -- AND AND I AM OF THE I WANT TO SAY IS I REALLY DO APPRECIATE I'M ALWAYS I AM REALLY HAPPY TO YEARS IT WILL APPROACH AS WE FIRST TALKED TO PEOPLE TO USE THE SYSTEM. I THINK OUR BIGGEST FAILURES ARE ONES WHERE SOMEONE SAID I'M GONNA HIRE A SOMEONE TO DO A TECHNOLOGY SOLUTION BUT NOT TALKING TO PEOPLE USING IT I'D I THINK I KNOW WHAT THEY WANT. THE VENDORS HAPPY TO TELL YOU WHAT THEY THINK THEY WANTED WITH THE PEOPLE WANT THEY DID TALK TO THEM. AND YOU WONDER WHY DOESN'T WORK -- SO. EIGHT DEAD ACTUALLY THE MOST IMPORTANT IT PROJECTS NOT THE I. T. PARTS THE PEOPLE PART THE PEOPLE IN YOUR FACE I'D REALLY HAPPY TO HEAR THAT. BUT I THINK WE WE DO NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW -- WE GET THIS ACCOUNTABILITY PIECE HOW SO AS YOU MAKE YOUR DECISION AS TO WHICH WHICH ONE YOU WANT TO GO TO AND THEN ALSO. THAT HOW HOW HOW TO BE SURE THAT WE DO HAVE APPROPRIATE OVERSIGHT -- ACCOUNTABILITY IN ITS IT AND AND AND ALSO -- THERE'S A THE THERE'S ALSO A BIT ABOUT -- YOU KNOW OF I GUESS WE CAUGHT HELLO WHAT THREE TERM WOULD BE. SO OKAY NOW WE DECIDED TO USE THIS BUT IS IS THE COST EFFICIENCY RIGHT IS THAT WHAT WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS THAT IS THAT IS THE REQUEST RIGHT YEAH WE LIKE TO FISH WE OVER THE FIRST. WE LIKE THE FUNCTIONALITY BUT ARE WE OVER PAYING FOR IT RIGHT IS THIS IS THE THEM OUT WORKING. AND AND WHAT KIND OF PROCESS WE HAVE IN PLACE TO BE SURE THAT. THE THE THE THE THE WORK THAT'S BEING DONE WE'RE NOT OVERPAYING FOR THAT AND AND BEING HAVE HAVING CONFIDENCE OF THAT. AS WELL. AND THE AC DO THINK AT JOE PROP HOPEFULLY LENDS ITSELF TO HOPEFULLY VERY BECAUSE INSTEAD OF HAVING A GIANT PROJECT QUARTERS ONLY LIKE TWO OR THREE THE AVENGERS WHO CAN ACTUALLY DO IT -- AND SO YOU ONLY HAVE MUCH OF A CHOICE TO SINCE YOU DIVE INTO THE POOL -- THAT HOPEFULLY THERE'S MORE OPPORTUNITIES WITH WITH BY BREAKING THINGS OUT THAT YOU ACTUALLY CAN GET MORE. COMPANIES WERE ABLE TO DID AND AND PARTICIPATE IN THE HAVE A BETTER COST EFFICIENCY BUT I'D. BUT PART OF IT IS IS THAT HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT. WE ARE GETTING -- HIM MAKING I GUESS PUTTING USERS TAXPAYER FUNDS. AGREED AND WE WE'RE HAVE TAKEN MANY STEPS TO TO ENSURE THAT THAT COMPETITIVE MARKET -- FOR THESE TYPES OF PROJECTS INCLUDING A PRE QUALIFIED VENDOR POOL -- AND LEVERAGE PROCUREMENT SO THAT WE WE KNOW THERE'S MORE TRANSPARENCY ATUALLY AND YOU KNOW WHAT THE COST OF THE WORK IS THAT'S BEING DONE. AND SO WHEN WE LOOK AT THIS YOU KNOW KIND OF AN ON AN ANNUAL BASIS IT'S OKAY WE WE PUT CAN PROJECT OUT WHAT THE COST IS AND WHAT IS THAT THAT RETURN ON INVESTMENT IS WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR AND WE CAN ALWAYS MONETIZE THAT BUT IT'S THE BUSINESS. VALUE. IN WITH -- WHAT ARE THE THE THE THE VALUE PROPOSITIONS THAT THAT A PROJECT IS PROPOSING TO ACCOMPLISH THEY WERE ABLE TO LOOK AT THAT AND REFLECT ON WAS WAS THAT ACCOMPLISHED? BEFORE WE MAKE ANOTHER INVESTMENT. SO I GUESS THOUGH ABOVE AS TO SERVE WRAP UP THIS PART -- SERVE MORE BROADLY. IN NINETEEN FEATURES WHAT THE LA A DANIELLE L.. I USED TO SENATE BUDGET SUB FOR WHERE WE DO A LOT OF BIG IT PROJECTS HERE WE'RE NOT USED TO DEALING AS MUCH AS OF THE HEARING WE'RE DEALING WITH A VARIETY PROJECTS BUT I DON'T KNOW WHETHER -- THERE'S A I WAS A REPORT BUT SOME SIR UPDATE FROM LA -- AND I'M NOT SURE IS IT THAT I SPECIFICALLY THE SUBCOMMITTEE BUT SORT OF SAYING OKAY THIS IS OUR CURRENT STATE AND WHAT WE SEE IN TERMS OF THE OVERSIGHT FUNCTION WHAT'S A LEGISLATORS FUNCTION TO BE SURE THAT WE ARE EXCITED. WITH THESE NEW PROCESSES FOR IT RIGHT AND AND WHAT ARE SOME THINGS WE SHOULD BE EXPLORING IN TERMS OF OUR PROCESSES IN OUR BUDGET SUB COMMITTEES AND SO FORTH OF THE INTERFACE. T. THAT PERHAPS -- MAYBE WE'LL GET ENOUGH EXPERIENCE BY NEXT BUDGET CYCLE OF LATE NEXT YEAR TO TO HAVE SOME SOME IDEAS -- SUGGESTIONS. MAYBE IT'S A REALLY AT BUDGET CHAIRED QUESTIONS IN THE END IN THE AND NOT MINE BUT I MEAN THE THE BUT DESPITE THOSE THAT IDEA -- I THANK YOU AGAIN I THINK THIS IS PART OF MY ADDITIONAL STATEMENT ABOUT KIND OF WERE IN THE EARLY STAGES OF VALUE WAITING HOW TO PROVIDE OVERSIGHT ENOUGH EFFECTIVE MANNER WITH THE NEW PROCESSES THAT ARE UNDER WAY. WE DID PUBLISH SOMETHING IN THIS BUDGET CYCLE REGARDING THE PROJECT APPROVAL LIFE CYCLE AND ITS ALIGNMENT WITH THE BUDGET PROCESS AS A WAY OF KIND OF STE FIRST KIND OF GOING INTO THIS KIND OF LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT -- PEACE AND TRYING TO UNCOVER YOU KNOW WHAT ARE THE BEST WAYS TO ALIGN THE EXISTING PROCESSES IN THE NEW PROCESSES THAT ARE COMING ONLINE -- WITH THE EXISTING PROCESS WE HAVE WITH THE LEGISLATURE LIKED BUDGET PROCESS AND SO I THINK AGAIN WERE WERE CONTINUING TO SEEM MORE PROJECTS MOVE TOWARDS AGILE WE'RE CONTINUING TO MONITOR THEM TO SEE WHETHER THEY'RE YOU KNOW MORE SUCCESSFUL THAN PRIOR PROJECTS HAVE BEEN -- USING THE METRICS THAT YOU KNOW WE'VE DISCUSSED LIKE COST AND SCHEDULE BUT CERTAINLY APPRECIATING BUSINESS VALUE -- AND I THINK WE'LL BE CERTAINLY INTERESTED IN IN SOMETHING LIKE A AN UPDATE A REPORT LATER ON ABOUT LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT OF THESE PROJECTS. YEAH I WAS I JUST IMAGINE THAT EACH OF US SUBCOMMITTEE CHAIRS WE HAVE OUR OWN LITTLE PIECE RIGHT WE'RE HAVING OUR PEACE HERE TODAY SERVICES FOR WILL HAVE THEIR P. SITES IN THE OF SOME OF THE OTHER BUDGETS OF COMMITTEES BUT THAT AGENCIES ARE OVERSEEING. AND DEPENDING IN THE ICE A LOT OF FAITH IN BY MY FELLOW BUDGET CHAIRS ARE PRETTY SMART PEOPLE BUT I'D THINKING ABOUT SOME CONSISTENCY ACROSS ALL OF US IN TERMS DEEPER USING SOME YEAH. SIMILAR PROCESSES AND SO FORTH. OKAY. ALL RIGHT IF THERE'S NOTHING ELSE ON THIS THEN LET'S MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER THREE SAUCE AND WE WILL REPEAT THE WHOLE DISCUSSION. SO THIS IS A BIG PROJECT. OKAY AND I GUESS WE'LL. SEE WHITE AUTOMATED WELFARE SYSTEM UPDATE. OKAY HELLO OF THE FIGURE OUT HOW WE IN A LOT OF PEOPLE HERE. I HAVE THE RIGHT. SOME RESTAURANTS THE AGENCY IN THE PRESENTATION OF WHAT. OKAY. YES SO WE HAVE -- WILL START OFF WITH THAT AGENCY PRESENTATION AND THEN WE HAVE A PANEL -- THIS AFTER AFTER AGENCY AND FINANCE IN LA -- SO -- WHAT WITH SAID JUST EVERYONE INTRODUCES THEMSELVES AROUND THE TABLE FOR THE WEEKEND WE'LL START WITH -- THE AGENCY AND GOOD AFTERNOONON TODD PLAN ASSISTANT DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES FOR AUTOMATION INTEGRITY INCLINE INITIATIVES. THANK YOU. CHRIS DUDLEY I'M THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR THE OFFICE OF SYSTEMS INTEGRATION OKAY ANY OTHER AGENCY FOLKS OKAY LA -- BRENT METZ GRAHAM. JANIE BELL LA -- FINANCE. HER WORDS FINANCE. OKAY AND I KNOW WE HAVE SEVERAL PEOPLE BE PRESENTING AS PART OF A THE PANEL SO WE JUST GO AHEAD HAVE YOU INTRODUCE YOURSELVES NOW BUT OF COURSE WE'LL GET TO YOU AFTER WE FINISH KEVIN AS THE NICOLE RICHIE CALIFORNIA WHAT FOR RIGHTS ORGANIZATION THANK YOU FOR INVITING US. THANK YOU. THANK YOU TRACY PATTERSON ON BEHALF OF THE ALLIANCE TO TRANSFORM CAL FRESH THANK YOU AND THE DOCTOR PAN IS JOHN DELAY I AM THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR CALLUSES I WILL TRANSITION TO BE THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR. FOR CAL SAWS LATER ON THIS SUMMER IT'S NICE TO BE BACK BEFORE THIS SUBCOMMITTEE LAST TIME I WAS HERE WAS THE DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE SYSTEMS INTEGRATION. SO IT'S GOOD TO BE BACK AND HAVE THIS DIALOGUE ON THIS IMPORTANT TOPIC. EXCELLENT ALL RIGHT SO WHEN WE GO AHEAD BEGIN WITH THE THE UPDATE ON SALAS. HI THIS IS CHRIS DUDLEY I WILL GIVE THE PROJECT UPDATE. SO ON THE COUNCIL'S PROJECT HAS STARTED WE RECEIVED ALL OF OUR FEDERAL APPROVALS IN FEBRUARY AND THE PROJECT KICKED OFF ON MARCH THE FOURTH OF THIS YEAR. SO WE HAD AN EARLIER STRATEGY MAY HAVE HEARD ABOUT WHERE WE WERE GOING TO MOVE FROM THREE SYSTEMS TO TO SYSTEMS AND THEN EVALUATE THE SINGLE SYSTEM. AND THAT WAS THE LRC FOR MIGRATION THAT WE TALKED ABOUT OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS OVER A YEAR AGO SAID WELL WE'D LIKE YOU TO PULL MORE TIME INTO PLANNING AND COME UP WITH THAT. FULL SINGLE SYSTEM STRATEGY SO AS YOU KNOW LAST YEAR WHEN WE WERE HERE WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THAT PLANNING EFFORT. PLANNING EFFORT WAS COMPLETED IN. DECEMBER AND WE SENT FORWARD ARE FEDERAL APPROVALS SO I HAVE PROVIDED A HANDOUT THAT SHOWS OUR ROAD MAP FOR CAL SONGS THAT ALL SPEAK TO TO SORT OF TELL WHAT THOUGHT APPROACHES. TOP LINE SHOWS THAT GOVERNMENT STRUCTURE -- THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THERE WILL BE A FIFTY EIGHT COUNTY GOVERNMENT STRUCTURE A GPA AND IT IS SCHEDULED TO BE IN PLACE BY JUNE. OF THE SUMMER. AND THEN THE SECOND LINE ON THIS IS THE ACTUAL DESIGN DEVELOPMENT CONVERSION IMPLEMENTATION LINE. SO THIS IS WHAT OUR OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS ALSO WERE CLEAR THAT THEY WANTED US TO LEVERAGE EXISTING TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENTS THAT WE'VE ALREADY MADE. SO LRS WILL BE THE BASE SYSTEM FOR CAL SAWS IT'S NOT A NEW BUILD IT STARTED TO SYSTEM THE ALERT SYSTEM WILL BE MODIFIED. SO VERY FIRST STEP IN THAT THE FIRST TRIANGLE IS THAT THERE'S A NEW HOSTING STRATEGY AND OTHER US WILL BE MOVED FROM AN ON PREMISES DATA CENTER INTO THE CLOUD. AND THEN AFTER THAT THERE WILL BE SEVEN RELEASES OF MODIFICATIONS INTO LRS THAT WILL TRANSFORM IT INTO THE CAL SAWS. APPLICATION THAT MEETS THE NEEDS OF ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES. AND THEN THE NEXT STEP IS THAT THE THIRTY NINE COUNTIES THIRTY NINE C. FOR COUNTIES WILL GO LIVE. ONE AND THEN AFTER THAT WILL BEGIN THE CAL NGUYEN. EMPLOYMENT TATIAN BEGINNING IN JANUARY TWENTY TWO AND THAT WILL BE A MORE WAVED IMPLEMENTATION IT HAS A DIFFERENT DATA STRUCTURE ODDS MORE CHANGE FOR THE COW WHEN COUNTIES THAN IT IS FOR THE SEE FOR COUNTIES. SO THEN IT WILL BE COMPLETE IN JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE WELL IN ADVANCE -- OF OUR FEDERAL DEADLINE FOR FUNDING OF TWELFTH DECEMBER. TWENTY TWENTY THREE THE OTHER LINES ON THE ROAD MAP REALLY JUST REFLECT OTHER PROCUREMENTS THAT WILL BE MADE TO SUPPORT. BOTH THE DEVELOPMENT AND THEN THE ON GOING -- MAINTENANCE OPERATIONS. I ATTACHED A SECOND PAGE THAT HAS THE OVERALL BUDGET -- AS OPPOSED TO THE PREVIOUS PROJECT WE DO HAVE AN OVERALL BUDGET THAT WAS APPROVED BUT THERE WILL LIKELY BE. ANNUAL UPDATES TO THAT AS WELL AS WE MOVE FORWARD AND LEARN MORE ABOUT THE NEEDS THAT NEED TO BE COMPLETED. THERE ANY QUESTIONS ALL RIGHT. OKAY LA -- IT'S FINANCE. QUESTION COULD BE MEMBERS OF THE PANEL. SO A ONE POINT. SIX BILLION. ALL RIGHT ICE ACTUALLY MAKE NOTE THAT -- WELL BEFORE STABILIZATION -- THAT WILL HAPPEN IF YOU'RE ON SCHEDULE THOUGH HAPPENED RIGHT AFTER A TERM OUT SO WE YOU INVITE ME TO THE RIBBON CUTTING FOR THE THAT COULD BE. AT THAT POINT WE'LL BE AN ELECTED OFFICIAL I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENS WHEN IN THAT CELL WILL BE THE SEA ITSELF. ALL RIGHT -- FANTASTIC ALL RIGHT -- SO WE DO HAVE A PANEL HERE. SO WE CAN HAVE OUR PANELISTS -- SEE THINK WE HAVE TO STARTING. TO GET BE ABLE TO ORDER YOU WANT TO GO IN OUR WILL WE CAN GO ON THE ORDER HAVE HERE SO WE'LL START WITH TRACI PATTERSON AND THEN FOLLOWED BY. A KEVIN US LAND AND FILE JOHN BLAZE SO. I ASK THAT YOU CAN TRY TO KEEP YOUR REMARKS TO THREE MINUTES MAX ALL THE IRAQIS THE TIME ALL THE TIME YOU DON'T WISH RIGHT THANK YOU WELCOME. THANK YOU SO YES I'M HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE ALLIANCE TO TRANSFORM CAL FRESH WE ARE A GROUP OF NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA WHO ADVOCATE ON BEHALF. OF OF PEOPLE WHO NEED AND USE CAL FRESHEN ALSO TO RAISE OUR CAL FRESH PARTICIPATION RATES I'M IN A EARLIER WE'RE TALKING ABOUT COST EFFECTIVENESS AND WHILE THE SAW SYSTEM SERVES MANY MORE PROGRAMS AND JUST HOW FRESH -- WITHIN CAL FRESH WE PAY THE MOST AND WE DON'T GET THE GREATEST RESULTS -- JUST IN JANUARY AISLES WERE FOR PROCEDURAL REASONS NOT REASONS OF INELIGIBILITY. AND SO CAL FRESH AND THESE OTHER STATE WHY PROGRAMS RELY REALLY HEAVILY ON AUTOMATION TO DELIVER SERVICES AND WE NEED AN EFFECTIVE SAWS IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO DELIVER THOSE SERVICES TO PEOPLE. AND IF YOU WANT TO BE CLEAR SOME OF YOUR EARLIER POINTS WERE TALKING ABOUT THE USERS WE REALLY CARE ABOUT AUTOMATION BECAUSE WE CARE ABOUT PEOPLE -- I'VE BEEN A RECIPIENT OF THESE PROGRAMS MYSELF I KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO BE ON THE END OF THAT PHONE AND FEEL REALLY DESPERATE AND SEEKING NEED -- AND SO WHEN I FIGHT FOR CAL FRESH IS BECAUSE I KNOW IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT AND WE CARE ABOUT AUTOMATION BECAUSE WE CARE ABOUT THAT HUMAN INTERACTION. AND YOU PROBABLY KNOW FROM BEING A DOCTOR BUT WHEN YOU INTRODUCE EMR AS AN SYSTEMS LIKE EPIC IT CAN REALLY CHANGE THAT HUMAN DYNAMIC AND WE'RE REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT THAT HUMAN DYNAMIC AND WHAT WORKERS GRIPS. AN OPTIONS MIGHT MEAN FOR FOR CLIENTS ACCESS -- AND SO AS A NEW GOVERNOR'S PRIORITIZING TECHNOLOGY AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ACES AND TRAUMA AND BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A SAWS THAT FACILITATES THAT AS WELL -- BECAUSE WE KNOW WHEN PEOPLE COME TO THESE ONLINE PORTALS OR MEET WITH WORKERS THEY'RE EXPERIENCING A LOT OF TRAUMA AND THE NEW SYSTEM THAT SERVES THEM WELL. AND SO WE'VE BEEN AN ACTIVE PARTICIPANT IN THE STAKEHOLDER GROUP THAT WAS ESTABLISHED THE TRAILER BILL LAST YEAR WE REALLY APPRECIATE THAT. I'M A THERE'D BEEN SOME REALLY POSITIVE OPENINGS IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS TO SOLIDIFY THE COMMITMENT TO MEET REGULARLY TO OPEN TRANSPARENCY AND WE EXPECT THAT COMMITMENT TO CONTINUE -- AND WE ALSO JUST REALLY WANT TO MAKE CLEAR THAT WE CARE ABOUT THE PROCESS AND PARTICIPATION FOR THE OUTCOMES WE DON'T WANT IT TO BE LIKE A CHECK BOX OF QUARTERLY MEETINGS ARE WE HAD A MEETING AND WE SAT THERE AND WE REVIEWED AN AGENDA WE WANTED TO ACTUALLY. TRANSFORM THE SYSTEM BECAUSE UNFORTUNATELY UNTIL NOW THE TECHNOLOGY HAS OFTEN BEEN A BARRIER NOT A FACILITATOR OF ACCESS AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE AS WE BUILD A SYSTEM FOR THE FUTURE THAT IT'S REALLY FACILITATING NOT -- AND SO TO THAT END WE REQUEST TRAILER BILL THAT WILL ESTABLISH THAT THE NEEDS OF CLIENTS AND APPLICANTS FOR A SYSTEM THAT MINIMIZES THE BURDEN OF THE OVERALL PROCESS TO ACTUALLY GET ROLLED NOT JUST AN APPLICATION OR RE CERTIFICATION BUT THE WHOLE PROCESS. THAT THAT WOULD BE HE NORTH STAR OF THE WHOLE PROJECT DEVELOPMENT AND SO WHILE THERE'S THIRTY TWO WORK GROUPS AND MONTHLY MEETINGS AND QUARTERLY MEETINGS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE IF WE ARE NOT THERE IN A ROOM TO CONSULT THE DECISION OR THERE'S A TECHNOLOGY BEING CHOSEN. THAT THAT WOULD BE THE GUIDING QUESTION IS THIS GOING TO MINIMIZE THE BURDEN FOR CLIENTS -- BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT COUNTY WORKERS AN ELIGIBILITY WORKERS ARE USERS OF THE SYSTEM WE WANT THE SYSTEM TO WORK WELL FOR THEM AND TO BE INTUITIVE -- BUT THE REAL END USER IS THE PERSON WHO EITHER GETS BENEFITS OR NOT. AND SO IF AN AUTOMATED QUESTION THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE MEANS THAT THIRTY DAYS LETTER THIRTY DAYS LATER YOU GET A LETTER THAT YOU LOST YOUR MEDICARE ALL. THAT'S THE REAL TRAGEDY AND SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE BUILDING A SYSTEM THAT CAN BE FIXED THAT CAN BE ENTERED OF THAT CAN RESPOND TO CLIENT FEEDBACK IN A CORPORATION THAT A THROUGH. DEVELOPMENT PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTATION [inaudible] THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING KEVIN OWNING. CALIFORNIA WHAT RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS THE CURRENT THOUGHTS HAS CAL WHEN WHICH IS A THING COUNTIES SEE. FOR PLEASE ENTER OUR SWITCHES ONE TONY WHAT THE EFFORT OVER HIS TO PUT HIM ALL IN ONE PLACE. THAT WAY WE DON'T HAVE TO SPEND. THREE TIMES FOR THE SAME CHANGE STORE CLEAN -- THESE WE WE'VE SEEN MANY DIFFERENT COMPUTER SYSTEMS COMMON GOAL. IN MOST OF THE TIMES THE MIGRATION THE START UPS HAVE BEEN A NIGHTMARE. FOR PUBLIC BENEFITS FISHERIES. THE SYSTEM IS NOT PROFESSIONALLY TESTED. BEFORE IT GOES LIVE WORKERS ARE NOT INDEPENDENTLY. VERIFIED THAT THEY'VE BEEN TRAINED PROPERLY. THE FISH WE SUFFER HOMELESSNESS. THE TH THE TUITION AND HUNGER. NGUYEN CAO NGUYEN WENT LIVE ABOUT TEN YEARS IN THE PREVIOUS CENTURY I THINK OR MAYBE TEN FIFTEEN YEARS AGO. ON A SATURDAY WE WENT DOWN THERE TO DO A MOCK INTERVIEW. AND I WAS DOING TO MOCK INTERVIEW AND THERE WAS A WORKER. THEY WENT THROUGH THE PROCESS AND THEY COULD NOT. PROCESS THE CASE WHAT THE WORKING. MONDAY THEY WENT LIVE. WHEN YOUR BANK CHANGES TOOK COMPUTER SYSTEMS NOBODY KNOWS ABOUT IT? IT ALL HAPPENED JUST PURE. IT'S PERFECT NOTHING HAPPENS WHY. BECAUSE WITH TALKING ABOUT MONEY BERMAN. THE CALIFORNIA'S GOVERNED BY FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES. AND HAS A BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF NINE PEOPLE FOUR OF THEM COME FROM LAYING -- DON'T KNOW THE CLICK BENEFICIALLY MEANINGFUL PARTICIPATION OF PROCESSES. TO MAKE SURE THAT HISTORY DOES NOT REPEAT ITSELF I WANNA MAKE SURE. THAT WE PUT THOSE. AND DOES NOT REPEAT ITSELF THE ABOUT THIRTY TWO WORK GROUPS MEETING REGULARLY. ABOUT IT AND POLICY ISSUES FOR CALIFORNICA IN THOSE THREE TO WORK WITH THE JUST MEETING FOR CALIFORNICA. AN EFFECTIVE JULY THERE'S GOING TO BE THE SAME WORK GROUPS ARE GONNA BE MEETING TO GET ARISE. CALIFORNICA WOMEN TO UNITE SO IT'S GONNA BE THE GONNA REPEAT THE WHOLE THING AGAIN. THE LEGISLATION. TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE COULD -- PROVIDE FOR ADVOCATES TO HAVE MEANINGFUL ENGAGEMENT. IN. AND IT HAS A MEAN IT'S BEEN A IT'S BEEN A STRUGGLE WITH WITH A CHALLENGE. THEY HAVE A NUMBER OF WORK GROUPS. HOMES THAT WE HAVE BEEN EXCLUDED FROM HOWEVER RECENTLY KELSO'S HAS AGREED -- TO DEAD -- HAS AGREED TO ADD ADVOCATE IMPROVED COMMUNICATIONS INVOLVEMENT. SUCH AS MONTHLY MEETINGS AND TO SHARE INFORMATION WITH US AND WE'RE VERY GRATEFUL FOR THAT. SO WE HAVE PROPOSED OF TRAILER BILL OR SUPPLEMENT REPORT LANGUAGE THAT WE WOULD LIKE YOU TO CONSIDER. AND WOULD BE GLAD TO MEET WITH THE DEPARTMENT. AND THE WIND CAL SAWS ABOUT THIS THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER PAN -- SINCE LAST YEAR WHEN -- THE LEGISLATURE PASSED THE TRAILER BILL FOR THE STAKEHOLDER COLLABORATION THE COUNTIES -- CW DA. EXCUSE ME -- THE SAUCE CONSORTIA THE STATE OF BEN ACTIVELY ENGAGE WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS WE'VE HOLD TO QUARTERLY -- STAKEHOLDER INVOLVEMENT MEETINGS -- WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS WE'VE HAD TO TOUCH POINT MEETINGS AND I THINK MORE IMPORTANTLY WE'VE ENGAGED IN SOME REALLY GOOD OFFLINE SMALLER GROUP DISCUSSIONS. THAT HAVE SORT OF HELPED US. MOVE AND BE ABLE -- TO LEARN FROM EACH OTHER -- BECAUSE WE CONCUR ON A LOT OF THE SAME THINGS A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT WE DO NOT WANT TO SEE OCCUR IN THE END AND IN THE FUTURE. WE UNDERSTAND THAT STAKEHOLDERS ARE -- FRUSTRATED AND THAT WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ENGAGE IN SOME OF THE DIALOGUE AND SOME OF THE COR APPLICATION FUNCTIONALITY. AND WE SHARE THAT FRUSTRATION. THE FEDERAL SHUTDOWN THAT HAPPENED AT THE END OF LAST YEAR AND AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS YEAR. DELAYED THE START OF THIS THIS PROJECT. TILL MARCH FOURTH SO WE JUST KICKED OFF THIS PROJECT THIS THIS MONTH AND AS SUCH WE'RE ABLE TO START TO SCHEDULE SOME VERY MEANINGFUL -- MEDIANS ON THE CORE FUNCTIONALITY OF PUBLIC FACING TECHNOLOGY ON A BRAND NEW PORTAL THAT WILL COME IN TO HAVE ONE PORTAL THAT OUR CUSTOMERS WILL INTERACT WITH. AS OUR A PLANE FOR BENEFITS AS THEIR MANAGING THEIR CASELOAD -- AND WE HAVE -- TO REALLY ALMOST HALF THE MEETINGS -- WITH HER STAKEHOLDER COMMUNITY TO REALLY DIG DOWN INTO THAT AS WE LOOK TO EVEN GET A VENDOR TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT. AND TO BE ABLE TO WORK THROUGH THAT SO THE REQUIREMENTS TO BE ABLE TO LOOK AT OUR DRAFT -- THREE REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL AND AS WE SECURE THAT VENDOR TO ACTUALLY PARTICIPATE IN THAT USER CENTERED DESIGN HELPING US FIND. THOSE PUBLIC MEMBERS TO PARTICIPATE IN THAT TESTING IN THAT DESIGNING GOING FOR TO WORK HAPPY. THAT THAT'S KICKED OFF WE ALSO UNDERSTAND HAS MISTRANSLATED AND MENTION -- THIS CONCERN ABOUT CONVERSION TRAINING THAT TRANSITION FROM ONE ONE SYSTEM TO ANOTHER SYSTEM IS ALWAYS A TIME OF HIGH ANGST AND HIGH RISK FOR THE RECIPIENTS FOR THE STATE. FOR THE COUNTIES AND WE KNOW THAT WE WANT TO ENGAGE IN THAT JUST KICKING OFF THE PROJECT THIS MONTH -- WE HAVE NOW SECURED OUR VENDORS WE ARE PINPOINTING THE TIME FRAMES TO ACTIVELY ENGAGE IN THOSE IMPORTANT DISCUSSIONS BECAUSE WE KNOW. IT IS ABOUT THE DATA AND THOSE TRANSITION AND AS WE START PREPARING THOSE PLANS. TO BE ABLE TO AVOID SOME OF THOSE THINGS THAT MAY HAVE HAPPENED BEFORE -- THAT WE WANT TO ENGAGE WITH OUR STAKEHOLDER COMMUNITY ON THOSE THINGS AND AND DO THAT WE'RE ALL ALIGNMENT FROM ACCOUNTING IS TO THE WORKERS. TO THE STATE INTO THE PROJECT THAT IS ABOUT AT THE DATA AND THE DATA TRANSITION AND PREPARING OUR USERS TO BE ABLE TO USE THIS SYSTEM A SYSTEM THAT ALREADY EXISTS TODAY AND THAT'S BEING MODIFIED TO BE ABLE TO WORK -- FOR THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES -- THE OTHER ITEM AS IT'S BEEN BROUGHT UP ABOUT THE WORK GROUPS ONE OF THESE THINGS IS THESE ARE LONGSTANDING WORK GROUPS THAT HAVE BEEN IN EXISTENCE SINCE TWO THOUSAND FIVE THEY'RE VERY. TECHNICAL AND TACTICAL THEY DO NOT MAKE POLICY THAT'S MADE BY THE STATE. AND WE NEED TO GIVE THAT LEVEL OF TRANSPARENCY WHAT'S GOING THROUGH THOSE THINGS AND AGAIN WE HAVE MONTHLY. MEETINGS THAT WE'VE NOW ESTABLISHED TO BE ABLE. TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR ADVOCATE STAKEHOLDERS HAVE THAT INFORMATION AND WE'RE ENGAGED IN THAT DIALOGUE. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND SO -- QUESTION SO I ACTUALLY. AND I'M CURIOUS A STRESS SIGN IN IN TERMS OF I KNOW THIS IS REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR TH CONCERNS THAT YOU PHRASE THE IF THE EXISTING SYSTEMS I MEAN THE THIS IS. MAINLY A PEOPLE PERSON ISSUE THE WORKER WHO'S INTO OURS THEIR UNDERLYING I MEAN TO DO THAT TO TELL YOU HEARING THAT. SOME SYSTEMS WORK BETTER THAN OTHERS IN TERMS OF TECHNOLOGY VERSUS THE PERSON IS ACTUALLY THE INTERFACE WITH THAT. IT'S BEST TO THE PROBLEMS WHEN THE SYSTEM GOES LIVE BEGINNING THIS PROJECT OKAY AT THREE YEARS IT'S IT'S OKAY TO THE TRANSITION PHASE IT'S NOT THIS. OKAY THE REASON FOR THAT IS THAT WORK WITH A SORT OF BEEN TRAINED AND THEY BID DAHLE BLOOD INTO A ROOM. AND A GIVEN A LITTLE SPEECH AND THEN THIS A GOLD WORK. AT THE LARGEST SUFFICIENT I MEAN AND TO ME BEFORE SOMEBODY GO THROUGH TERMINA IN THE BANK I'M SURE THIS TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING. OTHERWISE YOU'RE GONNA LOSE MONEY AND THEY SHOULD ADOPT THE SAME TYPE OF PROCESS IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WHOEVER'S ON THE TERMINAL. KNOWS WITH WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND THEIR MAKES MISTAKES THE MAN. FOR THE FIRST YOUTH IT'S CHAOS I MEAN I'M SORRY OKAY SO. AND AND AND THEN -- AND SO I REALLY FOR DANGER TAKING SEXUALLY THREE SYSTEMS AND TRYING. TO VERSION TOGETHER BUT TRYING TO BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER AROUND ONE SYSTEM AND WE JUST HAD THIS WHOLE CONVERSATION ABOUT ANOTHER SYSTEM IN TERMS OF MODULARITY AND SO FORTH I MEAN. IS THE WAY WERE PLANNING THIS BECAUSE WE DO HAVE WE ARE SIR TAKING PEOPLE FROM THREE EXISTING ARCHITECTURES AND TRYING TO BRING THEM TOGETHER. IS -- AT THE END OF THIS PROCESS TO IT MEANS IT IS EVER GOING TO HAVE AN ARCHITECTURES OF ABLE TO OF ALL OF OUR WE BECAUSE OF OF GIVEN WHAT WE'RE HAVING TO BUILD ON AND MAKES SENSE TO LEVERAGE OUR EXISTING SYSTEMS BUT I'M JUST. YEAH WE TALKED ABOUT AT CHILD IN THERE AND MODULAR APPROACH ISN'T SO OR IS THAT WHAT WE'RE GOING TO EVENTUALLY EVOLVED INTO WITH THIS APPROACH WITH THE IN THE FUTURE SINGLE SYSTEM ARE WE JUST LIKE OKAY WE'RE TRYING IGURE OUT ALL THESE THREE TOGETHER WHEN I HAVE SOME SINGLE. SYSTEM AT THE END OF IT BUT THN SOME POINT LATER WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO REBUILD THE WHOLE THING I JUST I I'M TRYING TO I'M TRYING. TO GET MY A ARMS. ARMS AROUND HOW. HOW THIS BEFORE WE GET TOWARD THE END OF THIS PROCESS WHICH WILL BE BEYOND MY TIME CELL WILL BE? SOMEBODY ELSE WILL HAVE TO FIGURE FIGURE OUT ABOUT IT WHEN IT FLOWS IF IT BLOWS UP I WAS A WIN BECAUSE WE HAVE A SUCCESS LIKE THE PROGRAM -- THAT -- THAT -- YOU KNOW HOW HOW. HOW DO I HOW HOW WE MAKE THIS WORK? LET ME LET ME GIVE SOME THOUGHTS ON THAT -- AND THEN AND THEN MAYBE MISTER RELATING IT YOU YEAH SOME TECHNICAL QUESTIONS -- TO SORT OF STEPPING BACK -- AGAIN THE ORIGINAL PLAN WAS THREE SYSTEMS TO TO SYSTEMS TO ONE FOR REALLY SIMPLIFYING AYE WE REALLY REPLACE THE NUMBER TO WITH THE WORD TEO THREE TWO ONE THAT IS WHAT WE ARE DOING NOW -- IT THAT THAT CAME AS A CHANGE IN THE CAME TO US FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN LATE TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN AND THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT A VERY. HARD DEADLINE OF BY THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE WE'RE NOT GOING TO THEY WERE NOT GOING TO PAY FOR ANOTHER SYSTEM SO. A TON OF PLANNING WENT INTO REALLY THINKING AHEAD TO WHAT THAT ULTIMATE SYSTEM SHOULD LOOK LINE. THINKING ABOUT CAL WHEN DOING USER LABS LOOKING AT ALL THREE SYSTEMS AND A LOT OF THAT HAPPENED IN SEVENTEEN AND MORE OF IT HAPPENED IN EIGHTEEN WE HIRE AN INDEPENDENT CONSULTANT -- MCKINSEY -- HELP WITH A LOT OF THAT WORK AND THAT WAS -- THEY WERE RESPECTED PARTNER AND APPRECIATED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PLAYED AN ENORMOUS ROLE IN THAT -- PLANNING PROCESS THEY WERE PART OF MANY MANY OF OUR MEETINGS HE OTHER BIG PIECE OF THE FEDERAL GUIDANCE THAT WAS WHAT YOU SAID THEY THEY DID NOT -- IT WASN'T A DESIGN THE VERY BEST SYSTEM FROM SCRATCH IT TO LEVERAGE THOSE EXISTING SYSTEMS AND THEY WERE LOOKING AT THE ENORMOUS INVESTMENT THAT WAS MADE AND WHAT WE CALL EL ARE ASKED THE LEADER REPLACEMENT SYSTEM LOS ANGELES THE SYSTEM. SO -- AND THERE ARE A LOT OF LESSONS LEARNED I THINK WHAT MR AS LANEY IN MENTIONED ABOUT SOME OF THOSE KIND OF ROUGH TRANSITIONS WHEN WE WENT WHEN CAL WENT WENT LIVE AGAINST ITS LEGACY SYSTEM. AND EVEN WITH ALL OUR ELSE -- NOT NOT NOT QUITE THE SAME THAT DAY BUT THERE WERE SOME REAL TRANSITION AND THERE ARE LESSONS LEARNED AND THOSE ARE ISSUES THE ADVOCATES OF REYES WITH US. AND REALLY NEXT MONTH WE'RE HOPING T KIND OF SEQUENCE A WHOLE SERIES OF REALLYIMPORTANT ADVOCATE CONCERNS AND FIGURE OUT WHEN DO THEY REALLY FIT IN THIS LIFE CYCLE. AS MR BLAME MENTIONED WERE MOVING VERY QUICKLY -- INTO ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PUBLIC FACING FACES AND THAT'S THAT'S THE PORTAL AND THE MOBILE OUT. AND ESSENTIALLY THERE WERE GOING TO BE ABLE TO BRING ADVOCATES A STAKEHOLDERS IN FROM THE BEGINNING BECAUSE THAT'S GOING TO BE A SEPARATE PROCUREMENT THEY CAN EVEN BE PART OF THE PROCUREMENT AND THE SETTING OF SOME OF THE REQUIREMENTS. AND WE'RE LOOKING REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT INPUT SO THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF A LOT OF PLANNING WORK HAD TO BE DONE UNDER THAT FEDERAL DEADLINE AND A LOT OF OUR INTERACTION WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS HAS BEEN CATCHING THEM UP AND SHARING THAT. AND REALLY NOW WE'RE REALLY EXCITED TO BE MOVING INTO A MORE ACTIVE PHASE OF GETTING THEIR MORE DIRECT INPUT ON THE ACTUAL THINGS AND THEN SEQUENCING IN LIKE I SAID EVERYTHING WE ALL THE CONCERNS THAT THEY REYES. THEY HAVE THE PLACE WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT THE MALL YET BUT WE WILL AND AND WE'LL WORK WITH THEM AND FIGURE OUT THE RIGHT TIME. I HOPE THAT ANSWERS SOME OF YOUR QUESTIONS -- SORT OF BUT I'M ALSO TRYING TO THINK ABOUT AND WHAT DO I GET BACK TO SOME OF THE INTERFACE ISSUES -- ESPECIALLY -- FOR THE BENEFICIARIES BUT IN TERMS OF SO AT THE END OF THIS PROCESS RIGHT AND AND THE UNDERSTAND SO GOVERNMENT WANTS YOU TO USE A MADE A HUGE INVESTMENT ON THIS UNDERLYING ARCHITECTURE FOR I GUESS IT'S L. R. S. RIGHT. IT SO WHEN WE END UP IN. WITH OUR UNIFIED SYSTEM IN. TWENTY TWENTY THREE I GUESS IT'S A GOOD SO WE ASK ABOUT THE QUESTION THE NATURE OF THAT SYSTEM AND IS IS A PLAN TO TRY TO GET IT TO A PLACE WHERE -- THIS IS WE WILL HAVE A NEED TO ADD FUNCTIONALITY ETCETERA IS THAT WE COULD SEE AN ARCHITECTURE THAT AS ACTUALLY PERHAPS MORE. FLEXIBLE AND I DON'T KNOW HOW I I JUST DON'T KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT LRS IT'S WAS WELL YOU KNOW WHAT GIVEN WHEN IT'S DEVELOPED AND WHAT'S LIKE BUT AND AND AND MAYBE ALSO. TECHNOLOGY CAN. CAN CAN COMMENT ABOUT YOUR INVOLVEMENT IN THIS AS WELL SO YEAH. A DOCTOR BALLOT THINK IT'S THAT IT'S A GOOD AND FAIR QUESTION. YOU'LL SEE THAT THE FIRST THING THAT -- DEPUTY DIRECTOR DUDLEY SPOKE ABOUT WAS THE MOVEMENT OF THE LRSD PLATFORM OFF OF AN ON PREMISES DATA CENTER TO A MODERN DATA CENTER -- WE ARE GOING TO THE A WS -- A CLOUD WE'RE GOING TO FIRST BRING UP PRODUCTION LOS ANGELES COUNTY WITHIN TWENTY NINETEEN TO THAT PRODUCTION -- CLOUD AN UPDATE THAT THAT GIVES US MORE FLEXIBILITY AND SOME MODERN COMPONENTS THAT WE CAN ENACT AS WE GO FORWARD. IT'S ALSO IN ORDER IF APPROACH TO BE ABLE TO SEE HIM PRODUCTION HOW THAT'S HOW THAT'S WORKING THERE ALSO LEVER LEVERAGING PROCUREMENTS THAT ARE ADMINISTERED BY THE DEARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY. AND CONTRACTS THAT THEY'VE PUT IN PLACE TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT. THAT PROVIDES US WITH A GOOD FOUNDATION SO THAT WE'RE ON A MODERN ARCHITECTURE. SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO DO IN ORDER TO SCALE TO FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES. IS RE ARCHITECTING SOME OF OUR NIGHTLY BATCH JOBS TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A MORE MODERN STREAMING ARCHITECTURE. TO COME TO A NEW -- REPORTS MECHANISM TO BE ABLE TO MINE DATA BATTERED FOR DEPARTMENTS USE IN THOSE TYPES OF THINGS THOSE THINGS HAVE BEEN AND ARE BEING BUILT INTO THE BUDGET AS WE O FORWARD. SO IT IS MORE MODULAR AND IT IS MORE -- MODERN AS WE GO FORWARD SO THAT WE DON'T IMPLEMENT A SYSTEM THAT IS OUTDATED FROM FIRST DAY BUT THE DIE HAS BEEN SET. BY OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS SAYING YOU WILL LEVERAGE LRS. IT WILL BE ACCOMMODATE THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES SO THERE IS A LOT OF FUNCTIONALITY ENHANCEMENTS. BUT WE HAVE TO MAKE IN ORDER TO SCALE FOR STATE IS LARGEST CALIFORNIA ARCHITECTURAL ENHANCEMENTS SO WE'RE NOT. IMPLEMENTING AN OUTDATED ARCHITECTURE WHEN WE GO LIVE. RIGHT IS HELPFUL. THE COMMENTS FROM TECHNOLOGY BUT YOU'RE INVOLVED IN THIS PROCESS AND SOME OPPORTUNITIES THERE. SO DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY -- WORKING WITH THE OFFICE OF SYSTEM INTEGRATION -- WE WE'VE BEEN MONITORING WE'VE BEEN -- WORKING WITH THEM TO GET THIS STATUS AS AS IT'S GONE THROUGH THIS FEDERAL APPROVAL PROCESS. AND AS MISPLACING HAS STATED IT IS IT WAS -- THE DECISION'S BEEN MADE BUT IT WASN'T MADE -- LIGHTLY I AM IN THE THE AMOUNT OF DISCOVERY THAT THAT WE HAVE WITNESSED GOING INTO THESE DECISIONS IMPROVING NOW THAT THAT THIS WOULD WORK -- WAS WAS VERY IN DEPTH BEFORE YOU'RE AT THAT THE STAGE YOU ARE TODAY -- IN ADDITION -- LEVERAGING YOU KNOW THE CONTRACT VEHICLES THAT DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY -- HAVE HAVE -- PUT OUT THERE -- IS A GREAT PARTNERSHIP FROM THE COUNTY CONSORTIA LEVEL TO THE STATE LEVEL SO THAT WE WE ARE SEEING THE SAME THINGS IN THESE MODERN -- ARCHITECTURES AND WE CAN YOU LEVERAGE THE LESSONS LEARNED -- FROM BOTH THE STATE AND THE COUNTY SIDE. AND A FREE **** ACTUALLY THE CLOUD THE SECOND PIECE THAT IS THAT SOMEONE ELSE IS A STATE OPERATED CLOUD. IT'S PUBLIC CLOUD EIGHT OF U. S. -- BUT THROUGH THE CONTRACTS THAT THE DEPARTMENT TECHNO QUE ALL RIGHT. THEN ONCE AS THE CLOUD THE CLOUD IS ACTUALLY PHYSICALS. CONNECTION IN THE US RIGHT AND YOU KNOW THERE'S IT'S SOMEONE ELSE'S SERVER SO CONFIDENTIALITY ALL THAT OTHER STUFF RIGHT SO. STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS HAS MADE SURE THAT THE SECURITY LEVELS ARE ARE SUFFICIENT FOR THE THE PROJECTS THAT ARE ALLOWED TO USE IT OKAY ALL RIGHT WELL I THINK THAT'S GONNA BE ROOM. FOR I MEAN. FOR MY COMES THAT TO THAT OKAY AND I I HEARD ABOUT THINGS LIKE MOBILE AND OTHER THINGS SO IN TERMS OF FEATURE WE HAVE THE APPROPRIATE INTERFACES FOR BOTH WHETHER STRICTLY WITH. THE VAN FISHERIES OR THROUGH TO CASE WORKERS -- WE HEARD TESTIMONY ABOUT -- ILL WITH. SOMEONE GO IT WILL BE DOING FOCUS GROUP TESTS ON THESE INTERFACES TO BE SURE THAT -- WITH CLIENTS THAT THEY THEY ACTUALLY THE QUESTIONS IN THE WAY THEY'RE PRESENTED AND SO FORTH MAKES SENSE IN THAT -- EASILY UNDERSTANDABLE AND I DON'T ABOUT LANGUAGES AS WELL GIVEN THAT THE INTERFACES -- THAT THE FOR THE SPEECH FOR THE INTERFACE IS THAT THE CLIENTS WHO ARE GOING TO SEE THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE FLANK THE ALL DIFFERENT LANGUAGES THAT PEOPLE CAN. DIRECTLY SEE. CASEY TO WHAT KIND OF WORK YOU'RE DOING TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN YES THE THE SHORT ANSWER IS IS IS YES TO THOSE WERE GOING TAKE BE ABLE TO DO THAT. AND NOW WE'RE GONNA WAKE WORK WITH OUR STAKEHOLDER COMMUNITY MAKE SURE THAT ALL THOSE REQUIREMENTS ARE IN THERE AS WE SECURE A VENDOR. AND TO BE ABLE BY IDENTIFY AND WORK WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS ON WHO ARE THE INDIVIDUALS TO BE INVOLVED IN THE DESIGN AND MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE FOCUS GROUPS AND PUBLIC GROUPS THAT WOULD BE ABLE TO USE THIS. AND LOOK AT THE USER INTERFACE OF THIS AND WORK THROUGH THAT AND MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S ROBUST TESTING. ONE SIX OF THE MOTHER -- I MEAN I THINK WE HAVE NOT I MEAN WE HAVEN'T SEEN THAT HAPPENED YET AND I THINK WE HAVEN'T SEEN IT HAPPEN YOU KNOW JUST LOOKING AT EL ARRESTED AS PEOPLE INTERACT WITH THE C. FOR ENOUGH SEE FOR YOURSELF. PORTAL IT IT'S NOT USER FRIENDLY RIGHT NOW AND WE COULD SHOW YOU SCREEN SHOTS OF IT IS EXTREMELY HARD TO NAVIGATE AND TO UNDERSTAND -- EVEN YOU KNOW WITH A MASTER'S DEGREE IN ALL THESE SORTS OF THINGS IT'S TRICKY -- AND SO I THINK WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT IS YOU KNOW CONTINUALLY GOING ON AND THAT ALSO IT'S IT'S NOT ONLY THOSE PORTALS AS YOU MENTIONED -- I THINK WITH THE VERIFICATION HOW PROJECT THAT WAS A REALLY IMPORTANT DECISION BECAUSE THESE WORK GROUPS ARE I. T. GROUPS. AND THEY DON'T SET POLICY BUT THEY IN TURN POLICY IN A WAY BY THE INTERACTIONS THAT THEY SCRIPT OUT AND SO WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT SOMETHING LIKE VERIFICATIONS YOU COULD HAVE POLICY ABOUT VERIFICATION. BUT YOU COULD SET A TONE IN THE QUESTIONS THAT A WORKER ASKS OR HOW THEY MOVE THROUGH THE PROCESS THAT EITHER OPENS IT UP TO SAY WE'RE GONNA PAYING EVERY OPTION POSSIBLE. OR CAN SAY THIS IS AMERICA VERIFICATION PRESENTED OR WERE DONE AND THOSE SORTS OF TECHNOLOGICAL SCRIPTS ACTUALLY GUIDE THAT HUMAN EXPERIENCE AND SO WE DO CARE A LOT ABOUT THE PORTAL ON THE WEBSITE. BUT WE'RE WE'RE JUST REALLY CONCERNED THAT I. T. DECISIONS THAT COULD SEEM LIKE YOUR I. T. DECISIONS. CAN HAVE AN IMPACT ON ON CLIENTS AND SO WHILE WE CAN'T BE THERE FOR EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE DECISIONS THAT'S WHY WE WANT THAT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S THE FOCUS OF THE PROJECT. OKAY DOES I NEEDED THAT. SO I THINK IT'S GONNA BE REALLY IMPORTANT THAT RESIDENTS I SAID BEFORE THE SUCCESS OF ANY I. T. PROJECT ACTUALLY IS USUALLY NOT THE I. T. ITSELF THE TECHNICAL GUYS CAN USUALLY FIGURE STUFF OUT BUT HE SAID THAT. THE DIET AND BASICALLY THE DELUDE DESIGNING THE UNDERLYING YELL DID YOU EAT. THE STUFF UNDER THE HOOD MAY WORK BUT THE ON THE STEERING WHEEL DOESN'T REALLY TURN THE BRAKES NEEDS A TOO MUCH PRESSURE SO FORTH AND THE VEHICLE DOESN'T WORK RIGHT FOR TO TO A PERSON HAS TO USE IT. SO -- SO HOPEFULLY HE SAID -- BUT THEN IT WILL IT ELKS GIVE IT YET AND SO -- IT'S A BIG BUDGET ITEM OBVIOUSLY Là IT'S VERY IMPORTANT SYSTEM BUT I HOPE THAT THEY'RE SUFFICIENT RESOURCES TO BE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE KIND OF WORK ON THE INTERFACES SHOES AND THAT'S WITH THE CLIENTS AND ALSO WITH THE PEOPLE AT THE USE THE SYSTEM. AND THAT AND SO THAT THEIR NOLLIE WELL TRAINED USES THE SYSTEM BUT EVEN ORE POORLY THE SYSTEM IS WORKS FOR THEM IS INTUITIVE -- FOR THEM AND FOR CLIENTS AND THAT ACTUALLY WE WANTED THAT THEY'D BE GOOD IF THERE'S ACTUALLY -- SINCE WE'RE TALKING TECHNOLOGY WHERE WE CAN ACTUALLY EMPOWER CLIENTS WITH THE SYSTEM TO GIVE THEM MORE INFORMATION FOR THEMSELVES SO THAT THEY CAN THAT THAT THEY CAN ACT ON INCIDENTS LIKE WONDERING WHAT'S THIS MYSTERIOUS BLACK BOX AND I HAVE TO ASK MY CASE WORKER AND ON A CASE WORKER. CAN TELL MYSELF I CAN LOOK UP STUFF. ABOUT MYSELF MY OWN IN THEIR OWN SYSTEM AT SOMETHING WE EXPECT MAULER OTHER SYSTEMS RIGHT WE GO TO HIM WE TOOK UPPER COUNTS ONLINE WITH ITS ADDRESS WE SHOULD HOPEFULLY. WE'RE ASKING THEM TO PROVIDE A LOT OF VERY PERSONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THEMSELVES SO THAT THEY CAN GET ACCESS SERVICES. THEY SHOULD ALSO GET. FEEDBACK THROUGH THE SYSTEM. IS TO NOT ONLY WHAT WHAT THE SYSTEM KNOWS ABOUT THEM BUT ALSO WHAT THE SYSTEM CAN DO FOR THEM AND NOT HAVE THE NECESSARY GO THROUGH OTHER PEOPLE TO FIND OUT IF WE CAN BUILD THAT KIND OF INTO THEIR BABY. THE CLOUDS OF SILS SEE VALUE IN OUR BASEMENT AS WELL. SO THAT [inaudible] OKAY [inaudible] ALL RIGHT. BOY I WAS GONNA TAKE QUESTIONS AT THE END BUT OKAY ALL RIGHT OKAY.
