BI ANNUAL RENEWAL INCREASE FOR

CURRENT FEE ON A BIANNUAL BASIS

00:14:09.315 --> 00:14:11.684
IS TWENTY DOLLARS THIS PROPOSAL

00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:13.118
WOULD MAKE IT SEVENTY DOLLARS.

00:14:13.185 --> 00:14:14.620
ALL NOTE THAT THE LAST INCREASE

00:14:14.687 --> 00:14:15.821
WE HAVE FOR OUR VESSEL

00:14:15.888 --> 00:14:17.890
REGISTRATION FEE WAS IN TWO

00:14:17.957 --> 00:14:18.691
THOUSAND FIVE ONLY INCREASED

00:14:18.757 --> 00:14:20.459
FROM TEN TO TWENTY ON A

00:14:20.526 --> 00:14:22.161
BIANNUAL BASIS. CURRENTLY

00:14:22.228 --> 00:14:23.095
CALIFORNIA'S VESSEL

00:14:23.162 --> 00:14:24.863
REGISTRATION FEE IS THE LOWEST

00:14:24.930 --> 00:14:26.565
IN THE NATION. WITH THIS

00:14:26.632 --> 00:14:28.801
PROPOSAL WE WOULD BE SIX LOS IN

00:14:28.867 --> 00:14:29.835
THE NATION SO IT'S STILL AN

00:14:29.902 --> 00:14:34.974
EXTREMELY- AFFORDABLE FEE- THE

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:37.509
DM B. IN ORDER TO DISAPPEAR

00:14:37.576 --> 00:14:39.178
THERE'S A THREE POINT TWO FIVE

00:14:39.245 --> 00:14:40.579
MILLION DOLLAR COST TO THE DMV

00:14:40.646 --> 00:14:43.082
FOR SYSTEM UPGRADES. WE EXPECT

00:14:43.148 --> 00:14:45.184
TO HAVE- THE SYSTEM UPGRADES IN

00:14:45.251 --> 00:14:47.786
PLACE TO BE RENEWALS BY

00:14:47.853 --> 00:14:49.255
DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST OF TWENTY

00:14:49.321 --> 00:14:52.091
TWENTY ONE. AND WITH THAT I

00:14:52.157 --> 00:14:53.692
WILL OPEN UP FOR QUESTIONS.

00:14:53.759 --> 00:14:55.928
BEFORE WE HEAR TO. HEAR FROM

00:14:55.995 --> 00:14:58.397
THE L. A. O. WHO- GENERALLY

00:14:58.464 --> 00:14:59.832
AGREES WITH THE GOVERNMENT'S OF

00:14:59.898 --> 00:15:02.501
PACKAGE THEY DO DISAGREE ON THE

00:15:02.568 --> 00:15:04.169
BEACH RESTORATION PROGRAM

00:15:04.236 --> 00:15:05.304
BECAUSE OF THE NEXUS THEY THINK

00:15:05.371 --> 00:15:07.606
THAT. BEACH GOERS AND LOCAL

00:15:07.673 --> 00:15:08.440
COMMUNITIES AND HOMEOWNERS

00:15:08.507 --> 00:15:10.609
WOULD BE A BETTER SOURCE TO PAY

00:15:10.676 --> 00:15:12.211
FOR THAT THAT SOURCE OF THAT

00:15:12.278 --> 00:15:14.613
FEE RATHER THAN THE BOATERS

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:18.651
AND- YOUR DEPARTMENT. SEEMS TO

00:15:18.717 --> 00:15:19.218
THINK DIFFERENTLY AND PARKS

00:15:19.285 --> 00:15:21.520
WISE THAT. WE ACTUALLY DID AN

00:15:21.587 --> 00:15:23.756
ANALYSIS A FEW YEARS AGO FOR A

00:15:23.822 --> 00:15:25.157
SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT THAT WAS

00:15:25.224 --> 00:15:27.426
PROVIDED TO ALEJO. WE DID FIND

00:15:27.493 --> 00:15:29.128
THAT THERE WAS A NEXUS ALBEIT

00:15:29.194 --> 00:15:32.264
NOT OF SUPER STRONG NEXUS BUT-

00:15:32.331 --> 00:15:34.633
THERE IS A CORRELATION BETWEEN

00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:37.736
MARINA BOTH ACTIVITIES AND BE A

00:15:37.803 --> 00:15:40.406
GENERATION OF FANS IN THOSE

00:15:40.472 --> 00:15:42.308
ARENAS- MOST OF THESE PROGRAMS

00:15:42.374 --> 00:15:43.542
THAT COME BACK EVERY PLACE TO

00:15:43.609 --> 00:15:45.444
STAND SO. THERE IS AN ENTIRE

00:15:45.511 --> 00:15:49.081
BECAUSE BY VOTERS- IN MARINAS

00:15:49.148 --> 00:15:50.616
OUT THE THIS PROGRAM SEEKS TO.

00:15:50.683 --> 00:15:52.451
MITIGATE THOSE IMPACTS AND THEN

00:15:52.518 --> 00:15:54.019
REPLENISH THE SPEECHES SO

00:15:54.086 --> 00:15:55.487
THAT'S THAT'S THE NEXUS THAT WE

00:15:55.554 --> 00:15:56.522
DRAW THERE'S MORE INFORMATION

00:15:56.588 --> 00:16:00.092
AVAILABLE. THE SUPPLEMENTAL

00:16:00.159 --> 00:16:00.726
REPORT WHICH WE CAN. CERTAINLY

00:16:00.793 --> 00:16:02.861
SURE THAT MANY. MICEX WHAT

00:16:02.928 --> 00:16:06.765
YOU'RE WHAT THE- GOOD MORNING.

00:16:06.832 --> 00:16:08.934
EARLY MORNING MEMBERS NICE TO

00:16:09.001 --> 00:16:11.270
SEE YOU OUT- YES RETAILERS WITH

00:16:11.337 --> 00:16:14.006
THE L. A. O. SO OVERALL WE

00:16:14.073 --> 00:16:14.873
THINK THAT THE GOVERNOR'S

00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:16.542
APPROACH HAS A LOT ABOUT IT

00:16:16.608 --> 00:16:17.976
THAT'S REASONABLE IT ADDRESSES

00:16:18.043 --> 00:16:19.278
THIS PROBLEM THAT NEEDS TO BE

00:16:19.345 --> 00:16:21.246
ADDRESSED IN THIS YEAR AND LESS

00:16:21.313 --> 00:16:22.514
YOU WANT TO HAVE MAJOR

00:16:22.581 --> 00:16:24.550
PROGRAMMATIC IMPACTS IT'S

00:16:24.616 --> 00:16:26.752
BALANCED IT HAS RAM REVENUE

00:16:26.819 --> 00:16:27.886
INCREASES AND EXPENDITURE

00:16:27.953 --> 00:16:29.421
REDUCTIONS WE THINK RAISING

00:16:29.488 --> 00:16:31.090
FEES IS REASONABLE BECAUSE THEY

00:16:31.156 --> 00:16:32.991
HAVEN'T BEEN RAISED IN SO LONG

00:16:33.058 --> 00:16:34.526
AND THE EXPENDITURE REDUCTIONS

00:16:34.593 --> 00:16:36.428
ARE PRETTY WELL TARGETED TO

00:16:36.495 --> 00:16:37.363
REALLY MINIMIZE PROGRAMMATIC

00:16:37.429 --> 00:16:39.365
IMPACTS. I THINK THE MAIN ISSUE

00:16:39.431 --> 00:16:40.866
IS THAT IT'S NOT PERMANENT IT

00:16:40.933 --> 00:16:42.301
RELIES ON SHORT TERM GENERAL

00:16:42.368 --> 00:16:46.071
FUND AND- THEN THEY WILL. HAVE

00:16:46.138 --> 00:16:47.172
TO COME BACK BEFORE YOU IN A

00:16:47.239 --> 00:16:48.874
FEW YEARS LOOKING AT ADDITIONAL

00:16:48.941 --> 00:16:50.409
CHANGES PROBABLY INVOLVING

00:16:50.476 --> 00:16:52.378
ADDITIONAL FEE INCREASES SO

00:16:52.444 --> 00:16:53.178
THAT COULD BE DIFFICULT FOR

00:16:53.245 --> 00:16:54.246
STAKEHOLDERS AND FOR THE

00:16:54.313 --> 00:16:55.914
LEGISLATURE TO REVISIT FEES

00:16:55.981 --> 00:16:57.950
AGAIN IN JUST A COUPLE OF YEARS

00:16:58.016 --> 00:16:59.852
SO I THINK ONE OF OUR

00:16:59.918 --> 00:17:01.286
SUGGESTIONS TO YOU IS TO

00:17:01.353 --> 00:17:02.654
CONSIDER WHETHER YOU MIGHT WANT

00:17:02.721 --> 00:17:04.356
TO PURSUE A MORE PERMANENT

00:17:04.423 --> 00:17:06.625
SOLUTION THIS YEAR SO OBVIOUSLY

00:17:06.692 --> 00:17:08.727
THE MOST PERMANENT SOLUTION

00:17:08.794 --> 00:17:10.596
WOULD BE TO REALLY ADOPT. A

00:17:10.662 --> 00:17:13.699
PACKAGE OF- GOING PERMANENT

00:17:13.766 --> 00:17:15.634
EXPENDITURE REDUCTIONS AND FEE

00:17:15.701 --> 00:17:17.436
INCREASES THAT- WOULD BE

00:17:17.503 --> 00:17:19.304
SUSTAINABLE BUT IT IS

00:17:19.371 --> 00:17:21.673
COMPLICATED- AS MR SHOPS MEANT

00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:23.876
NOTED AND ESPECIALLY IF YOU

00:17:23.942 --> 00:17:25.110
WANT TO LOOK AT RESTRUCTURING

00:17:25.177 --> 00:17:26.412
THE FEES AND WHO'S PAYING IF

00:17:26.478 --> 00:17:29.281
NON MOTORIZED BOTH PAIRS ME-

00:17:29.348 --> 00:17:31.583
BEGIN TO BE CHARGED AS WELL SO

00:17:31.650 --> 00:17:32.885
TO THE DEGREE THAT THAT IS TOO

00:17:32.951 --> 00:17:34.653
DIFFICULT TO DEVELOP THAT KIND

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:36.288
OF SOPHISTICATED PACKAGE OVER

00:17:36.355 --> 00:17:37.956
THE NEXT FEW MONTHS ANOTHER

00:17:38.023 --> 00:17:40.359
OPTION YOU COULD CONSIDER IS

00:17:40.426 --> 00:17:41.560
ADOPTING THE GOVERNOR'S

00:17:41.627 --> 00:17:43.796
PROPOSAL BUT ALSO ADOPTING A

00:17:43.862 --> 00:17:46.999
PACKAGE OF TRIGGER- INCREASES

00:17:47.065 --> 00:17:48.333
AND POTENTIALLY EXPENDITURE

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:50.102
REDUCTIONS AS WELL. THAT WOULD

00:17:50.169 --> 00:17:53.338
TAKE A FACT IN TWENTY TWENTY

00:17:53.405 --> 00:17:54.373
FOUR WHEN THE IN MINISTRATION

00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:56.842
IS M. ESTIMATING THAT THE THEIR

00:17:56.909 --> 00:17:57.576
THEIR SOLUTION WOULD KIND OF

00:17:57.643 --> 00:17:58.844
RUN OUT AND THEN FIND WOULD

00:17:58.911 --> 00:18:00.379
EXPERIENCE A SHORTFALL AGAIN

00:18:00.446 --> 00:18:01.447
AND NOW WE TO HAVE KIND OF A

00:18:01.513 --> 00:18:03.415
BACKSTOP YOU WOULD KNOW THAT

00:18:03.482 --> 00:18:04.416
YOU HAD A PERMANENT SOLUTION IN

00:18:04.483 --> 00:18:08.954
PLACE. BUT IT WOULD ALSO GIVE

00:18:09.021 --> 00:18:10.122
SOME IN TIME FOR THE ADMIN. OF

00:18:10.189 --> 00:18:10.722
STATE CALLED TO WORK OVER THE

00:18:10.789 --> 00:18:11.790
COUPLE OF YEARS DEVELOP AN

00:18:11.857 --> 00:18:14.426
ALTERNATIVE PERMANENT SOLUTION-

00:18:14.493 --> 00:18:15.461
THAT MAYBE THEY COULD BRING

00:18:15.527 --> 00:18:18.430
BEFORE YOU AND- MADE MAYBE MORE

00:18:18.497 --> 00:18:19.765
SATISFACTORY TO ALL PARTIES AND

00:18:19.832 --> 00:18:21.033
THEN YOU COULD ADOPT THAT BUT

00:18:21.099 --> 00:18:21.800
AT LEAST YOU WOULD HAVE SOME

00:18:21.867 --> 00:18:23.502
CONFIDENCE. THAT YOU HAD A

00:18:23.569 --> 00:18:24.937
PERMANENT SOLUTION IN PLACE TO

00:18:25.003 --> 00:18:27.372
THE DEGREE- THAT THAT THAT

00:18:27.439 --> 00:18:28.774
OTHER TYPE OF SOLUTION WOULDN'T

00:18:28.841 --> 00:18:29.775
DEVELOP AND YOU WOULDN'T BE

00:18:29.842 --> 00:18:32.611
KIND OF BACK IN THE EXACT SAME

00:18:32.678 --> 00:18:33.145
PLACE YOU ARE NOW IN A FEW

00:18:33.212 --> 00:18:35.814
YEARS. WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO

00:18:35.881 --> 00:18:36.548
PEOPLE THAT MAKE THE

00:18:36.615 --> 00:18:38.884
OBSERVATION THAT. ALL BOATS ARE

00:18:38.951 --> 00:18:40.752
NOT CREATED EQUAL. YOU KNOW

00:18:40.819 --> 00:18:42.855
THEY HAVE IT WITH A CAR YEAH I

00:18:42.921 --> 00:18:44.823
GOT A BEAUTIFUL TWO THOUSAND

00:18:44.890 --> 00:18:45.524
THREE CHRYSLER TOWN AND

00:18:45.591 --> 00:18:48.427
COUNTRY. I DON'T PAY A FEE THAT

00:18:48.494 --> 00:18:49.895
A BRAND NEW TESLA WOULD PAY

00:18:49.962 --> 00:18:51.897
WHAT WHAT WHAT IS WRONG IN THE

00:18:51.964 --> 00:18:53.799
WORLD THE VOTING OF HAVING SOME

00:18:53.866 --> 00:18:56.235
SORT OF. ATTENTION TO THE VALUE

00:18:56.301 --> 00:18:58.303
OF THE OF THE BOAT. WHEN YOU

00:18:58.370 --> 00:18:59.838
WERE IF WE'RE GOING TO. GIVE

00:18:59.905 --> 00:19:01.707
DMB THREE POINT THREE MILLION

00:19:01.773 --> 00:19:03.342
DOLLARS TO CHANGE YOUR SYSTEM

00:19:03.408 --> 00:19:07.312
WHY WOULD WE NOT. REALLY CHANGE

00:19:07.379 --> 00:19:07.913
THE SYSTEM GET SOME MONEY OUT

00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:10.749
OF THAT. YEAH I AM SURE THE

00:19:10.816 --> 00:19:11.683
DEPARTMENT'S GOT MORE

00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:13.652
INFORMATION ON ON THIS IS A BET

00:19:13.719 --> 00:19:14.486
I THINK ONE OF THE

00:19:14.553 --> 00:19:15.888
POSSIBILITIES AS MISTER CHAPMAN

00:19:15.954 --> 00:19:17.155
NOTED THAT THEY'RE CONSIDERING

00:19:17.222 --> 00:19:18.457
I THINK IS LOOKING AT THAT

00:19:18.524 --> 00:19:20.092
LENGTH OF THE BOAT. AS KIND OF

00:19:20.158 --> 00:19:23.462
A PROXY FOR THE VALUE- SO I

00:19:23.529 --> 00:19:24.496
THINK I THINK YOU DO HAVE

00:19:24.563 --> 00:19:25.764
OPTIONS TO LOOK AT MADAME MORE

00:19:25.831 --> 00:19:27.699
TIERED STRUCTURE BUT I'LL DEFER

00:19:27.766 --> 00:19:30.002
TO MISTER LAST MONTH. RIGHT SO

00:19:30.068 --> 00:19:31.870
WE ARE LOOKING AT A VESSEL.

00:19:31.937 --> 00:19:33.805
BEARD BASED- REGISTRATION

00:19:33.872 --> 00:19:37.509
SYSTEM. UNFORTUNATELY GETTING

00:19:37.576 --> 00:19:40.045
THE SYSTEM. OF THAT TYPE IN

00:19:40.112 --> 00:19:42.881
PLACE- ON THE SAME TIMELINE

00:19:42.948 --> 00:19:44.783
THAT THIS FUND IS GOING TO NEED

00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:46.184
ADDITIONAL REVENUES IT IS NOT

00:19:46.251 --> 00:19:47.653
FEASIBLE AT THIS TIME BUT IT IS

00:19:47.719 --> 00:19:49.354
SOMETHING WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON

00:19:49.421 --> 00:19:51.290
IT. I'M LOOKING AT. PARKING TO

00:19:51.356 --> 00:19:52.591
DMB ABOUT THE SYSTEM CHANGES

00:19:52.658 --> 00:19:54.660
THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED. AS I'M

00:19:54.726 --> 00:19:55.827
SURE YOU'RE FAMILIAR TìM BE

00:19:55.894 --> 00:19:58.630

00:19:58.697 --> 00:20:01.466
OF BEING UPGRADED AND- AND

00:20:01.533 --> 00:20:03.502
RECONFIGURED SO WE'D LIKE TO

00:20:03.569 --> 00:20:04.603
FIT IN WITH THOSE TIME LINES

00:20:04.670 --> 00:20:06.872
ON. ON TV SYSTEM RE

00:20:06.939 --> 00:20:08.240
CONFIGURATIONS AND THEN

00:20:08.307 --> 00:20:10.676
HOPEFULLY SHOULD- FOR A FUTURE

00:20:10.742 --> 00:20:12.010
CHANGE THAT SYSTEM THAT WOULD

00:20:12.077 --> 00:20:13.812
ACCOMMODATE- VESSELS OF A

00:20:13.879 --> 00:20:16.081

00:20:46.578 --> 00:20:50.282
TO- MISFIT THAT WILL FOR HIS

00:20:50.349 --> 00:20:51.750
PRESENTATION HERE TODAY A

00:20:51.817 --> 00:20:53.485
COUPLE THINGS NUMBER ONE ON THE

00:20:53.552 --> 00:20:55.454
BOAT FEE INCREASES 2210050%

00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:57.089
INCREASE. IN FIRST IN MANY

00:20:57.155 --> 00:20:59.091
YEARS ONE I WOULD LIKE TO BE TO

00:20:59.157 --> 00:21:00.659
GET YOUR THOUGHTS ON INDEXING

00:21:00.726 --> 00:21:02.194
SO WE'RE NOT HERE HAVING TO BE

00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:04.229
ABLE TO ADVANCE SUCH A LARGE

00:21:04.296 --> 00:21:06.531
POTENTIAL INCREASE. SECOND

00:21:06.598 --> 00:21:07.733
PIECES WHERE THE CHAIR WAS

00:21:07.799 --> 00:21:09.034
GOING NOW THIS IS SOMETHING YOU

00:21:09.101 --> 00:21:10.836
CAN BE LOOKING AT LONGER TRM

00:21:10.902 --> 00:21:12.671
BUT AT LOOKING AT WHAT THE

00:21:12.738 --> 00:21:15.807
CHAIR SAID IN A VERY JEALOUS IS

00:21:15.874 --> 00:21:16.375
TWO THOUSAND THREE CHRYSLER-

00:21:16.441 --> 00:21:19.444
BUT- BY TAKING A LOOK AT- VLF

00:21:19.511 --> 00:21:21.346
MODEL SO. THOSE WHO ARE

00:21:21.413 --> 00:21:22.714
RECREATIONAL BOATERS OUT

00:21:22.781 --> 00:21:24.583
FISHING IN A SMALL BOAT AREN'T

00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:26.652
PAYING NEARLY AS MUCH AS THOSE-

00:21:26.718 --> 00:21:28.020
SO. IF YOU WANNA TALK ABOUT

00:21:28.086 --> 00:21:29.821
BOTH THE 22% INCREASE POTENTIAL

00:21:29.888 --> 00:21:31.957
INDEXING. AND HOW FAR AWAY DO

00:21:32.024 --> 00:21:33.125
YOU THINK YOU REALLY ARE.

00:21:33.191 --> 00:21:35.060
RELATED TO IMPLEMENTING SOME

00:21:35.127 --> 00:21:39.931
TYPE OF. VLF MODEL FOR VOTE- SO

00:21:39.998 --> 00:21:41.967
ALTERED THE INDEXING PERSON I

00:21:42.034 --> 00:21:43.969
THINK THAT'S- A LAUDABLE

00:21:44.036 --> 00:21:45.837
APPROACH TO SOLVING THE ISSUE

00:21:45.904 --> 00:21:48.774
BUT I THINK. IT DOES LIMIT US

00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:50.275
IN THE NUMBER OF OPTIONS WE

00:21:50.342 --> 00:21:51.543
COULD COME BACK TO THIS

00:21:51.610 --> 00:21:53.912
COMMITTEE WITH. IF GIVEN SOME

00:21:53.979 --> 00:21:55.280
TIME TO ENGAGE OUR STAKEHOLDERS

00:21:55.347 --> 00:21:56.982
AND REALLY GET THEIR FEEDBACK.

00:21:57.049 --> 00:21:58.283
ON WHAT SYSTEM WORKS BEST FOR

00:21:58.350 --> 00:22:00.786
THAT SO. IF WE END ACCESS MY

00:22:00.852 --> 00:22:01.820
ASSUMPTION IS THAT WE'RE

00:22:01.887 --> 00:22:03.321
LOOKING AT ANOTHER INCREASE TO

00:22:03.388 --> 00:22:05.524
THE VESSEL REGISTRATION B. AS

00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:10.662
IS- IF WE CAN COME BACK WHICH I

00:22:10.729 --> 00:22:12.097
UNDERSTAND IS NOT. THE BEST

00:22:12.164 --> 00:22:14.299
APPROACH FOR A FEW REYES. IT

00:22:14.366 --> 00:22:15.667
WOULD GIVE US SOME TIME TO GET

00:22:15.734 --> 00:22:17.102
TO WORK WITH THE BOATING

00:22:17.169 --> 00:22:18.904
COMMUNITY UNDERSTANDS. ON A

00:22:18.970 --> 00:22:20.439
VESSEL TIERED REGISTRATION

00:22:20.505 --> 00:22:21.773
SYSTEM WHAT MAKES SENSE FOR

00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:23.575
THEM. WHAT MAKES SENSE FOR NON

00:22:23.642 --> 00:22:24.810
MOTORIZED BOATERS WHAT MAKES

00:22:24.876 --> 00:22:26.878
SENSE FOR CARDIGAN BASIS

00:22:26.945 --> 00:22:29.014
SPECIES COSTS. WE CAN HAVE THAT

00:22:29.081 --> 00:22:30.949
COMPREHENSIVE DISCUSSION AND

00:22:31.016 --> 00:22:31.883
THEN I THINK COME BACK WITH A

00:22:31.950 --> 00:22:34.453
MORE EQUITABLE SOLUTION FOR THE

00:22:34.519 --> 00:22:36.955
LONG TERM- HOWEVER YOU KNOW

00:22:37.022 --> 00:22:38.223
THERE IS THERE'S A BENEFIT TO

00:22:38.290 --> 00:22:39.958
INDUCTION AS WELL I'M HAVING AN

00:22:40.025 --> 00:22:41.426
AUTOMATIC TRIGGER INSTEAD SHE

00:22:41.493 --> 00:22:43.095
TO DO THAT. BUT IT DOES

00:22:43.161 --> 00:22:44.062
ALLEVIATE A LOT OF THIS THE

00:22:44.129 --> 00:22:48.533
STRESS OF. HAVING TO POSE

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:50.135
ADDITIONAL FEES- ON THE TWO

00:22:50.202 --> 00:22:51.770
HUNDRED FIFTY PERCENT- YOU

00:22:51.837 --> 00:22:54.072
KNOW. WHEN WE LOOK AT YOU KNOW

00:22:54.139 --> 00:22:55.707
ON A PERCENTAGE BASIS THAT IS.

00:22:55.774 --> 00:22:57.075
IT'S A HIGH NUMBER WE

00:22:57.142 --> 00:22:59.578
UNDERSTAND THAT BUT I. THINK I

00:22:59.644 --> 00:23:02.447
MENTIONED WHAT I- WHAT I NOTED

00:23:02.514 --> 00:23:03.515
IN MY EARLIER TESTIMONY IS

00:23:03.582 --> 00:23:05.650
THAT. EARLY CALIFORNIA'S LOS

00:23:05.717 --> 00:23:07.586
NATION AT TEN DOLLARS. WE'RE

00:23:07.652 --> 00:23:08.920
GOING TO THIRTY FIVE DOLLARS

00:23:08.987 --> 00:23:10.422
AND THAT'S GONNA BE THE SIX LOS

00:23:10.489 --> 00:23:13.058
IN THE NATION SO. THIRDLY WE

00:23:13.125 --> 00:23:14.559
OFFER A LOT OF PROGRAMS OR

00:23:14.626 --> 00:23:16.394
DIVISION OF LIVING WATER WAYS-

00:23:16.461 --> 00:23:18.230
AND THAT FEE IS STILL.

00:23:18.296 --> 00:23:21.333
EXTREMELY LOW- SO WE'VE GOT

00:23:21.399 --> 00:23:22.200
SOME GENERAL FUND IN THIS

00:23:22.267 --> 00:23:23.835
PACKAGE TO ALLEVIATE THE AMOUNT

00:23:23.902 --> 00:23:24.936
OF THE FEE INCREASE WE'RE

00:23:25.003 --> 00:23:25.737
LOOKING AT REDUCTIONS WERE

00:23:25.804 --> 00:23:27.739
BOUNCING. PRIORITY FOR US IS TO

00:23:27.806 --> 00:23:30.175
KEEP THAT BE AS LOW AS

00:23:30.242 --> 00:23:32.344
POSSIBLE- HOWEVER. WITH ANY

00:23:32.410 --> 00:23:33.812
TIME YOU SAW IN A STRUCTURAL

00:23:33.879 --> 00:23:35.147
DEFICIENCY IN A FUNDS YOU'VE

00:23:35.213 --> 00:23:35.981
YOU'VE ONLY GOT A LIMITED

00:23:36.047 --> 00:23:37.482
NUMBER ABOUT COMES WITH WITH

00:23:37.549 --> 00:23:40.085
THE MATH TO GET THERE SO- AND

00:23:40.152 --> 00:23:41.186
THEN IF YOU CAN I THINK THERE

00:23:41.253 --> 00:23:42.387
WAS A THIRD QUESTION BUT I'M-

00:23:42.454 --> 00:23:43.555
BUT I'M NOT RECALLING WHAT.

00:23:43.622 --> 00:23:45.157
WITHOUT WHAT'S I'M GOOD I KNOW

00:23:45.223 --> 00:23:46.525
THAT WERE LIMITED IN TIME BUT I

00:23:46.591 --> 00:23:47.859
APPRECIATE THAT MY LAST PIECE

00:23:47.926 --> 00:23:50.061
IS TWENTY SECONDS IS. I

00:23:50.128 --> 00:23:51.530
UNDERSTAND THAT YOU WANT TO BE

00:23:51.596 --> 00:23:51.997

00:23:52.063 --> 00:23:54.065
COMMUNITY AND ANYTIME WE SEE

00:23:54.132 --> 00:23:55.901
THESE LARGE- INCREASES AT THE

00:23:55.967 --> 00:23:57.435
CONSISTENCY IS GOING TO BE THE

00:23:57.502 --> 00:23:59.304
BEST WAY TO APPROACH. WHEN IT

00:23:59.371 --> 00:24:00.639
COMES THE FEES BUT I REALLY

00:24:00.705 --> 00:24:02.207
APPRECIATE MISTRETTA IN THANK

PRESENTATION. A CENTER TOLLEY.

00:24:06.578 --> 00:24:09.815
SO BUT. SO- I'M CONCERNED ABOUT

00:24:09.881 --> 00:24:13.885
THAT. I GUESS HOW DO WE KNOW

00:24:13.952 --> 00:24:14.786
THAT THE BOATS ARE ACTUALLY

00:24:14.853 --> 00:24:15.954
CAUSING THE EROSION AND WE'RE

00:24:16.021 --> 00:24:18.156
NOT JUST HAVING OTHER TYPES OF

00:24:18.223 --> 00:24:18.890
THE RELIGION THAT NOW WE'RE

00:24:18.957 --> 00:24:20.458
GONNA SETTLE. A BOAT OWNERS

00:24:20.525 --> 00:24:25.197
WITH. SO ON THE POLE BEACH

RESTORATION FUND TRANSFERS.

00:24:27.165 --> 00:24:28.700
THIS PROPOSAL RECOMMENDS

00:24:28.767 --> 00:24:31.469
SUSPENDING MOST TRANSFERS- I

00:24:31.536 --> 00:24:33.505
THINK FOR SOME REASON HAS THAT

00:24:33.572 --> 00:24:35.106
BEEN POINTED OUT TO DATE WHICH

00:24:35.173 --> 00:24:37.275
IS. THAT NEXUS BETWEEN BEACH

00:24:37.342 --> 00:24:40.879
EROSION. AND BOATERS IS NOT AS

00:24:40.946 --> 00:24:42.547
STRONG WERE RELEVANT TO THE

00:24:42.614 --> 00:24:44.216
PROGRAMS THAT VOTERS WANT AS

00:24:44.282 --> 00:24:46.084
PUTTING THE NEW BOTH THE LAUNCH

00:24:49.421 --> 00:24:50.722
WE'VE DONE THIS PROPOSAL WE

00:24:50.789 --> 00:24:51.890
REALLY LOOKED AT WATER WHAT ARE

00:24:51.957 --> 00:24:53.091
THE PROGRAMS THAT WE DELIVER

00:24:53.158 --> 00:24:54.492
THROUGH TV W. TO HELP THE

00:24:54.559 --> 00:24:55.861
STRONGEST CORRELATION WITH

00:24:55.927 --> 00:24:57.429
VOTERS IF WE'RE GOING TO RAISE

00:24:57.495 --> 00:24:59.631
THE FEE. LET'S MAKE SURE THAT

00:24:59.698 --> 00:25:00.532
WE'RE LOOKING AT ALL THE

00:25:00.599 --> 00:25:02.500
PROGRAMS BALLISTICALLY. AND

00:25:02.567 --> 00:25:04.002
RAISING FEES FOR THE PROGRAMS

00:25:04.069 --> 00:25:05.871
THAT THAT THAT VOTERS REALLY

00:25:05.937 --> 00:25:11.610
BENEFIT FROM SO. WALL THERE'S A-

00:25:11.676 --> 00:25:13.245
THE NEXUS TO THE TO. GREENERY

00:25:13.311 --> 00:25:17.349
AND VOTING- I BELIEVE NOT VOTE

00:25:17.415 --> 00:25:19.084
RATE PLAN WITH INITIATED TO THE

00:25:19.150 --> 00:25:21.186
FOUR. IT WAS. ABOUT FINDING A

00:25:21.253 --> 00:25:23.855
PROGRAM WITHOUT NECESSARILY A

00:25:23.922 --> 00:25:25.223
FUNDING SOURCE PERSONAL

00:25:25.290 --> 00:25:26.725
WATERCRAFT WAS A FIND THAT

00:25:26.791 --> 00:25:28.860
COULD DO. BUT THOSE REVENUE

00:25:28.927 --> 00:25:30.528
TRANSFERS AND WAS DEEMED

00:25:30.595 --> 00:25:32.931
APPROPRIATE- BUT BUT IN THIS

00:25:32.998 --> 00:25:34.299
PROPOSAL WE DO ACTUALLY

00:25:34.366 --> 00:25:37.602
RECOMMEND SUSPENDING. THE

00:25:37.669 --> 00:25:38.169
TRANSFER STOOD UP FOR THOSE

00:25:38.236 --> 00:25:40.872
REASONS. OKAY WE'LL TAKE WE'RE

00:25:40.939 --> 00:25:42.274
GOING TO KEEP THE MATTER OPEN

00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:43.642
AND WE'RE GONNA COME BACK THE

00:25:43.708 --> 00:25:44.876
OTHER THING THAT THE STAFF

00:25:44.943 --> 00:25:46.845
WOULD LIKE IS ON THE INVASIVE

00:25:46.912 --> 00:25:49.281
SPECIES- PROGRAMS AND ALL THAT

00:25:49.347 --> 00:25:51.082
IF WE CAN GET SOME INFORMATION

00:25:51.149 --> 00:25:52.550
ON. THE CONTRIBUTION TO

00:25:52.617 --> 00:25:55.086
COMMERCIAL. LICENSE VOTERS MAKE

00:25:55.153 --> 00:25:56.621
THEM AND WE GET THIS IDEA THAT

00:25:56.688 --> 00:25:58.189
THAT FOREIGN BOATS ARE COMING

00:25:58.256 --> 00:25:59.925
IN- THEY'RE TALKING AND THEY'RE

00:25:59.991 --> 00:26:01.559
BRINGING AN INVASIVE SPECIES

00:26:01.626 --> 00:26:03.194
WHAT ARE THE FEES THAT THEY PAY

00:26:03.261 --> 00:26:04.629
SO THIS THE COMMITTEE HAS A

00:26:04.696 --> 00:26:08.266
BETTER. IDEA OF A- HOW TO.

00:26:08.333 --> 00:26:10.669
DIVIDE THAT UP. AND WITH THAT

00:26:10.735 --> 00:26:12.637
WE WILL HOLD THE MATTER THIS IS

00:26:12.704 --> 00:26:13.171

ONE OF THE SPECIFIC CAPITAL

00:35:57.755 --> 00:35:59.156
OUTLAY PROPOSALS ARE ONES THAT

00:35:59.223 --> 00:36:00.992
ARE REASONABLE GIVEN THE AGE OF

THE FACILITIES MOST OF THEM ARE

00:36:02.827 --> 00:36:04.762
SIXTY OR MORE YEARS OLD- AND

00:36:04.829 --> 00:36:05.730

COST- THE- THE OUT YOUR COST OF

00:36:14.071 --> 00:36:15.139
THESE PROJECTS WHILE THE-

00:36:15.206 --> 00:36:17.742
PROPOSAL- INCLUDED TOTAL FIFTY

00:36:17.808 --> 00:36:19.176
FOUR MILLION DOLLARS. FROM THE

GENERAL FUND IN THE BUDGET YEAR

00:36:20.845 --> 00:36:22.013
THAT'S MOSTLY FOR PLANNING AN

00:36:22.079 --> 00:36:24.515
ACQUISITION AND OF COURSE- THE

00:36:24.582 --> 00:36:26.217
CONSTRUCTION PHASE OF EACH OF

00:36:26.284 --> 00:36:27.818
THESE PROJECTS IS THE MORE

00:36:27.885 --> 00:36:29.820
EXPENSIVE COMPONENT AND THOSE

00:36:29.887 --> 00:36:31.355
WILL BE IN OUT YEARS AND

00:36:31.422 --> 00:36:32.690
CURRENT ESTIMATES ARE THAT

00:36:32.757 --> 00:36:35.126
TOTAL. COSTS FOR THESE PROJECTS

00:36:35.192 --> 00:36:37.028
IS GONNA BE OVER HALF A BILLION

00:36:37.094 --> 00:36:38.062
DOLLARS SIX HUNDRED FIFTY FOUR

00:36:38.129 --> 00:36:41.432
MILLION. ON AT LEAST ON CURRENT

00:36:41.499 --> 00:36:42.300
ESTIMATES AND- NORMALLY WE

00:36:42.366 --> 00:36:43.935
WOULD THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO

00:36:44.001 --> 00:36:44.936
AND WE DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

00:36:45.002 --> 00:36:47.338
TO. MAINTAIN AND REPLACE OLDER

00:36:47.405 --> 00:36:49.240
FACILITIES BUT THE CHALLENGE

00:36:49.307 --> 00:36:51.375
THAT YOU FACE IS BOTH OUR

00:36:51.442 --> 00:36:52.443
OFFICE AND DEPARTMENT FINANCES

DEFICITS IN THE GENERAL FUND

00:36:56.047 --> 00:36:57.148
AND SO WE THINK IT'S SIMPLY

00:36:57.214 --> 00:36:59.750
IMPORTANT THAT WITH- MAGNITUDE.

00:36:59.817 --> 00:37:03.654
OF MAGNITUDE OF IMPORTANT

00:37:03.721 --> 00:37:06.457
ENSURE THAT THE OUT YOUR COST

00:37:06.524 --> 00:37:08.092
FOR ONE TO STAY IN YOUR LONGER

00:37:08.159 --> 00:37:13.531
TERM GENERAL FUND PLAN. SEE MR

00:37:13.598 --> 00:37:15.299
FAVREAU I'M I KNOW THE PART OF

00:37:15.366 --> 00:37:17.868
THE- AFTER THE CONSTRUCTION A

00:37:17.935 --> 00:37:19.971
LOT OF THESE PROJECTS INCLUDE

00:37:20.037 --> 00:37:22.673
DEMOLITION AND I KNOW THEY DID

00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:24.141
THE EVE YOU'VE GIVEN US ARE

00:37:24.208 --> 00:37:25.776
THREE CATEGORIES ON ON THIS

00:37:25.843 --> 00:37:27.678
STRATEGIC FIREFIGHTING BUT I

00:37:27.745 --> 00:37:28.946
WANT TO FLIP OVER TO THE

00:37:29.013 --> 00:37:31.382
FORESTRY SIDE ANY IDEA THAT

00:37:31.449 --> 00:37:33.784
THAT. WE'RE LOOKING TO GET MORE

00:37:33.851 --> 00:37:36.654
FORSTER'S UP ENOUGH UP IN THE

00:37:36.721 --> 00:37:38.089
AREA ARE ANY OF THESE

00:37:38.155 --> 00:37:40.524
FACILITIES POSSIBLE TO BE

00:37:40.591 --> 00:37:42.526
RETROFITTED OR PROVIDE SOME

00:37:42.593 --> 00:37:44.562
SORT OF SERVICES THAT THE THAT

00:37:44.629 --> 00:37:46.831
THE FORESTERS WOULD BE EITHER

00:37:46.897 --> 00:37:49.300
NOT FOR OUR EMERGENCY

00:37:49.367 --> 00:37:50.868
FACILITIES FOR YOU KNOW A

00:37:50.935 --> 00:37:52.803
HELIPAD AND ALL THAT THE KISS

00:37:52.870 --> 00:37:53.938
OTHER STRUCTURES BECAUSE WE'VE

00:37:54.005 --> 00:37:55.406
LOOKED AT THE YOU'VE GOT SOME

00:37:55.473 --> 00:37:57.475
PROJECTS WHERE WE HAVE. THE

00:37:57.541 --> 00:37:59.477
FORMER INCARCERATED WE'RE GOING

00:37:59.543 --> 00:38:01.278
TO CONVERT IT TO A USE IN THE

00:38:01.345 --> 00:38:05.216
CCC'S GOT SOME OTHERS THERE'S

00:38:05.282 --> 00:38:06.317
JUST A MULTI USE FOR STATE. FOR

00:38:06.384 --> 00:38:10.221
THIS- THAT. THE I GUESS THE-

00:38:10.287 --> 00:38:12.189
VEGETATION MANAGEMENT PORTION

00:38:12.256 --> 00:38:18.229
OF YOUR WORK. SO WE WOULD

00:38:18.295 --> 00:38:19.397
OBVIOUSLY IF THERE'S A

00:38:19.463 --> 00:38:20.631
POSSIBILITY OF THE ARE YOU

00:38:20.698 --> 00:38:21.766
TALKING ABOUT LIKE READ

00:38:21.832 --> 00:38:23.367
REPURPOSE SAYING A DISABILITY

00:38:23.434 --> 00:38:27.571
THAT WE WOULD CORRECTIVE LEAVE-

00:38:27.638 --> 00:38:28.606
YEAH I MEAN I BELIEVE WE COULD

00:38:28.673 --> 00:38:30.508
LOOK AT THOSE THOSE FACILITIES

00:38:30.574 --> 00:38:38.849
IF WE ARE LEAVING A- THAT-

00:38:38.916 --> 00:38:39.784
WHETHER THAT FACILITY MIGHT

00:38:39.850 --> 00:38:41.719
WORK- IT IT DOES DEPEND ON A

00:38:41.786 --> 00:38:43.354
NUMBER OF FACTORS AS FAR AS

00:38:43.421 --> 00:38:44.221
WHAT LOCATION WHERE THE

00:38:44.288 --> 00:38:48.192
FACILITY IS IN RELATION TO. TO

00:38:48.259 --> 00:38:49.226
THE S. R. A. WHERE WE WOULD BE

00:38:49.293 --> 00:38:51.228
DOING THE WORK- THERE ARE SOME

00:38:51.295 --> 00:38:53.731
EXAMPLES OF FACILITIES IN IN

00:38:53.798 --> 00:38:56.167
THIS- LOWS A WE'RE WE'RE

00:38:56.233 --> 00:38:58.469
LOOKING AT RELOCATION- IN IN

00:38:58.536 --> 00:38:59.970
LARGE PART BECAUSE THOSE

00:39:00.037 --> 00:39:00.604
FACILITIES ARE NOW IN THE

00:39:00.671 --> 00:39:03.541
MIDDLE OF A- OF AN URBAN AREA-

00:39:03.607 --> 00:39:06.043
WHERE. FORTY FIFTY SIXTY YEARS

00:39:06.110 --> 00:39:08.345
AGO THEY WEREN'T THEY WERE THEY

00:39:08.412 --> 00:39:10.781
WERE MORE REALLY- ADJACENT TO

00:39:10.848 --> 00:39:15.553
THE S. R. A. AND SO WERE. WERE

00:39:15.619 --> 00:39:16.787
OPERATIONALLY EFFICIENT WHERE

00:39:16.854 --> 00:39:18.122
THEY WERE LOCATED AND NOW WE

00:39:18.189 --> 00:39:19.924
ARE WE ARE FINDING THAT SOME OF

00:39:19.990 --> 00:39:21.225
THE STATIONS ARE NOW MORE IN AN

00:39:21.292 --> 00:39:23.160
URBAN AREA WHERE WHERE ACCESS

00:39:23.227 --> 00:39:27.765
IS MORE DIFFICULT AND- SO I

00:39:27.832 --> 00:39:28.699
GUESS MY ANSWER IS IT WOULD BE

00:39:28.766 --> 00:39:30.701
IT WOULD DEPEND ON THE SPECIFIC

00:39:30.768 --> 00:39:33.170
FACILITY BUT I THINK WE WOULD-

00:39:33.237 --> 00:39:35.506
WE WOULD CERTAINLY LOOK AT. AT-

00:39:35.573 --> 00:39:37.508
AND THAT IS A POSSIBILITY IF IT

00:39:37.575 --> 00:39:39.343
WERE A- WE CAN DO THAT. ALL

00:39:39.410 --> 00:39:42.012
RIGHT I'M WILL BE IN CONTACT

00:39:42.079 --> 00:39:44.915
CENTRE DOLLY. THANK YOU A

00:39:44.982 --> 00:39:47.351
RESERVE A COMMENT MAINLY I I'LL

00:39:47.418 --> 00:39:48.986
I GREW UP A MILE AND HALF FROM

00:39:49.053 --> 00:39:50.087
THE INTERMOUNTAIN CAMP WHICH IS

00:39:50.154 --> 00:39:52.590
ONE THAT YOU'RE GOING TO-

00:39:52.656 --> 00:39:54.391
REPURPOSE AND WE JUST

00:39:54.458 --> 00:39:56.260
DESPERATELY NEED. THESE

00:39:56.327 --> 00:39:58.262
PROJECTS TO GO FORWARD IN A

00:39:58.329 --> 00:39:58.863
MORE TIMELY MANNER IN MY MIND

00:39:58.929 --> 00:40:01.766
WE HAVE THE INITIAL TACK THAT

00:40:01.832 --> 00:40:03.801
WE NEED TO DO. WHICH IS

00:40:03.868 --> 00:40:04.702
SOMETHING THAT WITH THE OTHER

00:40:04.769 --> 00:40:06.370
STILL THE THIS SET UP RIGHT TO

00:40:06.437 --> 00:40:08.239
DO THAT YOU CAN. GET THERE

00:40:08.305 --> 00:40:10.307
QUICKER SO NUMBER ONE I THINK

00:40:10.374 --> 00:40:12.376
IS THIS TO PULL WE DO WE NEED

00:40:12.443 --> 00:40:13.778
TO DO IT CENTER Y. COSCO'S

00:40:13.844 --> 00:40:15.146
TALKING ABOUT ON VEGETATION

00:40:15.212 --> 00:40:16.547
MANAGEMENT BUT FIRST WE NEED TO

00:40:16.614 --> 00:40:17.915
GET BE ABLE TO GET RESPOND TO

00:40:17.982 --> 00:40:19.216
THESE LIGHTNING STRIKES IN

00:40:19.283 --> 00:40:20.985
MOSTLY JURIES. IT'S GONNA BE

00:40:21.051 --> 00:40:22.553
LIGHTNING THAT'S CAUSING THESE.

00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:24.455
FIRES AT LEAST IN MY DISTRICT

00:40:24.522 --> 00:40:26.323
SO THE INITIAL ATTACK IS

00:40:26.390 --> 00:40:28.125
CRITICAL BECAUSE THE AMOUNT FOR

00:40:28.192 --> 00:40:29.527
THE TAXPAYER DINNER THE DAY THE

00:40:29.593 --> 00:40:31.195
QUICKER YOU PUT OUT A FIRE ON

00:40:31.262 --> 00:40:33.531
WITH INITIAL TAX- THE MORE

00:40:33.597 --> 00:40:34.632
MONEY YOU CAN SAVE IN THE LONG

00:40:34.698 --> 00:40:36.033
RUN. IS WHEN WE HAVE THESE MEGA

00:40:36.100 --> 00:40:37.835
FIRES IT'S COSTING US BILLIONS

00:40:37.902 --> 00:40:39.637
OF DOLLARS SO THE THIS THIS IS

00:40:39.703 --> 00:40:41.238
PEANUTS COMPARED TO WHAT THE

00:40:41.305 --> 00:40:42.273
AMOUNT THEY'RE GOING TO SAVE

00:40:42.339 --> 00:40:43.908
THE TAXPAYER BY BEING ABLE TO

00:40:43.974 --> 00:40:45.109
GET ON THE INITIAL TAX SO FOR

00:40:45.176 --> 00:40:46.944
ME. THERE'S NO BRAINER I THINK

00:40:47.011 --> 00:40:48.979
THE QUICKER THE BETTER I THINK

00:40:49.046 --> 00:40:50.181
WE SHOULD FRONT LOAD THIS AND

00:40:50.247 --> 00:40:52.082
GET THESE PROJECTS COMPLETED.

00:40:52.149 --> 00:40:53.617
NOT NOT JUST TO GET TO THE

00:40:53.684 --> 00:40:55.920
PLANNING STAGE AND BUILD- I

00:40:55.986 --> 00:40:57.888
KNOW FOR EXAMPLE THE HELLA TAK

00:40:57.955 --> 00:41:00.191
IN BEAVER WERE I GET MY MAIL IT

00:41:00.257 --> 00:41:02.226
ONLY CAN FLY IN THE HELICOPTER

00:41:02.293 --> 00:41:03.027
CAN ONLY COME IN ONE WAY

00:41:03.093 --> 00:41:04.862
BECAUSE- IT'S TOO CLOSE TO

00:41:04.929 --> 00:41:06.297
SCHOOL SO IT ONLY HAS ONE PATH

00:41:06.363 --> 00:41:07.264
IN AND OUT WHEN YOU HAVE WIND

00:41:07.331 --> 00:41:09.033
PROBLEMS IT'S- IT ISSUE FOR

00:41:09.099 --> 00:41:10.201
THAT HELICOPTER TO GET IN AND

00:41:10.267 --> 00:41:11.735
OUT OF THERE. AND WE NEED THAT

00:41:11.802 --> 00:41:13.470
FOR REFUELING AND ABLE TO

00:41:13.537 --> 00:41:15.039
ATTACK THE STARS AND THE WIND

00:41:15.105 --> 00:41:17.007
USUALLY BLOWING WE HAVE EVENTS

00:41:17.074 --> 00:41:19.343
SO FOR ME I THINK WITH THE

00:41:19.410 --> 00:41:19.910
QUICKER THE BETTER AND THEN

00:41:19.977 --> 00:41:21.078
WE'LL TALK ABOUT THE-

00:41:21.145 --> 00:41:22.479
VEGETATION MANAGEMENT AND

00:41:22.546 --> 00:41:26.584
HOPEFULLY ANOTHER. PART OF THIS

00:41:26.650 --> 00:41:27.084
THE- HEARING. YEAH I WAS

00:41:27.151 --> 00:41:28.919
THINKING FOR K. IMPROVE- I

00:41:28.986 --> 00:41:30.387
DON'T SEE CENTER STERN STAND UP

00:41:30.454 --> 00:41:34.291
pREQUIRE- THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE

00:41:34.358 --> 00:41:36.660
WILL BE IN CONTACT. WITH YOU

LET'S MOVE ON TO. ITEM NUMBER

00:41:39.263 --> 00:41:39.930
EIGHTEEN TO GET A HOLD THAT

00:41:39.997 --> 00:41:43.500
MATTER OPEN- LET'S LOOK AT- DR

00:41:43.567 --> 00:41:45.569
WOODS AB THIRTY EIGHT

00:41:45.636 --> 00:41:49.940
DEFENSIBLE SPACE- N. O. CENTERS

00:41:50.007 --> 00:41:52.443
EASTERN I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY I

00:41:52.509 --> 00:41:53.878
MISSED IT I MISSED I CONNOR THE

00:41:53.944 --> 00:41:56.280
BUTTON OKAY. IT IS I JUST

00:41:56.347 --> 00:41:57.281
DIDN'T GET IT I DIDN'T GET A

00:41:57.348 --> 00:41:59.416
CLEAR ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION.

00:41:59.483 --> 00:42:01.685
ABOUT OVERALL STRATEGY ACT I

00:42:01.752 --> 00:42:03.387
WASI WAS STILL LOOKING FOR

00:42:03.454 --> 00:42:05.122
THAT BASED ON THE ALEJO'S.

00:42:05.189 --> 00:42:08.259
ANALYSIS APPORTIONING. DOLLARS

00:42:08.325 --> 00:42:10.127
THINK ABOUT LONG TERM GOALS

HERE I STILL HAVEN'T I STILL

00:42:13.063 --> 00:42:14.732
DIDN'T QUITE HEAR THAT. HOPING

00:42:14.798 --> 00:42:16.333
WE CAN MAYBE DRILL DOWN THERE

00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:18.602
COULD BE ENOUGH NEXT ITEM BUT-

00:42:18.669 --> 00:42:19.236
THE THOUGHT THAT WAS A RELEVANT

00:42:19.303 --> 00:42:23.374
QUESTION. YEAH DEFINITELY

00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:25.309
FAVREAU- THERE'S QUITE A FEW

00:42:25.376 --> 00:42:28.279
BRAND NEW- PROJECTS THAT HAVE

OF ALL IN TERMS OF THE BUDGET

00:51:45.702 --> 00:51:47.671
REQUEST WE THINK THAT- MOST OF

00:51:47.737 --> 00:51:49.573
THEREQUEST IS. A WARRANTED

00:51:49.639 --> 00:51:50.640
CONSISTENT WITH THE

SO I ANY ADDITIONAL FACTORS AND

00:51:54.878 --> 00:51:56.246
THE ASSOCIATED WITH THE MAKE

00:51:56.313 --> 00:51:56.913
SENSE WE DID HAVE TWO

00:51:56.980 --> 00:51:59.916
TECHNICAL- RECOMMENDATIONS I

00:51:59.983 --> 00:52:00.817
JUST MEANT THAT WE WOULD

00:52:00.884 --> 00:52:02.986
RECOMMEND. ALLUDED TO BY MS

00:52:03.053 --> 00:52:05.055
COLLINS- WHEN ONE OF THEM IS

00:52:05.121 --> 00:52:07.390
THAT- THERE'S ONGOING POSITION

00:52:07.457 --> 00:52:09.259
REQUESTED TO DO TRAINING OF NEW

00:52:09.326 --> 00:52:10.660
INSPECTORS AND ALSO PROCUREMENT

00:52:10.727 --> 00:52:12.796
OF THEIR VEHICLES. WE SUGGESTED

00:52:12.863 --> 00:52:14.297
THAT BE ONE TIME IN NATURE THAT

00:52:14.364 --> 00:52:15.332
DEFINITELY WILL BE A

00:52:15.398 --> 00:52:16.967
REPLACEMENT PROCESS- NOT

00:52:17.033 --> 00:52:18.268
NECESSARY OVER THE LONGER TERM

00:52:18.335 --> 00:52:20.036
BY THE BOOK OF THE WORKLOAD

00:52:20.103 --> 00:52:22.005
WILL BE KIND OF FRONT LOAD IT.

00:52:22.072 --> 00:52:22.639
IN IN THE SECOND TECHNICAL

00:52:22.706 --> 00:52:25.175
ADJUSTMENT IS- THAT THERE'S A

00:52:25.242 --> 00:52:26.843
ONE TIME REQUEST FOR FOUR

00:52:26.910 --> 00:52:27.410
HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS TO

00:52:27.477 --> 00:52:29.012
PURCHASE A NEW FIRE ENGINE FOR

00:52:29.079 --> 00:52:29.980
USE AT THE SOUTHERN TRAINING

00:52:30.046 --> 00:52:31.781
FACILITY- WE RECOMMEND

00:52:31.848 --> 00:52:33.283
REJECTING THAT PORTION OF THIS

00:52:33.350 --> 00:52:34.317
REQUESTED THAT'S NOT REALLY

00:52:34.384 --> 00:52:36.386
DIRECTLY RELATED AB THIRTY

00:52:36.453 --> 00:52:38.455
EIGHT IMPLEMENTATION- TO YOUR

00:52:38.522 --> 00:52:40.190
HERE. POINT MISTER CHAIR- YEAH

00:52:40.257 --> 00:52:41.491
WE DID RAISE THIS QUESTION

00:52:41.558 --> 00:52:42.592
CURRENTLY THE ADMINISTRATION OR

00:52:42.659 --> 00:52:44.294
THE DEPARTMENT OF NOT HAVE

00:52:44.361 --> 00:52:46.229
AUTHORITY TO CHARGE A FEE FOR-

00:52:46.296 --> 00:52:47.297
FOR THESE ACTIVITIES AND WE DID

00:52:47.364 --> 00:52:48.365
RAISE THE QUESTION WHETHER THAT

00:52:48.431 --> 00:52:50.033
WOULD BE SOMETHING WORTH. THE

00:52:50.100 --> 00:52:51.601
LEGISLATURE ADMINISTRATION

00:52:51.668 --> 00:52:53.169
ENGAGING IN CONVERSATIONS ABOUT

00:52:53.236 --> 00:52:55.238
IT YOU POINT OUT I THINK IN OUR

00:52:55.305 --> 00:52:57.741
VIEW THIS IS MORE OF A- DIRECT

00:52:57.807 --> 00:52:59.442
SERVICE IN IN RESPONSE TO A

00:52:59.509 --> 00:53:00.477
REQUEST FROM A HOMEOWNER

00:53:00.544 --> 00:53:02.846
PROPERTY OWNER UPON SALE. ON IN

00:53:02.913 --> 00:53:04.281
IN THE OTHER ADVANTAGE OF-

00:53:04.347 --> 00:53:05.882
CONCERNING THE CREATION OF A

00:53:05.949 --> 00:53:08.251
FEE OF FORTY FOR THIS ACTIVITY

00:53:08.318 --> 00:53:09.352
WOULD BE THAT ULTIMATELY THAT

00:53:09.419 --> 00:53:11.054
REVENUE THEN WOULD OFFSET THE

00:53:11.121 --> 00:53:12.289
NECESSITY FOR USING GENERAL

00:53:12.355 --> 00:53:14.224
FUND ON AN ONGOING BASIS. FOR

00:53:14.291 --> 00:53:16.359
THIS PROGRAM. AND IF I COULD WE

00:53:16.426 --> 00:53:17.460
JUST HAD ONE OTHER SNOW

00:53:17.527 --> 00:53:18.762
RECOMMENDATION WHICH IS TO

00:53:18.828 --> 00:53:20.397
ADOPT A REPORTING LANGUAGE FOR

00:53:20.463 --> 00:53:21.565
THIS PROGRAM ON AN ONGOING

00:53:21.631 --> 00:53:23.500
BASIS AND- THIS IS REALLY JUST

00:53:23.567 --> 00:53:24.668
THAT REFLECT THE FACT THAT THIS

00:53:24.734 --> 00:53:25.902
IS A BRAND NEW WORKLOAD FOR THE

00:53:25.969 --> 00:53:27.504
DEPARTMENT AND SO. WE THOUGHT

00:53:27.571 --> 00:53:29.372
THEY TOOK A REASONABLE APPROACH

00:53:29.439 --> 00:53:30.640
TO ESTIMATING WHAT THE ONGOING

00:53:30.707 --> 00:53:33.143
WORKLOAD WOULD BE- BUT THERE'S

00:53:33.209 --> 00:53:34.778
A LEVEL OF UNCERTAINTY BY

00:53:34.844 --> 00:53:41.851
VIRTUE OF IT BEING MALE AND THE.

00:53:41.918 --> 00:53:42.419
THE REASON WE THINK THIS IS

00:53:42.485 --> 00:53:43.019
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT IN- TWO

00:53:43.086 --> 00:53:43.620
WEEKS. THAT COULD BE HIGHER

00:53:43.687 --> 00:53:44.154
THAN INTO. IN THE BUDGET

00:53:44.220 --> 00:53:46.022
REQUEST. THERE IS A POSSIBILITY

00:53:46.089 --> 00:53:47.424
THEN THAT THE DEPARTMENT MIGHT

00:53:47.490 --> 00:53:48.892
HAVE TO DIVERT RESOURCES FROM

00:53:48.959 --> 00:53:50.994
OTHER. PROGRAMS TO ENSURE THAT

00:53:51.061 --> 00:53:51.861
THEY MEET THE STATUTORILY

00:53:51.928 --> 00:53:54.798
REQUIRED- WORKLOAD AND SHOW- TO

00:53:54.864 --> 00:53:55.865
CAN WE HAVE SOME REPORTING ON

00:53:55.932 --> 00:53:57.701
ON WORKLOAD GOING FORWARD THAT

00:53:57.767 --> 00:53:58.802
COULD INFORM FUTURE.

00:53:58.868 --> 00:54:00.670
ADJUSTMENTS WE MIGHT NEED TO

00:54:00.737 --> 00:54:01.538
MAKE TO FUND THE PROGRAM

00:54:01.605 --> 00:54:03.607
APPROPRIATELY. FILLETING GAUGE

00:54:03.673 --> 00:54:04.975
WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION MISTER

00:54:05.041 --> 00:54:08.111
BENSON MISS MORE AT FINANCE.

00:54:08.178 --> 00:54:10.547
YOUR RECOGNIZED MISTER BENSON.

00:54:10.614 --> 00:54:12.382
MORNING MR THANK YOU STEVEN

00:54:12.449 --> 00:54:13.950
BENSON APARTMENT FINANCES JUST

00:54:14.017 --> 00:54:15.151
VERY BRIEFLY AS FAR TO SAY LIKE

00:54:15.218 --> 00:54:17.954
WE COMPLETELY OPEN TO THE

00:54:18.021 --> 00:54:20.390
CONVERSATION- I THINK MILAN'S

00:54:20.457 --> 00:54:22.726
OF THE ADMINISTRATION PART OF

00:54:22.792 --> 00:54:24.260
THE REASON WHY WE DIDN'T WE

00:54:24.327 --> 00:54:25.095
DON'T HAVE THE AUTHORITY WE

00:54:25.161 --> 00:54:26.529
DIDN'T PROPOSE THE AUTHORITY

00:54:26.596 --> 00:54:28.064
FOR HE IS LOOKING OUT FOR ME IN

00:54:28.131 --> 00:54:30.634
A BIG BENEFIT PERSPECTIVE-

00:54:30.700 --> 00:54:32.068
THERE'S ABSOLUTELY A BENEFIT TO

00:54:32.135 --> 00:54:33.770
THE HOME SELLER AND HOMEBUYER.

00:54:33.837 --> 00:54:34.904
AND THIS TRANSACTIONS YOU'RE

00:54:34.971 --> 00:54:36.606
RIGHT THERE'S NO ARGUMENT THERE

00:54:36.673 --> 00:54:38.141
I THINK THERE'S ALSO A LARGER

00:54:38.208 --> 00:54:39.709
PUBLIC BENEFIT TO THE MEANT TO

00:54:39.776 --> 00:54:41.277
BE SPENT THE WEEK IN

00:54:41.344 --> 00:54:42.946
CENTRALIZING MOTIVATE PEOPLE TO

00:54:43.013 --> 00:54:44.314
CREATE A MENTAL SPACE AND THE

00:54:44.381 --> 00:54:45.615
SAFETY THAT IT CREATES ROUND

00:54:45.682 --> 00:54:47.884
COMMUNITIES AND HOMES SO I

00:54:47.951 --> 00:54:48.485
THINK PART OF IT WAS THAT WAS

00:54:48.551 --> 00:54:50.387
OUR VIEW AND JENNIFER WAS

00:54:50.453 --> 00:54:51.521
APPROPRIATE BECAUSE THE GENERAL

00:54:51.588 --> 00:54:53.323
BENEFIT BUT AGAIN CERTAINLY UP

00:54:53.390 --> 00:54:54.557
IN THE CONVERSATION I THINK

00:54:54.624 --> 00:54:56.026
IT'S A GOOD ONE TO HAVE. A LOOK

00:54:56.092 --> 00:54:56.993
FORWARD TO HAVING THOSE

00:54:57.060 --> 00:54:59.162
CONVERSATIONS RECOGNIZE SENATOR

00:54:59.229 --> 00:55:05.669
STERN- HAS HIS. HEAD UP AND

00:55:05.735 --> 00:55:06.302
THEN I'LL GO TO SENATE MCGUIRE.

00:55:06.369 --> 00:55:08.571
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- IT GOES

00:55:08.638 --> 00:55:10.173
BACK TO THE SAME THING THAT WE

00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:11.975
TRY TO GET ON THE MY FIRST

00:55:12.042 --> 00:55:13.843
QUESTION JUST IN TERMS F HOW

00:55:13.910 --> 00:55:15.311
THIS FITS INTO THE BROADER

00:55:15.378 --> 00:55:18.148
STRATEGY SO AND JUST AND JUST

00:55:18.214 --> 00:55:20.083
TO BE CLEAR ABOUT THE MY LAST

00:55:20.150 --> 00:55:22.352
POINT IT WAS NOT- THAT WE MAY

00:55:22.419 --> 00:55:24.087
BE OVERSHOOTING THE BUDGET HERE

00:55:24.154 --> 00:55:25.989
I DON'T WANT TO BE MISTAKEN IN

00:55:26.056 --> 00:55:28.892
THAT REGARD I. AGREE WITH CHIEF

00:55:28.958 --> 00:55:29.492
PORTER BILLION DOLLARS SOUNDS

00:55:29.559 --> 00:55:32.429
BIG- BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE

00:55:32.495 --> 00:55:32.996
FIRE LIABILITIES STATE IT'S

00:55:33.063 --> 00:55:35.432
ACTUALLY. IT'S A DROP IN THE

00:55:35.498 --> 00:55:37.934
BUCKET- SO I DIDN'T MEAN TO

00:55:38.001 --> 00:55:39.102
IMPLY THAT WE MAY BE

00:55:39.169 --> 00:55:40.270
OVERSHOOTING IT I'M JUST TRYING

00:55:40.336 --> 00:55:41.705
TO GET A SENSE OF HOW THE

00:55:41.771 --> 00:55:43.573
PUZZLE PIECES FIT TOGETHER AND

00:55:43.640 --> 00:55:45.375
IN FACT I THINK A PROPER NEEDS

00:55:45.442 --> 00:55:47.077
ASSESSMENT WOULD REVEAL THAT WE

00:55:47.143 --> 00:55:47.911
ARE UNDER SHOOTING THE BUDGET

00:55:47.977 --> 00:55:50.380
HERE. AND I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY

00:55:50.447 --> 00:55:52.082
WHERE BUT I'D LIKE TO HAVE THAT

00:55:52.148 --> 00:55:55.118
ASSESSMENT REALLY DRIVES AND

00:55:55.185 --> 00:55:56.886
NOT JUST ABOUT AVOIDED ACREAGE

00:55:56.953 --> 00:55:58.722
BURNED BUT ABOUT STRUCTURAL

00:55:58.788 --> 00:56:00.724
DEFENSE AND TO THAT END NO MY

00:56:00.790 --> 00:56:03.159
QUESTION ON THIS ONE IS IT

00:56:03.226 --> 00:56:04.527
LOOKS IT LOOKS SORT OF ORIENTED

00:56:04.594 --> 00:56:06.796
ON COMPLIANCE DOCUMENTATION AND

00:56:06.863 --> 00:56:08.965
TRANSACTION BASED. ON THE DATA

00:56:09.032 --> 00:56:12.168
HERE SAYS THAT THAT SAY ABOUT

00:56:12.235 --> 00:56:16.139
TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND HOME SOTHE NECESSARY. TERRITORY IN

00:56:16.206 --> 00:56:19.175
TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUT- BUT BETTER

00:56:19.242 --> 00:56:20.944
SEVEN OR THIRTY THOUSAND PEOPLE

00:56:21.010 --> 00:56:22.512
ACTUALLY LIVE THERE BUT- THIS

00:56:22.579 --> 00:56:23.813
ISN'T ABOUT THE COMMUNITIES

00:56:23.880 --> 00:56:25.648
THAT ACTUALLY. LIVE IN THE WILL

00:56:25.715 --> 00:56:27.517
WE THIS ISN'T MORE ABOUT THE

MODERN A PERMANENT FUNDING

01:00:14.811 --> 01:00:15.812
SOURCE FOR VEGETATION

01:00:15.878 --> 01:00:17.914
MANAGEMENT IN HOME HARDENING IN

01:00:17.981 --> 01:00:21.451
WHY WE ARE HERE. ALMOST THIRTY

01:00:21.517 --> 01:00:23.286
SIX MONTHS LATER TO THE DAY

01:00:23.353 --> 01:00:26.589
WHEN THIS LEGISLATURE PASSED-

01:00:26.656 --> 01:00:28.691
AB THIRTY EIGHT. AND IT'S NOT

01:00:28.758 --> 01:00:31.127
BEEN FUNDED. AND CONTINUES TO

01:00:31.194 --> 01:00:33.997
STRIP THE FUNDING- JUST MY MIND

01:00:34.063 --> 01:00:36.933
IS BLOWN. AT IN THE TO BE

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:38.968
HONEST THE AB THIRTY EIGHT HAD

01:00:39.035 --> 01:00:40.503
FUNDING ATTACHED. IT WAS

01:00:40.570 --> 01:00:44.607
STRIPPED OUT. SO ON THE S. R.

01:00:44.674 --> 01:00:48.111
AMFI I AM 110% AGAINST THE S.

01:00:48.177 --> 01:00:50.413
R. AMFI WE'VE HAD CONVERSATIONS

01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:53.916
HERE ABOUT ON FAIRLY. TAXING

01:00:53.983 --> 01:00:55.651
RURAL RESIDENTS WHEN THEY

DIDN'T EVEN RECEIVE THE

01:00:56.386 --> 01:00:58.254
SERVICES CAL FIRE BUT WHERE

01:00:58.321 --> 01:01:00.957
THE- CHAIR WAS SAYING IS THAT

01:01:01.024 --> 01:01:04.594
IF THIS IS- A FEE ATTACHED TO A

01:01:04.660 --> 01:01:06.796
HOME WHO NEEDS THE SERVICE TO

01:01:06.863 --> 01:01:08.598
BE ABLE TO SELL AND THAT'S JUST

01:01:08.664 --> 01:01:12.135
BE CANDID AT THE NUMBER ONE

01:01:12.201 --> 01:01:12.702
MISTAKE FOR CALIFORNIANS IS

01:01:12.769 --> 01:01:15.738
THEIR HOME. SO THIS IS A

01:01:15.805 --> 01:01:17.707
POTENTIAL EQUITABLE APPROACH.

01:01:17.774 --> 01:01:19.142
NOT JUST BASED ON AND A

01:01:19.208 --> 01:01:20.610
GEOGRAPHY OF WHERE AN

01:01:20.676 --> 01:01:22.779
INDIVIDUAL LIVES WHICH I THINK

01:01:22.845 --> 01:01:25.548
OF CHOOSING MORE EQUITY SO I A

01:01:25.615 --> 01:01:26.949

MISTER CHAIR. THAT WE COULD

01:01:29.352 --> 01:01:30.753

THIS AND CANDIDLY I JUST DON'T

01:01:33.256 --> 01:01:35.091
THINK THE ERLY ACTION THAT IS

01:01:35.158 --> 01:01:37.860
BEING PROPOSED IN THIS BUDGET

01:01:37.927 --> 01:01:40.396
IS AT ALL ADEQUATE. FOR WHERE

01:01:40.463 --> 01:01:41.631
WE NEED TO GO FOR FIRE

01:01:41.697 --> 01:01:45.935
PREVENTION AS WELL AS FIRE

01:01:46.002 --> 01:01:46.536

01:24:35.136 --> 01:24:37.338
OUR EXITING OVER FIVE HUNDRED

01:24:37.405 --> 01:24:40.975

BEING BROUGHT FORWARD THIS YEAR

01:24:48.416 --> 01:24:50.251
I'M NOT QUITE SURE BECAUSE THE

01:24:50.318 --> 01:24:52.120
REASON FOR THE OVER FIVE

01:24:52.187 --> 01:24:52.754
HUNDRED FULL TIME FIREFIGHTERS

ABLE TO REDUCE THE NEED FOR

01:24:58.626 --> 01:25:01.729
OVERTIME AND I JUST DON'T KNOW

01:25:01.796 --> 01:25:03.031
WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT POINT.

01:25:03.097 --> 01:25:05.366
THE LAST THING I WANT TO SAY IS

01:25:05.433 --> 01:25:05.900
WE SAY THAT WE'RE RELYING

01:25:05.967 --> 01:25:08.436
NATIONAL GUARD. DAHLE NATIONAL

01:25:08.503 --> 01:25:09.737
GUARD COMES IN AFTER ALL HELL'S

01:25:09.804 --> 01:25:11.306
BROKEN LOOSE IN COMMUNITIES

01:25:11.372 --> 01:25:13.775

GOING TO BE MODERN DAY AND BE

01:25:23.284 --> 01:25:24.185
ABLE TO COMBAT BOTH THE FIRE

01:25:24.252 --> 01:25:25.487
PREVENTION AS WELL AS A FIRE

01:25:25.553 --> 01:25:27.188
PRESENT THAT RESPONSE IT IS

01:25:27.255 --> 01:25:28.890
NEEDED FUTURE I WENT ON A

01:25:28.957 --> 01:25:31.059
LITTLE LONG I APOLOGIZE- BUT

01:25:31.125 --> 01:25:33.261
THOSE ARE MY CONCERNS ON WHY I

01:25:33.328 --> 01:25:34.562
BELIEVE WE NEED ENHANCE BUDGET

01:25:34.629 --> 01:25:35.930
THIS YEAR. FOR PREVENTION

01:25:35.997 --> 01:25:37.732

01:25:37.799 --> 01:25:41.035
DOLLY I JUST WANT TO ADD TO

01:25:41.102 --> 01:25:42.504
COMMONSENSE AND REQUIRE. LOOK

01:25:42.570 --> 01:25:44.739
WE HAVE TO FOCUS ON PUTTING

01:25:44.806 --> 01:25:48.142
FIRES OUT THAT ARE. A THREAT.

01:25:48.209 --> 01:25:50.078
BUT WE ALSO NEED TO FOCUS ON.

01:25:50.144 --> 01:25:51.946
VEGETATION MANAGEMENT LOOK WE

01:25:52.013 --> 01:25:52.580
ARE NEVER GOING TO GET OUT OF

01:25:52.647 --> 01:25:54.415
THE CYCLE. INTEL WE DO

01:25:54.482 --> 01:25:55.884
VEGETATION MANAGEMENT AND DO IT

01:25:55.950 --> 01:25:57.819
AGGRESSIVELY AND THAT MEET IN

01:25:57.886 --> 01:25:59.888
MY MIND ITS CONTRACTORS.

01:25:59.954 --> 01:26:01.856
INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS BECAUSE

01:26:01.923 --> 01:26:03.358
WE DO NOT HAVE THE WORKFORCE.

01:26:03.424 --> 01:26:04.926
WITH STATE EMPLOYEES TO BE ABLE

01:26:04.993 --> 01:26:06.327
TO DO THE WORK THAT WE NEED TO

01:26:06.394 --> 01:26:07.428
BE THEY NEED TO GET DONE OUT

01:26:07.495 --> 01:26:09.097
THERE. AND ON TOP OF THAT WE

01:26:09.163 --> 01:26:10.231
NEED TO BE PARTNERING WITH THE

01:26:10.298 --> 01:26:12.233
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. BECAUSE A

01:26:12.300 --> 01:26:14.235
LARGE PORTION OF THE LANDS IN

01:26:14.302 --> 01:26:17.238
CALIFORNIA OUR- ARE. OWNED BY

01:26:17.305 --> 01:26:18.840
THEM AND THEY IN THERE'S A

01:26:18.907 --> 01:26:20.575
THERE'S A HUGE NEXUS BETWEEN

01:26:20.642 --> 01:26:22.844
WILDLAND FIRE FORCED AND GIVEN

01:26:22.911 --> 01:26:24.712

FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. TO MAKE

01:26:28.683 --> 01:26:31.986
THIS WORK. WELL WITH THAT WE

01:26:32.053 --> 01:26:35.056
WILL HOLD ITEM NUMBER NINETEEN-

01:26:35.123 --> 01:26:38.393

NOW ON ITEM NUMBER TWENTY WE

01:26:43.464 --> 01:26:44.899
COULD INVITE THE PRIVATE SECTOR

01:26:44.966 --> 01:26:46.601

FIRE CRISIS. YOU TALK ABOUT THE

01:28:02.877 --> 01:28:04.812
STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK FOR WHICH

HOW TO FIND IT AND MOVE FORWARD

01:28:08.816 --> 01:28:10.118
TO ACHIEVE HIGHER RESILIENCE IN

01:28:32.306 --> 01:28:34.676
CHALLENGES SO THIS LAST YEAR IN

01:28:34.742 --> 01:28:36.444
CALIFORNIA WE HAVE FIVE OF THE

01:28:36.511 --> 01:28:38.379
SIX LARGEST FIRES IN THE STATE

01:28:38.446 --> 01:28:41.749
BURNING SIMULTANEOUSLY AND-

01:28:41.816 --> 01:28:44.719
AND- WE HAD TWO HUNDRED FIFTY

01:28:44.786 --> 01:28:46.287
THOUSAND PEOPLE DISPLACED WE

01:28:46.354 --> 01:28:48.523
HAD TOXIC SMOKE- ACROSS

01:28:48.589 --> 01:28:55.063
CALIFORNIA FOR WEEKS IMPACTING.

01:28:55.129 --> 01:28:56.230
PEOPLE'S HEALTH. AND THIS IS A-

01:28:56.297 --> 01:28:56.798
INCREASE FROM WE'VE SEEN IN

01:28:56.864 --> 01:28:59.434
PREVIOUS. HE QUICKLY SEGMENT IN

01:28:59.500 --> 01:29:00.435
TWENTY. PREDICTED THAT WE WOULD

01:29:00.501 --> 01:29:04.539
SEE 18% 77% INCREASE IN

01:29:04.605 --> 01:29:07.175
CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRE- BY THE

01:29:07.241 --> 01:29:09.577
END OFTHE CENTURY 77% INCREASE

01:29:09.644 --> 01:29:11.579
IN ANNUAL ACRES BURNED. THIS

01:29:11.646 --> 01:29:13.448
LAST YEAR WE HAD FOUR POINT TWO

01:29:13.514 --> 01:29:16.284
MILLION ACRES BURNED IN TWENTY

01:29:16.350 --> 01:29:17.518
NINETEEN WE HAD TWO HUNDRED AND

01:29:17.585 --> 01:29:18.953
SEVENTY SEVEN. THOUSAND ACRES

01:29:19.020 --> 01:29:21.889
BURN THAT'S A 15100% INCREASE

01:29:21.956 --> 01:29:24.125
IN ONE FIRE SEASON ALONE AT

01:29:24.192 --> 01:29:25.426
FOUR FOLD INCREASE OVER OUR

ANNUAL AVERAGE OUT BEFORE THIS

01:29:27.562 --> 01:29:29.731
YEAR. AND SO WHAT WE'RE SEEING

01:29:29.797 --> 01:29:31.566
IS THAT THE PREDICTIONS OF THE

01:29:31.632 --> 01:29:33.634
CRIME AB PLANET REDUCTIONS THAT

01:29:33.701 --> 01:29:34.635

FORCED HER BACK OVERLY DENSE.

01:30:02.930 --> 01:30:03.498
THE POLITICS OF THE EARLY TURN

01:30:03.564 --> 01:30:05.066
OF THE CENTURY FORCED THE

01:30:05.133 --> 01:30:06.434

CALIFORNIA'S ECOLOGY AND WHAT'S

01:30:15.676 --> 01:30:16.677
HAPPENED IS THAT NOW WE HAVE

01:30:16.744 --> 01:30:18.179
OUR NATURAL FIRE RETURN

01:30:18.246 --> 01:30:19.180
INTERVALS THROUGHOUT THE STATE

DROUGHT- THE STATE DURING THIS

01:31:33.621 --> 01:31:35.256
EPISODE OF TREE MORTALITY THOSE

01:31:35.323 --> 01:31:36.891
TREES HAD BEEN STANDING. THERE

01:31:36.958 --> 01:31:38.492
NOW ON THE GROUNDS AND THEY ARE

01:31:38.559 --> 01:31:47.635
CREATING THE FUEL LOAD- FOR US

01:31:47.702 --> 01:31:49.270
ROUTE THE STATE. AND SO THESE

01:31:49.337 --> 01:31:51.105
FIRE THAT HAPPENED WE FIRE

01:31:51.172 --> 01:31:51.639
PREDICTIVE MODEL THAT INTO%

01:31:51.706 --> 01:31:53.841
ABOUT THREE INCH DIAMETER WERE.

01:31:53.908 --> 01:31:55.209
TRAINING IF YOU'LL DRIVEN FIRE

01:31:55.276 --> 01:31:56.344
INDUSTRY OR TELL AREA. HERE NOW

01:31:56.410 --> 01:31:58.279
HAVE THIRTY DI&lt;c.cyan&gt; WOULD. THESE&lt;/c&gt;

01:31:58.346 --> 01:32:00.781
FIRES WHICH IS. HI WHAT PRINT

01:32:00.848 --> 01:32:02.049
THROUGHOUT THE FLIGHT CLOSING

01:32:02.116 --> 01:32:04.452
WHY EVENTS FROM THE SPY LED TO

01:32:04.518 --> 01:32:06.354
CREEK FOR. CREATED A YOU CLOUD

01:32:06.420 --> 01:32:10.558
THAT WOULD. I WASN'T INTO THE

01:32:10.625 --> 01:32:12.960
APPS. WHICH COLOR ON. PUTTING

01:32:13.027 --> 01:32:15.329
HURRICANE WIND. OUT IN EVERY

01:32:15.396 --> 01:32:17.331
DIRECTION ON THAT FIRE RATHER

01:32:17.398 --> 01:32:18.499
THAN JUST HAVING ONE WIND

01:32:18.566 --> 01:32:20.234
DRIVEN FRONT AND A WHITE IT

01:32:20.301 --> 01:32:21.769
CREATES A REALLY DYNAMIC AND

01:32:21.836 --> 01:32:23.838
DIFFICULT TO MANAGE AND

01:32:23.905 --> 01:32:25.740
MITIGATE FIRES. QUESTION IS HOW

01:32:25.806 --> 01:32:27.508
DO WE ARRESTED THESE CASCADING

01:32:27.575 --> 01:32:29.710
CLIMATE EVENTS- FROM THE TOXIC

01:32:29.777 --> 01:32:31.178
SMOKE THAT'S COMING OUT OF THIS

01:32:31.245 --> 01:32:33.981
PROBLEM AND WE- NEED MUDSLIDES

01:32:34.048 --> 01:32:35.650
FROM HEAT DAMAGE TO OUR

01:32:35.716 --> 01:32:37.251
WATERSHED THE DAMAGED OR

01:32:37.318 --> 01:32:39.020
HABITAT AND MOST IMPORTANTLY.

01:32:39.086 --> 01:32:40.621
THE DEVASTATION TO OUR

01:32:40.688 --> 01:32:43.224
CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES. AND

01:32:43.291 --> 01:32:45.626
THERE ARE REALLY THREE FRANK Q.

01:32:45.693 --> 01:32:47.662
ADDRESSING WILDFIRE RESILIENCE

01:32:47.728 --> 01:32:49.830
IN CALIFORNIA AND OFTEN I HEAR

01:32:49.897 --> 01:32:51.132
PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT THESE I

01:32:51.198 --> 01:32:53.534
STAND ALONE BUT HE REALLY NEEDS

01:32:53.601 --> 01:32:54.602
TO BE ADDRESSED IN EVERY

01:32:54.669 --> 01:32:56.370
COMMUNITY. ALL THREE OF THESE

01:32:56.437 --> 01:32:58.706
FRONTS SIMULTANEOUSLY AT

01:32:58.773 --> 01:33:01.342
DIFFERENT RATIOS FOR DIFFERENT

01:33:01.409 --> 01:33:02.209
COMMUNITIES. THREE FIRE

01:33:02.276 --> 01:33:04.679
RESILIENT FRONT- EVEN THEM AS

01:33:04.745 --> 01:33:07.381
CAN CIRCLES THEY ARE ON THE

01:33:07.448 --> 01:33:08.983
INNERMOST CIRCLE IT WOULD BE

01:33:09.050 --> 01:33:10.818
HARD HOMES AND COMMUNITIES THIS

01:33:10.885 --> 01:33:15.790
IS THE WORST. YOU HAVE

01:33:15.856 --> 01:33:17.458
DEFENSIBLE SPACE AND RETROFITS

01:33:17.525 --> 01:33:19.327
ON YOUR HOME SO THAT HOMES AND

01:33:19.393 --> 01:33:21.429
COMMUNITIES CAN SURVIVE THE

01:33:21.495 --> 01:33:23.464
NEXT AREA WOULD BE THE WILDLAND

01:33:23.531 --> 01:33:24.765
URBAN INTERFACE THIS IS WHERE

01:33:24.832 --> 01:33:26.667
WE PUT STRATEGIC FUEL BREAKS

01:33:26.734 --> 01:33:28.703
AROUND IN COMMUNITIES. TO BE

01:33:28.769 --> 01:33:30.671
ABLE TO R. RANCHO WIRE AND

01:33:30.738 --> 01:33:33.607
CREATE A STATE ROUTE. FOR THESE

01:33:33.674 --> 01:33:35.643
CATASTROPHIC FIRES AND SO THE

01:33:35.710 --> 01:33:36.744
STRATEGIC FUEL BREAKS ARE

01:33:36.811 --> 01:33:39.046
CRUCIAL TO BEING ABLE TO ENSURE

01:33:39.113 --> 01:33:40.548
THAT WE CAN STOP BY YOUR FROM

01:33:40.614 --> 01:33:41.983
COMING INTO A COMMUNITY AND

01:33:42.049 --> 01:33:43.985
THAT COMMUNITIES CAN ESCAPE- IF

01:33:44.051 --> 01:33:45.786
A FIRE IS COMING THROUGH. AND

01:33:45.853 --> 01:33:47.455
THE LAST AREA IT'S REALLY THE

01:33:47.521 --> 01:33:49.423
ENTIRE WILD PLANTS ENSURING

01:33:49.490 --> 01:33:52.827
THAT OUR ECOLOGIES ARE RESTORED

01:33:52.893 --> 01:33:54.328
TO THEIR NATURAL GAIL AND

01:33:54.395 --> 01:33:56.397
LEVELS OF BUYER THAT'S NEEDED

01:33:56.464 --> 01:33:58.065
SO THIS IS RESTORING FORESTED

01:33:58.132 --> 01:34:00.701
WATERSHEDS MEANING OUT-

01:34:00.768 --> 01:34:02.336
UNDERGROWTH UNDERGROWTH DOING

01:34:02.403 --> 01:34:03.971
VEGETATION MANAGEMENT- IT

01:34:04.038 --> 01:34:05.606
CHAPARRAL ECOSYSTEM. WHERE

01:34:05.673 --> 01:34:07.241
RESTORING CHAPARRAL FROM NATIVE

01:34:07.308 --> 01:34:09.076
GRASSES BECAUSE THERE ARE MORE

01:34:09.143 --> 01:34:11.012
FIRE RESILIENT THAN THE NATIVE

01:34:11.078 --> 01:34:12.780
GRASSES AND THEY NEED MASON

01:34:12.847 --> 01:34:15.116
GRASSES EXCUSE ME AND SO AN

01:34:15.182 --> 01:34:16.884
INSURING THAT WE HAD A HEALTHY

01:34:16.951 --> 01:34:19.253
LANDSCAPES THAT ARE HAVING

01:34:19.320 --> 01:34:21.222
THEIR WARM FIRE INTENSITY AND

01:34:21.288 --> 01:34:23.090
THEIR NORMAL FIRE. RETURN

01:34:23.157 --> 01:34:25.860
INTERVALS WILL REDUCE THE

01:34:25.926 --> 01:34:27.528
INTENSITY OF THE FIRES THAT WE

01:34:27.595 --> 01:34:29.096
ARE SEEING YOUR TEACHER YOUR

01:34:29.163 --> 01:34:30.898
BRAKES WILL ALLOW FIREFIGHTERS

01:34:30.965 --> 01:34:32.266
TO TAKE A STAND AND COMMUNITIES

01:34:32.333 --> 01:34:34.535
TO ESCAPE AND HARDEN HOMES WILL

01:34:34.602 --> 01:34:36.670
ALLOW COMMUNITIES TO SURVIVE IN

01:34:36.737 --> 01:34:43.944
THE WORST. CASE THAT A FIRE

01:34:44.011 --> 01:34:44.545
COMES THROUGH. THERE ARE ALSO

01:34:44.612 --> 01:34:45.813
WE COURT. YOU KNOW WHEN WE ARE

01:34:45.880 --> 01:34:47.782
LOOKING IN OF THE FROM. WE ALSO

01:34:47.848 --> 01:34:48.549
NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE

01:34:48.616 --> 01:34:50.618
AT BESTING IN A WAVE EXTRA. AND

01:34:50.684 --> 01:34:51.585
IT SOME OF THE BAY AREA THAT

01:34:51.652 --> 01:34:53.921
HAVE BEEN IN. OUR CAPACITY TO

01:34:53.988 --> 01:34:55.589
SCALE UP BY A RESILIENT IN THE

01:34:55.656 --> 01:34:58.826
STATE. CORE PRINCIPLES AND

01:34:58.893 --> 01:34:59.460
THREE BARRIERS THAT WE'RE

01:34:59.527 --> 01:35:01.595
ADDRESSING THE CORE PRINCIPLES

01:35:01.662 --> 01:35:03.364
ARE REALLY FOCUSING ON THE

01:35:03.431 --> 01:35:05.900
REGIONAL APPROACH BECAUSE THERE

01:35:05.966 --> 01:35:07.168
REALLY ARE SOME FIRE RESILIENCE

01:35:07.234 --> 01:35:08.903
ARE GONNA REQUIRE DIFFERENT

01:35:08.969 --> 01:35:09.804
RATIOS IN DIFFERENT

01:35:09.870 --> 01:35:11.205
COMMUNITIES. BASED ON THE

01:35:11.272 --> 01:35:13.674
TOPOGRAPHY THE DENSITY OF HOMES

01:35:13.741 --> 01:35:14.842
THE COMMUNITIES SURROUNDING

01:35:14.909 --> 01:35:16.577
ECOLOGY AND SO WE'RE REALLY

01:35:16.644 --> 01:35:18.846
ZEROING IN ON ENSURING THAT OUR

01:35:18.913 --> 01:35:21.215
RESOURCES ARE BEING DRIVEN AND

01:35:21.282 --> 01:35:23.684
DESIGNED. BY WHAT COMMUNITIES

01:35:23.751 --> 01:35:25.252
NEED AND THAT THEY HAVE THE

01:35:25.319 --> 01:35:27.755
TOOLS TO BE ABLE TO CREATE

01:35:27.822 --> 01:35:30.324
REGIONAL DESIGN PROGRAMS AND

01:35:30.391 --> 01:35:32.026
THAT ARE GRANT CAN ACTUALLY

01:35:32.093 --> 01:35:34.595
COME INTO YOU AND DELIVER. FOR

01:35:34.662 --> 01:35:36.197
THOSE COMMUNITIES A COLLECTIVE

01:35:36.263 --> 01:35:37.932
VISION THAT IS BASED ON LOCAL

01:35:37.998 --> 01:35:39.900
SCIENCE. THE OTHER PRINCIPAL

01:35:39.967 --> 01:35:41.435
WAS REALLY ENSURING THAT WE ARE

01:35:41.502 --> 01:35:42.970
BASING THIS ON ADAPTIVE

01:35:43.037 --> 01:35:44.705
MANAGEMENT AND SCIENCE SCIENCE

01:35:44.772 --> 01:35:47.141
BASED MANAGEMENT. TO ENSURE

01:35:47.208 --> 01:35:52.413
THAT. WE ARE HAVING- A AT THE

01:35:52.480 --> 01:35:54.081
END THAT WE ARE. UNDER AND

01:35:54.148 --> 01:35:55.316
ADAPTING THE RE. OF THE SHIPS

01:35:55.382 --> 01:35:57.418
AND CLIMATE CHANGE FOR EXAMPLE

01:35:57.485 --> 01:35:59.353
YOU KNOW INTERESTING REQUIRE. A

01:35:59.420 --> 01:36:01.122
PREDICTIVE MODELS YOU TAKE INTO

01:36:01.188 --> 01:36:03.023
ACCOUNT THESE STANDING DEAD

01:36:03.090 --> 01:36:05.826
TREES- ON THE GROUNDS AND

01:36:05.893 --> 01:36:07.461
UPDATE THOSE YOUR MODELS BUT

01:36:07.528 --> 01:36:09.230
THAT REQUIRES RESEARCH DATA

01:36:09.296 --> 01:36:11.132
ANALYTICS AND ADAPTIVE

01:36:11.198 --> 01:36:12.066
MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES AND SO

01:36:12.133 --> 01:36:13.868
THAT'S THOROUGHLY INCORPORATED.

01:36:13.934 --> 01:36:15.636
INTO THIS FUNDING AS WELL TO

01:36:15.703 --> 01:36:17.071
ENSURE THAT THE STEPS WE ARE

01:36:17.138 --> 01:36:18.405
TAKING ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE

01:36:18.472 --> 01:36:19.507
SECONDARY AN UNFORESEEN

01:36:19.573 --> 01:36:21.308
NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS.

01:36:21.375 --> 01:36:22.776
AND THAT WE ARE TAKING STEPS

01:36:22.843 --> 01:36:23.978
THAT ARE BUILDING UP TOWARDS

01:36:24.044 --> 01:36:26.046
FIRE RESILIENT OR THE NEXT

01:36:26.113 --> 01:36:30.718
GENERATIONS TO COME. RATHER

01:36:30.784 --> 01:36:31.285
THAN JUST THE IMMEDIATE FIRE

01:36:31.352 --> 01:36:31.852
SEASON. IN ADDITION TO BEING

01:36:31.919 --> 01:36:33.888
PRICE OR WHAT BE CLEAR AT LEAST

01:36:33.954 --> 01:36:35.789
ALL HAVE REALLY TO- AND-

01:36:35.856 --> 01:36:37.391
RESULTS. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE

01:36:37.458 --> 01:36:40.528
IT'S LASTING AS WELL. WE WERE

01:36:40.594 --> 01:36:41.795
GOING TO BE FOCUSING ON AND

01:36:41.862 --> 01:36:44.765
INVESTING IN. AREAS THAT WILL

01:36:44.832 --> 01:36:46.467
ALLOW US TO SCALE UP MORE

01:36:46.534 --> 01:36:47.902
QUICKLY AREAS THAT WE HAVE BEEN

01:36:47.968 --> 01:36:50.704
SEEN- GAS SHORTAGES THAT WE CAN

01:36:50.771 --> 01:36:52.673
PUT AN INFUSION OF RESOURCES.

01:36:52.740 --> 01:36:55.075
TO BE ABLE TO CREATE A STRONGER

01:36:55.142 --> 01:36:57.511
FOUNDATION OR SCALING UP OUR

01:36:57.578 --> 01:36:59.680
IMPACT SO THE FIRST ONE IS

01:36:59.747 --> 01:37:01.649
WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. WE HAVE

01:37:01.715 --> 01:37:04.251
BEEN SEEING PEOPLE. COMPETING

01:37:04.318 --> 01:37:05.653
FOR THE SAME WORKERS ON THE

01:37:05.719 --> 01:37:08.088
GROUND FOR THESE PROJECTS AND

01:37:08.155 --> 01:37:09.156
SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:37:09.223 --> 01:37:11.425
ACROSS THE SECTOR. THAT WE HAVE

01:37:11.492 --> 01:37:12.760
A WELL TRAINED AND FUNDED

01:37:12.826 --> 01:37:15.196
WORKFORCE READY TO DO THIS WORK

01:37:15.262 --> 01:37:16.830
AND GET OUT ON THE GROUND-

01:37:16.897 --> 01:37:18.399
ANOTHER AREA IS SMALL BUSINESS

01:37:18.465 --> 01:37:19.633
DEVELOPMENT. WE HAVE BEEN

01:37:19.700 --> 01:37:22.069
SEEING EVEN HIRING CONTRACTORS

01:37:22.136 --> 01:37:23.837
WERE SEEING A LACK OF ACCESS TO

01:37:23.904 --> 01:37:25.773
CAPITAL AND CAPITAL EQUIPMENT.

01:37:25.839 --> 01:37:27.875
IN THIS SECTOR SO ENSURING THAT

01:37:27.942 --> 01:37:29.210
WE HAVE BUSINESSES THAT CAN

01:37:29.276 --> 01:37:33.013
STEP IN AND- AND GET. ON THE

01:37:33.080 --> 01:37:34.381
GROUND IN MORE TRADITIONAL

01:37:34.448 --> 01:37:35.916
VEGETATION MANAGEMENT TOOLS.

01:37:35.983 --> 01:37:37.585
ALSO SMALL BUSINESSES STARTING

01:37:37.651 --> 01:37:39.286
UP AROUND THE QUESTION OF WHAT

01:37:39.353 --> 01:37:40.521
DO YOU DO WITH WHAT HE BY A

01:37:40.588 --> 01:37:41.922
MASKED COMING OUT OF THE

01:37:41.989 --> 01:37:43.324
SPENDING AND FUEL REDUCTION

01:37:43.390 --> 01:37:45.359
PROJECTS. INSURE THAT WE HAVE

01:37:45.426 --> 01:37:46.794
TOOLS TO TURN THAT INTO.

01:37:46.860 --> 01:37:48.596
GASIFICATION BIO DIESEL

01:37:48.662 --> 01:37:50.064
REPLACEMENT THAT WE'RE

01:37:50.130 --> 01:37:51.832
INVESTING IN INNOVATION I CAN

01:37:51.899 --> 01:37:53.500
ACTUALLY SEE BUSINESSES START

01:37:53.567 --> 01:37:55.302
UP AROUND THE SECTOR. AND THEN

01:37:55.369 --> 01:37:56.737
THE LAST AREA IS REALLY LOOKING

01:37:56.804 --> 01:37:58.205
AT PERMIT AND REGULATORY

01:37:58.272 --> 01:37:59.840
EFFICIENCIES. MOST OF THE

01:37:59.907 --> 01:38:01.909
PROJECTS THAT WE ARE DOING- IN

01:38:01.976 --> 01:38:04.078
THIS SECTOR REALLY HAVE DOUBLE

01:38:04.144 --> 01:38:05.779
ECOLOGICAL BENEFITS ON TOP OF

01:38:05.846 --> 01:38:07.815
THE PUBLIC SAFETY RETURNS. THAT

01:38:07.881 --> 01:38:09.383
THEY GIVE US AND SO MOST OF

01:38:09.450 --> 01:38:11.885
THIS IS REALLY POSITIVE. FOR

01:38:11.952 --> 01:38:14.288
OUR ECOLOGY AND OUR ENVIRONMENT

01:38:14.355 --> 01:38:16.156
AND SO THEREFORE WE WANT TO

01:38:16.223 --> 01:38:17.825
MAKE SURE THAT THESE ARE DNE.

01:38:17.891 --> 01:38:19.059
THAT WISELY BUT THAT WE ARE

01:38:19.126 --> 01:38:20.761
REALLY NOT CREATING

01:38:20.828 --> 01:38:23.230
BUREAUCRATIC LOADS ON THAT SO

01:38:23.297 --> 01:38:24.865
WE'VE ALSO INVESTED IN. HEALING

01:38:24.932 --> 01:38:26.567
UP REGULATORY EFFICIENCIES SO

01:38:26.634 --> 01:38:28.902
THAT WE CAN GET PEOPLE WORKING

01:38:28.969 --> 01:38:35.542
ON THE GROUND TO RESTORE. OUR

01:38:35.609 --> 01:38:37.344
ENVIRONMENT FASTER. THE WHAT DO

01:38:37.411 --> 01:38:39.146
FOR A FEW MINUTES- WHAT WHAT'S

01:38:39.213 --> 01:38:41.148
ACTUALLY N BY AND WHERE WE-

01:38:41.215 --> 01:38:43.150
OUT OF THIS STRATEGIC FOR. OF

01:38:43.217 --> 01:38:44.718
INVESTING IN COMMUNITY HARD ST

01:38:44.785 --> 01:38:47.321
FUEL BREAKS AND ALLOW. AND

01:38:47.388 --> 01:38:49.023
THOSE. FOUNDATION AREAS I MEANT

01:38:49.089 --> 01:38:51.258
AS WELL. SO THIS BILLION DOLLAR

01:38:51.325 --> 01:38:54.061
FRAMEWORK HAS THREE HUNDRED

01:38:54.128 --> 01:38:54.695
TWENTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS IN

01:38:54.762 --> 01:38:56.630
EARLY ACTION FUNDING AND THESE

01:38:56.697 --> 01:38:58.365
GOES TOWARDS PROGRAMS THAT ARE

01:38:58.432 --> 01:39:00.167
READY TO LAUNCH NOW. AND WE'LL

01:39:00.234 --> 01:39:02.202
BY ASKING EXTRA SEASON FIRE

01:39:02.269 --> 01:39:04.338
PROTECTION SO MOST OF THESE

01:39:04.405 --> 01:39:05.639
PROJECTS TAKING HERE SOME

01:39:05.706 --> 01:39:07.174
TEACHING OKAY IF WE START IN

01:39:07.241 --> 01:39:09.043
THE SPRING. RATHER THAN IN THE

01:39:09.109 --> 01:39:11.045
FALL- AS A NORMAL BUDGET CYCLE

01:39:11.111 --> 01:39:14.481
WOULD. BY FIRE PROTECTION. IN

01:39:14.548 --> 01:39:16.317
IN THE FOLLOWING SPRING WHICH

01:39:16.383 --> 01:39:18.285
MEANS WE BUY EXTRA SEASON OF

01:39:18.352 --> 01:39:19.920
FIRE PROTECTION OUT OF THOSE

01:39:19.987 --> 01:39:21.855
DOLLARS. WANTED SO WE REALLY

01:39:21.922 --> 01:39:22.623
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE

01:39:22.690 --> 01:39:23.991
ARE GOING TOWARDS ACTIVITIES

01:39:24.058 --> 01:39:26.593
THAT NEED TO START NOW- AND

01:39:26.660 --> 01:39:27.961
THAT WILL ADDRESS SOME OF THE

01:39:28.028 --> 01:39:30.331
STRATEGIC BARRIERS AS WELL- THE

01:39:30.397 --> 01:39:32.766
REMAINING BUDGET IS IN. BUDGET

01:39:32.833 --> 01:39:34.868
YEAR AND WE'VE ANTICIPATED

01:39:34.935 --> 01:39:37.037
PUTTING ON WE ARE REQUESTING A

01:39:37.104 --> 01:39:38.272
LONGER SPENDING WINDOW ON

01:39:38.339 --> 01:39:40.107
THOSE. THAT PROJECTS CAN REALLY

01:39:40.174 --> 01:39:41.975
GO START TO FINISH WITH THOSE

01:39:42.042 --> 01:39:43.844
DOLLARS- YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE

01:39:43.911 --> 01:39:46.146
OR SEEN PROJECTS- GET FUNDED IN

01:39:46.213 --> 01:39:47.881
PHASES OFTEN MEETINGS THREE

01:39:47.948 --> 01:39:49.616
YEARS BETWEEN GRANT. TO BE ABLE

01:39:49.683 --> 01:39:50.918
TO GET THE NEXT PHASE OF THE

01:39:50.984 --> 01:39:52.886
PROJECT DONE WHICH MEANS WE END

01:39:52.953 --> 01:39:54.188
UP WITH THE PATCHWORK ASPIRES

01:39:54.254 --> 01:39:55.522
MILLIONS ON THE LANDSCAPE WHICH

01:39:55.589 --> 01:39:56.990
CAME INTO PLAY THIS FIRE

01:39:57.057 --> 01:39:58.525
SEASON. YOU KNOW SHE FIRE FOR

01:39:58.592 --> 01:40:00.260
EXAMPLE THERE'S A PROJECT-

01:40:00.327 --> 01:40:01.395
PUNDITS SCARED ABOUT IT

01:40:01.462 --> 01:40:03.697
CONSERVANCY IN CALIFORNIA. THAT

01:40:03.764 --> 01:40:05.866
HAD AS ONE HAD BEEN COMPLETED

01:40:05.933 --> 01:40:07.801
THE ASHY FIREBURNED AN

01:40:07.868 --> 01:40:09.269
ECOLOGICAL HEALTHY LEVEL THE

01:40:09.336 --> 01:40:10.437
STREETS ARE STANDING THE HOMES

01:40:10.504 --> 01:40:12.439
REMAINS- BUT THE AREAS THAT

01:40:12.506 --> 01:40:14.541
WORK BASED HUMAN BREAKING- WAS

01:40:14.608 --> 01:40:16.176
A CATASTROPHIC FIRE HOMES WERE

01:40:16.243 --> 01:40:18.979
LOST AND ECOLOGY. ALSO I'M

01:40:19.046 --> 01:40:20.714
DEVASTATED IN THOSE AREAS AND

01:40:20.781 --> 01:40:22.483
SO WERE REALLY ONCE YOU. PUT

01:40:22.549 --> 01:40:24.818
THESE INVESTMENTS INTO A LONGER

01:40:24.885 --> 01:40:27.654
SPENDING WINDOW TO BE ABLE TO

01:40:27.721 --> 01:40:29.123
START AND FINISH PROJECTS

01:40:29.189 --> 01:40:39.666
COMPLETELY- SHOULD BE ABLE TO

01:40:39.733 --> 01:40:40.801
ACHIEVE THAT DEEPER REQUIRE

01:40:40.868 --> 01:40:45.005
RESILIENCE. SO IT WHEN MONDAY-

01:40:45.072 --> 01:40:45.806
A FIVE HUNDRED TWELVE MILLION

01:40:45.873 --> 01:40:47.474
THAT'LL SCALE RESEARCH AREA AND

01:40:47.541 --> 01:40:48.542
WE HAVE FUNDING ACROSS STREET

01:40:48.609 --> 01:40:49.710
REMEMBER LANDSCAPE WIDELY URBAN

01:40:49.777 --> 01:40:52.379
IN AND COMMUNITY HIGH. SO YES

01:40:52.446 --> 01:40:55.149
INCLUDE ONE ACROSS OWNERSHIP

01:40:55.215 --> 01:40:57.151
BECAUSE OUR ARE NOT AND

01:40:57.217 --> 01:40:59.520
JURISTIC BOUNDS AND SO I STRESS

01:40:59.586 --> 01:41:01.188
NEED TO IN THAT LAND IS

01:41:01.255 --> 01:41:03.624
INCLUDED WE THIS YEAR SIGNED A

01:41:03.690 --> 01:41:04.992
SHARED STOREKEEPER GREEN MET

01:41:05.058 --> 01:41:05.993
WITH THE U. S. FOREST SERVICE

01:41:06.059 --> 01:41:08.629
WHO OWNS 57% OF CALIFORNIANS

01:41:08.695 --> 01:41:10.597
FORCED IN WILD LANDS AND WE

01:41:10.664 --> 01:41:12.499
WANT TO ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE

01:41:12.566 --> 01:41:15.068
COMMITTED TO TREAT FIVE HUNDRED

01:41:15.135 --> 01:41:16.837
THOUSAND ACRES A YEAR- AND TO

01:41:16.904 --> 01:41:18.372
SCALE UP TO THAT BY TWENTY

01:41:18.439 --> 01:41:20.073
TWENTY FIVE. WE HAVE ALSO MATCH

01:41:20.140 --> 01:41:23.277
THAT COMMITMENT TREATING FIVE

01:41:23.343 --> 01:41:23.877
HUNDRED EIGHT THOUSAND ACRES A

01:41:23.944 --> 01:41:24.611
YEAR THIS IS A NUMBER THAT

01:41:24.678 --> 01:41:26.046
COMES FROM THE POOREST CARBON

01:41:26.113 --> 01:41:28.649
PLAN OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN IN THIS

01:41:28.715 --> 01:41:30.651
BUDGET WILL ENABLE US TO BE

01:41:30.717 --> 01:41:32.019
ABLE TO REACH THAT COLLECTIVE

01:41:32.085 --> 01:41:37.424
TARGET- OR TO REACH THE STATE.

01:41:37.491 --> 01:41:39.593
I HUNDRED MILLION FIVE THOUSAND

01:41:39.660 --> 01:41:40.527
EIGHT. BY- TO TWENTY SO IT

01:41:40.594 --> 01:41:42.129
ALLOWS US RESET TO YEARS OR-

01:41:42.196 --> 01:41:45.098
AND- WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS-

01:41:45.165 --> 01:41:46.433
INVESTMENTS ACROSS LAND

01:41:46.500 --> 01:41:48.402
OWNERSHIP TYPES OF STATE ON

01:41:48.469 --> 01:41:50.204
LANDS TRIBAL FUNDING AND SMALL

01:41:50.270 --> 01:41:51.805
FAMILY LANDOWNERS AND PRIVATE

01:41:51.872 --> 01:41:53.907
LANDS. SO THE STATE OWNED LANDS

01:41:53.974 --> 01:41:54.975
THAT THE STATE OWNED ABOUT

01:41:55.042 --> 01:41:56.310
THREE MILLION ACRES WHICH IS

01:41:56.376 --> 01:41:59.179
ABOUT 3% OF. OUR LAND OWNERSHIP

01:41:59.246 --> 01:42:01.648
IN THE CALIFORNIA WE HAVE

01:42:01.715 --> 01:42:02.416
EIGHTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS

01:42:02.483 --> 01:42:03.584
PROPOSED IN THIS BUDGET FOR

01:42:03.650 --> 01:42:05.786
STATE PARKS TO BE ABLE TO RAMP

01:42:05.853 --> 01:42:07.354
UP FROM TREATING. TWO THOUSAND

01:42:07.421 --> 01:42:09.022
ACRES HERE TO TWENTY FIVE

01:42:09.089 --> 01:42:10.858
THOUSAND ACRES YEAR WE HAVE A

01:42:10.924 --> 01:42:11.725
FORTY FIVE MINUTE THAT MILLION

01:42:11.792 --> 01:42:13.460
DOLLARS IDENTIFIED FOR

01:42:13.527 --> 01:42:14.127
DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND

01:42:14.194 --> 01:42:15.896
WILDLIFE. SO THEY CAN SCALE UP

01:42:15.963 --> 01:42:17.464
TO TREAT ABOUT FIFTEEN THOUSAND

01:42:17.531 --> 01:42:19.132
ACRES A YEAR THE PARTS IN

01:42:19.199 --> 01:42:20.501
QUESTION WILDLIFE BY THE WAY

01:42:20.567 --> 01:42:23.170
THIS YEAR LOST ABOUT A HUNDRED

01:42:23.237 --> 01:42:23.971
FORTY THOUSAND ACRES. IN THE

01:42:24.037 --> 01:42:25.839
FIRES IN TWENTY TWENTY AND THE

01:42:25.906 --> 01:42:27.107
STATE ROOMS ARE SET ASIDE

01:42:27.174 --> 01:42:28.175
BECAUSE THEY ARE RARE

01:42:28.242 --> 01:42:30.377
ECOSYSTEMS AND SOME CRITICAL

01:42:30.444 --> 01:42:31.712
HABITAT AND SO WE WANT TO

01:42:31.778 --> 01:42:33.847
ENSURE. THAT WE ARE CURRENTLY

01:42:33.914 --> 01:42:35.749
INVESTING IN A FIRE RESILIENCE

01:42:35.816 --> 01:42:37.684
ON STATE OWNED LANDS SO THAT

01:42:37.751 --> 01:42:39.686
THESE PLANTS CAN'T INDOOR AND

01:42:39.753 --> 01:42:40.754
WE ARE ALSO SETTING A HIGH

01:42:40.821 --> 01:42:42.623
STANDARD. I'M IN THE STATE ONLY

01:42:42.689 --> 01:42:44.391
CATEGORY WERE ALSO INVESTING

01:42:44.458 --> 01:42:45.526
TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS-

01:42:45.592 --> 01:42:46.894
PROPOSING TWELVE MILLION

01:42:46.960 --> 01:42:47.528
DOLLARS FOR THE TAHOE

01:42:47.594 --> 01:42:50.497
CONSERVANCY. THEY OWN SIXTY

01:42:50.564 --> 01:42:51.698
FIVE HUNDRED PLOTS AROUND THE

01:42:51.765 --> 01:42:54.201
TAHOE COMMUNITY AND SOME ANTI

01:42:54.268 --> 01:42:55.869
IN NEIGHBORHOODS AND SO WE WANT

01:42:55.936 --> 01:42:56.537
TO ENSURE THAT THEY AVE

01:42:56.603 --> 01:42:59.339
RESOURCES TO FULLY TREAT- THAT

01:42:59.406 --> 01:43:00.607
LANDHOLDING TO BE ABLE TO

01:43:00.674 --> 01:43:02.576
ENSURE SAFETY AND- RESILIENCE

01:43:02.643 --> 01:43:04.444
AROUND LAKE TAHOE. AND THE

01:43:04.511 --> 01:43:05.279
TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR

01:43:05.345 --> 01:43:06.780
STATE LANDS COMMISSION THOSE

01:43:06.847 --> 01:43:09.349
PLANS HAVE BEEN SET ASIDE BUT-

01:43:09.416 --> 01:43:10.884
THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ACTIVELY

01:43:10.951 --> 01:43:12.586
MANAGED AND SO THIS ALLOWS THE

01:43:12.653 --> 01:43:13.921
STATE LANDS COMMISSION TO BUILD

01:43:13.987 --> 01:43:15.689
A PROGRAM. THAT WILL START

01:43:15.756 --> 01:43:22.195
ACTIVELY MANAGING- OUR STATE

01:43:22.262 --> 01:43:23.263
LANDS. WE ALSO ENSURE WE'RE

01:43:23.330 --> 01:43:25.132
GIVE FUND TO TRY SOME HAVE.

01:43:25.198 --> 01:43:27.301
BEEN FUNDING AND- THROUGH- THE

01:43:27.367 --> 01:43:30.404
COR. ARE GRANT AND- WE- BUT

01:43:30.470 --> 01:43:31.672
WE'VE BEEN HEARING FEEDBACK

01:43:31.738 --> 01:43:32.839
FROM OUR TRAVEL PARTNERS AND

01:43:32.906 --> 01:43:35.309
THAT. IT IS DIFFICULT TO ACCESS

01:43:35.375 --> 01:43:38.512
THAT- AND THEN THERE ARE SOME

01:43:38.579 --> 01:43:40.213
AREAS THAT WE CAN IMPROVE IN

01:43:40.280 --> 01:43:43.550
TERMS OF- SOCIAL JUSTICE AND

01:43:43.617 --> 01:43:44.885
EQUITY WE HAD OUR TRAVEL

01:43:44.952 --> 01:43:46.286
PARTNERS AND SO. WE'VE

01:43:46.353 --> 01:43:47.487
IDENTIFIED TWENTY MILLION

01:43:47.554 --> 01:43:49.089
DOLLARS THAT IS FAIRLY FLEXIBLE

01:43:49.156 --> 01:43:50.490
BUT WE ARE ALLOWING TRIBES TO

01:43:50.557 --> 01:43:52.292
TELL US. HOW TO BE ABLE TO

01:43:52.359 --> 01:43:54.328
INVEST THESE DOLLARS IN A WAY

01:43:54.394 --> 01:43:56.964
THAT IS FAIR EQUITABLE AND JUST

01:43:57.030 --> 01:44:00.200
AND GIVES THEM TO. RESOURCES

01:44:00.267 --> 01:44:01.401
ASSEMBLY MANAGE THEIR LAN

01:44:01.468 --> 01:44:02.636
WITHOUT A LOT OF ADMINISTRATIVE

01:44:02.703 --> 01:44:05.005
BURDEN FROM THE STATE. WE ALSO

01:44:05.072 --> 01:44:06.473
ARE INCORPORATING FUNDING

01:44:06.540 --> 01:44:08.108
INCREASING FUNDING FOR SMALL

01:44:08.175 --> 01:44:10.644
FAMILY LANDOWNERS THIS IS ABOUT

01:44:10.711 --> 01:44:12.479
26% OF THE LAND OWNERSHIP IN

01:44:12.546 --> 01:44:14.147
CALIFORNIA. AND MOST OF THESE

01:44:14.214 --> 01:44:16.249
LANDOWNERS ARE LAND RICH BUT

01:44:16.316 --> 01:44:18.885
CASH POOR AND SO WE'VE INCLUDED

01:44:18.952 --> 01:44:20.487
FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE

01:44:20.554 --> 01:44:21.855
CALIFORNIA FORCED TO PROVE THAT

01:44:21.922 --> 01:44:24.091
PROGRAM. WHICH GIVES GRANTS TO

01:44:24.157 --> 01:44:26.226
SMALL FAMILY LANDOWNERS TO BE

01:44:26.293 --> 01:44:27.260
ABLE TO ACTIVELY MANAGE THEIR

01:44:27.327 --> 01:44:29.529
LANDS THE ADDED BENEFIT OF THIS

01:44:29.596 --> 01:44:31.164
PROGRAM IS THAT WE HAVE SEEN

01:44:31.231 --> 01:44:32.332
THAT MANY FAMILY LANDOWNERS.

01:44:32.399 --> 01:44:34.234
OFTEN SELL THEIR LAND BECAUSE

01:44:34.301 --> 01:44:35.802
THEY CANNOT MAINTAIN THAT SO

01:44:35.869 --> 01:44:37.371
GIVEN THE RESOURCES TO CREATE

01:44:37.437 --> 01:44:39.706
FIRE RESILIENCE AND ECOLOGICAL

01:44:39.773 --> 01:44:41.875
RESILIENCE ON THIS LANDSCAPE.

01:44:41.942 --> 01:44:44.811
ALLOWS US TO BE ABLE TO. HELP

01:44:44.878 --> 01:44:46.246
PREVENT FAMILY LANDOWNERS FROM

01:44:46.313 --> 01:44:48.081
SELLING THEIR LAND AND HOW THEY

01:44:48.148 --> 01:44:51.685
GET CONVERTED AWAY FROM FOREST

01:44:51.752 --> 01:44:55.856
ECOLOGY. WE'RE ALSO INVEST IN-

01:44:55.922 --> 01:44:57.991
INDUSTRIAL LANDOWNER SIDE FOR

01:44:58.058 --> 01:44:59.626
THE FOREST LEGACY PROGRAM

01:44:59.693 --> 01:45:01.995
PROVIDES- FUNDING FOR LARGER

01:45:02.062 --> 01:45:03.797
LANDOWNERS YOU'LL BE ABLE TO

01:45:03.864 --> 01:45:06.033
COMMIT TO CREATE CONSERVATION

01:45:06.099 --> 01:45:08.101
EASEMENTS TO PREVENT THEIR LAND

01:45:08.168 --> 01:45:10.137
FROM GETTING CONVERTED- AND SO

01:45:10.203 --> 01:45:11.705
THIS ALLOWS US TO ENSURE THAT

01:45:11.772 --> 01:45:13.540
WE ARE SUSTAINING AND RETAIN

01:45:13.607 --> 01:45:16.443
RETAINING LARGER SWATCH OF-

01:45:16.510 --> 01:45:20.480
ECOSYSTEMS IN THE STATE- AND

01:45:20.547 --> 01:45:22.249
THEN WE ALSO ARE CONTINUING ARE

01:45:22.315 --> 01:45:24.351
FORCED HEALTH GRANTS A HUNDRED

01:45:24.418 --> 01:45:25.752
SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR

01:45:25.819 --> 01:45:27.654
FOREST HEALTH GRANTS- WHICH CAN

01:45:27.721 --> 01:45:29.723
THEN BE DETERMINED BY REGIONS

01:45:29.790 --> 01:45:31.825
AND COMMUNITIES APPLY FOR THOSE

01:45:31.892 --> 01:45:33.260
GRANTS AND THEY GET ON THE

01:45:33.326 --> 01:45:35.228
LANDSCAPE. AND THEN WE ARE

01:45:35.295 --> 01:45:37.164
STARTING TO SHIFT TOWARDS THIS

01:45:37.230 --> 01:45:39.633
REGIONAL- FRAMEWORK TO ENSURE

01:45:39.700 --> 01:45:40.934
THAT REGIONS ARE IN THE

01:45:41.001 --> 01:45:42.135
DRIVER'S SEAT AND THAT WE ARE

01:45:42.202 --> 01:45:44.271
THAT GIVING BLOCK GRANTS TO THE

01:45:44.337 --> 01:45:46.139
REGIONS TO BE ABLE TO EXECUTE

01:45:46.206 --> 01:45:48.542
CONCENTRATIONS ARE- WHAT WE

01:45:48.608 --> 01:45:50.577
CALL THEIR PROJECT TYPE PLANS

01:45:50.644 --> 01:45:51.111
WHAT WE CALL QUOTE UNQUOTE

01:45:51.178 --> 01:45:53.647
SHOVEL READY PROJECTS- AND SO

01:45:53.714 --> 01:45:54.715
ONE OF THE FIRST REGION'S WERE

01:45:54.781 --> 01:45:56.316
ROLLING OUT WE IS THIS YOUR

01:45:56.383 --> 01:45:58.018
NEVADA CONSERVANCY THIS YEAR

01:45:58.085 --> 01:46:00.654
NOT THAT REPRESENTS- EIGHT

01:46:00.721 --> 01:46:03.523
EIGHT IT. IS HOME 260% OF

01:46:03.590 --> 01:46:04.758
CALIFORNIA'S WATER COMES FROM

01:46:04.825 --> 01:46:08.395
THIS YEAR NEVADA- AND IT IS 74%

01:46:08.462 --> 01:46:09.563
OF THIS YEAR NEVADA IS A HIGH

01:46:09.629 --> 01:46:11.598
FIRE RISK ZONE A QUARTER OF

01:46:11.665 --> 01:46:12.899
THIS YEAR ABOUT A BIRD LAST

01:46:12.966 --> 01:46:14.201
YEAR ON THE CINEMATIC

01:46:14.267 --> 01:46:16.536
CONSERVANCY HAS IDENTIFIED OVER

01:46:16.603 --> 01:46:18.271
HUNDRED SHOVEL READY PROJECTS

01:46:18.338 --> 01:46:19.406
THEY'VE DESIGNED A REGIONAL

01:46:19.473 --> 01:46:21.174
STRATEGY AND A REGIONAL PLAN

01:46:21.241 --> 01:46:22.542
THAT HAS INCORPORATED REGIONAL

01:46:22.609 --> 01:46:24.678
PARTNERS AND SO IDENTIFYING

01:46:24.745 --> 01:46:25.746
SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS THIS

01:46:25.812 --> 01:46:27.748
YEAR NEVADA CONSERVANCY YOU

01:46:27.814 --> 01:46:29.983
START THOSE PROGRAMS. AND TO BE

01:46:30.050 --> 01:46:30.917
ABLE TO HAVE A LARGER

01:46:30.984 --> 01:46:32.686
COLLECTIVE IMPACT THAT WILL

01:46:32.753 --> 01:46:33.820
HELP US NOT ONLY PREVENT

01:46:33.887 --> 01:46:35.822
CATASTROPHIC FIRES BUT MITIGATE

01:46:35.889 --> 01:46:37.424
THE IMPACTS OF DROUGHT FROM

01:46:37.491 --> 01:46:39.559
HAVING THOSE WATERSHEDS LOST-

01:46:39.626 --> 01:46:48.401
AND SO THIS IS REALLY. A

01:46:48.468 --> 01:46:49.302
CRUCIAL FUNDING AS WELL. WE'RE

01:46:49.369 --> 01:46:51.138
ALSO GOING- ST SHE FUEL BREAKS

01:46:51.204 --> 01:46:52.672
AND WE- URBAN INTERFACE- PRO.

01:46:52.739 --> 01:46:54.708
THIS INCLUDE OUR CALVET- CRUISE

01:46:54.775 --> 01:46:56.810
CAL- IS ANTICIPATED INCREASE.

01:46:56.877 --> 01:46:58.945
THEIR THEIR AND NOW OF GILBERT

SAID THEY THEM LIKE. YOU ARE-

01:47:03.817 --> 01:47:04.317
FORTY FIVE TO SIXTY A YEAR

01:47:04.384 --> 01:47:05.452
DEPENDING ON THE SIZE OF THE

01:47:05.519 --> 01:47:06.987
PROJECT AND SO THIS ALLOWS THEM

01:47:07.053 --> 01:47:08.388
TO SCALE UP AND GET SOME CREWS

01:47:08.455 --> 01:47:09.956
TO DO THE JOB. THIS ALSO

01:47:10.023 --> 01:47:11.458
INCLUDES A HUNDRED THIRTY

01:47:11.525 --> 01:47:12.893
MILLION DOLLARS FOR OUR

01:47:12.959 --> 01:47:16.096
PROXMIRE PREVENTION GRANT. AND

01:47:16.163 --> 01:47:18.298
EASY- THESE GRANTS CAN BE USED

01:47:18.365 --> 01:47:19.633
BURKE- FUEL BREAKS AND

01:47:19.699 --> 01:47:20.667
HARDENING IT'S REALLY UP TO

01:47:20.734 --> 01:47:22.769
COMMUNITIES YOU DECIDE HOW THEY

01:47:22.836 --> 01:47:24.938
USE THEM- BUT BY. WE'RE ALSO

01:47:25.005 --> 01:47:26.373
INCREASING THE WORKFORCE TO BE

01:47:26.439 --> 01:47:28.441
ABLE TO EXECUTE BOTH. THESE

01:47:28.508 --> 01:47:30.210
VEGETATION THINNING PROJECTS-

01:47:30.277 --> 01:47:32.612
AND- TO BE ABLE TO GET TO A

01:47:32.679 --> 01:47:34.614
POINT AND TO BE ABLE TO DO YOUR

01:47:34.681 --> 01:47:35.549
FORCED TO WORK SO WE'RE

01:47:35.615 --> 01:47:36.583
INCLUDING TWENTY MILLION

01:47:36.650 --> 01:47:38.819
DOLLARS FOR THE FORESTRY CORP-

01:47:38.885 --> 01:47:39.619
FROM THE CALIFORNIA

01:47:39.686 --> 01:47:41.321
CONSERVATION CORPS. AND FIFTY

01:47:41.388 --> 01:47:42.255
MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE

01:47:42.322 --> 01:47:45.225
CALIFORNIA- HAND CREWS AND TO

01:47:45.292 --> 01:47:46.860
BE ABLE TO DO THIS WORK. I AM A

01:47:46.927 --> 01:47:48.461
REALLY FOCUSED ON COMMUNITY

01:47:48.528 --> 01:47:51.298
HARDENING AND HOME HARDENING

01:47:51.364 --> 01:47:53.233
AND WE SEE HOME HARDENING- BUT

01:47:53.300 --> 01:47:55.001
WE HAVE. AN ESTIMATED TWO

01:47:55.068 --> 01:47:56.269
MILLION HOMES ACCORDING TO THE

01:47:56.336 --> 01:47:57.904
CALIFORNIA FIRE SAFE COUNCILS

01:47:57.971 --> 01:47:59.940
IN HIGH FIRE RISK ZONES THAT

01:48:00.006 --> 01:48:00.907
ARE IN NEED OF HOMES HARDENING

01:48:00.974 --> 01:48:03.176
RETROFITS AND DEFENSIBLE SPACE.

01:48:03.243 --> 01:48:05.679
TO BE ABLE TO WITHSTAND FIRES

01:48:05.745 --> 01:48:07.914
AND ACHIEVE THAT- HOME

01:48:07.981 --> 01:48:09.549
HARDENING LEVEL WE'VE TAKEN

01:48:09.616 --> 01:48:12.018
SOME STEPS IN THIS DIRECTION IN

01:48:12.085 --> 01:48:12.586
TWO THOUSAND EIGHT THE FIRE

01:48:12.652 --> 01:48:14.487
MARSHAL CHANGED. HE WOULD BE

01:48:14.554 --> 01:48:16.223
UPDATED BEAT THAT CALIFORNIA

01:48:16.289 --> 01:48:18.592
FIRE CODES YOU INCORPORATE HOME

01:48:18.658 --> 01:48:19.893
HARDENING STANDARDS AND WE

01:48:19.960 --> 01:48:21.494
SIGNED THAT AND PARADISE FOR

01:48:21.561 --> 01:48:23.463
EXAMPLE HOMES BUILT WOULD BE

01:48:23.530 --> 01:48:25.498
HIGHER UP HIGHER STANDARDS THAT

01:48:25.565 --> 01:48:26.466
ANY CLICK ON CORPORATE HOME

01:48:26.533 --> 01:48:29.302
GARDENING. A 60% PERCENT

01:48:29.369 --> 01:48:30.637
SURVIVAL RATE IN THE CAMPFIRE

01:48:30.704 --> 01:48:32.505
VERSUS THE 10% SURVIVAL RATE OF

01:48:32.572 --> 01:48:34.875
HOMES BUILT BEFORE TWO THOUSAND

01:48:34.941 --> 01:48:35.909
EIGHT WITHOUT THOSE STANDARDS.

01:48:35.976 --> 01:48:37.644
SO WE'RE SEEING SOME INCREASE

01:48:37.711 --> 01:48:39.646
IN SURVIVABILITY AT WITH THESE

01:48:39.713 --> 01:48:50.624
NEWER HOMES BUTIT'S REALLY.

01:48:50.690 --> 01:48:51.157
IMPORTANT TO BE ABLE TO DO

01:48:51.224 --> 01:48:52.425
THOSE RHETORIC THAT I'M HARD WE

01:48:52.492 --> 01:48:54.761
CAN H. THROUGH AND OUTREACH TO.

01:48:54.828 --> 01:48:56.229
THAT CAN AFFORD TO MAKE THESE

01:48:56.296 --> 01:48:57.297
CHANGES WE'VE INCREASED BY FOR

01:48:57.364 --> 01:48:58.465
THE- SPACE INSPECT AS YOU JUST

01:48:58.531 --> 01:49:02.135
GOT. AND WE'RE ALSO FUND FOR-

01:49:02.202 --> 01:49:04.204
OR DO YOU SEE FIVE ADVISOR WHO

01:49:04.271 --> 01:49:06.039
ARE CHRIS PARTNER. OR DOING

01:49:06.106 --> 01:49:07.340
THAT EDUCATION OUTREACH TO COME.

01:49:07.407 --> 01:49:09.442
AND WE'RE AT WE'RE LAUNCHING A

01:49:09.509 --> 01:49:10.911
PILOT PROGRAM TO BE ABLE HELP

01:49:10.977 --> 01:49:12.345
HOMEOWNERS THAT CAN AFFORD TO

01:49:12.412 --> 01:49:14.781
MAKE THESE RICHARD. RECHECK SO

01:49:14.848 --> 01:49:16.016
THAT TWENTY MILLION DOLLAR

01:49:16.082 --> 01:49:17.584
INVESTMENT FROM THE STATE WHICH

01:49:17.651 --> 01:49:19.386
WILL HELP US LEVERAGE SEVENTY

01:49:19.452 --> 01:49:20.854
FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FROM FEMA

01:49:20.921 --> 01:49:22.756
MITIGATION GRANTS THIS WOULD BE

01:49:22.822 --> 01:49:24.524
A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR PILOT

01:49:24.591 --> 01:49:26.793
PROJECT TO BE ABLE TO TRULY

01:49:26.860 --> 01:49:29.329
LAUNCH- HOME HARDENING EFFORTS

01:49:29.396 --> 01:49:31.598
AND FEDERAL COMMITMENTS UNDER

01:49:31.665 --> 01:49:32.599
EIGHTY THIRTY EIGHT. SO OUR

01:49:32.666 --> 01:49:35.135
GOAL IS TO BE ABLE TO ENSURE

01:49:35.201 --> 01:49:36.836
THAT WE ARE WE ARE SO AS YOU

01:49:36.903 --> 01:49:37.871
CAN SEE THIS BUDGET WE ARE

01:49:37.938 --> 01:49:39.940
STEALING. AREAS THAT WE HAVE

01:49:40.006 --> 01:49:41.508
BEEN ALREADY WORKING IN

01:49:41.574 --> 01:49:43.977
ACTIVELY AND PROACTIVELY AND WE

01:49:44.044 --> 01:49:45.879
ARE LAUNCHING A PILOT FOR HOME

01:49:45.946 --> 01:49:46.947
HARDENING WHICH IS A CRUCIAL

01:49:47.013 --> 01:49:49.616
PART OF THIS- REQUIRE

01:49:49.683 --> 01:49:51.751
RESILIENCE STRATEGY- AND IT

01:49:51.818 --> 01:49:53.720
NEEDS TO START AND SO THIS IS

01:49:53.787 --> 01:49:55.522
REALLY SCALING IT UP. IN THE

01:49:55.588 --> 01:49:56.489
RIGHT WAY AND CREATING A

01:49:56.556 --> 01:50:01.695
FOUNDATION. TO SCALE FURTHER.

01:50:01.761 --> 01:50:04.264
NOW I'M- BY- COUNTY AREAS- I

01:50:04.331 --> 01:50:06.066
MET- OUR REGION SITE BASED

01:50:06.132 --> 01:50:08.902
MANAGEMENT REMOVING BARRIERS-

01:50:08.969 --> 01:50:10.036
TO BE ABLE TO INCREASE

01:50:10.103 --> 01:50:10.737
WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT

01:50:10.804 --> 01:50:14.207
BUSINESSES. AND AND PERMITTING

01:50:14.274 --> 01:50:16.676
REFORM SO THE REGIONAL PART IS

01:50:16.743 --> 01:50:18.311
REALLY CRUCIAL FOR EVERYBODY TO

01:50:18.378 --> 01:50:20.613
UNDERSTAND BECAUSE THIS IS THE

01:50:20.680 --> 01:50:22.349
AREA THAT ALLOWS US TO TAKE.

01:50:22.415 --> 01:50:23.650
THE THREE HUNDRED MILLION

01:50:23.717 --> 01:50:26.219
DOLLARS IN GRANTS ACROSS OUR

01:50:26.286 --> 01:50:27.120
FOREST HEALTH AND FIRE

01:50:27.187 --> 01:50:29.255
PREVENTION ACTIVITIES PROPOSED

01:50:29.322 --> 01:50:30.857
IN THIS BUDGET. AND ENSURE THAT

01:50:30.924 --> 01:50:32.158
THEY ARE STRATEGICALLY MEETING

01:50:32.225 --> 01:50:34.794
THE GOALS OF THE REGION. SO

01:50:34.861 --> 01:50:36.730
THIS INCLUDES EIGHTY FIVE

01:50:36.796 --> 01:50:37.630
MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE

01:50:37.697 --> 01:50:38.832
REGIONAL POOREST AND FIRE

01:50:38.898 --> 01:50:41.668
CAPACITY PROGRAM WHICH ALLOWS

01:50:41.735 --> 01:50:43.803
REGION'S JUNE BRING MULTIPLE

01:50:43.870 --> 01:50:45.238
STAKEHOLDERS TO THE TABLE. IT

01:50:45.305 --> 01:50:47.540
PROVIDES DOLLARS FOR REGIONAL

01:50:47.607 --> 01:50:48.274
PLANNING AND PROJECT

01:50:48.341 --> 01:50:54.748
PREPARATION. AND- AND- I WINDS

01:50:54.814 --> 01:50:56.483
OF READY REGION TO BE ABLE TO

01:50:56.549 --> 01:50:57.550
GET OUT THE DOOR WE HAVE THIS

01:50:57.617 --> 01:51:01.254
BE IN. IMPACT PROGRAM ALREADY

01:51:01.321 --> 01:51:03.123
FUNDED ACTIVITIES AND REGIONAL

01:51:03.189 --> 01:51:05.125
STRATEGIES- NORTH COAST

01:51:05.191 --> 01:51:06.226
REGIONAL PARTNERSHIP FOR

01:51:06.292 --> 01:51:08.728
EXAMPLE IT'S FUNDING AND- AS

01:51:08.795 --> 01:51:10.330
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA OUR

01:51:10.397 --> 01:51:12.265
REGIONAL ACTIVITIES BURKE SANTA

01:51:12.332 --> 01:51:13.133
MONICA MOUNTAINS CONSERVANCY

01:51:13.199 --> 01:51:16.136
AND DOWN IN SAN DIEGO AS WELL

01:51:16.202 --> 01:51:17.871
AND- AND IN THIS YEAR AND ABOUT

01:51:17.937 --> 01:51:20.006
AS WELL. AND SO THIS EIGHTY

01:51:20.073 --> 01:51:21.274
FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR NOT

01:51:21.341 --> 01:51:23.176
ONLY ALLOW US TO BUILD ON THE

01:51:23.243 --> 01:51:24.144
COLLABORATIVE REGIONAL

01:51:24.210 --> 01:51:26.046
STRATEGIES- AND PLANNING THAT

01:51:26.112 --> 01:51:28.548
HAS ALREADY BEEN ESTABLISHED

01:51:28.615 --> 01:51:30.016
BUT EXPERIENCE YOU FIVE NEW-

01:51:30.083 --> 01:51:32.419
SPECIFIC REGIONS INCLUDING

01:51:32.485 --> 01:51:33.453
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA LAKE

01:51:33.520 --> 01:51:34.988
COUNTY. WHERE YOU'RE SACRAMENTO

01:51:35.055 --> 01:51:36.689
REGION NAPA COUNTY AND SHASTA

01:51:36.756 --> 01:51:38.825
COUNTY SO THIS WOULD ALLOW US

01:51:38.892 --> 01:51:39.859
TO HAVE THEM AND ALL OF THE

01:51:39.926 --> 01:51:41.528
FIRE- PRONE REGIONS OF THE

01:51:41.594 --> 01:51:43.696
STATE COVERED BY EAST REGIONAL

01:51:43.763 --> 01:51:46.066
COLLABORATIVE. AND THIS IS ONE

01:51:46.132 --> 01:51:46.866
OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES WE

01:51:46.933 --> 01:51:47.967
HAVE BEEN HEARING FROM OUR

01:51:48.034 --> 01:51:50.437
GRANTEES AND- AND A CONCERN

01:51:50.503 --> 01:51:52.072
WE'VE BEEN GETTING FROM REGIONS

01:51:52.138 --> 01:51:53.973
THROUGHOUT THE STATE THAT THEY

01:51:54.040 --> 01:51:55.375
ARE NOT GETTING THE DOLLARS TO

01:51:55.442 --> 01:51:57.377
PLANT THAT ARE GRANT DOLLARS

01:51:57.444 --> 01:51:59.646
TEND TO GO TOWARDS AREAS. THAT

01:51:59.712 --> 01:52:01.214
AND COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE GRANT

01:52:01.281 --> 01:52:03.316
WRITING CAPACITY RATHER THAN

01:52:03.383 --> 01:52:05.485
THE LARGEST- FIRED NEEDS AND SO

01:52:05.552 --> 01:52:07.587
WHAT THIS IS DOING IS GIVING

01:52:07.654 --> 01:52:09.089
THEM THE TOOLS TO DESIGN A

01:52:09.155 --> 01:52:11.291
COHESIVE REGIONAL STRATEGIES.

01:52:11.357 --> 01:52:13.726
AND SHOULD BE ABLE TO THEN GET

01:52:13.793 --> 01:52:15.628
PROJECTS- PIPELINE AND SHOVEL

01:52:15.695 --> 01:52:17.330
READY TO BE ABLE TO GET OUT THE

01:52:17.397 --> 01:52:19.332
DOOR- AND I'LL JUST MAKE A FEW

01:52:19.399 --> 01:52:20.633
MORE MINUTES TO GO TO THE RIGHT

01:52:20.700 --> 01:52:21.701
AND THEN I'M GOING TO BE

01:52:21.768 --> 01:52:23.670
DELIGHTED TO ANSWER QUESTIONS.

01:52:23.736 --> 01:52:26.306
SO WE ALSO WANT TO ENSURE THAT

01:52:26.372 --> 01:52:27.507
THIS IS SCIENCE BASED

01:52:27.574 --> 01:52:28.808
MANAGEMENT THAT WAS ONE OF OUR

IN BEFORE- BECAUSE HE- ASKED

01:53:44.217 --> 01:53:45.285
FOR TEACHING FOR BREAKS WERE

01:53:45.351 --> 01:53:47.287
DESIGNED IN A WAY. THAT WAS

01:53:47.353 --> 01:53:48.988
MORE TO THE ECOLOGY THERE WERE

TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND SQUARE

01:53:58.698 --> 01:54:00.833
MILES OF LIDAR AND WE

LIKE HE CALIFORNIA. AND DON'T

01:55:14.774 --> 01:55:16.175
SEE I JUST KNOW THE AKRON CHIPS

01:55:16.242 --> 01:55:17.844
PROGRAM- THINK THAT IT WAS JUST

01:55:17.910 --> 01:55:20.446

HELPS TRAIN THE TRIBES. IN THE

01:55:34.427 --> 01:55:35.995
BASIC VEGETATION MANAGEMENT AND

01:55:36.062 --> 01:55:37.597
PRESCRIBED FIRE AND NAY THEN

01:55:37.664 --> 01:55:39.432
ARE HIRED AS THE WORK FORCE

01:55:39.499 --> 01:55:41.601
CREW OR THOSE COUNTIES. WE SAW

01:55:41.668 --> 01:55:43.670
IT PERCENT DECREASE IN

LARGER DIAMETER WOULD THAT

01:56:24.977 --> 01:56:26.279
COULD BE PUT INTO BUILDING SO

01:56:26.346 --> 01:56:28.247
TREES ARE GETTING LANDFILLED OR

01:56:28.314 --> 01:56:29.716
BURNED. BECAUSE THERE'S NOT

01:56:29.782 --> 01:56:31.851

TENSION 4% WILL INTORATES ON

01:57:20.233 --> 01:57:22.668
THE LOANS SO THE CLIMATE WAS

01:57:22.735 --> 01:57:23.236

BUT SURELY THERE ARE ADDITIONAL

02:03:34.640 --> 02:03:35.374
QUESTIONS THAT I THINK WE'VE

02:03:35.441 --> 02:03:36.942
ASKED THAT- AND I'M SURE

02:03:37.009 --> 02:03:37.543

THE LEGISLATURE. SO WITHOUT A

02:03:52.658 --> 02:03:54.660
FEW. KEY HIGH LEVEL COMMENTS

02:03:54.727 --> 02:03:56.562
FOR YOU FIRST OF ALL. WE THINK

02:03:56.629 --> 02:03:57.997
IT'S IMPORTANT KNOWLEDGE THAT

02:03:58.063 --> 02:04:00.533
THIS PACKAGE- HAS A LOT. OF

02:04:00.599 --> 02:04:03.102
AMERICANS THAT THE FOCUSED ON

02:04:03.169 --> 02:04:05.371
PREVENTION AND MITIGATION. IT

02:04:05.437 --> 02:04:06.672
WE THINK IT'S VERY MERITED-

02:04:06.739 --> 02:04:08.407
THAT GIVEN NOT ONLY THE

02:04:08.474 --> 02:04:10.476
SEVEREST OF BUYERS LAST YEAR

02:04:10.543 --> 02:04:12.077
THE LAST THREE OF THE LAST FOUR

02:04:12.144 --> 02:04:13.345
YEARS HAVE BEEN AMONG THE WORST

02:04:13.412 --> 02:04:15.014
IN. RECORDED HISTORY IN THE

02:04:15.080 --> 02:04:16.549
LAST TWO DECADES HAVE BEEN A-

02:04:16.615 --> 02:04:18.584
SOME OF THE WORST DECADE FOR-

02:04:18.651 --> 02:04:19.885
FIRE DAMAGE. IN RECORDED

02:04:19.952 --> 02:04:21.187
HISTORY IN THE STATE SO WE

02:04:21.253 --> 02:04:23.088
THINK THIS ADDITIONAL FOCUS ON

02:04:23.155 --> 02:04:24.390
PREVENTION MITIGATION MAKES

02:04:24.456 --> 02:04:27.293
SENSE BUILT ON. THE EFFORTS OF

02:04:27.359 --> 02:04:28.260
THE LEGISLATURE IN SB NINE

02:04:28.327 --> 02:04:30.763
ALIGN. EVERYTHING ALSO HAVING.

02:04:30.830 --> 02:04:32.531
A VARIED MIX OF STRATEGIES

02:04:32.598 --> 02:04:34.333
MAKES A LOT OF SENSE- YOU HEARD

02:04:34.400 --> 02:04:35.601
MISS MORRIS TALK ABOUT THE

02:04:35.668 --> 02:04:38.070
WIDER RANGE OF. RISKS INVOLVED

02:04:38.137 --> 02:04:39.805
AND SO WE THINK HAVING A-

02:04:39.872 --> 02:04:40.573
HAVING THESE DIFFERENT

02:04:40.639 --> 02:04:41.607
STRATEGIES THAT ARE TARGETED

02:04:41.674 --> 02:04:43.209
SOME OF THOSE DIFFERENT RISKS-

02:04:43.275 --> 02:04:45.377
MAKES A LOT OF SENSE. THAT SAID

02:04:45.444 --> 02:04:46.779
IT WOULD CERTAINLY THIS PACKAGE

02:04:46.846 --> 02:04:47.913
IS NOT THE ONLY WAY YOU COULD

02:04:47.980 --> 02:04:49.782
STRUCTURE OF. RESILIENCE

02:04:49.849 --> 02:04:51.350
PACKAGE AND SO WE HAVE A FEW

02:04:51.417 --> 02:04:53.018
COMMENTS FOR YOU TO CONSIDER.

02:04:53.085 --> 02:04:55.487
AS YOU AS YOU MOVE FORWARD. ONE

02:04:55.554 --> 02:04:57.256
IS THAT NOTING THAT ABOUT TWO

02:04:57.323 --> 02:04:58.724
THIRDS OF THE PACKAGE WILL BE

02:04:58.791 --> 02:05:00.759
FUNDED FROM GENERAL FUND. AND

02:05:00.826 --> 02:05:01.861
IT'S ONE TIME GENERAL FUND

02:05:01.927 --> 02:05:04.463
SPENDING. FIVE NOW YOU HEARD ME

02:05:04.530 --> 02:05:06.265
MENTION EARLIER SOME CONCERNS

02:05:06.332 --> 02:05:07.666
AT OUR OFFICE IN FINANCIAL

02:05:07.733 --> 02:05:09.268
PROJECTED MULTI YEAR BUDGET

02:05:09.335 --> 02:05:10.803
DEFICIT FOR THE GENERAL FUND IN

02:05:10.870 --> 02:05:11.770
THE FUTURE SO. I THINK IT'S

02:05:11.837 --> 02:05:12.571
IMPORTANT TO YOU KNOW WE

02:05:12.638 --> 02:05:13.138
APPRECIATE THAT THE

02:05:13.205 --> 02:05:14.540

02:05:14.607 --> 02:05:15.975
ONE TIME SPENDING. GIVEN

WITHOUT YOUR FISCAL CONCERNS.

02:05:17.776 --> 02:05:18.510
BUT OF COURSE THIS IS

02:05:18.577 --> 02:05:19.311
CHALLENGING BECAUSE THE

02:05:19.378 --> 02:05:20.880
WILDFIRE PROBLEM IS NOT A ONE

02:05:20.946 --> 02:05:22.648
TIME PROBLEM IN THE SCALE OF

02:05:22.715 --> 02:05:25.217
THE PROBLEM. IS SO LARGE IS IT

02:05:25.284 --> 02:05:26.952
NOT CAN BE ADDRESSED. BY THIS

02:05:27.019 --> 02:05:28.854
PACKAGE ALONE. INTO THAT SIMPLY

02:05:28.921 --> 02:05:30.356
TO SUGGEST THAT THE COMMITTEE.

02:05:30.422 --> 02:05:32.091
IN THE LEGISLATURE WE THINK

02:05:32.157 --> 02:05:32.691
WE'LL WANT TO ENGAGE WITH THE

02:05:32.758 --> 02:05:34.260
ADMINISTRATION. I THINK ABOUT

02:05:34.326 --> 02:05:35.961
WHAT A LONGER TERM STRATEGY IT

02:05:36.028 --> 02:05:37.096
WOULD LOOK LIKE IF THIS MAY BE

02:05:37.162 --> 02:05:38.697
THE FIRST STEP OR SOME. SOME

02:05:38.764 --> 02:05:40.199
PACKAGE- APPROVE THIS YEAR

02:05:40.266 --> 02:05:42.635
COULD BE A FIRST STEP BUT- WE

02:05:42.701 --> 02:05:43.769
THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE TO ALSO

02:05:43.836 --> 02:05:44.737
THINK ABOUT WHAT WHAT WHAT

02:05:44.803 --> 02:05:46.305
BEYOND THIS BOTH PROGRAMMATIC

02:05:46.372 --> 02:05:51.710
LEE. AS WELL AS HOW IT WOULD BE

02:05:51.777 --> 02:05:52.645
FUNDED- THERE WAS A DISCUSSION

02:05:52.711 --> 02:05:53.746
ABOUT THE- ACTION. SO ABOUT

TO BE FUNDED IN THE CURRENT

02:05:58.617 --> 02:06:01.053
YEAR- WE HAVE KIND OF A MIXED

02:06:01.120 --> 02:06:03.155
REACTION TO THIS SO. IN GENERAL

02:06:03.222 --> 02:06:04.990

FROM THE MINISTRATION OF

EMPLOYED BY A PROPOSAL HOW

02:06:21.707 --> 02:06:23.309
WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED. IF IT

02:06:23.375 --> 02:06:24.677
GRANT PROGRAMS WHAT CRITERIA

02:06:24.743 --> 02:06:26.445
WOULD BE USED HOW DOLLARS BE

02:06:26.512 --> 02:06:28.047
ALLOCATED ACROSS THE STATE IN

02:06:28.113 --> 02:06:30.015
IN. IN PARTICULAR THIS MANY.

02:06:30.082 --> 02:06:32.051
PROGRAMS THAT THERE'S ALL THERE

02:06:32.117 --> 02:06:34.153
THERE'S A LOT TO WRAP YOUR HEAD

02:06:34.219 --> 02:06:35.788
AROUND AND SO- BUT THE OTHER

02:06:35.854 --> 02:06:36.956
ISSUE TOO IS TO THE EXTENT THAT

02:06:37.022 --> 02:06:39.391
YOU APPROPRIATE THOSE FINES.

02:06:39.458 --> 02:06:41.327
EARLY THAT TAKES THEM OFF THE

02:06:41.393 --> 02:06:43.429
TABLE. AS YOU'RE DELIBERATING

02:06:43.495 --> 02:06:45.264
ON YOUR FULL TWENTY ONE TWENTY

02:06:45.331 --> 02:06:46.732
TWO BUDGET PLAN. AND WE KNOW

02:06:46.799 --> 02:06:48.867
THERE A LOT OF PRESSURES ON. ON

02:06:48.934 --> 02:06:51.570
ON THE ON THE GENERAL FUND IN

02:06:51.637 --> 02:06:52.604
OTHER AREAS OF THE STATE BUDGET

02:06:52.671 --> 02:06:54.440
AS WELL. THAT SAID WE DO THINK

02:06:54.506 --> 02:06:55.274
THERE A COUPLE AREAS WHERE

02:06:55.341 --> 02:06:56.842
EARLY ACTION. COULD REALLY BE

02:06:56.909 --> 02:06:59.044
WARRANTED ONE IS WITH RESPECT

02:06:59.111 --> 02:07:00.379
TO THE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE

02:07:00.446 --> 02:07:01.647
MILLION PROPOSED FROM G. G. R.

02:07:01.714 --> 02:07:03.949
AFTER. IN THE CURRENT YEAR- IN

02:07:04.016 --> 02:07:05.751
AND CERTAINLY THE LEGISLATURE

02:07:05.818 --> 02:07:08.220
UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO APPROVE

02:07:08.287 --> 02:07:10.689
A- CURRENT YEAR. AUGMENTATION

02:07:10.756 --> 02:07:11.490
TO THE CAP AND TRADE

02:07:11.557 --> 02:07:13.559
EXPENDITURE PLAN BUT WE WOULD

02:07:13.625 --> 02:07:14.994
KNOW THAT ONE HUNDRED TWENTY

02:07:15.060 --> 02:07:16.528
FIVE MILLION. ADDED TO THE

02:07:16.595 --> 02:07:17.196
SEVENTY FIVE MILLION ALREADY

02:07:17.262 --> 02:07:18.697
APPROVED IN THE CURRENT YEAR

02:07:18.764 --> 02:07:20.132
BUDGET. WOULD BRING TOTAL

02:07:20.199 --> 02:07:22.167
FUNDING FOR FORESTRY AND FIRE

02:07:22.234 --> 02:07:23.535
PREVENTION ACTIVITIES TO TWO

02:07:23.602 --> 02:07:24.503
HUNDRED MILLION. WHICH IS

02:07:24.570 --> 02:07:26.438
CONSISTENT WITH THE- DIRECTION

02:07:26.505 --> 02:07:28.173
IN SB NINE OH ONE SO WE THINK

02:07:28.240 --> 02:07:29.308
THERE'S- IF THAT OULD BE

02:07:29.375 --> 02:07:31.143
REASONABLE. THE OTHER THING TOO

02:07:31.210 --> 02:07:33.312
THAT MS MORE TALK ABOUT WAS

02:07:33.379 --> 02:07:33.812
THAT- SOME OF THAT EARLY

02:07:33.879 --> 02:07:36.515
ACTION. COULD ALLOW PROJECTS TO

02:07:36.582 --> 02:07:37.649
BE IN PLACE IN ADVANCE OF

02:07:37.716 --> 02:07:38.984
ANOTHER FIRE SEASON WHETHER

02:07:39.051 --> 02:07:40.886
THAT. IN SOME CASES THE TWENTY

02:07:40.953 --> 02:07:41.920
TWENTY ONE FIRE SEASON OR IN

02:07:41.987 --> 02:07:43.789
SOME CASES THE IT REALLY.

02:07:43.856 --> 02:07:44.857
TRYING TO GET PROJECT TEMPLATE

02:07:44.923 --> 02:07:46.425
EVEN BEFORE THE TWENTY TWENTY

02:07:46.492 --> 02:07:51.463
TWO FIRE SEASON. EVERYTHING IN

02:07:51.530 --> 02:07:52.064
EITHER CASE THAT COULD REALLY

02:07:52.131 --> 02:07:52.698
BE WORN DID BUY THAT ACTUALLY.

02:07:52.765 --> 02:07:55.167
OF PUBLIC SAFETY- PROTECT FOR.

02:07:55.234 --> 02:07:55.734
WHERE THEY HAVE CONSIDER WE

02:07:55.801 --> 02:07:57.503
WOULD SIMPLY NOTE THAT- FOR ANY

02:07:57.569 --> 02:07:59.338
OF THOSE CASES- WE'D- SUGGEST

02:07:59.405 --> 02:08:01.507
THAT THE- COMMITTEE HAVE THE

02:08:01.573 --> 02:08:03.042
INVESTIGATION PROVIDE DETAILED

02:08:03.108 --> 02:08:04.543
TIMELINES AND- IMPLEMENTATION

02:08:04.610 --> 02:08:06.812
PLANS DEMONSTRATE THAT THAT

02:08:06.879 --> 02:08:09.815
WOULD. IN FACT BE THE CASE. BUT

02:08:09.882 --> 02:08:12.551
MY NEXT COMMENT IS- IN THINKING

02:08:12.618 --> 02:08:17.556
ABOUT THE- PACKAGE OF PROGRAMS-

02:08:17.623 --> 02:08:18.924
CERTAINLY AS I MENTIONED THIS

02:08:18.991 --> 02:08:20.426
IS A WORTHWHILE PACKAGE TO LOOK

02:08:20.492 --> 02:08:21.326
AT BUT THERE MAY BE OTHER

02:08:21.393 --> 02:08:23.062
OPTIONS THAT YOU WOULD WANT TO

02:08:23.128 --> 02:08:24.363
CONSIDER AND WE DON'T HAVE

02:08:24.430 --> 02:08:26.031
ESTERLY AND ALTERNATIVE-

02:08:26.098 --> 02:08:27.766
PROPOSAL TO PUT IN FRONT OF YOU

02:08:27.833 --> 02:08:28.467
BUT WE DO THINK USING THE

02:08:28.534 --> 02:08:30.502
SPRING PROCESS TO IDENTIFY

02:08:30.569 --> 02:08:32.604
OTHER OPTION BOTH PROGRAMMATIC

02:08:32.671 --> 02:08:35.874
AND FUNDING- IT IS MERITED SO

02:08:35.941 --> 02:08:37.476
FOR EXAMPLE THE- PACKAGE RELIES

02:08:37.543 --> 02:08:38.911
MOSTLY ON EXISTING STATE

02:08:38.977 --> 02:08:40.446
PROGRAMS ARE NOT EXCLUSIVELY

02:08:40.512 --> 02:08:42.247
BUT PRIMARILY EXISTING STATE

02:08:42.314 --> 02:08:43.849
PROGRAMS AND SO MAYBE WORTH

02:08:43.916 --> 02:08:45.451
USING THE SPRING PROCESS TO GET

02:08:45.517 --> 02:08:46.518
INPUT FROM OTHER STAKEHOLDERS

02:08:46.585 --> 02:08:48.253
SUCH AS- LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO

02:08:48.320 --> 02:08:58.931
HAVE. A LOT OF RESPONSIBILITIES

02:08:58.997 --> 02:08:59.565
FOR LAND USE PLANNING FOR LOCAL

02:08:59.631 --> 02:09:01.633
TO SPACE AND FOR LOCAL HAS FUEL

02:09:01.700 --> 02:09:02.734
REDUCTION PER GETTING INPUT

02:09:02.801 --> 02:09:03.702
FROM ALL THE STAKE TO SEE WHAT

02:09:03.769 --> 02:09:04.970
OTHER IDEAS ARE MIGHT BE- THAT

02:09:05.037 --> 02:09:06.805
YOU COULD EITHER- AUGMENT DE

02:09:06.872 --> 02:09:08.540
PLAN OR- FIND IN PLACE OF SOME

02:09:08.607 --> 02:09:11.343
OF THE- I AM IN WE THINK- IT

02:09:11.410 --> 02:09:12.678
INTO THINK ABOUT A LONGER TERM

02:09:12.744 --> 02:09:14.580
ON AS A WITH THE GENERAL BEING

02:09:14.646 --> 02:09:16.748
TIME IN NATURE WE THINK IS IT

02:09:16.815 --> 02:09:17.683
WORTH ENGAGING WITH THE

02:09:17.749 --> 02:09:19.151
ADMINISTRATION ON WHAT ARE

02:09:19.218 --> 02:09:23.489
SOME. LONGER TERM FINDING.

02:09:23.555 --> 02:09:24.556
POSSIBILITY TO FIND OUT SOME

02:09:24.623 --> 02:09:25.491
YOUR PRIOR ACTIVE. ON AN

02:09:25.557 --> 02:09:27.559
ONGOING BASIS AND SO I JUST AS

02:09:27.626 --> 02:09:29.361
EXAMPLES- THE OPERATION HAD

02:09:29.428 --> 02:09:30.696
BEEN BROUGHT UP ALREADY TODAY

02:09:30.762 --> 02:09:33.298
IN A DIFFERENT CONTEXT- THAT IS

02:09:33.365 --> 02:09:35.701
SOMETHING THAT WAS- I'VE DONE A

02:09:35.767 --> 02:09:36.902
COUPLE OF YEARS AGO IN PLACE

02:09:36.969 --> 02:09:39.071
WITH GIGI R. F. THAT IS

02:09:39.138 --> 02:09:39.838
SOMETHING THOUGH IF THEY

02:09:39.905 --> 02:09:41.073
HISTORICALLY WAS USED TO FIND

02:09:41.140 --> 02:09:42.741
PREVENTION AND MITIGATION.

02:09:42.808 --> 02:09:45.944
pOFFICE HAS RECOMMENDED IT IS

02:09:46.011 --> 02:09:48.547
THE- IS HAVING WATER AGENCIES

02:09:48.614 --> 02:09:51.416
BY FINDING WAYS TO GET THEM- TO

02:09:51.483 --> 02:09:52.951
INVEST MORE IN FOREST HEALTH

02:09:53.018 --> 02:09:54.920
PROJECTS IN PRIORITY WATERSHEDS

02:09:54.987 --> 02:09:57.156
SO- SO. THERE'S A COUPLE OF

02:09:57.222 --> 02:09:58.390
EXAMPLES BUT THERE MAY BE A

02:09:58.457 --> 02:10:00.592
BROADER ARRAY OF. ADDITIONAL

02:10:00.659 --> 02:10:04.363
ONGOING STRATEGIES. THE

02:10:04.429 --> 02:10:04.863
LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO

02:10:04.930 --> 02:10:06.765
INVESTIGATE. SO OFTEN WAY- AS I

02:10:06.832 --> 02:10:08.066
SAID YOU COULD CONSIDER THIS

02:10:08.133 --> 02:10:09.601
PACKAGE YOU CAN CONSIDER

02:10:09.668 --> 02:10:11.170
MODIFYING THE PACKAGE IN

02:10:11.236 --> 02:10:13.071
DIFFERENT WAYS- IN IN IN THE IN

02:10:13.138 --> 02:10:14.439
THE PROBABLY KNOW RIGHT MIX OF

02:10:14.506 --> 02:10:15.974
PROGRAMS THAT WE CAN OFFER YOU

02:10:16.041 --> 02:10:17.709
I THINK IDEALLY. WE WOULD BE

02:10:17.776 --> 02:10:19.077
ABLE TO LOOK AT THE RESEARCH

02:10:19.144 --> 02:10:21.079
LITERATURE AND TELL YOU WELL

02:10:21.146 --> 02:10:22.714
HERE THE DIFFERENT MIX OF

02:10:22.781 --> 02:10:24.950
PROGRAMS AND HERE'S THE- COST

02:10:25.017 --> 02:10:27.352
EFFECTIVENESS OF EACH ONE- AND

02:10:27.419 --> 02:10:28.687
WHILE WE'RE THERE CERTAINLY IS

02:10:28.754 --> 02:10:30.055
RESEARCH DEMONSTRATING THAT

02:10:30.122 --> 02:10:31.290
MANY OF THE STRATEGIES ARE

02:10:31.356 --> 02:10:32.491
EFFECTIVE AT REDUCING WILDFIRE

02:10:32.558 --> 02:10:35.561
RISK- WHETHER THAT- FOR

02:10:35.627 --> 02:10:36.728
SPENDING ACTIVITY DEFENSIBLE

02:10:36.795 --> 02:10:39.097
SPACE HOME HARDENING- FUEL

02:10:39.164 --> 02:10:40.465
BREAKS ALL THOSE. I THINK THERE

02:10:40.532 --> 02:10:41.533
IS RESEARCH DEMONSTRATING THAT

02:10:41.600 --> 02:10:42.401
CAN BE EFFECTIVE WHEN

02:10:42.467 --> 02:10:44.903
IMPLEMENTED WELL AND- THE RIGHT

02:10:44.970 --> 02:10:47.005
PLACES- IT WE DON'T REALLY HAVE

02:10:47.072 --> 02:10:48.006
THAT LEVEL OF DETAIL TO TELL

02:10:48.073 --> 02:10:49.575
YOU WHAT WHICH ONE OF THOSE BY

02:10:49.641 --> 02:10:50.442
EACH YEAR A DOLLAR SPENT ON

02:10:50.509 --> 02:10:52.778
ONE. BUYS YOU MORE PUBLIC

02:10:52.844 --> 02:10:54.146
SAFETY OR OTHER BENEFITS THAT

02:10:54.213 --> 02:10:55.447
YOU MIGHT CARE ABOUT RELIGION

02:10:55.514 --> 02:10:57.416
TO OTHERS. I'M KIND OF

02:10:57.482 --> 02:10:58.750
COMPLICATING THIS TOO IS THAT

02:10:58.817 --> 02:10:59.785
THERE ARE A FEW SEVERAL THESE

02:10:59.851 --> 02:11:01.553
PROGRAMS WERE I THINK WE'RE

02:11:01.620 --> 02:11:02.154
STILL LOOKING FOR ADDITIONAL

02:11:02.221 --> 02:11:03.622
INFORMATION. WE THINK YOU

02:11:03.689 --> 02:11:04.856
SHOULD LOOK FOR ADDITIONAL

02:11:04.923 --> 02:11:05.324
INFORMATION FROM THE

02:11:05.390 --> 02:11:08.160
MINISTRATION ON. THE JACKET

02:11:08.227 --> 02:11:10.329
IMPLEMENTATION PLANS AND ARE

02:11:10.395 --> 02:11:11.396
PROJECTED OUTCOMES FROM THE

02:11:11.463 --> 02:11:12.965
PROGRAMS AND WE HAVE THAT FOR

02:11:13.031 --> 02:11:14.032
SOME OF THE FOR OVER SOME OF

02:11:14.099 --> 02:11:15.567
THE PROGRAM BUT NOT OTHERS. AND

02:11:15.634 --> 02:11:19.471
SO. IN COMBINATION I IS THE- WE

02:11:19.538 --> 02:11:23.976
THINK YOU'RE GOING TO- HAVE TO-

02:11:24.042 --> 02:11:25.744
THEY HAVE TO FIND OTHER WAYS TO

02:11:25.811 --> 02:11:26.778
BALANCE WHAT YOU THINK IS THE

02:11:26.845 --> 02:11:28.213
RIGHT MIX OF PROGRAM BASED ON

02:11:28.280 --> 02:11:29.915
YOUR PRIORITIES AND SO THAT MAY

02:11:29.982 --> 02:11:31.149
FOR EXAMPLE LOOKING AT OTHER

02:11:31.216 --> 02:11:33.418
FACTORS LIKE HOW DO YOU BALANCE

02:11:33.485 --> 02:11:34.319
THE DIFFERENT BENEFITS

02:11:34.386 --> 02:11:36.388
ASSOCIATED WITH ONE SET OF

02:11:36.455 --> 02:11:38.223
PROGRAM FIRST AND ANOTHER SO

02:11:38.290 --> 02:11:39.524
FOR EXAMPLE IF THE

02:11:39.591 --> 02:11:41.793
ADMINISTRATION'S PLAN BUT THE-

02:11:41.860 --> 02:11:42.594
SOMEWHAT MORE THAN HALF THE

02:11:42.661 --> 02:11:45.430
MONEY. PROPOSED TOWARDS- FORCED

02:11:45.497 --> 02:11:47.099
HEALTH ACTIVITIES AND

02:11:47.165 --> 02:11:48.500
LANDSCAPE- THERE'S NOTHING

02:11:48.567 --> 02:11:50.469
WRONG WITH THAT PER SE BUT- BY

02:11:50.535 --> 02:11:51.837
COMPARISON BUT THE MUCH SMALLER

02:11:51.903 --> 02:11:53.505
EMPHASIS ON COMMUNITY HARD

02:11:53.572 --> 02:11:54.339
MINUTES SO YOU'LL WANT TO THINK

02:11:54.406 --> 02:11:55.841
ABOUT EACH OF THOSE DIFFERENT

02:11:55.907 --> 02:11:57.376
SETS OF ACTIVITIES COMES WITH A

02:11:57.442 --> 02:11:58.844
DIFFERENT SET OF BENEFITS AND

02:11:58.910 --> 02:12:02.347
SO YOU'LL WANT. TO THINK ABOUT

02:12:02.414 --> 02:12:03.081
WHAT YOUR- PRIORITIES ARE.

02:12:03.148 --> 02:12:05.250
ASHLEY WHATEVER PILOT PACKAGE

02:12:05.317 --> 02:12:06.885
YOU DO ADOPTED ANY. WE

02:12:06.952 --> 02:12:08.353
SUGGESTED THE IMPORTANT TO

02:12:08.420 --> 02:12:09.655
INCLUDE REPORTING MEASURES AND

02:12:09.721 --> 02:12:11.423
THIS IS PARTLY TO. HOLD THE

02:12:11.490 --> 02:12:12.758
ADMINISTRATION ACCOUNTABLE FOR

02:12:12.824 --> 02:12:13.992
DELIVERING- WHATEVER OUTCOMES

02:12:14.059 --> 02:12:15.661
IT IS SAYS IT'LL BE ABLE TO

02:12:15.727 --> 02:12:17.195
DELIVER IT WITH THE FUNDING AND

02:12:17.262 --> 02:12:18.597
JUST GIVEN THE- MAGNITUDE OF

02:12:18.664 --> 02:12:19.631
FUNDING REQUESTED WE THINK

02:12:19.698 --> 02:12:20.766
THAT'S IMPORTANT. BUT EVEN

02:12:20.832 --> 02:12:22.100
PROBABLY MORE IMPORTANT AND

02:12:22.167 --> 02:12:23.568
THAT IS IF WE HAVE GOOD

02:12:23.635 --> 02:12:25.404
REPORTING METRICS IN PLACE THAT

02:12:25.470 --> 02:12:26.905
CAN HELP INFORM FUTURE DECISION

02:12:26.972 --> 02:12:29.675
MAKING. BOTH HOW TO- HOW TO

02:12:29.741 --> 02:12:33.145
PRIORITIZE FUTURE- PROGRAMS HOW

02:12:33.211 --> 02:12:34.046
TO HOW TO TARGET DIFFERENT

02:12:34.112 --> 02:12:35.247
PROGRAMS THAT WE CAN LEARN.

02:12:35.314 --> 02:12:37.049
EVEN MORE ABOUT WHERE WE CAN BE

02:12:37.115 --> 02:12:37.916
WHERE PROJECTS ARE MOST

02:12:37.983 --> 02:12:40.886
EFFECTIVE- IN ALSO HELP. INFORM

02:12:40.952 --> 02:12:42.554
FUTURE- BUDGET DECISIONS YOU

02:12:42.621 --> 02:12:44.489
MIGHT. YOU MIGHT HAVE. SO THAT

WHAT. GREENHOUSE GAS MONEY

02:15:45.770 --> 02:15:47.272
SOMEONE THE THINGS WE'VE THE

02:15:47.339 --> 02:15:49.074
BELLY OF THIS POINT OUT IS THAT

02:15:49.140 --> 02:15:49.808
YOU KNOW SOME OF THESE

02:15:49.875 --> 02:15:51.710
GREENHOUSE GAS MONEY. ARE

02:15:51.776 --> 02:15:54.613
CONTINUING. FIVE A SOURCES OF

02:15:54.679 --> 02:15:56.147
FUNDS THAT WE CAN DO THAT

02:15:56.214 --> 02:15:57.616
CONTINUE TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM

02:15:57.682 --> 02:15:59.784
AND IN REDUCING THE CARBON IN

02:15:59.851 --> 02:16:01.253
OUR ENVIRONMENT WE'VE DONE A

02:16:01.319 --> 02:16:02.687
LOT OF WORK ON THESE DIFFERENT

02:16:02.754 --> 02:16:04.623
PROGRAMS EACH YEAR WE SEE WE

02:16:04.689 --> 02:16:06.691
SCRUB THEM. SO SOME OF THOSE.

02:16:06.758 --> 02:16:08.827

WE'VE GOT DATA ON IT THAT WE

02:16:13.698 --> 02:16:16.301
THINK THIS IS A GOOD PROGRAM.

02:16:16.368 --> 02:16:18.870
PROBLEM OF TAKING THIS BILLION

02:16:18.937 --> 02:16:20.672
DOLLARS ANDUSING ALL GENERAL

02:16:20.739 --> 02:16:22.974

HAVE TO CONTINUE TO DO THE WORK

02:16:27.546 --> 02:16:28.780
SO YOU HAVE THIS IN FUSION OF

02:16:28.847 --> 02:16:30.382
MONEY THAT GOES IN THERE TO

02:16:30.448 --> 02:16:33.518
ADDRESS. THE FOREST LANDSCAPES

02:16:33.585 --> 02:16:35.253
BUT THEN IN THE OUT YEARS WITH

02:16:35.320 --> 02:16:36.621
THE FUNDS THAT WE HEAR FROM CAP

02:16:36.688 --> 02:16:38.223

02:16:38.290 --> 02:16:39.925
NOT ONE AND DONE WE CONTINUE TO

02:16:39.991 --> 02:16:42.260
FUND THAT WHAT'S WRONG WITH

02:16:42.327 --> 02:16:45.530
THAT PHILOSOPHY. WE DEFER TO MY

02:16:45.597 --> 02:16:46.731
COLLEAGUE HAD SAID BERMAN

THAT IT. THIS ORDER AT EIGHT SO

02:16:55.674 --> 02:16:58.877
I THINK. OF OUR PROPOSAL DOES

02:16:58.944 --> 02:17:00.579
STRIKE TRENDS SO I JUST WANNA

02:17:00.645 --> 02:17:01.746
MAKE SURE THAT THAT CAN

02:17:01.813 --> 02:17:03.982

IN A ONE TIME BASIS THEY'VE

02:17:08.119 --> 02:17:09.688
BEEN PROVIDED NO WAY THAT IT

02:17:09.754 --> 02:17:11.756
MAKES THE FUNDING AVAILABLE FOR

02:17:11.823 --> 02:17:12.624
FORTY FIVE YEARS WHICH IS KIND

02:17:12.691 --> 02:17:14.659
OF A TYPICAL BUDGET WINDOW THAT

02:17:14.726 --> 02:17:16.094
WE INVEST IN AND ALLOWS FOR

02:17:16.161 --> 02:17:18.597
THESE PROJECTS TO KIND OF- TO

FUND INTO OUR OUR PERSPECTIVE

02:17:39.618 --> 02:17:42.487
ON IT WAS IF WE- INVEST THIS IN

02:17:42.554 --> 02:17:43.088
ONE HUNDRED OFTEN WE HAVE NOW

BUT PROVIDED IN THE WAY THAT IT

02:17:44.923 --> 02:17:46.925
HAS AN AMOUNT AND AVAILABILITY.

02:17:46.992 --> 02:17:48.627
THAT LETS THESE PROJECTS YOU

02:17:48.693 --> 02:17:49.995
TAKE PLACE OVER FOUR FIVE YEARS

02:17:50.061 --> 02:17:52.230
AGO IT STILL GIVES US. THE SAME

02:17:52.297 --> 02:17:53.331
KIND OF BENEFITS IS IF WE DID

02:17:53.398 --> 02:17:55.600
SMALLER INVESTMENTS- EACH YEAR

02:17:55.667 --> 02:17:56.434

ONGOING COMPONENT AS WELL. AND

02:18:12.384 --> 02:18:13.718

WE REALLY SOLVE THESE PROBLEMS

02:19:56.521 --> 02:19:58.490
BECAUSE THERE'S- PIECES OF IT

02:19:58.556 --> 02:20:00.525
IN. IN JESSICA OR MISS

02:20:00.592 --> 02:20:02.827

I REALLY LIKE BUT YOUR- FIRST

02:20:06.264 --> 02:20:09.267
OF ALL NUMBER ONE. WE HAVE THE

02:20:09.334 --> 02:20:10.969
REASON YOU DON'T SEE PRIVATE

02:20:11.035 --> 02:20:11.669
INVESTMENT WHICH IS WHAT WE

02:20:11.736 --> 02:20:13.505
DESPERATELY NEED. SO WE HAVE

02:20:13.571 --> 02:20:14.873
INFRASTRUCTURE AVAILABLE TO

02:20:14.939 --> 02:20:15.807
TAKE ALL THESE PRODUCTS TO

02:20:15.874 --> 02:20:17.242
THERE'S VALUE IN SOME OF THE

02:20:17.308 --> 02:20:18.276
INS IN MOST OF THE STUFF THERE

02:20:18.343 --> 02:20:21.146
IS SOME VALUE. BUT IT DEPENDS

02:20:21.212 --> 02:20:24.015
ON. HOW FAR YOU ARE FROM. THE

02:20:24.082 --> 02:20:25.984
INFRASTRUCTURE. TO MAKE IT

02:20:26.050 --> 02:20:27.752
WORK. SO WE NEED TO PLACE

02:20:27.819 --> 02:20:29.687
INFRASTRUCTURE. IN THE AREAS

02:20:29.754 --> 02:20:30.822
WHERE WE KNOW WE HAVE A LONG

02:20:30.889 --> 02:20:32.423
TERM COMMITMENT. PRIVATE MONEY

02:20:32.490 --> 02:20:33.658
WILL COME IN AND PRIVATE

02:20:33.725 --> 02:20:35.093
BUSINESS PEOPLE WILL COME IN.

02:20:35.160 --> 02:20:37.428
AND BUILD FACILITIES. WITH NEW

02:20:37.495 --> 02:20:39.798
TECHNOLOGIES TO SUPPLY US WITH

02:20:39.864 --> 02:20:42.734
CROSS LAMINATED. WOOD PELLETS

02:20:42.801 --> 02:20:43.701
ALL THESE OTHER THINGS THAT ARE

02:20:43.768 --> 02:20:45.470
OUT THERE BUT THEY CANNOT DO

02:20:45.537 --> 02:20:46.871
THAT BECAUSE THEIR BUSINESS

02:20:46.938 --> 02:20:49.174
PEOPLE AND THEY HAVE TO HAVE A

02:20:49.240 --> 02:20:50.975
RETURN ON THEIR INVESTMENT. THE

02:20:51.042 --> 02:20:52.310
REASON YOU DON'T GET RETURNS

02:20:52.377 --> 02:20:52.911
BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE A LONG

02:20:52.977 --> 02:20:55.246
TERM SUPPLY. YOU HAVE SHORT

02:20:55.313 --> 02:20:56.648
TERM SUPPLY YOU HAVE WE'RE

02:20:56.714 --> 02:20:57.715

GOING TO DO THIS WE WE'RE GONNA

02:20:59.784 --> 02:21:02.153
CHECK THIS STUFF OUT. AND WE

02:21:02.220 --> 02:21:03.588
VOTE ON THE GROUND NOW BECAUSE

02:21:03.655 --> 02:21:04.889
YOU CAN'T HOLD THREE HUNDRED

02:21:04.956 --> 02:21:06.090
MILES TO FACILITY DOESN'T WORK

02:21:06.157 --> 02:21:07.525
DOESN'T PAY COSTA. THE COST IS

02:21:07.592 --> 02:21:10.261
A- WE NEED TO BE A PARTNER WITH

02:21:10.328 --> 02:21:11.563
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT I KEEP

02:21:11.629 --> 02:21:13.364
GOING BACK TO THIS INTEL WE-

02:21:13.431 --> 02:21:15.667
GET STEWARDSHIP CONTRACTS. REAL

02:21:15.733 --> 02:21:18.102
ONES THAT ALLOW US TO DO TWENTY

02:21:18.169 --> 02:21:19.070
YEARS SO SOMEBODY WILL COME AND

02:21:19.137 --> 02:21:20.705
INVEST A HUNDRED MILLION

02:21:20.772 --> 02:21:23.441
DOLLARS IN A PLAN. SO THEY CAN

02:21:23.508 --> 02:21:25.610
READ SO THEY CAN PAY OFF THE

02:21:25.677 --> 02:21:26.811
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS BECAUSE

02:21:26.878 --> 02:21:29.480
OF A LONG TERM SUPPLY. I FOR

02:21:29.547 --> 02:21:32.650
THE LIFE OF ME I SIT ON EQ. I

02:21:32.717 --> 02:21:35.854
SAID I SAID ON- WHAT PART OF MY

02:21:35.920 --> 02:21:37.055
LIFE IN THIS IN THE AND I HEAR

02:21:37.121 --> 02:21:38.189
I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MANY BILLS

WE'VE GROWN MORE HABITAT. IN

02:21:55.874 --> 02:21:58.443
THIS STATE. THAT IS DESTROYING

02:21:58.509 --> 02:21:59.677
THE WATER SAYS THAT ALL THE

02:21:59.744 --> 02:22:01.246
PEOPLE IN THE URBAN AREAS NEED

02:22:01.312 --> 02:22:02.614
TO DRINK AND WE NEED FOR FARMS

02:22:02.680 --> 02:22:05.183

COLLEAGUE WAS REQUIRED THAT WE

02:22:25.436 --> 02:22:27.105
NEED TO ATTACK THE FIRE BUT WE

02:22:27.171 --> 02:22:27.839
ALSO NEED TO LOOK AT THE

02:22:27.906 --> 02:22:31.376
VEGETATION. OF BTP VEGETATION

02:22:31.442 --> 02:22:35.013
ARMOR STANDS FOR- VEGETATION

02:26:00.685 --> 02:26:02.787
THEIR BOARDS. IN APPROVAL THOSE

02:26:02.854 --> 02:26:04.489
PERMITS BOTH WITH THEIR LOCAL

02:26:04.555 --> 02:26:07.125
STAFF AS WELL AS THE BOARD'S-

02:26:07.191 --> 02:26:09.694
IN SO I HAVE SOME VERY SPECIFIC

02:26:09.760 --> 02:26:12.463
QUESTIONS- THREE QUICK ONES.

02:26:12.530 --> 02:26:14.432
HOW MANY DAYS THIS WINTER HAS A

02:26:14.499 --> 02:26:15.533
CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD

02:26:15.600 --> 02:26:17.802
CERTIFIED THAT IT'S BAD AT THE

02:26:17.869 --> 02:26:19.670
IT IS SAFE TO BURN ACROSS THIS

02:26:19.737 --> 02:26:22.240
YEAR AS- AND- AND- COASTAL

02:26:22.306 --> 02:26:25.109
RANGE. DO YOU HAVE THAT OF TOP

02:26:25.176 --> 02:26:27.578
YOUR HEAD SO I PROBABLY GONNA

02:26:27.645 --> 02:26:29.647
TAKE A ESTIMATE ON THIS PLEASE

02:26:29.714 --> 02:26:32.250
BUT I'M GENERALLY FROM ABOUT

02:26:32.316 --> 02:26:36.354
NOVEMBER TO JULY. ABOUT 97% OF

02:26:36.420 --> 02:26:39.056
THE DAYS OUR BIRTHDAYS. SO THE

02:26:39.123 --> 02:26:40.224
VAST MAJORITY OF DAYS ARE

02:26:40.291 --> 02:26:42.160
CONSIDERED FOR DAYS AND THEN IT

02:26:42.226 --> 02:26:44.762
JUST I THINK- SENATOR YOU KNOW

02:26:44.829 --> 02:26:46.030
THIS BUT JUST YOU KNOW FOR KIND

02:26:46.097 --> 02:26:49.233
OF THAT EDUCATION OF OTHERS.

02:26:49.300 --> 02:26:51.569
HAVE A TWO PHASE PROCESS- CARD

02:26:51.636 --> 02:26:53.571
DOES BURN CALLS IF THEY WE HAVE

02:26:53.638 --> 02:26:55.339
A TEAM OF METEOROLOGISTS THAT

02:26:55.406 --> 02:26:57.041
ARE AT. THEY'RE ACTUALLY

02:26:57.108 --> 02:26:59.177
WORKING THEY WORK TWENTY FOUR

02:26:59.243 --> 02:26:59.744
SEVEN AND THEY MAKE A BIRD

02:26:59.810 --> 02:27:01.879
CALLS EVERY DAY AND THEN AS YOU

02:27:01.946 --> 02:27:03.514
NOTED THE LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS

02:27:03.581 --> 02:27:06.284
SO LOCAL AND AGENCIES THAT HAVE

02:27:06.350 --> 02:27:08.119
SORT OF MORE. ON THE GROUND

02:27:08.186 --> 02:27:10.087
INFORMATION THEY'RE CLOSER TO

02:27:10.154 --> 02:27:11.088
WHAT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING IN

02:27:11.155 --> 02:27:13.057
THEIR LOCAL AREAS ARE THE ONES

02:27:13.124 --> 02:27:16.627
THAT ACTUALLY. AUTHORIZED THE

02:27:16.694 --> 02:27:17.261
BIRDS. YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT

02:27:17.328 --> 02:27:19.197
NOT. THAT THANK YOU SO MUCH-

02:27:19.263 --> 02:27:21.032
THE OTHER QUESTION I HAVE IS.

02:27:21.098 --> 02:27:23.601
DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY ACRES HAVE

02:27:23.668 --> 02:27:25.536
BEEN TREATED WITH PRESCRIBED

02:27:25.603 --> 02:27:28.539
BURNS IN THE LAST YEAR IN OVER

02:27:28.606 --> 02:27:31.242
THE LAST TWENTY FOUR MONTHS. SO

02:27:31.309 --> 02:27:33.644
AND THERE'S THIS IS DATA SAID

02:27:33.711 --> 02:27:35.179
THAT AND SOME OF IT IS REPORTED

02:27:35.246 --> 02:27:37.415
INTO A SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE

02:27:37.481 --> 02:27:38.449
WHICH IS CALLED PEEPERS WHICH

02:27:38.516 --> 02:27:39.917
I'M NOT EVEN GONNA TRY TO

02:27:39.984 --> 02:27:40.751
REMEMBER WHAT THE ACRONYM

02:27:40.818 --> 02:27:43.521
STANDS FOR. SO AND LET ME SEE

02:27:43.588 --> 02:27:45.856
IF I ACTUALLY. I OF COURSE

02:27:45.923 --> 02:27:47.325
DON'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION AT

02:27:47.391 --> 02:27:49.994
THE TOUCH THE TIP OF MY- AND- I

02:27:50.061 --> 02:27:55.566
THINK THEY MAY HAVE IT. BUT.

02:27:55.633 --> 02:27:57.768
THAT WE HAVE THAT DISTRICTS CAN

02:27:57.835 --> 02:28:00.471
USE AND LAND MANAGERS CAN USE

02:28:00.538 --> 02:28:01.772
TO KIND OF START THE BURN

02:28:01.839 --> 02:28:03.474
APPLICATION PROCESS THAT WAS

02:28:03.541 --> 02:28:05.076
KIND OF A WAY TO STANDARDIZE

02:28:05.142 --> 02:28:07.478
THAT PROCESS- THE FUNDING THAT

02:28:07.545 --> 02:28:09.914
IS IN THIS- BUDGET REQUEST

02:28:09.981 --> 02:28:11.749
ACTUALLY WILL HELP US CONTINUE

02:28:11.816 --> 02:28:13.551
A PROGRAM WHERE WE DO TRAINING

02:28:13.618 --> 02:28:15.686
AND OUTREACH. TO LAND MANAGERS

02:28:15.753 --> 02:28:18.856
AIR DISTRICTS- TO TRAIN THEM ON

02:28:18.923 --> 02:28:20.191
KIND OF YOU KNOW WORKING

02:28:20.258 --> 02:28:22.126
TOGETHER AND FOR USING PEEPERS

02:28:22.193 --> 02:28:23.995
AS A WAY TO KIND OF. AND

02:28:24.061 --> 02:28:25.796
STANDARDIZE THAT PROCESS GOING

02:28:25.863 --> 02:28:28.766
FORWARD I'M NOT ALL PRESCRIBED

02:28:28.833 --> 02:28:30.501
BURNS ARE REPORTED INTO THE

02:28:30.568 --> 02:28:32.103
PEEPERS DISCUSSION AND WE'VE

02:28:32.169 --> 02:28:33.838
ACTUALLY BEEN WORKING AT.

02:28:33.904 --> 02:28:35.940
WHAT'S REPORTED INTO OUR SYSTEM

02:28:36.007 --> 02:28:39.210
WHAT'S REPORTED IN. AND THE

NUMBER RIGHT OFF THE TOP OF MY

02:28:49.086 --> 02:28:50.855

CONVINCED THAT ACREAGE ALONE

02:33:31.535 --> 02:33:32.369
DEFINES RESILIENCE IF WE

02:33:32.436 --> 02:33:36.407
SUDDENLY TREAT A MILLION ACRES-

02:33:36.473 --> 02:33:38.475
IT IS THE STATE'S SAFER DEPENDS

02:33:38.542 --> 02:33:42.580
DEPENDS WHICH ONES- SO JUST. IT

02:33:42.646 --> 02:33:44.181
IT IT SAID IT MAY BE A LONGER

02:33:44.248 --> 02:33:45.416
TERM QUESTION OF THE L. A. O.

02:33:45.482 --> 02:33:47.051
IS ALSO THOUGHT ABOUT THIS BUT-

02:33:47.117 --> 02:33:48.719
TRYING TO GET SOMEWAY TO

02:33:48.786 --> 02:33:51.355
QUANTIFY. OUR RESILIENCE

02:33:51.422 --> 02:33:53.657
STRATEGY AND THEN TO BE ABLE TO

02:33:53.724 --> 02:33:55.426
EVALUATE OURSELVES ALONG THOSE

02:33:55.492 --> 02:33:56.827
METRICS TO SEE HOW WE'RE DOING.

02:33:56.894 --> 02:33:59.630
YEAR ON YEAR- FOR INSTANCE THE

02:33:59.697 --> 02:34:01.131
DEFENSIBLE SPACE INSPECTION

02:34:01.198 --> 02:34:03.434
BUDGET HERE AS YOU AS THE

02:34:03.500 --> 02:34:04.501
DEPUTY FIRE MARSHAL JUST

02:34:04.568 --> 02:34:06.503
POINTED OUT DOESN'T COVER ANY

02:34:06.570 --> 02:34:08.138
EXISTING HOMES EXCEPT FOR

02:34:08.205 --> 02:34:09.974
PEOPLE ARE SELLING. THAT'S THE

02:34:10.040 --> 02:34:11.141
ENTIRE BUDGET FOR DEFENSIBLE

02:34:11.208 --> 02:34:12.042
SPACE THAT'S BEEN PUT FORWARD

02:34:12.109 --> 02:34:14.078
HERE IS FOR TWENTY FIVE

02:34:14.144 --> 02:34:15.679
THOUSAND HOMES A YEAR. YOU SAID

02:34:15.746 --> 02:34:16.680
THERE'S TWO MILLION PEOPLE

02:34:16.747 --> 02:34:18.382
LIVING IN VERY HIGH FIRE

02:34:18.449 --> 02:34:23.020
SEVERITY SEN SO WE'RE ABOUT.

02:34:23.087 --> 02:34:24.655
99% SHORT- WE'VE COVERED ABOUT

02:34:24.722 --> 02:34:28.592
1% THIS FOR. SO THAT DOESN'T

02:34:28.659 --> 02:34:29.927
FEEL LIKE THAT IF YOU'D LIKE

02:34:29.994 --> 02:34:32.496
YOU KNOW OKAY SO WORK. HOW MANY

02:34:32.563 --> 02:34:35.065
BILLION SHORT JUST ON THAT

02:34:35.132 --> 02:34:36.500
FIRST CONCENTRIC CIRCLE YOU

02:34:36.567 --> 02:34:38.469
MENTION OF PARDONING ALONE I

02:34:38.535 --> 02:34:40.437
JUST I NEED IS I NEED WE NEED

02:34:40.504 --> 02:34:41.572
SOME METRICS TO BE THE RIGHT

02:34:41.639 --> 02:34:43.073
SIZE OUR STRATEGY HERE I'M

02:34:43.140 --> 02:34:46.577
JUST. TRYING TO GET THAT SET SO

02:34:46.644 --> 02:34:48.912
WE CAN EVALUATE OURSELVES.

02:34:48.979 --> 02:34:49.613
ABSOLUTELY I THINK IT'S A

02:34:49.680 --> 02:34:51.348
CRITICAL- FOUNDATION AND I CAN

02:34:51.415 --> 02:34:52.650
GIVE YOU A LITTLE SENSE OF HOW

02:34:52.716 --> 02:34:55.219
OUR LAND USE HOW ARE PLANNING

02:34:55.285 --> 02:34:57.688
IS- ADAPTING AND MODERNIZING-

02:34:57.755 --> 02:34:59.757
AS OUR TECHNOLOGY AND DATA

02:34:59.823 --> 02:35:01.825
ANALYTICS ARE MODERNIZING TO BE

02:35:01.892 --> 02:35:03.093
ABLE TO COME UP WITH THESE.

02:35:03.160 --> 02:35:04.428
MORE WHAT A RESILIENT

02:35:04.495 --> 02:35:05.996
LANDSCAPES- AND RESILIENT

02:35:06.063 --> 02:35:07.598
COMMUNITIES LOOK LIKE BECAUSE

02:35:07.665 --> 02:35:09.199
IT IS GOING TO BE A FACTOR OF

02:35:09.266 --> 02:35:10.701
ALL THREE OF THOSE COMBINATIONS

02:35:10.768 --> 02:35:12.436
THAT ONCE THOSE HEALTHIER

02:35:12.503 --> 02:35:14.171
LANDSCAPES. YOUR BRAKES TO REST

02:35:14.238 --> 02:35:17.007
A FIRE ESCAPE AND- AND SURVIVOR

02:35:17.074 --> 02:35:17.775
HARDENED INFRASTRUCTURE IN

02:35:17.841 --> 02:35:20.844
COMMUNITIES. AND SO- YOU KNOW

02:35:20.911 --> 02:35:22.846
WE HAVE TARGETS THAT MEASURE

02:35:22.913 --> 02:35:24.348
OUR WORKFORCE HONEST I HAVE

02:35:24.415 --> 02:35:25.849
BEEN LAID OUT SO FOR EXAMPLE

02:35:25.916 --> 02:35:27.418
THAT TARGET A FIVE HUNDRED

02:35:27.484 --> 02:35:28.819
THOUSAND ACRES A YEAR TREATED

02:35:28.886 --> 02:35:30.421
IS BASED ON. THE FORCE CARBON

02:35:30.487 --> 02:35:32.322
PLANT WHICH IDENTIFIED ABOUT

02:35:32.389 --> 02:35:33.624
FIFTEEN MILLION ACRES NOW THAT

02:35:33.691 --> 02:35:34.892
ARE IN NEED OF TREATMENT

02:35:34.958 --> 02:35:37.194
THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND WE'VE

02:35:37.261 --> 02:35:38.262
GOTTEN OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS TO

02:35:38.328 --> 02:35:39.797
COMMIT. TO REACHING THAT LEVEL

02:35:39.863 --> 02:35:41.131
BUT A SENATOR DOLLY POINTED

02:35:41.198 --> 02:35:42.666
OUT- THEY'RE NOT THERE YET-

02:35:42.733 --> 02:35:44.301
THEY'VE BEEN INVESTING ABOUT

02:35:44.368 --> 02:35:45.135
FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR

02:35:45.202 --> 02:35:47.304
AND HAZARDOUS FUEL REDUCTION.

02:35:47.371 --> 02:35:48.572
AND- WHEREAS THIS BUDGET

02:35:48.639 --> 02:35:51.742
PROPOSAL HAS ABOUT- SIX HUNDRED

02:35:51.809 --> 02:35:52.676
FORTY FOUR MILLION THAT CAN BE

02:35:52.743 --> 02:35:55.045
ACROSS YOU KNOW IN THOSE-

02:35:55.112 --> 02:35:56.747
THOSE. SECTORS FOR HAZARDOUS

02:35:56.814 --> 02:35:59.850
YOU'LL BY COMPARISON AND SO- IT

02:35:59.917 --> 02:36:02.052
JUST IT'S REALLY CRUCIAL THAT

02:36:02.119 --> 02:36:04.722
WE ARE HITTING OUR TARGETS THAT

02:36:04.788 --> 02:36:05.956
EARLY OUT IN THE FOREST CARBON

02:36:06.023 --> 02:36:07.791
PLANNED- AS I MENTIONED TWO

02:36:07.858 --> 02:36:09.159
MILLION HOMES IN NEED A

02:36:09.226 --> 02:36:10.828
RETROFIT THAT NUMBER COMES FROM

02:36:10.894 --> 02:36:12.096
HE CALIFORNIA FIRE STATE

02:36:12.162 --> 02:36:13.163
COUNCILS. BUT WHEN YOU'RE

02:36:13.230 --> 02:36:14.465
LOOKING AT FIFTEEN THOUSAND

02:36:14.531 --> 02:36:15.733
DOLLARS TO FIFTY THOUSAND

02:36:15.799 --> 02:36:16.734
DOLLARS A HOME YOU'RE LOOKING

02:36:16.800 --> 02:36:18.335
AT UPWARDS OF TWO HUNDRED

02:36:18.402 --> 02:36:19.336
BILLION DOLLARS TO BE ABLE TO

02:36:19.403 --> 02:36:20.971
DO YOU. RETROFIT SO THAT'S WHY

02:36:21.038 --> 02:36:22.339
YOU NEED TOOLS LIKE EDUCATION

02:36:22.406 --> 02:36:23.774
AND OUTREACH TO BE ABLE TO HELP

02:36:23.841 --> 02:36:26.310
HOMEOWNERS THAT CAN AFFORD IT

02:36:26.376 --> 02:36:27.678
TO MAKE THOSE DIFFERENCES AND

02:36:27.745 --> 02:36:29.613
THEN MY VOICE COMMUNITIES. HERE

YOU KNOW LIKE ANY OF THE

02:36:37.721 --> 02:36:39.056
CLIMATE CRISIS WE'RE FACING

02:36:39.123 --> 02:36:41.058
WHETHER ITS DROUGHT- OR EXTREME

02:36:41.125 --> 02:36:42.259
HEAT. THERE'S A LOT OF

02:36:42.326 --> 02:36:44.495
EDUCATION THAT CAN ALSO REALLY

THINGS WE DO YOU DO. ADDED THAT

02:37:00.244 --> 02:37:02.746
YOU HEALTH- THERE THAT CAN FIRE

02:37:02.813 --> 02:37:05.449
HOW OF THE FRAT PROGRAM. WHICH

02:37:05.516 --> 02:37:07.851
IS THEIR ANALYSTS UNIT THE-

02:37:07.918 --> 02:37:12.089
LOOK. I AT AT WHERE WE HAVE.

02:37:12.156 --> 02:37:13.924
LANDSCAPE AND PRIOR COME. I

02:37:13.991 --> 02:37:15.859
DON'T WHERE THE HIGH VIRUS

02:37:15.926 --> 02:37:18.495
ZONES ARE RIGHT NOW DEVELOP. A

02:37:18.562 --> 02:37:21.131

REALLY RAN. WHO RICH. ME ACROSS

02:37:23.901 --> 02:37:25.235
THE ENTIRE WATER. SO THAT LOOKS

02:37:25.302 --> 02:37:27.838
NOT JUST AT- FIRE RISK CAN

02:37:27.905 --> 02:37:31.208
SAFETY IT ALSO INTO- OTHER DAYS

02:37:31.275 --> 02:37:33.110
ANALYTICS AROUND CARDS. IN

02:37:33.177 --> 02:37:36.079
WATER HEALTH. AND- AND PART OF

02:37:36.146 --> 02:37:38.048
OUR JOB PLANNING YOUR SUPPORT

IN. HABITAT WORK- THEN IT HELPS

02:37:57.134 --> 02:37:59.169
DESIGN. THESE PROJECTS BETTER

02:37:59.236 --> 02:38:00.971
BE ABLE TO REACH HIM EVERY.

02:38:01.038 --> 02:38:03.807
IMPACT BECAUSE WE'RE TO AVOID

02:38:03.874 --> 02:38:07.044
OUR WHAT JOKING KALRA ACTS OF.

02:38:07.110 --> 02:38:07.644
WHERE ARE GRANT KIND OF GO ALL

02:38:07.711 --> 02:38:08.245
OVER THE PLACE AND THEY DON'T

02:38:08.312 --> 02:38:10.214
HAVE THE HUMILITY. AND SO WE'RE

02:38:10.280 --> 02:38:12.983
TO HAVE A CALL. COOKIE SAID

02:38:13.050 --> 02:38:14.284
APPROACH THAT CAN BE CAN I.

02:38:14.351 --> 02:38:16.119

ABOUT FEW MORE MINUTES LEFT AND

02:38:27.264 --> 02:38:28.599
I JUST WANNA GET TO A BY. WHAT

02:38:28.665 --> 02:38:29.633
I'M HERE FROM USED A VERY

02:38:29.700 --> 02:38:32.903
STRATEGY. BUT WAIT THERE'S NO.

02:38:32.970 --> 02:38:35.839
METRICS THIS STRATEGY MENTIONED.

02:38:35.906 --> 02:38:37.841
THE CARBON IS AND HOW. SO YOU

02:38:37.908 --> 02:38:38.976
THE FORCE CAR PLAN YOU DON'T

02:38:39.042 --> 02:38:41.411
YEAH HAVE A PLAN TO HARDEN IT

02:38:41.478 --> 02:38:42.746
TO ME HOMES AND WHEN I HEARD IS.

02:38:42.813 --> 02:38:44.915
WE'RE LEAVE. WORKING INTO TO

02:38:44.982 --> 02:38:46.950
FIVE TO HOME ON DEFENSE SPACE.

02:38:47.017 --> 02:38:48.619
I DIDN'T HEAR A NUMBER FOR MANY

02:38:48.685 --> 02:38:50.487
FOLKS WE THINK WE'RE HARDEN-

02:38:50.554 --> 02:38:51.955
FROM THE SMALL- OF MONEY IN

02:38:52.022 --> 02:38:52.556
HERE I THINK TWENTY FIVE. MAY

02:38:52.623 --> 02:38:55.859
MAYBE TRYING TO LEVERAGE- BUT

02:38:55.926 --> 02:38:57.160
HOW MANY HOMES YOU THINK YOU'RE

02:38:57.227 --> 02:38:59.396
GOING TO GET TO. A FROM THIS

02:38:59.463 --> 02:39:01.665
PLAN- I APPRECIATE THE WORK

02:39:01.732 --> 02:39:03.367
FORCE NUMBERS THAT THAT THAT'S

02:39:03.433 --> 02:39:08.071
USEFUL BUT- I GUESS I'M I'M-

02:39:08.138 --> 02:39:10.540
YOU KNOW. SHE WE- TO GET TO

02:39:10.607 --> 02:39:13.043
RESILIENCE DO YOU KNOW HOW FAR.

02:39:13.110 --> 02:39:14.077
IT DO WE HAVE A DELIVERY DOLLAR

02:39:14.144 --> 02:39:16.446
ESTIMATE FOR HOW FAR BEHIND WE

02:39:16.513 --> 02:39:18.448
ARE TO GET TO RESILIENCE. SO

02:39:18.515 --> 02:39:20.117
LIKE I SAID IF YOU'RE GONNA TRY

02:39:20.183 --> 02:39:21.418
TO RETROFIT ALL OF THOSE TWO

02:39:21.485 --> 02:39:22.853
MILLION HOMES THAT'S TWO

02:39:22.920 --> 02:39:24.588
HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS ALONE

02:39:24.655 --> 02:39:26.290
ON THAT FRONT. RIGHT IT'S THE

02:39:26.356 --> 02:39:29.526
LANDSCAPE TO AND IT'S YEAH BYE

02:39:29.593 --> 02:39:32.095
SO. ALL IN WHAT ARE WE SHORT

02:39:32.162 --> 02:39:34.164
YOU GUYS HAVE A SENSE. I MEAN

02:39:34.231 --> 02:39:36.667
YOU'RE LOOKING AT. RIGHT IS SO

02:39:36.733 --> 02:39:38.802
IT JUST IT I THINK THE REALITY

02:39:38.869 --> 02:39:40.570
IS THAT WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO

02:39:40.637 --> 02:39:41.672
MAKE THESE INVESTMENTS

02:39:41.738 --> 02:39:42.506
STRATEGICALLY I MEAN THEY

02:39:42.572 --> 02:39:43.540
EXPIRE CRISIS DOESN'T FIT

02:39:43.607 --> 02:39:46.276
NEATLY INTO A BUDGET CYCLE. AND

02:39:46.343 --> 02:39:48.178
BUT WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO WORK

02:39:48.245 --> 02:39:49.413
STRATEGICALLY SO THAT THESE

02:39:49.479 --> 02:39:51.214
INVESTMENTS ACTUALLY START

02:39:51.281 --> 02:39:52.950
DELIVERING ON PUBLIC SAFETY AND

02:39:53.016 --> 02:39:53.951
SECURITY I MEAN WE SAW

02:39:54.017 --> 02:39:55.485
STRATEGIC FUEL BREAKS. THIS

02:39:55.552 --> 02:39:57.487
LAST YEAR IN THE FACE OF FOUR

02:39:57.554 --> 02:39:58.956
MILLION ACRES BURNING WITH OUR

02:39:59.022 --> 02:40:01.058
FIRE CREWS COMPLETELY STRETCHED

02:40:01.124 --> 02:40:02.592
OUT TO THE MAX AND TO BE ABLE

02:40:02.659 --> 02:40:04.795
TO KEEP PACE WITH THESE FIRES-

02:40:04.861 --> 02:40:06.563
WE FASTER HE FEEL GREAT STATE.

02:40:06.630 --> 02:40:07.464
YOU KNOW WHOLE TOWNS IN THE

02:40:07.531 --> 02:40:10.701
FACE OF REALLY INTENSIVE- FIRES

02:40:10.767 --> 02:40:12.202
WE SAW THEM SERVICE ESCAPE

02:40:12.269 --> 02:40:14.371
ROUTES WE SAW A HARDENED- YOU

02:40:14.438 --> 02:40:15.539
KNOW COMMUNITIES WHERE HOMES

02:40:15.605 --> 02:40:16.940
HAD BEEN HARD WORK ACTIVELY

02:40:17.007 --> 02:40:18.308
REALLY MAKE THOSE IMPACTS. IN

02:40:18.375 --> 02:40:20.310
THE END IT'S NOT JUST THE STATE

02:40:20.377 --> 02:40:21.578
DOLLARS RATE WE'RE REALLY

02:40:21.645 --> 02:40:22.546
GRATEFUL FOR THE PARTNERSHIP

02:40:22.612 --> 02:40:23.513
WITH THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER

02:40:23.580 --> 02:40:25.082
THAT WAS ANNOUNCED YESTERDAY.
