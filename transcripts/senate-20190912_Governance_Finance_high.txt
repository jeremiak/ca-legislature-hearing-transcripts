ARE IN OLD RETAILERS MARLYS INDUSTRY BECAUSE WE MAKE SURE THAT YOU KNOW THAT THESE FUNDS ARE COLLECTED AND GO TO THE PLACE THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE IT'S JUST A MORE COMPLICATED ON PREPAID THAT IT IS. THROUGH YOUR YOUR NORMAL CONTRACTUAL I ALSO WAS ASKED BY OUR COLLEAGUES TO BEAUTY SERVICES TO EXPRESS THEIR SUPPORT. THEY REPRESENT THE HUNDRED OR SO THIS USE THAT TO COLLECT THESE.

DO WE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FROM MY COLLEAGUES. BILL CENTRE BELL. NOT FOR NOW BUT THIS IS GOING TO BE WORKED ON BETWEEN NOW AND NEXT YEAR I THINK IT'S VERY ANALYZE THE IMPACT ON. LOW INCOME RESIDENTS ESPECIALLY PEOPLE ON FIXED INCOMES PEOPLE THAT HAVE. I KNOW PEOPLE HAVE DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES TYPICALLY USE THESE TYPES OF PHONES SO I'VE I'VE JUST WANTED A SIGNAL THAT ARE OUT THERE SO WE CAN. EXPLORE OBJECT OF WHETHER WHETHER OR NOT WE SHOULD ACCOMMODATE SOME CONCERN ABOUT THAT. SO I'M JUST RISEN OUT NOW SO YOU'RE AWARE OF THAT. AND MAYBE DO SOME RESEARCH THE TIME. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS MISTER KIRK SINCE THIS IS YOUR LAST MEETING I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS FOR YOU. THE S. SENATOR SAID THAT IS TWENTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IN SALES PER YEAR. I AND I'M SHOWING THAT IT RAISES SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN. UTILITY TAX IS THAT ACCURATE THAT'S THE COMMITTEE COMMITTEE CONSULTS ANALYSIS WHICH JACKSON WAS VERY GOOD. RATED THAT IS ACCURATE IN THAT ARE SEVEN HUNDRED THAT'S WHAT SEVEN OF FIFTY THOUSAND A YEAR TO ADMINISTER THE PROGRAM. MY UNDERSTANDING THE SIX MILLION DOLLARS WAS FROM DEPARTMENT OF TAX AND FEE ADMINISTRATION SO THERE WAS THE ANNUAL I BELIEVE THE TWENTY FOUR MILLION AS THE TILL SIX. Q. MOTIVE YEAH. I THINK THE FIRST YEAR THERE WAS SOME. IT TOOK ABOUT A YEAR TO SET UP THE PROGRAM SO I'M I'M I'M LOOKING AT MAYBE FIVE AND IT. POINT TWO FIVE MILLION NET. SO THAT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE A LOT A LOT OF MONEY SO I'M I WANTED MAYBE PUT IT IN CONTEXT SENATOR IT'S- THE INCEPTION. GROWTH WHENEVER SINCE INCEPTION BUT BUT MAYBE SIX MILLION A YEAR AND REVENUES. SO BUT THIS IS JUST FOR CERTAIN MUNICIPALITIES ARE WE- TALKING ABOUT JUST THOSE ON A WESTERNER ONE CITIES IN THREE COUNTIES WHO CURRENTLY COLLECT YOU TEASE. SO AND THOSE ARE DECISIONS ARE MADE BY THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND SELLS SO THERE IS A HUNDRED ONE CALIFORNIA CITIES. AND COUNTIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THIS ONE FOR THE RECORD LITTLE EXPLANATION ON THE PARITY ON WHY YOU HAVE THE TAX FOR THE CARDS. AND IT'S BECAUSE YOU HAVE THE TAX AT THIS PHONE BILLS. YOU COULD JUST EXPLAIN IT JUST FOR THE RECORD MR KERRY GUY COULD PULL THAT THE TAX ME OBVIOUSLY ONE THING IF TAXES. UNIFIED RELATE ACOSTA ACROSS CONSUMERS AND OBVIOUSLY EASIER TO CALL. SOMEONE HAS A PHONE BILL AND THEY'RE THEY'RE PAYING THE PHONE BILL WITH YOUR TO CALL. HER BY REACH UP BERMAN IS CHALLENGING THAT WAS THE REASON FOR AB SEVENTEEN SEVENTY WAS TO HAVE A MECHANISM THAT COULD ACTUALLY WORK. IN THE REACHED ENVIRONMENT AND. TWENTY FOUR MILLION THIS LANCHESTER DID YOU HAVE ANY MORE QUESTIONS JOIN ME TO ASK. OKAY THANKS FOR PASSING THOSE OVER. THE CONGRATULATIONS OF A GREAT RETIREMENT WHICH VERSION ONE ISN'T PASSED YET HE HAS A HE IS RETIRING WE HAD ALL YOUR CARES CAN WE HAD A WE HAD A BIG CEREMONY YOUR BEFORE YOU ARRIVE JUST AND HEARD YOU WERE CARRYING. IF YOU EVER SUPPORT A BILL THAT DIDN'T HAVE TO DO WITH MONEY OR YEP ECONOMY FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SO I THINK IT'S ONE. SHOT BEFORE THE IS TO THE APPROPRIATE THAT WE HATE. PLEASE ASK A QUESTION I'M ASKED. WHY THE HECK WE DOING THIS BILL THE DAY BEFORE LAST LAST DECISION. THIS IS A COMPELLING CASE THIS IS BEEN ON THE MOVE AND OVER IN THE ASSEMBLY AND WE ARE UNABLE TO SPEAK VERY CANDID ABOUT IT. THEY'RE LOOKING AT A LARGER FIX. ON THERE ARE GONNA NEED TO BE SOME CHANGES TO THE RULES AND RAGS THAT HAVE BEEN ADOPTED BACK IN TWO THOUSAND. THAT IS GOING TO BE A HEAVY LIFT WHICH IS GOING TO NEED TO BE ABLE TO TAKE TIME. AND SENATE ADVANCE ONE IMPORTANT ISSUE FOCUS ON THOSE WHO ARE. HAVE CHEN WHO ARE FOR CALIFORNIANS OR FROM THE DD COMMUNITY. AND THAT'S GOING TO MEAN THAT WE'RE GONNA NEED TO SPEND THE FOLLOWING. HOLD BILL THERE'S GONNA BE SOME COMPLEX ISSUES THERE HAVE TO BE TACKLED BUT THE SUNSET. NUMBER THIRTY FIRST OF TWENTY NINETEEN THIS ONLY EXTENDS THE REVENUE PORTION THROUGH JANUARY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWENTY ONE EXCUSE ME SO THAT'S WHY WE'RE TAKING A TWO PRONGED APPROACH TO THIS. THIS BILL IS EMERGENCY ROOM. DON'T AND I DON'T BELIEVE SO WHO IS THE SO OF THE ITEM. HI MY HANDSOME. AND BUT OUR JOB IS TO PARTICULARLY AMONG OUR FRIENDS TO. QUESTIONS THAT'S WERE INTEGRITY LIES AND SO IT'S EASY TO BEAT UP THE PEOPLE YOU DON'T AGREE WITH. BUT I AND MY QUESTION IS OKAY SO THIS GOES INTO EFFECT ON JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY. AREN'T WERE THE LAST DAY I THINK THAT IT. NO WE ALL SCRATCH EACH OTHER'S BACKS TO GET THESE THINGS DONE SOMETIMES IS POLITICAL COMPELLING REASONS AND SOMETIMES IS URGENCY REASONS FOR LITIGATION FOR COPS. WHY COULDN'T YOU PUT THIS ACROSS THE DESK ON THE FIRST OF JANUARY THIRD G. PROVISION AND GET IT PASSED AND- GIVE US A CHANCE TO REALLY THINK ABOUT IT WHAT'S A COMPELLING REASON THERE WAS ANOTHER BILL. THAT WAS. MOVING ON THAT LEFT OUT. LOCAL UTILITY. TAXES AND SO WE ARE HERE TODAY MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE ABLE TO CLEAN THIS UP. AND THE PROGRAM IS ALREADY BEEN SET UP BY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TAX AND FEE ADMINISTRATION. IT THIS WAS ORIGINALLY ESTABLISHED BY AB SEVENTEEN SEVENTEEN I IN THOUSAND FOURTEEN. SO WE'RE SIMPLY EXTENDING THE DEADLINE WHEN IT COMES TO THE TAXES IS AN IMPORTANT TAX REVENUE FOUR HUNDRED ONE CITIES IN THREE COUNTIES. IN THE STATE AND I THINK THE OTHER REALLY IMPORTANT PART OF THIS BILL THIS IS GENERAL FUND. NEUTRAL THERE'S NO COST. AS THE DOLLAR COMING FROM THE- PLEASE TAXES ARE ALSO REIMBURSING THE GENERAL FUND THE CROSSING. WE DO THAT I MAY MAKE. I THINK YOU HAD A DEBATE JUST EXTENDING THE SUCH A YEAR WELL WE CAN CON THE LARGER LARGER PIECES. AND WE WOULD HAVE MUCH RATHER OF HAD. IN BUDGET QUITE. CANDIDLY L. AND FORTUNATELY I NOT MAKE IT. WE ACTUALLY ASKED THAT IS. TAKEN UP TO WHICH TO CUT IT. TOOK A LITTLE TIME IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OPTED NOT TO INCLUDED WITH THE NINE ONE ONE PIECE OF THIS AND FOR. YOU KNOW FOR THEIR OWN REASONS AND SO THEN WE HAD TO KIND OF STEP BACK INTO TO DO IT SEPARATELY. WE HAD HOPED IT WOULD BE DONE IN THE BUDGET BUT. AND THEY WERE JUST TO ASK THE GOOD CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE TO. IF HIS CLOSING REMARKS. I THANK YOU FOR YOUR THANKS TO OBTAIN BEARD AT PRESENT IN AGAIN THAT WE WILL BE BACK TACKLE IN THE LARGER ISSUE NEXT YEAR IN ORDER PROCEED AN AYE VOTE ON THIS SIMPLE SUNSET EXTENSION. GOOD ADAM.
