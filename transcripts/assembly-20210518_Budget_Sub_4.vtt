01:45:54.748 --> 01:45:56.650
THE DYSFUNCTION IN OUR SOCIETY

01:45:56.717 --> 01:45:58.785
MR LAW ENFORCEMENT I THINK IT'S

01:45:58.852 --> 01:45:59.686
VERY UNFORTUNATE BECAUSE IT'S

01:45:59.753 --> 01:46:03.657
VERY- IT'S VERY INEFFECTIVE.

01:46:03.724 --> 01:46:05.692
AND IT'S VERY VERY TEMPORARY.

01:46:05.759 --> 01:46:08.462
AND I THINK THE HOUSING FOCUS

01:46:08.528 --> 01:46:10.363
IS ALSO TEMPORARY AND I THINK

01:46:10.430 --> 01:46:12.232
WELL WHAT WE NEED TO TRY TO DO

01:46:12.299 --> 01:46:14.868
IS TO SHIFTED. OUR OUR SERVICES

01:46:14.935 --> 01:46:17.871
SUPPORT FIRST- BECAUSE WE AS AS

01:46:17.938 --> 01:46:21.108
YOU KNOW THAT. A LARGE SHARE OF

01:46:21.174 --> 01:46:23.877
OUR HOMELESS POPULATION. BATTLE

01:46:23.944 --> 01:46:26.146
MENTAL ILLNESS ADDICTIONS AND

01:46:26.213 --> 01:46:28.048
ADAPTIVE BEHAVIOR DISORDERS AND

01:46:28.115 --> 01:46:30.317
I FEEL LIKE I DON'T SEE A WHOLE

01:46:30.383 --> 01:46:34.354
LOT OF. BUNDY GOING IN THAT

01:46:34.421 --> 01:46:35.722
DIRECTION AND I DON'T SEE A LOT

01:46:35.789 --> 01:46:38.692
OF PLANNING GOING IN THAT

01:46:38.759 --> 01:46:39.593
DIRECTION I THINK THAT THAT IS

01:46:39.659 --> 01:46:42.262
REALLY. HOW WE GET AT THE HEART

01:46:42.329 --> 01:46:43.563
OF THIS PROBLEM AND I THINK

01:46:43.630 --> 01:46:45.298
PART OF THE REASON WHY WE DON'T

01:46:45.365 --> 01:46:45.999
IS BECAUSE IT'S MUCH MORE

01:46:46.066 --> 01:46:48.835
DIFFICULT. AND I THINK IT'S

01:46:48.902 --> 01:46:51.238
TIME THAT WE RECOGNIZE THAT THE

01:46:51.304 --> 01:46:54.007
SERVICES. ARE UNDER EMPATHIZED

01:46:54.074 --> 01:46:56.777
AND I REALLY REALLY WOULD HOPE.

01:46:56.843 --> 01:46:59.513
THAT WE WOULD- START FOCUSING

01:46:59.579 --> 01:47:02.249
OUR ATTENTION ON THE DEMANDS OF

01:47:02.315 --> 01:47:04.151
THESE PROBLEMS AND TO ACTUALLY

01:47:04.217 --> 01:47:06.553
ADDRESS SERVICES FIRST SUPPORT

01:47:06.620 --> 01:47:07.854
SERVICES FOR SO THAT WE CAN

01:47:07.921 --> 01:47:10.157
HAVE SUSTAINABLE. RECOVERY WE

01:47:10.223 --> 01:47:11.825
CAN GET WE CAN GET SOMEBODY A

01:47:11.892 --> 01:47:13.260
PLACE TO STAY BUT IT'S NOT

01:47:13.326 --> 01:47:15.262
SUSTAINABLE UNLESS THEY HAVE.

01:47:15.328 --> 01:47:17.230
THE SKILLS AND THE TOOLS TO

01:47:17.297 --> 01:47:19.933
ADAPT. TO LIFE AND I'M HOPING

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.569
THAT- WE CAN SEE MORE FUNDING

01:47:22.636 --> 01:47:24.271
AND MORE ORGANIZATION IN THAT

01:47:24.337 --> 01:47:26.273
DIRECTION BECAUSE- IF IT

01:47:26.339 --> 01:47:28.809
DOESN'T AND THIS PLAN IT'S HARD

01:47:28.875 --> 01:47:31.111
TO SEE. AND I THINK THAT'S A

01:47:31.178 --> 01:47:32.746
PROBLEM IT SHOULDN'T BE HARD TO

01:47:32.813 --> 01:47:34.848
SEE IT SHOULD BE BALANCED WITH

01:47:34.915 --> 01:47:37.584
THE WITH THE HOUSING. COMPONENT

01:47:37.651 --> 01:47:39.085
AND SO THOSE ARE JUST MY

01:47:39.152 --> 01:47:40.120
THOUGHTS YET YOU DON'T HAVE TO

01:47:40.187 --> 01:47:42.122
ANSWER THAT IT'S JUST A

01:47:42.189 --> 01:47:43.256
PERSPECTIVE I THINK IS VERY

01:47:43.323 --> 01:47:46.493
VERY CRITICAL AND I HOPE THAT-

01:47:46.560 --> 01:47:47.761
WE COULD SEE SOME ADAPT SOME OF

01:47:47.828 --> 01:47:51.865

THE RICH AND POOR. AND THIS

02:22:37.649 --> 02:22:39.784
BUDGET REALLY- LACES STRATEGIC

02:22:39.851 --> 02:22:41.920
INVESTMENTS IN HOW WE DELIVER

RESILIENCE FUND FOCUSED ON

02:22:50.762 --> 02:22:52.664
BOTTOM UP PLANNING FOR EACH

REGION RECOGNIZING THAT ONE

02:22:54.832 --> 02:22:57.035
SIZE DOESN'T FIT ALL AND THAT

02:22:57.101 --> 02:22:59.037
WE HAVE TO BE INTENTIONAL ABOUT

02:22:59.103 --> 02:23:00.571
WHAT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND

02:23:00.638 --> 02:23:02.006
GROWTH ARE GONNA LOOK LIKE WE

02:23:02.073 --> 02:23:03.408
HAVE TO BE INTENTIONAL ABOUT

02:23:03.474 --> 02:23:05.476
JOB CREATION. IN THE LANGUAGE

02:23:05.543 --> 02:23:06.911
OF ECONOMIST WE HAVE TO THINK

02:23:06.978 --> 02:23:08.346
ABOUT THE DEMAND SIDE FOR

02:23:08.413 --> 02:23:10.515
LABOR. AND THE GOVERNOR'S PLAN

HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS

02:23:14.052 --> 02:23:15.553
TO GET WORKERS INTO THOSE GOOD

EDGES AND I WORKFORCE AGENCIES

02:23:20.591 --> 02:23:21.859
IT'S ABOUT TRANSFORMING OUR

02:23:21.926 --> 02:23:23.628
WORKFORCE SYSTEM SO THAT WE ARE

02:23:23.695 --> 02:23:25.997
TRULY PREPARING WORKERS FOR THE

02:23:26.064 --> 02:23:27.598
JOBS OF THE FUTURE WE'RE

02:23:27.665 --> 02:23:29.500
MEETING EMPLOYER NEEDS AND

02:23:29.567 --> 02:23:31.402
WE'RE COMBATING THE SYSTEMIC

02:23:31.469 --> 02:23:33.671
EXCLUSION OF THOSE WHO. WALKING

02:23:33.738 --> 02:23:35.907
BEHIND EVEN IN GOOD TIMES SO

02:23:35.974 --> 02:23:37.942
THIS IS ABOUT THE SUPPLY SIDE

02:23:38.009 --> 02:23:40.144
OF LABOR AND WE CANNOT DO JUST

02:23:40.211 --> 02:23:41.479
ONE WE HAVE TO DO BOTH OF THOSE

02:23:41.546 --> 02:23:43.147
THINGS AND THIS BUDGET REFLECTS

02:23:43.214 --> 02:23:45.249
THAT SO EACH OF THESE TWO

02:23:45.316 --> 02:23:46.918
PIECES HAS TWO CATEGORIES UNDER

02:23:46.985 --> 02:23:49.320
IT- SO REALLY FOUR PIECES THAT

02:23:49.387 --> 02:23:50.922
COMPLEMENT ONE ANOTHER THAT ARE

02:23:50.989 --> 02:23:52.357
THAT ARE REALLY INTERLOCKING.

02:23:52.423 --> 02:23:54.592
SO FIRST ON THE SEVEN HUNDRED

02:23:54.659 --> 02:23:55.626
FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR FUND THIS

02:23:55.693 --> 02:23:57.595
IS AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN ACT

02:23:57.662 --> 02:23:59.364
FUNDING THAT WOULD TREAT THIS

02:23:59.430 --> 02:24:01.399
COMMUNITY ECONOMIC RESILIENCE

02:24:01.466 --> 02:24:03.601
FUND THE TWO COMPONENTS ONE IS

02:24:03.668 --> 02:24:05.303
PLANNING IT WILL PROVIDE

02:24:05.370 --> 02:24:07.038
PLANNING GRANTS TO EACH OF THE

02:24:07.105 --> 02:24:08.773
STATE'S REGION'S RECOGNIZING

02:24:08.840 --> 02:24:10.241
THAT I SAID THAT ECONOMIC

02:24:10.308 --> 02:24:10.975
DEVELOPMENT AND GROWTH

02:24:11.042 --> 02:24:12.410
STRATEGIES HAVE TO COME BOTTOM

02:24:12.477 --> 02:24:13.878
UP BY THOSE WHO KNOW THE

02:24:13.945 --> 02:24:15.313
REGION'S BEST WHO KNOW THEIR

02:24:15.380 --> 02:24:17.482
ASSET ASSETS WHO CAN ALIGN THE

02:24:17.548 --> 02:24:19.317
REGION'S. STRENGTHS ALONG WITH

02:24:19.384 --> 02:24:21.319
THEIR CHALLENGES WHO CAN LOOK

02:24:21.386 --> 02:24:22.220
AT HOW TO ECONOMICALLY

02:24:22.286 --> 02:24:23.821
DIVERSIFY EACH REGION FOR

02:24:23.888 --> 02:24:26.190
LONGER TERM RESILIENCE AND THAT

02:24:26.257 --> 02:24:27.792
WILL ALSO REFLECT THE

02:24:27.859 --> 02:24:28.993
ADMINISTRATION'S COMMITMENT TO

02:24:29.060 --> 02:24:31.362
CLIMATE AND EQUITY AND ACCESS

02:24:31.429 --> 02:24:34.699
SO- THE THAT THAT FUNDING WILL

02:24:34.766 --> 02:24:36.667
GO TOWARD HIGH ROAD TRANSITION

02:24:36.734 --> 02:24:38.803
COLLABORATIVE'S WORKER VOICES

02:24:38.870 --> 02:24:40.338

ACROSS CALIFORNIA'S DIVERSE

02:24:46.711 --> 02:24:47.478
REGIONS THE BILL AND QUEST LIKE

02:24:47.545 --> 02:24:49.414
WILL WE THE JOB OF ARGUE. WHERE

WILL THE JOBS COME FROM SO THE

02:24:51.482 --> 02:24:52.784
FIRST PART OF THAT IS PLANNING

02:24:52.850 --> 02:24:54.886
GRANTS THE SECOND PART OF THAT

02:24:54.952 --> 02:24:57.722
AGAIN THE TO UNDER THE FUND THE

02:24:57.789 --> 02:24:59.257
SECOND PIECE OF IMPLEMENTATION

02:24:59.323 --> 02:25:01.626
OF THE PLANS THAT COME. INTO

SAY IS THAT WE'RE REALLY

02:39:39.903 --> 02:39:41.171
THINKING ABOUT A LOT OF

02:39:41.238 --> 02:39:42.839
DIFFERENT CALIFORNIANS HERE NOT

02:39:52.582 --> 02:39:53.750
TRANSITION IS NORTHWEST

02:39:53.817 --> 02:39:55.585
CATEGORY. IN WHICH WE'RE

02:39:55.652 --> 02:39:56.653

02:40:05.529 --> 02:40:07.030
EFFORT TO ENSURE THAT. HI ROAD

02:40:07.097 --> 02:40:08.532
OR JUST TRANSITION IS NOT JUST

02:40:08.598 --> 02:40:10.600
SOLELY FOR WORKERS THAT ARE-

02:40:10.667 --> 02:40:11.635
WHOSE INDUSTRIES MAY BE

02:40:11.702 --> 02:40:13.337
IMPACTED. BUT THAT WE ARE ALSO

02:40:13.403 --> 02:40:16.073
CREATING A PIPELINE OF NEW WORK

02:40:16.139 --> 02:40:17.874
FORCE. SOME CURIOUS AS TO WHAT

02:40:17.941 --> 02:40:19.276
THE DIRECTION IS GOING TO BE

02:40:19.343 --> 02:40:21.678
FOR OUR CAPE THROUGH FOURTEEN.

02:40:21.745 --> 02:40:23.647
EDUCATION SYSTEM TO ENSURE THAT

02:40:23.714 --> 02:40:26.049
AS YOU WORK ON A PLAN. WE ARE

02:40:26.116 --> 02:40:28.819

02:40:31.989 --> 02:40:34.191
JOB A GOOD SALARY AND AN

02:40:34.257 --> 02:40:34.725

BACK TO. SECRETARY OF STATE. I

02:40:43.400 --> 02:40:45.669
THINK THAT. IF YOU LOOK AT THE

02:40:45.736 --> 02:40:47.437
PROPOSAL BUILDING JUST

02:40:47.504 --> 02:40:48.472
TRANSITION COLLABORATIVE

02:40:48.538 --> 02:40:50.307
ALLOWING REGIONS TO DECIDE WHAT

02:40:50.374 --> 02:40:51.775
THEIR ECONOMIES LOOK BY. THE

02:40:51.842 --> 02:40:53.810
WAY THAT WE GET. FROM THE

02:40:53.877 --> 02:40:55.545
EQUITY QUESTIONS AND BROAD

02:40:55.612 --> 02:40:58.081
QUESTIONS OF- OF. ECONOMIC AND

02:40:58.148 --> 02:41:00.283
WORKFORCE PIPELINES IS THAT IT

02:41:00.350 --> 02:41:02.052
IS SETTING THE STATE'S ROLE IS

02:41:02.119 --> 02:41:03.453
TO SET AN INCREASE OF TABLE THE

02:41:03.520 --> 02:41:05.822
STATE'S ROLE IS TO ENSURE THAT

02:41:05.889 --> 02:41:08.025
WE ARE- PUTTING SOME GUARD

02:41:08.091 --> 02:41:08.959
RAILS ON THE WORK WHENEVER WE

02:41:09.026 --> 02:41:10.894
INVEST MONEY DOESN'T. CHEAT BOT

02:41:10.961 --> 02:41:13.030
SUSTAINABILITY GOALS THE CHIEF

02:41:13.096 --> 02:41:14.664
EQUITY METRICS DOESN'T ACHIEVE

02:41:14.731 --> 02:41:17.034
JOB QUALITY METRICS. THAT

02:41:17.100 --> 02:41:19.469
REMAINS TO BE DETERMINED BUT I

02:41:19.536 --> 02:41:21.038
THINK THEY STILL HAVEN'T

02:41:21.104 --> 02:41:22.739
GONZALEZ SO THE TABLE AT WHICH

02:41:22.806 --> 02:41:24.408
LABOR COSTS TO BE PRESENT AT

02:41:24.474 --> 02:41:27.310
WHICH COMMUNITY GROUPS- ARE

02:41:27.377 --> 02:41:29.012
REALLY GROUND LEVEL ECONOMIC

02:41:29.079 --> 02:41:30.781
EQUITY GROUPS ARE INVOLVED IN

02:41:30.847 --> 02:41:32.215
THE VOICES OF WORKERS INVOICES

02:41:32.282 --> 02:41:33.650
A COMMUNITIES. AND RESIDENTS

02:41:33.717 --> 02:41:35.185
ARE ALL PARTICIPATING AS WELL

02:41:35.252 --> 02:41:38.321

FORMS OF WORKER VOICE AS WELL

02:41:43.460 --> 02:41:45.896
AS THE WORKFORCE BOARDS- AND

02:41:45.962 --> 02:41:47.264
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL SO

02:41:47.330 --> 02:41:48.465
IT'S A BIG TABLE THERE'S ROOM

02:41:48.532 --> 02:41:49.199
FOR EVERYONE TO HAVE THEIR

02:41:49.266 --> 02:41:51.234
VOICE IN THIS. AND THAT IS THE

02:41:51.301 --> 02:41:54.404
WAY THAT WE- DECIDED THAT- OR

02:41:54.471 --> 02:41:56.073
THAT WE ENSURE THAT THERE ARE

02:41:56.139 --> 02:41:58.008
NONE BOB BROUGHT ACCESS TO

02:41:58.075 --> 02:41:59.509
THESE JOBS AND I WILL ALSO SAY

02:41:59.576 --> 02:42:00.177
THAT THE HIGHER TRAINING

02:42:00.243 --> 02:42:02.212
PARTNERSHIPS. REALLY ENSURE

02:42:02.279 --> 02:42:03.847
THAT NOT ONLY INCOME BUT

02:42:03.914 --> 02:42:04.848
WORKERS BUT THAT THERE ARE

02:42:04.915 --> 02:42:06.383
COMPLAINTS IAN FOR PEOPLE

THAT'S- COULD NOT HAVE ACCESS

02:42:07.984 --> 02:42:09.486
SCHOOLS GOOD JOBS YET SO IT IS

02:42:09.553 --> 02:42:11.154
IT IS. PART AND PARCEL OF THE

02:42:11.221 --> 02:42:14.891
HARDWOOD VISION. THAT- THAT

02:42:14.958 --> 02:42:16.693
THESE PIPELINES SPENDING ACCESS

02:42:16.760 --> 02:42:30.540

BE. REGION'S WE YOU KNOW WE SAY

02:43:02.005 --> 02:43:02.472
BOTTOM UP PLANNING BECAUSE

EVERY REGION HAS HAS DIFFERENT

02:43:04.441 --> 02:43:05.342
ASSET THERE ARE DIFFERENT

02:43:05.408 --> 02:43:06.376
CHALLENGES THEIR DIFFERENT

02:43:06.443 --> 02:43:07.511
STATES OF TRANSITION THERE ALSO

02:43:07.577 --> 02:43:08.578
IN DIFFERENT STATES IN TERMS

02:43:08.645 --> 02:43:11.047
OF. HOW FAR ALONG. THEY ARE IN

02:43:11.114 --> 02:43:12.249
A YOU HAVE YET TO HAVE ALREADY

02:43:12.315 --> 02:43:14.551

THERE HAS TO BE MANAGED BUT

02:43:21.057 --> 02:43:23.426
THERE HAS TO BE UP COMMUNITY.

02:43:23.493 --> 02:43:25.929
AND AND BEYOND THAT BUT WE

02:43:25.996 --> 02:43:27.697
EXPECT THAT THE REGION'S ASKED

02:43:27.764 --> 02:43:28.698
YOU KNOW SO OFTEN THE CASE WHEN

02:43:28.765 --> 02:43:29.599

THAT THAT THERE ARE- THAT THERE

02:43:32.802 --> 02:43:35.405
THAT THERE WILL BE IDEAS THAT

02:43:35.472 --> 02:43:36.173
DEVELOP THAT THEN WE WANT TO

02:43:36.239 --> 02:43:38.308

TO ADDRESS YOU KNOW I THINK ON

02:43:44.414 --> 02:43:45.649
THE ON THE KEY TO FOURTEEN

02:43:45.715 --> 02:43:47.284
PIECE. SO YOU KNOW THERE WILL

02:43:47.350 --> 02:43:49.085
BE A PLANNING PROCESS BUT THE

02:43:49.152 --> 02:43:49.920
REASON I SAY THIS- FOR

02:43:49.986 --> 02:43:51.054
INTERLOCKING COMPONENTS BUT THE

FIFTY. FIVE HUNDRED ONE DOLLARS

02:44:00.664 --> 02:44:02.065
INVESTMENTS HERE IN COMMUNITY

02:44:02.132 --> 02:44:04.167
COLLEGES PARTNERING SO THAT

02:44:04.234 --> 02:44:06.403
THEIR ROLE IS CLEAR TO WRITE SO

02:44:06.469 --> 02:44:08.205
THAT SO THAT YOU KNOW WHEN WE

THESE ARE ALL ALSO- PART OF ONE

02:44:15.011 --> 02:44:16.413

DRIVING THE SAME TO. SO THAT'S

02:44:30.026 --> 02:44:31.061
WHY THERE'S SO MANY PIECES TO

02:44:31.127 --> 02:44:32.195
IT. AND WHAT WE SEE IN THE

02:44:32.262 --> 02:44:33.863

OF A LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS AND

02:46:00.383 --> 02:46:02.252
WE COULD SAY IT DEPENDING ON

02:46:02.319 --> 02:46:04.220
HOW THE RELATIVES SEVEN TEN

02:46:04.287 --> 02:46:05.689

03:39:37.464 --> 03:39:39.266
IT SEEMS AS WE ARE GETTING INTO

03:39:39.332 --> 03:39:42.035
THE STAGE OF COMPLETE RE

03:39:42.102 --> 03:39:44.571
OPENING WITH FULL VACCINATION

03:39:44.638 --> 03:39:45.805
AND THE STATE IS DOING REALLY

03:39:45.872 --> 03:39:48.241
WELL COMPARATIVELY ACROSS THE

03:39:48.308 --> 03:39:50.377
STATE ASKING FOR NINETY FIVE

03:39:50.443 --> 03:39:51.711
MILLION WHEN FOLKS ARE ALREADY

03:39:51.778 --> 03:39:53.780
WILLING AND READY TO TRAVEL I'M

03:39:53.847 --> 03:39:55.015
JUST CURIOUS AS TO WHAT THE

03:39:55.081 --> 03:39:57.484
DIRECTION IS IN TERMS OF HOW

03:39:57.551 --> 03:39:58.051
THAT FUNDING IS GOING TO BE

03:39:58.118 --> 03:40:00.420
USED IN- EXACTLY YOU'RE

03:40:00.487 --> 03:40:02.856
TARGETING. AND IF WE ARE IN THE

03:40:02.923 --> 03:40:04.457
PROCESS OF ALSO RECOVERING FROM

03:40:04.524 --> 03:40:06.660
COAL BED. WHILE OTHER STATES

03:40:06.726 --> 03:40:09.696
ARE NOT AT THAT LEVEL. I'M

03:40:09.763 --> 03:40:12.432
CONCERNED AS TO WHAT THAT.

03:40:12.499 --> 03:40:13.033
ATTENTION WE CAN LOOK LIKE FOR

03:40:13.099 --> 03:40:16.770
THE STATE. SO WE THANK YOU FOR

03:40:16.836 --> 03:40:18.338
THAT QUESTION IT'S EXCELLENT

03:40:18.405 --> 03:40:20.774
WEEK WE HAVE A SERIOUS ISSUE IN

03:40:20.840 --> 03:40:23.009
CALIFORNIA AS IT RELATES TO

03:40:23.076 --> 03:40:24.911
COMING OUT OF THIS PANDEMIC

03:40:24.978 --> 03:40:26.913
CALIFORNIA LOST MORE MARKET

03:40:26.980 --> 03:40:29.015
SHARE THAN ANY OTHER STATE IN

03:40:29.082 --> 03:40:30.884
THE CONTINENTAL US WE ACTUALLY

03:40:30.951 --> 03:40:34.788
LOST 26% OF OUR SHARE BECAUSE-

03:40:34.854 --> 03:40:36.623
WE TOOK A VERY CAUTIOUS

03:40:36.690 --> 03:40:38.091
APPROACH HERE IN CALIFORNIA

03:40:38.158 --> 03:40:40.126
DURING THE PANDEMIC. BUT AT THE

03:40:40.193 --> 03:40:42.596
SAME TIME IT SENT A SIGNAL TO

03:40:42.662 --> 03:40:44.698
THE NATION THAT WE WERE NOT

03:40:44.764 --> 03:40:46.766
OPEN FOR BUSINESS SO FOR THE

03:40:46.833 --> 03:40:48.168
FIRST TIME IN HISTORY WE

03:40:48.234 --> 03:40:49.603
ACTUALLY LAGGED BEHIND

03:40:49.669 --> 03:40:51.338
COMPETITIVE STATES IN TERMS OF

03:40:51.404 --> 03:40:53.306
THAT TOP OF MIND AWARENESS OR

03:40:53.373 --> 03:40:55.241
WHAT WE CALL DESTINATION READY

03:40:55.308 --> 03:40:57.744
NESS IN TERMS OF. ARE PEOPLE

03:40:57.811 --> 03:40:59.746
LOOKING THAT IS CALIFORNIA

03:40:59.813 --> 03:41:01.181
READY FOR THAT OPEN FOR

03:41:01.247 --> 03:41:03.550
BUSINESS MESSAGING AND THAT

03:41:03.617 --> 03:41:05.685
THAT TAKES AN EXTRAORDINARY

03:41:05.752 --> 03:41:08.121
EFFORT TO COME FROM BEHIND TO

03:41:08.188 --> 03:41:09.656
DO SO WHAT OTHER STATES

03:41:09.723 --> 03:41:11.758
ACTUALLY MADE UP SHARE DURING

03:41:11.825 --> 03:41:14.694
THE PANDEMIC SO AGAIN OUR

03:41:14.761 --> 03:41:17.564
TARGET IS RESTORING CONSUMER

03:41:17.631 --> 03:41:20.300
CONFIDENCE THE CALIFORNIA IS

03:41:20.367 --> 03:41:22.402
READY AND OPEN FOR BUSINESS AT

03:41:22.469 --> 03:41:24.704
THIS TIME WHEN THE COMPETITION

03:41:24.771 --> 03:41:27.874
IS ADDED TO YOUR SUS POINT. AND

03:41:27.941 --> 03:41:29.442
THAT'S WHAT THE MONEY WILL BE

03:41:29.509 --> 03:41:31.244
USED FOR AND CREATE A

03:41:31.311 --> 03:41:33.246
DIFFERENCE I WILL NOTE THAT

03:41:33.313 --> 03:41:34.714
THERE IS STILL INDUSTRY

03:41:34.781 --> 03:41:37.350
INVESTMENT AND THE ONLY WAY

03:41:37.417 --> 03:41:40.587
THAT WE CAN FULLY RECOVER IS TO

03:41:40.654 --> 03:41:42.889
MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A FULL

03:41:42.956 --> 03:41:44.891
THROTTLE APPROACH TO SHORTEN

03:41:44.958 --> 03:41:47.794
THAT RECOVERY KERR SO OUR

03:41:47.861 --> 03:41:49.496
GATEWAY CITIES SAN FRANCISCO

03:41:49.562 --> 03:41:52.165
LOS ANGELES ORANGE COUNTY SAN

03:41:52.232 --> 03:41:54.167
DIEGO SUFFERED THE MOST OUR

03:41:54.234 --> 03:41:56.102
URBAN CORES. SO PART OF OUR

03:41:56.169 --> 03:41:58.538
INVESTMENT IS TO DOUBLE DOWN ON

03:41:58.605 --> 03:42:00.240
AND URBAN LAYER TAKE AND

03:42:00.306 --> 03:42:02.375
RESTORE CONFIDENCE AND TOP OF

03:42:02.442 --> 03:42:04.110
MIND AWARENESS FOR THOSE URBAN

03:42:04.177 --> 03:42:06.813
CORES. THANK YOU AND I 1100%

03:42:06.880 --> 03:42:08.515
APPRECIATE THAT THE RESTORE

03:42:08.581 --> 03:42:11.051
CONFIDENCE CALIFORNIA HAS LED

03:42:11.117 --> 03:42:12.686
THE WAY IN TERMS OF COBIT

03:42:12.752 --> 03:42:16.156
RECOVERY. AN OPENING AND WE'RE

03:42:16.222 --> 03:42:16.756
GOING AND WHERE DO A LOT OF

03:42:16.823 --> 03:42:17.357
WORK TO ENSURE THAT ARE SMALL

03:42:17.424 --> 03:42:19.025
BUSINESSES HAVE THE FUNDING AND

03:42:19.092 --> 03:42:20.427
RESOURCES THAT THEY NEED AS

03:42:20.493 --> 03:42:22.529
MUCH AS WE ARE ALSO WORKING ON

03:42:22.595 --> 03:42:24.230
THE EQUITY ISSUE WITH VACCINE

03:42:24.297 --> 03:42:26.933
WHICH WE'RE SLOWLY. GETTING TO

03:42:27.000 --> 03:42:28.435
A GOOD PLACE ON AND I CAN TELL

03:42:28.501 --> 03:42:29.536
YOU THAT IN MY OWN PARTICULAR

03:42:29.602 --> 03:42:31.771
DISTRICT. OF MANY ESSENTIAL

03:42:31.838 --> 03:42:34.007
WORKERS AND MOST OF WHOM ARE

03:42:34.074 --> 03:42:36.042
LATINO SUFFERED THE MOST AND SO

03:42:36.109 --> 03:42:37.677
WHEN I WHEN I HEAR YOU SAY

03:42:37.744 --> 03:42:40.447
ABOUT. IN YOU KNOW OTHER STATES

03:42:40.513 --> 03:42:42.248
HAVE DONE BETTER DURING THE

03:42:42.315 --> 03:42:44.918
PANDEMIC I THINK OF FLORIDA I

03:42:44.984 --> 03:42:46.453
THINK OF WHAT WE SAW IN THE

03:42:46.519 --> 03:42:48.688
NEWS IN TERMS OF COLLEGE KIDS

03:42:48.755 --> 03:42:50.724
OR GENERAL POPULATION NOT

03:42:50.790 --> 03:42:53.259
WEARING MASKS NOT BELIEVING IN

03:42:53.326 --> 03:42:54.728
THE VACCINE. COMING TO

03:42:54.794 --> 03:42:56.730
CALIFORNIA AND ACTUALLY

03:42:56.796 --> 03:42:58.465
NEGATIVELY IMPACTING ALL OF THE

03:42:58.531 --> 03:43:00.266
GOOD WORK THAT WE HAVE DONE. SO

03:43:00.333 --> 03:43:02.702
I'M I'M JUST VERY PRECAUTIONS

03:43:02.769 --> 03:43:04.003
ABOUT WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE

03:43:04.070 --> 03:43:05.972
BECAUSE WE ARE NOT FULLY. IN A

03:43:06.039 --> 03:43:09.909
STATE OF- 1100% OR CLOSE TO.

03:43:09.976 --> 03:43:11.544
THE TOP OF A HERD IMMUNITY

03:43:11.611 --> 03:43:13.947
ACROSS THE NATION AND SO. I

03:43:14.013 --> 03:43:15.415
JUST I WANT US TO THINK ABOUT

03:43:15.482 --> 03:43:17.217
THAT BECAUSE THE HEALTH OF OUR

03:43:17.283 --> 03:43:18.785
STATE AND THE PEOPLE THAT LIVE

03:43:18.852 --> 03:43:21.554
HERE SHOULD BE. AT THE PRIORITY

03:43:21.621 --> 03:43:24.124

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT

CONSUMERS BELIEVE AND WHY I

03:43:38.838 --> 03:43:40.907
THINK WE DID IN TERMS OF THE

03:43:40.974 --> 03:43:43.009
RIGHT THING AND OUR UNIQUE

03:43:43.076 --> 03:43:44.778
APPROACH TO THIS. AS A MATTER

03:43:44.844 --> 03:43:47.180

SOME OF OUR IN STATE MEDIA

03:43:50.250 --> 03:43:52.218
THAT'S RUNNING. IS A

03:43:52.285 --> 03:43:54.521
RESPONSIBLE TRAVEL CODE. ASK

IS FRANKLY A BEST IN CLASS WITH

03:44:04.731 --> 03:44:06.332
THE NATION THAT OUR LOCAL

03:44:06.399 --> 03:44:08.802
DESTINATIONS ARE REPLICATING

03:44:08.868 --> 03:44:11.004
AND ACTUALLY HAVE SOME SYNERGY

03:44:11.070 --> 03:44:13.473
WITH SO. ARE YOU SUPPORT BACK

LITTLE BIT OF A DIFFERENT ISSUE

03:44:18.178 --> 03:44:20.146
HOW DO THEN WE CLOSE THE GAP

03:44:20.213 --> 03:44:22.182
WITH THE CONSUMERS I DO NOT

03:44:22.248 --> 03:44:23.883

MAKE OUT GROUND BECAUSE- WE

03:44:39.499 --> 03:44:41.601
ACTUALLY ARE LOOKING AT AT A

03:44:41.668 --> 03:44:43.903
TIME LINE FOR TOTAL RECOVERY.

03:44:43.970 --> 03:44:46.506
THAT TAKES US THROUGH TWENTY

03:44:46.573 --> 03:44:47.307
TWENTY FOUR AND WOULD COST THE

03:44:47.373 --> 03:44:49.008
STATE SEVENTY SIX BILLION

03:44:49.075 --> 03:44:51.344

HOSPITALITY AND WHAT THAT LOOKS

03:45:14.167 --> 03:45:15.702
LIKE AN ENSURING THAT. WE

03:45:15.768 --> 03:45:17.337

04:28:00.497 --> 04:28:01.532
VACANCIES OUT OF HOW MANY

04:28:01.598 --> 04:28:03.734
EUROPE WAS TO OFFER I STAFF

GREAT IN THE BACKGROUND PROCESS

04:28:18.182 --> 04:28:19.516
BUT I MEAN YOU'RE BASICALLY

04:28:19.583 --> 04:28:22.052
RUNNING AT HALF STRENGTH IN HOW

04:28:22.119 --> 04:28:25.689
LONG HAS IT BEEN THAT WAY FOR.

04:28:25.756 --> 04:28:26.990
WHAT I WOULD HAVE TO TAKE A

04:28:27.057 --> 04:28:28.292
LOOK I WASN'T IN THIS POSITION

04:28:28.358 --> 04:28:30.160
TO BE SAFELY I'D HAVE TO. TAKE

04:28:30.227 --> 04:28:31.829
GO BACK HISTORICALLY LOOK AT

04:28:31.895 --> 04:28:33.030
SOME OF THOSE NUMBERS. THE

04:28:33.096 --> 04:28:34.331
PROBLEM WITH THE STATE IS NO

04:28:34.398 --> 04:28:36.400
MATTER WHERE YOU ARE- THAT'S

04:28:36.467 --> 04:28:37.201
LEVELS THE LOCAL LAW

04:28:37.267 --> 04:28:38.469
ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES BECAUSE

04:28:38.535 --> 04:28:40.604
THE STATE THE PAY IS. IS NOT

04:28:40.671 --> 04:28:42.339
VERY GOOD AND IT'S ALL OVER

04:28:42.406 --> 04:28:43.006
DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU ARE

04:28:43.073 --> 04:28:44.875
WHETHER YOU'RE AT. A CANNABIS

04:28:44.942 --> 04:28:46.410
OR YOUR CONSUMER AFFAIRS OR

04:28:46.477 --> 04:28:48.245
REAL ESTATE- YOU THINK

04:28:48.312 --> 04:28:49.947
INVESTIGATORS INVESTIGATOR FOR

04:28:50.013 --> 04:28:52.015
THE STATE BUT THE STATE IS. SO

04:28:52.082 --> 04:28:53.750
DYSFUNCTIONAL WE HAVE DIFFERENT

04:28:53.817 --> 04:28:54.518
PAY SCALES ARE DIFFERENT

04:28:54.585 --> 04:28:56.753
BARRING AGREEMENTS SO MAKES IT

04:28:56.820 --> 04:28:57.654
HARD TO RECRUIT INDIVIDUALS

04:28:57.721 --> 04:29:00.057
WITH THIS. BECAUSE THE PAY IS

04:29:00.123 --> 04:29:02.326
LOCAL PROCEDURE OF MUSICALITY

04:29:02.392 --> 04:29:04.094
IS. THAT PAY MUCH BETTER SO

04:29:04.161 --> 04:29:05.929
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN AN ISSUE THINK

04:29:05.996 --> 04:29:07.564
ON THIS SUBCOMMITTEE. OVER THE

04:29:07.631 --> 04:29:09.366

04:29:29.820 --> 04:29:30.888
DO THAT THE PEACE OFFICERS WERE

04:29:30.954 --> 04:29:32.256

DISCUSSION EARLIER. THE FEDERAL

04:45:02.051 --> 04:45:03.219
GOVERNMENT IN AUTHORIZING THIS

04:45:03.286 --> 04:45:04.487
FUNDS PUT THE TREASURY

04:45:04.554 --> 04:45:05.688

04:45:20.336 --> 04:45:22.104
