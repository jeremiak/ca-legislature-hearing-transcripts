WE ALL REMEMBER THE PAINFUL PAST IN THE EIGHTIES THE HIV AIDS EPIDEMIC TO THIS NATION BY STORM. CUTTING FAR TOO MANY LIVE SHORT. AND LEAVING A VOID IN THE HEARTS OF THOSE LEFT BEHIND. IT WAS THE LGBT COMMUNITY THAT SUFFERED THE BRUNT OF THESE LOSSES. PARTICULARLY AFRICAN AMERICANS WITHIN THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY. HOWEVER SINCE THE IN THESE COMMUNITIES HAVE CONTINUED TO WORK TIRELESSLY TO RECOVER FROM THE PAIN AND THE BIAS OF THAT ERA. BUT PROGRESS QUITE FRANKLY COLLEAGUES HAS BEEN UNEVEN. IN MORE RECENT YEARS HIV DIAGNOSES AMONG BLACK WOMEN HAVE DECLINED AND AMONG BLACK CAMERA SEXUAL MAN AS WELL. HOWEVER THEY WERE FAR TOO MANY YEARS WITH THOSE COMMUNITIES WERE NOT RECOGNIZE AND TREATMENT DOLLARS NOT DIRECTED TOWARD THEIR UNIQUE NEEDS. HOWEVER AMONG BLACK GAY AND BISEXUAL MEN HIV DIAGNOSES HAVE DECLINED MUCH AT A MUCH SLOWER RATE. DUE TO SYSTEMIC MARGINALIZATION. BLACK COMMUNITIES CONTINUE TO LACK THE RESOURCES AN OUT REACH TO HELP IN THE FIGHT AGAINST HIV. SIMILARLY STIGMA TATIAN STIGMATIZATION ASSOCIATED THE ILLNESS OFTEN PRESENTS MEMBERS OF THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY FROM ACCESSING CRITICAL PROTECTIONS AND TREATMENTS AGAINST HIV. TO NOT ONLY KNOWLEDGE THE DISPARATE IMPACT HIV HAS HAD ON BLACK AND LGBT COMMUNITIES. BUT ALSO BEGIN TO ENGAGE IN MEASURES THAT ACTIVELY COMBAT THESE BURDENS. INSURING THAT HIV AIDS NO LONGER TAKES THE LIVES OF VALUABLE MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITIES. AND YOU'LL HEAR FROM MY COLLEAGUE BUT I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR MITCHELL SENATOR WIENER. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AND I RISE SAYS HERE THE THE LGBT CAUCUS -- IN SUPPORT AND PARTNERSHIP ON THIS RESOLUTION -- WE'VE BEEN WORKING VERY HARD FOR MANY YEARS -- TO TRY TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF NEW AND AND TO TRY TO MAKE SURE -- THAT EVERYONE WHO'S LIVING WITH HIV HAS ACCESS -- TO TREATMENT HEALTH CARE OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO LIVE HEALTHY LONG PRODUCTIVE LIVES -- WE MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS -- REDUCING INFECTIONS -- AND GETTING PEOPLE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE BUT UNFORTUNATELY -- DOC PROGRESS HAS NOT BEEN EQUITABLE -- AND HAS NOT REACHED ALL MEMBERS OF COMMUNITY OF OUR COMMUNITY -- AND PARTICULAR -- THE AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY -- HAS EXPERIENCE HIGHER RATES OF INFECTION -- HIGHER RATES OF LACK OF ACCESS. TO HEALTH CARE -- AND THESE DISPARITIES. WE NEED TO REACH TO ENSURING THAT EYES WE ENHANCE OUR APPROACHES TO PREVENTION THROUGH CRAP AND OTHER POWERFUL PREVENTION TOOLS -- AS WE IT MAKE MORE MORE PROGRESS IN -- IN SUPPRESSING PEOPLE'S VIRAL LOADS AND HELPING PEOPLE LIVE.

MITCHELL FOR BRINGING AWARENESS IS IMPORTANT ISSUE. THE HEALTH DISPARITIES ARE GLARING AS WE'VE HEARD OUR CLICK DISADVANTAGE EXPERIENCE POOR HEALTH CARE ACCESS IN A LOWER QUALITY OF CARE. AT THE LEGISLATIVE BODY WE SHOULD WE NEED TO MAKE THE BROUGHT COMMITMENT TO ELIMINATING THE DISPARITIES THAT EXIST. THE UNITED STATES HEALTH CARE TODAY OR FIRST WE MUST ALL RECOGNIZE THAT THESE DISPARITIES EXIST AND AGREE THAT IT'S UNACCEPTABLE FOR ANYONE TO EXPERIENCE.
