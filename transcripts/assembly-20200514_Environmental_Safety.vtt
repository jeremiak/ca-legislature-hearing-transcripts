01:06:33.589 --> 01:06:35.858
JURISDICTIONS ARE. TO CHARGE A

01:06:35.925 --> 01:06:37.326
REASONABLE ENOUGH FEED TO COVER

01:06:37.393 --> 01:06:38.928
THEIR COSTS THE FEDERAL AND

01:06:38.994 --> 01:06:41.230
STATE REQUIREMENTS. UNDER THS

01:06:41.297 --> 01:06:43.833
BILL. LOCAL JURISDICTIONAL

01:06:43.899 --> 01:06:47.269
ELECT. TO ARE THE CHARGE THEIR

01:06:47.336 --> 01:06:50.306
OWN FEE AS THEY DO NOW. ALL

01:06:50.373 --> 01:06:54.643
THEY WILL IF THE STATE ARCH THE

01:06:54.710 --> 01:06:56.912
FEET. A SINGLE STATEWIDE THAT

01:06:56.979 --> 01:06:59.782
THE- CHARGES ACROSS THE BOARD.

01:06:59.849 --> 01:07:03.018
AND THEY WILL. BASICALLY BE

01:07:03.085 --> 01:07:06.188
PAID BY THE STATE TO DO THE

01:07:06.255 --> 01:07:08.391
WORK THAT THEY HAVE TO DO. SO

01:07:08.457 --> 01:07:11.594
IT'S A WIN WIN FOR THE LOCAL.

01:07:11.660 --> 01:07:13.562
BECAUSE THEY HAVE AN OPTION OF

01:07:13.629 --> 01:07:15.998
EITHER HAVING THE STATE. IMPOSE

01:07:16.065 --> 01:07:18.601
THE STATE WIDE B. AND HAVE THE

01:07:18.667 --> 01:07:21.170
LOCALS PAID BY THE STATE PUT

01:07:21.237 --> 01:07:23.839
DOING THE WORK FOR. THAT DAY

01:07:23.906 --> 01:07:26.208
CAN KEEP THE STATUS QUO AND

01:07:26.275 --> 01:07:27.877
IT'S A WIN FOR THE STATE

01:07:27.943 --> 01:07:29.612
BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE TO GEAR

01:07:29.678 --> 01:07:30.946
UP AND TAKE OVER THOSE LOCAL

01:07:31.013 --> 01:07:34.283
PROGRAMS THAT ARE NOT ABLE TO

01:07:34.350 --> 01:07:37.219
PROVIDE THIS SERVICE WITH THE

01:07:37.286 --> 01:07:39.955
FEES THAT THEY ARE CURRENTLY

01:07:40.022 --> 01:07:41.457
CHARGING. SO WE SEE IS A WIN

01:07:41.524 --> 01:07:43.826
WIN AS AN OPTIONAL PROGRAM. IT

01:07:43.893 --> 01:07:45.895
ENHANCES AND RETAINS LOCAL

01:07:45.961 --> 01:07:49.732
CONTROL. BUT IT ALSO KEEPS THE-

01:07:49.799 --> 01:07:51.867
DELEGATION PROCESS FROM THE

01:07:51.934 --> 01:07:53.969
STATE WHICH IS SHOWS THAT A

01:07:54.036 --> 01:07:55.871
LOCAL JURISDICTION THAT WISHES

01:07:55.938 --> 01:07:58.474
TO BE AN LP A- STILL NEEDS THE

01:07:58.541 --> 01:08:00.142
NECESSARY REQUIREMENTS. THAT IS

01:08:00.209 --> 01:08:03.446
THAT ARE CAPABLE OF PERFORMING

01:08:03.512 --> 01:08:05.581
WHAT IT NEEDS TO PERFORM. RIGHT

01:08:05.648 --> 01:08:06.782
I LET ME LET ME ASK THE SAME

01:08:06.849 --> 01:08:08.217
QUESTION A DIFFERENT WAY I

01:08:08.284 --> 01:08:09.752
UNDERSTAND WHAT THE PURPOSE OF

01:08:09.819 --> 01:08:12.021
THE BILL IS AND THE MECHANICS-

01:08:12.087 --> 01:08:14.290
THAT ARE GOING INTO IT BUT MY

01:08:14.356 --> 01:08:16.225
QUESTION IS IF WE ARE TRYING TO

01:08:16.292 --> 01:08:19.328
STEER. MORE FUNDING TO. LOCAL

01:08:19.395 --> 01:08:20.863
PRIMACY AGENCY WHERE DOES THAT

01:08:20.930 --> 01:08:24.800
MONEY COME FROM. MONEY WILL

01:08:24.867 --> 01:08:26.902
COME FROM THE BOARD OF POTS OF

01:08:26.969 --> 01:08:28.804
MONEY THAT THE STATE WATER

01:08:28.871 --> 01:08:31.774
RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD HAS.

01:08:31.841 --> 01:08:34.443
AND THE THAT'S WHY INITIALLY

01:08:34.510 --> 01:08:36.612
THE WATER AGENCIES WERE

01:08:36.679 --> 01:08:41.083
CONCERNED. BECAUSE THE BILL

01:08:41.150 --> 01:08:43.052
WOULD COME FROM THE DRINKING

01:08:43.118 --> 01:08:44.720
WATERACCOUNT AT THE STATE

01:08:44.787 --> 01:08:47.223
WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD.

01:08:47.289 --> 01:08:48.557
CURRENTLY MANAGES AND

01:08:48.624 --> 01:08:51.994
ADMINISTERS. AT ANY ADDITIONAL

01:08:52.061 --> 01:08:54.296
COST WOULD HAVE TO COME FROM

01:08:54.363 --> 01:08:57.500
THAT FOLDER ACCOUNT. AND MY

01:08:57.566 --> 01:09:00.336
EARLY- WHAT'S THAT THIS BILL IN

01:09:00.402 --> 01:09:03.873
OF ITSELF ISN'T. CAUSING AN

01:09:03.939 --> 01:09:07.409
INCREASE IN ANY OF THE FEES OR

01:09:07.476 --> 01:09:09.111
ANY OF THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT

01:09:09.178 --> 01:09:11.647
HAS TO BE PAID TO GET THIS JOB

01:09:11.714 --> 01:09:15.217
DONE BECAUSE THE LOCALS. CAN

01:09:15.284 --> 01:09:17.419
ACTUALLY DO THE WORK LESS THAN

01:09:17.486 --> 01:09:19.922
THE STATE. SO IF THE STATE WERE

01:09:19.989 --> 01:09:22.124
TO TAKE OVER THOSE CITY EL PA

01:09:22.191 --> 01:09:24.827
PROGRAMS. THEY WILL HAVE TO

01:09:24.894 --> 01:09:27.830
CHARGE THE SAME OR LACKEY MORE

01:09:27.897 --> 01:09:31.233
MONEY. FOR THE STATE TO DO THE

01:09:31.300 --> 01:09:32.735
WORK THAT THE LOCALS ARE DOING.

01:09:32.801 --> 01:09:34.503
SO THAT'S THE REASON THE LOCAL

01:09:34.570 --> 01:09:38.541
THE WATER AGENCIES ARE NOT

01:09:38.607 --> 01:09:39.942
NEUTRAL ON THE BILL. AT THE

01:09:40.009 --> 01:09:42.878
STATE THE BENEFIT. NXT SAID

01:09:42.945 --> 01:09:45.214
SHE'S. BUT BUT AT LEAST GETTING

01:09:45.281 --> 01:09:47.182
THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THE

01:09:47.249 --> 01:09:48.951
CAPACITY TO CONTINUE THAT

01:09:49.018 --> 01:09:51.854
PROGRAM. OKAY I UNDERSTAND

01:09:51.921 --> 01:09:54.089
THANK YOU FOR THE RESPONSE- I

01:09:54.156 --> 01:09:57.526
STILL HAVE A CONCERN HERE THAT-

01:09:57.593 --> 01:10:00.195
BECAUSE THERE ISN'T ENOUGH

01:10:00.262 --> 01:10:01.130
MONEY COMING OUT IN FEES TO

01:10:01.196 --> 01:10:03.465
FUND. A CERTAIN LOCAL PRIVACY

01:10:03.532 --> 01:10:04.733
AGENCY THAT PRIVACY AGENT

01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:05.935
AGENCY WOULD DELEGATE ITS

01:10:06.001 --> 01:10:07.770
AUTHORITY TO THE STATE WATER

01:10:07.836 --> 01:10:10.272
BOARD GAME WE DECKED AXIS

01:10:10.339 --> 01:10:11.941
THEREBY TO A BROADER POOL OF

01:10:12.007 --> 01:10:13.175
FUNDS BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND

01:10:13.242 --> 01:10:15.144
WHERE THOSE FUNDS ARE COMING

01:10:15.210 --> 01:10:17.546
FROM AND MY FEAR IS THAT- THE

01:10:17.613 --> 01:10:19.381
STATE WATER BOARD LED TO

01:10:19.448 --> 01:10:20.883
INCREASE FEES ON OTHER PARTS.

01:10:20.950 --> 01:10:23.485
STATE WOULD LEAD LEAD TO FIVE

01:10:23.552 --> 01:10:25.120
TWO USERS PAYING INTO A FUND

01:10:25.187 --> 01:10:26.722
THAT DIDN'T GET A DIRECT

01:10:26.789 --> 01:10:28.424
BENEFIT FROM SO THAT'S MY

01:10:28.490 --> 01:10:30.559
CONCERN I'M I'M OKAY ACOSTA-

01:10:30.626 --> 01:10:31.860
I'D LIKE TO SUPPORT THE BILL

01:10:31.927 --> 01:10:33.862

JUST BECAUSE I'D LIKE TO GET AN

01:10:34.563 --> 01:10:38.567

01:32:06.354 --> 01:32:08.155
DISPUTED ACTIVE HARM TO HUMAN

01:32:08.222 --> 01:32:09.757

01:32:12.126 --> 01:32:14.495
BY THIS BILL AND PAN OF THE

01:32:14.562 --> 01:32:16.130
CHEMICALS ARE DIRECTLY LINKED

01:32:16.197 --> 01:32:19.200
TO BREAST CANCER AND NINE ARE

01:32:19.267 --> 01:32:19.800
LINKED TO A COMPROMISED IMMUNE

01:32:19.867 --> 01:32:22.904
SYSTEM. WHICH OF COURSE CAN-

01:32:22.970 --> 01:32:25.840
I'LL BE FINISHED ABOUT BUILDING.

01:32:25.907 --> 01:32:28.109
AND THE RECOVERY FROM COLBERT

01:32:28.175 --> 01:32:29.944
NINETEEN ALL OF THESE BILLS ARE

01:32:30.011 --> 01:32:32.680
CURRENTLY BANNED FROM COSMETIC

01:32:33.347 --> 01:32:36.584
UNION. SHALL DESPITE CLAIMS

01:32:36.651 --> 01:32:37.852
THAT A LITTLE BIT OF A TOXIC

01:32:37.919 --> 01:32:39.553
CHEMICAL IN A CONSUMER PRODUCT

01:32:39.620 --> 01:32:41.489
ID ACOSTA CONCERN THE EVIDENCE

01:32:41.555 --> 01:32:44.692
SHOWS THAT EVEN SMALL EXPOSURES

01:32:44.759 --> 01:32:46.694
CAN CAUSE HARM. HOPING FETUSES

01:32:46.761 --> 01:32:49.297
INFANTS AND CHILDREN. AND NONE

01:32:49.363 --> 01:32:50.631
OF US LIVE IN A BUBBLE WE ARE

01:32:50.698 --> 01:32:52.833
EXPOSED TO TOXIC CHEMICALS DALY

01:32:52.900 --> 01:32:54.502
AND HUMAN LOVE THE CUMULATIVE

01:32:54.568 --> 01:32:56.871
EXPOSURES INCREASE THE RISK OF

01:32:56.938 --> 01:32:59.540
HARM. SO EVIDENCE IS EMERGING

01:32:59.607 --> 01:33:01.175
THAT PEOPLE MOST AFFECTED BY

01:33:01.242 --> 01:33:03.177
TOXIC CHEMICAL EXPOSURES ARE

01:33:03.244 --> 01:33:05.579
MORE VULNERABLE TO CALL THE

01:33:05.646 --> 01:33:07.581
NINETEEN IN PERFECT ABILITY AND

01:33:07.648 --> 01:33:10.751
IN RECOVERY IMPORTANTLY NINE OF

01:33:10.818 --> 01:33:11.686
THE TWELVE CHEMICALS BANNED BY

01:33:11.752 --> 01:33:12.920
THE CELLS ARE LINKED TO

01:33:12.987 --> 01:33:14.255
DISRUPTION IN IMMUNE SYSTEM

01:33:14.322 --> 01:33:16.390
FUNCTION. WHICH CAN RESULT IN

01:33:16.457 --> 01:33:18.159

PROPER FUNCTIONING OF THE

01:33:21.162 --> 01:33:23.698
IMMUNE SYSTEM. SO I JUST WANT

01:33:23.764 --> 01:33:25.766
TO SAY A LITTLE BIT OF WHAT WE

01:33:25.833 --> 01:33:26.634
KNOW ABOUT SOMEBODY'S TOXIC

01:33:26.701 --> 01:33:28.970
CHEMICALS- DEBTOR THAT THIS

01:33:29.036 --> 01:33:31.605

01:33:31.672 --> 01:33:33.174
THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE P.
