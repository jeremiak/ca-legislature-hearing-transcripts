TODAY WITH OUR- HEARING WITH THE ASSEMBLY BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE ON EDUCATION FINANCE TODAY IS OUR HIGHER EDUCATION DAY TO TALK ABOUT- THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISE PROPOSALS IT'S- AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO HEAR FROM THE PARTMINER FINANCE BUT REALLY- TALK ABOUT WHAT OUR ASSEMBLY PRIORITIES ARE FOR HIGHER ED. AND JUST AN OVERALL THERE'S NOT MUCH OF A HEARING TODAY WITH THE- THE ADMINISTRATION BECAUSE THERE'S NOT MUCH IN HERE ON GOING FOR HIGHER AT- IT IS WHAT IT IS IF YOU LOOK AT THE L. A- CHARTS THEY HAVE ALL THE ON GOING MONEY- YOU CAN'T SEE THIS BUT YOU CAN SEE THE SMALLEST LITTLE BLIP HERE. IS FOR HIGHER AT ON GOING AND SO THAT IS A PROBLEM WE'RE GOING TO ADDRESS THIS MORNING- WE OVERALL I THINK THE LEGISLATURE THE GOVERNOR HAD THE SAME HIGHER READ GOALS FOCUSING ON ACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY. WE HEAR LOUD AND CLEAR OF COURSE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE FOCUS ON ACCOUNTABILITY WITH- WITH OUR SYSTEMS WAS WELL AS WHAT THEY CAN DO FOR OUR WORK FORCE IN OUR REGIONAL ECONOMIES. BUT OVERALL- WE ARE DISAPPOINTED THAT THIS HISTORIC BUDGET SURPLUS FOR THE SECOND YEAR DOESN'T TAKE ADVANTAGE OF INVESTING IN HIGHER ED. OF THE- FIFTY TWO BILLION DOLLAR SURPLUS GENERAL FUND THE ELLIOTT NOTES VERY LITTLE FOR HIGHER ED OUR PRIORITIES AREN'T THAT COMPLICATED WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS YEAR AND FRANKLY FOR THE PRIOR YEARS- MAJOR PRIORITIES ARE EXPANDING FINANCIAL AID. MR MEDINA AND I'VE BEEN WORKING ON- YOU KNOW THE GOVERNOR AND THE PERMANENT FINANCE TALK ABOUT A PATH IN THE GOAL TO HAVE DEBT FREE COLLEGE IN CALIFORNIA. AND WE CERTAINLY KNOW THAT TOO MANY STUDENTS ARE OVER BURDENED WITH- IT WITH DATA CENTER CAL GRANT PROGRAM IS OVERLY COMPLICATED- YOU NEED IT SOMETIMES A MASTER'S DEGREE TO FILL OUT THE APPLICATION- LEAVE WE LEAVE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF LOW INCOME CALIFORNIA STUDENTS. OUT AND WE DON'T ADDRESS THE TOTAL COST OF ATTENDANCE AND SO THAT. IS SOMETHING THAT WE STARTED TO DO LAST YEAR WERE PROUD LAST YEAR WE GOT. A MAJOR STEP OF THE WAY- AND I KNOW WE TALKED TO THE GOVERNOR ABOUT THIS LAST YEAR AND HE THAT DIRECTION WAS TO COME BACK IN THE BUDGET DON'T DO THEIR LEGISLATION AND THAT'S WHAT WE- ATTEMPT TO DO IT WE WILL DO THAT AND OUR VERSION. AND LOW DISAPPOINTING WE DON'T SEE ON GOING MONEY HERE FOR- EXPANDING FINANCIAL AID THERE IS SOME MONEY BUT ESSENTIALLY THAT PAYS FOR LAST YEAR'S DEAL SO. HAS KIND DOUBLE COUNTING- WE KNOW THAT WE HEAR FROM ALL OF OUR MEMBERS- THE MOST THE THING WE HEARD FROM OUR MEMBERS AT HOME. IS THE FACT THAT THERE'S TOO MANY QUALIFIED STUDENTS WHO APPLY. TO UC AND CSU WHO GET DENIED. TO MANY UC CAMPUSES ONLY IN THAT ABOUT 10230% OF THEIR CALIFORNIA APPLICANTS- WE HAVE DONE A BETTER JOB. OF FOCUSING ON MORE CALIFORNIANS AS OPPOSED TO THE EVER INCREASING NUMBER OF NON RESIDENTS- BUT WE CAN'T DO BETTER IN SUPPORT ROLE MEANT WE KNOW THEY CAN THAT THEY CONTACT THE GOVERNOR ALLOWED. HAS A 1% GROWTH BUT THAT. THAT REALLY ISN'T ENOUGH TO MEET THE DEMAND FOR CALIFORNIANS APPLYING TO UC- AS WELL AS WE KNOW OUR LOCAL EMPLOYERS AND STATEWIDE EMPLOYERS ARE SAYING ANY MORE COLLEGE GRADUATES. AND THEN DON'T SEE ADDRESSED HERE THAT IS ONE OF OUR TOP PRIORITIES. PLEASE STUDENT HOUSING YOU KNOW ALL THROUGH THE HEADLINES IN THIS FALL I'M SORRY THE SPRING. WE HEARD ABOUT UC BERKELEY. AND SEQUEL AT NIMBYISM AND SEND THAT UNDERLYING ISSUE THE- WAS OR WASN'T ENOUGH HOUSING FOR STUDENTS- TO LIVE AND SO WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE A HOUSING CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE A STUDENT DEBT CRISIS AND AFFORDABILITY CRISIS IN COLLEGE AND SO PUT THOSE TWO TOGETHER. BUT WE NEED MORE STUDENT HOUSING- SO. WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY WE THINK WITH THIS- SURPLUS- AND AGAIN THIS ONE IS HEAD SCRATCHING TOO BECAUSE ONE OF THINGS FINANCE AS WE DON'T WANT TO SPEND. ON GOING GENERAL FINAL FINANCE PRAISED ON. THAT 99% THE MONEY THE SURPLUS WAS SPENT ON ONE TIME NOT ON GOING. AND THIS HOUSING OF COURSE IS A ONE TIME. EXPENDITURE AND WE DON'T SEE ANY OF THAT SO THIS WILL BE. ON OUR PRIORITY LIST WHEN WE ADOPT OUR- ASSEMBLY PLANNED SO WE WANT TO BRIEFLY GO THROUGH THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS THEY SHOULD BE BRIEF BECAUSE THERE REALLY AREN'T VERY MANY. AND THEN WE'LL FOCUS ON SOME OF OUR PRIORITIES FROM THE LEGISLATURE. SO WITH THAT WE'RE GOING TO START WITH- THE- WE'RE GONNA HAVE AT ONE OF OUR COLLEAGUE YES COME AND JOIN US TO TALK ABOUT SOME YOU SEE ISSUES SO WE'RE GONNA. WAITED A BIT ON UC. AND WILL START NOW. WITH OUR- CSU NAY REVISED PROPOSALS. THE TIMING. ONE OKAY. OKAY GOOD MORNING WE'LL START AND YET THIS MORNING I COLLEGES ARE INFORMATIONAL ITEMS- THESE AREN'T VOTING ITEMS AND WE PROBABLY WON'T DO THAT THE VOTING ON THE NON CONTROVERSIAL STUFF EITHER TODAY'S WELL. SO LET'S START ON DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE YES YOU MAY REVISED POLLS. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS GENEROUSLY WITH HE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ME REVISION MAINTAINS THE FIRE THEFT BASE INCREASE OF TWO HUNDRED ELEVEN POINT ONE MILLION GENERAL FUND AND OTHER INVESTMENTS INTRODUCED BY THE REGION IN JANUARY AS PART OF A MULTI YEAR CONTRACT WITH THE CAL STATE UNIVERSITY. IN THE REVISION PROVIDING TOLD OF A HUNDRED SEVENTY FOUR MILLION ONE TIME JOURNAL FINE TO THE CSU SYSTEM THESE INVESTMENTS SAID THE FOLLOWING EIGHTY MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND TO EXPAND THE SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY POINT FIVE MILLION ONE TIME TRYING TO FIND. THIS USED TO FOR ENGINE AGAIN SCIENCE INNOVATION HUB. AN ADDITIONAL TWENTY FIVE MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND TO SUPPORT EQUIPMENT AND FACILITIES FOR CSU UNIVERSITY FARMS FOR COMBINED INVESTMENT OF SEVENTY FIVE MILLION FOR THIS PURPOSE WITH THE AUGMENTED. ONE POINT FIVE MILLION ONE TIME TRYING TO FIND TO SUPPORT A FIRST ARE FAR STREET CO CORK I BOTH CSU NORTHRIDGE AND CSU EAST BAY. LAST WEEK THE MAY REVISION ALSO PROVIDES THAT FINDS FOR UNIVERSITY FARM CSU FULLERTON AND SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY AND GOVERNOR'S BUDGET OF EIGHTY THREE ONE MILLION. ONE TIME GENERAL FUND FOR THE CSU BAKERSFIELD ENERGY INNOVATION CENTRE. ARE EXEMPT FROM EDUCATION CODE SECTION EIGHTY NINE SEVEN SEVEN THREE AS TO NOT EXCEED THE CAP ON THE PERCENTAGE OF THE CSU'S GENERAL FUND STATE OPERATION PROCREATION. THAT CAN BE EXPANDED TO PAY AS YOU GO CAPITAL OUTLAY PROJECT. WITHOUT I SHALL CONCLUDE MY PRESENTATION I WOULD BE HAPPY TO GO INTO FURTHER DETAILS REQUEST OR REQUEST OR ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU L. A. L. GOOD MORNING CAN MEMBERS THE THINKING WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. HE SHOULD HAVE BEFORE YOU A HANDOUT SUMMARIZING THE HIGHER EDUCATION THE REVISION PROPOSALS. IF YOU TURN TO PAGE TWO OF THAT HAND OUT OF FEAR TABLE THAT SUMMARIZES THE NEAR VISION PROPOSALS FOR CSU. IT SHOWS THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSALS IN THE FIRST COLUMN THE MAYOR VISION FALLS IN THE SECOND COLUMN IN THE DIFFERENCE IN THAT. RIGHT MOST COLUMN. THE LARGEST PROPOSALS FOR SEE IF YOU IN THE MEROVINGIAN ARE FOR SPECIFIC CAPITAL OUTLAY PROJECTS AS MY COLLEAGUE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IT DESCRIBES. HE'S LISTED IN THE BOTTOM HALF OF THE TABLE AND A ONE TIME INITIATIVES CAPITAL OUTLAY CAN BE BENEFICIAL RIGHT NOW. BOTH IN ADDRESSING THE ISSUES INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS. AND IN ADDRESSING THE STATE'S BUDGETARY REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE STATE APPROPRIATIONS LIMIT. AND LATER I TO MY COLLEAGUE JASON CONCENTRATES WILL PROVIDE FURTHER DETAIL ON THAT. NONE THE LESS WE DO HAVE A FEW CONCERNS WITH THE SPECIFIC CAPITAL OUTLAY PROJECTS THAT THE GOVERNOR SELECTED. FIRST OVER THE YEARS THE SUB COMMITTEE HAS DISCUSSED MANY COUPLE OUTLAY PRIORITIES FOR THE UNIVERSITIES. RANGING FROM ADDRESSING DEFERRED MAINTENANCE TO EXPANDING ENROLLMENT CAPACITY HIGH DEMAND CAMPUSES. SOME OF THE GOVERNOR'S NEAR VISION CAPITAL OUTLAY PROPOSALS FOR CSU DON'T CLEARLY ALIGNED WITH THESE PRIORITIES AND ARGUE THE ADMINISTRATION HASN'T PROVIDED A STRONG RATIONALE FOR SELECTING THESE PARTICULAR PROJECTS OVER OTHER PROJECTS THAT. ALIGN WITH THOSE PRIORITIES. SECOND SOME OF THE PROPOSED PROJECTS ALSO WERE NOT IN CSU'S MULTI YEAR CAPITAL OUTLAY PLAN. SUGGESTING THE COMPREHENSIVE PLANNING MAY NOT HAVE YET OCCURRED ON THESE PROJECTS. WE THINK THIS IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT FOR THE PROJECT AT SAN DIEGO STATE'S FRAWLEY CENTER AS THE GOVERNOR'S. GOALS FOR THIS CENTER ARE- REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT EXPANSION FROM THE CENTERS KERN OPERATIONS. ULTIMATELY WITH ANY OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED CAPITAL OUTLAY PROJECTS FOR CSU THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER REDIRECTING THESE FUNDS TO OTHER CAPITAL PURPOSES. SUCH AS ADDRESSING THE ISSUES DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BACKLOG OR ADDRESSING OTHER CAPITAL PRIORITIES THE LEGISLATURE HAS. THANK YOU HAVE A TAKEN QUESTIONS THE CSU. GOOD MORNING AT CHAIR MCCARTY AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS RYAN STORM I AM THE ASSISTANT VICE CHANCELLOR FOR BUDGET FOR THE CSU OFFICE OF THE CHANCELLOR. TUCKER THREE TOPIC AREAS TODAY THE FIRST IS OUR RESPONSE TO THE MAY REVISION THE SECOND IS THE MULTI YEAR COMPACT IN THE THIRD COMMENTS ON WHAT MUST STILL BE ACCOMPLISHED ON THE CSU BUDGET. SO MY FIRST TOPIC THE MAY REVISION PROPOSALS PROJECTS AT THE UNIVERSITY FARMS AT FULLER TEN IN THE IPERIAL VALLEY ARE IMPORTANT TO THOSE CSU CAMPUSES AND ALL OF THOSE PROJECTS WOULD ADD TREMENDOUS VALUE TO THE CAMPUSES. NOW THE ASSEMBLY MAY AGREE WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND FUND THOSE. INVERSELY IF THE ASSEMBLY. THE ASSEMBLY MAY CHOOSE NOT TO FUND THEM. IF THAT HAPPENS IN THE L. A. AS RECOMMENDATION TO REDIRECT THOSE ONE TIME FUNDS TO THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES ONE BILLION DOLLAR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE REQUEST WOULD BE A REASONABLE ALTERNATIVE FOR US. WE SHARE THE CONCERN RAISED BY THE LA- ON THE ONE TIME FOSTER YOUTH PROPOSAL FOR THE EAST BAY AND NORTHRIDGE CAMPUSES. IN PARTICULAR THE ONE TIME THE NATURE OF THIS PROPOSAL WOULD CREATE ONGOING COST PRESSURES TO SUSTAIN THOSE PROGRAMS. AFTER THE FUNDS EXPIRE. ALSO THE PROGRAM IS NOT A PRIORITY OF EITHER CAMPUS TODAY. NOW MY SECOND TOPIC COMMENTS ON THE CHANGES TO THE MULTI YOUR CONTACT. NO CONTACT IS AN IMPORTANT MILESTONE FOR CALIFORNIA ESPECIALLY FOR C. ISSUES FINANCIAL SUSTAINABILITY AND PREDICTABILITY. IT WILL NOT FUND ALL OF THE UNIVERSITIES NEEDS AND WE VIEW THIS BUDGET CONTACT IS A CRITICAL SAFETY NET TO PROTECT THE UNIVERSITY FROM ECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. CHANGES WERE% MADE TO THIS ISSUE CONTACTED THE MAY REVISION- WE ARE GRATEFUL TO THE ADMINISTRATION FOR ADDITIONS TO THE REVISED COMPACT THOSE ARE STATEMENTS OF OPENNESS PROVIDING MORE ON GOING AND ONE TIME TWENTY TO THE CSU TO THE EXTENT STATE REVENUE IS AVAILABLE. AND BECAUSE THERE IS MORE STATE REVENUE AVAILABLE RIGHT NOW. AT THE MAY REVISION SEGWAYS TO MY THIRD TOPIC. WHICH IS THIS ISSUE BUDGET REQUEST. WE'RE CERTAINLY APPRECIATIVE OF THE ONGOING FUNDING AND ONE TIME FUNDING% GOVERNOR NEWSOM PROPOSED IN JANUARY AND CONTINUES IN MAY. THAT IS A REALLY GOOD START. THE FUNDING GAP REMAINS BETWEEN THE TOWARD TRUSTEES BUDGET PLAN AND THE GOVERNOR'S. NOW THE MOST PRESSING PRIORITY OF THE TRUSTEES BUDGET REQUEST IS FARING AND- EQUITABLE COMPENSATION FOR A FACULTY AND STAFF. SALARIES HAVE BEEN STAGNANT FOR TWO YEARS AND RECENT INFLATIONARY PRESSURES MAKE COMPENSATION AGREEMENTS EVEN MORE IMPORTANT TODAY. AN AGREEMENT WITH THE FACULTY UNION REPRESENTS HALF REPRESENTING HALF OF ALL SEE ISSUE EMPLOYEES WAS FINALIZED EARLIER THIS YEAR DECISIONS FOR APPROXIMATELY THIRTY THOUSAND OTHER REPRESENTED AND NON REPRESENTED PLAYS ARE NOW OPEN OR WILL BE OPEN FOR THE BUDGET YEAR. NOW TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE AND FULFILL THIS ISSUE BUDGET PRIOR TO A TRUST THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES TRUST- OTHER PRIORITIES. BY GRADUATION INITIATIVE UNERRING EQUITY GAPS WE ASK THE LEGISLATURE TO ADD THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS A MONTH GOING FUNDING ABOVE THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISION PROPOSAL I HAVEN'T REYES BEFORE WITH YOU IS THE- STAFF SALARIES- STRUCTURE STUDY THAT'S A LOT OF ESSES IN THERE SORRY. THE STUDY REVEALED A MAJOR FUNDING- FINDINGS IN THE AREAS OF COMPETITIVE MARKET SALARY STRUCTURE JOB FRAMEWORK AND PREDICTABLE AND EQUITABLE PAY. ADDRESSING THESE ISSUES WILL REQUIRE AN ADDITIONAL TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY SEVEN MILLION IN ONGOING FUNDING OVER AND ABOVE THE THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS I JUST MENTIONED. ALSO WE REQUEST NINE HUNDRED MILLION A ONE TIME FUNDING TO HELP US REPAIR AND MINOR RICE MODERNIZE OUR AGING FACILITIES AND INFRASTRUCTURE. NO IVEN THE STATE'S HISTORIC- FINANCIAL POSITION. I HAVE THREE NUMBERS I S. C. REMEMBER AS YOU MAKE YOUR FINAL BUDGET DECISIONS FIRST OF THE SEASON BUDGET BE INCREASED BY THREE HUNDRED ONE MILLION DOLLARS TO SUPPORT THE TRUSTEES OFFERING BUDGET PRIORITIES. SECOND THAT THE C. ISSUE BUDGET BE FURTHER INCREASED BY TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IN ONGOING FUNDING. TO IMPLEMENT THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE STEPS EVERY STUDY. IN THIRD- THAT AN ADDITIONAL NINE HUNDRED BILLION IN ONE TIME DOLLARS BE ADDED TO FUND ECONOMIC FACILITIES AND RENEWAL NEEDS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU QUESTIONS. FOR THE PANELISTS ON CSU. ALL RIGHT I'LL START HERE. FROM THE- FROM THE L. A. AS TABLE HERE WE SEE FROM THE JANUARY PROPOSAL TO THE MAY PROPOSAL AN ON GOING FUNDING WE ACTUALLY GO DOWN BY SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS. THAT CORRECT. THAT IS CORRECT OKAY THAT ADJUSTMENTS ON THE ON GOING FROM OUR AND TECHNICAL ADJUSTMENTS TO THE ESTIMATED COST OF PENSIONS THAT THE STATE FUNDS AND ALSO RETIREE HEALTH BENEFITS SUCH AS BUT I GUESS THE BIG PICTURE IS. FROM THE JANUARY BUDGET THERE'S FOUR HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEVEN MILLION FOR THE CSU. IN THE IN THE BUDGET NEW MONEY THAT MAY VERSION THERE'S FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVEN THAT'S A DIFFERENCE WHETHER IT'S TECHNICAL OR NOT IS DIFFERENCE OF MINUS SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS IN JANUARY. SO TWO THINGS HAVE HAPPENED SINCE JANUARY ONE THE CSU IT TALKED ABOUT THEIR NEEDS TO MAKE CALL. THEIR AGREEMENTS WITH THEIR EMPLOYEE GROUPS ARE FACULTY AND THAT CONTRACT- WE'VE HEARD AS FAR AS COMPACTION OTHER ISSUES WITH OTHER CSU NON FACULTY EMPLOYEES THAT I'M SURE WILL SPEAK ABOUT. SO I NEED FROM CSU FROM THE SYSTEM AND STAKEHOLDERS THAT'S ACT NUMBER ONE ACT NUMBER TWO. NINETY NINE BILLION DOLLARS SURPLUS. GRANTED THAT'S NOT ALL ONGOING LA ALSO THIS NORTH A FIFTY ON GOING AT LEAST SO YOU WOULD THINK WITH A NEED FROM CSU. AND NINETY NINE BILLION. NEW MONEY. THAT MAY REVISE WOULD HAVE MORE MONEY FOR CSU OVER HERE TODAY WITH LESS MONEY SO I KNOW YOU VALUE. CSU ADMINISTRATION AND NOW WE HAVE YOUR CONTACT WHICH- IS YOU KNOW YOUR PLEDGE THE GOVERNOR'S PLEDGE. IN THIS- IN THIS- SYSTEM OF GOVERNANCE WAS THERE'S LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR OF COURSE BUT HOW DO YOU RECONCILE THE FACT THAT WE HAVE THESE NEEDS. SO MUCH MONEY. ALMOST THE AMOUNT OF THE ENTIRE STATE BUDGET A LITTLE OVER A DECADE AGO IN NEW MONEY. AND THE- AND THE COMMITTEE INVESTMENT TO THE CSU GOES DOWN HOW DO YOU RECONCILE THAT. GENERALLY WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WELL I CAN'T SPEAK SPECIFICALLY TO YOUR COMMENT ON THE ON SURPLUS BUT THE ADMINISTRATION BELIEVES THAT THE SUBSTANTIAL YEAR OVER YEAR INCREASE PROPOSED AND THOUGHT THROUGH THE MULTI YEAR CONTACT SUPPORT CSU OPERATIONS PROVIDES FLEXIBILITY. AND PREDICTABILITY FOR THE CSU DEFINE ONGOING NEEDS ACCORDING TO ITS PARTIES AND REPRESENTS SOME OF THE LARGEST MOST CONSISTENTLY PLAN YOUR EVERY YEAR JENNIFER INCREASES IN RE GETS RECENT HISTORY TO THE CSU SYSTEM THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSED APPROACH IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY IS FOCUSED ON MEETING THE NEEDS OF STUDENTS. AND THE WORKFORCE OF THE FUTURE CLOSING EQUITY GAPS AND SUPPORT PROGRESS TOWARD DEGREE ATTAINMENT. GOALS WE WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT THE CSU AND ITS LABOR PARTNERS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR COLLECTIVE BARGAINING. HE DOES DO YOU DOES THE ADMINISTRATION THINK THAT THE SYSTEM- NEEDS MORE ONGOING MONEY ABOVE WHAT YOU PROPOSED IN JANUARY TO FIND. THEIR EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION AGREEMENTS AND NEEDS. THE MINISTER JENNIFER WITH FINANCE AGAIN- THE ADMINISTRATION IS REAFFIRMING THE MULTI YEAR CONTACTED GREED TO WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY PROPOSING GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AND BELIEVES THAT THE PREDICTABILITY AND THE FLEXIBILITY ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE CONTACTS ARE SUFFICIENT TO MAINTAIN UNIVERSITY OPERATIONS. I KNOW I ASK A QUESTION YOUR ANSWERS LIKE A PRE PROGRAMMED ANSWER OVER HERE I GET THAT THAT'S YOUR JOB BUT DO YOU THINK THAT THE CSU NEEDS. MORE MONEY TO ADDRESS THEIR AGREEMENTS WITH THE UNIONS. YES SIR NOW. THE ADMINISTRATION CONTINUES TO- FROM THE MULTI YEARCONTACT A GREEDY WHEN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET OKAY AND THEN AS FAR AS THE- THE CAPITAL PROJECTS I KNOW THAT YOU KNOW SOME OF THESE CAPITAL PROJECTS. WITH ONE TIME MONEY ARE- A GOOD USE OF ONE TIME MONEY AND THAT IS AN AREA THAT THERE WAS AN INCREASE FROM THE JANUARY BUDGET TO THE MAY BUDGET A LITTLE OVER ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FOUR MILLION I GUESS- THERE'S TWO PROJECTS THAT THEY'RE HERE. THAT THAT JUMPED OUT OF THE LION'S SHARE OF IT ARE FOR THE SAN DIEGO STATE FRAWLEY CENTER AND FULLER TEN- YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN TO FULLER TEN I'VE IS THERE RECENTLY AND THAT'S I THINK THAT. THE IF NOT THE LARGEST THE TOP TWO OR THREE LARGEST THE ISSUES AND HAS A HUGE ENROLLMENT- DEMANDS AND SO THEY'VE CLEARLY NEED MORE. YOU KNOW- LAB SPACE COMPUTER SCIENCE SPACE AND HOUSING- SO I WOULD THINK THAT THAT PROJECT WOULD BE ABLE TO HELP WITH- ENROLLING MORE STUDENTS OF THE CSU. BUT I GUESS THE QUESTION ARE ARE THESE TWO- SYSTEMS ARE USED TO ARE PROJECTS WOULD THEY BE ON THE LIST FOR CSU FOR THE HIGHEST NEED TO EXPAND ACCESS CALIFORNIANS AND CAL. IN THE CSU TEN PROJECT- I THINK IT GOES BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THE NORTHRIDGE CAMPUS OF FULLERTON WORK WHO HAS THE MOST STUDENTS IN FULLERTON AS- POTENTIALLY NUMBER WANTED NATURE MIGHT BE NUMBER TWO BUT CERTAINLY AT A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF STUDENTS IN ORANGE COUNTY. I THINK ONE THING THAT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE ABOUT THE FULLER TO PROJECT IS THAT THIS WOULD BE AN EXPANSION OF A BUILDING THAT- FIRST- WAS BUILT IN NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE AND HASN'T HAD ANY SIGNIFICANT RENOVATIONS OR IMPROVEMENTS. AND FULLERTON HAS NOT ALWAYS BEEN THE LARGEST CAMPUS IN THE C. ISSUE IT IS GROWN DRAMATICALLY IN ITS THE ONLY CAMPUS SERVING GENERALLY ORANGE COUNTY. SO THERE IS A LOT OF MERIT THERE- ONE THING ALSO WITH THAT PROJECT IS THAT IS. WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING IS TO ADVANCE THE WORK ON THIS PROJECT BY ONE YEAR IS HONOR TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR YEAR A CAPITAL OUTLAY PROJECTS- PLAN- THE MISTRESSES IS CHOOSING TO AFFORD ADVANCE AND WORK ON THAT PROJECT. RIGHT AWAY VERSUS WAITING A YEAR SELL MAKES A LOT OF SENSE FROM THAT VANTAGE POINT. SO AS FAR AS THE BRAWLEY ONE. IF IS THAT. IF YOU AN ADDITIONAL WHAT IS THE BY ONE EIGHTY NINE SIXTY SIXTY EIGHT MILLION SO IT IS THIS THE HIGHEST AND BEST USE FOR STATE MONEY TO EXPAND ACCESS FOR CS WELL I'D SAY IT'S ONE OF THE HIGHEST PARTIES OF THE SAN DIEGO STATE CAMPUS IT IS NOT CURRENTLY ON THE MULTI YEAR PLAN FOR THE SAN DIEGO STATE CAMPUS- THERE ARE SOME BENEFITS TO THE PROJECT OBVIOUSLY BEING VERY CLOSE TO LITHIUM PRODUCTION AREA. AS WELL AS REALLY A NEED FOR ADDITIONAL STEM RELATED DEGREES OUT IN THE IMPERIAL VALLEY MOST OF THE COURSE OFFERINGS AT BRAWLING ARE RELATED TO BACHELORS OF ARTS AND TEACHER CREDENTIALING DEGREES- AND THAT WOULD BE A OF A PROJECT THAT COULD POTENTIALLY EXPAND INTO THE SCIENCES AND OTHER STEM FIELDS SO THAT THAT COULD BE. BENEFICIAL TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO. YEAH THIS ONE IS- ONE THAT WE HAD NOT SEEN ON ON YOUR CSU LAST- NOR HAD WE- HAVE WE SEEN THIS FOR MEMBERS WHO WHO ARE BEEN PUTTING IN REQUESTS FOR CSU CAPITAL PROJECTS SO. WE HAVE A BIG LIST OVER HERE BUDGET NEEDS AND THIS ONE CAME OUT OF. LEFT FIELD A LITTLE BIT SOME- PLASTI VALUE IT THIS. SO I KNOW THE L. A. HAD SOME COMMENTS ON ON THIS ONE. DID YOU. THAT'S CRACKED THREE NOTED THAT THIS PROJECT AS SOON AS YOU MENTIONED IS NOT PART OF THE MULTI YEAR PLAN WHICH RAISES SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF PLANNING THAT'S GONE INTO THE PROJECT TO DATE. IT ALSO DOES REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT EXPANSION OF THE BALI CENTER WHICH IS CURRENTLY ESTIMATED TO ENROLL A FEW HUNDRED STUDENTS AND AS SOON AS YOU MENTIONED PRIMARILY IN. NON STEM FIELDS. AND SO WE THINK THAT COULD BENEFIT FROM ADDITIONAL PLANNING. GOTCHA AND WHAT WAS YOUR PROCESS PER SECTION. ON THE- THESE FULLER TO THE PROJECT. THIS PROJECT COULD HAVE BENEFITS AS THE CSU NOTED IN ACCOMMODATING ADDITIONAL ENROLLMENT AT A HIGH DEMAND CAMPUS WITH ITS PROGRAMS ALL CURRENTLY IMPACTED HOWEVER IT IS SOMEWHAT FURTHER ALONG IN CSCS MLTI YOUR PLAN AND SO IT MAY NOT REPRESENT THE MOST URGENT CAPITAL PRIORITY SYSTEM WIDE. SO WE SUGGEST YOU WEIGH THIS AGAINST THE OTHER CAPITAL PRIORITIES THAT MAY NOT RANK TOWARD THE TOP OF THE LIST FOR THE STATE. OKAY THANK YOU- FURTHER QUESTIONS FOR THE CSU YOU THROW DOT. I'LL JUST HIGHLIGHT THE ACCOUNT TO THE CHAIR AND- I JUST WANNA SAY THAT I SUPPORT THEM- THE SALARY STUDY SUPPORTING THAT TOTHE EXTENT THAT WE CANNOT BE A VERY GOOD THING- YEAH AND- JUST APPRECIATE AGAIN THE CHAIR'S COMMENTS WITH REGARD TO SUPPORTING THE CSU. AND OUR TIME HOW STARK- FUNNY AND WE SHOULD APPLY TO ALL LEVELS OF OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM IN THE STATES WITH THAT THANK YOU. I THANK YOU TUCKER TWENTY THANK THANK YOU WE WILL HOLD THAT THE CSU ITEMS OPEN. NOW WE WILL PROCEED WITH ISSUE NUMBER. THREE OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES. OKAY THANK YOU DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE PLEASE PROCEED. MORNING TURN NUMBERS DAN HANNAH WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AT THE START OF LIKE TO REFERENCE THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE MULTI YEAR ROADMAP ARRIVED AT BETWEEN THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES. THE FNALIZE ROADMAP CONTAINS CLEAR BASELINES IMMEASURABLE TARGETS FOR IMPROVEMENTS- BUILDING TOWARDS THE GOALS INITIALLY OUTLINES OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGETS- THE FOR THE TEXT OF THE AGREEMENT ITSELF FOR MORE SPECIFICITY ON THESE TARGETS. TURNING OUT TO LOCAL ASSISTANCE THE ADMINISTRATION RECOGNIZES THE LARGE NUMBER OF NEW INVESTMENTS. INCLUDED IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET ACT IN THE TWENTY TWENTY TO GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. AS SUCH THE TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE MAY REVISION FOCUSES ON PROVIDING SIGNIFICANT SUPPORT. TO THE STUDENTS SENATE FUNDING FORMULA OR SCF AND FLEXIBLE BLOCK GRANT FUNDING TO SUPPORT DISTRICTS WITH THE EXPECTED TRANSITION. BACK TO IN PERSONAGENS. AND TO ACHIEVE THE GOALS OUTLINED IN THE MULTI YEAR ROADMAP. TO THAT END THE MAY REVISION INCLUDES AN OVERALL PACING CREASE OF THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE MILLION. FOR THE ASIFA SPECIFICALLY TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION TO INCREASE THE FUNDING RATES UNDER THE S. E. F. F. AND ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION. TO AUGMENT THE BASIC ALLOCATION IN RECOGNITION OF THE INCREASING OPERATING COSTS INCLUDING THE SIGNIFICANT DIGITAL FOOT PRINTS. THE DISTRICTS HAVE DEVELOPED TO ACCOMMODATE LONG TERM SHIFTS IN STUDENT LEARNING MODALITY DEMAND VARIOUS TECHNICAL ADJUSTMENTS PRODUCE AN ESTIMATED DECREASE OF ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN POINT ONE MILLION TO THE HOLD HARMLESS. RELATIVE TO THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT THE MAY REVISION INCLUDES EIGHTY THREE POINT FIVE MILLION TO REFLECT THE INCREASE IN THE STATUTORY COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT. FROM FIVE POINT 33% AT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET TO SIX POINT FIVE SIX PERCENT. AND ONE POINT THREE MILLION TO MAINTAIN FUNDING FOR POINT 5% ENROLLMENT GROWTH. THE ADMINISTRATION DOES NOT PROPOSE STATUTORY CHANGES TO THE S. C. ABOUT THAT THE MAYOR VISION THAT ARE SEPARATE FROM THE HOLD HARMLESS CHANGE. PROPOSED AT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. THE ADMINISTRATION WILL MONITOR HOW DISTRICT ENROLLMENT PERFORM AND EXPECTS THE STABILITY PROVISION OF THE OSTEOPATH AND SIGNIFICANT NEW INVESTMENTS TO SUPPORT DISTRICT FUNDING FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE FISCAL YEAR. THE MARRIAGE AND UTILIZE A SIGNIFICANT ONE TIME FUNDING UNDER THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE. PROVIDED SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION OUR BLOCK GRANT. AND AN INCREASE OF ONE POINT ONE BILLION FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE WHICH TOTALS ONE POINT FIVE BILLION. INCLUDING THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL. BLOCK GRANT FUNDS WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO ADDRESS ISSUES RELATED TO THE PANDEMIC HUNDRED AND TO REDUCE LONG TERM OBLIGATIONS. OTHER ADJUSTMENTS INCLUDED THE MAYOR VISION AE TWENTY FIVE MILLION ONGOING FOR ROUGHLY 5% INCREASE TO THE STUDENT EQUITY ACHIEVEMENT PROGRAM. FORTY FIVE MILLION ONE TIME FOR THE CALIFORNIA HEALTHY SCHOOL MEALS PATHWAY PROGRAM. A DECREASE OF FIFTY MILLION FROM THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ESTIMATE TO THE STUDENT SUCCESS COMPLETION GRANT TO REFLECT UPDATED CAL GRANT ESTIMATES. SIXTEEN POINT NINE MILLION ONGOING PROPOSITION A GENERAL FUND TO ALIGN THE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM OURS IRATE. BUT THE SCF CREDIT RATE. AS OPPOSED TO NON CREDIT RATING. TEN MILLION ONGOING ABOVE WAS PROVIDED THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET TALK ABOUT THE NEXT UP PROGRAM. THE ADMINISTRATION IS ALSO PROVIDING- REVISING TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO REMOVE THE STATUTORY CAP ON DISTRICTS. AND ALLOW ALLOCATIONS TO BE PROVIDED SPECIFICALLY TO COLLEGES- THIS IS INTENDED TO PROVIDE MORE FLEXIBILITY ON HOW THE FUNDS ARE ALLOCATED. TEN MILLION TO ESTABLISH THE CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES SOME ASSISTANCE PROGRAM FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES. AND FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ON GOING TO BACK FILL A DECREASE AND FEDERAL MATCH FUNDING FOR FOSTER AND KINSHIP CARE PROGRAMS. TURNING TO STATE OPERATIONS THE MAYOR VISION POSES AN INCREASE OF TWO POINT SIX MILLION. NON PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND IN TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE. BUT THE CHANCES OFFICE% REFLECTS SEVENTY POSITIONS TO SUPPORT THE IMPLEMENTATION. OF THE CRADLE TO GRAVE DATA SYSTEM SUPPORT DISTRICTS TOWARDS MEETING THE GOALS OUTLINED IN THE MULTIROTOR MA'AM. ASSIST COLLEGES WITH OFFERING AFFORDABLE STUDENT HOUSING. AND BUILD CAPACITY TO ACCOMMODATE THE INCREASE AND CONTRACTS AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. FURTHER THE MAYOR VISIONS SHIFTS TEN POSITIONS THAT WERE POSED AT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET TO BE FUNDED STARTING IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR. TO BE FUNDED STARTING IN TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE. THIS BRINGS THE TOTAL BETWEEN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AND THE MAYOR VISION PROPOSALS TO THREE POINT NINE MILLION FOR TWENTY SIX POSITIONS IN TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE. WHAT HAPPENED WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. OKAY THANK YOU HELLO GOOD MORNING PAUL STEEN HOUSING WITH LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE PAGE THREE OF THE L. A. O. HAND OUT. COMPARES PROPOSED SPENDING ON COMMUNITY COLLEGES BETWEEN THE JANUARY BUDGET AND THE MAY REVISION ALL OF MY COMMENTS TO A FEW MAJOR MAY REVISION PROPOSALS BUT HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. YOU MIGHT HAVE. FIRST WE FIND MERIT WITH FOCUS SEEN NEW ON GOING FUNDS ON APPORTIONMENT INCREASES BOTH THE COST OF LIVING. ADJUSTMENTS THE COLAS AND DEBASING CREASES BEYOND THE CALL OF THAT ARE IN THE MAY REVISION. OKOLO WILL HELP DISTRICTS AND EMPLOYEES ADDRESS. OF RISING COST PRESSURES AND THEN ADDING FURTHER BASE MONEY TO APPORTIONMENT SOON AS THE STUDENT CENTERED FUNDING FORMULA ALSO WOULD HELP COLLEGES ADDRESS RISING COSTS BUT ALSO WOULD HAVE THE EFFECT OF FUNDING MORE DISTRICTS BASED ON THE FORMULA. RATHER THAN FUNNY THEM BASED ON THE HOLD HARMLESS PROVISIONS. WE THINK THAT WOULD BE A GOOD THING IT WOULD CREATE BETTER INENTIVES FOR DISTRICTS TO SERVE STUDENTS BETTER. THAT WE THINK PROVIDING BASING CREASES IS REASONABLE THE LEGISLATURE COULD CHOOSE A DIFFERENT AMOUNT OF COURSE AND WHAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSING OR DECIDE ON IS DIFFERENT SPLIT BETWEEN THE BASIC ALLOCATION THAT MISTER HANOVER MENTION. AND RATE-INCREASES AND YOU CAN MAKE THAT DECISION BASED ON LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES. THE MAY REVISION FOCUSES ONE TIME FUNDS ON TWO MAJOR PURPOSES YOU COULD SEE THAT ON THE PAGE THREE UNDER ONE TIME INITIATIVES YOU SEE THE TOP TWO ROWS THERE. SO THERE'S FUNDING FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND A DISCRETIONARY BLOCK GRANT THAT WOULD ALLOW COLLEGES TO. USE THE FUNDS TO ADDRESS LOCAL NEEDS. ALTHOUGH WE FIND MERIT WITH BOTH OF THESE PROPOSALS AS YOU BUILD THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT PACKAGE AND YOUR OVERALL STATE BUDGET PACKAGE. YOU MAY WANT TO CHANGE THE ALLOCATION AMOUNTS DEPENDING ON OVERALL LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES WERE HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU AND STAFF IN THE COMING WEEKS AS YOU MAKE THOSE DECISIONS THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU COMMUNITY COLLEGES. SHOULD BE GOOD. YEAH. OKAY PERFECT THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT. THIRD TIME'S A CHARM WAS THAT EVER AT WITH THE CALIFORNIA RECALL IS CANCERS OFFICE I WANT TO FIRST THANK THE LEGISLATURE FOR SOME OF THE CONTINUED PRIORITIES THAT CHAIRMAN MCCARTY OUTLINED INCLUDING CAL GRANTS AND HOUSING AND I WANT TO FOCUS ON A FEW AREAS- THAT- PROVIDE GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR CALIFORNIA ME COLLEGES I'LL BEGIN WITH A ROAD MAP OUTLINED FOR CALIFORNIA GIVE ME COLLEGES THERE'S GREAT ALIGNMENT IN THE ROAD MAP IN THE VISION FOR SUCCESS WHICH HAS EXISTED SNCE TWENTY SEVENTEEN. MANY DISTRICTS ALSO HAVE LOCAL VISION GOALS THESE GOALS ARE FOCUSED ON STUDENT EQUITY STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT AND SUCCESS AND RECOGNIZE THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE COLLEGES HAVE IN RISING TIDES IT REDUCING REGIONAL EQUITY GAPS AND ENSURING ECONOMIC MOBILITY AND SO WE HAVE STRONG SUPPORT IN THAT AND BELIEVE IT WOULD PROVIDE GREATER ALIGNMENT BETWEEN THE EFFORTS OF OUR COLLEGES AND HAVE STATE LEADERS JOIN US IN THESE IMPORTANT EFFORTS AND STRATEGIES. WITH REGARDS TO THE SCF AS YOU'VE HEARD FROM MY COLLEAGUES WITHOUT LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE THE PROPOSED A BASE INCREASES AND PER STUDENT FUNDING INCREASES ENSURE THAT MORE OF OUR COLLEGES CAN TRANSITION EFFECTIVELY TO THE STUDENT CENTERED FUNDING FORMULA WHICH TENANTS INCLUDE EQUITY SUCCESS I AND- MANY OF THE GOALS THAT THE LEGISLATURE SHARES ENSURING THAT STUDENTS CAN TRANSFER- I EARNED A LIVING WAGES. OR GRADUATE. WE ALSO- ARE VERY APPRECIATIVE A PROPOSAL BY THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE FOR TWENTY SIX POSITIONS LET ME SHARE A LITTLE BIT WHY. THE CALIFORNIA RECALL CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE CANNOT UTILIZE PROP NINETY RESOURCES FOR POSITIONS OR ONE OF THE ONLY SYSTEMS AND HIGHER READ WERE THE ONLY SYSTEM AND HIGHER READ THAT REQUIRES LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY JUST TO HIRE ANY ONE PERSON. AND IN SINCE TWENTY FOURTEEN WE'VE SEEN AN INCREASE- OF PROGRAMS THAT WE ADMINISTER FROM FIFTY NINE TO A HUNDRED AND FIVE WOULD STILL WITH THE SAME. POSITION OF AUTHORITY OF A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SEVEN FIRST SYSTEM THAT SERVES A HUNDRED SIXTEEN COLLEGES A SEVENTY EIGHT AT CENTERS SEVENTY THREE DISTRICTS AND ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION STUDENTS. THESE POSITIONS ENSURE THAT WE CAN EFFECTIVELY IMPLEMENT MANY OF THE LEGISLATURE'S OWN PRIORITIES INCLUDING RISING SCHOLARS- INCLUDING TRANSFER ON AND EQUITABLE PLACEMENT REFORM SOME KEY EFFORTS THAT NOT ONLY CAN HELP STUDENT SUCCESS BUT ENSURE THAT WE ARE MEETING THE DELIVERABLES THAT YOU EXPECT FROM US. SO WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT IN THESE AREAS. I WANT TO WRAP UP BY SAYING THAT WE STILL THINK- THAT THERE IS X. EXTENSIVE OPPORTUNITY AS A CHAIRMAN MCCARTY MENTIONED TO LEVERAGE THIS YEAR'S BUDGET TO SUPPORT CAL GRANT REFORM THAT'S STILL ONE OF THE AREAS AND PINCH POINTS OF OUR STUDENTS SUCCESS. CALIFORNIA SAY THAT FINANCIAL AID AND LACK OF RESOURCES IS ONE OF THEIR PRIMARY OBSTACLES TO SUCCESS AND SO WE BELIEVE THAT LEVERAGING AT THIS YEAR'S BUDGET FOR CAL GRANT REFORM IN ALIGNMENT WITH THE EQUITABLE FRAMEWORK THAT HAS BEEN ALIGNED BY. A. SEVENTEEN FORTY SIX IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY. WITH REGARDS TO HOUSING- WANT THAT'S A GREAT USE OF ONE TIME RESOURCE SAYS AN INVESTMENT IN THE FIVE PROPOSED PROJECTS AND THE SEVEN ELIGIBLE WOULD DOUBLE THE HOUSING THAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES AGAIN AND A GREAT USE-OF ONE TIME RESOURCES. AND TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY FOR COLLEGES WITH THAT I REALLY APPRECIATE THE PARTNERSHIP HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. OKAY THANK YOU QUESTIONS FOR A COMMITTEE CALLS MR O'DONNELL. THANK YOU. MY FIRST QUESTION FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE BOB WHAT I'M LOOKING- THE OVERALL THE ADDITIONS TO THE BUDGET WHICH ARE POSITIVE A POSITIVE DIRECTION- MY FEARS THAT JUST DOES NOT GO FAR ENOUGH- AS THE MEAT. LET ME EXPLAIN TO YOU WHY AT CPI EIGHT POINT FIVE PERSONS STIRS INCREASES PERSONS WHAT THANK TWO POINT SEVEN STIRS TO POINT ABOUT TWO POINT THREE FIVE ON AVERAGE IF YOU MIX THE TWO SYSTEMS SO EIGHT POINT FIVE TWO POINT THREE FIVE PLUS OTHER COST PRESSURES UNIQUE. TO TO COMMUNITY COLLEGES SOME STAFFING ISSUES- SOME DECLINING ENROLLMENT CENTER SO THAT THEIR YOU'RE WELL ABOVE 10% AND IF I LOOK AT THE NUMBERS HERE. IT'S AROUND EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY EIGHT ISSUE PROBABLY A LITTLE BIT NORTH OF THAT- OF ADDITIONAL ONGOING MONIES COMMUNITY COLLEGES OF READY PROJECTS DRUM ONE TIME I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THE ONE TIME MONEY ON SPECIFICALLY TALKING ABOUT THE ON GOING MONEY. IT JUST DOESN'T SEEM TO EVEN KEEP THEM UP WITH LAST YEAR- DO YOU HAVE A COMMENT ON THAT IN OTHER WORDS WHAT I'M SAYING IS. THEIR COSTS ARE GOING UP FASTER. THAN THEN THE INCREASE IN IN IN IN THE BUDGET. AS AS AS I SEE IT RIGHT HERE THE PROPOSED- THE MAY REVISE. DO DO YOU HAVE A COMMENT ON THAT- DANDARA BERMAN A FINANCE- SO I THINK TO ADDRESS YOU'RE GOING TO I THINK THE MEASURES AND STUFF AND WHETHER THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT COST PRESSURES BEING FACED BY DISTRICTS- AND I THINK TO THAT NO WE KNOW THAT THAT THE MAY REVISION DOES REFLECT STRONG USE OF ONGOING RESOURCES AVAILABLE UNDERNEATH THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE. TO TRY TO HELP DISTRICTS WITH THIS WHETHER IT'S THE SIX POINT 56% COLA INCREASE THE THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE MILLION ONGOING FOR BASING CREASES AND THE SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION WHICH WILL BE A ONE TIME DOES PROVIDE A ONE TIME IT DOES PROVIDE A FLEXIBLE USE OF FINDINGS THAT THEY CAN HELP DISTRICTS REDUCE THEIR LONG TERM OBLIGATIONS SO. AND AGAIN THE FUNDING IS AVAILABLE OVER MULTIPLE YEARS SO THEN I THINK THIS BUDGET DOES REPRESENT A STRONG NEW INFLUX OF RESOURCES TO THE PROPER TO THE TO COMMUNICATE SYSTEM AND AGAIN- REFLECTS A PRUDENT USE OF ONGOING ONE TIME FUNDING- UNDERNEATH THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE WAS A DECENT START I'VE JUST FROM MY PERSPECTIVE NOT NECESSARILY A GOOD FINISH BUT I HOPE WE CAN GET A GOOD FINISH AS WELL. AS THE PROCESS MOVES FOR BUT I JUST HOPE PEOPLE ON THIS COMMITTEE EVEN PAY ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT WHAT WE'RE SEEING HERE IS COSTS ARE GOING UP OR GOING UP AND THEN WE HEAR- HISTORIC DOLLARS WELL HISTORIC ADDITION DURING HISTORIC INFLATION AND STORK OTHER COST PRESSURES DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN. THAT A SCHOOL IS- THE COMMITTEE COLLEGE SYSTEM IS GETTING MORE MONEY AND JUST ANOTHER QUESTION PROBABLY FOR THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE I BELIEVE IT'S SEVENTEEN NEW POSITIONS TO THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE COULD YOU MAYBE WALK ME THROUGH I THAT WOULD BE. YEAH A LOT MORNING ASSEMBLY MEMBER O'DONNELL- IN MANY WAYS THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE OPEN NOW WE ARE WORKING WE WORK UNDER THE CAL H. R. MODEL WHICH HAS US THAT THREE DAYS AS A TELEWORK AGREEMENT A JUST A PIRATE I JUST THINK THAT'S CRAZY SHOULD BE IN THAT BUILDING WORKING TO SERVE THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM CLASSROOMS ARE OPEN THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE SHOULD BE OPEN AS IS. THIS COMMITTEE BUT THAT'S MY OPINION THAT Q. GOING SAM AND THEIR TWENTY TWO TO THREE BY RIP. ACT REQUESTED THIRTY ONE POSITIONS. AND SO THE TWENTY SIX THAT YOU SEE HERE REALLY ARE ALIGNED- WITH NEW PROGRAMS AND COMMITMENTS DELIVERABLES. THAT HAVE BEEN ADDED OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS. AND SO THESE POSITIONS- WOULD SPECIALIZE IN- VARIOUS- IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES INCLUDING TRANSFER REFORM- INCLUDING FOCUSING ON SOME OF THE- PROGRAMS THAT SERVE. UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS SINCE AND STUDENTS THAT. ARE IN PROGRAMS THAT SERVE UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS INCLUDING- RISING SCHOLARS MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS- THE IMPLEMENTATION OF OVERALL BASIC NEEDS STRATEGIES ACROSS OUR CAMPUSES. THERE'S ALSO A FOCUS ON BACCALAUREATE DEGREES WHICH IS- OF. SOME BEGAN AS A LEAD FROM AN ASSEMBLY BILL- THAT REQUIRES AN EXTENSIVE REVIEW PROCESS IN COLLABORATION WITH. OUR FOR YOUR PARTNERS AND SO- MANY OF THESE POSITIONS AND HAPPY TO WALK THROUGH IN MORE DETAIL- UP WITH A WHAT THESE WOULD TO. OVERALL AS AN AGENCY WE REPORT ON AN AVERAGE OF OVER TWO HUNDRED HOURS WEEKLY OVERTIME. AND SO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS REALLY REDUCE THAT- AGAIN BECAUSE IN SINCE TWENTY FOURTEEN WE'VE SEEN- AN INCREASE FROM FIFTY NINE PROGRAMS THAT WE ADMINISTER TO A- HUNDRED AND NINE. AND SO WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO KEEP PACE WITH THE NEW ADDED WORKLOAD- AND THESE POSITIONS WOULD HELP DO THAT. OKAY THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT PERSPECTIVE BUT- REALLY WHETHER MUCH RUBBER MEETS THE ROAD IS NOT INSIDE THE CHANCES OF HIS OUT OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES ACROSS THE STATE RIGHT. THAT'S WHERE THEY NEED THE SERVICES. SO I JUST. SEEMS LIKE A LOT TO ME TODAY BUT WILL. HAVE FURTHER CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THAT I PRE EIGHT. THE PERSPECTIVE YOU- AND THANK YOU. THANK YOU THAT QUESTION FOR THE I THINK BY THE L. A. L. SO I THINK THAT THE REVENUE FOR PROP NINETY EIGHT IS SIMILAR FROM WHAT'S IN FINANCE FROM WHAT YOU HAD ALLOCATED IN WHAT ARE. KIND OF SPREAD SHEETS AND ANALYSIS HAS PER PROP NINETY EIGHT. AND I THINK THE DIFFERENCE IS. THE ADMINISTRATION HAS HAS- MORE ONE TIME WITH ONGOING MONEY. SAID THEYUSE THE USE OF BIG CHUNK TO PUT IN DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. WHAT FOR IT WHICH IS A ONE TIME THING WITH ONGOING MONEY SO THAT YOU KNOW YOU CAN USE THAT OTHER PLACES WELL WORD OF COURSE EVALUATING THAT. AND THEN IF WE HAVE THIS OTHER DEBATE ABOUT THIS WHAT MR O'DONNELL PROBABLY KNOWS THAT EVEN WITH THIS YOU KNOW COSTS HAVE GONE UP- YOU KNOW COSTS FOR DISTRICTS EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION RETIREMENT COSTS AND SO FORTH SO EVEN THOUGH WE'RE HAVING THIS HISTORIC BOB YOU KNOW IT'S ALMOST EVEN WITH WHAT THEIR COSTS ARE SO THEN THAT OTHER PIECE THIS EQUATION IS THIS FUNDING FORMULA AND SOME DISTRICTS WERE. ARMLESS AS WE TRY TO IMPLEMENT THIS FROM A FEW YEARS AGO. WHERE ARE WE AT AND WHAT WHAT. MORE WOULD BE NEED TO GET ALL DISTRICTS TO BE. SENSUALLY HOLE WITH THIS FUNDING FORMULA WITH THE WHOLE HOLD HARMLESS STUFF SO IT WHAT WHAT MORE RESOURCES WILL BE NEEDED TO ADDRESS THE- IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FUNDING FORMULA CHANGES. SURE WE'LL JUST REGROUP WITH REGARD YEAR- FIRST- INQUIRY ON PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT THAT'S CORRECT THE- THERE IS A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT CAN CAN BE SPENT IN AN ONGOING WAY I'M PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT WHAT THE GOVERNOR CHOOSES WITH NAY REVISION IS TO DEDICATE A FAIR AMOUNT OF THAT TO ONE TIME PURPOSES KIND OF A- CUSHION IN CASE THERE IS A DOWNTURN FUTURE YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO BACK IN AND MAKE PROGRAMMATIC CUTS YU NOTED TO BASE. PROGRAM SET BUT THAT'S A DECISION FOR LEGISLATURES SIDE LEGISLATURE OF COURSE DECIDES ON ALLOCATIONS SO YOU MAY DECIDE TO PUT MORE MONEY INTO ON GOING- PURPOSES FOR THAT COMMITTEE COLLEGES ARE K. TWELVE FOR THAT MATTER- THEN THE GOVERNOR DOES ON THE STUDENT CENTERED. FUNDING FORMULA. ARE CURRENTLY THERE IS ONE DISTRICT THAT IS ACTUALLY FUNDED BY THE FORMULA. THE STUDENT CENTERED FUNDING FORMULA THE REST ARE FUNDED BY WHAT'S KNOWN AS STABILITY. OR ANOTHER PROVISION A HOLD HARMLESS PROVISION SO ONLY ONE. WE'VE STARTED LOOKING IT AT MODELING AND WHAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL- COULD DO- THAT'S SOMETHING WE'RE GOING TO BE WORKING WITH THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE AND DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE MORON BUT- IT. IT LOOKS LIKE WITH WITH THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL OR AND SOME MORE MONEY IT COULD BE. IT COULD MAKE A SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS IN GETTING. DISTRICTS OFF STABILITY AND OFF HOLD HARMLESS AND ACTUALLY FUNDED BY THE FORMULA SO THAT SOMETHING WILL BE WORKING MORE WITH FINANCE IN THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE C. ON DOING SOME OF THIS MODELING AND WORKING WITH STAFF BUT- IT LOOKS PROMISING AS A AS A WAY TO PUT SOME MONEY INTO. THE BASIC ALLOCATION OR PUT MONEY INTO THESE BASE RATE INCREASES AGAIN BEYOND THE COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT. AND BE ABLE TO TAKE A LOT OF DISTRICTS OFF THAT HOLD HARMLESS PROVISION THEY'VE BEEN KIND OF STUCK ON FOR YEARS AND GET HIM FUNDED BY THE FORMULA. MISTER CHECK THANK YOU FOLLOW UP QUESTION FOR MR O'DONNELL IT YET. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE THIS NUMBER. IT IS DO YOU HAVE A FIGURE A NUMBER- AS FAR AS WHAT WHAT IS THE GOVERNOR. IN IN THIS MAY REVISE HOW MUCH IS- BEING STATED AS ONE TIME WHEN IT'S REALLY ONGOING. DO YOU HAVE A NUMBER TODAY I DON'T HAVE THAT NUMBER IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE CAN GET THAT WOULD YOU BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S KEY TO THIS WHOLE CONVERSATION. HOW MUCH IS BEING SCORED AS ONE TIME ACTUALLY ON GOING IT COULD BE SCORED IS ON GOING YEAH SOMETHING YEAH THAT'S THAT'S BECAUSE I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT. THAT I MEAN THAT SPEAKS TO. THE ENTIRE. THE YOU KNOW. K. FOURTEEN PRE K. FOURTEEN. SYSTEM YEAH HI. WELL I GUESS I RECALLS WITH THIS BALL IS ON THE AGENDA. ONE OF THE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE SAY IS THAT OF THE ONE POINT ONE BILLION I'M GOING TO PROPOSE ONLY FOR TWENTY FIVE SO THAT'S YOU KNOW. FIVE AND SIX HUNDRED PLUS THAT'S NOT IS THAT IS THAT ACCURATE. WELL I'M THINKING ABOUT OVERALL PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT WHAT WE HAD LOOKED AT WAS ABOUT TEN BILLION DOLLAR INCREASE. IN MAY REVISE FOR ONE TIME PURPOSES AND TEN BILLION IN ON GOING. AND I WOULD NEED TO GO BACK AND LOOK TO SEE WHAT. WHERE THE GOVERNOR ACTUALLY LANDED WITH THE MAY REVISION AND HOW MUCH OF THE- THAT LATTER GROUP THAT THAT GROUP TO COULD. OF MONEY THAT COULD BE IS AN ONGOING PURPOSE. THE GOVERNOR IN FACT SHOWS TO USE FOR ONE TIME PURPOSES OKAY. MISTER CHAIR YES SIR FOR CLARIFICATION. THEN THE QUESTION TO YOU IS I KNOW YOU'RE NOT YOU NEED TO GO BACK AND REFERENCE NUMBERS EXCITED DO SOME RESEARCH. COME TO LOOK AT- CERTAINLY K. FOURTEEN THE ENTIRE NINETY EIGHT AND MAYBE EVEN THAT SEGREGATED. THANK YOU. SO BACK TO BACK TO THE QUESTION ABOUT FUNDING FORMULA WAS THERE A NUMBER YOU CAN GIVE US WHAT DO WE NEED TO. PROPERLY FUNDS THE CHANGES IN THE FUNDING FORMULA TO ACCOMMODATE DISTRICTS AND NOT HAVE ANY HARDSHIPS ON THEIR END AT RECENTLY AND IT WAS A BASE. BASIC ALLOCATION SO ALLOCATION FOR FIXED COSTS YOU COULD DO SOMETHING LIKE FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS AND THEN YOU COULD DO A INCREASES IT RATES THE ACTUAL RATES BEYOND COLA OF SEVERAL PERCENTAGE POINTS YOU KNOW MAYBE 6% OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. AND THAT WOULD GET. THAT WOULD GET THEM ALL BUT MAY BE. EIGHT OR SO DISTRICTS OFF HOLD HARMLESS- BUT THERE'S DIFFERENT WAYS YOU CAN DO THAT YOU COULD DO LESS OF THE BASIC ALLOCATION AGAIN LESS MONEY FOR FIXED COSTS. AND MORE ON THE- ON THE BASE RATE INCREASES AND OF COURSE YOU HAVE TO MAKE ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT WHAT WHAT'S IN ROME IT GONNA DO IS ENROLLMENT GOING TO COME BACK AND HOW MUCH IS IT COULD COME BACK AND- OUR OUTCOMES AMONG. STUDENTS GOING TO CHANGE BECAUSE ALL THAT GOES INTO THE FORMULA- BUT- AGAIN IF YOU GET AN IDEA IT'S NOT THIS IS WHAT THE GOVERNOR FOR POSING AS NOT. IT IS FAIRLY SUBSTANTIAL I CAN MAKE YOU KNOW SOME SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN GETTING DISTRICTS OFF THE HOLD HARMLESS AND FUNNY BY THE FORMULA. OKAY THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER RACE. WELL I JUST WANT TO FOLLOW UP FROM YOUR QUESTION MISTER CHAIR BECAUSE YOU'RE RIGHT TO BE AGENDA DOES SAY IT'S ONE POINT ONE BILLION THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR FROM PROP NINETY EIGHT AND THE MAY REVISE HAS FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION BEING USED. FOR ONGOING FINANCE WHY NOT MORE ON GOING- THE SERVER I I'D I WOULD. THAT THIS IS A PRUDENT BALANCE AT ONE TIME AND ONGOING RESOURCES UNDERNEATH THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE GIVEN GIVEN UNCERTAINTIES ABOUT THE FUTURE- SYSTEM IS THE ADMINISTRATION'S OF WHATEVER KIND OF PRUDENT BALANCE OF ONE. FRATELLO THEN I THERE AREAS WERE WE'RE WOULD WRECK TO MORE ON GOING. TO BE MORE PRUDENT TO AND HAVE A BETTER BALANCE. I DON'T THINK WE HAVE A SPECIFIC AMOUNT IN MIND. WE ARE A BIT CONCERNED ABOUT. RISK OF RECESSION AND WE WROTE ABOUT THAT IN UR ANALYSIS THAT WAS JUST RELEASED. SO WE THINK IT IS PRUDENT TO. PUT MORE MONEY INTO K. FOURTEEN EDUCATION ONGOING PURPOSE PUT MORE MONEY INTO THE- FORMULAS OF THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA FOR K. TWELVE IN THE STUDENT CENTERED FUNDING FORMULA. FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES BUT KEEPING IN MIND THAT THERE IS. SOMEWHAT OF A REST FROM THE STATE'S PERSPECTIVE OF DOING SO YOU HAVE THE RISK AGAIN IF THERE'S A RECESSION AND ALSO. COURSES THIS ISSUE WITH THE STATE APPROPRIATIONS LIMIT THAT THE STATE FACES AND SO. DOLLARS THAT THE LEGISLATURE USES WITH EVEN WITHIN PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT FOR SALAS CRUCIBLE PURPOSES MY CAPITAL OUTLAY CAN HELP. THE STATE WITH HIS OVERALL STATE APPROPRIATIONS LIMIT REQUIREMENTS SO LEGISLATURE HAS A LOT TO KIND OF KEEP IN MIND AND SO WILL BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU IN THE COMING WEEKS I COMING UP WITH THAT RIGHT BALANCE. ONE TIME AND ONGOING WITHIN PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT WHAT MIGHT BE SELL EXCLUDABLE WITHIN PROP NINETY EIGHT OR OUTSIDE OF PROP NINETY EIGHT TO HELP WITH. THE STATE APPROPRIATIONS WHEN A REQUIREMENT KEEPING IN MIND OF COURSE. SOME INDICATORS SHOW THAT A RECESSION OF SOME MAGNITUDE COULD HAPPEN WITHIN THE NEXT COUPLE YEARS SO THINKING ABOUT RESERVES AS WELL. THANK YOU THANK YOU BOTH. OKAY THANK YOU SING NO FURTHER QUESTIONS UNDER OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES WILL GO BACK TO THE TOP AND- HOLD HOLD HOLD OPEN COMMUNICATIVE SOME WILL GO BACK TO THE TOP AND GO TO THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA MAY REVISED PROPOSALS.

THE 5% BASE INCREASE OF TWO HUNDRED POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND. ANY OTHER INVESTMENTS INTRODUCED BY THE ADMINISTRATION. IN JANUARY AS PART OF OUR MULTI YOUR CONTACT WITH THE UC. THE MAY REVISION ALSO PROPOSES A NUMBER OF NEW INVESTMENTS IN THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. I'LL BEGIN BY DISCUSSING THE CONCEPTS THE ADMINISTRATION IS BROUGHT FORWARD THEY ARE. THREE HUNDRED MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND FOR A NEW INSTITUTE FOR IMMUNOLOGY AND IMMUNOTHERAPY AT UCLA. MINISTRATION ALSO PLANS TO PROVIDE AN ADDITIONAL TWO HUNDRED MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND FOR THIS PURPOSE IN THE TWENTY TWENTY TWO EXCUSE ME THE TWENTY TWENTY THREE TWENTY TWENTY AT TWENTY FOUR FISCAL YEAR- THIRTEEN MILLION ONGOING FREE- YOU SEE LABOR CENTERS SPECIFICALLY- THIS WAS INTENDED TO PROVIDE.

THE ASSOCIATION OF INDEPENDENT CALIFORNIA COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES AND TO THE ASSIST PLATFORM THIS PLATFORM IS A- A PROVIDE STUDENTS WITH US YOU CAN TRANSFER. WITH CRITICAL INFORMATION ON HOW CLASSES AND COURSES THEY'VE EARNED WILL TRANSFER TO A PARTICULAR INSTITUTION- AND AN INCREASE OF- TWO POINT ONE MILLION GENERAL FUND TO BACK FOR THE CLEANING PROPOSITION FIX FIFTY SIX TOBACCO TAX REVENUES. THAT SUPPORT A FIXED ALLOCATION OF FORTY MILLION- FOR GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION AT UC- THIS INCREASE WILL MAINTAIN THE LEVEL OF RESOURCES AVAILABLE FOR GRADUATION A GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION- AT THAT FORTY MILLION DOLLAR LEVEL- THE MAYOR VISION ALSO INCLUDES A FEW CHANGES TO HOW EXISTING PROPOSALS AND PROGRAMS OPERATE- THE MOST NOTABLE CHANGES INCLUDE ADDING LANGUAGE DIRECTING YOU SEE. TO COORDINATE WITH STATE AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS TO GUIDETHE HUNDRED MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND FOR CLIMATE RESEARCH- THAT WE OPPOSE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. TO BETTER ALIGN WITH THE STATE'S RESEARCH NEEDS. ARE THE MAYOR VISION ALSO ADDED LANGUAGE TO THE- OVERALL ONE TIME PLANET PACKAGE A TO PROVIDE LEGAL CLARITY OVER ITS USES AS IT RELATES TO UC'S NONPROFIT STATUS- ANOTHER AYE KEY LANGUAGE CHANGES THE EXPANSION OF FUNDS. PROVIDED FOR BASIC NEEDS TO INCLUDE HYGIENE RODUCTS. AND THERE ARE- ALSO SEVERAL TECHNICAL CHANGES ADDRESSED IN OUR MAY LETTER- THAT I CAN DISCUSS THAT THIS COMMITTEE HAS QUESTIONS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. AGAIN I DO APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE THE VISION WITH YOU THIS MORNING AND I- ALLOW LET THE PART. NEXT PRESENTER- SPEAK. THANK YOU L. L. GRAYSON CONCENTRA SALLY- IN CASE IT'S HELPFUL TO THE COMMITTEE IF YOU'RE WORKING FROM R. ELLIE- HAND OUT THE LOOKS LIKE THIS IF YOU TURN TO PAGE ONE OF THAT HAND OUT YOU'LL SEE ALL THE GENERAL FUND- PROPOSALS FOR YOU SEE UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AND UNDER THE MAY REVISION AGAIN IF YOU WANT TO FOCUS ON WHAT'SNEW IN THE MAY REVISION THAT THIRD COLUMN SHOWS THE CHANGE BETWEEN THE TWO PACKAGES- AS IMMIGRATION NOTED YOU KNOW THE LARGEST PROPOSAL HERE. AS OF TO PROVIDE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS THREE HUNDRED MILLION IN THE BUDGET YEAR TWO HUNDRED MILLION IN THE- BUT YOUR PLUS ONE. FOR A NEW UC LOS ANGELES INSTITUTE. FOR IMMUNOLOGY AND IMMUNOTHERAPY. SO FOR THE SAKE OF TIME OF FOCUS MY COMMENTS ON THAT PROPOSAL. THAN HAPPY TO BE AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS ON ANY OTHER QUESTIONS THAT COME UP. NOW THIS PROPOSAL IN PARTICULAR ON THE FOCUS ON CAPITAL OUTLAY IT'S A COMMON THEME THROUGHOUT YOUR AGENDA THIS THIS HEARING OF MY MANY OTHER SEGMENTS THE LARGEST PROPOSALS ARE ONE TIME CAPITAL OUTLAY PROPOSAL'S. GENERALLY WE THINK IT'S REASONABLE TO FOCUS ON A ONE TIME CAPITAL OUTLAY SPENDING THIS YEAR- STATE IS CURRENTLY FACING SOME CHALLENGES MEETINGS BUDGETARY REQUIREMENTS. AND SPENDING FUNDING ON CAPITAL OUTLAY HELPS WITH THAT. BECAUSE THOSE FUNDS ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE STATE APPROPRIATIONS LIMIT CALCULATION. THAT SAID THIS PROPOSAL IS A BIT OF A MISSED OPPORTUNITY IN OUR VIEW. ALL THE PROPOSAL- DOES NOT SEEM TO ALIGN WITH MANY OF THE PRESSING CAPITAL OUTLAY ISSUES THAT THIS COMMITTEE HAS DISCUSSED IN PREVIOUS HEARINGS IT DOESN'T APPEAR TO ADDRESS DEFERRED MAINTENANCE OR SEISMIC RENOVATION. IT DOES NOT ADDRESS AFFORDABLE STUDENT HOUSING WHICH IS A TOPIC THAT I COMMITTEES DISCUSSED A LOT. IT ALSO- BASED ON OUR UNDERSTANDING DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON EXPANDING IN MOMENT CAPACITY AT. UC OR CSU. THE PROPOSAL ALSO APPEARS TO OFFER SOME SERVICES THAT ARE THAT SEEMS SIMILAR TO THE SERVICES THAT ARE PROVIDED EXISTING USUALLY INSTITUTES. AND IN GENERAL IS A THERE'S JUST A LOT OF SIGNIFICANT LACK OF DETAILS THAT THE MATURATION OF PROVIDED ON THIS PROPOSAL. WE THINK THIS IS THE KIND OF OPPOSE A LEGISLATURE COULD REJECT THIS YEAR. AND THEN REDISTRIBUTE THOSE FUNDS TOWARDS OTHER HIGH CAPITAL PRIORITIES THAT HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED IN PREVIOUS HEARINGS. THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU L. AT UC GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN GUARDIAN ASSEMBLYMEMBERS AND SAY EVER TENANTS REPRESENTING THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SUPPORTS GOVERNOR NEWSOM'S PROPOSAL TO STRENGTHEN TO UNIVERSITY AND BETTER SERVE OUR STUDENTS TO A FIVE YEAR FUNDING COMPACT THAT OFFERS RELIABLE FUNDING SUPPORT FOR CAMPUSES COUPLED WITH AMBITIOUS POLICY GOALS. RELIABLE ON GOING STATE FUNDING INCREASES TOGETHER WITH OUR TUITION STABILITY PLAN ARE IMPORTANT TO UC CAMPUSES AND COVERING COST INCREASES AND ENSURING STUDENT SUCCESS THROUGH MORSE MORE COURSE OFFERINGS ADVISING AND OTHER SERVICES. UP WE FULLY SUPPORT THE SHARED GOALS ARTICULATED IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED COMPACT WHICH FOCUSES ON ACCESS SUCCESS AFFORDABILITY AND INTER SEGMENTAL COLLABORATION THE UNIVERSITY UNIVERSITY SEIZE THE GOALS OUTLINED IN THE MULTI YEAR COMPACT AS A CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE AND THE UNIVERSITY ON TO WAYS TO ACHIEVE THE OUTLINED AMBITIOUS GOALS WHICH REPRESENT THE IDEALS WE WOULD ALL LIKE TO SEE A CHEAT. THE COMPACT INCLUDES ANNUAL COMPREHENSIVE REQUIREMENTS. IN ADDITION TO ENSURE THAT THE LEGISLATURE FEELS COMFORTABLE WITH THE UNIVERSITIES PROGRESS TOWARDS THE SHARED GOALS WE WOULD PROVIDE BRIEFINGS THE LEGISLATORS AND THEIR STAFF- IN TERMS OF THE UNIVERSITY'S BUDGET REQUESTS- THAT I HOPE THIS COMMITTEE WILL CONSIDER- WE DID HAVE SOME ON GOING FUNDING REQUEST FOR STUDENTS SUPPORT INCLUDING SAY PAP. UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS SUPPORT AND A CARCERAL SYSTEM IMPACTED STUDENTS AS WELL AS THE UC CANCER CONSORTIUM AND WE- THE UC REGENTS ARE REQUESTING ONE POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS IN CAPITAL OUTLAY PROJECTS BOTH FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE ENERGY EFFICIENCY SEISMIC RETROFITS- AND CLASSROOM MODERNIZATION PROJECTS WE'RE ALSO REQUESTING NINE MILLION ONE TIME FOR. PSYCHIATRIC MENTAL HEALTH NURSE PRACTITIONERS AND I WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY. OKAY THANK YOU UP THE FEW QUESTIONS HERE AT THE GET GO SO THAT THE COMPACT AS FAR AS THE LEGAL THRESHOLD THERE REALLY IS NOTHING THAT WE ARE PUTTING IN THE BUDGET THE COMPACT IS A BASICALLY AN AGREEMENT WHAT THE GOVERNOR WOULD LIKE TO PROPOSE EVERY JANUARY IN THE JANUARY BUDGET. SO OUTSIDE OF THE ENROLLMENT TARGETS THERE'S NOTHING. IN THE BUDGET EVERY YEAR. STATUTORILY ABOUT THE COMPACT SEKARANG. MISTER CHAIR I BELIEVE. YEAH OKAY SO OF THAT THE ONE THING THAT IS IN THERE IS THE ENROLLMENT TARGET WHICH WE- SUPPORT HAVING. AN ACTUAL NUMBER- BECAUSE WE DID GET KINDA HOODWINK LAST YEAR BY THE UC WHERE THE SPEAKER IN THE PROTEST MANILA JUST NATURE AND THE GOVERNOR WE'RE SUPER EXCITED ABOUT IN A ROMAN NUMBER OF SIX THOUSAND AND IT CAME BACK LIKE WHAT'S THAT'S GOING TO BE COUPLE YEARS OUT AND DOUBLE COUNTED THE NON RESIDENT RESIDENT TRANSFER AND SO. WE WANT TO HAVE THIS IN WRITING EVERY YEAR GOING FORWARD THE ENROLLMENT PERIOD- AND THEN I WILL SAY THAT THE 1% IS A IS A GREAT START. BUT WE THINK THAT THERE IS- AN OPPORTUNITY FOR REALLY NOT A LOT MORE MONEY TO GO OUT AND HAVE A HIGHER NUMBER MAYBE EVEN 2% AND YOU KNOW WE SEE THIS YEAR THAT. AS SAID EARLIER AT UC ONLY BETWEEN TEN AND 30% OF OUR- QUALIFIED- APPLICANTS- GET IN. WE HEAR IT ALL THE TIME FROM OUR CONSTITUENTS I HEAR FROM A MEMBER OF THIS LEGISLATURE I'M NOT GONNA NAME WHO THEY ARE WHOSE. WHOSE A SON OR DAUGHTER. AT THE AMAZING- GRADES- THE DREAM SCHOOL WAS YOU IT WAS UCLA. THEY GOT INTO IVY LEAGUE SCHOOLS BUT COULDN'T GET INTO. THE SCHOOL HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AT UCLA SO THAT IS IT IS IT TOP- PRAYER THEY WERE GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE- PRIORITIZE- AS FAR AS- ENROLLMENT AND ACCESS A COUPLE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS- ONE WE'LL GET TO THIS LATER WITH- WITH. MR NATE COMMISSION PROPOSAL BUT WITH ENROLLMENT- NEEDS WE NEED OF COURSE STUDENT HOUSING WHICH YOU KNOW IS A TOP PRIORITY OF THE C. AND- RESOURCES FOR CAMPUS GROWTH SO. THERE'S FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS HERE FOR A ONE TIMER PREPARATION AT THE UCLA- INSTITUTE OF IMMUNOLOGY AND IMMUNOTHERAPY I DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS REALLY MEANS- AND I GUESS WHAT I'M WONDERING- IF ARE THESE ENROLLMENT AT UCLA. THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION WILL HELP EXPAND INVOLVEMENT SO THE QUESTIONS FOR UCLA UC SO DO YOU THINK MISS- SAY HAD THAT THESE THESE DOLLARS WILL HELP EXPAND ENROLLMENT AT UCLA- THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION TERM MCCARTY- DO YOU PROPOSED CENTER AT UCLA IS NOT IN THE CAMPUS LONG RANGE DEVELOPMENT PLAN. AND THUS I AM ON CERTAIN AT THIS TIME IF WILL IF IT WILL ADD ANY CLASSROOM SPACE I'LL TAKE OUT THE NOW SO CONVERSELY. DO YOU THINK IF WE PUT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN CAPITAL. TO EXPAND- FACILITIES THAT MERCED AND RIVERSIDE AS A MISTER MEDINA AND HAD THE MISTER OF ARTISTS MADE ME TOUCH ON A BIT. WITH THAT HELP EXPAND ENROLLMENT AT UC. OF YES SIR THAT WOULD BECAUSE THOSE BUILDINGS CONTAIN CLASSROOMS AND ARE MORE OUR STUDENT SERVICES FOCUSED. YES I THINK IT JUST GOES BACK TO COMMONSENSE. WE HAVE A BUDGET FOR YOU SEE WE HAVE A MASSIVE NEED FOR MORE FACILITIES AND MORE HOUSING. WE HERE AT WE HAVE NINETY NINE BILLION DOLLARS. BUNCH OF IT ONE TIME EVER SPENDING ON THINGS THAT DON'T EQUATE TO THE NEED SELL. THESE DON'T MIX WHICH LEADS TO FRUSTRATION AMONG LAWMAKERS AND THEIR CONSTITUENTS SO- DULY NOTED TAT WEEK THAT CERTAINLY I THINK THE TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT. AS FAR AS THE- AS FAR AS THE NOTION FOR. DEBT FREE COLLEGE THAT'S VERY MUCH SOME MUSIC TO OUR EARS THAT THROUGH IS. SPOKEN ABOUT IN THE GOVERNOR'S- COMPACT IDEA FOR HIS ANNUAL JANUARY BUDGET- WE THINK A LOT OF THAT IS FINANCIAL AID. WITH THE STUDENT COMMISSIONER AT TALK TO IN A IN A SACK IN THE% SECOND. BUT YOU SEE ACT WHAT IS IT I KNOW MR DRAKE SAID THAT HE HAS A GOAL OF. WITHIN A DECADE% OR SO TO HAVE ALL UC GRADUATE HOW DO YOU SEE AS A DEBT FREE INSTITUTIONS SO. HOW WOULD THAT PLAY OUT WITH. STATE ALLOCATION AND STUDENT FEES FOR EXAMPLE FROM UC. OR IS HE COUNTING ON ARE YOU GUYS COUNTING ON US TO DO SOMETHING BIG WITH THE- IN THE WITH THE CAL GRANT MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP REFORM. THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA DEBT FREE PLAN IS RELIANT FIRST OF ALL IT'S LIMITED TO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS STUDENTS SO WE WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A DEBT FREE UNIVERSITY IT'S FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS STUDENTS- AND IT IS RELIANT ON THE MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP REFORM THAT THE LEGISLATURE PASSED LAST YEAR AND A FULL FUNDING OFF THAT. SO YES IT IS RELIANT ON THE LEGISLATURE CONTINUING TO PUT MONEY TOWARDS FINANCIAL AID PLANS WE'RE ALSO HOPING THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL EXPAND THE PELL GRANT- IN THE FUTURE THAT WOULD ALSO HELP US IN THE IN THAT GOAL- AND IT IS ALSO RELIANT ON THE STUDENTS MAINTAINING A SELF HELP LEVEL. WHICH WAS SET LST YEAR IN STATUTE BY THE LEGISLATURE SO THE STUDENTS WOULD STILL HAVE TO EITHER WORK AND THEY IF THEY CHOOSE NOT TO WORK THEY CAN STILL BORROW BUT WE WANT THERE TO BE A DEBT FREE OPTION FOR EVERY CALIFORNIA RESIDENT UNDERGRADUATE YEAH. I THINK THAT'S AMAZING I JUST WANNA POINT OUT ONE SIGNIFICANT IRONY HERE- ONE IS YEAH WE THINK THAT THERE SHOULD BE DEBT FREE COLLEGE IN CALIFORNIA. WILL BE NICE TO HAVE FREE COLLEGE BUT YOU KNOW I'M NOT SURE IF IT'S WORTH THE TAXPAYERS SUBSIDIZING. MY KIDS HOPEFULLY WHEN THE GOOD YOU SEE WHEN THEY FOR TUITION I THINK WE SHOULD USE OUR SCARCE RESOURCES ELSEWHERE BUT HAVING DEBT FREE IS WHAT YOU JUST SAID SO STUDENTS WOULD HAVE TO. THE FAMILY PAYS THEIR ESTIMATED FAMILY CONTRIBUTION BASED UPON THEIR INCOME THE STUDENTS WORK FIFTEEN HOURS A WEEK AND WE PROVIDE ALREADY WE PROVIDE TUITION- ESSENTIALLY ASSISTANCE% FOR PRETTY MUCH EVERY STUDENT NEED BUT IT'S THE NON TUITION. COSTS SO WE NEED- THIS THIS CAL GRANT FINANCIAL AID REFORM AND SO DO YOU SEE AN ADMINISTRATION TALK ABOUT THIS AND PRAISE THIS. BUT THEN IN THIS IN A COMMISSION THEY DON'T FIND THAT THING THAT YOU NEED TO GET DEBT FREE COLLEGE SO THE QUESTION IS FOR FINANCE HOW CAN WE TALK ABOUT THIS PASSED THE DEBT FREE E. COLLEGE FOR. SEE IF YOU DON'T DO THE THINGS THAT YOU SEE IS SAYING IS NEEDED. TO MAKE COLLEGE DEBT FREE FOR YOU SEE STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES. THE COMPACT DOES ESTABLISH A GOAL OF CREATING THAT FREE PATHWAYS- I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET THAT CONTAINED TWO OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT EXPANSIONS OF FINANCIAL AID IN STATE HISTORY. BOTH THE EXPANSION OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE ENTITLEMENT PROGRAMS AND THE EXPANSION OF THE MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP SO PROGRESS IS BEING MADE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS A STORK INVESTMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE IN STUDENT AID AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH OUR PARTNERS AT THE- SEGMENTS. TO KEEPS COLLEGE AFFORDABLE AND ATTAINABLE FOR A CALIFORNIA RESIDENT STUDENTS. I THOUGHT I'D LIKE THAT AND THEN TRYING TO FOCUS ON HOW THE UC AND CSU CAN. WORK ON THEIR SIDE FOR ACCOUNTABILITY WHETHER IT'S GRADUATION RATES FOR YOU CSU OR COST FOR. FREE FOR YOU SEE. BUT A BIG PIECE OF THE PUZZLE HERE WAS FINISHING THE JOB WITH. WITH FINANCIALLY REFORM SO LAST YEAR WE GOT HALF WE GOT HALF A LOW I KNOW THAT SOME PEOPLE WERE DISAPPOINTED I SAID NOW IT'S AMAZING WE GOT. HALF A CUP OF WATER SO LET'S GO GET THE OTHER HALF. THAT THIS TO MEDINA WAS HERE HE THIS IS HIS. SISTER'S WORK AS FINAL YEAR TALK GETTING THIS OVER THE FINISH LINE. SO IS THERE A COMMITMENT FROM THE ADMINISTRATION. TO DO THE OTHER HALF OF THIS TO FINISH THE FINANCIALLY REFORM TO ALLOW. YOU SEE IN THE SEGMENTS TO OFFER DEBT FREE EDUCATION. THE ADMINISTRATION'S- A REVISION PLAN- CONTINUES INVESTMENTS FROM THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET ACTING LOOKING FOR TO CONVERSATION ON ON BUT AS AS WE MOVE THROUGH THIS PROCESS. OKAY I THINK YOU JUST. LAST YEAR'S AGREEMENT AND IT'S OUR HOPE AGAIN THAT WITH THIS. AT A MASSIVE SPIKE IN REVENUE SOMEONE TIME SOME ON GOING THAT WE COULD FOCUS ON ONE OF THE TOP PRIORITIES IN THE ASSEMBLY. COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY YOU KNOW THE COST OF COLLEGE IS GOING UP IT'S NOT TUITION ITS HOUSING BOOKS TRANSPORTATION AND SO FORTH SO- OUR STUDENTS NEED IT OUR FAMILIES THE THAT OUR ECONOMY NEEDS IT. SO THAT THAT THIS IS A TOP PRIORITY- FOR THE FOR THE ASSEMBLY. AND THEN- LASTLY JUST THAT THE STUDENT HOUSING. I KNOW THAT THERE'S CONTINUE MONEY FROM LAST YEAR'S HOUSING PROPOSAL- AND I KNOW UC AND CSU BOTH- HAVE BEEN FOCUSING ON THE NEED FOR MORE ONE TIME MONEY PER STUDENT HOUSING SO THAT OBVIOUSLY IS A PRIORITY OF MINE IN THE LEAD IN THE ASSEMBLY SO WILL BE PUTTING THAT FOR IN OUR IN OUR PACKAGE AS WELL- QUESTIONS I KNOW THAT- ASSEMBLY MEMBER CERVANTES IS JOINING US- TODAY HAS A GAS THIS IS AN INFORMATIONAL HEARING TODAY NO VOTING. SO SHE'S HERE AS AS A- AS OUR COLLEAGUE AND WANT TO SHARE SOME THOUGHTS ASSEMBLY MEMBER THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIR FOR LETTING ME SPEAK TODAY AT THE SUBCOMMITTEE HEARING I DO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I AM ALSO FILLING IN FOR QUALITY ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEDINA AND MAKING SURE THAT THE VOICE OF THE INLAND EMPIRE. OUR REGION IS HEARD COLLEAGUES LIKE THE REST OF YOU I BELIEVE THAT FUNDING IN OUR PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION IS AMONG THE BEST INVESTMENT WE CAN MAKE IN THE FUTURE OF OUR STATE FOR DECADES WE HAVE BEEN WORKING TOWARD IMPROVING ACCESS TO HIGHER EDUCATION YET WE MUST HAVE AN HONEST CONVERSATION ABOUT THE IN EQUITY IN THE FAIRNESS ON OUR UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA CAMPUSES. THEY ARE NOT ALL I COULDN'T BELIEVE FUNDED BROADER STATES HISTORY BOTH THE AMEND EMPIRE AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY HAVE BEEN UNDER FUNDED UNDER APPRECIATED AND UNDER REPRESENTED THIS LEVEL OF NEGLECT APLACE THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA CAMPUSES IN BOTH REGIONS. I CONTINUE TO BE CONCERNED THAT OUR TWO FLAGSHIP UC CAMPUSES CONSISTENTLY GET THE BIG TICKET INVESTMENTS ITEMS MORE FREQUENTLY- THEN OUR OTHER CAMPUSES ESPECIALLY UC RIVERSIDE AND UC MERCED WHICH IS WHY I'M PROUD TO BE A PRINCIPAL CO AUTHOR ON ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEDINA AS AN ASSEMBLY MEMBER GREY'S AB TWENTY FORTY SIX THE M. NINE RISING FUND. I WHICH REPRESENTS THE FIRST STRONG STEP IN RECTIFYING THE HISTORICAL IN EQUITY FUNDING. AMONG SO UC CAMPUSES. ALL STUDENTS. THE SAME HI EXPECT. ALL STUDENTS. OF WHERE THEY LIVE IN OUR STATE OR ATTEND SCHOOL DESERVE THE INDIVIDUAL RESOURCES AND SUPPORT TO MEET THOSE EXPECTATIONS WE CANNOT CLAIM TO PRIORITIZE DIVERSITY. EQUITY AND INCLUSION IN HIGHER EDUCATION WHERE WE IGNORE THAT SOME UC CAMPUSES SERVE OUR MOST NEEDY AND DISADVANTAGED STUDENTS YEAH IT RECEIVE THE LEAST SUPPORT. AND ONE. REFLECTED IN OUR STATE BUDGET. WE CANNOT SIMPLY RECOGNIZE THE IMMENSE WORK OUR UNIVERSITIES ARE DOING LIKE UC RIVERSIDE AND UC MERCED- WOULD THERE IMPROVING STUDENT OUTCOMES FOR OUR HIGHEST PROPORTION OF UNDER REPRESENTED HISTORICALLY MARGINALIZED STUDENTS AND HAVE. SIMULTANEOUSLY STRUGGLED TO INVEST- INSTRUCT OUR STUDENTS. I'M PROUD OF THE WORK THAT MY COLLEAGUES AND I HAVE DONE. INCLUDING SENATOR RICHARD ROTH AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEDINA. IN CONTINUING TO EXPAND UC RIVERSIDE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE WE HAVE BEEN VERY APPRECIATIVE OF THE GOVERNOR'S SUPPORT IN THOSE EFFORTS- BUT YET. WE RECEIVE AN INVESTMENTS WE HAVE YET TO RECEIVE AN INVESTMENT FOR THE USER SCHOOL OF MEDICINE. ON THE GLOBAL FUNDING SINCE ITS FOUNDING. WHICH WOULD BE PROMISING TO INCREASE PATHWAYS FOR MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS. IN THE UNDERSERVED AND ONE EMPIRE. AND THIS ISN'TJUST ABOUT GRADUATE STUDENTS ARE PROFESSIONAL SCHOOLS WE ALSO KNOW THAT AS OF LAS YEAR UC RIVERSIDE RECEIVED THE LOWEST AMOUNT OF FUNDING ON A PER STUDENT BASIS AMONG ALL UC CAMPUSES. THIS IS EVEN MORE PROBLEMATIC WHEN YOU CONSIDER THAT THE STATE ALLOCATES FUNDING TO UC CAMPUSES BASED ON STUDENT ENROLLMENT. THESE FORMULAS CONTINUE TO PERPETUATE THIS VICIOUS CYCLE OF UC RIVERSIDE UC MERCED NOT RECEIVING THEIR FAIR SHARE FINDING ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY EDUCATE OUR MOST DISADVANTAGED STUDENTS THE INLAND EMPIRE IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY WHERE THE HARDEST HIT BY KOBE NINETEEN FACES SOME OF THE WORST HEALTH CARE OUTCOMES. AND INCREASE UNEMPLOYMENT AND WHY NEED INCOME GAPS. REVERSING THESE GROWING DISPARITIES IS DEPENDENT ON OUR ABILITY TO INVEST IN A REGIONAL UC CAMPUSES TO IGNITE ECONOMIC MOBILITY WERE CALIFORNIA GROWTH IS CONCENTRATED. AS PART OF THE IRONY TO ALL OF THIS. THE INLAND EMPIRE IS ONE OF THE FASTEST GROWING REGIONS OF OUR STATE AND HAS BEEN FOR SOME TIME IN THAT YOU THE UC CAMPUSES IN OUR REGION IS CONSISTENTLY UNDERFUNDED I STATED I DO WANT TO BE CLEAR I DON'T X. TAKE EXEMPTION TO THE UCLA FUNDING- IN THE MAY REVISE. ALL I AM ASKING FOR ALL WE ARE ASKING FOR IS THAT ARE IN LINE UC CAMPUSES GET CLOSER TO THE SAME AMOUNT OF ATTENTION AND FUNDING AS OUR FLAGSHIP CAMPUSES THIS IS WITHOUT A DOUBT WILL INCLUSIVELY BENEFIT OUR MOST DIVERSE POPULATION IN OUR STATE WHILE CREATING GREATER ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY AND JOB CREATION. COLLEAGUES I BELIEVE THIS IS A TIMELY TRANSFORMATIONAL INVESTMENT BENEFITING OUR UC'S MOST DIVERSE POPULATION AND I TRULY THINK- ARE BUDGET CHAIR FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE MY COMMENTS. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER- DID YOU WANT A QUESTION FOR ANY FOR ANY OF THE FOLKS ARE JUST ONE AND PUT THAT STATEMENT OUT THERE. I JUST WANTED TO PUT THAT STATEMENT I KNOW THAT I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION ON THE ROAMING CAPACITIES AND WHERE WE CAN IMPROVE. OKAY THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTIONS. MEMBER S. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR YOU COOK YOU TALKED ABOUT THIS AT THE VERY BEGINNING YOU QUESTIONS- ALMOST LIKE AN ATTORNEY YOU SET IT ALL UP AND THEN YOU ASK THE QUESTION LATER. ABOUT THE FIVE THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS- FOR THE IMMUNOLOGY AND IMMUNOTHERAPY AT UCLA. AND YOUR QUESTION REGARDING. WHAT THAT DOES TO ENROLLMENT IF WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO INCREASE ENROLLMENT AND HERE WE HAVE YOU SEE ARE YOU SEE MERCED. EXAMPLES OF WHERE THE FUNDING CAN BE INVESTED AND IT IS SPECIFICALLY GOING TO BE INVESTED FOR INCREASED ENROLLMENT. I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE ABSOLUTELY NEED TO LOOK AT. A FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT TO UCLA AND I DON'T SEE THIS AS A TROJAN- AT I'M NOT SAYING THIS AGAINST MY BROUGH AND BROTHERS AND SISTERS. I'M JUST TALKING ABOUT THE INVESTMENT OF FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO UCLA WHICH COULD. IN MY HUMBLE HUMBLE OPINION BE USED IN A WAY THAT DOES EXACTLY AS ARCHER'S TALKED ABOUT. TO USE IT AS AN INVESTMENT WHETHER IT'S FOR HOUSING OR- TOOK TO FULLY FUND OUR MEDICAL SCHOOL YOU SEE THAT YOU SEE ARE. THESE ARE INVESTMENTS THAT WILL INCREASE THE ENROLLMENT AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT I WOULD HOPE THAT. WE WOULD LOOK AT AS WE FINALIZE OUR BUDGET. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHOI. YEAH AS A VICE CHAIR OF A HIGHER EDUCATION COMMITTEE AND ALSO FORMER- PROFESSOR AT THE SEVERAL HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS SO I AM JEANNIE INTERESTED IN HIGHER EDUCATION. AND- OR SO ON THE FUNDING AND AMONG MANY OTHER AREAS SO I- AS CHAIR IT WAS- MENTIONING THE- HI EDUCATION AFFORDABILITY AND CAN ALSO BRANDS AND THE SOME STUDENT DEBTS- NOT FOCUS ON THE AREA OF A RESTAURANT THAT'S- I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW- I NORTH IRAQ- I KNOW FIRST OF ALL I THINK- WE ARE SO PROUD OF THAT CALIFORNIA HAS A SUCH A FINE. EDUCATION HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM- HOLDEN THEY HAD TO SAY THAT THE A IN THE WORD THE UC SYSTEM SINCE CSU ASSISTANCE IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES IN THE PROVINCE THE UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES TO SO MANY PROGRAM SO. A MUNIVEST IS SO AND THEN ALSO WE PROVIDE MANY DIFFERENT- THE SCHOLARSHIP OPPORTUNITIES- THROUGH FEDERAL OR STATE GRANTS- AND BROKE MY ARM PRIVATE SCHOLARSHIPS ETCETERA BUT- IN MANY STUDENTS ARE END UP. WITH THE COLLEGES. THAT YEAH THEN I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHO ARE THE CHAU WHO. TO FALL. AMONG MANY DIFFERENT FINANCIAL AID TO PROGRAM. ARE THEY ARE. OBVIOUSLY LOWER INCOME STUDENTS THAT WOULD QUALIFY MORE MORE THAN A TO A HIGH. INCOME CATEGORY SO ARE THESE THE PEOPLE WERE FROM HEIAU. INCOME MECHELEN OR A MIDDLE CLASS. BOB DOLE'S CHAU AND THEY ARE NOT QUALIFIED TO. N- AMONG THOSE CHAU GROUPS SO I'M SURE THEY ORDER PAY OFF FOR ESTATE WORK- ESTATE EARN HOWEVER I RAN INTO A SITUATION- OF MOBILE FRIEND- AT THE DISTRICT OVER THE WEEKEND- WHO'S SO SUDDEN- S. SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS SEARCH OF COLLEGES THAT. AND A SUDDEN HE SUFFERED A STROKE AND COULDN'T WALK UP. HE HAD TO WALK OUT WITH A PAIR OF PARENTS TO HELP. IN THE- NOT BE ABLE TO PAY FUNCTION WELL AND GOOD GET A JOB BUT AS OF THE OF STUDENTS- SO- UP THE PARENTS WHO WERE LOOKING INTO THE PROGRAM SAID THAT MAY BE IN THAT KIND OF A SITUATION. HOW THE- THIS SON COULD BE QUALIFIED TO FOR SOME KIND OF A- THE LOWER. WAIVER PROGRAM AND- WHAT THE COLLEGES OF PAY ATTENTION TO THOSE KIND OF SITUATIONS SO- THE- ANY PROGRAMS TO WAS DEPARTMENTS OF DEALING WITH OF THAT KIND OF SITUATIONS AND HOW TO HELP STUDENTS WHO GRADUATE A OF SO MUCH DATA AND UP UNABLE TO FIND A JOB THAT THEY CAN PAY BACK. AFTER THE OWNER LIVING EXPENSES AND THE FOR THOSE WHO ARE UNFORTUNATE THE HEALTH ISSUES- AND ANY ACCIDENTS- A COULD HAPPEN OF TO DO YOU KNOW HEALTH AND- I AM CONCERNED THE HOW OF WHETHER THOSE ARE THE GROUP OF PEOPLE REPORT ARE- FOUR- IN THE SHADE NOT MANY PEOPLE MAY UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE SUFFERING SO I WONDER WHAT THE- INTERESTED MAY SHOOTERS TO PAY ANY ATTENTION OR ANY DATA. ON THAT AREA. THANK YOU FOR THE CALL SIR OF THE UNIVERSE OF IS VERY CONCERNED ABOUT STUDENT DEBT LOAD- THAT'S PART OF THE REASON WHY THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED COMPACT INCLUDES THE GOAL OF DEVELOPING DEBT FREE PATHWAYS FOR STUDENTS. IN TERMS OF WHO IS CURRENTLY RECEIVING FINANCIAL AID ABOUT STUDENTS CALIFORNIA UNDERGRADUATES- DO NOT OF. THE DATE THEY RECEIVE FINANCIAL AID AND GRANTS TO COVER THEIR FULL TUITION AND FEES- BUT STILL MANY STUDENTS HAVE THEIR LIVING COST OF NOT COVERED BY FINANCIAL AID AND THAT IS WHERE A LOT OF THE BURDEN COMES IN FOR STUDENTS IS THE COST OF RENT. THE COST OF FOOD- AND OTHER- COST OF LIVING ITEMS OF. THE WAY THE UNIVERSITY PACKAGES FINANCIAL AID IS WE LOOK AT THE STUDENTS PER RENTAL INCOME. OF AND THEN WE'LL LOOK AT SOMETHING CALLED THE EXPECTED FAMILY CONTRIBUTION WHICH IS IN A FEDERAL FUNDING FORMULA- AND THE STUDENTS WHO HAVE VERY LOW EXPECTED FAMILY CONTRIBUTION CAN RECEIVE CAL GRANTS PELL GRANTS AND- UNIVERSITY STUDENT AID BECAUSE WE TAKE SOME OF THE TUITION PAYMENTS. ACTUALLY WE TAKE ABOUT THE THIRD AND WE WILL BE INCREASING THAT TO FORTY FIVE PERCENT. WE TAKE A PORTION OF THE TUITION AND GIVE IT TO FINANCIALLY NEEDY STUDENTS AS FINANCIAL AID TO HELP THEM COVER NOT ONLY THEIR TUITION AND FEES BUT THEY'RE LIVING COSTS. BUT THE HIGHER THAT THE STUDENTS PER RENTAL INCOME THE GREATER THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT THE PARENTS ARE EXPECTED TO GIVE TO THE STUDENTS FINANCIAL AID OR TO THE STUDENTS ARE COST OF ATTENDING THE UNIVERSITY BOTH THE FEES AND THEIR- AND THEY'RE LIVING COSTS. AND SOME PARENTS ARE UNABLE TO GIVE THE STUDENT THE THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND A YEAR THAT IT COSTS TO GO TO A UC. OF AND THEN THE STUDENT MAY BE FORCED TO TAKE OUT LOANS. NOW THE AVERAGE LOAN AT YOU SEE IS JUST UNDER EIGHTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR THOSE STUDENTS WHO TAKE OUT LOANS AT THAT'S A GRADUATION THEIR TOTAL LOANS. OF THAT IS MUCH LOWER THAN OTHER- OTHER AMERICAN UNIVERSITIES SO WE ARE DOING FAIRLY WELL AND TRYING TO KEEP THAT UP LOAD UNDER CONTROL BUT THE OF RISING COSTS OF HOUSING IN CALIFORNIA- IS REALLY PUTTING PRESSURE ON STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES TO COME UP WITH THAT EXTRA MONEY TO PAY FOR THAT HOUSING. THAT'S WHY THE ASSEMBLY'S PLANS OF INCREASING THE AFFORDABLE STUDENT HOUSING GRANT PROGRAM SO THT THE UNIVERSITY COULD BUILD MORE DORMITORIES IT'S A IT'S A VERY GOOD PLAN THAT WILL HAVE LONG TERM POSITIVE CONSEQUENCES. FOR MANY STUDENTS BUT WE ARE LOOKING AT THESE COSTS UNFORTUNATELY. THE UNIVERSITY DOES NOT CONTROL FRONT COST NEAR THE CAMPUSES OF THE LANDLORDS ARE ABLE TO RAISE THE RENT OUT AND FINANCIAL AID IS NOT ABLE TO KEEP UP ALWAYS WITH THOSE COSTS. SURE HOPE. JERRY SUMMARIZE- AS IF- SHARON THAT IS INCURRING NOW FROM THE STUDENTS SO WHO DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH IN COMMON THAT THEY GOT OF SHOULD OWN. A GRANDES BUT NOT SUFFICIENT TO COVER EVERYTHING AND THEN THEY END UP. WITH THE MORE THAT. AND- SO IN OTHER WORDS SO THE LOW INCOME FAMILY SHOULDN'T SO WE'RE BE HIGHER- RATE. THEY HAVE THERE ARE MORE- THE LOW INCOME STUDENTS TO WHAT END UP WITH THE MOISTURE AND THAT THE CAN WE SAY THAT. I DON'T HAVE THE PARENTAL INCOME BREAKDOWN OF INDIVIDUALS WITH DEATH IN FRONT OF ME DAIS INDIAN- I WILL GET THAT FOR YOU- BUT WE HAVEN'T WE HAVE IN THE PAST HAVE HAD ISSUES WITH- STUDENTS WHO ARE OLDER. BUT OF AND COME TO THE UNIVERSITY HOWEVER AGED OUT OF CAL GRANTS OF COMING TO THE UNIVERSITY AND BEING VERY LOW INCOME HAVING TO TAKE ON A LOT OF DEBT- THE LEGISLATURE HAS TAKEN STEPS IN RECENT YEARS WITH REFORM. TO FIX SOME OF THAT LAST YEAR YOU APPROVED- A- PATHWAY FOR STUDENTS WHO COME THROUGH THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE TO RECEIVE CAL GRANT REGARDLESS OF THEIR AGE SO THAT WILL FIX SOME OF THOSE ISSUES. OF AFFORDABILITY SO IT DID YOU WELL IT DOES SAY THAT THE AVERAGE JUST DURING THAT IS EIGHTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS PER PERSON UPON GRADUATION AVERAGE AVERAGE IS EIGHT ABOUT EIGHTEEN THOUSAND FOR THOSE STUDENTS WHO TAKE OUT DEBT BUT NOT ALL OF OUR STUDENTS TAKE OUT DEBT. NOW SHE AND- DO YOU HAVE ANY PROGRAM MONITORING- THOSE WHO WHO ARE GRADUATING WITH THAT THAT THE- HOW THEY ARE DOING AND WHAT KIND OF A JOB- GO WITH THE INCOME WITH THE ENOUGH SALARY TO PAY THAT- THAT DOWN- AND OF FINDING SOME WAYS SO BECAUSE TOP I KNOW THAT- I WAS STATE AND OR SO FEDERAL. DEPEND UPON WHAT THE AREA PROFESSIONAL AREAS IF YOU GO NTO LOW INCOME AREA WHAT RURAL AREAS YOU SERVE- I'VE GOT SOME KIND OF A PROGRAM SET UP FOR FIVE YEARS TO SIX YEARS SOUTH AND CORN WILL BE. APROPOS pFIVE YEARS SAID ON ENTIRE AMOUNT B. EVENTUALLY- LOAN WILL BE FORGIVEN- WHETHER YOU GUYS THEM HOW TO- TO PAY DOWN IF THEY DON'T HAVE ANY ENOUGH CASH ARAMBULA R. ONE POCKET. OF SO WE CAN STEER THEM HOW TO ELIMINATE THE ASSURANCE THAT THE SO I THINK OF COLLEGE MAY BE- GOOD SHOW WILSHIRE GIVE THAT KIND OF INFORMATION- FOR THOSE CHILDREN SO WHO ARE GRADUATING WITH ASSURANCE TAX. THANK YOU FOR THE COMMENTS SIR- WE DO NOT MONITOR OF THE TYPES OF JOBS THAT INDIVIDUALS WITH HIGH LEVELS OF DEBT END UP RECEIVING WE DO OF FOLLOW OUR STUDENTS TO SEE- WHAT KIND OF CAREERS THEY GO INTO AND THEIR INCOME LEVELS IN THOSE CAREERS AND OUR LOWEST INCOME STUDENTS WITHIN FIVE YEARS OF GRADUATING ARE EARNING DOUBLE THE INCOME ON AVERAGE THAT THEIR PARENTS AREN'T. SO THERE IS A LOT OF ECONOMIC MOBILITY PROVIDED BY THE UC DEGREE- IN TERMS OF LETTING STUDENTS KNOW ABOUT- EMPLOYMENT PAY OFF PROGRAMS OF DEBT I'M NOT CERTAIN IF WE HAVE THOSE KINDS OF ADVISING HAPPENING THAT YOU SEE. MISTER TERRIFY MAY REBEKAH KIRK WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THANK YOU FOR YOUR LINE OF QUESTIONING ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHOI I WANTED TO MENTION THAT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET DID INCLUDE A TEN MILLION DOLLAR ONE TIME GENERAL FUND INVESTMENT AT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCIAL PROTECTION AND INNOVATION. THAT IS LARGELY FOCUSED ON COMMUNICATION AND OUTREACH TO STUDENT LOAN BORROWERS IN REPAYMENT. FOR THE TYPES OF INFORMATION PROVISION THAT YOU'RE REFERENCING WE DO HAVE A PROPOSAL FROM JANUARY THAT WOULD BE FOCUSED ON PROVIDING INFORMATION TO STUDENTS WHO ARE IN REPAYMENT ON STUDENT LOANS. ABOUT THEIR OPTIONS ABOUT POTENTIAL FORGIVENESS OPTIONS. AND OTHER INFORMATION ON HOW THEY MAY WANT TO RESTRUCTURE THOSE LOANS IF APPLICABLE. YOU KNOW YOU ADDRESSING YOU KNOW ANY AVAILABLE RESOURCES SELECT ESPERANZA MAY NOT BE AWARE SO- IF THE- UNIVERSITY HAS- SOME DEPARTMENT THE WORLD SHOULD RUN THAT THE RESOURCE CENTER OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. THE VETERAN CENTER VETERANS CIRCLE TO VETERANS AFFAIRS TO STUDENTS SO. WITH THE STUDENT THAT- AND GRADUATING AND THE THEY ARE HAVING A DIFFICULT TIME. AND WHERE CAN THEY TURN TO IT THEY CAN GO TO THEIR- IN ARMADA AND- DON'T FIND A CHILDREN EDEL FEAST AUSTRALIND. THE RESOURCE CENTER AND THE CAST SOME IN OKAY SO HOW TO HOW. TO A NORTHEAST THAT'S- JUST A SUGGEST. THANK YOU SOMEONE OVERLY THANK YOU SIR I JUST WANT TO ECHO YOUR POINTS THE POINTS THAT OF OUR BEEN MAY REALLY WELL CLEAR IS I THINK THAT WE SHOULD BE SPENT MORE INCREASING THE PASSING SUPPORTING OF STUDENTS ARE GOING TO USE THE RIGHT CLASSROOM HOUSING SPACE AS YOU TALKED ABOUT- SO WITH ALL THE GREAT POINTS OF OUR BEEN MADE BUT I DID WANT TO ASK YOU KNOW IN THE ENVISIONING FOR THE UCLA CENTER OR ALL THESE OTHER GREAT CENTERS OFFICE THE SOUND THE GREAT IDEAS. THEY'RE ALL ONE TIME INITIATIVES SO WHAT IS IN THE VISION WITH THE THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ARE YOU CONSTRUCTING A NEW CAMPUS OR WHAT. BUT YEAH. SO THE- THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS PROPOSED- IN THE MAY REVISION TWO HUNDRED THAT WE WILL ADD TEN TO PROVIDE IT. TO TWENTY TWENTY THREE TWENTY TWENTY FOUR WOULD BE FOR CONSTRUCTION YES OF THE FACILITY. A NEW FACILITY THAT THE UCLA HAS NOT INCORPORATE INTO THE LONG RANGE PLAN. RIGHT OKAY. ALL RIGHT. OKAY WELL I MEAN IT'S VERY INTERESTING I THINK I STILL THINK I SAW LINE IT COMES WITH A CHAIR AND I STILL THINK WE SHOULD HAVE MORE CAPACITY FOR CLASSROOM SPACE. AND A HOUSING THANK YOU. YEAH THANK YOU WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON. FROM THIS CODES NEXT ISSUE. HASTINGS POSTED COMMISSION. THIS YEAR NUMBER. FOUR OKAY DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE PLEASE PROCEED. GOOD MORNING CHERRY MEMBERS EXACTLY LIKE CHÁVEZ WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I WILL BEGIN MY PRESENTATION TODAY BY GOING OVER SOME CHANGES AND THAT CALIFORNIA SAID IN A COMMISSION'S BUDGET. ENTRANCE IN THE KAGUM PROGRAM. THE MAY REVISION FOR THE COCHRAN PROGRAM REFLECTS AN ESTIMATED DECREASE OF TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY POINT NINE MILLION. ONE TIME GENERAL FUND IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWENTY TWO. AND A DECREASE OF THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY EIGHT POINT NINE MILLION I'M GOING. GENERAL FUND IN TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE BASED ON THE REVISED ESTIMATES OF THE NUMBER OF NEW AND RENEW CALL GRANT AWARDEES. THIS INCREMENTAL CASELOAD ADJUSTMENT REFLECT MORE MODEST YEAR OVER YEAR GROW NICE TO MAKE COMMON EXPENDITURES COMPARED TO THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROJECTIONS. SIMILARLY AS WE OBSERVE A GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. THE LAST THREE YEARS CHAU IN MORE MODEST YEAR OVER YEAR GROWTH. THE CASELOAD DECLINES CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO LOWER PAY RATES LARGELY SCCC NCSU. THE ADJUSTMENT IS ALSO A REFLECTION OF MORE REVISED ESTIMATES FOR THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE EXPANSION PROGRAM. AND AS WE HAVE MORE EXPERIENCE WITH THE PROGRAM AND BETTER DATA WILL BE ABLE TO DO A BETTER ESTIMATES OF THE PROGRAM COSTS. AT THE COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC CONTINUES TO HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON A ROMAN. BUT THE POINT OF FINANCE BELIEVE THAT THESE SUPPLIES ARE TEMPORARY AND WE WILL SEE THIS TREND REPAIRS IN THE NEAR FUTURE INCLUDES FOUR HUNDRED AND TEN THOUSAND I'M GOING TO GENERAL FUND. AND THREE POSITIONS TO SUPPORT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW FINANCIALLY PROGRAMS AND THOSE AMENDED IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET ACT. NOW I WOULD LIKE TO P. BUT ADD TO SOME OF THE TRAILER BILL THAT WE'RE PROPOSING FOR MAY REVISION- A REVISION INCLUDES TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT ESTABLISH A MORE DYNAMIC SYSTEM. TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF ADT OR ASSOCIATE DEGREE FOR TRANSFER COMMITMENTS. MADE BY THE MEMBERS OF THE ASSOCIATION OF INDEPENDENT CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. IT ALSO CLARIFIES CRITERIA BY WHICH THESE INSTITUTIONS CAN MAINTAIN TO COVER IN A WORSE AT NINE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED TWENTY TWENTY DOCTORS. IN THE ABSENCE OF TIME I WOULD LIKE TO BRIEFLY INDICATE OF THE MAY REVISION INCLUDES SEVERAL TECHNICAL TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. TO AMEND THE GOLDEN STATE TEACHER GRANT PROGRAM THE DREAMER SERVICE INCENTIVE GROW PROGRAM AND THE STUDENT LOAN PAYMENT COURT THE FOR RATES AND COVERAGE ABILITY. I'M HAPPY TO DISCUSS THIS FOR A FEW HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. OKAY THANK YOU LET'S NOW HEAR FROM THE L. A. L. AND THEN STUDENT COMMITTEE. THANK YOU. IF YOU TURN TO PAGE FOUR IN THE L. A. O. HAND OUT YOU'LL SEE THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS FOR THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION AT GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AND A REVISION GOVERNOR'S JANUARY BUDGET IS THE DAMAGE ASSESSMENT HOW CAN COST ESTIMATES. BASED ON MORE RECENT PROGRAM DATA. THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCES ARTICULATED THE REASONS FOR THIS DOWNWARD ADJUSTMENTS AND WE THINK THAT THERE VICE COST ESTIMATE IS REASONABLE. WE ARE CURRENTLY WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE DEPARTMENT TO REVIEW SOME SMALLER ADJUSTMENTS PROPOSED MARRIAGE AND INCLUDING THE VARIOUS TRAILER LANGUAGE PROPOSALS INTRODUCED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. AND WILL BE IN TOUCH WITH THEIR STAFF WITH YOUR STAFF SHORTLY WITH FEEDBACK ON THOSE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SEE A COMMISSION GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN GUARDIAN ASSEMBLYMEMBERS I'M J. PRIMERICA ON BEHALF OF THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT THIS MORNING AND I'D ALSO LIKE TO THANK YOU CHAIR MCCARTY- FOR YOUR COMMENTS AT THE START OF TODAY'S HEARING AROUND. THE IMPORTANCE OF INCLUDING CAL GRANT REFORM IN THE TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE STATE BUDGET. NOT ONLY WILL THIS HELP ADVANCE THE STATE'S GOAL OF TRYING TO ESTABLISH DEBT FREE PATHWAYS TO COLLEGE DEGREES. IT WILL ALSO HELP FURTHER OUR PROGRESS ON THE OTHER GOALS REFLECTED IN THE HIGHER EDUCATION COMPACT'S AROUND STUDENT ACCESS AND DEGREE ATTAINMENT WE KNOW THAT AFFORDABILITY IS ONE OF THE KEY FACTORS THAT- IS PREVENTING STUDENTS FROM ENROLLING CURRENTLY- AND THAT'S BASED ON SURVEY DATA THAT'S BEEN COLLECTED BY THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. WE ALSO NOTE THAT- CAL GRANT RECEIPT IS AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT FOR HOW STUDENTS CAN PERSIST AND SUCCEED IN THEIR PROGRAMS ONCE THEY DO ENROLL AND OF COURSE HELPS US IN THE WORK TO CLOSE THE PERSISTENT EQUITY GAPS THAT ARE FACED. BY SO MANY STUDENTS TODAY. SO WE DO HOPE THAT IN THE WEEKS TO COME WILL BE ABLE TO FIND A PATHWAY TOWARDS INCLUDING CAL GRANT REFORM- IN THE FINAL BUDGET. I'LL NOW TURN MY COMMENTS TO- WHAT IS INCLUDED IN THE MAY REVISION THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PRESENTED. AT THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION IS GRATEFUL FOR THE GOVERNOR INCLUDING ADDITIONAL POSITIONS AND FUNDING FOR THE COMMISSION IN THE MAY REVISION BRINGING THE TOTAL NEW PROPOSED POSITIONS AFTER JANUARY IN MAY REVISION. TO EIGHT POSITIONS- WELL WE APPRECIATE THE RECOGNITION OF INDUSTRIAL CAPACITY NEEDS A THE COMMISSION WE DO NOT FEEL THIS ADEQUATELY ADDRESSES THE RESOURCING NEEDS TO MAINTAIN HIGH QUALITY EXPERIENCES FOR STUDENTS. FOR HIGHER EDUCATION CAMPUS STAFF PARTNERS- AND IN OUR INITIAL REQUEST THIS DO NEED COMMISSION HAD REQUESTED TWENTY SEVEN POSITIONS IN ONE TIME FUNDING FOR I. T. CONSULTING SERVICES. THE AS YOU NOTED IN YOUR COMMENTS EARLIER THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO STATE BUDGET MADE HISTORIC INCREASES TO FINANCIAL AID THAT ALLOW US TO BETTER SERVE MORE. HOWEVER THESE INCREASES WERE NOT PAIRED WITH INCREASES TO THE RESOURCES THAT THE COMMISSION RECEIVES TO IMPLEMENT THESE PROGRAMS. FUNDS MANAGED BY THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION INCREASED FROM TWO POINT SIX NINE BILLION IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. TO A PROPOSED LEVEL OF THREE POINT FIVE FIVE BILLION IN THE MAY REVISION THAT YOU'RE CONSIDERING TODAY. 32% INCREASE. AND THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION IS STILL DMINISTERING OVER ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME FUNDS THAT WERE APPROPRIATED AND LAST YEAR'S BUDGET. SO WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT BOTH THE PROPOSED LEVELS OF FUNDING FOR TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE AND THOSE ONE TIME DOLLARS THAT WE'RE STILL MANAGING. THAT'S ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS MORE THAN WAS APPROPRIATED TO THE COMMISSION IN TWENTY. TWENTY ONE- THAT'S A LISTINGS BUDGET THAT WE'RE MANAGING. THAT OVER THAT SAME PERIOD THIS DO NEED COMMISSIONS RECEIVED ONLY THREE MILLION DOLLARS MORE AN ANNUAL STATE OPERATIONS FUNDING THAT'S ASSUMING THAT THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION WILL STRETCH OUR RESOURCES OVER THE LIFESPANS OF THESE NEW PROGRAMS. SOME OF WHICH WILL. BE MANAGING FOR UP TO NINE YEARS. THAT'S ABOUT A FUNDING LEVEL AND OVER THIS TIME THERE'S BEEN A 0% INCREASE NO NEW STAFF POSITIONS THAT HAVE YET BEEN AUTHORIZED FOR THE COMMISSION. WE ARE OF COURSE THRILLED TO SEE THE GOVERNOR AND LEGISLATURE PRIORITIZE COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY BUT TO SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT THESE PROGRAMS WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION IS ADEQUATELY RESOURCE. THE COMMISSION IS ALSO- ANTICIPATING OTHER NEW WORKLOADS THAT HAVE BEEN DRIVEN BY STATUTORY CHANGES AT THE STATE AND THE FEDERAL LEVEL. AND WE OF COURSE LOOK FORWARD TO THE NEW APPROACH TO FINANCIAL AID COMPLETION FOR HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS THAT WAS REFLECTED IN ASSEMBLY BILL FOUR SIXTY NINE AND CHAMPION BY MAJORITY LEADER REYES- THAT TAKES EFFECT THIS FALL. AND ANTICIPATING THE ADDITIONAL A REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE FROM STUDENTS AND FAMILIES AS WELL AS OUR HIGH SCHOOLS THAT ARE GOING TO BE HELPING STUDENTS APPLY FOR AID WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION CAN MEET THAT DEMAND FOR ADDITIONAL SEE ZACKS SUPPORT STAFF FOR HIGH SCHOOL PARTNERS. TRAINING EFFORTS DATA SHARING WITH K. TWELVE OUTREACH MATERIALS AND RESOURCES AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS ALSO MOVING FORWARD WITH STREAMLINING OF THE FREE APPLICATION FOR FEDERAL STUDENT AID THE FACTS UP THESE CHANGES REQUIRE THAT THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION UPDATE OUR GRANT PROCESSING SYSTEMS AND MAKE A pLANDING CHANGES TO THE CALIFORNIA DREAM ACT APPLICATION. THAT WE ADMINISTER FOR IMMIGRANT AND UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS GIVEN THOSE TWO MAJOR UPCOMING PROJECTS THAT CONTINUE TO WORK ON OTHER FRONTS FOR OUR I. T. DIVISION I HAVE TO POINT OUT. THAT THE SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND AND ONE TIME FUNDS WE REQUESTED FOR IT CONSULTINGSERVICES WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THE MAY REVISION AND REVIEW THAT IS A REALLY CRITICAL INVESTMENT TOWARDS SUCCESS AND TO MITIGATE RISKS THAT WOULD EMERGE IF WE DIVERT EXISTING IT STAFF. TO THOSE PROJECTS. SO FINALLY I'LL JUST NOTE THAT THOSE NEEDS I'VE ADDRESSED REFLECT CURRENT WORKLOAD AT THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION WE KNOW WHEN WE LOOK FOR TWO OTHER PROPOSALS BEING CONSIDERED IN THE BUDGET THIS YEAR. AND LEGISLATION AND JUST WOULD ASK THAT THE GOVERNOR AND LEGISLATURE CONTINUE TO THINK ABOUT THE APPROPRIATE RESOURCES FOR C. SACK. TO MEET. THESE NEEDS AND TO HIT THE MARK FOR STUDENTS. THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU YOU KNOW WE START TALKING ABOUT THIS AT THE OUTSET. AND THEN WITH. THE UC- ITEM AS WELL. THIS IS A TOP PRIORITY OF THE ASSEMBLY I NOTE THE SENATE AS WELL- YOU KNOW EXPANDING FINANCIAL AID TO EXPAND COLLEGE. OPPORTUNITY VIA COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY AND SO- YOU KNOW WE'VE DONE SOME GREAT WORK IN THE CAL GRANT REFORM MERION I THINK YOU KNOW THE MINISTRATION THE GOVERNOR AND A NON OF WHICH I KNOW WE TRY TO KEEP. CONVERSATIONS PRIVATE SOMETIMES BETWEEN US. AND THE GOVERNOR BUT LET ME TELL YOU WHAT THE GOVERNOR AND I TALKED ABOUT. YEAR AGO WHEN HE WAS SIGNING THE HIGHER READ BILLS. DOWN IN LOS ANGELES- HE WASN'T SIGNING THE CAL GRANT REFORM BILL THAT DATES I KNEW THAT WAS AGAIN THE SIGNATURE. AND I SAW HIM. THE I SAID YOU KNOW GOVERNOR I KNOW REALIZE THAT WE'RE NOT SAYING THAT BILL TODAY. AND HE SAYS YEAH THAT'S KIND OF A BUDGET THING AND I SAID WELL GOD REST WILL IT YOU KNOW THAT. YOU KNOW WELL SOME OF THE ADVOCATES ARE DISAPPOINTED. I'M NOT BECAUSE THE GLASS WAS YOU KNOW A TO. YOU KNOW TWO BILLION DOLLAR GLASS AND- AND WE SENSUALLY CAUGHT. IN I'M NOT A SIX TWO BY MISTAKE WE GOT HALF HAPPEL THAT CLASS IS ACTUALLY. AND GARCIA SO CAN HE COME BACK THE NEXT KEEP COMING BACK AND SO THAT'S IT THAT'S A WORK WHERE WE'RE DOING HERE TODAY. AND- IT'S A BIG PART OF OUR- VISION FOR CALIFORNIA IS- HAVING MORE STUDENTS GRADUATE WITHOUT MASSIVE DEBT LOADS AND- FRANKLY MORE STUDENTS GRADUATING IN FOUR YEARS. GETTING IN THE WORK FORCE FILLING THE JOBS OF TODAY AND TOMORROW. AND WE REALIZE WE HAVE SOME OF THEM THE MONEY'S IN- THE BUDGET THIS YEAR FROM LAST YEAR'S DEAL AGAIN KIND OF WHAT I SPOKE TO THE GOVERNOR ABOUT- BUT I WILL NOTE THAT THE UC DID TALK ABOUT THIS. VISION FOR DEBT FREE COLLEGE. AND THE WAY THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IS THIS. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND LESS UC'S GONNA JACK OF STUDENT FEES WHICH I DOUBT THEY'RE GONNA DO UNLESS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DROPS INFUSION OF. FINANCIAL AID MONEY MAYBE THE SLIGHTLY INCREASED PALO HELP BUT THE LYNCH PIN TO DEBT FREE IS THIS THING HERE SO WHAT IS THE VISION. IN THE OUT YEARS TO MAKE THIS REALITY TO MAKE COLLEGE DEBT FREE IN CALIFORNIA. I'M IN FINANCE. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION CHAIR- I WOULD JUST SAY THAT THE ADMINISTRATION BUDGET IS COMMITTED TO A SUSTAINABLE USE OF STATE FINANCIAL AID RESOURCES AT THE BUDGET PROVIDES DIFFERENT- RESOURCES THROUGH THE COMMITMENT WITH THE DIFFERENT SECTORS- HOUSING AND THE AS YOU MENTION LAST YEAR WE HAVE THE BIGGEST INVESTMENT IN THE KAKERA REFORMISTS INSISTS AND NACHMAN. ANY PROVIDED FINANCIALLY FOR ALL THAT COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS WHO CURRENTLY DIDN'T QUALIFY FOR THE PROGRAM- DEMONSTRATION REFLECTS THE NEEDED- CAUTION FISCAL BUDGET OUT WILL AT THE SAME TIME MEDIAN THAT THE MASS OF- PROVIING FINANCIALLY FOR THE STUDENTS- AND BUT WE'RE HAPPY TO TAKE YOUR COMMENTS BACK. YEAH AND AGAIN WE DON'T WE WANT TO KEEP WORKING ON THIS AND I DOUBT I'LL TAKE THAT- BUT YOU SAID EARLIER. THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT YOU THINK IS IMPORTANT I'M TALKING TO. MR HOUSE PUMP NOW I PENSION PAYMENT. SWELLED YES THIRTY- THIS IS A PIECE OF THE PUZZLE- SO THE OTHER THING IS THAT WE SAW. IN THE L. A. L. OUTLINED THAT THE MONEY THAT WE NEED TO FIND OUR CURRENT CAL GRANT MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP ESSENTIALLY HAS GONE DOWN. BY THREE HUNDRED FIFTEEN MILLION THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS. I WILL NOTE THAT THE PROPOSAL THAT MR MEDINA AND I ARE PUTTING TOGETHER THIS THREE HUNDRED FIFTEEN MILLION. SO THREE TWENTY EIGHT SOUNDS A LOT LIKE. THREE FIFTEEN SO HOW DID THESE THINGS CHIVE SINCE WE HAVE THIS SOFTENING IN AND MONEY IS NEEDED. FOR THIS TO GET COMMISSION WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE THESE CHANGES. SO DOES ANYBODY WANT TO MISTER CHAIR- FINANCE VIEWS THAT. THIS CHANGE OF OPPOSING IN THE CASE OF THIS TRANSITORY- OBVIOUSLY THE PANDEMIC HAS HAD A NUMBER OF IMPACTS ON A ROLL NECK ROAD WE BELIEVE THAT THAT TREND WILL REVERSE. AND THE PROGRAM WILL CONTINUE TO GROW AT PACES WE'VE SEEN IN THE PAST- AND- MISTER CHAIR YOU CAN FEEL FREE TO CALL ME JACK. OKAY THANK YOU JACK. MISS RICHARD MAGISTAD ONE BRIEF COMMENT ON THAT POINT. UP WHICH IS JUST THAT AT THIS TIME WHERE WE HAVE THE SUPPRESSED LEVELS OF ENROLLMENT AT OUR INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION- PART OF THE PROPOSAL THAT'S REFLECTED IN LEGISLATION AS YOU KNOW IS TO ENSURE THAT ANY CURRENT RECIPIENTS. OF OUR CAL GRANT PROGRAMS WOULD BE GRANDPARENT IT IN AND WOULD BE- PERMITTED TO RETAIN THEIR CALTRAIN ELIGIBILITY AS WE MOVE TO A NEW SIMPLIFIED SYSTEM FOR FINANCIAL AID. SO FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THINKING ABOUT THE ONE TIME COSTS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS TRANSITION- THE MOST. THE LEAST EXPENSIVE- TIME IS FOR US TO MOVE AHEAD WITH ME REFORMING THE CAL GRANT PROGRAMS WHEN YOU HAVE THE FEWEST STUDENTS- TO GRANDPARENT IN. BASED ON THEIR PRIOR ELIGIBILITY SO THIS WOULD- WE BELIEVE LIKELY RESULT IN DECREASED ONE TIME TRANSITION COSTS FOR THAT GRAND PARENTING PERIOD AND YOUR POINT- THAT THREE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION ONGOING. WAS BASED ON THE PRIOR ESTIMATES OF STUDENT MOMENT PARTICIPATION SO WE'LL BE WORKING UPDATE THOSE NUMBERS BUT CERTAINLY- THREE FIFTEEN LESS THAN THE THREE TWENTY EIGHT. YEAH AND I WOULD JUST ARGUE THE OBVIOUS AT THIS WOULD SOFTEN THE IMPLEMENTATION COST OF IT AS WE LOOK TO FOCUS ON. THE OUT YEARS AND SO AGAIN THIS IS GONNA BE IN OUR PROPOSAL. IT IS A TOP- ASSEMBLY PRIORITY IN A NOTE THIS WAS A TOP PRIORITY IN THE SENATE- THERE BUDGET PROPOSAL AS WELL SO- WE'LL WE'LL WE'LL STAY TUNED IN YEAH WE DID LAST YEAR. HAD THE LARGEST INCREASE- OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND NEEDY COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS FINANCIALLY NEEDY. DID COMMITTEE CALL CENTER NOW BEING ABLE TO BE. A SERVICE OF THE LARGEST INCREASE SINCE YOU KNOW DEPUTIES WROTE THE BILL IN TWO THOUSAND SO TWENTY TWO YEARS SO THAT THIS IS SIGNIFICANT. AND- BUT- WE THINK THAT THERE'S STILL TOO MUCH CONFUSION PEOPLE APPLY YOU KNOW WE HAVE ALL THESE RULES TO KEEP PEOPLE OUT. AS OPPOSED TO FOCUSING ON HOW DO WE MAKE STUDENTS. ELIGIBLE SO MEMBER REYES. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I WANT TO BEGIN BY THANKING YOU BECAUSE YOUR YOUR LEADERSHIP IN THIS AREA I THINK THAT PUTTING THE EMPHASIS ON THE FACT THAT FINANCIAL AID IS AT THE TOP IF WE DO WANT COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY WE'VE GOT TO FIND WAYS TO HELP OUR STUDENTS AND I THINK THAT THE REQUEST BY- BY C. SACK OF FOR THE ADDITIONAL STAFF. AND I DO APPRECIATE THAT WE'VE GIVEN YOU EXTRA WORK WITH THE FINANCIAL AID REQUIREMENT IN AB FOUR SIX NINE AND I'M REALLY PROUD OF THE WORK THAT WE'RE ABLE TO DO AND MAKING SURE THAT THAT GOT PASSED AND SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR BECAUSE THE MORE STUDENTS KNOW THE MORE THEY THEY THEY- THEY ARE TOLD THAT THEY HAVE TO PUT HER FINANCIAL AID ONCE A FINANCIALLY FORM WAS FILLED OUT THE MORE LIKELY TO GO TO COLLEGE WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT WE WANT. BUT AS CHAIRMAN- MCCARTY WAS SAYING WE'VE GOT TO LOOK AT COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY AND THE BEST WAY TO TAKE CARE OF THAT AS YOU KNOW IS THAT THE LEGAL QUESTION QUESTIONING CROSS EXAMINATION WAS BEING DONE EARLIER- BUT WHAT IS NEEDED IT'S A FINANCIALLY PACKAGE- YOUR REQUEST FOR THE TWENTY SEVEN ADDITIONAL POSITIONS PLUS ONE I. T. I. IT JUST SEEMS ABSOLUTELY REASONABLE I RECOGNIZE WE GOT EIGHT POSITIONS WERE. ON THE RIGHT. TRACK THERE- ALSO YOU USE MAN THAT THE SOME HUNDRED FOR THOUSAND ONE TIME FOR I. T. AND IN IN OUR. THE AGENDA TO ABOUT THE THAT ARE CAL GRANT PROGRAMS IS. OUTDATED TOO COMPLICATED AND IS UNAVAILABLE TO MORE THAN A HUNDRED THOUSAND. NEEDY CALIFORNIA CALLED STUDENTS SO MY QUESTION TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IS WHY DIDN'T THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSED CHANGE IN THAT AREA. I'M SORRY- MAJORITY LEADER- AND WHICH TO SPECIFIC AREA. SPECIFICALLY WITH THE I. T. THAT TRY TO MAKE THIS THAT THE CAL GRANT PROGRAMS MORE ACCESSIBLE LESS COMPLICATED AND JUST BRING IT UP TO DATE. YEAH SO LAST YEAR AND THE PREVIOUS YEAR WE HAVE THE GRANT DELIVERY SYSTEM MODERNIZATION ACT WHICH PROVIDE ENOUGH FUNDING FOR SEASIDE TO UPDATE THEIR WEBSITE AN OLDER BACK IN ON THE I. T. POOR STILL THERE ARE STILL CURRENTLY UPDATING ALL THOSE- EFFORTS ABOUT SHOULD PROVIDE A LOT MORE EFFICIENCY FOR THE PROGRAM IT. I'M JUST ARE YOU UNDER THE BUS OR BUSINESS YEAH MISTER JEFF I MAY JUST ADD. MAJORITY METER RATES WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THOSE COMMENTS IN YOUR LEADERSHIP ON HELPING MORE STUDENTS APPLY FOR AN ACCESS FINANCIAL AID WE ARE REALLY EAGER TO HELP PARTNER WITH OUR HIGH SCHOOLS AND LOCAL PARTNERS TO CARRY THAT THROUGH THIS FALL- I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT THE GRANT DELIVERY SYSTEM MODERNIZATION PROJECT HAS ALREADY CHANGED THE USER EXPERIENCE FOR ACCUSERS THE STUDENTS- THESE IT CONSULTING SERVICES NEEDS- THAT I'VE REFERENCED- IN MY COMMENTS. ARE ACTUALLY CREATED BY NEW STATUTORILY TRIPPIN MANDATES ON THE COMMISSION AROUND BOTH- THE FINANCIALLY COMPLETION REQUIREMENT SO THAT WE COULD PROVIDE BETTER AND MORE ACCURATE DATA TO OUR K. TWELVE PARTNERS IMPLEMENTING THAT REQUIREMENT SO THEY KNOW WHICH STUDENTS HAVE APPLIED AND WHO HAS. NOT YET- AND IT'S ALSO NEEDED IN ORDER FOR US TO A DR GRANT PROCESSING SYSTEM TO ALIGN WITH FEDERAL CHANGES TO THE FASTER THAT WILL HOPEFULLY ALSO RESULT IN AN EASIER EXPERIENCE FOR STUDENTS THE REQUESTED THAT THEY HAVE TO ASK BUT A DIFFERENT WAY THAT WE NEED TO PROCESS THEIR DATA FOR WORK PURPOSES. AND I APPRECIATED THAT THE COMMENTS FROM INSTRUCTORS GABBY IT'S GREAT TO HAVE YOU HERE TO PROVIDE THE INPUT SO THAT WE KNOW WHAT HAD THAT THE FUNDING THAT HAS BEEN FOR ABOUT PROVIDED. AND WE KNOW HOW IT'S ALREADY BEING USED AND WHERE WE NEED TO GO I THINK THAT THE EASIER. WE MAKE THIS THE BETTER TO THIS STUDENTS TO RIGHT THE SAME THING WE WANT TO INCREASE. AND WE COLLEGE FOR. WE WANT THEM WE WANT OUR STUDENTS TO COME OUT. DEBT FREE- BY THE TIME THEY THEY LEAVE. I REALLY APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT'S BEING DONE IN THIS AREA. RECOGNIZING THAT THIS IS CENTRAL TO EVERYTHING ELSE THAT WE'RE DOING WHETHER IT'S COMMUNITY COLLEGES WHERE THE UC USER OF THE CSU'S. MAKING SURE THAT FINANCIAL AID IS TAKEN CARE OF AND- WE MAKE IT AS UNCOMPLICATED AS POSSIBLE. BECAUSE THIS IS OUR GREATEST INVESTMENT RIGHT HERE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU EXCELLENT- COMMENTS MR LEE YEAH COME HERE NOW FOR TO TRY. OKAY THE WHOLE THIS ISSUE OPEN. LAST ISSUE THAT THAT WE HAVE TO MARIE SHE'S WE'RE NOT GOING TO DO THE VOTE ONLY WE WILL HEAR THAT NAY REVISED PROPOSALS FROM HASTINGS BRIEFLY AND THEN THE STATE LIBRARY AND THEN GET TO PUBLIC COMMENT HE SINGS COLLEGE OF LAW COLLEGE OF LAW FUNDED BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN SAN FRANCISCO. FORMALLY KNOWN AS A WORD WITH THE LETTER H. ALL. THAT ABOUT THAT ABOUT RIGHT. GOOD MORNING M. S. JR MEMBERS JEFF WELTMAN FINANCE THE MAY REVISION PROPOSES TO INVESTMENTS AT UC HASTINGS COLLEGE OF THE LAW- THE FIRST IS NINETY MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND FOR THE ONE HUNDRED MCALLISTER STREET PROJECT- ONE HUNDRED MCALLISTER STREET IS A MULTI USE BUILDING- THAT HAS BOTH STEAKHOUSING AND- ACADEMIC SPACE THE BUILDING CONSTRUCTED IN NINETEEN TWENTY NINE- IS IN NEED OF CRITICAL IMPROVEMENTS- PARTICULARLY RELATING TO SEISMIC RISKS- THESE RESOURCES WILL MAKE THE FINISH OF THE PROJECT FINANCIALLY VIABLE- ALONG WITH OTHER- FINANCING- ORGANIZED BY- HASTINGS. THE SECOND INVESTMENT IS EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND ONE TIME GENERAL FUND. TO SUPPORT PROCESSES HERE WITH CHANGING THE NAME OF THE INSTITUTION OUR FINANCE LETTER ALSO INCLUDES PROVISIONAL BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE RESTRICTING THE RELEASE OF THOSE FUNDS. UNTIL THE PROCESS OF- CHANGING THE NAME IS COMPLETE- THANK YOU I'M READY TO TAKE QUESTIONS AT THE PUMP. OKAY THANK YOU L. L. FACING HER SELLING L. IF YOUR PHONE ALONG ON THE OTHER HAND OUT WE'RE NOT CURRENTLY ON PAGE SIX. NOT AGAIN SHOWS THE HASTINGS GENERAL FUND PROPOSALS UNDER GOVERNOR'S BUDGET MAY REVISION. ALL FOCUS MY COMMENTS FOR THE SAKE OF TIME ON WHAT IS BY FAR THE LARGEST OF THE TWO PROPOSALS WHICH IS THE- MCALLISTER TOWER ON RENOVATION PROJECTS. NOW THIS PROJECT IS A CRITICAL SEISMIC RENOVATION PROJECT. AHMED HAS MUCH BETTER BACK UP IN MANY OF THE OTHER MAY REVISION PROPOSALS ON THAT THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSING. AND AS WE NOTED PREVIOUSLY IT'S REASONABLE FOR THE STATE TO- START SPENDING ONE TIME FUNDING ON CAPITAL PROJECTS GIVEN SOME OF THE BUDGETARY CONSTRAINTS FACING THIS YEAR. THAT SAID. WE DON'T WANT TO RAISE THREE ISSUES FOR CONSIDERATION AS YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT THIS PROJECT. THE FIRST IS THAT THIS PROJECT IS BEING PROPOSED OUTSIDE OF THE OF AFFORDABLE STUDENT HOUSING GRANT PROGRAM- THAT THIS COMMITTEE HAS PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED IF YOU RECALL THIS HE SINGS ACTUALLY SUBMITTED A GROUP APPLICATION TO PARTICIPATE IN THAT PROGRAM AND WAS DEEMED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO BE INELIGIBLE. ON BECAUSE THE LEGISLATURE HASN'T FINALIZED HOW IT INTENDS TO REFLECT PROJECTS IN THE GRANT PROGRAM IT'S DIFFICULT TO ASSESS. HOW THIS. SPECIFIC PROJECT- IT'S CHECKS UP AGAINST THOSE OF OTHER PROJECTS IN THE GRANT PROGRAM. THE SECOND ISSUE I WANT TO RAISE IS THAT- ACCORDING TO HASTINGS BECAUSE THIS. PROPOSAL WOULD SPONSOR THE MINIMUM AMOUNT NEEDED TO MAKE THE PROJECT FINANCIALLY FEASIBLE THE PROPOSED RENTS FOR THE BUILDING WOULD BE ABOUT 30% OF EIGHTY PERCENT. OF THE SCHOOLS AREA MEDIAN INCOME. THAT'S HIGHER THAN THE EXPECTATION- SET FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS IN THE GRANT PROGRAM WHICH IS ANOTHER ISSUE WE WANT TO RAISE FOR CONSIDERATION IS THAT- THIS IS A HOUSING PROPOSAL- HOUSING PROPOSALS- TEND TO BE. SELF SUPPORTED FROM STUDENT FEE REVENUE BY CONTRAST ACADEMIC PROJECTS TEND TO BE TEND TO NOT HAVE THAT SORT OF FEEL ABILITY OF SELF SUPPORTING FEE REVENUE. AND THE UNIVERSITIES HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL SEISMIC RENOVATION BACKLOGS- FOR THE ACADEMIC FACILITIES WE RECOMMEND YOU KEEP THAT IN MIND WHEN YOU'RE WEARING THIS PROPOSAL. THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU MISTER STEWART WITH THE COLLEGE OF LAW. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- HAPPY TO BE HERE TODAY. THE THE MAY REVISE ADDRESSES TWO OF THE CRITICAL ISSUES THAT ARE FACING THE COLLEGE TODAY. OF FIRST IS THE NAME CHANGE ISSUE AND WE ARE WORKING DILIGENTLY WITH WOMEN RAMOS AS WELL AS SENATOR UMBERG ON THE SENATE SIDE TO PURSUE. AND SUPPORT AB NINETEEN THIRTY SIX WHICH IS A NEW FOR MAKING ITS WAY THROUGH THE OF THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS- SO THIS FINANCIAL SUPPORT WE A WILD. YOU ARGUABLY NOT ENOUGH IT IS THE BEGINNING OF A DISCUSSION THAT WE CAN HAVE AS WE PROGRESS FORWARD AND WE ARE SUPPORTIVE OF THAT EFFORT. US FOR OUR HOUSING PROJECT IS WHICH IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT IT IS A- A MAJOR NEXT STEP IN OUR ECONOMIC BILLS CONCEPT WHERE WE- PROVIDE- OF. HOUSING ACADEMIC SUPPORT FACILITIES CAMPUS AMENITIES FOR STUDENTS FROM MULTIPLE INSTITUTIONS- CURRENTLY WE'RE DEVELOPING A PROJECT THAT WILL HOUSE TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY UCSF STUDENTS UC DAVIS STUDENTS. WE'VE HAD DISCUSSIONS WITH UC BERKELEY AS- POTENTIALLY BEING OF AN ELEMENT OF THE SOLUTION FOR THEIR PROBLEMS. THE PROJECT AT HAND IS A NINETEEN TWENTY NINE ERROR BUILDING THAT IS IN NEED A SEISMIC. STRENGTHENING IT IS MIXED UE OF THE- A NINETY MILLION DOLLARS WILL BE. GRANTED STILL PROVIDE PROOF THE DIFFERENTLY BELOW MARKET RENTS- IN THIS AUDIENCE ARE OUR POPULATION IS GRADUATE AND PROFESSIONAL SCHOOL STUDENTS.

AND YOU CAN SEE ON SORT OF THE BOTTOM LINE TOTAL THERE THOUGH TOTAL MAYOR VISION CHANGE HERE IS. UNDER FIVE MILLION DOLLARS SO THESE ARE AMONG YOURS SMALLER SMALLER- PROPOSALS IN TERMS OF DOLLAR AMOUNTS. WE'RE STILL WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION TO OBTAIN INFORMATION ON THESE PROPOSALS WE RECENTLY GOT SOME INFORMATION THIS MORNING SOURCE STILL CURRENTLY REVIEWING THAT INFORMATION PLAN ON SUBMITTING- OUR COMMENTS- WE'RE SPECIFICALLY TO STAFF IN THE- VERY SOON. THANK YOU STATE LIBRARY. GREG LUCAS FROM THE STATE LIBRARY CHEN AND JASON HAVE DESCRIBED WHAT'S IN THE GOVERNOR'S MY REVISION. THERE'S NOTHING I CAN REALLY ADD TO THAT. OKAY THANK YOU WE THINK THESE PROPOSALS- SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES I DON'T HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ON THESE- THE CITY FROM THE OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS WILL. HOLD THIS OPEN AND PROCEED NOW TO PUBLIC COMMENT WHAT WE ARE NOT GOING TO HEAR THE SCHOLARS SHARE ITEM WILL JUST VOTE ON THAT WITH OUR PACKAGE NEXT WEEK QUESTION YES AND THEN ALSO THE VOTE ONLY ISSUES WHAT WE WANT TO DO THAT TODAY WE'LL DO THAT NEXT TIME. YOU HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE LIBRARY DR CHOI. YEAH AMONG US CATEGORIES OF- OF FUNDING- FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IS- AS FOR. LEARN AT THE LIVE PRO. I WONDER WHY- LIBRARY HAS TO GO INTO LUNCH PROGRAM SO WHAT IS THIS FOR A YOUR PROGRAM SO YOU ARE. WE IS JUST SELF FEEDING SOME PAPER HUNGRY- THE I MEAN THERE ARE SO MANY AGENCIES SO WE'LL TAKE CARE OF- LUNCH PROGRAMS BUT- I NEVER HEARD ABOUT THE LIBRARY PROVIDING LUNCH. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION I GENERALLY WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- THE ADMINISTRATION HAS PROVIDED A WITH THE SUPPORT THE LEGISLATURE HAS PROVIDE PASS AUGMENTATIONS. SUMMER PROGRAMS WHICH TYPICALLY- MOST A LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES DO NOT PROVIDE LUNCHES DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS WHERE SCHOOL IS DURING OFF SEASON AND SO DO PREFER TO PROVIDE THOSE ADDITIONAL SERVICES TO CHILDREN AND UNDERSERVED AND LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES- THE ADMINISTRATION. AND THE LEGISLATURE HAS JOINTLY AS SUPPORTED THESE ACTIVITIES TO- HELP FEED AND- FAMILIES- AND HIGH NEED IN LOW INCOME AND UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES- AS PART OF A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT WITH THE LOCAL COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES. SO BASICALLY- JUST PROVIDING LUNCH DURING THE PROGRAM THAT THE WEST DURING THE CELL WHILE WE HAVE A LAB. USES CON- JUST A FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF NOT. NOT FOR THE FEEDING PURPOSES BUT THE FOR THE PROGRAM PURPOSES IS THAT WHAT I LOVE SEVEN. I WILL DEFER TO THE STATE LIBRARIAN FOR SPECIFICS ON LOCATIONS WELL IT'S NOT FOR CONVENIENCE RIGHT. IN THE SUMMERTIME IT'S THE FEDERAL LUNCH PROGRAM THAT WORKS IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS DURING THE SCHOOL YEAR THE SCHOOLS CLOSED THEY HAND THE BATON THE LIBRARIES IN THE SUMMER EVEN WITH LIBRARIES DOING THIS IN ABOUT TWO HUNDRED- AND EIGHTY FIVE OR MORE LIBRARIES SERVE THESE MAILS ABOUT THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND EACH SUMMER. EVEN WITH THEM DOING THAT OF THE TWO POINT EIGHT MILLION KIDS IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS RIGHT WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR THESE LUNCH IS ONLY 10% OF THOSE KIDS GET A MEAL IN THE SUMMER. SO WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE AT THE LIBRARIES IS IN ADDITION TO ALL THESE OTHER AGENCIES YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT I MEAN WE'RE STILL ONLY REACHING 10% OF THE KIDS WHAT LIBRARIES BRING TO THEM TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW ALREADY OF COURSE WHAT LIBRARIES BRING TO IT IS. THE IN RICHMOND AND THE SUMMER READING PROGRAMS I'VE BEEN TO THESE THINGS THE KIDS COME OUT OF THE OF THE LUNCH PLACE WHERE THEY HAVE A MEAL. AND TO A PERSON THEY ASKED WHERE DO WE SIGN UP FOR SUMMER READING. SO LIBRARIES OFFER TO FOR YOU KNOW OVER TIME THREE FOR RECEIVING A FOR RIGHT WITH ALL THE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT THEY PROVIDE ONE OF THE MISSING PIECES THOUGH IF I MAY. IS THE FEDERAL PROGRAM ONLY PROVIDES MEALS FOR KIDS AND THE VERY RIGID ABOUT THAT SO HUNGRY FAMILIES COME TO THE LIBRARY FOR A MEAL IN THE SUMMERTIME RIGHT AND THE PARENTS GET SET OFF SOMEWHERE ELSE RIGHT WELL THE KIDS GET A MEAL. AND SO THERE'S A THERE'S A BROADER ISSUE WITH THESE FEDERAL WAIVERS RIGHT THAT THAT THEY PUT IN PLACE DIFFERENT RULES TO FACILITATE HANDING OUT THESE LUNCHES DURING THE PANDEMIC. AND SO THERE'S. WIDE SPREAD SUPPORT FOR KEEPING THE SPENT WAIVER AND- TO FIX- SERVING THESE MAIL OF THE SOME. SO IT ISN'T IT ISN'T SOMETHING THAT LIBRARIES ARE BEING FORCED TO DO IT BEGAN AS US WEST WITH SEVENTEEN LIBRARIES WHO WANTED TO DO IT. AND WITH THIS HELP WE'VE EXPANDED IT TO TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE LIKE I SAY EVEN DURING THE PANDEMIC WHEN THE PHYSICAL DOORS WERE CLOSED THE CREATIVITY OF LIBRARIES ALLOW THEM TO SERVE THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND MEALS N THAT SUMMER OF THAT BE TWENTY TWENTY. YEAH DID I ANSWER YOUR QUESTION YES SOUNDS SOUNDS LIKE A LIBRARY SO I HAVE IS A STEPPED UP. WHEN THE SCHOOL IS UP CLOSE IT IS SPECIALLY DURING THE SUMMERTIME YEAH WELL THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT WORK RIGHT IS- IS FORGING THESE KIND OF RELATIONSHIPS AND PARTNERSHIPS WITH THE SCHOOLS RIGHT SO THAT LIKE THE BATON GETS HANDED OFF. YOU KNOW AND EASY WAY CAN OFTEN OFTEN SOMETIMES THE SCHOOL CAFETERIAS IN THOSE FACILITIES WILL STILL BE USED FOR THAT KIND OF MEAL STORAGE AND PREPARATION. OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION. OKAY THANK YOU WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN AND- INCLUDE THE HEARING IT PROCEED NOW PUBLIC COMMENTS SO PLEASE KEEP YOUR COMMENTS TO ONE MINUTE OR LESS.
