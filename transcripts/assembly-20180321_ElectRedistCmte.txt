THE MEANING OF THE ELECTIONS AND REDISTRICTING COMMITTEE. WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD AND GET STARTED. AS A SUB COMMITTEE. MADAM SECRETARY WILL YOU PLEASE CALL RECALL ROLE WE DON'T CALDERON. CARRILLO CALDERON THOUGH WE HAVE WARM LITTLE RUSTY. THE FIRST ELECTIONS AND REDISTRICTING COMMITTEE HEARING OF THE YEAR. NOT INCLUDING THE JOINT COMMITTEE THAT WE HAD A COUPLE WEEKS AGO. BEFORE WE BEGIN I HAVE A HOUSEKEEPING ANNOUNCEMENT TO MAKE A. B. EIGHTEEN EIGHTY SIX CARILLO HAS BEEN PULLED FROM THE CONSENT CALENDAR SO BE HEARD. AT OUR HEARING TODAY. AND I THINK. IT WILL BE HEARD FIRST AT OUR HEARING TODAY. SOURCE ON THE NUMBER CARILLO IF YOU'D LIKE TO COME PRESENT YOUR BILL GOOD MORNING MORNING. THE THING ON ERICA. GOOD MORNING UP MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I AM HERE TO PERCENT AB EIGHTEEN EIGHTY SIXTH A BILL TO HELP CONDUCT SPECIAL ELECTIONS FAIRLY. ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING THE RECENT US US BASE OF VACANCY. CURRENT LAW REQUIRES THAT ANY VACANCY IN THE ASSEMBLY SENATE OR CONGRESSIONAL SEAT BE FILLED BY A SPECIAL PRIMARY ELECTION. AND IF NEEDED A SPECIAL GENERAL ELECTION IT CURRENTLY FALLS ON OUR COUNTIES TO PAY ALL EXPENSES TO PREPARE FOR AND CONDUCT THE SPECIAL ELECTIONS. THE STATE RARELY PROVIDE FUNDING FOR THESE ELECTIONS AND A. B. EIGHTEEN EIGHTY SIX WILL TAKE THE FIRST STEP IN ADDRESSING THESE CONCERNS BY LIFTING THE COSTLY BURDEN. OF STATE AND FEDERAL SPECIAL ELECTIONS AND SHIFTING THEM TO THE STATE. THIS BILL IS SUPPORTED BY URBAN AND RURAL COUNTIES ACROSS OUR STATE AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR. SUPPORT AND AB. AT EIGHTEEN AND EIGHTY SIX WITH ME HERE TO TESTIFY IS THE LOGIN THE REGISTER RECORD COUNTY CLERK FROM LA COUNTY. MORNING GOOD MORNING. CHAIRMAN BERMAN MEMBERS COMMITTEE THINK YOU CAPTAIN SPEAK AND BE IN LOVE AND I'M REGISTER RECORDER COUNTY CLERK FOR LOS ANGELES COUNTY AND I MUST SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION A QUICK SELECTION OFFICIALS WHO ALSO SUPPORT THIS BILL. WHEN I THINK ASSEMBLY MEMBER CARILLO FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND FOR A TIME FOR. BRING AWARENESS TO INITIATIVE THAT WE WOULD THINK ABOUT LA COUNTY ON A REGULAR BASIS AND THAT IS THE THE COST OF SPECIAL VACANCY ELECTIONS IN LA COUNTY. AS I'VE PROVIDED ON THE. ATTACHED TO MY TESTIMONY WE HAVE CONDUCTED. IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS. FIFTEEN SPECIAL ELECTIONS FROM TWENTY THIRTEEN TO TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND NOW NINE SPECIAL ELECTIONS. IN THIS YEAR ALONE ALREADY WE'RE JUST A FEW MONTHS INTO INTO THE YEAR AND SO THAT THE CUMULATIVE COST OF THAT FOR THAT LA COUNTY HAS MORNING. APPROACHES OR AN AND MAY EXCEED TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS THAT'S MONEY THAT THAT GETS PULLED AWAY FROM. OTHER COUNTY SERVICES AND PRIORITIES. IT'S IT'S AND BUDGETED MONEY AND IT ALSO PULLS AWAY FROM ELECTIONS PERSPECTIVE RESOURCES THAT WE NEED TO BE WORKING ON THE MODERNIZATION OF OUR VOTING SYSTEMS AND DOING VOTER OUTREACH AND EDUCATION. I'M SO WE KNOW THAT THE LEGISLATURE IN THE PAST HAS PROVIDED SOME REIMBURSEMENT FOR SPECIAL ELECTION COSTS. AND WHILE THAT WAS ALL THAT WAS BETTER THAN THE SITUATION TODAY EVEN THE PREVIOUS MODEL WAS BASED ON A FORMULA THAT DID NOT COVER THE FULL ACTUAL COST OF CONDUCTING THOSE ELECTIONS ON SO. I WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS BILL AND ASK YOUR CONSIDERATION AND YOUR SUPPORT AS WE MOVE FORWARD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. SIR CHAIR MEMBERS JEAN HURST HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE COUNTIES OF RIVERSIDE SANTA CLARA SANTA CRUZ VENTURA AND THE RURAL COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIA ALL IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU.

THAT'S CORRECT THOUGH I AM THE PERSON A BILL FOR FIFTEEN THAT PASSED. TWO YEARS AGO AND THE THE CITIES AND LOCAL DISTRICTS HAVE ENTAILED TWENTY TWENTY TWO TO ALIGN WITH THE AT THE STATE ELECTION CYCLE MOST CITIES AND SPECIAL DISTRICTS IN LA COUNTY HAVE ALREADY. I'M TAKEN THAT THE PROCEDURAL PASSED THE RESOLUTIONS TO DO THAT THE MAJORITY OF THOSE WILL. MANY OF US LIKELY START TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND AND THE MAJORITY OF THEM WILL ALREADY BE DONE BY TWENTY TWENTY. THANK YOU BUT JUST A BRIEF COMMENT DOES WHAT ONE OF THINGS THAT I'VE OBSERVED OVER LAST A COUPLE OF DECADES IS THAT. BEFORE THE MOST RECENT SPATE OF. OF RESIGNATIONS IN SUCH TYPICALLY A SIGNIFICANT PART OF VACANCIES IN THE LEAD STATE LEGISLATURE WERE OFTEN BECAUSE THE LOS ANGELES CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS WOULD RUN. FOR SIMPLY ASSEMBLY MEMBERS IN LOS ANGELES RUN FOR CITY COUNCIL BECAUSE THE STAGGERED ELECTIONS IT OFTEN BECAUSE VACANCY BUT WITH THAT. WILL HAVE PROBABLY REDUCED POOL I THINK OF. OF FOLKS WERE THE SPECIAL ELECTIONS I DO INDEED HAPPEN. WHETHER IT'S BY DEATH WHETHER ESPY RESIGNATION WHETHER SPOT FOR OTHER MEANS. I'M A VERY STRONG SUPPORTER OF THE SPECIAL ELECTION AS THE A DECIDER OF. WHO GETS? TO SUCCEED IN ANY VACANCY SITUATION RATHER THAN SOME KIND OF APPOINTMENT UP OR OTHER SYSTEM SO I'M VERY VERY HAPPY. TO SEE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FROM A LOS ANGELES INTRODUCED SIDE THIS BILL I THINK IT'S A LONG TIME COMING IT'S WHAT WE USED TO DO. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE STATE USE TO TAKE CARE OF THE COSTS. A LOT OF ITS ELECTION SYSTEMS BUT THE STATE START CUTTING CORNERS BY ITS SOME POINT. I IN I THINK THAT THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT STEP BUT TOWARDS THE RESTORATION OF THE DEMOCRACY IN THE STATE.

PREFERABLY THE EASIER ONE OF THE TWO. ABILITY. YES THEY ARE. YEAH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IF. ALLOW ME THEN TO PRESENT A. B. NINETEEN FORTY SEVEN. THE PROHIBITION OF PAYMENTS PER SIGNATURE. AB NINETEEN FORTY SEVEN WILL MAINTAIN THE INTEGRITY OF OUR INITIATIVE PROCESS BY ELIMINATING. THE BILL THE OF SIGNATURE GATHERS TO SEE PAYMENT PER SIGNATURE. THE NEED TO COLLECT HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF SIGNATURES WITHIN THE LIMITED TIME FOR HAS RESULTED IN THE CREATION OF. PETITION MANAGEMENT FIRMS WHICH GOES AGAINST THE FUNDAMENTAL. BASIS OF OUR DEMOCRACY. AT THIS BILL WILL HELP MAINTAIN THAT WE CONTINUE TO. INVEST IN THE SPIRIT OF OUR. DIRECT DEMOCRACY PROCESS AND TO BE CLEAR OF THIS BILL SIMPLY. A ALLOWS THAT SIGNATURE GATHERERS CAN BE PAID HOURLY OR BY STIPEND BY STIPEND RATHER THAN JUST SIMPLY. ENCOURAGING THAT OF THE SIGNATURE THEMSELVES. AT TODAY WITH ME IS. SPEAKING IN SUPPORT WITH THE CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS. YOU'RE CAN THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN BURST MAY CONSUMERS HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS WERE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. I'M YOU KNOW THE INITIATIVE PROCESS WITH CREATED BY THE PEOPLE FOR THE PEOPLE AND IT WAS THE AWAY FORCE REGULAR CITIZENS TO AFFECT CHANGE IF THEY FELT LIKE THERE LAWMAKERS WORK DOING IT FOR THEM. AND AT THE TIME SIGNATURE GATHERING WAS ALMOST UNIVERSALLY UNPAID COMPLETELY. AND SO REALLY YOU KNOW THIS THIS MEASURE SEEKS TO RESTORE HOW THE PROCESS WAS INTENDED AND THE LACK OF QUALIFYING A BALLOT MEASURE IN THE PAST WAS JUST A SIGN THAT THIS. MAYBE DIDN'T HAVE THE GRASSROOTS SUPPORT NEEDED TO EFFECT THATCHANGE SO WHAT WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO DO HERE IS JUST GET BACK TO THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF THAT CALIFORNIA'S BALLOT INITIATIVE PROCESS. WERE NOT ELIMINATING PAYMENT FOR SIGNATURE GATHERING COMPLETELY AS THE AUTHOR STATED JUST REALLY TRYING TO. RESTORE FAIRNESS INTO THE PROCESS AND AND SO WE ARE IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. I INGRAM OF THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA WE DON'T HAVE A FORMAL POSITION ON THE BILL WE'VE SHARED OUR CONCERNS WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE IN SOME LANGUAGE AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MEMBERS MY NAME'S LURKER TEST NAME HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY WHILE WE BELIEVE IN UPHOLDING THE INTEGRITY OF THE INITIATIVE PROCESS. THIS BILL WILL DENY CALIFORNIANS THE RIGHT TO DIRECT DEMOCRACY WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER HAD SOME ISSUES WITH AND FEELING THAT THE SIGNATURE GATHERERS WERE LITTLE TOO AGGRESSIVE. HOW AND IT APPEARS THAT THE GOAL OF AB NINETEEN FORTY SEVEN IS ALSO TO ADDRESS VOTER REGISTRATION FRAUD HOWEVER THIS BILL WILL NOT REMEDY THOSE ISSUES WALTZ A WORTHY GOAL AB NINETEEN FORTY SEVEN? WILL HAVE THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE OF LIMITING THE PUBLIC'S PARTICIPATION AND ABOUT PROCESS. IN BY OUTLINE PAYMENT FOR SIGNATURE ON A PER SIGNATURE BASIS THIS BILL WILL BE MOM CREATE A PROHIBITIVELY EXPENSIVE PROCESS WHEREBY MAKING IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR RECALLS AND INITIATIVES AND POTENTIALLY ON AND I'M AND. IMPOSSIBLE TO DO A REFERENDUM IN ADDITION THERE'S NO COMPELLING EVIDENCE THAT THERE'S ACTUALLY RAMPANT FRAUD WITH THIS PAYMENT PROCESS THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S ELECTION FRAUD INVESTIGATION UNIT OPENED TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY CASES OVER A DECADE AND A HALF FROM NINETEEN NINETY FOUR TO TWO THOUSAND TEN. WITH THAT THERE WERE ONLY THIRTY THREE CONVICTIONS THERE ARE ALSO HUNDREDS OF INITIATIVES PLACED ON BALLOTS REQUIRING MILLIONS OF SIGNATURES SO FOR OVER A DECADE HALF THEIR ONLY THIRTY THREE CONVICTIONS WITH A MILLION SIGNATURE WITH MILLIONS OF SIGNATURES REQUIRED. THE CURRENT PROCESS IS A CHECK AND BALANCE ON GOVERNMENT BY MAKING IT HARDER TO QUALIFY BALLOT MEASURES YOU ARE DENYING CALIFORNIANS OPPORTUNITY EXPRESS GRIEVANCES DIRECTLY WITH THEIR GOVERNMENT THROUGH INITIATIVE. MET AND BALLOTS AND REFERENDUMS WE UNDERSTAND THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS GOALS AND WHILE WE AT WHILE WE BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE WELL INTENTIONED W LOOK FORWARD TO FINDING ALTERNATIVE METHOD TO GET TO THOSE SCHOOLS. THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS GOOD MORNING DAVID WOLF WITH THAT HOWARD JARVIS TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION OPPOSED. TAVY NINETEEN FORTY SEVEN TODAY. MEMBERS IT'S WORTH NOTING FIRST OF ALL THAT THE SAME BILL WAS TRIED IN TWENTY ELEVEN. BY SENATOR CORBETT AND WAS VETOED BY GOVERNOR BROWN AND YOU HAVE THE EXACT SAME BILL IS BEFORE US TODAY IS HOW WE JUST THROW THAT OUT IS POINT NUMBER ONE. I'M. LISTEN MEMBERS IS THERE AN OVERRELIANCE ON PAID SIGNATURE GATHERERS AND OUR INITIATIVE PROCESS. PERHAPS RIGHT DO WE DO WE WISH THAT THERE WAS LESS RELIANCE ON PAID SIGNATURE GATHERERS TO QUALIFY INITIATIVES SURE. BUT THERE'S CERTAIN WAYS TO GO ABOUT DOING THAT RIGHT WE CAN. FOR EXAMPLE AND THIS IS SOMETHING I NOTE IN OUR LETTER WE CAN INCREASED THE AMOUNT OF TIME YOU TO GATHER SIGNATURES. THAT WOULD BE GREAT WE CAN GO OUT AND TARGET OUR MEMBERS WITH PETITIONS WITH TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND MEMBERS UP AND DOWN THE STATE. AND WE CAN DO THAT AND WE DON'T NEED PAID SIGNATURE GATHERERS OR AT LEAST A DECREASED ALLIANCE ON THE QUALIFY INITIATIVES THAT WOULD BE GREAT BUT THIS BILL DOESN'T DO THAT. THIS BILL HAS MAJOR AND MASSIVE FIRST AMENDMENT ISSUES. WE SHOULDN'T BE PUNISHING PEOPLE WHO ENGAGE IN A FREE MARKET CONTRACT TO ENGAGE IN A GOOD. THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE OUT THERE GATHERING SIGNATURES IN BEING PAID FOR THAT WHAT'S THE PROBLEM WITH THAT. AND YOU KNOW TO QUALIFY CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT RIGHT NOW TO BE SAFE YOU LETTER WE NEED TO GATHER A MILLION SIGNATURES HOW WILL THAT HAPPEN. WITHOUT PAID SIGNATURE GATHERERS. ESPECIALLY IN THE SIX MONTHS NEEDED THE QUALIFYING INITIATIVE THERE ARE WAYS TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM AND DECREASE OUR ALLIANCE UNPAID SIGNATURE GATHERERS BUT THIS BILL IS NOT THE WAY TO DO IT AND ASK FOR ANOTHER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NINE OPENING UP THE COLLEAGUES FOR ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS THEY HAVE. MISS HARPER. HELLO. POINTED OUT DOWN. IT IS HAVE PREVIOUSLY POINTED OUT TO US. GOVERNOR BROWN NOT VETOED A BILL ON MUCH LIKE THIS JUST A FEW YEARS AGO HE STATED THE BILL WAS FLAWED BECAUSE IT WOULD EFFECTIVELY PROHIBIT ORGANIZATIONS FROM SETTING TARGETS OR QUOTAS. UP FOR THOSE WHO HAVE A. THEY HIRE AYE TO GATHER SIGNATURES THEREBY MAKING THE PRODUCTIVITY. GOALS A CRIME I IN THAT WOULD INDEED DRIVE UP THE COST OF CIRCLING BALLOT MEASURES THERE BY FAVORING THE WEALTHY STE. ARE OF SPECIAL INTEREST WATER YOUR COMMENTS IN REGARDS TO TO. THAT POINT THAT WAS BROUGHT UP. RUNS AND SO WHAT POINT THAT WAS. WHICH POINT I REFERRING TO WHAT THAT THE GOVERNOR HAD INDEED VETOED. I. BUILT IT WAS A SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR TO THIS ONE AND THAT DIED BY PROHIBITING ORGANIZATIONS FROM SETTING TARGETS QUOTAS. FOR SIGNATURE GATHERERS ON MAKING THE PRODUCTIVITY OF FOLKS WHO ARE HELPING WITH THE SIGNATURE DRIVE. UP THAT YOU'RE AFFECTED LEE DRIVING UP THE COST SO MUCH THAT ONLY THAT THE WEALTHIEST OF SPECIAL INTERESTS CAN INDEED ENGAGE AYE IN TRYING TO QUALIFY A BALLOT MEASURE. AS THE BILL. IT IS WRITTEN THE THIS IS NOT PROHIBITS PAID SIGNATURE GATHERERS. IT SIMPLY REDUCES THE. RELIANCE ON SUCH A HOSTILE. IN WHICH I HAVE OBSERVED WHEN I WAS ATTRADER JOE'S IN WHICH IN A SINGER GATHER SAID PLEASE SIGN THIS PETITION. AND THEN RIGHT BEHIND THAT ONE PETITION THIS INDIVIDUAL ALSO HAVE THREE OTHER PETITIONS FOR OTHER OTHER OPPORTUNITIES. AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO. CHURCH TRIED TACKLE ENSURING THAT WE HAVE INTEGRITY IN OUR ELECTORAL PROCESS. THE COMMISSION CHAIR IF I COULD REFLECT ON NOT THAT. EXPERIENCE OF MANY OF MY PEERS ARE I KNOW THAT THERE ARE SOME FOLKS LIKE TO CHARACTERIZE NOT PAID SIGNATURE GATHERERS TO SAY. PEOPLE WHO ARE EXCLUSIVELY DURING THE SAYS THAT AS A PROFESSION AYE BUT APART MY EXPERIENCE I HIS BEEN THAT VERY OFTEN FOLKS WHO WERE EMPLOYED. AYE IS IS SIGNATURE GATHERERS IN THIS MATTER A ARE OFTEN YOUNG PEOPLE COLLEGE STUDENTS SECTOR WHO WOULD LOVE TO BE ABLE TO SPIN THE PUBLIC UP POLICY PROCESS. UP BUT THIS IS INDEED THE WAY OFFER THEM I TO BE ABLE TO DO IT TO BE ABLE TO. TO TO IMPORTANT THINGS EXCEPT FOR. I WOULD THINK THAT THIS. KIND OF A BILL WOULD A SUBSTANTIALLY GIVEN ADVANTAGE TO WELL MAYBE EXISTING. ONGOING POLITICAL ORGANIZATIONS SIZE SUCH AS A LABOR UNION SIX HATRA UP OR PEOPLE WHO WERE I ABLE TO AFFORD A VERY EXTENSIVE UP POLITICAL ONGOING NETWORK. IS A SPECIAL INTERESTS THEMSELVES AND I THINK THIS THIS REDUCES OF THE GRASSROOTS ASPECT. OF SIGNATURE GATHERING. I AND I LIKE. WAS BROUGHT UP AS WELL I THINK THAT THERE'S VERY SIGNIFICANT FIRST AMENDMENT CONCERNS AND I THINK IF THE SUB WOULD TO. IF THIS WERE TO WHAT PASSED THE LEGISLATURE AND BE SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR. WOULD BEACH PROBABLY STE BE STRUCK DOWN ON FIRST AMENDMENT CONCERNS AND THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME EXPRESS THOSE COMMENTS. THANK YOU MISS HARPER. IS WHAT MISTER CALDERON. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. I DON'T THINK IT'S A SECRET TO ANYBODY IN THIS BUILDING THAT THERE IS AN ISSUE WITH THE INITIATIVE PROCESSAND AND AND CALIFORNIA. IS DIRECT DEMOCRACY OF THAT AT THE SAME TIME YOU KNOW CONSTANTLY PASSES MEASURES THAT TIES THE HANDS OF THE LEGISLATURE. WHEN YOU'RE IF YOU ASK SOMEBODY TO BUILD YOUR HOUSE. AND YOU SEE HAVE TWO WEEKS TO DO IT. BEFORE WE LEAVE WE TO TIE ONE HAND BEHIND YOUR BACK AND TAKE AWAY ALL YOUR TOOLS TO DO IT. HE TO BE PRETTY UNABLE TO BE ABLE TO FIX THAT HOUSE TO BUILD A HOUSE IN THE TIME FRAME AYE LET ALONE DO IT ALL THAT ESSENTIALLY IS WHAT THE INITIATIVE PROCESS. A LOT OF TIMES DOES THE LEGISLATION BEING ABLE TO DO OUR JOB IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE WHICH IS WHAT WE WERE ELECTED TO DO. SO HAVE A LOT OF CONCERN JUST IN GENERAL WITH THIS IDEA OF DIRECT DEMOCRACY AND ITS ACTUAL AFFECT ON DEMOCRACY IN OUR ABILITY TO DO OUR JOBS LEGISLATIVE BODY. YOU KNOW TO SAY THAT THIS MEASURE WOULD ONLY BECAUSE. I'VE THIS PROCESS TO BE OPEN ARE TO THE MOST WEALTHY OF PEOPLE TO RUN INITIATIVES WELL THAT'S WHAT IT IS NOW. ALTHOUGH HOW MUCH MONEY DOES IT TAKE TO ACTUALLY RUN A CAMPAIGN TO GATHER FIVE HUNDRED PLUS THOUSAND SIGNATURES TAKES A LOT OF MONEY AND THE SIGNATURE GATHERERS THEIR DIFFERENT RATES OF WHICH THEY CAN GET THEY CAN GET PAID THE SUCCESS IS HOW MUCH MONEY YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE. TO PUSH THAT WE HAVE PEOPLE ALL THE TIME FROM OUTSIDE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA RUN INITIATIVES AND HAVE THE MONEY TO DO IT AND AFFECTING STATE POLICY TELLING OUR VOTERS THIS IS GREAT FOR YOU. PASS THIS WHILE AT THE SAME TIME IS GREW THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BECAUSE THEY DON'T CARE THEY CARE ABOUT THEIR BOTTOM DOLLAR THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT WHAT IT ACTUALLY. IS THE FACT IN CALIFORNIA IN WHITTIER I WANT TO TARGET. THOSE THREATS RIGHT DOWN THE STREET FROM OUR HOUSE. SIGNATURE GATHERS OF COURSE MULTIPLE PETITIONS TO SIGN RIGHT THERE IN A BIG WHITE BOARD SAYS. STOP THE LEGISLATURE FROM RAISING YOUR TAXES REQUIRING THEM TO HAVE A TWO THIRDS VOTE PASS ANY TAX. THAT LAW ALREADY EXISTS. THAT'S A LIE. BUT YET IT'S GREAT TALKING POINT TRYING GATHER A SIGNATURE. BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER WE HAVE IN THE SENATE ONE OF OUR COLLEAGUES OR SOMEONE FROM OUTSIDE OF HIS DISTRICT. IT'S COMING IN. PUSHING OF INITIATIVE ARE TO HAVE A FOR RECALL THEY QUALIFIED THAT RECALL AND AGAIN A LOT OF THE CONCERNS FROM WHAT WE'VE BEEN HEARING. IS THAT. REPEAL THE GAS TAX BUT ESSENTIALLY WAS A. IT NOT. OBVIOUSLY TO REPEAL THE GAS TAX IT WAS TO SIGN A PETITION TO CALL FOR RECALL ON THE SEA SENATOR. AND SO. YOU KNOW I I. IT AN AND AGAIN YOU KNOW JUST BECAUSE THE GOVERNOR VETOED THE BILL DOESN'T MEAN IT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON AN ISSUE LIKE THIS HOUSE TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN IT SEVEN YEARS AGO. I RAN THE SAME BILL TWO YEARS IN A ROW FOR YOUR GOT AT A VETO. ON RIGHT TO TRY THE SECOND YEAR YOU SIGNED IT SO ARE AND I THINK THE CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH THE GOVERNOR VETOED THE BILL THE FIRST TIME AROUND VERSUS THE CIRCUMSTANCES TODAY WHAT WE ARE SEEING MORE ISSUES WITH THE. WITH THE INITIATIVE PROCESS AND THE PEOPLE THAT ARE COMING INTO OUR STATE OR THAT ARE ALREADY IN OUR STATE WE THINK ABOUT THE HOUSING ISSUES AND THE END OF IN THE INITIATIVES ARE BEING PUSHED BY INDIVIDUALS IN THE LA COUNTY. TO KEEP THEIR VIEW FROM BEING BLOCKING SOLIS THAT'S THAT'S BUT RUN A STATEWIDE INITIATIVE I'M MILLIONAIRE I GOT A LINE MONEY SO I DON'T WANT MY VIEW OBSTRUCTED SOMEONE WHY PASS INITIATIVES THAT YOU CAN BUILD ANYTHING YET WE HAVE AN AFFORDABLE. HOUSING CRISIS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT WAS THEY GOT DEFEATED. BUT STILL QUALIFY BECAUSE HE HAD THE MONEY TO GET THE SIGNATURE SO THERE'S A REALLY BIG ISSUE NO HUGE DISCONNECT. ARE AND WHEN YOU WHEN YOU ARE YOU KNOW SIGNATURE FARMING AND YOU'RE GETTING PAID PER SIGNATURE THERE'S THAT. THERE'S AN AUTOMATIC A DESIRE TO GET AS MANY SIGNATURES. HOWEVER YOU POSSIBLY CAN BECAUSE THAT'S ARE GETTING PIC IS I AGREE WITH THE VICE CHAIR STATEMENT. THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE DOING THIS BECAUSE THEY NEED THE MONEY AND I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH THAT AND I THINK THERE'S NOBODY BETTER MONEY TO TAKING ESPECIALLY HELP YOU SURVIVE IN THIS KIND OF MONEY. BUT. I THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THAT'S THE BEST THAT'S THE BEST POLICY THE BEST PRACTICE. FOR. DEMOCRACY AND THIS KIND OF DIVIDE DIRECT DEMOCRACY THE INITIATIVE PROCESS AND SAVE CALIFORNIA. SO YOU KNOW I THINK THAT THE THE AUTHOR UNDERSTANDS THAT YOU KNOW THERE'S MORE WORK BUT HE'S GONNA BE DOING ON THIS BILL AND I THINK IT WOULD BE A DISSERVICE. TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THIS BILLS TENURE RIGHT HERE IT'S TO KEEP IT GOING ON CITY KEEP THE CONVERSATION GOING AND I AND I FULLY EXPECT THE HOWARD JARVIS TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION A CALVET HIM COMMERCE THING GIVES IN THE CONVERSATION. ARE BECAUSE THEY WERE ALL CALIFORNIANS WE REALLY NEED TO BE MORE ON THE SAME PAGE ARE NOT JUST IN THIS STATE. ABA NATIONALLY IT'S ALL FOR THE GREATER GOOD BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO TAKE MORE CONTROL OVER WHO HAS THE MONEY AND IS PUTTING. ADMISSION IS ON THE BALLOT THAT ARE AFFECTING EVERY SINGLE ONE OF US SO. AND MOVE THE BILL IN TO BE VOTING YES AND THANK YOU MR LAFFER BRING THE BILL FOR. THE MISTER CALDERON. MS BUT. IS WEBER YEAH RIVER THANK YOU. THANKS FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD OBVIOUSLY SPARKED QUITE A BIT OF CONVERSATION. AND I WILL PROBABLY VOTE TO MOVE BEFORE BUT NO GUARANTEE THAT APPLE FOR ON THE FLOOR. MY CONCERN IS THAT MUCH OF THE ARGUMENTS THAT EVERYONE IS REYES IS ABSOLUTELY CORRECT IN TERMS OF THE FLAWS OF OUR. OUR OUR SYSTEM ITSELF THE PETITIONS THE THE ISSUES OF PEOPLE NOT TELLING THE TRUTH SOME FOLKS HAVE SEVERAL. OF PETITIONS AND I'VE BEEN THERE TO SEE THE MALL WITH A ROLL THEM OUT TO YOU AND I DON'T DO THEM. AND THERE'S ALWAYS THERE'S A LOT OF THAT I'M NOT SURE OF THIS BILL SOLVES THAT PROBLEM THAT'S MY CONCERN IS THAT IF I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT THE FLAWS IN THE IN THE WHOLE SYSTEM OF PETITIONS. AND THOSE KINDS OF THINGS I'M NOT SURE IF IF IF SAYING YOU CAN'T BE INCENTIVIZE TO COLLECT BASED ON THE NUMBER OF. SIGNATURES YOU GET. BUT WE CAN PAY BY THE HOUR TO DO IT. I AM NOT SURE IF IF THAT SOLVES MY PROBLEM. BECAUSE IF THE PETITION THE SITUATION STILL EXISTS PROBABLY THOSE WHO HAVE THE ABILITY TO PAY PEOPLE BY THE HOUR. A WHICH IS QUITE A BIT OF MONEY. WOULD PROBABLY DO THAT. AND WOOD STILL IN THAT WITH ALL THESE THINGS TAKING PLACE ALL YOU HIRE PEOPLE WHO ARE MORE AGGRESSIVE ABOUT IT BECAUSE WHY YOU PAYING ABOUT OUR MEGA COMPETE TO BE THE PERSON THAT YOU PAY BY THE HOUR. WHO MAKES IS A DECENT SALARY ARE COLLECTING SIGNATURES SO I'M NOT SURE THE SOLVE ANY OF THOSE PROBLEMS? ARE THEY MAY EXACERBATE THE PROBLEM WITH ANYTHING. BUT AND AND IT DOESN'T ADDRESS AT ALL ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE PETITION PROCESS SOME INTEGRITY IN THE PETITIONS OUT OF THE YEAR HOW THEY'RE ADVERTISED TO INDIVIDUALS WITH THE NOT THERE'S. NO THEY HAVE TO BE TRUTHFUL ABOUT IT THEY CAN MAYBE ONLY CURE ONE PETITION WHATEVER IT IS BUT I'M NOT SURE IF THIS SOLVES THE PROBLEM IT IT IT MAKES US FEEL BETTER. A BUT IT MAY MAKE THE WHOLE PROCESS BECOME MORE OF DIFFICULT AND AND NOT NECESSARILY VERY EFFECTIVE OF THERE NEEDS TO BE A CONVERSATION ABOUT THE WHOLE IDEA. OF THE OF THE CITIZEN PETITION WITHIN THAT THAT IS AN APPROPRIATE THING TO DO AND WHERE IT AND UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD EXIST. AND MAYBE THERE MAY BE MORE RESTRICTIONS OR SOMETHING PLACED ON THOSE WHO COME UP WITH WITH WITH THESE PETITIONS AND HOW THEY MARKETED IN ALL KINDS OF THINGS. BUT I'M NOT SURE OF THE SOLVE ANY OF THOSE PROBLEMS I THINK IT IT IT IT IT IT APPROACHES IT BUT IT REALLY DOESN'T SOLVE THE PROBLEM BECAUSE PEOPLE GENERALLY FIND A WAY AROUND IT. AND I THINK MOST FOLKS ARE SAYING THAT THAT THIS PROCESS WHILE IT HAD SOME INITIAL VALUE IN TERMS OF HELPING THE CITIZENS HAVE ENGAGEMENT. ANIME ALSO CALL AND IT AND THE PETITION PROCESS IS CALLED MANY PEOPLE NOT TO BE AS ENGAGED AS A SHOULD AS VOTERS IN TERMS OF VOTING FOLKS OUT OF OFFICE. WE DON'T THINK OF DOING A VERY GOOD JOB. THEY HAVE A TENDENCY ONE RIGHT THE LAWS THEMSELVES WHICH OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE A LOT MORE COMPLICATIONS THAN ANYTHING ELSE AND MOST OF THEM INTO BEING LITIGATED OVER AND OVER AGAIN. BECAUSE A POORLY WRITTEN. BUT I'M GONNA AYE I THINK THE CONVERSATION SHOULD GO FORWARD. I'M NOT SURE IF THIS IS. READY FOR PRIMETIME IN TERMS OF REALLY ANSWERED THE QUESTIONS OF THIS WHOLE PROCESS OF THE OF THE INITIATIVE BUT ALL SUPPORT IT NOW WITH THE HOPES OF FINDING THAT THERE'S A LOT MORE THAN THAT YOU GOING TO DO WITH THIS. THEN SIMPLY DO THIS RESTRICTION. THANK YOU DOCTOR WEBER. ANY ADDITIONAL. COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS LOOKING FOR A SECOND. ON THE MOTION FOR MISTER CALDERON. GIVE US TWO SECONDS THAT'S GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SO. WOULD YOU LIKE OPPORTUNITY TO CLOSE INSULA AT YOU YES THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATIONS AND TO SOME OF OUR WEBER. OF THE THEY RECOGNITION OF THAT. WHEN TALKING AND CHALLENGING THAT PETITION GATHER. IF THEY KNOW THAT YOU ARE NOT GOING TO SIGN OR THAT YOUR CHALLENGE THEM ON THIS ISSUE. TO WHICH I COUNT THEM THIS OKAY WILL JUST I'M NOT GONNA TALK TO ANYMORE AND THEY'RE GONNA GO TELL THE PERSON BECAUSE THEY'RE SO FOCUSED ON GETTING THAT SIGNATURE BECAUSE OF. THE INCENTIVE THERE WHEREAS IF THEY'RE PAID HOURLY THEN OR SPY STIPEND OR WHATEVER THE NOTION MIGHT BE THAT THEY ACTUALLY HAVE TO TALK TO YOU AND. TRY TO CONVINCE YOU ON THESE ISSUES WHETHER INCENTIVIZE BY SAYING OKAY BLAH I'M JUST GOING TO HAVE NOT EVEN PAY ATTENTION TO YOU BECAUSE. YOU NOT WORTH MY TIME I'M NOT GONNA TRY TO CONVINCE YOU WHERE SOMEONE SPENT SOMETIME TO GETTING SOME OTHER. AND INDUBITABLE NO OTHER PERSON IN DECEIVING AND AND DIFFERENT WAY. AND SO THAT THAT'S WHY I THINK THAT THERE'S THAT THE DISTINCTION AND THE NUANCE BETWEEN THAT OF NOT INCENTIVIZING. A AND USING IT BY EACH SIGNATURE AND THAT HUSTLE UP BECAUSE JUST AS MISTER CALDERON MENTIONED THAT IT WAS MY EXPERIENCE SIMILARLY OUT WITH THAT EXPERIENCE. AND THE PETITION GATHER NOT BEING FACTUAL NOT SPENDING THE TIME NECESSARY TO ENGAGE IN A THOUGHTFUL DIALOG TO WHICH THE PERSON EVEN SAID BUT WHAT WOULD YOU KNOW. BUT DID YOU KNOW YOU WEREN'T THERE WHEN ON THIS S. B. ONE VOTE. AND OF COURSE IT I JUST KIND OF LAUGHED AND SAID OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I STEPPED AWAY. AND WATCH THIS PERSON ENGAGE IN A COSTING. OTHER PEOPLE. A AND MISTER BERMAN'S DISTRICT AT THIS STORE. AND SAW THE SAME TYPE OF ACTIVITY. SO. THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT POSSIBILITIES TO TALK ABOUT THE CONVERSATIONS ON MAINTAINING THE INTEGRITY OF THE ELECTORAL PROCESS IN WITH RESPECT TO A DIRECT ROUTE DEMOCRACY. BOB THIS IS JUST ONE SUBMIT. AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK REVIVAL. THANK YOU MR LOW END AND THANK YOU FOR. DOING BUSINESS IN MY DISTRICT. WHICH I APPRECIATE. BUT AS I THINK IT'S BEEN A GREAT CONVERSATION. AND A LOT OF REALLY GOOD POINTS. THE. CLEARLY ARE DIRECT DEMOCRACY SYSTEM ARE INITIATIVE SYSTEM HAS BEEN CORRUPTED FROM ITS ORIGINAL INTENT. OF ALLOWING THAT PEOPLE TO GET AROUND IT SPECIAL MONEYED INTERESTS OUGHT TO HAVE A SAY. IN IN DEMOCRACY IN OUR GOVERNMENT IN CALIFORNIA AND AND NOW IT'S ONLY THE WEALTHY THAT CAN AFFORD TO UTILIZE A DIRECT DEMOCRACY SYSTEM. BUT TO GET THE VOTES THEY NEED AND. I THINK ALL OF US HAVE PROBABLY SEEN WHAT MR LOW DESCRIBED. IN TERMS OF. LIKE IT CHARACTERIZES THE HUSTLE. OF THE SIGNATURE GATHERERS THAT HAVE A HALF DOZEN OR MORE DIFFERENT PETITIONS. DO YOU KNOW IF YOU POKE DEBATE ALL THEY DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO GET SIGNATURES FOR. AND CLEARLY THEY'RE USING TALKING POINTS THAT THEY FOUND. I GET THEM. MOST SIGNATURE IS THE FASTEST NOT NECESSARILY TALKING POINTS THAT ACTUALLY ACCURATELY PORTRAY WHAT THE INITIATIVE WOULD DO. AND AND SO WE NEED TO FILE AS AS A DOCTOR WEBER SAID YOU KNOW WE NEED TO FIND WAYS TO IMPROVE THE SYSTEM. ARE ON THE WHOLE I THINK THIS IS A GOOD STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. I KNOW THAT. SOME ISSUES WERE RAISED AROUND THE LEGALITY OF IT AND I REALLY WANT ENCOURAGE EVERYBODY TO READ THE COMMITTEES ANALYSIS. FOR THIS BILL IT TOOK ME BACK TO LAW SCHOOL. AND I WANT TO TO COMMEND THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR ANALYSIS OF BUT IT CLEARLY SHOWS THAT INFINITE IN FEBRUARY OF TWO THOUSAND SIX THE NINTH CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS. RULED THAT AN ORGAN LAW THAT WAS VERY SIMILAR TO THIS LOT TODAY. THAT PROHIBITED PAYMENT ELECTORAL PETITION SIGNATURE GATHERERS. DID NOT IMPOSE A SEVERE BURDEN UNDER THE FIRST AMENDMENT. AND SO I COMMEND THE AUTHOR FOR FOR FOLLOWING. YOU KNOW WHAT THAT LAW WAS. QUITE CLOSELY I'M VERY CONFIDENT THAT THIS WOULD BE UP HELD BY THE NINTH CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS IT'S ALSO BEEN UPHELD BY MULTIPLE OTHER COURTS OF APPEALS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. SO I'M OF TOTALLY GONE OFF SCRIPT OF MY TALKING POINTS. BUT LAST YEAR I AUTHORED AB THIRTEEN SIXTY SEVEN TO ENSURE THAT THE PROPONENTS OF MEASURES CAN BE HELD LIABLE FOR ENCOURAGING MISCONDUCT BY THE PETITION CIRCULATORS. THE EMPLOYEE AND I THINK THIS BILL IS ANOTHER IMPORTANT STEP TOWARD IMPROVING THE INTEGRITY OF OUR INITIATIVE REFERENDUM AND RECALL PROCESS ON RECOMMENDING SUPPORT ON THIS BILL. MADAM SECRETARY WE PLEASE CALL THE ROLL LOCAL VOTE AND THE MOTION IS TO PASS AND REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS BERMAN AYE AYE. BERMAN AYE HARPER. HARPER NOW CALDERON. CALDERON AYE LOW AYE LOW AYE MULLIN. MULLIN AYE PATTERSON. WEBER. WEBER I. SO THAT'S OUT ON THE FIVE ONE VOTE WILL KEEP THE ROLE OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS THANK YOU MISTER LOWE WOULD LIKE TO. PRESENT AB TWENTY ONE SIXTY FIVE THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE CHAIR MEMBERS YOU'VE SEEN THIS BILL BEFORE. ELECTION DAY HOLIDAY. WE SAW A A HISTORIC LOW VOTER TURNOUT OF JUST TWENTY FIVE. PERCENT OF REGISTERED VOTERS WHO PARTICIPATED IN TWO THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN PRIMARY. THERE ARE CURRENTLY FOURTEEN OTHER STATES THAT HAVE ELECTION DAY AS A HOLIDAY. AND THE INTENT OF THIS IS TO. REMOVE AS MANY PERRANCE AS POSSIBLE TO PARTICIPATION. AND WITH ME AND SUPPORT IS BY INGRAM WITH THE ACLU. THANK. I INGRAM LEGISLATIVE ATTORNEY WITH THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA WHERE PLEASE TEAR TO SUPPORT THIS BILL BECAUSE IT REMOVES BARRIERS TO VOTING. CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO BE PLAGUED BY LOW ELECTION TURNOUT IN TWENTY SIXTEEN ACCORDING TO THE U. S. CENSUS CALIFORNIA RANKED FORTY FIRST AND ELIGIBLE VOTERS TURNING OUT AT THE POLLS. THIS. TURNOUT DISPARITY IS PARTICULARLY NOTICEABLE ALONG INCOME LINES ACCORDING TO THE US CENSUS ONLY HALF OF ELIGIBLE VOTERS WITH AN INCOME HOUSEHOLD OF TWENTY THOUSAND OR LESS VOTED IN TWENTY TWELVE. AND ONLY TWENTY FIVE PERCENT VOTED IN THE TWENTY TEN MID TERMS THIS IS IN CONTRAST WITH HOUSEHOLDS OF. HOUSEHOLD INCOMES OF OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS THEY TURNED OUT AT RATES OF EIGHTY AND SIXTY PERCENT RESPECTIVELY. THIS HELPS REMOVE BARRIERS FOR LOW INCOME VOTERS WHO OFTEN CITE WORK AND SCHOOL CONFLICTS AS THE PRIMARY REASON FOR NOT VOTING. WHILE STATE LAW DOES ALLOW CALIFORNIANS TO TAKE TWO HOURS OFF IN ORDER TO VOTE THIS TIME OFF IS OFTEN GIVEN AT THE BEGINNING OR END OF THE SHIFT. WHICH ALSO COINCIDES WITH THE LONGEST LINES OFTEN AT POLLING PLACES OBSERVING A STATE HOLIDAY WOULD HELP GET PEOPLE OUT TO VOTE AND WE HOPE CALIFORNIA WILL JOIN THE SIXTEEN OTHER STATES AND THE TERRITORY OF PORTO RICO AND ENACTING. SUCH A REFORM RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. MORNING MORNING RAIN CITY WHEREVER ON THE PACIFIC A PART OF CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE CHAIR. OF THIS IS BEEN OF ONE OF THE PARTS OF OUR PLATFORM FOR ALMOST FIFTY YEARS SO. BETTER COME AND SUPPORTED THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR. JOHN RIEGER SECRETARY. OF STATE CENTRAL COMMITTEE FOR PEACE AND FREEDOM PARTY IN URGING YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE ALL BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. MR ROBERT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ON CENTRAL POINT ON THIS IS THAT ITSELF ONLY FOR GOVERNING POLICE ON MY UNDERSTANDING OF STATE EMPLOYEES CITY EMPLOYEES SCHOOL DISTRICT SPECIAL DISTRICT SITE COUNTY SIX ATRA. LIKE ALL EMPLOYEES OUR ART VIS EMPLOYEES ABLE TO BE ABLE TO TAKE OFF TIME ON ELECTION DAY AS PER STATE LAW. TO BE ABLE TO VOTE ALREADY. BUT AND NOT THE ENTIRE DAY. THE ENTIRE DAY NOT. THE IS IS THE ASSERTION THAT IT WOULD TAKE THE ENTIRE DAY TO BE ABLE TO VOTE RENTS IN. THE CALL. THE QUESTION THAT YOU'RE ASKING THEM. IS INSINUATING THAT. THERE IS AMPLE TIME THAT IS CURRENTLY PROVIDED TO PARTICIPATE IN ELECTIONS. WHICH PREVENT DISPUTE THE NEED INTENT OF JOINING FOURTEEN OTHER STATES IN MAKING ELECTION DAY HOLIDAY. PART. ARE THERE EXAMPLES THERE CITED OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOT BEEN GIVEN THE TIME OFF TO BE ABLE TO VOTE WERE GOVERNMENT PLOY. SURE. IS I DON'T SEE THAT THE BACKGROUND. OKAY. OKAY. I IT. IF WE HAVE OUR WE WE'VE CONVERTED A LOT OF OUR. ELECTIONS TO VOTE BY MAIL. DOES THIS KICK AND IF THIS IS ALL VOTE BY MAIL ELECTION. THIS. FUNDAMENTALLY. PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY TO ALLOW FOR US TO. LOWER THE BARRIERS OF ENTRY AND PARTICIPATION. AND. OR NO VOTE IN THE PAST INDICATES THAT. PERHAPS YOU BELIEVE THAT THERE IS AMPLE. MATERNITY TO PARTICIPATE WHETHER IT BE VOTE BY MAIL WHETHER MP THREE LIMITED HOURS. BUT NOT EVERYONE FITS WITHIN THAT TIME FRAME. DOESN'T WORK FOR EVERYONE. SO WHY WOULD WE NOT WANT TO. LOWER AS MANY BEERS TO ENTRY. THAT IS THE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION WAS IT POINTED OUT IN EVERY ELECTION NOT JUST LECTURES THERE BICKLEY VOTE BY MAIL UP IN EVERY ELECTION ANYONE CAN BE A VOTE BY MAIL VOTER. AND DOT YOUR PERMANENT VOTE BY MAIL VOTER AYE THERE'S IN FACT A FOUR WEEK PERIOD WHEN THEY START MAILING OUT THOSE PERMANENT ABSENTEE BALLOTS. I TO BE ABLE TO CAST A BALLOT AND WE'VE ALSO LEGALIZE THE SITUATION WHICH I PEOPLE CAN DROP OFF THAT BALLOT IN THE MAIL. YOU'LL BE YOU'LL BE COUNTED IF IT'S RECEIVED BY THE REGISTRAR VOTERS AFTER ELECTION DAY. AS LONG AS IT'S POSTMARKED ON A BY ELECTION DAY AYE YOU ALSO HAVE A SITUATION WHERE THE BALLOT CAN BE BALLOT HARVESTED. IT BE TAKEN BY SOMEONE WHO'S NOT EVEN A FAMILY MEMBER TO THE BALLOT BOX TO THE RIGHT FOR VOTERS SIX ATRA. AYE YOU ALSO HAVE A SITUATION WHERE. BELT CAN BE DROPPED OFF ON ELECTION DAY. NOT TAKING THE SIGNUP AMOUNT OF TIME. THE THING I THINK IS IMPORTANT BE ABLE ASK. IS WHAT WAS THE FIGURE YOU SAID. THAT WAS VOTER PARTICIPATION FOR THE PRIMARY TWENTY FOURTEEN. THE ANSWER I'M GOING TO GIVE IS THAT IN ADDITION TO ALL THE ISSUES THAT YOU DECIDED AND WE ALSO WANNA MAKE ELECTION DAY HOLIDAY. TO MAKE IT THAT MUCH EASIER SO THEY DON'T SUPPORT THIS THEN YOU BUT I'D LIKE TO INCREASE HIGHER NOT TO ENTRY IN THAT IS OKAY. LOOK THE QUESTION I HAD IS THAT YOU CITED A FIGURE. AND I DID NOT CATCH THAT THAT WAS THE VOTER PROSPECT PARTICIPATION RATE CALIFORNIA. FOR THE PRIMARY IN TWENTY FOURTEEN HE OPENED WITH IT YES. WHAT WAS THE PERCENTAGE? THEN TWENTY FIVE PERCENT IN THE PRIMARY TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN. SO. IT WAS TWENTY FIVE PERCENT THE PRIMER TWENTY FOURTEEN. AND MISTREAT YOU PERCENT OF REGISTERED VOTERS PARTICIPATING THAT AND THAT WAS A FORTY TWO PERCENT IN THE GENERAL ELECTION. MISTER CHAIR I WOULD THINK YOU'D BE VERY IMPORTANT. UPDATE THE COMMITTEE THAT IN TWENTY FOUR BY SIXTEEN. THE VOTER RATE HAD INDEED SKYROCKETED. SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT WITHIN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE GENERAL ELECTION. AND I WOULD SAY THAT THE VOTER PARTICIPATION RATE HAS FAR MORE TO DO WITH VOTERS INTEREST IN VOTING FOR CANDIDATE AGAINST A CANDIDATE FOR A BALLOT INITIATIVE AGAINST THE BALLOT INITIATIVE. BASED UPON THEIR INFORMATION ON WHAT THEY FEEL QUALIFIES HIM TO BE A VOTER IN A PARTICULAR ELECTION RATHER THAN ANY BARRIERS BECAUSE AS I POINTED OUT. IF SOMEONE WANTS TO VOTE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THEY CAN VOTE OVER THE COURSE OF FOUR WEEKS WITH A VOTE BY MAIL BALLOT. THEY CAN HAVE THEIR BALLOT TAKEN TO THE POLLING PLACE THEY CAN TAKE THEIR BALLOT TO THE POLLING PLACE THEY CAN PUT IT IN THE MAIL. THE BARRIERS TO ENTRY IN THE STATE. ARE NOT SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH. BE ABLE TO BE GIVING A PAID HOLIDAY. TALL GOVERNMENT PLEASE. EXCLUSIVELY. AND GIVING A PARTICULAR VANTAGE TWO ONE SET OF VOTERS. TO OTHERS. BUT I WOULD ARGUE THAT IT'S NOT NECESSARY BECAUSE OF THE MANY WAYS. PEOPLE CAN ALREADY CAST A BALLOT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND MANY OF THOSE REFORMS INDEED PASSED IN A BIPARTISAN BASIS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR MY COMPASS MIXTURE THAT YOU MISS HARPER. CALDERON THANK YOU. MISTRESS WAS CLEAR THAT THE BILL IS A GOOD MAKES THE FIRST USING AT THE FIRST MONDAY NOVEMBER OF EACH EVEN NUMBERED YEAR STATE HOLIDAY SO WOULD BE TO THE AYE. AYE WELL I UNDERSTAND THE POINT THAT THE VICE CHAIR IS MAKING I JUST DON'T SEE A REALITY WHERE WE REALLY END UP WITH A HUNDRED PERCENT ALL MALE. VOTE BY MAIL ELECTIONS YOU HAVE INDIVIDUALS LIKE MYSELF I ACT LIKE A SOAP POLLS ABOUT MYSELF. I HAVE ALWAYS DONE THAT AND I I THINK I WILL ALWAYS. YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK IS PART OF PART PART OF THE THRILL. YOU KNOW I THINK THAT THE THE THE IDEA OF OR THE ISSUE BEING RAISED THAT THE VOTER REGISTRATION BE I MEAN THE VOTER TURNOUT BETWEEN TWENTY FOURTEEN TWENTY SIXTEEN IS BECAUSE OF A LOT OF THE MEASURES THAT WE PASS INCREASED ACCESS. I TO VOTING AND AND AND AND MAKE IT EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO VOTE I NAY REYES THOSE TYPES OF. DE TO TO PASS THOSE ISSUES AIR AND CREATE MORE OF US OUT OF OUR A HOSPITABLE SITUATION IN WHICH PEOPLE CAN CAN FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO HEAR CAST ABOUT HOW THEIR VOICE. HEARD. SO I MEAN I I I I AND I ALSO THINK THAT. YOU KNOW THERE THERE THERE THERE IS WISDOM. IN AND HOW YOU'RE APPROACHING THIS ISSUE SPECIFICALLY LIMITED LIMITING IT TO ARM YOU KNOW STATE EMPLOYEES ARE BECAUSE THERE WOULD BE AN IMPACT THAT I DON'T THINK I I MEAN I THINK WE WOULD SEE THE CAL CHAMBER UP HERE. AGAIN IF WE SAID OKAY FOR EVERYBODY EVEN INCLUDING IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR ARE YOU HAVE TO PAY A BUSINESS. PAID HOLIDAY FOR YOUR EMPLOYEES TO GO AND VOTE ON ELECTION DAY ARE I WOULD I PREFER I WOULD PREFER THAT. BUT I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT THAT WOULD BE AN IMPACT ON BUSINESS AND I DON'T THINK THAT THE. THAT ANYBODY ESPECIALLY MY COLLEAGUES ON THE OTHER SIDE THE AISLE WOULD ABS WOULD ACTUALLY NOT BE SUPPORTIVE OF SOMETHING LIKE THAT. I'M SURE THEY WOULDN'T HAPPY TO DO IT IF IT WAS WITHOUT PAY I BUT I UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT. TO BUSINESSES IF. IS A PAID HOLIDAY. AND AND AGAIN. YOU KNOW THERE'S JUST BEEN NO EMPHASIS FOR MY GENERATION IS NEXT GENERATION ON VOTING AND WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT FIRST THEY DON'T SEE GOVERNMENT AS AN EFFECTIVE PLACE TO CREATE CHANGE BECAUSE IT'S ALWAYS ABOUT. ONE PARTY IN ANOTHER PARTY FIGHTING EACH OTHER BECAUSE THAT'S THAT'S JUST THE WAY IT'S ALWAYS BEEN I'M RIGHT YOU'RE WRONG AND THAT'S THAT THAT'S GOVERNMENT. BUT THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE EMPHASIS AND VALUE PLACED IN THIS DAY AS AN ELECTION DAY HOUSE THAT THERE HAS TO BE MORE IMPORTANT SOMETHING THAT TAKES ATTENTION. OF THESE YONG INDIVIDUALS TO SAY YET IT'S A HOLIDAY BECAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT. EVERY A LOT OF THESE IMPORTANT DAYS WE CELEBRATED HOLIDAYS BECAUSE OF THEIR SIGNIFICANCE AND I THINK THAT I'M STARTING AT LEAST WITH OUR STATE EMPLOYEES. YOU YOU YOU RE EMPHASIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS BEING A SIGNIFICANT DAY TO OUR DEMOCRACY. A FUNDAMENTAL PILLAR OF OUR DEMOCRACY AND THE FACT THAT A WHOLE LOT OF PEOPLE OR A WHOLE LOT OF CENTURIES AND ARE DECADES HAVE FOUGHT. AND CONTINUE TO FIGHT TODAY. DEBT DEBT TO ALLOW US THIS RIGHT TO VOTE SO I THINK THAT ARE IT'S AN AND YOU KNOW IT IT'S SOMETHING SMALL. DOT I DON'T THINK YOU KNOW THE STATE LOSES ANYTHING. BECAUSE IF WE WOULD OF ALREADY BEEN PAYING FOR THAT DAY ANYWAYS. IF THEY WERE TO WORK OUT BUT I THINK IT'S MORE IMPORTANT FOR AT LEAST GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES TO. NET THAT THEIR WORK THAT THEY DON'T DO IS ALREADY IMPORTANT IT IS IMPORTANT IS NEEDED BUT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THEY SHOP AND REGISTER THAT. THAT VOTE AND HOPEFULLY ONE DAY WE CAN MOVE TO IT BEING ALSO AFFORDED TO PRIVATE SECTOR EMPLOYERS BUT I APPRECIATE THE BILL. I'M GONNA VOTE YES AND I'M OF THE BILL. THANK YOU MISTER CALDERON WAS MULLIN. I THINK MISS SHARON AND. THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMAN FOR BRINGING THE BILL I THINK IT IS A STATEMENT OF. OF THE IMPORTANCE OF ELECTION DAY AND. THE IMPORTANCE OF DEMOCRACY. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA UP TO THE VICE CHAIRS POINT I DO THINK WE ARE. TO SOME DEGREE DE EMPHASIZING ELECTION DAY ITSELF BECAUSE WE HAVE. OF THE SP FOUR FIFTY ERA UPON US WHERE MORE AND MORE COUNTIES WILL BE MOVING TO AN ALL MAIL BALLOT. ALL ELECTION SO I SORT OF CONSIDER ELECTION DATA BE ALMOST LIKE ELECTION MONTH BECAUSE THERE IS SO MUCH ACTIVITY WITH VOTING BY MAIL. AND I THINK THAT TREND IS IS PRETTY CLEAR BUT I THINK IT'S STILL. CRUCIAL TO TO STATE THE IMPORTANCE OF ELECTION DAY ITSELF BECAUSE EVEN IN THE ALL MAIL BALLOT. A COUNTIES LIKE MINE SAN MATEO COUNTY. THERE IS QUITE A BIT OF ACTIVITY ON ELECTION DAY ITSELF THERE ARE HIGH TECH VOTING CENTERS. SPREAD OUT THROUGHOUT THE COUNTY AYE IN EACH COMMUNITY WITH PAUL BOOKS AND A BALLOT PRINTING ACTIVITY IN THERE'S QUITE A BIT OF. ACTION ON ELECTION DAY ITSELF EVEN THOUGH WE'RE GOING TO BE AN ALL MAIL BALLOT A COUNTY SO OUGHT TO THAT EXTENT I SUPPORT THE EFFORT I KNOW THIS IS AN ONGOING ONE. LAW THAT HAS NOT MADE IT OUT OF APPROPRIATIONS A HOPEFULLY THAT WILL CHANGE THIS YEAR. LA IF THE BILL'S NOT BEEN MOVED ALL DO SO. OR AT LEAST A SECOND THE BILL AND THANK YOU FOR THE EFFORT. FITNESS MULLIN SO WE HAVE A MOTION BY MISTER CALDERON A SECOND AYE MR MULLIN. DOCTOR WEBER. QUICK QUESTION. IN THE A STAFF REPORT. AND MAYBE OF OTHER INFORMATION OTHER THINGS ARE GOING TO HAPPEN OF. BASICALLY SAYING THAT IN THE STATES I GUESS WHAT THEY'RE SIXTEEN STATE SOMETHING I DON'T KNOW FOURTEEN WHAT THINGS ARE DATES THAT HAVE ACTUALLY DONE THIS. THAT THERE'S BEEN NO. INCREASE IN VOTER PARTICIPATION AS A RESULT OF MAKING A HOLIDAY. WHAT WOULD WE DO DIFFERENT AS AS? AS A STATE THAT WOULD BASICALLY DRIVE FOLKS TO THE POLL. I KNOW WE'RE DOING ALL THESE THINGS AT A MONTH LONG LEAD WITH IT IS BEFORE FIFTIES LIVE OF EVERYTHING. OF WHAT DO WE DO TO TO WARRANT THIS HOLIDAY OF THIS DAY OFF THAT WOULD MAKE IT. THAT'S SIGNIFICANT SINCE OF THE STATE DONE IT HAVE SEEN NO INCREASE IN PARTICIPATION AT ALL. QUOTE BY A PART OF THE. IT IS FOR THIS ALSO WAS THERE A PEW RESEARCH STUDY THAT FOUND THAT SCHOOL WORK WAS ONE OF THE ATTRIBUTED FACTORS OF PARTICIPATION AND SO THE WAY THAT WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO CITE. ANY OTHER ADDITIONAL A STUDIES I'M WORKING WITH COMMITTEE STAFF AS WELL TO IDENTIFY THOSE SPECIFICS UP BUT AGAIN THE INTENT OF THE LEGISLATION IS NOT ONLY. ON DRIVING OUT PARTICIPATION BUT THE FUNDAMENTALS OF WHAT YOU'VE HEARD FROM FELLOW COMMITTEE MEMBERS WITH IS OUR CIVIC DUTIES AND THE IMPORTANCE OF THAT. AND SCHOOLS WOULD BE CLOSED. IS THAT CORRECT. WILK WILL WE WERE TALKING ABOUT STATE EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYEES NO NO NO THE LOCALS OKAY BECAUSE I WAS SEEING SOMETHING THEM SEE IT CA BECAUSE ADMINISTER. SCHOOLS THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL OF ASSOCIATION AND AND. AS THEY WERE SUPPORTING IT SO THEY WOULD NOT BE AFFECTED THEM THE LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICT AND MEDINA. OH OKAY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR LOAD YOUR TO CLOSE. A THE. THAT THE THAT THE FOCUS AGAIN ON SERVE OUR CIVICS. AND OUR PARTICIPATION. IS A CRUCIAL ONE AT JUST AS WE RECOGNIZE THAT OF. CESAR CHAVEZ DAY. OR AND OKAYED A THAT THE OPPORTUNITY FOR PARENTS TO TALK ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF THE MEANING OF THIS IT IS IS IMPORTANT. AND SO IN ADDITION TO THAT OF THE INTENT OF THE FUNDAMENTALS OF DRIVING THAT PARTICIPATION IN LAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION. AND SO. WITHOUT A RESPECTFULLY ASK VERY. THANK YOU MISTER LOWE. A LOT OF GOOD POINTS HAVE BEEN MADE TODAY I SUPPORTED. AN IDENTICAL BILL BY YOU LAST YEAR AND I WANT TO COMMEND YOU ON YOUR COMMITMENT TO TAKING STEPS TO MAKE.
