00:49:20.957 --> 00:49:22.426

IF THEIR PETS ARE SPAYED OR

00:56:02.325 --> 00:56:05.762
QUESTION ASSEMBLY MEMBER COOPER.

00:56:05.829 --> 00:56:08.565
IT'S SO I THINK IF WE'RE GOING

00:56:08.631 --> 00:56:09.766
TO BE HONEST THIS IS STILL A

00:56:09.833 --> 00:56:11.735
SMALL POPULATION OF FOLKS THAT

00:56:11.801 --> 00:56:13.503
ARE EVEN INTERESTED IN

00:56:13.570 --> 00:56:18.475
PURCHASING PET INSURANCE- V.

00:56:18.541 --> 00:56:19.909
THE STATEMENTS MADE BY THE

00:56:19.976 --> 00:56:21.711
OPPOSITION SORT OF PRESUME THAT

00:56:21.778 --> 00:56:23.113
THIS IS STATIC WHERE IF YOU'RE

00:56:23.179 --> 00:56:25.782
A PET OWNER YOU'RE ONLY DEALING

00:56:25.849 --> 00:56:26.316
WITH ONE PET IN YOUR NEVER

00:56:26.382 --> 00:56:29.018
GOING TO GET ANOTHER PET- BUT

00:56:29.085 --> 00:56:31.855
WE ALSO KNOW. THAT WITH OTHER

00:56:31.921 --> 00:56:36.292
FORMS OF INSURANCE- YOU THERE

00:56:36.359 --> 00:56:37.227
ARE CERTAIN THINGS THAT ARE

00:56:37.293 --> 00:56:40.363
PART OF THE BASIC COVERAGE-

00:56:40.430 --> 00:56:42.899
THAT YOU ARE NOT ABLE TO SELECT

00:56:42.966 --> 00:56:45.301
THE TO OPT OUT OF AND THIS IS

00:56:45.368 --> 00:56:48.772
ELEVATING STERILIZATION TO THAT

00:56:48.838 --> 00:56:51.074
LEVEL BASED ON TRUTHFULLY THE

00:56:51.141 --> 00:56:53.042
COMMUNITY IMPACT THAT ON

00:56:53.109 --> 00:56:56.513
STERILIZED ANIMALS- BECAUSE TO

00:56:56.579 --> 00:56:58.648
THE COMMUNITY. YOU KNOW THAT'S

00:56:58.715 --> 00:56:59.749
ONE IF YOU HAVE A KID PAT

00:56:59.816 --> 00:57:01.184
THAT'S NOT STERILIZE THAT'S OUT

00:57:01.251 --> 00:57:02.752
THERE PROCREATING IN OVER

00:57:02.819 --> 00:57:05.054
POPULATING THAT ACTUALLY COSTS

00:57:05.121 --> 00:57:07.557
MORE- NOT ONLY TO PET OWNERS

00:57:07.624 --> 00:57:10.794
pADDITIONAL COSTS- THAT COME

00:57:10.860 --> 00:57:12.228
FROM THESE AND I WANT TO SAY

00:57:12.295 --> 00:57:13.530
ROGUE ANIMALS BUT ANIMALS OUT

00:57:13.596 --> 00:57:15.365
THERE DOING STUFF- IT ALSO

00:57:15.431 --> 00:57:16.866
ACCELERATES THE COSTA COUNTY IS

00:57:16.933 --> 00:57:18.334
A BENEFIT THAT CAN CITIES AND

00:57:18.401 --> 00:57:20.270
COUNTIES HAVE TO COVER AS IT

00:57:20.336 --> 00:57:21.037
RELATES TO DEALING WITH YOUTH

00:57:21.104 --> 00:57:23.139
AND IDEATION- AND COMMUNITY

00:57:23.206 --> 00:57:24.440
BASED ORGANIZATIONS DEALING

00:57:24.507 --> 00:57:25.742
WITH STERILIZATION AFTER THE

00:57:25.809 --> 00:57:30.246
FACT. AND THE- DAMAGE THAT

00:57:30.313 --> 00:57:32.515
THOSE ANIMALS CAN ALSO COST TO

00:57:32.582 --> 00:57:33.983
NEIGHBORHOODS COMMUNITIES HOMES

00:57:34.050 --> 00:57:36.019
NEIGHBORS HOMES ETCETERA. SO IT

00:57:36.085 --> 00:57:38.788
IS TRUE. THAT YOU MAY HAVE A

00:57:38.855 --> 00:57:40.757
PET NOW. THAT'S ALREADY BEEN

00:57:40.824 --> 00:57:42.725
STERILIZED BUT IT'S ALSO TRUE

00:57:42.792 --> 00:57:45.195
GIVEN THE DEMOGRAPHIC OF FOLKS

00:57:45.261 --> 00:57:47.230
I GET INSURANCE THAT MANY OF

00:57:47.297 --> 00:57:49.132
THEM GET INSURANCE FOR PETS

00:57:49.199 --> 00:57:51.201
THAT ARE NOT STERILIZED FOLKS

00:57:51.267 --> 00:57:52.635
THAT ARE GETTING PADS FROM A

00:57:52.702 --> 00:57:53.970
RELATIVE FROM A FRIEND FROM A

00:57:54.037 --> 00:57:56.206
BREEDER FROM A STORE. THOSE

00:57:56.272 --> 00:57:58.474
PETS DON'T AUTOMATICALLY COME

00:57:58.541 --> 00:58:00.877
TO THEM STERILIZED. AND SO THIS

00:58:00.944 --> 00:58:02.979
WOULD SAY. IN THIS ACTUALLY

00:58:03.046 --> 00:58:04.514
ALSO DOESN'T SAY THAT YOU HAVE

00:58:04.581 --> 00:58:06.249
TO GET YOUR ANIMAL STERILIZED

00:58:06.316 --> 00:58:07.717
BUT IT DOES SAY THAT IF YOU'RE

00:58:07.784 --> 00:58:09.385
GONNA CONSIDER GETTING PET

00:58:09.452 --> 00:58:12.255
INSURANCE THAT THIS IS NOT AN

00:58:12.322 --> 00:58:14.824
ELECTIVE OPTION. YOU KNOW THE

00:58:14.891 --> 00:58:16.593
OPPOSITION DID MENTION THAT

00:58:16.659 --> 00:58:18.761
MANY OF THE INSURANCE COMPANIES

00:58:18.828 --> 00:58:20.663
DON'T OFFER THIS AND SOME SAY

00:58:20.730 --> 00:58:22.599
YOU CAN'T HAVE A PET THAT

00:58:22.665 --> 00:58:23.333
STERILIZED WHEN YOU GET

00:58:23.399 --> 00:58:24.701
INSURANCE. AND THEIR

00:58:24.767 --> 00:58:26.803
EXCLUSIONARY CLAUSES THAT ARE

00:58:26.870 --> 00:58:28.404
PART OF THE INSURANCE POLICY

00:58:28.471 --> 00:58:29.639
AND THEY SAY THAT BUT IF YOU

00:58:29.706 --> 00:58:31.040
GET ONE THAT ISN'T ENSURE THAT

00:58:31.107 --> 00:58:33.109
IT'S GOING TO COST YOU MORE. SO

00:58:33.176 --> 00:58:35.912
THEY'RE MAKING MONEY ON BOTH

00:58:35.979 --> 00:58:37.513
SIDES OF THE EQUATION. WHEN

00:58:37.580 --> 00:58:39.115
THIS TRIES TO BRING A LITTLE

00:58:39.182 --> 00:58:41.951
MORE EQUITY AND PARITY- ADD TO

00:58:42.018 --> 00:58:44.754
THE PET INSURANCE- COVERAGE

00:58:44.821 --> 00:58:47.690
POLICIES THAT ARE OFFERED. I

00:58:47.757 --> 00:58:49.559
MEAN YOU IT SAYS I GUESS YOU

00:58:49.626 --> 00:58:50.760
COULD ALSO TALK ABOUT OTHER

00:58:50.827 --> 00:58:52.695
KINDS OF ILLNESSES AND AILMENTS

00:58:52.762 --> 00:58:55.865
THAT ANIMALS HAVE- YOU DON'T

00:58:55.932 --> 00:58:57.166
THINK MOST PEOPLE I WOULD

00:58:57.233 --> 00:58:57.934
ASSUME WE'RE NOT GETTING

00:58:58.001 --> 00:58:59.669
INSURANCE THINKING ARE

00:58:59.736 --> 00:59:01.537
ANTICIPATING A PROCEDURE IS

00:59:01.604 --> 00:59:02.538
GOING TO BE NECESSARY BUT

00:59:02.605 --> 00:59:04.407
HOPING THEY DON'T HAVE TO PAY

00:59:04.474 --> 00:59:04.941
FOR IT IF IT DOES BECOME

00:59:05.008 --> 00:59:07.043
NECESSARY. WOULD YOU AGREE THAT

00:59:07.110 --> 00:59:09.178
THE PENSIONS IS NOT CHEAP AT

00:59:09.245 --> 00:59:09.913
ALL SO IT'S A IT'S A CERTAIN

00:59:09.979 --> 00:59:12.515
UNIQUE MARKET. AND WITH THOSE

00:59:12.582 --> 00:59:13.816
FOLKS THE RESPONSIBLE PET

00:59:13.883 --> 00:59:18.321
OWNERS ALREADY. SO I GUESS AT

00:59:18.388 --> 00:59:21.691
THE END OF THE DAY- THE POLICY.

00:59:21.758 --> 00:59:23.359
I GET WITH THE NEW POLICY IS

00:59:23.426 --> 00:59:27.030

AT FOR MAYBE FIVE SIX YEARS BUT

01:01:31.387 --> 01:01:34.590
GENERALLY THE COST BETWEEN THE

01:01:34.657 --> 01:01:36.592
TWO OPTIONS ARE NOT THAT

01:01:36.659 --> 01:01:38.294
EXPENSIVE BECAUSE ONCE AGAIN

01:01:38.361 --> 01:01:41.397

01:01:41.464 --> 01:01:43.933
COMPANIES THAT I'VE SEEN FOR

UNFUNDED MANDATE FROM THE STATE

AND PROBLEM. ALL FOR THE STATE

01:02:22.672 --> 01:02:24.941
OF CALIFORNIA AND COMING FROM A

01:02:25.007 --> 01:02:27.276
FAMILY OF ANIMAL LOVERS IT WAYS

01:02:27.343 --> 01:02:30.913
HAD- PETS IN WHICH WE ADOPTED

01:02:30.980 --> 01:02:33.282
FROM THE SHELTER. AND DOES

01:02:33.349 --> 01:02:35.351
CLOSE FOR NON MYSELF BUT MY

WE GO TO THE SHELTER AS YOU

01:02:39.455 --> 01:02:41.891
KNOW UNDER STATE LAW- WHETHER

01:02:41.958 --> 01:02:44.527
IT'S A CAT OR A DOG AND BY LAW

01:02:44.594 --> 01:02:46.229
THEY HAVE TO SPARE AND NEUTER.

01:02:46.295 --> 01:02:48.965
THESE ANIMALS. AND FOR THOSE

01:02:49.031 --> 01:02:52.668
THAT WANT TO GET THESE- TAX

01:02:52.735 --> 01:02:54.971
FROM ANIMAL SHELTERS AND THEY

01:02:55.037 --> 01:02:56.439
ALSO WANT TO PURCHASE

01:02:56.506 --> 01:02:58.941
INSURANCE. TO PAY FOR SOMETHING

01:02:59.008 --> 01:03:02.111
THAT THEY DON'T NEED I THINK IS

01:03:02.178 --> 01:03:04.413
AN ISSUE OF FAIRNESS IS THERE A

01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:05.948
POSSIBILITY ABOUT THE AUTHOR

01:03:06.015 --> 01:03:08.784
WOULD ANNOTATED UP AND OPT OUT

01:03:08.851 --> 01:03:09.652
FOR THOSE TYPE INDIVIDUALS

01:03:09.719 --> 01:03:12.121
THAT. ARE ADOPTING A PET FROM A

01:03:12.188 --> 01:03:13.523
SHELTER THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN

01:03:13.589 --> 01:03:14.524
SPAYED HAS ALREADY BEEN

01:03:14.590 --> 01:03:16.192
NEUTERED DO YOU HAVE A CHOICE

01:03:16.259 --> 01:03:20.530
OF OPTING OUT OF THAT. TYPE OF

01:03:20.596 --> 01:03:22.832
MANDATED PAYMENT. THANK YOU.

01:03:22.899 --> 01:03:24.233
THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION I

01:03:24.300 --> 01:03:25.334
THINK THAT THAT'S SOMETHING

01:03:25.401 --> 01:03:27.069
THAT WE CAN STILL CONTINUE TO

01:03:27.136 --> 01:03:29.105
DISCUSS IT WASN'T RAISED BY THE

01:03:29.172 --> 01:03:31.274
OPPOSITION BUT I TRY TO BE A

01:03:31.340 --> 01:03:34.076
COALITION BUILDER WITH MY BILLS

01:03:34.143 --> 01:03:36.145
I THINK IT IS AN IMPORTANT TO

01:03:36.212 --> 01:03:41.784
NOTE THAT YOU PEOPLE- A CHOIR.

01:03:41.851 --> 01:03:43.386
HEX FROM ALL DIFFERENT IN ALL

01:03:43.452 --> 01:03:45.388
DIFFERENT WAYS AND SO IT IS

01:03:45.454 --> 01:03:46.589
STILL A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF

01:03:46.656 --> 01:03:49.559
FOLKS THAT- EVEN OPT TO HAVE

01:03:49.625 --> 01:03:53.629
HAD INSURANCE- AND JUST BECAUSE

01:03:53.696 --> 01:03:56.098
YOU GET A NOT EVERYONE GETS A

01:03:56.165 --> 01:03:57.833
PET GETS A PET FROM THE SHELTER

01:03:57.900 --> 01:04:00.336
AND WE KNOW THAT MANY- SHELTERS

01:04:00.403 --> 01:04:02.238
DO REQUIRE THAT YOU HAVE YOUR

01:04:02.305 --> 01:04:03.406
PETS SPAYED OR NEUTERED IF

01:04:03.472 --> 01:04:04.373
YOU'RE GOING TO GET IT FROM

01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:05.808
THERE BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT

01:04:05.875 --> 01:04:07.777
THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER PET

01:04:07.843 --> 01:04:08.711
OWNERS THAT ARE GETTING PETS

01:04:08.778 --> 01:04:11.180
NOT FROM THEIR SHELTERS- AND SO

01:04:11.247 --> 01:04:12.415
THEY'RE ALSO GETTING PETS THAT

01:04:12.481 --> 01:04:14.584
HAVE NOT BEEN STERILIZED. TO MR

01:04:14.650 --> 01:04:18.354
VOEPEL POINT- WE LOOK AT THE

01:04:18.421 --> 01:04:20.489
TOTAL COST FOR THE SMALL

01:04:20.556 --> 01:04:22.024
PERCENTAGE OF POLICY HOLDERS

01:04:22.091 --> 01:04:24.460
THAT ACTUALLY DO TAKE ADVANTAGE

01:04:24.527 --> 01:04:26.495
OF THIS COVERAGE- WERE THAT

01:04:26.562 --> 01:04:28.364
THAT EVERYONE WOULD ACTUALLY

01:04:28.431 --> 01:04:30.600
PAY ABOUT FOURTEEN TO TWENTY

01:04:30.666 --> 01:04:31.968
SEVEN CENTS PER MONTH AN

01:04:32.034 --> 01:04:35.504
ADDITIONAL COST- IF THIS IS

01:04:35.571 --> 01:04:38.407
LAW- SO THAT IS A SMALL-

01:04:38.474 --> 01:04:41.877
INCREASES SO I JUST WANTED TO

01:04:41.944 --> 01:04:42.511
SHARE THAT SINCE THAT HAVE COME

01:04:42.578 --> 01:04:45.081
UP. ARE THERE ANY OTHER

01:04:45.147 --> 01:04:47.950
QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS- AS I

01:04:48.017 --> 01:04:50.019
MENTIONED- THAT THIS DOES

01:04:50.086 --> 01:04:52.221
HAPPEN THIS BILL AS A DO PASS

01:04:52.288 --> 01:04:55.224
RECOMMENDATION HOWEVER- I GAVE

01:04:55.291 --> 01:04:57.093
THE MEMBERS AN OPPORTUNITY TO

01:04:57.159 --> 01:04:59.795
MAKE A MOTION AND A- IT WAS

01:04:59.862 --> 01:05:02.398
PRETTY SILENT- HEY NOW AT THAT

01:05:02.465 --> 01:05:08.471
TIME- SO. I'M NOT SURE THERE

01:05:08.537 --> 01:05:09.905
WILL BE A VOTE BECAUSE NO ONE'S

01:05:09.972 --> 01:05:12.708
MADE A MOTION. DO YOU HAVE

01:05:12.775 --> 01:05:13.843
ANYTHING ELSE YOU'D LIKE TO ADD

01:05:13.909 --> 01:05:15.378
MISS COM LOCAL YOU KNOW I WOULD

01:05:15.444 --> 01:05:18.848
JUST ASK FOR CONSIDERATION- AND

01:05:18.914 --> 01:05:21.617
HOPE THAT BEFORE- THIS

01:05:21.684 --> 01:05:23.119
COMMITTEE INTERNS THAT THAT

01:05:23.185 --> 01:05:24.920
THIS MIGHT BE M. BROUGHT UP FOR

01:05:24.987 --> 01:05:25.821
A VOTE AND THAT THAT COULD

01:05:25.888 --> 01:05:27.990
HAPPEN. I AM RESPECTFULLY

01:05:28.057 --> 01:05:29.425
ASKING FOR AN AYE VOTE AND WANT

01:05:29.492 --> 01:05:30.926
FOLKS TO KNOW THAT WE HAD A

01:05:30.993 --> 01:05:32.662
VERY GOOD DISCUSSION WITH THE

01:05:32.728 --> 01:05:34.664
OPPOSITION YESTERDAY AND WE

01:05:34.730 --> 01:05:35.765
ACTUALLY ARE IN AGREEMENT ON

01:05:35.831 --> 01:05:37.099
THE CANCELLATION NOTICE WHICH

01:05:37.166 --> 01:05:38.100
IS THE PORTION OF THIS

01:05:38.167 --> 01:05:39.969
PARTICULAR BILL. I'M AND WE

01:05:40.036 --> 01:05:42.738
RECOGNIZE THAT- FOLKS THAT WANT

01:05:42.805 --> 01:05:44.407
PET INSURANCE STILL REPRESENT A

01:05:44.473 --> 01:05:47.710
VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE. OF THE

01:05:47.777 --> 01:05:49.945
INSURANCE POPULATION BUT WE

01:05:50.012 --> 01:05:51.480
ALSO KNOW THAT NOT HAVING

01:05:51.547 --> 01:05:53.683
ANIMAL STERILIZED CONTRIBUTES

01:05:53.749 --> 01:05:56.419
TO SO MANY COSTS THAT BOTH PET

01:05:56.485 --> 01:05:58.654
OWNERS- AND CITIES AND COUNTIES

01:05:58.721 --> 01:06:00.122
HAVE TO BEAR. AND THIS IS

01:06:00.189 --> 01:06:01.791
CERTAINLY NOT A SOLUTION THAT

01:06:01.857 --> 01:06:04.827
WILL FIX ALL OF- YOU KNOW THE

01:06:04.894 --> 01:06:06.295
ISSUES THAT. SURROUND OVER

01:06:06.362 --> 01:06:07.630
POPULATION AND USE THAT AS A

01:06:07.697 --> 01:06:09.732
NATION OF ANIMALS BUT IT IS AN

01:06:09.799 --> 01:06:11.133
OPPORTUNITY FOR EVERYONE TO

01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:13.636
STEP IN AND DO THEIR PART- WE

01:06:13.703 --> 01:06:15.504
DO KNOW THAT I THINK TO PANDIAN

01:06:15.571 --> 01:06:18.974
WHICH IS. A BRAND. OR A ONE OF

01:06:19.041 --> 01:06:21.177
THE PARTICULAR AT PET INSURANCE

01:06:21.243 --> 01:06:25.781
POLICY PRODUCTS- IS. SUGGESTED

01:06:25.848 --> 01:06:27.850
TO BE ONE OF THE BETTER PLANS.

01:06:27.917 --> 01:06:29.018
IT IS ALSO ONE OF THE MOST

01:06:29.085 --> 01:06:31.554
EXPENSIVE PLANS AND IT IS ALSO

01:06:31.620 --> 01:06:33.055
A PLAN THAT SAYS IF YOU'RE

01:06:33.122 --> 01:06:34.924
GOING TO GET COVERAGE YOUR PET

01:06:34.990 --> 01:06:37.793
CANNOT BE STERILIZED. SO YOU

01:06:37.860 --> 01:06:39.061
CAN YOU HAVE TO HAVE AN ANSWER

01:06:39.128 --> 01:06:41.097
ALIVE IN ORDER TO GET THE PET

01:06:41.163 --> 01:06:43.065
INSURANCE AND THEN IF YOU WANT

01:06:43.132 --> 01:06:44.600
YOUR PET TO BE STERILIZED THEN

01:06:44.667 --> 01:06:47.203
YOU HAVE TO PAY- AN EXORBITANT

01:06:47.269 --> 01:06:49.672
FEE. SO THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY

01:06:49.739 --> 01:06:51.207
TO KIND OF NOT ALLOW THOSE

01:06:51.273 --> 01:06:52.341
KINDS OF THINGS TO HAPPEN

01:06:52.408 --> 01:06:54.076
BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT ANIMAL

01:06:54.143 --> 01:06:55.778
OWNERS DO WANT THEIR PETS TO BE

01:06:55.845 --> 01:06:58.013
STERILE THOSE THAT DO DO. AND

01:06:58.080 --> 01:06:59.682
WE KNOW THAT INSURANCE

01:06:59.749 --> 01:07:02.818
COMPANIES. DON'T WANT TO HAVE

01:07:02.885 --> 01:07:03.986
TO WELL WE ALSO KNOW THAT WHEN

01:07:04.053 --> 01:07:05.755
ANIMALS ARE NOT STERILIZED.

01:07:05.821 --> 01:07:06.822
THEY HAVE A NUMBER OF OTHER

01:07:06.889 --> 01:07:09.225
HEALTH ISSUES- THAT COMPLICATE

01:07:09.291 --> 01:07:10.793
THEIR ABILITY TO LIVE A LIFE

01:07:10.860 --> 01:07:13.229
AND ALSO. A RESULT IN MANY

01:07:13.295 --> 01:07:15.164
INCREASED COSTS TO THE PET

01:07:15.231 --> 01:07:16.665
OWNERS AND SO THIS IS ALSO AN

01:07:16.732 --> 01:07:19.235
OPPORTUNITY. ON THEFRONT END

01:07:19.301 --> 01:07:21.504
TO STOP THOSE KINDS OF COSTS

01:07:21.570 --> 01:07:23.139
THAT PET OWNERS WOULD HAVE TO

01:07:23.205 --> 01:07:25.908
FACE- SO. ONCE AGAIN I'VE JUST

01:07:25.975 --> 01:07:27.476
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR

01:07:27.543 --> 01:07:29.512
