00:07:45.865 --> 00:07:48.835
WILL BE SUBJECT TO THIS SO --

00:07:48.901 --> 00:07:51.070
THE RESEARCH AT ANTICIPATED

00:07:51.137 --> 00:07:53.039
ABOUT FIFTEEN HUNDRED PEOPLE PER

00:07:53.105 --> 00:07:54.140
YEAR.

00:07:54.207 --> 00:07:55.474
WOULD BE.

00:07:55.541 --> 00:07:57.643
THEN INCLUDED ON THE PROHIBITED

00:07:57.710 --> 00:08:00.980
PERSONS LIST AND I'M VERY HAPPY

00:08:01.047 --> 00:08:02.315
TO DISCUSS.

00:08:02.381 --> 00:08:05.484
THE PARTIAL -- RETROACTIVITY

00:08:05.551 --> 00:08:07.820
ISSUE THAT IS MENTIONED HERE SO

00:08:07.887 --> 00:08:08.654
IF WE MADE THIS FULLY

00:08:08.721 --> 00:08:10.623
RETROACTIVE I COULD SEE WHERE

00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:12.391
YOU MIGHT END UP HAVING TO GO

00:08:12.458 --> 00:08:13.926
BACK AND LOOK AT PEOPLE'S

00:08:13.993 --> 00:08:15.528
RECORDS AND I COULD SEE THAT IS

00:08:15.595 --> 00:08:16.162
A PROBLEM.

00:08:16.229 --> 00:08:17.396
IF WE MAKE IT PARTIALLY

00:08:17.463 --> 00:08:20.499
RETROACTIVE SO THAT.

00:08:20.566 --> 00:08:24.637
IF A PERSON IS PUTTING IN --

00:08:24.704 --> 00:08:25.805
TWENTY TWENTY CONVICTED OF A D.

00:08:25.872 --> 00:08:26.939
Y..

00:08:27.006 --> 00:08:29.308
AND IN THAT RECORD THE COURT

00:08:29.375 --> 00:08:31.277
OBSERVED THAT THEY HAVE HAD THE

00:08:31.344 --> 00:08:32.578
REQUISITE NUMBER OF PRIOR

00:08:32.645 --> 00:08:33.813
CONVICTIONS.

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:35.681
THEN THE COURT WOULD THEN APPLY

00:08:35.748 --> 00:08:37.016
THE PROHIBITED PERSONS

00:08:37.083 --> 00:08:38.985
RESTRICTION WHICH WOULD THEN BE

00:08:39.051 --> 00:08:41.787
REPORTED TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL.

00:08:41.854 --> 00:08:44.290
AT A RATE OF AND NO MORE THAN

00:08:44.357 --> 00:08:45.691
FIFTEEN HUNDRED A YEAR A FIVE

00:08:45.758 --> 00:08:49.328
MILLION DOLLAR FIGURE SEEMS.

00:08:49.395 --> 00:08:51.864
JUST -- OUT OF WHACK IF YOU WILL

00:08:51.931 --> 00:08:55.134
SO -- HAPPY TO WORK THROUGH THAT

00:08:55.201 --> 00:08:57.637
IF THAT IS INDEED THE BASIS UPON

00:08:57.703 --> 00:08:59.038
THAT FIVE MILLION DOLLAR FIGURE

00:08:59.105 --> 00:09:02.174
BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT THIS IS --

00:09:02.241 --> 00:09:03.809
DOESN'T CORRELATE CERTAINLY WITH

00:09:03.876 --> 00:09:05.711
MY EXPECTATIONS AND

00:09:05.778 --> 00:09:07.179
UNDERSTANDING WHAT THE BILL DOES

00:09:07.246 --> 00:09:09.081
AND DOESN'T DO SO I WOULD LOVE

00:09:09.148 --> 00:09:11.050
THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK FURTHER

00:09:11.117 --> 00:09:11.651
WITH YOU ON THAT AND SEE IF WE

00:09:11.717 --> 00:09:13.586
COULDN'T -- TRY TO COME TO A

00:09:13.653 --> 00:09:15.588
NUMBER THAT SEEMS AT LEAST OR IS.

00:09:15.655 --> 00:09:18.925
MORE REALISTIC IN TERMS OF WHAT

00:09:18.991 --> 00:09:19.525
THE BILL WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO

00:09:19.592 --> 00:09:20.493

00:16:09.101 --> 00:16:10.836
THAT THERE HAS BEEN AND THAT THE

THIS COMMITTEE ALSO WAS AGREED

TO ADD ADDITIONAL FUNDS.

00:16:14.907 --> 00:16:16.542

VIOLENCE THIS THE MEASURE IS

00:16:20.045 --> 00:16:22.915
BASED UPON ACTUAL RESEARCH.

00:16:22.981 --> 00:16:24.983
AND FOR YEARS MANY OF US HAVE

00:16:25.050 --> 00:16:28.821
HYPOTHESIZED AND THE THROUGH --

00:16:28.887 --> 00:16:31.423
ANECDOTAL INFORMATION WE BELIEVE

00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:34.526
CERTAIN THINGS WE FINALLY IN

00:16:34.593 --> 00:16:35.894
TWENTY FIFTEEN ACTUALLY PUT

00:16:35.961 --> 00:16:39.298
MONEY INTO CREATING A RESEARCH.

00:16:39.365 --> 00:16:42.167
FACILITY TO LOOK AT GUN VIOLENCE

00:16:42.234 --> 00:16:43.936
THE RESULTS ARE THE ARE

00:16:44.002 --> 00:16:45.971
REFLECTED IN THIS BILL WE KNOW

00:16:46.038 --> 00:16:47.573
THAT PEOPLE.

00:16:47.639 --> 00:16:48.841
WHO HAVE?

00:16:48.907 --> 00:16:51.143
DEMONSTRATED THE INABILITY TO

00:16:51.210 --> 00:16:53.946
MAKE GOOD JUDGMENTS AND HAD

00:16:54.012 --> 00:16:54.747
THREE OR MORE.

00:16:54.813 --> 00:16:56.982
A D. Y. CONVICTIONS AND OTHER

00:16:57.049 --> 00:16:59.618
ALCOHOL TYPE RELATED OFFENSES.

00:16:59.685 --> 00:17:05.324
DURING THE PAST TEN YEARS OR

00:17:05.391 --> 00:17:06.859
FOUR TO FIVE TIMES MORE LIKELY.

00:17:06.925 --> 00:17:07.993
TO USE A FIREARM IN A FUTURE

00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:11.029
CRIMINAL ACT THAT IS THE

00:17:11.096 --> 00:17:13.332
RESEARCH THAT IS UNCONTROVERTED

00:17:13.399 --> 00:17:16.201
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO AS WAS

00:17:16.268 --> 00:17:18.570
JUST ARTICULATED IS TO PREVENT

00:17:18.637 --> 00:17:20.372
THE COST NOT ONLY THE SOCIAL

00:17:20.439 --> 00:17:22.674
COSTS BUT THE FISCAL COST TO

00:17:22.741 --> 00:17:23.442
SOCIETY.

00:17:23.509 --> 00:17:26.578
AND AGAIN I DON'T THINK FIVE

00:17:26.645 --> 00:17:27.579
MILLION IS AN ACCURATE NUMBER

00:17:27.646 --> 00:17:29.982
BUT WHATEVER THAT NUMBER IS IS

00:17:30.048 --> 00:17:31.083
FAR LESS THAN THE COSTS

00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:32.885
ASSOCIATED WITH THE KIND OF

00:17:32.951 --> 00:17:34.953
VIOLENCE THAT WE SEE FROM THESE

00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:35.721
PEOPLE.

00:17:35.788 --> 00:17:36.789
WHO ARE HAVE THE GREATER

00:17:36.855 --> 00:17:40.058
PROPENSITY TO BEHAVE IN A WAY

00:17:40.125 --> 00:17:42.661
THAT INFLICTS FIREARM BASED HARM

00:17:42.728 --> 00:17:45.664

UNDER FOUR THANK YOU SEEING NO

00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:55.908
OTHER QUESTIONS WITHOUT

00:17:55.974 --> 00:17:57.910
OBJECTION SB FIFTY FIVE WILL GO

00:17:57.976 --> 00:17:59.545
TO SUSPENSE.

00:17:59.611 --> 00:18:01.613
SB ONE SIXTY EMERGENCIES

00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:06.251
CULTURAL COMPETENCE IS ALSO A

00:18:06.318 --> 00:18:06.518
SUSPENSE.

00:18:06.585 --> 00:18:07.853
ITEM.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF THIS

HIGHLIGHT FOR YOU BECAUSE IT IS

00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:14.159
A BILL THAT DIRECTS COUNTIES TO

00:18:14.226 --> 00:18:15.961
INTEGRATE THE NEEDS.

00:18:16.028 --> 00:18:17.329
OF CULTURALLY DIVERSE

00:18:17.396 --> 00:18:19.465
COMMUNITIES INTO THE NEXT UPDATE

00:18:19.531 --> 00:18:22.601
OF THEIR COUNTY EMERGENCY PLANS.

00:18:22.668 --> 00:18:24.870
AS WE SEE CLIMATE CHANGE AND

00:18:24.937 --> 00:18:27.906
WILDFIRES IN MAJOR AND DRAMATIC.

00:18:27.973 --> 00:18:29.575
EVENTS OCCURRING THROUGHOUT OUR

00:18:29.641 --> 00:18:31.343
STATE OUR NATION AND INDEED OUR

00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:32.244
WORLD.

00:18:32.311 --> 00:18:34.379
IT IS CLEAR THAT WE NEED TO DO

00:18:34.446 --> 00:18:36.648
BETTER TO ADDRESS COMMUNITIES

00:18:36.715 --> 00:18:39.251
WHO OTHERWISE ARE NOT PROVIDED

00:18:39.318 --> 00:18:41.787
WITH THE NECESSARY INFORMATION.

00:18:41.854 --> 00:18:44.122
OR PROTECTIONS WHEN THESE EVENTS

00:18:44.189 --> 00:18:45.324
OCCUR.

00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:47.259
DURING A HEARING OF OUR JOINT

00:18:47.326 --> 00:18:48.627
LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE ON

00:18:48.694 --> 00:18:50.329
EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT JUST A FEW

00:18:50.395 --> 00:18:52.531
MONTHS AGO THE POINT WAS MADE

00:18:52.598 --> 00:18:53.866
THAT IT'S NOT ENOUGH FOR

00:18:53.932 --> 00:18:55.634
COUNTIES TO HAVE A STAFF MEMBER

00:18:55.701 --> 00:18:56.668
PROFICIENT.

00:18:56.735 --> 00:18:58.637
IN A LANGUAGE THAT IS

00:18:58.704 --> 00:19:00.839
SIGNIFICANT WITHIN A COMMUNITY

00:19:00.906 --> 00:19:02.975
IT ALSO REQUIRES THE COUNTY TO

00:19:03.041 --> 00:19:04.643
HAVE A COMPLEMENTARY AND

00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:07.479
COMPREHENSIVE UNDERSTANDING OF

00:19:07.546 --> 00:19:08.814
THE CULTURAL AND SOCIAL THE

00:19:08.881 --> 00:19:10.983
DYNAMICS OF THAT COMMUNITY WHICH

00:19:11.049 --> 00:19:12.851
WE REFER TO AS CULTURAL

00:19:12.918 --> 00:19:13.619
COMPETENCE.

00:19:13.685 --> 00:19:15.821
SO THIS MEASURE WILL REQUIRE

00:19:15.888 --> 00:19:17.456
LOCAL EMERGENCY PLANS TO

00:19:17.523 --> 00:19:19.091

00:19:23.462 --> 00:19:24.596
AT A MINIMUM.

00:19:24.663 --> 00:19:26.899
HOW ALL CULTURAL POPULATIONS

00:19:26.965 --> 00:19:28.967
WITHIN THEIR JURISDICTION ARE

00:19:29.034 --> 00:19:30.068
SERVED BY EMERGENCY

TO COMPLY WITH THESE --

PROCESS CLAIMS WITHIN KAISER SEE

00:46:57.114 --> 00:46:58.282
THAT THERE'S BEEN AN INTERNAL

THAT KAISER COLLECTS.

00:47:03.453 --> 00:47:05.189
ABOUT EACH OF THE VISITS --

00:47:05.255 --> 00:47:06.356
KAISER NOW CREATES WHAT ARE

00:47:06.423 --> 00:47:08.325
CALLED ENCOUNTER AND CLAIMS DATA

00:47:08.392 --> 00:47:09.993
FOR EVERYONE AND THIS WOULD MAKE

00:47:10.060 --> 00:47:11.195
POSSIBLE NOT ONLY COMPLIANCE

00:47:11.261 --> 00:47:12.763
WITH EXISTING LAWS REQUIRED

00:47:12.829 --> 00:47:13.397
UNDER THIS BILL.

00:47:13.463 --> 00:47:16.099
BUT ALSO -- DEVELOPMENT OF IT

00:47:16.166 --> 00:47:18.068
HAS ALSO FACILITATED KAISER'S

00:47:18.135 --> 00:47:19.770

00:47:33.884 --> 00:47:34.918
REASONS THAT WE BELIEVE THAT

00:47:45.162 --> 00:47:46.430

SINCE AS YOU'VE HEARD IT ONLY

00:51:01.158 --> 00:51:02.959

00:51:03.026 --> 00:51:05.128

IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT --

00:51:19.075 --> 00:51:20.477
I THINK THIS BILL UNFORTUNATELY --

00:51:20.544 --> 00:51:21.778
DEMONSTRATES A REAL LACK OF

00:51:21.845 --> 00:51:23.346
UNDERSTANDING OF HOW KAISER

00:51:23.413 --> 00:51:24.414
PERMANENTE IS DIFFERENT AND OUR

00:51:24.481 --> 00:51:25.649
INTEGRATED MODEL AND HOW WE ARE

00:51:25.715 --> 00:51:26.883
DIFFERENT FROM.

IMPROVING QUALITY AND ACCESS.

00:51:36.626 --> 00:51:38.228
OF THIS BILL AT DOESN'T DO ANY

00:51:38.295 --> 00:51:40.931
OF THAT SO WE HAVE CONCERNS

00:51:40.997 --> 00:51:41.865

00:51:49.372 --> 00:51:50.373
STATE MONEY TO IMPLEMENT AND

00:51:50.440 --> 00:51:51.842
ACTUALLY -- ANALYSIS POINTS OUT

00:51:51.908 --> 00:51:53.210
THAT IT COULD ACTUALLY COST

00:51:53.276 --> 00:51:55.378
