PERMISSION THAT FIFTEEN DAY CAN

01:22:07.055 --> 01:22:08.757
BE VERY COMPLICATED FOR PEOPLE

01:22:08.823 --> 01:22:09.858

WAY THAT THEY FEAR DYING BEFORE

THEY'RE ABLE. TO USE THE LAW

01:22:28.376 --> 01:22:29.944
THAT WAS PASSED FOR THEM NOT TO

BE ABLE TO DIE IN WAYS THAT.

01:22:31.513 --> 01:22:32.947
THEY DON'T CARE FOR JUST

BROOD REDUCE THAT DOWN TO FORTY

01:22:37.619 --> 01:22:38.453

01:22:47.195 --> 01:22:48.997
MEDICATION. WE THINK THAT WILL

01:22:49.064 --> 01:22:50.732
NOT GO FAR FOR AND PEOPLE BEING

01:22:50.799 --> 01:22:51.833
ABLE TO AND GET PEOPLE CAN'T

01:22:51.900 --> 01:22:53.268
TAKE UP TO FIFTEEN DAYS BUT

01:22:53.335 --> 01:22:54.869
THEY MAY BE ABLE TO USE IT IN

01:22:54.936 --> 01:22:56.671
IN TWO DAYS. IF NEEDED TO DO

01:22:56.738 --> 01:22:58.873
THAT SECOND REQUEST. IT IS ALSO

01:22:58.940 --> 01:22:59.808
BECOME VERY CLEAR THAT THAT

01:22:59.874 --> 01:23:01.109
SECOND WRITTEN REQUEST

01:23:01.176 --> 01:23:01.876

01:23:01.943 --> 01:23:04.245
ATTESTATION. IS UNNECESSARY IT

01:23:04.312 --> 01:23:05.213
IS GIVEN TO THE PATIENT BY

01:23:05.280 --> 01:23:06.514
THEIR ATTENDING PHYSICIAN AND

01:23:06.581 --> 01:23:08.583
THEY MUST. YET ONCE AGAIN WHEN

01:23:08.650 --> 01:23:10.218
THEY'RE ALONE SIGN TO SAY YES I

01:23:10.285 --> 01:23:12.387
AM YES I'M STILL SURE- AND THAT

01:23:12.454 --> 01:23:13.555
AGAIN WE DON'T THINK THAT

01:23:13.621 --> 01:23:15.223
FOURTH TIME TO BE ABLE TO DO IT

01:23:15.290 --> 01:23:17.292
IS REDUNDANT. FAMILIES FIND IT

01:23:17.359 --> 01:23:20.662
OFFENSIVE- IF YOU WILL- AND SO

01:23:20.729 --> 01:23:21.696
WE'RE SAYING THAT THAT SHOULD

01:23:21.763 --> 01:23:23.698
BE ABLE TO GO THERE ARE ENOUGH

01:23:23.765 --> 01:23:25.066

THIS IS THE MOST DIFFICULT BILL

01:59:57.990 --> 01:59:59.559
THAT AT THE TIME IT ACTUALLY

01:59:59.625 --> 02:00:00.993
SAYS ACTUALLY MOST DIFFICULT

02:00:01.060 --> 02:00:03.596
BILL WHATEVER VOTED ON- AND I

02:00:03.663 --> 02:00:05.932
ALSO THINK THAT THIS BODY-

02:00:05.998 --> 02:00:07.800
ROSE. TO THE OCCASION CHAU

02:00:07.867 --> 02:00:09.702

02:00:13.339 --> 02:00:15.708
TALKING TO ANOTHER MEMBER ABOUT

02:00:15.775 --> 02:00:18.010

THE FLOOR- IN SUPPORT- I

02:00:20.279 --> 02:00:21.180
THOUGHT CAME FROM REPUBLICAN

02:00:21.247 --> 02:00:23.082
THAT DAY AND- I THOUGHT THE

02:00:23.149 --> 02:00:24.216
BEST SPEECH OPPOSED CAME FROM

02:00:24.283 --> 02:00:26.152
OF THE DEMOCRATIC THAT DAY-

02:00:26.218 --> 02:00:28.688

02:00:28.754 --> 02:00:29.989
HOURS IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY

02:00:30.056 --> 02:00:34.093
OF FLOOR DEBATE- AND IT WAS

02:00:34.160 --> 02:00:38.931
DIFFICULT. I VOTED NO- THEN-

02:00:38.998 --> 02:00:41.000

BEFORE US TODAY- WHAT I SUPPORT

02:00:52.845 --> 02:00:54.246

PROBABLY WOULD AND- ALTHOUGH I

02:00:57.149 --> 02:01:00.753
VOTED NO AT THE AT THE TIME- I

02:01:00.820 --> 02:01:01.787
THINK THE QUESTION AND- AND

02:01:01.854 --> 02:01:02.855
MAYBE WE CAN TALK ABOUT THIS

02:01:02.922 --> 02:01:06.325

02:01:15.368 --> 02:01:17.503
ATTESTATION- I SEE IN THE

02:01:17.570 --> 02:01:18.337
ANALYSIS THAT EVEN THOUGH

02:01:18.404 --> 02:01:19.605
THERE'S NOT AN ATTESTATION

02:01:19.672 --> 02:01:20.339

THAT'S WHAT THE FIFTEEN DAY

02:02:25.871 --> 02:02:27.239
WHAT KIND OF SET OUT TO DO BUT

02:02:27.306 --> 02:02:29.008
WHAT WE HAVE FOUND IS THAT IT

02:02:29.075 --> 02:02:30.142
HAS BECOME A BARRIER FOR

02:02:30.209 --> 02:02:31.343
PEOPLE. AND I DON'T THINK THAT

02:02:31.410 --> 02:02:33.846
WAS EVER THE INTENTION OF THE

02:02:33.913 --> 02:02:35.347
FIFTEEN DAYS WAS A SAFEGUARD.

02:02:35.414 --> 02:02:36.415
BUT NOT THAT IT SERVES AS A

02:02:36.482 --> 02:02:40.219
BARRIER- THE DATA SHOWS US- AND

02:02:40.286 --> 02:02:41.687
THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT

02:02:41.754 --> 02:02:42.755
PUBLIC HEALTH COLLECTS THE DATA

02:02:42.822 --> 02:02:45.558

CARE SO IT'S NOT LIKE YOU KNOW

02:02:57.436 --> 02:02:58.904
IT'S NOT SOMETHING WHO WAKES UP

02:02:58.971 --> 02:02:59.905
PEOPLE LIKE TO GIVE THE

02:02:59.972 --> 02:03:01.006
IMPRESSION AS YOU WAKE UP ONE

02:03:01.073 --> 02:03:02.575

CHOICE AND TO MAKE CLEAR EVEN

02:38:24.528 --> 02:38:25.596
THOUGH THOSE PHARMACIES HAVE A

02:38:25.662 --> 02:38:27.898
CONTRACT WITH THOSE PHARMACY

02:38:27.965 --> 02:38:29.633
BENEFIT MANAGERS AND HEALTH

02:38:29.700 --> 02:38:30.100
PLANS TO PROVIDE THOSE

02:38:30.167 --> 02:38:33.003
SERVICES. SO THIS IS NOT ABOUT

02:38:33.070 --> 02:38:34.905
MAKING SURE THAT A CONSUMER CAN

02:38:34.972 --> 02:38:36.874
USE A PHARMACY THAT IS NOT IN

02:38:36.940 --> 02:38:38.675
THE PHARMACY IN THE PLAN'S

02:38:38.742 --> 02:38:40.110
NETWORK THESE ARE IN THE PLAN'S

02:38:40.177 --> 02:38:43.113
NETWORK EACH SIGN CONTRACTS. BE

02:38:43.180 --> 02:38:44.281
GOT CONSUMERS THE ENROLLEES

02:38:44.348 --> 02:38:45.382
HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT THEY HAVE

02:38:45.449 --> 02:38:47.918
ACCESS TO THAT AND THEN

02:38:47.985 --> 02:38:49.519
GENERALLY SPEAKING OUT OF THE

02:38:49.586 --> 02:38:50.921
BLUE AND WE HAVE PLENTY OF

02:38:50.988 --> 02:38:53.023
EVIDENCE THAT WE PROVIDED. A

02:38:53.090 --> 02:38:55.359
CONSUMERS TOLD THEY MUST GO TO

02:38:55.425 --> 02:38:56.627
A DIFFERENT PHARMACY WAR

02:38:56.693 --> 02:38:59.229
THERE'S A CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE

02:38:59.296 --> 02:39:00.797
FOR SOME REASON THAT PHARMACY

02:39:00.864 --> 02:39:03.567
IS NOT ALLOWED TO DISPENSE THAT

02:39:03.634 --> 02:39:05.068
DRUGS AND IF YOU WANTED FROM

02:39:05.135 --> 02:39:05.969
THAT PHARMACY THAT YOU'VE BEEN

02:39:06.036 --> 02:39:08.038
GOING TO FOR YEARS YOU'LL HAVE

02:39:08.105 --> 02:39:08.872
TO PAY OUT OF POCKET ONE

02:39:08.939 --> 02:39:11.174
HUNDRED PERCENT. YEAH WE KNOW

02:39:11.241 --> 02:39:13.510
THE PBMS HAVE. SAID THAT THIS

02:39:13.577 --> 02:39:16.713
BILL IS DENYING CONSUMER CHOICE

02:39:16.780 --> 02:39:18.315
AND THAT'S JUST NOT ACCURATE

02:39:18.382 --> 02:39:20.284
IT'S ACTUALLY THE OPPOSITE THAT

02:39:20.350 --> 02:39:23.053
PATIENCE. IS DENYING THE CHOICE

02:39:23.120 --> 02:39:25.822
BECAUSE IF IN FACT YOU ARE

02:39:25.889 --> 02:39:27.858
GIVEN NO CHOICE BUT TO GO

02:39:27.925 --> 02:39:30.060
SOMEWHERE ELSE EVEN THOUGH YOU

02:39:30.127 --> 02:39:32.229
HAVE A RIGHT BY CONTRACT. TO GO

02:39:32.296 --> 02:39:33.830
TO THE PHARMACY BEEN GOING TO

02:39:33.897 --> 02:39:35.799
THE CHOICE IS BEING DENIED BY

02:39:35.866 --> 02:39:39.036
THE PBM OR THE HEALTH PLAN. AND

02:39:39.102 --> 02:39:41.204
I THINK THAT THAT. WE REALLY

02:39:41.271 --> 02:39:44.274
BELIEVE THEY WANT TO CONTROL

02:39:44.341 --> 02:39:47.344
THE PHARMACEUTICAL DOLLAR- D.

02:39:47.411 --> 02:39:50.580
OWNERSHIP BY ONE ENTITY ABOARD

02:39:50.647 --> 02:39:53.817
A PBM AND A PHARMACY AND AN

02:39:53.884 --> 02:39:55.585
INFUSION PHARMACY AND EVEN

02:39:55.652 --> 02:39:57.220
HEALTH PLAN TOGETHER. AND THAT

02:39:57.287 --> 02:39:58.722
DOES EXIST IN THE MARKET THAT

02:39:58.789 --> 02:40:01.058
KIND OF CONTROL REALLY MAKES IT

02:40:01.124 --> 02:40:03.026
SO THEY WANT TO STEER THE

02:40:03.093 --> 02:40:05.062
PATIENT TO MAIL ORDER OR BRICK

02:40:05.128 --> 02:40:07.297
AND MORTAR DETAIL. AND THAT

02:40:07.364 --> 02:40:15.872
TAKES AWAY COMPETITION AS WELL.

02:40:15.939 --> 02:40:16.773
NOW SENATOR SKINNER SAID. IF

02:40:16.840 --> 02:40:18.675
THESE PHARMACY BENEFIT. AND

02:40:18.742 --> 02:40:20.777
HEALTH PLANS ONE THOSE CA. THEY

02:40:20.844 --> 02:40:22.145
CAN ALL THEM FINDING IT'S SUCH

02:40:22.212 --> 02:40:23.613
A REDUCTION IN OR LIVE OF A CO

02:40:23.680 --> 02:40:25.949
PAY- TO GO TO THAT FOR. THAT

02:40:26.016 --> 02:40:28.151
THERE TO THE TWO AMERICANS. IF

02:40:28.218 --> 02:40:30.887

THAT SPECIFICALLY IN THE BILL

02:40:34.758 --> 02:40:35.792
BUT IT HAS TO BE A DIRECT

02:40:35.859 --> 02:40:37.294
BENEFIT TO THE CONSUMER CAN'T

02:40:37.361 --> 02:40:40.864
BE AT THE REAL WE SAVE LOTS OF

02:40:40.931 --> 02:40:42.265
MONEY. BOB I THINK THAT THE

02:40:42.332 --> 02:40:45.502
OLDER. MARKET IS THAT. WE ARE

02:40:45.569 --> 02:40:46.570
BEING PUT IN A POSITION AS

02:40:46.636 --> 02:40:49.773
PHARMACISTS. TO NOT ONLY LOSE

THE OPPORTUNITY TO SERVE

02:40:51.675 --> 02:40:53.043
CUSTOMERS THAT WE BELIEVE WE

02:40:53.110 --> 02:40:54.578
ARE TIRED OF THE BY CONTRACT.

02:40:54.644 --> 02:40:56.113
WILL PUT IN A VERY DIFFICULT

02:40:56.179 --> 02:40:58.382

ORDER WHICH- CAN BE DEFINED FOR

02:41:07.224 --> 02:41:09.659
SOME- CONSUMERS BUT NOT FOR

NOBODY PREPARED TO TAKE ON THE

03:20:14.202 --> 03:20:15.403
DAY OF MY APPOINTMENT I LEARNED

03:20:15.470 --> 03:20:16.204
THAT UNDER MY COMMERCIAL

03:20:16.270 --> 03:20:17.872
INSURANCE POLICY. I WOULD NEED

03:20:17.939 --> 03:20:20.274
TO PAY SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS TO

03:20:21.309 --> 03:20:22.610
THE COST COMPLETELY BLINDSIDED

03:20:22.677 --> 03:20:24.345
ME. AND I CONTEMPLATED HOW I

03:20:24.412 --> 03:20:25.613

WOULD BE. FORCED TO MAKE AN

03:20:35.790 --> 03:20:37.191
IMPOSSIBLE DECISION THAT DAY

03:20:37.258 --> 03:20:38.726

03:45:03.256 --> 03:45:04.924
REPRESENTS A SMALL STEP IN THAT

03:45:04.991 --> 03:45:07.794
DIRECTION IT DOES TWO THINGS.

03:45:07.861 --> 03:45:08.728
FIRST THE BILL WOULD ADD

03:45:08.795 --> 03:45:10.096
DETAILS TO THE QUESTIONS

03:45:10.163 --> 03:45:12.098
HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS ASK THOSE

WHO TEST POSITIVE. SO THAT IT

03:45:14.133 --> 03:45:15.468
THE INFORMATION GATHERED WOULD

03:45:15.535 --> 03:45:17.337
BE MORE USEFUL IN STOPPING THE

03:45:17.403 --> 03:45:19.239
SPREAD OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE.

03:45:19.305 --> 03:45:20.340
AND SECOND THE BILL MAKES

03:45:20.406 --> 03:45:22.075
CHANGES TO AN EXISTING SYSTEM

03:45:22.141 --> 03:45:23.776
FOR SHARING DATA WITH BONA FIDE

SCIENTISTS CAN STUDY THE SPREAD

03:45:28.414 --> 03:45:29.549

03:45:29.616 --> 03:45:31.384
TIME. AND PROVIDE US WITH THE

03:45:31.451 --> 03:45:33.553
INFORMATION WE NEED TO MAKE

03:45:33.620 --> 03:45:35.488
INTELLIGENT DECISIONS. THIS

03:45:35.555 --> 03:45:36.656
BILL WOULD REQUIRE THE STATE TO

03:45:36.723 --> 03:45:38.091
CREATE A SPECIAL PANEL DURING

03:45:38.157 --> 03:45:40.393

03:45:40.460 --> 03:45:42.762

03:45:43.863 --> 03:45:45.732

03:45:45.798 --> 03:45:47.634
THIS EXPEDITED PROCESS ABIDE BY

03:45:47.700 --> 03:45:49.035
ALL OF THE EXISTING PRIVACY

03:45:49.102 --> 03:45:51.437
PROTECTIONS IN LAW. AND WE EVEN

03:45:51.504 --> 03:45:53.706
ADD SOME NEW ONES. THIS CAN BE

03:45:53.773 --> 03:45:55.074
DONE WHILE STILL BEING MINDFUL

03:45:55.141 --> 03:45:57.510

03:45:57.577 --> 03:46:00.246

TERRIBLE PANDEMIC BUT- YOU KNOW

FOR THE NEXT ONE. AND THIS BILL

03:46:12.392 --> 03:46:14.294

TREATING PEOPLE SOONER RATHER

04:13:00.031 --> 04:13:03.434

COST AND THINGS THAT COME DOWN

04:13:05.203 --> 04:13:07.539
