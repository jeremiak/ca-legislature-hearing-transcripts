OVERSIGHT HEARING OF THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY AND TOXIC MATERIALS. WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT A CHILDHOOD BLOOD LEAD TESTING. AND HOW DO AND. THIS IS JUST A THIS IS A REAL SERIOUS QUESTION THAT. THE COMMITTEE THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS JUST DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO WHICH IS. HOW CAN WE INSURE? THAT LOW INCOME CHILDREN ARE RECEIVING THE TESTING THAT'S. REQUIRED AND IS PAID FOR BY THE STATE FOR LEAD EXPOSURE. SO. WE'RE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND. IN MORE DETAIL HOW THE STATE HEALTH DEPARTMENTS TRACK CHILDREN ON THESE PROGRAMS SUCH AS MEDI CAL. TO ENSURE THEY RECEIVING THEIR BLOOD TEST. AS THEY ARE ARE REQUIRED TO DO. AND TO ENSURE THEY ARE RECEIVING THESE BLOOD LEAD TO HAVE TESTS IS THEY SHOULD. WE CAN'T SOLVE THE PROBLEM. WE CAN'T HELP THE KIDS. UNLESS THEY'RE TESTED. AND. BOB THAT PANELS CAN ADDRESS THIS ISSUE THE PUBLIC DATA WE SEEM SHOWS THAT ONLY ABOUT TWENTY EIGHT PERCENT OF THE CHILDREN ON MEDI CAL. I HAVE BEEN TESTED ANNUALLY FOR THE PAST FIVE YEARS. SO IS THAT DATA CORRECT AND IS THERE ANYTHING WE CAN DO TO MAKE IT BETTER. WE HAVE LONG KNOWN THAT LED IS HIGHLY TOXIC ESPECIALLY FOR KIDS AND THERE'S JUST NO SAFE LEVEL OF LEAD. CAUSES REAL. PERSONALITY DISORDERS THERE IS SOME SPECULATION THAT THE DECREASE IN CRIME. STARTED NINETIES I WAS DUE TO THE FACT THAT SO MUCH LEAD WAS TAKEN OUT OF THE ENVIRONMENT. NO ONE KNOWS IF THAT'S TRUE OR NOT. BUT THE FACT THAT YOU CAN EVEN MAKE THAT HYPOTHESIS. SHOWS THE DANGERS OF LAND IN BLOOD. A LETTER COURSE IS LISTED UNDER PROP SIXTY FIVE IS SUBSTANCE THAT CAN CAUSE REPRODUCTIVE DAMAGE. BIRTH DEFECTS. ARMED. LEAD EXPOSURE IN LEAD POISONING ARE ALSO ASSOCIATED WITH COGNITIVE ANOTHER HEALTH IMPACTS. ESPECIALLY TO CHILDREN AND THEY CAN BE A REVERSIBLE. MILLIONS OF CHILDREN ARE EXPOSED TO LEAD IN THEIR HOMES THROUGH LEAD PAINT. BUT THERE ARE OTHER SOURCES WELL YOU CAN JUST BE IN AN OLDER NEIGHBORHOOD AND WHILE YOUR HOUSE DOESN'T HAVE LEAD PAINT EDUCATION HOMES CAN. YOU CAN BE NEAR A HIGHWAY WHERE THERE WAS LOTS OF EXHAUST FROM CARS THAT HAD LEAD IN IT. ARM AND WE KNOW THAT IT CAN CAUSE PROBLEMS TO THE BRAIN SLOW GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT. LEARNING AND BEHAVIOR PROBLEMS HEARING AND SPEECH YOU PARAMOUNT. AND ALTHOUGH ALL KIDS ARE AT RISK PARTICULARLY THE KIDS ON MEDICARE HOW OF POOR AND MINORITY CHILDREN ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED NET HIGHEST RISK. AND IF ANY CHILD AT HIGH RISK GOES UNTESTED THAT CHILD WILL NOT RECEIVE THE. THE. SERVICES THAT THEY NEED SO THAT'S. BUT ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WERE WERE HOLDING THIS HEARING TODAY. WE'D LIKE TO BELIEVE THE STATE IS DOING EVERYTHING IT CAN TO ENSURE THOSE GOALS. SO AGAIN WE'RE GONNA BE LOOKING AT. HOW THE STATE IS ARE TRIED MAKING EFFORTS TO GET ALL CHILDREN TESTED? OUR I UNDERSTAND HOW THE CHILDREN ARE TRACKED FOR RECEIVING THOSE TASKS. AND UNDERSTAND WHAT IF ANY OBSTACLES MAY LIE IN THE WAY OF ACHIEVING STRUGGLE COMPLIANCE WITH THE MANDATE TO BLOOD LAST HIT. BLOOD LEAD TEST ALL LOW INCOME CHILDREN. SO I'D LIKE TO THANK THE WITNESSES WE HAVE TODAY. AND ALL THOSE WHO'VE TRAVELED TO OUR. HERE AS WELL. OUR I WOULD LIKE TO RECOGNIZE MY FIRST MY VICE CHAIR ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHEN. ART DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING THAT YOU'D LIKE TO SAY. ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHEN. IF YOU WANNA PRESSURE BUT NOT. I HAD THANK YOU FOR THE INFORMATION HEREIN LA QUARTZ SOON LEARN MORE ABOUT. LOOK WASN'T. ME TOO. AND THEN. ASSEMBLY MEMBER ELOISE GOMEZ REYES. CLEARLY THIS IS A TOPIC THAT IS SO IMPORTANT TO SOMEBODY IN THE COMMUNITY I COME FROM A COMMUNITY WHERE. THE POVERTY LEVEL IS VERY HIGH MANY OF MY CHILDREN ARE. MEDICAID RECIPIENTS WE KNOW THAT THE RULES REQUIRE TESTING AND I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO FINDING OUT. IF THEY ARE BEING TESTED AND IF THEY'RE NOT WHAT CAN WE DO TO FIX THAT. GREAT. ALRIGHT. SO IN PANEL LINE. I'D LIKE TO INVITE DOCTOR KAREN SMITH DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC HEALTH. A DOCTOR VICTORIA. CHARLTON CHIEF FOR THE. CHILDHOOD LEAD POISONING PREVENTION BRANCH. TO COME UP. ED TO THE STAND AND TO PROVIDE US WITH AN OVERVIEW OF HOW THAT DEPARTMENT TRACKS. THE BLOOD LEAD TESTING OF CHILDREN ENROLLED IN GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS. ARE SO PLEASED TO HAVE YOU BOTH THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR COMING. AND YOU CAN CERTAINLY HAVE UP TO THIRTY MINUTES FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. AND I HOPE THAT. WE CAN REALLY LEARN FROM YOU. WHAT THE EFFORTS ARE AND WHAT'S HAPPENING? I'D LIKE TO RECOGNIZE ONE OTHER ASSEMBLY MEMBER THAT HAS COME MAN. ASSEMBLY MEMBER AL MURATSUCHI. HE IS FROM TORRANCE AND IS THERE ANYTHING YOU PARTICULARLY WANTED TO. BRING UP TODAY. ALRIGHT AND. I MISS RAY S. IS THE THAT IS FROM SAN BERNADINE NOW I'M FROM HAYWARD. SO. WHICH REVIEW WOULD LIKE TO START FIRST. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS I'M DOCTOR KAREN SMITH I'M THE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH IN THE CALIFORNIA STATE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER. AND I'M GOING TO. PROVIDE A STATEMENT DR CHARLTON WHO'S A LITTLE UNDER THE WEATHER AND I ARE BOTH HERE TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS BUT SHE WILL BE PROVIDING YOU READ A STATEMENT. SO I AM. START AT THE CALIFORNIA CHILDHOOD LEAD POISONING PREVENTION PROGRAM IN THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH'S INTENDED TO WORK TO REDUCE THE INCIDENCE OF CHILDHOOD LEAD EXPOSURE IN CALIFORNIA. AND AS ESTABLISHED IN THE CALIFORNIA CHILDHOOD LEAD POISONING PREVENTION ACTS. PROGRAM. HAS WORKED WITH THE H. SEE US DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO PROMULGATE REGULATIONS THAT SPECIFY A STANDARD OF CARE FOR HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS REGARDING THE SCREENING AND ASSESSING FOR CHILDHOOD LEAD POISONING. THIS STANDARD OF CARE REQUIRES THAT CHILDREN WHO RECEIVE ASSISTANCE FROM PUBLICLY FUNDED PROGRAMS. FOR LOW INCOME CHILDREN SUCH AS MEDI CAL AND THE WOMEN INFANTS AND CHILDREN'S PROGRAM. OUR BLOOD TESTED FOR. AT BOTH AGE ONE AND TWO YEARS. THE DEPARTMENT GOES TO GREAT EFFORT TO ACHIEVE THIS LEVEL OF TESTING INCLUDING EXTENSIVE OUTREACH AND EDUCATION TO FAMILIES COMMUNITIES. CHILD CARE PROVIDERS AND HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS THROUGH MEDIA CAMPAIGNS THROUGH WORKING WITH LOCAL COMMUNITY GROUPS DIRECT MAILINGS OF MATERIALS CONFERENCES IN NUMEROUS PRECIPITATIONS. IN ADDITION TO WORKING TO ACHIEVE THIS UNIVERSAL TESTING REQUIRED BY STATUTE. THE PROGRAM ALSO PROVIDES CASE MANAGEMENT SERVICES TO CHILDREN WITH HIGH LEAD LEVELS. UNDER THE THE PROGRAM DEVELOPED REGULATIONS HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS MUST PROVIDE GUIDANCE ABOUT PREVENTING LEAD EXPOSURE TO ALL FAMILIES OF YOUNG CHILDREN DURING THEIR PRETEEN HEALTH CARE VISITS. BETWEEN THE AGES OF SIX AND SEVENTY TWO MONTHS OR SIX MONTHS IN SIX YEARS. THIS REQUIREMENT IS NOT LIMITED TO THE PUBLICLY FUNDED TO CHILDREN WHO ARE IN PUBLICLY FUNDED PROGRAMS FOR LOW INCOME CHILDREN. CHILDREN WHO DO RESEARCH THAT SERVICES FROM PUBLICLY FUNDED PROGRAM ARE REQUIRED TO BE BLOOD LEAD TESTED AT AGE TWELVE AND TWENTY FOUR MONTHS. CHILDREN WHOSE HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS DETERMINE THAT THOUGHT MANDATORY TESTING WAS NOT DONE AT THOSE AGES ARE REQUIRED TO TEST AT SOME POINT DURING UP TO SEVENTY TWO MONTHS. THE CITY PITCH CHILDHOOD LEAD PROGRAM FOCUSES OUR OUT REACH IN PRIORITIZING CHILDREN WHO ARE AT INCREASED RISK FOR LEAD EXPOSURE. AND THOSE INCLUDE CHILDREN WHO ARE PRIMARILY FROM LOW INCOME FAMILIES INCLUDING THOSE WHO RECEIVE ASSISTANCE FROM PUBLICLY FUNDED PROGRAMS. BUT ALSO THOSE WHO LIVE IN DETERIORATED DETERIORATED OR RECENTLY RENOVATED OLDER HOUSING BECAUSE OF THE LIKELIHOOD OF LEAD BASED PAINT OR LED TO CONTAMINATED DUST AND SOIL BEING PRESENT. HOWEVER CHILDREN OF ANY BACKGROUND IN AGE MAY BE BLOOD BLOOD TESTED AND IF THE HEALTH CARE PROVIDER OR FAMILY BELIEVES THAT CIRCUMSTANCES PUT THEM AT RISK. ALL CHILDREN IDENTIFIED TO HAVE AS HAVING INCREASED BLOOD LEAD LEVELS ARE ELIGIBLE FOR SERVICES. FROM THE CALIFORNIA LED PROGRAM. REGARDLESS OF THEIR DOCUMENTATION STATUS AND REGARDLESS OF FAMILY INCOME. TO ENCOURAGE COMPLIANCE WITH THE STANDARD OF CARE FOR SCREENING FOR CHILDHOOD LEAD POISONING CITY PH CARRIES OUT EXTENSIVE OUTREACH TO HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS AND HEALTH PROGRAMS. THIS OUT REACHES CONDUCTED BY BIG BY OUR CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. CHILDHOOD LEAD PREVENTION PROGRAM BRANCH WHICH WE LIKE TO CALL CLIP FIRST FOR A SHORT MRS SAKE. AND ALSO BY STATE SUPPORTED LOCAL CLIP PROGRAMS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. TO INCREASE COMPLIANCE BY MEDICAL PROVIDERS WITH MANDATED SCREENING. A CLIP PUBLIC HEALTH MEDICAL OFFICER PROVIDES IN PERSON PRESENTATIONS TO PHYSICIANS AND MIDDLE THE MID LEVEL PROVIDERS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. THESE PRESENTATIONS PROVIDE INFORMATION ON THE AFFECTS OF BLOOD LED SCREENING IN MANAGEMENT OF LEAD EXPOSED CHILDREN AND INFORM PROVIDERS ABOUT THE STATE REGULATIONS REGARDING CHILDHOOD LEAD TESTING. PRESENTATIONS ARE GIVEN OUT MEETINGS CONFERENCES ONE TWO ONE IN MEDICAL OFFICES MEDICAL RESIDENCY PROGRAMS AS WELL AS AT HOSPITALS. AND A TO CLINIC STAFF DEPARTMENT AND HOSPITAL WIDE PRISON TITIAN'S. WE ALSO HAVE A FREE CONTINUING MEDICAL EDUCATION OR SEE A ME. PROGRAM THAT IS SIMILAR TO THE IN PERSON PRESENTATIONS CONTINUOUSLY AVAILABLE ON OUR WEBSITE. AS WELL AS BEING UP ON THE CME THAT CALIFORNIA WEBSITE. FROM THE MEDICAL BOARD. IN ADDITION PUBLIC OF NURSES IN THE LOCAL CLICK PROGRAMS PROVIDE DIRECT OUTREACH MEDICAL PROVIDERS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. DURING THE FIRST HALF OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN FIVE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX OUTREACH AND EDUCATION EVENTS OCCURRED AND REACHING ALMOST TEN THOUSAND PROVIDERS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE ALSO HAVE OUTREACH MATERIALS THAT ARE MADE AVAILABLE TO HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS ALWAYS IN SPANISH AND ENGLISH AND MANY OF THE MATERIALS ARE ALSO PRODUCED. IN EIGHTEEN OTHER LANGUAGES. IN ADDITION TO KEY DOCUMENTS THE CALIFORNIA MANAGEMENT GUIDELINES ON CHILDHOOD LEAD POISONING FOR HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS AND THE STANDARD OF CARE GUIDELINES ON CHILDHOOD LEAD POISONING FOR CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS. ARE SENT TO HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. PUBLICATIONS AND ARTICLES REGARDING CHILDHOOD LEAD POISONING PREVENTION AND BLOOD LEAD TESTING REQUIREMENTS ARE PUBLISHED IN THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL BOARD NEWSLETTER AND OTHER PUBLICATIONS FOR MEDICAL PROVIDERS. ANY CHILD IDENTIFIED AS A CONFIRMED CASE OF LEAD POISONING WILL RECEIVE PUBLIC HEALTH NURSING AND ENVIRONMENTAL FOLLOW UP AND CASE MANAGEMENT. PUBLIC HEALTH NURSES AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROFESSIONALS MAKE HOME VISITS TO EDUCATE THE FAMILY ABOUT HOW TO REDUCE THE LEAD EXPOSURE. AND CARRY OUT INTER INTERVIEWS REGARDING PRODUCTS IN USE AT THE HOME A HOW TO AND REDUCING LEAD EXPOSURE. AND FAMILY BEHAVIORS AND THEY ALSO CONDUCT INSPECTIONS OF THE PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT INCLUDING THE HOUSE AND SURROUNDINGS. HOME INVESTIGATIONS INCLUDE TESTING PAINT DUST SOIL AND WATER FOR LED AND OFTEN INCLUDE ACTUALLY FLUORESCENT EVALUATIONS OF LEAD IN AND AROUND THE HOUSE HOME. TIM WITH A HAND HELD DEVICE THAT PROVIDES IMMEDIATE FEEDBACK TO THE FAMILY. THE CHILD RECEIVE SPECIAL HEALTH CARE REFERRALS AS NEEDED AN ONGOING COLLABORATION BETWEEN PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE CHILD'S HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS DIRECTLY. FOLLOW UP IS CARRIED OUT TO ASSURE THAT THE SOURCES OF LEAD IN THE HOME ARE IDENTIFIED AND REMOVED AND TO ENSURE THAT THE BLOOD LEAD LEVELS IN THE CHILDREN DECLINE AND REMAIN LOW. CITY PITCHES CLIP BRANCH WORKS IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE CHILDHOOD HEALTH AND DISABILITIES PROGRAM IN THE DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES. TO PROMOTE BLOOD LEAD TESTING THROUGHOUT REACHED A HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS. CLIP NCH DP JOINTLY ISSUE THE HEALTH ASSESSMENT GUIDELINES FOR MEDICAL PROVIDERS AND SCREENING FOR LEAD EXPOSURE AND MANAGING CHILDREN IDENTIFIED WITH INCREASED BLOOD LEVELS THESE GUIDELINES ARE SENT TO HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA AND WERE UPDATED BY CH DP AND CLIP. AND REISSUED IN SEPTEMBER OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN. GUIDELINES ARE ALSO AVAILABLE ON THE C. HTP WEBSITE AS WELL AS OUR WEBSITE AT CTP AGE AND ARE ALSO AVAILABLE AND HARD COPY TWO PAGE HANDOUT. SO THAT CONCLUDES MY STATEMENT WE'RE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE. SO I THINK YOU A DOCTOR SMITH AND I'M SORRY YOUR VOICES NAM CHALLENGE TODAY DOCTOR. A CHARLATAN. SO YOU'RE CLEARLY DOING A LOT OF WORK. IS FIRST FALL IS THE NUMBER TWENTY EIGHT PERCENT. WHICH IS THE ONLY PUBLIC NUMBER WE HAD FOR THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR. REIMBURSEMENT UNDER MEDI CAL AND BLACK TWENTY EIGHT PERCENT OF THEM BEING TESTED IS THAT DO YOU THINK A GOOD NUMBER. SO I DON'T WE DON'T HAVE GOOD MEANING AT ACCURATE IDEA BECAUSE TO THINK NOW WE ALL AGREE IT WOULDN'T BE GOOD IF ONLY TWENTY EIGHT PERCENT AT HOW ACCURATE IS THAT NUMBER SO I'M GOING TO DEFER QUESTIONS AT THAT THAT RELY ON MEDI CAL DATA TO. MY COLLEAGUE JENNIFER CAN'T BECAUSE I DON'T REALLY WE DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THE MEDICAL DATA WHAT I CAN TELL YOU IS THAT. WHAT VOTE CALIFORNIA LED PREVENTION PROGRAM POISONING PREVENTION PROGRAM HAS DONE IN THE PAST? IS A MANUAL ASSESSMENT OF. ARE OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF THE PERCENTAGE OF LOW INCOME CHILDREN IN CALIFORNIA THAT HAVE BEEN TESTED. WE'VE DONE THIS BY. USING U. S. CENSUS DATA TO ESTIMATE THAT THERE APPROXIMATELY A MILLION CHILDREN IN CALIFORNIA BETWEEN THE AGES OF ONE AND TWO SO THAT'S THE POPULATION. OVER ALL WITH WHO ARE I'M AT OR BELOW TWO HUNDRED FIFTY PERCENT OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL TO THAT'S THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN THAT WE WOULD EXPECT TO HAVE TESTED. IF AT THE SAME TIME WE IF WE LOOK AT THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN WHO WERE LED TESTED IN CALIFORNIA WHAT WE SEE IS APPROXIMATELY SEVENTY TWO PERCENT. OF THE CHILDREN THAT WE HAVE THAT NUMBER THAT WE EXPECT TO BE HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN TESTED AT LEAST ONCE. AND. DR CHARLTON WLL CORRECT ME IF I MAKE ANY MISSTATEMENTS ABOUT THOSE SO THAT WE DON'T BE BECAUSE. LEVEL OF INCOME IS NOT AN IT BAG COLLECTED WITH FOR THE CHILDHOOD LEAD POISONING PREVENTION DATA WE GOT. WITH ELECTRONIC LAB REPORTING OF ALL LEAD TESTING DONE IN CALIFORNIA ALL AGES INCLUDING ALL CHILDREN. HOWEVER THE INCOME THE FAMILY INCOME LEVEL IS NOT ONE OF THE PIECES OF DATA THAT'S COLLECTED. SO WE'VE USED THIS. SURROGATE METHOD FOR ESTIMATING THAT THE PERCENTAGE OF TESTING THAT'S HOW BOOK OKAY BUT HOW MANY TOTAL CHILDREN ARE THERE. ARE. BETWEEN THE AGES OF ARE SIX MONTHS AND SIX YEARS. THERE WERE ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND CHILDREN BORN IN CALIFORNIA EVERY YEAR. IT'S DROPPED A LITTLE OVER THE OKAY RETAILERS THAT WOULD BE ABOUT A MILLION TOTAL CHILDREN. AGE TWO AND THREE. AND I'M WE HAD ESTIMATED AT TWENTY FIFTY PERCENT OF POVERTY LEVEL THAT THERE'S ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTY THOUSAND SUCH CHILDREN. AND WE GET OUR. BLOOD LEAD TEST RESULTS ELECTRONICALLY FROM THE LABS SO WE GET INDIVIDUAL REPORTS AND THE CHILDREN WERE TESTED. OKAY SO THIS FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTY THOUSAND CHILDREN AND THEN HOW MANY ACTUAL TESTS ARE DONE ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED AND NINE THOUSAND WOULD INCLUDE. CHILDREN AGE NINE MONTHS TO TWELVE MONTHS BECAUSE SOME CHILDREN GET THEIR ONE YEAR VISIT IN A FEW MONTHS BEFORE. AND THEN ABOUT THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY THOUSAND CHILDREN AGED TWO AND THREE. SHOW WHEN WE COMPARE THOSE WE'RE ENDING UP WITH A. AS WAS SAID AYE AYE NUMBER IN THE MID SEVENTIES FOR CHILDREN WHAT WE BELIEVE ARE GETTING TEST. BUT. THAT'S ASSUMING THAT ALL THE CHILDREN GETTING TESTED ARE LOW INCOME. SO AND THAT'S OUR TARGETED GROUP AS WITH EXPLAIN WHY AND WHEN WE LOOK AT CASES CHILDREN WHO HAVE VERY HIGH BLOOD LEAD LEVEL TO GET THE. CASE SERVICES THAT DOCTOR SMITH EXPLAINED ABOUT EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT OF THEM ARE MEDI CAL. SHOW YOU COULD NOT BELIEVE THAT AND AND MOVE IT DOWN. AND THEN ALSO SOME CHILDREN GET A TEST AFTER TO THAT MAKE UP TEST SO THEY MAY BE. THREE AND A HALF OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. TOGETHER TO WE BELIEVE A CONSIDERABLY MORE CHILDREN ARE BEING TESTED THEM THAT TWENTY EIGHT PERCENT WOULD INDICATE. OKAY ARM. I. CERTAINLY. AND PREPS I CAN ASK MY STAFF JUST TO QUESTION THIRD DOWN RIGHT I'LL GET SO I'M JUST NOT SURE I BELIEVE YOUR NUMBERS. AYE BUT I'D ONE WILL WILL HAVE WILL TRY AND GO TO IT. THOSE EXTRAPOLATIONS ARE REALLY DEPENDING UPON. THE FACT THAT. WELL FOR EXAMPLE I COULD BELIEVE THAT. THERE IS A LESS OF A CHANCE OF HIGHER INCOME PEOPLE. LIVING IN HOMES THAT HAVE LED PROBLEMS AND IF FOR SOME REASON THEY WERE GETTING TESTED AT A HIGH RATE YOU CAN. UNDERESTIMATE THE NUMBER WHERE IS THE NUMBER WE'RE GETTING FROM MEDICAL DATA IS I THINK MORE HARD DATA BUT. I WILL ADMIT TO BEING CONFUSED. AND I MENTIONED WE DID IT WAS A FEW YEARS BACK. TO AN ACTUAL MATCH I'M GETS CHILDREN WHO AND MEDI CAL TALK COULD FIND AND LOOK. AT WHETHER WE COULD FIND THEM BETWEEN AGE NINE MONTHS AND TWENTY SEVEN MONTHS IN OUR DATABASE. OF CHILDREN SHOWING UP FOR SERVICES AT MEDICO. WE GOT ABOUT THE SAME ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE SEVENTY SEVEN PERCENT OF CHILDREN WERE GETTING AT LEAST ONE BUT LET TEST. AND FOR CHILDREN THAT WE COULDN'T DOCUMENT ANY OTHER MEDICAL SERVICES WE WERE GETTING SIXTY. THREE PERCENT CHAU SO CLEARLY WE ALL NEED TO TO TRY AND FIGURE OUT WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE MARIN. WELL EVEN IF IT'S SEVENTY SOME PERCENT THEN THERE'S TWENTY FIVE PERCENT WHO AREN'T. UP. WHAT OTHER THINGS FOR THE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN TWENTY FIVE PERCENT AND SEVENTY PERCENT THAT AREN'T BEING TESTED? UP WHERE WHERE WE LOSING PEOPLE. SO. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WE DON'T KNOW BUT I'M NOT SAID I THINK THAT THE MOST LIKELY IT LIKELY IS THE THE SAME POPULATION THAT WE ARE NOT REACHING IN OTHER WAYS TO THOSE WHO ARE NOT ACTIVELY ENGAGING IN ANY SERVICE SO WHETHER IT'S. A WOMEN IT'S FOR INFANTS AND CHILDREN BUT THEY'RE ALSO NOT ACCESSING HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS GETTING SERVICES IN FREE CLINICS ETCETERA SO THERE'S A LARGE POPULATION OF PEOPLE PARTICULARLY. OF RECENT IMMIGRANTS WHO DON'T ACTUALLY. ENGAGE IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR VERY MUCH AT ALL AND IT MAY BE THAT A PORTION OF THOSE CHILDREN. ARE THERE I'M NOT SURE AS FAR AS. THE THE MEDI CAL POPULATION PER SE. I'M NOT REALLY FAMILIAR WITH THE MEDICAL DATA AND SO I THINK I WOULD I ONCE AGAIN REFER TO MISS KENT ON THAT. OKAY. WHAT WOULD YOU SUGGEST A BE DONE TO GET? THE KIDS WHO ARE BEING TESTED DOES THAT MEAN WE NEED TO DO MORE WITH FREE CLINICS OR. I THINK THAT M. INNER SPIRIT I'VE WORKED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL FOR TEN YEARS BEFORE COMING TO THE STATE AND I WILL SAY THAT THE. YOU SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE CHILDHOOD LEAD PREVENTION PROGRAM AND AND I I DO ACTUALLY HAVE SOME EXPERIENCE WITH THE CHILD HEALTH AND DISABILITY PROGRAM. THEY WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH WITH CLINICS PARTICULARLY FQHCS AND OTHER. CLINICS IN COMMUNITIES THAT REALLY REACH THESE MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS AND THEY DO A VERY GOOD JOB OF MAKING THE CLINICIANS AWARE OF LEAD TESTING. THERE ARE SOME BARRIERS BUT THERE ARE BARRIERS WITHIN THE SYSTEM SO FOR EXAMPLE. IN MANY CLINICS POINT OF CARE LEAD TESTING SO THE KIND OF TESTING OR MUNICIPALITY. A SMALL TEST AT WHAT SITES ARE NOT AVAILABLE AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT THAT FAMILY THEN HAS TO GO TO A BLOOD COLLECTION SITE ACTUALLY STAY GET THE TOSSED THEY MAY HAVE TO PAY A CO PAY. AND THE EACH STEP REMOVED THAT YOU ARE IS A STEP THAT CREATES A BARRIER AND THAT'S TRUE FOR ANY KIND OF. TESTING THAT REQUIRES A BLOOD DRAW AND THAT MAY BE ONE OF THE AREAS WERE RELEASING SOME CHILDREN AS WELL. SO ARM WOULD YOU SUGGEST IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA IF WE COULD DO AT LEAST A SCREENING TEST WHEN THE CHILDREN ARE GETTING THEIR CHECKUPS. I YOU KNOW IT TO PI DON'T KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT THE STATE OF THE ART OF POINT OF CARE LEAD TESTING THERE HAVE BEEN THERE ARE TECHNOLOGIES AVAILABLE MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THEY ARE IN FACT. SOME ARE DEVELOPING IN THAT. RECENTLY THAT WAS OF SOME OF THE TECHNOLOGY THAT'S AVAILABLE HAS ACTUALLY BEEN CALLED INTO QUESTION AS FAR OF ITS AS FAR AS ITS ACCURACY GOES IN AND SO WITHOUT MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE TECHNOLOGY THAT'S AVAILABLE I WOULD HESITATE. HESITATE TO CALL FOR A BROAD ADOPTION OF POINT OF CARE TESTING COULD YOU GIVE US MORE INFORMATION AND. AND PERHAPS WEEK WE KEEP THE RECORD OPEN FOR A MONTH. IF SOMEONE IN YOUR DEPARTMENT COULD GET THIS INFORMATION. ABOUT HOW THE ACCURACY OF THESE TASKS AND THE COST ARE PERHAPS WE COULD LOOK AT MAKING IT AVAILABLE PARTICULARLY TO. TO LEARN COMMUNITIES IN PROVIDERS WHO GET A LOT OF MEDI CAL AND WAKES CHILDREN. WE CAN PROVIDE THAT WE TO HAPPY TO PROVIDE BUT I MIGHT JUST WANT TO MENTION. THE POINT OF SOME OF CARE. SYSTEM THAT EXISTS NOW WHICH WAS BUILT WITH THE CDC WAS MEANT TO BE ACCURATE AROUND TEN. WHICH WE ALL KNOW NOW IS NOT. THE IDEAL LEVEL TO LOOK AT LED WE'RE ALL GOING MUCH LOWER I'M IT IS ACCURATE ABOUT THREE POINT THREE. IT'S REALLY PUSHING UP AGAIN. LEVELS OF ACCURACY THAT JUST WAS A BIG RECALL. I'M OF THE SYSTEM BECAUSE WITH VENOUS BLOOD TEST. PEOPLE USING* TELL SUPPOSED TO CAPILLARY THEY WERE UNDER READING. ROOM SO THERE'S A LOT GOING ON AROUND THAT BUT WE HAVE BE HAPPY TO GET YOU OUT AND. CAN BE WONDERFUL THANK YOU. ALRIGHT AYE AYE YEAH YES ARE SO. OF MR CHEN IS VICE CHAIR YOU CAN GO NEXT I KNOW MISS. REYES HAS A QUESTION. AND THEN IF MR SCHUMER'S SUCI AS A QUESTION GO RIGHT AHEAD. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR PRECIADO TIME. MY QUESTIONS IN THE AREA OF LEAD PAINT SPECIFICALLY INCREASE IN TERMS OF WHAT HAVE WE DONE THE STATE LEVEL TO WORK WITH A FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES. UNDERSTAND THAT EVERY COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH THROUGHOUT OUR STATE HAS THROWN INDIVIDUAL PUBLIC HEALTH PROGRAM. THAT COMMENTS IS AREA A WHAT HAVE WE DONE TO CLAPPER WOULD COLLABORATE WITH THEM. MY SECOND QUESTION IS. HAVE WE SEEN. IT INFLUX OF MORE OF THESE LEAD PAINT ISSUES IN AREAS IN WHICH OR FROM LOWER SOCIO ECONOMIC LEVELS AND HOW MUCH OF THAT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY IN THE ONUS ON. THE RESIDENT. NATURAL WEAR AND TEAR ON THEM BREATHING THEN BREATHING IN A LEAD PAINT BY EATING LEAD PAINT CHIPS. AND WHAT HAVE WE DONE TO TRY TO COMBAT THESE ISSUES. SO I'M. THE. THE DEPARTMENT PROVIDES FUNDING TO. FIFTY CONTRACT IT WELL WERE FORTY EIGHT COUNTIES CONTRACT WITH US CURRENTLY TWO WERE IN THE PROCESS OF COMPLETING THE CONTRACTS. TO ACTUALLY DO BOTH THE CASE MANAGEMENT OF THE INDIVIDUAL CHILDREN HERE. ARE DETECTED IS HAVING HIGH LEAD LEVELS BUT THEN ALSO TO DO ENVIRONMENTAL SURVEY FOUND WE SEND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS IN TWO TO SURVEY AND THEN. DIRECT REMEDIATION AS FAR AS. WHOSE RESPONSIBILITY IT IS WHETHER IT IF IT'S AN OWNER IT'S CLEAR THAT THE RESPONSIBILITY IS. ON THE OWNER. I I WOULD NOT I AM NOT AN EXPERT IN THE LAW AND I KNOW THAT THESE ISSUES WITH BETWEEN TENANTS AND OWNERS IN RENTAL SITUATIONS CAN BECOME EXTREMELY CAN. YES AND I DON'T REALLY HAVE. THE EXPERTISE TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION. ON WELL BUT WE AND WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH THE LOCAL I JURISDICTIONS AND ALL THE AND IN THOSE COUNTIES WHERE WE DO NOT DIRECTLY CONTRACT WITH THE COUNTY. THEY THE DEPARTMENT PROVIDES THOSE SERVICES IN SOME COUNTIES TO PROVIDE THEM IN COLLABORATION WITH THE WITH THE. COUNTY BUT WE IN OTHER COUNTIES ARE NURSES AND OUR ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS DO THE WORK DIRECTLY. OKAY. ANYTHING ELSE. ASSEMBLYMEMBER REYES. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. BUT I'D LIKE TO GO BACK TO THE STATISTICS BECAUSE IT'S CLEAR FROM YOUR PRESENTATION THAT ONCE THE CHILD HAS BEEN TESTED HAS BEEN FOUND TO HAVE LED. THEN CLEARLY THERE ARE NUMBER SERVICES ARE PROVIDED TO THE CHILD TO THE FAMILY. AND. SERVICES TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE NO LONGER EXPOSE AND THAT OF THE CHILDREN NOT EXPOSED TO THE LAND. BUT I AM VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN WHO ARE ACTUALLY TESTED. AND I DO KNOW THAT THAT THE NUMBERS THAT WERE REFERRED TO. COME FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. AND THEY DID TALK ABOUT THE IF IT IN HERE. FIT FEDERAL FISCAL YEAR TWO THOUSAND TWELVE THROUGH THROUGH TWO THOUSAND SIX TEAM. THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN AGES ONE. TO. WHO HAD BEEN CONTINUOUSLY IN A CONTINUOUSLY ENROLLED IN MEDICARE EL? WHO WERE TESTED VERSUS THOSE WHO ARE CONTINUOUSLY ENROLLED IN MEDICARE WILL? THE NUMBERS ARE VERY DIFFERENT. FOR TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THE NUMBER TESTED WERE TWO HUNDRED TWENTY ONE THOUSAND. THE NUMBER AND ROLLED WERE SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY SEVEN GIVING US A TWENTY EIGHT POINT ONE PERCENT. THAT WERE ACTUALLY TESTED. SO AGAIN I AM WHERE WERE WE. I'M GONNA DEFER TO. JEN CAN'T WE DEAL WITH I'M THE ACTUAL LABORATORY TESTS SO WE HAVE THE END OF THE PROCESS I'M RATHER THAN WHAT WE'RE WHICH. HEALTH INSURER THE CHILD IS IS SADDAM IS INSURED BY. WHAT EVERY SINGLE LABORATORY TEST DONE FOR LOUD FOR EVERYONE IN CALIFORNIA COMES THROUGH OUR? SYSTEM AND SO WHEN WE MET WHEN WE MAKE ESTIMATES AND THEY ARE ESTIMATES AGAIN WE DON'T GOT FAMILY INCOME LEVEL. WE USE WHAT WE HAVE FROM CENSUS DATA AND THE NUMBER OF SO WE MAKE AN ESTIMATE OF WHAT THE TOTAL POPULATION IS USING U. S. CENSUS DATA. AND WE KNOW HOW MANY. SAMPLES WE RECEIVE FROM KIDS IN THE APPROPRIATE AGE RANGE AND THAT'S HOW WE MAKE OUR ESTIMATES OF THE NUMBER OF ANTICIPATED CHILDREN IN POVERTY IN CALIFORNIA UNDER TWO HUNDRED FIFTY PERCENT OF PART OF. THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL ARE BEING TESTED AND IT'S BASED ON LEAD TEST RESULTS. I DON'T I DON'T. REALLY HAVE I NEITHER HAVE ACCESS TO NOR UNDERSTAND THE MEDICAL DATA. SO I WILL I KNOW THAT. THIS KENSHIN TENDS TO TALK ABOUT IT AND IF I COULD CLARIFY. OUR NUMBERS ARE INDIVIDUAL CHILDREN TESTED. SO IF A CHILD GETS TO BLOOD BLOOD TESTS THAT WERE ONLY COUNTING THEM ONCE. SO IT'S A D. DUPLICATED INFORMATION. THE PROCESS THAT WE DO MANUALLY. SO THE QUESTION IS THEN SHOULD BE REFERRED TO NEXT HANNAFORD CAN'T CONCERT. ULTIMATELY I THINK THAT. IF IF WE HAD DATA SYSTEMS THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO TO ACTUALLY DIRECTLY. OUT COMPARED THE MEDICAL DATA AND YOU KNOW SORT OF. REALLY. RUN ANALYSES ON THE TWO SYSTEMS TOGETHER WE WOULD BE ABLE TO PROVIDE MUCH MORE. ACCURATE DATA RATHER THAN ESTIMATING BUT AT THIS TIME WE JUST DON'T HAVE THAT TECHNOLOGY. WOULD YOU AGREE THAT. THAT IT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TEST CHILDREN. FOR LED ABSOLUTELY AND WOULD YOU AGREE THAT THE CHILDREN FROM LOW INCOME THAT THE COME FROM LOW INCOME FAMILIES. ARE AT A HIGHER RISK OF LEAD POISONING YES THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE PRIORITIZE THAT POPULATION AND I THINK THAT IT EL ALONG THOSE LINES THEM TO THE CHILDREN THAT ARE LOW INCOME. ARE USUALLY ON MEDI CAL AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE THE REQUIREMENT THEM THAT THEY BE TESTED. WE AGREE YES SHOULD THEY BE TESTED ONCE OR SHOULD THINK THEY BE TESTED MORE THAN ONCE WELL THE REQUIREMENT IS FORTY. FOR TESTING BOTH A AT SIX MONTHS AND AT TWELVE MONTHS AND SO DOT DOT IS WHAT OUR RECOMMENDATION WOULD BE. VERY GOOD. PART OF THE REASON THAT THAT OF A FOR MY GREAT INTEREST AS. CHAIRMAN KNOWS I I DID INTRODUCE AB TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE WE WERE FINDING THAT MANY OF OUR CHILDREN. WERE NOT BEING TESTED. EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE IT WAS REQUIRED THAT THE THAT THEY BE TESTED WE'RE FINDING BECAUSE OF THE STATISTICS THAT WAS NOT HAPPENING. AND IF I COULD MAKE ONE MORE COMMENT. OUR NUMBER IS PROBABLY A LOW NUMBER. BECAUSE WHAT OUR NUMBERS ARE AS THE BLOOD LEAD TESTS THAT ARE REPORTED TO US. SO IF THERE'S ANY ABSENCE OF REPORTING OR ANY PATCHES THAT'S NOT REPORTED ARE ARE NUMBERS WOULD BE YOU KNOW SO IN OTHER WORDS A RATHER THAN IT BEING OVERESTIMATE. I WOULD THINK IT TENDS TO BE A LITTLE BIT OF LOVE. WELL WE ALL AGREE THEIR CHILDREN YOU SHOULD BE TESTED WHO ARE NOT SELL THAT THAT WE CAN AGREE ON. I AND THE. OTHER ANY OTHER QUESTIONS BEFORE I STE AYE I HAVE I ALWAYS HAVE MORE QUESTIONS. IT DEPICTED GEOGRAPHICAL DATA WHEN YOU GET THE RESULTS OF THE TEST AND YES WE DO. BUT I WATCHED CHICAGO DATA WHOM WE HAVE ADDRESS DATA WE HAVE TO FOLLOW THESE CHILDREN SO WE WE AND CHECK IT OUT TRUST INTO FARM IT DOESN'T ALLOW YOU TO FIND. NEIGHBORHOODS THAT ARE PARTICULARLY. IN DANGER OF HAVING THAT CHILDREN WITH HIGH LEFT. IN A WITH THE APPROPRIATE DATA SYSTEMS WE DO DO GEO MAPPING WE COULD DO JAIL MAPPING I DON'T KNOW JUST THE SYSTEM A LOT. AND WE DO HAVE DONE ZIP CODE. AREAS IT'S ACTUALLY POSTED ON OUR WEBSITE TO SHOW THE ZIP CODES THAT HAVE A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF VERY GOOD CHILDREN THAT THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN. I'M INCREASED. BUT. WITH ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND BLOOD LEAD TEST COMING IN EACH YEAR. AND. SOME OF THESE TESTS ABOUT FIFTEEN PERCENT OR SO LACK COMPLETE ADDRESSES SO WE HAVE TO WORK WITH THE LAB TO GET IT. SOME OF THE MAPPING IT IS NOT SO ACCURATE FOR THE DENOMINATOR SO WITHIN MY BLOOD LEAD LEVEL WE WORK REALLY HARD TO FIND THAT CHILD TO GET SERVICES. BUT IT'S A VERY LOW BLOOD LEAD LEVEL THAT WOULD JUST BE THE DENOMINATOR CHILDREN TESTED IN THAT AREA. IT THEY THEY MAY NOT QUITE GET THE. THE THE RESEARCH ATTENTION BUT WE'RE WORKING ON IT AND. A GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEM IS PART OF WHAT WE'RE DEVELOPING WITH OUR DATABASE NOW. SO THAT'S EXCELLENT BECAUSE WHO WOULD BE VERY GOOD IF WE COULD LET PEDIATRICIANS NO. ARE WHAT AREAS THEY SHOULD PARTICULARLY LOOK OUT FOR. ALRIGHT ALAMEDA COUNTY HAVE ONE MORE QUESTION. SO ARM YOU HAVE THIS THEIR BLOOD LEVEL TRACKING SYSTEM ARE RASCAL. AND THAT HOW WAS THAT. PROGRAM COMING ALONG WENDY THINK KILL HAVE. OF IMPROVE DATABASE SO CHAU RASCAL WHICH STANDS FOR THE RESPONSE AND SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM FOR CHILD AND LEAD EXPOSURE. MAYBE MORE THAN YOU WANTED TO KNOW. WAS THAT A DATA SYSTEM THAT WAS DEVELOPED ALMOST TWENTY YEARS AGO. AND RECEIVES ALL THE BLOOD THE TEST WE'VE TALKED ABOUT GETS INFORMATION ABOUT CASES DETECTOR. SO WE ARE LOOKING NOW AT IT UPGRADING IT TO MODERN TECHNOLOGY AND TO DO THESE THINGS WE TALKED ABOUT. THE NEW SYSTEMS CAN BE CALLED SHIELD. I'M JUST TO DISTINGUISH AT ITS SERVE SURVEILLANCE HEALTH ENVIRONMENTAL INVESTIGATION AND LEAD DATABASE JUST THE SEC. AND THEN I'M AS AN ASIDE I WILL ALSO SAY THAT THE CDC. TOOK RASCAL AND USED IT FOR WHAT IT DISSEMINATED AROUND THE THE NATION I'M YEARS AGO AFTER WE DEVELOPED IT. AND SO IT SERVED US IN GOOD STEAD BUT IT CAN CERTAINLY BE IMPROVE NOW. S. TO SECOND THE RIGHT THING IF THERE ARE NO FURTHER QUESTIONS. AYE WELL LA THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE. FOR ALL TRYING TO IMPROVE AND ANYTHING YOU CAN THAT GET TO S. BESIDES THE ACCURACY OF PHAM. AND FEASIBILITY OF HAVING. TESTS AFTER PEDIATRICIAN'S OFFICE WOULD BE VERY MUCH APPRECIATED AND THANK YOU AGAIN VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE. UP NEXT I WOULD LIKE TO INVITE JENNIFER CAN'T DIRECTOR AND JC COOPER ASSISTANT DEPUTY DIRECTOR. OF HEALTH CARE DELIVERY SYSTEMS FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. COME TO THE STAND TO PROVIDE US WITH AN OVERVIEW OF HOW THAT DEPARTMENT. OVERSEAS IN MEDICAID AND MANAGES MEDI CAL DATA AND TRACKS THE MANDATED BLOOD TESTING LUDLOW LEAD TESTING. DATA CHILDREN ON MEDI CAL ARE REQUIRED TO RECEIVE I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHAT YOUR DEPARTMENT PROVIDED THE COMMITTEE WITH UPDATED STATISTICS ON COMPLIANCE. SHE INCLUDED IN AND THE DAMN THEM TO OUR HEARING MEMO. PLEASE FEEL WELCOME TO REFER TO THESE UPDATED. DATING YOUR TESTIMONY. CAN WORSHIP PLACED AB BOTH OF YOU THAT I AM HERE TODAY AND CERTAINLY TAKE UP TO THIRTY MINUTES FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. GREAT. SO GOOD AFTERNOON JENNIFER KENT'S. DIRECTOR FOR THE DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES I WILL. IMMEDIATELY TELL YOU THAT I DID NOT HAVE THIRTY MINUTES WORTH OF PRESENTATIONS SO. IN PREPARING FOR THIS. COMMITTEE TESTIMONY IN AND WORKING WITH YOUR STAFF AND WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND. IT'S A IT WAS CLEAR TO US THAT AND. WE'RE NOT AS FAMILIAR WITH THIS COMMITTEE AND NOR IS THIS COMMITTEE ALL THAT FAMILIAR WITH. HEALTH CARE DELIVERY SERVICES AND SO I WANTED TO KIND OF JUST STEP BACK JUST A SECOND AND EXPLAIN. KIND OF SOME VERY HIGH LEVEL AND COMPLIMENTS OF OUR PROGRAM AND HOW WE WORK WHICH IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN HOW THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH WORKS AND SO I THINK WE ARE JUST AS INTERESTED IN WORKING. WITH YOU ON TO EXPLAIN THERE'S DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PUBLIC HEALTH DATA AND OURS IN THERE SOME CRITICAL WAYS IN WHICH WE COLLECT THE DATA THAT'S DIFFERENT SO. I JUST WANTED TO YOU FIRST OFF. SAY WE HAVE A PROGRAM OF APPROXIMATELY THIRTEEN AND A HALF MILLION. BENEFICIARIES TODAY THERE'S ABOUT FIVE AND A HOUSE TO ALMOST SIX MILLION CHILDREN AGES ZERO TO TWENTY IN THE PROGRAM. WE HAVE. SEVEN MAIN DELIVERY SYSTEMS THAT WE OVERSEE WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES A LOT OF TIMES PEOPLE THINK OF FEE FOR SERVICE AS THE MEDICAL PROGRAM THAT'S ONE. OF THE SYSTEMS BUT NOT THE ONLY ONE BY ANY STRETCH OF THE IMAGINATION. BETWEEN EIGHTY FIVE AND NINETY PERCENT OF OUR THIRTEEN AND A HALF MILLION MEMBERS ARE ENROLLED IN A MANAGED CARE PLAN. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THROUGHOUT THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES WE HAVE TWENTY FOUR CONTRACTING HEALTH PLANS THAT WE WORK WITH. TODAY TO DELIVER CARE TO THOSE AND APPROXIMATE TEN AND A HALF TO ELEVEN MILLION BENEFICIARIES. OUR OTHER MEAN DELIVERY SYSTEMS THAT WE OVERSEE OUR DENTAL DOUBLE FEE FOR SERVICE SYSTEM DENTAL MANAGED CARE SYSTEM. CALIFORNIA CHILDREN'S SERVICES SYSTEM WHICH IS OUR OLDEST PROGRAM STARTED IN NINETEEN TWENTY SEVEN. WHICH. HANDLES CHILDREN WITH RARE. AN UNUSUAL OR. CHRONICLE ATRA MATIC. CHILDHOOD INJURIES WERE IRATE INDICAN DISORDERS CANCER CEREBRAL PALSY HEMOPHILIA. AND THEN LASTLY WE HAVE A MENTAL HEALTH DELIVERY SYSTEM THROUGH OUR COUNTIES FOR SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH. AS WELL AS SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER AND. AND VARIOUS COUNTIES DEPENDING ON THE COUNTY THAT WE'RE WORKING WITH. SO YOU TAKE ALL OF THOSE BIG. DELIVERY SYSTEMS WITH A LOT OF DIFFERENT. MOVING PARTS AND INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE AND MEDI CAL CAN BE AND ONE OF THE SYSTEMS THAT CAN BE AND ALMOST ALL OF THOSE SYSTEMS. INCLUDING DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES SO IF WE HAVE A CHILD WITH AN INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY THEY MAY BE IN OUR DDS. SISTER DEPARTMENT FOR LETTERMAN ACT SERVICES AND SO. WHEN WE STARTED I'M COMING THROUGH THE DATA ON THIS I'M REQUEST WITH THE COMMITTEE IT BECAME QUICKLY APPARENT TO US THAT. HOW WE CAPTURE DATA AS OPPOSED TO HOW AND THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CAPTURE STATE IS VERY VERY DIFFERENT? SO IN MEDI CAL TODAY WITH OUR. CONTRACTING HEALTH PLANS WE HAVE TWENTY FOUR PLANS WE HAVE CONTRACTS THAT WE HAVE WITH THEM THAT ARE TWO THREE HUNDRED PAGES LONG. THERE ARE PROVISIONS IN THE CONTRACT BETWEEN US IN THE PLAN THAT SAYS THESE ARE THE REQUIREMENTS THAT YOU HAVE TO DO. TO PROVIDE APPROPRIATE BLOOD LEAD SCREENING TESTS FOR CHILDREN. IDEALLY AT AGES BETWEEN TWELVE MONTHS AND TWENTY FOUR MONTHS SO THAT'S OUR CONTRACTUAL REQUIREMENT BETWEEN OUR PLANS AND US. WE HAVE GUIDANCE OUT TO THE PLANS. DATING ALL THE WAY BACK TO TWO THOUSAND AND TWO. WE USUALLY ISSUE GUIDANCE TO OUR PLANS FOR WHAT IS KNOWN AS AN ALL PLANNED LETTER SO THAT'S KIND OF OUR. REGULATORY DOCUMENT THAT WE CLEANER QUE OUR EXPECTATIONS AND REQUIREMENTS OF THE PLANS ON AND SO WE HAVE LETTERS AND TO THE PLAN STATING ALL THE WAY BACK TO TWO THOUSAND TWO BECAUSE WE HAVE OBVIOUSLY. UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE I HAVE A LEAD SCREENING ESPECIALLY IN LOW INCOME POPULATIONS AND WHAT IT MEANS AROUND DEVELOPMENTAL MILESTONES. AND SO OUR PLANS ARE UNDER INSTRUCTION BY US TO BOTH PAY FOR AND FACILITATE. THE DELIVERY OF THE SERVICES FOR CHILDREN AT THESE PARTICULAR. POINTS IN TIME. PLANS HAVE. CONTRACTED NETWORKS OF PROVIDERS SO IF YOU ARE IN LOS ANGELES. YOU ARE IN LA CARE HEALTH PLAN LA CARE HEALTH PLAN HAS AND THREE. PLANS THAT THEY DO WORK WITH AS WELL AS MEDICAL GROUPS AND SO LA CARE GOES TO ITS CONTRACTING PROVIDERS AND SAYS IF YOU HAVE A MEDICAL CHILD IN YOUR PRACTICE WE EXPECT YOU TO PROVIDE. BLOOD LEAD SCREENINGS AT TWELVE MONTHS AND AT TWENTY FOUR MONTHS IF THEY DON'T HAVE A SCREENING AT TWELVE MONTHS YOU'REINSTRUCTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE ONE AT TWENTY FOUR MONTHS. AND WE'VE A VARIETY OF OTHER INSTRUCTIONS. FOR ALL POPULATIONS WE HAVE VACCINATION REQUIREMENTS WE HAVE IT CUT ABOUT DIABETES THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT CLINICAL. MEASURES AND METRICS THAT WE USE. AND COMMUNICATING WITH THE PLANS AS WELL AS THE PROVIDERS DOWN BELOW. WHEN PROVIDER SEE A CHILD IN MEDI CAL. THEY WILL BILL AN ENCOUNTER TO THE HEALTH PLAN SAID THIS IS A PHYSICIAN THAT HAS A CHILD IN THEIR OFFICE AND THEY'RE DOING A WELL CHILD VISIT. AND THEY MAY BE DOING A VARIETY OF THINGS. FOR THAT CHILD AT THAT PARTICULAR VISIT ONE OF WHICH MAY BE A BLOOD LEAD SCREENING AND ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WE THINK PERHAPS SOME OF THE STATE THAT IS AND SUCH. IT AND IT'S A IT'S NOT MATCHING UP WITH WHAT THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH IS. THAT. PROVIDER MADE DO THE SCREENING BUT THEY SIMPLY MAY NOT REPORT THAT TESTS TO THE HEALTH PLAN WHICH IS ARE MEAN AGGREGATOR OF SUCH DATA. SO IF YOU'RE A PROVIDER AND YOU ARE SEEN THOSE PATIENTS AND ALL YOU'RE DOING IS SUBMITTING WHAT WE CALL AN ENCOUNTER TO THE PLAN IT BASICALLY TELLS THE PLAN I SAW THIS CHILD FOR WELL CHILD VISIT. AND SO THE PLAN REPORTS THAT WELL CHILD VISIT TO US BUT IT MAY NOT INCLUDE ALL THE SUB COMPLIMENTS OF WHAT THAT PROVIDER. GAVE ARE PERFORMED ON THAT CHILD SO THAT'S ONE KIND OF KEY AREA WHERE WE THINK THE DATA IS PROBABLY NOT AS GOOD AS WE WOULD LIKE IT TO BE. THERE WERE. CHANGES MADE. TO A FORM THAT WE USE TO USE THAT WAS A PAPER BASED AND. CARBON TRIPLICATE FORM AND IT WAS CALLED THE PM ONE SIXTY. IT'S GONE AWAY IT WASN'T COMPLIANT WITH A LOT OF REQUIREMENTS THAT WE HAVE IN TODAY'S WORLD AROUND HEALTH INSURANCE PORTABILITY AND PRIVACY AND IT DIDN'T ACTUALLY FIT INTO ANY KIND OF. I TEAR AUTOMATED SYSTEM AND SO WE HAVE PHASED OUT THE PM ONE SIXTY BUT WHAT THAT DOCUMENT AND WITHOUT FORM USED TO DO FOR US WAS THAT WAS KIND OF ONE OF THE WAYS THAT PROVIDERS INDICATED THAT THEY HAD DONE A CHILD LED. SCREENING ON A CHILD SO THEY CAN VOLUNTARILY PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION BUT THEY'RE NOT MANDATED TO PROVIDE IT AND SO THERE'S NOT ALWAYS A FAIL SAFE WAY TO CAPTURE AN ACCOUNT FOR THAT. PROVISION OF SERVICE AND SO WE THINK THAT THAT IS PROBABLY ONE AREA. IN WHICH WERE NOT GETTING A LOT OF COMPLIANCE AND WITH THE PROVIDER COMMUNITY ESPECIALLY IF THEY'RE NOT BEING. PAID TO PROVIDE SOME OF THESE PIECES OF DATA RIGHT THEY IF THEY'RE LIKE I'M GETTING. YOU KNOW FIFTY DOLLARS FOR THIS EXAM BUT I'M NOT GOING TO BE REIMBURSED FOR THE TIME SPENT YOU KNOW FILLING OUT A VACCINATION RECORD OR FILLING OUT OF. YOU KNOW A SPORTS CLEARANCE AURA LED SCREENING OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT WE MAY THEY MAY PERFORM ALL THOSE THINGS BUT WE MAY JUST NOT SEE THE APPROPRIATE KIND OF DOCUMENTATION AND PAPER WORK AROUND THAT. AND THE LAST THING I WOULD SAY. ON SOME OF THE DATA IS THAT WE KNOW ON HOW MANY CHILDREN WE HAVE AND MEDI CAL AND WHAT I THINK WAS AND VERY TELLING WHEN WE WERE WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH WHICH WE WORK WITH I'M QUITE CLOSELY AT IT. IN PARTICULAR HISTORICALLY ON THIS PROGRAM IS THEY. ARE VERY ACCURATE WHEN THEY SAY THEY SEE THE END OF THE PIPELINE SO THEY KNOW HOW MANY CHILDREN WERE TESTED BECAUSE THEY'RE SEEN THE ACTUAL LAB TESTING DATA. WE ARE SEEN. SOME OF THE DATA ON THE FRONT ENDS MEANING THE PROVIDER HAS. SCREEN THE CHILD BUT THEN THE MATCH UP BETWEEN WHAT WERE YOU SEEN AS OUR DENOMINATOR IS OUR AND ROLLED MEDICAID BENEFICIARIES. WITHIN OUR PROGRAM AND. PUBLIC HEALTH IS USING. BOTH CENSUS DATA AND OTHER KINDS OF ESTIMATES FOR HOW MANY CHILDREN THEY THINKER AND THE. POPULATION OF LOW INCOME WHEREAS WE ARE WORKING WITH LIKE HARD NUMBERS AS IT PERTAINS TO OUR ELIGIBILITY DATABASE. SO I THINK. I WILL CLOSE AND AND HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AND GC IF I'VE MESSED UP ANYTHING FROM A FACTUAL. PLACE WILL CERTAINLY. HELP CLARIFY MY. THINKING. BUT I WANT TO ALSO SAY IS THAT I'M WE SEE VALUE ON BOTH AND WHAT THE COMMITTEE WAS ASKING AS WELL IT'S KIND OF MAKING US GO BACK AND LOOK AT SOME OF OUR POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT WE HAVE WITH THE PLANS. WE CERTAINLY ARE GOING TO BE I'M LOOKING AT THIS I'M ALL PLAN LETTER WHICH WE ISSUED BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWO. TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PLANS ARE AWARE THAT WE. CAN MONITOR TO THAT FOR COMPLIANCE PURPOSES WE ANNUALLY AUDIT ALL OF OUR MANAGED CARE PLANS. OUR PLANS IN TURN ARE REQUIRED TO SURVEY THEIR PROVIDERS ON SITE EVERY THREE YEARS AND SO IT'S JUST ONE OF THOSE. GOOD REMINDERS FOR ALL OF US I'M IN MY DEPARTMENT IS CERTAINLY NOT LEFT OUT IN THIS IS THAT WE ALWAYS NEED TO MAKE SURE. THAT WE ARE. DOUBLE BACK CHECKING WITH OUR PLANS TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE ENSURING COMPLIANCE WITH IN THE PROVIDER COMMUNITY AND LIKEWISE THAT THE PLANS ARE IN COMPLIANCE WITH OUR EXISTING CONTRACTUAL RESPONSIBILITIES WITH THEM AS WELL AS OUR GUIDANCE TO THEM ON THESE PARTICULAR ISSUES. THERE WAS AND I DON'T KNOW THAT THE COMMITTEE WAS AWARE OF THAT THERE WAS. SOME MEDICAID GUIDANCE ISSUED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. CENTER FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES AWHILE BACK THAT TALKED ABOUT UNIVERSAL VERSUS TARGETED SCREENING AS IT PERTAINS TO LEAD SCREENING. I'M WE HAVE WE HAVE AND WE ARE A STATE THAT DOES UNIVERSAL SCREENING. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ESSENTIALLY GAVE GUIDANCE TO STATE MEDICAID PROGRAMS AND SAID TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU FEEL TARGETED SCREENING IS MORE APPROPRIATE AYE EE. YOU DON'T HAVE TO SCREEN EVERY CHILD BUT YOU HAVE TO JUST SCREEN CHILD CHILDREN IN CERTAIN AREAS WHERE YOU BELIEVE THAT THERE'S A HIGH PREPONDERANCE OF FLAT OR IN CERTAIN POPULATIONS. THEY LEFT IT OPEN TO THE STATE'S. AND WE AS A STATE HAVE NOT CHANGED OUR UNIVERSAL SCREENING APPROACH BUT WHAT I WILL SAY IS THAT. OTHER PAYERS MEANING PRIVATE COMMERCIAL INSURANCE AND OTHER. SYSTEMS HAVE GONE TO TARGETED SCREENING AND SO WE ALL USE THE SAME. DOCTORS AND SO THERE IS PROBABLY WE ASSUME SOME CONFUSION IN THE PROVIDER COMMUNITY WHICH IS DO WE DO UNIVERSAL SCREENING OR DO WE DO TARGETED SCREENING AND THEY'RE GETTING CONFLICTING MESSAGES. BOTH FROM US AS A PAYER. AS WELL AS FROM OTHER PEER GROUPS AND SO I WOULD JUST STIPULATE THAT THAT ALSO IS KIND OF OUT THERE IN THE. PROVIDER COMMUNITY IN TERMS OF THEY'RE NOT QUITE SURE WHETHER THEY SHOULD BE SCREENING EVERYONE OR IF THEY SHOULD ONLY BE. SCREENING CHILDREN THAT HAVE CERTAIN RISK FACTORS. SO. AB ANSWER QUESTIONS AND THANK YOU FOR HAVING US. ALRIGHT AND THEN THE ADMINISTRATION COOPER ASSISTANT DIRECTOR. IT'S SO I I I I WILL BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS EYES SUPPORT EVERYTHING THAT DATA DIRECTOR CAN'T JUST SAID. OF GREEN WITH YOUR BOSS YES. GOOD IT WOULD BE EMBARRASSING OPENING THING I'LL TURN. MISTRESS DID YOU HAVE A QUESTION. YES THANK YOU. WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT JUST THE LAST THING YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT TARGETING SCREENING VERSES UNIVERSAL SCREENING. EVEN IF WE TALK ABOUT TARGETING SCREENING. WOULD YOU AGREE THAT. THOSE ON MEDI CAL SHOULD BE TARGETED FOR THE SCREENING. NO I THINK I MEAN THIS IS WHY WE AS A STATE HAVE NOT CHANGED OUR APPROACH FROM UNIVERSAL SCREENING THE TARGETED SCREENING IS I THINK THAT. A QUICK AND TO BE HONEST IN A STATE AS LARGE. AND IS KIND OF COMPLICATED AS OURS IS I'M NOT EVEN SURE AND WE CERTAINLY DON'T POSSESS THE CLINICAL. EXPERTISE FROM AN ENVIRONMENTAL STANDPOINT I DON'T KNOW HOW WE AS A DEPARTMENT WOULD LOOK AT CERTAIN EITHER GEOGRAPHIC AREAS OF THE STATE AND SAY OH YES THESE ARE DEFINITELY PLACES THAT. SHOULD BE TARGETED OR THESE ARE CERTAIN I'M HOUSING COMPLEXES THAT SHOULD BE IDENTIFIED I THINK WE FEEL THAT IS PROBABLY JUST SAFER ON THE NATURAL TO JUST ASSUME. THAT EVERYBODY SHOULD BE SCREENED AND TO THE EXTENT THAT UNIVERSAL SCREENING. HELPS IDENTIFY CERTAIN AREAS SUCH AS WHAT PUBLIC HEALTH WAS SAYING WE CAN YOU KNOW DRIVE DOWN TO ZIP CODES AND WE CAN REALLY HONE IN ON. CHILDREN IN A PARTICULAR AREA THAT ARE SHOWING HIGH LEVELS OF LEAD IN THEIR BLOOD TESTS. THAT'S GREAT BUT I THINK OUR ATTITUDE IS IS WE WOULD PREFER PROBABLY JUST TO STAY AT A UNIVERSAL SCREENING LEVEL AND NOT ASSUME ANYTHING ESPECIALLY BECAUSE WE DON'T POSSESS. SCIENTIFIC EXPERTISE ON HOW TO BETTER TARGET. IT MAY THOUSAND EMPLOYEES. IT IN THIS UNIVERSAL SCREENING ABOUT. I UNDERSTAND THAT THE THE THE THE PEDIATRICIANS ARE REQUIRED TO TEST BUT THEY ARE NOT MANDATED TO PROVIDE THE INFORMATION. CONFIRMING THAT THEY TESTED. AND YOU DON'T FIND THAT OUT UNTIL YOU DO AUDITS OF THE OF THE RECORDS IS SET IN MY HEARING THAT CORRECTLY. SURE AND JC CAN ALSO HELP TURN IN ON SOME OF% THESE DETAILS SO AND. PLANS ARE RECEIVE ENCOUNTER CLAIMS FROM PROVIDERS SO A CHILD COULD BE BROUGHT IN FOR THEIR TWELVE MONTHS. WELL CHILD EXAM AND THE PROVIDER WILL. ESSENTIALLY CLAIMED TO THE PLAN I DID THE WELL CHILD EXAM IN THE BILL A SINGLE CODE UNITS. NINE THOUSAND. ONE TWO ONE NO ONE CODING AND MAKE IT UP BUT THAT'S THEY BILL THAT. AND THEY MAY DO A VARIETY OF OTHER PROCEDURES ARE OTHER SERVICES DURING THAT WELL CHILD EXAM BUT THEY SIMPLY JUST DON'T IDENTIFY WITH THOSE WERE IN THE CLAIM TO THE PLANETS OF THE PLAN DOESN'T HAVE THAT DATA IT'S NOT. MANDATED. WHAT WE DO IS WE? GO EN AND AUDIT THE PLANS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE GOING TO THE CONTRACT SO SOMETIMES WE DO WHAT'S KNOWN AS. HE DOSE. HE DISCOURSE AND IN TRYING TO KEEP MY HEALTH. HEALTH. ACRONYMS AS LIGHT AS POSSIBLE SO I DON'T LOSE YOU AND THOSE ARE ESSENTIALLY EMPIRICALLY DETERMINES PEER REVIEWED MEASUREMENTS THAT WE GO AND TO THE PLANTS AND SAY WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT YOU ARE DOING CERTAIN. SERVICES FOR CERTAIN POPULATIONS. AT A LEVEL IN WHICH WE FEEL THAT THAT IS A AND A LEVEL OF PERFORMANCE EXPECTATION AND SO. THAT HE TO SCORE FOR EXAMPLE IS MAKING SURE THAT ANY OF YOUR PICKED PATIENTS WITH DIABETES. HAVE AN A. ONE C. BLOOD TESTS. EVERY QUARTER. AND YOU GO INTO A PLAN AND YOU SAY YOU HAVE YOU KNOW EX NUMBER OF. INDIVIDUALS IDENTIFIED WITH DIABETES ON AN X. PERCENTAGE WHEN WE DID CHART POLLS AND DID A KIND OF A STATISTICALLY THIS. BALLOTS SAMPLING. YOU HAD SEVENTY PERCENT OF THOSE PATIENTS WITH DIABETES THAT HAD NAY ONE C. TEST AND SO YOU HAVE A CERTAIN HE TO SCORE ATTACHED TO THAT. WE GO IN AND WE DON'T HAVE A SPECIFIC TIME HE'D A SCORE AROUND LED SCREENING PER SE BUT WE HAVE AND HOW MANY. PLANS AND PROVIDERS ARE DOING WELL CHILD EXAMPLE BUT WE GO IN AND SURVEY THE PROVIDERS THEMSELVES WE WILL DO RANDOM SHARPLES AND SAY ARE YOU IN COMPLIANCE WITH OUR CONTRACT TO DO. BLOOD LEVEL SCREENS AND THEN WHEN WE GO ON AND DO OR IF THE PLANNED AS A PROVIDER SITE REVIEW THEY WILL PULL CHARTS AND SAY ARE YOU DOING BLOOD BLOOD SCREENING ON YOUR KIDS AT TWELVE MONTHS. SO WE DON'T. DO A HUNDRED PERCENT COMPLIANCE CHECKS BUT WE CERTAINLY. SAMPLE. WITHIN KIND OF A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT. POLL TO MAKE SURE THAT PLANS ARE IN COMPLIANCE WITH A VARIETY OF THINGS INCLUDING BLOOD SCREENING BUT IT'S NOT A HE THIS MEASURE PER SE. BUT IT IS YOUR STATISTICS THAT SHOWED ONLY TWENTY EIGHT PERCENT ARE BEING TESTED IS THAT RIGHT. MORE THERE WERE A COUPLE DIFFERENT PIECES OF DATA THAT WE PROVIDED THAT AND I BELIEVE YOU SHOULD HAVE A COPY OF THE AN ADDENDUM OF THE DATA BUT. I'M IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN WE ARE REPORTING IN MANAGED CARE I'M WHICH IS AS REPORTED ABOUT EIGHTY NINE PERCENT ARE CHILDREN ARE IN MANAGED CARE. OF THE NUMBER IS FORTY TWO POINT SEVEN PERCENT FOR AT THE TWELVE MONTHS SCREENING UP THIRTY THREE PERCENT OUT THE TWENTY FOUR MONTHS SCREENING WITHIN PEEPER SERVICES ABOUT THIRTY SEVEN PERCENT AT THE TWELVE MONTHS SCREENING. AND TWENTY SIX POINT FOUR AT THAT TWENTY FOUR MUCH MEANS WE DID PROVIDE REVISED DATA TO SHOW A BOTH MANAGE CARE AND FEE FOR SERVICE NUMBERS SEPARATELY AT THE TWELVE MONTH AND THE TWENTY FOURTH MONTH. THE MY FINAL QUESTION PLEASE. WHAT DO YOU RECOMMEND IT? IT'S CLEAR AND IT. ARE CHAIR WRIST GOD GAVE SOME OF THE INFORMATION REGARDING HOW SERIOUS THIS IS. THE THE CHILDREN IF THEY'RE NOT TESTED EARLY HOUSES REQUIRED. AND WE DON'T FIND THIS WE DON'T KNOW PROVIDE SERVICES TO THEM. IT CAUSES IRREPARABLE HARM. SO KNOWING THAT AND KNOWING THAT THE STATISTICS. WHETHER IT'S TWENTY EIGHT PERCENT OR. OR THREE QUARTERS THAT ARE TESTED OR AS WAS SAID EARLIER. PERHAPS ONLY A QUARTER WERE NOT TESTED. THE FACT THAT THEIR CHILDREN WERE NOT TESTED WHAT DO YOU RECOMMEND THAT WE DO WHAT WHAT SHOULD BE REQUIRED SO THAT WE GET CLOSER TO THE ONE HUNDRED PERCENT. IF TESTING OUR CHILDREN WELL I THINK YOU KNOW CERTAINLY WHAT WE. DETERMINED AFTER WORKING. WITH BOTH YOUR STAFF AS WELL AS PUBLIC HEALTH IS THAT WE OURSELVES ARE GONNA GO BACK TO THE PLANTS THAT WE CONTRACT WITH. AND. DO A REVISION ON BOTH THE POLICY AND PROCEDURE RIGHT WHICH IS YOU KNOW MAKE SURE THAT THE PLANS KNOW THAT THEY HAVE THIS CONTRACTUAL REQUIREMENT. WE ARE GOING TO REVIEW THE ALL PLAN LETTER IN THE GUIDANCE THAT WE GAVE TO THE PLANS. SEVERAL YEARS AGO TO MAKE SURE IT STILL BALLOT OBVIOUSLY A LOT HAS CHANGED. AND OUR PROGRAM UMB WITH THE EXPANSION. IN TWENTY FOURTEEN AND WE HAVE A MUCH MORE SIGNIFICANT. BENEFICIARY PARTICIPATION THAN WE DID BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWO SO I THINK THIS WAS A GOOD. BOTH REMINDER TO US TO GO BACK AND. RE REVIEWS SOME OF OUR BOTH GUIDANCE AND REQUIREMENTS I THINK IT WILL ALSO AND BE SOMETHING THAT WE WANT TO WORK WITH PUBLIC HEALTH AND I KNOW THAT AND DIRECTOR SMITH. ALSO REFERENCED IT IN TERMS OF MAKING SURE THAT OUR DATA IS MAYBE BETTER. LINKS BECAUSE WE ARE WE ARE CLEARLY NOT COMPARING. THE SAME NUMERATORS AND DENOMINATORS RIGHT THEY HAVE A VERY DIFFERENT WAY OF HOW THEY. HAVE A METHODOLOGY FOR HOW THEY ASSUME THE LEVEL OF TESTING IN CALIFORNIA AND I THINK YOU KNOW YOUR YOU SHOULD DO BETTER AS TO DEPARTMENTS TO SAY ALRIGHT LET'S PUT. YOUR TESTS. DATA TOGETHER WITH OUR IN ELIGIBILITY DATA AND LET'S SEE EITHER WHAT THE OVERLAP IS OR. IS THERE A BETTER WAY THAT WE CAN COMMUNICATE WITH. PROVIDERS ARE CLINICS IN WHICH THESE POPULATIONS ARE MOST LIKELY TO BE SEEKING CARE TO ENSURE THAT THEY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING I THINK THE OTHER THING IS. THERE'S A VARIETY OF ORGANIZATIONS THAT WE WORK WITH AS WELL AS I'M WHAT THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH HAS IN TERMS OF OUTREACH WITH. I'M LOCAL COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. THE LEAD PIPE PREVENTION PROGRAMS FIRST FIVE THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT. ENTITIES THAT WE CAN WORK WITH TO. BOTH HIGHLIGHT THE IMPORTANCE ABOUT. THE SCREENING AND TESTING AS WELL AS ENSURING THAT OUR PROVIDERS KNOW THAT THIS IS AN EXPECTATION ON THEM WHEN THEY SEE THESE CHILDREN AT THE CERTAIN PERIODICITY SCHEDULES. THANK YOU. PLANET A VICE CHAIR CHEN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. MY QUESTION IS SINCE THERE IS YOU KNOW A FINITE AMOUNT OF FINANCIAL RESOURCES. AND THOUGH I THINK UNIVERSAL TESTING IS A GREAT WAY TO GO. IS IT MORE EFFICIENT. AS A MORE SCIENTIFIC IF WE HAD TESTING IN SPECIFIC AREAS THAT YOU HAVE HOMES THAT ARE. PRE NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT THAT DO HAVE AREAS IN WHICH THEY DO NOT HAVE MUNICIPAL WATER LINES ON THAT ARE A LOT MORE MUCH MORE HIGHER ENTERS A LIKELIHOOD OF HAVING. THAT LED A ISSUES IF YOU WILL. SUPPOSE OTHER NEWER COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT OUR STATE. AND GIVEN THE FINANCIAL CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WE'RE IN RIGHT NOW. SO COUPLE THOUGHTS I'M ONE IS THAT WOULD AND LIKE I SAID EARLIER. WE DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE. THE ENVIRONMENTAL. FOR SCIENTIFIC EXPERTISE TO KIND OF DETERMINE WHAT THOSE. HIGHER. PERCENTAGES PART PARTS OF CALIFORNIA ARE IN TERMS OF HOUSING AND WE DO A LOT OF THINGS BUT WE DON'T DO AS WELL LEAD ASSESSMENTS VERY WELL THAT'S NOT OUR OUR BODY OF. EXPERTISE SO I WOULD. WE WOULD DESPERATELY NEED TO RELY ON SOMEONE ELSE TO BE ABLE TO HELP US DETERMINE IF WE WERE GOING TO TARGET WHAT WOULD THAT LOOK LIKE AND HOW WOULD WE DO IT. ON AS A MEDICAID PROGRAM IT'S AN ENTITLEMENT PROGRAM WHICH MEANS ANY BENEFICIARY THAT IS ENTITLED TO MEDICAID SERVICES RECEIVE THEM SO WE DON'T. I DON'T THINK WE WOULD EVER TARGET AND LIMIT SCREENINGS ONLY TO A CERTAIN POPULATION WITHIN MEDICAID BECAUSE THAT'S NOT HOW WE OPERATE ANY OF THE SERVICES THAT WE HAVE TODAY. THE ONLY OTHER THING I WOULD SAY IS THAT WE PAY THE PLANS. AN ACTUARIAL. APPROVED AND BASED RATE FOR SERVICES THAT ENCOMPASSES. ALL OF THE SERVICES AND SO PLANS GET A PER MEMBER PER MONTH CAPITATION RATE FOR EACH AND EVERY AND ROLE WE. ON THEIR IN THEIR EIGHT COULD CODE SO FOR CHILDREN WE HAVE DEVELOPED A RATE. YOU KNOW SAY IT'S A HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH FOR EASY MATH SO FOR EVERY CHILD THAT THE PLAN HAS BEEN ROLLED WE PAY THEM A HUNDRED DOLLARS EVERY MONTH. THAT COVERS INPATIENT PHARMACY PHYSICIAN SERVICES DURABLE MEDICAL EQUIPMENT YOU'RE ANYTHING THAT THAT CHILD NEEDS FOR MEDICAL NECESSITY AND SO I WOULD ARGUE THAT. THE BLOOD SCREENINGS HAVE BEEN FULLY ENCAPSULATED INTO THAT CAPITATED PAYMENT AND IT'S SUCH AS. SMALL AMOUNT THAT IT WOULDN'T MAKE ANY SENSE TO TRY TO PULL IT OUT AND SO IT'S ALREADY ESSENTIALLY BEING PAID FOR SO I WOULD ARGUE THAT IT'S PROBABLY JUST. SAFER ON THE NATURAL TO JUST ASSUME THAT WE SHOULD DO UNIVERSAL SCREENING AND AND HAVE IT BE COVERED. YEAH. THANK YOU EVAN NEITHER QUESTION EITHER ONE OF THE BENEFITS OF HAVING A MANAGED CARE PROGRAM IS THAT IT'S A HOLISTIC PERSPECTIVE IT FOLLOWS THE PATIENT. THERE'S LESS LIKELY OF DUAL DIAGNOSES ECCENTRICS ULTRA. ON WHAT POLICIES IN PLACE TO WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE DEPARTMENTS IF YOU WILL THROUGHOUT THE COUNTY SYSTEM DO NOT WORK IN SILOS WE HAVE. COUNTY SYSTEMS ARE VAST LIKE LA COUNTY. AND THEY PERHAPS TO BE TREATED AS A PATIENT THEY COULDN'T HAVE CO OCCURRING DISORDERS MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES SUCH AS ABUSE ISSUES. PRIMERICA RICHES ECCENTRIC SUCHER OTHER PAUSES POLICIES IN PLACE RIGHT NOW WITHIN THE STATE IN WHICH WE TRY TO ENCOURAGE. FOR THE DEPARTMENTS NOT TO WORK WITH ONE ANOTHER AT THE FALL THE PATIENT IF YOU WILL. THAT MANAGED CARE PROGRAM DATA. YEAH YOU WORLD INVESTED IN YEAH SO THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION. SO OUR PLANS HAVE CONTRACTUAL RESPONSIBILITIES FOR ALL THE SERVICES THAT THEY'RE REQUIRED TO GIVE ONTO THEIR PATIENTS. ON A MONTHLY BASIS I'M WE SEND THE PLANS. AND ENROLLMENT FILE WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY YOU KNOW HERE ARE THE NUMBER OF ENROLLEES BY IDENTIFIER THAT ARE ENROLLED IN YOUR PLAN AS OF THAT MONTH. SO EVERY MONTH THE PLANS KNOW EXACTLY WHO THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR AND ALL OF THEIR DATA AND INFORMATION. SO DUPLICATION IS REALLY IS ALMOST. REALLY HARD TO DO BECAUSE I'M A PROVIDER WILL. RUN THAT BENEFICIARIES IDENTIFICATION NUMBER AND IT WOULD SHOW AS BELONGING TO LA CARE OR TO HELP THAT I'M USING MY LOS ANGELES EXAMPLE. AND SO THE PROVIDER. AND IF THEY WANTED TO BE PAID FOR THOSE SERVICES WOULD NEED TO BE CONTRACTING WITH THAT PLAN FIRST OF ALL BECAUSE IF THEY'D PROVIDED SERVICES AND THEY WEREN'T THEY RUN THE RISK OF NOT BEING. REIMBURSED SO THAT'S ONE WAY THAT WE WOULD ENSURE THAT THERE'S NOT DUPLICATION THERE ARE. SERVICES THAT THE PLANS ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR AND YOU ALLUDED TO A COUPLE OF THEM MENTAL HEALTH IS ONE. SO IF A CHILD OR AN ADULT HAS A SERIOUS MENTAL HEALTH CONDITION OR REQUIRES SPECIAL TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. OUR PLANS ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE. A MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING WITH THE COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH PLAN WHICH IS I'M RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS CARE. YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT CARE AND THEN THEY HAVE THEY AGREE ON HOW THEY SHARE THAT INFORMATION TO ENSURE. THAT BOTH SIDES KNOW WHAT IS OCCURRING WITH THAT PATIENT IN TERMS OF CLINICAL. DIAGNOSES OR SERVICES THAT ARE BEING PROVIDED SO THAT THEY CAN TRY TO MINIMIZE. DUPLICATION OF YOU KNOW MAYBE I'M TESTING OR DIAGNOSE THE. SO. IT'S NOT PERFECT BY ANY STRETCH OF THE IMAGINATION BUT WE DO HAVE SOME KIND OF BIG THINGS IN PLACE THAT HELP PREVENT ON DUPLICATION ARE UNNECESSARY ON TESTING ON ON PATIENTS. REPUTABLE MISTER CHAIRMAN OF COURSE. SURE THAT YOU DON'T HAVE DEBTS. THANK YOU. ARM THANK YOU THAT'S A THAT'S A GREAT EXPLANATION FROM MY UNDERSTANDING. SO. THE FURTHER COMMUNICATION LINES ON. HEALTH RECORDS OUR EMR EHR. THERE'S DEPARTMENTS. THAT DON'T MAKE IT WITH EACH OTHER WITHIN THE SAME COUNTY. ARE THE REQUIREMENTS ON THE STATE LEVEL AND A CLOSE OF FORCE PART OF IT PART PROBLEM IS IF WE DO MAKE US REQUIREMENTS HOW. HOW THE FUND? THAT HEALTH RECORD AND SOME OF THOSE. ON INFORMATION THAT'S BEEN SURE RIGHT NOW AS PHYSICALLY. A CHART. GOING FROM ONE DEPARTMENT TO THE OTHER AND THINGS GET. FALLING THROUGH THE DEFAULT TO THE CRACKS A WHAT HAVE YOU. ON ITS ITS ONEROUS IS COMPLICATED ON IS THERE. REQUIREMENTS IN PLACE PAULSON PLEASE ENCOURAGE. ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD. EDUCATION METHODOLOGIES ALSO WOULD DEPARTMENTS WITHIN THE COUNTY CAN TUNICATE WITH ONE ANOTHER. I'M I THINK THAT IF. WE HAVE A POSITION AND OUR CHIEF MEDICAL INFORMATION OFFICERS DIVISION SHE'S PROBABLY. DANCING FOR JOY THAT YOU'RE ASKING THESE QUESTIONS RIGHT NOW BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT SHE SPENT HER LIFE DOING. SO WE HAVE AN ENTIRE PORTION OF OUR DEPARTMENT THAT WORKS WITH HOSPITALS AND OTHER ON PROVIDERS AT THE PHYSICIAN LEVEL MEDICAL GROUP LEVEL. TO HELP. INCENTIVIZE THE USE OF ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS AND. OPEN PLATFORM SO MEANING THERE'S NOT PROPRIETARY SYSTEMS THAT CAN'T TALK TO EACH OTHER AND SO. STARTING BACK ON. WITH THAT ARE A FUNDING WHICH IS AMERICANS RECOVERY SOMETHING ACT ON THERE WAS. STRONG INCENTIVES PUT INTO PLACE TO GIVE. THOSE PROVIDERS MANY USING A NINETY TEN FEDERAL MATCH NINETIES NINETY CENTS FEDERAL TEN CENTS US STATE. TO HELP DEVELOP THOSE SYSTEMS TO HELP DEVELOP THOSE PLATFORMS AND SO WE HAVE A WHOLE. SECTION OF OUR DEPARTMENT THAT HAS BEEN WORKING ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY JUST IN THAT AREA ALONE. GC AND MANY OF HER COLLEAGUES ARE ALSO WORKING ON A REALLY INTERESTING PROJECT RIGHT NOW WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND SPECIFIC COUNTIES. CALLED THE WHOLE PERSON CARE PILOT THE IDEA ON THIS IS THAT I'M THAT WAS STARTED IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY CALLED PROJECT TWENTY FIVE AND THAT THEY HAD VERY VERY HIGH RISK. VERY EXPENSIVE PEOPLE THAT CALLED NINE ONE ONE. A LOT AND THEY SAID YOU KNOW WHO ARE THE TOP TWENTY FIVE USERS OF THE NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM AND WHEN THEY LOOKED AT WHO THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHERE THEY HAD SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS THEY HAD SUBSTANCE USE PROBLEMS THEY WERE HOMELESS. THEY MAY HAVE BEEN. YOU KNOW IN JAIL MULTIPLE TIMES THEY WERE HIGH USERS OF THE EMERGENCY ROOM DEPARTMENT AND ALL OF THESE COUNTY AND HEALTH CARE SILOS. KNEW WHO THIS INDIVIDUAL WAS BUT NONE OF THEM KNEW THAT THE OTHER ONE KNEW WHO THOSE PEOPLE WERE AND SO THEY SO SAN DIEGO WAS THE FIRST KIND OF. PUT PEOPLE TOGETHER PUT THE DATA TOGETHER AND THEN. GO AFTER THESE INDIVIDUALS AND WRAP THEM WITH A LOT OF INTENSE OF SOCIAL AND HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND THEY WERE ABLE TO REDUCE THEIR COSTS REDUCE UTILIZATION IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM WHERE THE JAIL. AND SO WE HAVE TAKEN THAT CONCEPT AND. EXPANDED AND SHARED IT WITH OTHER COUNTIES AND SO JC AND OTHERS ARE WORKING WITH THOSE COUNTIES AND ONE OF THE KEY. STARTING BUILDING BLOCKS LOCAL PERSON CARE IS THE DATA SHARING SO WE ARE BREAKING AND IT HAS BEEN PAINFUL AND LONG AND EXTRAORDINARILY HARD. YOU'RE BREAKING. SILOS BETWEEN PUBLIC SAFETY. YOU KNOW COUNTY CHILD WELFARE SERVICES SOCIAL SERVICES. HEALTH CARE SERVICES THE MANAGED CARE PLAN AND YOUR AND INTEGRATING THAT DATA AND THEN TRYING TO LOOK AT WHO THOSE INDIVIDUALS ARE AND VERY MUCH GO AFTER AND TARGET THEM SO. WE'RE. KIND OF THAT IS THE NEW HORIZON AND THE NEW. PROBLEM THAT IS APPROACHING HEALTH CARE IT'S NO LONGER KIND OF EASY STUFF WE HAVE GOTTEN INTO THESE POPULATIONS THAT ARE EXTRAORDINARILY. ON DIFFICULT TO EITHER MANAGE DUE TO THEIR YOU KNOW. EXTRAORDINARY LIFE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE THEY HAVE MEDICAL COMPLEXITY THAT IS SIMPLY. OVERWHELMING FOR THEM TO HANDLE ON THEIR OWN AND SO WE'RE STEPPING IN AND TRYING TO PROVIDE CARE COORDINATION. THIS DISCUSSION ON CHILD LED. SCREENING IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE THAT IF YOU ARE. A PARENT OR A FAMILY THAT HAS. CHALLENGES AND THAT YOU'RE NOT BY ENGLISH PROFICIENT YOU MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE. TRANSPORTATION TO GET TO AND FROM MEDICAL APPOINTMENTS OR OTHER TYPES OF APPOINTMENTS AND IF YOU HAVE A CHILD THAT TESTS POSITIVE FOR A HIGH LED SCREEN. YOU ARE ASKING THAT THE VERY GOOD QUESTION AND AND WE WILL CERTAINLY SHARE AND THAT ANSWER IS WHAT DO YOU DO WITH THAT CHILD HOW DO YOU MAKE SURE THAT THE FAMILY DOES THE APPROPRIATE FOLLOW UP. AND THEN HOW DO WE COLLECTIVELY AND SURE THAT SUBSEQUENT TESTING AND OTHER TYPES OF. PROCEDURES ARE DONE AND SO IT'S A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN US AND PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE LOCALS BUT THESE ARE ALL. THESE ARE THE QUESTIONS THAT ON THAT MAKE OUR WORK YOU KNOW BOTH VERY VALUABLE BUT ALSO CHALLENGING SOMETIMES. I. WOULD APPRECIATE ALL THAT YOU'RE DOING A PRETTY THE CHAIRS LEADERSHIP AND MAKING SURE WE HAVE THIS INFORMATIONAL HEARING. WELL KNOWING THAT'S A YEAR ON THIS IN A PUBLIC POLICY STANDPOINT IN THAT RELATES TO A FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES I THINK IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. IN ADDITION TO THAT I THINK THIS IS A A NON PARTISAN ISSUE I THINK THE INVESTMENT IN THIS IS. A CRITICALLY IMPORTANT AND IS GOING TO READ NOT WHEN TERMS OF. PUBLIC POLICY REWARDS ON SOCIAL REWARDS BUT ALSO FINANCE REWARDS AND I DON'T THINK IT IT'S REPUBLICAN DEMOCRAT OR INDEPENDENT. SO I WAS REALLY REALLY APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE DOING BECAUSE I THINK IN LA COUNTY. ON THE OLD SAYING WAS TWENTY PERCENT OF OUR CONSTITUENTS OR THE QUOTE UNQUOTE FREQUENT FLYERS IF YOU WON'T. REALIZE EIGHTY PERCENT OF LA COUNTY'S RESOURCES AND INSTEAD OF TREATING THE SYMPTOMS WE CAN TREAT THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM AND PREVENT. FOLKS FROM DUPLICATION. TREATING THE INDIVIDUAL ITSELF I THINK IT'S SO CRITICAL IMPORTANCE WAS SO NICE TO HAVE THAT LEADERSHIP ON YOUR LEVEL. AND I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU INFORMING US ON THESE CONCERNS IN THESE ISSUES. PERHAPS. WELL. SO I'M QUITE HAPPY THAT YOU SAID YOU'RE GONNA CHECK WITH YOUR CONTRACTORS YOU MAY GET CONFUSED AS TO. WHEN IT'S HAVE REQUIRED CHAIR TESTIMONY DE ISN'T SO I THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR. SOAP DO YOU KNOW THE TOTAL NUMBER OF CHILDREN OF A PARTICULAR AGE THAT ARE SAY REQUIRED HAVE THIS TEST. BETTER ON MEDI CAL OR WHERE X. G. DO YOU KNOW THAT NUMBER. YEAH IT WOULD ITWOULD BE THE NUMBERS THAT WE'VE PROVIDED ON YOU WITH OF HEARTS AND SAID THAT NUMBER YOU NOW. AND THOSE ARE JUST MEDI CAL BENEFICIARIES JUST MEDICARE AND NOT ALL CHILDREN IN CALIFORNIA THEY'RE ONLY MEDICAL BENEFITS. NOW WHEN THE BUILDING IS DONE. ARMED IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THE HOME LABS COULD INCLUDING THE INFORMATION THEY SEND TO THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. THAT THIS WAS A MEDIC OUT PATIENT AND THEN WE WOULD NO THE FRACTION OF MEDI CAL PATIENTS THAT WERE BEING TESTED. BUT I THINK. AND THIS IS WHERE I IT'S IT IT'S ALSO BEEN A GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO REVISIT OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH A DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH ON THE DATA. IT'S NOT AND THAT PARENTS INCOME LEVEL ARE STATUS IS NOT NECESSARILY REPORTED TO THE LAB BUT WE HAVE THE MECHANICS IN PLACE WE THINK TO DO THE DATA MATCH ON OUR SIDE BETWEEN THE TWO DEPARTMENTS. AND SAID THEY HAVE THE ON TESTING DATA. WITH UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS AND WE HAVE IDENTIFIERS IN THE MEDICAL DATA BASE THAT WE CAN DO A DATA LINKAGE ON THE BACK AND AND SO WE CAN CERTAINLY WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT TO TRY TO. GO THERE BECAUSE I GOT PUT THAT BACK TOGETHER BECAUSE I DON'T THINK. ANYTIME THAT YOU GO BACK AND ASK OTHER. PEOPLE TO DO SOMETHING YOU MAY NOT GET A HUNDRED PERCENT COMPLIANCE AND SO I THINK WE WOULD PUBLIC TRUST OUR DATA LINKAGE FIVE. BETTER THAN ANYTHING ELSE YEAH DEBBIE GREAT YEAH WILL AND CERTAINLY. PROVIDE YOU AN UPDATE WILL TALK WILL HAVE OUR DATA EIGHTEEN PEOPLE TALK TO EACH OTHER AND THEN WE'LL SEE IF WE CAN. GIVE YOU AN ASSESSMENT OF HOW LONG WE THINK THAT WOULD TAKE OR WHAT WE THINK THAT THE NUMBERS WOULD LOOK LIKE SO YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO GET BACK TO US IN A MONTH OR SO. WE WILL DO OUR BEST THANK YOU AND BE VERY NICE WELL YOU'VE BEEN VERY HELPFUL AND WE REALLY APPRECIATE IT. ARM AND THEN ANY IDEAS YOU HAVE FUN HOW WE CAN INCREASE THAT COMPLIANCE YOU BROUGHT UP ONE ALREADY. WE CERTAINLY GLAD TO HEAR AND AS HE SAID THE RECORD WILL BE OPEN FOR ANOTHER MONTH THAT LOVE TO REPORT THAT YOU FIGURED OUT. HOW YOU CAN? DETERMINE WHAT THE ACTUAL COMPLIANCE IS SO. THAT WOULD THAT WOULD BE A START SO THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH THANK YOU FOR HAVING. ROOM. THE AYE NEXT OUR PANEL OF WE HAVE. DR COLIN ROBINSON WHO'S MEDICAL DOCTOR AND HEALTH SERVICES ASSISTANT AND CLINICAL PROFESSOR OF MEDICINE AT UCLA INTERNAL MEDICINE AND PEDIATRICS. I HE'S COMING TO THE STAND NOW TO PROVIDE US WITH PEDIATRICIANS PERSPECTIVE ON COMPLIANCE WITH THE LEGAL MANDATE THAT. WHICH I UNDERSTAND IS A CALIFORNIA MANDATE AS OPPOSED FEDERAL. THEY'RE ALL CHILDREN REVELED IN GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS BE TESTED FOR BLOOD VLAD AT AGES ONE AND TWO. BOB THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING. YOU'VE COME UP IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND. IF YOU COULD JUDT TAKE UP TO ABOUT TWENTY MINUTES AFTER YOUR PRESENTATION NOTHING ARE YOU. OF COURSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR INVITING ME TO QUIRK AND AND PAGE. SO I WILL A DEFINITE COKE TWENTY MINUTES I THINK A LOT OF STUFF THAT YOU'LL HAVE ENOUGH QUESTIONS WILL GO THAT LAW THAT. MAYBE WELL JUST TO YOU KNOW. NO BUT ONE OF HIS BROTHERS AND FINANCING IS GOING REALLY WELL SIDE BY SOME THE EXPERTS OBVIOUSLY IN THE HEALTH PLAN AND DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH LEVEL. I'M MORE HERE. HAS. CAN REPRESENT THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS WHICH REPRESENTS OBVIOUSLY. ME WE HAVE A. BRANCHER. IN A REGION HERE IN CALIFORNIA BUT IT'S OBVIOUS IN NATIONAL ORGANIZATION THAT SUCH LOT OF THE STANDARDS AND POLICIES FOR WHAT WE LIKE TO FOLLOW. SO. JUST ABOUT TO BEGIN A LITTLE BIT WITH WHAT. THE AP KIND OF SUCH AS THE GUIDELINES IT JUST SEEMS LIKE MORE DISCUSSION CLEARLY THAT. THE STATE EXCEEDS KIND OF THE REGULATIONS WOULD AT A MINIMUM REQUIRE A TERMS OF TESTING KIDS WERE ON GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS RIGHT SO. THE AP USES WHAT'S CALLED BRIGHT FUTURES IN CASE THAT COMES UP AGAIN THIS KIND OF OUR GUIDELINES FOR OUT OF GO THROUGH WELL CHILD VISITS SO YOU KNOW SIX MONTHS OR TWELVE MONTHS HOLDS TWENTY FOUR MONTHS OLD. AND THESE CORRELATE REALLY WELL TO THE CDC'S US CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION. MUCH AS YOU KNOW. DECADES OF EXPERIENCE IN STUDYING THIS TIME AND THEY'RE THE PEOPLE ORIGINALLY CAME UP WITH THE. THE KNOWLEDGE THAT NO LEVEL OF LATTICED ACCEPTABLE. SO THEY SAY BASICALLY THEY USED TO RECOMMEND A MORE UNIVERSAL SCREEN A ROLL THAT BACK A LITTLE BIT. WITH A RECOMMENDATION TO DO A RISK ASSESSMENT. AT NO CERTAIN POINTS EARLY ON THE AND CHILD'S LIFE UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY FOUR MONTHS. AND THEN ONLY TO DO THE THE BLOOD TEST OF A CAME BACK AS A SUPPOSITORY SEEING THAT THAT FOR THESE KIDS WERE ON MEDI CAL WERE. KIND OF EXCEEDING THAT. AS WELL AND OBVIOUSLY CERTAIN HIGH RISK POPULATIONS MIGHT BE MORE. MORE VULNERABLE OR IT MIGHT BE. MORE YOU KNOW WORTHWHILE TESTING KIND OF UNIVERSALLY. SO WE CAN PARTY COVERED SO WHAT SOME OF THE RISK FACTORS WERE IN TERMS OF THAT THE HOUSING. GENERALLY SPEAKING SO IN OUR IN OUR TRAINING AND AND. AND THE GUIDANCE IS THERE PUT OUT THROUGH OUR COMMUNICATIONS BASED THEY GIVE US KIND OF INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT DOES CONSTITUTES. MALE HIGH RISK PATIENT ARE HIGH RISK PERSON. SO. YOU KNOW THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS MORE AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL HAPPENS IN OUR TRAINING IF YOU RECERTIFY FOR BOARDS EXAMS THIS IS FOR SURE GOING TO BE ON YOUR BOARD EXAM AT LEAST ONE OF THOSE QUESTIONS. BUT. IN TERMS OF DIRECTLY COMMUNICATING WITHIN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT OFTEN DOES COME DOWN TO FILL A LEVEL OF WHICH FOR BEFORE THAT FARM PUBLIC HEALTH AND. AND THE. AND META CALIPHATE WITH THEIR SPECIFIC CONTRACTS AND PLANS IN AND GROUPS THAT THEY WORK WITH AT THAT TIME A MORE GRANULAR LEVEL. TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE PRACTITIONERS. SO. US ONE POINT ALSO TO TO THINK ABOUT IS THAT YOU IN ADDITION TO. PEDIATRICS PRACTITIONERS WHO REDUCING THE LINE CHAIR OF KIDS IN CALIFORNIA ARE NOT THE ONLY ONE TO SEE KIDS IN CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE IN A FAMILY PRACTITIONERS AS WELL MY WIFE IS ONE OF THEM ACTUALLY. WHO SEE KIDS AND? AND THAT'S ALSO PART OF THEIR TRAINING US AS FOR. YUPPIE DOCTOR SORRY PATRICK JOB POSITION ASSISTANCE OR ON FAMILY PRACTITIONER OUR SITE NURSE PRACTITIONER SO THAT'S KIND OF THE CADRE PEOPLE THAT WE SEE. THAT TAKING CARE OF OF KIDS SO YOU KNOW WE WERE DEAD. TIRED AGAIN ADJUSTED AT THE LEVEL OF OF ME AS OPPOSED THE LEVEL OF. THE DIRECTORS THOSE ARE KIND OF THE GROUPS OF PEOPLE WHO ALSO SEE WHO ALSO SEE CHILDREN. SO. WE GOT KIND OF. LISTA QUESTIONS I THINK FROM PAGE BEFORE THE THINGS TO A TO A JUST LOVE THEM AGAIN HAVE ALREADY BEEN ADDRESSED ONE OF THEM WAS I THINK PROBABLY MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION THAT I CAN. SPEAK TO IS IS WHY THESE TESTS AREN'T HAPPENING AND HEARING THE PRIOR. TESTIMONY OR IN THE CAR THE PRIOR STATEMENTS AND THEN ALSO COMPANY TOGETHER MY KNOWLEDGE. OF WHAT HAPPENS I THINK ONE OF THE. THINGS I SEE ON THE GROUND A LOT IS. PHONE CALL NOT COMPLEXITY NOT ADHERENCE TO A PARTICULAR TREATMENT PLANTS. SO ONE EXAMPLE MIGHT BE THE FAMILY MISSES THE TWELVE MONTH POINT BECOMING A FIFTEEN OR FOURTEEN MONTHS AND YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT THE FIFTEEN MONTH WHERE IT'S. YOU KNOW WHAT THE TWELVE MONTH IS THAT NO STANDARD BREAD AND BUTTER TEACHING TO. TO DO THAT THE LEAD SCREENING AND THEN SAME THING AGAIN AT HOW TWENTY FOUR MONTHS THEY MISSED TWENTY FOUR COMING AT THIRTY INSTEAD YOU KNOW LIFE IS BUSY. THINGS ARE CRAZY AND SO THEY THEY MISS THAT AND YOU DON'T THINK BACK TO YOU KNOW THE THE LEAD TESTING. AT THE TWENTY FOUR MONTH KIND OF APPOINTMENT. I SETS SO THAT'S ONE PART OF IT I'M NOT SURE IF MEDI CAL ACTUALLY CAPTURES LIKE WHEN PEOPLE ACTUALLY MISS THOSE APPOINTMENTS YOU KNOW AT THE AT THE SETS PERCENT TIMES. I'M AND THEN OF COURSE NOT GETTING THE TESTS THEMSELVES RIGHT SO I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MANY TIMES I. GO BACK MY YOU KNOW ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD BOX EXPECTING TO SEE SOME LAB RESULTS AND THERE'S NOTHING THERE NOTHING CONTINUES TO COME BACK BECAUSE THE FAMILY JUST. MISUNDERSTOOD WHAT I WENT HOME OR THE GYM WAS REALLY UPSETS OR IN A ONE OF A MILLION THINGS COULD HAVE HAPPENED AND AND THE TEST OF SIMPLY. DIDN'T HAPPEN. AND SO YOU KNOW IT'S KINDA NATURE THE LIFE WE HAVE A SMALL KID AND THAT THINGS LIKE THAT TO COME UP. AND SO I THINK THAT THAT ACTUALLY MIGHT PLAY A LITTLE BIT OF A ROLE AS WELL AS IT IS TOUGH TO CAPTURE THAT RIGHT AT THE LEVEL OF AGAINST ON THE FOLKS WHO'VE BEEN SPEAKING. BEFORE ME. BUT THAT COULD BE SOMETHING THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING UPS I'VE SEEN IT HAPPEN ON A HOW MANY TIMES EVEN IN THE LAST WEEK WITH DIFFERENT TESTS FOR ALL DIFFERENT AGES ACROSS THE THE SPECTRUM THAT I SEE. SO I THINK THOSE ARE KIND OF SOME OF THE MAIN THINGS. JUSTICE SPEAK REALLY QUICKLY TO THE POINT OF CARE TESTING WHICH HAVE COME UP UP AS WELL AS WAS LOOKING THROUGH SOME OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH. HIM BROCHURES THAT'S NEVER REALLY GREAT SET OF OF. INFORMATION PACKETS ONLINE AND THERE IS YOU KNOW A AN EXHORTATION TO REPORT THE POINT OF CARE TESTING BUT AGAIN THOSE ARE. NOT AS EASY TO GET IN THE CLINIC SO IF YOU TO TRY TO MITIGATE THAT'S KIND OF NONCOMPLIANCE FROM THE THE BLOOD DROP IN THE ARE WHICH CAN BE LIVE THE MORE PAINFUL ARE MORE DIFFICULT TO GET. BY GETTING THE POINT OF CARE TESTING. NEARLY AS THEY SOUGHT TO REPORT BUT IT'S IT SOMETIMES IT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE. HAD DIFFICULTY MAINTAINER TO GET THAT POINT AFTER TESTING IS NOT ALWAYS NO CHEAP POOR ARE WORTH. FINANCIALLY WORTH YOU KNOW KEEPING IN THE CLINIC AS OPPOSED TO JUST HAVING THE PERSON GO OVER TO THE LABORATORY LABORATORY DOES AS WE MENTIONED BEFORE. NO REPORT OVER TO. CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH BUT. DUBBED THE POINT OF TESTING YOU KNOW THAT THAT GOES TO A DIFFERENT SORT OF REPORTING FORM RIGHT BECAUSE IT DOESN'T COME FROM A LAB COMMISSION THE CLINIC ITSELF. SO THAT'S ONE ONE AREA THAT MIGHT BE KIND OF A CAP IN THEIR IN THAT WEEK BMB LACKEY MISSING SOME PEOPLE WHO. COULD GET CLINICAL TESTING BUT THE ICONS ARE ABLE TO DO IT AND THEN THEY KINDA MISS OUT ON THE. ON THE VENOUS BLOOD DRAWS ARE THE KINDA MORE PAINFUL BUT JOHNSON THE ARMS THAT. YOU KNOW I WAS TALKING ABOUT BEFORE. SO I THINK. A LEAVE A COUNTY THAT THERE AND. AND CAN OPEN UP TO ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS I THINK JUST FROM THE AP'S PERSPECTIVE. IN OUR OUR MAIN GOAL HERE IS TO BE YOU KNOW HERE FOR INFORMATION HERE'S A RESOURCES WHILE WE HAVE ABOUT A HALF A DOZEN. DOCTORS IN CALIFORNIA THAT WE DO REPRESENTS AND COMMUNICATE WITH. SO IF THERE ARE WAYS THAT WE CAN BE OF SERVICE CAN BE IT CAN BE OF USE. AND PLEASE LET US NOW AND I'M HAPPY TO KIND OF TALK ABOUT THAT A LITTLE BIT MORE. YA AS WE AS WE GO FORWARD. WELL THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH FIRST BILL FOR COMING AND THEN FOR BEING AYE I THINK VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD IN DESCRIBING. BOB WHAT SOME OF THE PROBLEMS ARE AND THAT I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT. BOB YOU WERE DISCUSSING THAT SOMEONE WHO WAS SUPPOSED COMMENDED TWELVE MONTHS COMES IN AT FIFTEEN THIS MAY CREATE SOME CONFUSION IN THE DOCTOR'S MIND. AS TO WHETHER OR NOT I SHOULD BE ASKING FOR THAT LEAD TEST AT THAT TIME. I KNOW AND WE'VE HAD KIDS OF MY OWN ALTHOUGH A LONG TIME AGO. DATA YES. LIFE CAN BE VERY HECTIC FOR PEDIATRICIANS. AND THEY DON'T GET PAID ENOUGH AND. THEY END UP HAVING MORE PATIENCE THAN THAN NAM. THEN PERHAPS IS OPTIMAL AND. SO IT'S IT IS A DIFFICULT LIFE. A CAN YOU THINK OF PROCEDURES THAT WOULD HELP. I TO REMIND THE PEDIATRICIAN. OUR DAD TO. THIS PERSON HASN'T HAD THE LEAD TESTIS THERE SOME. SOMETHING ANY OF THEIR MEDICAL RECORDS THAT COULD BE ADDED THAT WOULD TURN ON. YOU NOW. NEXT ALLEY LOOKS AT THAT MEDICAL RECORD IT SHOWS UP BRIGHT RED GET IT WOULD GET LEAD TEST WE HAVE BEEN DONE IT YET. ARM. JUST ANY SUGGESTIONS YOU COULD MAKE WOULD BE HELPFUL YEAH THAT'S A THAT'S A GOOD POINT SO. ACTUALLY. SEE BOTH ADULTS AND KIDS ACTION OF TO BOARD CERTIFICATION SERGEANTS IN WHAT'S FROM THE ADULTS I BECAUSE I'M WHERE I WORK WE ACTUALLY DO HAVE KINDA. SCOTT HEALTH MAINTENANCE TAB. AND I WOULD IMAGINE A LOT OF PLACES DO THAT FOR KIDS WHO JUST STARTED DEVELOPING AT FOR ADULTS OF FOR EXAMPLE FIFTY TWO YEAR OLD MALE COMES AND. SHOULD HAVE A COLONOSCOPY BY THAT POINT THERE'S A BIG RED DOT BY KIND OF IN THAT PORTION OF THE TAB THAT SAYS HEY. S. PERSON ACTUALLY NEEDS A COLONOSCOPY BECAUSE THEY'RE PASSED THE POINT OF GETTING A TEST. YOU CAN IMAGINE THE SAME THING YOU KNOW GOES FOR SO ACTUALLY DO HAVE A FOR VACCINES FOR OUR CHILDREN AND SO ALSO YOU KNOW THEY NEED TO. THE NEXT IN AMMONIA VACCINE IT'S IN READ WITH A DATE THAT IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE. SO THAT ACTUALLY A GREAT MECHANISM TO TO JUST REMIND DOCTORS THAT THAT'S BUT THAT'S THEIR. ENDS NOT ALL OF THE DIFFERENT HEALTH PLANS ARE ALL DIFFERENT CLINICS ARE SINCE THEN THE HR FOR THE MOST PART SOME OF THEM THEM VERY DIFFERENT THAN OTHERS BUT. YOU COULD HAVE YOU KNOW THOSE KINDS REMINDERS PAPA. NAM. DOES THAT MAKE YOU WOULD HAVE TO HIGH SATISFY THAT TOOK ARE. CLEAR. NOT HAVE A A COMPLIANCE BAR OKAY WELL PERHAPS WE COULD HAVE. OUR DISCUSSIONS LATER RON. WITH APPROPRIATE FOLKS TO SEE. HOW WHETHER OR NOT? THIS EXISTS PARTICULARLY IN THE ONLINE MEDICAL RECORDS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT FRACTION OF PEDIATRICIANS HAVE THEM ONLINE BUT SO THAT THERE IS THIS KIND OF AUTOMATIC. A WARNING THAT COULD PERHAPS HELP. WITH COMPLIANCE FROM THE PEDIATRICIAN AND. AGAIN. AYE QUITE BELIEVE YOU THAT. FOR WHATEVER REASON NOT EVERYONE GETS A BLOOD TEST I'VE TALKED TO. A FRIEND WHO WAS ON MEDICARE ALLEN S. TOLD GET A BLOOD TEST DIDN'T AND DIDN'T AND THEN FINALLY WHEN THE TRIALS AROUND FIVE. SHE GOT THE CHILD A TEST AND IT SHOWED HIGHER BLOOD LEVELS. SHE WAS VERY UPSET AT HERSELF I'VE EVEN HAD THINGS THAT I HAVEN'T DONE HAT MY PEDIATRICIAN ASKED ME TO DO SO. I REMEMBER GETTING UPSET AT ME TOO. ANYWAY. AGAIN I REALLY THINK AND WE'LL FIND OUT FROM THE MEMBERS OF THE FIRST PANEL WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S AN ACCURATE. IN OFFICE TEST. THAT MIGHT BE USED FOR THAT AND OTHERS. ARM. WE DON'T YET KNOW WHETHER OR NOT THERE ARE ADEQUATE TESTS AND THEY'VE EVEN SAID THAT. THE BLOOD DRAW HAS TO BE. FROM MA. OWNER SHOULD NOT BE VENOUS BLOOD DROP THAT HAS TO BE FROM THE. HI. TARTARY. SO THAT JUST TO GET THE ACCURACY THAT THEY NEEDS OF THAT TIME. WELL WE'LL SEE IF THAT'S CLOSELY WHICH REALLY NECESSARY IN TRYING TO GET A BETTER IDEA THAT DO YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS ON. ACCURACY OF IN OFFICE TASKS VERSUS VENUS TASK VERSUS ARTERY TEST THERE ARE ALSO SMART TO MY KNOWLEDGE THINK VENUS TESTING STILL BAND CONCERTS. ADEQUATE FOR FOR. FOR BLOOD DRAWS I THINK THAT THE PROBLEM HAS BEEN IN THE LIMITS OF DETECTION IN THE ACCURACY FOR THE POINT OF CARE ONCE OR EVEN IN BUSY OFFICES THAT ARE. BIKE UP I TALKED ABOUT TO PEDIATRICIANS KIND OF BEEN IN MY AREA IN. KIND OF IN PREPARATION FOR THIS IS WHILE THEY'RE ALL PRETTY RIGID ABOUT GETTING THE TESTING. BUT A LOT OF ACTION BUT NOT MADE THE POINT TO GET THAT THE POINT COURTESY AGAIN BECAUSE OF THE ACCURACY SO I THINK AS WE SEE A LITTLE MORE DEVELOPMENT AND THOSE TESTS. AND WE MIGHT SEE MORE ADOPTION OF UP AND DOWN AGAIN THROUGH YOU KNOW THAT THE ADEQUATE REPORTING. THAT WOULD PROBABLY BRING UP THE LEVELS LITTLE BIT. IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW HOW MANY KIDS ARE BOTH TESTED AND REPORTED RIGHT TO COME CLOSE THAT KIND OF GAP OF WHO'S NOT WHO MIGHT BE TESTED BUT NOT REPORTED IN THE FIRST PLACE. AND THEN. AND I RECEIVED A COSTS A FACTOR FOR SOME CLINICS IS IS A BIG DEAL WITH THESE TESTS POINT ACCORDIONS ARE. CHEAPER JUST GOING THROUGH A FOR A BUNCH OF OTHER DIFFERENT TESTS. NOT ONLY LEAD BUT FOR YOU KNOW KINDA LIVER TESTS AND THINGS LIKE THAT IN A CLINIC AND THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE NOT CHEAP UNFORTUNATE FOR NOW AND HOPEFULLY AS. YOU KNOW. EWING THINGS GO OF IT LESS EXPENSIVE TECHNOLOGIES BASS IS A LITTLE BIT THEN WE CAN MORE RELIABLY USE THOSE ARE EXPECTED TO BE A LITTLE BIT LESS MORE COST EFFECTIVE LESS EXPENSIVE. LEARN. ARM. THAT MEANS TAKE A LOOK AT TO SEE ABOUT SOME OF THE OTHER QUESTIONS I HAVE IN MY NOTES HERE. HOME. DO YOU SEE HERE A DIFFERENCE IN THAT TYPE OF PRACTICE PEOPLE HAVE. DEPENDING ON. WHERE THEY ARE FOR EXAMPLE PEROT PRACTICES VERSUS PRACTICES IN THE CITY'S VERSUS PRACTICES AND CLINICS PURSES? OUR POSITIONS AND ARE AT AT TAKE KAISER WHICH IS HALF THE STATE THIS POINT BUT IT'S DIFFERENT FROM PRIVATE PRACTICE. I UNIVERSITIES. DO YOU SEE DIFFERENT CHALLENGES IN DIFFERENT AREAS. YEAH I MEAN I THINK THERE ARE DIFFERENT. THE COULD EVER PRACTICES IN DIFFERENT AREAS SO. FOR EXAMPLE I SPOKE WITH SOMEONE WHO IS IN PRIVATE PRACTICE WHO WAS VERY VERY DILIGENT AND CONSCIENTIOUS PEDIATRICIAN. SHE. DOES THAT BASIN THAT RISK ASSESSMENT RYAN WAS NEW RISK ASSESSMENT. THEY'LL SAY OKAY IS THE DOES THE CHILD MEETS COMIC. CRITERIA TO GET TESTED AND ON THE GO AHEAD AND TOSS THEM AND ACTUALLY SHE'S ALL HAD ONE CHILD TURNED POSITIVE BECAUSE. RISK ASSESSMENT IS PRETTY GOOD ENOUGH IF YOU ASK THEM REPORT AND HOUSE THOSE MADE BEFORE YOU KNOW NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT OR WHATEVER. AND SO YOU KNOW THAT'S THAT'S THAT PRACTICE THEIR. IN ME I LIKE A COUNTY CLINIC OR. FQHC FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTER THEY TEND TO BE MUCH MORE. ARE ON TOP OF THE INCOME OF THAT'S JUST WHAT THEY DO UNIVERSALLY RIGHT BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE MEDI CAL. UP PATIENTS ARE HEROES BECAUSE MOST OF THE RURAL ENVIRONMENT HAS ALLIES. QUITE THE OPPOSITE THAT BUT. BUT IT DEPENDS YOU KNOW THAT. IT DOES DEPEND EVEN WITHIN THE CITY OF ALACHUA COUNTY OF LA WHERE IT WHERE YOU'RE PRACTICING WHAT THAT. EXPECTATIONS ARE THAT YOU HAVE FOR YOURSELF OR FOR YOUR PATIENCE BUT. SUFFICE TO SAY FOR THOSE WHO ARE DOING COMPLETELY UNIVERSAL GENERALLY SPEAKING THEY'RE EVEN STILL DOING THAT RISK ASSESSMENT. EVEN IF THEY HAVE LIKE A PARENTS EVER SAY I DON'T WANNA. LED TASK. MORE THAN LET'S SAY I'VE THEY WILL SAY THAT I THINK PARTLY IT'S JUST A LITTLE BIT OF. SOME OF THE COULD NOT ARRESTED ALL OF MY HOUSE IS BRAND NEW OR THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT I CAN'T THINK. SOME OF THEM DON'T KNOW THE RISKS OF LETTER WHICH I THINK IS NOT UNDERSTANDABLE BECAUSE THAT ENHANCE. WHICH I GOT OUT THERE EVERYONE TRIES TO GET OUT THERE BUT IT'S HARD TO CRAP WITH ALL THAT. AS A PARENT AND SOMETIMES THERE'S THEY JUST DON'T WANNA HURT THE CHILD'S IN THE OTHER ONE PROTECT THEM FROM THE BLOOD DRAWN SO YOU KNOW I'LL TAKE MY CHANCES BECAUSE I THINK. YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT GONNA. NOT WE'LL HAVE HIGH LEAD LEVELS IN OUR WATER OR PAINT OR WHATEVER. AND SO YOU KNOW FAIRLY CERTAIN I KNOW WE TRY TO WORK WITH THEM AND TRY TO CONVINCE THEM. BUT SOME PEOPLE ARE JUST GONNA. STUCK IN AND SAYING NOW SAYING NOW AND WE. NASA TO WATCH OUT FOR THEM FOR SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF LEAD BUTTON NEXT CITY FROM FROM THERE ON OUT AND HOPE THAT. THEY'RE CORRECT IN THE FIRST PLACE BUT. OKAY TO. ITS. IT'S PROBABLY DIFFICULT FOR YOU TO SAY WHAT PART OF THE NON COMPLIANCE IS FROM. PARENTS ARM JUST NOT THINKING ABOUT DOING THE TESTING OR PARENTS REFUSING TO DO THE TESTING OR DOCTOR REFUSING TO ASK. DO WE HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT THE BIGGEST PROBLEM MIGHT BE. THE OTHER SLAYER PRIDE I SHOULDN'T VENTURE INTO GUESSING WHICH ONES THERE'S THAT. NOW AVAILABILITY BY SUCCUMBS AND SO WHATEVER STANDS OUT TO ME I MIGHT I MIGHT OVER ESTIMATE SURE. THAT'S ONE AREA WHERE A P.. MAY BE USEFUL IN FIGURING OUT YOU KNOW HEY YOU KNOW FOR ASK A SWATH OF PEDIATRICIANS. YOU KNOW WHERE DO YOU SEE THE THINGS FALLING SHORT HUESO TESTS FALLING SHORT. KNOWS THAT BECAUSE PARENTS ARE NO IS BECAUSE PARENTS. TIPS PLANTED IT TOMORROW AND THEN YELL DOESN'T HAVE BETWEEN NOW AND THEN WE COULD WE COULD ASK THEM AND TRY TO FIGURE THAT PART OUT YOU KNOW IT'S A RELATIVELY SIMPLE SURVEY. IF YOU COULD DO THAT THAT BE GREAT. OKAY YET MY STAFF WILL FOLLOW UP WITH YOU THEN BEAT THAT WOULD BE VERY GOOD IT ALWAYS BEST TO DEFINE A PROBLEM YET. COULD HAVE DATA. YEAH. ALRIGHT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANKS FOR COMING ALL THE WAY UP AND. FOR OFFERING THAT THE SURVEY WHICH. IN AND OF ITSELF MAY JUST YOU KNOW POINT US IN THE RIGHT BALLPARK I DON'T EXPECT THAT. E. WE WITNESS. AT YOU. IF I DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF NUMBERS WE CAN GET BUT AT LEAST WE WOULD GET A SAMPLE OF VARIOUS DOCTORS AND. WHAT THEIR IMPRESSIONS ARE SAID THAT WOULD BE FULL? WE CAN GET NUMBERS THAT'S EVEN BETTER FAT. AGAIN THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND. LET'S TRY AND FIGURE OUT WHAT THE PROBLEM IS IN IF THERE'S ANYTHING THE DATA YOU ALL CAN DO WHERE. WE ALL CAN HELP HERE IN THE CAPITAL RIGHT THANK YOU INCLUDES. ALRIGHT. SO THE NEXT PANEL. IS A UNIQUE ONE WE'RE GOING TO TALK WITH. JOHN BATTERS. EV NIKA STEVENSON AND DAPHNE MACKLIN. AND THIS IS SORT OF A CITIZENS. RESPONSE. ARE. YOU COME UP TO SHARE THEIR PERSONAL STORIES I WITH CHILDHOOD TARA. BLOOD LEAD LEAD TESTING. AND IN ADDITION WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TESTIMONY FROM SEVERAL INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE GOING TO WHO COULD NOT ATTEND THE HEARING THAT'LL BE READ. I AND SUBMITTED TO OF HER TESTIMONY. I'M. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IF YOU COULD USE. ABOUT THREE OR FOUR MINUTES EACH. ARM FOR TOTAL OF TEN MINUTES FOR THE THREE OF YOU SAU. WHEN YOU OBVIOUSLY WE NOW KNOW WHO JOHN IS. AB NIKA COULD YOU RAISE YOUR HAND ARE AYE AND. DAPHNE. YES DAPHNE'S ON MY RIGHT HAVE NICK IN THE MIDDLE JOHN ON THE LEFT OKAY. WHO WOULD LIKE TO GO FIRST? OKAY WE'RE GOING TO TO HEAR FROM THE MAYOR. AND FARM. EMERYVILLE. WHICH IS JUST A FEW MILES FROM HAYWARD WHERE I LIVE. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR. INVITING US HERE TODAY MISTER CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND STAFF. HOW MANY MISS JOHN POWDERS I HAVE THE PLEASURE OF SERVING THE PEOPLE OF EVERY VILLAGE THEIR MER? AND I SERVICE THE CHAIR OF THE ALAMEDA COUNTY LEAD POISONING PREVENTION DISTRICT AND DEPARTMENT JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY. WHICH IS THE NATION'S FIRST MULTI DISCIPLINARY. LEAD POISONING TASK FORCE WAS FOUNDED IN NINETEEN NINETY ONE AND WE PROVIDE. SERIES OF INTERVENTIONS AND AGREE TO BE HELPED BY HEALTH CARE. ARE RELATED TO NURSING ENVIRONMENTAL. TOXIC REMEDIATION OF THE CASE MANAGEMENT SERVICES TO THE PEOPLE NAM IT ALAMEDA COUNTY. I ALAMEDA COUNTY'S CHILD ISN'T OF LEAD POISONING PREVENTION RATE IS. AVERAGES ABOUT SEVEN PERCENT. TO GIVE SOME CONTEXT OF THAT IN FLINT MICHIGAN WHICH MOST OF US ARE FAMILIAR WITH. THE CHILD LEAD POISONING RATE IS FIVE PERCENT. ON THE CITY OF EVERY BUILT SIX AND A HALF AND IN THE FRUITVALE IT IS ALMOST SEVEN AND A HALF. SO ARM LET ME GET THE NUMBERS STRAIGHT AGAIN SO FRUITVALE WAS SEVEN AND A HALF. EMERYVILLE WAS SIX. MICHIGAN WAS FIVE MICHIGAN IS. AND WHAT WAS THE FIRSTNUMBER IT WAS FOR ALAMEDA COUNTIES ME TO COUNTY ON THE WHOLE AVERAGES ABOUT SEVEN PERCENT. THAT'S SEVEN PERCENT YES SO. WE HAVE BIGGER PROBLEMS WE HAVE A VERY BIG PROBLEM. THE PROBLEM IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT IN TERMS OF THE SOURCE OF THE TOXICS. IT'S NOT GENERALLY RELATED TO WATER AS MOST PEOPLE ASSEMBLY LEAD POISONING TO BE DUE TO THE NEWS AROUND FLINT MICHIGAN. ON MARS IS MORE SOIL BASED. A BY PRODUCT OF PAST USES IN THE WESTERN PART OF ALAMEDA COUNTY NORTHERN ALAMEDA COUNTY. AS WELL AS. PAINT PAINT RELATED ISSUES. HOMES IN. UNDER INVESTED NEIGHBORHOODS AND COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE GONE IN DISREPAIR FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME. ARE ALSO A SOURCE OF LEAD. OUR DEPARTMENT SEES ABOUT THREE HUNDRED FIFTY CASES PER YEAR. BLOOD LAB LEAD LEVEL READING OF FIVE TO FIFTEEN MILLIGRAMS PER DECILITER. AUTOMATICALLY RESULTS IN A CASE MANAGEMENT FAMILY SERVICES PROGRAM BEING INITIATED WE HAVE ABOUT THIRTY FIVE TO FORTY CASES PER YEAR WHERE. THE CASE IS SO SEVERE CHILD HAS OVER A READING OF OVER FIFTEEN MILLIGRAMS PER DECILITER. IN THOSE CASES I WE DISPATCHING NURSE TO ASSIST THE FAMILY IN THE CHILD. THROUGH THERAPY AND TREATMENT FOR LEAD POISONING AND WE ALSO BY DISPATCHING ENVIRONMENTAL SPECIALIST TO THE HOME. TO IDENTIFY THE SOURCE AND REMEDIATE AS APPROPRIATE. OUT RECENTLY WE WE'VE BEEN GOING THROUGH A SITUATION WITH THE OAKLAND UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. AS PART OF REGULAR TESTING OAKLAND IDENTIFIED FORTY FIVE OF ITS SCHOOLS. ARE TESTED HIGHER THAN THE ALLOW CDC ALLOWABLE FIFTEEN PARTS PER BILLION FOR LEAD IN WATER. DOES NEIGHBORHOODS THAT I HAVE ALREADY MENTIONED WHERE ON THERE'S A HIGHER PREVALENCE OF EAD POISONING ALAMEDA COUNTY HAPPENED TO ALSO BE. HAVE SOME SIX SIGNIFICANT OVERLAP WITH PLACES WHERE THE SCHOOLS ARE LOCATED NOW THAT IS NOT TO SUGGEST THAT THE SCHOOLS ARE THE SOURCE FOR THAT ALONE. IT IS IT IS IT. ABUNDANCE OF THE TOXIC IN THE ENVIRONMENT. BUT WHAT WE FIND IN THOSE COMMUNITIES IS THAT MANY OF THE CHILDREN IN THOSE SCHOOLS ARE ON MEDI CAL. ON THEIR LOWER INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS AND COMMUNITIES AND SO THE NEED TO DO SCREENING. EARLIER REGULARLY. AND ACTUALLY MEET THOSE CHILDREN WHERE THEY'RE AT AND INFORM THEIR PARENTS OF THE IMPORTANCE OF BLOOD LEAD LEVEL TESTING. IS CRITICAL. AND I I KNOW IT WAS A FAN FAVORITE. LAST YEAR TO PROVIDE A COUPLE PIECES OF CONTEXT ABOUT HOW. LITTLE LEAD IS NEEDED TO ACTUALLY HARM A CHILD. BUT IF YOU CUT A PENNY. INTO A MILLION PIECES IT TAKES JUST TWO OF THOSE MILLION PIECES TO POISON A CHILD. AND IF YOU TOOK A PACK OF SUGAR. A LITTLE PICTURE YOU GET COFFEE AND IF I WAS TO SPRINKLE IT RANDOMLY ACROSS THIS ENTIRE ROOM AND WE WERE TO HAVE A CHILD. A TODDLER CRAWL ACROSS THIS ROOM THAT'S ABOUT HOW. DISPERSED IT NEEDS TO BE TO ACTUALLY COME INTO CONTACT WITH THE CHILD THAT'S HOW LITTLE YOU NEED IN THE ENVIRONMENT. TO BOTH BE IN A DANGEROUS SITUATION AND TO POISON A CHILD. AND SO ARE DEPARTMENT TAKES A LEAD POISONING VERY SERIOUSLY WE HAVE EXCELLENT STAFF. AND. EACH CITY IN THE JPA IS REPRESENTED ON THE BOARD. AND. WE WE'VE BEEN VERY ACTIVE IN. SUPPORTING THE GOOD WORK YOU IN THIS COMMITTEE HAVE DONE AND TRYING TO REMEDIATE LED FROM THE ENVIRONMENT WE SEE IT. IN ABUNDANCE UNFORTUNATELY IN OUR COUNTY AND SO. WE'RE HERE TO BE SUPPORTIVE AND JUST LET YOU KNOW THAT IT IS A REAL PROBLEM FOR CHILDREN OUR COMMUNITY. I JUST ONE QUICK QUESTION YOU SAID ABOVE FIFTEEN YOU SEND A NURSE OUT. WHAT DO YOU DO BETWEEN FIVE AND FIFTEEN WE DO CASE MANAGEMENT AND FAMILY SERVICES WHERE WE GUIDE? THE FAMILY THROUGH THE APPROPRIATE REFERRAL PROCESS BUT WE DO NOT PROVIDE THE DIRECT HEALTHCARE CELLS. OKAY. THANK YOU YOU'RE WELCOME ARM. GAFFNEY OR. MAY NAME IS STEPHANIE MACKLIN I'M. INSULTED BUT IF IT'S. ADVOCATE WITH. CALIFORNIA COALITION OF. A COALITION OF CALIFORNIA WELFARE RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS. MANY YEARS I WAS AN ATTORNEY WITH LEGAL SERVICES OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA SELLING MY SEMI RETIREMENT CLAIM BACK DOING ADVOCACY IS TO LOBBY HERE FOR THE ACLU. MY FAVORITE. OF. I. WAS PART OF A GROUP WHO IDENTIFIED SOME PEOPLE WHO WERE NOT ABLE TO TESTIFY. IN I WOULD SIMPLY LIKE TO READ THEIR STATEMENTS AND MAKE A FEW SHORT COMMENTS WITHOUT. FOLLOW VERY GOOD THANK YOU KING CATHERINE WHO LIVES IN EAST OAKLAND IS SUBMITTING HER WRITTEN TESTIMONY FOR THE RECORD. CATHERINE'S THE MOM OF A THREE YEAR OLD BOY NAMED ROBBIE. THEY RECENTLY FOUND OUT THAT ROBBIE HAS ELEVATED BLOOD LEAD LEVELS. THEIR HOME A SINGLE FAMILY RENTAL HOUSE IN EAST OAKLAND TESTED POSITIVE FOR LEAD BASED PAINT. DURING THE RAINY SEASON THE ROOF BEGAN LEAKING AND THE LANDLORD DID NOT FIX IT. THE WALLS BECAME SATURATED AND THE PAINT PEELED ALL ALONG THE BACK OF THE HOUSE. EVENTUALLY THE LANDLORD DID FIX THE ROOF LEAK BUT THEN DID THAT WE PAINT THE HOUSE. CATHERINE AND HER HUSBAND HAVE MADE MINOR REPAIRS THEMSELVES BECAUSE THE HOMELESS STILL AFFORDABLE BY OPEN STANDARDS FOURTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS OVER THE FIVE YEARS THAT THEY LIVE THERE. AND READ FOURTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH BUT THEY DID NOT KNOW ABOUT THE DANGERS OF POSSIBLE LEAD BASED PAINT. ROBBIE DID NOT SPEAK OR HAVE ANY EXPRESSION UNTIL HE WAS TWO YEARS OLD. WHEN THEY TESTED HIM FOR BLOOD BUT. SINCE THEN HE'S BEGUN TO DEVELOP BEHAVIORAL ISSUES SUCH AS HYPERACTIVITY AND SHORT ATTENTION SPAN. CATHERINE OFTEN CANNOT LEAVE A HOUSE ALONE WITH HIM BECAUSE HE TRIES TO RUN INTO TRAFFIC. DOCTORS WHO DIAGNOSED HIM WITH AUTISM AS WELL. CATHERINE SUFFERED DEPRESSION FOR MONTHS AFTER HIS DIAGNOSIS SAYING SHE BLAMED HERSELF AND FELT THAT THEIR LIVING CONDITIONS RUINED HIS LIFE. MEANWHILE THE LANDLORD HAS BEGUN TO HARASS THE FAMILY SHE TOLD CATHERINE THEY COULD STAND ANOTHER APARTMENT OF HERS RENT FREE WHILE THE HOUSE WAS REPAIRED. BUT ONLY IF CATHARINE SIGNS A STATEMENT THAT SAYS THE LAMB OR DISCLOSED INFORMATION TO THEM ABOUT THE HOUSES LEAD BASED PAINT BEFORE THEY MOVED IN WHICH SHE DID NOT. CATHERINE STRING TO FIGURE OUT HER RIGHTS AS A RENTER AND PROTECTOR FAMILY WHILE NAVIGATING HER SENSE THEIR PEAK AND STRUGGLING WITH FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES AS A RESULT OF HIS DIAGNOSIS. SHE HAD TO QUIT HER JOB TO CARE FOR HIM. THE. FAMILIES ONLY RECOURSE TRY TO HANG ON UNTIL THEY SAVE ENOUGH TO AFFORD A PLACE OF THEIR OWN ONE DAY. THIS KNOCKS TESTIMONY IS I'M JUST LET ME ASK A QUESTION YEAH. CATHERINE AND HER FAMILY OF GINO WHEN THEY STARTED TO GET LEAD TESTING. I DO NOT KNOW SHE DID NOT PUT THAT IN HER STATEMENT. I. WE APPARENTLY BAILEY FIGURE RATHER THREE YEARS I'M WONDERING IF IT ACTUALLY STARTED EARLIER BUT THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE TESTING DONE. WHEN I WOULD SAY IN MY EXPERIENCE AS A LEGAL SERVICES ATTORNEY IS IT'S NOT UNUSUAL FOR. OF FAMILY WITH YOUNG CHILDREN TO BE LIVING IN A HOME THAT THEY SEE IS AFFORDABLE BUT WHICH IS FUNDAMENTALLY AND SAFE. I'M HOME AND THAT AND IT WAS A LEGAL SERVICES ATTORNEY FOR LEGAL SERVICES OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA I COVERED THE SIX. OVER NORTHERN COUNTIES SO WERE LOOKING AT SIERRA PLASTER ELDORADO NEVADA AMADOR IN CALAVERAS I KNOW THAT AND THOSE COMMUNITIES THERE IS A GREAT DEAL OF OLDER HOUSING. PROBABLY WITH LEAD BASED PAINT WHICH IS NOT BEING REVIEWED ARE CONSIDERED. AND TOM WE REALLY STARTED THIS PROJECT AT CCW R. O. WHEN WE TOOK IT TOOK A LOOK AT INFORMATION FROM. THE LOS OPEC PACKARD FOUNDATION SPY KIDS COUNT AND THEY WERE A GREAT MANY RURAL COUNTIES THAT SIMPLY DID NOT HAVE ENOUGH DATA COLLECTED. SEVERAL OF THE STATISTICS AND THE BASELINE EXISTENCE OF THE PROBLEM IS. WAIT GREATER THAN ANYONE COULD HAVE IMAGINED THANK YOU ALL RIGHT YOU MAKE A HAD READ THE NEXT STATEMENT. THIS STATEMENT IS FROM A WOMAN NAMED DEBBIE WHO CONTACTED US. I AM FROM PLACERVILLE AND THEY'VE SUBMITTED MY WRITTEN TESTIMONY FOR THE RECORD. I RECENTLY RETIRED FROM SACRAMENTO COUNTY'S CHILDHOOD LEAD POISONING PREVENTION PROGRAM WHERE I SERVED AS AN ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH OFFICER. I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE LOW BLOOD TESTING AMONG MEDICAL TODDLERS AND PERSONALLY BELIEVE THAT ALL CHILDREN SHOULD BE TESTED BETWEEN THE AGES OF ONE AND TWO. WE MISSED SO MANY BY PRIMARILY TESTING THOSE ON PUBLIC ASSISTANCE AND ONLY TWENTY EIGHT PERCENT OF PEACE CHILDREN ARE TESTED ACCORDING TO THE COMMITTEE'S INFORMATION. THE QUESTIONNAIRE GIVEN BY DOCTORS TO ASSESS POTENTIAL LEAD EXPOSURE IN CHILDREN. DO YOU LIVE OR FREQUENTLY VISIT A PRE NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT HOME IS INADEQUATE. PARENTS DON'T THINK TO ANSWER YES TO REFLECT THE WEEKLY VISITS TO GRANDMA'S OR EVEN DAILY VISITS TO DAYCARE. NO ONE WANTS TO THINK THAT THESE VISITS COULD CAUSE A CHILD PROBLEMS. FREQUENTLY HOME REMEDIES MAKEUP SUMMER A COAL INC SACRAMENTO SPICES TO MERRICK IN SACRAMENTO. RITUAL ITEMS TWICE OTHER THINGS BROUGHT IN FROM OVERSEAS HAVE HIGH LEAD LEVELS. THIS IS MISSED ON THE QUESTIONNAIRE AND IN THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE SINCE LEAD POISONING OFTEN IS OFTEN SYMPTOM FREE A DAMAGING LEVELS AND IT'S NOT JUST PEOPLE ON PUBLIC ASSISTANCE THAT USE THESE ITEMS. HERE ARE A FEW EXAMPLES. WHAT? A SICK DOG BENNETT ASTUTE VETERINARIAN DIAGNOSED WITH LEAD POISONING. THE DOCKS FAMILY WAS THEN FOUND TO HAVE VERY HIGH BLOOD LEVEL. BUT LET LEVELS TO. A FAMILY WITH THE DEVELOPMENTALLY DELAYED CHILD TO THE DOCTOR TESTED FOR LEAD EXPOSURE ON A WHIM AND FOUND THE CHILD TO HAVE ELEVATED BLOOD LEAD LEVELS. WE FOUND THAT HIS MOTHER WAS GIVING HIM A HOME REMEDY THAT CONTAINED BOTH LEAD AND MERCURY MICA. CLANDESTINELY TESTED THE SOIL SOMEONE CLANDESTINELY TESTED THE SOIL IN A GARDEN IN A DOWNTOWN SACRAMENTO UPPER CLASS DAY CARE WHICH CARED FOR OVER ONE HUNDRED CHILDREN. AND FOUND THE SOIL TO BE A FIVE HUNDRED PARTS PER MILLION IN THE PLAY AREA HOWEVER THOSE CHILDREN WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN TESTED. I HAVE MANY MORE EXAMPLES. IN CONCLUSION I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THIS IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR THE COMMITTEE TO HASN'T IT TO HAVE CALLED THIS HEARING. ON LICENSES THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WAS ONCE VERY AGGRESSIVE AT LOOKING AT BLOOD BLOOD ISSUES. AND I THINK IT'S KIND OF FALLEN OFF THE MAP. ON A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO I DID A PRESENTATION TO THE STATE'S FIRST FIVE COMMISSION BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WAS CURIOUS ABOUT IS. WELL LET'S IMPORTANT* UP ON THE FIRST FIVE COMMISSION RIGHT. NO ONLY ABOUT TEN OF THE COMMISSION COUNTY COMMISSION WEBSITE HAD ANY INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT IT WAS OFTEN VERY HARD TO GET TO. THE STATE WIDE COMMISSION HAD NOTHING. I THINK THAT AS OF NICOLE WILL TESTIFY TO. THE MORE INFORMATION THAT CAN BE GIVEN TO PARENTS AND THE SOONER IN THEIR IN THEIR CHILD'S LIFE. EVEN PRENATALLY A SOME OF THE INFORMATION THAT I RESEARCH FOUND ON THE BETTER. ON THIS IS A VERY CRITICAL CONDITION AND. WE'VE JUST FORGOTTEN HOW SERIOUS IT IS. WELL FIRST OF ALL. MISS MACKLIN THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR YEARS WORKING FOR AS AN ADVOCATE THAT'S REALLY APPRECIATED AND THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THESE STORIES TO US. AND YOUR OBSERVATIONS. SO ARM TECHNIQUE AND. STEVENSON. PAYMENT OF MICAH STEVENSON I LIVE IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY ZIP CODE NINE FIVE EIGHT NINE FIVE EIGHT FOUR TO. I'M A STUDENT AT AMERICAN RIVER COLLEGE I HAVE FOUR CHILDREN. THREE OF MY CHILDREN ARE GIRLS WHO ARE UNDER AGE FIVE. MY CHILDREN I GET HEALTH CARE COVERAGE TO MEDI CAL ARC PROVIDERS KAISER. THAT CHILDREN HAVE BEEN TO MULTIPLE APPOINTMENTS WITH PEDIATRICIANS AT KAISER. I DO NOT RECALL WHAT TESTING BEING DISCUSSED AS PART OF THEIR CARE UNTIL EACH OF THE CHILDREN WERE ABOUT ONE ONE YEARS OLD. EVEN WHEN BLOOD LEAD TEST SCREENING IS BROUGHT UP DURING A CONVERSATION DURING THE TWELVE MONTH OLD BABY APPOINTMENT THERE WAS NO DETAILS GET BANNED Y. THE BLOOD LET SCREENING AS RECOMMENDED. I WAS JUST TOLD THAT. THE CHILD WAS NOW AT THE AGE TO BE TESTED FOR LEAD AND THE DOCTORS WHAT'S UNDER REQUEST TO THE KAISER LAB FOR TESTING. THERE WAS NO REAL FOLLOW UP I GOT THE SAME INFORMATION. FROM WAKE. AS A PARENT I WAS TOLD THAT LAB. THE LAB TESTS. REQUIRED WAS PENDING BUT I WAS NOT GIVEN ANY SPECIFIC INFORMATION AND I WAS NOT REALLY GIVEN ANY INFORMATION. THAT WOULD HELP ME IDENTIFIED MY CHILD AS AT RISK FOR LEAD POISONING. I FEEL THAT AS A PARENT I SHOULD BE PROVIDED WITH BETTER DETAILED INFORMATION ABOUT THE RISKS OF LEAD POISONING AND THE IMPORTANCE OF WHAT SCREENINGS. FOR VERY YOUNG CHILDREN. AND I DO ALSO HAVE AT. FROM. BOB LET ME JUST ASK SO WHAT. BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF INFORMATION DID YOU DELAY GETTING THE TEST DONE NOT OF MY CHILD. AND TESTED FOR LEAD. IT WAS NEVER BROUGHT UP BACK IN CONVERSATION EVEN UP TO THERE'D TWO YEARS CHECKUPS WE'LL GET IT NOW. I WOULD BEING THAT I KNOW MORE. MORE INFORMATION ABOUT LED SCREENING BECAUSE I'VE LEARNED THREE RESEARCH BUT I. WHAT? HOW THEY PRESENT MOST HOW KAISER PRESENT SO I DON'T THINK A LOT OF? FAMILIES NO. AS TO WHAT THE RISKS ARE AND WHY WE'RE NEEDING TO THE KIDS TO BE TESTED OKAY. BUT YOU WILL GET IT NOW. AND THE OTHER THING THAT I PROVIDING AS IS WITH THE DIFFERENT WAYS THAT CAN BE TESTED WERE GIVEN AN OPTION TO WHERE THEY SAY THE ONLY WAY THEY CAN BE TESTED AS. AS LIKE WITH A BANG PUNCTURE AND WITH TODDLERS IT'S REALLY HARD TO. MOVEMENT SIT STILL THROUGH BATON TO MY UNDERSTANDING THERE SHOULD BE OTHER WAYS OF GETTING THAT TESTING. WELL WE HAD QUESTIONS ABOUT THE ACCURACY OF OUR PIN* TESTS. SO. WELL GET MORE INFORMATION ON THAT AS TIME GOES ON A GO AHEAD AND AND RETURN NEXT CASE. VICTORIA IS SOMEONE WHO LIVES IN OAKLAND WHO SUMMONING HER WRITTEN TESTIMONY FOR RECORD FOR TODAY'S HEARING.

AT HER DAUGHTER'S TWELVE MONTH WELL BABY CHECK VICTORIA ONE* EXPLAINED THAT USES A CLINIC THAT ACCEPTS MEDI CAL THAT IS LOCATED NEAR CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL. AS IT IS NEAR SOME OF THE OTHER MEDICAL PROVIDERS THAT USES FOR HER DAUGHTER. TORIA B.

THIS CHILD IS NOW THIRTEEN AND HER FAMILY NOW LIVES IN THE FRESNO AREA WHERE VICTORIA BE AND HER DAUGHTER LIVE FOR SEVERAL MONTHS. CONCERNING FRESNO VICTORIA BE EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT WHILE LIVING WITH HER MOTHER IN A SECTION EIGHT RENTAL. SHE NOTED THAT THE UNIT HAD. PEELING PAINT THAT WAS A POTENTIAL SOURCE OF LEAD EXPOSURE TO HER DAUGHTER. TORIA B. ONE ASK STATED SHE FELL INFORMATION ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF BLOOD LET'S KING SHOULD BE PROVIDED BY MEDICAL PROVIDERS. AS EARLY AS DURING PRENATAL CARE SO THAT MOTHERS AND PARENTS ARE ABLE TO HAVE GOOD QUALITY INFORMATION ABOUT THE RISKS POSTED BY LED EXPOSURES TO INFANTS AND YOUNG. YOUNG CHILDREN. THANK YOU. HARM.

A FIRST I WANT TO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR HOLDING THIS HEARING THIS WAS A GREAT ENDEAVOR. AND I KNOW TO A LOT OF YOUR TIME AND RESOURCES TO DO SO SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'M MY NAME SUSAN LITTLE I'M WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL WORKING GROUP. AND. WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE. THE COMMITTEE FOR QUITE AWHILE ON THIS ISSUE AND I ALSO WANTED JUSTICE HAD. GIVE KUDOS TO THE COMMITTEE STAFFER SPENDING SO MUCH TIME IN TRYING TO IDENTIFY. THE ACCURATE MET. MEDICARE LEAD TESTING RATES. IT TOOK QUITE A LOT OF WORK WITH THE DIFFERENT AGENCIES OR REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR TIME TO DO THIS TO DO SO. ON. ONE THING THAT HAS COME TO MIND IN ALL OF THIS DISCUSSION IS JUST THAT THE NEED TO ENGAGE THE PARENTS IN THE PUBLIC MORE IN. THE SERVICES THAT THEY RECEIVE I HEARD A LOT OF CONVERSATION OF BETWEEN. THE AGENCIES ABOUT COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THEMSELVES AND THE PROVIDERS BUT NOT A LOT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT COMMUNICATION WITH THE ACTUAL PARENTS. WHO AND I THINK THAT THOSE FOLKS ARE ACTUALLY THERE OF COURSE THE ONES OF THE MOST INVESTED IN THEIR CHILDREN'S WELFARE? SO. WE WOULD LIKE TO SUGGEST THAT IN AN ERA WHEN WE HAVE OUR UPS AND COMPUTER PROGRAMS THAT TRACK. OUR EVERY MOVE OUR FOOT STEPS ARE CALORIE COUNTS. ARE. CREDIT SCORES ARE SPENDING HABITS. THAT WE COULD POSSIBLY AND DEVELOP A PROGRAM OR IMPROVE THE PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE. TO ALLOW THESE THE THE MEDICAL CHILDREN SERVICES TO BE TRACKED AND THEN PARENTS TO BE ALERTED WHEN POSSIBLY THEY MISS. ONE OF THEIR SERVICES THAT THAT IT THAT IS REALLY NEEDED. AND SO ON ANYWAY THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD LIKE EVERYBODY TO KIND THINK ABOUT. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE WITH YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
