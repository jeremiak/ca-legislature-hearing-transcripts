FIRST OF ALL LITIGATION IS

00:55:55.585 --> 00:55:58.121
EXTRAORDINARILY EXPENSIVE FOR

JUDGMENTS HAVE PRECEDENTIAL

00:56:21.878 --> 00:56:25.448
VALUE. SO A BAD JUDGMENT FOR THE

00:56:25.515 --> 00:56:27.183
STATE OF CALIFORNIA CAN RESULT

00:56:27.250 --> 00:56:29.119

ARBITRATION- DOES NOT HAVE

00:56:35.358 --> 00:56:38.328
PRECEDENTIAL VALUE- SO THAT IS A

00:56:38.394 --> 00:56:41.431
SIGNIFICANT SAVINGS OF FOR THE-

00:56:41.498 --> 00:56:42.832
