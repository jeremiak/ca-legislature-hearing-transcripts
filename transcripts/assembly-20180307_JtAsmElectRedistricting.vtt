COMMITTEE.

00:30:19.251 --> 00:30:21.486 region:rollup2
SINCE THE TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN

00:30:20.519 --> 00:30:22.988 region:rollup2
ELECTIONS THERE'S BEEN AN

00:30:21.486 --> 00:30:24.856 region:rollup2
INCREASED FOCUS ON ELECTION

00:30:22.988 --> 00:30:26.825 region:rollup2
SECURITY NON THE INCREASINGLY

00:30:24.856 --> 00:30:28.527 region:rollup2
SOPHISTICATED THREATS POSED TO

00:30:26.825 --> 00:30:29.328 region:rollup2
OUR ELECTION SYSTEMS.

00:30:28.527 --> 00:30:31.029 region:rollup2
A LARGE PART OF THAT INCREASE

00:30:29.328 --> 00:30:32.898 region:rollup2
FOCUS IS A DIRECT RESPONSE TO

00:30:31.029 --> 00:30:34.399 region:rollup2
THE WELL DOCUMENTED EFFORTS THAT

00:30:32.898 --> 00:30:35.801 region:rollup2
THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT UNDERTOOK

00:30:34.399 --> 00:30:36.635 region:rollup2
IN AN ATTEMPT TO INFLUENCE THE

00:30:35.801 --> 00:30:39.137 region:rollup2
TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN

00:30:36.635 --> 00:30:39.771 region:rollup2
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.

00:30:39.137 --> 00:30:41.606 region:rollup2
ACCORDING TO THE UNITED STATES

00:30:39.771 --> 00:30:42.407 region:rollup2
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY THOSE

00:30:41.606 --> 00:30:43.942 region:rollup2
EFFORTS REPRESENTED A

00:30:42.407 --> 00:30:45.677 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT ESCALATION BY THE

00:30:43.942 --> 00:30:46.712 region:rollup2
RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT OVER PREVIOUS

00:30:45.677 --> 00:30:48.513 region:rollup2
ATTEMPTS TO INTERFERE WITH OUR

00:30:46.712 --> 00:30:49.915 region:rollup2
NATION'S ELECTIONS.

00:30:48.513 --> 00:30:51.650 region:rollup2
AND INTELLIGENCE OFFICIALS

00:30:49.915 --> 00:30:53.185 region:rollup2
WARNED THAT RUSSIA AND BULLDOG

00:30:51.650 --> 00:30:54.352 region:rollup2
EMBOLDENED BY THE LACK OF A

00:30:53.185 --> 00:30:55.654 region:rollup2
STRONG RESPONSE BY THE TRUMP

00:30:54.352 --> 00:30:56.688 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION TO ITS

00:30:55.654 --> 00:30:58.223 region:rollup2
INTERFERENCE IN THE TWO THOUSAND

00:30:56.688 --> 00:31:00.292 region:rollup2
SIXTEEN ELECTION.

00:30:58.223 --> 00:31:02.594 region:rollup2
IS CONTINUING TO INTERFERE WITH

00:31:00.292 --> 00:31:04.129 region:rollup2
U. S. ELECTIONS THIS YEAR.

00:31:02.594 --> 00:31:05.664 region:rollup2
HEARING CALIFORNIA VOTERS HAVE

00:31:04.129 --> 00:31:07.733 region:rollup2
RECEIVED CONFLICTING AND

00:31:05.664 --> 00:31:08.767 region:rollup2
CONFUSING INFORMATION ABOUT

00:31:07.733 --> 00:31:09.768 region:rollup2
WHETHER OUR ELECTIONS RELATED

00:31:08.767 --> 00:31:10.502 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS WERE THE TARGET OF

00:31:09.768 --> 00:31:13.105 region:rollup2
RUSSIAN ATTACKS.

00:31:10.502 --> 00:31:14.206 region:rollup2
TWENTY SIXTEEN.

00:31:13.105 --> 00:31:15.307 region:rollup2
AND WELL IT APPEARS THAT RUSSIAN

00:31:14.206 --> 00:31:17.609 region:rollup2
OPERATIVES MAY HAVE TRIED TO

00:31:15.307 --> 00:31:19.544 region:rollup2
TEST THE SECURITY OF SOME STATE

00:31:17.609 --> 00:31:21.179 region:rollup2
WEBSITES IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN

00:31:19.544 --> 00:31:22.647 region:rollup2
OUR SECRETARY OF STATE. WHO WE

00:31:21.179 --> 00:31:24.282 region:rollup2
WILL HEAR FROM SHORTLY ASSURES

00:31:22.647 --> 00:31:25.517 region:rollup2
US THAT THERE IS NO EVIDENCE

00:31:24.282 --> 00:31:27.519 region:rollup2
THAT CALIFORNIA'S ELECTIONS

00:31:25.517 --> 00:31:28.420 region:rollup2
RELATED SYSTEMS WERE BREACHED IN

00:31:27.519 --> 00:31:29.588 region:rollup2
ANY WAY?

00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:30.889 region:rollup2
WHILE RUSSIA'S ATTEMPTS TO

00:31:29.588 --> 00:31:31.523 region:rollup2
INFLUENCE ELECTIONS HAVE

00:31:30.889 --> 00:31:33.291 region:rollup2
RECEIVED A GREAT DEAL OF PUBLIC

00:31:31.523 --> 00:31:34.292 region:rollup2
ATTENTION THEY'RE NOT THE ONLY

00:31:33.291 --> 00:31:34.893 region:rollup2
SOURCE OF POTENTIAL CYBER

00:31:34.292 --> 00:31:37.129 region:rollup2
ATTACKS WERE ELECTIONS

00:31:34.893 --> 00:31:38.330 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE.

00:31:37.129 --> 00:31:39.931 region:rollup2
AND TODAY'S HEARING IS NOT

00:31:38.330 --> 00:31:41.366 region:rollup2
INTENDED TO BE A FORM FOR

00:31:39.931 --> 00:31:43.702 region:rollup2
EVALUATING WHETHER RUSHES

00:31:41.366 --> 00:31:44.870 region:rollup2
EFFORTS HAD ANY EFFECT ON THE

00:31:43.702 --> 00:31:46.671 region:rollup2
OUTCOME OF THE ELECTION. IN TWO

00:31:44.870 --> 00:31:48.106 region:rollup2
THOUSAND SIXTEEN.

00:31:46.671 --> 00:31:50.108 region:rollup2
INSTEAD IT THE PURPOSE OF THIS

00:31:48.106 --> 00:31:51.643 region:rollup2
HEARING IS TO HAVE A MORE FORMAL

00:31:50.108 --> 00:31:53.311 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION ABOUT ELECTION

00:31:51.643 --> 00:31:55.113 region:rollup2
SECURITY IN ORDER TO HELP

00:31:53.311 --> 00:31:57.115 region:rollup2
PROMOTE A THOUGHTFUL AND FACTUAL

00:31:55.113 --> 00:31:58.417 region:rollup2
ASSESSMENT. OF HOW CALIFORNIA

00:31:57.115 --> 00:32:00.585 region:rollup2
CAN DEAL WITH THE EVOLVING

00:31:58.417 --> 00:32:01.853 region:rollup2
THREATS TO OUR ELECTION SYSTEM.

00:32:00.585 --> 00:32:03.021 region:rollup2
PART OF THAT DISCUSSION WILL

00:32:01.853 --> 00:32:04.689 region:rollup2
INVOLVE AN EXAMINATION OF

00:32:03.021 --> 00:32:06.758 region:rollup2
CURRENT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

00:32:04.689 --> 00:32:07.292 region:rollup2
THAT CALIFORNIA HAS IN PLACE TO

00:32:06.758 --> 00:32:09.127 region:rollup2
COMBAT THREATS TO ELECTION

00:32:07.292 --> 00:32:10.295 region:rollup2
INTEGRITY.

00:32:09.127 --> 00:32:11.930 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE WHILE FOURTEEN

00:32:10.295 --> 00:32:13.465 region:rollup2
STATES STILL USE PAPERLESS

00:32:11.930 --> 00:32:14.966 region:rollup2
VOTING SYSTEMS ALLEY SOME

00:32:13.465 --> 00:32:16.635 region:rollup2
JURISDICTIONS

00:32:14.966 --> 00:32:17.702 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA'S* PROHIBITED THE

00:32:16.635 --> 00:32:19.805 region:rollup2
USE OF SUCH SYSTEMS FOR MORE

00:32:17.702 --> 00:32:21.606 region:rollup2
THAN A DECADE.

00:32:19.805 --> 00:32:22.674 region:rollup2
SIMILARLY CALIFORNIA HAS LONG

00:32:21.606 --> 00:32:23.742 region:rollup2
STANDING PROHIBITIONS AGAINST

00:32:22.674 --> 00:32:25.944 region:rollup2
VOTING SYSTEMS BEING CONNECTED

00:32:23.742 --> 00:32:27.512 region:rollup2
TO THE INTERNET. HAVING WIRELESS

00:32:25.944 --> 00:32:28.647 region:rollup2
COMMUNICATIONS CAPABILITIES OR

00:32:27.512 --> 00:32:31.216 region:rollup2
OTHERWISE CONNECTING TO PUBLIC

00:32:28.647 --> 00:32:31.750 region:rollup2
COMMUNICATIONS NETWORKS IN ORDER

00:32:31.216 --> 00:32:34.186 region:rollup2
TO PROTECT AGAINST REMOTE

00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:36.421 region:rollup2
ATTACKS TO THOSE SYSTEMS.

00:32:34.186 --> 00:32:38.190 region:rollup2
IN FACT CALIFORNIA EVEN HAS ITS

00:32:36.421 --> 00:32:40.559 region:rollup2
OWN VOTING SYSTEM TESTING AND

00:32:38.190 --> 00:32:41.860 region:rollup2
CERTIFICATION STANDARDS THAT

00:32:40.559 --> 00:32:42.360 region:rollup2
EXCEED THE VOLUNTARY STANDARDS

00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:44.296 region:rollup2
DEVELOPED BY THE FEDERAL

00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:44.863 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT.

00:32:44.296 --> 00:32:45.831 region:rollup2
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT

00:32:44.863 --> 00:32:47.566 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA'S ELECTIONS

00:32:45.831 --> 00:32:48.667 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE IS A MUNIFICENT

00:32:47.566 --> 00:32:50.202 region:rollup2
WITH THREATS AND SAFEGUARDING

00:32:48.667 --> 00:32:51.736 region:rollup2
THE INTEGRITY OF OUR ELECTIONS

00:32:50.202 --> 00:32:54.706 region:rollup2
WILL REQUIRE PROACTIVE EFFORTS

00:32:51.736 --> 00:32:55.207 region:rollup2
BY FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL

00:32:54.706 --> 00:32:56.741 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND

00:32:55.207 --> 00:32:57.676 region:rollup2
OFFICIALS.

00:32:56.741 --> 00:32:59.177 region:rollup2
SOME OF THOSE EFFORTS ARE

00:32:57.676 --> 00:33:00.846 region:rollup2
ALREADY UNDERWAY INCLUDING A ONE

00:32:59.177 --> 00:33:01.346 region:rollup2
HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR MILLION

00:33:00.846 --> 00:33:02.380 region:rollup2
DOLLAR COMMITMENT BY THE

00:33:01.346 --> 00:33:03.448 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR OF STE.

00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:04.883 region:rollup2
OF STATE FUNDING TO REPLACE

00:33:03.448 --> 00:33:06.618 region:rollup2
OUTDATED VOTING EQUIPMENT ACROSS

00:33:04.883 --> 00:33:07.719 region:rollup2
THE STATE.

00:33:06.618 --> 00:33:08.887 region:rollup2
AND I'M HOPING THAT TODAY'S

00:33:07.719 --> 00:33:12.290 region:rollup2
HEARING WILL HELP US DETERMINE

00:33:08.887 --> 00:33:12.924 region:rollup2
OTHER STEPS THAT WE CAN TAKE TO

00:33:12.290 --> 00:33:14.226 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO ENSURE THE SECURITY

00:33:12.924 --> 00:33:15.227 region:rollup2
OF OUR ELECTIONS.

00:33:14.226 --> 00:33:16.161 region:rollup2
IN PUTTING TOGETHER THE AGENDA

00:33:15.227 --> 00:33:17.696 region:rollup2
FOR TODAY'S HEARING IN THE

00:33:16.161 --> 00:33:19.030 region:rollup2
PRIMARY FOCUS WAS ON THREATS TO

00:33:17.696 --> 00:33:20.398 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA'S ELECTION

00:33:19.030 --> 00:33:22.234 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE.

00:33:20.398 --> 00:33:24.803 region:rollup2
IN OTHER WORDS TODAY'S HEARING

00:33:22.234 --> 00:33:25.637 region:rollup2
WON'T BE TOO HEAVILY FOCUSED ON

00:33:24.803 --> 00:33:26.938 region:rollup2
SOCIAL MEDIA PROPAGANDA THAT'S

00:33:25.637 --> 00:33:29.507 region:rollup2
DESIGNED TO HELP ONE CANDID IT

00:33:26.938 --> 00:33:30.141 region:rollup2
OR HURT ANOTHER.

00:33:29.507 --> 00:33:31.576 region:rollup2
THAT MAY BE A TOPIC FOR A FUTURE

00:33:30.141 --> 00:33:32.878 region:rollup2
HERE.

00:33:31.576 --> 00:33:34.145 region:rollup2
BUT THE TWO ISSUES ARE NOT

00:33:32.878 --> 00:33:36.081 region:rollup2
COMPLETELY SEVER ONES AND I

00:33:34.145 --> 00:33:36.615 region:rollup2
EXPECT THAT THERE WILL BE SOME

00:33:36.081 --> 00:33:37.415 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION TODAY ABOUT THE

00:33:36.615 --> 00:33:38.583 region:rollup2
THREAT OF.

00:33:37.415 --> 00:33:41.286 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE THREAT TO PUBLIC

00:33:38.583 --> 00:33:42.454 region:rollup2
CONFIDENCE IN OUR DEMOCRACY WHEN

00:33:41.286 --> 00:33:45.090 region:rollup2
VOTERS RECEIVE MISLEADING OR

00:33:42.454 --> 00:33:47.759 region:rollup2
INACCURATE INFORMATION ABOUT THE

00:33:45.090 --> 00:33:49.060 region:rollup2
ACCURACY OF ELECTION RESULTS.

00:33:47.759 --> 00:33:49.594 region:rollup2
WE HAVE A VERY DISTINGUISHED

00:33:49.060 --> 00:33:50.896 region:rollup2
GROUP OF PARTICIPANTS FOR

00:33:49.594 --> 00:33:51.463 region:rollup2
TODAY'S HEARING.

00:33:50.896 --> 00:33:53.198 region:rollup2
AND AFTER WE HEAR FROM THE

00:33:51.463 --> 00:33:54.499 region:rollup2
WITNESSES ON THE AGENDA WILL

00:33:53.198 --> 00:33:55.333 region:rollup2
HAVE TIME FOR PUBLIC COMMENT

00:33:54.499 --> 00:33:56.468 region:rollup2
FROM THOSE IN THE AUDIENCE.

00:33:55.333 --> 00:33:58.303 region:rollup2
AND ANYBODY WISHING TO TESTIFY

00:33:56.468 --> 00:33:59.571 region:rollup2
DURING THE PUBLIC TESTIMONY

00:33:58.303 --> 00:34:00.572 region:rollup2
PORTION OF THE AGENDA SHOULD

ARMS. RIGHT OVER THERE.

00:34:02.107 --> 00:34:04.809 region:rollup2
BUT BEFORE WE GET TO THE WITNESS

00:34:03.775 --> 00:34:05.810 region:rollup2
IS ON THE AGENDA A LIKE TO

00:34:04.809 --> 00:34:07.479 region:rollup2
INVITE MY CULTURE FOR TODAY'S

00:34:05.810 --> 00:34:09.381 region:rollup2

ISSUE FORWARD.

00:34:15.020 --> 00:34:18.857 region:rollup2
.

00:34:16.788 --> 00:34:20.425 region:rollup2
THIS IS AN IMPORTANT TIME TO

CALIFORNIA. WE PRETTY GOOD

00:34:39.611 --> 00:34:43.148 region:rollup2
CYCLE.

00:34:42.647 --> 00:34:44.516 region:rollup2
COMPARE TO THE REST THIS

00:34:43.148 --> 00:34:45.917 region:rollup2
COUNTRY.

00:34:44.516 --> 00:34:47.686 region:rollup2
SOME OF IT WAS BECAUSE OF.

00:34:45.917 --> 00:34:48.620 region:rollup2
.

00:34:47.686 --> 00:34:52.557 region:rollup2
REAL LEADERSHIP.

00:34:48.620 --> 00:34:54.526 region:rollup2
IT IN IN OUR SYSTEMS AND AND

00:34:52.557 --> 00:34:55.994 region:rollup2
VIGILANCE AND A AND A SORT OF.

00:34:54.526 --> 00:34:57.495 region:rollup2
A WILLINGNESS TO MODERNIZE BUT

00:34:55.994 --> 00:35:00.632 region:rollup2
SOME OF IT IS LOW TECH

00:34:57.495 --> 00:35:03.268 region:rollup2
SOME OF IT ISABOUT OUR

00:35:00.632 --> 00:35:03.435 region:rollup2
WILLINGNESS IS A STATE.

00:35:03.268 --> 00:35:04.970 region:rollup2
TO.

00:35:03.435 --> 00:35:06.137 region:rollup2
.

00:35:04.970 --> 00:35:08.239 region:rollup2
DISCONNECT FROM THE INTERNET AND

00:35:06.137 --> 00:35:09.641 region:rollup2
TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR VOTING

00:35:08.239 --> 00:35:11.910 region:rollup2

00:35:09.641 --> 00:35:14.245 region:rollup2
OUR ON SITE

00:35:11.910 --> 00:35:14.679 region:rollup2
CURE WITH PAPER TRAILS THAT WE

00:35:14.245 --> 00:35:14.980 region:rollup2
CAN ACTUALLY AUDIT.

00:35:14.679 --> 00:35:18.516 region:rollup2
.

00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:21.319 region:rollup2
AND INTERESTINGLY THAT THAT

00:35:18.516 --> 00:35:22.687 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY IS BROUGHT SOME MODICUM

00:35:21.319 --> 00:35:23.154 region:rollup2
OF OF SECURITY INTEREST I THINK

00:35:22.687 --> 00:35:23.588 region:rollup2
BACK TO THE CALIFORNIA

00:35:23.154 --> 00:35:24.289 region:rollup2
ELECTORATE.

00:35:23.588 --> 00:35:26.424 region:rollup2
BUT OF COURSE IT'S OUR DUTY HERE

00:35:24.289 --> 00:35:29.661 region:rollup2
IN THE IN THE LEGISLATURE TO

00:35:26.424 --> 00:35:32.364 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO KICK THE TIRES AND I

00:35:29.661 --> 00:35:33.832 region:rollup2
THINK.

00:35:32.364 --> 00:35:35.266 region:rollup2
DESPITE OUR BEST EFFORTS SYSTEMS

00:35:33.832 --> 00:35:36.901 region:rollup2
GET ALL. AND ITS EQUIPMENT GETS

00:35:35.266 --> 00:35:37.802 region:rollup2
OLD AND SO WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT

00:35:36.901 --> 00:35:39.671 region:rollup2
NOW IS HOW TO SORT OF ADAPT THAT

00:35:37.802 --> 00:35:43.141 region:rollup2
HARD INFRASTRUCTURE.

00:35:39.671 --> 00:35:45.076 region:rollup2
INTO THE MODERN ERA.

00:35:43.141 --> 00:35:46.344 region:rollup2
BEYOND SAY WINDOWS TWO THOUSAND.

00:35:45.076 --> 00:35:47.912 region:rollup2

TWENTIES.

00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:51.449 region:rollup2
AND AND BEYOND THAT I THINK

00:35:50.815 --> 00:35:53.885 region:rollup2
WE'LL HEAR A LITTLE MORE ABOUT

00:35:51.449 --> 00:35:55.387 region:rollup2

00:35:55.387 --> 00:36:00.225 region:rollup2
A LOT OF DISTRUST OUT THERE AND

00:35:57.055 --> 00:36:01.259 region:rollup2
AND AGAIN ACKNOWLEDGING WHAT WE

00:36:00.225 --> 00:36:01.660 region:rollup2
PROBABLY CANNOT SOLVE TODAY

00:36:01.259 --> 00:36:02.594 region:rollup2
WHICH IS THE SOFT

00:36:01.660 --> 00:36:05.630 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE.

00:36:08.366 --> 00:36:11.503 region:rollup2
REALLY CAN'T BE PINNED DOWN IN

00:39:57.829 --> 00:40:00.265 region:rollup2
COUPLE OF YEARS AS SECRETARY.

00:39:58.763 --> 00:40:03.167 region:rollup2
YES

00:40:00.265 --> 00:40:05.570 region:rollup2
ACKNOWLEDGING MATTERS.

00:40:03.167 --> 00:40:07.538 region:rollup2
YES PARTNERSHIPS MATTER.

00:40:05.570 --> 00:40:08.606 region:rollup2
POLICY MATTERS.

00:40:07.538 --> 00:40:11.109 region:rollup2
EQUALLY IMPORTANT

00:40:08.606 --> 00:40:14.178 region:rollup2
IN ALL THIS.

00:40:11.109 --> 00:40:17.315 region:rollup2
CYBER VOCABULARY.

00:40:14.178 --> 00:40:18.983 region:rollup2
PUT SIMPLY WORDS MATTER.

00:40:17.315 --> 00:40:21.452 region:rollup2
WHEN WE ARE PRECISE

00:40:18.983 --> 00:40:23.421 region:rollup2
OUR TERMINOLOGY.

00:40:21.452 --> 00:40:24.522 region:rollup2
OR A MEDIA REPORTS.

00:40:23.421 --> 00:40:27.091 region:rollup2
.

00:40:24.522 --> 00:40:28.026 region:rollup2
WE.

00:40:27.091 --> 00:40:29.794 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE TERMINOLOGY THAT WERE

00:40:28.026 --> 00:40:31.529 region:rollup2
USING IN OUR DISCUSSION.

00:40:29.794 --> 00:40:33.164 region:rollup2
WE CANNOT.

00:40:31.529 --> 00:40:34.932 region:rollup2
EASILY GO FROM HAVING

00:40:33.164 --> 00:40:35.733 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTIVE DIALOGUE.

00:40:34.932 --> 00:40:37.735 region:rollup2
TWO VERY COUNTERPRODUCTIVE

00:40:35.733 --> 00:40:39.203 region:rollup2
DIALOGUE

00:40:37.735 --> 00:40:43.007 region:rollup2
I KEEP A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES.

00:40:39.203 --> 00:40:45.209 region:rollup2
THE TERM HACK.

00:40:43.007 --> 00:40:47.178 region:rollup2
FAR TOO OFTEN IT IS USED AT THE

00:40:45.209 --> 00:40:50.448 region:rollup2
BLANKET TERM TO REFER TO A RANGE

00:40:47.178 --> 00:40:53.785 region:rollup2
OF ACTIVITIES OR EVENTS.

00:40:50.448 --> 00:40:55.887 region:rollup2
PERFECTLY A HACK IS DEFINED AS.

00:40:53.785 --> 00:40:57.488 region:rollup2
UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS.

00:40:55.887 --> 00:40:59.991 region:rollup2
TO AN INFORMATION SYSTEM WHERE

00:40:57.488 --> 00:41:02.994 region:rollup2
INFORMATION IS MANIPULATED OR

00:40:59.991 --> 00:41:05.229 region:rollup2
STOLEN.

00:41:02.994 --> 00:41:07.799 region:rollup2
TERMS HACK OR HACKED.

00:41:05.229 --> 00:41:10.335 region:rollup2
OR HACKING ARE OFTEN ERRONEOUSLY

00:41:07.799 --> 00:41:11.469 region:rollup2
USE TO DESCRIBE OTHER INCIDENTS

00:41:10.335 --> 00:41:12.203 region:rollup2
AND A WHAT WE'VE READ ABOUT LAST

00:41:11.469 --> 00:41:14.539 region:rollup2
SEVERAL MONTHS IS.

00:41:12.203 --> 00:41:17.342 region:rollup2
SCANNING.

00:41:14.539 --> 00:41:19.043 region:rollup2
RIGHT SCAMMING IS MORE SPECIFIC

00:41:17.342 --> 00:41:21.045 region:rollup2
SCANNING IS WHEN AN AND ENTITY

00:41:19.043 --> 00:41:22.680 region:rollup2
PINGS ON ONLINE SYSTEM FOR A

00:41:21.045 --> 00:41:24.882 region:rollup2
WEAKNESS.

00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:26.250 region:rollup2
SCANNING IS THE EQUIVALENT OF

00:41:24.882 --> 00:41:27.318 region:rollup2
SOMEBODY HAVE YOU KNOW WALKING

00:41:26.250 --> 00:41:29.320 region:rollup2
UP AND DOWN THE STREETS ARE

00:41:27.318 --> 00:41:30.121 region:rollup2
SHAKEN SOME GATES.

00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:31.155 region:rollup2
TO SEE WHO'S HOMEOWNER WHO'S

00:41:30.121 --> 00:41:33.825 region:rollup2
THAT OR WHICH CATER LOCKED OR

00:41:31.155 --> 00:41:35.593 region:rollup2
UNLOCKED.

00:41:33.825 --> 00:41:36.928 region:rollup2
PUBLIC AND PRIVATE ENTITIES

00:41:35.593 --> 00:41:38.229 region:rollup2
WITH ALL MY PRESENTS EXPERIENCE

00:41:36.928 --> 00:41:39.964 region:rollup2
SCANNING.

00:41:38.229 --> 00:41:41.999 region:rollup2
EVERY SINGLE DAY.

00:41:39.964 --> 00:41:43.701 region:rollup2
AGAIN THIS IS JUST THE REALITY

00:41:41.999 --> 00:41:45.503 region:rollup2
THAT WE LIVE IN TODAY.

00:41:43.701 --> 00:41:47.572 region:rollup2
ANOTHER EXAMPLE.

00:41:45.503 --> 00:41:49.307 region:rollup2
OF IT AND AND MAYBE PART OF

00:41:47.572 --> 00:41:51.175 region:rollup2
FRAME TODAY'S HEARING IN THE

00:41:49.307 --> 00:41:53.478 region:rollup2
FOLLOWING CONTEXT I'VE OBSERVED.

00:41:51.175 --> 00:41:55.646 region:rollup2
THREE.

00:41:53.478 --> 00:41:57.048 region:rollup2
SEMI RELATED DYNAMICS GOING ON

00:41:55.646 --> 00:41:58.583 region:rollup2
AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL BUT AS WE

00:41:57.048 --> 00:42:00.351 region:rollup2
STOP AND CONSIDER EACH THAT ARE

00:41:58.583 --> 00:42:02.320 region:rollup2
THERE REALLY DISTINCT.

00:42:00.351 --> 00:42:03.921 region:rollup2
IN OF THE TOPIC UP HERE TODAY AS

00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:05.323 region:rollup2
ARTICULATED MISTER CHAIRMAN IS

00:42:03.921 --> 00:42:06.657 region:rollup2
VOTING SYSTEMS IN CALIFORNIA

IT'S SECURE ARE NOT.

WAS IT.

00:42:08.559 --> 00:42:12.497 region:rollup2
BREACHED

00:42:10.528 --> 00:42:14.298 region:rollup2
COMPROMISED IN TWENTY SIXTEEN

00:42:12.497 --> 00:42:15.800 region:rollup2
ARE NOT AND THE ANSWER IS NO.

00:42:14.298 --> 00:42:18.302 region:rollup2
THAT'S VERY DIFFERENT THAN.

00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:20.238 region:rollup2
WAS THERE.

00:42:18.302 --> 00:42:20.738 region:rollup2
WHAT IS ART ARE GOING?

00:42:20.238 --> 00:42:23.708 region:rollup2
ASSERTED MISINFORMATION

00:42:20.738 --> 00:42:25.376 region:rollup2
CAMPAIGN.

00:42:23.708 --> 00:42:26.778 region:rollup2
BACON DUCTED BY AGENTS OF THE

RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT.

00:42:26.778 --> 00:42:30.681 region:rollup2
VETERANS ABSOLUTELY YES.

00:42:29.213 --> 00:42:32.216 region:rollup2
THE COUPLE WEEKS AGO YOU SAW THE

00:42:30.681 --> 00:42:34.419 region:rollup2
IT AND NOT SORT OF INDICTMENT OF

00:42:32.216 --> 00:42:35.053 region:rollup2
THIRTEEN INDIVIDUALS.

00:42:34.419 --> 00:42:36.053 region:rollup2
RIGHT AND THAT INDICTMENT LATER

00:42:35.053 --> 00:42:37.155 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:42:36.053 --> 00:42:38.289 region:rollup2
AND THERE'S MORE AND IT'S

00:42:37.155 --> 00:42:39.624 region:rollup2
CONTINUE.

00:42:38.289 --> 00:42:41.292 region:rollup2
BUT THAT'S VERY DIFFERENT THAN

00:42:39.624 --> 00:42:42.894 region:rollup2
THE QUESTION OF WAS THERE A BOOK

00:42:41.292 --> 00:42:43.628 region:rollup2
CHIANG DROVE A TALLY.

00:42:42.894 --> 00:42:44.862 region:rollup2
THAT WAS.

00:42:43.628 --> 00:42:46.064 region:rollup2
.

00:42:44.862 --> 00:42:48.232 region:rollup2
ABOUT MANIPULATED

00:42:46.064 --> 00:42:49.700 region:rollup2
CHOOSE NOT.

00:42:48.232 --> 00:42:51.068 region:rollup2
THIRD LOT OF PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW

00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:52.336 region:rollup2
WHO WAS THERE WAS ARE NOT

00:42:51.068 --> 00:42:54.639 region:rollup2
COLLUSION BETWEEN WILL.

00:42:52.336 --> 00:42:56.274 region:rollup2
A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE OR HIS.

00:42:54.639 --> 00:42:56.574 region:rollup2
FOR HER CAMPAIGN AND THE RUSSIAN

00:42:56.274 --> 00:42:58.443 region:rollup2

WELL LET.

00:42:58.443 --> 00:43:01.145 region:rollup2
MOLLER WHO COME TO CONCLUSIONS

00:42:59.811 --> 00:43:02.747 region:rollup2
ON THAT

00:43:01.145 --> 00:43:04.182 region:rollup2
CLEARLY THREE DIFFERENT ITEMS

00:43:02.747 --> 00:43:05.650 region:rollup2
RIGHT BUT AS WATCH THE CABLE

00:43:04.182 --> 00:43:06.918 region:rollup2
NEWS AT NIGHT THE STORYLINES

00:43:05.650 --> 00:43:08.586 region:rollup2
TEND TO GET BLURRED.

00:43:06.918 --> 00:43:11.289 region:rollup2
SO GET TO MY POINT CYBER

00:43:08.586 --> 00:43:13.091 region:rollup2
VOCABULARY MATTERS.

00:43:11.289 --> 00:43:15.460 region:rollup2
VOCABULARY IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE

PUBLIC PERCEPTION.

00:43:15.460 --> 00:43:19.130 region:rollup2
IT'S JUST AS IMPORTANT AS THE

00:43:17.395 --> 00:43:21.165 region:rollup2
REALITY OF WHAT DID OR DID NOT

00:43:19.130 --> 00:43:23.401 region:rollup2

DISSERVICE.

00:43:26.437 --> 00:43:29.073 region:rollup2
IT UNDERMINES THE CONFIDENCE

00:43:27.738 --> 00:43:31.709 region:rollup2
THAT PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE.

00:43:29.073 --> 00:43:33.611 region:rollup2

THE SECRETARY SIX ELECTIONS.

00:58:57.300 --> 00:59:00.303 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS ARE NOT ON THE STATE'S

00:58:58.335 --> 00:59:01.405 region:rollup2
GENERAL NETWORK.

00:59:00.303 --> 00:59:02.606 region:rollup2
EXCEPT IT WAS SCAMMING ACTIVITY

00:59:01.405 --> 00:59:04.274 region:rollup2
GOING ON IT WAS THE STATE'S

00:59:02.606 --> 00:59:05.475 region:rollup2
GENERAL NETWORK.

00:59:04.274 --> 00:59:07.177 region:rollup2
WHICH ARE ELECTIONS ELEMENTS ARE

00:59:05.475 --> 00:59:07.744 region:rollup2

FOR THIS PRECISE REASON FOR

00:59:07.744 --> 00:59:10.747 region:rollup2
SECURITY.

00:59:08.378 --> 00:59:13.116 region:rollup2
SO.

00:59:10.747 --> 00:59:13.717 region:rollup2
TWO ITEMS ABOUT THAT FOLK OFTEN

00:59:13.116 --> 00:59:14.484 region:rollup2
HOW MUCH COULD WESTERN NUMBER

00:59:13.717 --> 00:59:16.153 region:rollup2
ONE.

00:59:14.484 --> 00:59:16.753 region:rollup2
A COMMITTEE YEAR TO TELL US THAT

RIGHT THE TIMELINESS IS THE

00:59:19.122 --> 00:59:22.225 region:rollup2
CONCERN THERE.

00:59:20.223 --> 00:59:22.826 region:rollup2
TO GET BETTER.

00:59:22.225 --> 00:59:24.928 region:rollup2
NUMBER TWO THE QUALITY OF THE

00:59:22.826 --> 00:59:27.030 region:rollup2
IN.

00:59:24.928 --> 00:59:28.165 region:rollup2
RIGHT SEWER I GET.

00:59:27.030 --> 00:59:29.599 region:rollup2
AT OF A RESPONSIBILITY TO BE

A CLEAR ABOUT WHAT DID WHAT DID

00:59:32.269 --> 00:59:36.673 region:rollup2
NOT HAPPEN. WILL BE HACKED NO

00:59:34.337 --> 00:59:38.241 region:rollup2
WAS OUR SCANNING. YES SCARY

00:59:36.673 --> 00:59:39.176 region:rollup2
THOUGHT HACK OF RECKLESS GETTING

00:59:38.241 --> 00:59:39.843 region:rollup2
HAPPENS EVERYDAY.

00:59:39.176 --> 00:59:40.444 region:rollup2
AND IT HAPPENS TO THE. UP A TON

00:59:39.843 --> 00:59:43.246 region:rollup2
OF FOLKS.

00:59:40.444 --> 00:59:44.614 region:rollup2
.

00:59:43.246 --> 00:59:47.617 region:rollup2
LESSON LEARNED FROM THAT IS THE

00:59:44.614 --> 00:59:49.219 region:rollup2
THE NEED TO A IMPROVE UPON THE

00:59:47.617 --> 00:59:50.454 region:rollup2

OR NOW TO LOCALS ANDA THAT'S

00:59:58.295 --> 01:00:03.733 region:rollup2
BEGINNING TO HAPPEN.

YOU KNOW SOME PEOPLE SAID LOOK

01:01:46.036 --> 01:01:49.673 region:rollup2
THERE'S JUST VALUE IN DATA

01:01:47.537 --> 01:01:51.041 region:rollup2
MINING RIGHT. ON THE DARK NET

01:01:49.673 --> 01:01:52.642 region:rollup2
BAD ACTORS.

01:01:51.041 --> 01:01:54.244 region:rollup2
IDENTITY THEFT THAT CETERA.

01:01:52.642 --> 01:01:55.245 region:rollup2
AND TOOK.

01:01:54.244 --> 01:01:56.780 region:rollup2
THAT DRIVES A LOT OF THE

01:01:55.245 --> 01:01:59.482 region:rollup2
ACTIVITY SEPARATE APART FROM

01:01:56.780 --> 01:02:01.918 region:rollup2

IN OUR DEMOCRACY BUT THAT'S A

01:02:06.656 --> 01:02:09.326 region:rollup2
VERY VERY CLEAR OBJECTIVE.

01:02:08.091 --> 01:02:11.561 region:rollup2
AND JUST THE SHEER FACT THAT

01:02:09.326 --> 01:02:12.862 region:rollup2
WE'RE HAVING THIS HEARING.

01:02:11.561 --> 01:02:14.664 region:rollup2
THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT THE

RUSSIANS HAVE SUCCEEDED IN PART.

01:02:14.664 --> 01:02:19.069 region:rollup2

NOT RECEIVING ANY STATE OR

EACH COUNTY HOUSE TO UP WITH

01:04:05.508 --> 01:04:10.080 region:rollup2

RESULTED IN A KIND OF AN

01:35:38.933 --> 01:35:41.936 region:rollup2
INNOVATIVE.

01:35:39.767 --> 01:35:43.471 region:rollup2
APPROACH TO USING RESOURCES

01:35:41.936 --> 01:35:44.973 region:rollup2
THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY AVAILABLE A

01:35:43.471 --> 01:35:46.474 region:rollup2
WEST VIRGINIA HAS BROUGHT IN A

01:35:44.973 --> 01:35:47.942 region:rollup2
NATIONAL GUARD MEMBER AS A

01:35:46.474 --> 01:35:49.277 region:rollup2
MEMBER OF THEIR ELECTIONS TEAM

01:35:47.942 --> 01:35:51.479 region:rollup2
TO SIT IN THE STATE FUSION

01:35:49.277 --> 01:35:52.880 region:rollup2
CENTER. I'D MONITOR THAT THE

01:35:51.479 --> 01:35:54.315 region:rollup2
CYBERSECURITY AROUND ELECTIONS

01:35:52.880 --> 01:35:56.217 region:rollup2
PROCESS THAT'S AN INTERESTING I

01:35:54.315 --> 01:35:56.985 region:rollup2
INNOVATIVE APPROACH ARE ANOTHER

01:35:56.217 --> 01:35:58.653 region:rollup2
ONE IN.

01:35:56.985 --> 01:36:00.955 region:rollup2
IS THE STATE OF COLORADO.

01:35:58.653 --> 01:36:02.924 region:rollup2
IT IMPLEMENTED THE FIRST

01:36:00.955 --> 01:36:04.192 region:rollup2
STATEWIDE WRIST LIMITING AUDITS.

01:36:02.924 --> 01:36:04.792 region:rollup2
.

01:36:04.192 --> 01:36:06.127 region:rollup2
BUT THE FIRST STATEWIDE WRIST

01:36:04.792 --> 01:36:07.061 region:rollup2
LIMITING AUDITS A WRESTLING

01:36:06.127 --> 01:36:07.895 region:rollup2
AUDITS ARE.

01:36:07.061 --> 01:36:10.331 region:rollup2
NEW.

01:36:07.895 --> 01:36:11.232 region:rollup2
EFFICIENT PERCHED AUDITING I

01:36:10.331 --> 01:36:12.900 region:rollup2
THINK THERE'S PROBABLY MANY

01:36:11.232 --> 01:36:15.637 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT WAYS TO APPROACH

01:36:12.900 --> 01:36:15.837 region:rollup2
AUDITING A. IS BUT A COLORADO ON

01:36:15.637 --> 01:36:18.506 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:36:15.837 --> 01:36:19.674 region:rollup2
LARGE SCALE THE STATEWIDE AUDIT.

01:36:18.506 --> 01:36:21.175 region:rollup2
WAS ABLE TO CONDUCT REALLY

01:36:19.674 --> 01:36:22.577 region:rollup2
EFFICIENT AUDITS THE PROVIDED A

01:36:21.175 --> 01:36:24.145 region:rollup2
GREAT DEAL OF TRANSPARENCY IN

01:36:22.577 --> 01:36:25.780 region:rollup2
CONFIDENCE AND SO I WAS OUT

01:36:24.145 --> 01:36:26.848 region:rollup2
THERE TO WITNESS IT AND IT WAS.

01:36:25.780 --> 01:36:27.949 region:rollup2
A REALLY.

01:36:26.848 --> 01:36:30.585 region:rollup2
ONE COOL.

01:36:27.949 --> 01:36:32.487 region:rollup2
TO WATCH BUT REALLY INFORMATIVE.

01:36:30.585 --> 01:36:32.987 region:rollup2
NOW THE KEY FOR COLORADO IS ARE

01:36:32.487 --> 01:36:34.789 region:rollup2
THERE ENTIRELY SENSUALLY

01:36:32.987 --> 01:36:35.957 region:rollup2
COUNTED.

01:36:34.789 --> 01:36:37.258 region:rollup2
STATEWIDE AND SO THAT ALLOWS

01:36:35.957 --> 01:36:38.693 region:rollup2
FOR FLEXIBILITY ON HOW THEY

01:36:37.258 --> 01:36:40.395 region:rollup2
CONDUCT AUDITS AND SO ONE ONE

01:36:38.693 --> 01:36:42.063 region:rollup2
SOLUTION ELECTIONS DOESN'T SERVE

01:36:40.395 --> 01:36:43.164 region:rollup2
ALL EIGHT THOUSAND JURISDICTIONS

01:36:42.063 --> 01:36:44.832 region:rollup2
ARE BUT THERE'S A LOT TO BE

01:36:43.164 --> 01:36:47.302 region:rollup2
LEARNED FROM WHAT THEY GET OUT

01:36:44.832 --> 01:36:48.936 region:rollup2
THERE IN COLORADO FOR SURE.

01:36:47.302 --> 01:36:49.671 region:rollup2
COLORADO SEEMS TO BE A WE WE'VE

WORKING ON ON INFORMING

01:38:32.740 --> 01:38:34.509 region:rollup2
JOURNALISTS.

01:38:33.074 --> 01:38:35.243 region:rollup2
ABOUT THESE.

01:38:34.509 --> 01:38:36.577 region:rollup2
I TERMS AND AND IT JUST

01:38:35.243 --> 01:38:38.746 region:rollup2

VOCABULARY SURE SO THAT SO I

01:38:38.746 --> 01:38:40.982 region:rollup2
THINK IT'S FANTASTIC QUESTION IN

01:38:40.348 --> 01:38:43.985 region:rollup2
AND.

01:38:40.982 --> 01:38:44.819 region:rollup2
THE ACCURACY AND AND.

01:38:43.985 --> 01:38:46.220 region:rollup2
PURSE

01:38:44.819 --> 01:38:47.955 region:rollup2
PRECISION OF OUR OWN.

01:38:46.220 --> 01:38:49.791 region:rollup2
TERMINOLOGY WILL HELP DRIVE THE

01:38:47.955 --> 01:38:50.725 region:rollup2
WAY THAT THAT FOLKS PUBLICLY

01:38:49.791 --> 01:38:52.894 region:rollup2
TALK ABOUT WHETHER IT'S THE

01:38:50.725 --> 01:38:54.195 region:rollup2
MEDIA VOTERS OR OTHERS AND SO I

01:38:52.894 --> 01:38:56.097 region:rollup2
A REALLY SIMPLE EXAMPLE THAT

01:38:54.195 --> 01:38:57.899 region:rollup2
THAT ALL OF YOU I'M SURE OF

01:38:56.097 --> 01:38:59.167 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE. IS THE COMPLETION

01:38:57.899 --> 01:39:00.268 region:rollup2
BETWEEN VOTING SYSTEM AND VOTER

01:38:59.167 --> 01:39:01.869 region:rollup2
REGISTRATION SYSTEM ELECTION

01:39:00.268 --> 01:39:03.471 region:rollup2
SYSTEM.

01:39:01.869 --> 01:39:06.107 region:rollup2
THE VOTING SYSTEM IS NOT THE

01:39:03.471 --> 01:39:07.441 region:rollup2
VOTER REGISTRATION SYSTEM

01:39:06.107 --> 01:39:09.777 region:rollup2
THEY'RE NOT ONE IN THE SAME AYE

01:39:07.441 --> 01:39:10.278 region:rollup2
MANY CASES THEY'RE NOT IN ANY

01:39:09.777 --> 01:39:11.712 region:rollup2
WAY CONNECTED AT ALL.

01:39:10.278 --> 01:39:13.080 region:rollup2
BUT WHEN THE HEADLINE SCREAMS

01:39:11.712 --> 01:39:14.649 region:rollup2
VOTING SYSTEM HACKED IT IMPLIES

01:39:13.080 --> 01:39:16.717 region:rollup2
THAT THE TABULATION OR OR.

01:39:14.649 --> 01:39:17.785 region:rollup2
VOTE TOTALS WERE WERE HACKED

01:39:16.717 --> 01:39:19.253 region:rollup2
WHEN IN FACT WHAT WE SAW IN

01:39:17.785 --> 01:39:20.354 region:rollup2
TWENTY SIXTEEN WAS THE TARGET OF

01:39:19.253 --> 01:39:22.557 region:rollup2
VOTER REGISTRATIONS.

01:39:20.354 --> 01:39:24.725 region:rollup2
AND SO THAT VERY IMPORTANT ODD

01:39:22.557 --> 01:39:26.360 region:rollup2
DISTINCTION EYES ONE THAT VOTERS

01:39:24.725 --> 01:39:27.962 region:rollup2
AYE IN AND SOMETIMES THE MEDIA

01:39:26.360 --> 01:39:29.630 region:rollup2
DON'T OFTEN MAKE THAT WE NEED TO

01:39:27.962 --> 01:39:30.698 region:rollup2
REINFORCE AS A COMMUNITY. ARE

01:39:29.630 --> 01:39:32.066 region:rollup2
THAT THE THERE ARE A LOT OF THAT

01:39:30.698 --> 01:39:34.001 region:rollup2
ELECTION NIGHT REPORTING SYSTEM

01:39:32.066 --> 01:39:35.703 region:rollup2
IS NOT THE SAME AS THE VOTING

01:39:34.001 --> 01:39:35.970 region:rollup2
SYSTEM THESE ARE THESE ARE ALL

01:39:35.703 --> 01:39:39.273 region:rollup2
SEPARATE.

01:39:35.970 --> 01:39:40.274 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES DEPENDENT SOMETIMES

01:39:39.273 --> 01:39:41.209 region:rollup2
NOT DEPENDENT SYSTEMS AND THE

01:39:40.274 --> 01:39:42.276 region:rollup2
WAY WE TALK ABOUT THESE NEEDS TO

01:39:41.209 --> 01:39:43.811 region:rollup2
BE DONE WITH PRECISION ASA THAT

01:39:42.276 --> 01:39:45.847 region:rollup2
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

01:39:43.811 --> 01:39:47.448 region:rollup2
THE RIGHT SYSTEMS AND THE RIGHT

01:39:45.847 --> 01:39:49.150 region:rollup2
TYPE OF ACTIVITY ARE THAT WAS OR

01:39:47.448 --> 01:39:50.551 region:rollup2
WASN'T GOING ON ALL THE OTHER

01:39:49.150 --> 01:39:52.787 region:rollup2
PART OF THAT IS TRANSPARENCY THE

01:39:50.551 --> 01:39:54.222 region:rollup2
BEST WAY. I THINK ABOUT THAT I

01:39:52.787 --> 01:39:55.456 region:rollup2
KNOW HERE IN CALIFORNIA YOU ALL

01:39:54.222 --> 01:39:57.592 region:rollup2
I HAVE.

01:39:55.456 --> 01:39:58.759 region:rollup2
O. LAWS THAT SUPPORT.

01:39:57.592 --> 01:40:00.928 region:rollup2
VOTER ENGAGEMENT AND

STEPS. THAT FOLKS ARE TAKING IS

01:49:35.469 --> 01:49:38.038 region:rollup2
TOUGH BECAUSE THE REALITY IS ARE

01:49:37.204 --> 01:49:40.040 region:rollup2
THAT FOR MANY GOVERNMENT

01:49:38.038 --> 01:49:41.508 region:rollup2

EVERYTHING'S OKAY RIGHT AND SO

01:49:45.379 --> 01:49:48.215 region:rollup2
WHAT YOU NEED TO SOME THIRD

01:50:40.467 --> 01:50:42.603 region:rollup2
FLORIDA THEY CERTIFY THEIR OWN

01:50:41.668 --> 01:50:44.371 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS MUCH LIKE HERE IN

01:50:42.603 --> 01:50:46.173 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA BUT THEY USE OUR

01:50:44.371 --> 01:50:47.708 region:rollup2
STANDARDS AS AS. I.

01:50:46.173 --> 01:50:49.276 region:rollup2
WHAT A A CORE AT THE CORE OF HOW

01:50:47.708 --> 01:50:51.245 region:rollup2
THEY TEST AND EVALUATE THE

01:50:49.276 --> 01:50:52.079 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS ARE OTHER STATES WILL

01:50:51.245 --> 01:50:52.646 region:rollup2
USE OUR TEST LABS WOULD HAVE

01:50:52.079 --> 01:50:53.947 region:rollup2
THEIR OWN?

01:50:52.646 --> 01:50:55.015 region:rollup2
STANDARDS BY WHICH THEY

01:50:53.947 --> 01:50:56.383 region:rollup2
EVALUATE IT BECAUSE WE ARE

01:50:55.015 --> 01:50:58.151 region:rollup2

CALIFORNIA SECRETARY STATE

01:51:14.334 --> 01:51:17.371 region:rollup2
THAT CALIFORNIA WAS DOING SO

01:51:15.769 --> 01:51:18.939 region:rollup2
YEAH ABSOLUTELY CALIFORNIA I HAS

01:51:17.371 --> 01:51:20.173 region:rollup2
FOR YEARS NOW BEEN BEEN

01:51:18.939 --> 01:51:21.108 region:rollup2
EVALUATING AND AND.

01:51:20.173 --> 01:51:22.643 region:rollup2
INNOVATING AROUND HOW THEY TEST

01:51:21.108 --> 01:51:23.277 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS

01:51:22.643 --> 01:51:24.311 region:rollup2
CREATE ONE LAST QUESTION BECAUSE

01:51:23.277 --> 01:51:26.079 region:rollup2
I KNOWWE GOT TO KEEP MOVING BUT

01:51:24.311 --> 01:51:27.147 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE DESIGNATION OF

01:51:26.079 --> 01:51:29.416 region:rollup2
ELECTION SYSTEM IS CRITICAL

01:51:27.147 --> 01:51:31.652 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE IN JANUARY DHS.

01:51:29.416 --> 01:51:32.953 region:rollup2
IDEA WHAT IMPACT YOU THINK IT'S

01:51:31.652 --> 01:51:34.254 region:rollup2
GOING TO HAVE THE DESIGNATION

01:51:32.953 --> 01:51:35.355 region:rollup2
MEAN WE USE THIS CRITICAL

01:51:34.254 --> 01:51:37.991 region:rollup2
CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE

01:51:35.355 --> 01:51:39.326 region:rollup2
DESIGNATION FOR THE POWER GRID

01:51:37.991 --> 01:51:40.427 region:rollup2
OR OTHERS ARE SENSITIVE SYSTEMS

01:51:39.326 --> 01:51:42.529 region:rollup2
THAT WILL HAVE AN IMPACT ON

01:51:40.427 --> 01:51:43.630 region:rollup2
NATIONAL SECURITY BUT. TO CENTER

01:51:42.529 --> 01:51:44.364 region:rollup2
AROUND POINT EARLY HE MENTIONED

01:51:43.630 --> 01:51:46.300 region:rollup2
THIS IS A MATTER OF NATIONAL

01:51:44.364 --> 01:51:48.168 region:rollup2
DEFENSE NOW WE'VE ACTUALLY

01:51:46.300 --> 01:51:51.471 region:rollup2
IDENTIFIED ELECTION SYSTEMS

01:51:48.168 --> 01:51:53.273 region:rollup2
THROUGH DHS AS CRITICAL

01:51:51.471 --> 01:51:53.540 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE SO. IF YOU'RE

01:51:53.273 --> 01:51:54.274 region:rollup2
GONNA BE.

01:51:53.540 --> 01:51:56.310 region:rollup2
IT IN IT DO YOU SEE ANY

01:51:54.274 --> 01:51:58.245 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL IMPACT THEIR IN ANY

01:51:56.310 --> 01:51:58.946 region:rollup2
MEANINGFUL WAY YEAH I DO AT VERY

01:51:58.245 --> 01:52:00.247 region:rollup2
MUCH ON I KNOW.

01:51:58.946 --> 01:52:01.114 region:rollup2
NEIL KELLY'S CAN SPEAK TO THIS

01:52:00.247 --> 01:52:03.317 region:rollup2
AS WELL BUT.

01:52:01.114 --> 01:52:05.052 region:rollup2
THAT THE TWO MAJOR AREAS OF

01:52:03.317 --> 01:52:06.486 region:rollup2
IMPACT ARE ONE. THAT INFORMATION

01:52:05.052 --> 01:52:07.087 region:rollup2
SHARING SO THIS IS GOING TO

01:52:06.486 --> 01:52:09.756 region:rollup2
PROVIDE.

01:52:07.087 --> 01:52:11.491 region:rollup2
INEFFICIENT AVENUE TOWARDS.

01:52:09.756 --> 01:52:12.793 region:rollup2
TIMELY AND ACTIONABLE

01:52:11.491 --> 01:52:14.127 region:rollup2
INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION BEING

01:52:12.793 --> 01:52:15.662 region:rollup2
SHARED WITH ELECTION OFFICIALS

01:52:14.127 --> 01:52:16.997 region:rollup2
THAT OTHERWISE WASN'T AVAILABLE

01:52:15.662 --> 01:52:18.398 region:rollup2
TO THEM PREVIOUSLY.

01:52:16.997 --> 01:52:19.733 region:rollup2
THAT THAT THAT IS THE MAIN

01:52:18.398 --> 01:52:20.601 region:rollup2
FOCUS OF WHAT'S HAPPENING WITHIN

01:52:19.733 --> 01:52:22.235 region:rollup2
THE CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE

01:52:20.601 --> 01:52:24.638 region:rollup2
SECTOR AND I THINK IT'S

01:52:22.235 --> 01:52:25.772 region:rollup2
ABSOLUTELY VITAL ARE THAT

01:52:24.638 --> 01:52:26.406 region:rollup2
ELECTION OFFICIALS HAVE THAT

01:52:25.772 --> 01:52:28.442 region:rollup2
INFORMATION FOR WHAT KIND OF

01:52:26.406 --> 01:52:29.042 region:rollup2
INFORMATION IS SHORT SO I ATE A

01:52:28.442 --> 01:52:31.945 region:rollup2
COULD BE EVERYTHING FROM JUST

01:52:29.042 --> 01:52:34.881 region:rollup2
GENERAL CYBER THREAT INFORMATION

01:52:31.945 --> 01:52:36.883 region:rollup2
SO. THAT WITHIN THE EIGHTEEN

01:52:34.881 --> 01:52:37.884 region:rollup2
AREAS A CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE

01:52:36.883 --> 01:52:39.186 region:rollup2
DO YOU MAY SEE ACTIVITY IN THE

01:52:37.884 --> 01:52:40.120 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL SECTOR OR ELECTRICAL

01:52:39.186 --> 01:52:42.256 region:rollup2
SECTOR THAT CAN HELP INFORM THE

01:52:40.120 --> 01:52:44.157 region:rollup2
ELECTION SECTOR OR COULD BE. ARE

01:52:42.256 --> 01:52:44.424 region:rollup2
MUCH LIKE WHAT WE SAW IN TWENTY

01:52:44.157 --> 01:52:45.125 region:rollup2
SIXTEEN.

01:52:44.424 --> 01:52:46.994 region:rollup2
PACIFIC INDICATORS ARE THAT WERE

01:52:45.125 --> 01:52:48.762 region:rollup2
PROVIDED BY THE FBI DHS DOWN THE

01:52:46.994 --> 01:52:49.930 region:rollup2
LOCAL ELECTION OFFICIALS ABOUT

01:52:48.762 --> 01:52:50.964 region:rollup2
THREATS FACING THEIR SYSTEMS

01:52:49.930 --> 01:52:52.499 region:rollup2
THAT THEY ELECTION OFFICIALS

01:52:50.964 --> 01:52:54.001 region:rollup2
COULD GO BACK AND LOOK. AT THEIR

01:52:52.499 --> 01:52:56.103 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS AND SAY HAVE WE SEEN ANY

01:52:54.001 --> 01:52:57.137 region:rollup2
OF THESE IF SO WHAT HAPPENED ALL

01:52:56.103 --> 01:52:59.339 region:rollup2
WHAT WENT ON IN SO THAT'S THAT'S

01:52:57.137 --> 01:53:01.908 region:rollup2
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT AND WILL

01:52:59.339 --> 01:53:03.443 region:rollup2
RECEIVE THAT INFORMATION I MEAN.

01:53:01.908 --> 01:53:05.012 region:rollup2
EXPLAIN REALLY BRIEF THE FLOW SO

01:53:03.443 --> 01:53:07.080 region:rollup2
IT SURE STATE WHERE WHATEVER ANY

01:53:05.012 --> 01:53:08.849 region:rollup2
DETECTS THE THREAT HOW HOW WOULD

01:53:07.080 --> 01:53:11.418 region:rollup2
THEN MAKE ITS WAY. BACK TO

01:53:08.849 --> 01:53:12.819 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA YET SO SO THE IDEA

01:53:11.418 --> 01:53:13.654 region:rollup2
WOULD BE EACH STATE'S GONNA HAVE

01:53:12.819 --> 01:53:15.422 region:rollup2
TO KIND OF FIGURE OUT THEIR BEST

01:53:13.654 --> 01:53:16.757 region:rollup2
MODE OF COMMUNICATION AS FAR AS

01:53:15.422 --> 01:53:18.425 region:rollup2
GETTING IT ALL THE WAY OUT TO

01:53:16.757 --> 01:53:19.760 region:rollup2
THE YOU KNOW THE THE LOCAL. OF

01:53:18.425 --> 01:53:20.927 region:rollup2
THE SMALLEST OF LOCALS RIGHT

01:53:19.760 --> 01:53:22.629 region:rollup2
BECAUSE EACH STATE IS DIFFERENT

01:53:20.927 --> 01:53:24.231 region:rollup2
IN HOW THEY COMMUNICATE ACROSS

01:53:22.629 --> 01:53:25.532 region:rollup2
THE COUNTY SOME STATES HAVE MORE

01:53:24.231 --> 01:53:26.500 region:rollup2
CENTRALIZED CONTROL SOME.

01:53:25.532 --> 01:53:28.502 region:rollup2
STATES DON'T BUT THE IDEAS THAT

01:53:26.500 --> 01:53:31.138 region:rollup2
THERE ARE STATE LOCAL POINTS OF

01:53:28.502 --> 01:53:33.040 region:rollup2
CONTACT IN EVERY OUR ELECTION.

01:53:31.138 --> 01:53:34.207 region:rollup2
JURISDICTION IN EVERY STATE ARE

01:53:33.040 --> 01:53:35.275 region:rollup2
THAT AS INFORMATION BECOMES

01:53:34.207 --> 01:53:37.044 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE THERE SOMETHING CALLED

01:53:35.275 --> 01:53:39.279 region:rollup2
THE MULTI STATE INFORMATION

01:53:37.044 --> 01:53:40.781 region:rollup2
SHARING AND ANALYSIS CENTER MSI

01:53:39.279 --> 01:53:42.449 region:rollup2
SACK ROLLS OFF THE RIGHT SUPER

01:53:40.781 --> 01:53:43.316 region:rollup2
ANOTHER ACRONYM WERE HERE FOR

01:53:42.449 --> 01:53:44.751 region:rollup2
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WE'RE

01:53:43.316 --> 01:53:48.055 region:rollup2
HERE TO HELP RIGHT.

01:53:44.751 --> 01:53:49.356 region:rollup2
AND THE MSI SACK IS DESIGNED

01:53:48.055 --> 01:53:50.991 region:rollup2
AND BUILT TO SHARE THIS TYPE OF

01:53:49.356 --> 01:53:52.025 region:rollup2
INFORMATION WITH WITH STATE AND

01:53:50.991 --> 01:53:53.126 region:rollup2
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TRIBAL TECH

01:53:52.025 --> 01:53:54.961 region:rollup2
AND TRIBAL AND TERRITORIAL

01:53:53.126 --> 01:53:56.296 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENTS AS WELL AND SO

01:53:54.961 --> 01:53:58.465 region:rollup2
UTILIZING THE RESOURCES AT THE

IMAX ISAC AS WELL AS. DHS IS

01:53:58.465 --> 01:54:01.334 region:rollup2
CAPABILITIES PUSH IT ALL THE WAY

01:53:59.900 --> 01:54:02.903 region:rollup2
OUT SIR STEP NUMBER ONE I WAS

01:54:01.334 --> 01:54:03.970 region:rollup2
GETTING ALL THE LOCALS IN IN

01:54:02.903 --> 01:54:06.306 region:rollup2
WHATEVER WAY THE STATE WANTS TO

01:54:03.970 --> 01:54:06.673 region:rollup2
GAUGE IT SIGNED UP FOR THEM AS I

01:54:06.306 --> 01:54:08.775 region:rollup2
SAT TO RECEIVE.

PA THE ELECTIONS INFORMATION.

01:54:08.775 --> 01:54:11.078 region:rollup2

LIKE A COLORADO.

01:54:11.078 --> 01:54:13.880 region:rollup2
WHICH OF TOLD LOCAL ELECTION

MUST REPORT IT TO THE STATES SO

01:54:19.286 --> 01:54:21.555 region:rollup2
EACH STATE KIND OF FIGURING OUT

01:54:20.487 --> 01:54:23.690 region:rollup2
HOW THEY WANT TO HANDLE THAT.

01:54:21.555 --> 01:54:24.858 region:rollup2
AND WHAT LEVERAGE THEY HAVE ON

01:55:36.430 --> 01:55:39.432 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT PROBLEM. BUT I'M JUST

01:55:38.331 --> 01:55:40.734 region:rollup2
CURIOUS TO SEE IF HE HAD THE

01:55:39.432 --> 01:55:42.335 region:rollup2
POINT OF VIEW IN THAT YET SO I

01:55:40.734 --> 01:55:44.871 region:rollup2
THINK WELL ONE.

01:55:42.335 --> 01:55:45.405 region:rollup2
IN ONE A PARTICULAR AREA IT WAS

01:55:44.871 --> 01:55:46.907 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY.

01:55:45.405 --> 01:55:48.408 region:rollup2
IMPACTFUL THAT IS PROVIDING

01:55:46.907 --> 01:55:49.443 region:rollup2
FULL ACCESSIBILITY TO TO VOTERS

01:55:48.408 --> 01:55:51.044 region:rollup2
WITH DISABILITIES IN

01:55:49.443 --> 01:55:52.846 region:rollup2
AND NEEDS TO I MEAN THAT WAS AT

01:55:51.044 --> 01:55:54.648 region:rollup2
THE CORE OF WHAT HAVA. I DID IN

01:55:52.846 --> 01:55:56.082 region:rollup2
WELL IN PART OF THE REASON WHY I

01:55:54.648 --> 01:55:56.716 region:rollup2
THAT CHANGE WAS SUCCESSFUL BUT

01:55:56.082 --> 01:55:58.585 region:rollup2
THERE WERE THERE WERE MUCH UP.

01:55:56.716 --> 01:55:59.653 region:rollup2
MANY OTHER SUBTLE I

01:55:58.585 --> 01:56:00.987 region:rollup2
IMPROVEMENTS THAT I THINK OVER

01:55:59.653 --> 01:56:02.622 region:rollup2
TIME HAVE BEEN CRITICALLY

01:56:00.987 --> 01:56:03.423 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT ELECTIONS AND ONE THAT

01:56:02.622 --> 01:56:04.825 region:rollup2
I HIGHLIGHT.

01:56:03.423 --> 01:56:06.860 region:rollup2
THAT CALIFORNIA ACTUALLY IT'S

01:56:04.825 --> 01:56:08.862 region:rollup2
BEEN VARIABLE THEN IS UP ONE OF

01:56:06.860 --> 01:56:10.564 region:rollup2
THE PROBLEMS OF FROM FLORIDA TWO

01:56:08.862 --> 01:56:12.666 region:rollup2
THOUSAND THAT NOW THE NATION.

01:56:10.564 --> 01:56:13.033 region:rollup2
HAS WORKED TO ADDRESS OVER TIME

01:56:12.666 --> 01:56:14.801 region:rollup2
IS.

01:56:13.033 --> 01:56:16.770 region:rollup2
THE USABILITY OF THE BALLOTS IN

01:56:14.801 --> 01:56:18.171 region:rollup2
THE SYSTEM SO THAT VOTERS ARE

01:56:16.770 --> 01:56:19.806 region:rollup2
ABLE TO UNDERSTANDING CAST THEIR

01:56:18.171 --> 01:56:21.842 region:rollup2
VOTE ALLY AS THEY INTENDED AND

01:56:19.806 --> 01:56:23.877 region:rollup2
THERE'S BEEN A TON OF WORK. DONE

01:56:21.842 --> 01:56:24.744 region:rollup2
TO IMPROVE NOT JUST THE SYSTEMS

01:56:23.877 --> 01:56:25.479 region:rollup2
BUT THE ACTUAL BALLOT DESIGN AND

01:56:24.744 --> 01:56:27.514 region:rollup2
LAYOUT.

01:56:25.479 --> 01:56:28.248 region:rollup2
SO THAT VOTERS UNDERSTAND WHAT

01:56:27.514 --> 01:56:29.182 region:rollup2
THEY'RE VOTING ON.

01:56:28.248 --> 01:56:30.884 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND.

01:56:29.182 --> 01:56:31.184 region:rollup2
HOW HOW TO CAST THEIR BALLOT IN

01:56:30.884 --> 01:56:32.586 region:rollup2
THAT IT'S?

01:56:31.184 --> 01:56:34.621 region:rollup2
IT COUNTED APPROPRIATELY GIVE

01:56:32.586 --> 01:56:36.089 region:rollup2
ANY MEASURABLE OUTCOMES THERE

01:56:34.621 --> 01:56:38.425 region:rollup2
THAT YOU THINK IS WIDE ELECTION

01:56:36.089 --> 01:56:39.025 region:rollup2
THE COMMITTEES OF ONE OF THE

01:56:38.425 --> 01:56:40.427 region:rollup2
COMMITTEES I REPRESENT WHERE.

01:56:39.025 --> 01:56:41.328 region:rollup2
CLEAR THERE WAS GREAT CONFUSION

01:56:40.427 --> 01:56:42.896 region:rollup2
ABOUT HOW THE BALLOT WAS WOULD

01:56:41.328 --> 01:56:43.897 region:rollup2
LIKE WE SAW IN FLORIDA AND THE

01:56:42.896 --> 01:56:45.365 region:rollup2
LIKE IT'S STILL HAPPEN IN TWO

01:56:43.897 --> 01:56:47.734 region:rollup2
THOUSAND AND.

01:56:45.365 --> 01:56:49.469 region:rollup2
FOURTEEN YET SO THERE'S. A

01:56:47.734 --> 01:56:51.371 region:rollup2
WEALTH OF RESEARCH ACTUALLY NOW

01:56:49.469 --> 01:56:52.873 region:rollup2
ON BOTH THE IMPROVEMENTS THAT

01:56:51.371 --> 01:56:54.574 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN MADE A I CAN'T BE MADE

01:56:52.873 --> 01:56:55.609 region:rollup2
ON BALLOT DESIGN ABOUT LAYOUT

01:56:54.574 --> 01:56:56.109 region:rollup2
EVEN JUST VOTER INFORMATION OF

01:56:55.609 --> 01:56:58.411 region:rollup2
THE A. C..

01:56:56.109 --> 01:56:59.246 region:rollup2
.

01:56:58.411 --> 01:57:02.315 region:rollup2
PROVIDED A GRANT.

01:56:59.246 --> 01:57:04.484 region:rollup2
TO DESIGNING OUR DEMOCRACY

01:57:02.315 --> 01:57:05.852 region:rollup2
GRANT ARE ON THIS AND THAT IT

01:57:04.484 --> 01:57:07.320 region:rollup2
WAS BUILT UP OFF OF THAT WITH AN

01:57:05.852 --> 01:57:09.022 region:rollup2
ONGOING PROJECT BY THE CENTER

01:57:07.320 --> 01:57:11.124 region:rollup2
FOR CIVIC DESIGN. OUR DO IT%

01:57:09.022 --> 01:57:13.560 region:rollup2
LOOKING UP LOOKING AT THIS

01:57:11.124 --> 01:57:14.928 region:rollup2
EXACTLY THIS EXACT ISSUE SO THAT

01:57:13.560 --> 01:57:15.896 region:rollup2
THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN OUGHT TO

01:57:14.928 --> 01:57:17.731 region:rollup2

LAST.

01:57:18.532 --> 01:57:23.036 region:rollup2
PRACTICE.

01:57:20.100 --> 01:57:23.670 region:rollup2
THE OPEN PRIMARY STATES.

01:57:23.036 --> 01:57:25.238 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW HAVE YOU SEEN THAT WE

01:57:23.670 --> 01:57:26.439 region:rollup2
SHOULD HAVE CONFUSION THERE WERE

01:57:25.238 --> 01:57:27.774 region:rollup2
SOMEONE DON'T DON'T RULE DON'T

01:57:26.439 --> 01:57:29.876 region:rollup2

01:57:27.774 --> 01:57:31.144 region:rollup2
NATURE OF OPEN PRIMARIES. SO OF

01:57:29.876 --> 01:57:33.380 region:rollup2
THEIR PERFECT PART PARTY

01:57:31.144 --> 01:57:34.047 region:rollup2
PREFERENCE TO PICK THE FIRST ONE

01:57:33.380 --> 01:57:35.582 region:rollup2
IN THE BECAUSE SOME CHALLENGE IF

GUIDANCE I KNOW THIS IS A

01:57:39.119 --> 01:57:41.755 region:rollup2
CHALLENGE AND IN IN SEVERAL

01:57:40.820 --> 01:57:42.756 region:rollup2
STATES WITH OPEN PRIMARY SORTA

01:57:41.755 --> 01:57:44.190 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY AS MORE STATES ARE

01:57:42.756 --> 01:57:45.659 region:rollup2
MOVING TO VOTE BY MAIL AND HOW

A REALLY GOOD ONE. IS THERE A

01:57:51.665 --> 01:57:54.568 region:rollup2
LOT OF LESSONS LEARNED ABOUT

01:57:54.100 --> 01:57:56.236 region:rollup2
PURCHASING

01:57:54.568 --> 01:57:58.171 region:rollup2
ARE AND HOW TO PURCHASE SYSTEMS

01:57:56.236 --> 01:57:59.773 region:rollup2
OF WHEN HARPER WAS PASSED AT THE

01:58:03.710 --> 01:58:05.679 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS

01:58:04.277 --> 01:58:07.547 region:rollup2
I AM ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE

THAT THEY FACE WITH THE SYSTEMS

01:58:22.228 --> 01:58:25.699 region:rollup2
ARE AND ARE MUCH CLEARER ON HOW

01:58:24.831 --> 01:58:27.133 region:rollup2

02:05:53.446 --> 02:05:55.548 region:rollup2
SMALLEST ELECTION OFFICES.

02:05:54.013 --> 02:05:58.284 region:rollup2
AND MANY OF THESE RESOURCES ARE

02:05:55.548 --> 02:05:58.851 region:rollup2
FREE OF CHARGE SOME SOME THERE

02:05:58.284 --> 02:06:00.086 region:rollup2
ARE CHARGES BUT MANY OF THEM

02:05:58.851 --> 02:06:01.554 region:rollup2
FREE.

02:06:00.086 --> 02:06:03.056 region:rollup2
FOR INSTANCE IN CONJUNCTION WITH

02:06:01.554 --> 02:06:04.690 region:rollup2
DHS ELECTION OFFICES CAN

02:06:03.056 --> 02:06:05.491 region:rollup2
REGULARLY MONITOR ELECTION

02:06:04.690 --> 02:06:07.427 region:rollup2
SYSTEM THREATS AND

02:06:05.491 --> 02:06:09.562 region:rollup2
VULNERABILITIES TO DEFEND ANY

02:06:07.427 --> 02:06:11.731 region:rollup2
CYBER RELATED NETWORK ATTACKS.

02:06:09.562 --> 02:06:13.466 region:rollup2
INCLUDING PHISHING SCAMS MALWARE

02:06:11.731 --> 02:06:15.001 region:rollup2
DENIAL OF SERVICE ATTACKS AND

02:06:13.466 --> 02:06:17.937 region:rollup2
OTHER COMMON PRACTICES EMPLOYED

02:06:15.001 --> 02:06:19.639 region:rollup2
BY MALICIOUS ACTORS.

02:06:17.937 --> 02:06:21.574 region:rollup2
IN ADDITION PARTING WITH DHS AN

02:06:19.639 --> 02:06:23.209 region:rollup2
IN HOUSE IT ADVISORS PRIVATE

02:06:21.574 --> 02:06:24.944 region:rollup2
SECURITY PARTNERS STATE AND

02:06:23.209 --> 02:06:25.945 region:rollup2
LOCAL SAYS THOSE AND OTHERS WILL

02:06:24.944 --> 02:06:27.780 region:rollup2
HELP TO ENSURE THAT ELECTION

02:06:25.945 --> 02:06:28.614 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS ARE SECURE WITH

02:06:27.780 --> 02:06:31.017 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGIES AND STANDARD

02:06:28.614 --> 02:06:32.518 region:rollup2
OPERATING PRACTICES.

02:06:31.017 --> 02:06:34.420 region:rollup2
SO ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT I

02:06:32.518 --> 02:06:36.589 region:rollup2
GOT UP EARLY ON WHEN WHEN I WAS

02:06:34.420 --> 02:06:37.457 region:rollup2
INVITED TO SPEAK WAS YOU KNOW

02:06:36.589 --> 02:06:38.724 region:rollup2
THERE A FEW COUNTIES IN

02:06:37.457 --> 02:06:40.126 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA THAT ARE STILL USING

02:06:38.724 --> 02:06:41.594 region:rollup2
ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS ORANGE COUNTY

02:06:40.126 --> 02:06:43.162 region:rollup2
BEING ONE OF THEM.

02:06:41.594 --> 02:06:45.064 region:rollup2
NUMBER FORTUNE IN CALIFORNIA

02:06:43.162 --> 02:06:46.532 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE THE REQUIREMENT OF

02:06:45.064 --> 02:06:48.768 region:rollup2
HAVING A PAPER BACK UP ON THOSE

02:06:46.532 --> 02:06:50.403 region:rollup2
ELECTRONIC BOOTHS.

02:06:48.768 --> 02:06:52.505 region:rollup2
THESE VOTER VERIFIED PAPER LA

02:06:50.403 --> 02:06:54.440 region:rollup2
BALLOTS PROVIDE EVIDENCE OF EACH

02:06:52.505 --> 02:06:55.608 region:rollup2
VOTERS INTENT IN A WAY THAT

02:06:54.440 --> 02:06:57.777 region:rollup2
CANNOT BE COMPROMISED BY

02:06:55.608 --> 02:06:58.778 region:rollup2
COMPUTER ELEMENTS OF THE VOTING

02:06:57.777 --> 02:07:00.480 region:rollup2
SYSTEM THAT'S CRITICAL.

02:06:58.778 --> 02:07:02.014 region:rollup2
IN ADDITION AIR GAPS PROTECT

02:07:00.480 --> 02:07:03.649 region:rollup2
AGAINST NETWORK INTRUSIONS AND

02:07:02.014 --> 02:07:05.585 region:rollup2
STRICT STEALIN CHAIN OF CUSTODY

02:07:03.649 --> 02:07:06.619 region:rollup2
MEASURES ARE IN PLACE.

02:07:05.585 --> 02:07:07.887 region:rollup2
NOW THERE ARE MANY BRILLIANT

02:07:06.619 --> 02:07:09.522 region:rollup2
MINDS AROUND THE COUNTRY THAT

02:07:07.887 --> 02:07:11.390 region:rollup2
WOULD PROBABLY HAVE A GOOD

02:07:09.522 --> 02:07:14.026 region:rollup2
DEBATE ON THIS ISSUE THAT SEALS

02:07:11.390 --> 02:07:14.861 region:rollup2
PROVIDE AID A LEVEL OF SECURITY

02:07:14.026 --> 02:07:16.762 region:rollup2
THAT IS.

02:07:14.861 --> 02:07:18.431 region:rollup2
AND NOT THE BEST.

02:07:16.762 --> 02:07:19.298 region:rollup2
ARE HOWEVER I FEEL IT THESE

02:07:18.431 --> 02:07:20.867 region:rollup2
PROTECTIONS THAT ARE IN PLACE

02:07:19.298 --> 02:07:23.436 region:rollup2
ARE STRONG BARRIERS.

02:07:20.867 --> 02:07:24.770 region:rollup2
AND AND THEY'RE VERY IMPORTANT.

02:07:23.436 --> 02:07:26.105 region:rollup2
SO IN MY OPINION THAT'S NOT

02:07:24.770 --> 02:07:27.006 region:rollup2
ENOUGH AND I WANT TO GET INTO A

02:07:26.105 --> 02:07:28.474 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT OF THE MEAT POTATOES

02:07:27.006 --> 02:07:30.076 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE THINGS I THINK WE

02:07:28.474 --> 02:07:31.978 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE DOING TODAY.

02:07:30.076 --> 02:07:34.380 region:rollup2
WE MUST CONSIDER MY OPINION

02:07:31.978 --> 02:07:35.748 region:rollup2
MOVING TOWARDS A ROBUST SYSTEM

02:07:34.380 --> 02:07:36.816 region:rollup2
OF RISK LIMITING AUDITS.

02:07:35.748 --> 02:07:38.584 region:rollup2
PURPOSE OF A SOUND ELECTION

02:07:36.816 --> 02:07:39.085 region:rollup2
AUDIT IS TO PROVIDE CONFIDENCE

02:07:38.584 --> 02:07:41.020 region:rollup2
THAT ELECTION OUTCOME IS

02:07:39.085 --> 02:07:42.555 region:rollup2
CORRECT.

02:07:41.020 --> 02:07:44.390 region:rollup2
ANY POTENTIAL ERRORS AND

02:07:42.555 --> 02:07:46.259 region:rollup2
TABULATION MUST BE DETECTED AND

02:07:44.390 --> 02:07:47.293 region:rollup2
CORRECTED.

02:07:46.259 --> 02:07:48.861 region:rollup2
RISK LIMITING AUDITS CAN BE

02:07:47.293 --> 02:07:50.363 region:rollup2
INCREDIBLY EFFICIENT.

02:07:48.861 --> 02:07:52.331 region:rollup2
AN ELECTION WITH TENS OF

02:07:50.363 --> 02:07:53.432 region:rollup2
MILLIONS OF BALLOTS CAN.

02:07:52.331 --> 02:07:55.134 region:rollup2
ATTENTION WOULD BE CHECKED BY

02:07:53.432 --> 02:07:57.403 region:rollup2
EXAMINING ONLY A FEW HUNDRED

02:07:55.134 --> 02:07:58.404 region:rollup2
RANDOMLY SELECTED BALLOTS.

02:07:57.403 --> 02:07:59.939 region:rollup2
I PLAN ON CONDUCTING ONE OF

02:07:58.404 --> 02:08:02.041 region:rollup2
THESE RISK WINNING AUDITS IN

02:07:59.939 --> 02:08:04.844 region:rollup2
JUNE AS A PILOT PROGRAM. ON THE

02:08:02.041 --> 02:08:06.579 region:rollup2
PURPOSE OF THAT IS TO SHOWCASE A

02:08:04.844 --> 02:08:08.781 region:rollup2
PROOF OF CONCEPT THAT YOU CAN'T

02:08:06.579 --> 02:08:10.049 region:rollup2
ON LEGACY SYSTEMS CONDUCTORAS

02:08:08.781 --> 02:08:12.051 region:rollup2
LOOMING ON IT AND I THINK THAT'S

02:08:10.049 --> 02:08:13.152 region:rollup2
CRITICAL.

02:08:12.051 --> 02:08:14.654 region:rollup2
THERE'S A LOT OF FOCUS ON VOTING

02:08:13.152 --> 02:08:16.522 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS COMMISSIONER MATCHES AND

02:08:14.654 --> 02:08:17.757 region:rollup2
TALKED ABOUT THIS DELINEATION

02:08:16.522 --> 02:08:19.692 region:rollup2
BETWEEN VOTING SYSTEMS AND VOTER

02:08:17.757 --> 02:08:20.993 region:rollup2
REGISTRATION SYSTEM.

02:08:19.692 --> 02:08:22.328 region:rollup2
BUT IN MY OPINION THE REALITIES

02:08:20.993 --> 02:08:22.962 region:rollup2
IS GREATER VULNERABILITIES THAT

02:08:22.328 --> 02:08:25.398 region:rollup2
ARE OUT THERE.

02:08:22.962 --> 02:08:27.333 region:rollup2
OUTSIDE OF THE VOTING SYSTEM.

02:08:25.398 --> 02:08:28.935 region:rollup2
SO FOR INSTANCE WE KNOW THAT IT

02:08:27.333 --> 02:08:31.137 region:rollup2
VOTER REGISTRATIONS.

02:08:28.935 --> 02:08:33.439 region:rollup2
WAS SUCCESSFULLY INTRUDED UPON

02:08:31.137 --> 02:08:34.574 region:rollup2
IN ILLINOIS WERE SEVENTY SEVEN

02:08:33.439 --> 02:08:36.409 region:rollup2
THOUSAND VOTER RECORDS.

02:08:34.574 --> 02:08:37.944 region:rollup2
WERE AT STAKE.

02:08:36.409 --> 02:08:39.078 region:rollup2
IN ORANGE COUNTY THERE ARE ON

02:08:37.944 --> 02:08:40.246 region:rollup2
AVERAGE I WANNA GIVE A PRACTICAL

02:08:39.078 --> 02:08:41.514 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE TO

02:08:40.246 --> 02:08:43.049 region:rollup2
S. RATES WE HAVE ELEVEN HUNDRED

02:08:41.514 --> 02:08:44.984 region:rollup2
DEATHS THAT OCCUR EACH MONTH IN

02:08:43.049 --> 02:08:46.319 region:rollup2
ORANGE COUNTY.

02:08:44.984 --> 02:08:47.520 region:rollup2
AND I WOULD WANT TO BE ABLE TO

02:08:46.319 --> 02:08:49.255 region:rollup2
DETECT WITHIN MY VOTER

02:08:47.520 --> 02:08:50.790 region:rollup2
REGISTRATION DATABASE ANY

02:08:49.255 --> 02:08:51.724 region:rollup2
ANOMALIES IN THAT DATA MY SING

02:08:50.790 --> 02:08:53.025 region:rollup2
ANY TRENDS THAT MIGHT BE

02:08:51.724 --> 02:08:55.027 region:rollup2
OCCURRING THAT'S ACTUALLY PRETTY

02:08:53.025 --> 02:08:56.929 region:rollup2
SIMPLE TO DO.

02:08:55.027 --> 02:08:59.298 region:rollup2
BUT WHAT ABOUT PARTY CHANGES.

02:08:56.929 --> 02:09:00.199 region:rollup2
WHAT A PARTY CHANGES WERE DONE

02:08:59.298 --> 02:09:01.500 region:rollup2
IN A SUBTLE WAY THAT THAT WERE

02:09:00.199 --> 02:09:03.102 region:rollup2
IMPERCEPTIBLE THAT YOU COULD NOT

02:09:01.500 --> 02:09:05.004 region:rollup2
DETECT THEM?

02:09:03.102 --> 02:09:06.005 region:rollup2
HAVING THE ABILITY TO DETECT

02:09:05.004 --> 02:09:07.440 region:rollup2
NUANCES IN THE DATA WOULD BE

02:09:06.005 --> 02:09:09.041 region:rollup2
INVALUABLE.

02:09:07.440 --> 02:09:11.143 region:rollup2
CAPTURING SNAPSHOTS OF THAT

02:09:09.041 --> 02:09:12.778 region:rollup2
DATABASE IN CONDUCTING AUDITS ON

02:09:11.143 --> 02:09:14.347 region:rollup2
THE VOTER REGISTRATION SYSTEM I

02:09:12.778 --> 02:09:15.147 region:rollup2
THINK IS JUST AS IMPORTANT AS

02:09:14.347 --> 02:09:16.782 region:rollup2
CONDUCTING AUDITS ON THE VOTING

02:09:15.147 --> 02:09:19.352 region:rollup2
SYSTEM.

02:09:16.782 --> 02:09:20.453 region:rollup2
OUR A AND IT'S CRITICAL.

02:09:19.352 --> 02:09:21.621 region:rollup2
FINALLY I WANT TO TALK ABOUT

02:09:20.453 --> 02:09:23.055 region:rollup2
FUNDING ISSUES I THINK IT'S

02:09:21.621 --> 02:09:24.457 region:rollup2
IMPERATIVE THAT ELECTION OFFICES

02:09:23.055 --> 02:09:26.359 region:rollup2
HAVE SUFFICIENT EQUIPMENT

02:09:24.457 --> 02:09:27.760 region:rollup2
TECHNICAL SUPPORT AND RESOURCES

02:09:26.359 --> 02:09:29.562 region:rollup2
TO MAINTAIN A SOUND SECURITY

02:09:27.760 --> 02:09:30.730 region:rollup2
POSTURE FOR THEIR ELECTION BASED

02:09:29.562 --> 02:09:32.565 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS.

02:09:30.730 --> 02:09:34.367 region:rollup2
INCLUDING REPLACING AGING VOTING

02:09:32.565 --> 02:09:35.601 region:rollup2
EQUIPMENT THAT IS NEARING AND OF

02:09:34.367 --> 02:09:37.470 region:rollup2
LIFE I'M ONE OF THOSE CITIES

02:09:35.601 --> 02:09:39.171 region:rollup2
USING WINDOWS TWO THOUSAND ON A

02:09:37.470 --> 02:09:40.906 region:rollup2
PORTION OF THE SYSTEM AND LOVE

02:09:39.171 --> 02:09:42.675 region:rollup2
TO ENGAGE ON THAT DISCUSSION.

02:09:40.906 --> 02:09:44.243 region:rollup2
THERE'S A NUMBER OF REASONS FOR

02:09:42.675 --> 02:09:46.145 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:09:44.243 --> 02:09:47.280 region:rollup2
BUT NO LONGER MEET STATE

02:09:46.145 --> 02:09:48.648 region:rollup2
TESTING AND CERTIFICATION

02:09:47.280 --> 02:09:50.049 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS AND SOME OF THE

02:09:48.648 --> 02:09:51.450 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS AND THEY WILL SOON FAIL

02:09:50.049 --> 02:09:52.518 region:rollup2
TO MEET SUCH REQUIREMENTS DUE TO

02:09:51.450 --> 02:09:54.487 region:rollup2
A LACK OF TECHNICAL SUPPORT AND

02:09:52.518 --> 02:09:55.788 region:rollup2
REPLACEMENT PARTS.

02:09:54.487 --> 02:09:56.956 region:rollup2
I'M GRATEFUL TO THE SECRETARY OF

02:09:55.788 --> 02:09:57.857 region:rollup2

02:09:56.956 --> 02:09:59.225 region:rollup2
INCLUDING FUNDING IN THE

02:09:57.857 --> 02:10:00.259 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET

02:09:59.225 --> 02:10:01.961 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL FOR THE REPLACEMENT OF

02:10:01.961 --> 02:10:05.331 region:rollup2
BUT I KNOW IT'S NOT LOST ON THIS

02:10:03.529 --> 02:10:06.966 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE I JUST WANT TO TO PUT

02:10:05.331 --> 02:10:08.601 region:rollup2

02:10:06.966 --> 02:10:09.969 region:rollup2
STILL NOT APPROPRIATE THE FULL

THREE HUNDRED NINETY SIX MILLION

02:10:09.969 --> 02:10:12.738 region:rollup2
DOLLARS LEFT IN HAVA.

02:10:11.437 --> 02:10:14.373 region:rollup2
THAT NEEDS TO BE APPROPRIATED

02:10:12.738 --> 02:10:15.007 region:rollup2

THERE WERE NOTES THAT THERE'S NO

02:11:12.898 --> 02:11:16.068 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC INFORMATION TO

COMPROMISED.

02:11:17.036 --> 02:11:19.772 region:rollup2
OR THAT THE VOTE TABULATION

HOWEVER WITHOUT QUESTION OUR

02:11:22.775 --> 02:11:26.078 region:rollup2
AWARENESS AND ALERTNESS IS

02:11:24.343 --> 02:11:26.612 region:rollup2
HEIGHTENED BASED ON THE

02:11:26.078 --> 02:11:27.413 region:rollup2
RECOGNIZABLE ACTIVITY AND

02:11:26.612 --> 02:11:28.414 region:rollup2
THREATS.

02:11:27.413 --> 02:11:29.815 region:rollup2

02:11:31.317 --> 02:11:34.120 region:rollup2
WHAT IS CLEAR IS THAT THERE ARE

02:11:32.451 --> 02:11:35.521 region:rollup2
BAD ACTORS ACTIVELY TRYING TO

02:11:34.120 --> 02:11:37.356 region:rollup2
DISRUPT THE ELECTIONS PROCESS

02:11:35.521 --> 02:11:38.858 region:rollup2
AND THAT THREAT IS COMPOUNDED BY

02:11:37.356 --> 02:11:40.626 region:rollup2
INCONSISTENT INFORMATION SHARING

02:11:38.858 --> 02:11:41.894 region:rollup2

PREPAREDNESS FOR ELECTIONS THERE

02:11:55.975 --> 02:12:00.479 region:rollup2
ARE TWO IMPORTANT POINTS ODD TO

REMEMBER FIRST CYBERSECURITY IS

02:12:00.479 --> 02:12:03.349 region:rollup2
NO DIFFERENT FOR ELECTIONS THAN

02:12:01.814 --> 02:12:04.617 region:rollup2
IT IS FOR OTHER CRITICAL SECTORS

02:12:03.349 --> 02:12:05.618 region:rollup2
INVOLVING THINGS LIKE HEALTHCARE

02:12:04.617 --> 02:12:07.119 region:rollup2

02:12:07.119 --> 02:12:10.089 region:rollup2
THE BEST CYBERSECURITY PRACTICES

02:12:08.721 --> 02:12:12.191 region:rollup2

02:12:18.931 --> 02:12:22.368 region:rollup2
ELECTION SECURITY.

02:12:20.900 --> 02:12:23.736 region:rollup2
SECOND CYBERSECURITY INVOLVE

02:12:41.454 --> 02:12:44.123 region:rollup2
WE REMAIN CONFIDENT THAT OUR

02:12:42.755 --> 02:12:45.925 region:rollup2

02:12:44.123 --> 02:12:47.593 region:rollup2
LIMITED AGILITY IN COMBINATION

SOME VULNERABILITIES AND WE

02:19:55.487 --> 02:19:57.923 region:rollup2
DOUBLE CHECK EVERYTHING TRIPLE

02:19:56.788 --> 02:19:58.490 region:rollup2

AND YOU KNOW AND ALL EVIDENCE

02:20:02.327 --> 02:20:04.229 region:rollup2
THAT'S BEEN GATHERED BY THE

02:20:03.228 --> 02:20:05.731 region:rollup2
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITIES HAVE

02:20:04.229 --> 02:20:07.366 region:rollup2
CONFIRMED THAT WE ARE MAINLY

02:20:05.731 --> 02:20:08.900 region:rollup2
DEALING WITH TROLLS. WHO ARE

02:20:07.366 --> 02:20:10.102 region:rollup2
SCANNING OUR SYSTEM BASICALLY

02:20:08.900 --> 02:20:12.070 region:rollup2
KNOCKING ON THOSE DOORS

02:20:10.102 --> 02:20:14.406 region:rollup2
PRIMARILY VOTER REGISTRATION SO

02:20:12.070 --> 02:20:15.974 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT THAT HOW WE'RE?

02:20:14.406 --> 02:20:17.075 region:rollup2
PRESENTING THIS IN THE MEDIA'S

02:20:15.974 --> 02:20:18.110 region:rollup2
VERY VERY IMPORTANT.

02:20:17.075 --> 02:20:19.511 region:rollup2
AND THE EFFORTS IN TWENTY

02:20:18.110 --> 02:20:20.946 region:rollup2
SIXTEEN WHERE THERE ARE TWENTY

02:20:19.511 --> 02:20:22.447 region:rollup2
ONE STATES ARE SCANNED BY

02:20:20.946 --> 02:20:24.116 region:rollup2
RUSSIAN IP ADDRESSES THERE WAS

02:20:22.447 --> 02:20:25.450 region:rollup2
ONLY THAT ONE INSTANCE IN EL

02:20:24.116 --> 02:20:27.419 region:rollup2
ILLINOIS WHERE THEY ACTUALLY

02:20:25.450 --> 02:20:29.421 region:rollup2
ACCESS THE VOTER DATA NO RECORDS

02:20:27.419 --> 02:20:30.322 region:rollup2
WERE ALTERED OR DELETED. AND THE

02:20:29.421 --> 02:20:32.224 region:rollup2
BOTTOM LINE IS THAT OUR

02:20:30.322 --> 02:20:33.258 region:rollup2
FIREWALLS HAVE PREVAILED AND

02:20:32.224 --> 02:20:33.425 region:rollup2
THEY DID NOT GET IN.

02:20:33.258 --> 02:20:34.993 region:rollup2
AND.

02:20:33.425 --> 02:20:38.397 region:rollup2
.

02:20:34.993 --> 02:20:40.098 region:rollup2
I THINK THERE GOAL THOUGH IS TO.

02:20:38.397 --> 02:20:41.400 region:rollup2
BRING DOUBT INTO PEOPLE'S MINDS

02:20:40.098 --> 02:20:43.268 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE INTEGRITY AND THE

02:20:41.400 --> 02:20:44.236 region:rollup2
ACCURACY OF OUR VOTE AND IN THE

02:20:43.268 --> 02:20:45.604 region:rollup2
HOPES THAT WE STAY HOME AND

02:20:44.236 --> 02:20:47.472 region:rollup2
DON'T VOTE.

02:20:45.604 --> 02:20:49.308 region:rollup2
AND SO I REALLY AM TRYING TO GET

02:20:47.472 --> 02:20:51.343 region:rollup2
OUT THERE TO EDUCATE PEOPLE ON

02:20:49.308 --> 02:20:52.844 region:rollup2
THE IMPORTANCE OF GETTING SIGNED

02:20:51.343 --> 02:20:53.545 region:rollup2
UP. AND SHOWING UP ANDREW AND AT

02:20:52.844 --> 02:20:55.547 region:rollup2
THE POLLS.

02:20:53.545 --> 02:20:57.015 region:rollup2
AND.

02:20:55.547 --> 02:20:59.017 region:rollup2
SO WHERE THERE WAS A FAILURE TO

02:20:57.015 --> 02:21:01.019 region:rollup2
HALF THE VOTE I BELIEVE THERE

02:20:59.017 --> 02:21:02.788 region:rollup2
WAS A GREAT SUCCESS AND HACKING

02:21:01.019 --> 02:21:04.489 region:rollup2
IN PEOPLE'S MINDS AND BELIEFS.

02:21:02.788 --> 02:21:05.657 region:rollup2
AND I HAD THIS IS NOT NEW PEOPLE

APPLIANCES DEPLOYED THROUGHOUT

02:22:39.217 --> 02:22:42.687 region:rollup2
THE NETWORK WHICH BLOCK KNOWN

AND.

02:22:50.095 --> 02:22:53.598 region:rollup2
WE HAVE NO REMOTE ACCESS

02:22:51.563 --> 02:22:54.933 region:rollup2
SOFTWARE ON OUR SERVERS AS IF

02:22:53.598 --> 02:22:56.701 region:rollup2
THERE EVER IS AND KNOWN THREAT

02:22:54.933 --> 02:22:58.937 region:rollup2
TO ALEXIAN SYSTEMS IT IS

02:22:56.701 --> 02:23:00.372 region:rollup2
IMPERATIVE THAT THE STATE AND

02:22:58.937 --> 02:23:02.541 region:rollup2
LOCAL ELECTIONS OFFICIALS BE

02:23:00.372 --> 02:23:04.242 region:rollup2
NOTIFIED IMMEDIATELY. SO THAT WE

02:23:02.541 --> 02:23:05.744 region:rollup2
CAN FOR ANY EFFORT TO COMPROMISE

02:23:04.242 --> 02:23:07.779 region:rollup2
OUR SYSTEMS IT'S SO FRUSTRATING

02:23:05.744 --> 02:23:09.514 region:rollup2
GETTING THAT THE NEWS MONTHS OR

02:23:07.779 --> 02:23:10.582 region:rollup2
YEARS LATER. AND OF COURSE

02:23:09.514 --> 02:23:12.584 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA AND OF THE

INDEPENDENT FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES

02:23:14.886 --> 02:23:18.190 region:rollup2
SO I THINK IT'S MUCH MORE

02:23:16.455 --> 02:23:19.458 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT A HACK IN THE SYSTEMS.

02:23:18.190 --> 02:23:20.425 region:rollup2

STANDALONE VOTING EQUIPMENT THAT

FOR MORE FUNDING WE HAVE ONE OF

02:23:33.772 --> 02:23:36.274 region:rollup2
THOSE OLD SYSTEMS.

02:23:34.873 --> 02:23:38.376 region:rollup2
THAT WE DO NAY REPLACE BUT I

02:23:36.274 --> 02:23:40.812 region:rollup2

02:24:37.502 --> 02:24:40.972 region:rollup2
AMERICA IS UNDER ATTACK.

02:24:38.770 --> 02:24:42.741 region:rollup2
IT HAS BEEN UNDER ATTACK.

02:24:40.972 --> 02:24:44.175 region:rollup2
IT REMAINS UNDER ATTACK.

02:24:42.741 --> 02:24:46.111 region:rollup2

02:26:30.915 --> 02:26:32.784 region:rollup2
YOU CAN GO BACK TO SECRETARY

02:26:31.783 --> 02:26:34.152 region:rollup2
PREVIOUS POINT TO THEIR THERE IS

02:26:32.784 --> 02:26:36.321 region:rollup2
THERE'S A VOCABULARY AROUND OPEN

02:26:34.152 --> 02:26:37.656 region:rollup2
SOURCE TO IN AND A LOT A LOT OF

02:26:36.321 --> 02:26:38.923 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT DEFINITIONS THAT A LOT

02:26:37.656 --> 02:26:39.691 region:rollup2
OF DIFFERENT OPINIONS ON WHAT

02:26:38.923 --> 02:26:40.325 region:rollup2
TYPE OF LIFE AND THINK SHOULD BE

02:26:39.691 --> 02:26:42.494 region:rollup2
USED.

02:26:40.325 --> 02:26:43.395 region:rollup2
WHETHER WHETHER OPEN SOURCE

02:26:42.494 --> 02:26:45.063 region:rollup2
MEANS THAT YOU'RE PUBLISHING

02:26:43.395 --> 02:26:46.564 region:rollup2
THAT OUT ON GET HAVE BEEN MAKING

DOWNLOAD AND AND CONTRIBUTE TO

02:26:49.167 --> 02:26:53.405 region:rollup2
IT THERE THEIR DIFFERENT WAYS TO

02:26:50.568 --> 02:26:54.606 region:rollup2
DO THAT. ARE I THINK FROM FROM

02:26:53.405 --> 02:26:55.273 region:rollup2
OUR PERSPECTIVE JUST SPEAKING

02:26:54.606 --> 02:26:57.042 region:rollup2
FROM LOS ANGELES COUNTY'S

02:26:55.273 --> 02:27:00.378 region:rollup2
PROTECTIVE IN THE WORK THAT

02:26:57.042 --> 02:27:01.513 region:rollup2
WE'VE DONE ON MOVING FORWARD OUR

02:27:00.378 --> 02:27:03.415 region:rollup2
FUNDAMENTAL PREMISE IS THAT THAT

02:27:01.513 --> 02:27:04.182 region:rollup2
WE WANT TO HAVE. THE CORE.

02:27:03.415 --> 02:27:05.517 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT OF OUR VOTING

02:27:04.182 --> 02:27:07.152 region:rollup2
SYSTEM WE WANT THAT TO BE A

02:27:05.517 --> 02:27:09.020 region:rollup2
PUBLICLY ON SYSTEM WE BELIEVE

02:27:07.152 --> 02:27:10.455 region:rollup2
THAT THAT ELECTIONS ARE ARE

02:27:09.020 --> 02:27:13.692 region:rollup2
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO PUBLIC

02:27:10.455 --> 02:27:16.061 region:rollup2
THEY SHOULD NOT BE LIMITED TO

02:27:13.692 --> 02:27:17.328 region:rollup2
PROPRIETARY LIMITED SYSTEMS

02:27:16.061 --> 02:27:19.264 region:rollup2
WHERE WHERE WHERE THAT SOURCE

02:27:17.328 --> 02:27:21.666 region:rollup2
CODE CANNOT BE REVIEWED SO WE

02:27:19.264 --> 02:27:23.134 region:rollup2
HAVE WE HAVE PUT IN THE

02:27:21.666 --> 02:27:24.703 region:rollup2
PROVISIONS OF OUR F. P. THAT THE

02:27:23.134 --> 02:27:26.404 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT OF BASED ON THE

02:27:24.703 --> 02:27:28.773 region:rollup2
DESIGN SPECS THAT WE THAT WE ARE

02:27:26.404 --> 02:27:29.341 region:rollup2
ON THE IP FOR. THAT THAT BE

02:27:28.773 --> 02:27:31.142 region:rollup2
DEVELOPED ON AN OPEN SOURCE

02:27:29.341 --> 02:27:33.311 region:rollup2
PLATFORM HOW THAT GETS LICENSED

02:27:31.142 --> 02:27:34.012 region:rollup2
AND HOW THAT'S MADE AVAILABLE TO

02:27:33.311 --> 02:27:35.413 region:rollup2
BE SHARED WITH OTHER

02:27:34.012 --> 02:27:36.815 region:rollup2
JURISDICTIONS AND HOW THAT

02:27:35.413 --> 02:27:37.615 region:rollup2
SECURED. A IS STILL VERY

02:27:36.815 --> 02:27:39.718 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT.

02:27:37.615 --> 02:27:41.152 region:rollup2
TO DO SO I ALWAYS MAKE THE

02:27:39.718 --> 02:27:43.354 region:rollup2
DISTINCTION THAT.

02:27:41.152 --> 02:27:44.923 region:rollup2
WE ARE WE ARE OPERATING ON A

02:27:43.354 --> 02:27:45.990 region:rollup2
PROJECT THAT IS THEY'VE VOTING

02:27:44.923 --> 02:27:46.891 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS PROJECT.

02:27:45.990 --> 02:27:49.227 region:rollup2
NOT OPEN SOURCE

02:27:46.891 --> 02:27:50.562 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT.

02:27:49.227 --> 02:27:51.896 region:rollup2
IT SAID THAT THE NFL LITTLE BIT

02:27:50.562 --> 02:27:53.131 region:rollup2
OF ANYONE SO WHERE WERE USING

02:27:51.896 --> 02:27:55.033 region:rollup2
THE FUNDAMENTALS AND THE

02:27:53.131 --> 02:27:56.434 region:rollup2
STRENGTH OF OPEN SOURCE BUT IT

02:27:55.033 --> 02:27:57.936 region:rollup2
IS NOT A DEMONSTRATION OF OPEN

02:27:56.434 --> 02:27:59.070 region:rollup2
SOURCE AT THE DEMONSTRATION ON.

02:27:57.936 --> 02:27:59.971 region:rollup2
HOW TO GET THE BEST VOTING

02:27:59.070 --> 02:28:01.906 region:rollup2
SYSTEM THAT WILL MEET THE NEEDS

02:27:59.971 --> 02:28:03.408 region:rollup2
OF OUR VOTERS SO IT'S FOR VOTERS

02:28:01.906 --> 02:28:05.043 region:rollup2
FIRST AND THEN WE WILL?

02:28:03.408 --> 02:28:07.112 region:rollup2
WE WILL EXTEND THE THE OPEN

02:28:05.043 --> 02:28:08.747 region:rollup2
SOURCE PLATFORM BEYOND THAT SO

02:28:07.112 --> 02:28:09.247 region:rollup2
BUT ALL OF THAT SAID I THINK

02:28:08.747 --> 02:28:11.349 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:28:09.247 --> 02:28:12.650 region:rollup2
I I CAN TELL YOU FROM THE WORK

02:28:11.349 --> 02:28:14.018 region:rollup2
THAT WE'VE DONE THAT FOR

02:28:12.650 --> 02:28:15.487 region:rollup2
INSTANCE THAT OUR TALLY SYSTEM

02:28:14.018 --> 02:28:17.789 region:rollup2
THAT THAT WE PLAN TO HAVE

02:28:15.487 --> 02:28:18.289 region:rollup2
CERTIFIED AND AN OPERATING FOR

02:28:17.789 --> 02:28:19.691 region:rollup2
VOTE BY MAIL BALLOTS IN

02:28:18.289 --> 02:28:22.060 region:rollup2
NOVEMBER.

02:28:19.691 --> 02:28:23.128 region:rollup2
A HAS BEEN DEVELOPED AND IS

02:28:22.060 --> 02:28:24.162 region:rollup2
BEING DEVELOPED ON AN OPEN

02:28:23.128 --> 02:28:25.430 region:rollup2
SOURCE PLATFORM AND THE USER

02:28:24.162 --> 02:28:27.465 region:rollup2
INTERFACE FOR ABOUT MARKING

02:28:25.430 --> 02:28:28.266 region:rollup2
DEVICES THAT WILL. BE OPERATING

02:28:27.465 --> 02:28:29.901 region:rollup2
AT ABOUT SENATORS AND TWENTY

02:28:28.266 --> 02:28:31.436 region:rollup2
TWENTY.

02:28:29.901 --> 02:28:32.637 region:rollup2
ALSO IS REQUIRED TO BE

02:28:31.436 --> 02:28:35.373 region:rollup2
DEVELOPED ON AN OPEN SOURCE

02:28:32.637 --> 02:28:37.375 region:rollup2
PLATFORM A AND I THINK THAT

02:28:35.373 --> 02:28:39.677 region:rollup2
ADDRESSES SOME OF THE ISSUES

02:28:37.375 --> 02:28:40.278 region:rollup2
THAT CENTER LEYVA.

02:28:39.677 --> 02:28:40.945 region:rollup2
REFERENCE IN A QUESTION TO

02:28:40.278 --> 02:28:42.947 region:rollup2
SECRETARY VIDEO EARLIER IS THAT

02:28:40.945 --> 02:28:46.151 region:rollup2
THAT WE DO HAVE DISPARITY IN

02:28:42.947 --> 02:28:49.020 region:rollup2
TERMS OF RESOURCES AND OPTIONS

02:28:46.151 --> 02:28:51.256 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE TO COUNTIES BASED ON

02:28:49.020 --> 02:28:56.761 region:rollup2
SIZE AND RESOURCES AND LA COUNTY

02:28:51.256 --> 02:28:59.798 region:rollup2
WHEN WE. UNDERTOOK THIS PROJECT

02:28:56.761 --> 02:29:03.301 region:rollup2
IN SOME WAYS WE WERE FORCED INTO

02:28:59.798 --> 02:29:08.339 region:rollup2
THAT'S BECAUSE THERE WASN'T A

02:29:03.301 --> 02:29:09.007 region:rollup2
SYSTEM AVAILABLE FOR US BUT. OUT

02:29:08.339 --> 02:29:09.607 region:rollup2
WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THE BECAUSE OF

02:29:09.007 --> 02:29:10.241 region:rollup2
OUR SIZE AND BECAUSE OF THE

02:29:09.607 --> 02:29:10.842 region:rollup2
RESOURCES WE HAVE WE WANT TO BE

02:29:10.241 --> 02:29:11.376 region:rollup2
ABLE TO DO THE SAME WAY. THAT

02:29:10.842 --> 02:29:11.976 region:rollup2
CAN BE SHARED WITH OTHER

02:29:11.376 --> 02:29:12.544 region:rollup2
JURISDICTIONS IN WHOLE OR IN

02:29:11.976 --> 02:29:13.144 region:rollup2
PART AND WHERE ARE THE OPEN

02:29:12.544 --> 02:29:13.511 region:rollup2
SOURCE DEVELOPMENT WILL ENABLE

02:29:13.144 --> 02:29:14.145 region:rollup2
US TO DO THAT.

02:29:13.511 --> 02:29:15.079 region:rollup2
OKAY. MYTHS ABOUT IT'S BECAUSE

02:29:14.145 --> 02:29:15.613 region:rollup2
IT'S PRETTY QUICK ANSWER FOR ME

02:29:15.079 --> 02:29:19.317 region:rollup2
AND THAT IS WE WERE OP ARE

02:29:15.613 --> 02:29:20.985 region:rollup2
LOOKING FOR SYSTEM TO. A

02:29:19.317 --> 02:29:22.120 region:rollup2
MORE OPEN TO OPEN SOURCE AND

02:29:20.985 --> 02:29:23.488 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT THOSE SYSTEMS I THINK

02:29:22.120 --> 02:29:24.689 region:rollup2
THAT THE GOOD THING ABOUT OPEN

02:29:23.488 --> 02:29:25.723 region:rollup2
SOURCE IS THERE'S OTHER THINGS

02:29:24.689 --> 02:29:27.158 region:rollup2
THAT ARE HAPPENING SUCH A

02:29:25.723 --> 02:29:28.393 region:rollup2
SOVEREIGN DEPENDENCE IN THE

02:29:27.158 --> 02:29:30.995 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL FOR END TO END

02:29:28.393 --> 02:29:31.462 region:rollup2
VERIFIABLE SYSTEM SO. GOOD STUFF

02:29:30.995 --> 02:29:32.497 region:rollup2
THAT ARE HAPPENING THE

02:29:31.462 --> 02:29:33.598 region:rollup2
MARKETPLACE.

02:29:32.497 --> 02:29:34.866 region:rollup2
AND JUST AS FAR AS THE CODE

02:29:33.598 --> 02:29:36.301 region:rollup2
BEING AN ESCROW SHOULD THERE BE

02:29:34.866 --> 02:29:37.702 region:rollup2
ANY DISCREPANCY WITH THE VOTING

02:29:36.301 --> 02:29:40.104 region:rollup2
SYSTEM THEY CAN ACCESS THAT AND

02:29:37.702 --> 02:29:40.972 region:rollup2
REVIEW IT SO IT'S NOT THAT IT'S

02:29:40.104 --> 02:29:43.241 region:rollup2
LOCKED UP AND EVERYTHING.

02:29:40.972 --> 02:29:45.343 region:rollup2
SO IT SOUNDS LIKE EVERYONE'S ON

02:29:43.241 --> 02:29:47.846 region:rollup2
THE SAME PAGE WHAT WHY THE.

02:29:45.343 --> 02:29:49.113 region:rollup2
I'M A* OFFLINE BABS TENET

02:29:47.846 --> 02:30:05.330 region:rollup2
WHAT WHAT WHAT'S WHAT'S EVANS

02:29:49.113 --> 02:30:05.330 region:rollup2
NERVOUSNESS

02:30:05.463 --> 02:30:08.800 region:rollup2
THAT IT SOUNDS LIKE

02:30:08.199 --> 02:30:09.000 region:rollup2
YOU'RE ALL PRETTY AMENABLE TO

02:30:08.800 --> 02:30:09.200 region:rollup2
THIS.

02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:09.868 region:rollup2
I I.

02:30:09.200 --> 02:30:10.468 region:rollup2
I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT THAT THE

02:30:09.868 --> 02:30:22.280 region:rollup2
NERVOUSNESS IS AROUND THE OUR

02:30:10.468 --> 02:30:24.983 region:rollup2
LINE.

02:30:22.280 --> 02:30:26.084 region:rollup2
AS WELL

02:30:24.983 --> 02:30:28.319 region:rollup2
I ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WE FACED

02:30:26.084 --> 02:30:29.153 region:rollup2
IN LA COUNTY IS THAT. THAT WE

02:30:28.319 --> 02:30:30.255 region:rollup2
HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO USE EVEN

02:30:29.153 --> 02:30:32.857 region:rollup2
THE FEDERAL MONEY AND STATE.

02:30:30.255 --> 02:30:34.225 region:rollup2
PROPOSITION MONEY.

02:30:32.857 --> 02:30:35.226 region:rollup2
THAT THAT WAS AVAILABLE FOR THE

02:30:34.225 --> 02:30:38.062 region:rollup2
REPLACEMENT OF PUNCH CARD VOTING

02:30:35.226 --> 02:30:38.897 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS WE WERE NOT ABLE TO USE

02:30:38.062 --> 02:30:39.697 region:rollup2
THAT MONEY EVEN THOUGH WE STILL

02:30:38.897 --> 02:30:40.431 region:rollup2
HAVE EARMARKED UNLIKE ANYWHERE

02:30:39.697 --> 02:30:41.199 region:rollup2
NOT ABLE TO USE THAT FOR THE

02:30:40.431 --> 02:30:43.668 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT OF OUR SYSTEM.

02:30:41.199 --> 02:30:46.471 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT IS REGULATED FOR THE

02:30:43.668 --> 02:30:48.206 region:rollup2
USE OF ALREADY CERTIFIED VOTING

02:30:46.471 --> 02:30:49.274 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS WHICH WHICH LIMITS YOU

02:30:48.206 --> 02:30:50.375 region:rollup2
TO THE OPTIONS THAT ARE OUT

02:30:49.274 --> 02:30:51.976 region:rollup2
THERE AND THAT LIMITED

02:30:50.375 --> 02:30:53.177 region:rollup2
PROPRIETARY MARKET PARA WE'VE

02:30:51.976 --> 02:30:53.378 region:rollup2
WE'VE MADE EFFORTS TO CHANGE

02:30:53.177 --> 02:30:55.680 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:30:53.378 --> 02:30:57.415 region:rollup2
THROUGH THROUGH LEGISLATION ON

02:30:55.680 --> 02:30:58.249 region:rollup2
LAST COUPLE YEARS AND AND MANY

02:30:57.415 --> 02:31:01.452 region:rollup2
OF YOU HAVE BEEN PARTNERS IN

02:30:58.249 --> 02:31:01.886 region:rollup2
THAT BUT WE STILL HAVE A WAYS TO

02:31:01.452 --> 02:31:02.487 region:rollup2
GET CAUGHT UP WITH.

02:31:01.886 --> 02:31:03.354 region:rollup2
WITH THAT IN A WAY THAT WOULD

02:31:02.487 --> 02:31:06.057 region:rollup2
INCENTIVIZE.

02:31:03.354 --> 02:31:07.659 region:rollup2
NOT JUST COUNTIES BUT ALSO AT

02:31:06.057 --> 02:31:10.061 region:rollup2
THE COMMERCIAL MARKET TO START

02:31:07.659 --> 02:31:12.063 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT MORE OPEN IN THE END.

02:31:10.061 --> 02:31:12.697 region:rollup2
THEY SOLUTION

02:31:12.063 --> 02:31:13.898 region:rollup2
I THE REALITY IF I HAD A BUCKET

02:31:12.697 --> 02:31:15.199 region:rollup2
FULL OF MONEY TODAY AND I WENT

02:31:13.898 --> 02:31:16.868 region:rollup2
TO THE VOTING SYSTEM STORE TO

02:31:15.199 --> 02:31:19.437 region:rollup2
BUY A VOTING SYSTEM THERE'S. TWO

02:31:16.868 --> 02:31:20.572 region:rollup2
ON THE SHELF.

02:31:19.437 --> 02:31:22.307 region:rollup2
DO YOU THINK SO YOU KNOW THAT'S

02:31:20.572 --> 02:31:23.474 region:rollup2
JUST NOT A GOOD SELECTION REALLY

02:31:22.307 --> 02:31:25.677 region:rollup2
HE WON HAVE MORE OPTIONS

02:31:23.474 --> 02:31:27.679 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE AT ALSO WE NEED TO GET

02:31:25.677 --> 02:31:28.279 region:rollup2
THE MONEY ONE ONE THING WE FOUND

02:31:27.679 --> 02:31:29.380 region:rollup2
OUT WE DID GET THAT HALL THEN

02:31:28.279 --> 02:31:31.416 region:rollup2
THAT PROP FORTY ONE MONEY. IT

02:31:29.380 --> 02:31:32.684 region:rollup2
PAID FOR THE VOTING SYSTEM BUT

02:31:31.416 --> 02:31:34.519 region:rollup2
IT DIDN'T PAY FOR THE CARE AND

02:31:32.684 --> 02:31:36.087 region:rollup2
FEEDING OF THE VOTING SYSTEM SO

02:31:34.519 --> 02:31:37.188 region:rollup2
THAT THE WAREHOUSE THING WE HAD

02:31:36.087 --> 02:31:39.390 region:rollup2
TO HIRE A NEW STAFF PERSON TO

02:31:37.188 --> 02:31:40.458 region:rollup2
MANAGE THE WAREHOUSE AND. AND

02:31:39.390 --> 02:31:42.894 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW JUST A IT REQUIRED A

02:31:40.458 --> 02:31:45.129 region:rollup2
LOT MORE LOCAL SOURCES THAT YOU

02:31:42.894 --> 02:31:48.333 region:rollup2
KNOW FUNDING SOURCES WE HAVE TO

02:31:45.129 --> 02:31:50.401 region:rollup2
DO AS WELL AND IT'S JUST BEEN A

02:31:48.333 --> 02:31:55.606 region:rollup2
STRESS PERSONAL COUNTY. OKAY

02:31:50.401 --> 02:31:56.074 region:rollup2
ANOTHER THING I HEAR ABOUT FROM

02:31:55.606 --> 02:31:57.342 region:rollup2
FOLKS YOU KNOW AND AND

02:31:56.074 --> 02:31:57.976 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY.

02:31:57.342 --> 02:31:59.043 region:rollup2
THIS IS A SUPER SENSITIVE RIGHT

02:31:57.976 --> 02:31:59.744 region:rollup2
TO PEOPLE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT

02:31:59.043 --> 02:32:00.411 region:rollup2
THE INTEGRITY THE SYSTEM PART OF

02:31:59.744 --> 02:32:01.446 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WE HAVE A SECRET BALLOT

02:32:00.411 --> 02:32:02.013 region:rollup2
WHICH IS A VERY IMPORTANT PART

02:32:01.446 --> 02:32:02.680 region:rollup2
OF OUR SYSTEM AND YET IT IT

02:32:02.013 --> 02:32:03.348 region:rollup2
ALSO.

02:32:02.680 --> 02:32:03.982 region:rollup2
AND LEADS TO AN ACTUAL LEVEL OF

02:32:03.348 --> 02:32:05.316 region:rollup2
NERVOUSNESS FROM PEOPLE BECAUSE

02:32:03.982 --> 02:32:06.851 region:rollup2
IT INVOLVES.

INTEGRITY OF THE SYSTEM. I'M.

02:32:12.423 --> 02:32:15.860 region:rollup2
ONE THING WE HAD A HEARING A LOT

02:32:13.825 --> 02:32:17.528 region:rollup2
ABOUT AND UNITED BENNETT PANELS

02:32:15.860 --> 02:32:19.564 region:rollup2
IN FORUMS WHERE WHERE FOLKS

02:32:17.528 --> 02:32:20.531 region:rollup2

CHANGES THAT MADE BEEN MADE IN

02:32:24.869 --> 02:32:26.904 region:rollup2
THE WAY THAT WE DO AYE THAT'S A

02:32:25.970 --> 02:32:28.606 region:rollup2
LETTER TO GET YOUR THOUGHTS

02:32:26.904 --> 02:32:30.241 region:rollup2
ABOUT. IT WITH THINGS THAT WE

02:32:28.606 --> 02:32:31.275 region:rollup2
CAN TELL CONSTITUENTS IN OUR

02:32:30.241 --> 02:32:33.177 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS WHO ARE CONCERNED

02:32:33.845 --> 02:32:36.648 region:rollup2
SO THAT FOLKS CAN UNDERSTAND

02:32:35.179 --> 02:32:38.950 region:rollup2
WHAT YOU'RE DOING IN AND TO

02:32:36.648 --> 02:32:39.584 region:rollup2
ENSURE INTEGRITY IN A TIMELY

02:32:38.950 --> 02:32:42.453 region:rollup2
MANNER.

02:32:39.584 --> 02:32:43.921 region:rollup2
.

02:32:42.453 --> 02:32:44.989 region:rollup2
THERE THE YOU GET YOU GET SOME

02:32:43.921 --> 02:32:46.657 region:rollup2
FOLKS OUT THERE WHO ARE

02:32:44.989 --> 02:32:48.026 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES CONCERNED ABOUT ABOUT

02:32:46.657 --> 02:32:49.894 region:rollup2
NINE.

02:32:48.026 --> 02:32:51.963 region:rollup2
WHAT THEY MAY PERCEIVE AS?

02:32:49.894 --> 02:32:54.232 region:rollup2
SHORT CUTTING.

02:32:51.963 --> 02:32:54.866 region:rollup2
THE AUDIT PROCESS AND.

02:32:54.232 --> 02:32:56.567 region:rollup2

LET NIELSEN HIS TESTIMONY I I

02:32:59.837 --> 02:33:03.007 region:rollup2
DON'T THINK YOU WILL FIND A RED

02:33:01.205 --> 02:33:04.976 region:rollup2
STAR. IN CALIFORNIA THE DOES NOT

02:33:03.007 --> 02:33:06.944 region:rollup2
SUPPORT THE IDEA OF MOVING TO

02:33:04.976 --> 02:33:08.279 region:rollup2
WARDS A RISK WHEN MANY AUDIT

02:33:06.944 --> 02:33:08.546 region:rollup2
MODEL IN THEIR DIFFERENT WAYS TO

02:33:08.279 --> 02:33:10.248 region:rollup2
DO THAT.

02:33:08.546 --> 02:33:11.549 region:rollup2
WE ARE WORKING IN OUR

02:33:10.248 --> 02:33:12.717 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATION ON THE ON THE BILL

02:33:11.549 --> 02:33:14.452 region:rollup2
TO TO DO THAT THERE'S THERE'S

02:33:12.717 --> 02:33:15.520 region:rollup2
THAT UP BILL THAT'S ALREADY BEEN

02:33:14.452 --> 02:33:16.988 region:rollup2
INTRODUCED.

02:33:15.520 --> 02:33:18.823 region:rollup2
I IT WHICH BILLS AT THAT TIME AS

02:33:16.988 --> 02:33:20.024 region:rollup2
TO WHO'S RUNNING AT. ASSEMBLY

02:33:18.823 --> 02:33:22.427 region:rollup2
MORE QUICKLY WITH RUNNING THAT

02:33:20.024 --> 02:33:22.693 region:rollup2
HAD THE BILL NUMBER I GET IT

02:33:22.427 --> 02:33:24.062 region:rollup2
OKAY NON.

02:33:22.693 --> 02:33:25.863 region:rollup2
IT.

02:33:24.062 --> 02:33:26.898 region:rollup2
IT'S A COMPLICATED AREA IN NEEDS

02:33:25.863 --> 02:33:28.499 region:rollup2
AND NEEDS A LOT OF WORK AND SO

02:33:26.898 --> 02:33:29.567 region:rollup2
THERE THERE THERE IS A COALITION

02:33:28.499 --> 02:33:30.601 region:rollup2
OF PEOPLE WORKING BOTH INSIDE

02:33:29.567 --> 02:33:32.036 region:rollup2
THE ASSOCIATION OF CLIQUES

02:33:30.601 --> 02:33:34.372 region:rollup2
ELECTION OFFICIALS AND WORKING

02:33:32.036 --> 02:33:36.874 region:rollup2
WITH. STAKEHOLDERS AND AND.

02:33:34.372 --> 02:33:38.643 region:rollup2
ELECTION INTEGRITY ACTIVISTS ON

02:33:36.874 --> 02:33:40.378 region:rollup2
ON THAT PROCESS ONE OF THE

02:33:38.643 --> 02:33:42.747 region:rollup2
THINGS THE CHALLENGING IN THIS

02:33:40.378 --> 02:33:45.216 region:rollup2
REGARD IS IS A LOT OF THE MODELS

02:33:42.747 --> 02:33:45.483 region:rollup2
FOR IF BY ME LIMITING AUDITS ARE

02:33:45.216 --> 02:33:47.618 region:rollup2
BASED ON.

02:33:45.483 --> 02:33:49.387 region:rollup2
A STATEWIDE ELECTION RESULTS AND

02:33:47.618 --> 02:33:52.056 region:rollup2
IN CALIFORNIA WE'RE WEIRD.

02:33:49.387 --> 02:33:53.624 region:rollup2
AT. WE DISTRIBUTED AND AND WE WE

02:33:52.056 --> 02:33:55.126 region:rollup2
DON'T TEND TO THE LEGISLATURE

02:33:53.624 --> 02:33:57.695 region:rollup2
DOESN'T TEND TO MANDATE.

02:33:55.126 --> 02:33:59.097 region:rollup2
THINKS TO APPLY TO ALL COUNTIES

02:33:57.695 --> 02:34:00.298 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THERE'S A COST

02:33:59.097 --> 02:34:02.366 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATED WITH THAT AND THAT

02:34:00.298 --> 02:34:03.901 region:rollup2
CUTS HAVE TO BE PAID SO WE ARE

02:34:02.366 --> 02:34:04.669 region:rollup2
WE'RE ACTIVELY TRYING TO WORK ON

02:34:03.901 --> 02:34:06.671 region:rollup2
THE STRUCTURE THAT WOULD ALLOW

02:34:04.669 --> 02:34:08.172 region:rollup2
FOR COUNTIES TO MOVE IN THAT

02:34:06.671 --> 02:34:09.440 region:rollup2
DIRECTION I THINK IT'LL TAKE

02:34:08.172 --> 02:34:11.175 region:rollup2
AWHILE TO DO THAT. A AND OUR

02:34:09.440 --> 02:34:13.144 region:rollup2
INTENT IS FOR THAT TO BE USED AS

02:34:11.175 --> 02:34:14.412 region:rollup2
A REPLACEMENT OF THE ONE PERCENT

02:34:13.144 --> 02:34:15.646 region:rollup2
MANUAL TALLY THAT'S THAT'S

02:34:14.412 --> 02:34:16.814 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY IN PLACE THERE'S

02:34:15.646 --> 02:34:18.216 region:rollup2
UTILITY IN THE ONE PERCENT

02:34:16.814 --> 02:34:18.816 region:rollup2
MANUAL TALLY I'M WITHOUT

02:34:18.216 --> 02:34:20.485 region:rollup2
QUESTION IT PROVIDES

02:34:18.816 --> 02:34:21.953 region:rollup2
TRANSPARENCY IT'S IT'S EASY FOR

02:34:20.485 --> 02:34:23.054 region:rollup2
PEOPLE TO. OBSERVE AND

02:34:21.953 --> 02:34:25.223 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND IT'S NOT

02:34:23.054 --> 02:34:25.790 region:rollup2
STATISTICALLY BASED AND IF YOU

02:34:25.223 --> 02:34:28.693 region:rollup2
GO BACK IN THE LEGISLATIVE

02:34:25.790 --> 02:34:29.927 region:rollup2
HISTORY IT WAS INTENDED. TO

02:34:28.693 --> 02:34:31.496 region:rollup2
DEMONSTRATE THAT THE VIABILITY

02:34:29.927 --> 02:34:34.465 region:rollup2
IN THE ACCURACY OF THE COUNTY

02:34:31.496 --> 02:34:35.133 region:rollup2
EQUIPMENT NOT TO. NOT TO

02:34:34.465 --> 02:34:36.267 region:rollup2
DEMONSTRATE THAT THE OUTCOME OF

02:34:35.133 --> 02:34:40.171 region:rollup2
THE PARTICULAR CONTEST WAS

02:34:36.267 --> 02:34:47.612 region:rollup2
CORRECT RISK LIMITING AUDIT SEEK

02:34:40.171 --> 02:34:51.382 region:rollup2
TO DO THAT. THAT LATTER TO TO

02:34:47.612 --> 02:34:51.916 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY REINFORCE THAT THE

02:34:51.382 --> 02:34:52.550 region:rollup2
OUTCOME ON BASED ON THE

02:34:51.916 --> 02:34:53.151 region:rollup2
STATISTICAL MODEL IS AS AS YOU

02:34:52.550 --> 02:34:53.718 region:rollup2
WOULD EXPECTATIVA COUNT MORE

02:34:53.151 --> 02:34:53.885 region:rollup2
BALLOTS UNTIL YOU REACH THAT

02:34:53.718 --> 02:34:54.952 region:rollup2
I'M.

02:34:53.885 --> 02:34:55.586 region:rollup2
THAT THRESHOLD SO I THINK

02:34:54.952 --> 02:34:58.289 region:rollup2
THERE'S GENERAL SUPPORT I THINK

02:34:55.586 --> 02:34:59.891 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE CONTROVERSY ARE

02:34:58.289 --> 02:35:00.458 region:rollup2
CONCERNED STATE THAT THAT YOU'VE

02:34:59.891 --> 02:35:02.793 region:rollup2
HEARD.

02:35:00.458 --> 02:35:03.794 region:rollup2
AND AND AT THE EVENT THAT YOU

02:35:02.793 --> 02:35:05.596 region:rollup2
AND I RECENTLY WHERE AT I'M WERE

02:35:03.794 --> 02:35:07.031 region:rollup2
MORE ABOUT METHODOLOGY AND ALSO

02:35:05.596 --> 02:35:09.066 region:rollup2
ABOUT PRACTICE I MEAN

02:35:07.031 --> 02:35:10.902 region:rollup2
PRACTICALLY SPEAKING. OF WE HAVE

02:35:09.066 --> 02:35:13.571 region:rollup2
TWENTY EIGHT DAYS TO CERTIFY THE

02:35:10.902 --> 02:35:15.506 region:rollup2
ELECTION AFTER ELECTION DAY

02:35:13.571 --> 02:35:19.544 region:rollup2
CRITIQUE THAT INCLUDES.

02:35:15.506 --> 02:35:20.144 region:rollup2
YET NOW IT'S THIRTY.

02:35:19.544 --> 02:35:20.745 region:rollup2
THAT INCLUDES A LATE ARRIVING

02:35:20.144 --> 02:35:21.312 region:rollup2
VOTE BY MAIL BALLOTS WERE VERY

02:35:20.745 --> 02:35:21.979 region:rollup2
PROUD IN CALIFORNIA OF THE

02:35:21.312 --> 02:35:22.747 region:rollup2
DEGREE TO WHICH WE. I CAREFULLY

02:35:21.979 --> 02:35:23.381 region:rollup2
EXAMINED PROVISIONAL BALLOTS AND

02:35:22.747 --> 02:35:24.048 region:rollup2
VALIDATING COUNT THOSE THOSE ARE

02:35:23.381 --> 02:35:26.217 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT TO ENFRANCHISEMENT IF

02:35:24.048 --> 02:35:26.751 region:rollup2
YOU IF YOU TRY TO SQUEEZE IN A A

02:35:26.217 --> 02:35:28.920 region:rollup2
ROBUST AUDIT IN THAT SAME

02:35:26.751 --> 02:35:30.188 region:rollup2
PERIOD.

02:35:28.920 --> 02:35:31.956 region:rollup2
I'M SOMETHING HAS TO GIVE SO

02:35:30.188 --> 02:35:33.191 region:rollup2
IT'S A THERE'S A TIMING AND

02:35:31.956 --> 02:35:35.660 region:rollup2
OPERATIONAL CONCERN BUT

02:35:33.191 --> 02:35:36.260 region:rollup2
PHILOSOPHICALLY I DON'T THINK

02:35:35.660 --> 02:35:37.228 region:rollup2
YOU WOULD FIND A REGISTRAR IN

02:35:36.260 --> 02:35:39.263 region:rollup2
THE STATE THAT WOULD NOT AGREE.

02:35:37.228 --> 02:35:40.865 region:rollup2
WITH MOVING TOWARDS A MORE

02:35:39.263 --> 02:35:42.433 region:rollup2
ROBUST WITH LIMITING AUDIT

02:35:40.865 --> 02:35:45.570 region:rollup2
FUNCTION BIDS EDITOR I'M SORRY.

02:35:42.433 --> 02:35:47.405 region:rollup2
I WAS GONNA SAY AND I THINK TO

02:35:45.570 --> 02:35:50.074 region:rollup2
WE WERE LOOTING TO US THAT THE

02:35:47.405 --> 02:35:50.675 region:rollup2
INCLUSION OF PROVISIONAL BALLOTS

02:35:50.074 --> 02:35:52.577 region:rollup2
INCLUSION OF VOTE BY MAIL

02:35:50.675 --> 02:35:53.144 region:rollup2
BALLOTS WRITING AFTER NEARLY AS

02:35:52.577 --> 02:35:53.811 region:rollup2
PART OF THE AUDIT PROCESS.

02:35:53.144 --> 02:35:54.278 region:rollup2
AND THAT SPEAKS I THINK TO THE

02:35:53.811 --> 02:35:54.812 region:rollup2
INEFFICIENCY THE WILD

02:35:54.278 --> 02:35:55.246 region:rollup2
INEFFICIENCIES IN THE ONE

02:35:54.812 --> 02:35:56.814 region:rollup2
PERCENT MANUAL TALLY

02:35:55.246 --> 02:35:58.249 region:rollup2
AND SOME COUNTIES HAVE THE

02:35:56.814 --> 02:36:00.151 region:rollup2
PROCEDURES IN PLACE TO BE ABLE

02:35:58.249 --> 02:36:02.253 region:rollup2
TO INCLUDE THOSE AND SOME HAVE A

02:36:00.151 --> 02:36:04.622 region:rollup2
LOT OF DIFFICULTY DOING THAT AND

02:36:02.253 --> 02:36:05.122 region:rollup2
THAT. AGAIN POINTS T WHY WE

02:36:04.622 --> 02:36:06.457 region:rollup2
NEED THIS WRESTLING ON A

02:36:05.122 --> 02:36:07.825 region:rollup2
PROCESS.

02:36:06.457 --> 02:36:10.461 region:rollup2
AND HERE'S THE REALITY WHEN YOU

02:36:07.825 --> 02:36:11.996 region:rollup2
HAVE A CLOSE CONTEST AS THE

02:36:10.461 --> 02:36:13.464 region:rollup2
PERSON WHO CAN BE CITING THAT

02:36:11.996 --> 02:36:15.333 region:rollup2
STATEMENT VOTE ATTESTING TO THE

VOTE THE ACCURACY THAT VOTE. I

02:36:15.333 --> 02:36:18.302 region:rollup2
WILL BE RECOUNTING EVERY SINGLE

02:36:16.834 --> 02:36:19.637 region:rollup2
BALLOT IN THAT CONTEST DEPENDING

02:36:18.302 --> 02:36:20.771 region:rollup2
ON HOW CLOSE IT IS FROM WE'VE

02:36:19.637 --> 02:36:21.973 region:rollup2

CRUZ RACE BUT WE HAD ABOUT

I LOOKED.

02:36:44.395 --> 02:36:45.830 region:rollup2

FIFTY.

WITH REGARDS TO THE THEMES THAT

02:36:57.908 --> 02:37:00.211 region:rollup2
WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING TODAY.

02:36:58.776 --> 02:37:01.979 region:rollup2
I'VE BEEN.

02:37:00.211 --> 02:37:03.080 region:rollup2
NINA.

02:37:01.979 --> 02:37:05.049 region:rollup2
MANY THINGS WERE NOT THINKING

02:37:03.080 --> 02:37:05.583 region:rollup2
ABOUT A GIVEN THE FACT OR ABOUT

02:37:05.049 --> 02:37:07.918 region:rollup2
TO SHIFT OVER TO THIS NEW

02:37:05.583 --> 02:37:09.320 region:rollup2
SYSTEM.

02:37:07.918 --> 02:37:11.022 region:rollup2
I GUESS TWO THINGS COME TO MIND

02:37:09.320 --> 02:37:12.023 region:rollup2
FOR FOR ME ONE IS AND I WAS

02:37:11.022 --> 02:37:13.357 region:rollup2
THINKING ABOUT THIS DURING

02:37:12.023 --> 02:37:15.126 region:rollup2
EARLIER TESTIMONY AND WE.

02:37:13.357 --> 02:37:16.460 region:rollup2
I BELIEVE THAT THAT

02:37:15.126 --> 02:37:17.962 region:rollup2
THE PROVISIONS OF THE VOTER

02:37:16.460 --> 02:37:19.730 region:rollup2
CHOICE ACT AS BEFORE FIFTY AND

02:37:17.962 --> 02:37:21.732 region:rollup2
GO A LONG WAY AND CONTRIBUTING

02:37:19.730 --> 02:37:22.934 region:rollup2
TO THE THE COMPREHENSIVE

02:37:21.732 --> 02:37:24.902 region:rollup2
INCIDENT RESPONSE RECOVERY PLAN

02:37:22.934 --> 02:37:26.203 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THE. ELEVEN DAY

02:37:24.902 --> 02:37:27.939 region:rollup2
VOTING PERIOD OF VOTE SENATORS

02:37:26.203 --> 02:37:29.273 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THAT PROVISIONS THAT

02:37:27.939 --> 02:37:30.908 region:rollup2
ALLOW PEOPLE TO CORRECT THEIR

02:37:29.273 --> 02:37:32.810 region:rollup2
REGISTRATION OR MAKE CHANGES AT

02:37:30.908 --> 02:37:33.277 region:rollup2
THAT BUT CENTER AT THE TIME THAT

02:37:32.810 --> 02:37:36.314 region:rollup2
THEY'RE VOTING. THAT.

02:37:33.277 --> 02:37:37.982 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:37:36.314 --> 02:37:39.717 region:rollup2
INCREASES THE OPPORTUNITY FOR

02:37:37.982 --> 02:37:41.786 region:rollup2
VOTERS TO TO BE ABLE TO CORRECT

02:37:39.717 --> 02:37:43.020 region:rollup2
ANY ISSUES THAT HAVE IMPEDED

02:37:41.786 --> 02:37:44.188 region:rollup2
THEIR ABILITY TO TO VOTE RIGHT

02:37:43.020 --> 02:37:45.656 region:rollup2
NOW THOSE ON AVAILABLE AT

02:37:44.188 --> 02:37:47.091 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL POLLING PLACES SO. I

02:37:45.656 --> 02:37:48.859 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY THINK THAT THAT THAT

02:37:47.091 --> 02:37:49.727 region:rollup2
MODEL OF VOTING GOES A LONG WAY

02:37:48.859 --> 02:37:51.162 region:rollup2
IN ADDRESSING.

02:37:49.727 --> 02:37:52.863 region:rollup2
SECURITY CONCERNS

02:37:51.162 --> 02:37:54.432 region:rollup2
THE THE OTHER PIECE I WOULD SAY

02:37:52.863 --> 02:37:55.800 region:rollup2
IS IS AGAIN BACK TO THAT THE

02:37:54.432 --> 02:37:57.368 region:rollup2
RECLAIMING AUDIT MODEL IS.

02:37:55.800 --> 02:37:58.769 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THAT THE

02:37:57.368 --> 02:38:00.471 region:rollup2
FIVE COUNTIES THAT ARE.

02:37:58.769 --> 02:38:01.772 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTING IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN.

02:38:00.471 --> 02:38:03.140 region:rollup2
ARE ARE ALREADY STRUGGLING WITH

02:38:01.772 --> 02:38:05.309 region:rollup2
IT HOW DO YOU APPLY THE ONE

02:38:03.140 --> 02:38:06.077 region:rollup2
PERCENT MANUAL TALLY TO ABOUT

02:38:05.309 --> 02:38:07.411 region:rollup2
CENTER MODEL WHERE VOTERS ARE

02:38:06.077 --> 02:38:09.280 region:rollup2
VOTING NINE IN MULTIPLE

02:38:07.411 --> 02:38:10.915 region:rollup2
LOCATIONS SO AGAIN I THINK IT

02:38:09.280 --> 02:38:12.383 region:rollup2
JUST IT. IT IS MY BELIEF THE

02:38:10.915 --> 02:38:13.718 region:rollup2
POINT THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT

02:38:12.383 --> 02:38:15.619 region:rollup2
THAT AND A MORE ROBUST MONEY.

02:38:13.718 --> 02:38:17.221 region:rollup2
AUTUMN AND FOR ME LOOKING AT THE

02:38:15.619 --> 02:38:18.923 region:rollup2
BOAT CENTER MODEL I'M REALLY

02:38:17.221 --> 02:38:20.691 region:rollup2

WE HAVE A HARD ENOUGH TIME AND

02:38:21.759 --> 02:38:24.729 region:rollup2
SOME OF OUR AREAS WE ACTUALLY DO

02:38:23.194 --> 02:38:26.063 region:rollup2
OPERATE ABOUT CENTER WATSONVILLE

02:38:24.729 --> 02:38:26.931 region:rollup2
WHERE THEY DO THE VOTING FOR THE

02:38:26.063 --> 02:38:28.199 region:rollup2
TWENTY NINE DAYS BEFORE THE

THAT'S GOING TO WORK SO AND JUST

02:38:36.774 --> 02:38:39.276 region:rollup2
KEEPING THE SECURITY AND THE

02:38:38.075 --> 02:38:41.178 region:rollup2
ACCESSIBILITY OF ALL THOSE

02:38:39.276 --> 02:38:42.046 region:rollup2

02:42:10.421 --> 02:42:13.991 region:rollup2
AND SMALLER COUNTIES TO BE ABLE

02:42:11.722 --> 02:42:15.192 region:rollup2
TO DO THIS AND HOW BEST PRACTICE

02:42:13.991 --> 02:42:17.161 region:rollup2
SOME FILTERING OUT LIKE YOU'RE

02:42:15.192 --> 02:42:19.730 region:rollup2
SAYING WHITE NOISE ESPECIALLY IF

02:42:17.161 --> 02:42:20.064 region:rollup2
YOU END WHAT MARTIN MARTIN ARE

02:42:19.730 --> 02:42:22.032 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE.

02:42:20.064 --> 02:42:24.702 region:rollup2
THE SOUL WATCHERS ON THE WALL

02:42:22.032 --> 02:42:26.403 region:rollup2
THERE TO BE LOOK AND IT'S A IT'S

02:42:24.702 --> 02:42:27.671 region:rollup2
A LOT TO ASK FOR SO. IF THERE'S

02:42:26.403 --> 02:42:28.772 region:rollup2
ANYTHING WE CAN BE DOING ALSO

02:42:27.671 --> 02:42:31.775 region:rollup2
THE STATE LEVEL TO EITHER

02:42:28.772 --> 02:42:33.677 region:rollup2
ENCOURAGE PUSH TRAIN.

02:42:31.775 --> 02:42:35.279 region:rollup2
WOULD LOVE THAT FEEDBACK

02:42:33.677 --> 02:42:37.047 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE WANT TO LOOK AFTER

02:42:35.279 --> 02:42:38.916 region:rollup2
THE SMALL COUNTIES TO ABSOLUTE.

02:42:37.047 --> 02:42:40.584 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT THAT TO STATE YEAH

02:42:38.916 --> 02:42:41.385 region:rollup2
PLEASE I KNOW THAT IT IS YEAH

02:42:40.584 --> 02:42:43.454 region:rollup2
ONE TO SAY THAT THAT.

02:42:41.385 --> 02:42:45.089 region:rollup2
I THINK THE SECRETARY STATE.

02:42:43.454 --> 02:42:46.256 region:rollup2
I HAS DONE A REALLY GOOD JOB OF

02:42:45.089 --> 02:42:47.858 region:rollup2
DISSEMINATING THAT INFORMATION

02:42:46.256 --> 02:42:49.793 region:rollup2
VERY QUICKLY WHEN WHEN THEY GET

02:42:47.858 --> 02:42:50.494 region:rollup2
SO THE COMBINATION OF. NEIL AS A

02:42:49.793 --> 02:42:52.563 region:rollup2
RESOURCE.

02:42:50.494 --> 02:42:54.231 region:rollup2
REPRESENTING LOCAL OFFICIALS

02:42:52.563 --> 02:42:54.898 region:rollup2
AND THE SECRETARY STATE THAT IS

02:42:54.231 --> 02:42:56.233 region:rollup2
HAPPENING I THINK THERE'S

02:42:54.898 --> 02:42:57.635 region:rollup2
THERE'S MORE THAT CAN BE DONE ON

02:42:56.233 --> 02:42:58.869 region:rollup2
THAT AND THEN I THINK TWO TALES

02:42:57.635 --> 02:43:00.971 region:rollup2
FINE IT'S IT'S ACTUALLY

02:42:58.869 --> 02:43:01.538 region:rollup2

02:43:02.973 --> 02:43:05.976 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT IS.

02:43:05.075 --> 02:43:07.511 region:rollup2
EVEN IN THIS MONTH SMALL

02:43:05.976 --> 02:43:08.712 region:rollup2
COUNTIES I THINK NOW THERE'S

02:43:07.511 --> 02:43:10.381 region:rollup2
SOMEBODY WHO'S RESPONSIBLE IF

02:43:08.712 --> 02:43:12.282 region:rollup2

THE. ANA PENETRATED THAT SYSTEMS

02:44:40.537 --> 02:44:43.340 region:rollup2
AND HOW THEY WORKED ON NOW.

02:44:42.773 --> 02:44:44.608 region:rollup2
WE WANT TO LOOK AT THAT IN

02:44:43.340 --> 02:44:45.909 region:rollup2
PRACTICAL TERMS I MEAN SOME OF

02:44:44.608 --> 02:44:48.045 region:rollup2
SOME OF THAT.

02:44:45.909 --> 02:44:49.246 region:rollup2
IS BEST PREVENTED BY.

02:44:48.045 --> 02:44:51.215 region:rollup2
SECURING THE ACCESS TO THE

02:44:49.246 --> 02:44:52.516 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS AND AND I'M DOING

02:44:51.215 --> 02:44:53.650 region:rollup2
OPERATIONAL THINGS AND THERE ARE

02:44:52.516 --> 02:44:54.985 region:rollup2
OTHER THINGS I AM LOOKING LIKE

02:44:53.650 --> 02:44:56.954 region:rollup2
JUST PERSONNEL NOT GIVING UP

02:44:54.985 --> 02:44:58.355 region:rollup2
THAT PASSWORD TO THEY'RE. NOT

02:44:56.954 --> 02:45:00.491 region:rollup2
DANCING THINKING OF MOVING IN

02:44:58.355 --> 02:45:01.592 region:rollup2
THERE THAT THAT RIGHT. IDEA SO

02:45:00.491 --> 02:45:02.659 region:rollup2
SO WE'RE WE'RE DOING THAT I

02:45:01.592 --> 02:45:05.329 region:rollup2
THINK WE RECOGNIZE.

02:45:02.659 --> 02:45:06.130 region:rollup2
THAT THAT IT ISN'T GOING TO BE

02:45:05.329 --> 02:45:07.197 region:rollup2
ENOUGH

02:45:06.130 --> 02:45:08.198 region:rollup2
FOR US TO SAY THAT THAT WE DID

02:45:07.197 --> 02:45:10.501 region:rollup2
THAT IN HOUSE WE HAVE TO HAVE

02:45:08.198 --> 02:45:11.869 region:rollup2
THIRD PARTY VALIDATORS. THAT IS

02:45:10.501 --> 02:45:13.637 region:rollup2
PART OF THE CERTIFICATION

02:45:11.869 --> 02:45:16.073 region:rollup2
PROCESS IN CALIFORNIA IS THAT A

02:45:13.637 --> 02:45:17.374 region:rollup2
THIRD PARTY TESTING.

02:45:16.073 --> 02:45:19.743 region:rollup2

02:45:17.374 --> 02:45:20.778 region:rollup2
AT THE CODE AND AND RUN TEST. A

02:45:19.743 --> 02:45:23.080 region:rollup2
PENETRATION TEST.

02:45:20.778 --> 02:45:24.314 region:rollup2
VOLUME TEST ALL OF THOSE THINGS

02:45:23.080 --> 02:45:26.049 region:rollup2
BEFORE YOU GET THAT SEAL OF

02:45:24.314 --> 02:45:27.451 region:rollup2
APPROVAL TO MOVE FORWARD I THINK

02:45:26.049 --> 02:45:29.153 region:rollup2
THE THAT THE MAIN EMPHASIS IS

02:45:27.451 --> 02:45:30.287 region:rollup2
HOW DO WE CARRY THAT FORWARD SO

02:45:29.153 --> 02:45:31.522 region:rollup2
EVEN AFTER YOU'RE CERTIFIED

02:45:30.287 --> 02:45:33.357 region:rollup2
AFTER YOU IMPLEMENT IT.

02:45:31.522 --> 02:45:35.459 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY WERE MOVING TO MORE

02:45:33.357 --> 02:45:36.093 region:rollup2
AGILE MODELS WHERE WE CAN UPDATE

02:45:35.459 --> 02:45:38.128 region:rollup2
THAT SYSTEMS ON A MORE REGULAR

02:45:36.093 --> 02:45:39.563 region:rollup2
BASIS WE NEED TO BE SURE THAT

02:45:38.128 --> 02:45:40.564 region:rollup2
THOSE PROTOCOLS ARE IN PLACES.

02:45:39.563 --> 02:45:41.165 region:rollup2

SO WE ARE PARTNER WITH CAL TECH.

02:45:43.500 --> 02:45:46.703 region:rollup2
STARTING THIS MONTH ACTUALLY ON

02:45:46.236 --> 02:45:48.772 region:rollup2

ARE SYSTEMS VOTER DATABASE. DEAL

02:45:52.409 --> 02:45:55.479 region:rollup2
USE THAT AS BEST PRACTICE FOR

02:45:53.677 --> 02:45:57.080 region:rollup2
OTHER COUNTIES IN THE STATE AND

02:45:55.479 --> 02:45:57.381 region:rollup2

WEAKNESSES.

02:46:10.060 --> 02:46:14.665 region:rollup2
SO HE WOULD BE MY ONE.

02:46:11.929 --> 02:46:16.133 region:rollup2
REQUEST THEN IS THAT.

02:46:14.665 --> 02:46:18.368 region:rollup2
AS YOU GO THROUGH THAT PROCESS

02:46:16.133 --> 02:46:19.636 region:rollup2

THIRD PARTY VALIDATION GOING

02:46:24.174 --> 02:46:28.645 region:rollup2
THROUGH BUT PUBLICIZING THAT

02:46:26.443 --> 02:46:31.181 region:rollup2
PROCESS AND LETTING THE PUBLIC

02:46:28.645 --> 02:46:33.150 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT. WE ARE DOING THIS

02:46:31.181 --> 02:46:34.618 region:rollup2
SORT OF WHITE HAT HACKING

02:46:33.150 --> 02:46:36.687 region:rollup2
EXERCISES IN THAT WE'VE GONE

02:46:34.618 --> 02:46:37.688 region:rollup2
THROUGH THIS TIRE KICKING

02:46:36.687 --> 02:46:39.656 region:rollup2
PROCESS BEFORE THEY GO TO THE

02:46:37.688 --> 02:46:40.958 region:rollup2
POLLS. THERE'S LET'S FIND SOME

02:46:39.656 --> 02:46:43.927 region:rollup2
WAY TO PUBLICLY COMMUNICATE THAT

02:46:40.958 --> 02:46:45.496 region:rollup2
AND.

02:46:43.927 --> 02:46:47.197 region:rollup2
I I WANT TO.

02:46:45.496 --> 02:46:49.099 region:rollup2
FOLLOW THAT UP THOUGH WITH WE

02:46:47.197 --> 02:46:50.968 region:rollup2
DON'T WANT TO ADD EVEN FURTHER

02:46:49.099 --> 02:46:52.536 region:rollup2
TO YOUR PERSONNEL AND RESOURCE

02:46:50.968 --> 02:46:53.971 region:rollup2
BURDENS ON THAT FRONT SO THE

02:46:52.536 --> 02:46:55.172 region:rollup2
OTHER PART I'D LIKE IS IF WE ARE

02:46:53.971 --> 02:46:56.874 region:rollup2
GOING TO ACCURATELY BE

02:46:55.172 --> 02:46:58.442 region:rollup2

02:47:04.381 --> 02:47:07.017 region:rollup2
IN ADDITION THAT HUNDRED THIRTY

02:47:05.315 --> 02:47:08.819 region:rollup2
FOUR MILLION WHICH IS.

02:47:07.017 --> 02:47:10.254 region:rollup2
FOR MINOR SAYING REALLY SOLELY

02:47:08.819 --> 02:47:12.256 region:rollup2
FOCUS ON EQUIPMENT ITSELF ON THE

02:47:10.254 --> 02:47:14.658 region:rollup2
ON THE CAPITAL BUT NOT ON THE.

02:47:12.256 --> 02:47:16.159 region:rollup2
AND AND NOT ON THE PERSONNEL.

02:47:14.658 --> 02:47:17.961 region:rollup2
FEEDBACK ON THAT FRONT WILL BE

02:47:16.159 --> 02:47:19.196 region:rollup2
VERY VERY HELPFUL

02:47:17.961 --> 02:47:21.131 region:rollup2
BECAUSE YOU KNOW IF THERE IS.

02:47:19.196 --> 02:47:22.933 region:rollup2
ONE MORE PERSON.

CERTAIN OTHER THINGS THAT IT

02:48:09.613 --> 02:48:12.416 region:rollup2

STATE TO SUPPORT COUNTIES ON.

02:48:12.416 --> 02:48:15.285 region:rollup2

SO I GET SAD I ADMIT WHEN I WAS

02:48:20.724 --> 02:48:24.828 region:rollup2
PRESIDENT. OF CC GO WAS WORKING

02:48:23.160 --> 02:48:27.931 region:rollup2
CLOSELY THE SECTOR STATES OFFICE

02:48:24.828 --> 02:48:28.465 region:rollup2
IDENTIFYING WHAT WOULD BE THE

02:48:27.931 --> 02:48:29.433 region:rollup2
CAPITAL INVESTMENT NEEDED

02:48:28.465 --> 02:48:30.968 region:rollup2
ACROSS THE STATE. AND THAT

02:48:29.433 --> 02:48:31.668 region:rollup2
NUMBER IS ACTUALLY CLOSER ABOUT

02:48:30.968 --> 02:48:33.503 region:rollup2
FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION

02:48:31.668 --> 02:48:35.205 region:rollup2
DOLLARS THAT SIMILAR TO THE THE

02:48:33.503 --> 02:48:36.173 region:rollup2
BOND GET ALL THE ANSWER THAT'S

02:48:35.205 --> 02:48:37.908 region:rollup2
CORRECT AND THAT TAKES IN

02:48:36.173 --> 02:48:39.643 region:rollup2
CAPITAL ONLY DOESN'T TAKE AND

02:48:37.908 --> 02:48:40.243 region:rollup2
THEN WRITE DOT THING IN THE

02:48:39.643 --> 02:48:40.477 region:rollup2
TRAINING AND OTHER ADDITIONAL

02:48:40.243 --> 02:48:41.411 region:rollup2
COSTS.

02:48:40.477 --> 02:48:42.679 region:rollup2
OKAY.

02:48:41.411 --> 02:48:44.514 region:rollup2
AND THEN OF COURSE I AM I AM

02:48:42.679 --> 02:48:45.816 region:rollup2
VERY GRATEFUL TO THE GOVERNOR OF

02:48:44.514 --> 02:48:47.484 region:rollup2
FOR INCLUDING THAT THAT AND WE

02:48:45.816 --> 02:48:48.518 region:rollup2
ALSO I THINK A COLLECTIVELY AS

02:48:47.484 --> 02:48:49.419 region:rollup2
WELL AS MY COLLEAGUES ACROSS THE

02:48:48.518 --> 02:48:51.154 region:rollup2
STATE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT

02:48:49.419 --> 02:48:52.356 region:rollup2
MANDATES AND YOU KNOW THAT THAT

02:48:51.154 --> 02:48:53.991 region:rollup2
FUNDING THAT.

02:48:52.356 --> 02:48:56.526 region:rollup2
HAS BEEN TAKEN AWAY JUST FOR THE

02:48:53.991 --> 02:48:57.461 region:rollup2
NORMAL OPERATION PIECES IS VERY

02:48:56.526 --> 02:48:59.262 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT CHALLENGING WHEN

02:48:57.461 --> 02:49:02.532 region:rollup2
YOU'RE TRYING TO SET ASIDE MONEY

02:48:59.262 --> 02:49:03.567 region:rollup2
TO PROTECT CYBER NAM SO.

02:49:02.532 --> 02:49:05.335 region:rollup2
AND I WOULD JUST THE TWO TWO

02:49:03.567 --> 02:49:07.304 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT THAT I WOULD.

02:49:05.335 --> 02:49:08.772 region:rollup2
ADD TO THAT ONE IS THAT WHEN WE

02:49:07.304 --> 02:49:10.440 region:rollup2
LOOK AT THIS I THINK WE HAVE TO

02:49:08.772 --> 02:49:12.109 region:rollup2
LOOK BEYOND JUST THE EQUIPMENT

02:49:10.440 --> 02:49:12.709 region:rollup2
REPLACEMENT ONE OF A THE GREAT

02:49:12.109 --> 02:49:13.944 region:rollup2
THINGS ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING

02:49:12.709 --> 02:49:15.479 region:rollup2
IN.

02:49:13.944 --> 02:49:17.314 region:rollup2
LOS ANGELES IS THAT THIS WAS

02:49:15.479 --> 02:49:19.249 region:rollup2
BASED ON DATA FROM VOTERS AND

02:49:17.314 --> 02:49:20.517 region:rollup2
IT'S BASED ON VOTER BEHAVIOR OF

02:49:19.249 --> 02:49:22.119 region:rollup2
THE VOTERS CHOICE ACT IS BASED

02:49:20.517 --> 02:49:23.387 region:rollup2
ON THAT AS WELL BUT THE REALITY

02:49:22.119 --> 02:49:24.454 region:rollup2
IS THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT VOTERS

02:49:23.387 --> 02:49:26.223 region:rollup2
AGAIN EXPECTED WHEN IT'S

02:49:24.454 --> 02:49:27.657 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTED VOTER THIRD BY AND

02:49:26.223 --> 02:49:29.626 region:rollup2
LARGE CAN EXPECT WHAT THEY.

02:49:27.657 --> 02:49:31.261 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE ANYMORE SO A PART OF

02:49:29.626 --> 02:49:32.663 region:rollup2
THE IMPLEMENTATION COSTS WE HAVE

02:49:31.261 --> 02:49:34.364 region:rollup2
TO MAKE AN INVESTMENT IN PUBLIC

02:49:32.663 --> 02:49:35.432 region:rollup2
EDUCATION AND OUTREACH.

02:49:34.364 --> 02:49:36.700 region:rollup2
OTHERWISE IT WON'T BE

02:49:35.432 --> 02:49:38.502 region:rollup2
SUCCESSFUL WE DON'T REALIZE THE

02:49:36.700 --> 02:49:39.870 region:rollup2
FULL VISION OF THOSE REFORMS

02:49:38.502 --> 02:49:42.572 region:rollup2
JITTER IF WE DON'T DO THAT.

02:49:39.870 --> 02:49:43.974 region:rollup2
SO SO THAT'S THAT'S LIKE A

02:49:42.572 --> 02:49:45.809 region:rollup2
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT AND AND

02:49:43.974 --> 02:49:46.743 region:rollup2
JUST STAYED.

02:49:45.809 --> 02:49:48.779 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I HAVE TO I FEEL

02:49:46.743 --> 02:49:50.280 region:rollup2
OBLIGATED TO FADE THAT THAT IT

02:49:48.779 --> 02:49:51.348 region:rollup2
IS THOSE OF THOSE MANDATES I

02:49:50.280 --> 02:49:52.816 region:rollup2
MEAN FINALE COUNTY WHERE WE'RE

02:49:51.348 --> 02:49:54.217 region:rollup2

MEMBER OF THE DEPARTMENT OF

TAKEN PLACE SINCE WE FORMED.

02:52:16.126 --> 02:52:19.896 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THE RISK UP THE

SCHISM AT FIRST ERA AS TO DHS IS

02:52:19.896 --> 02:52:22.899 region:rollup2

02:57:54.531 --> 02:57:57.800 region:rollup2
VOTES.

02:57:55.765 --> 02:57:59.435 region:rollup2
I IN SUPPORT OF ULTRA RIGHT WING

02:57:57.800 --> 02:58:00.136 region:rollup2
NATIONALIST PARTY.

02:57:59.435 --> 02:58:03.306 region:rollup2
THE WHO.

02:58:00.136 --> 02:58:04.407 region:rollup2
WHO SERVICE CONVENIENT FOIL FOR

02:58:03.306 --> 02:58:05.708 region:rollup2
RUSSIA'S?

02:58:04.407 --> 02:58:07.644 region:rollup2
IT A PROPAGANDA THAT

02:58:05.708 --> 02:58:09.946 region:rollup2
BUT UKRAINE SPA AND FASCISM.

02:58:07.644 --> 02:58:11.614 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATELY. UKRAINE'S LOOKING

02:58:09.946 --> 02:58:13.016 region:rollup2
PROFESSIONALS DISCOVERED THIS

02:58:11.614 --> 02:58:14.751 region:rollup2
AND STOP HAPPY THAT DIDN'T STOP.

02:58:13.016 --> 02:58:16.419 region:rollup2
RUSSIAN STATE MEDIA AND ITS

02:58:14.751 --> 02:58:18.188 region:rollup2
OVERALL DISINFORMATION APPARATUS

02:58:16.419 --> 02:58:18.688 region:rollup2
IN SPREADING FALSE NARRATIVE

02:58:18.188 --> 02:58:19.722 region:rollup2
THAT IN FACT THESE ULTRA

02:58:18.688 --> 02:58:22.192 region:rollup2
NATIONALISTS.

02:58:19.722 --> 02:58:24.027 region:rollup2
.

02:58:22.192 --> 02:58:24.627 region:rollup2
THE EFFECT WAS TO SORT OUT

02:58:24.027 --> 02:58:27.230 region:rollup2
UKRAINE ABOUT INTEGRITY THEIR

02:58:24.627 --> 02:58:28.965 region:rollup2
ELECTION.

02:58:27.230 --> 02:58:29.532 region:rollup2
REGIONAL AND

02:58:28.965 --> 02:58:32.302 region:rollup2
GLOBAL.

02:58:29.532 --> 02:58:35.204 region:rollup2
AND ISSUED UNDER MY.

02:58:32.302 --> 02:58:36.139 region:rollup2
I THINGS EXPECT RUSSIA TO INUSE

02:58:35.204 --> 02:58:37.040 region:rollup2
ACTIVE MEASURES IN TWO THOUSAND

02:58:36.139 --> 02:58:38.007 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN I THINK.

02:58:37.040 --> 02:58:39.642 region:rollup2
THERE WERE MEASURES WILL BE

02:58:38.007 --> 02:58:40.510 region:rollup2
AIMED AT FEW FEEDING CORROSIVE

02:58:39.642 --> 02:58:41.911 region:rollup2
NARRATIVES ABOUT ELECTION FRAUD

02:58:40.510 --> 02:58:43.212 region:rollup2
ABOUT MILES TO POLLING PLACES

02:58:41.911 --> 02:58:43.913 region:rollup2
ABOUT LONG LINES AND OTHER

02:58:43.212 --> 02:58:45.915 region:rollup2
IRREGULARITIES

02:58:43.913 --> 02:58:47.417 region:rollup2
A BEFORE AND DURING ELECTION.

02:58:45.915 --> 02:58:48.484 region:rollup2
NOW NOTICE HOW THE SUCCESS OF

02:58:47.417 --> 02:58:50.053 region:rollup2
THE KREMLIN'S STRATEGY DOESN'T

02:58:48.484 --> 02:58:52.355 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY DEPEND ON ANY ACTUAL

02:58:50.053 --> 02:58:52.956 region:rollup2
HACKS IRREGULAR.

02:58:52.355 --> 02:58:54.257 region:rollup2
OF THE KREMLIN WINS BY SLOWING

02:58:52.956 --> 02:58:55.358 region:rollup2
DOWN.

02:58:54.257 --> 02:58:56.226 region:rollup2
I WISH YOU TO CUT IT WOULD

02:58:55.358 --> 02:58:57.293 region:rollup2
ACCOMPLISH

02:58:56.226 --> 02:58:58.861 region:rollup2
ABOUT MAKE IT HARD FOR US TO

02:58:57.293 --> 02:58:59.395 region:rollup2
DISCERN GROUND TRUTH

02:58:58.861 --> 02:59:00.463 region:rollup2
I TO SEPARATE FACT FROM TO

02:58:59.395 --> 02:59:04.534 region:rollup2
SUPERMAN.

02:59:00.463 --> 02:59:05.969 region:rollup2
DOUBT IS CORROSIVE TO.

02:59:04.534 --> 02:59:06.369 region:rollup2
THAT OBSERVATION TAKES ME THE

02:59:05.969 --> 02:59:08.738 region:rollup2
FIRST OF THE THREE

02:59:06.369 --> 02:59:10.306 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT WHAT WE.

02:59:08.738 --> 02:59:11.274 region:rollup2
GIVEN THIS THREAT IT IS VITAL

02:59:10.306 --> 02:59:12.709 region:rollup2
THAT ARE WATCHING PROFESSIONALS

02:59:11.274 --> 02:59:14.510 region:rollup2
PRACTICE THEIR CYBERSECURITY

02:59:12.709 --> 02:59:15.011 region:rollup2
INCIDENT RESPONSE PLANS BEFORE

02:59:14.510 --> 02:59:16.279 region:rollup2
NOVEMBER THROUGH THROUGH

02:59:15.011 --> 02:59:18.081 region:rollup2
EXERCISE.

02:59:16.279 --> 02:59:19.449 region:rollup2
I KNOW THE CONTINGENCY PLANNING

02:59:18.081 --> 02:59:20.984 region:rollup2
IS ALREADY PART THE DNA OF OUR

02:59:19.449 --> 02:59:23.119 region:rollup2
ELECTION PROFESSIONALS.

02:59:20.984 --> 02:59:24.487 region:rollup2
BUT IN THIS CONTEXT IT YOU KNOW

02:59:23.119 --> 02:59:26.356 region:rollup2
MY IN MY VIEW IS THAT IT NEEDS

02:59:24.487 --> 02:59:27.924 region:rollup2
TO FOCUS YET READY TO FOCUS ON

02:59:26.356 --> 02:59:29.359 region:rollup2
TWO GOALS ONE OBVIOUSLY MAKING

02:59:27.924 --> 02:59:30.360 region:rollup2
SURE THAT THAT THE ELECTION

02:59:29.359 --> 02:59:32.195 region:rollup2
RESULTS REFLECT WILL BE

02:59:30.360 --> 02:59:33.663 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA PEOPLE. BUT ALSO

02:59:32.195 --> 02:59:34.797 region:rollup2
UPHOLDING CONFIDENCE IN THE

02:59:33.663 --> 02:59:35.832 region:rollup2
OUTCOME

02:59:34.797 --> 02:59:37.266 region:rollup2
IT'S POSSIBLE TO CERTIFY

02:59:35.832 --> 02:59:38.201 region:rollup2
ELECTION OUTCOME AND STILL LOSE

02:59:37.266 --> 02:59:39.569 region:rollup2
THE PUBLIC'S CONFIDENCE THAT THE

02:59:38.201 --> 02:59:40.370 region:rollup2
ELECTION HAPPENED.

02:59:39.569 --> 02:59:42.338 region:rollup2
BUT THE WAY THAT THAT.

02:59:40.370 --> 02:59:43.673 region:rollup2
WE WOULD EXPECT IT TO.

02:59:42.338 --> 02:59:45.208 region:rollup2
ARE THESE EXERCISES DON'T NEED

02:59:43.673 --> 02:59:46.709 region:rollup2
TO BE ALLOWED AFFAIRS UP DID YOU

02:59:45.208 --> 02:59:47.543 region:rollup2
NEED TO BE REPLACED ENOUGH TO

02:59:46.709 --> 02:59:49.045 region:rollup2
HELP OUR PROFESSIONALS TEST

02:59:47.543 --> 02:59:51.347 region:rollup2
OTHER TECHNICAL RESPONSE PLANS

02:59:49.045 --> 02:59:52.815 region:rollup2
AND VITALLY THE PUBLIC AFFAIRS.

02:59:51.347 --> 02:59:54.283 region:rollup2
ARE THESE EXERCISES WILL HELP

02:59:52.815 --> 02:59:55.818 region:rollup2
IDENTIFY AND RESOLVE PROBLEMS I

02:59:54.283 --> 02:59:57.153 region:rollup2
GENERAL MAIL THEM TO BUILD SOME

02:59:55.818 --> 02:59:58.288 region:rollup2
MUSCLE MEMORY AROUND HOW DOES

02:59:57.153 --> 02:59:59.355 region:rollup2
NOT RESPOND TO CYBERSECURITY

02:59:58.288 --> 03:00:01.124 region:rollup2
INCIDENTS REGARDLESS A

02:59:59.355 --> 03:00:01.758 region:rollup2
PERPETRATOR INCLUDING. ANY

03:00:01.124 --> 03:00:02.158 region:rollup2
ACTIVE MEASURES THEY MAY EMANATE

03:00:01.758 --> 03:00:04.861 region:rollup2
FROM.

03:00:02.158 --> 03:00:06.129 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHAT WAS RECOMMENDED.

03:00:04.861 --> 03:00:06.829 region:rollup2
MY SECOND RECOMMENDATION IS THAT

03:00:06.129 --> 03:00:08.498 region:rollup2
THOSE OF YOU RUNNING FOR

03:00:06.829 --> 03:00:09.866 region:rollup2

POLL BOOKING OR DISTRICT STARTS

03:00:15.004 --> 03:00:18.441 region:rollup2
TO DEVELOP ON ELECTION DAY.

03:00:16.673 --> 03:00:19.442 region:rollup2

03:00:22.745 --> 03:00:25.815 region:rollup2
HOOSIER TEAM CALLED THE FIRST

03:00:23.846 --> 03:00:27.050 region:rollup2
INSTANCE FOR GROUND.

03:00:25.815 --> 03:00:29.318 region:rollup2
A WHAT DO DILLON IS APPROPRIATE

03:00:27.050 --> 03:00:30.353 region:rollup2
A BEFORE MAKING.

03:00:29.318 --> 03:00:30.920 region:rollup2
I SPENT MOST OF MY CAREER THE

03:00:30.353 --> 03:00:32.488 region:rollup2
INTERSECTION OF POLITICS AND

03:00:30.920 --> 03:00:34.190 region:rollup2
POLICY.

03:00:32.488 --> 03:00:35.958 region:rollup2
AND POST IT IN POLICY SO I FULLY

03:00:34.190 --> 03:00:37.660 region:rollup2
APPRECIATE THE RELENTLESS.

03:00:35.958 --> 03:00:39.162 region:rollup2
AT NEW CYCLE AND HOW INTENSE

03:00:37.660 --> 03:00:41.297 region:rollup2
CAMPAIGNS CAN BE A THAT SAID

03:00:39.162 --> 03:00:41.931 region:rollup2
DON'T ALLOW YOU YOUR CAMPAIGN TO

03:00:41.297 --> 03:00:43.933 region:rollup2
BE CAUGHT BY THE KREMLIN IS PART

03:00:41.931 --> 03:00:45.201 region:rollup2
OF AN ACTIVE.

03:00:43.933 --> 03:00:46.302 region:rollup2
MY ADVICE IS TO DEVELOP INSTANT

03:00:45.201 --> 03:00:46.836 region:rollup2
RESPONSE YOUR OWN INCIDENT

03:00:46.302 --> 03:00:48.705 region:rollup2
RESPONSE PLANS IN ADVANCE

03:00:46.836 --> 03:00:50.206 region:rollup2
PRACTICE.

03:00:48.705 --> 03:00:51.974 region:rollup2
IDEALLY DEVELOPMENT COORDINATION

03:00:50.206 --> 03:00:54.510 region:rollup2
WITH WITHOUT ELECTION OFFICIALS

03:00:51.974 --> 03:00:55.111 region:rollup2
WHO WHO ARE YOU FOR FROM TODAY

03:00:54.510 --> 03:00:56.379 region:rollup2
AND BY THE WAY TO MANAGE YOUR

03:00:55.111 --> 03:00:57.547 region:rollup2
OPPONENTS TO THE SAME.

03:00:56.379 --> 03:00:58.915 region:rollup2
BOB DON'T STOP THEIR POLITICAL

03:00:57.547 --> 03:01:00.650 region:rollup2
CAMPAIGNS ARE ARE VITAL

03:00:58.915 --> 03:01:02.018 region:rollup2
ELECTORAL INFRASTRUCTURE AS WELL

03:01:00.650 --> 03:01:03.486 region:rollup2
BY DIFFERENT OF COURSE THAN.

03:01:02.018 --> 03:01:04.821 region:rollup2
THE INFRASTRUCTURE ADMINISTERED

03:01:03.486 --> 03:01:06.022 region:rollup2
BY STATE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS BUT

03:01:04.821 --> 03:01:07.356 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT IN THE LAST.

03:01:06.022 --> 03:01:08.725 region:rollup2
I CAMPAIGNS MUST ALSO INFLUENCE

03:01:07.356 --> 03:01:09.292 region:rollup2
ARE RISKY BEST PRACTICES TO

03:01:08.725 --> 03:01:10.426 region:rollup2
PROTECT THEIR SYSTEMS AND IT

03:01:09.292 --> 03:01:10.960 region:rollup2
WILL COMPROMISE.

03:01:10.426 --> 03:01:12.528 region:rollup2
IT STARTS WITH CREATING A

03:01:10.960 --> 03:01:13.129 region:rollup2
CULTURE.

03:01:12.528 --> 03:01:14.997 region:rollup2
SECURITY AND AND BUILDING FROM

03:01:13.129 --> 03:01:15.965 region:rollup2
THERE.

03:01:14.997 --> 03:01:17.166 region:rollup2
WHAT CLOSE WITH A THIRD

03:01:15.965 --> 03:01:18.968 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATION A TOPIC IT'S A

03:01:17.166 --> 03:01:20.203 region:rollup2
BIT MORE FUTURE ORIENTED BUT I

03:01:18.968 --> 03:01:21.637 region:rollup2
THINK I ACTION MUST BUS START

03:01:20.203 --> 03:01:22.772 region:rollup2
NOW?

03:01:21.637 --> 03:01:24.507 region:rollup2
PICKED UP ON SENATOR STEARNS

03:01:22.772 --> 03:01:26.776 region:rollup2
APPOINT A OPENING COMMENTS WHERE

03:01:24.507 --> 03:01:29.245 region:rollup2
HE DESCRIBED ELECTORAL SYSTEM AS

03:01:26.776 --> 03:01:30.980 region:rollup2
THE BONES OF OUR DEMOCRACY.

03:01:29.245 --> 03:01:32.515 region:rollup2
CIVIC DISCOURSE I WOULD ARGUE

03:01:30.980 --> 03:01:34.250 region:rollup2
IS THE SOLE.

03:01:32.515 --> 03:01:35.752 region:rollup2
AREN'T WE PARTY SCENE THE TOXIC

03:01:34.250 --> 03:01:37.653 region:rollup2
IMPACT THE FAKE NEWS CAN HAVE.

03:01:35.752 --> 03:01:38.588 region:rollup2
AND THE FORM OF DOCTORED PHOTOS

03:01:37.653 --> 03:01:41.090 region:rollup2
AND MEET UP TAXED

03:01:38.588 --> 03:01:42.725 region:rollup2
ON OUR CIVIL DISORDER CIVIC.

03:01:41.090 --> 03:01:44.761 region:rollup2
OF MY STAFF RECALL THE DAMPENING

03:01:42.725 --> 03:01:46.262 region:rollup2
AYE DOCUMENT FORTHCOMING PAPER

03:01:44.761 --> 03:01:48.164 region:rollup2
WHAT'S COMING NEXT IS FAKE VIDEO

03:01:46.262 --> 03:01:48.765 region:rollup2
A SO CALLED DEEP FAKES ARE THAT

03:01:48.164 --> 03:01:50.199 region:rollup2
USE MACHINE LEARNING

03:01:48.765 --> 03:01:51.567 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGIES TO GENERATE SPOOKED

03:01:50.199 --> 03:01:53.136 region:rollup2
VIDEOS.

03:01:51.567 --> 03:01:54.837 region:rollup2
BUT THESE VIDEOS CAN DEPICT A

03:01:53.136 --> 03:01:56.072 region:rollup2
PERSON SAYING AND DOING WHAT

03:01:54.837 --> 03:01:58.141 region:rollup2
EVER THE AUTHOR THE VIDEO

03:01:56.072 --> 03:01:59.375 region:rollup2
DOESN'T DESIRES WITH POTENTIALLY

03:01:58.141 --> 03:02:00.910 region:rollup2
BREATHTAKING REALISM.

03:01:59.375 --> 03:02:02.779 region:rollup2
BUT YOU MAY SEE SOME EXAMPLES OF

03:02:00.910 --> 03:02:05.047 region:rollup2
DEEP FIX ALREADY OTHER ALREADY

03:02:02.779 --> 03:02:05.915 region:rollup2
IMPRESSIVELY PERSUASIVE AND SOON

03:02:05.047 --> 03:02:06.549 region:rollup2
IT WILL BE VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE.

03:02:05.915 --> 03:02:08.484 region:rollup2
DISTINGUISHED FAKE VIDEO FROM A

03:02:06.549 --> 03:02:09.819 region:rollup2
REAL ONE.

03:02:08.484 --> 03:02:10.787 region:rollup2
OTHER MANY MOST APPLICATIONS OF

03:02:09.819 --> 03:02:12.722 region:rollup2
THIS TECHNOLOGY BUT WE'RE

03:02:10.787 --> 03:02:14.190 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY CONCERNED BUT MISUSED

03:02:12.722 --> 03:02:15.725 region:rollup2
IN ELECTION CAMPAIGNS TO MAKE IT

03:02:14.190 --> 03:02:17.426 region:rollup2
EVEN HARDER FOR AMERICANS TO

03:02:15.725 --> 03:02:18.294 region:rollup2
SEPARATE FACT WITH APPLICATION.

03:02:17.426 --> 03:02:19.962 region:rollup2
AND LEARN TRUTHS ABOUT

03:02:18.294 --> 03:02:21.197 region:rollup2
CANDIDATES AND ISSUES.

03:02:19.962 --> 03:02:22.331 region:rollup2
NOW COMPANIES SUCH AS FACEBOOK

03:02:21.197 --> 03:02:23.499 region:rollup2
AND TWITTER HAVE A SOCIAL

03:02:22.331 --> 03:02:25.568 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITY TO PREVENT THE

03:02:23.499 --> 03:02:27.370 region:rollup2
PLATFORMS I'M FOR BEING ABUSED

03:02:25.568 --> 03:02:28.771 region:rollup2
SPREAD ALMOST STEEP TAKES WHICH

03:02:27.370 --> 03:02:29.672 region:rollup2
HOLDEN TO A HIGH STANDARD.

03:02:28.771 --> 03:02:31.040 region:rollup2
BUT THE REALITY IS THAT THERE IS

03:02:29.672 --> 03:02:33.209 region:rollup2
KNOW TECHNOLOGICAL OR REGULATORY

03:02:31.040 --> 03:02:34.210 region:rollup2
SO REPORT.

03:02:33.209 --> 03:02:35.711 region:rollup2
WE MUST ALSO LOOK TO THE MEN AND

03:02:34.210 --> 03:02:36.279 region:rollup2
WOMEN WHO RUN FOR OFFICE HOLD

03:02:35.711 --> 03:02:36.712 region:rollup2
LEADERSHIP POSITIONS IN OUR

03:02:36.279 --> 03:02:38.681 region:rollup2
POLITICAL INSTITUTE

03:02:36.712 --> 03:02:39.849 region:rollup2
IT'S FOR LEADERSHIP.

03:02:38.681 --> 03:02:41.317 region:rollup2
THE RISK OF THE RISK OF MISUSE

03:02:39.849 --> 03:02:42.919 region:rollup2
OF THIS TECHNOLOGY.

03:02:41.317 --> 03:02:43.920 region:rollup2
IN AN ELECTORAL CONTEXT IS AS

03:02:42.919 --> 03:02:44.887 region:rollup2
MUCH A FUNCTION OF WHAT OUR

03:02:43.920 --> 03:02:45.288 region:rollup2
POLITICAL LEADERS CONSIDER TO BE

03:02:44.887 --> 03:02:47.023 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE NORMS

03:02:45.288 --> 03:02:48.090 region:rollup2
BEHAVIOR.

03:02:47.023 --> 03:02:49.725 region:rollup2
AS IT IS A FUNCTION OF WHAT

03:02:48.090 --> 03:02:51.060 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY CAN DO.

03:02:49.725 --> 03:02:52.862 region:rollup2
BOB PUT DIFFERENTLY EXCLUSIVE

03:02:51.060 --> 03:02:53.896 region:rollup2
FOCUS ON TECHNOLOGICAL TOOLS

03:02:52.862 --> 03:02:54.797 region:rollup2
IGNORES THE KEY ROLE THE

03:02:53.896 --> 03:02:56.766 region:rollup2
CANDIDATES FOR.

03:02:54.797 --> 03:02:58.835 region:rollup2
AND THEY'RE FOR ALLIES PLAY IN

03:02:56.766 --> 03:03:00.670 region:rollup2
SETTING ENFORCING A BREAKING OF

03:02:58.835 --> 03:03:01.237 region:rollup2
CONDUCT IN OUR POLITICAL

03:03:00.670 --> 03:03:02.305 region:rollup2
DISCOURSE CANDIDATES NEED TO

03:03:01.237 --> 03:03:03.506 region:rollup2
JOIN THE FIGHT.

03:03:02.305 --> 03:03:04.507 region:rollup2
A FOR THAT REASON I BELIEVE AN

03:03:03.506 --> 03:03:05.908 region:rollup2
ESSENTIAL PART OF MANAGING THE

03:03:04.507 --> 03:03:08.211 region:rollup2
RISK THAT THIS TECHNOLOGY POSES

03:03:05.908 --> 03:03:08.778 region:rollup2
TOWARD DEMOCRACY IS FOR LEADERS

03:03:08.211 --> 03:03:09.078 region:rollup2
TO ESTABLISH A CLEAR NORMAL

03:03:08.778 --> 03:03:10.546 region:rollup2
RESTRAINT.

03:03:09.078 --> 03:03:11.414 region:rollup2
AROUND

03:03:10.546 --> 03:03:12.982 region:rollup2
I WHICH LEADS TO MY THIRD AND

03:03:11.414 --> 03:03:13.983 region:rollup2
FINAL RECOMMENDATION.

03:03:12.982 --> 03:03:15.384 region:rollup2
CANDIDATES IN THE FORMAL

03:03:13.983 --> 03:03:16.052 region:rollup2
CAMPAIGN INFRASTRUCTURE

03:03:15.384 --> 03:03:17.753 region:rollup2
INCLUDING THE NATIONAL POLITICAL

03:03:16.052 --> 03:03:19.355 region:rollup2
PARTIES SHOULD MUTUALLY AGREED

03:03:17.753 --> 03:03:19.922 region:rollup2
TO NOT PRODUCE PROMOTER

03:03:19.355 --> 03:03:20.857 region:rollup2
OTHERWISE DISTRIBUTE A FAKE

03:03:19.922 --> 03:03:21.490 region:rollup2
VIDEO.

03:03:20.857 --> 03:03:23.326 region:rollup2
TO PICKING A PERSON WITHOUT THAT

03:03:21.490 --> 03:03:23.926 region:rollup2
PERSON.

03:03:23.326 --> 03:03:25.495 region:rollup2
OUR THEY SHOULD ALSO SENT A

03:03:23.926 --> 03:03:26.996 region:rollup2
CLEAR MESSAGE THEIR ALLIES AND

03:03:25.495 --> 03:03:28.598 region:rollup2
PROXIES THAT THEY SHOULD OUT OF

03:03:26.996 --> 03:03:29.165 region:rollup2
USES TECHNOLOGY EITHER AND

03:03:28.598 --> 03:03:30.967 region:rollup2
ENERGETICALLY CALL UP GROUPS

03:03:29.165 --> 03:03:32.134 region:rollup2
IT FIGHTS.

03:03:30.967 --> 03:03:34.170 region:rollup2
AND THAT CONCLUDES MY PREPARED

03:03:32.134 --> 03:03:34.770 region:rollup2
REMARKS I LOOK FORWARD YEAR OF

03:03:34.170 --> 03:03:37.840 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS I HOPE WE CAN HAVE A

03:03:34.770 --> 03:03:39.075 region:rollup2
WIDE RANGING HALF.

03:03:37.840 --> 03:03:40.510 region:rollup2
FIGURE MUCH CHRIS SMITH. THANK

03:03:39.075 --> 03:03:42.845 region:rollup2

03:03:40.510 --> 03:03:43.946 region:rollup2
A CHAIRED BERMAN CHAIR STERN

03:03:42.845 --> 03:03:44.981 region:rollup2
MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR INVITING

03:03:43.946 --> 03:03:46.782 region:rollup2

03:03:44.981 --> 03:03:48.985 region:rollup2
TODAY I'M HONORED BY THAT. IN

03:03:46.782 --> 03:03:50.152 region:rollup2
MY APACITY IT VERIFIED VOTING

03:03:48.985 --> 03:03:51.754 region:rollup2
I'VE WORKED WITH ADVOCATES AND

03:03:50.152 --> 03:03:53.589 region:rollup2
ELECTION OFFICIALS ON LAWMAKERS

03:03:51.754 --> 03:03:54.557 region:rollup2
FROM ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY. AND

03:03:53.589 --> 03:03:56.492 region:rollup2
I CAN TELL YOU THAT WHEN YOU

03:03:54.557 --> 03:03:58.261 region:rollup2
EVALUATE HOW STATES ARE DOING ON

03:03:56.492 --> 03:04:00.429 region:rollup2
METRICS THAT RELATE TO SECURITY

03:03:58.261 --> 03:04:01.130 region:rollup2
SOME DO BETTER THAN OTHERS. AND

03:04:00.429 --> 03:04:02.732 region:rollup2
THERE'S ALWAYS ROOM FOR

03:04:01.130 --> 03:04:04.667 region:rollup2
IMPROVEMENT

03:04:02.732 --> 03:04:06.202 region:rollup2
AND THE ONES THAT EMBRACE THAT

03:04:04.667 --> 03:04:07.603 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO IMPROVE ARE THE

03:04:06.202 --> 03:04:09.205 region:rollup2
ONES THAT DO THE BEST.

03:04:07.603 --> 03:04:10.706 region:rollup2
SO THEREFORE I'M GRATEFUL FOR

03:04:09.205 --> 03:04:11.307 region:rollup2
THIS CHANCE TO SHARE ON THIS

03:04:10.706 --> 03:04:12.208 region:rollup2
TOPIC AND THAT YOU'RE HAVING

03:04:11.307 --> 03:04:13.542 region:rollup2
THIS HEARING.

03:04:12.208 --> 03:04:14.944 region:rollup2
AND BY THE WAY I TOLD MATT

03:04:13.542 --> 03:04:16.178 region:rollup2
MASTERSON NOT TO TAKE ALL MY

03:04:14.944 --> 03:04:17.513 region:rollup2
BEST LINES BUT I THINK YOU CAN

03:04:16.178 --> 03:04:20.316 region:rollup2
LISTEN SO YOU MAY HEAR.

03:04:17.513 --> 03:04:22.184 region:rollup2
SOMETHING ECHOED IN WHAT I SAY

03:04:20.316 --> 03:04:23.953 region:rollup2
I'M JUST A FRAME UP YOU KNOW I

03:04:22.184 --> 03:04:25.621 region:rollup2
LOOK AT SECURITY AT ALL SECURITY

03:04:23.953 --> 03:04:26.956 region:rollup2
ELECTIONS THROUGH THE FILTER OF

03:04:25.621 --> 03:04:28.824 region:rollup2
HOW WILL THIS AFFECT.

03:04:26.956 --> 03:04:30.526 region:rollup2
THE ABILITY OF VOTERS TO CAST AN

03:04:28.824 --> 03:04:32.094 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVE BALLOT.

03:04:30.526 --> 03:04:33.296 region:rollup2
AND EFFECTIVE BALLOT THE IN THE

03:04:32.094 --> 03:04:34.397 region:rollup2
BALLOTS AVAILABLE TO THEM

03:04:33.296 --> 03:04:35.965 region:rollup2
THEY'RE NOT TRIPPED UP BY A

03:04:34.397 --> 03:04:37.800 region:rollup2
FAILED ELECTRONIC PULL BOOKER

03:04:35.965 --> 03:04:39.035 region:rollup2
TAMPERED REGISTRATION LIST THAT

03:04:37.800 --> 03:04:40.436 region:rollup2
THEY GET THE CORRECT BALLOT IT'S

03:04:39.035 --> 03:04:41.837 region:rollup2
PRESENTED COMPLETED IT'S

03:04:40.436 --> 03:04:44.106 region:rollup2
FEASIBLE TO MARK.

03:04:41.837 --> 03:04:46.075 region:rollup2
CHECK VERIFY CAST IT SAFELY AND

03:04:44.106 --> 03:04:46.876 region:rollup2
PRIVATELY AND THAT IT'S COUNTED

03:04:46.075 --> 03:04:48.511 region:rollup2
CORRECTLY ALONG WITH ALL THE

03:04:46.876 --> 03:04:49.612 region:rollup2
OTHER BALLOTS.

03:04:48.511 --> 03:04:51.147 region:rollup2
AND THAT WE CAN DEMONSTRATE THAT

03:04:49.612 --> 03:04:52.148 region:rollup2
FACT.

03:04:51.147 --> 03:04:53.583 region:rollup2
TO THE SATISFACTION OF THE

03:04:52.148 --> 03:04:54.517 region:rollup2
PUBLIC INCLUDING THOSE ON THE

03:04:53.583 --> 03:04:56.052 region:rollup2
SIDE OF LOSING CANDIDATES OR

03:04:54.517 --> 03:04:57.820 region:rollup2
ISSUES.

03:04:56.052 --> 03:04:58.955 region:rollup2
VOTERS NEED TO KNOW THAT

03:04:57.820 --> 03:05:00.923 region:rollup2
ELECTIONS ARE WORKING THE WAY

03:04:58.955 --> 03:05:02.825 region:rollup2
THAT THEY SHOULD OR ELSE THEY

03:05:00.923 --> 03:05:03.693 region:rollup2
WON'T HAVE CONFIDENCE TO ENGAGE

03:05:02.825 --> 03:05:06.195 region:rollup2
IN NOTHING SADDER THAN THROWING

03:05:03.693 --> 03:05:07.596 region:rollup2
A PARTY AND NOBODY SHOWS UP SO.

03:05:06.195 --> 03:05:09.532 region:rollup2
THERE OBSTACLES TO VOTING OF

03:05:07.596 --> 03:05:11.133 region:rollup2
MANY KINDS THERE ARE MANY GROUPS

03:05:09.532 --> 03:05:12.401 region:rollup2
THAT WORK HARD TO REMOVE SOME OF

03:05:11.133 --> 03:05:14.570 region:rollup2
THOSE OBSTACLES AND HELP VOTERS

03:05:12.401 --> 03:05:15.071 region:rollup2
ENGAGE INCLUDING OUR FRONTLINE

03:05:14.570 --> 03:05:16.005 region:rollup2
OF THE ELECTION OFFICIAL

03:05:15.071 --> 03:05:18.841 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY.

03:05:16.005 --> 03:05:20.209 region:rollup2
BY ENSURING THAT VOTERS KNOW

03:05:18.841 --> 03:05:22.278 region:rollup2
WE'RE TAKING ALL POSSIBLE STEPS

03:05:20.209 --> 03:05:24.580 region:rollup2
ON SECURITY WE'RE REMOVING THE

03:05:22.278 --> 03:05:25.114 region:rollup2
OBSTACLE OF LACK OF CONFIDENCE.

03:05:24.580 --> 03:05:26.349 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT'S REALLY

03:05:25.114 --> 03:05:27.950 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT

03:05:26.349 --> 03:05:29.218 region:rollup2
SECOND THING TO EMPHASIZE IN

03:05:27.950 --> 03:05:31.053 region:rollup2
CYBERSECURITY ISSUES IN

03:05:29.218 --> 03:05:33.289 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR PREVENTION AND

03:05:31.053 --> 03:05:34.490 region:rollup2
DETECTION OF TAMPERING IN BREACH

03:05:33.289 --> 03:05:36.158 region:rollup2
IS REALLY IMPORTANT BUT FOR

03:05:34.490 --> 03:05:36.626 region:rollup2
ELECTION OUTCOMES AND ENSURING

03:05:36.158 --> 03:05:39.028 region:rollup2
THAT.

03:05:36.626 --> 03:05:39.762 region:rollup2
THE VOTERS WHO SHOW UP CAN CAST

03:05:39.028 --> 03:05:40.997 region:rollup2
AN EFFECTIVE BALLOT WHAT'S

03:05:39.762 --> 03:05:42.498 region:rollup2
CRITICAL IS THE ABILITY TO

03:05:40.997 --> 03:05:44.667 region:rollup2
RECOVER.

03:05:42.498 --> 03:05:45.701 region:rollup2
BOTH REAL TIME AFTER THE FACT AS

03:05:44.667 --> 03:05:47.136 region:rollup2
COMMISSIONER MASTERSON

03:05:45.701 --> 03:05:48.404 region:rollup2
REFERENCED EVEN IF THERE IS A

03:05:47.136 --> 03:05:49.372 region:rollup2
BREACH EVEN IF THERE WAS

03:05:48.404 --> 03:05:51.273 region:rollup2
TAMPERING.

03:05:49.372 --> 03:05:53.275 region:rollup2
EVEN IF SOME SYSTEMS FAILED OR

03:05:51.273 --> 03:05:54.577 region:rollup2
CAUSE TO FAIL ON ELECTION DAY

03:05:53.275 --> 03:05:55.878 region:rollup2
THAT PEOPLE CAN STILL VOTE. AND

03:05:54.577 --> 03:05:56.946 region:rollup2
THAT THEIR VOTES ARE STILL

03:05:55.878 --> 03:05:58.781 region:rollup2
COUNTED CORRECTLY.

03:05:56.946 --> 03:06:00.750 region:rollup2
WE GO TO ELECTIONS WITH THE

03:05:58.781 --> 03:06:01.584 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS WE HAVE THEIR ELECTIONS

03:06:00.750 --> 03:06:03.252 region:rollup2
ALL THE TIME THEY'RE ALL

03:06:01.584 --> 03:06:04.654 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT NEW STANDARDS THAT WE

03:06:03.252 --> 03:06:06.288 region:rollup2
SAT.

03:06:04.654 --> 03:06:07.723 region:rollup2
THOUGH GOOD ARE NOT

03:06:06.288 --> 03:06:09.225 region:rollup2
RETROACTIVELY APPLIED

03:06:07.723 --> 03:06:11.961 region:rollup2
SO WE HAVE TO HAVE STRATEGIES

03:06:09.225 --> 03:06:14.130 region:rollup2
FOR RECOVERY NO MATTER WHAT.

03:06:11.961 --> 03:06:15.731 region:rollup2
AND SECURITY IS NOT AN ON OFF

03:06:14.130 --> 03:06:17.500 region:rollup2
YES NO THING ITS LAYERS.

03:06:15.731 --> 03:06:19.101 region:rollup2
THERE'S ALWAYS ANOTHER

03:06:17.500 --> 03:06:21.103 region:rollup2
VULNERABILITY TO BE FOUND.

03:06:19.101 --> 03:06:22.505 region:rollup2
AND IF WE SAY OUR SYSTEMS ARE

03:06:21.103 --> 03:06:23.439 region:rollup2
SECURE IT'S A LITTLE BIT LIKE

03:06:22.505 --> 03:06:24.907 region:rollup2
PAINTING A TARGET ON YOUR BACK.

03:06:23.439 --> 03:06:26.642 region:rollup2
.

03:06:24.907 --> 03:06:27.943 region:rollup2
INCREMENTAL SECURITY MEASURES

03:06:26.642 --> 03:06:29.712 region:rollup2
CAN HARDEN TO MAKE A SYSTEM MORE

03:06:27.943 --> 03:06:31.113 region:rollup2
SECURE THAN IT WAS BEFORE AND WE

03:06:29.712 --> 03:06:32.181 region:rollup2
SHOULD TAKE THOSE MEASURES.

03:06:31.113 --> 03:06:33.449 region:rollup2
WE SHOULD MAKE IT EASY FOR

03:06:32.181 --> 03:06:36.018 region:rollup2
TAMPERING TO OCCUR.

03:06:33.449 --> 03:06:38.220 region:rollup2
BUT WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT

03:06:36.018 --> 03:06:39.588 region:rollup2
THE INCREASINGLY SAVVY PUBLIC

03:06:38.220 --> 03:06:41.223 region:rollup2
ALREADY KNOWS THAT THERE'S NO

03:06:39.588 --> 03:06:43.325 region:rollup2
SUCH THING AS TAMPER PROOF.

03:06:41.223 --> 03:06:44.460 region:rollup2
BUT WE CAN SAY WE TAKE THE STEPS

03:06:43.325 --> 03:06:45.528 region:rollup2
TO ENSURE THAT NO MATTER WHAT

03:06:44.460 --> 03:06:46.862 region:rollup2
HAPPENS WILL BE ABLE TO HAVE

03:06:45.528 --> 03:06:48.564 region:rollup2
CONFIDENCE IN THE ACCURACY THE

03:06:46.862 --> 03:06:49.632 region:rollup2
OUTCOME. AND THAT EVERYBODY WHO

03:06:48.564 --> 03:06:51.467 region:rollup2
WANT TO PARTICIPATE WAS ABLE TO

03:06:49.632 --> 03:06:51.967 region:rollup2
DO SO.

03:06:51.467 --> 03:06:53.536 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT PERFECTION IT'S

03:06:51.967 --> 03:06:54.603 region:rollup2
DILIGENCE.

03:06:53.536 --> 03:06:55.171 region:rollup2
IN THAT LIGHT I WOULD SAY

03:06:54.603 --> 03:06:56.839 region:rollup2
THERE'S A NUMBER OF THINGS

03:06:55.171 --> 03:06:58.474 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA DOES WELL AND HAS

03:06:56.839 --> 03:07:00.309 region:rollup2
DONE WELL OVER TIME.

03:06:58.474 --> 03:07:01.644 region:rollup2
COMPARING WITH ALL THE STATE'S

03:07:00.309 --> 03:07:03.546 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA HAS DONE A PRETTY

03:07:01.644 --> 03:07:04.747 region:rollup2
GOOD JOB OF LIFTING UP THE ISSUE

03:07:03.546 --> 03:07:06.282 region:rollup2
OF SECURITY.

03:07:04.747 --> 03:07:07.717 region:rollup2
WE'VE BEEN A LEADER IN THIS

03:07:06.282 --> 03:07:09.051 region:rollup2
SPACE AND I THINK WE SHOULD

03:07:07.717 --> 03:07:10.286 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO LEAD. OUR

03:07:09.051 --> 03:07:10.886 region:rollup2
SECRETARIES OF STATE OVER A

03:07:10.286 --> 03:07:12.521 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF.

03:07:10.886 --> 03:07:14.090 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATIONS HAVE DONE

03:07:12.521 --> 03:07:16.058 region:rollup2
THINGS LIKE REQUIRING AUDITABLE

03:07:14.090 --> 03:07:17.960 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS REQUIRING BACKUP PAPER

03:07:16.058 --> 03:07:19.428 region:rollup2
BALLOTS CALLING FOR AUDITABLE. A

03:07:17.960 --> 03:07:21.931 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS BEFORE MOST OF THE REST

03:07:19.428 --> 03:07:23.666 region:rollup2
OF THE COUNTRY OF VOLUME TESTING

03:07:21.931 --> 03:07:25.000 region:rollup2
FOR CERTIFICATION NEW AND

03:07:23.666 --> 03:07:26.969 region:rollup2
IMPROVED CERTIFICATION.

03:07:25.000 --> 03:07:28.003 region:rollup2
TOP TO BOTTOM REVIEW OF VOTING

03:07:26.969 --> 03:07:29.638 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS INCLUDING ON

03:07:28.003 --> 03:07:32.141 region:rollup2
ACCESSIBILITY INCLUDING A

03:07:29.638 --> 03:07:33.342 region:rollup2
PARALLEL EFFORT A TASK FORCE ON

03:07:32.141 --> 03:07:34.977 region:rollup2
POST ELECTION AUDITING WHICH.

03:07:33.342 --> 03:07:35.778 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDED.

03:07:34.977 --> 03:07:37.747 region:rollup2
RESPONDING AUDITS.

03:07:35.778 --> 03:07:39.849 region:rollup2
.

03:07:37.747 --> 03:07:41.917 region:rollup2
WE'VE DONE SO MANY THINGS THAT

03:07:39.849 --> 03:07:44.553 region:rollup2
HAVE REALLY HELPED TO THEN MAKE

03:07:41.917 --> 03:07:46.722 region:rollup2
IT POSSIBLE FOR COUNTIES LIKE LA

03:07:44.553 --> 03:07:49.058 region:rollup2
AND. SAN FRANCISCO DID STEP UP

03:07:46.722 --> 03:07:51.026 region:rollup2
AND DEVELOP. MORE SECURE SYSTEMS

03:07:49.058 --> 03:07:52.928 region:rollup2
THAT MEET TODAY'S VOTERS NEEDS.

03:07:51.026 --> 03:07:54.430 region:rollup2
THEN WE'VE PILOTED THE AT RISK

03:07:52.928 --> 03:07:55.397 region:rollup2
LIMITING AUDITS IN A NUMBER OF

03:07:54.430 --> 03:07:56.398 region:rollup2
COUNTY STARTING BACK IN TWO

03:07:55.397 --> 03:07:58.400 region:rollup2
THOUSAND ELEVEN.

03:07:56.398 --> 03:08:01.003 region:rollup2
.

03:07:58.400 --> 03:08:02.872 region:rollup2
WE ALSO A PROHIBIT A CONNECTION

03:08:01.003 --> 03:08:04.673 region:rollup2
TO THE INTERNET WITH ONE NOTABLE

03:08:02.872 --> 03:08:07.143 region:rollup2
EXCEPTION THE FAX RETURN A VOTED

03:08:04.673 --> 03:08:09.311 region:rollup2
BALLOTS. OF FOR SOME VOTERS AND

03:08:07.143 --> 03:08:10.846 region:rollup2
I THINK MOST IMPORTANTLY OF ALL

03:08:09.311 --> 03:08:12.348 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA HAS UNDERSTOOD OVER

03:08:10.846 --> 03:08:13.449 region:rollup2
THE YEARS BETTER THAN A NUMBER

03:08:12.348 --> 03:08:14.783 region:rollup2
OF OTHER STATES THAT IT IS

03:08:13.449 --> 03:08:16.018 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT TO LET THE PUBLIC

03:08:14.783 --> 03:08:17.520 region:rollup2
OBSERVE ALL PHASES OF THE

03:08:16.018 --> 03:08:18.621 region:rollup2
ELECTION PROCESS THAT THAT'S A.

03:08:17.520 --> 03:08:20.856 region:rollup2
MAJOR TRUST BUILDER.

03:08:18.621 --> 03:08:23.325 region:rollup2
.

03:08:20.856 --> 03:08:24.493 region:rollup2
WHAT CAN CALIFORNIA DO BETTER?

03:08:23.325 --> 03:08:24.760 region:rollup2
IT'S BEEN TOUCHED ON BETTER

03:08:24.493 --> 03:08:26.428 region:rollup2
AUDITING.

03:08:24.760 --> 03:08:27.730 region:rollup2
.

03:08:26.428 --> 03:08:28.998 region:rollup2
RESEARCH HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT

03:08:27.730 --> 03:08:30.633 region:rollup2
SOUND AUDITS WHICH THE PUBLIC

03:08:28.998 --> 03:08:32.134 region:rollup2
CAN OBSERVE HAVE A POSITIVE

03:08:30.633 --> 03:08:33.836 region:rollup2
EFFECT ON VOTER CONFIDENCE BUT

03:08:32.134 --> 03:08:35.504 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO PROVIDE MUCH MORE

03:08:33.836 --> 03:08:36.972 region:rollup2
AUTHORITATIVE CONFIRMATION.

03:08:35.504 --> 03:08:37.840 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE CORRECTNESS IN THE OF

03:08:36.972 --> 03:08:39.041 region:rollup2
THE VOTE ESPECIALLY IN TODAY'S

03:08:37.840 --> 03:08:40.476 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENT.

03:08:39.041 --> 03:08:41.610 region:rollup2
PUT ANOTHER WAY WE SHOULD REDUCE

03:08:40.476 --> 03:08:43.712 region:rollup2
THE RISK OF CONFIRMING AN

03:08:41.610 --> 03:08:44.280 region:rollup2
INCORRECT DOT COM SO THAT'S WHAT

03:08:43.712 --> 03:08:44.513 region:rollup2
RISK RUINING AUDITS ARE ALL

03:08:44.280 --> 03:08:46.615 region:rollup2
ABOUT.

03:08:44.513 --> 03:08:48.184 region:rollup2
.

03:08:46.615 --> 03:08:49.418 region:rollup2
AND I DON'T THINK EVERYONE WILL

03:08:48.184 --> 03:08:50.886 region:rollup2
AGREE BUT THE RECENT CHANGES

03:08:49.418 --> 03:08:52.354 region:rollup2
THROUGH AB EIGHT FORTY TO THE

03:08:50.886 --> 03:08:53.722 region:rollup2
ONE PERCENT MANUAL TALLY HAVE

03:08:52.354 --> 03:08:55.391 region:rollup2
FURTHER WEAKENED IT.

03:08:53.722 --> 03:08:56.692 region:rollup2
IT CAN STILL ACCOMPLISH SOME

03:08:55.391 --> 03:08:57.793 region:rollup2
USEFUL THINGS BUT IT DOESN'T

03:08:56.692 --> 03:08:58.994 region:rollup2
CONFIRM ELECTION OUTCOMES ARE

03:08:57.793 --> 03:08:59.995 region:rollup2
CORRECT.

03:08:58.994 --> 03:09:02.298 region:rollup2
OF COURSE IT DOESN'T LIVE BY

03:08:59.995 --> 03:09:03.732 region:rollup2
ITSELF AS THE ONLY MEANS FOR

03:09:02.298 --> 03:09:05.801 region:rollup2
CHECKING AS GIL PELERIN

03:09:03.732 --> 03:09:06.836 region:rollup2
REFERENCED WE HAVE RELATIVELY

03:09:05.801 --> 03:09:08.003 region:rollup2
EASY TO OBTAIN RECOUNTS IN

03:09:06.836 --> 03:09:10.039 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

03:09:08.003 --> 03:09:11.373 region:rollup2
WHICH ARE ALSO OBSERVE.

03:09:10.039 --> 03:09:12.241 region:rollup2
NONE THE LESS EFFORTS ARE

03:09:11.373 --> 03:09:14.410 region:rollup2
UNDERWAY TO ADOPT RISK LIVING

03:09:12.241 --> 03:09:15.778 region:rollup2
GODDESS IN CALIFORNIA AND.

03:09:14.410 --> 03:09:16.779 region:rollup2
THOSE EFFORTS CAN'T HAPPEN SOON

03:09:15.778 --> 03:09:18.547 region:rollup2
ENOUGH

03:09:16.779 --> 03:09:19.782 region:rollup2
WE'RE WE HAVE CHALLENGES WITH

03:09:18.547 --> 03:09:21.784 region:rollup2
OLDER EQUIPMENT THAT MAYBE

03:09:19.782 --> 03:09:23.853 region:rollup2
DOESN'T LEND ITSELF TO GRANULAR

03:09:21.784 --> 03:09:25.020 region:rollup2
BALLOT LEVEL VERY EFFICIENT RISK

03:09:23.853 --> 03:09:26.255 region:rollup2
LIMITING AUDITS WE CAN DO

03:09:25.020 --> 03:09:28.390 region:rollup2
SOMETHING CALLED BALLOT POLLING

03:09:26.255 --> 03:09:29.658 region:rollup2
AUDITS IT'S ANOTHER KIND. OF

03:09:28.390 --> 03:09:30.659 region:rollup2
RISK LIMITING AUDIT.

03:09:29.658 --> 03:09:32.795 region:rollup2
AND.

03:09:30.659 --> 03:09:35.231 region:rollup2
THAT CAN BE DONE WITH COUNTIES

03:09:32.795 --> 03:09:37.600 region:rollup2
A CROSS COUNTY BORDER CONTESTS.

03:09:35.231 --> 03:09:39.435 region:rollup2
AND STATEWIDE CONTESTS WITH

03:09:37.600 --> 03:09:41.203 region:rollup2
RELATIVELY LITTLE EFFORT.

03:09:39.435 --> 03:09:42.738 region:rollup2
WHERE QUITMAN PERMITS OR AS WE

03:09:41.203 --> 03:09:44.506 region:rollup2
ADOPT NEW EQUIPMENT THAT DOES

03:09:42.738 --> 03:09:46.375 region:rollup2
PERMIT WE SHOULD DEFINITELY DO

03:09:44.506 --> 03:09:47.443 region:rollup2
FULL RISK LIMITING AUDITS AND I

03:09:46.375 --> 03:09:49.144 region:rollup2
AGREE WITH MILT KELLY ON THE

03:09:47.443 --> 03:09:51.347 region:rollup2
SUGGESTED TO AUDIT VOTER

03:09:49.144 --> 03:09:52.815 region:rollup2
REGISTRATION DATA BASES AS WELL?

03:09:51.347 --> 03:09:53.882 region:rollup2
THE SECOND RECOMMENDATION I

03:09:52.815 --> 03:09:55.751 region:rollup2
WOULD HAVE WOULD BE TO LIMIT OR

03:09:53.882 --> 03:09:57.386 region:rollup2
EVEN ELIMINATE ELECTRONIC RETURN

03:09:55.751 --> 03:09:58.787 region:rollup2
OF VOTED BALLOTS WE HAVE TO

03:09:57.386 --> 03:09:59.855 region:rollup2
BETTER SERVE OUR MILITARY AND

03:09:58.787 --> 03:10:01.156 region:rollup2
OVERSEAS VOTERS PRIVACY AND

03:09:59.855 --> 03:10:02.157 region:rollup2
SECURITY.

03:10:01.156 --> 03:10:03.559 region:rollup2
AND WHILE WE LIMIT OUR

03:10:02.157 --> 03:10:05.394 region:rollup2
ELECTRONIC RETURN IN THIS STATE

03:10:03.559 --> 03:10:07.830 region:rollup2
TO FAX MOST FAXES DONE OVER THE

03:10:05.394 --> 03:10:09.231 region:rollup2
INTERNET TODAY. AND HAS THE SAME

03:10:07.830 --> 03:10:10.599 region:rollup2
VULNERABILITIES AS OTHER KINDS

03:10:09.231 --> 03:10:11.967 region:rollup2
OF ELECTRONIC RETURN MATH IT'S

03:10:10.599 --> 03:10:13.869 region:rollup2
IT'S A BIG TARGET.

03:10:11.967 --> 03:10:15.404 region:rollup2
WE COULD POTENTIALLY ADD MORE

03:10:13.869 --> 03:10:17.339 region:rollup2
TIME FOR LATE ARRIVING MILITARY

03:10:15.404 --> 03:10:18.741 region:rollup2
BALLOTS AND EXPAND THE USE OF

03:10:17.339 --> 03:10:20.876 region:rollup2
TRACKING EXPRESSED LABELS AND

03:10:18.741 --> 03:10:23.112 region:rollup2
OTHER. UP PRACTICES LIKE THAT

03:10:20.876 --> 03:10:25.214 region:rollup2
THE THIRD THING AND I THINK.

03:10:23.112 --> 03:10:26.682 region:rollup2
WE'VE WE'VE SORT OF BEEN.

03:10:25.214 --> 03:10:27.783 region:rollup2
DANCING AROUND THE EDGES OF THIS

03:10:26.682 --> 03:10:28.851 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK WE SHOULD FORM

03:10:27.783 --> 03:10:30.386 region:rollup2
ELECTION SECURITY ADVISORY

03:10:28.851 --> 03:10:31.987 region:rollup2
COUNCIL.

03:10:30.386 --> 03:10:33.522 region:rollup2
SIMILAR TO THE LANGUAGE ACCESS

03:10:31.987 --> 03:10:35.457 region:rollup2
ADVISORY COUNCIL OR THE VOTING

03:10:33.522 --> 03:10:36.959 region:rollup2
ACCESSIBILITY ADVISORY COUNCILS

03:10:35.457 --> 03:10:38.193 region:rollup2
THAT EXIST A SOUNDING BOARD OF

03:10:36.959 --> 03:10:39.194 region:rollup2
TALENTED EXPERTS FROM OUR MANY

03:10:38.193 --> 03:10:40.729 region:rollup2
UNIVERSITIES AND OTHER

03:10:39.194 --> 03:10:42.865 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY HUBS.

03:10:40.729 --> 03:10:43.966 region:rollup2
SECRETARY PRETTY A MATCH THE

03:10:42.865 --> 03:10:45.567 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF

03:10:43.966 --> 03:10:47.136 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY AND OTHERS.

03:10:45.567 --> 03:10:48.671 region:rollup2
THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO CAN HELP

03:10:47.136 --> 03:10:50.139 region:rollup2
BOLSTER THE INSIDE TALENT THAT

03:10:48.671 --> 03:10:51.340 region:rollup2
ALREADY EXISTS AT THE OFFICE OF

03:10:50.139 --> 03:10:52.975 region:rollup2
THE SECRETARY AND AND AMONG THE

03:10:51.340 --> 03:10:54.843 region:rollup2
COUNTIES.

03:10:52.975 --> 03:10:56.245 region:rollup2
IT SPEAKS TO WHAT NEIL KELLY

03:10:54.843 --> 03:10:57.546 region:rollup2
SAID ABOUT USING ACADEMICS AS

03:10:56.245 --> 03:10:59.148 region:rollup2
THIRD PARTY VALIDATORS AND

03:10:57.546 --> 03:11:01.050 region:rollup2
RESOURCES AND WE STRONGLY

03:10:59.148 --> 03:11:02.685 region:rollup2
SUPPORT. OF THE EFFORTS OF THE

03:11:01.050 --> 03:11:04.086 region:rollup2
STATE TO SPONSOR CYBERSECURITY

03:11:02.685 --> 03:11:05.354 region:rollup2
TRAINING FOR COUNTIES AND WE

03:11:04.086 --> 03:11:07.289 region:rollup2
WOULD SUPPORT GATHERINGS OF THE

03:11:05.354 --> 03:11:08.457 region:rollup2
COUNTY'S IT EXPERTS FOR EXAMPLE

03:11:07.289 --> 03:11:09.992 region:rollup2
THAT ARE ALREADY WORKING IN THE

03:11:08.457 --> 03:11:11.093 region:rollup2
COUNTY SO THAT THEY CAN. SHARE

03:11:09.992 --> 03:11:12.928 region:rollup2
THEIR BEST PRACTICES AND

03:11:11.093 --> 03:11:14.697 region:rollup2
INSIGHTS MORE READILY.

03:11:12.928 --> 03:11:15.898 region:rollup2
ALONG THESE LINES LOS ANGELES

03:11:14.697 --> 03:11:17.199 region:rollup2
HAS HAD A TECHNICAL ADVISER

03:11:15.898 --> 03:11:18.367 region:rollup2
GROUP.

03:11:17.199 --> 03:11:19.969 region:rollup2
INVOLVED IN THE DEVELOPMENT F

03:11:18.367 --> 03:11:21.303 region:rollup2
THEIR NEW VOTING SYSTEM FROM THE

03:11:19.969 --> 03:11:22.671 region:rollup2
BEGINNING A PROCESS AND IT'S

03:11:21.303 --> 03:11:23.605 region:rollup2
BEEN REALLY WORTHWHILE OR ELSE

03:11:22.671 --> 03:11:24.873 region:rollup2
DEAN WOULD HAVE DID STE

03:11:23.605 --> 03:11:26.608 region:rollup2
DISBANDED US ALREADY.

03:11:24.873 --> 03:11:28.077 region:rollup2
.

03:11:26.608 --> 03:11:29.378 region:rollup2
AND I WOULD ADD THAT COLORADO'S

03:11:28.077 --> 03:11:31.580 region:rollup2
RISK LOOT RISK LIMITING AUDIT

03:11:29.378 --> 03:11:34.516 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTATION WAS SUCCESSFUL IN

03:11:31.580 --> 03:11:36.051 region:rollup2
NO SMALL PART BECAUSE OF A.

03:11:34.516 --> 03:11:36.752 region:rollup2
SLIGHTLY ON SONG BUT TREMENDOUS

03:11:36.051 --> 03:11:38.320 region:rollup2
AMOUNT OF EFFORT AND

03:11:36.752 --> 03:11:39.822 region:rollup2
COLLABORATION THAT WENT INTO

03:11:38.320 --> 03:11:42.124 region:rollup2
HAMMERING OUT ALL THE DETAILS OF

03:11:39.822 --> 03:11:43.492 region:rollup2
PROTOCOLS OF HOW TO DO IT.

03:11:42.124 --> 03:11:45.294 region:rollup2
AT A VERY GRANULAR LEVEL

03:11:43.492 --> 03:11:46.428 region:rollup2
THOUSANDS OF PERSON HOURS WERE

03:11:45.294 --> 03:11:48.797 region:rollup2
DONATED.

03:11:46.428 --> 03:11:49.798 region:rollup2
TO THAT EFFORT AND MADE IT ARE

03:11:48.797 --> 03:11:50.099 region:rollup2
MUCH MORE FEASIBLE AND

03:11:49.798 --> 03:11:51.433 region:rollup2
SUCCESSFUL.

03:11:50.099 --> 03:11:52.901 region:rollup2
.

03:11:51.433 --> 03:11:54.103 region:rollup2
AT LEAST ONE OF THE EXPERTS WHO

03:11:52.901 --> 03:11:56.071 region:rollup2
VOLUNTEERED REALLY SIGNIFICANT

03:11:54.103 --> 03:11:57.406 region:rollup2
EFFORT OF IS THE NATION'S

03:11:56.071 --> 03:11:58.240 region:rollup2
LEADING EXPERT ON AUDITING LIVES

03:11:57.406 --> 03:12:00.008 region:rollup2
RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA.

03:11:58.240 --> 03:12:01.143 region:rollup2
SO WE CAN DO THIS.

03:12:00.008 --> 03:12:02.311 region:rollup2
AND I THINK MY FOURTH

03:12:01.143 --> 03:12:04.480 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATION WOULD BE IT'S

03:12:02.311 --> 03:12:05.481 region:rollup2
PROBABLY NOW UP BY NOW KIND OF

03:12:04.480 --> 03:12:07.483 region:rollup2
OBVIOUS BUT I'LL SAY IT HIGHER

03:12:05.481 --> 03:12:08.784 region:rollup2
MATT MASTERSON.

03:12:07.483 --> 03:12:10.152 region:rollup2
A NO I MEAN FULL FUNDING FOR

03:12:08.784 --> 03:12:11.954 region:rollup2
ELECTION OFFICIALS TO BE ABLE TO

03:12:10.152 --> 03:12:13.355 region:rollup2
DO WHAT THEY NEED TO SAFEGUARD

03:12:11.954 --> 03:12:15.090 region:rollup2
THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE

03:12:13.355 --> 03:12:16.592 region:rollup2
INTEGRITY OF THE VOTE. AND THE

03:12:15.090 --> 03:12:18.193 region:rollup2
VOTER REGISTRATION ROLLS FUNDING

03:12:16.592 --> 03:12:19.361 region:rollup2
FOR ELECTION MANDATES NEEDS TO

03:12:18.193 --> 03:12:20.996 region:rollup2
BE RESTORED IN THE STATE BUDGET

03:12:19.361 --> 03:12:22.164 region:rollup2
SUCH THAT THE STATE IS A PARTNER

03:12:20.996 --> 03:12:23.332 region:rollup2
TO THE COUNTIES AS THE SECRETARY

03:12:22.164 --> 03:12:25.000 region:rollup2
SAID.

03:12:23.332 --> 03:12:27.369 region:rollup2
I'LL CLOSE BY SAYING THERE'S

03:12:25.000 --> 03:12:29.371 region:rollup2
REALLY BEEN A SEA CHANGE IN

03:12:27.369 --> 03:12:31.106 region:rollup2
THINKING ON ELECTION SECURITY.

03:12:29.371 --> 03:12:32.941 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY SINCE THE OVERT

03:12:31.106 --> 03:12:34.376 region:rollup2
ATTACKS ON OUR DEMOCRACY AND

03:12:32.941 --> 03:12:35.477 region:rollup2
WE'RE EVEN USING A WHOLE NEW

03:12:34.376 --> 03:12:37.646 region:rollup2
LANGUAGE OR VOCABULARY ON

03:12:35.477 --> 03:12:39.448 region:rollup2
CYBERSECURITY TODAY. WE'VE MADE

03:12:37.646 --> 03:12:40.916 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT LEAPS FORWARD IN

THOSE TYPES OF TRADE OFFS

03:13:44.980 --> 03:13:47.416 region:rollup2
BETWEEN ACCESSIBILITY AND

03:13:46.215 --> 03:13:49.751 region:rollup2

TO DO IS TO.

03:13:52.821 --> 03:13:57.059 region:rollup2
NOT THINK THAT WE CAN'T HAVE IT

03:13:55.157 --> 03:13:59.194 region:rollup2

.

03:14:04.032 --> 03:14:06.468 region:rollup2
OPEN DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT THE

03:14:05.334 --> 03:14:08.437 region:rollup2
ISSUES ARE

03:14:06.468 --> 03:14:10.005 region:rollup2
AND HOW DO WE RESOLVE THEM SO

03:14:08.437 --> 03:14:11.740 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE MAXIMUM

03:14:10.005 --> 03:14:15.043 region:rollup2
ACCESSIBILITY AND A SECURE

03:14:11.740 --> 03:14:16.812 region:rollup2

A PROJECT WITH THE CENTER FOR

03:14:23.185 --> 03:14:26.955 region:rollup2
CIVIC DESIGN AND OTHERS.

03:14:24.820 --> 03:14:28.624 region:rollup2
ON RISK ON REMOTE ACCESSIBLE

03:14:26.955 --> 03:14:30.792 region:rollup2
BALLOT MARKETING.

BALLOTS OVER THE INTERNET THIS

03:14:34.630 --> 03:14:37.332 region:rollup2
HAS BEEN AN ISSUE HOW DO YOU

03:14:35.531 --> 03:14:39.334 region:rollup2
SOLVE THIS PROBLEM IT IT CAN

03:14:37.332 --> 03:14:41.670 region:rollup2
BRING BENEFITS BECAUSE OF HOW

03:14:39.334 --> 03:14:43.405 region:rollup2
THE TECHNOLOGY.

03:14:41.670 --> 03:14:45.073 region:rollup2
IT BECAUSE OF ASSISTIVE

03:14:43.405 --> 03:14:46.308 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY THAT VOTERS MAY HAVE

03:14:45.073 --> 03:14:49.144 region:rollup2
IN THEIR OWN HOMES.

03:14:46.308 --> 03:14:50.479 region:rollup2
AND THAT CAN FACILITATE THE

03:14:49.144 --> 03:14:52.281 region:rollup2
PROCESS GREATLY.

03:14:50.479 --> 03:14:53.715 region:rollup2
BUT ISN'T IT.

03:14:52.281 --> 03:14:55.951 region:rollup2
POSSIBLE THAT WE CAN DO THAT

03:14:53.715 --> 03:14:57.719 region:rollup2
WITHOUT HAVING TO EXPOSE THOSE

03:14:55.951 --> 03:14:59.454 region:rollup2

LIFETIME AS FAR AS INTERNET

03:15:30.085 --> 03:15:33.689 region:rollup2
VOTING IS CONCERNED. BUT WHAT'S

03:15:32.154 --> 03:15:34.790 region:rollup2

03:23:29.264 --> 03:23:33.134 region:rollup2
THAT'S A PRETTY ATTRACTIVE

03:23:30.865 --> 03:23:35.003 region:rollup2
TARGET FOR FOR FOREIGN ADVERSARY

03:23:33.134 --> 03:23:36.604 region:rollup2
AND SO DO YOU THINK THOSE CLOSER

03:23:35.003 --> 03:23:38.573 region:rollup2
TO SMALLER LESS SOPHISTICATED

03:23:36.604 --> 03:23:40.341 region:rollup2
JURISDICTION'S OUR OUR REPORT

03:23:38.573 --> 03:23:40.909 region:rollup2

STADIUM BUT THERE'S ONE BIG EXIT

03:23:46.214 --> 03:23:49.417 region:rollup2
RIGHT CALL THAT THE ORANGE

ON THE EAST COAST SOME.

03:23:53.922 --> 03:23:57.492 region:rollup2
WHEN THESE HUGE VOTING PRECINCTS

03:23:55.523 --> 03:23:59.394 region:rollup2
VERSES.

03:23:57.492 --> 03:24:00.929 region:rollup2
A LOT OF LITTLE SMALL

03:23:59.394 --> 03:24:02.664 region:rollup2
PENETRATIONS THAT SORT OF

03:24:00.929 --> 03:24:04.699 region:rollup2
COLLECTIVELY SO THAT THIS COURT

03:24:02.664 --> 03:24:05.567 region:rollup2
I MEAN.

03:24:04.699 --> 03:24:07.368 region:rollup2
DOES THAT MEAN.

03:24:05.567 --> 03:24:10.271 region:rollup2

I THINK IT'S IT'S

03:24:13.675 --> 03:24:18.813 region:rollup2
SOME UNREALISTIC AND UNFAIR TO

03:24:16.211 --> 03:24:19.714 region:rollup2
EXPECT A LOCAL ARE COUNTY

03:24:19.714 --> 03:24:22.650 region:rollup2
THEMSELVES AGAINST.

03:24:21.116 --> 03:24:23.852 region:rollup2
THE RUSSIAN RUSSIAN MILITARY

03:24:22.650 --> 03:24:25.487 region:rollup2
INTELLIGENCE THAT IS NOT A FAIR.

03:24:23.852 --> 03:24:28.022 region:rollup2
I MEAN IF IF RUSSIAN MILITARY

03:24:25.487 --> 03:24:29.557 region:rollup2
DILIGENCE WANTS TO METAL.

03:24:28.022 --> 03:24:30.458 region:rollup2
THE ODDS ARE ON THEIR SIDE THAT

03:24:29.557 --> 03:24:31.960 region:rollup2
THEY WILL SUCCEED SOMEWHERE

03:24:30.458 --> 03:24:32.827 region:rollup2
ANOTHER.

03:24:31.960 --> 03:24:33.962 region:rollup2
THIS IS MY EMPHASIZED INCIDENT

03:24:32.827 --> 03:24:35.930 region:rollup2
RESPONSE.

03:24:33.962 --> 03:24:37.031 region:rollup2
OCCASIONS IN MY REMARKS.

03:24:35.930 --> 03:24:38.233 region:rollup2
I AM WE HAVE TO REPAIR FOR THE

03:24:37.031 --> 03:24:38.433 region:rollup2
POSSIBILITY.

03:24:38.233 --> 03:24:40.235 region:rollup2
THAT.

03:24:38.433 --> 03:24:41.302 region:rollup2
THERE'S INCIDENT.

03:24:40.235 --> 03:24:44.172 region:rollup2
AND.

03:24:41.302 --> 03:24:45.807 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW REAL OR FABRICATE.

AND ENSURE THAT DEBT THAT THERE

03:24:45.807 --> 03:24:49.110 region:rollup2
ARE ELECTION PROFESSIONALS THAT

03:24:47.342 --> 03:24:50.445 region:rollup2
ARE THAT THE CANDIDATES THAT THE

03:24:49.110 --> 03:24:52.547 region:rollup2
MEDIA ARE IN A POSITION TO.

03:24:50.445 --> 03:24:54.782 region:rollup2
PORT.

ACCURATE FACTS HAVE YOU SEEN

03:24:54.782 --> 03:24:56.885 region:rollup2
THAT DONE WELL ANYWHERE YOU MANY

03:24:56.251 --> 03:25:03.224 region:rollup2
EXAMPLES OF WHERE GOVERNMENT AND

03:24:56.885 --> 03:25:04.392 region:rollup2
PRIVATE SECTOR

03:25:03.224 --> 03:25:07.495 region:rollup2
HAD AN ADEQUATE RESPONSE THAT

03:25:04.392 --> 03:25:09.464 region:rollup2
SORT OF WAS IT QUICK RESTORATION

03:25:07.495 --> 03:25:11.633 region:rollup2
OF CONFIDENCE LEANING IN THE

03:25:09.464 --> 03:25:12.767 region:rollup2
MUSE IT'S YEAH YOU KNOW I IT'S

03:25:11.633 --> 03:25:13.601 region:rollup2
IT'S HARD FOR ME TO IDENTIFY

03:25:12.767 --> 03:25:15.637 region:rollup2
EXAMPLES BECAUSE YES.

03:25:13.601 --> 03:25:17.472 region:rollup2
THIS THIS THREAT SPACE IS STILL

03:25:15.637 --> 03:25:19.774 region:rollup2
RELATIVELY NEW REPAIRED OTHER

03:25:17.472 --> 03:25:21.543 region:rollup2
POLICY DOMAINS I THINK THAT DOM

03:25:19.774 --> 03:25:22.577 region:rollup2
HYPOTHETICALLY THOUGH LIKE WHAT

03:25:21.543 --> 03:25:24.946 region:rollup2
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN SO I I

03:25:22.577 --> 03:25:26.047 region:rollup2
THOUGHT I I THINK YOU KNOW

03:25:24.946 --> 03:25:28.149 region:rollup2
EXERCISE YOU CONDUCTING AN

03:25:26.047 --> 03:25:30.852 region:rollup2
EXERCISE THAT INVOLVES.

03:25:28.149 --> 03:25:33.721 region:rollup2
STATE LOCAL OFFICIALS THAT THE

03:25:30.852 --> 03:25:35.723 region:rollup2
STATE AND YOU KNOW THAT.

03:25:33.721 --> 03:25:36.391 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW DID ELECTION FOR

03:25:35.723 --> 03:25:40.428 region:rollup2
STRUCTURE.

03:25:36.391 --> 03:25:42.330 region:rollup2
GCC AND AND AND AND THAT'S YOU

03:25:40.428 --> 03:25:43.832 region:rollup2
SEE.

03:25:42.330 --> 03:25:46.467 region:rollup2
AND MAYBE EVEN FIGURED OUT HOW

03:25:43.832 --> 03:25:48.870 region:rollup2
TO GET MEDIA INVOLVED COULD BE

03:25:46.467 --> 03:25:51.840 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW USEFUL EXERCISE OF THE

03:25:48.870 --> 03:25:56.444 region:rollup2
DAM TO TRICK THEIR. RIGHT IS TO

03:25:51.840 --> 03:25:56.911 region:rollup2
ENSURE THE EXERCISE ACCOMPLISHES

03:25:56.444 --> 03:25:57.078 region:rollup2
ITS GOAL WHICH IS TO.

03:25:56.911 --> 03:25:59.414 region:rollup2
HOPE

03:25:57.078 --> 03:25:59.981 region:rollup2
IDENTIFY ISSUES FIX THEN BUILD

03:25:59.414 --> 03:26:01.115 region:rollup2
CONFIDENCE ENOUGH MEMORY NOT

03:25:59.981 --> 03:26:02.684 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY.

03:26:01.115 --> 03:26:03.918 region:rollup2
BECOME IT'S OWN SORT OF FEEL

03:26:02.684 --> 03:26:04.586 region:rollup2
PUBLIC AFFAIRS FIASCO RIGHT

03:26:03.918 --> 03:26:06.454 region:rollup2
BECAUSE AGAIN DUE TO THE GOAL IS

03:26:04.586 --> 03:26:06.988 region:rollup2
TO IDENTIFY PROBLEMS.

03:26:06.454 --> 03:26:07.822 region:rollup2
IT'S HARD TO DO IF IF IF

03:26:06.988 --> 03:26:08.590 region:rollup2
STAKEHOLDERS

03:26:07.822 --> 03:26:10.325 region:rollup2
I FEEL LIKE THEY CAN'T BE

03:26:08.590 --> 03:26:11.559 region:rollup2
FORTHCOMING AND ABOUT PROBLEMS

03:26:10.325 --> 03:26:14.295 region:rollup2
THAT FEAR OF YOU KNOW GETTING

03:26:11.559 --> 03:26:14.996 region:rollup2
HUNG OUT TO DRY BY THE PRESS OR

03:26:14.295 --> 03:26:17.365 region:rollup2
BY UP IN A POLITICAL.

03:26:14.996 --> 03:26:20.368 region:rollup2
RIGHT.

03:26:17.365 --> 03:26:20.935 region:rollup2
UNIT PIGGYBACK ON WHAT IS A

03:26:20.368 --> 03:26:21.569 region:rollup2
GOOD JOB AND I BECAUSE I DID

03:26:20.935 --> 03:26:23.171 region:rollup2
HAVE A SORT OF MORE CITIES AND

03:26:21.569 --> 03:26:23.972 region:rollup2
FOCUSED QUESTION YOU TO IN TERMS

03:26:23.171 --> 03:26:25.039 region:rollup2
A UTILIZING THE POWER OR YOUR

03:26:23.972 --> 03:26:25.607 region:rollup2
NETWORKS AND OTHER NETWORKS OUT

03:26:25.039 --> 03:26:26.674 region:rollup2
THERE THIS IS A LITTLE BIT

03:26:25.607 --> 03:26:27.242 region:rollup2
RELATED TO JUST SAY. YOU KNOW

03:26:26.674 --> 03:26:31.045 region:rollup2
WHILE WE'VE BEEN LEARNING.

03:26:27.242 --> 03:26:31.613 region:rollup2
SO HAVE THE ADVERSARIES.

03:26:31.045 --> 03:26:32.113 region:rollup2
I THINK WE CAN ASSUME THE

03:26:31.613 --> 03:26:32.680 region:rollup2
ATTACKERS ALREADY IN THE

03:26:32.113 --> 03:26:34.182 region:rollup2
STADIUM.

03:26:32.680 --> 03:26:34.682 region:rollup2
A I THINK THAT THERE ARE NO

03:26:34.182 --> 03:26:35.817 region:rollup2
TWELVE NOT TEN ROUTES OF

03:26:34.682 --> 03:26:36.517 region:rollup2
INGRESS.

03:26:35.817 --> 03:26:37.185 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE TO BE THINKING IN THOSE

03:26:36.517 --> 03:26:37.886 region:rollup2
TERMS AND THAT'S WHY I EMPHASIZE

03:26:37.185 --> 03:26:39.187 region:rollup2
RECOVERABILITY.

03:26:37.886 --> 03:26:41.456 region:rollup2
THE ABILITY TO RECOVER

03:26:39.187 --> 03:26:43.191 region:rollup2
REGARDLESS OF WHAT HAPPENS IS

03:26:41.456 --> 03:26:44.125 region:rollup2
REALLY CRUCIAL ANYMORE DETAIL

03:26:43.191 --> 03:26:45.827 region:rollup2
THOUGH WHAT WILLOW YOU MEAN BY

03:26:44.125 --> 03:26:46.794 region:rollup2
RECOVERY WHAT IS RECOVERY LOOK

03:26:45.827 --> 03:26:48.096 region:rollup2
LIKE YOU SO.

03:26:46.794 --> 03:26:49.964 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW SOME OF THE COUNTIES.

03:26:48.096 --> 03:26:51.866 region:rollup2
A LOT OF THE COUNTIES ACTUALLY

03:26:49.964 --> 03:26:53.501 region:rollup2
BUT I IKNOW IN PARTICULAR OF

03:26:51.866 --> 03:26:54.903 region:rollup2
ONE OF SACRAMENTO COUNTY RIGHT

03:26:53.501 --> 03:26:57.071 region:rollup2
HERE TO LEVINE PUT TOGETHER

03:26:54.903 --> 03:26:58.673 region:rollup2
REALLY OUTSTANDING DISASTER

03:26:57.071 --> 03:27:01.242 region:rollup2
RECOVERY KIND OF PLAN.

03:26:58.673 --> 03:27:03.945 region:rollup2
IT WAS VERY COMPREHENSIVE.

03:27:01.242 --> 03:27:05.480 region:rollup2
AND IT'S THE KIND OF THING THAT

03:27:03.945 --> 03:27:06.848 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW HELPS IF THERE'S A

03:27:05.480 --> 03:27:08.149 region:rollup2
FLOOD ON ELECTION DAY AND YOU

03:27:06.848 --> 03:27:09.584 region:rollup2
HAVE TO GET PEOPLE FROM THE SIDE

03:27:08.149 --> 03:27:11.119 region:rollup2
OF THE RIVER NOT OUTSIDE OF THE

03:27:09.584 --> 03:27:13.154 region:rollup2
RIVER TO COMMENT BEEN EELIN SO

03:27:11.119 --> 03:27:14.188 region:rollup2
THAT PEOPLE CAN STILL VOTE IT'S

03:27:13.154 --> 03:27:16.324 region:rollup2
ALL ABOUT PEOPLE CAN STILL VOTE.

03:27:14.188 --> 03:27:18.393 region:rollup2
BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT IF YOU

03:27:16.324 --> 03:27:20.128 region:rollup2
HAVE AN AUDITABLE SYSTEM.

03:27:18.393 --> 03:27:22.797 region:rollup2
AND YOU CAN CONDUCT A ROBUST

03:27:20.128 --> 03:27:24.232 region:rollup2
AUDIT YOU WILL KNOW WHETHER EVEN

03:27:22.797 --> 03:27:26.200 region:rollup2
IF SOMEBODY WAS IN.

03:27:24.232 --> 03:27:27.468 region:rollup2
TAMPERING WITH THE SOFTWARE

03:27:26.200 --> 03:27:29.003 region:rollup2
THAT THE OUTCOME WAS IN FACT

03:27:27.468 --> 03:27:30.905 region:rollup2
CORRECT YOU CAN IDENTIFY THAT

03:27:29.003 --> 03:27:32.073 region:rollup2
THERE WAS AN ANOMALY OR PROBLEMI

03:27:30.905 --> 03:27:33.074 region:rollup2
COULD STILL GET A CORRECT DEL

03:27:32.073 --> 03:27:34.442 region:rollup2
COM IF YOU HAVE A FULLY

03:27:33.074 --> 03:27:35.843 region:rollup2
AUDITABLE SYSTEM.

03:27:34.442 --> 03:27:37.045 region:rollup2
COURSE THEIR OTHER FACTORS YOU

03:27:35.843 --> 03:27:38.613 region:rollup2
KNOW THERE'S CHAIN OF CUSTODY

03:27:37.045 --> 03:27:39.614 region:rollup2
HAS TO BE REALLY ROBUST AND

03:27:38.613 --> 03:27:40.982 region:rollup2
OTHER KINDS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY

03:27:39.614 --> 03:27:43.084 region:rollup2
MEASURES.

03:27:40.982 --> 03:27:45.019 region:rollup2
BUT LIKE I A I EMPHASIZE THE

03:27:43.084 --> 03:27:47.188 region:rollup2
RECOVERABILITY JUST KIND OF KEEP

03:27:45.019 --> 03:27:48.623 region:rollup2
US THINKING A STEP AHEAD OF

03:27:47.188 --> 03:27:49.157 region:rollup2
WHERE OUR ADVERSARIES ARE

03:27:48.623 --> 03:27:50.725 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OUR ADVERSARIES NO

03:27:49.157 --> 03:27:52.126 region:rollup2
MAYBE.

03:27:50.725 --> 03:27:54.062 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW GET INTO A SYSTEM THAT

03:27:52.126 --> 03:27:55.596 region:rollup2
THEY FOUND A BACK DOOR INTO AND

03:27:54.062 --> 03:27:57.098 region:rollup2
JUST BEEN WAITING.

03:27:55.596 --> 03:27:58.666 region:rollup2
FOR THE RIGHT MOMENT WHICH MIGHT

03:27:57.098 --> 03:28:00.768 region:rollup2
NOT OF BEEN YOU KNOW TWENTY

03:27:58.666 --> 03:28:02.570 region:rollup2
SIXTEEN SURE WE HAVE SEEN ED

03:28:00.768 --> 03:28:03.971 region:rollup2
PATTERN OVER TIME YOU YOU KNOW

03:28:02.570 --> 03:28:05.573 region:rollup2
YOU YOU THAT'S IT LINE WEIGHT.

03:28:03.971 --> 03:28:06.374 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THAT RIGHT WHEN I MET

03:28:05.573 --> 03:28:08.276 region:rollup2
WITH A.

03:28:06.374 --> 03:28:09.010 region:rollup2
AND HIS BOSS ONE TIME HE SAID TO

03:28:08.276 --> 03:28:11.446 region:rollup2
ME.

03:28:09.010 --> 03:28:13.181 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THERE'S BASICALLY TWO

03:28:11.446 --> 03:28:14.382 region:rollup2
KINDS OF ORGANIZATIONS THE ONES

03:28:13.181 --> 03:28:16.417 region:rollup2
THAT AVE BEEN HACKED AND THE

03:28:14.382 --> 03:28:18.619 region:rollup2
ONES THAT DON'T KNOW IT YET. AND

03:28:16.417 --> 03:28:20.488 region:rollup2
IF SO AND I THINK THAT'S THAT

03:28:18.619 --> 03:28:22.990 region:rollup2
ASSUMING THAT KIND OF ASSUME

03:28:20.488 --> 03:28:25.026 region:rollup2
BREACH IS A GOOD WAY TO FIGURE

03:28:22.990 --> 03:28:27.195 region:rollup2
OUT HOW WE AND IT PROTECTION IS.

03:28:25.026 --> 03:28:29.263 region:rollup2
.

03:28:27.195 --> 03:28:30.498 region:rollup2
IS A MISGUIDED EXPECTATION I'D

03:28:29.263 --> 03:28:32.300 region:rollup2
STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT AND I

03:28:30.498 --> 03:28:34.569 region:rollup2
STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT THE PUBLIC

03:28:32.300 --> 03:28:36.004 region:rollup2
WILL UNDERSTAND THAT THAT THEY

03:28:34.569 --> 03:28:38.873 region:rollup2
DON'T EXPECT.

03:28:36.004 --> 03:28:40.241 region:rollup2
A. PERFECTION.

03:28:38.873 --> 03:28:41.776 region:rollup2
OR DON'T NEED TO EXPECT

03:28:40.241 --> 03:28:43.444 region:rollup2
PERFECTION MIGHT TAKE A LITTLE

03:28:41.776 --> 03:28:44.679 region:rollup2
EDUCATED BUT THEY DON'T EXPECT

03:28:43.444 --> 03:28:46.848 region:rollup2
PERFECTION BUT THEY DO EXPECT

03:28:44.679 --> 03:28:47.448 region:rollup2
DILIGENCE THAT YOU'RE MAKING THE

03:28:46.848 --> 03:28:50.184 region:rollup2
EFFORT AND THAT YOU CAN SHOW

03:28:47.448 --> 03:28:50.818 region:rollup2
YOUR WORK. YOU KNOW IT I THINK

03:28:50.184 --> 03:28:51.686 region:rollup2

RESOURCE FOR.

03:34:21.048 --> 03:34:24.251 region:rollup2
WHEN THE MEDIA WOULD CALL OVER

03:34:22.316 --> 03:34:25.419 region:rollup2
THE LAST ELECTION CYCLE OF YOU

03:34:24.251 --> 03:34:27.188 region:rollup2

LATER WE GET TO THE QUESTION.

03:34:35.262 --> 03:34:38.132 region:rollup2
ONCE THEY UNDERSTOOD HOW IT

03:34:36.263 --> 03:34:39.600 region:rollup2

03:34:38.132 --> 03:34:41.268 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT THE MEDIA NEEDS TO

03:34:39.600 --> 03:34:42.269 region:rollup2

SENTINEL SYSTEM IS THAT IS THAT

03:35:08.062 --> 03:35:11.165 region:rollup2

FOUR YEARS AGO I SAID.

03:41:13.360 --> 03:41:18.132 region:rollup2
THE MOST IMPORTANT THREAT.

03:41:15.262 --> 03:41:19.900 region:rollup2
SOME INSIDERS.

03:41:18.132 --> 03:41:22.536 region:rollup2
I STAND BY THAT TODAY.

03:41:19.900 --> 03:41:25.005 region:rollup2
THAT IS.

03:41:22.536 --> 03:41:26.306 region:rollup2
PRINCIPALLY THE PROGRAMMERS.

GEOFFREY DEAN'S WITH TWENTY

03:41:26.306 --> 03:41:29.510 region:rollup2
THREE CONVICTIONS FOR

03:41:27.407 --> 03:41:30.010 region:rollup2
EMBEZZLEMENT.

03:41:29.510 --> 03:41:32.212 region:rollup2
PROGRAMMING DEED PEOPLE

03:41:30.010 --> 03:41:34.515 region:rollup2
MACHINES.

03:41:32.212 --> 03:41:36.383 region:rollup2
OR CLING KURDISH BEING HIRED TO

03:41:34.515 --> 03:41:38.118 region:rollup2
WRITE CREATE A MACHINE A VOTING

03:41:36.383 --> 03:41:40.320 region:rollup2
MACHINE THAT WOULD MAKE VOTES.

03:41:38.118 --> 03:41:42.322 region:rollup2
INSIDERS.

03:41:40.320 --> 03:41:44.158 region:rollup2
THE BEST DEFENSE AGAINST.

03:41:42.322 --> 03:41:46.059 region:rollup2
VERY KIND A PROBLEM IS OPEN

03:41:44.158 --> 03:41:48.996 region:rollup2
SOURCE.

03:41:46.059 --> 03:41:49.997 region:rollup2
SO THAT THE PUBLIC CAN LOOK AT

03:41:48.996 --> 03:41:52.666 region:rollup2
IT A LOT OF PEOPLE CAN LOOK AT

03:41:49.997 --> 03:41:54.301 region:rollup2
IT IT'S NOT ABSOLUTE.

03:41:52.666 --> 03:41:55.035 region:rollup2
THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT MILLIONS

03:41:54.301 --> 03:41:57.104 region:rollup2
OF LINES OF CODE TOTALLY

03:41:55.035 --> 03:41:58.939 region:rollup2
INVOLVED BUT IT'S A DETERRENT.

03:41:57.104 --> 03:42:02.409 region:rollup2
THAT THEY MIGHT BE.

03:41:58.939 --> 03:42:02.976 region:rollup2
CAUGHT A TREND TO PUT IN

03:42:02.409 --> 03:42:03.210 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT SHOULDN'T BE

03:42:02.976 --> 03:42:06.346 region:rollup2
THERE.

03:42:03.210 --> 03:42:09.550 region:rollup2
A.

03:42:06.346 --> 03:42:12.486 region:rollup2
IBM REALLY FRUSTRATED I'VE BEEN

03:42:09.550 --> 03:42:14.221 region:rollup2
AT THIS SINCE TWO THOUSAND FIVE.

03:42:12.486 --> 03:42:16.356 region:rollup2
TO SEE THAT CALIFORNIA HAS YET

03:42:14.221 --> 03:42:18.192 region:rollup2
TO PROVIDE FUNDING FOR OPEN

03:42:16.356 --> 03:42:19.293 region:rollup2
SOURCE DEVELOPMENT.

03:42:18.192 --> 03:42:21.161 region:rollup2
AND I'VE BEEN HERE ESPECIALLY

03:42:19.293 --> 03:42:22.462 region:rollup2
THE LAST FEW YEARS SERVICES

03:42:21.161 --> 03:42:23.897 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WORKING HARD ON THIS

AND THEY'RE WORKING HARD ON

03:42:38.111 --> 03:42:41.448 region:rollup2
THIS.

03:42:39.746 --> 03:42:42.583 region:rollup2
AND I'M GLAD THAT THE GOVERNOR

03:42:41.448 --> 03:42:46.620 region:rollup2
PUT IN A HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR

03:42:42.583 --> 03:42:48.288 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLARS FOR EQUIPMENT.

03:42:46.620 --> 03:42:50.891 region:rollup2
SPUN IT THAT THERE'S NO MONEY

03:42:48.288 --> 03:42:53.460 region:rollup2
FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT.

03:42:50.891 --> 03:42:56.029 region:rollup2
IN SOFTWARE IN SYSTEMS THAT

03:42:53.460 --> 03:42:58.232 region:rollup2
WOULD SAVE CALIFORNIA. THE

03:42:56.029 --> 03:43:00.434 region:rollup2
COUNTIES AND EVEN THE STATE.

03:42:58.232 --> 03:43:01.668 region:rollup2
HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS DOLLARS.

03:43:00.434 --> 03:43:03.370 region:rollup2
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MAYBE TEN

03:43:01.668 --> 03:43:05.239 region:rollup2
TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS

03:43:03.370 --> 03:43:09.042 region:rollup2
TO SAVE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS.

03:43:05.239 --> 03:43:11.578 region:rollup2
SO MY PRIMARY ARE.

03:43:09.042 --> 03:43:13.647 region:rollup2
URGING HERE IS THAT YOU KEEP

03:43:11.578 --> 03:43:15.415 region:rollup2
THAT IN THE BUDGET.

03:43:13.647 --> 03:43:17.017 region:rollup2
THIS YEAR'S BUDGET

03:43:15.415 --> 03:43:18.685 region:rollup2
SO THAT THEY CAN MOVE FORWARD

03:43:17.017 --> 03:43:20.787 region:rollup2
THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT.

03:43:18.685 --> 03:43:23.090 region:rollup2
ALSO WON'T FUNDING FOR

03:43:20.787 --> 03:43:24.391 region:rollup2
CERTIFICATION OF ANY OTHER

03:43:23.090 --> 03:43:26.360 region:rollup2
CERTIFICATION AND TESTING THE

03:43:24.391 --> 03:43:27.895 region:rollup2
OTHER OPEN SOURCE IS.

03:43:26.360 --> 03:43:28.762 region:rollup2
THERE SYSTEMS DEVELOPED THAT

03:43:27.895 --> 03:43:30.731 region:rollup2
BEING DEVELOPED THE UNIVERSITY

03:43:28.762 --> 03:43:33.467 region:rollup2

03:43:37.170 --> 03:43:39.773 region:rollup2
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS

03:43:39.273 --> 03:43:41.041 region:rollup2
TO PAY FOR CERTIFICATION

03:43:39.773 --> 03:43:42.109 region:rollup2
TESTING.

03:43:41.041 --> 03:43:44.111 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA SHOULD HELP COVER

03:43:42.109 --> 03:43:46.513 region:rollup2
THAT.

03:43:44.111 --> 03:43:51.785 region:rollup2

SUPPORT WHAT JIM SAID A IN THAT

03:44:01.795 --> 03:44:05.232 region:rollup2
BUDGET ITEM ONE HUNDRED THIRTY

03:44:04.197 --> 03:44:06.700 region:rollup2
FOUR MILLION. IT WOULD BE

03:44:05.232 --> 03:44:09.303 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT

03:44:06.700 --> 03:44:11.138 region:rollup2
TO ALLOW THE COUNTY STILL LEASE

03:44:09.303 --> 03:44:12.873 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS RATHER THAN BY THEM.

03:44:11.138 --> 03:44:15.008 region:rollup2
FOR THE ONE REASON THAT.

03:44:12.873 --> 03:44:16.643 region:rollup2
WHEN LA DEVELOPS ITS SYSTEM WHEN

03:44:15.008 --> 03:44:18.512 region:rollup2
SENATORS CO DEVELOPED THAT

03:44:16.643 --> 03:44:20.714 region:rollup2
SYSTEM. THEY WILL PICK UP MADE

03:44:18.512 --> 03:44:23.383 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE AT A GREATLY REDUCED

03:44:20.714 --> 03:44:23.850 region:rollup2
PRICE TO THE OTHER COUNTIES THEN

03:44:23.383 --> 03:44:25.919 region:rollup2
THE PRIVATE.

03:44:23.850 --> 03:44:28.255 region:rollup2
A.

03:44:25.919 --> 03:44:29.823 region:rollup2
PROPRIETARY CODE BICU HIDDEN

03:44:28.255 --> 03:44:30.624 region:rollup2
CODE THE OF.

03:44:29.823 --> 03:44:32.859 region:rollup2
NO PRIVATE VENDORS

03:44:30.624 --> 03:44:34.294 region:rollup2
SO.

03:44:32.859 --> 03:44:36.330 region:rollup2
THAT'S HOW THE STATE WOULD SAVE

03:44:34.294 --> 03:44:38.865 region:rollup2
MONEY IT COULD INVEST SOME MONEY

03:44:36.330 --> 03:44:40.734 region:rollup2
IN. THE DEVELOPMENT OF SAN

03:44:38.865 --> 03:44:43.070 region:rollup2
FRANCISCO AND LA SYSTEMS AND

03:44:40.734 --> 03:44:44.805 region:rollup2
THEN REAP A HUGE HARVEST OF

03:44:43.070 --> 03:44:46.873 region:rollup2
SAVINGS.

03:44:44.805 --> 03:44:48.542 region:rollup2
BY THOSE SYSTEMS BEING MADE

03:44:46.873 --> 03:44:49.977 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE TO THE OTHER COUNTIES.

03:44:48.542 --> 03:44:50.510 region:rollup2
THE OTHER THING I WANT TO TALK

03:44:49.977 --> 03:44:52.279 region:rollup2
ABOUT IS TO RISK LIMITING

03:44:50.510 --> 03:44:55.082 region:rollup2
AUDITS.

03:44:52.279 --> 03:44:56.383 region:rollup2
OF WHICH HAWKING ABOUT THE

03:44:55.082 --> 03:44:58.385 region:rollup2
A PROBLEM WITH THE ONE PERCENT

03:44:56.383 --> 03:45:00.587 region:rollup2
MANUAL TALLY BEING MADE EVEN

03:44:58.385 --> 03:45:03.156 region:rollup2
WEAKER. ONE PERCENT MANUAL TALLY

03:45:00.587 --> 03:45:04.558 region:rollup2
WAS NEVER AN AUDIT.

03:45:03.156 --> 03:45:06.059 region:rollup2
IT WAS SIMPLY TO CHECK ON

03:45:04.558 --> 03:45:07.661 region:rollup2
SOMETHING SEATS IF YOU

03:45:06.059 --> 03:45:09.396 region:rollup2
CONSIDERED AN AUDIT IT WOULD BE

03:45:07.661 --> 03:45:11.298 region:rollup2
AN EXTREMELY WEAK ONE.

03:45:09.396 --> 03:45:13.033 region:rollup2
SOME COUNTIES A DOZEN COUNTIES

03:45:11.298 --> 03:45:15.569 region:rollup2
HAVE ALREADY DONE.

03:45:13.033 --> 03:45:17.004 region:rollup2
A PILOT RISK LIMITING AUDITS

03:45:15.569 --> 03:45:19.740 region:rollup2
ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO WITH DOCTOR

03:45:17.004 --> 03:45:22.476 region:rollup2
PHILIP STARK.

03:45:19.740 --> 03:45:24.745 region:rollup2
OF WHY DON'T WE ALLOW THESE ANY

03:45:22.476 --> 03:45:27.681 region:rollup2
COUNTY WHO WANTS.

03:45:24.745 --> 03:45:29.750 region:rollup2
TO CHECK OUT. INSTEAD OF DOING A

03:45:27.681 --> 03:45:32.352 region:rollup2
ONE PERCENT MANUAL TALLY TO A

03:45:29.750 --> 03:45:33.620 region:rollup2
RISK LIMITING ORDER. THEY COULD

03:45:32.352 --> 03:45:36.757 region:rollup2
EASILY TO THAT FOR ALL THE.

03:45:33.620 --> 03:45:39.493 region:rollup2
GOOD CONTESTS WITHIN COUNTY.

03:45:36.757 --> 03:45:40.427 region:rollup2
ALL THE OLD OLD. OLD OVER RACES

03:45:39.493 --> 03:45:42.262 region:rollup2
WITHIN THE COUNTY THEY COULD

03:45:40.427 --> 03:45:43.764 region:rollup2
EASILY SWITCH FROM DURING THE

03:45:42.262 --> 03:45:45.065 region:rollup2
ONE PERCENT MANUAL TALLY TO RISK

03:45:43.764 --> 03:45:47.901 region:rollup2
LIMITING ORDER.

03:45:45.065 --> 03:45:51.238 region:rollup2
IN THIS NEXT ELECTION WHY WAIT.

03:45:47.901 --> 03:45:52.973 region:rollup2
UNTIL A BILL GOES THROUGH THAT

03:45:51.238 --> 03:45:55.742 region:rollup2
THE CA CEO ENDING LOGANO WORKING

03:45:52.973 --> 03:45:57.177 region:rollup2
ON BECAUSE. THAT WILL.

03:45:55.742 --> 03:45:59.846 region:rollup2
THAT WON'T IT'S A AT THAT ONE

03:45:57.177 --> 03:46:01.715 region:rollup2
GOING TO AFFECT UNTIL NEXT YEAR

03:45:59.846 --> 03:46:03.083 region:rollup2
OR THE YEAR AFTER OR. FOUR YEARS

03:46:01.715 --> 03:46:05.218 region:rollup2
FROM NOW.

03:46:03.083 --> 03:46:07.387 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW SO. UP

HEARING REALLY PUTTING A

03:46:59.639 --> 03:47:02.242 region:rollup2
SPOTLIGHT ON THIS IMPORTANT

03:47:00.207 --> 03:47:02.843 region:rollup2
ISSUE.

03:47:02.242 --> 03:47:04.678 region:rollup2
I THINK ROLL TESTIMONY WE'VE

03:47:02.843 --> 03:47:07.013 region:rollup2
HEARD TODAY TWO MAIN THEMES KIND

03:47:04.678 --> 03:47:07.581 region:rollup2
OF EMERGED TO ME THAT I'VE TAKE

03:47:07.013 --> 03:47:08.215 region:rollup2
COMMON CAUSE STRONGLY AGREES

03:47:07.581 --> 03:47:09.115 region:rollup2
WITH.

03:47:08.215 --> 03:47:10.784 region:rollup2
THE FIRST IS THAT THERE'S NO

03:47:09.115 --> 03:47:11.885 region:rollup2
EVIDENCE OF ANY INTRUSION INTO

03:47:10.784 --> 03:47:13.854 region:rollup2
OUR ELECTION SYSTEMS AND TWENTY

03:47:11.885 --> 03:47:15.355 region:rollup2
SIXTEEN CALIFORNIANS CAN TO

03:47:13.854 --> 03:47:16.756 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO HAVE CONFIDENCE IN

03:47:15.355 --> 03:47:17.958 region:rollup2
THE INTEGRITY OF OUR ELECTIONS.

03:47:16.756 --> 03:47:19.459 region:rollup2
THAT'S REALLY THE MAIN TAKEAWAY

03:47:17.958 --> 03:47:20.660 region:rollup2
AND ONE THAT'S VERY REPORT.

03:47:19.459 --> 03:47:22.028 region:rollup2
THAT SAID THE SECOND TAKE AWAY

03:47:20.660 --> 03:47:23.797 region:rollup2
AS WE ARE CALIFORNIAN WE KNOW WE

03:47:22.028 --> 03:47:25.198 region:rollup2
CAN DO BETTER. AND WE KNOW THAT

03:47:23.797 --> 03:47:25.999 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO DO BETTER BECAUSE

03:47:25.198 --> 03:47:27.200 region:rollup2
THOSE WHO DO WANT TO INTERFERE

03:47:25.999 --> 03:47:28.502 region:rollup2
WITH OUR ELECTIONS THEY'RE GONNA

03:47:27.200 --> 03:47:29.936 region:rollup2
KEEP STRIVING HARDER AND HARDER

03:47:28.502 --> 03:47:30.937 region:rollup2
SAYS IS NOT SOMETHING WHERE WE

03:47:29.936 --> 03:47:32.139 region:rollup2
CAN REST ON OUR LAURELS.

03:47:30.937 --> 03:47:33.273 region:rollup2
INSTINCTS STATIC WE NEED TO KEEP

03:47:32.139 --> 03:47:34.107 region:rollup2
IMPROVING.

03:47:33.273 --> 03:47:35.609 region:rollup2
TWO THINGS THAT I THINK THE

03:47:34.107 --> 03:47:36.142 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE CAN DO THIS YEAR

03:47:35.609 --> 03:47:37.878 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD REALLY HAVE A

03:47:36.142 --> 03:47:39.746 region:rollup2
PROFOUND EFFECT. IS THE FUNDING

03:47:37.878 --> 03:47:41.148 region:rollup2
ISSUE WHICH BEEN TALKED ABOUT OR

03:47:39.746 --> 03:47:42.582 region:rollup2

EXAMINE PROCESS HE'S AND

03:47:49.389 --> 03:47:53.226 region:rollup2
