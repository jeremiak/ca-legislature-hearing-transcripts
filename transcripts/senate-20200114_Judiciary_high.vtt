00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:26.692
VERY VERY EXCITING

00:15:26.759 --> 00:15:29.828
OPPORTUNITIES- BUT- IF YOU

00:15:29.895 --> 00:15:31.530
RECALL FROM JUST ABOUT ANY

00:15:31.597 --> 00:15:33.565
SCIENCE FICTION FILM THAT YOU

00:15:33.632 --> 00:15:36.135
HAVE SEEN THE MIND IN THE

00:15:36.201 --> 00:15:38.737
CAPACITY TO TAKE WHAT MIGHT

00:15:38.804 --> 00:15:40.806
OTHERWISE BE IS FOR GOOD. AND

00:15:40.873 --> 00:15:43.509
TRANSPOSASE INTO NOT SO GOOD OR

00:15:43.575 --> 00:15:46.211
EVEN EVIL ALSO EXIST SO WE ARE

00:15:46.278 --> 00:15:47.913
NOW INTO SORT OF A BRAVE NEW

00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:50.382
WORLD TALKING ABOUT IT HERE IN

00:15:50.449 --> 00:15:52.117
A WAY THAT I ABSOLUTELY AGREE

00:15:52.184 --> 00:15:53.519
TO HELP IMPROVE- PRO PER

00:15:53.585 --> 00:15:55.721
LITIGANTS ARE PARTICULARLY LOW

00:15:55.788 --> 00:15:58.123
INCOME FOLKS WHO HAVE NO ACCESS

00:15:58.190 --> 00:16:01.860
TO LEGAL COUNSEL OUR LEGAL AID

00:16:01.927 --> 00:16:03.329
AS SOCIETIES IN THIS AND

00:16:03.395 --> 00:16:05.464
ASSOCIATIONS ARE MAXED OUT THEY

00:16:05.531 --> 00:16:07.166
DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES THEY

00:16:07.232 --> 00:16:08.200
NEED SO. THIS IS A GREAT

00:16:08.267 --> 00:16:10.369
OPPORTUNITY AND I WANT TO THANK

00:16:10.436 --> 00:16:12.471
THE SENATOR FOR BRINGING THIS

00:16:12.538 --> 00:16:13.872
AND FOR THE COURT TO ALSO

00:16:13.939 --> 00:16:16.175
DEMONSTRATED TO INTEREST IN

00:16:16.241 --> 00:16:20.846
TRYING THIS NEW APPROACH- THE

00:16:20.913 --> 00:16:23.248
AND AS WE HAD DISCUSSED OUR- A

00:16:23.315 --> 00:16:25.017
I HAS TO BE. APPROACH VERY

00:16:25.084 --> 00:16:27.553
METHODICALLY A AND THOUGHTFULLY

00:16:27.619 --> 00:16:28.887
SO I WANT TO THANK THE SENATOR

00:16:28.954 --> 00:16:30.356
FOR AGREEING. TO USE THE

00:16:30.422 --> 00:16:32.658
PARAMETERS AND THE GUIDANCE- IN

00:16:32.725 --> 00:16:34.126
THE GUIDELINES OF THE ASILOMAR

00:16:34.193 --> 00:16:37.463
PRINCIPLES- AGAIN. BECAUSE WE

00:16:37.529 --> 00:16:41.834
ARE- THEN INTO A BRAVE NEW.

00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:43.235
WORLD IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT

00:16:43.302 --> 00:16:44.837
THAT WE SET THESE KINDS OF

00:16:44.903 --> 00:16:47.439
PARAMETERS AS OUR MINIMUM

00:16:47.506 --> 00:16:50.042
EXPECTATIONS AND AGAIN IT'S MY

00:16:50.109 --> 00:16:51.810
HOPE THAT AS WE- ARE A FURTHER

00:16:51.877 --> 00:16:54.146
LOOK AT A AYE WE ADOPT THOSE

00:16:54.213 --> 00:16:57.483
ASILOMAR PRINCIPLES TO THAT-

00:16:57.549 --> 00:16:58.417
RESEARCH IN THAT EFFORT AS

00:16:58.484 --> 00:17:00.886
WELL. BUT THERE'S ALSO

00:17:00.953 --> 00:17:01.887
SOMETHING THAT WE'VE BEEN

00:17:01.954 --> 00:17:04.156
LEARNING ABOUT A I AND ALL

00:17:04.223 --> 00:17:06.325
THESE ALGORITHMS AND THAT'S THE

00:17:06.392 --> 00:17:08.861
NOTION OF IMPLICIT BIAS. WHO'D

00:17:08.927 --> 00:17:11.663
A THUNK BUT THERE IT IS AND WE

00:17:11.730 --> 00:17:13.165
KNOW THAT IT DOES EXIST THEY

00:17:13.232 --> 00:17:14.900
CAN BE BAKED INTO THESE

00:17:14.967 --> 00:17:17.269
TECHNOLOGIES AND SYSTEMS AND-

00:17:17.336 --> 00:17:19.471
THAT'S WHY I THINK CONTINUING

00:17:19.538 --> 00:17:21.807
TRANSPARENCY OVERSIGHT AND

00:17:21.874 --> 00:17:24.076
ACCOUNTABILITY AS WE- START

00:17:24.143 --> 00:17:25.878
MOVING INTO THAT A OUR WORLD

00:17:25.944 --> 00:17:27.012
ARE GOING TO BE CRITICAL TO

00:17:27.079 --> 00:17:28.881
LOOK AT THESE THINGS. TO MAKE

00:17:28.947 --> 00:17:30.949
SURE WE ADDRESS IDENTIFY AND

00:17:31.016 --> 00:17:33.852
ADDRESS IMPLICIT BIAS- AGAIN

00:17:33.919 --> 00:17:36.155
IT'S IMPORTANT TO. TO HAVE FIND

00:17:36.221 --> 00:17:37.756
THESE CREATIVE SOLUTIONS BUT WE

00:17:37.823 --> 00:17:41.627
DON'T WANT TO STREAMLINE ACCESS

00:17:41.693 --> 00:17:43.362
TO THE COURTS FOR INDIGENT

00:17:43.429 --> 00:17:46.031
CALIFORNIANS AT THE EXPENSE OF

00:17:46.098 --> 00:17:47.166
POTENTIALLY INADVERTENTLY

00:17:47.232 --> 00:17:49.301
FURTHER MARGINALIZING THEM. AND

00:17:49.368 --> 00:17:52.771
SO- I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT

00:17:52.838 --> 00:17:55.007
THAT WE ARE IN THAT PROCESS I

00:17:55.073 --> 00:17:57.342
WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO CONTINUE

00:17:57.409 --> 00:17:58.877
DIALOGUING WITH THE JUDICIAL

00:17:58.944 --> 00:18:00.245
COUNCIL IN THE COURTS. TO

00:18:00.312 --> 00:18:02.915
ENSURE THAT ANY LEGISLATION-

00:18:02.981 --> 00:18:05.250
TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION THESE

00:18:05.317 --> 00:18:06.919
OTHER CHALLENGES A COUPLE OF

00:18:06.985 --> 00:18:08.053
WHICH I'VE MENTIONED THERE'S

00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:10.589
ALSO THE CHALLENGE. OF FOR

00:18:10.656 --> 00:18:13.392
EXAMPLE ANY PROPRIETARY RIGHTS

00:18:13.459 --> 00:18:15.060
IN THE SYSTEMS THAT ARE CREATED

00:18:15.127 --> 00:18:16.228
BY THIS HOW WE GONNA DO WITH

00:18:16.295 --> 00:18:18.931
THOSE- AND THE SURROUNDING THE

00:18:18.997 --> 00:18:21.500
UNAUTHORIZED PRACTICE OF LAW.

00:18:21.567 --> 00:18:24.102
WHICH WE HAVE SEEN IN THE FORM

00:18:24.169 --> 00:18:26.738
OF AN ATARI OWES HERE TAKE

00:18:26.805 --> 00:18:29.408
ADVANTAGE OF PARTICULARLY LOW

00:18:29.475 --> 00:18:30.409
INCOME PEOPLE AND DO THEM

00:18:30.476 --> 00:18:33.312
SEVERE CREDITS OKAY WELL THIS

00:18:33.378 --> 00:18:36.181
IS VERY EXCITING. THERE ARE.

00:18:36.248 --> 00:18:38.450
OBSTACLES IN ACTION AND IT IS

00:18:38.517 --> 00:18:40.853
MY HOPE AND I HAVE EVERY

00:18:40.919 --> 00:18:42.521
CONFIDENCE. THIS OFFERING AND

00:18:42.588 --> 00:18:44.456
THE COURTS. WILL TAKE ALL IN.

00:18:44.523 --> 00:18:46.692
THIS WEEK- FORWARD SO I JUST

00:18:46.758 --> 00:18:48.727
WANTED TO BE SURE THAT I FEEL

00:18:48.794 --> 00:18:50.295
THAT WAY BUT ALL IN A AYE STUFF

00:18:50.362 --> 00:18:51.196
THAT WE'RE DOING ARTIFICIAL

00:18:51.263 --> 00:18:52.831
INTELLIGENCE HAS GREAT

00:18:52.898 --> 00:18:54.867
POSSIBILITIES. AND GREAT

00:18:54.933 --> 00:18:58.270
POTENTIAL DOWNSIDE SO THOSE ARE

00:18:58.337 --> 00:19:03.141
MY THOUGHTS AND IF ANYONE ELSE

00:19:03.208 --> 00:19:08.347
HAS A COMMENT SENATOR BORCHERS.

00:19:08.413 --> 00:19:09.848
THANK YOU TO. I WILL WORK AND-

00:19:09.915 --> 00:19:10.816
SENATOR UMBERG FOR OF REMOVING

00:19:10.883 --> 00:19:11.550
THIS FOR- I THINK THIS WOULD BE

00:19:11.617 --> 00:19:13.018
A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO ENGAGE

00:19:13.085 --> 00:19:13.719
FURTHER IN THROUGH THE A AYE-

00:19:13.785 --> 00:19:14.887
SUBCOMMITTEE. BUT I THINK WHEN

00:19:14.953 --> 00:19:17.022
YOU COMPARE WHAT WE ARE DOING

00:19:17.089 --> 00:19:20.692
IS AMERICANS TO WHAT OTHER

00:19:20.759 --> 00:19:21.293
COUNTRIES ARE DOING AROUND THE

00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:23.428
WORLD. WE ARE. WE ARE NOT

00:19:23.495 --> 00:19:25.197
PROGRESSING FAST ENOUGH AND I

00:19:25.264 --> 00:19:27.099
THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT

00:19:27.165 --> 00:19:28.934
STEP. WITH A I AM THIRTIES TO

00:19:29.001 --> 00:19:32.337
BEING. IT'S ALL THE- DATA ENTRY

00:19:32.404 --> 00:19:35.541
IT'S A BASELINE ACCUMULATION OF

00:19:35.607 --> 00:19:36.742
INFORMATION THAT ALLOWS FOR

00:19:36.808 --> 00:19:38.677
PERSPECTIVE USE. AND WE HAVE TO

00:19:38.744 --> 00:19:40.512
START SOMEWHERE AND I THINK

00:19:40.579 --> 00:19:42.681
THAT IS PROBABLY WHERE. YOUR

00:19:42.748 --> 00:19:45.851
PILOT PROGRAMS GOING- I DO KIND

00:19:45.918 --> 00:19:49.688
ONE ECHO- ONE CONCERN- THAT THE

00:19:49.755 --> 00:19:50.289
CHAIR WOMAN WHO IDENTIFIED IS

00:19:50.355 --> 00:19:54.693
THAT. I HOPE THIS DOES NOT GO

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:58.830
IN THE DIRECTION OF. PREDICTIVE

00:19:58.897 --> 00:20:00.465
OUR DECISION MAKING BY THE

00:20:00.532 --> 00:20:02.901
JUDGE AT SOME POINT IN THE

00:20:02.968 --> 00:20:04.303
FUTURE WHETHER WE START LOOKING

00:20:04.369 --> 00:20:08.674
AT. AT THE PAST SENTENCING

00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:10.676
PATTERNS YOU'RE LOOKING A

00:20:10.742 --> 00:20:12.978
PROPENSITY FOR RECIDIVISM ALL

00:20:13.045 --> 00:20:15.547
ALL THAT WOULD BEAR INTO A

00:20:15.614 --> 00:20:16.448
JUDGE'S DECISION MAKING

00:20:16.515 --> 00:20:19.451
PROCESS- I'M I SINCERELY HOPE

00:20:19.518 --> 00:20:22.621
THAT WE DON'T ALLOW IT TO-

00:20:22.688 --> 00:20:24.256
MOVING THAT INTO THAT RANGE

00:20:24.323 --> 00:20:25.324
YOU'RE LOOKING AT IT FROM THE

00:20:25.390 --> 00:20:26.191
OTHER SIDE FROM THE

00:20:26.258 --> 00:20:28.126
ADMINISTRATIVE. SIDE SO WE

00:20:28.193 --> 00:20:29.328
START TALKING ABOUT AUTUMN

00:20:29.394 --> 00:20:31.063
REESER TALKING ABOUT

00:20:31.129 --> 00:20:32.998
NOTIFICATIONS THAT CAN BE GIVEN

00:20:33.065 --> 00:20:35.667
FOR WITNESSES OR FOR PEOPLE TO

00:20:35.734 --> 00:20:40.706
ATTEND COURT- THAT'S OF THOSE

00:20:40.772 --> 00:20:42.708
ARE SIMPLE PATTERNS THAT CAN BE

00:20:42.774 --> 00:20:45.844
THAT THAT CAN BE PUT IN I THINK

00:20:45.911 --> 00:20:46.812
IF WE DO IT AND WE'RE LOOKING

00:20:46.878 --> 00:20:49.247
UPON IT IN THAT FASHION. I

00:20:49.314 --> 00:20:53.318
THINK THIS IS A FANTASTIC. I AM

00:20:53.385 --> 00:20:54.653
I AM UNHAPPY THAT YOU DID NOT

00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:57.255
FRESNO IN YOUR PILOT. AREA BUT

00:20:57.322 --> 00:21:00.926
MAYBE NEXT TIME. THE DISCUSSION

00:21:00.993 --> 00:21:03.061
OF BUT I THINK IF WE CAN SEE IT

00:21:03.128 --> 00:21:05.897
WORKING WELL I THINK WE'VE GOT

00:21:05.964 --> 00:21:06.531
TO IT'S SO ORANGE COUNTY AND IS

00:21:06.598 --> 00:21:09.935
IT ALSO. ALAMEDA COUNTY THROUGH

00:21:10.002 --> 00:21:13.138
A- BUT IF THIS DOES WORK AND I

00:21:13.205 --> 00:21:14.039
EXPECT THAT WE'LL START SEEING

00:21:14.106 --> 00:21:16.141
IT MOVE BEYOND THAT. MY

00:21:16.208 --> 00:21:17.142
UNDERSTANDING IS BECAUSE THE

00:21:17.209 --> 00:21:18.944
COURTS HAVE INDICATED A STRONG

00:21:19.011 --> 00:21:21.213
INTEREST AND THAT THESE LAW

00:21:21.279 --> 00:21:22.881
SCHOOLS HAVE ALSO INTERESTS.

00:21:22.948 --> 00:21:25.617
INDICATED A STRONG INTEREST-

00:21:25.684 --> 00:21:27.686
BUT AGAIN I THINK WE NEED TO

00:21:27.753 --> 00:21:29.287
START SOMEWHERE BUT WE NEED TO

00:21:29.354 --> 00:21:32.290
BE CAUTIOUS WE ARE NOT CHINA-

00:21:32.357 --> 00:21:34.793
WE DON'T WANT THIS INFORMATION.

00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:36.862
OF BEING USED IN WAYS THAT

00:21:36.928 --> 00:21:39.131
MIGHT TONIGHT DEMOCRACY AND THE

00:21:39.197 --> 00:21:41.266
ABILITY PEOPLE TO EXERCISE

00:21:41.333 --> 00:21:43.368
THEIR FREEDOMS. WHICH ARE SO

00:21:43.435 --> 00:21:45.103
IMPORTANT TO US IN THIS COUNTRY

00:21:45.170 --> 00:21:47.472
SO I THINK THIS IS A GOOD. A

00:21:47.539 --> 00:21:49.775
GOOD STEP IN PERHAPS IT WILL

00:21:49.841 --> 00:21:52.577
EXPAND GOING FORWARD. STERN YOU

00:21:52.644 --> 00:21:54.613
HAD TO OF THOUGHT YOUR QUESTION.

00:22:07.893 --> 00:22:08.994
PILE AND FRANKLY THERE'S VERY

00:22:09.061 --> 00:22:10.762
FEW INSTITUTIONS I DRESSED. AS

00:22:10.829 --> 00:22:12.264

OF THIS PROJECT I THINK YOU'VE

00:22:36.221 --> 00:22:37.522
GOT. THE DETENTIONS ALSO

00:22:37.589 --> 00:22:39.191
ENGAGED TO HAVE THAT SORT OF

00:22:39.257 --> 00:22:40.125
PUBLIC INTEREST IN MIND AND ARE

00:22:40.192 --> 00:22:42.294
NOT JUST LOOKING FOR. YOU KNOW

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:44.296
OPTIMIZATIONS OR STREAMLINING

00:22:44.362 --> 00:22:45.230
FOR THE SAKE OF STREAMLINING

00:22:45.297 --> 00:22:47.399

APPROPRIATE TIME I LOVE TO BE

ADDED ON AS A CO AUTHOR THE

00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:57.442
MEASURE- AND I WAS HOPING IT

00:22:57.509 --> 00:22:58.310
DOES HAVE TO BE NOW COULD. IN

00:23:02.948 --> 00:23:05.016
STATE A LITTLE EARLY IN THE-

00:23:05.083 --> 00:23:08.420
THAT IN SCHOOL COULD LOOK LIKE

IN A PRECARIOUS SITUATION

00:33:14.759 --> 00:33:16.160
BECAUSE THE MORAL REASONING

00:33:16.227 --> 00:33:17.362
USED TO JUSTIFY ABORTION IS

00:33:17.428 --> 00:33:20.131
BEING EXPOSED ABORTION IS ONLY

00:33:20.198 --> 00:33:21.733
SURVIVED THIS LONG BECAUSE

00:33:21.799 --> 00:33:25.069
PROPONENTS WERE ABLE TO DECEIVE

00:33:25.136 --> 00:33:25.703
PEOPLE ABOUT THE BRUTAL REALITY

00:33:25.770 --> 00:33:28.172
OF THE PRACTICE. JUST LISTEN TO

00:33:28.239 --> 00:33:29.173
THE WAY THE BOARD IT'S

00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:30.308
ADVOCATES TALK ABOUT THE

00:33:30.375 --> 00:33:31.809
PROCEDURE. DO YOU HEAR THE

00:33:31.876 --> 00:33:34.011
LANGUAGE GYMNASTICS USED TO

00:33:34.078 --> 00:33:36.748
DISTRACT PEOPLE AWAY FROM

00:33:36.814 --> 00:33:37.315
THINKING ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS

00:33:37.382 --> 00:33:39.917
DURING AN ABORTION. WHY DO THEY

00:33:39.984 --> 00:33:43.221
DO THAT. WHY CAN'T THEY TALK

00:33:43.287 --> 00:33:44.355
ABOUT ABORTION IN PLAIN AN

00:33:44.422 --> 00:33:45.723

00:33:48.993 --> 00:33:50.428
PEOPLE FROM THE REALITY OF WAR

00:33:50.495 --> 00:33:51.863
XIN HAS BECOME NEARLY

00:33:51.929 --> 00:33:54.165
IMPOSSIBLE WITH ADVANCES IN

00:33:54.232 --> 00:33:56.834
ULTRASOUND TECHNOLOGY. I HAVE

00:33:56.901 --> 00:33:58.302
THREE KIDS OF MY OWN AND I

00:33:58.369 --> 00:34:00.838
REMEMBER BEING IN FIRST

00:34:00.905 --> 00:34:01.372
INTRODUCED TO MY CHILDREN

00:34:01.439 --> 00:34:03.808
THROUGH THE ULTRASOUND MACHINE.

00:34:03.875 --> 00:34:05.176
I SAW MY DAUGHTER'S HEART

00:34:05.243 --> 00:34:07.178
BEATING IN MY SON'S ARMS AND

AN UNBELIEVABLE EXPERIENCE FOR

00:34:13.317 --> 00:34:15.319
A NEW FATHER. SO WHEN I THINK

00:34:15.386 --> 00:34:17.822
ABOUT WHAT ABORTION IS I RECALL

00:34:17.889 --> 00:34:19.791

DISPROPORTIONATE RATES. WE DO

00:37:11.696 --> 00:37:12.196
NOT SOLVE POVERTY BY KILLING

00:37:12.263 --> 00:37:14.932
POOR CHILDREN. WE HAVE A DREAM

00:37:14.999 --> 00:37:16.834
WHEN WOMEN CAN SUCCEED WITHOUT

00:37:16.901 --> 00:37:18.336
HAVING TO KILL OUR CHILDREN WE

00:37:18.402 --> 00:37:19.503
HAVE A DREAM WHERE WE CAN ALL

00:37:19.570 --> 00:37:21.505
WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE SURE

00:37:21.572 --> 00:37:23.074
WOMEN HAVE THE RESOURCES AND

00:37:23.140 --> 00:37:25.276
SUPPORT WE NEED WHEN FACING THE

00:37:25.343 --> 00:37:26.978
CHALLENGES OF AN UNEXPECTED

00:37:27.044 --> 00:37:30.114
PREGNANCY THE AQ SO THAT SOME

00:37:30.181 --> 00:37:30.615
DAY AS ABORTION BECOMES

00:37:30.681 --> 00:37:31.616
UNTHINKABLE THANK YOU THANK

00:37:31.682 --> 00:37:33.851

TESTIMONY. WITNESSES IN

00:37:36.754 --> 00:37:41.826
OPPOSITION. ALL RIGHT WILL

00:37:41.892 --> 00:37:44.295
BRING IT BACK TO THE DíAS. I

00:37:44.362 --> 00:37:48.499
NOTED THIS. RECOGNITION OF A

00:37:48.566 --> 00:37:49.734
FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOM FOR WOMEN

00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:52.603
CORD FORTY SEVEN YEARS AGO. AND

00:37:52.670 --> 00:37:54.138
I LOOK AROUND THIS ROOM AND

00:37:54.205 --> 00:37:56.207
REALIZED THAT MANY OF THE

00:37:56.273 --> 00:37:57.842
PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM WERE NOT A

00:37:57.908 --> 00:38:00.845
LIFE. BEFORE ROE. AND SO I

00:38:00.911 --> 00:38:03.447
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO SHARE A

00:38:03.514 --> 00:38:04.048
LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT LIFE WAS

00:38:04.115 --> 00:38:08.352
LIKE BEFORE ROE V. WADE. I WAS

00:38:08.419 --> 00:38:08.986
TWENTY THREE SO NOW YOU'LL KNOW

00:38:09.053 --> 00:38:11.689
HOW WILL DIE I'M ABOUT TO BE. A

00:38:11.756 --> 00:38:15.426
WIN ROLE. WAS ACKNOWLEDGED BY

00:38:15.493 --> 00:38:19.163
THE US SUPREME COURT. AND I HAD

00:38:19.230 --> 00:38:22.833
A NUMBER OF FRIENDS WHO I HAD

00:38:22.900 --> 00:38:25.169
TO THE UNEXPECTED UNWANTED

00:38:25.236 --> 00:38:27.004
PREGNANCIES WHO WANTED TO

00:38:27.071 --> 00:38:28.939
TERMINATE THOSE PREGNANCIES

00:38:29.006 --> 00:38:30.274
THEY WERE IN SCHOOL THEY WANTED

00:38:30.341 --> 00:38:31.642
TO CONTINUE GETTING THEIR

00:38:31.709 --> 00:38:33.611
EDUCATION THERE WERE NO

00:38:33.678 --> 00:38:35.146
RESOURCES FOR WOMEN WHO BECAME

00:38:35.212 --> 00:38:38.015
PREGNANT. AT THAT POINT IN TIME

00:38:38.082 --> 00:38:40.117
MANY YOUNGER WOMEN HAD TO LEAVE

00:38:40.184 --> 00:38:44.121
SCHOOL AND ENDED UP IN LIVES TO

00:38:44.188 --> 00:38:46.424
POVERTY WERE LIVES TO SHANE.

00:38:46.490 --> 00:38:48.592
AND SO ROE V. WADE GAVE WOMEN

00:38:48.659 --> 00:38:49.160
AN OPPORTUNITY NOT TRUST TO

00:38:49.226 --> 00:38:52.463
MAKE THEIR OWN. PERSONAL

00:38:52.530 --> 00:38:54.932
CHOICES ABOUT MOTHERHOOD AND

00:38:54.999 --> 00:38:57.835
PARENTHOOD BUT ALSO THE CHOICE

00:38:57.902 --> 00:39:01.105
OF LIFE BECAUSE SO MANY WOMEN

00:39:01.172 --> 00:39:04.375
WHO WERE DESPERATE TO END AN

00:39:04.442 --> 00:39:07.244
UNWANTED PREGNANCY WOULD END UP

00:39:07.311 --> 00:39:09.680
WITH SEPSIS AND DIE. THERE WERE

00:39:09.747 --> 00:39:14.151
WINGS OF HOSPITALS EXCLUSIVELY

00:39:14.218 --> 00:39:16.620
FOR WOMEN WHO HAD TRIED TO SELF

00:39:16.687 --> 00:39:18.723
INDUCE AN ABORTION OR HAD A

00:39:18.789 --> 00:39:21.225
BOTCHED ABORTION DOWN IN MEXICO

00:39:21.292 --> 00:39:22.727
OR BY SOMEONE WHO WAS NOT

00:39:22.793 --> 00:39:24.395
QUALIFIED TO PERFORM THIS

00:39:24.462 --> 00:39:26.597
PROCEDURE WE WERE LOSING

00:39:26.664 --> 00:39:28.699
MOTHERS WITH YOUNG CHILDREN.

00:39:28.766 --> 00:39:31.736
MOTHERS WHO HAD SIX SEVEN EIGHT

00:39:31.802 --> 00:39:33.337
NINE CHILDREN WHO COULD NOT

00:39:33.404 --> 00:39:37.641
AFFORD TO FEED THEIR CHILDREN

00:39:37.708 --> 00:39:38.976
LEAVE THEM AS WAR FRIENDS

00:39:39.043 --> 00:39:41.245
BECAUSE THEY WERE SO DESPERATE

00:39:41.312 --> 00:39:43.647
TO END UP PREGNANT. SO I JUST

00:39:43.714 --> 00:39:46.250
WANT TO REMIND THOSE OF YOU IN

00:39:46.317 --> 00:39:46.817
THIS ROOM WHO WERE NOT HERE

00:39:46.884 --> 00:39:49.954
THEN. THIS WAS A REAL PROBLEM

00:39:50.020 --> 00:39:54.024
ABORTION WILL NOT END. WOMEN

00:39:54.091 --> 00:39:57.061
WANT AND I BELIEVE DIFFERENTLY

00:39:57.128 --> 00:39:59.663
THAN YOU BUT WITH RESPECT THAT

00:39:59.730 --> 00:40:02.833
THIS IS A WOMAN'S CHOICE. AND

00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:04.935
IT IS ONE THAT SHE IS ENTITLED

00:40:05.002 --> 00:40:07.404
TO MAKE WITH HER DOCTOR WITH

00:40:07.471 --> 00:40:09.640
HER FAMILY WITH HER GOD WITH

00:40:09.707 --> 00:40:13.010
WHOM EVER SHE CHOOSES IT IS NOT

00:40:13.077 --> 00:40:15.846
MY RIGHT IT IS NOT YOUR RIGHT

00:40:15.913 --> 00:40:18.616
IT IS THE RIGHT OF EVERY WOMAN.

00:40:18.682 --> 00:40:21.152
AND SO WE ARE HERE NOW FORTY

00:40:21.218 --> 00:40:23.220
SEVEN YEARS LATER WITH ROLE AT

00:40:23.287 --> 00:40:25.055
GREAT RISK BECAUSE IT HAS

00:40:25.122 --> 00:40:27.525
BECOME A POLITICAL FOOTBALL IT

00:40:27.591 --> 00:40:29.827
HAS BECOME A DIVERSION IN THE

00:40:29.894 --> 00:40:31.896
POLITICAL WORLD WHICH IS OF

00:40:31.962 --> 00:40:35.566
GREAT SADNESS TO ME THAT WOMEN

00:40:35.633 --> 00:40:36.133
ARE YET AGAIN THE PINATA OF

00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:38.269
POLITICS. AND I THINK IT'S

00:40:38.335 --> 00:40:40.070
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT AND SO I

00:40:40.137 --> 00:40:41.605
AM VERY PROUD I HAVE CARRIED

00:40:41.672 --> 00:40:43.040
THIS BILL PREVIOUSLY I AM PROUD

00:40:43.107 --> 00:40:45.209
TO BE A CO AUTHOR I THINK WE

00:40:45.276 --> 00:40:46.610
HAVE TO REMEMBER WHO WE ARE

00:40:46.677 --> 00:40:48.946
TALKING ABOUT. AND WE USED TO

00:40:49.013 --> 00:40:50.981
HAVE A SAYING THAT LIFE BEGINS

00:40:51.048 --> 00:40:53.284
AT CONCEPTION AND ENDS AT BIRTH

00:40:53.350 --> 00:40:55.352
BECAUSE THE VERY SAME PEOPLE OR

00:40:55.419 --> 00:40:56.887
I SHOULD SAY MANY OF THOSE SAME

00:40:56.954 --> 00:40:58.689
PEOPLE WHO SAY- BUT THIS IS

00:40:58.756 --> 00:41:01.458
LIFE. ONCE THAT LIFE OCCURS

00:41:01.525 --> 00:41:03.127
THEY ARE UNWILLING TO HELP

00:41:03.194 --> 00:41:05.329
THOSE WHO CANNOT AFFORD TO FEED

00:41:05.396 --> 00:41:07.264
OR CLOTHE OR HOUSE THOSE

00:41:07.331 --> 00:41:09.500
CHILDREN THEY IGNORE THEM. THEY

00:41:09.567 --> 00:41:11.635
SAY THAT IS YOUR PROBLEM THAT

00:41:11.702 --> 00:41:13.270
IS YOUR DESTINY THAT IS YOUR

00:41:13.337 --> 00:41:15.372
RESPONSIBILITY AND SO UNLESS

00:41:15.439 --> 00:41:17.308
AND UNTIL WE HAVE A CONSISTENT

00:41:17.374 --> 00:41:19.243
POSITION ONE THAT ALSO TALKS

00:41:19.310 --> 00:41:22.613
ABOUT THE ABILITY TO MAKE. A

00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:25.616
CONTRACEPTION AVAILABLE BECAUSE

00:41:25.683 --> 00:41:28.953
SEXUAL BEHAVIOR IS ONE OF GOD'S

00:41:29.019 --> 00:41:30.888
WAYS TO PROCREATE THE SPECIES

00:41:30.955 --> 00:41:33.858
AT WHETHER IT'S DONE. IN

00:41:33.924 --> 00:41:34.391
MARRIAGE WHETHER IT'S DONE

00:41:34.458 --> 00:41:37.962
THROUGH A VIOLENT ACT. WE NEED

00:41:38.028 --> 00:41:39.997
TO MAKE SURE THAT MEN HAVE THE

00:41:40.064 --> 00:41:43.267
LADY COME A DECISION ABOUT WHEN

00:41:45.302 --> 00:41:48.005

DECISIONS FOR WOMEN I FEEL AS

TO INCREASED LEGISLATIVE

00:42:46.463 --> 00:42:49.900
EFFORTS TO RESTRICT ACCESS- NOT

00:42:49.967 --> 00:42:51.802
JUST TO ABORTIONS BUT IF I'M

00:42:51.869 --> 00:42:54.371

ACCESS TO FAMILY PLANNING CAN

00:43:03.347 --> 00:43:04.715
ACTUALLY REDUCE THE NUMBER OF

00:43:04.782 --> 00:43:06.383
ABORTIONS- BY REDUCING THE

00:43:06.450 --> 00:43:08.886

TAPPING SAID REVIEWING THE

00:52:33.650 --> 00:52:34.818
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT I'M TRYING

00:52:34.885 --> 00:52:36.019
TO FIGURE OUT HOW THE WORK FROM

THAT NEED TO BE RESOLVED SO

00:52:40.156 --> 00:52:41.558
THAT WE AVOID UNINTENDED

00:52:41.625 --> 00:52:43.960
CONSEQUENCES. UP THE FIRST

00:52:44.027 --> 00:52:44.861
BEING THE OPT OUT WE UNDERSTAND

00:52:44.928 --> 00:52:47.330
THAT THE DESIRE FOR AN OPT OUT

00:52:47.397 --> 00:52:48.532
BUT WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

00:52:48.598 --> 00:52:50.834
FROM OUR LOCAL IT DIRECTORS-

00:52:50.901 --> 00:52:52.235
WHETHER THAT WILL BE A

00:52:52.302 --> 00:52:53.370
CHALLENGE WHETHER THEY'RE OPT

00:52:53.436 --> 00:52:54.704

ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO CREATE

00:52:57.274 --> 00:52:59.342
THOSE CAPABILITIES- BECAUSE WE

00:52:59.409 --> 00:53:00.777

SITUATIONS IN WHICH THERE NEEDS

00:53:16.359 --> 00:53:17.861
TO BE AN EVACUATION WE THINK

00:53:17.928 --> 00:53:20.163

00:53:20.230 --> 00:53:21.231

ABILITY TO OPT OUT OF

DISCLOSING THE INFORMATION. SO

BY GOVERNMENT I KNOW BUT IF FOR

00:56:38.728 --> 00:56:41.531
EXAMPLE EMERGENCY SERVICES.

THAT SOMEONE IS EVACUATED

00:56:48.104 --> 00:56:51.975
THROUGH THE GOING DOOR TO DOOR.

00:56:52.041 --> 00:57:00.283
I UNDERSTAND. THAT'S WHAT YOU

00:57:00.350 --> 00:57:00.917
JUST SO MANY CONSIDERED NO BIG

00:57:00.984 --> 00:57:01.551
DEAL BUT JUST AMERICAN WHETHER

00:57:01.618 --> 00:57:02.619
IT'S A BIG DEAL TO THE EXTENT

00:57:02.685 --> 00:57:03.586
THAT WE WANT TO PROVIDE

00:57:03.653 --> 00:57:06.823
SERVICES SO IN RESPONSE TO THE

00:57:06.890 --> 00:57:07.590
FIRST QUESTION ABOUT AYE HSS

00:57:07.657 --> 00:57:09.459
THEY'VE ALREADY GOT A QUALIFY-

00:57:09.526 --> 00:57:11.861
UNDER THIS BILL AND THE OTHER

00:57:11.928 --> 00:57:13.062
THE OTHER THING AND THIS IS

00:57:13.129 --> 00:57:14.597
MODELED AFTER BILL THAT I'M

00:57:14.664 --> 00:57:15.932
HOPING YOU'LL BE WORKING WITH

00:57:15.999 --> 00:57:17.667
ME ON SEVEN NINETY FOUR WHICH

00:57:17.734 --> 00:57:19.102
IS A RE INTRODUCTION OF A BILL

00:57:19.169 --> 00:57:20.770
THAT I. DID LAST YEAR

00:57:20.837 --> 00:57:22.939
ADDRESSING MAKING SURE THAT

00:57:23.006 --> 00:57:26.075
PEOPLE HAVE THE INFORMATION SO

00:57:26.142 --> 00:57:28.278
THE GOAL IS TO HAVE EVERYBODY

00:57:28.344 --> 00:57:30.713
BE NOTIFIED WHEN THERE IS AN

00:57:30.780 --> 00:57:32.182
EMERGENCY OR WHEN THERE'S A P.

00:57:32.248 --> 00:57:34.851
AT NOW WITH THERE'S A PS PS-

00:57:34.918 --> 00:57:36.686
AND BASICALLY INCLUDING

00:57:36.753 --> 00:57:38.521
EVERYONE UNLESS THEY DON'T WANT

00:57:38.588 --> 00:57:39.689
TO BE INCLUDED IN THE

00:57:39.756 --> 00:57:40.723
INFORMATION GIVING THEM THE

00:57:40.790 --> 00:57:43.059
RIGHT TO OPT OUT SO THAT THEIR

00:57:43.126 --> 00:57:45.094
INFORMATION WILL NOT BE IN THE

00:57:45.161 --> 00:57:47.330
DATABASE THE GOES OUT TO PEOPLE

00:57:47.397 --> 00:57:48.565
OUR HOPE OF COURSE IS THAT

00:57:48.631 --> 00:57:50.500
EVERYBODY WANTS TO BE NOTIFIED

00:57:50.567 --> 00:57:51.467
BUT WE DO HAVE SOME PEOPLE THAT

00:57:51.534 --> 00:57:53.102
WOULD RATHER NOT. AND WHAT THE

00:57:53.169 --> 00:57:55.772
OPT OUT PROVISION IS TO RESPECT

00:57:55.839 --> 00:57:56.840
THE RIGHT OF PEOPLE WHO DO NOT

00:57:56.906 --> 00:57:58.641
WANT TO BE INCLUDED IN THIS

00:57:58.708 --> 00:58:00.977
THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE WON'T TRY

00:58:01.044 --> 00:58:01.778
TO HELP THEM DURING AN

00:58:01.845 --> 00:58:03.580
EMERGENCY JUST MEANS THEY HAVE

00:58:03.646 --> 00:58:05.615
CHOSEN NOT TO BE PART OF THE

00:58:05.682 --> 00:58:08.084
NOTIFICATION SYSTEM WHEN PEOPLE

00:58:08.151 --> 00:58:10.587

REALLY WANT TO BE ABLE TO HELP

00:58:18.661 --> 00:58:20.330
THOSE PEOPLE FIRST BECAUSE

00:58:20.396 --> 00:58:22.932
THEY'RE THE PEOPLE WHO NEED THE

00:58:22.999 --> 00:58:24.000
HELP MOST AND I THAT'S WHAT

00:58:24.067 --> 00:58:26.236

THINK IT'S SEVEN NINETY FOUR

00:58:37.413 --> 00:58:41.117
WHICH IS A BILL I RE INTRODUCED

00:58:41.184 --> 00:58:42.685
