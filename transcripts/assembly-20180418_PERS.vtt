01:14:19.555 --> 01:14:24.226 region:rollup2
LOOPHOLE FOR OUR OWN MEMBERS.

01:14:22.925 --> 01:14:25.761 region:rollup2
THIS INSTITUTION WAS ROCKED LAST

01:14:24.226 --> 01:14:27.296 region:rollup2
YEAR.

01:14:25.761 --> 01:14:29.298 region:rollup2
BY SCANDAL.

01:14:27.296 --> 01:14:30.566 region:rollup2
AFTER SCANDAL.

01:14:29.298 --> 01:14:32.868 region:rollup2
OF ALLEGATIONS OF SEXUAL

01:14:30.566 --> 01:14:34.670 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT AND RETALIATION.

01:14:32.868 --> 01:14:36.205 region:rollup2
WE PACKED PAST ABUSES ABOUT

01:14:34.670 --> 01:14:38.541 region:rollup2
WORKPLACE BULLYING AND WE'VE

01:14:36.205 --> 01:14:40.743 region:rollup2
FOUND LIKE ANY WORKPLACE.

01:14:38.541 --> 01:14:42.712 region:rollup2
WHERE THERE IS?

01:14:40.743 --> 01:14:45.381 region:rollup2
AN IMBALANCE OF POWER.

01:14:42.712 --> 01:14:47.116 region:rollup2
THAT WORKERS HAVE NO RECOURSE.

01:14:45.381 --> 01:14:48.384 region:rollup2
THAT THEY HAVE NO ABILITY TO

01:14:47.116 --> 01:14:50.052 region:rollup2
COME FORWARD IN A SAFE

01:14:48.384 --> 01:14:51.120 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENT.

01:14:50.052 --> 01:14:52.888 region:rollup2
TO WORK TOGETHER TO CHANGE THEIR

01:14:51.120 --> 01:14:54.457 region:rollup2
WORKPLACE.

01:14:52.888 --> 01:14:55.691 region:rollup2
OFTEN PEOPLE THINK ABOUT THE

01:14:54.457 --> 01:14:57.493 region:rollup2
RIGHT TO UNIONIZE IN TERMS

01:14:55.691 --> 01:14:59.895 region:rollup2
A PAY AND BENEFITS.

01:14:57.493 --> 01:15:00.930 region:rollup2
I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE THIS.

01:14:59.895 --> 01:15:02.298 region:rollup2
BUILDING WOULD AGREE THAT THEIR

01:15:00.930 --> 01:15:04.533 region:rollup2
BENEFITS.

01:15:02.298 --> 01:15:05.768 region:rollup2
ARE QUITE GOOD.

01:15:04.533 --> 01:15:06.302 region:rollup2
HAVING COVER LABOR MOVEMENT I

01:15:05.768 --> 01:15:08.070 region:rollup2
DON'T THINK I'VE SEEN MUCH

01:15:06.302 --> 01:15:09.138 region:rollup2
BETTER.

01:15:08.070 --> 01:15:10.973 region:rollup2
THE PROBLEMS WITH PAYING WE'VE

01:15:09.138 --> 01:15:13.275 region:rollup2
KNOWN THAT WE'VE TAKEN SOME

01:15:10.973 --> 01:15:15.511 region:rollup2
STEPS TO ADDRESS PAY INEQUITIES

01:15:13.275 --> 01:15:17.680 region:rollup2
BUT THERE'S STILL PROBLEMS.

01:15:15.511 --> 01:15:18.914 region:rollup2
AND IT'S THERE'S NO UNIFORMITY

01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:20.516 region:rollup2
THERE'S NO RIGHTS FOR ANY

01:15:18.914 --> 01:15:21.484 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL WORKER. THERE SOME

01:15:20.516 --> 01:15:22.551 region:rollup2
RULES THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE

01:15:21.484 --> 01:15:24.520 region:rollup2
APPLIED.

01:15:22.551 --> 01:15:27.390 region:rollup2
AND AS A RESULT IT'S.

01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:29.158 region:rollup2
SLIGHTLY UNFAIR.

01:15:27.390 --> 01:15:30.459 region:rollup2
BUT WHAT'S MOST STRIKING.

01:15:29.158 --> 01:15:32.028 region:rollup2
IF THERE'S A WORKPLACE CULTURE

01:15:30.459 --> 01:15:33.996 region:rollup2
THAT DOESN'T ALLOW THE VERY

01:15:32.028 --> 01:15:35.297 region:rollup2
WORKERS WHO ALLOW US TO DO OUR

01:15:33.996 --> 01:15:37.533 region:rollup2
JOB.

01:15:35.297 --> 01:15:39.468 region:rollup2
WHO REALLY ARE THE BACKBONE OF

01:15:37.533 --> 01:15:40.636 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING WE DO? FOR THEM TO

01:15:39.468 --> 01:15:43.005 region:rollup2
HAVE A VOICE IN THEIR OWN

01:15:40.636 --> 01:15:44.206 region:rollup2
WORKPLACE.

01:15:43.005 --> 01:15:45.608 region:rollup2
FOR THEM TO COME UP WITH

01:15:44.206 --> 01:15:48.077 region:rollup2
SOLUTIONS TO PROBLEMS THAT THEY

01:15:45.608 --> 01:15:49.812 region:rollup2
SEE THAT EXIST.

01:15:48.077 --> 01:15:51.480 region:rollup2
I APPLAUD THE EFFORTS OF THE

01:15:49.812 --> 01:15:53.349 region:rollup2
SPEAKER IN THE PRO TEM AND THE

01:15:51.480 --> 01:15:54.650 region:rollup2
EFFORTS OF MEMBERS OF THIS BODY

01:15:53.349 --> 01:15:56.786 region:rollup2
TO COME TOGETHER AND HAVE A

01:15:54.650 --> 01:15:58.187 region:rollup2
JOINT COMMITTEE. TO ADDRESS SOME

01:15:56.786 --> 01:15:59.922 region:rollup2
OF THE ISSUES WE'VE SEEN.

01:15:58.187 --> 01:16:01.657 region:rollup2
BUT LET'S BE HONEST

01:15:59.922 --> 01:16:02.992 region:rollup2
AND ANY OTHER WORKPLACE

01:16:01.657 --> 01:16:05.661 region:rollup2
THAT WILL BE THE BOSS IS COMING

01:16:02.992 --> 01:16:06.962 region:rollup2
TOGETHER WITH OUTSIDE EXPERTS.

01:16:05.661 --> 01:16:08.297 region:rollup2
TO TELL THE PEOPLE WHO ARE

01:16:06.962 --> 01:16:09.732 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY FACING THESE ISSUES

01:16:08.297 --> 01:16:11.133 region:rollup2
WHAT IS RIGHT AND WHAT WHAT WILL

01:16:09.732 --> 01:16:13.135 region:rollup2
CORRECT

01:16:11.133 --> 01:16:15.538 region:rollup2
CULTURE FOR THEM.

01:16:13.135 --> 01:16:17.540 region:rollup2
THERE IS NO SUBSTANTIVE INPUT BY

01:16:15.538 --> 01:16:18.641 region:rollup2
THE VERY PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE

01:16:17.540 --> 01:16:20.376 region:rollup2
PROBLEMS THAT HAVE VOICED THEIR

01:16:18.641 --> 01:16:20.976 region:rollup2
CONCERNS.

01:16:20.376 --> 01:16:23.179 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHAT IS GOING ON IN THIS

01:16:20.976 --> 01:16:25.081 region:rollup2
BUILDING.

01:16:23.179 --> 01:16:27.083 region:rollup2
ONE WAY TO SOLVE THAT IN FACT

01:16:25.081 --> 01:16:29.218 region:rollup2
THE ONLY WAY I'VE EVER SEEN IN

01:16:27.083 --> 01:16:31.153 region:rollup2
ANY WORKPLACE TO SOLVE THAT.

01:16:29.218 --> 01:16:31.887 region:rollup2
IS TO ALLOW WORKERS THE CHANCE.

01:16:31.153 --> 01:16:34.323 region:rollup2
TO COME TOGETHER AND HAVE A

01:16:31.887 --> 01:16:36.459 region:rollup2
COLLECTIVE VOICE.

01:16:34.323 --> 01:16:38.694 region:rollup2
THIS BILL DOESN'T SAY THAT ANY

01:16:36.459 --> 01:16:40.663 region:rollup2
MEMBER OF ANYBODY STAFF WILL BE

01:16:38.694 --> 01:16:42.865 region:rollup2
IN A UNION.

01:16:40.663 --> 01:16:43.365 region:rollup2
THAT IS A RIGHT THAT SHOULD AND

01:16:42.865 --> 01:16:46.669 region:rollup2
WOULD ST WITH THE ACTUAL

01:16:43.365 --> 01:16:48.771 region:rollup2
WORKERS.

01:16:46.669 --> 01:16:51.474 region:rollup2
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE DEMAND

01:16:48.771 --> 01:16:53.442 region:rollup2
OF EVERY OTHER EMPLOYER.

01:16:51.474 --> 01:16:55.411 region:rollup2
WHAT THIS BILL DOES SIMPLY IS

01:16:53.442 --> 01:16:56.612 region:rollup2
NOT ONLY FOR OUR STAFF?

01:16:55.411 --> 01:16:58.481 region:rollup2
TELL THEM THAT WE RESPECT THEM

01:16:56.612 --> 01:17:00.483 region:rollup2
ENOUGH TO MAKE THAT CHOICE ON

01:16:58.481 --> 01:17:02.718 region:rollup2
THEIR OWN WITH OUT INTIMIDATION

01:17:00.483 --> 01:17:04.253 region:rollup2
AND WITHOUT RETALIATION.

01:17:02.718 --> 01:17:05.754 region:rollup2
BUT ALSO FOR THAT OTHER STAFF

01:17:04.253 --> 01:17:06.789 region:rollup2
THAT ARE NOT OUR DIRECT STAFF

01:17:05.754 --> 01:17:08.357 region:rollup2
WHO MAY ALSO HELP WORKPLACE

01:17:06.789 --> 01:17:09.358 region:rollup2
GRIPES.

01:17:08.357 --> 01:17:11.527 region:rollup2
WHETHER IT'S THE SERGEANTS TO

01:17:09.358 --> 01:17:12.361 region:rollup2
DRIVE US AROUND WHETHER IT'S THE

01:17:11.527 --> 01:17:13.796 region:rollup2
FOLKS WHO ARE WORKING IN THE

01:17:12.361 --> 01:17:15.598 region:rollup2
CLERK'S OFFICE TO PROCESS OUR

01:17:13.796 --> 01:17:18.067 region:rollup2
BILLS WHETHER IT'S ALLEGE

01:17:15.598 --> 01:17:20.503 region:rollup2
COUNSEL WHO WRITE OUR BILLS.

01:17:18.067 --> 01:17:22.471 region:rollup2
IT IS JUST A SIMPLE STATEMENT OF

01:17:20.503 --> 01:17:25.174 region:rollup2
ALLOWING WORKERS.

01:17:22.471 --> 01:17:27.142 region:rollup2
DOT RIGHT TO HAVE A VOICE IN TO

01:17:25.174 --> 01:17:29.278 region:rollup2
SAY WE RESPECT THEM ENOUGH TO

01:17:27.142 --> 01:17:32.114 region:rollup2
USE THAT VOICE RESPONSIBLY.

01:17:29.278 --> 01:17:33.849 region:rollup2
IF THEY SO CHOOSE.

01:17:32.114 --> 01:17:36.151 region:rollup2
THAT'S ALL THIS BILL DOES

01:17:33.849 --> 01:17:38.053 region:rollup2
I KNOW IT SCARES PEOPLE.

01:17:36.151 --> 01:17:40.456 region:rollup2
I'VE HAD VERY LITTLE HONEST

01:17:38.053 --> 01:17:42.124 region:rollup2
INTERACTION WITH ANYBODY ABOUT

01:17:40.456 --> 01:17:43.592 region:rollup2
THE OPPOSITION ALTHOUGH I KNOW

01:17:42.124 --> 01:17:45.995 region:rollup2
IT EXIST. ONLY.

01:17:43.592 --> 01:17:47.663 region:rollup2
AMONG THEIR OWN RANKS.

01:17:45.995 --> 01:17:50.132 region:rollup2
IF A MEMBER WOULD LIKE TO COME

01:17:47.663 --> 01:17:52.668 region:rollup2
FORWARD IN SUGGESTS TO ME LIKE

01:17:50.132 --> 01:17:53.736 region:rollup2
ANY OTHER PROCESS SUGGESTED AS.

01:17:52.668 --> 01:17:55.471 region:rollup2
AT LEAST ONE MEMBER HAS THAT

01:17:53.736 --> 01:17:56.305 region:rollup2
WERE UNIQUE.

01:17:55.471 --> 01:17:58.173 region:rollup2
WHERE SPECIAL?

01:17:56.305 --> 01:17:59.642 region:rollup2
WHAT DIFFERENT

01:17:58.173 --> 01:18:01.577 region:rollup2
WE DON'T NEED?

01:17:59.642 --> 01:18:03.012 region:rollup2
A UNION IN THIS WORKPLACE.

01:18:01.577 --> 01:18:05.214 region:rollup2
I CHALLENGE YOU TO SAY THAT

01:18:03.012 --> 01:18:06.048 region:rollup2
PUBLIC BECAUSE EVERY BOSS THINKS

01:18:05.214 --> 01:18:07.983 region:rollup2
THEY DON'T NEED A UNION IN THE

01:18:06.048 --> 01:18:09.585 region:rollup2
WORKPLACE.

01:18:07.983 --> 01:18:10.920 region:rollup2

01:30:11.006 --> 01:30:13.642 region:rollup2

01:31:13.435 --> 01:31:16.738 region:rollup2
I DO NOT HAVE A RECOMMENDATION

01:31:15.203 --> 01:31:18.006 region:rollup2

CALPERS WOULD HAVE.

01:52:49.363 --> 01:52:52.199 region:rollup2
THINK GIVEN THE JPA THE OPTION

AMEND THE CONTRACT WITH GPA.

01:52:59.973 --> 01:53:02.776 region:rollup2
THEY DON'T HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO

01:53:06.413 --> 01:53:09.182 region:rollup2
I THE JPA WOULD THEN BE ON THE

HOOK FOR THE IMMEDIATE PAYMENT

01:53:09.182 --> 01:53:12.419 region:rollup2

DISSOLVED.

01:53:18.458 --> 01:53:20.794 region:rollup2
THEN CALPERS AS A RESULT OF THIS

01:53:19.393 --> 01:53:22.062 region:rollup2
LEGISLATION WOULD HAVE NO

01:53:20.794 --> 01:53:23.063 region:rollup2
ALTERNATIVE BUT TO TERMINATE THE

WERE NOT THEIRS.

01:53:38.512 --> 01:53:43.216 region:rollup2
THE OUTCOME IS THE EXACT SAME

01:53:41.214 --> 01:53:45.252 region:rollup2
ONLY CALPERS HAS LESS OPTIONS

01:53:43.216 --> 01:53:46.853 region:rollup2

01:53:54.394 --> 01:53:57.898 region:rollup2
THIS BILL PUTS THEIR PENSIONS AT

01:53:56.129 --> 01:53:59.700 region:rollup2
GREATER RISK.

01:53:57.898 --> 01:54:01.201 region:rollup2
WHEN MEMBER AGENCIES WERE NEVER
