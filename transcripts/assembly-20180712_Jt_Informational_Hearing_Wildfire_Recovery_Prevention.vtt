a whole lot of other things --

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:48.235 region:rollup3
Just to it for life in general

00:02:44.665 --> 00:02:50.704 region:rollup3

00:02:46.466 --> 00:02:51.104 region:rollup3
Here in our community where --

00:02:48.235 --> 00:02:52.773 region:rollup3

extraordinary --

00:02:51.104 --> 00:02:55.008 region:rollup3

so.

00:03:35.082 --> 00:03:42.889 region:rollup3
The districts are only about a

00:03:38.585 --> 00:03:44.725 region:rollup3
hundred and every amber that

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:46.827 region:rollup3
fire.

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:48.728 region:rollup3
Other Tom aspirant every

00:03:44.725 --> 00:03:50.430 region:rollup3
incident we've had in this area

00:03:46.827 --> 00:03:52.632 region:rollup3
is in not only the nineteen

00:03:48.728 --> 00:03:54.401 region:rollup3
Senate district but the thirty

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:55.068 region:rollup3
seventh the simply districts so.

00:03:52.632 --> 00:03:56.570 region:rollup3
My culture assembly member

00:03:54.401 --> 00:03:58.805 region:rollup3
Monique cling we moan and I are

00:03:55.068 --> 00:03:59.439 region:rollup3
joined at the hip.

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:00.807 region:rollup3
Literally and figuratively up

00:03:58.805 --> 00:04:02.976 region:rollup3
and I was thinking the other day

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:04.644 region:rollup3
--

00:04:00.807 --> 00:04:06.480 region:rollup3
Our first bonding moment came

00:04:02.976 --> 00:04:08.682 region:rollup3
during the time we're having

00:04:04.644 --> 00:04:10.550 region:rollup3
those terrible range --

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:12.552 region:rollup3
And we both needed to be here so

00:04:08.682 --> 00:04:14.554 region:rollup3
we rented a truck.

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:14.788 region:rollup3
And drove down from Sacramento

00:04:12.552 --> 00:04:16.590 region:rollup3
think it took nine and a half

00:04:14.554 --> 00:04:18.825 region:rollup3
hours.

00:04:14.788 --> 00:04:19.392 region:rollup3
And we wish we were.

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.594 region:rollup3
Stupid to do this C. it was a

00:04:18.825 --> 00:04:22.729 region:rollup3
very dangerous trip but we

00:04:19.392 --> 00:04:24.898 region:rollup3
needed to get home and and of

00:04:20.594 --> 00:04:28.969 region:rollup3
course we've been --

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:30.704 region:rollup3
Side by side during the Thomas

00:04:24.898 --> 00:04:30.971 region:rollup3
fire and we're so we're going to

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:32.539 region:rollup3
brief when.

00:04:30.704 --> 00:04:34.574 region:rollup3
C. are --

00:04:30.971 --> 00:04:35.142 region:rollup3
Holiday fire so --

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:36.610 region:rollup3
It's it's an honor for me to be

00:04:34.574 --> 00:04:38.578 region:rollup3
able to share the stage with

00:04:35.142 --> 00:04:39.179 region:rollup3
her.

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.881 region:rollup3
And Dodd to be your your state

00:04:38.578 --> 00:04:42.983 region:rollup3
senator I know we've all been

00:04:39.179 --> 00:04:45.051 region:rollup3
through a lot [inaudible]

00:04:40.881 --> 00:04:46.987 region:rollup3
And hopefully we are moving out

00:04:42.983 --> 00:04:48.622 region:rollup3
of it but the the fire that we

00:04:45.051 --> 00:04:50.724 region:rollup3
had last week in his reminder

00:04:46.987 --> 00:04:52.626 region:rollup3
that we must always be vigilant.

00:04:48.622 --> 00:04:52.826 region:rollup3
That -- We

00:04:50.724 --> 00:04:54.928 region:rollup3
are.

00:04:52.626 --> 00:04:57.130 region:rollup3
Only.

00:04:52.826 --> 00:04:59.065 region:rollup3
Get a bit a lot away from having

00:04:54.928 --> 00:05:02.536 region:rollup3
events that are again going to

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:02.903 region:rollup3
challenge our our community but

00:04:59.065 --> 00:05:04.504 region:rollup3
we have a spirit here.

00:05:02.536 --> 00:05:06.973 region:rollup3
Are members --

00:05:02.903 --> 00:05:08.475 region:rollup3
Being here about six months ago

00:05:04.504 --> 00:05:10.844 region:rollup3
people who had just been through

00:05:06.973 --> 00:05:12.579 region:rollup3
the debris flow --

00:05:08.475 --> 00:05:14.881 region:rollup3
And seeing us come together

00:05:10.844 --> 00:05:16.850 region:rollup3
really is inspiring --

00:05:12.579 --> 00:05:18.685 region:rollup3
And we have and we will continue

00:05:14.881 --> 00:05:19.286 region:rollup3
to do so as we all have our

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:21.087 region:rollup3
hearing today --

00:05:18.685 --> 00:05:22.923 region:rollup3
We've entitled a vision for

00:05:19.286 --> 00:05:24.558 region:rollup3
Santa Barbara recovery and

00:05:21.087 --> 00:05:26.593 region:rollup3
rebuild evaluating where we are

00:05:22.923 --> 00:05:28.562 region:rollup3
now.

00:05:24.558 --> 00:05:30.797 region:rollup3
The long term plan for

00:05:26.593 --> 00:05:32.966 region:rollup3
revitalizing our community.

00:05:28.562 --> 00:05:35.068 region:rollup3
And ensuring continued effective

00:05:30.797 --> 00:05:35.669 region:rollup3
collaboration going forward for

00:05:32.966 --> 00:05:36.503 region:rollup3
whatever the challenges are in

00:05:35.068 --> 00:05:38.805 region:rollup3
the disasters that may befall

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:40.774 region:rollup3
us.

00:05:36.503 --> 00:05:42.809 region:rollup3
Being strong togethers community

00:05:38.805 --> 00:05:46.680 region:rollup3
working with our public

00:05:40.774 --> 00:05:48.849 region:rollup3
officials in our community --

00:05:42.809 --> 00:05:50.817 region:rollup3
We will continue to overcome and

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:51.351 region:rollup3
the strength and a by the

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:52.819 region:rollup3
lessons that we learned.

00:05:50.817 --> 00:05:54.988 region:rollup3
So the purpose of today's

00:05:51.351 --> 00:05:56.623 region:rollup3
hearing is to assemble key

00:05:52.819 --> 00:05:58.758 region:rollup3
leaders from both the local and

00:05:54.988 --> 00:05:59.426 region:rollup3
state level.

00:05:56.623 --> 00:06:00.727 region:rollup3
A to update this community on

00:05:58.758 --> 00:06:03.230 region:rollup3
the efforts that are being taken

00:05:59.426 --> 00:06:04.865 region:rollup3
in both Sacramento.

00:06:00.727 --> 00:06:08.935 region:rollup3
And of Santa Barbara for the

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:13.073 region:rollup3
long term rebuilding and

00:06:04.865 --> 00:06:14.541 region:rollup3
revitalization of the county.

00:06:08.935 --> 00:06:16.743 region:rollup3
Of Monning and of I think that.

00:06:13.073 --> 00:06:18.745 region:rollup3
By the fact we're here.

00:06:14.541 --> 00:06:20.714 region:rollup3
We had an incident last Friday

00:06:16.743 --> 00:06:21.381 region:rollup3
our discussions about.

00:06:18.745 --> 00:06:22.782 region:rollup3
Doing something that seemed

00:06:20.714 --> 00:06:26.519 region:rollup3
appropriate after six months who

00:06:21.381 --> 00:06:28.889 region:rollup3
made even more important --

00:06:22.782 --> 00:06:30.891 region:rollup3
By this fired this past weekend

00:06:26.519 --> 00:06:31.191 region:rollup3
which sadly took thirteen homes

00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:33.126 region:rollup3
and a number of additional

00:06:30.891 --> 00:06:34.961 region:rollup3
buildings.

00:06:31.191 --> 00:06:36.897 region:rollup3
But with a without the loss of

00:06:33.126 --> 00:06:37.297 region:rollup3
life and that of course is

00:06:34.961 --> 00:06:37.864 region:rollup3
always the critical and most

00:06:36.897 --> 00:06:40.567 region:rollup3
important thing.

00:06:37.297 --> 00:06:43.036 region:rollup3
And the fact that we up that

00:06:37.864 --> 00:06:44.904 region:rollup3
are.

00:06:40.567 --> 00:06:47.073 region:rollup3
Public safety or fire department

00:06:43.036 --> 00:06:48.942 region:rollup3
Skinner with lessons learned

00:06:44.904 --> 00:06:49.576 region:rollup3
they knew it with a red flag

00:06:47.073 --> 00:06:50.677 region:rollup3
warning that there was a real

00:06:48.942 --> 00:06:51.278 region:rollup3
potential for fire and there's

00:06:49.576 --> 00:06:54.981 region:rollup3
no doubt.

00:06:50.677 --> 00:06:55.615 region:rollup3
That having these fire trucks

00:06:51.278 --> 00:06:56.916 region:rollup3
from other parts of the state or

00:06:54.981 --> 00:07:00.687 region:rollup3
local folks everybody all hands

00:06:55.615 --> 00:07:02.989 region:rollup3
on deck.

00:06:56.916 --> 00:07:03.423 region:rollup3
Kept that far from getting worse

00:07:00.687 --> 00:07:05.191 region:rollup3
than than it was in and then it

00:07:02.989 --> 00:07:06.927 region:rollup3
could have been so.

00:07:03.423 --> 00:07:08.995 region:rollup3
With nine far out thousand

00:07:05.191 --> 00:07:10.864 region:rollup3
wildfires ignited across all

00:07:06.927 --> 00:07:13.166 region:rollup3
parts of the strip state last

00:07:08.995 --> 00:07:15.201 region:rollup3
year which was no worse fire --

00:07:10.864 --> 00:07:16.670 region:rollup3
Wildfire year we've had this

00:07:13.166 --> 00:07:18.772 region:rollup3
year looks like it's going to be

00:07:15.201 --> 00:07:21.207 region:rollup3
as bad if not worse --

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:23.276 region:rollup3
We burned over --

00:07:18.772 --> 00:07:23.810 region:rollup3
Half a million acres of land

00:07:21.207 --> 00:07:24.544 region:rollup3
last year destroyed more than

00:07:23.276 --> 00:07:27.414 region:rollup3
ten thousand eight hundred

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:28.682 region:rollup3
structures.

00:07:24.544 --> 00:07:31.184 region:rollup3
And claimed the lives of seventy

00:07:27.414 --> 00:07:33.086 region:rollup3
one people --

00:07:28.682 --> 00:07:35.188 region:rollup3
And we of course here in in this

00:07:31.184 --> 00:07:36.990 region:rollup3
county were among the most

00:07:33.086 --> 00:07:38.959 region:rollup3
impacted their communities in

00:07:35.188 --> 00:07:39.459 region:rollup3
the state first with the Thomas

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:40.894 region:rollup3
fire which also.

00:07:38.959 --> 00:07:43.063 region:rollup3
Impacted our friends and

00:07:39.459 --> 00:07:44.764 region:rollup3
colleagues in Ventura --

00:07:40.894 --> 00:07:46.733 region:rollup3
Took out about five hundred

00:07:43.063 --> 00:07:47.367 region:rollup3
eighty six homes in.

00:07:44.764 --> 00:07:50.837 region:rollup3
One strip of fought area in

00:07:46.733 --> 00:07:51.338 region:rollup3
Ventura took out homes in the

00:07:47.367 --> 00:07:53.006 region:rollup3
Ohio valley --

00:07:50.837 --> 00:07:54.641 region:rollup3
And then of course --

00:07:51.338 --> 00:07:56.843 region:rollup3
Damaged --

00:07:53.006 --> 00:08:00.680 region:rollup3
About a thousand homes when we

00:07:54.641 --> 00:08:02.782 region:rollup3
the debris flow --

00:07:56.843 --> 00:08:04.784 region:rollup3
We've had our share of problems

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:05.452 region:rollup3
so -- We're

00:08:02.782 --> 00:08:08.888 region:rollup3
here today to talk about --

00:08:04.784 --> 00:08:10.790 region:rollup3
Where we are in terms of that

00:08:05.452 --> 00:08:11.424 region:rollup3
rebuilt our resiliency what

00:08:08.888 --> 00:08:12.726 region:rollup3
we're gonna do going forward the

00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:14.761 region:rollup3
county has been gracious enough

00:08:11.424 --> 00:08:15.295 region:rollup3
to give?

00:08:12.726 --> 00:08:17.097 region:rollup3
It's their time to be here in

00:08:14.761 --> 00:08:18.932 region:rollup3
the state we also have.

00:08:15.295 --> 00:08:20.834 region:rollup3
A a number of people

00:08:17.097 --> 00:08:21.501 region:rollup3
representing the state of who

00:08:18.932 --> 00:08:23.036 region:rollup3
are with us.

00:08:20.834 --> 00:08:25.238 region:rollup3
You know the frequency of these

00:08:21.501 --> 00:08:26.840 region:rollup3
natural disasters reflects would

00:08:23.036 --> 00:08:28.842 region:rollup3
get a brown and others have been

00:08:25.238 --> 00:08:31.177 region:rollup3
talking about is the new normal.

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:32.812 region:rollup3
Climate change is real.

00:08:28.842 --> 00:08:34.981 region:rollup3
And does the fact that we have

00:08:31.177 --> 00:08:36.850 region:rollup3
gone through years of drought

00:08:32.812 --> 00:08:38.818 region:rollup3
that our weather fans have been

00:08:34.981 --> 00:08:39.486 region:rollup3
so much more dramatic whether

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:42.922 region:rollup3
it's here in California through

00:08:38.818 --> 00:08:44.924 region:rollup3
or around the country or world.

00:08:39.486 --> 00:08:46.860 region:rollup3
A we have we saw when we had

00:08:42.922 --> 00:08:48.795 region:rollup3
that debris flow the humidity --

00:08:44.924 --> 00:08:51.097 region:rollup3
During the fire rather in and as

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:53.199 region:rollup3
said to be flow was --

00:08:48.795 --> 00:08:55.101 region:rollup3
Creating a the lowest humidity

00:08:51.097 --> 00:08:55.702 region:rollup3
rates that's why the fire burned

00:08:53.199 --> 00:08:56.069 region:rollup3
as it did it when it started it

00:08:55.101 --> 00:08:58.671 region:rollup3
was burning at the rate of an

00:08:55.702 --> 00:09:00.974 region:rollup3
acre [inaudible]

00:08:56.069 --> 00:09:01.674 region:rollup3
Second.

00:08:58.671 --> 00:09:02.275 region:rollup3
Think about that acre a set.

00:09:00.974 --> 00:09:04.878 region:rollup3
And the night of the debris flow

00:09:01.674 --> 00:09:05.512 region:rollup3
because we have pre positioned

00:09:02.275 --> 00:09:08.915 region:rollup3
--

00:09:04.878 --> 00:09:09.582 region:rollup3
So many of our public safety

00:09:05.512 --> 00:09:10.717 region:rollup3
people nine hundred people.

00:09:08.915 --> 00:09:12.819 region:rollup3
Out were saved the night of the

00:09:09.582 --> 00:09:14.888 region:rollup3
debris flow.

00:09:10.717 --> 00:09:15.455 region:rollup3
So we lost.

00:09:12.819 --> 00:09:17.390 region:rollup3
Twenty three there were nine

00:09:14.888 --> 00:09:18.925 region:rollup3
hundred other people who are

00:09:15.455 --> 00:09:21.061 region:rollup3
sick because of the work that

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:22.962 region:rollup3
was done in anticipation.

00:09:18.925 --> 00:09:24.931 region:rollup3
Of this potential problem we

00:09:21.061 --> 00:09:27.133 region:rollup3
have to maintain that vigilance

00:09:22.962 --> 00:09:28.968 region:rollup3
and I am confident that.

00:09:24.931 --> 00:09:30.703 region:rollup3
With your help with the help of

00:09:27.133 --> 00:09:31.304 region:rollup3
the experts who are here and

00:09:28.968 --> 00:09:33.273 region:rollup3
good government and that really

00:09:30.703 --> 00:09:35.375 region:rollup3
is this is government at its

00:09:31.304 --> 00:09:39.078 region:rollup3
finest people coming together.

00:09:33.273 --> 00:09:39.546 region:rollup3
Recognizing the challenges that

00:09:35.375 --> 00:09:40.947 region:rollup3
we have and working out together

00:09:39.078 --> 00:09:43.383 region:rollup3
to make sure we are.

00:09:39.546 --> 00:09:45.085 region:rollup3
Attacked it as we possibly can.

00:09:40.947 --> 00:09:47.220 region:rollup3
And finally assembly member Lee

00:09:43.383 --> 00:09:49.189 region:rollup3
Monning I after we hear from

00:09:45.085 --> 00:09:51.024 region:rollup3
both of our local community

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:52.859 region:rollup3
where we are in has everyone

00:09:49.189 --> 00:09:54.894 region:rollup3
picked up a young [inaudible]

00:09:51.024 --> 00:09:56.996 region:rollup3
An agenda.

00:09:52.859 --> 00:09:58.932 region:rollup3
So that you at least here no --

00:09:54.894 --> 00:09:59.566 region:rollup3
Where we're going to start and

00:09:56.996 --> 00:10:00.967 region:rollup3
perhaps assembly member will it

00:09:58.932 --> 00:10:01.501 region:rollup3
remind everyone who is at home

00:09:59.566 --> 00:10:03.536 region:rollup3
and not if not?

00:10:00.967 --> 00:10:05.138 region:rollup3
I able to follow with the

00:10:01.501 --> 00:10:07.407 region:rollup3
agenda.

00:10:03.536 --> 00:10:09.175 region:rollup3
Of who were all gonna be

00:10:05.138 --> 00:10:09.742 region:rollup3
speaking at the end assembly

00:10:07.407 --> 00:10:12.946 region:rollup3
member.

00:10:09.175 --> 00:10:13.513 region:rollup3
Are going to follow up with

00:10:09.742 --> 00:10:15.014 region:rollup3
legislative update on the work

00:10:12.946 --> 00:10:15.648 region:rollup3
that we've been doing in the

00:10:13.513 --> 00:10:17.016 region:rollup3
budget efforts.

00:10:15.014 --> 00:10:18.818 region:rollup3
You know part of the challenge

00:10:15.648 --> 00:10:19.486 region:rollup3
when you start rebuilding is

00:10:17.016 --> 00:10:21.120 region:rollup3
where's the money.

00:10:18.818 --> 00:10:22.889 region:rollup3
And of course we'll have someone

00:10:19.486 --> 00:10:24.991 region:rollup3
talking about the insurance

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:25.592 region:rollup3
challenges for private property

00:10:22.889 --> 00:10:26.226 region:rollup3
owners but the state has really

00:10:24.991 --> 00:10:27.060 region:rollup3
tried to step in the federal

00:10:25.592 --> 00:10:31.297 region:rollup3
government stepped in to help us

00:10:26.226 --> 00:10:32.966 region:rollup3
--

00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:33.566 region:rollup3
With data of recovery in rebuilt

00:10:31.297 --> 00:10:37.003 region:rollup3
at and yet there's a lot more to

00:10:32.966 --> 00:10:37.504 region:rollup3
do so with that I want to hand

00:10:33.566 --> 00:10:39.105 region:rollup3
--

00:10:37.003 --> 00:10:41.374 region:rollup3
The microphone with new

00:10:37.504 --> 00:10:41.774 region:rollup3
batteries over to assembly

00:10:39.105 --> 00:10:43.209 region:rollup3
member of the Monning for

00:10:41.374 --> 00:10:45.512 region:rollup3
opening remarks.

00:10:41.774 --> 00:10:47.180 region:rollup3
Thank you senator and I think

00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:53.786 region:rollup3
I'm.

00:10:51.251 --> 00:10:55.421 region:rollup3
I think process throughout the

00:10:53.186 --> 00:10:57.590 region:rollup3
moments that our communities

00:10:53.786 --> 00:10:57.857 region:rollup3
have been living when we decided

00:10:55.421 --> 00:10:59.392 region:rollup3
to move forward with having this

00:10:57.590 --> 00:11:01.394 region:rollup3
hearing.

00:10:57.857 --> 00:11:03.096 region:rollup3
We did it with the purpose of

00:10:59.392 --> 00:11:04.864 region:rollup3
wanting to bring a little of the

00:11:01.394 --> 00:11:05.431 region:rollup3
work that we do in Sacramento to

00:11:03.096 --> 00:11:07.267 region:rollup3

00:11:04.864 --> 00:11:09.202 region:rollup3
I'm we've had hearings in

And really the goal of this

00:11:21.114 --> 00:11:27.053 region:rollup3
hearing is simply that and this

00:11:23.116 --> 00:11:27.720 region:rollup3
will be part of our legislative

00:11:24.951 --> 00:11:28.254 region:rollup3

00:11:43.069 --> 00:11:49.208 region:rollup3
In terms of natural disasters in

00:11:45.071 --> 00:11:49.842 region:rollup3

00:11:49.208 --> 00:11:53.079 region:rollup3

00:11:49.842 --> 00:11:55.014 region:rollup3
alone.

00:11:50.944 --> 00:11:57.150 region:rollup3
And we do collaborative Lee with

00:11:53.079 --> 00:11:57.784 region:rollup3

solutions onto these to the

00:12:35.288 --> 00:12:39.459 region:rollup3
magnitude of problems that we've

00:12:37.457 --> 00:12:41.494 region:rollup3
seen.

00:12:37.657 --> 00:12:43.329 region:rollup3
We do expect that this is one

00:12:39.459 --> 00:12:43.763 region:rollup3
piece of a puzzle that

00:12:41.494 --> 00:12:45.331 region:rollup3
dachshunds onto a better

00:12:43.329 --> 00:12:47.267 region:rollup3
solution to a better

00:12:43.763 --> 00:12:49.469 region:rollup3
understanding of the issues that

00:12:45.331 --> 00:12:51.137 region:rollup3
our community is going.

00:12:47.267 --> 00:12:53.239 region:rollup3
Up through and the ways that we

00:12:49.469 --> 00:12:55.074 region:rollup3
can address them within our

00:12:51.137 --> 00:12:56.943 region:rollup3
roles as in the state we have

00:12:53.239 --> 00:12:59.112 region:rollup3
some capacity to address some

00:12:55.074 --> 00:12:59.445 region:rollup3
but that's not the only area are

00:12:56.943 --> 00:13:01.080 region:rollup3
only space where these if it can

00:12:59.112 --> 00:13:03.149 region:rollup3
be addressed.

00:12:59.445 --> 00:13:03.783 region:rollup3

00:14:05.845 --> 00:14:11.017 region:rollup3
And to whom I'd like to share

00:14:07.513 --> 00:14:11.617 region:rollup3
with you one of them is --

00:14:09.248 --> 00:14:13.119 region:rollup3
Stronger together.

00:14:11.017 --> 00:14:15.655 region:rollup3
And the second one is we got

Yeah during the debris flow in

00:14:15.655 --> 00:14:23.229 region:rollup3
the Tom to fire I think this

00:14:17.457 --> 00:14:25.398 region:rollup3
community had both those models

00:14:21.194 --> 00:14:26.032 region:rollup3
as a community models as well.

00:14:23.229 --> 00:14:27.433 region:rollup3
We all did our part we're

00:14:25.398 --> 00:14:29.369 region:rollup3
stronger together we're all we

00:14:26.032 --> 00:14:29.669 region:rollup3
all did our part during the

00:14:27.433 --> 00:14:31.671 region:rollup3
disaster and then in the

00:14:29.369 --> 00:14:33.473 region:rollup3
aftermath.

00:14:29.669 --> 00:14:35.375 region:rollup3
And here mama C. no union school

00:14:31.671 --> 00:14:37.210 region:rollup3

00:14:33.473 --> 00:14:39.312 region:rollup3
to be stronger together we where

00:14:35.375 --> 00:14:39.846 region:rollup3

contractor's.

00:14:45.151 --> 00:14:49.889 region:rollup3
Because we feel that a strong

00:14:57.330 --> 00:15:03.169 region:rollup3
Everybody in this community

00:14:57.897 --> 00:15:05.171 region:rollup3

Well you're gonna hear today is

00:17:33.786 --> 00:17:39.559 region:rollup3
our approach.

00:17:35.288 --> 00:17:41.627 region:rollup3
The key Monticello way of

00:17:35.855 --> 00:17:43.429 region:rollup3
recovery and all disasters or

00:17:39.559 --> 00:17:45.298 region:rollup3
local I think what this has

00:17:41.627 --> 00:17:45.831 region:rollup3
shown us is that this is really

00:17:43.429 --> 00:17:47.300 region:rollup3
been experience.

00:17:45.298 --> 00:17:47.867 region:rollup3
Of neighbors working with

00:17:45.831 --> 00:17:49.402 region:rollup3
neighbors.

00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:49.936 region:rollup3
And residents working with

00:17:47.867 --> 00:17:51.404 region:rollup3
county government.

00:17:49.402 --> 00:17:53.572 region:rollup3
And we know we can't do it

00:17:49.936 --> 00:17:55.641 region:rollup3
alone.

00:17:51.404 --> 00:17:57.843 region:rollup3
And we've relied on and continue

00:17:53.572 --> 00:17:59.412 region:rollup3
to rely on the smarts and the

00:17:55.641 --> 00:18:03.516 region:rollup3
skills and the vigor and energy.

00:17:57.843 --> 00:18:04.116 region:rollup3
Of monitor residents

00:17:59.412 --> 00:18:05.284 region:rollup3
philanthropists and non profits

00:18:03.516 --> 00:18:07.687 region:rollup3

On for the last six months and

will continue.

00:18:35.381 --> 00:18:41.754 region:rollup3
Is about our plan.

00:18:37.383 --> 00:18:43.589 region:rollup3
Which emphasizes resiliency and

00:18:39.518 --> 00:18:44.090 region:rollup3
understanding the uniqueness of

Monticello.

00:18:43.589 --> 00:18:46.225 region:rollup3
Plants focus is on the

00:18:44.090 --> 00:18:47.393 region:rollup3
fundamental that is I. county

00:18:45.591 --> 00:18:49.662 region:rollup3

to bear.

00:18:47.393 --> 00:18:53.799 region:rollup3
Within our purview that we can

00:18:49.662 --> 00:18:55.368 region:rollup3
actually catalyze it contains an

00:18:51.764 --> 00:18:57.403 region:rollup3
array of actions them at will

00:18:53.799 --> 00:18:59.372 region:rollup3
discuss but it's basically

00:18:55.368 --> 00:19:01.407 region:rollup3
focused on how to reduce.

00:18:57.403 --> 00:19:03.542 region:rollup3
Future risks how we prepare. For

00:18:59.372 --> 00:19:05.578 region:rollup3
the next disaster how can we

00:19:01.407 --> 00:19:06.078 region:rollup3
enable residents to rebuild as

00:19:03.542 --> 00:19:06.379 region:rollup3

Really quite extraordinary

00:19:55.795 --> 00:20:01.567 region:rollup3
unlike any other fire I think

00:19:57.863 --> 00:20:03.602 region:rollup3
that California's had and

00:19:59.598 --> 00:20:05.471 region:rollup3

Talked about when they talk

00:21:39.999 --> 00:21:43.836 region:rollup3
about structure together.

00:21:41.767 --> 00:21:46.272 region:rollup3
Because if we look at this

00:21:42.334 --> 00:21:47.673 region:rollup3
Republic plan this is something

00:21:43.836 --> 00:21:48.340 region:rollup3
that the county could absolutely

00:21:46.272 --> 00:21:51.744 region:rollup3
Dodd do alone.

00:21:47.673 --> 00:21:52.278 region:rollup3
It took a lot of work from a lot

00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:52.912 region:rollup3
of our partners --

00:21:51.744 --> 00:21:53.579 region:rollup3
The partnership resilient

00:21:52.278 --> 00:21:56.015 region:rollup3
communities provided an expert

00:21:52.912 --> 00:21:59.652 region:rollup3
to us.

00:21:53.579 --> 00:22:01.587 region:rollup3
That had worked for FEMA and

00:21:56.015 --> 00:22:03.722 region:rollup3
callow yes that helped us a line

00:21:59.652 --> 00:22:05.791 region:rollup3
all of our actions toward.

00:22:01.587 --> 00:22:07.560 region:rollup3
Callaway yes template and FEMA

00:22:03.722 --> 00:22:09.829 region:rollup3
templates so that we were sure

00:22:05.791 --> 00:22:10.262 region:rollup3
that we didn't miss anything as

00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:12.097 region:rollup3
we tried to figure out this

00:22:09.829 --> 00:22:13.866 region:rollup3
incredible puzzle.

00:22:10.262 --> 00:22:15.834 region:rollup3
And provide the community of

00:22:12.097 --> 00:22:17.603 region:rollup3
Mont aceto with all of the tools

00:22:13.866 --> 00:22:19.905 region:rollup3
that they needed to help getting

00:22:15.834 --> 00:22:20.506 region:rollup3
back on their feet.

00:22:17.603 --> 00:22:24.410 region:rollup3
So with that the recovery

00:22:19.905 --> 00:22:26.312 region:rollup3
strategic plan really is our

00:22:20.506 --> 00:22:28.080 region:rollup3
efforts that pulled together all

00:22:24.410 --> 00:22:28.714 region:rollup3
the different disciplines.

00:22:26.312 --> 00:22:30.216 region:rollup3
And it is not what those

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:34.320 region:rollup3
documents that lives on shelves

00:22:28.714 --> 00:22:34.887 region:rollup3
where.

00:22:30.216 --> 00:22:36.722 region:rollup3
The action versions D..

00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:37.990 region:rollup3
One of this plan it and the

00:22:34.887 --> 00:22:38.290 region:rollup3
short couple months that we've

00:22:36.722 --> 00:22:39.758 region:rollup3
had because it is change so much

00:22:37.990 --> 00:22:42.061 region:rollup3
[inaudible]

00:22:38.290 --> 00:22:43.929 region:rollup3
Return.

00:22:39.758 --> 00:22:44.330 region:rollup3
And in New I'd come in.

00:22:42.061 --> 00:22:45.764 region:rollup3
We bring him it would solve Mike

solving puzzles.

00:22:44.330 --> 00:22:50.202 region:rollup3
And then.

00:22:45.764 --> 00:22:52.004 region:rollup3
We continue to work for them.

00:22:47.967 --> 00:22:54.039 region:rollup3
So based upon those kinds of

00:22:50.202 --> 00:22:54.607 region:rollup3
ideas the plan had to be

00:22:52.004 --> 00:22:55.574 region:rollup3
flexible had to be very

00:22:54.039 --> 00:22:57.943 region:rollup3
efficient with our with our

00:22:54.607 --> 00:22:59.845 region:rollup3
staff time.

00:22:55.574 --> 00:23:00.145 region:rollup3
That absolutely had dated driven

00:22:57.943 --> 00:23:02.114 region:rollup3
decisions being made

00:22:59.845 --> 00:23:04.283 region:rollup3
[inaudible]

00:23:00.145 --> 00:23:05.951 region:rollup3
We I had the end goal of always

00:23:02.114 --> 00:23:09.889 region:rollup3
headed towards a more resilient

00:25:06.105 --> 00:25:11.977 region:rollup3
future future debris flows.

00:25:10.142 --> 00:25:12.611 region:rollup3
Sure we have a rebuilding

00:25:10.709 --> 00:25:15.748 region:rollup3
process for all different

00:25:11.977 --> 00:25:16.382 region:rollup3
category is of damaged and droid

00:25:12.611 --> 00:25:17.950 region:rollup3
properties.

00:25:15.748 --> 00:25:18.250 region:rollup3
And they were communicating the

00:25:16.382 --> 00:25:21.687 region:rollup3
strategies the community

00:25:17.950 --> 00:25:23.822 region:rollup3
[inaudible]

00:25:18.250 --> 00:25:24.390 region:rollup3
Slide.

00:25:21.687 --> 00:25:26.091 region:rollup3
I'm through a couple issues the

00:25:23.822 --> 00:25:28.093 region:rollup3
first one storm preparation

00:25:24.390 --> 00:25:30.429 region:rollup3
evacuation.

00:25:26.091 --> 00:25:33.866 region:rollup3
And I should know this report

00:25:28.093 --> 00:25:34.500 region:rollup3
really is a very thick report

00:25:30.429 --> 00:25:35.901 region:rollup3
that I'll show you the address

00:25:33.866 --> 00:25:36.602 region:rollup3
of the very end where you can go

00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:37.236 region:rollup3
when.

00:25:35.901 --> 00:25:39.772 region:rollup3
See more depth of the report and

00:25:36.602 --> 00:25:42.141 region:rollup3
what we're doing today is just a

00:25:37.236 --> 00:25:42.741 region:rollup3
really high level --

00:25:39.772 --> 00:25:45.844 region:rollup3
Topic overview --

00:25:42.141 --> 00:25:47.980 region:rollup3
If any sections as multiple

00:25:42.741 --> 00:25:49.982 region:rollup3
pages and multiple portions --

00:25:45.844 --> 00:25:50.182 region:rollup3
Under storm preparation

00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:52.251 region:rollup3
evacuation are Ted us locally

00:25:49.982 --> 00:25:52.751 region:rollup3
here.

00:25:50.182 --> 00:25:54.319 region:rollup3
Is that we're finalizing our

00:25:52.251 --> 00:25:58.090 region:rollup3
criteria for evacuation

00:25:52.751 --> 00:25:58.724 region:rollup3
thresholds.

00:25:54.319 --> 00:26:00.159 region:rollup3
And we know that --

00:25:58.090 --> 00:26:02.394 region:rollup3
That is really important into

00:25:58.724 --> 00:26:04.463 region:rollup3
how many folks are going to be

00:26:00.159 --> 00:26:05.831 region:rollup3
evacuating this winter we had a

00:26:02.394 --> 00:26:06.398 region:rollup3
lot of resources for John again

00:26:04.463 --> 00:26:08.133 region:rollup3
data behind those decisions.

00:26:05.831 --> 00:26:10.369 region:rollup3
And a team of public safety

00:26:06.398 --> 00:26:12.137 region:rollup3
professionals.

00:26:08.133 --> 00:26:13.939 region:rollup3
And scientists they're working

00:26:10.369 --> 00:26:16.241 region:rollup3
together. To to work on that

00:26:12.137 --> 00:26:17.709 region:rollup3
storm preparation.

00:26:13.939 --> 00:26:18.277 region:rollup3
We're updating the risk map.

00:26:16.241 --> 00:26:20.045 region:rollup3
That has a debris flow --

00:26:17.709 --> 00:26:22.147 region:rollup3
Portion of it as you're all

00:26:18.277 --> 00:26:24.149 region:rollup3
aware of the hazard maps.

00:26:20.045 --> 00:26:24.817 region:rollup3
We have a contractor that's

00:26:22.147 --> 00:26:26.418 region:rollup3
helping us through that.

00:26:24.149 --> 00:26:28.053 region:rollup3
We're also gonna have starting

00:26:24.817 --> 00:26:30.122 region:rollup3
in September a large outreach

00:26:26.418 --> 00:26:32.124 region:rollup3
and education plan.

00:26:28.053 --> 00:26:32.691 region:rollup3
But we will be back here

00:26:30.122 --> 00:26:34.259 region:rollup3
hopefully again --

00:26:32.124 --> 00:26:35.994 region:rollup3
Many times before the rainy

00:26:32.691 --> 00:26:38.530 region:rollup3
season [inaudible]

00:26:34.259 --> 00:26:42.267 region:rollup3
Next like.

00:26:35.994 --> 00:26:42.734 region:rollup3
This slide should look familiar

00:26:38.530 --> 00:26:43.202 region:rollup3
to a lot of you and this was the

00:26:42.267 --> 00:26:44.002 region:rollup3
seventy two hour storm

00:26:42.734 --> 00:26:46.472 region:rollup3
evacuation timeline.

00:26:43.202 --> 00:26:48.407 region:rollup3
That we used last year.

00:26:44.002 --> 00:26:49.007 region:rollup3
And so we're gonna be revisiting

00:26:46.472 --> 00:26:51.910 region:rollup3
that time line for this year

00:26:48.407 --> 00:26:52.611 region:rollup3
we're gonna be adjusting it.

00:26:49.007 --> 00:26:54.079 region:rollup3
Will be.

00:26:51.910 --> 00:26:54.680 region:rollup3
Making sure that the things that

00:26:52.611 --> 00:26:56.748 region:rollup3
we worked really well continue.

00:26:54.079 --> 00:26:58.250 region:rollup3
Mendoza is that we need to

00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:58.817 region:rollup3
improve on that we're gonna

00:26:56.748 --> 00:27:00.586 region:rollup3
prove what we had a lot of

00:26:58.250 --> 00:27:02.020 region:rollup3
comments over the last six

00:26:58.817 --> 00:27:02.688 region:rollup3
months on dates that we could do

00:27:00.586 --> 00:27:04.189 region:rollup3
better in this area.

00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:06.024 region:rollup3
And we are taking them all under

00:27:02.688 --> 00:27:08.594 region:rollup3
advisement [inaudible]

00:27:04.189 --> 00:27:09.094 region:rollup3
Slot.

00:27:06.024 --> 00:27:10.729 region:rollup3
Under the long term flood

00:27:08.594 --> 00:27:13.932 region:rollup3
control mitigation us.

00:27:09.094 --> 00:27:16.301 region:rollup3
Consultant that's working on

00:27:10.729 --> 00:27:16.935 region:rollup3
debris based modifications.

00:27:13.932 --> 00:27:18.137 region:rollup3
We have Mike Corbin appears

00:27:16.301 --> 00:27:20.372 region:rollup3
that's been analyzing our basin

00:27:16.935 --> 00:27:22.574 region:rollup3
and our channel capacity.

00:27:18.137 --> 00:27:22.908 region:rollup3
We have a bunch of hazard

00:27:20.372 --> 00:27:26.178 region:rollup3
mitigation grant program that's

00:27:22.574 --> 00:27:28.547 region:rollup3
that acting.

00:27:22.908 --> 00:27:28.747 region:rollup3
H. M. G. P. up there --

00:27:26.178 --> 00:27:30.315 region:rollup3
And NY preserve intent and these

00:27:28.547 --> 00:27:31.950 region:rollup3
are.

00:27:28.747 --> 00:27:34.052 region:rollup3
Gramps there were going to be

00:27:30.315 --> 00:27:34.620 region:rollup3
going after.

00:27:31.950 --> 00:27:35.821 region:rollup3
That -- Help.

00:27:34.052 --> 00:27:36.121 region:rollup3
Us fund Curt flood control

00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:40.225 region:rollup3
mitigation in the few

00:27:35.821 --> 00:27:40.859 region:rollup3
[inaudible]

00:27:36.121 --> 00:27:42.261 region:rollup3
And we have a lot of information

00:27:40.225 --> 00:27:44.630 region:rollup3
it'll be coming out on that and

00:27:40.859 --> 00:27:46.298 region:rollup3
then months ahead.

00:27:42.261 --> 00:27:46.865 region:rollup3
It will be back in for with one

00:27:44.630 --> 00:27:48.500 region:rollup3
of our board of supervisors in

00:27:46.298 --> 00:27:50.168 region:rollup3
late August discuss some of

00:27:46.865 --> 00:27:52.004 region:rollup3
those --

00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:54.306 region:rollup3
Medications.

00:27:50.168 --> 00:27:56.375 region:rollup3
Open those --

00:27:52.004 --> 00:27:58.210 region:rollup3
And applications all they also

00:27:54.306 --> 00:28:00.279 region:rollup3
include a future disposal sites.

00:27:56.375 --> 00:28:00.879 region:rollup3
So we have a place to put the

00:27:58.210 --> 00:28:01.980 region:rollup3
mud and debris and wanted out.

00:28:00.279 --> 00:28:02.581 region:rollup3
Should we get further but and

00:28:00.879 --> 00:28:06.018 region:rollup3
close.

00:28:01.980 --> 00:28:08.120 region:rollup3
And property acquisition for

00:28:02.581 --> 00:28:12.024 region:rollup3
flood ease and flood easements.

00:28:06.018 --> 00:28:12.558 region:rollup3
It's like this.

00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:14.359 region:rollup3
Every property rebuilding.

00:28:12.024 --> 00:28:18.030 region:rollup3
This is one of the most

00:28:12.558 --> 00:28:18.697 region:rollup3
important issues that we took

00:28:14.359 --> 00:28:22.067 region:rollup3
our over the last few months.

00:28:18.030 --> 00:28:24.036 region:rollup3
And will we tried to do was put

00:28:18.697 --> 00:28:26.438 region:rollup3
everything we needed. To put it

00:28:22.067 --> 00:28:28.140 region:rollup3
together to make.

00:28:24.036 --> 00:28:30.142 region:rollup3
Sabol for property owners.

00:28:26.438 --> 00:28:32.844 region:rollup3
Make informed decisions about.

00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:34.379 region:rollup3
The rebuilding options.

00:28:30.142 --> 00:28:36.548 region:rollup3
This included identifying and

00:28:32.844 --> 00:28:38.083 region:rollup3
categorized all impacted

00:28:34.379 --> 00:28:40.519 region:rollup3
properties are planning and

00:28:36.548 --> 00:28:41.920 region:rollup3
develop development department.

00:28:38.083 --> 00:28:43.956 region:rollup3
Together and attractive map that

00:28:40.519 --> 00:28:46.358 region:rollup3
depicts all of the different --

00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:48.360 region:rollup3
Statuses of those properties.

00:28:43.956 --> 00:28:48.860 region:rollup3
Our borders divisors led by

00:28:46.358 --> 00:28:49.962 region:rollup3
supervisor Dodd Williams.

00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:50.596 region:rollup3
Bob did a like for like

00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:52.698 region:rollup3
ordinance.

00:28:49.962 --> 00:28:54.299 region:rollup3
That was a little more in tune

00:28:50.596 --> 00:28:55.968 region:rollup3
and flexible with the type of

00:28:52.698 --> 00:28:58.437 region:rollup3
conditions that exist here in

00:28:54.299 --> 00:29:00.572 region:rollup3
modest ito.

00:28:55.968 --> 00:29:02.174 region:rollup3
After the brief low.

00:28:58.437 --> 00:29:04.409 region:rollup3
Our coastal commission adopted

00:29:00.572 --> 00:29:06.311 region:rollup3
that like for like ordinance.

00:29:02.174 --> 00:29:06.945 region:rollup3
De our board of supervisors

00:29:04.409 --> 00:29:10.248 region:rollup3
adopted the FEMA map that we

00:29:06.311 --> 00:29:10.549 region:rollup3
talked about last night here at

00:29:06.945 --> 00:29:12.317 region:rollup3
the community meeting --

00:29:10.248 --> 00:29:14.419 region:rollup3
Helped give.

00:29:10.549 --> 00:29:16.388 region:rollup3
Folks --

00:29:12.317 --> 00:29:18.457 region:rollup3
Their understanding of the

00:29:14.419 --> 00:29:19.091 region:rollup3
possibilities with flood.

00:29:16.388 --> 00:29:20.892 region:rollup3
Based upon the current condition

00:29:18.457 --> 00:29:22.561 region:rollup3
of the vegetate Jim in the hills

00:29:19.091 --> 00:29:26.331 region:rollup3
--

00:29:20.892 --> 00:29:28.567 region:rollup3
Behind us here [inaudible]

00:29:22.561 --> 00:29:30.369 region:rollup3
And we have set up case manager.

00:29:26.331 --> 00:29:32.771 region:rollup3
And a local team of architects

00:29:28.567 --> 00:29:34.573 region:rollup3
and engineers to work together

00:29:30.369 --> 00:29:36.675 region:rollup3
with homeowners. To hopefully

00:29:32.771 --> 00:29:38.510 region:rollup3
wide forks many options it has

00:29:34.573 --> 00:29:40.112 region:rollup3
many different Hannah I. is as

00:29:36.675 --> 00:29:40.412 region:rollup3
possible that help inform them

00:29:38.510 --> 00:29:42.147 region:rollup3
about their decisions

00:29:40.112 --> 00:29:44.349 region:rollup3
[inaudible]

00:29:40.412 --> 00:29:46.551 region:rollup3
It's like.

00:29:42.147 --> 00:29:48.720 region:rollup3
Is you for was to breeze on

00:29:44.349 --> 00:29:49.421 region:rollup3
private property.

00:29:46.551 --> 00:29:50.522 region:rollup3
And as you're all acutely aware

00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:52.491 region:rollup3
this is been an issue that we've

00:29:49.421 --> 00:29:54.660 region:rollup3
been struggling within and

00:29:50.522 --> 00:29:56.328 region:rollup3
working on for romance --

00:29:52.491 --> 00:29:56.962 region:rollup3
We're still maintain the

00:29:54.660 --> 00:30:00.399 region:rollup3
materials exchange website

00:29:56.328 --> 00:30:00.899 region:rollup3
without a lot of really positive

00:29:56.962 --> 00:30:02.467 region:rollup3
--

00:30:00.399 --> 00:30:04.603 region:rollup3
Feedback that that --

00:30:00.899 --> 00:30:06.405 region:rollup3
Lot homeowners were using that.

00:30:02.467 --> 00:30:08.073 region:rollup3
And being able --

00:30:04.603 --> 00:30:10.208 region:rollup3
To remove boulders and rocks and

00:30:06.405 --> 00:30:12.411 region:rollup3
and soil from that.

00:30:08.073 --> 00:30:14.346 region:rollup3
Our household waste --

00:30:10.208 --> 00:30:14.913 region:rollup3
Hazardous waste household

00:30:12.411 --> 00:30:16.648 region:rollup3
hazardous waste pick ups we have

00:30:14.346 --> 00:30:18.317 region:rollup3
completed to those in the

00:30:14.913 --> 00:30:20.419 region:rollup3
community the remove those items

00:30:16.648 --> 00:30:22.187 region:rollup3
from -- The

00:30:18.317 --> 00:30:24.656 region:rollup3
areas that --

00:30:20.419 --> 00:30:26.491 region:rollup3
There were hazardous in nature.

00:30:22.187 --> 00:30:28.226 region:rollup3
We have ongoing work to try and

00:30:24.656 --> 00:30:30.729 region:rollup3
secure disposal tights.

00:30:26.491 --> 00:30:32.464 region:rollup3
So that we can quickly move and

00:30:28.226 --> 00:30:34.299 region:rollup3
debris should we get future --

00:30:30.729 --> 00:30:36.735 region:rollup3
Storm events [inaudible]

00:30:32.464 --> 00:30:38.503 region:rollup3
Slide.

00:30:34.299 --> 00:30:39.104 region:rollup3
Issue five in our recovery

00:30:36.735 --> 00:30:40.772 region:rollup3
strategic plan.

00:30:38.503 --> 00:30:44.309 region:rollup3
Dealt more with the financial

00:30:39.104 --> 00:30:46.545 region:rollup3
impacts and the economic

00:30:40.772 --> 00:30:50.449 region:rollup3
recovery of our community.

00:30:44.309 --> 00:30:52.718 region:rollup3
We have a team of folks that are

00:30:46.545 --> 00:30:54.386 region:rollup3
folks dawn full cost recovery --

00:30:50.449 --> 00:30:55.020 region:rollup3
Through the set Paris M.

00:30:52.718 --> 00:30:56.421 region:rollup3
remembers offices they've been

00:30:54.386 --> 00:30:57.022 region:rollup3
instrumental in helping us with

00:30:55.020 --> 00:30:58.490 region:rollup3
the property.

00:30:56.421 --> 00:31:00.425 region:rollup3
Tax backfill from the state of

00:30:57.022 --> 00:31:02.194 region:rollup3
California [inaudible]

00:30:58.490 --> 00:31:04.663 region:rollup3
That is.

00:31:00.425 --> 00:31:06.298 region:rollup3
Critically important it and

00:31:02.194 --> 00:31:08.166 region:rollup3
given us the tools we have that

00:31:04.663 --> 00:31:08.734 region:rollup3
we need here locally to do some

00:31:06.298 --> 00:31:10.635 region:rollup3
of these hazard mitigation.

00:31:08.166 --> 00:31:12.738 region:rollup3
Projects and other things.

00:31:08.734 --> 00:31:14.773 region:rollup3
We have thirteen had negation

00:31:10.635 --> 00:31:15.273 region:rollup3
grant projects [inaudible]

00:31:12.738 --> 00:31:16.675 region:rollup3
They're submitted. To a total

00:31:14.773 --> 00:31:18.410 region:rollup3
ask of fifty two million

00:31:15.273 --> 00:31:18.977 region:rollup3
dollars.

00:31:16.675 --> 00:31:22.514 region:rollup3
But there would comes with the

00:31:18.410 --> 00:31:23.148 region:rollup3
local match of over twelve

00:31:18.977 --> 00:31:26.251 region:rollup3
million dollars --

00:31:22.514 --> 00:31:26.885 region:rollup3
We have state and federal level

00:31:23.148 --> 00:31:28.387 region:rollup3
coordination several different

00:31:26.251 --> 00:31:30.589 region:rollup3
kind of matching funds that were

00:31:26.885 --> 00:31:31.256 region:rollup3
working through right now.

00:31:28.387 --> 00:31:32.491 region:rollup3
And we have long term funding

00:31:30.589 --> 00:31:34.793 region:rollup3
sources need four of the capital

00:31:31.256 --> 00:31:38.130 region:rollup3
and the maintenance.

00:31:32.491 --> 00:31:40.332 region:rollup3
We have a flood control district

00:31:34.793 --> 00:31:42.434 region:rollup3
and certainly this event has

00:31:38.130 --> 00:31:44.269 region:rollup3
overwhelmed that district but

00:31:40.332 --> 00:31:44.870 region:rollup3
but we've got some ideas and

00:31:42.434 --> 00:31:46.371 region:rollup3
some others DB G. --

00:31:44.269 --> 00:31:48.373 region:rollup3
Committee develop blocker and

00:31:44.870 --> 00:31:48.974 region:rollup3
other tools that --

00:31:46.371 --> 00:31:50.575 region:rollup3
They were hoping that we can use

00:31:48.373 --> 00:31:50.876 region:rollup3
and and leverage some of our

00:31:48.974 --> 00:31:54.513 region:rollup3
other resources with

00:31:50.575 --> 00:31:55.080 region:rollup3
[inaudible]

00:31:50.876 --> 00:31:56.348 region:rollup3
Next slide.

00:31:54.513 --> 00:31:56.882 region:rollup3
Issue six in the recovery

00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:58.417 region:rollup3
strategic plan was

00:31:56.348 --> 00:32:00.585 region:rollup3
infrastructure repair and

00:31:56.882 --> 00:32:02.320 region:rollup3
modifications.

00:31:58.417 --> 00:32:04.489 region:rollup3
And this is an area where we've

00:32:00.585 --> 00:32:05.023 region:rollup3
listed just a few projects here.

00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:06.758 region:rollup3
Most of the projects that we've

00:32:04.489 --> 00:32:08.693 region:rollup3
been working on a bridge

00:32:05.023 --> 00:32:10.295 region:rollup3
improvements in culverts and

00:32:06.758 --> 00:32:12.798 region:rollup3
drainages [inaudible]

00:32:08.693 --> 00:32:13.398 region:rollup3
Drainage facilities to improve

00:32:10.295 --> 00:32:14.733 region:rollup3
though to not only bill back

00:32:12.798 --> 00:32:16.802 region:rollup3
what was destroyed during the

00:32:13.398 --> 00:32:17.335 region:rollup3
one night event.

00:32:14.733 --> 00:32:20.305 region:rollup3
But also enhanced I'm so that

00:32:16.802 --> 00:32:24.676 region:rollup3
they can be more effective

00:32:17.335 --> 00:32:25.210 region:rollup3
should we get additional --

00:32:20.305 --> 00:32:26.778 region:rollup3
Debris flow and high intensity.

00:32:24.676 --> 00:32:28.180 region:rollup3
We've also done other has

00:32:25.210 --> 00:32:28.847 region:rollup3
delegation projects for Bella

00:32:26.778 --> 00:32:30.515 region:rollup3
Vista.

00:32:28.180 --> 00:32:34.519 region:rollup3
And at least those drive covert

00:32:28.847 --> 00:32:35.120 region:rollup3
replacements and it --

00:32:30.515 --> 00:32:42.727 region:rollup3
And with the goal to restore

00:32:34.519 --> 00:32:44.396 region:rollup3
those facilities to pre storm.

00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:46.698 region:rollup3
Edition. Seven focused on our

00:32:42.727 --> 00:32:47.365 region:rollup3
natural and cultural resource.

00:32:44.396 --> 00:32:50.368 region:rollup3
As you're aware and those you

00:32:46.698 --> 00:32:52.871 region:rollup3
thing of Ben and Montesinos or

00:32:47.365 --> 00:32:54.539 region:rollup3
live here for a long time --

00:32:50.368 --> 00:32:58.677 region:rollup3
Looks quite different in many of

00:32:52.871 --> 00:32:59.211 region:rollup3
the areas across mundus ito so

00:32:54.539 --> 00:33:00.712 region:rollup3
we've been in discussions on

00:32:58.677 --> 00:33:02.514 region:rollup3
engaging the community on

00:32:59.211 --> 00:33:04.382 region:rollup3
different kinds of ideas.

00:33:00.712 --> 00:33:06.551 region:rollup3
Potential projects to help

00:33:02.514 --> 00:33:08.520 region:rollup3
restore some of the patrol or

00:33:04.382 --> 00:33:09.187 region:rollup3
cultural resources --

00:33:06.551 --> 00:33:09.788 region:rollup3
Along the watersheds.

00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:10.422 region:rollup3
We've also been induced should

00:33:09.187 --> 00:33:12.557 region:rollup3
simply was Hannah Barbara land

00:33:09.788 --> 00:33:14.493 region:rollup3
trust.

00:33:10.422 --> 00:33:18.530 region:rollup3
Looking for opportunities to

00:33:12.557 --> 00:33:20.799 region:rollup3
collaborate together. To to

00:33:14.493 --> 00:33:22.234 region:rollup3
provide for some areas that duh.

00:33:18.530 --> 00:33:24.836 region:rollup3
Did help both of you a set back

00:33:20.799 --> 00:33:26.404 region:rollup3
from watercourses.

00:33:22.234 --> 00:33:28.540 region:rollup3
Or allow us to do additional --

00:33:24.836 --> 00:33:34.779 region:rollup3
Debris basin [inaudible]

00:33:26.404 --> 00:33:36.715 region:rollup3
Jim measures [inaudible]

00:33:28.540 --> 00:33:38.383 region:rollup3
Slide please.

00:33:34.779 --> 00:33:43.088 region:rollup3
This chapter focused on our

00:33:36.715 --> 00:33:44.623 region:rollup3
computer community engagement.

00:33:38.383 --> 00:33:46.858 region:rollup3
One of the I think things that

00:33:43.088 --> 00:33:48.393 region:rollup3
we were able to do. To work

00:33:44.623 --> 00:33:50.428 region:rollup3
collaboratively clap Lee with or

00:33:46.858 --> 00:33:52.697 region:rollup3
fuller foundation.

00:33:48.393 --> 00:33:54.499 region:rollup3
And a whole lot of nonprofits to

00:33:50.428 --> 00:33:55.133 region:rollup3
establish a mansio center.

00:33:52.697 --> 00:33:56.601 region:rollup3
That acted like a hub.

00:33:54.499 --> 00:33:58.637 region:rollup3
Still continues to operate as a

00:33:55.133 --> 00:34:02.407 region:rollup3
hub in the community.

00:33:56.601 --> 00:34:02.941 region:rollup3
Where folks can go in and --

00:33:58.637 --> 00:34:05.010 region:rollup3
Talk one on one with the person.

00:34:02.407 --> 00:34:05.543 region:rollup3
About the issues are the

00:34:02.941 --> 00:34:06.811 region:rollup3
questions that they have and

00:34:05.010 --> 00:34:07.379 region:rollup3
it's not just call in some

00:34:05.543 --> 00:34:08.647 region:rollup3
phone.

00:34:06.811 --> 00:34:10.715 region:rollup3
Number that connects with

00:34:07.379 --> 00:34:12.817 region:rollup3
somebody --

00:34:08.647 --> 00:34:14.219 region:rollup3
That they can't see and talk.

00:34:10.715 --> 00:34:16.588 region:rollup3
To this this monitor Skinner has

00:34:12.817 --> 00:34:17.022 region:rollup3
facilitated.

00:34:14.219 --> 00:34:18.890 region:rollup3
A lot of outreach to a lot of

00:34:16.588 --> 00:34:20.358 region:rollup3
impacted residents.

00:34:17.022 --> 00:34:23.028 region:rollup3
And we've also engage the

00:34:18.890 --> 00:34:24.996 region:rollup3

00:34:31.369 --> 00:34:36.641 region:rollup3
of the movie support Beto five

00:34:32.671 --> 00:34:38.643 region:rollup3

continue to move through the

00:35:21.453 --> 00:35:25.190 region:rollup3
different phases of the

00:35:21.953 --> 00:35:26.791 region:rollup3
recovery.

00:35:24.622 --> 00:35:28.693 region:rollup3
Jean Ewing of the disaster

00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:44.676 region:rollup3
declaration [inaudible]

00:35:26.791 --> 00:35:44.676 region:rollup3
The level. To those future

00:35:28.693 --> 00:35:44.676 region:rollup3
events

00:35:58.490 --> 00:36:14.639 region:rollup3
[inaudible]

00:35:58.790 --> 00:36:14.639 region:rollup3
Looking

So next I'd like to introduce.

00:36:41.132 --> 00:36:48.907 region:rollup3
When look hope questioner?

00:36:44.636 --> 00:36:50.475 region:rollup3
I think it I think if we may

00:36:46.704 --> 00:36:52.510 region:rollup3
just take questions toward the

00:36:48.907 --> 00:36:54.512 region:rollup3
end because otherwise we're not

00:36:50.475 --> 00:36:55.146 region:rollup3
going to get through this --

00:36:52.510 --> 00:36:56.648 region:rollup3
Program and we want to hear from

00:36:54.512 --> 00:36:58.783 region:rollup3
everyone so say that program I

00:36:55.146 --> 00:37:00.952 region:rollup3
got a couple.

Thank you senator Jackson --

00:37:12.530 --> 00:37:17.368 region:rollup3
Mona I I was thinking as you

00:37:14.966 --> 00:37:18.770 region:rollup3
were talking about the five

00:37:16.801 --> 00:37:20.705 region:rollup3
pounds you gain that I was

00:37:17.368 --> 00:37:22.740 region:rollup3
started to wonder about the

00:37:18.770 --> 00:37:24.476 region:rollup3
environmental impact of the

00:37:20.705 --> 00:37:25.043 region:rollup3
collective weight we've all

00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:26.644 region:rollup3
games and thinking that maybe we

00:37:24.476 --> 00:37:28.913 region:rollup3
need to put together like a

00:37:25.043 --> 00:37:30.582 region:rollup3
community --

00:37:26.644 --> 00:37:30.949 region:rollup3
Health program after we get

00:37:28.913 --> 00:37:32.517 region:rollup3
through the resiliency plan.

00:37:30.582 --> 00:37:36.688 region:rollup3
I'm [inaudible]

00:37:30.949 --> 00:37:37.222 region:rollup3
So.

00:37:32.517 --> 00:37:39.057 region:rollup3
I. in over the last few weeks

00:37:36.688 --> 00:37:39.657 region:rollup3
will bite most her young

00:37:37.222 --> 00:37:40.558 region:rollup3
schreiben watching with great

00:37:39.057 --> 00:37:43.094 region:rollup3
interest the rescuing of these

00:37:39.657 --> 00:37:46.831 region:rollup3
--

00:37:40.558 --> 00:37:47.465 region:rollup3
Boys in Thailand in this cave

00:37:43.094 --> 00:37:50.702 region:rollup3
and you know I think there's

00:37:46.831 --> 00:37:51.269 region:rollup3
some real parallels here there

00:37:47.465 --> 00:37:54.739 region:rollup3
were in murky waters and at

00:37:50.702 --> 00:37:56.808 region:rollup3
there's not enough ox been.

00:37:51.269 --> 00:37:58.710 region:rollup3
I and we need guidance --

00:37:54.739 --> 00:38:00.411 region:rollup3
To get is to a safer place and I

00:37:56.808 --> 00:38:00.945 region:rollup3
I just want to say that we're so

my husband but I would have

00:39:14.619 --> 00:39:18.590 region:rollup3
married again after I've seen

00:39:15.253 --> 00:39:20.792 region:rollup3
the kind of effort he's put into

00:39:17.155 --> 00:39:22.760 region:rollup3
this endeavor --

00:39:18.590 --> 00:39:23.294 region:rollup3
Mary Rose who is a public policy

00:39:20.792 --> 00:39:25.196 region:rollup3
consultant has been an amazing

00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:28.633 region:rollup3
partner in this I. leaks

Mattingly another local person

00:39:25.196 --> 00:39:31.236 region:rollup3
and really what happened is

00:39:28.633 --> 00:39:33.071 region:rollup3
after the debris flow.

00:39:29.167 --> 00:39:34.806 region:rollup3
We all came together and like so

00:39:31.236 --> 00:39:36.975 region:rollup3
many people we were looking for

00:39:33.071 --> 00:39:38.710 region:rollup3
our lane --

00:39:34.806 --> 00:39:40.945 region:rollup3
Of where to help and we went to

00:39:36.975 --> 00:39:44.782 region:rollup3
the county --

00:39:38.710 --> 00:39:46.918 region:rollup3
And basically said how can we

00:39:40.945 --> 00:39:48.753 region:rollup3
help you manage this.

00:39:44.782 --> 00:39:50.688 region:rollup3
Thing that none of us have have

00:39:46.918 --> 00:39:52.890 region:rollup3
ever seen before or we were all

00:39:48.753 --> 00:39:54.892 region:rollup3
in over our heads.

00:39:50.688 --> 00:39:57.028 region:rollup3
And we've basically said we want

00:39:52.890 --> 00:39:59.163 region:rollup3
to help you make our community

00:39:54.892 --> 00:40:00.531 region:rollup3
as safe as possible and put

00:39:57.028 --> 00:40:02.800 region:rollup3
together a plan so that we can

00:39:59.163 --> 00:40:04.769 region:rollup3
emerge.

00:40:00.531 --> 00:40:07.038 region:rollup3
Quote the six million dollar man

00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:07.605 region:rollup3
better stronger faster --

00:40:04.769 --> 00:40:10.742 region:rollup3
And really get through this as a

00:40:07.038 --> 00:40:13.011 region:rollup3
more resilient community and

00:40:07.605 --> 00:40:16.714 region:rollup3
not.

00:40:10.742 --> 00:40:18.750 region:rollup3
A double negative not not be

00:40:13.011 --> 00:40:19.384 region:rollup3
able to do things because NY.

00:40:16.714 --> 00:40:20.752 region:rollup3
One edge of government didn't

00:40:18.750 --> 00:40:23.087 region:rollup3
have the bad with of the money

00:40:19.384 --> 00:40:25.223 region:rollup3
to do it.

00:40:20.752 --> 00:40:27.091 region:rollup3
So that was really our goal was

00:40:23.087 --> 00:40:30.628 region:rollup3
just what can we do now to make

00:40:25.223 --> 00:40:34.732 region:rollup3
us more safe. To make them

00:40:27.091 --> 00:40:36.968 region:rollup3
mountain more safe and that's

00:40:30.628 --> 00:40:39.237 region:rollup3
really where this all began --

00:40:34.732 --> 00:40:40.972 region:rollup3
We started by engaging leaders

00:40:36.968 --> 00:40:42.907 region:rollup3
looking around because we all

00:40:39.237 --> 00:40:44.943 region:rollup3
know that.

00:40:40.972 --> 00:40:48.880 region:rollup3
As much as this was a new thing

00:40:42.907 --> 00:40:49.213 region:rollup3
for our community or not the

00:40:44.943 --> 00:40:53.051 region:rollup3
first community to experience.

00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:54.686 region:rollup3
The error --

00:40:49.213 --> 00:40:58.823 region:rollup3
Event that you know that how to

00:40:53.051 --> 00:40:59.457 region:rollup3
do with.

00:40:54.686 --> 00:41:02.860 region:rollup3
Wildland urban interface and and

00:40:58.823 --> 00:41:04.963 region:rollup3
so there were other people in

00:40:59.457 --> 00:41:05.596 region:rollup3
Switzerland in Washington state

00:41:02.860 --> 00:41:07.131 region:rollup3
in you know all over our country

00:41:04.963 --> 00:41:08.866 region:rollup3
in the world in Japan who have

00:41:05.596 --> 00:41:10.568 region:rollup3
gone through the sorts of things

00:41:07.131 --> 00:41:11.002 region:rollup3
and there are experts out there

00:41:08.866 --> 00:41:13.037 region:rollup3
including local experts at the

00:41:10.568 --> 00:41:13.604 region:rollup3
brand school all.

00:41:11.002 --> 00:41:17.008 region:rollup3
You know geologists in people

00:41:13.037 --> 00:41:18.676 region:rollup3
who have been thinking about

00:41:13.604 --> 00:41:20.878 region:rollup3
these things forever.

00:41:17.008 --> 00:41:23.147 region:rollup3
And who really at important

00:41:18.676 --> 00:41:24.716 region:rollup3
information to teach us about

00:41:20.878 --> 00:41:27.018 region:rollup3
technology that's out there and

00:41:23.147 --> 00:41:29.153 region:rollup3
things that we can --

00:41:24.716 --> 00:41:32.990 region:rollup3
Do now we engaged immediately

00:41:27.018 --> 00:41:34.992 region:rollup3

These kinds of natural disasters

00:41:52.643 --> 00:41:59.017 region:rollup3
and we hired David through could

00:41:54.979 --> 00:42:01.019 region:rollup3
Tony who --

00:41:56.748 --> 00:42:04.856 region:rollup3
To work as a bridge between our

00:41:59.017 --> 00:42:06.858 region:rollup3
group and the county --

00:42:01.019 --> 00:42:08.760 region:rollup3

and former senior official FEMA

00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:14.932 region:rollup3
so he had some real expertise to

00:42:11.195 --> 00:42:17.201 region:rollup3
bring -- To

00:42:12.897 --> 00:42:19.237 region:rollup3

interesting so that I would some

00:43:01.179 --> 00:43:05.149 region:rollup3
more interesting but that didn't

00:43:03.081 --> 00:43:09.120 region:rollup3
work out --

00:43:03.381 --> 00:43:09.687 region:rollup3

you sort of some of the things

00:44:09.413 --> 00:44:15.586 region:rollup3
that we're looking at that we've

00:44:13.117 --> 00:44:17.555 region:rollup3
been discussed with the county

00:44:14.919 --> 00:44:21.159 region:rollup3
and trying to do because really

00:44:15.586 --> 00:44:22.894 region:rollup3
we want to get some mitigation.

00:44:17.555 --> 00:44:23.494 region:rollup3
Up on the mountain.

00:44:21.159 --> 00:44:25.129 region:rollup3
For you know December before the

00:44:22.894 --> 00:44:27.098 region:rollup3
next rains because that's what

00:44:23.494 --> 00:44:29.367 region:rollup3
we're all concerned that we're

00:44:25.129 --> 00:44:33.037 region:rollup3
all concerned about.

00:44:27.098 --> 00:44:33.571 region:rollup3
You know temporary [inaudible]

00:44:29.367 --> 00:44:35.339 region:rollup3
Solutions before that natural re

00:44:33.037 --> 00:44:37.408 region:rollup3
growth can happen on the

00:44:33.571 --> 00:44:41.312 region:rollup3
mountain and some of the on

00:44:35.339 --> 00:44:43.114 region:rollup3
technologies that we're looking

00:44:37.408 --> 00:44:44.882 region:rollup3
at our monitors that can give us

00:44:41.312 --> 00:44:47.084 region:rollup3
real time data about.

00:44:43.114 --> 00:44:51.189 region:rollup3
Things that are happening up on

00:44:44.882 --> 00:44:51.722 region:rollup3
the mountain --

00:44:47.084 --> 00:44:53.191 region:rollup3
One of the technologies that

00:44:51.189 --> 00:44:55.426 region:rollup3
seem to be used around the

00:44:51.722 --> 00:44:59.163 region:rollup3
world.

00:44:53.191 --> 00:44:59.597 region:rollup3
Often and most effectively are

00:44:55.426 --> 00:45:01.465 region:rollup3
debris nets that --

00:44:59.163 --> 00:45:03.301 region:rollup3
I happen to be in.

00:44:59.597 --> 00:45:05.303 region:rollup3
Switzerland for a conference in

00:45:01.465 --> 00:45:08.906 region:rollup3
June and saw them all over the

00:45:03.301 --> 00:45:11.409 region:rollup3
mountains in Switzerland.

00:45:05.303 --> 00:45:13.244 region:rollup3
And that they they actually have

00:45:08.906 --> 00:45:15.279 region:rollup3
saved lots of property and lots

00:45:11.409 --> 00:45:17.081 region:rollup3
of lights around the world so

00:45:13.244 --> 00:45:18.983 region:rollup3
we're looking at doing temporary

00:45:15.279 --> 00:45:21.552 region:rollup3
netting --

00:45:17.081 --> 00:45:23.220 region:rollup3
That is environmentally bed that

00:45:18.983 --> 00:45:25.523 region:rollup3
has been as I said use all over

00:45:21.552 --> 00:45:27.291 region:rollup3
the world and hopefully the

00:45:23.220 --> 00:45:29.060 region:rollup3
first canyon will be able to put

00:45:25.523 --> 00:45:30.895 region:rollup3
Pat and as the Buena Vista

00:45:27.291 --> 00:45:33.164 region:rollup3
canyon because that canyon.

00:45:29.060 --> 00:45:35.233 region:rollup3
Does not have a debris basin at

00:45:30.895 --> 00:45:35.466 region:rollup3
the bottom of it so we're hoping

00:45:33.164 --> 00:45:37.034 region:rollup3
to be able to get this done and

00:45:35.233 --> 00:45:39.036 region:rollup3
again.

00:45:35.466 --> 00:45:39.704 region:rollup3
The county in the state has been

00:45:37.034 --> 00:45:41.472 region:rollup3
so I'm.

00:45:39.036 --> 00:45:43.274 region:rollup3
Working with that hand in hand

00:45:39.704 --> 00:45:47.011 region:rollup3
and try to do everything we

00:45:41.472 --> 00:45:49.080 region:rollup3
could to with they can to get.

00:45:43.274 --> 00:45:51.349 region:rollup3
Sort of emergency stays on you

00:45:47.011 --> 00:45:53.050 region:rollup3
know certain.

00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:57.121 region:rollup3
Approvals we would have to get

00:45:51.349 --> 00:45:59.056 region:rollup3
to do this --

00:45:53.050 --> 00:45:59.357 region:rollup3
In a more permanent way or if we

00:45:57.121 --> 00:46:03.160 region:rollup3
had eternal time to get it done

00:45:59.056 --> 00:46:03.794 region:rollup3
[inaudible]

00:45:59.357 --> 00:46:05.263 region:rollup3
I the other things we're looking

00:46:03.160 --> 00:46:06.964 region:rollup3
at is trying to help the county

00:46:03.794 --> 00:46:07.331 region:rollup3
--

00:46:05.263 --> 00:46:11.068 region:rollup3
Enhance the existing debris base

00:46:06.964 --> 00:46:11.335 region:rollup3
the network --

00:46:07.331 --> 00:46:13.371 region:rollup3
That we have to help accelerate

00:46:11.068 --> 00:46:15.306 region:rollup3
regrowth.

00:46:11.335 --> 00:46:16.941 region:rollup3
And ultimately what we all know

00:46:13.371 --> 00:46:19.577 region:rollup3
is that the entire problem is a

00:46:15.306 --> 00:46:21.512 region:rollup3
water problem.

00:46:16.941 --> 00:46:22.079 region:rollup3
And I know all of mine to see

00:46:19.577 --> 00:46:25.149 region:rollup3
those very focused on really

00:46:21.512 --> 00:46:27.151 region:rollup3
wanting to solve our all of

00:46:22.079 --> 00:46:29.120 region:rollup3
that.

00:46:25.149 --> 00:46:29.754 region:rollup3
State of California.

00:46:27.151 --> 00:46:30.988 region:rollup3
It certainly minus it was very

00:46:29.120 --> 00:46:33.257 region:rollup3
focused on how to solve this

00:46:29.754 --> 00:46:33.791 region:rollup3
problem --

00:46:30.988 --> 00:46:35.159 region:rollup3
And there are many things that

00:46:33.257 --> 00:46:37.528 region:rollup3
we're looking at doing a

00:46:33.791 --> 00:46:41.132 region:rollup3
facilitate better ongoing

00:46:35.159 --> 00:46:41.365 region:rollup3
hydration of the mountain --

00:46:37.528 --> 00:46:41.699 region:rollup3
Certainly if pot growers could

00:46:41.132 --> 00:46:45.703 region:rollup3
do it.

00:46:41.365 --> 00:46:49.040 region:rollup3
We can do it.

00:46:41.699 --> 00:46:49.340 region:rollup3
I I and a so that you know that

00:46:45.703 --> 00:46:51.208 region:rollup3
involves better water catchment

00:46:49.040 --> 00:46:53.210 region:rollup3
[inaudible]

00:46:49.340 --> 00:46:55.413 region:rollup3
Irrigation innovative ways to

00:46:51.208 --> 00:46:59.183 region:rollup3
get water on the mountain --

00:46:53.210 --> 00:47:01.052 region:rollup3
Like things like do harvesting

00:46:55.413 --> 00:47:03.220 region:rollup3
and atmospheric water and other.

00:46:59.183 --> 00:47:03.888 region:rollup3
Things that were just

00:47:01.052 --> 00:47:05.456 region:rollup3
considering because we sort of

00:47:03.220 --> 00:47:06.991 region:rollup3
feel like we are limited only by

00:47:03.888 --> 00:47:09.427 region:rollup3
the boundaries of our

00:47:05.456 --> 00:47:11.362 region:rollup3
imagination.

00:47:06.991 --> 00:47:13.397 region:rollup3
And our imaginations and into

00:47:09.427 --> 00:47:15.599 region:rollup3
the partnerships that were able.

00:47:11.362 --> 00:47:19.003 region:rollup3
To forum and yet one of the

00:47:13.397 --> 00:47:19.570 region:rollup3
groups that I didn't mention who

00:47:15.599 --> 00:47:21.138 region:rollup3
have been so incredibly --

00:47:19.003 --> 00:47:21.806 region:rollup3
Well we all know how amazing

00:47:19.570 --> 00:47:23.407 region:rollup3
that.

00:47:21.138 --> 00:47:27.044 region:rollup3
You no the firefighters and law

00:47:21.806 --> 00:47:29.447 region:rollup3
enforcement in Santa Barbara

00:47:23.407 --> 00:47:31.315 region:rollup3
county have been.

00:47:27.044 --> 00:47:33.317 region:rollup3
Unbelievable heroes in this

00:47:29.447 --> 00:47:33.918 region:rollup3
whole thing and have really

00:47:31.315 --> 00:47:35.419 region:rollup3
stepped outside of I think

00:47:33.317 --> 00:47:37.621 region:rollup3
everyone's stepped outside of

00:47:33.918 --> 00:47:39.557 region:rollup3
their comfort zone and of sort

00:47:35.419 --> 00:47:41.258 region:rollup3
of you know come to the table to

00:47:37.621 --> 00:47:43.427 region:rollup3
have the eager conversations

00:47:39.557 --> 00:47:45.329 region:rollup3
about how everything in pan.

00:47:41.258 --> 00:47:47.198 region:rollup3
Everything else and so we're so

00:47:43.427 --> 00:47:49.133 region:rollup3
grateful to have [inaudible]

00:47:45.329 --> 00:47:51.435 region:rollup3
Such amazing --

00:47:47.198 --> 00:47:57.174 region:rollup3
Leadership --

00:47:49.133 --> 00:47:59.276 region:rollup3
On that front [inaudible]

00:47:51.435 --> 00:48:01.212 region:rollup3
And I think I will.

00:47:57.174 --> 00:48:03.280 region:rollup3
Leave it there except to say

00:47:59.276 --> 00:48:05.116 region:rollup3
that -- You

00:48:01.212 --> 00:48:07.084 region:rollup3
know the habitat.

00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:09.353 region:rollup3
No you in terms of the state we

00:48:05.116 --> 00:48:09.954 region:rollup3
appreciate.

00:48:07.084 --> 00:48:11.222 region:rollup3
Not just everyone's talked about

00:48:09.353 --> 00:48:13.524 region:rollup3
the backfill and I know we're

00:48:09.954 --> 00:48:15.326 region:rollup3
sitting in the auditorium and

00:48:11.222 --> 00:48:17.428 region:rollup3
our school district appreciate

00:48:13.524 --> 00:48:18.062 region:rollup3
so much --

00:48:15.326 --> 00:48:21.399 region:rollup3
The backfill abut the economic

00:48:17.428 --> 00:48:23.300 region:rollup3
implications we know are going

00:48:18.062 --> 00:48:25.269 region:rollup3
to be more than a year.

00:48:21.399 --> 00:48:27.972 region:rollup3
So we're really hoping to find

00:48:23.300 --> 00:48:29.140 region:rollup3
longer term solutions --

00:48:25.269 --> 00:48:31.475 region:rollup3
As the mountain heels and our

00:48:27.972 --> 00:48:33.778 region:rollup3
economy.

00:48:29.140 --> 00:48:37.214 region:rollup3
He'll so thank you for the

Serve a brochure or at the back

00:48:39.583 --> 00:48:45.556 region:rollup3
about what we're doing and we're

00:48:41.285 --> 00:48:47.458 region:rollup3
setting up a website

00:48:43.220 --> 00:48:49.293 region:rollup3
[inaudible] To sort of continue

00:48:45.556 --> 00:48:51.562 region:rollup3
to update with ongoing

00:48:47.458 --> 00:48:55.332 region:rollup3
technologies were looking at and

00:48:49.293 --> 00:48:57.668 region:rollup3
and where.

00:48:51.562 --> 00:48:59.437 region:rollup3
Endeavoring to pursue and we're

00:48:55.332 --> 00:49:00.070 region:rollup3
also doing this with the help of

00:48:57.668 --> 00:49:01.372 region:rollup3
some very generous people in

00:48:59.437 --> 00:49:05.476 region:rollup3
this community who have written

00:49:00.070 --> 00:49:07.378 region:rollup3
some.

00:49:01.372 --> 00:49:09.313 region:rollup3
Very generous chaps to find what

00:49:05.476 --> 00:49:11.282 region:rollup3
we're trying to do so that's

00:49:07.378 --> 00:49:11.916 region:rollup3
kind of the private piece of

00:49:09.313 --> 00:49:15.186 region:rollup3
this partnership is.

00:49:11.282 --> 00:49:15.753 region:rollup3
You know we're trying to pull

00:49:11.916 --> 00:49:19.290 region:rollup3
our personal wait in.

00:49:15.186 --> 00:49:23.394 region:rollup3
Getting us to higher ground

00:49:15.753 --> 00:49:25.596 region:rollup3
thank you.

00:49:19.290 --> 00:49:27.698 region:rollup3
Thank you thank you when.

00:49:23.394 --> 00:49:29.600 region:rollup3
And I. suspected people have

00:49:25.596 --> 00:49:31.168 region:rollup3
some good ideas that you are

00:49:27.698 --> 00:49:33.404 region:rollup3
going your folks are receptive

00:49:29.600 --> 00:49:33.704 region:rollup3
if somebody --

00:49:31.168 --> 00:49:35.439 region:rollup3
Has a suggestion that

00:49:33.404 --> 00:49:37.208 region:rollup3
[inaudible]

00:49:33.704 --> 00:49:37.842 region:rollup3
You might.

00:49:35.439 --> 00:49:41.512 region:rollup3
Interesting considering they

00:49:37.208 --> 00:49:43.147 region:rollup3
could they should come contact

00:49:37.842 --> 00:49:47.117 region:rollup3
you on that as well [inaudible]

00:49:41.512 --> 00:49:49.220 region:rollup3
I'm work.

00:49:43.147 --> 00:49:49.920 region:rollup3
Beyond being receptive we need

00:49:47.117 --> 00:49:51.488 region:rollup3
we have had I named the kind of

00:49:49.220 --> 00:49:52.056 region:rollup3
five or six core members of this

00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:53.357 region:rollup3
group but we have had so much

00:49:51.488 --> 00:49:55.593 region:rollup3
input from members of this

00:49:52.056 --> 00:49:57.495 region:rollup3
community.

00:49:53.357 --> 00:49:59.363 region:rollup3
The resources that we have more

00:49:55.593 --> 00:50:01.632 region:rollup3
than anything in this community

00:49:57.495 --> 00:50:01.832 region:rollup3
our human resources and it is

00:49:59.363 --> 00:50:03.734 region:rollup3
unbelievable the expertise and

00:50:01.632 --> 00:50:05.903 region:rollup3
that.

00:50:01.832 --> 00:50:07.404 region:rollup3
Creative and strategic thinking

00:50:03.734 --> 00:50:09.240 region:rollup3
is going on in this community

00:50:05.903 --> 00:50:09.840 region:rollup3
and the people who have come

00:50:07.404 --> 00:50:11.609 region:rollup3
together to sit with us and help

00:50:09.240 --> 00:50:13.377 region:rollup3
us think these things through

00:50:09.840 --> 00:50:13.944 region:rollup3
and I think I mentioned the

00:50:11.609 --> 00:50:15.579 region:rollup3
ministerial association is one

00:50:13.377 --> 00:50:17.581 region:rollup3
of the groups that's been.

00:50:13.944 --> 00:50:19.517 region:rollup3
So supportive of the work we're

00:50:15.579 --> 00:50:21.285 region:rollup3
doing and wanting to link arms

00:50:17.581 --> 00:50:23.254 region:rollup3
with us and so yes absolutely we

00:50:19.517 --> 00:50:23.554 region:rollup3
are.

00:50:21.285 --> 00:50:25.289 region:rollup3
Beyond open to input

00:50:23.254 --> 00:50:27.391 region:rollup3
[inaudible]

00:50:23.554 --> 00:50:29.760 region:rollup3
Chief.

00:50:25.289 --> 00:50:30.361 region:rollup3
Thank you are pretty being here.

00:50:27.391 --> 00:50:31.362 region:rollup3
If the invitation I've also

00:50:29.760 --> 00:50:35.299 region:rollup3
gained a lot of weight during

00:50:30.361 --> 00:50:37.334 region:rollup3
this whole thing [inaudible]

00:50:31.362 --> 00:50:37.968 region:rollup3
Any consolation.

00:50:35.299 --> 00:50:39.670 region:rollup3
Up I want to talk about.

00:50:37.334 --> 00:50:41.405 region:rollup3
Some things are working in our

00:50:37.968 --> 00:50:41.939 region:rollup3
favor during this whole endeavor

00:50:39.670 --> 00:50:43.340 region:rollup3
some challenges were having

00:50:41.405 --> 00:50:45.276 region:rollup3
moving forward we're gonna

00:50:41.939 --> 00:50:47.778 region:rollup3
continue to have some degree.

00:50:43.340 --> 00:50:49.313 region:rollup3
And a to do list --

00:50:45.276 --> 00:50:51.548 region:rollup3
I'll start with the things

00:50:47.778 --> 00:50:53.350 region:rollup3
working in our favor --

00:50:49.313 --> 00:50:55.886 region:rollup3
I've worked in this organization

00:50:51.548 --> 00:50:57.721 region:rollup3
I lived in pan on my whole life.

00:50:53.350 --> 00:50:59.690 region:rollup3
And I've never seen the fire

00:50:55.886 --> 00:51:01.492 region:rollup3
departments in this up very

00:50:57.721 --> 00:51:02.126 region:rollup3
again along the way.

00:50:59.690 --> 00:51:03.294 region:rollup3
Right now are are her

00:51:01.492 --> 00:51:05.429 region:rollup3
coordination communication with

00:51:02.126 --> 00:51:05.763 region:rollup3
each other --

00:51:03.294 --> 00:51:07.631 region:rollup3
The relationships we have with

00:51:05.429 --> 00:51:09.466 region:rollup3
each other --

00:51:05.763 --> 00:51:10.100 region:rollup3
Honestly has never been better

00:51:07.631 --> 00:51:11.568 region:rollup3
than it is right now and I think

00:51:09.466 --> 00:51:13.470 region:rollup3
some of that is because of the

00:51:10.100 --> 00:51:15.472 region:rollup3
personalities that are involved

00:51:11.568 --> 00:51:16.073 region:rollup3
a lot of it is because and the

00:51:13.470 --> 00:51:17.374 region:rollup3
challenges that we've all had to

00:51:15.472 --> 00:51:19.777 region:rollup3
face together the experiences

00:51:16.073 --> 00:51:21.478 region:rollup3
we've gained.

00:51:17.374 --> 00:51:23.547 region:rollup3
But that is a that's a any part

00:51:19.777 --> 00:51:23.781 region:rollup3
of it too is.

00:51:21.478 --> 00:51:25.416 region:rollup3
Pat McElroy here he was the old

00:51:23.547 --> 00:51:26.083 region:rollup3
city --

00:51:23.781 --> 00:51:26.717 region:rollup3
Citigroup recent retired C. fire

00:51:25.416 --> 00:51:29.586 region:rollup3
chief used to tend bar together

00:51:26.083 --> 00:51:31.522 region:rollup3
that might have some to do with

00:51:26.717 --> 00:51:33.757 region:rollup3
it -- But we

00:51:29.586 --> 00:51:34.391 region:rollup3
have a really good unified --

00:51:31.522 --> 00:51:37.361 region:rollup3
Group of fire chiefs and fire

00:51:33.757 --> 00:51:37.995 region:rollup3
departments here in this county

00:51:34.391 --> 00:51:39.663 region:rollup3
right now --

00:51:37.361 --> 00:51:41.498 region:rollup3
Public private partnerships its

00:51:37.995 --> 00:51:42.066 region:rollup3
partnership for the resulting

00:51:39.663 --> 00:51:43.867 region:rollup3
for resuming communities is is

00:51:41.498 --> 00:51:47.271 region:rollup3
really just an incredible

00:51:42.066 --> 00:51:47.972 region:rollup3
example and very unique to our

00:51:43.867 --> 00:51:49.506 region:rollup3
county --

00:51:47.271 --> 00:51:50.140 region:rollup3
The the the the public sector in

00:51:47.972 --> 00:51:51.542 region:rollup3
the private sector working

00:51:49.506 --> 00:51:53.577 region:rollup3
together and helping each other

00:51:50.140 --> 00:51:54.178 region:rollup3
out -- It's

00:51:51.542 --> 00:51:55.846 region:rollup3
a really encouraging sign when

00:51:53.577 --> 00:51:57.648 region:rollup3
you see things like that to

00:51:54.178 --> 00:51:59.383 region:rollup3
spring up out of nowhere.

00:51:55.846 --> 00:52:01.385 region:rollup3
And I find that to be extremely

00:51:57.648 --> 00:52:03.754 region:rollup3
encouraging --

00:51:59.383 --> 00:52:04.355 region:rollup3
Quick government solutions --

00:52:01.385 --> 00:52:07.591 region:rollup3
Let's face it government

00:52:03.754 --> 00:52:08.125 region:rollup3
typically is not particularly

00:52:04.355 --> 00:52:09.860 region:rollup3
nimble -- We

00:52:07.591 --> 00:52:11.595 region:rollup3
have really nice examples

00:52:08.125 --> 00:52:13.831 region:rollup3
recently of the government

00:52:09.860 --> 00:52:14.431 region:rollup3
acting quickly --

00:52:11.595 --> 00:52:15.699 region:rollup3
To make a real difference is on

00:52:13.831 --> 00:52:17.868 region:rollup3
in the field and on the ground

00:52:14.431 --> 00:52:19.870 region:rollup3
--

00:52:15.699 --> 00:52:21.505 region:rollup3
Senator Jackson's recent effort

00:52:17.868 --> 00:52:23.907 region:rollup3
and and assembly member low

00:52:19.870 --> 00:52:25.876 region:rollup3
moans recent effort --

00:52:21.505 --> 00:52:26.210 region:rollup3
To lobby the governor to add

00:52:23.907 --> 00:52:29.513 region:rollup3
additional monies for the pre

00:52:25.876 --> 00:52:30.147 region:rollup3
positioning.

00:52:26.210 --> 00:52:33.317 region:rollup3
Of fire and EMS resources in

00:52:29.513 --> 00:52:35.853 region:rollup3
front of predicted whether of

00:52:30.147 --> 00:52:36.487 region:rollup3
weather events --

00:52:33.317 --> 00:52:37.755 region:rollup3
Made a major impact on this

00:52:35.853 --> 00:52:39.523 region:rollup3
holiday fire that we recently

00:52:36.487 --> 00:52:41.959 region:rollup3
had just last weekend --

00:52:37.755 --> 00:52:42.593 region:rollup3
We're actually the first --

00:52:39.523 --> 00:52:45.562 region:rollup3
Agent we were the first fire

00:52:41.959 --> 00:52:47.564 region:rollup3
where these funds were utilized

00:52:42.593 --> 00:52:49.633 region:rollup3
--

00:52:45.562 --> 00:52:51.669 region:rollup3
In this unique fashion and we he

00:52:47.564 --> 00:52:53.771 region:rollup3
met the thresholds that were set

00:52:49.633 --> 00:52:55.539 region:rollup3
down by cal fire or or I should

00:52:51.669 --> 00:52:56.206 region:rollup3
also say that our relationship

00:52:53.771 --> 00:52:57.808 region:rollup3
with cal fire with our our

00:52:55.539 --> 00:52:59.643 region:rollup3
federal partners has never been

00:52:56.206 --> 00:53:01.412 region:rollup3
stronger also we have Tom Porter

00:52:57.808 --> 00:53:03.547 region:rollup3
from California with us --

00:52:59.643 --> 00:53:05.749 region:rollup3
We met the thresholds.

00:53:01.412 --> 00:53:06.250 region:rollup3
And we really prepa addition

00:53:03.547 --> 00:53:07.818 region:rollup3
five resources five five fire

00:53:05.749 --> 00:53:09.653 region:rollup3
engines a strike team

00:53:06.250 --> 00:53:10.187 region:rollup3
essentially who would not have

00:53:07.818 --> 00:53:13.691 region:rollup3
had otherwise --

00:53:09.653 --> 00:53:15.426 region:rollup3
Putting at the corner of

00:53:10.187 --> 00:53:17.594 region:rollup3
Hollister and turnpike and they

00:53:13.691 --> 00:53:19.630 region:rollup3
were.

00:53:15.426 --> 00:53:21.598 region:rollup3
There for two hours before the

00:53:17.594 --> 00:53:23.600 region:rollup3
holiday fire broke and they were

00:53:19.630 --> 00:53:25.836 region:rollup3
at work --

00:53:21.598 --> 00:53:27.838 region:rollup3
Read literally within minutes of

00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:28.439 region:rollup3
of of the fire starting so that

00:53:25.836 --> 00:53:31.442 region:rollup3
is an example of government

00:53:27.838 --> 00:53:33.477 region:rollup3
being nimble and making a real

00:53:28.439 --> 00:53:35.546 region:rollup3
--

00:53:31.442 --> 00:53:37.648 region:rollup3
Solid example so we've that I

00:53:33.477 --> 00:53:37.981 region:rollup3
think is extremely courage and

00:53:35.546 --> 00:53:39.750 region:rollup3
we have an engaged community

00:53:37.648 --> 00:53:41.718 region:rollup3
obviously --

00:53:37.981 --> 00:53:42.352 region:rollup3
This monster recovery center

00:53:39.750 --> 00:53:43.487 region:rollup3
that the county is putting out

00:53:41.718 --> 00:53:45.689 region:rollup3
there again I've been here for

00:53:42.352 --> 00:53:46.290 region:rollup3
thirty two years almost.

00:53:43.487 --> 00:53:49.626 region:rollup3
And I was here for the paint

00:53:45.689 --> 00:53:51.595 region:rollup3
fire it was here for he's see

00:53:46.290 --> 00:53:53.664 region:rollup3
that the I don't remember the

00:53:49.626 --> 00:53:55.632 region:rollup3
county being.

00:53:51.595 --> 00:53:57.768 region:rollup3
Leaning this far forward --

00:53:53.664 --> 00:53:59.603 region:rollup3
Connie recovery effort --

00:53:55.632 --> 00:54:01.605 region:rollup3
Ever before and you know part my

00:53:57.768 --> 00:54:02.239 region:rollup3
C. E. O..

00:53:59.603 --> 00:54:03.740 region:rollup3
Mona has given up after staff.

00:54:01.605 --> 00:54:07.478 region:rollup3
She's having to do a lot of met

00:54:02.239 --> 00:54:08.112 region:rollup3
partisans work --

00:54:03.740 --> 00:54:09.580 region:rollup3
Lately --

00:54:07.478 --> 00:54:11.682 region:rollup3
But I I I think those are very

00:54:08.112 --> 00:54:12.282 region:rollup3
encouraging things --

00:54:09.580 --> 00:54:13.617 region:rollup3
So those are good things other

00:54:11.682 --> 00:54:16.153 region:rollup3
challenges were having moving

00:54:12.282 --> 00:54:18.222 region:rollup3
forward.

00:54:13.617 --> 00:54:18.722 region:rollup3
At the most we have about months

00:54:16.153 --> 00:54:21.291 region:rollup3
to do fire prevention and any

00:54:18.222 --> 00:54:21.892 region:rollup3
kind of substantive fuel

00:54:18.722 --> 00:54:25.596 region:rollup3
management --

00:54:21.291 --> 00:54:26.263 region:rollup3
Because of this climate change

00:54:21.892 --> 00:54:27.865 region:rollup3
--

00:54:25.596 --> 00:54:29.833 region:rollup3
We literally just don't have the

00:54:26.263 --> 00:54:31.435 region:rollup3
time that we used to we used to

00:54:27.865 --> 00:54:33.637 region:rollup3
have sort of a semi well defined

00:54:29.833 --> 00:54:35.873 region:rollup3
fire season.

00:54:31.435 --> 00:54:36.540 region:rollup3
Stevo Safar marshals in the back

00:54:33.637 --> 00:54:39.543 region:rollup3
when we came on together when we

00:54:35.873 --> 00:54:40.244 region:rollup3
came on there was a fire season

00:54:36.540 --> 00:54:41.845 region:rollup3
and there was a non fire season.

00:54:39.543 --> 00:54:42.446 region:rollup3
And on fire season is when you

00:54:40.244 --> 00:54:45.616 region:rollup3
get all your training did all

00:54:41.845 --> 00:54:48.085 region:rollup3
your fire your your your fuel

00:54:42.446 --> 00:54:48.719 region:rollup3
management --

00:54:45.616 --> 00:54:50.087 region:rollup3
And we don't have that kind of

00:54:48.085 --> 00:54:51.922 region:rollup3
time anymore and and the I. it

00:54:48.719 --> 00:54:52.556 region:rollup3
my opinion the fire service

00:54:50.087 --> 00:54:55.559 region:rollup3
needs to adapt to that and we're

00:54:51.922 --> 00:54:56.160 region:rollup3
still in the in the process of

00:54:52.556 --> 00:54:58.028 region:rollup3
trying to do that --

00:54:55.559 --> 00:54:59.730 region:rollup3
I should also say that when I

00:54:56.160 --> 00:55:00.364 region:rollup3
speak I'm I'm I'm speaking for

00:54:58.028 --> 00:55:01.732 region:rollup3
all the fire certain not to

00:54:59.730 --> 00:55:05.469 region:rollup3
speaking as a county fire chief

00:55:00.364 --> 00:55:06.103 region:rollup3
we have to pick men here --

00:55:01.732 --> 00:55:07.838 region:rollup3
Kevin Taylor Travis is here from

00:55:05.469 --> 00:55:08.472 region:rollup3
the different from my seat of

00:55:06.103 --> 00:55:11.575 region:rollup3
fire department I I think they

00:55:07.838 --> 00:55:13.911 region:rollup3
all agree with the things that

00:55:08.472 --> 00:55:15.479 region:rollup3
I'm saying --

00:55:11.575 --> 00:55:17.781 region:rollup3
We have a difficult time getting

00:55:13.911 --> 00:55:19.550 region:rollup3
getting this work done because

00:55:15.479 --> 00:55:21.552 region:rollup3
on top of the fact that we're

00:55:17.781 --> 00:55:23.654 region:rollup3
always on fire it seems like --

00:55:19.550 --> 00:55:25.589 region:rollup3
The demand for mutual aid

00:55:21.552 --> 00:55:28.025 region:rollup3
resources out of our county --

00:55:23.654 --> 00:55:29.760 region:rollup3
Is extremely strong --

00:55:25.589 --> 00:55:31.528 region:rollup3
Because we ask for so much help

00:55:28.025 --> 00:55:32.129 region:rollup3
here locally we are duty bound

00:55:29.760 --> 00:55:33.964 region:rollup3
to provide health.

00:55:31.528 --> 00:55:35.866 region:rollup3
Provide Mitchell laid out a

00:55:32.129 --> 00:55:36.466 region:rollup3
county and in fact in this

00:55:33.964 --> 00:55:38.168 region:rollup3
holiday fuller broke we had a

00:55:35.866 --> 00:55:39.536 region:rollup3
strike team out of county and

00:55:36.466 --> 00:55:41.738 region:rollup3
and I think once you have some

00:55:38.168 --> 00:55:45.709 region:rollup3
people out also.

00:55:39.536 --> 00:55:46.310 region:rollup3
So it's really a year round

00:55:41.738 --> 00:55:47.511 region:rollup3
issue that we are still coming

00:55:45.709 --> 00:55:49.780 region:rollup3
to grips with and we have more

00:55:46.310 --> 00:55:51.582 region:rollup3
work to do --

00:55:47.511 --> 00:55:53.684 region:rollup3
We have less time to do

00:55:49.780 --> 00:55:55.686 region:rollup3
environmental review --

00:55:51.582 --> 00:55:56.053 region:rollup3
For fuel management projects --

00:55:53.684 --> 00:55:57.955 region:rollup3
There some misinformation out

00:55:55.686 --> 00:56:00.090 region:rollup3
there that --

00:55:56.053 --> 00:56:01.892 region:rollup3
That I think is proposes didn't

00:55:57.955 --> 00:56:03.627 region:rollup3
used to pose a big challenges it

00:56:00.090 --> 00:56:05.696 region:rollup3
as it does now but it poses a

00:56:01.892 --> 00:56:09.766 region:rollup3
bigger challenge now --

00:56:03.627 --> 00:56:10.300 region:rollup3
Manager burns if you'll breaks.

00:56:05.696 --> 00:56:10.567 region:rollup3
Our our tools that we need at as

00:56:09.766 --> 00:56:13.804 region:rollup3
fire departments and fire

00:56:10.300 --> 00:56:15.672 region:rollup3
fighters.

00:56:10.567 --> 00:56:16.139 region:rollup3
And when and there's

00:56:13.804 --> 00:56:19.476 region:rollup3
misinformation out there about

00:56:15.672 --> 00:56:21.612 region:rollup3
the efficiency of the

00:56:16.139 --> 00:56:22.145 region:rollup3
effectiveness of those tools --

00:56:19.476 --> 00:56:23.580 region:rollup3
Eight makes our job harder and I

00:56:21.612 --> 00:56:25.983 region:rollup3
find it personally affect

00:56:22.145 --> 00:56:27.851 region:rollup3
offense --

00:56:23.580 --> 00:56:29.987 region:rollup3
We would not have been able to

00:56:25.983 --> 00:56:31.588 region:rollup3
stop the Thomas fire --

00:56:27.851 --> 00:56:32.189 region:rollup3
Without the good work that might

00:56:29.987 --> 00:56:33.824 region:rollup3
aceto did providing the fuel

00:56:31.588 --> 00:56:35.792 region:rollup3
breaks in the thinning around

00:56:32.189 --> 00:56:37.694 region:rollup3
the back.

00:56:33.824 --> 00:56:38.295 region:rollup3
Of must feel that is what Scott

00:56:35.792 --> 00:56:41.798 region:rollup3
that fire in another field brick

00:56:37.694 --> 00:56:42.366 region:rollup3
running up to you to Roth road

00:56:38.295 --> 00:56:43.800 region:rollup3
--

00:56:41.798 --> 00:56:45.936 region:rollup3
We could not have put four

00:56:42.366 --> 00:56:46.637 region:rollup3
hundred fire trucks in a

00:56:43.800 --> 00:56:57.047 region:rollup3
thousand firefighters are.

00:56:45.936 --> 00:56:58.215 region:rollup3
More than more more firefighters

00:56:46.637 --> 00:56:58.448 region:rollup3
even then that appear to stop

00:56:57.047 --> 00:56:58.982 region:rollup3
this thing unfortunately we were

00:56:58.215 --> 00:56:59.650 region:rollup3
unable.

00:56:58.448 --> 00:57:00.350 region:rollup3
To save the watershed --

00:56:58.982 --> 00:57:00.884 region:rollup3
Convincing the public that when

00:56:59.650 --> 00:57:01.485 region:rollup3
we say that this is the new

00:57:00.350 --> 00:57:04.154 region:rollup3
normal we really mean --

00:57:00.884 --> 00:57:04.721 region:rollup3
I don't wanna sound gloom and

00:57:01.485 --> 00:57:07.824 region:rollup3
doom but when we say this is the

00:57:04.154 --> 00:57:08.458 region:rollup3
new normal what that really

00:57:04.721 --> 00:57:08.992 region:rollup3
means. To us as firefighters is

00:57:07.824 --> 00:57:10.027 region:rollup3
this is not a hope we're gonna

00:57:08.458 --> 00:57:11.862 region:rollup3
get over this [inaudible]

00:57:08.992 --> 00:57:13.864 region:rollup3
Is [inaudible]

00:57:10.027 --> 00:57:15.832 region:rollup3
Is.

00:57:11.862 --> 00:57:16.533 region:rollup3
This is reality now we're not

00:57:13.864 --> 00:57:18.168 region:rollup3
gonna get over this it's not

00:57:15.832 --> 00:57:19.803 region:rollup3
going to get better and so as a

00:57:16.533 --> 00:57:21.772 region:rollup3
community and as a fire service

00:57:18.168 --> 00:57:25.676 region:rollup3
we need to adapt to that.

00:57:19.803 --> 00:57:26.276 region:rollup3
That's a challenge --

00:57:21.772 --> 00:57:27.744 region:rollup3
Very difficult to coordinate

00:57:25.676 --> 00:57:29.780 region:rollup3
local state and federal land

00:57:26.276 --> 00:57:30.414 region:rollup3
owners --

00:57:27.744 --> 00:57:33.583 region:rollup3
Ranchers farmers the

00:57:29.780 --> 00:57:36.019 region:rollup3
environmental community elected

00:57:30.414 --> 00:57:37.821 region:rollup3
officials --

00:57:33.583 --> 00:57:38.322 region:rollup3
In time to do subsidy fuel

00:57:36.019 --> 00:57:40.190 region:rollup3
management projects really

00:57:37.821 --> 00:57:43.794 region:rollup3
really difficult it was

00:57:38.322 --> 00:57:45.896 region:rollup3
difficult in the old days before

00:57:40.190 --> 00:57:46.430 region:rollup3
it got like it is now --

00:57:43.794 --> 00:57:47.931 region:rollup3
And it's even more difficult now

00:57:45.896 --> 00:57:49.933 region:rollup3
and that's what my whole

00:57:46.430 --> 00:57:52.102 region:rollup3
Mitchell but later here.

00:57:47.931 --> 00:57:53.737 region:rollup3
Learning from history I I I

00:57:49.933 --> 00:57:55.806 region:rollup3
think that we really especially

00:57:52.102 --> 00:57:58.175 region:rollup3
here in Santa Barbara county.

00:57:53.737 --> 00:57:58.642 region:rollup3
We need to learn from history --

00:57:55.806 --> 00:57:59.943 region:rollup3
In nineteen ninety I was I was

00:57:58.175 --> 00:58:02.112 region:rollup3
here three years as a

00:57:58.642 --> 00:58:04.214 region:rollup3
firefighter.

00:57:59.943 --> 00:58:05.782 region:rollup3
And we had the predicate fire

00:58:02.112 --> 00:58:08.118 region:rollup3
and very similar conditions that

00:58:04.214 --> 00:58:09.886 region:rollup3
we had at the holiday fire --

00:58:05.782 --> 00:58:10.487 region:rollup3
What we keep learning is that

00:58:08.118 --> 00:58:12.122 region:rollup3
these fires --

00:58:09.886 --> 00:58:15.726 region:rollup3
They like to start up in the

00:58:10.487 --> 00:58:16.393 region:rollup3
mountains they like to run down

00:58:12.122 --> 00:58:18.195 region:rollup3
in the populated areas --

00:58:15.726 --> 00:58:19.896 region:rollup3
Take homes and kill people they

00:58:16.393 --> 00:58:20.564 region:rollup3
run back up in the hills at

00:58:18.195 --> 00:58:22.332 region:rollup3
night in their run back down the

00:58:19.896 --> 00:58:22.599 region:rollup3
next day it happened during the

00:58:20.564 --> 00:58:24.267 region:rollup3
T. fire happened during his C.

00:58:22.332 --> 00:58:24.935 region:rollup3
to fire.

00:58:22.599 --> 00:58:28.138 region:rollup3
But what is happening now and I

00:58:24.267 --> 00:58:30.207 region:rollup3
think what we really need to be

00:58:24.935 --> 00:58:33.844 region:rollup3
aware of unconscious above is.

00:58:28.138 --> 00:58:35.779 region:rollup3
Interval between those events

00:58:30.207 --> 00:58:36.413 region:rollup3
used to be five to ten years --

00:58:33.844 --> 00:58:38.115 region:rollup3
Now if we get whether.

00:58:35.779 --> 00:58:39.950 region:rollup3
Generally speaking we're gonna

00:58:36.413 --> 00:58:40.450 region:rollup3
get a fire --

00:58:38.115 --> 00:58:41.785 region:rollup3
The interval between those large

00:58:39.950 --> 00:58:45.722 region:rollup3
catastrophic events is

00:58:40.450 --> 00:58:48.024 region:rollup3
increasing.

00:58:41.785 --> 00:58:50.227 region:rollup3
And we need to adapt to that we

00:58:45.722 --> 00:58:51.828 region:rollup3
need to take substantive action.

00:58:48.024 --> 00:58:54.097 region:rollup3
So are here's my here's my to do

00:58:50.227 --> 00:58:56.066 region:rollup3
list.

00:58:51.828 --> 00:58:57.868 region:rollup3
In my opinion we need a

00:58:54.097 --> 00:58:58.535 region:rollup3
countywide I don't know if this

00:58:56.066 --> 00:59:00.170 region:rollup3
is the correct terminology or

00:58:57.868 --> 00:59:00.737 region:rollup3
what we're even gonna call this

00:58:58.535 --> 00:59:01.738 region:rollup3
thing but I believe that we need

00:59:00.170 --> 00:59:03.707 region:rollup3
a countywide fuel management

00:59:00.737 --> 00:59:04.241 region:rollup3
working group.

00:59:01.738 --> 00:59:06.043 region:rollup3
Comprised of all those people

00:59:03.707 --> 00:59:06.576 region:rollup3
that all those members of

00:59:04.241 --> 00:59:07.210 region:rollup3
organizations that I just

00:59:06.043 --> 00:59:09.880 region:rollup3
mentioned that need to be

00:59:06.576 --> 00:59:12.215 region:rollup3
coordinated nor to get any work

00:59:07.210 --> 00:59:12.749 region:rollup3
done -- We

00:59:09.880 --> 00:59:15.852 region:rollup3
need to get those people the

00:59:12.215 --> 00:59:17.854 region:rollup3
environmental community.

00:59:12.749 --> 00:59:20.190 region:rollup3
Elected officials state federal.

00:59:15.852 --> 00:59:21.825 region:rollup3
And local fire agencies.

00:59:17.854 --> 00:59:24.094 region:rollup3
And we need to get planned

00:59:20.190 --> 00:59:24.694 region:rollup3
together with the priority being

00:59:21.825 --> 00:59:26.196 region:rollup3
we need a front country feel

00:59:24.094 --> 00:59:28.532 region:rollup3
break in this in this town we

00:59:24.694 --> 00:59:30.300 region:rollup3
need test [inaudible] To put.

00:59:26.196 --> 00:59:32.068 region:rollup3
Some form of a fuel break that

00:59:28.532 --> 00:59:32.669 region:rollup3
runs from the good work that

00:59:30.300 --> 00:59:35.739 region:rollup3
mocks you already did.

00:59:32.068 --> 00:59:37.741 region:rollup3
Alway out to behind the leader

00:59:32.669 --> 00:59:39.843 region:rollup3
--

00:59:35.739 --> 00:59:41.945 region:rollup3
It can take the form of actual

00:59:37.741 --> 00:59:44.014 region:rollup3
manage actual fuels removed

00:59:39.843 --> 00:59:45.982 region:rollup3
either through hand crews goats

00:59:41.945 --> 00:59:47.918 region:rollup3
a canticle means --

00:59:44.014 --> 00:59:50.020 region:rollup3
Or can take the that form of

00:59:45.982 --> 00:59:50.654 region:rollup3
agriculture --

00:59:47.918 --> 00:59:51.888 region:rollup3
You know I I think there are

00:59:50.020 --> 00:59:56.093 region:rollup3
friends of ours the agriculture

00:59:50.654 --> 00:59:57.994 region:rollup3
community would.

00:59:51.888 --> 00:59:59.930 region:rollup3
You say that but avocados and ag

00:59:56.093 --> 01:00:02.165 region:rollup3
belts.

00:59:57.994 --> 01:00:02.766 region:rollup3
I act as big hit he and they

00:59:59.930 --> 01:00:05.735 region:rollup3
they take up a lot of members

01:00:02.165 --> 01:00:07.971 region:rollup3
you know when we had the sure

01:00:02.766 --> 01:00:08.638 region:rollup3
fire -- The

01:00:05.735 --> 01:00:09.906 region:rollup3
avocado orchards out there when

01:00:07.971 --> 01:00:10.207 region:rollup3
a long way toward saving Toledo

01:00:08.638 --> 01:00:11.942 region:rollup3
from from from catastrophic

01:00:09.906 --> 01:00:14.244 region:rollup3
[inaudible]

01:00:10.207 --> 01:00:16.179 region:rollup3
A loss.

01:00:11.942 --> 01:00:17.881 region:rollup3
So we need to have we need to

01:00:14.244 --> 01:00:18.281 region:rollup3
connect the dots in the front

01:00:16.179 --> 01:00:20.383 region:rollup3
country or we are just going to

01:00:17.881 --> 01:00:21.985 region:rollup3
be in my opinion.

01:00:18.281 --> 01:00:22.619 region:rollup3
Fits with this problem over and

01:00:20.383 --> 01:00:28.024 region:rollup3
over again it's a heavy lift --

01:00:21.985 --> 01:00:28.325 region:rollup3
There's a lot of assets there's

01:00:22.619 --> 01:00:30.360 region:rollup3
a lot of there's a lot of apple

01:00:28.024 --> 01:00:32.329 region:rollup3
carts that.

01:00:28.325 --> 01:00:35.966 region:rollup3
That a will be upset in the

01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:38.101 region:rollup3
process but I think until we do

01:00:32.329 --> 01:00:39.870 region:rollup3
something are on that scale.

01:00:35.966 --> 01:00:40.504 region:rollup3
We are going to continue C.

01:00:38.101 --> 01:00:42.072 region:rollup3
these problems and finally I

01:00:39.870 --> 01:00:43.907 region:rollup3
have to throw this in there we

01:00:40.504 --> 01:00:46.309 region:rollup3
need to unify our dispatch

01:00:42.072 --> 01:00:47.978 region:rollup3
services in this county --

01:00:43.907 --> 01:00:50.213 region:rollup3
Right now in this county we have

01:00:46.309 --> 01:00:52.215 region:rollup3
five dispatch centers.

01:00:47.978 --> 01:00:54.017 region:rollup3
It's not unified we respond on

01:00:50.213 --> 01:00:56.019 region:rollup3
most of the time different

01:00:52.215 --> 01:00:56.686 region:rollup3
frequencies it creates problems

01:00:54.017 --> 01:01:00.157 region:rollup3
for us on small scale bird to

01:00:56.019 --> 01:01:00.757 region:rollup3
seize and particularly in large

01:00:56.686 --> 01:01:01.992 region:rollup3
scale emergencies --

01:01:00.157 --> 01:01:04.160 region:rollup3
During the debris flow during

01:01:00.757 --> 01:01:06.296 region:rollup3
the Thomas fire.

01:01:01.992 --> 01:01:07.998 region:rollup3
We had difficulties because we

01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:10.200 region:rollup3
were not responding on the same

01:01:06.296 --> 01:01:10.800 region:rollup3
frequency oftentimes we what are

01:01:07.998 --> 01:01:11.101 region:rollup3
our mobile data computers are

01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:11.902 region:rollup3
fire trucks once in the scene

01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:14.137 region:rollup3
[inaudible]

01:01:11.101 --> 01:01:16.306 region:rollup3
Thing.

01:01:11.902 --> 01:01:17.908 region:rollup3
So situational awareness that

01:01:14.137 --> 01:01:20.443 region:rollup3
responding resources had going

01:01:16.306 --> 01:01:20.911 region:rollup3
in these large incidents was not

01:01:17.908 --> 01:01:23.914 region:rollup3
as good as it could have been

01:01:20.443 --> 01:01:25.882 region:rollup3
and it's a problem.

01:01:20.911 --> 01:01:27.984 region:rollup3
We are far too forward thinking.

01:01:23.914 --> 01:01:28.585 region:rollup3
Of accounting and of a community

01:01:25.882 --> 01:01:30.420 region:rollup3
to have an unified dispatching

01:01:27.984 --> 01:01:30.754 region:rollup3
environment is something we

01:01:28.585 --> 01:01:32.389 region:rollup3
absolute need to fix I'm working

01:01:30.420 --> 01:01:34.157 region:rollup3
my C. Yom --

01:01:30.754 --> 01:01:34.791 region:rollup3
Monning Misato dust Williams

01:01:32.389 --> 01:01:36.393 region:rollup3
just left there where the

01:01:34.157 --> 01:01:38.128 region:rollup3
problem we're looking at active

01:01:34.791 --> 01:01:40.096 region:rollup3
--

01:01:36.393 --> 01:01:41.898 region:rollup3
Solutions met Pontus is part of

01:01:38.128 --> 01:01:44.234 region:rollup3
the part of the team --

01:01:40.096 --> 01:01:44.901 region:rollup3
But that's a big one on the to

01:01:41.898 --> 01:01:46.136 region:rollup3
do list facing these major

01:01:44.234 --> 01:01:46.736 region:rollup3
catastrophes as we move forward.

01:01:44.901 --> 01:01:54.077 region:rollup3
Thank you thank you chief we've

01:01:46.136 --> 01:01:54.611 region:rollup3
written it down both of us so

01:01:46.736 --> 01:01:55.178 region:rollup3
thank you.

01:01:54.077 --> 01:01:58.148 region:rollup3
And so people aren't to

01:01:54.611 --> 01:01:58.815 region:rollup3
discourage we are actually

01:01:55.178 --> 01:01:59.449 region:rollup3
moving on those --

01:01:58.148 --> 01:02:02.018 region:rollup3
Levels and we'll talk about that

01:01:58.815 --> 01:02:04.154 region:rollup3
a little later thank you and now

01:01:59.449 --> 01:02:04.754 region:rollup3
--

01:02:02.018 --> 01:02:06.489 region:rollup3
Katie dedicate which you share

01:02:04.154 --> 01:02:08.191 region:rollup3
with us what's going on if you

01:02:04.754 --> 01:02:08.792 region:rollup3
could keep it under ten minutes

01:02:06.489 --> 01:02:11.928 region:rollup3
at a great camp.

01:02:08.191 --> 01:02:13.997 region:rollup3
I I'm Kate we be I am the

01:02:08.792 --> 01:02:14.431 region:rollup3
director of the institute for

01:02:11.928 --> 01:02:18.235 region:rollup3
collective trauma and growth.

01:02:13.997 --> 01:02:20.303 region:rollup3
And we have been --

01:02:14.431 --> 01:02:22.072 region:rollup3
Working for years now and asters

01:02:18.235 --> 01:02:24.174 region:rollup3
and long term I. recovery

01:02:20.303 --> 01:02:25.976 region:rollup3
efforts around the country and

01:02:22.072 --> 01:02:30.080 region:rollup3
we happen to be based here and

01:02:24.174 --> 01:02:30.680 region:rollup3
so were immediately responsive

01:02:25.976 --> 01:02:32.148 region:rollup3
and and created a local project

01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:32.682 region:rollup3
that we're calling the revere

01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:33.917 region:rollup3
care center and we set up

01:02:32.148 --> 01:02:36.353 region:rollup3
offices in the monocyte of

01:02:32.682 --> 01:02:38.121 region:rollup3
Skinner.

01:02:33.917 --> 01:02:40.557 region:rollup3
And I also serve as the long

01:02:36.353 --> 01:02:42.392 region:rollup3
term recovery I. group chair.

01:02:38.121 --> 01:02:44.227 region:rollup3
And so in that role I've been

01:02:40.557 --> 01:02:46.229 region:rollup3
working very closely with Ben

01:02:42.392 --> 01:02:48.031 region:rollup3
Romano and other county

01:02:44.227 --> 01:02:49.1000 region:rollup3
representatives and especially

01:02:46.229 --> 01:02:52.002 region:rollup3
as we've seen how --

01:02:48.031 --> 01:02:54.437 region:rollup3
Helpful and successful the

01:02:49.1000 --> 01:02:56.239 region:rollup3
Montesinos center has been --

01:02:52.002 --> 01:02:56.940 region:rollup3
This collaborative effort has

01:02:54.437 --> 01:02:58.341 region:rollup3
really --

01:02:56.239 --> 01:03:00.410 region:rollup3
And and the hub that Matt talked

01:02:56.940 --> 01:03:02.245 region:rollup3
about has really helped to

01:02:58.341 --> 01:03:04.381 region:rollup3
create kind of a one stop shop

01:03:00.410 --> 01:03:06.249 region:rollup3
that people could go to for the

01:03:02.245 --> 01:03:07.984 region:rollup3
wide range of it's that --

01:03:04.381 --> 01:03:10.287 region:rollup3
Are part of the long term

01:03:06.249 --> 01:03:12.289 region:rollup3
recovery effort.

01:03:07.984 --> 01:03:14.157 region:rollup3
And so that this collaboration

01:03:10.287 --> 01:03:14.457 region:rollup3
is not going to end anytime soon

01:03:12.289 --> 01:03:16.493 region:rollup3
and we'll be together at least

01:03:14.157 --> 01:03:18.294 region:rollup3
through --

01:03:14.457 --> 01:03:20.363 region:rollup3
The next evacuation season so at

01:03:16.493 --> 01:03:22.132 region:rollup3
least through March and we have

01:03:18.294 --> 01:03:22.732 region:rollup3
started conversations --

01:03:20.363 --> 01:03:24.234 region:rollup3
About the possibility of

01:03:22.132 --> 01:03:26.603 region:rollup3
remaining in the same location

01:03:22.732 --> 01:03:30.140 region:rollup3
--

01:03:24.234 --> 01:03:32.175 region:rollup3
As we are right now and so if

01:03:26.603 --> 01:03:34.177 region:rollup3
that changes at all we will for

01:03:30.140 --> 01:03:36.179 region:rollup3
sure update the public --

01:03:32.175 --> 01:03:38.181 region:rollup3
As soon as possible --

01:03:34.177 --> 01:03:40.250 region:rollup3
And right now some of that the

01:03:36.179 --> 01:03:42.485 region:rollup3
reason that we are forecasting

01:03:38.181 --> 01:03:44.087 region:rollup3
that way is because while the

01:03:40.250 --> 01:03:46.189 region:rollup3
modesty of center was effective

01:03:42.485 --> 01:03:48.258 region:rollup3
immediately --

01:03:44.087 --> 01:03:50.093 region:rollup3
Everyone processes trauma and

01:03:46.189 --> 01:03:52.195 region:rollup3
goes through their own --

01:03:48.258 --> 01:03:54.397 region:rollup3
Sense of disaster at their pace

01:03:50.093 --> 01:03:56.199 region:rollup3
and so while many people --

01:03:52.195 --> 01:03:56.766 region:rollup3
Sought out resources right away

01:03:54.397 --> 01:04:00.036 region:rollup3
they're people who are just

01:03:56.199 --> 01:04:00.670 region:rollup3
starting to come to seek out

01:03:56.766 --> 01:04:02.005 region:rollup3
services right now.

01:04:00.036 --> 01:04:02.572 region:rollup3
They're just starting to realize

01:04:00.670 --> 01:04:04.541 region:rollup3
--

01:04:02.005 --> 01:04:08.311 region:rollup3
That maybe they weren't --

01:04:02.572 --> 01:04:10.246 region:rollup3
As insured as they thought they

01:04:04.541 --> 01:04:12.615 region:rollup3
were or or their rebuilding

01:04:08.311 --> 01:04:14.150 region:rollup3
efforts are costing.

01:04:10.246 --> 01:04:16.519 region:rollup3
They're just starting to feel

01:04:12.615 --> 01:04:18.221 region:rollup3
some of the impacts of the

01:04:14.150 --> 01:04:20.223 region:rollup3
motion on and spiritual and

01:04:16.519 --> 01:04:22.592 region:rollup3
psychological impacts --

01:04:18.221 --> 01:04:24.260 region:rollup3
They're just starting --

01:04:20.223 --> 01:04:26.129 region:rollup3
To recognize some of the longer

01:04:22.592 --> 01:04:28.064 region:rollup3
term impacts on their businesses

01:04:24.260 --> 01:04:28.732 region:rollup3
and so -- We

01:04:26.129 --> 01:04:34.471 region:rollup3
have services at Montesinos

01:04:28.064 --> 01:04:36.206 region:rollup3

touched on wear a through the

01:06:22.545 --> 01:06:26.783 region:rollup3
legislative action and the

01:06:24.481 --> 01:06:30.453 region:rollup3

points have been made --

01:06:36.292 --> 01:06:40.730 region:rollup3
In terms of how the some of the

01:06:38.461 --> 01:06:42.298 region:rollup3

the governor to support --

01:06:42.298 --> 01:06:46.936 region:rollup3
Resource deployments ahead of

01:06:44.601 --> 01:06:48.538 region:rollup3
them it's as well as to look at

01:06:46.469 --> 01:06:50.573 region:rollup3
hazard mitigation --

01:06:46.936 --> 01:06:50.840 region:rollup3
We've certainly at the

01:06:48.538 --> 01:06:54.344 region:rollup3

01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:58.248 region:rollup3
Learned a tremendous amount --

01:06:54.344 --> 01:07:00.283 region:rollup3
Through the events of twenty

01:06:56.479 --> 01:07:00.884 region:rollup3
seventeen obviously here first

01:06:58.248 --> 01:07:02.418 region:rollup3

01:07:00.884 --> 01:07:06.322 region:rollup3
But unfortunately across

01:07:02.418 --> 01:07:08.391 region:rollup3
California twenty seventeen was

01:07:04.387 --> 01:07:10.393 region:rollup3
a really catastrophic year from.

01:07:06.322 --> 01:07:10.927 region:rollup3
The significant flooding events

01:07:08.391 --> 01:07:12.896 region:rollup3
we had throughout California at

01:07:10.393 --> 01:07:14.530 region:rollup3
the beginning the year.

01:07:10.927 --> 01:07:16.466 region:rollup3
Our crisis at the Oroville lake

throughout California we lost

01:07:24.307 --> 01:07:28.378 region:rollup3
eleven thousand homes and

01:07:24.841 --> 01:07:28.845 region:rollup3

01:07:26.342 --> 01:07:29.445 region:rollup3

this region in supporting the

01:07:44.394 --> 01:07:49.098 region:rollup3

during the Tom spire.

01:08:04.380 --> 01:08:09.118 region:rollup3
No what we've realizes there's

01:08:06.349 --> 01:08:10.486 region:rollup3
tremendous success based on the

01:08:08.484 --> 01:08:12.388 region:rollup3
partnerships of local state and

01:08:09.118 --> 01:08:13.022 region:rollup3

To and as we've --

01:08:33.009 --> 01:08:38.748 region:rollup3
Worked to ensure that there's an

01:08:34.777 --> 01:08:40.450 region:rollup3
expeditious flow of federal and

01:08:36.980 --> 01:08:41.150 region:rollup3
state dollars for those recovery

01:08:38.748 --> 01:08:42.819 region:rollup3
efforts.

01:08:40.450 --> 01:08:45.088 region:rollup3
You were working on what can we

01:08:41.150 --> 01:08:46.422 region:rollup3
do better to be --

01:08:42.819 --> 01:08:48.624 region:rollup3
Better prepared for that next to

01:08:45.088 --> 01:08:50.426 region:rollup3

01:08:50.660 --> 01:08:58.701 region:rollup3
Earlier this year after the

01:08:52.762 --> 01:08:59.302 region:rollup3
catastrophic debris flow when we

01:08:56.532 --> 01:09:00.870 region:rollup3
saw additional events coming in

01:08:58.701 --> 01:09:02.472 region:rollup3
additional weather events --

01:08:59.302 --> 01:09:04.507 region:rollup3
We actually did something we've

01:09:00.870 --> 01:09:06.709 region:rollup3
never done before we pre

01:09:02.472 --> 01:09:08.511 region:rollup3
positioned recovery resources --

01:09:04.507 --> 01:09:10.646 region:rollup3
We mobilize a state agency

01:09:06.709 --> 01:09:11.014 region:rollup3
experts from the department of

01:09:08.511 --> 01:09:12.548 region:rollup3
water resources and Caltrans and

01:09:10.646 --> 01:09:14.417 region:rollup3
other agencies.

01:09:11.014 --> 01:09:14.984 region:rollup3
As well as we pass the federal

01:09:12.548 --> 01:09:18.521 region:rollup3
government with mobilizing the

01:09:14.417 --> 01:09:19.155 region:rollup3
US army corps of engineer

01:09:14.984 --> 01:09:20.289 region:rollup3
contractors in the event that we

01:09:18.521 --> 01:09:22.358 region:rollup3
had another event like the one

01:09:19.155 --> 01:09:24.594 region:rollup3
nine flow.

01:09:20.289 --> 01:09:25.194 region:rollup3
So that we could expeditiously

01:09:22.358 --> 01:09:26.496 region:rollup3
get in there and clean up debris

01:09:24.594 --> 01:09:28.698 region:rollup3
and get the community back on

01:09:25.194 --> 01:09:30.867 region:rollup3
its feet fortunately.

01:09:26.496 --> 01:09:31.434 region:rollup3
Those storms did manifest the

01:09:28.698 --> 01:09:32.635 region:rollup3
way we thought they were going

01:09:30.867 --> 01:09:34.637 region:rollup3
to but we were per aired for

01:09:31.434 --> 01:09:36.506 region:rollup3
that --

01:09:32.635 --> 01:09:38.508 region:rollup3
Additionally --

01:09:34.637 --> 01:09:40.743 region:rollup3
As we saw most recently.

01:09:36.506 --> 01:09:42.979 region:rollup3
With the fires last week.

01:09:38.508 --> 01:09:44.647 region:rollup3
I'm we had the ability --

01:09:40.743 --> 01:09:46.416 region:rollup3
Through additional funding in

01:09:42.979 --> 01:09:48.618 region:rollup3
legislation that have been

01:09:44.647 --> 01:09:50.386 region:rollup3
authorized to pre position

01:09:46.416 --> 01:09:52.855 region:rollup3
critical resources to support

01:09:48.618 --> 01:09:54.957 region:rollup3
Santa Barbara county --

01:09:50.386 --> 01:09:56.726 region:rollup3
As was noted we had. Twenty five

01:09:52.855 --> 01:09:57.360 region:rollup3
million dollars in funding

01:09:54.957 --> 01:09:58.861 region:rollup3
statewide --

01:09:56.726 --> 01:10:00.530 region:rollup3
We have the ability now to pre

01:09:57.360 --> 01:10:00.830 region:rollup3
positioning coordination with

01:09:58.861 --> 01:10:02.665 region:rollup3
cal fire and local partners

01:10:00.530 --> 01:10:02.965 region:rollup3
[inaudible]

01:10:00.830 --> 01:10:06.436 region:rollup3
Critical resource.

01:10:02.665 --> 01:10:07.003 region:rollup3
Critical --

01:10:02.965 --> 01:10:10.540 region:rollup3
Firefighting response resources

01:10:06.436 --> 01:10:11.174 region:rollup3
as well as other M. Nancy

01:10:07.003 --> 01:10:12.842 region:rollup3
management resources --

01:10:10.540 --> 01:10:14.977 region:rollup3
To be prepared when we've got

01:10:11.174 --> 01:10:16.813 region:rollup3
events that meet the critical --

01:10:12.842 --> 01:10:18.848 region:rollup3
Whether in other threshold

01:10:14.977 --> 01:10:20.550 region:rollup3
factors that are considered we

01:10:16.813 --> 01:10:22.585 region:rollup3
had five of Callaway esses

01:10:18.848 --> 01:10:23.186 region:rollup3
engines here Hannah Barbara as

01:10:20.550 --> 01:10:24.654 region:rollup3
noted.

01:10:22.585 --> 01:10:26.656 region:rollup3
Those engines were [inaudible]

01:10:23.186 --> 01:10:27.156 region:rollup3
Holiday fire [inaudible]

01:10:24.654 --> 01:10:28.491 region:rollup3
Time we had six local

01:10:26.656 --> 01:10:30.827 region:rollup3
governments [inaudible]

01:10:27.156 --> 01:10:32.862 region:rollup3
Directing.

01:10:28.491 --> 01:10:34.597 region:rollup3
Positioned in Los Angeles some

01:10:30.827 --> 01:10:35.231 region:rollup3
of those engines and it up

01:10:32.862 --> 01:10:37.033 region:rollup3
getting deployed.

01:10:34.597 --> 01:10:38.501 region:rollup3
An additional response up here

01:10:35.231 --> 01:10:39.135 region:rollup3
in in because of the the funding

01:10:37.033 --> 01:10:40.837 region:rollup3
that was available in the

01:10:38.501 --> 01:10:42.572 region:rollup3
program that's in place we're

01:10:39.135 --> 01:10:46.476 region:rollup3
able to back fill those in the

01:10:40.837 --> 01:10:48.578 region:rollup3
event that it [inaudible]

01:10:42.572 --> 01:10:50.713 region:rollup3
Significant fire a broken in Los

01:10:46.476 --> 01:10:52.582 region:rollup3
Angeles during that time --

01:10:48.578 --> 01:10:53.216 region:rollup3
We were also fortunate during

01:10:50.713 --> 01:10:53.349 region:rollup3
the holiday fire to the federal

01:10:52.582 --> 01:10:54.951 region:rollup3
fire management assistance grant

01:10:53.216 --> 01:10:56.753 region:rollup3
--

01:10:53.349 --> 01:10:57.286 region:rollup3
It's probably the fastest

01:10:54.951 --> 01:10:58.588 region:rollup3
approval I've ever seen --

01:10:56.753 --> 01:11:02.692 region:rollup3
For a FEMA fire management

01:10:57.286 --> 01:11:04.827 region:rollup3
assist [inaudible]

01:10:58.588 --> 01:11:06.829 region:rollup3
And all [inaudible]

01:11:02.692 --> 01:11:10.733 region:rollup3
Very fortunate [inaudible]

01:11:04.827 --> 01:11:11.033 region:rollup3
Federal government [inaudible]

01:11:06.829 --> 01:11:12.735 region:rollup3
On while we've been working

01:11:10.733 --> 01:11:14.570 region:rollup3
[inaudible]

01:11:11.033 --> 01:11:16.672 region:rollup3
Fireside [inaudible]

01:11:12.735 --> 01:11:20.676 region:rollup3
Need.

01:11:14.570 --> 01:11:21.244 region:rollup3
Ahead of the Vance.

01:11:16.672 --> 01:11:21.577 region:rollup3
We all can in your work.

01:11:20.676 --> 01:11:26.449 region:rollup3
Developing standards at the

01:11:21.244 --> 01:11:26.749 region:rollup3
state level.

01:11:21.577 --> 01:11:28.885 region:rollup3
I know there's legislation

01:11:26.449 --> 01:11:30.787 region:rollup3
[inaudible]

01:11:26.749 --> 01:11:31.254 region:rollup3
Centered we're trying to be

01:11:28.885 --> 01:11:34.590 region:rollup3
ahead of that by developing

01:11:30.787 --> 01:11:35.091 region:rollup3
standards [inaudible]

01:11:31.254 --> 01:11:36.726 region:rollup3
That can.

01:11:34.590 --> 01:11:39.061 region:rollup3
Coincide with whatever

01:11:35.091 --> 01:11:41.030 region:rollup3
legislation gets passed --

01:11:36.726 --> 01:11:42.999 region:rollup3
We've formed a committee --

01:11:39.061 --> 01:11:44.667 region:rollup3
That's developed on a draft

01:11:41.030 --> 01:11:46.802 region:rollup3
recommendations on that are

01:11:42.999 --> 01:11:48.704 region:rollup3
currently under review that that

01:11:44.667 --> 01:11:50.673 region:rollup3
will establish a standard.

01:11:46.802 --> 01:11:51.007 region:rollup3
Eighteen a base level for all

01:11:48.704 --> 01:11:52.675 region:rollup3
alert warning throughout

01:11:50.673 --> 01:11:56.579 region:rollup3
California --

01:11:51.007 --> 01:11:57.213 region:rollup3
That we can --

01:11:52.675 --> 01:12:00.683 region:rollup3
Uses a model especially help

01:11:56.579 --> 01:12:01.284 region:rollup3
jurisdictions that aren't as

01:11:57.213 --> 01:12:01.484 region:rollup3
robust in terms of alert warning

01:12:00.683 --> 01:12:03.052 region:rollup3
and Santa Barbara and Ventura

01:12:01.284 --> 01:12:04.754 region:rollup3
are.

01:12:01.484 --> 01:12:06.956 region:rollup3
So lot of lessons are being

01:12:03.052 --> 01:12:07.356 region:rollup3
learned and best practices being

01:12:04.754 --> 01:12:08.558 region:rollup3
you realize that we've been

01:12:06.956 --> 01:12:10.693 region:rollup3
seeing down here.

01:12:07.356 --> 01:12:11.194 region:rollup3
The final --

01:12:08.558 --> 01:12:12.895 region:rollup3
Areas all touch on that Matt

01:12:10.693 --> 01:12:14.697 region:rollup3
touched on earlier --

01:12:11.194 --> 01:12:15.298 region:rollup3
Is the state hazard mitigation

01:12:12.895 --> 01:12:17.099 region:rollup3
grant funding --

01:12:14.697 --> 01:12:19.168 region:rollup3
There's a program after every

01:12:15.298 --> 01:12:20.536 region:rollup3
major a presidential disaster

01:12:17.099 --> 01:12:22.872 region:rollup3
where 20% of the overall cost of

01:12:19.168 --> 01:12:25.007 region:rollup3
that disaster.

01:12:20.536 --> 01:12:27.176 region:rollup3
Gets applied to additional

01:12:22.872 --> 01:12:28.644 region:rollup3
funding that's allocated to the

01:12:25.007 --> 01:12:31.280 region:rollup3
state. To provide funding grants

01:12:27.176 --> 01:12:34.550 region:rollup3
to local governments to take

01:12:28.644 --> 01:12:34.851 region:rollup3
steps to mitigate future losses

01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:35.484 region:rollup3
future disasters.

01:12:34.550 --> 01:12:37.053 region:rollup3
Although --

01:12:34.851 --> 01:12:40.489 region:rollup3
This funding is driven by fires

01:12:35.484 --> 01:12:41.057 region:rollup3
--

01:12:37.053 --> 01:12:42.725 region:rollup3
The grants themselves apply for

01:12:40.489 --> 01:12:43.025 region:rollup3
flood mitigation for fire

01:12:41.057 --> 01:12:44.794 region:rollup3
mitigation for earthquake

01:12:42.725 --> 01:12:46.729 region:rollup3
[inaudible]

01:12:43.025 --> 01:12:48.931 region:rollup3
Across California.

01:12:44.794 --> 01:12:50.1000 region:rollup3
Through the October disasters

01:12:46.729 --> 01:12:51.634 region:rollup3
and December does a disaster if

01:12:48.931 --> 01:12:52.702 region:rollup3
three and seventy one million

01:12:50.1000 --> 01:12:54.737 region:rollup3
dollars here in Santa Barbara

01:12:51.634 --> 01:12:55.371 region:rollup3
county.

01:12:52.702 --> 01:12:56.973 region:rollup3
There been --

01:12:54.737 --> 01:12:58.574 region:rollup3
Fifty nine Wilk what's called

01:12:55.371 --> 01:12:59.208 region:rollup3
notice of interests that have

01:12:56.973 --> 01:13:00.910 region:rollup3
been submitted to us we've

01:12:58.574 --> 01:13:02.912 region:rollup3
approved fifty of those in the

01:12:59.208 --> 01:13:04.914 region:rollup3
counties now working.

01:13:00.910 --> 01:13:06.782 region:rollup3
On many of those to submit

01:13:02.912 --> 01:13:07.416 region:rollup3
applications to us and so will

01:13:04.914 --> 01:13:09.018 region:rollup3
continue to provide subject

01:13:06.782 --> 01:13:10.987 region:rollup3
matter expertise to them as they

01:13:07.416 --> 01:13:11.254 region:rollup3
work through that grant

01:13:09.018 --> 01:13:12.889 region:rollup3
development process and look

01:13:10.987 --> 01:13:14.690 region:rollup3
forward.

01:13:11.254 --> 01:13:16.726 region:rollup3
To as some of those actions

01:13:12.889 --> 01:13:18.694 region:rollup3
being implemented from flood

01:13:14.690 --> 01:13:19.028 region:rollup3
mitigation measures that that.

01:13:16.726 --> 01:13:21.130 region:rollup3
That Matt touched on to fire

01:13:18.694 --> 01:13:23.032 region:rollup3
clearance --

01:13:19.028 --> 01:13:23.332 region:rollup3
Efforts on another flood control

01:13:21.130 --> 01:13:26.736 region:rollup3
measures that will greatly

01:13:23.032 --> 01:13:28.871 region:rollup3
enhance --

01:13:23.332 --> 01:13:29.472 region:rollup3
The ability to reduce low.

01:13:26.736 --> 01:13:36.746 region:rollup3
So I think you very much for

01:13:28.871 --> 01:13:40.583 region:rollup3
allowing us to be here today.

01:13:29.472 --> 01:13:42.718 region:rollup3
Think.

01:13:36.746 --> 01:13:44.921 region:rollup3
And upfront thank you.

01:13:40.583 --> 01:13:47.023 region:rollup3
I thought senator Jackson and

01:13:42.718 --> 01:13:48.824 region:rollup3
assembly a member of the Monning

01:13:44.921 --> 01:13:51.127 region:rollup3
for having us here --

01:13:47.023 --> 01:13:53.029 region:rollup3
I think this could be the the

01:13:48.824 --> 01:13:54.964 region:rollup3
panel of we're from the state

01:13:51.127 --> 01:13:57.066 region:rollup3
we're here to help --

01:13:53.029 --> 01:13:58.668 region:rollup3
And Hannah I I I I see that with

01:13:54.964 --> 01:14:01.003 region:rollup3
a little bit of a joke in my

01:13:57.066 --> 01:14:02.738 region:rollup3
voice --

01:13:58.668 --> 01:14:06.842 region:rollup3
Only because we that truly is

01:14:01.003 --> 01:14:08.778 region:rollup3
what were best --

01:14:02.738 --> 01:14:09.045 region:rollup3
Here to do is help your local --

01:14:06.842 --> 01:14:10.646 region:rollup3
Government officials and your

01:14:08.778 --> 01:14:13.249 region:rollup3
local --

01:14:09.045 --> 01:14:14.684 region:rollup3
Departments --

01:14:10.646 --> 01:14:18.788 region:rollup3
To recover from what you've been

01:14:13.249 --> 01:14:20.856 region:rollup3
through --

01:14:14.684 --> 01:14:22.792 region:rollup3
And I I I don't think it's lost

01:14:18.788 --> 01:14:24.860 region:rollup3
on any of you that that the

01:14:20.856 --> 01:14:25.227 region:rollup3
frequency is --

01:14:22.792 --> 01:14:26.796 region:rollup3
Has increased --

01:14:24.860 --> 01:14:28.998 region:rollup3
Dramatically --

01:14:25.227 --> 01:14:29.632 region:rollup3
Here in the front country of

01:14:26.796 --> 01:14:30.766 region:rollup3
Santa Barbara county it's

01:14:28.998 --> 01:14:33.135 region:rollup3
increased in your back country

01:14:29.632 --> 01:14:34.904 region:rollup3
as well --

01:14:30.766 --> 01:14:35.204 region:rollup3
You've had more fires in the

01:14:33.135 --> 01:14:38.607 region:rollup3
last -- Five

01:14:34.904 --> 01:14:40.743 region:rollup3
years -- On

01:14:35.204 --> 01:14:44.880 region:rollup3
average then --

01:14:38.607 --> 01:14:45.314 region:rollup3
In the period that long.

01:14:40.743 --> 01:14:47.283 region:rollup3
Or that of of that length --

01:14:44.880 --> 01:14:48.951 region:rollup3
In the past so --

01:14:45.314 --> 01:14:50.653 region:rollup3
Santa Barbara's not unlike the

01:14:47.283 --> 01:14:52.755 region:rollup3
rest of the state --

01:14:48.951 --> 01:14:54.924 region:rollup3
As senator Jackson Jackson

01:14:50.653 --> 01:14:56.926 region:rollup3
mentioned --

01:14:52.755 --> 01:14:58.728 region:rollup3
The climate change is changing

01:14:54.924 --> 01:15:01.230 region:rollup3
the fire environment and in

01:14:56.926 --> 01:15:04.767 region:rollup3
general --

01:14:58.728 --> 01:15:07.336 region:rollup3
It can be said no matter where

01:15:01.230 --> 01:15:08.904 region:rollup3
you are in California --

01:15:04.767 --> 01:15:11.207 region:rollup3
Every acre can and will burn at

01:15:07.336 --> 01:15:13.142 region:rollup3
some point.

01:15:08.904 --> 01:15:14.744 region:rollup3
And we're just seeing more

01:15:11.207 --> 01:15:18.781 region:rollup3
frequent and larger --

01:15:13.142 --> 01:15:19.248 region:rollup3
Displays of that --

01:15:14.744 --> 01:15:22.952 region:rollup3
As we are so with that --

01:15:18.781 --> 01:15:24.754 region:rollup3
Where are we with --

01:15:19.248 --> 01:15:26.722 region:rollup3
The new normal --

01:15:22.952 --> 01:15:29.125 region:rollup3
The new normal is the normal --

01:15:24.754 --> 01:15:30.860 region:rollup3
And so we're we are.

01:15:26.722 --> 01:15:34.797 region:rollup3
Changing that vernacular within

01:15:29.125 --> 01:15:36.899 region:rollup3
our our department --

01:15:30.860 --> 01:15:37.500 region:rollup3
Because new normal that was good

01:15:34.797 --> 01:15:39.168 region:rollup3
two years ago --

01:15:36.899 --> 01:15:39.468 region:rollup3
This year in going for work

01:15:37.500 --> 01:15:42.705 region:rollup3
we're at a point where this is

01:15:39.168 --> 01:15:45.041 region:rollup3
the normal.

01:15:39.468 --> 01:15:47.076 region:rollup3
And the state --

01:15:42.705 --> 01:15:49.145 region:rollup3
Has through through much of the

01:15:45.041 --> 01:15:51.147 region:rollup3
effort of of your officials

01:15:47.076 --> 01:15:52.915 region:rollup3
appear on the stage but also on

01:15:49.145 --> 01:15:54.950 region:rollup3
the backs of of you when the

01:15:51.147 --> 01:15:56.919 region:rollup3

Had have made a Andy

01:15:56.919 --> 01:16:02.925 region:rollup3
astronomical investment in the

01:15:58.854 --> 01:16:04.827 region:rollup3
future of of the fire services

01:15:59.455 --> 01:16:05.127 region:rollup3
--

01:16:02.925 --> 01:16:06.962 region:rollup3
In general in California

01:16:04.827 --> 01:16:08.798 region:rollup3
[inaudible]

01:16:05.127 --> 01:16:11.300 region:rollup3
Or is.

01:16:06.962 --> 01:16:12.968 region:rollup3
Working hard to meet the the

01:16:08.798 --> 01:16:14.804 region:rollup3
expectations of the funding that

01:16:11.300 --> 01:16:15.104 region:rollup3
has been.

01:16:12.968 --> 01:16:18.908 region:rollup3
Pushed in our direction --

01:16:14.804 --> 01:16:19.241 region:rollup3

Increasing our the readiness of

01:16:18.908 --> 01:16:25.147 region:rollup3
our fleet --

01:16:19.241 --> 01:16:28.951 region:rollup3
We've increased some numbers of

01:16:22.778 --> 01:16:31.053 region:rollup3
firefighting --

01:16:25.147 --> 01:16:33.422 region:rollup3
Capable resources both human and

01:16:28.951 --> 01:16:36.892 region:rollup3
and equipment --

01:16:31.053 --> 01:16:37.460 region:rollup3
We're increasing our our

01:16:33.422 --> 01:16:40.930 region:rollup3
commitment to our environmental

01:16:36.892 --> 01:16:42.998 region:rollup3
planner types who will be

helping with our in secret

01:16:40.930 --> 01:16:46.936 region:rollup3
clearance --

01:16:42.998 --> 01:16:48.904 region:rollup3
For fuels reduction work and

01:16:43.599 --> 01:16:49.405 region:rollup3
prescribed fire.

01:16:46.936 --> 01:16:52.908 region:rollup3
And let me just give you some of

01:16:48.904 --> 01:16:54.910 region:rollup3
the the the numbers --

01:16:49.405 --> 01:16:55.544 region:rollup3
Seeking --

01:16:52.908 --> 01:16:57.279 region:rollup3
Reference these going forward

01:16:54.910 --> 01:16:58.881 region:rollup3
and you couldn't you can pull

01:16:55.544 --> 01:17:00.883 region:rollup3
these out of the the governor's

01:16:57.279 --> 01:17:02.885 region:rollup3
executive order --

01:16:58.881 --> 01:17:05.187 region:rollup3
For force management --

01:17:00.883 --> 01:17:07.189 region:rollup3
But also --

01:17:02.885 --> 01:17:11.093 region:rollup3
Some of the that numbers of of

01:17:05.187 --> 01:17:13.128 region:rollup3
dollars that have are coming out

01:17:07.189 --> 01:17:14.897 region:rollup3
of of the current budget --

01:17:11.093 --> 01:17:15.231 region:rollup3
Sixteen million dollars will --

01:17:13.128 --> 01:17:19.068 region:rollup3
Worth of a replacement for

01:17:14.897 --> 01:17:20.836 region:rollup3
equipment --

01:17:15.231 --> 01:17:21.437 region:rollup3
Vehicles that we've been sorely

01:17:19.068 --> 01:17:25.040 region:rollup3
needing M. and behind on

01:17:20.836 --> 01:17:27.243 region:rollup3
replacement umps will be up

01:17:21.437 --> 01:17:29.044 region:rollup3
upgrading our our fleet --

01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:31.180 region:rollup3
A ten million dollars in

01:17:27.243 --> 01:17:33.182 region:rollup3
community based fire prevention

01:17:29.044 --> 01:17:35.351 region:rollup3
work that's going to be coming

01:17:31.180 --> 01:17:37.319 region:rollup3
directly down to the ground

01:17:33.182 --> 01:17:39.088 region:rollup3
level and for our communities to

01:17:35.351 --> 01:17:41.023 region:rollup3
draw on through their local --

01:17:37.319 --> 01:17:43.292 region:rollup3
County fire and or cal fire

01:17:39.088 --> 01:17:45.160 region:rollup3
units -- To

01:17:41.023 --> 01:17:45.694 region:rollup3
to work on local based again

01:17:43.292 --> 01:17:48.797 region:rollup3
this is for us to help you help

01:17:45.160 --> 01:17:49.298 region:rollup3
yourselves to become more

01:17:45.694 --> 01:17:50.966 region:rollup3
resilient --

01:17:48.797 --> 01:17:51.600 region:rollup3
In protection of your

01:17:49.298 --> 01:17:52.968 region:rollup3
communities --

01:17:50.966 --> 01:17:59.008 region:rollup3
From wildfire in their disasters

01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:59.308 region:rollup3
--

01:17:52.968 --> 01:18:01.477 region:rollup3
There are going to be --

01:17:59.008 --> 01:18:02.978 region:rollup3
Six fire --

01:17:59.308 --> 01:18:07.016 region:rollup3
Fuels management crews that the

01:18:01.477 --> 01:18:09.018 region:rollup3
state is is --

01:18:02.978 --> 01:18:11.020 region:rollup3
Going to hire and have as a

01:18:07.016 --> 01:18:13.122 region:rollup3
permanent --

01:18:09.018 --> 01:18:13.756 region:rollup3
Piece of our our arsenal and

01:18:11.020 --> 01:18:16.926 region:rollup3
they're knocking me fire going

01:18:13.122 --> 01:18:17.526 region:rollup3
crews they're gonna trained to

01:18:13.756 --> 01:18:18.961 region:rollup3
fire going standards and they

01:18:16.926 --> 01:18:20.996 region:rollup3
will react if there's a fire

01:18:17.526 --> 01:18:21.664 region:rollup3
locally.

01:18:18.961 --> 01:18:23.065 region:rollup3
But their whole mission for

01:18:20.996 --> 01:18:25.234 region:rollup3
those six cruise is going to be

01:18:21.664 --> 01:18:25.834 region:rollup3
fuels work.

01:18:23.065 --> 01:18:27.369 region:rollup3
So that's something that we're

01:18:25.234 --> 01:18:29.138 region:rollup3
gonna be doing throughout the

01:18:25.834 --> 01:18:29.772 region:rollup3
state and where there's a

01:18:27.369 --> 01:18:31.106 region:rollup3
critical need --

01:18:29.138 --> 01:18:33.008 region:rollup3
We will move those crews into

01:18:29.772 --> 01:18:35.077 region:rollup3
those areas and do those

01:18:31.106 --> 01:18:36.979 region:rollup3
projects and then --

01:18:33.008 --> 01:18:37.379 region:rollup3
Respond accordingly and and

01:18:35.077 --> 01:18:41.250 region:rollup3
retract accordingly.

01:18:36.979 --> 01:18:41.917 region:rollup3
We got the fires.

01:18:37.379 --> 01:18:44.987 region:rollup3
There last year's budget had two

01:18:41.250 --> 01:18:47.056 region:rollup3
hundred million dollars worth of

01:18:41.917 --> 01:18:49.391 region:rollup3
of fuels management --

01:18:44.987 --> 01:18:51.493 region:rollup3
Dollars that has right now --

01:18:47.056 --> 01:18:53.162 region:rollup3
Almost all been allocated to

01:18:49.391 --> 01:18:57.099 region:rollup3
large scale projects across

01:18:51.493 --> 01:18:57.733 region:rollup3
California --

01:18:53.162 --> 01:18:59.435 region:rollup3
We a have been --

01:18:57.099 --> 01:19:01.337 region:rollup3
Getting a grant money for fuels

01:18:57.733 --> 01:19:01.637 region:rollup3
project work and the hundreds of

01:18:59.435 --> 01:19:05.174 region:rollup3
thousands to several million

01:19:01.337 --> 01:19:07.309 region:rollup3
dollars --

01:19:01.637 --> 01:19:07.643 region:rollup3
Per year and targeting those --

01:19:05.174 --> 01:19:11.113 region:rollup3
Two places where they would have

01:19:07.309 --> 01:19:13.115 region:rollup3
been needed.

01:19:07.643 --> 01:19:13.716 region:rollup3
These are going in large chunks

01:19:11.113 --> 01:19:15.150 region:rollup3
to large landscape level

01:19:13.115 --> 01:19:16.986 region:rollup3
projects to do watershed level

01:19:13.716 --> 01:19:19.588 region:rollup3
work.

01:19:15.150 --> 01:19:19.922 region:rollup3
And so --

01:19:16.986 --> 01:19:23.058 region:rollup3
Some some of those funds will be

01:19:19.588 --> 01:19:25.194 region:rollup3
coming -- To

01:19:19.922 --> 01:19:27.262 region:rollup3
the local area.

01:19:23.058 --> 01:19:29.064 region:rollup3
We'll be touching every --

01:19:25.194 --> 01:19:31.033 region:rollup3
Every part of California.

01:19:27.262 --> 01:19:33.269 region:rollup3
This year an additional hundred

01:19:29.064 --> 01:19:35.037 region:rollup3
and sixty million dollars to is

01:19:31.033 --> 01:19:35.671 region:rollup3
going into the same program so.

01:19:33.269 --> 01:19:37.106 region:rollup3
Between last year and this year

01:19:35.037 --> 01:19:39.308 region:rollup3
three hundred sixty plus million

01:19:35.671 --> 01:19:39.575 region:rollup3
dollars are going to fuels --

01:19:37.106 --> 01:19:42.978 region:rollup3
Related work --

01:19:39.308 --> 01:19:45.147 region:rollup3
To help --

01:19:39.575 --> 01:19:47.283 region:rollup3
Towards.

01:19:42.978 --> 01:19:51.086 region:rollup3
Mitigating the forced up issues

01:19:45.147 --> 01:19:55.157 region:rollup3
but also the the fuels issues

01:19:47.283 --> 01:19:55.424 region:rollup3
around communities.

01:19:51.086 --> 01:19:57.326 region:rollup3
The other part of the executive

01:19:55.157 --> 01:20:01.163 region:rollup3
order --

01:19:55.424 --> 01:20:03.032 region:rollup3
Point toward increasing the pace

01:19:57.326 --> 01:20:05.000 region:rollup3
and scale of of work on the

01:20:01.163 --> 01:20:07.436 region:rollup3
landscape --

01:20:03.032 --> 01:20:09.538 region:rollup3
To reduce fuels.

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:11.573 region:rollup3
Are we are currently doing an

01:20:07.436 --> 01:20:12.174 region:rollup3
average of approximately two

01:20:09.538 --> 01:20:13.242 region:rollup3
hundred and fifty thousand acres

01:20:11.573 --> 01:20:15.077 region:rollup3
of of project work across the

01:20:12.174 --> 01:20:17.279 region:rollup3
state.

01:20:13.242 --> 01:20:17.880 region:rollup3
We will --

01:20:15.077 --> 01:20:21.183 region:rollup3
Be increasing that to

01:20:17.279 --> 01:20:23.585 region:rollup3
approximately a half million

01:20:17.880 --> 01:20:25.320 region:rollup3
acres -- If

01:20:21.183 --> 01:20:29.024 region:rollup3
you look at that as a whole --

01:20:23.585 --> 01:20:31.226 region:rollup3
It's it's not enough on the on

01:20:25.320 --> 01:20:33.462 region:rollup3
the entire statewide basis but

01:20:29.024 --> 01:20:35.230 region:rollup3
the federal got black. For

01:20:31.226 --> 01:20:37.099 region:rollup3
service and federal agencies are

01:20:33.462 --> 01:20:39.468 region:rollup3
committing to an additional half

01:20:35.230 --> 01:20:41.203 region:rollup3
million acres of one million --

01:20:37.099 --> 01:20:43.172 region:rollup3
Per year that we are looking at

01:20:39.468 --> 01:20:45.708 region:rollup3
moving toward --

01:20:41.203 --> 01:20:47.543 region:rollup3
Over the next several years.

01:20:43.172 --> 01:20:51.313 region:rollup3
The we're gonna be doing more

01:20:45.708 --> 01:20:55.184 region:rollup3
our education and outreach and

01:20:47.543 --> 01:20:57.219 region:rollup3
certifying more individuals and

01:20:51.313 --> 01:20:59.355 region:rollup3
departments in prescribed.

01:20:55.184 --> 01:21:01.223 region:rollup3
We're gonna be looking at the

01:20:57.219 --> 01:21:03.025 region:rollup3
liability issue of that and

01:20:59.355 --> 01:21:05.394 region:rollup3
fearing out ways that we can

01:21:01.223 --> 01:21:07.296 region:rollup3
work toward shared liability --

01:21:03.025 --> 01:21:09.331 region:rollup3
In some fashion under a

01:21:05.394 --> 01:21:11.333 region:rollup3
controlled setting.

01:21:07.296 --> 01:21:15.204 region:rollup3
And streamlining the permitting

01:21:09.331 --> 01:21:15.738 region:rollup3
process to get from.

01:21:11.333 --> 01:21:19.308 region:rollup3
A planned burn or project.

01:21:15.204 --> 01:21:21.377 region:rollup3
To the work being done on

01:21:15.738 --> 01:21:23.178 region:rollup3
around.

01:21:19.308 --> 01:21:25.180 region:rollup3
There the governor --

01:21:21.377 --> 01:21:25.814 region:rollup3
Enacted a tree mortality taps

01:21:23.178 --> 01:21:27.216 region:rollup3
force I'm sorry tree mortality

01:21:25.180 --> 01:21:29.485 region:rollup3
task force that was last year

01:21:25.814 --> 01:21:31.387 region:rollup3
last three years.

01:21:27.216 --> 01:21:33.355 region:rollup3
That has morphed into the forest

01:21:29.485 --> 01:21:35.357 region:rollup3
management task force force

01:21:31.387 --> 01:21:37.159 region:rollup3
management task force is going

01:21:33.355 --> 01:21:39.228 region:rollup3
to be working with all --

01:21:35.357 --> 01:21:41.363 region:rollup3
All of the state agencies and

01:21:37.159 --> 01:21:43.265 region:rollup3
our federal counterparts. To do

01:21:39.228 --> 01:21:45.367 region:rollup3
all of these things that I

01:21:41.363 --> 01:21:49.138 region:rollup3
mentioned previously.

01:21:43.265 --> 01:21:51.140 region:rollup3
But to to collaborative Lee --

01:21:45.367 --> 01:21:53.208 region:rollup3
Come to a point where world

01:21:49.138 --> 01:21:55.244 region:rollup3
we're speaking with one voice --

01:21:51.140 --> 01:21:57.079 region:rollup3
In moving toward --

01:21:53.208 --> 01:21:59.648 region:rollup3
More resilient Morrell zillion

01:21:55.244 --> 01:22:01.083 region:rollup3
forests and more resilient.

01:21:57.079 --> 01:22:03.485 region:rollup3
And Evert me say Forrest several

01:21:59.648 --> 01:22:05.421 region:rollup3
times.

01:22:01.083 --> 01:22:06.054 region:rollup3
Forest is what we have behind

01:22:03.485 --> 01:22:07.523 region:rollup3
you -- If

01:22:05.421 --> 01:22:09.191 region:rollup3
you think of forest like the

01:22:06.054 --> 01:22:09.858 region:rollup3
Forest Service because their

01:22:07.523 --> 01:22:11.627 region:rollup3
poorest.

01:22:09.191 --> 01:22:15.164 region:rollup3
And we have a lot of acres of

01:22:09.858 --> 01:22:17.566 region:rollup3
forest that are in southern

The fair claim settlement

01:25:31.326 --> 01:25:35.564 region:rollup3
practice rags and additional

consumer protections that

supersedes standard policy

01:25:35.564 --> 01:25:39.868 region:rollup3

01:25:37.599 --> 01:25:42.037 region:rollup3
Such as was the case with these

01:25:39.868 --> 01:25:43.872 region:rollup3

Pray on disaster victims after

01:26:05.594 --> 01:26:09.698 region:rollup3
the disaster occurs.

01:26:07.529 --> 01:26:11.366 region:rollup3
Commissioner Jones issued a

01:26:08.096 --> 01:26:12.000 region:rollup3
notice to insurance carriers

01:26:09.698 --> 01:26:13.769 region:rollup3
asking them to waive the

01:26:11.366 --> 01:26:15.904 region:rollup3
requirement of a detailed home

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:17.539 region:rollup3
inventory. For policy holders

01:26:13.769 --> 01:26:19.374 region:rollup3

So that fired --

Survivors who experienced a

01:26:19.941 --> 01:26:25.781 region:rollup3
total loss could be spared the

01:26:22.077 --> 01:26:27.549 region:rollup3
painful task of trying to

01:26:23.745 --> 01:26:28.150 region:rollup3
remember in list every item they

01:26:25.781 --> 01:26:29.651 region:rollup3

01:26:27.549 --> 01:26:31.353 region:rollup3
The insurers that agreed to

01:26:29.651 --> 01:26:34.056 region:rollup3
more than 98%.

The the total loss clings fired

01:26:33.422 --> 01:26:39.695 region:rollup3
filed as a result of the two

01:26:34.056 --> 01:26:41.596 region:rollup3
thousand seventeen wildfires.

01:26:37.459 --> 01:26:41.863 region:rollup3
Regarding the January mudslides

01:26:39.695 --> 01:26:43.598 region:rollup3
commissioner Jones toured the

01:26:41.596 --> 01:26:45.634 region:rollup3
impact --

01:26:41.863 --> 01:26:46.268 region:rollup3
Locations we deployed our

01:26:43.598 --> 01:26:47.936 region:rollup3
disaster response teams to the

01:26:45.634 --> 01:26:49.871 region:rollup3
areas to assist people at the

01:26:46.268 --> 01:26:51.840 region:rollup3
local acceptance centers we also

01:26:47.936 --> 01:26:53.575 region:rollup3
held town hall meetings and

01:26:49.871 --> 01:26:55.677 region:rollup3
workshops to assist as many

01:26:51.840 --> 01:26:57.345 region:rollup3
survivors as possible.

01:26:53.575 --> 01:26:57.879 region:rollup3
In January of this year.

01:26:55.677 --> 01:26:59.548 region:rollup3
After hearing that some

01:26:57.345 --> 01:27:01.717 region:rollup3
insurance companies were

01:26:57.879 --> 01:27:03.618 region:rollup3
advising their insurance that

01:26:59.548 --> 01:27:04.152 region:rollup3
mud slide damage was not covered

01:27:01.717 --> 01:27:06.088 region:rollup3
under the homeowner policy.

01:27:03.618 --> 01:27:07.789 region:rollup3
Commissioner Jones issued

01:27:04.152 --> 01:27:09.758 region:rollup3
unnoticed all property insurers

01:27:06.088 --> 01:27:10.325 region:rollup3
this notice reminded insurers of

01:27:07.789 --> 01:27:11.593 region:rollup3
the efficient proximate cause

01:27:09.758 --> 01:27:13.895 region:rollup3
doctrine which is California

01:27:10.325 --> 01:27:15.664 region:rollup3
law.

01:27:11.593 --> 01:27:16.131 region:rollup3
Their duty was to cover damages

01:27:13.895 --> 01:27:17.532 region:rollup3
from the recent mudslides and

01:27:15.664 --> 01:27:19.568 region:rollup3
debris flows if it was

01:27:16.131 --> 01:27:20.135 region:rollup3
determined.

01:27:17.532 --> 01:27:21.536 region:rollup3
The Tom aspire was the efficient

01:27:19.568 --> 01:27:23.772 region:rollup3
proximate cause of the mud

01:27:20.135 --> 01:27:25.774 region:rollup3
slides.

01:27:21.536 --> 01:27:26.408 region:rollup3
The preliminary and subsequent

01:27:23.772 --> 01:27:27.642 region:rollup3
information showed that the

01:27:25.774 --> 01:27:29.411 region:rollup3
Thomas fire which was a covered

01:27:26.408 --> 01:27:31.413 region:rollup3
peril.

01:27:27.642 --> 01:27:33.548 region:rollup3
What the official proximate

01:27:29.411 --> 01:27:35.517 region:rollup3
cause of the subsequent mud flow

01:27:31.413 --> 01:27:36.151 region:rollup3
mudslides and debris flows?

01:27:33.548 --> 01:27:37.819 region:rollup3
Therefore we do expect insurers

01:27:35.517 --> 01:27:39.654 region:rollup3
to cover these claims under the

01:27:36.151 --> 01:27:40.255 region:rollup3
property owners homeowner's

01:27:37.819 --> 01:27:41.523 region:rollup3
insurance policy.

01:27:39.654 --> 01:27:41.823 region:rollup3
As well as under commercial

01:27:40.255 --> 01:27:43.558 region:rollup3
policies in most cases

01:27:41.523 --> 01:27:45.961 region:rollup3
[inaudible]

01:27:41.823 --> 01:27:46.628 region:rollup3
We understand.

01:27:43.558 --> 01:27:47.796 region:rollup3
The for those whose homes are

01:27:45.961 --> 01:27:49.898 region:rollup3
covered under the national flood

01:27:46.628 --> 01:27:50.532 region:rollup3
insurance program their claims

01:27:47.796 --> 01:27:53.468 region:rollup3
may be completely or partially

01:27:49.898 --> 01:27:54.136 region:rollup3
covered under those policies as

01:27:50.532 --> 01:27:55.904 region:rollup3
well.

01:27:53.468 --> 01:27:57.606 region:rollup3
The department held several one

01:27:54.136 --> 01:27:58.206 region:rollup3
on one workshops allowed

01:27:55.904 --> 01:27:59.474 region:rollup3
survivors the opportunity to

01:27:57.606 --> 01:28:01.643 region:rollup3
speak with department claims

01:27:58.206 --> 01:28:03.578 region:rollup3
experts in a private session.

01:27:59.474 --> 01:28:05.580 region:rollup3
On the central coast those

01:28:01.643 --> 01:28:06.081 region:rollup3
workshops were held in February

01:28:03.578 --> 01:28:07.616 region:rollup3
both inventor and Senate Barbara

01:28:05.580 --> 01:28:09.751 region:rollup3
and again in April in.

01:28:06.081 --> 01:28:10.218 region:rollup3
Santa Barbara.

01:28:07.616 --> 01:28:11.720 region:rollup3
We met with hundreds of

01:28:09.751 --> 01:28:13.688 region:rollup3
survivors during those

01:28:10.218 --> 01:28:14.322 region:rollup3
workshops.

01:28:11.720 --> 01:28:15.891 region:rollup3
In all commissioner just ones

01:28:13.688 --> 01:28:16.458 region:rollup3
are and my staff met with more

01:28:14.322 --> 01:28:19.628 region:rollup3
than five thousand survivor

01:28:15.891 --> 01:28:20.162 region:rollup3
statewide in these various

01:28:16.458 --> 01:28:21.930 region:rollup3
venues.

01:28:19.628 --> 01:28:22.464 region:rollup3
After meeting with fires

01:28:20.162 --> 01:28:23.732 region:rollup3
survivors across the state and

01:28:21.930 --> 01:28:25.834 region:rollup3
having heard first and the

01:28:22.464 --> 01:28:27.569 region:rollup3
challenges they were facing.

01:28:23.732 --> 01:28:28.203 region:rollup3
Commissioner Jones directed the

01:28:25.834 --> 01:28:29.971 region:rollup3
department of insurance to

01:28:27.569 --> 01:28:31.640 region:rollup3
develop a package of proposed

01:28:28.203 --> 01:28:33.775 region:rollup3
statutory changes to strengthen

01:28:29.971 --> 01:28:35.443 region:rollup3
the law in this area.

01:28:31.640 --> 01:28:36.044 region:rollup3
The department sponsored and

01:28:33.775 --> 01:28:37.846 region:rollup3
drafted several bills.

01:28:35.443 --> 01:28:38.480 region:rollup3
That would assist current and

01:28:36.044 --> 01:28:39.548 region:rollup3
future survivors of wildfires

01:28:37.846 --> 01:28:41.783 region:rollup3
and other disasters with their

01:28:38.480 --> 01:28:43.685 region:rollup3
recovery.

01:28:39.548 --> 01:28:44.386 region:rollup3
Several of several of these

01:28:41.783 --> 01:28:47.756 region:rollup3
bills are still active and it is

01:28:43.685 --> 01:28:49.691 region:rollup3
our hope they will be enacted in

01:28:44.386 --> 01:28:51.860 region:rollup3
its strong the form as possible.

01:28:47.756 --> 01:28:53.695 region:rollup3
Some statistics today the

01:28:49.691 --> 01:28:54.229 region:rollup3
department received four hundred

01:28:51.860 --> 01:28:56.164 region:rollup3
sixty two consumer requests for

01:28:53.695 --> 01:28:57.666 region:rollup3
assistance or complaints.

01:28:54.229 --> 01:28:58.266 region:rollup3
Relating to the October December

01:28:56.164 --> 01:28:59.834 region:rollup3
wildfires.

01:28:57.666 --> 01:29:01.770 region:rollup3
Many of these cases are under

01:28:58.266 --> 01:29:03.638 region:rollup3
investigation still but so far

01:28:59.834 --> 01:29:04.172 region:rollup3
through our intervention we have

01:29:01.770 --> 01:29:07.742 region:rollup3
been able to recover more than

01:29:03.638 --> 01:29:08.410 region:rollup3
forty million dollars for

01:29:04.172 --> 01:29:08.944 region:rollup3
survivors. For the Tom aspire

01:29:07.742 --> 01:29:11.846 region:rollup3
the department received eighty

01:29:08.410 --> 01:29:12.447 region:rollup3
four consumer requests for

01:29:08.944 --> 01:29:14.015 region:rollup3
assistance and so far we've been

01:29:11.846 --> 01:29:16.117 region:rollup3
able to recover four million

01:29:12.447 --> 01:29:17.819 region:rollup3
dollars the Thomas wildfire

01:29:14.015 --> 01:29:18.453 region:rollup3
survivors. For the money Seto

01:29:16.117 --> 01:29:19.688 region:rollup3
went mudslides the department

01:29:17.819 --> 01:29:21.890 region:rollup3
has not received a large number

01:29:18.453 --> 01:29:23.792 region:rollup3
of complaints.

01:29:19.688 --> 01:29:25.794 region:rollup3
Especially after commissioner

01:29:21.890 --> 01:29:27.896 region:rollup3
Jones issued his January notice.

01:29:23.792 --> 01:29:28.363 region:rollup3
Advising Richard the efficient

01:29:25.794 --> 01:29:29.497 region:rollup3
proximate cause doctrine we

01:29:27.896 --> 01:29:31.800 region:rollup3
received about twenty

01:29:28.363 --> 01:29:32.267 region:rollup3
complaints.

01:29:29.497 --> 01:29:34.102 region:rollup3
I would like to say that if any

01:29:31.800 --> 01:29:35.804 region:rollup3
member of the public.

01:29:32.267 --> 01:29:36.404 region:rollup3
Has suffered a loss from the mud

01:29:34.102 --> 01:29:38.273 region:rollup3
slides please file your claim

01:29:35.804 --> 01:29:40.041 region:rollup3
with your insurance company.

01:29:36.404 --> 01:29:40.642 region:rollup3
If that claim is denied or even

01:29:38.273 --> 01:29:43.745 region:rollup3
delayed please contact the

01:29:40.041 --> 01:29:44.379 region:rollup3
department and filed a request

01:29:40.642 --> 01:29:46.181 region:rollup3
for assistance.

01:29:43.745 --> 01:29:47.949 region:rollup3
Now last week the department

01:29:44.379 --> 01:29:49.651 region:rollup3
receipt to specific questions

01:29:46.181 --> 01:29:50.252 region:rollup3
from committee staff I would

01:29:47.949 --> 01:29:51.887 region:rollup3
like to address those questions.

01:29:49.651 --> 01:29:53.521 region:rollup3
The first question involves

01:29:50.252 --> 01:29:55.991 region:rollup3
insureds to do not feel that

01:29:51.887 --> 01:29:56.458 region:rollup3
their insurers providing

01:29:53.521 --> 01:29:58.260 region:rollup3
adequate compensation for their

01:29:55.991 --> 01:29:59.861 region:rollup3
claim we were asked.

01:29:56.458 --> 01:30:01.663 region:rollup3
What would your office suggest

01:29:58.260 --> 01:30:02.330 region:rollup3
they do next to rebut the

01:29:59.861 --> 01:30:04.065 region:rollup3
insurance companies offer?

01:30:01.663 --> 01:30:05.934 region:rollup3
Are there resources that either

01:30:02.330 --> 01:30:07.769 region:rollup3
your office or another entity

01:30:04.065 --> 01:30:09.904 region:rollup3
can offer to guide individuals

01:30:05.934 --> 01:30:10.572 region:rollup3
through this process.

01:30:07.769 --> 01:30:12.040 region:rollup3
In the case were insured is at

01:30:09.904 --> 01:30:13.675 region:rollup3
an impasse with their insurer in

01:30:10.572 --> 01:30:15.910 region:rollup3
feels they're not they're not

01:30:12.040 --> 01:30:16.411 region:rollup3
being fairly compensated.

01:30:13.675 --> 01:30:18.079 region:rollup3
We would ask that you

01:30:15.910 --> 01:30:19.981 region:rollup3
immediately contact the

01:30:16.411 --> 01:30:20.548 region:rollup3
department's we sign the case to

01:30:18.079 --> 01:30:21.683 region:rollup3
an insurance compliance officer

01:30:19.981 --> 01:30:23.818 region:rollup3
who can seek to resolve the

01:30:20.548 --> 01:30:24.452 region:rollup3
dispute.

01:30:21.683 --> 01:30:26.021 region:rollup3
Our department staff have the

01:30:23.818 --> 01:30:27.789 region:rollup3
expertise to resolve many of

01:30:24.452 --> 01:30:29.758 region:rollup3
these disputes and if there's

01:30:26.021 --> 01:30:30.425 region:rollup3
issue that we cannot.

01:30:27.789 --> 01:30:31.793 region:rollup3
Have that cannot be resolved

01:30:29.758 --> 01:30:33.862 region:rollup3
through our wrecked intervention

01:30:30.425 --> 01:30:34.129 region:rollup3
the department administers a

01:30:31.793 --> 01:30:35.997 region:rollup3
statutory disaster mediation

01:30:33.862 --> 01:30:37.932 region:rollup3
program.

01:30:34.129 --> 01:30:39.768 region:rollup3
Under that program survivor may

01:30:35.997 --> 01:30:41.836 region:rollup3
wish to enter into mediation

01:30:37.932 --> 01:30:42.370 region:rollup3
where we assign an outside

01:30:39.768 --> 01:30:44.039 region:rollup3
mediator to seek resolution of

01:30:41.836 --> 01:30:45.607 region:rollup3
the claim dispute issue.

01:30:42.370 --> 01:30:47.709 region:rollup3
This mediation program is free

01:30:44.039 --> 01:30:48.310 region:rollup3
for a consumer.

01:30:45.607 --> 01:30:49.978 region:rollup3
It is non binding.

01:30:47.709 --> 01:30:50.612 region:rollup3
So if the consumers not happy

01:30:48.310 --> 01:30:53.848 region:rollup3
with the suggested supplement

01:30:49.978 --> 01:30:54.382 region:rollup3
the consumer may walk away and

01:30:50.612 --> 01:30:55.917 region:rollup3
pursue other remedies.

01:30:53.848 --> 01:30:57.619 region:rollup3
At the conclusion of this

01:30:54.382 --> 01:30:58.253 region:rollup3
hearing a member of my team will

01:30:55.917 --> 01:31:01.856 region:rollup3
be in the back of the auditorium

01:30:57.619 --> 01:31:02.424 region:rollup3
with brochures that describe the

01:30:58.253 --> 01:31:02.657 region:rollup3
mediation program.

01:31:01.856 --> 01:31:04.025 region:rollup3
The second question we were

01:31:02.424 --> 01:31:06.027 region:rollup3
asked.

01:31:02.657 --> 01:31:07.762 region:rollup3
In isn't imply that some

01:31:04.025 --> 01:31:09.798 region:rollup3
insurers are the lane mud slide

01:31:06.027 --> 01:31:11.766 region:rollup3
damage claims.

01:31:07.762 --> 01:31:13.935 region:rollup3
In order to wait for a report or

01:31:09.798 --> 01:31:16.171 region:rollup3
updated FEMA maps.

01:31:11.766 --> 01:31:17.706 region:rollup3
The question also suggested that

01:31:13.935 --> 01:31:17.972 region:rollup3
updated FEMA maps may be used an

01:31:16.171 --> 01:31:21.676 region:rollup3
impact future insurance rates in

01:31:17.706 --> 01:31:23.812 region:rollup3
premium.

01:31:17.972 --> 01:31:24.479 region:rollup3
In the area of the months like.

01:31:21.676 --> 01:31:26.214 region:rollup3
The department is not aware of

01:31:23.812 --> 01:31:28.083 region:rollup3
any insurer that is waiting on a

01:31:24.479 --> 01:31:28.650 region:rollup3
theme of report or updated map

01:31:26.214 --> 01:31:30.285 region:rollup3
to invent or in order to

01:31:28.083 --> 01:31:31.786 region:rollup3
investigate evaluate were

01:31:28.650 --> 01:31:34.022 region:rollup3
settled either wildfire or much

01:31:30.285 --> 01:31:35.757 region:rollup3
like claim.

01:31:31.786 --> 01:31:36.391 region:rollup3
We have received no complaints

01:31:34.022 --> 01:31:37.892 region:rollup3
that any insurers Dillane

01:31:35.757 --> 01:31:39.761 region:rollup3
settlement of claims waiting for

01:31:36.391 --> 01:31:42.030 region:rollup3
report or updated map.

01:31:37.892 --> 01:31:43.765 region:rollup3
If their is a constituent that

01:31:39.761 --> 01:31:44.399 region:rollup3
is experiencing to delay by

01:31:42.030 --> 01:31:45.800 region:rollup3
their insurer on the this basis

01:31:43.765 --> 01:31:47.902 region:rollup3
they should immediately contact

01:31:44.399 --> 01:31:48.536 region:rollup3
us.

01:31:45.800 --> 01:31:49.904 region:rollup3
The question also refers of the

01:31:47.902 --> 01:31:51.740 region:rollup3
possible readjustment insurance

01:31:48.536 --> 01:31:52.407 region:rollup3
rates.

01:31:49.904 --> 01:31:53.975 region:rollup3
Insurance rates are regulated by

01:31:51.740 --> 01:31:55.944 region:rollup3
the department under very strict

01:31:52.407 --> 01:31:57.679 region:rollup3
standards uninsured may not

01:31:53.975 --> 01:32:00.015 region:rollup3
automatically raise rates and

01:31:55.944 --> 01:32:00.682 region:rollup3
therefore individual insurance

01:31:57.679 --> 01:32:02.283 region:rollup3
the insurance premiums.

01:32:00.015 --> 01:32:03.918 region:rollup3
Without first meeting a new rate

01:32:00.682 --> 01:32:06.054 region:rollup3
filing with the department's

01:32:02.283 --> 01:32:07.756 region:rollup3
rate regulation branch.

01:32:03.918 --> 01:32:08.456 region:rollup3
That filing must then be

01:32:06.054 --> 01:32:10.058 region:rollup3
approved by the department.

01:32:07.756 --> 01:32:11.960 region:rollup3
Therefore we do not expect there

01:32:08.456 --> 01:32:12.527 region:rollup3
to be any immediate rate premium

01:32:10.058 --> 01:32:13.895 region:rollup3
impact as a result of new

01:32:11.960 --> 01:32:16.197 region:rollup3
reports or mapping of the

01:32:12.527 --> 01:32:17.899 region:rollup3
modesty to area.

01:32:13.895 --> 01:32:19.868 region:rollup3
However the department will

01:32:16.197 --> 01:32:22.070 region:rollup3
obtain a review any reports or

01:32:17.899 --> 01:32:24.105 region:rollup3
maps that are prepared.

01:32:19.868 --> 01:32:24.606 region:rollup3
Lastly for a type of insurance

01:32:22.070 --> 01:32:25.974 region:rollup3
issue or dispute if any member

01:32:24.105 --> 01:32:26.541 region:rollup3
of the public is having

01:32:24.606 --> 01:32:30.011 region:rollup3
difficulty with.

01:32:25.974 --> 01:32:31.780 region:rollup3
Or just not sure about the

01:32:26.541 --> 01:32:32.347 region:rollup3
advice being given by nature an

01:32:30.011 --> 01:32:37.952 region:rollup3
adjuster an agent or broker.

01:32:31.780 --> 01:32:39.788 region:rollup3
Please contact our consumer

01:32:32.347 --> 01:32:41.756 region:rollup3
services team toll free at

01:32:37.952 --> 01:32:45.894 region:rollup3

insurance dot CA dot gov.

01:32:45.894 --> 01:32:49.764 region:rollup3
Now we can't resolve all the

01:32:46.494 --> 01:32:50.265 region:rollup3
issues of disputes that are

01:32:48.196 --> 01:32:51.800 region:rollup3
brought to our attention but we

01:32:49.764 --> 01:32:54.069 region:rollup3
certainly cannot help.

01:32:50.265 --> 01:32:56.037 region:rollup3
If we're not contacted.

01:32:51.800 --> 01:32:56.704 region:rollup3
This concludes my testimony for

01:32:54.069 --> 01:32:58.406 region:rollup3
any of those would like the

01:32:56.037 --> 01:32:59.841 region:rollup3
department to review their case.

01:32:56.704 --> 01:33:01.943 region:rollup3
An officer of my team is in the

01:32:58.406 --> 01:33:02.343 region:rollup3
back of the room afterwards to

01:32:59.841 --> 01:33:05.914 region:rollup3

keeping your questions together.

01:33:25.934 --> 01:33:31.906 region:rollup3
Us Sacramento has been

01:33:27.902 --> 01:33:33.808 region:rollup3
particularly busy --

01:33:28.369 --> 01:33:34.409 region:rollup3
In response to the natural fires

01:33:31.906 --> 01:33:36.344 region:rollup3
up the senator and I have not

01:33:33.808 --> 01:33:38.046 region:rollup3
only met with our colleagues

01:33:34.409 --> 01:33:38.513 region:rollup3
that represent some of the most

01:33:36.344 --> 01:33:40.215 region:rollup3
impacted and I. areas in

01:33:38.046 --> 01:33:42.283 region:rollup3
northern California.

01:33:38.513 --> 01:33:44.018 region:rollup3
I'm on a periodic basis to

01:33:40.215 --> 01:33:46.020 region:rollup3
discuss I'm a collective effort

01:33:42.283 --> 01:33:46.588 region:rollup3
in terms of moving forward but

01:33:44.018 --> 01:33:49.991 region:rollup3
there have been many members on

01:33:46.020 --> 01:33:51.960 region:rollup3
in the legislature who have

01:33:46.588 --> 01:33:52.560 region:rollup3
proposed a series of bills.

01:33:49.991 --> 01:33:54.395 region:rollup3
That we have a list --

01:33:51.960 --> 01:33:56.197 region:rollup3
And for those of you who may

01:33:52.560 --> 01:33:57.999 region:rollup3

01:33:54.395 --> 01:34:00.168 region:rollup3
the back of the room are and in

01:33:56.197 --> 01:34:04.005 region:rollup3
the front of the the hall.

01:33:57.999 --> 01:34:04.506 region:rollup3
I'm with over forty bills that

01:34:00.168 --> 01:34:06.441 region:rollup3
were introduced in.

01:34:04.005 --> 01:34:08.209 region:rollup3
This legislative year.

01:34:04.506 --> 01:34:10.011 region:rollup3
That relate to natural disaster

01:34:06.441 --> 01:34:12.647 region:rollup3
response and recovery I think

01:34:08.209 --> 01:34:14.349 region:rollup3
that some of our panelists M. in

01:34:10.011 --> 01:34:14.682 region:rollup3
this last panel have alluded to

01:34:12.647 --> 01:34:18.119 region:rollup3
bills are still alive some of

01:34:14.349 --> 01:34:18.753 region:rollup3
those bills.

01:34:14.682 --> 01:34:20.155 region:rollup3
I'm are no longer in place.

01:34:18.119 --> 01:34:22.357 region:rollup3
And a few of those bills have

01:34:18.753 --> 01:34:24.325 region:rollup3
been introduced by the both of

01:34:20.155 --> 01:34:25.994 region:rollup3
us and we have been working

01:34:22.357 --> 01:34:28.062 region:rollup3
together on on the bills that

01:34:24.325 --> 01:34:30.431 region:rollup3
we're moving forward one of the

01:34:25.994 --> 01:34:31.1000 region:rollup3
bills that M. that.

01:34:28.062 --> 01:34:34.369 region:rollup3
I co that I authored it have the

01:34:30.431 --> 01:34:36.404 region:rollup3
senator is a co author is.

01:34:31.1000 --> 01:34:38.506 region:rollup3
An office of emergency service

01:34:34.369 --> 01:34:39.974 region:rollup3
translation bill we know and we

01:34:36.404 --> 01:34:40.542 region:rollup3
heard loud and clear as did

01:34:38.506 --> 01:34:45.847 region:rollup3
northern California --

01:34:39.974 --> 01:34:47.982 region:rollup3
How important it was to get

01:34:40.542 --> 01:34:48.516 region:rollup3
timely and for the state in a

01:34:45.847 --> 01:34:50.418 region:rollup3
state that represents over 44%

01:34:47.982 --> 01:34:52.053 region:rollup3
of individuals who speak a

01:34:48.516 --> 01:34:52.720 region:rollup3
language other than English in

01:34:50.418 --> 01:34:54.355 region:rollup3
their home?

01:34:52.053 --> 01:34:56.224 region:rollup3
On and that is something that we

01:34:52.720 --> 01:34:58.293 region:rollup3
are working on unfortunately

01:34:54.355 --> 01:35:00.261 region:rollup3
bill that we that we did start

01:34:56.224 --> 01:35:02.330 region:rollup3
to work on the but that did not

01:34:58.293 --> 01:35:04.299 region:rollup3
make it M. all the way was the

01:35:00.261 --> 01:35:07.936 region:rollup3
consolidated removal program.

01:35:02.330 --> 01:35:10.038 region:rollup3
What you have all experienced in

01:35:04.299 --> 01:35:11.973 region:rollup3
terms of the services with a

01:35:07.936 --> 01:35:12.473 region:rollup3
consolidated debris removal is

01:35:10.038 --> 01:35:14.442 region:rollup3
something that is not law it

01:35:11.973 --> 01:35:16.044 region:rollup3
eight tends to happen?

01:35:12.473 --> 01:35:18.346 region:rollup3
On because we work on it to make

01:35:14.442 --> 01:35:20.248 region:rollup3
it happen M. but that is not a

01:35:16.044 --> 01:35:22.217 region:rollup3
law and we are working and I

01:35:18.346 --> 01:35:24.152 region:rollup3
will look likely revisit it in

01:35:20.248 --> 01:35:26.221 region:rollup3
the coming years and that that

01:35:22.217 --> 01:35:26.888 region:rollup3
is a bill that died --

01:35:24.152 --> 01:35:28.323 region:rollup3
Bills die in a number of six to

01:35:26.221 --> 01:35:30.225 region:rollup3
eight different process and they

01:35:26.888 --> 01:35:32.026 region:rollup3
can die in different ways and it

01:35:28.323 --> 01:35:34.395 region:rollup3
so that was one of them.

01:35:30.225 --> 01:35:36.097 region:rollup3
Out we did have actually.

01:35:32.026 --> 01:35:37.899 region:rollup3
Add that to the cal fire chief

01:35:34.395 --> 01:35:40.401 region:rollup3
mentioned one of the bills and

01:35:36.097 --> 01:35:40.935 region:rollup3
that we authored which is the

01:35:37.899 --> 01:35:42.337 region:rollup3
fire prevention activities local

01:35:40.401 --> 01:35:44.305 region:rollup3
assistant grant program.

01:35:40.935 --> 01:35:46.441 region:rollup3
And as a over ten million

01:35:42.337 --> 01:35:46.874 region:rollup3
dollars to create.

01:35:44.305 --> 01:35:48.409 region:rollup3
A new fire prevention working

01:35:46.441 --> 01:35:50.011 region:rollup3
group composed of

01:35:46.874 --> 01:35:52.247 region:rollup3
representatives and stakeholders

01:35:48.409 --> 01:35:54.015 region:rollup3
from state agencies local

01:35:50.011 --> 01:35:56.050 region:rollup3
governments I. academia

01:35:52.247 --> 01:35:58.219 region:rollup3
interests industry and

01:35:54.015 --> 01:35:58.786 region:rollup3
nonprofits that have experience.

01:35:56.050 --> 01:36:00.355 region:rollup3
An arm vault in state fire

01:35:58.219 --> 01:36:02.290 region:rollup3
prevention at the schools a

01:35:58.786 --> 01:36:04.025 region:rollup3
working group up with the grant

01:36:00.355 --> 01:36:06.261 region:rollup3
program at to identify what

01:36:02.290 --> 01:36:08.229 region:rollup3
those methods are.

01:36:04.025 --> 01:36:08.496 region:rollup3
At those are some of them I know

01:36:06.261 --> 01:36:10.465 region:rollup3
that we additionally have some

01:36:08.229 --> 01:36:12.600 region:rollup3
budget --

01:36:08.496 --> 01:36:16.638 region:rollup3
Work that we've we've.

01:36:10.465 --> 01:36:18.239 region:rollup3
Been able to successfully get to

01:36:12.600 --> 01:36:20.174 region:rollup3
work group and the state I'm

01:36:16.638 --> 01:36:22.043 region:rollup3
representatives on that some of

01:36:18.239 --> 01:36:24.212 region:rollup3
those -- Fun

01:36:20.174 --> 01:36:25.847 region:rollup3
to include --

01:36:22.043 --> 01:36:28.049 region:rollup3
Backfill for property taxes for

01:36:24.212 --> 01:36:30.251 region:rollup3
both Ventura and Santa Barbara

01:36:25.847 --> 01:36:30.685 region:rollup3
county add backs bill for

01:36:28.049 --> 01:36:32.520 region:rollup3
attendance related loss and

01:36:30.251 --> 01:36:34.555 region:rollup3
school districts --

01:36:30.685 --> 01:36:38.359 region:rollup3
And that's specific to K. twelve

01:36:32.520 --> 01:36:40.028 region:rollup3
and community college at school

01:36:34.555 --> 01:36:42.263 region:rollup3
districts we do have a as well

01:36:38.359 --> 01:36:44.365 region:rollup3
as and some.

01:36:40.028 --> 01:36:46.200 region:rollup3
Some match money for a the

01:36:42.263 --> 01:36:48.236 region:rollup3
Associated add debris removal

01:36:44.365 --> 01:36:48.870 region:rollup3

Barbara county as well.

01:36:48.236 --> 01:36:52.674 region:rollup3
And so those are some of the

01:36:48.870 --> 01:36:54.575 region:rollup3
efforts I think add that we've

01:36:50.505 --> 01:36:56.344 region:rollup3
engaged in everything we've done

01:36:52.674 --> 01:36:58.246 region:rollup3
as a center has said we've done

01:36:54.575 --> 01:36:58.846 region:rollup3
together not just on because we

01:36:56.344 --> 01:37:00.181 region:rollup3
represent the disk.

01:36:58.246 --> 01:37:00.815 region:rollup3
But we've also done it with

01:36:58.846 --> 01:37:02.116 region:rollup3
colleagues on in northern

01:37:00.181 --> 01:37:06.254 region:rollup3
California and colleagues in the

01:37:00.815 --> 01:37:10.224 region:rollup3
state legislature [inaudible]

01:37:02.116 --> 01:37:12.393 region:rollup3
As well.

01:37:06.254 --> 01:37:12.994 region:rollup3
I and I I would say that it's

01:37:10.224 --> 01:37:14.028 region:rollup3
this whole circumstance with the

01:37:12.393 --> 01:37:18.132 region:rollup3
Thomas farmer summer prescient

01:37:12.994 --> 01:37:18.599 region:rollup3
--

01:37:14.028 --> 01:37:19.934 region:rollup3
Yeah I have I chair the joint

01:37:18.132 --> 01:37:20.568 region:rollup3
committee on emergency

01:37:18.599 --> 01:37:22.303 region:rollup3
management --

01:37:19.934 --> 01:37:24.238 region:rollup3
And have been very actively

01:37:20.568 --> 01:37:26.040 region:rollup3
involved in this issue since I

01:37:22.303 --> 01:37:26.507 region:rollup3
was elected to the Senate I

01:37:24.238 --> 01:37:28.409 region:rollup3
chaired it for the first session

01:37:26.040 --> 01:37:30.511 region:rollup3
which is two years.

01:37:26.507 --> 01:37:30.878 region:rollup3
As a vice chair last year and

01:37:28.409 --> 01:37:34.182 region:rollup3
the chair this year and it so

01:37:30.511 --> 01:37:36.451 region:rollup3
happened that.

01:37:30.878 --> 01:37:37.018 region:rollup3
On December fourth.

01:37:34.182 --> 01:37:40.154 region:rollup3
I was chairing a committee

01:37:36.451 --> 01:37:40.722 region:rollup3
meeting on the early alert

01:37:37.018 --> 01:37:44.292 region:rollup3
systems --

01:37:40.154 --> 01:37:46.294 region:rollup3
Having gone out to northern

01:37:40.722 --> 01:37:48.096 region:rollup3
California and had my first

01:37:44.292 --> 01:37:48.730 region:rollup3
helicopter experience one of

01:37:46.294 --> 01:37:50.198 region:rollup3
those really clunky old National

01:37:48.096 --> 01:37:52.433 region:rollup3
Guard helicopters it ended up

01:37:48.730 --> 01:37:54.569 region:rollup3
causing me.

01:37:50.198 --> 01:37:55.169 region:rollup3
To have problems with my I. neck

01:37:52.433 --> 01:37:56.237 region:rollup3
if you've never written in a

01:37:54.569 --> 01:37:58.239 region:rollup3
helicopter you're not missing

01:37:55.169 --> 01:38:00.074 region:rollup3
anything.

01:37:56.237 --> 01:38:00.274 region:rollup3
I especially.

01:37:58.239 --> 01:38:02.510 region:rollup3
Especially I think Vietnam War

01:38:00.074 --> 01:38:04.245 region:rollup3
era.

01:38:00.274 --> 01:38:04.812 region:rollup3
That type of helicopters should

01:38:02.510 --> 01:38:06.614 region:rollup3
any rate.

01:38:04.245 --> 01:38:08.750 region:rollup3
Riding in a helicopter and

01:38:04.812 --> 01:38:10.251 region:rollup3
seeing an area called coffee

01:38:06.614 --> 01:38:12.253 region:rollup3
park I don't know if you've all

01:38:08.750 --> 01:38:12.787 region:rollup3
seen that the photo of this

01:38:10.251 --> 01:38:13.254 region:rollup3
place on in Santa Rosa.

01:38:12.253 --> 01:38:16.257 region:rollup3
This is a community of the

01:38:12.787 --> 01:38:18.426 region:rollup3
several flower totally

01:38:13.254 --> 01:38:20.261 region:rollup3
destroyed.

01:38:16.257 --> 01:38:22.463 region:rollup3
By that fire up in Santa Rosa

01:38:18.426 --> 01:38:24.532 region:rollup3
where -- We

01:38:20.261 --> 01:38:26.067 region:rollup3
lost about Decatur nine thousand

01:38:22.463 --> 01:38:28.469 region:rollup3
homes and about forty three

01:38:24.532 --> 01:38:30.238 region:rollup3
lives forty four large.

01:38:26.067 --> 01:38:30.938 region:rollup3
And so it was clear that we had

01:38:28.469 --> 01:38:32.707 region:rollup3
a problem with our emergency

01:38:30.238 --> 01:38:36.144 region:rollup3
alert systems they they were not

01:38:30.938 --> 01:38:36.677 region:rollup3
working of this fire came very

01:38:32.707 --> 01:38:38.579 region:rollup3
quickly it all sounds familiar

01:38:36.144 --> 01:38:38.846 region:rollup3
because it is familiar.

01:38:36.677 --> 01:38:40.481 region:rollup3
And so I was finishing up a

01:38:38.579 --> 01:38:42.650 region:rollup3
hearing.

01:38:38.846 --> 01:38:44.652 region:rollup3
On December fourth on these

01:38:40.481 --> 01:38:46.087 region:rollup3
emergency alert system sent a

01:38:42.650 --> 01:38:46.621 region:rollup3
talking about the fact we really

01:38:44.652 --> 01:38:48.222 region:rollup3
needed to shore this whole

01:38:46.087 --> 01:38:50.491 region:rollup3
process apart nine eleven

01:38:46.621 --> 01:38:52.360 region:rollup3
system.

01:38:48.222 --> 01:38:54.629 region:rollup3
Forty years old I mean basically

01:38:50.491 --> 01:38:58.099 region:rollup3
before the internet --

01:38:52.360 --> 01:38:58.733 region:rollup3
Are universal alert systems well

01:38:54.629 --> 01:39:00.535 region:rollup3
they go too far and not CPAS

01:38:58.099 --> 01:39:02.336 region:rollup3
enough and many of you during

01:38:58.733 --> 01:39:04.305 region:rollup3
the Thomas fire probably got

01:39:00.535 --> 01:39:04.872 region:rollup3
that o'clock in the morning.

01:39:02.336 --> 01:39:06.440 region:rollup3
Alert telling us to evacuate

01:39:04.305 --> 01:39:08.443 region:rollup3
except what they're really

01:39:04.872 --> 01:39:10.111 region:rollup3
trying to still people

01:39:06.440 --> 01:39:12.213 region:rollup3
Carpinteria to evacuate.

01:39:08.443 --> 01:39:14.315 region:rollup3
So our systems clearly --

01:39:10.111 --> 01:39:16.617 region:rollup3
Needed work so I bang the gavel

01:39:12.213 --> 01:39:18.553 region:rollup3
down a five o'clock and said

01:39:14.315 --> 01:39:20.254 region:rollup3
sort of bows fully well it's

01:39:16.617 --> 01:39:20.922 region:rollup3
December hopefully our fire

01:39:18.553 --> 01:39:22.690 region:rollup3
season is.

01:39:20.254 --> 01:39:24.725 region:rollup3
Is pretty well behind us it'll

01:39:20.922 --> 01:39:26.627 region:rollup3
give us a few months to really

01:39:22.690 --> 01:39:28.596 region:rollup3
try to come to grips with this

01:39:24.725 --> 01:39:29.096 region:rollup3
and and get moving to try to

01:39:26.627 --> 01:39:29.397 region:rollup3
correct going forward.

01:39:28.596 --> 01:39:32.266 region:rollup3
An hour and a half later

01:39:29.096 --> 01:39:34.302 region:rollup3
[inaudible]

01:39:29.397 --> 01:39:34.969 region:rollup3
Thomas Firestar.

01:39:32.266 --> 01:39:36.671 region:rollup3
In December actually unheard off

01:39:34.302 --> 01:39:38.539 region:rollup3
that we would have a fire that

01:39:34.969 --> 01:39:40.308 region:rollup3
magnitude in December that

01:39:36.671 --> 01:39:42.276 region:rollup3
burned for forty days and we all

01:39:38.539 --> 01:39:42.743 region:rollup3
experience with that that

01:39:40.308 --> 01:39:46.347 region:rollup3
created so.

01:39:42.276 --> 01:39:46.914 region:rollup3
I have done a bill.

01:39:42.743 --> 01:39:48.282 region:rollup3
That authorizes its SP eight

01:39:46.347 --> 01:39:50.518 region:rollup3
twenty one it's an emergency

01:39:46.914 --> 01:39:51.152 region:rollup3
notification bill.

01:39:48.282 --> 01:39:52.486 region:rollup3
What we discovered and it's the

01:39:50.518 --> 01:39:54.489 region:rollup3
same problem we're still having

01:39:51.152 --> 01:39:56.657 region:rollup3
today in our community people do

01:39:52.486 --> 01:39:58.526 region:rollup3
not sign up?

01:39:54.489 --> 01:39:59.160 region:rollup3
Now granted we had some problems

01:39:56.657 --> 01:40:00.428 region:rollup3
bingo Lita people did sign up

01:39:58.526 --> 01:40:01.028 region:rollup3
and didn't get noticed will deal

01:39:59.160 --> 01:40:02.430 region:rollup3
with that problem.

01:40:00.428 --> 01:40:04.599 region:rollup3
A believing we will deal with

01:40:01.028 --> 01:40:06.734 region:rollup3
that problem.

01:40:02.430 --> 01:40:08.503 region:rollup3
The fact is people aren't

01:40:04.599 --> 01:40:09.136 region:rollup3
signing up well you know you

01:40:06.734 --> 01:40:10.338 region:rollup3
going Google in you get signed

01:40:08.503 --> 01:40:12.573 region:rollup3
up for all sorts of stuff that

01:40:09.136 --> 01:40:13.040 region:rollup3
you don't want to be signed up.

01:40:10.338 --> 01:40:14.809 region:rollup3
For so how about a system where

01:40:12.573 --> 01:40:16.511 region:rollup3
the county candidates

01:40:13.040 --> 01:40:18.613 region:rollup3
discretion.

01:40:14.809 --> 01:40:20.615 region:rollup3
Sign people up to get these

01:40:16.511 --> 01:40:22.416 region:rollup3
emergency alerts by using

01:40:18.613 --> 01:40:24.285 region:rollup3
information based upon your

01:40:20.615 --> 01:40:24.785 region:rollup3
utility bills we know where

01:40:22.416 --> 01:40:26.821 region:rollup3
people live and we know even if

01:40:24.285 --> 01:40:30.424 region:rollup3
their phone numbers are

01:40:24.785 --> 01:40:31.025 region:rollup3
reflective of a NATO five area.

01:40:26.821 --> 01:40:32.460 region:rollup3
So that people will get notice

01:40:30.424 --> 01:40:34.629 region:rollup3
and if they don't want to be

01:40:31.025 --> 01:40:36.697 region:rollup3
part of it they can opt out.

01:40:32.460 --> 01:40:38.499 region:rollup3
But it is an opt in system and

01:40:34.629 --> 01:40:40.401 region:rollup3
dumb a I do believe that we have

01:40:36.697 --> 01:40:42.470 region:rollup3
a lot of support on that from

01:40:38.499 --> 01:40:44.138 region:rollup3
our public safety people you

01:40:40.401 --> 01:40:44.772 region:rollup3
know the job to alert people is.

01:40:42.470 --> 01:40:46.307 region:rollup3
Of the job of law enforcement

01:40:44.138 --> 01:40:48.476 region:rollup3
and I do know that almost all

01:40:44.772 --> 01:40:49.143 region:rollup3
our law enforcement in

01:40:46.307 --> 01:40:54.348 region:rollup3
California supports that.

01:40:48.476 --> 01:40:54.849 region:rollup3
I'm it was mentioned the debris

01:40:49.143 --> 01:40:56.851 region:rollup3
flow the X. India efficient

01:40:54.348 --> 01:40:58.819 region:rollup3
proximate cause issue.

01:40:54.849 --> 01:41:00.421 region:rollup3
That is a Lara California but

01:40:56.851 --> 01:41:02.657 region:rollup3
it's in it's not actually in

01:40:58.819 --> 01:41:03.257 region:rollup3
statute it's the case law that

01:41:00.421 --> 01:41:06.594 region:rollup3
has come down so basically.

01:41:02.657 --> 01:41:08.296 region:rollup3
There is absolutely no doubt

01:41:03.257 --> 01:41:10.698 region:rollup3
that Thomas fire was the cause

01:41:06.594 --> 01:41:12.466 region:rollup3
of the debris flow.

01:41:08.296 --> 01:41:13.134 region:rollup3
And I don't know that they're

01:41:10.698 --> 01:41:14.769 region:rollup3
any insurance companies at this

01:41:12.466 --> 01:41:16.304 region:rollup3
point Tom that are denying that

01:41:13.134 --> 01:41:16.771 region:rollup3
but they're sort of hanging back

01:41:14.769 --> 01:41:18.839 region:rollup3
a little bit from what I gather

01:41:16.304 --> 01:41:20.775 region:rollup3
in when I was here.

01:41:16.771 --> 01:41:22.310 region:rollup3
In January you gave me a list of

01:41:18.839 --> 01:41:24.412 region:rollup3
those companies that were

01:41:20.775 --> 01:41:25.012 region:rollup3
problem and they're still marked

01:41:22.310 --> 01:41:26.347 region:rollup3
in big bold letters and reading

01:41:24.412 --> 01:41:30.685 region:rollup3
could my notebook and I I'm

01:41:25.012 --> 01:41:32.620 region:rollup3
going after those.

01:41:26.347 --> 01:41:33.254 region:rollup3
Companies to pay up but this is

01:41:30.685 --> 01:41:34.355 region:rollup3
such a bill I'm doing SP nine

01:41:32.620 --> 01:41:36.657 region:rollup3
seventeen Skinner actually put

01:41:33.254 --> 01:41:38.526 region:rollup3
this into statute.

01:41:34.355 --> 01:41:40.328 region:rollup3
So that there's no way these

01:41:36.657 --> 01:41:40.861 region:rollup3
companies can get around I'll

01:41:38.526 --> 01:41:42.363 region:rollup3
tell you it's very interesting

01:41:40.328 --> 01:41:42.930 region:rollup3
they're trying very hard

01:41:40.861 --> 01:41:44.498 region:rollup3
undermining.

01:41:42.363 --> 01:41:46.667 region:rollup3
My ability to get this bill

01:41:42.930 --> 01:41:48.769 region:rollup3
passed --

01:41:44.498 --> 01:41:50.871 region:rollup3
But I am determined and then not

01:41:46.667 --> 01:41:52.673 region:rollup3
the last item I wanted to

01:41:48.769 --> 01:41:54.375 region:rollup3
mention was a bill SP twelve

01:41:50.871 --> 01:41:56.444 region:rollup3
sixty the fire prevention and

01:41:52.673 --> 01:41:57.111 region:rollup3
protection.

01:41:54.375 --> 01:41:58.613 region:rollup3
Which I authored again in part

01:41:56.444 --> 01:42:00.481 region:rollup3
because of the experience that

01:41:57.111 --> 01:42:02.316 region:rollup3
we've had throughout the state

01:41:58.613 --> 01:42:02.917 region:rollup3
in the fact that.

01:42:00.481 --> 01:42:06.587 region:rollup3
It what they didn't mention is

01:42:02.316 --> 01:42:08.389 region:rollup3
that currently California now

01:42:02.917 --> 01:42:12.526 region:rollup3
has. Hundred and thirty eight

01:42:06.587 --> 01:42:14.528 region:rollup3
billion dead trees.

01:42:08.389 --> 01:42:15.162 region:rollup3
Which are about as flammable is

01:42:12.526 --> 01:42:16.597 region:rollup3
anything you can imagine that in

01:42:14.528 --> 01:42:18.866 region:rollup3
there not all up in the forest

01:42:15.162 --> 01:42:20.868 region:rollup3
and moving California.

01:42:16.597 --> 01:42:22.803 region:rollup3
And that its almost impossible

01:42:18.866 --> 01:42:24.672 region:rollup3
to try to cut down all these

01:42:20.868 --> 01:42:26.407 region:rollup3
trees but what we can do in one

01:42:22.803 --> 01:42:28.442 region:rollup3
of the things that this bill

01:42:24.672 --> 01:42:30.544 region:rollup3
doesn't a cheap Peterson mention

01:42:26.407 --> 01:42:31.012 region:rollup3
it serve obliquely but we don't

01:42:28.442 --> 01:42:32.913 region:rollup3
we haven't been doing any burns

01:42:30.544 --> 01:42:34.849 region:rollup3
we have been doing.

01:42:31.012 --> 01:42:36.517 region:rollup3
Any kind of controlled burns in

01:42:32.913 --> 01:42:37.051 region:rollup3
the state because for a lot of

01:42:34.849 --> 01:42:38.753 region:rollup3
good reasons but you know what.

01:42:36.517 --> 01:42:40.888 region:rollup3
We gotta start doing these

01:42:37.051 --> 01:42:42.556 region:rollup3
controlled burns and we're gonna

01:42:38.753 --> 01:42:44.659 region:rollup3
do them as protectively as

01:42:40.888 --> 01:42:46.460 region:rollup3
possible we've brought this bill

01:42:42.556 --> 01:42:48.763 region:rollup3
includes your quality control

01:42:44.659 --> 01:42:50.765 region:rollup3
districts. To to be part of this

01:42:46.460 --> 01:42:51.332 region:rollup3
discussion but if you inhaled

01:42:48.763 --> 01:42:52.566 region:rollup3
those fumes for forty days as

01:42:50.765 --> 01:42:54.835 region:rollup3
many of us did this is not

01:42:51.332 --> 01:42:56.637 region:rollup3
healthy.

01:42:52.566 --> 01:42:58.739 region:rollup3
And we need to do better to

01:42:54.835 --> 01:43:00.808 region:rollup3
manage our forests and that's

01:42:56.637 --> 01:43:02.576 region:rollup3
what SP twelve sixty does using

01:42:58.739 --> 01:43:04.545 region:rollup3
the experts you you saw some of

01:43:00.808 --> 01:43:05.179 region:rollup3
them here with no yes you saw

01:43:02.576 --> 01:43:06.981 region:rollup3
them locally --

01:43:04.545 --> 01:43:07.548 region:rollup3
Dealing with the fact that we

01:43:05.179 --> 01:43:10.484 region:rollup3
have a wildlife urban interface

01:43:06.981 --> 01:43:11.152 region:rollup3
we called the Wu we which is

01:43:07.548 --> 01:43:14.488 region:rollup3
job.

01:43:10.484 --> 01:43:15.122 region:rollup3
Different than the forests up in

01:43:11.152 --> 01:43:16.557 region:rollup3
northern.

01:43:14.488 --> 01:43:18.826 region:rollup3
It's a very different chaparral

01:43:15.122 --> 01:43:20.428 region:rollup3
is different I and what we're

01:43:16.557 --> 01:43:22.830 region:rollup3
doing is bringing together these

01:43:18.826 --> 01:43:23.431 region:rollup3
experts to figure out a plan to

01:43:20.428 --> 01:43:24.398 region:rollup3
try to thin the forests. To thin

01:43:22.830 --> 01:43:26.467 region:rollup3
the area so that we don't end

01:43:23.431 --> 01:43:28.469 region:rollup3
up.

01:43:24.398 --> 01:43:30.771 region:rollup3
Standing there watching

01:43:26.467 --> 01:43:32.606 region:rollup3
helplessly and with great trauma

01:43:28.469 --> 01:43:35.009 region:rollup3
as that fire moved from Santa

01:43:30.771 --> 01:43:36.677 region:rollup3
Paula.

01:43:32.606 --> 01:43:38.746 region:rollup3
All the way to the back country

01:43:35.009 --> 01:43:40.715 region:rollup3
in in Montecito in Santa Barbara

01:43:36.677 --> 01:43:43.017 region:rollup3
we've got to do better that is

01:43:38.746 --> 01:43:44.752 region:rollup3
part of that is the of the curse

01:43:40.715 --> 01:43:46.687 region:rollup3
of the climate change that we're

01:43:43.017 --> 01:43:47.054 region:rollup3
experiencing this those droughts

01:43:44.752 --> 01:43:48.856 region:rollup3
the bark beetles to things that

01:43:46.687 --> 01:43:50.691 region:rollup3
are destroying.

01:43:47.054 --> 01:43:52.593 region:rollup3
Our forest destroying our

01:43:48.856 --> 01:43:55.062 region:rollup3
chaparral and we've got to

01:43:50.691 --> 01:43:56.597 region:rollup3
address that problem so that's

01:43:52.593 --> 01:43:57.231 region:rollup3
SP twelve sixty the governor put

01:43:55.062 --> 01:43:58.933 region:rollup3
a hundred and sixty million

01:43:56.597 --> 01:44:00.668 region:rollup3
dollars into the budget this

01:43:57.231 --> 01:44:04.638 region:rollup3
year for this long term forest

01:43:58.933 --> 01:44:06.674 region:rollup3
health and wildlife a wildfire.

01:44:00.668 --> 01:44:07.308 region:rollup3
Resiliency including of money

01:44:04.638 --> 01:44:07.475 region:rollup3
for it we estimate about hundred

01:44:06.674 --> 01:44:10.711 region:rollup3
twenty million will go for this

01:44:07.308 --> 01:44:12.446 region:rollup3
so.

01:44:07.475 --> 01:44:14.448 region:rollup3
The state is putting money in --

01:44:10.711 --> 01:44:16.584 region:rollup3
We have are working

01:44:12.446 --> 01:44:18.586 region:rollup3
collaboratively and I think --

01:44:14.448 --> 01:44:19.186 region:rollup3
Yes under values.

01:44:16.584 --> 01:44:20.988 region:rollup3
The county.

01:44:18.586 --> 01:44:22.890 region:rollup3
Has never really experienced

01:44:19.186 --> 01:44:24.625 region:rollup3
anything like this before but oh

01:44:20.988 --> 01:44:28.462 region:rollup3
yes house the office of

01:44:22.890 --> 01:44:29.063 region:rollup3
emergency services state so

01:44:24.625 --> 01:44:32.600 region:rollup3
coming together working in the

01:44:28.462 --> 01:44:34.668 region:rollup3
emergency management program

01:44:29.063 --> 01:44:36.570 region:rollup3
with a with Roth.

01:44:32.600 --> 01:44:38.739 region:rollup3
I in in the others who have

01:44:34.668 --> 01:44:39.306 region:rollup3
dealt with some fires and we we

01:44:36.570 --> 01:44:42.576 region:rollup3
are somewhat experienced in them

01:44:38.739 --> 01:44:42.776 region:rollup3
here in California and it in

01:44:39.306 --> 01:44:44.745 region:rollup3
locally but this was an event

01:44:42.576 --> 01:44:46.847 region:rollup3
that.

01:44:42.776 --> 01:44:47.515 region:rollup3
Was so complex.

01:44:44.745 --> 01:44:49.016 region:rollup3
That it did that market would do

01:44:46.847 --> 01:44:52.787 region:rollup3
choose the head of the office of

01:44:47.515 --> 01:44:53.420 region:rollup3
emergency services who was a

01:44:49.016 --> 01:44:54.989 region:rollup3
rock star --

01:44:52.787 --> 01:44:56.624 region:rollup3
It set at had worked with the

01:44:53.420 --> 01:44:59.059 region:rollup3
Jamie Lee I. what's his name

01:44:54.989 --> 01:45:02.763 region:rollup3
Jamie.

01:44:56.624 --> 01:45:04.798 region:rollup3
Jamie Lee Witt who was a double

01:44:59.059 --> 01:45:05.332 region:rollup3
also rockstar --

01:45:02.763 --> 01:45:06.934 region:rollup3
It's it in all the years of

01:45:04.798 --> 01:45:08.536 region:rollup3
twenty five years that.

01:45:05.332 --> 01:45:12.673 region:rollup3
He's been working on fires he

01:45:06.934 --> 01:45:13.174 region:rollup3
said this is the most complex.

01:45:08.536 --> 01:45:14.875 region:rollup3
A event he's ever experienced so

01:45:12.673 --> 01:45:16.677 region:rollup3
bringing together this

01:45:13.174 --> 01:45:18.679 region:rollup3
collaborative effort with the

01:45:14.875 --> 01:45:20.648 region:rollup3
state with the feds FEMA was

01:45:16.677 --> 01:45:22.783 region:rollup3
there for us --

01:45:18.679 --> 01:45:24.518 region:rollup3
We got a huge amount of money a

01:45:20.648 --> 01:45:26.921 region:rollup3
again money is critical because

01:45:22.783 --> 01:45:28.622 region:rollup3
if we have to take money for

01:45:24.518 --> 01:45:30.691 region:rollup3
these fires that we could and

01:45:26.921 --> 01:45:30.991 region:rollup3
should be using for a variety of

01:45:28.622 --> 01:45:32.793 region:rollup3
services within this community.

01:45:30.691 --> 01:45:34.862 region:rollup3
Up we are.

01:45:30.991 --> 01:45:35.496 region:rollup3

01:47:01.348 --> 01:47:05.552 region:rollup3
question we may or may not.

Have the capacity to answer

01:47:04.952 --> 01:47:09.356 region:rollup3
questions and we can try to

01:47:05.552 --> 01:47:11.191 region:rollup3
answer those questions but again

01:47:07.221 --> 01:47:13.127 region:rollup3
this is the opportunity for you

01:47:09.356 --> 01:47:15.129 region:rollup3
at to get anything you'd like

01:47:11.191 --> 01:47:16.897 region:rollup3
into the legislative record.

01:47:13.127 --> 01:47:18.932 region:rollup3
And please state your name --

01:47:15.129 --> 01:47:22.703 region:rollup3
First [inaudible]

01:47:16.897 --> 01:47:24.805 region:rollup3
Thank you.

01:47:18.932 --> 01:47:26.807 region:rollup3
My name's Toni spayed or Adams

01:47:22.703 --> 01:47:28.909 region:rollup3
time here run to representing

01:47:24.805 --> 01:47:30.911 region:rollup3
two different groups one so

01:47:26.807 --> 01:47:31.111 region:rollup3
twenty three homeowners on

01:47:28.909 --> 01:47:34.748 region:rollup3
Montecito Vista off Parker pass

01:47:30.911 --> 01:47:36.817 region:rollup3
road.

01:47:31.111 --> 01:47:38.953 region:rollup3
Our first question is.

01:47:34.748 --> 01:47:40.721 region:rollup3
They are related to that county

01:47:36.817 --> 01:47:42.723 region:rollup3
and how.

01:47:38.953 --> 01:47:44.892 region:rollup3
And to get our first responders

01:47:40.721 --> 01:47:46.961 region:rollup3
to live in that community

01:47:42.723 --> 01:47:47.628 region:rollup3
because there's fear with the

01:47:44.892 --> 01:47:48.963 region:rollup3
road closure so many of our

01:47:46.961 --> 01:47:52.733 region:rollup3
first responders live outside of

01:47:47.628 --> 01:47:54.835 region:rollup3
the area.

01:47:48.963 --> 01:47:55.302 region:rollup3
Our second concern is that we

01:47:52.733 --> 01:47:56.870 region:rollup3
attended M. wanna see a Planning

01:47:54.835 --> 01:47:59.006 region:rollup3
Commission a board of

01:47:55.302 --> 01:48:00.708 region:rollup3
supervisors hearing.

01:47:56.870 --> 01:48:02.943 region:rollup3
Joe Cole who's here with us

01:47:59.006 --> 01:48:04.945 region:rollup3
today and chief Heckman we heard

01:48:00.708 --> 01:48:06.714 region:rollup3
their professional consultants

01:48:02.943 --> 01:48:10.985 region:rollup3
report about back burning house

01:48:04.945 --> 01:48:11.585 region:rollup3
for senator Jackson.

01:48:06.714 --> 01:48:13.220 region:rollup3
And thank you for Senate bill

01:48:10.985 --> 01:48:15.189 region:rollup3
twelve sixty however at that

01:48:11.585 --> 01:48:16.890 region:rollup3
hearing there was agreement on a

01:48:13.220 --> 01:48:17.458 region:rollup3
recommendation that sounds are

01:48:15.189 --> 01:48:19.026 region:rollup3
had not been a fire since

01:48:16.890 --> 01:48:20.961 region:rollup3
nineteen thirty three there

01:48:17.458 --> 01:48:23.163 region:rollup3
should be back burning.

01:48:19.026 --> 01:48:24.898 region:rollup3
And there were countless

01:48:20.961 --> 01:48:26.967 region:rollup3
environmentalists to them one to

01:48:23.163 --> 01:48:28.836 region:rollup3
the board of supervisors they

01:48:24.898 --> 01:48:31.005 region:rollup3
don't live among aceto and then

01:48:26.967 --> 01:48:33.173 region:rollup3
where the sufferers.

01:48:28.836 --> 01:48:34.908 region:rollup3
So our our concern is that while

01:48:31.005 --> 01:48:36.710 region:rollup3
we appreciate twelve sixty we

01:48:33.173 --> 01:48:38.946 region:rollup3
have the benefit of that

01:48:34.908 --> 01:48:41.181 region:rollup3
expertise from professionals on

01:48:36.710 --> 01:48:43.117 region:rollup3
a paid consulting report.

01:48:38.946 --> 01:48:44.918 region:rollup3
We lack governance seed also are

01:48:41.181 --> 01:48:46.787 region:rollup3
planning commission listen to

01:48:43.117 --> 01:48:49.089 region:rollup3
our chief but then nothing

01:48:44.918 --> 01:48:50.958 region:rollup3
happened and Nash you see we had

01:48:46.787 --> 01:48:52.926 region:rollup3
a major fire so one of our

01:48:49.089 --> 01:48:54.728 region:rollup3
concerns as legislatures.

01:48:50.958 --> 01:48:57.064 region:rollup3
How do we prevent that from

01:48:52.926 --> 01:48:59.166 region:rollup3
happening again where our local

01:48:54.728 --> 01:49:01.068 region:rollup3
area says we need back burning

01:48:57.064 --> 01:49:02.970 region:rollup3
we have a paid fire department?

01:48:59.166 --> 01:49:04.838 region:rollup3
But then as it goes up the

01:49:01.068 --> 01:49:06.840 region:rollup3
latter were put into peril I

01:49:02.970 --> 01:49:07.374 region:rollup3
speak to you in our neighborhood

01:49:04.838 --> 01:49:08.876 region:rollup3
we been through three fires in

01:49:06.840 --> 01:49:11.011 region:rollup3
nine years evacuated three

01:49:07.374 --> 01:49:12.980 region:rollup3
times.

01:49:08.876 --> 01:49:15.182 region:rollup3
Huge cost to families resulting

01:49:11.011 --> 01:49:18.952 region:rollup3
and Boris says.

01:49:12.980 --> 01:49:20.921 region:rollup3
Children that are adversely

01:49:15.182 --> 01:49:21.622 region:rollup3
affected and we we welcome of

01:49:18.952 --> 01:49:23.424 region:rollup3
legislation to prevent it our

01:49:20.921 --> 01:49:25.225 region:rollup3
other question is we'd like to

01:49:21.622 --> 01:49:27.027 region:rollup3
see legislation so that when

01:49:23.424 --> 01:49:28.896 region:rollup3
donors gave money we have

01:49:25.225 --> 01:49:31.198 region:rollup3
several neighbors are willing to

01:49:27.027 --> 01:49:32.966 region:rollup3
give so significant amounts.

01:49:28.896 --> 01:49:34.768 region:rollup3
And did but the donations

01:49:31.198 --> 01:49:37.037 region:rollup3
somehow went into a black hole

01:49:32.966 --> 01:49:38.772 region:rollup3
we would like to see the local

01:49:34.768 --> 01:49:39.106 region:rollup3
giving stay local so that there

01:49:37.037 --> 01:49:41.041 region:rollup3
Tom accountability and

01:49:38.772 --> 01:49:42.976 region:rollup3
transparency.

01:49:39.106 --> 01:49:45.312 region:rollup3
We have neighbors in my

01:49:41.041 --> 01:49:47.147 region:rollup3
community very concerned that

01:49:42.976 --> 01:49:49.349 region:rollup3
doctors nurses lawyers teachers

01:49:45.312 --> 01:49:50.751 region:rollup3
who were adversely affected by

01:49:47.147 --> 01:49:52.886 region:rollup3
that much slow needed to get the

01:49:49.349 --> 01:49:53.487 region:rollup3
boulders removed.

01:49:50.751 --> 01:49:55.422 region:rollup3
People were willing to give but

01:49:52.886 --> 01:49:56.957 region:rollup3
they do know where their money

01:49:53.487 --> 01:49:57.491 region:rollup3
went so if there's anything you

01:49:55.422 --> 01:50:01.128 region:rollup3
can do.

01:49:56.957 --> 01:50:01.695 region:rollup3
For the in the area of

01:49:57.491 --> 01:50:02.930 region:rollup3
transparency local donors some

01:50:01.128 --> 01:50:05.065 region:rollup3
of the money went to Santa

01:50:01.695 --> 01:50:05.766 region:rollup3
Barbara City College for someone

01:50:02.930 --> 01:50:09.002 region:rollup3
to United Way red cross.

01:50:05.065 --> 01:50:11.004 region:rollup3
And then people stop giving who

01:50:05.766 --> 01:50:11.605 region:rollup3
were willing to give more to

01:50:09.002 --> 01:50:12.873 region:rollup3
help families but there was no

01:50:11.004 --> 01:50:15.008 region:rollup3
accountability are transparent

01:50:11.605 --> 01:50:16.944 region:rollup3
parents C..

01:50:12.873 --> 01:50:18.979 region:rollup3
And then our last question was

01:50:15.008 --> 01:50:21.048 region:rollup3
how will pending legislation

01:50:16.944 --> 01:50:22.983 region:rollup3
help the people in this room.

01:50:18.979 --> 01:50:25.018 region:rollup3
We understand going forward you

01:50:21.048 --> 01:50:27.120 region:rollup3
have great ideas.

01:50:22.983 --> 01:50:27.387 region:rollup3
That at the extension are

01:50:25.018 --> 01:50:31.058 region:rollup3
temporary living expenses what

01:50:27.120 --> 01:50:33.060 region:rollup3
have you.

01:50:27.387 --> 01:50:34.862 region:rollup3
But under contract lower

01:50:31.058 --> 01:50:36.897 region:rollup3
understanding from meeting with

01:50:33.060 --> 01:50:39.066 region:rollup3
independent insurance adjusters

01:50:34.862 --> 01:50:41.268 region:rollup3
and with attorneys.

01:50:36.897 --> 01:50:41.635 region:rollup3
It it then senator Jackson you

01:50:39.066 --> 01:50:43.403 region:rollup3
know this best ping an attorney

01:50:41.268 --> 01:50:45.405 region:rollup3
which I'm not.

01:50:41.635 --> 01:50:48.942 region:rollup3
You can't go retroactive it

01:50:43.403 --> 01:50:51.145 region:rollup3
would be going forward people in

01:50:45.405 --> 01:50:51.745 region:rollup3
this room are concerned and we

01:50:48.942 --> 01:50:52.913 region:rollup3
found that all different

01:50:51.145 --> 01:50:55.249 region:rollup3
insurance companies such all

01:50:51.745 --> 01:50:55.816 region:rollup3
different contracts.

01:50:52.913 --> 01:50:59.019 region:rollup3
But again to to help our

01:50:55.249 --> 01:51:00.954 region:rollup3
community he'll we'd like to

01:50:55.816 --> 01:51:03.123 region:rollup3
see.

01:50:59.019 --> 01:51:03.390 region:rollup3
Something it where not might not

01:51:00.954 --> 01:51:05.392 region:rollup3
be possible to help them and if

01:51:03.123 --> 01:51:07.194 region:rollup3
we can't.

01:51:03.390 --> 01:51:09.062 region:rollup3
Be retroactive then again

01:51:05.392 --> 01:51:11.431 region:rollup3
through donations or we can

01:51:07.194 --> 01:51:11.698 region:rollup3
ensure that the people who lived

01:51:09.062 --> 01:51:13.367 region:rollup3
here before the debris flow on

01:51:11.431 --> 01:51:15.435 region:rollup3
the fire.

01:51:11.698 --> 01:51:17.137 region:rollup3
Can return to our community and

01:51:13.367 --> 01:51:19.273 region:rollup3
then our goal is to make sure

01:51:15.435 --> 01:51:21.175 region:rollup3
that our first responders live

01:51:17.137 --> 01:51:23.143 region:rollup3
on this side of wherever disrobe

01:51:19.273 --> 01:51:23.610 region:rollup3
closure may be.

01:51:21.175 --> 01:51:25.212 region:rollup3
So that when something happens

01:51:23.143 --> 01:51:27.447 region:rollup3
we can have all those

01:51:23.610 --> 01:51:29.082 region:rollup3
firefighters nurses doctors

01:51:25.212 --> 01:51:29.683 region:rollup3
whoever we need law enforcement

01:51:27.447 --> 01:51:32.986 region:rollup3
officers.

01:51:29.082 --> 01:51:37.090 region:rollup3
In our community thank you for

01:51:29.683 --> 01:51:37.658 region:rollup3
your time.

01:51:32.986 --> 01:51:38.992 region:rollup3
Well let let me try to answer.

01:51:37.090 --> 01:51:41.261 region:rollup3
That was a lot of very good

01:51:37.658 --> 01:51:41.828 region:rollup3
questions.

01:51:38.992 --> 01:51:43.330 region:rollup3
Our first responders living on

01:51:41.261 --> 01:51:45.098 region:rollup3
in on the side of the hill

01:51:41.828 --> 01:51:45.699 region:rollup3
that's a housing issue that's a

01:51:43.330 --> 01:51:47.434 region:rollup3
real challenge.

01:51:45.098 --> 01:51:49.570 region:rollup3
What we did here was the pre

01:51:45.699 --> 01:51:51.538 region:rollup3
positioning so you get this red

01:51:47.434 --> 01:51:51.838 region:rollup3
flag alert and I remember Friday

01:51:49.570 --> 01:51:53.207 region:rollup3
evening I was headed toward

01:51:51.538 --> 01:51:55.042 region:rollup3
carbon via?

01:51:51.838 --> 01:51:58.979 region:rollup3
And saw all these --

01:51:53.207 --> 01:52:01.148 region:rollup3
Yes trucks --

01:51:55.042 --> 01:52:02.983 region:rollup3
Trucks from long fire trucks who

01:51:58.979 --> 01:52:05.052 region:rollup3
had pre positioned here so arm

01:52:01.148 --> 01:52:07.187 region:rollup3
onto the housing issue is sort

01:52:02.983 --> 01:52:09.256 region:rollup3
of a battle on its own --

01:52:05.052 --> 01:52:09.890 region:rollup3
But certainly it would be very

01:52:07.187 --> 01:52:11.124 region:rollup3
helpful to people were able to

01:52:09.256 --> 01:52:11.758 region:rollup3
leave here but that's an issue

01:52:09.890 --> 01:52:13.460 region:rollup3
that.

01:52:11.124 --> 01:52:15.128 region:rollup3
Thing is going to take a bunch

01:52:11.758 --> 01:52:17.097 region:rollup3
of time to to Richard I just

01:52:13.460 --> 01:52:17.731 region:rollup3
want to add all the vacant house

01:52:15.128 --> 01:52:19.466 region:rollup3
in Samana C. alike to my

01:52:17.097 --> 01:52:21.168 region:rollup3
neighborhood there's six on my

01:52:17.731 --> 01:52:21.802 region:rollup3
street all the people said they

01:52:19.466 --> 01:52:23.036 region:rollup3
would offer their homes for

01:52:21.168 --> 01:52:25.138 region:rollup3
first responders to make sure

01:52:21.802 --> 01:52:27.174 region:rollup3
they could stay.

01:52:23.036 --> 01:52:28.909 region:rollup3
Here because we know hotels

01:52:25.138 --> 01:52:31.011 region:rollup3
become commodity were Woodland

01:52:27.174 --> 01:52:33.113 region:rollup3
Hills were deployed to but maybe

01:52:28.909 --> 01:52:33.580 region:rollup3
we could have a central place

01:52:31.011 --> 01:52:35.582 region:rollup3
for people who have three four

01:52:33.113 --> 01:52:36.216 region:rollup3
eight bedroom homes.

01:52:33.580 --> 01:52:37.551 region:rollup3
They were willing to make them

01:52:35.582 --> 01:52:39.319 region:rollup3
available what we didn't know

01:52:36.216 --> 01:52:41.054 region:rollup3
who to call what to do so that's

01:52:37.551 --> 01:52:45.325 region:rollup3
just the point perhaps the

01:52:39.319 --> 01:52:45.959 region:rollup3
county can have of something.

01:52:41.054 --> 01:52:47.060 region:rollup3
Available to it in terms of

01:52:45.325 --> 01:52:49.129 region:rollup3
short term or term housing for

01:52:45.959 --> 01:52:51.398 region:rollup3
first first.

01:52:47.060 --> 01:52:53.467 region:rollup3
As far as donors --

01:52:49.129 --> 01:52:57.170 region:rollup3
That's a challenge I know United

01:52:51.398 --> 01:52:59.106 region:rollup3
Way red cross they accept

01:52:53.467 --> 01:53:01.174 region:rollup3
contributions a the goal for all

01:52:57.170 --> 01:53:01.808 region:rollup3
the services so probably the

01:52:59.106 --> 01:53:03.477 region:rollup3
money that was spent putting in

01:53:01.174 --> 01:53:03.777 region:rollup3
some of these facilities here

01:53:01.808 --> 01:53:05.345 region:rollup3
was money that others had given

01:53:03.477 --> 01:53:07.447 region:rollup3
previously.

01:53:03.777 --> 01:53:09.616 region:rollup3
Are I think there can be

01:53:05.345 --> 01:53:11.451 region:rollup3
instances where nonprofits are

01:53:07.447 --> 01:53:13.220 region:rollup3
set up locally for very specific

01:53:09.616 --> 01:53:15.188 region:rollup3
purposes they just have to

01:53:11.451 --> 01:53:16.990 region:rollup3
create them.

01:53:13.220 --> 01:53:19.426 region:rollup3
And the last thing --

01:53:15.188 --> 01:53:21.094 region:rollup3
With the the controlled burns

01:53:16.990 --> 01:53:25.198 region:rollup3
and all up my my measure I. is

01:53:19.426 --> 01:53:29.136 region:rollup3
designed --

01:53:21.094 --> 01:53:29.703 region:rollup3
To basically prioritize I and

01:53:25.198 --> 01:53:31.038 region:rollup3
this will allow cal fire to the

01:53:29.136 --> 01:53:33.407 region:rollup3
to prioritize based on risk

01:53:29.703 --> 01:53:35.375 region:rollup3
reduction.

01:53:31.038 --> 01:53:37.311 region:rollup3
And that's part of what this is

01:53:33.407 --> 01:53:39.346 region:rollup3
going to be they'll up work with

01:53:35.375 --> 01:53:39.746 region:rollup3
all stakeholders to plan the

01:53:37.311 --> 01:53:41.515 region:rollup3
fuel reduction in the least

01:53:39.346 --> 01:53:43.383 region:rollup3
impactful way --

01:53:39.746 --> 01:53:45.452 region:rollup3
Including the impact of the

01:53:41.515 --> 01:53:47.120 region:rollup3
environment but the bottom line

01:53:43.383 --> 01:53:49.356 region:rollup3
is -- The

01:53:45.452 --> 01:53:51.458 region:rollup3
choices are between a controlled

01:53:47.120 --> 01:53:53.160 region:rollup3
small burn or an uncontrolled

01:53:49.356 --> 01:53:53.794 region:rollup3
big wildfire and obviously we

01:53:51.458 --> 01:53:55.629 region:rollup3
have got to go for the former.

01:53:53.160 --> 01:53:57.264 region:rollup3
Rather than the latter that's

01:53:53.794 --> 01:53:59.232 region:rollup3
the reason I've done the bill

01:53:55.629 --> 01:54:01.134 region:rollup3
and I think that.

01:53:57.264 --> 01:54:01.768 region:rollup3
I think we all recognize again

01:53:59.232 --> 01:54:03.070 region:rollup3
with the nature of these fires

01:54:01.134 --> 01:54:03.670 region:rollup3
we've gotta do more controlled

01:54:01.768 --> 01:54:07.107 region:rollup3
burns.

01:54:03.070 --> 01:54:09.609 region:rollup3
But at and intelligently so

01:54:03.670 --> 01:54:11.311 region:rollup3
that's my hope.

01:54:07.107 --> 01:54:12.012 region:rollup3
The the you know and we agree I

01:54:09.609 --> 01:54:13.513 region:rollup3
think that they a couple things

01:54:11.311 --> 01:54:15.315 region:rollup3
that I'd like to add in terms of

01:54:12.012 --> 01:54:17.217 region:rollup3
the housing situation by there

01:54:13.513 --> 01:54:17.417 region:rollup3
are temporary things that we can

01:54:15.315 --> 01:54:19.386 region:rollup3
do for short term in and on mid

01:54:17.217 --> 01:54:21.521 region:rollup3
term.

01:54:17.417 --> 01:54:23.523 region:rollup3
Housing options for first

01:54:19.386 --> 01:54:24.124 region:rollup3
responders on this November I.

01:54:21.521 --> 01:54:27.260 region:rollup3
California will see a couple

01:54:23.523 --> 01:54:29.262 region:rollup3
ballot initiatives that deal

01:54:24.124 --> 01:54:31.431 region:rollup3
with housing and on if it is the

01:54:27.260 --> 01:54:32.032 region:rollup3
hope of this community to see a

01:54:29.262 --> 01:54:33.600 region:rollup3
long term solution.

01:54:31.431 --> 01:54:35.702 region:rollup3
When local communities whether

01:54:32.032 --> 01:54:37.437 region:rollup3
it county or city are developing

01:54:33.600 --> 01:54:39.406 region:rollup3
housing plans and have housing

01:54:35.702 --> 01:54:41.508 region:rollup3
initiatives and I would highly

01:54:37.437 --> 01:54:43.443 region:rollup3
suggest that that voice be?

01:54:39.406 --> 01:54:45.378 region:rollup3
A voice that's out there we talk

01:54:41.508 --> 01:54:45.912 region:rollup3
about affordable housing housing

01:54:43.443 --> 01:54:47.647 region:rollup3
for veterans on and if housing

01:54:45.378 --> 01:54:49.382 region:rollup3
for first responders is

01:54:45.912 --> 01:54:49.983 region:rollup3
something the community wants we

01:54:47.647 --> 01:54:51.351 region:rollup3
may have that opportunity to

01:54:49.382 --> 01:54:55.122 region:rollup3
think about this in the long

01:54:49.983 --> 01:54:57.257 region:rollup3
term.

01:54:51.351 --> 01:54:57.791 region:rollup3
While we experienced it on fire

01:54:55.122 --> 01:54:59.326 region:rollup3
and for the debris flows it's

01:54:57.257 --> 01:54:59.893 region:rollup3
not the first time we've

01:54:57.791 --> 01:55:01.261 region:rollup3
experienced it we also

01:54:59.326 --> 01:55:03.163 region:rollup3
experienced it for the la

01:54:59.893 --> 01:55:03.764 region:rollup3
Conchita mudslides.

01:55:01.261 --> 01:55:07.234 region:rollup3
On and we have we have

01:55:03.163 --> 01:55:07.734 region:rollup3
consistently seemed at first

01:55:03.764 --> 01:55:09.336 region:rollup3
responders among also on

01:55:07.234 --> 01:55:11.271 region:rollup3
education for you know

01:55:07.734 --> 01:55:13.373 region:rollup3
professionals --

01:55:09.336 --> 01:55:14.040 region:rollup3
Health professionals I'm are not

01:55:11.271 --> 01:55:15.575 region:rollup3
living in the communities where

01:55:13.373 --> 01:55:17.577 region:rollup3
they work and this is one of the

01:55:14.040 --> 01:55:19.546 region:rollup3
long term consequences of

01:55:15.575 --> 01:55:21.815 region:rollup3
individuals who cannot afford to

01:55:17.577 --> 01:55:23.483 region:rollup3
live in the community C. work.

01:55:19.546 --> 01:55:25.552 region:rollup3
Out so I will say that we will

01:55:21.815 --> 01:55:29.122 region:rollup3
have an as community the

01:55:23.483 --> 01:55:31.391 region:rollup3
opportunity to address this if

01:55:25.552 --> 01:55:33.193 region:rollup3
we go to our cities and also.

01:55:29.122 --> 01:55:35.495 region:rollup3
To our counties and when housing

01:55:31.391 --> 01:55:35.762 region:rollup3
projects are being built and ask

01:55:33.193 --> 01:55:37.631 region:rollup3
is there an opportunity to

01:55:35.495 --> 01:55:39.666 region:rollup3
include.

01:55:35.762 --> 01:55:41.601 region:rollup3
XML units in this particular

01:55:37.631 --> 01:55:43.336 region:rollup3
project for first responders

01:55:39.666 --> 01:55:45.338 region:rollup3
with considered work for housing

01:55:41.601 --> 01:55:45.772 region:rollup3
and so I will add that and I

01:55:43.336 --> 01:55:47.407 region:rollup3
think that that's something that

01:55:45.338 --> 01:55:49.609 region:rollup3
we can definitely.

01:55:45.772 --> 01:55:51.144 region:rollup3
Of as well in the future --

01:55:47.407 --> 01:55:51.812 region:rollup3
In terms of that as someone M.

01:55:49.609 --> 01:55:53.613 region:rollup3
who chairs the select committee

01:55:51.144 --> 01:55:55.615 region:rollup3
for the nonprofit sector there's

01:55:51.812 --> 01:55:57.484 region:rollup3
definitely room to keep having

01:55:53.613 --> 01:55:59.319 region:rollup3
conversations about donations

01:55:55.615 --> 01:56:01.421 region:rollup3
and how we keep donations local.

01:55:57.484 --> 01:56:03.390 region:rollup3
And how we ensure that there's a

01:55:59.319 --> 01:56:05.559 region:rollup3
network I'm that is able to

01:56:01.421 --> 01:56:06.026 region:rollup3
provide information at to our

01:56:03.390 --> 01:56:07.661 region:rollup3
local community that were local

01:56:05.559 --> 01:56:09.296 region:rollup3
donations are going.

01:56:06.026 --> 01:56:09.830 region:rollup3
Out I I just wanted to add those

01:56:07.661 --> 01:56:11.298 region:rollup3
pieces.

01:56:09.296 --> 01:56:11.965 region:rollup3
I don't have anyone in the

01:56:09.830 --> 01:56:13.600 region:rollup3
county wants.

01:56:11.298 --> 01:56:17.404 region:rollup3
I'll go on to the next question

01:56:11.965 --> 01:56:18.038 region:rollup3
or comment and I think we can

01:56:13.600 --> 01:56:19.840 region:rollup3
win here and then.

01:56:17.404 --> 01:56:21.475 region:rollup3
My name is Cindy Marcus and I

01:56:18.038 --> 01:56:23.510 region:rollup3
want to address your issue of

01:56:19.840 --> 01:56:25.812 region:rollup3
people signing up for the aware

01:56:21.475 --> 01:56:31.384 region:rollup3
and prepare I am signed up for

01:56:23.510 --> 01:56:33.486 region:rollup3
all of them and I was getting.

01:56:25.812 --> 01:56:35.222 region:rollup3
Loads of alerts and but there

01:56:31.384 --> 01:56:37.457 region:rollup3
was no phone service a land line

01:56:33.486 --> 01:56:39.426 region:rollup3
service no cellphone service.

01:56:35.222 --> 01:56:41.561 region:rollup3
And I was dependent on that I I

01:56:37.457 --> 01:56:42.195 region:rollup3
was waiting for the alert you to

01:56:39.426 --> 01:56:43.430 region:rollup3
know what to do and once the

01:56:41.561 --> 01:56:45.232 region:rollup3
phone service one out there was

01:56:42.195 --> 01:56:47.601 region:rollup3
no alert we have.

01:56:43.430 --> 01:56:51.304 region:rollup3
Power we admit.

01:56:45.232 --> 01:56:53.406 region:rollup3
No nothing so is there something

01:56:47.601 --> 01:56:54.074 region:rollup3
to do in that certain so --

01:56:51.304 --> 01:56:55.675 region:rollup3
Yes -- And

01:56:53.406 --> 01:56:56.243 region:rollup3
part of this hearing that I was

01:56:54.074 --> 01:56:59.479 region:rollup3
doing in December fourth was to

01:56:55.675 --> 01:57:01.615 region:rollup3
address the fact that our

01:56:56.243 --> 01:57:03.416 region:rollup3
wireless services do nothing.

01:56:59.479 --> 01:57:05.585 region:rollup3
Or very little --

01:57:01.615 --> 01:57:07.387 region:rollup3
They've got to of be --

01:57:03.416 --> 01:57:09.322 region:rollup3
Present in this discussion

01:57:05.585 --> 01:57:09.623 region:rollup3
because Vera fewer and fewer

01:57:07.387 --> 01:57:13.493 region:rollup3
people are having landline

01:57:09.322 --> 01:57:14.127 region:rollup3
[inaudible]

01:57:09.623 --> 01:57:15.462 region:rollup3
And right and so.

01:57:13.493 --> 01:57:17.397 region:rollup3
I mean land lines we're working

01:57:14.127 --> 01:57:19.432 region:rollup3
--

01:57:15.462 --> 01:57:21.534 region:rollup3
Or people were getting notices

01:57:17.397 --> 01:57:23.470 region:rollup3
that were not accurate --

01:57:19.432 --> 01:57:25.472 region:rollup3
We need to do we need to create

01:57:21.534 --> 01:57:27.474 region:rollup3
a twenty first century

01:57:23.470 --> 01:57:28.108 region:rollup3
technologically appropriate

01:57:25.472 --> 01:57:29.509 region:rollup3
warning system back in the old

01:57:27.474 --> 01:57:31.478 region:rollup3
days the warning was the church

01:57:28.108 --> 01:57:32.045 region:rollup3
bells.

01:57:29.509 --> 01:57:33.647 region:rollup3
We don't have that anymore but

01:57:31.478 --> 01:57:35.649 region:rollup3
we do have technology that

01:57:32.045 --> 01:57:37.284 region:rollup3
should be as effective if not

01:57:33.647 --> 01:57:37.584 region:rollup3
more effective there's G. O.

01:57:35.649 --> 01:57:39.619 region:rollup3
fencing that they're talking

01:57:37.284 --> 01:57:43.590 region:rollup3
about now.

01:57:37.584 --> 01:57:45.492 region:rollup3
There's also to G. P. S. type

01:57:39.619 --> 01:57:46.059 region:rollup3
our options are but the private

01:57:43.590 --> 01:57:47.561 region:rollup3
sector the profit driven private

01:57:45.492 --> 01:57:49.763 region:rollup3
sector is not particularly

01:57:46.059 --> 01:57:50.397 region:rollup3
interested in this --

01:57:47.561 --> 01:57:50.697 region:rollup3
We've got to get their interest

01:57:49.763 --> 01:57:59.673 region:rollup3
and we're trying to work on that

01:57:50.397 --> 01:58:01.641 region:rollup3
[inaudible]

01:57:50.697 --> 01:58:05.412 region:rollup3
Yes.

01:57:59.673 --> 01:58:05.712 region:rollup3
First a comment then some

01:58:01.641 --> 01:58:09.349 region:rollup3
comments and questions

01:58:05.412 --> 01:58:11.351 region:rollup3
[inaudible]

01:58:05.712 --> 01:58:13.787 region:rollup3
George Bush New Orleans.

01:58:09.349 --> 01:58:15.455 region:rollup3
Hannah Beth Jackson.

01:58:11.351 --> 01:58:17.557 region:rollup3
Toni Collette mon and dos

01:58:13.787 --> 01:58:19.826 region:rollup3
Williams minus ito.

01:58:15.455 --> 01:58:21.561 region:rollup3
Elections make a difference.

01:58:17.557 --> 01:58:23.797 region:rollup3
And I thank you all for your

01:58:19.826 --> 01:58:25.365 region:rollup3
participation.

01:58:21.561 --> 01:58:27.467 region:rollup3
My first question is monitoring

01:58:23.797 --> 01:58:29.469 region:rollup3
equipment was mentioned.

01:58:25.365 --> 01:58:31.705 region:rollup3
Of being stalled.

01:58:27.467 --> 01:58:32.339 region:rollup3
I'm curious what so.

01:58:29.469 --> 01:58:32.939 region:rollup3
We're just John that is I do not

01:58:31.705 --> 01:58:33.573 region:rollup3
think this is the appropriate

01:58:32.339 --> 01:58:35.742 region:rollup3
time and place for that since

01:58:32.939 --> 01:58:37.477 region:rollup3
it.

01:58:33.573 --> 01:58:38.111 region:rollup3
Sounds like it might be quite

01:58:35.742 --> 01:58:39.479 region:rollup3
extensive.

01:58:37.477 --> 01:58:41.381 region:rollup3
But I'm hoping that you could

01:58:38.111 --> 01:58:43.550 region:rollup3
schedule a hearing in the

01:58:39.479 --> 01:58:45.552 region:rollup3
appropriate humanities.

01:58:41.381 --> 01:58:47.554 region:rollup3
So the public comment like me

01:58:43.550 --> 01:58:49.689 region:rollup3
with wacky ideas --

01:58:45.552 --> 01:58:51.624 region:rollup3
Can come portion present my

01:58:47.554 --> 01:58:53.426 region:rollup3
wacko ideas --

01:58:49.689 --> 01:58:54.094 region:rollup3
For example like you know the

01:58:51.624 --> 01:58:57.530 region:rollup3
oil separation.

01:58:53.426 --> 01:58:58.098 region:rollup3
How could be done by centrifugal

01:58:54.094 --> 01:58:59.599 region:rollup3
force rather than?

01:58:57.530 --> 01:59:01.568 region:rollup3
You know nowadays that don't

01:58:58.098 --> 01:59:03.303 region:rollup3
work --

01:58:59.599 --> 01:59:05.438 region:rollup3
Second of all --

01:59:01.568 --> 01:59:05.939 region:rollup3
I've heard a lot about property

01:59:03.303 --> 01:59:07.641 region:rollup3
owners and government but I have

01:59:05.438 --> 01:59:08.274 region:rollup3
not heard anything about

01:59:05.939 --> 01:59:10.010 region:rollup3
mentors.

01:59:07.641 --> 01:59:11.444 region:rollup3
I am a member of the rental

01:59:08.274 --> 01:59:13.580 region:rollup3
housing mediation board for the

01:59:10.010 --> 01:59:14.147 region:rollup3
city's Santa Barbara.

01:59:11.444 --> 01:59:14.714 region:rollup3
What's going on with matters you

01:59:13.580 --> 01:59:17.650 region:rollup3
how are they being assisted

01:59:14.147 --> 01:59:21.454 region:rollup3
what's what's going on with

01:59:14.714 --> 01:59:23.556 region:rollup3
that.

01:59:17.650 --> 01:59:25.558 region:rollup3
Here's my wacko idea.

01:59:21.454 --> 01:59:27.660 region:rollup3
I watch the planes.

01:59:23.556 --> 01:59:29.462 region:rollup3
Go into the lake and it.

01:59:25.558 --> 01:59:31.698 region:rollup3
Scoop up water.

01:59:27.660 --> 01:59:33.933 region:rollup3
Golden fire scene and dump it.

01:59:29.462 --> 01:59:34.534 region:rollup3
It seemed to be a little more

01:59:31.698 --> 01:59:35.568 region:rollup3
ineffective me trying to put out

01:59:33.933 --> 01:59:37.771 region:rollup3
the fire in my fireplace by

01:59:34.534 --> 01:59:41.708 region:rollup3
spitting on it.

01:59:35.568 --> 01:59:43.543 region:rollup3
What I'm thinking is would it

01:59:37.771 --> 01:59:45.545 region:rollup3
not be cheaper? To have along --

01:59:41.708 --> 01:59:47.714 region:rollup3
To even though it's five miles

01:59:43.543 --> 01:59:49.482 region:rollup3
long they could deliver fire

01:59:45.545 --> 01:59:51.551 region:rollup3
hydrant force in volume --

01:59:47.714 --> 01:59:51.851 region:rollup3
That local.

01:59:49.482 --> 01:59:53.586 region:rollup3
No household water supplies

01:59:51.551 --> 01:59:55.588 region:rollup3
[inaudible]

01:59:51.851 --> 01:59:57.757 region:rollup3
Cannot.

01:59:53.586 --> 01:59:59.959 region:rollup3
So I lay that I mean.

01:59:55.588 --> 02:00:01.728 region:rollup3
Boy those guys sure could use a

01:59:57.757 --> 02:00:02.228 region:rollup3
lot of water at the scene of the

01:59:59.959 --> 02:00:04.097 region:rollup3
fire and I think it could make a

02:00:01.728 --> 02:00:05.632 region:rollup3
significant difference.

02:00:02.228 --> 02:00:07.534 region:rollup3
If we could transfer the water

02:00:04.097 --> 02:00:09.736 region:rollup3
that's in the lake. To the fire

02:00:05.632 --> 02:00:11.738 region:rollup3
expeditiously.

02:00:07.534 --> 02:00:13.606 region:rollup3
Thanks thank you end it you know

02:00:09.736 --> 02:00:17.577 region:rollup3
the month this subgroup the

02:00:11.738 --> 02:00:19.512 region:rollup3
Montecito --

02:00:13.606 --> 02:00:20.146 region:rollup3
Group whose name I the

02:00:17.577 --> 02:00:21.915 region:rollup3
resiliency committee I'm sure

02:00:19.512 --> 02:00:22.515 region:rollup3
would be delighted to hear some

02:00:20.146 --> 02:00:27.987 region:rollup3
of your comments well that's it

02:00:21.915 --> 02:00:28.254 region:rollup3
I mean it's just a brainstorm

02:00:22.515 --> 02:00:29.889 region:rollup3
and have no qualifications to

02:00:27.987 --> 02:00:31.658 region:rollup3
back up.

02:00:28.254 --> 02:00:33.993 region:rollup3
Other than being wacko --

02:00:29.889 --> 02:00:35.962 region:rollup3
We we C. idea.

02:00:31.658 --> 02:00:37.797 region:rollup3
I think you and I do wanna say

02:00:33.993 --> 02:00:39.766 region:rollup3
M. I am referencing the document

02:00:35.962 --> 02:00:41.735 region:rollup3
we have about all the bills that

02:00:37.797 --> 02:00:42.368 region:rollup3
were introduced in one of those

02:00:39.766 --> 02:00:43.670 region:rollup3
bills that was introduced by a

02:00:41.735 --> 02:00:45.739 region:rollup3
colleague in the assembly is

02:00:42.368 --> 02:00:47.540 region:rollup3
only member would.

02:00:43.670 --> 02:00:49.542 region:rollup3
I'm was AB nineteen ninety and

02:00:45.739 --> 02:00:51.845 region:rollup3
the bill prohibits price gouging

02:00:47.540 --> 02:00:52.512 region:rollup3
of the rental housing that was

02:00:49.542 --> 02:00:53.680 region:rollup3
not on the market at the time of

02:00:51.845 --> 02:00:55.748 region:rollup3
the proclamation our declaration

02:00:52.512 --> 02:00:57.751 region:rollup3
of emergency.

02:00:53.680 --> 02:01:00.019 region:rollup3
And so currently the like this

02:00:55.748 --> 02:01:03.656 region:rollup3
for up property that was on the

02:00:57.751 --> 02:01:05.492 region:rollup3
market I'm during that time and

02:01:00.019 --> 02:01:06.192 region:rollup3
so this is an expansion I'm of

02:01:03.656 --> 02:01:07.761 region:rollup3
of protection for renters so I

02:01:05.492 --> 02:01:08.328 region:rollup3
wanted to mention that that bill

02:01:06.192 --> 02:01:09.596 region:rollup3
is currently in Senate

02:01:07.761 --> 02:01:10.130 region:rollup3
appropriations so it's still

02:01:08.328 --> 02:01:11.931 region:rollup3
alive.

02:01:09.596 --> 02:01:12.532 region:rollup3
Well I. encourage you to

02:01:10.130 --> 02:01:15.668 region:rollup3
encourage staff to contact the

02:01:11.931 --> 02:01:17.704 region:rollup3
rental housing mediation board

02:01:12.532 --> 02:01:19.906 region:rollup3
--

02:01:15.668 --> 02:01:21.808 region:rollup3
Mr Fano.

02:01:17.704 --> 02:01:23.676 region:rollup3
And on safe you can coordinate

02:01:19.906 --> 02:01:24.310 region:rollup3
you get some kind of notice put

02:01:21.808 --> 02:01:25.912 region:rollup3
on your publications that this

02:01:23.676 --> 02:01:39.726 region:rollup3
is a service that is available.

02:01:24.310 --> 02:01:40.360 region:rollup3
And encouraged us willing to put

02:01:25.912 --> 02:01:41.828 region:rollup3
the county on the contract.

02:01:39.726 --> 02:01:45.932 region:rollup3
My name is Lawrence Thompson.

02:01:40.360 --> 02:01:46.566 region:rollup3
Our local architect.

02:01:41.828 --> 02:01:47.967 region:rollup3
And since it I. two thousand

02:01:45.932 --> 02:01:50.036 region:rollup3
thirteen I've been in liaison

02:01:46.566 --> 02:01:51.671 region:rollup3
with county fire on the idea.

02:01:47.967 --> 02:01:53.773 region:rollup3
Of putting a fire helicopter

02:01:50.036 --> 02:01:55.775 region:rollup3
operation.

02:01:51.671 --> 02:01:56.442 region:rollup3
Right near Marcy.

02:01:53.773 --> 02:01:58.044 region:rollup3
To because we have over a

02:01:55.775 --> 02:02:01.481 region:rollup3
hundred miles between sanity and

02:01:56.442 --> 02:02:04.017 region:rollup3
as and the Ventura county

02:01:58.044 --> 02:02:05.685 region:rollup3
operations.

02:02:01.481 --> 02:02:05.985 region:rollup3
And it takes them typically over

02:02:04.017 --> 02:02:07.587 region:rollup3
half an hour with their ten and

02:02:05.685 --> 02:02:10.056 region:rollup3
it -- Launch

02:02:05.985 --> 02:02:11.691 region:rollup3
time. To get down here.

02:02:07.587 --> 02:02:13.860 region:rollup3
Whereas we have put together an

02:02:10.056 --> 02:02:14.527 region:rollup3
operation.

02:02:11.691 --> 02:02:16.196 region:rollup3
That would launch in four

02:02:13.860 --> 02:02:19.699 region:rollup3
minutes Andy probably anywhere

02:02:14.527 --> 02:02:20.333 region:rollup3
in Lara Seto wasn't within ten

02:02:16.196 --> 02:02:22.101 region:rollup3
maybe even eight minutes.

02:02:19.699 --> 02:02:23.803 region:rollup3
The difference of course is

02:02:20.333 --> 02:02:25.905 region:rollup3
light years in terms of fire

02:02:22.101 --> 02:02:27.707 region:rollup3
growth obviously with the Tom

02:02:23.803 --> 02:02:29.676 region:rollup3
aspire being so well developed

02:02:25.905 --> 02:02:30.210 region:rollup3
it wouldn't.

02:02:27.707 --> 02:02:32.111 region:rollup3
Make much difference other than

02:02:29.676 --> 02:02:33.813 region:rollup3
augmenting the Hartford.

02:02:30.210 --> 02:02:35.882 region:rollup3
But as with the recent holiday

02:02:32.111 --> 02:02:36.516 region:rollup3
fire.

02:02:33.813 --> 02:02:37.851 region:rollup3
And other fires that are do the

02:02:35.882 --> 02:02:41.688 region:rollup3
Sundowners which need immediate

02:02:36.516 --> 02:02:42.055 region:rollup3
response it would make a

02:02:37.851 --> 02:02:43.723 region:rollup3
terrific difference the problem

02:02:41.688 --> 02:02:44.290 region:rollup3
we're having is.

02:02:42.055 --> 02:02:45.825 region:rollup3
Money.

02:02:43.723 --> 02:02:47.927 region:rollup3
The county does not have the

02:02:44.290 --> 02:02:49.662 region:rollup3
money.

02:02:45.825 --> 02:02:51.764 region:rollup3
And I understand that in course

02:02:47.927 --> 02:02:54.100 region:rollup3
even the fire departments who

02:02:49.662 --> 02:02:55.635 region:rollup3
are operate tremendous effort --

02:02:51.764 --> 02:02:57.637 region:rollup3
They need more money just to do

02:02:54.100 --> 02:02:58.271 region:rollup3
what they're doing now.

02:02:55.635 --> 02:03:00.073 region:rollup3
Yeah so this is the problem I

02:02:57.637 --> 02:03:01.874 region:rollup3
have one individual who would.

02:02:58.271 --> 02:03:02.408 region:rollup3
Come up with a half a million

02:03:00.073 --> 02:03:05.678 region:rollup3
dollars cash to reduce one point

02:03:01.874 --> 02:03:07.847 region:rollup3
eight million dollar your

02:03:02.408 --> 02:03:08.414 region:rollup3
project --

02:03:05.678 --> 02:03:09.782 region:rollup3
But I'd have to match to get him

02:03:07.847 --> 02:03:12.085 region:rollup3
to bring that money and the

02:03:08.414 --> 02:03:13.686 region:rollup3
question is.

02:03:09.782 --> 02:03:15.989 region:rollup3
Is there anything such at the

02:03:12.085 --> 02:03:16.656 region:rollup3
state level.

02:03:13.686 --> 02:03:19.692 region:rollup3
Is there anything in terms of

02:03:15.989 --> 02:03:22.028 region:rollup3
the insurance companies who have

02:03:16.656 --> 02:03:23.696 region:rollup3
contacted.

02:03:19.692 --> 02:03:25.899 region:rollup3
Who could join together? To help

02:03:22.028 --> 02:03:27.800 region:rollup3
augment this we have how many.

02:03:23.696 --> 02:03:29.669 region:rollup3
Hundred billion dollars for the

02:03:25.899 --> 02:03:31.905 region:rollup3
real estate here.

02:03:27.800 --> 02:03:33.740 region:rollup3
And yet we have the RP

02:03:29.669 --> 02:03:34.374 region:rollup3
helicopters in Santa Ynez.

02:03:31.905 --> 02:03:35.708 region:rollup3
That's it's very responsible we

02:03:33.740 --> 02:03:38.311 region:rollup3
have a big county in there right

02:03:34.374 --> 02:03:39.913 region:rollup3
in the middle.

02:03:35.708 --> 02:03:40.480 region:rollup3
But as with the Josh hasn't seen

02:03:38.311 --> 02:03:41.714 region:rollup3
a fire.

02:03:39.913 --> 02:03:44.384 region:rollup3
They weren't in the Bates at

02:03:40.480 --> 02:03:45.818 region:rollup3
that time.

02:03:41.714 --> 02:03:46.319 region:rollup3
And by the time the helicopters

02:03:44.384 --> 02:03:47.720 region:rollup3
got there the wind was too

02:03:45.818 --> 02:03:48.354 region:rollup3
strong they couldn't do

02:03:46.319 --> 02:03:49.722 region:rollup3
anything.

02:03:47.720 --> 02:03:51.824 region:rollup3
But the response time was like

02:03:48.354 --> 02:03:51.991 region:rollup3
ninety minutes.

02:03:49.722 --> 02:03:54.127 region:rollup3
That's a light here.

02:03:51.824 --> 02:03:58.231 region:rollup3
So.

02:03:51.991 --> 02:03:58.564 region:rollup3
Might Mike frustration is even

02:03:54.127 --> 02:03:59.732 region:rollup3
though a she Peterson's Gimme a

02:03:58.231 --> 02:04:02.068 region:rollup3
kind letter.

02:03:58.564 --> 02:04:02.368 region:rollup3
I. supporting this says.

02:03:59.732 --> 02:04:03.636 region:rollup3
Are there other agencies out of

02:04:02.068 --> 02:04:06.372 region:rollup3
the county.

02:04:02.368 --> 02:04:09.709 region:rollup3
The Cannella bog Neptis.

02:04:03.636 --> 02:04:11.711 region:rollup3
And bring us to a point where

02:04:06.372 --> 02:04:13.813 region:rollup3
the the enormous of

02:04:09.709 --> 02:04:14.113 region:rollup3
preponderance of work of worth

02:04:11.711 --> 02:04:17.684 region:rollup3
in terms of property exists

02:04:13.813 --> 02:04:19.886 region:rollup3
[inaudible]

02:04:14.113 --> 02:04:23.823 region:rollup3
Thank you.

02:04:17.684 --> 02:04:24.457 region:rollup3
At you know I I look at our fire

02:04:19.886 --> 02:04:25.825 region:rollup3
folks and in the back and and

02:04:23.823 --> 02:04:27.660 region:rollup3
welcome them if they want to

02:04:24.457 --> 02:04:29.762 region:rollup3
respond I do you want to

02:04:25.825 --> 02:04:30.363 region:rollup3
describe a little bit about how

02:04:27.660 --> 02:04:31.798 region:rollup3
state funding works and when

02:04:29.762 --> 02:04:34.033 region:rollup3
we've been able to share with

02:04:30.363 --> 02:04:36.002 region:rollup3
you have.

02:04:31.798 --> 02:04:37.937 region:rollup3
Some additional funding that has

02:04:34.033 --> 02:04:39.839 region:rollup3
been brought by the state and we

02:04:36.002 --> 02:04:40.406 region:rollup3
have worked with the county to

02:04:37.937 --> 02:04:43.676 region:rollup3
identify the priorities --

02:04:39.839 --> 02:04:44.310 region:rollup3
We work with cities with

02:04:40.406 --> 02:04:44.510 region:rollup3
counties with our municipalities

02:04:43.676 --> 02:04:45.979 region:rollup3
to identify what the priorities

02:04:44.310 --> 02:04:48.181 region:rollup3
are.

02:04:44.510 --> 02:04:50.149 region:rollup3
And certainly our request being

02:04:45.979 --> 02:04:52.385 region:rollup3
greater than what we've been

02:04:48.181 --> 02:04:53.720 region:rollup3
able to and bring to you but and

02:04:50.149 --> 02:04:55.688 region:rollup3
this does become a challenge for

02:04:52.385 --> 02:04:56.322 region:rollup3
us that.

02:04:53.720 --> 02:04:58.191 region:rollup3
We are looking at where we are

02:04:55.688 --> 02:05:00.293 region:rollup3
where we are at M. also the

02:04:56.322 --> 02:05:01.994 region:rollup3
direction that being given to us

02:04:58.191 --> 02:05:02.195 region:rollup3
on at the local level as well in

02:05:00.293 --> 02:05:03.896 region:rollup3
terms of what those priorities

02:05:01.994 --> 02:05:05.765 region:rollup3
are.

02:05:02.195 --> 02:05:06.432 region:rollup3
If that was something that was a

02:05:03.896 --> 02:05:08.101 region:rollup3
priority for the county F. or

02:05:05.765 --> 02:05:09.736 region:rollup3
the city it does mean there's

02:05:06.432 --> 02:05:12.171 region:rollup3
tradeoffs there is nothing that

02:05:08.101 --> 02:05:14.073 region:rollup3
is done without trade offs.

02:05:09.736 --> 02:05:16.008 region:rollup3
On we would you know welcome to

02:05:12.171 --> 02:05:18.011 region:rollup3
how that conversation on a but

02:05:14.073 --> 02:05:18.611 region:rollup3
that is something that we would

02:05:16.008 --> 02:05:19.979 region:rollup3
have to that really work with

02:05:18.011 --> 02:05:22.048 region:rollup3
the county and the cities to

02:05:18.611 --> 02:05:24.050 region:rollup3
understand where does the

02:05:19.979 --> 02:05:26.185 region:rollup3
following terms of the priority.

02:05:22.048 --> 02:05:26.686 region:rollup3
It has been made clear to espy

02:05:24.050 --> 02:05:30.023 region:rollup3
at I think our local

02:05:26.185 --> 02:05:31.991 region:rollup3
municipalities at their

02:05:26.686 --> 02:05:32.592 region:rollup3
priorities at this moment is --

02:05:30.023 --> 02:05:33.793 region:rollup3
Immediate recovery --

02:05:31.991 --> 02:05:36.062 region:rollup3
Long term or mid term planning

02:05:32.592 --> 02:05:36.529 region:rollup3
--

02:05:33.793 --> 02:05:37.964 region:rollup3
Is something that we're trying

02:05:36.062 --> 02:05:39.665 region:rollup3
to get to Beth are are

02:05:36.529 --> 02:05:42.335 region:rollup3
communities have made it very

02:05:37.964 --> 02:05:42.902 region:rollup3
clear that some of the backfill

02:05:39.665 --> 02:05:43.970 region:rollup3
on related to so much that has

02:05:42.335 --> 02:05:45.905 region:rollup3
been lost here is is the

02:05:42.902 --> 02:05:48.141 region:rollup3
immediate priority.

02:05:43.970 --> 02:05:50.209 region:rollup3
I'm I don't know if anyone.

02:05:45.905 --> 02:05:51.911 region:rollup3
I eight think that this is where

02:05:48.141 --> 02:05:53.880 region:rollup3
we're at certainly I'm if there

02:05:50.209 --> 02:05:54.547 region:rollup3
are agencies whether it's a

02:05:51.911 --> 02:05:56.215 region:rollup3
public private private

02:05:53.880 --> 02:05:58.017 region:rollup3
partnerships that are willing to

02:05:54.547 --> 02:06:00.153 region:rollup3
explore a and we would be happy

02:05:56.215 --> 02:06:02.021 region:rollup3
to think about that.

02:05:58.017 --> 02:06:03.790 region:rollup3
Bombing connect those agencies

02:06:00.153 --> 02:06:06.092 region:rollup3
should we identify them.

02:06:02.021 --> 02:06:06.626 region:rollup3
Yeah I think these were all very

02:06:03.790 --> 02:06:08.194 region:rollup3
excellent suggestions if we have

02:06:06.092 --> 02:06:08.728 region:rollup3
people who are willing to

02:06:06.626 --> 02:06:10.263 region:rollup3
contribute but they want to make

02:06:08.194 --> 02:06:13.966 region:rollup3
sure the money is going.

02:06:08.728 --> 02:06:15.935 region:rollup3
Where they wanted to go in

02:06:10.263 --> 02:06:16.469 region:rollup3
[inaudible] To go --

02:06:13.966 --> 02:06:18.070 region:rollup3
We again.

02:06:15.935 --> 02:06:20.173 region:rollup3
The whole notion of public

02:06:16.469 --> 02:06:22.074 region:rollup3
private partnerships is where we

02:06:18.070 --> 02:06:23.810 region:rollup3
have to go both statewide in

02:06:20.173 --> 02:06:24.510 region:rollup3
federally it's the you know it's

02:06:22.074 --> 02:06:26.179 region:rollup3
the public --

02:06:23.810 --> 02:06:28.247 region:rollup3
Trough gets less and less on the

02:06:24.510 --> 02:06:30.149 region:rollup3
federal level because of all

02:06:26.179 --> 02:06:31.818 region:rollup3
these tax giveaways the

02:06:28.247 --> 02:06:32.351 region:rollup3
reduction of the ability of our

02:06:30.149 --> 02:06:33.953 region:rollup3
federal government to provide

02:06:31.818 --> 02:06:34.554 region:rollup3
services is only going to

02:06:32.351 --> 02:06:36.289 region:rollup3
increase.

02:06:33.953 --> 02:06:37.957 region:rollup3
Of the state has had a pretty

02:06:34.554 --> 02:06:40.092 region:rollup3
good run recently but the

02:06:36.289 --> 02:06:42.028 region:rollup3
economy.

02:06:37.957 --> 02:06:42.695 region:rollup3
What goes up will come down so

02:06:40.092 --> 02:06:44.197 region:rollup3
if there are some suggestions

02:06:42.028 --> 02:06:46.132 region:rollup3
and then again coordinating with

02:06:42.695 --> 02:06:48.134 region:rollup3
our -- First

02:06:44.197 --> 02:06:49.969 region:rollup3
responders they know best what

02:06:46.132 --> 02:06:50.570 region:rollup3
is the most efficient use of

02:06:48.134 --> 02:06:51.971 region:rollup3
those dollars.

02:06:49.969 --> 02:06:52.605 region:rollup3
Conversation absolutely worth

02:06:50.570 --> 02:06:56.342 region:rollup3
having.

02:06:51.971 --> 02:07:01.881 region:rollup3
We had this one woman here who.

02:06:52.605 --> 02:07:04.217 region:rollup3
Was wanted to come on up don't

02:06:56.342 --> 02:07:04.851 region:rollup3
don't be shy.

02:07:01.881 --> 02:07:06.018 region:rollup3
My name is Lee M. Palmer I'm

02:07:04.217 --> 02:07:07.987 region:rollup3
actually a good leader resonant

02:07:04.851 --> 02:07:11.791 region:rollup3
--

02:07:06.018 --> 02:07:14.093 region:rollup3
First I'd like to think.

02:07:07.987 --> 02:07:16.262 region:rollup3
Wanders for Friday night.

02:07:11.791 --> 02:07:17.897 region:rollup3
Was not anything like this but

02:07:14.093 --> 02:07:20.199 region:rollup3
it wasn't [inaudible]

02:07:16.262 --> 02:07:22.135 region:rollup3
Good -- In a

02:07:17.897 --> 02:07:24.103 region:rollup3
poll of over fifty of my

02:07:20.199 --> 02:07:25.872 region:rollup3
neighbors on the neighborhood.

02:07:22.135 --> 02:07:28.141 region:rollup3
Out in the area directly

02:07:24.103 --> 02:07:30.476 region:rollup3
affected I was well as co

02:07:25.872 --> 02:07:31.944 region:rollup3
workers that live all over town.

02:07:28.141 --> 02:07:34.380 region:rollup3
We did not receive any alerts we

02:07:30.476 --> 02:07:36.048 region:rollup3
were all signed up.

02:07:31.944 --> 02:07:36.716 region:rollup3
Now that one change that has

02:07:34.380 --> 02:07:38.050 region:rollup3
happened.

02:07:36.048 --> 02:07:41.954 region:rollup3
Since we all signed up for these

02:07:36.716 --> 02:07:44.290 region:rollup3
things.

02:07:38.050 --> 02:07:46.359 region:rollup3
Is the eight oh five issue.

02:07:41.954 --> 02:07:49.829 region:rollup3
I wonder if anyone has

02:07:44.290 --> 02:07:52.265 region:rollup3
investigated with however that

02:07:46.359 --> 02:07:54.367 region:rollup3
worked because when I signed

02:07:49.829 --> 02:07:56.435 region:rollup3
back up as it all my neighbors

02:07:52.265 --> 02:07:57.870 region:rollup3
after we got done evacuated and

02:07:54.367 --> 02:07:59.939 region:rollup3
coming back home and I know it

02:07:56.435 --> 02:08:00.573 region:rollup3
was small.

02:07:57.870 --> 02:08:01.974 region:rollup3
Compared to what money Seto went

02:07:59.939 --> 02:08:04.110 region:rollup3
through but it could have been

02:08:00.573 --> 02:08:06.212 region:rollup3
worse.

02:08:01.974 --> 02:08:08.314 region:rollup3
I wonder if anyone has

02:08:04.110 --> 02:08:08.881 region:rollup3
investigated if Scott affected

02:08:06.212 --> 02:08:10.550 region:rollup3
us because the only thing that

02:08:08.314 --> 02:08:14.186 region:rollup3
came through to me was news

02:08:08.881 --> 02:08:16.122 region:rollup3
hawk.

02:08:10.550 --> 02:08:18.357 region:rollup3
And I got air every single.

02:08:14.186 --> 02:08:20.092 region:rollup3
Surveying over this fired the

02:08:16.122 --> 02:08:20.693 region:rollup3
Whittier fire everywhere so I

02:08:18.357 --> 02:08:22.094 region:rollup3
wonder about that.

02:08:20.092 --> 02:08:25.965 region:rollup3
And the second comment I have

02:08:20.693 --> 02:08:28.000 region:rollup3
is.

02:08:22.094 --> 02:08:28.634 region:rollup3
I'm old enough to remember and

02:08:25.965 --> 02:08:32.104 region:rollup3
most people in this room.

02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:34.073 region:rollup3
The emergency broadcast system

02:08:28.634 --> 02:08:36.309 region:rollup3
test.

02:08:32.104 --> 02:08:40.112 region:rollup3
With the obnoxious noise that

02:08:34.073 --> 02:08:42.081 region:rollup3
used to come over the TV.

02:08:36.309 --> 02:08:43.916 region:rollup3
Has anyone ever considered.

02:08:40.112 --> 02:08:46.018 region:rollup3
Before we have the next disaster

02:08:42.081 --> 02:08:48.120 region:rollup3
to test.

02:08:43.916 --> 02:08:49.956 region:rollup3
The reverse.

02:08:46.018 --> 02:08:52.325 region:rollup3
Nine one one the Nick sleep.

02:08:48.120 --> 02:08:54.060 region:rollup3
The Santa Barbara county.

02:08:49.956 --> 02:08:56.562 region:rollup3
Do a test notify everybody we're

02:08:52.325 --> 02:08:58.664 region:rollup3
going to do a test.

02:08:54.060 --> 02:09:00.666 region:rollup3
And see what happens because you

02:08:56.562 --> 02:09:02.168 region:rollup3
don't find the holes until the

02:08:58.664 --> 02:09:04.470 region:rollup3
people are scrambling around in

02:09:00.666 --> 02:09:05.972 region:rollup3
the dark.

02:09:02.168 --> 02:09:08.107 region:rollup3
Trying to figure out what

02:09:04.470 --> 02:09:08.774 region:rollup3
happened.

02:09:05.972 --> 02:09:12.278 region:rollup3
So since you are on that

02:09:08.107 --> 02:09:12.745 region:rollup3
committee maybe we can implement

02:09:08.774 --> 02:09:14.213 region:rollup3
this and maybe if we have

02:09:12.278 --> 02:09:15.982 region:rollup3
another just faster.

02:09:12.745 --> 02:09:18.050 region:rollup3
Our community will get timely

02:09:14.213 --> 02:09:20.119 region:rollup3
notice.

02:09:15.982 --> 02:09:22.288 region:rollup3
Thank you is shy --

02:09:18.050 --> 02:09:24.223 region:rollup3
Pulled out the article --

02:09:20.119 --> 02:09:26.125 region:rollup3
The Tyler Hayden wrote a I guess

02:09:22.288 --> 02:09:30.062 region:rollup3
it was yesterday --

02:09:24.223 --> 02:09:30.730 region:rollup3
Very distressing --

02:09:26.125 --> 02:09:32.164 region:rollup3
And I'm sure the county is going

02:09:30.062 --> 02:09:32.465 region:rollup3
to take a very deep dive into

02:09:30.730 --> 02:09:36.002 region:rollup3
that and I will as well

02:09:32.164 --> 02:09:38.437 region:rollup3
[inaudible]

02:09:32.465 --> 02:09:40.539 region:rollup3
Because there's really.

02:09:36.002 --> 02:09:42.441 region:rollup3
Not no excuse for for that

02:09:38.437 --> 02:09:44.443 region:rollup3
fortunately no one was killed.

02:09:40.539 --> 02:09:46.112 region:rollup3
Arm the sheriff's office to go

02:09:42.441 --> 02:09:48.214 region:rollup3
door to door which I think

02:09:44.443 --> 02:09:48.914 region:rollup3
helped.

02:09:46.112 --> 02:09:49.482 region:rollup3
Did not go to your door.

02:09:48.214 --> 02:09:52.118 region:rollup3
Well I have friends that live on

02:09:48.914 --> 02:09:54.020 region:rollup3
north Fairview in an area I

02:09:49.482 --> 02:09:56.455 region:rollup3
lost.

02:09:52.118 --> 02:09:58.124 region:rollup3
Friends who lost their homes.

02:09:54.020 --> 02:10:00.026 region:rollup3
Nobody went door to door people

02:09:56.455 --> 02:10:02.628 region:rollup3
fled.

02:09:58.124 --> 02:10:03.996 region:rollup3
Well I think there was no way

02:10:00.026 --> 02:10:06.232 region:rollup3
for them to get up there to go

02:10:02.628 --> 02:10:08.267 region:rollup3
door to door the immediate

02:10:03.996 --> 02:10:10.636 region:rollup3
neighborhood south.

02:10:06.232 --> 02:10:12.038 region:rollup3
Of cathedral oaks there were no

02:10:08.267 --> 02:10:16.142 region:rollup3
deputies going door to door they

02:10:10.636 --> 02:10:18.110 region:rollup3
were doing the best they can.

02:10:12.038 --> 02:10:18.778 region:rollup3
They can't go door to door that.

02:10:16.142 --> 02:10:20.279 region:rollup3
Well I I think that we will be

02:10:18.110 --> 02:10:22.148 region:rollup3
taking a very hard look at this

02:10:18.778 --> 02:10:24.116 region:rollup3
I think your suggestion has

02:10:20.279 --> 02:10:26.185 region:rollup3
merit to it as well.

02:10:22.148 --> 02:10:26.786 region:rollup3
We do have the technology today

02:10:24.116 --> 02:10:27.420 region:rollup3
we just have to apply it and I

02:10:26.185 --> 02:10:32.291 region:rollup3
think those who are very good

02:10:26.786 --> 02:10:34.560 region:rollup3
questions and thank you for that

02:10:27.420 --> 02:10:40.099 region:rollup3
thank you.

02:10:32.291 --> 02:10:42.601 region:rollup3
Any last questions [inaudible]

02:10:34.560 --> 02:10:44.470 region:rollup3
Rundown.

02:10:40.099 --> 02:10:46.105 region:rollup3
Hello my name is Jeff harms

02:10:46.105 --> 02:10:52.345 region:rollup3
I'm landscape architect --

02:10:48.174 --> 02:10:53.012 region:rollup3
I have a question regarding

02:10:50.176 --> 02:10:54.113 region:rollup3
forest management --

02:10:52.345 --> 02:10:56.482 region:rollup3
I think that it's something that

02:10:53.012 --> 02:10:58.584 region:rollup3
actually.

02:10:54.113 --> 02:11:00.186 region:rollup3
Hit some a lot of these points

02:10:56.482 --> 02:11:04.090 region:rollup3
here and I think it's really

02:10:58.584 --> 02:11:06.292 region:rollup3
important --

02:11:00.186 --> 02:11:08.127 region:rollup3
Well my question is is what kind

02:11:04.090 --> 02:11:08.794 region:rollup3
of management are we going to go

02:11:06.292 --> 02:11:10.629 region:rollup3
forward with.

02:11:08.127 --> 02:11:11.197 region:rollup3
You no we started off with Mike

02:11:08.794 --> 02:11:12.331 region:rollup3
Smokey the bear management we

02:11:10.629 --> 02:11:16.369 region:rollup3
all come to know that didn't

02:11:11.197 --> 02:11:17.036 region:rollup3
work.

02:11:12.331 --> 02:11:18.437 region:rollup3
And now we're going to the you

02:11:16.369 --> 02:11:20.339 region:rollup3
know the weed Wacker thing we're

02:11:17.036 --> 02:11:22.108 region:rollup3
removing everything from the

02:11:18.437 --> 02:11:24.510 region:rollup3
forest.

02:11:20.339 --> 02:11:26.412 region:rollup3
But there are more modern ways

02:11:22.108 --> 02:11:28.147 region:rollup3
of doing in worried too

02:11:24.510 --> 02:11:30.449 region:rollup3
rewilding things and they

02:11:26.412 --> 02:11:32.218 region:rollup3
actually proven to work better.

02:11:28.147 --> 02:11:34.286 region:rollup3
My question is how are we

02:11:30.449 --> 02:11:36.355 region:rollup3
presenting that rather than

02:11:32.218 --> 02:11:37.022 region:rollup3
having a knee jerk reaction as

02:11:34.286 --> 02:11:38.491 region:rollup3
to what we're going to do.

02:11:36.355 --> 02:11:40.526 region:rollup3
I Wilk presenting that as let's

02:11:37.022 --> 02:11:42.528 region:rollup3
go forward with the modern way

02:11:38.491 --> 02:11:44.263 region:rollup3
of doing things of the better

02:11:40.526 --> 02:11:44.764 region:rollup3
progressive way of doing things

02:11:42.528 --> 02:11:48.367 region:rollup3
to make things actually work.

02:11:44.263 --> 02:11:50.803 region:rollup3
And is that part of the

02:11:44.764 --> 02:11:52.138 region:rollup3
legislation thank.

02:11:48.367 --> 02:11:56.175 region:rollup3
A I think you for the question

02:11:50.803 --> 02:11:56.809 region:rollup3
and that is actually the bill

02:11:52.138 --> 02:11:58.244 region:rollup3
that I am I am authoring EP.

02:11:56.175 --> 02:12:00.413 region:rollup3
Nineteen fifty six and it's the

02:11:56.809 --> 02:12:02.348 region:rollup3
year around per I. fire

02:11:58.244 --> 02:12:02.615 region:rollup3
prevention acts M. that cal fire

02:12:00.413 --> 02:12:04.750 region:rollup3
chief alluded to and it does

02:12:02.348 --> 02:12:08.187 region:rollup3
bring --

02:12:02.615 --> 02:12:08.687 region:rollup3
Experts I'm from academia to

02:12:04.750 --> 02:12:10.689 region:rollup3
industry to at first responders

02:12:08.187 --> 02:12:12.858 region:rollup3
to a space to have those

02:12:08.687 --> 02:12:14.560 region:rollup3
conversations I'm not just in

02:12:10.689 --> 02:12:16.395 region:rollup3
terms of what the best practices

02:12:12.858 --> 02:12:18.364 region:rollup3
are in California but looking at

02:12:14.560 --> 02:12:18.697 region:rollup3
it I'm from the world what have

02:12:16.395 --> 02:12:20.332 region:rollup3
we seen in other areas of the

02:12:18.364 --> 02:12:22.768 region:rollup3
world where.

02:12:18.697 --> 02:12:26.338 region:rollup3
And whether it's a wildfire or

02:12:20.332 --> 02:12:28.374 region:rollup3
and flood or anything of the

02:12:22.768 --> 02:12:28.841 region:rollup3
kind what what are the types.

02:12:26.338 --> 02:12:30.709 region:rollup3
M. of and elements that are

02:12:28.374 --> 02:12:32.411 region:rollup3
needed to prevent --

02:12:28.841 --> 02:12:32.745 region:rollup3
These wildfires so I I think you

02:12:30.709 --> 02:12:34.713 region:rollup3
know it looks it vegetation

02:12:32.411 --> 02:12:36.715 region:rollup3
management --

02:12:32.745 --> 02:12:40.519 region:rollup3
On any related educational

02:12:34.713 --> 02:12:42.655 region:rollup3
outreach on you know fire

02:12:36.715 --> 02:12:46.425 region:rollup3
prevention strategy defensible

02:12:40.519 --> 02:12:46.992 region:rollup3
space on retrofitting structures

02:12:42.655 --> 02:12:48.627 region:rollup3
I to it you know anything that

02:12:46.425 --> 02:12:50.763 region:rollup3
increases fire resistance.

02:12:46.992 --> 02:12:52.498 region:rollup3
And so that is something that --

02:12:48.627 --> 02:12:53.065 region:rollup3
Is going to be state it is

02:12:50.763 --> 02:12:54.366 region:rollup3
moving forward the bill is still

02:12:52.498 --> 02:12:56.368 region:rollup3
alive it still has two more

02:12:53.065 --> 02:12:57.036 region:rollup3
steps.

02:12:54.366 --> 02:12:58.604 region:rollup3
And before it gets to the

02:12:56.368 --> 02:13:00.339 region:rollup3
governor's office M. but we do

02:12:57.036 --> 02:13:00.873 region:rollup3
feel confident that it is

02:12:58.604 --> 02:13:02.675 region:rollup3
something that will establish

02:13:00.339 --> 02:13:02.908 region:rollup3
what we used to have in

02:13:00.873 --> 02:13:06.345 region:rollup3
California which was a working

02:13:02.675 --> 02:13:08.414 region:rollup3
group.

02:13:02.908 --> 02:13:09.048 region:rollup3
And reestablish it on the in

02:13:06.345 --> 02:13:10.649 region:rollup3
collaboration with a number of

02:13:08.414 --> 02:13:12.184 region:rollup3
other vehicles that are being

02:13:09.048 --> 02:13:14.153 region:rollup3
used but your points are

02:13:10.649 --> 02:13:14.787 region:rollup3
absolutely well taken.

02:13:12.184 --> 02:13:16.789 region:rollup3
And that there are a number

02:13:14.153 --> 02:13:20.392 region:rollup3
strategies that Smokey the bear

02:13:14.787 --> 02:13:22.228 region:rollup3
was once our image of fire

02:13:16.789 --> 02:13:24.363 region:rollup3
prevention on a Bates I. it is.

02:13:20.392 --> 02:13:25.030 region:rollup3
We have trust me we are far

02:13:22.228 --> 02:13:26.699 region:rollup3
beyond Smokey the bear who I

02:13:24.363 --> 02:13:28.734 region:rollup3
still love anything is Q. Anna

02:13:25.030 --> 02:13:28.934 region:rollup3
but we are far far beyond that

02:13:26.699 --> 02:13:30.870 region:rollup3
in terms of the strategies and

02:13:28.734 --> 02:13:34.406 region:rollup3
I'm.

02:13:28.934 --> 02:13:36.642 region:rollup3
We want to bring that together

02:13:30.870 --> 02:13:38.410 region:rollup3
at the state level.

02:13:34.406 --> 02:13:40.479 region:rollup3
And we if that's I think we are

02:13:36.642 --> 02:13:42.481 region:rollup3
wrapping up.

02:13:38.410 --> 02:13:43.182 region:rollup3
Think so thank you all very much

02:13:40.479 --> 02:13:44.617 region:rollup3
for coming up please will share

02:13:42.481 --> 02:13:46.585 region:rollup3
with us your ideas your thoughts
