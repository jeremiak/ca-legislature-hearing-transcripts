SO YOU -- I I UNDERSTAND.

00:41:45.669 --> 00:41:46.570
WHY THE -- DIFFERENT LOCAL

00:41:46.637 --> 00:41:47.771
GOVERNMENT ASSOCIATIONS CAME TO

00:41:47.838 --> 00:41:48.372
THE TABLE ON OPPOSE THE BILL

00:41:48.439 --> 00:41:51.809

UTILIZE -- THESE FINES AND FEES

00:41:54.979 --> 00:41:56.914
TO COVER COSTS.

00:41:56.981 --> 00:41:59.216
NOW INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH -- IF

00:41:59.283 --> 00:42:01.352
WE LOOK AT ALL THE DIFFERENT

00:42:01.418 --> 00:42:02.720
SERVICES THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT

00:42:02.786 --> 00:42:03.554
PROVIDES [inaudible]

00:42:03.621 --> 00:42:05.189
THERE.

00:42:05.256 --> 00:42:08.158
WE DO NOT ASSESS A FEAR OF FINE

00:42:08.225 --> 00:42:09.593
FOR EVERY SINGLE SERVICE THAT

00:42:09.660 --> 00:42:11.195
LOCAL GOVERNMENT PROVIDES.

00:42:11.262 --> 00:42:12.496
NOW CLEARLY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

00:42:12.563 --> 00:42:14.798
STILL HAVE TO OPERATE -- BUT

00:42:14.865 --> 00:42:17.001
WE'VE SEEN THIS GROWTH IN FEES

00:42:17.067 --> 00:42:19.570
AND FINES ON ALL ALL NATURE

00:42:19.637 --> 00:42:22.473
AREAS -- WHETHER IT'S TRAFFIC

00:42:22.539 --> 00:42:25.442
TICKETS OR ANY NUMBER OF THINGS.

00:42:25.509 --> 00:42:27.344
DUE TO THE FACT THAT -- IT

00:42:27.411 --> 00:42:29.146
BASICALLY RISEN SINCE THE

00:42:29.213 --> 00:42:31.682
PASSAGE OF PROP THIRTEEN BECAUSE

00:42:31.749 --> 00:42:33.617
THEIR CORE REVENUE TO LOCAL

00:42:33.684 --> 00:42:34.585
GOVERNMENTS WAS GUTTED AT THAT

00:42:34.652 --> 00:42:36.620
TIME AND SINCE THAT TIME.

00:42:36.687 --> 00:42:38.155
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE BEEN

00:42:38.222 --> 00:42:39.423
TRYING TO MAKE UP [inaudible]

00:42:39.490 --> 00:42:42.259
AND UNFORTUNATELY MOST FEES AND

00:42:42.326 --> 00:42:44.028
FINES NOT ALL BUT ESPECIALLY

00:42:44.094 --> 00:42:47.431
THOSE. TO DO WITH ANY TYPE OF

00:42:47.498 --> 00:42:49.366
INCARCERATION INFRACTION OR

00:42:49.433 --> 00:42:50.234
CRIMINAL.

00:42:50.301 --> 00:42:51.702
ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY ON LOW

00:42:51.769 --> 00:42:53.270
INCOME PEOPLE BECAUSE

00:42:53.337 --> 00:42:54.171
UNFORTUNATELY IS

00:42:54.238 --> 00:42:55.639
DISPROPORTIONATELY LOW INCOME

00:42:55.706 --> 00:42:57.474
PEOPLE AND PEOPLE OF COLOR WHO

00:42:57.541 --> 00:42:59.877
GET CONVICTED IN THE FIRST PLACE --

00:42:59.944 --> 00:43:02.746
AND DIED WE WE DON'T NEED TO RE

00:43:02.813 --> 00:43:05.015
HASH THAT DATA THAT DATA IS WELL

00:43:05.082 --> 00:43:07.518
BEFORE US IN IS SUBSTANTIATED.

00:43:07.584 --> 00:43:11.755
BY MORE THAN -- THAT BY MOST

00:43:11.822 --> 00:43:12.990
EVERY BIT OF RESEARCH THAT IS

00:43:13.057 --> 00:43:13.524
DONE.

00:43:13.590 --> 00:43:16.126
SO WHILE I APPRECIATE THAT LOCAL

00:43:16.193 --> 00:43:17.995
GOVERNMENTS WOULD BE FRUSTRATED

00:43:18.062 --> 00:43:19.997
THAT THEY WOULD HAVE THESE

00:43:20.064 --> 00:43:21.799
REVENUE SOURCES CUT OFF.

00:43:21.865 --> 00:43:23.667
I THINK THAT WE HAVE FOUND.

00:43:23.734 --> 00:43:24.535
THAT.

00:43:24.601 --> 00:43:26.136
THE COVERING OF THESE COSTS IN

00:43:26.203 --> 00:43:28.439
THIS WAY IS NOT A BENEFIT TO THE

00:43:28.505 --> 00:43:30.708
SOCIETY AT LARGE AND WHEN WE

00:43:30.774 --> 00:43:32.876
HEAR FROM A WITNESS LIKE THE

00:43:32.943 --> 00:43:34.478
GENTLEMAN WHO REPRESENTED ARC.

00:43:34.545 --> 00:43:36.647
WHO TALKS ABOUT?

00:43:36.714 --> 00:43:38.682
AFTER SERVING HIS TIME.

00:43:38.749 --> 00:43:42.653
AND DOING -- WHAT WAS EXPECTED

00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:44.588
OF HIM?

00:43:44.655 --> 00:43:46.323
DUE TO THE CRIME HE COMMITTED.

00:43:46.390 --> 00:43:49.393
BEING RELEASED AND THEN FINDING.

00:43:49.460 --> 00:43:52.830
THAT HE HAS -- SIGNIFICANT COSTS

00:43:52.896 --> 00:43:54.698
THAT HE NOW HAS TO COVER WHICH

00:43:54.765 --> 00:43:56.934
IS WE KNOW YOU ALREADY IF YOU

00:43:57.001 --> 00:43:58.569
COME OUT OF ANY FOR OF

00:43:58.635 --> 00:44:00.304
INCARCERATION WHETHER IT'S

00:44:00.371 --> 00:44:01.772
COUNTY DEALER STATE PRISON.

00:44:01.839 --> 00:44:02.873
YOU HAVE AN ALBATROSS AROUND

00:44:02.940 --> 00:44:04.208
YOUR NECK YOU'RE ALREADY

00:44:04.274 --> 00:44:06.343
DISADVANTAGE IN TERMS OF GETTING

00:44:06.410 --> 00:44:08.278
EMPLOYMENT IN TERMS OF ANY

00:44:08.345 --> 00:44:10.247
NUMBER OF THINGS TO TO BE ABLE

00:44:10.314 --> 00:44:11.982
TO PROPERLY.

00:44:12.049 --> 00:44:13.817
REINTEGRATE INTO A COMMUNITY.

00:44:13.884 --> 00:44:15.552
AND TO ADD TIS ADDITIONAL

00:44:15.619 --> 00:44:16.887
BURDEN.

00:44:16.954 --> 00:44:20.591
I THINK IS -- JUST IT IT DOES

00:44:20.657 --> 00:44:23.027
NOT SERVICE IT IT CREATES IT

00:44:23.093 --> 00:44:25.295
HELPS TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE HIGH

00:44:25.362 --> 00:44:26.730
AMOUNTS OF RECIDIVISM THAT

00:44:26.797 --> 00:44:28.999
CALIFORNIA HAS MEANING PEOPLE

00:44:29.066 --> 00:44:29.533
RETURNING BACK TO JAIL AND

00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:30.334
PRISON.

00:44:30.401 --> 00:44:31.969
AND IT'S SOMETHING WE'RE TRYING

00:44:32.036 --> 00:44:33.871
TO STOP THIS REVOLVING DOOR SO I

00:44:33.937 --> 00:44:35.372
REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR BRINGING

00:44:35.439 --> 00:44:36.407
THE MEASURE.

00:44:36.473 --> 00:44:39.743
AND I THINK THAT WERE WE AS AND

00:44:39.810 --> 00:44:41.011
AS A FORMER REPRESENTATIVE OF

00:44:41.078 --> 00:44:42.513
LOCAL GOVERNMENT WE'RE JUST

00:44:42.579 --> 00:44:44.014
GONNA HAVE TO START FIGURING OUT.

HOW TO PROVIDE OUR SERVICES

WITHOUT CHARGING THESE TYPE OF

00:44:47.384 --> 00:44:48.719
PEACE AND NOW I THINK THAT'S

00:44:48.786 --> 00:44:50.988
JUST A BASIC REALITY OR WE NEED

00:44:51.055 --> 00:44:51.922

00:47:14.231 --> 00:47:15.499
TWO FOLD YOU KNOW.

00:47:15.566 --> 00:47:16.967
IS IT APPROPRIATE FOR US TO

00:47:17.034 --> 00:47:18.535
ASSUME THAT THE ASSESSMENT OF

00:47:18.602 --> 00:47:20.304
FINES AND FEES ARE INDEED A

00:47:20.370 --> 00:47:21.772
DETERRENT.

00:47:21.838 --> 00:47:23.373

ARE AT ARE FAMILIAR WITH PENAL

00:47:31.181 --> 00:47:33.784
CODE -- THAT SUGGESTS THAT WE DO

00:47:33.850 --> 00:47:37.354
HAVE A SYSTEM IN WHICH PEOPLE --

00:47:37.421 --> 00:47:39.990
PAID THEIR DEBT TO SOCIETY AND

00:47:40.057 --> 00:47:41.792
PAID THEIR DEBT TO A VICTIM THIS

00:47:41.858 --> 00:47:43.894
BILL DOES NOT TOUCH RESTITUTION

00:47:43.961 --> 00:47:44.494
I WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S

00:47:44.561 --> 00:47:45.796
CLEAR.

00:47:45.862 --> 00:47:46.730
BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT IT'S

00:47:46.797 --> 00:47:48.565
APPROPRIATE IN AS THE MADAM

00:47:48.632 --> 00:47:50.167
CHAIR SUGGESTED.

00:47:50.234 --> 00:47:51.368

GOVERNMENT IN THE PROVISION OF

00:47:52.769 --> 00:47:53.971
SERVICES THAT GOVERNMENT IS

00:47:54.037 --> 00:47:55.772
RESPONSIBLE.

00:47:55.839 --> 00:47:58.075
FOR THAT WE IN EFFECT ISSUE AN

00:47:58.141 --> 00:47:59.543

ON OUR RESIDENTS TO COVER THOSE

00:48:00.777 --> 00:48:05.682
COSTS -- WE HAVE THE SAME HERE

00:48:05.749 --> 00:48:08.352
DURING THAT TEN YEAR PERIOD WHEN

00:48:08.418 --> 00:48:09.686
OUR BUDGET WAS.

00:48:09.753 --> 00:48:13.423
REALLY DIFFICULT WE WERE CUTTING.

00:48:13.490 --> 00:48:15.826
CRITICAL SERVICES THAT WE

00:48:15.892 --> 00:48:17.628
SHOULDN'T BALANCE THE BUDGET ON

00:48:17.694 --> 00:48:20.063
THE BACKS OF POOR PEOPLE.

00:48:20.130 --> 00:48:22.666
IF YOU COULD SHOW ME A COUNTY

00:48:22.733 --> 00:48:25.535
WHERE THE COLLECTION OF FEES.

00:48:25.602 --> 00:48:27.871
ACTUALLY EXCEEDS THE COST TO

00:48:27.938 --> 00:48:31.975
COLLECT IT. TO CHARGE ADDITIONAL

00:48:32.042 --> 00:48:34.111
I'D AN ADDITIONAL PERCENT FOR

00:48:34.177 --> 00:48:37.014
THE COLLECTION PROCESS -- I

00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:38.081
THINK THAT'S EXCESSIVE AND

00:48:38.148 --> 00:48:38.949
INAPPROPRIATE.

00:48:39.016 --> 00:48:40.917
ALL WE ARE OPEN TO CONTINUING TO

00:48:40.984 --> 00:48:42.653
HAVE THE CONVERSATION TO LOOK AT

00:48:42.719 --> 00:48:44.221
INDIVIDUAL CASES BUT I JUST

00:48:44.288 --> 00:48:46.056
THINK ACROSS THE BOARD WE HAVE

00:48:46.123 --> 00:48:47.491
TO HAVE A FOR THE PHILOSOPHICAL

00:48:47.557 --> 00:48:49.092
CONVERSATION ABOUT WHETHER WE

00:48:49.159 --> 00:48:50.727
THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE. TO

00:48:50.794 --> 00:48:53.897
ENGAGE IN AN ADDITIONAL TAXATION

00:48:53.964 --> 00:48:56.300
PROCESS FOR A SUBSET OF THE

00:48:56.366 --> 00:49:00.904
POPULATION -- WHO -- ARE VICTIMS

00:49:00.971 --> 00:49:02.839
HAVE BEEN VICTIMIZED.

00:49:02.906 --> 00:49:05.409
BY GOVERNMENT SYSTEMS -- AND

00:49:05.475 --> 00:49:07.911
HAVE INDEED PAID THEIR DEBT IF

00:49:07.978 --> 00:49:11.248
YOU WILL THROUGH INCARCERATION

00:49:11.315 --> 00:49:13.250
WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE -- HOW

00:49:13.317 --> 00:49:15.018
WE PAY FOR IT IS A SEPARATE

00:49:15.085 --> 00:49:16.787
CONVERSATION AND I BELIEVE

00:49:16.853 --> 00:49:18.355
GOVERNMENT SHOULD STEP UP AND

00:49:18.422 --> 00:49:20.724
ENGAGE IN PROVIDING THE SERVICES

00:49:20.791 --> 00:49:22.259
THAT WE DEEM APPROPRIATE --

00:49:22.326 --> 00:49:23.960
WHETHER OR NOT THEY SHOULD BE ON

00:49:24.027 --> 00:49:25.729
THE BACKS OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE

00:49:25.796 --> 00:49:26.496
TOUCHED BY THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE

00:49:26.563 --> 00:49:29.232
SYSTEM THAT IS WHERE I HAPPEN TO

00:49:29.299 --> 00:49:30.233
DISAGREE.

00:49:30.300 --> 00:49:31.768
WELL I AND I AND I APPRECIATE

00:49:31.835 --> 00:49:35.405
THAT PHILOSOPHICAL DISTINCTION --

00:49:35.472 --> 00:49:37.708
I I HAVE A MY ASK IS VERY

00:49:37.774 --> 00:49:39.509
SPECIFIC TO THE PROGRAMS DEALING

00:49:39.576 --> 00:49:41.044
WITH DOMESTIC VIOLENCE BECAUSE

00:49:41.111 --> 00:49:42.512
LIKE YOURSELF THIS IS BEEN AN

00:49:42.579 --> 00:49:44.715
AREA I HAVE.

00:49:44.781 --> 00:49:47.117
BEEN CLAWING AT FOR A LONG TIME

00:49:47.184 --> 00:49:48.719
BEFORE WE EVEN RECOGNIZE

00:49:48.785 --> 00:49:50.687
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS A CRIME OF

00:49:50.754 --> 00:49:51.521
COURSE [inaudible]

00:49:51.588 --> 00:49:54.191
AND RECOGNIZING THAT IN MANY

00:49:54.257 --> 00:49:55.258
INSTANCES WE HAVE THESE

00:49:55.325 --> 00:49:57.461
DIVERSION PROGRAM SO THAT THE

00:49:57.527 --> 00:50:00.330
THAT THE COST THAT PEOPLE PAY IS

00:50:00.397 --> 00:50:02.899
NOT NECESSARILY INCARCERATION

00:50:02.966 --> 00:50:03.166
THE GOAL.

00:50:03.233 --> 00:50:04.601
IS NOT.

00:50:04.668 --> 00:50:06.236
THIS IS NOT A DETERRENT THIS

00:50:06.303 --> 00:50:08.171
SITUATION DOMESTIC VIOLENCE THIS

00:50:08.238 --> 00:50:10.974
IS PAYMENT FOR A PROGRAM THAT IS

00:50:11.041 --> 00:50:12.642
HOPEFULLY GOING TO CHANGE THAT

00:50:12.709 --> 00:50:13.977
BEHAVIOR.

00:50:14.044 --> 00:50:16.313
AND ALSO TO PROTECT LOVED ONES

00:50:16.380 --> 00:50:17.714
FROM CONTINUED ABUSE.

00:50:17.781 --> 00:50:19.282
SO.

00:50:19.349 --> 00:50:22.018
THE ACTUAL COST TO YOU HAVE TO

00:50:22.085 --> 00:50:23.420
PAY FOR THIS AND YOU HAVE TO

00:50:23.487 --> 00:50:25.822
ATTEND LET'S SAY FIFTY TWO WEEKS

00:50:25.889 --> 00:50:27.457
ONCE A WEEK FOR TWO OR THREE

00:50:27.524 --> 00:50:29.593
HOURS. TO ADDRESS WHATEVER THOSE

00:50:29.659 --> 00:50:32.963
PROBLEMS ARE THAT CAUSE YOU TO

00:50:33.029 --> 00:50:34.197

OSTENSIBLY LOVE. TO ME IS NOT AN

00:50:36.666 --> 00:50:39.836
OUTRAGEOUS COSTED TO ITS.

00:50:39.903 --> 00:50:41.304
IT'S SOMETHING THAT HE COULD IT

00:50:41.371 --> 00:50:42.639
ALLOWS FOR THE SYSTEM TO

00:50:42.706 --> 00:50:44.241
CONTINUE SO THAT WE CAN TRY TO

00:50:44.307 --> 00:50:46.076
IMPROVE AND REDUCE THIS KIND OF

00:50:46.143 --> 00:50:47.010
BEHAVIOR.

00:50:47.077 --> 00:50:50.046
AND IN MOST INSTANCES THERE'S NO

00:50:50.113 --> 00:50:51.815
CONCOMITANT.

00:50:51.882 --> 00:50:54.317
PUNISHMENT THE OF INCARCERATION

00:50:54.384 --> 00:50:56.920
SO IF YOU WOULD I I RECOGNIZE

00:50:56.987 --> 00:50:58.955
FEES AND COSTS AND ADD ONS AND

00:50:59.022 --> 00:50:59.856
SO FORTH AND I COULDN'T AGREE

00:50:59.923 --> 00:51:02.192
WITH YOU MORE BUT I AS I LOOK AT

00:51:02.259 --> 00:51:04.861
THIS VERY SPECIFIC PROGRAM

00:51:04.928 --> 00:51:05.429
BECAUSE IT'S ONE THAT I HAVE

00:51:05.495 --> 00:51:06.396
BEEN.

00:51:06.463 --> 00:51:08.999
SUPPORT OF BOB AND FOLLOWED AND

00:51:09.065 --> 00:51:11.835
HELP TO ADVANCE -- MY FEAR IS

00:51:11.902 --> 00:51:12.903
THAT.

00:51:12.969 --> 00:51:13.570
WE ARE GOING TO SEE THESE

00:51:13.637 --> 00:51:15.639
PROGRAMS ENDING BECAUSE THE

00:51:15.705 --> 00:51:17.040
ARGUMENT IS GOING TO BE THERE

00:51:17.107 --> 00:51:18.842
ISN'T MONEY THERE BECAUSE THE

00:51:18.909 --> 00:51:20.444
PEOPLE WHO.

00:51:20.510 --> 00:51:21.978
HAVE CREATED A NEED FOR THIS

00:51:22.045 --> 00:51:23.713
PROGRAM ARE NOT GOING TO BE

00:51:23.780 --> 00:51:26.216
CALLED TO TO SUPPORTED AND TO

00:51:26.283 --> 00:51:28.285
FUNDED -- I HEAR YOU LOUD AND

00:51:28.351 --> 00:51:30.020
CLEAR AND I WOULD PUSH BACK A

00:51:30.086 --> 00:51:31.922
LITTLE IN AND I THINK A ADD TO

00:51:31.988 --> 00:51:33.356
YOUR QUESTION BY SUGGEST WHAT

00:51:33.423 --> 00:51:35.425
HAPPENS TO THOSE WHO ARE IN A

00:51:35.492 --> 00:51:36.993
POSITION. TO PAY THE FEE DO THEY

00:51:37.060 --> 00:51:38.795
THE NOT BENEFIT FROM THAT

00:51:38.862 --> 00:51:40.397
PROGRAM THAT AND SO WE CAN

00:51:40.464 --> 00:51:43.099
CONTINUE TO CREATE A SYSTEM IN

00:51:43.166 --> 00:51:44.835
WHICH LIKE WE JUST HAD.

00:51:44.901 --> 00:51:45.602
LOTS OF DISCUSSIONS IN THIS

00:51:45.669 --> 00:51:47.103
COMMITTEE AROUND THE BILL SYSTEM

00:51:47.170 --> 00:51:48.138
WE CONTINUE TO CREATE A SYSTEM

00:51:48.205 --> 00:51:51.208
IN WHICH THOSE WHO CAN AFFORD IT.

00:51:51.274 --> 00:51:53.443
GET A DIFFERENT -- KIND OF

00:51:53.510 --> 00:51:54.978
JUSTICE COMPARED TO THOSE WHO

00:51:55.045 --> 00:51:55.979
CAN'T.

00:51:56.046 --> 00:51:57.314
AND SO I WOULD HOPE THAT WE

00:51:57.380 --> 00:51:58.949
WOULD HAVE A SYSTEM IN WHICH

00:51:59.015 --> 00:52:00.183
EVERYONE WHO.

00:52:00.250 --> 00:52:02.686
A JUDGE OR WHOEVER FEELS COULD

00:52:02.752 --> 00:52:04.588
BENEFIT AND MAY HOLE BY WHATEVER

00:52:04.654 --> 00:52:09.993
THE DETERRENT IS A DV ANGER

00:52:10.060 --> 00:52:10.594
MANAGEMENT CLASS WHATEVER THE

00:52:10.660 --> 00:52:12.562
CASE IS SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO IT

00:52:12.629 --> 00:52:14.197
AND SO WE MUST HAVE A SYSTEM

00:52:14.264 --> 00:52:15.765
THAT WHETHER YOU CAN PAY.

00:52:15.832 --> 00:52:18.502
AND I CAN'T SHOULD MATTER IF OUR

00:52:18.568 --> 00:52:20.570
ULTIMATE GOAL IS TO CREATE YOU

00:52:20.637 --> 00:52:23.640
KNOW A EIGHT CALIFORNIA WHERE A

00:52:23.707 --> 00:52:24.908
DV IS NO MORE.

00:52:24.975 --> 00:52:26.643
SO IF I MAY HAVE ONE MORE

00:52:26.710 --> 00:52:29.613
QUESTION TO FOLLOW UP ON THIS SO.

00:52:29.679 --> 00:52:30.914
UNDER THIS BILL WOULD THERE

00:52:30.981 --> 00:52:32.782
STILL BE AND FREQUENTLY THE

00:52:32.849 --> 00:52:35.018
COURTS HAVE A SLIDING SCALES

00:52:35.085 --> 00:52:37.254
BASED UPON WHAT PEOPLE CAN AND

00:52:37.320 --> 00:52:38.321
CANNOT AFFORD.

00:52:38.388 --> 00:52:40.624
WE PROVIDE JUSTICE TO PEOPLE WHO

00:52:40.690 --> 00:52:42.058
CANNOT AFFORD.

00:52:42.125 --> 00:52:43.660
THEIR OWN INDEPENDENT COUNSEL WE

00:52:43.727 --> 00:52:45.529
PROVIDE THE PUBLIC DEFENDER

00:52:45.595 --> 00:52:50.100
ALTERNATE ALTERNATE COUNCIL --

00:52:50.166 --> 00:52:51.935
WOULD THAT BE -- IT WOULD THAT

00:52:52.002 --> 00:52:53.470
CONTINUE UNDER THIS PROGRAM SO

00:52:53.537 --> 00:52:54.871
IF SOMEONE IS INDIGENT AS YOU

00:52:54.938 --> 00:52:56.139
ARE I CANNOT AFFORD TO PAY FOR

00:52:56.206 --> 00:52:56.473
THIS.

00:52:56.540 --> 00:52:58.008
WE'RE NOT GOING TO ESSENTIALLY

00:52:58.074 --> 00:52:59.409
SO WITH THEN YOU CAN'T QUALIFY

00:52:59.476 --> 00:53:01.845
BUT HAVE A SLIDING SCALE SO THAT

00:53:01.912 --> 00:53:04.014
PEOPLE PAY WHAT THEY'RE ABLE TO

00:53:04.080 --> 00:53:05.749
AND IF THEY'RE NOT WE STILL WANT

00:53:05.815 --> 00:53:07.150
TO GET THAN ANGER MANAGEMENT.

00:53:07.217 --> 00:53:09.085
BUT AT LEAST THOSE WHO CAN

00:53:09.152 --> 00:53:11.555
AFFORD IT -- OR IF AFFORD SOME

00:53:11.621 --> 00:53:14.558
PERCENTAGE OF THAT STILL BE --

00:53:14.624 --> 00:53:19.996
EXPECTED TO TO TO DO THAT UNDER

00:53:20.063 --> 00:53:22.866
THIS DEAL.

00:53:22.933 --> 00:53:25.468
ALL SIDES AND AND THAT'S

00:53:25.535 --> 00:53:27.470
BASICALLY RESEARCH THAT WHILE

00:53:27.537 --> 00:53:29.839
KIND OF THIS THEORY AND MAYBE IN

00:53:29.906 --> 00:53:31.575
THE IN THE CASE OF CAPTAIN YORK

00:53:31.641 --> 00:53:32.409
COUNTY ARE WITH REGARD.

00:53:32.475 --> 00:53:33.276
TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND ANGER

00:53:33.343 --> 00:53:35.145
MANAGEMENT TRAINING YOU KNOW THE

00:53:35.211 --> 00:53:37.981
THE RESEARCH SHOWS THAT IT THAT

00:53:38.048 --> 00:53:40.150
IT IS NOT PEOPLE OF ME.

00:53:40.216 --> 00:53:42.185
THAT ARE TOUCHED BY THE SYSTEM.

00:53:42.252 --> 00:53:43.887
OFF IN LARGE PART IT IS NOT AND

00:53:43.954 --> 00:53:45.255
TRAGICALLY EVEN THOUGH CURRENT

00:53:45.322 --> 00:53:45.889
COLD CREATES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR

00:53:45.956 --> 00:53:46.923
THOSE WHO CAN AFFORD IT TO NOT

00:53:46.990 --> 00:53:47.657
BE CHARGED.

00:53:47.724 --> 00:53:48.625
THAT IS FLAWED AND THAT DOESN'T

00:53:48.692 --> 00:53:49.225
SEEM TO BE THE CASE COUNTIES

00:53:49.292 --> 00:53:50.694
CONTINUE TO PUSH FORWARD IN

00:53:50.760 --> 00:53:52.996
CHARGE IN THE CASE OF SB ONE

00:53:53.063 --> 00:53:53.763
NINETY WE HAD.

00:53:53.830 --> 00:53:57.601
AMAZING RESEARCH THAT SHOWED --

00:53:57.667 --> 00:53:59.436
THE NUMBER OF COUNTIES THAT

00:53:59.502 --> 00:54:01.705
IGNORED THE INDIGENT KIND OF OPT

00:54:01.771 --> 00:54:03.206
OUT FOR THESE PROGRAMS AND THAT

00:54:03.273 --> 00:54:04.741
CONTINUES TO BE THE CASE ACROSS

00:54:04.808 --> 00:54:06.142
THE STATE SO THAT CURRENT

00:54:06.209 --> 00:54:08.345
PROTECTION IN LAW IS A

00:54:08.411 --> 00:54:08.979
PROTECTING THOSE WHO CAN AFFORD

00:54:09.045 --> 00:54:09.846
IT.

00:54:09.913 --> 00:54:11.448
IT'S JUST NOT.

00:54:11.514 --> 00:54:13.049
WELL I APPRECIATE THAT I DO.

00:54:13.116 --> 00:54:14.884
HI I'M KINDA TORN I HEAR WHAT

00:54:14.951 --> 00:54:16.553
YOU'RE SAYING BUT I BUT I ALSO

00:54:16.620 --> 00:54:17.988
DON'T WANT.

00:54:18.054 --> 00:54:19.322
TO I DON'T WANT TO SEE PROGRAMS

00:54:19.389 --> 00:54:20.790
LIKE THIS DISAPPEAR BECAUSE

00:54:20.857 --> 00:54:21.958
ARGUABLY THERE'S NOT ENOUGH

00:54:22.025 --> 00:54:24.227
FUNDING FOR IT I UNDERSTAND THAT

00:54:24.294 --> 00:54:26.162
AND AND WHAT WELL THERE'S

00:54:26.229 --> 00:54:27.364
CERTAINLY NO GUARANTEES I THINK

00:54:27.430 --> 00:54:28.298
THE WORK.

00:54:28.365 --> 00:54:30.200
THAT YOU AND OTHERS HAVE PUT IN

00:54:30.266 --> 00:54:32.902
PLACE FOR YEARS AROUND MAKING

00:54:32.969 --> 00:54:36.539
THOSE KINDS OF PROGRAMS ARE NORM --

00:54:36.606 --> 00:54:38.408
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE TO ATTEST

00:54:38.475 --> 00:54:39.976
THAT THOSE KINDS OF THE VERSION

00:54:40.043 --> 00:54:42.312
PROGRAMS ARE COST SAVINGS IN THE

00:54:42.379 --> 00:54:44.614
LONG RUN BECAUSE TO TO SAVE IN

00:54:44.681 --> 00:54:49.619
TERMS OF INCARCERATION THAT

00:54:49.686 --> 00:54:51.888
DOUBT THOSE DOLLARS AND SENSE

00:54:51.955 --> 00:54:52.188
MAKES SENSE.

00:54:52.255 --> 00:54:53.156
ALL AND I WOULD.

00:54:53.223 --> 00:54:54.958
REFER YOU BACK AGAIN TO THE

00:54:55.025 --> 00:54:56.793
EXAMPLES I GAVE IN MY OPENING

00:54:56.860 --> 00:54:58.094
THAT THERE ARE TWO COUNTY

00:54:58.161 --> 00:54:59.529
SERVICES ONE ALAMEDA.

00:54:59.596 --> 00:55:02.732
WHO WILL LIMIT THE FEES WHO --

00:55:02.799 --> 00:55:04.367
IN THE AREAS OF THE VERSION --

00:55:04.434 --> 00:55:05.568
PROGRAMS ARE CONTINUING TO

00:55:05.635 --> 00:55:07.570
PROVIDE THOSE SERVICES I BELIEVE

00:55:07.637 --> 00:55:09.205
BECAUSE THEY KNOW THEY'RE COST

00:55:09.272 --> 00:55:10.040
EFFECTIVE [inaudible]

00:55:10.106 --> 00:55:12.142
AND AGAIN.

00:55:12.208 --> 00:55:15.745
WE CANNOT FIND COUNTIES WHO --

00:56:44.467 --> 00:56:46.903
USING THOSE EXAMPLES OF COUNTIES.

00:56:46.970 --> 00:56:48.404
A LARGE COUNTY LA COUNTY IS

00:56:48.471 --> 00:56:49.906

WERE TOUCHED BY THE SYTEM.

00:57:32.582 --> 00:57:34.984
IT IS VERY DIFFICULT -- WILL WE

00:57:35.051 --> 00:57:37.086

AROUND THE THE TRUE VALUE OF

00:57:57.674 --> 00:58:01.344
IT'S APPROPRIATE STATEWIDE

00:58:01.411 --> 00:58:03.646

WHERE YOU GET THESE FEES I THINK

00:58:19.028 --> 00:58:20.230
THE CHALLENGE WITH THE WHOLE

00:58:20.296 --> 00:58:22.565
SLIDING SCALE CONCEPT IS OUR

00:58:22.632 --> 00:58:24.434

COUNTIES A BILLING A ABILITY AND

00:58:37.146 --> 00:58:41.217

JUSTICE SYSTEM BY.

00:59:26.029 --> 00:59:29.065
IT IS A A SYMPTOM OF OUR FAILURE

00:59:29.132 --> 00:59:31.734
TO HAVE -- ADEQUATE PROGRESSIVE

00:59:31.801 --> 00:59:34.771

GOVERNMENT SERVICES THAT SHOULD

BE FUNDED THROUGH TAXES AND THEN

00:59:43.479 --> 00:59:45.148
THAT ENDS UP FALLING ON LOW

00:59:45.214 --> 00:59:46.549
INCOME PEOPLE SO.

00:59:46.616 --> 00:59:48.251
I THIS IS A GOOD START. ONE

00:59:48.318 --> 00:59:49.719
QUESTION THOUGH IN TERMS OF THE

00:59:49.786 --> 00:59:52.021
CONCERN WAS RAISED ABOUT THE

00:59:52.088 --> 00:59:53.656
IGNITION INTERLOCK DEVICE WHICH

00:59:53.723 --> 00:59:55.525
OF COURSE WE HAD A BILL WHAT TWO

00:59:55.591 --> 00:59:57.026
WEEKS AGO CENTER OURSELVES --

00:59:57.093 --> 00:59:58.194
BILL WHICH WE ARE WHICH I

00:59:58.261 --> 00:59:59.562

01:00:01.431 --> 01:00:02.899
COMMENT ON THAT BECAUSE I THINK

01:00:02.966 --> 01:00:05.902
THAT IS -- IMPORT IN AND OF

01:00:05.969 --> 01:00:07.603
COURSE WE DON'T WE WANT TO MAKE

01:00:07.670 --> 01:00:09.038

01:00:11.607 --> 01:00:12.608
THE OPPOSITE THAT.

01:00:12.675 --> 01:00:13.977
STATED THAT WE'RE IN

01:00:14.043 --> 01:00:15.511
CONVERSATIONS WILL CONTINUE AT

01:00:15.578 --> 01:00:16.813
THIS POINT WE HAVE A COMPANY

01:00:16.879 --> 01:00:18.147
AGREEMENT BUT BUT WE HAVE OPEN

01:00:18.214 --> 01:00:19.315
DOOR POLICY WE CONTINUE TO TALK

01:00:19.382 --> 01:00:20.984
ABOUT IT THANK YOU IT IS NOT OUR

01:00:21.050 --> 01:00:25.121
GOAL -- TO CREATE A NEW SYSTEM

01:00:25.188 --> 01:00:26.356
THAT IS EQUALLY AS FAR AS THE

01:00:26.422 --> 01:00:32.195
CURRENT ONE AND WILL CONTINUE TO

01:00:32.261 --> 01:00:34.130
WORK THROUGH IT.

01:00:34.197 --> 01:00:35.398
ARE WE HAVE A MOTION.

01:00:35.465 --> 01:00:36.866
IN THE LAST COMMENT I WANT TO

01:00:36.933 --> 01:00:38.201
MAKE IT SOUND.

01:00:38.267 --> 01:00:38.968
THERE WAS REFERENCE SOMEWHAT BUT

01:00:39.035 --> 01:00:40.703
NOT ALL OF THESE -- FINDS OUR

01:00:40.770 --> 01:00:43.473
FEES ARE -- CAN AFFECT SOLD TO A

01:00:43.539 --> 01:00:44.907
COLLECTION AGENCY BUT VERY

01:00:44.974 --> 01:00:46.242
COMMONLY WHAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

01:00:46.309 --> 01:00:47.377
DO NOW.

01:00:47.443 --> 01:00:49.879
IS IN EFFECT TURN OVER THE

01:00:49.946 --> 01:00:50.546
COLLECTION.

01:00:50.613 --> 01:00:55.284
AND WHEN -- JUST. FOR EXAMPLE

01:00:55.351 --> 01:00:57.253
THIS IS MORE AROUND AND PARKING

01:00:57.320 --> 01:00:58.955
AND TRAFFIC FINES.

01:00:59.022 --> 01:01:01.457
BACK IN THE EIGHTIES WHEN I WAS

01:01:01.524 --> 01:01:03.893
ON THE BERKELEY CITY COUNCIL.

01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:06.896
AND WE ASKED FOR AN AUDIT OF

01:01:06.963 --> 01:01:10.066
WHAT WE WERE ACTUALLY RECOVERING

01:01:10.133 --> 01:01:12.201
FROM OUR FINES AND FEES WE FOUND

01:01:12.268 --> 01:01:14.670
THAT WE WERE RECOVERING VERY LOW

01:01:14.737 --> 01:01:16.639
BECAUSE OF OUR USE OF THESE

01:01:16.706 --> 01:01:18.174
COLLECTION AGENCIES.

01:01:18.241 --> 01:01:20.043
AND WHEN WE DID PARKING TICKET

01:01:20.109 --> 01:01:23.613
AMNESTY WE COLLECTED MORE MONEY.

01:01:23.679 --> 01:01:26.482
THAN WE MEANING JUST BASICALLY

01:01:26.549 --> 01:01:28.184
BRING BRING IT DOWN TO THE

01:01:28.251 --> 01:01:29.552
BOTTOM LEVEL FEE WITH NO FOR NO

01:01:29.619 --> 01:01:31.487
PENALTY WE'VE COLLECTED MORE

01:01:31.554 --> 01:01:33.022
MONEY.

01:01:33.089 --> 01:01:34.891
THAN WE COLLECTED WITH THE OTHER

01:01:34.957 --> 01:01:37.026
SYSTEM SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

01:01:37.093 --> 01:01:38.995
ALSO TO NOTE THAT THE LOCAL

01:01:39.062 --> 01:01:40.997
GOVERNMENTS THEMSELVES IN A AND

01:01:41.064 --> 01:01:41.898
I THINK THIS IS BEEN REFERENCE

01:01:41.964 --> 01:01:44.400
IN THIS NOT THE CASE IN EVERYONE

01:01:44.467 --> 01:01:45.334
OF THESE CATEGORIES BUT IN MANY

01:01:45.401 --> 01:01:46.069
OF THEM.

01:01:46.135 --> 01:01:48.104
THEY REALLY -- THEMSELVES ARE

01:01:48.171 --> 01:01:51.541
NOT RECOVERING THIS REVENUE SO --

01:01:51.607 --> 01:01:53.876
ANYWAY MIDDLE MAN YES ONE MORE

01:01:53.943 --> 01:01:55.144
QUESTION -- I ACTUALLY GO AHEAD.

01:01:55.211 --> 01:01:59.382
I WONDER SENATOR -- IF YOU WOULD

01:01:59.449 --> 01:02:00.750
BE WILLING -- TO KEEP IN MIND

01:02:00.817 --> 01:02:03.219
THIS ISSUE OF THESE PROGRAMS ON

01:02:03.286 --> 01:02:04.987
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE THE VERSION.

01:02:05.054 --> 01:02:08.224
SO THAT IF IT IS THAT WE CAN.

01:08:57.399 --> 01:08:58.601
VOTE ONE OF THE MOST VULNERABLE

01:08:58.667 --> 01:09:00.402
SEGMENTS OF OUR SOCIETY.

01:09:00.469 --> 01:09:02.738
THE ELDERLY AND THE DEPENDENT

01:09:02.805 --> 01:09:04.640
ADULTS IN OUR COMMUNITIES.

01:09:04.707 --> 01:09:06.709
ALL TOO OFTEN I SEE ELDER

01:09:06.775 --> 01:09:08.344
INDEPENDENT ADULTS WHO ARE

01:09:08.410 --> 01:09:09.578
SPECIFICALLY TARGETED.

01:09:09.645 --> 01:09:11.647
BECAUSE OF THEIR AGE OR BECAUSE

01:09:11.714 --> 01:09:13.449
OF THEIR DISABILITY.

01:09:13.516 --> 01:09:15.050
THESE PERPETRATORS SELECT THEM

01:09:15.117 --> 01:09:16.585
BECAUSE OF THOSE VERY

01:09:16.652 --> 01:09:18.287
VULNERABILITIES.

01:09:18.354 --> 01:09:20.055
BECAUSE OF THEIR AGE THEIR

01:09:20.122 --> 01:09:21.423
FRAILTY.

01:09:21.490 --> 01:09:22.992
THEIR POOR MEMORIES THEIR

01:09:23.058 --> 01:09:25.261
LIKELIHOOD OF GETTING CONFUSED.

01:09:25.327 --> 01:09:26.862
THEIR DEFICITS AND DETECTING

01:09:26.929 --> 01:09:28.497
DECEPTION.

01:09:28.564 --> 01:09:31.467
AND PERHAPS MOST TRAGICALLY.

01:09:31.534 --> 01:09:33.269
THESE INDIVIDUALS DESIRES TO

01:09:33.335 --> 01:09:35.538
STILL BE OF USE TO THEIR LOVED

01:09:35.604 --> 01:09:37.006
ONES INTO THE COMMUNITY AND THE

01:09:37.072 --> 01:09:39.542
LONELINESS OF THE OFTEN FEEL.

01:09:39.608 --> 01:09:41.043
AS THEY REACH THE END OF THEIR

01:09:41.110 --> 01:09:43.012
LIVES.

01:09:43.078 --> 01:09:45.414
WITH THE EVER INCREASING ELDERLY

01:09:45.481 --> 01:09:46.982
POPULATION IN CALIFORNIA.

01:09:47.049 --> 01:09:48.517
THESE CRIMES IN PARTICULAR

01:09:48.584 --> 01:09:49.785
FINANCIAL CRIMES ARE MORE AND

01:09:49.852 --> 01:09:51.387
MORE COMMON.

01:09:51.453 --> 01:09:52.922
BECAUSE NOT ONLY ARE OLDER

01:09:52.988 --> 01:09:54.490
INDEPENDENT ADULTS EXTREMELY

01:09:54.557 --> 01:09:57.359
VULNERABLE BUT UNLIKE OTHER

01:09:57.426 --> 01:09:57.893
VULNERABLE GROUPS SUCH AS

01:09:57.960 --> 01:09:59.628
CHILDREN.

01:09:59.695 --> 01:10:01.263
ELDERS INDEPENDENT ADULTS HAVE

01:10:01.330 --> 01:10:03.666
MONEY THEY HAVE ASSETS THEY HAVE

01:10:03.732 --> 01:10:04.833
PENSIONS.

01:10:04.900 --> 01:10:07.870
THEY HAVE SAVINGS ACCOUNTS OFTEN

01:10:07.937 --> 01:10:09.038
THEY OWN HOMES OR OTHER

01:10:09.104 --> 01:10:10.306
PROPERTIES.

01:10:10.372 --> 01:10:12.041
AND THAT MAKES THEM IN THE EYES

01:10:12.107 --> 01:10:14.476
OF THESE WOULD BE ABUSERS THE

01:10:14.543 --> 01:10:16.912
PERFECT VICTIMS.

01:10:16.979 --> 01:10:18.247
SB THREE OR FOUR WILL PROVIDE

01:10:18.314 --> 01:10:20.416
ADDITIONAL PROTECTIONS TO THOSE

01:10:20.482 --> 01:10:22.151
VICTIMS BY PERMITTING OF THOSE

01:10:22.217 --> 01:10:23.819
WHO COMMIT FINANCIAL ABUSE IN

01:10:23.886 --> 01:10:26.088
MULTIPLE JURISDICTIONS. TO BE

01:10:26.155 --> 01:10:27.690
TRIED IN A SINGLE COUNTY.

01:10:27.756 --> 01:10:29.024
NOT ONLY WILL THIS IMPROVE

01:10:29.091 --> 01:10:31.226
JUDICIAL ECONOMY IT WILL PREVENT

01:10:31.293 --> 01:10:32.595
VICTIMS FROM HAVING TO BE

01:10:32.661 --> 01:10:33.429
INVOLVED IN MULTIPLE

01:10:33.495 --> 01:10:35.397
PROSECUTIONS WHICH OFTEN

01:10:35.464 --> 01:10:36.765
INVOLVES TESTIFYING IN MULTIPLE

01:10:36.832 --> 01:10:38.267
HEARINGS.

01:10:38.334 --> 01:10:39.535
TRAVELLING TO MULTIPLE COURT

01:10:39.602 --> 01:10:42.404
ROOMS AND CAN BE VERY STRESSFUL

01:10:42.471 --> 01:10:44.173
AND DIFFICULT FOR OLDER

01:10:44.239 --> 01:10:45.774
INDEPENDENT ADULTS.

01:10:45.841 --> 01:10:47.142
THE LEGISLATURE HAS ALREADY

01:10:47.209 --> 01:10:49.111
AFFORD THESE PROTECTIONS TO

01:10:49.178 --> 01:10:50.779
OTHER VULNERABLE VICTIM GROUPS.

01:10:50.846 --> 01:10:52.681
CHILDREN VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC

01:10:52.748 --> 01:10:55.351
VIOLENCE VICTIMS OF STALKING A

01:10:55.417 --> 01:10:57.286
SEXUAL ASSAULT.

01:10:57.353 --> 01:10:59.588
AN OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING.

01:10:59.655 --> 01:11:01.757
WITH THE PASSAGE OF SB THREE OR

01:11:01.824 --> 01:11:03.058
FOUR ELDER INDEPENDENT ADULTS

01:11:03.125 --> 01:11:05.027
WILL BE INCLUDED AND THEY WILL

01:11:05.094 --> 01:11:06.962
GET TO THE EQUAL PROTECTION THAT

01:11:07.029 --> 01:11:08.364
THEY SOLD.

01:11:08.430 --> 01:11:09.598
VERY MUCH DESERVED UNDER THIS

01:11:09.665 --> 01:11:11.700
LAW.

01:11:11.767 --> 01:11:12.968
YOU MAY BE THINKING OF FINANCIAL

01:11:13.035 --> 01:11:14.737
CRIMES AGAINST OLDER INDEPENDENT

01:11:14.803 --> 01:11:16.405
ADULTS ARE DIFFERENT CLASS OF

01:11:16.472 --> 01:11:17.406
CRIMES.

01:11:17.473 --> 01:11:19.008
BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT CRIMES OF

01:11:19.074 --> 01:11:20.509
VIOLENCE AND THEREFORE LESS

01:11:20.576 --> 01:11:22.444
SERIOUS AND LESS IMPACTFUL ON

01:11:22.511 --> 01:11:23.579
THE VICTIMS.

01:11:23.646 --> 01:11:25.414
BUT I CAN TELL YOU FROM SEEING

01:11:25.481 --> 01:11:27.383
AND HEARING AND SPEAKING TO

01:11:27.449 --> 01:11:29.918
THESE VICTIMS THAT THAT COULD

01:11:29.985 --> 01:11:32.021
NOT BE FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH.

01:11:32.087 --> 01:11:34.156
I HAVE MET WITH A WORLD WAR TWO

01:11:34.223 --> 01:11:36.425
VETERAN WHO IS A VERY PROUD SELF

01:11:36.492 --> 01:11:37.893
SUFFICIENT MEMBER.

01:11:37.960 --> 01:11:39.194
OF THE GREATEST GENERATION AND

01:11:39.261 --> 01:11:40.462
I'VE SEEN HIM BREAK DOWN IN

01:11:40.529 --> 01:11:42.331
TEARS DESCRIBING HOW HE WAS

01:11:42.398 --> 01:11:44.033
SWINDLED OUT OF MONEY.

01:11:44.099 --> 01:11:45.601
AND HOW HE WAS GOING TO TELL HIS

01:11:45.668 --> 01:11:46.669
FAMILY.

01:11:46.735 --> 01:11:49.138
WHO REVERE HIM AND LOVE HIM?

01:11:49.204 --> 01:11:52.608
THAT HE FELL FOR SUCH A SCHEME.

01:11:52.675 --> 01:11:54.076
I'VE SEEN A SEVENTY FIVE YEAR

01:11:54.143 --> 01:11:55.678
OLD IMMIGRANT FROM MEXICO LOSE

01:11:55.744 --> 01:11:57.246
THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS.

01:11:57.312 --> 01:11:58.881
AND WHAT HE BELIEVED WAS AN

01:11:58.947 --> 01:12:00.482
ATTEMPT TO HELP ANOTHER LESS

01:12:00.549 --> 01:12:02.117
FORTUNATE IMMIGRANT.

01:12:02.184 --> 01:12:03.819
AND AS A RESULT OF THAT LOSS HE

01:12:03.886 --> 01:12:05.554
HAD TO DECIDE FOR SEVERAL MONTHS

01:12:05.621 --> 01:12:06.922
WHETHER TO EAT THREE SQUARE

01:12:06.989 --> 01:12:09.024
MEALS A DAY OR TO PAY FOR HIS

01:12:09.091 --> 01:12:10.893
MEDICATION.

01:12:10.959 --> 01:12:12.728
I'VE SEEN A WIDOW WHOSE WEDDING

01:12:12.795 --> 01:12:13.996
RING WAS POND.

01:12:14.063 --> 01:12:15.497
BY SOMEONE THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO

01:12:15.564 --> 01:12:16.865
BE HERE CARE TAKER.

01:12:16.932 --> 01:12:18.434
THAT WEDDING RING WAS LOST

01:12:18.500 --> 01:12:19.501
BECAUSE IT WAS MELTED DOWN FOR

01:12:19.568 --> 01:12:21.270
GOLD AND THAT WOMAN WILL NEVER

01:12:21.336 --> 01:12:22.771
GET THAT VALUABLE.

01:12:22.838 --> 01:12:24.173
PROBABLY THE MOST VALUABLE ITEM

01:12:24.239 --> 01:12:26.075
SHE OWNS BACK AGAIN.

01:12:26.141 --> 01:12:27.776
AND I'VE SEEN DEPENDENT ADULTS

01:12:27.843 --> 01:12:29.812
WHO WHOSE PARENTS BEFORE THEY

01:12:29.878 --> 01:12:31.547
DIED SET THEM UP TO HAVE A

01:12:31.613 --> 01:12:32.648
SECURE.

01:12:32.715 --> 01:12:34.349
HOME BECAUSE THEY COULD NO

01:12:34.416 --> 01:12:35.551
LONGER WORK.

01:12:35.617 --> 01:12:36.885
AND TO SEE THOSE PEOPLE BE

01:12:36.952 --> 01:12:38.487
SWINDLED OUT OF THEIR MONEY AND

01:12:38.554 --> 01:12:39.788
FORCED TO LIVE.

01:12:39.855 --> 01:12:42.091
IN CRAMPED CARE HOMES WHEN THEIR

01:12:42.157 --> 01:12:44.293
FAMILIES THAT AFFORDED. FOR THEM.

01:12:44.359 --> 01:12:47.396
A BETTER LIFE.

01:12:47.463 --> 01:12:48.697
AND THE PROBLEM WITH ELDERLY

01:12:48.764 --> 01:12:51.433
INDEPENDENT VICTIMS IS THAT MOST

01:12:51.500 --> 01:12:53.102
FREQUENTLY THEY CANNOT WORK.

01:12:53.168 --> 01:12:55.504
THEY CANNOT MAKE THAT MONEY BACK

01:12:55.571 --> 01:12:57.773
SO ONCE IT IS GONE IT'S GONE.

01:12:57.840 --> 01:12:59.541
AND THEY WHO WORKED SO HARD FOR

01:12:59.608 --> 01:13:01.243
THEIR ENTIRE LIVES TO GIVE

01:13:01.310 --> 01:13:03.345
THEMSELVES PEACE AND SECURITY

01:13:03.412 --> 01:13:04.780

ELDERLY OR DEPENDENT ADULTS ARE

01:13:12.020 --> 01:13:14.289
VICTIMS ARE DEVASTATING.

01:13:14.356 --> 01:13:15.724
THEY MUST BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY AND

01:13:15.791 --> 01:13:17.359

HE LEFT BEHIND FIVE BOYS.

01:49:53.119 --> 01:49:54.587
WE'RE NOT HAVING TO GROW UP

01:49:54.654 --> 01:49:56.189
WITHOUT A FATHER.

01:49:56.256 --> 01:49:57.357
AND HAVING HIM THERE FOR THEIR

01:49:57.424 --> 01:49:59.859
BIRTHDAY FOR CHRISTMAS.

01:49:59.926 --> 01:50:01.628
WHEN THEY TURN EIGHTEEN WHEN

01:50:01.695 --> 01:50:11.638
THEY GRADUATE FROM HIGH SCHOOL?

01:50:11.705 --> 01:50:13.606
THIS IS HARD TO DO BECAUSE EVEN

01:50:13.673 --> 01:50:14.174
THOUGH IT'S GOING TO BE TEN

01:50:14.240 --> 01:50:17.310
YEARS.

01:50:17.377 --> 01:50:19.946
THIS IS MY SON THIS IS.

01:50:20.013 --> 01:50:21.614
THE CHILD THAT I CARRIED FOR

01:50:21.681 --> 01:50:22.248
NINE MONTHS BROUGHT INTO THIS

01:50:22.315 --> 01:50:23.950
WORLD AND THEN HAD TO PUT IN THE

01:50:24.017 --> 01:50:27.220
GROUND.

01:50:27.287 --> 01:50:28.855
HANNAH NOT HAVING OFFICERS HELD

01:50:28.922 --> 01:50:30.223
ACCOUNTABLE FOR THAT IS LIKE

01:50:30.290 --> 01:50:33.927
REALLY DIFFICULT.

01:50:33.994 --> 01:50:34.828
YOU KNOW MY SON WAS A FOOT LIKE

01:50:34.894 --> 01:50:36.563
I SAID A FATHER OF FIVE BOYS AND

01:50:36.629 --> 01:50:38.898
AND HE WAS JUST.

01:50:38.965 --> 01:50:40.066
OF ALL THE THINGS THAT HE DID IN

01:50:40.133 --> 01:50:41.634
LIFE THE BEST THING HE DID WAS

01:50:41.701 --> 01:50:43.470
JUST BEING SUCH A GREAT FATHER

01:50:43.536 --> 01:50:46.473
TO HIS FATHER TO HIS CHILDREN --

01:50:46.539 --> 01:50:48.575
WEEK SAID I DON'T THINK ANYBODY

01:50:48.641 --> 01:50:50.443
SHOULD HAVE TO DIE IN THE MANNER

01:50:50.510 --> 01:50:51.778
IN WHICH HE DID YOU KNOW.

01:50:51.845 --> 01:50:52.412
POLICE OFFICER SHOULD BE

01:50:52.479 --> 01:50:53.646
SHOOTING PEOPLE FOR NOT AN

01:50:53.713 --> 01:50:59.352
IMMINENT DANGER.

01:50:59.419 --> 01:51:00.587
THE CALIFORNIA LAW IT'S POLICE

01:51:00.653 --> 01:51:01.888
OFFICERS USE DEADLY FORCE AND

01:51:01.955 --> 01:51:03.723
KILL SOMEONE EVEN WHEN OFFICERS

01:51:03.790 --> 01:51:05.492
HAVE OTHER OPTIONS.

01:51:05.558 --> 01:51:06.726
THAT MEANS WELL MANY POLICE

01:51:06.793 --> 01:51:07.794
SHOOTINGS LIKE THE ONE THAT TOOK

01:51:07.861 --> 01:51:09.329
MY SON'S LIFE ARE LEGALLY

01:51:09.396 --> 01:51:10.263
JUSTIFIED.

01:51:10.330 --> 01:51:11.731
THEY MAY NOT ACTUALLY HAVE BEEN

01:51:11.798 --> 01:51:12.999
NECESSARY.

01:51:13.066 --> 01:51:14.667
SO LET THAT SINK IN.

01:51:14.734 --> 01:51:15.969
POLICE CAN SHOOT AND TAKE

01:51:16.036 --> 01:51:17.504
SOMEONE'S LIFE EVEN WHEN THEY

01:51:17.570 --> 01:51:19.239
DON'T HAVE.

01:51:19.305 --> 01:51:20.807
TO KNOWING THIS DEPENDS MY PAIN

01:51:20.874 --> 01:51:21.708
BUT IS ALSO STRENGTHENED MY

01:51:21.775 --> 01:51:27.514
RESOLVE. TO HAVE TO DO

01:51:27.580 --> 01:51:28.782
EVERYTHING IN MY POWER TO

01:51:28.848 --> 01:51:30.116
ADVOCATE FOR REFORMS THAT WILL

01:51:30.183 --> 01:51:31.351
HELP PREVENT MORE UNNECESSARY

01:51:31.418 --> 01:51:33.386
TRAGEDIES.

01:51:33.453 --> 01:51:36.423
AND UNFORTUNATELY SB.

01:51:36.489 --> 01:51:37.057
TWO THIRTY AS FAR AS THAT I'M

01:51:37.123 --> 01:51:38.925
CLOSING RIGHT NOW BECAUSE I

01:51:38.992 --> 01:51:39.526
HAVEN'T I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE

01:51:39.592 --> 01:51:40.627
AMENDMENTS.

01:51:40.693 --> 01:51:41.961
IT DOESN'T CHANGES BY THE

01:51:42.028 --> 01:51:43.763
KEEPING THE REASONABLE STANDARD

01:51:43.830 --> 01:51:45.432
INTACT SB TWO THIRTY WILL

01:51:45.498 --> 01:51:47.233
CONTINUE TO ALLOW OFFICERS TO

01:51:47.300 --> 01:51:49.002
KILL PEOPLE LIKE CAESAR.

01:51:49.069 --> 01:51:49.636
EVEN WHEN THERE IS NO IMMEDIATE

01:51:49.702 --> 01:51:50.804
THREAT.

01:51:50.870 --> 01:51:52.639
AND EVEN WHEN OFFICERS HAVE

01:51:52.705 --> 01:51:54.707
OTHER ALTERNATIVES.

01:51:54.774 --> 01:51:56.376
HUMAN LIFE HUMAN LIFE IS A VERY

01:51:56.443 --> 01:51:57.544
PRECIOUS THING.

01:51:57.610 --> 01:51:58.912
THAT MUST BE PRESERVED AND

01:51:58.978 --> 01:52:00.013
PROTECTED.

01:52:00.080 --> 01:52:01.681
ESPECIALLY BY PEOPLE WHO ARE

01:52:01.748 --> 01:52:02.282
SUPPOSED TO SERVE AND PROTECT

01:52:02.348 --> 01:52:03.750
THE PUBLIC.

01:52:03.817 --> 01:52:04.984
THAT SHOULDN'T BE UP FOR DEBATE

01:52:05.051 --> 01:52:06.619
AND WE CAN'T PUT OFF ADDRESSING

01:52:06.686 --> 01:52:08.321
THIS PROBLEM ANY LONGER.

01:52:08.388 --> 01:52:09.422
ESPECIALLY WHEN WE KNOW THAT

01:52:09.489 --> 01:52:10.857
THERE ARE SOLUTIONS THAT WORK TO

01:52:10.924 --> 01:52:11.858
SAVE LVES.

01:52:11.925 --> 01:52:13.059
AND KEEP BOTH THE PUBLIC AND

01:52:13.126 --> 01:52:15.528
POLICE OFFICERS SAVE.

01:52:15.595 --> 01:52:17.430
UPDATING CALIFORNIA'S USE OF FOR

01:52:17.497 --> 01:52:18.398
STANDARD FROM THE REASONABLE

01:52:18.465 --> 01:52:20.133
STANDARD TO THE NECESSARY

01:52:20.200 --> 01:52:22.068
NECESSITY STANDARD IS A COMMON

01:52:22.135 --> 01:52:23.570
SENSE SOLUTION.

01:52:23.636 --> 01:52:27.273
BUT A GLARING OMISSION AND SB.

01:52:27.340 --> 01:52:28.641
TWO THIRTY RESEARCH SHOWS THAT

01:52:28.708 --> 01:52:30.276
OFFICERS AT AGENCIES WITH

01:52:30.343 --> 01:52:32.545
STRICTER USE OF POLICE -- POLICY

01:52:32.612 --> 01:52:34.814
FORCED USE OF FORCE POLICIES

01:52:34.881 --> 01:52:36.649

01:52:36.716 --> 01:52:38.852
LIKELY TO BE KILLED OR SERIOUSLY

01:52:38.918 --> 01:52:42.255
INJURED THEMSELVES.

01:52:42.322 --> 01:52:44.724
MY SON SHOULD BE ALIVE TODAY.

01:52:44.791 --> 01:52:46.459
UNFORTUNATELY NOTHING ANYONE.

01:52:46.526 --> 01:52:48.595
DOES WILL BRING HIM BACK.

01:52:48.661 --> 01:52:49.662
BUT I'M NOT GOING TO STOP

01:52:49.729 --> 01:52:51.364
FIGHTING FOR THIS.

01:52:51.431 --> 01:52:53.967
UNTIL PEOPLE ARE USE THE UNTIL

01:52:54.033 --> 01:52:56.402

WHEN THEY ARE NOT IN IMMINENT

01:52:57.470 --> 01:52:58.938
DANGER OR UNTIL I TAKE MY LAST

THEY ARE BEING STRIPPED FROM

01:59:40.606 --> 01:59:42.475
THIS BILL SINCE THIS BILL

01:59:42.542 --> 01:59:45.878
PROPOSES ONLY TO CODIFY THAT

01:59:45.945 --> 01:59:47.079
WHICH IS ALREADY IN PRACTICE.

01:59:47.146 --> 01:59:48.548
SO.

01:59:48.614 --> 01:59:49.882
THAT'S WHAT THE K. HOW THE

01:59:49.949 --> 01:59:51.384
COMMITTEE WITH A RECEIPT RIGHT --

01:59:51.450 --> 01:59:52.785
SO MOST OF MY COMMENTS I

01:59:52.852 --> 01:59:54.587
PREPARED WERE RELATED TO THOSE

01:59:54.654 --> 01:59:56.689
PROVISIONS SO I'M GOING TO SHIFT

01:59:56.756 --> 01:59:57.356
AND TALK A BIT MORE BROADLY

01:59:57.423 --> 01:59:58.057
ABOUT.

01:59:58.124 --> 02:00:00.726
THE NEED FOR SIGNIFICANT REFORM

02:00:00.793 --> 02:00:02.662
TO POLICE USE OF FORCE STANDARDS

02:00:02.728 --> 02:00:03.763
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

02:00:03.829 --> 02:00:05.298
SO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS

02:00:05.364 --> 02:00:06.832
ONE OF THE HIGHEST RATES OF

02:00:06.899 --> 02:00:07.466
DEADLY POLICE SHOOTINGS IN THE

02:00:07.533 --> 02:00:08.200
COUNTRY.

02:00:08.267 --> 02:00:09.435
ACCORDING TO THE WASHINGTON POST

02:00:09.502 --> 02:00:10.937
A HUNDRED AND SIXTY ONE PEOPLE

02:00:11.003 --> 02:00:12.305
WERE KILLED IN CAP BY CALIFORNIA

02:00:12.371 --> 02:00:14.941
POLICE IN TWO THOUSAND AND

02:00:15.007 --> 02:00:16.576
SEVENTEEN THAT WAS UP FROM ONE

02:00:16.642 --> 02:00:18.377
HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT IN TWO

02:00:18.444 --> 02:00:19.645
THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN HALF OF

02:00:19.712 --> 02:00:20.713
THOSE PEOPLE WHO WERE KILLED

02:00:20.780 --> 02:00:22.615
WERE NOT ARMED.

02:00:22.682 --> 02:00:23.249
AND THREE FORCE FOR PEOPLE OF

02:00:23.316 --> 02:00:25.785
COLOR -- PARTICULARLY OTHERS

02:00:25.851 --> 02:00:27.320
SIGNIFICANT INCREASING

02:00:27.386 --> 02:00:28.888
VULNERABILITY TO POLICE VIOLENCE

02:00:28.955 --> 02:00:30.590
FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE DISABILITIES

02:00:30.656 --> 02:00:32.191
PARTICULARLY PEOPLE OF COLOR SO

02:00:32.258 --> 02:00:33.693
I THINK THAT THAT'S RELEVANT

02:00:33.759 --> 02:00:34.794
ESPECIALLY GIVEN THAT THE

02:00:34.860 --> 02:00:36.028
CONVERSATION RELATED TO THE

02:00:36.095 --> 02:00:37.196
PREVIOUS BILL.

02:00:37.263 --> 02:00:38.331
PEOPLE OF COLOR PARTICULARLY

02:00:38.397 --> 02:00:39.899
AFRICAN AMERICANS ARE THREE

02:00:39.966 --> 02:00:41.200
POINT TWO TIMES MORE LIKELY TO

02:00:41.267 --> 02:00:42.401
BE KILLED NOT BY LAW ENFORCEMENT

02:00:42.468 --> 02:00:44.270
CALIFORNIA THAN THEIR WHITE

02:00:44.337 --> 02:00:46.372
COUNTERPARTS IN LA COUNTY WE

02:00:46.439 --> 02:00:50.443
HAVE SOME OF THE HIGHEST RATES.

02:00:50.509 --> 02:00:51.177
OF A USE OF FORCE.

02:00:51.243 --> 02:00:51.777
CALIFORNIA HAS ONE OF THE MOST

02:00:51.844 --> 02:00:53.279
ANTIQUATED STANDARDS OF OF

02:00:53.346 --> 02:00:54.680
POLICE USE OF FORCE IT WAS

02:00:54.747 --> 02:00:56.816
ENACTED IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY TWO

02:00:56.882 --> 02:00:57.450
AND IT'S BEEN CALLED THE SINGLE

02:00:57.516 --> 02:00:58.951
OLDEST UNAMENDED LAW ENFORCEMENT

02:00:59.018 --> 02:01:00.386
USE OF FOUR STATUTE IN THE

02:01:00.453 --> 02:01:01.187
COUNTRY.

02:01:01.253 --> 02:01:02.488
IT'S IN CONSISTENT WITH

02:01:02.555 --> 02:01:04.090
CONSTITUTIONAL STANDARDS ADOPTED

02:01:04.156 --> 02:01:06.225
BY THE SUPREME COURT RELATED TO

02:01:06.292 --> 02:01:07.760
GENERAL USE OF FORCE AND IT AS

02:01:07.827 --> 02:01:09.495
IT RELATES TO USE OF FORCE

02:01:09.562 --> 02:01:10.563
AGAINST WILL QUOTE UNQUOTE

02:01:10.630 --> 02:01:11.731
FLEEING FELONS.

02:01:11.797 --> 02:01:13.466
I TEACH CRIMINAL LAW ONE OF THE

02:01:13.532 --> 02:01:15.101
BASIC TENANTS OF SELF DEFENSE

02:01:15.167 --> 02:01:16.435
LAW IS THAT THE USE OF FORCE

02:01:16.502 --> 02:01:17.670
MUST BE IMMINENT.

02:01:17.737 --> 02:01:20.339
THAT IT MUST BE NECESSARY AND

02:01:20.406 --> 02:01:21.641
THAT THE USE OF FORCE MUST BE

02:01:21.707 --> 02:01:23.643
PROPORTIONAL NONE OF THOSE ARE

02:01:23.709 --> 02:01:25.878
PRESENT IN CURRENT LAW AND THEY

02:01:25.945 --> 02:01:27.480
SHOULD BE CIVILIANS ARE HELD TO

02:01:27.546 --> 02:01:30.082
THE STANDARD POLICE SHOULD BE

02:01:30.149 --> 02:01:31.751
HELD TO THE STANDARD.

02:01:31.817 --> 02:01:33.252
THE CHANGES IN THESE POLICIES

02:01:33.319 --> 02:01:36.956
PARTICULARLY A PROPOSED BY AB

02:01:37.023 --> 02:01:38.524
THREE NINETY TWO WILL SAVE LIVES.

02:01:38.591 --> 02:01:40.993
ONE STUDY FOUND THAT AMONG LARGE

02:01:41.060 --> 02:01:42.294
LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES IN

02:01:42.361 --> 02:01:43.663
NEARLY SO FOR STANDARD HAD

02:01:43.729 --> 02:01:46.532
RESULT IN FEWER I USE OF FORCE --

02:01:46.599 --> 02:01:48.067
USE OF USES OF FORCE AND FEWER

02:01:48.134 --> 02:01:49.602
POLICE SHOOTINGS.

02:01:49.669 --> 02:01:51.804
IN SOME IT ACTUALLY INCREASES

02:01:51.871 --> 02:01:54.407
POLICE OF SAFETY AND INCREASES

02:01:54.473 --> 02:01:55.875
PUBLIC SAFETY.

02:01:55.941 --> 02:01:57.943
CALIFORNIA CAN AND SHOULD FOLLOW

02:01:58.010 --> 02:01:59.779
SUIT AND WE SHOULD ADOPT

02:01:59.845 --> 02:02:01.447
STANDARDS THAT ARE MANDATORY AND

02:02:01.514 --> 02:02:03.115
THAT AT THAT EXIST ACROSS THE

02:02:03.182 --> 02:02:04.917
STATE FOR EXAMPLE IN THE PRIOR

02:02:04.984 --> 02:02:07.486
VERSION OF SB -- TO THIRTY THESE

02:02:07.553 --> 02:02:08.854
WERE SORT OF THEY WERE GENERAL

02:02:08.921 --> 02:02:10.589
MINIMUM STANDARDS BUT THEY COULD

02:02:10.656 --> 02:02:11.691
VERY ACROSS THE STATE.

02:02:11.757 --> 02:02:12.992
ONCE HONOR ABILITY TO POLICE

02:02:13.059 --> 02:02:14.026
VIOLENCE SHOULDN'T DEPEND ON

02:02:14.093 --> 02:02:15.394
WHAT ZIP CODE YOU LIVE IN RIGHT

02:02:15.461 --> 02:02:16.662
WE SHOULD ALL HAVE UNIFORM

02:02:16.729 --> 02:02:18.197
STANDARDS THAT PROTECT US

02:02:18.264 --> 02:02:20.166
AGAINST UNNECESSARY POLICE USE

02:02:20.232 --> 02:02:21.801
OF FORCE PARTICULARLY WHEN THE

02:02:21.867 --> 02:02:23.269
OFFICERS ARE ESCALATING.

02:02:23.335 --> 02:02:24.770
THE VIOLENCE AND THAT SHOULD BE

02:02:24.837 --> 02:02:26.005
TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION SO I

02:02:26.072 --> 02:02:27.506
THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT PIECE

02:02:27.573 --> 02:02:29.275
OF AB THREE NINETY TWO WHICH IS

02:02:29.341 --> 02:02:32.478
NOW BEEN JOINED WITH SB.

02:02:32.545 --> 02:02:33.145
TWO THIRTY WE SHOULD DEMAND THAT

02:02:33.212 --> 02:02:35.114
IN ORDER FOR THE STATE OR AGENTS

02:02:35.181 --> 02:02:36.615
TO TAKE A LIFE THAT THERE SHOULD

02:02:36.682 --> 02:02:38.184
BE NO REASONABLE ALTERNATIVE

02:50:37.093 --> 02:50:39.662
THE LANGUAGE THAT WOULD PUT INTO

02:50:39.729 --> 02:50:40.897
LAW.

02:50:40.964 --> 02:50:43.266

[inaudible]

02:51:00.350 --> 02:51:02.719

ANY LANGUAGE REGARDING USE OF

REGARDING TRAINING.

02:51:25.808 --> 02:51:28.878

GO INTO LAW.

02:51:34.350 --> 02:51:36.052
SO IN OTHER WORDS THE TRAINING

02:51:36.119 --> 02:51:39.422

02:51:39.489 --> 02:51:41.190
OF FORCE STANDARD.

02:51:41.257 --> 02:51:43.926

02:51:46.829 --> 02:51:48.064
IT DOES NOT.

STILL AVAILABLE TO THE AUTHOR --

02:52:21.597 --> 02:52:24.901

HEARD SOME PEOPLE SAY WE OPPOSE

02:56:49.365 --> 02:56:50.900

OF THE BILL AND SO YOUR PUBLIC

02:57:01.077 --> 02:57:02.845

BEFORE WE CAN VOTE ON BILLS ON

02:57:15.358 --> 02:57:16.325
THE FLOOR.

02:57:16.392 --> 02:57:17.827
THAT BILLS ARE IN PRINT AND SO

02:57:17.893 --> 02:57:20.062
WE CAN SEE IT READ AND DIGEST IT

02:57:20.129 --> 02:57:20.896
AND SO THAT'S THE PUBLIC

02:57:20.963 --> 02:57:22.898
RELATIONS PROBLEM WE HAVE SPENT

02:57:22.965 --> 02:57:26.002

02:58:19.055 --> 02:58:21.891
SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE CAN DO.

02:58:21.957 --> 02:58:25.161

DIGEST.

02:58:44.313 --> 02:58:45.314
AND PEOPLE TO BREAK OUT IN

02:58:45.381 --> 02:58:46.782
GROUPS THAT HAVE PEOPLE EXPLAIN

02:58:46.849 --> 02:58:47.683
WHAT'S IN THE BILL I DON'T KNOW

02:58:47.750 --> 02:58:48.751
HOW WE DO IT.

02:58:48.818 --> 02:58:50.386
THOSE ARE ALL SUGGESTIONS WE

02:58:50.453 --> 02:58:51.754
HAVE A PUBLIC RELATIONS PROBLEM

02:58:51.821 --> 02:58:53.989
THIS COPY HERE IN TERMS OF

02:58:54.056 --> 02:58:56.158
HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE NOT

02:58:56.225 --> 02:58:57.326
UNDERSTANDING.

02:58:57.393 --> 02:59:00.029
THE TRUE BILL THAT'S BEFORE US

02:59:00.096 --> 02:59:02.665
TODAY LET ME SAY THAT.

02:59:02.731 --> 02:59:05.434
LET ME SAY THAT ON TO THE

02:59:05.501 --> 02:59:07.036
OPPOSITION TO THE CHAIR.

02:59:07.103 --> 02:59:10.039
THAT I DISAGREE ON ONE POINT.

02:59:10.106 --> 02:59:12.241
WHEN PEOPLE SAY?

02:59:12.308 --> 02:59:15.344
NO TO TRAINING I DISAGREE.

02:59:15.411 --> 02:59:17.279
WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO

02:59:17.346 --> 02:59:19.014
CREATE A CULTURE SHIFT IN LAW

02:59:19.081 --> 02:59:20.182
ENFORCEMENT IN THE STATE IN THIS

02:59:20.249 --> 02:59:22.351
COUNTRY.

02:59:22.418 --> 02:59:23.486
AND SO WHY SUPPORT

02:59:23.552 --> 02:59:25.788
ACCOUNTABILITY I SAID I'M A CO

02:59:25.855 --> 02:59:27.189
AUTHOR BABY.

02:59:27.256 --> 02:59:28.557
THREE NINETY TWO WE ALSO HAVE TO

02:59:28.624 --> 02:59:29.792
MAKE SURE THAT WE CREATE

02:59:29.859 --> 02:59:32.094
OPPORTUNITIES. FOR LAW

02:59:32.161 --> 02:59:34.730
ENFORCEMENT TO CHANGE.

02:59:34.797 --> 02:59:36.332
THE AMENDED LANGUAGE AND I'VE

02:59:36.398 --> 02:59:37.933
HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF THING.

02:59:38.000 --> 02:59:39.768
NOT ONLY TALKS ABOUT.

02:59:39.835 --> 02:59:42.304
DE ESCALATION STRATEGIES.

02:59:42.371 --> 02:59:44.240
BUT SOME IMPORTANT WORDS THAT WE

02:59:44.306 --> 02:59:46.242
ARE USING QUITE LIBERALLY

02:59:46.308 --> 02:59:46.809
THROUGHOUT THIS LEGISLATIVE

02:59:46.876 --> 02:59:47.877
SESSION.

02:59:47.943 --> 02:59:51.180
AROUND IMPLICIT AND EXPLICIT BY.

02:59:51.247 --> 02:59:52.081
IT'S CLEAR TO ME THAT'S

02:59:52.148 --> 02:59:54.950
NECESSARY BECAUSE WE DO SEE A

02:59:55.017 --> 02:59:56.952
DIFFERENCE IN THE TREATMENT OF

02:59:57.019 --> 02:59:58.454
SORT OF CERTAIN.

02:59:58.521 --> 03:00:00.022
RESIDENTS OF THE STATE

03:00:00.089 --> 03:00:00.322
[inaudible]

03:00:00.389 --> 03:00:02.725
BASEBALL COMPLEXION.

03:00:02.791 --> 03:00:04.994
SO IMPLICIT BIAS TRAINING I

03:00:05.060 --> 03:00:06.595
BELIEVE IS FUNDAMENTAL AND

03:00:06.662 --> 03:00:07.897
IMPORTANT.

03:00:07.963 --> 03:00:08.931
AND I WILL NEVER NOT SUPPORT

03:00:08.998 --> 03:00:10.733
TRAINING [inaudible]

03:00:10.799 --> 03:00:12.635
THOSE WHO.

03:00:12.701 --> 03:00:15.671
BY COLOR OF AUTHORITY HAVE THE

03:00:15.738 --> 03:00:17.606
OPPORTUNITY TO PROTECT

ABBREVIATED TERMINOLOGY THAT'S

03:02:16.258 --> 03:02:18.661

THIRTY PERIOD.

03:07:29.137 --> 03:07:30.839
ALL OF THE USE OF FORCE LANGUAGE

03:07:30.906 --> 03:07:33.408
IS BEING STRIPPED OUT OF SB

03:07:33.475 --> 03:07:35.010
THREE THIRTY SO THOSE ARE THE

03:07:35.077 --> 03:07:36.445
TWO APPROACHES AND THEY ARE

03:07:36.511 --> 03:07:38.380
COMPLEMENTARY TO ONE ANOTHER

03:07:38.447 --> 03:07:40.549
SETTING THE USE OF FORCE STANNIS

03:07:40.616 --> 03:07:42.150
MAYBE.

03:07:42.217 --> 03:07:42.684
THREE NINETY TWO AND THEN

03:07:42.751 --> 03:07:45.687
REQUIRING TRAINING -- AND THE

03:07:45.754 --> 03:07:47.255
OUR PROCESS IS IN PERFECT

03:07:47.322 --> 03:07:49.524
SOMETIMES -- IN TERMS OF

03:07:49.591 --> 03:07:50.726
LANGUAGE BEING TAKEN IN

03:07:50.792 --> 03:07:53.695
COMMITTEE AND SO IT HASN'T BEEN --

03:07:53.762 --> 03:07:55.964
IMPRINT BEFORE -- BUT THAT'S

03:07:56.031 --> 03:07:56.999
WHAT THIS WILL DO.

03:07:57.065 --> 03:07:58.533
NOW AND AGAIN I DO LOOK FORWARD

03:07:58.600 --> 03:08:00.369

TOGETHER -- TO REMOVE THE USE OF

03:08:11.380 --> 03:08:13.382
FORCE LANGUAGE FROM SB TWO

03:08:13.448 --> 03:08:13.915

03:08:13.982 --> 03:08:16.151
TRAINING BILL -- AND I DO AGREE

03:08:16.218 --> 03:08:18.053
WITH US CENTER MITCHELL TRAINING

03:08:18.120 --> 03:08:20.088
IS IMPORTANT IT'S NOT THE ONLY

03:08:20.155 --> 03:08:22.224
THING WE NEED TRAINING BY ITSELF

03:08:22.290 --> 03:08:23.859
DOES NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM.

03:08:23.925 --> 03:08:25.961
OF THE TRAINING IS A PIECE OF

03:08:26.028 --> 03:08:27.062
THE PUZZLE.

03:08:27.129 --> 03:08:31.867
IN SOLVING.

03:08:31.933 --> 03:08:35.604
THE PROBLEM THANK YOU.

MY COLLEAGUES AND HOPE NO ONE'S

03:08:44.012 --> 03:08:46.682
DEPARTING YET -- BECAUSE WE

03:08:46.748 --> 03:08:47.949
OBVIOUSLY HAVE A COUPLE OF

03:08:48.016 --> 03:08:52.421
THINGS -- BEFORE US -- THE FIRST

03:08:52.487 --> 03:08:55.691
[inaudible] FIVE AS I EXPLAINED

03:08:55.757 --> 03:08:58.994
IN THE OPENING AND PERHAPS NOT --

03:08:59.061 --> 03:09:03.331
WITH ENOUGH CLARITY.

03:09:03.398 --> 03:09:05.000
WHAT WE ARE DOING TODAY OR WHAT

03:09:05.067 --> 03:09:07.102
WE ARE ENTERTAINING TO DO TODAY

03:09:07.169 --> 03:09:07.402
[inaudible]

03:09:07.469 --> 03:09:12.774
IS.

03:09:12.841 --> 03:09:13.608
I APPRECIATE CAN BE.

03:09:13.675 --> 03:09:21.483
ON DIFFICULT -- TO TO EXCEPT

03:09:21.550 --> 03:09:25.153
BECAUSE MANY FOLKS AND

03:09:25.220 --> 03:09:26.254
LEGITIMATELY HAVE BEEN

03:09:26.321 --> 03:09:28.757
ORGANIZING AGAINST THE BILL AS

03:09:28.824 --> 03:09:30.058
IT IS IN PRINT.

03:09:30.125 --> 03:09:33.829
BECAUSE OF THE FEELINGS THAT.

03:09:33.895 --> 03:09:37.065
IN FACT BY JUST PUTTING INTO LAW.

03:09:37.132 --> 03:09:39.301
THE WHAT MANY PEOPLE FEEL IS A

03:09:39.367 --> 03:09:42.237
VERY ANTIQUATED IN ADEQUATE AND

03:09:42.304 --> 03:09:45.006
I'M JUST USE OF FORCE STANDARD.

03:09:45.073 --> 03:09:47.642
THAT IF SB TWO THIRTY WERE TO

03:09:47.709 --> 03:09:49.911
PROCEED AS IT WAS WRITTEN THAT

03:09:49.978 --> 03:09:51.413
IT WOULD JUST BE ALLOWING THE

03:09:51.480 --> 03:09:53.448
POLICE TO CONTINUE TO DO

03:09:53.515 --> 03:09:54.549
BUSINESS AS USUAL.

03:09:54.616 --> 03:09:56.718
AND I WHAT I'D LIKE TO CONVEY IS

03:09:56.785 --> 03:09:58.420
I THINK YOU'VE HEARD FROM AT

03:09:58.487 --> 03:10:00.088
LEAST THE MAJORITY OF THE

03:10:00.155 --> 03:10:00.922
MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE IS

03:10:00.989 --> 03:10:03.158
THAT THAT IS NOT WHAT THEY WANT

03:10:03.225 --> 03:10:04.493
TO DO SO IN OTHER WORDS THIS

03:10:04.559 --> 03:10:06.194
SENATE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE

03:10:06.261 --> 03:10:07.629
THE MAJORITY OF ITS MEMBERS.

03:10:07.696 --> 03:10:10.932
ARE NOT WILLING.

03:10:10.999 --> 03:10:12.601
TO PUT INTO LAW.

03:10:12.667 --> 03:10:15.470
THE USE OF FORCE STANDARD AS IT

03:10:15.537 --> 03:10:18.840
EXISTS TODAY -- BUT WE DO NOT

03:10:18.907 --> 03:10:21.309
HAVE BEFORE US A BILL THAT

03:10:21.376 --> 03:10:23.678
PROPOSES THE REVISED MEANING

03:10:23.745 --> 03:10:25.447
TODAY IN THIS COMMITTEE.

03:10:25.514 --> 03:10:28.083
THE BILL THAT PROPOSES A REVISED

03:10:28.150 --> 03:10:32.654
USE OF FORCE IS -- ASSEMBLY

03:10:32.721 --> 03:10:36.224
MEMBER WEBER SPELL SO IN WORKING

03:10:36.291 --> 03:10:37.425
WITH THE AUTHORS.

03:10:37.492 --> 03:10:39.461
WHAT THIS COMMITTEE THOUGHT WAS

03:10:39.528 --> 03:10:43.498
REASONABLE WAS?

03:10:43.565 --> 03:10:44.966
TO LINK THE BILLS.

03:10:45.033 --> 03:10:48.570
SO THAT.

03:10:48.637 --> 03:10:51.640
THIS BILL WOULD ONLY BECOME LAW.

03:10:51.706 --> 03:10:54.376
IF THERE IS A REVISED USE OF

03:10:54.442 --> 03:10:58.280
FORCE MEANING AB.

03:10:58.346 --> 03:10:59.481
THREE NINETY TWO AND THE REASON

03:10:59.548 --> 03:11:02.017
THAT I IS THE COMMITTEE CHAIR.

03:11:02.083 --> 03:11:05.654
WAS WILLING TO HAVE A PORTION OF

03:11:05.720 --> 03:11:07.055
SB.

03:11:07.122 --> 03:11:08.323
TWO THIRTY MOVE FORWARD IS

03:11:08.390 --> 03:11:12.928
BECAUSE IF WE DO RE VICE OUR USE

03:11:12.994 --> 03:11:14.529
OF FORCE STANDARD.

03:11:14.596 --> 03:11:17.365
THEN WE WILL REQUIRE NEW

03:11:17.432 --> 03:11:20.235
TRAINING BECAUSE RIGHT NOW.

03:11:20.302 --> 03:11:22.871
THE ONLY TRAINING THAT OUR STATE

03:11:22.938 --> 03:11:25.907
WIDE AGENCY OFFERS IS ON THE

03:11:25.974 --> 03:11:27.275
EXISTING STANDARD.

03:11:27.342 --> 03:11:29.678
AND SO IF WE ARE SUCCESSFUL IN

03:11:29.744 --> 03:11:32.147
REVISING THE STANDARD.

03:11:32.214 --> 03:11:34.816
AND MAKING IT MORE FAIR OR

03:11:34.883 --> 03:11:36.685
HOWEVER ANYONE WANTS TO

03:11:36.751 --> 03:11:38.153
CHARACTERIZE.

03:11:38.220 --> 03:11:39.454
THE REVISION.

03:11:39.521 --> 03:11:41.389
THEN WE WOULD NEED NEW TRAINING

03:11:41.456 --> 03:11:43.558
BECAUSE IF WE DON'T GET NEW

03:11:43.625 --> 03:11:45.460
TRAINING THEN OFFICERS WOULD

03:11:45.527 --> 03:11:48.096
STILL BE OPERATING UNDER THE OLD

03:11:48.163 --> 03:11:49.931
ONE SO THAT'S WHY AT LEAST AS

03:11:49.998 --> 03:11:52.734
CHAIR I WAS WILLING. TO HAVE THE

03:11:52.801 --> 03:11:56.071
TRAINING PORTION CONTINUE BUT

03:11:56.137 --> 03:12:00.575
ONLY IF IT IS BASED ON A REVISED

03:12:00.642 --> 03:12:02.711
USE OF FORCE STANDARD.

03:12:02.777 --> 03:12:05.747
SO -- AND I WANTED TO SPEAK TO

03:12:05.814 --> 03:12:06.648
ALSO.

03:12:06.715 --> 03:12:11.253
THE THE ISSUE AROUND -- AROUND

03:12:11.319 --> 03:12:12.754
THE BIAS.

03:12:12.821 --> 03:12:15.223
AND CITING FROM A STUDY THAT I

03:12:15.290 --> 03:12:17.125
WAS NOT FAMILIAR WITH UNTIL JUST

03:12:17.192 --> 03:12:18.260
RECENTLY [inaudible]

03:12:18.326 --> 03:12:21.763
BUT FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE --

03:12:21.830 --> 03:12:23.765
INTERESTED IN THIS STUDIES

03:12:23.832 --> 03:12:25.867
DATING BACK TO AT LEAST TWO

03:12:25.934 --> 03:12:28.036
THOUSAND AND ONE FOUND THAT THE

03:12:28.103 --> 03:12:31.339
SAME AS REGULAR RESIDENTS.

03:12:31.406 --> 03:12:34.476
POLICE OFFICERS CIVILIANS RESIN.

03:12:34.542 --> 03:12:36.144
ANYONE EVERYONE HERE IN OUR

03:12:36.211 --> 03:12:39.381
CULTURE ARE CONSISTENTLY MORE

03:12:39.447 --> 03:12:43.184
LIKELY TO ASSOCIATE BLACK FACES

03:12:43.251 --> 03:12:44.886
WITH CRIMINALITY.

03:12:44.953 --> 03:12:46.922
ENTER MISIDENTIFIED COMMON

03:12:46.988 --> 03:12:49.424
OBJECTS AS WEAPONS.

03:12:49.491 --> 03:12:52.027
AFTER BEING SHOWN PHOTOS OF

03:12:52.093 --> 03:12:52.727
BLACK FACES.

03:12:52.794 --> 03:12:54.596
SO IN OTHER WORDS.

03:12:54.663 --> 03:12:55.864
LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS OR ANY

03:12:55.931 --> 03:12:57.933
OF US.

03:12:57.999 --> 03:13:00.368
THE STUDY SHOW.

03:13:00.435 --> 03:13:03.538
REACT AFTER WE SEE.

03:13:03.605 --> 03:13:05.206
PICTURES OF BLACK FACES.

03:13:05.273 --> 03:13:07.375
WE REACT BOTH AN ASSOCIATE

03:13:07.442 --> 03:13:08.343
CRIMINALITY.

03:13:08.410 --> 03:13:11.146
AND ASSUME THAT OBJECTS THAT ARE

03:13:11.212 --> 03:13:13.682
NOT WEAPONS OUR WEAPONS.

03:13:13.748 --> 03:13:16.151
SO THIS AND THIS IS WHAT WE

03:13:16.217 --> 03:13:18.019
REFER TO AS IMPLICIT BIAS.

03:13:18.086 --> 03:13:22.557

ENTITLED -- TO RESPOND -- BUT I

03:16:04.786 --> 03:16:08.256
ALSO JUST WANT TO SAY THAT --

03:16:08.323 --> 03:16:10.225
EVEN IF WE HAD PUT THE BILL IN

03:16:10.291 --> 03:16:11.559
PRINT.

03:16:11.626 --> 03:16:13.328
AS A AND AGREED TO AMENDMENTS

03:16:13.394 --> 03:16:15.597
EARLIER I THINK THAT MANY OF YOU

03:16:15.663 --> 03:16:17.232
WOULD HAVE WANTED TO BE HEARING

03:16:17.298 --> 03:16:20.068

TRAUMATIC IT IS TO TALK ABOUT.

03:16:26.641 --> 03:16:28.076
THE LOSS OF YOUR LOVED ONES.

03:16:28.143 --> 03:16:30.445
AGAIN AND TO DO IT IN PUBLIC AND

03:16:30.512 --> 03:16:32.213
IT'S INCREDIBLY COURAGEOUS AND

03:16:32.280 --> 03:16:34.482
BRAVE BUT I ALSO WANT TO RESPECT

03:16:34.549 --> 03:16:35.750
THAT.

03:16:35.817 --> 03:16:38.853
IT IS AS DIFFICULT AS IT IS I

03:16:38.920 --> 03:16:40.555
THANK ALL OF YOU WANT US TO BEAR

AND SO I THINK THAT EVEN IF WE

03:16:44.893 --> 03:16:44.993
HAD.

03:16:45.059 --> 03:16:48.062

TODAY -- I KNOW THAT -- IT HAS

03:17:46.387 --> 03:17:47.889

03:17:52.794 --> 03:17:53.828
TO TALK ABOUT THINGS THAT ARE

03:17:53.895 --> 03:17:56.464
VERY VERY DIFFICULT -- AND IT'S

03:17:56.531 --> 03:17:58.466

HERE IS BECAUSE WE WANT TO BE

03:18:21.356 --> 03:18:22.490
ABLE TO MAKE SOME CHANGE AND IT

03:18:22.557 --> 03:18:25.326

03:18:25.393 --> 03:18:27.729
THE BILL AS IT IS AND IT'S

03:18:27.795 --> 03:18:29.530
DIFFICULT TO TALK ABOUT BECAUSE

03:18:29.597 --> 03:18:31.933
WE END UP TALKING ABOUT IT IN

03:18:32.000 --> 03:18:33.735
TERMS OF THE HOW WE DEAL WITH

03:18:33.801 --> 03:18:35.270
BILLS HERE IN SACRAMENTO BUT THE

03:18:35.336 --> 03:18:36.571
BOTTOM LINE.

03:18:36.638 --> 03:18:40.742
IS THE PART THAT PERTAINS TO AB

03:18:40.808 --> 03:18:41.809

OF MY BILL.

03:18:43.511 --> 03:18:45.079

03:35:28.849 --> 03:35:31.451
WHEN HE COULDN'T HURT HER?

03:35:31.518 --> 03:35:32.986
HE TURNED TO HER SON.

03:35:33.053 --> 03:35:34.354
DATA SHOWS MULTIPLE REASONS WHY

03:35:34.421 --> 03:35:35.622
SURVIVORS OF ABUSE MAY NOT COME

03:35:35.689 --> 03:35:37.124

AS I SHARED EARLIER THIS ISSUE

03:35:47.868 --> 03:35:49.102
IS VERY PERSONAL TO ME.

03:35:49.169 --> 03:35:50.771
MY STORY WAS PUBLICIZING THE

03:35:50.837 --> 03:35:52.973
MEDIA HUNDREDS OF WOMEN CAME

03:35:53.040 --> 03:35:54.474
OVER TO TELL ME ABOUT THEIR

03:35:54.541 --> 03:35:56.943
TRAUMA. ONE WOMAN IN PARTICULAR

03:35:57.010 --> 03:35:58.945
SHARED HER STORY ABOUT AN

03:35:59.012 --> 03:36:00.113

03:36:00.180 --> 03:36:02.349
ABUSE THAT SHE HAD TO INDOOR.

03:36:02.416 --> 03:36:04.985

ENDED SHE NEVER HAD THE TO TELL

03:36:06.386 --> 03:36:09.389

03:36:17.998 --> 03:36:18.665
TO JUMP.

03:36:18.732 --> 03:36:20.801
THIS IS WHY SB TWO SEVENTY THREE

03:36:20.867 --> 03:36:22.869
IS A VERY CRITICAL PIECE OF

03:36:22.936 --> 03:36:24.304
LEGISLATION.

03:36:24.371 --> 03:36:25.439
BUT WHEN THEY DO FIND THE

03:36:25.505 --> 03:36:27.341
COURAGE TO SEEK JUSTICE WE MUST

03:36:27.407 --> 03:36:31.411
ALLOW THEM THE OPPORTUNITY. FOR

03:36:31.478 --> 03:36:33.914

03:36:56.670 --> 03:36:58.205
WHEN IT EVENTUALLY DID I WASN'T

03:36:58.271 --> 03:36:59.239
SURE HOW TO STOP IT AS HE HAD A

03:36:59.306 --> 03:37:01.208
CERTAIN CHARISMA AND POWER IN A

03:37:01.274 --> 03:37:01.775
QUICKLY SURRENDERED TO HIS

03:37:01.842 --> 03:37:02.342
CHARMS?

03:37:02.409 --> 03:37:03.410
IN THE BEGINNING HE TREATED ME

03:37:03.477 --> 03:37:05.011
LIKE A PRINCESS I WAS SMART BUT

03:37:05.078 --> 03:37:06.279
SMART EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD TO STILL

03:37:06.346 --> 03:37:07.681
IN EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD AND I

03:37:07.748 --> 03:37:08.749
THOUGHT I HAD PHONE LOVE.

03:37:08.815 --> 03:37:09.883
IT WASN'T UNTIL MUCH LATER THAT

03:37:09.950 --> 03:37:11.151
I REALIZED EVERYTHING YOU TOLD

03:37:11.218 --> 03:37:12.719
ME WAS A LIE AND PART OF WHAT IS

03:37:12.786 --> 03:37:14.020
CALLED THE GROOMING PROCESS HE

03:37:14.087 --> 03:37:15.489
DIDN'T A TERRIBLE DRUG AND

03:37:15.555 --> 03:37:18.692
ALCOHOL PROBLEM FOR ME.

03:37:18.759 --> 03:37:19.659
FAST IN A RELATIONSHIP ASKING ME

03:37:19.726 --> 03:37:20.527
TO MOVE IN WITH HIM ALMOST

03:37:20.594 --> 03:37:21.428
IMMEDIATELY THERE'S A CERTAIN

03:37:21.495 --> 03:37:22.396
WAY HE WANTED ME TO LOOK

03:37:22.462 --> 03:37:23.597
OTHERWISE I WOULDN'T OR NAME

03:37:23.663 --> 03:37:24.731
CALLING AND RITUAL.

03:37:24.798 --> 03:37:26.166
HE CUT ME OFF FOR MY CLOSE

03:37:26.233 --> 03:37:27.601
FRIENDS AND FAMILY ONE BY ONE BY

03:37:27.667 --> 03:37:29.035
EXHIBITING RAGE IN SOME FORM OR

03:37:29.102 --> 03:37:30.203
ANOTHER WHEN I WAS IN CONTACT

03:37:30.270 --> 03:37:31.071
WITH THEM.

03:37:31.138 --> 03:37:31.905
THE ONLY WAY NEWT ECONOMIST A

03:37:31.972 --> 03:37:32.906
GIVEN WHAT HE WANTED WHICH WAS

03:37:32.973 --> 03:37:34.474
ME ALL TO HIMSELF IN TOTAL

03:37:34.541 --> 03:37:35.442
ISOLATION.

03:37:35.509 --> 03:37:36.676
HE HAD BOUTS OF EXTREME JEALOUSY

03:37:36.743 --> 03:37:37.978
WHICH WOULD OFTEN RESULT IN HIM

03:37:38.044 --> 03:37:39.880
WRECKING OUR HOME CORNING ME IN

03:37:39.946 --> 03:37:41.381
A ROOM AND THREATENING ME.

03:37:41.448 --> 03:37:42.215
I WOULD MISS MY VIEWS ARE

03:37:42.282 --> 03:37:43.083
STARTING PEOPLE WITH FORCE OR

03:37:43.150 --> 03:37:44.217
LEGAL ACTION IF YOU WORRIED THEY

03:37:44.284 --> 03:37:45.652
WOULD EXPOSE HIM HE BRAGGED

03:37:45.719 --> 03:37:46.987
ABOUT BEING ABLE TO HAVE PEOPLE

03:37:47.053 --> 03:37:48.288
KILLED BECAUSE HE WAS ALLEGEDLY

03:37:48.355 --> 03:37:49.222
FRIENDS WITH MULTIPLE GANGS AND

03:37:49.289 --> 03:37:51.124
I WATCHED ILLEGALLY COLLECT DATA

03:37:51.191 --> 03:37:51.758
ON PEOPLE THAT HE COULD USE HIS

03:37:51.825 --> 03:37:52.959
BLACKMAIL.

03:37:53.026 --> 03:37:53.827
BY THE TIME I REALIZED I WAS IN

03:37:53.894 --> 03:37:54.895
A BAD SITUATION I FELT

03:37:54.961 --> 03:37:59.099
COMPLETELY TRAPPED IN TERRIFIED

03:37:59.166 --> 03:38:00.867
FOR MY LIFE.

03:38:00.934 --> 03:38:01.701
HE GIFTED ME A CELL PHONE WHICH

03:38:01.768 --> 03:38:03.170
I FOUND OUT HE WAS MONITORING E

03:38:03.236 --> 03:38:03.837
DOWNLOADED SPY WARE ON TO MY

03:38:03.904 --> 03:38:04.404
COMPUTER AND HACKED INTO MY

03:38:04.471 --> 03:38:06.206
EMAILS AND SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNTS

03:38:06.273 --> 03:38:06.773
SO I COULD NOT REACH OUT FOR

03:38:06.840 --> 03:38:07.240
HELP.

03:38:07.307 --> 03:38:08.508
MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY TRY TO

03:38:08.575 --> 03:38:09.276
INTERVENE I SIMPLY TOLD THEM TO

03:38:09.342 --> 03:38:11.812
LEAVE BECAUSE I WAS AFRAID OF

03:38:11.878 --> 03:38:12.746
WHAT HE WOULD DO.

03:38:12.813 --> 03:38:13.613
HE BROKE ME DOWN THROUGH MEANS

03:38:13.680 --> 03:38:14.581
OF STARVATION SLEEP DEPRIVATION

03:38:14.648 --> 03:38:15.782
AND THREATS AGAINST MY LIFE

03:38:15.849 --> 03:38:17.117
SOMETIMES WITH DEADLY WEAPONS

03:38:17.184 --> 03:38:18.351
WHICH WOULD RESULT IN ME HAVING

03:38:18.418 --> 03:38:21.087
SEVERE PANIC ATTACKS WHERE I WAS

03:38:21.154 --> 03:38:21.621
UNABLE TO BREATHE OR STOP

03:38:21.688 --> 03:38:22.456
SHAKING.

03:38:22.522 --> 03:38:24.090
SOMETIMES YOU WOULD NOT ALLOW ME

03:38:24.157 --> 03:38:26.760
TO SLEEP UNTIL I PARTICIPATED IN

03:38:26.827 --> 03:38:27.494
ACTS OF FEAR PAIN.

03:38:27.561 --> 03:38:31.231
TORTURE AND HUMILIATION WHICH I

03:38:31.298 --> 03:38:33.333
FELT POWERLESS TO STOP.

03:38:33.400 --> 03:38:35.168
IN SOME OF THESE TAPES.

03:38:35.235 --> 03:38:37.037
WHICH HE ALSO VIDEOTAPED.

03:38:37.103 --> 03:38:38.305
IN SOME OF THESE TAPES HE CAN BE

03:38:38.371 --> 03:38:39.272
HEARD THREATENING TO KILL ME

03:38:39.339 --> 03:38:41.341
THREATEN MY FRIENDS ARE

03:38:41.408 --> 03:38:41.942
THREATENING TO KILL MEMBERS OF

03:38:42.008 --> 03:38:43.944
MY FAMILY.

03:38:44.010 --> 03:38:45.278
HE ALSO THREATENED TO LEAK PARTS

03:38:45.345 --> 03:38:46.413
OF THE FOOTAGE OR PHOTOGRAPHS

03:38:46.480 --> 03:38:48.114
YOU TAKEN AS A WAY TO KEEP ME

03:38:48.181 --> 03:38:48.748
QUIET.

03:38:48.815 --> 03:38:50.083
I MUSTERED THE COURAGE TO LEAVE

03:38:50.150 --> 03:38:51.518
SEVERAL TIMES BUT HE WOULD CALL

03:38:51.585 --> 03:38:52.953
MY HOUSE INCESSANTLY AND

03:38:53.019 --> 03:38:54.788
THREATENED TO KILL HIMSELF.

03:38:54.855 --> 03:38:55.889
ON ONE OCCASION I RETURNED TO

03:38:55.956 --> 03:38:57.624
TRYING TO FUSE THE SITUATION HE

03:38:57.691 --> 03:38:59.292
CORNERED ME IN OUR BEDROOM AND

03:38:59.359 --> 03:39:01.528
ASKED ME TO KNEEL WELL HE TIED

03:39:01.595 --> 03:39:03.563
ME UP BY MY HANDS AND FEET.

03:39:03.630 --> 03:39:06.166
ONCE I WAS RESTRAINED HE BEAT ME.

03:39:06.233 --> 03:39:08.134
AND SHOT SENSITIVE PARTS OF MY

03:39:08.201 --> 03:39:10.937
BODY WITH A TORTURE DEVICE

03:39:11.004 --> 03:39:12.472
CALLED A VIOLENT. ONE TO HIM IT

03:39:12.539 --> 03:39:13.573
WAS A WAY FOR ME TO PROVE MY

03:39:13.640 --> 03:39:14.508
LOYALTY.

03:39:14.574 --> 03:39:15.809
THE WORST PART WAS I STILL FELT

03:39:15.876 --> 03:39:17.344
IT WAS SOMEHOW MY FAULT BECAUSE

03:39:17.410 --> 03:39:18.178
SOCIETY HAD TOLD ME I SHOULD

03:39:18.245 --> 03:39:19.379
JUST LEAVE WHEN SOMEONE HITS ME

03:39:19.446 --> 03:39:20.647
BUT THIS WAS SO MUCH MORE

03:39:20.714 --> 03:39:22.182
COMPLICATED AND SO MUCH SCARIER

03:39:22.249 --> 03:39:24.985
THAN ANYTHING HAD EVER PREPARED

03:39:25.051 --> 03:39:25.552
ME FOR I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO

03:39:25.619 --> 03:39:26.353
CALL IT.

03:39:26.419 --> 03:39:27.687
AFTER THIS INCIDENT I PLAYED

03:39:27.754 --> 03:39:29.256
ALONG WITH WHATEVER HE WANTED

03:39:29.322 --> 03:39:30.724
AND DURING CONSTANT DAILY ABUSE

03:39:30.790 --> 03:39:32.292
AND ON OCCASION RIGHT UNTIL I

03:39:32.359 --> 03:39:33.827
FOUND A WAY TO ESCAPE SAFELY.

03:39:33.894 --> 03:39:36.596
YEARS LATER MY THERAPIST WOULD

03:39:36.663 --> 03:39:37.097
IDENTIFY THIS A STOCKHAM

03:39:37.163 --> 03:39:38.164
SYNDROME.

03:39:38.231 --> 03:39:40.734
ONCE I WAS FINALLY OUT OF MY

03:39:40.800 --> 03:39:41.334
FEEL SAFE WHICH MEANT PUTTING

03:39:41.401 --> 03:39:43.537
TIME AND SPACE BETWEEN ME HIM IN

03:39:43.603 --> 03:39:44.971
THE ABUSE.

03:39:45.038 --> 03:39:46.706
THE SHAME IS STILL OVERWHELMING

03:39:46.773 --> 03:39:47.741
AND IT'S TAKEN ALL OF MY

03:39:47.807 --> 03:39:49.476
STRENGTH TO SPEAK PUBLICLY AND

03:39:49.543 --> 03:39:51.044
TO PURSUE THIS EVEN TODAY.

03:39:51.111 --> 03:39:52.612
THE FEAR BEING JUDGED BY SOCIETY

03:39:52.679 --> 03:39:54.581
IS DEBILITATING AND THE FEAR OF

03:39:54.648 --> 03:39:55.715
RETALIATION FROM MY ABUSER IS

03:39:55.782 --> 03:39:57.117
PARALYZING.

03:39:57.183 --> 03:39:58.151
BY SPEAKING TO YOU TODAY AND

03:39:58.218 --> 03:39:59.786
EVERYDAY I PUT MYSELF AT RISK AS

03:39:59.853 --> 03:40:01.588
I HAVE NO PROTECTION.

03:40:01.655 --> 03:40:02.422
I HAD TO GO THROUGH INTENSE

03:40:02.489 --> 03:40:03.623
THERAPY TO EVEN FULLY UNDERSTAND

03:40:03.690 --> 03:40:04.624
WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO ME AND I'VE

03:40:04.691 --> 03:40:06.893
BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH COMPLEX PTSD.

03:40:06.960 --> 03:40:08.128
I'M STILL IN THE PROCESS OF

03:40:08.194 --> 03:40:09.629
WORKING THROUGH THIS.

03:40:09.696 --> 03:40:11.097
THE FINAL PUSH INTO CREATING THE

03:40:11.164 --> 03:40:12.232
PHOENIX ACT WITH THE CRUSHING

03:40:12.299 --> 03:40:13.500
REALIZATION YEARS LATER THAT HE

03:40:13.567 --> 03:40:15.035
HAD DONE THIS TO SEVERAL PEOPLE

03:40:15.101 --> 03:40:16.336
AND IT WAS VERY LIKELY THEY WERE

03:40:16.403 --> 03:40:17.637
MORE VICTIMS.

03:40:17.704 --> 03:40:18.505
SO I TRIED TO TAKE MY EVIDENCE

03:40:18.572 --> 03:40:20.473
TO THE STATE AN ATTEMPT TO STOP

03:40:20.540 --> 03:40:21.074
THIS FROM HAPPENING TO ANYONE

03:40:21.141 --> 03:40:21.975
ELSE.

03:40:22.042 --> 03:40:23.510
MY EVIDENCE INCLUDED PHOTOGRAPHS

03:40:23.577 --> 03:40:25.979
AND VIDEO NOT JUST RELYING ON

03:40:26.046 --> 03:40:27.247
MEMORY.

03:40:27.314 --> 03:40:28.014
CANNOT BE VIEWED BY THE STATE

03:40:28.081 --> 03:40:29.049
BECAUSE THE SUCH A LIMITATION SO

03:40:29.115 --> 03:40:30.584
MANY CASES RUN OUT.

03:40:30.650 --> 03:40:31.718
AND I'VE LIVED TO WITH THE

03:40:31.785 --> 03:40:34.321
SILENCE AND SHAME FOR TOO LONG

03:40:34.387 --> 03:40:35.522
AND IT HAS BEEN UNBEARABLE.

03:40:35.589 --> 03:40:37.023
IT'S TAKING YEARS FROM MY LIFE

03:40:37.090 --> 03:40:38.892
BECAUSE I WAS TOO AFRAID TO TELL

03:40:38.959 --> 03:40:39.893
ANYONE.

03:40:39.960 --> 03:40:41.027
I KNOW THAT THIS BILL WILL NOT

03:40:41.094 --> 03:40:43.096
AFFECT MY CASE BUT I URGE YOU TO

03:40:43.163 --> 03:40:44.764
VOTE YES ON THE PHOENIX ACT TO

03:40:44.831 --> 03:40:46.900
CREATE A CUSHION FOR VICTIMS TO

03:40:46.967 --> 03:40:48.268
LEAVE THEIR DANGEROUS SITUATIONS.

03:40:48.335 --> 03:40:49.769
GET THE HELP THEY NEED I COME

03:40:49.836 --> 03:40:51.438
BACK FROM THE TRAUMA IN ORDER TO

03:40:51.504 --> 03:40:53.073
PURSUE JUSTICE AND STOP SERIAL

03:40:53.139 --> 03:40:55.375
ABUSERS AS LONG AS THEY HAVE

03:40:55.442 --> 03:40:56.443
UNDENIABLE EVIDENCE.

03:40:56.509 --> 03:40:57.744
WE DO NOT WISH TO CREATE NEW

03:40:57.811 --> 03:40:59.145
LAWS ARE HARSHER PUNISHMENTS

03:40:59.212 --> 03:41:00.747
ONLY MORE TIME IF THE EVIDENCE

03:41:00.814 --> 03:41:01.881
MEETS THE CRITERIA WE ARE

03:41:01.948 --> 03:41:03.516
PUTTING FORWARD.

03:41:03.583 --> 03:41:06.152
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME FOR

03:41:06.219 --> 03:41:07.387
HEARING US TODAY.

03:41:07.454 --> 03:41:09.356
ADAM SHARE I'M SORRY I FEEL TO

ANOTHER SURVIVOR SPHERE WITH ME

03:41:13.727 --> 03:41:13.960
TO TELL HER.

03:41:14.027 --> 03:41:20.900
STORY THANK YOU GO AHEAD.

03:41:20.967 --> 03:41:23.570
THANK YOU SENATOR IN COMMITTEE.

03:41:23.637 --> 03:41:25.372
THANK YOU SENATE COMMITTEE.

03:41:25.438 --> 03:41:26.172
I JUST WANTED TO SAY I'M HERE

03:41:26.239 --> 03:41:27.674
ALSO IN SUPPORT OF THE PHOENIX

03:41:27.741 --> 03:41:29.643
AT SB.

03:41:29.709 --> 03:41:30.243
TWO SEVEN THREE I'M INTRODUCED

03:41:30.310 --> 03:41:30.777
BY SENATOR RUBIO BECAUSE I

03:41:30.844 --> 03:41:31.311
BELIEVE IT WAS DRAFTED IN

03:41:31.378 --> 03:41:32.612
RESPONSE TO THE OUTCRY FROM

03:41:32.679 --> 03:41:34.047
PEOPLE LIKE ME SURVIVORS AN

03:41:34.114 --> 03:41:36.416
EVENT. FOR THE NEED TO X..

03:41:36.483 --> 03:41:38.318
GO AND EXTEND SUCH OF LIMITATION

03:41:38.385 --> 03:41:38.985
AS IT PERTAINS TO PROSECUTION OF

03:41:39.052 --> 03:41:39.552
OF PERPETRATORS OF DOMESTIC

03:41:39.619 --> 03:41:40.587
VIOLENCE.

03:41:40.654 --> 03:41:42.055
I THINK WE REALLY NEED TO SHIFT

03:41:42.122 --> 03:41:44.424
THE FOCS ON THE INTERPRETATION

03:41:44.491 --> 03:41:45.492
OF THIS LAW.

03:41:45.558 --> 03:41:46.393
FROM.

03:41:46.459 --> 03:41:47.794
PROSECUTION OF PERPETRATORS TO

03:41:47.861 --> 03:41:48.695
BEING A TOOL FOR CURRENT VICTIMS

03:41:48.762 --> 03:41:50.830
AND SURVIVORS OF INTIMATE

03:41:50.897 --> 03:41:52.165
PARTNER VIOLENCE IPV.

03:41:52.232 --> 03:41:54.034
I SHARE MY STORY BECAUSE I HOPE

03:41:54.100 --> 03:41:55.035
THAT I CAN SHOW THE IMPORTANCE

03:41:55.101 --> 03:41:57.337
OF THIS CHANGE NOT ONLY FOR ME.

03:41:57.404 --> 03:41:58.605
BUT FOR THE THOUSAND NAMELESS

03:41:58.672 --> 03:41:59.873
AND FACELESS WOMEN THAT ARE

03:41:59.939 --> 03:42:03.410
CURRENTLY FACING WHAT I FACE AT

03:42:03.476 --> 03:42:05.311
THE YOUNG AGE OF TWELVE CAN YOU

03:42:05.378 --> 03:42:05.979
IMAGINE ME AT TWELVE MY

03:42:06.046 --> 03:42:07.313

03:48:54.420 --> 03:48:55.455
SYSTEM.

03:48:55.521 --> 03:48:57.757
IN A STATEWIDE STUDIED MORE THAN

03:48:57.824 --> 03:49:00.660
30% OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CASES

03:49:00.726 --> 03:49:02.462
INVOLVING AGGRAVATED PHYSICAL

03:49:02.528 --> 03:49:05.331
ASSAULT WE'RE NOT PROSECUTED.

03:49:05.398 --> 03:49:07.100
OTHER RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT

03:49:07.166 --> 03:49:08.334
WHILE POLICE TEAM JUST A

03:49:08.401 --> 03:49:10.970
FRACTION OF SEXUAL ASSAULT CASES

03:49:11.037 --> 03:49:12.472
WORTHY OF INVESTIGATION.

03:49:12.538 --> 03:49:13.973
PROSECUTORS HAVE APPROACH

03:49:14.040 --> 03:49:16.476
SUSPICIOUSLY EVEN THOSE CASES

03:49:16.542 --> 03:49:18.077
THAT POLICE DEEMED TO HAVE THE

03:49:18.144 --> 03:49:22.615
STRONGEST EVIDENCE OF SEXUAL

03:49:22.682 --> 03:49:23.649
ASSAULT.

03:49:23.716 --> 03:49:24.450
EXTENDING THE STATUTE OF

03:49:24.517 --> 03:49:25.384
LIMITATIONS IN THESE CASES WILL

03:49:25.451 --> 03:49:27.487
NOT IMPROVE THESE OUTCOMES AND

03:49:27.553 --> 03:49:29.122
MAY SERVE ONLY TO FURTHER

03:49:29.188 --> 03:49:30.523
DISCOURAGE THE SWIFT AND

03:49:30.590 --> 03:49:32.458
EFFECTIVE.

03:49:32.525 --> 03:49:34.527
ENFORCEMENT OF THE LAW.

03:49:34.594 --> 03:49:36.262
AND MAY WEAKEN THE THREAT OF

03:49:36.329 --> 03:49:38.231
PROSECUTION FOR THOSE WHO DEMAND

03:49:38.297 --> 03:49:39.665
WHO COMMIT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

03:49:39.732 --> 03:49:41.634
CRIMES SO FOR ALL OF THESE

03:49:41.701 --> 03:49:44.103
REASONS WE EAT RESPECTFULLY

03:49:44.170 --> 03:49:46.105
OPPOSE THE BILL AND LESS AMENDED

03:49:46.172 --> 03:49:47.440
TO REMOVE THE EXTENSION OF THE

03:49:47.507 --> 03:49:59.552
STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS THANK YOU.

03:49:59.619 --> 03:50:00.386
ARE THERE OTHER WITNESSES IN

03:50:00.453 --> 03:50:03.923
OPPOSITION [inaudible]

03:50:03.990 --> 03:50:06.392
RIGHT [inaudible]

03:50:06.459 --> 03:50:09.295
GO AHEAD.

03:50:09.362 --> 03:50:10.563
FUNDAMENTAL REPRESENTING THE SAN

03:50:10.630 --> 03:50:11.731
FRANCISCO PUBLIC DEFENDER'S

03:50:11.797 --> 03:50:13.599
OFFICE IN OPPOSITION OKAY ANY

03:50:13.666 --> 03:50:16.736
OTHERS.

03:50:16.802 --> 03:50:18.237
ALL RIGHT -- BEFORE I CALL ON

03:50:18.304 --> 03:50:20.106
ANY COLLEAGUES -- I WANT TO

03:50:20.173 --> 03:50:22.074
SPEAK -- TO THIS BILL

03:50:22.141 --> 03:50:22.375
[inaudible]

03:50:22.441 --> 03:50:24.544
I'M.

03:50:24.610 --> 03:50:26.412
I APPRECIATE THE PUBLIC DEFENDER

03:50:26.479 --> 03:50:29.782
CITATION OF THE SUPREME COURT'S --

03:50:29.849 --> 03:50:30.816
EXPRESSION ON STATURE

03:50:30.883 --> 03:50:33.186
LIMITATIONS AND I APPRECIATE THE

03:50:33.252 --> 03:50:34.787
ACLU'S POINT OF VIEW.

03:50:34.854 --> 03:50:37.623
HOWEVER I THINK THAT.

03:50:37.690 --> 03:50:40.493
WHAT WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE?

03:50:40.560 --> 03:50:43.396
IS THE ABILITY FOR VICTIMS TO

03:50:43.462 --> 03:50:44.263
COME FORWARD.

03:50:44.330 --> 03:50:46.832
AND IF WE LOOK AT THE HISTORY

03:50:46.899 --> 03:50:48.801
FOR EXAMPLE AROUND RATE.

03:50:48.868 --> 03:50:50.736
WE ORIGINALLY HAD A STATUE OF

03:50:50.803 --> 03:50:52.738
LIMITATIONS SOMETIME AGO AT

03:50:52.805 --> 03:50:54.640
THREE YEARS.

03:50:54.707 --> 03:50:56.142
THEN LATER WAS TEN YEARS.

03:50:56.209 --> 03:50:57.977
AND NOW ONLY JUST I THINK IT WAS

03:50:58.044 --> 03:50:59.879
THREE YEARS AGO ANDERSON RELAVIS

03:50:59.946 --> 03:51:01.347
BILL.

03:51:01.414 --> 03:51:02.748
WE REMOVED THE STATUE

03:51:02.815 --> 03:51:04.417
LIMITATIONS ENTIRELY.

03:51:04.483 --> 03:51:06.419
NOW CLEARLY THERE HAS TO BE VERY

03:51:06.485 --> 03:51:09.255
CLEAR EVIDENCE BUT IT WAS

03:51:09.322 --> 03:51:13.326
RECOGNIZED THAT. FOR ANY NUMBER

03:51:13.392 --> 03:51:15.595
OF A WELL I WANT TO SEE ANY

03:51:15.661 --> 03:51:17.930
NUMBER LET'S BE LET'S JUST BE

03:51:17.997 --> 03:51:19.265
REALLY CLEAR AROUND.

03:51:19.332 --> 03:51:21.234
THE PREJUDICE TOWARDS VICTIMS OF

03:51:21.300 --> 03:51:23.035
RAPE COMING FORWARD FOR THEIR

03:51:23.102 --> 03:51:25.171
BEING BELIEVED AND FOR EVEN LAW

03:51:25.238 --> 03:51:28.407
ENFORCEMENT TAKING THEIR CRIME

03:51:28.474 --> 03:51:29.475
SERIOUSLY.

03:51:29.542 --> 03:51:31.844
ALL OF THOSE THINGS LED INTO.

03:51:31.911 --> 03:51:33.613
I BELIEVE THE LEGISLATURE WHILE

03:51:33.679 --> 03:51:36.282
I WAS NOT THERE AT THE TIME BUT

03:51:36.349 --> 03:51:36.916
I WOULD HAVE SUPPORTED IT HAD I

03:51:36.983 --> 03:51:38.050
BEEN HERE.

03:51:38.117 --> 03:51:39.619
WILLINGNESS TO LIFT THAT STATUE

03:51:39.685 --> 03:51:41.153
OF LIMITATIONS.

03:51:41.220 --> 03:51:43.956
THEN WHEN WE LOOK AT SEXUAL

03:51:44.023 --> 03:51:46.993
MOLESTATION OF CHILDREN. FOR FOR

03:51:47.059 --> 03:51:47.827
YEARS WE HAD A STATUE

03:51:47.893 --> 03:51:49.595
LIMITATIONS ON THAT NOT

03:51:49.662 --> 03:51:52.365
RECOGNIZING THAT. FOR MOST

03:51:52.431 --> 03:51:56.302
CHILDREN.

03:51:56.369 --> 03:51:58.638
THE VERY CIRCUMSTANCE THAT.

03:51:58.704 --> 03:52:01.841
THAT LED TO THEIR BEING ABLE TO

03:52:01.907 --> 03:52:04.110
BE SUBJECT TO THAT.

03:52:04.176 --> 03:52:04.477
ABUSE.

03:52:04.543 --> 03:52:05.211
WAS.

03:52:05.278 --> 03:52:07.847
WAS A CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE.

03:52:07.913 --> 03:52:10.182
THEY HAD NOT PERSONALLY AN

03:52:10.249 --> 03:52:13.219
INABILITY TO TELL BUT A SETTING

03:52:13.286 --> 03:52:15.288
FOR WHICH IT WAS EITHER POWERFUL

03:52:15.354 --> 03:52:17.156
INDIVIDUALS OR CIRCUMSTANCES

03:52:17.223 --> 03:52:18.190
WHERE.

03:52:18.257 --> 03:52:19.592
THEY WERE THREATENED OR THEY

03:52:19.659 --> 03:52:21.460
KNEW THEY COULD NOT TELL AND SO

03:52:21.527 --> 03:52:23.062
THAT'S IT WAS INTERNALIZED THAT

03:52:23.129 --> 03:52:25.665
THEY THEMSELVES EITHER ASKED FOR

03:52:25.731 --> 03:52:25.831
IT.

03:52:25.898 --> 03:52:26.766
OR DESERVED IT.

03:52:26.832 --> 03:52:30.303
AND WHAT WE NOW KNOW IS THAT FOR

03:52:30.369 --> 03:52:32.571
PEOPLE IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES IT

03:52:32.638 --> 03:52:35.741
TAKES YEARS FOR THEM TO FINALLY.

03:52:35.808 --> 03:52:37.443
ACCEPT.

03:52:37.510 --> 03:52:39.378
THAT THEY THEMSELVES WERE THE

03:52:39.445 --> 03:52:42.348
VICTIMS OF EAST OF A CRIME.

03:52:42.415 --> 03:52:43.849
AND THEN TO BE ABLE TO REPORT

03:52:43.916 --> 03:52:45.551
AND SO WE'VE NOW LIFTED THAT

03:52:45.618 --> 03:52:46.886
STATUE REVOCATIONS UP TO A

03:52:46.952 --> 03:52:49.622
PERSON TO BEING UP TO FORTY

03:52:49.689 --> 03:52:50.289
YEARS OLD.

03:52:50.356 --> 03:52:55.328
SO WE MADE MANY CHANGES THAT.

03:52:55.394 --> 03:52:57.163
FIVE BY A STRICT READING OF THE

03:52:57.229 --> 03:52:58.597
COURT'S OPINION ONE COULD SAY

03:52:58.664 --> 03:53:00.199
WAS VERY CONTRARY AND YET I

03:53:00.266 --> 03:53:02.335
THINK WE ALWAYS HAVE TO WEIGH.

03:53:02.401 --> 03:53:03.903
THE CIRCUMSTANCE WERE MAKING A

03:53:03.969 --> 03:53:05.838
CHANGE.

03:53:05.905 --> 03:53:08.774
AND WHEN WE LOOK AT DOMESTIC

03:53:08.841 --> 03:53:11.110
PARTNER ABUSE.

03:53:11.177 --> 03:53:13.713
IT TO MY PARTNER VIOLENCE INNER

03:53:13.779 --> 03:53:15.147
INTIMATE PARTNER ABUSE.

03:53:15.214 --> 03:53:17.183
WHILE IT IS NOT A 100% THE

03:53:17.249 --> 03:53:18.351
CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE THE

03:53:18.417 --> 03:53:20.720
INDIVIDUAL WHO IS THE ABUSER

03:53:20.786 --> 03:53:22.588
GROOMS THE PARTNER.

03:53:22.655 --> 03:53:24.857
IS VERY COMMON. TO THE POINT

03:53:24.924 --> 03:53:26.359
WHERE.

03:53:26.425 --> 03:53:28.060
EITHER BECAUSE OF THEIR GROOMING

03:53:28.127 --> 03:53:29.295
OR BECAUSE OF THE PARTNERS

03:53:29.362 --> 03:53:30.896
DEPENDENCE.

03:53:30.963 --> 03:53:33.799
ON THE ABUSER EITHER FINANCIAL

03:53:33.866 --> 03:53:34.500
OR OTHERWISE.

03:53:34.567 --> 03:53:37.937
OR ANY NUMBER OF OTHER FACTORS.

03:53:38.003 --> 03:53:40.172
IT IN WE KNOW INDEPENDENT OF

03:53:40.239 --> 03:53:40.740
BEING ABLE TO REPORT IT IS A

03:53:40.806 --> 03:53:41.907
CRIME.

03:53:41.974 --> 03:53:43.976
IT IS VERY COMMON THAT PEOPLE IN

03:53:44.043 --> 03:53:45.745
THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES STAY IN THEM

03:53:45.811 --> 03:53:47.446
FOR A LONG TIME.

03:53:47.513 --> 03:53:49.615
THAT IS WELL DOCUMENTED.

03:53:49.682 --> 03:53:51.984
AND NOT BECAUSE THEY WANT THE

03:53:52.051 --> 03:53:54.487
ABUSE BUT BECAUSE THEY FEEL

03:53:54.553 --> 03:53:56.622
POWERLESS TO GET OUT OF IT.

03:53:56.689 --> 03:53:57.857
AND EVEN WHEN THEY GET OUT OF IT

03:53:57.923 --> 03:53:59.392
THEY STILL FEEL POWERLESS TO

03:53:59.458 --> 03:54:01.560
REPORT.

03:54:01.627 --> 03:54:03.763
OR TO ACT ON IT THEY STILL FEEL

03:54:03.829 --> 03:54:04.997
THAT EITHER IT WAS THEIR FAULT.

03:54:05.064 --> 03:54:06.465
OR THAT THE CONSEQUENCES FOR THE

03:54:06.532 --> 03:54:08.200
SHAME.

03:54:08.267 --> 03:54:11.470
SO I THINK ALL OF THAT LENDS

03:54:11.537 --> 03:54:13.739
ITSELF TO A LEGITIMACY FOR OUR

03:54:13.806 --> 03:54:15.875
LIFTING A THREE YEAR STATUTE OF

03:54:15.941 --> 03:54:16.776
LIMITATIONS.

03:54:16.842 --> 03:54:18.511
NOW THE BILL HAD RECOMMENDED

03:54:18.577 --> 03:54:19.545
TWENTY YEARS.

03:54:19.612 --> 03:54:21.580
I PERSONALLY WOULD BE

03:54:21.647 --> 03:54:23.182
COMFORTABLE WITH THAT TWENTY

03:54:23.249 --> 03:54:23.382
YEARS.

03:54:23.449 --> 03:54:31.590
BUT BECAUSE OF THE BALANCING OF

03:54:31.657 --> 03:54:33.626
TRYING TO WAY.

03:54:33.692 --> 03:54:36.762
ON THE VALIDITY OF STATUTE OF

03:54:36.829 --> 03:54:38.764
LIMITATIONS.

03:54:38.831 --> 03:54:41.967
I FELT IT WAS APPROPRIATE.

03:54:42.034 --> 03:54:44.136
TO THIS FIRST STAGE BRING IT TO

03:54:44.203 --> 03:54:46.172
TEN YEARS AND I APPRECIATE THAT

03:54:46.238 --> 03:54:47.640
THE AUTHOR WAS WILLING.

03:54:47.706 --> 03:54:49.442
AND I HOPE THAT THE BILL AS IT

03:54:49.508 --> 03:54:50.643
MOVES FORWARD IF IT MOVES

03:54:50.709 --> 03:54:52.745
FORWARD TODAY CAN BE RETAINED AT

03:54:52.812 --> 03:54:55.281
THAT AND ISN'T SHRUNK FURTHER.

03:54:55.347 --> 03:54:57.283
BUT OF COURSE WE KNOW SOMETIMES

03:54:57.349 --> 03:54:58.751
THESE THINGS HAPPEN AND WE MAY

03:54:58.818 --> 03:55:00.252
HAVE TO ENTERTAIN THIS AGAIN BUT

03:55:00.319 --> 03:55:02.721
IF WE CERTAINLY LOOK AT THE

03:55:02.788 --> 03:55:04.023
HISTORY.

03:55:04.089 --> 03:55:05.691
OF SIMILAR.

03:55:05.758 --> 03:55:07.493
TYPES OF CRIMES IN THE STATE'S

03:55:07.560 --> 03:55:08.894
HISTORY OF STATUTE OF

03:55:08.961 --> 03:55:10.329
LIMITATIONS AROUND THOSE.

03:55:10.396 --> 03:55:11.964
SOMETIMES WE HAVE.

03:55:12.031 --> 03:55:14.667
TO HAVE SOME EXPERIENCE BEFORE

03:55:14.733 --> 03:55:15.568
WE CAN.

03:55:15.634 --> 03:55:17.069
POTENTIALLY GET TO THE POINT

03:55:17.136 --> 03:55:18.370
WHERE.

03:55:18.437 --> 03:55:20.473
WE BALANCE IT EXACTLY RIGHT.

03:55:20.539 --> 03:55:21.740
BUT I THINK THAT THIS IS A

03:55:21.807 --> 03:55:23.909
APPROPRIATING GOOD FIRST STEP.

03:55:23.976 --> 03:55:27.346
BECAUSE IT RECOGNIZES THAT.

03:55:27.413 --> 03:55:29.849
PERSONS WHO ARE SUBJECT TO

03:55:29.915 --> 03:55:31.750
INTIMATE PARTNER ABUSE ARE IN

03:55:31.817 --> 03:55:34.420
VERY VULNERABLE CIRCUMSTANCES.

03:55:34.487 --> 03:55:38.858
AND ALL OF THOSE VULNERABILITIES.

03:55:38.924 --> 03:55:40.326
CONTRIBUTE TO THEIR BOTH

03:55:40.392 --> 03:55:41.794
INABILITY TO GET OUT OF THAT

03:55:41.861 --> 03:55:43.128
ABUSIVE SITUATION AND THEN TO

03:55:43.195 --> 03:55:44.797
REPORT IT.

03:55:44.864 --> 03:55:46.532
AND I WANT TO CREATE.

03:55:46.599 --> 03:55:50.636
BETTER JUSTICE SYSTEM OR PEOPLE

03:55:50.703 --> 03:55:52.571
IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES AND GIVE

03:55:52.638 --> 03:55:54.673
THEM THE TIME TO HEAL.

03:55:54.740 --> 03:55:55.708
SO THAT THEY CAN THEN COME

03:55:55.774 --> 03:55:57.176
FORWARD.

03:55:57.243 --> 03:55:59.411
AND THAT WE DO NOT HAVE A LEGAL

03:55:59.478 --> 03:56:02.414
BARRIER THAT PREVENTS THEIR

03:56:02.481 --> 03:56:04.750
PERPETRATOR FROM.

03:56:04.817 --> 03:56:06.452
FROM THAT HAVING TO GO BEFORE

03:56:06.519 --> 03:56:07.720
JUSTICE.

03:56:07.786 --> 03:56:09.655
SO I APPRECIATE THE BILL AND AS

03:56:09.722 --> 03:56:11.123
YOU'VE HEARD ME EXPRESS MY

03:56:11.190 --> 03:56:13.325
OPINION ON IT I WILL BE

03:56:13.392 --> 03:56:15.327
RECOMMENDING TO THE CANADIAN AYE

03:56:15.394 --> 03:56:15.528
VOTE.

03:56:15.594 --> 03:56:20.866
AND SENATOR WIENER GO AHEAD.

ENSURE THAT JURIES ARE NOT

04:01:47.459 --> 04:01:49.261
BIASED IN THAT THEY DELIBERATE

04:01:49.328 --> 04:01:51.964
FAIRLY -- SB FIVE SIXTEENS

04:01:52.030 --> 04:01:54.933
PURPOSE IS TO ASSIST THAT

04:01:55.000 --> 04:01:56.101
OBJECTIVE.

04:01:56.168 --> 04:01:58.303
EVIDENCE OF A CRIME PRESENTED

04:01:58.370 --> 04:02:01.306
DURING TRIAL IS THE BASIS ON HOW

04:02:01.373 --> 04:02:04.009
JURIES ARE SUPPOSED TO DECIDE

04:02:04.076 --> 04:02:06.011
GUILT OR INNOCENCE.

04:02:06.078 --> 04:02:07.412
CURRENT LAW.

04:02:07.479 --> 04:02:09.181
GIVES THE COURT'S DISCRETION TO

04:02:09.248 --> 04:02:11.717
EXCLUDE EVIDENCE IF IT CREATES

04:02:11.783 --> 04:02:14.152
UNDUE PREJUDICE CONFUSES THE

04:02:14.219 --> 04:02:16.255
ISSUES OR MISLEAD THE JURY.

04:02:16.321 --> 04:02:19.191
HOWEVER JUDGES RARELY ACT TO

04:02:19.258 --> 04:02:21.593
EXCLUDE EVIDENCE PARTICULARLY

04:02:21.660 --> 04:02:23.161
GANG EVIDENCE.

04:02:23.228 --> 04:02:25.130
THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME CURT

04:02:25.197 --> 04:02:26.932
ITSELF WEIGHED IN STATING AND I

04:02:26.999 --> 04:02:27.532
QUOTE.

04:02:27.599 --> 04:02:29.701
GANG EVIDENCE EVEN AS IT RELATES

04:02:29.768 --> 04:02:31.003
TO THE DEFENDANT MAYBE SO

04:02:31.069 --> 04:02:33.705
EXTRAORDINARILY PREJUDICIAL AND

04:02:33.772 --> 04:02:35.641
IF SO LITTLE REVEL INSTIGATE ALT

04:02:35.707 --> 04:02:37.009
THAT IT THREATENS TO SWAY THE

04:02:37.075 --> 04:02:39.278
JURY TO CONVICT REGARDLESS OF

04:02:39.344 --> 04:02:41.647
THE DEFENDANTS ACTUAL GUILT.

04:02:41.713 --> 04:02:44.216
SO WHAT SB FIVE SIXTEEN DOES IS

04:02:44.283 --> 04:02:46.118
ADDRESSES THIS PREJUDICIAL

04:02:46.184 --> 04:02:48.420
EVIDENCE BY REQUIRING A

04:02:48.487 --> 04:02:50.856

04:02:59.464 --> 04:03:00.132
GANG.

04:03:00.198 --> 04:03:02.968
AND THEN SECONDARILY THE JURY

04:03:03.035 --> 04:03:04.269
WOULD DETERMINE.

04:03:04.336 --> 04:03:06.538
IF THE DEFENDANT IS GUILTY OF A

04:03:06.605 --> 04:03:10.008

04:03:30.729 --> 04:03:31.430
COUNCIL DELAY.

04:03:31.496 --> 04:03:32.664
MY PRIMARY AREA OF RESEARCH IS

04:03:32.731 --> 04:03:34.599
REALLY AN EYEWITNESS MEMORY BUT

04:03:34.666 --> 04:03:36.401
WHEN I STARTED -- WAS WORKING ON

04:03:36.468 --> 04:03:38.403
A LOT OF CASES IN WHICH I FOUND

04:03:38.470 --> 04:03:40.138
THAT THE EVIDENCE WAS REALLY

04:03:40.205 --> 04:03:41.139
WEAK.

04:03:41.206 --> 04:03:43.175
BUT YET THE PROSECUTORS USED THE

04:03:43.241 --> 04:03:44.576
DISCRETION OF BRINGING IN GANG

04:03:44.643 --> 04:03:45.844
TESTIMONY AND HAVING LENGTHY

04:03:45.911 --> 04:03:47.446
TESTIMONY FROM A GANG EXPERT

04:03:47.512 --> 04:03:48.313

COMMITTED BY THE GROUP.

04:03:51.116 --> 04:03:53.118
AND THEN FOR SOME REASON THEY

04:03:53.185 --> 04:03:54.386
WERE SECURING GUILTY VERDICTS

04:03:54.453 --> 04:03:55.988
AND I WAS SURPRISED IN THESE

04:03:56.054 --> 04:03:57.055
PARTICULAR CASES.

04:03:57.122 --> 04:03:59.558
NOW IN SOME CASES THE DEFENDANT

04:03:59.624 --> 04:04:01.193
WASN'T IN A METAGAME MEMBER.

04:04:01.259 --> 04:04:02.661
BUT IN OTHER CASES WE'RE TALKING

04:04:02.728 --> 04:04:04.162
ABOUT A KID WITH A SINGLE F. I.

04:04:04.229 --> 04:04:05.897
KERR TO FIELD IDENTIFICATION

04:04:05.964 --> 04:04:06.698
CARD BECAUSE HE'S HANGING OUT

04:04:06.765 --> 04:04:07.566
WITH SOME.

04:04:07.632 --> 04:04:09.601
FRIENDS WHO GOT IN TROUBLE AND

04:04:09.668 --> 04:04:10.769
PLAYED BASKETBALL WITH THEM AND

04:04:10.836 --> 04:04:12.270
GOT STOPPED BY THE POLICE AT

04:04:12.337 --> 04:04:13.972
SOME POINT IN IN INDEED.

04:04:14.039 --> 04:04:16.074
THAT CARD LED TO HIM SUSPICION

04:04:16.141 --> 04:04:17.809
OF HIS CRIMINAL INVOLVEMENT IN

04:04:17.876 --> 04:04:19.311
OTHER CASES IT WAS FOLKSWHO'VE

04:04:19.378 --> 04:04:20.645
BEEN TRYING TO GET OUT OF THIS

04:04:20.712 --> 04:04:21.313
LIFE AND PULL THEIR LIVES

04:04:21.380 --> 04:04:22.481
TOGETHER.

04:04:22.547 --> 04:04:23.949
BUT THEY HAD A HISTORY OF BEING

04:04:24.016 --> 04:04:24.950
KNUCKLE HEADS WHEN THEY WERE

04:04:25.017 --> 04:04:28.453
KIDS AND GETTING INVOLVED IN

04:04:28.520 --> 04:04:29.855
TROUBLE.

04:04:29.921 --> 04:04:33.191
SO I WAS CONCERNED THAT PERHAPS

04:04:33.258 --> 04:04:33.392
THAT.

04:04:33.458 --> 04:04:33.759
ALTHOUGH THIS.

04:04:33.825 --> 04:04:35.827
THIS TESTIMONY WAS IN. TO SHOW

04:04:35.894 --> 04:04:36.595
MOTIVE IT HAD THE UNINTENDED

04:04:36.661 --> 04:04:38.663
CONSEQUENCES OF BASICALLY

04:04:38.730 --> 04:04:40.499
INFERRING THAT THE DEFENDANT WAS

04:04:40.565 --> 04:04:41.933
ACTUALLY PARTICIPATING IN THE

04:04:42.000 --> 04:04:45.337
AXE BEING DESCRIBED BY THE GANG

04:04:45.404 --> 04:04:46.671
EXPERT WITH GANGS PARTICIPATING.

04:04:46.738 --> 04:04:47.639
SO WE DID SOME RESEARCH.

04:04:47.706 --> 04:04:49.141
AND IN OUR FIRST STUDY PUBLISHED

04:04:49.207 --> 04:04:51.343
IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN WE

04:04:51.410 --> 04:04:52.944
SIMPLY HAD TO SIMULATE TRIAL

04:04:53.011 --> 04:04:54.212
VIDEOTAPE TRIAL THE FOLKS WATCH

04:04:54.279 --> 04:04:55.881
WHERE THERE WAS EITHER NO

04:04:55.947 --> 04:04:56.581
MENTION OF GANG.

04:04:56.648 --> 04:04:58.083
OR THE INVESTIGATING OFFICER

04:04:58.150 --> 04:04:59.684
SAID THE KID WAS HANGING OUT

04:04:59.751 --> 04:05:00.786
WITH GANG MEMBERS BEFORE THE

04:05:00.852 --> 04:05:02.721
CRIME OR IF THEY WERE SELF

04:05:02.788 --> 04:05:03.688
METAGAME MEMBER.

04:05:03.755 --> 04:05:04.990
AND INDEED IN THIS FIRST

04:05:05.057 --> 04:05:07.459
EXPERIMENT WE FOUND THAT JUST

04:05:07.526 --> 04:05:09.461
MENTIONING GANG LED TO INCREASE

04:05:09.528 --> 04:05:10.829
GUILTY VERDICTS.

04:05:10.896 --> 04:05:11.663
SO WE REDID IT.

04:05:11.730 --> 04:05:13.398
IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN WITH

04:05:13.465 --> 04:05:14.866
ANOTHER EXPERIMENT WHERE WE

04:05:14.933 --> 04:05:15.467
VIDEOTAPE THE TRIAL BUT THIS

04:05:15.534 --> 04:05:17.169
TIME WE ACTUALLY HAD GANG

04:05:17.235 --> 04:05:19.071
TESTIMONY IN THE AREA A GETTING

04:05:19.137 --> 04:05:19.671
US WHERE TO DOES IT FREQUENTLY

04:05:19.738 --> 04:05:22.941
FOR THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE DOING

04:05:23.008 --> 04:05:24.543
ITS PART OF THE TRIAL.

04:05:24.609 --> 04:05:26.244
CLEARLY REASONABLE THAT WAS

04:05:26.311 --> 04:05:27.679
CLEARLY ESTABLISHED.

04:05:27.746 --> 04:05:28.713
AS EVIDENCED BY THE FACT THAT

04:05:28.780 --> 04:05:30.348
WHEN NO GAME WAS MENTIONED IN

04:05:30.415 --> 04:05:32.417
THIS TRIAL AFTER DELIBERATIONS

04:05:32.484 --> 04:05:34.820
THERE WERE ZERO GUILTY VERDICTS.

04:05:34.886 --> 04:05:37.789
HOWEVER WHEN THE GANG EXPERT AND

04:05:37.856 --> 04:05:38.356
THE GANG TEST WHEN HE WAS

04:05:38.423 --> 04:05:41.259
ADMITTED WE GOT 10% GUILTY.

04:05:41.326 --> 04:05:42.094
GUILTY VERDICTS AND WE ARE

04:05:42.160 --> 04:05:43.728
WANTING HOW'S THIS POSSIBLE SO

04:05:43.795 --> 04:05:45.363
WE RE DID IT AGAIN.

04:05:45.430 --> 04:05:47.966
AND THIS TIME WE MADE IT IT'S

04:05:48.033 --> 04:05:48.834
MORE SERIOUS CRIME.

04:05:48.900 --> 04:05:49.968
FIGHT OVER A GIRL THAT RESULT IN

04:05:50.035 --> 04:05:51.470
A SHOOTING AND A CHILD WAS

04:05:51.536 --> 04:05:53.205
KILLED WITH A STRAY BULLET.

04:05:53.271 --> 04:05:54.739
AND AGAIN.

04:05:54.806 --> 04:05:56.575
WE FOUND THE SAME THING WHEN THE

04:05:56.641 --> 04:05:58.643
GANG TESTIMONY WAS ADMITTED WE

04:05:58.710 --> 04:06:02.147
HAD 20% GUILTY VERDICTS AND WHEN

04:06:02.214 --> 04:06:03.348
NO GANG TESTIMONY WAS OMITTED.

04:06:03.415 --> 04:06:07.018
ONE PERSON OUT OF ABOUT TWO

04:06:07.085 --> 04:06:07.452
HUNDRED FIFTY AFTER

04:06:07.519 --> 04:06:09.154
DELIBERATIONS VOTED GUILTY.

04:06:09.221 --> 04:06:10.722
AND WE HAVE THIS ON FINDING AND

04:06:10.789 --> 04:06:12.791
WE FOUND THAT ACROSS THE STUDIES

04:06:12.858 --> 04:06:14.159
WHEN THE GANG EVIDENCE WAS

04:06:14.226 --> 04:06:15.260
ADMITTED.

04:06:15.327 --> 04:06:16.161
WE FOUND THAT DURING

04:06:16.228 --> 04:06:17.629
DELIBERATIONS PEOPLE WERE

04:06:17.696 --> 04:06:19.564
DISCUSSING THAT ONE OF THE

04:06:19.631 --> 04:06:20.799
REASONS THEY WANT TO VOTE GUILTY

04:06:20.866 --> 04:06:24.503
WAS EVIDENCE OF THE DEFENDANT'S

04:06:24.569 --> 04:06:25.504
PRIOR CRIMINAL CONDUCT.

04:06:25.570 --> 04:06:27.606
BUT NO SUCH EVIDENCE WAS EVER

04:06:27.672 --> 04:06:28.640
ADMITTED.

04:06:28.707 --> 04:06:29.808
WHEN WE ARE WANTING WHAT IS THE

04:06:29.875 --> 04:06:31.743
ORIGIN OF THIS FALSE MEMORY SO

04:06:31.810 --> 04:06:33.078
WE DID ANOTHER COUPLE OF STUDIES

04:06:33.145 --> 04:06:35.180
MORE RECENTLY WHERE WE DID THE

04:06:35.247 --> 04:06:37.382
EXACT SAME PROCEDURES BUT AFTER

04:06:37.449 --> 04:06:39.184
DELIBERATIONS WE ASK THEM?

04:06:39.251 --> 04:06:40.018
ABOUT THEIR MEMORY FOR THE

04:06:40.085 --> 04:06:41.820
EVIDENCE AND WE SPECIFICALLY

04:06:41.887 --> 04:06:42.954
ASKED.

04:06:43.021 --> 04:06:44.256
DO YOU REMEMBER EVIDENCE BEING

04:06:44.322 --> 04:06:46.458
PRESENTED A PREVIOUS CRIMINAL

04:06:46.525 --> 04:06:48.360
CONDUCT AND DO YOU REMEMBER

04:06:48.426 --> 04:06:51.263
EVIDENCE OF PREVIOUS CONVICTIONS.

04:06:51.329 --> 04:06:53.131
FOR SIMILAR CRIMES VERY

04:06:53.198 --> 04:06:55.400
PREJUDICIAL EVIDENCE O TIGHTLY

04:06:55.467 --> 04:06:56.568
CONTROLLED BY THE COURT.

04:06:56.635 --> 04:06:58.637
AND INDEED WE FOUND THAT IN THE

04:06:58.703 --> 04:06:59.704
GANG CONDITION IT WAS NOT

04:06:59.771 --> 04:07:02.774
UNCOMMON FOR PEOPLE TO REPORT

04:07:02.841 --> 04:07:04.709
THESE FALSE MEMORIES.

04:07:04.776 --> 04:07:06.044
NOW WHY.

04:07:06.111 --> 04:07:07.779
WELL BASICALLY THERE'S THE

04:07:07.846 --> 04:07:09.414
STRONG INFERENCE OF THE GANG

04:07:09.481 --> 04:07:11.416
TESTIMONY THAT IF THE GANG IS

04:07:11.483 --> 04:07:12.184
PARTICIPATING THESE CRIMINAL

04:07:12.250 --> 04:07:14.152
ACTIVITIES AND THIS PERSON IS A

04:07:14.219 --> 04:07:14.786
MEMBER OF THE GANG THEN THEY

04:07:14.853 --> 04:07:15.587
MUST BE.

04:07:15.654 --> 04:07:17.322
SO IT COULD BE JUST AN INFERENCE

04:07:17.389 --> 04:07:18.323
AND PEOPLE WERE JUST HAVING

04:07:18.390 --> 04:07:19.424
TROUBLE WITH THAT AND IN

04:07:19.491 --> 04:07:22.093
MISTAKENLY UNDERSTANDING WHAT

04:07:22.160 --> 04:07:23.495
THE WHAT THE EVIDENCE WAS.

04:07:23.562 --> 04:07:25.931
HOWEVER THIS COULD NOT EXPLAIN

04:07:25.997 --> 04:07:28.133
THE OTHER FINDING OF WHY PEOPLE

04:07:28.200 --> 04:07:29.834
WOULD FALSELY RECALL HEARING

04:07:29.901 --> 04:07:32.504
EVIDENCE OF PREVIOUS CONVICTIONS

04:07:32.571 --> 04:07:33.872
FOR SIMILAR CRIMES.

04:07:33.939 --> 04:07:35.373
THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE THIS

04:07:35.440 --> 04:07:37.909
WAS NEVER EVEN INFERRED IN THE

04:07:37.976 --> 04:07:39.177
TESTIMONY.

04:07:39.244 --> 04:07:40.779
ESSENTIALLY OUR PROPOSAL -- OUR

04:07:40.845 --> 04:07:42.314
THEORY ON THIS BECAUSE THIS IS

04:07:42.380 --> 04:07:44.082
REPEATED NOW FOR SEVERAL

04:07:44.149 --> 04:07:45.417
EXPERIMENTS.

04:07:45.483 --> 04:07:46.351
IS THAT.

04:07:46.418 --> 04:07:48.019
IT'S HARD TO ORGANIZE ALL THIS

04:07:48.086 --> 04:07:49.454
INFORMATION FROM A TRIAL.

04:07:49.521 --> 04:07:50.755
THE FACT IS YOU'RE ASKING PEOPE

04:07:50.822 --> 04:07:52.891
TO DO A LOT YOU'RE ASKING JURORS

04:07:52.958 --> 04:07:53.758
TO ORGANIZE HUGE AMOUNTS OF

04:07:53.825 --> 04:07:55.393
EVIDENCE IN THIS CASE IT WAS

04:07:55.460 --> 04:07:56.861
ONLY AN HOUR LONG TO SIMULATED

04:07:56.928 --> 04:07:57.495
TRIAL.

04:07:57.562 --> 04:07:59.531
AND TAPE MANY TRIALS LAST DAYS

04:07:59.598 --> 04:08:00.398
OR WEEKS.

04:08:00.465 --> 04:08:02.634
AND INDEED PEOPLE WILL CONFLATE

04:08:02.701 --> 04:08:04.469
SOME OF THE EVIDENCE OF THEIR

04:08:04.536 --> 04:08:05.303
HEARING.

04:08:05.370 --> 04:08:06.905
LEADING TO THESE MISTAKEN

04:08:06.972 --> 04:08:08.540
PROPOSITIONS SO WITH OUR DATA

04:08:08.607 --> 04:08:11.276
SENSUALLY SHOW IS IT NOT ONLY

04:08:11.343 --> 04:08:13.545
THIS IS THE INFERENCE OF THE

04:08:13.612 --> 04:08:14.112
GANG MEMBERSHIP.

04:08:14.179 --> 04:08:15.480
BIAS FOLKS AGAINST THE

04:08:15.547 --> 04:08:17.315
INDIVIDUAL WHICH IS I THINK

04:08:17.382 --> 04:08:18.583
COMMONSENSE.

04:08:18.650 --> 04:08:20.285
BUT ALSO IT APPEARS TO AFFECT

04:08:20.352 --> 04:08:22.387
PEOPLE'S MEMORY FOR THE EVIDENCE

04:08:22.454 --> 04:08:27.392
WHERE THEY ACTUALLY START TO

04:08:27.459 --> 04:08:28.994
BELIEVE THAT THEIR HEARING.

04:08:29.060 --> 04:08:30.595
TESTIMONY EXPERT DESCRIBING THE

04:08:30.662 --> 04:08:31.663
PERSON AS COMMITTING CRIMINAL

04:08:31.730 --> 04:08:32.397
ACTS.

04:08:32.464 --> 04:08:34.132
EVEN HAVING CONVICTIONS FOR

04:08:34.199 --> 04:08:39.771
SIMILAR CRIMES.

04:08:39.838 --> 04:08:40.972
GOOD AFTERNOON I'M APRIL VANDYKE

04:08:41.039 --> 04:08:42.807
CAM OF DEPUTY PUBLIC DEFENDER IN

04:08:42.874 --> 04:08:46.244
SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY I'M SB FIVE

04:08:46.311 --> 04:08:48.747
SIXTEEN IT WILL FIX THESE ISSUES --

04:08:48.813 --> 04:08:50.715
AS ILLUSTRATED BY DOCTOR EISEN'S

04:08:50.782 --> 04:08:54.119
RESEARCH -- SB FIVE SIXTEEN WILL

04:08:54.185 --> 04:08:56.554
RESTORE DUE PROCESS AND ENSURE A

04:08:56.621 --> 04:08:58.189
FAIR TRIAL PROCEDURES WHEN GANG

04:08:58.256 --> 04:08:59.924
ENHANCEMENTS AND OFFENSES ARE

04:08:59.991 --> 04:09:01.660
CHARGE.

04:09:01.726 --> 04:09:05.830
THIS BILL WOULD MERELY SEPARATE

04:09:05.897 --> 04:09:09.000
THE TWO I TWO SETS OF EVIDENCE

04:09:09.067 --> 04:09:10.702
ONE OF THE ACTUAL CHECK.

04:09:10.769 --> 04:09:12.570
CRIME THAT IS CHARGED THERE WILL

04:09:12.637 --> 04:09:14.339
BE A DETERMINATION OF WHETHER OR

04:09:14.406 --> 04:09:16.241
NOT THAT INDIVIDUAL IS GUILTY OF

04:09:16.308 --> 04:09:17.575
THE ACTUAL.

04:09:17.642 --> 04:09:19.878
CRIME CHARGED BEFORE ANY

04:09:19.944 --> 04:09:23.348
EVIDENCE OF GANG AFFILIATION OR

04:09:23.415 --> 04:09:25.250
CONTACTS IS PRESENTED TO THE

04:09:25.317 --> 04:09:26.217
JURY.

04:09:26.284 --> 04:09:28.386
WE ALREADY HAVE PROCEDURES LIKE

04:09:28.453 --> 04:09:31.056
THIS IN COURT ROOMS TODAY.

04:09:31.122 --> 04:09:33.024
SOMEONE FOR EXAMPLE WHO IS

04:09:33.091 --> 04:09:34.492
CHARGED WITH A PRIOR STRIKE

04:09:34.559 --> 04:09:36.795
CONVICTION COURTS REGULARLY

04:09:36.861 --> 04:09:39.597
BIFURCATE THIS EVIDENCE FIRST

04:09:39.664 --> 04:09:41.433
THEY DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT

04:09:41.499 --> 04:09:42.934
THE PERSON IS CONVICTED.

04:09:43.001 --> 04:09:45.937
ARE GUILTY EXCUSE ME OF AT THE

04:09:46.004 --> 04:09:48.373
UNDERLYING OFFENSE AND THEN THE

04:09:48.440 --> 04:09:50.408
JURY IS TO DETERMINE THE PRIOR

04:09:50.475 --> 04:09:54.946
CONVICTION -- GANG EVIDENCE IS

04:09:55.013 --> 04:09:58.350
SO HIGHLY INFLAMMATORY AND

04:09:58.416 --> 04:09:59.484
PREJUDICIAL.

04:09:59.551 --> 04:10:02.287
EVEN UTTERING THE WORD GANG TO A

04:10:02.354 --> 04:10:05.557
JURY CREATES A BIAS IN THE MIND

04:10:05.623 --> 04:10:09.661
OF THE JURORS. FOR EXAMPLE IN A

04:10:09.728 --> 04:10:12.263
RECENT TRIAL -- THE GANG EXPERT

04:10:12.330 --> 04:10:13.298
TESTIFIED.

04:10:13.365 --> 04:10:16.101
THE COURT HAD TO TAKE A BREAK.

04:10:16.167 --> 04:10:19.237
BECAUSE THE A JUROR HAD A PANIC

04:10:19.304 --> 04:10:19.637
ATTACK.

04:10:19.704 --> 04:10:22.340
AND THIS EXPERT WHO TESTIFIED

04:10:22.407 --> 04:10:24.142
NOT TO ANY ACTS THAT THIS

04:10:24.209 --> 04:10:26.244
INDIVIDUAL WHO IS ON TRIAL HAD

04:10:26.311 --> 04:10:26.911
DONE.

04:10:26.978 --> 04:10:29.614
BUT TO ACTS OF OTHER PEOPLE HAD

04:10:29.681 --> 04:10:33.084
DONE YEARS AND YEARS PRIOR.

04:10:33.151 --> 04:10:34.486
EVEN ACTS OF THIS.

04:10:34.552 --> 04:10:36.955
OF OTHER PEOPLE WHO HAD

04:10:37.021 --> 04:10:39.324

THEN TO IS.

04:16:27.538 --> 04:16:30.174
WHAT HERE -- IN TWO THOUSAND

04:16:30.241 --> 04:16:31.042
FIVE THERE WAS A GENTLEMAN FROM

04:16:31.109 --> 04:16:32.744
SACRAMENTO TRAVELING -- FROM A

04:16:32.810 --> 04:16:33.745
BACHELOR PARTY THROUGH

04:16:33.811 --> 04:16:35.713

04:16:35.780 --> 04:16:36.547
BAKERSFIELD.

04:16:36.614 --> 04:16:38.816
IT WAS OVER RUN BY GANGS AND

04:16:38.883 --> 04:16:39.484
WHAT THIS GENTLEMAN DIDN'T

04:16:39.550 --> 04:16:42.086
REALIZE IS THAT HE WAS WEARING

04:16:42.153 --> 04:16:44.856
AT SHIRT THAT WAS THE COLOR.

04:16:44.922 --> 04:16:46.224
OF A RIVAL.

04:16:46.290 --> 04:16:49.861
GANG SET IN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD --

04:16:49.927 --> 04:16:52.196
AND HE SIGHED CRIP MEMBER MEMBER

04:16:52.263 --> 04:16:53.731
NAMED TED BLACK MEN APPROACHED

04:16:53.798 --> 04:16:54.465
THE CAR IN WHICH SHE WAS

04:16:54.532 --> 04:16:55.967
SLEEPING MOTHER GASSING UP ON

04:16:56.033 --> 04:16:57.635

04:16:57.702 --> 04:16:59.370
SAID I SEE YOU.

04:16:59.437 --> 04:17:01.339
AND SHOT HIM AND KILLED HIM AND

04:17:01.405 --> 04:17:02.874
THEN SHOT SOMEBODY ELSE IN THE

04:17:02.940 --> 04:17:04.675
CAR BECAUSE HE WAS WEARING THE

04:17:04.742 --> 04:17:05.309
WRONG.

04:17:05.376 --> 04:17:08.746
SHADE OF BLUE IN THE WRONG PLACE.

04:17:08.813 --> 04:17:10.181
I RECOGNIZE THE CONCERNED BY

04:17:10.248 --> 04:17:12.950
THIS BILL BECAUSE GANG EVIDENCE

04:17:13.017 --> 04:17:14.752
IS INCENDIARY NO DOUBT ABOUT IT

04:17:14.819 --> 04:17:16.053
THAT WOULD BE A WRD I WOULD USE

04:17:16.120 --> 04:17:18.823
TO DESCRIBE BUT IT'S ALSO HIGHLY

04:17:18.890 --> 04:17:21.826
RELEVANT IN THESE TRIALS IF THIS

04:17:21.893 --> 04:17:25.263
LAW WERE TO BEEN PASSED THAT DAY.

04:17:25.329 --> 04:17:27.265
THEN TED BLACKMUN'S ATTORNEY AND

04:17:27.331 --> 04:17:28.332
I KNOW MR EYES INSTANTLY WITH

04:17:28.399 --> 04:17:29.767
THIS CASE BECAUSE HE TESTIFIED

04:17:29.834 --> 04:17:31.569
IN THAT CASE -- MR BLACKMUN'S

04:17:31.636 --> 04:17:33.371
ATTORNEY WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO

04:17:33.437 --> 04:17:34.005
STAND THERE AND SAY LADIES AND

04:17:34.071 --> 04:17:34.939
GENTLEMAN.

04:17:35.006 --> 04:17:36.541
MY CLIENT DIDN'T HAVE ANY REASON

04:17:36.607 --> 04:17:38.843
TO SHOOT THIS PERSON HE HAS HE

04:17:38.910 --> 04:17:39.710
HAS NO MOTIVE.

04:17:39.777 --> 04:17:40.812
IS THE OLDEST AND ONE OF THE

04:17:40.878 --> 04:17:42.547
MOST POBATIVE TYPES OF EVIDENCE

04:17:42.613 --> 04:17:43.481
THEY WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO HEAR

04:17:43.548 --> 04:17:44.582
ABOUT THE FACT THAT HE WAS A

04:17:44.649 --> 04:17:45.483
GANG MEMBER THAT.

04:17:45.550 --> 04:17:47.418
THE VICTIM WAS WEARING THE RIVAL

04:17:47.485 --> 04:17:48.886
GANG MEMBERS COLOR AND THAT THEY

04:17:48.953 --> 04:17:50.288
WERE IN GANG TERRITORY.

04:17:50.354 --> 04:17:51.756
AND THE REASON WHY THIS IS SO

04:17:51.823 --> 04:17:53.324
IMPORTANT IS BECAUSE GANG CRIMES

04:17:53.391 --> 04:17:56.227
ARE SO SENSELESS IF THERE LOOKED

04:17:56.294 --> 04:17:57.528
AT FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF

04:17:57.595 --> 04:17:59.197
REGULAR PEOPLE THEY DON'T HAVE

04:17:59.263 --> 04:18:00.598
ANY REASON TO THEM.

04:18:00.665 --> 04:18:01.632
WHY WAS A FIRST GRADE PREGNANT

04:18:01.699 --> 04:18:03.501
SCHOOL TEACHER STABBED BY THREE

04:18:03.568 --> 04:18:05.469
GANG MEMBERS IN HER DRIVEWAY ON

04:18:05.536 --> 04:18:07.038
MARCH TWENTY FIRST OF THIS YEAR --

04:18:07.104 --> 04:18:08.406
IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE BUT

04:18:08.472 --> 04:18:10.775
THEN IN THE GAME CONTEXT IT CAN.

04:18:10.842 --> 04:18:12.143
IT WOULD BE LIKE IN A MURDER

04:18:12.210 --> 04:18:18.149
CASE WHERE A HUSBAND IS ACCUSED

04:18:18.216 --> 04:18:19.483
OF KILLING THEIR WIFE.

04:18:19.550 --> 04:18:20.551
KEEPING OUT THE FACT THAT THE

04:18:20.618 --> 04:18:21.385
HUSBAND MAY HAVE TAKEN ON A LIFE

04:18:21.452 --> 04:18:22.854
INSURANCE POLICY A WEEK PRIOR AS

04:18:22.920 --> 04:18:24.155
EVIDENCE OF MOTIVE THE BE LIKE

04:18:24.222 --> 04:18:24.822
KEEPING UP THAT TYPE OF EVIDENCE.

04:18:24.889 --> 04:18:26.557
POWERFUL EVIDENCE OF MOTIVE.

04:18:26.624 --> 04:18:29.060
AND THE THING THAT'S MOST I

04:18:29.126 --> 04:18:31.462
THINK DANGEROUS ABOUT THIS IS AS

04:18:31.529 --> 04:18:32.997
DOCTOR RISING ALLUDED TO THERE'S

04:18:33.064 --> 04:18:34.498
DIFFERENT LEVELS OF EVIDENCE.

04:18:34.565 --> 04:18:36.534
SO TAKING THE POWER AWAY FROM

04:18:36.601 --> 04:18:38.336
THE JUDGE TO DECIDE WHETHER OR

04:18:38.402 --> 04:18:39.503
NOT THINGS COULD OR COULDN'T

04:18:39.570 --> 04:18:41.505
COME AND JUST LEAVES ONE ANSWER

04:18:41.572 --> 04:18:43.507
TO EVERY GAME CASE IT COMES OUT.

04:18:43.574 --> 04:18:45.276
EVEN I IT COULD BE VERY

04:18:45.343 --> 04:18:46.811
PROBATIVE AND NOT OVERLY

04:18:46.878 --> 04:18:48.779
PREJUDICIAL EVIDENCE SOMETIMES

04:18:48.846 --> 04:18:51.015
THE LINE BETWEEN PREJUDICE AND

04:18:51.082 --> 04:18:52.550
RELEVANCE IS SO CLOSE.

04:18:52.617 --> 04:18:54.118
THE COMING UP WITH JUST ONE

04:18:54.185 --> 04:18:56.254
ANSWER WHICH IS EXCLUSION IS IS

04:18:56.320 --> 04:18:58.155
NOT GOING TO BE THE RIGHT ANSWER.

04:18:58.222 --> 04:18:58.956
THE SECOND POINT REGARDING

04:18:59.023 --> 04:19:00.925
BLOODIER AND I'VE EXPERIENCED

04:19:00.992 --> 04:19:02.159
THIS AND THERE IS THE PREVIOUS

04:19:02.226 --> 04:19:04.495
TESTIMONY ON THIS REGARDING A

04:19:04.562 --> 04:19:06.097
JUROR'S.

04:19:06.163 --> 04:19:06.697
I'M.

04:19:06.764 --> 04:19:07.765
IF WE ARE NOT ALLOWED TO OF WHAT

04:19:07.832 --> 04:19:08.399
YOU'RE ASSUMING THE TRIAL GETS

04:19:08.466 --> 04:19:10.768
DIVIDED INTO TWO PHASES IF WE

04:19:10.835 --> 04:19:12.236
ARE NOT ALLOWED TO WATER DEAR

04:19:12.303 --> 04:19:13.471
THE JURY.

04:19:13.537 --> 04:19:15.406
DURING PHASE ONE OF THE CASE AND

04:19:15.473 --> 04:19:16.574
THESE ARE GOING TO BE VERY

04:19:16.641 --> 04:19:17.675
SERIOUS CRIMES.

04:19:17.742 --> 04:19:19.110
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO HEAR A WORD

04:19:19.176 --> 04:19:20.978
ABOUT GANG.

04:19:21.045 --> 04:19:21.812
WHEN YOU COULD HAVE?

04:19:21.879 --> 04:19:23.447
PREVIOUS VICTIMS OF GANG CRIME

04:19:23.514 --> 04:19:24.649
SITTING ON THE JURY YOU CAN HAVE

04:19:24.715 --> 04:19:26.150
PEOPLE OF ALL KINDS OF BIASES

04:19:26.217 --> 04:19:27.718
FOR THE EXACT REASON THE EARLIER

04:19:27.785 --> 04:19:28.819
TESTIMONY STATED.

04:19:28.886 --> 04:19:30.488
GANG EVIDENCE CAN HAVE AN EFFECT

04:19:30.554 --> 04:19:31.923
ON PEOPLE WHICH MEANS YOU BE

04:19:31.989 --> 04:19:33.291
PICKING JURIES FOR TRIED FOR

04:19:33.357 --> 04:19:34.926
CRIMES AND TRIALS THAT COULD

04:19:34.992 --> 04:19:36.294
LAST MONTHS.

04:19:36.360 --> 04:19:38.162
HAVING NO IDEA THAT THERE

04:19:38.229 --> 04:19:39.797
SOMEBODY HARBORING DEEP BIAS

04:19:39.864 --> 04:19:41.966
AGAINST GANGS OR FOR GANGS

04:19:42.033 --> 04:19:43.501
SITTING IN THE JURY IS GOING TO

04:19:43.567 --> 04:19:45.803
RESULT IN A MISTRIAL.

04:19:45.870 --> 04:19:47.305
IT'S GOING TO RESULT IN A HUGE

04:19:47.371 --> 04:19:48.839
WASTE OF TAXPAYER TIME AND

04:19:48.906 --> 04:19:51.475
DOLLARS DOING TRIALS FOR MONTHS

04:19:51.542 --> 04:19:53.144
ONLY TO HAVE JURORS BE TOLD AT

04:19:53.210 --> 04:19:53.945
THE BEGINNING OF PHASE TWO DO

04:19:54.011 --> 04:19:55.212
YOU LIKE DOING A DEATH PENALTY

04:19:55.279 --> 04:19:55.880
CASE.

04:19:55.947 --> 04:19:57.615
AND NOT TELLING THE JURY THAT

04:19:57.682 --> 04:19:59.283
THE CASE HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH

04:19:59.350 --> 04:19:59.850
THE DEATH PENALTY UNTIL THE

04:19:59.917 --> 04:20:01.919
PNISHMENT PHASE IT WILL RESULT

04:20:01.986 --> 04:20:03.254
IN A MISTRIAL.

04:20:03.321 --> 04:20:05.356
SO I I THINK THAT THERE IS A LOT

04:20:05.423 --> 04:20:06.557
TO BE SAID REGARDING GANG

04:20:06.624 --> 04:20:08.326
ENHANCEMENTS I THINK THAT THERE

04:20:08.392 --> 04:20:09.660
CAN BE A DIFFERENT APPROACH IS

04:20:09.727 --> 04:20:11.062
MADE THEY CAN ADDRESS THE GANG

04:20:11.128 --> 04:20:12.096
ISSUES.

04:20:12.163 --> 04:20:13.664

THE JURY.

04:20:21.939 --> 04:20:25.676

REQUIRED TO PROVE THE MOTIVE OF

04:21:17.495 --> 04:21:18.896
THE ACT.

04:21:18.963 --> 04:21:22.133
MANY TIMES THERE ARE CASES WHERE

YOU CAN.

04:21:23.501 --> 04:21:26.504
WHY DID THIS HAPPEN WHO KNOWS

A CASE THAT IS PROVED BEYOND A

04:21:46.323 --> 04:21:48.192
REASONABLE DOUBT LESS LIKELY TO

SHOW THAT THE PERSON DID NOT DO

04:24:16.607 --> 04:24:17.274
THE CRIME.

CALIFORNIA UNFORTUNATELY WE

04:50:18.167 --> 04:50:21.737
REMAIN OPPOSED TO THIS BILL --

04:50:21.804 --> 04:50:23.639
WE WON'T RELITIGATE TO THE

04:50:23.706 --> 04:50:25.608
COURSE OF SB TEN FORTY FIVE

04:50:25.674 --> 04:50:27.543
CERTAINLY AS THAT PASSED THE

04:50:27.610 --> 04:50:29.979
THIS -- LEGISLATURE LAST YEAR

04:50:30.045 --> 04:50:33.048
HOWEVER A CRITICAL PART OF SB

04:50:33.115 --> 04:50:33.549
TEN FORTY FIVE FROM OUR

04:50:33.616 --> 04:50:35.184
PERSPECTIVE AND AS IT WORKED ALL

04:50:35.251 --> 04:50:36.819
THE WAY THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE

04:50:36.886 --> 04:50:38.621
WAS THE PROVISION.

04:50:38.687 --> 04:50:41.557
THAT BEFORE USING THE

04:50:41.624 --> 04:50:43.058
CONSERVATORSHIP THAT WOULD BE

04:50:43.125 --> 04:50:45.327
AUTHORIZED BY THIS BILL THERE

04:50:45.394 --> 04:50:47.963
HAD TO BE AN OFFER OF A T. IN

04:50:48.030 --> 04:50:48.798
THE FIRST.

04:50:48.864 --> 04:50:51.433
PLACE THAT'S WHAT SB FORTY NOW

04:50:51.500 --> 04:50:52.234
DOES.

04:50:52.301 --> 04:50:55.004
IT REMOVES THE OPPORTUNITY FOR

04:50:55.070 --> 04:50:57.173
THE VOLUNTARY THE OFFER A

04:50:57.239 --> 04:50:58.340
VOLUNTARY SERVICES.

04:50:58.407 --> 04:51:00.442
AND ALL OF THE SERVICES THAT

04:51:00.509 --> 04:51:01.744
COME ALONG WITH THAT THE

04:51:01.811 --> 04:51:03.078
WRAPAROUND SERVICES THE

04:51:03.145 --> 04:51:08.117
SUPPORTIVE HOUSING IS -- IS NOT

04:51:08.184 --> 04:51:09.785
NECESSARILY AVAILABLE -- UNDER

04:51:09.852 --> 04:51:11.153
THIS BILL WHICH I THINK IT WAS

04:51:11.220 --> 04:51:13.789
THE INTENT WAS TO ACTUALLY AND

04:51:13.856 --> 04:51:17.693
DO -- THAT PROVISION SO WE

04:51:17.760 --> 04:51:20.529
CERTAINLY HAVE -- LOOKED AT THE

04:51:20.596 --> 04:51:22.965
NOW THE FACT THAT WITH THAT OUT

04:51:23.032 --> 04:51:24.700
THE THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE

04:51:24.767 --> 04:51:27.036
MADE IN THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE

04:51:27.102 --> 04:51:28.938
WHICH I THINK WERE SIGNIFICANT

04:51:29.004 --> 04:51:31.740
AND WE SUPPORTED AS THOSE --

04:51:31.807 --> 04:51:33.909
WERE MADE IN THE BILL HOWEVER

04:51:33.976 --> 04:51:34.844
LEFT.

04:51:34.910 --> 04:51:38.047
TO A VERY IMPORTANT PROVISION --

04:51:38.113 --> 04:51:39.648
AND FLAW WE THINK IN THAT IN

04:51:39.715 --> 04:51:42.084
THAT WAS THEN IT SINCE THERE WAS

04:51:42.151 --> 04:51:45.521
NO LONGER A MATTER OF RIGHT FOR

04:51:45.588 --> 04:51:48.424
THE REFERRAL FOR A T. SERVICES.

04:51:48.490 --> 04:51:51.160
THERE WAS NOW THERE IS NOW IN

04:51:51.227 --> 04:51:57.266
THAT PLACE TO READ THE ABILITY

04:51:57.333 --> 04:51:59.401
FOR THE DEPARTMENT AND IS

04:51:59.468 --> 04:52:00.069
ESSENTIALLY A BUREAUCRAT MAKING

04:52:00.135 --> 04:52:02.371
THE DETERMINATION OF WHETHER A

04:52:02.438 --> 04:52:03.305
OR T. WOULD BE APPROPRIATE OR

04:52:03.372 --> 04:52:03.906
NOT.

04:52:03.973 --> 04:52:05.207
NOW IF I DID HEAR SOME

04:52:05.274 --> 04:52:06.876
AMENDMENTS I HAVEN'T SEEN THOSE

04:52:06.942 --> 04:52:08.844
AMENDMENTS YET BUT IT SOUNDED

04:52:08.911 --> 04:52:12.214
LIKE THAT THOSE WERE ADDRESSING --

04:52:12.281 --> 04:52:13.749
THAT PROVISION AND WE THINK THAT

04:52:13.816 --> 04:52:17.920
WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL -- TO TO

04:52:17.987 --> 04:52:19.855
THE BILL -- I JUST WANNA KNOW

04:52:19.922 --> 04:52:22.524
ONE OTHER PIECE THAT WE THINK IS

04:52:22.591 --> 04:52:23.726
STILL A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM IF

04:52:23.792 --> 04:52:24.994
YOU READ THE SAN FRANCISCO

04:52:25.060 --> 04:52:27.897
CHRONICLE IN THE LAST WEEK OR SO --

04:52:27.963 --> 04:52:30.299
THEY DETAILED THE IN ONE REPORT

04:52:30.366 --> 04:52:32.001
WOULD ESSENTIALLY WAS DESCRIBED

04:52:32.067 --> 04:52:33.736
AS A BROKEN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH

04:52:33.802 --> 04:52:34.536
SYSTEM.

04:52:34.603 --> 04:52:37.106
IN IN SAN FRANCISCO.

04:52:37.172 --> 04:52:47.616
AND THE LOSS OF THE LICENSED

04:52:47.683 --> 04:52:48.851
RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES SO

04:52:48.918 --> 04:52:51.353
SIGNIFICANTLY -- AND SO WHAT WE

04:52:51.420 --> 04:52:52.721
AND THEY NOTED THE FACT THAT

04:52:52.788 --> 04:52:54.690
THERE WOULD BE MORE --

04:52:54.757 --> 04:52:57.092
CONSERVATORSHIP COMING INTO THE

04:52:57.159 --> 04:53:00.763
SYSTEM YET WE'RE IN A SYSTEM

04:53:00.829 --> 04:53:03.766
THAT CAN'T SUPPORT -- THESE

04:53:03.832 --> 04:53:05.768
ADDITIONAL CONSERVATORSHIP SO

04:53:05.834 --> 04:53:09.338
FOR THAT REASON WE WE REMAIN

04:53:09.405 --> 04:53:11.473
OPPOSED TO THE BILL [inaudible]

04:53:11.540 --> 04:53:13.242
THERE.

04:53:13.309 --> 04:53:14.476
ENTER MEMBERS MICHELLE CAPITA

04:53:14.543 --> 04:53:15.244

INTERNATIONAL UNION AND WE HAVE

04:53:16.679 --> 04:53:17.780
AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED

04:53:17.846 --> 04:53:20.849
POSITION ON THIS BILL -- ARE WE

04:53:20.916 --> 04:53:22.985
HAVE WORKED WITH THE UTHOR --

04:53:23.052 --> 04:53:24.753
AND THE SPONSORS ALL ALONG LAST

04:53:24.820 --> 04:53:26.956
YEAR AND THIS YEAR AND BECAUSE

04:53:27.022 --> 04:53:28.390
WE REPRESENT PUBLIC GUARDIANS

04:53:28.457 --> 04:53:29.959
AND CONSERVATIVES WE REPRESENT

04:53:30.025 --> 04:53:31.627
FRONTLINE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH

04:53:31.694 --> 04:53:33.195
WORKERS WHO STRADDLE BOTH THE

04:53:33.262 --> 04:53:35.264
MENTAL HEALTH AND THE S. U. D.

04:53:35.331 --> 04:53:37.700
SIDES OF THE EQUATION.

04:53:37.766 --> 04:53:39.201
AND OUR MEMBERS HAVE.

04:53:39.268 --> 04:53:40.736
A LOT OF EXPERIENCE WORKING WITH

04:53:40.803 --> 04:53:43.539
THESE POPULATIONS THEY KNOW WHAT

04:53:43.605 --> 04:53:46.442
WORKS AND WHAT HASN'T THEY HAVE

04:53:46.508 --> 04:53:47.376
CONSERVE PEOPLE THEY'VE SEEN

04:53:47.443 --> 04:53:48.644
WILL COME IN THE DOORS OF

04:53:48.711 --> 04:53:51.780
CONSERVATORSHIP -- GET BETTER AT

04:53:51.847 --> 04:53:53.882
TIMES THEY'VE ALSO NOTED TO US

04:53:53.949 --> 04:53:55.084
IN PART OF THE REASON FOR

04:53:55.150 --> 04:53:57.252
OPPOSITION HAS BEEN THAT WITH

04:53:57.319 --> 04:54:00.022
SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS -- IT IS

04:54:00.089 --> 04:54:02.825
VERY HARD TO IMPOSSIBLE TO

04:54:02.891 --> 04:54:03.926
COMPEL.

04:54:03.993 --> 04:54:05.327
TREATMENT FORCE TREATMENT WHEN

04:54:05.394 --> 04:54:07.429
AN INDIVIDUAL IS NOT READY FOR

04:54:07.496 --> 04:54:08.263
RECOVERY.

04:54:08.330 --> 04:54:09.465
LOCKED BEDS FOR SUBSTANCE USE

04:54:09.531 --> 04:54:13.235
DISORDERS DO NOT EXIST -- AND SO

04:54:13.302 --> 04:54:15.637
WHEN WE STEPPED DOWN IT IS OFTEN

04:54:15.704 --> 04:54:17.206
THE CASE SOMEONE HAS NOT CLEARED

04:54:17.272 --> 04:54:19.441
UP ON THE MENTAL HEALTH SIDE.

04:54:19.508 --> 04:54:20.776
AND WE INTRODUCE THEM TO

04:54:20.843 --> 04:54:23.312
SUBSTANCE USE RECOVERY SERVICES --

04:54:23.379 --> 04:54:26.448
IF THEY'RE NOT READY THEY WILL

04:54:26.515 --> 04:54:28.417
LEAVE THOSE FOR A STEP DOWN

04:54:28.484 --> 04:54:29.551
FACILITIES AND SO.

04:54:29.618 --> 04:54:32.054
WHAT WE ARE EMBARKING ON HERE BY

04:54:32.121 --> 04:54:34.156
CREATING A NEW CONSERVATORSHIP

04:54:34.223 --> 04:54:36.091
THAT IS SPECIFICALLY TARGETED AT

04:54:36.158 --> 04:54:38.827
A COAL OCCURRING -- POPULATION

04:54:38.894 --> 04:54:40.329
WITH BOTH A CD AND MENTAL

04:54:40.396 --> 04:54:42.131
ILLNESS IS THAT WE'RE GOING TO

04:54:42.197 --> 04:54:43.399
BE EXPERIMENTING WITH WHAT DOES

04:54:43.465 --> 04:54:44.733
IT LOOK LIKE TO TARGET A

04:54:44.800 --> 04:54:46.535
CONSERVATORSHIP THAT HAS AS ITS

04:54:46.602 --> 04:54:48.737
BASIS BOTH CONDITIONS.

04:54:48.804 --> 04:54:50.572
AND WE BELIEVE THAT IT'S REALLY

04:54:50.639 --> 04:54:52.241
IMPORTANT TO STUDY THIS QUESTION

04:54:52.307 --> 04:54:53.509
SO ONE OF OUR REQUESTED

04:54:53.575 --> 04:54:54.877
AMENDMENTS IS FOR A THOROUGH

04:54:54.943 --> 04:54:56.779
EVALUATION TO SEE WHAT ARE THE

04:54:56.845 --> 04:54:58.213
SERVICES THAT ARE PROVIDED TO

04:54:58.280 --> 04:54:59.648
THIS POPULATION WHILE THEY'RE IN

04:54:59.715 --> 04:55:01.784
THIS CONSERVATORSHIP.

04:55:01.850 --> 04:55:03.118
HOW DO THEY FAIR IN THE END --

04:55:03.185 --> 04:55:04.720
BUT WE KNOW THAT COMPULSORY DRUG

04:55:04.787 --> 04:55:06.488
TREATMENT IN OTHER REGIONS OF

04:55:06.555 --> 04:55:08.057
THE COUNTRY AND AROUND THE WORLD

04:55:08.123 --> 04:55:15.664
HAVE HAD OFTEN SOME NEGATIVE

04:55:15.731 --> 04:55:18.100
WERE NOT READY. TO GET CLEAN --

04:55:18.167 --> 04:55:19.401
THEY OFTEN GO RIGHT BACK TO

04:55:19.468 --> 04:55:20.369
USING AND ARE UP TO FORTY TIMES

04:55:20.436 --> 04:55:21.837
MORE LIKELY TO DIE WITHIN TWO

04:55:21.904 --> 04:55:22.871
WEEKS OF RELEASE -- THAT IS

04:55:22.938 --> 04:55:25.240
SIGNIFICANT WE KNOW THAT -- FOR

THIS SPECIAL KIND OF

04:55:35.617 --> 04:55:36.385
CONSERVATORSHIP THAT'S REALLY

04:55:36.452 --> 04:55:38.253
IMPORTANT WE ALSO BELIEVE IT'S

04:55:38.320 --> 04:55:39.955
REALLY IMPORTANT TO FRONT LOAD.

04:55:40.022 --> 04:55:41.223
ACCESS TO THOSE VOLUNTARY

04:55:41.290 --> 04:55:42.825
SERVICES OUR MEMBERS SAY THAT

04:55:42.891 --> 04:55:45.027
WHEN WE OFFER WHEN WE PROVIDE WE

04:55:45.094 --> 04:55:46.762
REALLY ENGAGE FOLKS AND DEVELOP

04:55:46.829 --> 04:55:49.231
A RELATIONSHIP OVER TIME. TO GET

04:55:49.298 --> 04:55:50.666
THEM INTO VOLUNTARY SERVICES

04:55:50.732 --> 04:55:53.335

WILLING TO DO TO AVAIL

04:55:55.104 --> 04:55:56.905
THEMSELVES BUT IT TAKES TIME.

04:55:56.972 --> 04:55:58.807
IT'S NOT A QUICK FIX AND IT'S

04:55:58.874 --> 04:56:00.576
ALSO NOT A SILVER BULLET MANY OF

04:56:00.642 --> 04:56:01.977
THESE INDIVIDUALS DESPITE OUR

04:56:02.044 --> 04:56:03.312

USE CONSERVATORSHIP SAYS IN THE

04:56:42.784 --> 04:56:43.919
ANSWER TO OUR HOUSING CRISIS.

04:56:43.986 --> 04:56:45.687
SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND MENTAL

OF CONSERVATORSHIP ISN'T

04:56:52.294 --> 04:56:53.862
APPROACH WE SHOULD TAKE.

04:56:53.929 --> 04:56:54.963
IT DOES NOT ADDRESS THE

04:56:55.030 --> 04:56:56.598
HOPELESSNESS OF THE LACK OF

04:56:56.665 --> 04:56:58.066
HOUSING FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS

04:56:58.133 --> 04:57:00.102
PEOPLE NOR DOES IT PROVIDE

04:57:00.169 --> 04:57:01.837
FUNDING FOR THE ADDITIONAL NEED.

04:57:01.904 --> 04:57:03.472

UNDER GOVERNOR REAGAN THE STATE

04:57:11.246 --> 04:57:13.615
HOSPITALS WERE ESSENTIALLY EMPTY

04:57:13.682 --> 04:57:15.350
AND PERSONS WERE SENT TO THEIR

04:57:15.417 --> 04:57:16.919
COMMUNITIES FOR TREATMENT AND

04:57:16.985 --> 04:57:18.153
CARE.

04:57:18.220 --> 04:57:20.222
THIS IS BOTH GOOD AND BAD IT WAS

04:57:20.289 --> 04:57:23.258
GOOD IN THAT IT MITIGATED THE

04:57:23.325 --> 04:57:26.195
OVER USE -- OF THE HOSPITALS IN

04:57:26.261 --> 04:57:28.363
THE ABUSE WITHIN THE MIDDLES

04:57:28.430 --> 04:57:29.932
HOSPITALS.

04:57:29.998 --> 04:57:31.200
THE BAND IS THAT THE MONEY FOR

04:57:31.266 --> 04:57:32.701
THE COMMUNITIES TO PROVIDE THIS

04:57:32.768 --> 04:57:35.571

04:57:37.039 --> 04:57:38.307
BETWEEN THE LACK OF ADEQUATE

04:58:17.212 --> 04:58:19.314
THAT LIST THEY ARE ON LAST THEY

04:58:19.381 --> 04:58:23.752
SIT IN JAIL BECAUSE THERE ARE NO

04:58:23.819 --> 04:58:26.321
LESS RISK GIVE PLACEMENTS FOR

04:58:26.388 --> 04:58:27.022
THEM.

04:58:27.089 --> 04:58:28.357
DUE TO THE FAILURE FUNDING.

INVOLUNTARY CIVIL COMMITMENTS

04:58:55.884 --> 04:58:57.519
ARE POWERFUL TOOLS.

04:58:57.586 --> 04:58:59.388
USE OF THEM MUST BE TIGHTLY

04:58:59.454 --> 04:59:00.622
CONTROLLED.

04:59:00.689 --> 04:59:02.424
EXPANDING THEM WOULD ALWAYS GIVE

04:59:02.491 --> 04:59:04.860
IT SHOULD ALWAYS GIVE US PAUSE.

04:59:04.926 --> 04:59:07.062
SB FORTY TAKES AN UNTESTED NEW

04:59:07.129 --> 04:59:08.797

COUNTERPRODUCTIVE AND

AFTER THE BILL CAME OUT OF THIS

05:01:20.495 --> 05:01:22.431

05:01:59.100 --> 05:02:00.735
INAPPROPRIATE.

05:02:00.802 --> 05:02:02.337
AND SO WHAT THAT AMENDMENT DID

05:02:02.404 --> 05:02:03.472

06:07:05.103 --> 06:07:05.636
TEENAGER WHEN I COMMITTED MY

06:07:05.703 --> 06:07:06.204
CRIME.

06:07:06.270 --> 06:07:08.206
AND IN TWO THOUSAND AND

06:07:08.272 --> 06:07:09.841
SEVENTEEN I WAS FOUND SUITABLE

06:07:09.907 --> 06:07:11.109
FOR PAROLE WHICH IS.

06:07:11.175 --> 06:07:15.546
NO EASY TASK AND IT'S NOT JUST

06:07:15.613 --> 06:07:16.180
BECAUSE OF THE CRIMES BUT ALSO

06:07:16.247 --> 06:07:17.248
JUST BECAUSE I HAVE TO WORK

06:07:17.315 --> 06:07:20.251
PASSED THE TRAUMAS THAT LED ME

06:07:20.318 --> 06:07:20.852
TO A CRIMINAL LIFESTYLE IN THE

06:07:20.918 --> 06:07:24.021
FIRST PLACE.

06:07:24.088 --> 06:07:26.023
AND ANOTHER BARRIER.

06:07:26.090 --> 06:07:27.458
TO MY TRANSFORMATION AND HEALING

06:07:27.525 --> 06:07:27.959
WAS ACTUALLY THE PRISON

06:07:28.025 --> 06:07:30.061
ENVIRONMENT AND WHEN I FIRST

06:07:30.128 --> 06:07:31.996
BEGAN MY PRISON SENTENCE.

06:07:32.063 --> 06:07:33.998
I WAS PLACED IN A IN AN

06:07:34.065 --> 06:07:36.134
ENVIRONMENT WHERE IT WAS.

06:07:36.200 --> 06:07:37.735
MORE ABOUT SURVIVAL THAN ANY --

06:07:37.802 --> 06:07:40.805
TRANSFORMATIVE PROGRAMS ARE

06:07:40.872 --> 06:07:42.373
HEALING AND RESTORATIVE JUSTICE.

06:07:42.440 --> 06:07:44.642
BUT FINALLY AFTER GETTING TO US

06:07:44.709 --> 06:07:45.810
AND CLINTON.

06:07:45.877 --> 06:07:47.178
I WAS ABLE TO TAKE SOME

06:07:47.245 --> 06:07:49.213
REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS AND IN

06:07:49.280 --> 06:07:50.915
ONE OF THESE PROGRAMS --

06:07:50.982 --> 06:07:52.550
SURVIVOR OF PRIME.

06:07:52.617 --> 06:07:55.386
SHARE YOUR STORY WITH US AND NO

06:07:55.453 --> 06:07:57.622
THE FIRST TIME I EVER BROKE DOWN

06:07:57.688 --> 06:08:00.525
IN A IN A IN A GROUP.

06:08:00.591 --> 06:08:01.859
BUT IT WAS REALLY TRANSFORMATIVE

06:08:01.926 --> 06:08:03.594
AND HOW FROM FOR ME TO COME FACE

06:08:03.661 --> 06:08:04.829
TO FACE WITH THIS WOMAN TO

06:08:04.896 --> 06:08:05.930
REALLY LOOK AT THE CRIMES THAT I

06:08:05.997 --> 06:08:07.432
HAD COMMITTED INNER IN A REAL

06:08:07.498 --> 06:08:08.900
AND HONEST WAY.

06:08:08.966 --> 06:08:10.134
AND THAT PUT ME ON A POSITIVE

06:08:10.201 --> 06:08:16.207
PATH -- AFTER THAT -- AFTER

06:08:16.274 --> 06:08:18.476
TAKING THOSE PROGRAMS I LEARNED --

06:08:18.543 --> 06:08:20.144
TO WHAT LED ME TO THE CRIME AS

06:08:20.211 --> 06:08:22.046
IS IN -- INSIDE IS NEEDED TO BE

06:08:22.113 --> 06:08:23.815
GRANTED PAROLE -- AND ONE OF

06:08:23.881 --> 06:08:25.183
THOSE THINGS THAT I FOUND WAS

06:08:25.249 --> 06:08:26.651
THAT YOU HAVE TO DE HUMANIZE.

06:08:26.717 --> 06:08:29.053
VICTIMS YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THEM

06:08:29.120 --> 06:08:30.788
IS NOT HUMAN BEINGS.

06:08:30.855 --> 06:08:32.457
ACTUALLY PERPETRATED CRIME

06:08:32.523 --> 06:08:34.025
BECAUSE IT'S HARD TO HOW HARM

06:08:34.091 --> 06:08:37.428
ANOTHER HUMAN BEING -- AND THEN

06:08:37.495 --> 06:08:38.896
ONCE YOU COMMIT A CRIME.

06:08:38.963 --> 06:08:40.164
YOU PUT IN A CAGE AND PUT

06:08:40.231 --> 06:08:42.066
THROUGH A VERY IMPERSONAL

06:08:42.133 --> 06:08:43.968
PROCESS.

06:08:44.035 --> 06:08:45.470
IN THE COURT YOU APPEAR COUGHED

06:08:45.536 --> 06:08:48.406
UP -- TOLD TO FACE FORWARD ONLY

06:08:48.473 --> 06:08:49.574
LOOK AT THE JUDGE.

06:08:49.640 --> 06:08:52.743
AND DON'T LOOK AT THE VIC.

06:08:52.810 --> 06:08:53.511
CRIME.

06:08:53.578 --> 06:08:56.113
AND AND TO ME THAT'S LOOKING

06:08:56.180 --> 06:08:58.249
BACK RIBS.

06:08:58.316 --> 06:09:01.352
THAT'S NOT OKAY WITH A PRISON.

06:09:01.419 --> 06:09:03.254
PRISON SYSTEM CRIMINAL JUSTICE

06:09:11.929 --> 06:09:13.431
THINGS ANYWAY -- BUT YEAH SO

06:09:13.498 --> 06:09:14.932
JUST LOOKING AT THE PRISON

SYSTEM -- WE DON'T REQUIRE

06:09:16.868 --> 06:09:18.469
OFFENDERS TO SEE THEIR VICTIMS

06:09:18.536 --> 06:09:20.171
AND THERE'S NO OPPORTUNITY TO

06:09:20.238 --> 06:09:21.639
MAKE AMENDS EVEN IF THE VICTIM

06:09:21.706 --> 06:09:23.708

06:09:27.512 --> 06:09:28.980
PROGRAM WOULD NOT INCLUDE --
