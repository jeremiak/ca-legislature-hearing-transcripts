PLEASE COME TO THE PODIUM ASSEMBLYMEMBER RADIUS ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY ONE OH SEVEN PLEASE PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS LET ME BEGIN BY THANKING THE CHAIR AND THE COMMITTEE STUFF FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS BILL. I WOULD LIKE TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE YOU SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS THAT ARE LISTED ON PAGE TEN. OF THE ANALYSIS ON AS THE AUTHORS AMENDMENTS. AB TWENTY ONE OH SEVEN UPDATES THE LAWS GOVERNING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE AUTOMOBILE MANUFACTURERS AND FRANCHISE NEW CAR DEALERS TO BRING EQUITY TO THIS VITAL RELATIONSHIP. THE NEW CAR DEALERS OPERATING AS LOCAL INDEPENDENTLY OWNED FRANCHISED DEALERSHIPS IN OUR COMMUNITIES CREATE JOBS AND HELP OUR STE HELP SPUR LOCAL ECONOMIC GROWTH. THEY'RE OFTEN THE FIRST POINT OF CONTACT BETWEEN THE CONSUMER AND THE SPECIFIC CAR BRAND. THE AUTO INDUSTRY AND THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF AUTOMOBILE SALES WITH SOME LIMITED EGGS HAVE EXCEPTIONS. RELIES ON THE FRANCHISE SYSTEM BETWEEN THE AUTOMAKERS AND THE DEALERS. THIS IS WHY IT IS IMPORTANT TO ENSURE THAT THE BALANCE OF POWER BETWEEN LARGE MULTINATIONAL AUTO MAKERS AND CALIFORNIA'S NEW CAR DEALERS IS A FAIR AND COMPETITIVE PLAYING FIELD. AB TO ONE OH SEVEN CONTAINS NUMEROUS PROVISIONS TO ADDRESS SEVERAL KEY ISSUES THAT WILL ENSURE THE CALIFORNIA CAR DEALERS ARE PROTECTED. AND IN TURN THAT CONSUMERS WILL BE PROTECTED. YES MEMBERS THIS IS A LARGE AND COMPLEX BILL. IT IS LARGE AND COMPLEX BECAUSE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DEALERS AND MANUFACTURERS IS ALSO A LARGE AND COMPLEX. HOWEVER MOST OF THE PROVISIONS OF THE OF THIS BILL ARE ALREADY THE LAW IN OVER TWENTY STATES. AND SOME PROVISIONS ARE THE LAW IN FORTY STATES. I REMAIN COMMITTED ALONG WITH MY STAFF IN THE SPONSORS TO CONTINUE DISCUSSIONS WITH THE OPPOSITION. I BELIEVE THAT MANY OF THE ISSUES THAT WILL BE. THAT THEY WILL HIGHLIGHT CAN BE RESOLVED VIA CLARIFYING LANGUAGE AND FURTHER NEGOTIATIONS. AND I AM COMMITTED TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. AND CONSIDERATION. WITH ME TODAY TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT IS CLIFF COSTA FROM THE CALIFORNIA NEW CAR DEALERS ASSOCIATION. PLEASE PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY FOR. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS CLIFF COST ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA NEW CAR DEALERS ASSOCIATION. FIRST BEFORE I START I'D LIKE TO THINK THE AUTHOR. CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR ALL THE TIME THAT THEY'VE SPENT. ON THIS BILL. CALIFORNIA FRANCHISE LAWS ARE IMPORTANT NOT JUST A FRANCHISE NEW CAR DEALERS BUT TO THE STATE TO CONSUMERS. IT IS WHY THE FRANCHISE LAWS HAVE BEEN AROUND SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE. EVERY FEW YEARS CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE STEPS AND TO HELP. ADDRESS THE INHERENT POWER IMBALANCE BETWEEN THE INTERNATIONAL AUTOMAKERS IN YOUR LOCALLY OWNED INDEPENDENT NEW CAR DEALERS WHO STILL OPERATE AS FAMILY BUSINESSES IN EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOUR DISK. AB TWENTY ONE OH SEVEN IS NOT DIFFERENT FROM PREVIOUS FRANCHISE BILLS. THE DRESS SPIN CIVIC AUTOMAKER BEHAVIOR. BEHAVIOR THAT UNDERMINES OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE FRANCHISE AGREEMENT CALIFORNIA FRANCHISE LAWS IN THE BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN AUTOMAKERS AND DEALERS. ASSEMBLY WOMAN REYES IS CORRECT. IT'S BILLS COMPLEX. BUT AS ARE ALL FRANCHISE BILLS. WE COVER TOPICS LIKE WARRANTY REIMBURSEMENT WHERE WE WANT TO FOLLOW FORTY OTHER STATES. TO CREATE A STATUTORY PROCESS TO RECEIVE. RETAIL RATES FOR PARTS AND LABOR. STILL ANY UPGRADES WHERE WE HAVE ALREADY REACHED A COMPROMISE WITH ONE OF THE AUTO MAKER TRADE ASSOCIATION. AND FRANCHISE OR COMPETITION WHERE WE ARE CLARIFYING THE EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS THAT THE AUTOMAKERS GAVE TO THEIR FRANCHISE DEALERS IN OUR FRANCHISE AGREEMENTS. THESE ARE JUST A FEW OF THE IMPORTANT PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL. NOW FRANCHISE BILLS TYPICALLY WORK LIKE THIS. SEEN SEDIA DOCUMENTS. USE OF BEHAVIORS BY THE AUTOMAKERS WITHIN REACH OUT EITHER THROUGH A LETTER OR PHONE CALL TO THE AUTOMAKERS WE TRY TO RECTIFY THE PROBLEM. WHEN WE CAN'T RESOLVE THE PROBLEM WITHIN SPONSOR LEGISLATION. WHEN THAT BILL COMES FORWARD. THE AUTOMAKERS IN THE DEALER'S BEGIN A PROCESS WHERE WE NEGOTIATE. SOMETIMES WE AMEND CALIFORNIA FRANCHISE LAWS SOMETIMES WE AGREE TO NOT TO AMEND. FRANCHISE LAWS. RECENTLY WE REACHED AN AGREEMENT WITH HUN DIAGENESIS. WHERE THEY WILL BE SENDING OUT A COMMUNICATION CLARIFYING THAT HYUNDAI DEALERS CAN CONTINUE TO SELL? AND SERVICE THEIR VEHICLES. THAT ARE GENESIS MODELS THEY'VE ALREADY SOLD SO SPECIFICALLY WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS IS THERE IS COMMUNICATION THE HYUNDAI GENESIS MADE FORWARD TO MY MEMBERS. WHICH SAID. WELL WASN'T CLEAR WHETHER OR NOT THE CARS THEY READY SOUL TO YOUR CUSTOMERS YOUR CONSUMERS. WHETHER NOT WE COULD REPAIR THOSE VEHICLES. CLEARLY A MISUNDERSTANDING AND HYUNDAI GENESIS IS GOING TO SEND OUT A COMMUNICATION TO MY MEMBERS AND WHEN THEY DO DO THAT THE AUTHOR AND US HAS AGREED TO REMOVE THAT PROVISION. THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF THE FRANCHISE BILL WORKING TO REACH COMPROMISES. ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS WHERE LATER THIS WEEK THE VOLVO C. E. O. OF NORTH AMERICA'S COMING TO SACRAMENTO TO MEET IN OUR OFFICE WITH CALIFORNIA VOCAL DEALERS. WHERE THEY WILL DISCUSS THE NEW SUBSCRIPTION PROGRAMS? WE LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING HOW THIS MEANS PROGRESS. MATT. IN CONCLUSION. WE'RE REALLY ASKING YOU TO ALLOW US TO MOVE THIS BILL FOR TODAY SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE THE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AUTOMAKERS. WE ALREADY MEETING WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS IN OUR FINDING COMMON GROUND. WE HAVE RETAKEN AMENDMENTS ON BEHALF OF GLOBAL AUTOMAKERS AND SEE JACK WE HAVE REACHED AGREEMENTS WITH HUN DYING NISSAN IN THE CONSUMER ATTORNEYS AND HAVE HAD PRODUCTIVE MEETINGS WITH. TECH MEANT. WHAT THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS TAKEN TODAY WITH AMENDMENTS WE'VE ALREADY MADE AND ARE COMMITTED TO MAKING WE HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY NARROWED THE SCOPE OF THIS BILL? WE ARE COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TO WORK OUT THERE ARE ISSUES WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS. TODAY I STAND READY TO ANSWERING SPECIFIC YOU MAY HAVE ABOUT THE BILL BUT ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA'S THIRTEEN HUNDRED NEW CAR DEALERSHIPS. AND ARE HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND EMPLOYEES WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR. NEXT WITNESS TO PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME IN HERE REPRESENTING PLEASE AND. HE BITUMINOUS HAVE CAMPUS MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE JAMES LOMBARDA SENIOR BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA MOTORCYCLE DEALERS ASSOCIATION. I WE WERE LAKE IN OUR LETTER IN BECAUSE OF THE MEANT AMENDMENTS THAT WERE COMING FORTH THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WITH THE FINAL OF. FORM THE BILL WOULD BE AND AND YES WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE BILL. UP. OUR MOM UNPOPULAR ZERO EVEN SMALLER THAN. BIG CAR DEALERS I MEAN YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW SOME A VERY NEAR NEIGHBORHOOD IF YOU LOOK AROUND THERE ARE MOTORCYCLE DEALERS WERE VERY SMALL. AND WE'RE HAVING TO DEAL WITH HONDA CORPORATION THAT HAS MULTI AUTOMOBILES ALONG WITH. OTHER PRODUCTS BMW. AND YOUR YOUR SINGLE DEALER TRYING TO GET PARTS EQUIPMENT AND AND. MODELS TO SELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER. THERE WAS A PUBLIC THAT WOULD LIKE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE AUTHORS BILL. SEEING NONE ANY MEMBERS THE PUBLIC FEEL LIKE TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION. OR VOICE THEIR OPINION ON THE AUTHORS BILL. WE STOPPED FOR. PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME AND WHO YOU REPRESENT CLEARLY PLEASE FOR THE RECORD. MY NAME IS JEAN URBAN. I REPRESENT THE ALLIANCE OF AUTOMOBILE MANUFACTURERS AND WE ARE OPPOSED TO THE BILL. AS IT IS IN PRINT TODAY AND IS IS IS PROPOSED TO BE AMENDED. AS URINALYSIS NOTES WE DO THIS PERIODICALLY. EVERY TWO OR THREE YEARS OF BILL ARRIVES REGARDLESS. OF THE MARKETPLACE REGARDLESS OF THE CONDITIONS. I WOULD SUGGEST THIS IS THE BIGGEST BILL WE'VE EVER CONFRONTED THAT ONE FOR WILL THAT THERE'S BEEN THE LEAST EVIDENCE. THE LAST FIVE OR SIX YEARS HAVE BEEN HEALTHY AND TIMES FOR THE INDUSTRY. NATIONALLY IN THIS STATE WE SOLD MORE CARS THAN EVER BEFORE. WE ARE SELLING CLEANER MORE EFFICIENT CARS AND EVER BEFORE SCHAEFER. ALL OF THAT THIS BILL WILL IMPEDE THAT. IT WILL INCREASE THE COST OF NEW CARS. IT WILL INCREASE THE COST OF SERVICING THOSE CARS IT WILL DELAY IN IMPEDE THE DEPLOYMENT OF. CLEANER AND MORE EFFICIENT VEHICLES INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINES. ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES CONNECTIVITY. VEHICLE THE VEHICLE COMMUNICATION VEHICLE TO PEDESTRIAN VEHICLE THE INFRASTRUCTURE. AND LASTLY AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE TECHNOLOGY LET ALONE AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES THEMSELVES BUT THE TECHNOLOGY. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THREE OR FOUR THE PROVISIONS. MISTER CHAIRMAN WITH YOUR. PERMISSION. THE FACILITY INVESTMENT ON PAGE THIRTY FOUR. I ASK YOU TO READ IT. SAYS IF THEY'VE DONE SOMETHING IN THE LAST TEN YEARS THEY DON'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING AGAIN. ARE YOU SERIOUS REALLY. THINK OF WHAT A CAR WAS LIKE TEN YEARS AGO. AND WHAT IT WILL BE LIKE IN TEN YEARS IF THEY DON'T INVEST. IN. ELECTRONIC. DEVICES. TO DIAGNOSE VEHICLES AS OPPOSED TO RANCHERS WE'RE GONNA BE IN SERIOUS TROUBLE. IF THEY DON'T INVEST. IN SOME OF THE OTHER TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE GONNA BE REQUIRED LIKE ALUMINUM YOU CAN'T. DO ALUMINUM NEXT TO STEAL IT DOESN'T WORK YOU HAVE TO INVEST. HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE EXEMPTION THEY PUT ON IN ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES. THAT'S TODAY IN F. ONE FIFTIES INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINES THINK ABOUT THAT. THEY ARE NOT REQUIRED AS A MATTER OF FRANCHISE AGREEMENT TO DO MAKE ANY INVESTMENT. MORE OFTEN THAN TEN YEARS AT THE LOWEST AMOUNT NO AMOUNT IS SPECIFIED IN THE BILL. THEY COULD LITERALLY INVEST THAT DOLLAR. AND WE WOULD BE UNABLE TO RESPOND. I'M THE SUBSCRIPTION ON PAGE TWENTY SIX. WE USE A SUBSCRIPTION RIGHT NOW TO TEST VEHICLES BEFORE PRODUCTION. WE TEST NEW TECHNOLOGIES. NEW POWERTRAINS NEW TRANSMISSIONS. THAT ARGUABLY WOULD BE GREATLY RESTRICTED AND WHOSE RESTRICTED ONLY US NO ONE ELSE IS RESTRICTED ONLY THE FRANCHISE OR ONLY THE ENTITY MAKING THE EQUIPMENT IS RESTRICTED. SO WELL AGAIN THAT WILL IMPEDE THE DELIVERY OF NEW MOBILITY OPTIONS AND NEW VEHICLES. THE PEOPLE YOU REPRESENT. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE. STATE Y. RELEVANT MARKET AREA ON PAGE. TWENTY FIVE. AN INNOCUOUS CHANGE RIGHT NOW THE RELEVANT MARKET AREA. IN WHICH A DEALER CAN PROTEST THE NEW MOTOR VEHICLE BOARD IS A TEN MILE RADIUS. UNDER THIS BILL IT'S NOW THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WHO HERE CAN TELL ME WHAT THAT MEANS? DOES THAT MEAN A DEALER IN IMPERIAL COUNTY CAN PROTEST SOMETHING THAT OCCURS IN DEL NORTE COUNTY. IT HAS NO PRECISE MEANING AND EXISTS NOWHERE ELSE IN THE NATION. THAT ALONE THAT ALONE WILL THROW. DOZENS. PERHAPS MORE DISPUTES INTO THE NEW MOTOR VEHICLE BOARD. LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT FOR A SECOND. MR ROOM AS HE WRAPPED UP. THE NEW MOTOR VEHICLE BOARD IS GIVEN RIGHT NEW POWERS PURSUANT TO UNFAIR PROCEDURES. IN WHICH EVIDENCE THE RULES OF EVIDENCE ARE BEING MANIPULATED BY THE SPONSORS OF THIS BILL. THEY CAN INTRODUCE EVIDENCE OF OUR ALLEGED VIOLATIONS ALLEGED VIOLATIONS WE ON THE OTHER HAND CANNOT. THE BILL IS OVERBROAD AS EVERYONE HERE KNOWS AS HAS BEEN ADMITTED BY THE SPONSOR. IT IS OVER REACHING OVER BROAD AND SHOULD NOT MOVE OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE TODAY. THANK YOU THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS. PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME AND WHO REPRESENTING PLEASING. THE CURRENT MEMBERS BILLY GOING REPRESENT THE MOTORCYCLE INDUSTRY COUNCIL RECREATIONAL OFF HIGHWAY VEHICLE ASSOCIATION. AND I'M NOT SURE THAT I CAN BE AS ELOQUENT AS MR URBAN. BUT THE AUTHOR AND THE SPONSORS BULLSHIT. IT WE NEW CAR MANUFACTURERS AND FRANCHISE NEW CAR DEALERS. UNFORTUNATELY THE CODE SECTION OF THE SEASON WOULD INCLUDE MOTORCYCLE MANUFACTURERS PEOPLE LICKED OFF ROAD. VEHICLES AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE LATE WOULD WOULD BE BUT I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO SEE. BECAUSE WE WOULD WONDER FOR A NEW CAR DEALERS FRANCHISE AGREEMENT. NOR SHOULD THEY SET STATUTE THAT WOULD AFFECT OUR FRANCHISE AGREEMENT WITH OUR DEALS. SO WE ANNOUNCED THAT WE COULD BUILD A WORK OF SOME KIND OF A MEMBER TO. EXCEPT OR PUT THE MOTORCYCLE INDUSTRY. THE OTHER THE BILL THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS I'M ROSEMARY SHE HIM PRESIDENT CONSUMERS FOR AUTO RELIABILITY AND SAFETY. AND WE DON'T USUALLY TESTIFY ON THE SAME SIDE WITH THEM MANUFACTURERS WERE KNOWN FURNISHING AIDING CALIFORNIA'S ARE A LEMON LAW. AND. SPONSORING OTHER LEGISLATION TO IMPROVE PROTECTIONS FOR CONSUMERS IN CALIFORNIA THIS IS SORT OF A UNIQUE SITUATION WHERE WE DO HAPPEN TO AGREE. THAT. THERE ARE REAL PROBLEMS WITH THE NEW MOTOR VEHICLE BOARD THAT COULD POTENTIALLY IMPACT. CONSUMERS SO WE REGRET WE MUST JOIN IN OPPOSING THE BILL. THERE'S A LONG HISTORY HERE WHERE. WE BELIEVE THAT WE ARE THE ONLY STATE IN THE NATION THAT HAS A BOARD. THAT IS STRUCTURED SO THAT IT CAN ACTUALLY OVERRULE THE DMV SO IN THE PAST WHEN THE DMV HAS ACTED TO PROTECT CONSUMERS AND CRACK DOWN ON DEALERS WHO WERE. ENGAGING IN MASSIVE FRAUD AND OTHER ILLEGAL ACTIVITY. THE DEALERS HOLD IT OVER THE. DMV'S HEAD THAT THEY CAN APPEAL TO THE NEW MOTOR VEHICLE BOARD AND GET THE CASES OVERTURNED. AND IN FACT THEY SUCCEEDED IN DOING THAT IN A CASE INVOLVING CHRYSLER IT'S A LEMON LAUNDERING THE DEALERS. EXCEEDED IN OVERTURNING THE CASE AND THE DMV HOW TO SPEND. ENORMOUS AMOUNTS OF TIME MONEY RESOURCES TO DEFEND THEMSELVES AGAINST. CHRYSLER IN ITS DEALERS. SO. WE'RE CONCERNED THAT. THIS WOULD INCREASE HER POWER THAT THAT. THE NEW MOTOR VEHICLE HAVE BOARD HAS AND WILL MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR MANUFACTURERS WHO HAVE PRO CONSUMER POLICIES. TO ENFORCE THEM FOR INSTANCE GM ENTERED INTO CONSENT AGREEMENTS WITH. ATTORNEY GENERAL BEAU SARAH AND THE AG'S IN. FORTY NINE. FORTY EIGHT OTHER STATES AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA REGARDING. OF THE SALES OF BY THEIR DEALERS OF SO CALLED GM CERTIFIED CARS AND THEY AGREED THAT THOSE COULD NOT BE UNDER SAFETY RECALL. THIS IS GM'S POLICY THERE ON THE. LINE FOR ENFORCING THAT WERE CONCERNED THE BILL MAY MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO DO THAT. CHRIS WRAPPED UP. WE WOULD ASK YOUR NOVA THANK YOU THANK YOU ANY OTHER MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC LIKE TO TESTIFY OPPOSITION TO THE AUTHORS BILL OR WAS IT. PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME ANY REPRESENT PLEASE GOOD AFTERNOON JUST ADVANCE ON BEHALF OF TECHNO UNFORTUNATES TO PROVISIONS. THAT WE HAVE NOT REACHED RESOLUTION YET ONE ON THE. MOBILITY PROGRAMS IN E. COMMERCE BUT WE'VE HAD WONDERFUL CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE HAD THE SPONSORS WE HOPE TO BE ABLE TO REMOVE OPPOSITION. THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS IVAN ALL TOMORROW BEHALF OF GLOBAL AUTOMAKERS I JUST WOULD LIKE TO CLARIFY ONE THING THAT WAS. STATED IN REGARDS TO THE ARM. THE NEW CAR DEALERS IN THEIR WORK WITH THE GLOBAL AUTOMAKERS WE SAT DOWN WITH GLOBAL WITH ON THE NEW CAR DEALERS WE DID PROVIDE THEM FEEDBACK. MOST OF WHAT WE PROVIDED WAS THAT PROVISIONS IN THIS BILL MAJORITY OF WHICH WERE DISCUSSED TODAY BY THE ALLIANCE WHICH WE ALIGN OUR COMMENTS WITH. WE THINK SHOULD BE STRICKEN FROM THE BILL WE DID PROVIDE SOME FEEDBACK ON SOME PROVISION SOME OF WHICH REAP REFLECTED IN THE. IN THE ANALYSIS BUT FOR THE MOST PART THE MOST EGREGIOUS PARTS OF THE BILL WE DO AGREE. AS THE A NEW CAR DEALER STATED THAT THESE THINGS SHOULD BE. DON NEGOTIATED BETWEEN NEW CAR DEALERS AND BETWEEN THE MANUFACTURERS AND WE THINK THAT THE EXAMPLE GIVEN IS A PRIME REASON WHY. OF THIS BILL AND MANY OF THE PROVISIONS IN IT. SHOULD NOT BE THANK YOU. THANK. BUT YOU ANY OTHER MEMBERS THE PUBLIC I LIKE TO TESTIFY OPPOSITION THE AUTHORS BILL. SEEING NONE ANY QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE OF THE AUTHOR. MR MATHIS. WHOSE WEAPONS. MORE SO QUESTION FOR THE MYSTERY. IT IT SEEMS TO ME. THAT THIS ISN'T QUITE. FULLY COCKED AND IN MY. PROBLEM WITH MOVING LEGISLATION FOR IN LETTING MY SUPPORTER. IS HE IN ALMOST ALL THE IN IN ITS NOT NOT A PUN INTEND ON THIS ONE BUT THE MECHANICS I DON'T THINK YOU'RE QUITE THERE YET. AND WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT YOU KNOW AMENDMENTS ARE WE ONNA DO THESE THINGS. AND. YOU KNOW ALL THIS COMING LAST MINUTE I DON'T REALLY LIKE ME AND I I I LIKE HAVE A BETTER CHARTER CONVERSATION. SELL ON A LAYOFF TODAY. I DON'T WANT TO SUPPORT ANYTHING THAT MIGHT COME OFF AS A WOMAN. PUN INTENDED ON THAT ONE. BUT SOME ARE GONNA STAY OFF TODAY BUT I HOPE THAT. THESE ISSUES GET RESOLVED BETWEEN EVERYBODY SO THAT WE CAN ENSURE THAT. WE ARE PRODUCING GOOD CARS AND EVERYTHING'S GOING FORWARD EVERYBODY'S BEING TAKEN CARE OF AND ALL OF THOSE THINGS BUT I'D LIKE TO SEE IT. FINALLY TUNED. AND FIRING ON ALL CYLINDERS BEFORE WE KNOW IT THROUGHOUT THANK YOU. BUT SOMETHING IS. NO PANTS. PLAGUE YOU TRY TO AVOID. VERY GOOD ONES I ACTUALLY A QUESTION FOR BOTH SIDES AND FOR. THE IT IS THE AUTHOR OR EVERY TYPE TO ANSWER. THERE'S THAT. I'M IN I'M JUST MAKING SURE THAT I'M CLEAR ON WHAT'S IN AND OUT AFTER THE AMENDMENTS HAVE BEEN TAKEN. I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT THE REIMBURSEMENT RATE WHICH IS A BIG CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE TWO SIDES. FOR NON WARRANTY ITEMS. WILL SOMEHOW BE CONNECTED TO THE REIMBURSEMENT RATE FOR WARRANTY ITEMS. PERHAPS PUTTING A PRESSURE ON PAID DEALER SHIP TO. TO. INCREASE THEIR NON WARRANTY RETAIL ITEM. EITHER TO SUBSIDIZE OR OTHERWISE HAVE THE REIMBURSEMENT RATES CONNECTED. IS THAT THE CASE THAT THERE'S STILL CONNECTED AND IF SO WHY. SURE. GREAT QUESTION. SIMOUN BAKER SO HERE'S HOW IT WORKS. THE WAY IT WORKS NOW IN TWENTY SIX STATES AS THEY COME OUT MAY LOOK AT SPECIFICALLY WHAT THE READ TELL RATE IS AND EVALUATE THAT BASED UPON WARRANTY LIKE REPAIRS FOR VEHICLES. THAT NO LONGER ARE COVERED UNDER WARRANTY SO THIS IS JUST THE EXPIRED. WARRANTY IT'S IF YOU HAD YOUR WATER PUMP REPLACED YOUR FIRST THREE YEARS YOU'D BE COVERED UNDER WARRANTY. BUT AFTER THREE YEARS YOU WOULD NOT BE COVERED UP. SO WHAT WE DO IS WE USE THAT EXAMPLE OF THAT WARRANTY LIKE REPAIR FOR WHEN A CUSTOMER PAYS WE JUST USE THAT AND PUT IT ALL THAT INFORMATION TOGETHER WE. TAKE A WIDE SAMPLE OF A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT REPAIR ORDERS AND WE USE THAT REPAIR ORDER TODAY AND SAY THIS IS ESSENTIALLY WHAT THIS DEALER IS CHARGING FOR RETAIL. AND THEN THE OUT WE SUBMIT THAT TO THE AUTOMAKER IN THE AUTOMAKER HAS A PROCESS KNOWN THE REASON WHY THAT'S CONNECTED. IS BECAUSE. ALL OF THESE OTHER STATES HAVE DETERMINED AND WE DETERMINE AS WELL THAT IN OUR STATUTE THE LANGUAGE OF OUR STATUTES AS THE AUTOMAKER SHALL CONSIDER. OUR MAY CONSIDER. MAY CONSIDER THE RETAIL RATES FOR PARTS. THE PROBLEM IS WE HAVE SEEN ALMOST NO AUTO MAKER ACTUALLY CONSIDERING THAT WE. WHICH IS WHY FORTY OTHER STATES HAVE PASSED LAWS ST EACH YOU SHALL CONSIDER RETAIL RATES AND IN TWENTY SIX STATES COME OUT WITH THE METHODOLOGY. NOW. THEY'RE CONCERNED ABOUT AN INCREASE AND THE PRICE ON CONSUMERS. WE'RE NOT SEEN THAT TWENTY SIX OTHER STATES WE'VE TALKED TO OUR DEALERS IN THE TWENTY SIX OTHER STATES THAT'S NOT HAPPENING. AND FURTHERMORE THAT WOULD COMPLETELY IGNORE THE FACT THAT WE WORK IN A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE MARKET. NON WARRANTY REPAIRS ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE WITH THOSE INDEPENDENT REPAIR SHOP. SO YOU HAVE YOUR MOM AND POP GUYS DOWN THE STREET WHO ARE COMPETING AGAINST FRANCHISE NEW CAR DEALERS THEY DON'T HAVE AS MUCH OVERHEAD THEY DON'T HAVE THE SPECIALIZED TRAINING THEY DON'T HAVE THE. RIGHT TECHNICIANS BUT WE ARE COMPETING AGAINST THEM WHAT WE'VE ACTUALLY SEEN IN THESE OTHER STATES IS THAT RATE ON RETAIL HAS ACTUALLY. ROCKED LESS EXPENSIVE BECAUSE THE DEALERS CAN BE MORE COMPETITIVE BECAUSE THEY'RE GETTING RETAIL FROM THE AUTOMAKERS VERSES THEY'RE SUBSIDIZING. OKAY THAT ANSWER YOUR QUESTION IS DOES THIS EXACTLY WHEN I STOOD KNOWING THAT WAS THE NEXT QUESTION I HAD WAS IF YOU HAVE THAT BECAUSE IT'S A. WHAT THIS CAN DO TO CONSUMERS? IS ALSO PART MEET BASICALLY BE REALLY NICE IF IF THERE'S A LOT MORE ANIMOSITY THAN THERE HAS BEEN FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS INCOME IN THE COMMITTEE AT THIS STAGE BE NICE IF WE DIDN'T SEE IT. AND THIS IS WORKED OUT BUT MY ALSO TRYING TO DIGEST WHAT IS GONNA HAPPEN TO CONSUMERS IN MY COMMUNITY SO. IF I I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR THAT COUNTER IF YOU HAVE ONE IF THAT PUTS UP PRICE PRESSURE. IT WILL BE MUCH SHORTER. YES AND THE REASON I MUST IT IS BILLS QUALITATIVELY DIFFERENT FROM PRE PREDECESSORS. THE BILL PROHIBITS THE CONSIDERATION OF ANY DISCOUNTS. NEGOTIATED WITH GOVERNMENT INSURANCE RAINING THEY'VE PICKED THE HIGHEST RATE IN THAT IT THAT IN THE STATUTE. AND MAKE US PAY IT EVEN IF WE OBJECT WE HAVE TO PAY IT WHILE IT'S BEING LITIGATED IN FRONT OF THE NEW MOTOR VEHICLE BOARD. A PROCESSES FOR WHICH ARE DISTORTED UNDER THIS BILL. SO IT'S IT'S IT'S A BAD IDEA COMPOUNDED BY UNFAIRNESS. NOW THE NEXT ONE HAS TO DO WITH THE FIRST EXAMPLE MISTER IRVINE HAD AYE AYE AYE AND I THUMB PAGE THIRTY FOUR OF THE IDEA. THAT IF THIS BILL WERE TO PASS. A FACILITY WOULD NOT BE CHANGED. FOR TEN YEARS THEY HAVE NO REASON TO DO THAT. YEAH I READ THROUGH THE REST OF IT IN ITS UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH THAT'S THE CASE. TO ME I'M NOT SURE IF THESE ARE THE AMENDMENTS AFFECTED THIS PROVISION. I'M OF THE AUTHOR WANTS TO ADDRESS THAT AT THIS ONE STILL STAYS IN AFTER TODAY'S AMENDMENTS. OKAY. SO THAT'S THE CASE. I MEAN JUST IN FAIRNESS THE PARAGRAPH GOES ON. WITH A MUCH MORE NARROW CIRCUMSTANCES NOT THERE'S NOTHING IN TEN YEARS THAT'S ONLY IF AS I READ IT. YOU KNOW FOR MODIFICATION IS REQUIRED BY THE MANUFACTURER DOESN'T APPLY IF YOU SILLY ALTERATION IS NECESSARY TO ENABLE THE SERVICE OF THE ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES SO THERE'S SOME NARROWING. Y. WHEN THE NEW CAR DEALERS HAVE AN INCENTIVE YOUR ST STEEL AND ALUMINUM CAN'T DO IT TOGETHER DON'T THEY HAVE AN INCENTIVE. ALREADY WITHOUT THIS EVEN IF YOU'RE READING IT IS NEARLY AS YOU IT PROPOSED. TO TAKE CARE OF THIS IF IT NEEDS TO BE DONE MORE FREQUENTLY THAN TEN YEARS. I READ IT AS A DISJUNCTIVE THEY'VE ELIMINATED ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES YOU ARE CORRECT. WHICH IS AN ADMISSION THAT THEY WERE PREVIOUSLY CAPTURED BY. SO CLEARLY ANYTHING ELSE IS CAPTURED. BY EXCLUDING ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES. SO WE S. WOULD THEY SHOULD HAVE AN INCENTIVE YOU'RE ACTUALLY RIGHT THEY SHOULD BE LEADING THE EFFORT TO DEPLOY THESE VEHICLES AS OPPOSED TO RESISTING IT. WE INTERPRET THIS. READ THE TEXT WE ARE RANDOM HELD THEM TO DO SOMETHING MORE OFTEN THAN EVERY. AND YEARS EXCEPT AS RELATES TO ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES THE ALUMINUM EXEMPTION AND AND SOME OF THE OTHER ISSUES ARE NOT ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES NECESSARILY IF WE COULD BE THE STANDARD INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE. THANK YOU I I THINK WERE. THESE ARE THE KIND OF DETAILS THAT REALLY I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THIS CONTINUE THE BILL THE STAY ALIVE SO THAT YOU CAN BE DOING THIS KNOWING THAT ANYONE OF US COULD. YOU KNOW SEE WHAT ULTIMATELY COMES BEFORE US ON THE FLOOR BE DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WE SUPPORT TODAY. AND AND I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT WHAT IT WHATEVER. SCANNED THEM LECTURE BUT WHATEVER THE ANIMOSITY IS YOU HAVE THE CAPACITOR US NOT TO BE ABLE TO GET SOMETHING SENSIBLE TO US. BUT THESE ARE TWO PARTICULAR PROVISIONS FOR EXAMPLE THAT YOU ARE THAT SHOULD BE YOU CAN AGREE JUST BY LOOKING AT THE TEXT OR OTHERWISE AND DON'T SO. KEEP WORKING ON IT AND I HOPE THAT WILL HAPPEN AFTER TODAY. THANK YOU WITHOUT A DOUBT THEY WILL. THE DISCUSSION IS GOING TO HAVE TO CONTINUE. ON IT DID BEGAN AND ALTHOUGH THERE HASN'T BEEN LOTS OF DISCUSSION THERE HAS BEEN SUFFICIENT TO LET US KNOW WHICH OF THE PROVISIONS WERE. OBJECTIONABLE AND SO THERE WERE. AMENDMENTS THAT WERE TAKEN BY THE DEALERS. MR FROM THAT I HAVE MS FREEMAN. I'LL BE BRIEF. I GUESS MY COMMENTS ARE MADE DIPPED TO BOTH SIDES. I'VE I'VE HAD SIGNIFICANT CONVERSATIONS. I WHICHEVER FRAZIER ON THIS ON THIS PARTICULAR BILL HAVE HEARD FROM MY LOCAL DEALERSHIPS. A VERY SUPPORT OF THIS BILL I'D CERTAINLY ALL OUR LOCAL DEALERSHIPS ARE SIGNIFICANT PART OF OUR LOCAL ECONOMY. THE KERN COUNTY. BUT CLEARLY. THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS AND I REMAIN AND I BELIEVE THESE ISSUES ULTIMATELY NEED TO BE NEGOTIATED BY BOTH PARTIES IN ORDER TO ENSURE THE BEST POSSIBLE OUTCOME BOTH MANUFACTURERS. AND THE DEALERSHIPS NEED TO WORK TOGETHER AND LIGHT OF THE CHANGING ECONOMY THAT WE LITERALLY LIVE IN AND HOW SERVICES ARE BEING DELIVERED. AND AS THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD. I STRONGLY URGE BOTH SIDES TO COME TOGETHER AND I WILL WORK CLOSELY WHICH EVAN FRAZIER TO ENSURE THAT THIS NEGOTIATION OCCURS IN GOOD FAITH BRING FORWARD SOME. I MUCH THANK YOU MAY THINK YOU BUSTER. MS FREEMAN. THANK YOU. I JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT I AM GOING TO SUPPORT THIS TODAY BECAUSE I THINK THAT THIS CONVERSATION NEEDS TO CONTINUE BUT ALWAYS ARE MY RIGHT AND. WHEN IT COMES TO THE FLOOR I HOPE THAT YOU DO VERY ABLE TO WORK OUT SOME OF THESE ISSUES THANK YOU. METRIC UNITS IT'S AN IMPORTANT BILL THAT REQUIRES. DIALOGUE BETWEEN BOTH OF BETWEEN ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS THIS BUT PRIMARILY THE MANUFACTURERS AND THE NEW CAR DEALERS I THINK AS LONG AS WE CONTINUE THAT CONVERSATION. WITHOUT A DOUBT WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE A ON THE FLOOR A BILL THAT. HOPEFULLY YOU ALL ARE GOING TO. REALIZES A. GOOD ONE TO VOTE ON. MISTER CHIU. ALRIGHT THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR A BRAIN DOES. VERY COMPLICATED GET. A BILL FOR IN I THINK IT VERY MUCH COOLER HAVE A VERY OPEN MIND AND BE ABLE TO CONTINUE THE DISCUSSION I THINK THIS IS A. THIS IS TO FIRST COMMITTEE. SO WE TRIED THAT OUT AS MUCH AS WE CAN AND. ON CONFIDENCE WANTS TO BILLS MOVE FORWARD WILL HAVE A MORE. I COMPROMISED BETWEEN THE TWO OF A JUST ONE QUESTION QUICK QUESTION REGARDING TO THE. COST CONSUMER PROTECTION. I DON'T KNOW YOU HAVE TAKING ANY AMENDMENT OVER THE WEEKEND THE DISCRETION WAS DEVELOPED BEFORE THE WEEKEND. IS SAID TO YOU IF THE DEALER CAN USE ANY PARTS THEY WANT AND IF THERE ARE NO CONSUMER SURVEY. THEN IF TO DEALERS NOT OBLIGATED TO FIX RECALL RECALL OF VEHICLES TO THE MANUFACTURER'S SPECIFICATION AND SUBJECT TO DEAR OVERSIGHT. AND THE DAYS COULD AID RESOLVING THE LAST SAFETY FOR THE CONSUMER. AND ARE WE GOING GO MOVING FOR ARE WE GOING TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. ABSOLUTELY AND MISTER CHAIRMAN MAY I HAVE. THE SPONSOR RESPOND TO THAT. I TRY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. MISTER ISSUE I THINK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR QUESTION. I MEAN. A LITTLE CONFUSEDBY YOUR QUESTION FRANKLY WE DON'T SEE ANYWHERE IN THE BILL WHERE WE PROHIBIT. THE MANUFACTURERS DICTATING TO DEALERS HOW WE NEED TO DO A REPAIR AS IT RELATES TO RECALLS ARE ANY OTHER TYPE OF WARRANTY REPAIRS WE DON'T CHANGE THE VERY NATURE OF WHAT THE REPAIRS ARE. ALL WE DO IS. CHANGE HOW WE ARE REIMBURSED FROM THE AUTOMAKERS. OR A GREAT THANKS FOR THE CLARIFICATION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE. CLICK ON ONE OR TWO OF US LEFT. MS REYES WAS LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. AND AGAIN I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE INTEREST OF HIS AT YOU IN THIS BILL AND AT THAT THE COMMITTEES. INPUT OUR END TODAY I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE TO ALLOW US TO CONTINUE OUR DISCUSSION WITH STAKEHOLDERS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISS RINGS. SO FIRST OF ALL I'D LIKE TO COMMEND BOTH OF THE SPONSORS AND IN THEIR THEIR REPRESENTATIVES FOR. ABSOLUTE OWNING IN KNOWING THE BILL. IT'S REFRESHING. OF AND MIGHT HAVE TWO DIFFERENT VIEWPOINTS. DIFFERENT PHILOSOPHIES BUT AT LEAST YOU CAN ANSWER THE QUESTIONS GLARINGLY. SO. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE THIS REYES. ACCEPTING THE COMMAND COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS. AND I WILL BE SUPPORTING YOUR BILL TODAY. AS I TOLD BOTH PARTIES. TO WORK IT OUT. AND I FULLY EXPECT THOSE PARTIES TO CONTINUE. THIS COMMITTEES URGING. TO CONTINUE A DIALOGUE GOING FORWARD I DIDN'T WANT IT TO END UP. IN THIS COMMITTEE. HOWEVER. HE DID. MANY OF THE PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL ARE OVERLY BROAD. ALL OTHERS UNFAIRLY STACKED THE DECK AGAINST AUTO MANUFACTURERS. FOR EXAMPLE CARMINA FACTORS A REQUIRED TO PAY THE RETAIL LABOR AND PARTS RATING LESS THE NEW MOTOR VEHICLE BOARD FINDS REYES MATERIALLY. INACCURATE. HOWEVER YOUR BILL BARS METAFICTION IS FROM REQUESTING AN AUDIT. ON HOW THOSE RATES WERE CALCULATED. FURTHER IF THE BOARD DOES FIND% THE RATE WAS INACCURATE THE BILL PROVIDES NO REMEDIES. TWO THE MANUFACTURES WHO REQUIRED TO PAY UNFAIR RATES WHILE PROVIDING REMEDIES TO DEALERS IF MANUFACTURERS REFUSE TO PAY. SO LOCAL EQUITY PROBLEM HERE. THANK I URGE BOTH PARTIES AGAIN TO WORK TOGETHER TO CONTINUE TO NEGOTIATE I APPRECIATE. THUS FAR THIS BILL GETTING DOWN TO THIS POINT. I WILL RESERVE MY RIGHT. TO VOTE ON THIS BILL. I FLOORED IT ON THE FLOOR OF CHANGES ARE MADE OR OF ANY DRAMATIC CHANGES GO BACK THE OTHER DIRECTION I WILL PULL THIS BILL BACK INTO THIS COMMITTEE SO FAST. PEOPLE SAYS WOULD SPEND.

WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE THE OTHER BONE MARROW MISTER TRAYNOR MISTER MON WE DO HAVE SECOND ITEMS ARE AT LEX? RUTHIE PLEASE GO AHEAD AND. PRESENT UNITS BILL BUT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR A. B. TWENTY SEVEN SIXTY ONE WOULD CLARIFY WHAT A MOTORIST A. BICYCLIST OR SOMEONE ON A MOTORCYCLE SHOULD DO IF A SIGNAL IS AN OPERATIVE. I'M SURE WEEK YOU'RE ALL AWARE OF THE FACT THAT I MANY SIGNALS ARE CONTROLLED BY SOME KIND OF AUTOMATION USED TO BE LOOP SENSORS IN THE STREET THAT WOULD DETECT THE PRESENCE OF. LARGE MASSES OF METAL AND IDENTIFY THAT THE TO THE SIGNAL THAT THERE WAS SOMEONE WAITING. NOW TO ENTER THE INTERSECTION OF I'M SORRY BUT MISTER CHAIR. CLARIFICATION FROM COMMITTEE THIS IS INFORMATIONAL ONLY I WILL BE ENTERTAINING THEM EMOTIONAL MR OBERNOLTE SPELL. PLEASE PROCEED THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR UP SO OF MODERN INCARNATIONS OF THIS USE CAMERAS WITH. TECHNOLOGY THAT ATTEMPTS TO IDENTIFY WHETHER OR NOT A MOTORIST A BICYCLIST FOR SOMEONE ON A MOTORCYCLE IS. WAITING TO ENTER THE INTERSECTION SO THE QUESTION IS WHAT HAPPENS WHAT SHOULD A MOTORIST DO IF THIS TECHNOLOGY IS NOT WORKING SO I CAN TELL YOU ANYONE AS A VICE WAS MYSELF ANYONE WHO'S A BICYCLIST OR RIDES A MOTORCYCLE. I'M SURE IS HEADED HAPPEN WHERE THE SIGNAL FAILED TO RECOGNIZE THAT YOU'RE SITTING THERE AND IN LESS THERE'S SOME KIND OF TIMING ASSOCIATED WITH A SIGNAL LOGIC YOU WILL JUST SIT THERE WERE FOREVER. WAITING FOR THE SIGNAL DIRECT TO RECOGNIZE YOU AND THIS ALSO IS A PROBLEM WITH THE NEWEST GENERATION OF CAMERA. EQUIPPED SIGNALS SO. WITH ME TO TESTIFY ON THE BILL. GOOD MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS CAN MEET JAMES LOMBARDA ON BEHALF OF BETA CALIFORNIA MOTORCYCLE RIDERS ORGANIZATION. AND A CABLE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION BICYCLE ORGANIZATIONS I LAST YEAR YOU PASSED OUT OF FULLER BILL. I THINK WAS S. B. SIX NINETY FIVE THAT EXTENDED THE SUNSET AND SAID THAT. AS A CITIES AND COUNTIES AND STATES. CALTRANS DOES. ROAD WORK ON INTERSECTIONS THAT THEY WILL THEN REPLACE THE CENTERS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY PICK UP MOTORCYCLES AND BICYCLES. THIS BILL AS A FOLLOW UP BECAUSE HAVE WE'D LIKE TO GET SOME IDEA FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT BECAUSE WHAT LAW ENFORCEMENT SAYS UNLESS THERE IS NO. ELECTRICITY AND THE LIGHT IS BLACK. YOU CANNOT PERCY. AND THAT IS VERY DANGEROUS FOR US TO BE AN INTERSECTION TRYING TO MAKE THAT TURN WAY THROUGH TWO OR THREE. OF LIFE CHANGES YOUR AYE AND ALL LEATHER. AB BOOTS HELMET. AND IT'S A HUNDRED AND FIVE DEGREES IN AND BAKERSFIELD USE THAT THERE FOR A HALF HOUR YOU'LL BE DEAD. SO THAT'S WHY WE HAVE THIS BILL HERE TO SEE. NINETEEN. OHIO JUST PASSED A BILL LAST YEAR DATA THAT SAID WE COULD DIE. GO FORWARD WHEN I HAS CYCLE TWICE IT HAS IT. PICKED US UP THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU YOU KNOW DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER WITNESSES THERE. WANTING TO TESTIFY AS WELL SUPPORT OF THIS HA HEARING. HEARING OF THIS BILL. CAME MEMBERS THE PUBLIC THAT LIKE TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION OR. CONCERNS WITH THE BILL. YES MISTER CHAIRMAN NOW MICHAEL GUNNING PERSONAL INSURANCE FEDERATION REPRESENTING AUTO INSURERS. YOU KNOW RIGHT NOW LAWS VERY CLEAR. IN FACT THE STATUTES SAY THAT. IF THE SIGNALS OUT. YOU HAVE TO ACT LIKE IT'S A STOP SIGN. WE'RE CONCERNED BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO DETERMINE WHO'S AT FAULT IN AN ACCIDENT AND IF WE HAVE SOMEONE WHO SAYS. HAY IN ALL THE LIGHT WAS BROKE I TURNED AND SOMEONE WHO SAYS THE LIGHT WAS RED. THIS IS GOING TO CAUSE DISRUPTION IN CONFUSION IN THE MARKETPLACE PARTICULARLY ON THE ROAD HUESO IN THE FRANKLY IN THE INTEREST OF SAFETY. WE WOULD OPPOSE THIS MEASURE IF WE'RE BEING VOTED ON TODAY. THANK YOU NICK BIGGER PLEASED WHICH NAME HE REPRESENTING PLEASE CATERPILLAR ABOUT AMERICAN INSURANCE ASSOCIATION ON LIKE TO LINE MY COMMENTS WITH THEM MISTER GUNNING. A IS A MOTORCYCLE RIDER I ACTUALLY DO APPRECIATE HIM TIME TO DO BUT. I HAVE CONCERNS. I THINK THIS IS THE FIRST DURING THE MISS HEADING BONE HAS BEEN IN OUR. OUR COMMITTEE SAYS SHE'S BEEN MARRIED CONGRATULATIONS. MISTER OBERNOLTE IS IT IS A QUESTIONS OF. IN HIS COMMITTEE. MISTER HARPER OF COURSE. THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO ASK A QUESTION OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. DO WE HAVE LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THE HOUSE MISTER DESMARAIS SEASON BACK WAY BACK IN THE BACK. YOU CAN START QUESTIONING NOW BY THE TIME HISTORY MIGHT BE READY TO ANSWER ABSOLUTELY MISTER CHAIR. YOU KNOW I'VE I'VE BEEN IN THIS SITUATION YOU KNOW MYSELF BY IN A CAR I USED TO HAPPEN ALL THE TIME YOU KNOW IN A IS A TEENAGER MY TWENTIES BUT IS A TECHNOLOGY SAID HAS ADVANCED. THAT HAPPENS FARM FAR ABOVE FORM FOR LESS NICK IMAGINE OF EVEN GREATER FOR SMALL OF VEHICLES AYE SUCH AS MOTORCYCLES OR BICYCLISTS. IMPACT IS RECENTLY IS A IS A IS A YEAR AGO I HAD A SITUATION WHERE. A THE A LEFT HAND. TURNS. YOU KNOW GREEN. EVEN THOUGH IT KEPT CYCLING THROUGH NEVER WENT TO GREEN SO THE QUESTION I HAVE IS ESPECIALLY IN A SITUATION THAT'S BROUGHT FORWARD HERE. IN YOU'RE TRYING TO CROSS THE INTERSECTION AND IT DOESN'T GO GREEN AS THE DRIVER. WHAT ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO DO ACCORDING TO LAW? SO I. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN WAS THE KILLER. MY ASSISTANT ASSISTANT CHIEF RICHARD ON WITH THE CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL. WE DO NOT HAVE AN OFFICIAL POSITION ON THIS HAVE NOT TALKING THE MINISTRATION. NOR HAVE WE BEEN CONTACTED BY THE AUTHORS OFFICE ABOUT THIS BILL. SAYS REALLY TURNS FEDERATION FOLKS MENTIONED YOU TREAT IF IF THE IF THE LIGHT IS NOT FUNCTIONING. WHAT TYPICALLY HAPPENS IS SOMEONE TREATS IT AS IF I IT JUST A FOUR WAY STOP SIGN? AND YOU WAY TO GO THROUGH. THE OTHER THING YOU CAN CERTAINLY DO. IN THIS SITUATION IS MAKE A RIGHT HAND TURN. AFTER COME TO STOP MAKE A RIGHT HAND TURN. AND THEN SOMEHOW FIGURE OUT ANOTHER WAY TO MAKE YOUR LEAD TO PROCEED ON YOUR ROUTE. I'M ALSO MOTORCYCLE RIDER. ALTHOUGH WE DON'T HAVE A POSITION ON THE BILL WE DO CERTAINLY HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE STANDARD IN THE BILL THAT WOULD JUST REQUIRE SOME TO WAIT A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME. AND ECHO THE STATEMENT OF THE INSURANCE. LOBBYIST WHAT IS A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT FROM FROM THE STANDPOINT OF ENFORCEMENT AFTER THE SAMPLING OF OF VEHICLE COLLISION INVESTIGATE. SO WE THINK THE POTENTIAL. TRAFFIC SAFETY ISSUES. CERTAINLY OUTWEIGH ANY. CONVENIENCE I THINK THAT WOULD BE ACHIEVED BY SOMETHING LIKE MISTER I TO POLITICS TO TRY TO CLARIFY THAT. ON. YEAH IF YOU COULD HELP ME WITH NOT FUNCTIONING BECAUSE IN THE IN THE SCENARIO IS THERE DESCRIBED. IN THAT I'M ALLUDING TO AYE IT'S THAT THE GREEN ISN'T COMING FORWARD I TO ME THERE COULD BE A DEFINITIONAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN. YOU KNOW THE POWER LINES ARE DOWN THE POWERS OUR RIGHTS JUST FLASHING REGISTERED LIKE THAT. IT IS IT CONSIDERED NON FUNCTIONING IF THE GREEN ISN'T CYCLING THROUGH. THERE COULD BE SITUATIONS WHERE MIGHT BE ABOUT HOW HOW WOULD WE KNOW THAT AT THE TIME HOW THE MOTORCYCLES YOU KNOW THAT AT THE TIME AND THAT'S WHY THE BILL THE STANDARD THE BILL REASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME. IS NOT THAT SAME STANDARD AS NOT FUNCTIONING AND THAT'S WHERE SOME OF THE CONFUSION WOULD COME AND IT WILL MAKE THIS DIFFICULT. TO BOTH IN FORCE AND TO USE AS A. FACTOR IN INVESTIGATING A COLLISION. IN ON I KNOW THERE SHOULD BE A RARE SITUATION. BUT THE SCENARIO OF TAKING A RIGHT HAND TURN I COULD BE VERY PROBLEMATIC INTO SITUATIONS ONE IF THERE'S NO U. TURNS ALLOWED ON THE OTHER SIDE FOR QUITE SOME TIME. BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY BE TRAPPED IF THERE WASN'T BOND NO RIGHT TURN ON RED SUCH. RIGHT THERE ARE THAT'S NOT NOT IT'S CERTAINLY NOT A PERFECT SOLUTION. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN FOR ALLOWING THIS QUESTIONS THIS ORDER CAN BE OTHER QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE OF. THE AUTHOR BOTH THOSE CITIES APPEAR. SEEING NONE MISTER OBERNOLTE WOULD LIKE CLOSE TALK I THINK MISTER JERICHO CLEARLY WE HAVE SOME MORE WORK TO DO ON THIS THAT IS WHY I ASKED YOU NOT TO BRING UP FOR A VOTE AT THIS TIME. SOARING TO KEEP WORKING ON THIS ISSUE BUT I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT CLARIFY WHAT WE EXPECT. OF MOTORISTS AND BICYCLISTS AND MOTORCYCLISTS IN CALIFORNIA AND I WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS ISSUE. JUST JUST TO POINT OUT WE LEFT THE. DEFINITION OF REASONABLE WITTY PRETTY VAGUE WHEN WE WROTE THE BILL BECAUSE WE INTENDED TO. TO. YEAH A TUNNEL DOWN ON THAT AS WE AS THE BILL WENT THROUGH THE PROCESS SORT OF INTENTIONAL BE TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING THAT IS COMPLETELY EMPIRICAL Y. CONCERT NUMBER CYCLES OF THE LIGHT. FOR CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME THAT ELAPSES* BEEN DONE IN OTHER STATES OR IF. IF THE OUTCOME IS THAT. IF YOU'RE ON A BICYCLE AND YOU NEVER GET TO READ THAT YOU SHOULD DISMOUNT IN CROSS TWO LANES OF TRAFFIC TO GET TO THE INTERSECTION I THINK WHEN YOU LET PEOPLE KNOW THAT AND SO WE SHOULD CHANGE THE CODE. TO TO REFLECT THAT FACT AS WELL I JUST TRY TO CLARIFY WHAT WE EXPECTED PEOPLE IN THAT SITUATION BUT I THINK YOU FOR INDULGENCE MISTER CHAIR WILL CONTINUE WORKING ON THE BILL. LIKE YOU MISTER OBERNOLTE AND I QUESTION THE LOGIC OF PROVIDING LEGAL DEFENSE FOR ONE OF THE MOST DANGEROUS VIOLATIONS OF THE RULES OF THE ROAD. WHEN TECHNOLOGICAL SOLUTIONS ARE AVAILABLE. ALSO STATES HAVE PASSED LAWS TO ADDRESS ISSUE YOU HAVE RAISED THOSE LAWS WERE LIMITED TO BICYCLES MOTORCYCLES AND BETTER DEFINED WITH SOMEONE COULD RENTAL REDLIGHT. HOWEVER EVEN THEN SUCH LANGUAGE CAN MAKE IT HARDER TO PROVE RED LIGHT VIOLATIONS. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WILL LOOK AT GOING FORWARD IS IS HOPEFULLY CAN WORK WITH THE HIGHWAY PATROL AND OTHER PUBLIC SAFETY TO DRESCHER CONCERNS. BUT FOR ME ALWAYS THE PUBLIC SAFETY TAKES PRECEDENCE IN ANY SITUATION GOING FORWARD. WITH THAT THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR PRESENTING IT WILL MOVE FORWARD TO MISTER THANK YOU MISTER LOAN FOR SURE THEY THANK THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS. MR ONLY BE PRESENTING AB TWENTY TWO TWENTY FOUR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. BEFORE I PRESENT AB TWENTY TWENTY FOUR I WANT TO SAY THAT I HEARD THE CONCERNS RELATED TO SAFETY STANDARDS AND LANE SPLITTING PRIOR TO LAST WEEK'S HEARING. AND WITH THE INPUT FROM THE BILL'S SUPPORTERS AND THE COMMITTEE CONSULTANTS IN BOTH CAUCUSES WE'VE CRAFTED AMENDMENTS. THAT I'M HAPPY TO ACCEPT TODAY TO MOVE THE BILL FORWARD AB TWENTY TWO TWENTY FOUR IS A BILL TO INCENT TO PRODUCTION. AND USE OF NARROW TRACKED VEHICLES IN CALIFORNIA BY GRANTING THEM HOV LANE ACCESS IN THE SAME PARKING ACCESS THAT MOTORCYCLES ENJOY. HE'S VEHICLES ALSO KNOWN AS AND TV'S ARE THE SIZE OF MOTORCYCLES BUT PROVIDE BETTER SAFETY FEATURES AND. AS THEY TEND TO BE POWERED BY ELECTRIC OR HYBRID ENGINES ARE MORE EFFICIENT. I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY OF YOU TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY TO TEST DRIVE THE NTV'S THAT WERE A SITTING OUT FRONT OF THE CAPITOL A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO BUT. I KNOW THAT SEVERAL COMMITTEE MEMBERS HAVE GERMAN THEM IN THE PAST AS HAVE I. IT'S A GOOD RIDE AND FRANKLY I WAS PLEASANTLY SURPRISED THAT EVEN I COULD FIT IN ONE COMFORTABLY. MY STAFF WROTE THAT I THINK THEY'RE REFERRING TO MY HEIGHT. NOT ENTIRELY SURE. SO MY INTEREST IN THE BILL IS STRAIGHTFORWARD WE HAVE A SEVERE CONGESTION PROBLEM ON OUR STREETS. AND HIGHWAYS AND SEVERE PARKING SHORTAGES IN URBAN COMMUNITIES. AND WHILE THERE ARE MANY CONTRIBUTING FACTORS TO THESE PROBLEMS NINE IS AS OBVIOUS AS THE USE OF SINGLE OCCUPANT VEHICLES. THAT ARE INTENDED TO MOVE FOUR OR FIVE PEOPLE AT A TIME. ALONG WITH THE CHAIR MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE HAVE SUPPORTER WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT A VARIETY OF TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS THAT MOVE PEOPLE MORE EFFICIENTLY. AND TV'S FIT THAT MOLD BY OFFERING CONSUMERS AN OPTION THAT CAN REDUCE TRAFFIC CONGESTION PARKING SCARCITY. FOSSIL FUEL CONSUMPTION AND POLLUTION. THIS BILL CAN SEND A POSITIVE SIGNAL TO THE MARKETPLACE OF BOTH SMALL AND MAJOR AUTO MANUFACTURERS THAT ARE CONSIDERING VEHICLES IN THE SPACE WILL BRING THEM TO MARKET AND POTENTIALLY HELP REDUCE THE NUMBER OF LARGE SINGLE OCCUPANT VEHICLES. ON OUR ROADWAYS AND I HAVE WITNESSES HERE WITH ME AND SUPPORT. A PLEASE PROCEED. GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS OF PHILIPPE IF WINTERS HERE ON BEHALF OF THE NARROW TRACK VEHICLE ASSOCIATION THANK YOU FOR. YOUR ATTENTION IN THIS MATTER I ALSO WANT TO THANK SOME OF THEM ARE MULLIN FOR CARRYING THE BILL THE BILL SIMPLY DOES THREE THINGS IT ESTABLISHES A CLASS. OF NARROW TRACK SHERPA SHORT TRACK VEHICLES INTO DEFINES THEM NOT BEING LONGER THAN A HUNDRED AND TWO INCHES AND IN THE CASE OF A SHORT TRACK VEHICLE. NOT A ANY LONGER THAN A HUNDRED AND TWO INCHES. NO WIDER THAN FORTY INCHES I'M SORRY NO WIDER THAN FORTY INCHES NO LONGER THAN HUNDRED AND TWO INCHES. IT ALSO MAKES IT SO THAT THESE VEHICLES WOULD BE PERMISSIBLE IN. HOV LANES AND LASTLY WHAT IT DOES IT A ASK LOCAL GOVERNMENT THAT REGULATES. MOTORCYCLE PARKING TO CONSIDER THESE VEHICLES IN THE SAME WAY AND AGAIN. THE THE MEASURE ITS INTENTION HERE IS TO FIGURE OUT HOW IT IS THAT WE HAVE ADOPTION OF OTHER SOLUTIONS. TO RELIEVE SOME OF THE CONGESTION AND THE CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE TODAY ON THE BUILT INFRASTRUCTURE AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE HAS ANY. I THINK YOU A MUCH ARE THERE ANY OTHER MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC THAT LIKE TO SPEAK IN FAVOR OF THIS BILL. SEEING NONE ANY OF THOSE WANT TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE EITHER ANY MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ELECT. A SIMILAR TREATMENT. I HAVE A QUESTION. I'M. COURSE VERY INTRUSIVE AND LISTENS TO CONGESTION. AS I REPRESENT LOS ANGELES. YES. ALSO UP I AM VERY INTERESTED IN SOLUTIONS A CONGESTION LIVING IN LOS ANGELES. BUT GIVEN THAT THE THERE'S NO PROPOSAL TO ALLOW SEVERAL OF THESE VEHICLES TO SHARE THE LANE. THEY'RE STILL WRITING. ONE BY ONE. I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THIS HELPS WITH THE CONGESTION ISSUE I CAN SEE HOW WOULD MIGHT HELP WITH THE PARKING ISSUE. BUT IN TERMS OF ROAD CONGESTION IF YOU STILL HAVE TO HAVE THEM ONE CAR AFTER ANOTHER. AND SINCE THEY DON'T THEY HOLD ONE PERSON. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY CREATING MORE SPACE THAT YOU NEED FOR THESE VEHICLES. RATHER THAN TRYING TO HAVE VEHICLES THAT LIKE BUSES THAT CARRY A LOT OF PEOPLE. SO COULD YOU EXPLAIN THAT. I'M SURE PLUS FUND HAS WANT TO COMMENT ON THAT LET ME JUST SAY THAT WE ARE PROVIDING ANOTHER OPTION FOR MOTORISTS OTHER THAN LARGE. SUV'S AND AND AND BIGGER VEHICLES AND LIKE THE QUESTION AROUND. A LANE SPLITTING WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE. CHP ON THAT QUESTION AND WE'RE GOING TO BE DEFERRED THE CHP ON THE SAFETY PIECE BUT THAT IS A LITTLE BIT OF AN OF AN OPEN ISSUE BUT I'M GONNA LET MISTER POINT HAS COMMENT IF YOU WELL. GREAT THANK YOU SOME A MEMBER FRIEDMAN FOR THE QUESTION SO THE ANALYSIS I THINK DOES A VERY GOOD JOB IN HIGHLIGHTING SOME OF THE CHALLENGES OF THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT DID SUGGEST THAT SOME POINT. WE MAY HAVE TO RE STRIKE FREEWAYS I THINK THE REALITY IS IS THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO SEE ANY LARGER OR MORE CAPACITY BUILT IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE SO THE QUESTION BECOMES. HOW WAS IT THAT WE GET TO SOLUTIONS WHERE WE MAXIMIZE WHAT IT IS THAT'S CURRENTLY BILLS? THESE VEHICLES I MENTION ARE NO WIDER THAN FORTY INCHES AND THE CASE OF THE SHORT TRACK VEHICLE NO LONGER THAN A HUNDRED AND TWO INCHES. SO EVEN AGAINST MY LEAF THIS VEHICLE IS A LITTLE BIT SMALLER THAN THE ONE THAT I CURRENTLY DRIVE SO THERE WILL BE SOME NATURAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR THESE VEHICLES TO TAKE. MORE OF THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT AND ACTUALLY GET MORE RIDERS IN PLACE. BUT THE REALITY OF THE MATTER IS THAT THESE VEHICLES FOR THEM TO BE IN PRODUCTION THE NEAR FUTURE THIS IS PROBABLY THREE TO FIVE MAYBE EVEN EIGHT YOU'RE A VENTURE BEFORE WE SEE THESE COME TO SCALE. AT THAT POINT I THINK YOU'LL SEE OPPORTUNITIES LIKE AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES AND THE ABILITY FOR THESE VEHICLES TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THOSE TYPES OF TECHNOLOGIES SO I THINK THEY'LL JIGSAW THEM WAY THEIR WAY BACK INTO A WAY WHERE WILL MAXIMIZE. WHAT IS THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE BUILT IT'S JUST AN OPPORTUNITY HERE TO PROVIDE INCENTIVES FOR PEOPLE TO LOOK AT SOMETHING OTHER THAN WHAT IS CURRENTLY THE ISSUE WHICH IS? MULTI PASSENGER VEHICLES WHERE YOU JUST SEE ONE PERSON. DRIVING. WELL I UNDERSTAND IN THE IN THE FUTURE WHEN WE'RE ALL DRIVING THESE IF YOU HAVE LANE SITTERS REESE RIGHT FOR THEM. THEN I COULD SEE THEM MAKING A DIFFERENCE FOR CONGESTION AND I CERTAINLY HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH PEOPLE WRITING IN THEM AS LONG AS THEY'RE SAFE. BUT TO THEN SAY THAT THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO UC HOV LANE WHEN THEY'RE ONLY CARRYING ONE PERSON IN THERE. NOT REDUCING CONGESTION BECAUSE THEY'RE STILL HAVE TO BE THE SAME. LINK BETWEEN VEHICLES THAT DOES THAT PART DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE TO ME. SO THAT'S THAT'S THE ISSUE THAT I HAVE RIGHT NOW SURE AND AND THE I THINK AGAIN. THANK YOU FOR FOR THE ANALYSIS I THINK THE BILL POINTS OUT TO A PIECE OF LEGISLATION AUTHORED BY MYSELF THAT ACTUALLY HAD THREE WHEELED FULLY ENCLOSED VEHICLES TO BE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE TOBY LANE. AND THESE VEHICLES HE ONE QUESTION THEY ASK IS HOW MANY PASSENGERS WERE THE ONES THAT WE'VE SEEN THAT ARE BEING BETA TESTED WHETHER IT'S FROM ALPHA MORT MOTORS. OR FROM NISSAN ARE FROM TOYOTA OR FROM COMMUTER CARS IS THAT YOU HAVE. THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE TWO PASSENGERS PER VEHICLE. ARE THERE ANY OF THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE TO HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. AS HE NUMBER OF PROJECTS CLOSE. THANK YOU THOSE QUICKER I THOUGHT OF HIM. SIR VICE CHAIR OF. ME TO SAY THAT MY GOAL IS. THAT WE CREATE A POSITIVE SIGNAL TO THE MARKETPLACE THAT CALIFORNIA WILL CONTINUE TO BE INNOVATIVE IN THIS SPACE SO WITH REGARD TO OUR THINKING OUR RULE MAKING. ON A WHOLE RANGE OF MOBILITY ISSUES AND LOOKING FOR TO. WORKING WITH THE CHP ANOTHER SOB MOVING FORWARD AND I HOPE. THAT WE CAN. MAKE THAT POSITIVE SIGNAL TO THAT MARKETPLACE AND WITH THAT I ASK FOR MY VOTE. I THINK WE MUCH WE HAVE A MOTION BY MISTER CHIU TO HAVE SECOND. A SECOND MISTER BERMAN THE MAPS ACTIVITIES HURDLE. THE MOTION IS DO PASS AS AMENDED TO THE ASSEMBLY APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. FRAZIER. FONG FONG AYE AGUIAR-CURRY. BAKER. BERMAN. BERMAN AYE CHU. CHU AYE DALY. FRIEDMAN. GET FRIEDMAN AYE GIPSON. HARPER. HARPER NO MATHIS. MEDINA. MEDINA AYE NAZARIAN. O'DONNELL. O'DONNELL I. VOTE IS SIX THE WONDERFUL HOPE THE VOTERS. A MISCREANT. WE HAVE YOU. LISTED AT FILE ITEM EIGHT AB TWENTY THREE EIGHTY ONE. FEEL FREE TO PRESENT WHEN YOU'RE READY. GOOD AFTERNOON WITH MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M HERE TO PERCENT AB TWENTY THREE EIGHTY ONE A BILL THAT HELPS THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCE POOR OR THE AIR BE. IN THE FIGHT AGAINST VEHICLE TECHNOLOGY DESIGNED TO EVADE CALIFORNIA'S CLEAN AIR LAWS. NEW MOTOR VEHICLES ARE SUBJECT TO EMISSION TEST BY THE AIR BE TO VERIFY COMPLIANCE. WITH CALIFORNIA EMISSION LAWS. HOWEVER DEVICES EXIST THAT CAN ENABLE A VEHICLE TO FOOL. THE EMISSIONS TESTING. IN A PROMINENT EXAMPLE IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT VOLKSWAGEN HAD INSTALLED THE SO CALLED DEFEAT DEVICES. AND MANY OF THEIR VEHICLES PART DUE TO REAL WORLD TESTING DATA. THAT HELP DETECT THESE DEVICES WHICH WERE PREVIOUSLY UNDISCOVERED BALL IN LABORATORY SETTINGS. THE AIR BE OPEN AN INVESTIGATION AND FOUND THAT EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND VOLKSWAGEN DIESEL VEHICLES REGISTERED IN CALIFORNIA EMITTED EXCESSIVE NITROUS OXIDE A TOXIC POLLUTANTS. CALIFORNIA. HAS MADE GREAT STRIDES AND CLEANING UP THE AIR AND FIGHTING AGAINST POLLUTANTS. BUT VOLKSWAGEN'S DECEPTION WAS PARTICULARLY DAMAGING BECAUSE MANY PARTS OF THE STATE. STILL EXPERIENCE SOME OF THE WORST AIR QUALITY IN THE NATION. THIS FACT COUPLED WITH RECENT ATTEMPTS BY THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION TO ROLL BACK. CALIFORNIANS NATION LEADING CLEAN AIR LAWS MEANS THAT WE MUST ACT UPHOLD SAFEGUARDS FOR THE HEALTH OF OUR STATES RESIDENTS. AB TWENTY THREE EIGHTY ONE WHAT PARTNER WITH THE AIR BEING AND ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS LABORATORIES AND EXPERTS IN ORDER TO ENHANCE. THEIR NEW MOTOR VEHICLE EMISSIONS TESTING PROGRAM AND DISCOVER. THESE DEFEAT DEVICES AB TWENTY THREE EIGHTY ONE WOULD ALSO GIVE THE A A RP THE ABILITY TO SECURE ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO PERFORM MORE INDEPENDENT TESTING. IN ORDER TO STAY OUT THE FOR IN ORDER TO STAY AT THE FOREFRONT. DETECTING CALIFORNIA'S AIR FROM THOSE WHO WOULD VIOLATE OUR LAWS. POLLUTE OUR ENVIRONMENT AND HARM OUR RESIDENTS. THIS BILL PASSED UNANIMOUSLY OUT OF THE ASSEMBLY NATURAL RESOURCES COMMITTEE. WITH ME HERE TO STEPS OF TO TESTIFY ARE WILLIAM BARRETT SENIOR POLICY ANALYST AT THE AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION IN CALIFORNIA. AND BILL MCGOVERN POLICY DIRECTOR OF THE COALITION FOR CLEAN AIR. PLEASE PROCEED. IN ONE BOOK. WITH THE AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA LAST WEEK THE AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION RELEASE OUR ANNUAL STATE OF THE AIRPORT THAT FOUND NINETY PERCENT OF CALIFORNIANS. ARE AFFECTED LIVING COUNTIES AFFECTED BY UNHEALTHY AIR. THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR IN CALIFORNIA'S BY FAR THE LEADING SOURCE OF AIR POLLUTION THAT AFFECTS. ASTHMA CHILDHOOD LONG DEVELOPMENT LUNG CANCER HEART ATTACKS A PREACHER DEBTS. IT'S ALSO LEADING SOURCE OF CARBON POLLUTION THAT THREATENS PUBLIC HEALTH. A RESEARCH ESTIMATES FIFTEEN BILLION DOLLARS IN ANNUAL HEALTH CLIMATE YOU DAMAGES IN CALIFORNIA DUE TO THE PASSENGER VEHICLE FLEET. THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT CALIFORNIA'S STRONGER THE NATIONAL VEHICLE STANDARDS HAVE DRIVEN DOWN POLLUTION SIGNIFICANT ACROSS THE STREET AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY. IN MANY CASES CUTTING MONTHS OF UNHEALTHY AIR. GIVEN THE FEDERAL EPA ACTIONS A FRIEND OUR ONGOING PROGRESS WE NEED TO GET WE NEED GREATER ASSURANCE THAT CALIFORNIA STANDARDS OF WORKING. TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH. OUR STANDARDS ARE TOO IMPORTANT TO BE GAINED BY MANUFACTURE DECEPTIONS US HAS RESULT VOLKSWAGEN FIAT CHRYSLER THE PUT TENS OF THOUSANDS OF NON COMPLIANT VEHICLES ON CALIFORNIA ROADS IN OUR NEIGHBORHOODS. AB TWENTY THREE EIGHTY ONE WOULD ALLOW AIR BE TO COLLECT FEES. FOR MANUFACTURERS TO ENHANCE MOTOR VEHICLE EMISSION TESTING PROGRAMS TO ENSURE THAT WERE GETTING REAL WORLD BENEFITS THAT WE KNOW THAT THESE VEHICLE EMISSION STANDARDS CAN COMPLY WITH OUR PROVIDE. SO WE SUPPORT YOUR SUPPORT. NEXT WITNESS PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME WHO REPRESENT PLEASE. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS BILL MCGOVERN WITH CALLS FOR CLEAN AIR IN SUPPORT OF WHAT WE'VE LEARNED FROM THE VOLKSWAGEN SCANDAL. AND FROM OTHER PREVIOUS AND PERHAPS EVEN LATER INSTANCES OF DEFEAT DEVICES AND CHEATING ON EMISSIONS TESTING. IS THAT WE NEED TO VERIFY LEAD TESTING WITH THE REAL WORLD IN USE TESTING OF VEHICLES. AND THIS BILL WOULD GIVE THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO HELP THEM DO IT. I WAS HERE LAST YEAR SUPPORTING A VERY SIMILAR BILL THAT YOU APPROVED AND ASK YOU TO APPROVE THIS ONE AGAIN TODAY. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES AND PUBLIC.

OF. PLEASE PROCEED WE READY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT AB THREE ZERO SEVEN NINE WHICH ESTABLISHES THE CALIFORNIA PORT EFFICIENCY PROGRAM. CALIFORNIA PUBLIC PORTS ARE KEY INTERNATIONAL GATEWAYS FOR BILLIONS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF GOODS AND ARYAN EXITING THE UNITED STATES EVERY YEAR. THE PORTS OF LOS ANGELES AND LONG BEACH FOR EXAMPLE ARE TOGETHER RESPONSIBLE FOR NEARLY FORTY PERCENT OF THE TOTAL CONTAINERS CARGO ENTERING THE UNITED STATES. SUCH MASSIVE CARGO VOLUME RIGHT REQUIRES A SMOOTH INTERACTION OF MANY INDEPENDENT ACTORS WITHIN THE PORT. THIS INCLUDES SHIPPING LINES TERMINAL OPERATORS ORGANIZED LABOR RAILROADS TRACKERS BENEFICIAL CARTOONS AND MANY MORE. ALTHOUGH CALIFORNIA PORTS ARE THE STRONGEST IN THE NATION THEY CONTINUE TO FACE NEW AND COMPLEX EFFICIENCY CHALLENGES INCLUDING INCREASED TRADE VOLUMES. DEPLOYMENT OF LARGER SHIPS AND INDUSTRY COMPLEXITY. IN ORDER FOR CALIFORNIA PORTS TO CONTINUE TO SUCCESSFULLY COMPETE IN THE GLOBAL MARKETPLACE THEY MUST FIND NEW WAYS TO READ CONGESTION. AND CARGO DELAY AB THREE ZERO SEVEN NINE PROVIDE PROVIDES THE FRAMEWORK NECESSARY FOR THE STATE TO PARTNER WITH PORTS AND DELIVER RESOURCE THE RESOURCES NEEDED FOR STRATEGIC IMPROVEMENTS AND PORTS EFFICIENCY. ALL MAKE IT SIMPLE MISTER CHAIR OF. THE PORTS ONLY ABOUT ART ONLY ABOUT VOLUME THERE ALSO ABOUT VELOCITY AND MEANS GETTING THOSE CONTAINERS OUT OF THE PORT AND ON TO THEIR FINAL DESTINATION THAT'S THE GOAL OF THIS TO GET. THOSE CONTAINERS MOVING IN A MORE RAPID FASHION WHICH WE NEED. TO CUT DOWN ON GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. AND AND THE DOLLARS ASSOCIATED WITH WITH MOVING US CONTAINERS AROUND THE PORT. PLEASE RECEIVED. CARE. I HAVE NOT ROOM AT THE CALVARY TRUCKING ASSOCIATION OUR PARKS BOARD A. B. THIRTY SEVENTY NINE WHICH GREAT THE. COMPANY PROFICIENCY FINE. THE FUND WILL SUPPORT PROJECTS THAT BEST MOVE AT BEST IMPROVE VELOCITY THROUGHOUT THROUGHPUT. RELIABILITY OF THESE IMPORTANT ECONOMIC ENGINES DIGITIZATION OF SUPPLY CHAIN INFORMATION ALLOW TRUCKERS SHIPPERS AND MARINE TERMINALS TO BETTER PLAN TO COORDINATE THEIR OPERATIONS. REDUCING A REDUCING NONPRODUCTIVE TIMES FOR TRUCKERS WILL RESULT IN BETTER ECONOMICS A SMALLER ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT AND BETTER SERVICE. GOOD MOVEMENT IS ESTIMATED TO SUPPORT ONE THIRD TO THE STATE ECONOMY AND JOBS. THE PORT OF LOS ANGELES AND LONG BEACH ALONE ARE ESTIMATED SUPPORT ONE IN NINE JOBS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. INVESTMENTS MADE THROUGH THE CAPITA PROFICIENCY FINE WE'LL SEND AN IMPORTANT SIGNAL TO THE THAT CALIFORNIA TENDS TO COMPETE. FOR BUSINESS IN TODAY'S RAPIDLY EVOLVING GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAIN WE ASK YOUR AYE. ARE THERE ANY OTHER MEMBERS THE PUBLIC THE LIKE SPEAKING FAVOR OF THIS BILL. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS ANDREW AMPS WE HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE PORT OF LOS ANGELES. WHILE OF THE PORT OF LA DOES NOT HAVE A FORMAL POSITION ON THIS BILL. WE VERY MUCH AGREE WITH. THE FOCUS THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER O'DONNELL HAS BROUGHT TO THIS ISSUE OF SQUEEZING SQUEEZING OUT MORE EFFICIENCY FROM THE CARPORT FOOTPRINT IS AN ESTABLISHED UNDOCUMENTED PRIORITY FOR THE PORT OF LOS ANGELES. WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO WORK WITH THIS AUTHOR TO SEE THE BILL GO FORWARD AND TO. ZONE IN ON A FUNDING SOURCE THAT MAKE SENSE OF THIS IS A LONG TERM PRIORITY FOR THE PORT OF LA AND WE THINK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THE MEASURE FOR. I THINK YOU MUCH.

IF YOU WALK IN FILE ITEM SEVEN AB TWENTY THREE SIXTY FIVE. MAY PRESENT WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU AND GOD. THANK YOU AS CHAIR HUG GOOD AFTERNOON MISS CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS. THANK RELYING WE TO PRESENT AB TWO THREE SIX S. FIVE TODAY THIS IS AN IMPORTANT MEASURE TO ENSURE THE MAJORITY OF CRANE OWNERS IN CALIFORNIA. THE CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT NOT THE BIRD. THEY'RE ABLE TO REMAIN IN THIS I COULDN'T RESIST THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO REMAIN IN BUSINESS SOMEBODY ASKING ABOUT THAT LIVE THERE. THANK YOU. LET ME GIVE A LITTLE QUICK BACKGROUND THANK YOU FOR THE MOTION AND SECOND A CURRENT CARB DIESEL REGULATIONS CALIFORNIA RESOURCES BOARD HAVE A UNIQUE AND DISPARATE IMPACT ON CRANES COMPARED TO OTHER TYPES OF VEHICLES. THAT ARE FORCED TO FOLLOW THE SAME RULES. THESE ARE THERE ARE FOR POTENTIAL OPTIONS THEORETICALLY AVAILABLE TO GETTING EACH CRAINIC COMPLIANCE RETROFIT REPOWER PLACEMENT FOR RETIREMENT. AB TWENTY THREE SIXTY FIVE WILL ADDRESS THE CRANE INDUSTRIES UNIQUE INABILITY TO RETROFIT REPOWER OTHER EQUIPMENT THAT OTHER INDUSTRIES MAY NOT BE EXPERIENCING. IN ADDITION TO STATE AND FEDERAL EMISSIONS AND POLLUTION REGULATIONS ON CRANES THEY ARE SUBJECT TO VERY STRICT FEDERAL OSHA REQUIREMENTS THAT REGULATE THE POWER OUTPUT AND LIFTING CAPABILITIES ON CRANES. I WILL FOREGO THE REMAINDER OF THIS BUT THERE'S A LOT OF. IT BECAUSE OF THE MOTION. AND I'LL LEAVE IT FOR MY. MY WITNESSES THAT ARE HERE. TO BE ABLE TO SPEAK ON THIS. BUT SUFFICE IT TO SAY THAT. THESE ARE ISSUES THAT SMALL ABOUT CRANE OPERATORS OF SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS THAT WE HAVE WITH US TODAY FROM VARIOUS PARTS OF THE STATE. BOTH IN AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER FLORIST DISTRICT MY DISTRICT IN OTHER DISTRICTS ARE STRUGGLING WITH. AND THEY ARE PURCHASED CRANES THAT WERE COMPLETELY LEGAL WHEN THEY PURCHASE THEM IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THEY ARE BEING FORCED TO PHASE THEM OUT BECAUSE OF OF OF COURSE ARE ARE STRICT ENVIRONMENTAL. A COMPLIANCE REGULATIONS WHICH EVERYBODY. AGREES WITH BUT. WE WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT BIG PICTURE AND BRING IT INTO A REASONABLE LEVEL AND HERE WE HAVE THE SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS ARE GOING TO BE POTENTIAL DRIVEN OUT OF BUSINESS. SO AB TWENTY THREE SIXTY FIVE WILL EXEMPT ALL CRANES FROM CARDS DIESEL REGULATIONS UNTIL THE SALE TRANSFER OR NATURAL END OF SERVICEABILITY OF A CRANE. PROVIDED IT WAS IN COMPLIANCE AT THIS TIME OF PURCHASE AND I BE SEVERAL CRANE OPERATOR SO RESPECTFULLY I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. AND. FLORIDA HAVE ANY COMMENTS OR. FOR THE FIRST TWO OKAY THANK YOU. SO WHAT GO AHEAD NOW MOVES CALMLY INTO CENTRAL AVENUE YOU REPRESENTS HER. MY NAME IS MIKE CONNELLY AND I REPRESENT CHAMPION CRANE ON THE PRESIDENT CHAMPION CRANE AND I'M ALSO A MEMBER OF THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. CRANE OWNERS ASSOCIATION. SAFETY IS THE NUMBER ONE FACTOR HERE. AND FOR CARP TO REQUIRE ME TO PUT A FILTER ON THIS GOING TO AFFECT THE HORSEPOWER AND AFFECT THE CERTIFICATION OF MIGRAINES. THE CRANES ARE ANSI CERTIFIED INDIA AND CERTIFIED FOR LIFTING. AND THE OF THE MANUFACTURERS AND OSHA WON'T ALLOW US TO MAKE A MODIFICATION TO THE CRANE BECAUSE IT'LL. MAKE IT OUT OF COMPLIANCE FURTHER CERTIFICATION. SO THE ONLY THING THAT. IS LEFT FOR ME TO DO IS REPLACE THAT. AND TO GIVE YOU SOME ENOUGH NUMBER I JUST BOUGHT TEN BRAND NEW PETER BILLS THAT TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A PIECE WHICH PUT ME IN DEBT. OVER TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN THE LAST THREE YEARS AND ONE CRAIN WITH ONE VOTER THERE'S TEN MOTORS AND TEN PETER'S DON'T. BUT THERE'S ONLY ONE MOTOR INN A CRANE THIS TWO MILLION DOLLARS AND THEY RANGE FROM A. THREE QUARTERS OF A MILLION TO OVER TWO MILLION DOLLARS. AND THE RATIO OF. WHAT MOTORS ARE GOING TO BE REPLACED? FOR THE DOLLAR AMOUNT ITS WAY ASKEW ON THIS THE SAFETY FACTOR IS THE BIG FACTOR HERE WE. WE NEED TO PAY ATTENTION THAT THE CRANES ARE SAFE WE DON'T HURT PEOPLE WERE ALWAYS LIFTING. HEAVY COMPONENTS AND YOU CAN'T STOP IN THE MIDDLE OF A LIFT. AND REGENERATE THE. THE FILTERS OR IF WE HAVE MEN BASKETS ARE. PERSONNEL THAT WERE LIFTING TO DO JOBS. WE CAN'T STOP WITH THEM UP THERE AND. THESE UNITS SHUT THE CRANE DOWN CUT THE HORSEPOWER DOWN RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LIFT WOULD BE CATASTROPHIC. IF ANY OF THE WITNESSES MISTER COSTA. PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME IN THE REPRESENT. AND MY NAME IS KELLY THOMPSON I'M THE OWNER TIGHTEN CREATING RINGING. I IN STOCKTON CALIFORNIA. I'VE SPENT MY ENTIRE LIFE IN THE GREEN INDUSTRY I GREW UP WITH MY FATHER'S AN OPERATOR. WHEN I WAS TWENTY TWO I BECAME ONE OF ONLY TWO WOMEN IN THE STATE'S HISTORY. AS WELL AS THE YOUNGEST PERSON IN THE STATE'S HISTORY TO BECOME A CALLOUS OCCURRING INSPECTOR. I GOT MY FIRST GREEN IT TWENTY FOUR WHEN I STARTED MY COMPANY AND ELEVEN YEARS LATER IN. I HAVE TWENTY CRANES FIFTEEN EMPLOYEES WERE SIGNATORY OF OPERATING ENGINEERS LOCAL UNION. I'M A CERTIFIED WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS I SIT ON THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA CRANE OWNERS ASSOCIATION WHERE AGAIN I'M THE ONLY FEMALE ON THE ASSOCIATION'S HISTORY. SO TO SAY THAT I'M A RARITY BEING A WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS IN THIS INDUSTRY HAS. A BIT OF AN UNDERSTATEMENT. AND I AGREE WITH. MISTER CONNELLY THE SAFETY FACTOR IS HUGE AND WE OFTEN HAVE PERSONNEL AND MAN BASKETS. IF WE HAVE TO. STOP IN MID PICKED TO DO A RE CHEN OR SOMETHING AFFECTS THE POWER OF THE CREAM. AND WHAT IS SAFE ANYTHING THAT WE CHANGE ON THE MACHINE ITSELF IF WE PUT SOMETHING ON TAKE SOMETHING OFF. IT WILL VOID OUR LOW CHARTS IT POINTS OUT WITH THE CAPACITY OF THE CREAM IS GOOD FOR AND ALL OF OUR INSPECTION. IT'S ALSO A MASSIVE FINANCIAL BURDEN. IT'S PRETTY ON. FEASIBLE FOR MYSELF TO BE ABLE TO CHANGE MY ENTIRE FLEET ON THE TIME PERIOD THAT WERE BEING MANDATED. WE JUST NEED A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME. YOUR LAST WEEK. OH YES LAST WEEK I HAD TO CREATE MY TWO HUNDRED TON CRANE I PURCHASE IT FOR OVER MILLION DOLLARS IF WE NOW. HAVE A CATASTROPHIC ENGINE FAILURE ON I'M IN ORDER FOR ME TO REPLACE THAT SAME ENGINE IT'S OVER TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS TO GET IT REPLACED. BUT WHEN DOING SO IT WILL BE A TEAR FOR FIVE SO IT WON'T BE IN COMPLIANCE IN ORDER FOR ME TO ACTUALLY CHANGE OUT MATURE FOR FINAL HAVE HE EXPECTS DON. RE ENGINEER FROM THE MANUFACTURER NOW WE'RE TALKING ANY. MUCH LARGER AMOUNT OF MONEY SO ESSENTIALLY RIGHT NOW THAT CRANE IS FOURTH SCRAP METAL TO ME. AT OVER MILLION DOLLARS FINANCED. THANK YOU SWEETNESS YES THANK YOU MY NAME'S TOM PETTY I'M COUNTY SUPERVISOR OF SAN JOAQUIN WHICH IS NEARBY I'M ALSO A CRANE BUSINESS OWNER PROBABLY THE SMALLEST ONE THE SMALLER CREAM BUSINESSES. WHICH BE TYPICAL THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND. THROUGHOUT CITIES UP AND DOWN THE STATE WE'RE ALSO HAVE SIMILAR CRIED BUSINESS AS YOU'D FIND IN SIGN BUSINESSES AND PACK MY FATHER'S A FORMER PRESIDENT. OF THE CALIFORNIA SIGNED ASSOCIATION AND I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT PRETTY MUCH EVERY CITY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS A POLE SIGN THE NEED SERVICE THAT NEEDS A BOOM TRUCK. JUST AS EVERY CITY HAS AIR CONDITIONING UNITS ON ROOFTOPS THAT CRANES LIKE MINE AND MULTITUDES OF OTHER COMPANIES UP AND DOWN THE STATE WILL SERVICE ON A DAILY BASIS. IT IS VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO HAVE A LARGE SCREEN YOU'LL HEAR FROM A PEOPLE TODAY THAT REPRESENT THE LARGE CRANE THE LARGE CORPORATIONS. THAT OWN THE LARGE GREEN BUSINESSES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THEY STAND IN THE IN UP OPPOSITION OF THE SUPPORT THAT WE'RE ASKING FOR TO STAY IN BUSINESS WHY. FIRST OFF THEIR CRANE DEALERS. THEY BUY THEIR EQUIPMENT HOST CELL THEY PAY FOR THEIR EQUIPMENT WITH LARGE CORPORATE ACCOUNTS AND THEY'LL CYCLE THAT EQUIPMENT OUT OF STATE INTO ANOTHER YARDAGE IN THE VALUE OR. ANOTHER NEIGHBORING STATE INTO THE SECONDARY MARKET THAT THEY ALSO OWN THEY CANNOT WE CANNOT PURCHASE THAT VEHICLE FROM THEM AT THE SAME PRICE THAT THEY. HOST SALE THAT VEHICLE OUT SO IT'S STATISTICALLY NOT AVAILABLE FOR US TO COMPETE WITH THEM AS THEY BEING A A A LARGE. EQUIPMENT DEALER THAT ALSO HAS THE LARGE CORPORATE ACCOUNTS AT OIL REFINERIES AND OTHER BIG LOCATIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE SO WE'RE IN A DIFFERENT BUSINESS MODEL FOR SOME COMPANIES THEY CAN ABSORB IT. OTHER COMPANIES LIKE SMALL BUSINESSES LIKE ME THE SIGN INDUSTRY WITH SMALL GROUP TRUCKS WE CANNOT ABSORB IT I PULLED UP SOME STATISTICS EARLIER TODAY IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT. THERE WERE FIVE MILLION SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND COMMERCIAL TRUCKS TRAVELING THE ROAD AN AVERAGE OF SIXTEEN MILLION MILES ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILES A DAY. SO DROPS THE TO CALIFORNIA WE HAVE ROUGHLY TWELVE HUNDRED CRANES ABOUT TWO HUNDRED OF THEM ARE GONNA BE ON THE BOOM SIDE. WITH THOUSAND I'M WOULD BE LARGE CRANE SUCH AS REPRESENTED BY THESE TWO BUSINESS OWNERS. IF YOU AVERAGE PROBABLY ABOUT FORTY MILES A DAY TRAVELING TO AND FROM THE JOB SITE AND RUNNING THAT CREE NO MORE THAN A COUPLE HOURS IN THE COURSE THAT DAY. YOU'RE GONNA HAVE NO MORE THAN FORTY THOUSAND MILES THAT'S GONNA BE PUT ON THAT VEHICLE DALY COMPARED TO THE SIXTEEN MILLION MILES THE TRUCKING INDUSTRY IS GOING TO PUT ON THEIR TRUCKS DAILY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IF YOU DID A MATHEMATICAL EQUATION WE ARE RESPONSIBLE TO CRANE INDUSTRIES RESPONSIBLE FOR LESS THAN POINT ZERO TWO PERCENT OF ANY MISSION THAT'S GOING TO BE CONTRIBUTE TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. NICE TO LIVE IN LOS ANGELES I UNDERSTAND BEING A GOOD STEWARD AND THANK CLEAN AIR AND THE VALUE AND IMPORTANCE OF OF OUR PARTICIPATION WE'RE WE'RE. I WILL WEAR IT PLEADING WITH YOU TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT NOT ALL BUSINESS MODELS CAN ABSORB WHAT CARD IS IMPOSING ON. IT'S A FALSE NARRATIVE THAT THEY'RE IMPOSING WE CAN'T ABSORB IT WE'VE HAD CONVERSATIONS WE TRY TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS. THE CARP REPRESENTATIVES TELL US WE'LL JUST GO AHEAD LEAST BRAND NEW EQUIPMENT. WELL THAT JUST DOESN'T PENCIL OUT IN FACT I CAN TELL YOU RIGHT NOW THE OLDER RANCH IN WINTER. SHAHRAK AT THE OLDEST CRANE TO HAVE MY BUSINESS OF NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT CRANE SONNET NINETEEN NINETY CARRIER WHICH IT NEEDS TO BE RETRACTED THE NEXT YEAR TO A PLAN THAT. YOU KNOW I HAVE A NINETEEN SEVENTY BLOOM NOT BECAUSE I LIKE RUNNING AN OLD BOOM THAT'S THE ONLY BOOM THAT'S PAID FOR THAT PIECE FOR MY TWO THOUSAND NINE CREAM IS NOT GOING TO BE IN COMPLIANCE. THAT PAYS FOR MY TWO THOUSAND THREE CRANES THAT COULD BE IN COMPLIANCE SO THE STRUGGLES THAT WE HAD TO STAY IN BUSINESS I'M GONNA IMPLORE DO YOU UNDERSTAND THIS UP AND DOWN THE STATE. YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THOUSANDS OF BUSINESSES IN THE SIGN AND CRANE INDUSTRY THOUGH BE AFFECTED YOUR NEXT DOOR NEIGHBORS AND I WILL FINISH WITH THIS. YOUR NEXT DOOR NEIGHBORS THAT NEED AC UNIT PUT ON THE ROOFTOP THAT I DO DOZENS OF WEAK. AND THEIR SET BY HUNDREDS WEAKLY UP AND DOWN THE STATE THOSE PEOPLE COULD BE WAITING WEEKS AND WEEKS AND WEEKS FOR A LARGE CORPORATION TO COME IN THE SET THAT UNIT THEY'RE GONNA PAY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS. NOT TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS THAT THEY'RE GONNA PAY SMALL OPERATORS LIKE ME. SO WE NEED YOU TO UNDERSTAND THAT OUR INDUSTRY THIS IT'S NOT JUST ONE SIZE SHOE FITS ALL WE'D LOVE TO WORK WITH CARD. BUT CARVE CEREMONIAL THAT WE NEED TO BUY NEW EQUIPMENT THANK YOU SIR. ANY OTHER MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC THEN LIKE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE AUTHORS BILL. SINGLE AND ANY MEMBERS THE PUBLIC LIKE TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION. OR VOICE THEIR OPINION OF THE AUTHORS BILL. SEEING NONE ANY MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE HAVE QUESTIONS OF THE AUTHOR. MR OTHER CUSTOMERS LIKE CLOSE. I THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER NEVERS YEAH AB TWENTY THREE SIXTY FIVE WILL MEAN THE LIFE OR DEATH FOR MANY SMALL BUSINESS CRANE ORDERS INSTEAD OF CALIFORNIA. I ASK YOU TO PLEASE SUPPORT THIS MEASURE AND KEEP THESE COMPANIES AND BUSINESS AND THEY'RE WELL PAID UPPER MIDDLE CLASS EMPLOYEES WORKING THANK YOU THANK YOU AND I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR RIVAL. THANK YOU MISTER BECAUSE WOULD YOU LIKE TO IN HYMNS FLOOR. I'LL KEEP THIS VERY VERY BRIEF BUT I THINK AS AS WE DEAL WITH OUR AIR QUALITY ISSUES AND WE WORK WITH THE A OR B. I'M COMING FROM AN AG BACKGROUND AND WE'VE DEALT WITH THIS. INTRACTABLE PLACEMENT PROGRAMS OF SOME OF THOSE THINGS I WOULD JUST ENCOURAGE THE COMMITTEE AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH ALL OF THIS LET'S. LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THIS PARTICULAR INDUSTRY TO SEE IF THERE'S A SITUATION AND A SOLUTION AND A PATH FORWARD TO APPRECIATE YOUR TIME THINK SIR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME WE REALLY DO APPRECIATE IT. THANK YOU. MR COST I SYMPATHIZE WITH THE CONCERNS THAT WE WERE BROUGHT UP TODAY BY THE KIND OWNERS. HOW WE DO HAVE A FIRST BY MR MATHIS A SECOND BY MISTER PHONE? I'VE CONSTRUCTION BACKROOM THIRTY FIVE YEARS SO THE TRADE. AND I KNOW IT'S HOW EXPENSIVE OF HEAVY MACHINERY CAN BE AND HOW RETROFITS CAN COMPROMISE THE MACHINERY AS WELL. AND WHEN THEY FIRST BROUGHT IN THE PARTICULAR FILTERS THEY ARE AN ABSOLUTE DISASTER. TO THE IN ANY INDUSTRY. HOWEVER. A BLANKET EXEMPTION FOR ALL CRANES OF ANY SIZE WITH NO SET END DATE OF COMPLIANCE. IT'S NOT A GOOD APPROACH. THERE NEEDS TO BE A PATH TO COMPLIANCE. OTHERS HAVE DONE IT AND WE CAN HAVE IT AND WE CAN'T HAVE AN EVEN PLAYING FIELD. GOING FORWARD. I SYMPATHIZE WITH EACH AND EVERYONE OF THE BUSINESS OWNER FOR TWENTY THREE YEARS. I CAN'T TELL YOU THAT IT'S A FAIR PROCESS. BUT YEARS INDUSTRY NEEDS TO GET ENGAGED WITH THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD. TO MAKE THEM UNDERSTAND THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF THEIR DECISIONS TO MAKE ON YOUR INDUSTRY. THERE THE REGULATION NAY SET THE RANKS. SO WITH THAT RIGHT NOW. AND EMPLOYEE TO DO THAT. BE VERY VERY VOCAL WITH THAT INDUSTRY TO SHARE HOW MUCH IT IMPACTS YOU. AND SOMEHOW COME TO A COMPROMISE ON THAT ONE COMPLAINTS. YOU CAN'T JUST SAY I CAN'T. SOME POINT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO BE COMPLAIN THAT'S THE RULES. SO ONE FIRSTLY RIGHT NOW WAS THE BILL AS WRITTEN I CAN'T SUPPORT IT TODAY. MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.

WELL ITEM NUMBER SIXTEEN AB TWENTY EIGHT SIXTY FIVE. WHEN YOU MISTER CHAIR AND COLLEAGUES AB TWENTY EIGHT SIXTY FIVE AS A DISTRICT BILL TO ALLOW THE SAN FRANCISCO COUNTY TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY THE S. OF CTA. TO UTILIZE MANAGED LANES AS A TOOL TO ALLEVIATE CONGESTION ON THE I TWO EIGHTY IN THE U. S. WANNA ONE QUARTERS. WHICH. THANK YOU WHICH RUNS THROUGH SAN FRANCISCO CONNECTS TO SAN MATEO AND SANTA CLARA COUNTIES. WE ALL KNOW ABOUT THE CONGESTION CRISIS BEING EXPERIENCE IN THE BAY AREA NOT GOING TO BELABOR THAT BUT MANAGE LANES HELP TO INCENTIVIZE CARPOOLING. TRANSLUCENT PASSENGER EFFICIENCY WITHOUT ADDING MORE CARS TO THE ROAD THESE LANES ALREADY EXIST IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY AND SAN MATEO COUNTIES CURRENTLY PERFORMING. ENVIRONMENTAL EVALUATIONS OF THEIR LANES BUT UNFORTUNATELY. SAN FRANCISCO COUNTY DOES NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO IMPLEMENT MANAGE LANES DESPITE THE AUTHORITY ELSEWHERE. ANY DELAY IN GRANTING THIS AUTHORITY COULD LIMIT THE ABILITY TO COORDINATE MANAGE LANES IN SAN FRANCISCO WITH THE OTHER TWO COUNTIES AND LOSE THE OPPORTUNITY. TO RELIEVE SOME OF THE MOST CONGESTED ROUTES IN THE BAY AREA. I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING EFFORTS WITH STAKEHOLDERS THROUGHOUT THE BAY AS HIS BILL PROGRESSES TO THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS AND WHAT THAT WOULD LIKE TO TURN IT OVER. TO OUR SPONSOR THE SAN FRANCISCO COUNTY TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY ITS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AS WELL AS. ANOTHER STAFFER CAN HELP ANSWER TECHNICAL QUESTIONS WHEN I TURN IT OVER TO MR WHICH I. CHAIR FOR GOV MISTER CHAIRED COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME ITALY CHEN A SERVICE IT EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE COUNTY TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY OF SAN FRANCISCO WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHIU FOR HIS. AUTHORSHIP OF THIS BILL AS HE MENTIONED THIS BILL A. B. TWENTY SIXTY FIVE ALLOWS OUR COUNTY TO UTILIZE CENTER CLERIC HOW HE'S. A AUTHORITY THE VTA IS AUTHORITY TO OPERATE MANAGED EXPRESS LANES IN SAN FRANCISCO. THIS WOULD HELP US ALLEVIATE CONGESTION AND PROVIDE VOTERS WITH ANOTHER OPTION TO TRAVEL ON THIS TOPIC I CAN JUST A QUARTER IN THE BAY AREA. BY EXTENDING VT IS AUTHORITY TO OPERATE AND MANAGE LEANS. THAT WOULD PROVIDE US WITH YET ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY AN OPTION TO IT ADMINISTRATIVELY MANAGE THAT A MAN ON THIS ECONOMICALLY SIGNIFICANT CORRIDOR. AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHIU MENTIONED THIS WOULD MIRROR SAN MATEO IS ABILITY TO UTILIZE THE TO USE IT VTA IS AUTHORITY WHICH WAS ENABLED WITH PASSAGE OF S. B. FIVE NINETY FIVE LAST YEAR. AND SO WE'VE BEEN COORDINATING REGIONALLY WITH THEM AS WELL AS ASKS ASSN MATTEO COUNTY AND SANTA CLARA CALTRANS IN THE TO PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION. TO ADDRESS CONGESTION IN THE QUARTER. DEVELOPING A U. S. ONE A ONE SOUTH COMPREHENSIVE QUARTER PLAN THAT LAYS OUT A VISION FOR A CONNECTION BETWEEN SAN FRANCISCO. SAN MATEO AND SANTA CLARA. THANK YOU FOR CONSIDERING THIS AUTHORITY TO HELP IMPROVE ABILITY IN THE BAY AREA AND WE RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR SUPPORT HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU MIX WITH THIS HEARING. HAS JUST ONE MEASURE OF AND HARVEY WHO CAN ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS ANYTHING YOU WANT TO ADD TO THIS. THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WHO WOULD LIKE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE AUTHORS BILL PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME HERE REPRESENT PLEASE SHIRT JOSHUA STARK ON BEHALF OF TRANSFORM IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU VERY OTHER MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC. SELECT TESTIFYING SPUR THE AUTHORS BILL SEEING NOT ANY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC FEEL LIKE TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION. THE AUTHORS BUILD IT WAS OPINION. SEE NOTE ANY QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE LIST BAKER. THANK YOU ADAM TAKING MISTER CHU AND I KNOW IT'S A DISTRICT BILL THAT THE BAY AREA TRAFFIC CAN BE A WHOLE DISTRICT WIDE ISSUE OUR CONSTITUENTS MUTUALLY GO TO. TO GET AROUND. COUPLE QUESTIONS ON THIS IF FIRST IS. IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING I MEAN THIS THIS COULD BE ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH THE PROCESS THAT WAS SET UP BY I WANT TO SAY LAST YEAR. WHY NOT JUST FOLLOW THAT PROCESS? CARE THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION LAST YEAR'S BILL. SP FIVE NINETY FIVE PROVIDED VTT ABILITY TO. EXTEND ITS TONE OF THE REDUCE EMITIR COUNTY ONLY DID NOT INCLUDE SAN FRANCISCO. SO YOU CAN CHIU GO TO THE CDC AND ASK FOR THEM TO DO THIS ARE IN FACT US SOMEONE A CHAIR FRAZIER IS BUILT FROM A FEW YEARS AGO AB ONE NINETY FOUR DOES ALLOW IS THAT OPTIONS. THE METROPOLITAN TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION THIS PROVIDES US YET ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO WITH THE T. A.'S AUTHORITY ALLOWING FOR A THREE COUNTY A PARTNERSHIP IN THE ONE AND ONE QUARTER SO PROVIDES YET ANOTHER OPTION TO THE MTC ROUTE. THAT WAS IT ENABLED THROUGH A CHAIR FRAZIER IS BILL THAT HAVE YOU TRIED THAT ROUTE AROUND HAVE NOT WE MIGHT WANNA WE'RE NOT YET AT THE TIME OF. OF BUILDING THESE PLANES BUT WE WANT TO SET OURSELVES UP TO THAT WE HAVE A CHOICE OF EITHER OPERATING. OPERATING AGENCY TO GO WITH. BUT IN A DIFFERENT ANSWER TO THAT IS THE CDC PROCESS IS A DIFFERENT BODY WITH ITS OWN. PROCEDURES AND POLITICS AND BY THE OPPORTUNITY TO HELP MOVE THIS FORWARD THROUGH LEGISLATION NOT CARE TO GET IT DONE. IT TAKES AWHILE TO MOVE THINGS SERIOUSLY TO SEIZE OUR HOPE IS TO TO MOVE IT THROUGH AS QUICKLY AS WE CAN THROUGH THE SPOT IF WE CAN. GOT IT THANK YOU AND THEN THE OTHER IS. HOW HOW MUCH OF ELECTED AREAS WHERE? THEY HAVEN'T TAKEN ELAINE OUT OF THIS MY SAY YOU'RE GONNA TAKE A LANE THAT'S CURRENTLY NOT DEDICATED IS A HOTLINE. AND MAKE IT ONE. AS OPPOSED TO ADD AN ADDITIONAL LANE. OF TRAFFIC SO THAT YOU'RE YOU'RE ADDING THAT I KNOW THAT IN MY DISTRICT WE DID ABOUT THAT RIGHT EVEN IF THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES THE CDC DID. AN EXTRA LANE IN SOME PLACES TWO LANES ALONG FIVE EIGHTY INSTEAD TAKING ONE OUT OF COMMISSION FOR REGULAR TRAFFIC. AND IT'S WORKING RIGHT THE MILES PER HOUR. INCREASE HAS GONE VERY WELL P. I THINK PEOPLE ARE GETTING A BIT MORE BY A. DIFFERENT STORY WAS SIXTY EIGHTY. WHICH THEY TOOK AN EXISTING LANE AND MADE IT A HOT LANE AND AREN'T EXPANDING. MORE LANES AND. HAS I MEAN BURST IT'S FAIRLY YOUNG I THINK IT STARTED IN NOVEMBER. AND MAYBE EVEN THE FIRST OF THIS YEAR BUT IT'S IT'S DRAMATICALLY LESS POPULAR AND WHERE. WE HAVE SEEN MUCH LESS HAVE MILES PER HOUR. MOVEMENT AT LEAST FROM JUST CASUAL OBSERVATION THOUGH IT SEEMS MORE DATA ON IT HAVE YOU LOOKED AT THE COMPARISON. AND WHY NOT ADD ONLY. SEVEN OF UP SOONER BAKER YES WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF STUDYING BOTH CONVERTING ELAINE AND EXPANDING OUR CALLING THE PAUCITY THROUGH RESTRICTING THE SHOULDER. PARTICULARLY THE NORTH BOUND ONTO EIGHTY WE HAVE THAT EXTRA SHOULDER LANE SO WE HAVE BOTH. TYPES OF DESIGNS IN OUR CONCEPTUAL STUDIES AT THE MOMENT CALTRANS IS ALSO REQUESTED THAT WE EXAMINED A FLYOVER RAMP BUILDING A WHOLE NEW RAMP CONNECTING DIRECTLY FROM ONE A ONE TO TWO EIGHTY. THAT WILL BE IN OUR NEXT PHASE OF STUDY WITH CALTRANS AT THEIR REQUEST. AND WHERE OF ALTON NEXT WENT CURIOUS ABOUT IS WHERE THE DOLLARS GO USE MARKETER ANY PAIN AND I SEE FROM THE LANGUAGE FOR TRANSIT WILL IT GO TO ROAD MAINTENANCE THE POSSIBILITY OF FINDING RETURN TO SOURCE ON THAT ROAD WAY OF EXPANDING. SOME IRREGULAR THE IDEA IS YES TO KEEP THE FUNDS RATE IN THE QUARTER IN WHICH THEY ARE COLLECTED. CONSISTENT WITH A LOT OF THE OTHER COOPER QUARTERS IN THE BAY AREA TERMS OF ROAD MAINTENANCE AND OPERATION OF FORCE BUT THOSE ARE THE FIRST CALLS. I WE'VE TRANSIT AS WELL IN THE QUARTER THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO REINVEST DOLLARS INTO. APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU AYE I'M. THAT YOU'RE HAVING A DISTRICT THAT HAS SEEN SO MUCH CHANGE WITH HOT PLANES FROM EACH OF THE LANES AND THE IMPACT IT'S HAD ON THOSE WHO MAY NOT LIVE IN THE AREA. BUT ARE AFFECTED BY THE COMMUTE TRAFFIC I'M I'M HESITANT ON WHEN THAT WE ALREADY HAVE A PROCESS THAT ALL OTHER COMMUNITIES CAN GO THROUGH TO GO TO THE C. T. SEEING AT THE STAND. I APPRECIATE HOW MUCH YOU WANT TO EXPEDITE WHAT'S HAPPENING. BUT I I FEEL THAT THAT PROCESS IS ONE THAT ALLOWS ALL THESE ISSUES TO BE LOOKED AT BY THE CDC WHICH WE HAVE ENTRUSTED. AS A BODY WITH THE AUTHORITY TO DO THAT. I CERTAINLY WOULD ENCOURAGE EVEN MORE LOOKING AT WHAT'S HAPPENED ON SIX EIGHTY WHERE THEY TOOK HOLDING OUT OF TRAFFIC THEY HAVE THE ROOM TO RE STRIPE AND OTHERWISE IN THE IMPACT THAT IT HAS HAD. IN CONTRAST WITH ON FIVE EIGHTY AND. THANK YOU FOR THE ANSWERS. ANY OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE HAVE QUESTIONS OF THE AUTHOR. SO I HAVE A FIRST BY MEDINA SECOND BAG YEAR CURRY. MISTER CHIU WHICH LIKE CLOTHES RESPECT WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. SHOOT THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS DISTRICT BILL OF FORWARD I SERVE ON THE CALIFORNIA TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION. AND WHAT WAS THE AUTHOR OF AB ONE NINETY FOUR BUT ALSO UNDERSTAND LOCAL PROCESSES CAN BE VERY INTRICATE IN THE PROCESS DOESN'T MEAN THE CDC WON'T BE LOOKING AT THE SAME TIME IN PARALLEL.

THANK YOU CHAIR AND MEMBERS. WHAT PRESENT TO YOU TODAY AB TWENTY NINE EIGHTY EIGHTY NINE TWENTY NINETY NINE WILL CREATE A CLEAR DEFINITION FOR STAND UP ELECTRIC SCOOTERS? IN THE STATE VEHICLE CODE ESTABLISHING RULES AND REGULATIONS FOR THIS NEW MODE OF TRANSPORTATION. IN ORDER TO PROVIDE CLARITY FOR WRITERS LAW ENFORCEMENT CITY GOVERNMENTS IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT THE STATE LEGISLATOR. IT ESSENTIAL FOR THE STATE LEGISLATURE TO CREATE CLEAR DEFINITIONS TO THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY WITH THE REGULATIONS SOMEWHERE TO COMPARABLE TYPE VEHICLES AND THERE'S A HANDOUT COMING AROUND TO KIND OF SHOW THE TOO SIMILAR TYPES OF VEHICLES. HEARING THE VEHICLE CODE COMPATIBLE ALTER ALTERNATIVE MODES OF TRANSPORTATION AB TWENTY NINETY NINE CREATES A BASELINE LEGAL FRAMEWORK. FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO BUILD UPON DEPENDING. ON THE CIVIC PREDATORY NEEDS OF THEIR COMMUNITIES. AS A STATE WE NEED TO PROVIDE CLARITY AND SAFETY. REGULATIONS FOR WRITERS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT ALL CREATING SPACE FOR CITIES WITH VASTLY DIFFERENT ROADWAYS. CONGESTION PATTERNS AND REGULATORY STATE. CONGESTION POWERS TO REGULATE STAND UP ELECTRIC SCOOTERS THEY USE AS THEY SEE FIT ON THEIR STREETS ROADS AND SIDEWALKS. HERE TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY NINE EIGHTY NINE THIS CARL WITH BERT HANSEN SCOOTERS. CAR MOVE THE BILL. PLEASE PROCEED SIR BAG ACTED AFTERNOON SHARON AND AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ON MY CARL HANSEN DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS FOR BIRD. BIRD IS A AYE AT BASE STAND UP ELECTRIC SCOOTER I SHARE COMPANY. WE PROVIDE AS SUSTAINABLE AND ALL AFFORDABLE ALTERNATIVE BUT TO THE CAR. THROUGH OUR AFTER ANY IN OUR BIRDS. BIRD IS PROUD TO BE A CALIFORNIA. BASED COMPANY AND WE. COMMANDS ó YOU IN YOUR LEADERSHIP IN MAKING CALIFORNIA NATIONAL AND GLOBAL LEADER. ON. SUSTAINABLE TRANSPORTATION AND IN ADDRESSING CLIMATE CHANGE ARE THESE ARE GOALS THAT ARE OUR COMPANY SHARES. PREDATION IS COMPETING WITH THE THE CONVENIENCE OF THE AUTOMOBILE. UBIQUITOUS CURBSIDE PARKING SURFACE PARKING LOTS PARKING MINIMUMS IN ZONING. CAR BASED RIGHT SHARE APPS ENSURE THAT GETTING INTO A CAR IS IS IS ALWAYS EASY. AND AND WE THINK WE HAVE A SOLUTION TO THE CONVENIENCE CHALLENGE OF THE THE RECENT EMERGENCE OF. TALK WITH SPIKES IN THE BIKES AND AND AND ELECTRONIC STAND UP ELECTRONIC SCOOTERS I PROVIDE A CONVENIENT AND AND SUSTAINABLE ALTERNATIVE FOR FOR SHORT TRIPS. AND. FIRST LAST MILE CONNECTION I TO OUR EXISTING ALTERNATIVE TRANSIT INFRASTRUCTURE. AND FOR THAT FOR THE SAKE OF RIDERS CITIES AND LAW ENFORCEMENT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT VEHICLES OF SOME MORE POWER AND SPEED IN RULES OF OPERATION. BEAT BE GOVERNED BY SIMILAR REGULATION AB TWENTY NINE EIGHTY NINE. WOULD TAKE THE REGULATIONS APPLYING TO CLASS TO ELECTRIC BIKES AND USER THE SIMILAR ELECTRONIC BIKES THAT. WRITERS WOULD BE OUR. RUNNING ON DOCTOR SPIKE SERVICES IN AND APPLY THE SAME RULES TO THE SUMMER WE ACTING. STAND UP OR ELECTRIC SCOOTER THAT WE WANT RIDING A BIKE LANES NOT ON SIDEWALKS. AND AND YOU KNOW WE DO NOT WANT TO HAVE TO HAVE A WRITER'S CONSULT THE VEHICLE CODE WHEN THEY'RE GETTING INTO IT THAT TYPE OF VEHICLE THAT'S PERFORMING THE SAME WAY AS. A AS A CLASS TO ELECTRIC BIKE USER SIMILAR SPEED SOME SIMILAR VEHICLES THEY SHOULD BE REGULATED THE SAME WAY. THAT. REGULATIONS FOR AYE CLASS TO ELECTRONIC BIKES WAS APPROVED BY THE STATE IN TWENTY TWENTY FIFTEEN SO THAT'S THAT'S VERY RECENT AYE REGULATION AND. WE LOOK FORWARD TO BEING A PART OF THAT THE TRANSPORTATION SOLUTION IN CALIFORNIA AND THAT WE HOPE YOU WILL SUPPORT THE BILL. THANK YOU THAN ANY OTHER MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC STILL LIKE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE AUTHORS BILL. SEEING NONE REMEMBERS THE PUBLIC LIKE TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION. TO THE AUTHORS BILL. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS JOSHUA SHOT FROM CITY OF SANTA MONICA ARE A CITY OFFICIALS TO BELIEVE THAT THIS OPTION PRESENTS POTENTIALLY SUSTAINABLE IN APPEALING THE MOBILITY. A MODEL FOR OUR CITIZENS HAVING SAID THAT THREE WEEKS AGO WE DID DROP IN OPPOSITION LETTER THAT CONCERNS ABOUT SAFETY AND HOW THEY'RE OPERATED AND OUR PARK IS THE CASE MAY BE. WHETHER UNDER CURRENT LAW ARE NOT ARE ARE REFLECTED IN YOUR ANALYSIS REALLY WELL WANT TO LET THE COMMITTEE KNOW AND THE AUTHOR KNOW THAT OUR. STAFF IN THE CITY MANAGER'S OFFICE IN SANTA MONICA LAST FRIDAY HAD A CONVERSATION WITH THE TRANSPORTATION STAFF'S.

CAME UP WITH THE CONCEPTUAL PROPOSAL THAT WE'VE ONLY MADE TO THE AUTHORS SPONSOR IN THE LAST TWENTY FOUR HOURS A SET OF AMENDMENTS THAT MIGHT. BE A PATHWAY TO RESOLVE OUR CITIES IS CONCERNS STILL HAS TO BE CHECKED OFF FORMALLY BY BY ELECTED AND WHAT NOT BUT WE'RE HOPING TO WORK WITH. THE AUTHOR HIS SPONSOR MISTER COMMITTEE.

JEFF TONE A CHAIR FRAZIER AND MEMBERS. RIVERS OF THE CALIFORNIA COUNCIL OF THE BLIND THE LARGEST ORGANIZATION OF BLIND AND VISUALLY IMPAIRED CALIFORNIANS AND WE ARE IN STRONG OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT. THESE LETTERMAN SCOOTERS COULD BE USED ON SIDEWALKS DEPENDING UPON. CITY REGULATIONS AND WE THINK THIS WOULD BE. DEPLORABLE PUBLIC POLICY. THEY'RE EXTREMELY QUIET. OWN CHILDREN PEOPLE IN WHEELCHAIRS PEOPLE WHO ARE BLIND WOULD HAVE ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TASK OF GETTING OUT OF THE WAY OF SOMEONE WHO. DIDN'T DO NOT RIDE THESE IN A PROFESSIONAL MANNER. IN ADDITION FOR THOSE AREAS THAT DO NOT HAVE SIDEWALKS. IN THE THE PEDESTRIAN WOULD BE COMPETING WITH THESE ELECTRIC SCOOTERS AND WE THINK AT THIS POINT ON THIS IS VERY BAD PUBLIC POLICY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NEXT BIGGER OPPOSITION PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME AND WHO YOU REPRESENT PLEASE. HELLO MY NAME IS SYLVIA EAST AND I AM A CITIZEN I'M A LOCAL PROPERTY OWNER TAX PAYER AND A REGISTERED VOTER. LYING HERE IN OPPOSITION AND THAT'S BECAUSE AS I AM A FORMER EDUCATOR AND A PARENT AND A PERSON THAT FREQUENTLY WALKS ON OUR SIDEWALKS IN CRISIS STREETS. I HAVE EXTREME DIFFICULTY WITH THINGS THAT WON'T MAKE VERY MUCH SOUND BUT GO VERY FAST. IF I ACCIDENTALLY COLLIDE WITH ANOTHER PEDESTRIAN THAT'S SIMPLY MY SKIN AGAINST THEIR SKIN I CAN MODEL LIFE I SAY I'M SO SORRY AND I MOVE ON. IF I GET HIT BY ONE OF THESE VEHICLES MAY HAVE AN ADULT PERSON ON IT. COMING AT ME AT TWENTY MILES AN HOUR. THAT'S COULD BE A TWO HUNDRED POUND VEHICLE OF STEEL AND ALUMINUM CRASHING INTO ME. THEY MAY HAVE METAL PROTECTING THEM AND MAYBE A HELMET I GOT NOTHIN. THAT'S GOING TO BE A LIFE CHANGING EVENT SOAPY ALLOW THIS TO GO THROUGH I'M ASKING PLEASE YOU STAND IN THAT POSITION IS THAT IT ME. OR PUT YOUR SPOUSE OR YOUR CHILD THERE THANK YOU TAKE YOU NEXT WITNESS PLEASE TAKE YOUR NAME AND WE REPRESENT PLEASE. THANK YOU. MEMBERS OF THE BOARD AND CHAIRMAN. REPRESENTING MYSELF AS A MEMBER THE COMMUNITY FOR OVER TWENTY FIVE YEARS ANY VOTER. ARE I'VE BEEN ON THE BAD SIDE OF THOSE IN THOSE IN A MAJOR ACCIDENT. WHERE THE HOSPITAL BILL ONE UP TO MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS? SO IT'S NO FUN BEING HIT. I WOULD I HAD ESTIMATED THAT IT WOULD TAKE EIGHTY EIGHT FEET AT TWENTY MILES AN HOUR FOR THESE VEHICLES BEFORE THEY WOULD COME TO A STOP. PLUS THE DISTANCE I WOULD TAKE FOR TO COME TO A STOP SO IN SHORT I OPPOSE THIS. FOR OF SAFETY OF THE SIDEWALK OR LIKE TO SEE ALL MOTORIZED VEHICLE STAY IN THE SAME LANE. AND ALL PEDESTRIANS AND SIDEWALKS WERE CREATED FOR PEDESTRIANS SO I HOPE YOU KEEP IS FOR PEDESTRIANS THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS PLEASE RAINY EX CALIFORNIA'S IN DISABILITY RIGHTS IN STRONG OPPOSITION. THANK YOU ANY OTHER ALSO. IT WAS THE PUBLIC WHO LIKE TO TEST Y. IN OPPOSITION TO THE AUTHORS THOUGH IT WAS HER OPINION. THE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC THAT WOULD LIKE TO I MEAN SCUSE ME OF COMMITTEE WOULD LIKE TO ASK QUESTIONS OF THE AUTHOR. MR MEDINA. I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS TO THE OTHER THAT THAT THE FIRST ONE IS. WHERE WHERE DO THEY? SCOOTERS OPERATE NOW WHERE THEY PERMITTED TO OPERATE NOW. AND DOES THE BILL. CHANGE OR ADDRESS WHERE THE SCOOTERS. YEAH. I THANK YOU. FOR SOME OF YOUR. SO. FOR FIRST LET ME SAY WE DO SHARE THE CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED THERE AND THAT IS NOT THE INTENT OF THE BILL WE AT THE AT THE BIRD INTENDS. WRITERS OF STAND UP ELECTRIC SCOOTERS TO RIDE LIKE A BICYCLE. THE THE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL THAT ADDRESSES WRITING ON THE SIDEWALK IS. SECTION FIVE FORTY THREE POINT SEVEN A SAYS A STANDUP ELECTRIC SCOOTERS A TWO WHEELED DEVICE THAT HAS HANDLEBARS FLOORBOARD. THE BASIC DEFINITION. SUBSECTION PIECE SO EXCEPT APPS EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN SUBDIVISION SEE A STAND UP ELECTRIC SCOOTER. MAYBE OPERATED ON SIDEWALKS AND MAYBE PART IN THE SAME MANNER AND SAME LOCATIONS AS A BICYCLE MAYBE PARTS AND THEN SEE IS A LOCAL AUTHORITY. MAY ADOPT RULES AND REGULATIONS BY ORDINANCE OR RESOLUTION PROHIBITING OR RESTRICTING PERSONS FROM WRITING OR PROPELLING INSTEAD OF ELECTRIC SCOOTER ON HIGHWAY HIGHWAYS SIDEWALKS ROADWAYS. SO WE AYE ASSEMBLY OUR GOAL WAS TO LEAVE IT UP TO THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO DECIDE HOW THEY WANTED TO REGULATE THIS. WE AYE I THINK BIRD WOULD BE COMFORTABLE WITH THAT WHOLE SECTION WAS NOT PART OF THE BILLS THAT WAS. SUPPORTED BY THE AUTHOR IN THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY TO THEIR SATISFACTION WE REALLY DON'T WANT WRITERS WRITING ON THE SIDEWALK. WERE ACTUALLY ADDING TO IT TO EVERY BIRDS PHYSICALLY ON THE FOOTBOARD DO NOT RIDE ON THE SIDEWALK. AND THE THE ONLY INSTANCE WHERE WE WOULD IMAGINE IT COULD BE APPROPRIATE AS IF SOME SAID HE HAD SOME KIND OF MIXED USE. CONCRETE PROMESAS THAT HAD SOME SECTIONS SET ASIDE FOR FASTER FORMS OF TRANSPORTATION IN SOME SECTIONS SET ASIDE FOR. PEDESTRIANS BUT WE REALLY DON'T WANT BIRDS AND PEDESTRIANS MIXING UP BECAUSE OF THE CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED AND THAT'S NOT THE INTENT OF THE BILL THE BILL. AS I UNDERSTAND IT AND AND AND AND WHY WE ARE SPONSORING IT IS TO PROVIDE THAT CLARITY I TWO TWO RIDERS AND CITIES AND AND ENFORCEMENT. THANK YOU. MISTER NAZARIAN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF. TO I USED TO FOLLOW UP ON. THE MISTER MEDINA'S QUESTION THEN OF WOULD YOU BE. GIVEN THAT IT'S OF NO CONCERN TO YOU ONE WAY OR THE OTHER WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO TAKE OUTSIDE WALKS AND. I ASK THIS BECAUSE IT I I APOLOGIZE I HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO SPEAK WITH THE AUTHOR ON THIS. I'D WANNA SUPPORTED. TO TO HELP YOU MOVE THIS ALONG BUT I DO HAVE CONCERNS WHEN IT COMES TO. SPECIAL HAD DANCE AREA LIKE LOS ANGELES WHERE THAT THE SIDEWALKS ARE IN UNIFORM EITHER. YOU HAVE CERTAIN SIDEWALKS THAT ARE EIGHTY YEARS OLD THAT ARE ONLY MAYBE TWO FEET WIDE IN CERTAIN LOCATIONS. NOT EVEN ENOUGH TO HAVE ONE HANDICAP. ONE WHEELCHAIR. BEING ABLE TO TRAVERSE AS OPPOSED TO HAVING. THE COMPETITION OF ONE OF THESE. PRODUCTS ANY ANNA WHEELCHAIRS SO WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO JUST TAKE OUTSIDE WALKS. I THINK WE WOULD BE WILLING TO DO THEIR CERTAINLY TAKE A LOOK AT I THINK ONE OF THE BEAUTIES OF THIS BILL HOW IS READ AS IS GIVEN TO LOCAL CONTROL WE JUST WANTED TO HAVE. AN OVERARCHING DIALOGUE THAT THIS THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN'T WORK ON AS A STATE AND REGULATE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL BECAUSE WE DO YOU KNOW EACH ONE OF OUR COMMUNITIES HAS DIFFERENT NEEDS. AND I'M A FROM A RELATIVELY RURAL COMMUNITY SO IS MODESTO FRIEND SINCE THIS COULD BE GREAT FOR OUR DOWNTOWN AREA STAND STATE ON ON THE COLLEGE CAMPUSES THIS COULD BE GREAT BUT THOSE ARE RELATIVELY WIDE OPEN SO THAT WE WOULD HAVE ONE SET OF RULES FOR US. AND WE WERE TALKING ABOUT SOMEBODY'S MORE CONGESTION YOU KNOW PLACES YOU KNOW BURDEN I THINK THE COMPANY WORKING WITH THE LOCAL LEGISLATORS WOULDN'T PUT THIS ABOUT YOU KNOW THE VEIL BUILDING FOR THE SCOOTERS IN THAT PARTICULAR LOCATION THEY WOULD MOVE IT TO WHERE IT ACTUALLY WORKS AND BENEFITS THE. COMMUNITY SO I THINK THE WAY THAT THIS BILL IS WRITTEN NOW ALLOWS FOR SIGNIFICANT. AMOUNT OF LOCAL CONTROL. I DO. FOR IT BECAUSE I DON'T. AS AS. AS AS I DON'T THINK I'M GOING TO BE SUPPORTING IT. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER MEMBERS THAT. WAS THAT YOUR FIRST. HOME SO COUPLE THINGS I JUST WONDERING SO I REALIZE THAT THESE GO TWENTY MILES PER HOUR. IZURIETA REGULATE THESE SO THE MAYBE INITIALLY DURING A PILOT TIME THAT WE COULD TRY COMMUNITIES THAT THEY'RE ONLY GOING. MAYBE EIGHT TO TEN MILES NOT JUST TO GIVE ME A SHOT. UMPIRE SUPPORT NEW TECHNOLOGIES IS NO DEPTH. TO IS ABOUT IT I REALLY SUPPORT YOU WORKING. IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. BICU I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO HAVE AN OVERSIGHT AUTHORITY I THINK YOU SAID BEFORE IT'S. EACH COMMUNITIES DIFFERENT AND. MAY WORK IN SOME MAY NOT WORK IN OTHERS BUT THE NUMBER ONE THING IS THAT NOW THEY'RE BRINGING NEW TECHNOLOGIES I THINK THAT MORE AND MORE THAT WE NEED TO WORK AS PARTNERSHIPS. AND TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE TECHNOLOGIES WORK I DID TO HEAR THE TESTIMONY FOR THE OPPOSITION I TRULY UNDERSTAND. I THINK WE GREAT JUSTICE MAYBE INITIALLY TO GET THESE OUT TO SEE HOW THEY WORK. NOT EVERYBODY RESPECTS EVERYBODY RIGHT AND THEY DON'T ALWAYS WANT TO FOLLOW THE RULES AND SO THAT'S MY CONCERN WOULD BE WITH THIS. YOU KNOW I REALLY LIKE JUST TO SAY YOU KNOW MAKE SURE YOU STAY IN THOSE BY PLANES OR WHATEVER WHERE THE PROPERTY. YEAH. TIRE IS A SAFETY ISSUE SO. I'M HOPING THE OF CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS AND. I'LL BE SUPPORTING A BILL TODAY. AND I APPRECIATE I LAUGHED SO MANUFACTURE SOME ON HOW WE CAN COME IN AND THERE'S A LOT OF ON PATROL IN POWER STEP WE CAN REGULATE THEM ALL DAY LONG WE COULD THE GOVERNOR'S ON SO I'M SURE THAT THERE'S A. WHAT WOULD WE DO CURRENTLY DOWN THROTTLE EVERY BIRD TED FIFTEEN MILES AN HOUR? SAYS TODAY THAT THE TWENTY MILE PER HOUR CAP AND THERE'S JUST NEARING THE CLASS TO ELECTRIC BY DEFINITION. NEARLY QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE. MISTER NAZARIAN YOU HAVE ONE MORE QUESTION YOU SAID. WELCOME THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I. WITHOUT KNOWING REALLY WELL. WHETHER THIS THIS THIS IS A SAFER ALTERNATIVE ALTERNATIVE OR NOT. IN PLACES LIKE. IN CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS LIKE IN LOS ANGELES WHERE. THERE ARE. PACIFIC BIPLANES DEDICATED BY CLAIMS. WOULD YOU BE WILLING AT LEAST TO. HAVE YOU HAVE TAKEN AMENDMENT WHERE. RECOGNIZING THOSE JURISDICTIONS THAT HAVE DEDICATED BIKE LANES. THAT. YOU WOULD NOT BE THIS WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO BE UTILIZED ON SIDEWALKS. SOMETHING TO THAT NATURE WHERE IT SPEAKS. IT IT IT IT. PLACES SPECIFIC WALLS. AND RESTRICTIONS KNOW I AND I I GET WHERE YOU COME FROM AN ABSOLUTELY YOU KNOW AND THEY WITHOUT THE CONVERSATION WE CAN CONTINUE TO HAVE ON KIND TO FIND SOME OF THE SAFETY ASPECTS OF THIS. BUT NO ABSOLUTELY IF THERE IS A DESIGNATED BIKE PATH. PROBABLY NO REASON HE SHOULD BE ON THE SIDEWALK SO I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING WE COULD ABSOLUTELY. GET TO. I'M TAKING THAT S.. AS A ASK. OKAY THANK YOU THAT. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS SEEING NONE. SO BUT AT THIS POINT TIME WILL TAKE THAT AS YOU'VE AGREED TO TAKE AMENDMENTS AND WORK WITH OUR STAFF. TO. HOW PUT BUT THE MINUTES INTO? PRINT FOR APPROPRIATIONS. BEFORE APPROPRIATIONS CRACKED. AND IT DOESN'T HAPPEN WILL RESERVE THE RIGHT ON THE FLOOR. YOU ALWAYS DO YES I. HER. THANK YOU FRED REALIZING THAT. SO WITH THAT YOU KNOW THAT NO OTHER QUESTIONS THANK YOU FOR ACCEPTING THOSE LIMITS OF. SINCE THE RIGHT THING TO DO. SO. WE HAVE THE FIRST BY MR MATHIS A SECOND BY SOME REMEMBER BAKER. YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S A IT'S A GREAT START WE DON'T WANNA INTENTIA TECHNOLOGY IN NEW WAYS OF DOING THINGS. LOVE YOU TO. LOVE IT FOR YOU TO TRACK THIS COULD SAFETY ALSO. HOME THAT THERE IS THINGS AGO FOR THE CONCERN. ARE HURTING PEOPLE OR OR WHATEVER THAT YOU. ADDRESS THOSE GOING FORWARD. AND I LOVE THE FACT THAT WE HAVE TO LOCAL CONTROL ISSUE AS HAS BEEN ISSUED WORD WILL AND WILL NOT WORK. THAT MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CLICK.

PLEASE PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY. VERY MUCH THANK THE MEMBER THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND THE CHAIR HER DEDICATED WORK IN MOVING THIS BILL FORWARD. I'D LIKE TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS IS NEGOTIATED WITH THE CHAIR TODAY AND AGAIN I THINK YOU CHAIR FRAZIER FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS. IN THIS MEASURE TODAY ARE PRESENT AB TWENTY THREE SIXTY THREE IN AN ATTEMPT TO ADDRESS INJURIES AND FATALITIES AS A RESULT OF INCREASING SPEEDS ACROSS THE STATE. OUR OFFICE HAS RECEIVED AN OUTPOURING POURING OF SUPPORT FROM LOCAL COMMUNITIES TRYING TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF INCREASED SPEEDING AT ITS IMPACTS ON SAFETY. THE LEAGUE OF CITIES THE CITY OF WATSONVILLE CITY OF LOS ANGELES CITY OF MALIBU CITY OF OAKLAND ALBERTA ADVOCACY GROUPS IN SANTA MONICA SAN JOSE SAN FRANCISCO RIVERSIDE AND OTHERS. HAVE ALL REACHED OUT UNSOLICITED TO US IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY THREE SIXTY THREE. THIS ISSUE BEGAN FOR ME IN GLENDALE WHICH IS A HORRIBLE TRAFFIC SAFETY PROBLEM. I'M. WE ARE A CITY OF TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND RESIDENTS. AND WE'VE HAD FIVE HUNDRED AND SIXTY TWO LIVES LOSS FROM TWO THOUSAND TWELVE TO TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN TO TRAFFIC RELATED COLLISIONS. TRAFFIC AND PEDESTRIAN AND BICYCLE COLLISIONS IN LOS ANGELES HAVE REACH REALLY EPIDEMIC PROPORTIONS JUST LAST WEEKEND IN LOS ANGELES I BELIEVE FOUR PEOPLE LOST THEIR LIVES. IN TRAFFIC COLLISIONS. WE CAN BEFORE LAST I THINK. I GLENDALE IMPLEMENTED A BICYCLE MASTER PLAN AND INVESTED IN ST ENGINEERING ALL ACROSS THE CITY IN ORDER TO SLOW THE FLOW OF TRAFFIC AND ENSURE PEDESTRIAN AND BICYCLE SAFETY. WE'VE BEEN ENCOURAGING MORE PEOPLE TO COME OUT ON TO THE STREETS TO WALK INTO BICYCLE AND YET BECAUSE WE'RE LOOKING AT THE AVERAGE EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT OF DRIVERS SPEED. I'M SPEED LIMITS HAVE TO CONTINUALLY BE TO BE REYES EVEN AGAIN AGAINST THE OBJECTIONS OF RESIDENTS. AT THE HEART OF THIS A BILL IS USING DATA TO IDENTIFY WHERE SAFETY IS PROBLEMATIC SO NOT HAVING OF HAVING UNBIASED DATA DRIVEN APPROACH TO THIS ISSUE. THIS BILL WILL CREATE A TASK FORCE THAT BRINGS TOGETHER STAKEHOLDERS IN EVERY SECTOR. LOOKING AT AVAILABLE RESEARCH OUT OF ARE MAJOR UNIVERSITIES UCLA AND BERKELEY AND OTHER STUDIES THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO FOCUS ON HOW BEST TO ADDRESS SEVERE INJURIES AND FATALITIES AS A RESULT OF SPEEDING VEHICLES. WE KNOW THAT THE BRAIN WHICH IN THIS BILL NEEDS TO BE REFINED THAT THIS IS A BIG ISSUE WE ARE VERY LOOK VERY MUCH LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING WITH ALL THE STAKE HOLDERS AND THE CHAIR. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE NARROW THE SCOPE OF THIS BILL AND TO DO WHAT IT'S SUPPOSED TO DO WHICH IS TO GIVE COMMUNITIES THE TOOLS THAT THEY DESPERATELY NEED. TO REDUCE THESE COOL TERRIBLE COLLISIONS AND FATALITIES. WITHOUT I WILL. JUST MOVED TO MY ADVOCATES AND I'LL JUST SAY THAT WE NEVER INTENDED THIS BILL TO BE A STANDALONE MEASURE WE KNOW THE COMMUNITIES NEED TO TO DEAL WITH ENGINEERING. THEY NEED TO DO WITH ENFORCEMENT THEY NEED TO DO WITH EDUCATION THEN TO DO ALL OF THE EASIER TO TAKES EVALUATION AND EVERYTHING ELSE THIS IS JUST ONE TOOL THAT WE THINK IT IS MISSING RIGHT NOW. I WOULD INVITE ALL OF THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE TO JOIN US AND GIVE US INPUT UP WE KNOW THAT THIS IS IMPORTANT IN A LOT OF YOUR COMMUNITIES AND WE WANT TO MAKE THIS A VERY INCLUSIVE. OF TASK FORCE THAT WE CAN HEAR FROM EVERYBODY. THE GOAL IS TO TRY TO REDUCE OUR VEHICLE RELATED COLLISIONS DOWN TO ZERO TODAY WITH ME IN SUPPORT I HAVE JENNIFER COHEN FROM THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION. AND AMELIA CRONY FROM FROM CALIFORNIA WHAT. GOOD AFTERNOON. CAN HEAR ME. GOOD AFTERNOON CHEN COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS JENNIFER CHO AND I'M THE DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS FOR IT THAT DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION AND LOS ANGELES. LAST YEAR IN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE PEOPLE LOST THEIR LIVES IN TRAFFIC CRASHES. THIS WAS MORE THAN GANG HOMICIDES. IT IS THE LEADING CAUSE OF ACCIDENTAL DEATH FOR CHILDREN IN OUR COUNTY. TO THIS AND IN TWENTY FIFTEEN MEREKA STUDIES SIGNED AN EXECUTIVE DIRECTIVE TO ELIMINATE TRAFFIC FATALITIES TO AN INITIATIVE CALLED VISION ZERO. THE MAYOR AND COUNCIL HAVE SUBSEQUENTLY DEDICATED TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO MAKE STREETS SAFER. THEY RECOGNIZE THAT THE RECIPE FOR SAFE STREETS REQUIRES SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENT IN ENGINEERING EDUCATION AND ENFORCEMENT. THIS BILL IS FOCUSED ON ONE OF THOSE ESSENTIAL INGREDIENTS ENFORCEMENT. STUDIES HAVE REPEATEDLY SHOWN THAT SPEED IS UNDENIABLY TIED TO THE LIKELIHOOD OF A CRASH OCCURRING AND ITS SEVERITY. THE NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD STATES THAT SPEED MANAGEMENT IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE. TOOL FOR PREVENTING TRAFFIC DEATHS. BUT CURRENT CALIFORNIA'S SPEED ENFORCEMENT LIVES FORCE MUNICIPALITIES TO IGNORE THESE FACTS WHEN SETTING SPEED LIMITS. LAST YEAR IN ORDER TO ENFORCE SPEEDS ON OUR HIGH INJURY NETWORK THE NETWORK OF STREETS WERE SIXTY FIVE PERCENT OF OUR FATE ON SEVERE CRASHES OCCUR WE HAD TO RAISE SPEED LIMITS BECAUSE OF THE CURRENT LAW. LET ME REPEAT THAT BECAUSE OF STATE LAW LOS ANGELES HAD TO RAISE SPEED LIMITS ON NINETY FOUR MILES OF OUR MOST DANGEROUS STREET. THIS IS A LOGICAL AND NEEDS TO CHANGE SPEEDS NEED TO BE SEPARATE SAFETY. SETTING SPEEDS FOR SAFETY IS AN EXISTING PRACTICE STATE LAW REQUIRES THAT WE DO IN YOUR SCHOOLS WE DO IT ON FREEWAYS IN FACT THERE'S A STATEWIDE TWENTY FIVE MILE PER HOUR PIMA THOUGHT SHE LIMIT ON RESIDENTIAL STREETS FOR SAFETY. NONE OF THESE REQUIRE SPEED SURVEYS OR EVEN CONSIDER THE EIGHTY FIFTH PERCENTILE. THEY SIMPLY RECOGNIZE AND PRIORITIZE SAFETY. PRIORITIZING SAFETY SHOULD EXTEND TO ALL TYPES OF STREETS. I'D LIKE TO TALK FOR A MOMENT ABOUT THE EIGHTY FIFTH PERCENTILE METHODOLOGY. THIS INDUSTRY STANDARD WAS DEVELOPED IN THE MID NINETEEN HUNDREDS AND WHILE THE SCIENCE BEHIND AN OBJECTIVE METHODOLOGY REMAINED SOUND THE CONTEXT FOR ITS APPLICATION HAS CHANGED. THE MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIANS NO LONGER LIVE WORK COMMUTE ON RURAL ROADS. AB TWENTY THREE SIXTY THREE SIMPLY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT TODAY OUR STREETS ARE UNPRECEDENTED CONGESTED MENAGERIE OF WALKERS BICYCLIST DRIVEWAYS DELIVERY TRUCKS STROLLERS CARS MOTORCYCLES WHEELCHAIRS FOOD TRUCKS. PARKING LOTS AND PARK LOTS. PARTLY IT'S. AND THAT WE NEED MORE LATITUDE TO SET SPEECH APPROPRIATE FOR THESE MODERN CONDITION. CITIES NOW BEST WHERE THE SAFETY ISSUES ARE ON THEIR STREETS AND THEY SHOULD BE PERMITTED TO ADDRESS THIS. WE SEE GREATER LOCAL CONTROL TO ADDRESS OUR SAFETY NEEDS. CITY SHOULD NOT BE BEHOLDEN TO A ONE SIZE FITS ALL METHODOLOGY THAT ARE NECESSARILY COMPROMISES RESIDENTS SAFETY. THE BILL BEFORE YOU TODAY IS ABOUT SAVING LIVES PLAIN AND SIMPLE. THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRIEDMAN FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON TRANSPORTATION SAFE. NEXT AUTHORED UNKNOWN REMIND YOU THAT WE HAVE THE SUPPORT FROM THE CHAIR. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR FRAZIER AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I'M EMILY A CROWDED THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF LOS ANGELES WALK IN ORGANIZATION THAT WORKS TO MAKE WALKING LOS ANGELES CA ACCESSIBLE AND EQUITABLE. I'M YOUR SUPPORT TO SUPPORT A FAMILY BILL TWENTY THREE SIXTY THREE. UNLIKE MANY CITIES AND TOWNS ACROSS CALIFORNIA MUCH OF LA IS DESIGNED FOR THE SWIFT UNINTERRUPTED MOVE IT OF CARS. NO MATTER THE COST PEOPLE WALKING AND BIKING HAVE BEEN PAYING THE PRICE FOR YEARS LAST YEAR AS CHEN JUST MENTIONED MORE THAN A THOUSAND PEOPLE WERE KILLED OR SEVERELY INJURED AND TRAFFIC CRASHES IN LOS ANGELES ALONE. IN THE PAST TWO YEARS PEDESTRIAN FATALITIES IN LOS ANGELES HAVE INCREASED EIGHTY TWO PERCENT. THE PROBLEM WITH THE EIGHTY FIFTH PERCENTILE METHODOLOGY IS THAT OUR SPEED LIMITS ARE ESSENTIALLY SET BY WHAT DRIVERS DEEM TO BE SAFE AND REASONABLE. AND DRIVERS ARE QUITE COMFORTABLE OPERATING VEHICLES AT DEADLY SPEEDS ON STREETS DESIGNED FOR THEM TO DO SO. THE RESULT IS A DEATH OR SEVERE INJURY IN LA EVERY SEVEN HOURS. IN ONE WEEK THIS MONTH IN SOUTH LOS ANGELES A QUICK SNAPSHOT THAT THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER JUST MENTIONED. TWENTY TWO YEAR OLD FREDDIE FRAZIER WAS KILLED RIDING HIS BICYCLE IN EFFORT TO CONTROL HIS TYPE ONE DIABETES. FIFTY TWO YEAR OLD ALFREDO ORTIZ WAS STRUCK AND KILLED WALKING ACROSS WALK FIFTY SEVEN YEAR OLD GREGORY MORE WAS STRUCK AND KILLED ANOTHER CROSSWALK. SIXTY YEAR OLD CHRISTOPHER WHITE WAS STRUCK AND KILLED BY HIS BICYCLE THIS IS ONE WE CAN SOUTH LOS ANGELES. NONE OF THIS IS SAFE FOR REASONABLE. THIS IS HAPPENING ACROSS THE STATE. COLLECTIVELY MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE WERE INJURED IN ONE YEAR OF TRAFFIC COLLISIONS IN YOUR DISTRICTS. AND ACROSS CALIFORNIA TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND PEOPLE WERE INJURED. AGAIN NONE OF THIS IS SAFE WERE REASONABLE. YEAH WE UPHOLD THE EIGHTY FIFTH PERCENTILE OF GOSPEL. AB TWENTY THREE SIXTY THREE WILL ALLOW JURISDICTIONS TO SET SPEED FOR SAFETY PARTICULARLY FOR OUR MOST VULNERABLE RESIDENTS YES WE MUST DESIGN SAFER STREETS WHICH THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES IS MAKING PROGRESS ON. BUT CITY'S LEADING ON VISION ZERO RECOGNIZE THAT IN ADDITION TO ENGINEERING EDUCATION WE MUST SET SPEED FOR THE SAFETY OF KIDS AND SENIORS INSTEAD OF THE COMFORT OF DRIVERS IN EVER MORE POWERFUL VEHICLES. ONE OF THE FIRST US POLICYMAKERS TOOK WHEN YOU EXIT A LOT VISION ZERO WAS A LIMIT SPEED LIMITS TO TWENTY FIVE MILES PER HOUR IN NEW YORK. ALONG WITH ENGINEERING EDUCATION TWO YEARS LATER NEW YORK'S TWENTY THREE PERCENT DECLINE IN TRAFFIC FATALITIES COMPLETELY BOOKS NATIONAL TRENDS. WE NEED EVERY TOOL IN STRATEGY AVAILABLE TO US TO DO THE SAME IN LOS ANGELES AND ACROSS CALIFORNIA OUR STREETS AND SPEED LIMIT POLICIES ARE WELL PAST DUE FOR AN UPDATE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTES THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS BILL THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN WAS JOSHUA SHOT WITH CHAU YOUR AUNTS WE FOR CITY OF LOS ANGELES MAYOR ERIC GARCETTI YOU'VE HEARD WERE A VISION ZERO CITY THE MAYOR AGREES WITH THE AUTHOR THAT SEVERE AND FATAL TRAFFIC CRASHES ARE A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS THIS BILL WOULD PROVIDE ANOTHER TOOL FOR PROMOTING SAFETY. IN OUR STREETS WE AGREE THAT SPEED IS NOT THE ONLY INGREDIENT FOR SAFER STREETS BUT IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT WE HAVE MORE TOOLS TO ADDRESS THAT. ADDITIONALLY THE CENSUS GOODNESS WHAT TRANSPORTATION AGENCY SUPPORTS THE BILL. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS SINCE FOR THE BILL. STEVE ALTOGETHER CALVET BICYCLE% COALITION ALSO SUPPORT PICK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON CAROL SUMMING UP THE CITY OF SACRAMENTO IN SPORTS. THANKS VERY CITY OF LONG BEACH IN SUPPORT. JOSHUA STARK ON BEHALF OF TRANSFORMING CALIFORNIA WALKS IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU ANY OTHER MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC IN SUPPORT OF THE AUTHORS BILL. SEEING NONE HITTING MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC THERE IN OPPOSITION OR HAVE NO. OPINION ON THE AUTHORS BILL. PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME AND HE REPRESENTING PLEASE FOR THE RECORD MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE SHANE GUSMAN ON BEHALF OF THE TEAMSTERS AND ABOUT COMMITTED TRANSIT UNION. WE DO HAVE AN OUTPOST POSITION BUT WITH THE AMENDMENTS. ONCE WE REVIEW THEM WE WILL PROBABLY GET A NEUTRAL POSITION DEPENDING ON THE STAKEHOLDERS. GET BACK IN PICK YOU. I MISTER CHAIRMAN FIRST HIM CHIANG WITH THE AUTO CLUB OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. AGAIN WITH THE AMENDMENTS. WE ANTICIPATE GOING NEUTRAL ON WOULD HAVE WE WOULD DO SO AFTER WE ACTUALLY SEE THOSE AMENDMENTS IN PRINT THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. MY CARPENTER WITH THE AUTO CLUB OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. ON WE AGREE THIS IS MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. THANK YOU. THREE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC THAT LIKE TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION OR VOICE OUR OPINION OF THE AUTHORS BILL. SAYING NONE ANY QUESTIONS OF THIS ARE YEAR CURRY. NAM THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE AMENDMENTS BECAUSE I WAS HAVING A REALLY HARD TIME WITH THIS OF THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TAKING THAT MAN I THINK. NUMBER ONE SAFETY SAFETY SAFETY AND WE SHOULDN'T AMEND RIGHT OUT HERE IN SACRAMENTO YOU SEE PEOPLE JUST ZOOMING DOWN THE STREETS NOT PAYING ATTENTION AND THEY'VE GOT A LOT OF DISTRACTIONS IN THE CAR CELL PHONES OR WHATEVER SO. BUT EVERY CAN DO TO MAKE SURE THE PUBLIC SAFETY THANKS VERY MUCH FOR BRINGING FORWARD. IT WAS BAKER THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND THANK YOU ALSO FOR TAKING THE AMENDMENTS AND PARTICULARLY. UP AS THE TWO PARTS FIRST IS THERE ARE OTHER ELEMENTS OF THE TRAFFIC STUDY THAT'S REQUIRED NOW THAT MAY BE FLAWED NO RESTRICTIONS ON WHAT AT WHAT TIME OF DAY IT CAN GO. INTO THE STUDY CAN BE CONDUCTED WHAT TIME OF DAY CAN'T BE CONDUCTED AND WE'VE SEEN THAT. IN MY OWN COMMUNITY WHICH DOES HAVE RAILROADS. AND THAT PEOPLE ARE BEING DRIVEN TO TO BYPASS MAJOR USING VARIOUS APPS TO BYPASS MAJOR THOROUGHFARES AND. IT'S MORE SOPHISTICATED THAN JUST ONE SOLUTION AND MAKING SURE THAT A A STUDY THAT IS. THOROUGH AND REALLY LOOKS AT MORE ASPECTS OF HOW SPEED LIMITS ARE CHOSEN I THINK IS GOING TO BE IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT'S NOT ALLOWING OUR LOCAL COMMUNITY. TO HAVE THE THE BREADTH OF TOOLS AVAILABLE TO THEM AND EVEN THE STUDY NOT. POSSIBLE TO BE CONDUCTED AT A FLEXIBILITY OF TIME OF DATA SHOWING PEOPLE ARE YOU SET SO I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU DOING THAT AND. AN ABSOLUTE RIGHT TO GIVE MANY. EXAMPLES OF NON RURAL ROADS BUT ADAM I LIKE THAT THE AMENDMENTS WILL ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN. ALSO AND MAKING SURE THAT. AS YOU AS YOU LOOK AT THIS THE. THE ABILITY OF LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO BE ABLE TO DETERMINE. THEREFORE HAVE MUCH MORE SAY. IN THE SPEED LIMITS IN THE AREA I HOPE WILL CONTINUE TO BE THE GOAL. WITH WHATEVER TOOLS THEY ARE BUT I ENCOURAGE YOU TO KEEP UP ON THAT AFTER THE STUDY IN THE PROCESS GOES FORWARD THANK YOU. Q.. SO WE HAVE A. WE'RE MOTION WITH NO MOTION. MISTER BERMAN I CARE CURRY SECOND. MS RIVER WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. JUST I REALLY APPRECIATE AGAIN YOUR WORKING WITH ME ON THIS IS A BIG ISSUE I KNOW IT'S GONNA TAKE TIME AND.

NUMBER SEVENTEEN FILE ITEM IT IS AB TWENTY EIGHT SEVENTY SEVEN PLEASE PROCEED WE READY SIR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. AB TWENTY EIGHT SEVENTY SEVEN IS A SIMPLE MEASURE. WHICH WOULD REQUIRE THE A ARE BE TO DEVELOP A PROGRAM TO PROVIDE GRANTS TO RURAL COUNTIES. OR PUBLIC TRIED TO. TRANSIT AGENCIES AND RURAL CONTIES. FOR THE PURCHASE OF CLEAN VEHICLE. UTILIZING GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND ORG GIGI R. F. MONIES. THESE VEHICLES WILL OPERATE. AS NON EMERGENCY MEDICAL TRANSPORTATION FOR SENIORS AND THE DISABLED LIVING. WITHIN RURAL AREAS. SENIORS AND DISABLED PEOPLE LIVING IN RURAL AREAS ARE OFTEN. WITH THAT I ASKED FOR AN AYE VOTE WITH ME TODAY IS AND WARREN. FROM THE CALIFORNIA SENIOR LEGISLATURE WHO IS SPONSORING THE BILL. AND. GOOD AFTERNOON. SO YOU GET. AHS BEEN AN INTERESTING AFTERNOON. MY BILLS NOTHING LIKE. THE TECHNICAL STUFF THAT YOU JUST HEARD. CSL. OF COURSE IS. WHERE INTERESTED IN THE SAFETY? AND THE HEALTH OF SENIORS. I AND CALIFORNIA HAS MANY SENIORS PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES ARE WHO SUFFER FROM CHRONIC SERIOUS ILLNESSES OR MENTAL IMPAIRMENTS. THAT LIMIT THEIR MOBILITY AND THEY ALSO LIVE IN RURAL MOUNTAIN FOR DESERT COMMUNITIES. LACK OF TRANSPORTATION OR ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE SERVICES IS A PRIME CONCERN. DUE TO LONG DISTANCES TO THE HEALTH CARE FACILITIES. OUTSIDE THE REGION. MISSING MEDICAL CARE. WILL LEAD TO REDUCED HEALTH ANY INCREASED ACUTE CARE BECAUSE. IMAGINE IF YOU WILL. pTHAT YOU'RE SEVENTY YEARS OLD. THAT YOU HAVE BEEN DISCHARGED FROM ACUTE CARE. HOSPITAL HOSPITAL TO YOUR HOME IN A RURAL AREA. YOU'VE BEEN ADVISED THAT YOU NEED FOLLOW UP APPOINTMENTS TREATMENTS FOR THIS CHRONIC ILLNESS. NEED YOU KNOW YOUR FAMILY MEMBERS FOR A MYRIAD OF REASONS HAVE TRANSPORTATION FOR THE FOLLOW UP APPOINTMENTS. WHICH ARE OFTEN FIFTY. MORE MILES AWAY. WHAT DO YOU GONNA DO? FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS. SOMETIMES THEY'RE AVAILABLE. ONE RESIDENT MENDOCINO COUNTY SAYS WE HAVE A VOLUNTEER ORGANIZATION THAT PROVIDES THE SERVICE. BUT WE'RE HAVING PROBLEMS RECRUITING DRIVERS PARTLY BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT PUT THE WEAR AND TEAR ON THEIR PRIVATE VEHICLES. DO HAVE LOCAL TRANSIT SERVICE IN YOUR AREA OFTEN NO. DEPARTMENTS ON AGING. THEY HAVE CONTRACTOR FUNDS OF. VERY FEW AVAILABLE FOR CONTRACTOR FOR TRANSPORTATION. ALL THEIR BUDGET MONIES IS NEEDED FOR DIRECT SERVICES PROGRAMS. AN EXCEPTION HOWEVER. IN SAN BERNADINE KNOWS RURAL EASTERN AREA. THE COMMUNITY HAS A SANTA BUT THEY CALL I'M RIDER CENTER. VOLUNTEER PROGRAM WHICH RIDERS MUST IN ROLE. THEY MUST RECRUIT THEIR OWN VOLUNTEER DRIVERS. AND THEY RECEIVE MILEAGE REIMBURSEMENTS TO GIVE TO THOSE DRIVERS. IN MANY CALIPHAL OF CALIFORNIANS SMALLER COMMUNITIES. AND THAT'S OVER HALF OF OUR COUNTIES. SERVICED SENIORS IS UNKNOWN. BUT WITH GOVERNMENT POLICIES ENCOURAGING SENIORS TO AGING PLACE. AND WITH THE LACK OF HOUSING ALTERNATIVES. THEY'RE CLUSTERS OF VERY SMALL RESIDENTIAL ENCLAVES OFTEN WITH VERY POOR RESIDENTS. THROUGHOUT OUR VERY RURAL AREAS. WE FEEL THAT THESE INDIVIDUALS DESERVES SERVICE HOLES. THE TRANSPORTATION PROBLEMS LIKE AND THEN THE SCENE O. COUNTIES HAVE STEMMED FROM LOW. RURAL LOW DENSITY POPULATION BASE AND THERE SEPARATED BY MANY MILES. MOUNTAINS AND LAKES. MANY SENIORS THERE NEED TRANSPORTATION TO FAR OFF LOCATIONS SUCH AS SANTA ROSA AND SAN FRANCISCO FROM THAT SPECIALIZE. MEDICAL TREATMENTS. TRANSPORTATION BETWEEN THE TOWNS AND CITIES WITHIN THE COUNTY SAYS DIFFICULT AND EXPENSIVE. BECAUSE OF THOSE JUST. ONE CSL MEMBER STATES FROM ASSEMBLY DISTRICT TWO. IN PRACTICE THE MORE URBANIZED AREAS ARE SERVICED. STATEWIDE NON EMERGENCY TRANSPORT SERVICES FOR HIGHER. ARE PRIMARILY AVAILABLE NEAR URBAN SUBURBAN AREAS SUCH AS ORANGE COUNTY. AND SAN DIEGO CARE. IN THE NORTH THESE SERVICES ARE AVAILABLE TO AREAS FROM SAN JOSE TO MARIN COUNTIES. AND EAST. TO ALAMEDA AND CONTRA COSTA COUNTIES. MOST OF THESE PRIVATE COMPANIES APPEAR TO USE MODIFIED AMBULANCE VEHICLES. THE WHOLE A SMALL NUMBER OF PEOPLE. HOWEVER ONE EXCEPTION. IS MEDI VAN I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE HEARD OF IT. OPERATED BY STANISLAUS. TRANSIT WHICH IS AN INEXPENSIVE RESERVATION ONLY SERVICE. FROM MODESTO. TWO OAKLAND SAN FRANCISCO IN PALO ALTO. ONE USER OF THIS SERVICE RELATED TO ME. THAT SHE MUST DRIVE MY GET TRANSPORTATION FROM HOME HOME INTO LONELY COUNTY. TO MODESTO. I CATCH THE VAN. TO GET TO UC SAN FRANCISCO TO MEET WITH HER CARDIOLOGIST. IF ONE IS NOT FEELING WELL. HE WHEN THAT SERVICE WILL BE DIFFICULT. GETTING OLD. IS INEPT INEVITABLE. BEING OLD AND POOR. IS A CHALLENGE. BEING SICK IS A GREATER CHALLENGE. BEING OLD. SEC. AND LIVING IN REMOTE ISOLATED AREAS CAN BE A BURDEN. BUT HAVING TRANSPORTATION. FOR ACCESSING YOUR MEDICAL NEEDS. LESSONS THE CHALLENGES. WE'RE PROPOSING. THIS MEDICAL TRANSPORT SOLUTION. THROUGH THE PURCHASE OF ENERGY RENEWABLE VEHICLES. FROM THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND. THAT WILL ADDRESS THE RULES SENIOR AND DISABLED COMMUNITIES NEEDS. AND CONTINUES TO ACHIEVE SWEEPSTAKES GOAL OF REDUCING ADMISSIONS. EMISSIONS. WE HOPE THAT YOU AGREE. AND VOTE TO PASS THIS. WELL SAID. ANY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC THAT WOULD LIKE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE AUTHORS BILL. SEEING NONE ANY MEMBERS OF PUBLIC THE LIKE TO TEST MY IN OPPOSITION TO THE AUTHORS BILL OR VOICE OUR OPINION. SEEING NONE HE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE HAVE THIS YEAR CURRY. I'M ASSEMBLYMEMBER MATHIS THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU. I WORK DONE THESE KIND OF PROBLEMS IN MY COMMUNITY AND RURAL YOLO COUNTY FOR A LONG TIME WE NEVER REALLY COULD MAKE IT WORK. ENDED UP BUYING A USED VEHICLE WHICH PROBABLY WE SHOULD KNOW BY IN THE LONG RUN. BET IT SOME YOU KNOW. AS WE GET OLDER TRANSIT IS THE NUMBER ONE THING AND FOR US TO STAY IN OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES. IS IMPORTANT BY WHICH OUR CARS TAKEN AWAY AND YOUR SHIPPED OFF TO SOME. SENIOR HOUSING OUTSIDE OF YOUR AREA IT'S REALLY UPSETTING AND TO TRANSPORTATION IS THE LINK TO KEEP THESE PEOPLE THE COMMUNITIES KEEPS THEM HELP HAPPY HEALTHY SOMEONE SO FORTH SO. I WANNA THANK YOU TODAY FOR GREEN THIS FOR. AND. I'LL BE SUPPORTING A BILL THAT. THANK YOU YOU KNOW THE QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE OF THE AUTHOR. SEEING NONE. THIS MATHIS LIKE CLOSE.
