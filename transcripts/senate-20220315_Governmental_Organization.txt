HI BECKER HI GORGEOUS BRADFORD GLAZER WESO JONES JONES HI KEN LONGER CAN LONGER I MELINDA'S MELENDEZ ACCORDING TO YOU KNOW RUBIO. RUBIO I WILL I WILL I AM CONCERNED. THAT BILL HAS ENOUGH VOTES BUT- TALK CALL FOR ABSENT MEMBERS- WE WILL BEGIN THE FILE AND I'M NUMBER ONE SP EIGHT FORTY SIX WHICH IS MY BILL SO I WILL PASS THE GAVEL NOW TO OUR VICE CHAIR CENTERED THE DEAN OF THE SENATE SENATOR NIELSEN THANK YOU R CHAIRMAN AND WE WILL NOW. PRESENT S. B. EIGHT FOUR SIX IS OUR FIRST BILL TODAY THE CHAIRMAN PHIL. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. I'D LIKE TO BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS LISTED IN THE ANALYSIS. S. B. EIGHT FORTY SIX FIRST IS TO EXPAND ON LAST YEAR'S COCKTAIL TO GO BILL BY ADDING BARS TO THOSE PROVISIONS REMOVING THE MEAL REQUIREMENT AND ALLOWING FOR DELIVERY OF COCKTAILS DIRECT TO CONSUMER STORE. WITH THOSE CHANGES THAT PORTION OF S. B. EIGHT FORTY SIX WOULD BE IDENTICAL TO MY BILL SB THREE EIGHTY NINE FROM LAST YEAR WHICH UNANIMOUSLY WAS PASSED IN THIS COMMITTEE. THE ABILITY TO INCLUDE ALCOHOLIC DRINKS HAS BEEN A LIFELINE TO OUR RESTAURANT INDUSTRY DURING COVERT NINETEEN. THIS BILL SIMPLY SEEKS TO CONTINUE ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL ELEMENTS OF THE EMERGENCY REGULATORY PANDEMIC RELIEF. IN ADDITION THIS BILL REQUIRES THIRD PARTY DELIVERY COMPANIES WHO ARE DELIVERING ALCOHOL ON BEHALF OF THE LICENSEE TO OBTAIN A PERMIT FROM ABC DEPARTMENT OF ABC. AS THE ANALYSIS POINTS OUT UNDER CURRENT LAW THE DEPARTMENT OF A. B. C. HAS NO STATUTORY OVERSIGHT OVER THIRD PARTY DELIVERY COMPANIES THAT DELIVER ALCOHOL THAT'S THE STATE OF AFFAIRS TODAY. THE DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN VERY CLEAR THAT HE CANNOT SANCTION THIRD PARTY DELIVERY COMPANIES AND THEREFORE RESPONSIBILITY IN ANY POTENTIAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY. IS WITH THAT WITH THE DRIVER- IN WITH THE LICENSEE THAT SOLD ALCOHOL THAT AND THAT IS CURRENT LAW. SB FORTY SIX SOLVES THIS PROBLEM BY SHIFTING SOME RESPONSIBILITY TO THE THIRD PARTY DELIVERY COMPANIES AND PROVIDING THE DEPARTMENT BBC WITH OVERSIGHT OF THOSE ALCOHOLDELIVERIES. ONCE AGAIN WE WANT TO PROVIDE THE DEPARTMENT OF ABC WITH OVERSIGHT OVER THOSE ALCOHOL DELIVERIES. I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR THAT THIS DOES NOT LEGALIZE THE DELIVERY OF ALCOHOL BY THIRD PARTY DELIVERY COMPANIES BY EITHER GROCERY STORES OR EVEN RESTAURANTS. THAT'S THE ANALYSIS POINTS OUT CURRENT LAW ALREADY ALLOWS ALL TYPES OF ALCOHOL TO BE DELIVERED BY THIRD PARTY DELIVERY COMPANY. ON BEHALF OF GROCERY STORES IN THE ABILITY OF THESE COMPANIES TO DELIVER WHAT A BEER ON BEHALF OF RESTAURANTS BILL DOES IS PROVIDE A COMMON SENSE APPROACH TO GIVE THE DEPARTMENT BBC THE NECESSARY OVERSIGHT TO ENSURE THAT DELIVERIES ARE BEING DONE IN A RESPONSIBLE MANNER. THAT PROTECTS AGAINST UNDER AGE DRINKING AND OVER INTOXICATION. SPECIFICALLY THIS BILL REQUIRES DELIVERY DRIVERS WHO ARE DELIVERING ALCOHOL TO COMPLETED TRAINING IT MAKES IT CLEAR THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF ABC CAN SUSPEND OR REVOKE A CONSUMER DELIVERY SERVICE PERMIT WHEN CIRCUMSTANCES WARRANT SUCH DISCIPLINE IN IT AUTHORIZES ABC. TO IMPOSE FINES ON THE HOLDER OF THE PERMIT. BEFORE I CLOSE I WANT TO ADDRESS THE LETTER OF OPPOSITION THAT LABOR SENT OUT FRIDAY AFTERNOON. NOT ONLY WAS THIS SENT OUT AFTER THE ANALYSIS WAS COMPLETED BUT WAS SET MORE THAN TWO MONTHS AFTER THE BILL WAS INTRODUCED. THAT ALONE IS FRUSTRATING. WHAT MAKES IT WORSE IS THE CLAIMS MADE BY THAT LETTER. ARE MISLEADING MISLEADING TO SAY THE LEAST IT OFTEN. SO OFTEN TIMES SIMPLY FACTUALLY INCORRECT YES B. E. FORTY SIX DOES NOT SHIP LIABILITIES FROM RETAILERS TO DRIVERS AS THE OPPOSITION CLAIMED IN THEIR LETTER. AS THE ANALYSIS POINTS OUT THE BILL WOULD SHIP SOME RESPONSIBILITIES FROM RETAILERS AND RESTAURANTS THE THIRD PARTY DELIVERY COMPANIES NOT DRIVERS. THE LETTER CLAIMS THAT THIS BILL IS UNCLEAR WHO THE PENALTY FALLS ON AGAIN IT'S THE ANALYSIS POINTS OUT THESE FALLS WOULD FALL ON THIRD PARTY DELIVERY COMPANIES THAT'S ON PAGE FOUR LINE SEVENTEEN AND IT MAKES IT PERFECTLY CLEAR. FOR THOSE WHO DON'T BELIEVE ME I WELCOME THEM TO READ THE BILL OR READ THE ANALYSIS OF THE BILL IF THAT'S NOT ENOUGH I SUGGEST REACHING OUT TO THE DEPARTMENT OF ABC SO THE DEPARTMENT CAN PROVIDE THEM WITH AN UNBIASED OPINION. THE LETTER ALSO CLAIMS IN ANOTHER STATE. THE EXTENT ALCOHOL TO GO LEGISLATURE LEGISLATORS HAVE INSISTED ON EMPLOYEE STATUS. THEN USE A BILL PASSED IN GEORGIA IS AN EXAMPLE OF SUCH CLAIMS. BY COMMITTEE STAFF SPENT TIME OVER THE LAST COUPLE DAYS REVIEWING EACH D. EIGHT SEVENTY NINE THE GEORGIA BILL THAT OPERATES ALCOHOL TO GO IN MEMBERS THE BILL DOES NO SUCH THING. WHAT GEORGIA BILL DOES IT'S THE SAME THING THAT HAS TO BE EIGHT FORTY SIX WEEKS TO DO. IT ALLOWS FOR ALCOHOL TO BE DELIVERED BY EITHER AN EMPLOYEE OR A LICENSEE OR BY A THIRD PARTY DELIVERY COMPANY. REGARDLESS OF WHAT THE GEORGIA BUILD US I'VE ALWAYS VIEWED CALIFORNIA IS A LEADER NOT A FOLLOWER. BUT MEMBERS ARE GOING TO BE VERY CLEAR THE MY FRUSTRATION IS NOT WITH THE FACT THAT THERE IS OPPOSITION. TO MY BILL. I WELCOME ANY AND ALL FAIR CRITICISM. WHAT I DON'T APPRECIATE IT FOR CERTAIN GROUPS TO USE THEIR POLITICAL CLOUT. TO MISLEAD MEMBERS AND MAKE A MOCKERY OUT OF OUR LEGISLATIVE PROCESS. FINALLY MEMBERS THE LETTER ARGUES THAT IN THE ABSENCE OF EMPLOYEE STATUS THE LEGISLATURE MUST ENSURE PENALTIES DO NOT FALL ON THE BACKS OF VULNERABLE WORKERS AND THAT THERE'S NEEDS TO BE A ROBUST LICENSING STRUCTURE SO THE COMPANY'S LICENSES CONSUMER DELIVERY SERVICE IN THE STATE. ACTUALLY KERRY THE LIABILITY. I AGREE WITH THAT STATEMENT BECAUSE THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT MY BILL DOES WITH ME TODAY IS KATIE HANSEN ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION AND JOHN LATIMER ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA RETAILERS ASSOCIATION. NOW THEN PROCEED TO WITNESSES AND SUPPORT OTHERS AND YOU MENTIONED MR- KATIE HANSON. AND IF YOU HAVE ONE OTHER ONE MISTER JOHN LATIMER. MISS HANSON ARE YOU ON THE LINE. I'M YES SENATOR IN HERE IN THE CHAMBERS GOOD MORNING. PLEASE PROCEED GOOD MORNING CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS KATIE HANSON THE CALIFORNIA RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION IS IN STRONG SUPPORT OF EIGHTY EIGHT FOUR SIX THE PROPOSAL BEFORE YOU WOULD SIMPLY RESTORE THE ABILITY OF RESTAURANT PATRONS TO PURCHASE COCKTAILS FROM A RESTAURANT AS PART OF THEIR DELIVERY ORDER. THE SAME POLICY WAS ALLOWED UNDER TEMPORARY ABC EMERGENCY RELIEF AT THE OUTSET OF THE PANDEMIC AND HAS SINCE CEASED GIVEN THAT THE SAME ABC REGULATORY RELIEF WAS IN PLACE FOR OVER A YEAR THE POLICY MODERNIZATION IN EIGHTY EIGHT FOUR SIX HAS HAD A GOOD LONG TRIAL PERIOD. PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC. IT'S ACTUALLY ACTING AS A SUCCESSFUL PILOT PROJECT. IN ADDITION TO RESTORING THE PRIVILEGE OF ALLOWING COCKTAILS TO BE PROVIDED FROM RESTAURANTS VIA DELIVERY. EIGHTY EIGHT FOUR SIX ALSO EXPANDS CONSUMER CHOICE BY NOT REQUIRING TAKEOUT OR DELIVERY ORDERS AND THESE PRODUCTS TO A COMPANY AND MEAL. EIGHTY EIGHT FOUR SIX EVEN GOES ONE STEP FURTHER AND I WAS APPROPRIATE PROTECTIONS FOR PUBLIC SAFETY. THE POLICY WAS APPROVED BY THIS COMMITTEE LAST YEAR AS WELL AS BY THE FULL SENATE BODY. WE WOULD LIKE TO THANK SENATOR DODD FOR HIS LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE AND RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT HERE TODAY FOR EIGHTY EIGHT FOUR SIX. I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU MS HANSON HAS WRITTEN TO MISTER JOHN LATIMER. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS JOHN LATIMER ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA RETAILERS ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA'S RETAILERS HAVE BEEN USING THIRD PARTY DELIVERY COMPANIES TO MAKE DELIVERIES INCLUDING ALCOHOL SALES FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS. AS THE CHAIRMAN SAID CONTRARY TO THE OPPOSITION'S POSITION THIS IS NOT A NEW AUTHORITY AND THIS IS NOT NEW AUTHORITY BEING GRANTED THIS BILL THIS BILL ACTUALLY CLOSES AN IMPORTANT ENFORCEMENT GAP IN THE ABC'S OF THE WORDING. BECAUSE THIRD PARTY DELIVERY COMPANIES ARE NOT ALCOHOL LICENSEES THE ABC CANNOT AFFORD ENFORCE AGAINST THE COMPANY. IF A DELIVERY IS MADE TO A MINOR INTOXICATED PERSON IRONICALLY THE ONLY OPTIONS THEN LEFT IT TO THE A. B. C. R. TO ENFORCE AGAINST THE RETAILER EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE MADE NO MISTAKE IN THE PROCESS OR THE DRIVER THEMSELVES. THERE IS AUTHORITY UNDER CURRENT LAW TO ENFORCE AGAINST THE DRIVER THAT'S NOT CREATED BY THIS THAT'S IN THE PENAL CODE WHEN PROVIDING ALCOHOL TO A MINOR IS AGAINST THE LAW. SO EVEN THOUGH THE OPPOSITION IS CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT THIS BILL MAY DO RELATIVE TO THE DRIVERS IT ACTUALLY HAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO PROTECT THE DRIVERS AND AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO PROTECT THE RETAIL COMMUNITY AND MOVE THE RESPONSIBILITY WHERE IT BELONGS TO A THIRD PARTY DELIVERY COMPANY. IF A MISTAKE IS MADE. SO THIS BILL SPECIFICALLY BY CLOSING THE GAP REQUIRES COMPANIES TO SECURE A PERMIT FROM THE A. B. C. IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO BE A THIRD PARTY COMPANY DELIVERING ALL CALL. THESE COMPANIES HAVE TO FOLLOW A PRESCRIBED SET OF POLICIES AND TRAINING REQUIREMENTS THAT A FUTURE DELIVERY MISTAKES ARE FIRST MINIMIZED AND IF THEY'RE MADE THEY CAN BE PURSUED AGAINST THE DELIVERY COMPANY THEMSELVES. THIS IS AGAIN A POLICY BEING ADOPTED IN NUMEROUS STATES. EVERY PARTNERSHIPS CONTINUE TO BE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO RETELLING CALIFORNIA YES THIS IS THIS IS INCREASED IN THE PANDEMIC BUT IT WAS ALREADY. THEIR RELATIONSHIP AND IN EXISTENCE WELL BEFORE THE PANDEMIC WE JUST GREW TO RELY ON IT MORE AND MORE BALL THAT'S COMPANIES AND AS CONSUMERS. C. R. A. FEELS VERY STRONGLY TO DELIVER COMPANIES. OUR PARTNERS BUT THEY SHOULD ALSO HAVE APPROPRIATE STATE PERMITS IT HERE TO OUR STATE TRAINING REQUIREMENTS AND THAT SHOULD THEY MAKE A MISTAKE. THOSE COMPANIES SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE BY THE ABC FOR THESE REASONS WE ARE DRIVING. THANK YOU MR LATIMER DO WE HAVE ANYONE ELSE. IN THE CHAMBER WISHING TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT. GLAD WE HAVE A MEMBER OF. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN- I JUST WANNA COMMIT THE AUTHOR BECAUSE I KNOW THAT YOU WORKED A LOT ON THIS BILL TO TRY AND. I'M SORRY TO THE POSITION. NO NO NO NO I'M SORRY IT IS THE OPPOSITION THAT'S TO SPEAK NOT A MEMBER MODERATOR DO YOU HAVE ANYONE ON THE LINE WISHING TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IF YOU WISH TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT PLEASE PRESS ONE TO INDIA TO KEEP THAT PRESS ONE THEN ZERO. HER FIRST PLANE NUMBER SEVENTEEN LINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. HEY IS THIS GOVERNANCE I HAD SOME TROUBLE GETTING THE BOTTOM LINE AM I IN GOVERNANCE. THE GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE AND THE CALIFORNIA SENATE IT IS I WANT TO BE SURE I'M IN THE RIGHT PLACE- GOOD OKAY WELL I THINK TO SUPPORT ENDING THE EMERGENCY BUT I'M TOTALLY CONFUSED BECAUSE YOU PEOPLE ARE YOU ASKING ON AND ON ABOUT ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES WHILE CALIFORNIA DIES AND WE DIDN'T UNDER THE- THE GAS TAX YESTERDAY WHAT ARE YOU PEOPLE DOING DOWN THERE. SUCH A WASTE TAXPAYER DOLLARS IS OF THE WASTE OF OUR MONEY AND- COMMENTING ON THE- I SAID EVERY MAN WOULD YOU COMMENT ON. THE BILL. SPEAK TO THE BILL SHE'S. HE'S ON THE OTHER. ONE MOMENT PLEASE. MODERATOR WE'RE LOOKING FOR THOSE ON THE LINE WHO MAY BE WISHING TO SUPPORT THE LEGISLATION DO YOU HAVE ANYONE IN Q. WISHING TO SUPPORT. WE HAVE ONE ADDITIONAL LINE LINE TWENTY FOUR YOUR LINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD SOMETHING LIKE PUBLIC COMMENT ABOUT A FIAT FIVE BOATING. I BELIEVE THE STATE OF EMERGENCY SOMETHING LIKE WITHOUT HAVING TO GO WRONG WITH A MAN. THROWING BEER WE'RE ON S. B. EIGHT FOUR SIX SENATOR DODD. WE HAVE NO ADDITIONAL LINES AT THIS TIME. WE SHOULD HAVE YEAH. MA'AM THIS IS NOT THE BILL THAT YOU'RE WISHING TO TESTIFY ON. MODERATOR DO WE HAVE ANYONE ELSE IN QUEUE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF EIGHT FOUR SIX. WE HAVE NO ADDITIONAL LINES AT THE TIME ALL RIGHT. DO WE HAVE ANY OPPOSITION. IN THE CHAMBER. IT LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE SOMEBODY UP THERE PLEASE PROCEED MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN NOT OVERLOOK TO RECORD WE HAVE A UNITED FOOD AND COMMERCIAL WORKERS. REGRETTABLE OPPOSITION FIRST OF ALL LET ME START BY- APOLOGIZING FOR THE LATE SUBMISSION OF OUR OPPOSITION LETTER LATE LAST WEEK- THE LETTER WAS SUBMITTED AS SOON AS THE BILL WAS. NOTICED FOR HEARING A SECOND I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT- ALTHOUGH THE LETTER WHAT WAS SUBMITTED LATE. ANOTHER YOU HAVE TO GO BE ANOTHER AND TEACHERS THE LABOR FOR OTHERS HAVE BEEN AN ONGOING DISCUSSIONS WITH YOUR OFFICE AROUND THIS POLICY WITH YOU AND YOUR STAFF- TO PRINEVILLE US- PREPARED TO CONFER ABOUT THE MERITS OF THIS YEAR'S BILL. FIRST OF ALL I JUST LIKE TO SAY THAT. THE LEGAL AND- I THINK IT'S UNDISPUTED THAT THE LEGAL. AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORK IN THIS IN THIS AREA IS UNSETTLED- YOUR BILL WAS PASSED LAST YEAR MR DODD. SIGNED INTO LAW WENT INTO EFFECT JANUARY FIRST HAS A FIVE YEAR SUNSET. PRESIDENT TWENTY TWO. WHICH IF IT'S RATED THE CUSTOMER RESPONDED SUPERIOR. IS ALSO IN DISPUTE IT'S CURLY LITIGATION NOT CLEAR WHAT THOSE FINAL RESULTS WILL BE OF THAT I BRING THAT UP ONLY IN THE CONTEXT OF THIS NOTION OF WHO IS RESPONSIBLE WHO WHO IS LIABLE WHO SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR MISTAKES. AMERICAN JURISPRUDENCE CALIFORNIA LAW HAS BEEN CONSISTENT WHEN IT COMES TO PRODUCT LIABILITY. WE THOUGHT WE'VE ALWAYS FELT THAT THE CHAIN OF LIABILITY RUNS ALL THE WAY THROUGH. FROM FROM THE PRODUCTION OF THE PRODUCT ALL THE WAY TO THE CONCERNS OF THE PRODUCT. THIS BILL CONTINUES TO EVISCERATE THAT CHAIN OF LIABILITY THE CHALLENGE BECOMES NUMBER ONE AS BEEN STATED BY THE AUTHOR. WHAT HAPPENS. VOCALIST SOLD TO MINORS I UNDERSTAND THAT THE RETAILERS DON'T WANT THE LIABILITY. BUT THAT'S NOT THE WAY PRODUCT LIABILITY WORKS IN THIS COUNTRY IF THERE IS THE REASON THAT THE CHANGES. THE CHAIN REMAINS UNBROKEN IS TO ASSURE. THE VICTIMS HAVE A RECOURSE THAT THAT THAT IS THE ENTIRE PURPOSE OF PRODUCT LIABILITY AND THIS BILL WOULD RESTRICT THAT FINALLY I WOULD LIKE TO SAY ON BEHALF OF THE MEMBERS OF U. F. C. W. WE ARE VERY MUCH CONCERNED. ABOUT THE CHERRY PICKING OF PRODUCTS FROM GROCERY STORES. THIS THIS HASN'T A DENTIST IT'S BEGINNING TO HAVE A DEVASTATING EFFECT ON THE GROCERY STORES AND THEIR PROFITABILITY THE DELIVERY COMPANIES. CAN HIRE THESE DRIVERS THEY DON'T CHARACTERIZE THEM AS EMPLOYEES. THEY HAVE MAJOR ADVANTAGES WHEN IT COMES TO THE ECONOMICS OF THE SITUATION. AND THE GROCERY STORES ARE HIGHLY DEPENDENT. ON FOOT TRAFFIC COMING TO STORES IF YOU IF YOU GO TO A GROCERY STORE YOU KNOW THAT. IF YOU'RE GOING TO BUY A BUY ONE ITEM TO CARMEL. YOU NEVER LEAVE ON ONE ITEM. HE ALSO NOTICED THAT IN GROCERY STORES. ALCOHOL IS NOT PLACED UP FROM THE STORE I'LL CALL A STRATEGICALLY PLACED AT THE BACK OF STORE SO PEOPLE AREN'T GOING TO STORES. SEVEN THE FACT THAT CUSTOMERS MAY NO LONGER HAVE COME INTO THE GROCERY STORES HAVE A DEVASTATING IMPACT.ON THESE GO TO STORES AND AN EMERGENCY W. RESPECT FOR MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS CONVEY RESPECT. WE HAVE FOR NOT THE NOBLE. THANK YOU. DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER. PRIMARY WITNESSES. IN OPPOSITION. HI YES THANK YOU THANK YOU THE CHAIR AND RANKING MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE- MY NAME IS CARSON BENOWITZ FREDERICKS I'M THE RESEARCH DIRECTOR ALCOHOL JUSTICE IN SAN RAFAEL. I RESPECTFULLY ASK THAT YOU VOTE NO ON SB EIGHT FORTY SIX. I DO FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE SEEN IT HERE BEFORE AND WE'VE READ A LITANY. OF FACTS ABOUT THE HARMS OF ALCOHOL IN CALIFORNIA- I'M GONNA DO IT AGAIN BUT YOU KNOW AT SOME POINT THEY SHOULD BE. INCLUDED IN EVERY DIRECTORY BILL THAT COMES BEFORE- THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD COME FROM DPH NOT US. BUT THE BIG ONE I WANT TO POINT OUT IS YOU KNOW IT YOU'VE HEARD ME SAY. THAT THERE HAVE BEEN TEN THOUSAND DEATHS ANNUALLY IN CALIFORNIA- I'M ALCOHOL HARM WELL IT'S- THAT'S BEEN- THAT'S BEEN REVISED IT'S NOW ELEVEN THOUSAND- IT'S STILL GOING UP- WE KNOW THAT- DEATHS FROM ALCOHOL RELATED DISEASE ARE SPIKING ESPECIALLY IN YOUNG AMERICANS. SO WE KNOW WHAT ALCOHOL HARM CONTINUES TO BE AN ESCALATING. NOT DIMINISHING PROBLEM. HOT AND LOCKDOWN LOCKDOWN HAS EXACERBATED THIS WE KNOW THE FIVE YEAR ROLLING AVERAGE ALKYLATED CRASHES ROSE IN TWENTY TWENTY. DESPITE LIMITATIONS ON MOVEMENT AND WE KNOW FROM A- UNIVERSES KAGO ANALYSIS THAT. THE OBSERVED RATES RATE OBSERVED RATE OF INCREASE IN ALCOHOL RELATED DEATHS- RIGHT. 25% MORE THAN IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN. BASED ON THE- BEFORE LOCKED. HI WHAT HAPPENED DURING THIS TIME WHILE WE DID YOU WRAP IT UP SIR. YOU'RE RIGHT PLEASE YOUR RAMBLING A BIT STAY ON POINT PLEASE. OKAY. THESE HARMS OCCURRED WHILE WE WERE INCREASING DELIVERY WHY WE'RE DEREGULATING ALCOHOL AND WE ARE NOW TRYING TO MAKE. THESE ITEMS PERMANENT SPECIFICALLY TO THIS BILL- WE HAVE CONCERNS THAT THIS IS NOT JUST CHANGE WHERE THE LIABILITY IS THIS REMOVES LARGE SECTIONS OF LIABILITY THERE IS ACTUALLY RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR CALL SERVICE TO NOT SELL IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS BESIDES JUST UNDER AGE BRANCH YOU WOULD BE DANGEROUS SOME POP HAPPENED UP. THERE IN THIS. PLEASE WRAP IT UP YOU'VE HAD A LOT OF VERBIAGE OF COURSE HI AND THEN THIS ALSO CREATES THE- SITUATION WHICH WE HAVE GOES BARS ACTUALLY RUN WITH SKELETON STAFFS REDUCED THE NUMBER OF POOR BOYS THEY CAN HAVE UNDER A LIQUOR LICENSE. AND HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO ACCOUNTABILITY FOR WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WHAT THEY'RE SELLING GOES OUT THERE. AGAIN EVERY BUILD LIKE THIS SIR I SEE THAT BUT- AUSTIN WE JUST LIGHTLY ASK YOU VOTE NO. ON SB.

THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN- A YES AT FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR BECAUSE I KNOW THAT LAST YEAR I BELIEVE IT WAS LAST YEAR YOU WORKED- REALLY DILIGENTLY TO ADDRESS SOME OF MY CONCERNS- IN PARTICULAR THE ISSUE FOR ME LAST. TIME WAS PRETTY SAFE AROUND CHILDREN GETTING THEIR HANDS ON ALL CALL HALL AND I THINK. YOU'VE A TACKLE THAT ISSUE IN PARTICULAR BY ADDING A NEW CONSUMER TRAINING FACTOR PARTY DELIVERY WHICH INCLUDES- EDUCATING ON THE SOCIAL IMPACTS OF ALCOHOL AS WELL AS THE IMPACT ON THE BODY- FOCUSING ON STATE AND FEDERAL. LAW AS WELL AS- OUR LEARNING TECHNIQUES TO PREVENT THE CELL TOO INTOXICATED INDIVIDUAL CELL I THINK THAT WAS AN IMPORTANT PART AND EVEN THOUGH IT DID PASS YOU NONE OF MYSTERY FOR ME- IT WAS PART OF THE EMERGENCY PANDEMIC RELIEF THAT WE WERE DOING FOR BUSINESSES AND I STILL BELIEVE WE CAN DO THAT. UNFORTUNATES NOT SOMETHING I BELIEVE YOU DETERMINE I THINK IT WAS AN AMENDMENT THAT WAS ASKED OF YOU WHICH WAS TO REMOVE THAT DELIVERY OF FOOD ALONG WITH THE ALCOHOL AND I'M STILL STRUGGLING WITH THAT BECAUSE I WANT TO SUPPORT OUR BUSINESSES- AS YOU ORDER A MEAL YOU ORDER YOUR MEAL WITH A WITH A COCKTAIL. BUT THE REMOVAL OF THE MEAL IS WHAT I'M STRUGGLING WITH AND BECAUSE YOU KNOW AS A FORMER COUNCIL MEMBER I DO RECOGNIZE THAT. WE MAY BE DISADVANTAGING SOME OF OUR LOCAL STORES BECAUSE INSTEAD OF GOING OUT TO BUY IN OUR LOCAL STORES YOU JUST ORDER FROM A RESTAURANT SO AGAIN I'M STILL STRUGGLING A LITTLE BIT WITH THAT I WANT TO GIVE THE TERM AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO. TO MOVE THIS BILL FORWARD AND CONTINUE TO DISCUSS SAID SO I JUST WANTED TO SHARE MY CONCERNS AND ALL BUT I KNOW YOU'VE WORKED HARD ON THIS UNFORTUNATELY AMENDMENT SOMEONE MADE TO TAKE NOW REMOVES THAT THE FOOD PART OF IT AND SO I WANTED TO SEE WE CAN EXPLORE THAT FURTHER. BUT I WILL. VOTE FOR TODAY AND HOPE. THAT WE CAN CONTINUE THE DISCUSSION THANK YOU. DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER MEMBER. OF THE G. COMMITTEE. WISHING COMMENT. YES CENTER PORTENT TINA YES SIR I JUST WANT TO- ECHO CONCERNS ABOUT MAKING SURE WE HAVE SAFEGUARDS AROUND USED CAR I DON'T KNOW IF WE TALK ABOUT COLLEGE CAMPUSES ARE WE GONNA ALLOW DELIVERY TO COLLEGE CAMPUSES AND OTHER SITUATIONS WHERE YOU KNOW THERE MIGHT BE OTHER ISSUE SO- I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH SAID THE AUTHOR TO ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE ISSUES- IF THE BILL GETS OUT TODAY. IN THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE WHICH I ASSUME IT'S WHERE IT'S GONNA GO NEXT AND- YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY TRY TO ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS- YOU KNOW I HEAR THE LABOR CONCERNS AND I HEAR THE CHAIR YOU KNOW MENTIONING THAT YOU KNOW SOME OF IT IS NOT TO JERMAINE AND SO WE'LL HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS AS THIS BOOK. CONTINUES TO MOVE. THANK YOU SENATOR FORTINO ANY OTHER MEMBERS HERE WE HAVE ANOTHER ONE YET JUST TO ECHO SOME OF THE- POINTS MADE FOR SPOKE TO DO YOU APPRECIATE THIS PAIR THIS BILL TO HELP OUR RESTAURANTS HAVE STRUGGLED SO MUCH DURING COVE IT I DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE FOOD ISSUE RAISED BY MY COLLEAGUE AS WELL AS- MAKING SURE PROTECTIONS AROUND COLLEGE CAMPUSES AND OTHER. KINDS OF DELIVERIES AND BEGIN SENSITIVE TO CONCERNS OF OUR- THAT WERE RAISED BY OUR FRIENDS IN LABOR AND I DON'T THINK GENERALLY PEOPLE WOULD WANNA PAY RESTAURANT MARKET JUST TO AVOID. A MAN YOU KNOW HAVING TO GO TO A STORE BUT WHEN YOU MOVE THE FOOD. ASPECT IT DOES CONCERN ME A BIT SO AGAIN I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL BEFORE TO THINK IT'S VERY GOOD IN SPIRIT. AND LOOK FOR TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR. YES ONE I'M CERTAINLY HAPPY TO GIVE THE AUTHOR CHAIR- THE COURTESY OF CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS I GOT A CHANCE TO- PRETTY BIG WINDOW INTO THE SOME OF THE COMPLEXITIES HERE- WHEN WE WERE WORKING ON A BILL THAT'S NOW OVER ON THE ASSEMBLY SIDE- BUT I CERTAINLY- HOPE THAT- THAT THESE LABOR ISSUES AND- AND MINOR ISSUES YOUTH ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED WILL BE WILL BE WORKED OUT THROUGH THE COURSE OF THIS NEGOTIATION BUT I UNDERSTAND. AND YOU GOT A LOT OF FOLKS WHO ARE POSITIONING AND I KNOW YOU'RE GONNA BE WORKING HARD TO TRY TO COME UP WITH A NEGATIVE A SOLUTION HERE MISTER CHAIR. DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER MEMBERS HERE WISHING TO QUESTION COMMENT. SENATOR ARCHULETA YEAH I MISSED YOUR- I'M I'M REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE LABOR ISSUES AND UNTIL THEY GET RESOLVED I'M GONNA HAVE TO LAY OFF. THANK YOU. YES THEN- WELL.

I STILL BELIEVE THAT THE THINGS THAT THEY'RE BRINGING UP ARE PRETTY FAR FETCHED BUT- NEVERTHELESS WILL CONTINUE WORKING ON THAT TO SENATOR PORTMAN TINO'S POINT ABOUT COLLEGE CAMPUSES THIS BILL DOESN'T IT RIGHT NOW AS WE'VE POINTED OUT ALCOHOL CAN BE DELIVERED RIGHT NOW. THE COLLEGE CAMPUSES THIS BILL DOESN'T DO ANYTHING TO CHANGE THAT BUT I'M HAPPY- I YOU KNOW THOSE SOMEBODY THAT HAS. A LOT OF KIDS GRANDKIDS AND EVERYTHING I THINK THAT- YOU KNOW THAT'S SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE WORKED ON SO I WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH SENATOR PORTENT TINO- THAT THE- AS FAR AS THE FOOD ISSUE- THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT WE HEARD FROM THE RESTAURANT BUSINESS AND FRANKLY THE BAR BUSINESS AS WELL THE BARS WANTED YOU OUT TO HAVE THIS PRIVILEGED TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE THEIR BUSINESSES. AND THEY DON'T HAVE THE FOOD THAT THE RESTAURANT STAFF AND THEN WE'VE ALSO HAD COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE OUT AND OUT EXPENSE OF YES SOMETIMES OR IN THE FOOD ADD GIVING CONSUMERS THE ABILITY TO CHOOSE WHAT FOOD THEY WHAT THEY MIGHT WANT TO GO COCKTAILS FROM THIS RESTAURANT AND GET TO GO FOOD FROM ANOTHER ONE THIS BILL JUST DOESN'T REQUIRE YOU DOES IT.

BOATS CENTER DIED AND WE HAVE A MOTION. BY SENATOR WELL. ACTIVE PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THIS IS FOLLOWING HIM ONE S. B. A. FORTY SIX MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS DOT. DOT HI NELSON HIGH NELSON HI ALAN. ALLEN HI ARCHULETA BECKER BAKER HI GORGEOUS BRADFORD GLAZER WESO LONGER MELENDEZ MELENDEZ I POURED INTO NOW. ACCORDING TO KNOW I. RUBIO WILL I WILL I WILL CRY ON CULTURE MEN. WILL MOVE THE CALL MISTER CHAIRMAN I RETURNED TO THE CHAIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR NELSON. WE'LL NOW MOVE ON TO FILE ITEM NUMBER FOUR S. C. R. FIVE BY SENATOR MELINDA'S. CENTER MELINDA'S YOU MAY PRESENT AT C. R. FIVE GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN- MEMBERS THIS RESOLUTION DECLARES THAT THE STATE OF EMERGENCY RELATING TO THE CABIN NINETEEN PANDEMIC PROCLAIMED BY THE GOVERNOR ON MARCH FOURTH OF TWENTY TWENTY IS AT AN END THEREBY TERMINATING THE EMERGENCY POWERS GRANTED TO THE GOVERNOR PURSUANT TO THE EMERGENCY SERVICES ACT. CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN UNDER A STATE OF EMERGENCY FOR MORE THAN SEVEN HUNDRED DAYS DURING THAT TIME LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE BEEN RESPONDING IN MITIGATING THE SPREAD OF CODED BASED UPON THEIR LOCAL KNOWLEDGE IN INFECTION RATES. AS INFECTION AND HOSPITALIZATION RATES CONTINUE TO DROP IT'S TIME FOR THE STATE TO ALLOW LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO TAKE THE LEAD AND ADDRESS EMERGENCIES LOCALLY WITHOUT THE SHOT GUN APPROACH OF A STATEWIDE EMERGENCY IT IS TIME THAT WE AS A LEGISLATURE. HEED THE ADVICE GIVEN TO US BY THE LA GO TO JEALOUSLY GUARD ITS CONSTITUTIONAL ROLE IN AUTHORITY FOR NOW IT IS IN A TRULY IN A BETTER PLACE TO HANDLE FUTURE EVENTS LIKE COATED. THEN IT SHOULD ALLOW EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE TO BE DETERMINED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL JUST LIKE WE DO FOR EVERY OTHER EMERGENCY. GOVERNMENT CODE SECTION EIGHTY SIX TWENTY NINE PROVIDES THAT ALL OF THE POWERS GRANTED THE GOVERNOR BY THIS CHAPTER WITH RESPECT TO A STATE OF EMERGENCY. SHOP TERMINATE WHEN THE STATE OF EMERGENCY HAS BEEN TERMINATED BY PROCLAMATION OF THE GOVERNOR. OR BY CONCURRENT RESOLUTION AT THE LEGISLATURE DECLARING IT AT AN END THIS RESOLUTION MAKES THAT DECLARATION WITH REGARD TO THE CABIN NINETEEN PANDEMIC EMERGENCY. THE GOVERNOR HAS COME CLOSE OR POSSIBLY HAS VIOLATED THE CONSTITUTIONAL SEPARATION OF POWERS DOCTRINE BY LEGISLATING THROUGH EXECUTIVE ORDER. IN FACT THE CONSTITUTIONAL DOCTRINE OF SEPARATION OF POWERS BETWEEN THE THREE BRANCHES EXECUTIVE LEGISLATIVE AND JUDICIAL IN THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION IS QUITE CLEAR AND ECLIPSES THE EMERGENCY SERVICES ACT. EVEN IN TIMES OF EMERGENCIES STRICT SEPARATION OF POWERS EXIST BETWEEN THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH AND EXECUTIVE BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT. LEGISLATING IS THE PLENARY POWER OF THE LEGISLATURE WHETHER IN TIMES OF EMERGENCY OR NOT ONE BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT CANNOT TAKE ON A PRINCIPAL ROLE OF ANOTHER BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT A DOCTOR IN WHICH BY THE WAY IS REINFORCED BY THE SUPREME COURT. EVEN THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE HAS RECOGNIZED THIS FACT AGAIN THEIR QUOTE WAS WE URGE THE LEGISLATURE TO JEALOUSLY GUARD ITS CONSTITUTIONAL ROLE AND AUTHORITY. SAID THIS RESOLUTION SCR FIVE IS THE MANIFESTATION OF THE LEGISLATURE REASSERTING ITS PLENARY TO LEGISLATE AS WELL AS ITS CONSTITUTIONAL ROLE AND AUTHORITY. CONTINUED LOCKDOWNS IN THE DESTRUCTION OF SMALL BUSINESSES IS IT NOT THE ANSWER TO SOLVING THE SPREAD OF CODE NINETEEN. THE ARBITRARY NATURE OF WHO IS CONSIDERED ESSENTIAL AND WHAT BUSINESSES ARE ALLOWED TO REMAIN OPEN NEEDS TO END THERE ARE TOO MANY PEOPLE SUFFERING ECONOMICALLY PHYSICALLY AND MENTALLY TO INCLUDE OUR CHILDREN AS A RESULT OF THE GOVERNOR'S ACTIONS IT IS TIME. FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO RE ASSERT ITS CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY AS A LEGISLATIVE BODY OF THIS STATE AND END THIS ANALYSTS EMERGENCY- ONE FINAL NOTE IS THAT THE CODE NINETEEN CRISIS HAS RESULTED IN THE MOST EXTREME ACTIVATION OF THE EMERGENCY SERVICES ACT SINCE WORLD WAR TWO IF NOT EVER THE EMERGENCY SERVICES ACT HAS NOT BEEN INVOKED ON SUCH A WIDE SCALE IN MODERN TIMES IT WAS WRITTEN TO ADDRESS SPECIFIC TYPES OF EMERGENCIES LIKE FIRES EARTHQUAKES WAR TERRORISM THINGS OF THAT NATURE IS IN FACT IN MANYWAYS THE EMERGENCY SERVICES ACT IS OBSOLETE IT WAS WRITTEN. TO ADDRESS A POTENTIAL NUCLEAR WAR DISASTER WHERE THE GOVERNMENT AND MOST OF THE BUREAUCRATIC MACHINATIONS OF THIS STATE WERE DESTROYED OR DEAD THE CODE NINETEEN CRISIS IS NO SUCH DISASTER THE GOVERNING BODIES OF THIS STATE ARE FULLY FUNCTIONAL. THE ONGOING KEVIN NINETEEN EMERGENCIES A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT TYPE OF EMERGENCY THAN WAS ENVISIONED. WHEN EMERGENCY SERVICES ACT WAS CONCEIVED THIS RESOLUTION PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO REASSERT ITS CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY TO LEGISLATE UNDER THE SEPARATION OF POWERS DOCTRINE AND ALLOW MEMBERS TO EXPRESS THEIR CONCERNS WITH THE WAY THE ONGOING INDICATIONS OF THE EMERGENCY SERVICES ACTIVE MISSIONS. THE LEGISLATOR PROVOCATIVE THIS IS A GOOD GOVERNMENT PROPOSAL CENTERS. TODAY I HAVE BUT ONE WITNESS LAURA POWELL FROM THE CALIFORNIANS FOR GOOD GOVERNANCE FOR GOOD GOVERNANCE EXCUSE ME I ASK THAT MEMBERS PLEASE PLEASE GIVE HER YOUR RESPECTFUL ATTENTION THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MORNING PORTER I'M LAURA POWELL REPRESENTING CALIFORNIANS FOR GOOD GOVERNANCE A COALITION OF VOTERS WHO WERE CONCERNED ABOUT HOW THIS PROLONGED STATE OF EMERGENCY IS ERODING DEMOCRATIC NORMS IN OUR STATE. ALTHOUGH WE ARE NON PARTISAN. MANY OF US ARE LONG TIME DEMOCRATS WHO NOW CALL OURSELVES POLITICALLY HOMELESS BECAUSE WE NO LONGER SEE OUR PARTY STANDING UP FOR SOME OF OUR CORE VALUES. I PERSONALLY HAVE BEEN A REGISTERED DEMOCRAT FOR THIRTY YEARS SENATOR DODD I HAPPEN TO LIVE IN YOUR DISTRICT REPUBLICAN BUT I WAS HAPPY TO ACCEPT SENATOR MELINDA SAYS INVITATION TO TESTIFY TODAY. THE QUESTION POSED BY THIS RESOLUTION IS NOTHING LESS THAN WHETHER OUR STATE WILL ABANDON THE SEPARATION OF POWERS BETWEEN THREE BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT THAT IS ENSHRINED IN OUR STATE CONSTITUTION. THIS IS NOT A PARTISAN ISSUE AT LEAST IT SHOULD NOT BE. TO BE CLEAR THIS RESOLUTION IS NOT A REFERENDUM ON ANY SPECIFIC PUBLIC HEALTH POLICIES ARE IN GOVERNOR NEWSOM'S LEADERSHIP. THE QUESTION POSED BY THIS RESOLUTION IS NOT WHICH POLICY SHOULD BE ENACTED BUT WHO SHOULD BE CRAFTING THOSE POLICIES. OUR STATE GOVERNMENT LIKE OUR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS DESIGNED TO USE CHECKS AND BALANCES TO GUARD AGAINST THE INHERENT DANGER OF ANY ONE PERSON GAINING TOO MUCH POWER. THE EMERGENCY SERVICES ACT ALLOWS THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH TO TEMPORARILY USURPED SOME LEGISLATIVE POWERS WHEN THE PRICES REQUIRES SWIFT ACTION. BUT IT REPRESENTS SUCH AN EXTRAORDINARY DISRUPTION TO THE BALANCE OF POWER THAT IT MUST BE LIMITED IN DURATION. THE JUDICIAL BRANCH SO FAR HAS ESSENTIALLY PUNTED THE ISSUE BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE. ACCORDING TO THE THIRD DISTRICT COURT OF APPEAL WOULD SAVE THE EMERGENCY SERVICES ACT FROM AN UNCONSTITUTIONAL VIOLATION OF THE SEPARATION OF POWERS IS THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS THE POWER UNDER SECTION EIGHTY SIX TWENTY NINE OF THE GOVERNMENT CODE. TO TERMINATE THE STATE OF EMERGENCY IF THE CUB GOVERNOR REFUSES TO. BUT IF THE LEGISLATURE IS NOT WILLING TO CONSIDER AND GOOD FAITH WHETHER THE EMERGENCY IS OVER THE NOT SAFEGUARD IS MEANINGLESS. TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE CRISIS IS A POWER GRAB GRAB FOR THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH IS FAR FROM NORMAL. THIS IS GONE ON THROUGHOUT HISTORY AROUND THE WORLD AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY AS STATE LEGISLATURES AND COURTS HAVE HAD TO REIGN IN THE ABUSE OF EMERGENCY POWER. BY GOVERNORS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. AS PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN A RELATIVELY STABLE SOCIETY WE OFTEN TAKE OUR DEMOCRACY FOR GRANTED. BUT DEMOCRACY IS FRAGILE. IF WE NORMALIZE SUSPENDING OUR USUAL LAW MAKING PROCESS FOR A LONG LONG PERIOD OF TIME WE CHIP AWAY AT THE FOUNDATION OF OUR CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY AND HEAD DOWN A DANGEROUS PATH. EACH OF YOU HAS TAKEN A SOLEMN OATH TO DEFEND THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION. THE DUTY OF YOUR OFFICE COMPELS YOU TO RECLAIM THE POWERS THAT THE CONSTITUTION GRANTS ONLY TO THE LEGISLATURE.

MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK TODAY IN OPPOSITION TO S. C. R. FIVE MY NAME'S BRIAN RCE AND THE PRESIDENT OF CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS. I DID A THIRTYYEAR CAREER RIGHT HERE IN SACRAMENTO I REPRESENT OVER THIRTY THOUSAND CAREER FIREFIGHTER PARAMEDICS EMERGENCY SERVICE PERSONNEL. THE LAST TWO YEARS COVERT NINETEEN IF TESTED THE FIRE SERVICE IN WAYS THAT NONE OF US EXPECTED BUT THE MEN AND WOMEN SERVING THEIR COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE HAVE STEPPED UP TO THE TASK AT EVERY OPPORTUNITY. WHEN% PROVIDING EMERGENCY CARE DURING THE FIRST WAVE OF THE PANDEMIC IN THE FOLLOWING SURGES STANDING UP TESTING CLINICS AND HIGHLY IMPACTED COMMUNITIES OR CREATING MOBILE VACCINATION OR TESTING EFFORTS TO REACH THE MOST VULNERABLE CALIFORNIANS FIREFIGHTERS HAVE DONE WHATEVER. WAS NECESSARY TO KEEP THE RESIDENTS OF CALIFORNIA SAFE AND HEALTHY. ALL THOSE EFFORTS AND MORE WERE POSSIBLE DUE TO THE FLEXIBILITY TOWARD LOCAL EMS SYSTEMS LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND MORE BY THE STATE OF EMERGENCY. AND THE EXECUTIVE ORDERS IMPLEMENTED BY THE STATE. JUST AS A PANDEMIC IS ON GOING IT'S AN UNPRECEDENTED EMERGENCY FOR OUR STATE IN THE WORLD. THE RESPONSE. TO REQUIRED UNPRECEDENTED ACTION TAKE SWIFT. AND DECISIVE ACTION TO SAVE LIVES EVEN. EVEN AS A KEY EVEN AS CASE MORALITY NUMBERS CONTINUE IMPROVE THE RECENT ON THE CRIME SURGE AND ITS IMPACTS ON THE EMS SYSTEM HAVE SHOWN HOW CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THESE AUTHORITIES AND FLEXIBILITY STILL REMAIN. AMBULANCES WITH COVERT NINETEEN PATIENTS ALONG WITH THOSE EXPERIENCING OTHER HEALTH EMERGENCIES ARE WAITING FOR HOURS AND HOURS IN EMERGENCY ROOMS ON THE HALL WHAT WE CALL WALL TIME. BEEN PART OF THIS IS DUE TO THE INFLUX OF PATIENTS WITH COPD NINETEEN. I'M GONNA WRAP IT UP AND IT'S GOING TO SAY. THIS IS NOT THE TIME FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO GET INVOLVED IN EMERGENCY AS IT IS WINDING DOWN THIS IS A VIRUS. THAT MUTATES AND CHANGES ARE EMERGENCY SERVICES SYSTEM IS STILL VERY IMPACTED AND THE FLEXIBILITY THAT WE GET OFF OF THE EXECUTIVE ORDERS NOT ONLY IS APPROPRIATE BUT NEEDS TO REMAIN IN PLACE.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH MODERATOR- THANKS TO ALL OUR SUPPORT OPPOSITION WITNESSES WILL BRING DISCUSSION BACK TO THE MEMBERS- DO ANY OF OUR MEMBERS HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. SENATOR NELSON. THIS PRESIDENT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF THE COMMITTEE THIS IS ONE OF MOST IMPORTANT BILLS BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE NOT THIS YEAR BUT MANY YEARS. WHY I'VE COMPLAINED OFTEN HEAR ABOUT HOW THE EXECUTIVE BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT STATE AND FEDERAL. INCLUDING PRESIDENTS AND GOVERNORS HAVE USURPED THROUGH EMERGENCY ORDER AND GOVERNMENT THROUGH EMERGENCY DECLARATIONS. I REMEMBER VOTING FOR THE BILL. IN READING THE BILL AS I OFTEN DO. AND IT CONCERNS ME. OF NO PROVISIONS I FELT OR TOO VAGUE OF PROVISIONS ABOUT HOW THAT THOSE ORDERS WOULD BE EXTINGUISHED. WELL GOVERNORS AND PRESIDENTS HAVE FIGURED OUT HOW TO DEAL WITH THAT. THEY NOW HAVE A LOT MORE POWER. YEAH WHOSE POWER IS IT. NOT OURS THE LEGISLATURE. ALREADY THE GOVERNORS OF THE PRESIDENT'S THE POWER OF THE CITIZENS. IT IS TIME TO STOP FEEDING THAT AUTHORITY TO THE AGENCIES ARE STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THE GOVERNORS AND PRESIDENTS THIS IS URGENT WE REPRESENT ABOUT A MILLION PEOPLE EACH OF US. WE ARE THEIR VOICES HERE. ARE WE GOING TO ALLOW THEIR VOICES. TO BE SILENCED I ARGUE IN FAVOR OF THIS BILL THANK YOU SENATOR NELSON. ANY OTHER MEMBERSWISHING CENTER ALAN. WELL MEMBER SITE I THINK THERE'S SO MUCH THAT'S COMPELLING ABOUT THIS BILL AND I UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE WOULD BE INCLINED TO SUPPORT IT I THINK THAT THE ONE PROBLEM HERE IS THAT DECLARING THE EMERGENCY OVER- WOULD HINDER OUR ABILITY TO DO A LOT THAT INVOLVES. FIGHTING THIS PANDEMIC I HAVE A THERE'S A BIG PIECE IN THE LA TIMES YESTERDAY ABOUT ABOUT THIS ISSUE AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL AND SO MANY OF THESE ISSUES ARE AT PLAY HERE IN OUR STATE LEVEL AS WELL IT WOULD MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR US TO PROVIDE FREE. I. THERAPEUTICS FOR EXAMPLE IN TESTING AND- ALL THE ISSUES THAT WERE RAISED BY A NUMBER OF THE FOLKS WHO TESTIFIED EARLIER TODAY SO I JUST I. I COULD SEE MYSELF SUPPORTING A SIGNIFICANTLY LIMITED VERSION THIS BILL BUT CERTAINLY NOT IN THE FORM. THAT AS IT'S BEEN PRESENTED TODAY AND I I'M NOT GONNA BE SUPPORTIVE TODAY. THANK YOU SENATOR ALAN. ANYBODY ELSE WISHING TO ADDRESS COMMITTEE. I WAS AT YOU OVER THERE SENATOR WELCOME PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU MSTER CHAIR FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD AND IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME COMING AND I KNOW THAT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU I THINK YOU'RE GREAT CHAIRMAN YOU RESPECT BOTH THE MAJORITY AND THE MINORITY MEMBERS EQUALLY AND SO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD I DO HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS- FOR THE AUTHOR SHE'S WILLING TO TAKE THEM. AND SINCE IT'S NOT THE FLOOR. I'M GOING TO ASK YOU- SO FIRST- FIRST QUESTION I HAVE IF S. C. R. FIVE WERE WERE TO PASS TODAY WELL ANYTHING THIS BILL PREVENTS THE GOVERNMENT FROM TAKING RAPID ACTION IN THE FUTURE SHOULD THE STATE EXPERIENCED A SURGE IN KOBE NINETEEN CASES HOSPITALIZATIONS OR DEATHS. I THROUGH THE CHAIR THANK YOU SENATOR WORK FOR YOUR QUESTION AND THE ANSWER TO THAT IS NO THERE IS NOTHING THAT WOULD STOP- THIS BODY OR THE GOVERNOR FROM TAKING ACTION TO MAKE SURE THAT ANY COULD SURGE THAT MIGHT COME AT US IN THE FUTURE WOULD NOT BE ADEQUATELY AND APPROPRIATELY ADDRESSED WE STILL MAINTAIN THAT AUTHORITY GREAT HAVE A FOLLOW UP QUESTION IS THERE ANYTHING IN S. ZERO FIVE THAT WOULD RESULT IN CALIFORNIA BECOMING IN- TO RECEIVE EMERGENCY THOUGHT. FINDING THANK YOU SENATOR WOKE TO THE CHAIR NOW THERE IS I KNOW THAT THE OPPOSITION IS TRYING TO PRESENT THIS AS THOUGH WE WILL LOSE OUT ON- ALL THE FUNDING IN THE RESOURCES THAT WE MIGHT NEED IN THE FUTURE IF. ANOTHER SURGE TAKES PLACE BUT THAT IS SIMPLY NOT THE CASE AND I THINK THAT'S FEAR MONGERING TACTICS THAT APPARENTLY HAVE WORKED- QUITE WELL BUT THAT IS NOT THE CASE. THANK YOU STORE SO ON MY OWN TIME. REALLY ENJOYED THE DEBATE TODAY BECAUSE IF TODAY WAS FASTER THIS I COULD I COULD LIST THE GOVERNOR'S MISSTEPS HIS OVER REACH ANY SECRET DEALS IN LIKE A CATALOG THEM ALL FOR YOU BUT IT'S NOT TESTED THIS I'M NOT GONNA DO THAT. SO TO ME THIS IS ALL ABOUT RESTORING THE CONSTITUTIONAL BALANCE. BETWEEN THE THREE BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT. AND TO SAY THAT WE THINK WE CAN'T DO THAT WE JUST DID THAT YESTERDAY IF YOU ALL RECALL WE DIDN'T LIKE A COURT CASE AND WE PASSED SB ONE EIGHTEEN. WENT TO HOUSE THE SAME DAY GOVERNOR SIGNED IT THE SAME DAY. SO ALL WE'RE LOOKING FOR IS TO GIVE THE PEOPLE'S VOICE BACK ONE MAN RULE I THINK IT'S BEEN DETRIMENTAL TO OUR SOCIETY. AND IT'S GOING TO HAVE A CLOSE THE FACT I THINK LONG TERM ON GOVERNMENT. AND YOU KNOW AS WE PULL AWAY FROM THIS CREDIT FROM THIS CRISIS. I HOPE WE CAN. LOOK BACK WITH LESS PASSION AND LOOK TO SEE WHAT WE DID RIGHT AND WHAT WE DID WRONG SO WE DON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKES AGAIN I MEAN I THINK TOO OFTEN. THE GOVERNMENT THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS. WE JUST KIND OF YOU KNOW. YOU LIKE CANCERS IN A WILL YOU KNOW A CYCLING AROUND AND I THINK YOU KNOW THE WORLD'S GETTING SMALLER THROUGH GLOBALIZATION. I'M ASSUMING WE'RE GONNA HAVE MORE PANDEMICS NOT LAST IN WE DIDN'T GET IT RIGHT THIS TIME. AND SO WE HAVE A CHANCE AT LEAST GET BACK ON. ON THAT ROAD BUT I THINK THE MORE IMPORTANT THING IS THAT. WE NEED TO FIX THE THINGS SAID THAT WENT WRONG THIS TIME BECAUSE A LOT PEOPLE PAID DEARLY. WITH THEIR LIVES WITH THEIR LOSS OF BUSINESSES WITH THE WITH MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES SO AGAIN. THIS RESTORE THE CONSTITUTIONAL BALANCE THAT THE FRAMERS DESIGNED AND THAT HAS WORKED WELL FOR SO MANY YEARS THANK YOU THANK YOU CENTER WILL THAT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THIS BE ENDED AT SOME POINT I GUESS THAT I LET I WOULD LIKE TO ASK. THE CHAIR MEET MAYBE IF ONE OF THE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OR THE OR THE COMMITTEE STAFF COULD. COULD RESPOND TO THE ANSWERS THAT WERE GIVEN BY OUR COLLEAGUE ABOUT FEDERAL FUNDING IN ABOUT- ABOUT ABOUT POWER SAID THIS WOULD THIS WOULD ROLL BACK IN TERMS OF OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO RESPOND TO THE PANDEMIC I WOULD LOVE TO GET SOME SOME FURTHER CLARIFICATION INFORMATION FROM- FROM FROM EXPERTS ON THIS IS SO WE CAN. AS YOU'RE EITHER ONE OF THE PRESENTERS OR BOTH. PLEASE. WHAT DOES. OKAY SIR YEAH. OKAY I BELIEVE THE QUESTION HERE WAS WHETHER THESE- THESE WOULD EITHER BE CONTINUED OR OR DEFINITIVELY ENDED THE- FEDERAL FUNDING THE WAIVERS WE DISCUSSED WITHOUT THE QUESTION SURE. CENTER ALEXANDER ANSWERED SHE I WOULD LIKE SOME CLARITY ON ON FINDING AND I ALSO WOULD LIKE SOME CLARITY ON THE EXTENT TO WHICH THIS WOULD WOULD HINDER OUR ABILITY TO ACT QUICKLY. HOW TO RESPOND TO CHANGES IN THE IN THE IN THE- IN COVE IT AS IF THERE'S ANOTHER SURGE OF CENTRAL DON'T MIND WILL BOTH ANSWER ALL TALK ABOUT THE HOSPITAL WAIVERS AND THEN MAYBE- BRIAN YOU CAN TALK ABOUT THE FIELD- FOR THE HOSPITAL WAIVERS IT WOULD AND SOME OF OUR FUNDING- BECAUSE WE DO GET FUNDING THROUGH FEMA. IT WOULD ALSO MORE IMPORTANTLY AND THE WAIVERS I DISCUSS RELATED TO BOTH OUT OF STATE. LICENSURE THAT WOULD HAVE TO RUN. THAT STRUCTURE CHANGES TO RUN THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE IN RECORD TIME- THE SENATOR- DID MENTION THAT THOSE THINGS HAVE BEEN DONE BUT UNFORTUNATELY GIVEN THE MASS AMOUNT WOULD HAVE TO BE DONE- THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY TO DO THAT IS THROUGH. A PUBLIC- EXECUTIVE ORDER- SO BOTH THE HOSPITAL OUT OF STATE WAIVER AS WELL AS THE SPACE WAIVER DETER CRITICAL TO AGAIN. THE WALL TIME ISSUES OF SEPARATING PATIENTS PARTICULAR IMMUNO COMPROMISED PATIENTS I AM IN ADDITION WHAT I DIDN'T GET TO MENTION IS WE ARE. SEEING A LOT OF PATIENTS COME IN SICKER BECAUSE THEY DELAYED CARE. SO WHILE THE NUMBERS MIGHT BE GOING DOWN OUR HOSPITALS AND EMS SYSTEMS ARE. HIGHLY IMPACTED BECAUSE PATIENTS WAITED- LONGER TO GET THEIR CARE AND ARE COMING IN STICKER- SO THERE'S STILL THE PUBLIC EMERGENCY- EXECUTIVE ORDERS ALLOW THE GOVERNMENT TO RECOGNIZE THIS AND- AND PULL BACK INTO THE CONVERSATION. AS WELL- MY COLLEAGUE. MISTER CHAIR FOR THE FOR SERVICE ONE OF THE- BIGGEST CONCERNS THAT WE WOULD HAVE WOULD BE SOME OF THE- RULES IN THE ADAPTATION OF RULES THAT ALLOW US TO DO CERTAIN PROCEDURES IN THE FIELD- THAT. POTENTIALLY COULD GO AWAY AT A TIME WHEN WE'RE STILL HIGHLY IMPACTED- BY THE VIRUS. AND THE PATIENTS THAT NEED OUR HELP THE OTHER ONE IS- OUR ABILITY TO ASSIGN FIELD PERSONNEL INTO EMERGENCY ROOMS TO CONSOLIDATE PATIENTS SOME OF THESE THINGS. WE'RE NOT READY YET. AND WE'RE NOT READY ON THE USER END AND MY BIGGEST CONCERN WOULD BE FOR CALIFORNIANS ARE WE ABLE TO GIVE THE TYPE OF CARE THAT WE NEED TO TAKE IT AWAY IT DOESN'T. MATTER HOW FAST YOU CAN BRING IT BACK IF YOU'RE TAKING IT AWAY WHEN IT STILL NEEDED THAT'S THAT'S NOT GOOD THAT'S NOT GOOD POLICY WE'RE NOT THERE YET WE'RE CLOSE BUT WE'RE NOT THERE YET. THANK YOU COULD I COULD WITH IT CAN I ASK THAT THE WITNESSES STAND B POLICE WITNESSES. I DO YOU HAVE THIS MEASURE- WHAT HOW LONG DO YOU THINK WE OUGHT. HOW LONG DO YOU THINK WE OUGHT TO BE THINKING ABOUT- THE DURATION OF THIS THE STATE OF EMERGENCY DECLARATION- IF WE DO TURN THIS DOWN TODAY WHAT STEPS SHOULD WE TAKE. HI THAT WAS THAT SHE WOULD BE TAKING TO MOVE RAPIDLY TOWARD AN EVENTUAL RECISION OF THE STATE AMER'S DIRECT REGULAR. DECLARATION BRAIN RES FOR THE CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS I'M ON A WEEKLY MONTHLY CALLS WITH HIGH LEVEL OFFICIALS IN THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH- WITH THE HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION. AND TRYING TO GAME THIS OUT INTO THE FUTURE. AND I DON'T THINK ANY OF US YOU'RE QUALIFIED TO SEE WHEN THEY SHOULD AND I THINK THAT. THE GOVERNOR IN A DOCTOR GALLEY THEY HAVE A TEAM IN PLACE OF MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS MEDICAL SCIENTISTS AND A DELIVERY SYSTEM- ACROSS CALIFORNIA. THAT ONE WE NEED TO FOLLOW THEM AND WHEN THEY SAY NOW IS THE TIME I THINK WE CAN REST ASSURED AND BE READY THAT IT'S YOUR PREPARATORY TO. REMOVE THE ADVERT- THE- THE EXECUTIVE ORDER I THINK WE NEED TO RELY ON THE LEADERS THAT HAVE LETTUCE SO FAR. THANK YOU ANY OTHER COMMENTS MANY MEMBER CENTER MONDAYS BEFORE YOU CLOSE I WANTED TO OFFER A COUPLE OF THE COMMENTS FIRST OF ALL WE'VE HEARD HERE ABOUT- ABOUT THE DIALOGUE ABOUT THE DEBATE TODAY AND I APPRECIATE THAT- THE GOOD STRONG DEBATE ON BOTH SIDES WHAT WE CAN HAVE THIS- A DISAGREEMENT ABOUT. YOU KNOW REALLY WHAT'S GOING ON FOR WELL YOU KNOW I HEAR THE GOVERNOR DIDN'T GET IT RIGHT YEAH FRANKLY WHEN I LOOK AT THIS AND I LOOK TO GO BACK AND LOOK AT TWO YEARS OF THE PANDEMIC I FOR ONE WE HAD NO PLAYBOOK. NOBODY HAD A PLAYBOOK ON THIS THING I THINK THE GOVERNOR GOT RIGHT I THINK HE CONTINUES TO GET IT RIGHT. AND LOOK AT IT'S NOT THAT THERE'S NO MISTAKES BEING MADE WERE ALL HUMAN BEINGS WITH NO PLAYBOOK BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND HOW STRONG THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN OUR NUMBERS. ARE COMPARED TO OTHER STATES THAT- WEREN'T DOING SOME OF THE SAME THINGS- I FOR ONE AM PROUD. OF THIS GOVERNOR FOR DOING WHAT HE DID WE ALL KNOW THE IMPACT THE COVERT NINETEEN HAS HAD ON OUR DAILY LIVES. AND I'M HAPPY TO SEE CASERATES AND HOSPITALIZATION THAT LOW NUMBERS- AND WE RETURN TO NORMALIZATION OF LIFE. HOWEVER THE EXISTING STATE OF EMERGENCY PROCLAIMED BY THE GOVERNOR IS ABSOLUTELY IMPORTANT TO ENSURE THAT THE STATE CAN QUICKLY AND EFFICIENTLY CONTINUE TO RESPOND TO THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC IT BE PREPARED FOR POSSIBLE FUTURE VARIANTS AND SURGEONS. TODAY THERE ARE SIXTY THREE PROVISIONS RELATING TO COPE AT NINETEEN STATE OF EMERGENCY. EIGHTEEN OF THOSE ARE SCHEDULED TO BE TERMINATED AT THE END OF THIS MONTH IN ANOTHER FIFTEEN AT THE END OF JUNE LEAVING OPEN THIRTY PROVISIONS IMPORTANT. FOR MAINTAINING GOVERNMENT FLEXIBILITY. I LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT IN ADDITION TO THE ONGOING STATE OF EMERGENCY. THEY'RE CURRENTLY ALMOST FIFTY OPEN STATE OF EMERGENCIES REGARDING SIT VARIOUS SITUATIONS INCLUDING WILDFIRES DROUGHT. TREE MORTALITY AND THE ORVILLE DAM SPILLWAY EMERGENCY. THESE STATES OF EMERGENCY PROVIDE THE STATE WITH THE ABILITY TO MOST EFFECTIVELY CARRY OUT CLEAN UP RECOVERY AND MITIGATION OF LASTING. NEGATIVE IMPACTS FURTHER OF THE LEGISLATURE'S PREVIOUSLY CONFERRED AUTHORITY TO THE STATE LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH AGENCIES TO ISSUE ORDERS. IN RESPOND TO AND CONTROL THE SPREAD OF TRANSMISSIBLE DISEASE. THIS INCLUDES ORDERS FROM THE- DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH IMPOSING MASKING REQUIREMENTS AND TESTING AND VACCINATION REQUIREMENTS FOR CERTAIN SETTINGS. THUS IF THIS RESOLUTION WERE TO BE ADOPTED WOULD HAVE NO IMPACT ON THE STATE LOCAL MASKING REQUIREMENTS OR OTHER PUBLIC HEALTH ORDERS. FOR THOSE REASONS FOR NUMBER REASONS POINTED OUT BY VARIOUS SPEAKERS IN THE OPPOSITION. I'LL BE VOTING NO TODAY ON S. C. R. FIVE AND LAST MY MEMBERS TO DO THE SAME. WITH THAT SAID SEND REMINDERS WHICH LIKE TO CLOSE. I WOULD THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU MEMBERS FOR YOUR COMMENTS AND YOUR QUESTIONS IN THE- ROBUST DEBATE I HAVE A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT I NEED TO ADDRESS IN MY CLOTHES- I. I WANT TO REMIND YOU SENATORS A THIRD TWENTY NINE OTHER STATES THAT HAVE ENDED THEIR STATE OF EMERGENCY ARE THEY ALL NOW AT RISK. IF THERE IS A CODE RED SERGE. DO YOU THINK THAT THEY HAVE NOT CONTEMPLATED WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN. IF THEY HAVE ANOTHER SURGEON THEY DON'T HAVE A STATE OF EMERGENCY IN PLACE TWENTY NINE OTHER STATES. SO THEY ARE PUTTING THEIR CONSTITUENTS AT RISK. THE THE OTHER EIGHT POINT I'D LIKE TO MAKE IS THAT YOU KNOW THERE'S SUCH A THING CALLED. A STATE OF EMERGENCY DECLARED BY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN FACT I HAD ONE RECENTLY IN MY OWN CITY WHERE WE HAD A FIRE. WE DECLARED A STATE OF EMERGENCY THEN THE STATE KICKS IN AND THEN FEMA CAN KICK IN AND REIMBURSEMENTS ARE MADE AND EVERYONE IS TAKING CARE OF. THAT'S HOW IT SHOULD BE. AND THAT IS STILL THE CASE TODAY WE DON'T HAVE A STATEWIDE SURGE OF COVERED RIGHT NOW WE MAY NOT HAVE ANOTHER STATEWIDE SURGE OF COVERAGE SO RATHER THAN. USE THIS ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH OF KEEPING THE ENTIRE STATE IN A STATE OF EMERGENCY WHY NOT LOCALIZE IT WHY NOT ALLOW LOCAL COMMUNITIES. IF THEY HAVE A SURGE IF THEY'RE EXPERIENCING DIFFICULTY WITH CAPACITY IN THEIR HOSPITALS OR OTHER SERVICES. ALLOW THEM TO DECLARE STATE OF EMERGENCY AND THEN THE STATE CAN STEP IN AND HELP IN THE FEDS CAN STEP IN AND HELP IF NECESSARY. BUT TO DO SO. YOU KNOW IT INTO ETERNITY DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE I MEAN I'M LISTENING TO THE OPPOSITION THEY WILL THEY HAVE NO IDEA WHEN. THE STATE OF EMERGENCY **** AND THEY'RE NOT QUALIFIED TO SAY SO. SO IT GOES ON FOREVER. BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THE SUGGESTION WAS TODAY THAT IT JUST GOES ON FOREVER UNTIL DOCTOR DAILY OR SOMEBODY ELSE IN PUBLIC HEALTH DECIDES THAT IT'S OVER- THERE WERE SOME OPPOSITION LETTERS SENT IN AND A FEW OF THEM HAD SOME REALLY SHOCKING- CLAIMS IN HERE THAT I WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS AND I KNOW ALL OF YOU HAVE RECEIVED. THESE OPPOSITION LETTERS. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS- CLAIMED IT WAS THAT PHARMACIES AND PHARMACY TECHS WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO ADMINISTER VACCINES AND BOOSTERS. THAT IS NONSENSE ANDI HOPE YOU RECOGNIZE THAT IF THAT WERE THE CASE HOW IS IT THAT OUR PHARMACIES AND PHARMACY TECHS HAVE BEEN ADMINISTERING FLU SHOTS. HAVEN'T BEEN MINISTERING SHINGLES VACCINATION HOW THEY'VE BEEN DOING THAT ABSENT A STATE OF EMERGENCY. WE'VE BEEN DOING THAT AS FAR AS A SHORTAGE IN CALIFORNIA I THANK THE OPPOSITION FOR RECOGNIZING THAT WE HAVE A SHORTAGE OF MEDICAL PERSONNEL IN CALIFORNIA AND THAT HAS BEEN THE CASE. FOR A DECADE NOW AT LEAST IT IS NO SECRET THAT WE HAVE A SHORTAGE OF REGISTERED NURSES IN CALIFORNIA WE BRING THE MEN ALL THE TIME IN NOTHING. AND S. E. R. FIVE WOULD PROHIBIT THOSE OUT OF STATE WORKERS FROM BEING ABLE TO CONTINUE TO COME IN AND HELP WHERE NECESSARY NOTHING IN THIS BILL. PROHIBITS THAT. ONE OF THE OTHER CLAIMS MADE ABOUT THE SPACE WAIVERS. YOU KNOW SENATOR WELCOME WHEN I THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS BECAUSE YOU MADE A POINT THAT I WAS THINKING ABOUT AS THE OPPOSITION WAS MOUNTING THEIR CLAIM THAT WE WOULD SUDDENLY LOSE THE WAIVERS FOR ALL OF THE SPACES AGAIN NONSENSE- THE LEGISLATURE COULD TOMORROW. INTRODUCED LEGISLATION TO IMPLEMENT THESE VERY WAIVERS THERE IS NOTHING STOPPING US FROM DOING THAT WE DID IT YESTERDAY AND THAT WAS JUST FOR- ENROLLMENT AT UC BERKELEY. AND BOY THE LEGISLATURE WENT LIKE LIGHTNING SPEED TO ADDRESS THAT PROBLEM THAT WASN'T EVEN AN ISSUE WHERE PEOPLE'S HEALTH WAS CONCERNED SO YOU'RE TELLING ME THE OPPOSITION WOULD HAVE US BELIEVE THAT THIS BODY IS INCAPABLE OF DOING THE SAME THING WHEN IT COMES TO PEOPLE'S HEALTH REALLY BECAUSE I TAKE OFFENSE TO THAT. AND YOU SHOULD TOO. M. THE OTHER. CLAIM THAT WAS MADE OUT OF THERE I MEAN I'VE GOT MORE LETTERS HERE THAN I KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH AND I CAN'T ADDRESS ALL OF THEM. ACTUALLY YOU KNOW WHAT I'M JUST GOING TO GO TO MY CLOTHES BECAUSE I COULD GO ON FOR HOURS REFUTING THE CLAIMS THAT WERE MADE SENATOR DODD I DON'T WANT TO DO THAT TO YOU SO I WILL GO TO MY CLOTHES BUT I WILL. TELL YOU SENATORS THAT I KNOW. THAT THE OPPOSITION HAS. MADE SOME VERY DIRE CLAIMS AND THEIR OPPOSITION LETTERS AND I AM BEGGING YOU. TO SEE THROUGH THAT. LISTEN TO YOUR CONSTITUENTS RECOGNIZE THIS FOR WHAT THIS IS THIS IS NOT A PARTISAN. BILL IT'S JUST NOT YOU THOSE OF YOU WHO WHO ARE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ALL OF THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE YOU HAVE HEARD FROM YOUR CONSTITUENTS I KNOW YOU HAVE BECAUSE I'VE SPOKEN WITH YOU. AND YOU KNOW THAT YOUR CONSTITUENTS ARE FED UP WITH THIS AS WELL AND JUST. CONSIDER FOR A MOMENT THE PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPACT THAT BEING IN A CONSTANT STATE OF EMERGENCY HAS. ON YOUR CONSTITUENTS HAS ON YOUR CHILDREN HAS ON YOUR HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS. BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GOOD KIDS IN MY DISTRICT WHO NEED MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES THEY NEED TO SEE. A PSYCHOLOGIST THEY ARE STRUGGLING MIGHTILY WITH THIS. AND YOU KNOW WHAT THEY CAN'T GET IN TO SEE. SOMEONE TO COUNSEL THEM. THEY CAN'T GO IN PERSON TO SEE SOMEONE. BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT TAKING IN PERSON PATIENTS BECAUSE OF BECAUSE OF IT. SO IF YOU REMOVE THIS BARRIER JUST FROM A PSYCHOLOGICAL STANDPOINT MY GOODNESS LOOK AT. THE HELP THAT YOU CAN BE DOING FOR SO MANY OF THESE KIDS. I'LL CONTINUE WITH MY CLOTHES. AND I'M NOT SURE WHAT'S SO FUNNY ON THIS SIDE OF THE ROOM BUT I WILL CONTINUE I FIRST WANT TO EXPRESS MY APPRECIATION FOR PRO TEM ATKINS AND THE CHAIRMAN FOR SETTING THIS RESOLUTION FOR HEARING IT IS BEEN A LONG TIME COMING- AND I THANK YOU FOR THAT YOU'VE HEARD ME SAY ON THE SENATE FLOOR IS OVER FOUR HUNDRED DAYS OLD. AND THE STATE OF EMERGENCY HAS BEEN IN PLACE FOR OVER SEVEN HUNDRED DAYS IN FACT THE STATE OF EMERGENCY HAS BEEN EXTENDED THREE TIMES SINCE IT WAS FIRST ENACTED IN MARCH OF TWENTY TWENTY. THIS RESOLUTION IS ABOUT ONE THING AND ONE THING ONLY AND THAT I THE BALANCE OF POWER. THE BALANCE BETWEEN EXECUTIVE POWER AND LEGISLATION LEGISLATIVE POWER TO BE PRECISE. MANY OF THE GROUPS AND INDIVIDUALS WHO OPPOSE THIS RESOLUTION THINK THAT THE STATE'S COVERT RESPONSE WILL COME TO A CRASHING HALT AND IT DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY. LOCAL GOVERNMENT WILL STILL HAVE THE POWER TO DECLARE A LOCAL STATE OF EMERGENCY IS TO NOTIFY THE STATE THAT THEY ARE UNABLE TO MEET A POTENTIAL SURGE. OF A LOCAL GOVERNMENT FEELS EMERGENCY ORDERS ARE NECESSARY TO TACKLE AN OUTBREAK OR TRIAGE MEDICAL RESOURCES AN EMERGENCY ORDER BY THE LOCALS ENGAGES STATE RESOURCES. THIS IS PRECISELY HOW EMERGENCY SERVICES ACT WORKS FOR WILDFIRES IN PRETTY MUCH ANY OTHER DECLARED EMERGENCY. SO WE'RE GOING TO FOLLOW THE GOVERNOR'S OWN WORDS OF LOCALISM IS DETERMINATIVE. DURING HIS SMARTER PRESS CONFERENCE. THEN LETTING LOCALS DECIDE. IS WHAT'S BEST LET'S TAKE FOR SECOND LET'S CONSIDER THE OPPOSITION IS CORRECT JUST FOR THE SAKE OF ARGUMENT AND ASSUMING THAT ALL OF THESE THINGS COME TO A CRASHING HALT HAVE WE NOT SPENT THE LAST TWO YEARS. PREPARING PREPARING THE STATE FOR THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE HAVE WE'VE DONE NOTHING IN THE PAST TWO YEARS ARE WE CAUGHT COMPLETELY FLAT FOOTED BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THE SUGGESTION IS THE GOVERNOR IN HIS STATE OF THE STATE IN HIS SMARTER PRESS CONFERENCE INSURED CALIFORNIANS THAT WE ARE READY AS YOUR FIVE DOES NOT LIMIT THE GOVERNOR'S POWER TO ISSUE EXECUTIVE ORDERS IT JUST DOESN'T. IF WE BELIEVE THE OPPOSITION'S CLAIMS THEY ARE INHERENTLY SAYING THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS IN. INCAPABLE OF DOING ITS JOB EDITING CAPABLE OF RESPONDING TO EMERGENCIES ARE GIVING COMMUNITIES THE RESOURCES THEY NEED TO ADDRESS CRITICAL SITUATIONS. AND I DON'T BELIEVE THAT AND I HOPE YOU DON'T EACH LEGISLATOR IN THE ASSEMBLY AND SENATE AGREED AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS PANDEMIC TO GRANT THE GOVERNOR WITH EMERGENCY POWERS TO ADDRESS THE CRISIS AT HAND BECAUSE IN THE FIRST DAYS OF COVERED NOBODY KNEW WHAT WE WERE DEALING WITH. HEALTH EXPERTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND ACROSS THE WORLD WERE ATTEMPTING TO DECIPHER THE GENETIC CODE OF THIS BUYERS TO DETERMINE HOW IT WORKED. WE DIDN'T HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS THE CHAIRMAN WAS RIGHT ABOUT THAT. AND MISTAKES WERE MADE AND WE LEARN FROM THOSE MISTAKES. BUT WE ENDED SCHOOL YEARS AND WE SHUTTERED BUSINESSES AND WE IMPLEMENTED LOCKDOWNS AND REINFORCED REMOTE WORK AND WE IMPLEMENTED ALL SORTS OF POLICIES IN TESTING AND NOW AFTER TWO YEARS. OF THIS.
