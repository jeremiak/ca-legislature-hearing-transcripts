01:07:40.489 --> 01:07:42.425
UNCOMFORTABLE BECAUSE THE MEMORY

01:07:42.491 --> 01:07:44.360
IS OUR BEST TOOL TO ENSURE THAT

01:07:44.427 --> 01:07:45.628
NOTHING LIKE THE HOLOCAUST EVER

01:07:45.694 --> 01:07:48.364
HAPPENS AGAIN.

01:07:48.431 --> 01:07:49.265
WE MUST ALSO REMEMBER THE

01:07:49.331 --> 01:07:50.900
HOLOCAUST BECAUSE IN TOO MANY

01:07:50.966 --> 01:07:52.301
PLACES INCLUDING IN OUR OWN

01:07:52.368 --> 01:07:55.171
COUNTRY IT IS FADING FROM MEMORY.

01:07:55.237 --> 01:07:57.440
RECENT POLLS SUGGEST THAT 50% OF

01:07:57.506 --> 01:07:59.241
AMERICANS LACK BASIC KNOWLEDGE

01:07:59.308 --> 01:08:00.743
ABOUT THE HOLOCAUST.

01:08:00.810 --> 01:08:02.344
AND 20% OF MILLENNIALS HAVE

01:08:02.411 --> 01:08:04.847
NEVER EVEN HEARD OF IT.

01:08:04.914 --> 01:08:05.981
THIS YEAR WE REMEMBER THE

01:08:06.048 --> 01:08:07.750
HOLOCAUST AGAINST THE BACKDROP

01:08:07.817 --> 01:08:09.485

SEMITIC INCIDENTS IN THE US.

01:08:11.587 --> 01:08:13.722
AND AROUND THE GLOBE.

01:08:13.789 --> 01:08:15.658
JUST TWO DAYS AGO IN OUR OWN

01:08:15.724 --> 01:08:16.959
STATE WE WITNESSED AND YET

01:08:17.026 --> 01:08:18.327
ANOTHER ACT OF VIOLENT ANTI

01:08:18.394 --> 01:08:19.862
SEMITISM.

01:08:19.929 --> 01:08:21.197
A TRAGIC SHOOTING THAT FELL ON

01:08:21.263 --> 01:08:23.332
THE SIX MONTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE

01:08:23.399 --> 01:08:24.934
KILLING OF ELEVEN WORSHIPERS AT

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:25.935

IN BETWEEN THESE DEADLY ATTACKS

01:08:29.672 --> 01:08:31.006
THE CALIFORNIA JEWISH COMMUNITY

01:08:31.073 --> 01:08:32.475
HAS ENTERED A SERIES OF ANTI

01:08:32.541 --> 01:08:33.976
SEMITIC INCIDENTS.

01:08:34.043 --> 01:08:35.644
AND BEEN ALARMED BY THE INFUSION

01:08:35.711 --> 01:08:36.979
OF ANTI SEMITISM INTO OUR

01:08:37.046 --> 01:08:39.682

01:08:39.748 --> 01:08:41.183
AS WE REFLECT ON THESE INCIDENTS

01:08:41.250 --> 01:08:42.051
IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE

01:08:42.117 --> 01:08:43.319
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE HOLOCAUST

01:08:43.385 --> 01:08:45.588
DIDN'T HAPPEN OVERNIGHT.

01:08:45.654 --> 01:08:47.089
IT DID NOT BEGIN WITH GAS

01:08:47.156 --> 01:08:49.091
CHAMBERS AND DEATH MARCHES.

01:08:49.158 --> 01:08:51.327
IT BEGAN WITH WORDS AND DEEDS OF

01:08:51.393 --> 01:08:53.596
A MUCH MORE MODEST NATURE.

01:08:53.662 --> 01:08:55.164
WITH HATEFUL RHETORIC AND

01:08:55.231 --> 01:08:56.866

DISCRIMINATORY LAWS.

01:08:58.801 --> 01:09:00.936
WITH THE DEMOCRATIC ELECTION

01:09:01.003 --> 01:09:03.272

01:09:03.339 --> 01:09:04.940

WE MUST REMIND OURSELVES OF THE

01:09:14.783 --> 01:09:16.685
TRAJECTORY OF GENOCIDE.

01:09:16.752 --> 01:09:18.287

01:22:21.503 --> 01:22:23.104
MAY BE FADING.

01:22:23.171 --> 01:22:25.040
LAST YEAR A SURVEY SHOWED THAT

01:22:25.106 --> 01:22:27.742
31% OF ALL AMERICANS AND 41% OF

01:22:27.809 --> 01:22:29.144

01:22:31.012 --> 01:22:32.981
MILLION JEWS WERE KILLED.

01:22:33.048 --> 01:22:34.449
HALF OF MILLENNIALS COULD NOT

01:22:34.516 --> 01:22:37.452
NAME A SINGLE CONCENTRATION CAMP.

01:22:37.519 --> 01:22:39.988
TODAY WE COMMIT OURSELVES TO NOT

01:22:40.055 --> 01:22:41.856

01:22:41.923 --> 01:22:44.225

WE MUST ROOT OUT HATE IN OUR

COMMUNITIES AND DO ALL WE CAN TO

01:22:52.233 --> 01:22:53.201

01:25:51.579 --> 01:25:53.047
HITLER SAW THESE INNOCENT PEOPLE

AS A THREAT TO WHAT HE BELIEVED

01:25:55.049 --> 01:25:57.252
WAS THE SUPERIOR RACE.

HOMOSEXUALITY WOULD SPREAD TO

01:26:15.670 --> 01:26:17.639
OTHER PRISONERS.

01:26:17.705 --> 01:26:19.207

01:26:37.425 --> 01:26:38.059
TRIANGLE.

01:26:38.126 --> 01:26:39.327
THE EMBLEM THE HOMOSEXUALS HAD

01:26:39.394 --> 01:26:40.662

01:26:40.728 --> 01:26:42.664
IN CONCENTRATION CAMPS.

01:26:42.730 --> 01:26:43.665

PERSEVERANCE OF PEOPLE WHO WOULD

01:27:42.190 --> 01:27:44.659

HERE THANK YOU.

01:29:08.576 --> 01:29:09.577
OF THE MILLIONS THAT PERISHED

01:29:09.644 --> 01:29:10.912
DURING THE HOLOCAUST WOMEN WERE

01:29:10.978 --> 01:29:12.647
SUBJECTED TO SOME OF THE MOST

01:29:12.714 --> 01:29:13.815
INHUMANE TREATMENT.

01:29:13.881 --> 01:29:15.383
MOTHERS WERE SEPARATED FROM

01:29:15.450 --> 01:29:16.784
THEIR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES AND

01:29:16.851 --> 01:29:18.486
MOTHERS WERE OFTEN MARCHED INTO

01:29:18.553 --> 01:29:19.987
THE GAS CHAMBERS WITH THEIR

01:29:20.054 --> 01:29:21.022
CHILDREN.

01:29:21.089 --> 01:29:22.990
I REMEMBER THAT AT THE TIME MOST

01:29:23.057 --> 01:29:24.192
OF THE PEOPLE WHO WERE SENT TO

01:29:24.258 --> 01:29:25.460
THE CONCENTRATION CAMPS KNEW

01:29:25.526 --> 01:29:27.261
FULL WELL THE FATE THAT WAS

01:29:27.328 --> 01:29:29.897
GOING TO AWAIT THEM THEY KNEW

01:29:29.964 --> 01:29:30.498
THAT THEY WERE GOING TO THEIR

01:29:30.565 --> 01:29:30.732
DEATH.

01:29:30.798 --> 01:29:32.233
IMAGINE BEING ONE OF THOSE WOMEN

01:29:32.300 --> 01:29:34.001
HAVING TO MARCH INTO A GAS

01:29:34.068 --> 01:29:37.071
CHAMBER WITH YOUR CHILDREN.

01:29:37.138 --> 01:29:38.406
AND THEN TO HAVE TO WATCH THEM

01:29:38.473 --> 01:29:41.075
SUCCUMB TO THE GASES BEFORE YOU

01:29:41.142 --> 01:29:42.877
TWO MET YOUR DEATH I CAN'T THINK

01:29:42.944 --> 01:29:44.312
OF ANYTHING MORE HORRIFYING AS A

01:29:44.378 --> 01:29:46.848
MOTHER MYSELF.

01:29:46.914 --> 01:29:48.216
JEWISH AND GYPSY WOMEN WERE

01:29:48.282 --> 01:29:50.885
OFTEN RAPED AND TORTURED BY NOT

01:29:50.952 --> 01:29:52.286
SEASON WERE SUBJECTED.

01:29:52.353 --> 01:29:53.721
TO HORRIFIC EXPERIMENTS AND

01:29:53.788 --> 01:29:55.790
EXPERIMENTS THAT IF THEY SURVIVE

01:29:55.857 --> 01:29:57.725
LET THEM SEVERAL.

01:29:57.792 --> 01:30:00.328
AND DISFIGURED.

01:30:00.394 --> 01:30:01.829
YESTERDAY MEMBERS OF THE JEWISH

01:30:01.896 --> 01:30:04.398
CAUCUS IN MY MYSELF AMONGST THEM.

01:30:04.465 --> 01:30:06.200
HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF SITTING

01:30:06.267 --> 01:30:07.468
DOWN IN A ROUND TABLE WITH A

01:30:07.535 --> 01:30:09.470
GROUP OF HOLOCAUST SURVIVORS I

01:30:09.537 --> 01:30:11.105
GOT TO MEET A WOMAN NAME RENEE

01:30:11.172 --> 01:30:12.974
FIRESTONE WHO WAS TWENTY YEARS

01:30:13.040 --> 01:30:14.609
OLD WHEN ALONG WITH HER PARENTS

01:30:14.675 --> 01:30:15.743
SHE WAS SENT BY CATTLE CARS TO

01:30:15.810 --> 01:30:17.378
AUSCHWITZ.

01:30:17.445 --> 01:30:20.014
NOW HER FOURTEEN YEAR OLD SISTER.

01:30:20.081 --> 01:30:21.983
WAS ONE OF THOSE WHO WAS

01:30:22.049 --> 01:30:24.619
SUBJECTED TO INCREDIBLY CRUEL

01:30:24.685 --> 01:30:27.388
AND INHUMANE MEDICAL EXPERIMENTS

01:30:27.455 --> 01:30:28.923
AND THEN EXECUTED BY THE ****.

01:30:28.990 --> 01:30:30.558
RENEE HERSELF SOMEHOW SURVIVE

01:30:30.625 --> 01:30:32.393
MIRACULOUSLY BUT SHE DIDN'T JUST

01:30:32.460 --> 01:30:34.061
SURVIVE SHE WENT ON TO BECOME

01:30:34.128 --> 01:30:35.129
ONE OF THE MOST INFLUENTIAL

01:30:35.196 --> 01:30:36.297
FASHION DESIGNERS OF THE

01:30:36.364 --> 01:30:37.832
TWENTIETH CENTURY.

01:30:37.899 --> 01:30:39.400
SHE THRIVED.

01:30:39.467 --> 01:30:41.135
AND TO ME ONE OF THE GREAT

01:30:41.202 --> 01:30:42.970
LESSONS OF THE HOLOCAUST IS ONE

01:30:43.037 --> 01:30:44.338
OF SURVIVAL.

01:30:44.405 --> 01:30:48.643
AND OF SUCCESS AFTER SURVIVING.

01:30:48.709 --> 01:30:50.211
AND THAT SHOWS THAT EVERYTHING

01:30:50.278 --> 01:30:51.779
THAT HITLER DID.

01:30:51.846 --> 01:30:53.714
WAS PROVEN TO BE A GREAT FAILURE

01:30:53.781 --> 01:30:56.083
A FAILURE FOR HIS NATION THE

01:30:56.150 --> 01:30:56.717
FAILURE FOR THOSE WHO FOLLOWED

01:30:56.784 --> 01:30:58.920
HIM -- TO THEIR GREAT SHAME HER

01:30:58.986 --> 01:31:01.088
FAILURE TO TO GERMANY THAT STILL

01:31:01.155 --> 01:31:04.192
LIVES ON BUT THOSE WHO SURVIVED

01:31:04.258 --> 01:31:06.627
WERE ABLE TO CONTINUE REBUILD.

01:31:06.694 --> 01:31:07.728
EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE SCATTERED

01:31:07.795 --> 01:31:09.697
THROUGHOUT THE WORLD AND I THINK

01:31:09.764 --> 01:31:11.632
IT'S THAT SURVIVAL THAT SO MANY

01:31:11.699 --> 01:31:13.201
OF US DRAW INSPIRATION FROM

01:31:13.267 --> 01:31:14.368
TODAY.

01:31:14.435 --> 01:31:15.903
NO I WANT TO MENTION TO IS TO DO

01:31:15.970 --> 01:31:17.004
ONE THING THAT I THINK IS NOT

01:31:17.071 --> 01:31:18.773
OFTEN OBVIOUSTO PEOPLE WHO ARE

01:31:18.840 --> 01:31:20.007
NOT JEWISH.

01:31:20.074 --> 01:31:21.809
AND MY FAMILY WE HAVE SURVIVORS

01:31:21.876 --> 01:31:23.544
IN MY FAMILY AND MY

01:31:23.611 --> 01:31:25.213
GRANDFATHER'S FAMILY.

01:31:25.279 --> 01:31:26.848
OF THE ENTIRE FAMILY TREE WAS

01:31:26.914 --> 01:31:27.915
WIPED OUT ONLY A FEW PEOPLE

01:31:27.982 --> 01:31:29.584
SURVIVED.

01:31:29.650 --> 01:31:31.485
BUT MANY OF US ONLY HAVE JUDAISM

01:31:31.552 --> 01:31:33.254
AS THE CORE OF OUR IDENTITY I

01:31:33.321 --> 01:31:35.289
ONLY RECENTLY FOUND OUT THAT I

01:31:35.356 --> 01:31:36.390
HAVE FAMILY FROM LAFIA.

01:31:36.457 --> 01:31:38.392
THOSE ROUTES WERE WIPED AWAY FOR

01:31:38.459 --> 01:31:39.727
SO MANY OF US IN THOSE FAMILY

01:31:39.794 --> 01:31:41.662
STORIES MY GRANDPARENTS MANY OF

01:31:41.729 --> 01:31:43.064
THEIR GENERATION REFUSED TO

01:31:43.130 --> 01:31:44.465
SPEAK ABOUT EXPERIENCES THAT

01:31:44.532 --> 01:31:45.600
THEY HAD.

01:31:45.666 --> 01:31:46.667
WE'RE ONLY LEARNING ABOUT THAT

01:31:46.734 --> 01:31:47.835
NOW FROM SURVIVORS WHO ARE

01:31:47.902 --> 01:31:49.303
WILLING TO SPEAK AND WHO ARE

01:31:49.370 --> 01:31:50.371
WILLING TO COME FORWARD AND GIVE

01:31:50.438 --> 01:31:51.973
ORAL HISTORIES AND TALK ABOUT

01:31:52.039 --> 01:31:53.574
WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM.

01:31:53.641 --> 01:31:54.976
MOST OF MY FAMILY'S HISTORY IS

01:31:55.042 --> 01:31:57.078
LOST ITS LUSTER TIME I DON'T

01:31:57.144 --> 01:31:57.645
EVEN KNOW WHERE IN THE WORLD

01:31:57.712 --> 01:31:59.046
THEY COME FROM.

01:31:59.113 --> 01:32:00.348
WE'RE JUST TRYING TO PUT ALL OF

01:32:00.414 --> 01:32:01.616
THAT BACK TOGETHER AGAIN AND

01:32:01.682 --> 01:32:03.017
WE'LL NEVER KNOW MOST OF THOSE

01:32:03.084 --> 01:32:03.918
STORIES.

01:32:03.985 --> 01:32:05.686
SO I I PERSONALLY WANT TO THANK

01:32:05.753 --> 01:32:07.188

01:32:07.255 --> 01:32:09.123
THEIR VOICES TO BRING THAT

01:32:09.190 --> 01:32:11.125
HISTORY BACK TO LIFE FOR SO MANY

01:35:22.583 --> 01:35:24.552
MOST EFFICIENTLY IN ORDER TO

01:35:24.618 --> 01:35:26.020
SAVE BULLETS WAS TO TIE THREE
