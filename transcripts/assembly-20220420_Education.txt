GO AHEAD THANK YOU A GOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS I WOULD LIKE TO START BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AND THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR THOUGHTFUL FEEDBACK AB TWENTY FOUR SIXTY FIVE IS INSPIRED BY RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S TASK FORCE TO IMPROVE READING BY THIRD GRADE. THIS BILL CREATES A GRANT PROGRAM TO ENGAGE FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES AND IMPROVING LITERACY AND BY LITERACY OUTCOMES TO REALIZE THE VISION OF UNIVERSAL CHILDHOOD LITERACY BY THIRD GRADE LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES WILL BE ABLE TO APPLY FOR GRANT FUNDS TO DESIGN A FAMILY LITERACY IN BY LITERACY INNOVATION PLAN INCORPORATING THREE OF THE FOLLOWING FIVE STRATEGIES INCLUDING FAMILY LITERACY PLANS. FAMILY LITERACY HOME VISITING PROGRAMS BILINGUAL FAMILY LITERACY FROM A TODAS OR OUTREACH COORDINATORS EXTENDED DAY SUMMER OR WEAKENED INSTITUTES RELATED TO LITERACY IN BY LITERACY AND LIBRARY FAMILY LITERACY PARTNERSHIPS AB TWENTY FOUR SIXTY FIVE ALSO AUTHORIZES FUNDING FOR DIGITAL TOOLS TO PROMOTE FAMILY LITERACY PURPOSE MEMBERS I WANTED THAT THIS IS THE FIRST BILL I AGREE TO AUTHOR THIS ISSUE IS VERY PERSONAL TO ME- PRIOR TO JOINING YOU ON THE GREEN CARPET I SPENT MY CAREER LEADING NONPROFITS FOCUSED ON IMPROVING EDUCATIONAL OUTPUTS OUTCOMES FOR STUDENTS EXPERIENCING POVERTY PARTICULARLY FOCUSED ON EARLY LITERACY WE KNOW THAT STUDENTS WHO ARE ABLE TO READ BY THIRD GRADE ARE FOUR TIMES MORE LIKELY TO GRADUATE THAN STUDENTS WHO ARE UNABLE TO DO SO. AND CURRENTLY ACCORDING TO THE NATION'S REPORT CARD ONLY 32% OF CALIFORNIA'S FOURTH GRADERS ARE READING PROFICIENTLY. THESE RESULTS BUT CALIFORNIA BELOW THE NATIONAL AVERAGE AND BEHIND TWENTY FIVE OTHER STATES. FURTHER THE DATA DEMONSTRATES RACIAL DISPARITIES IN READING PROFICIENCY IN TWENTY NINETEEN ONLY 18% OF BLACK FOURTH GRADERS. TESTED PROFICIENT PROFICIENTLY COMPARED 223% OF LATINO FOURTH GRADERS. AND 45% OF WHAT FOURTH GRADERS. THE RESEARCH MAKES IT CLEAR THAT AS LITERACY IS THE FOUNDATION FOR EDUCATIONAL SUCCESS. LITERACY IS THE KEY TO EQUITY AND WITH A STRONG CORRELATION BETWEEN LITERACY AND HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION. LITERACY IS A PATH TO BREAKING THE SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE. WITH THAT I HAVE MEET WITH ME TESTIFYING TODAY THE ARE A REPRESENTATIVE FROM STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION OFFICE. MR TONY THURMOND AND- ALEXANDER DE CAPRIO SENIOR STRATEGIST AT FIRST FIVE CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU YOUR WITNESSES OR WITNESSES HERE ONE IS OKAY I'M SORRY. YOUR RECEIPT AN AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MY NAME IS ALEX DA CAPRIO AND I'M A SENIOR STRATEGIST AT FIRST SIGHT CALIFORNIA THE STATE'S COMMISSION ON CHILDREN AND FAMILIES THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO BE HERE TODAY. AT FIRST FIVE CALIFORNIA OUR GOAL IS TO ENSURE ALL CHILDREN ZERO TO FIVE HAVE THE SAFE STABLE NURTURING RELATIONSHIPS AND ENVIRONMENTS NECESSARY TO ACHIEVE HEALTHY DEVELOPMENT AND EARLY LITERACY IS A KEY STRATEGY TO SUPPORT THIS GOAL. TO TRULY PREPARE CHILDREN FOR CALIFORNIA'S FUTURE AND REDUCE ACHIEVEMENT DISPARITIES A SOLID FOUNDATION OF EARLY LITERACY SKILLS AS NECESSARY. RESEARCH DOES THE ROOTS OF THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP START LONG BEFORE CHILDREN ENTER KINDERGARTEN A MAJOR INDICATOR FOR LATER SCHOOL SUCCESS AS LANGUAGE AND EARLY LITERACY DEVELOPMENT AND DISPARITIES REALLY VOCABULARY GROWTH BETWEEN CHILDREN FROM LOW SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS AND HIGHER SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS HAVE BEEN SHOWN CHILDREN AS EARLY AS SIXTEEN MONTHS OF AGE. READING ALSO PROMOTES THE TYPE OF NURSE NURTURING INTERACTIONS THAT ARE BENEFICIAL FOR BOTH CHILDREN AND ADULTS AS WE KNOW ALL TOO WELL THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS BROUGHT ISOLATION AND EXTREME STRESS TO OUR FAMILIES AND WE PLAY LITERACY AS AN IMPORTANT STRATEGY TO HELP FAMILIES BOND CREATE NURTURING SPACES AND MOMENTS BETWEEN PARENT CHILD AND PROVIDE MITIGATION AGAINST ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES. BUT IN ORDER FOR THIS TO OCCUR IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE ARE FAMILIES WITH THE TOOLS AND INFORMATION THEY NEED TO ENGAGE WITH THEIR CHILD AROUND BOOKS AND OTHER LITERACY RESOURCES. FOR THESE REASONS FIRST I CALIFORNIA'S IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY FOUR SIXTY FIVE AND IT IS AS EXCITED ABOUT THE POTENTIAL IT HOLDS FAMILY ENGAGEMENT IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT WHEN IT COMES TO IMPROVING THE LITERACY OF YOUNG CHILDREN BECAUSE AS WE KNOW. LITERACY IS MORE THAN JUST GETTING A BOOK INTO A CHILD'S HAND THIS BILL ACKNOWLEDGES THE CRITICAL ROLE THAT FAMILIES PLAY IN THEIR CHILDREN'S SCHOOL SUCCESS AND TARGETS RESOURCES TO THE CHILDREN AND FAMILIES WHO NEED IT MOST. THE CALIFORNIA FAMILY LITERACY INNOVATION PROJECT AS PROPOSED IN AB TWENTY FOUR SIXTY FIVE WOULD ESTABLISH A STRONG AND- THE NEW SUPPORT AND CREATE. A C. I. INCLUDING STE. LIKE FAMILY LAW. PLAN AND HOME. THIS LEGISLATION ENSURES THAT FAMILIES SEE THEIR IMPORTANT ROLE IN THEIR CHILD'S LITERACY DEVELOPMENT. AND HAVE ACCESS TO INDIVIDUALIZED RESOURCES TO MEET THEIR CHILD'S NEEDS FOR THESE REASONS I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST DRIVE OUT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. MISTER SUPERINTENDENT AS WALKED IN. GOOD AFTERNOON. THANK YOU SO CHAIR. MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- PLEASED TO BE HERE TO PROVIDE THAT TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY FOUR SIXTY FIVE I LIKE TO ALIGN MYSELF. WITH THE COMMENTS THAT YOU JUST HEARD. AND THANK OUR WONDERFUL AUTHOR FOR. A LEADERSHIP IN STATE. OF THIS ISSUE- I THINK THE CONTACT HAS BEEN SET FOR YOU ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF LITERACY. AND WHEN YOU PLAN- FAMILY ENGAGEMENT IN THAT CONVERSATION MAKING SURE THAT FAMILIES UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF. READING HAVE ACCESS TO BOOKS AND MULTI CULTURAL SUPPORTS WE KNOW THAT WE CAN HELP OUR FAMILIES GET THEIR- THIS IS A GAME CHANGER AND YOU ALL KNOW THAT WE'VE ESTABLISHED AN EFFORT TO ENSURE THAT ALL CHILDREN LEARN TO READ BY THIRD GRADE. AS OUR CHILDREN THE COMING OUT OF THE PANDEMIC I CAN'T THINK OF A MORE IMPORTANT SKILL TO BUILD FOR THEM. C. TO ENSURE THAT THEY GRADUATE IN A PREPARED FOR A GREAT FUTURE I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE ON AB TWENTY FOUR SIXTY FIVE. THANK YOU. DO YOU HAVE OTHER WITNESSES AND SUPPORTER THAT IS THAT IF YOU'RE TO INITIATIVE. BOB BUT WITH THAT OTHERS IN SUPPORT MAY COME FORWARD. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS JEFF FROST REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL LIBRARY ASSOCIATION WERE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL AS IT HAS BEEN PARED DOWN AND AMENDED. IF I COULD I JUST WANTED TO VERY QUICKLY NOTE THAT ONE OF THE ELEMENTS ELIMINATED FROM THE BILL WAS AN UPDATE OF CALIFORNIA'S MODEL SCHOOL LIBRARY STANDARDS. I WOULD URGE YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN TO TAKE THIS ISSUE UP IN THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE BECAUSE IT REALLY DOESN'T NEED ANY MONEY- WHAT IT REALLY NEEDS TO SLIP A SLATE OF A FORTY TO MOVE FORWARD AND THANK YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THAT THANK YOU. YES THE LEVEL CALIFORNIANS TOGETHER INSTRUCTS APART. JENNIFER BAKER WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION FOR BILINGUAL EDUCATION IN SUPPORT THANK YOU IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION IN THE ROOM. A SINGLE OPPOSITION WILL BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE- THIS IS PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS WE CAN DO SUPPORTING EARLY LITERACY. IT'S REALLY NOT EVEN EARLY LITERACY WRITERS LITERACY- IF A CHILD LEAVES THE THIRD GRADE NOT READING AT GRADE LEVEL THERE'S A WILL. READ AT GRADE LEVEL SO THIS ISSUE IS HUGE IT'S SOMETHING THE STATE. HAS GRAPPLED WITH FOR YEARS AND STILL DOES SO I APPRECIATE YOUR ATTENTION TO IT. BECAUSE YOU GET IT THIS IS IT RIGHT HERE. THIS IS A BIG BIG DEAL- IT'S LEARN TO READ. WRITE AND THEN READ THE LOOKING AT READ LEARN LEARN TO READ WRITE. LEARN TO READ READ LEARN- SO I APPRECIATE THE BILL AND I APPRECIATE THE EFFORT AND RECOGNIZE THAT MORE RESOURCES NEED TO GO INTO THIS EFFORT- AND AGAIN THANK YOU. SO THAT I ANY OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS WHICH COMMON. SAYING NO OTHER- OF COMMENTS DO. YOU KNOW HOW WE DON'T WE DON'T KNOW FORM YET SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO WAIT. TO MAKE A MOTION.

GOOD AFTERNOON AGAIN FIRST I WANT TO SHARE THAT I ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE'S SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS AS OUTLINED ON PAGE FOURTEEN OF THE ANALYSIS AND I WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOUR COMMITTEE FOR THEIR PATIENCE AND ENGAGEMENTS ON THIS ISSUE. AB NINETEEN TWELVE CREATES A NEW PROCESS FOR SCHOOLS IN FINANCIAL DISTRESS. WHO NEED TO FOLLOW THAT THEY NEED TO FOLLOW WHEN CONSIDERING SCHOOL CLOSURE INC STOCK AND CONSOLIDATIONS AS A FORMER SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER I KNOW THAT SCHOOL CLOSURES NOT EASY DECISIONS TO MAKE THEY ARE EMOTIONAL DECISIONS. IMPACTING COMMUNITY MEMBERS TEACHERS STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES. IF NOT DONE TRANSPARENCY TRANSPARENTLY WITH COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT THERE'S A MISTRUST IN THE PROCESS THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED WITH MY CONSTITUENTS AND HOW THEY ARE FEELING NOW WITH RECENT DECISIONS MADE. IN THE OAKLAND UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT FEELING PRSSURE TO MAKE A DECISION IN ORDER TO GET THE TEN MILLION DOLLARS PROMISED IN LAST BUDGET THE BOARD OF A USD SWIFT COMPILED TO SCHOOLS SLATED FOR CLOSURE CONSOLIDATION COMMUNITY THERE WAS CONFUSION SHOCK AND DISBELIEF ABOUT THIS PRECIPITOUS ACTION PARENTS STUDENTS AND HUNGER STRIKERS PROTESTED I SPENT HOURS WITH ALL OF THEM TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE DISTRICT COULD HAVE DONE DIFFERENTLY INCLUDING WITH BOARD MEMBERS AND STILL THE COMMUNITY STUDENTS FAMILIES DO NOT HAVE A RESOLUTION IN FACT TO THE ACLU HAS CURRENTLY BROUGHT ACTION AGAINST. THE UST SCHOOL DISTRICT TO TRY TO RECTIFY THE SITUATION THIS IS WHY AB NINETEEN TWELVE IS VERY PERSONAL TO ME AND IT'S PERSONAL TO STUDENTS EDUCATORS SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS AND SCHOOL BOARD MEMBERS AS WELL WHO CAN AVAIL THEMSELVES OF NOT ONLY A FINANCIAL ANALYSIS- AT BUT ALSO THE OTHER KINDS OF ANALYSES THAT WILL ALLOW FOR MAKING THESE CRITICAL DECISIONS. AB NINETEEN TWELVE WILL REQUIRE SCHOOLS IN FINANCIAL DISTRESS DEFINED AS SCHOOLS THAT HAVE A STUDENT A STATE LOAN OR UNDER RECEIVERSHIP TO CONDUCT AN EQUITY IMPACT ANALYSIS. TO GUIDE THE IDENTIFICATION OF SCHOOLS TO BE CLOSED OR CONSOLIDATED. THIS EQUITY IMPACT ANALYSIS MINIMUM WILL NEED TO LOOK AT A NUMBER OF METRICS THAT INCLUDE. OPERATING COST OF A SCHOOL AND THE ASSOCIATED SAVINGS RESULTING FROM A SCHOOL CLOSURE OR CONSOLIDATION. SPECIAL PROGRAMS AVAILABLE AT THE SCHOOLS BEING CONSIDERED FOR CLOSURE OR CONSOLIDATION AND WHETHER THOSE PROGRAMS WILL BE PROVIDED AT THE SAME CURRENT LEVEL AT THE SCHOOLS TO WHICH PEOPLE TO BE DIVERTED. AND BALANCE OF PEOPLE DEMOGRAPHICS INCLUDING RACE OR ETHNICITY PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES ENGLISH LEARNERS FOSTER YOUTH AND HOMELESS YOUTH IN THE SCHOOLS BEING CONSIDERED FOR CLOSURE OR CONSOLIDATION. BUILDER REX THE SCHOOL SENT THE METRICS THAT WILL BE USED IN THEIR EQUITY IMPACT ANALYSIS AT THE BOARD MEETING. ONCE A LIST OF PROPOSED SCHOOL SCHOOL CLOSURES IS DEVELOPED THE BOARD WILL PRESENT THAT LIST OF THE COMMUNITY AND SHARE HOW IT IDENTIFIED THE SCHOOLS. ON THE FOUR ON THE LIST AT A MINIMUM THE PORTAL SHARE WITH THE COMMUNITY THE FOLLOWING FACTORS USED TO IDENTIFY THE LIST OF SCHOOL CLOSURES OR CONSOLIDATIONS EQUITY IMPACT ANALYSIS FINDINGS FOR EACH SCHOOL CLOSURE OR CONSOLIDATION. PLAN FOR THE USE OF THE SCHOOLS PROPOSED FOR CLOSURE CONSOLIDATION ONCE IT BECOMES A VACATED FACILITY. CRITERIA USED TO ASSIGN DISPLACED PEOPLE TO OTHER SUCH SCHOOL SITES OR DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCESS OF REASSIGNMENT THAT WILL BE USED BY THE SCHOOL DISTRICT AND- OPTIONS AND TIMELINE FOR TRANSITIONING PEOPLE'S TO THEIR NEW SCHOOLS INCLUDING IMPROVING SAFE ROUTES TO SCHOOL. AND SCHOOLS INTERSECTIONS. AB NINETEEN TWELVE DIRECTS THE BOARD TO TAKE FEEDBACK INTO CONSTRICTED RATIONING WHEN DEVELOPING ITS FINAL LIST OF SCHOOL CLOSURES. THIS BILL IS A DIRECT RESPONSE TO WHAT HAPPENED IN MY DISTRICT BUT QUITE FRANKLY WITH THE IT WILL IMPACT OTHER DISTRICTS ARE FACING DIFFICULT DECISIONS REGARDING SCHOOL CLOSURES IN THE FUTURE. HERE WITH ME TO TESTIFY TODAY IN ORDER THE BILL ARE KATE HARDIMAN WITH THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION AND KIMBERLY ROSS AND BURGER WITH SEAD. GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE MEMBERS KATE KATIE HARTMAN WITH THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION. I APOLOGIZE THEY RAN HERE FROM SENATE AD SO I'M STILL OUT OF BREATH- IT THESE DAYS IN SUPPORT OF AB NINETEEN TWELVE AND WE WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLYMEMBER BONTA FOR HER LEADERSHIP. SCHOOLS ARE THE BACKBONE OF OUR COMMUNITIES AND CTA BELIEVES SCHOOL CLOSURES ARE DISRUPTIVE AND DETRIMENTAL TO THE EDUCATION OF STUDENTS THEIR FAMILIES AND THE COMMUNITIES THAT THEY LIVE IN. DECISIONS AROUND SCHOOL CLOSURES SHOULD NOT BE TAKEN LIGHTLY AND SHOULD BE MADE YOU SHOULD NOT BE MADE UNILATERALLY BY WHATEVER SCHOOL CLOSURES ARE CONSIDERED ALL THE IMPACTS ON THE COMMUNITY SHOULD BE CONSIDERED INCLUDING DISPROPORTIONAL IMPACT ON BOTH VULNERABLE STUDENT GROUPS. DEFINITELY THE PROCESS FOR CLOSURE SHOULD BE TRANSPARENT AND INCLUDE INPUT FROM COMMUNITY MEMBERS. THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE- A SCHOOL DISTRICT IN FISCAL DISCRET DISTRESS TO CONDUCT AN EQUITY IMPACT ANALYSIS BEFORE APPROVING ANY MERGERS WE BELIEVE SCHOOL DISTRICTS SOULD ALREADY BE DOING THAT. PRACTICE AT THE CENTRAL IN MITIGATING THE NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. BUT STUDENTS. ALL STUDENTS DESERVE ACCESS TO A QUALITY EDUCATION IN OUR COMMUNITY AND THIS BILL SIMPLY REQUIRE SCHOOL DISTRICTS. ALL OF THE IMPACT. ON STUDENTS AND FAMILIES FOR PROVING SCHOOL CLOSURES AYE URGENT AYE VOTE ON THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU THAT. CAN ROSENBERGER WITH S. WE REPRESENT THE MOST POPULOUS SCHOOL DISTRICTS INCLUDING OAKLAND AND THE IMPACT THAT THOSE CLOSURES HAD IN THE MANNER IN WHICH WAS DONE WAS DEVASTATING NOT ONLY TO THE COMMUNITY BUT THE WORK FORCE IN THE STUDENTS- PUBLIC SCHOOLS CANNOT OPERATE IN THE SAME WAY AS BUSINESSES IN BLACK AND WHITE AND DOLLARS AND CENTS OR NEEDS TO BE A WHOLE PICTURE- AND WE BELIEVE THIS BILL TAKES AN IMPORTANT FIRST STEP AND LOOKING AT THE EQUITY. AND OTHER FACTORS THAT IMPROVE THE COMMUNITY AND THOSE THAT ARE- THE STUDENTS IN THE WORK FORCE AS WELL- IT THIS ISN'T JUST. PERSON IF FOR ALMONDS IN A LOW INCOME HI NEED FORMAL POPULATIONS- AND WE ARE SEEING CONSISTENTLY AND MORE RECENTLY HAPPENING IN URBAN AREAS SO WE BELIEVE THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT FIRST STEP. AND WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR THE AUTHOR FOR HAVING THIS CONVERSATION AND ADDING THE EQUITY LINES AND BRING THE COMMUNITY IT. SENATE DR- THANK YOU OTHERS IN THE ROOM IS. MAKE TO MICROPHONE. GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I WITH YOUR INDULGENCE PAMELA GIVES REPRESENTING THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS WELL WE DO NOT HAVE A POSITION ON THE BILL WE ARE VERY INTERESTED IN THE EQUITY IMPACT ANALYSIS PROVISIONS OF THE BILL AND THE OTHER PROVISIONS STATED. BY OUR COLLEAGUES AND THE POOR TO WORKING WITH THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER TO MOVE THE BILL FORWARD THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OPPOSITION TO THE BILL- ZENO OPPOSITION TO THE BILL I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR- YOU ARE US BECAUSE IT'S COMING TO A NEIGHBORHOOD. NEAR ME NEAR EVERY MEMBER IN THIS ROOM SO. IT'S SCHOOL CLOSURES. RIGHT THE POPULATION THE STUDENT POPULATION THAT BUBBLE. IS ABOUT WHAT. EIGHT YEARS AHEAD OF US NOW SO IT STARTED TO DROP. ON THE NATURAL FOR RADIO FACTORS. AND SO EVERY MEMBER. IN THIS LEGISLATURE IS GOING TO HAVE TO GRAPPLE ONE ISSUE. THAT CAME TO YOU FIRST. SO I APPRECIATE YOUR CONCERN FOR YOUR OWN COMMUNITY BUT A GREAT VOICE. FOR YOUR WN COMMUNITY IN YOUR YOUR THIS IS THE FIRST WAVE AND IT'S HITTING YOU. AND YOU'RE HERE YOU'RE TRYING TO MANAGE IT AND IT'S BEEN TOUGH. I KNOW I KNOW IT'S TOUGH- AND YOU'RE KIND OF. RIGHT NOW YOU'RE KIND OF. BUILD A PLACE YOU FLAG IS HOW DO WE RESPOND WHEN IT DISTRICT- IN THE EYES OF MANY- ACTED HASTE. WITH HASTE AND DIDN'T REALLY INCLUDE THE COMMUNITY AND GET ADEQUATE INPUT SO I COMMEND YOU. FOR STANDING UP. FOR THE SCHOOLS FOR THE SCHOOLS OR DISTRICTS. I WOULD SAY ONE WAY WE CAN ADDRESS THIS ISSUE THOUGH. ACROSS THE STATE THIS. THING WRONG SMALL SCHOOL. RIGHT THE DISTRICTS HAVE TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD IT RIGHT NOW. DISTRICTS CANNOT AFFORD SMALL SCHOOLS. SO WE NEED TO DO. AND BUDGET BECAUSE THE MONEY WILL BE THERE AND THAT'S ONGOING MONEY. TO ADD TO THE BASE. . GOVERNOR'S OFFER A PROPOSAL THIS WILL CHANGE IS FIVE POINT THREE THREE WILL. THE NAME BE INFLATION. NOR'EASTERS A PURSE COSTS THERE OTHER COST PRESSURES ON DISTRICT PLANNING ROMAN EXETER. RIGHT WE REALLY NEED TO RAISE THAT BASE TO KIND OF STAVE OFF. SOME OF THE SITUATIONS- THE SITUATION IF YOU WILL THAT'S OCCURRING IN YOUR DISTRICT BECAUSE- IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN EITHER WAY. BUT THE SAME TIME IT CAN BE LESSENED IF DISTRICTS ARE BETTER FINANCED. BECAUSE IT THEIR DISTRICTS ARE MAKING FINANCIAL. ISSUES WHICH HAVE HUMAN IMPACT SO I APPRECIATE THAT YOU'RE FIGHTING FOR YOUR DISTRICT HERE TODAY AND I HAVE BEEN IN THE PAST. AND APPRECIATE THE BILL. ARE THERE ARE OTHERS ON THE COMMITTEE THAT WISH TO COMMENT IS QUIRK-SILVA. THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND- I'VE HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH THE CHAIR ABOUT- ISSUE SIMILAR TO THIS I MEAN WHAT WE ALREADY KNOW IS THE DATA THAT SHOWS. THAT NOT ONLY IS DECLINING ENROLLMENT REAL IT'S NOT JUST A- SHORT PERIOD IT'S BEEN LONG TERM NOW- BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT SOME OF THE YOUNGER GENERATION IS ALSO CHOOSING NOT TO HAVE CHILDREN. THAT'S ANOTHER FACTOR THAT WILL PLAY INTO THIS. BUT THE OTHER QUESTION IS HOW SMALL IS TOO SMALL WHEN WE TALK ABOUT IT. X. I HAVE SOME DISTRICTS THAT ARE. LITERALLY UNDER FIVE THOUSAND- STUDENTS THAT ARC THAT WERE FIVE THOUSAND NOW CLOSER TO THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED SO. I THINK. THERE'S A LOT TO TALK ABOUT BUT ONE THING THAT I WANTED TO ASK ABOUT THIS I. DEFINITELY SUPPORT THIS BILL IS ON THE EQUITY IMPACT ANALYSIS. IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'VE SEEN FIRST HAND MANY MANY YEARS AS A TEACHER. IS SOMETIMES ARE COMMUNITIES. OF COLOR- AS MUCH AS WE WANT TO THE INCLUDE THEM WHETHER IT'S LANGUAGE BARRIERS WHETHER IT'S WORK BARRIERS WHETHER IT'S- TRANSPORTATION ACCESS WHATEVER THE REASONS. WE DON'T ALWAYS GET THEM. AT WHETHER IT'S THE BOARD MEETING SO HOW IS THE OUT REACH GOING TO BE MADE TO THEM TO MAKE SURE. THAT THEIR INPUT IS REALLY INCLUDED BECAUSE ALL TOO OFTEN. IT'S WHOEVER SHOWS UP AT THAT BOARD ROOM THAT NIGHT AND THE BOARD IS THERE. AND THEN THEY GO WITH THE MAJORITY. I APPRECIATE THAT AND AT THAT QUITE FRANKLY- THAT KIND OF OUTRAGE THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN FOR COMMUNITIES PARTICULARLY COMMUNITIES OF COLOR IS WHY WE END UP WITH DIRE SITUATIONS WHERE PEOPLE ARE LITERALLY PUTTING THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE AND- HUNGER STRIKING BECAUSE THEY DON'T FEEL LIKE THEIR VOICES HAVE BEEN HEARD. OR REPRESENTED OR REFLECTED IN THAT SO THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR RAISING THOSE CONCERNS AND I TOTALLY AGREE WITH THE CHAIR- BACKED OUT WE NEED TO INCREASE OUR BASE FUNDING FORMULA- AND HOPE THAT WE DO THAT BUT I UNDERSTAND THAT IN THE MEANTIME- WHENEVER WE CLOSE A SCHOOL IT CLOSES DOWN. AN OPPORTUNITY FOR. STUDENTS TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THE ASSOCIATED WITH ONE SCHOOL. AT NEIGHBORHOODS GET INCREDIBLY IMPACTED BY SCHOOL CLOSURES. WHEN YOU CLOSE DOWN SCHOOLS TO CLOSE DOWN A LIFELINE TO HEALTH CARE SERVICES IN. A MINUTE PROVIDED PROVISION SOCIAL SERVICES AND ALL THOSE THINGS THAT SCHOOLS HAVE UNFORTUNATELY BEEN BURDENED WITH TAKING ON. WITHIN A COMMUNITY SO. WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK. FOR YOUR I. BOATS. OKAY I'LL TAKE THAT AS YOUR CLOTHES ON RIGHT THANK YOU AND AGAIN THANK YOU FOR THE BILL I JUST WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT EVEN A TRUE CHAMPION- FOR OAKLAND AND FOR THE FAMILIES WHO ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE SCHOOL CLOSURES AND HOW THEY'RE GOING TO ULTIMATELY IMPACT THEIR CHILDREN.

THIRTEEN AND IT MIGHT WHEN READY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT AB TWENTY SIX THIRTY EIGHT WHICH WILL ENSURE THAT EVERY CALIFORNIA PUBLIC CASE THROUGH TWELVE STUDENT TEACHER AND STAFF MEMBER FREE SAFE AND APPEALING DRINKING WATER BY REQUIRING THE INSTALLATION OF WATER BOTTLE FILLING STATIONS IN SCHOOLS THAT ARE EASILY ACCESSIBLE. LIKE TO START BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AND THANKS COMMITTEE STAFFER WORKING WITH MY OFFICE ON THE BILL. I AM BRINGING THIS BILL BEFORE YOU TODAY BECAUSE SIMPLY- BUT QUITE SIMPLY CHILDREN ARE NOT CONSUMING THE AMOUNT OF WATER THEY NEED. TO BE HEALTHY. A 200-092-2012 NATIONAL SURVEY FOUND THAT ONE IN TWO CHILDREN AGE SIX TO NINETEEN IN THE U. S. AT THAT TIME WERE NOT ADEQUATELY HYDRATED WITH DISPARITIES BY RACE AND GENDER. THINGS HAVEN'T GOTTEN BETTER ON A GIVEN DAY CHILDREN WHO DO NOT DRINK ANY WATER CONSUME TWICE THE CALORIES FROM SUGARY DRINKS WHEN COMPARED TO CHILDREN WHO DRINK WATER. RESEARCH SHOWS THAT TWO TO ELEVEN YEARS OF AGE AND TWELVE TO SEVENTEEN. CONSUME SUGARY DRINKS DAILY AND FOR EVERY ADDITIONAL SERVING OF SWEETENED BEVERAGES THAT A CHILD CONSUMES PER DAY THE LIKELIHOOD OF THE CHILD BECOMING OBESE INCREASES BY 60% CONSUMPTION OF IS LINKED TO CHRONIC DISEASES SUCH AS TYPE TWO DIABETES AND HEART DISEASE AND AS A RISK FACTOR FOR DENTAL CARIES AND WE KNOW THAT- OBESITY HAS BEEN IMPLICATED AS ONE OF THE GREAT ISSUES- THAT ARE IN EXISTING INVOLVED AND INVOLVED WITH- THE COVERT PANDEMIC. FOR SOME CHILDREN SCHOOL MAY BE THE MOST RELIABLE SOURCE OF SAFE AND APPEALING DRINKING WATER HOWEVER. ACCORDING TO A CHOICES LEARNING COLLABORATIVE PARTNERSHIP REPORT EXAMINING STRATEGIES TO PROVIDE IMPROVE ACCESS TO DRINKING WATER IN CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS ONE IN TEN SCHOOLS REPORTED HAVING. NO ACCESS TO FREE DRINKING WATER WHERE MEALS ARE SERVED DESPITE STATE AND FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS. THIS HAS TO CHANGE ADDITIONALLY ONLY ONE IN FIVE SCHOOLS REPORTED MEETING CRITERIA CONSIDERED THE STANDARD FOR EXCELLENCE IN WATER ACTS ACCESS. DRINKING WATER BENEFITS CHILDREN'S HEALTH IT'S THAT SIMPLE IT HELPS CHILDREN. DEVELOP STRONG MUSCLES JOINTS AND TISSUE AND IMPROVES THEIR DIGESTIVE SYSTEM KEEPS OUR BODIES HYDRATED. DRINKING WATER CAN ALSO POSITIVELY IMPACT CHILDREN'S COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE PARTICULARLY THEIR SHORT TERM MEMORY ON AVERAGE KIDS DRINK ABOUT TWO POINT FOUR OUNCES OF WATER DIRECTLY FROM WATER FOUNTAIN THAT'S ABOUT THE SIZE OF A CONDIMENT COP. IN SCHOOLS WHERE KIDS HAVE ACCESS TO WATER BOTTLE FILLING STATIONS THEIR WATER INTAKE CAN INCREASE BY AS MUCH AS TRIPLE. INCREASE ACCESS TO FREE SAFE AND APPEALING DRINKING WATER LEADS TO INCREASE CONSUMPTION WHICH HAS NUMEROUS PROVEN HEALTH BENEFITS LEADS TO IMPROVE HEALTH OUTCOMES AND HELPS IMPROVE STUDENTS PERFORMANCE IN THE CLASSROOM. SO EARLY PROMOTION AND EDUCATION ON THE BENEFITS OF CONSUMPTION OF WATER CAN HAVE POSITIVE LIFELONG IMPACTS ENGAGING IN THIS TYPE OF INTERVENTION IN THE K. THROUGH TWELVE SETTING AS AN AND DOT IDEAL I ENVIRONMENT TO ENCOURAGE THIS CRITICAL BEHAVIOR CHANGE NINE PLEASED TO BE JOINED TODAY. MISTER CHAIRMAN BURST BY LARA SAID TRAN A TEACHER IN THE TWIN RIVERS UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT AND DOCTOR AND NISHA PATEL A PEDIATRICIAN AND ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF PEDIATRICS AT STANFORD TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. THANK YOU TO YOUR FIRST WITNESS. RIGHT THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY FOR A TESTIMONY TODAY MY NAME IS DOCTOR NEED TO PATEL AS MENTIONED I'M A PEDIATRICIAN ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF PEDIATRICS AT STANFORD. I HAVE OVER FIFTEEN YEARS OF EXPERIENCE CONDUCTING RESEARCH ON CHRONIC DISEASE PREVENTION AMONG CHILDREN WITH PARTICULAR EXPERTISE ON DRINKING WATER IN SCHOOLS. I'M TODAY I'LL TELL YOU THREE REASONS WHY I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO SUPPORT THIS BILL FOR CHILDREN'S HEALTH AND LEARNING. FIRST I'M TO PROMOTE HEALTH WE WANT STUDENTS TO DRINK WATER NOT SUGARY DRINKS. WE KNOW THAT DRINKING WATER INSTEAD OF SUGARY BEVERAGES CAN HELP TO DECREASE OBESITY AS WELL AS PREVENT DENTAL CARIES. AND EITHER TWO OF THE MOST COMMON CHRONIC CONDITIONS AMONG YOUNG CHILDREN. BEFORE THE PANDEMIC WERE OVERWEIGHT TENNIS IS INCREASE OF STAND TO LEAD A 46% OVER THE PANDEMIC PERIOD. I'M THIS IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER TO ADDRESS IN ADDITION WE KNOW THAT PROVIDING WATER TO STUDENTS IMPROVE THEIR COGNITION. WHICH IS IMPORTANT FOR LEARNING. SECOND CHILDREN SPEND SUBSTANTIAL TIME IN SCHOOL SETTINGS. WE KNOW THAT CHILDREN PARTICULARLY THOSE OF COLOR UNDER HYDRATED. IN A STUDY OF LOS ANGELES STUDENTS WE FOUND THAT SIXTY THREE PERCENT. OF STUDENTS WERE UNDER HYDRATED AND WE KNOW THAT WATER FOUNTAINS WHEN THEY ARE ACCESSIBLE STUDENTS DON'T USE THEM. IN OUR STUDIES 326% OF STUDENTS WERE USING- CONTENTS AT SCHOOLS. AT LUNCH OR EVERY SAYS IT WILL BE INSTALL THESE WATER BOTTLE FILLING STATIONS. THEY ACTUALLY PROMOTE INCREASED WATER INTAKE AMONG STUDENTS. WE HAVE ONE STUDY COULD THAT WE JUST COMPLETED ACTUALLY. IN BAY AREA ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS AND THIS WAS A STUDY. THAT WAS CONDUCTED IN THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA AND WHAT WE FOUND IN THAT STUDY WAS THAT. IN SCHOOLS FOR STUDENTS HAD ACCESS TO NEWLY INSTALLED WATER STATIONS. THEIR ODDS OF BEING OVERWEIGHT REDUCED BY SEVENTY PERCENT. SO IN SOME I REALLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO SUPPORT THIS LEGISLATION. BECAUSE I THINK IT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT FOR CHILD HEALTH AND LEARNING. THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR ATTENTION THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS- MY NAME IS LAURA SATCHER AND I'M HERE TO VOICE MY SUPPORT FOR AB TWENTY SIX THIRTY EIGHT. THIS BILL IS IMPORTANT TO ME NOT ONLY BECAUSE I'M A HEART PATIENT- BUT I'M ALSO A MOTHER AND AN EDUCATOR. I TAUGHT GRADES K. EIGHT TO NINE SINCE THE EARLY NINETIES AND HAVE DEDICATED YEARS TO WORKING WITH CALIFORNIA'S UNDERSERVED POPULATION. AND WITNESSED FIRSTHAND THE STRUGGLE TO GET PROPER HYDRATION INTO THE SCHOOL SETTING. I'M CURRENTLY WORKING AS A TEACHER ON A SPECIAL ASSIGNMENT IN THE TWIN RIVERS UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. IN THIS ROLE I WORK WITH ARE MOST STRUGGLING SCHOOLS AND I'M CURRENTLY SERVING THE STUDENTS AT TWO OF OUR LOCAL HIGH SCHOOLS NOT ONLY TO RAISE GRADES ACROSS THE CURRICULUM. BUT TO RAISE TEST SCORES IMPROVE READING LEVELS SUPPORT STUDENTS WITH THEIR SOCIAL EMOTIONAL LEARNING REDUCE ABSENCES SUSPENSIONS. AND EXPULSIONS. IT WOULD BE IDEAL IF MY JOB IS AN EDUCATOR OR TO SIMPLY FOCUS FOCUS ENTIRELY ON THE ACADEMIC SIDE OF EDUCATION. BUT OUR STUDENTS COME TO SCHOOL WITH NEEDS FAR GREATER THAN JUST THEIR ACADEMICS. ENSURING OUR STUDENTS ARE IN THE BEST MENTAL AND PHYSICAL SPACE THEY CAN BE ONCE THEY ENTER OUR BUILDINGS IS IMPERATIVE. ENSURING THEY HAVE. CLEAN DRINKING WATER THROUGHOUT THE DAY WHILE ON OUR CAMPUSES IS AT THE VERY BASIC LEVEL OF STUDENT NEEDS. MANY OF OUR CAMPUSES UTILIZE PORTABLES TO PROVIDE EDUCATIONAL SPACES FOR STUDENTS WHICH ARE NOT EQUIPPED WITH RUNNING WATER. THIS FORCES STUDENTS TO LEAVE THEIR LEARNING ENVIRONMENT TO MEET THE BASIC NEEDS OF HYDRATION. UNFORTUNATELY ACCESS TO WATER IS NOT ALWAYS AVAILABLE MANY OF OUR DRINKING FOUNTAINS ARE CAPPED OFF INDUSTRY PAYER OR SIMPLY NOT AVAILABLE. WHEN CHILDREN HAVE CONTINUED ACCESS TO WATER THEY'RE ABLE TO FOCUS LISTEN COLLABORATE WITH PEERS RETRAIN RETAIN INFORMATION AND INCREASE ATTENTION SPANS. FOR HYDRATION IS ESSENTIAL SOURCE STUDENTS CAN PROPERLY FUNCTION LEARN AND THRIVE. THIS BILL WILL HAVE A GREAT IMPACT ON STUDENT HEALTH WITHIN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR ALL STUDENTS TO INCLUDE OUR NEEDIEST OF SCHOOLS AND STUDENTS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND I URGE YOUTO SAY I VOTE IN THIS IMPORTANT BILL THANK YOU OTHERS IN SUPPORT MAY COME UP TO THE MICROPHONE STATE YOUR NAME AFFILIATION AND MISSION ON THE BILL ONLY PLEASE.

STACEY FOR PRO PRINCIPLE GARDEN VALLEY ELEMENTARY IN THE TWIN RIVERS SCHOOL DISTRICT AND I URGE YOU HI TO VOTE YES THANK YOU. THANK YOU- ANY OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. A SENIOR OPPOSITION WILL BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE MR MCCARTY IS IT A MINUTE NOW I'M OF THE BILL AND MOVED TO HAVE A SECOND ROW. MISTER BENNETT SECONDS MR YEAH AND THEN YOU KNOW THANK MISTER BLOOM I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN ON THESE ISSUES FROM. YOU KNOW A PUBLIC HEALTH PERSPECTIVE AS WELL AS A YOU KNOW PLASTIC BOTTLE PERSPECTIVE EMBARRASSED SO THEY HAVE A PLASTIC BOTTLE HERE. AND NOT MY HYDRO FLASK HERE. BUT LOOK IF YOU LOOK AT- THE ISSUE OF OBESITY IN KIDS AT SCHOOL IS A BIG FACTOR IN YEARS AGO WE HAD. LITERALLY SODA MACHINES IN SCHOOLS WE HAD COKE WHICH SPONSORED THE FOOTBALL FIELD. GET A LOT. TO REMOVE SUGAR SWEETENED DRINKS FROM THE- SCHOOL SITEWE HAVEN'T ALWAYS BEEN EASY FOR KIDS TO DRINK THE EASIEST AND CHEAPEST AND MOST BENEFICIAL PRODUCT WHICH IS WATER IN SELMA I THINK THIS IS BECAUSE- THAT THE RIGHT BALANCE HERE AND- THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS FOR TEN YEARS MISTER BROWN. THANK MAKE SURE YOU RE USE THAT BOTTLE- BUT THAT WE HAD WE DO HAVE MOTION A SECOND I DON'T BELIEVE THERE'S ANY MORE COMMENTS FROM INTO THE COMMITTEE YOU MAY CLOSE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE THANK THANK YOU MISTER BLOOM MAKE SACRAMENTO CONROE PLEASED. FILE ITEM THIRTEEN AB TWENTY SIX THIRTY EIGHT THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY AND TOXIC MATERIALS COMMITTEE WITH AMENDMENTS TO BE PROCESSED IN THAT COMMITTEE O'DONNELL O'DONNELL I'D DALLY. DALLY I'D BENNETT BENNETT I'D CHEN LI MCCARTY AYE MCCARTY AYE QUIRK-SILVA. QUIRK-SILVA FIVE FIVE OF LAWS FIVE ALSO IS OUT THANK YOU THANK YOU JESSICA. THAT WILL MOVE TO A MISTER CUNNINGHAM WHO IS HERE MR COUNTY HAS AB. TWO ZERO FIVE ONE. TWO ZERO FIVE ONE. MY YES THEY WHEN READING THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I'D LIKE TO START WITH THE HARD THANKS THE CHAIR AND TO THE CA WE'VE BEEN WORK ON THIS FINANCIAL LITERACY PIECE FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND I THINK WE'VE GOT SOMETHING THAT WE CAN BE PROUD OF HERE- AB TWENTY FIFTY ONE DIRECTS THE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATION TO ALLOCATE FUNDING TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS FOR THE PURCHASE OF MATERIALS AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT. MATERIALS NEEDED TO ADMINISTER FINANCIAL LITERACY CLASSES. CALIFORNIA REP AMONG THE WORST STATES IN THE NATION FOR FINANCIAL LITERACY INSTRUCTION IN A RECENT REPORT BY THE CENTER FOR FINANCIAL LITERACY AT CHAMPLAIN COLLEGE IN VERMONT WE ACTUALLY SCORED ENOUGH. CURRENTLY THERE IS NO REQUIREMENT WITHIN OUR CURRICULUM TO COMPLETE FINANCIAL LITERACY COURSE. OR A FINANCIAL LITERACY COURSE IN ORDER TO GRADUATE FROM HIGH SCHOOL NOW. MANY MANY HIGH SCHOOLS I SHOULD NOTE DO INCORPORATE FINANCIAL LITERACY AS PART OF AN ECONOMICS CLASS ARE PART OF A CIVICS CLASS SO THAT IS A GOOD THING- BUT THEY NEED SOME HELP. NEED SOME HELP BECAUSE UNDERSTANDING THE BASICS OF MONEY AND HOW MONEY WORKS INTEREST RATES HOW INTEREST RATES WORK BOTH FOR YOU IN THE INVESTMENT CONTACTS AND AGAINST YOU AND IN THAT CONTEXT UNDERSTANDING HOW TO BALANCE CHECKBOOK UNDERSTAND THE TIME VALUE OF MONEY. UNDERSTANDING CERTAIN BASIC THINGS ABOUT CREDIT AND THE IMPORTANCE OF CREDIT REPORTING IMPORTANT TO MAINTAIN A GOOD CREDIT SCORE TO BUY A HOME OR MONEY TO GO TO SCHOOL AND DO THOSE THINGS. WE ALL WANT OUR KIDS TO STRIVE TO DO- THOSE ARE BASIC LIFE SKILLS IN MY VIEW IT'S SIMILAR TO HEALTH CLASS IN BASIC NUTRITION TO BASE MATHEMATICS TO BE ABLE TO READ WRITE. FACT BILLION. SO FORTH. SO I THINK IT'S REALLY I THINK THIS IS A GOOD. WAY TO DO IT BECAUSE IF WE CAN GET MONEY APPROPRIATED AT WHETHER IT'S THIS YEAR OR IN THE FUTURE YEAR THAN THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS WILL BE INCREASING THE POP THE- INCREASING THE SUPPLY OF FUNDS THAT CAN BE USED. AND IT'S A VERY SMALL INVESTMENT IN TERMS OF DOLLAR TERMS BUT- IN TERMS OF THE WAY CAN CHANGE PEOPLE'S LIVES I CAN TELL. YOU KNOW I. SCHOOL LONG TIME. YEAH YOUR GRADUATE HIGH SCHOOL AND- WITH A LAW SCHOOL I'D I KNOW A LOT OF LAWYERS AND A LOT OF DOCTORS FOR YOU KNOW WE ALL DO. THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE TO GO TO A LOT OF EDUCATE GO THROUGH A LOT OF EDUCATION ARE VERY VERY SUCCESSFUL IN LIFE. THE DON'T KNOW THE FIRST THING ABOUT HOW. TO MANAGE MONEY. AND IT DIDN'T IT DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER YOU'RE MAKING FIFTY THOUSAND A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND BASICS. OF FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT BASICS OF. ALL THE THINGS I MENTIONED EARLIER- HE E. ARE GOING TO HAVE LESS SUCCESS IN LIFE MORE STRESS IN LIFE ANDYOU OTHER WILL. PUT I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING ALL OUR KIDS. IN THE EARLIER WE GET THAT EDUCATION. IN THE SYSTEM THAT EARLIER WE EXPOSE KIDS THESE CONCEPTS- THE BETTER POSITION THEY ARE TO SUCCEED IN LIFE. I WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS TEN RENTS AT A OF NEXT GEN PERSONAL FINANCE. THANK YOU CHAIR MEMBER. THE OPPORTUNITY TESTIFIED TODAY. IS A POPULAR ME. TODAY ARE SOCIAL. GO SOME LIKE THE- THINGS I NEVER LEARNED IN HIGH SCHOOL INCLUDES A LIST OF ITEMS LIKE TAXES BANKING MANAGING MONEY HOW TO INTERVIEW AND IT ENDS WITH THIS THE PERFECT RIAN THEOREM. IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT CLASS YOU NEVER HAD. IT'S A CLASS THAT RESEARCH SHOWS IMPROVES LIVES BY HELPING PEOPLE MANAGE CREDIT HELPING THEM STAY OUT OF THINGS LIKE HIGH INTEREST LOANS HELP THEM MANAGE STUDENT LOANS YOU KNOW STUDENT DEBT IN THIS COUNTRY IS BUT ONE POINT EIGHT TRILLION DOLLARS. AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE DID SOME RESEARCH WE FOUND 88% OF CALIFORNIA VOTERS SAID THEY SHOULD BE A GUARANTEE PART. OF HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION. NOT ONLY DID THEY SAY THAT THAT WAS IMPORTANT HE SAID IT'S URGENT. THAT LEGISLATORS ACT UPON IT. SOME TALK ABOUT HIGH SCHOOL PERSONAL FINANCE COURSES TODAY. ONLY TWENTY FIVE YOU HEARD THAT CALIFORNIA GOT AN F. IN THAT CHAMPLAIN COLLEGE STUDY WE FOUND ONLY 25% OF HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA HAVE ACCESS TO A PERSONAL FINANCE ELECTIVE. TO NOT A GUARANTEE JUST ELECTIVE NATIONWIDE THAT NUMBER 70% SO WE ARE WHEN WE RANK IN OUR ANNUAL STUDY WHEN WE READ CALIFORNIA'S FORTY NINTH AT A FIFTY. AND THE STATE CAN DO BETTER. SO MY NAME IS TIM RAINES I'M CO FOUNDER OF NEXT GEN PERSONAL FINANCE WE'RE CALIFORNIA BASED NONPROFIT WHERE THE LEADER WHEN IT COMES TO PROVIDING CURRICULUM AS WELL AS PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT TO EDUCATORS COOL THING ABOUT OUR BUSINESS MODELS EVERYTHING WE WAS FREE. SO I HAD SOME SUCCESS AS AN ENTREPRENEUR INVESTOR AND I CREATED ENDOWMENT BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN OUR MISSION AS AN ORGANIZATION EVERY STUDENT DESERVES TO TAKE A PERSONAL FINANCE COURSE IN HIGH SCHOOL. WE SHOULDN'T HAVE THEM LEARN FOR THE SCHOOL OF HARD KNOCKS. SO HERE'S AN EXAMPLE WE WORK WITH TEACHERS IN CALIFORNIA OVER THIRTY NINE HUNDRED CURRENTLY USE OUR CURRICULUM SO IT'S HAPPENING. IT'S JUST NOT HAPPENING ENOUGH RIGHT THAT TWO UNITS IN ECONOMICS PROBABLY. YOU'RE NOT ABLE TO GET THROUGH THE MATERIAL YOU SHOULD. BUT THERE ARE SOME AMAZING EDUCATORS IN CALIFORNIA LET ME LET ME POINT OUT ONE HER NAME IS TARA ROS HE- TEACHES AT SAN MARCOS. EXCUSE ME SAN MARCO HIGH SCHOOL ELECTIVE AND SHE THOUGHT YOU KNOW I'M GONNA START ELECTED IN THE FALL IN. WE WILL HAVE ONE SECTION IN TWENTY STUDENTS. YOU KNOW SHE'S ENDING THE YEAR WITH SIX SECTIONS TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY STUDENTS THAT'S THE IN BACK ALL SHE DID WAS SHE LED A SPARK SHE SAID LET'S OFFER ELECTIVE THIS CLASS IS IN DEMAND AND I THINK WE BELIEVE IN THE REASON I'M HERE TO SUPPORT AB TWENTY FIFTY ONE. IS THAT THIS IS GONNA LIGHT MULTIPLE SPARKS ACROSS THE STATE. THANK YOU. CAN JUST CLOSE WITH ONE ONE LAST THING I THINK THIS IS THE GOOD PART SO WHEN AB TWENTY FIFTY ONE PASSES AND IS SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR. WE WILL CONTINUE TO PROVIDE. I'M IN PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT SO I HEARD YOU EARLIER CHAIR DONAL SAY I WISH THERE WAS A SITE THAT I COULD HAVE GONE TO. THAT HAD EVERYTHING. I STARTED MY NONPROFIT EIGHT YEARS AGO TO SOLVE THAT PROBLEM SIXTY ONE THOUSAND TEACHERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY CURRENTLY USE A SO. THERE ISN'T A TON OF EFFORT TO KIND OF GET THE BALL ROLLING IT'S THERE. THIS FREE CURRICULUM AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT WE WILL COMMIT. MY ORGANIZATION AND GPF WILL COMMIT TO MATCHING CALIFORNIA'S INVESTMENT UP TO ONE MILLION DOLLARS. TO ENSURE SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE INVEST IN TEACHERS THAT'S WHERE THE ALUE IS THANK YOU THANK YOU JUST A QUESTION TO SO DO YOU HAVE SUCH A WEBSITE YEAH W. W. W. DOT N. G. P. F. OTHERS IN SUPPORT. IT'S A- BIGGER MEMBERS NOT BRASSY CALIFORNIA SOCIETY OF CPA'S IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU TO OUR MEMBERS CARSON NEED THEM HAVE THE CALIFORNIA CHARTER SCHOOLS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON CHEN MEMBERS AND LEAD ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CREDIT MEAN LIKE IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU TURN MEMBERS BRENDA BASS ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU SEEN OTHERS IN SUPPORT ANY OPPOSITION SEEING OPPOSITION WILL BRING IT BACK ON AGAIN I PUT UP TO SAY WHAT I SAID EARLIER I APPRECIATE THIS EFFORT. AS SOMEONE WHO TEACHES. NO THIS VERY TOPIC IN AN ECONOMICS CLASS SO THE ECONOMIC CURRICULA. STANDARDS ARE NOT THAT WIDE YOU CAN GET THEM DONE AND ABOUT HALF OF THE SEMESTER THEN YOU SPEND. THE REST OF THAT SEMESTER TEACHING TO A LETTER SEEN ACTUALLY PRETTY GOOD JOB. IN THAT TIME FOR YOU DON'T NECESSARILY NEED A STANDALONE CLASS THE PLACE FOR THIS TO GET DONE IS IN. AN ECONOMICS CLASS BUT AGAIN AS I SHARED YOU HIGHLIGHTED I THINK TEACHERS NEED RESOURCES PROBABLY NEED TO BE EDUCATED THEMSELVES- ON THIS TOPIC WHAT HAPPENS YOU BUY STOCKS WHATEVER YOU BUY AN INDEX FUND WHATEVER YOU BUY. YOU KNOW IRAN AND YOU KNOW ROTH IRA TRADITIONAL FOUR THREE BE ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF. INVEST IN PROPERTY ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF HAS TO BE TUCKED IN. AND PEOPLE NEED TOOLS TO TEACH THAT A BASIC UNDERSTANDING OF YOUR HIGHLIGHTED TO- BUT ALSO TOOLS TO TEACH THAT THAT THAT'S REALLY WHAT I WOULD NEED. IN A CLASSROOM IN A WAY THAT ENGAGES STUDENTS NOW NOT JUST YOU KNOW READ YOU GOT A LIMIT. RIGHT SO I APPRECIATE THAT MR BENNETT. THANK YOU FOR MUCH A MISTER CHAIR. ON AFTER SPENDING MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS THE TEACHING OF REQUIRED ECONOMICS COURSE. IN HIGH SCHOOLS. I WOULD JUST OFFER I COMPLETELY AGREE THAT EVERY STUDENT NEEDS. MUCH MORE AND BETTER. FINANCIAL LITERACY. AND THE ECONOMICS COURSES THE PROPER PLACE TO DO IT. I THINK THE CHALLENGE IS. GETTING IT TO HAPPEN IN THE- COMICS COURSE. AND THAT IS WHERE I THINK WE REALLY STILL NEED WORK. AND THAT IS IT SHOULD NOT BE UP TO THE TEACHER. WHETHER THEY ARE GOING TO ARE NOT GOING TO TEACH THE FINANCIAL LITERACY COMPONENTS. THAT ARE SO ESSENTIAL FOR CHILDREN TO BE SUCCESSFUL. AND RIGHT NOW ALL RIGHT FRANKLY THAT IS THE CASE. THERE IS NOT REALLY A WAY FOR US TO ESTABLISH THAT ACCOUNTABILITY. I KNOW SOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS. THAT MMHM MANY TEACHERS ARE RELUCTANT TO TEACH GOVERNMENT AND SO WHAT THEY'VE DONE IS THEY'VE TAKEN THEIR GOVERNMENT AND ECONOMICS ONE SEMESTER REQUIREMENT FOR REACH AND THEY DO SO THREE QUARTERS OF GOVERNMENT AND THEN TRY TO SQUEEZE THE ECONOMICS IN AND ONE QUARTER THEY DO THAT. PLACIDA BUT AND SAY THAT'S THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH AND WE NEED TO FIND A WAY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE ARE READY MANDATE ECONOMICS THAT WAS. THE BATTLE FOUGHT PEOPLE THOUGHT THEY WERE FIGHTING FOR. THIS LITERACY FOR STUDENTS BUT IT IS NOT WHAT MANY TEACHERS HAVE BEEN COMFORTABLE WITH AND SO I THINK WE HAVE AN IMPORTANT TOOL HERE WHICH IS MAKE TEACHERS MORE COMFORTABLE BUT THERE ALSO NEEDS TO BE ACCOUNTABILITY. THAT THAT COMPONENT THE ECONOMICS COURSE IS TAUGHT AND TAUGHT WELL. IT IS. YOUNG PEOPLE FUTURE SO ARE YOU KNOW LITERALLY CAN BE RUINED BY THE TIME THEY'RE TWENTY ONE OR TWENTY TWO. NUMBER ONE. AND IF YOUGET IN THE WRONG HABITS IT IS REALLY HARD TO GET OUT OF THAT HABIT OF- DOING THAT SO THIS ISN'T. A BE ALL A CURE ALL BUT IT IS AN ESSENTIAL FIRST STEP TO GETTING FURTHER ALONG IN SO THAT'S THE CHALLENGE THAT I SEE THAT WE STILL HAVEN'T CALIFORNIA WELCOME THE STAFF. GRADUATING AND CAN. YOU FOR- STEPPING UP- WITH FREE RESOURCES FOR TEACHERS AND STUDENTS AND IF I CAN JUST JUMP IN I THINK I THINK THE VALUE OF THE COURSE IS. THE ISSUE OF ACCOUNTABILITY. BECAUSE IT IS EMBEDDED IN ANOTHER COURSE IN HIS RESEARCH OUT THERE THAT SUGGEST ABOUT HALF THE TIME WHEN IT'S EMBEDDED IN OTHER COURTS IS NOT TAUGHT. RIGHT RIGHT IT MIGHT BE IN THE STANDARDS BUT- MANY TEACHERS ARE COMFORTABLE WITH THE ECONOMICS. SO THAT EACH ECONOMICS AND- THAT'S WHAT WE FIND AGAIN 70% OF KIDS NATIONWIDE. ATTEND SCHOOL THAT HAS AN ELECTIVE 25% CALIFORNIA. I'M GONNA ON BOTH YOU SAY THIS IS AN ADMINISTRATIVE PROBLEM. THIS IS THE DUTY OF A SCHOOL ADMINISTRATOR DISTRICT ADMINISTRATION. TO MAKE SURE SCHOOLS ARE TEACHING WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO TEACH- THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO TEACH US IN THEIR ECONOMICS COURSE. I THINK IT MAY BE THAT PEOPLE AFRAID OF IT BECAUSE MAYBE THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND THEMSELVES AS BEEN HIGHLIGHTED OR MAYBE. THEY DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES. TO DO IT. OR DO YOU HAVE THE RESOURCES ARE THERE. THE RESOURCES ARE THERE HEY YOU YOU TELL ME YOU GOT A WEBSITE. OKAY I'LL BE MORE THAN WEBSITE ON- UNTIL I GET THAT AND I'M GONNA GO LOOK AT THIS WEBSITE. BUT I WOULD SAY FOR ME AS A CLASSROOM TEACHER. I WAS PRETTY MUCH DEVELOPING- I DIDN'T RESOURCES YOU'RE SAYING THIS ABOUT I APPRECIATE THAT'S GREAT I'M GONNA GO TO THAT WEBSITE SO I THINK AND IT MISTER CHAIRMAN COULD I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH YOU ADMINISTRATORS THAT'S THAT THEIR PRIMARY FUNCTION NOT TO BE TO MAKE SURE TEACHERS ARE TEACHING WELL AND TEACHING WITH THEIR ASSIGNED TO IT AND THEN PUT BUT WE ALL KNOW WAY TOO OFTEN TEACHERS ARE COMPLETELY LEFT- ON THAT ISSUE AND THEN TEACHERS STILL HAVE TO MAKE THE PROFESSIONALS OF ALL OF THE PERKS OF ALSO. IT CLEARLY IS BUT IT CLEARLY IS IMPORTANT WE GET THIS DONE BETTER THANK YOU. GREAT WITHOUT ANY FOR THE COMPANY COMMITTEE MEMBERS. ARE YOU DO ACCEPT THAT MANY MOMENTS. YES SORRY AND THE COURTS OKAY THAT- SO WITH THAT SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE YOU CAN CLOSE REAL QUICKLY. I'LL JUST BE VERY BRIEF I THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT STEP BECAUSE- WHETHER IT IS A RESOURCE ISSUE OR WHETHER IT'S INTIMIDATION ISSUE OR WHATEVER IT IS THAT THIS. BILL AND- FUTURE FUNDING WE HOPE TO GET WILL. ENABLE THOSE TEACHERS THAT ARE READY TO DO THIS WITHIN THEIR ECONOMICS CURRICULUM- THE SOME TOOLS TO GO OUT FIGURE OUT HOW TO EFFECTIVELY DO IT AND GET OVER HOPEFULLY. MAYBE THE IMITATION. I'M MATT LIKES ME. RIGHT IN THIS SOME PEOPLE ARE MATH BUT MOST PEOPLE DON'T LIKE MATH. AND YOU KNOW YOU'RE A KID SHOULD COME OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL TODAY KNOWING. IF I GET THROWN A CREDIT CARD WHEN I GO TO COLLEGE AND THEY SAY SIGN UP FOR THIS CREDIT CARD WITH YOUR THREE THOUSAND DOLLAR LIMIT. AND THEN THEY PUT THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS ON A CREDIT CARD A 20% INTEREST AND MAKE MINIMUM PAYMENTS. HOW MUCH THEY ACTUALLY PAID OR BANKING INTERESTS AND HOW LONG IT'S GONNA TAKE THEM TO PAY THE- MOST KIDS I WOULD.

THE COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS ALSO BECAUSE MANY OF OUR SCHOOLS TO USE DIGITAL PLATFORMS TO PROVIDE EDUCATION FURTHER INTEGRATING DIGITAL MEDIA INTO OUR EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM. OUTSIDE THE CLASSROOM THE USE OF DIGITAL MEDIA HAS BECOME EXTREMELY WIDESPREAD AND SO IN TURN HAVE THE POTENTIAL PITFALLS WE HAD A INFORMATIONAL HEARING- SEVERAL WEEKS AGO WHERE I WAS. AMAZED TO LEARN THAT- POST PANDEMIC TEENAGERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ARE SPENDING CLOSE TO EIGHT HOURS A DAY ONLINE SO ONE THIRD OF THEIR DAY ONLINE. A RECENT STUDY FOUND THAT 59% OF TEENS HAVE EXPERIENCED CYBER BILLING AND ONLINE HARASSMENT. THERE ARE OTHER CONCERNS OF NEGATIVE IMPACTS OF DIGITAL MEDIA ON BODY IMAGE MENTAL HEALTH.

AS A RESULT OF THESE EFFORTS MANY KIDS AND TEENS ARE NOW ON. AND WILL BE CONNECTED TO THE VAST INTERNET- THIS IS GIVING MANY YOUNG PEOPLE ACCESS TO EXPLORE CONNECT CREATE AND LEARN WAYS NEVER BEFORE IMAGINED. UNFORTUNATELY ACCESS HAS COME WITHOUT A SAFE OPERATING MANUAL- WITH THIS VAST POWER AND ACCESS COME ETHICAL DILEMMAS DILEMMAS CHALLENGES AND- OTHER THINGS THAT MUST BE MANAGED INCLUDING. BULLYING HATE SPEECH. IT IS TO MISINFORMATION PRIVACY VIOLATIONS TECH ADDICTION AND OTHER I'M SURE YOU CAN IMAGINE ALL THE OTHER ISSUES- THESE ISSUES ARE INCREASINGLY FACED IN BOTH SCHOOLS AND AT HOME. AS A RESULT EDUCATORS AND PARENTS ARE STRUGGLING WITH HOW TO MAKE SENSE OF THIS NEW WORLD AND HOW TO EMPOWER KIDS.
