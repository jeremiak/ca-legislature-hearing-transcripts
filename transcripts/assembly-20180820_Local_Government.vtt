00:17:56.676 --> 00:18:00.279 region:rollup2
CENTRALIZED FUNDING MECHANISM SO

00:17:58.744 --> 00:18:01.681 region:rollup2

EMERGENCY SHELTERS THERE IS A

00:18:06.852 --> 00:18:10.289 region:rollup2
FUNDING GAP THIS WILL HELP TO

00:18:09.155 --> 00:18:11.490 region:rollup2
CLOSE THAT GAP SIMPLICITY

00:18:10.289 --> 00:18:14.260 region:rollup2
HOUSING ENTITLED.

00:18:11.490 --> 00:18:16.062 region:rollup2
PROJECT BUT IS SHORT SOME LEVEL

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:17.597 region:rollup2
OF FUNDING THAN THEY CAN APPLY

00:18:16.062 --> 00:18:18.798 region:rollup2
TO THE JPA AND IF IT MEETS ALL

00:18:17.597 --> 00:18:19.899 region:rollup2
THE PARAMETERS.

00:18:18.798 --> 00:18:22.668 region:rollup2
THEN THEY COULD SEEK THAT

00:18:19.899 --> 00:18:24.270 region:rollup2
FUNDING IT WILL.

00:18:22.668 --> 00:18:26.005 region:rollup2
IT'S LIMITED GENERAL FUND

SERVICES THAT COULD COME TO HEAR

00:18:27.873 --> 00:18:30.409 region:rollup2
IT WILL ALSO CREATE THAT

00:18:29.041 --> 00:18:32.111 region:rollup2
CENTRALIZE FUNDING POOL WERE

00:18:30.409 --> 00:18:33.446 region:rollup2
PRIVATE SECTOR INTERESTS CAN PUT

GOING TO CONSTRUCTIVE PROJECTS.

00:18:35.715 --> 00:18:37.850 region:rollup2

GRACIOUSLY MADE AVAILABLE OVER

00:19:03.943 --> 00:19:06.045 region:rollup2
THE LAST FEW YEARS.

00:19:05.111 --> 00:19:08.080 region:rollup2
PACIFIC EARLY ANSWER YOUR

00:19:06.045 --> 00:19:10.449 region:rollup2
QUESTION REGARDING BONDING IF IN

00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:12.651 region:rollup2
THE FUTURE THE COUNTY OR ANOTHER

00:19:10.449 --> 00:19:14.186 region:rollup2
CD WANTED TO CONTRACT A CERTAIN

00:19:12.651 --> 00:19:15.421 region:rollup2
AMOUNT OF DOLLARS OVER A CERTAIN

00:19:14.186 --> 00:19:17.390 region:rollup2
AMOUNT OF YEARS.

00:19:15.421 --> 00:19:18.691 region:rollup2
WE WANTED TO SET UP THE GP TO BE

00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:20.493 region:rollup2
ABLE TO MAKE THOSE BARNABA

00:19:18.691 --> 00:19:20.826 region:rollup2
DOLLARS HOWEVER WHERE OVER IN

00:19:20.493 --> 00:19:22.094 region:rollup2
THE SENATE --

00:19:20.826 --> 00:19:23.596 region:rollup2
THEY HAD VERY SIMILAR QUESTIONS

00:19:22.094 --> 00:19:25.865 region:rollup2
AND WE CLEANED UP THAT LANGUAGE

00:19:23.596 --> 00:19:27.133 region:rollup2
TIGHTLY FROM A PREVIOUS VERSION

00:19:25.865 --> 00:19:29.068 region:rollup2
TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE DOLLARS

00:19:27.133 --> 00:19:30.369 region:rollup2
ARE CONNECTED WE CAN'T JUST BOND

00:19:29.068 --> 00:19:33.439 region:rollup2
AGAINST NOTHING LAW AND THERE

00:19:30.369 --> 00:19:36.042 region:rollup2
HAS TO BE A STRONG FINANCE DREAM

00:19:33.439 --> 00:19:38.577 region:rollup2
WE'D BE ABLE TO PROVE --

00:19:36.042 --> 00:19:40.646 region:rollup2
ALSO SOLD MAYBE AS ARE THE BUT I

00:19:38.577 --> 00:19:42.248 region:rollup2
JUST THINK AS A BUSINESS PERSON.

00:19:40.646 --> 00:19:42.848 region:rollup2
INVESTING IN THAT.

00:19:42.248 --> 00:19:45.818 region:rollup2
WOULD THEY BE ABLE TO GET HOME

00:19:42.848 --> 00:19:49.288 region:rollup2
--

00:19:45.818 --> 00:19:51.957 region:rollup2
TAX BENEFITS HOME ANY CALL OF

00:19:49.288 --> 00:19:53.726 region:rollup2
THE IRS POSSIBLY YEAH.

00:19:51.957 --> 00:19:54.360 region:rollup2
POSSIBLY BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE A

00:19:53.726 --> 00:19:56.162 region:rollup2
GOOD INCENTIVE FOR THEM TO DO IT

00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:56.962 region:rollup2
--

00:19:56.162 --> 00:19:59.365 region:rollup2
THE OTHER QUESTION IS THE

00:19:56.962 --> 00:20:01.901 region:rollup2
SUPPORT OF PART OF THE HOUSING

00:19:59.365 --> 00:20:03.102 region:rollup2
WHICH IS REALLY IMPORTANT --

00:20:01.901 --> 00:20:05.504 region:rollup2
HOW WOULD THAT WOULD THAT BE

00:20:03.102 --> 00:20:06.072 region:rollup2
WRAPAROUND SERVICES IN A HOW IS

00:20:05.504 --> 00:20:07.206 region:rollup2
THAT FUNDED THROUGH THE SAME

00:20:06.072 --> 00:20:08.607 region:rollup2
BOND?

00:20:07.206 --> 00:20:10.309 region:rollup2
ARE AS AN OPERATIONAL BOND OR IS

00:20:08.607 --> 00:20:11.877 region:rollup2
IT.

00:20:10.309 --> 00:20:13.679 region:rollup2
A DIFFERENT POT OF MONEY A LEAD

00:20:11.877 --> 00:20:17.216 region:rollup2
KELSEY WHO DID MOST OF THE SITE

00:20:13.679 --> 00:20:18.417 region:rollup2
I WORK ON THE ANSWER.

00:20:17.216 --> 00:20:20.619 region:rollup2
JUST THAT IT IT WOULDN'T ALL BE

00:20:18.417 --> 00:20:21.187 region:rollup2
BOND FINANCING THE MANY CASES WE

00:20:20.619 --> 00:20:22.588 region:rollup2
HAVE FUNNY THAT SEE THERE'S

00:20:21.187 --> 00:20:24.323 region:rollup2
LOCAL STATE OR FEDERAL AND

00:20:22.588 --> 00:20:25.825 region:rollup2
THERE'S JUST A GAP THAT'S NOT A

00:20:24.323 --> 00:20:27.393 region:rollup2
100% THERE THIS WILL BE A PLACE

00:20:25.825 --> 00:20:29.829 region:rollup2
WHERE THE COUNTY CAN PULL.

00:20:27.393 --> 00:20:31.130 region:rollup2
ALL OF ITS RESOURCES AND I CAN'T

00:20:29.829 --> 00:20:33.799 region:rollup2
TELL YOU HOW MANY --

00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:35.401 region:rollup2
WEALTHY INDIVIDUALS IN TO GIVE

00:20:33.799 --> 00:20:36.836 region:rollup2
TO THIS AS WELL WANT TO GIVE TO

00:20:35.401 --> 00:20:38.070 region:rollup2
HELP CREATE.

00:20:36.836 --> 00:20:38.704 region:rollup2
A SOLUTION FOR PARENTS SUPPORT

00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:39.371 region:rollup2
HOUSING THEY JUST DON'T KNOW

00:20:38.704 --> 00:20:41.207 region:rollup2
WHERE THEY CAN GIVE THE DOLLARS

00:20:39.371 --> 00:20:42.241 region:rollup2
AND BE ASSURED THAT PROJECT WILL

00:20:41.207 --> 00:20:43.676 region:rollup2
DEVELOP AND SO.

00:20:42.241 --> 00:20:45.444 region:rollup2
IT WILL ALLOW US TO CAPTURE ALL

00:20:43.676 --> 00:20:47.680 region:rollup2
THOSE CABINET COUNTING A PRIVATE

00:20:45.444 --> 00:20:49.882 region:rollup2
CAPITAL DOLLARS AS WELL --

00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:51.917 region:rollup2
BUT THAT BEING SAID IT IT'S IT

00:20:49.882 --> 00:20:53.652 region:rollup2
IT PROVIDES BASICALLY A MENU OF

00:20:51.917 --> 00:20:54.987 region:rollup2
OPTIONS FOR CITIES TO PULL FROM

00:20:53.652 --> 00:20:56.155 region:rollup2
TO CREATE THESE PROJECTS BUT

00:20:54.987 --> 00:20:58.057 region:rollup2
THERE IS AN ONGOING EFFORT

00:20:56.155 --> 00:20:58.691 region:rollup2
BETWEEN ACC OF SEEING THE COUNTY

00:20:58.057 --> 00:21:00.659 region:rollup2
OF ORANGE TO ALSO MAKE SURE THAT

00:20:58.691 --> 00:21:02.328 region:rollup2
--

00:21:00.659 --> 00:21:02.995 region:rollup2
THAT THOSE TWENTY SEVEN HUNDRED

00:21:02.328 --> 00:21:04.897 region:rollup2
PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING IS

00:21:02.995 --> 00:21:05.698 region:rollup2
WE'VE HOUSING UNITS THAT WE'VE

00:21:04.897 --> 00:21:06.599 region:rollup2
IDENTIFIED THAT ARE NEEDED IN

00:21:05.698 --> 00:21:08.267 region:rollup2
ORANGE COUNTY.

00:21:06.599 --> 00:21:09.935 region:rollup2
ARE ALLOCATED IN A WAY THAT IS

00:21:08.267 --> 00:21:11.937 region:rollup2
TRULY DISPERSED ACROSS THE

00:21:09.935 --> 00:21:13.172 region:rollup2
COUNTY AND SO EVERY CITY HAS

00:21:11.937 --> 00:21:14.774 region:rollup2
BEEN WORKING WITH A C. CO SEE TO

00:21:13.172 --> 00:21:16.575 region:rollup2
PUT FOR THE NUMBER OF UNITS THEY

00:21:14.774 --> 00:21:17.977 region:rollup2
WILL COMMIT. TO BUILDING BUT WE

00:21:16.575 --> 00:21:19.345 region:rollup2
STILL HAVE A FUNDING GAP THAT

00:21:17.977 --> 00:21:21.514 region:rollup2
MANY CITIES ARE FACING

00:21:19.345 --> 00:21:23.082 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR SMALLER CITIES AND SO

00:21:21.514 --> 00:21:24.717 region:rollup2
THIS IS THAT POOL OF FUNDING

00:21:23.082 --> 00:21:25.918 region:rollup2
WITH VACANT APPEAL AND AND AND

00:21:24.717 --> 00:21:27.086 region:rollup2
GET THAT ASSISTANCE AND THEN THE

00:21:25.918 --> 00:21:27.620 region:rollup2
ONLY THING THAT I WOULD ADD TO

00:21:27.086 --> 00:21:28.621 region:rollup2
THAT SPECIFICALLY ON THE

00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:30.489 region:rollup2
SERVICES.

00:21:28.621 --> 00:21:31.657 region:rollup2
YOU WILL NOTICE AND THE LANGUAGE

00:21:30.489 --> 00:21:33.659 region:rollup2
THERE ARE NO REFERENCES TO

00:21:31.657 --> 00:21:34.360 region:rollup2
SERVICES NOT BECAUSE A BEFORE

00:21:33.659 --> 00:21:35.828 region:rollup2
FOUR EIGHT IS ALL ABOUT THE

00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:36.929 region:rollup2
CAPITAL CONSTRUCTION THE

00:21:35.828 --> 00:21:38.464 region:rollup2
PHYSICAL CONSTRUCTION A

00:21:36.929 --> 00:21:39.832 region:rollup2
PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING.

00:21:38.464 --> 00:21:41.433 region:rollup2
HOWEVER PERMITS PART OF HOUSING

00:21:39.832 --> 00:21:43.169 region:rollup2
DOES NOT WORK AND MUST

00:21:41.433 --> 00:21:45.504 region:rollup2
WRAPAROUND SERVICES ARE PRESENT.

00:21:43.169 --> 00:21:46.839 region:rollup2
AND SO OUR VISION FOR A BEFORE

00:21:45.504 --> 00:21:48.140 region:rollup2
FOR A IN THE HOUSING TRUST IS

00:21:46.839 --> 00:21:49.542 region:rollup2
THAT THOSE SERVICES WILL STILL

00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:50.843 region:rollup2
RESIDE WITH THE COUNTY THAT IS

00:21:49.542 --> 00:21:52.678 region:rollup2
THE COUNTIES CONSTITUTIONAL

00:21:50.843 --> 00:21:54.313 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITY IS TO PROVIDE

ACUTELY POINTED OUT.

00:21:58.417 --> 00:22:01.220 region:rollup2
THE PROBLEM IS THE CITIES DON'T

HAVE THE FUNDING TO CLOSE THOSE

00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:05.591 region:rollup2
GAPS AB FOUR FOUR EIGHT IS ABOUT

00:28:56.568 --> 00:28:59.638 region:rollup2
TRANSPORTATION PURPOSES AND

MEMBERS WE KNOW THERE'S NO

00:28:59.638 --> 00:29:02.841 region:rollup2
GUARANTEE OF THAT.

00:29:01.173 --> 00:29:04.076 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THERE'S NO GUARANTEE

00:29:02.841 --> 00:29:06.011 region:rollup2
THAT THIS MEASURE AUTHORIZES A

00:29:04.076 --> 00:29:06.612 region:rollup2
SPECIAL TAX.

00:29:06.011 --> 00:29:08.246 region:rollup2
IT COULD AUTHORIZE THE GENERAL

00:29:06.612 --> 00:29:09.581 region:rollup2

00:29:08.246 --> 00:29:11.850 region:rollup2
OUR CONCERN WITH THESE TAX

00:29:09.581 --> 00:29:13.118 region:rollup2
AUTHORIZATIONS AS REUBEN CONCERN

00:29:11.850 --> 00:29:13.752 region:rollup2
WITH THEM FOR A NUMBER YEARS

00:29:13.118 --> 00:29:15.420 region:rollup2
IT'S THAT THE MONEY IS SIMPLY

00:29:13.752 --> 00:29:16.989 region:rollup2
GOING TO GO TO UNFUNDED PENSION

00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:17.990 region:rollup2
LIABILITIES.

00:29:16.989 --> 00:29:19.625 region:rollup2
THE CITY OF BERKELEY CURRENTLY

00:29:17.990 --> 00:29:21.960 region:rollup2

00:29:19.625 --> 00:29:23.362 region:rollup2

OF UNFUNDED PENSION LIABILITIES

00:29:26.498 --> 00:29:29.901 region:rollup2
IF IT'S A GENERAL TAX NOTHING

00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:32.638 region:rollup2
PROHIBITS THE MONEY FROM BEING

00:29:29.901 --> 00:29:34.473 region:rollup2
USED FOR THOSE PURPOSES --

00:29:32.638 --> 00:29:36.642 region:rollup2

WE ASK FOR NO VOTE.

00:29:40.245 --> 00:29:43.815 region:rollup2
