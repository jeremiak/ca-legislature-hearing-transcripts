SUBCOMMITTEE FOR AUSTIN ADMINISTRATION. THEY WILL DISCUSS THE BUDGET THE PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT RELATIONS BOARD. EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT. PROMINENT US RELATIONS IN THE CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD. SIMILAR LAST WEEK THE PLANS HERE ALL ITEMS ON THE AGENDA. AND VOTE ON THESE ITEMS LATE IN THE BUDGET SEASON. RIGHT NOW WE A QUORUM SO START OFF AS A SUBCOMMITTEE. HE MOVED TO ITEM NUMBER ONE. PUBLIC EMPLOYEES WRITTEN NATION'S BOARD BUDGET OVERVIEW GOOD AFTERNOON. MY NAME IS MARK GERAGOS AND I'M THE CHAIR OF UPPER. I'M JOINED TODAY ON MY RIGHT WITH FELIX UP BY FELIX DILATORY OUR GENERAL COUNSEL ON MY LEFT MARIAN AGUAYO WHO IS OUR. CHIEF ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICER WE'RE HERE TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS ABOUT. PURPOSE BUDGET. I KNOW IN YOUR AGENDA PACKET THERE WERE SEVERAL QUESTIONS AND. I. DEFERRED TO THE CHAIR IN TERMS OF HOW YOU LIKE IT'S TO PROCEED THAT WOULD BE GOOD IF YOU ASK THE QUESTIONS OKAY SOUNDS GOOD SO LET ME LET ME START AND I'LL GIVE KIND OF A QUICK OVERVIEW AND THEN WOULD ASK MY. COLLEAGUES TO. TO. ADDRESS OF THINGS THAT I MIGHT LEAVE OUT. OF FIRST FOR THE CURRENT BACKLOG OF CASES IN PER INCLUDED IN YOUR AGENDA PACKET WORK TO GRAPHS THAT THE. THAT REALLY LOOKED AT STAFFING OF VACANCIES WITHIN THE OFFICE OF THE GENERAL COUNSEL. AND WHAT I'M CALLING SOME PRODUCTIVITY INDICATORS IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER OF CASES CLOSE THE. AGE OF CASES ON THE ON. FACING THE. GENERAL COUNSEL'S OFFICE. AS WELL AS THE NUMBER OF DAYS THAT IT TOOK IN ORDER TO PROCESS A CASE IN KIND OF GRAPH THAT AGAINST THE VACANCIES. AND WE WERE RUNNING AT WE HAD SOME VACANCIES. AND NOW WE'RE PRETTY MUCH STAFFED UP. AND SO. WERE KIND OF REACHING A BASELINE IN TERMS OF PRODUCTIVITY WITH OUR EXISTING RESOURCES THE AVERAGE AGE OF CASES THAT ARE FACING. THE OFFICE OF THE GENERAL COUNSEL'S ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY DAYS. WE ARE CLOSING IN A IN A QUARTER ROUGHLY TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE CASES. AND THE NUMBER OF PENDING CASES ARE AT THE GENERAL COUNSEL'S OFFICE IS RUNNING SLIGHTLY OVER FIVE HUNDRED CASES. AND I SAY THAT'S OUR BASELINE AS THAT'S WHAT WERE. UP PRODUCING BASED ON THE. GIVEN RESOURCES THAT ARE ALLOCATED I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT THAT. MY THE STATISTICS REFERRED TO THE UP SENIOR THE UNFAIR PRACTICE CHARGES WHICH IS ABOUT SEVENTY PERCENT OF THE WORK THAT'S FACING GENERAL COUNSEL'S OFFICE. SO THAT'S SO THAT'S WHERE WE ARE IN TERMS OF. OUR GENERAL COUNSEL'S OFFICE A CASES THAT ARE PROCESS THE GENERAL COUNSEL'S OFFICE AND A POTENTIAL YOUR APPEAL TO THE OFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR OF A POLICY REAL QUICK IT'S WOULD ESTABLISH A QUORUM SURE. WE'VE LOCAL POLICE COOPER HERE OBERNOLTE HERE. CHIU HERE CHOI. THEY WE WITH WARM PLEASE PROCEED. CASES THAT ARE. SCHEDULED FOR HEARING NOT OF THE GENERAL COUNSEL'S OFFICE THEN GO TO THE OFFICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW. AND THE PRODUCTIVITY OF ADMINISTRATIVE. OFFICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW IS PRETTY CONSISTENT WITH WHAT IT HAS BEEN THERE RUNNING ABOUT BETWEEN A HUNDRED A HUNDRED AND. A HUNDRED AND TEN CASES AND THAT'S KIND OF KIND OF THE BASELINE. THE NEXT STOP IN THE JOURNEY. THROUGH OUR OUR ORGANIZATION PER POTENTIALLY IS AT THE BOARD LEVEL. THE BOARD HAS HAD. THREE THREE MEMBERS ON THE BOARD. AND RECENTLY THE GOVERNOR. HAS APPOINTED A FULL BOARD SO WE WILL HAVE FIVE BOARD MEMBERS. AS OF APRIL NINTH WERE GOING TO HAVE OUR FIFTH BOARD MEMBER AND THAT'LL BE THE FIRST ON THE BOARDS IN FULL AND HOW LONG. YEAH FEBRUARY FEBRUARY TWENTY TWENTY SIXTEEN SO IT'S BEEN A IT'S BEEN A COUPLE OF YEARS JUST SO YOU CAN. GET AN IDEA OF THE THE BOARDS DOCKET RIGHT NOW WITH THREE BOARD MEMBERS. IT'S CURRENTLY EIGHTY ONE CASES SO CURRENTLY EIGHTY ONE APPEAL CASES ARE FACING THE BOARD THAT'S APPROACHING AN ALL TIME HIGH OF NINETY CASES THAT WE HAD IN MARCH OF TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR. WHEN WE LAST HAD. FIVE BOARD MEMBERS THE BOARD STOCK IT WAS CONSIDERABLY SMALLER IT WAS SIXTY OF ON THE ONE THE BOARD STOCKETT. SO THAT'S REALLY KIND OF A QUICK SUMMARY OF. THAT PRODUCTIVITY OF. ISSUES AND THE STATUS OF FAR CASES THAT ARE FACING THE BOARD AT AT ALL LEVELS. ANYTHING TO ADD. MARION. SO THE THE THE THE NEXT QUESTION WAS. RELATED TO BUDGET TRANSPARENCY SHOWS THAT THERE WERE FUNDING OF FOUR FOUR POINT FOUR POSITIONS WERE BEING USED IN OTHER PLACES WITHIN THE BUDGET. THAT REALLY IS SALARY SAVINGS WE WERE GENERATING A LOT OF SALARY SAVINGS A BECAUSE OF THE BOARD VACANCIES PRIMARILY AND WE WERE INVESTING THAT I IN. OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF PER PART OF THAT WAS USED TO REPLACE OUR. I THINK IT WAS NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE OUR CASEMENT WHICH WAS A GOOD YEAR A. THE CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM THAT I BELIEVE WAS IMPLEMENTED THE IN THE SEVENTIES WHO IS BEING REPLACED. THROUGH SOME OF THE SALARY SAVINGS THAT WE'RE ABLE TO GENERATE IN ADDITION SOME COST OVERRUNS WITH THE RELOCATION OF OUR ALLEY OFFICE HAVE BEEN FUNDED THROUGH THOSE SALARY SAVINGS. AND IN ADDITION WE WERE LOOKING AT WAYS IN TERMS OF. INCREASING STAFFING ON A TEMPORARY BASIS IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THE BACKLOG. AND THAT'S WHAT WE'VE BEEN. DOING. WITH THE WITH THE SALARY SAVINGS. ANY COMMENTS OR ADDITIONS. THE NEXT QUESTION RELATED TO. THE GOVERNOR APPOINTING THREE ADDITIONAL MEMBERS TO THE BOARD HOW WILL THIS AFFECT THE BUDGET I THINK THAT'S A CLASSIC GOOD NEWS BAD NEWS SITUATION. THE GOOD NEWS IS FIVE BOARD MEMBERS WRITING DECISIONS ALONG WITH LEGAL STAFF IS GOING TO INCREASE THE BOARDS PRODUCTIVITY SO IS GOING TO BE. IT WILL BE ABLE TO CHIP AWAY AT THE BACKLOG OF CASES THAT ARE THAT THE APPOINTMENT OF THOSE BOARD MEMBERS IS GOING TO DRY UP THE SALARY SAVINGS THAT WE WERE. A ONE TIME MONEY THAT WE WERE USING TO INVEST IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE. INFRASTRUCTURE FOR PER. TO. INCREASE OUR PRODUCTIVITY. AND. THE A AND AND WE'RE ALSO LOOKING TO USE IT FOR EMPLOYEE RETENTION WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT TURN OVER. A OF PURPOSE STAFF AS THEY LOOK FOR PROMOTIONAL OPPORTUNITIES. WITH OTHER DEPARTMENTS AND WE WOULD LIKE TO RETAIN. DOES IT INDIVIDUALS AND WE'VE ALSO USED SOME OF THAT SALARY SAVINGS. WERE INTENDED TO BE DEVOTED TO THAT PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE FINAL QUESTION THAT'S ON YOUR AGENDA HAS TO DO WITH. THE TWO PIECES OF LEGISLATION THAT WERE ENACTED LAST YEAR AND THE QUESTION IS WHAT IMPACT IS THAT HAD. ON PURPOSE WORKLOAD. AT THIS PARTICULAR POINT IT HASN'T BEEN A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN WORKLOAD. ONLY TIME WILL TELL. NOW IT COULD HAVE AN INCREASED IMPACT AWARD COULD ACTUALLY BE LESS THAN THEM. MODEST AMOUNT THAT WE'VE. EXPERIENCED. THUS FAR. SO WITH THAT THAT KINDA CONCLUDES ARE PREPARED RESPONSES BEAT DELIGHTED TO HAVE RESPONDED TO QUESTIONS SIR THANK YOU. S. THIS FARCE RETENTION GOALS WORRISOME YOUR CHALLENGES. THE THE THE THE. THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE IS RETAINING A HIGH POWER OF SEASONED REGIONAL ATTORNEYS. THE PROMOTIONAL OPPORTUNITIES WITHIN PROBE ARE LIMITED. AND. SOME OF OUR REGIONAL ATTORNEYS WHO LOVE THE WORKING FOR PER. ARE SEEK PROMOTIONAL OPPORTUNITY AND ARE TRANSFERRING. TO OTHER STATE DEPARTMENTS SO THEY'RE STAYING WITHIN THIS STATE SYSTEM. WHICH IS A GOOD THING BECAUSE WERE ROOF RETAINING A LOT OF EXCELLENT TALENT BUT THE. THE UNFORTUNATE THING IS THAT'S NOT WITH PER. AND WE'D LIKE TO ADDRESS THAT BECAUSE THE THE ARE ANALYSIS INDICATES THAT. THE MORE EXPERIENCE ATTORNEYS ARE ACTUALLY TURNING OUT A HIGHER NUMBER OF CASES THEN THE. AND. THEN THE NEW ATTORNEYS. AND WE'D LIKE TO RETAIN THAT INCREASE PRODUCTIVITY IN THE SENIOR ATTORNEYS THE ATTORNEYS ARE TRANSFERRING EARLY TRANSFER INTO HIGHER PAYING JOBS YES BILLS FROM THE STATE YES I I IT AND. NOT ONLY HIGH HIGHER PAYING JOBS WITH SUMMER LATERALLY IN INTO LARGER AGENCIES TO. OF FROM A STRATEGIC STANDPOINT IN ORDER TO. OPEN UP OTHER PROMOTIONAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR. SO YOU NEED MORE MONEY. IF THAT'S A. AND. IT IS. WELL YOU KNOW I THAT I THINK IS AS I DESCRIBED OUR OUR BASELINE IS OUR BASELINE I MEAN THE THE THE NUMBER OF CASES THAT. IT'S TAKEN US A HUNDRED AND FIFTY DAYS AT THE GENERAL COUNSEL'S OFFICE IN ORDER TO CLEAR OUT CASES AND WE'VE GOT. A BACKLOG OF OVER FIVE HUNDRED CASES. AND THAT'S WHAT WERE EAM AND WE'RE WORKING VERY HARD AND SO THAT'S THE BASELINE THAT WE WOULD EXPECT WITH EXISTING RESOURCES. IF WE GOT MORE RESOURCES. WE'D BE ABLE TO CHIP AWAY AT. SOME OF THOSE BACKLOGS. OKAY ELLIOTT. FINANCE. ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE. OKAY WHICH OBERNOLTE. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SO HARD YOU KNOW GIVEN THE BACKLOG OF CASES AND GIVEN THE FACT THAT SEVERAL BILLS LAST YEAR THAT WERE SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR. CREATE EVEN MORE ADDITIONAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOU IF IF YOU NEED MORE MONEY FOR. FURTHER AIR I HEAD COUNT AND TRAINING WHY HAVE YOU NOT COME FORWARD WITH THE BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL TO ASK FOR THAT MONEY. YES. NPR THE TWO PROPOSALS THAT CAME ACROSS LAST YEAR WEREN'T. UP PROPOSALS THAT PRODUCED A LOT OF EXTRA WORK TO WORK WERE TALKING ABOUT HAS BEEN PRE EXISTING WHAT WE'VE HAD THESE BACKLOG PROBLEMS NOW SINCE I'VE ARRIVED IN TWENTY FIFTEEN. AND THEY'VE BEEN THE FOCUS OF WHAT WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO DO THROUGH VARIOUS INITIATIVES BUT THE TO PROPOSAL YOU'RE SPEAKING OF THE PCC IN THE ORIENTATION BILL. THEMSELVES ROB ONLY INCREASED A WORKER VERY MARGINALLY. OKAY SO I THINK WE WOULD ALL BE UNIFIED OUR OPINION THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO GET THE BACKLOG REDUCED. SO HOW DO WE GO ABOUT DOING THAT. WELL I THINK WE'RE GONNA BE WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE IN FIGURE OUT PAYS A ARE A WAY OF ON STRUCTURING PURPOSE SO THAT WE ARE ABLE TO RETAIN OUR ATTORNEYS. BE MORE EFFICIENT IN FACT I'M AM IN MARKET SPEAK MORE TO THIS BUT THE BOARD ITSELF HAS. INITIATED A CASE PROCESSING IT INITIATIVE INITIATIVE THAT'S LOOKING AT WAYS TO IMPROVE OUR CASE PROCESSING THROUGH OTHER WAYS. THAT DON'T REQUIRE THE BCP BUT. WHERE WHERE DEFERENCE FLORENTIUS OPTIONS? OKAY LET'S BUT HERE I MEAN WE WANT TO BE YOUR PARTNERS IN GETTING THAT BACK LOAD REDUCED AND OBVIOUSLY. IF WE CAN DO THAT WITHOUT COMMITTING ADDITIONAL STATE RESOURCES THERE THAT THAT EVERYBODY WINS BUT. IF WE TRY AND WE FAIL THEM YOU KNOW REALLY WE EVERYBODY HAS LOST SO YOU KNOW WHAT US KNOW HOW WE CAN BE YOUR PARTNERS INTO IT. YEAH I THINK JUST COUPLE WORDS ON THE CASE PROCESS INITIATIVE THE BOARD DID GO THROUGH A VERY EXTENSIVE PROCESS MEETING WITH OUR CONSTITUENTS AND EMPLOYEES AND CAME UP WITH A REPORT THAT INCLUDED A NUMBER OF. ITEMS THAT. POTENTIALLY COULD IMPROVE THE PROCESSING OF. OF OF CASES THAT A REPORT IS. ON OUR WEBSITE. AVAILABLE. TO MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC AND WILL BE THE SUBJECT OF MEETINGS PUBLIC MEETINGS OF THE BOARD TOMORROW AND THURSDAY DOWN IN LA. WHERE WE'RE GOING TO TAKE TESTIMONY FROM OUR CONSTITUENTS IN TERMS OF WHICH OF THOSE HAS PRIORITIES SO? YOU KNOW THAT'S THAT'S AN IMPORTANT PART. ARE ALTHOUGH THE. THOSE SUGGESTIONS EVEN OF ALL OF THEM ARE IMPLEMENTED WOULD NOT REALLY APPRECIABLY ADDRESS. THE THEIR APPROACH CASE BACKLOG. ALRIGHT WELL I WANT TO BE OPTIMISTIC BUT GIVEN THE HISTORY OF THE BACKLOG IT'S HARD TO BE OPTIMISTIC AND I JUST HOPE WE GET TO A PLACE WHERE WE CAN GET THAT BACKLOG REDUCED. THANK YOU MISTER THANK YOU SO YOU HEALTH FIND NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES NOW OBVIOUSLY IF YOU. TRY AND WORKS OF THINGS AROUND US IN RESULT STILL THE SAME. YOU'RE LIMITED AND THEN YOU MADE UP YOU MADE OUT PUT IN FOR OR ASK FOR ANY BCP'S BUT. I GUESS MY QUESTION HAVE YOU MADE REQUEST INTERNAL IN. OBVIOUSLY MENTAL NOT TO PUT HIM FOR THOSE REQUEST FORWARD. WISHED IS KNOWING HOW STATE WORKS IT HAS AS ITS FIELD SAID WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IN ORDER TO ADDRESS OPERATIONAL ISSUES BUT AT HAVE YOU ASKED. FOR ADDITIONAL POSITIONS. NOT TO BE CP'S AND THAT'S MY QUESTION TO YOU LIVE IN A FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IS AWARE OF OUR STAFFING THAT MEAN WE ARE LABOR INTENSIVE ORGANIZATION THE MORE STAFF WE HAVE THE. MORE CASES THAT WE CAN AND WE'RE WORKING WITH FINANCE IN ORDER TO ADDRESS HOUSE A GREAT. WALK AROUND TOPIC THAT AS A YES. YEAH THAT'S THAT'S THE SAD PART ABOUT IT IS QUITE OFTEN IS AGENCIES THEY'RE ASKING FOR ADDITIONAL BODIES ARE RESOURCES AND. NO SON NEEDED SOME NOT NEEDED BUTTON THERE TOLD HER YOU CAN'T PUT A MAN SO I'M VERY FAMILIAR WITH THAT IN THE WAY THE CITY WORKS WHICH. SEEMS KINDA CONTRARY BUT ANYWAY THE WHOLE AND OPEN UP PUBLIC COMMENT. IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK ON THIS ISSUE. ALONG WITH CASTRO FIRM. TO CHECK COMMITTEE MEMBERS MICHELLE CASTER OF THE SERVICE EMPLOYEES INTERNATIONAL UNION DESPITE A PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT OF. DEMOCRATIC CONTEXT AND PERSPECTIVE ON HOW. HERB GOT TO SUCH A LEVEL SUCH BIG BACKLOG. THE BOARD HAS BEEN UNDERFUNDED AS LONG AS ANY OF US CAN REMEMBER BUT THE PROBLEM WAS REALLY EXACERBATED IN TWO THOUSAND. UMPIRE TO TWO THOUSAND THE BOARD. ADMINISTERED ENFORCED THREE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING LAWS COVERING ABOUT TWO THOUSAND EMPLOYERS ABOUT TWO POINT SEVEN MILLION EMPLOYEES. IN TWO THOUSAND SB SEVEN THREE NINE WAS SIGNED INTO LAW THAT PUT THE MYERS MILIUS BROWN ACT UNDER THE BOARD. AND WHAT THAT IS ADDED THREE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED MORE EMPLOYERS IN APPROXIMATELY ONE POINT THREE MORE ON THREE POINT ONE POINT THREE MILLION MORE EMPLOYEES. AT THAT TIME A ONE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLAR REQUEST WAS MADE TO BOB FOR THEIR BUDGET TO ACCOMMODATE THE ADDITIONAL WORK. BUT INSTEAD TO ONLY TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND WAS PUT INTO THE BUDGET SINCE THEN ANOTHER FORMER COLLECTIVE BARGAINING ACCIDENT ADDED TO. PURPOSE RESPONSIBILITIES YET THEY'VE ONLY HAD MINOR ADJUSTMENTS HERE AND THERE. AS NOTED IN ANALYSIS PURP WAS GIVEN MORE. LA. RESPONSIBILITY IN THE BILL'S LAST YEAR AND YES I'VE ONLY. SEEN VERY MINOR CHANGES BUT THE LOT REALLY HASN'T BEEN FULLY IMPLEMENTED YET SO WE JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO COME OUT OF THAT. WE HOPE THAT THIS BODY WOULD. AUGMENT THEIR BUDGET BY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ON SO THEY CAN PROCESS CASES FASTER THAN THE HUNTER APPROXIMATE HUNDRED FIFTY DAYS. HUNDRED FIFTY DAYS IS ABOUT FIVE MONTHS IF YOU HAVE A COMPLAINT FIVE MONTHS LATER YOUR COMPLAINT MIGHT BE MOVED. SO REALLY MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR THE PARTIES TO GET ANY KIND OF ITEM. JUSTICE A REDRESS ONE THE BACKLOG IS SO. SO DEEP SO WE WOULD. REALLY REQUEST YOUR CONSIDERATION OF FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE BOARD THANK YOU THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS IT'S MICHAEL YA ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION. WE AGREE WITH EVERYTHING CHAU CASHEL. ALLUDED TO AND WE ALSO AGREE WITH YOUR LINE OF QUESTIONING THE SOLUTION HERE IS TO MAKE SURE THAT PARK HAS MORE MONEY THEY HAVE ANYMORE STAFF MEMBERS TO BE ABLE TO PROCESS THESE CLAIMS THAT MORE EFFICIENTLY AND MORE COST EFFECTIVELY. MORE MORE AT THE PER BOARD IS GOING TO BE A ESSENTIAL IN TERMS OF AYE DEALING WITH GROUP DISPUTES THE WORKPLACE IN TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR PUBLIC SECTOR HAS A HARMONIOUS RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN. BOTH EMPLOYER EMPLOYEES DUH THE LENGTH OF THESE BACKLOGS JUST GROWING BY TOO MUCH LENGTH. BETWEEN WHICH THESE DISPUTES ARE BEING HERS IS GROWING BY TOO LONG AND MORE AND MORE WORKERS ARE VIEWING CURVE AS. AS IN SUCCESSFUL OPTION IN RESOLVING THESE DISPUTES. SO. IT'S OUR OPINION THAT. THIS BODY SHOULD CONSIDER. SERIOUSLY CONSIDER GIVING HER MORE MONEY OUR RECOMMENDATION IS. AGAIN FIVE MILLION DOLLAR ONGOING AUGMENTATION SUPERB TO MAKE SURE THEY HAVE THE STAFFING RESOURCES NECESSARY TO MEET THE NEEDS OF OUR PUBLIC WORKERS THANK YOU. THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS CHRISSY BAUM ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA'S PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS. I'VE BEEN STANDING HERE BEFORE YOU BEFORE SAYING THE SAME THINGS I APPRECIATE THE QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. I THINK IT'S INTERESTING MAYBE THE QUESTION MORE IS ARE YOU FULLY RESOURCE AS AN AGENCY IN ORDER MEET. NOT JUST THE STATUTORY MANDATES BECAUSE YOU WON'T BE ALARMED TO FIND THAT THERE AREN'T ANY WITH RESPECT TO TIME LINES SO. CAN YOU MEET THE POLICY MANDATES THE INTENT OF THE ENTIRE ORGANIZATION TO RESOLVE CASES QUICKLY. IF YOU'RE OKAY WITH FIVE YEARS OR SEVEN YEARS THAN THEIR MEETING THEIR STATUTORY MIND MANDATES BECAUSE THERE ARE NONE. A MAN I WOULD ONLY ADD THAT THE THE CASE PROCESSING EFFICIENCIES PROJECT THE BOARD UNDERWENT. THEY DID DO AN AMAZING JOB SOLICITING IMPACT FROM STAKEHOLDER FEEDBACK FROM STAKEHOLDERS. AND DEVELOPED AN EXTENSIVE LIST OF THINGS THEY COULD DO TO IMPROVE THEIR OPERATIONS AND GUESS WHAT NEARLY ALL OF THEM HAVE A LITTLE STAR BY THEM THAT SAYS. AND THIS ALL WILL COST US MORE MONEY. SO WELL MAYBE THERE HASN'T BEEN A FORTHCOMING REQUEST OR AT LEAST THAT HAS MADE IT ALL THE WAY OUT TO THE PUBLIC VIEW WE URGE YOU TO CONSIDER AN AUGMENTATION AS DESCRIBE BY MY COLLEAGUES ABOUT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO PURPOSE BUDGET. SO THEY CAN DO THE JOB THAT THEY'RE SIGNED TO DO WHICH IS TO CREATE LABOR PEACE. THANK YOU THANK YOU.

SCHOOLS OCCUPATIONAL INJURY AND ILLNESS PREVENTION PROGRAMS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THIS SOME OF THIS PROPOSAL ARM WILL. ALBEIT THE DIVISION SO FUNDING FOR A LIMITED TERM I'M ONLY TERM BASIS FOR THREE YEARS OUGHT TO HELP SCHOOLS IMPLEMENT. IT INJURY AND ILLNESS PREVENTION PROGRAMS. THE SOURCE OF THIS FUNDING. A COMES FROM. WHEN SCHOOLS ARE CITED. THEY HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ABATE THAT CITATION AND WHEN THEY DO THEY HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO REQUEST. THE RETURN OF THOSE FUNDS. THE LABOR COAL PROVIDES A PROVISION FOR THE USE OF THOSE DOLLARS IF THE MONEY IS NOT REQUESTED TO BE RETURNED. THEN THAT THIS MONEY IS TO BE MADE AVAILABLE FOR GRANTS FOR THIS VERY PURPOSE AND SO IT TAKES A LITTLE WHILE FOR THE FUNDS TO ACCUMULATE THEY'VE DONE SO. THIS IS PROBABLY THIS THIRD SECOND OR THIRD TIME THAT WE'VE ASKED FOR A ONE TIME AUGMENTATION OF FOR THIS PURPOSE. MS REVOLVING FUND HAVE TO REACH A CERTAIN LEVEL BEFORE THE FUNDS CAN BE USED. THAT NOT NECESSARILY BUT BUT THE FUNDS TRICKLE IN IN THAT SPORADIC WAY. AND SCHOOLS WHO ARE ARE CITED IN HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY A TO ABATE THEY HAVE SO MANY YEARS IN ORDER TO PUT IN THE REQUEST SO WE HAVE TO WAIT. FOR THAT TIME COLLAPSE. AND BEFORE WE KNOW THAT THOSE FUNDS COULD NOW BE FREED UP AND AVAILABLE FOR THIS PURPOSE OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH ELIDEL. FINANCE. A PUBLIC COMMENT NOTION SPEAK. KILL CLOSE PUBLIC COMMENT. WRITTEN DIGITAL THIS ITEM OPEN SOLD OPEN THANK YOU. WE GOT ISSUED EVER EIGHT VICTIMS OF WAGE THEFT. SO THIS OP PROPOSAL IS ABOUT TAKING ON MONEY FROM THE UNPAID WAIT FUND WHICH IS MONIES THAT HAVE BEEN COLLECTED ON BEHALF OF WORKERS WHO WERE NOT PAID WHAT THEY SHOULD'VE BEEN PAID. BUT THE WORKERS COULD NOT BE FOUND SO FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS WHATEVER THE REASONS ARE THE WORKERS CANNOT DIRECTLY BE STEVE THE MONEY SO MONEY GOES INTO UNPAID WAGE UND. OUR REQUEST IS TO ACTUALLY TAKE THAT MONEY INSTEAD OF HAVING IT GOING TO THE GENERAL FUND AFTER CERTAIN P. OF TIME IN WHICH IT'S NOT CLAIMED. HAVE YOU GO TO ANY ONE OF OUR RESTITUTION FUNDS AND WE HAVE BY STATUTE THREE RESTITUTION FUNDS THAT HELP TO SERVE THE LOWEST PAID WORKERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THERE'S A FARM WORKER RESTITUTION FUND. CAR WASH RESTITUTION FUND AND A GARMENT INDUSTRY RESTITUTION FUND AND WHAT HAPPENS THERE IS ANY WORKER IN THOSE INDUSTRIES WHO PROVE THAT THEIR WAGES ARE HAVE BEEN STOLEN AND THAT THAT WE JUST OWE TO THEM SO THE WORKERS HAVE COME FORWARD. USUALLY THEY'VE GONE THROUGH OUR WAGE CLAIM PROCESS MAYBE WE'VE DONE A BOTH THE INVESTIGATION TO FIND THAT THERE THAT THEY WERE UNDERPAID. AND THEY HAVE A FINAL JUDGEMENT FOR WAGES THEY IF THERE'S NO OTHER WAY TO GO GET THE MONEY THE EMPLOYER HAS ABSCONDED CLOSE SHOP. THEN THEY CAN GO THE RESTITUTION FUND TO GET THEIR MONEY AND CURRENTLY THOSE FUNDS ARE NOT SUFFICIENT TO MEET THE CLAIMS ON THEM JUST AS THE EXAMPLE OF FOR THE IN THE GARMENT FUND. WE'VE HAD MADE OVER FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN CLAIMS BY GARMENT WORKERS WHO HAVE WE JUDGMENTS. TO THOSE FUNDS AND A SINCE FIFTEEN SIXTEEN THERE HAS NOT BEEN SUFFICIENT FUNDING TO PAY THEM OUT SO WE'D LIKE TO DO IS TAKE MONEY. THAT BELONGS TO SOME WORKERS WHO CAN'T GET NOTIFIED AND TRACK THEM TO FUNDS WERE THE WILL GO TO OTHER WORKERS WHO WHO HAD BEEN IDENTIFIED IN WHO WERE AWAITING THEIR HARD EARNED WAGES. OKAY HOW MUCH FUNDING DOES THE UNPAID WHICH PHONE RECEIVE EVERY YEAR. OF THE AVERAGE A COMING INTO THE UNPAID WAGE FUND FOR THE LAST THREE TO FOUR YEARS HAS VARIED BETWEEN THREE MILLION AND SIX MILLION A YEAR. SO THIS IS A ONE TIME REQUEST TO A DIVERT SOME OF THAT FUNDING. PRIOR TO TRANSFER TO THE GENERAL FUND TO THESE WORKERS WHO HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED SO THERE ARE ACTUAL WORKERS WE HAVE ACTUAL CLAIMS THAT WE ARE HOLDING. BECAUSE OF INSUFFICIENT FUNDS IN THE GARMENT RESTITUTION. AND WATER COMES FROM FUNDS COME FROM. OF THAT THE SOURCE OF THE MONEY IS. AND MAYBE YOU CAN. ELABORATE ON THAT JUST. WHAT WILL THE SOURCE OF THE MONEY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS FROM OTHER PAYMENTS IN OTHER CASES TO WORKERS SO FOR EXAMPLE WE MAY HAVE? A CASE IN ANYINDUSTRY WHERE THE EMPLOYER WAS FOUND TO OWE WAGES. BUT OFTENTIMES ESPECIALLY IN THESE MULTIPLE INDUSTRIES THE WORKERS ARE NOT AVAILABLE AT THE TIME THAT THAT THE JUDGMENT IS MADE AND THE PAYMENT IS MADE. AND SO ONCE THE EMPLOYER AND WE DO IT DAR DO DILIGENCE TO FIND OUT WE CANNOT THAT MONEY IS STILL PAID BY THE EMPLOYER BUT IT DOESN'T GO TO. THE THE WORKERS BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT THERE ANYMORE SO THAT SO THAT'S WHERE THAT GOES THE GOES INTO UNPAID WAIT FUN BUT GENERALLY THE RESTITUTION FUND MONEY COMES FROM. PAYMENTS MADE BY EMPLOYERS IN THOSE INDUSTRIES WHEN THEY REGISTER SO PORTION OF THE REGISTRATION FEE GOES INTO THIS RESTITUTION FUND AND WE'RE JUST FINE THAT THAT AMOUNT IS NOT ENOUGH TO MEET THE. DEMANDS OF WORKERS FOR UNPAID WAGES. THANK YOU BELIAU. DLF. WELL LET'S BREAK IT IS THE AND IT'S STILL GOING BACK TO VICTIMS SO THAT'S THE YOU KNOW WHEN WE ANOTHER. WERE STILL BEING SOMEONE THAT'S OBVIOUSLY BEEN WRONG. ANYONE WISH TO SPEAK ON THIS ITEM. OKAY A CLOSE PUBLIC COMMENT. OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS ALL THIS ITEM OPEN. SO WILL MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT ITEM WHICH IS A SHAME NUMBER NINE LEGISLATION. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN ISSUE NUMBER NINE. IS A COLLECTION OF THREE. OF BILLS THAT WERE PASSED BY THE LEGISLATURE.

THE CALIFORNIA WORK FIRST DEVELOPMENT BOARD CALIFORNIA GLOBAL WARMING SOLUTIONS ACT. SO JAMAICA BUT WITH THERE WAS ONE MORE IN A LEGISLATIVE BILL I DON'T KNOW IF WE NEED TO. TALK ABOUT IT BUT THERE WAS AN S. B. THREE OH SIX THE WHOLE TOGETHER OKAY BUT THEY WERE ALL INTO THE SAME THING SO I JUST I WE. WE BROKE OUT BUT THIS IS LEGISLATION STRENGTHENING ANTI RETALIATION PROTECTIONS. IT BIT DOES IT HAVE TO THE POWERS OF THE LABOR COMMISSIONER TO DO CERTAIN THINGS SPECIFICALLY TO BE ABLE TO ISSUE CITATIONS IN CERTAIN INSTANCES RATHER GOING TO THE COURTS WHICH TEND TO BE SLOWER. A AND SO WE CAN NOW ISSUE CITATIONS WHEN WE FIND RETALIATION. IT ALSO ALLOWS US TO PROCEED WITHOUT A WORKER COMPLAINT IN CERTAIN INSTANCES THOSE ARE VERY NARROW INSTANCES IN WHICH IT'S VERY LIKELY THAT WE WOULD OF SEEN THE RETALIATION FIRSTHAND. FOR EXAMPLE WORKER COMES TO FILE A WAGE CLAIM AND EMPLOYER IN OUR OFFICE MAY SAY SOMETHING LIKE I CAN'T WE FIND A WAY TO CLAIM TO HAVE BE DEPORTED. OR YOU CAN BEFALL THE WAGE CLAIM YOU KNOW YOU'RE YOU'RE FIRED BECAUSE OF IT. AND ORDERING A FIELD INVESTIGATION WHERE WE WE SOMETIMES SEE THE RETALIATION ALSO OR FOR IMMIGRATION BASED RETALIATION SO WE CAN IN. IT UP PROCEED WITHOUT A COMPLAINT BECAUSE OFTENTIMES THOSE INSTANCES THE WORKERS ARE SO VULNERABLE AND SO AFRAID AFTER THE THREATEN THAT THEY THEY WILL FILE ONE.

AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT SERVICES TO HELP THE STATE TRANSITION. DUE TO CHANGES IN THE ECONOMY RELATED TO STATEWIDE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS GOALS BUT THE LOT. THE CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD MUST CONTRACT WITH SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS TO PRODUCE THE LEGISLATIVE REPORT. COMPLETION OF THE REPORT REQUIRES EXPERTISE IN LABOR ECONOMICS STATE CLIMATE POLICIES AND REGULATORY PROCESSES AS WELL AS THE ENERGY AND TRANSPORTATION INDUSTRIES. AND IS BEYOND THE CAPACITY OF THE STATE BOARD STAFF TO PRODUCE. THANK YOU LL. FINANCE. THE PUBLIC COMMENT. THE RECOMMENDATIONS ALL THIS ITEM OPENS WILL HOLD OPEN. NEXT I WAS ISSUED NUMBER ELEVEN.

THE WORKFORCE INNOVATION OPPORTUNITY ACT INCLUDING MODIFICATIONS TO THAT WE OWE A STATE PLAN IN SUPPORT OF THE STATE'S GOAL OF PRODUCING ONE MILLION INDUSTRY VALUED CREDENTIALS. OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS STATE BOARD IS EXPANDING THE REACH REACH THE REACH OF THE WE HAVE A STATE PLAN. BY ADDING PARTNERS AND PROGRAMS RELEVANT TO SPECIFIC POPULATIONS TO IMPROVE THE ALIGNMENT OF THESE PROGRAMS WITH THE STATE'S WORKFORCE SYSTEM AND ULTIMATELY BETTER SERVE THESE POPULATIONS THE STATE BOARD HAS ENTERED INTO. A COMPREHENSIVE PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS. KELPIE I A. TO INTEGRATE A LINE AND COORDINATE PRE RELEASE EDUCATION AND PRISONER TRAINING INITIATIVES WITH POST RELEASE REENTRY AND WORK FOR SERVICES. AND FORTY FIVE LOCAL WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AREAS AND FOURTEEN WORKFORCE REGION STATEWIDE. ADDITIONALLY STATE BORDERS ENTERED INTO A PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES AND THE CALIFORNIA WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION. TO BUILD PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN THE CAL FRESH IMPLEMENT IN TRAINING PROGRAM AND LOCAL WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS. ADDITIONALLY THE BOARD IS ENTERED INTO ANOTHER PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES TO COORDINATE THE PROVISION. OF WORKFORCE SERVICES FOR THE STATE'S UNEMPLOYED NONCUSTODIAL PARENT POPULATION. HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. WELL. FINANCE. ANY PUBLIC COMMENT. THE RECOMMENDATIONS DELUDE SADDAM OPEN LAW WOULD OPEN. LAST AUTUMN ITEM NUMBER TWELVE. THE THIRD ITEM IS THE PRISON TO EMPLOYMENT INITIATIVE AND RELATED TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. THIS PROPOSAL CONTAINS FUNDING TO FACILITATE THE SYSTEMATIC. ALIGNMENT IN COORDINATION OF THE PRE RELEASE REHABILITATIVE RE ENTRY TRAINING AND EDUCATION PROGRAMS OPERATED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND CAL PIAA. WITH POST RELEASE REENTRY AND WORK FOR SERVICES OFFERED IN THE STATE'S FOURTEEN WORKFORCE REGION'S. THE FUNDING IS FOR STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS LOCAL WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD'S PAROLE PROBATION AND RE ENTRY SERVICE PROVIDERS TO DEVELOP COMPREHENSIVE REGIONAL PLANS. TO ALIGN RELEVANT PRE RELEASE REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMMING WITH POST RELEASE WORKFORCE EDUCATION AND REENTRY SERVICES. OFFERED TO THOSE RE ENTERING OUR COMMUNITIES. WE BELIEVE IT IS CRITICAL THAT ALL RELEVANT STAKEHOLDERS BE CONVENED TO DEVELOP THESE REGIONAL PLANTS SO THAT APPROPRIATE REFERRALS BE MADE TO ENSURE. THAT INDIVIDUALS CAN BOTH ACCESS RELEVANT SERVICES AND NAVIGATE BETWEEN PROGRAMS AS THEY REENTER SOCIETY AND ENTER THE JOB MARKET. THE FUNDING FOR THE PRISON TO THE PLANET THEY EMPLOYMENT INITIATIVES FOR PLANNING ACTIVITIES IMPLEMENTATION OF REGIONAL PLANS DIRECT SERVICES. SUPPORTIVE SERVICES AND EARN AND LEARN ACTIVITIES. THERE ARE THREE POTS OF MONEY. THE FIRST IS THE SMALLEST ONE POINT SEVEN FIVE MILLION IS FOR THE CONVENING OF STAKEHOLDERS AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF REGIONAL PLANS TO ALIGN. COORDINATE AND INTEGRATE REENTRY AND WORK FOR SERVICES. THE SECOND IS FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF REGIONAL PLANS AND THE PROVISION OF DIRECT WORKFORCE AND EDUCATION SERVICES. MISS PART OF MONIES FOURTEEN MILLION OVER TWO YEARS. THE THIRD PART OF MONEY IS TWENTY MILLION AND IS SET ASIDE FOR SUPPORTIVE SERVICES AND EARN AND LEARN ACTIVITIES. ALL THREE POTS OF MONEY ARE DESIGNED TO WORK IN CONCERT. ESTABLISHING A COMPREHENSIVE INTEGRATED POST RELEASE SYSTEM OF SUPPORTS TO HELP TRANSITION THE FORMERLY INCARCERATED BACK INTO OUR COMMUNITIES WHILE ALSO HELPING THEM TO SECURE EMPLOYMENT. I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS ESPECIALLY ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW THE INITIATIVE IS DESIGNED AND INTENDED TO ROLL OUT HOW THE POTS OF MONEY WORK TOGETHER. AND HOW THE INITIATIVE FITS WITH THE BOARD'S BROADER POLICY EFFORTS UNDER THE STATE PLAN. THANK YOU ALTHOUGH THE DOCTOR CHOI HAS JOINED US ITEM NUMBER QUESTIONS. OF THE STAFF ANALYSIS MENTIONS AB ELEVEN ELEVEN FROM LAST YEAR. AND ELIO MENTIONS A PREVIOUS PROGRAM WE REVIEW IS STILL PENDING. SO THERE ARE THOSE WHAT'S THE STATUS OF THE REVIEW. SO THE LEGISLATIVE REPORT IS IN THE FINAL REVIEW PROCESS THAT LEVER AGENCY AND IT SHOULD BE THE LEGISLATURE IN THE NEXT TWO TO THREE WEEKS. OKAY HOUSES PER PROGRAM PROPOSAL DIFFERENT. FROM THE FORD FOCUS PROGRAM. IT'S SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFERENT IT'S SO BOTH PROGRAMS ARE INTENDED. TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO THE SAME POPULATION. BUT THE FORWARD FOCUS PROGRAM IS A SMALL GRANTS TO COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THERE'S NOTHING IN THE FORD FOCUS PROGRAM THAT WOULD LEAD TO. SYSTEMATIC COMPREHENSIVE REGIONAL INTER. INTERACTION BETWEEN THE CORRECTIONS SYSTEM. AND THE WORK FORCE SYSTEM SO RIGHT NOW THE STATE SPENDS ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AND REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMMING. BUT TWO THIRDS OF THAT IS PRE RELEASE WITH A ANOTHER THIRD OF THAT IS POST RELEASE. THE STATE ALSO SPENDS FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OF FEDERAL WORKFORCE MONEY THOSE TWO. POTS OF MONEY ARE ESSENTIALLY OPERATING AS SILOS. OUR PROPOSAL IS TO PROVIDE GRANTS TO THE FOURTEEN WORKFORCE REGION'S TO GET THOSE SYSTEMS TO WORK TOGETHER. COLLABORATIVELY. NO FORWARD FOCUS PROGRAM. OUR SMALL GRANTS TO COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS SOME OF WHOM. PARTNER WITH LOCAL WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD'S BUT THE SCALE OF WHAT IS ACHIEVED UNDER THAT IS VERY DIFFERENT. SO HOW THE DIFFERENT FOR MAYBE I'LL WANNA LET ALONE ELEVEN EIGHTY ELEVEN ELEVEN IS ANOTHER GRANT PROGRAM THAT IS DESIGNED TO FOSTER RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND LOCAL WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD'S. THE SCOPE OF THAT GRANT PROGRAM IS FAR BROADER THERE'S FIFTEEN TARGET POPULATIONS UNDER THE AB ELEVEN ELEVEN PROGRAM IT'S IT IT'S JUST WE WHEN WE WERE PUTTINGTHIS PROPOSAL TOGETHER. FOR THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE WE LOOK VERY CLOSELY AT BOTH OF THOSE GRANT PROGRAMS TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THEY WERE APPROPRIATE VEHICLES. TO MEET THE ADMINISTRATION'S GOALS OF BRINGING THE CORRECTIONS SYSTEM AND THE WORKFORCE SYSTEM TOGETHER IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS OF. THOSE GRANT PROGRAMS ARE INCONSISTENT WITH THE OBJECTIVES OF THIS INITIATIVE FACILITIES PROGRAMS CROSSOVER. QUITE A BIT. AND MAY BE SOMEWHAT REDUNDANT. THEY'RE NOT REDUNDANT IN THAT THE STE THAT A COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATION GRANT PROGRAMS OR SMALL PROGRAMS. THE GRANTS TECH TENDER THEY RANGE FROM LIKE A HUNDRED TO TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT LARGE GRANTS OUT TO THE FOURTEEN REGION'S TO GET TO SYSTEMATICALLY INTEGRATE WORK FOR SERVICES WITH PRE RELEASE REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMMING. SO I KNOW THE LA WAS WRITTEN UP A BRIEF ON THIS I WANT TO DRAW YOUR ATTENTION. TO A BRIEF THE DELEO ISSUED IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN. CALLED ENHANCING PUBLIC SAFETY BY INCREASING PAROLEE EMPLOYMENT. AND THAT REPORT THE LA THOUGH FOCUSED ON THE IMPORTANCE OF SENATE HEARING WHAT WANT TO HOLD OFF ON A GOOD REALLY. FIRST ACTUALLY. SURE GOOD AFTERNOON CHAT DOWNLOAD THAT WHAT'S ANALYST'S OFFICE JUST YESTERDAY REALLY WE RELEASE S. ANALYSIS AND TO SUMMARIZE VERY BRIEFLY FIRST AND FOREMOST WE POINT OUT THAT THE LOGIC OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO US MAKE SENSE. INTEGRATE SERVICES OF THE LOCAL LEVEL BETWEEN CORRECTIONS AND WORKFORCE SPORTS COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS. AN EFFORT TO IMPROVE THE SERVICES THAT EX OFFENDERS RECEIVE. HELPS THEM FIND AND MAINTAIN STABLE EMPLOYMENT WITH THE HOPE THAT THAT PREVENTS THEM FROM RECEIPT OF IT. TO LOGIC MAKES SENSE IN THE COURSE OF OUR ANALYSIS WE DID UNCOVER THAT. THERE ARE SOME STRIKING SIMILARITIES TO IN PARTICULAR AB TWENTY SIXTY ARMY SEEMS LIKE MUCH OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WAS BASED ON ON THAT PROPOSED PROVISIONS AND THE EXPERIENCE OF THOSE GRANTEES HAVE HAD. AND SO WHEN WE ARE THINKING ABOUT THIS. IT SEEMED AS THOUGH AB TWENTY SIXTY AND THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WERE SO SIMILAR. THAT THE LEGISLATURE WOULD REALLY BENEFIT FROM HAVING AN OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW. THE STATUTORILY REQUIRED REPORT ON THAT THE STATE BOARD OF PREPARING AND WILL SUBMIT SHORTLY BEFORE DECIDING WHETHER TO. NOTABLY INCREASE AND VESTMENTS IN WORKFORCE SERVICES FOR EX OFFENDERS. FINANCE. WE JUST I'D WISH TO REITERATE SUPPORT FOR THIS. FOR THIS INITIATIVE THIS INITIATIVE PROVIDES TARGETED IN CONFERENCE SUPPORT FOR THE EXAMINER POPULATION. A QUESTION OF THE COMMITTEE. I'M WILL HEAD UP A PUBLIC COMMENT ASIDE AND EMOTION SPEAK. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MARKUP PRAYER I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE. CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE ASSOCIATION AT THE OUTSET I WANT TO MAKE CLEAR THAT WE ARE IN NO WAY. SEEKING TO DETRACT FROM THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. BUT WE WANT TO BRING TO YOUR ATTENTION. AB ELEVEN ELEVEN WHICH YOUR COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. LAYS OUT THAT THIS LEGISLATION WAS. NEARLY I WAS BACKED BY A NEAR UNANIMOUS VOTE OF BOTH HOUSES OF THE LEGISLATURE. AND IN ADDITION TO. PRISON POPULATIONS I IT IDENTIFIES FIFTEEN UP FOURTEEN OTHER POPULATIONS INCLUDING YOUTH WHO ARE DISCONNECTED FROM THE EDUCATION SYSTEM MORE EMPLOYMENT. WOMEN SEEKING TRAINING ARE OR EDUCATION TO MOVE INTO NONTRADITIONAL FIELDS OF EMPLOYMENT PERSONS FOR WHOM ENGLISH IS NOT A PRIMARY LANGUAGE. ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED PERSONS VETERANS NATIVE AMERICANS MIGRANTS OUR SEASONAL FARM WORKERS PERSONS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES OR OTHER DISABILITIES. IMMIGRANTS AND PERSONS OVER OVER FIFTY SO WE WOULD ASK. THIS COMMITTEE AND THE LEGISLATURE AND THE ADMINISTRATION. TO. CONSIDER. FUNDING A. B. ELEVEN ELEVEN A MEASURE THAT WAS AGAIN PASSED BY THE LEGISLATURE. LAST YEAR AND. SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR I HAD A NOT JUST IN TERMS OF THE OUTCOMES OF THE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT SYSTEM DATA FOR FY. TWENTY FIFTEEN SHOWS A RETURN ON INVESTMENT OF A DOLLARS SEVENTY ONE FOR EVERY DOLLAR SPENT NATIONALLY WITH LOCAL LEADERS IN CALIFORNIA. SEEKING A SITTING US AND HIGHER RETURNS IN BEING ABLE TO EXPAND THE BENEFITS TO THESE POPULATIONS AYE WE THINK ARE IMPORTANT AND WOULD RESULT IN THE STATE GETTING MORE THAN ITS MONEY'S WORTH IN GETTING AT. A GOOD RETURN ON ITS INVESTMENT AND SO WE'D ASK AS YOU'D A DELIBERATE THE BUDGET THAT YOU CONSIDER EXPANDING THE FUNDING AND WE'VE REQUESTED A. ARE AUGMENTED OR A FUNDING FOR THE FOR A. B. ELEVEN ELEVEN OF TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU. AS CHAIR MEMBERS HAS IDEAS ON HOW THE STATE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL OF VERY HAPPY TO BE SUPPORTIVE OF THE UC GENERAL. PLANS HERE TO. ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES REALLY RECIDIVISM IN THE STATE PRISONS THE BUILDING TRADES HAVE BEEN PARTNERS. AND HAVE BEEN ACTUALLY TRYING TO ASSIST INMATES ARE BOTH AT THE P. AYE A AND CDC ARE. THROUGH THE CALPE AYE A PROGRAM PROVOKE ADD AS WELL AS THE INMATE WORK LABOR PROGRAM. WE'VE ALSO WORKED WITH THE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD THE STATE IN THIS LEGISLATURE TO ALIGN THE SYSTEM AS IT RELATES TO BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES A PARTNERSHIP PREPARATION PROGRAMS. I THINK SOME OF YOUR COMMENTS CAN ABOUT LINE THE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS THAT ARE OUT THERE WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO NAVIGATE WITHIN ALL OF THAT AND COMBINE THEM. SO THAT THERE'S ONE CURRICULUM THAT WILL HELP ALL PRE APPRENTICES ENTER THE APPRENTICESHIP SYSTEM. WHICH SHOT WE ARE VERY PROUD OF IN THE STATE HAVE ABOUT FIFTY THOUSAND APPRENTICES. RIGHT NOW THIS LET THAT THIS LEGISLATION THIS TRAILER BILL HAS THAT DIRECTION WE BELIEVE IT GO A LITTLE BIT FURTHER BY INCORPORATING THE MC THREE CURRICULUM WHICH IS THE STATE CURRICULUM THAT LEADS TO ALL THE PRE PARTNERSHIP MEAN THE OPPRESSION PERMITS IN THE STATE. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AGENCY AND THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND YOURSELF AS WELL TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES THANK YOU. IN A REPORT COMING OUT IN THE NEXT MONTH OR SO STUFF BY REASON RECIDIVISM AT ALL HER DRESS THAT. NO IT DOESN'T. WHAT IT DOES IS IT LOOKS SAID THE THE PLACEMENT RATES IN THE WAGES FOR FOLKS WHO WENT THROUGH THE PROGRAM'S AND KIND OF BREAKS THEM OUT BY THE LEVEL OF SERVICE THAT THEY HAD? TALKS ABOUT PROMISING PRACTICES THAT WE'VE KIND OF ON EARTH THROUGH. INTERACTING WITH THE GRANTEES. WE ASSEMBLE THEM A THREE FOUR TIMES A YEAR TALK ABOUT WHAT THE PROMISING PRACTICES ARE IN THESE. BECAUSE I'M LEARNING COMMUNITIES. SO THERE'S SOME DISCUSSION AROUND YOU KNOW WHAT ARE THE ASPECTS OF PROGRAMS THAT ARE MORE PROMISING. THAN OTHER PROGRAMS FOR EXAMPLE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE FOUND ON FROM TALKING TO GRANTEES IS VERY IMPORTANT HAVE. LAW ENFORCEMENT AT THE TABLE WHEN WE'RE IMPLEMENTING THESE PROGRAMS ON DE INVOLVEMENT OF PROBATION OFFICERS ON IN DOING SOME OF THE CASE MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES. PINSCHERS BETTER OUTCOMES AND SO. IN DESIGNING THE PRISON TO EMPLOYMENT INITIATIVE WE'VE TRIED TO LEARN FROM THOSE SMALL GRANTS AND AND IN DEVELOPING A MORE COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH SO. IT IS SIMILAR IN THAT THE THE PRISON TO EMPLOYMENT MISSION OF HAS A LOT OF THE SAME OBJECTIVES OF TWENTY SIXTY. BUT IT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT IT'S MORE SKILLED UP IT'S LIKE. IT'S LIKE GOING FROM YOU KNOW OF OF YOU KNOW LIKE A FOUR CYLINDER CAR TO THE JEEP. DOESN'T MEASURE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PROGRAM IT LOOKS AT THE RATES OF EMPLOYMENT FOR PEOPLE WHO GO THROUGH THE PROGRAM. BASED ON. THE LEVEL OF SERVICE THAT THEY GOT SO DOESN'T LOOK AT RECIDIVISM DIRECTLY THE ORIGINAL BOND LANGUAGE IN AB TWENTY SIXTY DOESN'T ASK US TO LOOK AT RECIDIVISM Y. MINNESOTA RESPONSIVE TO THE STATUTORY MENTAL THERE'S A MEASURE OF EFFECTIVENESS. YEAH ISN'T IT WHEN LOGS PROBLEMS WE SEE WE REALLY DON'T SEE MEASURES ARE METRICS AND DEVELOP PROGRAMS THAT A LOT OF GOOD PROGRAMS OUT THERE. AND WHAT A HORRIBLE PROGRAMS OUT THERE IF FOR SOME THESE COMMUNITY GROUPS IT'S A MONEY GRAB. RIGHT SO JUST YOU KNOW PEOPLE OUT THERE APPLYING IT JUST THOUGHT I'D IS THIS'LL WORK THIS THE WORK I MEAN ONE PROGRAM THEY HAD. WAS WAS ROCK CLIMBING AND I'M NOT REALLY SURE HOW ROCK CLIMBING. EQUATES TO YOU KNOW KEEPING SOMEONE AT OUR JAILS ARE PRISON SERVING A REAL BILL TAKING THEM SO. LIKE SAID IS A HODGE PODGE PROGRAMS THAT'S ONE THING THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HASN'T DONE A GOOD JOB THAT IS LOOKING GET. IN DEPTH MORE THE MOST EFFECTIVE PROGRAMS OUT THERE AND YOU KNOW COPPING THOSE WE WE'VE NOT SEEN THAT HAS PLAGUED. THE BIGGEST ISSUE IN FINDING OUT KNOW WHAT'S EFFECTIVE AND WHAT'S NOT. WE'VE BEEN INTO THIS I MEAN THEY'RE STILL GRANTS GOING ON. WHERE THIS QUITE A BIT YOU KNOW SORT OF AB ONE I FELT A NUMBER OF YEARS A LOT OF MONEY'S BEEN THROWN? AND YOU KNOW WHAT SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE I'VE NEVER SEEN. YOU KNOW WHAT THE BEST PRACTICES ARE MONO LEGAL MY MEMBERS I TALKED TO IF NOT SEEN THOSE BEST PRACTICES AND THAT'S. AS WITHIN LACKING SO A QUESTION FOR YOU HOW COME THERE'S AN AT BCP. TO ACT A. B. ELEVEN OF ELEVEN ELEVEN. WHY ISN'T THERE BCP DOING ACT A. B. ELEVEN ELEVEN YEAH I'M I DON'T KNOW? ASKED DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THAT. DIRECTLY WITH THE PART OF FINANCE. I JUST WANT TO REITERATE SOME OF WHAT MR ROUND SAID ABOUT THE VERY TARGETED NATURE OF OTHER PRISON DEPLOYMENT INITIATIVE AND. TO HIGHLIGHT SOMETHING YOU DECIDE MISTER COOPER INSTEAD OF HAVING SORT OF HODGE PODGE DOLLARS SPENT THAT WE WOULD REALLY LOOK AT WHAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE ON THE GROUND AND THAT WE WOULD. BE ABLE TO CREATE A FREE WELL FOR A LOT OF THE FRAMEWORK IS ALREADY THERE BUT TO THAT ENHANCE. THE REGIONAL LOCAL PLANNING. THAT'S ARE HAPPENING SO THAT'S. THAT YOU KNOW SHOULD OF. THAT WE ARE PROPOSING AT THIS POINT IS VERY TARGETED AND IT IS A PRIORITY OF THE THE GOVERNOR. IT WAS STILL GOES BACK TO THE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION THAT WE. REALLY DON'T HAVE AN EFFECTIVE MEASURE OF FOCUS SAID A LOT OF MONEY BESIDES. ELEVEN ELEVEN ADDRESS THESE AND. BILLS AND PROGRAMS AND GRANTS. I MEAN NOTICES HERE AND TELL ME DEFINITIVELY WHAT'S WORKING AND WHAT'S NOT VISIT OR THE LEGISLATIVE REPORT WILL ANSWER SOME OF THOSE QUESTIONS I ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT IN THE TRAILER BILL FOR THIS INITIATIVE. THERE'S VERY ROBUST LANGUAGE AROUND EVALUATION ASSESSMENT OF THE PROGRAM'S THE OTHER THING THAT I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT TO THE COMMITTEE IS THE. PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT WITH WITH THAT WE HAVE WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS. THERE'S BEEN INCORPORATED INTO THE STATE PLAN. FORESEES THE DEPARTMENT CORRECTION SHARING INFORMATION WITH THE STATE WORKFORCE BOARDING ET DE SO THAT WE CAN TRACK INDIVIDUALS INTO THE LABOR MARKET. NAM AND MEASURE WHICH PROGRAMS WHICH PRE RELEASE REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS ARE HAVING THE MOST SUCCESS IN HELPING SECURE PEOPLE. ON JOBS IN THAT SO I I'D BE HAPPY TO PROVIDE THE COMMITTEE WITH A COPY OF THAT WORKFORCE PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT. WE SHARE YOUR CONCERN WITH EVALUATION ASSESSMENT OF PROGRAMS AND AND HAVE A WORK PLAN FOR INSURING THAT THAT WE HAVE GOOD INFORMATION ABOUT WHICH PROGRAMS ARE WORKING AND WHICH ONES ARE STILL ONLY ASSESSMENT BEGIN. WHEN WILL THE ASSESSMENT BEGIN. SO THE ASSESSMENT FOR THIS PROGRAM IS CONTINGENT ON THE LEGISLATURE FUNDING THE PROGRAM. ON IN THE TRAILER BILL THERE'S LANGUAGE IT SPELLS OUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO MEASURE THE OUTCOMES. WE ARE IN THE PROCESS IN FACT I HAD STAFF MEETING WITH CORRECTIONS STAFF OVER THE LAST TWO WEEKS TO TALK ABOUT HOW WE CAN. SHARE DATA ACROSS PROGRAMS TO TO TRACK THEM INTO THE LABOR MARKET WOULD WAIT WE WILL PROBABLY GET DATA THAT LIKE WITH THE DUE DATE ASSURING AGREEMENT. WILL HAVE WILL WILL PROBABLY BE ABLE TO ACTUALLY LOOK AT OUTCOMES SOMETIME NEXT YEAR. NEST WITH MY BIG ISSUE IS OUTCOMES AND I'M JUST BEING THE CHAIR THIS COMMITTEE I HAVE A HARD TIME GOING FORWARD WITH ITEMS. WE OUTCOMES ARE KNOWN JUST GIVING MONEY AWAY. TO PROGRAMS I'M ALL FOR REHABILITATION BUT WE'VE DONE A LOT I GUESS IF YOU GO BACK TO AB ONE ONLINE IN IN TWO THOUSAND NINETY THOUSAND AND. PROP 47-57 IN A MYRIAD OF BILLS THAT COME THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE WE'VE DONE A LOT. INFILL LOT OF TAXPAYER MONEY THESE PROGRAMS AND YOU KNOW IS THE CLERK POURED THE OTHER DAY THE RECIDIVISM RATE WAS. CLOSE FIFTY PERCENT. AND THAT'S JUST AT THE ON THE STATE LEVEL HAS NOT LOOKING AT THE COUNTY LEVEL AND THERE'S NO METRICS FOR THAT AND AS WE KNOW RIGHT NOW. MOST FOLKS NAY RE OFFEND THEY DON'T GO BACK TO STATE PRISON THEY GO TO COUNTY JAILS. UNLESS YOU GUYS WERE THAT MOSTLY OFFENDERS GO TO COUNTY JAIL. AND NO ONE IN THE STATE CAN TELL ME WHAT THOSE NUMBERS ARE FIGURES ARE SO THERE'S A LOT OF. A GRAY AREA HERE THAT WE WANT TO GET TO AND. YOU KNOW I'M GONNA HOLD AGENCIES ACCOUNTABLE WITH THOSE NUMBERS AND NOT JUST WRITE A BLANK CHECK. BUT SO THIS POINT. THANK YOU ALL FOR JOINING US TODAY THAT INCLUDES OUR HEARING WE BACK NEXT WEEK
