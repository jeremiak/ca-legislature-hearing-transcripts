USE OF MATERIALS FROM POOR SELF

00:32:18.236 --> 00:32:19.637
PROJECTS. THIS IS REALLY

00:32:19.704 --> 00:32:21.406
IMPORTANT IF YOU.

00:32:21.472 --> 00:32:24.242
HERE RIGHT NOW IF THE SCALE OF

00:32:24.309 --> 00:32:25.410

RESTORATION ACTIVITIES.

00:32:31.716 --> 00:32:34.419
MOST OF THOSE THOSE PRODUCTS GO.

00:32:34.485 --> 00:32:36.321
.

00:32:36.387 --> 00:32:38.790
I'M USED ESSENTIALLY AND AND AND

00:32:38.856 --> 00:32:40.458
BURNT IN PILES ON THE FLOOR ONCE

00:32:40.525 --> 00:32:42.360
FOREST. THINNING ACTIVITIES

00:32:42.427 --> 00:32:44.195
COMPLETED SO THERE'S A REAL.

00:32:44.262 --> 00:32:46.397
.

00:32:46.464 --> 00:32:48.599
REAL OPPORTUNITY TO FIND NEW

00:32:48.666 --> 00:32:50.335
WAYS TO USE THOSE MATERIALS THAT

00:32:50.401 --> 00:32:51.936
CAN ALSO THEY CAN THEY CAN

00:32:52.003 --> 00:32:54.038
REDUCE OUR JUST BURNING OF THESE

00:32:54.105 --> 00:32:54.605
MATERIALS ON THE GROUND IN

00:32:54.672 --> 00:32:56.107
CREATING THAT. THEY ARE QUALITY

00:32:56.174 --> 00:32:57.608
IN CARBON EMISSIONS AT THAT HAS

00:32:57.675 --> 00:33:00.278
BUT ALSO CREATE ECONOMIES AROUND

00:33:00.345 --> 00:33:01.312
THE USE OF THESE MATERIALS IN A

00:33:01.379 --> 00:33:01.846
WAY THAT.

00:33:01.913 --> 00:33:04.549
WILL HOPEFULLY INCENTIVIZE IN A

00:33:04.615 --> 00:33:05.817
WHIRL.

00:33:05.883 --> 00:33:08.519
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND SO

00:33:08.586 --> 00:33:10.421
WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING HERE IS

00:33:10.488 --> 00:33:11.756
THEM BY THREE PROPOSALS THE.

00:33:11.823 --> 00:33:13.024
BOARD OF THE FIRST ONE WOULD BE

00:33:13.091 --> 00:33:14.158
THE BOARD OF FORESTRY AND FIRE

00:33:14.225 --> 00:33:15.026
PROTECTION.

SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND

00:33:16.794 --> 00:33:18.663
DOLLARS IN THIS BUDGET YEAR. AND

00:33:18.730 --> 00:33:20.298
THEN SOME FUNDING ON GOING TO

00:33:20.365 --> 00:33:21.265
ESTABLISH A.

00:33:21.332 --> 00:33:22.533
JOINT INSTITUTE FOR WOOD

00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:24.469
PRODUCTS INNOVATION WE HAVE

00:33:24.535 --> 00:33:26.204
INCREDIBLE CAPACITY IN OUR UC

00:33:26.270 --> 00:33:27.739
AND CSU AND.

00:33:27.805 --> 00:33:30.475
OTHER ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS TO.

00:33:30.541 --> 00:33:32.310
TO REALLY PUSH THE NEEDLE

ON AND WOOD PRODUCTS.

00:33:35.413 --> 00:33:36.881
ENGINEERING AND DESIGN AND.

00:33:36.948 --> 00:33:38.983
THOSE EFFORTS ARE ARE SOMEONE

00:33:39.050 --> 00:33:40.451
ONGOING RIGHT NOW ON THE IN THE

00:33:40.518 --> 00:33:41.819
IN THE INDIVIDUAL DEPARTMENTS

00:33:41.886 --> 00:33:43.388
AND DIVISIONS OF OUR UNIVERSITY

00:33:43.454 --> 00:33:44.222
SYSTEMS.

00:33:44.288 --> 00:33:46.591
THIS PROPOSAL WOULD BRING THOSE

00:33:46.657 --> 00:33:48.059
TOGETHER AND TRY TO CREATE AN

00:33:48.126 --> 00:33:49.160
INSTITUTE THAT COULD LEVERAGE

00:33:49.227 --> 00:33:50.628
BOTH THE.

00:33:50.695 --> 00:33:52.096
KIND OF TECHNICAL EXPERTISE

00:33:52.163 --> 00:33:53.264
AROUND DESIGNING THESE PRODUCTS

00:33:53.331 --> 00:33:54.766
BUT ALSO THE.

00:33:54.832 --> 00:33:56.501
THE KIND OF TESTING EXPERTISE

00:33:56.567 --> 00:33:58.469
AROUND ENGINEERING ARCHITECTURAL

00:33:58.536 --> 00:33:59.670
EARTHQUAKE.

00:33:59.737 --> 00:34:01.639
RESILIENCY AT CETERA.

00:34:01.706 --> 00:34:04.041
WE ARE LOOKING AT A IT'S AN

00:34:04.108 --> 00:34:05.877
ADOPTION OF A OF A NEW BUILDING

00:34:05.943 --> 00:34:07.779
CODE IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO I

00:34:07.845 --> 00:34:09.614
BELIEVE. THAT COULD EXPAND THE

00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:10.915
USE OF THESE ENGINEERED WOOD

00:34:10.982 --> 00:34:13.017
PRODUCTS TOO MUCH TALLER

00:34:13.084 --> 00:34:13.718
BUILDINGS AND ARE CURRENTLY

00:34:13.785 --> 00:34:15.920
ALLOWED SO THIS WOULD PUT US IN

00:34:15.987 --> 00:34:17.488
THE POSITION TO.

00:34:17.555 --> 00:34:19.457
LEVERAGE AND EXPERTISE TO.

00:34:19.524 --> 00:34:20.992
GET THOSE PRODUCTS RATING ALSO

00:34:21.058 --> 00:34:21.526
GET THAT INDUSTRY REDDING

00:34:21.592 --> 00:34:23.361
CALIFORNIA.

00:34:23.428 --> 00:34:23.795
BECAUSE IT IS IT IS.

00:34:23.861 --> 00:34:25.463
.

00:34:25.530 --> 00:34:27.031
BEING DEVELOPED ALONG THE WEST

00:34:27.098 --> 00:34:27.832
COAST IN OREGON AND WASHINGTON

00:34:27.899 --> 00:34:30.067
AS WELL. CAN AND YOU SAID THE.

00:34:30.134 --> 00:34:32.437
BUILDING CODE IS INTENDED TO GO

00:34:32.503 --> 00:34:34.172
INTO EFFECT.

00:34:34.238 --> 00:34:35.773
OF THE REVISIONS IN TWENTY

00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:37.208
TWENTY TWO THINGS TWENTY TWENTY

00:34:37.275 --> 00:34:38.743
IF I'M REMEMBERING WAS TWENTY

00:34:38.810 --> 00:34:39.710
TWENTY TWO WHEN THE

00:34:39.777 --> 00:34:41.045
INTERNATIONAL BUILDING CODES.

00:34:41.112 --> 00:34:42.747
WOULD COME INTO EFFECT AROUND

00:34:42.814 --> 00:34:45.016
MASS TIMBER SO THAT THE. THE THE

00:34:45.082 --> 00:34:46.651
STRUCTURAL BEAMS MADE OUT OF

00:34:46.717 --> 00:34:47.552
WOOD THAT COULD REPLACE

00:34:47.618 --> 00:34:49.353
STEEL BEAMS.

00:34:49.420 --> 00:34:51.222
THAT WOULD THAT WOULD BE

00:34:51.289 --> 00:34:52.023
ADOPTED IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND

00:34:52.089 --> 00:34:53.391
THEN.

00:34:53.458 --> 00:34:54.759
IT'S A STATE WE ADOPT THOSE

00:34:54.826 --> 00:34:56.928
INTERNATIONAL CODES.

00:34:56.994 --> 00:34:58.362
AND THAT'S FOR TALLER BUILDINGS

00:34:58.429 --> 00:35:01.165
IN THE CURRENT THRESHOLD.

00:35:01.232 --> 00:35:03.201
SELECT SOME PUT A PIN IN THAT

00:35:03.267 --> 00:35:03.701
BECAUSE I AT SOME.

00:35:05.470 --> 00:35:06.537
FUTURE POINT IN THE NEAR FUTURE

00:35:06.604 --> 00:35:08.606
I'D LIKE TO GET MORE INFORMATION

00:35:08.673 --> 00:35:11.142
WRITE LA UP ABOUT THAT.

00:35:11.209 --> 00:35:12.810
SO THE NEXT. BUT THAT SOUNDS

00:35:12.877 --> 00:35:14.011
GOOD IN THE NEXT PROPOSAL WAS

00:35:14.078 --> 00:35:15.646
FROM THE CINMATIC.

00:35:15.713 --> 00:35:16.814
SERMON SEEKING A BUILDING ON THE

00:35:16.881 --> 00:35:18.149
SAFETY OF THAT.

00:35:18.216 --> 00:35:18.382
WE HAVE.

00:35:18.449 --> 00:35:20.685
.

00:35:20.751 --> 00:35:22.153
CAPACITY IN OUR ROOM WORLD

00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:23.988
FORCED ECONOMIES TO BUILD THESE

00:35:24.055 --> 00:35:25.423
TYPES OF INDUSTRIES.

00:35:25.490 --> 00:35:27.091
IT'S ONE MILLION DOLLARS FROM

00:35:27.158 --> 00:35:29.193
THE TIMBER RESTORATION AND TEAR

00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:31.329
FOR FUND. AND IT IS INTENDED FOR

00:35:31.395 --> 00:35:33.030
GRANTS TO SUPPORT

00:35:33.097 --> 00:35:34.866
SPECIFICALLY SUPPORT. WOOD

00:35:34.932 --> 00:35:38.236
PRODUCTS MANUFACTURING CAPACITY

00:35:38.302 --> 00:35:40.671
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ENFORCED IT

00:35:40.738 --> 00:35:43.107
COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA SO

00:35:43.174 --> 00:35:44.976
THIS FUNDING IS IS IS REALLY

00:35:45.042 --> 00:35:47.211
MEANT TO DRIVE.

00:35:47.278 --> 00:35:49.647
YOU KNOW TO HELP THOSE PEOPLE

00:35:49.714 --> 00:35:52.216
TRYING TO DEVELOP THESE CAMPUSES

00:35:52.283 --> 00:35:54.752
AND REOPEN THEM WE OPEN MILLS.

00:35:54.819 --> 00:35:56.454
TOGETHER WILL HELP THEM GET TO

00:35:56.521 --> 00:35:57.688
THE BAY AREA FACING THE GET TO

00:35:57.755 --> 00:35:58.723
THOSE AMERICA.

00:35:58.789 --> 00:36:00.658
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE

00:36:00.725 --> 00:36:03.294
HEARING FROM MANY LOCALS ON THAT

00:36:03.361 --> 00:36:04.729
THEY NEED THEY NEED SUPPORT BUT

00:36:04.795 --> 00:36:06.364
THEY ALSO WITH THEY WILL ALSO

00:36:06.430 --> 00:36:07.565
NEED ALONG WITH FUNDING IS JUST

00:36:07.632 --> 00:36:08.833
HELP FROM OUR DEPARTMENTS IN

00:36:08.900 --> 00:36:10.368
GETTING THROUGH THE. IN THE MANY

00:36:10.434 --> 00:36:11.903
DIFFERENT REGULATORY AND.

00:36:11.969 --> 00:36:14.272
AND OTHER BARRIERS THAT WE CAN

00:36:14.338 --> 00:36:16.407
ASSIST THEM WITH.

00:36:16.474 --> 00:36:17.909
THEN THE FINAL PROPOSAL BACKED

00:36:17.975 --> 00:36:19.610
THE MASS TIMBER IS A IS A

00:36:19.677 --> 00:36:21.479
BUILDING COMPETITION THAT WE WE

00:36:21.546 --> 00:36:23.581
HONESTLY YOU KNOW COPY THIS IDEA

00:36:23.648 --> 00:36:25.583
FROM OREGON AND WASHINGTON. THEY

00:36:25.650 --> 00:36:27.718
CONDUCTED SIMILAR.

00:36:27.785 --> 00:36:28.886
OREGON I CAN'T REMEMBER

00:36:28.953 --> 00:36:31.088
WASHINGTON AND OREGON DID ONE.

00:36:31.155 --> 00:36:33.591
BUT THE IDEA IS THAT YOU IT IS

00:36:33.658 --> 00:36:35.526
VERY DIFFICULT TO PUSH FOR THESE

00:36:35.593 --> 00:36:37.562
MASS TIMBER. BUILDINGS AT THE

00:36:37.628 --> 00:36:39.463
LOCAL LEVEL AND BECAUSE LOCAL

00:36:39.530 --> 00:36:40.932
PERMITTING IS NOT ACCUSTOMED TO

00:36:40.998 --> 00:36:43.000
DEALING WITH. HAVE NEW WAYS TO

00:36:43.067 --> 00:36:44.502
BUILD BUILDINGS CITIES THESE

00:36:44.569 --> 00:36:45.603
FUNDS WOULD BE.

00:36:45.670 --> 00:36:48.072
DIRECTED PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN.

00:36:48.139 --> 00:36:50.007
LOCAL DEVELOPERS AND LOCAL

00:36:50.074 --> 00:36:52.209
GOVERNMENTS TO CAN OF SERVICE

00:36:52.276 --> 00:36:53.377
PILOT PROJECTS

00:36:53.444 --> 00:36:54.812
SHOWCASE HOW YOU CAN BUILD THESE

00:36:54.879 --> 00:36:56.180
BILLS BUILDINGS.

00:36:56.247 --> 00:36:57.748
WE'VE SEEN A FEW.

00:36:57.815 --> 00:36:59.584
BUILDINGS.

00:36:59.650 --> 00:37:01.018
GOING UP ACROSS STATE BUT

00:37:01.085 --> 00:37:02.620
RECENTLY PLUMAS COUNTY.

00:37:02.687 --> 00:37:04.555
CAN

00:37:04.622 --> 00:37:04.889
DESTRUCTIVE.

00:37:04.956 --> 00:37:06.257
AND IT WAS MAGIC TO THE

00:37:06.324 --> 00:37:07.792
COURTHOUSE BUT IT WAS.

00:37:07.858 --> 00:37:09.160
IT WAS NOT AN EASY UNDERTAKING

00:37:09.226 --> 00:37:10.795
AND IT'S NOT EASY TO CONVINCE

00:37:10.861 --> 00:37:12.063

ENGAGING.

00:38:03.614 --> 00:38:05.916
A FOREST MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE

00:38:05.983 --> 00:38:08.152
THAT WILL. ESSENTIALLY INVOLVE A

00:38:08.219 --> 00:38:09.787
A PIVOTING OF THE EXISTING TREE

00:38:09.854 --> 00:38:11.389
MORTALITY TASK FORCE THAT HAS

00:38:11.455 --> 00:38:13.024
BEEN EXTREMELY SUCCESSFUL. IN

00:38:13.090 --> 00:38:14.592
DEALING WITH THE CHALLENGES OF

00:38:14.659 --> 00:38:15.359
HUNDRED TWELVE TWENTY NINE

00:38:15.426 --> 00:38:16.994
MILLION. TREES DEAD IN THE

00:38:17.061 --> 00:38:18.329
CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN SIERRA

00:38:18.396 --> 00:38:20.264
PRIMARILY. UP BUT THE ISSUE IS

00:38:20.331 --> 00:38:22.333
OBVIOUSLY BROADER IT'S TAKING OF

00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:24.101
THE DEAD TREES ARE A SYMPTOM OF

00:38:24.168 --> 00:38:26.971
THIS BROADER FOREST HEALTH

00:38:27.038 --> 00:38:28.105
FOREST RESILIENCY.

00:38:28.172 --> 00:38:30.107
CHALLENGE WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA

00:38:30.174 --> 00:38:32.343
AND SO IT'S PART OF THE ROLL OUT

00:38:32.410 --> 00:38:34.478
LAST WEEK AND WE ARE WORKING

00:38:34.545 --> 00:38:36.013
TOWARDS PIVOTING THE TREE

00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:37.648
MORTALITY TASK FORCE.

00:38:37.715 --> 00:38:38.916
HERE IN THE COMING WEEKS TO A

00:38:38.983 --> 00:38:40.317
BROADER FOREST MANAGEMENT TASK

00:38:40.384 --> 00:38:41.819
FORCE THAT WILL ENCOMPASS.

00:38:41.886 --> 00:38:43.320

PLAN WELL AS WELL AS OTHER PLANS

00:38:46.857 --> 00:38:48.192
THE STATE'S OF STRATEGIC FIRE

00:38:48.259 --> 00:38:51.162
PLAN. ARE AND BRING AGENCIES AND

TOGETHER MEAN THAT TREE

00:38:53.064 --> 00:38:54.398
MORTALITY WILL STILL BE AN

00:38:54.465 --> 00:38:56.067
EMPHASIS WITHIN THIS BUT WILL BE

00:38:56.133 --> 00:38:57.501
A MUCH BROADER FOCUSING ON.

00:38:57.568 --> 00:38:59.804
MIA WOULD PRODUCTS MARKETING

THIS GOAL OF FIVE HUNDRED

00:39:05.142 --> 00:39:06.644
THOUSAND ACRES TREATED TO

00:39:06.711 --> 00:39:09.046
ANNUALLY ON PRIVATE LAND SO THAT

00:39:09.113 --> 00:39:09.547
WILL BE.

WHICH SHOWED EVEN SPENT A LOT

00:39:51.155 --> 00:39:53.023
OF TIME ON HIS HAS TO DO WITH

00:39:53.090 --> 00:39:54.492
REFORESTATION CORRECT.

00:39:54.558 --> 00:39:56.660
BOB CAN YOU JUST STOOD DESCRIBED

00:39:56.727 --> 00:39:58.829
WHAT IS.

00:39:58.896 --> 00:40:03.734
ENVISIONED.

00:40:03.801 --> 00:40:05.035
SO ARE AT SEVERAL THINGS ARE

00:40:05.102 --> 00:40:06.704
OBVIOUSLY REFORESTATION IS A

00:40:06.771 --> 00:40:07.838
BROADER COMPONENT.

00:40:07.905 --> 00:40:09.907
IT'S ONE OF THE MANY COMPONENTS

00:40:09.974 --> 00:40:11.475
IN IN TREATING OUR FORCE LANCE

00:40:11.542 --> 00:40:12.743
AND SO WE ONE.

00:40:12.810 --> 00:40:14.845
DUBBED HILLS RIGHT INTO A CAL

00:40:14.912 --> 00:40:17.648
FIRE RE ESTABLISHING OF THE

00:40:17.715 --> 00:40:19.984
DAVIS NURSERY TO GROW SEEDLINGS

00:40:20.050 --> 00:40:21.819
WE ARE REALLY TARGETING.

00:40:21.886 --> 00:40:23.454
THE OF THE.

00:40:23.521 --> 00:40:25.122
HERE ONE MILLION ACRES OF

00:40:25.189 --> 00:40:26.690
FOREST LAND IN THE STATE ALL

00:40:26.757 --> 00:40:28.526
LANDS COMBINED NINE MILLION

00:40:28.592 --> 00:40:30.694
ACRES OF THAT ARE SMALL. FAMILY

00:40:30.761 --> 00:40:33.097
FOREST LAND OWNERS OFFIFTY TO

00:40:33.164 --> 00:40:35.533
TWO HUNDRED ACRES IN SIZE. OUT

00:40:35.599 --> 00:40:37.034
WE ARE REALLY FOCUSING THIS

00:40:37.101 --> 00:40:39.470
EFFORT TO HELP SUPPORT CAPACITY.

00:40:39.537 --> 00:40:41.272
FOR THOSE LANDOWNERS TO BE ABLE

00:40:41.338 --> 00:40:42.773
TO REFOREST.

00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:44.909
AFTER THE INSECT AND DISEASE

00:40:44.975 --> 00:40:47.044
I'M CAUSE MORTALITY DEVASTATING

00:40:47.111 --> 00:40:49.380
FIRE O. OR LANDS THAT ARE JUST

00:40:49.446 --> 00:40:49.814
UNDER.

00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:52.316
FORESTED BECAUSE OVER TIME.

00:40:52.383 --> 00:40:54.451
THAT INVASIVE SPECIES AND OTHER.

00:40:54.518 --> 00:40:55.119
.

00:40:55.186 --> 00:40:56.387
SPECIES HAVE COMMANDED AND

00:40:56.453 --> 00:40:58.222
DISPLACED ACCOUNTED FORRISEN

00:40:58.289 --> 00:40:59.089
AND ANOTHER.

00:40:59.156 --> 00:41:01.091
TREE SPECIES AND SO THIS EFFORT

00:41:01.158 --> 00:41:02.359
WILL INCLUDE A VERY.

00:41:02.426 --> 00:41:04.728
EXTENSIVE AND ROBUST COMPONENT

00:41:04.795 --> 00:41:06.797
IN WORKING TOWARDS THAT WE FOR

00:41:06.864 --> 00:41:07.665
STING LANZA THROUGHOUT

00:41:07.731 --> 00:41:10.467
CALIFORNIA AND AS WE RESTORE FOR

00:41:10.534 --> 00:41:10.634
US.

00:41:10.701 --> 00:41:11.402
.

00:41:11.468 --> 00:41:14.672
I PRESUME THAT WERE OUT NOT ONLY

00:41:14.738 --> 00:41:15.239
LOOKING AT.

00:41:15.306 --> 00:41:17.441
VALUE OF FLAT CARBON

00:41:17.508 --> 00:41:18.909
SEQUESTRATION BUT ALSO.

00:41:18.976 --> 00:41:21.779
OF THE VALUE IN THAT.

00:41:21.846 --> 00:41:23.180
STORING WATER.

00:41:23.247 --> 00:41:25.349
THAT THEN GETS CLEANED AND

00:41:25.416 --> 00:41:28.219
CIRCULATE SO. YEAH A DOWN SO

00:41:28.285 --> 00:41:29.019
THAT THE CORRECT

00:41:29.253 --> 00:41:31.522
FORCE CARTON PLAN WAS.

00:41:31.589 --> 00:41:33.824
MAYBE MAYBE TO NARROW THE TITLE

00:41:33.891 --> 00:41:35.926
FOR THE PLAN BECAUSE THE FOCUS

00:41:35.993 --> 00:41:37.461
OF THE PLAN WAS REALLY TO.

00:41:37.528 --> 00:41:40.397
LOOK AT OUR FORCES ECOSYSTEM Y.

00:41:40.464 --> 00:41:42.499
SYSTEMS THAT WE WOULD YOU KNOW

00:41:42.566 --> 00:41:44.235
SEEK TO RESTORE TO ALL OF THE

00:41:44.301 --> 00:41:45.536
AND TO PROTECT ALL OF THE

00:41:45.603 --> 00:41:46.937
BENEFITS THAT WE DEPEND ON FROM

00:41:47.004 --> 00:41:49.607
US FOR SO. NOT ONLY THE CARBON

00:41:49.673 --> 00:41:50.875
SEQUESTRATION BUT.

00:41:50.941 --> 00:41:53.277
THE ECOSYSTEM THE HABITAT THE

00:41:53.344 --> 00:41:55.079
WATER YOU KNOW

00:41:55.145 --> 00:41:56.547
QUALITY AND WATER SUPPLY AND

00:41:56.614 --> 00:41:58.182
EVERYTHING ELSE THANK THANK YOU.

00:41:58.249 --> 00:42:00.651
YOU'RE DESCRIBING IT MUCH MORE

00:42:00.718 --> 00:42:01.986
ORPHALI THAN I DID. TIME.

00:42:02.052 --> 00:42:04.421
WHICH

00:42:04.488 --> 00:42:04.855
SHOULD BE THE CASE.

00:42:04.922 --> 00:42:07.157
.

00:42:07.224 --> 00:42:11.962
BUT TO OF THEM.

00:42:12.029 --> 00:42:13.264
THERE ARE ALL ARE ALL OF THOSE.

00:42:13.330 --> 00:42:15.332
AT BENEFITS AND INTENTIONS

00:42:15.399 --> 00:42:18.302
WRITTEN INTO THE PLAN YES.

00:42:18.369 --> 00:42:20.037
I'VE ARE THE OTHER THING I

00:42:20.104 --> 00:42:20.971
WANTED TO MENTION IS SOMETHING

00:42:21.038 --> 00:42:22.873
THAT I I REALLY WAS JUST A BRIEF

00:42:22.940 --> 00:42:25.276
DON. AS RECENTLY AS LAST FRIDAY

00:42:25.342 --> 00:42:27.811
BY A SOME SCIENTISTS AT UCLA.

00:42:27.878 --> 00:42:31.415
AND THAT IS THE ISSUE OF HOW WE

00:42:31.482 --> 00:42:34.251
THINK ABOUT. OUR RESTORATION OF

00:42:34.318 --> 00:42:35.286
FORCE

00:42:35.352 --> 00:42:38.756
OF ARE WE RESTORING FORESTS TO.

00:42:38.822 --> 00:42:40.758
.

00:42:40.824 --> 00:42:43.127
THE CONDITION THAT WE FOUND THE

00:42:43.193 --> 00:42:46.196
MEN TODAY ARE CONTEMPORANEOUSLY

00:42:46.263 --> 00:42:47.631
OR ARE WE LOOKING FORWARD.

00:42:47.698 --> 00:42:49.066
THROUGH THE LENS OF CLIMATE

00:42:49.133 --> 00:42:50.534
CHANGE.

00:42:50.601 --> 00:42:53.203
AND RESTORING FOREST SO THAT

00:42:53.270 --> 00:42:55.072
THEY WILL BE RESILIENT.

00:42:55.139 --> 00:42:56.640
TEN YEARS TWENTY YEARS AND FIFTY

00:42:56.707 --> 00:42:58.342
YEARS FROM NOW.

00:42:58.409 --> 00:42:59.677
IT'S VERY GOOD QUESTION AND WE

00:42:59.743 --> 00:43:00.844
ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO.

00:43:00.911 --> 00:43:02.947
THE FORESTS A OF TODAY OR

00:43:03.013 --> 00:43:04.515
YESTERDAY ARE NOT WHERE THEY

00:43:04.581 --> 00:43:05.416
WILL BE.

00:43:05.482 --> 00:43:06.951
TOMORROW AND SO WE ARE LOOKING

00:43:07.017 --> 00:43:08.485
AT THIS.

00:43:08.552 --> 00:43:09.253
AND IT WOULD WOULD NEVER BEEN

00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:11.388
CHALLENGED BY A HUNDRED TWENTY

00:43:11.455 --> 00:43:13.791
NINE MILLION TREES DYING.

00:43:13.857 --> 00:43:15.726
AND REALLY WHAT'S ONE EPISODE

00:43:15.793 --> 00:43:17.895
IT'S CHANGING THAT THE LANDSCAPE

00:43:17.962 --> 00:43:18.862
FOR THE CENTRAL.

00:43:18.929 --> 00:43:20.497
AND SOUTHERN SIERRA BUT IT'S

00:43:20.564 --> 00:43:22.166
REALLY STATEWIDE IMPACTS THAT

00:43:22.232 --> 00:43:24.234
WE'RE SEEING AND SO THIS

00:43:24.301 --> 00:43:25.602
INVOLVES LOOKING AT WHAT ARE THE

00:43:25.669 --> 00:43:28.072
APPROPRIATE TREE SPECIES.

00:43:28.138 --> 00:43:29.373
AND AND OTHER SHRUB AND PLANT

00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:32.443
SPECIES ARE AT ELEVATION AND

00:43:32.509 --> 00:43:33.310
LATITUDE THAT'S DIFFERENT GOING

00:43:33.377 --> 00:43:34.244
FORWARD AND THAT'S LOOKING AT

00:43:34.311 --> 00:43:35.679
CHANGING WEATHER PATTERNS

00:43:35.746 --> 00:43:37.781
TEMPERATURES ARE. LITERALLY THE

00:43:37.848 --> 00:43:39.149
CHANGING CLIMATE IS IMPACTING

00:43:39.216 --> 00:43:40.985
WHAT WILL GROW AT DIFFERENT

00:43:41.051 --> 00:43:42.319
ELEVATION AND IN DIFFERENT

00:43:42.386 --> 00:43:44.254
LOCATIONS AND SO IT'S TRYING TO

00:43:44.321 --> 00:43:45.889
MODEL WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE IN

AYE AYE AYE WHAT'S TALK A

00:44:40.577 --> 00:44:41.211
LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE.

00:44:41.278 --> 00:44:44.348
OF FORCED PRODUCT INNOVATION.

00:44:44.415 --> 00:44:47.518
OF A PROPOSAL WHICH I THINK IS

00:44:47.584 --> 00:44:49.219
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO US. AND

00:44:49.286 --> 00:44:51.522
WE CERTAINLY HAVE THE THE

00:44:51.588 --> 00:44:54.358
RESOURCES HERE FOR IMPLEMENTING

00:44:54.425 --> 00:44:56.827
AT A VERY ROBUST INNOVATIVE

00:44:56.894 --> 00:44:58.762
PROGRAM AND CALIFORNIA SHOULD BE

00:44:58.829 --> 00:45:00.230
ONE OF THE CENTERS.

00:45:00.297 --> 00:45:04.301
GIVEN THE THE AMOUNT OF FOR.

00:45:04.368 --> 00:45:07.304
THAT THE SIZEABLE FORCE THAT WE

00:45:07.371 --> 00:45:09.873
HAVE IN THE IN THE STATE.

00:45:09.940 --> 00:45:11.442
BUT IT OF STRIKES ME THAT.

00:45:11.508 --> 00:45:14.211
OF THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO

00:45:14.278 --> 00:45:15.312
CREATE.

00:45:15.379 --> 00:45:17.047
SOME NEW INDUSTRIES.

00:45:17.114 --> 00:45:19.149
THAT OUR OWN HOUSING AND

00:45:19.216 --> 00:45:20.184
BUILDING INDUSTRIES CAN TAKE

00:45:20.250 --> 00:45:22.152
ADVANTAGE OF ONE OF THE ISSUES

00:45:22.219 --> 00:45:23.987
THAT WE FACE IN THE HOUSING

00:45:24.054 --> 00:45:27.024
AFFORDABILITY CRISIS. IS THE

00:45:27.091 --> 00:45:27.958
EXTRAORDINARY COST OF

00:45:28.025 --> 00:45:29.593
CONSTRUCTION.

00:45:29.660 --> 00:45:30.761
TO BUILD A.

00:45:31.295 --> 00:45:33.931
AREA MULTI FAMILY HOUSING UNIT

00:45:33.997 --> 00:45:36.066
A SINGLE UNIT A IS COSTING

00:45:36.133 --> 00:45:36.967
SOMEWHERE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF

00:45:37.034 --> 00:45:38.268
FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND.

00:45:38.335 --> 00:45:39.837
IN SOME CASES.

00:45:39.903 --> 00:45:41.371
OVER SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND

00:45:41.438 --> 00:45:44.775
DOLLARS PER UNIT I'VE AND. UP

00:45:44.842 --> 00:45:46.176
PARTICULARLY WHEN IT COMES TO DE

00:45:46.243 --> 00:45:47.578
RESTRICTED HOUSING BUT REALLY

00:45:47.644 --> 00:45:50.214
ANY HOUSING THE HIGHER THE

00:45:50.280 --> 00:45:52.316
UNDERLYING COSTS ARE THE MORE

00:45:52.382 --> 00:45:54.318
PRESSURE THERE IS ON THAT ON

00:45:54.384 --> 00:45:59.456
RENTS AND TO. A PURCHASE PRICES.

00:45:59.523 --> 00:46:01.925
THERE IS AT THE SAME TIME THAT

00:46:01.992 --> 00:46:03.360
YOU'RE PROPOSING.

00:46:03.927 --> 00:46:06.096
A THE STUFF FORCE PRODUCT

00:46:06.163 --> 00:46:08.265
INNOVATIONS THERE'S ALSO A

00:46:08.332 --> 00:46:10.701
BUDDING INDUSTRY AND

00:46:10.767 --> 00:46:11.502
PREFABRICATED TO.

00:46:12.436 --> 00:46:15.239
UP PANELS OFFER HOUSING THIS

00:46:15.305 --> 00:46:18.142
ISN'T OLD STYLE PREFAB IT'S NEW

00:46:18.208 --> 00:46:20.444
AND INNOVATIVE AND I DON'T NEED

00:46:20.511 --> 00:46:22.379
TO GET INTO DETAILS HERE. BUT IT

00:46:22.446 --> 00:46:23.313
STRIKES ME THAT THERE'S AN

00:46:23.380 --> 00:46:26.750
OPPORTUNITY IN CALIFORNIA TO

00:46:26.817 --> 00:46:29.653
CREATE AN ENTIRELY NEW.

00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:31.255
INNOVATIVE INDUSTRY THAT WILL

00:46:31.321 --> 00:46:34.224
BENEFIT NOT ONLY OUR FORESTS BUT

00:46:34.291 --> 00:46:35.325
ARE HOUSING ISSUES.

00:46:35.392 --> 00:46:37.961
AND SO I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU AND

00:46:38.028 --> 00:46:39.763
SUGGEST THAT.

00:46:39.830 --> 00:46:42.666
YOU LOOK INTO THAT AND A

00:46:42.733 --> 00:46:45.068
COORDINATE THIS PROJECT AROUND

00:46:45.135 --> 00:46:48.172
THAT AS A A AS AN ULTIMATE GOAL

00:46:48.238 --> 00:46:49.206
ONE OF MANY GOALS BUT.

00:46:49.273 --> 00:46:51.108
ABOUT WHAT COULD BE A VERY

00:46:51.175 --> 00:46:54.378
IMPORTANT GOAL.

00:46:54.444 --> 00:46:55.145
AND NOW.

00:46:55.212 --> 00:46:56.280
IF THERE'S NO QUESTIONS FROM

00:46:56.346 --> 00:46:58.015
THE DICE.

00:46:58.081 --> 00:47:00.417
WE'LL HEAR FROM ALEJO. GREAT. I

00:47:00.484 --> 00:47:01.418
THINK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MONEY

00:47:01.485 --> 00:47:02.486
MEMBERS ACTUALLY ENDS WITH THE

00:47:02.553 --> 00:47:03.654
ANALYST'S OFFICE.

00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:06.690
I THINK WE.

00:47:06.757 --> 00:47:08.158
AGREE WITH A LOT OF THINGS THAT

00:47:08.225 --> 00:47:09.493
ARE EVEN SAID.

00:47:09.560 --> 00:47:11.395
WE ARE RECOMMENDING APPROVING

00:47:11.461 --> 00:47:13.197
MOST OF THE PROPOSAL WE. AGREE

00:47:13.263 --> 00:47:14.431
THAT BRIGHTENS OF THOSE EXIST

00:47:14.498 --> 00:47:15.832
ABOUT THE PROBLEMATIC CONDITIONS

00:47:15.899 --> 00:47:17.301
OF THE STATE'S FORESTS.

00:47:17.367 --> 00:47:18.735
IN THAT THE PACE AND SCALE HAVE

00:47:18.802 --> 00:47:20.771
NOT BEEN ENOUGH TO KEEP UP WITH

00:47:20.837 --> 00:47:21.939
THOSE PROBLEMS.

00:47:22.005 --> 00:47:23.907
WE ALSO FIND THAT THIS PROPOSAL

00:47:23.974 --> 00:47:25.475
HAS A LOT OF. ITEMS IN IT THAT

00:47:25.542 --> 00:47:26.109
ARE CONSISTENT WITH

00:47:26.176 --> 00:47:27.377
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE'VE MADE

00:47:27.444 --> 00:47:28.745
RECENTLY AND THE ANALYST'S

00:47:28.812 --> 00:47:30.113
REPORT REGARDING PERSON

00:47:30.180 --> 00:47:31.682
WATERSHED MANAGEMENT. AND THERE

00:47:31.748 --> 00:47:33.116
WAS ONE COMPONENT OF THE PACKAGE

00:47:33.183 --> 00:47:34.218
THAT WE DID HAVE SOME

00:47:34.284 --> 00:47:35.352
OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS ON AND

00:47:35.419 --> 00:47:36.987
THAT WAS THE TWENTY MILLION AND

00:47:37.054 --> 00:47:38.455
YOU ARE OF MONIES. A FOR

00:47:38.522 --> 00:47:40.490
RESOURCES AGENCY FOR THE

00:47:40.557 --> 00:47:42.426
REGIONAL FOREST HEALTH PROJECTS.

00:47:42.492 --> 00:47:44.061
ISN'T A REVIEW IT SEEMS LIKE

00:47:44.127 --> 00:47:45.996
ABOUT HER THE PROPOSAL JUST OR

00:47:46.063 --> 00:47:48.498
CONCEPTUAL PHASE RIGHT NOW AND

00:47:48.565 --> 00:47:48.999
DEMONSTRATION IS STILL

00:47:49.066 --> 00:47:50.133
DEVELOPING EXACTLY WHAT THAT

00:47:50.200 --> 00:47:50.801
WOULD LOOK LIKE AND HOW IT WOULD

00:47:50.867 --> 00:47:53.670
WORK. AND SO WE HAVE RECOMMENDED

00:47:53.737 --> 00:47:55.005
THE COMMITTEE MIGHT WANT TO

00:47:55.072 --> 00:47:56.006
CONSIDER ASKING SOME QUESTIONS

00:47:56.073 --> 00:47:57.374
OF THE ADMINISTRATION

INTO IT TO GO OUT AND WHICH WE

00:48:09.786 --> 00:48:12.389
START SEEING PROJECTS HAPPEN HOW

00:48:12.456 --> 00:48:12.990
MUCH OF THAT WOULD BE IN THE

APPROPRIATE FOR JDRF.

00:57:32.148 --> 00:57:34.851
THEY ALSO THE DEPARTMENT IS ALSO.

00:57:39.189 --> 00:57:40.857
DIAGRAM.

00:57:40.924 --> 00:57:42.625
SO.

00:57:42.692 --> 00:57:44.494
WHY?

00:57:44.561 --> 00:57:46.262

EITHER OF YOU CAN TAKE A STAB AT

00:57:51.935 --> 00:57:59.409

SO IF YOU LOOK AT THAT KIND OF

00:58:06.816 --> 00:58:08.585
THE MAY REVISION FRAMEWORK.

00:58:08.651 --> 00:58:12.155
THE ADMINISTRATION HAS A LOT OF

00:58:12.222 --> 00:58:14.324

01:04:39.008 --> 01:04:40.910

THOSE TRACTORS MAY NOT BE COST

01:04:58.995 --> 01:05:00.796
EFFECTIVE AND THEY MAY DECIDE

01:05:00.863 --> 01:05:01.897
THAT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO DO

01:05:01.964 --> 01:05:02.898
THAT BUSINESS ANYMORE JUST

01:05:02.965 --> 01:05:04.834
BECAUSE OF THE COST OF UPDATING

01:05:04.900 --> 01:05:05.768
THEIR EQUIPMENT.

01:05:05.835 --> 01:05:06.936

WITH THAT UNLESS THERE'S

01:18:28.637 --> 01:18:29.471

01:18:44.953 --> 01:18:45.987
WHERE WE'RE AT AS WE GO THROUGH

01:18:46.054 --> 01:18:47.989

PLUGGED INTO THAT. BUT OUR

01:19:01.937 --> 01:19:03.205
INTENTION GOING FORWARD IS TO

01:19:03.271 --> 01:19:05.173
SET UP AN EXECUTIVE STRUCTURE SO

THAT THE TWO AGENCIES CAN

COMMUNICATE ON A CONSISTENT

01:19:08.543 --> 01:19:10.445

BOTH OF OUR EFFORTS ARE

01:19:11.213 --> 01:19:16.618

ADMINISTRATION IS THAT E WE

01:29:28.062 --> 01:29:29.864
BELIEVE THAT IT FITS THE DEFEAT

01:29:29.931 --> 01:29:31.566
DEFINITION. BUT WE ARE

01:29:31.632 --> 01:29:32.767

TWO THIRDS VOTE.

01:29:49.584 --> 01:29:51.452
IF IT DOESN'T FIT A FEE IF IF IT

01:29:51.519 --> 01:29:52.787
NEEDS TO BE A TAX LIKE A THIRD

01:29:52.854 --> 01:29:54.522
IF PEOPLE CONCLUDED ATTACKS AND

01:29:54.589 --> 01:29:55.456
SUPPOSED TO FEEL THAT IT WOULD

01:29:55.523 --> 01:29:56.991

ABOUT THAT MATTER FOCUS OF SO

01:30:05.500 --> 01:30:07.702
IT'S STILL UNCLEAR.

01:30:07.769 --> 01:30:08.770
THERE'S STILL SOME CONVERSATIONS

01:30:08.836 --> 01:30:09.337

GETTING THEIR PROPOSAL PUT

01:30:16.077 --> 01:30:17.245
TOGETHER SO WE'RE TALKING TO

01:30:17.311 --> 01:30:18.279
OTHER STAKEHOLDERS TO MAKE SURE

THAT THEY AGREE AND WE GET

01:30:19.480 --> 01:30:21.182
CONSENSUS AROUND THAT SO THAT IN

01:30:21.249 --> 01:30:23.117

.

01:30:29.690 --> 01:30:31.959
CHARGE GET ASSESS.

01:30:32.026 --> 01:30:33.694
THE THE CONCEPT IS THE THE.

01:30:33.761 --> 01:30:36.397
THE STEWARDSHIP ENTITY ITSELF

01:30:36.464 --> 01:30:38.132
WHICH IS SOME MADE UP OF.

01:30:38.900 --> 01:30:40.268
THE MEMBERS OF THE FIREWORKS

01:30:40.334 --> 01:30:40.468
AND.

01:30:40.535 --> 01:30:43.871
INDUSTRY ASSESSES IT ITSELF.

01:30:43.938 --> 01:30:45.740
A FEE THAT IT DETERMINES IS

01:30:45.807 --> 01:30:48.342
APPROPRIATE TO TO REIMBURSE OUR

01:30:48.409 --> 01:30:49.477
COST TO.

01:30:49.544 --> 01:30:50.278
TO.

01:30:50.344 --> 01:30:52.346
IN TO CONDUCT FOR ENFORCEMENT

01:30:52.413 --> 01:30:53.381
PUBLIC EDUCATION AND AND

01:30:53.447 --> 01:30:54.615
DISPOSAL.

01:30:54.682 --> 01:30:56.717
SO THE THE REVENUES.

01:30:56.784 --> 01:30:58.152
FROM THE MANAGEMENT FEE.

01:30:58.219 --> 01:30:59.887
DO NOT COME TO THE STATE THEY

01:30:59.954 --> 01:31:01.255

01:31:01.322 --> 01:31:02.790
PROGRAM WHICH THEY ASSESS

01:31:02.857 --> 01:31:05.493
THEMSELVES.

01:31:05.560 --> 01:31:07.261
AND AND THEN THAT MONEY THEN WE

01:31:07.328 --> 01:31:09.897
GET GO TO REIMBURSE THE STATE.

01:31:09.964 --> 01:31:10.731
CORRECT OR ARE COSTS FOR.

01:31:10.798 --> 01:31:12.233
FIRED DEALING WITH ILLEGAL

01:31:12.300 --> 01:31:16.838
FIREWORKS ISSUE.

01:31:16.904 --> 01:31:18.206
DOES THE FEE SHOW UP IN THE

01:31:18.272 --> 01:31:19.640
POINT OF PURCHASE TRANSACTION

01:31:19.707 --> 01:31:20.608
WITH PEOPLE WHO BUY ILLEGAL

01:31:20.675 --> 01:31:23.177
FIREWORKS.

01:31:23.244 --> 01:31:24.545
THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING OF HOW

01:31:24.612 --> 01:31:27.481
WOULD WORK ISN'T THAT A TAX.

01:31:27.548 --> 01:31:28.916
I DON'T KNOW OUR INITIAL AS

01:31:28.983 --> 01:31:30.117
MISTER BENSON MENTION OUR

01:31:30.184 --> 01:31:31.619
INITIAL ASSESSMENT WAS SET.

01:31:31.686 --> 01:31:33.387
ASIDE THIS GENTLEMAN IS THE FIRE

01:31:33.454 --> 01:31:35.323
MARSHAL NOT DEAD LEGAL ANALYST

01:31:35.389 --> 01:31:37.225
IF EXCEPT I DON'T THINK IT'S

01:31:37.291 --> 01:31:40.094
QUITE A FAIR QUESTION TO ASK.

01:31:40.161 --> 01:31:41.696
CLUE MAKE CLUE YET ON THAT AND

01:31:41.762 --> 01:31:42.763
I'LL JUST REITERATE WHAT MISTER

01:31:42.830 --> 01:31:44.198
BENSON SAID IS IS THE IN OUR

01:31:44.265 --> 01:31:45.766
INITIAL ASSESSMENT AS WE SAT

01:31:45.833 --> 01:31:47.535
DOWN WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS. WAS

01:31:47.602 --> 01:31:49.637
AT THIS SUMMIT THE TO THE

01:31:49.704 --> 01:31:50.905
DEFINITION OF A OF A FEE.

01:31:50.972 --> 01:31:52.974
AND IF IT TURNS OUT THAT THAT'S

01:31:53.040 --> 01:31:54.642
NOT THE CASE THEN OBVIOUSLY WE

01:31:54.709 --> 01:31:55.977
WOULD WE WOULD GO THE

01:31:56.043 --> 01:31:58.179
APPROPRIATE ROUTE TO. ADDRESS IT.

01:31:58.246 --> 01:31:59.247
I AGAIN I.

01:31:59.313 --> 01:32:03.084
WASN'T.

01:32:03.150 --> 01:32:03.951
THAT I THINK PART OF OUR

01:32:04.018 --> 01:32:05.086
RESPONSIBILITY HERE IS TO FIND

01:32:05.152 --> 01:32:05.987

AT THE TRANSACTION IS IMPOSED ON

01:32:09.490 --> 01:32:10.958
A POINT OF SALE TO CONSUMERS OF

01:32:11.025 --> 01:32:12.727
LEGAL FIREWORKS IT SEEMS TO ME

01:32:12.793 --> 01:32:13.761
THAT IS A.

01:32:13.828 --> 01:32:15.596
SELF EVIDENT TAX.

01:32:15.663 --> 01:32:17.732
SO I I DID.

01:32:27.909 --> 01:32:29.143
ILLEGAL FIREWORKS IN CALIFORNIA

01:32:29.210 --> 01:32:31.145

01:32:31.212 --> 01:32:34.015
ALWAYS ILLEGAL IN OTHER STATES.

01:32:34.081 --> 01:32:36.651
IS THERE A COLLECTION.

01:32:36.717 --> 01:32:37.985
OF THOSE ILLEGAL CALIFORNIA FIRE

LEGAL FIREWORKS

01:32:51.866 --> 01:32:52.934
OTHER PLACES THAT ARE COLLECTED

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:54.735
IN CALIFORNIA ARE MANAGED TO

01:32:54.802 --> 01:32:56.671
HELP REDUCE THE LOAD.

01:32:56.737 --> 01:32:59.006
SO AT AT THIS MOMENT UNDER

01:32:59.073 --> 01:32:59.807
CURRENT LAW.

01:32:59.874 --> 01:33:02.176
ALL FIREWORKS THAT ARE SEIZED

01:33:02.243 --> 01:33:02.643
BY.

01:33:02.710 --> 01:33:04.612
ANYBODY WHETHER IT'S LOCAL FIRE.

OR LAW ENFORCEMENT OR OR THE

01:33:07.281 --> 01:33:08.816
STATE. THAT IS CONSIDERED A

01:33:08.883 --> 01:33:10.618
HAZARDOUS WASTE AND THEREFORE

01:33:10.685 --> 01:33:11.886

HELICOPTERS OVERHEAD ITSELF FOR

01:42:07.588 --> 01:42:08.889
ERA TIME FRAMES THAT RIGHT.

01:42:08.956 --> 01:42:11.625
SO THAT WILL A COMPLETELY OF

01:42:11.692 --> 01:42:13.427
REPLACE THE CURRENT VIETNAM.

01:42:13.494 --> 01:42:16.196
OF VINTAGE HELICOPTERS THAT ARE

01:42:16.263 --> 01:42:17.798
RUNNING OUT OF SPARE PARTS.

01:42:17.865 --> 01:42:19.500
AND THEY CAN'T FLY AT NIGHT

01:42:19.566 --> 01:42:21.935
HAVE OTHER LIMITATIONS AND THE

01:42:22.002 --> 01:42:23.470
THAT WILL SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCE

01:42:23.537 --> 01:42:25.739
OUR ABILITY TO. FIGHT FIRES IN

01:42:25.806 --> 01:42:26.740
THE STATE MISTER PATTERSON

01:42:26.807 --> 01:42:28.208
ADVOCATE PIGGYBACK ON THAT.

01:42:28.275 --> 01:42:29.443
.

01:42:29.510 --> 01:42:30.444
THE SOONER THE BETTER WE WE WE

01:42:30.511 --> 01:42:32.012
GET THAT AIR FLEET.

01:42:32.079 --> 01:42:32.880
MODERNIZED OBVIOUSLY.

01:42:32.946 --> 01:42:34.882
I'M.

01:42:34.948 --> 01:42:36.783
WOULD THESE.

01:42:36.850 --> 01:42:37.818
BEN AND THE OTHER THING IS THE

HELICOPTER YOU CHOSE.

01:42:39.186 --> 01:42:43.357
IS A SUPERB MACHINE.

01:42:43.423 --> 01:42:45.692
I'M ARE WITH RESPECT TO. WILL

01:42:45.759 --> 01:42:47.160
THE WILL THESE ASSETS BE.

IN IN IN NEW OR DIFFERENT WAYS

01:42:52.332 --> 01:42:53.567
GIVEN THE STUD SORT OF THE NEW

01:42:53.634 --> 01:42:55.602
REALITY OF OF OUR FIRES WHERE

01:42:55.669 --> 01:42:56.703
WHERE WILL THEY BE STATIONED AT

01:42:56.770 --> 01:42:57.804
HOW WILL THEY BE.

01:42:57.871 --> 01:43:00.173
PRE POSITIONED IT IN AN EFFORT.

01:43:00.240 --> 01:43:01.275
TO GET UP IN THE AIR QUICKLY AND

01:43:01.341 --> 01:43:03.443
GET TO THE FIRES.

01:43:03.510 --> 01:43:04.011
CLOSE PROXIMITY WITH THE AIR

01:43:04.077 --> 01:43:05.712
POWER.

01:43:05.779 --> 01:43:07.748
VERY GOOD QUESTION I'M HELLFIRE

01:43:07.814 --> 01:43:08.715
HAS AN EXISTING TEN.

01:43:08.782 --> 01:43:10.751
HELLA TECH BASIS SPREAD ACROSS

01:43:10.817 --> 01:43:12.286
CALIFORNIA NEAR VERY STRATEGIC

01:43:12.352 --> 01:43:13.720
AND WHERE THEY REPLACED

01:43:13.787 --> 01:43:15.122
ORIGINALLY BASED ON THAT THE U.

01:43:15.188 --> 01:43:17.324
H. WHEN HUEY'S. UP YOUR INTENT

01:43:17.391 --> 01:43:18.725
IS TO PUT THEM IN THOSE

01:43:18.792 --> 01:43:19.359
LOCATIONS BUT THEY'VE BEEN VERY

01:43:19.426 --> 01:43:21.128
EFFECTIVE BUT CERTAINLY WITH

01:43:21.194 --> 01:43:22.930
THIS NEW A PLATFORMER CONTINUE

01:43:22.996 --> 01:43:24.197
TO REEVALUATE.

01:43:24.264 --> 01:43:26.033
WE HAVEN'T YOU HAD THIS

01:43:26.099 --> 01:43:27.267
PLATFORM BEFORE IT WAS IT WAS A

01:43:27.334 --> 01:43:29.202
GREAT OPPORTUNITY WITH YOU KNOW

01:43:29.269 --> 01:43:31.204
MAYBE FASTER FLIGHT TIMES IN

01:43:31.271 --> 01:43:32.339
DIFFERENT CAPACITIES. THAT WERE

01:43:32.406 --> 01:43:33.373
ABLE TO MAYBE LOOK AT SOME OF

01:43:33.440 --> 01:43:35.342
THAT BUT IT BUT WE HAVE TEN VERY

01:43:35.409 --> 01:43:37.010
EFFECTIVE TELETECH BASES WILL BE

01:43:37.077 --> 01:43:38.412
LOOKING AT UPGRADES TO THOSE.

01:43:38.478 --> 01:43:39.479
THROUGH THE CAPITAL OUTLAY

01:43:39.546 --> 01:43:42.082
PROCESS UP BUT WE ARE VERY

01:43:42.149 --> 01:43:44.618
EXCITED ABOUT MOVING FORWARD.

01:43:44.685 --> 01:43:46.720
WITH IMPLEMENTING ND AS WE

01:43:46.787 --> 01:43:48.388
SPEAK WE'RE PREPARING THAT TO

01:43:48.455 --> 01:43:49.389
MAKE THE FIRST REQUIREMENT

01:43:49.456 --> 01:43:50.724
BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW WE ARE

01:43:50.791 --> 01:43:51.191
BUDGETED.

01:43:51.258 --> 01:43:53.226
IN THE CURRENT. YEAR AFTER THAT

01:43:53.293 --> 01:43:54.695
FIRST PLATFORM AND SO WE'RE VERY

01:43:54.761 --> 01:43:56.396
EXCITED TO BE MOVING FORWARD AS

01:43:56.463 --> 01:43:58.465
WE STUDY. THAT SO THAT THERE IS

01:43:58.532 --> 01:43:59.800
THEY'VE THERE WILL BE OVER TIME

01:43:59.866 --> 01:44:04.638
A. CONSIDERATION OF PERHAPS

01:44:04.705 --> 01:44:05.339
REPOSITIONING.

01:44:05.405 --> 01:44:06.673
A IF

01:44:06.740 --> 01:44:07.874
THE BUT FOR EXAMPLE IF IF IF

01:44:07.941 --> 01:44:10.010
URBAN AREAS ARE IN MUCH MORE.

01:44:10.077 --> 01:44:10.944
SIGNIFICANT.

01:44:11.011 --> 01:44:11.778
DANGER.

01:44:11.845 --> 01:44:13.847
.

01:44:13.914 --> 01:44:16.016
WHAT WOULD THERE BE OTHER?

01:44:16.083 --> 01:44:18.218
MORE URBAN OUR CLOSE PROXIMITY.

01:44:18.285 --> 01:44:19.920

AT AIRPORTS.

01:44:20.754 --> 01:44:22.889
.

01:44:22.956 --> 01:44:25.158
TO PLACE THEM I I THOUGHT I

01:44:25.225 --> 01:44:26.593
HEARD YOU SAY THAT THAT'S A THAT.

01:44:26.660 --> 01:44:27.761
YOU'RE GOING TO BE LOOKING AT

01:44:27.828 --> 01:44:29.296
THE POSSIBILITY OF.

01:44:29.363 --> 01:44:30.831
OF POSITIONING WITH RESPECT TO

01:44:30.897 --> 01:44:33.166
THE NEW CHALLENGES THAT WE AND

01:44:33.233 --> 01:44:34.601
THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT THE NEW.

01:44:34.668 --> 01:44:36.269
PLATFORM PROVIDES IT WHAT WERE

01:44:36.336 --> 01:44:37.904
ALWAYS EVALUATING NOT JUST WHERE

ALL OF OUR ASSETS ARE AS. WELL.

01:44:42.776 --> 01:44:44.645
URBANIZATION CHANGES AS FIRE

01:44:44.711 --> 01:44:45.946
THREATENING MISSION DENSITY

01:44:46.013 --> 01:44:48.815
CHANGE WERE ALWAYS REEVALUATING.

01:44:48.882 --> 01:44:50.017

WITH THE HELICOPTERS AS WELL

01:44:54.287 --> 01:44:55.689

01:44:55.756 --> 01:44:57.491
GOT TEN VERY EFFECTIVE. HOW

01:44:57.557 --> 01:44:59.159
ATTACK BASES IN IT WILL CONTINUE

01:44:59.226 --> 01:45:00.360
TO TO UTILIZE THOSE BUT

01:45:00.427 --> 01:45:02.629
REEVALUATE BUT AS WE GO FORWARD

01:45:02.696 --> 01:45:03.830

THINGS WITH WHICH THEY BECAUSE I

01:45:09.870 --> 01:45:10.837

01:45:14.975 --> 01:45:15.542
FACT THERE SPEEDIER QUICKER WITH

01:45:15.609 --> 01:45:15.942
HIGHER.

01:45:16.009 --> 01:45:16.977
CAPACITY SO THERE THERE'S A WAY

01:45:17.044 --> 01:45:18.412
FOR POSITIONING TO BE AS

01:45:18.478 --> 01:45:18.979

EFFORT THAT'S BEEN HAPPENING FOR

01:49:12.312 --> 01:49:14.281
YEARS OVER MANY YEARS THERE WAS

01:49:14.347 --> 01:49:15.115

A ON LOCATION FOR A NEW MUSEUM

01:49:31.498 --> 01:49:32.966

IT.

01:50:06.633 --> 01:50:09.469
IS IS IS CONSIDERED KIND OF A

01:50:09.536 --> 01:50:11.137
CULTURALLY INSENSITIVE TO LOCATE

01:50:11.204 --> 01:50:13.606
IT THERE ALONGSIDE CENTERS FOR.

01:50:13.673 --> 01:50:16.443

AND MOST OF THEM SET THERE

01:50:27.554 --> 01:50:28.855
WITHOUT THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE

01:50:28.922 --> 01:50:30.623
ENJOYED BY THE PUBLIC.

01:50:30.690 --> 01:50:32.726

THE LOCATION NOW NOT ONLY IS IT

01:50:37.530 --> 01:50:39.132
ANTIQUATED BUT IT'S VERY SMALL

01:50:39.199 --> 01:50:40.867
SO WERE ONLY ABLE TO REALLY PUT

01:50:40.934 --> 01:50:42.535
ON DISPLAY A VERY VERY SMALL

01:50:42.602 --> 01:50:44.170
PORTION. OF WHAT.

YEAH AND WE HAVE TWO MAJOR

01:50:52.412 --> 01:50:54.681
CONCERNS WITH THIS PROPOSAL OF

01:50:54.748 --> 01:50:55.482
THE FIRST OF WHICH IS.

01:50:55.548 --> 01:50:58.184
IT'S UNCLEAR THAT THE TWO ARE

01:50:58.251 --> 01:50:59.386
MILLION COST ESTIMATE IS.

01:50:59.452 --> 01:51:01.354
ACCURATE OF I KNOW THAT THERE

01:51:01.421 --> 01:51:03.356
HAVE BEEN SOME STUDIES DONE

01:51:03.423 --> 01:51:03.923
MOVED DIRECTOR REFERENCED.

01:51:03.990 --> 01:51:05.525
BUT. TWO THOUSAND AND TWO WAS

01:51:05.592 --> 01:51:06.860
QUITE AWHILE AGO.

01:51:06.926 --> 01:51:08.728
AND SAYS YOU LIKE OVERLOOKING

01:51:08.795 --> 01:51:09.496
ANNOUNCED OF HIS LITTLE

01:51:09.562 --> 01:51:11.197
CONCEPTUAL WE HAVEN'T SEEN A LOT

01:51:11.264 --> 01:51:12.265
OF DETAILS ABOUT IT.

01:51:12.332 --> 01:51:13.900
SO THEY'RE NOT THAT TO HER

01:51:13.967 --> 01:51:15.502
MILLION DOLLAR AMOUNT IS RIGHT

01:51:15.568 --> 01:51:17.037
AND THEN SECONDLY THAT.

01:51:17.103 --> 01:51:19.105
BY PROVING THAT THE TRAILER

01:51:19.172 --> 01:51:20.306
BILL LANGUAGE OF THAT IS

01:51:20.373 --> 01:51:21.674
CURRENTLY PROPOSED I WOULD

01:51:21.741 --> 01:51:23.676
AUTHORIZE ALL OF THE FUNDING AT

01:51:23.743 --> 01:51:24.444
ONCE.

01:51:24.511 --> 01:51:25.979
BUT YOU KNOW THAT'S DIFFERENT

01:51:26.046 --> 01:51:26.613
FROM THE NORMAL CAPITAL OUTLAY

01:51:26.679 --> 01:51:29.082
PROCESS WHERE YOU SEE A PROPOSAL

01:51:29.149 --> 01:51:30.417
FOR FUNDING AT EACH STAGE DURING

01:51:30.483 --> 01:51:32.886
THE PROCESS. OF AND SO WE THINK

01:51:32.952 --> 01:51:34.120
IT REMOVES A CERTAIN LEVEL

01:51:34.187 --> 01:51:37.390
LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT FOR A

01:51:37.457 --> 01:51:38.058
PRETTY SIGNIFICANT DOLLAR AMOUNT.

01:51:38.124 --> 01:51:39.392
.

01:51:39.459 --> 01:51:41.895
SO WE THINK THAT IF YOU DO WANT

01:51:41.961 --> 01:51:43.163
TO. MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS

01:51:43.229 --> 01:51:44.297
PROJECT THAT WOULD MAYBE MAKE

01:51:44.364 --> 01:51:45.765
MORE SENSE TO JUST FIND WHAT'S

01:51:45.832 --> 01:51:47.767
NEEDED IN THE BUDGET YEAR.

01:51:47.834 --> 01:51:49.569
FOR SOME OF THE INITIAL PHASES

01:51:49.636 --> 01:51:50.837
OF THE PROJECT.

01:51:50.904 --> 01:51:52.439
IF YOU WANT TO CHOOSE A SET

01:51:52.505 --> 01:51:53.907
ASIDE SOME ADDITIONAL FUNDS FOR

01:51:53.973 --> 01:51:54.240
THE PROJECT.

01:51:54.307 --> 01:51:56.109
YOUR HOPE OF SOME OF THE

01:51:56.176 --> 01:51:57.510
FUNDRAISING THAT THEY MENTIONED.

01:51:57.577 --> 01:51:59.145
A MEAL YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO

01:51:59.212 --> 01:52:00.814
STILL MOVE OVER IN TO THE

01:52:00.880 --> 01:52:02.415
SPECIAL FUND.

01:52:02.482 --> 01:52:04.851
WE JUST THINK. IF YOU MOVE IT

01:52:04.918 --> 01:52:06.252
OVER YOU SHOULD AUTHORIZES.

01:52:06.319 --> 01:52:09.355

01:52:09.422 --> 01:52:10.290
.

01:52:10.356 --> 01:52:11.591
SO THEY CAN CONTINUE TO OVERSEE

01:52:11.658 --> 01:52:13.960
THIS AS IT DEVELOPS.

BUT YOUR IS YOUR CONCERN THAT

01:57:37.850 --> 01:57:40.019
THE OVERALL COST MAY EXCEED TWO

01:57:40.086 --> 01:57:42.188
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS.

OVER THAT NOW WHAT THE FINAL

01:57:45.892 --> 01:57:47.527
PRICE TAG.

01:57:47.593 --> 01:57:49.362
WOULD BE YEAH I THINK MORE OF

01:57:49.429 --> 01:57:50.730
OUR CONCERN WAS WAS JUST BAD YOU

01:57:50.797 --> 01:57:52.799
KNOW IT'S IT'S BASED ON SOME

01:57:52.865 --> 01:57:54.100
SOME REPORTS THAT WERE OLDER AND

01:57:54.167 --> 01:57:54.967
WE JUST DON'T HAVE A LOT OF

01:57:55.034 --> 01:57:57.537
DETAILS ON EXACTLY WHAT THIS.

01:57:57.603 --> 01:57:58.538
PROJECT WOULD LOOK LIKE.

01:57:58.604 --> 01:58:00.339
YOU TYPICALLY WE WOULD SEE

01:58:00.406 --> 01:58:02.375
PROJECTS AND PHASES THROUGH THE

01:58:02.442 --> 01:58:03.910
BUDGET PROCESS IS THE COMEBACK

01:58:03.976 --> 01:58:05.178
WITH THE DESIGN PHASES

01:58:05.244 --> 01:58:06.679
EMPLOYMENT OF XTERRA.

01:58:06.746 --> 01:58:09.015
BECAUSE THIS IS STILL KIND OF

01:58:09.081 --> 01:58:10.583
THE OUTFIT WE JUST.

01:58:10.650 --> 01:58:11.584
DON'T HAVE THAT AND SO IT'S A

01:58:11.651 --> 01:58:13.786
LITTLE BIT UNCLEAR IF TO UNDER

01:58:13.853 --> 01:58:14.554
MILLION IS IS THE RIGHT.

01:58:14.620 --> 01:58:16.989
AMOUNT.

01:58:17.056 --> 01:58:17.190
YEAH.

01:58:17.256 --> 01:58:19.759
.

01:58:19.826 --> 01:58:21.027
RIGHT BRAIN DO ANYTHING THAT WE

01:58:21.093 --> 01:58:22.395
HAVE A QUESTION AS STATE PARK

01:58:22.462 --> 01:58:23.429
SELECTED RESPONDED THAT.

01:58:25.064 --> 01:58:25.998
IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WE DID A.

01:58:26.065 --> 01:58:28.868
FAIRLY COMPREHENSIVE STUDY

01:58:28.935 --> 01:58:30.736
INCLUDES A DETAILED ESTIMATES.

01:58:30.803 --> 01:58:33.406
FLOOR PLANS AND AREAS AND SET

01:58:33.473 --> 01:58:34.507
SUCH FOR THAT FOR THE BUILDING

01:58:34.574 --> 01:58:36.242
SO. WHEN WE SAY THIS IS

01:58:36.309 --> 01:58:36.542
CONCEPTUAL.

01:58:36.609 --> 01:58:37.877
.

01:58:37.944 --> 01:58:39.345
THE IDEA IS IS WE HAVE SOME

01:58:39.412 --> 01:58:42.081
COMMUNITY OUT OF REACH TO FINE

01:58:42.148 --> 01:58:43.182
TUNE THE SCOPE BUT THE MAN TO

01:58:43.249 --> 01:58:44.450
THE PROJECT IS DONE.

01:58:44.517 --> 01:58:45.751
THAT'S GOING TO CHANGE THE THE

01:58:45.818 --> 01:58:47.753
OPPOSITION THE CONFIGURATION OF

01:58:47.820 --> 01:58:49.055
THE BUILDINGS THE PROGRAM AREAS

01:58:49.121 --> 01:58:50.389
BETWEEN THE BUILDINGS MAY SHIFT

01:58:50.456 --> 01:58:52.925
SLIGHTLY. BUT THE THE CONCEPT.

01:58:52.992 --> 01:58:54.026
REMAINS.

01:58:54.093 --> 01:58:56.429
VERY VERY FIRM IN AND VERY

01:58:56.496 --> 01:58:56.829
DETAILED.

01:58:56.896 --> 01:58:59.298
AS FAR AS THE COST THE COST

01:58:59.365 --> 01:59:00.533
REDUNDANT TWO THOUSAND EIGHT.

01:59:00.600 --> 01:59:02.101
WE BASICALLY THOSE TO TODAY'S

01:59:02.168 --> 01:59:03.736
DOLLARS AND THEN PROJECT IS

01:59:03.803 --> 01:59:05.571
ABOUT TO START CONSTRUCTION FIVE

01:59:05.638 --> 01:59:06.606
YEARS FROM NOW SO WE'RE WE'RE

01:59:06.672 --> 01:59:08.407
VERY CONFIDENT THAT THE. AMOUNT

01:59:08.474 --> 01:59:10.076
OF FIVE FUNDING IS SUFFICIENT TO

01:59:10.142 --> 01:59:11.777
ACCOMPLISH THE SCOPE THAT'S A

01:59:11.844 --> 01:59:12.578
CONTAINED IN THIS IN THIS IN

01:59:12.645 --> 01:59:14.013
THIS DOCUMENT. SO WE DO WE DO

01:59:14.080 --> 01:59:15.448
LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH AND

01:59:15.515 --> 01:59:16.916
TRAVEL COUPLE GROUPS AND OTHER

01:59:16.983 --> 01:59:19.085
STAKEHOLDERS TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:59:19.151 --> 01:59:20.853
THE FINAL PLAN REFLECTS OUR

01:59:20.920 --> 01:59:23.222
STATEWIDE VISION AND. AND A

01:59:23.289 --> 01:59:24.056
PRIORITIES.

01:59:24.123 --> 01:59:27.193
SO WE DON'T HAVE A A FIXED IDEA

01:59:27.260 --> 01:59:27.927
OF EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE GONNA

01:59:27.994 --> 01:59:30.296
BUILD BUT IT'S VERY SOLID AND WE

01:59:30.363 --> 01:59:32.131
LOOK FOR THE WORKING FOLKS TO

01:59:32.198 --> 01:59:34.267
FINE TUNE A FURTHER.

01:59:34.333 --> 01:59:36.435
I'VE. I'VE MISSED PATTERSON NOT

01:59:37.837 --> 01:59:39.272
MAKE MY POINT.

01:59:39.338 --> 01:59:40.540
NOTWITHSTANDING THE CONCERNS

01:59:40.606 --> 01:59:41.407
RAISED IN THE AND THE CHAIRS

01:59:41.474 --> 01:59:43.209
CONCERNS.

01:59:43.276 --> 01:59:44.977
CERTAINLY THERE IS A PATHWAY

01:59:45.044 --> 01:59:46.579
HERE TO GET THIS PUT TOGETHER SO

01:59:46.646 --> 01:59:48.080
THAT IT COMES BACK TO US PRETTY

01:59:48.147 --> 01:59:50.149

WANT TO I WANT TO VOTE FOR THIS.

01:59:52.051 --> 01:59:54.086
SO WHAT WHAT OF THAT. WHAT KINDS

THE P. APPARENT.

02:00:03.763 --> 02:00:09.602
UNCERTAINTIES.

02:00:09.669 --> 02:00:11.571
FIVE QUESTION YEAH I THINK

02:00:11.637 --> 02:00:13.806
EARLIER YES WE'RE JUST CONCERNED.

02:00:13.873 --> 02:00:15.207
THE OUT WITH WITH THE LACK OF

02:00:15.274 --> 02:00:16.909
OVERSIGHT IF WE AUTHORIZE ALL

02:00:16.976 --> 02:00:17.977
THIS AT ONCE SO.

02:00:18.044 --> 02:00:20.012
YOU KNOW OUR RECOMMENDATION WAS

02:00:20.079 --> 02:00:21.647
CONSIDERED JUST AUTHORIZING WITH

02:00:21.714 --> 02:00:23.316
NEEDED IN THE BUDGET YEAR OUGHT

02:00:23.382 --> 02:00:24.717
TO KEEP IT MOVING FORWARD AND

02:00:24.784 --> 02:00:26.519
THEN.

02:00:26.586 --> 02:00:29.188
HAVE THEM COME BACK NEXT.

02:00:29.255 --> 02:00:30.289
IN THE SAME WAY THAT HE WOULD

02:00:30.356 --> 02:00:31.324
FOUR FOR A TYPICAL CAPITAL

02:00:31.390 --> 02:00:33.492
OUTLAY POSTION.

02:00:33.559 --> 02:00:35.294
PROCESS FOR IT BENEFIT AND ARE

02:00:35.361 --> 02:00:36.429
YOU ARE YOU SAYING THAT.

02:00:36.495 --> 02:00:38.431
THE MONEY UP FRONT.

02:00:38.497 --> 02:00:39.865
YOU'RE WELL PREPARED TO TAKE IT

02:00:39.932 --> 02:00:42.034
AND GET IT OUT AND CONSTRUCTIVE

02:00:42.101 --> 02:00:43.736
QUICKLY.

02:00:43.803 --> 02:00:44.904
IT'S I DON'T WHAT WHAT WOULD

02:00:44.971 --> 02:00:48.140
PARTIALLY IT OUT SLOW YOU DOWN.

02:00:48.207 --> 02:00:48.774
SO ASSEMBLY MEMBER MISTER CHAIR

02:00:48.841 --> 02:00:49.875
I THINK.

02:00:49.942 --> 02:00:51.177
WHAT WHAT I HEAR IS THAT THERE'S

02:00:51.243 --> 02:00:53.145
COLLECTIVE IN SPIRIT SUPPORT FOR

02:00:53.212 --> 02:00:54.981
THIS PROJECT IT WAS NEVER OUR

02:00:55.047 --> 02:00:57.450
INTENT IN CRAFTING IN THIS

02:00:57.516 --> 02:00:59.518
MANNER TO SOMEHOW ON DIMINISH

02:00:59.585 --> 02:01:01.020
OUR LESSONS LEGISLATIVE

02:01:01.087 --> 02:01:02.288
OVERSIGHT? SO I THINK IF YOU

02:01:02.355 --> 02:01:03.489
GIVE US A CHANCE TO GO BACK

02:01:03.556 --> 02:01:05.524
SPEND A LITTLE MORE TIME WITH

02:01:05.591 --> 02:01:07.059
THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE.

02:01:07.126 --> 02:01:09.895
I CAN TELL YOU THAT IT'S NOT

02:01:09.962 --> 02:01:11.864
UNPRECEDENTED IN THE STATE THAT

02:01:11.931 --> 02:01:14.233
WE WOULD APPROPRIATE ALL OF THE

02:01:14.300 --> 02:01:15.935
FUNDING UP FRONT I'M WITH

I HAD TWO THOUSAND EIGHT IS ALL

02:02:14.560 --> 02:02:16.395
IS A DECADE AGO OF THE

02:02:16.462 --> 02:02:19.665
TECHNOLOGY THAT IS UTILIZED AND.

02:02:19.732 --> 02:02:21.834
FACILITIES LIST NATURE HAS

02:02:21.901 --> 02:02:22.902
CHANGED DRAMATICALLY EVEN IN THE

02:02:22.968 --> 02:02:24.036
LAST

02:02:24.103 --> 02:02:26.772
DECADE AND I HOPE THAT.

02:02:27.406 --> 02:02:31.777
WE ARE LOOKING AT A FACILITY AT

02:02:31.844 --> 02:02:33.345
EIGHT HERITAGE CENTER THAT WILL

02:02:33.412 --> 02:02:35.047
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ALL OF THE

02:02:35.114 --> 02:02:36.849
GREAT TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE OUT

02:02:36.916 --> 02:02:38.184

ULTIMATELY BUILDING OUT A WORLD

02:02:51.864 --> 02:02:53.566
CLASS.

02:02:53.632 --> 02:02:56.736
A HERITAGE CENTER THAT WILL BE.

02:02:57.570 --> 02:02:59.839
LOOK TO AROUND THE WORLD AT

02:02:59.905 --> 02:03:00.573

THE INTENT IS THAT WITH THIS

02:03:04.443 --> 02:03:06.112
PROJECT.

02:03:06.178 --> 02:03:07.346
ON END WITH PARDONING WITH THE

02:03:07.413 --> 02:03:09.014
TRIBAL COMMUNITY IT'S NOT JUST

02:03:09.081 --> 02:03:10.516
FROM THE PHILANTHROPIC SUPPORT

02:03:10.583 --> 02:03:12.284
ASPECT BUT ALSO THAT WILL BE

02:03:12.351 --> 02:03:13.652
PARTNERING WITH THE TRIBAL

02:03:13.719 --> 02:03:15.020
COMMUNITIES IN DESIGNING THE

02:03:15.087 --> 02:03:16.756
INTERPRETIVE PROGRAMS.

02:03:16.822 --> 02:03:17.790
AND FOR THE FIRST TIME IT'S

02:03:17.857 --> 02:03:19.625
REALLY ALLOWING US TO HAVE A

02:03:19.692 --> 02:03:21.694
CALIFORNIA MUSEUM THAT ALLOWS

02:03:21.761 --> 02:03:22.561
THE NATIVE.

02:03:22.628 --> 02:03:23.929
STORIES TO BE TOLD A NATIVE

02:03:23.996 --> 02:03:25.698
VOICES SO THAT'S GOING TO BE

02:03:25.765 --> 02:03:26.799
ABSOLUTELY KEY.

02:03:26.866 --> 02:03:28.768
I AM GLAD THAT YOU BROUGHT UP

02:03:28.834 --> 02:03:30.503
THE NOTION OF TECHNOLOGY THE WAY

02:03:30.569 --> 02:03:31.837
PEOPLE AND VISITORS WANT TO

INTERACT AND MUSEUMS. ON TODAY

02:03:35.007 --> 02:03:36.776
IS VASTLY DIFFERENT THAN KIND OF

02:03:36.842 --> 02:03:38.277
THE STATIC EXPERIENCES THAT WE

02:03:38.344 --> 02:03:40.513
GREW UP WITH AS KIDS SO OUR

02:03:40.579 --> 02:03:41.947
INTENT WITH THIS PROJECT IS THAT

02:03:42.014 --> 02:03:44.383
YOU WILL SEE MORE OF AN INFUSION.

02:03:44.450 --> 02:03:46.185
OF TECHNOLOGY WE WILL BE LOOKING

02:03:46.252 --> 02:03:48.521
VERY CLOSELY AND HAVE BEEN AT

02:03:48.587 --> 02:03:50.422
THE SMITHSONIAN.

02:03:50.489 --> 02:03:52.091
MUSEUM AT NATIVE AMERICAN

02:03:52.158 --> 02:03:54.493
HISTORY WE WILL ALSO BE LOOKING

02:03:54.560 --> 02:03:55.427

OTHER MUSEUMS OF THAT STATURE

02:03:57.863 --> 02:03:59.198
AND GETTING A SENSE AND LEARNING

02:03:59.265 --> 02:04:00.933
ABOUT WITH LEARNING FROM THEM

02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:02.668
ABOUT WHAT'S WHAT'S WORKED AND.

02:04:02.735 --> 02:04:04.503
AND WHAT HASN'T WORKED AS WE

02:04:04.570 --> 02:04:06.939
WORK WITH THE TRIBAL COMMUNITY.

02:04:07.006 --> 02:04:08.574
WHEN QUICKLY FOUGHT THE DEFENSE

02:04:08.641 --> 02:04:09.375
DO IT DID I UNDERSTAND THAT IS

02:04:09.441 --> 02:04:11.010
GOING TO BE ON A RIPPED THE

02:04:11.076 --> 02:04:13.445
RIVER FRONTAGE WILL IT BE A OF

02:04:13.512 --> 02:04:14.513
RIVER FRONTAGE.

02:04:14.580 --> 02:04:15.748
I'LL AT THE CONFLUENCE OF THE

02:04:15.815 --> 02:04:17.817
AMERICAN IN THE SACK CRACKED.

02:04:17.883 --> 02:04:20.753

02:04:20.820 --> 02:04:21.487
THANK YOU AND DOES NOT BEEN

02:04:21.554 --> 02:04:23.122
BACKED UP FOR A QUICK SECOND ON

02:04:23.189 --> 02:04:24.924
THE MUSEUM OF TOLERANCE A

02:04:24.990 --> 02:04:26.091
PROPOSAL.

02:04:26.525 --> 02:04:28.661
I I I I KNOW THE FOLKS THERE

02:04:28.727 --> 02:04:30.362
WITH MUSEUM IS IN MY DISTRICT I

VISITED IT MANY TIMES.

02:04:31.797 --> 02:04:33.599
AND I KNOW THE INTENTION THERE

02:04:33.666 --> 02:04:35.968
IS TO INCORPORATE INTO A TOP

02:04:36.035 --> 02:04:37.436
RATE TECHNOLOGY ALSO.

02:04:37.503 --> 02:04:39.171
SO THAT THE MISSION OF THAT

02:04:39.238 --> 02:04:41.574
FACILITY CAN BE ACHIEVED AT ITS

02:04:41.640 --> 02:04:42.241
HIGHEST LEVEL.

02:04:42.308 --> 02:04:44.543

ROSS STATE HISTORIC PARK IT'S

02:04:53.252 --> 02:04:54.820
VERY CLEAR THAT INTERPRETS.

02:04:54.887 --> 02:04:57.022
A TWENTY YEAR PERIOD IN WHICH.

02:04:57.089 --> 02:04:58.591
THAT THE RUSSIAN MERCANTILE

02:04:58.657 --> 02:05:00.359
PERIOD WHERE THERE IS A

02:05:00.426 --> 02:05:01.994
PARTNERSHIP WITH I'M VARIOUS

02:05:02.061 --> 02:05:03.529
NATIVE PEOPLES ALONG WITH THE

02:05:03.596 --> 02:05:05.097
RUSSIANS THAT RESIDED THERE FOR

02:05:05.164 --> 02:05:07.099
TWENTY YEARS. WHAT YOU DON'T SEE

02:05:07.166 --> 02:05:08.000
AS ANY FOR?

CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE NATIVE

02:05:14.139 --> 02:05:17.042
PEOPLES ON DURING THAT TIME AND

THE ARRIVAL OF THOSE GROUPS AND

02:05:21.046 --> 02:05:22.514
SO WHAT THIS WOULD DO WOULD

02:05:22.581 --> 02:05:24.316
ESTABLISH A CULTURAL TRAIL IT'S

02:05:24.383 --> 02:05:26.452
ROUGHLY THREE MILES LONG IT ALSO

02:05:26.518 --> 02:05:28.520
WOULD COMPLETE A SEGMENT OF

02:05:28.587 --> 02:05:30.256
CALIFORNIA'S COASTAL TRAIL.

02:05:30.322 --> 02:05:32.458
IT WILL BE DONE THROUGH

02:05:32.524 --> 02:05:33.792
PARTNERSHIPS WITH THE TRIBAL

02:05:33.859 --> 02:05:34.960
COMMUNITY.

02:05:35.027 --> 02:05:37.363
IN THAT AREA PRIMARILY THE TEST

02:05:37.429 --> 02:05:38.831
SCIENTISTS WHO HAVE ALREADY

02:05:38.898 --> 02:05:40.799

IN THAT PARTICULAR PARK.

02:05:59.351 --> 02:06:01.253
SPEAKING OF TECHNOLOGY THE

02:06:01.320 --> 02:06:02.655
INTENT IS THAT THIS WOULD NOT

02:06:02.721 --> 02:06:05.424
JUST BE A TRAIL TO WALK BUT THAT

02:06:05.491 --> 02:06:06.625

OUR.

02:21:46.064 --> 02:21:48.733
A RECYCLING IS A SIGNIFICANTLY

02:21:48.800 --> 02:21:49.033
DIMINISHED.

02:21:49.100 --> 02:21:50.068
.

02:21:50.134 --> 02:21:52.103
MY UNDERSTANDING IS.

02:21:52.170 --> 02:21:54.172
OUR RATES ARE DOWN AT SEVENTY

02:21:54.239 --> 02:21:56.541
FIVE PERCENT THE GOAL IS EIGHTY

02:21:56.608 --> 02:21:58.743
PERCENT I THINK IT'S BEEN A FIVE

02:21:58.810 --> 02:22:00.712
PERCENT REDUCTION OVER THE. A

02:22:00.778 --> 02:22:03.081
PAST COUPLE OF YEARS AND IT TO A.

02:22:03.147 --> 02:22:05.416
AT IT.

02:22:05.483 --> 02:22:06.985
IN ADDITION TO.

02:22:07.085 --> 02:22:07.518
THE.

A SITUATION WITH CHINA.

02:22:11.256 --> 02:22:13.424
A MAJOR CAUSE OF THAT THE

02:22:13.491 --> 02:22:14.859
REDUCTIONS THE CLOSURE OF EIGHT

02:22:14.926 --> 02:22:16.928
HUNDRED. RECYCLING LOCATIONS

02:22:16.995 --> 02:22:20.164
THROUGHOUT THE STATE.

02:22:20.231 --> 02:22:22.033
GIVEN THE A. S. SIGNIFICANCE OF

02:22:22.100 --> 02:22:23.735
THE LOSS OF RECYCLING

02:22:23.801 --> 02:22:26.104
I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT I

02:22:26.170 --> 02:22:26.537
APPRECIATE THAT THE

02:22:26.604 --> 02:22:27.805
ADMINISTRATION IS PUTTING

02:22:27.872 --> 02:22:29.440
FORWARD SOMETHING IN AN ATTEMPT

02:22:29.507 --> 02:22:30.942
TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM AND.

02:22:31.009 --> 02:22:32.043
AT AT AS YOU KNOW THE

02:22:32.110 --> 02:22:33.411
ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL TO

02:22:33.478 --> 02:22:35.013
REINSTATE THE PLASTIC MARKET

02:22:35.079 --> 02:22:36.648
DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM IS SOMETHING

02:22:36.714 --> 02:22:38.716
THAT THIS SUBCOMMITTEE INCLUDED

02:22:38.783 --> 02:22:40.685
IN OUR BUDGET RECOMMENDATIONS.

02:22:40.752 --> 02:22:41.986
FOR THE PAST TWO YEARS SO

02:22:42.053 --> 02:22:43.421
GRATIFIED THAT IT'S FINALLY

02:22:43.488 --> 02:22:45.189
GETTING IN BUT THAT THAT SAID TO

02:22:45.256 --> 02:22:46.858
A DOES THE ADMINISTRATION HAVE A.

02:22:46.925 --> 02:22:48.393
POSITION ON THE OTHER ELEMENTS

02:22:48.459 --> 02:22:50.361
OF THE BOTTLE BILL FIX THAT WERE

02:22:50.428 --> 02:22:51.229
PART OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE'S

02:22:51.296 --> 02:22:53.298
RECOMMENDATIONS LAST YEAR AND.

02:22:53.364 --> 02:22:54.933
HAVE BEEN INCORPORATED INTO

02:22:54.999 --> 02:22:56.634
SENATOR GLAZERS SP FOUR TWENTY

02:22:56.701 --> 02:22:58.870
FIVE.

02:22:58.937 --> 02:23:00.738
MOBILE WE I DON'T HAVE.

02:23:00.805 --> 02:23:02.273
I'M NOT PREPARED JUST WE'RE NOT

02:23:02.340 --> 02:23:04.375
PICTURED OPINION ON ON ANY PIECE

02:23:04.442 --> 02:23:05.910
OF LEGISLATION AS WE SPEAK BUT

02:23:05.977 --> 02:23:07.245
WE CERTAINLY.

02:23:07.312 --> 02:23:08.880
CONTINUE TO.

02:23:08.947 --> 02:23:10.949
MONITOR THE OTHER ITEMS THAT

02:23:11.015 --> 02:23:12.984
YOU REYES PARTICULARLY THAT LOSS

02:23:13.051 --> 02:23:13.484
OF.

02:23:13.551 --> 02:23:15.887
RECYCLING CENTERS IS OF

02:23:15.954 --> 02:23:17.689
IMPORTANCE TO US ONE OF THE.

02:23:17.755 --> 02:23:19.324
ISSUES THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING

02:23:19.390 --> 02:23:20.858
ON IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO

02:23:20.925 --> 02:23:23.461
ANALYZE A IS WHAT EXACTLY IS THE

02:23:23.528 --> 02:23:24.262
CAUSE OF THE REDUCTION AND

02:23:24.329 --> 02:23:25.930
RECYCLING. THERE ARE MANY

02:23:25.997 --> 02:23:26.931
FACTORS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THAT

02:23:26.998 --> 02:23:29.033
THAT ARE REDUCED RATE THAT

02:23:29.100 --> 02:23:30.868
REDEMPTION RATE. ON ONE OF THEM

02:23:30.935 --> 02:23:31.936
IS.

02:23:32.003 --> 02:23:33.004
SIMPLY THE AMOUNT OF BEVERAGE

02:23:33.071 --> 02:23:34.138
CONTAINER SALES.

02:23:34.205 --> 02:23:35.506
AS THAT IS A RATE OF REDEMPTION

02:23:35.573 --> 02:23:37.175
OVER SALES AND WE'VE SEEN A

02:23:37.241 --> 02:23:38.276
SIGNIFICANT INCREASE BEVERAGE

02:23:38.343 --> 02:23:40.144
CONTAINER SALES AND SO THAT IF

02:23:40.211 --> 02:23:41.546
WE DON'T HAVE A. CORRESPONDING

02:23:41.612 --> 02:23:42.747
INCREASE IN REDEMPTION THAT.

02:23:42.814 --> 02:23:44.649
LOWERS THE RECYCLING RATE IN

02:23:44.716 --> 02:23:44.816
THE.

02:23:44.882 --> 02:23:46.317
IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS WE'VE

02:23:46.384 --> 02:23:48.019
ALSO INCREASED ARE EFFORTS ON

02:23:48.086 --> 02:23:49.287
AND ON FRAUD ENFORCEMENT.

02:23:49.354 --> 02:23:50.588
SO TO THE EXTENT THAT WE HAVE

02:23:50.655 --> 02:23:52.156
REDUCED.

02:23:52.223 --> 02:23:53.992
THE OPPORTUNITY FOR.

02:23:54.058 --> 02:23:55.960
.

02:23:56.027 --> 02:23:56.961
ILLEGAL REDEMPTION ABOUT OF

02:23:57.028 --> 02:23:58.363
STATE BEVERAGE CANNOT CONTAINERS

02:23:58.429 --> 02:23:59.831
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT

02:23:59.897 --> 02:24:00.365
WOULD ALSO DRIVE DOWN THE

02:24:00.431 --> 02:24:01.566
REDEMPTION RATE BUT THERE'S NO

02:24:01.632 --> 02:24:02.900
QUESTION WE ALSO HAVE A CONCERN

02:24:02.967 --> 02:24:04.335
ABOUT FINDING THAT PROPER LEVEL

02:24:04.402 --> 02:24:05.436
OF CONVENIENCE.

02:24:05.503 --> 02:24:07.205
RIGHT NOW WE'RE VERY FOCUSED ON

02:24:07.271 --> 02:24:07.772
IMPLEMENTING AS BEFORE FIFTY

02:24:07.839 --> 02:24:08.773
EIGHT.

02:24:08.840 --> 02:24:10.174
AND AND MAKING SURE THAT.

02:24:10.241 --> 02:24:11.609
TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN

02:24:11.676 --> 02:24:13.344
DEVELOP ALTERNATIVE MEANS OF

02:24:13.411 --> 02:24:13.778
PROVIDING REDEMPTION

02:24:13.845 --> 02:24:15.046
OPPORTUNITIES.

02:24:15.113 --> 02:24:16.881
FOR CONSUMERS IN THE STATE THAT

02:24:16.948 --> 02:24:18.116
WE THAT WE IMPLEMENT THAT

02:24:18.182 --> 02:24:18.449
PROPERLY WELL.

02:24:18.516 --> 02:24:20.118
.

02:24:20.184 --> 02:24:20.518
THANK YOU FOR.

02:24:20.618 --> 02:24:23.621
.

02:24:23.688 --> 02:24:24.956
REALLY ACT A IN A VERY CONCISE

02:24:25.023 --> 02:24:26.557
WAY.

02:24:26.624 --> 02:24:28.026
TALKING ABOUT THE.

02:24:28.092 --> 02:24:30.628
I VARIOUS COMPLEXITIES OF THIS

02:24:30.695 --> 02:24:32.030
ISSUE IT'S NOT SIMPLE I

02:24:32.096 --> 02:24:32.797
UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE

02:24:32.864 --> 02:24:34.899
MULTIPLE CAUSES IN MULTIPLE

02:24:34.966 --> 02:24:36.534
FACTORS THAT INVOLVED IN THE.

02:24:36.601 --> 02:24:38.736
DROP IN OUR RECYCLING RATES BUT

02:24:38.803 --> 02:24:39.704
IT'S AN IMPORTANT ISSUE FOR US

02:24:39.771 --> 02:24:41.039
TO.

02:24:41.139 --> 02:24:42.373
TACKLE.

02:24:42.440 --> 02:24:44.275
AND I AND WE REALLY HAVE NOT

02:24:44.342 --> 02:24:45.643
BEEN ABLE DO SO OVER THE LAST

02:24:45.710 --> 02:24:47.278
SEVERAL YEARS IT'S TIME THAT WE

02:24:47.345 --> 02:24:50.048
HAVE. A MAKE THAT HAPPEN.

02:24:50.114 --> 02:24:50.581
SO.

02:24:50.648 --> 02:24:52.183
APPRECIATE YOUR EFFORTS AND

02:24:52.250 --> 02:24:53.751
WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH YOU

02:24:53.818 --> 02:24:54.986
TOWARDS THAT. THAT AND IS THERE

02:24:55.053 --> 02:24:57.622
ANY PUBLIC COMMENT ON.

02:24:58.056 --> 02:25:00.591
A COVER CYCLE SO THREE ITEMS

02:25:00.658 --> 02:25:03.728
THIRTEEN FOURTEEN AFFECTING.

02:25:03.795 --> 02:25:04.862
MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MARK

02:25:04.929 --> 02:25:05.897
MURRAY WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL

02:25:05.963 --> 02:25:07.231
GROUP CALIFORNIA'S GETS WASTE.

02:25:07.298 --> 02:25:08.966
ITEMS I SPEAKING I THINK TO

02:25:09.033 --> 02:25:10.501
ISSUE FOURTEEN.

02:25:10.568 --> 02:25:12.670
AND THAT THE CHAIRMAN HAS

02:25:12.737 --> 02:25:14.405
ARTICULATED THE PROBLEM THAT WE

02:25:14.472 --> 02:25:17.375
CONTINUE TO HAVE WITH REGARD TO.

02:25:17.442 --> 02:25:19.677
THE CLOSURE OF RECYCLING CENTERS

02:25:19.744 --> 02:25:21.779
THE DROP IN RECYCLING RATES.

02:25:21.846 --> 02:25:22.780
THERE MAY BE MANY FACTORS BUT I

02:25:22.847 --> 02:25:24.315
THINK IT'S

02:25:24.382 --> 02:25:25.683
IT'S FAIRLY TRANSPARENTLY

02:25:25.750 --> 02:25:27.418
OBVIOUS WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHEN

02:25:27.485 --> 02:25:29.387
THE CLOSURES OCCURRED. AND WHEN

02:25:29.454 --> 02:25:30.922
THE DROP IN RECYCLING RATE

02:25:30.988 --> 02:25:33.324
OCCURRED IT CORRESPONDS WITH A

02:25:33.391 --> 02:25:35.793
TWENTY PERCENT REDUCTION IN THE

02:25:35.860 --> 02:25:38.396
THE PAYMENTS THE GO TO RECYCLERS.

02:25:38.463 --> 02:25:40.431
AND I THINK THERE IS.

02:25:40.498 --> 02:25:42.600
GENERAL RECOGNITION THAT THE

02:25:42.667 --> 02:25:44.535
FORMULA FOR CALCULATING

02:25:44.602 --> 02:25:46.237
RECYCLING COSTS THE SURVEY

02:25:46.304 --> 02:25:47.238
METHODOLOGY.

02:25:47.305 --> 02:25:49.407
IS IS BASICALLY A SURVEY OF

02:25:49.474 --> 02:25:50.975
EXPENDITURES AND WHEN THE WORLD

02:25:51.042 --> 02:25:53.344
OF RECYCLING IS IN A BAD PLACE

02:25:53.411 --> 02:25:54.879
RECYCLERS DON'T SPEND AS MUCH

02:25:54.946 --> 02:25:56.214
MONEY. AND THAT IS THEN

02:25:56.280 --> 02:25:58.783
REFLECTED IN A LOWER SURVEYED

02:25:58.850 --> 02:26:00.518
COSTA RECYCLING LOWER PAYMENTS

02:26:00.585 --> 02:26:02.553
PER CYCLE RECYCLERS WEEKS KIND

02:26:02.620 --> 02:26:04.455
OF SEEN THIS DEATH SPIRAL OCCUR

02:26:04.522 --> 02:26:05.790
OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS AND

02:26:05.857 --> 02:26:07.859
AND IN TOTAL. THAT DEATH SPIRAL

02:26:07.925 --> 02:26:09.327
HAS COST THE RECYCLING

02:26:09.393 --> 02:26:11.562
INFRASTRUCTURE IN CALIFORNIA

02:26:11.629 --> 02:26:12.196
MORE THAN THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS

02:26:12.263 --> 02:26:12.997
A YEAR.

02:26:13.064 --> 02:26:14.499
AND YOU KNOW I I UNDERSTAND THAT

02:26:14.565 --> 02:26:16.701
BUT THIS MAY BE COMPLICATED BUT

02:26:16.767 --> 02:26:17.869
WHAT WE'RE UP WERE SEEN THE

02:26:17.935 --> 02:26:18.936
EXACT SAME THING HAPPENED THIS

02:26:19.003 --> 02:26:20.438
YEAR.

02:26:20.505 --> 02:26:22.306
WE'VE SEEN THE COSTA. FOR PT

02:26:22.373 --> 02:26:23.708
BOTTLES

02:26:23.774 --> 02:26:25.710
STILL REMAINS TWENTY PERCENT

02:26:25.776 --> 02:26:28.212
BELOW THE THE COST BASIS THAT

02:26:28.279 --> 02:26:30.081
WAS IN PLACE IN TWENTY FIFTEEN

02:26:30.148 --> 02:26:32.316
BEFORE ALL THIS DROPPED OCCURRED.

02:26:32.383 --> 02:26:33.551
THE PROCESSING PAYMENT IS THE

02:26:33.618 --> 02:26:34.685
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE COST

SEVENTY MILLION AND ONE TIME

02:41:44.294 --> 02:41:46.196

TO USE THAT TO TO LEVERAGE AND

02:42:13.023 --> 02:42:14.257
CREATE INCENTIVES FOR LOCAL

02:42:14.324 --> 02:42:15.592
MAINTAINING AGENCIES ON THAT

02:42:15.659 --> 02:42:16.893

02:45:58.048 --> 02:45:59.649
TO THE METRO CENTER THE

02:45:59.716 --> 02:46:01.484
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE WOULD THEN

02:46:01.551 --> 02:46:03.720
EXPAND. ITS FOOTPRINT DIRECTLY

02:46:03.787 --> 02:46:06.589
INTO BC DC'S CURRENT SPACE AND

02:46:06.656 --> 02:46:07.791
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IS IN

02:46:07.857 --> 02:46:09.526
TERRIBLE NEED OF X. OF EXTRA

02:46:09.592 --> 02:46:11.428
SPACE IN SAN FRANCISCO SO THAT

02:46:11.494 --> 02:46:13.396
WORKS OUT VERY WELL.

02:46:13.463 --> 02:46:14.698
FOR THE SECOND BASIC REASONS

02:46:14.764 --> 02:46:16.499
BASIC ECONOMICS.

02:46:16.566 --> 02:46:18.034
OAKLAND AND SAN FRANCISCO IN THE

02:46:18.101 --> 02:46:19.536
REST OF THE BAY AREA A COUPLE

02:46:19.602 --> 02:46:21.271
YEARS AGO BECAME THE MOST

02:46:21.338 --> 02:46:23.673
EXPENSIVE PLACE NOT ONLY TO LIVE

02:46:23.740 --> 02:46:24.908
IN THE UNITED STATES BUT ALSO TO

02:46:24.974 --> 02:46:26.643
WORK.

02:46:26.710 --> 02:46:28.044
TRYING TO FIND SPACE AND IT WAS

02:46:28.111 --> 02:46:31.147
A.

02:46:31.214 --> 02:46:32.515
FOR WHICH WERE VERY APPRECIATIVE

02:46:32.582 --> 02:46:32.816
BY THE WAY.

02:46:32.882 --> 02:46:34.250
.

02:46:34.317 --> 02:46:35.118
BUT ALSO IT'S ALSO CERTAINLY TO

02:46:35.185 --> 02:46:36.453
WORK.

02:46:36.519 --> 02:46:38.688
COMMERCIAL SPACE IS NOT ONLY AT

02:46:38.755 --> 02:46:39.622
A PREMIUM BUT YOU CAN IMAGINE

02:46:39.689 --> 02:46:41.257
THE COST

02:46:41.324 --> 02:46:43.526
B. CDC WILL RECEIVE BELOW MARKET

02:46:43.593 --> 02:46:45.895
RATE AT. OF THE NEW HEADQUARTERS

02:46:45.962 --> 02:46:48.098
AND IT'LL LABELS DOJ NOT TO HAVE

02:46:48.164 --> 02:46:49.933
TO GO OUT AND TRY TO FIND SPACE

02:46:49.999 --> 02:46:52.035
FOR ITS STAFF AT WHAT WOULD BE

02:46:52.102 --> 02:46:53.970
NO DOUBT VERY VERY EXPENSIVE PER

02:46:54.037 --> 02:46:57.273
SQUARE FOOT RATES.

02:46:57.340 --> 02:46:59.609
THANK YOU ALEJO. YES SO WHILE

02:46:59.676 --> 02:47:01.077
THE PROGRAMMATIC BENEFITS FOR BE

02:47:01.144 --> 02:47:02.712
CDC TO BE CO LOCATED WITH THEIR

02:47:02.779 --> 02:47:04.180
PARTNERS ARE VALUABLE WE DIDN'T

02:47:04.247 --> 02:47:05.749
THINK THAT WAS ENOUGH TO JUSTIFY

02:47:05.815 --> 02:47:07.384
THIS EXPENDITURE ON ITS OWN SO

02:47:07.450 --> 02:47:09.085
WE LOOKED INTO A QUITE CAREFULLY.

02:47:09.152 --> 02:47:11.621
AND LOOKED INTO DOJ'S OFFICE

02:47:11.688 --> 02:47:13.223
NEEDS AND ASSOCIATED COSTS AND

02:47:13.289 --> 02:47:14.958
DID FIND THAT OVERALL THIS

02:47:15.024 --> 02:47:16.993
APPROACH IS THE LEAST COSTLY.

02:47:17.060 --> 02:47:18.695
ALTERNATIVE FOR THE STATE WHEN

02:47:18.762 --> 02:47:20.663
YOU ENCOMPASS THE NEEDS OF BOTH

02:47:20.730 --> 02:47:23.299
AGENCIES BE CDC AND HAD DOJ SO

02:47:23.366 --> 02:47:24.434
WE DO FEEL THAT THIS PROPOSAL

02:47:24.501 --> 02:47:26.202
BEFORE HE WAS JUST FINE.

02:47:26.269 --> 02:47:27.937
THANK YOU I I THINK I THINK IT'S

A REALLY GOOD THAT WE'RE LOOKING

02:47:29.539 --> 02:47:31.007
AT THIS HOLISTICALLY AND NOT

02:47:31.074 --> 02:47:32.842
JUST TO A IN THE AREA KIND OF A

02:47:32.909 --> 02:47:35.078
SILENT APPROACH.

02:47:35.145 --> 02:47:36.713
YOU CAN LET BERMAN FINANCE CHAIR

02:47:36.780 --> 02:47:37.313

AND ALSO BE CITIES IN THE OJ

02:47:47.190 --> 02:47:50.260
BASIS MAKES THE MOST SENSE OF.

02:47:50.326 --> 02:47:51.728
WITH IT WE HAD TO A MEETING OR

02:47:51.795 --> 02:47:54.197

02:47:56.466 --> 02:47:56.766
SUGGESTED THAT.

02:47:56.833 --> 02:47:59.035
THEY MIGHT.

02:47:59.102 --> 02:47:59.936
DO BETTER.

02:48:00.036 --> 02:48:01.604
IF THEY WEREN'T IN SAN

AVAILABLE REALLY TO.

02:48:13.049 --> 02:48:15.752
IN THE SAME WAY TO BE CDC WHICH

02:48:15.819 --> 02:48:16.419
THAT IS CORRECT BECAUSE NEEDS TO

03:05:24.880 --> 03:05:26.148
THE STAKEHOLDER PROCESS.

03:05:26.215 --> 03:05:28.450
WE'LL START.

03:05:28.517 --> 03:05:30.419
BASICALLY NOW ESPECIALLY WITH

03:05:30.486 --> 03:05:32.454
ENACTMENT OF THE B. BILL W.

03:05:32.521 --> 03:05:33.288
STAKEHOLDER PROCESS FOR ITS

03:05:33.355 --> 03:05:36.325
IMPLEMENTATION.

03:05:36.391 --> 03:05:38.494
COOL WELL.

03:05:38.560 --> 03:05:39.127
OKAY.

03:05:39.194 --> 03:05:41.163
BUT WITH THE STRUCTURE ALREADY

03:05:41.230 --> 03:05:42.264
SET IN PLACE.

03:05:42.664 --> 03:05:44.666
BY THE BUDGETARY ACTIONS THAT

03:05:44.733 --> 03:05:46.802
TO. HAVE THAT THAT THAT WE TAKE

03:05:46.869 --> 03:05:49.738
SO THAT WOULD LIMIT THE ABILITY

03:05:49.805 --> 03:05:51.507
OF STAKEHOLDERS TO ACTUALLY HAVE

03:05:51.573 --> 03:05:52.741
AN IMPACT ON.

03:05:52.808 --> 03:05:54.910
OF HOW THIS ALL COMES TOGETHER

03:05:54.977 --> 03:05:57.546
WITH THE LEGISLATURE DECIDES IN

03:05:57.613 --> 03:05:58.881
OUR FEE SYSTEM LEGISLATURE

03:05:58.947 --> 03:06:01.049
DECIDES HOW MUCH OF THE PROGRAM

03:06:01.116 --> 03:06:02.885
BEFRIENDED BY FEES.

03:06:02.951 --> 03:06:04.386
AND HOW MUCH THE PROGRAM WILL BE

03:06:04.453 --> 03:06:06.355
PAID FOR BY THE GENERAL FUND.

03:06:06.421 --> 03:06:07.389
AND THEN THE STATE TAKES THAT

03:06:07.456 --> 03:06:08.790
DIRECTION

03:06:08.857 --> 03:06:10.893
TO DECIDE HOW TO SPREAD THE THE

03:06:10.959 --> 03:06:12.027
FEES BUT YOU'RE RIGHT THE

03:06:12.094 --> 03:06:14.129
LEGISLATURE DECIDES.

03:06:14.196 --> 03:06:16.298

HOW MUCH OF THIS PROGRAM WILL BE

03:06:17.699 --> 03:06:20.802
COVERED BY FEES?

03:06:20.869 --> 03:06:22.237
OKAY UM WE HAVE OTHER QUESTIONS

03:06:22.304 --> 03:06:23.438
THAT I I DON'T WANT TO BELABOR

03:06:23.505 --> 03:06:24.506
THE POINT TOO MUCH.

03:06:24.573 --> 03:06:27.276
HERE TODAY BECAUSE OF THIS I AM

03:06:27.342 --> 03:06:29.111

ONE ECHO OF THE CHAIRMAN'S

03:06:40.589 --> 03:06:41.356
CONCERNS.

03:06:41.423 --> 03:06:43.125
SO MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT.

03:06:43.191 --> 03:06:45.327
WELL THE STAKEHOLDERS WERE NOT

03:06:45.394 --> 03:06:47.262
INVOLVED IN THIS BUDGET TRAILER

03:06:47.329 --> 03:06:49.731
THAT. THIS BUDGET TRAILER BILL

03:06:49.798 --> 03:06:50.933
LANGUAGE WOULD ESTABLISH

03:06:50.999 --> 03:06:52.601
SOMETHING AND AND.

03:06:52.668 --> 03:06:54.770
THE FEES WOULD THEN BE THAT

03:06:54.836 --> 03:06:56.305
WOULD THAT THE FEES THAT WOULD

03:06:56.371 --> 03:06:58.407
ENGAGE THE STAKEHOLDERS.

03:06:58.473 --> 03:06:59.441
IT WOULD THAT BE THE CART BEFORE

03:06:59.508 --> 03:07:01.009
THE HORSE WHEN YOU THAT WHAT THE

03:07:01.076 --> 03:07:02.044
SINGLE INVOLVE NATIONAL.

03:07:02.110 --> 03:07:03.779
STRUCTURE OF THE PROGRAM BEFORE

WE ACTUALLY ENGAGE IN A FEW

03:07:05.213 --> 03:07:08.050
DISCUSSION I AGAIN I THINK IT'S.

03:07:08.116 --> 03:07:09.284
I THINK IT'S GOOD MOVE

03:07:09.351 --> 03:07:10.752
LEGISLATURE'S PREROGATIVE TO

03:07:10.819 --> 03:07:13.555

03:07:13.622 --> 03:07:15.057
HOW MUCH TO FUND THE PROGRAM?

03:07:15.123 --> 03:07:17.125
HOW MUCH OF THAT SHOULD BE

03:07:17.192 --> 03:07:18.760
GENERAL FUND HOW MUCH THAT

03:07:18.827 --> 03:07:20.896

03:07:20.963 --> 03:07:22.864
WE TAKE THAT DIRECTION AND WORK

03:07:22.931 --> 03:07:25.367
WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS TO DECIDE

03:07:25.434 --> 03:07:27.035
HOW TO ALLOCATE THE FEES.

03:07:27.102 --> 03:07:29.404
BUT IT'S NOT WITHIN OUR PURVIEW

03:07:29.471 --> 03:07:30.372
TO OVERRULE THE LEGISLATIVE

03:07:30.439 --> 03:07:31.740
DIRECTION LEGISLATURE'S

03:07:31.807 --> 03:07:33.542

WE DO PROVIDE AYE TO ENSURE THAT

03:20:00.188 --> 03:20:02.190
THE CUTS THAT WE MAKE. A WILL

03:20:02.256 --> 03:20:04.926
HAVE THE LEAST NEGATIVE IMPACT

03:20:04.992 --> 03:20:06.828
ON OUR ABILITY TO PROTECT

03:20:06.894 --> 03:20:08.896

BUT I AGREE WITH THAT. AND AND

03:20:29.717 --> 03:20:31.119
THINK THAT WE NEED MORE FUNDING.

03:21:36.250 --> 03:21:38.152
CONSIDERABLE EFFORT INTO

03:21:54.368 --> 03:21:55.570
ISSUES FIRST OF ALL I DO AGREE

03:21:55.636 --> 03:21:56.904
THAT THAT.

03:21:56.971 --> 03:21:59.574
THERE'S CONCERN ABOUT.

03:21:59.640 --> 03:22:01.008
USING THE FUNDS IN THE WAY THAT

03:22:01.075 --> 03:22:01.476
I THINK ARE THE CHAIR

ARTICULATED.

03:22:02.577 --> 03:22:04.445
HOWEVER EVEN BESIDES BEYOND

03:22:04.512 --> 03:22:07.882
THAT I DO THINK THAT THERE. IS A

03:22:07.949 --> 03:22:09.917
UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY RIGHT NOW.

03:22:09.984 --> 03:22:13.354
A TO. TARGET FUNDS AND INCREASE

03:22:13.421 --> 03:22:14.722
FUNDS IN THE WAY THAT WE HAVEN'T

03:22:14.789 --> 03:22:18.693
DONE IN RECENT YEARS. THAT.

03:22:18.759 --> 03:22:21.329
WELL WE CAN CERTAINLY IDENTIFY A

03:22:21.395 --> 03:22:23.698
VERY CLEARLY THE NEED OF A AND

03:22:23.764 --> 03:22:26.067
THE BENEFIT. OF OF ENSURING THAT

03:22:26.133 --> 03:22:27.001
THOSE FUNDS OF THEIRS ON IN

03:22:27.068 --> 03:22:28.736
TERMS OF SOME OF THE INSPECTIONS

03:22:28.803 --> 03:22:30.605
AND WHAT WE CAN DO MORE AND I

03:22:30.671 --> 03:22:31.739
THINK WE CAN DO THAT WAY THAT'S

03:22:31.806 --> 03:22:34.008
FISCALLY PRUDENT. AND EFFICIENT.

03:22:34.075 --> 03:22:36.377
BUT I DON'T THINK I AM IT'S

03:22:36.444 --> 03:22:38.446
ACCEPTABLE FOR US TO.

03:22:38.513 --> 03:22:40.915
URBAN TO OCCUR EXCEPT GOING INTO

03:22:40.982 --> 03:22:42.216
THE NEXT TWO OR THREE YEARS AGO

03:22:42.283 --> 03:22:44.418
BUDGET SHORTFALLS IN AND.

03:22:44.485 --> 03:22:45.720
DEPARTMENT THAT'S CRITICALLY

03:22:45.786 --> 03:22:47.188
IMPORTANT I THINK FOR THE HEALTH

03:22:47.255 --> 03:22:49.323
AND SAFETY OF ALL CALIFORNIANS I

03:22:49.390 --> 03:22:50.892
THINK YOU'D AGREE. WITH THAT.

03:22:50.958 --> 03:22:52.260
OTHER ROOKIE DUES IMPORTANT THE

03:22:52.326 --> 03:22:53.928
WORK THAT WE SUPPORT IS

03:22:53.995 --> 03:22:54.962
IMPORTANT BUT I THINK THAT WE

03:22:55.029 --> 03:22:56.464
NEED TO DO MORE. AND I THINK

03:22:56.531 --> 03:22:58.266
THAT RECENT INCIDENTS THROUGHOUT

03:22:58.332 --> 03:22:59.700
THE STATE FRANKLY. HAVE

03:22:59.767 --> 03:23:01.669
INDICATED THAT WE'RE NOT DOING

03:23:01.736 --> 03:23:02.103
ENOUGH.

03:23:02.169 --> 03:23:04.438
BUT I AYE BUT I BELIEVE THERE'S

03:23:04.505 --> 03:23:06.073
A PATH FORWARD TO ENSURE THAT WE

03:23:06.140 --> 03:23:10.044
DON'T. I'M GET TO A DEFICIT.

03:23:10.111 --> 03:23:10.645

SENSES CONTROL ACCOUNT AS WELL

03:23:14.482 --> 03:23:15.917
AS WITH THE OPERATIONS OF THE

03:23:18.052 --> 03:23:20.421
THAT DOESN'T. REQUIRE YOU KNOW

USING AND WAYS OTHER THAN THEIR

03:23:24.225 --> 03:23:25.326
INTENDED. AND I THINK THAT'S

03:23:25.393 --> 03:23:26.527
INCOMING UPON US AS A

03:23:26.594 --> 03:23:27.361

03:23:48.282 --> 03:23:49.984
THAT FUND IS

03:23:50.051 --> 03:23:51.519
APPARENTLY AN EASY TARGET FOR

03:23:51.586 --> 03:23:52.753
DIVERSION I'M I DON'T THINK

03:23:52.820 --> 03:23:53.521

THIS ISN'T JUST SOMETHING THAT I

03:24:20.848 --> 03:24:21.949
THINK WE CAN DANCE AROUND THIS

03:24:22.016 --> 03:24:25.419

03:26:33.547 --> 03:26:35.416
COMES FROM. RECOGNIZING THAT

03:26:35.483 --> 03:26:36.217
THERE ARE DIFFICULT FISCAL

03:26:36.283 --> 03:26:37.485
POLICY.

03:26:37.551 --> 03:26:38.919
ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED

03:26:38.986 --> 03:26:39.120
WELL.

03:26:39.186 --> 03:26:42.256
.

03:26:42.323 --> 03:26:43.758
I I DON'T WANT TO GET A NEW

03:26:43.824 --> 03:26:45.526
ALONG BACK AND FORTH WITH TO.

03:26:45.593 --> 03:26:47.995
ó OVER THIS BUT I I HAVE TO

03:26:48.062 --> 03:26:48.395
SAY JUST

03:26:48.462 --> 03:26:51.899
SOME.

03:26:51.966 --> 03:26:52.666
I'M JUST GONNA HOLD OFF

03:26:52.733 --> 03:26:55.269
RESPONDING LA BECAUSE I WANTED

03:26:55.336 --> 03:26:56.337
DIVE INTO THE SLOW BUT DEEPER

03:26:56.403 --> 03:26:57.338
BUT I'LL DO THAT.

03:26:57.404 --> 03:26:58.906
OUTSIDE OF THE.

03:26:58.973 --> 03:27:00.975
OUTSIDE THE HEARING.

03:27:01.041 --> 03:27:03.244
HOWEVER.

03:27:03.310 --> 03:27:05.579
ASSEMBLY MEMBER CARILLO.

03:27:05.646 --> 03:27:08.048
WROTE A LETTER ON MAY TENTH

03:27:08.115 --> 03:27:08.682
THAT.

03:27:08.749 --> 03:27:10.851
ADDRESSES SOME OF THE.

03:27:10.918 --> 03:27:13.721
AND NEEDS APTLY EXCITED SITE

03:27:13.788 --> 03:27:15.422
WHICH IS ONE OF THE ITEMS IT'S

03:27:15.489 --> 03:27:16.791
ON OUR AGENDA.

03:27:16.857 --> 03:27:18.192
ON AND RAISES A NUMBER OF

03:27:18.259 --> 03:27:20.060
QUESTIONS ONE OF THOSE.

03:27:20.127 --> 03:27:21.128
IS.

03:27:21.195 --> 03:27:24.131
A DTS SEES DETERMINATION THAT.

03:27:24.198 --> 03:27:28.002
PARKWAYS WON'T BE REMEDIATED.

03:27:28.502 --> 03:27:31.071
AND I'M PARAPHRASING BECAUSE

03:27:31.138 --> 03:27:33.107
PARKWAY AREAS IN FRONT OF HOMES

03:27:33.174 --> 03:27:36.010
ARE LESS USED THAN OTHER AREAS

03:27:36.076 --> 03:27:40.114
ON THE PROPERTY. AND IT A I CAN.

03:27:40.181 --> 03:27:42.550
I HAVE TO ASSUME THAT THE REASON

03:27:42.616 --> 03:27:44.385
FOR THAT DETERMINATION HAS MORE

03:27:44.451 --> 03:27:45.853
TO DO WITH THE EXPENDITURE OF

03:27:45.920 --> 03:27:47.855
FUNDS THAN IT DOES WITH THE NEED

03:27:47.922 --> 03:27:49.023
TO CLEAN UP.

03:27:49.089 --> 03:27:50.724
EVEN THOUGH IT'S ALL A LOWER

03:27:50.791 --> 03:27:52.827
NEED SO IF WE'RE MAKING

03:27:52.893 --> 03:27:54.228
DECISIONS

03:27:54.295 --> 03:27:56.730
OF LIKE THAT TO NOT SPEND MONEY

03:27:56.797 --> 03:27:58.365
FROM THIS FUND.

03:27:58.432 --> 03:28:00.601
WHILE AT THE SAME TIME WERE

03:28:00.668 --> 03:28:02.036
MOVING MONEY OUT OF THE FUNDS

03:28:02.102 --> 03:28:04.638
FOR OTHER PURPOSES THERE TO ME

03:28:04.705 --> 03:28:07.007
SEEMS TO BE A A A DISCONNECT.

03:28:07.074 --> 03:28:07.975
SO.

03:28:08.042 --> 03:28:10.110
AND I REALIZE THIS LETTERS ONLY

03:28:10.177 --> 03:28:11.912
A BEEN OUT FOR A FEW DAYS I

03:28:11.979 --> 03:28:13.848
DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE PREPARED TO

03:28:13.914 --> 03:28:15.749
RESPOND TO THE ISSUES THAT. MS

03:28:15.816 --> 03:28:16.884
CARILLO RAISES IF YOU'RE NOT

03:28:16.951 --> 03:28:17.852
THAT'S

03:28:17.918 --> 03:28:18.385
PERFECTLY.

03:28:18.452 --> 03:28:21.422
UNDERSTANDABLE AT THAT AT AT

03:28:21.488 --> 03:28:23.924
THIS POINT BUT I WOULD LIKE TO.

03:28:23.991 --> 03:28:26.293
I ASK FOR A RESPONSE TO THE

03:28:26.360 --> 03:28:27.828
ISSUES THAT ARE RAISED IN THAT

03:28:27.895 --> 03:28:29.430
MAY TENTH LETTER FROM ASSEMBLY

03:28:29.496 --> 03:28:31.599
MEMBER CARILLO IF NOT TODAY THEN

03:28:31.665 --> 03:28:32.566
AND.

03:28:32.633 --> 03:28:34.702
IN SHORT ORDER.

03:28:34.768 --> 03:28:36.804
COULD YOU ADDRESS THAT.

03:28:36.871 --> 03:28:38.939
AS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER I ASKED

03:28:39.006 --> 03:28:40.941
SOME OF THE IMPORTANT QUESTIONS

03:28:41.008 --> 03:28:42.109
ABOUT OUR WORK.

03:28:42.176 --> 03:28:43.744
.

03:28:43.811 --> 03:28:46.347
A REGARDING OTHER CLEANUP IN THE

03:28:46.413 --> 03:28:49.183
COMMUNITY AROUND ON THE EXCITED.

03:28:49.250 --> 03:28:51.819
FACILITY ON THE DEPARTMENT HAS

03:28:51.886 --> 03:28:52.519
BEEN.

03:28:52.586 --> 03:28:54.588
ENGAGED IN CLEAN UP ACTIVITIES

03:28:54.655 --> 03:28:57.558
THERE UP FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS

03:28:57.625 --> 03:29:00.327
NOW. WE'VE OVERSEEN THE.

03:29:00.394 --> 03:29:03.030
TESTING OF ABOUT EIGHTY FIVE

03:29:03.097 --> 03:29:04.398
HUNDRED PROPERTIES IN THAT

03:29:04.465 --> 03:29:06.467
COMMUNITY WE HAVE CLEANED UP

03:29:06.533 --> 03:29:08.402
OVER THREE HUNDRED PROPERTIES IN

03:29:08.469 --> 03:29:09.904
THAT COMMUNITY.

03:29:09.970 --> 03:29:12.273
YOU ARE CORRECTTHAT THE

03:29:12.339 --> 03:29:14.241
DEPARTMENT IS NOT CURRENTLY

03:29:14.308 --> 03:29:16.877
INCLUDING PARKWAYS AYE IN THE

03:29:16.944 --> 03:29:19.346
CLEANUP ACTIVITIES. ON THAT ARE

03:29:19.413 --> 03:29:21.348
OF BEING OVERSEEN AND THAT ARE.

03:29:21.415 --> 03:29:23.350
SPELLED OUT IN THE CLEANUP PLAN

03:29:23.417 --> 03:29:25.219
THAT WAS A APPROVED AND

03:29:25.286 --> 03:29:27.321
CERTIFIED A WITH ENVIRONMENTAL

03:29:27.388 --> 03:29:30.791
DOCUMENTS OF LAST YEAR.

03:29:30.858 --> 03:29:33.827
WE MADE THAT DECISION BECAUSE AS

03:29:33.894 --> 03:29:35.596
YOU HAVE OBSERVED ALL THE

03:29:35.663 --> 03:29:37.164
LEGISLATURE APPROPRIATED.

03:29:37.231 --> 03:29:39.166
A FINITE AMOUNT OF RESOURCES

03:29:39.233 --> 03:29:41.135
FOR THE DEPARTMENT.

03:29:41.201 --> 03:29:43.304
CLEAN UP OF THE UP PROPERTIES

03:29:43.370 --> 03:29:45.306
WHERE THERE IS THE HIGHEST

03:29:45.372 --> 03:29:47.775
LEVELS OF LEAD AND THE GREATEST

03:29:47.841 --> 03:29:49.176
POTENTIAL EXPOSURE TO. OUR

03:29:49.243 --> 03:29:50.811
RESIDENTS

03:29:50.878 --> 03:29:53.180
ESPECIALLY VULNERABLE RESIDENTS

03:29:53.247 --> 03:29:54.815
LIVING ON THOSE PROPERTIES

03:29:54.882 --> 03:29:56.317
AND THE.

03:29:56.383 --> 03:29:58.485
THE DEPARTMENT DID AN ANALYSIS

03:29:58.552 --> 03:30:00.988
OF WHERE EXPOSURES ARE MOST

03:30:01.055 --> 03:30:02.890
LIKELY TO OCCUR. TO YOUNG

03:30:02.957 --> 03:30:04.425
CHILDREN.

03:30:04.491 --> 03:30:07.061
AND THOSE EXPOSURES ARE FAR MORE

03:30:07.127 --> 03:30:09.029
LIKELY TO OCCUR IN THE PLAY

03:30:09.096 --> 03:30:11.598
AREAS THAN THEY ARE IN THOSE UP

03:30:11.665 --> 03:30:14.568
PLANTED STRIPS ALONG ROADWAYS.

03:30:14.635 --> 03:30:17.338
AND SO WE HAVE MADE A DECISION

03:30:17.404 --> 03:30:19.006
THAT.

03:30:19.073 --> 03:30:20.774
IT IS THE BEST USE OF THE

03:30:20.841 --> 03:30:23.177
LIMITED FUNDS TO INSURE THAT WE

03:30:23.243 --> 03:30:26.280
CLEAN UP THOSE PLAY AREAS RATHER

03:30:26.347 --> 03:30:27.314
THAN. THE.

03:30:27.381 --> 03:30:29.350
PLANTED AREAS ALONG THE

03:30:29.416 --> 03:30:31.452
ROADWAYS WHERE CHILDREN YOUNG

03:30:31.518 --> 03:30:33.654
CHILDREN DON'T GENERALLY SPEND

03:30:33.721 --> 03:30:35.222
EXTENSIVE AMOUNTS OF TIME

03:30:35.289 --> 03:30:36.991
PLAYING IN THE DIRT.

03:30:37.057 --> 03:30:39.360
BOB IT WOULD COST AN

03:30:39.426 --> 03:30:41.428
APPROXIMATELY AN ADDITIONAL TEN

03:30:41.495 --> 03:30:43.163
PERCENT.

03:30:43.230 --> 03:30:44.631
ACT ACTUALLY THINK IT'S

03:30:44.698 --> 03:30:46.066
THIRTEEN PERCENT.

03:30:46.133 --> 03:30:49.203
FOR THE DEPARTMENT UNDERTAKE

03:30:49.269 --> 03:30:50.904
CLEANUP OF PARKWAYS.

03:30:50.971 --> 03:30:52.106
AND SO THAT WOULD BE A

03:30:52.172 --> 03:30:54.174
CORRESPONDING REDUCTION IN THE

03:30:54.241 --> 03:30:56.310
NUMBER OF PROPERTIES WITH PLAY

03:30:56.377 --> 03:30:58.112
AREAS THAT WOULD GET REMEDIATED

03:30:58.178 --> 03:30:59.713
WITH THESE FUNDS.

03:30:59.780 --> 03:31:01.715
IT'S A DIFFICULT CHOICE BUT OUR

03:31:01.782 --> 03:31:03.584
COMMITMENT IS ABSOLUTELY TO

03:31:03.650 --> 03:31:04.952
PROTECT THOSE VULNERABLE

03:31:05.019 --> 03:31:07.654
CHILDREN FROM THE EXPOSURE TO

03:31:07.721 --> 03:31:09.556
THE LEAD THAT WOULD HARM THEM.

03:31:09.623 --> 03:31:11.592
IS THERE A REASON WHY YOU

03:31:11.658 --> 03:31:13.260
COULDN'T ASK FOR SUPPLEMENTAL

03:31:13.327 --> 03:31:17.097
FUNDING FOR THAT PURPOSE.

03:31:17.164 --> 03:31:18.532
THE DEPARTMENT IS MINDFUL THAT

03:31:18.599 --> 03:31:20.267
WE'VE BEEN ARE AWARDED BY THE

03:31:20.334 --> 03:31:22.136
LEGISLATURE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY

03:31:22.202 --> 03:31:23.737
SIX POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS TO

03:31:23.804 --> 03:31:25.606
UNDERTAKE THIS CLEANUP.

03:31:25.672 --> 03:31:27.574
OUT WE ARE DOING THIS WHILE WE

03:31:27.641 --> 03:31:30.844
ARE A OVERSEEING THE CLOSURE AND

03:31:30.911 --> 03:31:32.613
CORRECTIVE ACTION WORK OF THE

03:31:32.679 --> 03:31:34.815
EXILED FACILITY ITSELF.

03:31:34.882 --> 03:31:37.918
EXILED REMAINS RESPONSIBLE FOR

03:31:37.985 --> 03:31:40.954
NOT ONLY CLOSING ITS FACILITY

03:31:41.021 --> 03:31:41.989
SAFELY AND CLEANING UP THE

03:31:42.056 --> 03:31:44.124
CONTAMINATION. ON THE SIDE OF

03:31:44.191 --> 03:31:45.826
THE FACILITY BUT ALSO

03:31:45.893 --> 03:31:47.728
INVESTIGATING CONTAMINATION THE

03:31:47.795 --> 03:31:49.396
FACILITY MAY HAVE CAUSED OR

03:31:49.463 --> 03:31:50.964
CONTRIBUTED TO IN THE

03:31:51.031 --> 03:31:52.232
COMMUNITIES SURROUNDING THE

03:31:52.299 --> 03:31:54.902
FACILITY. AND ENSURING THAT THAT

03:31:54.968 --> 03:31:56.103
CONTAMINATION IS ADDRESSED AS

03:31:56.170 --> 03:31:57.538
WELL.

03:31:57.604 --> 03:31:59.740
SO THE CLEAN UP THE DEPARTMENT

03:31:59.807 --> 03:32:01.708
IS UNDERTAKING RIGHT NOW IS TO

03:32:01.775 --> 03:32:03.677
ENSURE THAT THOSE PROPERTIES

03:32:03.744 --> 03:32:05.913
WITH THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF LEAD

03:32:05.979 --> 03:32:06.447
AND THE GREATEST POTENTIAL

03:32:06.513 --> 03:32:09.083
EXPOSURE. EXPOSURES TO CHIU

03:32:09.149 --> 03:32:11.385
INCENTIVE CHILDREN ARE CLEANED

03:32:11.452 --> 03:32:13.153
UP QUICKLY.

03:32:13.220 --> 03:32:15.923
WHILE WE MAKE SURE THAT EXACT

03:32:15.989 --> 03:32:17.324
CARRIES OUT THE REST OF ITS

03:32:17.391 --> 03:32:19.760
RESPONSIBILITIES SO I DO BELIEVE

03:32:19.827 --> 03:32:21.495
THAT THE PARKWAYS WILL BE FULLY

03:32:21.562 --> 03:32:22.896
ASSESSED AND ADDRESSED AS

03:32:22.963 --> 03:32:24.198
APPROPRIATE.

03:32:24.264 --> 03:32:25.566
THROUGH THE CORRECTIVE ACTION

03:32:25.632 --> 03:32:26.567
THAT EXCITE IS REQUIRED TO

03:32:26.633 --> 03:32:31.672
UNDERTAKE.

03:32:31.738 --> 03:32:33.140
THAT I'D SWIM ACT TRY UNDERSTAND

03:32:33.207 --> 03:32:34.341
SO YOU'RE YOU'RE SAYING THAT

03:32:34.408 --> 03:32:36.877
EXCITED WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR

03:32:36.944 --> 03:32:37.544
CLEANING UP THE PARKWAYS.

03:32:37.611 --> 03:32:40.714
.

03:32:40.781 --> 03:32:42.282
BUT THE STATE WON'T UNDERTAKE

03:32:42.349 --> 03:32:42.883
THAT UNDER THE.

03:32:42.950 --> 03:32:46.153
.

03:32:46.220 --> 03:32:47.454
A PROGRAM THAT TO ADD THAT YOUR

03:32:47.521 --> 03:32:49.490
DEPARTMENT IS LEADING.

03:32:49.556 --> 03:32:50.624
WELL WE HAVE CERTIFIED A CLEANUP

03:32:50.691 --> 03:32:52.292
PLAN.

03:32:52.359 --> 03:32:54.761
AND THAT CLEAN UP PLAN

03:32:54.828 --> 03:32:56.497
SPECIFICALLY LAYS OUT HOW WE

03:32:56.563 --> 03:32:58.398
PRIORITIZE TO THE PROPERTIES FOR

03:32:58.465 --> 03:33:01.135
CLEANUP. CONSISTENT WITH THE

03:33:01.201 --> 03:33:02.102
DIRECTION FROM THE GOVERNOR AND

03:33:02.169 --> 03:33:04.638
THE LEGISLATURE TO ADDRESS.

03:33:04.705 --> 03:33:06.106
THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF LEAD AND

03:33:06.173 --> 03:33:07.641
THE GREATEST POTENTIAL EXPOSURE

03:33:07.708 --> 03:33:10.377
TO SENSITIVE INDIVIDUALS. THAT'S

03:33:10.444 --> 03:33:12.045
WHAT'S IN OUR CLEANUP PLAN WE'VE

03:33:12.112 --> 03:33:13.580
LAID IT OUT IT DOESN'T INCLUDE

03:33:13.647 --> 03:33:14.948
PARKWAYS.

03:33:15.015 --> 03:33:17.151
SHOULD THE LEGISLATURE DIRECT US

03:33:17.217 --> 03:33:18.886
TO ADDRESS PARKWAYS WE WOULD

03:33:18.952 --> 03:33:20.487
COME BACK WITH A PROPOSAL TO DO

03:33:20.554 --> 03:33:22.489
THAT HOWEVER I WANT TO

03:33:22.556 --> 03:33:24.291
UNDERSCORE. THAT.

03:33:24.358 --> 03:33:26.193
THE EGGS I'D FACILITY THAT THE

03:33:26.260 --> 03:33:28.428
COMPANY IS RESPONSIBLE UNDER

03:33:28.495 --> 03:33:31.265
FEDERAL AND STATE LAW.

03:33:31.331 --> 03:33:32.766
FOR ENSURING THAT.

03:33:32.833 --> 03:33:34.334
THE FACILITY SITE IS

03:33:34.401 --> 03:33:36.570
APPROPRIATELY CLEANED UP AND

03:33:36.637 --> 03:33:38.939
IT'S CONTAMINATION. OFF SITE IS

03:33:39.006 --> 03:33:42.009
ALSO APPROPRIATELY CLEANED UP. A

03:33:42.075 --> 03:33:43.544
FIGHT AGAIN JUST FOR

03:33:43.610 --> 03:33:44.611
CLARIFICATION AND.

03:33:44.912 --> 03:33:46.813
I THINK MY UNDERSTANDING IS
