THE EARLIER PIECE OF. CAN BE

00:31:25.883 --> 00:31:28.786
REVIEW THE BETTER CAN BE

00:31:28.853 --> 00:31:34.325
CONSIDERED BY THE LAST. THANK.

GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL- A WE HAVE

00:31:52.677 --> 00:31:54.779
SOME COMMENTS ABOUT THE SOME

00:31:54.846 --> 00:31:56.214
WHAT WE VIEW AS SOME OF THE KEY

00:31:56.281 --> 00:31:57.482
CHOICES IN THE BUDGET

00:31:57.548 --> 00:31:59.117
PARTICULARLY WITH REGARD TO THE

00:31:59.183 --> 00:32:00.018
STATE'S TO ESTIMATED

00:32:00.084 --> 00:32:02.287
DISCRETIONARY RESOURCES AND

00:32:02.353 --> 00:32:04.088
THEN I WOULD. CONCLUDE WITH A

00:32:04.155 --> 00:32:06.791
COUPLE OF COMMENTS- OF OUR VIEW

00:32:06.858 --> 00:32:09.394
ON THE IMPLICATION OF THE

00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:12.463
OVERALL PACKAGE- FORWARD BEFORE

00:32:12.530 --> 00:32:14.365
YOU- ON THE STATE'S BUDGET

00:32:14.432 --> 00:32:16.067
CONDITION AND MULTI YEAR FISCAL

00:32:16.134 --> 00:32:18.469
OUTLOOK SO WITH THAT WE'LL

00:32:18.536 --> 00:32:21.139
BEGIN WITH ON PAGE ONE I HOPE I

00:32:21.205 --> 00:32:23.041
HOPE YOU ALL HAVE THIS- HAND

00:32:23.107 --> 00:32:25.576
OUT THIS IS- ANY BEGIN WITH A

00:32:25.643 --> 00:32:26.644
BRIEF DISCUSSION OF THE

00:32:26.711 --> 00:32:27.912
PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT-

00:32:27.979 --> 00:32:29.947
PROPOSAL A TALK ABOUT IT

00:32:30.014 --> 00:32:32.083
SEPARATELY BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW

00:32:32.150 --> 00:32:34.085
PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT.

00:32:34.152 --> 00:32:34.786
HUNDRED THE UNDER THE STATE

00:32:34.852 --> 00:32:36.821
CONSTITUTION PROPOSITION NINETY

00:32:36.888 --> 00:32:37.855
EIGHT ESTABLISHES THE MINIMUM

00:32:37.922 --> 00:32:39.257
FUNDING LEVEL FOR SCHOOLS AND

00:32:39.324 --> 00:32:41.259
COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND SO YOU

00:32:41.326 --> 00:32:42.493
CAN REALLY THINK OF IT AS KIND

00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:44.195
OF A SORT OF A BUDGET ¢HIN

00:32:44.262 --> 00:32:47.699
THE BUDGET AND- FOR THE COMING

00:32:47.765 --> 00:32:50.401
YEAR TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE

00:32:50.468 --> 00:32:51.469
THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL

00:32:51.536 --> 00:32:53.304
INCLUDES EIGHTY FOUR BILLION IN

00:32:53.371 --> 00:32:55.340
TOTAL PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT

00:32:55.406 --> 00:32:57.141
FUNDING THIS IS AN INCREASE OF

00:32:57.208 --> 00:32:59.410
TWO POINT FIVE BILLION FROM THE

00:32:59.477 --> 00:33:00.311
CURRENT YEAR. NOW THE GOVERNOR

00:33:00.378 --> 00:33:04.282
POSES ONE POINT HAVE THAT GO TO

00:33:04.349 --> 00:33:09.087
ONGOING PURPOSES PRIMARILY

00:33:09.153 --> 00:33:09.854
DEFINED ACOSTA LIVING

00:33:09.921 --> 00:33:10.455
ADJUSTMENT AND LOCAL CAN. FOR

00:33:10.521 --> 00:33:12.290
ME. BUT HE WAS. ONE POINT ONE

00:33:12.357 --> 00:33:13.591
BILLION FOR ONE TIME

00:33:13.658 --> 00:33:16.260
ALLOCATIONS- NOW WE THINK THIS

00:33:16.327 --> 00:33:18.796
SPLIT IS PRUDENT BECAUSE IN THE

00:33:18.863 --> 00:33:20.098
EVENT THAT THE MINIMUM

00:33:20.164 --> 00:33:22.266
GUARANTEE WERE TO DROP. IT

00:33:22.333 --> 00:33:24.602
MEANS THAT THIS THE PROPOSITION

00:33:24.669 --> 00:33:25.136
NINETY EIGHT BUDGET COULD

00:33:25.203 --> 00:33:27.839
ACCOMMODATE THE ONGOING-

00:33:27.905 --> 00:33:30.608
PROGRAMS- WITHOUT HAVING TO

00:33:30.675 --> 00:33:33.010
MAKE CUTS DESPITE THAT DESPITE

00:33:33.077 --> 00:33:36.514
THAT POTENTIAL DROP. ANOTHER

00:33:36.581 --> 00:33:37.749
COUPLE OF POINTS I WOULD MAKE

00:33:37.815 --> 00:33:39.150
ABOUT THE PROP NINETY EIGHT

00:33:39.217 --> 00:33:41.586
PROPOSAL ONE IS THAT MANY OF

00:33:41.652 --> 00:33:42.987
THE ONE TIME PROPOSALS DO

00:33:43.054 --> 00:33:44.355
APPEAR TO ALIGN WITH THE

00:33:44.422 --> 00:33:46.190
LEGISLATURE'S PREVIOUSLY

00:33:46.257 --> 00:33:48.559
INDICATED- PRIORITIES. HOWEVER

00:33:48.626 --> 00:33:50.261
MANY OF THESE ISSUES ARE LONG

00:33:50.328 --> 00:33:52.130
STANDING ONES AND SO ONE

00:33:52.196 --> 00:33:54.532
QUESTION WE HAVE IS WHETHER ONE

00:33:54.599 --> 00:33:55.800
TIME FUNDING IS REALLY THE BEST

00:33:55.867 --> 00:33:57.268
WAY TO ADDRESS THOSE OR IF

00:33:57.335 --> 00:33:58.703
ACTUALLY THEY WOULD NEED

00:33:58.770 --> 00:34:00.938
ONGOING FUNDING. TO MAKE A

00:34:01.005 --> 00:34:02.740
DIFFERENCE OVER THE LONGER

00:34:02.807 --> 00:34:06.644
TERM. THE OTHER. COMMENT THAT

00:34:06.711 --> 00:34:08.813
WE HAVE IS IN IT IN SO FAR AS

00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:10.415
THE LEGISLATURE WANTED TO HAVE

00:34:10.481 --> 00:34:12.583
THEM THE GREATEST FISCAL IMPACT

00:34:12.650 --> 00:34:14.819
FOR THE FOR THE DISTRICTS IT

00:34:14.886 --> 00:34:16.454
COULD CONSIDER REPURPOSE SEEN

00:34:16.521 --> 00:34:18.523
SOME OF THE ONE TIME

00:34:18.589 --> 00:34:21.392
ALLOCATIONS TO- HELPING THE

00:34:21.459 --> 00:34:22.627
DISTRICTS PAY DOWN THE LONG

00:34:22.693 --> 00:34:24.228
TERM LIABILITIES THAT THEY FACE

00:34:24.295 --> 00:34:27.265
WITH RETIREE BENEFITS. IT'S SO

00:34:27.331 --> 00:34:29.333
TO THE SECOND PAGE. WHERE YOU

00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:33.838
HAVE HERE IS A- IS- SLIDE AND

00:34:33.905 --> 00:34:35.006
NOW WE'RE REALLY MOVING AWAY

00:34:35.072 --> 00:34:36.574
FROM PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT

00:34:36.641 --> 00:34:37.675
SO THIS IS SORT OF EVERYTHING

00:34:37.742 --> 00:34:39.744
ELSE IN THE BUDGET APART FROM

00:34:39.811 --> 00:34:41.345
THE NINETY EIGHT PORTION.

00:34:41.412 --> 00:34:43.514
YOU'LL NOTE ON THIS SLIDE ABOVE

00:34:43.581 --> 00:34:44.682
THE PIE CHART THERE'S A

00:34:44.749 --> 00:34:46.617
REFERENCE TO A SIX BILLION

00:34:46.684 --> 00:34:49.787
DOLLAR SURPLUS THIS IS. OUR

00:34:49.854 --> 00:34:51.289
ESTIMATE OF THE SURPLUS BASED

00:34:51.355 --> 00:34:52.723
ON THE GOVERNMENT GOVERNOR'S A

00:34:52.790 --> 00:34:54.992
BUDGET DOCUMENTS. AND IT'S VERY

00:34:55.059 --> 00:34:56.527
SIMILAR TO THE SURPLUS THAT WE

00:34:56.594 --> 00:34:58.563
ESTIMATE FROM OUR OFFICE VERY

00:34:58.629 --> 00:35:00.097
SIMILAR AND THE REASON IT'S SO

00:35:00.164 --> 00:35:01.699
SIMILAR IS THAT WE HAVE VERY

00:35:01.766 --> 00:35:03.968
CLOSE REVENUE ESTIMATES FOR THE

00:35:04.035 --> 00:35:05.937
WINDOW OF YEARS TO COVER THE

00:35:06.003 --> 00:35:10.808
BUDGET YEARS SO. 271-919-2020

00:35:10.875 --> 00:35:11.709
TWENTY ONE PERFECT DEPARTMENT

00:35:11.776 --> 00:35:13.077
THE ADMINISTRATION'S OF

00:35:13.144 --> 00:35:14.645
REVENUES IN THE BIG THREE

00:35:14.712 --> 00:35:16.247
REVENUE SOURCES ARE ONLY THIRTY

00:35:16.314 --> 00:35:18.216
FOUR MILLION ABOVE OURS SO ON

00:35:18.282 --> 00:35:21.219
IT IT'S A- NOTABLY CLOSE-

00:35:21.285 --> 00:35:23.921
FIGURE. IF WE LOOK AT THE PIE

00:35:23.988 --> 00:35:26.023
CHART I CAN GIVE YOU A COUPLE

00:35:26.090 --> 00:35:26.757
OF NUMBERS THAT MIGHT BE

00:35:26.824 --> 00:35:29.327
HELPFUL- IN THE ONGOING

00:35:29.393 --> 00:35:31.429
SPENDING CATEGORY THERE'S ONE

00:35:31.496 --> 00:35:32.797
POINT FOUR BILLION. THE

00:35:32.864 --> 00:35:34.131
GOVERNOR WOULD ALLOCATE TWO

00:35:34.198 --> 00:35:35.600
POINT SEVEN BILLION TO

00:35:35.666 --> 00:35:38.002
TEMPORARY OR ONE TIME SPENDING-

00:35:38.069 --> 00:35:40.171
PROPOSALS AND THEN HE HOLDS ONE

00:35:40.238 --> 00:35:42.206
POINT SIX BILLION ASIDE. TO

00:35:42.273 --> 00:35:43.274
MAINTAIN THE STATE'S

00:35:43.341 --> 00:35:44.742
DISCRETIONARY RESERVE THE

00:35:44.809 --> 00:35:45.910
SPECIAL FUND FOR ECONOMIC

00:35:45.977 --> 00:35:48.312
UNCERTAINTIES AND THEN THERE'S

00:35:48.379 --> 00:35:48.880
THREE HUNDRED MILLION IN THE

00:35:48.946 --> 00:35:50.581
OTHER CATEGORY. ONE THING YOU

00:35:50.648 --> 00:35:51.482
MIGHT HAVE NOTICED IN THE

00:35:51.549 --> 00:35:54.118
BUDGET IS THAT THERE ARE A HIGH

00:35:54.185 --> 00:35:56.287
NUMBER OF RELATIVELY SMALLER-

00:35:56.354 --> 00:36:00.458
PROPOSALS. AND YOU KNOW IN FACT

00:36:00.525 --> 00:36:01.993
WE LOOKED AT IT AND THERE IS

00:36:02.059 --> 00:36:04.629
WEEK WE ESTIMATE THAT. 95% OF

00:36:04.695 --> 00:36:06.264
THE PROPOSALS ARE FOR A HUNDRED

00:36:06.330 --> 00:36:07.865
MILLION OR LESS WHICH IN THE

00:36:07.932 --> 00:36:09.567
CONTEXT OF THE BUDGET THEY'RE

00:36:09.634 --> 00:36:11.802
RELATIVELY SMALL. MOVING TO THE

00:36:11.869 --> 00:36:15.172
NEXT SLIDE THREE. THIS FIGURE

00:36:15.239 --> 00:36:16.507
DISPLAYS HOW THE GOVERNOR

00:36:16.574 --> 00:36:18.776
ALLOCATE FOUR POINT ONE BILLION

00:36:18.843 --> 00:36:20.244
IN DISCRETIONARY RESOURCES

00:36:20.311 --> 00:36:22.613
ACROSS PROGRAM AREAS THE FOUR

00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:23.948
POINT ONE BILLION JUST TO

00:36:24.015 --> 00:36:25.216
CONNECT THE DOTS HERE THE FOUR

00:36:25.283 --> 00:36:27.151
POINT ONE BILLION IS THE SON OF

00:36:27.218 --> 00:36:28.286
THE ONE POINT FOUR BILLION AN-

00:36:28.352 --> 00:36:30.588
ONGOING SPENDING PLUS THE- TWO

00:36:30.655 --> 00:36:31.822
POINT SEVEN BILLION AND ONE

00:36:31.889 --> 00:36:33.791
TIME. SPENDING PROPOSED BY THE

00:36:33.858 --> 00:36:35.860
GOVERNOR THAT WORK THAT I

00:36:35.927 --> 00:36:37.495
MENTIONED ON THE PREVIOUS SLIDE.

00:36:37.562 --> 00:36:39.931
AT A HIGH LEVEL THE ONE TIME

00:36:39.997 --> 00:36:43.000
SPENDING IS CONCENTRATED AND-

00:36:43.067 --> 00:36:45.369
THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS TO

00:36:45.436 --> 00:36:47.838
ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS. WE'RE AS

00:36:47.905 --> 00:36:49.941
THE GOVERNOR'S ONGOING PROPOSE

00:36:50.007 --> 00:36:51.542
SPENDING WOULD GO TOWARD HIGHER

00:36:51.609 --> 00:36:53.277
EDUCATION AND HEALTHCARE

00:36:53.344 --> 00:36:56.213
PROPOSALS. AND IF YOU THINK

00:36:56.280 --> 00:36:57.415
ABOUT WHAT I SAID ON THE

00:36:57.481 --> 00:36:59.350
PREVIOUS PAGE ABOUT HOW-

00:36:59.417 --> 00:37:00.918
THERE'S A HIGH NUMBER OF STE

00:37:00.985 --> 00:37:02.587
RELATIVELY SMALLER PROGRAM

00:37:02.653 --> 00:37:05.556
PROPOSALS THIS IN OUR VIEW THIS

00:37:05.623 --> 00:37:06.791
THIS PRESENTS SOMEWHAT OF A

00:37:06.857 --> 00:37:08.125
TRADE OFF FOR THE LEGISLATURE

00:37:08.192 --> 00:37:10.161
WOULD YOU RATHER DO THAT OR

00:37:10.227 --> 00:37:11.295
WOULD YOU RATHER PURSUE A

00:37:11.362 --> 00:37:13.331
SMALLER NUMBER BUT LARGER

00:37:13.397 --> 00:37:14.298
TICKET ITEMS SO THAT'S SORT OF

00:37:14.365 --> 00:37:15.933
A CHOICE THAT THE LEGISLATURE

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:16.834
WILL HAVE THROUGHOUT THE BUDGET

00:37:16.901 --> 00:37:19.337
PROCESS. ANOTHER POINT THAT WE

00:37:19.403 --> 00:37:20.371
WOULD MAKE ABOUT THE PROPOSAL

00:37:20.438 --> 00:37:24.642
IS THAT SOME OF THE- CONCEPTS-

00:37:24.709 --> 00:37:25.610
PUT FORWARD IN THE IN THE

00:37:25.676 --> 00:37:26.911
BUDGET PACKAGE HAVE THE

00:37:26.978 --> 00:37:28.613
POTENTIAL TO EXERT UPWARD

00:37:28.679 --> 00:37:29.814
PRESSURE ON THE STATE'S COST

00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:31.382
STRUCTURE OVER THE LONG TERM IN

00:37:31.449 --> 00:37:33.150
WAYS THAT ARE NOT ACCOUNTED FOR

00:37:33.217 --> 00:37:36.420
IN THESE ESTIMATES. SO YOU KNOW

00:37:36.487 --> 00:37:38.289
THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE WHERE

00:37:38.356 --> 00:37:39.724
THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES FOR THE

00:37:39.790 --> 00:37:43.494
STATE TO- ENGAGE IN ACTIVITIES

00:37:43.561 --> 00:37:46.364
THAT ARE SORT OF NEW NEW TO THE

00:37:46.430 --> 00:37:47.264
STATE GOVERNMENT FOR EXAMPLE

00:37:47.331 --> 00:37:50.267
AND- PRESCRIPTION DRUGS OR

00:37:50.334 --> 00:37:52.403
CHANGING THE SCOPE OR MISSION

00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:53.137
OF SOME OF THE STATE

00:37:53.204 --> 00:37:56.574
DEPARTMENT'S ANOTHER. BABY

00:37:56.641 --> 00:37:57.508
MERRICK TO THESE TO THESE IDEA.

00:37:57.575 --> 00:37:58.576
BUT WE JUST DON'T HAVE ENOUGH

00:37:58.643 --> 00:38:00.311
INFORMATION AT THIS POINT TO

00:38:00.378 --> 00:38:02.880
SAY THAT IT WOULDN'T. LEAD TO

00:38:02.947 --> 00:38:04.348
HIGHER COSTS DOWN THE ROAD FOR

00:38:04.415 --> 00:38:07.118
THE STATE ON AN ONGOING BASIS

00:38:07.184 --> 00:38:07.718
SO I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING TO

00:38:07.785 --> 00:38:11.022
KEEP IN MIND. MOVING TO SLIDE

00:38:11.088 --> 00:38:13.858
FOR HERE WE'RE LOOKING AT THE-

00:38:13.924 --> 00:38:16.560
CONDITION OF THE BUDGET- OVER

00:38:16.627 --> 00:38:19.230
THE RECENT YEARS IN IS- AS HE

00:38:19.296 --> 00:38:21.232
IS BEEN SAID. RESERVES ARE AT

00:38:21.298 --> 00:38:23.167
HISTORICALLY HIGH LEVELS ARE A

00:38:23.234 --> 00:38:25.169
RESERVE FIGURES TWENTY POINT

00:38:25.236 --> 00:38:26.270
FIVE BILLION IN TOTAL UNDER

00:38:26.337 --> 00:38:28.606
THE- UNDER THE- GOVERNOR'S

00:38:28.673 --> 00:38:30.775
PROPOSED BUDGET FOR TWENTY

00:38:30.841 --> 00:38:33.277
TWENTY TWENTY ONE- IS ONE THING

00:38:33.344 --> 00:38:35.012
THAT WE NOTE IN THIS PACKAGE IS

00:38:35.079 --> 00:38:36.614
THAT. IN A DEPARTURE FROM

00:38:36.681 --> 00:38:38.049
PRACTICE TAKING IN RECENT

00:38:38.115 --> 00:38:39.717
BUDGETS THE GOVERNOR DOES NOT

00:38:39.784 --> 00:38:42.953
PROPOSED TO. SET IT USE. THE

00:38:43.020 --> 00:38:44.588
THIS SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF THE

00:38:44.655 --> 00:38:46.791
ESTIMATED SURPLUS TO BUILD UP

00:38:46.857 --> 00:38:48.292
THE STATE'S DISCRETIONARY

00:38:48.359 --> 00:38:51.629
RESERVES. THAT SAID PROPOSITION

00:38:51.696 --> 00:38:53.931
TWO CONTINUES TO DO ITS JOB AND

00:38:53.998 --> 00:38:55.733
IS LEADING TO ADDITIONAL

00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:56.834
DEPOSITS INTO THE BUDGET

00:38:56.901 --> 00:38:58.436
STABILIZATION ACCOUNT AND

00:38:58.502 --> 00:38:59.704
THAT'S WHY YOU SEE THAT FIGURE

00:38:59.770 --> 00:39:02.039
GROWING OVER THE YEARS SHOWN IN

00:39:02.106 --> 00:39:08.345
THE TABLE. PAGE FIVE IS HERE-

00:39:08.412 --> 00:39:12.850
THIS SLIDE IS SHOWING YOU HOW

00:39:12.917 --> 00:39:14.185
WE DISPLAY ESTIMATES OF THE

00:39:14.251 --> 00:39:16.287
GOVERNOR'S A SPENDING PLAN

00:39:16.353 --> 00:39:18.956
ACROSS THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS.

00:39:19.023 --> 00:39:19.423
WHAT I WOULD DRAW YOUR

00:39:19.490 --> 00:39:21.058
ATTENTION TO IS THE DARKER

00:39:21.125 --> 00:39:22.693
PORTIONS OF THOSE BARS THOSE

00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:24.895
ARE THE OPERATING SURPLUSES AND

00:39:24.962 --> 00:39:26.330
WHAT I WOULD SAY ABOUT THOSE IS

00:39:26.397 --> 00:39:28.833
THAT WHILE THEY REMAIN POSITIVE

00:39:28.899 --> 00:39:29.867
THROUGHOUT THE MULTI YEAR

00:39:29.934 --> 00:39:32.269
OUTLOOK THE OPERATING SURPLUSES

00:39:32.336 --> 00:39:35.206
ARE SMALL. AND MOREOVER THEY

00:39:35.272 --> 00:39:36.607
DEPEND ON SEVERAL KEY

00:39:36.674 --> 00:39:39.210
ASSUMPTIONS HOLDING ONE IS THAT

00:39:39.276 --> 00:39:41.779
THE ECONOMY CONTINUES TO GROW.

00:39:41.846 --> 00:39:43.247
TO THE SECOND AREA IS THAT THE

00:39:43.314 --> 00:39:45.416
FEDERAL REGULATORS APPROVED A

00:39:45.483 --> 00:39:47.618
MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATION TAX.

00:39:47.685 --> 00:39:55.459
pSUSPENSIONS THAT. THAT WERE

00:39:55.526 --> 00:39:57.461
INCLUDED IN THE BUDGET- FOR THE

00:39:57.528 --> 00:39:59.463
CURRENT YEAR DO TAKE EFFECT

00:39:59.530 --> 00:40:02.433
THEY WOULD TAKE EFFECT IN

00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:03.000
TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR AND

00:40:03.067 --> 00:40:04.535
THAT'S WHY YOU SEE A SOMEWHAT

00:40:04.602 --> 00:40:07.705
LARGER- SIR- OPERATINGSURPLUS

00:40:07.772 --> 00:40:09.206
IN THAT YEAR I WOULD JUST POINT

00:40:09.273 --> 00:40:10.741
OUT THOUGH THAT IF THOSE SIR IF

00:40:10.808 --> 00:40:12.576
THOSE SUSPENSIONS DID NOT TAKE

00:40:12.643 --> 00:40:15.579
EFFECT IN THAT FINAL YEAR THEN

00:40:15.646 --> 00:40:16.147
THERE WOULD BE AN OPERATING

00:40:16.213 --> 00:40:18.916
DEFICIT. SO THAT'S JUST

00:40:18.983 --> 00:40:21.485
SOMETHING TO BE COGNIZANT OF.

00:40:21.552 --> 00:40:24.121
ON THE ON THE LAST PAGE I JUST

00:40:24.188 --> 00:40:25.689
WANTED TO LEAVE A COUPLE OF

00:40:25.756 --> 00:40:27.491
FINAL OVER ARCHING THOUGHTS

00:40:27.558 --> 00:40:29.860
HERE ONE IS THAT WE THINK THAT

00:40:29.927 --> 00:40:31.328
THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO

00:40:31.395 --> 00:40:33.164
BEGIN THE PROCESS HERE OF JUST

00:40:33.230 --> 00:40:34.465
THINKING ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT

00:40:34.532 --> 00:40:36.100
IT'S SATISFIED WITH THE LEVEL

00:40:36.167 --> 00:40:38.035
OVERALL LEVEL OF RESERVES

00:40:38.102 --> 00:40:39.870
PROPOSED HERE BY THE GOVERNOR.

00:40:39.937 --> 00:40:41.572
AND THE OTHER CONSIDERATION IS

00:40:41.639 --> 00:40:44.108
THAT- WE SAID IN OUR NOVEMBER

00:40:44.175 --> 00:40:48.412
FISCAL OUTLOOK THAT THE- THAT

00:40:48.479 --> 00:40:49.914
WE CAN WE HAD A KIND OF A

00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:51.749
RECOMMENDED LEVEL OF NEW

00:40:51.816 --> 00:40:53.984
ONGOING SPENDING OF ABOUT ONE

00:40:54.051 --> 00:40:54.885
BILLION DOLLARS THE PROPOSAL

00:40:54.952 --> 00:40:56.587
HERE GOES A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

00:40:56.654 --> 00:40:57.588
THAT IT'S ONE POINT FOUR

00:40:57.655 --> 00:40:58.956
BILLION GROWING TO ONE BULLET

00:40:59.023 --> 00:41:01.258
POINT EIGHT BILLION OVER TIME.

00:41:01.325 --> 00:41:02.393
AND THE CONSEQUENCE OF THAT IS

00:41:02.459 --> 00:41:04.261
THAT THAT CONTRIBUTES TO THE

00:41:04.328 --> 00:41:06.197
VERY SMALL OPERATING SURPLUSES

00:41:06.263 --> 00:41:07.598
IN THE THROUGHOUT THE MULTI

00:41:07.665 --> 00:41:10.801
YEAR PERIOD. AND IN SO FAR AS

00:41:10.868 --> 00:41:12.903
THE LEGISLATURE DID NOT WANT TO

00:41:12.970 --> 00:41:14.772
BUILD LARGER DISCRETIONARY

00:41:14.839 --> 00:41:16.473
RESERVES SIT IN THE WAY THAT

00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:19.877
THE GOVERNOR IS PROPOSING THEN-

00:41:19.944 --> 00:41:21.278
AN ALTERNATIVE CONSIDERATION

00:41:21.345 --> 00:41:22.713
WOULD BE TO MAINTAIN LARGER

00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:25.115
OPERATING SURPLUSES WE THINK

00:41:25.182 --> 00:41:27.885
PRESERVING- BUILDING CONTINUING

00:41:27.952 --> 00:41:29.353
TO BUILD FISCAL RESILIENCE IS

00:41:29.420 --> 00:41:31.055
PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT AT THIS

00:41:31.121 --> 00:41:33.791
TIME. THE NO ONE CAN TELL US

00:41:33.858 --> 00:41:34.491
FOR SURE WHEN THE NEXT

00:41:34.558 --> 00:41:36.393
RECESSION WILL OCCUR BUT WE DO

00:41:36.460 --> 00:41:38.395
KNOW THAT THE CURRENT EXPANSION

00:41:38.462 --> 00:41:39.930
IS QUITE MATURE WE'RE IN THE

00:41:39.997 --> 00:41:41.165
ELEVENTH YEAR OF AN ECONOMIC

00:41:41.232 --> 00:41:43.300
EXPANSION AND SO WHETHER IT'S-

00:41:43.367 --> 00:41:45.102
HIGHER RESERVES WERE. HOLDING

00:41:45.169 --> 00:41:46.804
ON IN PRESERVING A SOMEWHAT

00:41:46.871 --> 00:41:49.039
LARGER OPERATING SURPLUS THOSE

00:41:49.106 --> 00:41:51.175
WOULD BE- WAYS TO YOU KNOW

00:41:51.242 --> 00:41:53.143
UNDER UNDER SCORE- THE STATE'S

00:41:53.210 --> 00:41:55.112
FISCAL RESILIENCE AND YOU MAY

00:41:55.179 --> 00:41:59.250

QUESTIONS FOR THE D. O. F. AND

00:42:57.041 --> 00:42:59.610
ONE FOR THE LA YOU KNOW BUT-

00:42:59.677 --> 00:43:00.377
LET ME FREE MY QUESTIONS BY

00:43:00.444 --> 00:43:02.780
SAYING THAT I REMAIN VERY

00:43:02.846 --> 00:43:04.648
CONCERNED ABOUT THE OVERALL

00:43:04.715 --> 00:43:06.951
LEVEL OF SPENDING INCREASE

00:43:07.017 --> 00:43:09.186
THAT'S CONTAINED IN THIS BUDGET

00:43:09.253 --> 00:43:11.989
PROPOSAL. IF YOU DO THE MATH

00:43:12.056 --> 00:43:14.224
AND YOU COMPARE. THIS PROPOSED

00:43:14.291 --> 00:43:15.993
BUDGET COMPARED WITH WHAT THE

00:43:16.060 --> 00:43:17.361
GOVERNOR PROPOSED TWELVE MONTHS

00:43:17.428 --> 00:43:19.196
AGO WHICH I THINK IS. THE BEST

00:43:19.263 --> 00:43:21.065
APPLES TO APPLES COMPARISON

00:43:21.131 --> 00:43:23.434
IT'S OVER 6% INCREASE AND I

00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:24.802
KNOW THAT THE FIRST PAGE OF THE

00:43:24.868 --> 00:43:26.537
PROPOSED BUDGET SAYS IT'S ONLY

00:43:26.603 --> 00:43:27.104
OVER A LITTLE BIT OVER TWO

00:43:27.171 --> 00:43:28.372
PERCENT. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

00:43:28.439 --> 00:43:29.773
TO NOTE THAT THAT'S COMPARED

00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:31.141
WITH THE FINAL BUDGET FOR LAST

00:43:31.208 --> 00:43:32.509
YEAR NOT THE PROPOSED BUDGET SO

00:43:32.576 --> 00:43:34.178
IF YOU COMPARE APPLES TO APPLES

00:43:34.244 --> 00:43:35.713
IT'S ABOUT TWICE THE RATE OF

00:43:35.779 --> 00:43:36.547
INFLATION WHICH I THINK IS

00:43:36.613 --> 00:43:38.349
ALARMING- AND I ALSO AM

00:43:38.415 --> 00:43:39.516
CONCERNED WITH THE GROWTH OF

00:43:39.583 --> 00:43:40.918
STATE BUREAUCRACY IN THIS

00:43:40.985 --> 00:43:42.086
BUDGET WE WERE COUNTING. THE

00:43:42.152 --> 00:43:42.686
NUMBER OF NEW STATE

00:43:42.753 --> 00:43:44.688
BUREAUCRACIES THAT ARE CREATED

00:43:44.755 --> 00:43:46.256
AS PART OF THE PROPOSAL AND WE

00:43:46.323 --> 00:43:48.025
STOPPED AT TWENTY FIVE BECAUSE

00:43:48.092 --> 00:43:49.526
OF THOSE THOSE THE ONES WE CAN

00:43:49.593 --> 00:43:52.062
IDENTIFY SO- AT. THE IN IN A

00:43:52.129 --> 00:43:53.330
QUESTION FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:43:53.397 --> 00:43:55.032
FINANCE- FOLLOWING UP ON WHAT

00:43:55.099 --> 00:43:57.534
MR OF PANIC JUST TALKED ABOUT

00:43:57.601 --> 00:43:59.570
ABOUT OPERATING SURPLUS. THE

00:43:59.636 --> 00:44:03.273
GOVERNOR HAS PROPOSED TO NOT

00:44:03.340 --> 00:44:04.775
PUT ANY NEW MONEY IN

00:44:04.842 --> 00:44:06.977
DISCRETIONARY RESEARCH IN THIS

00:44:07.044 --> 00:44:08.812
BUDGET SO WE'RE INCREASING THE

00:44:08.879 --> 00:44:09.380
DISCRETIONARY PORTION OF THE

00:44:09.446 --> 00:44:10.314
REST WAS BUT NO NEW

00:44:10.381 --> 00:44:14.685
DISCRETIONARY RESERVES. AND LA

00:44:14.752 --> 00:44:16.954
LA WAS POINTED OUT. THAT I'M

00:44:17.021 --> 00:44:18.222
GOING SPENDING COMMITMENT IS TO

00:44:18.288 --> 00:44:20.691
ELIMINATE OUR- SURPLUS I. WOULD

00:44:20.758 --> 00:44:22.826
BE MORE PRUDENT TO FOCUS ON.

00:44:22.893 --> 00:44:24.995
BUILDING THOSE RESERVES. NOW WE

00:44:25.062 --> 00:44:26.764
KNOW WHEN WE HAVE AN OPERATING

00:44:26.830 --> 00:44:29.533
SURPLUS AND WE HAVE. A SUCH A

00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:32.169
LARGE OF SURPLUS IN- IN

00:44:32.236 --> 00:44:35.506
TAXPAYER DOLLARS. THE FIRST

00:44:35.572 --> 00:44:37.741
POINT I WANT TO MAKE IS THAT-

00:44:37.808 --> 00:44:39.810
THE LA A DETENTION OF THOSE

00:44:39.877 --> 00:44:41.345
OPERATING SURPLUSES UNIFIED

00:44:41.412 --> 00:44:42.980
OVER TIME- ALTHOUGH THE NAY

00:44:43.047 --> 00:44:44.114
INCREASE IN THE LAST YEAR

00:44:44.181 --> 00:44:44.681
BECAUSE OF A SUSPENDED

00:44:44.748 --> 00:44:46.250
PROGRAMS. BUT I THINK IT'S

00:44:46.316 --> 00:44:47.718
IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT DIES

00:44:47.785 --> 00:44:49.119
IT'S PRETTY RARE IN THE LAST

00:44:49.186 --> 00:44:51.088
COUPLE OF YEARS- FOR GOVERNOR

00:44:51.155 --> 00:44:52.189
TO PROPOSE ARE FOR THE

00:44:52.256 --> 00:44:54.024
LEGISLATURE TO ENACT A BUDGET

00:44:54.091 --> 00:44:54.758
THAT HAS THAT KIND OF

00:44:54.825 --> 00:44:55.893
STRUCTURAL BALANCE NOT ONLY THE

00:44:55.959 --> 00:44:57.194
BUDGET YEAR BUTTONS FOR YEARS

00:44:57.261 --> 00:44:59.630
FOLLOWING BACK SO- SO THE FACT

00:44:59.696 --> 00:45:01.298
IS THAT ALTHOUGH IN SOME OF

00:45:01.365 --> 00:45:02.466
THOSE YEARS OPERATING SURPLUSES

00:45:02.533 --> 00:45:04.068
LOW. IT STILL IS A POSITIVE

00:45:04.134 --> 00:45:05.869
BALANCE AND THAT GOES BEYOND

00:45:05.936 --> 00:45:06.837
WHAT IS REQUIRED BY THE

00:45:06.904 --> 00:45:08.906
CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION BALLOTS

00:45:08.972 --> 00:45:09.907
FOR THE CURRENT YEAR SO WE DO

00:45:09.973 --> 00:45:11.608
SEE BALLOTS IN THOSE BACK

00:45:11.675 --> 00:45:13.577
SEVERAL YEARS I THINK THE NEXT

00:45:13.644 --> 00:45:15.112
POINT ON MAY BE IS- ALTHOUGH

00:45:15.179 --> 00:45:16.413
THIS BUDGET DOESN'T MAKE A

00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:18.015
DISCRETIONARY. ADDITIONAL

00:45:18.082 --> 00:45:19.483
RESERVE COMMITMENTS IN ALL THE

00:45:19.550 --> 00:45:20.884
WAYS THAT WE GET IN LAST YEAR'S

00:45:20.951 --> 00:45:22.119
ENACTED BUDGET TO THE SAFETY

00:45:22.186 --> 00:45:25.089
NET RESERVE- IDEA TO OTHERS. IT

00:45:25.155 --> 00:45:26.023
IS STILL PUTTING UNDER

00:45:26.090 --> 00:45:28.425
PROPOSITION TWO AS THE LA-

00:45:28.492 --> 00:45:29.326
NINETEEN TWO BILLION ADDITIONAL

00:45:29.393 --> 00:45:32.329
DOLLARS SO THE RAINY DAY FUND A

00:45:32.396 --> 00:45:32.963
SIXTEEN BILLION DOLLARS THAT'S

00:45:33.030 --> 00:45:34.531
OUR CURRENT PROJECTION OF LAST

00:45:34.598 --> 00:45:35.966
YEAR'S BUDGET ACT IT'S GOING TO

00:45:36.033 --> 00:45:37.401
BE EIGHTEEN BILLION DOLLARS

00:45:37.468 --> 00:45:38.168
THAT'S OUR PROJECTION OVER

00:45:38.235 --> 00:45:40.437
HERE- I ALREADY MENTIONED THE

00:45:40.504 --> 00:45:41.839
ACCELERATION OF THE PENSION

00:45:41.905 --> 00:45:42.840
PAYMENTS THAT SHOULD HELP TO

00:45:42.906 --> 00:45:44.408
SAVE. SOME MONEY AND THEN I

00:45:44.475 --> 00:45:45.442
THINK THE LAST THING I'LL SAY

00:45:45.509 --> 00:45:46.877
IS UNDER PROPOSITION TWO

00:45:46.944 --> 00:45:48.145
THEY'RE ALL THESE REQUIRED DEBT

00:45:48.212 --> 00:45:50.347
PAYMENTS AND SO IN THE OUT

00:45:50.414 --> 00:45:51.715
YEARS TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR

00:45:51.782 --> 00:45:53.016
WE'RE PROJECTING AN ADDITIONAL

00:45:53.083 --> 00:45:54.918
ONE. ONE BILLION DOLLARS IT'S

00:45:54.985 --> 00:45:57.154
ON ALLOCATED AND OUR PROPOSAL I

00:45:57.221 --> 00:46:00.157
SENT CALPERS AS SUPPLEMENTAL SO

00:46:00.224 --> 00:46:01.592
WE UNDERSTAND THE RISKS AND I

00:46:01.658 --> 00:46:03.360
THINK THE LAST POINT ON NAY- TO

00:46:03.427 --> 00:46:04.761
YOUR POINT ABOUT THE GROWTH IN

00:46:04.828 --> 00:46:06.430
STATE SPENDING. ONE OF THE

00:46:06.497 --> 00:46:07.664
THINGS THAT WAS A CONSTRAINT AS

00:46:07.731 --> 00:46:08.432
WE WERE WALKING THROUGH THE

00:46:08.499 --> 00:46:10.033
BUDGET PROCESS IS IF YOU LOOK

00:46:10.100 --> 00:46:11.568
AT OUR PROJECTED RAP MUSIC

00:46:11.635 --> 00:46:13.203
TRANSFERS FOR EACH OF THE NEXT

00:46:13.270 --> 00:46:14.738
SUBSEQUENT FOUR YEARS AGO THE

00:46:14.805 --> 00:46:15.906
BUDGET YEAR AND THREE YEARS

00:46:15.973 --> 00:46:18.108
AFTER THAT. THE RATE OF GROWTH

00:46:18.175 --> 00:46:19.543
IN REVENUES IS A LOWER EACH

00:46:19.610 --> 00:46:21.245
YEAR THAN THE YEAR BEFORE SO

00:46:21.311 --> 00:46:24.982
IT'S LOWER IN 202-120-2220

00:46:25.048 --> 00:46:25.616
TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND EACH YEAR

00:46:25.682 --> 00:46:27.818
FOLLOWING IT IT REDUCES AND SO.

00:46:27.885 --> 00:46:29.186
IF WE WANTED TO PROPOSE A

00:46:29.253 --> 00:46:30.320
STRUCTURALLY BALANCED BUDGET

00:46:30.387 --> 00:46:38.328
WHICH WE DAY WE. HAVE TO

00:46:38.395 --> 00:46:38.829
ACCOMMODATE THAT IN THE

00:46:38.896 --> 00:46:43.100
EXPENDITURES. WITH THE JAPANESE

00:46:43.167 --> 00:46:44.635
ONE. SURE I THINK WORD FURY

00:46:44.701 --> 00:46:45.903
AGREEMENT ON ALMOST YOU BUT I

00:46:45.969 --> 00:46:46.803
WE'RE WE HAVE A DIFFERENCE

00:46:46.870 --> 00:46:47.471
OPINION JUST IS WHETHER NOT WE

00:46:47.538 --> 00:46:48.438
SHOULD JUST COMMITTEE ABOUT TO

00:46:48.505 --> 00:46:49.673
RESERVE THAT LAW REQUIRES HICH

00:46:49.740 --> 00:46:50.941
IS WHY THE- PER. OR WERE WE

00:46:51.008 --> 00:46:51.742
SHOULD AS WE DID LAST YEAR

00:46:51.808 --> 00:46:53.610
CONTRIBUTES I'M EXTRA TO

00:46:53.677 --> 00:46:55.579
RESERVES RECOGNIZING THE FACT

00:46:55.646 --> 00:46:57.347
THAT HAS MISTER PETTIT POINTED

00:46:57.414 --> 00:47:00.517
OUTWARD IN THE- THE WELL I LIVE

00:47:00.584 --> 00:47:02.019
IN FEAR OF OUR CURRENT ECONOMIC

00:47:02.085 --> 00:47:02.886
EXPANSION WHICH MAKES IT THE

00:47:02.953 --> 00:47:05.088
LONGEST IN CALIFORNIA STATE

00:47:05.155 --> 00:47:05.889
HISTORY AT LEAST SINCE WORLD

00:47:05.956 --> 00:47:07.925
WAR TWO SO I THINK THAT'S

00:47:07.991 --> 00:47:10.027
THAT'S- WHAT I'M ASKING ABOUT A

00:47:10.093 --> 00:47:11.428
NIGHT. I KNOW THIS IS THE START

00:47:11.495 --> 00:47:12.696
OF OUR SIX MONTH LONG

00:47:12.763 --> 00:47:14.464
DISCUSSION HERE I'M VERY

00:47:14.531 --> 00:47:15.699
HOPEFUL THAT PERHAPS WE CAN SEE

00:47:15.766 --> 00:47:19.236
OUR WAY TO GETTING MORE OF A

00:47:19.303 --> 00:47:19.836
PLACE WHERE WE WERE LAST YEAR

00:47:19.903 --> 00:47:21.305
WE'RE WE'RE SETTING ASIDE SOME

00:47:21.371 --> 00:47:25.375
DISCRETIONARY. HI AND ON THAT.

00:47:25.442 --> 00:47:26.176
FOR THE LA I REQUEST ABOUT OUR

00:47:26.243 --> 00:47:27.544
RESERVE LEVELS. THE

00:47:27.611 --> 00:47:28.946
ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL WOULD

00:47:29.012 --> 00:47:30.781
END THIS FISCAL YEAR WITH A

00:47:30.847 --> 00:47:31.815
LITTLE OVER TWENTY BILLION

00:47:31.882 --> 00:47:34.017
DOLLARS IN RESERVES- YOU HAVE

00:47:34.084 --> 00:47:36.253
CREATED A RECESSION SCENARIO

00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:37.287
FORECAST IS PART OF YOUR

00:47:37.354 --> 00:47:39.289
ANALYSIS. THAT SHOWS THAT WE

00:47:39.356 --> 00:47:41.458
WOULD HAVE A REVENUE SHORTFALL

00:47:41.525 --> 00:47:42.593
OF ABOUT SEVENTY BILLION

00:47:42.659 --> 00:47:43.961
DOLLARS. IN A MODERATE

00:47:44.027 --> 00:47:45.862
RECESSION WITH AN ACTUAL

00:47:45.929 --> 00:47:47.698
DEFICIT OF ABOUT SIX FORTY

00:47:47.764 --> 00:47:49.099
BILLION DOLLARS BECAUSE A PROP

00:47:49.166 --> 00:47:50.100
NINETY EIGHT. AND SOME OTHER

00:47:50.167 --> 00:47:51.768
THINGS SO MY QUESTION FOR YOU

00:47:51.835 --> 00:47:53.303
IS WHAT WOULD BE A PRUDENT

00:47:53.370 --> 00:47:54.972
LEVEL OF RESERVES. FOR US TO

00:47:55.038 --> 00:47:56.506
SEEK BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THERE'S

00:47:56.573 --> 00:47:57.774
NO POINT IN PUTTING ASIDE TOO

00:47:57.841 --> 00:47:58.442
MUCH WHAT WE WANT TO BE

00:47:58.508 --> 00:48:00.043
PRUDENT. AND PUT ASIDE ENOUGH

00:48:00.110 --> 00:48:02.246
THAT'S REQUIRED FOR US TO BE

00:48:02.312 --> 00:48:03.447
ABLE TO PROVIDE THE STATE'S

00:48:03.513 --> 00:48:05.148
SERVICES THEIR CRITICAL IN A

00:48:05.215 --> 00:48:07.084
RECESSION WITHOUT RUNNING A

00:48:07.150 --> 00:48:08.352
BUDGET DEFICIT. SO OFTEN ARE WE

00:48:08.418 --> 00:48:10.254
THERE ARE WE HALFWAY THERE-

00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:12.222
WOULD YOU THINK WE OUGHT TO BE

00:48:12.289 --> 00:48:13.824
DOING MOVING FORWARD THANK YOU

00:48:13.890 --> 00:48:18.228
FOR THE- I. WOULD SAY THAT IN%

00:48:18.295 --> 00:48:20.264
OUR RECESSION SCENARIO FROM

00:48:20.330 --> 00:48:22.399
THIS- PAST FALL IN NOVEMBER

00:48:22.466 --> 00:48:23.700
THERE'S A COUPLE OF KEY

00:48:23.767 --> 00:48:26.003
ASSUMPTIONS THAT GO INTO IT THE

00:48:26.069 --> 00:48:28.705
FIRST IS THAT WE ARE STARTING

00:48:28.772 --> 00:48:31.575
WITH SORT OF THE BASELINE

00:48:31.642 --> 00:48:33.043
BEFORE THIS CURRENT BUDGET

00:48:33.110 --> 00:48:34.578
PROCESS SO WE'RE KIND OF

00:48:34.645 --> 00:48:36.346
INCORPORATING WHAT THE FISCAL

00:48:36.413 --> 00:48:37.648
POSITION OF THE STATE WILL BE

00:48:37.714 --> 00:48:39.049
AT THE END OF THE FISCAL YEAR

00:48:39.116 --> 00:48:41.018
ASSUMING THERE ARE NO ADDITIONS

00:48:41.084 --> 00:48:44.121
TO- THE STATE'S COMMITMENT SO

00:48:44.187 --> 00:48:48.058
YOU. TO THE EXTENT THAT THE

00:48:48.125 --> 00:48:49.393
LEGISLATURE APPROVED A NEW NEW

00:48:49.459 --> 00:48:51.862
ANSWER BUDGET WOULD REDUCE THE

00:48:51.928 --> 00:48:53.864
BUDGET CAPACITY TO WITHSTAND A

00:48:53.930 --> 00:48:56.566
RECESSION- AS FOR YOUR

00:48:56.633 --> 00:48:57.834
FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION ABOUT

00:48:57.901 --> 00:48:59.269
WHETHER OR NOT THE STATE IS

00:48:59.336 --> 00:49:00.470
PREPARED I MEAN IT REALLY

00:49:00.537 --> 00:49:03.106
DEPENDS ON THE SEVERITY OF THE

00:49:03.173 --> 00:49:05.609
DOWNTURN THE SIZE OF OUR

00:49:05.676 --> 00:49:07.344
RESERVES AND OUR LEVEL OF

00:49:07.411 --> 00:49:08.745
SPENDING RELATIVE TO OUR

00:49:08.812 --> 00:49:11.415
REVENUES SO DO YOU KNOW THE

00:49:11.481 --> 00:49:13.884
RESERVES CLASS ANY- REVENUES-

00:49:13.950 --> 00:49:15.819
ABOVE ARE SPENDING LEVEL THE

00:49:15.886 --> 00:49:19.022
SURPLUS OR WHAT PROVIDE US WITH

00:49:19.089 --> 00:49:20.791
FISCAL RESILIENCE. TO THE

00:49:20.857 --> 00:49:21.858
EXTENT THE RIVER GO TO. WE

00:49:21.925 --> 00:49:24.661
WOULD NEED TO EITHER MAKE

00:49:24.728 --> 00:49:27.431
PROGRAM CUTS INCREASE REVENUES

00:49:27.497 --> 00:49:29.232
OR YOU KNOW DRAW DOWN ON OUR

00:49:29.299 --> 00:49:30.934
RESERVES I DON'T KNOW THAT I

00:49:31.001 --> 00:49:33.403
CAN. PROVIDE A SATISFACTORY

00:49:33.470 --> 00:49:34.638
ANSWER ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT

00:49:34.705 --> 00:49:36.173
WE'RE PREPARED BECAUSE I THINK

00:49:36.239 --> 00:49:38.342
IN LARGE PART IT DEPENDS ON THE

00:49:38.408 --> 00:49:40.844
RISK TOLERANCE. OF THE DECISION

00:49:40.911 --> 00:49:45.182
MAKERS AND SO- YOU KNOW WHEN WE

00:49:45.248 --> 00:49:46.583
CONDUCTED OUR OUTLOOK IN

00:49:46.650 --> 00:49:47.751
NOVEMBER WE WERE LOOKING AT

00:49:47.818 --> 00:49:49.753
SOMEWHERE IN THE RANGE OF

00:49:49.820 --> 00:49:50.387
TWENTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS OF

00:49:50.454 --> 00:49:52.356
RESERVES AT THE END OF TWENTY

00:49:52.422 --> 00:49:53.323
TWENTY ONE AND YOU KNOW YOU CAN

00:49:53.390 --> 00:49:54.758
SEE HERE THAT WANTS TO THE

00:49:54.825 --> 00:49:57.861
PROPOSAL IS ACCOUNTED FOR IT'S

00:49:57.928 --> 00:49:58.428
A SMALLER AMOUNT IT'S TWENTY

00:49:58.495 --> 00:50:00.764
BILLION. AND SO STILL HIS WE

00:50:00.831 --> 00:50:02.366
WANT TO PROVIDE US SOME VERY

00:50:02.432 --> 00:50:04.434
GOOD CAPACITY WHETHER OR NOT IT

00:50:04.501 --> 00:50:07.304
WOULD BE SUFFICIENT KIND OF

00:50:07.371 --> 00:50:07.871
DEPENDS ON THE NATURE OF THE

00:50:07.938 --> 00:50:11.274
RECESSION. OKAY I THIS IS THE

00:50:11.341 --> 00:50:12.409
START OF A LONG DISCUSSION AND

00:50:12.476 --> 00:50:13.276
I'M SURE WE'RE GONNA HAVE IT

00:50:13.343 --> 00:50:15.345
AGAIN- LET ME MAKE ONE POINT

00:50:15.412 --> 00:50:16.613
THOUGH THIS IS. A JUST

00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:18.014
CONTINUING SOMETHING THAT YOU

00:50:18.081 --> 00:50:18.782
AND I WERE TALKING ABOUT THE

00:50:18.849 --> 00:50:20.550
OTHER DAY. ABOUT THE FACT THAT

00:50:20.617 --> 00:50:23.520
THE CURRENT LA- RECESSION

00:50:23.587 --> 00:50:26.523
SCENARIO INCLUDES. THE

00:50:26.590 --> 00:50:28.325
GOVERNMENT CUTTING. STATE

00:50:28.392 --> 00:50:29.726
SPENDING ON EDUCATION TO THE

00:50:29.793 --> 00:50:30.994
BARE MINIMUM REQUIRED UNDER

00:50:31.061 --> 00:50:33.330
PROP NINETY EIGHT. AND THE LAST

00:50:33.397 --> 00:50:34.765
TIME THAT WE DID THAT AT THE

00:50:34.831 --> 00:50:36.299
STATE LEVEL IT CAUSED.

00:50:36.366 --> 00:50:38.568
WIDESPREAD DAMAGE TO OUR STATE

00:50:38.635 --> 00:50:40.670
WHAT EDUCATION SYSTEM. I DO NOT

00:50:40.737 --> 00:50:42.272
THINK FOR PLANNING PURPOSES

00:50:42.339 --> 00:50:43.774
THAT WE SHOULD BE ASSUMING.

00:50:43.840 --> 00:50:46.410
THAT WE WILL BE CUTTING FUNDING

00:50:46.476 --> 00:50:48.111
FOR EDUCATION. JUST BECAUSE THE

00:50:48.178 --> 00:50:50.280
LAW ALLOWS US TO. AND I WOULD

00:50:50.347 --> 00:50:51.982
HOPE THAT MOVING FORWARD WE

00:50:52.048 --> 00:50:53.884
COULD MAKE A PLAN. THAT WERE WE

00:50:53.950 --> 00:50:55.419
COULD RATHER WHETHER RECESSION

00:50:55.485 --> 00:50:57.254
WITH OUR RESERVES. I IN A WAY

00:50:57.320 --> 00:50:59.156
THAT INCLUDES FUNDING EDUCATION

00:50:59.222 --> 00:51:00.090
AT THE SAME LEVEL THAT WE HAVE

00:51:00.157 --> 00:51:01.224
BEEN FUNDING IT. RATHER THAN

00:51:01.291 --> 00:51:02.826
CUTTING THAT FINAL STATES

00:51:02.893 --> 00:51:04.995
SERVICE. IN ONE LAST QUESTION

00:51:05.061 --> 00:51:06.797
FOR THE- DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE-

00:51:06.863 --> 00:51:09.032
NEVER. REGARDS THE PROPOSED

00:51:09.099 --> 00:51:11.468
CLIMATE RESILIENCY BOND THAT

00:51:11.535 --> 00:51:13.603
THE GOVERNOR INCLUDED IN THIS

00:51:13.670 --> 00:51:15.272
BUDGET PROPOSAL SO THAT'S A

00:51:15.338 --> 00:51:16.740
FOUR POINT SEVEN FIVE BILLION

00:51:16.807 --> 00:51:18.975
DOLLAR BOND FUND TO FIND A WIDE

00:51:19.042 --> 00:51:20.477
VARIETY OF THINGS MOST OF WHICH

00:51:20.544 --> 00:51:22.045
I FIND VERY SUPPORT BUT MY

00:51:22.112 --> 00:51:24.714
QUESTION IS THIS WE HAVE. A SIX

00:51:24.781 --> 00:51:26.583
BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET SURPLUS

00:51:26.650 --> 00:51:28.485
WHY ON EARTH WOULD WE GO INTO

00:51:28.552 --> 00:51:30.987
DEBT. FIVE FIVE BILLION DOLLARS

00:51:31.054 --> 00:51:31.955
TO FUND THESE PROGRAMS IN A

00:51:32.022 --> 00:51:33.156
YEAR WHEN WE'RE ENJOYING A

00:51:33.223 --> 00:51:34.524
BUDGET SURPLUS IF THESE

00:51:34.591 --> 00:51:35.892
PROGRAMS ARE SUPPORTABLE AND I

00:51:35.959 --> 00:51:37.594
THINK LARGELY THEY ARE. WHY

00:51:37.661 --> 00:51:38.962
WOULD WE NOT JUST PAY THE PAY

00:51:39.029 --> 00:51:40.497
FOR THOSE THINGS PRIORITIZE

00:51:40.564 --> 00:51:42.666
THAT SPENDING AS WE PRIORITIZE

00:51:42.732 --> 00:51:43.767
SPENDING FOR EVERYTHINGELSE

00:51:43.834 --> 00:51:45.969
RATHER THAN PAYING THEM BACK.

00:51:46.036 --> 00:51:47.304
WELL OVER TWENTY YEARS AND

00:51:47.370 --> 00:51:50.507
PUTTING- FUTURE LEGISLATORS ON

00:51:50.574 --> 00:51:52.442
THE HOOK FOR PAY FOR DEBT

00:51:52.509 --> 00:51:54.978
REPAYMENT THAT. SO THREE THREE

00:51:55.045 --> 00:51:56.313
POINTS- ON THAT I THINK THE

00:51:56.379 --> 00:51:58.448
FIRST AS WELL WE DO HAVE THIS.

00:51:58.515 --> 00:51:59.182
FIVE POINT SIX BILLION DOLLAR

00:51:59.249 --> 00:52:00.984
SURPLUS AND THAT'S A BIG NUMBER

00:52:01.051 --> 00:52:02.552
AND WE CAN EXPECT THAT WILL

00:52:02.619 --> 00:52:03.487
HAVE SOMETHING LIKE THAT EVERY

00:52:03.553 --> 00:52:06.089
YEAR. AS THE LA MENTIONED- ONE

00:52:06.156 --> 00:52:07.324
POINT SIX BILLION OF THAT IS

00:52:07.390 --> 00:52:08.992
JUST AN RSS FEED YOU AND THAT'S

00:52:09.059 --> 00:52:10.760
OUR RESERVE ACCOUNT FOR. ANY

00:52:10.827 --> 00:52:12.062
SORTS OF EMERGENCY OR ANYTHING

00:52:12.128 --> 00:52:14.064
ELSE THAT. COMES UP AND IN

00:52:14.130 --> 00:52:15.332
ADDITION TO THAT I SOME

00:52:15.398 --> 00:52:17.000
EXPENDITURES THAT WERE MAKING

00:52:17.067 --> 00:52:18.535
OUT OF THAT SURPLUS OUR

00:52:18.602 --> 00:52:19.803
EXPENDITURES THAT WE REALLY DO

00:52:19.870 --> 00:52:21.271
NEED TO MAKE AND SOME OF THEM-

00:52:21.338 --> 00:52:22.639
ARE ACTUALLY IN THIS AREA OF

00:52:22.706 --> 00:52:24.307
WILDFIRES IN ABOUT SETTING UP.

00:52:24.374 --> 00:52:25.342
PUTTING MORE MONEY INTO CAL

00:52:25.408 --> 00:52:26.743
FIRE THE WILDFIRES RIGHT

00:52:26.810 --> 00:52:28.945
INTEGRATION CENTER- SOLAT IN

00:52:29.012 --> 00:52:30.747
THAT SPACE- SO WHEN YOU

00:52:30.814 --> 00:52:32.415
ACTUALLY THINK ABOUT. WHAT'S

00:52:32.482 --> 00:52:32.949
REALLY NO IT'S ALL

00:52:33.016 --> 00:52:34.784
DISCRETIONARY BUT ONCE YOU

00:52:34.851 --> 00:52:36.253
THINK ABOUT THE EXPENDITURES

00:52:36.319 --> 00:52:37.153
THAT THE GOVERNOR FELT AT LEAST

00:52:37.220 --> 00:52:38.154
WERE VERY IMPORTANT TO THE

00:52:38.221 --> 00:52:40.690
ADMINISTRATION- THERE WASN'T

00:52:40.757 --> 00:52:41.458
FOUR FIVE BILLION DOLLARS

00:52:41.525 --> 00:52:42.959
AVAILABLE JUST FOR THIS ONE SET

00:52:43.026 --> 00:52:44.628
OF ITEMS. I THINK THE SECOND

00:52:44.694 --> 00:52:46.263
POINT THAT I WANT TO MAKE IS

00:52:46.329 --> 00:52:47.597
THAT WE BELIEVE THAT-

00:52:47.664 --> 00:52:50.400
INFRASTRUCTURE I SPENDING- FOR

00:52:50.467 --> 00:52:52.269
ITEMS LIKE THIS- BONDS RGO

00:52:52.335 --> 00:52:54.004
BONDS ARE APPROPRIATE. TO YOUR

00:52:54.070 --> 00:52:56.306
POINT IT IS ALWAYS CHEAPER TO

00:52:56.373 --> 00:52:57.107
PAY IT OUT RIGHT AND TO SELL

00:52:57.173 --> 00:52:58.808
GEO BONDS BECAUSE THERE ARE.

00:52:58.875 --> 00:53:04.614
THERE IS AN. FLOOD PROTECTION

00:53:04.681 --> 00:53:06.816
DROUGHT WATER- COMMUNITY

00:53:06.883 --> 00:53:08.251
HEARTENING THESE ARE THE TYPES

00:53:08.318 --> 00:53:09.185
OF THINGS THAT BONDS ARE

00:53:09.252 --> 00:53:10.520
APPROPRIATE FOR BECAUSE IT IS

00:53:10.587 --> 00:53:11.721
THE CASE AS YOU MENTIONED THAT

00:53:11.788 --> 00:53:13.423
THE BURDEN. WILL BE BORNE BY IN

00:53:13.490 --> 00:53:15.025
FUTURE BUDGETS AS WELL BUT THEY

00:53:15.091 --> 00:53:16.393
WILL ALSO RECEIVE THE BENEFITS

00:53:16.459 --> 00:53:18.194
OF THOSE LONG TERM INVESTMENTS.

00:53:18.261 --> 00:53:19.529
AND THEN THE FINAL POINT I'LL

00:53:19.596 --> 00:53:21.298
MAKE IS YOU KNOW I. CAN'T

00:53:21.364 --> 00:53:22.566
PROFESS TO PROJECT WHERE

00:53:22.632 --> 00:53:24.334
INTEREST RATES ARE GOING IN THE

00:53:24.401 --> 00:53:25.001
FUTURE YOU KNOW WE HAVE OUR

00:53:25.068 --> 00:53:26.570
BEST ESTIMATES BUT AS YOU KNOW

00:53:26.636 --> 00:53:27.470
INTEREST RATES ARE AT A LOWER

00:53:27.537 --> 00:53:29.239
LEVEL. RIGHT NOW THAN THEY HAVE

00:53:29.306 --> 00:53:30.307
SOMETIMES BEEN IN THE LAST

00:53:30.373 --> 00:53:31.908
SEVERAL YEARS OR DECADES SO.

00:53:31.975 --> 00:53:33.476
ALL OTHER THINGS BEING EQUAL WE

00:53:33.543 --> 00:53:34.177
THOUGHT THAT THIS WAS AN

00:53:34.244 --> 00:53:36.680
APPROPRIATE USE OF RESOURCES-

00:53:36.746 --> 00:53:39.049
FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE BOND.

00:53:39.115 --> 00:53:40.884
SO APPRECIATE ANSWER HOW YOU

00:53:40.951 --> 00:53:42.886
AND I DISAGREE ON THAT. I THINK

00:53:42.953 --> 00:53:44.754
THAT. WHEN WE'RE ENJOYING

00:53:44.821 --> 00:53:46.590
BUDGETARY SURPLUS IS THE TIME

00:53:46.656 --> 00:53:47.324
TO MAKE INVESTMENTS IN

00:53:47.390 --> 00:53:48.458
INFRASTRUCTURE WITH CURRENT

00:53:48.525 --> 00:53:49.926
DOLLARS. AND WHEN WE HAVE

00:53:49.993 --> 00:53:52.162
DEFICITS IS THE TIME THAT. WE

00:53:52.228 --> 00:53:53.763
MUST BORROW TO MAKE THOSE

00:53:53.830 --> 00:53:54.998
INVESTMENTS BECAUSE WE DON'T

00:53:55.065 --> 00:53:57.100
HAVE. THE ONGOING FUNDING FOR

00:53:57.167 --> 00:53:57.867
IT AND WE IN THE NEEDS TO

00:53:57.934 --> 00:53:59.603
CONTINUES TO EXIST. FOR THAT

00:53:59.669 --> 00:54:02.072
INFRASTRUCTURE SO- I WOULD.

00:54:02.138 --> 00:54:04.975
MUCH PREFER US TO. NOT GO

00:54:05.041 --> 00:54:06.242
FURTHER IN DEBT IN YEARS WHEN

00:54:06.309 --> 00:54:07.811
WE HAVE A SURPLUS LIKE WE DO.

00:54:07.877 --> 00:54:09.346
THIS YEAR AND ALSO MAKE THE

00:54:09.412 --> 00:54:11.381
POINT THAT. I EVEN AS- YOU

00:54:11.448 --> 00:54:12.749
POINT OUT THAT INTEREST RATES

00:54:12.816 --> 00:54:15.318
ARE- THAT ALMOST A STORE CLOSE

00:54:15.385 --> 00:54:17.354
RIGHT NOW- IT'S STILL THE CASE

00:54:17.420 --> 00:54:18.955
THAT BORROWING THAT MONEY OVER

00:54:19.022 --> 00:54:19.889
TWENTY YEARS IS GOING TO

00:54:19.956 --> 00:54:21.558
REQUIRE. A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT

00:54:21.625 --> 00:54:23.093
OF INTEREST BEFORE IT'S REPAID

00:54:23.159 --> 00:54:25.128
IN FACT. I EVEN A TODAY'S

00:54:25.195 --> 00:54:25.695
INTEREST RATES I THINK IT'S

00:54:25.762 --> 00:54:27.931
OVER EIGHTY PERCENT- EXTRA THAT

00:54:27.998 --> 00:54:28.598
THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO BE

00:54:28.665 --> 00:54:29.899
REQUIRED TO INPUT A DIFFERENT

00:54:29.966 --> 00:54:31.134
WAY WE COULD BUILD. ALMOST

00:54:31.201 --> 00:54:33.003
TWICE AS MUCH NFRASTRUCTURE.

00:54:33.069 --> 00:54:34.371
FOR DOLLAR THAT WE SPEND IF WE

00:54:34.437 --> 00:54:35.839
DO IT ON AN ONGOING BASIS

00:54:35.905 --> 00:54:37.173
RATHER THAN BORROWING. SO I

00:54:37.240 --> 00:54:38.875
WOULD MUCH PREFER THAT WE- THAT

00:54:38.942 --> 00:54:40.377
WE FIND THAT OUT OF. OUR

00:54:40.443 --> 00:54:42.178
ONGOING BASIS. IN YEARS WHEN WE

00:54:42.245 --> 00:54:43.480
HAVE A SURPLUS AS WE DO THIS

00:54:43.546 --> 00:54:44.547
YEAR. BUT I WANT TO THANK YOU

00:54:44.614 --> 00:54:45.949
FOR THE ANSWER- AND LOOK

00:54:46.016 --> 00:54:46.816
FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU

00:54:46.883 --> 00:54:48.018
BOTH- IN THE MONTHS TO COME AS

00:54:48.084 --> 00:54:52.822
WE CRAFT THIS BUDGET. THANKS

THANK YOU. MISS GARCIA. AT

00:54:55.392 --> 00:54:57.794
THANK YOU WANTED- COMMENT AND

00:54:57.861 --> 00:54:59.462
QUESTIONS ON THREE DIFFERENT.

00:54:59.529 --> 00:55:00.730
AREAS IN THE BUDGET THE BOOK

00:55:00.797 --> 00:55:03.700
THE FIRST IS RELATED TO AB SIX

00:55:03.767 --> 00:55:04.334
SEVENTEEN AND OUR COMMUNITY OR

00:55:04.401 --> 00:55:06.836
PROTECTIONS- I SEE THAT THERE

00:55:06.903 --> 00:55:10.373
HAS BEEN. SLIGHT CUT IN IN THIS

00:55:10.440 --> 00:55:12.208
AREA EVEN THOUGH WE'VE ADDED

00:55:12.275 --> 00:55:13.343
FIVE ADDITIONAL COMMUNITIES FOR

00:55:13.410 --> 00:55:14.444
YOUR TO COMMUNITIES FIGHT THAT

00:55:14.511 --> 00:55:15.812
A FINE HOT SPOTS CREATING

00:55:15.879 --> 00:55:17.814
COMMUNITY ACTION PLANS. AND

00:55:17.881 --> 00:55:20.417
THEN IMPLEMENTING THOSE PLANS-

00:55:20.483 --> 00:55:21.685
AND SO JUST WANTED TO KNOW A

00:55:21.751 --> 00:55:22.986
LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE

00:55:23.053 --> 00:55:26.690
RATIONALE THERE FOR THOSE CUTS.

00:55:26.756 --> 00:55:27.957
SO ALL MAKE A BRIEF POINT AND

00:55:28.024 --> 00:55:29.092
THEN MY COLLEAGUE THREE SECOND

00:55:29.159 --> 00:55:30.260
TALK SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THE

00:55:30.326 --> 00:55:31.661
PROGRAMS AT THE GOVERNOR

00:55:31.728 --> 00:55:32.662
PROPOSED IN HIS BUDGET A TWELVE

00:55:32.729 --> 00:55:34.130
AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS

00:55:34.197 --> 00:55:35.832
CLIMATE BUDGET OVER THE NEXT

00:55:35.899 --> 00:55:37.667
FIVE YEARS AND THAT INCLUDES-

00:55:37.734 --> 00:55:39.202
CAP AND TRADE AS YOU MENTIONED

00:55:39.269 --> 00:55:40.804
REVENUE FROM THAT PROGRAMS. AS

00:55:40.870 --> 00:55:42.138
WELL AS THE CLIMATE CATALYST

00:55:42.205 --> 00:55:43.740
FIND AND THEN FINALLY THAT BOND

00:55:43.807 --> 00:55:44.941
FUNDING THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER

OBERNOLTE MENTIONED ARE

00:55:46.843 --> 00:55:47.844
PROJECTION FOR THE CAP AND

00:55:47.911 --> 00:55:49.546
TRADE PROGRAM THIS YEAR IN

00:55:49.612 --> 00:55:50.447
TERMS OF REVENUES THAT ARE

00:55:50.513 --> 00:55:52.082
AVAILABLE TO. IS A LAST THAN IT

00:55:52.148 --> 00:55:54.384
WAS LAST YEAR WE HAD A SURPLUS

00:55:54.451 --> 00:55:55.518
OF FUNDING LAST YEAR THAT WE

00:55:55.585 --> 00:55:56.953
DON'T ANTICIPATE WILL COME.

00:55:57.020 --> 00:56:00.356
THIS YEAR SO WE HAVE TO THINK-ABOUT THE GOVERNOR HAD TO THINK

00:56:00.423 --> 00:56:02.192
ABOUT HOW WE ALLOCATE A SMALLER

00:56:02.258 --> 00:56:03.126
BUCKET OF FUNDING AMONG THE

00:56:03.193 --> 00:56:05.295
DIFFERENT PROGRAMS SB SIX

00:56:05.361 --> 00:56:05.862
SEVENTEEN AND COMMITTEE OR

00:56:05.929 --> 00:56:07.764
PROTECTION STILL IS A BIG

00:56:07.831 --> 00:56:08.264
PRIORITY FOR THE

00:56:08.331 --> 00:56:09.733
ADMINISTRATION. AND ALTERNATE

00:56:09.799 --> 00:56:11.634
OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE TO RESET

00:56:11.701 --> 00:56:12.769
TO SPEAK ABOUT. THREE OUR

00:56:12.836 --> 00:56:14.537
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND- YES

00:56:14.604 --> 00:56:17.040
LAST YEAR COMBINED AB SIX ONE

00:56:17.107 --> 00:56:18.608
SEVEN PROGRAMS TOTALED ABOUT

00:56:18.675 --> 00:56:19.109
TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE

00:56:19.175 --> 00:56:20.877
MILLION FROM THE GT R. F. THIS

00:56:20.944 --> 00:56:22.045
YEAR IT'S TWO HUNDRED AND

00:56:22.112 --> 00:56:23.913
THIRTY FIVE. AND THE PRODUCTION

00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:27.317
WAS TO THE LOCAL PROGRAMS- FROM

00:56:27.383 --> 00:56:27.917
TWO HUNDRED FORTY FIVE MILLION

00:56:27.984 --> 00:56:28.752
TO TWO HUNDRED MILLION PROPOSED

00:56:28.818 --> 00:56:30.487
THIS YEAR. AND THE LOCAL OR

00:56:30.553 --> 00:56:32.021
DISTRICT IMPLEMENTATION-

00:56:32.088 --> 00:56:33.256
ACTUALLY WENT UP BY FIVE

00:56:33.323 --> 00:56:35.125
MILLION FROM TWENTY TO TWENTY

00:56:35.191 --> 00:56:35.692
FIVE AND THEN THE TECHNICAL

00:56:35.759 --> 00:56:36.693
ASSISTANCE TO COMMUNITY GROUPS

00:56:36.760 --> 00:56:37.927
STAY THE SAME AT TEN MILLION

00:56:37.994 --> 00:56:39.429
DOLLARS. BUT A LOT OF THE

00:56:39.496 --> 00:56:41.197
CHANGES AGAIN ATTRIBUTED TO.

00:56:41.264 --> 00:56:42.499
LAST YEAR'S CAP AND TRADE

00:56:42.565 --> 00:56:44.134
FUNDING BEING MUCH HIGHER THAN

00:56:44.200 --> 00:56:45.335
WE HAVE HERE AND FOR

00:56:45.401 --> 00:56:45.935
DISCRETIONARY PROGRAMS THIS

00:56:46.002 --> 00:56:47.771
YEAR. I MEAN AND SO I WOULD SAY

00:56:47.837 --> 00:56:49.606
THAT AB SIX SEVENTEEN DOESN'T

00:56:49.672 --> 00:56:51.007
JUST NEED TO BE. SHOULDN'T JUST

00:56:51.074 --> 00:56:51.875
BE FROM THERE FROM CAP AND

00:56:51.941 --> 00:56:53.109
TRADE WE SHOULD BE THINKING

00:56:53.176 --> 00:56:54.711
ABOUT IT ONLY THING ABOUT. THE

00:56:54.778 --> 00:56:56.546
GOVERNOR'S PLEDGE OF JUSTICE

00:56:56.613 --> 00:56:58.047
FOR ALL. ON A WHEN YOU'RE-

00:56:58.114 --> 00:56:59.716
ABOUT A HOLISTIC. APPROACH

00:56:59.783 --> 00:57:01.284
LOOKING WHAT THAT OUR RESOURCES

00:57:01.351 --> 00:57:03.520
BONDED. AND OTHER ITEMS AND

00:57:03.586 --> 00:57:04.554
THIS ONE BILLION DOLLAR

00:57:04.621 --> 00:57:06.222
CLIMATE. OF INITIATIVE HE

00:57:06.289 --> 00:57:08.591
STARTED- I THINK WHAT'S SPECIAL

00:57:08.658 --> 00:57:10.093
ABOUT EIGHTY SIX SEVENTEEN THAT

00:57:10.160 --> 00:57:11.227
IS TARGETING ANIMALS AFFORDABLE

00:57:11.294 --> 00:57:12.562
COMMUNITIES OR COMMUNITIES THAT

00:57:12.629 --> 00:57:13.563
OFTEN FOR ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE

00:57:13.630 --> 00:57:16.599
HELP. ON AND SO WE IN WE ARE.

00:57:16.666 --> 00:57:18.268
CONTINUOUSLY THE PLAN IS ADDED

00:57:18.334 --> 00:57:19.803
TO THE COMMUNITY AND SO WE CAN

00:57:19.869 --> 00:57:20.703
BE SAYING WELL BECAUSE HE

00:57:20.770 --> 00:57:23.239
EXPECTS LESS PER- PROJECTIONS.

00:57:23.306 --> 00:57:24.774
RAINY MAKING THESE CUTS WITH A

00:57:24.841 --> 00:57:25.542
PROGRAM SUPPOSED TO BE CRYING

00:57:25.608 --> 00:57:27.377
SO I THINK. WHEN YOU LOOK

00:57:27.443 --> 00:57:29.045
BEYOND. CAP AND TRADE. HOW DO

00:57:29.112 --> 00:57:30.713
WE HONOR AND HOW DO WE HONOR

00:57:30.780 --> 00:57:32.048
THE GOVERNOR'S WILL OF JUSTICE

00:57:32.115 --> 00:57:33.917
FOR ALL AND NOT JUST. FOR SOME.

00:57:33.983 --> 00:57:36.085
OUT THERE WITH EIGHTY SIX

00:57:36.152 --> 00:57:36.853
SEVENTEEN AND SO. LIKE I BY

00:57:36.920 --> 00:57:38.288
SURE NATURE HAS ANYWHERE IN THE

00:57:38.354 --> 00:57:40.256
BEGINNING OF LONG NEGOTIATIONS

00:57:40.323 --> 00:57:41.291
BUT I THINK IT'S REALLY

00:57:41.357 --> 00:57:42.125
IMPORTANT THAT WE THINK ABOUT

00:57:42.192 --> 00:57:43.393
OUR COMMITMENTS. THAT WE HAVE

00:57:43.459 --> 00:57:44.494
MADE AND WHAT'S SPECIAL ABOUT

00:57:44.561 --> 00:57:45.829
THESE COMMUNITIES IN THE WORK

00:57:45.895 --> 00:57:48.031
THAT'S BEING DONE HERE- AND I

00:57:48.097 --> 00:57:49.599
THINK WE'RE AT A CRITICAL POINT

00:57:49.666 --> 00:57:50.600
WHICH IS FINISHED THE YEAR ONE

00:57:50.667 --> 00:57:51.968
PLANTS A CERTAIN TO GET IT.

00:57:52.035 --> 00:57:54.871
SAID A LOT OF LESSONS LEARNED.

00:57:54.938 --> 00:57:56.239
STARTING WITH THE YOUR PLANS. I

00:57:56.306 --> 00:57:58.341
THINK NEED TO. THIS

00:57:58.408 --> 00:57:59.042
HANDICAPPING THE MUST THE

00:57:59.108 --> 00:58:05.415
PROGRAMS. TO GO ON DEVELOP. ON.

00:58:05.481 --> 00:58:08.218
THEIR I AND SO THAT'S SOMETHING.

00:58:08.284 --> 00:58:09.819
SO WANTED TO ME THAT. I WANT TO

00:58:09.886 --> 00:58:11.421
ALSO LOOK. THAT THE DEPARTMENT

00:58:11.487 --> 00:58:13.022
OF TOXIC. SPECIFICALLY TOSCA

00:58:13.089 --> 00:58:14.624
AND THE TOUGH GUY COUNT THAT WE

00:58:14.691 --> 00:58:16.459
HAVE. LAST WHEN WE DISCUSSED

00:58:16.526 --> 00:58:17.493
THIS ITEM HERE IN THE

00:58:17.560 --> 00:58:19.596
COMMITTEE. WE PROTECT THE TOSCA

00:58:19.662 --> 00:58:21.431
TO POTENTIALLY BE INSOLVENT IN

00:58:21.497 --> 00:58:23.066
THREE YEARS. ON AND WHEN WE'RE

00:58:23.132 --> 00:58:24.500
LOOKING AT THE BUDGET RIGHT NOW

00:58:24.567 --> 00:58:25.335
IN THE MONIES THAT ARE HERE

00:58:25.401 --> 00:58:27.170
RIGHT NOW LOOKING. AND THE

00:58:27.237 --> 00:58:30.206
BALANCE OF. SEVEN HUNDRED AND

00:58:30.273 --> 00:58:31.841
FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS- WHICH

00:58:31.908 --> 00:58:32.575
MEANS THAT WE HAVEREALLY NO

00:58:32.642 --> 00:58:34.310
SPACE FOR ANYTHING TO CHANGE

00:58:34.377 --> 00:58:34.811
AND EVERYWHERE ANY VERY

00:58:34.878 --> 00:58:37.080
ABILITY. ANA IN THERE AND SO

00:58:37.146 --> 00:58:38.715
LOOKS EVER BECOME INSOLVENT

00:58:38.781 --> 00:58:40.683
MUCH QUICKER. THAN WE HAD.

00:58:40.750 --> 00:58:42.785
ANTICIPATED AND OUR ESTIMATES

00:58:42.852 --> 00:58:44.487
CHANGE I UNDERSTAND THAT-

00:58:44.554 --> 00:58:45.955
WE'VE- DONE WE THEN HAVE A

00:58:46.022 --> 00:58:47.891
PROPOSAL OF GENERAL FUND MONIES

00:58:47.957 --> 00:58:49.459
THAT ARE MOVED. INTO ONE SPOT

00:58:49.525 --> 00:58:51.194
AND THEN SEE TO MOVE TO ANOTHER

00:58:51.261 --> 00:58:52.929
SPOT. INTO THIS IS TO BE THE

00:58:52.996 --> 00:58:54.664
SHUFFLE. OF MONEY THAT KIND OF

00:58:54.731 --> 00:58:56.099
HE'S TOO HIGH TO OUR PROBLEMS

00:58:56.165 --> 00:58:57.367
WHICH IS ONE OF THE CRITICISMS

00:58:57.433 --> 00:58:59.002
WE HAD LASTYEAR. AND SO THIS

00:58:59.068 --> 00:59:00.336
IS NOT A SHUFFLING OF DOLLARS

00:59:00.403 --> 00:59:01.571
AND THERE'S A RUSSIAN OFFER

00:59:01.638 --> 00:59:02.906
THIS. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

00:59:02.972 --> 00:59:04.607
THAT THE ADMINISTRATION EXPLAIN

00:59:04.674 --> 00:59:05.842
TO US WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.

00:59:05.909 --> 00:59:06.843
WITH HIS ACCOUNT AND HOW WE'RE

00:59:06.910 --> 00:59:09.178
MOVING GENERAL FUND MONIES. IN

00:59:09.245 --> 00:59:10.914
THERE BECAUSE WHEN I JUST READ

00:59:10.980 --> 00:59:12.382
IT LOOKS LIKE WE'RE SHUFFLING.

00:59:12.448 --> 00:59:13.216
WHEN YOU'RE ABOUT TO HAD A

00:59:13.283 --> 00:59:14.384
PROBLEM AND WE HAD A DAY

00:59:14.450 --> 00:59:16.252
THROUGH. A BUDGETING SEEK TO

00:59:16.319 --> 00:59:17.987
THESE NUMBERS OF REALLY WHAT'S

00:59:18.054 --> 00:59:19.622
GOING ON WITH TASK AND HOW. THE

00:59:19.689 --> 00:59:21.491
CITY CHANGED LAST YEAR TO THIS

00:59:21.557 --> 00:59:22.025
YEAR BUT EVERY DOING WITH.

00:59:22.091 --> 00:59:24.160
ACTIONS YEAH SO IT IS AN AREA

00:59:24.227 --> 00:59:25.662
WILL DEFINITELY AT MINISTRATION

00:59:25.728 --> 00:59:27.096
RECOGNIZE TO THE BUDGET. THAT'S

00:59:27.163 --> 00:59:29.065
NEAT ABSTRACT TENSION AND INTO

00:59:29.132 --> 00:59:30.867
SPECIFIC AREAS ONE. IS WITH

00:59:30.934 --> 00:59:32.502
REGARD TO THE FEE STRUCTURE AND

00:59:32.568 --> 00:59:33.937
THEN SECOND WITH REGARD TO

00:59:34.003 --> 00:59:35.204
GOVERNANCE REFORMS ARE TO RESET

00:59:35.271 --> 00:59:36.839
CAN SPEAK ABOUT BOTH OF THOSE

00:59:36.906 --> 00:59:39.075
AREAS. RIGHT SO THE DEPARTMENT

00:59:39.142 --> 00:59:40.610
TOXIC SUBSTANCE CONTROL IS AN

00:59:40.677 --> 00:59:44.047
GOING TO HAVE A- BIGGER- MORE

00:59:44.113 --> 00:59:45.748
DETAILED PACKAGE COME FEBRUARY

00:59:45.815 --> 00:59:46.916
FIRST ALONG WITH TRAILER BILL

00:59:46.983 --> 00:59:48.084
AND MORE DETAIL BEHIND THE

00:59:48.151 --> 00:59:49.552
PROPOSAL. YOU ARE CORRECT THAT

00:59:49.619 --> 00:59:52.121
THE TOSCA FIND IT DID REQUIRE A

00:59:52.188 --> 00:59:52.722
TWELVE MILLION DOLLAR GENERAL

00:59:52.789 --> 00:59:54.557
FUND BACK FILL IN TWENTY TWENTY

00:59:54.624 --> 00:59:55.558
ONE WHICH IS PROPOSED. BUT WE

00:59:55.625 --> 00:59:58.094
ARE HAPPY TO. SIT DOWN AND GO

00:59:58.161 --> 00:59:59.262
THROUGH WITH A BUDGET COMMITTEE

00:59:59.329 --> 01:00:05.201
STAFF IN MORE DETAIL KIND OF.

01:00:05.268 --> 01:00:05.702
TO THE FUN CONDITION TO

01:00:05.768 --> 01:00:07.503
EXPLAINS ANY OF THE I CHANGES.

01:00:07.570 --> 01:00:08.037
BUT THERE'S NO INTENT TO

01:00:08.104 --> 01:00:08.638
SHUFFLE DOLLARS AROUND BY WE

01:00:08.705 --> 01:00:10.139
KNOW. WITH UPDATED ESTA. I AM

01:00:10.206 --> 01:00:12.175
THE FALL THAT TOSCO WAS. MEDIAN

01:00:12.241 --> 01:00:13.042
AGE FUND FILLED KIND OF KEEP.

01:00:13.109 --> 01:00:14.711
IS ABOUT TWELVE MILLION

01:00:14.777 --> 01:00:16.479
DOLLARS. AND HOW IS IT THAT WE

01:00:16.546 --> 01:00:17.714
HAVE THAT DISCREPANCY IN LAST

01:00:17.780 --> 01:00:19.315
YEAR'S ANALYSIS WITH THAT THAT

01:00:19.382 --> 01:00:20.550
WE THOUGHT WE HAD THREE YEARS.

01:00:20.616 --> 01:00:22.385
BEFORE WE GOT TO THIS POINT.

01:00:22.452 --> 01:00:24.320
BUT THEN IN THIS. CURRENT

01:00:24.387 --> 01:00:24.887
BUDGET IF YOU'RE TELLING US

01:00:24.954 --> 01:00:26.389
THAT WE GOT TO THIS POINT.

01:00:26.456 --> 01:00:28.024
RIGHT HERE REQUESTED AND SO

01:00:28.091 --> 01:00:29.359
WHAT THE DISCREPANCY THERE HOW

01:00:29.425 --> 01:00:31.694
DID WE MISS ESTIMATES ABOUT. SO

01:00:31.761 --> 01:00:32.729
THEY COULD BE I AM DIFFERENCES

01:00:32.795 --> 01:00:34.764
IN. ANTICIPATED EXPENDITURE

01:00:34.831 --> 01:00:35.898
LEVELS THAT CAME IN FROM THE

01:00:35.965 --> 01:00:37.500
PRIOR YEAR ALSO ANTICIPATED

01:00:37.567 --> 01:00:39.669
REVENUES- AND SHE'S NOT

01:00:39.736 --> 01:00:41.237
MATERIALIZING AS IS PLUS ANY

01:00:41.304 --> 01:00:42.805
INCREASED COSTS THAT WEREN'T

01:00:42.872 --> 01:00:45.174
PART OF THAT ORIGINAL ESTIMATE-

01:00:45.241 --> 01:00:46.709
I DON'T RECALL THE THREE YEAR

01:00:46.776 --> 01:00:48.378
TIME FRAME I KNOW IN OUR BUDGET

01:00:48.444 --> 01:00:49.345
SUMMARY PAGES IN THE MAYOR OF

01:00:49.412 --> 01:00:50.613
IT. LAST YEAR I BELIEVE WE

01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:51.781
REFER TO KIND OF THE BOTH OF

01:00:51.848 --> 01:00:53.383
THE FUNDS BEING BOOKED OUT

01:00:53.449 --> 01:00:55.385
MORE- AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH

01:00:55.451 --> 01:00:57.286
TOSCA. ART SIX REFORM EFFORTS

01:00:57.353 --> 01:00:59.989
SO AGAIN WE CAN. TRY TO GO TO

01:01:00.056 --> 01:01:00.556
THE FUND CONDITION IN MORE

01:01:00.623 --> 01:01:04.160
DETAIL WITH BUDGET SOUTH THAT'S

01:01:04.227 --> 01:01:05.395
SOMETHING THAT WE CAN HELP WITH.

01:01:05.461 --> 01:01:07.563
THAT WE NEED MORE. I GUESS BUT-

01:01:07.630 --> 01:01:09.265
LAST WE HAD AT THIS WITH THE

01:01:09.332 --> 01:01:10.767
SAME DISCUSSION EARLY ON IN A

01:01:10.833 --> 01:01:13.002
CONTINUED AND I THINK IF I GO

01:01:13.069 --> 01:01:14.170
BACK TO THE GOVERNOR'S SCHOOL

01:01:14.237 --> 01:01:15.772
OF JUSTICE FOR ALL THIS IS

01:01:15.838 --> 01:01:16.973
ANOTHER PART OF THAT PIECE

01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:17.774
THERE OVERLOOKING AN

01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:18.708
ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ISSUES

01:01:18.775 --> 01:01:20.209
OVER LOOK AT TAXES WERE LOOKING

01:01:20.276 --> 01:01:21.210
AT THE SAME COMMUNITIES ARE

01:01:21.277 --> 01:01:22.979
REALLY IN ONE ISSUE AFTER

01:01:23.046 --> 01:01:26.315
ANOTHER. OUT THERE- WE WANT TO

01:01:26.382 --> 01:01:27.984
ASK A TO BE HEALTHY WE WANT IT

01:01:28.051 --> 01:01:28.918
TO WORK WE WANT TO MAKE SURE

01:01:28.985 --> 01:01:30.853
THAT WE HAVE MONEY TO THE SITE

01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:32.522
WE MEDIATION OFFER BROWNFIELDS

01:01:32.588 --> 01:01:34.557
AND SUPER FUNDS AND DO OUR PART

01:01:34.624 --> 01:01:35.324
SIDE WITH THE BUT THE FEDERAL

01:01:35.391 --> 01:01:37.326
GOVERNMENT'S DOING WE ONE KELLY

01:01:37.393 --> 01:01:40.296
P. TO BE NEEDING IT'S YOU KNOW.

01:01:40.363 --> 01:01:42.331
IT'S GOAL AT OF HEALTHY

01:01:42.398 --> 01:01:43.266
COMMUNITIES AT THE WE FORGET

01:01:43.332 --> 01:01:44.700
THAT OFTENTIMES TIED INTO THIS

01:01:44.767 --> 01:01:46.669
AN IMPORTANT PIECE OF THAT AND

01:01:46.736 --> 01:01:48.304
IN MY DISCUSSIONS WITH THE

01:01:48.371 --> 01:01:49.172
DEPARTMENT WHAT THE

01:01:49.238 --> 01:01:51.074
ADMINISTRATION- IT SEEM LIKE

01:01:51.140 --> 01:01:52.508
WITH. WHAT YOU'RE TELLING ME

01:01:52.575 --> 01:01:53.743
THEY ANYTHING TO ME WAS THAT

01:01:53.810 --> 01:01:54.911
THEY HAD A THING TO ME LAST

01:01:54.977 --> 01:01:55.912
YEAR WITH THINGS THAT HAVE

01:01:55.978 --> 01:01:57.747
CHANGED ON AND SUCH AS AS WE'RE

01:01:57.814 --> 01:01:59.115
MOVING FORWARD AND WE'RE

01:01:59.182 --> 01:02:01.884
TALKING ABOUT HOW TO STABILIZE.

01:02:01.951 --> 01:02:03.586
THE TOSCOACCOUNT LONG TERM HOW

01:02:03.653 --> 01:02:05.688
TO MAKE SURE THAT MONIES ARE

01:02:05.755 --> 01:02:08.257
BEING RESPECTED WITHIN THE PROP

01:02:08.324 --> 01:02:08.691
TWENTY SIX SPECTRUM

01:02:08.758 --> 01:02:09.826
INTERNATIONALLY THINGS AROUND

01:02:09.892 --> 01:02:11.127
THAT THATALSO THAT I ASK

01:02:11.194 --> 01:02:13.129
MYSELF THE QUESTION IS THIS.

01:02:13.196 --> 01:02:14.664
TWELVE MILLION AS WE MOVE TO

01:02:14.730 --> 01:02:15.665
ONE SPOT IN THAT ELEVENTH AND

01:02:15.731 --> 01:02:17.366
THEY'RE MOVING DIRECTLY AGAIN

01:02:17.433 --> 01:02:18.434
THE WAY TO GET AROUND SOME OF

01:02:18.501 --> 01:02:20.570
THAT MISSION- THERE AND SO I

01:02:20.636 --> 01:02:21.871
THINK THAT THERE'S A LITTLE BIT

01:02:21.938 --> 01:02:25.208
OF DISTRUST FROM MYSELF AND

01:02:25.274 --> 01:02:27.243

SPACE. ON THE THIRD ITEM TAKE

01:02:34.484 --> 01:02:35.718
TO THIS AND THIS. IN THE SAME

01:02:35.785 --> 01:02:37.120

01:06:18.641 --> 01:06:20.209
OF THE TWO THIRDS ISSUES WITHIN

BUDGET- THIS APARTMENT DIRECTED

01:08:08.317 --> 01:08:09.885
PART OF FINANCE HERE THERE'S

01:08:09.952 --> 01:08:11.754
SOME PRETTY BOLD PROPOSALS-

01:08:11.821 --> 01:08:12.888
WITH REGARD TO HEALTH CARE

01:08:12.955 --> 01:08:13.722
WHICH IS REALLY EXCITING TO ME

01:08:13.789 --> 01:08:15.658
AS A AS A PROVIDER AND THE

01:08:15.724 --> 01:08:18.160
CHAIR OF THE HEALTH COMMITTEE-

01:08:18.227 --> 01:08:20.396
BUT THERE'S ALSO SOME THERE

01:08:20.463 --> 01:08:21.197
THERE'S PRETTY WELL PRETTY

01:08:21.263 --> 01:08:24.834
LIGHT ON DETAILS- AND SO I AM

01:08:24.900 --> 01:08:26.502
CURIOUS AS TO WHEN WE WILL SEE

01:08:26.569 --> 01:08:27.369
THAT WE KEEP HEARING OF

01:08:27.436 --> 01:08:31.907
FEBRUARY FIRST DAY. BUT BUT

01:08:31.974 --> 01:08:33.108
I'VE ALSO HEARD OTHER DATES SO.

01:08:33.175 --> 01:08:34.243
AS IT RELATES TO THE BUDGET

01:08:34.310 --> 01:08:36.579
AND- WHEN WE GOING TO GET MORE

01:08:36.645 --> 01:08:40.049
INFORMATION ON SAY FOR EXAMPLE-

01:08:40.115 --> 01:08:42.117
THE PRESCRIPTION AND THE-

01:08:42.184 --> 01:08:43.252
MANUFACTURING FOR PRESCRIPTION

01:08:43.319 --> 01:08:46.689
DRUGS- OFFICE OF HEALTH CARE-

01:08:46.755 --> 01:08:49.658
AFFORDABILITY- WHEN WE GET SOME

01:08:49.725 --> 01:08:51.126
MORE DETAILS AT THIS POINT ON

01:08:51.193 --> 01:08:53.796
THOSE ISSUES. SO AS OU

01:08:53.863 --> 01:08:55.097
MENTIONED THERE ARE A NUMBER OF

01:08:55.164 --> 01:08:56.232
DIFFERENT PROPOSALS THAT ARE

01:08:56.298 --> 01:08:57.299
NEW THIS YEARIN THE HEALTH

01:08:57.366 --> 01:08:59.301
CARE SPACE AND I'D KIND IS A

01:08:59.368 --> 01:09:00.469
MIGHTY ONE WOULD LOOK AT IS TO

01:09:00.536 --> 01:09:02.238
SEPARATE THEM INTO A- COUPLE OF

01:09:02.304 --> 01:09:03.506
DIFFERENT CATEGORIES SO I THINK

01:09:03.572 --> 01:09:05.307
THERE'S SOME WAY OR IT'S VERY

01:09:05.374 --> 01:09:06.809
CLEAR WHAT IT WILL LOOK LIKE

01:09:06.876 --> 01:09:08.811
AND- HOW WILL OPERATE EVEN IF

01:09:08.878 --> 01:09:10.179
IT IS A BIG TICKET ITEM AND SO

01:09:10.246 --> 01:09:11.180
AN EXAMPLE THIS IS THE

01:09:11.247 --> 01:09:12.848
EXPANSION OF MEDICARE HOW. TO

01:09:12.915 --> 01:09:15.284
THE UNDOCUMENTED POPULATION AGE

01:09:15.351 --> 01:09:16.218
SIXTY FIVE IN ABOUT THE

01:09:16.285 --> 01:09:18.053
INCLUDING AYE HSS- PREVIOUS

01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:20.523
BUDGETS HAD DONE THAT UP TO AGE

01:09:20.589 --> 01:09:21.790
NINETEEN IN THE BUDGET ENACTED

01:09:21.857 --> 01:09:24.493
LAST YEAR TO TAKE TWENTY SIX

01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:25.761
SALT THE DIFFERENT POPULATION

01:09:25.828 --> 01:09:27.096
WITH DIFFERENT NEEDS WE HAVE A

01:09:27.162 --> 01:09:28.731
SENSE OF HOW THAT WILL ROLL OUT

01:09:28.797 --> 01:09:29.532
OVER TIME AND WHAT THE DETAILS

01:09:29.598 --> 01:09:32.067
WILL BE- SO THE SECOND CATEGORY

01:09:32.134 --> 01:09:33.602
OF EXPENSES ARE SOMEWHERE WE

01:09:33.669 --> 01:09:35.337
STILL HAVE A LOT TO WORK OUT.

01:09:35.404 --> 01:09:36.939
THANKS THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF

01:09:37.006 --> 01:09:38.040
THAT IN TERMS OF GENERAL

01:09:38.107 --> 01:09:40.876
CONCEPT PAPERS- AND THINKING-

01:09:40.943 --> 01:09:42.378
ALREADY JOHN AND SHARED WITH

01:09:42.444 --> 01:09:43.245
THE LEGISLATURE I THINK AN

01:09:43.312 --> 01:09:44.880
EXAMPLE DAY SO WE THOUGHT

01:09:44.947 --> 01:09:46.282
BROADER LEVEL IS TO HELP YOUR

01:09:46.348 --> 01:09:48.984
CALIFORNIA FOR ALL AS CALENDARS

01:09:49.051 --> 01:09:50.286
DOCTOR AND GO ON AND SHE DID A

01:09:50.352 --> 01:09:51.887
DANCE IN IT. CAL AND SO THIS

01:09:51.954 --> 01:09:55.991
IS- ALL HHS AGENCIES WEBSITE-

01:09:56.058 --> 01:09:57.393
THEIR DOCUMENTS IN TERMS OF HOW

01:09:57.459 --> 01:09:58.494
THEY IN THE ADMINISTRATION OR

01:09:58.561 --> 01:10:00.129
SOMETHING ABOUT IT WHAT THE

01:10:00.195 --> 01:10:01.530
APPROACH IS WHY WE THINK IT'S

01:10:01.597 --> 01:10:05.167
FRIENDS THAT WE- HAVE TO FILL

01:10:05.234 --> 01:10:07.703
IN A LOT OF THE DETAILS I THINK

01:10:07.770 --> 01:10:08.370
YOU CAN LOOK AT THOSE DOCUMENTS.

01:10:08.437 --> 01:10:10.739
WHICH ARE EX. AND DISCUSS THE

01:10:10.806 --> 01:10:11.907
AGES AND SEE WHERE IT'S- THE

01:10:11.974 --> 01:10:13.576
FINAL CATEGORY WHICH I WAS THE

01:10:13.642 --> 01:10:15.511
TOUGHEST AYE AREN'T

01:10:15.578 --> 01:10:15.945
SPECIFICALLY IN THE

01:10:16.011 --> 01:10:17.413
PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICING AND

01:10:17.479 --> 01:10:22.851

01:10:22.918 --> 01:10:26.989
DETAILS ON FEB FIRST BUT FOR A

01:10:27.056 --> 01:10:29.525
LOT OF THESE MISSILES. A REAL

01:10:29.592 --> 01:10:32.027
BEEF NEW CONCEPT NO ONE ZERO

01:10:32.094 --> 01:10:33.395
SEE SOME OF THOSE PROPOSALS

01:10:33.462 --> 01:10:34.863
WILL NOT FULLY BE FLESHED OUT

01:10:34.930 --> 01:10:36.999
UNTIL THE SPRING I VERY

01:10:37.066 --> 01:10:38.434
CONSCIOUS OF YOUR POINT IN THE

01:10:38.500 --> 01:10:40.369
CHERRY POINT THAT MORE WE PUSH

THE CLIMATE BOND THERE'S ABOUT

01:13:20.562 --> 01:13:21.029
THREE HUNDRED NINETY FIVE

01:13:21.096 --> 01:13:22.030

FORTY MILLION GOING TO THE BARN

01:13:27.836 --> 01:13:30.139

CRACKS TO THE CRITICALLY OVER

01:13:33.475 --> 01:13:34.710
GRAFTED BASINS THAT HELP THE

01:13:34.777 --> 01:13:37.713
POOR PLANNING. RELATED TO THE-

01:13:37.780 --> 01:13:40.048
ECONOMIC MEDICATION ISSUES AND

01:13:40.115 --> 01:13:40.883

WITH- WATER ENERGY EFFICIENCY

01:13:46.722 --> 01:13:48.257
SO WHERE ON THAT'S FANTASTIC

01:13:48.323 --> 01:13:50.159
BUT- CAN YOU TELL ME THE NUMBER

01:13:50.225 --> 01:13:55.164
THAT. IS AND HOW MUCH IS GOING

01:13:55.230 --> 01:13:56.965
TO. FIX THE OUTDATED CONVEYANCE

01:13:57.032 --> 01:13:58.066
SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE IN STATIC.

01:13:58.133 --> 01:13:59.768
AND TO STOP THE WATER LOSSES

01:13:59.835 --> 01:14:00.936
THAT WE HAVE THERE. BECAUSE IF

THOSE OTHER PROGRAMS ARE REALLY

01:14:03.639 --> 01:14:05.941
GOING TO BE AFFECTED. SO I

01:14:06.008 --> 01:14:06.775
DON'T THINK I'LL KNOW IT JUST

01:14:06.842 --> 01:14:08.510
GOING BACK TO THE CLIMATE BOND.

01:14:08.577 --> 01:14:09.945

DOLLARS THERE'S MULTIPLE TYPE

01:14:16.285 --> 01:14:16.919
THE PROJECT THAT COULD BE

01:14:16.985 --> 01:14:19.087
ELIGIBLE ONE OF THE PROJECT IS

01:14:19.154 --> 01:14:21.023
WATER CONVEYANCE. THAT'S ONE OF

01:14:21.089 --> 01:14:21.824
THE DIFFERENT GOOD POINT THAT

01:14:21.890 --> 01:14:23.859
MAY BE ELIGIBLE WITHIN THE ONE

01:14:23.926 --> 01:14:25.260
BILLION DOLLAR ALLOCATION AND

01:14:25.327 --> 01:14:26.562
THE KIND OF THAT'S NOT GOING TO

01:14:26.628 --> 01:14:28.497
HELP. WITH REAL CROPPERS

01:14:28.564 --> 01:14:32.334
DECIDING ON WHETHER OR NOT CARE

01:14:32.401 --> 01:14:32.901

01:17:53.001 --> 01:17:54.703
GOVERNOR FINALLY PROPOSED TO

01:17:54.770 --> 01:17:56.204
DEPOSIT THIS MONEY WITH A

01:17:56.271 --> 01:17:58.407
COUPLE OF CATCHES AND THEN ONE

01:17:58.473 --> 01:18:00.942
BEING THAT ONLY THE- REVENUE

01:18:01.009 --> 01:18:04.179
GENERATED- WOULD BE USED TO FOR

01:18:04.246 --> 01:18:07.649
THAT FOR THE HOMEOWNERS. I AM

01:18:07.716 --> 01:18:09.117
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND IF YOU

01:18:09.184 --> 01:18:10.886
COULD ADD SOME INSIGHT AS TO

01:18:10.952 --> 01:18:15.023
WHEN THE- PLAINTIFFS IN THIS

01:18:15.090 --> 01:18:15.957
CASE BECAUSE IT DID HAVE TO GO

01:18:16.024 --> 01:18:18.760
TO COURT MAN AS YOU RECALL THIS

01:18:18.827 --> 01:18:20.595
WE WERE ORDERED TO DEPOSIT THAT

01:18:20.662 --> 01:18:23.265
MONEY APPROPRIATELY- HOW LONG

01:18:23.331 --> 01:18:24.800
IS IT THAT THE PLAINTIFFS WILL

01:18:24.866 --> 01:18:26.868
HAVE TO WAIT IN ORDER TO SEE

01:18:26.935 --> 01:18:28.637
ALL OF THAT MONEY NOT JUST HAVE

01:18:28.703 --> 01:18:29.438
A TRICKLE UP AT ALL OF THAT

01:18:29.504 --> 01:18:31.907
MONEY. GO TO THOSE FOR WHOM IT

01:18:31.973 --> 01:18:34.142
WAS INTENDED- COM IT DIDN'T

01:18:34.209 --> 01:18:35.744
HAPPEN LAST YEAR I'M CURIOUS AS

01:18:35.811 --> 01:18:36.878
TO WHY IT DOESN'T APPEAR IT'S

01:18:36.945 --> 01:18:39.147
HAPPENING THIS YEAR AND WE SEEM

01:18:39.214 --> 01:18:40.916
TO BE SLOW ROLLING THIS AND I

01:18:40.982 --> 01:18:41.883
JUST WONDER IF YOU COULD

01:18:41.950 --> 01:18:43.085
PROVIDE SOME INSIGHT ON THAT

01:18:43.151 --> 01:18:45.720
USHER HAPPY TO- DISCUSS BRIEFLY

01:18:45.787 --> 01:18:47.355
SO I THINK THE FIRST POINT IS

01:18:47.422 --> 01:18:49.291
THAT YOU ARE CORRECT- THERE WAS

01:18:49.357 --> 01:18:51.359
A JUDGMENT. THAT THE PLAINTIFFS

01:18:51.426 --> 01:18:52.727
WINE AND SO AFTER THAT

01:18:52.794 --> 01:18:54.429
JUDGMENT- I BELIEVE THE FIGURE

01:18:54.496 --> 01:18:55.997
WAS THREE HUNDRED THIRTY ONE

01:18:56.064 --> 01:18:57.666
MILLION DOLLARS AND THAT WAS-

01:18:57.732 --> 01:18:59.601
IS TRANSFERRED- I'LL GET YOU

01:18:59.668 --> 01:19:00.635
TRANSFERRED OUT OF OUR SPECIAL

01:19:00.702 --> 01:19:02.170
FUND FOR ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTIES

01:19:02.237 --> 01:19:03.371
OR RESERVE DROPPED BY THAT

01:19:03.438 --> 01:19:06.241
LEVEL- BECAUSE- IT IS FOR THE

01:19:06.308 --> 01:19:07.109
SPECIFIC PURPOSES THAT YOU

01:19:07.175 --> 01:19:09.778
MENTIONED. SO DE JUDGMENT

01:19:09.845 --> 01:19:10.846
BASICALLY SAID THAT UNDER THAT

01:19:10.912 --> 01:19:12.414
SETTLEMENT OF THE MONEY COULD

01:19:12.481 --> 01:19:13.849
ONLY BE USED FOR SPECIFIED

01:19:13.915 --> 01:19:16.485
PURPOSES- SO THEY'RE BASICALLY-

01:19:16.551 --> 01:19:17.619
TWO QUESTIONS THAT THE

01:19:17.686 --> 01:19:18.854
ADMINISTRATION AND THIS IS ON

01:19:18.920 --> 01:19:20.722
GOING WITH THE LEGISLATURE HAVE

01:19:20.789 --> 01:19:22.357
TO THINK ABOUT THE FIRST IS

01:19:22.424 --> 01:19:23.792
WHETHER WE WANT TO SPEND THIS

01:19:23.859 --> 01:19:25.060
ON A ONE TIME BASIS YOU TO

01:19:25.127 --> 01:19:26.761
SPEND IT ALL IN A YEAR OR TWO

01:19:26.828 --> 01:19:28.830
YEARS OR ESTABLISH A FINE TO

01:19:28.897 --> 01:19:30.432
WEAR IN ANY GIVEN YEAR THE

01:19:30.499 --> 01:19:31.266
LEVEL SPENDING WILL BE MUCH

01:19:31.333 --> 01:19:32.934
GLASS. BUT THEN THAT MONEY WILL

01:19:33.001 --> 01:19:34.436
ALWAYS BE THERE YOU KNOW

01:19:34.503 --> 01:19:35.036
WHETHER THE ECONOMY IS DOING

01:19:35.103 --> 01:19:36.905
WELL WHETHER IT'S A RECESSION

01:19:36.972 --> 01:19:38.073
LIKE THE ONE THAT LED TO THE

01:19:38.140 --> 01:19:38.874
FORECLOSURE CRISIS IN THE FIRST

01:19:38.940 --> 01:19:40.342
PLACE TO THE ADMINISTRATION'S

01:19:40.408 --> 01:19:41.109
APPROACH IS THE SECOND

01:19:41.176 --> 01:19:42.744
APPROACH- BUT WE UNDERSTAND

01:19:42.811 --> 01:19:44.179
THAT THERE MAY BE DIFFERING.

01:19:44.246 --> 01:19:45.814
OPINIONS IN TERMS OF HOW

01:19:45.881 --> 01:19:47.482
SPECIFICALLY TO SPEND- IN TERMS

01:19:47.549 --> 01:19:48.383
OF THE AMOUNT OF MONEY IN A

01:19:48.450 --> 01:19:50.285
GIVEN YEAR OR HOW TO SET UP

01:19:50.352 --> 01:19:52.187
DESTRUCTION FOR SPENDING IT AND

01:19:52.254 --> 01:19:53.188
THEN THE SECOND QUESTION IS

01:19:53.255 --> 01:19:54.789
WHAT DO YOU SPEND IT ON AND SO

01:19:54.856 --> 01:19:55.891
OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE

01:19:55.957 --> 01:19:57.893
JUDGMENT IS THAT IT THE MONEY

01:19:57.959 --> 01:19:59.694
DOESN'T. IT'S DOESN'T GO

01:19:59.761 --> 01:20:00.795
SPECIFICALLY TO THE PLAINTIFFS

01:20:00.862 --> 01:20:02.497
IT GOES FOR THE PURPOSE STAYS

01:20:02.564 --> 01:20:03.365
IN THE SETTLEMENT WHICH OF

01:20:03.431 --> 01:20:05.267
COURSE THE PLAINTIFFS SUPPORT

01:20:05.333 --> 01:20:08.570
THAT'S WHY THEY BROUGHT THE

01:20:08.637 --> 01:20:10.772
SUIT AND IN PARTICULAR THEY

01:20:10.839 --> 01:20:12.040
WERE TO THE AND- FOR. WORK WITH

01:20:12.107 --> 01:20:13.575
THE SETTLEMENT. AND THAT WE FOR

01:20:13.642 --> 01:20:14.809
APPEAL. A THE END. WHICH IS

01:20:14.876 --> 01:20:18.246
NUMBER RENTER- AND PROTECTIONS-

01:20:18.313 --> 01:20:19.447
FOR RENDERING HOMEOWNERS WHO

01:20:19.514 --> 01:20:21.283
WORKS.IN FORECLOSURE AT RISK

01:20:21.349 --> 01:20:22.784
OF FORECLOSURE OFTEN THEY DON'T

01:20:22.851 --> 01:20:23.818
HAVE THE LEGAL ASSISTANCE THEY

01:20:23.885 --> 01:20:25.453
NEED. IN THESE VERY COMPLICATED

01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:26.855
PROCEEDINGS AND WE SAW THAT

01:20:26.922 --> 01:20:28.390
DURING THE FINANCIAL CRISIS. SO

01:20:28.456 --> 01:20:31.560
THIS MONEY COULD HELP AND I GET

01:20:31.626 --> 01:20:32.961
SECOND IS THE BROADER CATEGORY

01:20:33.028 --> 01:20:34.029
OF BORROWER FOR WEEKS AND

01:20:34.095 --> 01:20:35.564
THAT'S A SENT OUT PHRASE THAT

01:20:35.630 --> 01:20:37.132
YOU WOULD SEE IN THE ORIGINAL.

01:20:37.199 --> 01:20:37.699
SETTLEMENT IN TERMS OF THE

01:20:37.766 --> 01:20:39.434
JUDGE'S INSTRUCTIONS- AND THEN

01:20:39.501 --> 01:20:40.669
THE FINAL POINT YOU RACES THE

01:20:40.735 --> 01:20:43.038
TIME LINE SO LAST FALL- WERE

01:20:43.104 --> 01:20:44.906
THE INITIAL. DISCUSSIONS ABOUT

01:20:44.973 --> 01:20:46.041
THIS WITH THE LEGISLATURE WHEN

01:20:46.107 --> 01:20:47.075
THE GOVERNOR ROLLED OUT HIS

01:20:47.142 --> 01:20:49.010
CONCEPT FOR IT- YOU ARE CORRECT

01:20:49.077 --> 01:20:51.012
THAT OUT IT'S ONLY A COUPLE

01:20:51.079 --> 01:20:52.214
SENTENCES IN OUR EIGHT PAGES IN

01:20:52.280 --> 01:20:53.848
THIS BUDGET- WE DO HAVE

01:20:53.915 --> 01:20:55.016
ADDITIONAL WORK TO DO TO

01:20:55.083 --> 01:20:56.585
ACTUALLY FLUSH OUT THAT CONCEPT

01:20:56.651 --> 01:20:57.953
TO US SO THAT WE CAN SET UP A

01:20:58.019 --> 01:20:59.321
TRUST. IF THE LEGISLATURE

01:20:59.387 --> 01:21:00.789
APPROVES OF THAT STRUCTURE. AND

01:21:00.855 --> 01:21:01.690
THEN GET THE MONEY FLOWING

01:21:01.756 --> 01:21:03.058
AFTER THAT- BUT THAT'S

01:21:03.124 --> 01:21:04.125
SOMETHING IN THE NEXT COUPLE

01:21:04.192 --> 01:21:07.629
WEEKS MONTHS. WE WANT TO WORK

01:21:07.696 --> 01:21:10.165
WITH WHAT THE LEGISLATURE. OKAY

01:21:10.232 --> 01:21:12.701
THANK YOU MISTRESS THANK YOU

01:21:12.767 --> 01:21:17.205
MISTER. OF MY COLLEAGUE

01:21:17.272 --> 01:21:19.507
ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA ASKED A

01:21:19.574 --> 01:21:21.743
FEW QUESTIONS ABOUT THE AB SIX

01:21:21.810 --> 01:21:23.645
SEVENTEEN COMMITTEE- PROTECTION

01:21:23.712 --> 01:21:26.448
PROGRAM I TOO AM VERY CONCERNED

01:21:26.514 --> 01:21:29.684
ABOUT THE REDUCTION FROM THE

01:21:29.751 --> 01:21:30.252
FIFTY MILLION TO TWENTY FIVE

01:21:30.318 --> 01:21:33.488
MILLION. SHE SO CORRECTLY

01:21:33.555 --> 01:21:34.923
STATED IT'S OUR MOST

01:21:34.990 --> 01:21:37.892
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THAT

01:21:37.959 --> 01:21:39.694
WERE BEING ASSISTED THROUGH

01:21:39.761 --> 01:21:41.763
THIS PROGRAM THE INITIAL PART

01:21:41.830 --> 01:21:44.065
OF IT WAS THE VALUATION AND

01:21:44.132 --> 01:21:45.133
THEN THE FUNDING WAS GOING TO

01:21:45.200 --> 01:21:47.402
HELP TO IMPLEMENT THE VERY

01:21:47.469 --> 01:21:48.703
PROGRAMS THAT ALL THOSE

01:21:48.770 --> 01:21:50.572
COMMUNITY MEMBERS MAPPED TO

01:21:50.639 --> 01:21:52.907
DISCUSS THE CAME UP WITH A PLAN

01:21:52.974 --> 01:21:54.009
AND NOW THE PLAN WILL BE

01:21:54.075 --> 01:21:55.610
SHELVED BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE

01:21:55.677 --> 01:21:57.445
THE MONEY TO IMPLEMENT IT.

01:21:57.512 --> 01:21:59.514
THAT'S AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT

01:21:59.581 --> 01:22:01.616
AREA OF FOR ME WHEN WE'RE

01:22:01.683 --> 01:22:02.417
TALKING ABOUT CHANGING THE

01:22:02.484 --> 01:22:04.419
FUNDING INSTEAD OF IT GOING

01:22:04.486 --> 01:22:05.487
DOWN WE SHOULD HAVE TALKED

01:22:05.553 --> 01:22:07.622
ABOUT IT GOING UP BECAUSE WE

01:22:07.689 --> 01:22:10.225
FOUND FROM THE STUDIES AND

01:22:10.292 --> 01:22:11.960
FROM. ALL OF THE COMMUNITY.

01:22:12.027 --> 01:22:13.662
INPUT THAT THE NEED WAS EVEN

01:22:13.728 --> 01:22:14.763
GREATER THAN WHAT HAD BEEN

01:22:14.829 --> 01:22:18.266
ANTICIPATED. I AT WHEN WE WERE

01:22:18.333 --> 01:22:20.735
TAKING A VOTE SPECIFICALLY ON

01:22:20.802 --> 01:22:22.404
THE RIO THROUGH RE

01:22:22.470 --> 01:22:24.406
AUTHORIZATION OF CAP AND TRADE.

01:22:24.472 --> 01:22:26.341
ONE OF THE REASONS THAT I VOTED

01:22:26.408 --> 01:22:29.711
FOR IT IS BECAUSE AB SIX

01:22:29.778 --> 01:22:30.578
SEVENTEEN WAS PART OF THAT

01:22:30.645 --> 01:22:34.482
DISCUSSION. AND TO SEE THAT WE

01:22:34.549 --> 01:22:35.617
ARE GOING IN THE OPPOSITE

01:22:35.684 --> 01:22:37.852
DIRECTION IS OF GREAT CONCERN

01:22:37.919 --> 01:22:39.554
TO ME. THERE IS A SPECIFIC

01:22:39.621 --> 01:22:43.325
QUESTION ON THAT I JUST WANT TO.

01:22:43.391 --> 01:22:45.293
LINDA MY VOICE TO WHAT MY

01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:49.798
COLLEAGUE HAS STATED. ON THE

01:22:49.864 --> 01:22:52.100
EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT

01:22:52.167 --> 01:22:54.936
EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION. THE

01:22:55.003 --> 01:22:56.137
FOOD WE KNOW THAT THE

01:22:56.204 --> 01:22:58.573
GOVERNOR'S DEVOTION- TOO EARLY

01:22:58.640 --> 01:22:59.574
CHILDHOOD EDUCATION HAS BEEN

01:22:59.641 --> 01:23:03.745
CLEAR AND I DO APPRECIATE- HIS

01:23:03.812 --> 01:23:06.014
AND CREATING THE CENTRALIZED

01:23:06.081 --> 01:23:08.383
GOVERNING SPACE. FOR EARLY

01:23:08.450 --> 01:23:10.752
CHILDHOOD EDUCATION AND FOR ALL

01:23:10.819 --> 01:23:12.053
OF THOSE PROGRAMS I THAT'S

01:23:12.120 --> 01:23:14.255
REALLY APPRECIATED AND I- I'M

01:23:14.322 --> 01:23:15.890
HAPPY TO BE WORKING WITH THE

01:23:15.957 --> 01:23:17.726
GOVERNOR ON THE CREATION OF

01:23:17.792 --> 01:23:19.728
THIS PARTICULAR DEPARTMENT WITH

01:23:19.794 --> 01:23:22.097
THAT BEING SAID. I AM REALLY

01:23:22.163 --> 01:23:23.998
CONCERNED THAT THE BUDGET ONLY

01:23:24.065 --> 01:23:26.634
INCLUDES TEN MILLION DOLLARS

01:23:26.701 --> 01:23:31.106
FOR THIS- IS THE ADDITION OF

01:23:31.172 --> 01:23:33.475
CHILDHOOD SLOTS. WE ALL KNOW

01:23:33.541 --> 01:23:35.944
ARE SO IMPORTANT AND WITH ONLY

01:23:36.010 --> 01:23:36.378
TEN MILLION DOLLARS

01:23:36.444 --> 01:23:39.180
SPECIFICALLY FOR THAT. IT IS A

01:23:39.247 --> 01:23:41.616
SERVICE IF SERVICE PROBLEM- WE

01:23:41.683 --> 01:23:43.551
KNOW THAT THE OF THE INCREDIBLE

01:23:43.618 --> 01:23:45.787
NUMBER OF CHILDREN. WHO ARE

01:23:45.854 --> 01:23:46.921
ELIGIBLE FOR SUBSIDIZED

01:23:46.988 --> 01:23:48.890
CHILDCARE AND HAVE YET TO

01:23:48.957 --> 01:23:51.559
RECEIVE IT. AND WE'RE NOT

01:23:51.626 --> 01:23:53.361
INVESTING ENOUGH WE CAN'T

01:23:53.428 --> 01:23:56.398
FIGHT. TO GET RID OF TO RADIC

01:23:56.464 --> 01:23:58.600
KATE POVERTY IF WE'RE NOT

01:23:58.666 --> 01:24:00.135
TAKING CARE OF THE VERY

01:24:00.201 --> 01:24:07.342
pTHE MOST- IF THE CHILDREN ARE.

01:24:07.409 --> 01:24:09.778
CURRENTLY IN NEED OF SLOTS. IF

01:24:09.844 --> 01:24:11.179
THOSE WHO ARE MOST IN NEED OF

01:24:11.246 --> 01:24:13.114
SLOTS NOW ARE NOT GOING TO GET

01:24:13.181 --> 01:24:14.916
THEM THEY WERE FALLING FURTHER

01:24:14.983 --> 01:24:17.051
AND FURTHER BEHIND AND THIS

01:24:17.118 --> 01:24:19.521
FIGHT AGAINST POVERTY IS NOT

01:24:19.587 --> 01:24:20.121
GOING TO BE A FIGHT THAT WE

01:24:20.188 --> 01:24:23.091
WILL WIN. I DO WANT TO SHARE

01:24:23.158 --> 01:24:25.393
THIS CHAIR OF THE ASSEMBLY

01:24:25.460 --> 01:24:27.662
HUMAN SERVICES COMMITTEE IT IS

01:24:27.729 --> 01:24:29.130
MY PRIORITY THAT WE INSURE THAT

01:24:29.197 --> 01:24:32.300
OUR BUDGET PRIORITIZE IS NOT

01:24:32.367 --> 01:24:34.269
ONLY THE WHOLE PERSON CARE

01:24:34.335 --> 01:24:35.637
COVERING THE BEHAVIORAL THE

01:24:35.703 --> 01:24:37.105
DEVELOPMENTAL AND THE PHYSICAL

01:24:37.172 --> 01:24:40.842
NEEDS OF CALIFORNIANS BUT ALSO

01:24:40.909 --> 01:24:42.977
THE WHOLE FAMILY CARE. I THINK

01:24:43.044 --> 01:24:45.079
THAT'S PART OF WHAT'S MISSING I

PROCESS OF THAT. AND WE'VE MADE

01:25:58.786 --> 01:25:59.521
THIS COMMITMENT AND THESE ARE

01:25:59.587 --> 01:26:02.390
HARDEST HIT COMMUNITIES- AND I

01:26:02.457 --> 01:26:03.525
FEEL THIS IN MY COMMUNITY SO I

01:26:03.591 --> 01:26:04.192
JUST WANT TO ECHO THE

01:26:04.259 --> 01:26:05.493

YOU KNOW LAST YEAR WE FOUGHT

01:26:10.765 --> 01:26:11.633
VERY HARD TO GET MORE MONEY TO

01:26:11.699 --> 01:26:13.601
CALVET. THE CALIFORNIA VIOLENCE

01:26:13.668 --> 01:26:14.402
INTERVENTION PREVENTION

01:26:14.469 --> 01:26:16.471
PROGRAM- IT HAD BEEN NINE

01:26:16.538 --> 01:26:18.573
MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR- IT

01:26:18.640 --> 01:26:20.642
WENT UP TO THIRTY. BY WAY OF-

01:26:20.708 --> 01:26:22.076
COMPARISONS THIRTY NINE MILLION

01:26:22.143 --> 01:26:23.878
DOLLARS IN NEW YORK CITY ALONE

01:26:23.945 --> 01:26:24.679
FOR ONE CITY IN CALIFORNIA'S

01:26:24.746 --> 01:26:26.748
NOW AT THIRTY- WHICH IS NOT THE

01:26:26.814 --> 01:26:27.882
FULL BUDGET REQUESTS BUT IT WAS

01:26:27.949 --> 01:26:29.050
CERTAINLY AN IMPROVEMENT I SEE

01:26:29.117 --> 01:26:30.184
THE BUDGET NOW THIS YEAR'S BACK

01:26:30.251 --> 01:26:31.019
DOWN TO NINE MILLION OF

01:26:31.085 --> 01:26:32.754
REDUCTION. IN THESE PROGRAMS

01:26:32.820 --> 01:26:34.122
THAT WE KNOW WORK AND HELP

01:26:34.188 --> 01:26:35.557
REDUCE GUN VIOLENCE AND AGAIN

01:26:35.623 --> 01:26:36.824
THIS THESE HAD ARE KIND OF OUR

01:26:36.891 --> 01:26:38.493
HARDEST HIT COMMUNITIES THAT.

01:26:38.560 --> 01:26:39.093
THE NEED THESE RESOURCES SO I

01:26:39.160 --> 01:26:40.628
WAS CURIOUS ABOUT. AND THE

01:26:40.695 --> 01:26:42.630
THINKING BEHIND THAT- AND THEN

01:26:42.697 --> 01:26:43.898
THE OTHER QUESTION I HAD FOR

01:26:43.965 --> 01:26:45.567
YOU WAS- AROUND THE GOVERNOR'S

01:26:45.633 --> 01:26:48.202
NEW- APPROACH TO HOMELESSNESS-

01:26:48.269 --> 01:26:50.038
AND HOW DOES THIS SORT OF. HOW

01:26:50.104 --> 01:26:51.506
DOES IT WORK OR DEFER OR

01:26:51.573 --> 01:26:53.007
COMPLEMENT. AND THE WORK TO

01:26:53.074 --> 01:26:53.942
LOOK LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE

01:26:54.008 --> 01:26:55.243
DOING KIND OF WHAT'S THE VISION

01:26:55.310 --> 01:26:58.079
AROUND THERE FOR THE GOVERNOR'S

01:26:58.146 --> 01:27:00.848
TO HOMELESSNESS PLAN. YES SO ON

01:27:00.915 --> 01:27:02.784
THE FIRST POINT FOR CALVET- SO

01:27:02.850 --> 01:27:04.519
IN THAT PREVIOUS YEARS. IT WE

01:27:04.586 --> 01:27:05.753
HAD NINE MILLION DOLLARS BEFORE

01:27:05.820 --> 01:27:07.655
LAST YEAR'S BUDGET ACT- BUT

01:27:07.722 --> 01:27:09.023
THAT FUNDING WAS ALWAYS ONE

01:27:09.090 --> 01:27:10.725
TIME AND SO IT WAS ALWAYS A BIG

01:27:10.792 --> 01:27:12.360
LAST- AS I KNOW. MANY OF YOU

01:27:12.427 --> 01:27:14.295
KNOW. TO RE AUTHORIZE A FOR THE

01:27:14.362 --> 01:27:16.197
COMING YEAR SO WHAT LAST YEAR'S

01:27:16.264 --> 01:27:18.700
BUDGET DID WISE- MAKE THAT NINE

01:27:18.766 --> 01:27:19.867
MILLION DOLLARS ON GOING AND

01:27:19.934 --> 01:27:21.769
THEN ON TOP OF THAT. PUT A AND

01:27:21.836 --> 01:27:22.937
YOU KNOW WHAT WAS EIGHTEEN

01:27:23.004 --> 01:27:23.905
ENDED UP BEING TWENTY ONE

01:27:23.972 --> 01:27:24.973
MILLION DOLLARS OF ADDITIONAL

01:27:25.039 --> 01:27:26.874
ONE TIME FUNDING- SO WHAT THIS

01:27:26.941 --> 01:27:28.209
BUDGET DOES IS BRING IT BACK TO

01:27:28.276 --> 01:27:29.677
THEIR ON GOING LEVEL THAT IS

01:27:29.744 --> 01:27:30.945
NOW. YOU KNOW UNLESS THERE'S A

01:27:31.012 --> 01:27:32.780
RECESSION OR SOME TYPE OF. MORE

01:27:32.847 --> 01:27:34.315
MAJOR SURGERY ON THE BUDGET. IT

01:27:34.382 --> 01:27:35.683
WILL CONTINUE TO BE NINE NINE

01:27:35.750 --> 01:27:36.951
YEAR AFTER YEAR AND THEN ANY

01:27:37.018 --> 01:27:38.486
ONE TIME MINING. MONEY WOULD BE

01:27:38.553 --> 01:27:40.188
ON TOP OF THAT- BUT THIS BUDGET

01:27:40.254 --> 01:27:41.556
DOESN'T PROPOSE ANY ADDITIONAL

01:27:41.623 --> 01:27:43.424
ONE TIME MONEYON THE ON GOING.

01:27:43.491 --> 01:27:44.425
OUT WITH REGARD TO THE

01:27:44.492 --> 01:27:45.927
HOMELESSNESS- I THINK THE WORD

01:27:45.994 --> 01:27:46.894
TO USE WAS COMPLEMENT AND

01:27:46.961 --> 01:27:47.895
THAT'S EXACTLY HOW THE

01:27:47.962 --> 01:27:49.330
ADMINISTRATION. IS THINKING

01:27:49.397 --> 01:27:51.099
ABOUT THIS IN PARTICULAR AT THE

01:27:51.165 --> 01:27:52.734
NEW FIND- WHERE WE KNOW THAT WE

01:27:52.800 --> 01:27:54.502
HAVE A LOT OF DETAILS- THAT

01:27:54.569 --> 01:27:55.603
NEED TO BE RELEASED IN

01:27:55.670 --> 01:27:57.605
RELATIVELY SHORT ORDER AND- MY

01:27:57.672 --> 01:27:59.440
COLLEAGUES ARE WORKING ON THAT-

01:27:59.507 --> 01:28:00.475
BUT IT'S A SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY

01:28:00.541 --> 01:28:01.309
MILLION DOLLAR FUND WAS THE

01:28:01.376 --> 01:28:02.910
LEVEL OF THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED.

01:28:02.977 --> 01:28:04.812
AND IT'S NOT REPLACING COUNTY

01:28:04.879 --> 01:28:06.347
OR CITY SERVICES ARE ENGAGING

01:28:06.414 --> 01:28:06.848
IN THE SORTS OF SOCIAL

01:28:06.914 --> 01:28:08.616
SERVICES. IT'S DESIGNED TO

01:28:08.683 --> 01:28:10.184
COMPLEMENT THOSE BY NUMBER ONE

01:28:10.251 --> 01:28:11.686
TAKING A REGIONAL APPROACH.

01:28:11.753 --> 01:28:12.987
NUMBER TWO FOCUSED ON THREE

01:28:13.054 --> 01:28:14.656
SPECIFIC AREAS WHICH ARE

01:28:14.722 --> 01:28:17.025
STABILIZING BORN HE CARE HOMES-

01:28:17.091 --> 01:28:18.726
HOTEL MOTEL CONVERSIONS AND

01:28:18.793 --> 01:28:19.727
BROADER AFFORDABLE HOUSING

01:28:19.794 --> 01:28:21.362
DEVELOPMENT. AND FINALLY RENTAL

01:28:21.429 --> 01:28:22.930
SUBSIDIES AND MAKING SURE THAT

01:28:22.997 --> 01:28:23.965
WE HAVE A REGIONAL APPROACH

01:28:24.032 --> 01:28:25.833
WITH ADMINISTRATORS. OVERSEEN

01:28:25.900 --> 01:28:26.768
BY THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL

01:28:26.834 --> 01:28:29.037
SERVICES- YOUR FOR THE STATE.

01:28:29.103 --> 01:28:30.738
AND WITH A LOT OF PERFORMANCE

01:28:30.805 --> 01:28:32.006
METRICS AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND

01:28:32.073 --> 01:28:33.508
SO WE'RE WORKING ON THAT

01:28:33.574 --> 01:28:34.976
GOVERNANCE MODEL RIGHT NOW- WE

01:28:35.043 --> 01:28:35.877
KNOW WE HAVE A LOT OF WORKING

01:28:35.943 --> 01:28:37.578
DISCUSSION TO HAVE WITH ALL OF

01:28:37.645 --> 01:28:39.614
YOU- BUT- THAT. KEY POINT I DO

01:28:39.681 --> 01:28:41.315
WANT TO MAKE IS THAT CITIES AND

01:28:41.382 --> 01:28:42.116
COUNTIES WE UNDERSTAND THE

01:28:42.183 --> 01:28:43.785
ROLE. THE SIX HUNDRED FIFTY

01:28:43.851 --> 01:28:44.986
NINE DOLLARS THAT WAS IN LAST

01:28:45.053 --> 01:28:46.120
YEAR'S BUDGET THAT FLOW TO THEM

01:28:46.187 --> 01:28:48.022
AS WELL AS CONVENIENCE OF CARE.

01:28:48.089 --> 01:28:48.990
IS JUST GOING OUT THE DOOR

01:28:49.057 --> 01:28:50.191
RIGHT NOW I KNOW THE GOVERNOR

01:28:50.258 --> 01:28:52.026

FRUSTRATION THAT IT HASN'T GONE

01:28:55.063 --> 01:28:56.030
OUT EARLIER. SO WE'LL BE

01:28:56.097 --> 01:29:00.301
TRACKING THAT MONEY CLOSELY AND

01:29:00.368 --> 01:29:00.902
YOU KNOW HOPEFULLY WE'LL HAVE

01:29:00.968 --> 01:29:03.104
THE INTENDED EFFECT AND THEN.

01:29:03.171 --> 01:29:03.905
FUTURE BUDGET BUDGET SO I. WELL

01:29:03.971 --> 01:29:04.472

STRUCK. BEST FIT TOGETHER.

01:29:06.774 --> 01:29:09.410
THANK YOU MISTER. YEAH A COUPLE

01:29:09.477 --> 01:29:12.313
QUESTIONS- FIRST A ON THE

01:29:12.380 --> 01:29:14.415
HIGHER EDUCATION SIDE OF THINGS

01:29:14.482 --> 01:29:15.717
WE KNOW THAT THE REGION'S JUST

01:29:15.783 --> 01:29:17.952
PUT OFF THE VOTE TO DO A

01:29:18.019 --> 01:29:20.488
TUITION INCREASE OF THE SYSTEM

01:29:20.555 --> 01:29:21.723
IS VERY CONCERNING FOR ALL OF

01:29:21.789 --> 01:29:24.258
US WE- WE'VE- MADE SOME

01:29:24.325 --> 01:29:26.427
SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS LAST

01:29:26.494 --> 01:29:26.961
YEAR AGAIN IN THE PROPOSED

01:29:27.028 --> 01:29:28.663
BUDGET THIS YEAR. ANOTHER

01:29:28.730 --> 01:29:31.466
SIGNIFICANT INCREASE- AND

01:29:31.532 --> 01:29:33.768
HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING- WHAT

01:29:33.835 --> 01:29:36.070
IS. YOUR GUYS POSITION AS TO

01:29:36.137 --> 01:29:38.539
WHETHER OR NOT HE NEEDS TO BE A

01:29:38.606 --> 01:29:40.575
TUITION INCREASE AT UC. SO THAT

01:29:40.641 --> 01:29:42.143
AS YOU MENTIONED- GOVERNOR'S

01:29:42.210 --> 01:29:44.412
BUDGET PROPOSES A 5% INCREASE

01:29:44.479 --> 01:29:45.713
IN BASE LEVEL FUNDING FOR YOU

01:29:45.780 --> 01:29:47.849
SEE- AND THE GOVERNOR HAS MADE

01:29:47.915 --> 01:29:48.616
CLEAR THAT HE BELIEVES

01:29:48.683 --> 01:29:49.984
SITUATION INCREASES NOT

01:29:50.051 --> 01:29:51.819
WARRANTED AT THIS TIME. AND IS

01:29:51.886 --> 01:29:53.788
THAT ALSO YOUR VIEW AS AT DEAL

01:29:53.855 --> 01:29:56.357
HALF SO WE SPEAK FOR THE

01:29:56.424 --> 01:29:58.760
ADMINISTRATION. I MEAN BUT I

01:29:58.826 --> 01:29:59.994
MEAN JUST IN YOUR GUISES OWN

01:30:00.061 --> 01:30:02.864
ANALYSIS OF THE FUNDING. AND

01:30:02.930 --> 01:30:04.165
WHAT'S NEEDED AND THEN

01:30:04.232 --> 01:30:07.368
RESOURCES THERE DOESN'T NEED TO

01:30:07.435 --> 01:30:10.171
BE A TUITION INCREASE RIGHT. WE

01:30:10.238 --> 01:30:11.706
SUPPORT THAT GOVERNOR'S BELIEF

01:30:11.773 --> 01:30:13.174
THAT THIS BASE LEVEL INCREASE

01:30:13.241 --> 01:30:19.981
OF 5% IS. WITH REGARD TO- THE

01:30:20.047 --> 01:30:23.985
CAP AND TRADE EXPENDITURE PLAN.

01:30:24.051 --> 01:30:25.853
THE ONLY- YOU KNOW HAD HAS

01:30:25.920 --> 01:30:28.256
RECENTLY DONE AN ANALYSIS OF

01:30:28.322 --> 01:30:31.092
OUR CLIMB IT PROGRAMS. AND ONE

01:30:31.159 --> 01:30:31.893
OF THE THINGS THAT THEY

01:30:31.959 --> 01:30:34.128
RECOMMEND TOWARDS THE END IS

01:30:34.195 --> 01:30:35.296
THAT THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD

01:30:35.363 --> 01:30:37.398
REALLY START THINKING ABOUT HOW

01:30:37.465 --> 01:30:39.133
TO HOW TO REALLY INVEST THE

01:30:39.200 --> 01:30:42.303
MOST COST EFFECTIVE PROGRAMS TO

01:30:42.370 --> 01:30:46.541
REDUCE CARBON. ONE OF THOSE ONE

01:30:46.607 --> 01:30:49.544
OF THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE IS-

01:30:49.610 --> 01:30:51.279
FORESTRY MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES

01:30:51.345 --> 01:30:53.181
I THINK IN FACT DELEON IS

01:30:53.247 --> 01:30:54.582
ESTIMATES ABOUT TWENTY FOUR

01:30:54.649 --> 01:30:57.685
DOLLARS PER TON OF CARBON

01:30:57.752 --> 01:31:00.588
REDUCED- WE'VE BEEN MAKING

01:31:00.655 --> 01:31:02.323
SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS THERE

01:31:02.390 --> 01:31:05.626
BUT REALLY THAT'S ONLY HAPPENED

01:31:05.693 --> 01:31:09.197
YOU IN THE LAST TWO YEARS.

01:31:09.263 --> 01:31:10.431
SINCE THAT IS ONE OF THE MORE

01:31:10.498 --> 01:31:12.033
COST EFFECTIVE READ AND NOT

01:31:12.099 --> 01:31:14.035
JUST BY WAY OF COMPARISON OUR

01:31:14.101 --> 01:31:17.638
PS WAS ESTIMATED BY THE LA- TO

01:31:17.705 --> 01:31:18.439
BE ABOUT SIXTY TO EIGHTY

01:31:18.506 --> 01:31:20.741
DOLLARS. PER TON AND THEY SAID

01:31:20.808 --> 01:31:22.043
THAT'S ACTUALLY ON THE LOWER

01:31:22.109 --> 01:31:24.478
END OF THE ESTIMATE- IF YOU

01:31:24.545 --> 01:31:25.746
TOOK INTO ACCOUNT OTHER COSTS

01:31:25.813 --> 01:31:27.248
LIKE INTEGRATION COSTS

01:31:27.315 --> 01:31:29.951
TRANSMISSION COSTS ASSOCIATED

01:31:30.017 --> 01:31:32.587
THERE WITH- STE THE SOLAR

01:31:32.653 --> 01:31:33.921
INITIATIVE HAS BEEN EVEN

01:31:33.988 --> 01:31:35.489
GREATER LIKE TWO HUNDRED

01:31:35.556 --> 01:31:38.292
DOLLARS PER TON. SO ISN'T THERE

01:31:38.359 --> 01:31:39.961
AN ARGUMENT THERE FOR REALLY

01:31:40.027 --> 01:31:41.963
EVEN DO EVEN MORE. AND I

01:31:42.029 --> 01:31:43.397
APPLAUD THE GOVERNOR FOR MAKING

01:31:43.464 --> 01:31:45.967
THE INVESTMENT. YOU KNOW THIS

01:31:46.033 --> 01:31:47.301
IS ALSO I SEE PROTECTING US

01:31:47.368 --> 01:31:49.303
FROM CATASTROPHIC WILD FIRE BY

01:31:49.370 --> 01:31:51.372
REDUCING FUELS. MEN ARE

01:31:51.439 --> 01:31:52.640
VEGETATED LANDS BUT JUST FROM A

01:31:52.707 --> 01:31:54.542
CLIMATE PERSPECTIVE AND BASED

01:31:54.609 --> 01:31:57.345
ON THE LA OWES. RECOMMENDATION

01:31:57.411 --> 01:31:58.179
I BE HAPPY HERE FROM THEM AS

01:31:58.246 --> 01:32:00.715
WELL. SHOULD WE BE DOING EVEN

01:32:00.781 --> 01:32:04.085
MORE. IN THIS FEAR WORDS A MORE

01:32:04.151 --> 01:32:06.621
COST EFFECTIVE WAY OF REDUCING

01:32:06.687 --> 01:32:09.523
CARBON EMISSIONS FROM SO MAKE A

01:32:09.590 --> 01:32:11.125
SPECIFIC POINT IN THAT ALSO A

01:32:11.192 --> 01:32:12.693
MORE GENERAL POINT ON THE

01:32:12.760 --> 01:32:13.861
SPECIFIC POINT OF FORESTRY

01:32:13.928 --> 01:32:15.930
MANAGEMENT- AS YOU NOTED UNDER

01:32:15.997 --> 01:32:17.765
SB NINE OH ONE THERE IS THAT

01:32:17.832 --> 01:32:18.733
GENERAL TWO HUNDRED MILLION

01:32:18.799 --> 01:32:20.668
DOLLARS- PER YEAR INVESTMENT

01:32:20.735 --> 01:32:22.303
AND THAT IS INCLUDED THIS YEAR

01:32:22.370 --> 01:32:23.905
AND THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS AS

01:32:23.971 --> 01:32:25.973
WELL. IN ADDITION A NEW IN THIS

01:32:26.040 --> 01:32:27.775
BUDGET IS AN EIGHTY MILLION

01:32:27.842 --> 01:32:29.110
DOLLAR INVESTMENT IN THIS WHITE

01:32:29.176 --> 01:32:31.012
OUR TECHNOLOGY AND THAT SHOULD

01:32:31.078 --> 01:32:31.712
HELP WITH VEGETATION

01:32:31.779 --> 01:32:33.481
MANAGEMENT- AND SOME OF THESE

01:32:33.547 --> 01:32:34.615
ISSUES AND MAKING SURE THAT

01:32:34.682 --> 01:32:35.650
WE'RE AT THE CUTTING EDGE IN

01:32:35.716 --> 01:32:36.384
TERMS OF HOW WE'RE USING

01:32:36.450 --> 01:32:38.786
TECHNOLOGY TO REALLY IMPROVE

01:32:38.853 --> 01:32:40.721
OUR MANAGEMENT. OF THESE AREAS

01:32:40.788 --> 01:32:42.189
ON THE BROADER POINT I THINK

01:32:42.256 --> 01:32:43.858
I'LL JUST SAY THAT ONE OF THE

01:32:43.925 --> 01:32:46.160
REASONS THAT THIS BUDGET- TAKES

01:32:46.227 --> 01:32:47.728
THIS BROADER TWELVE AND A HALF

01:32:47.795 --> 01:32:49.196
BILLION DOLLAR APPROACH IN WHAT

01:32:49.263 --> 01:32:50.331
WE'RE CALLING THE OVERALL TO

01:32:50.398 --> 01:32:51.899
FIND A BUDGET WHICH IS NOT

01:32:51.966 --> 01:32:53.000
NECESSARILY A PHRASE OR AN

01:32:53.067 --> 01:32:54.135
APPROACH YOU'VE SEEN IN RECENT

01:32:54.201 --> 01:32:56.137
YEARS- IS EXACTLY YOUR POINT

01:32:56.203 --> 01:32:58.139
THAT- WE DON'T WHAT WE DON'T

01:32:58.205 --> 01:32:59.440
WANT IS A SCATTER SHOT APPROACH

01:32:59.507 --> 01:33:00.741
THIS PROGRAM SEEMS GUIDE.

01:33:00.808 --> 01:33:02.677
PROGRAMS YOU PRETTY GOOD TOO

01:33:02.743 --> 01:33:03.911
INSTEAD YOU WANT TO LOOK AT ALL

01:33:03.978 --> 01:33:05.313
THE INVESTMENTS TOGETHER AND

01:33:05.379 --> 01:33:06.614
THAT'S CERTAINLY THE GENERAL

01:33:06.681 --> 01:33:09.350
APPROACH THAT WE WANT TO CHECK

01:33:09.417 --> 01:33:13.220
WITH THIS BUDGET. I AM BROWN

01:33:13.287 --> 01:33:15.556
WITH THE LA AGAIN. MAYBE TWO

01:33:15.623 --> 01:33:18.259
POINTS MAKE ONE AS SPECIFICALLY.

01:33:18.326 --> 01:33:19.527
THINKING ABOUT COST BENEFIT

01:33:19.593 --> 01:33:21.595
ANALYSIS IN TERMS OF OUR- CAP

01:33:21.662 --> 01:33:22.930
AND TRADE EXPENDITURES OR OR

01:33:22.997 --> 01:33:26.167
WAITER DIRECTOR- OUR LIMITED

01:33:26.233 --> 01:33:27.802
RESOURCES TOWARD DIFFERENT

01:33:27.868 --> 01:33:30.137
CLIENT MITIGATION ACTIVITIES.

01:33:30.204 --> 01:33:32.373
WE HAVE DEFINITELY ARGUED IN

01:33:32.440 --> 01:33:33.240
THE PAST OVER SEVERAL

01:33:33.307 --> 01:33:34.575
PUBLICATIONS AND THROUGHOUT THE

01:33:34.642 --> 01:33:35.643
BUDGET PROCESS THE LAST FEW

01:33:35.710 --> 01:33:37.144
YEARS THAT SHOULD BE ONE

01:33:37.211 --> 01:33:39.847
IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION- AND I

01:33:39.914 --> 01:33:40.848
THINK ONE OF THE CHALLENGES

01:33:40.915 --> 01:33:42.850
WE'VE HAD IS IN SOME CASES-

01:33:42.917 --> 01:33:44.285
SUCH AS YOU REFERENCED-

01:33:44.352 --> 01:33:45.119
PARTICULAR WITH OUR RECENT

01:33:45.186 --> 01:33:48.122
pREPORT ON. ENERGY GENERATION

01:33:48.189 --> 01:33:49.890
PROGRAMS WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO

01:33:49.957 --> 01:33:52.259
OUR OWN ANALYSIS OF- IN

01:33:52.326 --> 01:33:54.562
ESTIMATES OF WHAT THE COST

01:33:54.628 --> 01:33:55.629
BENEFIT RATIO IS FOR DIFFERENT

01:33:55.696 --> 01:33:57.164
PROGRAMS WE DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE

01:33:57.231 --> 01:33:59.767
THAT WIDELY FOR ALL- PROGRAM

01:33:59.834 --> 01:34:01.002
THE INITIATION HAS DONE AN

01:34:01.068 --> 01:34:03.104
ANNUAL REPORT BUT I HINK WE

01:34:03.170 --> 01:34:04.972
HAVE ANY. SORT OF VALIDATE ALL

01:34:05.039 --> 01:34:06.574
THOSE ESTIMATES THAT MAKE YOUR

01:34:06.640 --> 01:34:07.675
JOB A LITTLE BIT MORE DIFFICULT

01:34:07.742 --> 01:34:09.343
IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO

01:34:09.410 --> 01:34:11.145
PRIORITIZE BUT I THINK MAYBE A

01:34:11.212 --> 01:34:12.313
SECOND POINT TO IS THAT YOU'RE

01:34:12.380 --> 01:34:13.681
LOOKING AT THE CAP AND TRADE

01:34:13.748 --> 01:34:16.584
EXPENDITURE PLAN WHICH WERE

01:34:16.650 --> 01:34:17.151
CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF

01:34:17.218 --> 01:34:19.620
REVIEWING. AS WE DISCUSSED IN

01:34:19.687 --> 01:34:21.989
THE CONTACT OF AB SIXTY

01:34:22.056 --> 01:34:23.090
SEVENTEEN FOR EXAMPLE. YOUR

01:34:23.157 --> 01:34:24.792
OVERALL EXPENDITURE PACKAGE IS

01:34:24.859 --> 01:34:27.028
A BIT LOWER- THAN IT WAS IN

01:34:27.094 --> 01:34:29.096
THIS PAST YEAR. IN SO YOU'RE

01:34:29.163 --> 01:34:29.830
GOING TO FACE SOME DIFFICULT

01:34:29.897 --> 01:34:31.165
DECISIONS ABOUT WHERE TO

01:34:31.232 --> 01:34:33.634
PRIORITIZE THOSE DOLLARS- THE

01:34:33.701 --> 01:34:35.403
INEFFICIENT COMPORT WITH ONE

01:34:35.469 --> 01:34:37.371
WAY TO DO THAT. BUT CERTAINLY

01:34:37.438 --> 01:34:39.140
TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU- AS A

01:34:39.206 --> 01:34:40.608
BODY HAVE A DIFFERENT SET OF

01:34:40.674 --> 01:34:42.343
PRIORITIES WHETHER THAT'S BASED

01:34:42.410 --> 01:34:43.444
PACIFIC LAND COST BENEFIT

01:34:43.511 --> 01:34:44.812
ANALYSIS OR THE OTHER TYPES OF

01:34:44.879 --> 01:34:45.713
CONSIDERATIONS THAT ARE

01:34:45.780 --> 01:34:47.681
IMPORTANT AS WELL. SUCH AS-

01:34:47.748 --> 01:34:50.117
THE- CO BENEFITS WHETHER THE-

01:34:50.184 --> 01:34:51.886
REDUCTION AND OTHER- CO

01:34:51.952 --> 01:34:53.788
POLLUTANTS OR OTHER PUBLIC

01:34:53.854 --> 01:34:55.389
SAFETY INTEREST THAT YOU MIGHT

01:34:55.456 --> 01:34:56.557
HAVE THE OTHER PUBLIC SAFETY

01:34:56.624 --> 01:34:58.125
AND- PUBLIC BENEFIT INTEREST

01:34:58.192 --> 01:34:59.827
THAT YOU HAVE. WE THINK THOSE

01:34:59.894 --> 01:35:00.461
ARE ALL THINGS THAT YOU SHOULD

01:35:00.528 --> 01:35:02.797
PROBABLY BALANCE IN CRAFTING AN

01:35:02.863 --> 01:35:05.066
OVERALL CAP AND TRADE

01:35:05.132 --> 01:35:10.004
EXPENDITURE PLAN. JUST LAST

01:35:10.071 --> 01:35:12.506
QUESTION WAS ON ON THE- POST

01:35:12.573 --> 01:35:16.811
CLIMATE RESILIENCY BOND- I

01:35:16.877 --> 01:35:19.080
THINK YOU GUYS HAVE IDENTIFIED

01:35:19.146 --> 01:35:21.415
FLOOD CONTROL IS I MEAN.

01:35:21.482 --> 01:35:23.217

ALWAYS HAS BEEN AND WE'VE

01:35:28.489 --> 01:35:29.223

HAD DISCUSSIONS ABOUT TRYING TO

01:35:48.909 --> 01:35:50.711
REALLY INCREASE THE INVESTMENT

01:35:50.778 --> 01:35:52.613
THAT WE NEED TO MAKE I BELIEVE

01:35:52.680 --> 01:35:53.314
THE CENTRAL VALLEY FLOOD

01:35:53.380 --> 01:35:56.417
PROTECTION PLAN IDENTIFIES

01:35:56.484 --> 01:35:57.985
TWENTY SEVEN BILLION. THERE WE

OVER HALF OF IT- IS DEVOTED TO

01:36:19.340 --> 01:36:20.541
A WATER PRIORITIES AND THAT'S

01:36:20.608 --> 01:36:21.775
MORE THAN FLOOD UNITS ALSO

01:36:21.842 --> 01:36:23.744
DROUGHT AND- OTHER ISSUES BUT A

01:36:23.811 --> 01:36:25.346

A THREE G. COURSE IS. GETTING

01:40:34.528 --> 01:40:35.629
READY TO GO ON TO COLLEGE WE

01:40:35.696 --> 01:40:37.131
KNOW OUR ECONOMY NEEDS FOR

01:40:37.197 --> 01:40:38.932
COLLEGE. GRADUATES ITS IT'S-

01:40:38.999 --> 01:40:41.235
IT'S CRYSTAL CLEAR. AND THIS IS

01:40:41.301 --> 01:40:43.036
A SOLID BUDGET FOR THE SYSTEMS.

01:40:43.103 --> 01:40:45.305
BUT THERE'S NOT ONE PENNY. TO

01:40:45.372 --> 01:40:47.007
EXPAND ACCESS FOR THE UC AND

01:40:47.074 --> 01:40:49.943
CSU SYSTEMS THERE'S SOME CSU

01:40:50.010 --> 01:40:51.378
I'M SORRY SOME YOU SEE IN ROMAN

01:40:51.445 --> 01:40:51.979
BUT IT'S REALLY A COMMITMENT

01:40:52.045 --> 01:40:54.014
FROM. THE LAST YEAR'S BUDGET

01:40:54.081 --> 01:40:56.049
SO. THAT I THINK IT'S AN

01:40:56.116 --> 01:40:56.884
UNFINISHED BUSINESS SO WE NEED

01:40:56.950 --> 01:41:00.721
TO. TO FIGURE OUT. AND YOU KNOW

01:41:00.788 --> 01:41:02.222
I KNOW YOU OPPOSE THE STUDENT

01:41:02.289 --> 01:41:04.124
FEE HIKES- JUST WONDER WHAT

01:41:04.191 --> 01:41:10.330
YOUR THOUGHTS ON. AS A GO DOWN.

01:41:10.397 --> 01:41:11.198
THIS BUDGET PROCESS. ON

01:41:11.265 --> 01:41:12.566
EXPANDING. THROUGH THE- ROLAND

01:41:12.633 --> 01:41:15.536
SO. AT THE UC AND CSU. SO THAT

01:41:15.602 --> 01:41:17.037
MY ONE QUESTION THIS MORNING

01:41:17.104 --> 01:41:18.071
THIS AFTERNOON FOR THE

01:41:18.138 --> 01:41:19.940
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO THANK

01:41:20.007 --> 01:41:21.642
YOU SELDOM MAKE TWO BRIEF

01:41:21.708 --> 01:41:22.409
POINTS AND THEN TURN IT OVER TO

01:41:22.476 --> 01:41:24.278
MY COLLEAGUE CHRIS FARLEY SAID

01:41:24.344 --> 01:41:25.746
I THINK THE FIRST DAYS OUR

01:41:25.813 --> 01:41:27.848
BUDGET PROPOSES A 5% INCREASE

01:41:27.915 --> 01:41:29.850
AND AS- YOU KNOW THAT'S ON TOP

01:41:29.917 --> 01:41:31.118
OF THE EVEN BIGGER INCREASED AT

01:41:31.185 --> 01:41:32.986
THE SYSTEMS RECEIVED LAST YEAR

01:41:33.053 --> 01:41:34.321
SO WE THINK THIS IS SCALABLE

01:41:34.388 --> 01:41:36.690
INCREASES IN FUNDING- CAN MAKE

01:41:36.757 --> 01:41:37.558
A DIFFERENCE AND GIVE THE

01:41:37.624 --> 01:41:39.092
SYSTEM SOME FLEXIBILITY AS WE

01:41:39.159 --> 01:41:40.727
WORK WITH THEM TO. INCREASE

01:41:40.794 --> 01:41:42.129
ENROLLMENT AND THEN THE SECOND

01:41:42.196 --> 01:41:43.564
POINT I MAKE IS THAT THE

01:41:43.630 --> 01:41:44.731
LEGISLATURE PLACED- NOT

01:41:44.798 --> 01:41:46.200
EDUCATION BOND OUT ON THE

01:41:46.266 --> 01:41:47.835
BALLOT FOR MARCH AND THAT

01:41:47.901 --> 01:41:49.336
INCLUDES FOUR BILLION DOLLARS

01:41:49.403 --> 01:41:51.071
UPON FINDING IF VOTERS APPROVE

01:41:51.138 --> 01:41:54.608
IT- FOR UC AND CSU AND SO A LOT

01:41:54.675 --> 01:41:55.375
OF THAT WOULD GO TOWARD

01:41:55.442 --> 01:41:56.810
FACILITIES SO TO THE EXTENT

01:41:56.877 --> 01:41:57.911
THAT SOME OF THESE ACCESS

01:41:57.978 --> 01:41:59.947
PROBLEMS ARE CAUSED BY A LACK

01:42:00.013 --> 01:42:00.848
OF AVAILABLE OR MODERNIZE

01:42:00.914 --> 01:42:02.649
FACILITIES. THAT MONEY COULD

01:42:02.716 --> 01:42:03.817
HELP WITH THAT ISSUE AS WELL

01:42:03.884 --> 01:42:04.551
AND THAT OF COURSE WILL BE

01:42:04.618 --> 01:42:06.653
SUSTAINED- BY GENERAL FUND

01:42:06.720 --> 01:42:11.492
PAYMENTS OVER FUTURE YEARS- AND

01:42:11.558 --> 01:42:12.092
MY COLLEAGUE MAY ONE LAP RACE

01:42:12.159 --> 01:42:14.228
WELL. SURE CHRIS FERGUSON

01:42:14.294 --> 01:42:15.529
PLAYING. I THINK WE WILL WANT

01:42:15.596 --> 01:42:17.130
TO ADD THAT. WALL THERE ARE GEN

01:42:17.197 --> 01:42:18.432
INCREASES PROVIDE APPROVAL THE

01:42:18.499 --> 01:42:20.367

EXPECTATIONS. THAT BOTH THE

01:42:23.103 --> 01:42:24.938
REGIONS AND THE TRUSTEES-

01:42:25.005 --> 01:42:26.740
CONSIDER THAT FUNDING IN TERMS

01:42:26.807 --> 01:42:29.176
OF ACCESS IN TERMS OF-

01:42:29.243 --> 01:42:31.311
AFFORDABILITY IN TERMS OF.

01:42:31.378 --> 01:42:33.146

FEELS THAT. AND BUT I THINK WE

01:44:09.776 --> 01:44:11.078

SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER YOU KNOW

01:44:55.789 --> 01:44:56.823
THIS YEAR THINK IT'S ALLOCATE

01:44:56.890 --> 01:44:58.692
AT TWO HUNDRED MILLION- LAST

01:44:58.759 --> 01:45:00.260
YEAR WAS LOWER AND FOR ME

01:45:00.327 --> 01:45:01.728
THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT AREAS

01:45:01.795 --> 01:45:04.564
LIKE MY DISTRICT IN LOS ANGELES

01:45:04.631 --> 01:45:09.102
BUT ALSO- FOR THE CENTRAL

01:45:09.169 --> 01:45:12.406
VALLEY AND- OTHER UNDERSERVED.

01:45:12.472 --> 01:45:12.939
AREAS WHERE THE DEAL WITH

01:45:13.006 --> 01:45:16.009
EXTREME HEAT IN HOW. THESE ARE

01:45:16.076 --> 01:45:18.812
IN IN MITIGATING THAT IN THESE

01:45:18.879 --> 01:45:20.847

THERE'S NOT THAT MUCH SPACE

01:45:29.823 --> 01:45:31.158
ALREADY OPEN YOU DON'T URBAN

01:45:31.224 --> 01:45:33.994
DENSITY. AND SCHOOL YARDS ARE

01:45:34.061 --> 01:45:35.595
PERFECT FOR THAT AND

01:45:35.662 --> 01:45:37.464
UNFORTUNATELY WAS VETOED

01:45:37.531 --> 01:45:37.998

VALLEY AND FROM- BERKELEY AND-

01:46:09.262 --> 01:46:11.765
EXPRESSING HOW GRATEFUL I AM

01:46:11.832 --> 01:46:14.534
FOR THE ADMINISTRATION'S-

01:46:14.601 --> 01:46:16.103
EMPHASIZING HOMELESSNESS IS A

01:46:16.169 --> 01:46:18.205
PRIORITY IN THE IN THE BUDGET

01:46:18.271 --> 01:46:21.074
THIS YEAR. THE SEVEN HUNDRED

01:46:21.141 --> 01:46:22.542
AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR

01:46:22.609 --> 01:46:26.313
PACKAGE BOB. SEC HAVING SAID

01:46:26.379 --> 01:46:28.081
THAT TO THE SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY

01:46:28.148 --> 01:46:28.982
MILLION DOLLARS REALLY IN MY

01:46:29.049 --> 01:46:30.684
VIEW FALL SHORT OF WHAT WE

01:46:30.751 --> 01:46:33.253
SHOULD BE DOING- AND I THINK

01:46:33.320 --> 01:46:35.655
EVERYBODY WOULD AGREE- THAT WE

01:46:35.722 --> 01:46:37.124
SHOULD BE TRYING TO DO MUCH

01:46:37.190 --> 01:46:40.460
MORE SO I'M- HOPING- THAT TO

01:46:40.527 --> 01:46:43.663
WHEN WE GET TO MAY REVISE TIME

01:46:43.730 --> 01:46:45.499
IF THERE ARE ADDITIONAL

01:46:45.565 --> 01:46:48.101
REVENUES AVAILABLE THAT WE WILL

01:46:48.168 --> 01:46:50.170
AGAIN EMPHASIZED THIS AND I'M

01:46:50.237 --> 01:46:51.872
HOPING THAT MY COLLEAGUES OF.

01:46:51.938 --> 01:46:53.740
WILL EXPRESS THAT MESSAGE AS WE

01:46:53.807 --> 01:46:56.643
MOVE FORWARD- SO THAT THAT IS A

01:46:56.710 --> 01:46:58.044
UNIFIED PRIORITY FOR BOTH THE

01:46:58.111 --> 01:46:59.946
LEGISLATURE AND THE

01:47:00.013 --> 01:47:02.616
ADMINISTRATION- WITH RESPECT TO

01:47:02.682 --> 01:47:04.384
THE PRIORITIES AND THE NATURE

01:47:04.451 --> 01:47:09.022
OF THESE FUNDS. VIRTUALLY ALL

01:47:09.089 --> 01:47:10.090
OF THE IMPORTANT CARE ON WHICH

01:47:10.157 --> 01:47:12.058
I'M CARRYING SOME LEGISLATION

01:47:12.125 --> 01:47:13.994
AND- CORRECTING WHAT IS OF A

01:47:14.060 --> 01:47:17.063
BROKEN SYSTEM- BUYING UP HOTELS

01:47:17.130 --> 01:47:19.466
AND MOTELS AND RE PURPOSING

01:47:19.533 --> 01:47:20.901
THEM FOR HOMELESS WHICH IS IN

01:47:20.967 --> 01:47:21.935
SOME CASES A DOUBLE EDGED

01:47:22.002 --> 01:47:24.838
SWORD. MANY OF THOSE MOTELS ARE

01:47:24.905 --> 01:47:26.873
CURRENTLY INHABITED- AS LOW

01:47:26.940 --> 01:47:28.441
INCOME HOUSING SO THERE'S A

01:47:28.508 --> 01:47:30.343
DISPLACEMENT ISSUE THAT WE HAVE

01:47:30.410 --> 01:47:32.512
TO DEAL WITH THAN THAT BUT- WE

01:47:32.579 --> 01:47:33.613
HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CREATE A LOT

01:47:33.680 --> 01:47:35.348
OF. A GREAT PERMITS PARK

01:47:35.415 --> 01:47:39.853
HOUSING IN MOTEL LOCATIONS. OF

01:47:39.920 --> 01:47:41.454
AND THEN FINALLY- RENT

01:47:41.521 --> 01:47:44.558
SUBSIDIES- ARE EXTREMELY

01:47:44.624 --> 01:47:45.826
IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT

01:47:45.892 --> 01:47:47.861
THERE ARE AT LEAST TEN OF THE

01:47:47.928 --> 01:47:48.929
CITY OF THE COUNTY OF LOS

01:47:48.995 --> 01:47:50.764
ANGELES A HUNDRED AND THIRTY

01:47:50.831 --> 01:47:53.400
THREE. INDIVIDUALS AT DAY OR

01:47:53.466 --> 01:47:56.236
BEING HOUSE BUT A HUNDRED AND

01:47:56.303 --> 01:47:57.704
FIFTY INDIVIDUALS ARE BECOMING

01:47:57.771 --> 01:48:00.207
HOMELESS AND THE- MAJOR REASON

01:48:00.273 --> 01:48:01.775
CAUSING THAT HOMELESSNESS IS AN

01:48:01.842 --> 01:48:05.612
INABILITY TO AFFORD- THE RENT

01:48:05.679 --> 01:48:08.615
AND THAT ONE IS PAYING. A TWO

01:48:08.682 --> 01:48:11.685
FORTY THE COST OF HOUSING. MY

01:48:11.751 --> 01:48:13.854
POINT THOUGH IS THAT ALL OF

01:48:13.920 --> 01:48:15.856
THESE ARE ONGOING ISSUES

01:48:15.922 --> 01:48:19.059
THEY'RE NOT- REALLY ONE TIME

01:48:19.125 --> 01:48:21.828
CONCERNS AND SO I WANT TO URGE

01:48:21.895 --> 01:48:24.231
THE ADMINISTRATION TO FIND AN

01:48:24.297 --> 01:48:28.702
ON GOING- SUPPLY OF FUNDS TO

01:48:28.768 --> 01:48:30.370
ADDRESS THESE ISSUES THEY'RE

01:48:30.437 --> 01:48:31.938
NOT GOING TO GO AWAY THIS YEAR.

01:48:32.005 --> 01:48:33.039
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO GO AWAY

01:48:33.106 --> 01:48:35.942
NEXT YEAR AND IT'S- WELL WE'D

01:48:36.009 --> 01:48:37.677
LIKE TO FOR SEE THE TIME WHEN

01:48:37.744 --> 01:48:40.013
WE REACH EQUILIBRIUM- OR BETTER

01:48:40.080 --> 01:48:42.782
ON ON THIS ISSUE IT'S NOT IN

01:48:42.849 --> 01:48:45.752
THE NEXT FEW YEARS- AND IT

01:48:45.819 --> 01:48:47.921
CERTAINLY WON'T BE UNLESS WE

01:48:47.988 --> 01:48:51.157
PROVIDE THAT ONGOING SOURCE OF-

01:48:51.224 --> 01:48:52.726
OF FUNDING. SO I THINK WE

01:48:52.792 --> 01:48:54.461
SHOULD ALL BE THINKING ABOUT

01:48:54.527 --> 01:48:58.231
HOW WE CAN ACCOMMODATE TO- TO

01:48:58.298 --> 01:49:02.369
THAT REALITY. SWITCHING GEARS-

01:49:02.435 --> 01:49:03.870
I WANTED TO ASK A QUESTION

01:49:03.937 --> 01:49:06.273
RELATING TO THE A BILLION

01:49:06.339 --> 01:49:08.808
DOLLAR- PACKAGE ON CLIMATE

01:49:08.875 --> 01:49:10.477
RESILIENCY THAT INVOLVES A

01:49:10.543 --> 01:49:12.946
REVOLVING. LOAN PROGRAM FOR

01:49:13.013 --> 01:49:14.114
SMALL THERE'S ONLY TWO HUNDRED

01:49:14.180 --> 01:49:16.549
FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN THIS

01:49:16.616 --> 01:49:20.420
YEAR BUDGET- AND IT'S A- THREE

01:49:20.487 --> 01:49:22.722
FOR THE OTHER STUFF FIFTY

01:49:22.789 --> 01:49:27.093
MILLION. COULD BE A ALLOCATE

01:49:27.160 --> 01:49:27.961
THE THAT'S REALLY UP PROMISES

01:49:28.028 --> 01:49:31.431
NOT A THIS YEAR BUDGET TO- OUT

01:49:31.498 --> 01:49:32.832
I JUST THINK WE NEED TO

01:49:32.899 --> 01:49:35.235
UNDERSTAND TO OF THE ACTUAL

01:49:35.302 --> 01:49:39.239
DOLLARS HERE. BUT AGAIN AS WITH

01:49:39.306 --> 01:49:41.107
MANY OF THE ISSUES THAT WE'VE

01:49:41.174 --> 01:49:42.542
HEARD ABOUT TODAY THERE'S NOT A

01:49:42.609 --> 01:49:44.010
LOT OF DETAIL IN THE IN THE

01:49:44.077 --> 01:49:46.146
BUDGET AND THE- NUMBER ONE

01:49:46.212 --> 01:49:48.882
QUESTION I HAVE IS- WHAT IS THE

01:49:48.949 --> 01:49:50.450
ROLE OF THE LEGISLATURE GOING

01:49:50.517 --> 01:49:53.553
TO BE. IN DETERMINING WHICH

01:49:53.620 --> 01:49:56.356
ACTIVITIES RECEIVE GRANTS AND

01:49:56.423 --> 01:49:57.958
WHICH ARE MOST APPROPRIATE FOR

01:49:58.024 --> 01:50:01.728
LOANS. SO ALL SPEAK- MAKE TWO

01:50:01.795 --> 01:50:02.963
POINTS ON THE CLIMATE CATALYST

01:50:03.029 --> 01:50:05.598
FUND- THE FIRST IS THAT TIME

01:50:05.665 --> 01:50:07.400
RIGHT NAME BY THE WAY THANK.

01:50:07.467 --> 01:50:08.668
THE FIRST IS ON THE TIGHTENING

01:50:08.735 --> 01:50:10.437
LIKE YOU MENTIONED IT'S TWO

01:50:10.503 --> 01:50:10.971
HUNDRED FIFTY NINE DOLLARS

01:50:11.037 --> 01:50:12.672
PROPOSED FOR THE BUDGET YEAR.

01:50:12.739 --> 01:50:14.207
AND THEN THE OTHER SEVEN

01:50:14.274 --> 01:50:14.808
HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS

01:50:14.874 --> 01:50:16.543
IS I BELIEVE THREE YEARS. AFTER

01:50:16.609 --> 01:50:18.178
THAT AND I THINK THE REASON WE

01:50:18.244 --> 01:50:20.580
STRUCTURED IT THAT WAY- IT WAS

01:50:20.647 --> 01:50:22.649
BECAUSE- THIS IS A BRAND NEW

01:50:22.716 --> 01:50:23.984
FIND AND WE PUT A LOT OF

01:50:24.050 --> 01:50:25.318
THOUGHT INTO IT BUT IT WILL

01:50:25.385 --> 01:50:26.720
TAKE SOME TIME AS AS WE'VE SEEN

01:50:26.786 --> 01:50:28.321
WITH THE HOMELESSNESS MONEY. TO

01:50:28.388 --> 01:50:29.923
ACTUALLY GET THOSE FINDS OUT

01:50:29.990 --> 01:50:30.957
THE DOOR SO WE CAN'T ACTUALLY

01:50:31.024 --> 01:50:33.426
SPEND- BILL OR LOAN OUT ACTION

01:50:33.493 --> 01:50:34.861
SAY SPEND ALONE OUT OF BILLION

01:50:34.928 --> 01:50:36.363
DOLLARS IN THE FIRST OR EVEN

01:50:36.429 --> 01:50:37.964
THE FIRST TWO YEARS. OF THE

01:50:38.031 --> 01:50:38.965
PROGRAM SO THE WAY THAT IT'S

01:50:39.032 --> 01:50:40.467
STRUCTURED RIGHT NOW WITH TWO

01:50:40.533 --> 01:50:41.534
FIFTY UP FRONT AND CENTER FIFTY

01:50:41.601 --> 01:50:43.470
WAITER. SHOULDN'T REALLY IMPEDE

01:50:43.536 --> 01:50:44.371
THE ACTIVITIES OF THE NEW

01:50:44.437 --> 01:50:46.940
ENTITY IN ANY SIGNIFICANT WAY-

01:50:47.007 --> 01:50:47.741
AND THEN TO THE COMMITMENT

01:50:47.807 --> 01:50:50.110
POINT A WEEK TO HOLD IN THE-

01:50:50.176 --> 01:50:51.411
MULTI YEAR PROJECTIONS OF THIS

01:50:51.478 --> 01:50:53.213
OF COURSE IS THE CHART THAT-

01:50:53.279 --> 01:50:54.981
GOES THE NEXT THREE YEARS. WE

01:50:55.048 --> 01:50:56.082
DO HOLD SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY

01:50:56.149 --> 01:50:57.917
MILLION DOLLARS IN EXPENDITURES

01:50:57.984 --> 01:50:59.819
FOR THAT OUT YEAR. GRANTED AT

01:50:59.886 --> 01:51:02.288
YOUR POINT WE COULD BE IN A

01:51:02.355 --> 01:51:03.189
RECESSION AT YOU KNOW ANY SORT

01:51:03.256 --> 01:51:03.723
OF THING COULD HAPPEN BUT-

01:51:03.790 --> 01:51:04.624
ACCORDING TO OUR CURRENT

01:51:04.691 --> 01:51:06.026
SPENDING PLAN. YOUR ACCOUNT FOR

01:51:06.092 --> 01:51:09.362
THAT AND DECIDE THIS IS- THAT

01:51:09.429 --> 01:51:17.604
SEVEN FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IS.

01:51:17.670 --> 01:51:19.305
WHEN YOU FROM. BUDGET NOT. THIS

01:51:19.372 --> 01:51:19.939
BUDGET YEAR BUT IT IS. SO WHEN

WE TO ARE A- MULTI YEAR X. A

01:51:21.908 --> 01:51:22.876
REVENUE IN THAT OUT YEAR AN-

01:51:22.942 --> 01:51:23.510
PROJECT. HOW MUCH WORKING SPEND

01:51:23.576 --> 01:51:25.378
IN. YEAR WE ARE SAYING- THE

01:51:25.445 --> 01:51:26.746
EXPENDITURE FOR THAT YEAR AND

01:51:26.813 --> 01:51:27.814
YOU KNOW WE'RE ALWAYS THINKING

01:51:27.881 --> 01:51:28.782
WE NEED TO HAVE AN OPERATING

01:51:28.848 --> 01:51:30.750
SURPLUS IN THAT YEAR- THAT

01:51:30.817 --> 01:51:32.218
SURPLUS NEEDS TO BE AFTER.

01:51:32.285 --> 01:51:34.154
SPENDING SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY

01:51:34.220 --> 01:51:35.321
NINE DOLLARS IN THAT YEAR SO.

01:51:35.388 --> 01:51:37.290
IT IS IN OUR SYSTEM IT IS PART

01:51:37.357 --> 01:51:39.125
OF OUR SPENDING PLAN. AND YOUR

01:51:39.192 --> 01:51:40.960
POINT IF. IT IS TRUE THAT UNTIL

01:51:41.027 --> 01:51:42.095
IT'S ACTUALLY ENACTED BY THE

01:51:42.162 --> 01:51:43.730
LEGISLATURE IN THAT YEAR. HE

01:51:43.797 --> 01:51:45.298
DOESN'T ACTUALLY GO OUT BUT

01:51:45.365 --> 01:51:46.566
IT'S CERTAINLY PART OF OUR PLAN

01:51:46.633 --> 01:51:48.735
AND OUR PROJECTIONS- AND THEN

01:51:48.802 --> 01:51:50.637
WHEN IT COMES TO BE AT. THE

01:51:50.703 --> 01:51:52.038
ACTUAL OPERATION WERE

01:51:52.105 --> 01:51:53.840
ENVISIONING THIS. WITHIN THE-

01:51:53.907 --> 01:51:56.543
INFRASTRUCTURE BANK- BUT ALSO

01:51:56.609 --> 01:51:58.111
THE STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL.

01:51:58.178 --> 01:51:59.679
AND LABOR AGENCY PLAYING A

01:51:59.746 --> 01:52:02.215
ROLE. AND YOU WILL YOU KNOW AS

01:52:02.282 --> 01:52:02.982
WE PUT OUT OUR TRAILER BILL

01:52:03.049 --> 01:52:04.184
LANGUAGE AND ADDITIONAL

01:52:04.250 --> 01:52:05.485
DETAILS. WE'LL BE SHARING SOME

01:52:05.552 --> 01:52:06.753
OF THE KEY AREAS AND OF COURSE

01:52:06.820 --> 01:52:07.954
THE LEGISLATURE WILL HAVE AN

01:52:08.021 --> 01:52:09.656
OPPORTUNITY TO WEIGH IN. ON

01:52:09.722 --> 01:52:10.690
WHETHER THE PRIORITIES OF THE

01:52:10.757 --> 01:52:11.691
GOVERNOR BELIEVES ARE MOST

01:52:11.758 --> 01:52:13.259
IMPORTANT FOR THIS FIND. ARE

I ARE THESE. I WOULD IS THE

01:58:55.261 --> 01:58:56.596
ONLY AS- IS SOMETHING THAT THAT

01:58:56.662 --> 01:58:57.230
THAT THE GOVERNOR'S

01:58:57.296 --> 01:58:59.131

01:58:59.198 --> 01:59:01.334
REVIEWING OR- OR A THAT ALL

01:59:01.400 --> 01:59:02.702
THOSE ON THE TABLE. YEAH SO

01:59:02.768 --> 01:59:04.103
ALL- I'LL SEE TWO POINTS ENDING

01:59:04.170 --> 01:59:05.071
NUMBER ONE WE'RE DEFINITELY

01:59:05.137 --> 01:59:07.139
LOOKING AT. ALL THE DIFFERENT-

01:59:07.206 --> 01:59:08.207
SUGGESTIONS AND PROPOSALS ON

01:59:08.274 --> 01:59:10.710
THE TABLE AND- WE'VE- MADE SOME

01:59:10.776 --> 01:59:11.511
OF THOSE CHANGES IN OUR

01:59:11.577 --> 01:59:13.079
PROJECTIONS- THAT THE ONLY A

01:59:13.145 --> 01:59:14.614
MENTION IN TERMS OF. POWER

01:59:14.680 --> 01:59:16.382
FUNDING FACILITIES- OUT OF THIS

01:59:16.449 --> 01:59:17.750
FINE DINO BOTH IN TERMS OF. HOW

01:59:17.817 --> 01:59:19.986
MANY AND THE TIMING. UP SO WE

01:59:20.052 --> 01:59:20.987
ARE VERY FOCUSED ON THOSE

01:59:21.053 --> 01:59:22.221
OPTIONS AND WILL CONTINUE TO

01:59:22.288 --> 01:59:24.023
BE. AND THEN SECOND IN TERMS OF

01:59:24.090 --> 01:59:25.324
FOR SESSION AND- THAT WOULD

01:59:25.391 --> 01:59:26.926
DEFINITELY AFFECTS. BOTH THE

01:59:26.993 --> 01:59:28.895
GENERAL FUND AND OTHER FUNDS-

01:59:28.961 --> 01:59:30.830
I'LL SAY GENERALLY THAT THE AND

01:59:30.897 --> 01:59:33.199
THE A- IS- MAYBE THAT REVENUE

01:59:33.266 --> 01:59:34.400
SOURCES A LITTLE BIT MORE.

01:59:34.467 --> 01:59:35.768
STABLE IN AS PEOPLE MIGHT NOT

01:59:35.835 --> 01:59:37.537
BE BUYING AS YOU KNOW NEW CARS

01:59:37.603 --> 01:59:38.471
THAT THEY WOULD BANKS IT'S NOT

01:59:38.538 --> 01:59:39.505
LIKE THEY'RE SUDDENLY SELLING

01:59:39.572 --> 01:59:41.073
CARS YOU KNOW IT'S NOT LIKE THE

01:59:41.140 --> 01:59:42.275
WAY THAT ALCOHOL MAY DROP OR

01:59:42.341 --> 01:59:43.776
CERTAINLY. THE VALUE OF IN

01:59:43.843 --> 01:59:44.844
INCOME OR CAPITAL GAINS MAY

01:59:44.911 --> 01:59:46.646
DROP- BUT CERTAINLY IN A

01:59:46.712 --> 01:59:48.548
RECESSION ENVIRONMENT THERE

01:59:48.614 --> 01:59:49.215
WOULD BE ADDITIONAL PRESSURE ON

01:59:49.282 --> 01:59:55.288
THIS FUN LIKE OTHERS. OF I

01:59:55.354 --> 01:59:56.322

01:59:56.389 --> 01:59:57.623
COME AS I AND I THINK THAT IT'S

01:59:57.690 --> 01:59:58.224

01:59:58.291 --> 01:59:59.458
WE'RE NOT REALLY PAYING A LOT

01:59:59.525 --> 02:00:00.760
OF ATTENTION TO IT AND I THINK

02:00:00.826 --> 02:00:02.161
BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE

02:00:02.228 --> 02:00:02.695

SOMEPLACE WHERE- WITH IT BEING

02:04:11.577 --> 02:04:13.712
TAKEN CARE OF IN. THE BUT

02:04:13.779 --> 02:04:17.049
THEY'RE ON- THEIR MEDICINE. IT

02:04:17.116 --> 02:04:19.018

IN THE TRADITIONAL MEDICARE

02:04:48.447 --> 02:04:50.249
PROGRAMS. EVEN IN OUR PROP

02:04:50.316 --> 02:04:50.816
NINETY EIGHT SCHOOLS BUDGET

02:04:50.883 --> 02:04:52.051
THERE'S MONEY THESE CAN BE

02:04:52.117 --> 02:04:54.186
SCHOOLS FOR MENTAL HEALTH- BUT

02:04:54.253 --> 02:04:56.121

AS AN ADDITION. OUT OF TO THAT

02:05:05.297 --> 02:05:06.899
WHERE AN ADULT ALWAYS. YOU CALL

02:05:06.966 --> 02:05:08.234
THAT COUNTY THAT HELL

02:05:08.300 --> 02:05:10.135
CALIFORNIA FOR ALL ITS THIS YOU

02:05:10.202 --> 02:05:11.670
KNOW THAT. A CHANCE PROPOSAL

02:05:11.737 --> 02:05:14.773

HEALTH SERVICES ACT. ARE

02:06:06.992 --> 02:06:07.860
EXACTLY THE KINDS OF THINGS YOU

02:06:07.927 --> 02:06:09.161
TALKED ABOUT WITH REGARD TO

02:06:09.228 --> 02:06:11.096
MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE- WHO ARE

02:06:11.163 --> 02:06:12.164
EXPERIENCING MENTAL HEALTH

02:06:12.231 --> 02:06:13.265
CHALLENGES BUT ALSO

02:06:13.332 --> 02:06:14.199
HOMELESSNESS ARE ALSO OTHER

02:06:14.266 --> 02:06:16.001
CHALLENGES. WERE TAKING A WHOLE

02:06:16.068 --> 02:06:17.870
PERSON APPROACH TO ALL OF THIS-

02:06:17.937 --> 02:06:19.138
AND THEN FINALLY ON THE SECOND

02:06:19.204 --> 02:06:20.205
POINT THAT YOU RAISE WHICH IS

02:06:20.272 --> 02:06:22.474
REGARD THAT CONSERVATORSHIP-

02:06:22.541 --> 02:06:23.375
YOU MAY HAVE SEEN THAT THE

02:06:23.442 --> 02:06:24.410
GOVERNOR MADE SOME COMMENTS

02:06:24.476 --> 02:06:25.744
ABOUT THIS AT HIS PRESS.

02:06:25.811 --> 02:06:27.379
CONFERENCE I DON'T HAVE ANY

02:06:27.446 --> 02:06:29.715
DETAILS TO SHARE BEYOND THAT-

02:06:29.782 --> 02:06:31.483
BUT THIS IS CERTAINLY AN AREA

02:06:31.550 --> 02:06:33.285
IDEA ANY YEAH UPDATES TO THE

02:06:33.352 --> 02:06:34.620
WINTER WOULD BE TOO SHORT ACT.

02:06:34.687 --> 02:06:35.888
OF THAT HE'S LOOKING AT.

02:06:35.955 --> 02:06:37.289
ANOTHER WILL PUT THE VOTERS

02:06:37.356 --> 02:06:38.691
LIKE THEY'RE TALKING BUT IN THE

02:06:38.757 --> 02:06:39.625
ISSUE BUT I THINK LEGISLATION

02:06:39.692 --> 02:06:44.496
TO TAKE CONTROL OF THAT- WITH

02:06:44.563 --> 02:06:47.199
THE BIG THIS. BIG ISSUE I DID A

02:06:47.266 --> 02:06:48.801
COUPLE WORKPLACE ON. THE ON THE

02:06:48.867 --> 02:06:50.836
CANON CONSULTING. GREAT THIS

02:06:50.903 --> 02:06:53.138
NOT HAVE A SILO- THE ONLY THING

02:06:53.205 --> 02:06:54.340
IS THE SIM WE'VE BEEN-

02:06:54.406 --> 02:06:55.674
PRIORITIZE ENFORCEMENT FOR

02:06:55.741 --> 02:06:57.142
NUMBER OF YEARS. AND WILL

02:06:57.209 --> 02:06:59.445
CONTINUE TO DO THIS- ON PAGE

02:06:59.511 --> 02:07:00.012
ONE SEVEN ON THE GOVERNOR'S

02:07:00.079 --> 02:07:01.747
BUDGET SUMMARY. ENFORCEMENT'S

02:07:01.814 --> 02:07:05.184
MISSION ONCE. SO THAT'S WHAT

02:07:05.250 --> 02:07:07.586
THE FORCE TO LOOK LIKE THAT IS

02:07:07.653 --> 02:07:09.288
VERY VAGUE. SO I'LL TURN OVER

02:07:09.355 --> 02:07:11.256

02:07:11.323 --> 02:07:13.525
CHERYL MORE IN TERMS OF POWER

02:07:13.592 --> 02:07:14.159
THINKING ABOUT ENFORCEMENT THIS

02:07:14.226 --> 02:07:17.663
YEAR. IT WILL CLOSE COMING UP.

02:07:17.730 --> 02:07:18.464
I WAS LIKE A LOT OF THINGS

02:07:18.530 --> 02:07:19.965
FINANCES JUL DOWN ON AND THEN

02:07:20.032 --> 02:07:22.201
SOMETHING'S JUST VERY. VERY

02:07:22.267 --> 02:07:25.137
VERY VERY OPAQUE. THANK YOUNG

02:07:25.204 --> 02:07:27.439
APARTMENT AFINANCE SO I THINK-

02:07:27.506 --> 02:07:30.042
THE CONSOLIDATION- IS ONE OF

02:07:30.109 --> 02:07:31.043
THOSE PROPOSALS WHERE WE HAVE

02:07:31.110 --> 02:07:33.145
MORE DEAL DETAILS FORTHCOMING

02:07:33.212 --> 02:07:35.381
IN THE SPRING- AND- THE

02:07:35.447 --> 02:07:36.482
GOVERNOR AGREES THAT

02:07:36.548 --> 02:07:37.683
ENFORCEMENT IS ON COURSE

02:07:37.750 --> 02:07:39.985
IMPORTANT ASPECT OF MAKING-

02:07:40.052 --> 02:07:41.387
FUNCTIONAL CANNABIS MARKET AND

02:07:41.453 --> 02:07:42.354
SO WE'RE GONNA LOOK INTO THAT

02:07:42.421 --> 02:07:43.922
AS WE GO INTO THAT

02:07:43.989 --> 02:07:46.058
CONSOLIDATION EFFORT- I WOULD

02:07:46.125 --> 02:07:48.093
ALSO POINT OUT THAT- THEY

02:07:48.160 --> 02:07:50.863
CANNABIS TAX FUND- DOES PROVIDE

02:07:50.929 --> 02:07:51.964
MONEY TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH

02:07:52.031 --> 02:07:53.432
AND WILDLIFE DEPARTMENT. OF

02:07:53.499 --> 02:07:56.702
PARKS AND RECREATION AND

02:07:56.769 --> 02:07:58.037
THERE'S ADDITIONAL MONEY THAT

02:07:58.103 --> 02:07:59.438
GOES TO THE BOARD OF COMMUNITY

02:07:59.505 --> 02:08:01.607
STATE AND COMMUNITY

02:08:01.673 --> 02:08:04.443
CORRECTIONS- AND THOSE MONIES

02:08:04.510 --> 02:08:05.444
CAN ALSO GO TO LOCAL

02:08:05.511 --> 02:08:06.812
GOVERNMENTS FOR YOUTH

02:08:06.879 --> 02:08:08.447
INTERVENTION AND ENFORCEMENT SO

02:08:08.514 --> 02:08:09.281
THOSE ARE SOME OF THE

02:08:09.348 --> 02:08:10.783
CATEGORIES THAT ARE GROWING

02:08:10.849 --> 02:08:11.984
YEAR AFTER YEAR. BUT THOSE

02:08:12.051 --> 02:08:12.985
CATEGORIES RIGHT NOW DEALING

02:08:13.052 --> 02:08:15.220
WITH AP AND MOST OF IT BEING

02:08:15.287 --> 02:08:16.822
INCIDENTS HAVE COME BECAUSE OF

02:08:16.889 --> 02:08:19.491
THE BLACK MARKET- CANNABIS. SO

02:08:19.558 --> 02:08:21.827
THE AGENCIES YOU JUST MENTIONED

02:08:21.894 --> 02:08:22.461
AND NONE OF THEM DEAL WITH THE

02:08:22.528 --> 02:08:24.930
BLACK MARKET. VAPING ISSUE SO

02:08:24.997 --> 02:08:26.298
THOSE ARE GREAT BUT THEY'RE ALL

02:08:26.365 --> 02:08:27.866
SEPARATE THINGS THAT REALLY

02:08:27.933 --> 02:08:29.435
DON'T GO THROUGH THE PROBLEM.

02:08:29.501 --> 02:08:30.869
WE ALSO NATIONWIDE EPIDEMIC

02:08:30.936 --> 02:08:32.538
GOVERNOR'S COME OUT SPOKE

02:08:32.604 --> 02:08:34.673
PUBLICLY ABOUT IT DOT THE VP.

02:08:34.740 --> 02:08:37.176
BUT YET THAT'S A BIG PRIORITY

02:08:37.242 --> 02:08:39.678
FOR THE BLACK MARKET. WE STILL

02:08:39.745 --> 02:08:40.546
GOT A DEAL THAT IN THAT

02:08:40.612 --> 02:08:41.680
OTHERWISE THERE IS NOTHING TO

02:08:41.747 --> 02:08:43.882
DO WITH THE VAPING. EMPTY WRONG

02:08:43.949 --> 02:08:46.018
ABOUT CORRECT ON THAT FACT. YES

02:08:46.085 --> 02:08:48.053
THIS WILDLIFE. NOT A NOTHING

02:08:48.120 --> 02:08:54.493
WITH THAT SO. SO. I THINK. THAT

02:08:54.560 --> 02:08:55.594
THERE IS AS FAR AS PART THE

02:08:55.661 --> 02:08:56.462
CONSOLE. EFFORT THINKING WE ARE

02:08:56.528 --> 02:08:57.796
TRYING TO. FOR LOOK AT

02:08:57.863 --> 02:08:59.798
ENFORCEMENT AND WHAT WE CAN DO

02:08:59.865 --> 02:09:00.766
IN THAT SPACE AND I'M

02:09:00.833 --> 02:09:03.235
CERTAINLY- BLACK MARKET VAPING

02:09:03.302 --> 02:09:03.869
PRODUCTS WILL BE A

02:09:03.936 --> 02:09:06.138
CONSIDERATION AND NOT ANALYSIS

02:09:06.205 --> 02:09:07.573
SO THE BIG THING A LOT HERE

02:09:07.639 --> 02:09:09.408
LUCKILY BODY BUT- WITH THE WITH

02:09:09.475 --> 02:09:10.909
THE- DEPARTMENT JUSTICE ARE

02:09:10.976 --> 02:09:13.345
BEHIND. A DESTINATION IN GAMING

02:09:13.412 --> 02:09:15.614
THE STATE. DOESN'T PAY THAT

02:09:15.681 --> 02:09:17.449
WELL SO THEY HAVE A RECRUITMENT

02:09:17.516 --> 02:09:21.320
RETENTION PROBLEM. SO TO LOOK

02:09:21.386 --> 02:09:21.920
AT THE STATE IS BEING ABLE TO

02:09:21.987 --> 02:09:22.955
HANDLE IT. BY THEMSELVES IT

02:09:23.021 --> 02:09:24.323
JUST DOESN'T HAPPEN REALLY

02:09:24.389 --> 02:09:25.791
DEPEND UPON LOCALS TO DOODLES

02:09:25.858 --> 02:09:28.227
ISSUES. A HAD THE BIG BUST IN

02:09:28.293 --> 02:09:30.262
LA WITH THAT ONE COMPANY WAS.

02:09:30.329 --> 02:09:31.196
ONE FOR THE BLACK MARKET ONE

02:09:31.263 --> 02:09:33.098
FOOT IN THE IN THE- PUBLIC

02:09:33.165 --> 02:09:34.700
MARKET IN THEY RELIED HEAVILY

02:09:34.766 --> 02:09:36.535
UPON LOCALS. TO DO THAT BECAUSE

02:09:36.602 --> 02:09:37.836
THE EXPERTISE HAS GONE UP IN

02:09:37.903 --> 02:09:40.506
THE STATE. WHEN GOVERNOR BROWN-

02:09:40.572 --> 02:09:41.773
DE FUNDED OTHER BUREAU OF

02:09:41.840 --> 02:09:42.474
NARCOTIC ENFORCEMENT THE

02:09:42.541 --> 02:09:44.076
DEPARTMENT JUSTICE SO YOU DON'T

02:09:44.143 --> 02:09:45.711
HAVE THE EXPERTISE THERE. IN

02:09:45.777 --> 02:09:46.678
THE STATE TO DEAL WITH THESE

02:09:46.745 --> 02:09:49.081
ISSUES SO DESPERATE WE TRY TO

02:09:49.148 --> 02:09:50.582
FIGURE OUT HOW. HOW THAT WORKS

02:09:50.649 --> 02:09:52.451
ENFORCEMENT PART LIKE I SAID.

02:09:52.518 --> 02:09:54.386
ALL THIS IS JUST ONE SINCE IT'S

02:09:54.453 --> 02:09:55.787

02:09:55.854 --> 02:09:59.391
THE- SECOND SINCE THAT'S A

02:09:59.458 --> 02:10:00.392
GREAT CONCERN FOR ME ABOUT THAT.

02:10:00.459 --> 02:10:01.393
YOU KNOW HOW DO WE GET THERE.

02:10:01.460 --> 02:10:03.128
IF THE ADMINISTRATION SAYS

02:10:03.195 --> 02:10:04.096
VAPING IS AN ISSUE WE WANT TO.

02:10:04.163 --> 02:10:05.130
WE WANT TO DEAL WITH ILLICIT

02:10:05.197 --> 02:10:07.099

02:10:07.166 --> 02:10:09.001
BE HONEST WITH YOU I HAVE ONE

02:10:09.067 --> 02:10:10.536

THERE'S REALLY NO. YOU KNOW

02:10:15.107 --> 02:10:16.508
WHAT TO SPEND TWO YEARS NOW

ALSO FOLKS WANT TO COME IN. AND

02:10:19.077 --> 02:10:20.979
GET A LICENSE OR- DO THAT.

02:10:21.046 --> 02:10:22.181
THERE'S THE AMPLE TIME. POINT

02:10:22.247 --> 02:10:23.415
THIS US TO DROP YOU GOT A

02:10:23.482 --> 02:10:25.918
BUILDING FULL. THEY'RE HARMING

POINT SEVEN MILLION IN NINETEEN

02:10:40.866 --> 02:10:42.434
TWENTY GROWING TO FORTY FOUR

02:10:42.501 --> 02:10:43.368
POINT EIGHT MILLION IN TWENTY

02:10:43.435 --> 02:10:45.871
TWENTY ONE. SOME MONEY IS FOR

02:10:45.938 --> 02:10:47.539
JURISDICTIONS THAT HAVE ALLOWED

02:10:47.606 --> 02:10:49.708
FOR. LEGAL ACCESS THROUGH

02:10:49.775 --> 02:10:51.176
RETAILING CULTIVATION CAN

02:10:51.243 --> 02:10:52.511
RECEIVE SOME OF THOSE MONIES

02:10:52.578 --> 02:10:53.779
AND SOME OF THAT CAN GO TO

02:10:53.845 --> 02:10:54.980
PUBLIC SEE WHAT THE ACTIVITY IS

02:10:55.047 --> 02:10:57.916
KEEPING IT ON THAT THE MAJORITY

02:10:57.983 --> 02:10:58.450
OF JURISDICTIONS HAVE NOT

02:10:58.517 --> 02:11:00.819
ALLOWED. CORRECT CORRECT SO THE

02:11:00.886 --> 02:11:01.887
JURY AT MOODY'S GO TO CHURCHES

02:11:01.954 --> 02:11:03.222
THAT ALLOW IT SO THE MAJORITY

02:11:03.288 --> 02:11:05.123
OF CALIFORNIANS. WHERE THEY

02:11:05.190 --> 02:11:07.125
LIVE OR NOT GETTING THOSE

02:11:07.192 --> 02:11:10.462
RESOURCES. SO IT'S IS THE STICK

02:11:10.529 --> 02:11:11.763
ON THAT AND THAT'S THAT'S THE

02:11:11.830 --> 02:11:12.931
BIG ISSUE OF THEIR THEIR WAYS

02:11:12.998 --> 02:11:15.968
TO GET IT BUT- STILL IT DOESN'T

02:11:16.034 --> 02:11:16.535
DEAL WITH THE ROOT CAUSE THE

02:11:16.602 --> 02:11:18.837
PROBLEM. SURE AND ADD THAT'S A

02:11:18.904 --> 02:11:20.072
CONSTRAINT THAT WAS PUT IN

02:11:20.138 --> 02:11:22.574
PLACE IN PROP SIXTY FOUR- THAT

02:11:22.641 --> 02:11:24.309
THE VOTERS APPROVED IN SO THAT

02:11:24.376 --> 02:11:25.711
WERE MOVING THE- PROGRAM ALONG

02:11:25.777 --> 02:11:28.113
WITH AS THE- INCENTIVE FOR

02:11:28.180 --> 02:11:29.548
JURISDICTIONS OBVIOUSLY I

02:11:29.615 --> 02:11:30.549
ASSUME THAT WAS THE INTENT

02:11:30.616 --> 02:11:32.684
BEHIND- THAT PROVISION. IN

02:11:32.751 --> 02:11:34.186
THERE RIGHT IT'S ALSO TALKED

02:11:34.253 --> 02:11:35.287
ABOUT LOCAL CONTROL LOCALS

02:11:35.354 --> 02:11:37.122
MAINTAINING LOCAL CONTROL TO.

02:11:37.189 --> 02:11:38.457
SO I MEAN THERE'S THINGS ON

02:11:38.523 --> 02:11:39.591
THAT BUT THAT'S JUST SO WE KNOW

02:11:39.658 --> 02:11:41.260
WE CAN WE CAN FOCUS ON THAT.

02:11:41.326 --> 02:11:42.261
THAT THAT IS THAT IS A BIG

02:11:42.327 --> 02:11:44.696
ISSUE. AND THEN I JUST HAD ONE

02:11:44.763 --> 02:11:53.038
MORE. ISSUE TALK ABOUT. THAT.

02:11:53.105 --> 02:11:53.972
ON THE ON THE PROBATION ANOTHER

02:11:54.039 --> 02:11:55.540
GOVERNOR- WANTS TO GO REDUCE

02:11:55.607 --> 02:11:57.776
PROBATION FROM FROM FIVE YEARS

02:11:57.843 --> 02:11:59.845
TO THREE YEARS ON FELONIES AND

02:11:59.911 --> 02:12:01.146
ALLOW THE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT

02:12:01.213 --> 02:12:02.981
I THINK FOR SOMETHING'S FOR NON

02:12:03.048 --> 02:12:04.316
VIOLENT CRIMES ARE PROPERTY

02:12:04.383 --> 02:12:06.451
CLAIMS YEAH I GET THAT THE ONLY

02:12:06.518 --> 02:12:09.988
ISSUE IS. UNDER FELONIES YOU'RE

02:12:10.055 --> 02:12:11.690
TALKING ABOUT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

02:12:11.757 --> 02:12:12.991
CHILD NEGLECT SO YOU CAN

02:12:13.058 --> 02:12:14.092
ACTUALLY HAVE SOMEBODY THAT HAS

02:12:14.159 --> 02:12:16.094
MULTIPLE CONVICTIONS FOR

02:12:16.161 --> 02:12:17.896
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. IN FOR CHILD

02:12:17.963 --> 02:12:21.833
NEGLECT SO IF SOMEONE GOT UP

02:12:21.900 --> 02:12:23.669
PAST PATTERNS OF THOSE

02:12:23.735 --> 02:12:25.070
PRACTICES THEY'RE THEY'RE

02:12:25.137 --> 02:12:25.604
PRETTY SUBSTANTIAL PRETTY

02:12:25.671 --> 02:12:28.307
SEVERE. DO WE WANT THAT PERSON

02:12:28.373 --> 02:12:30.175
OFF OF PROBATION OR DO YOU WANT

02:12:30.242 --> 02:12:31.343
TO MONITOR THAT BECAUSE IT IS

02:12:31.410 --> 02:12:32.678
DIFFERENT I MEAN ALL

02:12:32.744 --> 02:12:33.779
MISDEMEANORS AT BIG DEAL FOR

02:12:33.845 --> 02:12:35.414
TIME DO YOU LIVE MAYBE

02:12:35.480 --> 02:12:36.815
SOMEONE'S GOING ON I GUESS THE

02:12:36.882 --> 02:12:38.984
PERSON IS LIKE A BURGLAR. BUT

02:12:39.051 --> 02:12:41.420
AT SOME POINT YOU KNOW IT CAN

02:12:41.486 --> 02:12:43.322
BE A ONE COOKIE CUTTER SIZE

02:12:43.388 --> 02:12:44.890
FITS ALL I DON'T BELIEVE THAT

02:12:44.956 --> 02:12:46.491
WAS GOVERNOR'S INTENT FOR

02:12:46.558 --> 02:12:47.459
THOUGH IS CHILDREN HE'S VERY

02:12:47.526 --> 02:12:50.262
CONCERNED ABOUT- WOMEN AND

02:12:50.329 --> 02:12:50.829
CHILDREN AND SPOUSES WITHOUT

02:12:50.896 --> 02:12:54.433
SO. COULD HAVE BEEN VERY IT WAS

02:12:54.499 --> 02:12:55.701
VERY VAGUE. AND IT IS THE

02:12:55.767 --> 02:12:57.269
INTENT TO DRILL DOWN ON THAT

02:12:57.336 --> 02:12:59.404
AND TO. EXCLUDE THINGS BECAUSE

02:12:59.471 --> 02:13:00.005
AS WE'VE SEEN IN THE PAST OF

02:13:00.072 --> 02:13:02.007
SOME OF THESE COLONEL JUSTICE

02:13:02.074 --> 02:13:04.976
REFORMS- WE MADE MISTAKES WITH

02:13:05.043 --> 02:13:07.245
THIS SO. I GUESS I WOULD LIKE

02:13:07.312 --> 02:13:08.947
TO SEE. THE ADMINISTRATION GET

02:13:09.014 --> 02:13:10.515
RIGHT THE FIRST TIME SO. WHAT

02:13:10.582 --> 02:13:11.817
WAS WHAT THE PLAN ON THAT TO

02:13:11.883 --> 02:13:13.452
DRILL DOWN MORE INSULIN THAT'S

02:13:13.518 --> 02:13:15.087
THE QUESTION. SURE I'LL MAKE

02:13:15.153 --> 02:13:16.288
TWO POINTS INADEQUATE CAN

02:13:16.355 --> 02:13:17.989
OPERATE IN THE FIRST DAYS AT A

02:13:18.056 --> 02:13:20.225
PROPOSAL- GOVERNOR OF LOOKING

02:13:20.292 --> 02:13:22.728
AT- EVIDENCE THAT SHE SUGGESTS

02:13:22.794 --> 02:13:24.363
THAT- FOR BETTER OR WORSE YOU

02:13:24.429 --> 02:13:25.964
KNOW WE REALLY GET A SENSE OF

02:13:26.031 --> 02:13:27.265
THE FIRST TWO YEARS OUT. HOW

02:13:27.332 --> 02:13:28.700
SOMEONE ON PROBATION YOU KNOW

02:13:28.767 --> 02:13:30.402
WHAT WILL HAPPEN NEXT BUT MORE

02:13:30.469 --> 02:13:31.570
IMPORTANT AND THAT THE SECOND

02:13:31.636 --> 02:13:34.039
POINT IS THAT. THE PROPOSAL'S

02:13:34.106 --> 02:13:35.841
COUPLED WITH SIXTY MILLION

02:13:35.907 --> 02:13:37.242
DOLLARS IN FUNDING. IN OUR

02:13:37.309 --> 02:13:38.377
BUDGET SO IT'S NOT SIMPLY.

02:13:38.443 --> 02:13:40.245
LOOKING AT THAT AND- SAY THAT

02:13:40.312 --> 02:13:41.113
PROBATION TERM DOESN'T HAVE TO

02:13:41.179 --> 02:13:42.781
BE THIS LONG. IT'S LET'S MAKE

02:13:42.848 --> 02:13:44.282
IT TWO YEARS BUT WHAT'S REALLY

02:13:44.349 --> 02:13:46.651
FOCUS ON THOSE TWO YEARS WITH.

02:13:46.718 --> 02:13:47.252
SIXTY NINE DOLLARS AND THIS IS

02:13:47.319 --> 02:13:48.220
NOT ONLY IN THE BUDGET YEAR BUT

02:13:48.286 --> 02:13:49.388
THE YEAR AFTER THAT AND THE

02:13:49.454 --> 02:13:51.690
YEAR AFTER THAT. AND HOPING AND

02:13:51.757 --> 02:13:52.924
EXPECTING THAT WITH THIS

02:13:52.991 --> 02:13:54.493
ADDITIONAL- SIXTY MILLION

02:13:54.559 --> 02:13:55.694
DOLLARS OF SERVICES VERY

02:13:55.761 --> 02:13:57.696
INTENSIVE. IN FOCUSED IN THOSE

02:13:57.763 --> 02:13:58.597
FIRST TWO YEARS WILL ACTUALLY

02:13:58.663 --> 02:14:00.198
GET MUCH BETTER OUTCOMES AND

02:14:00.265 --> 02:14:02.267
THEN. WHEN I WON THE LOTTERY. I

02:14:02.334 --> 02:14:03.568
THE ONLY OTHER POINT I WOULD

02:14:03.635 --> 02:14:06.371
MAKE IS THAT- AS WITH A POINTED

02:14:06.438 --> 02:14:08.340
OUT THAT AND MUCH OF THE

02:14:08.407 --> 02:14:09.875
RECIDIVISM HAPPENS WITHIN THOSE

02:14:09.941 --> 02:14:11.510
FIRST TWO YEARS AND THE POINT

02:14:11.576 --> 02:14:13.712
HERE IS TO FOCUS SERVICES AN

02:14:13.779 --> 02:14:15.614
INTERVENTION. AND ALLOW FOR AND

02:14:15.680 --> 02:14:17.015
EARNED DISCHARGE PROCESS. IT

02:14:17.082 --> 02:14:18.383
CREATE INCENTIVES FOR

02:14:18.450 --> 02:14:19.584
INDIVIDUALS TO MAKE THOSE

02:14:19.651 --> 02:14:21.887
POSITIVE BEING- MODIFICATIONS.

02:14:21.953 --> 02:14:24.089
AND WE'RE ALSO- HOPEFUL THAT

02:14:24.156 --> 02:14:25.424
THE PROBATION DEPARTMENT

02:14:25.490 --> 02:14:27.959
CONTINUE THEIR EFFORT TO USE

02:14:28.026 --> 02:14:30.162
RISK IN NEED ASSESSMENTS. TO

02:14:30.228 --> 02:14:33.832
ACTUALLY TO TURN THE LEVEL OF

02:14:33.899 --> 02:14:37.636
RISK INDIVIDUAL AS WHICH MAY BE

DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. AND CHILD

THAT. WILL THEY BE ELIGIBLE FOR

02:15:25.150 --> 02:15:27.018
THIS PROGRAM IF THEY HAD

02:15:27.085 --> 02:15:29.087
MULTIPLE VIOLATIONS TO. I MEAN

FORCED TO CONCLUDE IT'S A

02:15:47.472 --> 02:15:49.107
COOKIE CUTTER ONE SIZE FITS ALL

02:15:49.174 --> 02:15:53.078
FOR THIS. I THINK I THINK THAT

02:15:53.144 --> 02:15:55.814
THAT TO THE POINT IS THAT- AS

02:15:55.881 --> 02:15:57.382
FAR AS INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE ON

02:15:57.449 --> 02:15:59.217
SUMMARY PROBATION TODAY OUR

02:15:59.284 --> 02:16:00.785
PROPOSAL IS TO ACTUALLY

02:16:00.852 --> 02:16:02.020

THAT ARE SUPERVISED BY TO

02:16:04.389 --> 02:16:05.390
PROVIDING MONEY TO PROBATION

02:16:05.457 --> 02:16:06.925
DEPARTMENTS TO SUPERVISE

02:16:06.992 --> 02:16:07.993
CERTAIN MISDEMEANOR CRIMES I

02:16:08.059 --> 02:16:09.861
THINK DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WOULD

02:16:09.928 --> 02:16:10.862
LIKELY BE IN THAT CATEGORY BUT

02:16:10.929 --> 02:16:12.397
MORE THOSE DETAILS WILL BE

02:16:12.464 --> 02:16:14.633
RELEASED. ON FEBRUARY FIRST-

02:16:14.699 --> 02:16:17.502
BUT AND TO THAT POINT ABOUT

02:16:17.569 --> 02:16:18.870
WHETHER WE IT'LL BE IT WILL BE

02:16:18.937 --> 02:16:20.639
PICKING AND CHOOSING CRIMES ON

02:16:20.705 --> 02:16:22.140
THE FELONY SIDE AGAIN IT'S GOES

02:16:22.207 --> 02:16:24.075
BACK TO THE UNIVERSE OF MOST

02:16:24.142 --> 02:16:25.610
RECIDIVISM HAPPENS IN THE FIRST

02:16:25.677 --> 02:16:27.879
TWO YEARS- BASED ON SOMEONE'S

02:16:27.946 --> 02:16:29.881
INDIVIDUAL RISK NEEDS- AND

02:16:29.948 --> 02:16:31.516
THEIR LEVEL OF SUPERVISION WE

02:16:31.583 --> 02:16:33.118
THINK THAT THIS PROPOSAL MAKES

02:16:33.184 --> 02:16:36.121
SENSE- YEAH BROADWAY IN THAT.

02:16:36.187 --> 02:16:37.589
THAT THOSE RISK ASSESSMENTS ARE

02:16:37.656 --> 02:16:40.325
IDENTIFYING WHO NEED THAT

02:16:40.392 --> 02:16:41.359
SUPERVISION FOR THAT SHIP

02:16:41.426 --> 02:16:44.195
PERIOD OF TIME. IT DOESN'T TAKE

02:16:44.262 --> 02:16:48.700
PLACE. OKAY BUT I STILL HAVEN'T

02:16:48.767 --> 02:16:50.602

DANCING AROUND IT MAYBE I'M NOT

02:16:53.905 --> 02:16:56.274
GETTING IT BUT IS THAT YOU GUYS

02:16:56.341 --> 02:16:57.776
TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT THAT

02:16:57.842 --> 02:16:58.944
SOME OF THESE CRIMES AND THAT

02:16:59.010 --> 02:17:00.445
MIGHT DISQUALIFY THEM. FROM

02:17:00.512 --> 02:17:02.414
BEING IN THIS PROGRAM. SAID

02:17:02.480 --> 02:17:03.815
THAT THE SIMPLE ANSWER ON THE

02:17:03.882 --> 02:17:05.550
FELONY SITE IS O CARVE OUTS

02:17:05.617 --> 02:17:07.018
FOR CRIMES I WAS ONLY

02:17:07.085 --> 02:17:08.620
SPECIFYING THAT WE NOW WILL

02:17:08.687 --> 02:17:10.755
SUPERVISE CERTAIN MISDEMEANOR

02:17:10.822 --> 02:17:11.523
CRIMES IN THE CATEGORIES YOU

02:17:11.590 --> 02:17:13.692
DESCRIBED. THAT UNSUPERVISED

02:17:13.758 --> 02:17:15.560
TODAY BUT- GOING BACK TO NOT

TO. TO TYPE MORE TIME. LIST

02:17:18.363 --> 02:17:20.065
OFFICE HAVE CASES RIGHT NOW

02:17:20.131 --> 02:17:21.633
THAT ARE THIRTY OR FORTY. AND

02:17:21.700 --> 02:17:22.400
THEY DON'T GET AROUND TO SEE

02:17:22.467 --> 02:17:23.501
EVERYBODY OTHER ACTIVE

02:17:23.568 --> 02:17:25.904
CASELOADS. SO THEY AREN'T

02:17:25.971 --> 02:17:26.871
SEEING THEIR ENTIRECASE LOAD

02:17:26.938 --> 02:17:28.974
RIGHT NOW- MINIMUM SUPERVISION

02:17:29.040 --> 02:17:30.575
SO JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE- ON

02:17:30.642 --> 02:17:32.544
SUPERVISED PROBATION. IS I MEAN

02:17:32.611 --> 02:17:33.144
THIS WAS COMING AROUND ON A

02:17:33.211 --> 02:17:34.446
REGULAR BASIS JUST ONCE IN

02:17:34.512 --> 02:17:35.747
AWHILE. BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE

02:17:35.814 --> 02:17:37.115
THE STAFF IF. YOU CAN GIVE THEM

02:17:37.182 --> 02:17:38.783
MORE MONEY. BUT THE AT THAT IS

02:17:38.850 --> 02:17:40.619
AN INCREASE OUR STAFFING. SO

02:17:40.685 --> 02:17:41.486
THAT YOU ONLY HAVE SO MUCH

02:17:41.553 --> 02:17:43.521
CAPACITY TO DEAL WITH THESE

02:17:43.588 --> 02:17:44.589
INDIVIDUALS SO. THAT THAT

02:17:44.656 --> 02:17:45.690
DOESN'T CHANGE SO I MEAN I

02:17:45.757 --> 02:17:50.061
WOULD WORK WITH YOU GUYS- I

02:17:50.128 --> 02:17:50.629

BUT- I SAID IT IT'S THE IMPACT.

02:17:52.931 --> 02:17:55.533

ALL YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN UP HERE.

02:18:40.045 --> 02:18:42.247
VERY VERY DIFFICULT EXCEPT IN

02:18:42.313 --> 02:18:44.416
THAT COMPETITION THE

02:18:44.482 --> 02:18:45.984
CONTESTANTS DISSIPATE NOT THE

02:18:46.051 --> 02:18:47.952
JUDGES AND SEEMS LIKE WE'VE

02:18:48.019 --> 02:18:49.788
LOST SEVERAL JUDGES BUT NOT

02:18:49.854 --> 02:18:52.590
NONE THE LESS. MINE'S GOING TO

02:18:52.657 --> 02:18:55.193
BE SIMPLE. AND IT'S VERY A

02:18:55.260 --> 02:18:58.229
DIRECT. AND IT'S A LITTLE

02:18:58.296 --> 02:19:01.032
DISTURBING- AND THE TWENTY

02:19:01.099 --> 02:19:02.734
EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET YOUR

02:19:02.801 --> 02:19:03.268
WE FINALLY STEPPED UP WE

02:19:03.334 --> 02:19:05.303
ALLOCATED A FIVE MILLION

02:19:05.370 --> 02:19:06.471
DOLLARS IN THE GENERAL FUND IS

02:19:06.538 --> 02:19:09.007
SUPPORTER STATES EIGHTY FOUR

02:19:09.074 --> 02:19:12.644
RAPE CRISIS CENTERS- THIS YEAR

02:19:12.711 --> 02:19:15.180
THAT NUMBERS DROPPED FROM FIVE

02:19:15.246 --> 02:19:17.248
MILLION. TO FORTY FIVE THOUSAND

02:19:17.315 --> 02:19:18.650
WITH THE RECORD RECORD BUDGET

02:19:18.717 --> 02:19:19.451
YEAR THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING

02:19:19.517 --> 02:19:22.087
ABOUT. AND THE POSITIVE-

02:19:22.153 --> 02:19:25.156
ECONOMIC OUTLOOK. AND WE TALKED

02:19:25.223 --> 02:19:26.758
ABOUT CREATING TWENTY FIVE NEW

02:19:26.825 --> 02:19:30.128
DEPARTMENTS THIS YEAR. I FIND

02:19:30.195 --> 02:19:32.630
IT REALLY TROUBLING THAT- DID

02:19:32.697 --> 02:19:34.766
MINISTRATIONS CHOSEN TO DEFINE

02:19:34.833 --> 02:19:35.667
THE RAPE CRISIS CENTERS AND I

02:19:35.734 --> 02:19:37.702
KNOW YOUR YOUR ANSWER MIGHT BE

02:19:37.769 --> 02:19:39.237
THAT THERE'S AN INVESTMENT OF

02:19:39.304 --> 02:19:39.904
ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION

02:19:39.971 --> 02:19:42.741
DOLLARS. OF FOR ONGOING FUNDING

02:19:42.807 --> 02:19:44.142
TO SUPPORT THESE PROGRAMS BUT

02:19:44.209 --> 02:19:46.444
THAT'S COMING OUT OF THE- THAT

02:19:46.511 --> 02:19:47.378
WAS ALREADY A AN ADDITIONAL

02:19:47.445 --> 02:19:50.448
LINE ITEM- THAT WAS ALREADY.

02:19:50.515 --> 02:19:52.884
BAKED IN THROUGH THE PENALTY

02:19:52.951 --> 02:19:54.853
ASSESSMENT BUDGET RIGHT. IT

02:19:54.919 --> 02:19:56.287
COMES FROM THAT FUND YEAH THREE

02:19:56.354 --> 02:19:57.756
SAID USPTA STILL THAT'S A

02:19:57.822 --> 02:20:00.091
DRAMATIC REDUCTION FROM. FIVE

02:20:00.158 --> 02:20:00.625
MILLION TO ONE POINT EIGHT

02:20:00.692 --> 02:20:03.962
MILLION. NO SO I THINK OUR AT

02:20:04.028 --> 02:20:04.963
THE GENERAL APPROACHES SOME OF

02:20:05.029 --> 02:20:06.131
THE FUNDING LAST YEAR WAS ONE

02:20:06.197 --> 02:20:07.832
TIME SO THIS BUDGET BILLS IN

02:20:07.899 --> 02:20:09.000
THE ON GOING FUNDING THAT YOU

02:20:09.067 --> 02:20:10.001
MENTIONED THE ONE POINT EIGHT

02:20:10.068 --> 02:20:11.636
BUT- AT LEAST IN THE GOVERNOR'S

02:20:11.703 --> 02:20:13.738
JANUARY BUDGET THAT- BUDGET ACT

02:20:13.805 --> 02:20:14.973
LAST YEAR THE ONE TIME FUNDING

02:20:15.039 --> 02:20:16.975
WASN'T INCLUDED AGAIN IN THIS

02:20:17.041 --> 02:20:18.243
BUDGET THAT IS CORRECT. SO I

02:20:18.309 --> 02:20:25.316
GOT. THANK YOU A COUPLE

02:20:25.383 --> 02:20:31.489
QUESTIONS FROM ME SO GOING BACK

02:20:31.556 --> 02:20:32.657
TO MY COLLEAGUE MS GARCIA'S

02:20:32.724 --> 02:20:34.359
COMMENT ON THE CAP AND TRADE

02:20:34.425 --> 02:20:36.795
BUDGET WE HAD SOME DISCUSSIONS-

02:20:36.861 --> 02:20:38.830
REGARDING- SOME OF THE

02:20:38.897 --> 02:20:41.032
APPROPRIATIONS. ONE OF THE LINE

02:20:41.099 --> 02:20:42.033
I'M SO I WANTED TO ASK

02:20:42.100 --> 02:20:43.301
QUESTIONS ABOUT WAS THE CLEAN

02:20:43.368 --> 02:20:45.804
VEHICLE REBATE PROGRAM. THE IN

02:20:45.870 --> 02:20:47.438
THE PAST WE HAD COMMITMENTS

02:20:47.505 --> 02:20:50.241
FROM FINANCE OF COMMITTING TO A

02:20:50.308 --> 02:20:50.809
TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR

02:20:50.875 --> 02:20:53.311
BASELINE BUDGET MOVING FORWARD.

02:20:53.378 --> 02:20:55.246
OBVIOUSLY WAS SURPRISED THAT

02:20:55.313 --> 02:20:57.849
SEE THAT CHANGE. WE ALSO KNOW

02:20:57.916 --> 02:20:59.250
THAT WE HAVE CODIFIED ARE

02:20:59.317 --> 02:21:00.819
GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION HOLES

02:21:00.885 --> 02:21:06.991
INTO LAW AND- IT'S FOR BROADLY-

02:21:07.058 --> 02:21:07.992
PROBABLY AGREED ON THAT IF WE

02:21:08.059 --> 02:21:10.562
DON'T. REDUCE THE

02:21:10.628 --> 02:21:12.297
TRANSPORTATION EMISSIONS THAT

02:21:12.363 --> 02:21:13.298
WE WILL NOT GET THEIR

02:21:13.364 --> 02:21:15.066
TRANSPORTATION AS WE ALL KNOW

02:21:15.133 --> 02:21:16.334
IS 40% OF GREENHOUSE GAS

02:21:16.401 --> 02:21:17.969
EMISSIONS IT'S ALSO THE ONLY

02:21:18.036 --> 02:21:19.604
AREA. THAT CONTINUES TO

02:21:19.671 --> 02:21:21.039
INCREASE WILL ALL THE OTHER

02:21:21.105 --> 02:21:22.540
AREAS HAVE DECREASED WE'VE BEEN

02:21:22.607 --> 02:21:25.243
ABLE TO HAVE SUCCESS. SO IT IS-

02:21:25.310 --> 02:21:27.579
LITTLE BIT PUZZLING WHY THE

02:21:27.645 --> 02:21:30.648
ADMINISTRATION WOULD REDUCE THE

02:21:30.715 --> 02:21:33.017
ONE. CRITICAL AREA THAT WE NEED

02:21:33.084 --> 02:21:34.719
TO MAKE PROGRESS ON IN TERMS OF

02:21:34.786 --> 02:21:36.421
TRANSPORTATION. IN THE

02:21:36.487 --> 02:21:39.057
GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND-

02:21:39.123 --> 02:21:41.626
AND NOT LAY OUT ANY SORT OF

02:21:41.693 --> 02:21:43.695
ALTERNATIVE HOW WE ARE GOING TO

02:21:43.761 --> 02:21:45.930
REDUCE TRANSPORTATION EMISSIONS

02:21:45.997 --> 02:21:49.300
TO REALLY. RECHARGE CODIFY

02:21:49.367 --> 02:21:51.569
GOALS. I'LL MAKE JUST TWO

02:21:51.636 --> 02:21:53.071
POINTS FIRST DAYS OF YOU KNOW

02:21:53.137 --> 02:21:54.038
BY NOW FAMILIAR WITH THAT

02:21:54.105 --> 02:21:55.273
SOMEBODY CHALLENGES AND HAVING

02:21:55.340 --> 02:21:56.908
LESS FUNDING THAN LAST YEAR FOR

02:21:56.975 --> 02:21:58.209
IT THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM

02:21:58.276 --> 02:21:59.043
AND I KNOW THAT WILL BE AN

02:21:59.110 --> 02:22:00.545
ONGOING DISCUSSION WITH.

02:22:00.612 --> 02:22:02.180
LEGISLATURE LEGISLATORS AND THE

02:22:02.247 --> 02:22:03.982
GOVERNOR- I THINK THE FIRST IS

02:22:04.048 --> 02:22:05.149
WHEN WE WERE THINKING ABOUT THE

02:22:05.216 --> 02:22:06.518
GOVERNOR'S OR WHEN THE GOVERNOR

02:22:06.584 --> 02:22:07.118
WAS THINKING ABOUT THE

02:22:07.185 --> 02:22:09.520
GOVERNOR'S JANUARY PROPOSAL- IT

02:22:09.587 --> 02:22:10.488
WAS YOU KNOW MAKING SOME

02:22:10.555 --> 02:22:11.689
DIFFICULT DECISIONS BUT DID

02:22:11.756 --> 02:22:12.924
ALSO WANT TO FOCUS ON

02:22:12.991 --> 02:22:14.459
PARTICULAR. I DISADVANTAGED

02:22:14.525 --> 02:22:16.227
COMMUNITIES AND YET AND MAYBE

02:22:16.294 --> 02:22:17.028
GETTING SOME OF THE FACTS AND

02:22:17.095 --> 02:22:19.130
OF COURSE AS WE SAW YOU KNOW

02:22:19.197 --> 02:22:20.098
NOT YOU KNOW SOME OF THOSE

02:22:20.164 --> 02:22:21.866
PROGRAMS TO CARE CUT AS WELL-

02:22:21.933 --> 02:22:22.901
BUT THAT WAS THE GENERAL FRAME

02:22:22.967 --> 02:22:24.302
OF MIND BUT WE KNOW THAT THIS

02:22:24.369 --> 02:22:25.770
PROPOSAL WILL BE POURED OVER BY

02:22:25.837 --> 02:22:27.639
THE LEGISLATURE- THE SECOND

02:22:27.705 --> 02:22:28.773
POINT I MAKE IS WHEN IT COMES

02:22:28.840 --> 02:22:30.141
SPECIFICALLY TO LOW CARBON

02:22:30.208 --> 02:22:32.744
TRANSPORTATION- WE HOPE AND

02:22:32.810 --> 02:22:33.912
EXPECT THAT THAT WILL BE AT.

02:22:33.978 --> 02:22:36.781
AREA FOCUS FOR THE CLIMATE

02:22:36.848 --> 02:22:39.584
CATALYST FUND. THE COLOR.

02:22:39.651 --> 02:22:41.719
CLIMATE CALLOUS FUND IS FOCUSED

02:22:41.786 --> 02:22:45.390
ON. INFRASTRUCTURE CORRECT. IF

02:22:45.456 --> 02:22:47.725
YOU DON'T HAVE CARS TO CHARGE.

02:22:47.792 --> 02:22:50.295
WE GONA CHARGE THAT'S CORRECT

02:22:50.361 --> 02:22:50.895
AND THAT IS THAT IS GOOD POINT

02:22:50.962 --> 02:22:54.332
WE DO NEED BOTH. SO THEREFORE.

02:22:54.399 --> 02:22:55.967
THE THIS IS THE

02:22:56.034 --> 02:22:57.268
ADMINISTRATION'S POSITION THAT

02:22:57.335 --> 02:22:58.970
WE HAVE ENOUGH CLEAN CARS ON

02:22:59.037 --> 02:23:00.672
THE ROAD AND WE ONLY NEED TO

02:23:00.738 --> 02:23:02.307
FOCUS ON CHARGING

02:23:02.373 --> 02:23:03.074
INFRASTRUCTURE SO WE CAN REDUCE

02:23:03.141 --> 02:23:05.443
THE- COMMITMENT TO CLEAN CARS.

02:23:05.510 --> 02:23:06.511
NO DEFINITELY THE

02:23:06.577 --> 02:23:08.246
ADMINISTRATION THAT SUPPORTS

02:23:08.313 --> 02:23:09.647
FURTHER ADOPTION OF CLEAN CARS

02:23:09.714 --> 02:23:11.149
AND WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE A LOT

02:23:11.215 --> 02:23:13.618
MORE TO DO THERE. AND HOW WOULD

02:23:13.685 --> 02:23:15.586
WE PROPOSED TO DO THAT. SO IT'S

02:23:15.653 --> 02:23:17.021
CERTAINLY CHALLENGING WITHIN

02:23:17.088 --> 02:23:19.390
THE CONFINES OF THIS BUDGET- SO

02:23:19.457 --> 02:23:20.692
YOU KNOW THIS IS OUR PROPOSAL

02:23:20.758 --> 02:23:21.893
IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW WE ARE

02:23:21.960 --> 02:23:23.561
STILL FINDING THE C. D. R. P.

02:23:23.628 --> 02:23:25.330
IN OUR GENERAL BUDGET IT'S NOT

02:23:25.396 --> 02:23:26.664
AT THE LEVEL THAT WAS. LAST

02:23:26.731 --> 02:23:28.266
YEAR- BUT OF COURSE WHAT THE

02:23:28.333 --> 02:23:30.168
FINAL WILL LOOK LIKE WILL BE

02:23:30.234 --> 02:23:30.735
WHEN DISCUSSIONS WITH ALL OF

02:23:30.802 --> 02:23:33.805
YOU. IS THERE A- GREATER

02:23:33.871 --> 02:23:34.973
PRIORITY THAN CLEAN

02:23:35.039 --> 02:23:36.407
TRANSPORTATION IN TERMS OF

02:23:36.474 --> 02:23:39.143
REDUCING GREENHOUSE GASES. IT

02:23:39.210 --> 02:23:41.045
IS CERTAINLY AT THE TOP OF

02:23:41.112 --> 02:23:43.147
THEIR AMONG THAT TOP PRIORITIES

02:23:43.214 --> 02:23:44.949
THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT-

02:23:45.016 --> 02:23:46.651
BUT AS YOU CAN SEE WITH THE CAP

02:23:46.718 --> 02:23:48.086
AND TRADE PROGRAM THERE ARE A

02:23:48.152 --> 02:23:49.087
NUMBER OF OTHER PRIORITIES

02:23:49.153 --> 02:23:50.855
INCLUDING COMMITTEE KEEP BY AIR

02:23:50.922 --> 02:23:52.256
PROTECTION INCLUDING FORCED

02:23:52.323 --> 02:23:54.092
HEALTH WE WERE TALKING ABOUT SB

02:23:54.158 --> 02:23:55.193
NINE OH WIND. SO IT IS

02:23:55.259 --> 02:23:56.761
CHALLENGING TO EDUCATE AMONG

02:23:56.828 --> 02:23:59.263
THESE DIFFERENT PRIORITIES BUT

02:23:59.330 --> 02:23:59.831
CERTAINLY THIS REMAINS A TOP

02:23:59.897 --> 02:24:03.868
PRIORITY. IT SEEMS THAT MOST

02:24:03.935 --> 02:24:07.138
THE TOP PARTY'S ACCOUNT. ONLY

02:24:07.205 --> 02:24:07.705
BECAUSE THERE'S LESS FUNDING

02:24:07.772 --> 02:24:12.343
OVERALL DOT THEN HOW DOES THE

02:24:12.410 --> 02:24:13.878
ADMINISTRATION PROPOSED TO

02:24:13.945 --> 02:24:15.880
REDUCE GREENHOUSE GASES FOR

02:24:15.947 --> 02:24:17.215
TRANSPORTATION GIVEN THE

02:24:17.281 --> 02:24:20.985
SHORTFALL IN. GREEN AT THE

02:24:21.052 --> 02:24:22.720
GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND.

02:24:22.787 --> 02:24:24.889
I THINK WE WANT TO CONTINUE OUR

02:24:24.956 --> 02:24:26.457
EFFORTS SAID WITH CAP AND TRADE

02:24:26.524 --> 02:24:27.759
FUNDING IT MAY NOT BE AT THE

02:24:27.825 --> 02:24:29.894
LEVEL THAT IT WAS LAST YEAR- P.

02:24:29.961 --> 02:24:31.029
R. CERTAINLY  THINK WE CAN ALL

02:24:31.095 --> 02:24:32.563
AGREE ARE HOPING THAT IN MAY

02:24:32.630 --> 02:24:34.065
THAT WILL HAVE A BETTER SNSE

02:24:34.132 --> 02:24:35.400
OF MAYBE PROJECTIONS WHETHER

02:24:35.466 --> 02:24:37.502
FOR THE CAP AND TRADE FIND OR-

02:24:37.568 --> 02:24:39.470
GENERAL FUND MORE BROADLY WILL

02:24:39.537 --> 02:24:41.272
INCREASE- BUT CERTAINLY THE

02:24:41.339 --> 02:24:41.939
GOVERNOR IS TRYING TO DO THE

02:24:42.006 --> 02:24:43.841
BEST WITH WHAT WE ARE

02:24:43.908 --> 02:24:44.342
PROJECTING THE RESOURCES

02:24:44.409 --> 02:24:45.977
AVAILABLE. NO UNDERSTOOD BUT

02:24:46.044 --> 02:24:52.250
IT'S SORT OF. AGAIN ARE THAT WE

02:24:52.316 --> 02:24:56.087
HAVE ON WE UNDERSTAND YOUR

02:24:56.154 --> 02:24:57.522
LIMITATIONS BUT AGAIN YOU HAVE

02:24:57.588 --> 02:24:59.957
A FUND THAT I DON'T THINK HAS

02:25:00.024 --> 02:25:02.060
BEEN TRULY PRIORITIZE ME FOR

02:25:02.126 --> 02:25:03.895
EXAMPLE THERE RESOURCES BOARD

02:25:03.961 --> 02:25:04.595
WHICH IS UNDER THE

02:25:04.662 --> 02:25:07.832
ADMINISTRATION THEY- GIVEN THE

02:25:07.899 --> 02:25:09.467
SHORTFALL IN FUNDS THAT COULD

02:25:09.534 --> 02:25:11.369
HAVE MADE SOME TOUGH DECISIONS

02:25:11.436 --> 02:25:12.770
AND REALLY FOCUSED ON ONLY

02:25:12.837 --> 02:25:14.238
CLEAN TRANSPORTATION BUT THEY

02:25:14.305 --> 02:25:16.808
CONTINUE TO ALLOW PLUG IN

02:25:16.874 --> 02:25:20.445
HYBRIDS WITH A- RANGE OF TWENTY

02:25:20.511 --> 02:25:22.747
FIVE MILES. SO IF I HAD A PLUG

02:25:22.814 --> 02:25:24.916
IN HYBRID FOR MY NINETY MILE

02:25:24.982 --> 02:25:29.020
COMMUTE. ARE GET ONLY TWENTY

02:25:29.087 --> 02:25:29.921
FIVE OF THAT WOULD BE CLEAN AND

02:25:29.987 --> 02:25:32.657
THE REST OF IT WOULD BE. DIRT

02:25:32.723 --> 02:25:34.559
BUT I WOULD BE GETTING A

02:25:34.625 --> 02:25:39.530
INCENTIVE FROM THAT PROGRAM. SO

02:25:39.597 --> 02:25:41.666
YOU KNOW I TOTALLY AGREE THAT.

02:25:41.732 --> 02:25:44.202
LESS MONEY MEANS YOU HAVE TO.

02:25:44.268 --> 02:25:45.770
BE MORE FOUSED ON YOUR

02:25:45.837 --> 02:25:47.572
PRIORITIES BUT IT'S JUST NOT

02:25:47.638 --> 02:25:50.775
CLEAR TO ME WHERE THAT FOCUSES

02:25:50.842 --> 02:25:52.610
AT THIS POINT BECAUSE IT SEEMS

02:25:52.677 --> 02:25:54.145
LIKE THERE'S A LOT OF MIXED

02:25:54.212 --> 02:25:56.547
MESSAGES IT THE MESSAGE SEEMS

02:25:56.614 --> 02:25:58.616
TO BE. WORKING TO CONTINUE ON

02:25:58.683 --> 02:26:01.652
THE STATUS QUO BUDGET WITH LAST.

02:26:01.719 --> 02:26:04.789
IN AND HOPE TO. ACHIEVE OUR

02:26:04.856 --> 02:26:07.425
GOALS. VERSUS FOCUSING ON

02:26:07.492 --> 02:26:09.827
REALLY WHAT ARE THE- MOST

02:26:09.894 --> 02:26:12.063
SIGNIFICANT PRIORITIES. AND

02:26:12.130 --> 02:26:14.065
WHERE WHERE DO WE FOCUS LIMITED

02:26:14.132 --> 02:26:16.567
RESOURCES RATHER THAN SPREAD

02:26:16.634 --> 02:26:18.269
FEWER DOLLARS AROUND ALL THE

02:26:18.336 --> 02:26:23.674
AREAS WE HAVE. IT TO ME IT IS

02:26:23.741 --> 02:26:24.775
VERY CLEAR IF YOU HAVE A

02:26:24.842 --> 02:26:26.511
GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND

02:26:26.577 --> 02:26:28.546
IN TRANSPORTATION IS THE ONLY

02:26:28.613 --> 02:26:30.181
AREA THAT CONTINUES TO GROW

02:26:30.248 --> 02:26:32.750
WILL GO UP. YOU COULD FIND

02:26:32.817 --> 02:26:34.085
AGAIN THIS IS PART OF HIS

02:26:34.152 --> 02:26:35.319
PROBATION YOU HAVE INFILL

02:26:35.386 --> 02:26:37.588
HOUSING WE KNOW HOUSING FURTHER

02:26:37.655 --> 02:26:41.993
AWAY FROM- JOBS IS ABSOLUTELY-

02:26:42.059 --> 02:26:43.161
A CRITICAL FACTOR IN TERMS OF

02:26:43.227 --> 02:26:45.696
THIS- INCREASING TRANSPORTATION

02:26:45.763 --> 02:26:47.431
MISSIONS THAT THAT COULD MAKE

02:26:47.498 --> 02:26:48.199
SENSE IF THE IF THE

02:26:48.266 --> 02:26:49.333
ADMINISTRATION PROPOSED TO SAY

02:26:49.400 --> 02:26:50.234
HEY WE'RE GONNA DO MORE INFO

02:26:50.301 --> 02:26:52.136
HOW TO WIN TO LESS. LESS CARS

02:26:52.203 --> 02:26:54.238
WOULD USE ONLY GOOD DO ELECTRIC

02:26:54.305 --> 02:26:56.107
BUSES AND INFILL HOUSING AND

02:26:56.174 --> 02:26:57.775
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO GO I

02:26:57.842 --> 02:26:59.944
THINK THAT TO ME THAT. I MEAN I

02:27:00.011 --> 02:27:00.878
COMPLETELY AGREE WITH THAT BUT

02:27:00.945 --> 02:27:05.316
THAT WOULD BE A PROPOSED. RIGHT

02:27:05.383 --> 02:27:06.817
RIGHT NOW WILL BE HAVE IS. WE

02:27:06.884 --> 02:27:08.319
LOVE EVERYTHING PACK SO

02:27:08.386 --> 02:27:10.154
EVERYTHING'S GET LESS BECAUSE

02:27:10.221 --> 02:27:11.689
WE HAVE LESS MONEY. INTO ME

02:27:11.756 --> 02:27:13.357
WHAT WE HOPE IS DURING THIS.

02:27:13.424 --> 02:27:14.959
DELIBERATIONS PERHAPS WE COULD

02:27:15.026 --> 02:27:16.460
HAVE A BROADER DISCUSSION ABOUT

02:27:16.527 --> 02:27:18.529
REALLY WHERE WE CAN. I HAVE I

02:27:18.596 --> 02:27:19.597
THINK WE OFF THE SAME GOALS

02:27:19.664 --> 02:27:22.800
WITH KNOWLEDGE- THAT WE WANT TO

02:27:22.867 --> 02:27:24.035
GO REGIONAL SCHOOLS I THINK

02:27:24.101 --> 02:27:25.102
COULD BE COULD BE GREAT TO

02:27:25.169 --> 02:27:27.605
HAVE. A MORE IN DEPTH

02:27:27.672 --> 02:27:29.240
DISCUSSION EITHER IN COMMITTEE

02:27:29.307 --> 02:27:31.375
OR IN STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS TO

02:27:31.442 --> 02:27:33.744
REALLY FIGURE OUT WHERE WE-

02:27:33.811 --> 02:27:35.446
NEED TO PRIORITIZE BECAUSE

02:27:35.513 --> 02:27:37.515
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW. I THINK

02:27:37.582 --> 02:27:41.285
WHAT'S- WHAT'S BEEN DONE IS-

02:27:41.352 --> 02:27:43.955
EVERYONE JUST GOT LESS AND- I

02:27:44.021 --> 02:27:45.856
DON'T KNOW MY CONCERN IS THAT.

02:27:45.923 --> 02:27:47.892
WE HAVEN'T DECIDED HEY THIS IS

02:27:47.959 --> 02:27:49.760
THIS IS REALLY THE- NUMBER ONE

02:27:49.827 --> 02:27:51.028
PRIORITY SO THIS IS WHERE WE

02:27:51.095 --> 02:27:52.964
SHOULD GO. AND THIS IS WHERE WE

02:27:53.030 --> 02:27:54.198
SHOULD GIVE MONEY OR EVEN MORE

02:27:54.265 --> 02:27:57.235
MONEY. AND OTHER AREAS WELL

02:27:57.301 --> 02:28:00.137
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO WAIT

02:28:00.204 --> 02:28:02.306
TILL WE GET MORE MONEY. LATER

02:28:02.373 --> 02:28:03.507
SO TO ME I THEY'LL ARE THE

02:28:03.574 --> 02:28:05.543
CHOICES DON'T. JUST TAKING CALC

02:28:05.610 --> 02:28:07.445
AND DOING SOME DIVISION ACROSS

02:28:07.511 --> 02:28:10.548
THE BOARD WAS A TOUGH CHOICE.

02:28:10.615 --> 02:28:12.817
IN TERMS OF- EARNED INCOME TAX

02:28:12.884 --> 02:28:14.719
CREDIT. I MENTIONED THAT

02:28:14.785 --> 02:28:17.755
EARLIER- COULD COULD OU- I

02:28:17.822 --> 02:28:19.090
KNOW THE GOVERNOR WAS A BIG

02:28:19.156 --> 02:28:20.891
SUPPORTER OF EARNED INCOME TAX

02:28:20.958 --> 02:28:22.793
CREDIT WE HAVE. A LOT OF VERY

02:28:22.860 --> 02:28:25.129
HARD WORKING CALIFORNIANS WHO

02:28:25.196 --> 02:28:26.964
JUST. DON'T HAVE DOCUMENTATION

02:28:27.031 --> 02:28:28.899
BUT THEY'RE WORKING. THEY ARE

02:28:28.966 --> 02:28:32.370
WORKING POOR- COULD YOU

02:28:32.436 --> 02:28:34.739
ELIMINATE WHY- PERHAPS THOSE

02:28:34.805 --> 02:28:36.007
FOLKS WERE NOT INCLUDED INTO

02:28:36.073 --> 02:28:38.342

THIS BUDGET FINDS IT AT THE

02:28:43.180 --> 02:28:44.782
SAME LEVEL AND THOSE FIRST

02:28:44.849 --> 02:28:45.716

TWENTY NINETEEN TAX YEAR. I

02:28:52.089 --> 02:28:54.392
THINK IN THIS BUDGET- IT WAS

02:28:54.458 --> 02:28:55.493
SIMPLY A MATTER OF SPACE YOU

02:28:55.559 --> 02:28:57.395
KNOW THAT- EXPANDING TO THAT

02:28:57.461 --> 02:28:58.896
POPULATION WILL COST. YOU KNOW

02:28:58.963 --> 02:29:00.164
OVER A HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS

02:29:00.231 --> 02:29:01.499
IN TERMS OF THE SIZE OF THE TAX

02:29:01.565 --> 02:29:02.900
CREDIT- AND AS YOU KNOW THE

02:29:02.967 --> 02:29:04.902

INCLUDING ESPECIALLY. ON THE

02:29:10.141 --> 02:29:11.242
HEALTHCARE SIDE- SO THIS WAS

02:29:11.309 --> 02:29:14.445
SIMPLY A MATTER OF THE

02:29:14.512 --> 02:29:16.814
CONSTRAINTS THAT WE FACED. OKAY

02:29:16.881 --> 02:29:17.682
THANK. THANK YOU APPRECIATE

THAT IN TERM OF SO THAT THE

02:29:19.417 --> 02:29:20.518
HOMELESS IS PROPOSAL

02:29:20.584 --> 02:29:22.386
TRADITIONALLY THE LAST TWO

02:29:22.453 --> 02:29:24.789
BUDGETS WE'VE- PROPOSE MONEY

02:29:24.855 --> 02:29:26.724
ONE TIME MONEY- THE MONEY WAS

02:29:26.791 --> 02:29:29.060
MANAGE FINE EACH CD. THIS

02:29:29.126 --> 02:29:31.796
PROPOSAL IS REALLY- ASKING THE

02:29:31.862 --> 02:29:34.632
S. S. TO MANAGE A DIFFERENT.

02:29:34.699 --> 02:29:36.167
PART OF FUNDS COULD YOU EXPLAIN

02:29:36.233 --> 02:29:40.304
SORT OF Y. Y. DSS AND GIVEN

THE- AS YOU MENTION THE

02:29:41.772 --> 02:29:42.740
COMPLEMENTARY NATURE OF THE

02:29:42.807 --> 02:29:43.908
DIFFERENT FUNDED PROGRAMS HOW

02:29:43.974 --> 02:29:45.276
WOULD. HOW DO YOU ENSURE THAT

02:29:45.343 --> 02:29:48.746
YOU HAVE. TO STATE. DEPARTMENTS

02:29:48.813 --> 02:29:51.982
WHO DON'T ALWAYS. TALK TALK TO

EACH OTHER AND COORDINATE THIS

02:29:53.384 --> 02:29:54.819
THIS FUNDING WHICH TO ME SEEMS

02:29:54.885 --> 02:29:55.419
PROBABLY THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE

02:29:55.486 --> 02:29:57.521
OF ALL. YEAH SO MAKE TWO POINTS

02:29:57.588 --> 02:29:59.523
HAVING FIRST DAYS AT AS YOU

02:29:59.590 --> 02:30:01.359
KNOW YOU KNOW FROM YOU HOW WE

02:30:01.425 --> 02:30:02.493
DESCRIBE TO FIND IT'S A NUMBER

02:30:02.560 --> 02:30:03.794
OF DIFFERENT CHALLENGES THAT

02:30:03.861 --> 02:30:04.695
WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS AND

02:30:04.762 --> 02:30:05.730
WE'RE NOT. TRYING TO REPLACE

02:30:05.796 --> 02:30:07.565
COUNTIES BUT BETWEEN RENTAL

02:30:07.631 --> 02:30:09.200
SUBSIDIES IMPORTANT THEIR HOMES

02:30:09.266 --> 02:30:10.701
AND WE DO HOPE TO CONNECT MORE

02:30:10.768 --> 02:30:12.603
PEOPLE TO SERVICES- WE DID FEEL

02:30:12.670 --> 02:30:14.004
THAT DSS IS THE MOST.

02:30:14.071 --> 02:30:15.906
APPROPRIATE VEHICLE- AND

02:30:15.973 --> 02:30:17.241
GRANTED THERE'S A LOT IN THIS

02:30:17.308 --> 02:30:18.843
SPACE IN TERMS OF HOW WE CAN BE

02:30:18.909 --> 02:30:20.978
BETTER ORGANIZED- THE GOVERNOR

02:30:21.045 --> 02:30:22.012
EVEN SIGNALED AND IS EIGHT

02:30:22.079 --> 02:30:23.247
PAGES ALTHOUGH THIS WILL BE A

02:30:23.314 --> 02:30:24.815
LONGER TERM PROPOSITION THAT.

02:30:24.882 --> 02:30:25.983
HE'S EXPLORING THE CREATION OF

02:30:26.050 --> 02:30:27.518
A UNIFIED WHOLE HOMELESSNESS

02:30:27.585 --> 02:30:29.253
AND HOUSING DEPARTMENT OR

02:30:29.320 --> 02:30:31.389
AGENCY- SO DEFINITELY THAT'S

02:30:31.455 --> 02:30:31.989
SOMETHING THAT WE'RE THINKING

02:30:32.056 --> 02:30:33.457
ABOUT AND I THINK THE SECOND

02:30:33.524 --> 02:30:34.892
POINT I MAKE- WHICH IS

02:30:34.959 --> 02:30:36.327
UNSATISFYING RIGHT NOW BUT-

02:30:36.394 --> 02:30:37.962
WHEN THE NEXT. COUPLE WEEKS IS

02:30:38.028 --> 02:30:39.296
THAT WE ARE WORKING VERY HARD

02:30:39.363 --> 02:30:40.564
ON THE DETAILS OF THIS WE KNOW.

02:30:40.631 --> 02:30:42.333
IT'S NEW AND IT'S NOT A FULL

02:30:42.400 --> 02:30:43.467
DETAIL AT THE LEGISLATURE CAN

02:30:43.534 --> 02:30:45.002
REALLY EVALUATING THE

02:30:45.069 --> 02:30:47.104
SIGNIFICANT WAY RIGHT NOW. SO

02:30:47.171 --> 02:30:48.873
LITERALLY DAYS IF NOT WEEKS IT

02:30:48.939 --> 02:30:49.974
WOULD SET OF WERE REALLY DAYS

02:30:50.040 --> 02:30:51.509
FROM NOW WE'RE GONNA PUT OUT

02:30:51.575 --> 02:30:54.111
THIS FIRST- COUPLE DETAIL AND

02:30:54.178 --> 02:30:56.147
THEN WE WILL DISCUSS. WITH YOU

02:30:56.213 --> 02:31:03.254
ALL THIS. PROPOSAL. AS YOU

02:31:05.656 --> 02:31:08.592
WAS YOU KNOW ONE OF THE- MORE

02:31:08.659 --> 02:31:09.460
ONE OR TWO TOP PRIORITIES

02:31:09.527 --> 02:31:11.061
REALLY THE YEAR DOT ALONG WITH.

02:31:11.128 --> 02:31:11.629
REALLY WHAT'S GOING ON WITH

02:31:11.695 --> 02:31:12.797
WHAT FIRES SEEMS TO. VERY MUCH

02:31:12.863 --> 02:31:13.431
SORT OF TOP OF MIND AS WELL AS

02:31:13.497 --> 02:31:14.965
VERY. IN ALL OF OUR CAN. SO WE

02:31:15.032 --> 02:31:16.567
GOING TO VERY. SUPPORT IN THIS.

02:31:16.634 --> 02:31:17.735
BUT WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE

02:31:17.802 --> 02:31:19.770
THAT. WE HAVE AGENCIES ARE

02:31:19.837 --> 02:31:21.372
WORKING TOGETHER. THAT ARE

02:31:21.439 --> 02:31:23.040
WORKING COMPLEMENTARY AND SAYS

02:31:23.107 --> 02:31:24.809

THAT THE COMPLEMENT EACH OTHER.

02:31:27.945 --> 02:31:29.046
BUT THE CONCERN IS WHEN YOU

HAVE. TO AGENCIES THAT ARE

02:31:30.915 --> 02:31:32.650
COMPLETELY SILO WHO. REALLY

02:31:32.716 --> 02:31:34.952
DON'T HAVE ANY KIND OF. WORKING

02:31:35.019 --> 02:31:39.056
RELATIONSHIP- TO PASS THEM.

02:31:39.123 --> 02:31:44.462
REALLY TO. DEAL WITH. HILL THE

02:31:44.528 --> 02:31:46.597
MAJOR ISSUE OF THE I THINK WAS

02:31:46.664 --> 02:31:47.998
ASKING QUITE BECAUSE ASKING

02:31:48.065 --> 02:31:50.668
QUITE A BIT I THINK THE- IDEA

02:31:50.734 --> 02:31:53.103
OF HAVING A HOUSING AND

02:31:53.170 --> 02:31:54.205
HOMELESSNESS AGENCIES A REALLY

02:31:54.271 --> 02:31:56.407
INTRIGUING IDEA. ON IN REALLY

02:31:56.474 --> 02:31:58.542
ELEVATING THE PRIORITY WE KNOW

02:31:58.609 --> 02:32:00.044
THAT WE DIDN'T GET TO THIS

02:32:00.110 --> 02:32:01.846
HOMELESSNESS CRISIS LAST YEAR

02:32:01.912 --> 02:32:04.181
WAS ONE THAT WAS CREATED- EVEN

02:32:04.248 --> 02:32:05.483
THE LAST TWO OR THREE YEARS

02:32:05.549 --> 02:32:07.017
AND- SOME OF THE HOUSING CRISIS

02:32:07.084 --> 02:32:10.788
IN IT IN IT DOES- IT DOES. SEEM

02:32:10.855 --> 02:32:12.823
LIKE IT WOULD MAKE SENSE TO

02:32:12.890 --> 02:32:15.860
REALLY ELEVATE THE ISSUE. TO A

02:32:15.926 --> 02:32:19.063
HIGHER LEVEL KNOWING THAT EVEN.

02:32:19.129 --> 02:32:20.898
IN THIS ADMINISTRATION'S TENURE

02:32:20.965 --> 02:32:22.633
WE PROBABLY WON'T BE ABLE TO

02:32:22.700 --> 02:32:24.969
SOLVE. THE PROBLEM GIVEN JUST

02:32:25.035 --> 02:32:26.170
HOW LONG IT TAKES TO CONSTRUCT

02:32:26.237 --> 02:32:27.972
HOUSING. ELEMENT TAKES TO

02:32:28.038 --> 02:32:30.641
CONSTRUCT- PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE

02:32:30.708 --> 02:32:32.943
HOUSING. HE IF EVERYTHING WENT

02:32:33.010 --> 02:32:34.178
PERFECTLY DURING ALL OF OUR

02:32:34.245 --> 02:32:35.946
TENURE WE CAN ONLY HOPE TO.

02:32:36.013 --> 02:32:38.148
REALLY MAKE A DENT GOING INTO

02:32:38.215 --> 02:32:39.750
THE TO THE NEXT ADMINISTRATION

02:32:39.817 --> 02:32:42.620
FRANKLY. ON REALLY ELEVATING

02:32:42.686 --> 02:32:45.422
THE- ISSUE I THINK WOULD. MAKE

02:32:45.489 --> 02:32:47.291
A LOT OF SENSE AND ALSO MOST

02:32:47.358 --> 02:32:49.593
POORLY ENSURE THAT WE HAVE

02:32:49.660 --> 02:32:52.496
COORDINATION. BETWEEN ALL THE

02:32:52.563 --> 02:32:52.997
VARIOUS AGENCIES WHO ARE

02:32:53.063 --> 02:32:55.266
REALLY. WORKING ON THIS ISSUE

02:32:55.332 --> 02:32:57.468
WE YOU KNOW WE WERE VERY PROUD

02:32:57.535 --> 02:32:59.336
TO WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH THE

02:32:59.403 --> 02:33:01.338
ADMINISTRATION LAST YEAR. ON

02:33:01.405 --> 02:33:02.840
NOT JUST ON HOMELESSNESS

02:33:02.907 --> 02:33:04.608
FUNDING BUT ALSO AROUND EVERY

02:33:04.675 --> 02:33:05.843
HEALTH ISSUES WE KNOW THAT

02:33:05.910 --> 02:33:09.613
THAT'S THAT IS. A PIECE OF THE

02:33:09.680 --> 02:33:11.682
PUZZLE BUT- SINCE THAT FIRMLY

02:33:11.749 --> 02:33:14.852
FOR AND THE- HERE HUMANS PUBLIC

02:33:14.919 --> 02:33:17.288
HEALTH AREA AND ENSURING THAT

02:33:17.354 --> 02:33:19.223
THERE IS THAT COORDINATION THIS

02:33:19.290 --> 02:33:22.426
IS ALWAYS DIFFICULT. SO AGAIN

02:33:22.493 --> 02:33:24.361
WE KNOW THAT- YEAH THIS IS

02:33:24.428 --> 02:33:26.363
SOMETHING THAT IS- TOP PRIORITY

02:33:26.430 --> 02:33:27.398
FOR THE ADMINISTRATION IS AS

02:33:27.464 --> 02:33:29.400
ALLOWS FOR MANY OF US WE WANT

02:33:29.466 --> 02:33:31.602
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GET OUR

02:33:31.669 --> 02:33:34.138
DIALOGUE IN TOGETHER TO MAKE

02:33:34.204 --> 02:33:37.775
SURE. TO MAKE IT RIGHT. HAVING

02:33:37.841 --> 02:33:38.709
SAID THAT LET ME JUST MAKE A

02:33:38.776 --> 02:33:40.678
FEW JUST FINAL COMMENTS JUST TO

02:33:40.744 --> 02:33:41.245
REITERATE I THINK WHERE WE

02:33:41.312 --> 02:33:44.481
STARTED- WE THINK THAT THIS

02:33:44.548 --> 02:33:46.617
BUDGET IS A VERY GOOD BUDGET-

02:33:46.684 --> 02:33:48.485
OVERALL I BELIEVE THAT IT

02:33:48.552 --> 02:33:51.055
REALLY HIGHLIGHTS A LOT OF THE

02:33:51.121 --> 02:33:52.923
DIALOGUE THAT WENT ON DURING

02:33:52.990 --> 02:33:54.625
THE RECESS I KNOW THAT MOST

02:33:54.692 --> 02:33:56.493
PEOPLE THINK DURING RECESS WORK

02:33:56.560 --> 02:33:59.730
ON AND OFF AT HOME ON VACATION

02:33:59.797 --> 02:34:01.632
I DON'T REALLY SEE MUCH OF THE

02:34:01.699 --> 02:34:03.300
WORK THAT HAPPENS EITHER HERE

02:34:03.367 --> 02:34:04.368
IN SACRAMENTO OR IN OUR HOME

02:34:04.435 --> 02:34:06.637
DISTRICTS- WE THINK THIS BUDGET

02:34:06.704 --> 02:34:09.073
REFLECTS MUCH OF THE DISCUSSION

02:34:09.139 --> 02:34:10.774
PICKING UP FROM WHERE WE LEFT

02:34:10.841 --> 02:34:14.278
OFF LAST JUNE. MANY ITEMS THAT

02:34:14.345 --> 02:34:16.580
AGAIN WERE- WEREN'T ABLE TO BE

02:34:16.647 --> 02:34:18.015
IN A BUDGET WHICH IS ALWAYS

02:34:18.082 --> 02:34:19.750
WHAT HAPPENS WERE OR VERY HAPPY

02:34:19.817 --> 02:34:22.319

02:34:22.386 --> 02:34:23.187
I KNOW A NUMBER OF MY

02:34:23.253 --> 02:34:24.288
LEGISLATIVE COLLEAGUES WERE

02:34:24.355 --> 02:34:26.223

02:34:26.290 --> 02:34:27.691
SUPPORTIVE OF THAT AND IT

02:34:27.758 --> 02:34:29.526
REALLY- AGAIN WHICH

02:34:29.593 --> 02:34:30.761
DEMONSTRATES THAT THE

02:34:30.828 --> 02:34:33.263
ADMINISTRATION IS DIALOGUING

02:34:33.330 --> 02:34:34.198
WITH THE LEGISLATURE BEFORE

02:34:34.264 --> 02:34:36.900
PROPOSING SOMETHING IN JANUARY

02:34:36.967 --> 02:34:43.007

02:34:46.076 --> 02:34:46.610
WE UNDERSTAND THAT NOT ALL OF

02:34:46.677 --> 02:34:48.512
THEM CAN BE READY ON JAN TEN

02:34:48.579 --> 02:34:50.981

DIALOGUE AND DISCUSSION AND WE

02:34:59.857 --> 02:35:01.091
COULD REALLY UNDERSTAND WHERE.

02:35:01.158 --> 02:35:03.160
MANY OF THESE PLACES ARE GOING-

02:35:03.227 --> 02:35:07.731

SURE THAT WE HAVE AN

02:35:22.846 --> 02:35:24.381
OPPORTUNITY TO KIND OF FLUSH

02:35:24.448 --> 02:35:26.817
OUT SOME OF THE DETAILS ALONG

02:35:26.884 --> 02:35:27.484

ALSO KNOW THAT SOMETIMES- WE

02:35:52.476 --> 02:35:54.378
CAN'T HAVE THIS FULL DISCUSSION

02:35:54.445 --> 02:35:55.746
