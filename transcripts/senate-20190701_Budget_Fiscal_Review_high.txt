WELCOME THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- THE SECRETARY NOTICES THE PRESENCE OF A QUORUM OF LIKE TO WELCOME. EVERYONE TO I THINK I'VE SAID THE LAST COUPLE OF TIMES TO THE FINAL BUDGET HEARING OF THE YEAR. BUT I THINK -- THIS TIME IT REALLY WILL BE FINAL THANK YOU TODAY WE'RE GONNA HEAR ONE BILL THE HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS TREE RUBIO. AGAIN WHICH IS THE FINAL TRAILER BILL ASSOCIATE WITH THE CURRENT BUDGET PACKAGE. AFTER TODAY'S HEARING A B. ONE OH ONE WILL BE ELIGIBLE TO BE TAKEN UP ON THE FLOOR COLLEAGUES THIS AFTERNOON. PRIOR TO STARTING IT'S IT'S NO TIME LIKE YOU KNOW THE LAST HEARING OF THE EAR TO HAVE TWO NEW MEMBERS JOIN US. WE WANT TO WELCOME -- TO SENATE BUDGET COMMITTEE SENATOR DOLLY INCOME A YEAR AGO WELCOME TO THE SENATE BUDGET COMMITTEE. WITH THAT MISTER VICE CHAIRMAN ANY REMARKS FROM YOU. OKAY THANK YOU -- GOOD AFTERNOON FINANCE WERE PREPARED TO HEAR FROM YOU ALL ON A B.. ONE OH ONE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THE KEY ITEMS IN THIS BILL ARE REGARDING HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS. ON HOUSING THIS BILL ALLOCATES ONE POINT SEVEN FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN TOTAL SPENDING TO ADDRESS THE HOUSING CRISIS. AND HOMELESSNESS -- THE OVERALL BUDGET PACKAGE THAT WAS AGREED TO BETWEEN THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE LEGISLATURE INVESTS A BILLION DOLLARS IN HOMELESSNESS -- SERVICES AND PREVENTION OF WHICH SIX HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IS IN THIS BILL AND I'LL BRIEFLY GO THROUGH BOTH OF THOSE ITEMS. ON THE HOUSING PACKAGE THIS BILL INCLUDES TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN PLANNING AND PRODUCTION GRANTS FOR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. THIS IS SPLIT BETWEEN A ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS AND ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION FOR REGIONAL EFFORTS. AND ALSO INCLUDES FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE INFO INFRASTRUCTURE GRANT PROGRAM AND THAT INCLUDES OVERALL SET ASIDE OF ABOUT NINETY MILLION DOLLARS US PARTICULARLY FOR COUNTIES WITH LESS THAN A QUARTER MILLION PEOPLE. THERE'S ALSO A FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO CAL HFA FOR MIXED INCOME LOAN PROGRAM. AND FINALLY FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO EXPAND THE USE OF THE LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDIT PROGRAM. IN ADDITION TO THIS PROGRAM TO ONE POINT SEVEN FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN SPENDING FOR HOUSING SUPPORTS. THE BILL ALSO INCLUDES A PLAN FOR BONUS POINTS FOR JURISDICTIONS WITH PRO HOUSING POLICIES AND WONDER APPLYING FOR DISCRETIONARY GRANTS -- AND THESE INCLUDE PROGRAMS LIKE TRANSFORMERS CLIMATE COMMUNITIES THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES PROGRAM AND THE AFTER MENTIONED IT'S INFRASTRUCTURE GRANT PROGRAM. IT ALSO INCLUDES SOME CHANGES FOR THE LOCAL HOUSING TRUST FUND MAKING MATCHING GRANTS AVAILABLE TO NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBES -- AS WELL AS SUPPORT FOR MORE BUILDING OF AUXILIARY DRUGS WILL DO ALL IN YOUR HEAD CITIES ARE SECONDARY OFTEN KNOWN AS GRANNY FLATS -- TO INCREASE THE SUPPLY OF HOUSING. WHEN IT COMES TO HOMELESSNESS THE OVERALL BUDGET AMOUNT IS SIX HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS AND WE KNOW THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF NEGOTIATION BETWEEN MEMBERS OF THE ADMINISTRATION AND LEGISLATURE AND WHAT'S WITH THE STAFF? AND THE ALLOCATION THAT IS IN THIS BILL IS TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR WHAT'S KNOWN AS THE BIG THIRTEEN THESE AR CITIES -- WITH AN ADDITION -- THESE ARE CITIES WITH ABOUT THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE AND POPULATION -- IN ADDITION TO THAT THERE'S ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR COUNTIES ONE HUNDRED NINETY NINE DOLLARS FOR A CONTINUUM OF CARE THESE ARE KNOWN AS CEO SEES THEIR DESIGNATED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL FOR MORE REGIONAL EFFORTS. AND FINALLY TEN MILLION DOLLARS TO BE PROGRAMMED AT A FUTURE DATE. IN ADDITION TO THOSE FUNDS THIS BILL ALSO EXPANDS THE ELIGIBLE USE OF FUNDS -- AND MORE FLEXIBILITY IN HOW JURISDICTIONS ATTACKED THE HOMELESSNESS CRISIS. THEY MAKE IT EASIER TO BUILD LOW BARRIER NAVIGATION CENTERS INCLUDING EXPANDING THE USE UP BY RIGHT -- BUILDING -- AND AS WELL -- EXTENDING THE DEADLINE FOR THE AUDIT OF THE COMMITTEE BASED TRANSITIONAL HOUSING PROGRAM THIS WAS PREVIOUSLY VIEW AND NOW WILL BE AN AUDIT. AND THEN THE FINAL PACKAGE PART OF THIS PACKAGE THAT I WANT TO MENTION IS WITH REGARD TO HAVE REMEDIES FOR JURISDICTIONS THAT DON'T MEET THEIR HOUSING ELEMENT AS REQUIRED BY LAW. OF COURSE THE ADMINISTRATION WANTS TO WORK WITH JURISDICTIONS IN HOPES THAT EVERY JURISDICTION THAT IS NOT IN COMPLIANCE CAN COME INTO COMPLIANCE. FOR THOSE JURISDICTIONS THAT DON'T BUT THEY DON'T PLAN TO ME -- MEET THOSE PLANNING AND ZONING TARGETS -- THERE WILL BE UNDER THIS BILL I NOTICE AND TWO CONVERSATIONS EITHER IN PERSON OR OVER THE PHONE WITH THAT JURISDICTION TO TRY TO BRING THEM INTO COMPLIANCE. ONLY AFTER THOSE CONVERSATIONS AND THAT DUE PROCESS WHATEVER FOR ALL BE MADE TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE FOR A LAWSUIT. AGAINST I. JURISDICTION IF THAT LAWSUIT TAKES PLACE AND IF IT IS SUCCESSFUL AND THE JUDGE RULES THAT THE JURISDICTION IS NOT IN COMPLIANCE WITH EXISTING STATE HOUSING ELEMENT LAW. AT THAT POINT THE JUDGE WOULD HAVE TO ISSUE A SEPARATE ORDER SAYING THAT THE JURISDICTION MUST COME INTO COMPLIANCE AND THE JURISDICTION WOULD HAVE A FULL YEAR TO DO SO. ONLY AFTER THAT FOR YOUR LAPSED AND THE JURISDICTION IS STILL NOT IN COMPLIANCE WITH EXISTING LAW AT THAT DATE WHAT FINDS BE IMPOSED ON THAT JURISDICTION THESE WOULD BE BETWEEN TEN THOUSAND AND A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS -- AND THEN IF THE JURISDICTION CONTINUES NOT TO COME INTO COMPLIANCE AFTER THAT THERE ARE SOME ADDITIONAL REMEDIES -- DEFINES COULD BE INCREASED AND FINALLY AS A LAST RESORT WITHIN THE DISCRETION OF THE COURT -- AND AGING OF THE COURT MAY BE APPOINTED TO HELP BRING THAT JURISDICTION INTO COMPLIANCE SO I KNOW THIS HAS BEEN THE PRODUCT OF A LOT OF PRODUCTIVE NEGOTIATION CONVERSATION WITH MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE AND LEGISLATIVE STAFF. AS WE APPRECIATE THE CHANCE TO WORK WITH YOU AND HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS ON ANY ELEMENT OF THIS PACKAGE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER DALI. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR -- SO AS SOME OF YOU SAT ON A MORE SUPERVISORS FOR SIXTEEN YEARS ENDED. GENERAL PLAN AMENDMENTS AND SO. I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE COMPLIANCE PART FOR CITIES AND COUNTIES THAT ARE IN COMPLIANCE AND AND YOU KNOW THAT. IF YOU HAVE A GENERAL PLAN THAT IS IN CONFORMANCE AND YOU DON'T MEET YOUR HOUSING -- ELEMENT IT'S QUITE FRANKLY 99% THE TIME IT'S DUE TO THE FACT THAT. DEVELOPERS ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THIS IS THAT THE PLAN THE GENERAL PLAN OPTIONS BECAUSE THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO GET A RETURN ON THEIR INVESTMENT AND THAT SO I'VE I'VE RAN THE TRAP LINE ON QUITE A FEW OF THE COMMUNITIES I REPRESENT. AND THE COST IS SO HIGH THAT THERE'S TOO MUCH RISK AND THAT'S WHY WE DON'T SEE A LOT OF HOUSES BUILT QUITE FRANKLY IN. ALL OF CALIFORNIA SO NOW WE'RE GONNA GO IN AND AND COMPOUND THAT EVEN MORE SO LOCAL JURISDICTIONS DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO RAISE TAXES TO PAY EVEN FIND SUED -- IF IF THEY'RE GONNA COME IN. AND I KNOW YOU'E TRYING. TO COURAGE THEM ALONG. THROUGH WITH THE PROCESS THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT I I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY. IF YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO BUILD THOSE HOMES NOW -- INTEL WE DRIVE THE COST OF THOSE HOMES DOWN -- SOMEHOW -- YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET MORE HOMES WERE GONNA BE THE SAME THAT'S WHY THEY'RE NOT BUILDING HOSE AUS BECAUSE DEVELOPERS -- THERE'S TOO BIG OF A RISK AND THEY DON'T GET A RETURN ON THEIR INVESTMENT. SO I IT'S LIKE CONTINUE TO GO AFTER. CITIES AND COUNTIES DON'T BUILD HOUSES WE INCENTIVIZE YES HAT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE WE'RE ACTUALLY GONNA PUT MONEY INTO SIN OF EYES -- HOUSING WHICH IS -- IT WILL BE HELPFUL IN DRIVING THAT COST DOWN BUT THERE'S THAT MONEY'S COMING FROM TAXPAYERS SO. I'M A LITTLE NERVOUS ABOUT HAVING A HAMMER ON CITIES AND COUNTIES -- BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE NOT THE REALLY THE ONES THAT BUILD HOMES AS DEVELOPERS TO BUILD HOMES. I THINK I'LL MAKE A COUPLE BRIEF POINTS IN MY COLLEAGUE DANIELLE MAY WANT TO WEIGH IN AS WELL -- THE FIRST THING IS FOR THIS SPECIFIC LAW THAT HOUSING ELEMENT -- IT'S NOT REALLY FOCUSED ON THAT PRODUCTION ALTHOUGH THAT IS THE GOAL TO GET THESE HOUSES. BUILT IN THE AND OF COURSE THAT'S WHAT WE WANT AND THIS IS PART OF THAT BUT WHEN I SAY IT'S NOT FOCUSED ON THAT THE JURISDICTIONS DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE. TO PRODUCE THE HOUSES IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH THE LAW THIS IS EVEN WELL BEFORE THAT IT SIMPLY. PUTTING TOGETHER A PLAN AND MAKING PLANNING AND ZONING DECISIONS THAT ARE IN COMPLIANCE WITH HOUSING ELEMENT LAWS SO IT'S MUCH MORE BEFORE -- DEVELOPERS SAY HEY IT'S EXPENSIVE TO BUILD YOUR END PART OF THE LAW AND YOU MENTIONED IT'S INCENTIVES AS WELL WITH THE INFO INFRASTRUCTURE GRANT PROGRAM OFTEN DEVELOPERS DON'T WANT TO BUILD BECAUSE THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT THAT BUILDING IS IN REALLY THERE SO WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS SUPPORT TEIR BUT THIS. IS BEFORE THEN EXISTING LAW JUST SAYING WHAT STATE HOUSING ELEMENT LAW YOU SHOULD PUT TOGETHER A PLAN AND EXCITING DECISIONS THAT COMPLY WITH THAT WHETHER DEVELOPERS ARE OTHERS BUILD OR NOT. AND THEN I THINK THE SECOND PART IS YOU MENTIONED SOME THESE JURISDICTIONS EVERYONE IS IN A DIFFERENT SITUATION SO AS PART OF THE REMEDIES INCLUDING THOSE THAT ARE A LAST RESORT. BUT THERE IS A PART OF THE BILL THAT ALLOWS FOR MITIGATING CIRCUMSTANCES OF JURISDICTION DIDN'T HAVE THE RESOURCES OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW WE'VE TALKED ABOUT IN THIS COMMITTEE ABOUT EMERGENCY SITUATIONS IN ON PARADISE. THIS LAW IS NOT GOING TO BE ENFORCED AGAINST THE COMMUNITY LIKE THAT WHEN THEY'RE COMING OUT OF THAT DISASTER LIKE THAT SO THERE IS SOME DISCRETION FOR THE JUDGE TO MAKE THOSE TYPES OF DETERMINATIONS. SO IS THERE ANY FUNDS AVAILABLE ENTERED ACTUALLY HELP THEM. WITH THEIR THEIR GENERAL PLAN AMENDMENTS. SO GENERALLY REVIEW THAT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS THAT'S GOING TO LOCAL% JURISDICTIONS AS PROVIDING THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE -- TO COME UP WITH THESE PLANS. OKAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS SENATOR MORLOCK. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR -- IS THERE ANY INTEGRATION WITH NO PLACE LIKE HOME -- WE'RE TRYING TO BUILD HOUSING WITH PROP TO FIND SO I'M I'M WONDERING IF WE CAN DO SOME BLENDING SO WE GET A BONUS TO SOME OF THESE COMMUNITIES. GOOD AFTERNOON DANIEL FRIEND OF DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND NO PLACE LIKE HOME FUNDS SHOULD BE DEPLOYED THE SIDE. THEY HAVE BEEN APPLIED UP MY APOLOGIES -- THIS LATE LAST SPRING AND THE USES ARE SIMILAR TO SOME OF THESE OTHERS AND THEY CAN BE USED N COMBINATION WITH OTHER FUNDS -- TO BASICALLY BUILD HOT HOUSING ENTRANCES FROM HOUSING. AND JUST FROM A ANOTHER QUESTION DIFFERENT SUBJECT BUT JUST FROM AN ECONOMIC STANDPOINT IF IF WE KNOW THIS. THE FUSION OF FUNDING IS BECOMING AVAILABLE WITH THAT. KEEP THE PRICE OF RAW LAND THESE INFILL PROPERTIES WITH THAT KEEP IT STABLE WOULD INCREASE IT WOULD DECREASE IT BUT IT. GIVE A LIKE I'M AN ECONOMIC MODEL ON WHAT WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN. SO YOU'RE TALKING SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THE EXISTING PRICE OF LAND WITHOUT DEVELOPMENT ON IT RIGHT IF I HAD SOME INSTILL PROPERTY I'M THINKING IF THERE IS A STATE PROGRAM COMING WITH SOME FINDING I MIGHT WANT TO HOLD OUT FOR A HIGHER PRICE. SO I THINK THE WHAT WITH THE WAY WE'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT THIS IS BY -- RIGHT NOW IN A LOT OF THESE WELL ON ON THIS LAND IT'S NOT SIT SIMPLY NOT ZONED FOR HOUSING. SO YOU KNOW WHERE IS THAT ONE SPECIFIC PROPERTY IF YOU ZONE IT FOR ADDITIONAL USES ON IT COULD POTENTIALLY INCREASE THE VALUE OF THAT LAND BUT IT'S THE OVERALL SUPPLY -- HOUSING IN CALIFORNIA IS INCREASED THAT SHOULD IN ARGUE MAKE UP HOUSES HOUSING MORE AFFORDABLE. AND THEN -- MY LAST QUESTION -- WE KEEP HEARING ABOUT MORAN. IT IS MARIN EXEMPTED. SO I DON'T BELIEVE THERE'S ANYTHING IN THIS BILL BEFORE YOU REGARDING MORAN. I DON'T BELIEVE IT'S IN THE SPILL. THEY'RE ALWAYS SPECIAL. THANK YOU MENTOR YOU'RE WELCOME SIR STERN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR -- THING MAN MR IS ONE OF THEM WHEN IT JUST. ASK YOU TO FLESH OUT THE SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. FRAMEWORK AND HELP US REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT. WHAT SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE MEANS VERSUS JUST TO RESTRICT FRAME OR CAN YOU? HELP ELABORATE YES SO THE WAY AT THE ADMINISTRATION AND WORKING WITH NUMBERS THE LEGISLATURE THINKING ABOUT THIS IS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT -- WE'RE BRINGING JURISDICTIONS INTO COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAW -- BUT WE ALSO WANT TO JURISDICTIONS TO UNDERSTAND THAT WE WERE NOT GOING THAT NICKEL AND DIME THEM OR HIT THEM FOR EVERY LAST VIOLATION WE WANT THEM TO COMPLY AND THE PENALTIES ARE ONLY. IF THEY NOT ONLY DON'T COMPLY BUT AFTER A PERIOD OF AT LEAST ONE TO ONE AND A HALF YEARS. AFTER THE JUDGE ISSUES THEIR FINAL ORDER THEY'RE STILL NOT IN COMPLIANCE TO THE REASON WE USE THE TERM SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE IS WE WANNA JURISDICTIONS TO KNOW THAT IF YOU ARE BASICALLY DOING THE RIGHT THING YOU KNOW MAYBE THERE'S A CERTAIN PARTY OR PLANNED IT DOESN'T EXACTLY ALIGNED. WITH WHAT HCV HAD IMAGINED AT THE OUTSET -- BUT THE COURT SEES IT AS THEIR THEY'RE TRYING TO FOLLOW THE LAW THERE MAKING A GOOD FAITH EFFORT THAT THEY HADN'T MADE BEFORE. AND THAT BRINGS YOU INTO SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAW SO IT GOES BACK TO THAT PURPOSE THAT WE WANT YOUR SECTIONS TO DO THE RIGHT THING. EVEN AT THE END OF THIS REMEDY ACCORD ABOUT IMPOSED REMEDY WE STILL WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE WORKING WITH THEM AND NOT SIPLY FILING LAWSUITS AGAINST THEM. SO SO WHAT FACTORS PLAY INTO THAT DETERMINATION THAT HAVE SORT OF A GOOD FAITH EFFORT AT AND DID EFFORTS TOWARDS THE UP PLANNING UPDATE IT MEANS OR WHAT WHAT FACTORS ARE IN THIS YEAR I JUST WONDER WHAT THE COURTS WOULD LOOK TO IN TERMS OF NOT BEING. TOTAL -- STRICT CONSTRUCTIONIST ON EXACTLY WHAT MAKES SENSE. SERVER. THEY'RE THEY'RE I THINK THEY'RE TWO THINGS TO NOTE ONE IS THAT THE COURT WITH A LOOK AT AND SAY -- IS YOUR PATTERN OF BEHAVIOR SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT FROM BEFORE YOU KNOW BECAUSE WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT WHY EVEN BRINGS -- THE LAWSUIT INTO PLACES ONLY AFTER THESE TWO MEETINGS IT'S AFTER A NOTICE DAN DIA TOURNEY GENERAL FILES A LAWSUIT AND THEN THERE'S A WHOLE COURT HEARING BEFORE THE COURT IMPOSES ITS JUDGMENT. AND SO PRESUMABLY THINGS ARE ONLY GETTING TO THAT POINT BECAUSE THERE IS A PRETTY WIDE GULF BETWEEN THE LAW AS INTERPRETED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND DEVELOPMENT. AND HOW THE JURISDICTION IS ACTING SO IF THERE IS A BIG SWITCH IN THE JURISDICTIONS BEHAVIOR WITHIN THAT ONE YEAR AFTER THE JUDGMENT IS ENTERED. DAN YOU KNOW CERTAINLY COURT WOULD LOOK AT THAT AS A BIG FACTOR IN COMPLIANCE IN WHETHER IT'S SUBSTANTIAL IS UP TO THE DISCRETION OF THE COURT -- BUT THEY WOULD BE WEIGHING THOSE FACTORS AND THEN I THINK THE SECOND IS THAT THE COURT IN ASSESSING ANY PENALTIES AND I KNOW WE DISCUSSED THIS BRIEFLY WHAT LOOK AT ANY MITIGATING CIRCUMSTANCES -- AND SO DOES COULD BEAT IN TERMS OF THE RESOURCES THE JURISDICTION HAS ANY EXTERNAL EVENTS -- ANY CHANGES THAT ARE HAPPENING THERE SERVING ALL THESE FACTORS WAY INTO WHAT THAT SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE STANDARD IS THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US IN. AS WE'VE ADDRESSED THE HOMELESS SO OVER THE YEARS AND THERE BEEN MANY BILLS THIS IS JUST ANOTHER AND CONTINUE ON IS THERE ANYTHING IN THIS PARTICULAR LEGISLATION. IT WOULD HELP DIRECT THE HOMELESS INDIVIDUAL. TOWARDS RESOURCE NOT JUST THE HOUSING WHERE THEY CAN. LIVE IN RESIDE SLEEP. FIND SHELTER FROM THE STORMS. BUT TO PUT THEMSELVES IN AN EMPLOYABLE CATEGORY SO THEY CAN BE SELF SUFFICIENT. TO DIRECT THEM TOWARDS REHABILITATIVE OPPORTUNITIES WHICH MANY OF THEM NEED ALCOHOL SUBSTANCE ABUSE FOR EXAMPLE. I DON'T SEE MUCH FOCUS ON THE LONG TERM SOLUTION THERE'S NOT JUST TRYING. TO KEEP BUILDING AND BUILDING AND BUILDING TO KEEP UP WITH THE POPULATION OF INCREASING NUMBERS OF HOMELESS BUT IT ALSO HAS TO DELVE INTO. DEALING WITH THE ISSUES THAT CAUSE THOSE INDIVIDUALS TO BE HOMELESS AND HOPEFULLY GET MANY. NOT. TO HAVETO BE IN THAT CLASS OR CHOOSE TO BE IN THAT CLASS. SO I WOULD MAKE TWO POINT YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THAT IT'S NOT SIMPLY ABOUT EXPANDING HOUSING OPTIONS ALTHOUGH THAT IS A BIG PART OF IT AND SO I THINK THERE ARE TWO THINGS THAT THIS. TALE AND THE BROADER BUDGET TO FIRST TO SPECIFICALLY IN THIS BILL. WHEN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WAS RELEASED IN JANUARY IT PROPOSED NOT SIMPLY SHELTERS BUT ALSO NAVIGATION CENTERS AND A FOCUS ON PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING ALL ACROSS THAT SPECTRUM? AND WHAT WE'VE DONE SINCE THEN WORKING WITH AND RECEIVING FEEDBACK FROM MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE IS EXPANDING THE NUMBER OF OPTIONS FOR WHICH THAT MONEY CAN BE USED SO. THAT WE'RE NOT CONTROLLING IT AT THE STATE LEVEL LOCAL JURISDICTIONS WHAT A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY -- BUT THEY KNOW ON THE GROUNDS CLOSEST TO THAT AND WHERE THE NEEDS ARE AND HOW TO MAKE SURE NOT ONLY THAT WE'RE HELPING PEOPLE GET SHELTER BUT THAT WE'RE MOVING AS MANY PEOPLE AS WE CAN INTO PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING AND THEN EVENTUALLY -- IN SOME CASES WITHOUT NEEDING FURTHER STATE SUPPORT SO THERE IS THAT FLEXIBILITY WITHIN THE SIX HUNDRED FIFTY NINE DOLLARS IN THIS BILL AND THEN THE SECOND THING I'LL SAY AND NOT ALL THESE ELEMENTS ARE WITHIN THE SPECIFIC BILL BEFORE YOU -- BUT THE ADMINISTRATION'S BUDGET ALSO INCLUDES A WHOLE PERSON CARE PILOTS AND A NUMBER OF IN A RAPID RE HOUSING EFFORTS AT UC AND CSU INFINITY COLLEGES BECAUSE OF PEOPLE CAN GET HOUSING THERE THEY GET THEIR DEGREE IT'S LESS LIKELY THAT THEY WILL. BE IN HOUSING EMERGENCIES SO I THINK YOU SEE A NUMBER OF EFFORTS WITHIN THE BUDGET INCLUDING ALSO RE ENTRY FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE TRANSITIONING OUT OF A CORRECTIONAL FACILITY. THAT WE THINK ARE REALLY IMPORTANT TO ATTACK THIS ISSUE FROM ALL ANGLES BUT WILL THERE BE ANY LEVEL. OF ASSESSMENT FOR EXAMPLE THE NAVIGATION CENTERS HAVE AN ATTRACTION. THAT TO ME. BUT AT THAT NAVIGATION CENTER WHICH IS A CENTRAL PLACE. WOULD THERE BE ANY ASSESSMENT CAPABILITY AT THAT CENTER WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENT HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY THE RESOURCES THE MEANS THE POWER BUT TO ASSESS THE NEEDS OF THAT INDIVIDUAL. NOT JUST IN TERMS OF WHERE THEY WOULD RESIDE. BUT HOW THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO PROVIDE FOR THEMSELVES. AND FIND RESOURCES FOR THE CHALLENGES THAT THEY FACE WILL THERE BE THOSE OPPORTUNITIES IN THE NAVIGATION CENTERS. I BELIEVE SO BECAUSE WE ARE NOT PRESCRIBING THE FUNDING TO THAT LEVEL OF DETAIL IN STATUTE IN THIS BILL SO I BELIEVE THAT LOCAL JURISDICTIONS WILL HAVE A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY IN MAKING THOSE TYPES OF DETERMINATIONS. WELL IT'S A LITTLE LATE IN THE GAME BUT I WOULD SUGGEST VERBIAGE IN THE BILL. THAT MONEY SHOULD. OR ENCOURAGING LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO FOCUS ON THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL. THIS CALL TO YOUR FOLLOWED BY MISS SKINNER. VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR -- I JUST WANTED -- TO TO THANK YOU FOR THE THE STRUCTURE FOR THAT -- THAT HOUSING ELEMENT COMPLIANCE. AND COURT REMEDIES -- INITIALLY THERE WAS SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT A MUCH MORE ONEROUS PENALTY AT THE END WHICH WOULD ALLOW THE STATE TO COME IN AND TAKE OVER AND I THINK THAT. CREATED SOME ANXIETY FOR MANY OF US WHO COME FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT -- EVEN IF IT WAS NEVER UTILIZE THE FACT THAT IT'S THERE BECOMES A I I THINK A CHALLENGE SINCE LOCAL GOVERNMENT IN THE STATE ALL REPRESENT THE SAME PEOPLE SO I I AM I APPRECIATE THAT THAT. THE STRUCTURE I ALSO APPRECIATE THE ESCALATING NATURE OF THE COMPLIANCE -- PENALTIES BECAUSE WERE REALLY. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE FIRST STEP. IN PLANNING FOR HOUSING WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT WHETHER YOU'RE PRODUCING IT OR NOT THIS IS REALLY THEFIRST STEP WHICH IS THE PLANNING STEP AND SO. ON REALLY DO APPRECIATE THAT AND WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT I I COMMUNICATED THAT THERE ARE MANY OF US THAT ARE THAT ARE -- MUCH HAPPIER WITH THE WAY THAT IT'S BEEN STRUCTURED THIS POINT I SHOULD CLARIFY AN INTEREST OF FULL TANSPARENCY THERE IS AS A LAST RESORT AT THE END OF THIS BILL. THE COURT WITHIN ITS DISCRETION COULD APPOINT AN AGENT OF THE COURT. TO HELP BRING THE JURISDICTION COMPLIANCE BUT AS YOU NOTED IT IS ONLY AFTER A SERIES OF STEPS -- WHERE EVERY EFFORT IS MADE TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE WITH OTHER REMEDIES WELL AND IT'S ALSO IT'S A IT'S A COURT? IT'S A COURT INITIATED PROCESS CORRECT YES AND ED ED. APPOINTED BY THE COURT -- AND SO THAT THE I THINK IS IS FOR FURTHER REMOVES THE STATE FROM THAT WHOLE. THAT WHOLE FRAMEWORK THE SCANNER. THANK YOU I MADAM CHAIR -- I THINK THIS IS A GOOD BILL AND THERE'S MOST ELEMENTS TIME VERY VERY HAPPY WITH. THERE IS ONE CONCERN THAT I HAVE IN IN THE HOMELESSNESS SECTION. WHERE WE PROVIDE THE FUNDING TO THE CITIES? AND THEN TO THE COUNTY AND TO THE CONTINUUM OF CARE. THE LANGUAGE IN -- THE SECTION STARTING WITH -- STARTING WITH PAGE. FORTY FOUR LINES TWENTY FOUR ON IT ADDRESSES -- BEING ABLE. TO DEAL WITH IMMEDIATE HOMELESS CHALLENGES. BUT THEN THE LANGUAGE IN THOSE LINES TWENTY FIVE TWENTY SIX TWENTY SEVEN IS EXPLICIT. OF IT'S VERY SAD NERO THAT IT NEEDS. TO MOVE HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES INTO PERMANENT HOUSING AND SUPPORTING THE F. EFFORTS OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES MEANING THE HOMELESS FAMILIES. SO THEN YOU GO ON TO PAGE. FORTY SIX AND IN OUR LINE FOURTEEN FIFTEEN SIXTEEN IT REFERENCES THAT THE FUNDS CAN BE USED FOR PREVENTION SO THAT WOULD. INDICATE SOMEONE WHO IS NOT YET HOMELESS. BUT THEN I GOES DOWN TO LINES TWENTY SEVEN TWENTY EIGHT TWENTY NINE THIRTY WHICH SEEMED TO REFERENCE. FEDERAL DEFINITIONS WHICH ARE VERY NARROWLY CONSTRUED TO BE ONLY PEOPLE WHO ARE ALREADY HOMELESS OR WITHIN FOURTEEN DAYS OF BECOMING HOMELESS. SO THEN IF WE GO TO PAGE FORTY SEVEN IT INDICATES THAT WE CAN USE THE FUNDS. TO ADDRESS AND PREVENT HOMELESSNESS INCLUDING RENTAL ASSISTANCE. MY CONCERN IS THAT BY THE NARROW DEFINITION. OF THAT YOU HAVE TO BE WITHIN FOURTEEN DAYS OF BEING HOMELESS THAT IT WOULD. RESTRICT THE THE SEEM TO BE CONTRADICTORY. AND IT WOULD ONLY ALLOW. A NEW ENTITY WHO IS APPLYING FOR THESE FUNDS WHO WANTS. TO PROVIDE SUPPORT TO PREVENT A FAMILY FROM BECOMING HOMELESS. TO ONLY PROVIDE THEM THAT SUPPORT IF THEY'RE WITHIN FOURTEEN DAYS. OF BECOMING HOMELESS. MOST FOLKS WHO ARE FACED WITH. EITHER THE POTENTIAL FOR ADDICTION OR EVEN EVICTION NO IT BEFORE FOURTEEN DAYS. AND A WINDOW OF FOURTEEN DAYS IS A VERY SHORT WINDOW TO REALLY. ASSIST. AND PREVENT THEM FROM LOSING THEIR HOME. SO I I ASKED MY STAFF TO TAKE THE BILL TO LEDGE COUNCIL TO SEE. IF MY INTERPRETATION BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT IT AND LEDGE COUNCIL SAYS YES IT SEEMS TO BE CONTRADICTORY OR THEY MAY NOT USE THAT LANGUAGE. BUT RATHER THAT -- THAT CLEAR FINDING LANGUAGE MIGHT BE HELPFUL. AND I REALIZED THAT WE WANT TO PASS TODAY I'M HOPING THAT WE CAN DO SOME CLEAN UP LANGUAGE BECAUSE WHEN I READ THE BILL IT SEEMS VERY CLEAR IN ITS INTENT. THAT WE WANT TO GIVE PEOPLE FLEXIBILITY TO BE ABLE TO USE THE FINDING IF THEY SO CHOOSE TO HELP PREVENT PEOPLE FROM BECOMING HOMELESS. AND WE MAY NEED WHAT WHAT I ASKED LEDGE COUNCIL IS WHAT IS THE SIMPLEST AMENDMENT. THAT COULD MAKE SURE THAT THESE ARE NOT AT ODDS. AND I WANT TO RAISE THIS BECAUSE NOT ONLY BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE. WE HAVE THIS CLEAR INTENT I DON'T WANT IT TO BE CONTRADICTORY BUT EDITION ONLY IF WE LOOK AT THE DATA. FOR THE RISE IN HOMELESSNESS IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS. AND WE'VE SEEN THESE JUNKS. 17% OVER A PERIOD OF A YEAR JUST BETWEEN SEVENTEEN AND EIGHTEEN IN MANY OF OUR JURISDICTIONS THOSE PEOPLE. THE DATA SHOWS. ARE NOT MENTALLY ILL. ARE NOT ADDICTED ADDICTED. MANY HAVE FAMILIES. ALL WERE HOUSED NEVER ON HOUSE PRIOR. ALL HAVE JOBS. SO THESE ARE ALL PEOPLE THAT FALL INTO THAT CATEGORY OF FACING. THAT UNEXPECTED EXPENSE WHICH THEN LED THEM TO GET BEHIND ON RENT POTENTIALLY AND NOW I'M SPECULATING BUT THEY FACED AN UNEXPECTED EXPENSE. FOR THEY FOUND THEMSELVES WERE THERE WHERE THEY WERE LIVING. MAYBE THE PERSON WHOSE NAME WAS ON THE LEASE LAUGHTER HAD TO MOVE IN THEIR NAME WASN'T ON THE LEASE AND SO THEN THEY DIDN'T HAVE PROTECTIONS OR ANY NUMBER OF OTHER THINGS. THAT IF WE CAN INTERVENE. BEFORE. THERE ON THE STREET IS FAR FAR. LESS RESOURCES TO KEEP THE HOUSE AND WE KNOW THAT FOR EXAMPLE THE MAYOR'S THE FOURTEEN MAYORS OF THIRTEEN MAYORS ALL WROTE US A LETTER SAYING THAT THEY WANTED. TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY WOULD HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO USE THIS FOR EMERGENCY RENTAL ASSISTANCE SO I'M BEING VERY CLEAR ABOUT IT NOW. BECAUSE I REALIZED EVERYONE WANTS IS TO OFFER TO PASS IT RIGHT NOW. BUT I WANT THAT CLARIFIED AND I WOULD LOOK FORWARD TO THE LANGUAGE. MAYBE IT'S RIGHT AFTER BREAK ELEMENT THAT WOULD CLEAR ABOUT THE WHAT CLEAR LANGUAGES YOU'RE LOOKING FOR SO -- NO -- TIME PERIOD BEYOND FOURTEEN DAYS I'M HEARING TWO THINGS FROM YOU RIGHT CLARIFICATION ABOUT WHO WOULD APPLIES TO THE THE EXISTING HOMELESS OR THOSE WHO PUT IT THERE WILL BE. HEY AND SEE WHAT MORE FLEXIBILITY FOR THE DOLLARS COULD APPLY TO BOTH CORRECT YES AND THEN THE FOURTEEN DAYS. I WOULD HAVE TO BE MORE IN FOURTEEN DAYS SO. AND WHEN I SAY THAT CLEARLY WE DO WANT WE DON'T WANT IT AVAILABLE TO ANYONE SO. SO OBVIOUSLY THAT HAS TO BE SOME NARROWED YES. AND BUT WE JUST DON'T WANT TO BE BECAUSE OUR ABILITY TO INTERVENE FOR SOMEBODY WHO'S ABOUT TO BE. ON THE STREET IN FOURTEEN DAYS IS THERE A WINDOW YEAH. GOT IT [inaudible] THANK YOU. AND SO WILL HAVE OFFLINE CONVERSATION ABOUT THAT AND I WILL MAKE SURE THAT THAT THAT YOU WERE CLEAR ABOUT WHAT THE SPECIFIC ASK YES. THANK YOU MOVING ON TO SENATOR MCGUIRE FOLLOWED BY SEVEN TO BAIL THEM TO REQUIRE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR HERE MORE THAN WELCOME AND HERE I WAS JUST GONNA ADDRESS AT THE VICE CHAIRS ARE COMMON AND THAT'S IN REGARDS TO THAT. THE HOMELESS FINDS IN THAT PLEASE CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG I BELIEVE THE HOMELESS HOUSING ASSISTANCE PREVENTION PROGRAMS. THE FORMER KEEP FUNDS IT'S THE ONE TIME THE SIX HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION THAT WOULD BE PROGRAMS AND THEY'RE EXTREMELY FLEXIBLE SOLES GONNA SAY SO TOTALLY UP TO THE JURISDICTION ABOUT HOW THEY WANT TO BE IN THIS BAND. THERE ARE -- BENCHMARKS IN THERE ABOUT HOW IT SHOULD BE SPENT BUT IT'S VERY BROAD -- IN ALLOWS UP -- IT UP TO THE JURISDICTION -- WHAT WORKS BEST FOR THE MOST PART SO I I KNOW THERE IS SOME CONCERN AND -- THERE'S A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY IN THAT WAY -- WORKING WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK THAT IS PROVIDED THANKS FOR THE CLARIFICATION CITY TO BAIL. YES -- THANK YOU THANK YOU. FOR THIS LENGTHY DOCUMENT -- I WANTED -- TO ASHU -- IN TERMS OF THE BUDGET HOW MANY HOUSING UNITS WILL THE BILL PROVIDE. DO YOU HAVE A NUMBER. I DON'T BELIEVE WE HAVE AN ESTIMATE FOR THIS BILL BUT I WILL CHECK -- WITH OUR FINEST OKAY WE HAVE IS OUR ONE AND FIND OUT IF YOU HAVE A BASE GOAL. OF YOU KNOW LIKE MEASURING PROGRESS HERE'S HOW MANY UNITS WERE PLANNING. TO ACCOMPLISH WHAT IS THE BASE GOAL OKAY THEN -- THE SEARCH THE AREA THAT I'M SPECIFICALLY CONCERNED ABOUT A JUST SAY THIS. I COULD. IN LOOKING AT THE BILL VERY CAREFULLY THIS MORNING -- THE INCOME CATEGORY. THAT'S KIND OF THE SOFT SPOT ON YOUR BILL OKAY I FEEL LIKE THE HOMELESS PROGRAM WE DID A PRETTY GOOD JOB. WE PASSED THE MAIL PROPOSITION TWO LAST YEAR -- WE WE PUT SUBSTANTIAL FUNDS. IN THIS BILL FOR THE HOMELESS PROGRAMS. WE'RE KEEPING IT FLEXIBLE WHICH WE GIVE IN THOSE CITIES THE COUNTIES -- CONTINUED KERR PROGRAMS OF FUNDS WERE DOING PRETTY GOOD THEN THE THE TAX CREDIT PROGRAM -- THE EIGHTY TO A HUNDRED AND 20% INCOME CATEGORY. WERE REALLY BE FED UP WITH THIS BILL. DID A GOOD JOB ON NOW BUT THE AREA THAT'S A PROBLEM FOR ME. IS THE THERE IS A SCANNER CENTER SCANNER WAS TALKING ABOUT AND THAT'S THE THE AT RISK TO HOMELESS. ALLEGORY. AND I I THINK WE'RE NOT THERE YET ON THIS BILL OKAY. I I I DON'T SEE MUCH EMPHASIS IN THIS BILL ON THAT CATEGORY THAT'S THE THIRTY TWO HUNDRED PER. 13250% -- THAT IT'S BEEN IDENTIFIED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING -- SO ARE HAVING A NEED FOR AS MUCH AS ONE POINT FIVE MILLION UNITS SHORTAGE. AND THESE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE FALLING INTO HOME WAS IN FACT SACRAMENTAL RIGHT HERE. LAST YEAR JUST NEAR YOUR ONE YEAR THE YEAR WAS 19% INCREASE. AND WE'RE GETTING SIMILAR NUMBERS IN LOS ANGELES SAN JOSE SAN FRANCISCO ALL THE COMMUNITIES ARE HAVING THESE -- INCREASES. IN THE HOMELESS AND IT'S THE PEOPLE IN THIS CATEGORY. THAT ARE FALLING INTO HOMELESS AND THE QUESTION AS OF DO YOU AGREE THAT WE SHOULD FOLLOW UP WITH THIS BILL. IN STUDYING WHAT WE COULD DO WITH THAT CATEGORY WE NEED TO WE NEED. TO FOLLOW UP. AND DEAL WITH THAT PARTICULAR AREA OR ELSE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE -- MMHM WAY MORE HOMELESS SO PEOPLE. YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR AND WE'RE GONNA KEEP FALLING BEHIND. OF IT EVERY YEAR IN TERMS OF TOTAL NUMBER OF HOMELESS PEOPLE THAT WE HAVE IN IN CALIFORNIA. AND YOU KNOW YOU KNOW I THINK WE'RE DEALING WITH THE HOME WAS THAT WE HAVE NOW GOOD BUT WHAT I THINK WE'RE NOT RECOGNIZING THAT WE'RE HAVING A TREND HERE. THAT'S REALLY A BAD TREND IT'S IT'S DANGEROUSLY BAD. OF AND PART OF IT'S BECAUSE BY THINGS LIKE THE THE CANCELLATION OF THE DEED RESTRICTIONS THAT. FEDERALLY SUBSIDIZED HOUSING UNITS. HAVE. IN TERMS OF THE DEED RESTRICTIONS THE THAT WERE PLACED ON THE GENEROUS LIKE. THIRTY FORTY FIFTY YEARS AGO THAT ARE NOW EXPIRING. AND SO NOW THESE UNITS ARE BEING PRICED AT A MARKET RATE THE RENTS ARE RIGHT RISEN -- THE THE THE INCREASE WITH THE FAILURE OF OF ANY KIND OF RENT CONTROL OR IN WRITTEN RENT ISSUES. HAS REALLY CAUSED. A LARGE NUMBER OF RANTS TO GO UP WHICH PUTS PUSHES PEOPLE OUT OF THEIR UNITS. QUITE FRANKLY -- THAT'S THE CONSEQUENCE -- WE KNOW THIS IS HAPPENING. AND WE'RE SEEING THE NUMBERS THE ALMOST COUNTS ARE JUST GOING UP SPEC YOU KNOW JUST. IN A IN A IN A CRISIS MODE MANNER -- BUT IN THE BUDGET HERE. THIS TRAILER BILL DOESN'T RECOGNIZE. OF THAT PARTICULAR FOR THAT PARTICULAR. CATEGORY I HONESTLY IT DOESN'T. I MEAN IF YOU LOOK AT IT FROM A TRUE STANDPOINT IT REALLY DOESN'T SO CAN YOU CAN YOU OUT. IF YOU COULD COMMENT ABOUT WHAT WE HAVE TO DO NEXT. YOU KNOW IF WE'RE GOING TO ADOPT THIS THIS IS KIND OF A HALF HALF THE GAME. BUT I THINK WE HAVE TO ADDRESS THIS [inaudible] CRISIS CATEGORY THAT WE HAVE CAN YOU ADDRESS THAT WHAT THE INTENTION OF THE THE GOVERNOR THIS IS A ONE TIME BUDGET MAINLY. COULD YOU ADDRESS CAN YOU DRESS WHAT WHAT COMES NEXT SIR WHAT WE'RE GOING TO BE LOOKED AT IN THE FUTURE. TO ADDRESS THESE THIS CRITICAL CRISIS THAT WE HAVE. YES TELL MAKE TWO POINTS THANK YOU FOR THAT I THINK THE FIRST IS THAT YOU ARE RIGHT THAT A NUMBER OF THESE PROGRAMS -- FOLLOW A BROADER MORE MIXED INCOME YOU KNOW UP TO A 120% AREA MEDIAN INCOME -- PERCENTAGE -- AND WHEN IT COMES SPECIFICALLY THOUGH TO THE FOCUSED -- THAT YOU MENTIONED WE DO BELIEVE THAT A PART OF OUR EXPANSION OF THE LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDIT -- MAKES A DIFFERENCE THERE AND I WILL SAY ABOUT THAT PART OF THE PACKAGE WHERE AS MOST OF THE OTHER ITEMS WITH REGARD TO SPENDING IN THIS BILL ARE ONE TIME. THAT IS AN ON GOING OUT LOCATION DATA FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS WHICH IS SPLIT BUT PART OF THAT REALLY IS FOCUSED ON EXPANDING THAT 4% TAX CREDIT AND MAKING SURE IT GETS. TO THOSE FAMILIES BUT ON THE BROADER POINT AT YOU ARE CORRECT THAT. THE GOVERNOR DOESN'T BELIEVE THAT THIS ONE BILL BY ITSELF WILL SOLVE THE ISSUE AND HE KNOWS THAT THERE'S SO MUCH MORE TO DO SO HE NEED MINISTRATION ARE DEFINITELY LOOKING LATER IN THE SESSION OVER THE UPCOMING YEAR. TO CONTINUE TO SEE WHAT MORE WE CAN DO IN THIS AREA THERE IS A RECOGNITION THAT THIS CATEGORY THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. IS THE SOFT SPOT IN THIS. TRADE HOUSING TRAILER BILL. IT'S A SOFT SPOT YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT THE TAX CREDITS I THINK IT WAS. TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OF THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION CORRECT. WELL THAT'S THAT'S NICE BUT IT'S NOT. IT'S NOT GOING TO PLUG THE DIET OF THE RISE IN HOMELESSNESS SETS. NICE BUT IT'S IT'S NOT GOING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM. THEY CERTAINLY MORE TO DO THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT. I THINK THERE'S A PACKAGE OF BILLS GOING TO THE ROCESS ALSO SERVED A BILL THAT I HOPE THAT THE LEGISLATURE WILL -- HOPEFULLY TAKE ACTUALLY GET TO THE GOVERNOR'S DESK YEAH I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THE RENT CONTROL. BILLS THAT DIED. ARE GOING TO HAVE A VERY BAD EFFECT OVER THE NEXT YEAR. MY OPINION AND SO YOU'RE THE YOU'RE PREACHING TO THE CHOIR HERE SIR. SENATOR JONES. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN -- THIS IS BEEN AN INTERESTING I'VE LEARNED TWO THINGS TODAY -- AS A AS A NEW CENTER RIGHT AND LEARNED EARLIER THAT THE CS YOU HAS TO COME TO THE LEGISLATURE TO GET PERMISSION. TO EXPAND THEIR DOCTOR PROGRAMS I DIDN'T KNOW THAT AS A CS YOU GRAD. AND THE SECOND THING I'VE LEARNED TODAY -- IN A SOONER MORE LIKE ALLUDED TO IT IS THE MARIN COUNTY ISSUE -- AND I JUST WANTED. TO KIND OF FOR THE OTHER NEW SENATORS THAT MAYBE ARE FAMILIAR WITH IT I WAS INTRIGUED BY THIS AND I'VE GOT A ARTICLEFROM LAST YEAR BY DAN WALTERS. AND THE HEADLINE IS MARIN COUNTY GETS ANOTHER SMUG REPRIEVE. FROM HOUSING QUOTAS -- AND WHEN I READ THIS EARLIER TODAY. THERE WAS A PARTICULAR QUOTE -- THAT'S JUMPED OUT AT ME. S. ON THE SECOND PAGE IS HOWEVER WITHOUT WAITING FOR A SCHEDULED REPORT ON THE COUNTY'S PROGRESS ON MEETING ITS HOUSING QUOTAS. THIS FAMILY MEMBER FROM MARIN PERSUADED LEGISLATIVE LEADERS LAST MONTH. TO INSERT A MEMBER THIS IS LAST YEAR -- LEADERS LAST MONTH TO INSERT INTO A BUDGET TRAILER BILL SENATE BILL. ONE OH SIX A BRIEF PASSAGE THAT EXTENDS MARIN COUNTY'S EXEMPTION. FROM QUOTAS FOR AN ADDITIONAL FIVE YEARS UNTIL. TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT BY BEING ATTACHED TO A TRAILER BILL. THAT CONTAINED MANY OTHER PROVISIONS -- RATHER THEN OFFERED AS A STAND ALONE POLICY MATTER. THE MARIN EXEMPTIONS DID A MUCH BETTER CHANCE AND IS ONE OF MANY EXAMPLES OF HOW TRAILER BILLS ARE BLANK. MISUSED. AS FOR IN COURT ON THAT IT'S COUPLE PARAGRAPHS LONG -- THE ENTIRE ARTICLE AS ONE IF THE NEW GUY AND GOVERNOR BROWN SIGNED THAT BILL. AND I'M WONDERING IF THE NEW GOVERNOR HAS ANY OF AS A PINT ON THE MARIN COUNTY ISSUE AND AS YOU'VE ALREADY ANSWER CENTER MORLOCK THIS PARTICULAR BILL DOESN'T ADDRESS IT BUT ARE WE GONNA SEE SOME. PARITY BETWEEN THE FIFTY SEVEN OTHER COUNTIES. AND MARIN COUNTY WHEN IT COMES TO THESE HOUSING QUOTAS AND THE REQUIREMENTS THAT THE IN AND AND I THINK AS RIGHTLY HAS BEEN SHARED. BY A LOT OF PEOPLE ON THIS DIET ALL OF OUR COUNTIES. WANT TO ARE TRYING TO BE HELPFUL -- SOMERS WARRANTS IN IF THE NEW GOVERNOR HAS A HAS A HAS OPINED ON THIS OR IF THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE MIGHT HAVE AN OPINION. SO I CAN'T SPEAK TO THAT DIRECTLY AS YOU MENTIONED IT WAS IT IN A PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION CERTAINLY AS PART OF REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT PROCESS -- WORKING BEING STAKEHOLDERS OVER THE NEXT COUPLE YEARS TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT PROCESS IS WORKING AS WELL AS POSSIBLE BY ON THAT SPECIFIC ISSUE. DON'T REALLY HAVE ANYTHING TO REPORT BEYOND WHAT'S IN THE BILL BEFORE YOU TODAY I I THINK SOME OF THE HOUSING ADVOCATES FROM LAST YEAR AND I KNOW THERE'S EVEN A GREAT QUOTE IN THIS ARTICLE FROM. CENTER NAILS AND I THINK HE DID A GOOD JOB OF ANSWERING TO THE TO THE CONCERN BUT I WOULD HOPE THE TEN THE GOVERNORS -- WOULD LISTEN IN THOSE HOUSING ADVOCATES AND AND TAKE THEIR CONCERNS -- AT UNDER CAN SPOT CONSIDERATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU BEFORE WE DOUBLED BACK TO SEVEN TO REQUIRE IF ANYONE ELSE WHO HASN'T PULLED THE QUESTION YET HAVE -- ONE C. NINE SIR TO REQUIRE FOLLOWED BY MORE LOCK TO REQUIRE THANK YOU SO MUCH AT MADAM CHAIR AND I'LL BE VERY BRIEF. LOOK I I GET THAT MARIN COUNTY IS A IS A FINE PUNCHING BAG FOR MANY IN THIS LEGISLATURE BUT I'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO CLARIFY WHAT EXACTLY WAS IN THE BUDGET. HERE AT THREE YEARS AGO. NUMBER ONE THERE IS NO EXEMPTION IS BASED OFF OF DENSITY SO MARIN COUNTY WAS LABELED AS AN URBAN COUNTY IT IS TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND FOLKS. TO A FIFTY THOUSAND TOTAL POPULATION. SO WHAT THE BUDGET DID IT WAS BASED OFF A DENSITY HOW MANY HOURS PER ACRE. THE COUNTY WILL BUILD IN THE CITIES WITHIN THE COUNTY WOULD BUILD. SO RATHER THAN LABELING. MARIN COUNTY AS URBAN. IT WAS RE CATEGORIES TO SUBURBAN. GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF A SUBURBAN COUNTY CINEMA WITH. FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND SAN MATTEO WAS. SIX HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND AGAIN I'D LIKE TO REPEAT BRING COUNTY HAS TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE. THEY ARE CHARACTERIZED AS IN FORMALLY. IN IN THE LAW AS URBAN. SO WHAT THE BILL DID. EIGHT TRANSITION FROM AN URBAN OUNTY TO SUBURBAN COUNTY THERE WAS NO EXEMPTION THANKS DAVID THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THE CLARIFICATION PRESHEAF THAT CENTER MORE LAW. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I KNOW THAT IT'S DIFFICULT TO DISCUSS ONGOING LITIGATION -- BUT WE'VE ALREADY. MADE AN EXAMPLE OF THE CITY OF HUNTINGTON BEACH AND I'M JUST KIND OF CURIOUS NOW THAT YOU HAVE A PROCESS FORMAL PROCESS THAT YOU'RE. PROPOSING -- DO YOU -- INTEND TO CONTINUE WITH THIS CASE -- OR DO YOU PLAN ON REBOOTING AND TREATING THEM THE SAME AS AS THE PROPOSED POLICY. SO I CANNOT DISCUSS ONGOING LITIGATION AS YOU -- PRESUMED -- I WILL SAY YOU KNOW WHAT -- EVEN WITH THAT LAWSUIT WHEN THAT LAWSUIT WAS FILED -- THE GOVERNOR MADE IT CLEAR THAT I BELIEVE WAS FOR IT WAS MORE THAN FORTY JURISDICTIONS THAT WEREN'T CURRENTLY IN COMPLIANCE. HIS GOAL BEING RESTRICTIONS GOALS NOT TO FILE A BUNCH OF LAWSUITS IT'S TO BRING THESE JURISDICTIONS INTO COMPLIANCE AND UNDER THE PROCESS OUTLINED IN THIS BILL. IF THE COURT DETERMINES THAT TO SENATOR STERN'S POINT THAT -- THE JURISDICTION IS IN SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE DAN AND NONE OF THESE REMEDIES WILL APPLY AFTER THAT FACT. SO. THIS PROCESS THIS BILL BEFORE YOU MAKE SOME CHANGES TO THE REMEDIES -- BUT THE UNDERLYING LAW THAT WE HOPE AND EXPECT JURISDICTIONS TO COMPLY WITH THE STILL THE SAME. I BELIEVE THAT TO THE READER REQUIREMENTS FOR HUNTINGTON BEACH WERE IN THE MID THIRTEEN HUNDREDS AND THEY HAD ALREADY. CONSTRUCTED SOME NINE HUNDRED UNITS THAT THAT KIND OF PUT THEM SOMEWHERE. ALONG THE WAY. THE CITY NEXT DOOR ONLY REQUIRES EIGHTY SIX UNITS FOR COMPLIANCE FARINA. SO THE THIRD RING INTERESTING DISPARITIES ARE I JUST WANT TO BRING THAT UP FOR THE RECORD THAT WE'VE GOT TO SEE THAT ACTUALLY. HAS HAS SOME MOVEMENT IN IN TRYING TO COMPLY.
