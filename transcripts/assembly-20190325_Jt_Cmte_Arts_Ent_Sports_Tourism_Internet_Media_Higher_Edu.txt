COMMITTEE CHAIR -- WILL GIVE US SOME BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND AND IN CONTACT SO PLEASE -- WELCOME. GOOD AFTERNOON. I'M SO USED TO BEING ABLE TO TALK SORT OF A AT GENDER FAIRNESS FOR ALL POSITION IN ALL OF THE WORK THAT WE UNDERTAKE. DESPITE PROGRESS CHALLENGES TO GENDER EQUITY IN EDUCATION STILL EXISTS AND I AM PLEASED TO SHARE A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF GENDER EQUITY LAWS. AND WHAT WORK STILL NEEDS TO BE DONE TO LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD. WHEN I WAS A CLASSROOM TEACHER MIGHT? THEME WAS EDUCATION IS NOT A SPECTATOR SPORT GET OFF OF THE BENCH AND INTO THE GAME. IN NINETEEN SIXTY THREE THE U. S. COMMISSION ON THE STATUS OF WOMEN ISSUED A REPORT DOCUMENTING THE SECONDARY STATUS OF WOMEN IN THE UNITED STATES WITH A SPECIAL FOCUS. ON WOMEN'S ECONOMIC DISADVANTAGES ONE OF THE RESULTS OF THAT STUDY WAS THE EQUAL PAY ACT OF NINETEEN SIXTY THREE THE CIVIL RIGHTS CIVIL RIGHTS ACT OF NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR WAS THE NATION'S PREMIER CIVIL RIGHTS LEGISLATION. THE ACT OUTLAWED DISCRIMINATION ON THE BASIS OF RACE COLOR RELIGION SEX OR NATIONAL ORIGIN REQUIRED EQUAL ACCESS TO PUBLIC PLACES AND EMPLOYMENT. AND ENFORCE DESEGREGATION OF SCHOOLS. THE PROTECTIONS BASED ON SEX HOWEVER WERE NOT FULLY REALIZED UNDER THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT THEREFORE IN RESPONSE TO PUBLIC PRESSURE FOR SEX EQUITY IN SCHOOL. TITLE NINE WAS SPONSORED BY A YOU W. MEMBER REPRESENTATIVE PATSY MINK OF HAWAII AND SENATORS BIRCH BY AND GEORGE MCGOVERN. A A YOU W. BECAME AN IMPORTANT VOICE IN THE COALITION WORK THAT SUCCESSFULLY PROMOTED THE PASSAGE OF TITLE. NINE PRESIDENT NIXON SIGNED THE EDUCATION AMENDMENTS OF SEVENTY TWO IN JUNE AND IT BECAME EFFECTIVE JULY. ONE NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO TITLE NINE SIMPLY STATES NO PERSON IN THE UNITED STATES SHALL ON THE BASIS OF SEX BE EXCLUDED FROM PARTICIPATION IN. BE NOT DENIED THE BENEFITS OF OR BE SUBJECTED TO DISCRIMINATION UNDER ANY EDUCATION PROGRAM OR ACTIVITY RECEIVING FEDERAL FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. COURT ORDERED BUSING WAS MORE VISIBLE MORE CONTROVERSIAL THAN BANNING SEX DISCRIMINATION IN SCHOOLS. TO A LARGE EXTENT TITLE NINE DID NOT GARNER ATTENTION FROM ANYONE UNTIL IT WAS ALREADY LAW AND THEN OPPONENTS BEGAN EFFORTS TO WEAKEN THE IMPACT OF TITLE. NINE THE LARGEST LOBBYING CAMPAIGN AGAINST TITLE NINE CAME FROM THE NATIONAL COLLEGIATE ATHLETIC ASSOCIATION THEY ARGUE THAT OF COLLEGES HAD TO FUND WOMEN'S ATHLETICS MORE THAN THEY WERE ALREADY DOING. THEN TITLE NINE WOULD ESSENTIALLY DESTROY MAJOR COLLEGE FOOTBALL AND BASKETBALL PROGRAMS AT A TIME WHEN WOMEN'S ATHLETIC PROGRAMS AND MOUNTED. TO ABOUT 2% OF TOTAL COLLEGIATE ATHLETIC BUDGETS. THE TITLE NINE REGULATIONS WERE NOT A TOP PRIORITY FOR DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH EDUCATION AND WELFARE. THE REGULATIONS BECAME EFFECTIVE ON JULY. TWENTY ONE NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE THE OFFICE FOR CIVIL RIGHTS WAS CHARGED WITH THE ENFORCEMENT OF TITLE NINE BUT WITHOUT THREATS OF LOST FINANCIAL AID SCHOOL DISTRICTS COLLEGES. AND UNIVERSITIES SIMPLY HAVE CHOSEN NOT TO ENFORCE THE REGULATIONS THIS PRACTICE CONTINUES TODAY AND IT IS MOSTLY THROUGH LAWSUITS THAT ANY PROGRESS IN COMPLIANCE HAS BEEN MADE ONE CASE AT A TIME. THE ENACTMENT OF TITLE NINE HAS BEEN SUPPORTED IN CALIFORNIA BY ACTIONS TAKEN THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS. STARTING IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX WHEN THE FIRST PIECE OF THE GENDER EQUITY LAWS WERE ENACTED. IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO EDUCATION CODE ADDED THE SEX EQUITY AND EDUCATION ACT PROVIDING STATUTORY FRAMEWORK TO ADDRESS GENDER DISCRIMINATION. IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR DE FINISH OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT NINETY TWO ADDED THE UNIFORM COMPLAINT PROCEDURES NINETY THREE GROUNDS FOR SUSPENSION AND EXPULSION FOR ACTS OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT WERE AT IT. ALSO IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT WRITTEN POLICIES ON SEXUAL HARASSMENT. THE CURRENT HIGHER EDUCATION PORTION IS IN THE EQUITY IN THE HIGHER EDUCATION ACT WHICH INCLUDES THE SEX EQUITY IN EDUCATION. IN NINETEEN NINETY THREE ASSEMBLY WOMAN JACKIE SPEAR INTRODUCED AB FOURTEEN SEVENTY SIX TO ADD GENDER EQUITY TO THE COORDINATED COMPLIANCE REVIEW PROCESS CONDUCTED FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS. RECEIVING STATE FUNDING IT INCLUDES LANGUAGE THAT IT ONLY IS REQUIRED TO BE IMPLEMENTED WHEN SUFFICIENT FUNDS HAVE BEEN APPROPRIATED WITHOUT ANY FUNDING THE ON SITE REVIEWS WERE LIMITED TO TWENTY PER YEAR. AND AT THAT RATE WE WOULD NEVER REALIZE FULL ENFORCEMENT OF THESE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS. I WAS HIRED BY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT THE PROVISIONS OF AB. FOURTEEN SEVENTY SIX I WORKED WITH LEGAL COUNSEL TO DEVELOP THE FIRST SEVEN TO EIGHT YEARS OF THE COMPLIANCE PROGRAM. THE PROCESS INCLUDES THREE HOUR TRAINING SESSIONS FOR RESPONSIBLE STAFF PRIOR TO THE ONSITE REVIEW. I STARTED CONDUCTING THESE REVIEWS TWENTY TWO YEARS AFTER THE PASSAGE OF TITLE. NINE THERE WERE MULTIPLE NON COMPLIANT FINDINGS FOR ALMOST ALL SCHOOL DISTRICTS THERE WERE MANY SCHOOLS THAT STILL HAD GENDER SEGREGATED PHYSICAL EDUCATION CLASSES. DURING ONE COMPLIANCE REVIEW A MIDDLE SCHOOL PRINCIPAL KEPT SAYING YOU'RE GOING OUT TO P. E. RIGHT. HE KNEW THAT SINGLE SEX OF P. CLASSES WERE WRONG BUT HE WANTED ME TO FORCE THE CHANGE FROM MY COMPLIANCE REVIEW. TITLE NINE COORDINATOR'S DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO DO THEIR JOBS AND DIDN'T FEEL EMPOWERED TO DO THEIR JOBS THE STATE AND FEDERAL LEGAL PROVISIONS WERE NOT BEING IMPLEMENTED. AFTER I LEFT THAT POSITION THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION COMBINED THE SEX EQUITY IN EDUCATION ACT WITH OTHER DISCRIMINATION PIECES AND NOW. IT IS LOCATED IN AN EDUCATIONAL EQUITY SECTION I HAVE GREAT CONCERNS ABOUT THIS SINCE THE PROTECTIONS BASED ON GENDER ARE NOW SURROUNDED BY ALL OF THE OTHER DISCRIMINATION ISSUES. EVEN WHEN GENDER EQUITY PROVISIONS SAT ALONE GENDER EQUITY HAD NOT BEEN ACHIEVED OR MAINTAINED IN MOST OF CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS. IN ADDITION THE ON SITE REVIEWS HAVE BASICALLY BEEN REPLACED WITH DOCUMENT REVIEWS WEAKENING THE PREVIOUS COMPLIANCE PROCESS. THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ON SITE REVIEWS THAT WE CREATED. BACK IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR TO WHAT IS BEING PROVIDED BY CD E. NOW WITH DOCUMENT COMPLIANCE. ASSUMPTIONS AND ATTITUDES THAT PEOPLE HOLD ABOUT APPROPRIATE FEMALE AND MALE ROLES JOBS AND BEHAVIORS CANNOT BE CHANGED BY LAW. BUT THE RIGHTS PRIVILEGES OPPORTUNITIES AND TREATMENT CAN AND SHOULD BE EQUALIZED WHEN GENDER STEREOTYPES GUIDE EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMMING DISCRIMINATION IS AT THE PROGRAM'S ROUTE. DISCRIMINATION CAN PLAY OUT IN PRACTICES THAT VIOLATE STUDENTS CIVIL RIGHTS WE ARE ALL INDIVIDUALS AND LEARN IN DIFFERENT WAYS IT IS INCORRECT TO BELIEVE THE IDEA THAT THERE ARE HARD WIRED DIFFERENCES. BETWEEN BOYS AND GIRLS BRAINS. EVERY STUDENT LEARNS BETTER WHEN THE TEACHER USES DIFFERENT STRATEGIES AND METHODS TO ENSURE THAT EACH CHILD IN THE CLASSROOM AS A FAIR CHANCE TO SUCCEED. EQUITABLE TREATMENT OF ALL MALE AND FEMALE STUDENTS FROM PRESCHOOL THROUGH UNIVERSITY WILL INCREASE FULFILLMENT OF INDIVIDUAL POTENTIAL. AS INDIVIDUALS EXPLORE NEW OPPORTUNITIES TO EXPRESS THEIR TALENTS. THE TRADITIONAL STEREOTYPES BREAK DOWN AND CHANGE BASIC ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT GENDER APPROPRIATE ROLES JOBS AND BEHAVIORS. THERE TRAINS THAT HAVE THEM HAD THE MOST POSITIVE IMPACT ON MY TEACHING. WAS CALLED GENDER ETHNIC EXPECTATIONS FOR STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT IT OPENED MY AYE AYES TO GENDER FAIRNESS AND CHANGE MY CLASSROOM PRACTICES SO THAT I COULD CREATE CLASSROOMS FREE OF BIAS. I'M A STRONG PROPONENT OF TRAINING TEACHERS TO CONDUCT THEIR CLASSROOMS FREE FROM BIAS RATHER THAN TURNING BACK TO SINGLE GENDER CLASSES AND SCHOOLS. IT IS NOW FORTY SEVEN YEARS SINCE TITLE NINE REGULATIONS WERE IMPLEMENTED WHAT STILL NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED FOR ME ITS ONGOING EDUCATION. TRAININGS AND ENFORCEMENT RECOMMENDATION. ONE IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTY NINE NO EIGHT ADDED SECTION TWO TO FOUR POINT FIVE TO THE CALIFORNIA EDUCATION COLD. TRAIN THE TRAINERS GRANT PROGRAM THE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION SHALL AWARD GRANTS FROM FUNDS AVAILABLE FOR THE PURPOSE. FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF PROGRAMS TO TRAIN TRAINERS AND GENDER EQUITY THE WOULD PROVIDE ONGOING GENDER TRAIN TO ALL STAFF MEMBERS INCLUDING CERTIFICATED IN CLASSIFIED. AND MAINTAINING A POOL OF KNOWLEDGEABLE GENDER EQUITY TRAINERS. AND EDUCATED STAFF WILL PROVIDE A MORE FAIR AND EQUITABLE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT FOR ALL STUDENTS THE PROVISIONS OF AB NINE OH EIGHT MUST BE FUNDED EVERY YEAR. WHEN THIS TITLE NINE AT FORTY FIVE WAS PRODUCED BY THE NATIONAL COALITION COALITION FOR WOMEN AND GIRLS IN EDUCATION IT WAS BEFORE BETSY DEVICE WAS APPOINTED EDUCATION SECRETARY? AS YOU REVIEW THE FULL REPORT PLEASE KEEP IN MIND THAT ON SEPTEMBER TWENTY SECOND TWENTY SEVENTEEN DEVICE HAD THE DEPARTMENT RISKS IN MOST ALL PREVIOUS SEXUAL HARASSMENT GUIDANCE DOCUMENTS. THE ONLY DOCUMENT THAT SHE COULD NOT RE STAN WAS THE TWO THOUSAND AND ONE REVISED SEXUAL HARASSMENT GUIDANCE. THESE PREVIOUS DOCUMENTS PROVIDE MUCH NEEDED CLARIFICATION FOR PREVENTING AND ADDRESSING TITLE NINE ISSUES ON OUR VALUABLE TO LOSE TOOLS. THE NEW PROPOSED FEDERAL REGULATIONS WILL REMOVE THE SUGGESTED SIXTY DAYTIME FRAME TO COMPLETE TITLE NINE INVESTIGATIONS. IT NO LONGER WOULD REQUIRE AN EVIDENTIARY HEARING TO ALLOW FOR INFORMAL RESOLUTION INCLUDING MEDIATION. FOR INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION THE RECIPIENTS GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE MUST PROVIDE FOR A LIFE HEARING WHERE THE WHERE THE DECISION MAKER MUST. PERMIT EACH PARTY TO ASK THE OTHER PARTY AND THEIR WITNESSES ALL WROTE RELEVANT QUESTIONS INCLUDING CHALLENGING AND CREDIBILITY WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR WOMEN AND GIRLS. THERE IS ALREADY A HUGE UNDER REPORTING OF SEXUAL. HARASSMENT RAPE AND OTHER SEX BASED DISCRIMINATION AND THIS PROVISION WILL PRETTY MUCH GUARANTEE THAT VICTIMS WILL NOT COME FORWARD MAKE NO MISTAKE DEVICES ACTIONS AMOUNT TO A BLATANT ROLL BACK. OF STRONG AND NECESSARY PROTECTIONS FOR STUDENTS SURVIVORS RECOMMENDATION TO A A YOU W. STRONGLY SUPPORTS SP FOUR NINETY THREE INTRODUCED BY HANNAH BETH SENATOR HANNAH BETH JACKSON. ON FEBRUARY TWENTY FIRST TWENTY NINETEEN THIS COMPREHENSIVE BILL PROVIDES THE PROTECTIONS FOR VICTIMS OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND ASSAULT THAT WILL BE NEEDED FOR INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION. THAT RECEIVE STATE FUNDS THE STATE BILL SPECIFICALLY PROVIDES FOR STUDENTS TO NOT BE SUBJECTED TO ANY FORM OF DIRECT LIFE CROSS EXAMINATION FROM THE ACCUSED SIDE. RECOMMENDATION THREE IT IS IMPORTANT TO REVIEW THE SEXUAL HARASSMENT PROTECTIONS AN AD CODE FOR STUDENTS IN K.. TWELVE TO SEE IF NEW LEGISLATION IS NEEDED TO STRENGTHEN THOSE PROTECTIONS. EVERY DISTRICT COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY IS REQUIRED TO HAVE AT LEAST ONE TITLE NINE COORDINATOR THAT PERSON MUST BE FULLY TRAINED AND SUPPORTED TO FULFILL THE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS. THE ROLE OF TITLE NINE COORDINATOR'S COMPLEX AND SHOULD BE A FULL TIME POSITION UNDER A DISTRICT OR SCHOOL. SO THEY CAN MAINTAIN COMPLIANCE. ACT EMENDATION FOR I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT IN CALIFORNIA TO CHANGE THE NAME FROM TITLE NINE COORDINATOR TO THE GENDER EQUITY COORDINATOR. TO BE SURE THAT STATE LAWS AND REGULATIONS ARE NOT OVERLOOKED. RECOMMENDATION FIVE ALL TITLE NINE GENDER EQUITY COORDINATORS MUST BE CONSIDERED AS LEADERS AND COLLABORATORS AND BE PROACTIVE GENDER EQUITY ADMINISTRATORS FOR THEIR STUDENTS AND TEACHERS. THEY MUST HAVE THE EXPERTISE AUTHORITY ON TIME BUILT INTO THEIR WORK SCHEDULE TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH ALL ASPECTS. OF QUALITY PLAN TO ADDRESS GENDER FAIRNESS IS TO CREATE TEAMS OF GENDER EQUITY COORDINATORS WITH EXPERTISE IN DIFFERENT AREAS. THE SENATE IS A BRANCH OF A A YOU W. AS A TITLE NINE FOCUS GROUP AND HAS BEEN HOSTING TITLE NINE COORDINATOR'S ROUNDTABLE CALLS. THEY INVITE ALL TITLE NINE COORDINATORS FOR SANTA CLARA COUNTY TO ATTEND. EACH OF THE ROUND TABLE CALLS HAS A PRESENTER THAT HAS EXPERTISE IN TITLE NINE WHETHER PRACTITIONERS OR ATTORNEYS. TO ENSURE STUDENT SUCCESS IN COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITIES WE MUST BEGIN AND CONTINUE FROM PRESCHOOL THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATING ALL STUDENTS ON THEIR RIGHTS. THERE'S A REAL CONTINUE ON HERE IN EQUITY IN SCHOOLS MUST BEGIN WITH THE YOUNGEST OF CHILDREN ALL STUDENTS MUST LEARN TO RESPECT. EACH PERSON AS AN INDIVIDUAL NOT AS A FEMALE OR A MALE. SO WE CAN PROTECT ALL CHILDREN FROM DISCRIMINATION HARASSMENT OKAY [inaudible] OKAY -- IF I GIVE IT. TO GREAT THANK YOU MISS THAT MAN I WANNA I'M AT THIS POINT ALSO RECOGNIZE ASSEMBLY MEMBER RICHARD BLOOM I'M TO THIS JOINT HEARING -- AND IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING YOU WOULD LIKE TO SAY OR IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FOR MS HAT -- SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY -- NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL LARA FAIR OF THE BUREAU OF CHILDREN'S JUSTICE. IN THE CIVIL RIGHTS ENFORCEMENT SECTION WITHIN THE OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. SHE HAS THE DISTINCTION OF BEING THE FORMER REGIONAL DIRECTOR FOR THE FEDERAL OFFICE OF CIVIL RIGHTS WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. RESPONSIBLE FOR OVERSEEING CIVIL RIGHTS COMPLIANCE IN CALIFORNIA AND IS RATHER UNIQUELY QUALIFIED TO SPEAK ON TODAY'S TOPIC -- SO WITH THAT I INVITE YOU -- TO SHARE YOUR TESTIMONY AND I ASK THAT YOU LOOK UP FROM TIME TO TIME -- AT OUR TIME KEEPER ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU SO MUCH. GOOD AFTERNOON COMMITTEE IN CHAIRS. ON BEHALF OF ATTORNEY GENERAL HAVE YOU EVER SAID I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS ADDRESSING GENDER EQUITY IN OUR SCHOOLS. COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITY. THIS IS AN AREA OF INCREDIBLE IMPORTANCE TO ATTORNEY GENERAL ETCETERA. AS WE GET INTO THE SPECIFICS I WILL DISCUSS SOME OF THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE WORK IN THIS AREA. AND BECAUSE OF TITLE NINE STEPS AND BRATS AND AS YOU JUST HEARD THE SIMILAR DEPTH AND BREADTH OF CALIFORNIA'S ANTI DISCRIMINATION LAWS INCLUDING THE SEX EQUITY IN EDUCATION ACT. MY COMMENTS TODAY WILL ADDRESS ONLY SOME OF THE TOPICS THAT THESE LAWS COVER. SPECIFICALLY I WILL BE TOUCHING ON CHANGES BOTH PROPOSED AND IMPLEMENTED AND HOW TITLE NINE IS INTERPRETED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AND THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN CALIFORNIA LAW AND FEDERAL LAW WITH RESPECT TO SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND VIOLENCE. AND ALSO DOMESTIC AND DATING VIOLENCE IN STOCK IN OUR SCHOOLS. THE DEFINITION OF SEX AND ITS IMPORTANCE. APPLICATION OF THE LAW TO EQUITY IN ATHLETICS AND FINALLY THE SCOPE OF THE LOST COVERAGE FOR OUR STUDENTS AND STAFF WHO ARE TRAVELING AND WORKING ABROAD. LET ME BEGIN BY PROVIDING SOME BACKGROUND ON FEDERAL TITLE NINE AS YOU HEARD TITLE NINE MANDATES THAT NO STUDENT SHALL ON THE BASIS OF SEX BE DISCRIMINATED AGAINST. IN AN EDUCATION PROGRAM OR ACTIVITY THAT RECEIVES FEDERAL EDUCATION FUNDING. THE US DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION EFFECTUATE THIS ANTI DISCRIMINATION MANDATE BY ISSUING REGULATIONS AND GUIDANCE AND CREATING THE NATION WIDE ENFORCEMENT PROGRAM ADMINISTERED BY THE OFFICE FOR CIVIL RIGHTS. TITLE NINE APPLIES TO ALL AREAS OF AN EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS PROGRAMS AND ACTIVITIES AND THAT INCLUDES RECRUITMENT. ADMISSIONS HOUSING FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE ATHLETICS ACCESS TO COURSES AND CLASSES AND REPORTS OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT VIOLENCE. IT PROHIBITS DISCRIMINATION ON THE BASIS OF SEX MARITAL STATUS PREGNANCY AND CONDITIONS OF PREGNANCY AGAINST OUR STUDENTS AND OUR STAFF AND THESE EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS. FIRST AS YOU KNOW EQUAL ACCESS TO EDUCATION AND EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES ARE TOO OFTEN DENIED BECAUSE A STUDENT HAS BEEN SUBJECTED TO SEXUAL HARASSMENT OR VIOLENCE ON THE BASIS OF SEX. UNFORTUNATELY WE ARE IN A TIME OF INSTABILITY WITH RESPECT TO TITLE NINE REQUIREMENTS FOR PREVENTION AND REDRESS OF ACTS OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT INSULT. FOR THE PAST TWENTY PLUS YEARS TITLE NINE WAS INTERPRETED IN THE FOLLOWING WAYS. IT REQUIRED SCHOOLS COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT COMPLAINT PROCEDURES PROVIDING FOR A PROMPT AND GLOBAL RESPONSE TO ANY REPORTS ORAL WRITTEN OBSERVED OR EXPERIENCED OF DISCRIMINATION HARASSMENT. OR VIOLENCE ON THE BASIS OF SEX. IT PROHIBITED UNWELCOME CONDUCT OF A SEXUAL NATURE THAT IS SUFFICIENTLY SERIOUS SO SEVERE PROGRESSIVE OR PERSISTENT THAT CREATES A HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT ON OUR CAMPUS OR IT LIMITS EDUCATIONAL ACCESS. INCLUDING WHERE THE HARASSMENT OR SALT MAY HAVE FIRST OCCURRED OFF CAMPUS. IT REQUIRES SCHOOLS THAT KNEW OR REASONABLY SHOULD HAVE KNOWN ABOUT SEXUAL HARASSMENT VIOLENCE IMPACTING OUR STUDENTS TO ACT REASONABLY PROMPTLY AND EFFECTIVELY IN TAKING STEPS TO IN THAT HARASSMENT. PREVENTED FOR CURRENTS AND REDRESS ITS EFFECTS ON THE VICTIMS AN AS NEEDED OUR SCHOOL COMMUNITY. AND IMPORTANTLY WITH SOME EXCEPTIONS FOR CONFIDENTIAL COUNSELORS AND STAFF ANY SCHOOL EMPLOYEES WHO RECEIVE NOTICE OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT OR VIOLENCE AND WHO WAS STUDENT COULD REASONABLY BELIEVE. HAD THE AUTHORITY TO TAKE SOME ACTION WAS REQUIRED TO IMMEDIATELY REPORT SO THAT THE SCHOOL'S RESPONSE COULD BE BOTH PROMPT. AND EFFECTIVE. HOWEVER ON NOVEMBER SIXTEENTH TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THE US DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION UNDER THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ISSUED ITS PROPOSED SIGNIFICANT AND SWEEPING AMENDMENTS TO THE IMPLEMENTING REGULATIONS FOR TITLE. NINE IN A NOTICE OF PROPOSED RULEMAKING. IN RESPONSE ON JANUARY THIRTIETH TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE SUBMITTED A MULTI STATE COMMENT LETTER URGING THE COMPLETE WITHDRAWAL OF THE PROPOSED REGULATIONS BECAUSE THEY SO SEVERELY UNDERMINE THE ANTI DISCRIMINATION PROTECTIONS OF TITLE. NINE AND CALIFORNIA'S ABILITY TO ENSURE THAT IT SCHOOLS ARE FREE FROM HARASSMENT. OUR COMMENT LETTER SEVENTY ONE PAGES SO HIGHLIGHTED HERE TODAY ARE ONLY SOME OF THE RULES PROPOSED CHANGES. FIRST THE PROPOSED RULES DRAMATICALLY NARROW TITLE NINES DEFINITION OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT BY ONLY PROTECTING AGAINST CONDUCT BUT A VICTIM CAN SHOW TO BE SEVERE. PERVASIVE AND ALSO OBJECTIVELY OFFENSIVE. NOW UNDER THE PROPOSED RULE SCHOOLS WOULD ONLY NEED TO TAKE ACTION IF THE TITLE NINE QUARTER OR AN INDIVIDUAL WITH THE AUTHORITY TO ACTUALLY PUNISH THE PERPETRATOR. RECEIVES ACTUAL KNOWLEDGE. SO IF AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL STUDENT REPORTS OF SEXUAL ONLY A SECURITY GUARD OR A COACH OR IF THE SEXUAL ASSAULT IS PERPETRATED BY A PRINCIPAL FOR EXAMPLE AT A SCHOOL ITSELF. BUT NOT REPORTED TO THE SUPERINTENDENT OR TITLE NINE COORDINATOR THE SCHOOL WOULD NO LONGER BE REQUIRED TO ACT UNDER TITLE. NINE THE PROPOSED RULES HOLD EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS RESPONSIBLE ONLY IF THE RESPONSE IS FOUND TO BE DELIBERATELY DIFFERENT TO KNOWN AXE. THIS MEANS INTENTIONAL AND CLEARLY AND REASONABLE IN LIGHT OF KNOWN CIRCUMSTANCES. IT'S AN EXTREMELY HARD STANDARD TO MEET AND IT'S HIGH AND EXACTING. FURTHER IF A SEXUALLY HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT ON THE BASIS OF SEX IS FOUND THE PROPOSED RULES NO WORK NO LONGER REQUIRED EDUCATION INSTITUTION TO TAKE% IMMEDIATE ACTION TO EFFECTIVELY ELIMINATE THAT HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT PRINTS. PREVENT ITS RECURRENCE AND ADDRESS IT'S A FAX. THEY ALSO HAVE YOU HEARD ALLOWED FOR IN PERSON CROSS EXAMINATION OF SURVIVORS BY AN ADVISER WHO SELECTED BY THE OTHER PARTY. OR THE ACCUSED. WITHOUT IDENTIFYING LIMITATIONS TO PREVENT RETIREMENT IS ATION OR FURTHER HARASSMENT. THE RULES GENERALLY ALSO REQUIRE A FORMAL WRITTEN SIGNED COMPLAINT WITH A SPECIFIC REQUEST FOR AN INVESTIGATION TO BE FILED WITH THE TITLE NINE COORDINATOR TO RECEIVE A FULL INVESTIGATION. AND THIS IS SO EVEN IN OUR K. THROUGH TWELVE SCHOOLS REPORTS ARE OFTEN ORAL. AND BY YOUNG STUDENTS MANY OF WHOM WILL NOT KNOW THAT THEY NEED TO MEET THIS WRITTEN REQUIREMENT TO OBTAIN RELIEF. THE PROPOSED RULES ALSO PROHIBIT TITLE NINE'S PROTECTIONS FROM APPLYING IF THE HARASSING CONDUCT DID NOT OCCUR TO THE STUDENT WITH IN THE EDUCATION PROGRAM OR ACTIVITY. THIS CHANGES OUT OF TOUCH WITH HOW SEXUAL ASSAULT IMPACTS STUDENT ON CAMPUS. AS US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE ITSELF EXPLAINED IN FEDERAL COURT BRIEFING WHEN ASSESSING WHETHER OFF CAMPUS SEXUAL% ASSAULT CREATES A HOSTILE% ENVIRONMENT ON CAMPUS. COURTS HAVE RECOGNIZED THE PERNICIOUS EFFECTS ARE NOT LIMITED TO THE EVENT ITSELF AND CAN PERMEATE THE EDUCATIONAL ENVIRONMENT. FINALLY THE PROPOSED RULES REQUIRE THE SCHOOL OVERALL TODAY MISS DISMISS ANY COMPLAINT THAT DOES NOT MEET THESE NEW HEIGHTENED REQUIREMENTS. CALIFORNIA LAW INCORPORATES TITLE NINE STATUTORY AND REGULATORY CREDIT REQUIREMENTS SO IF THE REPROACH TO PROPOSE RULES BECOME FINAL THESE CHANGES TO THE REGULATIONS MADE BY THE US DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WOULD BECOME PART OF CALIFORNIA LAW. HOWEVER CALIFORNIA LAW ALSO STATES THAT CONSISTENT INTERPRETATION WITH TITLE NINE IS NOT INTENDED BY THE LEGISLATURE WHERE CALIFORNIA LAW PROVIDES FOR MORE PROTECTIONS OR IMPOSES ADDITIONAL OBLIGATIONS. AND AS YOU JUST HEARD CALIFORNIA LAW DOES PROVIDE MORE PROTECTIONS AND IMPOSE ADDITIONALOBLIGATIONS THAN TITLE NINE IN SOME OF THE FOLLOWING WAYS NOT ALL LISTED HERE FOR TIME REASONS. FIRST IT REQUIRES COMPREHENSIVE SEXUAL VIOLENCE PREVENTION TRAINING FOR STUDENTS. SECOND TO PROVIDE A BROADER AND MORE PROTECTIVE DEFINITION OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT THEN THE CURRENT AND PROPOSED US DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION DEFINITIONS. THIRD AND POST ACT SECONDARY EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS THAT RECEIVE STATE FUNDS FOR THE OFFENSES OF SEXUAL ASSAULT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE DATING VIOLENCE AND STALKING. CALIFORNIALAW HAS ESTABLISHED A STRONG AFFIRMATIVE CONSENT STANDARD. AND REQUIRES APPLICATION OF THE PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVIDENCE STANDARD. IT ALSO ESTABLISH PROCEDURES FOR KEEPING VICTIMS INFORMED OF THE STATUS OF DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS. WRITTEN NOTIFICATION ABOUT ON AND OFF CAMPUS RESOURCES AND TRAUMA INFORMED TRAINING FOR OUR CAMPUS INVESTIGATORS. IN THIS AREA OF INTERPRETATION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF BOTH CALIFORNIAN FEDERAL LAW ARE IMPORTANT TO THE SUCCESS OF CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS AND STUDENTS. BECAUSE WHEN NOT PREVENTED OR PROPERLY ADDRESS SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND VIOLENCE CAN HAVE A DEBILITATING IMPACT ON A STUDENTS ACCESS TO EDUCATION. AND AS YOU HEARD THERE IS ALREADY A SERIOUS LACK OF REPORTING ON THESE ASSAULTS. DUE TO REASONS SUCH AS FEAR OF REPRISAL. FOR THE HARASSMENT AND LACK OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT HOW TO OBTAIN REDRESS. I'M GOING TO TURN TO THE DEFINITION OF SEX AND GENDER UNDER CALIFORNIA AND FEDERAL LAWS. TITLE NINE REQUIRE STUDENTS TO BE PROVIDED AN EDUCATIONAL ENVIRONMENT FREE FROM DISCRIMINATION BASED ON JUST ONE EXPLICITLY IDENTIFIED CáC PROTECTED CATEGORY AND THAT IS. SIX WHILE MANY COURTS HAVE CONCLUDED THE TITLE NINE'S PROTECTIONS AGAINST DISCRIMINATION ALSO PROTECTS STUDENTS BASED ON GENDER IDENTITY. OR BECAUSE OF THEIR SEXUAL ORIENTATION. THE SUPREME COURT HAS NOT TAKEN UP THESE ISSUES YET. ALSO THE US DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION HAS NOT RECOGNIZE THE TITLE NINE ENCOMPASSES DISCRIMINATION ON THE BASIS OF SEXUAL ORIENTATION EVEN THOUGH AGENCIES LIKE THE EEOC. HAVE REACHED THIS CONCLUSION FOR EMPLOYEES OUR SCHOOLS WHO ARE PROTECTED UNDER TITLE SEVEN OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT. FURTHER IN FEBRUARY TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION RESCINDED THE PROTECTIVE GUIDANCE FOR TRANSGENDER STUDENTS THERE WAS ISSUED IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN DURING THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION. THE RESCINDED GUIDANCE ADVISE THE TITLE NINE PROTECT STUDENTS WERE DISCRIMINATED AGAINST EXCLUDED DENIED BENEFITS ARE SEPARATED ON THE BASIS OF THEIR GENDER IDENTITY AND THEIR TRANSGENDER STATUS. IN COMPARISON CALIFORNIA LAWS GO MUCH FURTHER. THEY SPECIFICALLY AND EXPLICITLY PROTECT AGAINST DISCRIMINATION ON THE BASIS OF SEX GENDER GENDER IDENTITY GENDER EXPRESSION AND SEXUAL ORIENTATION. FURTHERMORE THAT CALIFORNIA LAW PROHIBITS GENDER EXPRESSION DISCRIMINATION IS ADDITIONALLY REPORT RIGHT NOW BECAUSE IN THE PROPOSED TITLE NINE REGULATIONS THE US DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION HAS INDICATED THAT IT IS STEPPING AWAY. FROM PROTECTIONS FOR STUDENTS WHO HAVE BEEN SUBJECTED TO DISCRIMINATION ON THE BASIS OF SEX STEREOTYPING. IN CONTRAVENTION OF SUPREME COURT PRECEDENTS AND THE TEXT OF TITLE NINE THE PROPOSED REGULATIONS WOULD NO LONGER PROHIBIT EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS FROM USING AND DISTRIBUTING MATERIALS THAT PROMOTE OR PERPETUATE SEX STEREOTYPES. SO FOR EXAMPLE MAILING OUT RECRUITMENT FLYERS IDENTIFYING ONLY MEN IN OUR STEM CAREERS AND ONLY WOMEN IN THEATER AND DANCE. COULD BE PERMISSIBLE. THE PROPOSED REGULATIONS ALSO DO NOT STATE THAT HARASSMENT ON THE BASIS OF SEX MAIN COMPASS HARASSMENT BECAUSE A STUDENT FAILS TO CONFORM TO THOSE SEX STEREOTYPES. SO FOR EXAMPLE A YOUNG BOY WHOSE DISCRIMINATED AGAINST BECAUSE HE WEARS HIS HAIR LONG OR LIKES TO WEAR NOW NAIL POLISH MAY NOT BE PROTECTED UNDER THE PROPOSED REGULATIONS. IT IS EVEN MORE IMPORTANT FOR CALIFORNIA TO ENFORCE ITS OWN LAWS AND PROVIDE SIMPLE AND EXPEDITIOUS WAYS FOR LESBIAN GAY BISEXUAL TRANSGENDER QUEER AND GENDER NON CONFORMING STUDENTS AND THEIR PARENTS AND GUARDIANS. TO OBTAIN RELIEF. THIS IS AN AREA OF IMPORTANCE FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL JUST RECENTLY ON FEBRUARY TWENTY EIGHTH TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN OUR OFFICE JOIN TWENTY OTHER ATTORNEYS GENERAL AN AMICUS BRIEF IN SUPPORT OF A TRANSGENDER STUDENT WHO IS SUING. THE ST JOHNS COUNTY FLORIDA SCHOOL BOARD UNDER TITLE NINE BECAUSE THAT BOARDS POLICY PROHIBITS TRANSGENDER CHILDREN FROM USING RESTROOMS THAT CORRELATE WITH THEIR GENDER IDENTITY. AND AMONG OTHER THINGS ATTORNEY GENERAL'S ARGUED IN THE AMICUS BRIEF THAT PROTECTING DRENCHED TREND OR TRANSGENDER RIGHTS CONFERS BROAD SOCIAL BENEFITS WELL CREATING NO PUBLIC SAFETY. THREAT AND IMPOSING NOTE MEANINGFUL FINANCIAL BURDEN. NEXT I WILL TURN TO GENDER AND SEX EQUITY IN ATHLETICS. AND IN A NUMBER OF WAYS CALIFORNIA'S LAW HAS BEEN MODELED AFTER THE US DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION GUIDANCE AND FEDERAL COURT FEDERAL COURT DECISIONS AND INTERPRET TITLE NINE PROTECTIONS IN THIS AREA. CALIFORNIA IN FEDERAL AUTHORITIES DO NOT HOLD THAT SEPARATE FACILITIES TEAMS AND CONDITIONS FOR PLAY ARE INHERENTLY UNEQUAL. RATHER CALIFORNIAN FEDERAL AUTHORITIES SAY GENERALLY AS YOU HEARD THAT SEPARATE IS PERMITTED IN SPORTS FOR FEMALES AND MALES SO LONG AS SUBSTANTIALLY EQUAL OPPORTUNITY WITH RESPECT TO BOTH THE CONDITIONS. AN OPPORTUNITY TO PLAY IS PROVIDED FOR MEMBERS OF BOTH SEXES. UNDER FEDERAL AND STATE LAW WITH RESPECT TO THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR FEMALES AND MALES TO PLAY A SPORT. A SCHOOL'S ATHLETICS PROGRAM MUST EFFECTIVELY ACCOMMODATE THE INTERESTS AND ABILITIES OF MEMBERS OF BOTH SEXES BY MEETING ONE OF A THREE PART TEST. AND THE FIRST PART. PROVIDE ATHLETIC OPPORTUNITIES TO MALE AND FEMALE STUDENTS THERE ARE SUBSTANTIALLY PROPORTIONATE TO THEIR OVERALL ENROLLMENT AND THE SECOND. THE SCHOOL COULD SHOW A HISTORY AND CONTINUING PRACTICE OF EXPANDING OPPORTUNITIES RESPONSIVE TO THE INTERESTS OF THE UNDERREPRESENTED SEX OR IN THE THIRD A SCHOOL COULD SHOW THAT AVAILABLE OPPORTUNITIES AT THE INSTITUTION FULLY AND EFFECTIVELY MEET THE INTERESTS AND ABILITIES. OF THE UNDERREPRESENTED SEX. AND AS A NUMBER OF STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THIS SEPARATE BUT EQUAL LEGAL FRAMEWORK HAS RESULTED IN IMPROVEMENTS FOR WOMEN IN TERMS OF ACCESS TO SPORTS. MORE EQUITABLE FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT SCHOLARSHIPS HOWEVER AS I'M SURE OTHERS SPEAKERS TODAY WILL SHARE ENSURING EQUITY IN ATHLETICS REQUIRES CONSTANT VIGILANCE AND VIGOROUS OVERSIGHT AND ENFORCEMENT. BECAUSE CONDITIONS WITH RESPECT TO FILL FACILITIES STUDENTS INTERESTS AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR PLAY AMONG OTHER THINGS CHANGE FROM YEAR TO YEAR. IN ANY SCHOOL COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY. FURTHER WITH RESPECT TO IDENTIFY TO FIND WHETHER ANY QUALITY STILL EXISTS THE FEDERAL EQUITY IN EDUCATION ATHLETICS DISCLOSURE ACT REQUIRES ANNUAL REPORTING BY A POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS. ON PARTICIPATION STAFFING REVENUE AND EXPENSES BY OUR MEN'S AND WOMEN'S TEAMS. AND FOR K. THROUGH TWELVE BASED ON LEGISLATION RECENTLY PASSED CALIFORNIA LAW REQUIRES SITE LEVEL REPORTING OF PRECIPITATION OPPORTUNITIES AS WELL. AND THESE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS CAN PROVIDE US WITH INITIAL INFORMATION REGARDING WHETHER SEPARATE IS EQUITABLE. HOWEVER NEITHER SET OF REPORTS IS SUBJECT TO ON SITE OR OTHER AUDITING. FEDERAL LAW PROVIDES FOR IN CALIFORNIA LAW REINFORCES THE REQUIREMENT FOR TITLE NINE OR GENDER EQUITY COORDINATOR TO BE DESIGNATED FOR EACH DISTRICT COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY IN THE STATE. AND AS YOU HEARD THIS PERSON IS CHARGED WITH ASSESSING AND COORDINATING COMPLIANCE AND INVESTIGATING COMPLAINTS UNDER TITLE. NINE HOWEVER BECAUSE IN MANY OF OUR SCHOOLS THE DUTIES OF A COORDINATOR ARE VAST AND MYRIAD. AND INCLUDE RESPONSIBILITIES OTHER THAN TITLE NINE AND GENDER EQUITY WE MAY NOT ALWAYS HAVE SOMEONE AT THE SCHOOL LEVEL WITH EXPERTISE AND SUFFICIENT TIME TO ASSESS WHETHER FOR EXAMPLE. THE INTERESTS AND ABILITIES TEST HAS BEEN MAX ORDERING CONDUCT THE IMPORTANT ASSESSMENT OF THE ATHLETIC PROGRAMS COMPONENTS TO SEE WHETHER IN FACT EQUITY HAS BEEN ACHIEVED. WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE FEDERAL LAW THAT THE STATE HAS MERIT RETAIN SOME PRESUMPTIONS OF AN EQUALITY FOR WOMEN. FOR EXAMPLE IF THERE WAS ONLY A BOYS BASKETBALL TEAM AT A SCHOOL IN A YOUNG GIRL WANTED TO PLAY VEN IF SHE HAS THE SKILLS SHE WOULD NOT HAVE A RIGHT UNDER CALIFORNIA FEDERAL LAW BECAUSE THERE'S AN EXCEPTION EQUAL ACCESS. FOR SPORTS IDENTIFIED AS CONTACT SPORTS. FINALLY I WANT TO KNOW THAT TITLE NINE SPECIFIC COVERAGE IS LIMITED TO DISCRIMINATION IN THE UNITED STATES. FOR STUDENTS AND FACULTY WHO PARTICIPATE AND TEACH AND A STUDY ABROAD PROGRAM THE FEDERAL PROTECTIONS AGAINST DISCRIMINATION AND HARASSMENT ON THE BASIS OF SEX DO NOT APPLY. CALIFORNIA LAW DOES NOT SPECIFY AND IT'S TAX WHETHER THERE IS A SIMILAR JURISDICTIONAL LIMIT. ON BEHALF OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TAKING UP THIS VERY IMPORTANT TOPIC. GOOD THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THANK YOU SO WITH MEMBER. OF KAMALO THEIR DOLLS FOR A TIME IN THE MEETING WHEN BOTH MEDINA AND HIGH WORK. BE AT THE TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE BUT WE'RE WE'RE DONE WITH THE TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE. AND THE REVENUE AND TAX COMMITTEES SO THE FULL DISCLOSURE I BE WITH YOU. GOOD FOR FOR THE REST OF THE DAY HERE. AND ALSO ON THE I RECOGNIZE -- TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF BLOOM FOR JOINING US THIS AFTERNOON -- ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE DAY AS SEEN KNOWN -- THE STAFF REMIND ME THAT I HAVE I DO HAVE FUN SCHOOL CAN IT COULD I ASK YOU. TO COME BACK AND AND AND I'LL TRY TO BE QUICK. YEAH DID THE QUESTION IS GIVEN THAT THE CALIFORNIA LAW DO NOT ALWAYS AS STAND ALONE. AND INSTEAD OF REFERENCING TO A TITLE NIGHT. SHOULD WE AMEND THOSE LAWS TO QUALIFIED -- PROTECTIONS SAID THAT THE FEDERAL DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION NO LONGER PROVIDES. ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE WELCOMES AND UNDERGOING DIALOGUE WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IN THIS AREA -- IN LIGHT OF THE PROS REGULATIONS -- AS I DISCUSSED BEFORE -- THE CALIFORNIA LAW SAYS THAT WHERE YOU SPECIFICALLY PROVIDE ADDITIONAL PROTECTIONS OR YOU POSE ADDITIONAL OBLIGATIONS THOSE CAN BE READ TO BE ABOVE AND BEYOND. FEDERAL REGULATIONS AND TITLE NINE ITSELF SO IN THOSE AREAS ONE AREA FOR FURTHER CLARIFICATION MAYBE -- TO MORE EXPLICITLY INCORPORATE THOSE AREAS THAT YOU THINK ARE IMPORTANT TO PROTECT -- IN AREAS THAT YOU THINK -- SHOULD BE SHORED UP. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU NO WE MOVE TO THE NEXT ONE IS. THE KIND THOSE -- WAS HIGHER EDUCATION LEADERS. WHO CAN SPEAK TO THEIR -- CHALLENGES. IN THE AND OPPOSED BY ENFORCING TITLE. NINE AND WE HAVE -- SU SAYING TAYLOR. LOOK LOOK LINDA WHO. AND PETER KHôNG. GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY. I'M SORRY. I'M SUZANNE TAYLOR I. IN THE SYSTEM MIGHT HAD ONLINE CORNY OR FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SYSTEM. AND THERE HAVE BEEN AS YOU'VE HEARD A LOT OF DEVELOPMENTS IN THE TITLE NINE WORLD SOUND IMPORTANCE AND CHANGES IN A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY AND SO I'M GLAD THAT WE ALL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO UPDATE YOU. ON HERE TODAY. YOU SEE AS A NUMBER OF SERIOUS CONCERNS WITH THE PROPOSED TITLE NINE RULES MANY OF WHICH DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL FAIR I'M HIGHLIGHTED IN HER PRESENTATION. AND AS LARA STATED THE RULES WOULD NARROW THE DEFINITION OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND ALSO LIMóN APPLICATION OF SCHOOLS TITLE NINE GRIEVANCE PROCEDURES TO COMPLAINTS THAT MEET CERTAIN ADDITIONAL THRESHOLD REQUIREMENTS. AND I JUST PUT A NOTE THAT WE HAVE OTHER OBLIGATIONS OF BOTH ETHICAL AND LEGAL TO RESPOND TO MUCH OF THE BEHAVIOR THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION PROPOSES EXCLUDING FROM TITLE. AND SO ESSENTIALLY WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IS IF THE RULES ARE ON ISSUED IN THEIR CURRENT FORM. IS DEVELOPING PARALLEL PROCESSES ONE FOR ADDRESSING SEXUAL% HARASSMENT THAT WOULD FALL UNDER TITLE LINE AND ONE FOR DRESSING CONDUCT THAT WOULD NOT -- AND THAT OBVIOUSLY HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BE BOTH BURDENSOME TO OUR SYSTEMS AND CONFUSING TO OUR COMMUNITIES WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT WE TRY VERY HARD TO AVOID. AND IT'S ALSO BEEN NOTED THAT THE RULES WOULD REQUIRE LIVE HEARINGS AT WHICH PARTY'S REPRESENTATIVES CONDUCT CROSS EXAMINATION. AND I JUST WANT TO NOTE THAT THIS REQUIREMENT WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY DISADVANTAGED PARTIES WHO DON'T HAVE REPRESENTATIVES OR WHOSE REPRESENTATIVES ARE NOT ADEQUATELY PREPARED TO CONDUCT THE SORT OF ADVERSARIAL CROSS EXAMINATION ARE QUESTIONING THE DEPARTMENT APPARENTLY ENVISIONS. SO THIS REQUIREMENT WOULD CREATED IT AND INEQUITY IN THE PROCESS AND THEN PUT THE ONUS ON SCHOOLS TO CORRECT THAT AND EQUITY. AND I'M NOT GONNA GO INTO FURTHER DETAILS ABOUT OUR CONCERNS WITH THE TITLE NINE RULES DUE TO TIME BUT I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT YOU SEE HAS TAKEN A VERY STRONG STANCE AGAINST PARTS OF THE PROPOSED RULES AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT. AND AT THIS POINT WE OBVIOUSLY DON'T KNOW WHEN THE RULES WILL BE ISSUED OR WHAT THEY WILL ULTIMATELY REQUIRE -- AND SO WE'RE IN A LITTLE BIT OF A HOLDING PATTERN ON THAT FRONT. IN THE MEANTIME THIS PAST JANUARY A CALIFORNIA COURT OF APPEAL DECIDED A CASE WITH IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS FOR UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. SPECIFICALLY THE COURT RULED THAT WHEN A SEXUAL MISCONDUCT MATTER MAY RESULT IN SERIOU SANCTIONS FOR A STUDENT RESPONDENT AND CREDIBILITY ESSENTIAL TO THE TO THE CASE XIN. COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES MUST HOLD A HUGE LIFE HEARING AT WHICH THE RESPONDENT IS ALLOWED TO QUESTION THE COMPLAINT AND KEY WITNESSES AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HAD NOT PREVIOUSLY BEEN ARTICULATED BY THE COURTS. AND THIS IS SERIOUS IMPLICATIONS FOR YOU SEE BECAUSE FOR REASONS LIKE EXPLAIN IF YOU WISH WE HAVE BEEN USING AN INVESTIGATIVE MODEL RATHER THAN HEARING MODEL TO RESOLVE OUR COMPLAINTS. AND UNDER THAT MODEL THE INVESTIGATOR INTERVIEWS THE RESPONDENT AND THE COMPLAINANT SEPARATELY AND THE PARTIES MAKE QUESTION EACH OTHER AS WELL AS WITNESSES BUT THE QUESTIONS ARE ASKED BY THE INVESTIGATOR DURING INVESTIGATIVE PHASE. AND WHILE PARTY'S COULD APPEAL THE OUTCOME OF THE PROCESS WHICH MIGHT RESULT IN THE HEARING THERE WAS NO APPEAL OR HEARING AS A MATTER OF RIGHT. SO WHILE WE'RE WAITING TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS WITH THE TITLE LINE RULES WE HAD TO TAKE IMMEDIATE STEPS TO COMPLY WITH THIS COURT RULING. AND WE AT UC APPROACH THIS WITH THE PRIMARY GOALS OF PROTECTING BOTH THE PARTIES AND THE INTEGRITY OF THE PROCESS. SPECIFICALLY WHAT WE HAVE DONE IS REVISE OUR STUDENTS YOU TO CATIA AND PROCESS HER FRAMEWORK TO PROVIDE BOTH PARTIES COMPLAINTS AND RESPONDENTS. THE RIGHT TO AN EVIDENTIARY HEARING IN ANY CASE RESULTING IN SUSPENSION OR DISMISSAL. NOW WE KNOW THE PROSPECT OF A LIVE HEARING IS INTIMIDATING TO PARTIES AND PARTICULARLY FOR SOMEONE WHO'S WRESTLING WITH THE ALREADY DIFFICULT DECISION ABOUT WHETHER TO COME FORWARD AT ALL. AND SO WE'RE Q. AND WE'RE COMMITTED TO PROTECTING THEIR WELL BEING IN THE PROCESS. SOME OF THE THINGS WE'VE DONE TO MITIGATE POTENTIAL HARM TO PARTIES -- FROM THIS CROSS EXAMINATION IS -- HAVE THE QUESTIONING CONDUCTED BY THE APPEAL BODY SO NOT BY THE PARTIES ARE THE REPRESENTATIVES. ALLOW THE PARTIES TO HAVE SUPPORT PERSONS ALLOW THE PARTIES TO BE VISUALLY OR PHYSICALLY SEPARATED DURING CROSS EXAMINATION AND THESE ARE THINGS THE COURT IS SIGNIFIED ARE ACCEPTABLE. NOW WHILE THIS INTERIM PROCESS AND IS IN PLACE WERE ALSO DEVELOPING A LONGER TERM APPROACH TO CONNECTING HEARINGS AND OUR GOAL IS ISSUE THIS NEW PROCEDURE OVER THE SUMMER. NOW IF AND WHEN THE TITLE NINE RULES ARE ISSUED WE WILL AGAIN NEED TO REVISE AND REASSURE POLICY MEETING WE WILL HAVE MULTIPLE VERSIONS OF THE POLICY IN PLACE IN A RELATIVELY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. WHICH IS CERTAINLY NOT IDEAL AND SO THERE'S A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY RIGHT NOW ON COMPOUNDING THAT THAT YOU SEE WE RECENTLY UNDERTOOK AN EXTENSIVE PROCESS TO REVISE OUR SEXUAL VIOLENCE AND SEXUAL HARASSMENT POLICY. AND THAT WAS TO COMPLY WITH AN IS SIERRA RESOLUTION AGREEMENT IMPLEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR AND MORE SIGNIFICANTLY TO RESPOND TO EXTENSIVE INPUT THAT WE RECEIVED -- FROM OUR COMMUNITY ON THE POLICY. WE SUBMITTED THE REVISED POLICY OCR FOR ITS APPROVAL IN FEBRUARY WHICH WAS REQUIRED BY THE RESOLUTION AGREEMENT. AND WE HAD ANTICIPATED THEY WOULD APPROVE IT THIS SPRING SO THAT WE CAN ISSUE IT IN THE SUMMER. HOWEVER GIVEN THE TIMELINE RULES ARE PENDING AND ARE REVISED POLICY DOES NOT COMPLY WITH THOSE RULES WE DON'T EXPECT IS HERE TO APPROVE THAT POLICY -- AT THIS STAGE SO THAT CREATES ANOTHER LAYER OF UNCERTAINTY AND SOME OF THESE CHALLENGES I'M TALKING ABOUT ARE SPECIFIC TO YOU SEE BUT MANY OF THEM ARE SHARED BY OTHER UNIVERSITIES AND SYSTEMS IN THE STATE. IS A HOPE THIS SHORT PRESENTATION AND HAS HELPED HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE AND OTHERS ARE FACING DURING THIS ON CERTAIN TIME. AS WE WORK HARD TO FULFILL WHAT IS -- A STRONG AND UNFALTERING COMMITMENT TO PROVIDING A PROCESS THAT'S NOT ONLY FAIR AND RESULTING JUSTIN RELIABLE OUTCOMES BUT THE TREATS PARTIES WITH RESPECT AND COMPASSION THANK YOU KILLER IT WAS WE WERE CONCERNED ABOUT THE ABILITY OF THE FACT THAT THEY PROPOSE RULES WOULD BE REDEFINING SEXUAL HARASSMENT. UNDER TITLE NINE IN A NARROW SCOPE -- BUT WOULD NOT NARROW THE SCOPE OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT PROHIBITED BY OTHER LAWS IN WHICH CASE THE PARALLEL PROCESS THAT SUZANNE SPOKE WITH ABOUT EARLIER WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD CERTAINLY WELCOME -- THE PROPOSED RULES ALSO A SEEK TO ENSURE A FAIR GRIEVANCE PROCESS IN SCHOOL JUST SIMPLER AND DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS BY REQUIRING DUE PROCESS PROTECTIONS FOR RESPONDENTS. HOWEVER THESE -- DUE PROCESS PROTECTIONS THAT ARTICULATED IN THE PROPOSED RULES IN SOME CASES EXCEED EVEN CRIMINAL. SAYS PROTECTIONS THAT ARE IN PLACE -- AND THEREFORE WE FEEL IS -- AND PRY IMPRACTICAL AND UNNECESSARY IN TERMS OF AN EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION -- WE ALSO -- COMMENTED TO THE EFFECT THAT THE CROSS EXAMINATION REQUIREMENT THAT WOULD ALLOW AN ADVISER -- CHOSEN BY THE STUDENT I TO CROSS EXAMINE THE OTHER PARTY -- WOULD GO AGAINST THE TRAUMA INFORMED PRACTICES OF THAT WE'VE. WE HAVE ATTEMPTED TO IMPLEMENT THROUGHOUT OUR CAMPUSES -- IN THIS CASE IT WOULD POTENTIALLY ALLOW FOR AN ATTORNEY WHO WAS HIRED BY ONE PARTY -- TO CROSS EXAMINE ANOTHER STUDENTS AND KEEP IN MIND THE STUDENTS ARE AVERAGING ANYWHERE FROM EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR YEARS OLD -- AND WOULD REALLY CREATE THE SORT OF BECAUSE I JUDICIAL A SITUATION -- THE PROPOSED RULE ALSO EXCLUDES PRIOR STATEMENTS BY PARTIES THAT WERE NOT PRESENT AT THE HEARING SO IN -- IT THEIR INVESTIGATION PROCESS IF IT WERE DETERMINED THAT THERE WAS A PARTY A WITNESS TO THE EVENTS WHO HAD SIGNIFICANT INFORMATION AND THAT WITNESS WAS NOT AVAILABLE FOR THE HEARING THE PROPOSED RULES WOULD. AUTOMATICALLY EXCLUDE THE ABILITY FOR THE HEARING OFFICER TO CONSIDER THE TESTIMONY OF THAT INDIVIDUAL. SO THAT IS ALSO AND AN ERROR AND WITHOUT ANY HEARSAY EXCEPTIONS -- THAT ARE NORMALLY A PARENT IN IN CIVIL AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE PROCEEDINGS -- SO EVEN EVEN THE MOST FORMAL JUDICIAL PROCESSES ALLOW FOR THIS IN SOME INSTANCES AND SO OUR COMMENT SPECIFICALLY ARTICULATED THE DESIRE FOR THIS NOT TO BE INCLUDED. IN THE ULTIMATE RESOLUTION REGULATIONS -- WITH REGARDS TO THE RECENT COURT OF APPEALS DECISION -- WE HAVE ALSO TAKEN EXTRAORDINARY STEPS TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE. ONCE THE DECISION WAS ISSUED AND ON JANUARY FOURTH -- WE ACTED FAIRLY SWIFTLY ESPECIALLY FOR A SYSTEM AS LARGE AS OURS AND ISSUED IMMEDIATE GUIDANCE TO OUR CAMPUSES TO HALT ALL PROCESSES ON SEXUAL MISCONDUCT. PENDING MATTERS -- AT THAT POINT -- WE BEGAN IMMEDIATELY WORKING ON AN INTERIM POLICY SO THAT WE CAN BECOME COMPLIANT WITH THE HEARING REQUIREMENTS -- THAT WERE -- MANDATED AND REQUIRED BY THIS NEW DECISION -- AS A RESULT -- WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON ALSO TRAINING HEARING OFFICERS -- TO BEGIN HEARINGS AND WE'RE HOPING THAT THESE WILL BEGIN IN MID TO LATE APRIL -- THE INTERIM POLICY IS ESSENTIALLY BEEN FINALIZED AND SHOULD BE IN PLACE WERE ANY MINUTE NOW HONEY TAKE NOW POSSIBLY -- SOME OF THE KEY COMPONENTS THAT WE'VE TRIED TO KEEP IN PLACE TO ENSURE THAT OUR STUDENTS ARE STILL -- BEING TREATED FAIRLY AND APPROPRIATELY -- IS THAT STUDENTS WILL BE ALLOWED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE HEARING VIA VIDEO CONFERENCING. AND THAT STUDENTS -- WILL NOT ENGAGE IN DIRECT CROSS EXAMINATION WILL GIVE THEM ON THE ABILITY FOR THE HEARING OFFICER SO STUDENTS CAN SUBMIT THEIR QUESTIONS TO THE HEARING OFFICER. WHO WILL THEN -- ADDRESS THOSE QUESTIONS TO THE PARTIES AS NECESSARY -- WITH REGARD TO ATHLETIC FACILITIES WE DO HAVE A CAMPUS WIDE OUR SYSTEM WIDE POLICY THAT REQUIRES THAT DEPUTY TILE NINE COORDINATORS BE IDENTIFIED. WHO CAN INSURE THAT THERE IS FAIRNESS WITHIN OUR ATHLETIC PROGRAMS -- I WON'T I SEE THAT MY TIME IS COMING TO A CLOSE SO I'LL I WILL I WILL SPARE YOU THE THAT THE LINK THE ADMONITION WITHIN OUR EXECUTIVE ORDERS THAT MANDATES. THE AREAS IN WHICH OUR DEPUTY TIELINE COORDINATORS -- ARE REQUIRED TO ENSURE FAIRNESS AND OUR ATHLETIC PROGRAMS BUT IT IS A NOT FOR OUR POLICIES AND AND COMPLIED WITH REGULARLY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- MISS WHOSE HOME WILL GO TO A COMMUNITY COLLEGE. PETER CONN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MY NAME IS PETER CAM A DEPUTY COUNSEL WITH THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES -- IN MY ROLE I DO PRODUCT PROVIDED ADVICE ADVICE GUIDANCE ON TITLE NINE CLEARY ACT -- TRANSGENDER STUDENTS RIGHTS AND ALSO TITLE FIVE THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNE COLLEGE THEY PROMULGATE REGULATIONS AND WE DO HAVE A TITLE. FIVE PROCESS THAT -- PREVENTS -- PROHIBITS DISCRIMINATION ON PROTECTED CLASSES AND CHARACTERISTICS SEX AND GENDER -- THEY ARE INCLUDED AND SO. WE HAVE SEVENTY THREE LOCALLY ELECTED BOARDS AND WIN THE TITLE NINE PROPOSED REGULATIONS OR WERE RELEASED WE DID OUR CHANCELLOR DID -- SUBMIT COMMENTS VERY SIMILAR CONCERNS THE UC AND CSU -- I THINK OUR BIGGEST CONCERN WAS THE SIGNIFICANT CHILLING EFFECT ON THE VICTIM'S ABILITY AND THE WILLINGNESS TO COME FORWARD TO REPORT SEXUAL HARASSMENT SEXUAL ASSAULT -- SPECIFICALLY THE PROCEDURAL BEARS THAT THE PROPOSED REGULATIONS -- DISCUSSED THE STANDARD OF EVIDENCE AND ALSO THE CROSS EXAMINATION THAT HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED -- FURTHERMORE THE DEFINITIONS OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND ACTUAL KNOWLEDGE WE BELIEVE ARE TOO NARROW -- IT ENABLES INSTITUTIONS TO TURN A BLIND EYE A DISABLED WE DIDN'T HAVE ACTUAL KNOWLEDGE. AND THE DELIBERATE INDIFFERENCE STANDARD THAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SPOKE ABOUT EARLIER IS TOO HIGH OF A STANDARD -- WE DO HAVE STUDENTS TO STUDY ABROAD AS WELL SO TITLE AND THE PROPOSED HAD AND I REGULATIONS -- WOULD NOT ALLOW STUDENTS TO STUDY ABROAD AND HAVE ANOTHER STUDENT -- HYPOTHETICALLY -- AND SEXUALLY HARASSED SECTION SAW AND WHEN THOSE STUDENTS COME BACK THERE WOULD BE NO PROTECTION FOR THAT STUDENTS SO WE WE DID DISCUSS THAT AS WELL. AND YOU KNOW OUR OUR COMMENTS WERE TEN PAGES IN THERE ALSO IN INCLUDED IN YOUR MATERIALS TODAY. IN RESPONSE TO THE TITLE NINE NUMBER TEN NINE REGULATIONS WE HAVE SENT ADVISORIES TO OUR COLLEGES AND WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF UPDATING OUR TITLE FIVE REGULATIONS -- SPECIFICALLY WE WANT. TO I'M GOING TO DISCUSS AND WE WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THERE IS A EDUCATION CODE SECTION THAT -- ANY TYPE OF SEXUAL ASSAULT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE STALKING THE PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVIDENCE STANDARD WOULD BE APPLIED. AND IN LIGHT OF THE U. S. C. CASE. ANY TYPE OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT -- WHERE AS A STUDENT IS -- SEVERELY DISCIPLINED THE YOU KNOW THE THE IN DIRECT. AND INDIRECT HEARING WE WE ARE GOING TO BE DISCUSSING THAT AS WELL -- WE'RE DOING SOMETHING SIMILAR TO A CSU IS DOING WHERE WE'RE NOT GOING TO ALLOW FOR A DIRECT -- EXAMINATION SO THE THE CALVARY COMMUNICABLE AGES WE WERE THE LARGEST POST SECONDARY INSTITUTION IN THE UNITED STATES WE SERVE TWO POINT ONE MILLION STUDENTS. THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND SO WE FEEL AS IF YOU WE DO HAVE A NEED TO PROTECT OUR STUDENTS WE ALSO HAVE CLASSIFIED STAFF MEMBERS YET THOUSANDS OF CLASS BY STAFF MEMBERS. AND FACULTY MEMBERS THAT SERVE OUR STUDENTS SO -- WE UNDERSTAND THAT. NOT ONLY ARE WE SERVING OUR STUDENTS BUT ALSO ARE THE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE -- HELPING THE IN EDUCATE OUR STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CAN ON NOW WE MOVE TO THE ASSOCIATION OF INDEPENDENT COLIFORM. THANK YOU AND GOOD AFTERNOON -- CHAIRS AND MEMBERS OF THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO JOIN YOU TODAY -- MY NAME IS THOMAS OF WHO I AM WITH THE ASSOCIATION OF INDEPENDENT CALIFORNIA COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. A I SEE SEE YOU AS THE U. -- ORGANIZATIONAL VOICE FOR OVER EIGHTY INDEPENDENT NONPROFIT HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS IN THE STATE -- TOGETHER THE ICC MEBER INSTITUTIONS EDUCATE NEARLY WHILE ONE HUNDRED NINETY THOUSAND UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS AND OVER ONE HUNDRED SIXTY NINE THOUSAND GRADUATE STUDENTS. OUR MEMBER INSTITUTIONS ARE DIVERSE IN MANY REGARDS -- IN MISSION IS TO EMBODY AND AND RESOURCES WHAT IS COMMON AMONG THEM. IS THAT ALL OF OUR MEMBER UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES ARE COMMITTED TO PROVIDING SAFE ENVIRONMENTS FOR THEIR STUDENTS. IT'S COMMITMENT INCLUDES WORKING WITH STUDENTS FACULTY AND STAFF TO DEVELOP POLICIES PRACTICES AND SOLUTIONS. THEY DO SO IN THE FRAMEWORK OF STATE AND FEDERAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS AND LEGAL INTERPRETATIONS BY COURTS. MORE IMPORTANTLY -- AND MOST IMPORTANTLY HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS INSTITUTIONS JUST WANT TO DO THE RIGHT THING. OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS -- INDEPENDENT INSTITUTIONS HAVE ADAPTED TO FEDERAL GUIDANCE AND STATE LAWS AROUND TITLE NINE AND CAMPUS SEXUAL ASSAULT. INSTITUTIONS OF ESTABLISH THE POLICIES IN PROCESS SEASON TRAIN THEIR STUDENTS FACULTY AND STAFF. OUR PRESIDENT SHARE THE SAME CONCERNS -- AS OUR PARTNERS IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR -- ABOUT THE US DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION'S NOTICE OF PROPOSED RULEMAKING OR NPR M. -- THAT WOULD AMEND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF TITLE. NINE AND THE EFFECTS WOULD HAVE ON STUDENTS AND INSTITUTIONAL EFFORTS TO COMBAT. A CAMPUS SEXUAL ASSAULT AND MISCONDUCT. IN JANUARY -- AICC YOU JOINED A LETTER BY THE AMERICAN COUNCIL ON EDUCATION. ADDRESS TO THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION ABOUT THE NPR M. WHICH I'VE. THEIR SERGEANTS HAVE ABOUT PASSED OUT -- AND THE COMMENTS EXPRESSED OUR STRONG CONCERNS ABOUT PROVISIONS IN THE PROPOSED REGULATIONS THAT WE BELIEVE WOULD UNDERMINE INSTITUTIONS ABILITIES -- TO ENSURE EQUITABLE AND FAIR RESOLUTIONS AND TO PROTECT VICTIMS OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND MISCONDUCT. I JUST WANT TO ADDRESS QUICKLY DRESSED OF A COUPLE OF A VERY PROBLEMATIC POINTS ABOUT -- THAT WE SHARE ABOUT THE A PROPOSED REGULATIONS. THAT THEY WOULD REQUIRE A LOT HEARINGS AS AS BEEN MENTIONED AND CROSS EXAMINATIONS AND ALLOWS THE AFFECTED STUDENTS TO HIRE ADVISERS TO ASSIST AND THE QUESTIONING. IF THE RESPONDENT OR ACCUSER CANNOT AFFORD AN ADVISER THE CAMPUS MUST HIRE ONE FOR THE STUDENT. OUR CAMPUSES RESOURCES ARE VERY DIVERSE. AND FOR SOME SMALLER INSTITUTIONS COULD BE THIS COULD BE A VERY COSTLY -- TO IMPLEMENT. THIS PROCESS EFFECTIVELY TURNS OUR CAMPUSES INTO BECAUSE I COURTROOMS WE BELIEVE THIS WILL HAVE A CHILLING EFFECTS ON THE REPORTING OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT AND THE WILLINGNESS OF VICTIMS WITNESSES AND RESPOND AS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROCESS. THIS PROCESS TO INVESTIGATE ALLEGATIONS OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT IS NOT IN THE BEST INTEREST OF STUDENTS. THE PUBLICATION THAT UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES AIMS TO PROTECT INSTEAD INSTITUTIONS SHOULD BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN THE ABILITY TO CHOOSE HOW THEY INVESTIGATE CLAIMS INCLUDING ALLOWING QUESTIONING THROUGH A PANEL OR SUBMISSION OF QUESTIONS. THE PROPOSED RULES ALSO REQUIRE A SINGLE FEDERALLY MANDATED EVIDENTIARY STANDARD OF PROOF. ACROSS ALL DISCIPLINARY PROCESS THESE. NPR AND ALLOWS INSTITUTIONS TO SELECT OTHER PREPONDERANCE OF EVIDENCE OR CLEAR AND CONVINCING EVIDENCE THAT STANDARD OF PROOF. BUT THEY MUST ALSO APPLIED THE SELECTION ACROSS THE BOARD THIS MEANS THAT THE SAME CENTER OF PROOF MUST BE ADOPTED FOR ALL PROCEEDINGS WHETHER IT'S SEXUAL MISCONDUCT -- EMPLOYEE DISCIPLINE PLAGIARISM VIOLATIONS AT CETERA. WE BELIEVE THIS ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH IS WRONG WE BELIEVE THE IS THAT INSTITUTIONS SHOULD HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO CHOOSE DEPENDING ON THE VIOLATION. AND THAT THE DEPARTMENT SHOULD NOT MICROMANAGE CAMPUS DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS. IN REGARDS TO THE CALIFORNIA COURT OF APPEALS RECENT DECISION -- LIKE THE PROPOSED REGULATIONS BY THE US DEPARTMENT OF ED. THE COURT DECISION UP AND OUR INSTITUTIONS ESTABLISHED PROCESS THESE -- THE DECISION SIMILAR TO WHAT THE NPR IN PROPOSES TO DO TAKES AWAY UNIVERSITIES ABILITY TO CHOOSE HOW THEY INVESTIGATE INVESTIGATE CLAIMS. AND HOW THEY CONDUCT QUESTIONING. OUR MEMBER INSTITUTIONS ARE ASSESSING THE COURT DECISION TO UNDERSTAND -- THE IMPACT ON STUDENTS AND THEIR INVESTIGATORY PROCESS SEES AND HOW THEY WOULD NEED TO CHANGE THEIR PRACTICES TO BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE DECISION. HOW FINISHED BY SAYING THAT AND MISS THE CHANGING LANDSCAPE ON THE FEDERAL AND STATE LEVELS ARE MEMBER CAMPUSES REMAIN COMMITTED TO UPHOLDING CIVIL RIGHTS? AND TO CREATING CAMPUS ENVIRONMENTS THAT ARE SAFE AND SUPPORTIVE AND RESPONSIVE TO ALL STUDENTS. AND AS BOTH LEVELS OF GOVERNMENTS ARE DECIDING HOW TO MOVE FORWARD ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE OUR UNIVERSITIES ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE POTENTIAL CONFLICT BETWEEN FEDERAL LAWS AND STATE LAWS. AND THERE IS STUDENTS BEING CAUGHT IN BETWEEN. I THANK YOU AND I'M AVAILABLE TO TAKE YOUR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FROM. SURE MEDINA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION -- AS CHAIR OF HIGHER ED -- YOU YOU'RE SHOULD PRIVACY PRETTY AWARE OF THE HEARINGS THAT WE'VE HAD OVER THE YEARS AT THE DIFFERENT -- ESPECIALLY UC CAMPUSES WERE. OF MY PREDECESSOR DAS WILLIAMS -- CONVENE UP AND DOWN THE STATE AT UC SANTA BARBARA AND UCLA -- WHERE WE HEARD? OF FROM STUDENT -- VICTIMS. RIGHT -- AND SO AT THE SEXUAL HARASSMENT IS SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN VERY IMPORTANT A TWO TO OUR COMMITTEE -- BUT AT THE SAME TIME -- I THINK -- I I WAS AWARE AND AND I AND I WOULD THINK THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE DIFFERENT -- INSTITUTIONS WERE PROBABLY AWARE THAT THE COURTS -- MIGHT NOT HAVE -- YOU KNOW EVEN AS WE WERE HAVING THOSE HEARINGS WE WERE HEARING THAT THE COURTS MIGHT NOT UPHOLD. A STRICT NOUS OF OUR RULES AS AS THEY PERTAIN TO THE PERPETRATORS AND TO THE PROCESSES. AND AND THE CONSEQUENCES. AND SO HOW SURPRISE ARE WE FROM THE COURT OF APPEALS DECISION. I AND I AND CHANGING. THE WAY -- WE HAVE. TO CONDUCT BUSINESS IF YOU WILL. ARE WE SURPRISE -- I DON'T I'M NOT QUITE SURE HOW TO ANSWER THAT AND I DON'T KNOW IF. I WOULD SAY THAT THEY WERE SUPPOSED [inaudible] SURPRISED -- BUT IT DOES CREATE -- IS THE SOME CONSTERNATION AND YOU KNOW GOING BACK TO AS HAS BEEN MENTIONED NO LOOKING AT THEIR PROCESS SEES AND KNOWS SPECIALLY GIVEN. HOW DIVERSE OUR INSTITUTIONS ARE SOME HAVE MORE RESOURCE RESOURCES AND OTHERS -- IT CREATES A CHALLENGE -- FOR MANY OF OUR INSTITUTIONS AND AND GIVEN THE FACT THAT THE NOW WITH THE COURT OF APPEALS CHANGING THE WAY. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS TO DO THE PROCESS OF OF CARRYING OUT THE NOT SO MUCH THE INVESTIGATION BUT THE ACTUAL -- WAY IT COMES TO A CONCLUSION RIGHT WERE GIVEN THE GIVEN THE ALLEGED PERPETRATOR THE OPPORTUNITY. TO ADDRESS -- THE THE VICTIM CORRECT THAT THAT'S A CHANGE IS THAT RIGHT. RIGHT SO FOR MANY YEARS THE SINGLE INVESTIGATOR MODEL HAD BEEN A MODEL THAT WAS I'M CONSIDERED APPROPRIATE IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND WHAT THAT MODEL MEN'S WAS THAT. THERE WOULD BE ONE INVESTIGATOR WHO WOULD CONDUCT THE INVESTIGATION -- MAKE FINDINGS AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE GOING TO POLICY VIOLATION AND MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT SANCTIONS -- WHAT THE COURTS HAVE NOW REQUIRED IS THAT THERE IS A HEARING PROCESS THAT IS ALLOWS FOR A SEPARATE HEARING OFFICER? TO REVIEW THE INVESTIGATORY -- REPORT OF THE INVESTIGATOR AND THEN MAKE THE FINDINGS -- FROM THEIR SEPARATE SPHERE -- THEIR SEPARATE PERSPECTIVE -- IS SO SORRY JUST TO SPEAK TO YOUR EARLIER QUESTION. EITHER WAS -- SOME INDICATION THAT THE COURTS WERE MOVING IN THIS DIRECTION IT WAS NOT A COMPLETE AND TOTAL SURPRISE. HOWEVER HAVING SAID THAT I THINK IT'S BEEN MADE CLEAR MANY TIMES BEFORE AND EVEN THE COURT OF APPEALS HAVE SAT IN PRIOR RULINGS. THAT THESE OUR CLASSROOMS AND NOT COURT ROOMS SO THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE COURT HAS SEEN TO IT -- TRANSPOSON TO AN EDGE WHAT HAS NORMALLY BEEN AN EDUCATIONAL PROCESS I THINK IT'S CAUGHT SOME OF US BY SURPRISE. HEY AND JUST SO FOR MY OWN CLARIFICATION. AMONG THE CHANGES THAT THE COURT SAID IS THAT THE ALLEGE PEPPERED PERPETRATOR HAS THE OPPORTUNITY. TO TO QUESTION IS THAT THAT'S A NEW. ABILITY TO QUESTION IS SOMETHING THAT WAS ALREADY WELL ESTABLISHED AND IS ONE TO EXPLAIN THAT SOMETHING THAT WAS PROVIDED THROUGH. ON EITHER HEARING OR THE SINGLE INVESTIGATOR MODEL THAT MANY INSTITUTIONS USE IT'S THE REQUIREMENT THAT THERE BE A LIVE HEARING. ON IN CERTAIN SEXUAL MISCONDUCT CASES THAT IS NEW [inaudible] ALIVE. OKAY AND AND THIS COURT HEARING WHAT WOULD WHAT EFFECT DO YOU THINK OF IT WILL HAVE ON THE REPORTING. OF SEXUAL ASSAULTS. IN IN THE DIFFERENT SYSTEMS. WE START RIGHT OKAY. WHERE WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE CHILLING EFFECT IT MAY HAVE ON REPORTING -- THAT THE THE THE IDEA OF HAVING THE IDEA BEHIND THE SINGLE INVESTIGATOR MODEL WAS THAT A LITTLE WHILE IT WOULD ALLOW FOR QUESTIONING TO OCCUR BETWEEN THE PARTIES WOULD BE DONE THROUGH THE INTERMEDIARY INVESTIGATOR. THIS NEW MODEL ALTHOUGH WE ARE ALLOWING PARTIES TO BE IN SEPARATE LOCATIONS WHERE HAVING THE QUESTIONS COME THROUGH THE HEARING OFFICER. IN OUR EFFORT TO SORT OF MEET TO MAINTAIN AS MUCH -- INTEGRITY OF THE NORTH -- PRIOR PROCESS THAT WE CAN -- WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE IMPACT TO COMPLAINTS OF HAVING. TO SIT IN A ROOM POTENTIALLY EVEN IF IT'S VIRTUALLY -- WITH THE PERSON THEY'RE ACCUSING OF HAVING SEXUALLY ASSAULTED THEM. HAVE WE SEEN THE NUMBER GO DOWN ALREADY OR NOT YET WE WE ARE EARLY TO TELL I THINK IT'S TOO EARLY TO TELL YEAH I THINK IT'S REALLY TELLING AND ONE THING I WOULD ADD ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEDINA AT THE THE US YOU CASE -- ANYTIME IS A STUDENT IS ACCUSED OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT AND THE DISCIPLINARY ACTION ON THE STUDENT IS VERY SEVERE. AND THE WITNESS IN A WIN THIS IS THE CREDIBILITY IS AT ISSUE THAT'S WHEN -- THE LIVE HEARING -- THAT THAT'S WHEN THE COURT RULED THAT THERE SHOULD BE A LIVE HEARING AND AND ONE THING I WOULD ALSO POINT OUT IS THAT THE COURT OF APPEALS ARE DOWN NELLIE WE HAVEN'T HEARD FROM A COURT OF APPEAL IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. IN THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT HAS HAS ALSO NOT RULED -- ON THIS ISSUE. AND MAYBE YOU LAST QUESTION. IF I MAY THE GOVERNOR RECENTLY IN NOVEMBER -- ISSUED A REPORT ON SEXUAL MISCONDUCT ISSUES ANY THOUGHTS ON HIS REPORT IF YOU HAD A CHANCE TO LOOK AT THE GOVERNOR'S. REPORT ON SEXUAL MISCONDUCT OF NOVEMBER. WELL AT AS I SAID AND YOU SEE IS WELL WE HAVE THIS AND TERM PROCESS IN PLACE DEVELOPING A LONGER TERM MODEL AND WE FOUND THAT REPORT TO BE VERY INSTRUCTIVE AND HELPFUL. IN WORKING THROUGH THAT THANK YOU. RIGHT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND THINK YOU'LL A PANELIST WHO ARE MOVING ON TO THE LAST BUT DEFINITELY NOT THE LEAST. WE HAVE A PANEL OF CATERED TO K.. TO TWELVE EDUCATION LEADERS. WHO SHARE WITH US -- DEAR RUTH -- EFFORT TO ADDRESS THIS CHALLENGES. BUT OPPOSED BY ENFORCING THE TITLE. NINE AND WITH US TODAY THE WE HAVE. HE NAMED JACKSON. AN INJECTION OF THE DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT OF CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. ROGER BLAKE. EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF CALIFORNIA -- INTEREST COLOR. FEDERATION AND ASHLEY. MISSOURI MORE TOLL THE VICE PRESIDENT OF STRANGERS CALL THE STATE. ATHLETIC CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION FOR HEALTH PHYSICAL EDUCATION RECREATION AND DANCE. YEAH AND ALSO [inaudible] KIM TURNER. SENIOR STAFF ATTORNEY. FAIR PLAY FOR GIRLS IN SPORTS PROJECT. ALL RIGHT AT THE TABLE THANK YOU. I LIKE IT OKAY. WE'LL START WITH THE THIS PROJECTION [inaudible] YOUR ALL. RIGHT. AFTERNOON SIR COMMITTEE MY NAME IS KIND JACKSON DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT GOVERNMENT FAIRS AND CHARTER SCHOOLS FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION ON BEHALF OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION. TONY THURMOND SO THANK YOU FOR HAVING US HERE. TODAY. SURE YOU CAN. I DO THIS I'LL TRY TO MAKE SURE I WORK THE POWER POINT CORRECTLY. SO YOU DON'T CALIFORNIA HAS A PROUD HISTORY OF GOING ABOVE AND BEYOND THE FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS IN MANY AREAS AND GENDER EQUALITY IS ONE OF THEM. TITLE NINE IS APPLICABLES TO PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SCHOOLS DISTRICTS COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION AND CHARTER SCHOOLS THAT RECEIVE FEDERAL FUNDS. EACH SCHOOL DISTRICT THAT RECEIVES FEDERAL FUNDS IS REQUIRED TO HAVE A TITLE NINE COORDINATOR THAT IS VISIBLE AND IT IS AN INTEGRAL PART OF ENSURING NONDISCRIMINATION AT SCHOOLS. ONE WAY CALIFORNIA GOES ABOVE AND BEYOND IS THAT IT PROHIBITS DISCRIMINATION BASED ON GENDER. GENDER EXPRESSION GENDER IDENTITY AND SEXUAL ORIENTATION AS YOU AS YOU'VE HEARD TODAY. ANOTHER IS THROUGH SENATE BILL ONE THREE SEVEN FIVE OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN SENATE BILL THIRTEEN SEVENTY FIVE STRENGTHENED AND EXPANDED. COM. THE TITLE NINE AND STATE SEX EQUITY IN EDUCATIONAL REQUIREMENTS IT REQUIRES A PUBLIC SCHOOLS PRIVATE SCHOOLS SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION. AND CHARTER SCHOOLS PULLS INFORMATION ON THEIR INTERNET WEBSITE RELATIVE TO THE DESIGNATED TITLE NINE COORDINATOR. THE RIGHTS OF STUDENTS IN THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF SCHOOLS AND A DESCRIPTION OF HOW TO FILE A COMPLAINT. WITH RESPECT TO ENSURING EQUITY. THERE ARE THREE TYPES OF MONITORING IMPLYING OF COMPLIANCE ACTIVITIES THAT OCCUR ONE EDUCATIONAL EQUITY REVIEWS AND EXAMPLES OF REVIEWS ARE ENSURING THAT DISTRICTS HAVE A PROCESS TO IDENTIFY AND RESOLVE. DISPROPORTIONAL NUMBER OF STUDENTS OF ONE SEX IN A PARTICULAR COURSE FOR EXAMPLE ENSURING THAT IT LET IT PROGRAM SUPPORTED BY PUBLIC FUNDS PROVIDE EQUAL OPPORTUNITY. FOR PARTICIPATION BY ALL STUDENTS AND ENSURING EQUITABLE USE OF SUCH FUNDS. ALL STUDENT CLUBS HAVE ACCESS TO FACILITIES AND A FAIR OPPORTUNITY TO MEET. COURSES IN ACTIVITIES DO NOT RESULT IN THE SEPARATION OF STUDENTS BASED ON PROTECTED FACTORS SUCH AS GENDER ETHNICITY. AND COUNSELING MATERIALS ARE FREE FROM DISCRIMINATION BASED ON SEX. TO CIVIL RIGHTS IN FEDERAL REVIEWS THESE REVIEWS HAVE FOCUSED ON ALL FEDERAL CIVIL RIGHTS LAWS WHICH INCLUDES TITLE NINE AND ALSO GENDER EQUITY IN THE RECRUITMENT. AND IT ADMISSIONS TO CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS. AND ALSO ITEMS SUCH AS ENSURING THAT LOCKER ROOMS CHANGING ROOMS ROOMS SHOWERS RESTROOMS NEW THE C. T. E. AREAS ARE COMPATIBLE FOR BOTH MEN AND WOMEN WITH THE SAME AMENITIES AND APPROXIMATE SPACE. AND LASTLY UNIFORM COMPLAINT PROCEDURES THE UC P. AS YOU KNOW IS A CALIFORNIA'S COMPLAINT PROCESS FOR ISSUES RELATED TO THE DISCRIMINATION HARASSMENT INTIMIDATION OR BULLYING. IT IS WHERE STUDENTS PARENTS AND OTHERS MAY FILE COMPLAINTS RELATED TO TITLE NINE AND OTHER ISSUES. OKAY SO NOW THAT I BRIEFLY JUST DISCUSS FOR YOU SOME OF OUR MORE FORMAL PROCESSES REGARDING MONITORING AND EDUCATIONAL EQUITY I REALLY AM EXCITED TO HIGHLIGHT OUR RESOURCES PERTAINING TO GENDER EQUITY. IN THIS CASE A SPECIFIC AROUND STEM EDUCATION THAT ARE DRESSING IN EQUITY FOR GIRLS AND SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY ENGINEERING AND MATH. SO AS WE KNOW WOMEN IN THE WORKFORCE AND IN THIS NATION ARE ARE REALLY UNDER UTILIZE UNTAPPED GREATEST FORCE THAT WE HAVE. THE UNDER REPRESENTATION OF WOMEN IN STEM RELATED JOBS PLACES THEM AT AN ECONOMIC DISADVANTAGE WOMEN IN STEM JOBS EARN ON AVERAGE 33% MORE THAN THEIR COUNTERPARTS IN NON STAM RELATED JOBS. FROM AN EARLY AGE -- FROM AS EARLY IN AGES FOUR YEARS OLD PERCEPTIONS ABOUT THE APPROPRIATE GENDER OF SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS IS INFLUENCE AND REINFORCED BY THE MEDIA. PREDOMINATE IMAGES OF MEN AND IN STEM RELATED FIELDS IN THE MEDIA CALLS BOTH GIRLS AND YOUNG WOMEN BOYS AND YOUNG MEN TO SEE THESE FEELS AS MORE MALE DOMINATED. AND MORE MASCULINE IN NATURE. SO ARE THE CALIFORNIA FRAMEWORK. ALL TEACHERS AND EDUCATION SUPPORT PROFESSIONALS CAN ENSURE THAT CREATING A LEARNING ENVIRONMENT THAT PROMOTES OPEN DIALOGUE RISK TAKING AND A CULTURE THAT VALUES LEARNING WERE ALL STUDENTS FEEL SAFE. AND EXCITED ABOUT ENGAGING WITH SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING ALL TEACHERS CAN SUPPORT GIRLS AND YOUNG WOMEN TO THRIVE AND STAND CLASSROOMS. NO ONE THING THAT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW IS -- YEAH MYSELF AND THE SUPERINTENDENT IS SELF OR RAISING YOUNG GIRLS AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO US THAT WE FOSTER POSITIVE DIALOGUE AROUND THIS CONVERSATION. AND SO ON YOU CAN SEE THAT ARE FRAMEWORK GUIDES TEACHERS TO PLACE GIRLS IN LEADERSHIP POSITIONS DURING GROUP WORK CAN BE A POSITIVE IMAGES REGARDING THE COMPETENCY OF GIRLS. HIGHLIGHT WOMEN ROLLS AND MENTORS IN STEM FIELDS ASSESS THEMSELVES IN. ENSURING FEMALE STUDENTS HAVE EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES TO PARTICIPATE. H. BRINGS US TO EXPANDING LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES FOR GIRLS IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION STEM OFFICE PARTNERED WITH THE CALIFORNIA COMMISSION ON THE STATUS OF WOMEN AND GIRLS TO ACTIVELY ENGAGE STUDENTS. TO INCREASE PARTICIPATION FOR WOMEN IN STEM FIELDS THIS RESULTED IN THREE SEPARATE -- ENGAGING GIRLS IN STEM TOWN HALL EVENTS THESE EVENTS HAVE BEEN CONTINUING IN AN ONGOING BASIS AT THE COUNTY LEVEL AROUND THE STATE. AND FOR EXAMPLE IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE MERCED COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION HAS BEGUN A PROGRAM THAT SINCE FEMALE STUDENTS AND THEIR MOTHERS GRANDMOTHERS AND OTHER FEMALE GUARDIANS TO SCIENCE CAMP TOGETHER. WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT GIRLS ARE MORE LIKELY TO ENGAGE IN STEM FIELDS IF THEY DO SO WITH ROLE MODELS THAT THEY HAVE A SIGNIFICANT PERSONAL CONNECTION WITH? AND THIS WAS THE IDEA BEHIND STUDENTS ENGAGING WITH STAMINA OTHER FEMALE MEMBERS OF THEIR FAMILY. WITH OTHER MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY. AND THIS IS JUST A PICTURE JUST SHOWING SOME OF THE PARTICIPANTS OF ONE OF THE THREE COUNTY ENGAGING GIRLS AND STAND TOWN HALLS. AND SO WITH THIS POSITIVE NOTE -- ANY QUESTIONS THAT'S ALL I HAVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- NEXT WILL WORK -- BUT ROGER HELP ME OUT HERE YEAH. AND WE JUST GOT TO FIND IT IS. TELL ME THAT'S IT I THINK THAT'S HEY VALUE. THANK YOU I'M GLAD TO BE HERE I'M ROGER BLAKE OF THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA'S PLASTIC FEDERATION WITH THE GOVERNING BODY HIGH SCHOOL SPORTS FOR CALIFORNIA. I AM HAPPY TO TELL YOU I AFTER FORTY THREE YEARS IN PUBLIC EDUCATION PUBLIC SERVICE I'M RETIRED AT THE END OF THIS YEAR SO I HAVE BROUGHT MY STAFF ALONG BECAUSE SOMEONE ELSE HAS TO CARRY THIS ON AND THIS IS A IMPORTANT TOPIC. SO I HAVE A STAFF HERE ALONG WITH THE AND DIANNE MARSHALL FREEMAN OR GENERAL COUNSEL SHE WAS. CAUGHT UNFORTUNATELY HE'S OUR GENERAL COUNSEL SHE'S DEALING WITH AN ISSUE FOR US RIGHT NOW SO SHE WASN'T ABLE TO JOIN US. THIS IS THE WORD I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT TALK ABOUT TODAY'S THE ATHLETIC AREAS. IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE FUN. SO THIS IS HOW WE ALL LOOK ON MONDAY. AND THAT'S ALWAYS A BY FRIDAY. AND I AND I RUN INTO MANY OF YOUR THE LEGISLATORS WHEN YOU'RE GOING HOME TO YOUR DISTRICTS ON THURSDAY AFTERNOON THE AIRPORT WHEN I'M GONE SOMEWHERE AND I THINK WE ALL CAN RELATE TO THAT SO -- CAN HAVE SOME FUN WITH THIS OKAY HERE WE GO CHAU. YOU CAN SEE WE HAVE A SIXTEEN HUNDRED AT JUST OVER SIXTEEN HUNDRED HIGH SCHOOLS IN CALIFORNIA. ONE POINT NINE MILLION -- HIGH SCHOOL AGE STUDENTS BUT ABOUT SIX POINT TWO MILLION K. TWELVE STUDENTS SO WHEN YOU'RE TALKING AND YOU HEARD ALL THE THINGS TODAY ABOUT TITLE NINE YOU GOT TO THINK A LITTLE BIGGER THAN. MY WORLD IS ONE POINT. NINE BUT HIS IS SIX POINT WO AND SO IT'S IT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT ISSUE THAT WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THIS IS THE NUMBERS THAT I WANT TO SHARE. I'VE BEEN WITH TWENTY ONE YEARS NOW WITH THE C. I. F. A. N. AS YOU CAN SEE PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE. IF YOU LOOK IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR NUMBER OF KIDS OR PARTICIPATE IN HIGH SCHOOL SPORTS. COMPARED TO TODAY AND ON END WHAT'S REALLY GOOD ABOUT THOSE NUMBERS OF TOTAL PARTICIPANTS. HIGH SCHOOL ENROLLMENT IS ACTUALLY GONE DOWN A LITTLE BIT. SO WHAT'S GOOD IS BORN MORE BOYS AND GIRLS ARE PARTICIPATING IN ATHLETICS THAT SOIT SHOWS YOU THAT OUR SCHOOLS ARE OFFERING MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR KIDS. YOUR FEEL THE DRAINS ALSO OF IF YOU BUILD IT DOT COM WELL. DONE -- LET'S BUILD IT KIDS ARE KIDS. BUT YOU CAN SEE THE NUMBER THOUGH WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBER OF MALE AND FEMALE STUDENTS LOOK AT THE GENDER GAP IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR TO TODAY IT'S CLOSED. BUT THAT STILL SIGNIFICANT GAP. IN ONE OF THE THINGS PEOPLE SEEM TO FORGET AND THAT'S WHY I WAS KIND OF HIGHLIGHTED HERE AT THE BOTTOM SHE DOES IT BECAUSE SHE SMILES. SHE'S RIGHT THERE SHE'S AT THE SCHOOL SITE THESE DAYS. KIDS PLAY BECAUSE IT'S FUN. MEET ALL THE PROBLEMS WE HAVE IT ON MY WORLD OF ATHLETICS IS ISN'T THE KIDS THE KIDS ARE OKAY. BUT IS THE ADULTS IN US OFFERING OPPORTUNITIES. SO THERE'S THE NUMBERS IN HERE IS ONE OF THE PROBLEMS THAT I THINK OUR SCHOOLS FACE TODAY IS THAT LITTLE RED ERROL AT THE BOTTOM. WHEN I'M SIXTY FIVE I'M A LITTLE OLD I'M RETIRED? WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL ALL OF MY COACHES WERE TEACHERS AT SCHOOL THAT'S NOT THE CASE ANYMORE 72% OF THE TEACHERS COACHES OF OUR HIGH SCHOOL KIDS IN CALIFORNIA ARE WALKEN'S? GREAT MEN AND WOMEN THEY COME TO SCHOOL. AFTER SCHOOL IS OUT SO THEY DON'T SEE THEIR KIDS AT ALL ACCEPTED PRACTICE ONE OF THE ISSUES I THINK. IN THIS IS PURELY ANECDOTAL FROM MY STANDPOINT WHAT THAT'S A BIG ISSUE BECAUSE THAT TEACHER ON CAMPUS THAT SEES A GOOD STUDENT A GOOD KIDS. IS THAT RECRUITING THEM TO COME PLAY SPORTS BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT INVOLVED OR NOT INVOLVED IN THE CHESS CLUB THE DRUMMER ANYTHING. BECAUSE THEY'RE GREAT. BUT THE VOLUNTEERING THEIR TIME AFTER SCHOOL SO THAT CREATES A PROBLEM ON OUR CAMPUSES FOR OUR SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS. SO HERE EQUITY IN SCHOOLS. SOME OF THOSE PICTURES I LOVE SOME OF THEM THAT ONE YOU PROBABLY RECOGNIZE IN THE BOTTOM A SWEET WATER. EIGHTY THIS YOU HEARD ALL THIS STUFF EARLIER TODAY IT AND IT'S THEIR IMPORTANT SUBJECTS BUT IT. IN DEALING WITH THE LAW IN EVERYTHING IS HAPPENING. BUT IT'S IT'S SO DIFFICULT I GUESS I WANT TO MAKE THIS AND IF YOU JUST INDULGE ME FOR TWO MINUTES. THIS IS HOW EASY TITLE NINE IS I NOW USE THIS EXPLANATION I'D GO OUT AND DO PRESENTATIONS ALWAYS WITH ACCESS THE ASSOCIATION OF SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENTS. WITH THEIR SCHOOL BOARDS SO IF YOU TWO WOULD JUST INDULGE ME FOR SAYING READY. THIS IS MY SON AND THIS IS MY DAUGHTER. THANK GOD YOU DIDN'T HAVE MY JEANS ARE YOU WITH A GUN. THIS IS MY SON AND THIS IS MY DAUGHTER. DO I TREATED THE SAME. NO. I TREATING DEFINITELY THEY HAVE DIFFERENT LOVES DIFFERENT NEEDS DIFFERENT THINGS THEY LOVE TO DO. HI BUT WE'RE GONNA SUPPORT IN WITH EVERYTHING WE GOT. NOW SCHOOL BOARD MEMBERS SUPERINTENDENTS UPDATE THINK ABOUT THIS IS YOUR CHECK YOUR KIDS HERE THEY ARE. NO COMES CHRISTMAS TIME. DO I TAKE MY SON TO NORDSTROM'S IN MY DAUGHTER TO TARGET. WELL WE'RE PUBLIC EDUCATORS SO WHERE HAVE WE'RE LUCKY WE COULD AFFORD MACY'S. BUT NO WE WOULDN'T DO THAT WOULD WE THAT'S WHAT TOTAL LINE SAYS I'M GONNA TREAT MY SON AND DAUGHTER THE SAME I'M NOT TAKING HIM TO NORDSTROM SENT HER. TO TARGET. LIKE TREATING THEM THE SAME WE'RE GONNA GO TO MACY'S AND WE'RE GONNA GET THE SAME QUALITY MATERIALS AND AN ATHLETIC EQUIPMENT. SO I WANT TO GET INTO THEIR WORLD IN THAT IN THERE LIKE YOU START SEEING THEIR HEADS NOT AND THEN THE NEXT IF YOU GO. NOW EVERY YEAR CHRISTMAS UNCLE RON RIGHT THERE IN THE MIDDLE BLOOM THE CIGAR COMES TO CHRISTMAS IN EVERY YEAR AT CHRISTMAS. HE COMES TO MY SON. HERE'S YOUR BMX BIKE. COOL HERE IS MORE -- DON'T KNOW LET'S LET'S JUST GIVE HER THIS OKAY AND THEN WHAT DO YOU DO WHAT HAPPENS NEXT YEAR WHEN UNCLE RUN COMES TO CHRISTMAS AND YOU GET A BRAND NEW BASEBALL BAT TO COST THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS. AND MY DAUGHTER SHE GETS SOMETHING THAT'S JUST. LAUGHS WHAT DO I DO AS A DAD. I TELL. UNCLE RON YOU CAN'T COME TO CHRISTMAS ANYMORE. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DO THIS TO MY KIDS. IN THE WORLD OF HIGH SCHOOL SPORTS WHO IS ON CALL RUN BOOSTER CLUBS. NOW IT THE HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL OUR SCHOOLS NEED BOOSTER CLUB THEY NEED THEM TO DO THE FUND RAISING AND OR TO WE TRY TO EDUCATE OUR DECISION MAKERS IN K. TWELVE IS GOING. YOUR PARENT TILL UNCLE ONE YOU CAN'T DO THAT. THE WE HAVE TO WORK FOR WE HAVE TO MAKE IT FAIR FOR BOTH KIDS. AND THEY DON'T ALWAYS WOULD YOU EXPLAIN IT THAT WOULD A STAR TO GO ALL. TOTAL NINE NOT ALL THAT HARD IS IT WHEN YOU LOOK UP HERE IT CAN IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO COLLEGIATE LEVEL THE THE FINANCES SIDE. I MEAN THE MONEY ON THE LEFT IS UNCLE BOB IN THE BOOSTERS AND ALL THE FUND RAISING THE KIDS DO AND THEN ON THE RIGHT. WELL THAT'S OUR DISTRICTS BUDGETS BECAUSE IN HIGH SCHOOL SPORTS ACROSS THE STATE IT'S LESS THAN 2% OF THE GENERAL FUND THEY DON'T PUT VERY MUCH MONEY INTO IT THERE'S OTHER PRIORITIES IN EVERYBODY GETS IT. BUT THEY HAVE TO REMEMBER AS LEADERS. HERE IT DON'T TREAT OUR KIDS DIFFERENTLY [inaudible] GET [inaudible] SO. I AM EMBARRASSED BY THIS PICTURE. THIS IS A CAMPUS IN CALIFORNIA. LOOK AT THE BASEBALL FIELD IN THAT PRETTY. WELL TAKEN CARE OF THE MAN. MAN CURED OF ME BEAUTIFUL LOOK ON THE LEFT. THAT'S THE SOFTBALL FIELD. IN THE END THE RESPONSE FROM THE ADMINISTRATORS AT THE SCHOOL ONCE. WELL THE BOOSTER CLUB DID THAT THEY HIRED PEOPLE THEY DON'T ALL THESE THINGS IN. AND I GO BACK TO ALL HOME. I'M NOT GONNA TREAT MY SON'S ROOM HEY YOU GET THE BALCONY AND YOU GET THE BIG ROOM IN YOUR SLEEP IN THE BASEMENT CAUGHT WOULD YOU DO THAT. THEY GO NO. WELL THAT'S WHAT WE JUST DID HERE. THE BIGGEST ISSUE I CREE CALLS AND MY OFFICE IS THAT FACILITIES. IN WHICH GREAT THESE DAYS IS THE YOUNG WOMEN ARE COMMON PLAN SPORTS THEIR DADS GET MAD. BECAUSE THEY LOOK AT THAT GO THAT'S NOT RIGHT. IT IS CHANGING AND THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED WE'RE HERE. TALKING WITH KRISTA EARLIER WE WERE HERE TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT IN THIS WAS THE SAME ISSUE AND I MIGHT USE THAT SAME PICTURE -- THESE ARE YOUR BABIES BUT IT'S I THE ONLY REASON I LOOK AT A LOOK AT 200-012-1370 IT'S IT'S NOT CHANGING THIS IS NOT BRAIN SURGERY. SO WHAT WE GOTTA DO. WE NEED TO EDUCATE WE'VE HEARD ABOUT TITLE NINE COORDINATORS IN K. TWELVE IN THE HIGH SCHOOL AREA -- SKEWS ME IN K. TWELVE DISTRICTS THERE THE HUMAN RELATIONS PERSON THEY DON'T HAVE THE ISSUE HER THEY GOT A THOUSAND THINGS THEY DON'T HAVE TIME. THERE'S WE OFFER ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT CLASSES BUT YOU GOTTA DRAGON TO GET ON THERE BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW. WE DO ALL TYPES IN THESE THINGS ARE IN YOUR PACKET WE DO IN SERVICES FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS BECAUSE THE BIGGEST ISSUE IS. THEY DON'T KNOW THE QUESTIONS TO ASK ABOUT TITLE. NINE YOUR TITLE NINE AND THEY GET SCARED SEXUAL HARASSMENT LAWSUITS ALL THESE THINGS IN THERE LIKE. THEY DON'T KNOW THEY DON'T IF THEY KNEW THE QUESTIONS ASKING WOULD BE SIMPLE FOR THEM. WE NEED TO EDUCATE. THE DECISION MAKERS. AFTER CAN DETER ARTICLE CHILL TALK ABOUT IT THOUGH IS SB THIRTY GRAY BE THIRTEEN FORTY NINE BILL THE REPORTING WAS IT'S GREAT DEAL. THE NOBODY DID IT. 42% SOME SO WE STARTED GO OKAY WE GOT EDUCATED DECISION MAKERS I JUST DID IT WITH THE SCHOOL BOARDS ASSOCIATION WE DID WITH CCESS. BECAUSE WE'VE GOT TO EDUCATE THE DECISION MAKERS. YOU'RE GOING TO HATE THIS PART. THIS ISN'T BRAIN SURGERY THIS IS REALLY EASY AND THERE'S SO MUCH MATERIAL SO MANY DIFFERENT PUBLICATIONS AND THINGS THAT ARE OUT THERE AND AVAILABLE FOR SCHOOLS. THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION CHAU OFF HER OFFICE WE COULD PUT TOGETHER AND SIMPLE EASY THING FOR TITLE NINE OFF COORDINATORS TO START GETTING A UNDERSTANDING OF THIS -- I THINK WE SAID THIS IN. TWO THOUSAND EIGHT THIS IS ON OUR WEBSITE ALL THESE THINGS THAT HAPPEN TO THOSE LINKS GO STRAIGHT TO HER OFFICE. THERE'S SO MANY THINGS AND THEY'RE FREE. THEY'RE FREE UNFUNDED MANDATES EVERYBODY'S GONNA GO CRAZY IF YOU PUT FORWARD A BILL ANOTHER UNFUNDED MANDATE. IT ISN'T GONNA COST VERY MUCH CAUSE EVERYTHING'S FREE OUT THERE IT'S JUST A MATTER OF SOMEBODY PUTTING IT TO GATHER. IN SINCE I WON'T BE HERE BUT THEY WILL I CAN VOLUNTEER CIF WILL BE PART OF THIS IF YOU WANT. YEAH IT'S GREAT. SO HERE'S MY TAKEAWAYS. EIGHT THESE ARE THE TAKE AWAYS OR TITLING COORDINATORS THEY DON'T KNOW THE QUESTIONS TO ASK THEY DON'T KNOW THEY HAVEN'T GOTTEN TRAINING. AND I YOU KNOW WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO OUR COLLEAGUES AT THE COLLEGIATE LEVEL I DON'T THINK THEY HAVE THE TRAINING THERE EITHER. BECAUSE YOU DON'T SEE IT WHEN YOU'RE ON THE CAMPUS THE GOT A LOOK AROUND. ME NEW WALKING A CAMPUS YOU'D SEE THE BY SOFTBALL BASEBALL FIELD A ROCK. THEY NEED TO DO THEIR OWN SELF REVIEWS THERE IN MY BOOKS THERE IN. THINGS ON HER WITH IT'S REALLY EASY TO KIND OF FIGURE OUT WHERE MY NOT MAKING IT AND WHAT DO I NEED TO DO TO GET BETTER. AND THE LAST ONE YOU KNOW HOW DO WE CLOSE AT JUST THAT GAP TO USE ALL RIGHT THERE. YOU CAN ASK THE KIDS WHAT WHAT SPORTS IN THE BEGIN THAT'S PART THERE'S A THREE PRONGED SHE MAY HIT ON BUT PART OF IT IS ASK THE KIDS WHAT THEY'RE WHAT ARE THEY DON'T WANT TO PLAY WHAT ARE WE DOING. IT. IT IS AMAZING WHEN YOU BUILD IT THEY'LL COME DO IT SO IT'S REALLY DOES FOR MY TAKEAWAYS YEAH. INCOME ON REMEMBER IT'S FUN FOR KIDS IT'S FUN. AND IT'S OUR JOB AS THE ADULTS TO PROVIDE THOSE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THEM TO HAVE FUN. GET OFF MY SOAPBOX. AND I BELIEVE. OUR ANYTHING CASUALLY EXCEL BUT ASHLEY. SOME THE MOTO. GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME MY NAME'S AUSTIN MODE I'M GOING TO PROVIDE YOU WITH A STATUS UPDATE ON EQUITY IN HIGH SCHOOL ATHLETICS. I KNOW ROGER -- HAVE TO DO A LITTLE BIT ON NUMBERS -- IT'S ALL KIND OF SKIP THAT BECAUSE I ACTUALLY WENT OVER THAT AS WELL -- I MET THE PEOPLE FOR IN THIS CLASSIC ATHLETICS WITH CAPER -- I'M ALSO KERN ATHLETIC DIRECTOR OF AN ATHLETIC DIRECTOR FOR EIGHT YEARS AND I'M ALSO A PHYSICAL EDUCATOR AND THEN -- I HAD A SON KIND OF GIVE UP COACHING FOR THE MEANTIME BUT WE'LL SEE IF I GET BACK INTO THAT SO AGAIN THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME -- SO THIS IS A THE ONE PROGRESS AND I KNOW NUMBERS IS AND EVERYTHING AND BUT I DID WANT TO SHOW THAT. WE ARE CLOSING THE GAP AND I PUT NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO BECAUSE I WANT TO SHOW HOW FAR WE'VE COME IN THE PAST FORTY YEARS SO -- SEVEN POINT 4% OF FEMALE SO WHERE THE ONES WHO ARE PARTICIPATING AND CURRENTLY IT'S AROUND 43% -- THE SECOND ACCOMPLISHMENT IS THAT THE GAP IS CLOSING SO OVER TIME. WE HAVE IN NINETEEN OUR STORY IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WE ACTUALLY HAVE OVER A MILLION KIDS MORE PARTICIPATING NOW THAN WE DID -- PREVIOUS YEARS -- THE SECOND ONE AGAIN IS. PARTICIPATION NUMBERS BY THE STATE SO -- WE'RE RANKED ACTUAL CALIFORNIA'S ACTUALLY RANKED NUMBER TWO IN THE UNITED STATES AND PARTICIPANTS -- WHICH IS GREAT TO SEE SO WE HAVE A JUST A LITTLE BIT OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND KIDS THAT ARE PARTICIPATING BOTH MALE AND FEMALES -- THE SECOND THING THAT I WANT TO POINT OUT IS THAT WHEN WE COMPARE TEXAS WHO WAS NUMBER TWO NUMBER ONE AND THEY ACTUALLY HELP ONLY HAVE LIKE. FIVE I THINK IT'S FIVE THOUSAND MORE KIDS PARTICIPATING SO WE'RE WE'RE PRETTY CLOSE WITH THEM -- CALIFORNIA ACTUALLY HAS MORE FEMALES PARTICIPATING SO LOTS OF PEOPLE ARE AS WE DO -- YOU KNOW AND IT EQUATES TO ABOUT TWENTY THOUSAND MORE FEMALES ARE PARTICIPATING SO -- IT WAS GREAT TO SEE THAT WHEN I WAS LOOKING THROUGH THE DATA. AND THE NEXT THING. THAT I WANT TO GO OVER IS I PUT IN A CALL IN THE QUALITY AND ATHLETIC SO -- AGAIN I'M NOT A SINGLE SITE I SEE THE SMALLER SCHOOL DIVISIONS BECAUSE I'M AT A SMALLER SCHOOL WE PLAY LIKE THE FORTY FIVE D. SIX AND I ACTUALLY EMAILED OUT TO ALL OF THE CENTRAL SECTION BECAUSE I'M FROM FRESNO. AND I GIVE A SURVEY. AND I KIND OF WANTED TO SEE WHERE EVERYBODY WAS WHERE THEY SAW THAT THEY FELT THAT THEY WERE. ON BOARD WITH WHAT THEY FELT THEY AGREED WITH VERSES -- WHERE THEY DID IT SO AS YOU CAN SEE -- PETE'S TYPE IN AMOUNTS OF THE DOLLAR AMOUNT -- THEY AGREED TO WITH THE PRACTICE FACILITIES THEY AGREED WERE -- PRETTY EQUITABLE ALLOCATION OF TRAVEL AND TRANSPORTATION SO BOYS AND GIRLS THE TEAMS ARE PRETTY EVEN. FACILITIES GAME AND PRACTICE TIMES ACADEMIC TUTORING AND UNLOCK ROOM FACILITY FACILITIES SO THE MIXER RESPONSES -- WHICH IS A GREAT TO SEE BECAUSE IT'S ABOUT HALF OF THE ITEMS THAT I THAT I PUT OUT THERE WAS A PUBLICITY SO THIS ALL THAT -- ONE SIX IS BEING MORE PUBLICIZED IN THE OTHER FACILITIES AND OF FOR NOT WHAT ACTUALLY TRAINER MEDICAL SERVICES SO MY THOUGHTS ON THIS WERE MORE HAVING TO GO WITH FOOTBALL AND SO LIKE AT WITH THE FOOTBALL SPORT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO HAVE AN AMBULANCE THERE. A TRAINER THAT TYPE OF THING SO THAT'S MY THOUGHT I'M GOING IN THAT DIRECTION MAYBE THAT'S WHERE THE UNFAIRNESS WAS -- THE FOURTH ONE WAS EQUITY IN FUNDS PROVIDED BY THE DISTRICT TO PAY FOR EQUIPMENT. SO WITH IN MY DISTRICT WE ACTUALLY DON'T HAVE BOOSTERS SO THE SO OUR DISTRICT ACTUALLY PROVIDES A LOT OF MONEY -- FOR OUR FOR OUR ATHLETIC PROGRAMS AND SO -- MY THOUGHTS AGAIN WITH THIS ONE ARE. FOOTBALL HELMETS PADS. FOR A HUNDRED HUNDRED TWENTY KIDS IS PRETTY EXPENSIVE -- THE CLEMENT BUT THE UTILIZES EXPENSIVE SO I'M JUST THINKING IN IN THAT ASPECT THAT MAYBE. THAT'S WHERE THE INEQUITY OF FUNDS IS FROM AND THE COACHING POSITION SO -- YOU LOOK AT A FOOTBALL STAFF WHICH USUALLY HAS. I DON'T KNOW TEN MAYBE YOU KNOW DEPENDING ON HOW MANY LEVELS THEY HAVE AND YOU CAN'T REALLY COMPARE OF FOOTBALL STAFF TO OF ALL ABLE STAFF. FOR SOFTBALL STAFF SO GOING THROUGH THAT -- SO ATTENTION AREAS I'M GONNA GO BACK TO THE NUMBERS -- SO FOOTBALL'S NUMBER ONE SO IN THE NATION WE HAVE. MILLION KIDS OVER MILLION KIDS EVERY YEAR PLAYING FOOTBALL AND THERE'S REALLY. NO OTHER SPORT THAT CAN COMPARE LOOKING AT THE FEMALE ASPECTS OF TEXAS HAS A HUNDRED AND SIXTY FOUR THOUSANDS OF PARTICIPATING CALIFORNIA HAS NINETY FOUR AND THEN THE THIRD. ONE IS ACTUALLY BUT FORTY TWO THOUSAND SO -- WE ARE IN THEM UP THERE WITH THE MOUNTIE KIDS PARTICIPATING SO THEN WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO LOOK AT NUMBERS. YOU CAN'T YOU CAN'T COMPARE. THE MALES TO FEMALES -- BUT THEN IF LOOKING OVER AT THE MALES THEY ACTUALLY. THE TRACK AND FIELD AND FOOTBALL IS. THE MOST POPULAR SPORTS FOR MALES AND FEMALES -- BUT YOU CAN SEE THEY STILL HAVE AN OUTRAGEOUS AMOUNT A NUMBER MORE MALES PARTICIPATING THAN FEMALES AND THEN WHEN YOU LOOK DOWN AT TENNIS WE ACTUALLY HAVE TENNIS HAS MORE FEMALE SO THAT'S GREAT TO SEE THAT THE MALLS THERE IS A FEW MOST WORN OUT THERE THAT HAS MORE. PARTICIPANTS THAN MALES -- BUT YOU COULD SEE THERE'S JUST AN OUTRAGEOUS AMOUNT OF STUDENTS WHO ARE -- THE PARTICIPATING WHICH IS GREAT BECAUSE ASYOU CAN SEE OUR NUMBERS ARE HIGH BUT THERE'S STILL MORE -- MALES. PARTICIPATING THEN -- FEMALES SO BIG THING IS LET'S TALK MONEY IS SO AGAIN WITH THE WHEN THIS IS WHAT THE SURVEY I SENT OUT -- IT WAS -- OVERWHELMINGLY I THINK THERE'S ONE PROGRAM THAT SAID THAT BASKETBALL WAS THEIR NUMBER ONE PRODUCING REVENUE. FOOTBALL WAS NUMBER ONE FOR EVERYBODY SO THAT'S WHERE THE MONEY MAKER IS AND MY DISTRICT THEN OUT AND A LOT OF OTHER DISTRICTS. FOOTBALL REVENUE PAYS FOR TOURNAMENTS OFFICIALS THAT'S WHAT THAT'S WHERE YOUR BANK IS SO -- MY ASSUMPTION IS MORE TIME MONEY AND EFFORT IS TYPICALLY SPENT ON FOOTBALL -- IT'S NOT A GREAT THING TO SEE BUT AS AN ATHLETIC DIRECTOR I KNOW WHEN FROM FRIDAY NIGHT COMES THERE'S A LOT THAT GOES INTO IT YOU HAVE TO ALIGN YOUR OFFICIALS -- SECURITY -- CROWD CONTROL ARE YOU HAVING OF EVENT THAT NIGHT TO PER. YOUR ELEMENTARY SCHOOL -- THERE'S JUST A LOT OF THAT GOES INTO FOOTBALL WHICH IS YOUR NUMBER ONE PRODUCING A LOT OF TIMES FOOTBALLS. YOUR SCHOOL LIKE THAT'S WHAT REPRESENTED REPRESENTS YOUR SCHOOL IS YOUR FOOTBALL TEAM -- IT'S NOT GREAT TO SEE -- BUT WHEN THE FALL COMES THAT'S TYPICALLY WHAT HAPPENS -- AND BOYS BASKETBALL -- YOU CAN EARN A BASS BASKETBALL OR SOCCER THERE YOU CAN COMPARE THE TWO SO THAT'S KINDA WHAT I MEAN ABOUT EQUALITY IS YOU CAN COMPARE BUT THERE'S REALLY NO. THE MOST MORE THAT COMPARES TO FOOTBALL AND THEN -- I DID WANT TO KNOW WHAT THE SAUDIS FOR PLAYOFFS IN THE CENTRAL SECTION WE ARE ACTUALLY MOVING AND I KNOW BASEBALL IS AT A MINOR LEAGUE FACILITY FOR BASEBALL AND THEN THAT WOULD HAPPEN FOR A YEAR AND THEN WE ACTUALLY MOVED. US OFF ALL TO THE PRESENT STATE MARTY RIGHT STADIUM SO THAT THAT'S COMPARATIVO I'M NOT SURE ABOUT. THROUGHOUT THE REST OF THE STATE WE ALSO HAVE A BASKETBALL PLAYOFFS AT HOME SO AN ARENA IN FRESNO AND THEN I KNOW THE STATE WE HAVE IT AT WAS KEPT COUPLE. ONE GOLDEN GOLDEN ONE THERE YOU GOT MORE THAN ONE CENTER SO IT WAS IT'S GREAT TO SEE THAT OUR OUR KIDS ARE ABLE TO GO INTO THOSE SITUATIONS AND PLAY AND FACILITIES THAT. ARE -- NOT JUST SPECIFIC TO THEIR SCHOOL -- BUT I KNOW THE CENTRAL SECTION HAS SAID WOULD THEY MAKE MORE MONEY WHEN IT'S AT THESE FACILITIES BECAUSE YOU HAVE ALL THE SPORTS IN ONE AREA SO AGAIN SOMETIMES THAT'S MONEY DRIVEN -- I ALSO IN THE SURVEY I ASKED HOW MANY SCHOOLS WERE IN MARIN MEASURES AND THERE'S ABOUT MEASURES. THAT WERE BEING USED TOWARDS ATHLETICS SO -- WHEN YOU LOOK AT BUDGETS -- LIKE YOU SAID WAS A THEY'RE LOOKING TO THE COMMUNITIES TO TO FIND THESE NEWS NEW FACILITIES. I NOT MY SCHOOL -- WE HAVE THE OUR FACILITIES ARE VERY OLD AND SO I KNOW IN THE FUTURE THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO LOOK TO BECAUSE THEY'RE EXPENSIVE AND WE DO WANT. TO YOU KNOW HAVE NO A A SUPPLE STADIUM BECAUSE WE HAVE A BASEBALL -- ONE WE ARE STUDENTS BACKYARD OUR KIDS PLAY BECAUSE IT'S FUN -- AND WE NEED TO PROVIDE EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES EQUAL -- FACILITIES FOR A KID SO ACCOMPLISHMENTS. AGAIN OUR PARTICIPATION RATES ARE UP -- UPGRADES ARE HAPPENING BUT AGAIN IT'S NOT AT THE RATE THAT WE NEED TO SEE IT SO WE NEED -- TO INCREASE THAT AND THEN. THE COMPLAINTS OFFICER IS GREAT TO SEE I'VE SEEN AS AN ATHLETIC DIRECTOR MY ASSISTANT SUPERINTENDENT IS COMING TO ME MAKING SURE THAT I HAVE ALL OF MY SERVICE FILLED OUT AND WE GO THROUGH THINGS AND IT'S GREAT. AS AN ATHLETIC DIRECTOR BECAUSE IT'S I HAVE SOMEBODY THERE REMINDING ME SO THAT'S A POSITIVE. COMING FROM MY POSITION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR AND NOW. RE INTRODUCED -- CAM TURNER. AND THE THANK YOU SO MUCH AND THANK YOU TO THE COMMITTEE FOR HAVING US HERE TODAY. HI MY NAME IS KIM TURNER AND I'M A SENIOR STAFF ATTORNEY FOR FAIR PLAY FOR GIRLS IN SPORTS A PROJECT OF OUR ONE HUNDRED YEAR OLD NONPROFIT. ORGANIZATION LEGAL AID AT WORK BASED IN SAN FRANCISCO. I'M ALSO PLEASED TO BE HERE BECAUSE ON A PERSONAL NOTE I TITLE NINE A DEBT OF GRATITUDE I PLAYED DIVISION ONE VOLLEYBALL IN COLLEGE AT BROWN UNIVERSITY. AND WOULD NOT HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO PLAY BUT FOR THE LAW THEY WERE ABOUT TO ELIMINATE THE VOLLEYBALL WOMEN'S PROGRAM AND SEVERAL OTHER WOMEN SPORTS PROGRAMS IN THE NINETIES AND THE PROGRAM I PLAYED FOR AND THE OTHER WOMEN SPORTS PERCEIVED BY. A GROUP OF COURAGEOUS WOMEN WHO SAID NO WE ARE JUST AS IMPORTANT AS FOOTBALL AND EVERY OTHER SPORT IN THIS UNIVERSITY AND WE CANNOT USE FEDERAL FUNDS TO DISCRIMINATE SO THANK YOU TITLE NINE PERSONALLY -- SO THROUGH LITIGATION EDUCATION AND POLICY WORK WE ADVOCATE AT FAIR PLAY FOR GENDER EQUALITY WITH A SPECIFIC FOCUS ON AN EQUITY IN ATHLETICS FOR THE THREE MILLION GIRLS IN GRADES K. THROUGH TWELVE ACROSS CALIFORNIA. WE'VE SEEK TO BRING ABOUT EQUITY FOR GIRLS USING TITLE NINE AND RELATED CALIFORNIA LAW. PARTICULARLY THOSE -- FOR THOSE IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AND GIRLS OF COLOR WHO STATISTICALLY HAVE THE FEWEST SPORTS OPPORTUNITIES IN COMPARISON TO THE U. SPEARS. AND WE WORKED IN THE STATE FOR OVER FIFTEEN YEARS ON TITLE NINE MATTERS REPRESENTING GIRLS AND THEIR FAMILIES OR SCHOOLS ARE REATING GIRLS AS A SECOND CLASS THESE GIRLS ARE STANDING UP TO MAKE CHANGE WITH OUR ASSISTANCE. AND FAIR PLAY FURTHER PROVIDES TRAINING AND TECHNICAL HELP. AND LEGISLATIVE ADVOCACY TO MOVE TOWARD THE GOAL OF GENDER EQUITY FOR OUR STUDENTS ONCE AND FOR ALL AND I JUST WANT TO ADVERTISE THAT ANYONE IN THIS ROOM WHO WANTS A TITLE NINE TRAINING. WE'RE READY TO DO IT BECAUSE I THINK AS ALL TALK ABOUT A LITTLE BIT MORE THERE'S SOME MISUNDERSTANDING ABOUT HOW THE LAW WORKS AND WE NEED TO CHANGE THAT. SO DESPITE GREAT STRIDES WITH TITLE NINE APPROACHING ITS FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY UNFORTUNATELY MILLIONS OF GIRLS NATIONWIDE AND IN CALIFORNIA ARE BEING SIMPLY TREATED WORSE THAN THE BOYS. SO LIKE A ONE LIKE A YOUNG WOMAN IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WHO SOUGHT THE HELP OF FAIR PLAY BECAUSE IN HER WORDS AND HER PUBLIC SCHOOL. IT WAS LACKING RESOURCES FOR GIRLS WHILE PUTTING BOYS ON A PEDESTAL AND GIVING THEM THE BEST FACILITIES. ACTORS ASSERTING A TITLE NINE COMPLAINT AGAINST HER SCHOOL CHANGES WERE MADE TO IMPROVE AN EQUALIZED GIRLS ATHLETICS THERE AND SHE SAID TITLE NINE GIVE GIRLS THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHINE. JUST AS MUCH AS THE BOYS. THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE TODAY AND I THINK WE HAVE TO KEEP REMEMBERING THAT. SO WHAT EXACTLY IS THIS PROBLEM OF ATHLETIC INEQUITY WHY DOES IT MATTER AND WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO ABOUT IT AFTER TODAY. EVERY DAY IN CALIFORNIA OUR ELEMENTARY MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOLS ARE TELLING GIRLS YOU CAN DO ANYTHING IF YOU STUDY HARD FOR ALL THE RULES AND GRADUATE. THE GIRLS ARE ALSO GETTING A CORROSIVE MESSAGE FROM SCHOOLS THAT THEY DON'T COUNT AS MUCH AS THEIR MALE PEERS ON OUR KEY TOLD CAMPUSES. IN THE WORDS OF ANOTHER FAIR PLAY KLEIN IN HIGH SCHOOL I FEEL LIKE I'M LEFT OUT AND CONSTANTLY HAVING TO FIGHT FOR MY EQUITY AND WORK FIVE TIMES HARDER FOR THE OPPORTUNITIES AND SUCCESSES THAT I WANT AS AN ATHLETE. IT FEELS LIKE WE GIRLS DON'T MATTER AS MUCH. SO FOR EXAMPLE ACROSS THE STATE SCHOOLS ARE AFFORDING BOYS LARGER MORE UP TO DATE ATHLETIC LOCKER ROOMS AND ACCESS TO THE PREFERRED JAMS AND FIELDS AND IN CONTRAST GIRLS HAVE SMALLER LOCKER ROOMS WITH LESS AMENITIES OR NO LOCKER ROOM AT ALL. AND THEY HAVE THE WORST ATHLETIC FACILITIES FOR PRACTICE AND PLAY. NO I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR AND WANT TO DO A QUICK POINT OF EDUCATION HERE TO MY CO PANELISTS WHO VERY CAREFULLY AND AND HOPEFULLY TALK ABOUT WHAT WHAT THEY'RE SEEING. TREATMENT IN BENEFITS IS ONE AREA OF TITLE NINE SO WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE WHOLE ATHLETIC PROGRAM AND LOOK AT WHAT ALL THE BOYS AND ALL THE GIRLS ARE GETTING ON THEIR DIFFERENT TEAMS. VERY CLEARLY TITLE NINE IN THE REGULATION SAY THERE'S NO EXCEPTION FOR FOOTBALL IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU HAVE A HUNDRED BOYS PLAYING FOOTBALL. YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S EQUITABLE TREATMENT BENEFITS FOR THE GIRLS ON THE GIRLS SIDE. IT'S OKAY TO HAVE A MORE EXPENSIVE FOOTBALL UNIFORMS BUT THE SOFTBALL GIRLS NEED TO HAVE A TOP NOTCH UNIFORM AS WELL AND ALL THE ELEMENTS FOR THE SUPPORT THAT THEY NEED SAME WITH THE SWIMMERS. SAME WITH FIELD HOCKEY WHATEVER IT MAY BE FOOTBALL GREAT SPORT NOT AGAINST IT WE JUST WANNA MAKE IT CLEAR THAT THERE IS NO FOOTBALL EXCEPTION IN TITLE NINE AND WE HEAR THAT TOO OFTEN FROM SCHOOLS. THAT THERE'S NO WAY AROUND IT. AS THE OPPORTUNITIES TO PLAY A GIRLS MAKE UP HALF OF OUR CALIFORNIA STUDENT BODY AND RESEARCH CLEARLY SHOWS THEY WANT TO PLAY SPORTS AS MUCH AS THE BOYS ESPECIALLY IF THE SPORTS ARE OFFERED IN THE RIGHT WAY. SO THAT MEANS IF YOU HEAR AN ATHLETIC DIRECTOR SAY NO GIRLS AT THE SCHOOL WANTED TO PLAY SOFTBALL AND THEN YOU FIND OUT THAT THE SOFTBALL FIELD IS UNDER THE FREEWAY. AND THE BOYS BASEBALL FIELD THE CENTRAL CAMPUS THERE'S A REASON THEY'RE NOT PLANNING SO I CAN'T WAIT FOR THOSE UPGRADED FACILITIES TO COME BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE AND PARTICIPATION. AND THEN IF GIRLS HAVE EQUAL FACILITIES KNOWLEDGEABLE COACHES IN THE SCHOOL SUPPORT THEY WILL COME. BUT OUR EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS ARE OFFERING FEWER SUPPORT PROGRAMS AND FEWER LEVELS OF SPORTS IN COMPARISON TO GIRLS. AND IN COMPARISON TO BOYS AND SO IF YOU HAVE A HUNDRED BOYS ON THE FOOTBALL PROGRAM. YOU PROBABLY HAVE A LOT OF GIRLS THAT WANT TO PLAY VOLLEYBALL BUT YOU ONLY HAVE ONE TEAM OR TWO YOU COULD HAVE FIVE LEVELS OF VOLLEYBALL THESE DAYS YOU COULD HAVE THREE LEVELS OF STOP ALL THESE DAYS THE GIRLS WANT TO PLAY. BUT THE INFRASTRUCTURE FROM THE SCHOOL HAS TO BE BUILT. SO AS MY COLLEAGUE RODGER BLAKE DISCUSSED WOULD WE EVER GIVE FEMALE STUDENTS FEWER DUSTIN BOYS IN THE CLASSROOM OR GIVE GIRLS OLDER BOOKS IN COMPARISON TO BOYS OR SIGN GIRLS TEACHERS WHO DIDN'T KNOW MATH AS WELL AS TEACHERS WORKING WITH BOYS. WHY ARE WE DONE GIVING GIRLS FEWER ATHLETIC ROSTER SPOTS IN COMPARISON TO BOYS WHO HAVE AT LEASTA HUNDRED THOUSAND MORE SLOTS ON TEAMS IN CALIFORNIA? WHY ARE WE GIVING GIRLS OLDER INFERIOR ATHLETIC UNIFORMS THAT THEIR SEWING THEMSELVES THE SOFTBALL PANTS WITH HOLES WHILE THE BOYS ARE GETTING SIX SETS OF UNIFORMS IN THEIR BASEBALL PROGRAM? ONE OF THE MAIN CAMERA COLORS. AND WHY ARE WE GIVING BOYS MORE EQUIPMENT AND NICER EQUIPMENT IN COMPARISON TO GIRLS TEAMS. AND THEN FINALLY WIRE WE ASSIGNING GIRLS TEAMS COACHES WHO SOMETIMES HAVE NEVER EVEN PLAYED THE SPORT ON THE GIRLS TEAM WHERE IS BOYS COACHES ALL TOO OFTEN WERE ONCE PROFESSIONALS IN THEIR GAME. AND TO ANYONE WHO SAYS WELL IT'S THE BOOSTER CLUBS TIPPING THE SCALES WOULD WE EVER ALLOW SOMEONE LIKE BILL GATES TO DONATE COMPUTERS JUST TO THE BOYS BUT NOT TO THE GIRLS. NO SO WE NEED TO STOP THE PRACTICE OF ALLOWING SCHOOLS AND WIDER COMMUNITIES TO SUPPORT BOYS SPORTS OVER GIRLS SPORTS PERIOD. NO EXCEPTIONS. ATHLETICS IN SCHOOL IS ABOUT LEARNING AND GROWING AND EVERY STUDENT DESERVES THE SAME CHANCE TO PLAN FLOURISH REGARDLESS OF GENDER. FURTHER A SCHOOL'S ATHLETIC PROGRAM IS A MICROCOSM OF SOCIETY WHERE WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TEACH GIRLS AND BOYS ABOUT GENDER EQUITY. WE MUST EXEMPLIFY EQUITY AND FOSTER FAIRNESS THROUGHOUT EDUCATION SO THAT THESE STUDENTS WILL GO INTO THE WORLD AND THE WORKPLACE HAVING LEARNED AND ABSORB THAT EQUITY IS THE LAW AND IT'S WHAT'S RIGHT FROM THE START. WHAT EXACTLY DOES EQUITY MATTER IN ATHLETICS WHY ARE WELL FOR ONE GIRLS WHO PLAY SPORTS ARE HEALTHIER PHYSICALLY MENTALLY AND THEY GRADUATED HIGHER RATES? BUT FEMALE ATHLETES WHO PLAYED IN HIGH SCHOOL GO ON TO EARN 7% HIGHER WE JUST AS ADULTS REGARDLESS OF ANY OTHER THING OR VARIABLE IN THEIR BACKGROUND. SO THIS IS ABOUT MORE THAN FUNNY GAMES IT'S A DOLLARS AND CENTS ESPECIALLY FOR GIRLS SEEKING ECONOMIC MOBILITY. USING THE LESSONS AND EXPERIENCES THAT THEY LEARNED IN SPORTS TO BETTER THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES AND THEIR COMMUNITIES WITHOUT LARGER PAYCHECK. NOW WE KNOW THAT THERE IS AN EPIDEMIC PROBLEM OF INEQUITY IN OUR SCHOOLS THINGS ARE GETTING BETTER AS MY COLLEAGUES POINTED OUT BUT WE ARE NOT AT THE FINISH LINE YET. THERE ARE THREE THINGS THAT FAIR PLAY RECOMMENDS THAT WE DO TO TAKE ACTION. FROM IN TERMS OF THE CALIFORNIA INTERSCHOLASTIC FEDERATION THE OFFICE FOR CIVIL RIGHTS THE CALIFORNIA AG'S OFFICE EVERYBODY HERE TODAY CAN HELP. THE LAWMAKERS HERE AND IN WASHINGTON AND ALL OF OUR ALLIES AROUND THE ROOM. NUMBER ONE TRAINING WE MUST ALSO DECIDE TIME AND RESOURCES TO PROPERLY TRAIN THE SUPERINTENDENTS PRINCIPALS COACHES TEACHERS STUDENTS FAMILIES ON WHAT TITLE IN ATHLETICS ACTUALLY EQUITY IN ATHLETICS ACTUALLY MEANS AND LOOKS LIKE IN OUR SCHOOLS. AND I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT A TRAINING WHERE IT'S A WEAPON ARE YOU SIT BACK AND YOU GET ON YOUR PHONE YOU DON'T PAY ATTENTION BECAUSE WE SADLY SEE THAT TOO OFTEN WITHOUT. A POLITIC DIRECTORS IN LITIGATION SAY I WAS TRAINED ON TITLE NINE AND I DON'T REMEMBER WORD OF IT. OKAY WE NEED TO INSTILL THAT THIS IS ACTUALLY IMPORTANT AND THESE TRAINING RESOURCES TO ROGER'S POINT ALREADY EXIST BUT THEY NEED TO BE FURTHER DEVELOPED AND THEY NEED TO BE EFFECTIVELY APPLIED. AND TRAINING CAN ONLY WORK IN INSTITUTIONS THAT ESTABLISH THAT EQUITY IS THE NON NEGOTIABLE ORDER OF THE DAY. SO NOT ONLY DOES THE ATHLETIC DIRECTOR NEED TO PROPERLY UNDERSTAND TITLE NINE COMPLIANCE AFFORDING GIRLS ENOUGH TEAMS ROTATING LOCKER ROOMS WHEN ONE IS INFERIOR. AND PRACTICE TIMES AND AND GAME TIMES FOR EQUITY. THEY NEED TO MAKE IT HAPPEN DAY IN AND DAY OUT SUPPORTING IN THEIR SPIRIT AND IN THE RESOURCES THAT IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT BOYS FOOTBALL IN THAT BIG GAME AND THE PEP RALLY ONLY FOR BOYS. WE'RE GONNA HAVE A PEP RALLY FOR GIRLS SOFTBALL WE'VE HAD SITUATIONS WHERE CA YEP. YOU KNOW GIRLS TEAMS HAVE WON C. I. F. STATE CHAMPIONSHIPS AND NO ONE AT THE SCHOOL KNOWS ABOUT IT SO WE NEED TO CHANGE THAT. SECOND WE NEED TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH EXISTING MANDATE SO AS ROGER MENTIONED EARLIER SB THIRTEEN FORTY NINE REQUIRES K. TWELVE SCHOOLS TO REPORT ON HOW MANY GIRLS AND BOYS ARE PLAYING. HALF OF THE SCHOOLS ARE REPORTING WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE A 100% BECAUSE JUST LIKE WE WANT TO KNOW HOW THE SCHOOLS PERFORMING ACADEMICALLY FOR OUR STUDENTS WE WANT TO KNOW IF WE'RE GONNA CENTER SON AND DAUGHTER TO THAT SCHOOL. pTHEY'RE GOING TO GET THE SAME ATHLETIC RESOURCES. AND THEN WE ALSO NEED THIRD. TO PUT THE BURDEN ON OURSELVES AND OUR INSTITUTIONS AND AGENCIES NONPROFITS AND LEADERS TO MAKE THESE CHANGES AND NOT THE BURDEN ON THE GIRLS. BECAUSE TOO OFTEN WE'RE SAYING TO THESE GIRLS YOU NEED TO MAKE THE COMPLAINT YOU NEED TO STICK YOUR NECK OUT IN MIDDLE SCHOOL IN HIGH SCHOOL I DON'T KNOW IF YOU REMEMBER HIGH SCHOOL BUT USUALLY YOU DON'T WANT TO BE IN FEDERAL COURT IF YOU CAN AVOID IT. BECAUSE YOU'RE DEALING WITH A LOT OF OTHER THINGS. SO SHOULDN'T THESE GIRLS BE SPENDING THEIR TIME STUDYING LEARNING PREPARING FOR COLLEGE AND NOT PREPARING A COMPLAINT. TO CALL DEPARTMENT OF ED OR OCR. FOR TO A FEDERAL COURT SO LET'S NOT PUT THE GROUP BURDEN ON GIRLS AND INSTEAD LET'S USE OUR RESOURCES TODAY AMONGST OURSELVES TO EXPAND AND UTILIZE TITLE NINE GUIDANCE TO ASSESS FOR INEQUITY. QUICKLY BRING THE PROBLEMS TO LIGHT NOT IN FIFTY MORE YEARS TODAY THIS WEEK THIS MONTH THIS YEAR AND CREATE A TRULY LEVEL PLAYING FIELD ONCE AND FOR ALL BECAUSE TIME'S UP ON DISCRIMINATION IN EDUCATION. THANK YOU. HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. LEARN MUCH OF A WILL ALSO A VOLLEYBALL DEMONSTRATION LATER FOR YOUR PASSION AND ON BEHALF OF MY SIX YEAR OLD GRANDDAUGHTER I ALSO WANNA. THANK ALL OF YOU HERE AND THE PANELISTS TO FOR YOU FOR YOUR WORK AND AND AND THIS -- EQUITY ISSUE -- SURE BLOOM DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FOR THE PANELISTS. QUESTIONS BUT I WILL I WANT TO THANK ALL THE PARTICIPANTS TODAY -- FOR ENLIGHTENING US ON ON THESE VERY IMPORTANT ISSUES AND OF CLEARLY ARE ALL PASSIONATE ABOUT -- ABOUT THESE ISSUES AND YOU SHOULD BE AND WE ALL SHOULD BE BECAUSE THE QUALITY IS THE WATCH WORD OF THE DAY AND WE'RE NOT THERE YET AND AND WE NEED TO WORK HARD TO GET THERE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SHALL CONSIDER US AS YOUR PARTNER. I HAVE A QUESTION FOR A CUTTING.
