REALLY APPRECIATED MEANS LET ME

00:15:34.033 --> 00:15:35.601
THINK OKAY THAT'S RIGHT EXACTLY

00:15:35.668 --> 00:15:37.236
BECAUSE RUSSIA WERE ENTERED OVER

00:15:37.303 --> 00:15:42.141
TO CENTRE BELL -- LIKE WE PASSED

00:15:42.207 --> 00:15:43.909
A STATUTE.

00:15:43.976 --> 00:15:46.245
I THINK IT WAS SB -- A TEN THAT --

00:15:46.312 --> 00:15:47.446
CREATED THE HOMEOWNER BILL

00:15:47.513 --> 00:15:48.981
RIGHTS.

00:15:49.048 --> 00:15:50.816
AND IT MADE THE HOMEOWNER BILL

00:15:50.883 --> 00:15:51.283
OF RIGHTS.

00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:53.052
PERMANENT.

00:15:53.118 --> 00:15:54.353
PREVIOUSLY THE HOMEOWNER BILL

00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:58.090
RICE WAS A TIME LIMITED.

00:15:58.157 --> 00:15:59.391
WITH THE SUNSET.

00:15:59.458 --> 00:16:00.659
AND THEN WE PASSED A LAW THE

00:16:00.726 --> 00:16:03.595
STATUTE -- TO MAKE IT A

00:16:03.662 --> 00:16:05.564
PERMANENT.

00:16:05.631 --> 00:16:06.665
LAW.

00:16:06.732 --> 00:16:08.534
SO I KIND OF WONDER WHY I HAD

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:10.669
THE SAME QUESTION WHY IS THIS I

00:16:10.736 --> 00:16:12.805

00:29:00.071 --> 00:29:00.939
IMPORTANT THAT PEOPLE HAVE

00:29:01.005 --> 00:29:02.540
CERTAIN CERTAINTY WHEN THEY'RE

00:29:02.607 --> 00:29:04.809
ENGAGING AND DEVELOPMENT.

00:29:04.876 --> 00:29:06.211
I'M PARTICULARLY WHEN WE HAVE A

00:29:06.277 --> 00:29:08.313
THREE POINT FIVE MILLION HOME --

00:29:08.379 --> 00:29:10.248

00:29:10.315 --> 00:29:11.883
STRANGLING THE STATE AND WE'VE

00:29:19.357 --> 00:29:20.658
UNBELIEVABLE HOW HOMELESSNESS IS

00:29:20.725 --> 00:29:22.460
BY DOING AROUND THE STATE IN

00:29:22.527 --> 00:29:25.163
THAT 71% OF HOMELESS PEOPLE ON

00:29:25.230 --> 00:29:26.764

THE STEREO TYPE THAT WE HEAR.

00:29:30.168 --> 00:29:31.936
MOST ALMOST PEOPLE SIMPLY CAN'T

HOUSING TO BE BUILT -- AND SO WE

00:29:37.375 --> 00:29:40.478
HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT -- SEQUEL

00:29:40.545 --> 00:29:41.746
IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT LAW BUT IF

00:29:41.813 --> 00:29:42.747
YOUTO MAKE SURE THAT'S BEING

00:29:42.814 --> 00:29:44.449
APPLIED IN A RATIONAL WAY IN THE

00:29:44.516 --> 00:29:45.650
PEOPLE CAN RELY.

00:29:45.717 --> 00:29:47.919
ON THESE PLANS AND ACTUALLY

00:29:47.986 --> 00:29:49.420
BUILD HOUSING AND NOT HAVE THE

RUG PULLED OUT FROM UNDER THEM

00:29:51.322 --> 00:29:52.690

00:29:54.759 --> 00:30:01.799
WOULD LIKE TO GET A SEAT PLEASE

00:30:01.866 --> 00:30:02.734
MISTER VICE CHAIR.

00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:04.402
THE TECHNICAL QUESTION SINCE I'M

00:30:04.469 --> 00:30:05.270
NOT A LAWYER MISTER CHAIR -- IF

00:30:05.336 --> 00:30:05.570
[inaudible]

00:30:05.637 --> 00:30:06.938
SOMEONE.

00:30:07.005 --> 00:30:08.273
GOES TO A JUDGE AND ASKED FOR A

00:30:08.339 --> 00:30:08.673
STATE [inaudible]

00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:11.309
BUT THAT'S THEY CAN'T BE HONORED.

00:30:11.376 --> 00:30:11.976
WHAT'S THE POINT OF GOING TO THE

00:30:12.043 --> 00:30:13.444
JUDGE SO THE STATE IS NOT ON IT

00:30:13.511 --> 00:30:15.079
AN INDIVIDUAL PROJECT THAT WOULD

00:30:15.146 --> 00:30:17.048
BE DIFFERENT THIS IS A STAY ON

00:30:17.115 --> 00:30:18.483
THE ENTIRE GENERAL PLAN.

00:30:18.550 --> 00:30:20.084
AND THE REASON IS BECAUSE THE

00:30:20.151 --> 00:30:21.753
PLAN HAS ALREADY GONE THROUGH IN

00:30:21.819 --> 00:30:23.087
THIS CASE OF LOS ANGELES

00:30:23.154 --> 00:30:25.156
MULTIPLE YEARS OF COMMUNITY

00:30:25.223 --> 00:30:26.324
INVOLVEMENT.

00:30:26.391 --> 00:30:28.693
NEIGHBORHOOD COUNCIL HEARINGS.

00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:30.662
EVERYTHING ELSE THEN THE PLAN

00:30:30.728 --> 00:30:32.730
GETS ADOPTED LEGALLY THE PLAN IS

00:30:32.797 --> 00:30:33.965
IN EFFECT.

00:30:34.032 --> 00:30:35.567
A DEVELOPER GOES AND PUTS

00:30:35.633 --> 00:30:37.769
FORWARD THEIR PROJECT MAYBE ALSO

00:30:37.835 --> 00:30:40.705
DOES YEARS OF COMMUNITY MEETINGS.

00:30:40.772 --> 00:30:42.674
THE PLAN IS APPROVED AT THAT

00:30:42.740 --> 00:30:44.142
POINT A JUDGE LET'S SAY

00:30:44.209 --> 00:30:45.310
SOMEONE'S NOW SUE THE GENERAL

00:30:45.376 --> 00:30:46.945
PLAN THE JUDGE SAYS WE'RE GOING

00:30:47.011 --> 00:30:48.413
TO PUT THE ENTIRE GENERAL PLAN

00:30:48.479 --> 00:30:49.747
ON HOLD WILL THAT PROJECTS IS

00:30:49.814 --> 00:30:51.416
ALREADY GONE THROUGH THE PROCESS

00:30:51.482 --> 00:30:52.817
UNDER A LEGALLY BINDING PLAN.

00:30:52.884 --> 00:30:54.085
WE THINK THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO

00:30:54.152 --> 00:30:55.753
BUILD AT THAT POINT IF THEY ARE

00:30:55.820 --> 00:30:56.888
DEEMED COMPLETE NOT IF THEY'VE

00:30:56.955 --> 00:30:58.523

00:30:59.257 --> 00:31:00.291
ENTITLEMENTS.

00:31:00.358 --> 00:31:01.693
THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO CONTINUE

00:31:01.759 --> 00:31:03.428
EVEN IF THE PLAN -- HUSBAND

00:31:03.494 --> 00:31:05.630
STAYED BECAUSE THEY GOT CAUGHT

00:31:05.697 --> 00:31:07.532

KNOW HAVE TO BEAR KIND OF THE

00:31:12.670 --> 00:31:14.172
RESULT OF THAT GIVEN THAT DURING

00:31:14.239 --> 00:31:17.375
THEIR APPROVAL PROCESS THE PLAN

00:31:17.442 --> 00:31:18.776
WAS NOT STATE.
