OKAY THERE ARE FOR THE REAL ID AND- ON CHRISTMAS SUPPOSED WI FI OUT OF THE. FOR THE OPERATION ON. I AM CUSTOMERS AND I. T. IMPROVE IT'S REASONABLE AND IF WITH THE AND THAT YOU'LL BE THAT EVALUATIONS OF THE DEPART. INDEPENDENT SAID THAT THE ADDITIONAL RETORTED HOW HAD POSITIVE AND ON DEPARTMENT OPERATE. HOWEVER WE FIND THAT THE PART ESTIMATE OF THE TEMP FIELDS OFFICE STAFF REQUIRED AND THE ABILITY ACOSTA ADDRESSING REAL ID WORKLOAD ARE HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON SEVERAL FACTORS SOME OF WHICH ARE FAIRLY UNCERTAIN. THE FACTORS INCLUDE POTENTIAL FEDERAL REGULATORY CHANGE AS CHANGES IN CUSTOMER BEHAVIOR IN A PANDEMIC- AND LONGER TERM CUSTOMER PREFERENCES. FOR ONLINE SERVICES. WE RECOMMEND IT LET'S APPROVED PROVISION ANTHONY FOR SERVICE OPERATIONS IN I CAME. TOTALING ABOUT ELEVEN MILLION AND HUNDRED TWENTY THREE ACTIVISION'S IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY Q. AND WE FIND THAT THESE POSITIONS ARE CONSISTENT WITH ASSESSMENT OF THE DEPARTMENT'S PREVIOUS OPERATION OFFICER COMING AND WILL ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT TO MAINTAIN THE PROGRESS. MADE TO DATE- AND WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE APPROVEDONLY BUDGET YEAR POSITIONS AND FUNDING FOR REAL ID OF WORKLOAD AND GIVEN THE WORKLOAD UNCERTAINTY WE RECOMMEND ONLY APPROVING A HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE POINT ONE MILLION AND THE FOURTEEN NINETY THREE POSITIONS FOR REAL ID WORK BUT IN TWENTY ONE ST. AND THIS WAY THE LEGISLATURE COULD PROVIDE AN ADDITIONAL OVERSIGHT OF THE DEPARTMENT OR BECAUSE I REQUIRED TO COME BACK NEXT YEAR WITH A NEW FUNDING PROPOSAL WHICH COULD BE. INFORMED BY ANOTHER YEAR OF DATA ON CUSTOMER BEHAVIOR AND POSSIBLE. FEDERAL ACTION. AND THAT IS ALL ABOUT COMMON. THANK YOU VERY MUCH DO WE HAVE COMMENTS FROM- THE A DEPARTMENT FINANCE. YES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS SMACK IN THE STUDIO WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. REGARDING THE MOTOR VEHICLE ACCOUNT. I'LL JUST ADD THAT- THE MINISTRATIONS CONSTANTLY MONITORING THIS FUND BOB WE HAVE WORKED WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO KEEP. THE FUND BALANCE AT. ABOUT A HUNDRED MILLION- AND WE'VE DONE THAT FOR THE NEXT THREE YEARS- AS NOTED BY THE LA OF. IT PROJECTEDTO BECOME INSOLVENT AND TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE BUT WE WILL CONTINUE TO SEARCH FOR SOLUTIONS AND MONITOR THAT AS WE APPROACH THAT FIGURE- IN REGARDS TO BE REAL ID AND OPERATIONAL IMPROVEMENTS- RECOMMENDATION BY THE L. A. O. I AGREE THAT THERE IS UNCERTAINTY REGARDING. THE LADY ESPECIALLY IN A PANDEMIC AND THE PERIPHERAL REGULATIONS HOWEVER. WE KNOW THAT THE DEMAND STILL EXISTS. IF PEOPLE START TRAVELING AGAIN YEAH. THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO GO GET A REAL ID- ENDED NINE RELATED RESOURCES AFTER TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO WILL LIMIT THE VISIBILITY TO PLAN FOR PROCESSING REAL IDEAS IN THE OUT YEARS. I NOTE THAT SHOULDN'T JUST BE NEEDED- IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE OR SOME OF THOSE OUT YEARS SIMILAR TO THIS YEAR'S BUDGET- THE BUDGET WILL CONTAIN LIKELY LANGUAGE THAT ALLOWS US TO ADJUST WITH NOTIFICATION- UNTIL LEGISLATURE. IN REGARDS TO PROVIDING ONLY THE FOUR TO NINETY THREE PREPOSITIONS- REQUESTED TO PROCESS REAL IDEAS AND TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO- I WOULD. BOB THAT THAT THAT WOULD HINDER DMV'S ABILITY TO. PROVIDE LIVE CHAT POSITIONS- RIGHT NOW CUSTOMERS CAN LOG IN DMV'S WEBSITE AND CHAT WITH A LIVE- INDIVIDUAL THAT CAN HELP THEM WITH OTHER TRANSACTIONS BESIDES REAL ID THAT HELPS KEEP PEOPLE OUT OF THE FIELD OFFICE WHICH REDUCES WAIT TIMES AND WE ALL. WANT TO REDUCE WAIT TIMES AT THE END BEACON PROCESS MORRELL ID'S- IT ALSO KIND OF REDUCES. THE INVISIBILITY TO ME KIND OF THE- AUDIT REQUIREMENTS OR AUTO SUGGESTIONS FROM- SAY AND BECAUSE OF OUR GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS AGENCIES. TRACK TEAM- KIND OF A RECORD. ON THAT- DMV NEEDED TO. HAVE A MORE COMPREHENSIVE MANAGEMENT OVER ITS FIELD OFFICES AND PART OF THE- SIXTEEN SIXTEEN POSITIONS SIXTEEN HUNDRED POSITIONS- WAS PROVIDING POSITIONS THAT HELPED. WITH THAT SO I WOULD ENCOURAGE LEGISLATURE TO APPROVE ALL SIXTEEN HUNDRED- TEMPERED DITIONS. SO I WONDER IF ONE OF YOU COULD- I EDUCATE US AS TO HOW MANY PEOPLE ACTUALLY RECEIVED A REAL IDEA AT THIS POINT AND TO- HOW MANY THE DMV ANTICIPATES. UP WILL BE ISSUED BETWEEN NOW AND OCTOBER. GOOD DEBT CHAIRMAN BLOOM THIS IS US STEVE GORDON DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT MOTOR VEHICLES I'LL TAKE THAT THE QUESTION I WORDS JUST UNDER TEN MILLION UNIQUE REAL IDEAS TODAY WE EXPECT WE NOW ON OCTOBER FIRST TO DO WE SHOULD OTHER SIX MILLION REAL ID'S. SO I THINK THAT'S THE ANSWER TO QUESTION ANOTHER SIX MILLION- AND WE EXPECT THAT TO BE KIND OF BACK END LOADED BECAUSE OF CODE RESTRICTIONS AS STUFF AS WAS MENTIONED EARLIER SO WE'RE GONNA SEE MORE OF THOSE LATER IN THE IN THE CALENDAR YEAR THEN SOONER. AND DIRECTOR GORDON IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU OUT THE TWO- ARE YOU THINK THAT THE RESOURCES THAT ARE IDENTIFIED IN THE BCP. OF WILL ALLOW YOU TO ACHIEVE THAT SIX MILLION DOLLARS SIX MILLION- IN REAL ID'S- BETWEEN NOW AND OCTOBER AND THEN- WHAT IS THE ANTICIPATED. NEED BEYOND. YEAH DO SERVE AS A AS THE GOT MADE THAT DO IT. A PEOPLE TO COULD TO SEEK REAL IDEAS AFTER THE DEADLINE WITHOUT A BE NOW BE THE NEW FEDERAL STOP FEDERAL AFTER OCTOBER FIRST. SO WE'RE STILL GOING TO HAVE ANOTHER TEN MILLION CALIFORNIA'S AFTER THE OCTOBER FIRST DEADLINE THAT ARE STILL GOING TO BE NEEDING TO. CONVERT AND TODAY BASED ON CURRENT LAW DHS I REQUIREMENTS. THAT REQUIRES AN IN OFFICE VISIT. A SELL OUT I DO BELIEVE THAT THIS. RESOURCES ARE ARE HELPFUL TO HAS TO BE ABLE TO BE EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE IN AND SERVING THESE CUSTOMERS. AND AS THAT LEASE GOT MENTIONED THAT WE'VE DONE A NUMBER OF IMPROVEMENTS SINCE WE LAST SPOKE. ABOUT THINGS THAT WILL SHORTEN THE IN OFFICE TIME ESPECIALLY NOW DURING COVERED WE WANT TO MINIMIZE THE AMOUNT OF TIME PEOPLE ARE ARE PRESENT. BUT WE'VE ALSO STREAMLINED. THE PROCESS SO THE PEOPLE ARE MORE EFFECTIVE SO WHEN THEY COME IN THE OFFICE- OVER BEFORE I STARTED THIS JOB OVER EIGHTEEN MONTHS AGO HE'S TAKE ABOUT TWENTY MINUTES FOR A REAL ID TRANSACTION. AND NOW WE'RE DOWN TO SUB TEN SO WE'RE CONTINUE TO MAKE IMPROVEMENTS AS THE BERMAN FINANCES MENTIONED. EVER CONTINUE TO STREAMLINE OUR OPERATION BECAUSE WE KNOW IT'S GOOD FOR CALIFORNIANS AND IT'S GOOD FOR US AS WELL. TO MINIMIZE THE NUMBER OF RESOURCES IN TOUCH POINTS WE HAPPEN THE PROCESS SO. YES I THINK WE GOT THE RESOURCES ARE. REQUIRED HOPE THERE WILL BE- WHERE I THINK WE HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT WE ARE SPENDING THE WELL AND MAKING SURE THAT IN FACT YOU CAN PROVE THE PROCESS FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. THAT DOES SOUND LIKE A GREAT IMPROVEMENT IN TERMS OF- A STREAMLINING CUT THE PROCESS- DOES THERE REMAIN AN ISSUE WITH RESPECT TO A- HI PROVIDING THE PUBLIC PROVIDING DOCUMENTATION. IN ORDER. TO FACILITATE REAL ID. UNFORTUNATELY THEY WERE. THAT SIR I. DO WE DO REQUIRE ARE THERE FOR- WELL NOT BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND OUR JOB IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE- OUR- IT'S ME THE- THINGS. AS A LEASE GOT MENTIONED THAT WE HAVE SOME TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS ARE USED. ABOUT HALF OF OUR CSES TODAY THAT COULD PRE VALIDATE THOSE DOCUMENTS TO THE CUSTOMER KNOWS BEFORE THEY COME IN. THAT THEY ARE PREPARED. AND HAVE THE RIGHT DOCUMENTS- READY FOR PRESENTATION. OUR OUR GOAL IS TO CONTINUE TO IMPROVE THAT PERCENTAGE OVER TIME THROUGH MESSAGING AND CAMPAIGNS. AND INCENTIVES TO GET PEOPLE IN A DIFFERENT SPOT IN LINE- BUT YES THE REQUIREMENTS SAID TO GET A REAL ID ARE ARE. SIGNIFICANT THAT NEED TO BE ABLE TO PRODUCE DOCUMENTS BIRTH CERTIFICATES. PASSPORTS AND SO ON MANY PEOPLE HAVE THOSE BUT NOT EVERYBODY HAS THAT READILY AVAILABLE. THERE IS A BEEN THERE HAS BEEN A CHANGE AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL THREE WOULD REDUCE THE NEED FOR A PHYSICAL SOCIAL SECURITY CARD. IN A NINE DIGIT SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER. SO THAT'S GOING TO STREAMLINE THINGS SOON BECAUSE MANY OF US JUST DON'T HAVE THAT DATA AND MANY OF US HAVE. THAT DATA MASK ON OUR ON OUR- YELP WELL. PACED UP AND SO ON SO IT WAS VERY HARD FOR PEOPLE TO YOU. TO PRESENT AT THAT WERE STARTING TO IMPLEMENT THAT NOW THAT'LL CONTINUE TO MAKE THE- IN OFFICE AS STEP MUCH MORE. EFFICIENT I'M NOT SAYING I'M A PACK RAT BUT- THE- FOR SOME REASON I STILL HAVE MY ORIGINAL SOCIAL SECURITY CARD. THE HOBBIT. PROBABLY SOMETHING NO NEEDS TO KNOW- WHAT IS THE A CAN YOU APPLY THOSE TO- AHEAD OF TIME AND IF SO WHAT'S THE PROCESS FOR DOING THAT. YEAH SO THAT YOU ACTUALLY CAN DO THAT SO THERE'S REALLY TWO STEP TODAY WE'RE DOING A PASSWORD ERE IMPROVING THAT PROCESS NOW TO TIGHTEN THOSE CONNECTIONS A ONE PART IS FILLING OUT. THE ONLINE APPLICATION WE AFFECTIONATELY REFER TO AS THE EDL FORTY FOUR THAT'S THE FORM FORTY FOUR FOR A DRIVER'S LICENSE THAT IS ESSENTIALLY YOUR APPLICATION IN THE APPLICATION THERE'S A MOTOR VOTER STEP IN SO THERE'S SOME FORM THAT HAS TO BE AT THE- END OF THAT PROCESS. WE WE DIDN'T SWITCH YOU OVER TO UPLOADING DOCUMENTS IT WILL ASK YOU WHICH DOCUMENTS YOU HAVE WILL BILL THE CHECKLIST FOR YOU AND THEY WILL ASK YOU TO DETERMINE HOW YOU WANT TO UPLOAD THOSE DOCUMENTS IT COULD BE FROM FILES YOU'VE STORED LOW FUNNY COMPUTER. OF COURSE YOU CAN DO IT ON A MOBILE DEVICE AS WELL. AS AS YOUR WHERE WE'VE DONE A NUMBER OF IMPROVEMENTS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A MOBILE FIRST STRATEGIES SO EVERYTHING THAT ALMOST EVERYTHING HE DID AT THE DMV YES STARTS WITH THE ABILITY TO DO IT FROM THE MOBILE DEVICE IN REAL TIME AND IN FACT- AS YOU VISIT YOUR LOCAL OFFICE SORRY VISIT ANY OFFICE. YOU'LL FIND THAT EVEN OUR OUR TRIAGE REPRESENTATIVES IN THE OFFICE WILL ADVISE CUSTOMERS ABOUT HOW THE DOCTORS TO GO AHEAD AND TAKE A PHOTO OF HIM RIGHT THEN AND THERE START THE JOURNEY SO WE CAN PRE VALIDATE THEM AND SAVE THEM TIME WHEN THEY GET TO THE WINDOW SO HE COULD DO A FROM. AT ANY TIME FROM DESKTOP FROM A MOBILE DEVICE HI IT'S FAIRLY GOOD COVERAGE I THINK VERY VERY GOOD COVERAGE ACROSS THE STATE USING THOSE TWO TECHNOLOGIES THANK YOU I HOPE THAT- THAT APPROACH TO TECHNOLOGY IS- BECOME SHARED BROADLY- THROUGH MANY AGENCIES BECAUSE- RIGHT NOW IT'S- CLIP WE NOT BUT BADLY. HIT MEMBERS SO. ARE THERE ANY. OTHER QUESTIONS. I'M SEEING NOT. SO WILL- THANK YOU ALL FOR. YOUR THIS. MORNING AND- WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON- WELL WE'RE ACTUALLY GONNA MOVE BACKWARDS IN THE AGENDA MOVE TO- ITEM SIX AND I'M GONNA TAKE A SHORT BREAK. MS RIVAS WILL TAKE OVER. YEAH. I CAN SAY. START SORRY OF ITEMS ZERO MISSION VEHICLE PROPOSAL WE HAVE- THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF THE ENERGY RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND DEVELOPMENT COMMISSION THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD- AND THE L. A. O. N. AND DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE BUT WE'LL START WITH OF THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION. THANK YOU AND GOOD MORNING. MY NAME IS PATTY MONAGHAN AND THE LEAD COMMISSIONER FOR TRANSPORTATION AT THE ENERGY COMMISSION- AND IT IS A PLEASURE TO BE HERE TO TALK ABOUT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AS IT RELATES TO THEIR MISSION VEHICLE FOR THAT IS THAT THE ELECTRICAL. SPEAKING TO ON THE- BOTH THE COMMISSION AND BE A RESOURCE FOR. OF THE WORLD OF THE ENERGY. AND THEIR ARE COMPLEMENTARY INSTINCTS WHEN IT COMES TO YOUR QUESTION CALLS. YOU SEE IT'S ONLY FOR IN. AND A BE WILL BE FOR A VEHICLE. OUR AGENCIES ARE CLOSELY. WHICH THIS A PUBLIC UTILITY COMMISSION AND OTHER THINGS AGENCIES TO SUPPORT TELEPHONE CALL UNDER TRANCE OTHER CRIME AND ENERGY GOALS. THE LAST YEAR IN THE WAY OF DEVASTATING. CAUSED IN PART BY WARMER. THE STATUS QUO THAT SET THE STAGE ON A CLEAR PATH. H. AND TRANSPORTATION. IN ORDER TO THE GOAL THAT HUNDRED PER OF NEW PATH VEHICLES WILL BE MISSION BY TWENTY FIVE. YEP SELFISH GOALS FOR POWER VEHICLES ADEQUATE. FOR THE INTERMISSION THE NEXT FIFTEEN TO TWENTY YEARS. I WOULD. BOTH THE CHILD AND OPPORTUNITIES TO ACHIEVE THESE AMBITIOUS TARGETS AND THE CRITICAL IMPORTANCE OF PRIORITIZING. AT THE EAST OUT. I'M EXCITED THAT GOVERNORS GOALS REALLY BUILD ON WHAT WE'RE SEEING HAPPENING AT THE GLOBAL LEVEL. SEVENTEEN COUNTRIES HAVE COMMITTED 21100% ELECTRIC VEHICLE FUTURE. IN JANUARY THE GOVERNOR OF MASSACHUSETTS FOLLOW BETTER NUISANCE LEAD AND SET THE SAME TARGET OF HAVING A 100% OF NEW PASSENGER VEHICLE SALES. IN EUROVISION BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE. AND. THREE THE GREETING CARE ALL FALL SUIT IN JANUARY GENERAL MOTORS BECAME THE FIRST AMERICAN CARMAKER TO SET THE GOAL CALIFORNIA REPRESENTS ELECTRIC VEHICLE BUT THIRTY THEN FORWARD ANNOUNCED YEAH IT WAS A LOT ALL THE PASSAGE OF THE- AND COMMERCIAL VEHICLE. IN THE E. U. I TRY THIRTY TO THE MOVE THE BAR UP IN THE YEAR WE OFFER HER SIMILAR TO ON ELECTRIC FROM VOLVO B. A CAR MAKE. SO THAT'S A REALLY STARTING TO THE MAIN. TODAY ARE FORTY SIX DIFFERENT MODELS OF ELECTRIC VEHICLE AVAILABLE AND MANY MORE ARE THE WAY. EARLY NEXT YEAR IS BRAINTREE WE AND ELECTED NOT MODEL AND IT SIGNATURE FORD F. ONE FIFTY TWO WHICH IS THE BEST SELLING CAR IN. AND ACCORDING TO FORD THIS IS AND HAVE THE BEST HORSE POWER THE BEST WORK AND THE BEST SIX CELEBRATION OF ANY OF ITS F. ONE FIFTY. SO YOU'RE YOU'RE EVEN GONNA BE ABLE TO CHART OUR TOOLS FROM THAT SO IT'S NOT LIKE YOU'RE COMPROMISING ON ON VEHICLE PERFORMANCE YOU'RE ACTUALLY. GETTING BETTER PERFORMANCE WITH THIS VEHICLE. AND WHEN IT COMES TO THEIR MISSION TRANSFER. AUTHORITY IT IS THE MISSION. THAT THE WERE OUR NUMBER ONE EXT LAST YEAR THERE'S THIRTY FOUR IS THAT MANUFACTURED THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY DECORATED COMPANY AND OVER SEVENTY THOUSAND JOBS IN THE STATE. IN THE SECTOR. NOW THE FOCUS ON THE PROPOSED BUDGET. SO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET WILL HELP THE STATE SCALE UP THEIR MISSION TRANSPORTATION AND OVERCOME KEY BARRIERS TO COMMERCIALIZING THEIR MISSION VEHICLE. SYSTEMICALLY THE BUDGET PROPOSES TO EXTEND THE ABA PROGRAM WHICH IS SET TO EXPIRE AT THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE. PROVIDE ABOUT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN INCENTIVES FOR ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES. GRANTS THE CVC BONDING AUTHORITY TO BE ABLE TO FRONT LOAD A BILLION DOLLARS OF INVESTMENT IN ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE INFRASTRUCTURE AND THAT'S BOTH FOR BATTERY ELECTRIC VEHICLES AND FUEL CELL ELECTRIC VEHICLES. AND I'D LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS SEEKING CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATION AUTHORITY. ONLY FOR FUNDING TO BUILD OUT THAT INFRASTRUCTURE TRINITY ENERGY COMMISSION MY AGENCIES CLEAN TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM. SO THIS DOESN'T APPLY TO ANY OF THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE MANAGED BY THE- BEFORE SUPPORT. I REQUEST FOR CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATION AUTHORITY IS BEING MADE TO MINIMIZE THE COST OF BORROWING BY GETTING THE BEST INTEREST RATES ON BONDS. LET ME TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT IS INCLUDED IN THE EIGHTY EIGHT PROGRAMS- IT BASICALLY FUNDS FLAGSHIP PROGRAM AT THE END RESOURCES BOARD AND THE NATIONAL TALK ABOUT BOTH OF THEM. SO I THINK EVERY SOURCES BOARD EIGHTY EIGHT FUNDS THREE PROGRAMS THAT FOCUS ON IMPROVING AIR QUALITY CLEANER VEHICLES. FIRST IS THE CARL MOYER PROGRAM IT PROVIDES ABOUT THIRTY MILLION OUT OF THE PROGRAM'S TOTAL BUDGET OF ABOUT A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. TO REDUCE EMISSIONS FROM DIESEL POWERED VEHICLES. THIS PROGRAM IS AN- BY ERROR DISTRICT AND SUPPORTS LOCAL EFFORTS TO IMPROVE AIR QUALITY. SECOND IS THE AIR QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM WHICH PROVIDES ABOUT THREE THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR PER VEHICLE PURCHASE INCENTIVES WITH A FOCUS ON CUTTING HARMFUL POLLUTION. AND LAST IS THE ENHANCED FLEET MODERNIZATION PROGRAM WHICH HELPS LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS RETIRE ENTRAPPED HIGHER POLLUTING VEHICLES AND GET ACCESS TO CLEANER ONES. AB EIGHT PROVIDES AIR B. AND THE BUREAU OF AUTOMATED AUTOMOTIVE REPAIR ABOUT THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY. THIRTY ENERGY COMMISSION EIGHTY EIGHT FUNDS FOR CLEAN TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM WHICH PROVIDES ABOUT A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR FOR GRANTS THAT HELP THE STATE. DIVERSIFIES TRANSPORTATION FUEL CHOICES BEYOND OIL. NOW I HAVE A LITTLE BIT DEEPER INTO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET PRIORITIES- THE APPOINT SENATE BEEN BILLED OUT IN OBSERVATION VEHICLE INFRASTRUCTURE. SO WHY INVEST IN VEHICLE INCENTIVES NOW. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR CLEAN CARTS FOR ALL WHICH ALLOWS LOWER INCOME FAMILIES TO SCRAP AN OLDER VEHICLE AND REPLACE IT WITH A ZERO OR NEAR ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE. THE BUDGET ALSO PROPOSES THREE HUNDRED FIFTEEN MILLION FOR CARDS ANY VEHICLE INCENTIVE PROJECT. WHICH PROVIDES GRANTS TO REPLACE YOU FOR THE A FULL. MISSION THE ACROSS. SO THESE GRANT PROGRAMS PROVIDE EARLY EMISSION REDUCTIONS BEFORE REGULATIONS ARE ESTABLISHED THAT MANDATE THE SWITCH TO ELECTRIC. THE PROGRAMS ARE ALSO CRITICAL CARE DISTRICTS WHICH ARE REALLY LIKE TURNING OVER EVERY ROCK TO MEET PAYMENT DEADLINES. WHY IS THAT THE INFRASTRUCTURE. SO WE NEED THEIR MISSION VEHICLE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S CONVENIENT AND UBIQUITOUS ACROSS THE STATE WE ALSO NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE HALF OF ALL CALIFORNIANS WHO BRENT FEEL COMFORTABLE BUYING AND THEIR MISSION VEHICLE BECAUSE THEY HAVE A CONVENIENT PLACE TO REFUEL IT. WITHOUT INVESTMENT NOW WE ARE NOT GOING TO NEED THE STATE'S TARGET FOR THEIR MISSION CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE FOR TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. THE CURRENT GOAL IS TO HAVE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND CHARGERS TO SUPPORT ONE POINT FIVE MILLION ELECTRIC VEHICLES WE ARE WELL ON OUR WAY TO BEATING THAT ONE POINT FIVE MILLION ELECTRIC VEHICLE TARGETS. WE LOOK AT DATA- PUBLIC DATA ON INVESTMENTS BY UTILITIES PRESIDENCIES- AND- OUR INVESTMENTS GOVERNMENT INVESTMENT. AND WE ESTIMATE WE'RE GOING TO BE ABOUT SIXTY THOUSAND CHARGERS SHORT OF THAT TARGET. WE'RE ALSO TWENTY ONE STATION SHORT OF THE STATE'S GOAL OF HAVING TWO HUNDRED HYDROGEN PUBLIC HYDROGEN STATIONS BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. AND WE'RE ALSO GOING TO NEED TO SIGNIFICANTLY RAMP UP OUR TO MEET OUR TARGETS FOR TWENTY THIRTY AND BEYOND- AB TWENTY ONE TWENTY SEVEN REQUIRES ARE AT MY AGENCY GUARANTEE COMMISSION CAN DO IT NOW SINCE THE TWENTY THIRTY CHARGING ME. EVERY PUBLISHED A DRAFT ANALYSIS THAT FOUND- THAT. BASED ON THEIR DEBATE OVER GONNA NEED ABOUT EIGHT BILLION THAT. AND TO SUPPORT THEM ONE THE ONE POINT FIVE MILLION CHARTER SO WE NEED TO GO FROM TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND CHARGERS IN TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. THE ONE POINT FIVE MILLION IN TWENTY THIRTY THAT. SAID THAT THE STEEP RAMP UP. I WANT ALSO EMPHASIZED THAT WHY WE'RE DOING IT. AND IT'S REALLY AROUND WHAT ARE IMPORTANT GOALS IMPROVING PUBLIC HEALTH. CUTTING CLIMATE POLLUTION. ADVANCING ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND JOB CREATION AND PROMOTING EQUITY. ON THE HEALTH SIDE. IF THE PRICE ALL OF YOU BUT TRANSPORTATION IS. A MAJOR SOURCE ARGUABLY OUR NUMBER ONE SOURCE OF HARMFUL AIR POLLUTION- IT'S SORT OF OVER 70% OF SMOG FORMING NOT AT 95% OF TOXIC DIESEL PARTICULATE MATTER. THIS IS REALLY- IMPACTING COMMUNITIES WHO LIVE NEAR THE COURT MARCH. ON THE CLIMATE SO- IT'S THE FOURTH ATTACK OF OUR GREENHOUSE WHEN YOU'RE CAN PERMISSION FROM THE FOR OF THE FUEL IT'S- AND UNLIKE THE REST WHICH BEEN CUT IN HALF OVER THE PAST DECADE. THE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS PRETENTIOUS YOU'RE ACTUALLY TRENDING UP. ON THE ON THE ECONOMY SIDE THERE'S A REAL OPPORTUNITY IN THE NEAR TERM TO BUILD OUT THAT INFRASTRUCTURE AND AT THE ECONOMIC STIMULUS THAT'S GOING TO HELP SUPPORT RECOVERY. EITHER SHOVEL READY PROJECT THEY'RE GONNA PUT CALIFORNIANS TO WORK BUILDING THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE NEED FOR THE FUTURE. AND IT'S ALSO A STIMULUS EVERY DOLLAR OF INVESTMENT LEADS TO ANOTHER DOLLAR THIRTY OF PRIVATE INVESTMENT. AND THIS INVESTMENT IS SENDING A SIGNAL THAT COMPANIES CAN BANK ON. ON THE EQUITY SIDE- WE ARE WE'VE DONE ANALYSIS OF. WHAT THE WHAT THE IMPLICATIONS ARE FOR CHARGER DISK DISTRIBUTION BASED ON SB ONE THOUSAND REQUIREMENTS. AND WE'RE FINDING THAT WHILE TARGET DISTRIBUTION BROADLY FOLLOWS EASY DEPLOYMENT WE NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB ENSURING BOROUGH NOT UNITY AND LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. HAVE ACCESS TO CONVENIENT CHARGING. WE ALSO NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE CALIFORNIA WHO LIVE IN MUMBAI DWELLINGS HAVE BEEN ACCESS TO CHARGING. SO TO SUMMARIZE THEIR MISSION VEHICLES ARE THE FUTURE. NOT TO THINK CALIFORNIA THE GLOBAL. THE INVESTMENTS THAT ARE PROPOSED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WILL HELP OVERCOME ONE OF THE BIGGEST BARRIERS TO WIDESPREAD COMMERCIALIZATION OF THEIR MISSION VEHICLES THE LACK OF INFRASTRUCTURE. I NOTHING NOW WILL PROVIDE MARKET CERTAINTY AND ENCOURAGE THE FICTIONAL INVESTMENT BY INDUSTRY HERE IN OUR HOME STATE. SUPPORTING GOOD JOBS. FOR MORE EQUITABLE ACCESS MAKE SURE EVERYONE. I'M JOINED BY COLLEAGUES FROM THE ENERGY COMMISSION RESEARCH REPORT AND IT'S PART OF FINANCE TO FIND YOUR QUESTIONS AND I LOOK FORWARD TO THE COMP. THANK YOU. THANK YOU COMMISSIONER. OF WE WILL- HAVE TO SAVE THE QUESTIONS FOR THE END AFTER ALL THE PANELISTS HAVE. HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK- NEXT. DO WE HAVE SOMEONE FROM THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD.

AND SO WE DIRECTOR ALLEGED REALLY CAN THESE PROPOSALS I PART OF THAT BROADER. CONTEXT YOUR SENSE OF AB EIGHT THESE WERE MAKES THEIR SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF. CHANGES BOTH IN KIND GOALS THAT THE STATE A STAB IN TERMS GREENHOUSE AND LOCAL AIR. REDUCTION THE GOVERNOR. NEW JOB GOAL THERE'S ALSO BEEN A LOT OF NEW POLICIES AND CHANGES IN REVENUE SOURCES AND SO WE DO THIS IS A GOOD OPPORTUNITY. TO EVALUATE THE STATE'S OVERALL STRATEGY IN THIS AREA- INCLUDING YOU KNOW WHAT POLICIES FUNDING SOURCES AND PROGRAM SHOULD BE ADOPTED TO ACHIEVE OUR SOMEBODY'S. TERM GOALS ARE KNOW FREE EXAMPLE THE- THE BEST MIX OF REGULATIONS INCENTIVES. WILD WEATHER THE CURRENT MIX OF PROGRAM ACHIEVING CLIMATE FOR ALL GOALS BECAUSE EFFECTIVE WHAT'S OUT ABOUT AND A MOMENT. AND IT DISTRIBUTES OF COSTS BENEFITS. SO AS YOU KIND OF THE- CONSIDERING THOSE. BIG PICTURE QUESTION. WE WANTED TO RAISE A FEW. FOR QUESTIONS OF THANK ABOUT- FIRST IS- WHAT'S THE BEST SOURCE OF FOR THE INCENTIVE FOR THE LEGISLATURE DOES WANT ADOPT WHAT'S THE BEST SOURCE OF. I'M YOU CAN SEE ON YOUR- ON TWELVE- THERE IS A- I'M NOT GOING TO GO THROUGH THAT TAPE AND BUT IT REALLY DOES. I TRIED TO SOME- THAT THE SENATE PROGRAMS THAT STATE HAS NOT. TRYING TO ENTER WERE IN MOBILE SOURCING. AND AREN'T YOU CAN NEARLY TWO POINT AND FUN FOR VARIETY OF THE PRO. AND IN PARTICULAR YOU CAN SEE THERE'S A SEVERAL DIFFERENT FUNDING TO THAT ARE USED FOR THE PROGRAM. INCLUDING AND TRADE BEEN A CAPITA REVENUE. A RATE FUNDED- MONEY TO COME WITH THE- LOW CARBON FUELS. AS WELL AS THE EIGHT- RELATED VEHICLE TO SO THINKING ABOUT KIND OF WHAT'S THE BUT BASS MIX OF FUNDING SOURCES THESE PRO. I DO THINK COMES TODAY EIGHT EXTENT PROPOSED THAT THE RELATED FEES ARE REASONABLE SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR SOME OF THESE PROGRAM- BECAUSE THERE IS A NEXUS BETWEEN THAT SORT OF. IN THAT ACTIVITIES THAT ARE BEING. ABOUT ARE OTHER OF WHAT CONTENTS. INCLUDING BUT THE REAL BURDEN ON THANK OF THE- OF THE YOUNG SORTS OF IMAGE OPERATING FIFTY. BETWEEN HEAVY DUTY AND LIGHT DUTY VEICLE- INDEX SOME OF THOSE DAYS TO INFLATION. AREN'T ANY STEP IN A LITTLE BIT MORE IT'S JUST DON'T MIX OF FUNDING THAT YOU- ONE EXAMPLE I THINK ANY WHEN I LIE AS THE USER I. O. U. WE HAVE WHICH COULD HAVE. IMPACTS ON BOTH ELECTRICITY CONSUMERS BUT ALSO HAS IMPLICATIONS ARE POTENTIALLY FOR THE STATE'S GREENHOUSE GAS AND ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS AS HI ELECTRICITY RATES CAN PRESENT A BARRIER TO. SWITCHING TO ELECTRIFICATION OF VEHICLES AND- I HAVE CLIENTS THAT SO JUST KIND OF THINKING ABOUT YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT WHAT IS THE BEST MIX OF FUNDING SOURCES FOR THESE PROGRAMS WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT. SECOND WHICH PROGRAM SHOULD BE FUNDED ONCE YOU'VE IDENTIFIED WHICH- FUNDING SOURCE YOU'D LIKE TO USE. IDEALLY THIS DECISION WOULD BE INFORMED BY- GOOD INFORMATION ESTIMATES ABOUT THE COST EFFECTIVENESS OF THE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS THAT REDUCE MOBILE SOURCE EMISSIONS- UNFORTUNATELY THERE'S- AT THIS POINT- SOME OF THAT INFORMATION IS A LITTLE BIT LACKING WE HAVE GOTTEN. SOME INFORMATION FROM THE ADMINISTRATION THAT TRIES TO ESTIMATE THE COST EFFECTIVENESS OF DIFFERENT PROGRAMS IN THIS AREA- I THINK THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE IS REALLY TRYING TO KIND OF PUT THAT INFORMATION TOGETHER IN A WAY THAT. ALLOWS THE LEGISLATURE TO KIND OF COMPARE ACROSS PROGRAMS- IT HASN'T REALLY BEEN PRESENTED. TO US IN THAT WAY YET AND SO WE'RE WE'RE CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION TO TRY TO. GATHER AND ORGANIZE INFORMATION THAT HELPS- ENOUGH INFORM YOUR DECISIONS ABOUT WHICH PROGRAMS ARE LIKELY TO ACHIEVE A SIMILAR A QUALITY CLIMATE GOALS MOST COST EFFECTIVELY- IN THE ABSENCE OF SOME OF THAT INFORMATION SOME OF THE KEY CONSIDERATIONS WE THANK OUR- WHEN THINKING ABOUT WHERE TO ALLOCATE YOUR FUNDING ARE. A LIGHT DUTY VERSUS HEAVY DUTY- AND CUT YOU KNOW HOW TO PRIORITIZE THOSE. OUT ONE I THINK YOU DESERVE INFORMATION LIKE IT'D BE A COAST- IN THE MOBILE SOURCE WORLD TEND TO BE A LARGER SOURCE OF- GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS WERE AS HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES. ARE A LARGER SOURCE OF LOCAL AIR POLLUTANTS AND SO SOME OF YOUR DECISIONS AROUND PRIORITIZATION. MIGHT DEPEND ON KIND OF HOW YOU PRIORITIZE CLIMATE VERSUS AIR QUALITY GOALS IN PART. ON ANOTHER ISSUE IS JUST KIND OF HOW YOU- BALANCE OF TRADE OFF BETWEEN NEAR TERM AND LONG TERM- INITIAL REDUCTIONS- YOU KNOW- TO POINT AND KIND OF EXISTING COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGIES. IS LIKELY TO REDUCE EMISSIONS MORE COST EFFECTIVELY IN THE NEAR TERM BUT- I FUNDING PILOTS AND DEMONSTRATIONS CAN CAN RELATE FOR HERE YOUR LONG TERM BENEFITS THAT YOU'RE PROMOTING TECHNOLOGIES THAT THAT CAN BE USED. TO ACHIEVE SOME OF THEIR- MORE LONG TERM GOALS. AND THEN I CAN THAT THE ONE OTHER ISSUE THAT IS FOR. RELEVANT TO THIS PROPOSAL AND THEY GOT PART. IS HOW MUCH OF. ON IF THE GOAL IS- ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE AND FROM ZERO VEHICLES HOW MUCH TO FOCUS ON INCREASE. VERSUS VEHICLE INCENTIVE AND SO. BASED ON OUR REVIEW OF THE LETTER WE GET THERE IS- IF THAT'S THE GOAL THAT THERE'S AN ARGUMENT FOR BOTH OF THOSE PIECES. OF SUPPORT FOR BOTH INFRASTRUCTURE AND- VEHICLE REBATES. ARE WE DO THINK THAT THERE'S A STRONG ARGUMENT THAT THERE'S LIMITED FUNDING TO- GET SOME PRIORITIZATION FOR. INFRASTRUCTURE THERE'S SOME RESEARCH THAT SUGGESTS YOU KNOW IT'S AN ADDITIONAL DOLLAR FOR INFRASTRUCTURE- COULD HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE BENEFIT THAN- FOR VEHICLE REBATES HOWEVER. THAT SAME RESEARCH ALSO SAYS THAT BOTH ARE IMPORTANT AND THERE'S THERE ARE COMPLEMENTARY IN SOME WAYS AND SO TRYING TO FIND THAT RIGHT BALANCE IT WILL BE. ONE OF THE KEY ISSUES AND CHALLENGES. FOR THE LEGISLATURE. FINALLY OUT TRYING TO WRAP UP MY- COMMENTS HERE I DO JUST WANT TO MAKE A- VERY. MEANT OF WE HAD SOME COMMENTS RECOMMENDATIONS AROUND JUST PROPOSAL TO. ACCELERATE SOME OF THE CONTRACTS PROTECTION FUNDING THROUGH THE ISSUE OF- REVENUE BONDS AT THE ENERGY COMMISSION- JUST PICNIC SHE HAD A BASIC- CONSIDERATION AND TRADE OFF HERE IS WHETHER THAT. NEAR TERM INCREASING FUNDING THAT YOU WOULD GET CONNECTION IN THE BOND IT'S WORTH- WHICH WOULD BE UP TO A BILLION DOLLARS TO SUPPORT THE- THE REDUCTION IN FUNDING IN AND OUT YEARS AS MOST OF THE COIN TRANSPORTATION MONEY WOULD BE GOING TO. PAY OFF DEBT SERVICE FROM THOSE BONDS AND SO- YOU MIGHT WANT TO EXPLORE WHAT THAT THE ADMINISTRATION SORT WHAT THEIR EXPECTATIONS ARE ABOUT LONG TERM FUNDING NEEDS AND HOW THOSE MEN NEED TO BE IN THAT. IF THIS PROPOSAL WERE TO BE TO BE ADOPTED. AND THE FINAL ISSUE- WHICH IS MAYBE A LITTLE BIT MORE TECHNICAL BUT WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FROM A LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT PERSPECTIVE IS THAT IS THE LEVEL OF. AUTHORITY PROVIDED TO THE ADMINISTRATION- IN PARTICULAR THE- ONE IT SHOWS THE- LEVEL OF CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATION AUTHORITY FOR. THE CLEAN TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM WE DO THINK IT'S REASONABLE TO PROVIDE CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATION AUTHORITY FOR THE- THE PIECE OF FUNDING THAT'S NEEDED TO PAY THE DEBT SERVICE ON THE BONDS AT THAT PROPOSAL IS ADOPTED. HOWEVER WE DON'T. THINK THAT NECESSARILY ALL OF THE CONTRACTS PROTECTION FUNDING WOULD NEED TO BE CONTINUOUSLY APPROPRIATED IN ORDER TO DO THAT- YEP AND PROVIDING SOME OF THAT CONTINUOUS. APPROPRIATION AUTHORITY WOULD HELP REDUCE THE BORROWING COSTS BUT WE DON'T THINK ALL THAT NEEDS TO. TO BE CONTINUOUSLY APPROPRIATED. AND CIRCLING AND LIMITING THAT TO WHATEVER IS NEEDED WHAT HEALTH INSURER I'M GOING LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT OVER THE REST OF THE MONEY THAT ISN'T. NEEDED TO PAY OUT THE DEBT SERVICE ON THE BONDS. SO HAPPY TO EXPLORE THAT ISSUE WITH WITH YOU IN YOUR STOP AND ANSWER QUESTIONS GOING FORWARD- I WILL IN MY COMMENTS THERE AND OF COURSE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY. ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT. THANK YOU MISTER BROWN. OF DO WE HAVE ANYONE FROM. OF FINANCE. THAT ONE TO ADD. ME COMMENTS. PUBLIC WE DON'T WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING ADD AT THIS BUT- HERE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS YEAH. OKAY THANK YOU. OF SEE I'M DO ANY MEMBERS HAVE COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS MISS FRIEDMAN. THANK YOU A FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO. REALLY REALLY THANK GOVERNOR NEWSMAN THE MINISTRATION FOR THIS EXTREMELY BOLD ACTION THAT THEY'RE TAKING TO. SERIOUSLY INVEST IN A CLEAN CAR FUTURE- IT IS. IT IS OF A VISIONARY APPROACH AND ONE THAT IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO KNOW A LOT OF THE- CLEAN ENERGY AND SORT OF A- ENVIRONMENTAL ACTIVISTS FOCUS A LOT ON OIL PRODUCTION- HERE AND AROUND THE WORLD BUT- YOU KNOW I WOULD CONTEND THAT UNLESS WE- PUT SERIOUS EFFORT INTO REDUCING THE DEMAND. FOR FOSSIL FUELS- THOSE EFFORTS ARE ARE GOING TO FALL FLAT IF WE CONTINUE TO PURCHASE AND USE A GASOLINE POWERED AUTOMOBILE SO THIS IS A HUGE HUGE. A STEP AND SOMETHING THAT WILL REVERBERATE THROUGH THE ENTIRE COUNTRY IF NOT THE WORLD I WE KNOW THAT THAT ELECTRIC VEHICLES IN A ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES ARE OUR FUTURE AND THE CALIFORNIA IS REALLY. I THINK A OF TAKING THE LEAD IN A WORLDWIDE ON ON THIS AND SO I'M REALLY PROUD TO SEE THIS HAPPEN IN MY STATE AND BE PART OF THE CONVERSATION. I WOULD BE REMISS HOWEVER IF I DIDN'T TAKE JUST A MINUTE TO PUT A PLUG IN WELL I HAVE THE ADMINISTRATION- HOPEFULLY ON THE ON THE PHONE HERE AT LEAST ONE OF THEM TO REMIND EVERYONE THAT WHILE INVESTMENT IN CLEAN VEHICLES IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT AND I'M THRILLED TO SEE THE STAFF WE ALSO CAN'T REMEMBER THAT GETTING PEOPLE. OUT OF SINGLE OCCUPANCY AUTOMOBILES ALSO HAS TO BE A PRIORITY BECAUSE IT'S NOT SUSTAINABLE TO FORCE EVERYBODY IN OUR COMMUNITY ALWAYS TO DRIVE EVERYWHERE IT HAS A HUGE IMPACT ON OUR ABILITY TO USE LAND SYSTEMICALLY ON OUR ABILITY TO BUILD HOUSING. ON TRAFFIC CONGESTION QUALITY OF LIFE PUBLIC HEALTH AND EVERYTHING ELSE IN WALLS OF YOUR IMPORTANT THEY DON'T ADDRESS ANY OF THOSE ISSUES SO AT THE SAME TIME THAT WE INVEST IN CLEAN CARS WE ALSO CAN'T STOP INVESTING AND WE NEED TO. INCREASE ARE INVESTING IN WELL AS WELL IN MASS TRANSIT AND PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION AN ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION SO I. JUST WANT TO PUT THAT OUT THERE THAT WE SHOULD BE DOING. HOPE TO SEE IN THE FUTURE EQUAL. OF INVESTMENTS AND COMMITMENTS. TO THOSE SORTS OF MODALITIES AND I WOULD SAY FOR OUR LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. THE BEST WAY THAT WE CAN. SUPPORT THEM IS BY GIVING THEM THOSE KINDS OF MOBILITY OPTIONS. BECAUSE WHETHER IT'S AS EVER GASOLINE POWERED VEHICLE IT'S VERY EXPENSIVE TO MAINTAIN AN AUTOMOBILE CALIFORNIA TO PAY THE INSURANCE AND EVERYTHING ELSE- AND FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE. FORCED TO COMMUTE LONG DISTANCES THE TIME THAT IT TAKES TO DO THAT COMMUTE IS ALSO A HUGE IMPACT ON PEOPLE'S QUALITY OF LIFE SO- INVESTING IN. DIFFERENT MOBILITY OPTIONS THAT ARE. INEXPENSIVE AND CONVENIENT MORE CONVENIENT FOR PEOPLE SHOULD ALSO BE A HUGE GOAL. I WITHOUT SAID I DO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS I'M NOT REALLY SURE WHO THEY'RE FOR SO I'LL JUST ASK THEM AND WHOEVER WANTS TO TRY TO ANSWER FINE. A FIRST UP WITH REGARD AND I APOLOGIZE IF THESE WERE ANSWERED SOMEWHERE IN THIS VERY LONG AMOUNT OF INFORMATION THAT WAS JUST GIVEN TO US- BUT IN REGARDS TO THE CLEAN TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM THE ADMINISTRATION'S OUTLINED ITS PLAN TO SPEND THE FIRST FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. AT THE PROPOSED FUND OF ONE BILLION IN SECURITIZED REVENUE ONE ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS WHAT IS THE PLAN TO SPEND THE ADDITIONAL FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AND WHAT KIND OF INVESTMENTS DOES THE ADMINISTRATION WANT TO PRIORITIZE. THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION- WELL AND I WOULD BE HELPFUL TO MAP OUT HOW WE'RE THINKING ABOUT BOTH. THE FULL BILLION DOLLARS IN INVESTMENT SO. THE FIRST FIVE HUNDRED MILLION WE'RE REALLY FOCUSED IN ON THE NEAR TERM THE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE YEAH. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE ENOUGH INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT AT LEAST ONE POINT FIVE MILLION. I SHOULD BE ABLE BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE WE I MEAN I. EVERY PERSON FORGET TALK MORE ABOUT THIS BUT I THINK YOU KNOW THERE'S A POSSIBILITY THAT WE'RE GOING TO EXCEED THAT TARGET WILL NEED. MORE OF THAT INFRASTRUCTURE- BUT WHAT WE ARE NOW FOR THE- AB TWENTY ONE SEVEN THAT ANALYZE WHAT THE MANTRA NEEDS TO MEET TWENTY FIVE AND TWENTY THIRTY. GOALS AND WHAT WE'RE FINDING IS THAT THERE'S A GAP SO WE NEED ABOUT SIXTY THOUSAND ADDITIONAL CHARGERS. AT ABOUT TWENTY ONE ADDITIONAL HYDROGEN STATIONS TO MEET OUR GOALS FOR TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. AND WE ARE PLAN IS TO SPEND THAT FOR FIVE HUNDRED MILLION FILLING THAT GAP. SO BIG FOCUS ON- THREE MILLION ON LIGHT DUTY VEHICLE CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE AND THEN TWO HUNDRED MILLION TO SKI MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY STATE. THAT'S A PLACE WHERE- EITHER THE AIR QUALITY IMPACTS ARE SO PROFOUND. IN A COMMUNITIES BY GOODMAN MOVEMENT CORRIDORS THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE PRIORITIZING. THOSE INVESTMENTS AS WELL. IF WE NEED A SECOND FIVE MILLION FAR THINKING IS THAT WOULD REALLY FOR. IN ON- RAMPING UP TOWARDS OUR TWENTY THIRTY TARGET. AND OUR BOARD REALLY TO. THE MARKET. WE WANT TO THE STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS ON THE PUBLIC DOLLARS SITES. THAT LEAD TO A BIG INFLUX OF PRIVATE SECTOR. INVESTMENTS SO OUR GOAL IS OVER TIME TO REDUCE THE PUBLIC SHARE OF HER CHARGER. INVESTMENTS AND GET TO A POINT WHERE THE MARKET IS SELF SUSTAINING. THANK YOU JUST TO DRILL DOWN INTO THAT FOR A SECOND SO THE THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR LIGHT DUTY INFRASTRUCTURE- TO MEET THAT GOAL OF THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND CHARGERS. I'M WONDERING IF YOU HAVE A BREAKDOWN OF EXACTLY HOW MUCH FUNDING YOU NEED TO CLOSE THAT GAP. WELL OUR ASSESSMENT IS THAT WE CAN CLOSE THE GAP WITH THAT. THREE HUNDRED MILLION. OKAY GREAT- THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL HAS FOUR HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE MILLION FROM THE G. G. R. AFTER ERA BEES. LOW CARBON TRANSPORTATION PROGRAMS AND UP TO A BILLION FROM THE CDC'S CLEAN TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM FOR THE INFRASTRUCTURE. I'M WONDERING HOW YOU. MAXIMIZE THOSE PROGRAMS SO THEY WORK TOGETHER WELL. THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION ONCE I START AND- THE FOLKS IN EVERY FOR SUPPORT THEY WANT AND SALAS THE PREVIOUS STEP AND- SO WE ARE- WE'RE THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT THESE AS- COMPLEMENTARY AND WHERE WE CAN WE ARE PARTNERING DIRECTLY. SO THAT FROM THE VIEWPOINT OF THE GRANT GEE THEY DON'T ACTUALLY IT'S- THEY DON'T SEE THAT THERE'S TO BE CONFUSED I THINK- I'M JUST APPLYING FOR A GRANT THAT WE GIVE ME MY TRUCK AND WOULD GIVE ME MY INFRASTRUCTURE- SO WE'RE WE'RE- INTENTIONALLY PARTNERING. ON SPECIFIC- GRAHAM PROGRAMS. AND THEN THERE ARE SOME PLANS WERE JUST OTHER MAKE SENSE PARTNER WHERE WE WILL HAVE INDIVIDUAL INVESTMENTS HAPPENING YOU KNOW JUST ON THE OTHER SIDE ARE TO FUNNY. SIDE BUT OUR GOAL IS TO MAKE THIS AS SEAMLESS AS POSSIBLE. FOR THE GRANT SHE COMMUNITY TO NOT FEEL LIKE- THIS IS A CDC GRANT ALL THE DIFFERENT REQUIREMENTS AS AN AIR BE GRANT WITH ALL THESE DIFFERENT REQUIREMENTS WE REALLY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS. LIKE AS EASY AS POSSIBLE. BOB FOR. FOR FOLKS TO GET GRANTS ON. BOTH THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE VEHICLE SIDE. GREAT THAT'S GOOD TO KNOW THAT- THAT YOU'VE ALREADY THOUGHT ABOUT THIS IN THAT YOU'RE- KIND OF BLENDING THIS TOGETHER FOR THE END USER SO THAT IS MORE SEAMLESS. I JUST A FEW MORE QUESTIONS. SOME PEOPLE COULD ARGUE THAT THE SMOG ABATEMENT FEE IN THE VEHICLE REGISTRATION FEES ARE REGRESSIVE FEES. AND I'M WONDERING HOW WE CAN ENSURE THAT THE BENEFIT OF THE FEES CAN BE SPENT TO BENEFIT LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS- YOU KNOW WITH HAVING A CONTINUOUSLY APPROPRIATED PROGRAMS FROM CAP AND TRADE. LIMITS OUR ABILITY IN THE LEGISLATURE TO REALLY DO OVERSIGHT AND TO REFORM ANY OF THE PROGRAMS. AND I'M WONDERING- HOW. WE CAN. STILL HAVE THAT OVERSIGHT AND STILL. YOU KNOW ENSURE THAT THE PROGRAMS ARE EFFICIENT THAT THEY'RE EXACTLY WHAT WE WANT TO BE WITHOUT THEM BEING CONTINUOUSLY APPROPRIATED IF THERE'S A WAY THAT WE CAN. KIND OF MAKE THAT HAPPEN STILL. WELL THE CAN APPROPRIATIONS SO WE CAN FRONT LOAD- INVESTMENT IN THEIR MISSION CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE- SO I YOU KNOW THAT'S- IT JUST IMPORTANT FOR US TO BE ABLE TO. SHOW THE WORLD THAT WE ARE COMMITTED AND THAT WE ARE. OVERCOMING WHAT I WOULD ARGUE IS THE BIGGEST BARRIER TO THE COMMERCIALIZATION INTERMISSION VEHICLES- AND- BUT THERE ARE OVERSIGHT TOOL TO MAYBE I COULD SPEND JUST A FEW MINUTES. TALKING ABOUT WHAT CURRENTLY EXISTS IN STATUTE- THE CLINTON PROTECTION PROGRAM YOU KNOW HOW TO PRETTY SPECIFIC. REQUIREMENTS IN STATUTE ALREADY EIGHT EIGHTY EIGHT. AND ONE OF THEM IS WE HAVE AN ADVISORY COMMITTEE THAT'S VERY DIVERSE WE PUBLISH ANNUAL INVESTMENT PLANS AND WE GIVE THEM TO THE LEGISLATURE IT AND- ABBOTT UP TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH LEGISLATURE ABOUT THOSE. PRIORITIES ALSO- SEVERAL PIECE OF LEGISLATION AND REFER TO THEM AB TWENTY ONE TWENTY SEVEN. REQUIRES US TO DO AN ASSESSMENT A CHARGER. NEEDS FOR US THREE TWENTY THIRTY AND RECTIFYING BEYOND TWENTY THIRTY- AND THAT'S THAT'S NUMBER TO THE EVERY TWO YEARS. TO SET US UP ARE WE ON TRACK. WHAT MISSING. AND GIVE US A NOT TO FINE TUNE OUR- AND MAYBE. YOU KNOW THEM AT AT WE FIND MARKETS ARE TO EXCEL. OF THE PRIVATE MARKET TO TAKE OVER- THERE'S ALSO AT THE THOUSAND WHICH REQUIRES US TO LOOK AT EQUITY DISTRIBUTION CHARTER AND WE'RE USING THAT THAT'S- OUR- THE WERE WERE YOU. SOME OF THE- OVERSIGHT THAT BUDGET. HAS REQUIRED US TO DO. TO BE OF TO REFER. AND RETOOL. AND IMPROVE OUR OUR INVESTMENTS DO YOU THINK THAT THAT IS ENOUGH- OVERSIGHT TO. MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE BEING RESPONSIVE TO EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES. SO AS THE CHARGING NEEDS CHANGE AS THE VEHICLES CHANGE WILL THAT GIVE THE ALLOW US TO BE NIMBLE ENOUGH. TO ADJUST IF YOU KNOW KIND OF THE BETAMAX OF THE CHARGING YOU KNOW MOVES OVER ATTACK. THE TAPE DECK OF THE CHARGING OR- THE CD ROM OF THE CHARGING. US SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO IT WE DON'T END UP WITH OBSOLETE. INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE PAID FOR. TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. REPORTER NEEDS TWENTY. KIDS YEAH UP AT SCHOOL ABILITY- YOU KNOW WE ARE READ OUT TO INDUSTRY WERE REALLY TRYING TO MAKE SURE AND INDUSTRY ONCE AGAIN NOBODY WANTS TRANSIT INVESTMENTS HERE THIS IS BAD FOR EVERYBODY- WE'RE NOT FUNDING THE FULL COST OF THE CHARGES TODAY. AND WE PLAN TO FIND LESS AND LESS OVER TIME. TO THE PRIVATE INDUSTRY HAS A STAKE IN MAKING SURE THAT WE GET THIS RIGHT. WE WILL. DEFINITELY YOU KNOW AND YOU'RE RIGHT THIS IS A VERY DYNAMIC TIME AND YOU DON'T LOOK BACK FIVE YEARS YOU THINK OH MY GOSH I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW MUCH HAS CHANGED IN JUST FIVE YEARS. AT SOMEBODY'S IN THE TRANSPORTATION SPACE FOR. TWENTY FIVE MY GOSH. TWENTY FOUR HERE I GOTTA SAY I. FEEL LIKE I'VE NEVER BEEN YOU KNOW. SO EXCITED BY THE POSSIBILITY OF THEIR MISSION VEHICLE TRANSPORTATION. AND NOW OUR BIG HURDLE YOU KNOW WE'RE SEEING THE VEHICLE. PRICES ARE COMING DOWN THERE'S A LOT OF EVIDENCE THAT IN THE NEXT TWO TO FIVE YEARS EV'S WILL BE CHEAPER BUT HIGH. NOT JUST OPERATE EARLY CHEAPER OPERATE YOU COULD SAVE YOU KNOW ELEVEN HUNDRED SEVENTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS PER YEAR. ON REDUCED- FUEL AND MAINTENANCE COSTS BUT- CHEAPER TO BUY SO NOW THE BIG- INSTRUCTIONS IT IS A DYNAMIC ENVIRONMENT I DO BELIEVE THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY SEVEN ANALYSIS- GETS A- GREAT A GREAT TOOL TO BE ABLE TO TRACK PROGRESS THE NATURE OF WORK TAYLOR I'M BASS THAT'S- WHAT THE MARKET. I THINK YOUR POINT ABOUT PARTNERING WITH PRIVATE INDUSTRY AND LETTING THEM HELP TO DRIVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE DECISIONS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT ONE BECAUSE THEY WILL BE INVESTING IN. THERE THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE A BETTER IDEA OF WHAT'S NEXT. THEN WE WILL CERTAINLY- ARE WE GONNA GET EIGHT- DRAFT OF HOW THE SECURITIZED FUNDS ARE GONNA BE USED FOR THE NEXT THREE YEARS. IS THAT SOMETHING THAT WE WILL BE PROVIDED. OKAY BACK. SIX ARE YOU THINK ABOUT HOW MAYBE DO AT THE PART ABOUT YOU HAVE A SENSE OF I AM. I MEAN I CAN FIND ARE YOU THINKING WHAT OF DETAIL TERMS OF THE- USE OF THE FUNDS OF YOU KNOW NOT GRAN BUT I THINK BE GOOD TO AN UNDER. YOU KNOW KIND OF WHAT PLANNING ON DOING OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS I'M JUST THAT OUT THERE THAT THAT WOULD BE. THAT BE OF INTEREST TO ME I INTO. TO MAYBE TO THIS COMMITTEE THANK YOU AND THEN LASTLY I'M- WE'LL START GOING. OF OUR TOPIC THAT. OKAY GO BACK TO THE GOVERNOR. IN JUST. EIGHT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GIVE YOU THE INFORMATION THAT YOU NEED. AND THEN LASTLY I'M JUST CIRCLE BACK TO WHAT I SAID IN THE BEGINNING. WHICH IS THAT I DO THINK THAT WE SHOULD CENTER. THEIR ABILITY TO REDUCE VMT THAT YOU KNOW THIS ALL IT I DON'T WANT TO UNDERESTIMATE HOW IMPORTANT. INVESTMENT IN THOSE ABS IS AND IT'S HUGELY IMPORTANT AGAIN I AM. YOU KNOW I COMPLEMENT THE GOVERNOR IN IN BEING A VISIONARY IN THIS AND REALLY PUTTING. OUR MONEY BEHIND THOSE GOALS I THINK THAT THAT'S A HUGE. HUGE STEP THAT I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER ABOUT. AND AT THE SAME TIME WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO REDUCE VMT BECAUSE THE- IMPACT. OF THESE LIGHT DUTY VEHICLES- EVEN IF THERE'S ABS IS STILL HUGE AND UNACCEPTABLE AND A HUGE BURDEN ON OUR COMMUNITIES- AND- DINNER AND- INTERPRETING SAYS SO MANY. OF OUR IMPORTANT GOALS BUILDING HOUSING REDUCING CONGESTION INCREASING HEALTH QUALITY OF LIFE. ROAD SAFETY- SO. I HOPE THAT YOU TAKE BACK. TO THE GOVERNOR. YOU KNOW THAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO WE NEED TO UP OUR INVESTMENTS IN TRANSIT. WE NEED TO UP OUR INVESTMENTS IN. ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION- WE NEED TO DO WHATEVER WE CAN TO DO NOT FORGET THAT. BE IT THAT REDUCING B. M. T. IS. STILL GOT TO BE OUR OVERRIDING GOAL SO. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT TO COMMENT ON THAT AT ALL. OR JUST TAKE THAT BACK BUT I WOULD LOVE TO MAYBE IF YOU CAN COMMENTED HOW. THAT FITS IN WITH THOSE THAT PROGRAM. ALL THE- FOLKS FROM THE AREA FIRST OF. TO COME ON THAT. MY THEIR- THEIR AREA. JERRY I THINK IT'S MUCH SO MY NAME TO NEVER ON THE OF THE MALL SOURCE. AT THE RESOURCE BOARD- SO APPS. EVERYTHING YOU'RE SAYING WITH RESPECT TO BE IN RHETORIC IN ABILITY SOME POINT FOR COMMUNITIES- I WILL FLAG AND I'M SURE YOU'RE AWARE OF SB THREE SEVENTY FIVE WHICH CARP HELPS OVERSEE TO HELP BRING CLOSER THAT CONNECTION BETWEEN TRANSPORTATION PLANNING AND HOUSING. THAT'S DONE AT THE MPO LEVEL BUT THERE'S ALSO SOME PIECES OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET THAT I THINK IT MIGHT BE PARTICULARLY INTERESTED AND JUST KIND OF CARING HEARING WHERE YOU'RE INTERESTED READERS ARE. SO WITH RESPECT TO THE EQUITY PROGRAM CUTS THAT ARE PROPOSED TO BE FOUNDED ON UNDER THE EQUITY THAN- AND THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET- I WILL FLAG THAT AND THAT EQUITY BEEN DOES INCLUDE THINGS LIKE- CAR SCRAP REPLACE PROGRAMS BUT ALSO INCLUDES OTHER EQUITY PROJECTS LIKE CAR SHARING ANOTHER MOBILITY OPTIONS TO HELP DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. GET ACCESS TO ZERO EMISSION MOBILITY NOT NECESSARILY IN THE FORM OF AN INDIVIDUALLY OWNED VEHICLE BUT IN OTHER FORMS AS WELL ALSO ADD THAT OUR HEAVY DUTY PROGRAMS ALSO PROVIDE FUNDING FOR ZERO EMISSION TRANSIT BUSES- AND SO THAT WOULD BE HOUSED. UNDER THAT HEAVY DUTY. THANKS I THINK THAT WHAT WE HAPP OVER TE LAST FEW YEARS WITH. THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR EMISSIONS AND KEEP CONTINUING TO INCREASE. SHOWS THAT THERE ARE WEAKNESSES IN SB THREE SEVENTY FIVE THAT WE HAVE TO ADDRESS SOMETHING THAT I'M WORKING ON A NEW OTHERS ARE AS WELL. AND WE NEED TO REALLY FOCUS ON A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN FOR MASS TRANSIT. FOR LOOKING AT NOT JUST HOUSING OR TRANSPORTATION BUT- FINDING WAYS TO GET GIVE PEOPLE EVERYTHING THEY NEED TO LIVE WITHIN WALKABLE AND BIKEABLE DISTANCE REALLY. THINKING AGAIN ABOUT HOW WE MOVE AROUND OUR COMMUNITIES. AND WE NEED TO PUT THE FUNDING BEHIND THOSE GOALS. DESERVE BUT WORK IS CRUCIALLY IMPORTANT M. AS A LOT OF OTHER WORK TO DO BECAUSE WHAT THE PATH RIGHT NOW IS NOT SUSTAINABLE EVEN IF EVERY CARD TOMORROW TURNED HIS ABS. IT'S STILL NOT A SUSTAINABLE- PATH SO I'LL DO I'LL JUST LEAVE IT AT THAT AND THANKS AGAIN FOR YOUR WORK AND- THANKS FOR ANSWERING ALL MY QUESTIONS. I THANK YOU MS RIVAS FOR FILLING IN FOR ME WE HAVE- MISTER SMITH FOLLOWED BY A MISTER BENNETT AND THEN THE THREE OF US IN THE QUEUE. THANK YOU MIGHT ONE OF MY BIGGEST CONCERNS IS ONE OF THE EXTENSION OF THE TAX THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE SUNSET IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE. AND EXTENDING IT TO TWENTY TWENTY FOUR OR TWENTY FORTY SIX. BUT MY CONCERN IS IN A RURAL COMMUNITY THAT I REPRESENT. WE MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO HAVE A CHARGING STATION ON EVERY CORNER HOW LONG IT TAKES TO CHARGE. SO HOW ARE THEY GOING TO BE DISTRIBUTED THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WOULD BE ONE OF MY FIRST QUESTIONS. THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION AND- I REFERENCE OF STUDY THAT WE HAD DONE SB ONE THOUSAND THAT LOOK AT THE EQUITY IMPLICATIONS OF OUR CHARGER DISTRIBUTION AS YOU KNOW WE DID FIND THAT WE NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB. IN RURAL AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND GETTING MORE CHARGER ACCESS- I REFER TO MY IN MY OPENING PRESENTATION TO THE FORD F. ONE FIFTY THAT'S GOING TO BE COMING OUT IN THE LECTURE VERSION AND- THIS IS WHERE YOU KNOW AT. AT LEAST MORE WE SEE MORE DIVERSE THAT THE VEHICLES IN THE ELECTRIC. SPACE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE OKAY. CAN GET ACCESS TO THOSE VEHICLES AND CAN AND CAN. CONVENIENTLY REVEALED. SO I THINK GOING FORWARD IT'S GOING TO BE. EVER MORE IMPORTANT THAT IN- OF WORLD COMMUNITIES. IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY THAT WE MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS INFRASTRUCTURE THAT SUIT THE NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY. DO YOU HAVE A MAP OF CALIFORNIA WHERE THEIR SUGGESTION TO GO AND CURRENTLY. THAT I COULD GET. YES WE CAN SHARE THE SB ONE THOUSAND REPORT WITH YOU WHICH HAS STAYED ON THE GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION. AND WHAT IS THE ERROR MESSAGE THAT A MESSAGE LEFT ESTIMATED AMOUNT OF FUNDING NEEDED TO ACHIEVE THE GOVERNOR'S ZERO ELECTRIC VEHICLE GOALS. HAPPY TO THIRD- RESPOND ALTHOUGH I THINK THE CARBON OF FINANCE MAY BE BETTER SUITED. BUT I THINK ANYBODY CAN DEPARTMENT FINAL STRIKE THE FOR. YOU KNOW I THINK THIS MARTIN ROGAN FROM FINANCE- THE- YEAH I THINK THAT THE COMMISSIONERS RT TALKED ABOUT BOTH THE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE GOALS IN THE TWENTY THIRTY GOALS. AND THAT THAT- WHAT WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING IS TO- BY EXTENDING THE REVENUES AND- BODY AGAINST THEM- THREE BILLION DOLLARS TOWARDS THOSE GOALS- WHICH IS- A MINUTE I THANK GOD. THE APPROACH THAT THE COMMISSIONER AND ENERGY COMMISSION CAN AND COULD TALK A LITTLE MORE ABOUT HOW THEY GET THERE BUT I THINK WE'VE ALREADY TALKED THROUGH ABOUT HOW THIS GETSAS MOST OF THE WAY THERE BUT- BUT THIS IS- THIS IS THIS IS PART OF THE WAY IN THE OTHER. THE OTHER ASPECT OF THIS IS THE PARTNERING WITH INDUSTRY AND THEN PARTNERING WITH THE PRIVATE SECTOR- TO ALSO PROVIDE THE FUNDING THAT HELPS US MAKE MEET THOSE TARGETS FOR WE'RE NOT SURE WHAT THE FUNDING. IS GOING TO BE IN THE FUTURE AND HOW MUCH IS GOING TO COST THE TAXPAYERS A CALIFORNIA. WHAT WE KNOW THE WORK THAT. MISSION EXTEND QUESTION. WE KNOW THE WORK OUR PROPOSAL IS TO- TO PROVIDE A THIRTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IN BONDS- AND I. TAKE THE ESTIMATE- THE ESTIMATED COST OF THAT IS AROUND THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS- OVER THE LIFE OF THE BONDS. HAVE ANOTHER FOLLOW UP QUESTION IN REGARD TO THE BONDS. IF THE DISTRICT SECURITISATION PIECE OF THIS PROPOSAL IS FOR ONE BILLION IN BONDS. OVER THIRTY YEARS WHAT'S THE DEBT SERVICE GOING TO BE ON THOSE BONDS. THAT WOULD BE THE THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION. AND THAT THAT THAT THE STUDENTS- ASSUMES THAT WE GET THE CONTINUES PREPARATION TO MAKE SURE WE PAY THATBECAUSE THAT- THE THREE FIFTY MILLION IS ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN- RESEARCH CERTAIN MEASUREMENT OF RISK IN THE BOND INDUSTRY. AND- SHOWS THAT- COULD USE PREPARATION HELPS BRING THAT AMOUNT DOWN TO THE THREE FIFTY LEVEL. THREE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION FOR OF THIRTY YEARS OF A ONE BILLION DOLLAR BOND IS. YES CORRECT. THAT'S ALL. THANK YOU MISTER BENNETT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF. CHERVIL MY OVERALL QUESTIONS DEAL WITH OVERSIGHT THAT THIS IS A THE MASSIVE PROGRAM AND THE THERE ARE MANY ASPECTS AND GIVEN THE AMOUNT OF TIME WE HAVE HERE DURING THIS HEARING I A- WE'LL JUST FOCUS ON THIS ONE ASPECT OF IT OVERALL- HAS- ASSEMBLY MEMBER REV FRIEDMAN JUST POINTED OUT THIS IS AN EXCITING EFFORT- AND ONE THAT- CERTAINLY I THINK CITIZENS TO CALIFORNIA REALLY WELCOME. I WOULD LIKE TO CONTRAST TO SERVE PROGRAM AND THE CONTINUOUS FUNDING ASPECTS OF IT WITH THE- CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM THAT'S OUT THERE AS WE LOOK AT THIS FROM OVERSIGHT. I THINK OVERALL THE LEGISLATURE'S EXPRESSING GROWING INTEREST IN MAKING SURE WE ACT EXERCISE APPROPRIATE OVERSIGHT- AS WE MOVE FORWARD AND SO MY CONCERN WAS THE CONTINUOUS FUNDING ASPECT OF THIS IS IT SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASES. OF THE ABILITY OF THE LEGISLATURE- TO EXERCISE ITS OVERSIGHT FUNCTION- WITH- THIS PROGRAM NOW I'VE REALIZED THAT THERE'S LESS OF AN ISSUE HERE BECAUSE IF YOU TAKE THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM- THERE IS AN INHERENT TO PUSH- BY SIGNIFICANT FORCES TO NOT. HAVE THE ALLOWANCES BE REDUCED TO- TO SORT OF TAKE ACTUALLY TO HAVE MORE LOUNGES OUT THERE WHEREAS WITH THIS PROGRAM I THINK WE'RE GOING TO FIND INDUSTRIES GOING TO BE ENCOURAGING US TO. TO MAKE THE INVESTMENTS BUT THERE STILL IS A NEED I THINK WE'VE SEEN AFTER SO MANY OTHER ISSUES- THERE STILL IS A NEED FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO HAVE APPROPRIATE OVERSIGHT HERE- BECAUSE WE'VE SEEN WITH OTHER PROGRAMS. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE- YOU KNOW SOMETHING SOMETHING SHOW UP AND FIND THAT THERE IS A INAPPROPRIATE INFLUENCED BY SOME PEOPLE BECAUSE THESE ARE- WORK WE'RE GOING TO. BE PARTNERING WITH THE PRIVATE SECTOR- TO DECIDE THESE INVESTMENT LOCATIONS X. SENTARA- SO I'M INTERESTED IN TRYING TO MAKE SURE THE LEGISLATURE KEEPS APPROPRIATE OVERSIGHT- OF THE FINANCIAL SIDE OF THIS AND USES THE INCENTIVE OF THAT OVERSIGHT TO MAKE SURE THE PROGRAM IS IMPLEMENTED- APPROPRIATELY- SO AS WE- AS WE HEARD THIS IS A DYNAMIC AREA THINGS ARE CHANGING- WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION- X. AND- OF FUNDS THAT ARE. WAY THAT DISK- WITH THE LEGISLATURE'S VIEW IN TERMS OF THE SAME CHANGING SO MY QUESTION- AFTER SAYING ALL THIS IS- COULD YOU IDENTIFY- AND COME BACK COULD DO MINISTRATION COME BACK WITH- A BREAK DOWN THE L. A. O. IS SUGGESTING. OF BREAKING THIS INTO A FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR- INVESTMENT AND THEN A SECOND FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT- SO THAT WE HAVE LESS INTEREST COST UP FRONT BUT ALSO GIVES US AN OPPORTUNITY TO. TO CHECK IT TOO TO RE EXAMINE THE PROGRAM WERE GOING HOW THE FUNDS ARE BEING EXPANDED I WOULD LIKE TO SEE AN ADVANTAGE AND DISADVANTAGE SORT OF SHE- AS I KNOW THERE ARE SOME DISADVANTAGES OF THAT AND BUT I ALSO KNOW THAT THERE ARE SOME ADVANTAGES TO THAT- THAT WOULD BE. HELPFUL FOR ME I WOULD ALSO BE. BENEFIT FROM UNDERSTANDING MORE HOW THE PARTNERSHIPS WILL GO IN TERMS OF THE EKITI PARTNERSHIPS WITH PRIVATE INDUSTRY. FOR THE ISSUE THESE INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS TO WHAT EXTENT WILL- THE PUBLIC'S TAXPAYER DOLLARS ACTUALLY- CREATE A- UP A PUBLIC BENEFIT THAT'S NOT JUST GOING O BE SOMETHING THAT WHOEVER WE PARTNER WITH FOR THE PRIVATE- INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT. DAY GAME- BUT WE HAVE SOME OTHER REQUIREMENTS IN THERE I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW WILL ELECTRICITY RATES SHOULD BE- SUBSIDIZED IN ANYWAY FOR EXAMPLE FOR LOW INCOME PEOPLE. I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THAT INFORMATION IF IT'S POSSIBLE AS WE MOVE FORWARD. THE FINAL THING I WOULD JUST OFFER I'D LIKE YOU TO- CONSIDER. IS THAT THE MIX BETWEEN. WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT ARE ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES COULD SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS. AND TO CERTAINLY ELECTRICITY IS GOING TO BE A BIG PART OF IT BUT WHAT'S THE PROPER MIX BETWEEN HYDROGEN. AND ELECTRIC VEHICLES ARE IS HYDROGEN ONLY GOING TO BE- FOR HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES- IS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION'S PLAN THAT'S LIKE TO UNDERSTAND WHERE THE ADMINISTRATION IS NOW. IN WHAT KIND OF- HOW NIMBLE THE ADMINISTRATION THINKS WE NEED TO BE FOR ADJUSTMENTS IN THE FUTURE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WELL ARE. THE THIRD STATUS SOME OF THE QUESTIONS YOU REYES AND THEN IF I MISSED SOMETHING PLEASE LET ME KNOW- SO I THINK YOU KNOW ON THE- ON THE NEXT BETWEEN- WHAT THAT VEHICLE. FLEET COULD LOOK LIKE GOING FORWARD I MEAN THERE ARE CLEAR SIGNAL. GLOBALLY THAT INVESTMENT IN BATTERY ELECTRIC VEHICLES IS THAT IS OCCURRING AND IT'S RAPID. BATTERY PRICES ARE HAVE GOT 90% OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS AND THEIR- YOU KNOW THIS IS HAPPENING NOT JUST IN THE U. S. BUT IN CHINA AND EACH YEAR IN INDIA. SO THIS IS I THINK A STOPPABLE AT THIS POINT IN TERMS OF. THAT KIND OF WRITING ON THE WALL THAT. AT LEAST ON THE BATTERY FIVE OR MAKING A LOT OF PROGRESS ON THE FINANCIAL SIDE I HAVE A LONG CLOAK. ESPECIALLY IN THE MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY SPACE. WHERE I DON'T THINK BATTERIES- CAN MEET ALL THE NEEDS AND THE DUTY CYCLE. OF THE FACTORY FEELING OF HYDROGEN THERE THERE'S JUST A LOT OF BENEFITS IT'S NOT TIME SENSITIVE INJURED I THINK. THERE'S SOME SOME REAL BENEFITS- ON ON HYDROGEN SIDE AND IS THIS THE SPECIALLY I THINK IT'S AN ISSUE ON THE MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY FIVE. AGAIN WE'RE STARTING INCREASED INVESTMENT WERE NOTICING IN CALIFORNIA AND THE INVESTMENTS THAT WE'RE MAKING ON THE FIELDING SIDE. THAT- THAT THE PUBLIC SHARE IS DECREASING AND THE PRIVATE SHARE IS INCREASING INCRETIN FACTOR EVEN SEEING SOME HYDROGEN STATIONS BEING FULLY- FUNDED BY THE PRIVATE SECTOR. SO THERE'S GOOD SIGNS ON THE HYDROGEN AND FUEL CELL SIDE AS WELL- WHAT THE NEXT WILL BE YOU KNOW. WE DO INDETERMINABLE. WE DO NEED TO LIKE. ACT TO BE ABOUT. FOR WHERE MARKET. AND WHAT ARE INVEST IS EASY TO SUPPORT THAT GROWING MARKET. YEAH ARE YOU FOR. GOING BIG NOW. IS THAT. THEIR MISSION VEHICLE IMPISH IF A BARRIER TO BE. A TO BUY- ANOTHER TO SEE IF. AND WHEN I SAY ELECTRIC IF YOU THE BATTERY OR FUEL CELL AFTER THEY'RE BOTH UP FOR THE TECH. AND SO ENSURING THAT WE HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE USING THE ANALYTICAL. THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS US THE ISSUE HAS- IT'S OF THE VALUE. EVERY OTHER YEAR WHERE'S THE MARKET- GOING IN TERMS OF- YOU KNOW OUR OUR- OUR THEIR MISSION VEHICLE INFRASTRUCTURE. AND REALLY. RETOOLING ARE INVESTMENTS. BASED ON THAT INFORMATION- ON THE YOU KNOW THE PROPOSAL THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS MADE REALLY FOR IN A EQUITY WHICH IS A I REALLY TO ONE EMPHASIZE YOUR TALKED ABOUT YOU KNOW LIKE RATES LOW INCOME PEOPLE FROM MY PERSPECTIVE THANK CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE HALF OF PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA BRENT. 30% WITHIN MULTI FAMILY DWELLINGS IT'S NOT CONVENIENT TO BY INTERMISSION VEHICLE YOU'RE AFRAID YOU YOU CAN'T DO IT AND YOU CAN'T REFILL YOUR VEHICLE- THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS FROM HAVING ELECTRIC VEHICLES ARE LARGE BILL SO YOU KNOW TERM OR BETWEEN ELEVEN TO ELEVEN HUNDRED TO SEVENTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS PER YEAR ARE THE SAVINGS FROM REDUCED FUEL COSTS WHAT COULD BE CHEAPER THAN GASOLINE. AND REDUCE MAINTENANCE COSTS SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT LOW INCOME FAMILIES CAN BENEFIT FROM THE LOWER LIFE CYCLE CSTS THE BATTERY ELECTRIC VEHICLE AND TO DO THAT WE NEED INFRASTRUCTURE WE KNOW A LOT OF INFRASTRUCTURE AND WE NEED IT NOW SO THERE'S THIS. THAT'S THE REASON WE'RE GOING BIG WITH THIS BILLION DOLLAR PROPOSAL IT'S SO THAT WE CAN OVERCOME THIS MAJOR BARRIERS TO DEPLOYMENT OF ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES AND MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY BENEFITS. AND ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE A LOW INCOME FAMILY. IF I COULD FOR UP UP WITH A HI LIZ CAREFULLY- TWO YEAR AND- EARLIER- FROM OF TO THE FROM SAN MEMBER FOR. A SORT OF OVER. AND IT AND THE AS A LIST DOLLARS THEY THEY WERE ALL WERE PRO. AND THEY WERE ALL- HEALTHY- OVERSIGHT ACTIVE. BUT I FELT A LITTLE BIT LIKE WHEN I LISTEN TO SOME A. R. B. THINGS THERE THERE WAS A REPORT A. R. B. HAD TO GIVE A REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE AND THEY AND THEY DID GIVE A REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE BUT WHEN THE REPORTS SAID THEY WEREN'T GOING TO BE MAKING ANY MODIFICATIONS IT WAS LIKE EVERYTHING FELL FLAT BECAUSE- OF THEY WERE GOING TO BE CHANGING HOW THEY WERE OPERATING SO WHILE THOSE ARE. CERTAINLY APPROPRIATE I DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE SUFFICIENT FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO HAVE THAT SENSE OF- HEY WE WANT TO WE WANT TO HAVE A VOICE IN MODIFYING OR CHANGING THIS PROGRAM AS IT GOES FORWARD SO- I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE- THAT YOU HAVE SOME AND HOPE THAT WE COULD FIND SOME WAYS TO HAVE MORE. AND MORE APPROPRIATE ONES AS WE GO FORWARD. THE AS YOU ALSO MENTIONED ABOUT- YOU KNOW THE MIX AND THE CHARGING I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT. ONE OF MY CONCERNS HERE IS IT TAKES THIRTY MINUTES RIGHT NOW IN TERMS OF THE CHARGING- YOU COULD HAVE THAT'S THIRTY MINUTES A IN TERMS OF TRAVEL TIME. TO WAIT. BUT IF YOU PULL INTO A PLACE AND THERE ARE ALREADY OTHER PEOPLE THAT'S THIRTY MINUTES AFTER YOU GET PLUGGED IN AND- SO I THINK WE HAVE A HUGE. WE HAVE A HUGE HURDLE TO OVERCOME TO HAVE PEOPLE FEEL CONFIDENT THAT- ELECTRIC VEHICLES- BY THEMSELVES. ARE GOING TO BE ABLE WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE CHARGING FAST ENOUGH AND SO I HOPE WE REALLY SHOULD PAY A LOT OF ATTENTION TO. HOW DO WE HANDLE MULTIPLE AUTOMOBILES PULLING INTO A CHARGING AREA AND ALL HOPING TO GET CHARGE QUICKLY AND BE ABLE TO CONTINUE ON THEIR JOURNEY. SO WE CAN WORK ON THAT AND CERTAINLY HYBRID IS ONE OF THE WAYS THAT- WE CAN HAVE THAT AT CEMEX THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER RIVAS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- I AM LIKE MY COLLEAGUES I AM PLEASED TO SEE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS COMMITTING- TO DECREASE EMISSIONS FROM THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR OF AS A JOINT AUTHORS OF AB THIRTEEN EIGHTY NINE LED BY SSEMBLY MEMBER RAY YES- I WANT TO DISCUSS THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL RELATED TO. OF THE CLEAN TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM I THINK THIS PROGRAM HAS TREMENDOUS VALUE AND I HOPE WERE ABLE TO HAVE- A DISCUSSION ON UPDATES TO THIS PROGRAM OF YEAH I THINK IT'S CRITICAL THAT WE PRIORITIZE INVESTMENTS IN COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN IMPACTED BY POLLUTION- SO THE QUESTIONS I HAVE ARE. THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE WOULD CONTINUOUSLY APPROPRIATE ABA REVENUE BUT IT DOESN'T CONTAIN ANY PROGRAM CHANGES TO THE CLEAN TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM IS THE ADMINISTRATION OPEN TO CHANGES TO THE PROGRAM. WHAT RIGHT NOW THE PROGRAM FOCUSES ON DIVERSIFYING OUR- TRANSPORTATION FUELS BEYONCE SIX BILLION AND- THAT YOU KNOW THE LANGUAGE IS VERY SPECIFIC IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW WE CAN'T PICK WINNERS AND WE NEED TO FIND THE DIVERSITY OF DIFFERENT ALTERNATIVES TO PETROLEUM WHAT WE'VE TRIED TO DO THROUGH OUR ANNUAL INVESTMENTS AND WITH OUR- ADVISORY COMMITTEE THAT WE RECENTLY REFRESHED ACTUALLY TO HAVE A GREATER FOCUS ON EQUITY AND COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATION NOT CONCERNED- WE YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN FOCUSING MORE IN A IN RECENT YEARS ON HERE MISSION MOBILITY- SO I YOU KNOW I LEAVE IT TO THE LEGISLATURE REALLY TO DECIDE WHAT WHAT LANGUAGE IS APPROPRIATE IF ANYTHING RIGHT NOW WE'RE JUST ASKING FOR A STRICT- EXTENSION OF THE DEADLINE. OKAY I'M IS THE PLAN TO MAKE THE CLEAN TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM EXCLUSIVELY AS ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAM. SO WHAT WHAT WE FIND IS IT THROUGH THE CLEAN TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM IS NOT JUST THEIR MISSION VEHICLE INFRASTRUCTURE BUT ALSO. FUEL PRODUCTION WILL PARTNERSHIP PRODUCTION WE FIND- SOME WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT WE PROVIDE WE HAVE IN THE PAST PROVIDED LOANS FOR MANUFACTURED NOT LONG BUT START GRANTS FOR MANUFACTURED EUROVISION VEHICLE THAT FACTORED IN THE STATE SO- WE FIND A VARIETY OF OTHER. INVESTMENTS RELATED TO FUEL PRODUCTION AND- TO THEIR MISSION GICLEE ENACTED SENSE INFRASTRUCTURE FADHLI- WE HAVE OVER TIME BECOME MUCH MORE FOCUSED JUST ON THE- IF YOU'LL FIND. BILLION WITH THAT PARTNERSHIP WE HAVE WITH THE RESOURCES BOARD DAY FUND VEHICLES WE FIND THAT FUELS AND INFRASTRUCTURE AND SO WHILE HISTORICALLY WE DID TO OUR FUNDING IN VEHICLES WE WITH WITH ZERO THOSE OUT THAT FOR US THAT THERE'S NO MORE CLEAR BETWEEN WALLS OF WHAT THE ERROR HE DOES WHAT THE ENERGY COMMISSION DOT. OKAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU- I HAVE A COUPLE AND THEN I THINK CHARACTER- SOME QUESTIONS TO ASK- I THINK IT'S A NOTEWORTHY IN THE PROPOSED THAT- IN THE TWENTY NINETEEN AND TWENTY TWENTY- THERE WAS TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS IN- A CV R. P. FUNDING FOR LIGHT DUTY VEHICLES AND THEIR REBATES AND THERE'S- A ZERO IN THIS BUDGET- AS- OF. IS THAT- THE INTENTION TO- SIMPLY AND THIS PROGRAM OR IS THERE A REPLACEMENT PROGRAM THAT'S BEING CONSIDERED. HI LIZZY YOU'RE A PART OF THANK YOU SO MUCH I'VE FOR THE BEST AND WE DO KNOW THAT- THEY MINISTRATION KNOWLEDGES THAT THE SENIOR P. PROGRAM HAS HELPED SUPPORT CONSUMERS PURCHASE OF ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES BUT THERE ARE ALSO. SO EXISTING PROGRAMS IN PLACE THAT PROVIDE REBATES FOR PASSENGERS ADS ON AS YOUR WHERE TO SPEND HIGHLIGHTED IN THE AGENDA OF THE CLEAN FILLER WORDS PROGRAM PROVIDES A FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLAR AND ON AND ON THE VEHICLE AND INCENTIVES. AND WE ARE ALSO FIRST COMMITTED TO RE EVALUATING AS WE DO EVERY YEAR THE EXPENDITURE PLAN. FOR CAP AND TRADE FOR ME REPRESENT. I SORRY I DIDN'T THAT LAST PART. CERTAINLY AND AS HAS BEEN OUR PREVIOUS PRACTICE WE WILL EVALUATE IT CAP AND TRADE EXPENDITURES ENDS WITH MORNING FOR ME SHANE WOULD BE VERY OPTION PROCEEDS IT'S AND WILL BE BRING FORTH AND UPDATED CAP AND TRADE EXPENDITURE PLAN MAY REVISION I SEE- SO YOU ARE- OPEN TO CONSIDERING FUNDING CVR P. BUT- POTENTIALLY. THROUGH CAP AND TRADE. I CAN'T COMMENT ON SPECIFICS AT THIS TIME OF WHAT WE MAY BE OPEN TO BACK WE WILL BE REVISITING AFTER. WELL OKAY THAT LEAVES ME THINKING THAT- MAYBE THIS IS JUST AN EFFORT TO PERMANENTLY TERMINATE THE- PROGRAM AND I'D APPRECIATE SOME CLARITY ON THAT- AS- YOU YOURSELF JUST SAID IT'S A- VERY POPULAR PROGRAM- AND- AS YOUR ANSWERING BECAUSE- THAT QUESTION PERHAPS YOU CAN- LET ME KNOW IF YOU FOR A- HOW IT. TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION THE VIEWPOINT OF MANUFACTURERS WHO ARE CHARGED WITH SELLING THESE VEHICLES WE WANT THEM TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN SELLING AND LEASING- ZEV VEHICLES WHAT IS THEIR PERSPECTIVE AS IT'S BEEN EXPRESSED TO YOU. THAT SORRY I'M NOT SURE I CAN SPEAK TO THAT QUESTION PERHAPS MY COLLEAGUE AT THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD MEDIA OF MY TIME IS GENERAL FOR WHOEVER CAN ANSWER. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBERS OF THE NEIGHBOR JUST AGAIN FROM CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD YES YOU'RE CERTAINLY CORRECT- THAT HISTORICALLY CTRP HAS PLAYED AN IMPORTANT ROLE AS A COMPLEMENT TO OUR REGULATIONS WHICH- REQUIRE MANUFACTURERS TO BRING ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES TO MARKET. US EASIER P. AND OTHER VEHICLES THAT ARE PROGRAMS THAT HELPS THEN ON THE CONSUMER SIDE HELPING TO FACILITATE AND- AND HELP CONSUMERS MAKE THAT CHOICE. M. DOUG OF THE MANUFACTURERS ARE HARDLY ON THE SIDELINES ON THIS BECAUSE WE ARE REQUIRING THEM TO UP A PROVIDE THESE VEHICLES. HAVE YOU CONSULTED WITH THE INDUSTRY AND WHAT IS THEIR PERSPECTIVE ON WHAT APPEARS TO BE AN EFFORT TO TERMINATE THE CVR P. PROGRAM. I'M SURE HEARING- VERY SIMILAR THINGS TO YOU ARE OF COURSE- I SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET- BUT OF COURSE WE DO HEAR FROM MANUFACTURERS OF BOTH THE LIGHT MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY SPACE. OF COURSE THAT THAT INCENTIVES PLAYED IMPORTANT ROLES A COMPLIMENT TO GET EARLY REDUCTIONS TO MEET OUR REGULATIONS SO WHILE WHILE I HAVE YOU- I THINK A OR B. AS THE RIGHT. TO AGENCY TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION- WE HAVE TO. MAJOR FUELING SOURCES FOR THE VEHICLES WE HAVE A LECTURE VEHICLES WITH HYDROGEN- HYDROGEN BY COMPARISON TO. A LECTURE GOOD OF VEHICLES IS STILL AN INDUSTRY THAT'S IN ITS INFANCY AND THE TECHNOLOGY IS MOVING FORWARD- AND IN SOME WAYS DRAMATICALLY BUT BUT- I THINK STILL SOMEWHAT BEHIND IN TERMS OF ITS MATURATION COMPARE TO- OF ELECTRIC VEHICLES- WE'VE PROVIDED BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF INCENTIVES AND BENEFITS AND- FUNDING. FOR THE ELECTRIC SIDE BUT COMPARATIVELY I'M NOT SAYING IT'S A SMALL AMOUNT OF MONEY BUT COMPARATIVELY LITTLE- FOR HYDROGEN AND I NOTE IN- OF THE PROPOSED BUDGET- IT SEEMS TO BE A MAINTENANCE OF EFFORT TO IN TERMS OF. OF THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT IS BUDGET- FUELING CUT HYDROGEN FUELING INFRASTRUCTURE- IS IN A PLACE WHERE IT NEEDS TO CATCH UP JUST LIKE WITH- OF LECTURE CUT. A FUELING STATIONS WE NEED- MORE UBIQUITOUS SET UP FUELING INFRASTRUCTURE FOR HYDROGEN AND THERE'S ALSO A LOT OF WORK BEING DONE TO- ADVANCED HYDROGEN SO THAT IT IS IN FACT A- THE- THE HYDROGEN ITSELF IS SUSTAINABLY PRODUCED- SO WHY THESE ARE THE TWO MAJOR BARRIERS I THINK- IN TERMS OF MOVING THAT TECHNOLOGY FORWARD WHY IS THERE NO INCREASE- THIS YEAR- IN- THE HYDROGEN SECTOR- PARTICULARLY WHEN WE COMPARE IT TO WHAT IS PROPOSED. FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLES. ASSEMBLY MEMBER ILET ME- I WOULD RESPOND TO THAT QUESTION A CHARGER. SO THE EVERY PERSON BOARD AT ITS MORE ON THE VEHICLES WERE MORE THAT IN AND SITE SO LET ME TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE- WAYS WERE. HYDROGEN RIGHT NOW. THE AB EIGHT REQUIRE US START- YOU KNOW THAN TWENTY. OF THE FUNDS TOWARDS A PUBLICLY AVAILABLE HYDROGEN INFRASTRUCTURE UP TO HUNDRED STATIONS ARE WE'RE ACTUALLY IN OUR- OUR OUR PLAN IS TO GO. BEYOND A HUNDRED STATION AND WE'RE- WITH THAT STATED THAT WE ARE FUNDING AND WHAT'S FUNDED BY PRIVATE INDUSTRY WE'RE EXPECTING A HUNDRED SEVENTY NINE STATIONS WILL BE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE- AND- THEN THOSE STATIONS WILL FUND WILL SUPPORT AT LEAST A HUNDRED THOUSAND PROBABLY CLOSER TO TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND SHALL SELL ELECTRIC VEHICLES. BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE IN ST IT IS EXPECTING ABOUT FIFTY THOUSAND FUEL CELL VEHICLE SO WE SHOULD HAVE A INFRASTRUCTURE TO FAR EXCEED WHAT THE- MANUFACTURERS SAY IT'S GOING TO BE AVAILABLE ON THE FUEL PUMP SIDE ON BY TO THE VEHICLES. IN TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. WE ARE USING OUR FIVE TO SIT BOTH- ZERO CARBON HYDROGEN PRODUCTION. AND TO SOME MEDIUM AND HEAVY. STILL SOME ALSO- THEY SAID BEFORE THAT A FACTOR I THINK YOU KNOW. WE REALLY NEED. A BATTERY LIFE FOR AND FUEL CELL ELECTRIC THE TO- TO HELP US. ACHIEVE OUR GOAL. ARE FULLY ELECT THAT SET. SO FROM AMERICA FIRST AND I THINK YOU POINTED OUT FROM SO IT WE FEEL IT CAN BE. THERE'S A LOT OF THE DAMAGE TIGER- AND WE ARE SUPPORTING WITH OUR FUNDS BOTH. JUST ELECTRIC VEHICLES. HEARD OF THE THANK YOU MISTER TEN. THANK ME TO CHURCH A COUPLE- THAN ANY OF IN THE FIVE. FROM THE MYSTERY COULD ANSWER I. GOING BACK- TO THE- AGENDA- THE DOCUMENT I THINK OF INFORMATION FROM THE- RESOURCES BOARD- WE GO THAT TRANSPORTATION IS 40% OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS IN THAT PASSENGER VEHICLES ARE ABOUT. 80% OF THAT TRANSPORTATION'S GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS SO WHY FIVE JUST GOING BACK TO MY COLLEAGUES QUESTION WHY WAS THERE NO FUNDING FOR THE CLEAN VEHICLE REBATE PROGRAM AND THE PROPOSAL. YOUR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCING AND THANK YOU HAVE A QUESTION WE DO UNDERSTAND THE LEGISLATURE. IN THIS PROGRAM WHAT ARE THE EXPENDITURE PLAN INCLUDES FOUR HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN FUNDING FOR CLEAN VEHICLE PROGRAMS THAT FOCUS ON LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS AND REDUCING AIR POLLUTION FROM HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES SO THAT IS WHERE. BASED ON THE LIMITED FUNDING THAT WE HAVE THAT IS WHERE WE HAVE PROPOSED TO ALLOCATE. THESE DOLLARS. SO THAT THERE IS THERE IS A DECISION MAKE. TO MOVE THE MONEY FROM C. B. R. P. AND OTHER PEOPLE CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT OTHER PROPOSALS WHERE WHERE THE MONEY'S GETTING MOVED TO. CERTAINLY SO WE DO NOT VIEW THIS DOES THAT NECESSARILY MOVING BUT- WE HAVE NOT MADE A DOLLAR THIRTY PLUS BUT YOU JUST SAID YOU SAID LIMITED DOLLARS. THROUGH THE PROPRIOCEPTIVE FROM YEARS PAST AND NOW THERE'S A REAL. GOOD MOVIE OF APPROPRIATIONS O DOLLARS HAVE BEEN MOVED SO. THAT'S WHAT YOU JUST SAID. RIGHT I UNDERSTAND AND WE ARE LIMITED AS YOU'VE NOTED BASED ON THE CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATIONS. I HAVE A VERY LIMITED FUNDING WE ARE PROPOSING ONE HUNDRED ITEMS. EIGHT SO I AYE APOLOGIES AYE WE ARE PROPOSED TO FOCUS ON EQUITY PROGRAMS AND ON AND HAVE THE DUTY EAT THE APPLES AND TRANSPORTATION PROGRAMS MY AIRPORT COLLEAGUES ARE AVAILABLE TO SPEAK MORE TO HOW THOSE PROGRAM SUPPORT ACT BETTER OVERALL ZERO EMISSION. AND CLEAN TRANSPORTATION BILLS ONE OF THAT THAT'S FINE I JUST I JUST WANNA KNOW SO THE LAST YEAR OR TWO YEARS AGO WE APPROPRIATE ABOUT WITH A TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION. SO WHERE WHERE IS THAT. TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION BEING APPROPRIATE TO. CAN YOU WALK ME THROUGH IN DETAIL. PLEASE. I WOULD BE HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP WITH YOUR OFFICE ON THE SPECIFIC QUESTION WAIT UNTIL YOUR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE YOU CAN'T WALK ME THROUGH. WHERE THE ADMINISTRATION PLANS ON SPENDING TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS. HOW HOW IS.

WE DO THAT AND PROVIDE IT TO THE BUDGET COMMITTEE TO AT THE UP- THE SHOW THAT ALLOCATION THAT WERE IN PLACE- TWENTY TWENTY ONE COMPARED TO THE CAN. AND ALSO WITH MY- COLLEAGUES ON THE APPEARING WE OFFER AN UPDATE COVENTRY PLANS WE'RE NOT WE'RE AND APPROPRIATE- DEATH OPTION AVAILABLE. TO AFTER MEMBER CAN CAN. JUST MENTION ONE THING WHICH I COME UP YET BUT WE THE REPORT THAT- THERE. FOR LOW CARBON STANDARD IS GOING TO BE FROM FOR A VEHICLE IN. AND- UNLIKE THEIR KEYBOARD YOU HAVE TO LIKE A LOT OF FARM AND IT. THIS IS A CASH THE HOOD CENTER AND DATA IN THAT THESE ARE MUCH MORE ACTIVE INTER OF DRIVING THE MARKET THAT- AT YOU'RE HAVING WHEN YOU SEE THE- ME WALKING OF ZERO ANYTHING ON THE FIFTEEN DOLLARS. THE VEHICLE DOESN'T THAT'S THE MATH MASSIVE SENATE VIA BY THE SO JUST IT JUST HIGHLIGHT THERE IS A- VEHICLE THAT. WRAPPED UP THAT I ARE SOME ADVANTAGES OVER WHAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW WITH YOU DEAR. IT'S NOT CLEAR THAT IT'S BEEN COMPLETELY ADOPTED BY ALL. FROM ALL MANUFACTURERS WERE AS THE QUEEN VEHICLE REPAIR PROGRAM HOUSE- I WOULD JUST READ REITERATE TO DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WITH THIS THIS IS. THIS IS BUDGET COMMITTEE IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT IF YOU'RE THERE'S- YOU KNOW NINE PEOPLE LISTED TO TESTIFY IF THERE'S NOBODY HERE WHO CAN ANSWER. QUESTIONS REGARDING NUMBERS I THINK IT'S NOT REALLY THE BEST USE OF THIS COMMITTEES TIME- SO I WOULD JUST ASK THAT- YOU KNOW THAT THAT. IN THE FUTURE THAT THE THAT THE FIRE DEPARTMENT COME BETTER PREPARED WITH SPECIFIC NUMBERS. ARMED GOING BACK TO THE DISCUSSION AROUND- SORT OF THAT THE MOVEMENT TOWARD- LOW INCOME OUR LOW INCOME CUSTOMERS- DO YOU DO YOU HAVE NUMBERS IN TERMS OF SORT OF HOW MANY LOW INCOME CUSTOMERS YOU HAPPEN TO BE- HOW MANY LOW INCOME CUSTOMERS COMING FAMILIES YOU PUT YOU PLAN ON OF ASSISTING WITH EACH YEAR PROGRAMS. THREE THOUSAND AGAIN WITH THE PART IN THE FINANCE I DON'T HAVE THAT. NUMBER OF PERSONS SERVING FOR PROGRAMS AND- I CAN DEFERRED IRRESISTIBLE. BECAUSE IT WILL HAVE TO GET TO THE COMMITTEE. IF THAT'S AVAILABLE ON THAT'S MY AVAILABLE. EVERY TRANSPORT PLEASE. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE QUESTION- I'M HAPPY TO CHIME IN WITH- SOME HISTORICAL NUMBERS BUT IF THAT'S NOT EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR WERE HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOUR OFFICE TO GET YOU EXACTLY WHAT YOU NEED- ONE OF THE PROGRAMS- THAT IT WILL POINT TO AS IT'S HIGHLIGHTED IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET IS STAY CLEAN CARS FOR ALL SCRAP AND REPLACE PROGRAM. SO THIS IS A PROGRAM THAT- TARGETED AT LOW INCOME CONSUMERS AND IS INTENDED TO HELP ACCELERATE GETTING- POLLUTING PASSENGER VEHICLES OFF THE ROAD IN GETTING FOLKS INTO CLEANER MODES OF MOBILITY SO THE NUMBERS I HAVE ON THAT IS THAT THERE'S OVER ELEVEN THOUSAND CARS THAT HAVE BEEN REPLACED DUE TO THIS PROGRAM OVER TIME. OVER OVER HOW MANY YEARS APPROXIMATELY. BUT LET ME DOUBLE CHECK ON THAT FOR YOU I'M SO SORRY GIVE A ROUGH ESTIMATE HOW MANY YEARS WE'RE TALKING. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A DECADE. IT'S ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO. IT ANY OTHER. SO THAT'S THAT'S ONE OF A NUMBER OF PROGRAMS LISTED DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER INFORMATION ON THE OTHER PROGRAMS THAT YOU'VE- HIGHLIGHTED FOR PLAN TO SPEND MONEY ON. SURE I'LL BE HAPPY TO ONE THING WE CAN FOLLOW UP WITH YOUR OFFICE WITH WE ARE ALSO HAPPY TO PROVIDE AND NUMBERS IN TERMS OF THAT NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE FINANCING ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. OF COURSE ANY DATING YOU DON'T SEE IF YOU'RE KEY AND IF THERE'S OTHER PROGRAMS YOU'RE INTERESTED IN AS WELL. HAPPY TO PROVIDE THAT TO YOU. ONE INTERESTED IN ALL OF THEM SO YOU'RE YOU'RE I MEAN. THIS THIS IS THE HEARING THE HEARING IS LISTING- YOU KNOW OVER A BILLION DOLLARS OF EXPENDITURE ON PROGRAMS AND YOU'RE ONLY PREPARED TO TALK ABOUT ONE PROGRAM. YOU KNOW I COULD SPEAK A LITTLE BIT AT THE TOP ON THE CLINTON PROTECTION PROGRAM ABSOLUTELY NOT RIGHT WHO EQUITY INVESTMENT. YEAH SO APPROXIMATELY ONE THIRD RUN BACK TO DATE HAS BEEN PRETTY GOOD BANDS IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. AND GOING FORWARD OUR TARGET IS AT LEAST 50% ON A PORTFOLIO BASIS POTENTIALLY EVEN HIGHER. BONTA PROGRAMS SUCH A MEETING COULD BE HEAVY DUTY. WHERE WE KNOW THAT WOULD BE CONCERNED EVEN. MORE ACUTE FROM DIESEL EMISSION. AREA THAT WE'RE REALLY TALKING ON AND EVEN HAVE PRINCIPLES HEALTH OF GOD THAT. HELLO OKAY BUT THAT DOESN'T GIVE ME A SENSE OF- AND I UNDERSTAND WITH THE HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES WITH A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT BECAUSE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT MOBILE SOURCES ARE A BIT IN TERMS OF THE OTHER PROGRAMS WHICH ARE DIRECT. OF APPROPRIATIONS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR ACHIEVING THE GOAL WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW MANY. FAMILIES WHO ARE. ASSISTING SO. DO YOU HAVE ANY MORE INFORMATION THAN WHAT YOU JUST GAVE. YEAH WE'D BE HAPPY TO PULL TOGETHER TO NUMBERS ON A PROGRAM BY PROGRAM BASIS WITH PORTFOLIO IF WE CAN DO IT ON A FAMILY BASIS AS WELL WITH THE INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT WE OFTEN LOOK AT WHERE WE LOCATE. TEMPERATURE WHICH QUITE CANDIDLY IT'S SOMETHING WE WANT TO GET EVEN BETTER AT KNOWING THAT ACCESS DOESN'T NECESSARILY NEED WHERE HYDROGEN STATION OR- ELECTRIC CHARGING STATIONS LOCATED BUT REALLY YOU KNOW WHO HAS ACCESS TO THAT INFRASTRUCTURE. IN OUR INAUGURAL SENATE BILL ONE THOUSAND REPORT WE STARTED TO LAY OUT THE INFORMATION WE DO HAVE AND WE DO SO THE WERE ACTUALLY LAGGING A LITTLE BIT IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES SO WE WANT TO SHARPEN THAT TARGET- ABSOLUTELY BUT ALSO LOOK AT WHAT ACCESS REALLY MEANS SAID THAT'LL BE SOMETHING- THAT WE DEFINITELY COULD ON OUR NEXT REPORT. SOMETHING WE'LL DO EVERY. YEAR BUT- WHAT WILL COME BACK YOU WHAT SOME MORE GRANULAR INTERNET. ON SPECIFIC PROGRAM BUT YOU FIND A- WONDERSTRUCK UNDERSTAND A MAJOR COMING FORWARD TO THIS COMMITTEE FOR OVER BILLION DOLLARS APPROPRIATION AND I'M- HEARING A LOT OF VERY LOFTY GOALS BUT NO DETAILED INFORMATION. SO COULD COULD ANYBODY HELP ME. WITH MORE DETAIL I'M NOT LIKE WHAT WHAT WHAT ARE WE GETTING FOR A BILLION AND A HALF DOLLARS. SO I'M JUST MAYBE TO BUILD OUT ON SOME OF THE ORGAN. SPECIFIC NUMBERS NOT IN WORD FOR ME WITH- JUSTICE FROM UNDERGROUND THIS IS BUDGET COMMITTEE SO AND BUDGET COMMITTEE WE TEND TO FOCUS ON YOU'RE ASKING FOR MONEY. MONEY BUYS A CERTAIN THINGS WITH LIKE THE FIRST PACIFIC'S OF WHAT THE MONEY IS BY. YEAH I COULD SPEAK A LITTLE BIT ON THE BOTTOM OF THE PACIFIC FROM HISTORICAL PROGRAM. WHAT WHAT ABOUT HIS MENTOR WHAT NOTE BOOK OF WHAT ABOUT FROM THE FUTURE I MEAN YOU'RE ASKING FOR A BILLION AND A HALF DOLLARS TO BUY WHAT. YEAH IT DOES WELL SO- REALLY THE FIRST FIVE HUNDRED MILLION FOR THE INFRASTRUCTURE PLEASE. IF THE CLOTHES THAT TWENTY TWENTY FIVE LIGHT PIZZA. WHICH IS ABOUT FIFTY THOUSAND CHARTER WE WANT TO DO THAT IN A COUPLE DIFFERENT WAYS. ONE IS TO EXPAND THE FIFTH US OF THE ECOLOGY I. P. PROGRAM. WHICH USES A LOT OF ANALYSIS FIFTY WHERE THERE'S GAPS. THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND THEN WE GO OUT WE TARGET THOSE GOT. TO MEET FOR THE ENTIRE STATE HAS A MINIMUM FLOOR OF ACCESS. AND EVEN WITHIN THAT WE HAVE EQUITY GOAL THAT WE MARK IT. UP TRUST BECAUSE ONE NOT- BUT WE WANT TO GO EVEN FURTHER THIS IS ONE CHALLENGE WHERE. WITH A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR WHICH WE HAVE NOW WHICH IS A LOT OF MONEY THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT. IT DOES LIMIT HOW WE MAKE OUR INVESTMENT. BECAUSE WE DO HAVE TO TRADE BETWEEN DUTY. AND MEDIUM DUTY HEAVY DUTY. WHAT IF I JUST FUNDING ON THE LIGHT FIVE. WILL BE ABLE TO HOLD. A MULTI MULTIPLE YOUR DWELLINGS ARE MODEST. TOOK THE TAPES AND WHICH WE WANT TO DO WHEN WE'RE WORKING RIGHT NOW TO MOVE THAT FORWARD. TO REALLY TARGET THAT TALK EVERY SEGMENT. IN M. U. D. WERE RENTERS OFTEN WHAT. WE'RE ALSO GOING TO LAUNCH THE RURAL COMMUNITIES. PROGRAM TO FOCUS ON RURAL COMMUNITIES BECAUSE AGAIN WE KNOW THAT THE AREA. WHAT WE CAN DO MORE. AND WE ALSO LOOK INTO POTENTIALLY WANT SOMETHING. ON HIGH MILEAGE VEHICLES LIKE TNCS. AND REALLY IT'S A PORTFOLIO APPROACH TO TAKE WHAT WORKING BUT THAT ALSO TARGET AREAS WHERE WE NEED MORE WORK- SO KNOW THAT THAT'S A LOT MORE I THINK THE GRANULAR THING. HOPEFUL THAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR. UNLIKE YOU DECIDE ALL. HYDROGEN FIVE WHICH SHOW THE GAPS. I'M SORRY NO GO AHEAD PLEASE. A THIRD ON THE HUNDRED SIDE WITH TO GO ABOUT TWO ONE- STATION FOR TWENTY TWENTY FIVE AND- WE THE JUST FUNDING WOULD BE UPLOAD THAT GAP WE ISSUED A NOTICE PROPOSED AND NOVA WHICH INDICATES- STATIONED YOU MEET OUR CRITERIA THAT WE COULD CONTINUE TO FUND DOWN. AND DEPLOY MORE THAT INFRASTRUCTURE OVER TIME. AND THEN ALSO SEE. THEM MEAT IN DUE TO HAVE DUTY MARK. AND WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS THAT THE AREA THAT AGAIN YEAH I THINK WE ALL KNOW THAT IT'S ALREADY BEEN SAID. BUT FOR A LOT OF THE DIESEL EMISSIONS COME FROM THAT'S WHERE YOU HAVE A CUTE EQUITY ISSUES AND FRANKLY. PEOPLE DIE FROM THAT RIGHT THIS CAUSES CANCER THIS BECAUSE OF THE HOUSE NOT THIS IS AN AREA. THAT WE DEFINITELY WANT TO TARGET AND THE MARKET IS COMING DOWN. TO A PLACE WHERE FIFTY DIFFERENT AND WE CAN BE RISKY. YEAH ONE THING THAT WE'VE LEARNED IS THAT A LOT OF TIMES THE BUSINESSES. AND LARGER COMPANIES THEY HAVE MANDATE RIGHT AND THEY'LL DO THEM BUT THEY MIGHT WAIT UNTIL LATER IN THE GAME TO ACHIEVE THE TARGET BECAUSE- THEY'RE WORRIED THEY HAVE AGGRESSIVE IN MAKING SOME DISCOMFORT THAT. YOU KNOW IF YOUR UPS DELIVERY VEHICLE OR TRANSPORTATION THE PRIMARY PURPOSE IS. TO DELIVER PACKAGES. LAURENT GIVE INVESTMENT CAN REALLY HELP REST. OF THEM. THAT HELP THEM ADOPT YOU KNOW CAN'T PULL AND THEN MORE AND MORE. VEHICLES BOTH A LOT. AND HYDROGEN. TO THE POINT WHERE THEY COMP. THAT ONE IT WILL FOR THE ROCK. THANK THANK YOU. THE ONLY NUMBER. THIRTY NUMBER HEARD WAS THOUSAND CHARGER. SO DOING DOLLARS FOR FIFTY THOUSAND CHARGERS WORKS OUT TO BE WHAT ABOUT TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A CHARGER. IS THAT IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE ANTICIPATING SUBSIDIZING SARDIS ALL LEVEL. THREE CHARGERS THAT YOU'RE PLANNING TO SUBSIDIZE. I THINK YOU'VE GOT A GREAT QUESTION- SO KELLY THE I. P. WE IS OUR PRIMARY LIGHT DUTY- PROGRAM WHICH DOES BOTH LEVEL TWO AND DC I THINK. AND IN THE PAST IT WAS ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR INVESTMENT ON LEVEL TWO THE PUBLIC DOLLAR THE PRIVATE SECTOR PICKED UP ABOUT. WE'VE GONE DOWN TO FORTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR LEVEL TWO CHARGER AND WE'RE GONNA PROPOSED EVEN GO FURTHER DOWN THE CARE. SHOWN TO TRANSITION FOR MORE MORE PRIVATE FUNDING ABOUT 66% OF THE LEVEL TWO CHARGER IT PAID WORK FOR SOMETHING IF FOUR. OUTSIDE THE MARKET HE WON WE FUNDING SO. ARE WE GETTING MORE THAN FIFTY THOUSAND CHARGERS. SO THAT THE WAY WE DID THE ANALYSIS TO LOOK AT HOW WE COVER THAT FIFTY TWO THOUSAND. GAP WITH A THREE HUNDRED MILLION AT THE PORTSMOUTH FOR LEVEL TWO PORT A PRETTY FAIR ENOUGH FOR THE FOUR HUNDRED M. AND WE TOOK AN APPROPRIATE SAID. IF WE WERE TO KEEP OUR FUNDING. FOR THE WORK THEY DON'T KNOW HOW. LONG BUT WORTHY OF THE NINE HUNDRED MILLION GOING. SO THE- OTHER FIVE HUNDRED MILLION. THREE HUNDRED MILLION. WILL GO TO A LIGHTED AFTER TRUCKERS THAT THREE HUNDRED. FIFTY TWO THOUSAND CHARTERED IN TWENTY ONE HUNDRED. AND THEN THE MEDIUM DUTY HEAVY DUTY MARKET. THAT VARY QUITE A BIT OF COMMERCE SUPERCHARGER TO COULD YOU CAN OPERATE WITHIN SO THE THREE HUNDRED MILLION FOR LIGHT DUTY INFRASTRUCTURE WHAT'S WITH THAT WHAT IS A- FIFTY TWO THOUSAND. CHARGERS ON THE EAST SIDE AND TWENTY ONE HUNDRED AND- YOU BECAUSE THE SECOND THAT YOU TALK ABOUT FIFTY THOUSAND ARTISTS ANNOUNCED SIXTY TWO THOUSAND CHARGERS ANSWER. I APOLOGIZE ABOUT THAT FIFTY AYE YEAH MISSPOKE FIFTY TWO THOUSAND THE GOT THAT RESPECT. FOR THE LIKE EIGHTY FIVE FOR TWENTY TWENTY FIVE BUT THAT'S FOR THREE HUNDRED MILLION RIGHT. FOR BOTH ELECTRIC AND HYBRID INSIDE FOR ABOUT FOR LIGHT DUTY FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE GOALS. OKAY- HE- SO THREE THREE HUNDRED MILLION. OKAY DIVIDED BY WHAT YOU SAID FORTY TWO HUNDRED OR FORTY FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE AND OR TALK ABOUT. FORTY FIVE HUNDRED FOR THE LEVEL TWO. FIFTY THOUSAND FOR THE DEFEAT OF THE- AND I WOULD NEED TO LOOK BUT I BELIEVE ONE POINT THREE MILLION FOUR HUNDRED AND FISHING. AND THAT'S ASSUMING A CONSTANT WE ACTUALLY WANT TO LIVE UPON ONE POINT THREE MILLION YEAR HER YEARS OF THE STATION TO THE COME WITH THE COME WITH THE POWER PLANT TO. I WILL SAY THIS WHICH IS REALLY ENCOURAGING HOW QUICKLY IN THE PAST WE PAY 430% I'M SORRY 5070% OF THE HUNDRED STATES AND WE'RE NOT FIFTY FIFTY AND THOSE ARE ACTUALLY TAKING THAT HAVE EVEN MORE CAPACITY THAN THEY DID IN THE PAST WHAT WE'RE SEEING AT HIGHER CAPACITY STATION. WITH YOUR PUBLIC DOLLARS. OKAY OKAY SO. WHEN I SAY LOOK I AM. A BIG FAN OF THE IDEA THAT WE NEED TO AFFRONT TO UPFRONT INVESTMENTS. ON AND THAT I THINK THE TIME IS DEFINITELY NOW SOME DEGREE FROM MY COLLEAGUE FROM- IN A GLENDALE THAT THE TIME IS DEFINITELY NOW TO BE INVESTING IN. THIS INFRASTRUCTURE HOWEVER I'M NOT CLEAR WHAT WE'RE INVESTING IN AND IT'S NOT CLEAR WHAT WERE. SPENDING THIS MONEY ON. SEOUL IF WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WE'RE GETTING FOR A BILLION DOLLARS AND THE ANSWER SEEMS TO HAVE CHANGED BY THE MINUTE- I DON'T KNOW THAT WE COULD APPROVE THAT SO LET ME LET ME JUST GO TO- THE TWO BUCKETS- THAT MY COLLEAGUE FROM VENTURA TALKED ABOUT EARLIER. IN TERMS OF. THE THREE HUNDRED FIFTEEN MILLION OVER TWO YEARS FOR HEAVY VEHICLES AND A HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION FOR TWO YEARS OVER THE TRANSPORTATION EQUITY PROGRAMS. ON OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW THAT THE WORD EQUITY'S BEEN MENTIONED QUITE A BIT AND FOR ME OBVIOUSLY IT MYSELF A LOT OF OUR COLLEAGUES. THE VERY SENSITIVE POINT THE THINK A LOT OF OUR COMMUNITIES FEEL LIKE THEY THEY HAVEN'T GOT ANY ANY BENEFIT FROM THESE PROGRAMS SO WE DO APPRECIATE THAT THERE IS. A KNOWLEDGE MENT OF THAT. WELL I'M HAVING SAID THAT- WHY IS THERE NO- DIRECT- APPROPRIATION FOR THESE PARTICULAR PROGRAMS. WE'VE GONE THE INFRASTRUCTURE SIDE OF THAT HELPFUL- EITHER QUIT TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM INVESTMENT PLAN TO DO A STAKEHOLDER PROCESS AND GOVERNOR INPUT FROM MARKET AND EQUITY COMMUNITIES THAT COMMUNITIES CAN HELP NOT ABOUT WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE WITH THE PLAN- YEAH THIS YEAR WE'RE LOOKING AT MORE ON MY TV AFTER TRUCKER WITH THE SHIP TO. MEET IF YOU HAVE A DUTY AND THEN WE ALSO DO WORKSHOPS THROUGH A PUBLIC PROCESS TO PROPOSED PUT THE TAPE IN SUCH A TREND THAT OUR GREAT TRUCK THINGS OF THAT NATURE AND GET INPUT TO REACT TO THE MARKET IF YOU WERE. TO COVER AND THEN DEPLOY THAT. SO WHY WHY YOU DOING THE PROP FIRST AND THEN COMING TO US. YOU KNOW I THINK IT'S A COMBINATION OF BOTH RIGHT I THINK SOMETIMES THE MARKET DOES NOT TAKE US SERIOUSLY IF WE DON'T HAVE MONEY TO BACK IT UP. YOU KNOW THEY HAVE A LOT OF DIFFERENT CALLED SPECIAL WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE WORK IN DIFFERENT STATES. AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE FUNDING TO SHOW THEM THAT IT'S REAL AND THEN ENGAGE WITH THEM TO DO IT- A LOT OF THE PARAMETERS WHICH HELP GUIDE OUR DECISIONS NOW. WHAT THEY DID LEGISLATION. WHAT'S RCGP INVESTMENT PLAN AS WELL AS WITH REALLY GREAT TOOLS WHICH WE HAVE. WITH AB TWENTY ONE TWENTY SEVEN AND SENATE BILL ONE THOUSAND. AND ALSO AB EIGHT HUNDRED FIVE. THE WHAT WE DO- ALL THE CLEAN VEHICLE- FUNDING PROGRAMS THAT WAY THE. SO THIS IS A NEIGHBOR JUST WITH THEIR RESOURCES BOARD I'LL JUST JUMP IN THAT THE PROCESS ON THE CURBSIDE IS VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT WAS DESCRIBED ON THE CDC SIDE WE TAKE OUR CUES FROM THE ANNUAL APPROPRIATIONS FROM THE LEGISLATURE. RAN THROUGH- BROAD BUCKETS OF FUNDING THAT WE OFTEN GET TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT SPECIFIC PROGRAMS SHOULD RECEIVE FUNDING AND WHETHER OR NOT WE SHOULD BE MAKING ANY KIND OF PROGRAM CHANGES- I UNDERTAND YOU WERE IN TRYING TO FIGURE OUT MAYBE SOME RULES OF THUMB EARLIER FOR HOW TO THINK ABOUT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET SO- WHAT YOU'LL SEE IN. THE GOVERNOR'S. BUDGET IS BASICALLY BINS OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF FUNDING LIKE EQUITY AND HEAVY DUTY BUT THEN INSIDE EACH OF THOSE BUCKETS OR ARE SPECIFIC PROGRAMS. AT LEAST FROM THE CAR PERSPECTIVE. SO IF YOU LOOK AT A PROGRAM LIKE CLEAN CARS FOR ALL. PRESCRIPTION REPLACE PROGRAM. ON AVERAGE- EIGHT AVERAGE INCENTIVE DOLLAR AMOUNT THAT IS ABOUT EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR FINANCING ASSISTANCE IT'S ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR GRANT PER VEHICLE. SO USING THESE AVERAGES MAYBE CAN HELP YOU BALLPARK YOU KNOW THINKING ABOUT THESE VARIOUS BUCKETS. I DON'T REALLY FEEL PARKS IN THIS COMMITTEE WE DO SPECIFIC NUMBERS SO WHAT'S THE SPECIFIC NUMBER. SURE WELL GIVEN. THE BALLPARK YOUR BUDGET WITHOUT BE HELPFUL. MAYBE LESS SO YES RIGHT RIGHT I AGREE. WITH THAT WE CAN BOTH AGREE ON THAT. SO I THINK THE THING THAT- WE'RE BOTH TRYING TO CONVEY IS THAT THERE'S A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT PROGRAMS THAT ARE BURIED IN THESE BUCKETS AND SO SHOULD THE LEGISLATURE MOVE FORWARD. WITH THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET AND FOR THOSE DIFFERENT BUCKETS WE WOULD THEN USE THE PUBLIC PROCESS OVER THE SUMMER TO REFINE THOSE ALLOCATIONS ON A PER PROGRAM- A PER PROGRAM AMOUNT FOR EACH OF THOSE BUCKETS. I WHICH WOULD THEN TAKE TO REPORT EVERY YEAR AT OCTOBER FOR A FINAL DECISION LEGISLATURE OF COURSE. YOU KNOW IT'S YOUR PREROGATIVE IF YOU IF YOU WOULD WANT TO PUT APPROPRIATE PER LINE ITEM THAT'S JUST NOT HOW THE EXISTING GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET DOES. IS SET UP. THE WAY YOU SEE IT TODAY. OKAY THANK I WANT TO ADD. JUST ONE POINT TWO IS WHAT CITY. WHAT CITY AN ANTENNA WERE SAYING TO. BUT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL- ALSO I DON'T. REALLY FOCUS ON ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. SO ONE OF THE I MEAN WE NEED TO BUILD THAT SEVEN CONSTRUCTION BECAUSE OF THE MAJOR BARRIER TO THAT THE PLANET BUT WE ALSO NEED. TO CREATE JOBS AND TO STIMULATE THE ECONOMY IN THIS TIME SO. THAT IS ANOTHER IMPORTANT BENEFIT OF THE GOVERNOR URGED FOCUS ON BUILDING OUT THEIR MISSION VEHICLE INFRASTRUCTURE. IS BECAUSE THESE ARE SHOVEL READY PROJECT WE HAVE. TEN WITH SAYING THE PROGRAM THE CALIFORNIA ELECTRIC VEHICLE INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT WHICH WE CAN DEFINE ONE IN THERE. AND WE CAN DEPLOY IT. CHARGERS VERY RAPIDLY. TO HELP CREATE GOOD JOBS. IN YOU KNOW IN AN INDUSTRY THAT WE KNOW WE'RE GOING TO NEED FOR THE FUTURE YOU KNOW YOU WANT THIS YEAR MISSION VEHICLE INDUSTRY. SUGGEST GROWING CRIED HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE WANT TO KEEP BEING THAT. SHE AND- GLOBALLY ON ZERO EMISSION TRANSPORTATION. AND SO YOU KNOW THE BIG INVESTMENT NOW SHOWED THE WORLD THAT WE'RE COMMITTED. AND WE'RE COMMITTED TO OVERCOMING WHAT IS. ONE OF THE BIGGEST BARRIERS AND I WAS AND STILL. THE BIGGEST BARRIER WHICH IS A LACK OF A CONVENIENCE. THAT INFRASTRUCTURE. IN OTHER AND I COMPLETELY WITH YOU BURKE COMMISSIONER I THINK THAT I THINK THE- IS. ON THE- ONLY WORKS IF YOU HAVE. TO FUEL. THE THIS POINT AS AS YOU KNOW SWITCHED HAVE UNDER A MILLION VEHICLES WERE WELL SHORT OF R. ONE POINT FIVE MILLION VEHICLE GOAL BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. WELL SHORT OF OUR FIVE MILLION VEHICLE GOAL BY TWENTY THIRTY. AND SO WHAT WE DON'T WANT IS TO HAVE- A LOT OF CHARGING STATIONS WITH NO VEHICLES CHARGING AT THE- I THINK THAT IS THE- THE- I THINK. THE MAJOR QUESTION BECAUSE THERE ISN'T- THERE'S NOTHING IN THE PROPOSAL THAT REALLY HELPS DRIVE AT THE OVERALL GOAL OF GETTING TO THE FIVE MILLION VEHICLES BY TWENTY THIRTY UNLESS IT'S THE ADMINISTRATION'S. VIEWPOINT THAT THE THAT WE'VE DONE ENOUGH IN THE MARKET WILL GET US TO FIVE MILLION VEHICLES BY TWENTY THIRD. I'LL TRY TO VOTE THE LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. FOR THE CHICKEN AND EGG PROBLEM SOUNDS AND I ACTUALLY WANT TO THANK YOU WITH EVERYTHING FOR AT LEADING THE CHARGE TO HUNT AB TWENTY ONE TWENTY SEVEN BECAUSE IT REALLY HAS BEEN A GREAT TOOL FOR US. IN TERMS OF ASSESSING WHERE THE MARKET IS AND WHERE IT'S GOING AND HOW DO WE MAKE SURE WE'RE WE'RE BEING STRATEGIC IN OUR STATE INVESTMENT- ATTACK AND I COMPLETELY AGREE I THINK I THINK YOU PUT TOGETHER A GREAT REPORT AND I WAS- IN ORDER TO. CARRY THAT BILL I THINK YOU'VE DONE A GREAT JOB IN IDENTIFYING THE INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS. BUT I THINK THAT INFRASTRUCTURE OBVIOUSLY. BUT INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS ARE BASED ON ASSUMPTIONS. OF GREATER ALECTRA VEHICLE ADOPTION. AND SO I GUESS IS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION'S POSITION THAT WE NO LONGER NEED TO- PROVIDE ANY INCENTIVE FOR. PASSENGER VEHICLES AND THAT NATURALLY THE MARKET WILL JUST. GET US TO WHERE WE NEED TO GO OUTSIDE OF. AGAIN THE EQUITY COMMUNITIES WHICH IS WHERE THE BUDGET HAS IDENTIFIED SOME NEEDS. RIGHT I DO THINK WE ARE SEEING TREMENDOUS PROGRESS GLOBALLY I MEAN THE QUESTION YOU ASK IS IT TIME TO TAKE THEIR HANDS OFF THE WHEEL WHEN IT COMES TO THE APPLIANCE AND IT IS A COMPLICATED ONE AT. THAT YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE NOT FAMILIAR WITH SUCH AS THE MARKET ACCELERATE AS WE GET MORE VEHICLE OPTIONS AT EVERY PRICE ITS FAULT. BUT NO MATTER WHAT. THE COMMITTEES. I'M SORRY I'M NOT APOLOGIZE FOR INTERRUPTING YOU BUT THE IT IS A COMPLICATED ONE. BUT YOU'VE ANSWERED IT IN YOUR BUDGET. PROPOSAL SO. IS THE BUDGET PROPOSAL REFLECTIVE OF YOU KNOW. YOU'RE THINKING WHICH IS THE LIKE AGAIN BUDGETS ARE STATEMENTS OF ALEX IN THIS BUDGET STATES THAT THEY'RE NO LONGER NEEDS TO BE INCENTIVES FOR PASSENGER. VEHICLES AB SIDE% OF CERTAIN LOWER INCOME COMMUNITIES. I THINK THAT THE THAT'S CORRECT THE FRAMING IS REALLY THAT WE NEED TO SUPPORT LOW INCOME FAMILIES MAKE SURE THAT THE TO THE TRANSITION THAT WORKS FOR EVERYONE- THAT WE NEED TO PRIORITIZE MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY VEHICLE INCENTIVES WHERE THE MARKET IS NASCENT BUT GROWING- AND THAT'S ACTUALLY WHERE I HAVE A LOT OF OPTIMISM THAT IF WE CAN JUST SET THE RIGHT. BUSINESS SIGNALED.% INDUSTRY ONE BASS BUT IT'S TOO EARLY WE NEED TO DO BRACKET- YOU'RE GOING TO SIGN. A NIGHT OF FUN I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT YOU HAVE ANSWERED MY QUESTION. WELL PLATE THAT I THINK THE AFTERMATH IN CENTER IS A IS A BET ABOUT STRUCTURE AND THE FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLAR CASH ON THE HOOD AND SEND IT THROUGH THE LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD I. THINK WE NEED TO GO BACK THE QUESTION THAT YOU RAISE NOT ALL AUTOMAKERS HAVE. HAS TAKEN IT THAT'S THAT'S NEW. FOR ME AND I DON'T KNOW SYDNEY IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD ON THAT. THE DESIGN OF THE LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLAR. CHECK ANOTHER INCENTIVE. IN TERMS OF THE OVERALL IT BUDGET STRUCTURE AND WHAT'S BEING PROPOSED THERE ARE I WOULD JUST SIMPLY PUT A TICKET TO MY COLLEAGUES AT DELOS- THERE ARE AS YOU'VE NOTED ON A NUMBER OF PROGRAMS THAT AREN'T NECESSARILY SET UP THE SAME WAY SEE EUROPEANS BUT IS INTENDED TO HELP INSURE THAT FOLKS ARE GETTING INTO. LOLOISH AND ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES. THE CARD FINANCING AND YES WE WOULD SAY THAT THAT DOWNTOWN PROPOSAL FOR. HELPING TRADE BETTER REFLECT THE PRIORITY ARE DENOTED OF PUBLIC HEALTH ESPECIALLY DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. AND THE PROPOSAL FOR YOU ALL TODAY COMPUTERS AND ALSO REALLY TRY TO PARKING STRUCTURE WITHIN. HE HAS. A BARRIER. TO THE BIGGER- ALECTRA VOEPEL IT IS OF A FACTOR PARTY AGAINST WITH YOU ARE CAP AND TRADE DOLLARS AND ON HOW CAN THREE. NO NO WE'RE WE'RE WITH THE THAT WHICH ON MAKE SURE THE THAT YOU KNOW WE HAVE NO. WE HAVE NO- DISK THAT WE DON'T WANT THE MONEY TO GO TO A LARGE COMMITTEES DO WE JUST WANNA MAKE SURE IT'S GETTING THERE A QUICK QUESTION REGARDING THE- PLUS UP SO THERE IS A LOW INCOME PLUS UP THROUGH C. V. R. P. WITH THE BRP GOING WHAT HAPPENS WITH THAT POPOFF UP FOR LOW INCOME FAMILIES WHO ARE. INTERESTED IN. FRANKLIN CARS. THERE ARE HAPPY HAPPY TO FILL IN THEIR ABILITIES CAPITA REPLACE PROGRAMON ITS OWN FOR A LOW INCOME PERCENT OFFERS NINETY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR SCRAPPING AND THEN REPLACING WITHOUT YOUR ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE- UNDER CURRENT CONDITIONS THAT IS A PROGRAM THAT IS STACKABLE WITH CVR PETE WITHOUT C. B. R. P. ON THAT PROGRAM THE STOCK'S CAPITAL BASED PROGRAM WOULD CONTINUE ALL ALONG THAT LOWER AMOUNT OF NINETY FIVE HUNDRED GODDESSES SO LOW INCOME FAMILIES WOULD LOSE THAT FORTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS. SO GOING BACK TO CLEAN CARS FOR ALL ON YOU CAN PURCHASE A NEW OR USED CONVENTIONAL GAS VEHICLES HYBRID PLUG IN ELECTRIC- BATTERY ELECTRIC SERVICE IS THERE A REASON WHY YOUR ARMY- SUBSIDIZING. ANYTHING BUT CLEAN CARS. IN THE CLEAN CARS FALL PROGRAM. ANYTHING I'M SORRY I'M NOT ACTUALLY CHECKING THE QUESTION IS THE QUESTION. IN THE CLEAN CARS FOR ALL PROGRAM SOMEONE CAN CAN GET RID OF THEIR OLD CAR BUY A NEW CAR BUT THERE'S A WIDE VARIETY OF NEW CARS THEY CAN BUY THEIR REASON. WHY THAT'S NOT RESTRICTED ONLY TO- CLEAN CARS. NEW CLEAN CARS. OR USE CLEAN CARS SURE SURE SO WITH THE STRUCTURE OF THE PROGRAM THE IDEA HERE IS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO OUTREACH AND PROVIDE AS MANY CLEAN OPTIONS TO LOW AND MODERATE INCOME CONSUMERS AS WE POSSIBLY CAN WITH THE GOAL OF COURSE OF CLEANING UP TRANSPORTATION BROKER THE ACCELERATION OF THROUGH THE RETIREMENT OF OLDER DIRTIER CARS BUT ALSO REPLACING WITH CLEANER CARS SO YOU'RE RIGHT THE PROGRAM DOES OFFER YOU KNOW A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT TYPES FROM FROM HYBRID TO PURE. JEFF YOUR ZERO MISSION WE- AS PART OF THE STRUCTURE THE PROGRAM BASED ON THE INPUT WE ARE GETTING THROUGH THE PUBLIC PROCESS WE DID NOT WANT TO DICTATE WHICH YOU KNOW OPTIONS WERE AVAILABLE TO PEOPLE WE UNDERSTAND THAT DIFFERENT HOUSEHOLDS HAVE DIFFERENT NEEDS WHEN IT COMES TO MOBILITY AND SO WE'RE TRYING TO STRIKE THAT BALANCE OF GETTING FOLKS INTO A CLEANER VEHICLE BUT HELPING THEM GET INTO A CLEANER VEHICLE THAT THAT MEETS THEIR TRANSPORTATION NEEDS. I THINK JUST COME BACK TO MY M. MCAULIFFE INVENTORS COMMENTS. PART PART THE REASON WHY I THINK THERE'S- THERE THERE'S NO SUPPORT. TO GIVE- CARB THE AUTHORITY- TO SPEND THE MONEY OVER TO YOUR PERRY WITHOUT SPECIFICALLY- LINE LINE ITEM- APPROPRIATING DIFFERENT PROGRAMS. IS BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S A FEELING INCLUDING ON BEHALF OF MYSELF. THAT THE AGENCY. LISTENS TO CERTAIN. STAKEHOLDERS BUT DOESN'T WITH INTO THE LEGISLATURE. I FOR ONE DO NOT FEEL THE AGENCIES VERY RESPONSIVE TO THE LEGISLATURE OF LEGISLATURES. IMPORT OR- YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT WE HAVE TO SAY. I THINK. HIS HIS EXAMPLE WAS ILLUSTRATIVE OF. THE TYPICAL CARBON ACTION WHICH IS CARP TELLS US WHAT THEY'RE GONNA DO. WE GIVE FEEDBACK AND THEN CARP CONTINUES TO DO WHAT THEY WERE GONNA DO. SO I REALLY DO HOPE WITH- NEW LEADERSHIP COMING IN THAT THERE WILL BE A CHANGE IN THAT RELATIONSHIP WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND THE PUBLIC. ARE BECAUSE WE DO HAVE SIGNIFICANT NEEDS AND WE DO HAVE- YOU KNOW VERY LOFTY GOALS THAT WE WANT TO ALL THE CHIEF AND WE'RE ALL VERY SUPPORTIVE OF. PUBLIC LAST QUESTION ON A FIT I KNOW THE- SHIFT FROM. PASSENGER VEHICLES TO HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES MEDIUM HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES. I JUST WANT TO UNDERSTAND WHY THAT TIME IS NOW TO MOVE IN THAT DIRECTION AND WHETHER. ON THE REALLY ARE MARKET OPTIONS OUTSIDE OF BUT I'M I'M WELL AWARE OF THE BUS MARKET BUT- OUTSIDE OF THAT IF THIS IS REALLY THE TIME TO MOVE IN THAT DIRECTION. SHARE WITH RESPECT TO THE OVERALL STATE OF THE ZERO EMISSION HEAVY DUTY MARKET NOW IS REALLY A VERY EXCITING TIME. THERE'S OVER A HUNDRED MODELS OF ZERO EMISSION TRUCKS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO BE SOLD TODAY AND OVER SIX MAJOR OEMS. THAT ARE PRODUCING IN THE HEAVY DUTY CLASS EIGHT SPACE RIGHT NOW. THERE ARE SEVERAL THINGS ON THE HORIZON- TO HELP THEM CONTINUE CALIFORNIA'S LEADERSHIP MODEL WHEN IT COMES TO. IN MANUFACTURING AND THE PURCHASE OF THESE ZERO EMISSION% TRUCKS- ONE OF THE ADVANCE CLEAN TRUCKS REGULATION AND THIS WILL FEES AND STARTING IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. WHICH WILL REQUIRE MANUFACTURERS TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY ARE SELLING. CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT INCREASING NUMBERS OF ZERO EMISSION TRUCKS TO MARKET. AND THAT THAT REDUCE REQUIREMENTS RANGE ALL THE WAY FROM CLASS TO BE ALL THE WAY UP TO CLASS EIGHT. THE H. BUT PROGRAM WHICH HAS BEEN DISCUSSED A LITTLE BIT TODAY. OFFICERS AS ANY WILL SERVE AS A COMPLEMENT TO THAT- REQUIREMENT WHICH WILL HELP TO IMMERSE. IT INTO AND MAKE THIS PURCHASE DECISIONS FOR THOSE-ZERO EMISSION TRUCKS SO- THE FUTURE REALLY IS NOW WHEN IT COMES TO ZERO EMISSION TRUCKING. GREAT THANK YOU SO MUCH TO JUST JUST TO REITERATE I REALLY DO HOPE THAT THE AGENCY WILL BECOME AGAIN MORE RESPONSIVE TO. I THINK THE LEGISLATURE AND FRANKLY THE PUBLIC'S INPUT I THINK IT'S BEEN. LACKING UNFORTUNATELY IN THE PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT. AND IT I DO LOOKED FORWARD TO THE FOLLOW UP FROM THE ADMINISTRATION TO GET GREATER DETAIL ABOUT WHERE THIS. IS GOING. BUT I WOULD JUST SAY I CAN'T SUPPORT. D. THREE POINT THIRTY THREE TO FIFTEEN MILLION OVER TWO YEARS FOR HEAVY VEHICLES IN THE HUNDRED. FIFTY MILLION OVER TWO YEARS FOR THE TRANSPORTATION EQUITY PROGRAMS WITHOUT- LINE BY LINE DETAIL. ABOUT WHERE THE MONEY IS GOING. THANK YOU. MISS FRIEDMAN DID YOU OF ALL OF A TO FOLLOW UP AND NOT TO GET TOO DEEP INTO THE WOODS BUT I AM WONDERING WITH THE EQUITY PROGRAM AND- MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FRANCISCO BROUGHT UP THAT THE LAST THING WE WANT IS TO SPEND A LOT OF MONEY ON CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE AND HAVE NO WHEN YOU SAID I'M WONDERING IF THE PROGRAM IS DESIGNED IN SUCH A WAY TO LOOK AT THOSE CHARGERS AS THE ROLLING OUT TO SEE WHETHER THEY ARE ACTUALLY BEING. UTILIZED BECAUSE THERE ARE A LOT OF BARRIERS OUTSIDE OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE- IN PARTICULARLY IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES TO PURCHASING AND OPERATING VEHICLES AND IT MIGHT EVEN BE JUST- PEOPLE'S IMPRESSIONS YOU KNOW COULD BE A BARRIER THERE'S ALL KINDS OF THINGS THAT COULD STOP PEOPLE FROM BEING EARLY ADOPTERS OF THIS TECHNOLOGY SO IS A PROGRAM DESIGNED TO EVALUATE IS IT GOES ALONG WITH THE- THE CHARGES ARE ACTUALLY BEING USED AND HOW THEY'RE BEING USED AND BY WHOM. AND TO PIVOT. IF NEED BE. ARE THEY AT. THE START AND THEN AND THEN IF YOU WANT TO- EMBELLISH AT ALL. SO AT RIGHT NOW YOU KNOW WE DON'T HAVE. THE BIG DATA ON HOW MANY. PEOPLE ARE USING THE CHARGERS AND YOU KNOW WHAT HOW LONG ARE USING THEM FOR BUT ACTUALLY PLANNING TO DO A PILOT PROJECT TO EVALUATE THAT BECAUSE IT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT QUESTION- SIX. ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WE FACE IS PACKED WE GET AS I SAID WE HAVE A CHICKEN EGG PROBLEM SO WE WANT TO HAVE THE CHARGERS OUT. BEFORE THEY'RE BEING USED. AND WE KNOW THAT. THE CHARGING MARKET ISN'T CURRENTLY SELF SUSTAINING. YOU KNOW THEY'RE NOT MAKING MONEY- AND WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS. IS STAGGER THE INVESTMENT SO THAT WE GET- THE CHARGERS OUT THERE BEFORE. THEY ARE AND YEARS THAT INFRASTRUCTURE OUT THERE BEFORE IT'S NEEDED. THEN AS THE MARKET STARTS TO TAKE OFF AND WE'LL SEE. GREATER UTILIZATION OF EACH CHARGER. THEN THE AMOUNT THAT WE'RE GONNA FUNDS PER CHARGE WILL GO DOWN I MEAN OUR GOAL IS TO THEIR OUT MOST INVESTMENT OVER OVER YOU KNOW CHIMED. IN IT IN A KIND OF. LOGICAL TRANSPARENT WAY FOR THE MARKET ISN'T. FOR HERKY JERKY BUT THEY SEE THAT THE HORIZON. AND THEY'RE MAKING INVESTMENTS TO TAKE TO GET THERE. I THINK ON THE TRADING SIDE WE MAY ALWAYS NEED SOME CHARGERS. THAT ARE. ARE FUNDED BY THE STATE IN PLACES WHERE THE INSURGENTS WILL GO TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS. SEVEN FOR STRUCTURE THAT WORKS FOR EVERYBODY YEAH I THOUGHT I JUST HIGHLY YOU KNOW I THINK WE REALLY NEED TO BUILD THIS PROGRAM IN SUCH A WAY THAT YOU DO HAVE. A LOT OF EVALUATION ON THE GROUND BECAUSE YOU KNOW I'VE HEARD JUST ANECDOTALLY THAT FOR INSTANCE. EVEN IN MULTI FAMILY BUILDINGS THAT HAVE CHARGING STATIONS. THE LANDLORDS WANT TO CHARGE RESIDENTS TO USE THEM BECAUSE OF THE COST OF THE ELECTRICITY WHICH RIGHT NOW IS NOT BORNE BY THE INDIVIDUAL- TENANTS. SO YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THAT CAN HAPPEN ON THE GROUND THAT REALLY. BECOME HUGE BARRIERS SO JUST HAVING A CHARGER IN A LOCATION. REALLY DOESN'T GIVE US ANY DATA AT ALL ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT LIKE YOU SAID TO BE UTILIZED AND HOW AND BY WHOM. SO PUTTING A CHARGER FOR INSTANCE IN A MULTI FAMILY BUILDING AND THEN FINDING OUT IT'S ONLY BEING USED BY THE BUILDING OWNER WHEN THEY VISIT THE BUILDING. AND NOT THE TENANTS IS NOT THE INTENTION EITHER. SO I THINK THIS PROGRAM HAS TO HAVE EXTREMELY STRONG- OVERSIGHT AND METRICS AND GUARDRAILS BECAUSE IT'S A LOT OF MONEY THAT. WILL BE PUT UP. AND A GREAT INTENTIONS BUT IT WOULD BE AWFUL TO FIND OUT. LATER THAT THE MONEY WAS SPENT AND IT'S NOT HELP. THE CA. THAT IT'S INTENDED TO HELP. SO I WOULD TO SEE AT SOME POINT DETAILS ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO. EVALUATE THE CHARGERS AND THE INVESTMENT THAT WE'RE MAKING. THANKS SO MUCH. I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT QUESTION APPRECIATE THE PARTNERSHIP WITH THE LEGISLATURE INSURANCE TO FIGURE OUT HOW DO WE DO THIS IN A WAY THAT IS BEST FOR THE PUBLIC DOLLARS BACK FOR THE MARKET AND THAT'S FOR AN EQUITABLE SOLUTION FOR CALIFORNIA. YES I CERTAINLY AGREE AND- I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WERE SUFFERING FROM HERE AT TODAY IF IT HASN'T. BEEN EVIDENT. AS OF A LACKOF ANALYSIS SHOWING. THAT THE PROPOSALS THAT ARE BEING MADE- SUPPORT THE GOALS THAT THAT THAT THAT WE ALL SHARE. AND SO MORE INFORMATION- DEMONSTRATING THAT WOULD BE- VERY VERY WELCOME AS WE- HAVE CONTINUED TO ANALYZE. THE BUDGET PROPOSALS THAT ARE MADE STEP BY A YEAR AGENCIES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE PRESENTATIONS WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER SEVEN THAT'S THE- UNSPENT TO- FUNDING FROM THE CALIFORNIA SOLAR INITIATIVE. GOOD MORNING CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I M NATALIE LEE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE RENEWABLE ENERGY DIVISION AT THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION I HAVE A BRIEF REMARKS FOR THE COMMITTEE ON THIS ITEM. I REQUEST FUNDING PREVIOUSLY ENCUMBERED UNDER THE NEW SOLAR HOMES PARTNERSHIP OR AN S. H. P. PROGRAM. TO BE RE APPROPRIATED FOR NEW PURPOSES PROPOSED BY ADVOCATE. I'D LIKE TO FIRST ADDRESS THE SOURCING AVAILABILITY OF THE FUNDS IDENTIFIED FOR REALLOCATION. THE N. S. H. P. PROGRAM ADMINISTERED BYTHE ENERGY COMMISSION IS PART OF THE HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL CALIFORNIA SOLAR INITIATIVE WHICH LAUNCHED IN JANUARY OF TWO THOUSAND SEVEN. AND IS NOW NEARING COMPLETION. THE N. S. H. P. PROGRAM PROVIDES INCENTIVES FOR THE INTEGRATION OF SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEMS THE NEW HOMES. THE PROGRAM IS NO LONGER APPROVING NEW PARTICIPATION. BUT WILL CONTINUE TO COMPLETE PAYMENT OF CLAIMS THROUGH DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST OF THIS YEAR. A SEVENTY TWO POINT OH THREE MILLION DOLLARS BEING REQUESTED FOR REALLOCATION. OUR MONEY IS PROVIDED TO THE M. S. H. P. PROGRAM FROM THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES. ENCUMBERED THROUGH PROJECT PRESERVATION. PRIOR TO THE INCUMBENTS DEADLINE WHICH WAS JUNE FIRST OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. ALTHOUGH RESERVATIONS IDENTIFIED THE FUNDS WOULD BE NEEDED FOR APPROVED PROJECTS. DUE TO A NUMBER OF FACTORS PAYMENT CLAIMS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE PROJECTS HAVE SUBSTANTIALLY DECLINED. AND FIFTY STAFF NOW ANTICIPATE THAT THEY ANTICIPATE THAT THE IDENTIFIED FUNDS. WILL REMAIN UNSPENT BY THE DISBURSEMENT DEADLINE WHICH AGAIN IS DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THE PROPOSED REALLOCATION WOULD ALLOW THE FUNDS TO BE USED TO ADDRESS ADDITIONAL NEEDS PROPOSED BY ADVOCATES INTO A NEW PROGRAM. IN I. O. U. TERRITORY. AS WE UNDERSTAND THE OTHER KIDS PROPOSAL THE FIRST PROGRAM WHICH WOULD RECEIVE 72% OF THE FUNDS WOULD PROVIDE INCENTIVES FOR GREEN SMART NEW HOMES. INCLUDING EITHER COMES BUILT WITH SOLAR AND STORAGE. OR ALTERNATIVELY AN ALL ELECTRIC HOME BUILT WITH SOLAR AND AT LEAST ONE GREAT RESPONSIVE TECHNOLOGIES. THE SECOND PROPOSED PROGRAM RECEIVING 28% OF THE FUND. WOULD PROVIDE EDUCATION GRANTS AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. EFFORTS TO ADOPT AUTOMATED SOLAR AND STORAGE PERMITTING SYSTEM. IMPLEMENT REMOTE INSPECTION AND UNDERTAKE OTHER EX AND OTHER EXPENDITURES THAT SUPPORT THE REDUCTION OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS FROM HOMES. BUILDING ON A STRONG HISTORY OF SUCCESSFUL INCENTIVE AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM ADMINISTRATION. THE ENERGY COMMISSION IS WELL POSITIONED TO IMPLEMENT THE PROGRAMS THAT PROPOSED. AND WOULD BE INEFFICIENT ADMINISTRATOR FOR THESE NEW PROGRAMS SHOULD THE FUNDING ALLOCATION BE APPROVED. IT'S COMPLETE BY REMARKS AND I'M HAPPY TO ADDRESS ANY QUESTIONS. L. A. R. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. MISTER CHIRAC BROWN WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE THIS IS IN A PROPOSAL THAT WE HAVE FIVE SPENT MUCH TIME ANALYZING BUT WE'RE HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU AND YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF IF IT'S AN ISSUE THAT THAT THE LEGISLATURE WOULD LIKE TO EXPLORE GOING FORWARD. THANK YOU A FINANCE SIDE ASSUME IS PROBABLY NOT A REPORT. CORRECT HI THANK YOU WE HAVEN'T SEEN INTO A POSITION AT THIS TIME SO- IF I UNDERSTAND IT CORRECTLY- THERE IS AN INTEREST IN DISCUSSING THIS THERE SIR THERE'S- NO COMMITMENT TO- AGREEMENT- AND THE SO I WOULD JUST LIKE TO REITERATE WE CAN'T TAKE AN ACTION ON THIS TODAY BUT I'D LIKE TO REITERATE THAT- WE HAVE AN INTEREST IN- EVERYONE WORKING TOGETHER WITH THE ADVOCATES TO SEE IF THERE'S SOMETHING HERE THAT COULD BE FLUSHED OUT. THAT'S WORKABLE TO USE THE CELL SEVENTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN UNSPENT FUNDS. AND I THINK UP A WITH THAT WE CAN NOW MOVE ON. TO OUR NEXT ISSUE WHICH WILL BE. ISSUE NINE IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN- LOCAL STREETS AND ROADS TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE I THINK WE'LL BE ABLE TO MOVE THROUGH THE REST OF OUR AGENDA RELATIVELY QUICKLY NOW. THANK HEAR. FOR GOOD AFTERNOON. CHAIR BLOOMING MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME TODAY I AM PLEASED TO TAYLOR CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION. AS BRIEF BACKGROUND THE COMMISSION ISN'T INDEPENDENT STATE AGENCY RESPONSIBLE FOR ALLOCATING FUNDS TO TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS WE HAVE TWELVE COMMISSIONERS AND TWO NON VOTING LEGISLATIVE EXHIBITION COMMISSIONERS ONE OF WHICH IS ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRIEDMAN IT'S GOOD TO SEE IT SAYING WE HOPE YOU CAN JOIN US. AT OUR MEETING NEXT WEEK. LET'S NOT THE COMMISSION IS. TRAILER LANGUAGE TO ADDRESS THE MAINTENANCE OF EFFORT REQUIREMENT IN THE LOCAL STREETS AND ROADS PROGRAM TO RECOGNIZE THE IMPACTS THAT THE COPING NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS HAD ON CITY AND COUNTY GENERAL FUNDS. AS BACKGROUND THE LOCAL STREETS AROUND PROGRAM STATUS BY SB ONE THE ROAD REPAIR AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN. PROVIDES APPROXIMATELY ONE POINT ONE BILLION ANNUALLY TO CITIES AND COUNTIES FOR BASIC ROAD MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR REYES STATUTORY FORMULA. ONE OF THE REQUIREMENTS FOR CITIES AND COUNTIES TO RECEIVE FUNDING IS TO MAINTAIN THEIR GENERAL FUND SPENDING A LOCAL STREETS AND ROADS TO AT LEAST THE AVERAGE THEY SPEND DURING THE FISCAL YEAR NINE TEN. TEN ELEVEN ELEVEN TWELVE SCHOOL YEARS. AT THE START OF THE PANDEMIC IN MARCH TWENTY TWENTY THE COMMISSION BEGAN RECEIVING FEEDBACK FROM CITIES AND COUNTIES REGARDING THEIR POTENTIAL AND ABILITY TO MEET THE MAINTENANCE OF EFFORT REQUIREMENTS. BECAUSE THEIR GENERAL FUND REVENUES WERE DECLINING AND THEY NEEDED TO DEDICATE RENT. RESOURCES TO ADDRESSING. THE NINETEEN IMPACTS IN THE MONTH AFTERWARD COMMISSION STAFF THE FACILITATED NUMEROUS MEETINGS WITH THE WORKGROUP CONSISTING OF STAKEHOLDERS AND INDUSTRY GROUPS TO DISCUSS THE EFFORT. CONCLUDED THAT SUSPENDING THE MAINTENANCE OF EFFORT REQUIREMENT FOR THE NINETEEN TWENTY FISCAL YEAR WAS APPROPRIATE SINCE THE PANDEMIC BEGAN SUDDENLY AND LEGISLATOR. WAS ALREADY OVER. FURTHER INCLUDING THAT FOR THE TWELVE TWENTY AND ONE TWENTY TWO FISCAL YEARS THAT MAKE THEM SO THAT REQUIREMENTS SHOULD BE ADJUSTED EACH. AND PROPORTION THE LAS ACCIONES BRAND SIX. THIS APPROACH THAT CITIES AND COUNTIES DO NOT LOSE CRITICAL STATE FUNDS FOR THEIR ROADS THROUGH NO TURNED AROUND. WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AS WE PREACH THAT FINDING A GENDER. THANK YOU L. A. O. OR- AND- DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. WARNING MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK MINUTES WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- THE PROPOSAL RAISED NO CONCERNS FOR OFFICE WE FIND IT REASONABLE TO PROVIDE MAINTENANCE AFTER- REDUCTIONS FOR CITIES AND COUNTIES THAT HAVE SEEN REVENUE LOSSES DUE TO THE PANDEMIC. THANK YOU CHAIR AND COMMITTEE- STEVE WELLS THE DEPARTMENTOF FINANCE- WE AGREE THAT THIS- THIS LANGUAGE IS NECESSARY TO PROVIDE TEMPORARY RELIEF TO LOCAL AGENCIES THAT ARE EXPERIENCING A DISPROPORTIONATE FISCAL ISSUES DURING A PANDEMIC- WE ALL THINK THIS LINE WOULD ALLOW THEM TO CONTINUE TO DELIVER SB ONE PROJECTS. AND SB ONE MAINTENANCE WITHOUT INTERRUPTION. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU APPRECIATE THE REPORTS IF THERE'S NO QUESTIONS WILL MOVE ON TO ISSUE TEN NOT SAYING ANY QUESTION SO LET SILVA- MOVE ON TO TEN THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND WE HAVE- OF THIS- ITEM ALSO IS THE TRANSPORTATION AGENCY. THIS IS THE- TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE WHAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND CHAIRMAN BLOOM AND ASSEMBLY MEMBERS. THE RESPONSE OF COMMONSENSE ADDISON CHIEF DEPUTY SECRETARY OF BALANCE THAT'S IT. IF THREE. EXCEPT ABOUT THIS A BILL LANGUAGE THAT. YOU KEEP BOTH A PERSPECTIVE ALL IT STANDS OF THE IT REALLY RELIEF MEASURES CONTAINED IN BOSTON IF NINETY IN EIGHTY OF SEVEN FOR ONE OCCASION PIECE YEAR APPARENTLY WAITING PENALTIES THAT ARE OF TO BE ALLOCATED BOND FOR TO ACHIEVE CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO OFFERING BECAUSE IN RECOVERING. SECOND BILL REQUIRES THAT A PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION PROVIDER REPORTS BY. IDENTIFYING HOW. TO STREAMLINE THAT THEY SUBMIT REQUIRED TO PROVIDE. WITH REPORTING PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT REQUIREMENTS. THIRD THE BILL SPECIFICALLY SIMPLIFIES ALEX DEBILITY TASKS RELATED TO AGENCIES SPENDING STATE FUNDING OPERATIONS FOR THOSE AGENCIES TO PROVIDE LOCAL FUNDING LEVELS AT OR ABOVE THOSE PROVIDED IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. THIS OPENS THE DOOR TO MORE FUNDING CERTAINTY AND FLEXIBILITY IN HOW TO PROVIDE SERVICE TO ALL PARTS NEED TO BE SORT OF A TRANSIT OPERATOR. IN ADDITION COURAGE BY THIS PROVISION MAY NOT HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE UNDER CURRENT DRAWBACKS RECOVERY REQUIREMENTS. THE OUTCOMES OF THESE PROVISIONS WILL BE EVALUATED FOR EFFECTIVENESS AFTER FIVE YEARS. FINALLY THE BILL EXCLUDES WITH THE CALCULATION OF FAREBOX RECOVERY AND HAPPENING COST PER HOUR. ACOSTA REQUIRING MANDATED AMERICANS WITH DISABILITY ACT SERVICE THE PROVISIONS OF THE SERVICES DID NOT DOES NOT NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE FIXED ROUTE BUS SERVICE. EXTRA SERVICES. IT ALSO EXCLUDES MISCALCULATIONS THE COST OF FLEXIBLE ROUTE SERVICES SO THAT THERE IS MORE OF A LIKE A CANDIDATE IN THE EXPANSION OF SERVICE INTO NEW AREAS OF THE COMMUNITY. I CANNOT SUPPORT A FULL FIXED ROUTE BUS SERVICE. IN SUMMARY THIS BILL REDUCES THE REQUIREMENTS THAT NEED TO BE MAPPED FOR LOCAL TRANSIT AGENCIES TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS ALL OF THEIR FORMULA BASED FUNDING. BY HAVING MORE CERTAINTY THAT FUNDS CAN BE SPENT ON OPERATIONS IN THE COMING YEARS AGENCIES WILL BE ABLE TO COMMIT TO FUNDING CHOICES. THAT WILL REDUCE THE PRESSURE TO FELLOW WORKERS AND REDUCE SERVICES. AND ALSO PROGRESSIVE INNOVATIVE WAYS OF SERVING OUR ENTIRE COMMUNITY WITH LOTS OF ALL SERVICE TYPE FOR FIXED BROADBAND SERVICE. IS NOT EFFECTIVE OR EFFICIENT THAT SUMMARY. I'D BE GLAD TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU L. L. ANY. THANK YOU CHAIR- WE DO NOT HAVE CONCERNS WITH THIS PROPOSAL THE LANGUAGE SEEMS CONSISTENT WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ACTION TAKEN LAST YEAR- ADS COMMITTEE STAFF NOTED AN AGENDA SOME OF THE REGULATORY RELIEF THAT'S EXTEND FOR SEVERAL YEARS SO THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD CONSIDER WHETHER SUCH DURATION OF REGULATORY RELIEF ALLIANCE AND WHAT THE IMPACTS IN RECOVERY AFTER TRANSIT AGENCIES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. I'LL BE CLEAR THAT THIS PROPOSALS PRUDENT AND- NECESSARY I WILL DRESS THE CURRENT CONVICTED MOBILE OUT FOR A- AND ADJUSTMENTS STORY THAT ARE LIKELY TO OCCUR POST THIS AMERICAN GRANT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY QUESTIONS SEEING NONE. PER SHARE THE REPORT WE WILL MOVE ON TO THE- THIRD ISSUE WITH- DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION ISSUE ELEVEN A HAZARDOUS MATERIAL REMOVAL AT AND CAMP MONTHS. GOOD MORNING CARE COLOGNE AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- MY NAME IS STEVEN CHECK I'M THE CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION. BETTER KNOWN TO MOST FOLKS IF CALTRANS FROM OUR REQUEST TODAY ON THIS ITEM IS FOR TWENTY POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN OPERATING EXPENSES FIND THIS MATERIAL REMOVAL CONTRACTS. CALTRANS ROLE USE THESE CONTRACT RESOURCES AT ENCAMPMENTS TO AID IN THE STATE REMOVAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS WITHIN THE STATE RIGHT OF WAY- AND THIS OCCURS PARTICULARLY AND HEAVY HEAVILY. POPULATED URBAN AREAS- ENCAMPMENTS POSE QUITE SIGNIFICANT HEALTH AND SAFETY RISKS TO CALTRANS EMPLOYEE EASE TO OUR CONTRACTORS OPERATING WITHIN THE RIGHT AWAY AND ALSO TO THE TRAVELING UP. SO REALLY THESE RESOURCES WOULD BE USED ALONG SIDE OF OUR OWN CREWS TO GO OUT TO CLEAN UP ENCAMPMENTS AND THEY WOULD BE REMOVING HAZARDOUS MATERIALS- AND DISPOSING OF IT IN A SAFE AND LEGAL WAY- THESE CONTRACTORS IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT HAVE. THE APPROPRIATE TRAINING OF LICENSING- AND THE ABILITY TO DO WHAT FRANKLY THE DEPARTMENT CANNOT DO WHICH IS TO DEAL WITH THE- MATERIALS APPROPRIATELY- I RECOGNIZE THAT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE HAS- RECOMMENDED THAT WARRANTED REQUEST. GRAHAM PERHAPS A DAY WHEN WE NO LONGER NEED THESE RESOURCES AND THE HOMELESS ISSUE- IS LESS PROMINENT IN WHAT WHERE DO. NECK INCLUDES BY PRESENTATION ON THIS. THANK YOU LMAO I THINK PART OF YOUR REPORT WAS JUST MADE. YES SO- INCREASING NUMBER OF THAT CUSTOMER SERVICE REQUEST AS WELL AS GROWING EXPENDITURES INDICATES THAT THAT NEED FOR HAZARDOUS MATERIAL REMOVAL HAS RISEN SIGNIFICANTLY OVER THE PAST- SEVERAL YEARS RESULTING IN THE ADDITIONAL WORKLOAD AND THAT MR CACAS AND INDICATED HOWEVER THE ESTIMATE OF THE ANNUAL COST OF THAT HAZARDOUS MATERIAL REMOVAL IS BASED ON THE EXPENDITURES OF ABOUT TWENTY WEEKS OF CONTRACT SERVICES FROM- NOVEMBER TWENTY NINETEEN TWO FEBRUARY TWENTY TWENTY. I AM IN DEPARTMENT USED EXPENDITURE RATE FROM A LIMITED PERIOD OF TIME BECAUSE THE PANDEMIC HAS LIMITED CLEAN UP ACTIVITY AT IN THE MONTHS FOLLOWING FEBRUARY TWENTY TWENTY AND SO HOWEVER INCOMPLETE- ANNUAL EXPENDITURE DATA MIGHT IN ACCURATELY CAPTURE THE COST OF SERVICES FOR THE ENTIRE YEAR SO FOR EXAMPLE AN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN THE LAST YEAR FOR WHICH WE HAVE COMPLETE ANNUAL DATA HOW TRANSPLANT ABOUT FOURTEEN POINT NINE MILLION ON IN CAMEROON FALL WHICH IS STILL LESS THAN THE AMOUNT REQUESTED IN THE PROPOSAL BY SEVERAL MILLIONS OF DOLLARS SANTA FE RENDON CERTAINTY AROUND THE ON GOING COSTS OF HAZARDOUS MATERIAL REMOVAL WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED- TWO YEAR LIMITED TERM FUNDING. FOR THANK YOU FIND. BENJAMIN PAUL PARTMINER FINANCE- I WOULD ECHO THE MADE WE DO SEE THE RESOURCE THE NEEDED FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE- BUT WE CAN DEFINITELY WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT TO MONITOR EXPENDITURE LEVELS AND DISCUSS IN TWO YEARS. THANK YOU- I WOULD LIKE TO REITERATE. THAT THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IT'S CERTAINLY AN ISSUE IN MY DISTRICT WHERE I GET CALLS ON A FAIRLY REGULAR BASIS- FOR HELP AND- SOMETIMES IT TAKES A LONG LONG TIME BEFORE THAT HEALTH IS HELP IS. FORTHCOMING SO I SINCERELY HOPE THAT THIS FUNDING HELPS ADDRESS THAT- SPECIFIC ISSUE WHICH SHOT UNFORTUNATELY I THINK IS GOING TO BE WITH US FOR LONGER THAN TWO YEARS- BUT- THAT SAID THAT THAT JUST POINTS OUT THAT THERE'S- SO MUCH MORE WORK TO BE DONE ON THE ISSUE OF- ADDRESSING- OF PEOPLE WHO ARE EXPERIENCING. HOMELESSNESS WITH THAT- A COMMENT FROM MEMBERS RIVAS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- YOU KNOW IN MY DISTRICT TO IN THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY OF LOS ANGELES- THIS IS ONE OF THE MAJOR ISSUES AND ONE OF THE NUMBER ONE REASONS I GET CALLS IN MY DISTRICT OFFICE- THEY ARE YOU KNOW CONSTITUENTS- WORKING TO. OUR IRAQ SUBMIT A CUSTOMER SERVICE REQUEST ABOUT- YOU KNOW THESE HAZARDOUS MATERIAL ALONG OUR HIGHWAYS IN THE DISTRICT OF AND SO MY QUESTION AND YOU KNOW I'VE I'VE HAD A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS WITH CALTRANS DISTRICT SEVEN- AND OTHERS HERE IN SACRAMENTO AND A LOT OF TIMES I HEAR WHAT WE DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES- TO CLEAN UP THESE AREAS- SO WHAT DOES THIS TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS COVER IS THIS. FOR THE CURRENT- CSR REQUEST THAT YOU MENTION THAT- YOU HAVE SEVENTY FOUR HUNDRED I'M I'M JUST NOT CLEAR IF THESE ARE OPEN REQUESTS OR THAT'S JUST HOW MANY RECEIVED IN THAT. YEAR. THANK YOU A MEMBER OF THIS SO THE- THE SHORT ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION THE SEVENTY FOUR HUNDRED IS AN ANNUAL NUMBER HOW MANY SERVICE REQUESTS RECEIVED ABOUT HOMELESS ENCAMPMENTS. WHAT THIS SPECIFIC FUNDING DOES IT ALLOWS US TO FULLY FIND ANY HAZARDOUS WASTE REMOVAL THAT WE NEED DONE. ARE AND WHAT WE HAVE DONE UP UNTIL THIS POINT IS HAD TO RE DIRECT OUR OWN- OTHER RESOURCES WITHIN THE MAINTENANCE PROGRAM YOU HAD TO RE DIRECTED TOWARDS HAZMAT REMOVAL. SO WHAT WITH THIS NEW RESOURCE WE WILL NO LONGER HAVE TO DO THAT AND WE CAN BRING THOSE RESOURCES BACK TO THE BASICS OF- ENCAMPMENT CLEAN UP THE WORK THAT OUR EMPLOYEES GENERALLY DO. SO REALLY THIS WILL PROVIDE THOSE HAS MET SERVICES AND ALLOW US TO RE DIRECTOR FUNDING BACK TOWARDS OF THE WORK THAT WE DO WITH IT WITH THE CAP. OKAY WHY HOPE THEN THAT I WILL HEAR THAT- FROM MY LOCAL CALTRANS MAINTENANCE. THAT THEY DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES YOU KNOW ONCE WE APPROVE THIS FUNDING- BECAUSE THAT'S BEEN THE BIGGEST ISSUE AND- YOU KNOW THEY HAVE. RESPONDED TO ME THAT THEY DON'T FEEL LIKE THEY'RE IN THE BUSINESS. OF CLEANING UP- THESE- HAZARDOUS MATERIAL ALONG OUR HIGHWAYS. AND SO THIS IS WHAT THEN I WILL BE EXPECTING IS WE HAVE PROVIDED ADDITIONAL RESOURCES- SO THEREFORE OURS. CS OURS SHOULD BE RESPONDED TO IN A- IN A TIMELY MANNER. THANK YOU. THANK YOU I DO WANT TO BE SURE THAT- THAT THE SPENDING IS GOING TO BE EQUITABLY AVAILABLE THROUGHOUT THE- THE STATE- NOT JUST IN CERTAIN AREAS OF THE STATE CAN YOU. ASSURE US OF THAT. CERTAINLY YEAH CARE BERMAN THIS RESOURCE WILL BE- DISTRIBUTED ACROSS THE STATE IN EVERY DISTRICT- IT WILL NOT BE DISTRIBUTED EVENLY ACROSS DISTRICTS OF COURSE BECAUSE THE NEED IS NOT THE SAME. BUT WE WILL- DISTRIBUTE THE FUNDING IN IN ALL AREAS OF THE STATE OR HAZARDOUS WASTE MATERIAL REMOVAL WHERE IT IS NECESSARY- WE ENVISION- TO NEW HAZMAT CONTRACTS FOR EACH DISTRICTS TO ALLOW US TO MEET THE DEMANDS- AS UP. AT US STRIKES ME THAT THERE'S- PROBABLY- A BACKLOG OF- OF REQUESTS IN THIS REGARD SO- THIS FUNDING IS INTENDED TO HELP CLEAR UP THE BACKLOG OR JUST KIND OF A YOU KNOW- MAINTAIN A BASIC LEVEL OF SERVICE. ORGANICALLY THANK. THAT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION SO THE REQUEST IS BASED ON AS WITH GEN BY THE LEGISLATIVE BASED ON A PRE CODED PERIOD THAT WE HAD FROM THE TIME WHEN WE STARTED USING HAS MATT CONTRACTS TO DEAL WITH THIS ISSUE- AND WIN THE COVETED ENDEMIC STARTED IN FEBRUARY OF LAST YEAR. SO- WILL NOT BE A BIG BACKLOG WHEN WE GET BACK INTO. THE CAMPS IN AND BEGIN THIS WORK MORE IN EARNEST AFTER THE AFTER THE PANDEMIC THERE THERE MAY BE. BUT THE REQUEST ITSELF IS BASED ON. AS WAS MENTIONED THE LIMITED DATA THAT WE HAD FROM BEFORE THE KOBE PERIOD. SO IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN HOW MUCH OF A BACKLOG AND WHAT WHAT CHALLENGES WE WILL FACE AGAIN ANOTHER- ANOTHER BANDIT. IT LIMITED TERM APPROPRIATIONS THAT WILL HAVE A CHANCE TO REASSESS THAT- AT THE END OF THE TWO YEAR PERIOD WELL A TH WAITING TWO YEARS TO FIGURE THIS OUT AS AS- NOT WERE. FRANKLY ACCEPTABLE AT IN MY VIEW THERE MUST BE A WAY- F. AM I UNDERSTANDING CORRECTLY THAT THE WORK ON. THE WORK THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WILL NOT COMMENCE UNTIL- EIGHT. CERTAIN MATRIKAS MAN MATT WITH RESPECT TO THE PANDEMIC. NO SIR WHAT I WAS TRYING TO INDICATE IS THAT WE HAVE IN AND MANY ARE- AREAS CURTAILED- THE NUMBER OF CAMPS THAT WE'RE ABLE TO CLEAR BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC FOR THE SAFETY OF OUR OWN CREWS AND FOR A BI- ALMOST INDIVIDUALS THAT LIVE THERE SO YOU MUST HAVE AN ASSESSMENT OF THE- CURRENT. NUMBER OF REQUESTS AND ENCAMPMENTS THAT TO NEED YOUR ATTENTION. OF IS THE FUNDING SUFFICIENT TO ADDRESS THOSE AND THEN ALSO KEEP UP WITH THE ANTICIPATED WORKLOAD BEYOND. BECAUSE OF AN ART LET ME JUST SAY IF IT'S NOT I WILL ADVOCATE FOR PUTTING MORE MONEY IN THE POT FOR YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT AND I WILL I WILL SAY THIS IN RESPONSE.
