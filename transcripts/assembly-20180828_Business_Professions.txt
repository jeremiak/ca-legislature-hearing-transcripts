THESE MEDICAL EXPERTS PROVIDE EXPERT TESTIMONY RELATIVE TO THE CASE AS WELL AS CON. CONDUCT PROFESSIONAL COMPETENCY MEDICAL AND PSYCHIATRIC EXAMS BOTH SIDES OF THE CASE ARE PRIVY TO TO BE INFORMATION REGARDING THE EXPERT WITNESSES IN AN EFFORT TO ENSURE THAT THE WITNESS IS QUALIFIED. THE INFORMATION IS COMPILED IN THE FORM OF REPORTS FORMS AND STATEMENTS REGARDING THE WITNESSES CREDENTIALS AND OPINIONS ON THE CASE AT HAND. HOWEVER CURRENT LAW REQUIRES THIS INFORMATION TO BE PROVIDED TO THE OTHER PART PARTY WITHIN THIRTY DAYS PRIOR TO THE SCHEDULED HEARING WHICH CAN BE DIFFICULT TO COMPLETE GIVEN ALL OF THE REQUIREMENTS.
