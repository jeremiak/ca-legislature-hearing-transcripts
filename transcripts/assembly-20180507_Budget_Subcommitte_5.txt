I QUITE LIKE I WILL NOT GIVE UP UNTIL WE MAKE SOME KIND OF INVESTMENT. BECAUSE THE LOCKING UP OUR YOUNG PEOPLE REALLY IS NOT THE ANSWER. AND TWENTY SIXTEEN OF THE APPROXIMATELY TWENTY SIX FIFTY TWO THOUSAND YOU DIRECTED ARRESTED. MORE THAN FORTY THREE THOUSAND YOUTH WERE ARRESTED FOR MISDEMEANORS. STATUS OF STATUS OFFENSES THINGS LIKE PETTY THEFT SCHOOL FIGHT SMOKING MARIJUANA RUNNING AWAY AND VIOLATING CURFEW. HOW DO WE JUSTIFY? THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA THAT WE ARE SPENDING BETWEEN TWO HUNDRED TO THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. KEEP A KID. LOCKED UP FOR THINGS LIKE THAT. EVEN THOSE FORTY THREE THOUSAND KIDS OUT OF THE SYSTEM WILL SAVE US. OVER ONE YEAR. APPROXIMATELY EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS. THE HOUSTON VESTMENT FUND PROPOSED PROPOSALS BROKEN UP IN THE FOLLOWING MANNER. SEVENTY FIVE BILLION TO FUND LOCAL DIVERSION PROGRAMS FOR AT RISK YOUTH. FIFTEEN MILLION TO HIGHER SOCIAL WORKERS IN PUBLIC DEFENDER OFFICES TO SUPPORT CASES WHERE MINORS ARE ARRESTED.

COMMUNITY BASED AND HEALTH BASED INTERVENTION VENGEANCE. WITH ME WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY AND URGE YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS IMPORTANT INVESTMENT. TODAY IS FRANKIE GOOD MA OF THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR YOUTH LAW. SHANE MURPHY GOLDSMITH OF THE LIBERTY HILL FOUNDATION. AND COMMANDER. GERALD WOULD YA WOODYARD. OF THE LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT MEMBERS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. AND MISTER BOOZE LIKE IT'S OUR FIRST BEEN. MISSED BOTH SMITH AND THEN IT WILL HAVE TWO MINUTES. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. SO UP. MY NAME'S FRANK IN I AM THE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA YOUTH JUSTICE INITIATIVE AT THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR YOUTH LAW. OR I HAVE BEEN. FOCUSED ON ENDING THE PRACTICE THE PROSECUTING YOUTH ADULTS ARE REDUCING. OUR RELIANCE OUR STATE RELIANCE ON INCARCERATION TO DEAL WITH YOUNG PEOPLE WHILE ALSO BUILDING NOW HELP BASED AND AND COMMUNITY BASED ALTERNATIVES THAT HAVE BEEN PROVEN EFFECTIVE FOR FOR THIS POPULATION. TO PROMOTE POSITIVE OUTCOMES AND REDUCE RECIDIVISM AND IS WHAT THAT SAID THAT I CAN I'D LIKE TO JUST AND THE FACT THAT I'M VERY. HONOR TO BE HERE TO SUPPORT THIS AYE YOU THREE INVESTMENT FUND WHICH IT WOULD. ALLOCATE A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FORGET THAT VERSION BUT THE FOCUS ON A NATIVE AMERICAN YOUTH. AS WELL AS TO SUPPORT SOCIAL WORKERS AND PUBLIC DEFENDER OFFICES. OF THE REASON WHY DO THIS WORK AND WHY I BELIEVE IN THIS IN THIS BILL IT BECAUSE AMOUNT PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WITH SYSTEM INVOLVEMENT. AS A YOUNG PERSON ON MY FIRST OFFENSE THAT WAS ARRESTED IN AND COMMITTED TO THE YOUTH AUTHORITY WITH THE FIFTEEN YEAR SENTENCE. ARE IN A WITH A BIT OF. YOU KNOW WHAT I WOULD SAY YOU KNOW GOING INTO INTO THAT SITUATION I CAME WITH A LOT OF OF OF TRAUMA YOU KNOW I I WAS EXPERIENCE DEVELOPMENT FAMILIES DIVORCE HOMELESSNESS DELIGHT INCARCERATION OF MY BROTHER. A LOT OF COMMUNITY VIOLENCE. AND ALL OF THAT TOOK A TOLL ON YOU KNOW AND AND AND ULTIMATELY LANDED ME. IN IN IN IN IN CUSTODY AND WHAT I CAN TELL YOU FROM THAT EXPERIENCE IS INCARCERATION ONLY MAYBE WORSE. I DIDN'T REALLY ADDRESSED ANY OF THE UNDERLYING NEEDS THAT WERE THAT AFFECTED ME. AYE AND LET ME ON THAT PATH AND IT WAS ACTUALLY IN SPITE OF THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS IF NOT MILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT THE STATE INVESTED IN KEEPING ME INCARCERATED THAT I GOT OUT. AND FOUND THE HEALTH IN THE SUPPORT THAT I NEEDED IN MY COMMUNITY THROUGH THE FAITH COMMUNITY SPACES. AND AN AUTHENTIC COMMUNITY LEADERS WITH QUALITY SERVICES THATHELP ME BELIEVE IN MYSELF WHEN I YOU KNOW I HAVE TO SAY I HAD TO BORROW THEIR CONFIDENCE IN ME BEFORE I HAD ANY CONFIDENCE IN MYSELF. UP AND AND YOU KNOW TODAY YOU KNOW MY IT IN MY LEGAL PROFESSION AND AS WELL AS MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE I CAN SAY THAT WE HAVE THE STATE KNOW WHAT WORKS. YOU KNOW THE ADOLESCENT BRAIN DEVELOPMENT DE THE CRIMINAL. JUSTICE RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT INCARCERATION IS BAD FOR ALL PEOPLE PARTICULARLY FOR YOUNG PEOPLE. AYE AND IN LOOKING AT LIFE COURSE AYE TRAJECTORIES THE GREATEST DETERMINE OF WHETHER A YOUNG PERSON WILL BE LOCKED UP. AYE IS NOT WHETHER THEY HAD PREVIOUSLY COMMITTED A VIOLENT CRIME OR WHETHER THEY'RE GETTING INVOLVED. THE SIMPLE FACT OF HAVING BEEN INCARCERATED ONCE BEFORE. AND SO IF WE KNOW THE INCARCERATION HARM KIDS YOU KNOW WE REALLY NEED TO DO BETTER ABOUT FINDING ALTERNATIVES AND THAT IS WHAT THIS THIS. BUDGET HERE PRESENT TO PREVENT AN OPPORTUNITY FIGHT FOR DIVERSION WHICH EVIDENCE SHOWS IS EFFECTIVE IN GETTING KIDS OUT OF THE HARMFUL SYSTEM. OF KNOTTED INCARCERATION BUT FIFTEEN INVOLVEMENT CAN BE HARMFUL AND PUT THEM ON A PATH TOWARDS HEALTH INSTABILITY. BUT IT ALSO PLACES. THEM IN COMMUNITY SETTINGS WITH SERVICES THAT ARE SHOWN EFFECTIVE THAT ARE A COMMON FORM CULTURALLY ROOTED AND DEVELOPMENTALLY APPROPRIATE WHICH IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE KIDS. LEARN DIFFERENTLY THAN THAN ADULTS DO WHEN THEY NEED TREATMENT THAT IS TAILORED TO THEIR SPECIFIC NEEDS IF SOMEONE UP PLEASE SURE. ARM IN ARTS ULTIMATELY WHAT WHAT I. ONE EMPHASIZES WE'VE INVESTED IN AND IN ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN THE YOUTH JUSTICE SYSTEM TO KEEP KIDS LOCKED UP. WHAT THIS DOES IT IS IT INVEST THE ALTERNATIVES BY BY PUTTING MONEY IN THE HANDS OF THE COMMUNITY? PROVIDERS THAT ARE. PROVEN EFFECTIVE AT PROVIDING THE SERVICES IT BUILDS COLLABORATION BETWEEN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE ENTITIES THE COMMUNITY AND LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND ALSO I IN TERMS OF COST EFFECTIVENESS IF IT REQUIRES COUNTIES TO PROVIDE TWENTY FIVE PERCENT MATCHING FUNDS. TO UTILIZE EXISTING AND OFTEN UNUSED FUNDS FOR HEALTH AND DEVELOPMENT. AND AND AND AND LASTLY IN TERMS OF INVESTMENT FOR EVERYONE DOLLAR THAT WE INVEST IN DIVERSION WE RETURN WE GET THREE DOLLARS. RETURN ON OUR INVESTMENT AND SO YOU KNOW WE AT WHAT I CAN SAY IS YOU KNOW THIS REDUCES HARM IT INVESTMENT KIDS. AND IT AND IT UTILIZES SCARES OFF WORKMAN RESOURCES WERE NEEDS TO BE ALL WHILE PROMOTING POSITIVE OUTCOMES FOR YOUNG PEOPLE. AND KEEPING OUR OUR OUR COMMUNITY SAFE SO WE URGE YOUR AYE I'LL AYE VOTE ON THIS THANK YOU. WE WENT A LITTLE BIT OVER. THAT IS WHAT THEY WILL. OUR NEXT PERSON'S GONNA KEEP US ON TASK GOOD. I'M SHAME GOLDSMITH PRESIDENT CEO LIBERTY HEALTH FOUNDATION. CALIFORNIA HAS AN OPPORTUNITY AND A RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE AN INVESTMENT AND PROVEN COMMUNITY DIVERSION PROGRAMS THAT GIVE OUR YOUTH A SECOND CHANCE TO LEAD SUCCESSFUL LIVES. WE KNOW THAT SENDING KIDS A PRISON DOES NOT WORK. WE KNOW THAT AS MR GOODS MONTHS THAT INCARCERATION LEAVES KIDS WORSE OFF THAN IT FINDS THEM. DETAILING A KID FOR A YEAR IN LA COUNTY COSTS TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS WITH THAT SAME MONEY IF IT'S AND FIFTY KIDS TO COMMUNITY DIVERSION PROGRAMS THAT ARE THREE TIMES MORE EFFECTIVE. AT PREVENTING YOU FROM RE OFFENDING. I'M ALSO A POLICE COMMISSIONER FOR THE LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT COPS WHAT MORE OF THESE PROGRAMS THEY TELL ME THEY ARE RESTING KIDS THEY DON'T WANT TO ARREST. BECAUSE THERE ISN'T ENOUGH MONEY IN THESE COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS TO PROVIDE DIVERSION SERVICES HAVE A COMMANDER FROM LAPD HERE WHO CAN TELL I'M YOURS WHO CAN TELL YOU HIMSELF. SO YOU CAN CHANGE THAT YOU CAN STOP TENS OF THOUSANDS OF YOUNG PEOPLE FROM BEING ARRESTED AND INCARCERATED BECAUSE THESE ARE OUR KIDS THESE ARE ALL OF OUR KIDS AND WE NEED THEM. WE NEED THEM DESPERATELY TO SURVIVE TO THRIVE TO SUCCEED AND BY GIVING KIDS THE RIGHT HELP BEFORE THEY STEP INSIDE OF A JAIL CELL WE'RE GIVING THEM A CHANCE. WE'RE SAYING THAT WE BELIEVE IN THEIR POTENTIAL NOT ONLY RETAINING THEIR LIVES WERE MAKING ALL OF US SAFER BECAUSE THERE WERE MUCH MUCH LESS LIKELY TO COMMIT CRIMES THE FUTURE. MY OWN BROTHER IF HE HAD HAD A PROGRAM LIKE THIS TWENTY YEARS AGO I AM CERTAIN THAT HE WOULD NOT HAVE ENDED UP IN JAIL AND HOMELESS FOR THE LAST TWENTY YEARS. IN PHILANTHROPY WE'RE PUTTING OUR MONEY INTO YOU DIVERSION OF THE HEAD OF A FOUNDATION I'M PART OF A NETWORK OF FOUNDATIONS ACROSS THE STATE. THEY'RE INVESTING IN THESE DIVERSION PROGRAMS BECAUSE WE SEE IT AS A FIRST STEP AT ENDING MASS INCARCERATION AND WE ALSO SEE IT IS AN IMPORTANT INVESTMENT IN FIXING THE RACIAL INJUSTICES IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. AS THE NATION GRAPPLED WITH THESE ISSUES. THIS IT CALIFORNIA'S OPPORTUNITY TO ONCE AGAIN LEAD WAS SOLUTIONS THAT ARE GROUNDED IN SMART POLICY FISCAL EFFICIENCY AND A COMMITMENT TO JUSTICE SO I URGE YOU TO PLEASE INVEST A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN THE CREATION OF YOU THREE INVESTMENT FUND. THIS. A GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYONE I'M HONORED AND HUMBLED TO SPEAK WITH YOU BRIEFLY ABOUT THE JUVENILE REST DIVERSION PROGRAM. AND EXPRESSING ON BEHALF OF THE ENTIRETY OF THE LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT AND CHIEF CHARLIE BECK IN PARTICULAR. THAT WE ARE IN FULL SUPPORT OF FUNDING OF THE FUNDING REQUESTS FOR THE YOUTH REINVESTMENT WHICH IS BEING SPEARHEADED BY SIMPLY MEMBER REGINALD JONES SAWYER. I GREW UP IN THIS COMMUNITY SACRAMENTO FAT AND OPPORTUNITY TO GO DOWN TO. SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA PLAY FOOTBALL DOWN THERE BUT THE COMMUNITY I GREW UP IN. IS DEL PASO HEIGHTS WITH THE GRANT HIGH SCHOOL. AND THAT COMMUNITY MAYORS WHERE I WORK AT RIGHT NOW IS SOUTH CENTRAL LOS ANGELES. AND OF ALL THE COMMUNITIES THAT NEED DIVERSION. THAT COMMUNITY IS THE MOST VULNERABLE. AHMED IF THAT COMMUNITY DOESN'T THRIVE THEN THE THE ENTIRETY OF THE CITY OF LA DOESN'T THRIVE. SO THE JUVENILE REST A DIVERSION PROGRAM HAS BEEN A PRIORITY THE LOSS IN LIKE THE LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT FOR THE PAST FIVE YEARS. BECAUSE OF THAT ORGANIZATION WE INNATELY KNOW THAT A YOUNG PERSON WITH A MINIMAL ADDRESS HISTORY. OR WHO WAS BEING ARRESTED FOR THE FIRST TIME. HERE SHE MUST BE DIVERTED. IT THE NUMBERS OR THE THEORY IS TRUE. THAT A CHILD THAT IS A RECIPE FOR THE FIRST TIME AS OPPOSED TO BEING DIVERTED HAS AN EIGHTY PERCENT CHANCE. OF RE OFFENDING. IN THAT SAME CHILD IF THEY'RE DIVERTED. WE SEE THE NUMBERS WHERE. THE RE OFFENDING PERSON THIS GOES DOWN ABOUT TWENTY PERCENT. THEN CLEARLY IT'S IT'S IT'S IT'S ALMOST ILLOGICAL TO NOT DIVERT IN OUR OPINION. DIVERSE IMPROVISE THE YOUNG PERSON. AND HIS OR HER PARENTS OR GUARDIAN AN OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN PROGRAMS OR RECEIVE WRAPAROUND SERVICES. THAT ARE GEARED TOWARD ALTERNATIVES OTHER THAN INCARCERATION. WE FULLY SUPPORT DIVERSION FOR YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN THAT HAVE A MINIMAL REST HISTORY. AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR YOUR TIME IN THIS MATTER AND WE URGE YOU TO VOTE YES.

YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR. TESTIMONY IS LOW COMMENTS RESHAPE IT ALL BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS FROM ANY MEMBER. YES MISTER LACKEY. YEAH I JUST HAVE A QUICK QUESTION OF OF THIS. SIGNIFICANT FUNDING IS BEING ASKED FOR. HOW MUCH OF THIS IS A FOCUSED ON? PREVENTION. HIGH RISK PREVENTION FOR EXAMPLE WE HAVE. I'M VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE PROGRAM FOR THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY SHERIFF SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT. KNOWN AS THE VITAL INTERVENTION DIRECTIONAL OF ALTERNATIVES VIDA PROGRAM. WHICH I THINK IT'S. BEEN PROVEN TO BE VERY VERY SUCCESSFUL. OF. IS THAT PART OF THE. THE PROCESS HERE WE JUST TALKING COMPLETELY OFFENDERS THROUGH A DIVERSION PROGRAM SO NAM THE WAY WE LOOK AT THIS PROGRAM ANY ENTITY IN THE STATE CAN APPLY IT WILL BE A GRANT FUNDED PROGRAM TO DO. THE SEC AND SO IF A. IF. A COMMUNITY A CITY IT COUNTY WANT TO APPLY THEY CAN APPLY. BOB THE ONLY REQUIREMENT WILL ASK IS IS THAT THEY HAVE TO PUT ASIDE SOME MONIES TO HAVE SOME SKIN IN THE GAME DILUTED DECIDED THAT WANT TO BE INVOLVED. THE PROGRAM YEAR YOU'RE MENTIONING PROBABLY WOULD. WOULD DEFINITELY QUALIFY BECAUSE THEY'RE ALREADY EXPANDING. FUNDING OF DEBT TO HELP AT RISK YOUTH AND SO THAT COULD BE ONE OF THE ARM PROGRAMS THAT COULD APPLY FOR FUNDING FROM JUST UNDER MILLION DOLLARS. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS JUST STONE. THANK YOU I'M HAPPY TO JOIN WITH YOU ON THIS IN THIS IS ON THERE A VERY VERY MUCH HOPE. THAT THIS BODY WILL WILL PUT FORWARD IT'S IT'S TRULY AN INVESTMENT. IN COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN SHORT CHANGED IN OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM FOR FAR TOO LONG WE WE DON'T TALK ABOUT RACE. ANYMORE IT'S NOT POLITICALLY CORRECT. WHICH IS A REAL SHAME AND IT LEADS TO VERY DIRE CIRCUMSTANCES IN SOME OF OUR MOST UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. WE SHOULD NOT BE SHOT THAT IF WE GO IN I KNOW YOU'VE TOURED JUNE OF FACILITIES AND THE JAILS. AND IT'S MOSTLY YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN OF COLOR WHO ARE THERE BECAUSE OF IMPLICIT BIAS AND SOMETIMES EXPLICIT BY. AND PUTTING MONEY. INTO OUR COMMUNITIES WHERE THERE'S FOR DIVERSION PROGRAMS ARE PREVENTION PROGRAMS AND TO ME A DIVERSION PROGRAM IS A PREVENTION PROGRAM. BECAUSE TAKING A CHILD WHO HAS MADE A MISTAKE IN COMING FROM VERY. DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES THEIR OWN TRIBE IT'S THEIR OWN TROUBLES IN THEIR FAMILY AND GIVING THEM AN OPPORTUNITY TO ATONE FOR WHAT WENT WRONG BUT REALLY. HELPING THEM. UNDERSTAND THAT BE ABLE TO RE INTEGRATE TO NOT TOUCH JUVENILE HALL TO NOT TOUCH THE PROGRAMS THAT WE KNOW EXACERBATE THE RECIDIVISM RATES HERE IN CALIFORNIA. IS TO ME WHAT THIS INVESTMENT IS ALL ABOUT AND WE CAN EITHER CONTINUE SPEND OBSCENE AMOUNTS OF MONEY TO LOCK KIDS UP. AND THEN LOCK THEM UP WHEN THEY'RE IN ADULTS AND AND KEEP THOSE CYCLES GOING OH WE CAN START TO BREAK THE CYCLE. AND INVEST IN OUR COMMUNITIES IN A PRODUCTIVE WAY THAT ENSURES THAT THEY WILLNOT SUFFER FOR THE TRAUMAS THAT. THEY'VE BEEN EXPERIENCING THIS WORLD NOT PASS THOSE PROBLEMS ON TO THE NEXT GENERATION SO THIS HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS I REALLY WOULD HOPE WOULD BE A. DOWN PAYMENT AN EARLY AND MICHELIN VESTMENTS THAT WILL PAY DIVIDENDS AND WILL KEEP US FROM HAVING TO EXPAND. HUNDREDS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN THE FUTURE. LOCKING PEOPLE UP BECAUSE THAT'S BEEN THE PATTERN FOR TOO LONG. AND THIS WAS. THIS IS A GREAT PROGRAM I THINK THAT THIS IS THE SEED FOR REALLY SEEING HOW WE CAN SHIP. THE JUSTICE CONVERSATION CALIFORNIA ESPECIALLY FOR THESE KIDS AND GIVE THEM THE OPPORTUNITY THAT SO THAT WHEN OTHERWISE BEEN DENIED THEM SO. I'M ENTIRELY WITH YOU ON THIS THING SIR AND I HOPE THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE A RECOMMENDATION OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE. AND REALLY PUSH IT WITH THE SENATE AND PUSH IT WITH THE GOVERNOR AND SEE THIS IS AN INVESTMENT SHOULD DEAL IN ALIGNMENT WITH. KINDS OF. AND JUSTICE. REALIGNMENT REFORM THAT THE GOVERNOR'S BEEN INTERESTED IN AND THIS IS A LITTLE BIT OF PUT YOUR MONEY WHERE YOUR MOUTH IS THIS IS INSURING THAT WE'RE GETTING TO THESE COMMUNITIES. IN A WAY THAT WILL BE IMPACTFUL. AND AND LEAD TO HEALTHIER COMMUNITIES IN THE FEW. YOU. WELL I THANK YOU ALL FOR COMING ARE WE APPRECIATE THEM. THOSE WHO CAME SO FAR FROM OF DOWN IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA APPEAR TO BASICALLY EMPHASIZE AND SUPPORT THIS CONCEPT. OF THIS ITEM WILL BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION. CLEARLY. MOST OF US HAVE SPENT QUITE A BIT OF TIME WORKING ON THESE PARTICULAR ISSUES WITH REGARDS TO BOYS AND MEN OF COLOR. AND THE KINDS OF CHALLENGES THAT THEY FACE AS WELL AS ALL OF THE YOU FACE IN THE STATE. I THINK MOST OF US WERE AGHAST WHEN WE DISCOVERED THE AMOUNT OF MONEY WE SPEND IN JUVENILE JUSTICE. PUT IN FIFTY TO THREE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR PER CHILD UP TO A FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR PER CHILD. IT IS STAGGERING WHEN ONE THINKS ABOUT. THAT LEVEL OF RESOURCES PUT INTO ONE PLACE WITH THEM WITH THE KIND OF SICK LACK OF SUCCESS THAT WE HAVE IN THAT SYSTEM. SO THIS IS UP HERE IN COMPARISON TO THAT IT'S ALMOST A DROP IN THE BUCKET REALLY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. A WHAT IT TAKES TO KEEP FOR KIDS AND JUVENILE JUSTICE AND COMPARISON TO THE REQUESTS OF THAT'S THAT WOULD LOOKING AT A MORE YOU KNOW SO IT'S IT'S SO. IT'S REALLY INTERESTING IN TERMS OF WHAT WE SEE. WE CAN DO A MILLION DOLLARS OF FOR ALL. FOUR KIDS AND STILL IN IT WOULD LITTLE LITTLE SUCCESS IN TERMS OF WHAT HAPPENED SO UP WE WOULD EVER TAKE THIS ON A SERIOUS ADVISEMENT THAT WE'VE. I TALKED ABOUT IT WE WITHOUT MISTER JONES SAWYER AND THOSE WHO CAME. BECAUSE SOME WHAT WE HAVE TO TURN THE TIDE. AND AND DO WHAT'S MARK. A RATHER THAN JUST CONFLICT DO WHAT WE DID WE KNOW THAT THERE'S A LOT OF. ALWAYS A LOT OF FEAR MONGERING WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT NOT INCARCERATING PEOPLE BECAUSE WE THINK INCARCERATION MAKES PEOPLE SAFE. BUT IT REALLY DOES NOT EVERY COMMUNITY SUFFERS FROM T. I GOT A CALL I GUESS THIS MORNING LAST NIGHT WITH THREE YOUNG MEN WERE KILLED IN MY COMMUNITY MANDY AIGLE. ALL THEY HAD BEEN GANG MEMBERS BEFORE HAVE BEEN INCARCERATED ON AND OFF DIFFERENT TIMES THAT'LL WHO GOT OUT OF JAIL DIDN'T GET OUT OF JAIL BUT IMMEDIATELY. KILLED THREE YOUNG MEN. AND. AND AS A RESULT SOME OF THEM FATHERS SO YOU TALKING ABOUT THE TRAUMA OF THAT ON THEIR FAMILIES THAT COMMUNITIES. THAT THE CHILDREN THAT WILL BE COME WITH THAT WILL EXIST IN THIS WORLD WITHOUT A FATHER. WAS KILLED IN GANG VIOLENCE AND ON AND ON AND ON AND SO WE KNOW THAT THE TRAUMA IS. JUST CONTINUES IS INTERGENERATIONAL ARE AND WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A WAY IN WHICH WE STOP IT. OF CHILDREN WHO ARE RAISED IN LIVING TRAUMA A DO NOT IN THAT WOULD VERY GOOD RESULTS WE KNOW THAT A WITH ITS IN SCHOOL WHETHER IT'S AND YOU WANT JUSTICE SYSTEM SO. OF% CALIFORNIA'S BETTER THAN THAT I BELIEVE VERY STRONGLY A WE KNOW HOW TO DO THINGS WE JUST WRAPPED UP THE COURAGE TO DO. YOU KNOW AND THE RESOURCES SO THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH IT SOUNDS LIKE A LOT OF MONEY. HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS WAS JONES SAWYER HAS BEEN BUGGING ME ABOUT. HOW MANY YEARS ON THE? I COULD PRY PAID FOR BY NOW. WE COULD HAVE SAVED IT PASSED THE BY NOW AFFINITIES LET ME SAY THAT I I APPRECIATE ALL THOSE WHO CAME THIS IS A SERIOUS PROPOSAL. ONE THAT THIS COMMITTEE WILL LOOK AT VERY SERIOUSLY AND I HOPE THAT THE YELLOW THE MEMBERS AND OTHERS WILL LOOK AT IT WE'VE HAD LOTS OF ACTIVITY IN DISCUSSION AROUND. OF THIS ISSUE AND WE'VE HAD LOTS OF FOUNDATIONS THAT ENDOWMENT AND OTHERS HAVE HELPED TO DO SOME THINGS WE HAVE AMOUNT OF RESEARCH. AMOUNT OF RESEARCH ON WHAT IS GOOD FOR FOR PEOPLE AND GOT AND I THINK IS A STATE THAT HAS. HAS SOMEHOW ANOTHER BEEN IDENTIFIED AS THE STATE TO INCARCERATE MORE PEOPLE THAN. ALL THE COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD THAT'S CALIFORNIA WITH ALL OF THE GREAT THINGS THAT WE DO THIS IS A ONE SORE SPOT THAT IS NOT A BRIGHT SPOT FOR CALIFORNIA. A NONE OF US ARE POLICE WITH ARC INCARCERATE THEIR PRISON SYSTEM. ARE AND IT AND WHETHER NOT IT'S AN EFFECTIVE SYSTEM WE'VE BEEN GRAPPLING WITH THAT. OF THE OVERCROWDING THE TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY WE PUT INTO THE OVER CROWDED SITUATION WE'RE DOING OUR BEST TO TRY TO CHANGE THE SYSTEM AND REFORM IT. AND WE'VE REDUCED OUR PRISON POPULATION WHICH IS GOOD BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO GET TO THE POINT WHERE WE REALLY REDUCE BECAUSE WE'RE NOT SENDING PEOPLE THERE. AND THAT JUST LETTING PEOPLE OUT EARLIER. SO IT IT'S A MAJOR A MAJOR UNDERTAKING AND I'M A COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS STRUGGLE VERY HARD TO KEEP THE DOORS OPEN. THEY'RE PEOPLE WHO HIGHLY COMMITTED. TO MAKE IT WORK AND. AND OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT WORKS WITH THEM BUT THEY ALSO KNOW THERE'S NOT ENOUGH COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS WHO HAVE THE RESOURCES TO DO IT SO. I THINK ALL OF US HAVE TO DO SOME SOUL SEARCHING WHEN IT COMES TO THIS BECAUSE WE HAVE TO DO WHAT'S RIGHT FOR OUR KIDS. SO THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH FOR COMING THANKS OF ALL THOSE WHO OUTSIDE FOR COMING AND THANK YOU MISS JONES SAWYER FOR BRINGING THE PROPOSAL FOR AND ON BEHALF OF THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU DEPUTY. WE'VE HAD A REQUEST FROM MISTER COOPER TO COME FORTY HAS A PERSON WHO'S TRAVELED HERE WHO HAS A FLIGHT TO CATCH I BELIEVE. IS THAT RIGHT WAS LITTLE PER. THANK YOU WE'RE GIVING EACH ONE OF THE MEMBERS WE KNOW THIS WAS AN EXCEPTIONAL ONE BECAUSE WE HAD SO MANY FOLKS COMING FROM ELSEWHERE. WE'RE GIVING EACH MEMBER LIKE TEN MINUTES TO MAKE THEIR PLEA. SOME OF YOU'VE ALREADY BEEN IN MY OFFICE ON YOUR KNEES AND SO ON. I'VE HEARD SOME OF YOUR PLEASE ALREADY. BUT DOUBLE ONE MAKE SURE THAT EVERY MEMBER GETS AN OPPORTUNITY WHOSE WHO MADE A PROPOSAL TO DO THAT SO IT GOING TO YOU AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO GO BACK TO THE FIRST TWO ITEMS ON THE AGENDA. OF THIS PROMISE TO GO TO THOSE ITEMS THAT ARE DISCUSSION ITEMS SO MISTER COOPER THINKING NATURAL AND I PROMISE TO BE DONE TEN MINUTES IN OUR ASK IS MUCH MUCH LESS. VICTORY OPPORTUNITY TO APPEAR BEFORE YOU SPEAK ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF FUNDING FOR THE INTERNET CRIMES AGAINST CHILDREN TASK FORCES OR OTHERWISE KNOWN AS ICAC. IN A CRIMES AGAINST CHILDREN TASK FORCE PROGRAM THE NATIONAL NETWORK. SIXTY ONE COORDINATE TASK FORCES REPRESENTING OVER THREE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT IN PROSECUTION AGENCIES. THIS IS A CONTINUING GAYS IN PROACTIVE AND REACTIVE INVESTIGATION THE PROSECUTION'S A PERSONS INVOLVED IN CHILD ABUSE. AN EXPORTATION INVOLVING THE INTERNET. CALIFORNIA OPERATES FIVE I CAC TASK FORCES LOCATED FRESNO SACRAMENTO SAN DIEGO SAN JOSE AND LOS ANGELES. HE'S LIFESAVING RESEARCH HAS OUR FIRST ADDED TO THE STATE BUDGET IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT. THE HEIGHT WITH A BEER BUDGET CRISIS. BY ELEVEN BILLION DOLLARS SHORTFALL IN REVENUE. THE LEGISLATURE UNDERSTOOD THE IMPORTANCE OF PROTECTING CHILDREN. SEXUAL EXPLOITATION. WELL FIVE MILLION IS A TINY FRACTION OF THE ENTIRE STATE BUDGET. THE FUNDING IS CRITICAL TO THE I CAC TASK FORCES. I KEPT TASK FORCES ARE THE ONLY ENTITIES FIGHTING. THE FLOURISHING UNDERGROUND MARKET IN CHILD* WHICH MAKES SEXUAL COMMODITIES OF OUR CHILDREN. EVERY WEEK CHOSEN A RESCUE DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY BY AYE TAX THE RICH THING SEXUAL PREDATORS. AS A FORMER COMMANDER THE SECOND LIKE HECK TASK FORCE I THOUGHT DIFFERENT LIES TO PROTECT OUR CHILDREN FROM SEXUAL PREDATORS ONLINE. NOW'S NOT THE TIME TO GIVE THE FIGHT. WITH YOUR DATE SUPPORT IS ALISON ARNGRIM PRESIDENT. THE BOARD OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION PROTECT CHILDREN. MAINTENANCE KID ADAMS AND DETECTIVE SHAWN SMITH CONSECUTIVE VALLEY INTERNET CRIMES AGAINST CHILDREN TASK FORCE. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON I'M ALISON ARNGRIM ALL YOU MAY KNOW ME FOR MY WORK ON LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE. BUT TODAY I AM HERE AS THE. PRESIDENT OF NATIONAL ESPECIALLY ILLEGAL. WELL LOOK AT THE I WAS ACTUALLY HERE LAST YEAR AGO WE WENT THROUGH THIS BECAUSE I WAS ASKING FOR THE FUNDING TO BE PUT BACK AND I'M. BACK IN THOSE YOU WILL FROM THE LOWER HOUSE WELL NOW NOW NO PROBLEM I SEE VERY AGO AND I'M BACK AGAIN AND AND WE WANT THE THE WORKER OVER INTERNET CRIMES AGAINST CHILDREN TASK FORCE TO BE RETURNED TO THE BUDGET THEIR MONEY. OF SEVERITY THE PROBLEM OBVIOUSLY IS NOT A QUESTION WE KNOW THAT INTO TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THERE WERE OVER EIGHTY THOUSAND UNIQUE IP ADDRESSES IN CALIFORNIA WHICH WERE TRADING IMAGES OF CHILDREN BEING SEXUALLY ASSAULTED. THESE VICTIMS ARE EXTREMELY YOUNG OF IN THESE VIDEOS WE'RE OFF THEIR SEEING CHILDREN OFTEN LESS THAN THREE YEARS OLD TODDLERS AND INFANTS VIDEOS INCLUDE EXTREME ACTS. OF VIOLENCE AND TORTURE MOST OF THE VICTIMS IN THESE CASES ARE NOT CAPABLE OF REPORTING THESE CRIMES COMMITTED AGAINST THE BECAUSE THE ICAC TEAMS ARE ABLE TO FIND THE VIDEOS THE PERPETRATORS IN THE ACT. THEY'RE ABLE TO PRODUCE AND NEARLY NINETY PERCENT CONVICTION RATE. WE THINK IS AN EXTREMELY EFFICIENT COST EFFECTIVE METHOD OF RESCUING THESE VICTIMS FOR FURTHER RAPE AND TRAUMA. I APPLAUD THE WORK OF THE BRAVE MEN AND WOMEN FOR CALIFORNIA I CAN'T TEAMS AND I ASK THAT THEY BE GIVEN EVERY RESOURCE POSSIBLE TO DO THEIR JOB. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON SEAN SMITH WITH THE SEGMENT ABOUT HIGH TECH CRIMES TASK FORCE AND I AGAIN FOUND HONOR TO COME BACK AND SPEAK THIS YEAR THEY DID WITH ALISON LAST YEAR. AND TODAY I'M I'M SPEAKING AS INVESTIGATOR NOT JUST INVESTIGATE ABOUT A FATHER ALSO ABOUT. RE THAT REFUNDING THE I CAC PROGRAMS WHICH WITHOUT WOULD TO ABSOLUTE DECIMATE THE ABILITY FOR INVESTIGATORS TO GO AND. COMMIT OR TO COMMIT THEMSELVES TO THE SOLE MISSION WHICH IS PROTECTING MOST VULNERABLE POPULATION IN OUR STATE TODAY THE CHILDREN. I THOUSAND SAID THE SPIKE IN THE NUMBER OF OFFENDERS IS UNBELIEVABLE OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS. THAT NATIONAL CENTER FOR MISSING AND EXPLOITED CHILDREN THE TIPS IN THIS TIPS OF CHILD* HAVE SKYROCKETED FROM ONE MILLION TO TEN MILLION PER YEAR WHO ARE CURRENTLY ON A. TREND FOR ABOUT A TWENTY PERCENT INCREASE IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN ALL STATIC FUNDING HAS REMAINED IN PLACE. OUR TASK FORCE ALONE AVERAGES ABOUT JUST UNDER TWO HUNDRED CHILD* CASES WHICH ARE GIVEN TO US PER YEAR EXCUSE ME PER MONTH. AND THESE IMAGES AND VIDEOS ARE SOME OF THE MOST HAUNTING AND HORRIFICALLY. UNBELIEVABLY UNIMAGINABLE THINGS THAT YOU COULD EVER. HOPE NEVER TO SEE I SHOULD SAY AND IT'S IMPORTANT NOTE THAT ARE NOT CARTOON IMAGES ARE NOT COMPUTER GRAPHIC IMAGES. THEIR THEIR LIVING BREATHING CHILDREN WHO WERE VIDEOTAPED A DEFENSELESS BEING FORCED INTO SEXUAL ACTS WITH ADULT MEN AND WOMEN. TWO YEAR OLDS WHO ARE BOUND AND HELD UPSIDE DOWN WALL IN ADULT MAN FORCE HIMSELF UPON HER. I'VE SEEN CHILDREN WHO ARE HANDCUFFED TO TABLES WHILE THEY ARE ASSAULTED BY DOGS. I'VE SEEN CHILDREN DRUG FIXING TRAINING VIDEOS OUT THERE TODDLERS WHO ARE CRYING AND BEGGING FOR THE ASSAULT TO STOP INFANTS WHO ARE SHRINKING AND SCREAMING IN PAIN. THESE ARE BUT OF THE FEW OF THE IMAGES THAT ARE BURNED IN MY MEMORY FROM THE CASES I'VE WORKED OVER THE YEARS. AND WHAT'S MORE DISTURBING IS IT'S FROM MANY CHILD PREDATORS IT'S NOT ENOUGH JUST TO SIMPLY VIEW THE VIDEO. IT'S ESTIMATED IN OUR TASK FORCE OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS ABOUT SIXTY TO SEVENTY PERCENT INCREASE IN THE NUMBER INDIVIDUALS WE ARRESTED FOR DOWNLOADING AND VIEWING CHOPPER NOW GRIFFEY. WHO SUBSEQUENTLY FOUND OUT AND THEY ADMITTED TO EITHER HAVING GONE HANDS ON TO ACTUALLY MOLESTED CHILD OR PLANNING INTENDING TO DO SO? AND EVEN MORE HORRIFIC TREND. IT THAT THE VICTIMS ARE SELECTING OR YOUNGER AND YOUNGER SPECIFICALLY FOR THE REASON THAT THEY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO DISCLOSE THE ACT COMMITTED UPON THEM. THEY'RE TOO YOUNG TO TALK FOR THEIR TOO YOUNG TO COMMUNICATE EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED. SO IN SHORT. ARE AS ALISON SAID AS AS I. EMPHASIZE THAT THE NUMBER OF ONLINE PREDATORS OUT THERE IT'S AN EPIDEMIC AND IT'S GROWING BY THE MINUTE. AND WE URGE YOU TO FIND CALIFORNIA'S I CAC TASK FORCES WE DO NOT LEAVE OUR CHILDREN DEFENCELESS THANK YOU. SO IT IT'S AN CLOSING THINK ABOUT TWENTY YEARS AGO FOR THE INTERNET YOU HAVE AN AFFINITY FOR CHILDREN. WHERE COULD YOU GO TO GET THAT? THEY'RE THEY'RE NO VIDEOS LIST MADE A HOMEMADE VIDEO BUT HE HAD BEEN THE INTERNET. CHOPPER DOT REFUSE TRADE ALL THE TIME IN THE LAST FOR AXEL TREE WILL SOON BE A PICTURE OF YOU DOING EX Y. IN THE. STILL THE TYPE IMAGES WE GET WITH THAT. CHILD* IT IS. IT IS DETECTIVE SMITH SAID. I NEVER THOUGHT THINGS LIKE THAT HAPPEN TO I WENT TO THAT TASK FORCE IN IT'S IT'S IT'S RAMPANT OUT THERE. AND PEOPLE ARE VIEWING IT ALL THE TIME IN DOWNLOADING IT AND WITH THE BIGGEST ISSUE NOW IS THE ACT UPON THAT. NO THEY'RE THEY'RE GOING HANDS OFF OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS. AT IT AND IT'S THE UPLOADING BECAUSE BILL IN ORDER TO JOIN THE LITTLE GROUPS THEY WILL SAY SHOW ME YOUR VIDEO. AND SO THEY UPLOAD THEY MOLEST THEIR OWN CHILDREN AND UPLIFT VIDEOS. DO HAVE ANY PUBLIC ANY COMMENTS JUST TO NAME AND AGENCIES SUPPORTER FOR WHATEVER. CAPTION. SHAWN HOFFMAN CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. OKAY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR SHAWN HOP IN THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION STRONG SUPPORT THE FUNDING THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ANY QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH PRETTY GOOD THANK YOU VERY MUCH ALL RIGHT THAT TAKES US BACK TO ITEM NUMBER ONE. ON THE ITEMS TO BE HURT ISSUE NUMBER ONE THAT HEALTH CARE FACILITY IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM. S. F. L. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS DEEMED BOARD REPRESENTING THE. FACILITY PLANNING CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT DIVISION FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION. I'D LIKE TO START WITH A LITTLE BACKGROUND ON THE HEALTH CARE FACILITY IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM OR THE HICKS THAT PROGRAM THAT WE'RE HERE TO TALK ABOUT TODAY. I IT'S DESIGNED TO ADDRESS. IMPROVEMENTS FOR PRIMARY AND SPECIALTY CARE CLINICS. AND OTHER RELATED OUTPATIENT SERVICES THROUGHOUT OUR PRISON SYSTEM. IT'S BASED ON THE RECEIVER'S TURNAROUND PLAN OF ACTION THAT WAS ESTABLISHED IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT AND THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE. MEDICAL INFRASTRUCTURE WITHIN THE US DEPARTMENT IS ONE OF THE COMPONENTS THAT'S NECESSARY. TO RECEIVE. CONTROL OF MEDICAL CARE BACK FROM THE RECEIVER. IT'LL INVOLVE SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT THOUSAND SQUARE FEET OF NEW CONSTRUCTION AND RENOVATION OF EXISTING SPACE. TO LEARN THIRTY EIGHT SEPARATE PROJECTS OR AN AVERAGE OF EIGHT SEPARATE PROJECTS AT EACH PRISON SO IT. HAS THAT EFFECT FAIRLY. FAIRLY HIGH LEVEL OF COMPLEXITY TO IT. WHAT WE'VE ACCOMPLISHED SO FAR IS ABOUT TWENTY TWO PERCENT OF TOTAL CONSTRUCTION STATEWIDE HUNDRED SIXTY EIGHT THOUSAND SQUARE FEET OF NEW OR RENOVATED SPACE SIXTEEN NEW BUILDINGS? BETWEEN NOW AND THE END OF THE CALENDAR YEAR WHERE IN A VERY ROBUST PHASE OF CONSTRUCTION WORRY ANTICIPATE GOING FROM TWENTY TWO PERCENT TO SEVENTY TWO PERCENT OF OVERALL CONSTRUCTION. ANOTHER THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO THOUSAND SQUARE FEET. THIRTY TWO ADDITIONAL CLINIC BUILDINGS AND WITH ALL OF THAT WE WILL HAVE COMPLETED CONSTRUCTION AT SEVEN OF OUR FACILITY STATEWIDE WITH THE REMAINING FACILITIES TO BE COMPLETED DIE IN TWENTY NINETEEN. BUT AS HAS BEEN DOCUMENTED THE PROGRAM HAS HAD. COST INCREASES ARE FROM A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT. FACTORS DESIGN ARAB ERRORS AND OMISSIONS IN THE PROGRAM UNANTICIPATED SITE CONDITIONS THAT WE'VE HAD TO BE IT HAD TO ADDRESS ONCE WE GOT INTO RENOVATION. AND A NEED TO CHANGE OUR PHRASING PLANS A IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN MEDICAL OPERATIONS AND SECURITY TO EACH PRISON. IT'S LED TO SIGNIFICANT COSTING CREATIONS GET INCREASES IN BOTH HARD CONSTRUCTION DOLLARS IDEATIONAL COSTS DUE TO GENERAL CONTRACTORS BECAUSE THEY BID IN EIGHTEEN MONTHS JOB THAT'S OUR TWENTY FOUR MONTH JOB. IN THE SAME THING WITH OUR. CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT CONSULTANTS. IT FOR PROGRAMS FUNDED FROM A VERY UNIQUE APPROPRIATION IN TWENTY TWELVE. BUDGET TRAILER BILL ESTABLISHED A SINGLE APPROPRIATION TO FUND ALL OF THESE THIRTY SOME ODD PRIDE THREE THIRTY SOME ODD PRISONS AND THE PUBLIC WORKS BOARD THROUGH ACTIONS TO ESTABLISH THE PROJECTS. AND TWO OF FUND ANY AUGMENTATIONS NECESSARY HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THAT APPROPRIATION AND DISTRIBUTING IT TO THE DIFFERENT PROJECTS. HOWEVER THROUGH APRIL OF THIS YEAR WE'VE REACHED ABOUT EIGHTEEN AND A HALF PERCENT OF THE ALLOWABLE TWENTY PERCENT AUGMENTATION. THAT'S WHAT BRINGS THE FINANCE LETTER IN FRONT OF YOU HERE. IT WOULD ADD SEVENTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS TO THE EXISTING APPROPRIATION FOR HICCUP. AND THE AUTHORITY WOULD BE ALLOCATED AND SORTED DOES NOT COME TO THE DEPARTMENT ADDRESS WITH THE A PUBLIC WORKS BOARD AND WOULD THEN BE SUBSEQUENTLY ALLOCATED TO THE DEPARTMENT ON A PROJECT BY PROJECT BASIS. AS NECESSARY. EXACTLY FOLLOWING THE SAME PROCESS AS THE EXISTING APPROPRIATION HAS BEEN AUGMENTED HAS BEEN. UP ALLOCATED TO EACH PROJECT. QUESTION ALSO ADDS. NOTIFICATION LANGUAGE DUE TO ITS UNUSUAL NATURE IN THE HIGH PROFILE THIS REQUEST A LEGISLATURE WAS HE REPORTS WHENEVER THIS FUNDING IS ALLOCATED THAT INDICATES HOW MUCH OF THE SEVENTY THREE MILLION HAS BEEN ALLOCATED. TO WHAT PROJECT THE REASONS FOR THAT ALLOCATION AND HOW MUCH OF THE SEVENTY THREE MILLION IS REMAINING. WITHOUT A APPROVAL OF THIS ADDITIONAL FUNDING. SOMEWHERE BETWEEN FOURTEEN AND EIGHTEEN PROJECTS WOULD NEED TO HALT CONSTRUCTION DURING THE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN FISCAL YEAR. WE'VE BEEN ASKED TO. TO HELP PEOPLE OUT BY PREDICTING WHEN THAT WOULD OCCUR FOR EACH PROJECT AND WERE UNABLE TO DO THAT BECAUSE THIS ISN'T ABOUT CASH FLOW. IF THIS WAS ABOUT THE PROJECTS NEED SO MUCH CASH PER MONTH AND WE KNEW HOW MUCH OF A HELP FOR THAT CASH WOULD BILL WOULD BE ABLE TO PREDICT. BUT THIS IS HAVING TO DO WITH THE CHANGE ORDERS THAT WE NEED TO EXECUTE WITH OUR CONTRACTORS ON THESE PROJECTS BECAUSE OF THESE CONDITIONS THAT ARE ARE UNFORESEEN. SO EACH CONTRACT EACH PROJECT HAS A CONTRACT CONTINGENCY AMOUNT AND WE CAN APPROVE CHANGE ORDERS AGAINST THAT AMOUNT WHEN THAT AMOUNT IS EXHAUSTED WE WILL NO LONGER BE ABLE TO PROVE CHANGE ORDERS IN THESE CHANGE ORDERS ARE TO. ADDRESS NECESSARY COMPONENTS OF THE PROJECT IT'S NOT ABOUT A PERSON IS CHANGE WHAT COLOR THEY WANT THE ROOM TO BE OR WHAT TYPE OF DESK THEY WANT THIS HAS TO DO WITH. WALLS WERE SUPPOSED TO GO FROM THE FLOOR ALL THE WAY TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOF DECK THAT ONE WE OPEN UP THE BUILDING FIND OUT IT STOPS AT THE CEILING AND SO WE'VE GOT TO CONSTRUCT THE A FULL WALL. FELL THESE UNANTICIPATED SITE CONDITIONS REQUIRE THESE CHANGE ORDERS AND WITHOUT THE ABILITY TO HAVE THIS ADDITIONAL FUNDING AND THEN GET IT ALLOCATED THROUGH THE PUBLIC WORKS BOARD. WILL HAVE TO STOP FOURTEENTH EIGHTEEN PROJECTS IN THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR. WE PROVIDED PROJECTED AUGMENTATION AMOUNTS OF FOR EACH PROJECT IN THE REASONS FOR THOSE AUGMENTATIONS A TO THE COMMITTEE AND TO THE LA OH. UNDERSTAND THIS ITEM IS TO BE ABLE HELD OPEN US WILL CONTINUE TO WORK OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL WEEKS TO ANSWER ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS THAT. THE COMMITTEE AND OF THE OHIO HAS. AND THANK YOU AND I CAN ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE AT THIS TIME OKAY AS THEY COME INTO FINANCE. HELLO. JONATHAN PETERSON WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE REJECT THE SEVENTY THREE MILLION DOLLAR REQUEST FOR% THE. INCREASE LEASE REVENUE AUTHORITY FOR HICK THAT. WHILE THE ADMINISTRATION TO PROVIDE SOME GENERAL INFORMATION ON HOW THE REQUEST WAS DEVELOPED THERE WASN'T A SUFFICIENT INFORMATION TO FULLY JUSTIFIED THE PROPOSAL SUCH AS. A THE SPECIFIC NEEDS THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED WITH THIS FUNDING AT EACH FACILITY IN THE COST OF ADDRESSING THOSE SPECIFIC NEEDS OR HOW IT ESTIMATED THE THIRTY POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN CONTINGENCY FUNDING AND SPECIFICALLY HOW THAT FUNDING WOULD BE USE. IN ORDER FOR THE LEGIS THROUGH WHAT IT THE LEGISLATURE TO HAVE THIS INFORMATION OR WHEN IT CONSIDERS ANY. FUTURE REQUEST RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE DIRECTED APARTMENT TO INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION ALONG WITH ANY FUTURE REQUESTS THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING EACH PROJECT WOULD RECEIVE HOW THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING ON EACH PROJECT WILL BE USED. THE INFORMATION JUSTIFYING PROPOSE CONTINGENCY FUNDS HOW MUCH ADDITIONAL OF LEASE REVENUE AUTHORITY IS NEEDED TO PREVENT PROJECTS FROM BEING DELAYED AND WHAT PROJECTS WOULD BE DELAYED WITHOUT ADDITIONAL FUNDING. SO BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT TO CONTINUE TO DEVELOP THIS INFORMATION. ANY OF THE COMMENTS REALLY WANT YOU TO DEATH. ANY COMMENTS FROM THE PUBLIC. ANY QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS IT DIDN'T YES WITH A STONE JUST WHAT I THINK ELIO MAKES A GOOD POINT. AND THAT THE INFORMATION IS FROM WHAT I'VE SEEN IS IT'S FAIRLY GENERAL AND FOR US TO BE ABLE TO APPROVE THIS I WOULD HOPE WE WOULD GET. A MUCH BETTER STANDARD OF WHAT WE'RE PROVING OTHERWISE IT SEEMS LIKE WE'RE BEING ASKED FOR A POT OF MONEY AND THEN BE TOLD WHAT IT'S BEING SPENT ON. WITHOUT KNOWING. REALLY UNDERSTANDING WHAT IT IS WE'RE GOING INTO AND SO I THINK FOR OUR OBLIGATES OUR OVERSIGHT OBLIGATION THE THINK IT WOULD BE. REALLY BENEFICIAL TO TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS WE'RE PROVING AND THEN OF COURSE. GET REPORTS BACK ON HOW IT'S BEING SPENT INTO IT SO WE CAN ENSURE THAT SPEAK OF BEING SPAT. IN THE WAYS THAT THAT WE WOULD HAVE PREDICTED SO I THINK SINCE IT DID DURING THE TIME IT IS BEING HELD OPEN IF WE GET SOME OF THAT INFORMATION. THAT DETAILS WHAT THE EXPECTATION IS WHY WE TO BE SPENDING MONEY WHERE IT'S GOING TO BE. EVERY PUBLIC AGENCY THAT I'VE BEEN A PART OF WHEN THE GROUP COMES BACK TO WHAT AND INTERNAL PARTNER COMES BACK TO THE BOARD OR COMMISSION WHATEVER IS MAKING THOSE DECISIONS USUALLY WE HAVE THAT INFORMATION. BEFORE MAKING THE DECISION AND THEN WE GET REPORTS AS ITS TRACKING SO THAT WE CAN UNDERSTAND EXPENDITURES THAT. I WOULD HOPE THAT THIS COMMITTEE WOULD HAVE ACCESS THAT INFORMATION AS WELL. ASSIST JONES SAWYER. I GUESS IS THE SECOND. WEEK THAT I'VE BEEN HERE. AND BUT THEN OUT NUMBER FIRST TIME WITH WITH WITH THE COURTS AND AND I'M. SCOTT PERPLEXING TO ME ID LIKE. I NEED TO FIND OUT WHO THE HELL DOES YOUR COST ESTIMATES BECAUSE IT DIDN'T SEEM LIKE ANYBODY COME IN ON TIME AND IF ANYBODY NEEDS TO BE FIRED IS THAT GROUP OR NEVER USE THEM AGAIN BECAUSE. SEEM LIKE DIFFERENCES BOTTOMLESS PIT. OF COMING BACK AND ASKING FOR MORE MONEY WHEN YOU GUARANTEE OR YOU SAY WE'RE GOING TO FINISH THIS HOUSE. AND. TWENTY NINETEEN AND THEN BROUGHT THE TWENTY TWENTY FOUR AND STILL ASKING FOR MORE MONEY. STILL WHILE LISTING OF EVER SEEN AND I'VE BUILT. A COUPLE OF. CITY SHACKS IN MY DAY. SO. I'M I'M WITH. MR STONE AND AND OTHERS ABOUT COMING BACK ABOUT COMING TO WORK TO LET US KNOW ON YOUR BEST ESTIMATE AND HOPEFULLY YOU DON'T USE THE SAME PEOPLE THEY GAVE YOU ORIGINAL ESTIMATE. BUT YOUR BEST ESTIMATES ON HOW YOU CAN BRING THIS TO A CLOSE AND HOW YOU CAN GET SOMETHING BUILT AND DONE. SO THAT I AM. IT'S MORE THAN OVERSIGHT IT'S IT'S LIKE COME. LIKE HAVING RESPONSIBILITY TO FINISH SOMETHING. IF YOU LIKE THE STATE. CAN'T QUITE GET THAT IS NOT MUCH. DOING YOU LIKE YOUR FRUSTRATION I HAVE WITH COURTS AND SOME OTHERS. SO UP I THINK WILL BE VERY VERY VERY IMPORTANT FOR THIS COMMITTEE. TAKE TO COME BACK WITH A AN OVERALL PLAN. ON HOW MUCH MORE MONEY YOU NEED WHAT YOU CAN AND CAN'T DO WITH THE MONEY YOU HAVE AND SO THAT WE CAN NAM. WE CAN MAKE THE BEST. DECISION THE BEST EDUCATED DECISION WITH TAXPAYER MONEY. INSTEAD OF. BUT I DON'T BE HERE I'M HERE FOR ANOTHER SIX YEARS I DON'T BE. THREE YEARS TALKING ABOUT THIS AGAIN. THE DOCTOR WEBER SOLA HOPEFULLY WEAKEN NAM. YOU GET SOME ANSWERS THAT WOULD BE GREAT. LET ME LET ME SEE IF I I I I IF I UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON. THIS ISN'T IT EVERY QUEST WOULD DISH NO DOLLARS. AND THEN YOU. PUT IT OUT TO BID AND THEN YOU FIGURE OUT WHAT IT'S GOING TO PAY FOR AND. DOES SOUND LIKE. THAT'S WHAT AND THEN WE FIND OUT HOW IT SPENT IS THAT. WHAT NORMALLY HAPPENS LIFT YOUR VISION OF WHAT OUGHT TO HAPPEN BUT I DIDN'T KNOW MEN TARA LET ME TRY TO EXPLAIN AS SIMPLY THE? PUBLIC WORKS. WHEN THE DEPARTMENT IDENTIFIES THAT THERE'S A COST TO INCREASE AND A NEED FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDING ON THE SIX FOOT PROJECTS WE HAVE TO PREPARE A REQUEST TO THE STATE PUBLIC WORKS BOARD THAT IDENTIFIES. WHAT THE NEEDS ARE WHAT'S CAUSING THE NEEDS ARE HOW THAT IMPACTS SCHEDULE AND ALL THE ABOVE AND THEN THE? PUBLIC WORKS BOARD WOULD A REVIEW THAT ACTION AND AND EITHER PROVE OR ASK QUESTIONS OR WHATEVER. THEY'RE THEY'RE. ACTION ON IT ON IT WOULD BE SO THESE PROJECTS ARE ALREADY ALREADY OUT TO BID RA AND THEY'RE UNDER UNDER CONSTRUCTION. SO BECAUSE THE BIDS WERE BASED UPON THE PLANS AS THE PLANS ESTABLISHED AT AT THE TIME OF BIDDING WHAT WE'VE FOUND IS THAT THESE PLANS OF HAD TO BE ADJUSTED BECAUSE OF POOR ACT IMPORT DUTIES BY THE ANY FIRMS IN THE FIRST PLACE. OR BECAUSE WE AND WE START RENOVATION AND AND THIS WHAT MAKES THIS PROJECT ESPECIALLY COMPLICATED IS THAT SOMETIMES WE'RE BUILDING BRAND NEW BUILDINGS ALL THE TIME FOR GOING INTO EXISTING BUILDINGS RENOVATING ADDING ON TO THOSE BUILDINGS. AND THAT'S WHEN WE FIND OUT THAT ONE THAT BUILDING WAS BUILT FIFTEEN YEARS AGO EVEN THOUGH THE PLAN SAY ALL THESE ITEMS WERE BUILT TO CODE. WE OPEN UP THE WALL AND YOU FIND IT'S NOT THERE AND HOW THE FIRE MARSHAL IN THE CONTRACTOR THAT TIME GOT THE BUILDING SIGNED OFF. I HAVE NO IDEA BUT THAT'S WHAT THE FIRE MARSHAL NOW HOLDS US TO TO REPAIR THAT SO IT'S NOT THAT WE ARE CHANGING THESE PROJECTS AS WE GO ALONG. IT'S THAT WE FIND THESE UNANTICIPATED CONSEQUENCES AND HAVE TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE CONTRACTOR TO WELL FIRST WE HAVE TO WORK WHETHER ANY FIRM TO DESIGN WHAT'S NECESSARY TO THAT HAVE THE CONTRACTOR. PRICE IT OUT IN NEGOTIATE WITH CONTRACTOR TO GET THAT ADDITIONAL WORK DONE. AND ALL THAT'S GOING TO BE NECESSARY BEFORE WE CAN HAVE A FIRE MARSHAL COME IN AND SAY YES THIS BUILDING IS READY FOR OCCUPANCY. SO THAT'S THE PHASE OF THESE PROJECTS THAT WERE IN THERE ARE AS A CONTRACTOR THERE AND WE ARE TRYING TO MANAGE AND MINIMIZE THESE. IMPACTS BUT WE AS THE EIGHTEEN AND A HALF PERCENT OF AUGMENTATION ALREADY IDENTIFIES THAT'S THE PROJECT WE'VE HAD IDENTIFIED TO GET TO THIS POINT. WE'VE IDENTIFIED ABOUT FOURTEEN OR THE PROJECTS THAT WE KNOW WILL NEED FUNDING AUGMENTATION SOMETIME IN THE NEXT SIX MONTHS. AND THAT'S PRIMARILY WHAT THIS MONEY IS FOR THAT WE WOULD BE GOING THROUGH THE PUBLIC WORKS BOARD TO GET THOSE AUGMENTATIONS APPROVED. A NOTE ON THE CONTINGENCY THE REASON WHY THERE IS CONTINGENCY BUILT IN THE SEVENTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS IS BECAUSE OUR INFORMATION FOR HOW MUCH MONEY WE NEED. IS ONLY AS GOOD AS EVERYTHING WE KNOW AT THE TIME THAT WE PUT THESE ESTIMATES TOGETHER SO BACK IN FEBRUARY WHEN WE DEVELOP THESE ESTIMATES. THE PHASE OF CONSTRUCTION WE ARE IN ALLOWED US TO KNOW WHAT OUR PROBLEMS WERE BUT IF THIS IS A BUILDING THAT HAS THREE OR FOUR MORE PHASES RENOVATION THAT WE HAVE AN OPEN THE WALLS ON YET. WE CAN ANTICIPATE THAT UNFORTUNATELY THERE MAY BE ADDITIONAL CHANGES. AND IF WE DIDN'T PUT MONEY FORWARD INTO THE PROJECT A INTO THIS REQUEST AT THIS POINT IN TIME. WE WOULD FIND THAT THE MONEY WE ASK FOR WOULDN'T BE SUFFICIENT TO GET US TO THE END. ANSWER WE MAY STILL FACE SITUATION FOR THE LEGISLATURE. APPROVED A THIRTY OR FORTY MILLION DOLLAR INCREASE ANY OF THE PROJECT MAY STILL HAVE TO A HALT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FISCAL YEAR INTEL A FURTHER INCREASE COULD COME THROUGH. THIS IS OUR EFFORTS TO BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY PUT MONEY ASIDE FOR THE UNKNOWNS WHICH IF THE ANNOUNCEMENT MATERIALIZE NEVER GETS APPROPRIATED BY THAT NEVER GETS ALLOCATED BY THE PUBLIC WORKS FOR TO US. AND STAYS IN THE APPROPRIATION BUT WE. AND MISTER JONES SAWYER MENTION WE DON'T WANT TO BE HERE AGAIN NEXT YEAR OR THREE YEARS FROM NOW ASKING FOR ADDITIONAL MONEY FOR THIS AND THIS WAS OUR BEST EFFORT TO PUT TOGETHER. THE AUGMENTATION WE FEEL IT'S NECESSARY TO COMPLETE THESE PROJECTS. IS IT POSSIBLE YOU CAN GIVE US THE UP. BOTH FOR THE MEMBERS THAT. PROJECT BY PROJECT IDENTIFICATION OF OF. THE AMOUNT THAT'S GOING TO BE SPENT AND WHY. INCREASED. WHICH I POSSESS THAT SHOOT SOME IT'S AVAILABLE A CREAM ON ROBERT'S APARTMENT FINANCE IT'S ACTUALLY WORKSHEETS WITHIN THE FINANCE LETTER SO. FOURTEEN OF THE PROJECTS IDENTIFIED THAT WE CAN GIVE YOU IS ANOTHER COPY OF THAT IT'S HELP YEAH THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL. YEAH AND ALSO IF I COULD JUST ADD REALLY QUICKLY THE M. SCOPE JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ON THE SAME PAGE THE SCOPE IS CONSISTENT WITH ALL TWENTY FIVE PROJECTS THAT WERE ESTABLISHED IN THE STATE PUBLIC WORKS BOARD WHERE AND THE SCOPE IS ALSO CONSISTENT WITH THE FUNDS. THAT WERE APPROPRIATE THROUGH BOTH AB NINE HUNDRED AND SENATE BILL TEN TWENTY TWO THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE. FOR THE HECK OF IT PROGRAM RIGHT ANY OF YOU ORIGINALLY GIVEN WHAT NINE HUNDRED MILLION. THE AND YOU'VE SPENT SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION APPROXIMATELY AT THIS POINT. YOU SPENT ALL. THAT WELL IT'S COMMITTED AYE I DON'T IT'S NOT REALLY ON A CASH BASIS PER SE BUT YES THE NINE HUNDRED MILLION IS FULLY COMMITTED PLUS ANOTHER HUNDRED AND FORTY SOMETHING. IN AUGMENTATIONS WHATEVER THE AMOUNT THAT WE ARE GONNA WAS NINE HUNDRED YES WE'VE DONE THE ONE SIXTY SEVEN AUGMENTATION YES. AND NOW WE NEED SEVENTY OR EIGHTY SEVEN MORE BUT WHAT SEVENTY THREE MORE AND THEN THERE'S THE AUGMENTATION AUTHORITY ATTACHED THAT SEVENTY THREE IF IF NECESSARY. SO IN THE END WHAT'S THE TOTAL. BUT RIGHT NOW WE'RE ONLY REQUEST IN SEVENTY THREE MILLION WE'RE NOT ASKING TO DIP INTO THE ADDITIONAL IT CAN GET TO EIGHTY SEVEN WE'VE ALREADY DONE THE ONE SIXTY SEVEN. CRACKED AND WE ALWAYS IN THE NINE HUNDRED WHICH IS IT'S ONE POINT ONE BILLION ONE. SO WE SPENT ONE POINT SIX BILLION THOSE ARE ONE POINT SIX BILLION RIGHT NOW. M.. NO NO ONE POINT ONE BILLION FOUR ONE ONE ONE POINT OH FOR IS WHAT THE ONE THE. NINE HUNDRED MILLION NINE HUNDRED MILLION THE ONE HUNDRED SIXTY SEVEN PLUS THE ADDITIONAL SEVENTY THREE REQUESTING WOULD YOU HAVE TO ONE BILLION FORTY MILLION DOLLARS. ALRIGHT I WISH I WAS IN THAT QUICK MATHEUS. OKAY TAKES A BREATH WAY YEAH YEAH I KNOW IT'S AMAZING. OKAY. ALRIGHT THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. LOT OF MONEY ALRIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. BRINGS TO ITEM NUMBER TWO. WHICH IS. YES AND THAT THAT ITEM WILL BE HELD OPEN. WELL YES EARLY EARTHQUAKE WARNING SYSTEM BUSINESS PLAN. OKAY GOOD TO SEE YOU ALL HERE JUST WANT TO SAY A COUPLE THINGS THAT THAT ARE IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE BEGIN. WE JUST RECEIVED RELEASE IDEA THIS FINAL BUSINESS PLAN ABOUT FIVE DAYS AGO. I AND WHICH DOES NOT INTO LARGE PLAN DOESN'T GIVE US MUCH TIME TO DIGEST ALL THAT'S IN IT. AN EARLY EARTH QUAKE WARNING SYSTEM CAN REDUCE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF HARM TO PEOPLE IN INDUSTRIES WHEN I CATASTROPHIC EARTHQUAKE HITS. SO WE DEFINITE ONE HAVE AN EFFECTIVE SYSTEM UP AND RUNNING. TO PROVIDE AS MUCH NOTICE AS POSSIBLE TO PEOPLE BECAUSE WE KEEP HEARING THE BIG ONE IS COMING. BUT IF THE DEVELOPMENT AND ROLL OUT IS NOT DONE CORRECTLY. I HAVE SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT THE EFFECT OF A SET OF SUCH A SYSTEM THAT DOESN'T HAVE THE CONFIDENCE OF THE PEOPLE OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE. UNDERSTAND THAT TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE BUT I HAD A GOOD BUDDY HASTY ROLLOUT DOESN'T MINIMIZE FALSE ALARMS. FIGURE OUT SUSTAINABLE FUNDING AND ADEQUATELY. ABOUT INFORMED PEOPLE HOW THE SYSTEM SHOULD BE USED A WE WILL HAVE MORE PROBLEMS THAN SOLUTIONS. FOR EXAMPLE I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE POTENTIAL LIABILITIES THAT MAY RESULT FROM A FALSE ALARM. THE WARNING GOES OUT A DOCTOR AND HOSPITAL STAFFS MEET SURGERY THE WARNING IN THE BEEN FALSE BUT MAYBE THAT SHORT DELAY HARMS THAT PATIENT ON THE TABLE. WHO BEARS WHAT RESPONSIBILITY IS AT THE HOSPITAL OR THE STATE? OR FALSE ALARM HAPPENS AND PEOPLE RUN OUT INTO THE STREETS AND CHAOS ENSUES. FOR THIS SUBCOMMITTEE TO WEIGH IN ON SUCH AN IMPORTANT PROJECT YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE IT IS DONE RIGHT. MINIMIZE AREAS TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND HOW TO USE IT WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE A WAY TO PAY FOR IT. YOU'VE GIVEN US VARIOUS OPTIONS TO PAY FOR IT BUT. AND THOSE. NO REAL RECOMMENDATIONS THE BUSINESS PLAN ANSWER SOME QUESTION BELIEVES OTHERS OPEN WHEN IT IS CONCERNED WHICH IS MOST CONCERN TO ME. FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S A TABLE POSSIBLE FUNDING SOURCES WOULD NOT A REAL DEAL OF ANALYSIS GREAT DEAL OF ANALYSIS. I'M EXPECTING THERE IS TO BE MORE INFORMATION AND RECOMMENDATIONS WE WAS EXPERTS OF WHAT IS THE MOST FEASIBLE I'M EXPECTING YOUR PRESENTATION TODAY TO ANSWER THESE CRITICAL QUESTIONS THAT WE HAVE CONCERNING THIS EARLY WARNING SYSTEM. OKAY OKAY THANK YOU. CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR HAVING US PACK AND. AS YOU INTRODUCED I'M HERE WITH MY COLLEAGUE RYAN ARBROATH WAS ALSO WITH CALLAWAY ES IN THE EARTHQUAKE PROGRAM. THE KIND OF BREAKDOWN THE BUSINESS PLAN WHAT IT INCLUDES IT IS A LARGE DOCUMENT WE REALIZE THERE ARE THE BEEN A LOT OF TIME TO TAKE IT ALL IN. AND THEN HOPEFULLY I'M ANSWER SOME QUESTIONS AT LEAST HELP US FOR THIS CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS IMPORTANT SYSTEM AND AND HOW WE PLAN TO. TO ROLL OUT IN CARRY FORWARD SO FIRST OF ALL THAT BUSINESS PLAN REALLY PAN COMES DOWN TO FOUR BASIC COMPONENTS IN THIS WAS DIRECTED FOR US TO CREEK TO CREATE BY STATUTE. OF ABOUT A YEAR OR SO AGO AND MANDATED WHAT IT SHOULDN'T. CLUED IN THAT IS ESTIMATES FOR WHAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE TO FINISH BUILDING THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT SUPPORTS THIS WARNING SYSTEM. AS WELL AS WHAT THE RECURRING COSTS ARE EXPECTED TO BE THAT CONTAINS IT IT WAS TO IT AT DIRECTED US TO. IDENTIFY SOME FUNDING OPTIONS FOR FORUM HOW WEEKS HOW WE PLAN TO CARRY OUT THE FUTURE. IT ASKED US TO LAY OUT A PLAN FOR HOW TO BE ROLLED OUT TO THE PUBLIC AND THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA AND THEN FINALLY IDENTIFY RISKS AND BENEFITS OF THOSE OF THE BASIC COMPONENTS OF IT. I THINK THAT. THE FUNDING. ESTIMATES FOR THE BILL DOWD AND THE RECURRING COSTS HOPEFULLY THAT SORT OF SPEAKS FOR ITSELF BUT IT BREAKS IT DOWN BY DIFFERENT COMPONENTS PART OF THAT INCLUDES WHAT WE'VE. WE'VE ASKED FOR IN THE IN THE BUDGET REQUEST FOR FIFTEEN POINT SEVEN FIVE MILLION WHICH IS TO COMPLETE THE INFRASTRUCTURE BUILD OUT FOR THE SEISMIC SENSORS THAT DETECT THE EARTHQUAKE. AND AND. INITIATE THAT EARLY ALERT TO. TO THE PUBLIC INTO CALIFORNIANS. IT ALSO CONTAINS IS YOU HAVE. AS YOU'VE NOTED THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF WAYS THAT IT COULD BE FUNDED ENOUGH IT'S OKAY I'LL GET BACK TO THAT. AND. IT TALKS ABOUT A TIME LINE FOR WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN WHEN FROM TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND GOING FORWARD TO ROLL OUT THE SYSTEM FOR REAL USE. AND THEN. THE VARIOUS RISKS AND BENEFITS OF AND THE PLAN KIND OF TAKING OUT ALL AND RECOMMENDS THAT CALLAWAY YES DO A FEW THINGS FIRST IT RECOMMENDS THAT WE. NEGOTIATE A FORMAL AGREEMENT WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT USE ANOTHER BIG PARTNER AND DEVELOPING THIS SYSTEM HAS BEEN FOR MANY YEARS. IT TALKS ABOUT US FINALIZING WHAT'S CALLED A TELEMETRY PLAN WHICH IS. A TECHNICAL TECHNICAL TERM FOR. HOW THE SENSORS IN THE GROUND SPEAK TO? YOU KNOW TALK TO THE INFORMATION NETWORKING GET THE ALERT OUT TO PEOPLE AND. IT IT TELLS US TO ACCESS TO WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON THE DIFFERENT FUNDING OPTIONS AND SO WERE ALREADY WORKING ON THOSE THINGS WERE NOT. WAITING NOW THAT THE BUSINESS PLAN IS OUT. WERE PROCEEDING AND I CAN SAY THAT WITH OUR PARTNERS IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THE UNITED STATES GEOLOGICAL SURVEY WE'VE ALREADY DEVELOPED A A DRAFT MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING THE TWO AGENCIES ARE WORKING THROUGH THAT RIGHT NOW. FORTUNATELY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT RECENTLY ALSO ALLOCATE IT'S MORE FUNDS THAT WILL HELP US BUILD THIS OUT IN CALIFORNIA. THAT'S TALKED ABOUT IN THE PLAN. BUT THERE'S A LOT OF. THINGS ARE COMING TOGETHER AND BOTH ENTITIES ARE VERY MOTIVATED TO MOVE FORWARD FORWARD QUICKLY BUT CAREFULLY AND WHICH IS WHY ON OUR ROLL OUT PLAN FOR TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND BEYOND. ITS TO DO THAT AND STAGES IT'S TO BUILD FROM WHAT'S ALREADY BEEN SUCCESSFUL THERE'S A LOT OF ENTITIES IN CALIFORNIA THAT HAVE BEEN TESTING THE SYSTEM SINCE TWENTY TWELVE I BELIEVE. AND SO WE WANT TO BUILDING CAPITALIZE ON THAT WHAT WORKS. YOUR POINT ABOUT RELIABILITY IS SPOT ON OF IT NEEDS TO BE SAFE IT NEEDS TO DEMONSTRATE THAT IT WILL WORK AND SO WE WANT TO BUILD THIS OUT OVER THE NEXT OUT OVER THE COMING YEARS. LEARN FROM THAT ROLL OUT AND FIX THINGS THAT NEED TO BE FIXED SO THAT WE CAN ENSURE THAT IT'S RELIABLE. THERE ARE SOME USERS WHERE THAT RISK IS PERHAPS LOWER. YOU KNOW AND. AB OR FALSE ALARM TOLERANCE MIGHT BE A LITTLE HIGHER THAT WOULD BE KIND OF ONE WAY WE WOULD LOOK AT ROLLING OUT STAGES SO THAT WE CAN. WORK OUT THINGS. BEFORE IT MOVES ON TO OTHER AREAS THAT MIGHT HAVE GREATER RISK WITH WITH FALSE ALARMS I'M IN TERMS OF THE FUNDING OPTIONS WHAT WAS IMPORTANT FOR US IN THE BUSINESS PLAN WAS TO IDENTIFY THE PROS AND CONS. OF DIFFERENT WAYS THAT THAT THIS COULD GO ON A FEW A FEW. YEARS AGO THERE WAS LEGISLATION THAT ACTUALLY DIRECTED CALLAWAY YES TO FIND NON GOVERNMENT FUNDS FOR THIS THAT WAS CHANGED. IN SUBSEQUENT PIECE OF LEGISLATION TO ALLOW SOME OF THE GENERAL FUND INVESTMENT THAT WE HAVE DONE BOTH IN TWENTY SIXTEEN AND WE'RE HOPING TO DO THIS YEAR. BUT REALLY LOOK FOR SOMETHING STABLE. YOU KNOW WHICH WHICH AT WHICH MIXES. PRIVATE SECTOR SOURCES AND OTHER THINGS AND ALSO A LINE WHERE IT MAKES SENSE WHERE WILL THE BENEFITS MY IN THE SYSTEM WHO WILL BENEFIT FROM AND HOW. AND THEN LINE UP POTENTIAL FUNDING SOURCES AGAINST THAT. THE DOLLAR AMOUNT IS PROBABLY VERY SMALL IF IT'S IF IT'S SPREAD ABOUT DIFFERENT FUNDING SOURCES IN TERMS OF WHAT EACH PERSON MIGHT EXPECT BUT WE WANTED TO BE CAREFUL TO REALLY. KIND OF LOOK AT THE PROS AND CONS AND LINE UP BENEFITS WITH THE COST OF ITS OF THAT MADE SENSE WHATEVER WE DID. AND SO NOW AND THAT'S ANOTHER AREA WERE ALREADY WORKING ON THAT WE'VE HAD. INFORMAL CONVERSATIONS WITH MANY INDUSTRIES ON THERE'S A LOT OF INTEREST IN THE SYSTEM WE'VE TALKED A LOT WITH. VARIOUS. INDUSTRIES ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF THE SYSTEM WE'VE SEEN IT WORK IN OTHER COUNTRIES WITH EARTHQUAKES THAT HAVE HAPPENED IN JAPAN WITH MEXICO CITY. AND SO THERE IS A LOT BEHIND THIS AND THERE'S A LOT OF INTEREST IN CALIFORNIA AND NOW ARE ARE ARE NOW THAT THE BUSINESS PLAN IS OUT OUR INTENT. IS TO NOW GO AND TAKE A DEEPER DIVE HAVE VERY DELIBERATE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT HOW WE MIGHT FIND THIS WITH DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES THAT. MIGHT BE ASKED TO FIND IT AND THEN WORK WITH YOU OF THE LEGISLATURE IN AND. IN SHORT ORDER TO IDENTIFY WHAT WHAT. WHICH OF THOSE MIGHT WORK IN AND GET THAT FINALIZED SO THERE'S A LOT THAT'S THAT'S MOVING FORWARD THE BUSINESS PLAN RELIGIOUS IS THAT. ARTICULATE SORT OF WHERE WE'VE BEEN AND WHERE WE'RE GOING AND. AND. YOU KNOW CALLAWAY ESSES COMPLETELY INTENTION ON ON MOVING FORWARD ON ON THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS AND WORK WITH YOU OKAY IN THE FUTURE. INCOME TO FINANCE FELLOW. MOWING CURSING AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WE DON'T HAVE ANY SPECIFIC CONCERNS ON THE FUNDING AMOUNT BUT. WE CAN CURRENT WHAT'S BEEN MENTIONED EARLIER BY THE CHAIR AND OTHERS. WE DO HAVE THE BUSINESS PLAN NOW HOWEVER THERE IS A LACK OF SPECIFICITY THERE IN TERMS OF. EXACTLY WHAT THAT MIX OF FUNDING SOURCES WILL BE ANSWERED OF WHAT HOW THEY SHOULD BE STRUCTURED AND. SO I THINK THERE'S THAT'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS GOING TO WANT TO CONTINUE TO MONITOR AND OVERSEE AND CERTAINLY PLAYS INTO THIS. BETTER QUESTIONS WHILE I'M WE THINK IT'S PROBABLY REASONABLE FOR THE GENERAL FUND TO BEAR A PORTION OF THE COST BECAUSE THERE'S PROBABLY THAT PROBABLY IS A GENERAL BENEFIT TO THE SYSTEM. BUT IT'S HARD TO TELL EXACTLY WHAT THAT BENEFITTED BECAUSE IT SORT OF WE HAVEN'T DONE. QUITE THE WORK NECESSARY TO REALLY ASSESS HOW MUCH IS GENERAL BENEFIT VERSUS BENEFIT FROM UP FOR THESE SPECIFIC INDIVIDUAL INDUSTRIES SO. I'M CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT. I THINK THERE'S CONTINUED WORK THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN BUT. WE DON'T HAVE ANY SPECIFIC CONCERNS WITH WITH THE PROPOSAL IS LAID OUT. ANY ITEM AND PUBLIC COMMENT. ANY QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS HERE DAVIS. DURING THE. PROPOSAL. OKAY SO OBVIOUSLY THERE LOT OF QUESTIONS THAT WE HAVE BEEN AND THAT. I WITH REGARDS TO. ESTABLISHING O. WHO THE PARTNERS ARE IN AND HOW MUCH RESPONSIBILITY THEY BEAR AND RESOURCES AND SO FORTH AND SO ON. YOUR REQUEST IS FOR WHAT AT THIS POINT SIXTEEN MILLION FIFTEEN POINT SEVEN FIVE FIFTEEN POINT SEVEN. OKAY AND. AND THAT'S JUST TO GET STARTED NO THAT'S ACTUALLY TO FINISH UP THE BUILD OUT OF THE SEISMIC STATIONS WE NEED ABOUT ELEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN. WE'VE GOTTEN ABOUT HALF OF THOSE FILLED WITH THE SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN BUDGET AUGMENTATION ABOUT SIX POINT FOUR MILLION. WAS PUT TOWARDS I'M GETTING THAT TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY THREE MORE IN THE GROUNDS ABOUT SEVENTY PERCENT COMPLETED SO THIS WOULD BE TO ACTUALLY COMPLETE THE SYSTEM BUILT OUT. AND AND IF I MIGHT THERE'S ALSO ANOTHER CAPITAL COMPONENT IN ADDITION TO THE SENSOR ROLL OUT I THINK THAT'S ANOTHER ABOUT SIXTEEN MILLION AS WELL. ON EVERYTHING A SIXTEEN BIT IN THIS PROPOSAL. AND SO THERE IS ANOTHER INFRASTRUCTURE COMPONENT COMING OUT RIGHT YEAH SO THIS IS THIS WOULD FINISH THE SENSORS AND THERE WOULD BE SOME ADDITIONAL CAPITAL COSTS AND THEN THERE'S. THIS PROPOSAL ALSO INCLUDES AN ONGOING COMPONENT OF ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND AS WELL THAT WOULD FUND THE STAFFING COSTS BUT THERE'S ALSO A EXPECTED TO BE SOME ADDITIONAL ITEMS. PRETTY AB BUT IT'S A SUBSTANTIAL ONGOING COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SYSTEM AND I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY THE BIGGEST COMPONENT. THAT WILL HAVE TO FIGURE OUT. AS PART OF THIS DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT THE ONGOING FUNDING SOURCES ARE GOING TO BE. SO THE ASSUMPTION IS THEM THAT YOU WILL OBVIOUSLY BE BACK FOR ADDITIONAL RESOURCES. WITH THIS PROJECT. WELL OUR TO OUR WE WE WANT TO DO NOW IS LOOK AT FUNDING OPTIONS THAT ARE PERHAPS NOT GOVERNMENTAL THAT CAN. FIND THE REST OF THE CAPITAL COST AS WELL AS THE RECURRING. BUT ALSO LEVERAGE WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS ABLE TO PROVIDE. AGAIN THEY WERE APPROPRIATED. THIS YEAR. SOME OF THAT MONEY IS GOING TO COME BACK TO CALIFORNIA THAT'S PART OF OUR AGREEMENT THAT WE'RE WORKING ON WITH THAT WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN LEVERAGE THAT TO THE. TO THE MAXIMUM SO THAT THE STATE DOLLARS IN FEDERAL DOLLARS ARE WORKING TOGETHER. OKAY. OKAY THANK YOU NO QUESTIONS. ALRIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. THAT ITEM WILL BE HELD OPEN. AND THAT BRINGS US TO THE AYE MEMBER ITEM THE. WE'VE. HEARD MISTER ONE OF THEM BECAUSE OF THE. THE CONCERN THAT OF ME HAD TO LEAVE WE HAVE WE HAVE FOLKS SIGNED IN. AND OUR FIRST SIGNING THIS WAS RADIUS. YES. WE GIVE EACH MEMBER ABOUT FIVE TO TEN MINUTES TO TELL US A PROJECT. AND. TWO THREE LINDA SO. OKAY YES. COMMEMORATE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. I FIRST WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE FOR TAKING THE TIME TO TRULY CONSIDER. THIS IMPERATIVE REQUEST. THIS REQUEST OF ONE POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS WOULD UPON PASSIVE PASSAGE OF AB THREE ZERO SEVEN SIX CREATIVE FONTS WHEN SURE THE CHILDREN AND FAMILIES. OF OUR TRIBAL COMMUNITIES WHO FIND THEMSELVES IN CHILD WELFARE RELATED CASES. HAVE LEGAL REPRESENTATION WHEN THEY CANNOT AFFORD IT. THIS IS CRUCIAL TO ENSURING THE CHILDREN ARE NOT BEING RIPPED AWAY FROM THEIR FAMILIES IN TRIBAL COMMUNITIES UNNECESSARILY. AND WILL INCREASE CALIFORNIA'S COMPLIANCE WITH A QUORUM STANDARDS. NATIONALLY THERE WERE TWO HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN APPEALED A COURT CASES OR INDIAN CHILD WELFARE ACT CASES IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO LEAD THE NATION IN IKORA. PEELS WITH ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY TWO OF THESE APPEALS THE SECOND STATE BEING ALASKA WITH SIX APPEALED CASES. ACCORDING TO THE ECHO COMPLIANCE TASK FORCE REPORT PRESENTED TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE ESTABLISHING THIS FUND WILL DRAMATICALLY DECREASE. THE APPEALS CALIFORNIA HAS RELATING TO INQUIRE AND TRIBAL CHILD WELFARE AND MORE IMPORTANTLY WILL PUT PROTECT CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES FROM UNNECESSARY HARM AND TRAUMA. I GREATLY APPRECIATE YOUR TIME AND HEARING THIS REQUEST AND YOUR CONSIDERATION IN ASSURING THAT THESE CHILDREN RECEIVE OPPORTUNITIES FOR JUSTICE WITH ME I HAVE DELIA SHARP. WITH A CALTRAIN TRIBAL FAMILIES COALITION TO SPEAK MORE ON THE ISSUE. THANK YOU AARON EFFECTIVE THINK THE AUTHOR FOR HER CONTINUED LEADERSHIP IN THIS AREA. AND I AM. CERTAINLY ALSO THE CHAIR OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE FOR HEARING THIS REQUEST I AM I AM THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CALIFORNIA TRIBAL FAMILIES COALITION WHICH IS THE SUCCESSOR ORGANIZATION TO THE CALIFORNIA EQUIP COMPLIANCE TASK FORCE WHICH WAS CONVENED. I'M AT THE INVITATION OF ATTORNEY GENERAL HARRIS IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN SPECIFICALLY TO LOOK ADEQUATE COMPLIANCE. AND THIS IS ONE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT THAT TASK FORCE MADE. UP IN THE REPORT IN THAT. THROUGH THE CURRENT ORGANIZATION WE CONTINUE TO FOLLOW UP ON. IN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT CONGRESS PASSED TO ACQUIRE THE INDIAN CHILD WELFARE ACT TO PROTECT THE INTERESTS OF TROUBLED CHILDREN AND PROMOTE STABILITY AND SECURITY FOR TRIBES AND THEIR MEMBER FAMILIES. HOWEVER STATE COURTS AND COUNTY AGENCIES CONTINUE TO ILLUSTRATE SERIOUS LACK OF COMPLIANCE WITH THAT PLAN. AB THREE ZERO THREE ZERO SEVEN SIX REQUIRES THE STATE BAR TO OFFER GRANTS TO QUALIFIED NONPROFIT LEGAL SERVICES ORGANIZATIONS. SO THAT ADEQUATE LEGAL SERVICES CAN BE PROVIDED TO INDIAN TRIBES AND CHILD WELFARE CASES WHERE THE INDIAN CHILD WELFARE ACT APPLIES. FUNDING CONSTRAINTS ARE ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS TRIBES LACK THE CAPACITY TO HANDLE IT WHAT ELIGIBLE CASES. CURRENTLY IN A CHILD WELFARE CASE. MOM AND DAD AND THE MINOR IN THE COUNTY ARE ALL APPOINTED COUNCIL THE TRIBE IS THE SOUL AYE AND REPRESENTED PARTY IN THOSE CASES OFTEN BEING REPRESENTED. BY A TRIBAL SOCIAL WORKER RATHER THAN AN ATTORNEY CREATING TREMENDOUS DIFFICULTY ACROSS THE SYSTEM. AUTHORIZING LEGAL ASSISTANCE TO TRIBES WILL INCREASE COMPLIANCE AND OVERALL REDUCE THE NUMBER OF APPEALS RELATED TO EQUIP CASES. THANK YOU THANK YOU ANY COMMENTS FROM ANYONE AUDIENCE. WE SHOULD NAME AND YOUR. WHETHER AND SUPPORTERS WANT TO HEAR THIS. YEAH POETRY ON BEHALF OF BOTH THE CHUNGA ANDCOLUSA INDIAN TRIBES ARE IN FULL SUPPORT OF THIS FUNDING. AS I HAVE. HAVE TALKED OTHERS BEFORE OF. THE GAMING TRAVELS TO THE GAMING TRIBES CAN AFFORD GOOD ATTORNEYS THEY HAVE IN HOUSE ATTORNEYS BUT FOR THE MAJORITY THE HUNDRED EIGHT TRIBES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THEY DON'T HAVE IN HOUSE ATTORNEYS WHO ACTUALLY CAN HELP THEM GET THROUGH THESE CASES. AND FOR THE INDIAN CHILDREN WE VERY MUCH ASK YOU TO PLEASE SUPPORT THIS BUDGET. KRISTIN PARA ALLIANCE FOR JONES WRITES IN SUPPORT. CHRIS LUNCH FROM CALIFORNIA TRIBAL BUSINESS ALLIANCE IN SUPPORT. ANY OTHER COMMENTS QUESTIONS. MEMBERS OF THAT IS THE QUESTION. OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR WITH THIS ITEM WILL BE HELD OPEN. OKAY OUR NEXT PERSON IS MISTER LACKEY ALRIGHT WELL THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND A COMMITTEE MEMBERS STAKE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT THIS TRAILER BILL. OF. WHICH WILL LOCK AND CONFORM TO CURRENT CALIFORNIA DO I LAWS WITH THE RECENT RULINGS MADE BY THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES. CALIFORNIA'S DO WHILE LAWS ARE CURRENTLY NOT A COMPLIANCE WITH THE DUE PROCESS REQUIREMENTS. SET FORTH BY THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES IN THE BIRCH FILLED VERSES NORTH DAKOTA CASE. THE COURT SAID THAT A STATE CANNOT ASSESS CRIMINAL PENALTIES FOR REFUSING A BLOOD TEST DURING A DUI ARREST. SO TO UPDATE THESE LAWS THIS TRAILER BILL REQUEST. ABSURD TO STREHLER BILL REQUEST WILL CONFORM CALIFORNIA'S IMPLIED CONSENT DO YOU WHY. A TO COMPLY WITH THE REQUIREMENTS SET FORTH BY THE COURT. THE LANGUAGE I'VE SUBMITTED FOR THIS FOR THE COMMITTEE'S CONSIDERATION IS STRICTLY TECHNICAL. AND ONLY CHANGES WHAT IS REQUIRED TO BRING US INTO COMPLIANCE WITH THE SUPREME COURT'S RULING. IT SIMPLY STRIKES CRIMINAL SANCTIONS FROM OUR CODES FOR REFUSING TO SUBMIT. TO A BLOOD TEST WHEN UNDER THE ARREST. WHEN UNDER THE REST UNDER THE SUSPICION OF A DUI. THE NEED TO UPDATE OUR OUR STATUTE IS IMPORTANT. UPDATING THE STATUE WILL ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT MOTOR VEHICLES TO UPDATE THEIR FORMS. WHICH LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS FILL OUT DURING AN ARREST. THIS WILL ENSURE STANDARDIZATION ACROSS ALL OF CALIFORNIA'S JURISDICTIONS SOFTWARES ARE COMPLYING WITH THE COURT'S RULING. MY OFFICE HAS INFORMED GOVERNOR BROWN'S ADMINISTRATION ABOUT THIS REQUEST AND THE PORTS ARE MAKING THIS CHANGE. I DID ATTEMPT UPDATE THE STATUTE LAST YEAR AND SOME OF THE BILL SEVEN OH TWO HOWEVER. THERE ARE ANCILLARY ISSUES OUTSIDE OF THE COURT'S RULING THE CONSTANT CONFUSION. THAT'S WHY I FEEL THIS IS AN APPROPRIATE STATUE CHANGE FOR BUDGET TRAILER BILL BECAUSE IT AS NOTED BEFORE. THIS LANGUAGE DOES NOTHING MORE THAN UPDATE THE STATUTE. THAT WERE INVALIDATED BY THE SUPREME COURT'S RULING. IT DOES NOT DELVE INTO THE OTHER ISSUES THE BOG DOWN A. B. SEVEN OH TO. AND I'M ABLE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. IF YOU WISH YOU HAD SOMETHING YOU WOULD LIKE TO AND I JUST BRIEFLY I SHOT UP WITH CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION WAS IN SUPPORT OF THE STATUTORY CHANGE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER LACKEY SAID THIS REALLY IS. S. CONFORMING CALIFORNIA LAW WITH WHICH REQUIRED NOW IN THE WAKE OF THE BURCHFIELD DECISION. APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT. ANY COMMENTS FROM THE PUBLIC. PUBLIC COMMENTS. MISSUS DONA QUESTION. I DO BECAUSE THEY'RE MEMBER YOUR SEVEN OF TWO AND THAT'S IN THE SENATE CORRECT. NO BUT IT IT NO LONGER HELEN'S YEAH GOT HELD ON SUSPENSE ó OKAY. BE I WASN'T EXACTLY SURE THE STATUS OF THAT SO BECAUSE IT SEEMS. STARTED THIS IS A DUMB QUESTION MAYBE BUT THIS SEEMS LIKE POLICY WHICH SHOULD THIS BE DONE THROUGH A POLICY BILL RATHER THAN BUDGET TRAILER BILL. SO. I GUESS WHERE WE HEAR AND WHAT'S THE WHAT'S THE DOLLAR ASSETS. NO THERE ISN'T THERE ISN'T REALLY A DOLLAR ASK OTHER THAN. THE DMV COST TO CHANGE THEIR FORMS. THAT THAT'S REALLY THE DOLLAR ASK NOW THAT THAT WOULD BE INVOLVED HERE BUT THE REASON WHY WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS PARTICULAR PROCESS IS BECAUSE. IT'S SIMPLER AND IT DOESN'T GET BOGGED DOWN IN ALL THE OTHER ACCUSATIONS THAT EXISTED WITH SEVEN OF TWO. AND BECAUSE WE REALLY NEED THIS REALLY QUICKLY. THERE'S AN URGENCY TO THIS OKAY BUT IF THAT. IF THIS WAS A COURT CASE THE SUPREME COURT CASE. THAT APPLIES THEN. THAT IT APPLIES IN THE IN THE LAW THAT THE STATE IS IS THE LAW. AND I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND IT WOULD CONCUR WITH WANTED TO CHANGE OUR STATUTORY SCHEME. BUT ANY COSTS THAT DB HAS ALREADY WHAT AT THAT THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO BEAR THAT COST. ANYWAY WHETHER WE CHANGE A STATUTE OR NOT. WOULD THAT BE BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO. APPLY. WITH THE SUPREME COURT CASE. WITHOUT THAT LAST YEAR. OKAY. YEAH I JUST DON'T. WHITE UNDERSTAND WHAT THE PUSHED BACK HIS FOR WHAT THE PROBLEM IS. AND IF THERE WHERE YOU INDICATED THERE WERE MORE ISSUES WITH YOUR BILL LAST YEAR THAN THAN WHAT'S BEING ASKED FOR HERE GAP OF WHEAT WE ALL WE GET IS TO COMPLETELY CHANGE THE STATUTE THE STUFF AND WE DON'T DO ANYTHING TO END FOR ANY OTHER. BUT THE ADVISEMENT THE WAY THE ADVISEMENT WAS GIVING THAT WAS. ALLEGING THAT THERE WAS GONNA BE MORE REFUSALS AND OF IT WAS VERY. HARD TO MEDIATE WRAP MY HEAD AROUND BUT THAT WAS THE ACCUSATION. IT'S HAPPENED YOU KNOW I I WAS JUST GONNA SAY IN IN SEVEN A TO THAT DEALT WITH MORE THAN JUST THE. CONFORMITY THE STATUE DID BRING INTO. THE WE TRIED TO KIND OF PRESCRIBE WHAT THE ADVISEMENT NEEDED TO BE THAT OFFICER GAVE. THAT CREATED SOME CONFLICT BOTH WITH CHP IS WALLS WITH DEFENSE BAR A THIS WOULD WOULD STRICTLY BE THAT THAT STATUTORY CHANGE. I THINK THE ISSUE THAT WAS RAISED BY DMV LAST YEAR WITH RESPECT TO THE COST OF OF UPDATING THIS FORMS. THE FORMS REFLECT WHAT THE STATUTE SAYS NOT NECESSARILY WHAT. SUPREME COURT CASE LAW SAYS. A AND SO THAT'S. THAT'S WHERE THE WHERE THE REBELS WITH WITH APPROPRIATIONS WAS. THE COST OF UPDATING THOSE FORMS. WAS PROBLEMATIC EDIT THE OF THE GIVE YOUR. ESTIMATED COST FOR THAT. I'M SURE THEY DID I DON'T RECALL OTHER RECALL WHAT IT IS YOU THAT BECAUSE I I THINK FOR US TO PASS SOMETHING. I'M NOT NECESSARILY AGAINST DOING POLICY IN BUDGET THIS. IT'S WHAT WE DO IS THAT WHAT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO DO BUT IT'S WHAT WE DO. BUT I THINK GETTING AN IDEA OF HOW MUCH WE'RE ASKING FOR THAT'S THAT'S THE THING THAT THAT. THAT I DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND SOUNDS LIKE A WORTHY PROBLEM TO SOLVE BUT GETTING THAT. GETTING THE NUMBERS RIGHT. AND. I DO UNDERSTAND DMV SAYS WHAT THE FORMS. MATCH WHAT THE STATUTE SAYS BUT IF THE STATUTE IS INFLUENCED BY THE SUPREME COURT SAY THIS IS WRONG THIS IS HOW YOU MUST ACT. I'M NOT QUITE SURE HOW THEY SAY OH WE SHOULD KILL THE POLICY BILL. BECAUSE IT COSTS THEM. MONEY THAT IT YOU ARE NOT SURE HOW IT HAPPENED BUT IT DID SO I OKAY OKAY SO I TO ME TO GO DOWN. TO US TO RATTLE HERE BUT I SAW THIS AND WAS TRYING TO. THE SONG HAS TOGETHER BECAUSE I THINK I REMEMBER SEVENTY TWO WHEN IT WAS WHAT THEY WANT. OUR HOUSE LAST YEAR BUT. OKAY INTERRUPTED SO SIMPLE. DOESN'T YET BUT TURNED OUT TO BE A LITTLE CYCLE GOING THROUGH HERE WE'RE GONNA NEED. TO UNDERTAKE OKAY WHAT THE MONEY IS I WOULD THINK IN ORDER FOR US TO BE MAKING A RECOMMENDATION. SUCH A FAT OUT OF ANY ONE ATTENDED THE APPS THAT WE'VE HEARD TODAY. THAT'S A FRACTION. SORRY SMALL AMOUNT. ALMOST WHAT I CAN TO AT I KNOW IT IS A PART OF IT AYE I'D. BUT THERE WAS SOME MONEY ATTACHED BUT ITS BASICALLY A POLICY ISSUE. AND SO I WAS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT ELSE WAS IN SEVEN ó TO THAT WAS THE HANG UP WAS AT THE. IF YOU TRY TO PRESCRIBE ADDITIONAL POLICY HAD TO DO WITH THE ADVISEMENT THAT'S THEN GIVEN. BECAUSE YOU HAVE. DIFFERENT PENALTIES FOR REFUSING THE CHEMICAL TEST VERSES THE OF THE BOOK THE BLOOD TEST VERSUS THE BREATH TEST. AND WHAT THAT NEEDED TO BE AND WHETHER WE SHOULD SPECIFY IN STATUTE WHAT IT IS OR SORT OF. TIME TO GIVE THAT THE KEY POINTS IN STATUTE AND LEAVE IT UP TO THE OFFICERS INTERPRETATION WHEN THEY'RE ACTUALLY GIVING THAT ADVISEMENT. AND THAT. YOU KNOW WE COULD MAKE ANYBODY HAPPY. SO I ASSUME THEN THAT THE THAT THE CURRENT THAT THE THE LANGUAGE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT NOW. WHICH IS ABSENT OF THOSE THINGS PROBABLY COULD GET TO POLICY RIGHT NOW. IT'S UNKNOWN. PERHAPS. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH WITH HIM THEY WOULD PROBABLY PASS POLICY MAY GET HELD. APPROACH ROADS NAMES WEBSITE IN WHICH WILL TELL THE LAST TIME RIGHT WHICH WHICH WHICH WHICH IS THE DISCONNECT BECAUSE IF THERE'S A SUPREME COURT CASE AND THIS IS HOW YOU WOULD ACT.

A READY FOR ME TO PROCEED YES WE'RE READY VERY GOOD THANK YOU. I'M THINK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY PRESENT ITS IMPORTANT BUDGET REQUEST ON BEHALF OF MYSELF AS WELL AS ASSEMBLY MEMBERS GRAY AND ASSEMBLYMAN AND SALAS. WE'RE REQUESTING FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO FUND THE PROTECT OUR HOMES PILOT PROGRAM WHICH WOULD ALLEVIATE HARDSHIP ON STRUGGLING CALIFORNIANS WHO MUST CHOOSE BETWEEN BASIC NEEDS AND HOME SECURITY. THIS MODEST AMOUNT OF MONEY WOULD PROVIDE CALIFORNIANS WHO QUALIFY FOR EITC AND THE COUNTIES OF KINGS CURRENT MERCED AND STAMINA DINO WITH GRANTS UP TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS TO PURCHASE HOME SECURITY EQUIPMENT. STUDIES SHOW THAT BURGLARY OCCURS MOST COMMONLY AND LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES WITH HIGH RATES OF UNEMPLOYMENT LEAVING THESE RESIDENTS PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE TO HOME INVASIONS. IN THE COUNTY SERVED BY THIS PROGRAM RESIDENTS EXPERIENCE POVERTY RATES WELL ABOVE THE STATE AVERAGE WHILE ALSO FACING HIGHER RATES OF BURGLARY. UNFORTUNATELY MOST SECURITY SYSTEM COST UPWARDS OF TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS FORCING RESIDENTS LIVING NEAR THE POVERTY LINE TO MAKE THE CHOICE BETWEEN HOME SAFETY. AND OTHER BASIC NEEDS TOOL THING SURE THE FAMILY SAFETY I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOU SUPPORT. YOUR SUPPORT AND FUNDING THE PROTECT OUR HOMES PILOT PROGRAM. FOR ANY COMMENTS FROM ANYONE IN THE AUDIENCE. MEMBERS. WITH DON'T. JUST A QUESTION SINCE THE CAPITAL EXPENDITURE WHICH IS WHAT YOU'RE ASKING FOR IS USUALLY A SMALL PART OF. THE REAL COST OF SECURITY SYSTEM. WHAT'S THE THOUGHT OF OF HOW DO THESE PEOPLE THAN PAY FOR THE MONTHLY COST THE CONNECTIONS THAT. THEY MAY OR MAY NOT EVEN HAVE ADEQUATE BROADBAND TO BE ABLE TO CARRY THE SIGNAL. SOS IS THIS HOW HOW DOES THIS WORK. WELL WHAT WE DO GOOD QUESTIONS THAT FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WE HAVE TAILORED THIS BILL DOWN FROM ITS ORIGINAL CONCEPT TO TRY AND FIT WITHIN THE BUDGET THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT FOR THE THE COUNTIES THAT WERE TRYING TO EXPAND THE PILOT PROGRAM FOR. I'M ORIGINALLY IN ITS. INCARNATION IT DID LOOK AT A LARGE AMOUNT THAT WOULD INCLUDE THE COST OF MONTHLY SERVICE AS WELL BUT AS TECHNOLOGY HAS EVOLVED WERE NOTICING THAT. I I DON'T MEAN TO SAY THIS IS THE NAME OF THIS COMPANY IS A PROMOTION FOR THIS PARTICULAR COMPANY BUT THERE ARE DOORBELLS NOW THAT HAVE AN ELECTRONIC ASPECT TO IT THAT CAN COULD. KEEP TRACK IN AND VIDEO RECORD WHO COMES TO YOUR DOOR THAT'S PROVIDED A GREAT LEVEL OF SECURITY THIS PRICE POINT THAT WERE LOOKING OUT ITS IS FULLY WITHIN THAT COST FACTOR. THERE'S NO ONGOING FEES THAT GO ALONG WITH THAT IF IT WAS A TRADITIONAL. YOU KNOW. HOME SECURITY COMPANY AND I WON'T SAY AND A BRAND BECAUSE I'M NOT SURE ADVOCATE FOR BRAND BUT USUALLY YOU'RE LOOKING AT RANGES BETWEEN TWENTY TO THIRTY FIVE DOLLARS PER MONTH. TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THAT SECURITY COMPANY A MONITOR YOUR SERVICE TO YOUR POINT ABOUT WHETHER THEY HAVE BROADBAND OR NOT EACH OF THESE COUNTIES. MY UNDERSTANDING IS A LOT OF THESE HOMES TO HAVE ACCESS TO LOW COST. INTERNET AND A LOT OF THESE. FAMILIES ALSO HAVE THE NEEDS OF THE INTERNET FOR THEIR CHILDREN FOR FOR THEIR WORK AT SCHOOL SO I WOULD BELIEVE THAT YOU KNOW ALL THOSE STARS ALIGNED THAT THIS WOULD BE A GOOD PROJECT. OKAY BECAUSE I MEAN THAT SOME OF THE SIGNALS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT DOES. DOES TAKE VIDEO IT'S GONNA TAKE VIDEO OUT OVER THE INTERNET WHICH. WHICH ASSUMES A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF. BI DIRECTIONAL DATA AND FOR A LOT OF THIS IS ONE OF THE FIGHTS WE'VE BEEN HAVING WITH. THAT TELECOM INDUSTRY IF YOU'RE ONLY TALKING IF YOU'RE LIMITED TO SIX MEGABITS DOWN ONE MINUTE MEGABIT UP. I'M NOT SURE HOW WELL THAT WORKS IN THAT ENVIRONMENT I DID SO I JUST TRY TO GET MY HEAD AROUND WHAT EXACTLY. WOULD BE ABLE TO BE PURCHASED ON THAT SAID. AND TO UNDERSTAND UTILITY BUT THANKS. OKAY. CRICKET AND ALSO THE THAT I THINK THE ONGOING TOSSES ALWAYS A VARIABLE AND SOMETIMES THESE AGENCIES WILL GIVE YOU FREE EQUIPMENT BECAUSE THEN YOU HAVE TO. PURCHASE THIS SERVICES FOR EVERY MONTH AS WELL AS PAID THE FEE TO THE. POLICE DEPARTMENT TO MONITOR YOUR HOME FOR THEM TO COME OUT THEY CHARGE YOU A A LICENSE FEE OR SOMETHING EVERY EVERY OF THE YEAR. RECESS NOW THAT'S THE ONES I HAVE TO ACCEPT IT BE INTERESTING BUT THIS IS SO SO THIS INVOLVES THREE DIFFERENT. AB MEMBERS YES THAT'S CORRECT MY MY. LARA GRAY AND WILL KNOW THIS ACTUALLY ASIDE THIS WOULD BE SALAS GROUNDS NINE DOLLARS GRAY AND MYSELF USE OF OKAY. ALRIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I PLEDGE NOT THREE BUT FIVE MILLION THAT'S CRACKED QUE ALRIGHT MISS EGGMAN THANK YOU VERY YOU KNOW WHO.
