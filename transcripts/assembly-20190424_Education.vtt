TEACHERS THAT WE ARE GOING TO

00:44:06.744 --> 00:44:09.747
NEED OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS --

00:44:09.813 --> 00:44:12.082
WE BE CURRENTLY THAT -- THAT

00:44:12.149 --> 00:44:13.117
SHORTAGE IS BEING FILLED BY

00:44:13.183 --> 00:44:14.752
TEACHERS WHO ARE LESS THAN

00:58:54.197 --> 00:58:55.999
CHILDCARE WHERE THERE'S LITTLE

00:58:56.065 --> 00:58:58.268
RISK OF LOSING ALL PUBLIC FUNDS

00:58:58.334 --> 00:58:59.435
TO PRIVATE ENTITIES THERE HAVE

00:58:59.502 --> 00:59:00.536

00:59:06.809 --> 00:59:09.212
SOMETHING THAT -- CDF I THINK A

00:59:09.279 --> 00:59:11.347
LOT ABOUT ENDS UP FIRST OF ALL

00:59:11.414 --> 00:59:12.348
WE PROVIDE STRONG TECHNICAL

00:59:12.415 --> 00:59:14.150
ASSISTANCE SO APPROACH A PROJECT

00:59:14.217 --> 00:59:15.652
WILL BE READY UNLESS WE KNOW IT

00:59:15.718 --> 00:59:16.986
HAS SOUND FINANCING.

00:59:17.053 --> 00:59:18.588
AND THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE

00:59:18.655 --> 00:59:20.356
THAT WE PROVIDE TO MITIGATE RISK

00:59:20.423 --> 00:59:23.192
ON THE OTHER END IS -- EXTREMELY

00:59:23.259 --> 00:59:25.561
IMPORTANT TO THE C. DFI AND

00:59:25.628 --> 00:59:27.730
THERE ARE OTHER OPTIONS AS WELL

00:59:27.797 --> 00:59:29.766

IN PHILANTHROPY TO PUT UP EQUITY

00:59:34.404 --> 00:59:36.406
THERE'S OTHER -- CREATIVE WAYS

00:59:36.472 --> 00:59:39.108
THAT WE CAN ENSURE THAT --

00:59:39.175 --> 00:59:40.543
THERE'S NO GIFT A PUBLIC FUND

00:59:40.610 --> 00:59:41.744
THE OTHER THING THAT I'LL SAY IS

00:59:41.811 --> 00:59:44.180
THAT IT IS VERY VERY UNLIKELY IN

00:59:44.247 --> 00:59:45.481
ALL THE WORK THAT WE'VE DONE

00:59:45.548 --> 00:59:46.582
WITH A LOW INCOME INVESTMENT

00:59:46.649 --> 00:59:48.418
FUND. TO HAVE ANY KIND OF

00:59:48.484 --> 00:59:50.253
DEFAULTS WE WE WORK REALLY

00:59:50.320 --> 00:59:51.955
CLOSELY TO ENSURE THAT THROUGH

00:59:52.021 --> 00:59:54.424
THE LOAN OR GRANT PROCESS.

00:59:54.490 --> 00:59:55.658
THE PROVIDER COMES UP MUCH

00:59:55.725 --> 00:59:57.627
STRONGER FROM A BUSINESS AND ON

00:59:57.694 --> 00:59:59.329
THE OTHER SIDE.

00:59:59.395 --> 01:00:00.430
WELL I GUESS Là THEY GIVE A

01:00:00.496 --> 01:00:02.532
HYPOTHETICAL AND GRANT IS TO BE

01:00:02.598 --> 01:00:04.100
NUKES HAVE BEEN GIVING LOANS OUT

01:00:04.167 --> 01:00:05.501
THEY WEREN'T AS ATTRACTIVE NOW

01:00:05.568 --> 01:00:06.769
THE A GRANT.

01:00:06.836 --> 01:00:09.172
AND THAT THE OTHER THING IS IF

01:00:09.238 --> 01:00:10.540
HAVING PROPER REIMBURSEMENT FOR

01:00:10.606 --> 01:00:11.774

01:14:52.354 --> 01:14:54.189
NUMBER OF REASONS WE ARE PARK

01:14:54.256 --> 01:14:54.890

WE HAVE OVER ALMOST TWO MILLION

01:14:56.825 --> 01:14:58.827

01:15:01.864 --> 01:15:02.998
THE SAME COULD BE SAID ABOUT

01:15:03.065 --> 01:15:05.500
ANAHEIM BAKERSFIELD FRESNO THE

FOR THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE

01:15:10.572 --> 01:15:11.206
CHANGE.

THAT MEANS NO TREE CANOPY THAT

01:15:13.041 --> 01:15:14.376

01:15:14.443 --> 01:15:16.211
SEVERE FLOODING IN THE IMPACTS

01:15:16.278 --> 01:15:18.247

MAJORITY OF KIDS AND UNDERSERVED

01:15:25.787 --> 01:15:27.623

01:15:27.689 --> 01:15:30.058
OPPORTUNITY TO BE OUTSIDE.

01:15:30.125 --> 01:15:31.894
THEIR OWN NEIGHBORHOOD IS EITHER

01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:32.995
AND ACCESSIBLE BECAUSE THEY'RE

01:15:33.061 --> 01:15:34.062
IN APARTMENTS OR IT'S TOO

01:15:34.129 --> 01:15:36.498
DANGEROUS FRANKLY TO BE OUTSIDE.

01:15:36.565 --> 01:15:38.634
AND IF YOU CAN'T GO OUTSIDE

01:15:38.700 --> 01:15:40.435
BECAUSE IT'S TOO HOT BECAUSE

THERE'S NO WHERE TO PLAY OR A

01:15:42.571 --> 01:15:44.907
BECAUSE THERE'S NO SHADE -- IT

01:15:44.973 --> 01:15:47.075
REALLY LEADS -- TO INESCAPABLE

01:15:47.142 --> 01:15:48.710
SITUATION FOR KIDS NOT TO HAVE

MORE ACCESS TO PARKS YOU CAN DO

01:16:02.424 --> 01:16:04.226

01:16:34.990 --> 01:16:36.158
THE ONLY NEIGHBORHOOD LAND TRUST

01:16:36.224 --> 01:16:37.259
IS A COMMUNITY BASED

01:16:37.326 --> 01:16:39.027
ORGANIZATION WE OPERATE OUT OF

01:16:39.094 --> 01:16:40.062
LA COUNTY.

AND DAY IN AND DAY OUT WE'RE

01:16:41.630 --> 01:16:43.031
GRAPPLING WITH THIS ISSUE.

01:16:43.098 --> 01:16:45.367
EVEN WHEN YOU PUT -- AS THE

ALWAYS ABOUT THE MONEY.

01:16:56.611 --> 01:16:58.847
IT'S ABOUT TRYING TO FIND SPACES

01:16:58.914 --> 01:17:00.716

ACT.

01:23:55.630 --> 01:23:56.564
SUCH STUDENTS WERE OFTEN VICTIMS

01:23:56.631 --> 01:23:57.599

PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS HOWEVER.

01:24:04.272 --> 01:24:05.039
BECAUSE MANY OF THOSE WARNING

01:26:10.899 --> 01:26:12.467
OVER THE LAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS

01:26:12.534 --> 01:26:14.235
RESEARCH HAS REVEALED THAT AND

01:26:14.302 --> 01:26:15.436
SEVEN OUT OF TEN ACTS OF GUN

01:26:15.503 --> 01:26:17.171
VIOLENCE IN AND FOUR OUT OF FIVE

01:26:17.238 --> 01:26:18.206
SCHOOL SHOOTINGS.

01:26:18.273 --> 01:26:19.774
THE ATTACKER HAD TOLD PEOPLE OF

01:26:19.841 --> 01:26:21.776
HIS PLANS AHEAD OF TIME WE KNOW

01:26:21.843 --> 01:26:23.111
THAT IN THE VAST MAJORITY OF

01:26:23.177 --> 01:26:25.146
CASES PEOPLE AT RISK OF HURTING

01:26:25.213 --> 01:26:27.215
THEMSELVES OR OTHERS SHOW SIGNS

01:26:27.282 --> 01:26:29.217
AND SIGNALS BEFORE THE ACT OF

01:26:29.284 --> 01:26:30.552
VIOLENCE TAKES PLACE.

01:26:30.618 --> 01:26:32.720
AND LET ME BE CLEAR THE TYPES OF

01:26:32.787 --> 01:26:34.222
THREAT REQUIRING INTERVENTION GO

01:26:34.289 --> 01:26:36.024
WELL BEYOND THE PROSPECT OF A

01:26:36.090 --> 01:26:37.125
MASS SHOOTING.

01:26:37.191 --> 01:26:38.560
AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN STUDENTS

01:26:41.563 --> 01:26:43.531
THREE VICTIMIZATION PER ONE

01:26:43.598 --> 01:26:44.299
THOUSAND STUDENTS.

01:26:44.365 --> 01:26:45.900
THIS STATISTIC IS NOT THE NUMBER

01:26:45.967 --> 01:26:47.969
OF THREATS MADE BUT ACTUATED

01:26:48.036 --> 01:26:52.640
VIOLENCE THAT OCCURRED IN OUR

01:26:52.707 --> 01:26:53.541
SCHOOLS.

01:26:53.608 --> 01:26:54.175
WHEN YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT TO LOOK

01:26:54.242 --> 01:26:55.343
FOR IT CAN BE EASY TO DISMISS

01:26:55.410 --> 01:26:56.177
THE SIGNS AND MORE OFTEN THE

01:26:56.244 --> 01:26:58.279
CASE IN OUR SCHOOLS WHEN YOU SEE

01:26:58.346 --> 01:26:59.414
THE SIGNS?

01:26:59.480 --> 01:27:00.949
BUT DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO ABOUT

01:27:01.015 --> 01:27:02.984
IT WELL THE CONSEQUENCES OF THAT

01:27:03.051 --> 01:27:04.485
CAN BE TRAGIC.

01:27:04.552 --> 01:27:05.820

01:27:05.887 --> 01:27:07.288

FIRST ADULT THAT CAME IN CONTACT

WITH THEM WAS A SCHOOL MONITOR.

01:28:14.055 --> 01:28:15.356
THE SCHOOL MONITOR IMMEDIATELY

01:28:15.423 --> 01:28:18.326
RECOGNIZED THIS BOY NOT BY HIS

01:28:18.393 --> 01:28:21.029

LIKELY BY THE FACULTY TO SHOOT

01:28:25.099 --> 01:28:26.100
AT THE SCHOOL.

01:28:26.167 --> 01:28:27.735
THAT'S UNACCEPTABLE THAT TWENTY

01:28:27.802 --> 01:28:29.170
YEARS LATER WE HAVEN'T

01:28:29.237 --> 01:28:30.471
COLLECTIVELY.

01:28:30.538 --> 01:28:32.740
LEARNED THAT THERE IS BEHAVIORS

01:28:32.807 --> 01:28:36.644
THAT CAN BE READILY IDENTIFIED

01:28:36.711 --> 01:28:37.578
THAT.

01:28:37.645 --> 01:28:38.413
VEAL THAT SOMEONE MAY BE ON THE

01:28:38.479 --> 01:28:40.014
PATHWAY TO VIOLENCE SUCH AS THIS.

01:28:40.081 --> 01:28:41.716
UPS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA MUCH

01:28:41.783 --> 01:28:42.483
LIKE THROUGHOUT THE UNITED

01:28:42.550 --> 01:28:44.152
STATES.

01:28:44.218 --> 01:28:44.652
THIS THREAD ASSESSMENT

01:28:44.719 --> 01:28:45.887
APPROACHED.

01:28:45.953 --> 01:28:47.455
HAS BEEN INCREASINGLY

01:28:47.522 --> 01:28:49.057
IMPLEMENTED IN VARIOUS --

01:28:49.123 --> 01:28:51.826
JURISDICTIONS WHAT SEVENTEEN

01:28:51.893 --> 01:28:52.493
TWENTY TWO DOES AND THE WAY IT'S

01:28:52.560 --> 01:28:55.463
DRAFTED IS TO TRY TO TO ENABLE

01:28:55.530 --> 01:28:57.699
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AS IN A

01:28:57.765 --> 01:29:00.068
COMPREHENSIVE WAY TO SET FORTH A

01:29:00.134 --> 01:29:02.070
STANDARDIZED PROTOCOL NOT THE

01:29:02.136 --> 01:29:03.871
SPECIFIC DETAILS OF HOW IT'LL BE

01:29:03.938 --> 01:29:05.339
IMPLEMENTED AN INDIVIDUAL

01:29:05.406 --> 01:29:06.140
JURISDICTION.

01:29:06.207 --> 01:29:08.810
BUT A VERY SPECIFIC YOU NEED TO

01:29:08.876 --> 01:29:11.279
PLAN TO DO THIS AND YOU NEED TO

01:29:11.345 --> 01:29:14.682
USE EVIDENCE BASED.

01:29:14.749 --> 01:29:17.118
BEST PRACTICES WHICH A LOOK TO

01:29:17.185 --> 01:29:17.785
BEHAVIORS THAT ARE IDENTIFIED --

01:29:17.852 --> 01:29:19.153
WELL IN ADVANCE.

01:29:19.220 --> 01:29:21.556
WE IN CALIFORNIA SHOULD NOT WAIT

01:29:21.622 --> 01:29:22.590
UNTIL THERE'S ANOTHER HOT HOT

01:29:22.657 --> 01:29:24.125
HIGH PROFILE INCIDENT TO TAKE

01:29:24.192 --> 01:29:26.327
PLACE BEFORE WE TAKE ACTION ON

01:29:26.394 --> 01:29:27.795
SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

01:29:27.862 --> 01:29:28.796
AND WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO

01:29:28.863 --> 01:29:30.865
ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS I WOULD

01:29:30.932 --> 01:29:32.533
DEFER BACK.

01:29:32.600 --> 01:29:43.478
TO THANK YOU ANY SPEAKERS IN

CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF SCHOOL

01:29:49.584 --> 01:29:50.785
ANY SPEAKERS ANY ADDITIONAL

01:29:50.852 --> 01:29:52.687

BEHALF OF THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA.

01:30:08.903 --> 01:30:10.104
I'M FIRST LET ME THANK THE

01:30:10.171 --> 01:30:11.672
AUTHOR AND HIS STAFF ON A AND

01:30:11.739 --> 01:30:12.840
THE SUPPORTERS OF THE BILL FOR

01:30:12.907 --> 01:30:14.442
THEIR WILLINGNESS TO MEET AND

01:30:14.509 --> 01:30:16.544
TALK TO US ABOUT OUR CONCERNS --

01:30:16.611 --> 01:30:18.379
UNFORTUNATELY WE DON'T BELIEVE

01:30:18.446 --> 01:30:20.081
WE'RE YET AT THE POINT OF HAVING

01:30:20.148 --> 01:30:21.582
REACHED AGREEMENT ON WHAT WOULD

01:30:21.649 --> 01:30:23.885
BE NEEDED IN THIS LEGISLATION TO

01:30:23.951 --> 01:30:25.052
ALLOW SCHOOLS TO EFFECTIVELY

01:30:25.119 --> 01:30:26.287
ASSESS THREATS.

01:30:26.354 --> 01:30:28.422
WHILE ENSURING EQUITY AND

01:30:28.489 --> 01:30:29.657
PROTECTING STUDENTS RIGHTS.

01:30:29.724 --> 01:30:31.125
WE ALL AGREE ON THE GOAL OF

01:30:31.192 --> 01:30:32.293
SAFER SCHOOLS AND THAT WE SHOULD

01:30:32.360 --> 01:30:33.461
WORK TO PREVENT VIOLENT

01:30:33.528 --> 01:30:34.962
INCIDENTS RATHER THAN JUST

01:30:35.029 --> 01:30:36.664
REACTING WHEN THEY OCCUR.

01:30:36.731 --> 01:30:37.131
WELL THE USE OF THREAT

01:30:37.198 --> 01:30:38.933
ASSESSMENTS TWO TEAMS TO ASSESS

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:40.468
AND RESPOND TO POTENTIAL THREATS

01:30:40.535 --> 01:30:41.869
OF VIOLENCE CAN BE EFFECTIVE IN

01:30:41.936 --> 01:30:43.070
PREVENTING SCHOOL VIOLENCE AND

01:30:43.137 --> 01:30:44.372
CAN BE DONE IN A WAY THAT

01:30:44.438 --> 01:30:46.440
PROTECTS STUDENT RIGHTS.

01:30:46.507 --> 01:30:47.775
THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS.

01:30:47.842 --> 01:30:49.143
WHEN THREAT ASSESSMENT TEAMS DO

01:30:49.210 --> 01:30:50.578
NOT HAVE ADEQUATE REPRESENTATION

01:30:50.645 --> 01:30:51.913
OF MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS

01:30:51.979 --> 01:30:53.014
AND INSTEAD HAVE AN OVER

01:30:53.080 --> 01:30:54.615
REPRESENTATION OF LAW

01:30:54.682 --> 01:30:55.950
ENFORCEMENT PERSONNEL?

01:30:56.017 --> 01:30:57.685
AND WHEN THE STATUTORY FRAMEWORK

01:30:57.752 --> 01:30:58.786
FOR THREAT ASSESSMENT PROCEDURES

01:30:58.853 --> 01:31:00.588
DOES NOT EXPLICITLY PROVIDE

01:31:00.655 --> 01:31:02.890
PROTECTIONS FOR STUDENT RIGHTS.

01:31:02.957 --> 01:31:04.458
IT IS ALL TOO EASY FOR THE WORK

01:31:04.525 --> 01:31:06.227
OF A THREAT ASSESSMENT TEAM TO

01:31:06.294 --> 01:31:07.562
BECOME ONE MORE WAY THAT PUSHES

01:31:07.628 --> 01:31:09.664
STUDENTS OUT OF SCHOOL AND INTO

01:31:09.730 --> 01:31:11.132
THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM.

01:31:11.199 --> 01:31:12.433
RATHER THAN PROVIDING WITH THEM

01:31:12.500 --> 01:31:13.935
WITH THE SUPPORT AND SERVICES

01:31:14.001 --> 01:31:14.936
THEY NEED.

01:31:15.002 --> 01:31:16.204
SCHOOL CLIMATE CAN BE HARMED IF

01:31:16.270 --> 01:31:17.471
STUDENTS FEEL THEY MAY BE

01:31:17.538 --> 01:31:19.240
UNFAIRLY TARGETED FOR DISCIPLINE

01:31:19.307 --> 01:31:20.474
OR EVEN LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:31:20.541 --> 01:31:22.343
INTERVENTION ON THE BASIS OF

01:31:22.410 --> 01:31:23.744
ANONYMOUS REPORTS.

01:31:23.811 --> 01:31:25.513
WITHOUT ADEQUATE SAFEGUARDS THE

01:31:25.580 --> 01:31:26.480
OUTCOMES OF THE THREAT

01:31:26.547 --> 01:31:28.049
ASSESSMENTS WILL LIKELY HAVE A

01:31:28.115 --> 01:31:29.817
DISPARATE IMPACT ON STUDENTS OF

01:31:29.884 --> 01:31:31.786
COLOR AND STUDENTS WITH

01:31:31.853 --> 01:31:32.687
DISABILITIES.

01:31:32.753 --> 01:31:33.988
UNFORTUNATELY IN CALIFORNIA

01:31:34.055 --> 01:31:35.289
SCHOOLS TODAY WE KNOW THAT

01:31:35.356 --> 01:31:37.124
MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES STAFFING

01:31:37.191 --> 01:31:38.593
IS WOEFULLY INADEQUATE.

01:31:38.659 --> 01:31:40.061
MANY SCHOOLS HAVE A SCHOOL

01:31:40.127 --> 01:31:41.462
RESOURCE OFFICER BUT NOPE

01:31:41.529 --> 01:31:42.797
COUNSELORS WHATSOEVER.

01:31:42.864 --> 01:31:44.265
IN THIS ENVIRONMENT AND

01:31:44.332 --> 01:31:45.233
ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE LACK OF

01:31:45.299 --> 01:31:46.567
EXPLICIT PROTECTIONS IN THE

01:31:46.634 --> 01:31:49.070
LANGUAGE OF AB SEVENTEEN TWENTY

01:31:49.136 --> 01:31:49.871
TWO THE THREAT ASSESSMENT TEAMS

01:31:49.937 --> 01:31:51.372
REQUIRED UNDER THE BILL WILL ALL

01:31:51.439 --> 01:31:52.707
TOO LIKELY HAVE AN OVERALL

01:31:52.773 --> 01:31:55.309
HARMFUL EFFECT ON SCHOOL CLIMATE.

01:31:55.376 --> 01:31:56.677
AS A STARTING POINT WE BELIEVE

01:31:56.744 --> 01:31:58.546
THAT ANY LEGISLATION REQUIRING

01:31:58.613 --> 01:31:59.614
THREAT ASSESSMENT TEAMS MUST

01:31:59.680 --> 01:32:00.348
HAVE CERTAIN SPECIFIC

01:32:00.414 --> 01:32:01.816
PROTECTIONS SET OUT IN THE

01:32:01.883 --> 01:32:03.050
LANGUAGE OF THE BILL.

01:32:03.117 --> 01:32:04.785
MOST THREATS ARE STE TRANSIENT

01:32:04.852 --> 01:32:05.653
AND THE THREAT ASSESSMENT

01:32:05.720 --> 01:32:06.721
PROCEDURES SHOULD HAVE THE GOAL

01:32:06.787 --> 01:32:09.357
OF KEEPING STUDENTS IN SCHOOL

01:32:09.423 --> 01:32:10.892
WHENEVER POSSIBLE.

01:32:10.958 --> 01:32:11.459
PEARLS TO THREAD ASSESSMENT

01:32:11.525 --> 01:32:13.461
TEAMS SHOULD ONLY OCCUR WHEN

01:32:13.527 --> 01:32:14.729
THERE IS A REASONABLE BASIS TO

01:32:14.795 --> 01:32:16.264
CONCLUDE THAT THE STUDENT HAS

01:32:16.330 --> 01:32:17.398
ENGAGED IN CONDUCT THAT

01:32:17.465 --> 01:32:18.432
INDICATES A THREAT.

01:32:18.499 --> 01:32:19.700
THE STUDENT AND STUDENTS PARENTS

01:32:19.767 --> 01:32:20.835
SHOULD RECEIVE WRITTEN NOTICE

01:32:20.902 --> 01:32:22.904
WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS OF A

01:32:22.970 --> 01:32:23.537
REFERRAL TO A THREAT ASSESSMENT

01:32:23.604 --> 01:32:24.405
TEAM.

01:32:24.472 --> 01:32:26.073
PROTECTIONS MUST BE PUT IN PLACE

DISCIPLINE IN MOST CASES.

01:33:28.536 --> 01:33:30.037

PRIOR TO PARKLAND TAKING PLACE.

FLORIDA DID NOT HAVE A

01:36:14.168 --> 01:36:14.768
COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH A SET OF

01:36:14.835 --> 01:36:15.503
STANDARDS THAT USE BEST

01:36:15.569 --> 01:36:16.837

MANAGEMENT TEAM SUCH A CORPORATE

01:36:32.453 --> 01:36:33.053
TALKING ABOUT.

CAMPUS -- ABOUT THE STUDENT AND

01:36:39.660 --> 01:36:40.961
HE REFUSED TO RELEASE THAT

01:36:41.028 --> 01:36:42.062
INFORMATION BECAUSE HE WAS

01:36:42.129 --> 01:36:43.030
CONCERNED THAT IT WAS LAW

01:36:43.097 --> 01:36:44.465
ENFORCEMENT SENSITIVE.

01:36:44.532 --> 01:36:45.933
AND HE WOULDN'T REALLY SAID HE

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:49.470
HAD NOT BEEN PROPERLY TRAINED --

01:36:49.537 --> 01:36:53.440
AND IN THE LIST GOES ON AND ON

01:36:53.507 --> 01:36:54.008
AND ON THE PROBLEM WITH IT.

01:36:54.074 --> 01:36:55.442
LET ME GIVE ME ONE OF THE WORST

01:36:55.509 --> 01:36:56.110
ONES I DON'T KNOW BURKE MOST THE

01:36:56.177 --> 01:36:57.044
PUBLIC IS UNAWARE.

01:36:57.111 --> 01:36:58.979
THAT THE FIRST PEOPLE THIS IS --

01:36:59.046 --> 01:37:00.281
PARK WHEN DID LOCATION THAT HIGH

01:37:00.347 --> 01:37:02.116
SCHOOL IS ACTUALLY IN BROWARD

01:37:02.183 --> 01:37:03.517
COUNTY IT WAS A BROWARD COUNTY

01:37:03.584 --> 01:37:05.186
SHERIFF'S DEPUTY WHO IS A SCHOOL

01:37:05.252 --> 01:37:06.754
RESOURCE OFFICER.

01:37:06.820 --> 01:37:07.755
THE FIRST POLICE OFFICERS THAT

01:37:07.821 --> 01:37:09.657
ENTERED THAT CAMPUS AFTER THE

01:37:09.723 --> 01:37:11.425
SHOOTING BEGAN -- WERE FROM

01:37:11.492 --> 01:37:12.993
CORAL SPRINGS A NEIGHBORING

01:37:13.060 --> 01:37:15.162
JURISDICTION THAT WOULD NOT WAIT

01:37:15.229 --> 01:37:16.630
THAT IS THE STANDARD PRACTICE

01:37:16.697 --> 01:37:18.098
THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO ENTER IN

01:37:18.165 --> 01:37:19.667
BROWARD COUNTY BECAUSE OF THE

01:37:19.733 --> 01:37:20.467
DYSFUNCTION NOW THAT HE WITH AND

01:37:20.534 --> 01:37:21.535
THAT SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT.

01:37:21.602 --> 01:37:23.103
DID NOT PROPERLY HANDLE THAT

01:37:23.170 --> 01:37:25.039
SITUATION THE BILL LAST YEAR

01:37:25.105 --> 01:37:26.607
READ RODRIGUEZ IS A VERY GOOD

01:37:26.674 --> 01:37:28.542
FROM ASSEMBLY MEMBER RODRIGUEZ

01:37:28.609 --> 01:37:29.710
IT'S A VERY GOOD BILL.

01:37:29.777 --> 01:37:31.879
BUT THROUGHOUT MY CAREER TWENTY

01:37:31.946 --> 01:37:33.380
SEVEN YEARS OF DOING THIS WHAT I

01:37:33.447 --> 01:37:34.248
HAVE SEEN OVER AND OVER AGAIN IS

01:37:34.315 --> 01:37:37.484
WE REACT TO THINGS AFTER THE THE

01:37:37.551 --> 01:37:39.987
CRISIS AS A BEGUN -- AFTER THE

01:37:40.054 --> 01:37:41.889
FIRST SHOT HAS BEEN FIRED WITH

01:37:41.956 --> 01:37:43.857
THIS APPROACH IS IS TO TAKE IT

01:37:43.924 --> 01:37:45.960
BACK AND MOVE THE TIMELINE BACK

01:37:46.026 --> 01:37:47.995
AND TRY TO INTERCEDE BEFORE IT

01:37:48.062 --> 01:37:50.898
EVER GETS TO THAT POINT -- AIMED

01:37:50.965 --> 01:37:52.066
AT RODRIGUEZ IS BILL OUT OF ALL

01:37:52.132 --> 01:37:53.434
THE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT AGAIN

01:37:53.500 --> 01:37:55.502
IT GOES TO WHAT DO YOU DO AFTER

01:37:55.569 --> 01:37:57.471
THE FIRST SHOT HAS BEEN FIRED --

01:37:57.538 --> 01:37:59.206
THE IMPORTANT THING I THINK BE A

01:37:59.273 --> 01:38:00.608
BOB EVERYTHING ELSE IS

01:38:00.674 --> 01:38:02.042
CALIFORNIA SHOULD ADOPT A

01:38:02.109 --> 01:38:04.144
STANDARD ONE THAT WE CAN WORK

01:38:04.211 --> 01:38:05.813
OUT THAT AT RENT RECONCILES

01:38:05.879 --> 01:38:07.581
PRIVACY CONCERNS WHAT GOES IN A

01:38:07.648 --> 01:38:09.316
CHILD'S ACUMEN FILE ALL OF THOSE

01:38:09.383 --> 01:38:10.084
TYPES OF THINGS.

01:38:10.150 --> 01:38:11.385
BUT THAT IT'S A STANDARD THAT

01:38:11.452 --> 01:38:13.254
EVERY COUNTY IN CALIFORNIA CAN

01:38:13.320 --> 01:38:14.888
LOOK AT AND SAY THESE ARE THE

01:38:14.955 --> 01:38:16.056
BEST PRACTICES.

01:38:16.123 --> 01:38:17.057
THIS IS THE WAY WE SHOULD DO IT

01:38:17.124 --> 01:38:18.659
AND COUNTIES ARE NOT LEFT TO

01:38:18.726 --> 01:38:21.495
THEMSELVES TO DO THIS ON AN AD

01:38:21.562 --> 01:38:23.230
HOC BASIS THE WAY THEY THINK THE

01:38:23.297 --> 01:38:23.797
BASS.

01:38:23.864 --> 01:38:24.765
AND I'M I'M VERY MUCH FOR

01:38:24.832 --> 01:38:26.000
COUNTIES BEING ABLE TO MAKE

01:38:26.066 --> 01:38:27.801
THOSE TYPES OF DECISIONS BUT IF

01:38:27.868 --> 01:38:28.636
THEY'RE NOT FOLLOWING THE BEST

01:38:28.702 --> 01:38:30.337
PRACTICES THEN THEY'RE NOT DOING

01:38:30.404 --> 01:38:37.511
IT PROPERLY.

01:38:37.578 --> 01:38:42.650
I HOPE THAT ANSWERS THE QUESTION.

01:38:42.716 --> 01:38:43.817
I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE SOME SOME

01:38:43.884 --> 01:38:44.885
BACKGROUND FROM A SCHOOL MENTAL

01:38:44.952 --> 01:38:46.654
HEALTH PROVIDERS -- POSITION SO

01:38:46.720 --> 01:38:48.022
WHEN I STARTED MY CAREER IT WAS

01:38:48.088 --> 01:38:48.789
OUTSIDE OF BALTIMORE.

01:38:48.856 --> 01:38:49.423
IN MARYLAND AND I WORKED IN AN

01:38:49.490 --> 01:38:50.457
ALTERNATIVE EDUCATION SYSTEM

01:38:50.524 --> 01:38:52.259
THAT HAD VERY AT RISK YOUTH.

01:38:52.326 --> 01:38:54.395
AND I WAS TRAINED IN MY SECOND

01:38:54.461 --> 01:38:57.298
YEAR OUT ON HOW TO BE A PART OF

01:38:57.364 --> 01:38:58.632
A MULTI DISCIPLINARY THREAT

01:38:58.699 --> 01:39:00.768
ASSESSMENT TEAM AND I EXECUTED

01:39:00.834 --> 01:39:02.169
THREAT ASSESSMENTS -- WITH

01:39:02.236 --> 01:39:03.270
RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE

01:39:03.337 --> 01:39:04.805
SUPERINTENDENT.

01:39:04.872 --> 01:39:06.473
THERE IS A THRESHOLD FOR LAW

01:39:06.540 --> 01:39:08.042
ENFORCEMENT INVOLVEMENT FROM MY

01:39:08.108 --> 01:39:10.644
PERSPECTIVE THIS IS NOT.

01:39:10.711 --> 01:39:13.681
THAT THE EMPHASIS BEING ON THE

01:39:13.747 --> 01:39:15.215
THE LAW ENFORCEMENT PIECE OF ME

01:39:15.282 --> 01:39:17.551
IS SECONDARY TO THE EMPHASIS IN

01:39:17.618 --> 01:39:19.820
TRAINING EDUCATORS AND

01:39:19.887 --> 01:39:22.823
ADMINISTRATORS AND AND PROVIDING --

01:39:22.890 --> 01:39:25.092
DIRECTION ON WHAT YOU DO

01:39:25.159 --> 01:39:28.195
WHENEVER YOU HAVE AS A CREDIBLE

01:39:28.262 --> 01:39:30.998
THREAT AND SPEAKING AGAIN AS

01:39:31.065 --> 01:39:32.566
SOMEBODY WHO IS IN YOUR SCHOOLS

01:39:32.633 --> 01:39:34.935
AND THE LAST SEVEN YEARS.

01:39:35.002 --> 01:39:36.003
I I CAN SPEAK.

01:39:36.070 --> 01:39:37.471
TO ME UNFORTUNATELY A LOT OF

01:39:37.538 --> 01:39:39.206
CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE THE PUSH

01:39:39.273 --> 01:39:42.076
BACK HAS BEEN BECAUSE THERE IS

01:39:42.142 --> 01:39:45.112
NOT DIRECTION FOR ADMINISTRATORS

01:39:45.179 --> 01:39:46.714
ON WHAT TO DO.

01:39:46.780 --> 01:39:50.284
AND IT AND AGAIN ONE PERSON --

01:39:50.351 --> 01:39:52.186
BUT VERY PASSIOATE ABOUT BEING

01:39:52.252 --> 01:39:54.922
PROACTIVE ON THIS TOPIC AND AND

01:39:54.988 --> 01:39:56.023
DO A CORNELL'S RESEARCH OUT OF

01:39:56.090 --> 01:39:58.258
THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA IS IS

01:39:58.325 --> 01:40:00.694
BY FAR THE THE THE DIRECTION

01:40:00.761 --> 01:40:03.297
THAT THAT WE NEED.

01:40:03.364 --> 01:40:04.064
TO ADD HERE.

01:40:04.131 --> 01:40:05.366
TOO RIGHT SO I THINK VERY

01:40:05.432 --> 01:40:05.999
SPECIFICALLY MISTER COLLEY TO

01:40:06.066 --> 01:40:07.067
YOU TO YOUR WITNESSES POINT JUST

01:40:07.134 --> 01:40:09.002
NOW I THINK WHAT ADMINISTRATIVE

01:40:09.069 --> 01:40:10.371
TEAMS AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE

01:40:10.437 --> 01:40:12.272
IN NEED OF PARTICULARLY IN WHAT

01:40:12.339 --> 01:40:13.907
IS THIS UNFORTUNATE NEW NORMAL.

01:40:13.974 --> 01:40:16.143
IS CLARITY AND I DO THINK THAT

01:40:16.210 --> 01:40:17.578
THE POINTS IN OPPOSITION RAISED

01:40:17.644 --> 01:40:20.314
BY THE ACLU PARTICULARLY HER

01:40:20.381 --> 01:40:22.850
MULTI POINT -- THINKING ON ON

01:40:22.916 --> 01:40:24.385
WHAT SHOULD BE ADDED TO PROVIDE

01:40:24.451 --> 01:40:26.420
THAT CLARITY WOULD BE WORTH

01:40:26.487 --> 01:40:27.354
CONSIDERING IS THAT SOMETHING

01:40:27.421 --> 01:40:28.122
THAT YOU'RE WERE CONSIDERING

01:40:28.188 --> 01:40:30.157
TAKING UP YEAH ABSOLUTELY AND I

01:40:30.224 --> 01:40:32.860
THINK THAT WE HAVE A QUITE A BIT

01:40:32.926 --> 01:40:33.427
OF COMMON GROUND HERE I MEAN

01:40:33.494 --> 01:40:33.794
THAT.

01:40:33.861 --> 01:40:40.567
THE POINT IS CERTAINLY NOT -- TO

01:40:40.634 --> 01:40:42.603
GET MORE KIDS INTO THE A LITTLE

01:40:42.669 --> 01:40:43.337
JUSTICE SYSTEM I THINK TO THE

01:40:43.404 --> 01:40:44.371
CONTRARY -- ONE OF THE

01:40:44.438 --> 01:40:45.406
ADVANTAGES OF HAVING -- A SET OF

01:40:45.472 --> 01:40:46.306
BEST PRACTICES IN A PROTOCOL IS

01:40:46.373 --> 01:40:47.207
NOT ONLY THE YOU MAKE SURE YOU

01:40:47.274 --> 01:40:48.742
DON'T MISS TRUE WARNING SIGNS

01:40:48.809 --> 01:40:49.443
BUT ALSO THAT YOU DOWNTOWN I

01:40:49.510 --> 01:40:50.544
OVER REACT TO THINGS THAT ARE --

01:40:50.611 --> 01:40:52.379
HARMLESS AND TRANSIENT AND SO I

01:40:52.446 --> 01:40:54.381
THINK THAT THE BILL SERVES THAT

01:40:54.448 --> 01:40:54.915
PURPOSE AND THAT MISTER

01:40:54.982 --> 01:40:56.517
MCCARTY'S POINTS ARE WELL TAKEN

01:40:56.583 --> 01:40:57.684
I MEAN THIS IS IT NEEDS TO BE

01:40:57.751 --> 01:40:59.219
COUPLED.

01:40:59.286 --> 01:40:59.820
WITH A RENEWED FOCUS ON MENTAL

01:40:59.887 --> 01:41:01.655
HEALTH -- AND THE PROFESSIONALS

01:41:01.722 --> 01:41:02.556

SYSTEM THAT REACTS ONLY WHEN

01:51:07.861 --> 01:51:09.496

FIRST IN HIS YEARS IN SCHOOL

02:25:04.395 --> 02:25:05.630
NUTRITION ONE HAS WITNESSED A

02:25:05.696 --> 02:25:07.465
TANGIBLE INCREASE IN DEMAND FOR

02:25:07.532 --> 02:25:08.499
HEALTHY FOOD.

02:25:08.566 --> 02:25:09.934
PARENTS AND STUDENTS ARE REALLY

02:25:10.001 --> 02:25:11.335
CONNECTING THE DOTS THEY KNOW

02:25:11.402 --> 02:25:12.670
THAT THE FOOD STUDENTS PUT INTO

02:25:12.737 --> 02:25:13.805
THEIR BODIES IMPACTS HOW THEY

02:25:13.871 --> 02:25:15.106

THEIR LONG TERM HEALTH?

02:25:19.043 --> 02:25:21.612
SECOND SCHOOL FOOD PROGRAMS ONLY

02:25:21.679 --> 02:25:23.081
THRIVE IF THEY SERVE FOOD THAT

02:25:23.147 --> 02:25:24.649
STUDENTS ACTUALLY WANT TO EAT

02:25:24.715 --> 02:25:25.950
THAT TASTES GOOD.

02:25:26.017 --> 02:25:27.485
VACAVILLE SERVES FRESH LOCAL AND

02:25:27.552 --> 02:25:28.786

02:25:28.853 --> 02:25:29.654
CAN.

02:25:29.720 --> 02:25:31.289
AND THEN ONCE EXPERIENCE THE

02:25:31.355 --> 02:25:32.056
STUDENTS REALLY TASTE THE

02:25:32.123 --> 02:25:33.357

STUDENTS TO THE SCHOOL MEAL

02:25:39.664 --> 02:25:42.800
PROGRAM HE THINKS THAT OFFERING

02:25:42.867 --> 02:25:44.735
ORGANIC ITEMS CAN HELP DO THAT.

02:25:44.802 --> 02:25:46.671
THE FINAL POINT ON AND MAYBE THE

02:25:46.737 --> 02:25:47.939
MOST SURPRISING HAS TO DO WITH

02:25:48.005 --> 02:25:49.340
THEFOOD THAT VENDORS OFFER TO

02:25:49.407 --> 02:25:51.075
SCHOOL DISTRICTS. ONE HAS FOUND

02:25:51.142 --> 02:25:52.743
THAT VENDORS OFTEN ASSUME THAT

02:25:55.313 --> 02:25:55.947
IT.

02:25:56.013 --> 02:25:57.148

02:26:01.419 --> 02:26:02.286
AND FREQUENTLY FINDING THAT

SEASONAL ORGANIC PRODUCE IS NOT

02:26:04.522 --> 02:26:06.390
THAT MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE.

02:26:06.457 --> 02:26:07.759
OUR HOPE IS THAT THIS PROGRAM

02:26:07.825 --> 02:26:08.826

02:40:38.528 --> 02:40:39.229

POINT I WOULD LOVE TO SEE.

02:40:43.934 --> 02:40:45.502

02:40:45.569 --> 02:40:48.472

02:40:53.543 --> 02:40:55.012

02:40:55.078 --> 02:40:56.980
PERSONALLY BECAUSE WE KNOW WE

02:40:57.047 --> 02:40:58.081

02:40:58.148 --> 02:40:59.549
BUT WE DON'T SEEM TO TAKE THE

02:40:59.616 --> 02:41:01.251
TIME. TO HAVE THIS CORD MADE A

02:41:01.318 --> 02:41:03.286

02:41:03.353 --> 02:41:05.055
DIFFERENT BILLS COMING IN AND

02:41:05.122 --> 02:41:06.289
THIS IS A MAJOR PIECE THAT

02:41:06.356 --> 02:41:07.958
AFFECTS AN AWFUL LOT OF KIDS AND

02:41:08.025 --> 02:41:08.825
SO I WOULD.

02:41:08.892 --> 02:41:10.794
I WOULD HOPE THAT WE WOULD BE

02:41:10.861 --> 02:41:12.896

HAS MULTIPLE PARTS TO IT BUT HAS

02:41:22.239 --> 02:41:23.840
SOME COHESIVENESS TO IT.

02:41:23.907 --> 02:41:24.608
AND THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS I

02:41:24.674 --> 02:41:26.510
WANTED TO SEE WITH THAT I THINK

02:41:26.576 --> 02:41:27.277

KNOW WHAT YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOING

02:45:35.258 --> 02:45:35.959
ON OUR STATE.

02:45:36.026 --> 02:45:37.360
CURRENT LAW HAS ESTABLISHED A

02:45:37.427 --> 02:45:39.062
SYSTEM OF POLICY MAKING DATA

02:45:39.129 --> 02:45:40.563

02:45:40.630 --> 02:45:42.098
IN PRACTICE.

02:45:42.165 --> 02:45:44.100
WITH THERE'S NO ENTITY TASKED

02:45:44.167 --> 02:45:46.670
WITH SUPPORTING UNDERGRADUATE.

02:45:46.736 --> 02:45:48.471
AND PRE SERVICE PREPARATION OF

02:45:48.538 --> 02:45:49.839
EDUCATION.

02:45:49.906 --> 02:45:51.775
OF EDUCATION PROGRAMS AND

02:45:51.841 --> 02:45:52.676
ALTHOUGH THE AT THE CHEAPER GAP

02:45:52.742 --> 02:45:54.444
AS WIDELY STUDIED NATIONALLY AND

02:45:54.511 --> 02:45:55.612
STATE WIDE.

02:45:55.679 --> 02:45:56.579
IN FACT IN THE STATE OF

02:45:56.646 --> 02:45:57.714
CALIFORNIA WE HAVE THE UC

02:45:57.781 --> 02:45:59.349
STUDYING IT AND I DON'T KNOW

02:45:59.416 --> 02:46:00.583
WHERE THAT RESEARCH ALWAYS GOES

02:46:00.650 --> 02:46:02.319
THE FACT IS WE NEED A ONE STOP

02:46:02.385 --> 02:46:03.420
SHOP IN THE STATE WHERE WE CAN

02:46:03.486 --> 02:46:04.554
HOUSES INFORMATION.

02:46:04.621 --> 02:46:06.589
THE BEST PRACTICES ASSOCIATED

02:46:06.656 --> 02:46:07.991
WITH CLOSING THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP

02:46:08.058 --> 02:46:09.259
AND WE CAN PUSH THAT INFORMATION

02:46:09.326 --> 02:46:11.528
OUT TO RATHER UNIVERSITIES SO

02:46:11.594 --> 02:46:12.329
WHY THE CSU.

02:46:12.395 --> 02:46:14.898
IT THIS ISSUE BECAUSE QUITE

02:46:14.964 --> 02:46:16.032
FRANKLY IT PRODUCES.

02:46:16.099 --> 02:46:17.867
THE MOST TEACHING CREDENTIALS IN

02:46:17.934 --> 02:46:20.003
FACT REALLY TO THE C. ISSUES

02:46:20.070 --> 02:46:21.471
PRODUCED MOST OF THE TEACHING

02:46:21.538 --> 02:46:22.839
CREDENTIALS SO THAT'S A NATURAL

02:46:22.906 --> 02:46:24.341
PLACE FOR FOR CENTER SUCH AS

02:46:24.407 --> 02:46:25.075
THIS.

02:46:25.141 --> 02:46:27.010
I THINK IT WOULD BE A GOOD THING --

02:46:27.077 --> 02:46:28.478
AND AGAIN I I THINK IT'S IT'S

02:46:28.545 --> 02:46:30.647
THAT ONE STOP SHOP THAT WE NEED

02:46:30.714 --> 02:46:32.048
AYE HERE I'LL GET UCLA COME AND

02:46:32.115 --> 02:46:33.783
LOOK WHAT WE DID.

02:46:33.850 --> 02:46:35.018
AND WHAT I WANT TO NOTE FROM A

02:46:35.085 --> 02:46:36.119
VERY YOU SEE WHEN THEY COME IN

02:46:36.186 --> 02:46:36.786
AS WELL I WANNA SEE WHAT DID YOU

02:46:36.853 --> 02:46:38.555
DO WITH THE INFORMATION WE WERE

02:46:38.621 --> 02:46:39.122
THEY ABLE TO USE IT IN A

02:46:39.189 --> 02:46:40.023
CLASSROOM.

02:46:40.090 --> 02:46:41.491
DID THEY TEACH IT IN A PRE

02:46:41.558 --> 02:46:43.460
SERVICE PROGRAM AND I DON'T HEAR

02:46:43.526 --> 02:46:44.594
THAT IT'S REALLY HAPPENING SO

02:46:44.661 --> 02:46:46.229
AGAIN WE NEED TO FIGURE THIS OUT

02:46:46.296 --> 02:46:47.564
AT THAT LEVEL CREATE SUCH AS

02:46:47.630 --> 02:46:50.333
CENTER AND MOVE CALIFORNIA'S

02:46:50.400 --> 02:46:56.005

FOR OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT.

02:47:00.143 --> 02:47:00.877
NICK ROMAN ON BEHALF OF THE

RUNNING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE

02:47:11.421 --> 02:47:14.124

BERKELEY THAT THE FOSTER CENTER.

02:47:29.372 --> 02:47:31.341
I HAVE NOT OKAY BECAUSE THAT'S

02:47:31.408 --> 02:47:31.808
FOCUSED ON CLOSING THE

02:47:31.875 --> 02:47:34.244
ACHIEVEMENT GAP AND THEY ARE.

02:47:34.310 --> 02:47:35.245
I JUST MET WITH THE DEAN THE

02:47:35.311 --> 02:47:36.579
OTHER DAY AND SO THEY HAVE SOME

02:47:36.646 --> 02:47:38.882
REALLY -- THEY'VE GOT A PC

02:47:38.948 --> 02:47:40.784
PROGRAMS ONE SOME RESEARCH GOING

02:47:40.850 --> 02:47:41.484
AND THEY POSTED THE FOSTER

02:47:41.551 --> 02:47:43.553
INSTITUTE WORKS WITH THE SCHOOLS

02:47:43.620 --> 02:47:44.554
IT WAS NAMED AFTER THE

02:47:44.621 --> 02:47:46.189
SUPERINTENDENT WHO WAS KILLED BY

02:47:46.256 --> 02:47:48.591
THE SYMBIONESE LIBERATION ARMY

02:47:48.658 --> 02:47:50.827
FOLKS SO -- WE JUST MET WITH HIM

02:47:50.894 --> 02:47:51.428
THE OTHER DAY AND THEY'RE AND

02:47:51.494 --> 02:47:52.695
THEY'RE DOING SOME OF THIS WORK

02:47:52.762 --> 02:47:53.863
SO I THINK IT WOULD BE GOOD.

02:47:53.930 --> 02:47:54.898
TOO AS A PART OF WHAT YOU'RE

02:47:54.964 --> 02:47:56.166
DOING AND I GUESS YOU'RE GIVING

02:47:56.232 --> 02:47:58.034
IT TO THE THE CHANCE TO SEE

02:47:58.101 --> 02:47:59.769
ISSUE PERSON -- TO ALSO LOOK

02:47:59.836 --> 02:48:00.870
INTO IT BUT I THINK THE UC

02:48:00.937 --> 02:48:02.572
CAMPUS HAVE SOME OUR PROBLEM --

02:48:02.639 --> 02:48:03.773
AS ALWAYS IS THE DISTANCE

02:48:03.840 --> 02:48:05.675
BETWEEN THE UNIVERSITY AND THE

02:48:05.742 --> 02:48:07.343
COMMUNITY IN TERMS OF WHETHER

02:48:07.410 --> 02:48:10.046
NOT WHAT THEY DO ACTUALLY SHARE

02:48:10.113 --> 02:48:10.647
IT WITH THE COMMUNITIES THAT

02:48:10.713 --> 02:48:11.381
WOULD TAKE IT.

02:48:11.448 --> 02:48:13.550
SO I I THINK IT'S A GREAT IDEA I

02:48:13.616 --> 02:48:14.117
THINK THERE'S SOME THAT ARE

02:48:14.184 --> 02:48:15.218
ALREADY IN EXISTENCE THIS

02:48:15.285 --> 02:48:17.520
DOESN'T PARALLEL WITH I DON'T

02:48:17.587 --> 02:48:20.190
KNOW WHAT WE DID WITH THE L. CFF

02:48:20.256 --> 02:48:20.990
WE STARTED UP.

02:48:21.057 --> 02:48:22.625
A PERSON WHO'S SUPPOSED TO BE IN

02:48:22.692 --> 02:48:28.631
CHARGE OF WAS CONE AT ONE POINT

02:48:28.698 --> 02:48:33.002
IS THAT STILL IN EXISTENCE.

02:48:33.069 --> 02:48:36.606
THAT'S THAT'S GOOD STAFF RIGHT

02:48:36.673 --> 02:48:37.874
THERE I GOT.

02:48:37.941 --> 02:48:39.442
DOES IT ALL THE TIME OKAY I

02:48:39.509 --> 02:48:40.810
MIGHT BE ABLE TO THIS ONE OF MY

02:48:40.877 --> 02:48:44.447
OWN THOUGH YEAH. ONE OF HER

02:48:44.514 --> 02:48:46.349
BETTER MOMENTS RIGHT THERE --

02:48:46.416 --> 02:48:47.016
BUT I YES THAT IS IN EXISTENCE

02:48:47.083 --> 02:48:47.617
AND I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE A

02:48:47.684 --> 02:48:48.351
CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT THAT

02:48:48.418 --> 02:48:49.118
ENTITY IS DOING YES.

02:48:49.185 --> 02:48:50.720
I REALLY DO -- BECAUSE OF WHAT

02:48:50.787 --> 02:48:51.321
I'VE I THINK WHAT I'M REALLY

02:48:51.387 --> 02:48:52.889
GETTING AT IS WERE OPERATING IN

02:48:52.956 --> 02:48:54.190
SILOS.

02:48:54.257 --> 02:48:56.626
IN MANY PLACES EVEN THIS

02:48:56.693 --> 02:48:58.094
BERKELEY THIS IS A THAT'S THE

02:48:58.161 --> 02:48:59.395
BERKELEY THE SAME HAND AGAIN I

02:48:59.462 --> 02:48:59.863
DON'T KNOW ABOUT IT.

02:48:59.929 --> 02:49:01.831
RIGHT SO -- BUT I DO KNOW THE

02:49:01.898 --> 02:49:03.533
LIKE THE UC'S ARE DOING A LOT OF

02:49:03.600 --> 02:49:05.001
RESEARCH FOR THE ARE PRODUCING A

02:49:05.068 --> 02:49:05.935
LOT OF TEACHER CREDENTIAL

02:49:06.002 --> 02:49:07.403
CANDIDATES RIGHT THAT'S REALLY

02:49:07.470 --> 02:49:10.240
DONE AT THE CSU LEVEL BY MARCH.

02:49:10.306 --> 02:49:11.841
AND THAT'S WHAT I MEAN I I I

02:49:11.908 --> 02:49:12.809
WANT TO TAKE THAT RESEARCH I

02:49:12.876 --> 02:49:14.077
WANNA USE THAT RESEARCH I WANT

02:49:14.143 --> 02:49:15.645
TO USE THE KNOWLEDGE OF ALL AND

02:49:15.712 --> 02:49:16.246
HE'S AND PUT IT ONE PLACE SO

02:49:16.312 --> 02:49:17.046
IT'S HOUSE.

02:49:17.113 --> 02:49:18.681
AND WE CAN IDENTIFY THE BEST

02:49:18.748 --> 02:49:20.750
PRACTICES CERTAINLY INFUSE IT IN

02:49:20.817 --> 02:49:22.118
OUR TEACHER CREDENTIALING

02:49:22.185 --> 02:49:23.987
PROGRAMS BUT ALSO GET IT INTO

02:49:24.053 --> 02:49:25.788
OUR SCHOOLS AS WELL AND I'M

02:49:25.855 --> 02:49:26.422
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE DO

02:49:26.489 --> 02:49:28.558
THIS BECAUSE I I GET A LOT OF

02:49:28.625 --> 02:49:32.095
PEOPLE THROUGHOUT THE YEAR TO

02:49:32.161 --> 02:49:32.629
LOOK AT WE'RE DOING WHAT.

02:49:32.695 --> 02:49:33.196
WE'RE DOING WITH.

02:49:33.263 --> 02:49:34.664
I I CAN'T BE THE THE GUY THAT

02:49:34.731 --> 02:49:35.798
HOUSES THIS WE NEED A PLACE IN

02:49:35.865 --> 02:49:36.933
THIS STATE WORDS HOUSE AND WE

02:49:37.000 --> 02:49:38.701
CAN FIGURE OUT SOME PROTOCOLS TO

02:49:38.768 --> 02:49:39.502
PUSH IT OUT.

02:49:39.569 --> 02:49:40.103
AND I THINK WE HAVE A CAUGHT

02:49:40.169 --> 02:49:40.970
HAVE OUGHT TO HAVE A

02:49:41.037 --> 02:49:43.172
CONVERSATION ABOUT THE C. C. E.

02:49:43.239 --> 02:49:44.974
OR WHATEVER WE CALL IT --

02:49:45.041 --> 02:49:47.010
BECAUSE THEY NOW MOVED --

02:49:47.076 --> 02:49:48.411
WRITING THIS AND ALMOST STATE.

02:49:48.478 --> 02:49:49.412
AND I DON'T KNOW HOW THE TEACHER

02:49:49.479 --> 02:49:50.947
CREDENTIAL CANDIDATES THEY'RE

02:49:51.014 --> 02:49:51.881
PRODUCING THERE BUT QUITE

02:49:51.948 --> 02:49:53.650
FRANKLY.

02:49:53.716 --> 02:49:55.084
THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP BY LARGE NOT

02:49:55.151 --> 02:49:57.287
ALWAYS IS ASSOCIATED WITH WITH

02:49:57.353 --> 02:49:58.821
LOW INCOME STUDENTS ENGLISH

02:49:58.888 --> 02:50:00.256
LEARNERS AND AND CERTAINLY SOME

02:50:00.323 --> 02:50:02.258
OTHER FACTORS.

02:50:02.325 --> 02:50:03.726
IN A NEEDS TO BE IN THOSE AREAS.

02:50:03.793 --> 02:50:05.161
WHERE THERE ISN'T URBAN SCHOOL

02:50:05.228 --> 02:50:07.196
TRANSFORMATION CENTER AT SAN

02:50:07.263 --> 02:50:10.366
DIEGO STATE WITH DR JILL JOHNSON --

02:50:10.433 --> 02:50:12.101
AND IT IS OF OF RESEARCH

02:50:12.168 --> 02:50:13.636
INSTITUTE AS WELL AS THE FACULTY

02:50:13.703 --> 02:50:16.272
DEVELOPMENT IS TEACHER TRAINING

02:50:16.339 --> 02:50:18.408
PROGRAM -- SO THEIR THEIR NUMBER

02:50:18.474 --> 02:50:20.043
OF THEM OUT THERE I I'M NOT SURE

02:50:20.109 --> 02:50:21.844
WHETHER -- DOING ANOTHER ONE IS

02:50:21.911 --> 02:50:23.580
IS ANY WE CAN TRY IT AND SEE

02:50:23.646 --> 02:50:25.081
OVER THE IF YOU GIVE THIS TO THE

02:50:25.148 --> 02:50:26.849
CHANCELLOR THEY WILL LOOK TO SEE

02:50:26.916 --> 02:50:28.318
WHAT'S IN THEIR SYSTEM AND TRY

02:50:28.384 --> 02:50:30.153
TO COORDINATE THAT BETTER.

02:50:30.219 --> 02:50:31.621
BECAUSE THEY'RE THEY'RE OF AND

02:50:31.688 --> 02:50:33.356
THE SOME OF THE GREAT WORK AND

02:50:33.423 --> 02:50:33.890
SOME OF THEM DO A LOT OF

02:50:33.957 --> 02:50:36.092
RESEARCH WORK WOULD NEVER RELATE

02:50:36.159 --> 02:50:37.226
TO CAMPUSES OUR SCHOOLS.

02:50:37.293 --> 02:50:38.361
URBAN SCHOOL TRANSFORMATION

02:50:38.428 --> 02:50:41.164
RELATES TO SCHOOLS AND THEY WORK

02:50:41.230 --> 02:50:42.165
WITH SEVERAL SCHOOLS ACTUALLY

02:50:42.231 --> 02:50:43.700
AND HAVE BASICALLY DEMONSTRATE

02:50:43.766 --> 02:50:45.168
THOSE SCHOOLS CAN IMPROVE IN SAN

02:50:45.234 --> 02:50:47.203
DIEGO SO IT'S SO THEIR NUMBER

02:50:47.270 --> 02:50:48.605
BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

02:50:48.671 --> 02:50:49.172
THOUGH THAT THAT WHATEVER

02:50:49.238 --> 02:50:50.340
THEY'RE DOING IS IS PUT TO A

02:50:50.406 --> 02:50:51.908
HIGHER LEVEL SO THAT WE CAN.

02:50:51.975 --> 02:50:53.142
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT AND UTILIZE

02:50:53.209 --> 02:50:54.911
IT AS WELL AS OTHER FOLKS UP AND

02:50:54.978 --> 02:50:55.979
DOWN THE STATE AND MAYBE IT'S

02:50:56.045 --> 02:50:57.680
ISSUE FUNDING OR WHATEVER MAY BE

02:50:57.747 --> 02:50:58.548
BUT I THINK.

02:50:58.615 --> 02:51:00.350
BREAKING IT TO THE TO THE C.

02:51:00.416 --> 02:51:01.851
ISSUE WHAT WOULD THIS DOES MOST

02:51:01.918 --> 02:51:04.287
OF THE THE CREDENTIALING OF THE

02:51:04.354 --> 02:51:06.656
STATE OF WOULD BE GOOD SO I I

02:51:06.723 --> 02:51:07.924
SUPPORT THIS I JUST HOPE THAT WE

02:51:07.991 --> 02:51:09.325
PAY ATTENTION TO SOME OF THE

02:51:09.392 --> 02:51:10.627
ONES THAT ARE OUT THERE IN THIS

02:51:10.693 --> 02:51:12.729
AND THE CHANCELLOR SHOULD.

02:51:12.795 --> 02:51:14.397
KNOW THEM I MEAN THEY YOU I

02:51:14.464 --> 02:51:15.765
ASSUME THEY SHOULD KNOW WHO'S ON

02:51:15.832 --> 02:51:16.733
THEIR CAMPUSES TO WHICH THESE

02:51:16.799 --> 02:51:23.706
MAJOR RESEARCH INSTITUTES YEAH.

02:51:23.773 --> 02:51:24.641
ADDED BY I GUESS FROM MY

02:51:24.707 --> 02:51:26.809
PERSPECTIVE -- AGAIN I'M INTO

02:51:26.876 --> 02:51:28.511
THE ONE STOP SHOP RIGHT -- AND

02:51:28.578 --> 02:51:29.178
THAT DOES MEAN FOR RESEARCH THAT

02:51:29.245 --> 02:51:29.779
JUST MEANS HOUSING IT AND THE

02:51:29.846 --> 02:51:30.446
BEST PRACTICES ASSOCIATED WITH A

02:51:30.513 --> 02:51:31.481
VARIETY OF THINGS GOING ON IN

02:51:31.547 --> 02:51:31.848

EACH OTHER'S DOING SOME SEEKING

02:51:42.892 --> 02:51:44.360
SOME COMMUNICATION YEAH WELL I
